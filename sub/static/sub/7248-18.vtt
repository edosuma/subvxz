00:05.586 --> 00:07.382
Everyone's awfully quiet tonight.

00:07.454 --> 00:09.717
- Sorry, Mom, I'm just tired.
- Me, too.

00:09.790 --> 00:11.051
- School.
- Work.

00:11.124 --> 00:12.715
- Life.
- Dig it, man.

00:12.793 --> 00:15.420
- Peace out, Humphrey.
- Mystery.

00:20.266 --> 00:24.099
This is ridiculous. Three intelligent women
sitting here in complete silence.

00:24.169 --> 00:26.466
There must be something to talk about.

00:26.538 --> 00:28.630
Do you know that every night at dinner...

00:28.707 --> 00:31.937
the Kennedy clan would sit
around the table having lively debates...

00:32.009 --> 00:33.805
about everything under the sun?

00:33.877 --> 00:36.401
They would quiz each other
about current events...

00:36.480 --> 00:38.947
historical facts, and intellectual trivia.

00:39.016 --> 00:42.143
The Gilmore clan is just as smart
and worldly as the Kennedys.

00:42.218 --> 00:45.812
So, come on, somebody say something.

00:47.023 --> 00:50.185
Do you know that a butt model
makes $10,000 a day?

00:50.892 --> 00:52.722
Camelot is truly dead.

00:52.894 --> 00:56.693
- Emily.
- In here. Just follow the crickets.

00:57.132 --> 01:01.067
I am sorry I'm late,
but I come bearing wonderful news.

01:01.135 --> 01:02.863
Siri, bring Mr. Gilmore a plate.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.426
I just got off the phone.

01:04.504 --> 01:07.200
- Would you like to change first?
- No, I'm fine.

01:07.340 --> 01:09.603
Siri, Mr. Gilmore's hungry.

01:09.876 --> 01:12.673
I'm perfectly capable
of putting a napkin on my lap.

01:12.746 --> 01:14.269
All right, I'm sorry.

01:14.347 --> 01:16.280
- You were on the phone.
- Long distance.

01:16.348 --> 01:17.473
- God?
- London.

01:17.549 --> 01:19.846
- God lives in London?
- My mom lives in London.

01:19.918 --> 01:22.511
Your mother is God? So, God is a woman.

01:23.188 --> 01:26.645
And a relative. That's so cool.
I'm gonna ask for favors.

01:26.724 --> 01:28.623
- Make her stop.
- Oh, that I could.

01:28.693 --> 01:32.025
- You spoke with your mother.
- Yes. She's fine and sends her love...

01:32.095 --> 01:34.927
- and she's coming to visit.
- What?

01:34.998 --> 01:36.328
- You're kidding.
- When?

01:36.400 --> 01:39.061
- I'm gonna get to meet my great-grandma?
- Lorelai I.

01:39.136 --> 01:40.966
- I was named after her.
- I figured.

01:41.036 --> 01:44.266
- Richard, when?
- You'll love her. My mother's brilliant.

01:44.340 --> 01:46.773
- We share that also.
- I'm asking a question here.

01:46.842 --> 01:49.571
Does no one hear me?
Am I suddenly invisible?

01:49.644 --> 01:51.440
I'm sorry. What was the question?

01:51.513 --> 01:54.606
- When is your mother arriving?
- A week from today.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.673
- Rory, I tell you, it'll be such a treat.
- Excuse me.

01:57.752 --> 02:00.151
I still can't get over
that I'm related to God.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.552
It's going to make
getting Madonna tickets so much easier.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074

03:00.407 --> 03:01.464
Mom.

03:03.243 --> 03:06.006
It's just like that woman,
no warnings, no discussion...

03:06.079 --> 03:08.205
then out of the blue,
'I'm coming next week. '

03:08.280 --> 03:11.009
- What are you doing?
- I have to unpack all these things.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.572
What things? Excuse me, boys.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.210
I have to get out everything
she has ever given us.

03:15.287 --> 03:19.985
Thirty-five years' worth of fish lamps
and dog statues, lion tables...

03:20.725 --> 03:23.284
and stupid naked angels with their butts!

03:23.361 --> 03:26.989
Stupid naked angel butts?
What, did David Mamet just stop by?

03:27.064 --> 03:28.963
- Leave, please.
- Mom, calm down.

03:29.032 --> 03:32.558
I can't calm down! That lampshade
is missing, and the china is cracked.

03:32.636 --> 03:36.036
I can't remember which table
she gave us for our 10-year anniversary.

03:36.105 --> 03:37.935
Mother, Grandma is a very old woman.

03:38.007 --> 03:40.668
I doubt she'll remember everything
she ever bought you.

03:40.743 --> 03:43.734
She'll remember down
to the last shrimp fork. You know why?

03:43.812 --> 03:46.575
- No. Do you know why?
- She doesn't just give you a present.

03:46.648 --> 03:49.013
She gives you one,
then tells you where to put it...

03:49.084 --> 03:51.483
how to use it, what it costs,
for insurance purposes.

03:51.552 --> 03:55.385
God forbid if you have a different opinion
or don't think it works in the space.

03:55.456 --> 03:59.084
Or you get tired of waking up every day
with those animals staring at you!

03:59.158 --> 04:02.092
- She's just upset.
- Stop talking to the dogs!

04:02.195 --> 04:05.061
You're freaking out.
I've never seen you freak out before.

04:05.131 --> 04:08.497
Yes, you have. You were 12.
It was the last time that woman visited.

04:08.567 --> 04:10.659
- Do you want some help?
- No.

04:13.005 --> 04:14.198
Please.

04:15.641 --> 04:17.574
- Where's it going?
- Third floor.

04:17.642 --> 04:20.041
- How about the second floor?
- Third floor.

04:20.111 --> 04:21.600
The first floor, on a ladder?

04:22.647 --> 04:25.706
- So tell me more about her.
- I don't really know that much.

04:25.782 --> 04:27.749
You know more than I do.

04:28.285 --> 04:31.515
Let's see.
She moved to London when Grandpa died.

04:31.721 --> 04:33.244
But she didn't like to travel.

04:33.323 --> 04:36.189
So once a year
Mom and Dad would go to visit her...

04:36.258 --> 04:39.488
usually leaving me behind,
much to my relief, by the way.

04:39.562 --> 04:42.257
That's it.
The rest I know from stories, just like you.

04:42.331 --> 04:44.389
Grandpa says I remind him of her.

04:44.465 --> 04:49.060
That is the biggest compliment that can
be wrenched out of Grumpy McFarlane.

04:49.370 --> 04:51.997
- I hope she likes me.
- She'll love you.

04:52.706 --> 04:56.004
- I hope she and Grandma get along.
- She'll love you.

04:57.544 --> 05:00.944
I think the basic structure
of the Elizabethan government is sound.

05:01.013 --> 05:03.776
The division of power between
the Monarchy, Privy Council...

05:03.849 --> 05:05.782
and the Parliament all seem to work.
Agreed?

05:05.851 --> 05:06.908
- Agreed.
- Ditto.

05:06.986 --> 05:09.146
Okay, so in establishing
our own government...

05:09.220 --> 05:11.813
I think duplicating a similar structure
would be good...

05:11.890 --> 05:15.052
with a few alterations.
Queen Elizabeth chose to remain unwed.

05:15.126 --> 05:16.922
She took on the burden of leadership...

05:16.994 --> 05:20.156
at a time when marrying
the Prince of France or the King of Spain...

05:20.230 --> 05:22.891
would've solidified her throne
while expanding her empire.

05:22.967 --> 05:24.399
Though it worked for her...

05:24.468 --> 05:28.028
and the concept of a woman ruling
without man is politically correct...

05:28.104 --> 05:30.037
I think we need to take a different tact.

05:30.106 --> 05:32.369
She does know
this is a make-believe government?

05:32.442 --> 05:34.102
You ask her, I'm afraid.

05:34.177 --> 05:36.838
In addition to the members
of the political branches...

05:36.912 --> 05:38.674
we'll also need a king and queen.

05:38.747 --> 05:40.941
Rory, Tristan, what about you?

05:41.316 --> 05:42.942
Us? No.

05:43.017 --> 05:44.415
- Yes, no.
- Why?

05:44.485 --> 05:46.645
- Because...
- I just don't want to be queen.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.051
Me neither.

05:48.122 --> 05:49.918
King. I don't want to be king.

05:49.991 --> 05:51.480
What about you? You be queen.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.856
I'll be the head of parliament.
I can't be queen.

05:53.927 --> 05:55.325
- Be both.
- I can't be both.

05:55.395 --> 05:56.656
Why not? It's our government.

05:56.730 --> 05:59.220
- It's not done that way.
- It can be though, let's vote.

05:59.299 --> 06:02.597
Henry VllI started a new church
when the old one didn't allow divorce.

06:02.668 --> 06:05.261
He also cut his wife's head.
Is he still your role model?

06:05.337 --> 06:09.136
I'm just saying we have the opportunity
to make any kind of government we want.

06:09.207 --> 06:10.935
- Why won't you be queen?
- I'll be queen.

06:11.009 --> 06:14.239
- There, make Madeline queen.
- Fine. You're queen, Tristan's king.

06:14.312 --> 06:15.778
I'll be the lady in waiting...

06:15.847 --> 06:19.009
the one with that low-cut,
blue-velvet Renaissance dress.

06:19.082 --> 06:21.208
Lady in waiting is not a political office.

06:21.284 --> 06:23.751
No, but they get all the sex.

06:25.188 --> 06:26.950
- What?
- Watch a movie.

06:27.023 --> 06:29.718
We are talking about government class.
Not the movies.

06:29.792 --> 06:32.817
Why can't I get one person
to care about this as much as I do?

06:32.895 --> 06:36.022
Okay, fine. I'll be the head
of the quarter sessions court...

06:36.097 --> 06:38.360
but I'm still wearing the dress. Happy?

06:38.433 --> 06:39.956
Out of my mind.

06:40.068 --> 06:43.161
Okay. I secured us the classroom
to work tomorrow and Sunday...

06:43.238 --> 06:44.898
so that by Monday, we'll be ready.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.166
- We're working all weekend?
- You're kidding.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.970
Take this.
It's an outline for the overall system.

06:50.044 --> 06:53.843
Point of methods, basic laws
and penalties, plus some random ideas.

06:53.913 --> 06:58.406
Please be ready to discuss it tomorrow,
9:00 in the morning. Don't be late.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.945
She designed the flag.

07:04.189 --> 07:05.746
- Question?
- Okay.

07:05.824 --> 07:08.291
- What's up with you and Tristan?
- What do you mean?

07:08.360 --> 07:11.294
- You seem weird around each other.
- No weirder than usual.

07:11.362 --> 07:12.953
- I disagree.
- You usually do.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.623
I think it's strange
that you didn't want to be queen.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.997
You know,
not all girls want to be queen, Paris.

07:18.068 --> 07:21.696
- Even Barbie ended up being a stewardess.
- Okay, if you say so.

07:22.172 --> 07:24.230
Read my manifesto. I want your thoughts.

07:24.307 --> 07:26.399
First thought: Lose the word 'manifesto. '

07:26.476 --> 07:28.875
- Too cabin-in-the-woods?
- Don't open your mail.

07:28.944 --> 07:31.537
- Right. How about 'doctrine'?
- Better.

07:31.814 --> 07:33.974
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

07:41.022 --> 07:43.751
- You left this.
- Oh, yeah, I did. Thanks.

07:44.591 --> 07:45.682
Sure.

07:48.929 --> 07:51.988
That could have been
a potential Marx brothers moment.

07:52.065 --> 07:53.827
- You go first.
- Okay.

07:56.702 --> 07:58.965
- I think we need to talk.
- About what?

07:59.038 --> 08:01.767
- Tristan, you know about what.
- No, I don't.

08:02.173 --> 08:04.265
Look, we have a lot of work ahead of us.

08:04.342 --> 08:07.333
We also have two and a half years
of being in the same school.

08:07.412 --> 08:09.709
I don't want things to be weird
between us.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.944
Don't you think it would be good
to at least try to talk about this?

08:15.018 --> 08:16.382
- Okay.
- Good.

08:18.388 --> 08:21.322
- I'm gonna go first.
- Right.

08:23.559 --> 08:26.152
- It's still not working.
- You did something wrong.

08:26.229 --> 08:29.356
No. I did the same thing I always do
when I pull up reservations...

08:29.431 --> 08:31.364
for the upcoming month,
but nothing happened.

08:31.433 --> 08:32.797
- You typed in the name?
- Yes.

08:32.868 --> 08:34.562
- You clicked on the April file?
- Yes.

08:34.635 --> 08:37.195
- You double-clicked on 'Confirmation'?
- I double-clicked.

08:37.270 --> 08:39.101
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I double-clicked.

08:39.173 --> 08:41.470
- You clicked twice?
- No, I didn't click twice.

08:41.542 --> 08:44.009
To successfully double-click,
you must click twice.

08:44.078 --> 08:45.374
I know what double-click is.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.969
You don't, or we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

08:48.047 --> 08:49.570
I'm gonna pinch you so hard now.

08:49.649 --> 08:51.878
I don't know what you have done.

08:51.951 --> 08:54.350
I can't fix it if you don't move.

08:54.419 --> 08:56.010
I double-clicked.

08:56.088 --> 08:57.247
- What's that?
- What?

08:57.322 --> 08:59.687
- That red thing with an 'X.'
- I do not know.

08:59.758 --> 09:01.952
It happened when you pushed
something funky.

09:02.026 --> 09:03.720
I push nothing funky.

09:03.795 --> 09:05.989
You have the funk, my friend.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.029
- Independence Inn.
- I need the hatrack.

09:11.101 --> 09:13.000
- The fish flies at night.
- What?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.361
- I don't know. Who is this?
- Your mother.

09:16.439 --> 09:18.463
Hi, Mom, I didn't recognize your voice.

09:18.542 --> 09:20.441
- I need the hatrack back.
- What hatrack?

09:20.509 --> 09:22.499
- The hatrack I gave you.
- What hatrack?

09:22.578 --> 09:24.977
The hatrack I gave you for Christmas
five years ago.

09:25.514 --> 09:26.673
Well...

09:26.749 --> 09:30.479
It's large, bronze with dragons or weasels,
I don't know.

09:30.552 --> 09:33.179
Some sort of lizard-type animal
you hang your coats on.

09:33.254 --> 09:35.949
- Yes, I remember it.
- Thank God. I need it back.

09:36.024 --> 09:37.752
You need a Christmas present back?

09:37.825 --> 09:39.553
- Temporarily.
- Why, Mom?

09:39.626 --> 09:43.254
Because Richard's mother gave it to us,
and she'll notice if it's not there.

09:43.330 --> 09:45.695
You gave me a used present?

09:45.765 --> 09:47.493
No, we never used it.

09:47.567 --> 09:50.296
- I can't believe it.
- You'll get it back.

09:50.369 --> 09:54.634
You gave me a secondhand present,
like something you got at the junk store.

09:54.706 --> 09:56.935
You're being dramatic.
It was still in the crate.

09:57.008 --> 09:59.567
You actually went,
'What should I get Lorelai this year?

09:59.644 --> 10:01.235
'You know what? I can't be bothered.

10:01.313 --> 10:03.109
'Let's give her something we don't want. '

10:03.180 --> 10:05.875
- You're not funny.
- What would Miss Manners say to this?

10:05.950 --> 10:07.849
If she met your grandma,
she'd understand.

10:07.918 --> 10:11.284
Now, please. Bring the rack with you
when you come tonight. Okay?

10:11.354 --> 10:13.184
- Okay, sure.
- Thank you.

10:13.256 --> 10:15.189
You're welcome. Bye.

10:17.894 --> 10:21.329
- So, we're supposed to talk.
- Yeah. Look, about the other night...

10:21.396 --> 10:24.990
- I was upset over Summer.
- Yes, and I was upset over Dean.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.796
So, then it doesn't mean anything, right?

10:27.870 --> 10:29.029
Right.

10:29.704 --> 10:33.002
So then, that's it.
We just chalk it up to a bad night.

10:33.074 --> 10:34.165
Okay.

10:35.076 --> 10:36.736
I'm sorry I cried.

10:36.878 --> 10:40.074
- No problem.
- I swear it had nothing to do with the kiss.

10:40.146 --> 10:43.114
I kissed you, you cried.
It had something to do with the kiss.

10:43.183 --> 10:46.879
I cried because I was confused,
and because I hadn't cried.

10:47.286 --> 10:49.685
I didn't cry because of the kiss.

10:49.955 --> 10:51.683
It was a nice kiss.

10:51.757 --> 10:53.087
- Yeah?
- Very nice.

10:53.158 --> 10:55.591
- Not at all crying material.
- Really?

10:55.660 --> 10:58.093
- Absolutely.
- Want to try it again?

10:58.263 --> 11:01.322
I think someone is recovering
from their heartbreak just fine.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.195
Yeah, I'm all better.

11:03.467 --> 11:06.094
I think I'm gonna swear off girls
for a while.

11:06.436 --> 11:08.369
- What?
- Sorry, nothing.

11:08.438 --> 11:11.201
You said you were going to swear off girls.
It's funny.

11:11.275 --> 11:14.004
- You don't think I can?
- No. I think you can.

11:14.076 --> 11:16.270
I just think it would be hard for you.

11:16.345 --> 11:19.108
It'd probably involve
some kind of lockup facility...

11:19.181 --> 11:21.171
and one of those Hannibal Lecter masks.

11:21.249 --> 11:23.648
Okay, yes, it would be hard,
but not impossible.

11:23.718 --> 11:26.709
Maybe it's not so much
swearing off all girls.

11:26.888 --> 11:30.152
- But swearing off a certain kind of girl.
- Meaning?

11:30.758 --> 11:34.386
Meaning next time you should pick a girl
with a little more substance.

11:34.461 --> 11:38.624
You know, a girl who's smart,
is driven and has ambition.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.828
You know, like Paris.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.060
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, why not?

11:43.136 --> 11:45.968
Paris is smart and cute and interesting.

11:46.172 --> 11:49.402
She does bring her own
unique set of baggage into the mix.

11:49.474 --> 11:50.735
A matching set.

11:50.809 --> 11:54.642
But she likes you. She's crazy about you.
She thinks you're amazing.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.875
- You want me to date Paris?
- Just think about it.

11:59.050 --> 12:00.516
Me and Paris.

12:01.052 --> 12:04.612
'Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a wonderful friendship. '

12:04.688 --> 12:06.917
- Who's Louis?
- Just think.

12:13.329 --> 12:16.388
- Come on, let's go!
- Relax. I'm almost ready.

12:17.132 --> 12:19.258
- We're gonna be late.
- No, we're not.

12:19.335 --> 12:21.859
It's Friday night.
The traffic's bad on Friday night.

12:21.936 --> 12:23.960
- Since when?
- Since the beginning of time.

12:24.038 --> 12:25.026
Let me do it.

12:25.106 --> 12:26.402
- What's up with you?
- Nothing.

12:26.474 --> 12:28.805
You've been ready and bugging me
for almost an hour.

12:28.876 --> 12:32.003
Usually I have to drag you
kicking and screaming to go to dinner.

12:32.079 --> 12:34.638
- You whine, complain and act like a child.
- I do not.

12:34.715 --> 12:37.512
I had to pay you $5 once
so you wouldn't go in sweats.

12:37.584 --> 12:41.246
Make your point and make it fast
as we move quickly to the front door.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.549
- My point is that you're mean.
- I'm not mean.

12:43.622 --> 12:47.057
You want to go to dinner to see
Grandma uncomfortable. That's mean.

12:47.125 --> 12:48.113
Okay, look.

12:48.193 --> 12:50.285
I will admit I work very hard...

12:50.362 --> 12:53.524
and sometimes I am a little tired
come Friday night...

12:53.598 --> 12:56.725
for the Gilmore family dinner.
But I had a light day today...

12:56.800 --> 12:59.768
and my grandmother,
who I haven't seen in years, will be there.

12:59.837 --> 13:02.703
It has nothing to do
with Grandma hating Great-grandma?

13:02.773 --> 13:05.297
- Not at all.
- When you see Grandma miserable...

13:05.375 --> 13:07.535
and uncomfortable, you'll be sympathetic?

13:07.610 --> 13:09.008
- Not at all.
- Mean.

13:09.078 --> 13:10.704
- I'm kidding.
- I want you to be nice.

13:10.780 --> 13:13.509
- I will be nice.
- No outward reveling in someone's pain.

13:13.582 --> 13:15.549
- I promise.
- Internal reveling only.

13:15.617 --> 13:18.016
- Okay. Then we can go.
- Okay. Good.

13:18.286 --> 13:19.377
Wait.

13:20.389 --> 13:23.221
So the internal reveling can continue
for years to come.

13:23.290 --> 13:24.381
Mean.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.530
Mean.

13:39.505 --> 13:41.836
God, this thing weighs like 1,000 pounds.

13:41.907 --> 13:43.897
I know. Here, put it down.

13:44.109 --> 13:45.735
What are we doing?

13:46.311 --> 13:48.676
- In case Gran comes to the door.
- Good thinking.

13:48.746 --> 13:51.407
I mean, she's 80.
The eyes have got to be gone, right?

13:51.482 --> 13:55.110
- Let's just try to keep her inside the house.
- Good thinking.

13:55.186 --> 13:57.278
- Do you have it?
- We got it.

13:58.155 --> 14:00.247
Hurry up. Bring it in here.

14:01.691 --> 14:03.385
Okay, quiet. Be quiet.

14:03.460 --> 14:07.452
Mom, thanks for the direction and all,
but we need some help.

14:08.330 --> 14:10.729
- Careful, honey.
- Watch it. Watch your head.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.064
Get it over there. Okay. Yes.

14:14.135 --> 14:17.035
I think that was...
It was maybe a little more on the left.

14:17.105 --> 14:18.298
I should've put tape down.

14:18.373 --> 14:20.431
You don't think the coatrack
could've moved...

14:20.508 --> 14:22.168
a quarter of an inch in five years?

14:22.242 --> 14:25.870
Yeah, you're right. That's it.
Okay, put your coats on it.

14:26.013 --> 14:29.038
How'd you get her in here
without her noticing it wasn't there?

14:29.116 --> 14:32.084
I brought her in through the back
and had Stella wax the floors.

14:32.151 --> 14:33.947
She napped, so that took about an hour.

14:34.020 --> 14:35.884
- Where is she now?
- In the living room...

14:35.955 --> 14:39.048
scratching the diamond pendant
I bought her against a mirror.

14:39.125 --> 14:43.254
- So we shouldn't keep her waiting?
- No, you're right, we shouldn't.

14:43.528 --> 14:45.051
Heaven help me.

14:45.864 --> 14:46.955
Stop.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.325
- Mom, look who's here.
- Who?

14:52.970 --> 14:54.095
Well, look.

14:54.171 --> 14:56.934
If I wanted to look, I would look.
I haven't looked.

14:57.006 --> 14:59.974
Therefore, you must draw
your own conclusions.

15:00.210 --> 15:02.734
- Thank you, dear boy.
- You're welcome, Trix.

15:02.812 --> 15:04.972
- Trix?
- Dad's pet name for Gran.

15:05.048 --> 15:06.514
Isn't it just darling?

15:06.582 --> 15:08.572
- Hi, Gran.
- Lorelai.

15:08.650 --> 15:10.640
Yes. It's so good to see you again.

15:10.719 --> 15:13.152
Trix, this is Rory. You haven't met her yet.

15:13.222 --> 15:15.451
No, I don't believe I have.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.046
- Hello.
- Come.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.449
I want to get a very good look
at both of you.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.155
- They're tall.
- Yes, they are.

15:25.332 --> 15:26.821
- How's your health?
- Good.

15:26.900 --> 15:27.957
Very healthy.

15:28.034 --> 15:31.469
Good, that means the majority
of your blood is Gilmore blood.

15:31.537 --> 15:34.972
- Gilmores don't get sick. Am I right?
- We wouldn't dare, Trix.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.303
That's right. Your mother is always sick.

15:37.376 --> 15:40.276
- I am hardly always sick.
- You're sick right now.

15:40.345 --> 15:41.902
- Are you sick now?
- Headache.

15:41.980 --> 15:45.039
Gilmore's don't have headaches.
Our heads are perfect.

15:45.116 --> 15:46.446
You don't drink.

15:47.218 --> 15:49.651
- Emily, get this woman a drink.
- I'll do it.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.346
Thanks, Dad. White wine.

15:51.421 --> 15:53.786
I'm going to get the hors d'oeuvres.

15:53.857 --> 15:55.448
So, you're Rory.

15:55.926 --> 15:58.894
- Yes, ma'am.
- My son speaks of you constantly.

15:59.028 --> 16:00.722
He seems very fond of you.

16:00.796 --> 16:02.820
I'm very fond of him, too.

16:03.099 --> 16:07.592
This little girl is as smart as a whip.
I think she has a great deal of you in her.

16:07.669 --> 16:09.295
Really? How nice.

16:10.205 --> 16:12.695
- Is this cheese?
- Yes, it is.

16:12.774 --> 16:15.105
Am I supposed to eat that cheese?

16:15.176 --> 16:16.233
Only if you like.

16:16.310 --> 16:18.675
Where are those spiced nuts
that Trix likes?

16:18.746 --> 16:20.042
I'll get some.

16:20.114 --> 16:23.173
So, Lorelai, since I've seen you last,
you've grown up...

16:23.249 --> 16:25.443
gotten pregnant out of wedlock...

16:25.518 --> 16:29.112
raised a child, and still haven't bothered
to get married.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.646
Have I left anything out?

16:31.924 --> 16:35.188
Some time in between growing up
and getting pregnant...

16:35.260 --> 16:36.749
I got my ears pierced.

16:36.828 --> 16:38.294
I've always hated scandal.

16:38.363 --> 16:41.559
However, I've always appreciated
self-sufficiency.

16:41.866 --> 16:43.924
Tell me, how do you support this child?

16:44.001 --> 16:45.297
I run an inn.

16:45.369 --> 16:47.302
- Hard work?
- Yes, it is.

16:47.371 --> 16:50.430
Good. Hard work is good for a woman.
Makes her stronger.

16:50.507 --> 16:52.838
I admire people who enjoy hard work.

16:52.909 --> 16:55.706
- Here we go. Spiced nuts.
- Thank you, Emily.

16:55.879 --> 16:59.041
I suppose I could just put these nuts
in my hand.

16:59.815 --> 17:01.543
I'll be right back.

17:01.650 --> 17:04.846
So, Gran, when was the last time
I saw you?

17:04.920 --> 17:08.480
You were still in your teens,
wild hair flying everywhere.

17:08.556 --> 17:10.250
I see you've taken care of that.

17:10.325 --> 17:12.758
Yes, I joined a support group,
bought a brush...

17:12.827 --> 17:15.089
and just taking it one day at a time.

17:15.162 --> 17:17.356
- That was a joke?
- Yes, it is.

17:17.497 --> 17:19.123
- Very good.
- Thank you.

17:19.199 --> 17:21.996
- I have dishes and napkins.
- Good for you.

17:22.269 --> 17:25.464
Richard, I would like to be escorted
into the dining room now.

17:25.538 --> 17:27.471
Your wish is my command.

17:28.941 --> 17:31.568
I'm not sure that dinner's ready just yet.

17:31.644 --> 17:34.771
Perhaps our presence in the dining room
will teach your help...

17:34.846 --> 17:38.747
that when one is told dinner is at 7:00,
people often expect dinner at 7:00.

17:38.817 --> 17:41.808
- But it's only 7:05, Mom.
- Only 7:05?

17:42.820 --> 17:44.684
In the event that I'm kidnapped...

17:44.755 --> 17:47.188
and ransom is demanded
at a certain time...

17:47.258 --> 17:50.954
I would prefer that Emily not be in charge
of the drop-off.

18:03.171 --> 18:05.001
Grandma, this dinner's delicious.

18:05.073 --> 18:08.564
Very good, young lady.
We all believed you.

18:09.076 --> 18:11.407
Now, let's talk about your education.

18:11.479 --> 18:13.537
- Where are you attending school?
- Chilton.

18:13.614 --> 18:17.344
- Rory is in the top 10% of her class.
- We're very proud of our Rory.

18:17.417 --> 18:18.849
She's going to Harvard.

18:18.918 --> 18:20.350
- Harvard?
- Yes, ma'am.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.979
Richard, how can you allow this girl
to go to Harvard?

18:23.056 --> 18:25.580
- Now, Trix...
- You and your father were Yale men.

18:25.658 --> 18:28.387
We want Rory to be whatever kind of man
she wants to be.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.984
- That's enough jokes for this evening.
- Sorry.

18:31.063 --> 18:33.087
Now, if you don't mind my asking.

18:33.164 --> 18:35.654
Chilton is rather an expensive institution.

18:35.733 --> 18:39.532
I'm curious how the manager of an inn
can afford such luxury?

18:40.338 --> 18:42.237
We're helping Lorelai out a little.

18:42.306 --> 18:45.274
Yes, we've seen to it
that Rory's education is taken care of.

18:45.342 --> 18:47.104
But it's temporary. It's a loan.

18:47.177 --> 18:50.145
I plan to pay them back every cent.
They know this.

18:50.479 --> 18:52.446
That's it. I'm done. Richard.

18:52.515 --> 18:54.948
Tomorrow, Rory, I shall plan the menu.

18:55.017 --> 18:58.315
When you've lived in Europe,
you learn a thing or two about food.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.650
I can't. I'm studying tomorrow.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.690
I'm in this study group
and our presentation is due on Monday.

19:03.758 --> 19:06.351
Very well, your mother can tell you
all about it.

19:06.428 --> 19:08.088
I will. I promise.

19:08.162 --> 19:09.526
Won't you have dessert?

19:09.596 --> 19:12.462
I once traveled to a small village
in Cambodia.

19:12.533 --> 19:15.057
I did not eat dessert there, either.

19:20.707 --> 19:22.298
What time is it?

19:22.742 --> 19:24.106
It's almost 9:00.

19:24.177 --> 19:27.805
Maybe I'll own a magazine some day.
Then I'll get all my nail polish free.

19:27.879 --> 19:29.539
I'm going back to sleep.

19:29.614 --> 19:31.808
- Tell Paris I hate her.
- Okay.

19:32.384 --> 19:34.613
- Hi.
- Hey, Paris. Louise hates you.

19:34.685 --> 19:37.152
You'll thank me
when you get into Sarah Lawrence.

19:37.221 --> 19:38.812
- Wanna bet?
- Hey.

19:38.923 --> 19:42.551
- Did you bring coffee?
- And doughnuts in the shape of clowns.

19:42.625 --> 19:46.390
- They've got hats.
- A clown just isn't a clown without a hat.

19:46.463 --> 19:48.760
- Here is your decaf with soy milk.
- Thanks.

19:48.832 --> 19:50.924
You're welcome. So I read your doctrine...

19:50.999 --> 19:53.728
and I think our imaginary kingdom
is off to a good start.

19:53.802 --> 19:56.361
- Yeah?
- Yeah. The taxes are a little high...

19:56.438 --> 19:58.905
and the landowner's power
should be regulated more.

19:58.974 --> 20:00.531
It was a different time then.

20:00.608 --> 20:02.768
But the fundamental human needs
were the same.

20:02.844 --> 20:05.403
- We're supposed to set it up within...
- Ding, ding.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.470
No debating until I've had coffee.

20:07.548 --> 20:08.946
And a clown?

20:09.249 --> 20:11.011
- Ladies.
- Hi, Tristan.

20:12.018 --> 20:15.316
- Paris, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure. Okay.

20:19.558 --> 20:21.991
And that is about what, pray tell?

20:22.061 --> 20:25.723
- I don't know. The project maybe?
- They could have talked project here.

20:25.797 --> 20:28.162
It's something else, something private.

20:28.233 --> 20:31.030
- Scandal.
- Maybe, though it is Paris.

20:31.269 --> 20:33.998
- Scandal lite.
- All the taste, but fewer calories.

20:34.071 --> 20:35.367
We could spy.

20:35.439 --> 20:38.566
We could wait for her to come back
to see if she wants us to know.

20:38.642 --> 20:40.802
Those who wait
for information to find them...

20:40.878 --> 20:42.902
spend a lot of time sitting by the phone.

20:42.979 --> 20:46.470
Those who find it themselves
have something to say when it rings.

20:46.549 --> 20:47.913
- Nietzsche?
- Dawson.

20:47.984 --> 20:49.473
My next guess.

20:51.053 --> 20:54.419
- What was with the confab in the hallway?
- We're dying here.

20:54.489 --> 20:57.651
Well, Tristan asked me out.

20:57.826 --> 21:00.055
- No!
- My, my, my.

21:00.261 --> 21:02.524
This is amazing. God, I'm jealous.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.392
Details. Don't leave out anything.

21:04.465 --> 21:06.728
We want every comma, apostrophe,
and ampersand.

21:06.801 --> 21:08.597
He just asked me out.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.224
- When?
- Tonight.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.995
- What?
- Nothing.

21:13.339 --> 21:16.068
- No, you 'hmmed. ' Why did you 'hmm'?
- Forget it.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.904
Louise, tell me why.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.873
- He asked you out for tonight.
- Less than 24 hours' notice.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.848
- So? What does that mean?
- Usually that someone else canceled.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.316
Or maybe he just got up the nerve
to ask her out.

21:28.386 --> 21:30.376
- Maybe.
- This is so amazing.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.514
- You are so far from Tristan's type.
- So far.

21:33.624 --> 21:35.523
Tristan usually likes his girls bad.

21:35.592 --> 21:37.991
We'll have to do
a Pink Ladies makeover on you.

21:38.061 --> 21:40.824
We'll turn you from a sweet Sandy
into a slutty Sandy...

21:40.897 --> 21:44.388
dancing at the school fair in high heels,
black spandex, and permed hair.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.525
- You can borrow my water bra.
- Excuse me?

21:46.602 --> 21:51.265
It's like a padded bra, but it's filled
with some sort of liquid so it moves.

21:51.373 --> 21:52.703
- It moves?
- Yes.

21:52.774 --> 21:55.241
- On its own?
- It makes you look natural.

21:55.310 --> 21:58.938
Great. Thanks, but I'll pass.
Everybody, come on. Let's get to work.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.037
I think you're gonna have a great time.

22:01.114 --> 22:03.911
- Yeah, it's just a date, right?
- Great.

22:04.251 --> 22:06.081
Okay, focus, people.

22:14.660 --> 22:17.457
Five-minute talking break while I change.

22:19.631 --> 22:23.157
My day: Big leak, third floor,
lots of things going squish...

22:23.235 --> 22:25.759
that should not be squishing.
Michel is no help.

22:25.837 --> 22:28.464
I'm late for dinner
which I'm bugged you're not coming to.

22:28.539 --> 22:30.529
- Which one? Blue, black, bad, good?
- Black.

22:30.608 --> 22:33.303
- Okay. Are you sure you can't come?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

22:33.377 --> 22:36.243
If I'm not prepared tomorrow,
Paris will send me to the Tower.

22:36.312 --> 22:38.802
If things go well tonight,
I bet it'll help tomorrow.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.906
- Tonight?
- She's going on a date with Tristan.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.780
- How'd that happen?
- Did some matchmaking.

22:42.852 --> 22:46.287
How many times have I told you
not to butt into other people's business?

22:46.355 --> 22:47.616
- Never.
- Good. Go on.

22:47.689 --> 22:49.622
- That's all.
- I want details tomorrow.

22:49.691 --> 22:51.715
- How do I look?
- Beautiful.

22:52.260 --> 22:54.853
My five minutes are up. Let's go!

22:56.797 --> 22:58.525
There is money on the kitchen table.

22:58.599 --> 23:01.931
There's really good chocolate cake
I defrosted for you this morning.

23:02.002 --> 23:04.492
Call me if you need me.
I'll be home early. What else?

23:04.571 --> 23:06.765
- Don't be mean to Grandma.
- Yeah, broken record.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.329
- Okay, I'm gone.
- Be good.

23:08.408 --> 23:09.806
- Bye!
- Bye.

23:26.424 --> 23:28.618
- I don't know what to wear.
- Ever?

23:28.692 --> 23:31.091
On my date with Tristan.
I'm not a trendy girl.

23:31.161 --> 23:34.425
I don't haunt the boutiques
hoping to find that fabulous little top.

23:34.498 --> 23:37.057
I study, I think about studying,
then I study some more.

23:37.133 --> 23:39.123
- Wanna come in?
- I only have one lipstick...

23:39.201 --> 23:40.565
and it's barely even a color.

23:40.636 --> 23:43.900
It looks like you're not wearing anything,
which is why I liked it.

23:43.973 --> 23:47.931
But to date, you need the fabulous top
and a lipstick you can tell you're wearing.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.475
You wanna put that stuff down?

23:49.544 --> 23:52.239
You said if I needed to talk,
I could come talk to you.

23:52.314 --> 23:53.712
- Yes, I did.
- Here I am.

23:53.781 --> 23:55.407
- Can I ask you a question?
- Okay.

23:55.482 --> 23:59.349
Why didn't you go to Madeline or Louise?
They'd get that 'fabulous top' thing.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.614
That they get.
The supportive 'you'll be fine...

24:01.688 --> 24:04.713
'and not throw up on the way
to his car'thing, that they don't get.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.257
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

24:06.326 --> 24:10.557
I brought everything in case there was
hidden potential in something I didn't see.

24:10.696 --> 24:12.959
- So?
- You'd be one well-dressed widow.

24:13.031 --> 24:15.328
- Forget it. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are. Come on.

24:15.400 --> 24:18.027
This is your entire wardrobe?
Nothing's left at home?

24:18.103 --> 24:21.833
Just my uniform and my bat mitzvah dress
with menorahs on the collar.

24:21.906 --> 24:23.338
Let's think.

24:23.641 --> 24:25.301
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

24:25.376 --> 24:27.673
To our one-stop shopping store.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.913
- This is your mother's room?
- Yes, it is.

24:31.982 --> 24:35.439
- I can't wear your mother's clothes.
- You can. I do it all the time.

24:35.518 --> 24:36.643
What about this?

24:36.719 --> 24:39.152
My mother says pink
makes my head look small.

24:39.221 --> 24:40.278
Okay. No pink.

24:40.356 --> 24:42.118
- This whole thing is insane.
- Why?

24:42.191 --> 24:44.351
Tristan asking me out.
Why would he do that?

24:44.426 --> 24:45.449
Why not?

24:45.526 --> 24:49.359
He's gorgeous and experienced
and only dates likely trophy wives.

24:49.430 --> 24:51.659
He would be lucky to go out
with someone like you.

24:51.733 --> 24:53.529
He won't have to read the menu to you...

24:53.600 --> 24:57.035
or explain that the dancing trash bins
in the movie previews aren't real.

24:57.104 --> 24:58.627
It's gonna be much less stressful.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.797
All these years
I've hoped this would happen...

25:00.874 --> 25:02.738
and now it has, and I feel...

25:02.875 --> 25:04.034
I don't know.

25:04.110 --> 25:06.839
I don't have a lot of experience
in the dating department.

25:06.912 --> 25:09.379
You can't put it on your transcript,
what's the point?

25:09.448 --> 25:10.641
I know.

25:10.715 --> 25:13.512
Before Dean, I'd never had a boyfriend.
Or a kiss.

25:14.452 --> 25:16.043
I never even thought about dating.

25:16.121 --> 25:17.348
- Then you met Dean.
- Yeah.

25:17.422 --> 25:21.721
And he was so special and nice
and made me completely nauseous.

25:22.159 --> 25:24.752
- The best ones do.
- I couldn't even talk around him.

25:24.828 --> 25:28.024
I saw you at the dance. You didn't seem
to have any trouble talking.

25:28.097 --> 25:30.257
Or gazing annoyingly
into each other's eyes.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.357
But that was after
we'd been dating a little.

25:32.435 --> 25:35.301
After we started going out
and spending time together...

25:35.371 --> 25:37.235
it kind of got easier.

25:37.673 --> 25:40.072
Then by the third date,
everything was perfect.

25:40.142 --> 25:41.608
Do you miss him a lot?

25:41.677 --> 25:43.473
Yeah, a lot.

25:43.712 --> 25:45.269
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.540
But tonight is not about me.

25:47.615 --> 25:51.345
Tonight is about you
going out with Tristan in this outfit.

25:52.620 --> 25:55.144
- What do you think?
- It's okay.

25:55.355 --> 25:56.719
- It's great.
- Put it on.

25:56.790 --> 25:58.984
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, bathroom's down the hall.

25:59.059 --> 26:02.425
I'll get you a lipstick
with some actual color in it.

26:14.572 --> 26:17.972
Paris, what are these cards
that fell out of your jacket?

26:18.042 --> 26:19.906
Those are notes for tonight.

26:19.976 --> 26:22.535
- Notes?
- Yeah, just some reference points.

26:22.612 --> 26:25.171
Subjects to bring up
in case the conversation lags.

26:25.248 --> 26:28.705
Can I suggest that you leave this one
about the Spanish Inquisition out?

26:28.784 --> 26:30.546
- Not very romantic?
- Not really.

26:30.619 --> 26:32.176
Okay, I'm dressed.

26:32.254 --> 26:33.743
- How's it look?
- Bad.

26:33.823 --> 26:36.689
I don't trust your opinion on that.
Come out here, please.

26:36.759 --> 26:38.623
Fine, but it looks bad.

26:39.194 --> 26:40.854
- You look great!
- I feel weird.

26:40.929 --> 26:42.953
Weird works for you
because you look amazing.

26:43.031 --> 26:45.624
- Really? You're not just saying that?
- I swear to God.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.030
- Are you atheist?
- Excuse me?

26:47.101 --> 26:49.295
It affects the validity
of your swearing to God.

26:49.369 --> 26:51.700
You look great.
I wouldn't say that if you didn't.

26:51.772 --> 26:54.740
- Lf you think it looks okay...
- The word 'amazing' was used.

26:54.807 --> 26:56.831
- Then I'll wear it. Thanks.
- Anytime.

26:56.909 --> 26:58.739
- I have to go.
- Lipstick.

26:59.779 --> 27:02.611
You'll hold this evening
over my head for the rest of my life?

27:02.682 --> 27:04.239
- Probably.
- Bye.

27:11.223 --> 27:14.589
- What did you think about the rabbit?
- I thought it was wonderful.

27:14.658 --> 27:15.988
I brought it with me.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.890
- Excuse me?
- From London.

27:17.962 --> 27:19.986
London has the best game.

27:20.097 --> 27:22.326
- You brought it with you from London?
- Yes.

27:22.398 --> 27:24.592
- Did you get it a seat?
- Dry ice.

27:24.701 --> 27:28.568
- That's inventive.
- It looks like we're finished here.

27:28.805 --> 27:31.432
Let's retire to the living room for a brandy.

27:32.708 --> 27:34.572
Lorelai, walk with me.

27:35.144 --> 27:37.941
I have something
that I want to discuss with you.

27:38.579 --> 27:40.705
I've been thinking
about something I heard.

27:40.782 --> 27:41.839
What?

27:41.916 --> 27:45.009
That you borrowed money
from your parents for Rory's school.

27:45.086 --> 27:47.645
If you're worried about them getting
the money back...

27:47.721 --> 27:51.156
Shakespeare once wrote,
'Neither a borrower nor a lender be. '

27:51.224 --> 27:53.282
Do you consider Shakespeare a wise man?

27:53.360 --> 27:54.485
Sure.

27:55.127 --> 27:57.617
We certainly don't mind loaning Lorelai
the money...

27:57.696 --> 28:00.289
- if that's what you're worried about.
- Certainly not.

28:00.366 --> 28:02.925
Rory is first priority in this house.

28:03.002 --> 28:05.629
I'm not concerned about
whether you mind or not.

28:05.703 --> 28:08.102
Loaning money is a dirty business.

28:08.173 --> 28:11.039
It's distasteful, and I don't care for it.

28:11.509 --> 28:14.306
As you know, I came into town...

28:14.578 --> 28:17.978
to check up on the family investments
and to talk with our lawyers.

28:18.048 --> 28:19.844
I have some things to put in order...

28:19.917 --> 28:23.249
and one of them
is setting up a trust fund for Rory.

28:24.220 --> 28:26.619
- That's amazing. Really?
- Now, normally...

28:26.689 --> 28:30.852
I would set up a fund so that she would
have access to it when she turns 25.

28:30.926 --> 28:34.053
However, considering the situation,
if you like...

28:34.129 --> 28:36.653
- I will arrange for her to get it now.
- Now?

28:37.165 --> 28:40.065
That way, she can use it to pay for Chilton.

28:41.001 --> 28:44.697
Gran, I don't know what to say.
That's so generous of you.

28:44.772 --> 28:46.864
My mother is a very special woman,
isn't she?

28:46.940 --> 28:48.429
You talk about me like I'm dead.

28:48.508 --> 28:50.737
You're never going to die.
You're too stubborn.

28:50.810 --> 28:52.333
Gran, this is...

28:52.412 --> 28:53.969
I don't know what to say.

28:54.047 --> 28:56.037
Nothing now would be preferable.

28:56.114 --> 28:59.480
I have arranged for you and your mother
and I to have tea tomorrow...

28:59.551 --> 29:01.677
before I leave. Say it then.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.714
Good night, Emily.

29:04.555 --> 29:05.680
Good night.

29:05.756 --> 29:08.883
I'll just walk Mother upstairs
and be right back.

29:11.395 --> 29:14.124
That was quite a bomb she just dropped.

29:14.531 --> 29:16.191
It certainly was.

29:17.367 --> 29:19.926
I guess I should be going.
Thanks for dinner, Mom.

29:20.003 --> 29:21.902
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:30.211 --> 29:33.008
You're not considering
accepting that money, are you?

29:33.081 --> 29:35.776
- Of course I'm considering it.
- I don't think that's wise.

29:35.850 --> 29:37.544
- Why not?
- Because she's a young girl.

29:37.619 --> 29:39.449
She won't know
the first thing about money.

29:39.519 --> 29:40.542
I'll help her.

29:40.621 --> 29:42.815
You don't know
the first thing about money either.

29:42.890 --> 29:44.618
But I'm familiar with the second thing.

29:44.691 --> 29:47.420
Can't you see the pitfalls involved
in accepting this money?

29:47.493 --> 29:50.427
You brag about how special
your relationship with Rory is.

29:50.496 --> 29:52.486
I'm stunned that you want to jeopardize it.

29:52.565 --> 29:55.761
- What are you talking about?
- You know that money means freedom.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.324
- And?
- Lf Rory has that money...

29:57.402 --> 29:58.891
she won't need you anymore.

29:58.970 --> 30:00.698
I don't know, she's 16.

30:00.772 --> 30:03.899
There's still some ways I may
come in handy, buying beer and stuff.

30:03.975 --> 30:06.169
I'm glad you think
losing your daughter is funny.

30:06.243 --> 30:09.609
She won't need you to pay for anything,
she won't have to turn to you.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.909
Everything in a relationship
isn't about money.

30:11.982 --> 30:14.006
- She'll move out as soon as she can.
- So what?

30:14.083 --> 30:16.880
She won't need your help for college
or to buy a car.

30:16.953 --> 30:20.615
Say goodbye to Dad for me as soon as
the voices in your head subside.

30:20.690 --> 30:23.180
Why should she wait
to backpack across Europe with you?

30:23.258 --> 30:26.784
She can afford to go herself,
and she can take a friend or a boyfriend.

30:26.862 --> 30:28.761
She wants to go with me.

30:28.830 --> 30:30.854
Now she does. She doesn't have options.

30:30.932 --> 30:33.195
- But the minute you give her options...
- That's it.

30:33.267 --> 30:36.133
You're nuts, and I'm going. In that order.

30:37.371 --> 30:40.339
It's terrible not to be needed. You'll see.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.499
- That is amazing!
- I know.

31:50.569 --> 31:54.004
One minute it's, 'Pass the pot roast. '
Then it's, 'Have a pile of money. '

31:54.072 --> 31:56.039
Things are never boring
at the Gilmore house.

31:56.108 --> 31:57.131
What did Rory say?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.469
- I haven't told her yet.
- What?

31:58.542 --> 32:01.442
- She was asleep.
- For that much money, you wake her up.

32:01.512 --> 32:04.105
You hire singing telegrams,
women jump out of cakes.

32:04.181 --> 32:06.808
People dress like bankers
and dance with those toasters.

32:06.883 --> 32:10.079
She's been working her butt off all week
on this Chilton paper...

32:10.153 --> 32:12.882
- so I let her sleep. I'll tell her tonight.
- Call her now.

32:12.956 --> 32:14.547
Or page her and have her call me...

32:14.623 --> 32:17.989
and we can sing The Money Song
from Cabaret. You be Liza, I'll be Joel.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.424
- I don't know.
- I'm Joel.

32:19.495 --> 32:21.519
I don't wanna bother her at school.

32:21.597 --> 32:24.588
I can never decide.
Carnations: Tacky or retro?

32:24.665 --> 32:27.792
- You don't wanna tell her.
- Yeah, I do. I think.

32:28.970 --> 32:30.334
I understand the hesitation.

32:30.405 --> 32:31.735
- You do?
- Absolutely.

32:31.805 --> 32:36.070
Who wants to be the bearer of good news?
That hugging and happiness, a nightmare.

32:36.143 --> 32:40.135
I was thrilled when Gran told me about it
and I was gonna tell Rory right away.

32:40.213 --> 32:43.045
- But?
- My mother cornered me by the door...

32:43.215 --> 32:46.240
saying all this stuff about
how when Rory gets the money...

32:46.318 --> 32:49.252
she's not gonna need me,
and she's gonna move out sooner.

32:49.320 --> 32:52.083
- What? That's crazy.
- I know, and yet...

32:52.157 --> 32:55.455
Honey, come on. She's trying to mess
with your mind, you know that.

32:55.527 --> 32:57.619
- I do.
- She doesn't wanna lose control of you.

32:57.695 --> 32:59.559
She wants you
permanently obligated to her.

32:59.630 --> 33:01.927
- I know that.
- Then what?

33:01.999 --> 33:04.432
- Do you believe what she said?
- I don't know.

33:04.501 --> 33:07.264
You're right,
she wants to mess with my mind...

33:07.336 --> 33:08.927
and make me feel obligated.

33:09.005 --> 33:12.064
But what if the money
does change our relationship?

33:12.141 --> 33:13.767
- Impossible.
- Anything's possible.

33:13.843 --> 33:16.003
- Come on.
- I couldn't stand that.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.772
I like things the way they are now.

33:17.846 --> 33:20.473
- This is Rory we're talking about.
- I know.

33:20.549 --> 33:22.880
She's the most unmaterialistic kid
in the world.

33:22.951 --> 33:24.383
It's not about what she would buy.

33:24.452 --> 33:28.217
I don't care if she buys a house, or a boat,
or the Elephant Man's bones.

33:28.289 --> 33:31.382
It's just that...
You know, it's about the freedom.

33:31.459 --> 33:33.756
If I had access to all that money as a kid...

33:33.827 --> 33:35.851
I would've left the house so fast.

33:35.929 --> 33:37.828
- Faster than 17?
- No, I mean...

33:37.897 --> 33:41.161
God, I know this is crazy. I have
my mom's voice stuck in my head.

33:41.233 --> 33:45.396
It's like that annoying Cranberries song.
I hate that I let her get to me.

33:45.471 --> 33:47.836
Then don't let her. Call Rory and tell her.

33:47.906 --> 33:50.066
You'll see that nothing will be
any different.

33:50.141 --> 33:53.109
I don't want her to go to Europe
without me. That's our thing.

33:53.177 --> 33:55.474
She's not gonna go without you.
I promise.

33:57.115 --> 34:00.015
- No. I've got to go home.
- Why? What are you doing?

34:00.083 --> 34:03.779
I have to change and go to tea
with Gran and the cast of Gaslight.

34:04.121 --> 34:06.145
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

34:06.989 --> 34:09.581
I can't talk to you when you're hysterical.

34:09.658 --> 34:12.784
- You make me hysterical.
- I am tired of fighting about this.

34:12.862 --> 34:15.351
You have got to get her
to take that offer back.

34:15.431 --> 34:18.126
Richard Gilmore,
I've put up with a lot from this woman.

34:18.199 --> 34:19.255
Keep your voice down.

34:19.333 --> 34:21.324
- But this time she's gone too far!
- Please.

34:21.402 --> 34:22.425
I can go louder!

34:22.504 --> 34:25.063
If I do as you ask,
I'll be insulting my mother.

34:25.139 --> 34:27.299
- I will not do that.
- You listen to me.

34:27.373 --> 34:29.967
I don't care if she demeans me
and looks down on me.

34:30.043 --> 34:32.840
I don't care if she thinks
I've tarnished the Gilmore name.

34:32.911 --> 34:35.344
I don't care if she thinks
I'm the Whore of Babylon.

34:35.414 --> 34:39.610
I've long ago given up any hope
of getting into her psychotic good graces.

34:39.685 --> 34:43.120
But that woman is horrible and selfish.
She cannot get away with this.

34:43.188 --> 34:45.485
- I won't let her.
- You're talking about my mother.

34:45.556 --> 34:49.286
Yes. Your mother, the one who stepped in
without being asked...

34:49.360 --> 34:52.056
and single-handedly wrecked everything.

34:55.166 --> 34:56.893
What is this about?

34:58.102 --> 34:59.728
She'll never come back here.

34:59.802 --> 35:02.429
- Who, Mother? Of course she will.
- Lorelai.

35:02.505 --> 35:03.630
What?

35:03.873 --> 35:07.205
If she gets that money,
Lorelai will never come back here.

35:07.277 --> 35:08.937
She won't have to.

35:10.412 --> 35:13.244
I've ordered a car. Women shouldn't drive.

35:13.515 --> 35:15.573
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

35:21.522 --> 35:23.614
I shall die soon, you know.

35:27.627 --> 35:31.027
Aren't we early?
Trying to suck up to parliament?

35:31.097 --> 35:33.496
- How'd it go last night?
- It went.

35:33.766 --> 35:35.824
- It went well?
- He picked me up...

35:35.901 --> 35:38.698
we went to dinner and a movie,
I didn't use my notecards...

35:38.771 --> 35:41.603
- and he kissed me good night.
- Paris, I'm so glad.

35:41.674 --> 35:43.140
It was a great kiss.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.868
See? All that nervousness for nothing.

35:44.943 --> 35:48.139
Yeah. God, this is so weird.
I can't stop smiling.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.440
Then it's the perfect time
to talk about our overtaxed peasants.

35:51.515 --> 35:53.607
- Let them eat cake.
- Hey.

35:57.020 --> 35:59.249
Don't look at me. I didn't kiss you.

36:05.461 --> 36:06.825
- Hi.
- Hey.

36:07.029 --> 36:09.997
I wanted to tell you again
that I had so much fun last night.

36:10.065 --> 36:12.123
After five messages
on my answering machine...

36:12.200 --> 36:13.723
I kind of got that impression.

36:13.802 --> 36:16.827
- Too much. Sorry.
- No, forget it. It was cute.

36:16.904 --> 36:18.894
Maybe we could do it again sometime.

36:18.973 --> 36:21.907
A different movie, of course,
but the same basic plan.

36:21.976 --> 36:24.500
- Absolutely.
- Great, because it was really fun.

36:24.578 --> 36:27.978
It was fun, and we should do it again.
I mean, as friends.

36:29.916 --> 36:32.349
- Yeah, as friends.
- You noticed it, too, right?

36:32.418 --> 36:35.113
That we're more friends material
than dating material?

36:35.187 --> 36:38.314
Yes, I did notice.
I have excellent deductive skills.

36:38.390 --> 36:41.153
- But I'm glad we did it.
- Sure.

36:41.226 --> 36:44.683
When Rory first suggested us going out,
I thought the idea was crazy.

36:44.762 --> 36:47.491
But she made some good points.
We do have a history...

36:47.565 --> 36:50.931
- and you never know, right?
- Yes. You never know.

36:52.135 --> 36:54.500
So we're done here, right?

36:55.639 --> 36:57.606
- Sure.
- Great. Excuse me.

36:59.876 --> 37:01.570
- What?
- It was your idea?

37:01.644 --> 37:04.612
So I get all your castoffs now?
I'm just that pathetic?

37:04.680 --> 37:06.909
'I don't want them.
Maybe I can con the suckers...

37:06.982 --> 37:09.541
'into taking out Paris the loser!
Throw the dog a bone!'

37:09.617 --> 37:12.949
- I am not your charity case!
- No, it's not like that, I swear.

37:13.021 --> 37:15.318
I just thought you guys
would make a good couple.

37:15.390 --> 37:18.825
We did, for one night.
But we're more suited to being friends.

37:18.892 --> 37:22.054
That's what was conveyed
so humiliatingly to me five seconds ago.

37:22.129 --> 37:24.358
- Paris, I'm sorry.
- I hate you.

37:30.670 --> 37:32.762
- You told her?
- I didn't know it was a secret.

37:32.838 --> 37:34.998
Why would you tell her?
What is wrong with you?

37:35.073 --> 37:37.666
Relax. We tried, it didn't work out.
It's no big deal.

37:37.742 --> 37:40.733
It's a huge deal to Paris,
and one date is not trying.

37:40.812 --> 37:42.210
You said you'd try.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.679
I'm sorry if Paris is upset, okay?

37:44.748 --> 37:48.547
But is it better that I keep dating her
even though I like somebody else?

37:48.619 --> 37:50.586
- Yeah.
- I didn't realize.

37:51.689 --> 37:54.088
So, you're still not over Summer?

37:55.491 --> 37:57.720
Yeah, I'm not over Summer yet.

38:19.512 --> 38:20.910
- Hi.
- Hello.

38:21.648 --> 38:22.841
Where's Gran?

38:22.916 --> 38:25.247
Torturing the bathroom attendant,
I suppose.

38:28.420 --> 38:30.717
This place seems clean.

38:31.623 --> 38:34.250
Yes, it's famous for its cleanliness.

38:35.027 --> 38:38.018
What did Rory say when you told her?
About the money, I mean.

38:38.096 --> 38:40.723
- She must've been very excited.
- Yes, she was.

38:40.798 --> 38:42.924
'Rose tea. ' That's funny.

38:43.967 --> 38:47.732
That's not really tea, is it?
It's like rose petals in hot water.

38:47.804 --> 38:50.271
More like a bad floral arrangement.

38:50.340 --> 38:53.399
- What did Rory say? Fill me in.
- She was happy.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.868
Yeah. She screamed,
she did that air lasso thing over her head.

38:56.946 --> 38:58.310
Be serious.

38:58.647 --> 39:01.945
She was asleep when I got home,
so I couldn't tell her.

39:02.016 --> 39:03.880
- She doesn't know?
- No.

39:05.787 --> 39:08.550
Something I said must've really
struck a chord with you.

39:08.623 --> 39:09.714
Excuse me?

39:09.790 --> 39:12.314
You didn't tell her,
so you must've had a reason.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.292
She was asleep. I just told you that.

39:14.361 --> 39:17.625
I think you must have reconsidered
based on our conversation.

39:17.698 --> 39:18.823
I didn't reconsider.

39:18.898 --> 39:22.264
Yesterday, you could hardly wait
to announce your great fortune to her.

39:22.335 --> 39:24.529
Today, all you can talk about
is rose petal tea.

39:24.604 --> 39:26.628
Yes, it's a little weird.

39:26.806 --> 39:30.070
You haven't told her that now she has
her own money for school...

39:30.142 --> 39:32.166
- and to go to Europe...
- Stop. Right now.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.837
This is just like you,
to take something that's great...

39:34.913 --> 39:37.847
and twist it into something ugly.
Why? What is wrong with you?

39:37.915 --> 39:38.903
There's nothing wrong.

39:38.983 --> 39:42.145
There's something seriously wrong
with you. You should be studied.

39:42.219 --> 39:45.517
I don't understand why you're so upset.
I respect your decision.

39:45.588 --> 39:48.181
- I made no decision.
- Whatever you say.

39:48.825 --> 39:53.227
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna call her and tell her right now.

39:53.295 --> 39:55.819
- No, you're not.
- Yes, in fact, I am.

39:57.032 --> 39:59.727
- What are you doing?
- The reception sucks in here.

39:59.802 --> 40:01.769
Stop it. You look like you're having a fit.

40:01.836 --> 40:04.099
Okay, I'm gonna go find a payphone.

40:04.572 --> 40:07.870
Your grandmother will be back
any second. Just have a sandwich.

40:07.942 --> 40:09.272
Have a sandwich?

40:09.343 --> 40:12.436
- That's what you have to say to me?
- What do you want me to say?

40:12.512 --> 40:15.969
Say that you are sorry you tried
to talk me out of taking this money...

40:16.049 --> 40:19.040
that you realize you were being petty,
controlling and mean...

40:19.118 --> 40:22.951
and you know that no amount of money
can change what Rory and I have.

40:23.022 --> 40:25.785
- That's what I want you to say. Say that.
- I will not.

40:25.858 --> 40:27.984
Say it or I'm finding a payphone.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.484
- You're here.
- Hi, Gran.

40:30.562 --> 40:34.053
- Have you ordered the tea yet?
- No, not yet.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.123
Good, because I'm going to have
to take my leave of you...

40:37.201 --> 40:39.430
a little earlier than I had anticipated.

40:39.503 --> 40:40.560
What? Why?

40:40.637 --> 40:44.037
My train leaves tonight, and I have
a little last-minute packing to do.

40:44.107 --> 40:45.539
I can help you with that.

40:45.608 --> 40:47.404
Plus, I really don't wish to witness...

40:47.477 --> 40:50.809
any more of this ugly little fight
you two seem to be having.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.440
Raising your voice during high tea.
Whoever heard of such a thing?

40:54.516 --> 40:56.380
It's like Fergie all over again.

40:56.451 --> 41:00.750
Gran, please. I'm so sorry.
We're done. Please don't leave.

41:00.822 --> 41:04.450
I can see now that offering
the trust fund was a bad idea.

41:04.758 --> 41:08.625
After all, taking into account
the maturity level of those involved...

41:08.696 --> 41:11.823
this large amount of money
would probably not be safe.

41:11.898 --> 41:15.560
No, that isn't true.
Rory is an incredibly mature kid.

41:15.668 --> 41:18.602
I'm sure she is. It's you I'm worried about.

41:18.671 --> 41:20.399
And I'm sure she gets it from you.

41:20.472 --> 41:22.496
Tell Rory goodbye for me.

41:22.574 --> 41:25.542
You two are welcome
to visit me in London anytime.

41:25.611 --> 41:29.137
Emily, please get my coat.
I will meet you outside.

41:34.852 --> 41:37.183
- You won.
- I did not win.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.379
You didn't want me to take the money,
I'm not taking the money.

41:40.457 --> 41:42.356
That's called winning.

41:42.726 --> 41:44.852
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

41:47.129 --> 41:48.493
Yes, I am.

41:49.865 --> 41:53.527
- Forget it, Mom. It's no big deal.
- No, it is a big deal.

41:53.602 --> 41:56.934
Here Rory had this wonderful opportunity,
and we... And I...

41:58.406 --> 42:01.397
- Maybe I can talk to her.
- Yes, that'll work.

42:02.443 --> 42:05.377
I'll go to your father. He can talk to her.

42:05.946 --> 42:08.505
He can fix it. I'll make him fix it.

42:11.484 --> 42:13.348
Damn reception. I'll go to a payphone.

42:13.419 --> 42:14.976
Mom, sit. Stay here.

42:15.054 --> 42:16.816
- But Chilton...
- Rory can still go...

42:16.889 --> 42:18.651
unless you're rethinking our agreement.

42:18.724 --> 42:21.021
No, not at all.
I am not rethinking anything.

42:21.092 --> 42:22.991
Okay, then we're good.

42:23.228 --> 42:24.694
Are you sure?

42:25.063 --> 42:26.461
We're good.

42:28.999 --> 42:31.762
I'd better go out there
before she leaves me here.

42:31.835 --> 42:36.533
- I'm sure you'll be sorry to see her go.
- I don't know what I'll do with myself.

42:36.607 --> 42:38.665
- See you Friday?
- See you Friday.

42:39.509 --> 42:40.975
- Mom?
- Yes?

42:41.044 --> 42:44.035
- Can I ask you one favor?
- Anything at all.

42:44.647 --> 42:47.274
Don't make us take the coat rack back.

42:48.383 --> 42:49.508
Deal.

43:05.198 --> 43:06.357
- Hi.
- Hey.

43:06.433 --> 43:07.592
- Here.
- Thanks.

43:07.667 --> 43:09.691
I thought you were gonna have tea today.

43:09.769 --> 43:11.827
- We did. We finished.
- Finished early.

43:11.904 --> 43:14.167
Once you're done
with those little sandwiches...

43:14.239 --> 43:16.468
there's no reason to pretend
you like tea anymore.

43:16.542 --> 43:18.338
I totally understand.

43:18.477 --> 43:20.341
There's something I have to tell you.

43:20.412 --> 43:21.469
What?

43:21.546 --> 43:23.069
I loaned Paris your black mini...

43:23.147 --> 43:25.842
and there's a good chance
you may never see it again.

43:26.818 --> 43:29.047
- There's something I have to tell you.
- What?

43:29.120 --> 43:31.747
- You lost out on $250,000 today.
- What?

43:32.305 --> 43:38.483
