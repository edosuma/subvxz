WEBVTT

00:00.329 --> 00:01.308
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.335 --> 00:02.935
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.269 --> 00:04.995
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.233 --> 00:06.255
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.656 --> 00:07.256
Who am I?

00:07.345 --> 00:08.484
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.485 --> 00:08.885
Castle.

00:08.919 --> 00:09.579
Castle.

00:09.580 --> 00:11.580
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.726 --> 00:13.916
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.126 --> 00:14.945
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.000
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.035 --> 00:17.941
- Nikki heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:17.987 --> 00:19.473
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.474 --> 00:20.474
I get to be on her case.

00:20.508 --> 00:22.451
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.486 --> 00:23.362
And together, we catch killers

00:24.310 --> 00:25.298
we make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.299 --> 00:26.299
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.433 --> 00:27.127
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.090
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.801
âª

00:54.127 --> 00:56.993
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
What the hell is wrong with you?!

00:57.028 --> 01:00.091
Can't you see
I'm driving here?

01:03.292 --> 01:08.650
âª

01:11.079 --> 01:14.478
âª

01:22.880 --> 01:25.373
Hmm. Initial impact size
is...

01:25.408 --> 01:27.808
14 inches.

01:27.842 --> 01:30.407
What are you doing?

01:30.442 --> 01:31.842
We're studying

01:31.876 --> 01:32.742
the practical application
of science at school.

01:32.781 --> 01:34.779
I'm focusing on forensics,

01:34.814 --> 01:37.246
specifically the physics
of spatter patterns.

01:38.256 --> 01:40.276
Oh.
What's wrong?

01:40.946 --> 01:42.778
Well, we usually do all your
science projects together.

01:42.863 --> 01:44.729
You remember
the volcano we made,

01:45.079 --> 01:47.078
the flatulent robot?

01:47.112 --> 01:48.511
Ew. I'm sorry, dad.

01:48.545 --> 01:50.344
I just got excited about it...

01:50.379 --> 01:52.345
And you weren't here.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.177
Oh, that's okay. I can help you finish.
Yeah--

01:57.647 --> 01:59.213
Beckett?

01:59.248 --> 02:00.881
Yeah. Um...

02:00.916 --> 02:03.749
I can stay home.

02:03.784 --> 02:07.617
Go ahead. I'll be fine
without you. Ooh.

02:07.652 --> 02:09.485
.5...

02:09.519 --> 02:11.518
Severe concussion...

02:13.952 --> 02:16.618
I guess I don't have to ask
about cause of death.

02:16.652 --> 02:19.351
He's not even my first death
by fallen object this month.

02:19.385 --> 02:21.351
Two weeks ago,
an investment banker

02:21.385 --> 02:23.385
took a frozen sausage
to the head

02:23.419 --> 02:24.487
from a tenth-floor window ledge.

02:24.497 --> 02:26.597
Well, it's a pretty old building.
Maybe it just fell.

02:26.921 --> 02:29.454
Maybe it got
a little help from someone.

02:29.488 --> 02:30.222
There's markings
here on the stone.

02:30.232 --> 02:32.052
What, a chisel?
Or a crowbar.

02:32.834 --> 02:34.334
I found marks up on
the parapet as well.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.839
I got C.S.U. dusting it
for prints.

02:36.874 --> 02:37.907
That's a long way to go
for a murder.

02:38.042 --> 02:39.610
Who'd want to drop
a gargoyle on someone?

02:39.620 --> 02:41.720
Well, someone who wants to
make it look like an accident.

02:41.986 --> 02:44.419
He'd have to make sure our
victim stood there long enough.

02:44.454 --> 02:45.985
Had someone tampered with
the front door lock

02:46.020 --> 02:47.620
when you guys arrived?
Give that man a prize.

02:47.639 --> 02:49.572
Yeah, we had to pop the lock
to get in the building.

02:49.607 --> 02:53.106
Super says our victim's name
is Will Medina.

02:53.224 --> 02:55.123
He's got an apartment
up on four,

02:55.158 --> 02:57.191
and guess who's got
the keys.

02:57.225 --> 02:59.158
I do.

03:00.626 --> 03:02.726
This place looks like
a museum.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.995
Well, that's because Mr. Medina
was the associate curator...

03:06.029 --> 03:07.762
at the New York
History Mseum.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.530
Well,
that would explain this.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.530
and I thought
a 100-inch flat screen

03:11.564 --> 03:12.865
would be the ultimate
bachelor accessory.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.124
Well, he wasn't
a total bachelor.

03:14.134 --> 03:15.334
What makes you think that?

03:15.558 --> 03:18.858
The... second toothbrush
in the bathroom.

03:18.893 --> 03:21.493
The scented candle on the tub.
The pair of high heels under his bed,

03:21.527 --> 03:23.427
all suggesting
that he was in a casual

03:23.462 --> 03:24.995
but steady relationship.

03:25.029 --> 03:26.529
Hmm.

03:26.563 --> 03:27.963
Nicely played.

03:28.031 --> 03:29.998
However I do think
you misjudged the relationship

03:30.032 --> 03:31.432
only slightly.

03:31.466 --> 03:33.400
"Eat, pray, love."

03:33.434 --> 03:35.301
Judging from the condition,

03:35.336 --> 03:37.269
I'd say she's read it
more than once,

03:37.304 --> 03:39.271
meaning that she's a woman
on the other side

03:39.305 --> 03:41.239
of a search for identity--
a romantic,

03:41.273 --> 03:43.006
someone who wouldn't
be satisfied

03:43.041 --> 03:44.874
with just
a casual relationship.

03:44.909 --> 03:48.077
And who's to say that
that book isn't his?

03:48.111 --> 03:50.879
Oh, I love that book.
Neighbor on two

03:50.913 --> 03:53.013
says the front door worked
just fine at 7:00.

03:53.048 --> 03:55.315
Which means
that the killer must have

03:55.349 --> 03:58.050
tampered with it after then.
Beckett, calendar.

03:58.085 --> 04:00.385
Check out today's date.

04:00.419 --> 04:04.221
"C.T. 5:30.
1127 Avenue of the Americas."

04:04.456 --> 04:06.090
5:30. That's two hours
before the murder.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.700
It's
an office building downtown.

04:07.839 --> 04:10.607
Let's check it out
after we finish our sweep.
Okay.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.075
You know, we might want to
swing down by the museum,

04:13.109 --> 04:15.010
see if any of his colleagues
can shed some light

04:15.044 --> 04:16.046
on who might want to drop
a gargoyle on Mr. Medina's head.

04:17.303 --> 04:19.202
Either you're being
a good cop,

04:19.237 --> 04:20.039
or you just want to go
to the museum.

04:20.048 --> 04:21.548
They have dinosaurs there.

04:21.773 --> 04:24.374
Let's go.

04:26.344 --> 04:28.278
Oh, man. I love this place!

04:28.312 --> 04:29.713
When Alexis was little,

04:29.747 --> 04:31.647
used to come here
every Sunday.

04:31.682 --> 04:33.616
We would run around here
for hours

04:33.650 --> 04:35.584
pretding like we were
on safari in Africa

04:35.618 --> 04:37.485
or looking for dinosaurs
in China.

04:37.519 --> 04:39.986
You know, Castle, sometimes
I forget that you have

04:40.020 --> 04:42.455
such a capacity for
pure innocence in your life.

04:42.489 --> 04:44.790
Yeah. Plus, it was
a great place to pick up chicks.

04:44.824 --> 04:47.759
And then you open your mouth
and you ruin it.

04:47.794 --> 04:50.795
Hi. I need to speak
with someone about Will Medina.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.796
I just can't believe
Will's dead.

04:52.830 --> 04:55.497
Dr. Raynes, how long did you
and Mr. Medina know each other?

04:55.532 --> 04:57.498
Two years.
The first thing I did

04:57.532 --> 04:59.465
when I got the job
as museum curator

04:59.499 --> 05:01.399
was to hire him away from
the U.S. Geographic Institute

05:01.434 --> 05:03.401
to lead
the Kan-Xul expedition.

05:03.435 --> 05:05.637
Kan-Xul?
The legendary Mayan king.

05:05.671 --> 05:09.306
What you see here represents
the single most important

05:09.341 --> 05:11.272
archeological find
in Mayan history--

05:11.306 --> 05:14.105
his burial chamber--where he
was entombed with a dozen

05:14.139 --> 05:15.873
of his mummified slaves.

05:15.907 --> 05:18.640
So kind of like a Mayan King Tut?
Exactly.

05:18.674 --> 05:21.106
You know, the exhibit opens
in less than a month.

05:21.141 --> 05:22.677
I-I can't imagine having to
do it without Will.

05:22.679 --> 05:24.079
He's the one
that discovered the site.

05:24.089 --> 05:26.289
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Medina?

05:26.786 --> 05:28.053
4:30 today.

05:28.063 --> 05:30.063
And how well did
the two of you know each other?

05:30.332 --> 05:33.300
Why?
I'm gonna have to contact
his next of kin.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.468
His parents are both dead,

05:34.503 --> 05:36.105
and I believe
he was an only child.

05:36.115 --> 05:37.715
And what about
his girlfriend?

05:38.855 --> 05:40.023
Last I heard,
he was single.

06:25.312 --> 06:28.014
What are you doing?! This
mummy's over 2,000 years old.

06:28.049 --> 06:30.749
Exposure to air
in an unfiltered environment

06:30.783 --> 06:33.651
could be catastrophic.
Sorry. I-I didn't--
I didn't know. This--

06:33.685 --> 06:36.153
Rachel. It's okay.
He's with the police.

06:36.310 --> 06:38.577
Rachel Walters is
our mummification expert.

06:38.612 --> 06:41.213
She worked with Will.
Did something happen to him?

06:41.247 --> 06:42.314
Uh...

06:42.348 --> 06:44.450
He was killed
earlier tonight.

06:44.484 --> 06:47.319
That--that's not possible.

06:47.354 --> 06:49.722
Were the two of you close?
Only professionally.

06:49.756 --> 06:51.957
Stanford--
it doesn't mean anything.

06:51.992 --> 06:53.893
It's just
a terrible accident.

06:53.927 --> 06:55.928
Actually, we believe
he was murdered.

06:55.963 --> 06:58.531
It wasn't murder.

06:58.565 --> 07:00.500
It was the curse.

07:01.633 --> 07:03.433
Detective Beckett,
Mr. Castle,

07:03.445 --> 07:04.911
Rupert Bentley,
our co-financier...

07:04.946 --> 07:06.779
Pleasure.
Of the expedition.

07:06.813 --> 07:08.546
I'm sorry,
did you say "curse"?

07:09.180 --> 07:10.347
Tell them, Stanford.

07:10.782 --> 07:11.582
Tell them what was written

07:11.617 --> 07:13.051
at the entrance
to the burial chamber.

07:14.599 --> 07:17.268
"All who gaze on the face
of the Mayan king

07:17.302 --> 07:18.836
shall be struck down
by his wrath."

07:18.927 --> 07:22.363
Mayan king?
This Mayan king?

07:22.397 --> 07:24.632
That very one.
They all looked inside,

07:24.666 --> 07:27.768
and they're all dead.
There were other incidents?

07:27.802 --> 07:29.403
All easily explainable.

07:29.437 --> 07:31.371
One of our grad students,
Nicole Graham,

07:31.406 --> 07:33.673
was mauled to death by a Jaguar
outside the dig site.

07:33.707 --> 07:36.308
And Professor Fisher
died of dengue fever.

07:36.343 --> 07:37.843
Which is common
in that region,

07:37.877 --> 07:39.644
as are curses
written above grave sites.

07:39.679 --> 07:41.746
It's how they kept people
from robbing them

07:41.781 --> 07:44.048
for thousands of years.
Well, I can assure you

07:44.083 --> 07:46.116
that whatever killed
Mr. Medina was very human.

07:46.151 --> 07:47.919
Do you know if he had
any enemies?

07:47.929 --> 07:49.349
Will was passionate.

07:49.554 --> 07:52.154
Nothing could stop him
from getting what he wanted.

07:52.189 --> 07:54.056
It's what made him
such a great archeologist,

07:54.090 --> 07:56.825
but it also rubbed some people
the wrong way.

07:56.859 --> 07:59.227
What do you mean?
The indigenous Mayans
he worked with

07:59.262 --> 08:01.229
claimed that he tricked them
into revealing

08:01.263 --> 08:02.430
the location
of the burial site.

08:02.660 --> 08:05.494
He'd received death threats.
And how do you know that?

08:05.529 --> 08:07.363
I'd received one, too.

08:10.939 --> 08:12.339
It's written in ancient Mayan.

08:15.484 --> 08:17.785
This is just like the one that
we found in Medina's apartment.

08:18.015 --> 08:19.348
What does it say?

08:19.382 --> 08:22.515
"Death awaits
the robber of graves."

08:26.016 --> 08:29.416
<font color=#7FFF00>âª Castle 2x19 âª</font>

08:35.110 --> 08:37.010
Great. Thanks.
That was the lab.

08:37.014 --> 08:37.981
They didn't find
any fingerprints

08:38.033 --> 08:40.634
on either one
of the death threats,

08:40.668 --> 08:42.534
which means all we've got
to go on is the postmark.

08:42.570 --> 08:44.203
So we're looking for
an angry Mayan

08:45.227 --> 08:47.995
who mailed a death threat from
Spanish Harlem three days ago.

08:48.030 --> 08:48.765
How tough can that be?

08:48.775 --> 08:49.975
Well, I called
the Mexican Embassy

08:50.099 --> 08:50.666
and asked them

08:50.701 --> 08:53.105
to put their feelers out to
the indigenous rights community.

08:53.498 --> 08:55.000
You never know. You might
get a decent tip.

08:55.010 --> 08:56.310
You know, this guy Medina--

08:56.938 --> 08:59.742
when he was a grad student,
he walked into the Amazon

08:59.776 --> 09:01.878
with nothing but a backpack
and some satellite images.

09:01.912 --> 09:05.417
He walked out a month later
with the golden head of Yax Pac.

09:06.027 --> 09:09.495
This guy is like Indiana Jones,
but with space-age technology.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.665
Ooh! Which would've been
such a better movie than that last one.

09:11.675 --> 09:12.295
Hey, Beckett.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.635
Hey, did you guys get lucky
with the mysterious "C.T."?

09:14.919 --> 09:16.286
Eight people
with the initials C.T.

09:16.466 --> 09:18.602
work out of
1127 Avenue of the Americas.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.194
None of 'em
have heard of Medina.

09:20.204 --> 09:22.004
And there's a coffee shop
on the ground floor.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.439
Maybe he met C.T. there,

09:23.473 --> 09:25.374
but none of the waitresses
recognized Medina's photograph.

09:25.408 --> 09:27.476
Anything on the girlfriend?
No one from the museum

09:27.510 --> 09:30.145
can even verify that
Medina had a girlfriend.

09:30.179 --> 09:32.748
And that second set of prints
that we found at his apartment

09:32.782 --> 09:34.716
doesn't match anything
in our system.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.851
So far this case
is nothing but dead ends.

09:36.885 --> 09:38.786
Mm. You know why?
Why?

09:38.820 --> 09:41.388
Because Castle's cursed.

09:45.174 --> 09:46.142
You had to tell them,
did you?

09:46.350 --> 09:48.483
Yes. Yes, I did.

09:48.518 --> 09:50.518
Well, gentlemen,
you'll be happy to know,

09:50.552 --> 09:52.653
I don't believe in curses.

09:52.687 --> 09:54.421
Seriously, bro,

09:54.455 --> 09:56.355
I saw a special on tv.

09:56.389 --> 09:58.524
Bunch of the guys
who found King Tut's tomb

09:58.558 --> 10:00.393
ended up dying
under weird circumstances.

10:00.529 --> 10:01.963
Yes, and there's
an explanation for that.

10:02.433 --> 10:04.900
Evidence shows that some toxins
were released

10:04.934 --> 10:06.169
when they opened
the sarcophagus.

10:06.179 --> 10:08.579
Well, didn't you say that
that mummy smelled kinda funny?

10:08.729 --> 10:10.897
Well, yes, but there was--

10:10.931 --> 10:13.633
and you did gaze upon
the face of the mummy?

10:18.059 --> 10:19.994
You guys, there is no curse.

10:20.019 --> 10:23.155
Ow.
Paper cut.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.090
Mm-hmm.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.727
Yes, <i>the curse</i>
gave me a paper cut.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.396
These things start small.
Then they snowball.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.300
Mm.
Yep.

10:31.310 --> 10:32.310
My <i>abuela</i> always said...

10:32.513 --> 10:34.415
Mm-hmm.

10:35.883 --> 10:37.718
Bad luck
always comes in threes.

10:37.752 --> 10:39.987
Threes, like celebrities.
They always die in threes.

10:40.021 --> 10:42.991
I'm living
in the dark ages here.

10:43.025 --> 10:44.660
Why don't you guys
check with Lanie

10:44.773 --> 10:47.442
and see if
she found anything, okay?
Mm-hmm.

10:52.749 --> 10:55.748
Medina's cell phone.
It was in his jacket pocket.

10:55.782 --> 10:59.215
I doubt gargoyle attack
is covered under his warranty.

10:59.249 --> 11:01.350
Get it--phone, warranty?

11:01.384 --> 11:03.218
I'll have tech
pull the SIM card.

11:03.228 --> 11:06.028
Speaking of gargoyles,
we found trace amounts

11:06.117 --> 11:08.084
of a substance
by the chisel markings.

11:08.118 --> 11:10.651
It was probably on the killer's
clothes and was transferred

11:10.686 --> 11:11.986
to the statue
when he pushed it over.

11:12.016 --> 11:12.952
What is it?

11:12.962 --> 11:14.862
The lab says they've never
seen anything like it.

11:14.987 --> 11:17.389
It's a mixture
of mostly organic compounds,

11:17.423 --> 11:20.391
including trace amounts
of pollen.

11:20.426 --> 11:21.693
Medina's apartment's
not far from the park.

11:21.756 --> 11:23.891
Maybe our killer cut through
there on his way to do the deed.

11:23.925 --> 11:27.760
Nice idea, but this pollen is from
a particular kind of calabash

11:27.932 --> 11:30.667
that only grows in the lowlands
of the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula

11:30.702 --> 11:32.602
where the dig site was.
Oh, it gets better.

11:32.637 --> 11:36.038
We found trace amounts
of the same pollen

11:36.073 --> 11:38.107
on both death threats.

11:38.643 --> 11:39.476
There's a good chance,

11:39.597 --> 11:41.564
whoever sent this
is your killer.

11:41.598 --> 11:43.098
And it's unlikely

11:43.132 --> 11:45.300
he would still have
trace amounts of pollen on him

11:45.334 --> 11:47.302
unless he had been
in the YucatÃ¡n

11:47.336 --> 11:49.337
sometime in the last few days.

11:49.371 --> 11:51.772
Uh, yes, we'll hold.

11:51.807 --> 11:54.175
Why is this taking so long?

11:54.209 --> 11:56.343
How many Mayans
from the YucatÃ¡n lowlands

11:56.378 --> 11:57.412
could possibly have flown
into the New York area

11:57.564 --> 11:59.965
in the last few days?
T.S.A. computers are down.

11:59.999 --> 12:02.066
Oh. Well,
that's reassuring.

12:02.241 --> 12:05.342
You know, Castle, this Kan-Xul
was no joke. Legend has,

12:05.377 --> 12:07.778
he personally conducted
hundreds of human sacrifices.

12:08.113 --> 12:10.513
You know why his burial chamber
was so hard to find, right?

12:10.547 --> 12:12.415
Because his own people buried it
so that he couldn't

12:12.449 --> 12:13.483
come back from the grave
and get them.

12:13.518 --> 12:16.586
Yes, yes, yes. Scary mummy,
I get it. Thank you.

12:21.670 --> 12:22.538
You okay?

12:22.548 --> 12:24.848
Yeah, yeah.
It's an old chair, that's all.

12:24.872 --> 12:27.740
Just, uh, keep telling yourself that.

12:27.775 --> 12:29.377
Yes.

12:29.411 --> 12:32.480
Okay. Uh, great. Could you
fax it over right away?

12:32.514 --> 12:34.415
Thanks.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.684
T.S.A. reports that
a Mayan named Cacaw Te

12:36.719 --> 12:39.320
arrived in J.F.K. four days ago
on a tourist visa.

12:39.355 --> 12:41.155
Cacaw Te? Cacaw Te?
C.T.!

12:41.190 --> 12:43.090
His visa application puts
his home address

12:43.125 --> 12:46.293
right in the middle
of our pollen zone.

12:47.929 --> 12:50.630
I'm guessing that guy was not
class clown in High School.

12:50.665 --> 12:53.500
This is a local address.
Let's go get him.

12:53.534 --> 12:57.003
Ooh, can I drive?
No.

12:57.038 --> 13:00.174
Can we call you Mr. T.?

13:00.208 --> 13:03.077
It's Te. Cacaw Te.

13:03.111 --> 13:05.313
You've got
quite a rÃ©sumÃ©, Mr. Te.

13:05.347 --> 13:07.282
According to
the Mexican Embassy,

13:07.316 --> 13:11.186
you were arrested in 2007 for
assaulting a group of tourists.

13:11.221 --> 13:14.156
They were trespassing
on sacred Mayan soil.

13:14.191 --> 13:15.826
You sent two of them
to the hospital.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.695
Things got out of hand, but that's not
why I'm here, is it?

13:18.850 --> 13:21.752
Sending death threats through
the U.S. mail is a felony.

13:21.786 --> 13:24.988
Oh, and so is murder, or as your
ancestors like to call it,

13:25.023 --> 13:26.457
human sacrifice.

13:27.689 --> 13:30.258
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

13:30.292 --> 13:32.626
Does this jog your memory?

13:34.062 --> 13:37.097
Medina refused to see me
when I went to the museum.

13:37.132 --> 13:39.367
I sent that because he
left me no other choice.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.010
And he needed to be told

13:42.044 --> 13:43.978
that the museum
must return the artifacts

13:44.013 --> 13:45.114
that they stole
from my people.

13:45.328 --> 13:46.728
Those items weren't stolen.

13:46.763 --> 13:48.732
Your government made a deal
with the museum.

13:48.766 --> 13:51.967
But not with us.
The Mayans are not a dead race.

13:52.371 --> 13:55.273
There are seven million of us
in Mexico and Central America-

13:55.307 --> 13:57.275
the direct descendants
of Kan-Xul.

13:57.309 --> 14:00.645
His remains and all that was
buried with him belong to us.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.948
Is that why you sent
the death threat to Medina?

14:02.982 --> 14:04.984
It wasn't a threat.
It was a reminder

14:05.018 --> 14:06.886
of the fate that awaited him

14:06.920 --> 14:09.088
if he did not return
what he stole.

14:09.122 --> 14:11.624
Where were you last night
between 7:00 and 8:00?

14:11.658 --> 14:14.928
I didn't kill him.
I didn't need to.

14:14.962 --> 14:17.964
Because all who suffer
from the mummy's curse

14:17.998 --> 14:20.033
are doomed to die.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.268
Hey, Beckett.

14:24.545 --> 14:27.346
Looks like Cacaw Te
isn't our C.T. after all.

14:27.381 --> 14:29.314
He was uptown meeting with
a Telemundo reporter

14:29.348 --> 14:32.148
about the, uh, injustice
of the exhibit at 5:30.

14:32.182 --> 14:34.514
He didn't finish
until after 8:00.

14:34.549 --> 14:37.015
Well, what about the pollen?
Turns out the area where
the expedition was camped

14:37.049 --> 14:38.815
would've been covered
with the stuff.

14:38.849 --> 14:40.880
Lanie says it's a safe bet

14:40.915 --> 14:41.845
that there's traces of it
all over the exhibit.

14:41.855 --> 14:43.455
Okay, but let's hold him
on the death threats.

14:43.555 --> 14:45.489
I got a feeling he knows
more than he's letting on.

14:45.499 --> 14:47.099
Contents of Medina's phone.

14:47.529 --> 14:49.329
There was nothing interesting in
the call list or the calendar.

14:49.461 --> 14:51.863
<i>But</i> we hit the girlfriend
jackpot with the photos.

14:52.673 --> 14:53.873
He's sleeping with a mummy?

14:54.053 --> 14:56.455
Ye--what? No.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.561
Oh, sorry. You have to flip
to the last one.

14:59.281 --> 15:00.948
Bam.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.051
That's Rachel Walters.

15:02.061 --> 15:03.961
No one at the museum knew
they were seeing each other?

15:03.985 --> 15:06.620
Maybe she's got
something to hide.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.324
Like murder?

15:12.333 --> 15:14.101
It started
after we got back from Mexico.

15:14.941 --> 15:16.041
Why did you lie
to everyone?

15:16.051 --> 15:17.651
I didn't want
to get fired.

15:17.762 --> 15:19.062
Why would Stanford
fire you?

15:19.187 --> 15:21.021
Because he and Will
hated each other.

15:21.897 --> 15:22.997
Why?

15:23.031 --> 15:25.032
Stanford blamed Will
for Nicole's death.

15:25.066 --> 15:26.369
The girl who was killed
in Mexico?

15:26.779 --> 15:28.779
Stanford put Will in charge
of all the grad students.

15:29.304 --> 15:30.371
He wanted Will to teach them

15:30.533 --> 15:32.600
how to survive in
such a hostile environment.

15:32.635 --> 15:35.302
When Nicole died,
Stanford was devastated.

15:36.427 --> 15:37.661
He felt Will
had betrayed his trust,

15:37.993 --> 15:40.061
letting her go alone
into the jungle at night.

15:40.409 --> 15:41.342
And ever since we got back,

15:41.377 --> 15:44.078
Stanford's been trying to
get rid of Will, but he can't,

15:44.487 --> 15:46.888
because Will's the one who
discovered the burial chamber.

15:46.923 --> 15:49.456
Do you think he would've gone
as far as murder

15:49.491 --> 15:51.959
to get rid of Will?

15:53.694 --> 15:55.061
Stanford told me

15:55.096 --> 15:57.597
that Will is the one that
should've died that night,

15:57.631 --> 15:59.298
not Nicole.

15:59.332 --> 16:01.600
The fact that Will and I
didn't get along

16:01.635 --> 16:04.036
doesn't mean I killed him.
Not getting along with someone
is a lot different

16:04.070 --> 16:06.204
than blaming him
for a girl's death.

16:06.238 --> 16:08.106
You thought he should've done
a better job watching over her.

16:08.116 --> 16:09.316
No, I thought
he shouldn't be

16:09.340 --> 16:11.507
sneaking into the jungle
to have sex with her.

16:11.842 --> 16:14.409
That's why she was out there
the night she died.

16:14.444 --> 16:16.312
Only Will stood her up,
and she paid the price.

16:16.322 --> 16:17.422
And how do you know this?

16:17.746 --> 16:20.681
I caught them together
two days before she died.

16:20.716 --> 16:23.184
I told him to break it off--
he was her boss--

16:23.218 --> 16:24.585
but he refused.

16:24.619 --> 16:27.387
That girl
had a bright future.

16:27.422 --> 16:28.857
And his carelessness
took it from her.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.867
Where were you
when Medina was killed?

16:30.891 --> 16:32.258
Right here, working.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.292
You can check with security,
ask the staff.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.597
I'm basically living here
until the exhibit launches.

16:36.607 --> 16:37.427
Great. Then we'll know

16:37.650 --> 16:39.219
where to find you in case
your alibi doesn't check out.

16:39.253 --> 16:40.620
Thank you.

16:41.854 --> 16:44.256
What happened to Will
wasn't the curse.

16:44.290 --> 16:47.592
It was karma.

16:49.961 --> 16:52.396
Do you believe that people
get what they deserve?

16:52.430 --> 16:54.431
Well, if they do,
then I must have done

16:54.465 --> 16:56.800
something pretty terrible
to be punished with you.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.667
<i>Funny.</i>

16:58.702 --> 17:00.436
Mr. Castle, Detective.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.404
Seen our new ad campaign?

17:02.439 --> 17:04.640
"Do you dare see...

17:04.674 --> 17:07.075
The mummy
of the Mayan king."

17:07.108 --> 17:08.776
Tasteful.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.878
Come on, Detective. You gotta
give people what they want.

17:11.913 --> 17:14.580
They are eating the curse up.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.518
Ever since the story broke,

17:16.553 --> 17:18.520
ticket presales
have jumped 20%.

17:18.554 --> 17:21.559
Yeah, but what about when
people come and see the mummy

17:21.593 --> 17:25.167
and then they get hit by a car
or slip on a banana peel?

17:25.202 --> 17:27.872
Then they're gonna Sue you.
I have to make a call.

17:31.609 --> 17:32.644
Okay. Thanks, Bill.

17:33.378 --> 17:34.279
Hey, did you get
a confirmation

17:34.313 --> 17:36.215
on Stanford's and Rachel's
alibis?

17:36.225 --> 17:38.125
Museum security
has them both logged in,

17:38.149 --> 17:40.050
but I haven't been able
to find anyone

17:40.084 --> 17:42.185
who could definitively state
that Stanford or Rachel

17:42.220 --> 17:44.621
were there during the hour
it would've taken to kill Will

17:44.655 --> 17:45.391
and get back to the museum.

17:45.401 --> 17:47.501
Yo. I think
I found something.

17:47.526 --> 17:50.261
Turns out our victim deposited
10 grand into his bank account

17:50.295 --> 17:51.298
four days
before he was killed.

17:51.308 --> 17:52.408
Where'd he get
that kind of money?

17:52.503 --> 17:54.371
Unknown, but he withdrew
the same amount

17:54.405 --> 17:56.173
the morning he died.
$10,000 in, $10,000 out.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.143
Sounds like
he's laundering money to me.

17:58.153 --> 17:59.153
Okay, you guys
check with the bank

17:59.267 --> 18:00.034
first thing in the morning.

18:00.069 --> 18:01.905
Let's see where that money came from.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.342
Ow!

18:05.976 --> 18:08.278
Ow!

18:09.039 --> 18:10.439
What happened?

18:10.474 --> 18:13.373
I don't know. I was
just gonna make a coffee,

18:13.408 --> 18:15.740
and... the cappuccino machine
started shaking.

18:15.774 --> 18:18.141
And just as I hit the deck,
it exploded.

18:18.175 --> 18:21.309
You could've been killed.
I know!

18:21.343 --> 18:23.878
Mm.

18:29.488 --> 18:31.489
Oh, very--okay.
Very funny.

18:31.523 --> 18:33.357
Yes, you got me.

18:33.391 --> 18:36.091
Ooh. I'm Castle.
I don't believe in curses.

18:37.971 --> 18:39.971
What, did you get bomb disposal
to rig something up?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.922
Yeah, it was all flash
and no damage.

18:41.932 --> 18:43.232
And the chair?

18:43.371 --> 18:46.239
I just pulled a couple of screws
and let gravity do the rest.

18:46.674 --> 18:48.942
Night, Castle.

18:51.236 --> 18:53.303
I'm not cleaning this up!

18:55.506 --> 18:58.341
I better clean this up.

18:59.876 --> 19:02.644
That was so mean.
Oh, I knew the whole time.

19:02.678 --> 19:05.312
Oh, sure you did.
You know, there are some mysteries

19:05.347 --> 19:06.780
that science can't explain,

19:06.815 --> 19:08.883
like Stonehenge
and DÃ©jÃ  Vu.

19:08.917 --> 19:11.653
And some curses are real,
like the scottish play.

19:11.687 --> 19:13.621
Oh, here we go.

19:13.655 --> 19:16.125
There's no one more
superstitious than an actor.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.962
The "scottish play"? Are you
talking about "Macbeth"?

19:18.054 --> 19:20.389
No, darling.
You never say the name.

19:20.423 --> 19:22.358
"MacBeth."
No.

19:22.392 --> 19:24.093
To do so...

19:24.127 --> 19:26.796
Is to invite grave misfortune.
No, I am serious.

19:26.830 --> 19:29.398
You know, I didn't--
I didn't know it at the time--

19:29.433 --> 19:31.367
I was in
my High School drama class,

19:31.401 --> 19:33.369
I said the name,
I wasn't thinking.

19:33.403 --> 19:35.304
For the next two days,
nothing went right.

19:35.339 --> 19:37.273
I mean, lady MacBeth
twisted her ankle,

19:37.307 --> 19:38.841
the three witches
caught pneumonia.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.276
Finally the director said,

19:40.310 --> 19:42.578
"all right, this is
what you have to do."

19:42.613 --> 19:44.013
I had to run around

19:44.047 --> 19:46.515
the outside of the theater
building counterclockwise,

19:46.549 --> 19:48.951
knock on the door
till someone let me in. Mm-hmm.

19:48.985 --> 19:50.820
Well, I'd love
to stand around

19:50.854 --> 19:54.690
and tell scary stories all day
'cause I'm really good at it...

19:54.725 --> 19:57.360
But I have a date
with a murder investigation.
Mm.

19:57.394 --> 20:00.129
It's lucky your father
doesn't believe in the curse.

20:00.163 --> 20:02.465
Why?
Because he's going into
a building...

20:02.499 --> 20:05.302
Full of guns.
I heard that.

20:05.336 --> 20:08.373
Hey, guys. What'd you
find out at Medina's bank?

20:08.383 --> 20:09.483
Well, it turns out the deposit

20:09.485 --> 20:11.119
and the withdrawal
were both made in cash.

20:11.356 --> 20:12.524
The bank manager remembers
the withdrawal

20:12.558 --> 20:14.359
because he had to
personally authorize it.

20:14.369 --> 20:15.269
The bank manager
was pretty sure

20:15.293 --> 20:16.557
Medina with somebody
at the time,

20:16.558 --> 20:18.926
so he pulled
the surveillance video,

20:18.960 --> 20:20.395
revealing this shining example
of thuggery.

20:20.405 --> 20:21.525
Any idea who he is?

20:21.629 --> 20:24.898
Do you wanna? You sure?
No, bro, you caught it.
Yeah, it's yours. Go ahead.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.402
You know, whenever you guys
are done being cute.

20:31.212 --> 20:32.412
No, he didn't.
Yeah, he did.

20:32.617 --> 20:33.885
Aruba is nice
this time of year.

20:33.895 --> 20:35.315
Meet Mr. Norton Grimes.

20:35.472 --> 20:37.373
He recently had the privilege
of doing two years

20:37.407 --> 20:39.308
for drug trafficking
at Franklin correctional.

20:39.342 --> 20:41.610
That's what the money was for.
Mexico is cocaine central.

20:41.644 --> 20:44.313
What better way to sneak drugs
into the country

20:44.347 --> 20:45.848
other than inside
an archeological shipment?

20:46.050 --> 20:48.251
Medina was in bed with a
drug trafficker, got him killed.

20:48.284 --> 20:49.818
You know, there's
a current address here.

20:50.052 --> 20:52.720
What's say we go see if he's awake?
Let's do it.

20:54.452 --> 20:56.254
Come on, Castle. Let's go.
Can I drive?

20:56.372 --> 20:59.474
Are you kidding?
You're cursed.

21:06.534 --> 21:08.069
I got two uniforms
posted out in back

21:08.257 --> 21:09.291
in case he decides
to rabbit.

21:09.582 --> 21:11.050
Castle, you sure you don't
want to stay in the car?

21:11.566 --> 21:12.667
We don't want
the curse to get you.

21:12.977 --> 21:14.097
I'm good to go.

21:14.102 --> 21:15.502
Okay. Ready?

21:15.736 --> 21:17.604
Go.

21:19.804 --> 21:20.924
NYPD.

21:21.038 --> 21:22.940
Norton Grimes.
Police. Show me your hands.

21:22.970 --> 21:24.338
Dog!

21:24.772 --> 21:26.740
Castle.
Nice doggy.
Good doggy.

21:26.774 --> 21:28.143
Castle, look o!
Ah! He got me! He got me!

21:28.178 --> 21:30.313
Castle, run!
Aah!

21:30.550 --> 21:33.852
Oh!

21:44.128 --> 21:46.529
Right this way, Mr. Grimes.
I could've been killed.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.203
But you weren't.

21:48.237 --> 21:49.905
Look,
you go through enough doors,

21:50.040 --> 21:51.942
at some point, you're gonna
find a dog on the other side.

21:51.952 --> 21:53.852
Yes, but it didn't happen
at some point, did it?

21:54.021 --> 21:54.656
It happened today...

21:54.775 --> 21:56.443
Right after I gazed into
the face of the mummy.

21:56.453 --> 21:58.634
Okay, I admit that the timing
was a little troublesome,

21:58.635 --> 22:00.570
but I promise you,
there is no curse.

22:00.604 --> 22:03.473
Beckett. Oh, hey.
It's Lanie.

22:03.507 --> 22:05.741
Okay.

22:08.130 --> 22:10.598
Right.

22:10.632 --> 22:13.067
Well,
what does that mean?

22:13.102 --> 22:15.003
What?
Are you sure?

22:15.037 --> 22:16.604
What?
Thanks.

22:16.638 --> 22:17.240
What? What'd she say?

22:17.441 --> 22:20.310
Nothing.
That was not nothing.

22:21.820 --> 22:23.253
Okay. Fine.

22:23.288 --> 22:26.189
The lab identified the substance
found on the gargoyle,

22:26.223 --> 22:29.125
and it was a combination
of sodium nitrate, iron oxide,

22:29.159 --> 22:30.762
decomposed hemp fibers
and... Tissue.

22:31.379 --> 22:33.680
I'm s--I'm sorry. What?

22:33.714 --> 22:35.816
Ancient human tissue.

22:35.850 --> 22:37.484
Mummified tissue?

22:37.519 --> 22:39.053
Like mummy flesh?

22:39.087 --> 22:40.488
Which means at some point,

22:40.522 --> 22:42.956
our killer came into contact
with the mummies

22:42.991 --> 22:44.958
and somehow transferred
the substance

22:44.992 --> 22:48.060
onto his or her clothing
before killing Medina.

22:48.094 --> 22:49.461
Or maybe...

22:49.496 --> 22:51.430
The mummy himself
has risen from the grave

22:51.464 --> 22:54.666
and is roaming New York
seeking vengeance.

22:54.701 --> 22:56.301
I'm kidding.

22:58.637 --> 23:00.672
Sort of.

23:00.706 --> 23:03.942
You know, if Medina was
trafficking drugs for Grimes

23:03.976 --> 23:05.911
through the sarcophagus,

23:05.945 --> 23:08.180
then maybe Grimes got
the substance on himself

23:08.214 --> 23:09.682
when he went to get
the drugs out.

23:14.765 --> 23:17.666
You mind flying solo
on this one

23:17.700 --> 23:20.202
while I head home
and change my clothes?

23:20.236 --> 23:21.871
I think I can manage.

23:21.906 --> 23:23.140
Hey, Castle.

23:24.475 --> 23:25.642
Watch out for the mummy.

23:26.264 --> 23:27.831
Really?

23:32.503 --> 23:34.572
Dog attack? Icing on the cake.

23:34.582 --> 23:36.282
Yeah, it was sort of like
a little bonus, wasn't it?

23:36.631 --> 23:39.169
You had to mess with the curse,
didn't you? Trying to be funny.

23:39.259 --> 23:40.396
You know what kind of hell
I'd catch if Castle got eaten

23:40.430 --> 23:41.565
in the line of duty?

23:41.575 --> 23:43.375
Don't tell me you really
believe in that stuff, sir.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.734
You know what I believe in,
Detective? There's no upside

23:45.907 --> 23:47.908
in screwing with things
that you can't explain.

23:48.143 --> 23:50.912
First year of homicide, right,
my partner tackles a suspect

23:50.946 --> 23:53.214
through the window
of a gypsy smoke shop.

23:53.248 --> 23:55.717
Owner's furious, threatens
all kinds of hexes on our houses

23:55.751 --> 23:57.652
if we don't personally go
and clean it up,

23:57.687 --> 24:00.088
and we tell her, "yeah,
take it up with the city."

24:00.123 --> 24:03.125
Two hours later, my partner
drops dead--heart attack.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.061
And you think
it was the hexes?

24:06.363 --> 24:09.432
No. The man ate bacon
with every meal.

24:09.467 --> 24:11.502
<i>But</i> the next morning,
I went over there,

24:11.536 --> 24:14.072
fixed that window,
and you know why?

24:14.106 --> 24:15.740
Because there's no upside

24:15.775 --> 24:16.310
in screwing with things
you can't explain?

24:16.320 --> 24:18.120
And don't you ever
forget it.

24:18.645 --> 24:20.446
Okay.

24:21.951 --> 24:23.653
You know, if our boy Grimes
saw the face of the mummy,

24:23.687 --> 24:24.956
it's likely he's cursed, too.

24:24.966 --> 24:26.666
Yeah, well, I'd rather suffer
a thousand curses

24:26.793 --> 24:28.595
than go up against Beckett
in the box.

24:28.738 --> 24:30.607
Lady, you got the wrong guy.

24:30.641 --> 24:33.576
I dropped outta the drug game
after I left the joint.

24:33.611 --> 24:34.978
That's funny,

24:35.012 --> 24:36.947
because I've got
surveillance photos

24:36.981 --> 24:40.284
showing you taking $10,000
in cash from Will Medina

24:40.318 --> 24:42.386
the day
that he was murdered.

24:42.420 --> 24:44.790
And given your rap sheet,

24:44.824 --> 24:46.658
I don't think
it would be too difficult

24:46.693 --> 24:47.862
to convince a jury
that you were involved.

24:47.872 --> 24:49.172
Okay, okay, <i>hold on.</i>

24:49.796 --> 24:53.199
I didn't murder anyone, and I
don't smuggle drugs anymore.

24:53.233 --> 24:55.534
I used my connections
to get a new gig--

24:55.569 --> 24:57.703
antiquities.

24:57.738 --> 24:59.138
Really?

24:59.172 --> 25:01.040
And why would Will Medina

25:01.074 --> 25:03.610
be buying antiquities
from you?

25:03.644 --> 25:05.712
Hmm. Not buying. Selling.

25:05.746 --> 25:08.014
I met him at a museum
fund-raiser last year.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.082
I gave him my card. I told him
I'm always interested

25:10.116 --> 25:12.050
in rare items
that may need a new home.

25:12.085 --> 25:13.919
He gave me a call
a few weeks later.

25:13.953 --> 25:15.321
He said he had
a box of Incan arrowheads

25:15.449 --> 25:17.885
that had just been sitting
on a shelf since the 1940s.

25:17.919 --> 25:20.325
I found him a buyer, and we
made a nice a little profit.

25:20.359 --> 25:23.127
And what were you buying
this time?

25:23.162 --> 25:25.496
A mummy.
A mummy?

25:26.814 --> 25:28.714
Who would want a mummy?

25:28.749 --> 25:31.451
A collector in Taipei.
So I stop by the museum.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.288
You know,
I thought he would say no.

25:33.322 --> 25:34.490
But he jumped
at the opportunity.

25:34.858 --> 25:37.225
Didn't he ever think that somebody
would notice this missing mummy?

25:37.260 --> 25:39.129
He said all the attention
was being paid

25:39.295 --> 25:42.430
to the mummy of the Mayan king,
not to slave girl number six.

25:42.465 --> 25:45.100
She was destined for the storage
room in the basement.

25:45.487 --> 25:47.489
So it'd be years before
anyone went looking for her.

25:47.523 --> 25:49.458
At which point,
her disappearance,

25:49.492 --> 25:52.094
it could never
be linked to him.

25:52.128 --> 25:53.798
And this $10,000
was a down payment?

25:53.808 --> 25:55.708
Of a quarter-million-dollar
payout.

25:55.865 --> 25:58.267
But then you showed up
and you took it back. Why?

25:58.301 --> 26:00.203
My client changed their mind.

26:00.237 --> 26:02.237
Guess they didn't like
the mummy.

26:02.272 --> 26:03.705
Why not?

26:03.739 --> 26:06.073
I don't know.
All I know is,

26:06.107 --> 26:08.074
they sent someone down to
the museum to take a look.

26:08.084 --> 26:08.904
Who did he send?

26:09.250 --> 26:11.250
I have no idea. I swear.

26:11.922 --> 26:14.490
Whatever they told him
turned my client off.

26:14.524 --> 26:16.157
Maybe the mummy
was too short.

26:16.191 --> 26:18.092
Maybe it didn't have
enough teeth.

26:18.126 --> 26:20.493
These private collectors,
they're very particular.

26:20.527 --> 26:22.627
They want
exactly what they want

26:22.661 --> 26:24.193
and nothing else.

26:24.227 --> 26:26.430
Selling mummies? How stupid
does he think we are?

26:26.605 --> 26:28.807
I know. The drug story is
a hell of a lot more plausible.

26:28.841 --> 26:30.810
But it just doesn't seem
to be Medina's style.

26:30.820 --> 26:31.920
There's one way to find out.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.376
Take samples from
this mummy's sarcophagus.

26:34.533 --> 26:36.533
If it tests positive for drugs,
Grimes is lying

26:36.978 --> 26:39.177
and most likely our murderer.
Great. Thanks.

26:46.249 --> 26:49.118
Hey.
What are you doing home?

26:49.152 --> 26:50.851
Facing my mortality.

26:52.037 --> 26:54.336
All this curse stuff
has got me thinking--

26:54.504 --> 26:55.469
if something were
to happen to me,

26:55.603 --> 26:56.733
you'd take good care
of Alexis, right?

26:56.743 --> 26:57.943
Oh, of course.

26:58.122 --> 26:59.286
Better than you took care
of me?

26:59.380 --> 27:01.712
Oh, please.
You turned out fine.

27:01.947 --> 27:04.146
Look, look, look, the chances
of this curse being real

27:04.180 --> 27:06.113
are almost nonexistent.
You know that.

27:07.242 --> 27:08.641
Maybe.

27:08.675 --> 27:11.610
What kind of father
would I be if I didn't do

27:11.644 --> 27:14.745
everything I could
to make sure I stick around?

27:14.779 --> 27:16.680
Well, then I think
maybe we should try

27:16.715 --> 27:19.116
to figure out a way to, uh,
reverse the curse--

27:19.150 --> 27:20.784
you know,
the mummy equivalent

27:20.819 --> 27:22.753
of my running around
the theater.

27:22.787 --> 27:25.155
Someone at the museum
must know that.

27:27.058 --> 27:29.894
You have become very wise
in your old age.

27:29.929 --> 27:32.731
Watch it, Buster.

27:32.765 --> 27:35.467
No, I'm afraid there's nothing
in the literature

27:35.502 --> 27:37.403
about reversing the curse.
Hey.

27:37.437 --> 27:39.438
Castle.
What are you doing here?

27:39.473 --> 27:41.408
Oh, nothing.
Just waiting for you.
Huh.

27:41.656 --> 27:43.057
Detectives, are you here

27:43.091 --> 27:44.391
to talk about reversing
the curse as well?

27:44.545 --> 27:47.013
No, I'm here to see
a man about a mummy.

27:47.023 --> 27:48.523
So no luck
with the curse, huh?

27:48.671 --> 27:49.571
Look on the bright side,
Castle.

27:49.745 --> 27:51.178
You die,
your book sales skyrocket.

27:51.312 --> 27:53.579
Great..What did Beckett mean,
"see a man about a mummy"?

27:53.757 --> 27:57.025
Which mummy?
The one Grimes said
Medina was trying to sell.

27:57.060 --> 27:58.994
Fill me in.
Spare no detail.

27:59.028 --> 28:01.461
Well, in some ancient cultures,
instead of burying--
fast-forward a little bit.

28:01.496 --> 28:04.698
Detective, this is a significant
archeological find.

28:04.732 --> 28:06.401
You can't just walk in here
and open it up.

28:06.411 --> 28:08.411
I've got a warrant
that says otherwise.

28:08.554 --> 28:11.222
This is preposterous.
Tell that to the drug dealer in my lockup

28:11.418 --> 28:13.719
who was doing business
with your associate curator.

28:14.054 --> 28:17.788
Please. I just have to reiterate
how fragile these mummies are.

28:18.123 --> 28:20.490
They should only be handled
in a controlled environment.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.925
Don't worry. It's just
a simple swab test.

28:22.959 --> 28:25.327
I promise.
I won't damage anything.

28:34.069 --> 28:36.603
Oh, my God. It's gone.

28:37.483 --> 28:41.686
I'm not saying
I believe...

28:41.720 --> 28:43.621
But where's the mummy?

28:52.707 --> 28:54.641
C.S.U. field test shows

28:54.675 --> 28:55.843
that there's no drug residue
inside the sarcophagus.

28:56.351 --> 28:57.652
And all the other mummies
are accounted for.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.697
No drugs in them either.
Well, if it wasn't the drugs,

28:59.932 --> 29:01.534
then what's so special
about the missing mummy

29:01.544 --> 29:02.467
Well, maybe Grimes
was telling the truth.

29:02.468 --> 29:04.936
Maybe Medina was trying
to sell it.

29:05.056 --> 29:06.756
And then when Grimes
wouldn't buy it,

29:06.872 --> 29:07.939
he sold it to someone else?

29:07.949 --> 29:09.649
Except that one of
the researchers swears

29:09.822 --> 29:12.123
it was in its sarcophagus
the day after Medina was killed.

29:12.457 --> 29:13.559
Well, that could only mean
one thing.

29:13.693 --> 29:16.161
Please don't say that it's walking
among us seeking revenge.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.671
Okay. Don't say
I didn't warn you.

29:18.196 --> 29:19.562
This place is gigantic.

29:19.597 --> 29:22.164
They have over 30 million
specimens down here.

29:22.198 --> 29:24.366
We got a canine unit
coming in to help,

29:24.400 --> 29:27.669
but finding this mummy might be
like finding the lost ark.

29:27.703 --> 29:30.172
If it is even still here.
All right, have C.S.U.
Sweep the area,

29:30.206 --> 29:32.607
and see if they can get any
prints off of the sarcophagus.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.882
Whoever stole the mummy must
have left some evidence behind.

29:35.917 --> 29:38.084
Disaster!
P.R. Disaster!

29:38.119 --> 29:40.720
I only hope the press
doesn't hear about this.

29:40.754 --> 29:42.655
10 bucks says
he calls the press

29:42.689 --> 29:44.823
just as soon as we're out
the front door.

29:44.857 --> 29:47.258
Hey, you don't think he could've
orchestrated this whole thing

29:47.292 --> 29:49.360
just to generate interest
in the exhibit, do you?

29:49.394 --> 29:51.495
Murdered Medina just to
boost ticket sales? No.

29:51.529 --> 29:54.464
That would make this
"Scooby-Doo," and I'm not Velma.

29:54.498 --> 29:56.999
Velma? Are you kidding?
You're Daphne.

29:57.033 --> 29:59.434
You're hot, smart
but not aggressively brainy

29:59.469 --> 30:01.236
with long legs, short skirt--
stop.

30:01.270 --> 30:02.569
Fine.
Now.

30:02.604 --> 30:04.138
Got it.

30:06.298 --> 30:09.200
No. He didn't know anything
about how to reverse the curse.

30:09.234 --> 30:12.270
But I've decided, it's okay.
I was just overreacting.

30:12.305 --> 30:15.174
It's like you said, the chances
of there actually being a curse

30:15.208 --> 30:17.176
are--are virtually nonexistent.

30:21.582 --> 30:23.684
That was weird.
The elevator just stopped.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.388
Mother?

30:28.790 --> 30:30.892
Okay.

30:30.926 --> 30:33.161
No reason to panic.

30:34.897 --> 30:36.898
Small reason to panic.

30:38.935 --> 30:41.203
Hello?

30:49.113 --> 30:51.515
There is no curse.
There is no curse.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.984
There is no curse.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.055
What do I do? What do I do
if the elevator falls?

30:57.089 --> 31:00.024
Okay. I, um, I think I'm
supposed to jump in the air?

31:00.059 --> 31:02.861
No! Lay on the ground.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.366
Castle?

31:06.753 --> 31:08.588
What are you doing?

31:08.622 --> 31:11.925
That was--
that whole thing--

31:11.959 --> 31:14.294
then the light--the light,
and then the whole thing went--

31:14.328 --> 31:16.430
I thought--I thought
the elevator was gonna fall.

31:16.464 --> 31:18.432
That wasn't you, was it?
Because that wasn't funny.

31:18.466 --> 31:22.236
No, no. I'm not that cruel.
It's an old elevator.

31:22.270 --> 31:24.338
You know what? Let's get
maintenance up here

31:24.372 --> 31:27.841
and tell 'em not to let anyone
on here before it's fixed.

31:27.876 --> 31:29.808
Are you okay?
Yeah. No. Yeah. I'm--I'm--

31:29.843 --> 31:31.775
I'm gonna splash
some w-water on my face

31:31.809 --> 31:33.472
and then...
Throw up a little bit.

31:40.473 --> 31:42.973
Rogue archeologists,
Mayan death threats

31:43.008 --> 31:45.441
drug dealers claiming
to deal in antiquities

31:45.476 --> 31:46.875
and missing mummies?

31:47.410 --> 31:52.212
There's gotta be a story that
makes all of this make sense.

31:55.113 --> 31:56.847
What?

31:56.881 --> 31:58.215
Nothing.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.350
Castle.
If something
were to happen to me,

32:00.384 --> 32:03.285
I want you to watch out
for Alexis.

32:03.319 --> 32:04.685
She looks up to you,

32:04.719 --> 32:06.686
and if her boyfriends
get frisky,

32:06.720 --> 32:08.654
you can shoot them.

32:08.688 --> 32:10.188
Nothing's gonna happen
to you.

32:10.223 --> 32:13.459
But if it does...

32:15.427 --> 32:17.294
Okay.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.830
And would you also
go into my closet

32:20.864 --> 32:21.865
and get rid of my porn
collection before she finds it?

32:22.521 --> 32:24.389
Don't worry, bro.
I got you covered on that.

32:24.399 --> 32:25.419
We hit a home run

32:25.551 --> 32:27.052
with the prints
from the sarcophagus.

32:27.213 --> 32:28.082
One popped
that doesn't belong

32:28.211 --> 32:29.779
to anyone
who works at the museum.

32:30.113 --> 32:32.081
But according to
the background check,

32:32.115 --> 32:33.982
he does work
at 1127 Avenue of the Americas--

32:34.017 --> 32:36.484
the address on Medina's calendar.
At a company called Bio inc.

32:36.519 --> 32:40.385
And here is the best part--
his name is Charles Taylor.

32:40.883 --> 32:41.884
C.T.?

32:41.894 --> 32:43.194
Spoke to the guy
two days ago,

32:43.291 --> 32:45.291
and he insisted
he'd never met Medina.

32:45.326 --> 32:46.959
Lied right to my face.

32:46.993 --> 32:50.194
No, no. I didn't lie. I swear to
you, I don't know Will Medina.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.296
You didn't see him
two days ago at 5:30?

32:52.331 --> 32:55.066
No. You got the wrong guy.
But you admit

32:55.100 --> 32:56.305
that you were in the basement
of the New York History Museum.

32:57.900 --> 32:58.820
No.

32:59.133 --> 33:01.701
Charles, we have your
fingerprints on a sarcophagus.

33:01.736 --> 33:02.936
So you can either start
telling us the truth now

33:02.971 --> 33:05.006
or after spending an afternoon
in the holding cell

33:05.040 --> 33:07.108
entertaining a meth addict
through the violent phase

33:07.143 --> 33:07.845
of his withdrawal.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.021
I might have been down there.

33:11.431 --> 33:13.499
When?

33:13.533 --> 33:15.467
Okay. Holding cell it is.

33:15.502 --> 33:18.571
Five days ago.

33:19.161 --> 33:20.096
And Medina?

33:20.254 --> 33:21.221
Look, I heard he was dead.

33:21.255 --> 33:22.555
I didn't want to get
mixed up in that.

33:23.638 --> 33:25.139
I-I was only sent there
to check out the mummy.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.300
The mummy?

33:26.371 --> 33:29.039
Yeah. I was sent by a private
collector to examine it.

33:29.713 --> 33:31.114
Grimes was
telling the truth.

33:31.533 --> 33:32.801
Medina was trying
to sell the mummy.

33:32.835 --> 33:33.736
This is getting good.

33:33.860 --> 33:35.095
This collector,
where is he from?

33:35.105 --> 33:37.505
Taipei. I've done
testing for him before--

33:37.817 --> 33:40.385
uh, uh, hominid skulls,
a mammoth tusk.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.254
He asked me
to carbon date them,

33:42.288 --> 33:43.257
wanted me to make sure
it was real.

33:43.267 --> 33:44.667
And was it?

33:45.897 --> 33:47.999
It's complicated.
We'll try and keep up.

33:48.170 --> 33:51.139
As soon as an organism dies,
it stops taking in new carbon.

33:51.173 --> 33:53.107
Specifically,
we focus on carbon 14,

33:53.142 --> 33:55.310
which starts to decay
in the body as soon as it dies,

33:55.344 --> 33:57.412
and by examining the rate
of decay, we can actually date

33:57.446 --> 33:59.248
the age of the dead organism
with incredible accuracy.

33:59.433 --> 34:02.335
When I tested the mummy, I took
samples from the sarcophagus

34:02.369 --> 34:04.204
the cloth the mummy was wrapped
in and a small piece of bone,

34:04.426 --> 34:06.495
and then I ran them through
a mass spectrometer and...

34:06.626 --> 34:09.761
That's when things got weird.

34:10.938 --> 34:12.540
Define "weird."

34:12.574 --> 34:14.609
The samples from
the sarcophagus and the cloth

34:14.643 --> 34:16.511
dated at over 2,000 years old,

34:16.545 --> 34:19.580
but the piece of bone...
Was too young to date,

34:19.614 --> 34:22.549
meaning that it was
less than 500 years old.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.650
How much less?
I have no idea.

34:24.685 --> 34:27.053
500 years is as low
as the test goes.

34:27.087 --> 34:29.554
Are you saying that the mummy
Medina was trying to sell

34:29.589 --> 34:30.989
was a fake?

34:31.024 --> 34:33.391
Well, all I know is that
there was a discrepancy

34:33.426 --> 34:35.427
and I called him
and I told him that,

34:35.460 --> 34:36.860
and he didn't believe me.

34:36.895 --> 34:39.897
He insisted on coming
to the office to see me...

34:39.931 --> 34:42.099
The night that he died.

34:42.132 --> 34:43.132
Beckett.

34:43.167 --> 34:45.402
Uniforms
just found your mummy.

34:45.436 --> 34:48.337
Where?
In a dark corner
of the museum basement.

34:48.371 --> 34:50.440
Someone was doing their best to
make sure it was never found.

34:50.449 --> 34:52.050
Medina's buyer
rejected the mummy

34:52.188 --> 34:53.621
because it wasn't real.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.989
And then when Medina started
asking questions, he was killed.

34:56.250 --> 34:59.185
And now someone's trying
to make it disappear?

34:59.219 --> 35:01.387
I think we need to take
a closer look at that mummy.

35:01.573 --> 35:03.506
Your carbon dater
was right.

35:03.541 --> 35:06.142
This girl's body is definitely
less than 500-years dead.

35:06.277 --> 35:07.677
How much less?

35:08.211 --> 35:10.979
She died four months ago.
If she's been dead for four months,

35:11.013 --> 35:12.049
why does she look
just like the other mummies?

35:12.059 --> 35:14.859
Because whoever mummified her
knew what they were doing.

35:15.383 --> 35:16.984
Her blood's been drained,
there's an incision

35:17.018 --> 35:19.553
on her left side, which her
killer used to remove her organs

35:19.588 --> 35:21.489
before starting
the desiccation process.

35:21.499 --> 35:22.719
How did she die?

35:22.795 --> 35:25.497
Blunt force trauma. Someone
hit her in the back of the head.

35:25.531 --> 35:26.402
She never saw it coming.

35:26.412 --> 35:27.912
And then do you have
any idea who she is?

35:28.632 --> 35:31.371
No, and I was unable to get
a usable fingerprint.

35:31.405 --> 35:34.245
We don't need them.

35:34.279 --> 35:36.081
She died four months ago.

35:36.115 --> 35:38.387
I know exactly who this is.

35:48.409 --> 35:49.676
Dental records confirm

35:49.710 --> 35:53.012
that the body is Nicole Graham,
the first victim of the curse.

35:53.183 --> 35:54.853
I thought this girl was killed
by an animal in the jungle.

35:54.863 --> 35:56.986
Turns out they never
actually found the body.

35:56.987 --> 35:59.355
Just her bloody clothes
and a piece of scalp.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.760
It seemed obvious to the Mexican
authorities what had happened.

36:01.937 --> 36:03.805
Instead somebody killed her
and turned her into a mummy?

36:03.815 --> 36:05.215
Hell of a way
to get rid of a body--

36:05.480 --> 36:07.715
hide it in plain sight, ship it
out with the other artifacts.

36:07.869 --> 36:09.103
And no one would've ever
found out

36:09.292 --> 36:11.460
if Medina hadn't decided
to sell the wrong mummy.

36:11.494 --> 36:13.895
When the collector refused it,
Medina must have decided

36:13.930 --> 36:16.765
to take a closer look.
And then that suspicion
must have tipped off our killer,

36:16.799 --> 36:20.102
who had to murder Medina in
order to keep the secret safe.

36:20.112 --> 36:22.012
It makes sense,
but who's our killer?

36:22.171 --> 36:24.907
The only person with the skill
to mummify a body.

36:26.843 --> 36:28.443
What's going on?

36:28.478 --> 36:29.945
Four words--

36:29.979 --> 36:32.748
eat, pray, love, kill.

36:33.964 --> 36:34.998
Little friendly advice--

36:35.152 --> 36:37.787
next time you kill someone,
skip the part

36:37.821 --> 36:38.922
where you prove only you
could've covered it up.

36:39.128 --> 36:40.797
Kill someone?
What are you talking about?

36:40.807 --> 36:42.107
We're talking about
Nicole Graham.

36:42.131 --> 36:43.432
You killed her in Mexico,

36:43.525 --> 36:45.826
and then you mummified her body
in order to cover it up.

36:45.861 --> 36:48.395
What? No, Nicole was killed
in a Jaguar attack.

36:48.430 --> 36:50.798
Except they never found her body.
But we did.

36:51.071 --> 36:54.240
And so did Medina when he discovered
the discrepancy in the carbon dating.

36:54.443 --> 36:56.479
And that's when you knew
that you had to kill him.

36:57.847 --> 36:58.647
That's insane.

36:58.743 --> 37:00.310
What happened, Rachel?

37:00.344 --> 37:03.246
Did you find her in the jungle
making time with your man?

37:03.280 --> 37:06.416
A little "Girls Gone Wild"
jealousy turned deadly?

37:06.451 --> 37:08.352
No, Nicole and I
were friends.

37:08.386 --> 37:11.289
And whoever told you she was
sleeping with Will was lying.

37:11.323 --> 37:13.825
Sure, she had a crush on him.
Okay? We all did.

37:13.859 --> 37:15.761
But she backed off
when she realized

37:15.795 --> 37:17.796
that Will
was interested in me.

37:17.831 --> 37:19.598
But Stanford...

37:19.633 --> 37:21.000
Stanford.

37:21.034 --> 37:22.769
Stanford was the one
who was jealous.

37:23.930 --> 37:25.131
Ask any of the women
down there.

37:25.566 --> 37:27.668
He had a thing for Nicole ever
since she joined the program.

37:28.327 --> 37:29.995
You'd always see him
standing around watching her.

37:30.073 --> 37:31.607
It was creepy.
You were the expert, Rachel.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.419
You were the only one
who knew how to do it.

37:34.429 --> 37:35.629
No, I wasn't.

37:36.281 --> 37:37.715
Everything I know
about mummification,

37:37.947 --> 37:39.516
I learned
from Stanford Raynes.

37:39.724 --> 37:42.359
Look, Detective, mummifying
a body is hands-on process.

37:42.607 --> 37:43.474
I promise you,

37:43.645 --> 37:45.779
whoever did that to Nicole
left behind some D.N.A.

37:46.114 --> 37:48.348
I'm happy to provide
a sample.

37:48.383 --> 37:50.951
Why don't you see if Stanford
wants to do the same?

37:54.119 --> 37:55.154
Stanford Raynes.

37:55.423 --> 37:56.757
Yes.

37:56.791 --> 37:58.726
You're under arrest for
the murder of Nicole Graham.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.597
And don't forget Will Medina.
You had to kill him, too,

38:01.631 --> 38:03.231
when you caught him
sniffing around her mummy.

38:03.506 --> 38:05.675
Only way to protect your secret.
You can't be serious.

38:05.736 --> 38:08.172
Serious enough to get
a warrant for your D.N.A.

38:09.777 --> 38:11.145
This is the part
where you say,

38:11.274 --> 38:12.708
"and I would've gotten away
with it, too,

38:12.917 --> 38:14.651
if it weren't
for you meddling kids."

38:20.999 --> 38:23.833
Is he actually...
Running away?

38:23.867 --> 38:26.431
Yeah,
it's primal instinct--

38:26.465 --> 38:27.931
fight or flight.

38:27.965 --> 38:29.729
Should we run after him?

38:29.764 --> 38:31.495
Eh, no need.

38:40.233 --> 38:42.067
Oh! Ohh!

38:49.007 --> 38:51.808
Ohh. Oh.

38:51.842 --> 38:53.176
Ohh.

38:53.281 --> 38:54.916
Still say
there's no curse?

38:55.450 --> 38:57.885
Ohh.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.686
Ruh-roh.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.649
Once Stanford
got out of surgery,

39:02.749 --> 39:03.883
he confessed to everything--

39:04.034 --> 39:05.968
how he lured Nicole
into the burial chamber

39:06.003 --> 39:08.971
and how they fought when she
refused to celebrate with him.

39:09.006 --> 39:11.174
So what happened to the mummy
he swapped for Nicole's body?

39:11.208 --> 39:13.944
The body was so fragile
that all Stanford had to do

39:13.978 --> 39:16.446
was strip off the wrapping
and stomp it into dust.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.281
And then he rewrapped
Nicole's body,

39:18.316 --> 39:19.951
stuffed it in the sarcophagus,
sealed it up tight,

39:20.146 --> 39:22.414
and by the time it got
to the U.S. months later,

39:22.448 --> 39:24.051
mummification process
was complete.

39:24.061 --> 39:26.661
And when Stanford decided
to kill Medina,

39:26.864 --> 39:27.832
he just used
one of the pry bars

39:27.988 --> 39:29.323
from the museum
to tip the gargoyle

39:29.404 --> 39:32.039
and hoped that Medina's death
would be blamed on the curse.

39:32.049 --> 39:33.649
Three members
of the expedition dead,

39:33.987 --> 39:36.855
one on the way to jail--sounds
like the curse is real to me.

39:37.930 --> 39:40.030
Speaking of which...

39:41.182 --> 39:44.084
I have a deal to propose.

39:44.878 --> 39:46.278
I spoke to the D.A.,

39:46.312 --> 39:48.081
and he's agreed to drop
the felony threat charges

39:48.115 --> 39:49.616
based on your cooperation.

39:50.721 --> 39:55.525
What kind of cooperation?

39:56.860 --> 39:59.662
Tell him how to reverse
the curse.

39:59.696 --> 40:01.530
Why should I?

40:01.565 --> 40:03.566
Because thanks to us,
Mr. Bentley has agreed

40:03.600 --> 40:05.401
to send the entire collection

40:05.435 --> 40:07.704
back to the Mexican Museum
after the exhibit ends.

40:08.768 --> 40:10.136
And why would he agree
to that?

40:10.793 --> 40:11.328
Well, let's just say
he's got

40:11.463 --> 40:13.431
a little public relations
problem right now,

40:13.715 --> 40:17.085
and he could use all
the good publicity he can get.

40:26.302 --> 40:27.404
That's all I have to do?

40:27.438 --> 40:28.405
Mm-hmm.

40:29.939 --> 40:31.107
And one more thing.
Hmm?

40:31.691 --> 40:33.491
I wouldn't say no
to a ride to the airport.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.208
Let's go.

40:39.029 --> 40:40.230
You're in a good mood.

40:40.265 --> 40:43.101
The curse has officially
been lifted.

40:43.135 --> 40:45.536
How'd you manage that?
You don't want to know.

40:45.571 --> 40:47.706
But I tempted fate
all the way home

40:47.937 --> 40:49.404
just to make sure.
Jaywalking?

40:49.438 --> 40:52.405
Mm-hmm.
Even walked under a ladder.

40:52.440 --> 40:54.406
What murderous experiments are
you performing on tomatoes now--

40:54.441 --> 40:56.809
stabbing, filleting?
Dicing <i>for a salad.</i>

40:58.067 --> 40:59.868
Want to help?

41:00.983 --> 41:02.118
I would love to.

41:02.830 --> 41:04.798
So I was thinking,
maybe this weekend

41:04.832 --> 41:06.599
we could go to the museum.

41:06.633 --> 41:08.200
It's been a while.

41:08.234 --> 41:10.235
Yeah.

41:10.269 --> 41:11.537
How about the zoo?

41:12.152 --> 41:12.919
That sounds great.

41:12.942 --> 41:15.710
Thank you.

41:17.547 --> 41:21.015
What's the difference
between cursed and clumsy?

41:21.049 --> 41:21.750
I'll get a band-aid.

41:21.784 --> 41:23.985
Get two.
