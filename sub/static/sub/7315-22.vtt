WEBVTT

00:08.541 --> 00:11.643
(panting)

00:15.548 --> 00:17.516
(camera shutter clicking)

00:36.403 --> 00:38.470
(indistinct shouting)

00:40.607 --> 00:42.608
(gunfire)

00:48.481 --> 00:51.150
Man:
Marine, put the camera down.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.123
Man:
This is the photo taken
last September

01:31.125 --> 01:33.158
By marine photojournalist
staff sergeant martin roe.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.360
He's known as shooter.
He was assigned

01:35.362 --> 01:38.864
To a joint army/marine
task force in farah province.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.866
I saw the photo in the <i>post.</i>

01:40.868 --> 01:42.634
How did it get out?
Roe gave it

01:42.636 --> 01:44.369
To the task force commander.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.105
Who gave it to the press,

01:46.107 --> 01:47.706
Well, that's a matter
of conjecture,

01:47.708 --> 01:50.709
And it will be an issue
in the court-martial.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.144
A lot
of army people

01:52.146 --> 01:54.179
Have accused roe
of being the leak.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.148
(knocking)
come in.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.884
Hey, chad.
You ready to sell me
that old pickup of yours?

01:58.886 --> 02:01.453
Not a chance. What's up?
Need your help.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.256
The man in this picture, army
first lieutenant michael waters,

02:04.258 --> 02:07.226
Is being court-martialed for the
death of the afghan villager.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.595
It's hard not to have heard
about it in washington.
The lieutenant claims

02:09.597 --> 02:11.263
That the villager
was a taliban terrorist

02:11.265 --> 02:13.232
And it was a justified shooting.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.200
Sergeant roe,
who took the picture

02:15.202 --> 02:17.202
And is presently
under my command,

02:17.204 --> 02:19.471
Claims it was
a revenge execution.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.572
He said, he said.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.875
Court-martial
started last week.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.310
Staff sergeant roe was due
to testify on Friday,

02:25.312 --> 02:28.180
But he didn't show.
They can't find him.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.149
So they recessed until tomorrow.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.283
When's the last
time you saw him?

02:31.285 --> 02:32.484
Four days ago.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.752
He's the key witness,

02:33.754 --> 02:36.421
And he was looking forward
to testifying.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.489
They don't have much

02:37.491 --> 02:38.790
Of a case without him.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.859
Okay. Let's get on it.

02:41.928 --> 02:44.763
Gentlemen,
I've already heard

02:44.765 --> 02:47.166
From secnav and the commandant
of the marine corps.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.168
Army's pissed

02:49.170 --> 02:52.437
That a photo taken by a marine
was leaked to the press.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.339
It's making them
look bad.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.208
Tread lightly.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.483
Tony:
You're late.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.219
I had something to do.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.321
Boss isn't in yet?

03:09.323 --> 03:12.191
Uh, he beat us all in.
He's with the director.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.726
Is our little timmy trying
to grow a beard? Mmm.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.229
Going for the
bad-boy look?
Cut it out, tony.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.330
I think beards are sexy.

03:18.965 --> 03:21.400
Can an ncis agent grow one?

03:21.402 --> 03:23.235
Not you.
I'm not growing a beard.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.237
My face started itching
on Friday, and I went

03:25.239 --> 03:26.572
To see a dermatologist
on the way home.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.308
It got worse
over the weekend,

03:29.310 --> 03:31.777
And I went back
to the doctor's this morning.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.346
She told me I have
pseudofolliculitis.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.715
Isn't that a <i>mary poppins</i> song?
It's not a big deal,
apparently.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.950
She gave me something
for the itch

03:37.952 --> 03:39.451
And told me
not to shave for a week.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.253
You get a note
from the doctor for gibbs?

03:41.255 --> 03:43.222
Bishop:
Ooh, hmm. Here he comes.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.290
Who's he with?
Ah, it's commander hendricks.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.526
Public affairs officer
on the navy yard.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.827
Mcgee, put up
the service records

03:48.829 --> 03:50.229
Of staff sergeant martin roe.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.296
R-o-e.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.831
Hey, commander.
Dinozzo.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.301
That's the marine photographer

03:56.303 --> 03:59.238
That took <i>the</i> picture.
Gibbs:
He's missing.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.872
He was due at
the army court-martial Friday.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.243
Hendricks:
Called him all weekend.
Left messages. Got no response.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.311
Even checked out his apartment.
Do you have
his cell phone number?

04:06.313 --> 04:08.313
I could do a quick
location trace.
Yeah.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.015
Talk to the family?
Yes. His parents in flagstaff.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.885
Anything you can tell us,
like friends or enemies?

04:13.887 --> 04:15.954
Roe's only been back
from afghanistan since
the first of the year.

04:15.956 --> 04:22.995
What's he working on now?
A piece on homeless military
veterans in the dc area.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.596
Well, roe's phone
is either turned off

04:24.598 --> 04:26.632
Or his battery's dead.
Dinozzo, bishop, get a warrant.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.333
Check out sergeant roe's
residence.

04:28.335 --> 04:30.002
I want to talk
to the person who benefits most

04:30.004 --> 04:31.536
From staff sergeant roe's
disappearance,

04:31.538 --> 04:33.372
Army lieutenant waters.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.539
Keep me in the loop.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.756
Appreciate you coming in,
lieutenant waters.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.392
Yeah, not a problem.
I have nowhere else to be today.

04:53.394 --> 04:56.428
Maybe you didn't hear-- my
court-martial was put on hold.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.331
Uh, special agent gibbs,

04:59.333 --> 05:02.067
I'm major huggins,
lieutenant waters' jag counsel.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.435
I thought I should
accompany him.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.670
We're just not sure

05:04.672 --> 05:07.072
Why ncis wants to talk
with my client.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.508
Staff sergeant roe is missing,
and we're trying to find him.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.576
We're talking to his coworkers,
people who know him.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.578
Obviously, I have
to interview the person who...

05:13.580 --> 05:15.614
Stands to gain the most
from his absence.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.015
What are you saying?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.650
Staff sergeant roe
not testifying

05:18.652 --> 05:20.852
Has a big impact
on your trial.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.487
Are you accusing me
of having something to do

05:22.489 --> 05:24.423
With that lying dirtbag
not showing up?

05:24.425 --> 05:25.557
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.392
It says "interrogation"
on the outside

05:27.394 --> 05:28.927
Of that door,
special agent gibbs.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.862
That's a little
intimidating.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.798
And, obviously, this is sounding

05:32.800 --> 05:34.499
Like something more
than just an interview.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.634
I've got nothing to hide.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.102
I've been restricted
to post at fort mcnair

05:37.104 --> 05:39.104
Since I was brought back
from afghanistan.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.772
Check the logs.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.940
We will.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.544
I think we are done here.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.413
You know, I got a theory

05:48.415 --> 05:51.350
He went into hiding
so he wouldn't have

05:51.352 --> 05:53.352
To tell his lies in court
and perjure himself.

05:55.755 --> 05:56.988
What?

05:56.990 --> 05:59.424
Roe shot a photograph.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.892
You shot a villager.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.960
Hopefully a jury
will decide

06:01.962 --> 06:04.096
If it was justified.
Hopefully.

06:04.098 --> 06:07.099
I know what this
is all about.

06:07.101 --> 06:09.401
Look at his haircut.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.403
You a marine, gibbs?

06:12.638 --> 06:15.674
This is one dumb jarhead
covering for another.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.378
(cell phone chimes)

06:36.729 --> 06:40.799
Sergeant roe is a really
good photographer.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.471
I just can't
get used to this.

06:46.473 --> 06:49.107
It creeps me out.
What?

06:49.109 --> 06:52.110
Just... Going through people's
stuff without their permission.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.913
It's an invasion of privacy.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.685
It's my favorite part
of the job. I love it.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.521
You find out
people's secrets.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.157
And I have discovered
that the smallest things

07:05.159 --> 07:07.526
Can tell you a whole lot.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.161
Like what?
Who they
really are.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.562
On the surface,
our staff sergeant's

07:10.564 --> 07:12.564
A 28-year-old marine
combat photographer

07:12.566 --> 07:14.866
Who goes into battle
armed with just a camera.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.668
But, below
the surface...

07:16.670 --> 07:19.938
He's a sentimental romantic.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.007
How do you know that?

07:22.009 --> 07:24.676
Last month's cable bill. Look
at those pay-per-view choices.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.911
<i>The vow?</i>

07:25.913 --> 07:27.512
<i>The notebook?</i>

07:27.514 --> 07:29.748
<i>Sabrina?</i> Both versions?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.183
I mean,
I understand the bogey one,

07:31.185 --> 07:33.885
But the harrison ford one?
Terrible.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.921
All right.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.522
I'll go through
the recent pictures

07:37.524 --> 07:39.024
On his camera.
No.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.692
We'll do that
when we get back to the office.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.060
I want you to go
into the bathroom.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.096
That's where
the darkest secrets lurk.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.737
It's kind of nice getting out of
the office and into the field,

07:52.739 --> 07:55.207
Isn't it?
Yeah.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.476
Wait till you do
your first 24-hour,

07:57.478 --> 07:58.710
All-night surveillance.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.179
Bishop:
Mcgee already warned me.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.684
I think I found something.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.119
Roe had at least one enemy.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.955
"we know where you live.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.791
Wise up and shut up."

08:12.793 --> 08:14.726
No signature.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.162
Maybe abby can
pull prints.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.497
Bishop?

08:18.499 --> 08:21.533
Bishop, can you hear me?

08:21.535 --> 08:24.569
I found something, too.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.673
Was roe an addict?

08:46.259 --> 08:49.661
Those the recent pictures
from roe's camera?
Yeah.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.664
There are some really poignant
shots of homeless people.

08:52.666 --> 08:56.001
One guy with a dog
is in a lot of them.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.302
Mcgee,

08:57.304 --> 08:59.237
What's taking so long
with the timeline?

08:59.239 --> 09:01.806
All those pictures were
time- and date-stamped.
Yeah, they also

09:01.808 --> 09:04.209
Have a gps location.
I'm laying out pictures on a map

09:04.211 --> 09:05.844
To show where they were taken.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.046
I am almost... Done.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.082
The final picture
was taken last Wednesday.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.884
Tony:
Looks like most of 'em
were in a two-block area.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.152
Yeah, near here.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.987
Just outside
the navy yard.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.822
Let's go for a walk.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.058
Maybe we can find someone
who's seen sergeant roe.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.564
Said you had something, abbs.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.198
Afternoon,
ms. Sciuto.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
Hey, commander.
Find a fingerprint on that note?

09:29.202 --> 09:31.169
Actually, I found two.
They're thumbprints.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.737
They both belong
to sergeant roe,

09:32.739 --> 09:34.639
But that's not what I wanted
to show you.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.908
I found traces of fentanyl

09:36.910 --> 09:39.110
And heroin on the spoon.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.681
It's a cocktail commonly called
china white on the street.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.049
I found
the same drug

09:44.051 --> 09:46.184
In the reservoir
of the syringe.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.787
And I found sergeant
roe's dna on the needle.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.055
I don't believe it.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.691
No way that kid
was on drugs.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.759
Maybe you didn't
know him that well.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.188
(indistinct chatter)

10:24.957 --> 10:26.191
(horn honks)

10:26.193 --> 10:27.626
Whew. Any luck?

10:27.628 --> 10:29.060
No.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.895
Me, neither.

10:30.897 --> 10:35.166
It's hard to believe we work
only a few blocks from here.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.168
Well, hold on.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.170
This picture
was taken right here.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.373
Several of 'em
were taken over there.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.809
And according
to the gps,

10:44.811 --> 10:47.912
This picture was taken
from inside this building.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.181
(rattling)

10:50.183 --> 10:54.219
All right, well, let's see
if we can find a way in.

11:08.434 --> 11:12.070
Toto, we're not in kansas
anymore.

11:13.939 --> 11:17.208
Oh. What's that stench?

11:17.210 --> 11:20.178
Ugh!

11:22.314 --> 11:26.918
What a sad existence.

11:31.123 --> 11:34.759
Tony, there's a lot
of people living in here.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.394
Tony:
They're dying here, too.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.336
(sighs)

11:49.475 --> 11:51.076
(siren whoops)

11:51.078 --> 11:55.280
I've had a problem with drug
addicts and the homeless.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.282
I board it up,
they break in.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.118
It's a losing battle.
When's the last time
you were inside?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.953
I don't know.
Couple weeks ago.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.122
And now there's a dead body?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.725
Never be able
to sell this place.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.501
Well, this is definitely
staff sergeant roe.

12:16.503 --> 12:20.338
When, duck?
Educated guess,
four or five days.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.006
Preliminary cause
an overdose?

12:22.008 --> 12:24.075
Yeah, well, this dried foam

12:24.077 --> 12:27.011
Around his mouth is consistent
with that conclusion.

12:27.013 --> 12:30.215
Oh, we'll know more when
we do a full tox screen.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.417
I don't think
he's been using long.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.487
No previous needle marks
or infections.

12:35.489 --> 12:38.456
(sighs)
something wrong, boss?

12:38.458 --> 12:41.459
It's just not where
I thought this one was going.

12:50.169 --> 12:52.370
Got a call in the car.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.140
With the key witness dead,
it looks like

12:55.142 --> 12:56.474
The charges are going
to be dropped.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.976
Court-martial proceedings

12:57.978 --> 12:59.410
Against lieutenant waters
will be dismissed.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.112
How convenient.
Staff sergeant roe's

13:01.114 --> 13:02.413
Family been notified?
Yeah.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.015
Caco team's on it.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.450
(phone ringing)

13:05.452 --> 13:07.185
Yeah, it's gibbs.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.995
Can I help you, director?

13:16.997 --> 13:19.798
Gibbs:
On my way down, duck.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.466
Hey, ducky and abby
have something.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.967
Want to come along?

13:22.969 --> 13:24.435
Sure.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.505
Looking a little
scruffy, mcgee.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.482
That was quick.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.150
Always good to
see you, director.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.552
What did you
two find out?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.020
Cause of death,
as suspected,

13:42.022 --> 13:43.488
Was a drug overdose.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.490
It's a combination
of heroin and fentanyl,

13:45.492 --> 13:48.126
Same proportions as found
on the needle in his apartment.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.061
However, that's not why
we called you down here.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.231
After the autopsy was finished,
but before I put the body away,

13:53.233 --> 13:56.534
I noticed a slight abrasion
on the sergeant's nose.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.936
Like one would get

13:57.938 --> 14:00.538
From vigorously rubbing
with a handkerchief.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.040
Let me show you.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.409
Just tell us what
you know, duck.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.978
I-I swabbed
the anterior nasal passage

14:06.980 --> 14:09.147
And sent the sample up to abby.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.083
I found residue of high
concentrations of chloroform.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.852
Ducky:
Our conclusion is
that the sergeant

14:13.854 --> 14:15.887
Was incapacitated
by the chloroform

14:15.889 --> 14:20.558
Before a lethal injection
of heroin was administered

14:20.560 --> 14:22.861
To his unconscious body.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.562
Ergo...

14:24.564 --> 14:27.532
Sergeant roe
was murdered.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.077
Staff sergeant roe is no longer
a missing person,

14:39.079 --> 14:40.979
Because he's dead.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.580
It's a murder.
Well, waters,
the army lieutenant,

14:42.582 --> 14:44.916
Has got to be at the top
of the suspect list.

14:44.918 --> 14:48.019
He was gunning for roe.
But he was confined
to the base.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.988
Yeah, but his assault team
vehemently backs his story

14:49.990 --> 14:52.090
And blames roe
for his court-martial.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.559
Well, check it out, mcgee.
Tony: Photos we found
on roe's camera show

14:54.561 --> 14:57.428
He was digging deep
into the street subculture.
We found his body

14:57.430 --> 14:58.963
In a building where
the homeless squat.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.331
Put up those pictures.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.105
Tony (sighs):
They're interesting.

15:07.107 --> 15:10.241
Maybe roe stuck his nose or
his camera in the wrong place.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.943
Gibbs:
The guy with the dog's
in a lot of them.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.544
Tony:
Yeah, we noticed that.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.113
Bishop, blow up that one.

15:16.949 --> 15:19.083
Move in on the tattoo.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.921
The guy was navy.
Tony:
Roe's c.O. Said

15:22.923 --> 15:26.024
That he was working on a story
about homeless veterans.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.992
Roe spent a lot of time with
this guy. Find out who he is.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.127
I know who he is.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.929
That's dave and blue.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.531
Dave who?
Just dave.
He doesn't have a last name.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.067
Got to have a last name.
He's a dog.
Dogs don't have last names.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.703
The guy's name is blue?
Yeah. That's what they call him.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.705
I see him and dave
by the off-ramp almost

15:40.707 --> 15:44.108
Every single morning. I gave
blue that shirt last christmas.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.377
And I bring dave dog food
a couple times a week.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.413
Run facial recognition
of navy veterans.

15:50.215 --> 15:54.385
You know, I actually haven't
seen blue in the last few days.

15:54.387 --> 15:58.122
Did he do something?
Is he in trouble?

16:00.492 --> 16:02.026
I don't know.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.532
Uh-uh.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.634
Come on.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.003
Bishop:
Hi. Excuse me.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.472
Ncis. Have you...?

16:17.743 --> 16:19.978
(sighs)

16:19.980 --> 16:22.046
Tell me you got something.
No.

16:22.048 --> 16:24.048
I mean, I can understand

16:24.050 --> 16:25.984
If people don't recognize
the picture of sergeant roe.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.685
But abby said

16:27.687 --> 16:29.754
She's seen blue and his dog
around here for years.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.556
Somebody must have seen them.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.725
Trust me, they have,
but they're not gonna tell us.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.059
We're the enemy.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.227
We're flashing badges,

16:36.229 --> 16:38.329
We got a gun,
we're asking questions.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.098
We're what they fear.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.166
Authority.
So what do we do?

16:42.168 --> 16:44.102
Blend in.
Go undercover?
Oh.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.137
It won't work. We've been
all over the neighborhood.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.505
I'm very good at disguises.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.440
No, we won't pull it off.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.076
You know, you're right, probie.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.245
But I think
I know one agent

16:54.247 --> 16:56.014
Who might be able to.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.250
He's been looking a little...
Scruffy lately.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.719
Vance:
<i>Major.</i>

17:03.756 --> 17:05.690
I have got a problem,
director vance.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.592
What's the problem?

17:07.594 --> 17:10.762
I received a call
from your agent gibbs.

17:10.764 --> 17:13.064
He wants me to bring
lieutenant waters back in.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.600
There's no point.
He's already been interviewed.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.802
Yesterday, we were investigating
a missing marine.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.338
Today, we're investigating
his murder.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.374
And I thought we made it clear
to agent gibbs.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.043
Waters couldn't
be involved.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.345
He's been restricted
to post at fort mcnair.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.148
We found a threatening letter in
staff sergeant roe's apartment.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.084
It could have come from waters,
or a member of his team.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.385
They've been
very loyal to him.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.821
For good reason.
The man is a hero.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.090
Three tours of duty
in a war zone.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.059
Multiple decorations,
including two purple hearts.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.795
He was in that afghan village
to flush out a sniper

17:43.797 --> 17:46.164
Who killed one of his men
the day before.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.632
He shot that villager
in self-defense.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.133
That may be.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.202
It's for your army
court-martial to decide.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.638
My agency's concern
is with the murder

17:53.640 --> 17:56.374
Of a u.S. Marine
in washington, dc.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.242
The court-martial
is not going to happen.

18:00.212 --> 18:04.282
And I want ncis
to stop harassing my client.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.751
You know what I think?

18:06.753 --> 18:10.755
This whole thing is just
some inter-service rivalry.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.457
You're wrong there, major.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.259
Ncis is a civilian agency.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.763
We don't report
to anyone in uniform.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.632
We will follow
every possible lead...

18:21.634 --> 18:24.135
Wherever it may take us.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.270
Get waters over here,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.573
Or we'll drag him in
in handcuffs.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.654
Hey, abby.
Hey.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.157
Still working
on the facial recognition?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.426
Yeah. The beard's making
it kind of difficult.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.728
Hey, uh, where is mcgee?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.663
I've taken over
his investigation

18:52.665 --> 18:56.234
On lieutenant waters' unit,
but can't read his handwriting.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.237
He's, um... He's in there

18:59.239 --> 19:01.739
With tony and christopher
from tech services, but

19:01.741 --> 19:03.374
Proceed with caution.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.376
He's not a happy camper.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.247
Tony:
Yeah.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.315
Yeah, that's real
good, christopher.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.217
It's gonna cover the
earpiece. Perfect.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.319
We just need a little more grime
under the nails.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.155
Tony, stay out of it.
Yeah.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.156
I can do more.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.557
What do you think, bishop?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.359
Mmm... Wow. You look...

19:21.361 --> 19:22.760
Homeless.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.296
So, uh, I'm going
over your notes,

19:25.298 --> 19:26.931
And at the end
of your interview

19:26.933 --> 19:29.734
With the medic on
lieutenant waters' team...

19:29.736 --> 19:32.803
Uh, can't make this out.
It looks like "wpf"?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.372
Yeah. That's
my shorthand.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.207
Wpf-- "when pigs fly."

19:36.209 --> 19:37.775
I didn't believe a word
the guy said.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.211
Ah. Thanks.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.583
(computer beeps)

19:54.493 --> 19:56.794
Tony:
<i>All right, I think</i>

19:56.796 --> 19:58.629
We got the visual
perfect here.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.464
But we're missing something.

20:00.466 --> 20:01.599
What are we missing?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.367
Odor.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.735
Oh, I didn't know you
wanted to go that far.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.904
Uh, I don't.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.273
I've got something.
(sniffing)

20:09.275 --> 20:11.275
Oh, wow. That's nice.
(spray hissing)

20:11.277 --> 20:13.311
Oh, god. Oh.
Oh.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.279
Aah! God, what is that?
(coughing)

20:15.281 --> 20:16.380
Oh!

20:16.382 --> 20:17.615
Certified, purified,

20:17.617 --> 20:19.350
Organic cat urine
and body odor.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.518
Oh.
Bishop:
Ew!

20:20.520 --> 20:21.652
Bishop (coughs):
Ew.
Oh.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.888
I'm out of here.

20:25.324 --> 20:27.358
Oh, my god! You guys.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.760
You're destroying my lab.

20:29.762 --> 20:30.995
Okay, I've got
facial recognition back.

20:30.997 --> 20:34.365
Blue's real name
is everett turpin.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.701
It's so weird. I've never
thought of him as an everett.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.003
But he was a petty officer first
class, and he was honorably

20:39.005 --> 20:40.638
Discharged in June 2003.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.374
Oh! Clean up this stuff!

20:43.376 --> 20:45.409
Oh.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.644
You're going
to pay for this, tony.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.579
Hmm?

20:56.521 --> 20:57.922
You're still here.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.357
Oh, yeah.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.725
How's it going?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.893
Uh, could use some help.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.396
Yeah? What's the problem?

21:05.398 --> 21:06.897
The civilian lawyer
representing the members

21:06.899 --> 21:09.300
Of lieutenant waters' team
isn't cooperating.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.868
Won't give us
handwriting samples

21:10.870 --> 21:12.303
To compare
to the threatening note

21:12.305 --> 21:14.739
Found in sergeant roe's
apartment.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.574
(grunts)
I'll make a call.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.576
You check the logs
on lieutenant waters?

21:18.578 --> 21:19.910
Mcgee did.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.280
The only times
he left fort mcnair were

21:22.282 --> 21:23.748
For court-martial appearances

21:23.750 --> 21:26.417
And his interview
with you on Monday.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.419
And he was accompanied
at all times

21:28.421 --> 21:31.055
By his jag lawyer,
major huggins.

21:31.057 --> 21:35.726
Fort mcnair is only minutes from
the abandoned building where

21:35.728 --> 21:37.828
Sergeant roe's
body was found.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.330
Could he have slipped off base?

21:39.332 --> 21:40.798
Waters wearing an
electronic monitor?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.067
Nope. He just has
to check in every two hours.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.470
You heard from mcgee or dinozzo?

21:46.472 --> 21:50.474
Uh, not a word, and
they've been gone for hours.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.849
Tony (over radio):
You better pick out
a spot, mcgrubby.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.718
All the good ones
are getting taken.

22:03.388 --> 22:05.489
I'm not spending
the night out here, tony.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.458
I'm cold and I'm starving.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.327
I'd say stop by the car--
there's a

22:09.329 --> 22:11.395
Slice of pizza left, but...

22:11.397 --> 22:13.597
We can't blow your cover, man.

22:13.599 --> 22:16.100
I've been out here for hours
and I've gotten nowhere.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.568
No one's seen him for days.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.936
They think he moved on.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.371
Don't give up.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.739
Boy, it's pretty toasty
in this car.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.873
You know, this isn't working.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.041
I want to go home.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.343
You're not leaving.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.545
If you don't drive me,
I'll take a cab.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.448
(chuckles) good luck finding
one in this neighborhood,

22:30.450 --> 22:33.084
Especially looking
and smelling like you do.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.385
You know what?

22:34.387 --> 22:35.586
I'm walking to the car,

22:35.588 --> 22:37.488
Right now.
I'll leave.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.956
No, you won't.
Hey, I got an idea.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.624
Why don't you go back
to the mission?

22:40.626 --> 22:42.927
They got a bed there.
And a hot meal.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.428
Maybe you can make some friends.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.763
Maybe somebody knew something.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.569
Mcgee.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.406
On your six.
Hey, you, stop.

23:01.113 --> 23:04.582
You the guy asking about blue?

23:08.987 --> 23:10.855
Uh, yeah.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.089
What's he to you?

23:13.959 --> 23:15.860
He helped me out.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.728
I owe him.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.397
Have you seen him?

23:20.499 --> 23:22.566
A few days ago.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.734
Wasn't looking good.

23:25.537 --> 23:27.405
Man:
You see that nosy photographer
that was following him around?

23:27.407 --> 23:28.539
Mcgee:
Yeah.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.074
I heard he took him to get help.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.510
Where'd they go?

23:32.512 --> 23:35.179
Doesn't matter.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.415
Rumor is blue died.

23:47.626 --> 23:50.094
Thank you very much.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.863
Everett turpin,
aka blue,

23:52.865 --> 23:54.198
Died last Wednesday night

23:54.200 --> 23:57.435
At the first street
urgent care clinic.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.470
What's the cause of death?
Catastrophic heart failure.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.572
Last Wednesday. That's one day
before ducky estimated

24:01.574 --> 24:03.874
Sergeant roe
was murdered by an overdose.
Bishop: The building

24:03.876 --> 24:06.210
Where we found his body isn't
that far from the clinic.

24:06.212 --> 24:09.480
So a marine photojournalist is
doing a story on a homeless vet.

24:09.482 --> 24:12.049
24 hours later,
they're both dead.
What's the connection?

24:12.051 --> 24:13.451
Boss, I don't think
that we should

24:13.453 --> 24:14.885
Rule out lieutenant waters
and his team.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.720
Sergeant roe was
gonna be the key witness

24:16.722 --> 24:18.122
Against him. Roe received

24:18.124 --> 24:19.924
A threatening letter
from somebody.

24:19.926 --> 24:23.227
Waters' team is in washington
as potential witnesses.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.728
I say we put a little
pressure on them.

24:24.730 --> 24:25.963
Well, yeah. Go for it, mcgee.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.498
Yeah.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.666
Hey, guys.

24:30.168 --> 24:32.069
Did you find blue?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.145
Hey, abbs.

24:42.881 --> 24:45.916
Hey. I'm sorry.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.554
He's dead.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.729
What happened?

25:00.098 --> 25:01.599
He had a heart attack.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.569
Oh.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.573
Oh, he was such a...

25:09.575 --> 25:11.575
Such a sweet man.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.511
He had such kind eyes.

25:13.513 --> 25:16.247
I thought maybe
he had some problems.

25:16.249 --> 25:18.249
And dave was
such a good companion.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.750
He kept him all...

25:19.752 --> 25:22.853
Calm and together.

25:24.222 --> 25:27.057
I wish I could have
done more to help him.

25:28.994 --> 25:31.695
Abby, you can't solve
everyone's problems.

25:31.697 --> 25:34.131
Some people have demons
they have to overcome.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.536
Abby:
Yeah.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.671
Wait, what about dave?

25:40.673 --> 25:42.640
The dog?
Where is he?

25:42.642 --> 25:44.575
We didn't see him.

25:53.318 --> 25:55.786
(indistinct chatter,
baby crying)

26:03.662 --> 26:06.130
I couldn't imagine
living on the streets.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.998
Lot of reasons that
happens, bishop.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.568
At least there's
a place like this.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.736
Sorry to keep you
waiting, agent gibbs.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.339
I'm lorin davis.
I'm the clinic director.

26:15.341 --> 26:18.709
I was dealing with a woman in
there with a very sick infant.
Yeah.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.244
No problem. This is
special agent bishop.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.313
Please, have a seat.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.016
You were asking
about everett turpin.

26:26.018 --> 26:29.019
I believe he was known
in the neighborhood as blue.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.155
We were told he died
of heart failure.
Yes.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.991
It was very sad. He wasn't
that old. But, you know,

26:33.993 --> 26:35.593
Life on the streets
can be very tough.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.262
When did he come in?
Um... Last Wednesday.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.165
He was complaining of shortness
of breath and chest pains.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.367
How long after blue
came in did he die?

26:43.369 --> 26:45.636
You know, it was
all very sudden.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.338
Uh, his vitals
were taken.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.772
Blood pressure was low.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.275
The attending physician
ordered an ekg,

26:51.277 --> 26:53.377
One of the nurses
was about to administer it--

26:53.379 --> 26:55.379
That's when he went
into full cardiac arrest.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.681
The doctor immediately
tried to resuscitate him

26:57.683 --> 27:00.718
With a defibrillator,
and that's when I a called 911.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.819
Where were you gonna send him?

27:01.821 --> 27:03.354
Uh, the e.R.
At washington general.

27:03.356 --> 27:05.055
We're not equipped
to handle something like that.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.624
We're just a clinic.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.325
Did the paramedics get here?

27:08.327 --> 27:10.661
Yes, within ten minutes.
But it was too late.

27:10.663 --> 27:11.862
Who called time of death?
Dr. Novak.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.131
He here now?
No. No, dr. Novak

27:14.133 --> 27:16.200
Has a private practice
in reston.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.702
He donates one day
of his week to help here.

27:18.704 --> 27:20.671
Novak sign
the death certificate?
Yes.

27:20.673 --> 27:24.008
Did, uh... Did this
man bring blue in?

27:24.010 --> 27:27.111
You know, he wasn't
wearing a uniform...

27:27.113 --> 27:28.846
But yeah, I think
that's the guy.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.749
In fact, I remember talking
to him in the waiting room.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.851
He was very concerned
about his friend.

27:33.853 --> 27:36.720
And after blue passed, he spent
a private moment with the body.
Can we get a copy

27:36.722 --> 27:39.023
Of turpin's death certificate
and medical file?

27:39.025 --> 27:41.725
Oh, uh, certainly.

27:41.727 --> 27:43.360
Thank you.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.096
Is it always this busy here?

27:46.098 --> 27:48.232
Well, more so this year.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.300
It was a long, cold winter.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.369
Had to be tough
living on the streets.

28:00.745 --> 28:02.112
(barking)

28:02.114 --> 28:04.314
Dave, stop it.

28:05.283 --> 28:06.784
What's the matter?

28:06.786 --> 28:10.120
Dave. Hi.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.789
Hi. Hi.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.224
Hi. I've been looking
all over for you.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.828
I was so worried. Hi. Hi.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.163
Hey, I'm abby.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.397
How do you know dave?

28:20.399 --> 28:22.833
Um, well, I used to see him

28:22.835 --> 28:23.767
All the time
with blue.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.436
Over by
the off-ramp.

28:25.438 --> 28:29.440
I feed him.
And he loves these biscuits.

28:29.442 --> 28:31.108
Hi.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.409
Where'd you find him?

28:32.411 --> 28:33.911
What, you think I stole him?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.848
Blue asked me to watch him.

28:40.318 --> 28:42.753
Um...

28:45.223 --> 28:46.790
Blue passed away.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.803
Blue never leaves dave
for more than a day.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.338
I figured it was bad.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.809
What's your name?

29:08.847 --> 29:11.849
How long have you known blue?
I don't know.

29:17.522 --> 29:19.523
He looked out for me.

29:23.528 --> 29:26.029
Like a big brother.
(short laugh)

29:26.031 --> 29:28.365
I could totally see that.

29:29.868 --> 29:32.903
So where's your family?
Dead.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.538
Where do you live?
I mean, do you have

29:34.540 --> 29:36.807
A place to sleep?
Lady, you ask too
many questions.

29:37.909 --> 29:40.310
Come on, dave.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.379
(barks)

29:46.151 --> 29:48.218
(dave barking)

30:00.398 --> 30:01.899
Jethro.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.066
Gibbs:
In here.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.268
Sorry I'm late.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.136
Former petty officer turpin's

30:06.138 --> 30:07.838
Medical records arrived

30:07.840 --> 30:09.273
From the veterans administration

30:09.275 --> 30:12.509
Just as I was leaving.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.977
Want something to drink?

30:13.979 --> 30:15.913
No, not yet,
thanks.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.315
Records indicate any
history of heart disease?

30:18.317 --> 30:19.583
No.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.352
But turpin hadn't been seen

30:22.354 --> 30:25.489
By a va doctor in years.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.990
Any hint at why he was homeless?

30:26.992 --> 30:29.927
Well, he was treated
for alcoholism

30:29.929 --> 30:31.962
Two years after his discharge.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.263
One could assume

30:33.265 --> 30:35.866
It was an ongoing problem.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.868
The va's got a lot of
programs for vets, duck.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.603
Wonder why turpin was
living on the streets.

30:39.605 --> 30:42.940
I recently read a hud report.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.876
It estimates,
on any given night,

30:45.878 --> 30:49.913
Between 50,000 and 60,000
men and women

30:49.915 --> 30:52.950
Who have served
are sleeping on the streets

30:52.952 --> 30:54.952
Or in shelters.

30:54.954 --> 30:59.890
What happens to the body of
a homeless vet when they die?

30:59.892 --> 31:03.227
It's transferred to the morgue.

31:03.229 --> 31:06.463
It's held there for 30 days

31:06.465 --> 31:09.233
While they search
for next of kin.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.635
If none are found,

31:11.637 --> 31:13.937
Then the remains
are cremated.

31:13.939 --> 31:17.441
The ashes are then sent
back to the va for burial.

31:17.443 --> 31:18.942
Do they perform an autopsy?

31:18.944 --> 31:20.644
None is required if the patient

31:20.646 --> 31:22.546
Is under a doctor's care

31:22.548 --> 31:24.581
At the time of death.

31:24.583 --> 31:28.385
Autopsies are rarely
performed on the homeless.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.455
Just out of curiosity:

31:31.457 --> 31:33.523
Why are you asking this?

31:35.226 --> 31:38.161
Someone wanted ncis to believe
that staff sergeant roe

31:38.163 --> 31:41.031
Had committed suicide.
He didn't; he was murdered.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.333
Roe was doing a story

31:43.335 --> 31:45.035
On a homeless vet who supposedly

31:45.037 --> 31:46.904
Died of a heart attack.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.040
I think maybe he didn't.

31:52.010 --> 31:52.976
Interesting.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.912
Duck.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.914
Get hold of petty officer
turpin's body

31:56.916 --> 31:58.382
And do what you do.

32:07.358 --> 32:08.992
Morning, abbs.

32:08.994 --> 32:10.661
Morning.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.631
Who's emma carter?

32:14.633 --> 32:16.199
She's a homeless girl.

32:16.201 --> 32:19.937
She's looking after dave,
the dog. I pulled her prints

32:19.939 --> 32:22.973
Off that mirror
over there.
Hmm.

32:22.975 --> 32:25.409
How's she figure
into the case?
Well, I don't think she does.

32:25.411 --> 32:28.011
She was just a good
friend to blue.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.381
I mean, obviously,
he trusted her with dave.
Really? I don't remember her

32:31.383 --> 32:33.550
From any of sergeant
roe's pictures.
Oh, well,

32:33.552 --> 32:34.952
There's a reason for that.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.153
She didn't want to be found.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.123
She's a runaway.
Yeah, and

32:40.125 --> 32:42.526
Didn't want her picture
or whereabouts advertised.

32:42.528 --> 32:45.228
From nebraska, huh?
I looked her up on the internet.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.030
She's been missing
for six years.

32:47.032 --> 32:49.700
Her parents worked
with the police and the fbi.

32:49.702 --> 32:52.636
Had her picture everywhere:
T-shirts, posters,

32:52.638 --> 32:55.138
Milk cartons. They even hired
a private investigator.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.041
But they never found her.
So what are
you gonna do?

32:58.043 --> 32:59.977
Call her parents? The fbi?

32:59.979 --> 33:02.646
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

33:07.051 --> 33:09.653
Doctor, did blue die
of a heart attack?

33:09.655 --> 33:12.189
As advertised.
Myocardial infarction.

33:12.191 --> 33:15.592
His coronary arteries
have 95% blockage.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.362
Living on the street,
poor nutrition,

33:18.364 --> 33:19.997
Compromised liver.
It doesn't help.

33:19.999 --> 33:23.000
I found epinephrine
in his system.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.568
That would
have been administered

33:24.570 --> 33:26.403
By the attending physician
in a clinic

33:26.405 --> 33:28.572
When they tried to revive him.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.108
Also, bruising on the sternum

33:31.110 --> 33:33.143
And slight damage
to the rib cage,

33:33.145 --> 33:35.078
Which would be consistent
with cpr.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.179
So there was
an attempt

33:36.181 --> 33:37.447
To save his life.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.615
Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.350
You call all excited.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.552
Now you're dancing
around something, duck. What?

33:48.426 --> 33:50.027
What are we looking at, doctor?

33:50.029 --> 33:52.129
Both of
blue's kidneys

33:52.131 --> 33:54.131
Are missing.
Yet there's no mention of it

33:54.133 --> 33:57.167
In his medical records
or the death certificate.

33:57.169 --> 34:01.071
Meaning what?
Someone stole his vital organs.

34:10.515 --> 34:12.249
Mcgee:
It's against the law
to financially benefit

34:12.251 --> 34:14.684
From the donation of
a human organ in this country.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.820
But, on the black market,
it's big business.

34:16.822 --> 34:20.223
A kidney can sell for as much
as $120,000 here and,

34:20.225 --> 34:24.361
In singapore, twice as much.
Ducky said organs have to be
harvested minutes after death.

34:24.363 --> 34:27.431
The attending physician,
dr. Graham novak,

34:27.433 --> 34:30.600
Didn't indicate anything in the
records about donated organs.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.836
Bishop, what do you
have on him?

34:32.838 --> 34:35.605
Uh, dr. Novak has
a prominent practice

34:35.607 --> 34:37.641
In reston. He's on the board
of directors

34:37.643 --> 34:40.677
At washington general hospital
and several charities.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.679
Married, two grown children,
model citizen.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.348
Not even a parking ticket.
What did I miss?

34:45.350 --> 34:47.250
You're with me.
Where we going?

34:47.252 --> 34:50.554
We are gonna pay the doctor
a visit. Come on.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.096
Hi, dave.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.264
Hi.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.666
I brought you
some dog food.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.601
Look.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.837
Boy, hi, hi.

35:06.839 --> 35:08.371
Where's emma?

35:08.373 --> 35:09.706
Where's emma, huh?

35:09.708 --> 35:11.108
How do you know my name?

35:12.343 --> 35:14.177
(sighs)

35:15.780 --> 35:17.881
Why'd you tell me you
didn't have a family?

35:17.883 --> 35:19.149
I don't.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.618
You do. Your parents

35:21.620 --> 35:24.121
Are alive,
and they live in nebraska.

35:25.356 --> 35:27.190
Who are you?

35:28.392 --> 35:29.626
What do you think you're doing?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.161
I'm just
trying to help.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.729
You don't have
to live like this.

35:32.731 --> 35:35.632
You don't know anything
about me.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.735
I know you ran away from home
when you were 16 years old. Why?

35:39.871 --> 35:42.172
Because they didn't
want me there.

35:42.174 --> 35:44.541
You'd be surprised how many
16-year-olds feel that way.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.743
But you're
older now.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.745
And so are they.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.614
Maybe time has changed things.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.316
Not enough.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.621
What are you doing?

35:57.623 --> 36:00.323
This is from last summer.

36:03.761 --> 36:05.262
Emma,

36:05.264 --> 36:08.665
I hope this somehow gets to you.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.934
Your father and I...

36:10.936 --> 36:12.936
Miss you

36:12.938 --> 36:15.338
And love you.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.842
We know we made mistakes,

36:18.844 --> 36:21.244
And we're sorry.

36:21.246 --> 36:23.246
Our lives stopped when you left.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.848
Please,

36:24.850 --> 36:28.752
Come home.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.958
Here.

36:34.960 --> 36:39.229
It's a prepaid
phone card.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.565
Just think about calling 'em.

36:46.604 --> 36:48.939
There's nothing to say.

37:00.551 --> 37:03.220
(sighs)

37:17.969 --> 37:19.469
Dr. Novak?
Yes.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.905
Ncis. We'd like
to have a word with you.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.907
Certainly. What's this about?

37:23.909 --> 37:26.276
A couple of
missing kidneys.

37:26.278 --> 37:29.012
Tony:
<i>Why would a respected doctor</i>

37:29.014 --> 37:31.615
Like you get involved

37:31.617 --> 37:34.517
In the sale of
black-market organs?

37:34.519 --> 37:36.987
It started as a one-time thing.

37:36.989 --> 37:39.623
You thought stealing an organ
once was okay?

37:39.625 --> 37:40.690
No.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.892
I was helping
an older friend.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.661
A mentor of mine.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.663
He was way down
on the organ donor list

37:46.665 --> 37:48.898
And wouldn't have lived
long enough to receive a kidney

37:48.900 --> 37:50.533
Through proper channels.

37:50.535 --> 37:51.701
So you stole one for him?

37:51.703 --> 37:52.802
I didn't see it that way.

37:54.338 --> 37:55.839
(sighs)
late one night,

37:55.841 --> 37:57.574
I was volunteering
at the clinic.

37:57.576 --> 37:58.908
An indigent died.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.511
He had no family. Nobody.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.513
He was going to be shipped
to the morgue

38:03.515 --> 38:05.048
Where he'd be cremated.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.984
It was meant to be:
He was the right blood type,

38:07.986 --> 38:09.486
Tissue antigens matched.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.988
His kidney
saved my friend's life.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.357
That's when you realized
you could make it a business?
No.

38:14.359 --> 38:16.826
I never intended to do it again.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.028
But you did.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.829
I was blackmailed into it.
By who?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.301
Lorin davis,

38:24.303 --> 38:26.069
The director
of the clinic.

38:28.706 --> 38:30.907
Was he brokering organs?
I never asked,

38:30.909 --> 38:32.575
I never wanted to know.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.777
But you kept doing it.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.613
I started to rationalize.

38:36.615 --> 38:39.683
Even if other people
were making money,

38:39.685 --> 38:41.851
Lives were being saved.

38:41.853 --> 38:44.854
Every year,
thousands of people die

38:44.856 --> 38:47.057
On organ transplant
waiting lists.

38:47.059 --> 38:48.958
Did staff sergeant roe
become suspicious?

38:49.994 --> 38:51.928
When he came
into the examination room

38:51.930 --> 38:53.863
To pay his last respects,

38:53.865 --> 38:57.067
He noticed the body
was still on a ventilator

38:57.069 --> 38:59.602
Even after brain activity
ceased.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.104
So you were keeping
the kidneys viable?

39:02.873 --> 39:05.108
I was concerned, but...

39:05.110 --> 39:07.110
Lorin told me not to worry.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.079
He said he'd take care
of the problem.

39:09.081 --> 39:12.048
Did you know sergeant roe
was murdered?

39:13.851 --> 39:15.852
No.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.954
Tony:
<i>Everybody stay seated.</i>

39:17.956 --> 39:20.390
Federal agents.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.692
Will you excuse
me a second?

39:25.396 --> 39:26.830
What's going on?
We have a warrant

39:26.832 --> 39:28.698
For the seizure
of clinic records.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.467
Lorin davis, you're under arrest

39:30.469 --> 39:32.669
For the murder
of staff sergeant martin roe.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.105
And when we're through with you,
the fbi wants to talk

39:35.107 --> 39:36.906
About the theft and sale
of human organs.

39:50.521 --> 39:51.988
Emma:
Hey.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.157
Hey.

39:55.159 --> 39:56.593
Hi.

39:56.595 --> 39:57.927
I was hoping
you would come back.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.429
Hi.

39:59.431 --> 40:00.697
Really?
Mm-hmm.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.166
I'm sorry. I-I forgot your name.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.834
Abby.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.836
Yeah, abby, um,

40:06.838 --> 40:10.006
Can I ask you a favor?
Yeah.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.008
Will you watch
dave for a while?

40:12.010 --> 40:15.612
Sure. Wh-why?

40:15.614 --> 40:18.748
My parents got me a bus ticket
to nebraska.

40:19.884 --> 40:21.885
You called them.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.753
Mm-hmm.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.756
That is... That's just so great.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.191
(chuckles)

40:28.193 --> 40:31.428
Yeah. I hope so.
(exhales)

40:31.430 --> 40:33.463
What changed?

40:33.465 --> 40:35.665
Thinking about that
video you showed me

40:35.667 --> 40:38.101
And what blue would've
said if he saw it.

40:38.103 --> 40:42.772
I never... Thought
I'd be out here this long.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.974
But I guess,

40:44.976 --> 40:47.710
After a
while, I...

40:47.712 --> 40:49.846
Believed I got what I deserved.

40:50.981 --> 40:52.882
No.

40:52.884 --> 40:56.186
You're better than that, emma.

40:57.822 --> 41:01.224
(chuckles)
that's what my mom said, too.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.759
(dave barking)

41:21.579 --> 41:23.646
♪

41:34.258 --> 41:37.260
"there but by
the grace of god."

41:37.262 --> 41:39.262
Yeah.

41:39.264 --> 41:42.665
Served his country honorably.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.742
How'd he end up like that, leon?

41:55.546 --> 41:57.614
Shame is it happens too often.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.017
I just heard
the court-martial

42:01.019 --> 42:02.819
For lieutenant waters
is gonna resume.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.587
They're gonna try the case
without the testimony

42:04.589 --> 42:06.289
Of staff sergeant roe.

42:06.291 --> 42:09.259
It's back in the hands
of the legal system.

42:09.261 --> 42:11.928
What happens, happens.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.297
I'm glad I caught you.
Petty officer turpin's

42:14.299 --> 42:17.033
Remains are on their way
to arlington.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.301
"blue"

42:18.303 --> 42:19.636
Is going to be buried

42:19.638 --> 42:21.304
With full military honors

42:21.306 --> 42:23.840
Next to staff sergeant roe

42:23.842 --> 42:25.208
In a joint
ceremony.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.110
Thank you for arranging that,
dr. Mallard.

42:27.112 --> 42:29.712
Oh, it's an honor
they both deserve.

42:31.282 --> 42:33.950
Yep.

42:33.952 --> 42:36.553
Let's go home.
