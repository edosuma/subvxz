00:54.521 --> 00:57.490
What's happening right now
is important only in the context...

00:57.591 --> 00:59.752
of our continuing evolution
as a species.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.159
Roger, all I'm saying is that I wish my
sister would learn to read a subway map.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.424
By saying that, you disregard
the primary importance...

01:05.498 --> 01:07.967
of utility in human relationships.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.231
Our ability...
Men's ability to read maps...

01:11.338 --> 01:12.771
to navigate, makes us useful.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.740
You should discourage your sister
from even looking at a map.

01:15.843 --> 01:20.007
Are you saying that we women
have an inferior sense of direction?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.942
Which way is north, Joyce,
without looking around?

01:23.050 --> 01:24.449
What?

01:24.551 --> 01:26.451
You heard me. Point north.
Quick. North.

01:26.553 --> 01:27.850
Quick. North.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.422
North. North.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.955
- You're right.
- Is he right?

01:34.061 --> 01:35.790
- He's right.
- Very impressive.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.023
As she has throughout history...

01:38.132 --> 01:41.659
the female responds to the male
who displays the most utility.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.636
By honing those skills
which make me useful...

01:44.738 --> 01:48.003
I stave off
my inevitable obsolescence.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.770
You stay home honing your ability
to program a VCR?

01:50.878 --> 01:53.972
My VCR's been flashing 12:00
for three years.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.216
What else, Roger?

01:57.318 --> 02:01.220
Oh, driving a standard shift.
Lifting heavy things.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.381
- Air guitar.
- Yes, yes.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.321
Go ahead and chuckle, okay?

02:05.426 --> 02:08.725
But until women evolve the ability
to move objects telepathically...

02:08.829 --> 02:10.295
And they will...

02:10.396 --> 02:12.524
Physical strength
remains a primary utility.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.464
Here's to brute strength then.

02:16.570 --> 02:21.098
Roger, you're forgetting
a very important male utility.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.470
What's that? Barbecuing?

02:25.646 --> 02:26.670
Sex.

02:26.780 --> 02:31.149
Yeah. I want a guy to do more
than just program my VCR.

02:31.251 --> 02:35.187
Oh, I'll program your VCR, baby,
like you never had it.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.553
It's a top-loader.
You think you can handle that?

02:37.658 --> 02:40.149
Interestingly, a group of scientists
in England...

02:40.260 --> 02:43.093
just announced their intention
to fertilize an egg...

02:43.197 --> 02:45.165
without the use of sperm cells.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.164
I don't understand that.

02:48.268 --> 02:52.227
Every cell in the human body
contains a copy of the genome pattern.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.331
The only reason sperm cells
have all the fun is that up until now...

02:55.442 --> 02:57.342
they were the only ones with access.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.725
Within Christopher's lifetime,
artifiicial insemination...

02:59.813 --> 03:03.271
will render sperm as useless
as an assembly line worker in Detroit.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.717
Luckily, my accountant set up a golden
parachute for my sperm years ago.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.015
In case they were downsized.

03:10.457 --> 03:13.949
Just so you know, Roger,
you know that we women...

03:15.195 --> 03:17.720
make love because we like it.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.890
- Not just to procreate.
- Yes.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.936
- But are men absolutely necessary?
- I don't know that.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.937
Think of the structure
of the female genitalia.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.701
Wait. Wait.
Okay, got it.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.401
What is the most sensitive part
of the vagina?

03:32.513 --> 03:36.313
- I can't believe we've gotten into this.
- I think you know this, Donovan.

03:36.417 --> 03:40.376
It's the clitoris, fiirst discovered
by Renaldus Columbus in 1559.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.818
He thought it was India.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.950
Oh, no! No!

03:46.059 --> 03:49.222
The crown of the clitoris
contains 8,000 nerve fiibers.

03:49.329 --> 03:52.230
It's a far great concentration
than in any part of the male body...

03:52.332 --> 03:53.560
even our fiingertips.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.761
It is the most effiicient,
pleasure-delivery system...

03:56.870 --> 03:58.565
ever devised by nature.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.299
Now, ask yourself...

04:00.407 --> 04:03.570
why didn't the clitoris end up
inside the vagina...

04:03.677 --> 04:06.168
so that intercourse
would be naturally...

04:06.280 --> 04:08.976
compellingly, constantly pleasurable
for a woman?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.277
- I know the answer.
- Yes, Ms. Maynard.

04:11.385 --> 04:16.185
Because in primitive time,
women died of childbirth.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.156
So for intercourse to be
too pleasurable...

04:19.259 --> 04:21.853
wouldn't make sense
from a Darwinian standpoint.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.931
- I'm impressed.
- Absolutely right.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.126
- What does that tell us?
- Evolution is looking out for us girls?

04:28.235 --> 04:29.998
- Exactly.
- That for women...

04:30.103 --> 04:33.869
intercourse and sexual fulfiillment
were never intended to intersect.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.536
New technology
just makes it offiicial.

04:37.644 --> 04:42.513
Future generations of women will evolve
clitorises... "clitori, clitorati"...

04:42.616 --> 04:43.878
"Clitorissimo."

04:47.754 --> 04:51.315
that are larger, longer,
even more sensitive.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.519
And a woman's ability, as well as
her desire to self-stimulate...

04:54.628 --> 04:56.528
will increase exponentially...

04:56.630 --> 04:59.030
as intercourse is robbed
of its procreative utility.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.174
- I'm confused and frightened.
- You should be.

05:02.236 --> 05:06.036
The species is not static.
We're in a constant state of flux.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.131
Two genders has been
the default setting for one reason only:

05:09.243 --> 05:11.507
So far it's been the only way
to propagate the race.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.512
Is there any species
that just has one gender...

05:13.614 --> 05:16.139
that doesn't have male/female?

05:16.250 --> 05:17.649
Starfiish, for one.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.879
Next time I see a starfiish,
I'm gonna tell him to go fuck himself.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.920
Come on. You love it.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.921
No, we don't.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.193
So where are we headed?

05:30.297 --> 05:32.424
Equality?
Equality, what is that?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.498
Is that a principle of nature?

05:35.602 --> 05:38.366
We all sit around
reading subway maps together.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.599
No. Of course not.
Natural selection.

05:40.707 --> 05:43.232
Now that is a principle of nature.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.903
Selection. Something has to lose.
Something has to be defeated...

05:46.013 --> 05:48.277
in order for something else
to be selected.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.350
So, what does this mean?

05:53.487 --> 05:56.081
We have to take orders from Joyce
for the rest of lives.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.719
That's right. I like that.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.658
It means that 10 or 15 generations
from now...

06:01.762 --> 06:03.787
men will be reduced to servitude.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.893
Technology and evolution
will have combined...

06:08.001 --> 06:10.731
to exclude sperm from procreation...

06:10.837 --> 06:14.739
and our fiinal destiny will be
to lift couches...

06:14.841 --> 06:18.174
and wait for that day
when telepathy overcomes gravity...

06:18.278 --> 06:23.079
and our gender's last remaining utility
is lost forever.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.480
Forever.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.880
Oh, my God, Roger.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.326
- What? I'm done.
- Then I rest my case.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.498
Thank you.

06:41.335 --> 06:42.962
Love you people.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.311
Yeah, this is good.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.998
- Jesus!
- No, just me.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.537
How did you get in here?

07:56.343 --> 07:59.210
- Where did you get those?
- Copied them from yours.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.112
- When?
- Last week when you sent me for bagels.

08:05.585 --> 08:06.813
Give them to me.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.388
Aren't you tired of constantly
having to buzz me in here?

08:09.489 --> 08:13.084
See how your brain works? How does
once a week turn into "constantly"?

08:13.193 --> 08:17.254
Actually, last week was two times,
including, I believe, Friday...

08:17.364 --> 08:21.733
when you woke me out of a dead, pleasant
sleep and demanded the use of my body.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.996
- You could have said no.
- What? Are you kidding me?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.765
That was a call to action.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.067
I dressed in 30 seconds
like a volunteer fiireman.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.175
I was insane...

08:29.242 --> 08:32.700
You should stop talking and listen
to me. I got something to say to you.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.178
Oh, yeah?

08:34.280 --> 08:37.511
- Words are my stock-in-trade, Joyce.
- I know.

08:37.616 --> 08:40.347
You can't just
stop up the floodgate.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.422
- Put that down.
- What?

08:43.924 --> 08:45.619
- We need to stop this.
- Stop what?

08:45.726 --> 08:48.422
God, I love watching you
in the bathroom.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.965
You're like an athlete after the game,
scraping off the war paint.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.398
I meant, we need to stop
seeing each other.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.129
Oh, really?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.872
This whole thing was a bad idea.

09:00.974 --> 09:04.102
Generally, I have good judgment,
but this time, right out the window.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.612
This whole thing is a great idea.
Nobody knows about us.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.909
We all go out, I sit there and...

09:10.016 --> 09:11.745
you know, a few hours later...

09:11.852 --> 09:13.820
I know I'm going to be
the traveling salesman...

09:13.920 --> 09:16.252
and you're going to be
the lonely housewife.

09:16.356 --> 09:21.191
I need you to be an adult about this.
No scenes.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.525
Joyce, I am your boy.
I'm your thoroughbred.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.259
Adult. Understand?

09:28.935 --> 09:32.063
Forget about the keys, okay?
Just keep the keys with...

09:40.881 --> 09:45.614
Tonight is our last night,
so let's make it a good one.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.350
Good-bye sex is never good.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.426
Next week, we'll have
"get back together" sex...

10:01.468 --> 10:03.993
- Can I stay the night?
- Roger, no.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.922
Right.

11:45.639 --> 11:49.268
Hi. Can I have a Cosmo and
a Maker's Mark on the rocks? Thanks.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.868
- Let's have a talk.
- I'm sorry. I'm with some people.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.139
Let me guess.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.346
You're relatively new at the company.

11:58.451 --> 12:02.387
Maybe you moved to New York from
somewhere else. Somewhere friendly.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.053
First you took pride in being alone.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.958
Wanna make a name for yourself
in the big city.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.692
After a while, you started thinking
how it might be nice to meet somebody.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.429
Winter's not far off,
and it gets lonely sometimes.

12:18.672 --> 12:21.072
Okay. And?

12:21.875 --> 12:24.901
And so you develop a crush
on your supervisor...

12:26.846 --> 12:29.280
even though the other women
in the offiice tell you...

12:29.382 --> 12:31.407
"Keep clear. He's bad news."

12:31.518 --> 12:33.782
- Why is he bad news?
- Because he's a player.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.146
He's a guy who collects trophies.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.885
Every woman who takes a job there
ends up in bed with him.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.261
And if you give in to temptation...

12:43.363 --> 12:46.799
you'll end up the punch line
to a sordid joke by the water cooler.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.367
Am I hot or cold?

12:51.204 --> 12:54.139
- It's a good story.
- It's a cliche.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.208
So what do you do
when you're not reducing the world?

12:56.309 --> 12:58.971
What's wrong with reduction,
boiling things down to their essence?

12:59.079 --> 13:02.981
What's wrong with...
seeing what's really going on?

13:03.083 --> 13:06.143
And what's really going on?
What's the big revelation?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.850
Why should I tell you?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.253
Telling you
isn't going to change anything.

13:11.358 --> 13:15.795
For instance, I could tell you that
what you think of as your personality...

13:15.895 --> 13:18.659
is nothing but a collection
of Vanity Fairarticles.

13:18.765 --> 13:23.202
I could tell you your choice
of sexual partners this evening...

13:23.303 --> 13:26.170
was decided months ago by some
account executive at Young & Rubicam.

13:26.272 --> 13:29.469
I could tell you that
given a week to study your father...

13:29.576 --> 13:31.703
and the ways
in which he ignores you...

13:31.811 --> 13:35.144
I could come up with a schtick
you'd be helpless to resist. Helpless.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.720
I could tell you all that, but what
would you do with the information?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.290
Are there women
who fall for this stuff?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.253
I'm telling the truth as I see it.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.125
You wanna go fuck your boss?
What business is it of mine.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.802
He's not Daddy.
He's just a guy in a suit.

14:03.576 --> 14:07.444
You feel compelled to contribute
to the pathetic...

14:07.547 --> 14:10.482
heartbreaking predictability of it all,
by all means...

14:31.404 --> 14:32.871
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:37.410 --> 14:41.278
- You waiting for someone?
- Yeah, my fiiance.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.782
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.321
All right. Congratulations.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.585
Is he a kind man,
your fiiance?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.664
Does he treat you with respect?

14:59.799 --> 15:02.529
Not that it's any of your business,
but, yes, he does.

15:03.870 --> 15:07.636
- That must make you nervous.
- Why would that make me nervous?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.208
Oh, come on.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.177
Look at the time.
Let's do the math together.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.974
What are you talking about?

15:15.081 --> 15:18.278
Let me guess, low self-esteem...

15:18.384 --> 15:23.481
and premenopausal... concern
led you to pursue a series of...

15:25.391 --> 15:26.756
Semiabusive relationships?

15:26.860 --> 15:31.297
But a recent dose of therapy
has convinced you...

15:31.397 --> 15:33.558
that inner-beauty
is what really matters, and...

15:35.435 --> 15:40.634
you really deserve that perfect partner
who treats you with such respect.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.674
Do you want me to call
the bartender?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.709
Unless you're an idiot...
Which I don't think you are...

15:44.811 --> 15:46.711
Unless you're some kind
of pathetic, self-help junkie...

15:46.813 --> 15:49.407
you and I know your guy's gonna
wake up one morning, and...

15:50.717 --> 15:53.049
He's gonna look around,
fiigure out how old you are...

15:53.153 --> 15:56.316
and what you're really like,
and that's the day he's gonna go out...

15:56.422 --> 15:58.390
for a pack of smokes
and never come back.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.990
By that time...
How you doing?

16:02.262 --> 16:05.231
If she doesn't see what's coming,
I fucking weep for her.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.875
- Can I help you, sir?
- Hey. No, thanks. I'm good.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.743
I said, "Can I help you, sir?"

16:24.617 --> 16:28.485
- Where's that other guy? The...
- He's home sleeping.

16:28.588 --> 16:32.354
Okay. Well, it's very important that
I see Joyce Maynard right away, so...

16:32.458 --> 16:35.086
Okay. I understand.
Why don't I just leave her a note?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.359
It's important
that I see her in person.

16:39.465 --> 16:42.059
That's not gonna work,
so why don't I...

16:42.168 --> 16:44.534
call you a cab and you go home
and sleep it off?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.730
Why don't you go fucking home?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.433
Okay. You know what?
We don't understand each other.

16:49.542 --> 16:53.444
I'm her boy. I'm her boy, okay?
Who are you? Who are you?

16:53.546 --> 16:57.949
I am the man who's gonna call the police
if you don't get out of my lobby!

17:48.201 --> 17:51.500
Roger, it's Susan.
It's Thursday, and I want you to call...

18:29.842 --> 18:31.969
- Roger, pick up line two.
- Who is it?

18:32.078 --> 18:35.078
- It's regarding the new campaign.
- Which new campaign? Get a name, please.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.680
- It's Susan.
- Tell her I'm out.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.620
- She says it's important...
- Tell her I'm out.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.992
Yeah. This is, like, surly.
That's like, "What is that?"

18:54.100 --> 18:55.897
- And this is, like...
- You want surly?

18:56.002 --> 18:58.163
- This is like '90s, adorable normal guy.
- I am that.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.171
- That's your problem.
- That's your nightmare.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.333
Hey, Roget.
You going to Joyce's tonight?

19:04.911 --> 19:06.538
What?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.340
- Didn't you get the E-mail?
- What E-mail?

19:13.119 --> 19:14.711
About the party?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.188
You going?

19:17.290 --> 19:19.918
Joyce throws a party,
I don't ask questions. I just show up.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.793
She's on a conference call.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.498
Ted, there's someone
in my offiice.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.768
- Bye, Ted.
- It's okay, Donna, you can...

19:36.876 --> 19:39.777
- Bye, Donna.
- I'll call you back in fiive minutes.

19:39.879 --> 19:43.645
"Five minutes"?
This is a fiive-minute situation?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.411
Sit down.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.577
I don't wish to sit down.
I wish to stand.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.556
Did you try to get
into my building last night?

19:52.892 --> 19:55.486
Why am I not invited tonight?
Everyone will be there except me.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.586
What is that going to look like?

19:59.899 --> 20:02.800
- Let's reestablish some boundaries.
- Let's not.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.763
I'm your boss.
You work for me.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.069
You write very good copy.

20:11.544 --> 20:16.811
But I have a hundred resumes
on my fiiles for guys just like you.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.612
But do those guys
do that thing that I do?

20:19.719 --> 20:21.482
The thing that you like?

20:22.355 --> 20:27.190
I have explained to you that I do not
wish to see you socially any longer.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.436
Find a way to deal with it.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.775
What's that supposed to do?

21:22.882 --> 21:24.042
Nick?

21:26.319 --> 21:28.150
Uncle Roger.
How's it going?

21:29.856 --> 21:31.653
What are you doing here?

21:32.592 --> 21:35.322
What? Oh.
I wanted to see where you work.

21:36.462 --> 21:40.193
- Yes. No. What are you doing here?
- What?

21:40.299 --> 21:43.029
- You mean here in New York here?
- Yes.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.662
I had an interview at Columbia,
so Mom said I should look you up.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.707
- Sit down.
- Okay.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.709
That's what all the phone calls
were about.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.177
- The phone calls?
- Yeah. Your mom's been calling me.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.909
- Did you speak to her?
- We're playing phone tag.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.247
She said you could
show me what you do here.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.321
She did?

22:02.421 --> 22:05.584
Well, there's not a whole lot
to show you, Nick.

22:05.691 --> 22:08.922
Really? Like, what do you do all day?

22:09.028 --> 22:10.996
What do I do all day?

22:11.964 --> 22:14.694
I sit here and think of ways
to make people feel bad.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.032
- I thought you wrote for commercials.
- I do...

22:19.138 --> 22:22.107
but you can't sell a product
without fiirst making people feel bad.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.206
Why not?

22:26.946 --> 22:28.914
Because it's a substitution game.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.609
You have to remind them that they're
missing something from their lives.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.549
Everyone's missing something, right?

22:34.654 --> 22:36.588
- Well, yeah. I guess.
- Trust me.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.283
And when they're feeling
suffiiciently incomplete...

22:39.392 --> 22:42.486
you convince them that your product is
the only thing that can fiill the void.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.825
So, instead of taking steps
to deal with their lives...

22:44.931 --> 22:48.662
instead of working to root out
the real reason for their misery...

22:48.768 --> 22:51.669
they run out and buy
a stupid-looking pair of cargo pants.

23:00.146 --> 23:03.912
- So... is it fun?
- It can be.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.814
Look, I actually was about
to call it a day.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.887
That's cool.
We can go get something to eat.

23:11.591 --> 23:15.118
- Fine. Let's get out of here.
- Great.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.619
You gave me a scare. I thought you
were having a narcoleptic episode.

23:42.722 --> 23:46.283
- What? When?
- Back at the offiice, you know?

23:47.760 --> 23:50.285
That's standing meditation.
It calms me down. Thanks.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.796
Why should you calm down?
You're a teenager. Thank you.

23:52.898 --> 23:54.866
My brain gets all sloppy
when I'm stressed...

23:54.967 --> 23:57.629
so the meditation helps me focus
and block out the bad stuff.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.501
- Bad stuff?
- Like fear and pain, you know?

24:00.606 --> 24:04.337
It's a visualization. I picture
a blue triangle, and that's me.

24:04.443 --> 24:08.038
I put all the other stuff outside
the triangle in a red fiield. It works.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.246
So, how's your folks?

24:17.289 --> 24:20.349
- They got divorced.
- What?

24:20.459 --> 24:22.484
Yeah. My dad moved out.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.995
- You're kidding. When did this happen?
- A while ago.

24:25.097 --> 24:27.463
I haven't seen you
since Grandma's funeral.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.699
- Jesus, Nick. I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's no big deal.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.299
I still talk to my dad.
He calls from the road.

24:38.411 --> 24:39.901
How's your mom doing?

24:40.012 --> 24:41.377
She's fiine. You know.

24:43.416 --> 24:45.714
- Surprised she didn't come with you.
- Maybe she was afraid to see you...

24:45.818 --> 24:47.683
after what happened at the funeral.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.847
That happened because
your grandfather's a king-size prick.

24:53.359 --> 24:54.917
All right?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.899
So when's your interview?

25:07.273 --> 25:09.798
- It was today.
- How'd it go?

25:09.909 --> 25:12.275
Fine, I guess. I did the interviews
'cause Mom wants me to.

25:12.378 --> 25:15.108
- You're not interested in college?
- Why keep going to school...

25:15.214 --> 25:17.774
when anything I need to fiind out about
I can look up myself?

25:17.883 --> 25:20.613
Dad didn't go to college. By the time
he was my age, he was on the road.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.018
- How is everything here?
- First-rate. Thanks.

25:24.724 --> 25:29.889
But... the good thing about college
is you get to hang out a lot.

25:29.995 --> 25:32.395
- It's good for the social skills.
- Yeah.

25:36.569 --> 25:41.768
So... my mom says you're kind of,
you know, like a ladies' man.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.105
- She said that?
- But she says it like it's a bad thing.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.179
That sounds like her.

25:47.980 --> 25:51.381
- Is it true?
- What about you? You have a girlfriend?

25:53.185 --> 25:57.144
No. I mean, you know, not yet.

25:58.691 --> 26:03.321
Look. I'm getting older, and there's
a lot of stuff that I wish I could...

26:06.899 --> 26:11.268
There's a lot of stuff that I haven't...
There's certain things I need to...

26:11.370 --> 26:13.338
Yeah. I thought you said
you could look that stuff up.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.430
No. I mean, not this.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.305
You don't understand. I need
someone who knows what to say...

26:18.410 --> 26:21.174
I'm kidding you, Nick.
That's what college is for.

26:21.280 --> 26:26.274
You fiind some football player who needs
tutoring, and he helps you get girls.

26:26.385 --> 26:29.354
- You don't get it.
- I get it. I was 16 once, all right?

26:30.289 --> 26:32.655
What are you going to do
if you don't go to college?

26:32.758 --> 26:35.124
Design software.
Maybe work on simulation games.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.707
That's right. You're the computer whiz.
There is money in that.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.797
I already make money
setting up systems for people.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.265
I'm working on a web page
for Granddad for his research.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.893
What, the old man?
He's actually spending money?

26:45.004 --> 26:46.198
Yeah, good money too.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.671
It's funny, 'cause he yells
at his computer like it's a person.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.833
He's always going,
"That bitch ate my fiile."

26:50.943 --> 26:54.470
- Or, "She's playing hard to get."
- You spend a lot of time there?

26:54.580 --> 26:55.580
Yeah, nowadays.

26:55.648 --> 26:58.845
I go over after school, and he
comes over and eats dinner with us.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.819
Wait a minute.
He eats dinner with you and Susan?

27:02.922 --> 27:06.824
Sure. Since Grandma died,
there's no one taking care of him.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.827
Even after they split up,
she went over every day to cook dinner.

27:09.929 --> 27:13.558
I mean, every single day.
She was nuts.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.205
Yeah, she was nuts.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.508
So, Nick.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.640
You need some help with the ladies?

27:33.052 --> 27:35.282
All right. Here we go.
Get this straight.

27:35.354 --> 27:39.552
Sex is everywhere, okay?
It is all around us.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.593
It's not some distant destination.
It's not Everest.

27:42.695 --> 27:46.256
It is right here.
You have to attune yourself to it.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.265
You have to bring yourself
into alignment.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.267
You have to fiind
the zone, Nick. Okay?

27:50.369 --> 27:53.998
Do that, and I promise you
a whole world will open up.

27:55.140 --> 27:58.507
Look at me. I walk around
in a state of total receptivity.

27:58.611 --> 28:01.910
- I'm like a fucking lightning rod.
- All right. Fine. What do I do?

28:03.182 --> 28:06.208
For starters, let's get rid of that
little meditation. The blue triangle.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.845
We don't block things out, Nicholas.
We let them in.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.320
Let what in?

28:11.423 --> 28:13.755
There are millions of women
in this city.

28:13.859 --> 28:17.090
Millions. Most of them are blessedly
unaware of the countless ways...

28:17.196 --> 28:19.926
in which their bodies
are exposed to our eyes.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.728
So, fiirst, learn to read the sun,
where it sits.

28:22.835 --> 28:28.535
You'll notice... correlation between
backlighting and transparency.

28:28.641 --> 28:31.667
They wear light-colored clothing,
underwear shows right through.

28:31.777 --> 28:34.712
Bra straps, panty lines.
No need to stretch or squint.

28:34.813 --> 28:38.943
It is there for us, okay?
For example...

28:46.558 --> 28:47.616
What?

28:47.726 --> 28:50.126
Are you blowing my cover
like some construction worker?

28:50.229 --> 28:53.255
- No. I was just...
- Use your head.

28:54.166 --> 28:58.432
Step back. Let her pass.
Okay? Give it a few seconds.

28:58.537 --> 29:01.904
Watch this, and then camouflage
the move. Pay attention.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.840
Checking of the watch is good.
Or of the pager.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.508
Or looking for
a street sign like you're lost.

29:11.617 --> 29:14.211
You saw me do a combination.
Whatever it is, don't get caught.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.948
Do you think women have a clue
what goes on up here?

29:17.056 --> 29:20.617
What do they think,
it's just stock quotes, drill bit sizes?

29:20.726 --> 29:23.422
They don't know shit!
Let's keep it that way.

29:23.529 --> 29:27.295
- All right.
- Watch. What about your eyes?

29:27.399 --> 29:29.959
- What? My eyes?
- Your eyes. How's your vision?

29:30.069 --> 29:32.629
- No, it's good. It's 20-20.
- Okay. Peripheral?

29:32.738 --> 29:35.468
- I don't know. It's fiine, I guess.
- Fine's not gonna cut it.

29:35.574 --> 29:39.032
You gotta work your muscles like you're
training for the fucking Olympics.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.908
- Yeah.
- Up, down, left, right, et cetera.

29:44.883 --> 29:46.578
- Here. Follow my fiinger.
- Okay.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.312
- Tell me when it's gone.
- All right.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.554
- Okay. Stop.
- That's it?

29:51.657 --> 29:53.784
You need a hundred,
a hundred and ten degrees...

29:53.892 --> 29:56.156
before you're ready for the street.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.229
I see behind me on a good day.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.488
- You play video games?
- Sure.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.499
Good. That stuff is training
for the eyes.

30:02.601 --> 30:03.568
Registering images
in a split second.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.796
It's invaluable.
Oh. Right there.

30:05.904 --> 30:08.464
Blue sweater. Blue sweater.
Median. Blue sweater. Blue sweater.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.108
That young lady just...
And you missed it.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.239
- I know.
- In just a fraction of a second.

30:17.349 --> 30:21.046
That's all. But a trained eye
can get in there for a look.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.713
You have to learn to anticipate
your opportunities, okay?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.813
Getting out of a cab,
wind from a subway grate...

30:25.924 --> 30:30.020
or as you so sadly missed there,
bending over to pick something up.

30:30.129 --> 30:33.030
These are situations which require
lightning reflexes.

30:33.132 --> 30:36.465
- I tell you, I can do that.
- Your a step slow right now, Nick.

30:36.568 --> 30:40.129
Hey, no wonder.
I remember what it's like out there.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.706
No interaction. No face time.

30:41.807 --> 30:44.970
Look at me. Every day I have
the street, the subway, the ATM line...

30:45.077 --> 30:47.170
the offiice, the gym, the...

30:47.279 --> 30:48.940
What have you got?

30:49.048 --> 30:51.608
Young people sitting in cars in Ohio.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.685
Wistful glances at the stoplight.

30:53.786 --> 30:55.617
No, I go to school.
That's interaction.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.313
Okay. Let's work with that.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.789
The high school building
is four stories, if memory serves.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.757
- It's fiive stories now.
- Whatever.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.091
It's multistory, and that means stairs,
which is good.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.655
Free yourself from the tyranny
of eye level. Come here.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.792
Use the angles.
High for cleavage.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.962
- Low for the skirts.
- All right.

31:16.075 --> 31:19.704
Remember, there's no shame
in calling on an old standby, right?

31:19.812 --> 31:22.542
Dropping of the pencil. Tying of
the shoe. Just don't telegraph it.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.208
What about reflective surfaces?
Mirrors, windows?

31:25.317 --> 31:27.410
What, in school?
No, there's no mirrors.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.919
What about that ugly
glass trophy case that...

31:30.022 --> 31:32.022
- Yeah, that's there.
- Well, use it. It's perfect.

31:32.057 --> 31:35.356
Go stand over there for a second.
Keep going. Keep going. Stop.

31:36.762 --> 31:40.061
If you can't stare directly,
turn your back and use the glass.

31:40.165 --> 31:41.393
Hi, gorgeous.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.936
Remember, angle of incidence
equals angle of reflectives.

31:45.037 --> 31:48.598
In other words, if you can see them,
they can see you. So be alert.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.937
- This is really complicated.
- It's rocket science.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.603
- You were smart to ask for help.
- I have a good one.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.441
When they're wearing short sleeves...

31:55.547 --> 31:58.607
and they raise their arms to fiix their
hair, you can see in that gap there.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.982
Now, see? That shows me
you're using your faculties.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.783
- Don't they know we can see in there?
- Of course they do.

32:04.890 --> 32:07.654
Breasts are very sensitive.
They know when they're exposed to air.

32:09.461 --> 32:13.022
Are women gonna walk around with
their hands clamped to their sides? No.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.327
Their hair has to be
dealt with eventually...

32:15.434 --> 32:19.461
and it is our job,
it is our vocation to be ready.

32:19.571 --> 32:23.098
All right. So all this looking is fiine,
but how do you take the next step?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.176
I need to meet someone.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.640
If you can't see
how the two things are related...

32:31.750 --> 32:33.479
there's nothing I can do for you.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.985
- Wait. Relax. Come on.
- You think we are kidding around here?

32:36.088 --> 32:38.249
- Do you think this is a joke?
- No. Why do you think I'm here?

32:38.357 --> 32:42.088
- You have got to make sex a presence...
- I'm sorry.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.128
- In your mind, in your life...
- All right.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.026
- In your spirit.
- I'm sorry.

32:50.235 --> 32:53.693
- All right.
- What? No. I don't smoke.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.432
Better learn.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.544
- Okay.
- Come on.

33:10.255 --> 33:12.223
Here. Wait here.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.575
Okay. Stay on this side of me.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.185
Excuse us.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.826
In, in, in.
Go, go, go. Hurry.

33:52.097 --> 33:53.564
Oh, yeah.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.965
Okay. We're in.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.266
Good.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.570
So, fiirst, a survey of the terrain.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.840
Technically, it's still happy hour.

34:12.918 --> 34:16.183
Your casual drinkers have yet
to pack it in. Lots of groups.

34:16.288 --> 34:19.451
Not exactly ideal for our purposes,
but not impossible.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.118
So, we need to make an impression.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.685
Send out a signal that back here
is the place to be.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.163
All right. What do you do?
What do you say?

34:28.266 --> 34:30.292
Who cares?
You're overcomplicating it.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.199
You spend the whole night sitting here
thinking of the perfect line...

34:33.304 --> 34:34.829
what good is that?

34:34.940 --> 34:39.934
Just make contact. Separate yourself
from the rabble. Watch this.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.451
Hey! Roses. Rosebud.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.849
Hi. Come here.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.752
Come here. Come here. Come here.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.592
Hi. Could you...

35:01.700 --> 35:04.362
Could I get you to take a... Yeah.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.573
- Hey.
- Nick here thinks you're beautiful.

35:13.145 --> 35:16.114
If he's got such good taste,
what's he doing hanging out with you?

35:17.215 --> 35:18.705
Good question. Nick?

35:22.921 --> 35:26.721
- Because he's my uncle?
- How awful for you.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.652
And so on.
No big deal, right?

35:31.763 --> 35:34.391
Now she's aware of our presence,
and we can plot our strategy.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.957
I'm gonna get us some drinks.
While I'm there, think of a hook.

35:38.904 --> 35:42.499
- What? A hook?
- A hook. A line. An opening salvo.

35:42.607 --> 35:46.543
Any minute now, Rosebud
is going to be standing right here...

35:46.645 --> 35:49.170
looking down at you,
and you're going to have one chance...

35:49.281 --> 35:52.910
to either hit it out of the park
or strike out miserably.

35:54.086 --> 35:55.246
Be ready.

36:30.889 --> 36:33.016
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.521
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

36:41.099 --> 36:44.626
Hello, Nick. Your uncle says
you have something to tell me...

36:44.736 --> 36:47.466
that will absolutely blow my mind.

36:49.574 --> 36:53.203
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Those were his exact words.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.440
Is he playing a little joke on us?

37:00.619 --> 37:02.883
No, no. He's serious.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.548
I mean, he's... totally serious.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.516
- Tonight.
- Sorry.

37:11.263 --> 37:13.891
Thanks. As I was...

37:13.999 --> 37:15.967
- Tonight.
- Right, I was saying that...

37:17.436 --> 37:19.529
I was saying that tonight is a...

37:19.638 --> 37:22.334
Tonight is
a very important night for me.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.069
I was just telling her
that we made a bet.

37:25.177 --> 37:28.476
- A bet?
- Uh-huh. We made a bet for $ 1,000.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.784
That I can get somebody to...

37:34.886 --> 37:36.877
like, fall in love with me.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.788
Really?

37:44.629 --> 37:47.962
Love. That's a hard thing to verify,
don't you think?

37:48.066 --> 37:50.466
No, I think we can do it.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.366
I'm confiident we can.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.437
A thousand dollars?

37:55.540 --> 37:57.599
That's not exactly mind-blowing...

37:57.709 --> 38:01.110
but it's not the worse line
I'll hear tonight.

38:02.347 --> 38:04.247
What? Really?

38:05.116 --> 38:07.676
Yeah. Good job, Nick.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.516
- So, do we rate a sit-down?
- I'm waiting for a friend.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.522
I'll run it by her
when she shows up.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.320
Get her over here.
There's cash at stake.

38:15.427 --> 38:19.227
If we do, who sits with who?

38:19.331 --> 38:21.856
Ladies' choice.
Natural selection.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.172
I wanna sit with him.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.812
Yes, yes.

38:47.692 --> 38:48.852
What is this?

38:48.960 --> 38:51.758
Rum and coke. I told him to mix it weak.
We got a long way to go here.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.730
- Okay. I don't drink.
- You kidding me? Take a drink.

38:54.833 --> 38:58.269
- I don't put alcohol into my body.
- You drink that drink.

39:00.038 --> 39:03.166
Loss of inhibition is crucial
to your success tonight, okay?

39:03.275 --> 39:06.039
Alcohol has been a social lubricant
for thousands of years.

39:06.144 --> 39:09.602
You think you're gonna sit here tonight
and reinvent the wheel? Please.

39:15.120 --> 39:20.080
All right. Now, you did one
very good thing. You lied.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.217
You made something up.
Keep that part of your brain working.

39:23.328 --> 39:26.820
We get those girls over here, your fiirst
instinct is gonna be to open up.

39:26.932 --> 39:30.265
To tell the truth.
Fight it! Just keep it interesting.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.769
Play up your novelty.
You're a 16-year-old in a bar.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.774
Why? "My father owns the bar."
You got a month to live.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.640
You're an actor researching...
I don't know. Improvise.

39:40.745 --> 39:43.145
Next, check the time.
What time is it?

39:43.248 --> 39:44.875
It's about 7:02.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.316
- Do you have a MedicAlert bracelet?
- No, it's instructions.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.116
I'm having my body cryogenically frozen
if I die prematurely.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.596
All right. Leave it.
It's spastic enough to be charming.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.099
So, the time. 7:00.

40:03.201 --> 40:06.728
We've got nine hours
until closing time. An eternity.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.632
Look at me, Nick,
and answer me this question.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.470
All right.

40:12.777 --> 40:16.338
Who is the greatest basketball player
in the history of the game?

40:17.849 --> 40:20.317
- Do you mean ever?
- Come on. This is easy.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.586
- Michael Jordan?
- Michael Jordan.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.986
Why was he the greatest?
Because he paced himself.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.321
Because he always
had something left at the fiinish.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.106
Magic Johnson called it "winning time."
See those guys over there?

40:34.566 --> 40:37.330
Yeah. Those guys think
they're kicking ass.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.164
Believe me, it is early.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.465
We are a long way from winning time,
so pay attention.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.632
- Okay.
- You say you want it.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.369
If you really wanted it...

40:46.344 --> 40:49.939
you'd be in here, suffering the tortures
of the damned with those guys.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.278
- What?
- There's a big difference between...

40:52.384 --> 40:55.785
being horny and being willing
to put in the time night after night...

40:55.887 --> 40:59.379
I want it. Okay? I go to high school.
You don't think that's torture?

40:59.491 --> 41:01.652
This is a lot of information.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.785
I'm giving you
the keys to the kingdom.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.157
Yeah, I know.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.458
How many boys your age
get an opportunity like this?

41:07.565 --> 41:08.565
Yes.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.473
So, stick your fiinger down your throat.
Drink ice water, call it gin...

41:11.503 --> 41:15.132
I don't care what you do. Be ready
to dive in at the moment of truth.

41:17.642 --> 41:21.806
So... how often do you, like...

41:22.947 --> 41:25.415
you know, like, get somebody
to go home with you?

41:28.186 --> 41:29.744
Every night.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.546
Bullshit.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.352
Just because you're not having sex,
doesn't mean the rest of us...

41:34.459 --> 41:36.256
are sitting around playing cribbage.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.187
What's cribbage?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.294
- What? What?
- Here we go. Here we go.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.736
Here they come. This is so stupid.
They're, like, twice my age.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.865
Champions refuse to lose.
Be like Mike.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.535
Here we are. As promised.
For one drink.

41:53.645 --> 41:58.105
- I'm Andrea, and this is Sophie.
- I'm Roger. This is my nephew, Nick.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.548
- Hi.
- He really is, like, 16.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.552
- I told you.
- Sit down.

42:02.654 --> 42:04.622
How'd you get in here, Nick?

42:04.723 --> 42:08.454
It's funny you should... ask me that.

42:08.560 --> 42:12.587
'Cause we were, before,
discussing it, and...

42:13.698 --> 42:14.824
Never you mind.

42:14.933 --> 42:17.493
I'm enjoying the air of intrigue
Nick brings to our booth.

42:17.602 --> 42:20.127
- Cheers, everyone.
- I told Sophie about your little bet.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.705
She thinks you're full of it.

42:21.806 --> 42:23.364
There's nothing little
about a thousand dollars.

42:23.475 --> 42:26.069
He's got to get someone
to fall in love with him?

42:26.177 --> 42:28.737
- A woman.
- A woman?

42:28.847 --> 42:32.044
Does it have to be a woman?
What if some guy takes a shine to you?

42:33.585 --> 42:36.053
I guess that would count, 'cause we
never discussed what gender...

42:36.154 --> 42:39.920
If Nick is willing to exploit that
little loophole, he can have the money.

42:40.024 --> 42:42.549
- What were you guys talking about?
- I don't know.

42:42.660 --> 42:46.596
- What were we talking about?
- We were talking about women.

42:46.698 --> 42:50.156
Specifiically, the pleasure to be derived
from admiring the female form.

42:51.870 --> 42:54.361
Imagine what it feels like
to be admired all day long.

42:54.472 --> 42:57.270
- Really.
- You'd rather be completely anonymous?

42:57.375 --> 42:59.206
- Not completely anonymous.
- Not anonymous.

42:59.310 --> 43:02.336
I myself would welcome the sensation
of a hundred pair of eyes...

43:02.447 --> 43:04.847
caressing my... booty
as I walk down the street.

43:04.949 --> 43:06.382
Guys always say that.

43:06.484 --> 43:08.816
Yeah. "We'd love it if women
were always staring."

43:08.920 --> 43:10.080
We would.

43:10.188 --> 43:13.282
You would love it if no woman ever
listened to a word you were saying...

43:13.391 --> 43:17.122
and just kept her eyes locked on
your chest or your crotch?

43:17.228 --> 43:19.492
If it led to having sex all the time,
I would not mind.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.691
You could deal with never being heard,
never being taken seriously?

43:22.801 --> 43:25.793
If I had something that needed saying,
I would wait until right after sex.

43:27.472 --> 43:30.635
Seriously, for a second,
just stop saying the obvious thing.

43:30.742 --> 43:33.540
Think what it would be like
if on every bus...

43:33.645 --> 43:37.046
there were huge pictures
of your naked body.

43:37.148 --> 43:40.276
- And on every billboard...
- Magazine.

43:40.385 --> 43:42.649
That's right...
It was just about your body.

43:42.754 --> 43:46.781
There was so much time and money and
energy spent obsessing and analyzing...

43:46.891 --> 43:50.054
trying to get a glimpse of your body,
that soon it felt like...

43:50.161 --> 43:52.061
the world had forgotten
about everything else...

43:52.163 --> 43:54.222
and you end up feeling...

43:54.332 --> 43:57.028
disconnected from your own body,
like it's not even yours.

43:58.670 --> 44:01.730
If you're really serious about
avoiding the male gaze...

44:01.840 --> 44:05.298
- If the goal is anonymity...
- I never said the goal was anonymity.

44:05.410 --> 44:07.139
Here's a little suggestion, okay?

44:07.245 --> 44:09.475
Putting on makeup.
Styling your hair.

44:09.581 --> 44:13.608
Wearing a killer outfiit and coming to
a place like this on a Friday night.

44:13.718 --> 44:16.846
That's when it gets interesting,
because at a certain point...

44:16.955 --> 44:19.753
- you start internalizing the male gaze.
- Not the best course of action.

44:19.858 --> 44:22.418
Male gaze. Madison Avenue.
Fucking patriarchy.

44:22.527 --> 44:24.427
Whatever it is,
it's done its number on you.

44:24.529 --> 44:27.862
Do you think you have any control
over who you fiind attractive?

44:27.966 --> 44:30.662
- Of course we do.
- I think not, and I'll prove it to you.

44:30.768 --> 44:36.070
Ask any woman, "What's the single most
attractive quality a man can possess?"

44:36.174 --> 44:38.608
- And what do they invariably answer?
- Sense of humor.

44:38.710 --> 44:41.178
- Sense of humor.
- Sense of humor is huge. Defiinitely.

44:41.279 --> 44:45.739
And yet, if two lean, mean,
play-by-their-own-rules...

44:45.850 --> 44:50.310
motorcycle-riding men
strolled up to this booth...

44:50.421 --> 44:54.323
and beat the shit out of us
two humorous guys, right...

44:55.159 --> 44:57.627
and asked you out for a ride,
you would be weak at the knees.

44:57.729 --> 45:00.061
- No way.
- Weak at the knees.

45:00.164 --> 45:02.792
Well, actually, guys who ride cycles
are pretty sexy.

45:02.901 --> 45:05.028
- Thank you. You see?
- Sorry.

45:05.136 --> 45:09.368
The fact is that touchy-feely, weepy,
in-touch-with-their-feelings guys...

45:09.474 --> 45:11.408
make you sick...
You're repulsed by them.

45:11.509 --> 45:14.137
Give me the Ice Age, okay?
Survival of the fiittest.

45:14.245 --> 45:17.806
No mixed signals. No bullshit.

45:17.916 --> 45:21.147
Just the meanest, hairiest bastard
wins all the time.

45:21.252 --> 45:23.049
Let's change the subject right now.

45:23.154 --> 45:27.921
You know, it's interesting.
All this looking is so masculine.

45:28.026 --> 45:30.756
I mean, you guys
are just about the visuals.

45:30.862 --> 45:33.592
Really. Why is it that when
I'm going down on a guy...

45:33.698 --> 45:36.462
- Sophie!
- No, really.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.899
Why is it
that when I'm doing my thing...

45:39.003 --> 45:40.903
why is it that men
always insist on watching?

45:41.005 --> 45:43.940
Why can't you just close your eyes
and concentrate on the feeling?

45:44.042 --> 45:46.237
It's not the most flattering activity
for a woman.

45:46.344 --> 45:49.074
I'm not sure that that's a...
Maybe we can help.

45:49.180 --> 45:52.980
Nick, jump in here.
A woman is doing her thing.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.220
Why do we have to watch?

45:59.691 --> 46:02.660
Well, maybe to make sure
that it's actually happening?

46:03.795 --> 46:06.229
I'll buy that.
Make sure we're not hallucinating.

46:06.331 --> 46:10.028
And maybe to fiile it away, in case
it's a long time before the next one.

46:10.134 --> 46:13.592
Two excellent answers. Perhaps you'd
elaborate on the fiiling it away part?

46:13.705 --> 46:15.195
File it away for what?

46:17.108 --> 46:19.599
- Oh. I don't know.
- Come on, Nick.

46:19.711 --> 46:22.179
We're fiinally treading on
some familiar territory here.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.647
Mom's in the kitchen
making Jell-O with fruit.

46:25.750 --> 46:27.877
- You lock yourself in the bathroom...
- Don't sweat it, Nick.

46:27.986 --> 46:29.886
I grew up with three brothers.

46:29.988 --> 46:32.786
The closets were pornography museums.
More visuals.

46:33.658 --> 46:35.626
You're right about the visual thing.

46:35.727 --> 46:37.627
It always drives me nuts
when I hear a guy...

46:37.729 --> 46:40.630
going on about something a girl does
that's supposed to be so sexy.

46:40.732 --> 46:44.168
- Like what kind of thing?
- Like how she flips her hair.

46:44.268 --> 46:46.566
How she stands with one foot
to the side. It could be anything.

46:46.671 --> 46:49.071
- What's wrong with that?
- Because that's nothing.

46:49.173 --> 46:51.038
That's just something she does.

46:51.142 --> 46:54.168
And she probably only does it
because she saw it in a movie.

46:54.278 --> 46:56.303
It's not their real stuff.

46:56.414 --> 46:59.542
All that stuff... the hair flips,
the mannerisms, the catch phrases.

46:59.650 --> 47:03.381
They add up to the personality.
So they are what's real.

47:03.488 --> 47:06.821
Yeah, but it's all the outside stuff.
That's fiine in the beginning.

47:06.924 --> 47:08.653
You need the outside stuff.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.660
You need, like,
the reasons to be in love.

47:10.762 --> 47:12.662
But you can get past that
to the part...

47:12.764 --> 47:14.391
where the little tricks
don't mean anything.

47:14.499 --> 47:17.593
I say you are attracted to
what is in front of you. End of story.

47:17.702 --> 47:18.930
How romantic.

47:20.538 --> 47:22.733
It takes years and years together.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.467
- Yeah?
- I can't describe it exactly...

47:24.575 --> 47:26.736
but it's like there's nothing
she can do.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.745
All her usual ways of hooking you in
have no effect...

47:29.847 --> 47:31.838
and yet you're still in love.

47:31.949 --> 47:33.849
It's like the act is over...

47:33.951 --> 47:35.885
and you get to the part
she's been hiding.

47:35.987 --> 47:39.787
And she's been hiding it
because she thinks that's the part...

47:39.891 --> 47:43.190
that's gonna blow it
or make you leave or get bored...

47:43.294 --> 47:46.855
but you get to that part,
and you're still there.

47:47.899 --> 47:50.424
And you're even more in love.

47:55.173 --> 47:56.401
Wow.

47:56.507 --> 47:59.738
Have you met my nephew?
His name is Jesus.

47:59.844 --> 48:01.641
How old are you, Nick?

48:01.746 --> 48:03.043
I'm 16.

48:03.147 --> 48:06.674
Stay strong, Sophie. There's
a thousand of my dollars at stake here.

48:06.784 --> 48:09.412
Are we still on a one-drink limit?

48:09.520 --> 48:12.546
- I think we can have one more.
- Yeah, I'm in.

48:12.657 --> 48:14.887
Great.
Scootch out of there, Sophie.

48:14.992 --> 48:17.051
- Who wants what?
- Sophie knows what I like.

48:17.161 --> 48:19.755
- Just some ice water, please.
- Okay, that's charming.

48:19.864 --> 48:20.990
Nick?

48:21.099 --> 48:25.001
A player might consider taking advantage
of this time alone with Andrea.

48:25.103 --> 48:27.799
Andrea. Yeah.
You can take your time.

48:37.849 --> 48:39.817
- Hi.
- Hey.

48:41.385 --> 48:43.580
- What's the deal with your uncle?
- I don't know.

48:43.688 --> 48:46.953
This is really the fiirst time
I've hung out with him socially.

48:47.825 --> 48:50.919
- Do you live in the city?
- I live in Ohio with my mom.

48:51.863 --> 48:53.831
She and Roger
don't really speak anymore.

48:54.665 --> 48:55.927
Ohio?

48:56.968 --> 48:59.095
Do you have a girlfriend back home?

49:00.204 --> 49:02.172
No. Not right now.

49:10.882 --> 49:14.545
Nick, can you do me a favor?

49:14.652 --> 49:16.119
Okay.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.227
Pick that up.

49:31.569 --> 49:34.197
- Protein for stamina.
- Let's switch, Andrea.

49:34.305 --> 49:36.899
- Okay. I suppose it's your turn.
- Yeah, good idea.

49:37.008 --> 49:41.240
Keep things fresh
and help us fiight that second-round lag.

49:41.345 --> 49:43.905
- What's that?
- That's a conversational lag...

49:44.015 --> 49:47.348
that often occurs after the ordering
of the second round.

49:47.451 --> 49:51.148
Actually, Nick was telling me about you
and your relationship with his mother.

49:51.255 --> 49:54.918
- No secret there. She's my sister.
- Your relationship with her.

49:55.026 --> 49:58.052
Not your relationship to her.
Nick says they don't speak.

49:58.162 --> 50:01.256
That's terrible.
I mean, you need your family.

50:01.365 --> 50:04.562
- Yeah.
- What do you think happened, Nick?

50:05.603 --> 50:08.868
My mom's a lot older than Roger.
Like nine years.

50:08.973 --> 50:11.237
You must have been quite
the little surprise, Roger.

50:11.342 --> 50:14.038
A nine-year gap doesn't necessarily mean
an unplanned pregnancy.

50:15.646 --> 50:18.513
But, apparently, I did come
as a bit of a surprise.

50:18.616 --> 50:20.584
Really? I didn't know that.

50:20.685 --> 50:23.085
That doesn't explain why you
and your sister don't get along.

50:23.187 --> 50:25.883
Let's just say
we don't have much in common.

50:26.657 --> 50:30.093
My mom says that when Roger was little,
he could talk himself out of anything.

50:30.194 --> 50:32.321
He never got in trouble,
even when he got caught.

50:32.430 --> 50:36.696
- She called him "Roger Dodger."
- That's perfect for you.

50:36.801 --> 50:40.100
There's nothing wrong with a high
verbal ability. Nick's got it too.

50:40.204 --> 50:42.331
I wanna be like Granddad.
He almost never talks.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.965
But when he does,
everyone kind of leans forward.

50:45.076 --> 50:47.044
You know, my dad's like that.

50:47.144 --> 50:49.772
The difference being that what
my father has to say is usually...

50:49.880 --> 50:51.905
some variation on,
"Get me another scotch."

50:52.016 --> 50:54.280
- Like father, like son?
- No, like daughter.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.012
- I get my...
- Whose daughter?

50:56.120 --> 50:58.645
- What do you mean, "like daughter?"
- No joke.

50:58.756 --> 51:02.283
Mom keeps a bottle in the
laundry basket. She has for years.

51:04.395 --> 51:05.919
- Oh, God, Nick.
- That's awful.

51:06.030 --> 51:09.727
She's not a wreck or anything.
She's just... What do you call it?

51:09.834 --> 51:11.834
- High-functioning.
- Yeah. That's Susan all right.

51:11.869 --> 51:13.837
She's always functioned
at a high level.

51:13.938 --> 51:17.704
- She's just really high, you know?
- How can you joke about that?

51:17.808 --> 51:20.333
You can joke about anything
that has to do with yourself.

51:20.444 --> 51:22.435
It's a basic human right.
Isn't that right, Nick?

51:23.781 --> 51:26.443
I think that's constitutional
or something.

51:26.550 --> 51:29.849
Freedom of speech.
Freedom to joke.

51:29.954 --> 51:32.218
You know what?
I need the ladies' room.

51:32.323 --> 51:34.655
Let's let the boys discuss
these new revelations.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.317
- Good idea.
- I don't... All right.

51:36.427 --> 51:37.894
All right.

51:40.164 --> 51:42.132
Be careful.
We'll be waiting.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.834
Are you sure you want
to get laid tonight?

51:45.936 --> 51:47.563
I thought you would
like to know that.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.572
I am not the one
who is here to learn.

51:49.674 --> 51:51.574
For most of us,
this is a forgetting place.

51:51.676 --> 51:53.507
- All right?
- We were talking about Granddad.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.571
- I fiigured...
- You felt qualifiied to jump in...

51:55.613 --> 51:57.513
and expound
on that particular topic?

51:57.615 --> 51:59.014
That's right. I'm sorry.

51:59.116 --> 52:02.176
You're an expert on that subject now.
You guys are joined at the fucking hip.

52:02.286 --> 52:04.186
I wanted to keep
the conversation going.

52:04.288 --> 52:06.552
There are four of us
in this booth.

52:06.657 --> 52:08.716
Think of it
as a game of bridge.

52:10.828 --> 52:14.093
In bridge, you have
two sets of partners, okay?

52:14.198 --> 52:16.098
If you hope to become
the kind of man...

52:16.200 --> 52:18.100
that other men
choose to go into battle with...

52:18.202 --> 52:20.568
you have to learn
to read your partner.

52:20.671 --> 52:23.640
It should have been obvious I don't want
to talk about the family tonight.

52:24.675 --> 52:25.903
A little while ago...

52:26.010 --> 52:28.843
we were listening to Sophie
describe herself giving a blow job.

52:28.946 --> 52:30.846
Don't you think that's
slightly more fertile ground...

52:30.948 --> 52:33.576
than what's at the bottom
of your mother's laundry basket?

52:35.486 --> 52:38.284
Pull your weight and steer
the conversation back...

52:38.389 --> 52:40.789
to something
in the same universe as sex.

52:40.891 --> 52:44.349
Remember, the thing that was supposed
to be the primary focus this evening?

52:44.462 --> 52:46.157
Don't make me resort
to the fail-safe.

52:48.065 --> 52:50.863
- Where are you going?
- Excuse me.

52:50.968 --> 52:52.959
No. Bad idea.

52:53.070 --> 52:54.469
Ah, Jesus.

53:24.568 --> 53:26.661
Everything okay over there?

53:26.771 --> 53:28.671
No. I can't go
with you standing there.

53:28.773 --> 53:31.674
- Why not?
- I just can't. Get out of here.

53:31.776 --> 53:34.472
Can't go through life
with a shy bladder, Nick.

53:34.578 --> 53:36.546
You're gonna be spending
a lot of time in bars.

53:36.647 --> 53:38.687
Most of them will have restrooms
just like this one.

53:39.984 --> 53:42.282
Fine. Then you go.
You go fiirst.

53:42.386 --> 53:45.355
I don't have to.
Just came in to rinse my hands.

53:47.057 --> 53:48.490
Forget it.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.827
- Let's go, kid.
- No, look. I'm with somebody.

53:57.001 --> 53:59.435
Uncle Roger, could you
please tell him? He doesn't...

53:59.537 --> 54:01.903
- How you doing?
- No, I don't know him.

54:02.006 --> 54:03.906
- Bedtime, kid. Let's go.
- Uncle Roger.

54:04.008 --> 54:05.976
- Come on, kid. Out.
- Could you please...

54:06.844 --> 54:09.642
He's my... Uncle Roger!
Really, go back in there.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.113
Look, I'm an actor.
I'm researching a role.

54:13.217 --> 54:15.185
- Good luck with that.
- Okay.

54:45.516 --> 54:47.143
- You okay?
- Oh, hey.

54:47.251 --> 54:50.220
I guess I should've waited
to use the bathroom.

54:50.321 --> 54:54.018
Okay. Unless the novelty of hanging out
with prom king here has worn off...

54:54.124 --> 54:56.752
I suggest we get a bottle
and fiind someplace with a view.

55:00.664 --> 55:03.963
- All right. Let's fiind a view.
- Let's fiind a view. Ladies.

55:23.687 --> 55:25.985
- That was close.
- That's good. Thank you.

55:26.090 --> 55:28.354
- This is the fiinest.
- That's good. Just a little bit.

55:28.459 --> 55:29.585
Thank you.

55:29.693 --> 55:32.321
Just a little. That's good.
That's good.

55:34.298 --> 55:36.095
- How do you like the wine?
- I like it.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.191
It makes my chest feel warm.

55:38.302 --> 55:40.896
- Roger, you're a bad influence.
- Yes, I am.

55:41.005 --> 55:43.405
- Alcohol, women of loose morals.
- And gambling.

55:43.507 --> 55:44.974
That's right. Gambling.

55:45.075 --> 55:47.270
I don't see Nick complaining.

55:47.378 --> 55:49.676
Although I have to say,
for women of loose morals...

55:50.748 --> 55:53.842
conversation has been
pretty tame so far tonight.

55:54.818 --> 55:58.185
With the notable exception
of Sophie's oral presentation.

55:58.289 --> 55:59.381
Shut up.

55:59.490 --> 56:03.256
It'd be helpful for Nick to hear more of
the female perspective of the sex act.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.385
- Do you agree?
- God.

56:06.163 --> 56:07.824
Where to begin?

56:07.932 --> 56:09.900
Nick will get us started. Nick?

56:14.338 --> 56:15.805
Go ahead.

56:16.507 --> 56:18.407
Ask away.
Any question you like.

56:18.509 --> 56:19.703
Keep it interesting.

56:19.810 --> 56:21.107
All right.

56:24.181 --> 56:26.615
I guess I'd like to know
what your fiirst time was like.

56:27.651 --> 56:30.051
- That's what you come up with?
- That is a great question.

56:30.154 --> 56:31.451
Thank you.

56:32.756 --> 56:34.223
I'll go fiirst.

56:37.494 --> 56:40.657
- It was my junior year.
- High school or college?

56:42.032 --> 56:43.590
High school.

56:43.701 --> 56:46.465
His name was Bobby Rushton,
and we weren't even dating.

56:46.570 --> 56:50.062
I just picked him out one day
and decided he was gonna be the one.

56:50.174 --> 56:52.472
- Why did you pick him?
- Sense of humor?

56:53.510 --> 56:56.411
Ha-ha. He was funny,
as I remember, but...

56:56.513 --> 56:59.311
it was something more than that.

56:59.416 --> 57:02.715
It was like this vibe.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.788
I knew he would be nice.

57:04.888 --> 57:08.483
He wasn't very popular, and I didn't
think he'd brag about me to his friends.

57:08.592 --> 57:11.322
- That's half the fun.
- Well, he didn't.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.396
He was just as nervous as I was.

57:14.632 --> 57:16.691
Which is part of the reason
that I picked him...

57:16.800 --> 57:19.997
because I think
I wanted to have some control.

57:20.104 --> 57:23.073
- You know?
- You were his fiirst as well then?

57:23.173 --> 57:26.336
Yeah. In fact, I went with him
to go get the condoms.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.468
We biked all the way across town...

57:28.579 --> 57:31.070
because we were so afraid
someone might see us.

57:31.181 --> 57:33.615
- We planned the thing for a month.
- I love this story.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.887
- Yes.
- So, where did you, you know?

57:39.556 --> 57:42.081
It was in my house,
in my room.

57:42.926 --> 57:44.894
My parents were away
for the weekend.

57:44.995 --> 57:48.658
- Did you bleed?
- The usual. Not too bad.

57:48.766 --> 57:50.734
Wait. So it hurts the fiirst time?

57:52.536 --> 57:54.868
Well, it really hurts...

57:56.407 --> 57:58.375
that fiirst second.

57:59.543 --> 58:02.341
And then after that,
it's just new.

58:02.446 --> 58:06.507
You know? It's like this
new feeling for your body.

58:06.617 --> 58:08.050
So how was he?

58:09.286 --> 58:12.312
- Matter of seconds?
- No way! He kept going like a champ.

58:12.423 --> 58:14.618
I had to ask him
to hurry up, actually.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.022
- Ow!
- Yeah.

58:16.126 --> 58:20.358
He did admit to masturbating like crazy
beforehand so he wouldn't just...

58:20.464 --> 58:23.695
- Like he wasn't doing that already.
- No, he sounds like a nice guy.

58:23.801 --> 58:26.065
- He sounds like a dream come true.
- He was a nice guy.

58:26.170 --> 58:28.604
He's a cop now.
He's got four kids.

58:28.706 --> 58:31.140
Early sex
is an absolute humiliation.

58:31.241 --> 58:35.200
Oh. Speak for yourself.
My fiirst time was wonderful.

58:35.312 --> 58:37.007
Oh, yeah?

58:37.114 --> 58:39.082
Let me take a wild guess.

58:40.284 --> 58:42.479
- An older gentleman.
- Right you are.

58:42.586 --> 58:44.053
- Married?
- Right again.

58:45.255 --> 58:46.688
How old were you?

58:46.790 --> 58:49.190
I was 19.
Freshman in college.

58:49.293 --> 58:52.091
Guess you didn't spend a lot of time
getting to know your roommates.

58:52.196 --> 58:56.030
No. No, I don't even remember
what they look like.

58:57.167 --> 58:58.964
So what happened?

59:00.304 --> 59:04.138
Well, believe it or not,
he ended up staying with his wife.

59:05.242 --> 59:06.800
What are the odds?

59:06.910 --> 59:08.878
What did you do when you realized
he wasn't going to leave her?

59:08.979 --> 59:12.210
Well, Nick,
I got over it eventually...

59:12.316 --> 59:14.284
and vowed
not to repeat the mistake.

59:14.384 --> 59:17.410
- And how's that going?
- Some months are better than others.

59:17.521 --> 59:18.954
- Uh-huh.
- Sophie...

59:19.056 --> 59:21.286
- I didn't say anything.
- What can I do? They're all married.

59:21.391 --> 59:23.552
I promised I would not be a nag.
It's okay.

59:23.660 --> 59:25.924
You, hotshot.
Tell us about your fiirst time.

59:28.966 --> 59:32.732
Actually, I think Nick's story
is much more interesting. Nick?

59:33.771 --> 59:36.069
- This I want to hear.
- Yeah.

59:38.675 --> 59:40.404
Nicholas?

59:40.511 --> 59:43.639
Well, this is hard to admit, but...

59:45.349 --> 59:47.977
I've never had sex.

59:52.723 --> 59:54.520
You're a virgin?

59:55.759 --> 59:56.987
Yes.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:04.097
That is so sexy.
Am I right?

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.101
- It's hot.
- Really?

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:07.864
- Yeah.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.565
- No. Never.
- Have you ever kissed a girl?

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:13.575
Yeah, a couple of times in junior high
playing truth or dare...

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:16.271
but they weren't like real kisses.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.711
No tongue?

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:21.645
I guess, but more than that.
They were just stiff.

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:23.652
Not like I imagined
that they should be.

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:26.052
Nick, come here for a second.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.488
Oh, my God.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.915
Now, don't fall in love with me
or anything, okay?

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:00.950
That was just to get you
through junior year.

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:02.685
All right.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.021
I couldn't resist
being your fiirst kiss.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.359
That's right.

01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:12.731
Forever and ever,
you will be his fiirst kiss.

01:01:13.604 --> 01:01:15.697
- Get away from me.
- Come on. For symmetry.

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:17.774
No, not a chance. Nick.

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:21.339
- How do you feel?
- My heart is beating really fast.

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.913
- He knows just what to say.
- Is he a good kisser?

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.847
Oh, he's gonna break some hearts.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.413
How 'bout down below, Nick?

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.680
Any, you know,
vertical displacement?

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:34.450
Leave him alone.
How you doing, Casanova?

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:36.185
- I'm okay.
- Sure?

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:37.920
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:41.395
Look, I confess. I'm married.
I keep my ring in my wallet.

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:43.466
Even if you were married.

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:49.572
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:53.400
So, Nick.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.775
Take a moment to fiile this away
for later. You understand what I mean?

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.106
Just think, Sophie.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.451
In the next six months, every time
Nick jerks off, he'll be picturing you.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.418
- Don't be an asshole.
- I don't do that, okay?

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:07.922
It's true.
Okay, so I'm not married.

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:10.084
What's important is
the emotional unavailability, right?

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:12.161
- That's what you look for.
- I'm leaving.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.899
And, Sophie, you've even provided
young Nicholas here...

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.992
with a particular image
to help structure his fantasy.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.138
Fuck you, Roger.
Do you have a place to stay tonight?

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.674
- He's staying with me.
- You can come with us.

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:29.439
He's with me. Unless you're fiinally
ready to do something constructive.

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:31.946
Like help Nick have an orgasm,
huh, Sophie?

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:35.143
- It's time to cut your uncle loose.
- You're disgusting. We're outta here.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.742
- You take care.
- Andrea?

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:38.411
- Oh, disgusting.
- Fuck you.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.353
Ladies? I...

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.991
Was it something he said?

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.424
Asshole!

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.462
But no. Don't I...
Okay, here's your chance.

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.485
What are you talking about?
Why did you say that?

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:52.262
Good cop, bad cop.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.803
I planted the seed.
Now go and close the deal, all right?

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:56.896
- I can't go...
- You think you'll get a better chance?

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:59.339
Go, for Christ's sake,
and remember the primary objective.

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:00.876
Go, go, go!

01:03:11.655 --> 01:03:13.623
Run, Nick, run.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:22.796
Sophie!

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:27.568
Hey, Sophie. I'm sorry.

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:31.005
Don't worry about it.
It's not your fault he's a jerk.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:34.635
I know. I wish it didn't
have to just end like this.

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:37.740
We're going now.

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:40.981
I suggest you
call off your bet and go home.

01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:43.878
The bet thing
was just bullshit, okay?

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:46.852
I know.

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:50.756
You take it easy, okay?

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:53.386
Look, I want us to...

01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:57.422
Don't spoil the wonderful time
we had tonight.

01:03:58.368 --> 01:03:59.995
You know?

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.244
This is to remember me by.

01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:19.621
Take care, Nick.

01:04:19.723 --> 01:04:21.691
We need more men like you.

01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:49.308
Hey.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:50.478
What happened?

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:52.384
What? Nothing happened.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:54.447
So you're oh for one.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.549
She wasn't gonna go for it.
I couldn't ask her.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.421
- You gonna sleep with Sophie tonight?
- It was obvious. She was not...

01:04:59.463 --> 01:05:02.296
Are you going to have sex
with Sophie tonight?

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:07.903
- No.
- Then I repeat: you're oh for one.

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:11.167
You need to learn how to fiinish.
Anyone can get halfway home.

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:17.307
We're switching to plan B. Hey!

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:21.744
I think a change of venue
will improve your luck.

01:05:40.737 --> 01:05:42.762
Wait! Hold up! Stop!

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.441
Do me a favor.
Stay here till we're inside.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.521
- So where we goin'?
- Finish up.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:37.551
- We're going to a party. Come on.
- Whose party is it?

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:42.421
Fuck! Over here.
Over here.

01:06:43.867 --> 01:06:45.960
Look at this.
Beautiful glasswork.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.583
Whoa, whoa.

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:07.853
Why we running?

01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:09.858
That doorman has
a hateful personality.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.622
Listen up. It's gonna be
a whole new dynamic up there.

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:13.957
Stay focused.

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:16.624
Don't talk to any guys.
That's a defiinite rally-killer.

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:19.566
Keep moving at all times.
No hiding in the bathroom.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:22.362
Here we are. Hey.

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.970
- Look who it is.
- Hey, Chris. How are you?

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:29.978
This is my nephew Nick.
Chris.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.173
- How are you?
- How ya doin'?

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.312
Wait. Do you have
a bathroom I could use?

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:42.391
- A what?
- A bathroom I could use?

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:43.550
A what?

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:46.462
I've been trying to shake
this woman all night.

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.898
This is Donovan.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.434
I'm the only one here
that's my age.

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:54.833
Where did you think we were going,
the junior prom?

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.696
I think I'm drunk.

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:01.403
Come here.

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:06.446
Nick. Do you know
where we are?

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:10.413
- I think you said Greenwich Street.
- We're in winning time.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.852
- Okay. Winning time.
- Right. Okay?

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.516
It's a little harder to recognize
than when you're in a bar...

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:17.593
but the concept is the same.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.660
There's an incredible moment
that happens when a party...

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:24.791
passes its apex, its peak.

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.929
As if by magic,
suddenly every person in the room...

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.006
is acutely aware of the time.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.270
It is at that moment
that the fear hits.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:38.372
- What fear?
- The fear of the empty apartment.

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:40.609
Oh. Yeah.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.947
That is more
than most people can stand.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:47.118
Desperation creeps into the room
like a fog.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:50.055
Eyes begin
to search the crowd anxiously.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.493
Standards are drastically lowered.
I mean, it's palpable.

01:08:54.397 --> 01:08:56.524
- You know what I'm saying?
- Not really.

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:03.227
What I'm saying is,
you have a real shot here, Nick.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:10.276
This is the moment
that separates a true champion.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.506
You remember the reason
you fiirst asked for my help?

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.578
The primary goal?

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.652
- Yes.
- Then let me help you...

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.550
to achieve it.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.596
All right. So.

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:35.728
We need to scope out
who the drinkers are.

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:38.671
Every party needs a pace car,
a rabbit.

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:42.871
Always look for the girls who are
two drinks ahead of everybody else.

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:44.537
How do you do that?

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:47.046
Listen for inappropriately loud
bursts of laughter...

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:49.380
or scan the crowd
for somebody spilling a drink.

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:53.183
Check the dance floor for somebody
working out of their zone.

01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:55.257
How about them?
They seem pretty drunk.

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:00.693
Good afternoon.

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:06.134
God, this is so embarrassing.
I don't know how this happened.

01:10:06.236 --> 01:10:08.864
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:10.269
Hey, Donna.

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:13.504
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.237
- Well...
- Good. Listen.

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:17.245
This is my nephew
I want to introduce. Nick.

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:19.440
- Hi.
- I saw you earlier at the offiice.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:21.642
Hi, Nick. Donna.

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:24.219
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

01:10:26.156 --> 01:10:28.784
- Roger's showing you the town?
- Yeah, some of it.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.149
Yeah, Nick's visiting.

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:33.559
Why don't you tell Donna
about the bet we got going.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:35.290
- See you in a second.
- Huh? Wait.

01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:39.533
What bet?
What's he got you involved in?

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:42.070
- Oh, it's nothing. Really.
- What is this?

01:10:42.172 --> 01:10:44.106
Oh, that. I don't even know.

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:45.504
- It's cute.
- Thanks.

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:47.405
I don't even use it.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.944
Eighty. Hot. Eighty degrees.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:52.241
That is hot. Yeah.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:59.120
We made a bet whether I can get
someone to fall in love with me tonight.

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:00.519
Wow.

01:11:01.224 --> 01:11:03.590
- For how much?
- A thousand bucks.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.888
Get outta here.

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:10.332
Well, so, how's it going so far?

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:14.294
Excuse me.
Thank you.

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:17.238
Thank you. Cheers.

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.534
Yeah.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.372
To love.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.782
Oh, hello.

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:40.590
You're not the infamous Roger Swanson
I've heard so much about, are you?

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:41.925
That's me. Yes.

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:45.694
Joyce says of all of her copy people,
you are the funniest.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.702
- I'm a laugh riot.
- No, she says that.

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:50.068
- Why would I lie?
- What's your name?

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:52.300
I'm sorry.
I haven't introduced myself.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:55.309
I'm Patricia. Joyce and I
went to college together.

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:57.504
Nice to meet you.
Patty, would you do me a favor?

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.741
Sure. I can certainly try.

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:02.818
See that kid right over there
in the corner?

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:04.887
- Yeah.
- That's my nephew Nick.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.888
- Oh, really. He's so cute.
- He is.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.117
- He's still a virgin.
- No!

01:12:09.225 --> 01:12:11.750
- Swear to God.
- Poor boy. How old is he?

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:13.351
He's 16. Now, listen.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:16.364
My time with Joyce taught me that
older women fuck like jackrabbits...

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:19.458
and Nick is at
his absolute peak sexually.

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:21.469
So, I fiigure,
the two of you go at it...

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.471
it would be
like Frazier and Ali.

01:12:23.573 --> 01:12:25.302
- Right?
- Something is wrong with you.

01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:28.206
No, I'm serious.
What do you say?

01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:31.439
- As a kind of a...
- I'm gonna...

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:33.345
Red Cross moment or...

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:35.508
Okay. Nice to see you.

01:12:52.435 --> 01:12:56.030
- How's it goin' over here?
- Hey, Roger.

01:12:56.139 --> 01:12:59.199
- Now, who let you in?
- Who let me in? You let me in.

01:12:59.309 --> 01:13:00.606
What?

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:03.675
You know, Nick here
is a real ladies' man.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.748
You're lucky he's spending
all this time with you.

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:08.112
Yeah, that's me.
The lucky lady.

01:13:10.286 --> 01:13:13.813
Actually... I think
I had too much to drink.

01:13:13.923 --> 01:13:16.050
- Uh-oh.
- Would you like to lie down?

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:18.354
Nick, Nick.
Excellent idea.

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:21.123
Good one. Come on, darling.
Let's fiind you a place to lie down.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.130
Oh, no. Just when things
were getting good.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.200
Things are still good.

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:31.897
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:33.908
- We're going.
- We are?

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:36.774
We're going right around
this little corner.

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:38.847
- Here we go.
- I forgot to eat.

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.047
Nick, stay with us.
Keep close.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.554
- Okay.
- Good.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:50.285
- All right. So I'll just...
- Oh, excellent.

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:53.791
- Are you all right?
- I'll just leave you two together.

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:55.386
- Okay.
- No, don't go.

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:57.989
- You're in capable hands, believe me.
- What are you doing?

01:13:58.101 --> 01:13:59.625
Hang on a second.

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:13.315
What are we gonna do?

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:17.284
We are not gonna do anything...
at all.

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:27.463
I'll be on guard duty, okay?

01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:32.664
You need to work fast. If I were you,
I'd switch to the two-minute offense.

01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:35.033
What are you talking about?
Wait, Uncle Roger...

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:36.735
Love you.

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:42.210
Don't go.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.125
Oh, let me introduce you.

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:59.194
This is Donovan Lehman,
Christopher Weland...

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:01.024
our two collaborators.

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.030
I think they're gonna be
perfect for you.

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:06.226
You told me you wanted something
a little bit magic, a bit surreal.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.860
Hey, hey, Donovan.
How are you, man?

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:11.303
- Roger. Hey, man.
- How are you?

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:12.704
Hey, Chris.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:15.204
Look at you two.

01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:18.678
You seem like the happy couple.
What's your secret?

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:21.581
Sorry. You know what they say about
dipping the pen in the company ink.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:26.219
- I guess so.
- I know what they say. Yes, they do.

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:29.788
All right.

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:49.244
Look at you.

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.613
Go to sleep.

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:40.744
I think we got sidetracked there.

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:43.080
Seriously, Donovan, with all
the pressure facing men today...

01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:45.210
it's got to be tough
to maintain a relationship.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:47.221
I don't know.
Let's ask a man. Chris?

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:49.314
Traditional male roles
are being tossed aside...

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:52.053
before we have any chance to make
an internal shift, don't you think?

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:55.722
Our culture seems designed
to emasculate and infantilize.

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:58.893
- That's a strong statement.
- Why don't you go and...

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:00.628
help yourself to some food?

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:03.034
It's particularly true
in a situation when the woman is...

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:05.505
two decades older than the man.

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:08.807
- Roger!
- Approximately.

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:14.149
We were having
this discussion the other day...

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.775
Is it your mission in life
to humiliate yourself?

01:19:16.886 --> 01:19:18.945
It's more of a hobby really.

01:19:19.055 --> 01:19:21.080
I want you to leave right now.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.283
You want me to leave
and go where?

01:19:24.327 --> 01:19:27.091
Think very hard
about what you're doing.

01:19:27.196 --> 01:19:29.426
Go where, Joyce?
Where do you want me to go?

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:33.796
You're through.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.303
You lied to me.
You are a liar.

01:19:36.405 --> 01:19:38.498
- I want you to leave.
- Who's he?

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.370
Who the fuck is he?

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:42.205
Who the fuck is he?

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:44.336
Who is he? What...

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:49.047
Don't get comfortable.

01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:53.555
Don't ever settle in
like you own the place. Trust me.

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:57.225
There's always something
gaining on you.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:20:01.291
And here they come now.
Hey, guys. Good luck.

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:03.194
Sorry. Take care now.

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:07.427
Let me get a coat here.
Take care.

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:10.004
Nice to see you.
Thanks, Joyce! Bye-bye!

01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:13.308
What just happened?

01:20:13.409 --> 01:20:15.377
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:31.184
That didn't go
exactly as I had hoped.

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.459
What happened in there?
What were you shouting about?

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.535
Doesn't matter.
What about you?

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:42.536
- Did you get it on with Donna?
- No.

01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:45.471
- Why not?
- Are you kidding? She was passed out!

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:50.477
Nick, you have had one golden
opportunity after another this evening.

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:53.104
You haven't exactly shown yourself
to be a clutch player.

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:55.183
- Hey!
- What happened in there?

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:57.616
- Are you drunk?
- I'm going home.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.120
- Where do you need to be dropped?
- What?

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:01.519
That's it?

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:05.594
We've had a full evening.
I think you're ready to fly solo.

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:10.591
- You said there was a fail-safe.
- What fail-safe?

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:13.626
Back at the bar.
You said there was a fail-safe.

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:14.862
Did I?

01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:20.300
- I don't think you want the fail-safe.
- No, I want it! Just stop.

01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:22.138
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:24.576
I'm not going home like this,
all right?

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.011
I'm sure. Okay?

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:30.317
You know what? You're right.

01:21:30.419 --> 01:21:33.547
Why give into a slump?
Let's go down swinging.

01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:36.124
- Yes. Like Michael Jordan.
- Right.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:39.194
That's the wrong sport,
but I like your enthusiasm. Let's go.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.050
All right. Thanks.

01:22:30.546 --> 01:22:32.104
Come on. Come on.

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:30.000
Hey. Two of us.

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:31.595
That's 200.

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.070
One... two.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:43.183
- Is he a minor?
- I'm an actor. I'm researching a role.

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:01.292
It's a hundred to fuck me.

01:25:19.381 --> 01:25:20.575
Tip.

01:25:41.937 --> 01:25:42.995
Come on.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.705
Wait. Just slow down.

01:25:56.285 --> 01:25:57.684
Please slow down.

01:26:53.342 --> 01:26:55.936
- We're goin' home.
- Hey! Hey!

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.012
- What are you doing?
- Easy, easy.

01:26:58.113 --> 01:27:00.946
Get outta here.
Motherfucker, get off me!

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.745
Motherfucker, get off me!

01:27:03.852 --> 01:27:06.548
- Get off me!
- Get outta here!

01:27:06.655 --> 01:27:07.952
Nick!

01:27:16.999 --> 01:27:18.330
Nick.

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:25.999
Nick, don't worry about it.

01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:35.674
It's okay. It's all right!

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:40.312
Nick!

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:44.848
Chill!

01:27:46.228 --> 01:27:48.196
It's all right, man.

01:27:49.298 --> 01:27:50.595
Jesus.

01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:18.218
Fucking booze.

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:29.567
Come on.

01:29:14.049 --> 01:29:15.380
Come here.

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:18.544
- Jesus.
- Don't tell...

01:29:18.654 --> 01:29:20.121
Go to sleep.

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.129
Okay.

01:31:09.398 --> 01:31:11.366
Roger, pick up the goddamn phone.

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:13.798
Nick is gone.
No one's seen him in two days.

01:31:13.902 --> 01:31:16.871
I am frantic,
and I need you to call me, please.

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:46.093
Oh, my God.

01:31:54.476 --> 01:31:55.943
There's coffee.

01:31:58.714 --> 01:32:00.181
I don't drink caffeine.

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:03.117
Yes.

01:32:07.823 --> 01:32:09.791
I keep losing my balance.

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:12.690
- That'll pass.
- Yeah.

01:32:15.097 --> 01:32:16.462
So, Nick...

01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:19.132
tell me more about Columbia.

01:32:19.234 --> 01:32:21.202
What did you think of the campus?

01:32:23.939 --> 01:32:26.499
I don't know.
It was fiine.

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:31.606
Did you...
look around the neighborhood?

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:35.376
Maybe you could tell me about the
different things you saw on your tour.

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:43.920
I'm sorry I got so mad.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.827
You're what?

01:32:48.497 --> 01:32:49.794
Last night.

01:32:52.701 --> 01:32:55.727
You were trying to teach me
the way that things are done, and I...

01:32:57.339 --> 01:33:00.240
I guess I kept fucking it up. So...

01:33:00.342 --> 01:33:02.606
So I shouldn't have gotten so mad.

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:06.641
I'm... sorry I disappointed you.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:11.385
Uh-huh. Okay.

01:33:11.486 --> 01:33:13.818
Anyone can have an off night.
It's happened to me.

01:33:16.725 --> 01:33:18.625
You said you score every night.

01:33:18.727 --> 01:33:20.627
I say a lot of things.
Look, Nick.

01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:25.098
Call your mom, will you?

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.100
I'm sure she would like
to hear from you.

01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:29.865
Forget it.
I'll see her when I get home.

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:31.939
Call her anyway.
Come on.

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:46.053
I'll leave you to it.

01:33:55.831 --> 01:33:57.799
I guess I'll see you
at the next funeral.

01:33:57.899 --> 01:33:59.127
Why? Who's sick?

01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:01.559
What? No, I'm kidding.

01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:02.898
Me too.

01:34:05.974 --> 01:34:07.874
All right.
Good-bye, Uncle Roger.

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:09.443
See you, Nick.

01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:19.749
Don't tip. I got it.

01:34:38.206 --> 01:34:40.936
How long does it usually take
to get to the airport?

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:43.408
- About a half hour, sir.
- Right.

01:35:59.955 --> 01:36:01.684
You see Angela today?

01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:03.815
- How come?
- No bra.

01:36:07.329 --> 01:36:08.956
I swear to God.

01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:12.832
That's unhealthy. They're gonna sag
when she gets older.

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:14.094
Fuck 'em up.

01:36:14.202 --> 01:36:16.170
So go tell her, Nick.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:17.499
What?

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.505
Go tell her.

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.371
Yeah, maybe she doesn't know.

01:36:22.477 --> 01:36:25.173
- You know, you'd be doing her a favor.
- Yeah.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.804
A true favor.

01:36:26.915 --> 01:36:28.212
Yeah.

01:36:57.612 --> 01:36:59.580
Look who dropped by for a visit.

01:37:03.451 --> 01:37:04.918
Girls.

01:37:06.254 --> 01:37:07.619
Young women.

01:37:10.425 --> 01:37:12.859
Female human beings.

01:37:15.130 --> 01:37:17.496
Female hearts beating beneath...

01:37:17.599 --> 01:37:19.328
those tight sweaters.

01:37:19.434 --> 01:37:22.699
Feminine blood
coursing through their veins.

01:37:22.804 --> 01:37:26.399
Living, breathing girls.

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:31.312
What are you young men in the
prime of your lives doing about this?

01:37:31.413 --> 01:37:33.176
I'm doing plenty.

01:37:33.281 --> 01:37:35.321
- Yeah? You're getting plenty of action?
- Oh, yeah.

01:37:35.383 --> 01:37:37.078
He has to beat 'em off
with a stick.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:41.952
Unfortunately, I'm not talking about
"whack-off.com," okay?

01:37:42.057 --> 01:37:44.753
I'm talking about
the girls in this room.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:46.884
I'm talking about communicating.

01:37:46.995 --> 01:37:48.553
I'm talking about engaging.

01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:51.188
I'm talking about
standing up from this...

01:37:52.834 --> 01:37:56.998
guys-only, Star Trek-convention,
frankly, homoerotic little group...

01:37:58.273 --> 01:38:00.639
and introducing yourself
to one of these girls.

01:38:00.742 --> 01:38:02.642
Yeah, but I always get so nervous.

01:38:02.744 --> 01:38:05.008
Why? There's nothing at stake.

01:38:05.113 --> 01:38:07.240
If there was a chance of you
actually getting laid...

01:38:07.348 --> 01:38:09.077
then you'd have
a reason to be nervous.

01:38:09.184 --> 01:38:11.084
Try working someone in a bar
for three hours...

01:38:11.186 --> 01:38:14.314
and then you gotta close the deal
right before last call.

01:38:14.422 --> 01:38:16.390
That's pressure. Okay?

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:19.659
You guys can treat this
like it's a warm-up.

01:38:20.695 --> 01:38:23.528
You're trying to fiind your style.
So you get nervous?

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:26.600
Maybe you're the nervous guy.
Maybe that's your hook.

01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:29.499
So go ahead and blush.
Stutter all you want.

01:38:30.305 --> 01:38:32.535
Show her
how she makes you feel.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.835
Think of it. You're combining
honesty and flattery.

01:38:34.943 --> 01:38:36.774
- That's lethal.
- Yeah, but...

01:38:36.878 --> 01:38:39.346
you can't let a girl know
how nervous you are.

01:38:39.447 --> 01:38:41.677
You gotta let her know
you're in control, right?

01:38:43.818 --> 01:38:45.547
"In control"?
Who is this guy?

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:48.019
You're in high school. You don't
control any... Look at your face.

01:38:48.123 --> 01:38:50.216
Look at what you're eating,
for Christ's sake.

01:38:50.325 --> 01:38:52.190
Look at that shirt.

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:53.726
In control.

01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:56.223
All right.

01:38:56.331 --> 01:38:58.371
Who's the one you guys
are all desperate to talk to?

01:38:58.399 --> 01:38:59.423
Angela.

01:39:00.468 --> 01:39:01.468
Defiinitely.

01:39:03.705 --> 01:39:06.538
- Angela.
- Okay. Here's what you could say.

01:39:09.043 --> 01:39:11.238
Hi, Angela.
My name is... What is it?

01:39:11.346 --> 01:39:13.371
- Darren.
- My name is Darren.

01:39:15.884 --> 01:39:18.876
Every time I see you in the hall,
I have the urge to talk to you.

01:39:19.587 --> 01:39:21.851
So I try to think
of something clever to say...

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:24.151
but I get so nervous...

01:39:26.094 --> 01:39:28.460
that nothing comes out.

01:39:28.563 --> 01:39:31.794
We don't know each other right now,
but I'd like to maybe...

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:35.492
invite you out for a soda sometime
so that we could talk.

01:39:35.603 --> 01:39:37.571
I'd like to see
what we have in common.

01:39:38.573 --> 01:39:40.734
But most of all,
I'm curious to fiind out...

01:39:40.842 --> 01:39:42.810
what kind of person
you really are...

01:39:42.911 --> 01:39:45.573
because I am tired
of looking at you from a dist...

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.580
And so on and so forth.

01:39:47.682 --> 01:39:49.582
Take that out for a spin.
See how it works.

01:39:49.684 --> 01:39:52.244
Yeah. See her turn around
and walk back to the jock table.

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:53.911
- Yeah.
- If that happens...

01:39:54.022 --> 01:39:56.022
you go to sleep
knowing you gave it your best shot.

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:57.990
Remember, she has to
show you something as well.

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.119
I'd love it
if Angela showed me something.

01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:05.055
- Yeah. Two things.
- Yeah!

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:07.934
I'd lick 'em.

01:40:09.971 --> 01:40:12.667
Well, I tried.
Hang in there, Nick.

01:40:12.774 --> 01:40:14.036
Wait. You're going?

01:40:14.142 --> 01:40:16.736
Yeah, I gotta get home,
look for work.

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:18.744
As we speak,
consumers everywhere need reminding...

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:20.780
of just how fat
and unattractive they are.

01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:24.451
Nice meeting you, men.

01:40:25.153 --> 01:40:26.780
Keep your sense of humor.

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:30.946
In ten years, you won't even remember
what this place looks like. Trust me.

01:40:35.563 --> 01:40:37.531
Dude, your uncle is strange.

01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:40.266
Yeah, I know.
I guess he is.

01:40:40.368 --> 01:40:42.233
Yeah, but he's cool.
You gonna visit him again?

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:46.803
I don't know.

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:52.175
What?

01:40:55.583 --> 01:40:56.777
What?

01:40:59.387 --> 01:41:00.877
Hey, Nick.

01:41:00.989 --> 01:41:03.287
Some guy, I guess
he's your uncle...

01:41:03.391 --> 01:41:05.655
he said you had
something to tell me.

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:11.430
He said it would
"blow my mind."
