WEBVTT

00:03.273 --> 00:05.173
We have a meeting with
an Emmy-winning writer.

00:05.207 --> 00:07.359
- I don't do dramas.
- And I don't do comedy.

00:07.394 --> 00:10.654
Read it. If you like it,
I'll write some more.

00:10.689 --> 00:13.027
You are running
out of cash, and fast.

00:13.062 --> 00:15.472
I sank every dollar
I had into this, Marvin.

00:15.506 --> 00:17.042
I want to ask you a question.

00:17.076 --> 00:19.647
I'm going to be looking for someone
else to run the tv department.

00:19.682 --> 00:22.953
- I don't think you need to.
- No.

00:22.987 --> 00:25.054
Hey, is that E? Tell him how we
might have found your next script.

00:25.089 --> 00:27.458
- What's he sayin'?
- He's got a potential movie for me.

00:27.492 --> 00:30.597
- Ari, I'm not satisfied.
- I'm not the man who's gonna satisfy you.

00:30.632 --> 00:32.334
- She quit.
- John Stamos?

00:32.368 --> 00:36.173
The network loves him.
They said if he's in, they're in.

00:36.208 --> 00:38.310
- John Stamos may be my co-star.
- Ooh!

00:38.345 --> 00:40.113
I got a way we could
both make some money.

00:40.147 --> 00:41.282
Come down to Mexico with me.

00:41.317 --> 00:43.752
I double-dare you to arm
wrestle me for Vince.

00:43.787 --> 00:46.556
You wanna hit me as hard as you can?
If I do that, then what?

00:46.590 --> 00:48.090
Uh-hh!

00:48.124 --> 00:49.926
Oh no!

02:13.897 --> 02:16.232
Hey, E.
What brings you here?

02:16.266 --> 02:18.802
Sloan release you
from the marital stockade?

02:18.836 --> 02:21.638
I just came by to make sure drama was
all set for his meeting with Stamos.

02:21.672 --> 02:23.840
- You brought my lucky shirt.
- You get his laundry now?

02:23.875 --> 02:26.310
<i>- Wow, you really are his manager.
- I didn't get his laundry.</i>

02:26.345 --> 02:28.446
I stopped by his house because
I was there and he forgot it.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.383
Your selflessness will pay off, because this
lucky shirt will officially seal the deal.

02:32.417 --> 02:35.285
You're not really nervous about
this meeting, are you, Johnny?

02:35.320 --> 02:36.687
Yeah, bro, of course I am.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.722
That's why I thought
I'd host him here.

02:38.757 --> 02:41.525
And maybe you could meet him
and he could see the place

02:41.560 --> 02:43.227
<i>And really get a feel
for what I'm all about.</i>

02:43.261 --> 02:45.629
You can show him you can play the
ugly brother in real life too.

02:45.664 --> 02:47.665
Is that cool, bro?

02:47.699 --> 02:49.933
- Of course it is.
- Thanks, bro.

02:49.968 --> 02:52.569
- I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss this.
- Mmm, yeah, but unfortunately

02:52.604 --> 02:54.805
You'll be in Mexico,
not getting laid.

02:54.839 --> 02:56.640
<i>- Another hater.
- Not at all.</i>

02:56.674 --> 02:58.809
I wish you the best.
I gotta go to the staff meeting.

02:58.843 --> 03:00.510
- Knock 'em dead, drama.
- All right, bro.

03:00.545 --> 03:03.246
Hey, E, you gonna find time to
read that "air-walker" script?

03:03.280 --> 03:06.048
- I'll read it after the staff meeting.
- I already read it.

03:06.083 --> 03:08.784
It's pretty good.
A little darker than "Aquaman,"

03:08.819 --> 03:11.720
But still very cool.
Lavin agrees.

03:13.390 --> 03:16.693
- What? - You never read
anything I give you that fast.

03:16.727 --> 03:19.463
Aw, someone's jealous
of Scotty Lavin.

03:19.498 --> 03:21.399
I'm not jealous of him.
I just don't like the guy.

03:21.433 --> 03:23.768
Maybe it's the dueling
napoleonic complexes?

03:23.802 --> 03:26.837
- E may be a little taller.
- Yeah, but Scotty's a little better-looking.

03:26.871 --> 03:29.039
- You think? - It's like you
and Stamos... it's a fact.

03:29.073 --> 03:31.208
<i>- It's not an opinion.
No, the fact is</i>

03:31.242 --> 03:34.211
That two dudes with no pussy are talking
about two other dudes' looks and it's weird.

03:34.245 --> 03:36.746
It is a little weird.
Still, read it!

03:36.781 --> 03:38.615
<i>I don't care
if you don't like him.</i>

03:38.649 --> 03:41.084
It could be big.

03:42.286 --> 03:43.886
Casey wasserman,
Jeff Katzenberg,

03:43.921 --> 03:45.855
Mike Meldman and John Ellis
have all confirmed

03:45.889 --> 03:47.990
For your N.F.L. Pitch,
which brings the count to 20.

03:48.025 --> 03:49.759
Billionaire boys club day,
I love it.

03:49.793 --> 03:52.161
You make sure that you get all their
favorite food and drinks ready.

03:52.195 --> 03:54.063
I got lobster salad
from sable's for Ellis,

03:54.097 --> 03:55.998
A pastrami
from Nate 'n al's for Casey

03:56.032 --> 03:57.633
And tana's veal parm
for Meldman.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.601
But I couldn't find out
what Katzenberg likes to eat.

03:59.636 --> 04:01.403
He lives off diet coke.
You see how lean he is?

04:01.437 --> 04:04.106
I need a "kung fu panda" bear
somewhere where he can see it.

04:04.140 --> 04:06.074
Okay, I've got the diet coke.

04:06.109 --> 04:08.443
I need more of it... in
those glass retro bottles.

04:08.477 --> 04:12.046
I need at least a $20-million
commitment from each one of those guys.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.248
Everything high-class
and highly enticing.

04:15.282 --> 04:18.017
Ari, you don't have to be nervous.
You're gonna do great.

04:18.052 --> 04:19.986
- What are you, my life coach?
- No, I just...

04:20.019 --> 04:23.055
Listen, don't try to get intimate with me, Jake.
It makes me uncomfortable.

04:23.089 --> 04:25.891
<i>- Okay.
- What is she still doing here?</i>

04:25.925 --> 04:28.593
- Did she unquit?
- I believe she's just packing up.

04:28.627 --> 04:30.828
- Should I call security?
- No no, I'll speak to her.

04:30.863 --> 04:33.230
- Is that wise?
- Send them off with sweetness, Jake.

04:33.264 --> 04:36.433
Hopefully you won't have to
taste my sugar anytime soon.

04:36.467 --> 04:39.369
- Yeah, let's hope.
- Lizzie, can I talk to you for a second?

04:39.403 --> 04:43.539
- About what, Ari? - I was hoping
that we could part on good terms.

04:43.573 --> 04:45.741
you can
go fuck yourself, Ari.

04:45.775 --> 04:49.144
Now is that nice? I'm preparing a
nice severance package for you.

04:49.178 --> 04:51.779
- Wow. - You don't want me angry
when I'm writing you a check?

04:51.814 --> 04:53.614
No, I don't.
What I want you to do

04:53.649 --> 04:56.316
Is shove that severance
package up your fucking ass.

04:56.350 --> 04:58.617
<i>- If you were my daughter...
- If I was your daughter</i>

04:58.651 --> 05:00.818
I would blow
my fucking brains out.

05:00.853 --> 05:03.687
Look, Ari, you might think I'm
some sort of cute little pushover,

05:03.721 --> 05:07.157
But you screwed me and I am going to
do everything I can to pay you back.

05:07.191 --> 05:08.991
Is it that time of the month
for you, Lizzie?

05:09.026 --> 05:11.827
Because I think that your
hormones are making your brain

05:11.861 --> 05:14.195
Forget who you are threatening.

05:14.229 --> 05:17.497
You don't scare me, Ari,
not even a little bit.

05:19.266 --> 05:21.834
- Did you hear that?
- I heard the polite version this morning.

05:21.868 --> 05:24.603
- I hope you said what I said.
- I said it politely.

05:29.074 --> 05:31.075
- Morning.
- Sloan sent over

05:31.109 --> 05:33.477
Some pictures of flower
centerpieces for you to go over.

05:33.512 --> 05:35.279
<i>I promised
I'd run it by you.</i>

05:35.313 --> 05:38.315
Sorry, I can't do it.
I've got to finish reading this script.

05:38.349 --> 05:40.083
- Anything good?
- Yeah, real good.

05:40.117 --> 05:42.985
- So why do you sound so upset?
- Because Lavin found it.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.854
Yeech.
Did you disinfect it?

05:44.888 --> 05:47.756
Yeah. It's for Vince.
There could be a huge franchise in this.

05:47.791 --> 05:50.759
- I just don't know what to do.
- If it's good, what's there to do?

05:50.793 --> 05:54.528
- He's got his own clients.
- Tell him he did good and you'll take it from here.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.697
- Kill him with kindness.
- Keep your enemies close.

05:57.731 --> 05:59.832
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah, I've got a couple.

05:59.866 --> 06:01.567
Do me a favor...
look through these pictures

06:01.601 --> 06:02.968
Sloan sent and pick
the ones you like?

06:03.002 --> 06:05.170
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

06:05.204 --> 06:07.905
Ha, probably not.
Leave it on my desk.

06:10.442 --> 06:12.910
- Yo, Scott.
- Jesus fucking Christ, Eric.

06:12.944 --> 06:14.811
Don't be afraid to knock, okay?

06:14.845 --> 06:17.213
Sometimes I like to start
my day off with a nice whack.

06:17.247 --> 06:20.415
- You have a glass office.
- Yeah, I mentally block that out.

06:22.118 --> 06:25.019
- The script's good.
- Excuse me, it's good?

06:25.053 --> 06:27.921
Get the fuck outta here!
It's great and you know it.

06:27.956 --> 06:30.457
<i>- Come on! - The script's great.
Good work, Scott.</i>

06:30.491 --> 06:32.825
<i>- I'll set a meeting.
- I've already done that.</i>

06:32.860 --> 06:34.794
It's for this Thursday.
We're good.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.896
You already set a meeting?
I hadn't read the script yet.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.297
I knew you were gonna love it.
It's all on the page, babe.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.332
Ari's gotta weigh in too.
You realize that, right?

06:41.367 --> 06:45.403
I already sent it to Ari and he's
burned a day by not responding.

06:45.437 --> 06:48.705
So why don't you let Ari conquer
at&t or whatever he's trying to do,

06:48.740 --> 06:50.440
And let's you and I run Vince?

06:50.475 --> 06:53.843
We've been over this, Scott.
You and I don't run Vince.

06:53.878 --> 06:56.112
<i>- I run Vince.
- You are unbelievable.</i>

06:56.146 --> 06:58.714
Are you really worried that
I'm gonna steal your client?

06:58.749 --> 07:01.216
He's not just my client, he's my best
friend since I'm five years old.

07:01.251 --> 07:03.285
Oh, so you're worried I'm
gonna steal your best friend?

07:03.319 --> 07:04.786
I'm worried you're gonna
steal my best friend.

07:04.821 --> 07:06.454
<i>You can't compete
with me there, Eric!</i>

07:06.489 --> 07:08.423
I'm way more fun than you are.
I'm single.

07:08.457 --> 07:11.092
<i>You are old
and an almost-married man.</i>

07:11.126 --> 07:13.627
- Let youth be served!
- Will you listen to yourself?

07:13.661 --> 07:16.162
You're such an idiot.
I'm trying to be polite, Scott,

07:16.196 --> 07:18.696
But it's getting harder and harder.
Stay out of my way.

07:18.731 --> 07:21.365
- Or what? - Or I'll knock
your teeth down your throat.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.868
Come here, come here! I want to bounce
you on my knee, babe. Come here!

07:24.903 --> 07:28.105
<i>We'd like to remind you to
turn off all electronic devices...</i>

07:28.139 --> 07:31.307
So shouldn't you be briefing me
on this business or something?

07:31.341 --> 07:34.276
I'm not a good salesman.
I wouldn't do it justice.

07:34.310 --> 07:36.611
You got me on the plane to
Mexico and I have no clue why.

07:36.645 --> 07:39.680
- I'd say you're pretty good.
- Well, you're obsessed with me,

07:39.715 --> 07:42.149
So I knew that part
wouldn't be hard.

07:42.183 --> 07:44.251
I'm not obsessed with you.

07:44.285 --> 07:46.486
You try to make out with me
every chance you get.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.954
I already apologized
for misreading that situation.

07:48.989 --> 07:52.190
- I'm just kidding.
- So we're ready to joke about it?

07:52.224 --> 07:54.425
- I think so.
- That's progress.

07:54.459 --> 07:57.127
So what, you gonna try
and make out with me again?

07:57.162 --> 07:59.362
No, I came here for business.

07:59.397 --> 08:02.798
Good. Because my friend's a
genius and you're gonna love him.

08:02.832 --> 08:05.167
And what does this genius
want with me?

08:05.201 --> 08:07.902
- Don't be so insecure.
- I'm serious!

08:07.936 --> 08:09.870
My business doesn't
exactly lend itself

08:09.905 --> 08:12.006
To helping some genius
boyfriend of yours.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.341
Or are you guys just planning
on holding me for ransom?

08:14.375 --> 08:16.242
Naw, you're not worth enough.

08:17.611 --> 08:19.912
- And he's n my boyfriend.
- Well, who is he?

08:19.947 --> 08:23.916
You're here for business,
so don't worry about it.

08:23.950 --> 08:26.818
Can I at least know
this genius's name?

08:26.853 --> 08:28.519
Carlos avion.

08:28.554 --> 08:31.355
- Sounds fake.
- You are jealous.

08:31.390 --> 08:33.823
Uh, no... I'm just here
for business.

08:33.857 --> 08:36.559
And why are you suddenly trying
to lure me into hitting on you?

08:36.594 --> 08:38.995
Oh, I'm sorry I am not!

08:39.030 --> 08:40.897
Okay, good.

08:40.931 --> 08:43.666
- Good.
- Then wake me when we land.

08:45.902 --> 08:47.736
Vince!
Vince, Vince.

08:47.770 --> 08:49.971
- He's here.
- Johnny, I'm here.

08:50.006 --> 08:51.840
<i>Relax, I'm coming.</i>

08:51.874 --> 08:54.209
- Hey, John, how are you?
- Good. Vince!

08:54.244 --> 08:56.246
- How are you, man?
- How are you doing?

08:56.280 --> 08:58.014
Nice to see you.
This is squanto.

08:58.048 --> 08:59.482
Welcome.
Can I get you a drink?

08:59.516 --> 09:01.884
This place is beautiful, Vince.
Beautiful.

09:01.918 --> 09:04.153
You live here too, Jimmy?

09:04.187 --> 09:06.688
Uh, no, Vince just really
enjoys my company.

09:06.723 --> 09:08.323
So I come over here
pretty often

09:08.357 --> 09:11.092
'cause Vince gets really sad
and lonely when I'm not around.

09:11.126 --> 09:13.961
- Right, bro? - Yeah, Johnny's
really great to have around.

09:13.996 --> 09:16.163
Oh, that's cool.
I hate my brother.

09:16.198 --> 09:18.465
Uh... how was Broadway?

09:18.499 --> 09:20.600
Oh, it was good.
Excellent experience.

09:20.635 --> 09:22.502
Fourth Broadway show.

09:22.536 --> 09:24.637
You know, I understudied
for chino in "west side story"

09:24.671 --> 09:26.405
- When I was 14.
- Really?

09:26.439 --> 09:29.607
Yeah, I had my first sexual experience
with the chick playing Anita.

09:29.642 --> 09:32.544
Great tits...
big giant nipples.

09:32.578 --> 09:35.880
What year was that?
My favorite cousin Angela played that role.

09:37.349 --> 09:39.283
It was off-off-broadway.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.885
- Newark.
- Aw, I'm just busting your balls.

09:41.919 --> 09:45.054
No w Angela would have fucked you.
You, she'd fuck.

09:45.089 --> 09:46.622
- Are you single?
- Currently.

09:46.657 --> 09:48.491
Maybe I'll fix you up with her.
This chick is so hot.

09:48.525 --> 09:51.627
- Oh yeah? - Yeah.
People say we look like identical twins.

09:51.661 --> 09:53.462
Let's go outside.

09:53.496 --> 09:55.563
Yeah.

09:56.932 --> 09:59.200
So have you had a chance to
look at the script, John?

09:59.234 --> 10:01.235
Oh no, not yet,
but my agent loves it.

10:01.269 --> 10:04.471
See, for me it's not about the script.
It's about us.

10:04.505 --> 10:06.973
Can we spend the next five
or 10 years together?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.574
You know, the chemistry.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.743
Oh, you have a ping-pong table?
Do you play?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.211
A little.
You?

10:12.245 --> 10:14.512
I love ping-pong, man.
It's my new obsession.

10:14.546 --> 10:16.913
I bet you get a lot of chicks
playing ping-pong, huh?

10:16.948 --> 10:19.082
Ping-pong is the new
billiards, Vince.

10:19.116 --> 10:21.718
The sport's blown up. Come on, let's play.
I'll go easy on you.

10:24.254 --> 10:27.623
You know what?
Why don't you play with Johnny?

10:27.657 --> 10:30.091
You're really better matched.
He's really good.

10:30.126 --> 10:32.226
- Oh, come on.
- What?

10:32.261 --> 10:34.161
Well, you don't have the build.

10:35.596 --> 10:38.565
<i>- Maybe I'll surprise you.
- All right, bigshot.</i>

10:38.599 --> 10:40.566
Let's rally for serve.

10:42.069 --> 10:43.669
Ping... Pong...

10:43.703 --> 10:45.704
Rally's... On!

10:45.738 --> 10:48.139
<i>- Oh!
- Whoa!</i>

10:48.174 --> 10:50.775
It's going to be a long day
for Uncle Jesse!

10:52.010 --> 10:53.310
Let's go.

10:53.344 --> 10:56.346
<i>- Come on.</i>

11:00.283 --> 11:02.250
They're ready.

11:14.528 --> 11:16.695
- Hello, everyone.
- Ari.

11:16.730 --> 11:19.565
<i>- John, how was the lobster salad?
- Nice touch, Ari.</i>

11:19.599 --> 11:22.534
- Though I am partial to sable's crab salad.
- I'll kill my assistant.

11:22.569 --> 11:23.969
He said he talked to your wife.

11:24.004 --> 11:25.437
She probable said that.
She barely knows me.

11:25.472 --> 11:27.438
Instead of your assistant, kill her.

11:27.473 --> 11:29.706
- My veal parm was excellent.
- Love to hear it, Mike.

11:29.740 --> 11:31.407
- How are you, Matthew?
- Good to see you.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.309
- Nice to see you, Mr.
Wasserman. - Ari.

11:33.343 --> 11:35.411
Shawne Merriman, a surprise.
Good to see you, sir.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.512
Hey, I'm a free agent this year.
I thought I'd sit in.

11:37.547 --> 11:39.713
- The more the Merriman.

11:39.747 --> 11:42.750
Rim-shot!
Listen, Katzenberg... where is he?

11:42.784 --> 11:44.952
<i>I am holding a large
plastic dragon.</i>

11:44.986 --> 11:47.487
This will represent Mr.
Katzenberg. How about that?

11:47.522 --> 11:50.156
<i>He will sit right here.
Down to business.</i>

11:50.191 --> 11:53.393
I want, and everyone
in this town wants,

11:53.427 --> 11:58.264
An N.F.L. Team playing in a
brand-new state-of-the-art facility

11:58.298 --> 12:00.232
Within five years, all right?

12:00.267 --> 12:02.334
<i>I think with the power
and the money at this table,</i>

12:02.369 --> 12:04.369
<i>We can
get it done in three.</i>

12:04.404 --> 12:07.772
Now is the time for L.A.
to have an N.F.L. Team,

12:07.807 --> 12:10.408
And I am the right guy to lead
the charge to make this happen.

12:10.443 --> 12:12.343
<i>What do you know
about football, Ari?</i>

12:12.377 --> 12:14.411
Don't tell me you played
in high school.

12:14.446 --> 12:16.881
I did play a little in high school.
I was pretty good for a Jew.

12:16.915 --> 12:18.916
What, were you
a field-goal kicker?

12:18.950 --> 12:21.651
<i>- I was an offensive lineman</i>

12:21.686 --> 12:24.187
And I illegally tripped
Mr. Shawne Merriman one time.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.289
Ari, you couldn't trip me
up with a shotgun.

12:26.323 --> 12:28.223
But still... how are
you gonna run a team?

12:28.258 --> 12:30.225
We put up the money
and you're in charge?

12:30.259 --> 12:33.094
Like I do here at the world's
largest talent agency,

12:33.129 --> 12:37.097
I bring in the best.
I attract the best, I've always done that.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.999
Bill Belichick is a friend.

12:39.033 --> 12:42.235
<i>When his contract is up
in new England, who knows?</i>

12:42.269 --> 12:44.136
I mean, hell, everyone
wants to live here.

12:44.171 --> 12:47.438
It is paradise. The only thing
this town doesn't have, gentlemen,

12:47.473 --> 12:48.706
Is an N.F.L. Team.

12:48.740 --> 12:51.875
All I need is the money
and I can make that happen.

12:51.909 --> 12:54.644
Barbara Miller has
committed $10 million

12:54.678 --> 12:57.279
And agreed to work for free
as the mascot.

12:57.313 --> 13:00.548
How about that... the L.A. Cougars?

13:00.583 --> 13:02.316
Everybody wins.

13:04.019 --> 13:06.319
Gentlemen, look at the packets
right in front of you.

13:06.354 --> 13:09.355
There's a great deal of information.
Sign checks... big ones.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.791
And if not, regret not being a part
of this for the rest of your lives.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.927
Why do you let this guy
get to you?

13:15.961 --> 13:19.196
I don't know. My assistant tells me I
should try to kill him with kindness,

13:19.230 --> 13:21.765
And I tried, but it's like this
guy's immune to human interaction.

13:21.799 --> 13:23.200
<i>I don't think you
should be fake.</i>

13:23.234 --> 13:25.769
I think you should just
honestly tell him how you feel.

13:25.803 --> 13:28.437
<i>- I did!
- So let it go.</i>

13:28.471 --> 13:30.872
He found a great project
for Vince.

13:30.906 --> 13:33.041
Oh, what a dick!

13:33.075 --> 13:34.675
I should be happy, right?

13:34.710 --> 13:36.576
<i>Vince won't forget
what you do for him</i>

13:36.611 --> 13:38.845
<i>No matter who gives him
a script, you know that.</i>

13:38.879 --> 13:40.847
<i>I do know that.
But I don't need this guy</i>

13:40.881 --> 13:43.215
Getting Vince jumping out
of any more planes, okay?

13:43.249 --> 13:45.383
You can't control who Vince
is friends with, babe.

13:45.418 --> 13:49.620
<i>- Yeah. - Just make sure
business is going good.</i>

13:49.655 --> 13:50.955
Yeah.

13:50.989 --> 13:54.358
- You're ignoring me.
- No, I'm not.

13:54.392 --> 13:56.693
You want me to tell Murray
to keep Scott away from Vince?

13:56.727 --> 13:58.628
No! Are you kidding?
That's my business.

13:58.662 --> 14:00.629
- I think I can handle that, Sloan.
- Okay.

14:00.664 --> 14:03.265
I would like to stick Scott next
to Murray at the wedding though.

14:03.299 --> 14:04.733
done.

14:04.767 --> 14:07.668
- Did you look at the flowers?
- Uh...

14:07.703 --> 14:11.038
Yeah yeah, I like the...

14:11.072 --> 14:12.806
Red ones.
I like the red ones.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.008
The red, huh?

14:15.043 --> 14:18.144
Look at them, please.
We're meeting with the florist tomorrow.

14:18.179 --> 14:19.779
I will, okay.
I'm sorry.

14:19.813 --> 14:21.480
- I love you.
- Thank you.

14:21.515 --> 14:23.515
<i>- Love you.
- Bye.</i>

14:23.549 --> 14:24.816
Bye.

14:26.118 --> 14:27.786
Jennie?
Will you let me know

14:27.820 --> 14:30.655
<i>When Lavin's back
from lunch, please.</i>

14:35.294 --> 14:37.561
The yankee hat
comes with me everywhere.

14:37.596 --> 14:40.330
Maybe I'll get you a sombrero
with a yankee symbol on it.

14:40.365 --> 14:42.332
Whoo!

14:42.367 --> 14:44.067
Oh, there they are.

14:48.372 --> 14:49.806
<i>Hola mamacita.</i>

14:49.840 --> 14:52.308
Hey, don't get fresh, Edgar.
I'll tell your boss.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.411
<i>- The boss is here.
- Hola.</i>

14:56.445 --> 14:59.681
<i>- Corazon. ¿como estas?
- Bien bien.</i>

14:59.715 --> 15:02.183
And you must be turtle.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

15:02.217 --> 15:04.318
I understand you can
offer us big things.

15:04.352 --> 15:07.353
<i>- In what way?
- He's funny.</i>

15:07.387 --> 15:08.888
He's nervous.

15:08.922 --> 15:11.623
Don't worry... I won't kill
you until you turn me down.

15:11.658 --> 15:13.525
<i>Get in, amigo.</i>

15:13.559 --> 15:15.594
- Why has he got a gun?
- It's Mexico.

15:15.628 --> 15:18.295
- Everyone's got a gun here.
- If I wanted to be involved in shit like this

15:18.330 --> 15:20.630
I would have went back east
to work for my Uncle Carmine.

15:20.664 --> 15:23.198
It's nothing illegal,
I promise.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.502
- What's the hold-up?
- The hold-up is where I come from,

15:27.537 --> 15:30.640
You don't get into a car with a
bunch of guys who are carrying.

15:36.346 --> 15:38.215
Here, now you are carrying too.

15:38.249 --> 15:41.383
- I just want to know what this is about.
- Do you like Tequila?

15:41.417 --> 15:43.751
- Yeah.
- That's what it's about.

15:43.786 --> 15:46.554
Tequila... the finest
in the world.

15:48.023 --> 15:50.690
Turtle, I swear
this is legitimate.

15:50.725 --> 15:52.759
- Uh...
- Just trust me.

15:52.793 --> 15:54.994
Put it away.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.934
D'oh!

16:02.968 --> 16:05.402
<i>- Whew! 10-2.
- I can count.</i>

16:05.437 --> 16:07.704
It ain't over yet.

16:14.243 --> 16:17.112
Oh!
It is now, son.

16:18.447 --> 16:20.414
Good game, John.

16:20.448 --> 16:22.883
I gotta split.
I got another meeting.

16:22.917 --> 16:25.218
Do you want to talk
about the show?

16:25.253 --> 16:27.487
I'll talk to Phil.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.995
Why would you embarrass a guy
who you want something from?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.663
<i>I didn't mean
to embarrass him!</i>

16:38.697 --> 16:40.764
He's got a Korean girl that
trains him three times a week.

16:40.798 --> 16:43.999
<i>- He's got a ping-pong trainer?
- Yes, John, and you beat him.</i>

16:44.033 --> 16:46.001
When I play, I play to win.

16:46.035 --> 16:47.837
John's a notoriously
bad loser to start with.

16:47.871 --> 16:50.237
- I didn't know that either!
- I beat him at golf once,

16:50.272 --> 16:51.571
He didn't talk to me
for two years.

16:51.606 --> 16:53.273
Maybe this is something
you could have told me

16:53.307 --> 16:54.707
<i>Before the meeting, Phil.</i>

16:54.742 --> 16:57.209
I didn't know you were gonna
embarrass him, John!

16:57.244 --> 16:59.912
<i>- Maybe there's someone else we could get.
- No, John, there's not.</i>

16:59.946 --> 17:03.915
You know why? Because there's nobody
better- looking than you in this town.

17:03.950 --> 17:07.285
- Rob lowe maybe.
- The network is into this guy.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.787
They like Stamos...
no, they love Stamos.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.123
He was excited.
So call his agent,

17:12.156 --> 17:15.626
<i>Call his house, call whoever you
need to and figure out a way</i>

17:15.660 --> 17:18.028
To smooth this out...
Or don't.

17:25.167 --> 17:27.102
Lavin's back.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.580
Oh, look at that!
He knocks like a gentleman.

17:39.614 --> 17:43.016
listen, Scott, the
only thing that's important to me

17:43.050 --> 17:46.318
Is Vince's career.
"air-walker" is amazing.

17:46.352 --> 17:48.420
Thank you.

17:49.622 --> 17:51.923
- Was that an apology?
- Was that not clear?

17:51.957 --> 17:54.191
Not really.
I mean, it wasn't crystal clear.

17:54.226 --> 17:56.360
- You didn't say sorry
or anything... - Ahem!

17:56.394 --> 17:58.128
Hey, oh hey!

17:58.162 --> 18:00.163
Listen, I appreciate it, okay?

18:00.197 --> 18:03.599
I appreciate it and I am a big
enough man to say I'm sorry as well.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.301
- For what?
- For being a dick.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.237
- Today or every day?
- Since you started here I have been a dick.

18:08.271 --> 18:10.472
- Yeah. - I was bitter
about the way you came in

18:10.507 --> 18:12.207
With Vince as your star client,

18:12.241 --> 18:14.809
You know, and your girlfriend's
connection to the boss,

18:14.844 --> 18:17.512
But I see that you are a good dude
and you are good at what you do.

18:17.546 --> 18:18.846
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.482
Hopefully you have noticed
the same about me.

18:21.516 --> 18:24.384
- I have.
- Listen,

18:24.418 --> 18:26.653
We are the future of this company.
Look, this guy,

18:26.687 --> 18:28.154
He doesn't even
show up anymore.

18:28.188 --> 18:30.189
- He's too busy servicing models.
- Exactly.

18:30.223 --> 18:33.191
So it could just be us
and we should stick together.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.926
Pffft!

18:35.961 --> 18:38.361
I'm kidding.
I'm... come on.

18:38.396 --> 18:40.096
No hug.

19:00.615 --> 19:02.817
<i>Atencion, atencion!</i>

19:02.851 --> 19:06.388
Please, everyone,
enjoy this special day.

19:06.422 --> 19:08.090
Y tomen mucho...

19:08.124 --> 19:10.558
<i>- ...Y mas.</i>

19:10.592 --> 19:12.660
<i>To the future!</i>

19:14.929 --> 19:16.896
- To the future.
- To the future.

19:18.132 --> 19:19.700
- Mm.
- Mm.

19:19.734 --> 19:20.901
- Whoa.
- So?

19:20.935 --> 19:23.303
- You like it?
- It's incredible.

19:23.337 --> 19:25.972
- I am a little fucked up though.
- You're such a lightweight.

19:26.006 --> 19:29.174
I had eight shots. Are you trying to get
me drunk so you can take advantage of me?

19:29.209 --> 19:32.444
'cause I don't have to be
drunk for you to do that.

19:32.479 --> 19:34.746
Turtle.

19:34.780 --> 19:37.849
Would you just kiss me already
and stop the bullshit?

19:40.552 --> 19:42.819
- What, is it that Carlos guy?
- Are you kidding?

19:42.853 --> 19:44.886
I told you,
he's an old family friend.

19:44.921 --> 19:47.054
- He is old.
- Stop it!

19:47.088 --> 19:48.555
- He is.
- Turtle.

19:48.589 --> 19:51.357
- You like it?
- Your father created this?

19:51.391 --> 19:55.260
Making the finest Tequila in all of
Mexico was my father's life's work.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.429
Now it is mine.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.231
Walk with me.
Alex, excuse us a moment, please.

20:07.137 --> 20:09.539
My father, may he rest
in peace, has gone,

20:09.573 --> 20:11.974
And I want the world
to taste his creation.

20:12.009 --> 20:13.809
Me too.
What's it called?

20:13.843 --> 20:15.643
He named it in honor
of our family.

20:15.678 --> 20:18.913
<i>- Tequila avion.
- Gracias.</i>

20:18.947 --> 20:20.047
<i>De nada.</i>

20:20.082 --> 20:22.049
Tomorrow, I will take you
to the place

20:22.083 --> 20:24.484
Where my father first
began production in 1948,

20:24.518 --> 20:27.353
- Where we still produce it today.
- I'd love to see that.

20:27.387 --> 20:29.421
But tonight we celebrate.

20:29.455 --> 20:32.323
Any girls you have
your eyes on?

20:32.357 --> 20:34.358
Making love on avion
is unmatched.

20:34.393 --> 20:38.063
To be honest, Carlos, I kinda
only have my eye on Alex.

20:40.067 --> 20:42.101
- Alex is like a daughter to me.
- No no no.

20:42.136 --> 20:44.303
I didn't mean to bang.
I'm a nice guy, Carlos.

20:44.337 --> 20:46.538
That remains to be seen.

20:46.572 --> 20:48.072
I tell you what...

20:48.107 --> 20:51.944
You deliver for me, I will do
my best to deliver to you.

20:51.978 --> 20:54.045
What do I need to deliver?

20:54.080 --> 20:56.480
I need a face
for my family's Tequila.

20:56.515 --> 20:59.149
You want mine?

20:59.184 --> 21:01.618
- No.
- What then?

21:01.652 --> 21:04.020
Alex tells me that you
are very close friends

21:04.055 --> 21:05.722
With Vincent chase.

21:10.259 --> 21:12.360
Aquaman and avion...

21:12.395 --> 21:14.596
A match made in heaven.

21:16.298 --> 21:18.532
Jeffrey, I'm sorry that
you couldn't make it,

21:18.567 --> 21:20.401
But I'm going to send gallons
of diet coke

21:20.435 --> 21:22.302
Over to you as
soon as I get your check.

21:22.337 --> 21:24.638
Make it out to "cash."

21:26.407 --> 21:29.175
That... it's gonna be
a great year thanks to you.

21:29.209 --> 21:31.377
Thank you, my friend.
Yeah, baby!

21:31.411 --> 21:34.313
- More good news? - Call my wife.
I may even take her to dinner.

21:34.347 --> 21:37.082
- All right. - Yeah, and you
go to dinner as well... on me.

21:37.116 --> 21:38.816
- Really?
- Yeah, you got a girl?

21:38.850 --> 21:41.452
- Not right now.
- You want cash for a hooker? Either way.

21:41.486 --> 21:43.153
- I'll just call your wife.
- All right.

21:43.187 --> 21:45.288
Ari gold's office.

21:45.322 --> 21:47.256
Just a second.

21:48.458 --> 21:49.825
Andrew klein.

21:49.859 --> 21:51.392
Jesus.
Stay for this.

21:51.427 --> 21:54.195
This is the guy who missed the boat.
Learn how not to.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.097
Andrew!

21:56.131 --> 21:57.798
<i>What a tragic time
for you to be calling.</i>

21:57.832 --> 22:00.500
<i>I just landed an NFL
team in Los Angeles.</i>

22:00.534 --> 22:02.835
And if you didn't blow your
entire career up your nose,

22:02.869 --> 22:05.204
You'd be banging cheerleaders
up in a luxury box with us.

22:05.238 --> 22:07.539
I appreciate your support
in my recovery, Ari,

22:07.573 --> 22:10.175
But I don't live with regrets.
I've been taught to be at peace

22:10.209 --> 22:13.645
<i>- With the choices I've made.
- So you're on the making- amends step?</i>

22:13.679 --> 22:15.713
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to make amends for this.

22:15.748 --> 22:17.715
<i>I bribed an orderly
for his cell phone.</i>

22:17.749 --> 22:19.915
- Why, what's up?
- Hey.

22:19.949 --> 22:22.984
- God damn it.
- Right.

22:24.586 --> 22:27.921
Lizzie's making moves.
She's after our client...

22:27.956 --> 22:29.957
We, your clients.

22:29.992 --> 22:31.692
Come on!
What does she have to offer?

22:31.727 --> 22:34.660
She's got someone big behind her.
C.A.A. Maybe.

22:34.695 --> 22:36.829
<i>- But she's making promises.
- How do you even know?</i>

22:36.863 --> 22:39.632
Half the town is in here with me
and they've got phone privileges.

22:39.666 --> 22:42.201
Andrew klein, you need to get
your ass off that telephone.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.369
Klein, get off the phone.
Follow the rules.

22:44.403 --> 22:46.104
- Give me a second.
- Hang it up!

22:46.138 --> 22:48.073
all right, bye for now, Ari.

22:48.107 --> 22:50.107
Hey, klein, you know why
I fired you as an agent?

22:50.142 --> 22:51.842
'cause your punk-ass
never listened.

22:51.876 --> 22:54.477
- Barbara!
- Is this about Lizzie?

22:54.512 --> 22:56.712
- How did you know?
- I heard.

22:56.747 --> 22:58.380
- Where's her list?
- Check your email.

22:58.414 --> 23:01.448
I'm already making calls
and I suggest you do the same.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.023
Wow, was he
this good this morning?

23:12.057 --> 23:14.224
I guess he's been working
with his trainer.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.026
Hey, John!

23:16.060 --> 23:18.194
The stroke's looking better.

23:18.229 --> 23:20.529
What the fuck
are you doing here?

23:20.564 --> 23:22.598
Your agent told me
where I could find you.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.334
- Good to see you again, Vince.
- You too.

23:25.368 --> 23:26.935
- Impressive stuff.
- Yeah, thanks.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.970
Soo Yeon is the best.
And this is Ellie.

23:29.004 --> 23:31.338
Anytime you want
a lesson, let me know.

23:31.372 --> 23:34.207
- Will do.
- John, I came to resolve our...

23:34.241 --> 23:36.208
<i>- Little conflict.
- Conflict?</i>

23:36.243 --> 23:39.412
What, about the show?
We have no conflict.

23:39.446 --> 23:42.316
- We just have no chemistry.
- Come on, John.

23:42.350 --> 23:44.818
We didn't even get to know
each other's chemistry

23:44.853 --> 23:47.555
'cause you got mad
that I beat you.

23:47.589 --> 23:49.790
He beat you?

23:49.825 --> 23:51.458
Yeah, can you believe it?

23:51.492 --> 23:52.592
No.

23:53.928 --> 23:55.428
I didn't have my paddle.

23:55.462 --> 23:57.363
If we played here
and you had your paddle,

23:57.398 --> 23:59.799
I'm 100% sure you would
have kicked my ass.

24:03.403 --> 24:05.270
What, are you
patronizing me here?

24:05.304 --> 24:06.571
What?
No no.

24:06.606 --> 24:08.640
Then play me right now
and I will kick your ass.

24:08.674 --> 24:11.308
I'm a little worn out
from earlier.

24:13.178 --> 24:15.779
Johnny,

24:15.813 --> 24:17.947
You're a bitch, you know that?

24:19.149 --> 24:21.283
A real pussy.

24:21.317 --> 24:24.486
You're all calm, cool,
collected on your home court

24:24.520 --> 24:26.921
With your shitty-ass table
in the grass

24:26.955 --> 24:29.657
And your fucked-up paddles and
come stains all over your table...

24:29.691 --> 24:31.091
- Sorry, Vince.
- Eh.

24:31.126 --> 24:33.927
But here? You don't give a
man a chance at payback?

24:33.961 --> 24:36.695
You have come stains on your table?
That's gross.

24:36.730 --> 24:39.898
Look, John, you got
your trainer here and all,

24:39.932 --> 24:42.533
But I've been playing this
game since I was a little kid,

24:42.568 --> 24:44.735
So you shouldn't feel bad
that I beat you.

24:44.770 --> 24:47.104
You beat me right now
and I'll do your tv show.

24:49.073 --> 24:50.373
- Really?
- Ye.

24:50.408 --> 24:52.609
Okay.

24:52.643 --> 24:55.812
But I'm gonna need
to change my clothes.

24:55.846 --> 24:57.646
Be right back.

24:57.681 --> 24:59.448
Work my backhand, Soo.

24:59.482 --> 25:01.483
He really beat you?

25:01.518 --> 25:03.652
Turtle, why do
you want to leave?

25:03.686 --> 25:06.054
We're supposed to go see
the factory in the morning.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.222
I've seen enough.
You can stay if you want.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.324
what's your problem?

25:10.358 --> 25:13.726
- I don't have a problem.
- You're acting like an asshole out of the blue,

25:13.761 --> 25:17.096
So it's either 'cause I wouldn't kiss
you before or you're just a mean drunk.

25:17.130 --> 25:20.466
- I'm not drunk anymore.
- Well, I'm still a little drunk,

25:20.500 --> 25:23.268
So if you ever had a shot
at me, it would be now.

25:23.302 --> 25:25.570
- You're a real tease, you
know that, Alex? - What?

25:25.604 --> 25:27.404
<i>Yeah, maybe that's why
I hit on you the first time.</i>

25:27.439 --> 25:30.707
You kept putting it out there, but
I didn't realize you had a motive.

25:30.741 --> 25:32.775
- What motive?
- To get Vince.

25:32.810 --> 25:34.377
What the hell
else am I doing here?

25:34.411 --> 25:36.078
- Turtle... - You should
have asked me in L.A.

25:36.113 --> 25:38.747
- I could have saved you the time.
- I knew you wouldn't have come.

25:38.781 --> 25:41.950
But I thought once you saw everything,
you'd see how real this is.

25:41.984 --> 25:45.520
- You should have invited Vince.
- I wanted to come with you.

25:45.555 --> 25:47.555
I don't know if I believe that.

25:47.590 --> 25:49.224
You would if I fucked
you though, right?

25:49.258 --> 25:51.693
- It'd be a start.
- I'm not that easy.

25:51.727 --> 25:54.628
Are you interested in me or not?
Because I don't got time for games.

25:54.663 --> 25:57.030
I'm getting there,
but this is real, turtle.

25:57.065 --> 26:00.534
And no one's going to get used.
But if it all works out, then maybe we'll all get rich.

26:00.568 --> 26:03.002
- Vince is already rich.
- Maybe he'll get richer then.

26:03.037 --> 26:05.171
But I'm not,
and I don't know about you...

26:05.205 --> 26:07.106
I got $1700 to my name.

26:07.140 --> 26:09.341
So stay tonight.
Sleep on it.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.576
Then we'll go to the
factory in the morning.

26:11.610 --> 26:14.144
It'll blow you away.

26:14.178 --> 26:17.047
Are we sleeping on it together?

26:17.081 --> 26:20.251
I don't want you to think
I did it for the wrong reasons.

26:20.285 --> 26:23.354
I don't care why you do it.

26:27.358 --> 26:30.058
Yes!

26:32.963 --> 26:34.930
Oh, would you look at this.

26:34.965 --> 26:36.064
Yeah, we...
we made up.

26:36.099 --> 26:38.433
<i>- We're paisanos now.
- Hey, way to be mature.</i>

26:38.467 --> 26:40.968
<i>- What's going on here?
- Oh, it's not good.</i>

26:41.002 --> 26:44.370
<i>- He's kicking Johnny's ass.
- I thought drama was better than him.</i>

26:44.404 --> 26:45.504
No he's not.

26:45.539 --> 26:48.406
Aha ha ha!

26:48.441 --> 26:50.841
10-6, match point.

26:52.077 --> 26:54.611
It looks like your boy
is going down in flames.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.746
Play to his backhand.
It's very weak.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.448
What the fuck did she just say?

26:58.482 --> 27:00.450
It's not that weak,
Soo, thank you.

27:00.484 --> 27:02.853
- Let's go.
- Come on, Johnny!

27:06.424 --> 27:07.858
Yeah, come on.

27:14.264 --> 27:15.231
No-ooo!

27:15.265 --> 27:16.899
No no, you motherfucking...

27:16.933 --> 27:19.501
Your brother's the John
McEnroe of ping-pong.

27:20.702 --> 27:23.036
still say
it ain't the paddle?

27:23.070 --> 27:24.970
- Great game, John.
- Thanks.

27:25.005 --> 27:27.773
I say you're much better
than I thought you were.

27:29.242 --> 27:32.277
- You hustled me, didn't you?
- Are you a sore loser, John?

27:32.311 --> 27:35.713
- I don't like being played.
- Hey, I didn't hustle you!

27:35.748 --> 27:39.083
You beat me before and I beat
you right now, honest to God.

27:39.984 --> 27:41.685
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.954
So I guess that's it, huh?

27:44.988 --> 27:46.922
No, actually you
have potential.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.823
It's hard to find
good competition.

27:48.857 --> 27:50.824
Maybe we could play on the set.

27:50.859 --> 27:53.260
- You'll do the show?
- Let me read the script first,

27:53.294 --> 27:54.761
- But...
- Yes yes!

27:54.795 --> 27:57.229
- I'll definitely consider it.
- You're gonna love it.

27:57.264 --> 27:59.565
- And don't forget how
much you love me. - Right.

28:01.100 --> 28:04.202
- He might do the show.
- All right!

28:04.236 --> 28:05.803
Hey, that's fantastic!

28:05.838 --> 28:09.373
You see, Johnny? Even though you
lost, he liked you for you.

28:09.407 --> 28:11.474
Please, bro, I threw that game.

28:11.508 --> 28:14.644
He's just like me... you stroke
the ego, you get what you want.

28:14.678 --> 28:16.512
- Well played.
- Thanks, man.

28:16.546 --> 28:18.580
We're all going to Vegas for the night.
I got a plane.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.882
<i>- Can I invite Stamos?
- Of course, Soo's coming.</i>

28:20.917 --> 28:24.185
Hey, John, you want to go to Vegas?
Baby bro got a plane.

28:24.220 --> 28:25.987
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Scotty, you in?

28:26.021 --> 28:27.888
I never say no
to a plane or Vegas.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.957
- E?
- Uh, no, I can't.

28:29.991 --> 28:31.591
Come on, I'm not gonna bite.

28:31.626 --> 28:34.260
We gotta take our newfound
friendship to the next level.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.229
Yeah, I wanna hang out
with both my boys.

28:36.263 --> 28:38.631
I appreciate it, but I gotta see
the wedding planner tomorrow.

28:38.665 --> 28:40.332
- Oh God!
- Getting married?

28:40.366 --> 28:42.334
- Yeah, in October.
- You poor bastard.

28:42.368 --> 28:44.402
Ah well, let's go!

28:46.271 --> 28:50.541
- Later, E. - I'll get blowed for you.
One time, all right.

28:50.575 --> 28:53.409
We probably won't have any fun.
