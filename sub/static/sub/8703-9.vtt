00:47.144 --> 00:49.143
Hey.

00:49.144 --> 00:53.304
Um, I got to tell you
something before we head off.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.184
I fucked up.

00:55.683 --> 00:56.714
Guatemala.

00:57.816 --> 01:00.304
The money, like, fees and...

01:03.584 --> 01:04.763
We're short.

01:06.522 --> 01:07.522
How much?

01:08.529 --> 01:10.402
How much are we missing?

01:12.002 --> 01:13.281
40,000.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.761
Oh, Jesus Christ, Cobi.

01:15.762 --> 01:18.761
And you didn't know about the
40,000 fucking dollars in fees?

01:18.762 --> 01:22.082
Yes, I knew about that, but
I didn't know about this.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.601
Hey, Gus.

01:30.602 --> 01:32.882
End of the road.

01:36.442 --> 01:38.681
I didn't... I didn't tell the guys.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.242
Well, we can't tell them now.

01:52.628 --> 01:53.802
Look, we can't go.

01:53.803 --> 01:55.881
We have to. All right?
We don't have a choice.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.961
We can get back in the
car and we can just go back.

01:57.962 --> 01:59.641
To where?

01:59.642 --> 02:02.362
That is the only way out.

02:07.122 --> 02:08.521
You okay?

02:09.205 --> 02:10.882
I just want to get this shit over with.

03:14.158 --> 03:15.562
Come on.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.161
Uh, we're probably just being set up

03:23.162 --> 03:24.361
like a bunch of fall guys.

03:24.362 --> 03:26.041
We're already fall guys.

03:26.042 --> 03:27.681
You think Aaron gives a shit about us?

03:27.682 --> 03:29.521
Who better to blame than four dudes

03:29.522 --> 03:31.041
already accused of murdering a cop?

03:31.042 --> 03:32.681
- Blame us for what?
- Anything.

03:32.682 --> 03:34.881
Oh, look, wrapping's coming off.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.081
Yeah, well, don't mess with it.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.521
You're gonna make it worse.

03:37.522 --> 03:38.761
Just peel it back a little bit,

03:38.762 --> 03:39.921
we could take a look what's inside.

03:39.922 --> 03:41.201
What, are you crazy?

03:41.202 --> 03:42.801
I'm not... I'm not gonna open it.

03:42.802 --> 03:43.802
I'm just gonna go... look,
it's already this far.

03:43.803 --> 03:44.881
Okay, let's vote.

03:44.882 --> 03:46.362
Who thinks we should look inside?

03:54.802 --> 03:57.082
This is a really bad idea.

03:58.922 --> 03:59.935
Wait.

04:00.562 --> 04:03.081
What if... what if
it's, like, a bio-hazard thing,

04:03.082 --> 04:04.601
like, a chemical weapon?

04:04.602 --> 04:07.161
Jesus opens it up and... he's dead,

04:07.162 --> 04:08.296
and we're dead with him.

04:08.922 --> 04:10.609
My finger's already in it.

04:11.282 --> 04:12.562
Well, you're dead.

04:20.281 --> 04:21.560
Wait, wait.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.321
It's wrapped in some kind of textile.

04:24.322 --> 04:26.841
Textile? Who says textile?

04:26.842 --> 04:28.401
What, are you John fucking Adams?

04:28.402 --> 04:29.681
You know what I mean.

04:29.682 --> 04:31.842
It's, like, a fabric, like, a cloth.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.121
All I can see is black inside.

04:37.122 --> 04:39.002
Let me see.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.682
Yeah, that can be anything, really.

04:58.922 --> 05:01.602
Welcome, thanks for coming.

05:05.122 --> 05:07.402
Ah, good to see you. Good to see you.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.962
Welcome.

05:50.676 --> 05:52.396
I'm so sorry.

05:57.742 --> 05:59.662
He deserved better.

06:52.436 --> 06:54.236
Some kind of pervert, are you?

07:16.757 --> 07:18.476
You want to take responsibility for this

07:18.477 --> 07:19.528
or you gonna keep secrets?

07:19.529 --> 07:20.864
What?

07:20.889 --> 07:23.128
You gonna tell me whose number this is?

07:23.129 --> 07:25.048
You left it on the car
seat. Guatemala City?

07:25.049 --> 07:26.888
This is the number for a hotline

07:26.889 --> 07:29.888
for our missing American embassy worker.

07:29.889 --> 07:31.408
You called it.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.409
Yes.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.409
What'd they say?

07:35.275 --> 07:36.609
I don't know.

07:36.609 --> 07:40.329
I just left a message, told
them where the car was.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.808
The woman from the embassy,

08:09.809 --> 08:11.088
the Southern coast road,

08:11.089 --> 08:15.288
about one mile past the San Pedro turnoff.

08:15.289 --> 08:18.769
She... she fell.

08:32.443 --> 08:33.609
We're supposed to go up that?

08:33.904 --> 08:35.192
This can't be right.

08:35.193 --> 08:36.808
That's what the map says.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.087
All right. Yeah. Got it.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.569
Here you go.

09:09.534 --> 09:11.253
Hey, hold up.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.729
I have a rock in my shoe.

09:13.729 --> 09:15.168
Yeah, you know, we're never gonna get there

09:15.169 --> 09:16.528
if we keep stopping.

09:16.529 --> 09:18.729
There's plenty of daylight. Just chill.

09:20.246 --> 09:21.689
The humidity's killing this thing.

09:21.689 --> 09:23.449
It's falling apart.

09:25.769 --> 09:27.288
Hey, Lex, wait up.

09:27.289 --> 09:28.688
What are we gonna do?

09:28.689 --> 09:30.328
I don't know.

09:30.329 --> 09:32.248
Well, how... how are we gonna explain it?

09:32.249 --> 09:33.385
I'm thinking.

09:33.386 --> 09:35.729
What are you whispering
about? Come on, damn!

09:37.355 --> 09:38.449
Lex!

09:56.489 --> 09:57.969
Hello?

10:00.089 --> 10:01.175
Hello?

10:20.169 --> 10:21.355
Hello?

10:27.467 --> 10:28.467
Hello?

10:33.249 --> 10:34.675
Guys, there's a woman here.

10:52.596 --> 10:53.596
Lex?

10:55.969 --> 10:57.278
- Lex!
- Lex!

10:57.636 --> 10:58.916
Lex!

10:59.049 --> 11:01.969
Guys, his bag's here.

11:07.489 --> 11:09.049
Help!

11:10.115 --> 11:11.234
- You hear that?
- Lex!

11:11.235 --> 11:12.235
Lex!

11:12.236 --> 11:13.927
Help! I'm down here!

11:15.155 --> 11:16.674
He's over here, he's over here.

11:16.675 --> 11:17.994
- Where?
- Here!

11:17.995 --> 11:19.514
- Hey, guys.
- On the ground!

11:19.515 --> 11:20.635
- Lex!
- Yes.

11:21.268 --> 11:22.995
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

11:22.995 --> 11:24.674
I saw a woman. I was following her.

11:24.675 --> 11:26.434
I fell down a fucking hole.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.994
- You need a hand?
- Don't fucking joke around.

11:28.995 --> 11:30.634
I'm claustrophobic. Get me out!

11:30.635 --> 11:32.354
- All right.
- I'm stuck.

11:32.355 --> 11:34.034
All right, all right. I got it.

11:34.035 --> 11:35.394
- Grab my arm.
- Okay.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.634
Ready? Ready? I'm just gonna pull you up.

11:37.635 --> 11:38.595
Ready?

11:38.596 --> 11:40.034
Ah, ah, ah, wait, wait, wait!

11:40.035 --> 11:41.154
- What?
- My... my foot is stuck.

11:41.155 --> 11:42.115
Just wiggle a little bit.

11:42.116 --> 11:43.560
Yeah, yeah, one, two...

11:43.561 --> 11:44.994
- Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Shit! Shit!

11:44.995 --> 11:46.434
- Don't let go!
- I got you!

11:46.435 --> 11:47.395
I got you!

11:47.396 --> 11:48.554
- Jesus!
- Whoa.

11:48.555 --> 11:49.874
- Help! Help!
- Don't let go!

11:49.875 --> 11:51.234
- I got you, I got you!
- Don't let go!

11:51.235 --> 11:53.074
I won't let go! We're not gonna drop you.

11:53.075 --> 11:54.714
I don't know how far down this goes.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.834
- Come on.
- Use your legs.

11:57.995 --> 11:59.634
Get around back!

11:59.635 --> 12:01.764
I got him!

12:01.765 --> 12:02.827
Come on.

12:02.828 --> 12:04.074
Grab him, grab him, grab him!

12:04.075 --> 12:05.554
I can't hold onto him.

12:05.555 --> 12:06.834
Ah!

12:06.835 --> 12:08.514
- Shit! -Fuck! -Sorry.
- Oh, shit.

12:08.515 --> 12:11.754
Oh, God. Thank you.

12:11.755 --> 12:12.874
- Stay away.
- You okay?

12:12.875 --> 12:15.354
- Stay away. Yeah, yeah.
- Jesus.

12:15.355 --> 12:16.834
Careful.

12:16.835 --> 12:19.114
I don't know how fucking far it goes.

12:19.115 --> 12:20.874
- You all right?
- Yeah.

12:23.475 --> 12:24.877
It's fucking funny?

12:24.878 --> 12:28.634
- Yeah, kind of.
- Don't get too close.

12:28.635 --> 12:29.714
Fuck.

12:29.715 --> 12:31.035
Guys.

12:33.355 --> 12:34.554
What the fuck?

12:34.555 --> 12:36.194
Oh, shit.

12:36.195 --> 12:39.274
So we're hiking up this mountain

12:39.275 --> 12:43.114
to deliver a
monogrammed fucking windbreaker?

12:43.115 --> 12:46.617
"JM." Jesus Miller?

12:46.618 --> 12:48.154
Is this a fucking joke?

12:48.155 --> 12:50.795
I think it's an invitation.

13:06.755 --> 13:07.994
Good afternoon, everyone.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.794
This is a product that is intended

13:09.795 --> 13:12.434
to change and improve both your health

13:12.435 --> 13:13.714
and your looks, too.

13:13.715 --> 13:15.554
It's called the Blender Source.

13:15.555 --> 13:19.514
15 miles in under 30 minutes.

13:19.515 --> 13:23.275
Heart rate never got
above... go ahead and guess.

13:24.475 --> 13:25.864
110 BPMs.

13:26.995 --> 13:28.915
- Sample?
- Thank you, sir.

13:30.555 --> 13:32.149
That's Kale...

13:33.875 --> 13:35.194
and tomato.

13:35.195 --> 13:36.195
You should have some of this.

13:36.196 --> 13:37.735
Tremendous confection for the prostate.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.475
- Worry about your own prostate.
- No, my prostate's golden.

13:41.475 --> 13:43.434
Your bosses won't be pleased when they hear

13:43.435 --> 13:45.314
that I've been treated disrespectfully.

13:45.315 --> 13:46.994
I came up with many of them.

13:46.995 --> 13:50.554
I'm even responsible for
some of them being where they are.

13:50.555 --> 13:51.994
Where they are?

13:51.995 --> 13:53.835
What do you mean, like retirement homes?

13:58.454 --> 14:01.395
Mm-hmm. What is that?

14:01.395 --> 14:02.834
It's, like, dragon fruit and something.

14:02.835 --> 14:04.194
This is a small country.

14:04.195 --> 14:05.594
You wouldn't want us not to be friends.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.217
Duly noted.

14:06.218 --> 14:08.714
Are you gonna buy a
blender or are we done here?

14:08.715 --> 14:10.714
Instead of being the all-day smart-ass,
why don't you listen

14:10.715 --> 14:12.594
to someone who actually
knows what he's talking about?

14:12.595 --> 14:15.874
'Cause you can have all the
Internet skills and diplomas

14:15.875 --> 14:18.594
and triathlon fucking medals you want,

14:18.595 --> 14:19.754
but at the end of the day,

14:19.755 --> 14:21.314
the only thing that actually matters

14:21.315 --> 14:23.127
in this business is contacts.

14:23.715 --> 14:26.154
That means talking to
people, getting to know them,

14:26.155 --> 14:27.564
gaining their trust.

14:28.395 --> 14:29.834
It's pomegranate.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.794
Dragon fruit and
pomegranate. I should've...

14:31.795 --> 14:34.265
- I should've nailed that one.
- I'm a who's who of Belize.

14:34.835 --> 14:37.234
I'm a human fucking phone book.

14:37.235 --> 14:38.965
Now, see, that is exactly my point.

14:39.915 --> 14:41.918
Nobody uses the phone book anymore.

14:43.551 --> 14:46.449
I've been here for 20
years, you fucking prick.

14:47.515 --> 14:49.794
And nobody has a clue who I am.

14:49.795 --> 14:52.514
You're already known
locally as the wanker on the bike

14:52.515 --> 14:53.794
who smells of fish.

14:53.795 --> 14:55.594
Hardly fucking covert.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.074
How about you just... just
worry about yourself?

14:58.075 --> 15:00.994
I am, because you're drawing
attention to me.

15:00.995 --> 15:03.643
You listen to me, you ancient fuck!

15:04.598 --> 15:06.918
Nobody is paying attention to you.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.130
You're out.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.394
They all come with the same size in a cup.

15:17.395 --> 15:19.994
You drink it and you are ready to go.

15:34.482 --> 15:35.520
Finally.

16:03.653 --> 16:04.661
Excuse me.

16:05.015 --> 16:06.247
Can...

16:30.271 --> 16:31.550
Hello, excuse me?

16:31.575 --> 16:34.031
Hello. Hi. Do either of
you know of a man named...

16:44.634 --> 16:46.154
Over here. Come on.

16:48.751 --> 16:50.870
Ma'am, excuse me.

16:50.871 --> 16:52.110
Uh, habla Ingles?

16:52.111 --> 16:53.630
No, no.

16:53.631 --> 16:55.710
Sorry, we need... we need to find someone.

16:55.711 --> 16:59.031
Do you know, uh, who Jesus is?

17:01.591 --> 17:03.862
Can... can you show us where he lives?

17:07.644 --> 17:10.723
?La casa de Jesus, Si?

17:10.723 --> 17:12.803
- Think we should...
- Did she understand what you said?

17:12.804 --> 17:15.364
I don't know. I think we should follow her.

17:54.204 --> 17:57.004
Wait down there till they come for you.

18:50.884 --> 18:53.363
What do we do now?

18:53.364 --> 18:56.604
Now, I guess we
just... I guess we just wait.

18:58.124 --> 19:01.923
Guys. We should gift
wrap this thing, right?

19:01.924 --> 19:03.683
What?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.924
Can't just take it like this.

19:16.644 --> 19:18.324
Got it?

19:20.364 --> 19:22.043
Come on, here, fold over.

19:22.044 --> 19:23.164
You got to crease the edges.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.004
You have a number?

19:43.062 --> 19:45.164
- What?
- You have a number?

19:45.872 --> 19:47.208
Three.

19:48.192 --> 19:49.442
Seven?

19:50.524 --> 19:51.716
Okay, three.

19:52.764 --> 19:54.089
That smells good.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.761
You from U.S.?

19:58.003 --> 20:01.084
Yeah, Illinois, which is, yeah, U.S.

20:03.164 --> 20:04.551
What the fuck?

20:09.444 --> 20:11.563
Jesus Christ, lady.

20:11.564 --> 20:13.043
You go to school?

20:13.044 --> 20:15.083
Yes, in the bus.

20:15.084 --> 20:18.083
Yeah, we all got to take the school bus.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.784
No. My school is in the bus.

20:22.964 --> 20:26.083
Hey, um, on my way up
here, I saw a woman walking

20:26.084 --> 20:29.804
through the jungle with a
long white dress, long hair.

20:32.102 --> 20:33.484
You saw Xtabai.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.683
- See what?
- Xtabai.

20:35.684 --> 20:40.244
Sometimes you can find shrines
to her in the woods.

20:41.059 --> 20:43.449
She like a spirit. Men look for her.

20:43.474 --> 20:44.474
They do?

20:44.536 --> 20:46.321
Sure. She can be dangerous.

20:46.564 --> 20:51.603
She beautiful, but, uh, if you
can't please her, you die.

20:51.604 --> 20:54.564
What do you mean? Like, sex?

20:56.844 --> 20:58.091
Why do you die?

20:58.479 --> 20:59.999
Because she's Xtabai.

21:13.724 --> 21:14.724
Hey.

21:28.396 --> 21:29.396
Gus.

21:54.524 --> 21:56.444
Excuse me. Who are you?

21:56.826 --> 21:58.724
- Um...
- Excuse me, sir.

21:58.763 --> 22:00.804
Do you have a security pass to be in here?

22:01.208 --> 22:02.564
Um...

22:05.764 --> 22:06.989
Oh.

22:08.124 --> 22:09.923
I am trying to find your friend.

22:09.924 --> 22:11.364
Rochelle?

22:12.033 --> 22:14.048
She's really more of
colleague than a friend.

22:14.244 --> 22:15.681
Well, that's helpful.

22:15.814 --> 22:19.324
I've already been to every
hospital, morgue, hostel,

22:19.325 --> 22:21.364
hotel within a ten-mile radius.

22:21.768 --> 22:23.484
You didn't find her?

22:26.378 --> 22:28.243
I want you to make a
list of the same places

22:28.244 --> 22:30.702
within a 20-mile radius
and keep making that list

22:30.780 --> 22:33.083
until you reach the border.

22:33.084 --> 22:35.363
Can you do that for me, sweetie?

22:35.364 --> 22:38.203
Sweetie? It's 2016.

22:38.204 --> 22:39.204
I know.

23:01.783 --> 23:03.244
Buenas noches. Bienvenidos.

23:03.245 --> 23:04.244
Hey.

23:04.245 --> 23:05.643
How you doing, guys?

23:05.644 --> 23:07.643
- Good.
- Good, thank you.

23:07.644 --> 23:09.165
Welcome to town.

23:09.909 --> 23:13.003
I have a present, a
welcome present for you.

23:13.004 --> 23:14.004
Okay?

23:17.742 --> 23:18.914
Let's drink.

23:20.324 --> 23:22.406
I will buy you a drink. My treat.

23:24.218 --> 23:26.163
Thank you, but no thanks.

23:26.164 --> 23:30.003
- We're waiting for someone.
- No. We have to drink.

23:30.004 --> 23:33.723
We all have to drink, you
know, a welcome to the town.

23:33.724 --> 23:36.323
Uh, you will like. It's very good stuff.

23:36.324 --> 23:37.923
All right. Cheers.

23:37.924 --> 23:39.204
Yeah.

23:43.444 --> 23:44.883
- Strong.
- Very strong.

23:44.884 --> 23:47.763
Good. It's good, good.

23:47.764 --> 23:48.724
No, no, everybody drinks.

23:48.725 --> 23:49.803
Everybody.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.763
It's on me. It's my treat.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.764
Good.

23:56.244 --> 23:57.563
Good.

23:57.564 --> 23:59.483
- Strong.
- Yeah.

23:59.484 --> 24:01.644
It's good. It's good.

24:08.324 --> 24:10.043
Cry.

24:10.044 --> 24:11.564
No, no, him, please.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.844
- No, thank you.
- Oh, no, he's not gonna have a drink.

24:13.845 --> 24:15.129
It's not good for him, so...

24:15.575 --> 24:18.084
Oh, it's not good for me; I still drink.

24:22.124 --> 24:24.403
- He's all right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

24:24.404 --> 24:27.603
This is a nice town with nice people.

24:27.604 --> 24:28.957
It's okay to drink with nice people, right?

24:28.958 --> 24:31.243
Lovely people and no offense.

24:31.244 --> 24:32.372
I just... I never drink alcohol.

24:32.397 --> 24:34.583
You know, look, I'm
gonna have his drink for him.

24:34.608 --> 24:36.323
No, you already have your drink.

24:36.324 --> 24:38.043
Now it's time to take his drink.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.323
- He doesn't need a drink.
- No, it's not okay.

24:39.324 --> 24:40.324
You got this guy.

24:40.325 --> 24:41.683
You have to take a fucking drink, man!

24:41.684 --> 24:43.203
Take a fucking drink!

24:43.204 --> 24:45.283
Take a fucking drink, man! I
said to take a fucking drink!

24:45.284 --> 24:46.883
- Take a fucking drink!
- Okay!

24:46.884 --> 24:49.003
Okay, okay. You
know... you know, it's fine.

24:49.004 --> 24:50.742
I'll have a sip and we'll be done with it.

24:50.743 --> 24:51.852
- He has to take a drink.
- Salud.

24:51.853 --> 24:54.324
- Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- Salud, Salud.

24:56.124 --> 24:57.563
Wow.

24:57.564 --> 25:01.203
That's very pussy. You
take a... this is how.

25:01.204 --> 25:02.204
Whoa.

25:02.205 --> 25:03.251
So now take the fucking drink now.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.883
Drink like a man! Drink
like a fucking man now!

25:05.884 --> 25:07.643
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Lex, you don't have to, right?

25:07.644 --> 25:09.843
- Salud.
- No, don't... You took the...

25:09.844 --> 25:11.362
I'll do it... I'll take a gulp for the guy.

25:11.363 --> 25:13.964
- Big deal, all right? What?
- No, I... Oh!

25:15.804 --> 25:17.683
- I'm really sorry.
- Sorry about that.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.803
That was just a total accident.

25:19.804 --> 25:21.083
What is this?

25:21.084 --> 25:23.404
That belongs to Jesus.

25:36.764 --> 25:38.723
Whoa!

25:38.724 --> 25:40.483
Jesus Christ. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

25:40.484 --> 25:41.963
Where we gonna go?

25:41.964 --> 25:44.164
Back where the fuck we... we came from!

25:46.524 --> 25:49.323
What the fuck?

26:21.117 --> 26:22.797
Round complete.

26:30.884 --> 26:33.243
Round three, safety off.

26:33.244 --> 26:35.763
Hunt all animals.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.199
Hmm.

27:05.177 --> 27:06.376
What is this?

27:06.377 --> 27:09.017
That's a gift for Jesus.

27:10.977 --> 27:12.075
Jesus.

27:16.817 --> 27:17.974
Open it.

27:19.298 --> 27:21.717
It's... it's not ours to open.

27:23.103 --> 27:24.663
Is... is he here?

27:24.897 --> 27:27.416
It's really meant for him.

27:27.417 --> 27:30.256
Yeah, we-we were told to
give it directly to Jesus.

27:30.257 --> 27:33.936
Right, we-we delivered the
package and-and the money,

27:33.937 --> 27:35.816
so I think we should probably go.

27:35.817 --> 27:38.497
- Right?
- Yeah.

27:41.417 --> 27:42.537
Open it.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.377
Pablo.

27:52.697 --> 27:55.777
Fuck me! Who wrapped this?

27:59.737 --> 28:01.816
There's a lot of money in the bag.

28:01.817 --> 28:05.176
Yeah, w-we came to return
it, along with that.

28:05.177 --> 28:07.051
How they get you to come here?

28:09.777 --> 28:10.934
They take your wives?

28:12.660 --> 28:13.660
Your kids?

28:14.097 --> 28:15.264
Aaron.

28:16.381 --> 28:17.497
Aaron sent us.

28:20.857 --> 28:23.736
Big conehead motherfucker with
the fucking biker tights.

28:27.017 --> 28:28.978
I know Aaron.

28:30.502 --> 28:33.936
You know that fucker took
a boat, Jesus's boat,

28:33.937 --> 28:35.736
in the middle of a fucking drop, man,

28:35.737 --> 28:37.535
in the middle of the day.

28:38.730 --> 28:40.657
That took some serious balls, man.

28:40.658 --> 28:42.535
That's a giant motherfucking move!

28:44.337 --> 28:46.257
Except it wasn't,

28:47.140 --> 28:49.085
'cause you bozos stole the damn boat.

28:53.697 --> 28:56.976
Yeah, but we did
return the package and-and...

28:56.977 --> 28:58.576
- and the money, right?
- Yeah.

28:58.577 --> 29:00.576
If-if this is about the
boat, we can show you where it is.

29:00.577 --> 29:03.736
And-and... it's not damaged or anything.

29:03.737 --> 29:05.656
It's just... just muddy.

29:05.657 --> 29:08.275
Jesus will probably want to kill you.

29:09.369 --> 29:11.697
All I can say is that we are...

29:13.497 --> 29:16.257
very, very sorry.

29:24.577 --> 29:26.034
You're Catholic.

29:27.177 --> 29:29.856
Are you Catholic? Católico.

29:29.857 --> 29:31.178
I... I was raised Catholic, yeah.

29:31.949 --> 29:33.316
So what are you now?

29:35.089 --> 29:36.256
I don't know.

29:36.257 --> 29:37.894
Were you confirmed?

29:39.080 --> 29:41.566
- Yes.
- Then you're Catholic!

29:42.177 --> 29:43.697
What name did you take?

29:45.857 --> 29:47.597
Your confirmation name.

29:48.380 --> 29:49.425
Luke.

29:50.897 --> 29:52.668
Because of Luke the Skywalker?

29:54.257 --> 29:55.456
Yes.

30:05.559 --> 30:08.376
I took Jasmine.

30:08.377 --> 30:10.176
You're supposed to pick a Saint,

30:10.177 --> 30:11.577
but I like my name.

30:12.617 --> 30:15.897
So, who did it?

30:19.722 --> 30:21.257
Who killed the cop?

30:25.217 --> 30:26.822
Who killed the cop?!

30:38.697 --> 30:40.417
Vamos.

31:07.664 --> 31:08.664
What?

31:32.417 --> 31:34.257
Where do you think you are?

31:36.500 --> 31:40.866
Guess... where you are.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.006
I-I'm sorry. I don't know.

31:43.937 --> 31:45.297
Guess.

31:48.377 --> 31:52.331
Uh, I guess maybe some... there.

31:52.332 --> 31:56.057
Touch. Touch where.

31:59.137 --> 32:00.856
Ah.

32:03.937 --> 32:07.176
We are where Mexico,
Guatemala and Belize intersect.

32:07.177 --> 32:08.637
We are nowhere.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.416
There's a saying up here.

32:15.417 --> 32:17.256
Keep your mother in Guatemala,

32:17.257 --> 32:20.486
your wife in Belize and
your girlfriend in Mexico.

32:21.353 --> 32:23.768
- Isn't that right, Pablo?
- ?Que?

32:24.297 --> 32:25.297
?Que?

32:25.722 --> 32:28.235
They both know about the
Mexican girl, Pablo.

32:36.157 --> 32:38.448
Guatemalans will fuck anything.

32:39.697 --> 32:43.417
You know who else will fuck anything? Bam!

32:49.377 --> 32:51.212
We shouldn't have come.

32:52.457 --> 32:54.391
Shit, shit.

32:55.553 --> 32:57.273
Shit.

33:00.966 --> 33:02.587
They're gonna kill Joel.

33:04.177 --> 33:05.736
They're gonna kill us.

33:05.737 --> 33:07.344
- No.
- Yeah.

33:07.345 --> 33:08.936
Look, we-we brought back the money.

33:08.937 --> 33:10.056
That was the deal.

33:10.057 --> 33:10.826
We brought back the fucking money.

33:10.827 --> 33:13.029
The money, it's short.

33:15.983 --> 33:17.506
We're 40 grand short.

33:18.023 --> 33:19.702
I fucked up in Guatemala.

33:19.703 --> 33:20.938
You didn't tell us.

33:21.623 --> 33:22.922
I told Joel.

33:23.663 --> 33:25.382
I told him. He knows.

33:25.383 --> 33:26.942
I said we shouldn't come here,

33:26.943 --> 33:28.383
and he said we don't have a choice.

33:31.703 --> 33:34.147
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:35.303 --> 33:36.920
I'm sorry.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.487
I never liked Captain Moreno.

33:43.663 --> 33:45.112
Jesus adored her.

33:46.143 --> 33:47.463
I don't know why.

33:50.623 --> 33:51.828
Sit.

34:01.183 --> 34:02.719
You have a nice smile.

34:04.063 --> 34:05.943
Do people tell you that?

34:07.916 --> 34:09.702
Uh, no, no.

34:10.993 --> 34:12.710
Women think it, though.

34:14.143 --> 34:17.303
And you know they do,
so you use it on them.

34:19.422 --> 34:23.223
I can tell because you
give it a little extra.

34:26.036 --> 34:27.636
Hi.

34:29.382 --> 34:30.757
You're aware of it.

34:32.223 --> 34:33.661
If a person were perceptive,

34:33.663 --> 34:35.447
they'd be aware that you are aware of it.

34:37.072 --> 34:38.463
Maybe that's all part of it.

34:39.393 --> 34:43.463
A whole other
conversation happening with your smile.

34:43.463 --> 34:45.703
Do you want to fuck?

34:48.822 --> 34:50.811
I used to not say what I think.

34:52.822 --> 34:53.849
Now I do.

34:55.743 --> 34:56.998
Try it.

34:57.698 --> 34:58.857
Say what you think.

35:09.818 --> 35:11.451
I'm getting bored, Joel.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.138
Say what you think.

35:13.553 --> 35:16.583
Say. Say.

35:19.178 --> 35:22.411
I think the "J" on the
jacket isn't for Jesus.

35:23.863 --> 35:26.023
I think it's for Jazmin.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.583
I think you're Jesus.

35:31.063 --> 35:32.302
Ooh.

35:34.903 --> 35:37.823
Jesus is my father.

35:40.023 --> 35:41.823
He's on vacation.

35:43.583 --> 35:44.678
What?

35:45.743 --> 35:46.743
Say.

35:47.941 --> 35:49.006
I think...

35:49.978 --> 35:52.338
I think he's probably not on vacation.

35:54.423 --> 35:55.423
I think maybe he's...

35:55.943 --> 35:57.500
maybe something happened to him.

35:58.063 --> 35:59.063
Correct.

36:01.183 --> 36:03.489
He was strangled with a barbed wire.

36:11.023 --> 36:12.553
Say what you think.

36:13.874 --> 36:17.274
Now I think maybe

36:17.423 --> 36:20.743
you strangled your father with barbed wire.

36:24.663 --> 36:26.533
My muscles make you not want to fuck?

36:28.306 --> 36:30.583
For some, they are kind of horny.

36:30.583 --> 36:32.303
There's something you should know.

36:33.724 --> 36:34.804
Want a bump?

36:35.023 --> 36:36.042
Not right now.

36:37.103 --> 36:38.103
Me neither.

36:40.377 --> 36:42.350
Ah, I just do a little.

36:45.008 --> 36:46.131
The money's short.

36:51.103 --> 36:54.703
It's 40,000 or so short.

37:19.123 --> 37:20.443
- Fuck.
- Huh?

37:20.623 --> 37:22.251
The welcoming committee's back.

37:22.276 --> 37:23.845
What? Oh.

37:28.263 --> 37:30.345
- Hey, Buenas noches.
- Hey.

37:41.183 --> 37:42.582
We don't want any trouble.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.222
We don't want no trouble.

37:44.223 --> 37:46.302
Relax, all right? So...

37:46.303 --> 37:48.222
I'm so happy to see you 'cause I want

37:48.223 --> 37:49.742
to really apologize with you.

37:49.743 --> 37:52.622
- I was not good. I was very drunk before.
- That's okay.

37:52.623 --> 37:53.483
Now everything's cool.

37:53.484 --> 37:55.608
Now I'm good. Okay, we're cool?

37:55.633 --> 37:57.223
- Yeah. We're good.
- We're cool.

37:57.223 --> 37:58.902
- Sorry. Okay.
- Yeah.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.383
- Give me a hug.
- All right.

38:07.749 --> 38:08.993
Where's my money?

38:09.411 --> 38:11.501
- I took it.
- Hmm.

38:12.303 --> 38:15.959
I went off alone and I took... I took it.

38:16.904 --> 38:18.423
Hmm. And your friends don't know?

38:18.423 --> 38:20.463
Do you think they'd have walked
up here if they did?

38:23.983 --> 38:25.582
- All right, all right.
- No, we're cool.

38:25.583 --> 38:27.102
- We're friends. All right. Just playing.
- We're cool.

38:27.103 --> 38:28.582
- All right, man. Yeah.
- Just playing, okay?

38:28.583 --> 38:29.702
- Okay?
- All right.

38:29.703 --> 38:32.468
I... killed Sophia.

38:33.423 --> 38:34.762
I did. It was me.

38:34.787 --> 38:36.043
I killed the cop.

38:37.423 --> 38:38.785
And I spent your money.

38:40.309 --> 38:41.465
Just me.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.316
You got kids?

38:47.423 --> 38:50.383
I got... I-I have two, a girl and a boy.

38:51.943 --> 38:54.817
It's gonna fuck them up to
find out their dad died,

38:55.303 --> 38:56.966
especially your daughter.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.463
Some girls, they... they can handle it.

39:02.786 --> 39:04.068
Look at me.

39:05.450 --> 39:06.765
I turned out okay.

39:08.622 --> 39:11.142
So where is Mr. Big Bro, Big Guy?

39:11.463 --> 39:13.422
- He's inside.
- With Jesus.

39:13.423 --> 39:14.595
Oh, that's too bad.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.148
But, listen, I want to apologize

39:16.173 --> 39:18.430
for spilling the
drink; That was an accident.

39:18.455 --> 39:21.175
- No hard feelings, okay?
- No hard feelings. Don't worry.

39:24.853 --> 39:26.384
What... what if...

39:27.615 --> 39:29.654
what if I can help you?

39:29.655 --> 39:32.759
Maybe, say, do things for you?

39:32.759 --> 39:34.688
I'm a fucking drug dealer, man.

39:34.689 --> 39:35.915
What if I could?

39:39.895 --> 39:42.534
Give Big Bro this from me, okay?

39:42.535 --> 39:43.694
Yeah.

39:43.695 --> 39:45.174
- Okay? No hard feelings.
- Cool, man.

39:45.175 --> 39:47.094
No hard feelings, all right?

39:47.095 --> 39:49.134
- Ow.
- Sorry.

39:49.135 --> 39:51.014
- Okay.
- Bye, guys.

39:51.015 --> 39:52.454
- All right, see you.
- Oh, fuck.

39:52.455 --> 39:53.534
What's wrong?

39:53.535 --> 39:55.454
- Shit! Ow!
- What's wrong?

39:55.455 --> 39:57.174
Oh, fuck.

39:57.175 --> 39:58.175
- No. No.
- Shit!

39:58.176 --> 40:00.095
No, no, sit him down. Sit him down.

40:05.175 --> 40:07.734
You ever do blood
brothers when you were a kid?

40:07.735 --> 40:09.494
Yes.

40:09.495 --> 40:11.135
Lick it.

40:16.855 --> 40:18.454
They stabbed him!

40:30.969 --> 40:32.535
- Put pressure on it, man.
- Okay.

40:32.536 --> 40:34.654
- Come on, help!
- What? I got it.

40:34.655 --> 40:37.054
- Do something. Do something!
- They stabbed him!

40:37.055 --> 40:38.134
- I got it.
- He's been stabbed.

40:38.135 --> 40:39.414
- He stabbed him.
- Who, who?

40:39.415 --> 40:40.894
- The guy, the guy...
- The fucking guy.

40:40.895 --> 40:42.134
- The guy with the...
- Help!

40:42.135 --> 40:44.094
Help, help! Please, please!

40:44.095 --> 40:46.735
Pablo, put them on the bus.

40:52.015 --> 40:54.334
Lex, we are here for you. You hear me?

40:54.335 --> 40:55.934
Lex!

40:55.935 --> 40:58.614
Lex. Lex?

40:58.615 --> 41:01.694
- We are here for you, man. You hear me?
- Mm-hmm.

41:03.335 --> 41:05.574
Hey, can you go faster, please?

41:05.575 --> 41:06.854
Listen, Gus.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.454
Yeah?

41:09.895 --> 41:11.345
Promise me...

41:11.935 --> 41:13.845
Promise you... y-you'll...

41:14.375 --> 41:15.974
look after my dad, okay?

41:15.975 --> 41:18.201
You promise me you're gonna stay awake.

41:24.375 --> 41:25.655
Lex!

41:26.195 --> 41:27.195
Lex?

41:33.241 --> 41:34.717
Lex, I tell you I...

41:36.441 --> 41:38.521
I located my dad.

41:41.241 --> 41:42.560
How?

41:42.561 --> 41:44.600
I got sentimental and found him online.

41:44.601 --> 41:46.360
Linkedin.

41:46.361 --> 41:49.560
He's been stocking
groceries for the last ten years

41:49.561 --> 41:50.880
in the same place.

41:50.881 --> 41:52.800
Why does he need a Linkedin account?

41:52.801 --> 41:54.288
I don't know.

41:55.201 --> 41:58.640
Why would anybody need a Linkedin account?

41:58.641 --> 41:59.720
That's funny.

41:59.721 --> 42:01.720
You keep cracking jokes, Lex.

42:01.721 --> 42:02.855
Mm.

42:07.281 --> 42:09.160
Excuse me! We need help.

42:09.161 --> 42:11.160
Our friend... our friend was stabbed.

42:11.161 --> 42:12.400
- Calm down, calm down.
- Okay.

42:12.401 --> 42:13.880
How long ago did this happen?

42:13.881 --> 42:15.240
Um, I don't know, like, an hour.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.640
Here, turn him around. Here, hey.

42:17.641 --> 42:18.880
Don't rush him, don't rush him!

42:18.881 --> 42:20.920
- All right. Got him?
- Yeah.

42:20.921 --> 42:22.280
- Easy, easy.
- Okay.

42:22.281 --> 42:24.320
- Here, come on, let's go.
- E.R. Hurry.

42:24.321 --> 42:25.560
Pressure on it.

42:25.561 --> 42:27.400
No, you guys, wait here, wait here.

42:27.401 --> 42:29.441
- We'll take care of your friend.
- Okay.

42:44.717 --> 42:46.031
Jesus...

42:47.801 --> 42:49.070
you get to meet him?

42:51.315 --> 42:52.315
Yeah.

42:56.481 --> 42:58.880
Well, what'd he say?

42:58.881 --> 43:00.080
They know we were short?

43:00.081 --> 43:01.440
Yeah, of course.

43:01.441 --> 43:05.001
Wait. Why... why did he
let us just walk away?

43:05.787 --> 43:06.834
I don't know.

43:07.521 --> 43:09.350
Maybe Jesus forgave us.

43:11.961 --> 43:13.713
- Where are you going?
- Call Aaron.

43:16.361 --> 43:17.667
Passports.

44:09.041 --> 44:10.600
Ah, what's going on here?

44:10.601 --> 44:12.000
Come on.

44:51.692 --> 44:52.716
Fuck.

44:59.001 --> 45:00.334
I'm gonna go clean up.

45:01.109 --> 45:04.680
Hey, if you see a soda
machine, let me know.

45:19.927 --> 45:22.967
Oh, shit.

45:23.053 --> 45:25.726
Oh, that...

45:25.882 --> 45:27.656
That's something I don't need to see.

45:36.481 --> 45:39.200
Um, she's not here.

45:39.201 --> 45:40.960
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

45:59.641 --> 46:01.522
Excuse me. You speak English?

46:04.321 --> 46:05.321
Yeah.

46:05.638 --> 46:06.835
You an American?

46:08.401 --> 46:10.120
Oh, thank God.

46:10.121 --> 46:11.680
Look, I, um...

46:11.681 --> 46:13.280
I get completely turned around down here.

46:13.281 --> 46:14.720
I don't know where the hell I am.

46:14.721 --> 46:16.882
Could you tell me where the
nurse's station is, please?

46:18.983 --> 46:20.343
Right down the hall to your right.

46:20.532 --> 46:21.532
Thank you.

46:22.021 --> 46:23.514
Hey, I'm Conrad.

46:24.721 --> 46:25.764
Gus.

46:26.668 --> 46:27.943
You're Gus Givens.

46:30.478 --> 46:31.751
I'm Conrad Tull.

46:32.634 --> 46:34.358
Legal attaché, FBI, Panama.

46:34.359 --> 46:38.238
Do you know anything about a
missing embassy woman, Gus?

46:41.413 --> 46:44.171
What do you say you and I
take a little walk, have a talk?
