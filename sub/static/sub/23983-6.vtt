WEBVTT

00:03.627 --> 00:05.495
Hey, look who's home.

00:05.497 --> 00:06.696
Hey, how was school?

00:06.698 --> 00:08.029
How dare you!

00:08.032 --> 00:09.165
What is it now? My shirt?

00:09.167 --> 00:10.680
My tighty whities? The fact that

00:10.690 --> 00:11.966
I still get DVDs from Netflix?

00:11.976 --> 00:13.701
Uh, all of the above and you've never

00:13.711 --> 00:15.436
introduced me to my grandparents.

00:15.446 --> 00:16.904
Well, you barely like me,

00:16.914 --> 00:19.075
so why would you wanna meet
the people that made me?

00:19.086 --> 00:21.294
Because I have to do a
monologue on a grandparent

00:21.305 --> 00:23.310
for history class,
and Mr. Jones is going

00:23.320 --> 00:25.379
on paternity leave for eight months.

00:25.389 --> 00:27.181
So it's 100% of our grade.

00:27.191 --> 00:30.050
Oh, just do it on your mom's
parents, Sandeep and Aruna.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.585
They were a Neilson family one year.

00:31.595 --> 00:33.320
And they got "Smash" canceled.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.022
We're not currently on speaking terms.

00:35.032 --> 00:37.791
Well, you are in luck. Our father...

00:37.801 --> 00:39.560
Jimmy Cook... was fascinating.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.929
He was the first guy in our
neighborhood to eat a taco.

00:41.939 --> 00:44.064
Yeah, it wasn't for him,
but he tried it.

00:44.074 --> 00:46.400
A taco? Parvati's grandmother

00:46.410 --> 00:48.769
was the first Indian woman
to climb Mount Everest.

00:48.779 --> 00:52.039
They're making a movie
about her starring Emma Stone.

00:52.049 --> 00:54.375
What about your mom, Gayle?

00:54.385 --> 00:57.678
Uhh, I will introduce you
to anyone else in our family.

00:57.688 --> 01:00.514
Our cousin Abby-she's a millionaire
from a Bill O'Reilly settlement.

01:00.524 --> 01:03.617
Look, I just don't think it's a
good idea for you to meet Gayle.

01:03.627 --> 01:05.436
Yeah, you're right. It
is a wonderful idea.

01:05.447 --> 01:08.014
Back when mom was 17, she was crowned.

01:08.025 --> 01:09.250
Miss Black Irish Brooklyn.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.086
Her talent was bikini trampoline.

01:12.096 --> 01:14.088
Oh, she looks amazing.

01:14.098 --> 01:15.623
But will she still like me?

01:15.633 --> 01:17.124
She missed me at my cutest.

01:17.134 --> 01:18.492
Now I'm just hunky.

01:18.502 --> 01:21.028
Okay, I'm sorry,
but Gayle and I don't speak.

01:21.038 --> 01:22.897
- She's toxic.
- Don't speak?

01:22.907 --> 01:26.133
Toxic? So far, you're just
listing amazing female anthems.

01:26.143 --> 01:28.269
- Now I have to meet her.
- No!

01:28.279 --> 01:32.707
Okay, your grandmother
is a dangerous woman.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.341
Oops, I did it again.

01:35.398 --> 01:38.979
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:38.989 --> 01:42.029
- Well, I'm off.
- Guess I have no choice

01:42.040 --> 01:44.999
but to write my monologue
on Jimmy Cook's

01:45.009 --> 01:47.835
- battle with rosacea.
- Heroic battle.

01:47.845 --> 01:50.471
It was everywhere.
He looked like a Craisin.

01:50.481 --> 01:52.206
I know Mom wasn't perfect.

01:52.216 --> 01:53.775
Wasn't perfect?

01:53.785 --> 01:55.710
We got chicken pox 11 times in one year.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.279
Yeah, and Don Mattingly
visited us in the hospital.

01:58.289 --> 01:59.781
In his next game, he drew a walk,

01:59.791 --> 02:02.216
- just like I asked him to.
- Look, Mom's been

02:02.226 --> 02:04.419
disappointing me my entire life.

02:04.429 --> 02:06.363
I don't want her doing
the same thing to Michael.

02:06.374 --> 02:08.990
Also, there's a slight
possibility that she doesn't

02:09.000 --> 02:11.192
- know about him yet.
- About him living here.

02:11.202 --> 02:13.394
About him living... period.

02:13.404 --> 02:16.364
What? You can't keep
keeping Michael a secret.

02:16.374 --> 02:18.199
Look, I'm going to tell her eventually.

02:18.209 --> 02:20.403
But Gayle never liked admitting
she was a mom.

02:20.414 --> 02:22.269
How do you think she's gonna
like being a grandmother?

02:22.280 --> 02:24.160
Okay, but you don't talk
to her as much as I do.

02:24.171 --> 02:25.910
Marrying Gene has really
mellowed her out.

02:25.921 --> 02:27.478
Poor Gene.

02:27.488 --> 02:29.446
As if escaping Tiananmen Square
and running

02:29.456 --> 02:31.682
five DSW shoe stores
wasn't stressful enough.

02:31.692 --> 02:33.525
Now he's gotta clean up
after Hurricane Gayle.

02:33.536 --> 02:36.295
He's got her down
to a tropical storm at most.

02:36.305 --> 02:37.824
Look, Mom always took it easy on you.

02:37.835 --> 02:39.532
And I'm not ready
to introduce her to Michael.

02:39.542 --> 02:42.067
All right, I promise she's changed.
At least shoot her an email.

02:42.077 --> 02:46.105
It's MarriedNotBuried45@aol.com.

02:46.115 --> 02:48.240
Well, it doesn't sound great
when I say it out loud.

02:50.186 --> 02:53.412
Hey, boss. We need to redo
the Champions website.

02:53.422 --> 02:55.381
- We have a website?
- Yes.

02:55.391 --> 02:57.149
Uncle Bud designed it 20 years ago

02:57.159 --> 02:59.118
to earn back the money
he lost on Beanie Babies.

02:59.128 --> 03:00.953
Okay, look, anyone
can point out problems.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.988
Bees are dying.
What I need are solutions.

03:02.998 --> 03:05.057
- Doctors for bugs.
- I'll build the site.

03:05.067 --> 03:07.593
Maybe could post info
about my upcoming show.

03:07.603 --> 03:11.030
Improv for the Fellas.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.638
Or my boyfriend Asher could do it.

03:12.649 --> 03:13.968
He's really good with computers.

03:13.979 --> 03:15.404
He even designed ours to warn him

03:15.414 --> 03:17.306
- when I'm on my way home.
- Mm-hmm.

03:17.316 --> 03:19.541
- So that he can start dinner.
- Okay, guys,

03:19.551 --> 03:21.644
if this is as important
as you say it is,

03:21.654 --> 03:23.479
I need a digital native.

03:23.489 --> 03:26.081
Someone who's a genius at web design...

03:26.091 --> 03:27.316
who will also work for free.

03:28.994 --> 03:31.353
<i>Michael, I need you
to Zuckerberg our website.</i>

03:31.363 --> 03:33.489
And redesigning it
would look pretty good

03:33.499 --> 03:34.890
on a college application.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.592
Especially since the only science class

03:36.602 --> 03:38.630
offered at your
school is on-stage chemistry.

03:38.641 --> 03:40.296
I'm way too talented to go to college.

03:40.306 --> 03:41.430
But I'll do it.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.299
If you introduce me to Gayle.

03:43.309 --> 03:45.467
A little quid GoPro.

03:45.477 --> 03:48.037
- That's really what you want.
- Look, I made my decision.

03:48.047 --> 03:49.538
Deliver me Gayle and I'll deliver you

03:49.548 --> 03:52.107
the biggest Internet sensation
since Buzzfeed.

03:52.117 --> 03:54.109
13 GIFs That Show Michael's Reaction

03:54.119 --> 03:55.511
to Meeting His Grandmother.

03:59.301 --> 04:00.359
You're gonna do all 13.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.794
I mean, I have them.

04:01.804 --> 04:04.531
"Dear Mom, long time, no email.

04:04.541 --> 04:06.399
"Remember when you bailed
on my First Communion

04:06.409 --> 04:08.034
"because your nose job hadn't set yet?

04:08.044 --> 04:10.336
"I do!" Exclamation point.

04:10.346 --> 04:12.071
Look, this... this isn't working.

04:12.081 --> 04:14.274
Hey, what if I tell Michael
there was a sudden illness

04:14.284 --> 04:16.041
- and I bring him an urn.
- No.

04:16.052 --> 04:17.343
All right, you're doing great.

04:17.353 --> 04:18.878
You didn't even swear in this draft.

04:18.887 --> 04:20.279
But hey, if you're struggling.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.051
What if I just... I don't know,

04:22.062 --> 04:24.158
you know, like,
set up a lunch at 1:45 tomorrow

04:24.169 --> 04:25.681
where you can tell her
about him in person?

04:25.692 --> 04:29.222
- So you already set this lunch up.
- No. Absolutely not.

04:29.232 --> 04:32.564
Gene set up the lunch. I had suggested
dinner and a show and ice cream.

04:32.575 --> 04:34.750
Ugh! Okay, fine! Lunch.

04:34.761 --> 04:36.253
Yes! This is gonna be so great!

04:36.263 --> 04:38.722
But I am vetting her
before she meets Michael, okay?

04:38.732 --> 04:40.342
I don't need her dashing his hopes, too.

04:40.353 --> 04:43.010
He's still upset we're not going to
the Cannes Film Festival this year.

04:43.021 --> 04:46.162
Okay. When was the last
time you even saw Mom?

04:46.172 --> 04:48.898
Four years ago.

04:48.908 --> 04:50.199
On Tinder.

04:50.210 --> 04:52.335
I had to throw away my phone.

04:59.587 --> 05:02.546
All right, everybody,
we're all aware, ns I'm sure

05:02.557 --> 05:04.157
this gym's website is even more outdated

05:04.159 --> 05:07.330
- than Dana's butterfly sleeves.
- What do you mean?

05:07.341 --> 05:08.840
I think I look like Stevie Nicks.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.841
Hey, whoa, whoa. I made
that website, all right?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.633
You don't mess with a classic, huh?

05:12.644 --> 05:15.236
Like, why make another season
of "Big Little Lies"?

05:15.246 --> 05:17.639
The story's complete, Celeste got away.

05:17.649 --> 05:19.741
Maybe each week the new site can profile

05:19.751 --> 05:20.852
a different instructor.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.477
'Cause right now,
when you Google Shabaz Cole,

05:22.487 --> 05:23.678
the only result that comes up

05:23.688 --> 05:25.980
is "Actor Dragged Off Airplane"

05:25.990 --> 05:28.116
for Hijacking Seatbelt Demonstration".

05:28.126 --> 05:30.318
Guys, I promised Vince this website

05:30.328 --> 05:31.819
would break the Internet.

05:31.829 --> 05:33.855
Or at the very least, our Internet.

05:33.865 --> 05:36.291
So let's have some ideas, please.

05:36.301 --> 05:38.560
Oh! I have so got it.

05:38.570 --> 05:41.971
People love animals.

05:45.068 --> 05:47.744
That's your entire idea? Animals?

05:47.755 --> 05:49.370
And that's just off the top of my head.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.005
Okay, I know I didn't specify,

05:51.015 --> 05:54.067
but let's have some good ideas.

05:54.078 --> 05:55.957
It seems like there are only two things

05:55.968 --> 05:57.588
people wanna know about a gym.

05:57.599 --> 05:58.957
Are they gonna get ripped?

05:58.967 --> 06:00.959
And how sweet is the eye candy?

06:00.969 --> 06:04.663
Unfortunately, the answers
are "no" and "not very."

06:04.673 --> 06:06.598
That's not true.
I have a client, Denise,

06:06.608 --> 06:08.267
who's lost, like, 80 pounds.

06:08.277 --> 06:09.868
But to return to my animals idea...

06:09.878 --> 06:12.905
Oh! We can do before and after photos.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.607
Like that time I gained
100 pounds to play Garfield

06:15.617 --> 06:17.843
- at a birthday party.
- Yes!

06:17.853 --> 06:20.379
And we have Denise
do a testimonial video

06:20.389 --> 06:22.514
on how Champions saved her life.

06:22.524 --> 06:26.018
Now, Britney, take me to my star.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.756
There she is. But just so you know,

06:30.766 --> 06:32.646
her personality's bad.

06:32.657 --> 06:34.382
Please, I love difficult women.

06:34.392 --> 06:36.884
The theme for my 10th birthday
was Kim Cattrall.

06:36.901 --> 06:39.935
She tried to get it shut down.

06:41.165 --> 06:43.924
Excuse me, Denise.
My name is Michael Patel

06:43.934 --> 06:45.726
and it was brought
to my attention that you...

06:45.736 --> 06:47.695
Live in a PT Cruiser in the alley.

06:47.705 --> 06:49.397
- It's not mine.
- No, I was actually told

06:49.407 --> 06:51.232
that you lost a lot of weight
at our gym.

06:51.242 --> 06:54.002
Would you be willing to talk
about your transformation

06:54.013 --> 06:56.206
- for an Internet video?
- For serious?

06:56.217 --> 06:59.577
- And I could go by Denise?
- Is that not your name?

06:59.587 --> 07:03.047
Legally, I changed it to Pizza
Hut for a radio contest

07:03.057 --> 07:05.683
- that I almost won.
- Okay. Well, then,

07:05.693 --> 07:09.320
welcome aboard, Ms. Hut.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.607
See? Mom's car's still parked out front.

07:14.618 --> 07:16.543
She didn't bail
to do something more fun.

07:16.553 --> 07:18.579
- That's growth.
- Yeah, or she took

07:18.589 --> 07:20.981
a cab to the airport.
It's spring break somewhere.

07:20.991 --> 07:24.752
Look, just please,
be on my side in there.

07:24.762 --> 07:25.919
- Ohh.
- Oh, my God! Mom!

07:25.929 --> 07:28.355
- What happened?
- Oh, it's you.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.991
I thought it was that cop I rear-ended.

07:31.001 --> 07:33.294
Matthew, you look wonderful,

07:33.304 --> 07:34.762
my handsome little angel.

07:34.772 --> 07:37.898
- Ohh, if I weren't your mother.
- Mom! Stop.

07:37.908 --> 07:40.234
You're embarrassing me
in front of my friend.

07:40.244 --> 07:41.902
Yes, Vincent.

07:41.912 --> 07:45.005
- It's been too long.
- What's happening?

07:45.015 --> 07:47.270
You look fit. What's your secret?

07:47.281 --> 07:48.776
Uh, I don't know. Eat right.

07:48.786 --> 07:50.177
There's this thing called X-Fit...

07:50.187 --> 07:51.712
Blah-ba-da-blah-ba-da-blah-blah-blah.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.847
I was hoping for something
a little easier.

07:53.857 --> 07:56.317
I guess I'll just stick
to only eating seeds.

07:56.327 --> 07:57.851
You never see a fat bird.

07:57.861 --> 08:01.088
Vince, tell Mom she doesn't need to
eat seeds. She's hotter than a bird.

08:01.098 --> 08:02.356
You look good, Mom.

08:02.367 --> 08:03.991
That's a nice... woman shirt.

08:04.001 --> 08:07.094
Thank you. It was a present
last year from Gene

08:07.104 --> 08:08.462
for my 45th birthday.

08:08.472 --> 08:10.397
45th. I'm 33...

08:10.407 --> 08:13.068
And what a special age that is.

08:13.079 --> 08:14.685
So, should we head inside?

08:14.696 --> 08:16.839
Yes. The chardonnay is getting warm.

08:20.453 --> 08:22.945
So Denise, thank you again
for coming in and doing this.

08:22.955 --> 08:24.951
Is there something
I can get you to drink.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.316
- Like, coffee, tea...
- If it's not too much trouble,

08:27.326 --> 08:30.353
I'll take a margarita
and a pulled pork sandwich.

08:30.363 --> 08:32.587
Go.

08:32.597 --> 08:35.158
Uh, I can get you a water bottle

08:35.168 --> 08:37.659
or Dana's old cottage cheese.

08:37.669 --> 08:38.995
Gross.

08:39.005 --> 08:40.962
Just the cottage cheese.

08:40.972 --> 08:42.465
Okay, so let's begin.

08:42.475 --> 08:45.334
Who is Denise? What...

08:45.344 --> 08:47.233
is Denise?

08:47.244 --> 08:49.870
Okay, well, I was born in America,

08:49.880 --> 08:51.505
back when it was still America.

08:51.515 --> 08:54.809
I hate Obamacare but I love
the Affordable Care Act.

08:54.819 --> 08:57.778
And if I can bring one thing
to a desert island,

08:57.788 --> 08:59.947
it'd be a Cheesecake Factory.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.782
Next question.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.018
Interesting. Interesting.

09:04.028 --> 09:06.787
Maybe we can just try and talk about

09:06.797 --> 09:08.623
your brave weight loss journey.

09:08.633 --> 09:13.327
Well, really, what it all comes
down to is what I call CHD.

09:13.797 --> 09:15.255
What... what is that, like...

09:15.265 --> 09:19.359
Coffee, Hostess cupcakes
and taking a lot of dumps.

09:19.369 --> 09:22.496
Okay, maybe one way we can rephrase that

09:22.506 --> 09:24.465
is everything in moderation.

09:24.475 --> 09:26.200
There was nothing modern about it.

09:26.210 --> 09:29.403
Hella coffee, hella Hostess,
hella dumps.

09:29.413 --> 09:31.505
CHD.

09:33.484 --> 09:35.442
TV... just one second.

09:35.452 --> 09:37.444
Denise is a disaster.
She's making me question

09:37.454 --> 09:39.578
my love of diva behavior.

09:39.589 --> 09:41.615
Wait... do I not like Mariah Carey?

09:41.625 --> 09:44.017
Look, Michael, I'm not
usually a new agey

09:44.027 --> 09:46.887
or horoscopeo kind of guy,
but I think maybe the universe

09:46.897 --> 09:48.255
is trying to tell you to bag it

09:48.265 --> 09:50.257
and leave the old website as it is.

09:50.267 --> 09:53.126
I can't bag it. I promised
Vince I'd do a good job.

09:53.136 --> 09:54.895
And my word is my honor.

09:54.905 --> 09:56.963
Unless I have to backstab you
to get ahead.

09:56.973 --> 09:58.965
Well, though I like to think
people follow me

09:58.975 --> 10:00.901
for my thoughts
on issues like gun control...

10:00.911 --> 10:02.869
great arguments on both sides...

10:02.879 --> 10:04.871
it's probably because of how I look.

10:04.881 --> 10:07.808
That's it! Britney, you
should give her a makeover.

10:07.818 --> 10:10.310
You know, balayage,
contouring, new teeth.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.547
I'm talking "Extreme Makeover:
Home Edition" person edition.

10:13.557 --> 10:16.249
You got it.

10:16.259 --> 10:18.426
Back to work.

10:20.230 --> 10:25.446
Mmm, Gene, this Chuanbei
liangfen is to die for.

10:25.457 --> 10:27.138
Are you sure you're in
the right business?

10:27.149 --> 10:29.627
Yes, I am.

10:29.637 --> 10:32.330
The footwear industry
has been very kind to me.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.597
As I like to say...

10:39.914 --> 10:41.673
Hey, you know, it's rude when you

10:41.683 --> 10:44.003
- talk Mandarin to each other.
- Well, I don't mind.

10:44.014 --> 10:46.539
It's like a little vacation where
I don't have to pay attention.

10:46.550 --> 10:49.280
Anyway, I'm glad you reached out.

10:49.290 --> 10:51.082
- I was gonna do the same.
- Oh, yeah?

10:51.092 --> 10:52.517
You were gonna contact me?

10:52.527 --> 10:53.852
What, do you need another kidney?

10:53.862 --> 10:55.010
Ow!

10:55.021 --> 10:57.155
Uh, no. We wanted to talk
to you about managing

10:57.165 --> 11:00.158
my new shoe store location in Secaucus.

11:00.168 --> 11:02.694
It's the Albany of New Jersey!

11:02.704 --> 11:04.095
It's a great location.

11:04.105 --> 11:05.697
The store used to be a strip club.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.298
Uh, I have a job.

11:07.308 --> 11:09.100
Running Champions.
Perhaps you remember it

11:09.110 --> 11:11.395
from when the door hit you
on the way out?

11:11.406 --> 11:14.132
See, Gayle. I told you
he wouldn't wanna do it.

11:14.142 --> 11:16.067
It's not glamorous enough for him.

11:16.077 --> 11:18.403
I only see shoes in a box.

11:18.413 --> 11:21.006
- But he sees them in action.
- Yeah.

11:21.016 --> 11:23.652
Okay. I was just trying
to be a good mom.

11:23.663 --> 11:25.383
I thought you might
wanna start wearing ties

11:25.394 --> 11:28.039
with your polo shirts, now that you
have people looking up to you.

11:28.050 --> 11:29.714
Oh, I don't care what he wears.

11:29.725 --> 11:31.925
I was talking about his son.

11:33.974 --> 11:35.232
You know about Michael?

11:35.242 --> 11:36.600
Well, I suspected something was up

11:36.610 --> 11:38.168
when Matthew posted on Facebook

11:38.178 --> 11:41.838
about coming out as an uncle.

11:41.848 --> 11:44.641
Okay, so then you...
you knew you had a grandson

11:44.651 --> 11:46.343
and you just didn't reach out.

11:46.353 --> 11:48.411
- Why?
- Spare me the guilt trip.

11:48.421 --> 11:51.147
You didn't tell me I was a gra...

11:51.157 --> 11:52.515
Gra...

11:52.525 --> 11:55.255
That you had a son for 15 years.

11:55.266 --> 11:58.526
Okay, okay. Lots of emotions
flying around here.

11:58.536 --> 12:00.394
Some negative, some positive.

12:00.404 --> 12:04.298
Food's good. So let's focus
on what brought us together.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.508
A trap. I'm leaving.

12:05.519 --> 12:07.377
Thanks for nothing, Mom!

12:07.388 --> 12:09.581
- And thanks for lunch, Gene.
- Yeah.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:26.296 --> 12:30.866
Presenting, the new face of Champions.

12:30.868 --> 12:34.870
Excuse me, mamacita,
we're expecting a dowdy loser

12:34.872 --> 12:37.460
to come through here, so can you please

12:37.471 --> 12:40.505
- not block the door?
- Oh, sure, my bad.

12:40.516 --> 12:43.984
No, no, Ruby. This is Denise.

12:43.986 --> 12:45.864
You're Denise?

12:45.875 --> 12:47.533
More like De-noice.

12:47.544 --> 12:52.539
No, it's just Denise. Or Pizza Hut.

12:52.550 --> 12:55.009
<i>I knew going there was a bad idea.</i>

12:55.020 --> 12:57.278
Not only did Mom know about Michael,

12:57.289 --> 12:59.252
but now I will always
associate Chinese food

12:59.263 --> 13:00.621
with the taste of betrayal.

13:00.632 --> 13:02.458
Yeah, well, maybe Mom
feels betrayed, too.

13:02.469 --> 13:05.029
I was devastated you kept
Michael a secret for 15 years.

13:05.039 --> 13:08.365
The longest I've ever kept
a secret from you was one day.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.234
That's a lie.
It was one second, just now!

13:10.244 --> 13:12.169
Okay, how are you
still taking Mom's side?

13:12.179 --> 13:14.238
I'm your brother.
I pay your cell phone bill.

13:14.248 --> 13:15.873
I hold your hand at scary movies.

13:15.883 --> 13:19.143
- I'm scared, too, you know.
- Sir, you are only allowed

13:19.153 --> 13:21.045
to be this loud on the subway
if you're doing

13:21.055 --> 13:22.880
a choreographed dance with friends.

13:22.890 --> 13:24.314
Sorry, Officer.

13:24.324 --> 13:26.250
But, uh, just out of curiosity,

13:26.260 --> 13:28.986
what's the fine for being a mama's boy?

13:28.996 --> 13:30.554
Same as for being a tattletale.

13:30.564 --> 13:32.856
Now what's it gonna be?
You gonna behave,

13:32.866 --> 13:34.112
or you gonna dance?

13:34.138 --> 13:35.392
- Dance!
- Behave.

13:35.402 --> 13:36.660
Behave. Behave.

13:40.574 --> 13:42.499
Michael, I have terrible news.

13:42.509 --> 13:44.234
You joined the assistants union?

13:44.244 --> 13:46.403
Worse. Denise is a no-show.

13:46.413 --> 13:47.704
I texted the number she gave me,

13:47.714 --> 13:49.706
but it's an alt-right resist bot.

13:49.716 --> 13:51.275
She's gone? W-where?

13:51.285 --> 13:53.577
She can't leave New York
for parole reasons.

13:53.587 --> 13:56.113
Women! Right? Uh...

13:56.123 --> 13:59.450
- What did you do, Ruby?
- Huh? Me?

13:59.460 --> 14:02.286
Denise could've gone on a date
with anyone last night.

14:02.296 --> 14:05.389
The UPS lady... me.

14:05.399 --> 14:07.591
The UPS lady is gay?

14:07.601 --> 14:09.293
But I bought her so much jewelry.

14:09.303 --> 14:12.729
So Denise isn't here
because you had a bad date?

14:12.739 --> 14:15.432
No, it was great... physically.

14:15.442 --> 14:18.035
Mentally, it was a nightmare.

14:18.045 --> 14:20.938
I had to cannon ball
off of the Staten Island Ferry

14:20.948 --> 14:22.439
- to get away from her.
- Great.

14:22.449 --> 14:24.141
My website is ruined.

14:24.151 --> 14:25.476
I don't see what the big deal is.

14:25.486 --> 14:27.277
All right, the old site still works

14:27.287 --> 14:29.546
as long as we open it
with Netscape Navigator.

14:29.556 --> 14:31.615
Okay, the big deal is I made Vince

14:31.625 --> 14:33.450
reconnect with his mom for this.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.285
I haven't messed up his life this bad

14:35.295 --> 14:36.587
since my conception.

14:36.597 --> 14:38.489
Vince is talking to Gayle again?

14:38.499 --> 14:40.090
That woman is some piece of work.

14:40.100 --> 14:44.261
I called her ma'am one time,
my jaw still clicks.

14:44.271 --> 14:45.896
I... I promised Vince a website.

14:45.906 --> 14:48.765
And instead, I lead him
into the web of a black widow.

14:48.775 --> 14:50.687
Shabaz, write that down, it's good.

14:50.698 --> 14:53.557
I'll be in my trailer.

14:53.568 --> 14:54.793
He has a trailer?

14:54.804 --> 14:56.763
Okay, so for copyright reasons,

14:56.774 --> 14:58.553
we can't offer Crossfit,

14:58.564 --> 15:01.557
but we do have something called X-Fit.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.895
Check it out. I invented it and, uh...

15:04.906 --> 15:06.497
I'm good.

15:06.508 --> 15:08.067
Okay.

15:08.162 --> 15:09.620
What are you doing here?

15:09.630 --> 15:11.788
Well, you left this yesterday
when you stormed out

15:11.798 --> 15:14.825
- like a baby.
- Babies can't storm, Gayle.

15:14.835 --> 15:17.494
I'm tired of fighting. I spent all night

15:17.504 --> 15:19.363
thinking about what you said
and you're right.

15:19.373 --> 15:22.666
I should've reached out
when I learned you had a son.

15:22.676 --> 15:24.168
I'm sorry.

15:24.178 --> 15:25.836
You're apologizing.

15:25.846 --> 15:27.171
To me? Are you okay?

15:27.181 --> 15:28.505
Do you have a brain tumor?

15:28.515 --> 15:31.274
Has it been affecting your
personality for the last 30 years?

15:31.285 --> 15:33.510
Don't get cute, Vincent.
That's your brother's job.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.180
The truth of the matter is
that now that I am

15:36.190 --> 15:38.815
approaching early middle age,

15:38.825 --> 15:41.685
I can admit I wasn't a very good mother.

15:41.695 --> 15:45.122
Maybe I can be a better grandmother.

15:45.132 --> 15:46.751
Are you asking to meet Michael?

15:46.762 --> 15:47.876
Don't toy with me, girl.

15:47.887 --> 15:50.227
Yes. But please have him call me Gayle.

15:50.237 --> 15:51.884
I'm too young to be Grandma.

15:51.895 --> 15:53.363
And I'm not gonna call him Michael.

15:53.373 --> 15:55.199
It's too close to Matthew.
It's confusing.

15:55.209 --> 15:57.524
Hey, that's not my fault.
I wanted you to name him Kirk.

15:57.535 --> 16:00.737
Kirk Cook? It sounds like
you're clearing your throat.

16:00.747 --> 16:03.574
Mom, be cool!
You were finally getting along.

16:03.584 --> 16:06.376
All right. How about if
I come by tomorrow?

16:06.386 --> 16:08.954
- Yes!
- Sounds good.

16:15.829 --> 16:18.545
All right, Mom's gonna be here soon.
Did you hide the Obama poster?

16:18.556 --> 16:21.104
I put a mustache on it.
She'll think it's Steve Harvey.

16:22.335 --> 16:24.736
Hey, Vince, this really means a lot.

16:24.747 --> 16:27.106
I'm sorry I couldn't hold up
my end of the deal.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.944
But if it's any consolation,

16:28.955 --> 16:30.279
it's all Ruby's fault.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.249
Hey, I was out of your life
for 15 years.

16:32.421 --> 16:34.179
We good.

16:34.189 --> 16:35.948
All right, that's her. How do I look?

16:35.958 --> 16:37.349
Uh, let's see. Weird hair,

16:37.359 --> 16:39.051
messed up cheek bones,
huge Adam's apple,

16:39.061 --> 16:42.020
long torso, patchy eyebrows...
the usual.

16:42.775 --> 16:44.067
Hello!

16:44.078 --> 16:46.739
Gene. So you're just an automatic invite

16:46.750 --> 16:48.375
to all family things now.

16:48.386 --> 16:50.244
That's cool, I guess.

16:50.255 --> 16:53.015
Oh, hello. You must be Michael.

16:53.026 --> 16:55.600
I'm Gene Yu. I'm your step-grandfather.

16:55.611 --> 16:58.303
And where is the lady of the hour?

16:58.313 --> 17:00.754
Oh, is she going
to make a grand entrance?

17:00.765 --> 17:02.089
I already love her.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.358
- What song should I queue?
- Unfortunately,

17:04.369 --> 17:07.211
Gayle will not be dining
with us this afternoon.

17:07.222 --> 17:09.348
She was very excited to come.

17:09.358 --> 17:12.185
But got too tired
after all her injectables.

17:12.263 --> 17:15.339
But why? If she looked
any younger, she'd be a baby.

17:15.349 --> 17:17.117
Matthew, it's not the
injectables, all right?

17:17.128 --> 17:19.473
Gayle couldn't face
the fact that she's a grandma,

17:19.483 --> 17:20.541
so she bailed.

17:20.553 --> 17:23.973
Right? Just like she bailed on Dad's
funeral and my ninth birthday.

17:23.983 --> 17:25.497
Chuck E. Cheese had to drive me home.

17:25.507 --> 17:27.132
- Oh.
- God, I can't believe

17:27.142 --> 17:28.207
I ever blamed you, Vince.

17:28.218 --> 17:29.699
It was Mom's fault the whole time.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.199
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:31.210 --> 17:33.444
I need to go update our status
to complicated.

17:35.067 --> 17:36.492
I understand why you're angry,

17:36.502 --> 17:38.694
but your mother got married very young

17:38.704 --> 17:40.195
and didn't have many options.

17:40.205 --> 17:42.998
And learning that she has
a grandson just reminded her

17:43.008 --> 17:45.935
of all the things that
she hasn't accomplished.

17:45.945 --> 17:47.503
Huh. I hadn't thought of that.

17:47.513 --> 17:49.705
Too bad she couldn't
tell me that in person.

17:49.715 --> 17:53.108
My point is, though she
wasn't meant to be a parent,

17:53.118 --> 17:55.452
clearly, you and Matthew are.

17:56.588 --> 17:58.614
They haven't killed me yet.

17:58.624 --> 18:01.216
Okay, I have to go.
I have to pick up Gayle.

18:01.226 --> 18:03.485
She hopped out of the car
three blocks away.

18:03.495 --> 18:05.988
Oh, and Gene, I'm always here

18:05.998 --> 18:08.123
whenever Grandma feels ready
to kiss the ring.

18:08.133 --> 18:10.793
Yes. Though she prefers Gayle.

18:10.803 --> 18:15.397
Oh, does she?

18:15.407 --> 18:16.699
Sorry, Gene.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.000
I did that for effect.

18:18.010 --> 18:19.635
You seem really nice.

18:19.645 --> 18:22.471
<i>I understand. Bye.</i>

18:25.150 --> 18:27.743
Hey, I, uh, saw the picture
you posted of Mom

18:27.753 --> 18:29.812
with no makeup on Facebook.

18:29.822 --> 18:31.380
- Bold.
- Yeah, I felt so bad

18:31.390 --> 18:33.087
I instantly commented, "Hubba, hubba."

18:33.098 --> 18:34.749
I'm just too good
at seeing the best in people.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.052
Did you know Vladimir Putin
has a dog named Buffy?

18:37.062 --> 18:39.421
- I mean, how cute is that?
- Hey, being nice

18:39.431 --> 18:41.256
is way better than
always being mad at people.

18:41.266 --> 18:43.258
I mean, Gene came here
to do a decent thing

18:43.268 --> 18:44.927
and I'm still like, no gift for Michael?

18:44.937 --> 18:46.663
You own a shoe store, son.

18:46.674 --> 18:47.929
You know, for what it's worth,

18:47.940 --> 18:50.245
I think that's why I'm more
forgiving of Mom than you are.

18:50.256 --> 18:51.644
Well, that and she always called me

18:51.655 --> 18:53.435
her flawless angel
too perfect to look at.

18:53.445 --> 18:56.171
And my nickname was "Not now, Vincent."

18:56.181 --> 18:57.606
- I know.
- Still, man,

18:57.616 --> 19:00.409
whenever Mom bailed on us,
I never really noticed

19:00.419 --> 19:02.177
because you were always there for me.

19:02.187 --> 19:05.381
Just you, my teddy bear Vince
and my imaginary friend,

19:05.391 --> 19:07.616
- Vince the teddy bear.
- Right, what you're saying

19:07.626 --> 19:11.353
is that in a twisted way,
we have her to thank

19:11.363 --> 19:15.514
for making us so close.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.066
Hey, hey, what's everyone doing here?

19:19.077 --> 19:21.130
That homeless guy,
he's posing as a trainer again.

19:21.140 --> 19:22.968
We finished the website for Michael.

19:22.979 --> 19:25.694
Most of our audience will be wondering
where the animals are,.

19:25.705 --> 19:26.746
but it's fine.

19:26.757 --> 19:29.468
Champions has finally
entered the 21st century.

19:29.479 --> 19:31.705
Ah... the 20th century.

19:31.716 --> 19:33.274
How'd you get Pizza Hut back?

19:33.285 --> 19:35.077
Who? Wait, what is happening?

19:35.087 --> 19:37.946
What's happening is I finally got
a legit movie credit, all right?

19:37.956 --> 19:39.448
"Special thanks to."

19:39.458 --> 19:43.210
So now the world will know
Shabaz has gone showbiz!

19:43.221 --> 19:45.562
Also, Uncle Bud got Ruby to
keep dating Denise or whatever.

19:45.573 --> 19:47.765
Who cares? It's stupid
I did the most important thing.

19:47.776 --> 19:49.558
No one has clarified anything.

19:49.568 --> 19:51.460
Just watch the movie and after that,

19:51.470 --> 19:53.630
the only question you'll have
is, "Can we play it again?"

19:53.641 --> 19:56.899
And the answer is no,
the system is still glitchy.

19:56.909 --> 19:58.634
<i>Hi, I'm Denise</i>

19:58.644 --> 20:02.738
and joining Champions is the
best decision I ever made.

20:02.748 --> 20:04.506
<i>I lost 80 pounds,</i>

20:04.516 --> 20:06.675
<i>thanks to their
state-of-the-art facility</i>

20:06.685 --> 20:10.979
and a little something
I like to call CHD.

20:10.989 --> 20:13.015
What's CHD, you ask?

20:14.827 --> 20:18.687
<i>And using these three steps,
I transformed myself</i>

20:18.697 --> 20:21.523
from a worm into the beautiful butterfly

20:21.533 --> 20:22.860
that I am today.

20:22.871 --> 20:27.333
In fact, Champions hasn't
just given me a new body.

20:27.895 --> 20:30.721
It's given me a new partner.

20:30.732 --> 20:32.423
Uh... uh, hey.

20:32.644 --> 20:35.537
<i>Ruby, I know I've only
been living at your place</i>

20:35.547 --> 20:38.373
<i>- for a few days...
- Feels like forever.</i>

20:38.383 --> 20:40.042
But would you do me the honor

20:40.052 --> 20:42.945
of assuming half of my many debts?

20:42.955 --> 20:45.188
What the...

20:46.091 --> 20:47.743
Awesome, dude!

20:47.754 --> 20:49.051
You are a good director.

20:49.061 --> 20:50.152
My little Michael Bay.

20:50.162 --> 20:51.386
Uh, my name is Michael

20:51.396 --> 20:53.263
and I am bae, but how dare you?

20:53.274 --> 20:54.770
Also, thank you.

20:54.781 --> 20:57.658
Though, honestly, these guys
did most of the work.

20:57.669 --> 20:59.561
And special shout out to Uncle Bud.

20:59.571 --> 21:01.029
It's nice to know that there are

21:01.039 --> 21:02.731
some old people that can be relied on.

21:02.741 --> 21:04.366
I saw what it meant to you, Michael.

21:04.376 --> 21:05.400
And it felt good.

21:05.410 --> 21:07.069
I never had children myself.

21:07.079 --> 21:09.338
In fact, that old website's
the only thing I ever made

21:09.348 --> 21:10.839
that I thought would outlive me.

21:10.849 --> 21:13.509
- Jeez.
- Well, if you're interested,

21:13.519 --> 21:16.078
I think I know another way
you can help me out.

21:17.589 --> 21:20.516
So there I was, surrounded by Viet Cong.

21:20.526 --> 21:23.085
Hundreds of miles behind enemy lines.

21:23.095 --> 21:24.920
My company assumed I was dead.

21:24.930 --> 21:27.189
Little did they know
that I was bartending

21:27.199 --> 21:29.057
at a strip joint in Hanoi.

21:29.067 --> 21:31.360
Man, did those girls teach me a lot.

21:31.371 --> 21:33.440
Now, I say girls, but...
