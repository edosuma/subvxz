WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.803
- What's this bar
we're going to tonight?

00:02.836 --> 00:05.706
- Eh, some place Liz picked.
- Yeah, you know the address?

00:05.739 --> 00:07.408
- Uh, she texted it to me.

00:07.441 --> 00:11.179
It's just in my phone there.
- Thanks, bro.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.846
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

00:12.880 --> 00:14.748
"Preparing for anal sex."
Dude!

00:14.782 --> 00:16.384
- Whoa, no, no, no.
(stammers)

00:16.417 --> 00:18.152
That's-that's a very...
that's personal.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.221
- Are you and Lucy
thinking about...

00:20.254 --> 00:22.490
- It's just between us, so...
- Joshua!

00:22.523 --> 00:25.359
I am so proud of you, man.
-(chuckles) Thanks.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.261
I mean, it's just something
we're talking about vaguely.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.263
- Shh, shh, shh,
this is my best friend

00:29.297 --> 00:31.432
taking the big leap
with the woman he loves.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.334
I-I always knew
this day would come.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.169
I just didn't know when.
- Thanks, man.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.437
(laughs)

00:36.470 --> 00:38.506
It just... the timing
just feels right.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.940
You know?
I just-I can't picture

00:39.973 --> 00:42.376
doing it with anyone else, so...
- OMG.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.844
Look at me.
I got goose bumps all over.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.513
-(laughs)
- So, what, you did the whole

00:45.546 --> 00:47.515
"ask the dad" thing?
- What?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.683
No.
- Dude, you have to ask the dad

00:49.717 --> 00:51.452
for his blessing.
It's tradition.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.520
- Yeah?

00:52.553 --> 00:55.523
I mean, it just seems kind of

00:55.556 --> 00:57.225
like a personal thing
with Lucy and me.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.261
- No.
Dude, asking the dad is classy.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.363
Trust me.
Any chick would back me up.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.864
Ask Liz.
- No!

01:03.897 --> 01:06.600
I-I don't want to
ask my sister about this.

01:06.634 --> 01:07.801
- First of all, mazel.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.470
Secondly, Josh is right.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.805
Asking for her father's
permission is sexist

01:11.839 --> 01:13.774
and outdated.
- Exactly.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.743
I mean, it's- it's
kind of creepy, right?

01:15.776 --> 01:17.211
- It's totally creepy.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.379
If Lucy wants
to take this step with you,

01:18.412 --> 01:19.747
it is up to her.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.149
You don't need
to beg an old man's approval.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.784
- See?
Thank you.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.386
- Now, that said...
- Oh, no.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.787
- Mm.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.290
- Aren't her parents
kind of old-fashioned?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.792
- Kinda.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.895
- Then you have to ask.
- Yes.

01:34.928 --> 01:35.929
(glasses clink)

01:44.638 --> 01:47.275
- Oh, g-good day, Mr. Parker.
- How are you?

01:47.308 --> 01:48.776
I see you looking at my rifle.
- Yeah.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.578
- Can't blame you.
She's a beauty.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.248
Lethal, but a beauty.
Yes, sir.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.450
Take care of your rifle,
it'll take care of you.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.352
I learned that in the Marines.
- Oh.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.587
- You learn a lot
in the Marines.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.356
You learn to kill,
to end life.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.592
You learn what it's like to see
the light go out in a man's eyes

02:04.625 --> 02:07.295
moments after
you shot him close up.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.630
In a way,
you learn to love it.

02:09.663 --> 02:13.301
- Uh, yeah, that's, uh, neat.
Uh, thank you for your service.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.868
- Have a seat.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.870
Let's hear it, Josh.
What can I do ya for?

02:16.904 --> 02:20.308
- Well, um, Mr. Parker,

02:20.341 --> 02:22.210
uh, as-as I'm sure you know,

02:22.243 --> 02:23.777
I-I care a great deal
for your daughter.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.280
I'm-I'm crazy about her.
I... I love her.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.548
I love her
with everything in me,

02:27.581 --> 02:29.217
and, uh,

02:29.250 --> 02:33.521
I-I would very much like if,
um...

02:33.554 --> 02:34.522
sorry.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.624
(exhales)

02:36.657 --> 02:38.859
Um...

02:38.892 --> 02:40.661
it-it would-it would make me

02:40.694 --> 02:43.631
the happiest man in the world,

02:43.664 --> 02:47.668
um, if I could have anal sex
with your daughter.

02:50.871 --> 02:54.375
Mr. Parker, cou...
Did you hear what I said or...

02:54.408 --> 02:55.376
(thump)

02:55.409 --> 02:57.645
- You dare come in here,

02:57.678 --> 02:59.847
into my home,

02:59.880 --> 03:01.815
ask me that,

03:01.849 --> 03:03.384
and not call me dad?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.652
- Oh!
-(laughs)

03:04.685 --> 03:05.886
Josh, course,
you have my blessing.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.154
- Oh, my God,
thank you too, sir.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.323
- Hey, Carolyn, get in here!

03:09.357 --> 03:11.325
- Did he ask the question?
- Just now.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.160
- Oh, my God.
-(chuckles)

03:13.193 --> 03:14.695
- I had a feeling
that you would.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.397
- Oh, yeah... (laughs)

03:16.430 --> 03:17.565
- God, that was brave
of you, son.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.267
Really brave.
Yes, I remember

03:19.300 --> 03:20.834
when I had to ask
Carolyn's father.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.236
Boy, I was nervous.
Sweating bullets.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.671
- Yeah.
- He grilled me.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.774
- Josh, can you call us
the minute you do it?

03:26.807 --> 03:29.443
- Oh, absolutely.
- And if you could possibly,

03:29.477 --> 03:32.179
possibly manage it, pictures.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.515
- Yeah, of course, Mrs. Parker.
- For Pete's sakes,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.183
call me Carolyn.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.387
You're about to
(bleep) my daughter

03:39.420 --> 03:42.423
in the (bleep) till your
(bleep) falls off.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.425
(laughter)

03:44.458 --> 03:46.193
- Oh, and, uh...

03:46.226 --> 03:48.596
I-I would also like to ask,
uh, Lucy to marry me.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.730
- Oh, cool.
- Whatever.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.231
Go for it.

03:51.265 --> 03:54.234
(downtempo electronic music)

03:54.268 --> 03:55.235
*

03:55.269 --> 03:56.570
- Ah!

03:56.604 --> 03:59.807
*

03:59.840 --> 04:01.809
-(squeaks)

04:01.842 --> 04:03.577
*

04:03.611 --> 04:04.912
-(growls)

04:04.945 --> 04:06.947
*

04:21.295 --> 04:23.230
- Here you are, sir.
-(gasps)

04:23.263 --> 04:25.733
There it is.
That's the one.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.301
Ah, thank you so much
for your help.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.937
You truly are
a master of jewels.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.572
-(chuckles)
- I can't believe

04:31.605 --> 04:33.641
I'm finally gonna
ask her to marry me.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.610
- You got something big planned?
- I got a little something

04:36.644 --> 04:38.446
up my sleeve for this weekend.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.914
- Good for you.
So many guys blow it.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.350
- Uh-huh.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.584
- You know,
you only get one shot

04:43.617 --> 04:45.519
at a romantic moment like this.
- Yep.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.521
- One shot
for the rest of your life.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.357
- Yeah, I'm aware.
Can I just have the bag?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.291
- You know, the last thing
you want to do is squander it.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.361
- I really think
you're being overly dramatic.

04:53.394 --> 04:57.297
Uh, it's not that much pressure.

04:57.331 --> 05:00.300
(dramatic music)

05:00.334 --> 05:03.303
NARRATOR: In the most
anticipated event of the year,

05:03.337 --> 05:04.705
it's all...

05:04.738 --> 05:06.039
been leading...

05:06.073 --> 05:08.809
up to this.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.279
Josh's Proposal.
Coming this weekend.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.314
(cheers and applause)

05:14.348 --> 05:16.384
CROWD:
Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh!

05:16.417 --> 05:17.818
Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh!

05:17.851 --> 05:18.886
- How cool was that?

05:18.919 --> 05:21.455
(cheers and applause)

05:21.489 --> 05:23.891
Well, we have a special guest
with us today.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.526
He's a guy we all know

05:25.559 --> 05:28.529
is gonna knock this proposal
out of the park.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.398
Please welcome Josh!

05:30.431 --> 05:32.466
(cheers and applause)

05:32.500 --> 05:34.835
- Oh, holy shit.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.806
- I love you!
I love you!

05:38.839 --> 05:41.575
- Josh, buddy,
uh, can you leak anything

05:41.609 --> 05:42.976
about the proposal this weekend?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.713
Uh, give us some spoilers.
I mean, we need to know

05:45.746 --> 05:46.847
how it's going down.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.716
- I don't know

05:48.749 --> 05:50.384
if I should.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.385
- Just tell us
a little something.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.553
- All right, okay.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.588
Maybe-maybe I could just,

05:54.622 --> 05:57.391
you know, divulge
a wee bit of info.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.426
- Yeah?
- You know-yeah.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.928
- Well, this is amazing.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.331
- All right, uh, two words:

06:04.364 --> 06:06.534
low-key.

06:09.570 --> 06:14.341
Uh, so the plan is
to surprise Lucy at breakfast.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.244
(microphone feedback)
Uh, I'm gonna make her,

06:17.277 --> 06:19.680
uh, eggs and pecan pancakes,

06:19.713 --> 06:21.615
uh, which is her favorite,

06:21.649 --> 06:23.784
uh, breakfast.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.620
Uh, uh, when she's done eating,

06:26.654 --> 06:28.789
uh, said breakfast,

06:28.822 --> 06:31.291
I'll ask her,
uh, "Do you want seconds?"

06:31.324 --> 06:32.760
And when she goes, "Yeah,"

06:32.793 --> 06:34.462
I'll give her a plate
with the ring on it,

06:34.495 --> 06:35.896
and I'll go,

06:35.929 --> 06:37.431
"Hope you like carats."

06:37.465 --> 06:38.866
(microphone feedback)

06:38.899 --> 06:42.636
Because, uh, you know,
carrots are a vegetable

06:42.670 --> 06:45.739
that you could eat,
but it also re-refers

06:45.773 --> 06:48.776
to the caliber of the diamonds.
- Yeah.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.379
- What?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.782
- Okay, I guess we'll
open it up to questions.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.884
- Yeah, hi!
- Yeah, okay.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.319
Yeah, hi.
- Hi, I came from Tampa.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.623
- Oh, cool.
- 400 miles.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.324
I drove.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.259
- Well, uh, thank you
for making the trip up.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.997
- Uh, this proposal...

07:10.030 --> 07:12.733
is...

07:12.766 --> 07:14.401
it's not good.
(audience murmurs)

07:14.434 --> 07:15.736
It's poorly conceived.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.270
It's a sad rehash

07:17.304 --> 07:19.607
of 1,000 proposals
I've seen before.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.742
I think we can all say
it's-it's a letdown.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.912
- Oh, well, I mean, I just...
Obviously, I disagree.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.582
- Bungee jumping,
skydiving, flash mob,

07:28.616 --> 07:31.752
these are all better ideas
than your idea

07:31.785 --> 07:34.121
and I just came up with them
off the top of my head.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.823
Who greenlit this, huh?

07:35.856 --> 07:37.457
Jar Jar Binks dickhole?

07:37.491 --> 07:39.493
- Listen.
I'm doing the best I can.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.028
- Doesn't feel like that.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.496
It feels like the Holocaust.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.864
- Hey.
- Whoa.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.133
- You are ruining
millions of people's lives.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.501
- Oh, I see.
(scattered applause)

07:47.535 --> 07:48.769
- I mean, this is bullshit!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.871
(cheers and applause)

07:50.904 --> 07:52.640
- As much as I agree with you...
- What?

07:52.673 --> 07:53.974
- I think you better sit down.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.643
- Yeah, I think
you should sit down.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.611
- That's a good idea
'cause I like to sit down

07:57.645 --> 07:58.846
when I get (bleep).

07:58.879 --> 08:02.616
(crowd cheering)

08:02.650 --> 08:04.117
- There's a kitchen nearby.
- Yeah?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.619
- I'd sneak out through there.
- Understood.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.655
- Yeah.
I'll cover for you.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.823
Go.
- Okay.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.526
- Pecan pancakes and eggs.
-(chuckles)

08:12.560 --> 08:14.962
- You are so sweet for cooking.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.196
- I love you.
Thank you.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.031
I'll do the dishes.
- I... Uh, thanks.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.634
Uh...

08:20.668 --> 08:21.802
cool, cool.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.204
(stammering)

08:24.237 --> 08:26.473
Lucy, there's something
that's been on my mind,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.475
uh, as of late.
- What's up?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.711
- I think

08:30.744 --> 08:34.147
we should, uh...

08:34.181 --> 08:36.984
- Hmm?
- Get a dishwasher.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.018
- Sure.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.689
- Maybe. I don't know,

08:41.722 --> 08:43.691
but, uh, just...

08:43.724 --> 08:45.392
(garbage disposal grinding)

08:48.061 --> 08:49.697
- So, okay,
I tried putting the ring

08:49.730 --> 08:51.599
in, like, a fortune cookie,
but it doesn't fit.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.067
It breaks every single time.
Just crumbles.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.736
- Josh, relax.
You're overthinking this.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.371
- I don't think I am.
I get one shot at this.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.707
One shot at this. I don't
want to mess it up.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.508
- Move on.
You'll be fine.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.243
Honestly, I think you're putting
way too much time into this.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.379
- I just figure,
what's the rush, right?

09:06.413 --> 09:08.682
It's not like Lucy
suspects anything.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.618
(playful dramatic music)

09:10.651 --> 09:12.252
- Watson,

09:12.285 --> 09:13.420
we have a case.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.889
- A case!
Oh!

09:15.923 --> 09:17.390
Is it missing jewels?

09:17.424 --> 09:20.193
A curious string
of poisoned widows?

09:20.227 --> 09:23.296
- It's something
far more exhilarating.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.865
I suspect

09:24.898 --> 09:28.235
Josh Greenberg is going
to propose to me.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.569
- By Jove!

09:29.603 --> 09:31.471
However did you come
to such a conclusion?

09:31.504 --> 09:33.573
- Clues, dear Watson, clues.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.610
Clues which to an untrained mind
may appear meaningless,

09:36.644 --> 09:39.146
but to my intelligent
girlfriend brain,

09:39.179 --> 09:40.580
the signs
are all quite apparent.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.415
Let us first consider,

09:42.449 --> 09:45.653
two weeks ago I found a
mysterious crumpled shopping bag

09:45.686 --> 09:47.621
from a nearby jeweler
in our trash can.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.256
- That bag could be
for anything.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.591
Perhaps Josh simply bought you
a random present.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.762
- Watson, Josh doesn't
buy me random presents.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.764
He has very little income
and he's incredibly cheap.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.298
He would only part
with his money

09:58.331 --> 09:59.767
if it was absolutely
societally necessary.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.235
Therefore, I can only conclude
that he purchased...

10:02.269 --> 10:03.570
an engagement ring.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.773
-(laughs)
By Jove.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.607
An inspired deduction.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.276
- There were other subtle clues
as well.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.610
- Pray tell, pray tell.
- Last week,

10:10.644 --> 10:13.246
I walked in
on our very own Joshua

10:13.280 --> 10:16.249
practicing getting down
on one knee.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.951
*

10:17.985 --> 10:19.953
- That's not so subtle.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.454
- Yeah, I know.

10:21.488 --> 10:22.790
He told me
he was practicing doing,

10:22.823 --> 10:25.525
um, lunges for a marathon
that he signed up for,

10:25.558 --> 10:27.294
but he doesn't run.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.763
Like, not at all, so...

10:29.797 --> 10:30.964
- Hm.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.800
- Then...

10:32.833 --> 10:35.335
this morning,

10:35.368 --> 10:38.271
I watched Josh hide the ring

10:38.305 --> 10:40.808
in our underwear drawer.
- You saw the ring?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.509
- Yeah, he actually
didn't even check to see

10:42.542 --> 10:43.777
if I was in the room,
he just, like, took it out,

10:43.811 --> 10:45.212
and I was right there,

10:45.245 --> 10:47.480
um, and then when he saw me

10:47.514 --> 10:49.549
he said, "Lucy, hey.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.352
"How was your ring... day?
I meant, how was your day?

10:52.385 --> 10:53.987
How was your engagement day?
Shit."

10:54.021 --> 10:56.456
- That one's hard to miss.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.557
- Yeah.
- Mm.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.526
- Kinda.

10:59.559 --> 11:02.529
It's not my most
challenging case.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.698
I suppose the real mystery isn't

11:04.732 --> 11:07.500
if Josh will propose...

11:07.534 --> 11:09.169
it's when.
(cell phone chimes)

11:09.202 --> 11:11.304
Sorry about this.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.540
Of course, it'll be tonight,

11:13.573 --> 11:15.809
and what better place
than the wine bar

11:15.843 --> 11:19.312
where we had our first date?
- Oh, by Jove!

11:19.346 --> 11:20.981
- It's all coming together,
Watson.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.984
There's so much to do.
There's so much to prepare.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.720
Watson, the game is afoot!

11:26.754 --> 11:28.188
- Ha, ha!

11:28.221 --> 11:30.257
(soft music)

11:30.290 --> 11:31.859
- Is this the wine we had
on our first date?

11:31.892 --> 11:33.861
- Ye-Yes it is, yup.
- Oh.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.863
Gosh, and here we are again,
huh?

11:35.896 --> 11:38.999
Just, uh... just full circle.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.400
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.769
- Yep, mm-hmm.
-(chuckles softly)

11:45.605 --> 11:46.573
(clears throat)

11:46.606 --> 11:48.208
- Oh, are you getting sick?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.409
- No.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.710
No, no, I was just...
I was clearing my...

11:50.744 --> 11:52.512
my, um... my throat.
-(laughs nervously)

11:52.545 --> 11:55.783
Yeah, I love doing that.
That's such a neat feeling.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.918
(metal clatters)
Ah, Jesus, sorry, sorry.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.553
I didn't mean to, uh...
- Josh...

12:00.587 --> 12:02.222
-(sighs)
I'm sorry, I didn't...

12:02.255 --> 12:03.356
- Josh, hey, hey.
-(groans)

12:03.390 --> 12:04.424
- Sweetie.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.594
Relax.
Everything's perfect.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.763
- Lucy, there's something
I need to tell you.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.231
(sighs)

12:11.264 --> 12:13.233
Um...
-(sighs)

12:13.266 --> 12:15.735
Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:15.769 --> 12:16.904
(exhales slowly)

12:16.937 --> 12:20.808
*

12:20.841 --> 12:22.810
I have to go to the bathroom.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.812
- Okay.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.413
- Just, uh... Yup.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.249
Hold a... Put a pin...
pin in that.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.784
- Okay.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.921
(door closes)

12:41.461 --> 12:43.330
-(exhales)

12:47.968 --> 12:49.336
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.538
- Hi.
-(high-pitched) Hi.

12:52.806 --> 12:56.276
Yeah.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.279
So...

12:59.312 --> 13:00.948
- So...

13:00.981 --> 13:05.285
*

13:05.318 --> 13:07.620
- Hector.
- Yeah, uh, hmm.

13:07.654 --> 13:10.824
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.460
Wine's good.
It's very grape-y.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.463
- Yeah.
Yeah, it is-it is that, yeah.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.831
- In a word.
- Mm-hmm.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.638
-(groans softly)

13:25.672 --> 13:28.341
Oof.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.943
So...

13:29.977 --> 13:31.344
*

13:31.378 --> 13:33.213
- So?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.983
- I should get the bill,
I think,

13:36.016 --> 13:37.650
and...

13:37.684 --> 13:41.554
you and I can call it a night.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.890
- Sure.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.625
- So, you know, if we hurry,

13:45.658 --> 13:46.894
I think we can catch the bus.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.962
- I actually think
I'm gonna go for a walk.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.463
- Uh, how come?
- I don't know.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.199
I need some air.
- Okay, wa-wait.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.367
I can walk with you.
- I'll see you at home, Josh.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.702
- Okay.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.541
- LUCY: So we have a new
mystery, Watson.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.709
- Oh!

14:02.742 --> 14:04.511
- Why didn't Josh
propose tonight?

14:04.544 --> 14:05.812
He had everything.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.380
Motive, opportunity...

14:07.414 --> 14:08.916
- It was probably just nerves.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.918
- Mm-mmm, nope.
That's not it.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.053
He didn't propose
'cause he didn't want to.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.055
'Cause I... I suck.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.991
- Oh, no, I would not make
such a bold conclusion.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.726
- Mm-hmm, I have a weird nose

14:19.759 --> 14:21.661
and split ends
and I don't play an instrument.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.063
I don't pay attention
to current events,

14:23.096 --> 14:26.533
and I'm a sad, weird,
annoying girl

14:26.566 --> 14:27.901
and I wouldn't
want to marry me either.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.069
There we go.
Mystery solved.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.570
Case closed.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.940
- It seems your powers
of deduction are clouded

14:32.973 --> 14:34.407
by insecurity.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.775
He was clearly nervous.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.911
- Shut the (bleep)
up, Watson,

14:37.945 --> 14:39.612
you stupid
sack of shit!

14:39.646 --> 14:41.381
What do you even do?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.183
If I fired you right now,

14:43.216 --> 14:44.717
what would it say
on your résumé?

14:44.751 --> 14:46.419
"Sat around and said
dumb shit all day?"

14:46.453 --> 14:47.720
"I'm Watson.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.056
(cackles mockingly)
"By Jove, by Jove.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.690
I've got my dick stuck
in a bottle."

14:50.723 --> 14:52.725
(cackles mockingly)
-(crying)

14:52.759 --> 14:54.928
- Are you crying?
- I'm scared.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.863
- Oh, my God, dude...
(scoffs)

14:56.896 --> 14:58.966
You are so fired.
-(groans)

14:58.999 --> 15:00.867
(door opens)

15:00.900 --> 15:02.702
- Hey, hey, hey.
Where-where were you?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.037
I was-I was worried.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.205
-(scoffs)
- Wait.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.040
What's that?
- Listen.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.542
If you don't want to marry me
just-just say so.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.144
- How-how did you know
that I was...

15:11.178 --> 15:13.213
- You're not exactly
a criminal mastermind, Josh.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.614
-(quietly)
I-I... Yikes.

15:14.647 --> 15:15.715
- I've known for weeks,

15:15.748 --> 15:17.150
and then you didn't propose,

15:17.184 --> 15:18.952
and then I thought tonight
with the-the stuff,

15:18.986 --> 15:20.220
and now I feel like an idiot.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.888
- No, okay, I'm-I'm sorry.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.656
Tonight I hesitated.
- Yeah, right.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.725
Well, maybe there's a reason
you're hesitating.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.794
Maybe you don't want to marry
me. - No, no, no, no, no, no,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.762
no, Lucy,
I do want to marry you.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.231
- If you really wanted
to propose,

15:31.264 --> 15:32.565
Josh, you would have
done it already.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.067
- Well, excuse me

15:34.101 --> 15:36.236
for trying to be romantic,
all right.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.238
There's a lot of pressure.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.939
I-I just-I just want

15:39.973 --> 15:41.808
the timing to be right.
- How about right now?

15:41.841 --> 15:43.643
Does right now work
for you as a time?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.145
Because I wouldn't want to
interrupt your video game!

15:45.178 --> 15:48.181
- Right now is the perfect time.
- Good.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.583
That's a great hiding place.
The couch where we never sit.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.820
- Well, here I am,
and, uh, dear Lucy,

15:53.853 --> 15:55.655
blah, blah, blah.
Will you marry me?

15:55.688 --> 15:57.624
- Oh, Josh, yeah.
It would be an honor.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.692
- Great!
- Great!

15:59.726 --> 16:00.994
(door slams)

16:04.231 --> 16:05.832
(soft dramatic music)

16:08.668 --> 16:10.670
- Josh, are you sleeping?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.705
- No.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.382
I'm-I'm sorry about last night.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.652
- No, I'm...
I'm sorry.

16:25.685 --> 16:29.356
- That-that was
the worst proposal ever.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.890
- Yep.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.559
- We had our, uh,

16:32.592 --> 16:36.496
one shot at a big,
once-in-a-lifetime moment

16:36.529 --> 16:39.399
and we blew it.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.902
- Yup.
(laughs softly)

16:42.935 --> 16:45.872
- What-what do we do now?

16:45.905 --> 16:47.374
-(sighs)

16:48.608 --> 16:49.909
I could really go for, like,

16:49.942 --> 16:51.944
an egg and cheese bagel.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.416
- Hmm.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.352
(gentle electric guitar music)

16:59.386 --> 17:02.889
*

17:02.922 --> 17:04.624
-(clears throat)

17:07.627 --> 17:10.663
Lucille Montgomery Parker,

17:10.697 --> 17:13.733
will you please go for
an egg and cheese bagel with me?

17:13.766 --> 17:16.569
*

17:16.603 --> 17:18.771
- Yeah, I would love to.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.278
- Hey, you know,
we're right next to

17:25.312 --> 17:27.614
that sunglasses place we like.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.649
*

17:33.052 --> 17:36.256
- Joshua Howard Greenberg,

17:36.289 --> 17:38.258
will you go to that
sunglasses place we like?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.626
- It would be my honor.

17:39.659 --> 17:40.727
*

17:40.760 --> 17:42.061
-(laughs softly)

17:44.431 --> 17:45.532
- Here we go.
- Ready?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.467
(both humming)

17:47.500 --> 17:48.768
- Very attractive.
-(laughs)

17:48.801 --> 17:50.370
- That was super,
super attractive.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.772
- Want to smoke a joint
and go to the movies with me?

17:52.805 --> 17:54.774
- Yes, I do.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.043
- Yeah.(both laugh)

17:57.076 --> 17:59.479
- Hey, hey, hey, um,
do you want to go to

17:59.512 --> 18:01.414
that record store where they
have a really good jazz section

18:01.448 --> 18:03.450
and then leave when we remember
we don't like jazz?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.652
- I would love to.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.754
*

18:07.787 --> 18:09.489
- You want to sit in
comfortable silence

18:09.522 --> 18:12.058
while I read a magazine
and you read an actual book?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.760
- That sounds nice.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.663
*

18:16.696 --> 18:19.466
- Hey, um...

18:19.499 --> 18:20.967
will you keep me company
while I brush my teeth

18:21.000 --> 18:22.435
and tell me all the interesting
things you've read

18:22.469 --> 18:25.572
on the Internet lately?
- Yes.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.073
And that's why
self-driving cars

18:27.106 --> 18:29.342
are right around the corner.

18:29.376 --> 18:33.079
- Will you always be
my best friend?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.113
- Always.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.149
*

18:41.154 --> 18:43.856
- * You know the way *

18:43.890 --> 18:46.793
* To my heart *

18:46.826 --> 18:49.462
*

18:54.133 --> 18:56.369
- So have you worked

18:56.403 --> 18:58.205
in the food industry before?

18:58.238 --> 19:01.474
- No, but I am
a very desperate man.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.644
My last employer fired me
rather suddenly.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.646
- Whoa, is this part right?

19:06.679 --> 19:09.349
It says here under "education"
that you're a doctor?

19:09.382 --> 19:12.219
- Yes, yes, that's correct.
Dr. Watson.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.720
(chuckles)
- But wait.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.688
Under work experience
it just says,

19:15.722 --> 19:18.291
"Sat around
and said dumb shit all day"

19:18.325 --> 19:20.393
for, like, decades.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.895
- Yes.
(clears throat)

19:22.929 --> 19:25.665
- Well, I-I guess
you can be the janitor.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.667
So here's the situation:

19:27.700 --> 19:29.236
some guy
really wrecked it in there.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.037
I mean, he wrecked it.

19:31.070 --> 19:34.140
Our last guy, Hector,
took one look and he quit.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.309
He hightailed it
back to El Salvador.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.644
It's been two weeks

19:37.677 --> 19:40.046
and the smell hasn't exactly
gotten worse,

19:40.079 --> 19:42.915
it's just changed.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.285
I'll let you get started.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.560
- By Jove.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.828
- * I don't even have to try *

19:55.862 --> 19:58.265
* When I'm with you *

19:58.298 --> 20:00.367
* All the stupid things I say *

20:00.400 --> 20:04.271
* You know they're true *

20:04.304 --> 20:05.905
* Everyone else *

20:05.938 --> 20:08.441
* Seems so crazy *

20:08.475 --> 20:09.742
* I don't believe *

20:09.776 --> 20:11.911
* I could ever be *

20:11.944 --> 20:13.946
* Without you *

20:16.416 --> 20:18.418
* Without you *

20:20.953 --> 20:22.955
* Without you *

20:25.224 --> 20:26.593
* Without you *

20:32.599 --> 20:34.601
