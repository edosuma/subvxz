00:00.016 --> 00:03.287
- Previously on Wynonna Earp
- A kid is missing.

00:03.312 --> 00:06.194
- I'm retiring.
- To Sheriff Nicole Haught!

00:06.219 --> 00:08.233
Charlie.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.547
This you flirting?

00:09.572 --> 00:11.813
My baby daddy is married to a vampire.

00:11.838 --> 00:13.008
I don't like you at all.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.891
- Are you sure?
- Stop pretending...

00:14.916 --> 00:17.694
that this isn't what you came here for.

00:17.719 --> 00:20.555
He was kind, honest.
His name was Julian.

00:20.580 --> 00:23.200
- My dad was an angel.
- You were born out of love.

00:23.225 --> 00:26.486
- We can find Julian if you want.
- What's in it for me?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:35.015 --> 00:39.038
Okay, this is the last
time we're doing this.

00:39.063 --> 00:41.959
Since we both have such
stressful jobs and everything,

00:41.984 --> 00:44.484
we could keep doing this
to take the edge off.

00:44.509 --> 00:45.509
No.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.750
I'm all edge, Charlie. If
you can't handle that...

00:53.807 --> 00:56.648
You may handle me however you please.

00:57.856 --> 01:01.946
Good morning, guys. I'm Deputy
Nicole Haught and I am here...

01:01.971 --> 01:03.781
- Shitty-shit-shit!
- Whoa, whoa.

01:03.806 --> 01:05.441
I thought that was going pretty good.

01:05.477 --> 01:07.328
How's Purgatory's finest this morning?

01:07.353 --> 01:08.054
Here we go.

01:08.079 --> 01:10.534
Thank you, sincerely,
for all that you do.

01:10.559 --> 01:12.140
I know it's not an easy job.

01:12.165 --> 01:14.784
Nedley calls us hose jockeys.

01:14.809 --> 01:19.164
Sheriff Nedley's sense of
humour leaves a lot to be desired.

01:19.497 --> 01:22.199
And rest assured, when I am Sheriff,

01:22.224 --> 01:25.093
you will be both
respected and supported.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.630
I will also pre-order a
dozen of your calendars.

01:28.286 --> 01:30.340
I'm April this year.

01:31.153 --> 01:32.656
Happy Easter to me.

01:32.681 --> 01:35.914
I had no idea Officer Haught was your
sister's girlfriend. That's so weird.

01:36.175 --> 01:37.882
You're not one of those "Adam and Eve",

01:37.907 --> 01:39.578
"not Adam and Steve" people, are you?

01:39.603 --> 01:42.602
God, no. Purgatory Pride's my
favourite event of the year.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.289
Purgatory has a Pride?

01:44.314 --> 01:47.692
Yeah. We painted the
fire-engine rainbow.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.575
Nicole warned me about you.

01:50.948 --> 01:53.676
- That I'm super flexible?
- No, that you're a hot mess.

01:53.701 --> 01:56.701
Well, it's better than a cold... tidy.

02:01.250 --> 02:02.876
This was fun.

02:03.241 --> 02:04.841
Thanks for the...

02:05.724 --> 02:08.098
- Pump?
- That's gross.

02:08.122 --> 02:10.959
- Backdraft?
- Did we do that?

02:10.984 --> 02:12.425
Heat?

02:13.929 --> 02:17.052
Nah.

02:18.730 --> 02:20.516
Was that me?

02:27.908 --> 02:29.567
Nothing to see here.

02:29.592 --> 02:33.792
Just an adult woman with adult-woman
needs leaving... a fire hall.

02:33.817 --> 02:37.420
- Let me guess You need a ride.
- I had a ride. I need a nap.

02:37.523 --> 02:39.057
And a... ride.

02:39.127 --> 02:42.048
So you and Doc, not a thing anymore?

02:42.073 --> 02:44.007
We were never a thing.

02:44.032 --> 02:46.041
And I haven't seen him for a week.

02:55.069 --> 02:57.428
Burns like a mother!

03:11.276 --> 03:12.910
What have I done?

03:13.556 --> 03:16.057
Bulshar's ring is rejecting you,

03:16.082 --> 03:19.325
now that you're compromised.

03:19.985 --> 03:22.078
Don't worry, my love.

03:22.103 --> 03:24.747
Now we're linked together forever.

03:24.946 --> 03:27.083
Just like you wanted.

03:31.370 --> 03:33.756
Just like I wanted.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.024
What's with the children's choir?

04:03.049 --> 04:06.124
It's a bunch of Omicron Tau Psis
slumming it from the big city.

04:06.149 --> 04:08.039
We confiscated their
party bus this morning.

04:08.064 --> 04:11.585
- Who party-buses at 10 a.m.?
- The deeply committed.

04:12.593 --> 04:15.774
Drink up, friends.
Drink up, brothers.

04:15.799 --> 04:19.302
Drink up, all you sexy... mothers.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.422
- Maybe later.
- Sorry, I...

04:21.841 --> 04:23.409
I dozed off.

04:23.434 --> 04:25.803
- What's all this?
- Since closing down the abattoir,

04:25.828 --> 04:28.812
thereby rescuing my tall-n'-jazzy,
maybe-kinda boyfriend,

04:28.837 --> 04:31.517
I've been trying to figure out where
Bulshar could've moved his operation.

04:31.541 --> 04:32.908
Nice!

04:32.933 --> 04:35.391
Also, when was the last
time you went home?

04:35.416 --> 04:36.516
Or ate?

04:36.541 --> 04:39.298
That depends. What day is it?

04:39.323 --> 04:41.016
We're gonna need to get you a falafel.

04:41.041 --> 04:44.055
- Push with your legs!
- Shut up with your mouth.

04:44.292 --> 04:46.293
Am I finally gonna see your sex cave?

04:46.747 --> 04:48.712
It's more of a closet.

04:49.031 --> 04:51.099
Retired Nedley is kinky.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.712
Everything in there I seized from
crime scenes that didn't feel kosher.

04:54.819 --> 04:56.891
Ones with supernatural element.

04:56.916 --> 04:58.565
Why didn't you turn them over to Dolls?

04:58.590 --> 05:02.970
Well, initially, I wasn't sure
I could trust him. Now I know.

05:06.461 --> 05:09.184
Whoa.

05:09.473 --> 05:12.205
How long have you been
hiding this stuff?

05:12.230 --> 05:14.165
Since I became Sheriff.

05:14.373 --> 05:16.908
We're gonna find dinosaur bones.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.110
Ha-ha.

05:18.135 --> 05:20.601
It's up to you two to decide
what to keep, what to burn.

05:20.626 --> 05:24.362
It's like Hoarders meets Storage
Wars. And I, for one, am here for it.

05:24.421 --> 05:26.947
How you making out with getting
city council's stamp of approval?

05:26.971 --> 05:28.866
Well, Bunny Loblaw
won't return my calls.

05:28.891 --> 05:30.888
That stuck-up Tuesday's still around?

05:30.913 --> 05:35.126
Yep. And reigning over city
council with an iron fistula.

05:35.194 --> 05:37.897
Bunny Loblaw's the real
king-maker here in Purgatory.

05:37.922 --> 05:40.803
And she won't return your
calls because she's a bully.

05:40.828 --> 05:43.096
Bullies smell fear, they
just get more vicious.

05:43.335 --> 05:45.470
Yeah, dummy, everyone knows that.

05:45.495 --> 05:47.960
You get her on your own turf,
you look her dead in the eye

05:47.985 --> 05:49.883
and you tell her that you're
the only person for the job.

05:49.907 --> 05:55.702
You're right. I am going to call her
and I'm gonna set up a meeting.

05:55.727 --> 05:57.995
Bunny's gonna eat her for lunch.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.570
- Nedley, are you looking at my ass?
- No.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.468
This'll have to do.

06:10.262 --> 06:12.197
You shouldn't sneak around

06:12.319 --> 06:16.044
when there's a gun-toting
mental patient on the loose.

06:16.218 --> 06:19.087
Well, I thought we were friends.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.467
You bailed right in the
middle of my Christmas feast.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.471
You find my Brussels sprouts offensive?

06:28.375 --> 06:32.845
I do apologize, ma'am, but...
something came up.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.385
You're gonna make it up to me.

06:44.357 --> 06:46.447
I fear this is about to get weird.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.953
Don't worry. I'll drive if you're tired.

06:50.553 --> 06:52.235
I do not understand.

06:52.260 --> 06:53.927
I need to get out of here.

06:54.546 --> 06:56.114
Just for a little while.

06:56.139 --> 06:58.814
- Cabin fever.
- You don't know the half of it.

06:58.839 --> 07:00.940
I just might.

07:01.882 --> 07:04.791
Okay... let's go,

07:04.816 --> 07:06.619
before I roll you for the keys.

07:08.704 --> 07:12.340
What do you think about this?

07:13.770 --> 07:16.853
- Urn. Nice.
- Okay.

07:16.878 --> 07:19.579
But is it supernatural?

07:19.604 --> 07:21.393
Supernaturally oogly.

07:21.418 --> 07:22.971
Can you check this out? I...

07:22.996 --> 07:24.530
I found Nedley's old police memo.

07:24.555 --> 07:28.221
"November 9, 1996. Raccoon
stuck in drop ceiling."

07:28.246 --> 07:31.849
"Call cleared, but now
require rabies shot."

07:31.874 --> 07:35.351
Wynonna, can you, like, a
little help here, please?

07:35.376 --> 07:39.679
My God, never... Holy shit!
Baby Nedley.

07:39.704 --> 07:42.140
When you're done with story time,
can you do some actual work?

07:42.164 --> 07:43.811
Nicole, you're a smart-ish girl.

07:43.836 --> 07:46.000
Surely you've figured out
by now that this whole

07:46.025 --> 07:47.930
"cleaning out the secret
locker" job is bullshit.

07:47.954 --> 07:50.155
Nedley made it up to make us
practice working together.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.741
- He Parent Trapped us.
- None of this stuff matters.

07:52.766 --> 07:55.391
And it sure as hell isn't gonna
help us with our Bulshar problem.

07:55.416 --> 07:58.274
Alright, well, you might be fine
to sit on your ass and do nothing,

07:58.299 --> 07:59.265
but I'm not.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.774
Especially after what he did to Dolls.

08:03.770 --> 08:05.258
You want my help?

08:05.283 --> 08:06.742
- Yes.
- Fine, Nicole.

08:06.767 --> 08:08.961
- Thank you.
- No problem.

08:08.986 --> 08:10.742
Crap.

08:12.276 --> 08:14.856
Crap.

08:14.881 --> 08:17.773
Definitely crap. Not crap.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.132
- More crap!
- Wynonna, you're being reckless!

08:20.157 --> 08:21.492
- Super crap.
- Whoa!

08:21.517 --> 08:23.867
You know what, Deputy Dipshit,
that's kinda my brand,

08:23.892 --> 08:25.706
and it's been working fine so far.

08:25.731 --> 08:29.101
God, I am so sick of your attitude!

08:30.948 --> 08:35.974
Smooth move, Ginger Spice. You just
earned yourself seven years' bad luck.

09:00.584 --> 09:02.180
Hey, Tayla, you seen Doc around lately?

09:02.205 --> 09:02.763
No.

09:02.797 --> 09:05.578
I'll have a whiskey. Leave the bottle.

09:07.929 --> 09:10.256
Whatcha got there, Sheriff?

09:10.281 --> 09:12.820
Ginger ale. And it's just Randy now.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.640
Didn't peg you for a
teetotaller, Just Randy.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.208
Well, I'm still on duty.

09:18.361 --> 09:21.492
Those drunken frat boys from the big
city got me running my ass off.

09:21.517 --> 09:24.653
One of the many, many jobs I
won't miss when I retire.

09:24.678 --> 09:27.046
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

09:31.651 --> 09:34.286
Look what I found for your
retirement party slideshow.

09:38.939 --> 09:41.674
It's like your top lip
is wearing a skinny tie.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.444
How's it going in the evidence locker?

09:47.121 --> 09:50.081
Nicole smashed some stuff. Big surprise.

09:50.106 --> 09:52.875
Must hard to move around with
a giant pickle up your ass.

09:52.900 --> 09:57.003
- Give her some slack, Wynonna.
- You know me. I love slack.

09:57.028 --> 09:59.565
That chick is all work and no play.
Next thing you know,

09:59.590 --> 10:03.831
she's gonna be chopping people up with
an axe like... that dude in the hotel.

10:03.856 --> 10:05.590
Dave at the Motor Inn?

10:06.460 --> 10:09.706
- Him, too.
- Well, go easy on Nicole.

10:11.863 --> 10:14.906
You two have more in
common than you think.

10:23.282 --> 10:25.292
Well, it's worth a shot.

10:25.636 --> 10:28.376
I guess. Okay.

10:31.704 --> 10:33.271
Hi! Bunny.

10:33.339 --> 10:34.840
Come on in.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.136
- I did.
- Can I take your c-coat?

10:37.243 --> 10:40.224
Why? So you can rifle
through the pockets?

10:41.430 --> 10:44.666
What on God's flat earth is that?

10:44.691 --> 10:47.821
That's just Calamity Jane. Please
don't worry. She's super friendly.

10:47.846 --> 10:50.790
I-I don't care what it is.
Either she goes or I go.

10:50.815 --> 10:53.216
I am deathly allergic!

10:53.241 --> 10:54.821
Right. Okay.

10:56.047 --> 10:57.899
Okay. Come on, girlie.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.774
Calamity, you're getting fat.

11:00.635 --> 11:05.314
Okay, just make yourself cozy.
One sec. I'll be right back.

11:16.594 --> 11:18.595
Disgusting.

11:26.232 --> 11:27.875
I am sorry, ma'am.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.492
Willa would've been
very sorry about Willa.

11:30.517 --> 11:32.250
That was always her first thought.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.492
Willa was Ward's... pet.

11:34.517 --> 11:37.961
God, she was... spoiled and
she had a mean streak.

11:38.055 --> 11:40.601
She'd have been a terrible heir.

11:42.349 --> 11:44.350
She was just a child.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.664
Yeah, she was my baby.

11:46.689 --> 11:49.460
I'm so sorry I wasn't
there to protect you.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.891
- Hey, where you going now?
- Come on.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.617
I'll tell you which way to turn.

11:56.642 --> 11:58.922
Ms. Gibson. Michelle!
It's freezing out here.

11:58.947 --> 12:01.335
Stop being a wiener. Come on.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.125
Besides, I know you got
a bottle of tequila

12:03.150 --> 12:05.861
stashed under your seat, and
that's gonna get us through.

12:05.886 --> 12:09.855
So I have some great ideas on
how to make the town safer

12:09.880 --> 12:11.828
and the department run more efficiently.

12:11.853 --> 12:14.355
Well, that's all well and
good, Deputy Haught,

12:14.380 --> 12:16.314
but my main concern is this.

12:16.339 --> 12:18.373
Randy Nedley is full of shit.

12:18.398 --> 12:20.828
- Excuse me?
- I am so sick and tired

12:20.853 --> 12:22.400
of being kept in the dark

12:22.425 --> 12:25.367
about all the strange
occurrences in Purgatory.

12:25.392 --> 12:29.095
I won't be lied to about what's
really going on in my town,

12:29.120 --> 12:30.353
under my nose.

12:31.762 --> 12:34.297
- Which is what exactly?
- Well, you tell me.

12:34.322 --> 12:37.257
That's why I'm here. Unless
you don't want to be sheriff.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.172
And don't give me that hooey

12:39.197 --> 12:44.501
about costume parties gone
awry or zoo animals escaping.

12:44.609 --> 12:49.468
Well, Bunny, um, Purgatory,
it's a very unique... town

12:49.493 --> 12:52.235
with... unique challenges.

12:52.260 --> 12:55.336
Sorry to interrupt. Just need to talk
to Deputy Tater Haught for a sec.

12:55.361 --> 12:57.141
Wynonna, this is really not a good time.

12:57.166 --> 12:58.735
Actually, it's perfect timing.

12:58.760 --> 13:02.198
Because I'm thinking of
backing Wynonna for Sheriff.

13:02.595 --> 13:05.618
You can't be serious.

13:05.643 --> 13:07.444
I'm dead serious.

13:07.469 --> 13:10.287
Wynonna, you are a straight-shooter.

13:10.312 --> 13:12.880
- You're one tough bitch.
- Hey-o.

13:12.905 --> 13:16.321
And the Earps are one of
Purgatory's original families.

13:16.702 --> 13:18.298
This one...

13:18.323 --> 13:20.923
- This one?
- Sorry, what about "this one"?

13:20.948 --> 13:24.417
What Purgatory needs
is a homegrown hero,

13:24.442 --> 13:27.644
not some fly-by-night outsider,

13:27.669 --> 13:30.737
who, let's face it, is a little too...

13:32.109 --> 13:33.743
different.

13:34.620 --> 13:38.532
- Can I just... real quick, for a sec?
- One sec. We'll just...

13:38.557 --> 13:40.313
in the kitchen.

13:40.338 --> 13:44.142
Wait until Bunny finds out
about Purgatory Pride.

13:44.167 --> 13:46.798
- What are you doing here?!
- Right!

13:46.823 --> 13:49.196
- It's about Nedley and you...
- And me...

13:49.221 --> 13:53.118
Did Buns Buns really
just say I could be...?

13:53.143 --> 13:55.329
No, you cannot take that job.

13:55.354 --> 13:58.017
- I don't want that job.
- Yeah, 'cause you would be a disaster.

13:58.042 --> 14:01.249
- No shit, Not Sheriff.
- You have no police training,

14:01.274 --> 14:04.205
you're terrible with authority, you're
not even qualified to run a Chipotle!

14:04.229 --> 14:06.664
Guac-a-cuse me? You know what?

14:06.689 --> 14:10.094
Maybe I'd like to be Sheriff Nedley 2.0.

14:10.119 --> 14:12.805
I'm your boss after all.

14:12.830 --> 14:15.789
Well, excuse me, but you can't even
do one single assignment properly

14:15.814 --> 14:16.798
without breaking a gazillion rules

14:16.823 --> 14:19.142
and a creepy-ass mirror in the process!

14:19.167 --> 14:22.914
God, ISIS!

14:22.939 --> 14:24.454
What rules?!

14:24.479 --> 14:27.658
Purgatory is the goddamn Thunderdome
and I'm Tina friggin' Turner!

14:27.683 --> 14:29.735
- What are you talking about?!
- Point is,

14:29.760 --> 14:31.938
you can wrap yourself up
in the rules like a...

14:31.963 --> 14:34.110
snug little blanket to
keep you warm at night,

14:34.135 --> 14:36.291
but I'm gonna go get shit done.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.500
Balls! Bunny's dead.

14:42.213 --> 14:43.454
Calamity Jane! She's allergic!

14:43.479 --> 14:44.704
Yeah.

14:45.349 --> 14:46.642
Bunny? Hey.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.213
I know a dozen places
we can hide the body.

14:48.237 --> 14:50.830
She's still alive.

14:50.855 --> 14:52.252
Fine, I'll save them for next time.

14:52.276 --> 14:53.649
Her purse. Wynonna, get her purse!

14:53.674 --> 14:57.532
- Yeah, cash.
- No! Medication, Wynonna!

14:57.940 --> 14:59.874
Crap.

15:01.725 --> 15:04.823
Is this Oxy?!

15:04.848 --> 15:07.009
The tea.

15:08.501 --> 15:12.023
Alright, Bunny, here we go, here we go.
Swallow.

15:12.048 --> 15:15.084
C'mon, c'mon, you old bat!

15:15.109 --> 15:17.834
Okay.

15:18.629 --> 15:22.031
- I don't need a doctor!
- How about an exorcist, Bun Bun?

15:22.056 --> 15:23.922
Okay, let's put her in my cruiser.
We'll get her faster

15:23.946 --> 15:25.595
to the hospital with the
lights and sirens on.

15:25.619 --> 15:27.558
Don't take me to Purgatory General!

15:27.583 --> 15:29.110
They have too many immigrant doctors!

15:29.135 --> 15:31.569
- Okay, that's enough out of you.
- Jeez!

15:31.594 --> 15:35.142
- Go inside, get her purse.
- So you do wanna rob her?

15:35.167 --> 15:36.962
No, I want to get her meds. The
doctors need them to diagnose her.

15:36.986 --> 15:37.892
Go, go, go!

15:37.917 --> 15:39.041
Get her to the hospital
and get the meds after.

15:39.065 --> 15:39.875
What the hell?!

15:39.900 --> 15:41.361
I will get them. You want
something done right!

15:41.385 --> 15:44.100
No, I will do it.

15:44.125 --> 15:48.243
What is going on?!

15:52.906 --> 15:56.082
You have gotta be freakin' kidding me!

15:56.625 --> 16:00.585
Look who needs my help now.

16:02.272 --> 16:04.372
- What are you doing?
- Get in.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.114
Dude, I have her keys.
What about your truck?

16:07.139 --> 16:09.295
Battery's dead. I blame
your cat for that, too.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.193
Okay, well, I should drive,

16:10.218 --> 16:11.989
because then we're not
stealing Bunny's car,

16:12.014 --> 16:13.582
we're just commandeering
it for official police...

16:13.606 --> 16:16.142
- Bigger fish, Nicole.
- Okay.

16:16.638 --> 16:18.978
Okay, great, I'll call Waverly.

16:19.003 --> 16:20.370
- We're logging on now.
- Hurry.

16:20.426 --> 16:22.360
We need to make sure Bunny's okay.

16:22.385 --> 16:25.763
Sorry, sorry, but it's...
it's kind of funny.

16:25.788 --> 16:27.665
You guys have some terrible luck today.

16:27.690 --> 16:29.679
Like "black fly in your
Chardonnay" kind of terrible.

16:29.703 --> 16:31.867
Speed it up, Jagged Little Nerd.

16:32.674 --> 16:36.420
Okay. Pinging the cruiser's GPS,

16:36.445 --> 16:39.139
and... good news! It's parked.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.779
Bunny Nut Cheerios! You need to hurry.

16:42.804 --> 16:44.357
Later.

16:44.941 --> 16:49.788
Of course those two frat brats
drove your car to a biker bar!

16:49.813 --> 16:50.725
Yeah, well,

16:50.750 --> 16:53.210
maybe they're friendly bikers hosting
a Golden Girls Trivia Night.

16:53.234 --> 16:55.725
Well, Rose, we are not in St.
Olaf anymore.

16:55.750 --> 16:58.428
Get me outta here, you
white-trash tart!!

16:58.453 --> 17:00.834
You're feeling better. Try your handle.

17:00.859 --> 17:01.881
I am!!

17:01.906 --> 17:03.301
It doesn't open from the inside.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.993
It's a safety feature. Haven't you
been arrested, like, 500 times?!

17:06.019 --> 17:09.318
- Not the time, Nicole!
- Luckily, I always have a spare key.

17:09.343 --> 17:11.111
Good.

17:12.588 --> 17:16.920
You are some kind of moron, Haught!

17:16.944 --> 17:19.579
Whoa! Bullet could
ricochet and hit Bunny.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.940
- I'm willing to take the risk.
- Or us.

17:22.435 --> 17:23.435
Okay.

17:23.461 --> 17:25.231
Why don't we just call
the fire department?

17:25.256 --> 17:26.304
- They can pop the door off.
- No!!

17:26.328 --> 17:27.748
- What?
- Do not do that.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.398
They'll never let us
sheriffs live it down.

17:29.422 --> 17:30.767
Okay, you got a better idea?

17:31.107 --> 17:33.889
Yeah. We go in and find
Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Douche,

17:33.914 --> 17:35.631
we're in and out five minutes, tops.

17:35.656 --> 17:38.732
If we get the keys, she'll never
notice, we're good to go. Let's go.

17:38.757 --> 17:42.240
Don't leave me in here,
you sonsofbitches!!

17:42.265 --> 17:44.584
You are gonna hear from my lawyer!!

17:45.240 --> 17:47.811
Peacemaker?

17:47.836 --> 17:49.335
We're outnumbered.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.238
We don't want Bunny to think
we went in guns blazing.

17:55.962 --> 18:01.767
I couldn't wait to join the rodeo
circuit and flee this shithole town.

18:01.792 --> 18:04.061
Then I came back one...

18:04.086 --> 18:07.850
long August weekend and
I got drunk, pregnant.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.977
Ended up marrying Ward Earp.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.842
Well, he did give you three
beautiful daughters.

18:12.867 --> 18:16.603
No, he gave me two. Waverly
was Julian's, remember?

18:19.487 --> 18:21.537
What's it like, being with an angel?

18:21.562 --> 18:23.563
What's it like being with a demon?

18:29.074 --> 18:31.022
No, Julian made me feel like

18:31.047 --> 18:34.180
I didn't have to break
my spirit to be happy.

18:35.850 --> 18:38.082
I do know what that is like.

18:38.107 --> 18:40.350
The night Waverly was born...

18:41.253 --> 18:45.123
Ward pushed Julian outside
of the Ghost River Triangle.

18:46.243 --> 18:48.217
It happened right here.

18:48.242 --> 18:50.677
He's been lost ever since.

18:50.702 --> 18:52.236
How do you know that?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.570
Bobo told me.

18:56.595 --> 18:59.064
Del Rey? You talked to him?

18:59.209 --> 19:01.809
I did more than talk to him.

19:01.834 --> 19:04.790
I gave him the Christmas
dinner that you didn't want.

19:04.815 --> 19:06.449
And his freedom.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.673
Are you out of your
godforsaken mind, woman?

19:10.698 --> 19:13.556
I think we've established,
yes, sometimes.

19:13.581 --> 19:17.868
- You have unleashed a monster.
- Bulshar has risen, sweet cheeks.

19:17.893 --> 19:19.560
These are end times.

19:19.585 --> 19:22.610
It's gonna take monsters
to fight a monster.

19:22.635 --> 19:27.189
Bobo Del Rey has tried to kill
your daughters multiple times.

19:27.214 --> 19:29.082
Nobody's perfect.

19:29.107 --> 19:32.509
You do not get to make those
life-or-death decisions for them!

19:32.534 --> 19:34.568
Who's gonna stop me?

19:34.593 --> 19:36.572
You, Johnny Hank?

19:36.597 --> 19:39.227
If necessary.

19:39.252 --> 19:40.697
Well, good.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.720
Seems like now we're finally talking.

19:42.745 --> 19:46.173
- So here's my terms.
- Yeah!!!

19:46.198 --> 19:49.307
What should we do with
these interlopers?

19:49.332 --> 19:52.486
Release them to the woods and
hunt them down like dogs?

19:52.511 --> 19:55.150
- Yeah!!
- Or, or...

19:55.175 --> 19:59.445
we could eviscerate them
right here on the bar.

20:00.972 --> 20:03.474
Are you gonna stay late
and clean up that mess?

20:03.499 --> 20:06.167
'Cause I'm not. Suggestions?

20:06.192 --> 20:08.960
Anyone else?

20:10.854 --> 20:13.589
Yah-ha. That might be a good idea.

20:13.614 --> 20:15.346
Shhh-shhh.

20:15.371 --> 20:17.973
Well, well, well.

20:17.998 --> 20:20.251
Looks like today is our lucky day.

20:20.276 --> 20:23.008
Seems the would-be sheriff and the heir

20:23.033 --> 20:25.338
have decided to join
us for a little drink.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.986
We were dumb to think we could
pull a fast one on you.

20:29.011 --> 20:31.446
But I can tell you're men of sport.

20:31.471 --> 20:35.882
And, you know, where's the sport in
ripping Dumb and Doucher to shreds?

20:35.907 --> 20:37.696
What are you proposin'?

20:38.320 --> 20:41.202
I'm proposing that you let them go,

20:41.227 --> 20:42.359
and...

20:42.384 --> 20:46.921
you and me and, Deputy
Haught to Trot here

20:46.946 --> 20:48.890
have ourselves a little contest.

20:49.309 --> 20:51.010
What are you good at?

20:51.195 --> 20:53.046
- Golden Girls Trivia.
- Drinking.

20:53.071 --> 20:56.241
You really wanna challenge
me to a drinking contest?

20:56.266 --> 20:58.167
I do.

20:58.192 --> 21:01.069
And... if we win, then you let us go.

21:01.094 --> 21:05.725
- What happens when I win?
- Then you...

21:05.750 --> 21:08.038
get to... kill us.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.750
You could've just offered them cash.

21:10.775 --> 21:13.927
I didn't work it out all the way
to the end before I pitched it.

21:13.952 --> 21:16.788
You must be the stupidest heir yet.

21:16.813 --> 21:18.663
Definitely in the top five.

21:18.688 --> 21:20.972
Okay.

21:20.997 --> 21:22.945
Let them Greeks go.

21:23.514 --> 21:25.679
You owe us. Take the
cruiser and the old bag

21:25.704 --> 21:27.608
in the backseat and get
to the hospital, okay?

21:27.633 --> 21:31.169
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now... let's get pissed!

21:31.194 --> 21:34.140
Yeah!

21:34.788 --> 21:36.897
I'm worried. Neither
of them are answering.

21:36.922 --> 21:39.157
Okay, wait, wait. Let's just recap.

21:39.182 --> 21:42.498
First, Bunny has a heart
attack at Nicole's.

21:42.523 --> 21:43.195
Yes.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.225
Then the cruiser gets
stolen with Bunny in it.

21:45.252 --> 21:48.523
Then it just happens to end
up at a Revenant roadhouse?

21:48.548 --> 21:51.854
Doesn't that sound
spectacularly unlucky to you?

21:53.612 --> 21:56.757
Too unlucky to be a coincidence?

21:58.078 --> 22:00.843
Mirror, mirror, on the floor...

22:05.959 --> 22:09.763
Maybe if we put it back together,
their luck will change?

22:09.788 --> 22:11.421
Well, it can't get any worse.

22:11.446 --> 22:13.522
- Okay.
- One...

22:13.547 --> 22:16.882
two, three, drink.

22:20.633 --> 22:23.210
Is that all you got?

22:23.235 --> 22:26.371
Come on, fella, let's take this
up a notch? Grab the ouzo.

22:26.396 --> 22:28.331
I really wish you would stop helping.

22:28.356 --> 22:32.561
One, two, three, drink!

22:37.507 --> 22:39.716
How you feeling there, Rolfy boy?

22:39.741 --> 22:41.320
- I feel good.
- Good.

22:41.345 --> 22:42.929
I feel strong.

22:42.954 --> 22:44.288
I failed college.

22:44.313 --> 22:48.382
How are you not bombed? You
weigh, like, eight pounds.

22:48.407 --> 22:51.241
I like you. Ena,

22:51.266 --> 22:54.179
dio, tria!

23:02.383 --> 23:05.851
What's wrong?

23:06.502 --> 23:09.427
Game over, lightweight!

23:09.452 --> 23:11.147
What? I swallowed it!

23:11.172 --> 23:13.825
And it came back up, which means
you lose. Everybody knows that.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.468
It's true, man. Everyone knows that.

23:17.257 --> 23:21.273
Well, we won fair and square. Uncuff us.

23:21.298 --> 23:24.140
Hang on!

23:25.406 --> 23:28.350
You've been spitting your
shots into this bottle.

23:28.375 --> 23:31.685
No, she hasn't. You haven't, right?

23:31.710 --> 23:34.429
- I learned it from Coyote Ugly.
- I love that movie!

23:34.454 --> 23:35.854
You broke the rules.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.132
Now I get to break your necks.

23:38.157 --> 23:40.765
Ooh, good one.

23:40.790 --> 23:43.147
Stop!!

23:43.172 --> 23:44.639
- Stop quipping and run!
- Yep.

23:44.664 --> 23:47.374
Okay!

23:51.831 --> 23:53.765
Hurry up! The cuff's chafing.

23:53.790 --> 23:56.468
You're going too fast and I'm too drunk.

23:57.268 --> 23:59.983
- You are literally the worst!
- Climb!

24:00.008 --> 24:02.663
Climb! Climb!

24:09.044 --> 24:11.312
You found my mementos.

24:11.762 --> 24:15.208
You mean the souvenirs of all
the people you have killed?

24:15.233 --> 24:17.853
- That's a vulgar way to put it.
- It is the truth.

24:18.184 --> 24:20.334
Is it Wynonna you're helping?

24:21.306 --> 24:23.640
In a manner of speaking.

24:23.856 --> 24:25.323
She must be some woman

24:25.348 --> 24:28.432
if you're willing to give up
one of your precious pistols.

24:28.963 --> 24:31.220
It's sweet you think she'd want you now.

24:32.081 --> 24:34.850
You know how your jealousy bores me.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.213
As you really are.

24:36.238 --> 24:38.385
Wynonna helped make me as I am.

24:40.637 --> 24:43.606
I did! Because you asked me to!

24:46.603 --> 24:48.304
My Henry.

24:49.344 --> 24:52.182
The greatest gunslinger that ever lived.

24:52.524 --> 24:55.126
A filthy, rotten scoundrel.

24:56.176 --> 24:59.345
All this helping and sacrificing
she has you doing...

24:59.370 --> 25:02.506
- She thinks I can be better.
- Than what?

25:02.843 --> 25:04.477
It's beneath you.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.413
Wynonna is breaking your spirit.

25:07.481 --> 25:11.550
But I love you when
you're at your worst.

25:12.534 --> 25:13.968
Maybe even more.

25:19.287 --> 25:20.988
Then you'll know...

25:21.013 --> 25:23.281
I'm not a man that does ultimatums.

25:23.306 --> 25:24.907
Or likes to choose.

25:24.932 --> 25:27.276
You have chosen.

25:27.645 --> 25:30.742
And you're mine, forever now.

25:30.767 --> 25:34.136
So go, tell the Earp heir.

25:34.823 --> 25:38.325
See if she welcomes you
back into her bed.

25:43.899 --> 25:47.561
We wouldn't be in this mess if
you just played by the rules!

25:47.586 --> 25:50.264
There are no rules in
this shit-town, Nicole!

25:50.289 --> 25:52.867
If you wanna be all normal and
law-abiding, do it somewhere else!

25:52.892 --> 25:55.140
You know what? Get your ass
out of your head, Wynonna!

25:55.165 --> 25:56.704
You're not the only one
who's been through stuff.

25:56.728 --> 26:00.890
Right, I forgot. You
survived a massacre.

26:00.915 --> 26:04.867
- Yeah, that one is legit as F.
- You're right I did.

26:04.892 --> 26:08.265
Ans so I'm not about to die
here handcuffed to a criminal!

26:08.290 --> 26:09.429
You, by the way.

26:09.454 --> 26:11.489
Real mature!

26:11.514 --> 26:14.537
You know what? You survived some shit,

26:14.562 --> 26:16.547
and I cannot wait for your TED Talk,

26:16.572 --> 26:18.945
but get back to me when you're cursed!

26:18.970 --> 26:20.742
Jesus!

26:20.767 --> 26:23.135
- Mother bad-lucker, it's jammed.
- Argh!

26:23.160 --> 26:25.476
Not even like Space or strawberry,

26:25.501 --> 26:27.461
but the bad kind of jam!

26:30.983 --> 26:36.256
Well, aren't you two a pair
of catty little bitches?

26:36.281 --> 26:37.421
I like it.

26:37.446 --> 26:40.273
All that animosity running
through your veins...

26:40.298 --> 26:42.703
You're basting in it.

26:42.728 --> 26:45.856
It'll make you taste so much better.

26:48.175 --> 26:51.041
- You be Scott.
- You be Tessa.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.813
- We make a pretty good team.
- Yeah, our chemistry's solid.

27:09.106 --> 27:09.798
Okay.

27:09.823 --> 27:12.831
Yep.

27:18.893 --> 27:22.040
As much as I love a feel-good
ending, this ain't it.

27:22.065 --> 27:23.338
Any last words?

27:23.363 --> 27:25.864
- I miss Macaulay Culkin!
- Tell Waverly I love her!

27:25.889 --> 27:29.253
Sure, make me look like an asshole.

27:35.121 --> 27:38.323
You owe me a wife.

27:38.348 --> 27:40.651
- Is this better, or worse?
- Worse.

27:40.676 --> 27:42.604
Okay.

27:44.044 --> 27:46.251
There's... there's gotta
be one more piece!

27:46.276 --> 27:48.933
Whoop, there it is! Here, here.

27:48.958 --> 27:51.284
- My God.
- Okay, bad luck over?

27:51.309 --> 27:54.331
- We fixed it! Did we fix it?
- I dunno.

27:55.724 --> 27:58.253
- There's a mountain man!!
- A gross, scabby mountain man!!

27:58.278 --> 27:59.995
So not fixed, then.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.737
Not so fast, Gandalf!

28:02.762 --> 28:04.362
No!

28:04.387 --> 28:08.471
You shall not pass!!!

28:12.481 --> 28:15.698
Yeah, on second thought,
you do you, man...

28:18.372 --> 28:21.999
One of you will be my new wife!

28:22.024 --> 28:24.253
- Not it.
- Did he just say wife?

28:24.278 --> 28:26.046
Come on.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.769
Help.

28:31.220 --> 28:33.315
Shit!

28:35.794 --> 28:39.163
Okay, the mirror wasn't the
only thing they broke, right?

28:39.188 --> 28:41.440
- Wait. What's this?
- Is that ceramic?

28:41.465 --> 28:44.909
It looks like a... a lawn ornament?

28:45.976 --> 28:47.543
He's not an ogre.

28:47.568 --> 28:49.159
He's a gnome!

28:49.184 --> 28:54.165
- How does that help us?!
- You owe me a wife. Now choose.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.829
- How could we possibly...
- She'd make a great gnome wife.

28:56.854 --> 29:00.370
- Ooh, loving a good puzzle.
- She's beautiful and...

29:00.395 --> 29:02.870
annoyingly noble. And I
know she's great in bed,

29:02.902 --> 29:04.923
because my house has very thin walls.

29:04.948 --> 29:06.440
- Quick, quick, quick, quick!
- Stop!

29:06.465 --> 29:07.857
You should choose Wynonna.

29:07.882 --> 29:10.884
She is funny and irrepressible,

29:10.909 --> 29:13.979
and she always goes to the mat
for the people she loves.

29:14.004 --> 29:14.792
More tape!

29:14.817 --> 29:17.259
And she's super fertile!
It was one time.

29:17.284 --> 29:19.972
You stick to that, I will do tape.

29:19.997 --> 29:24.233
I think this would be a really good
time to tell you that I am a lesbian.

29:24.258 --> 29:26.698
Like you never went through
an experimental phase.

29:26.723 --> 29:27.962
Not with gnomes!

29:27.987 --> 29:30.409
That's very narrow-minded, Nicole!
Love is love!

29:30.434 --> 29:32.806
Stop talking!!!

29:34.817 --> 29:37.357
Okay.

29:37.382 --> 29:40.651
You want a wife,
but you need a mint.

29:41.059 --> 29:43.457
- We're missing a piece!
- Okay, I got the knees!

29:43.482 --> 29:45.940
I got the... My God, these are...

29:45.965 --> 29:48.912
Boobs?! Hell gnome, it's a lady!

29:48.937 --> 29:51.440
They broke his gnome wife!
Quick, stick the boobs back on!

29:51.465 --> 29:54.570
- That is a lawsuit waiting to happen!
- Okay, fine, I'll do it!

29:54.595 --> 29:55.862
With the utmost respect, okay?

29:55.887 --> 29:57.554
Just... hand me the double-sided tape!

29:57.579 --> 29:59.838
God, I really wish
we had a gnome bra!

29:59.863 --> 30:01.596
Done!

30:01.621 --> 30:03.253
There.

30:07.829 --> 30:11.222
Monique! You're alright.

30:15.204 --> 30:17.138
Buh-buh-buh-buh!

30:21.458 --> 30:24.493
Aw, that was kind of... Sweet.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.206
And romantic.

30:26.231 --> 30:29.065
Exactly how my first Grindr date ended.

30:30.457 --> 30:32.315
I've said too much.

30:32.340 --> 30:34.292
Found it at the old roadhouse.

30:34.317 --> 30:35.887
Doors were open, keys
were in the ignition.

30:35.911 --> 30:37.815
I wouldn't drive it for more than a day.

30:37.840 --> 30:41.253
You never know when the owner's gonna
sober up and report it stolen.

30:41.278 --> 30:44.739
Okay. We got some cash, an ID.

30:44.764 --> 30:49.473
Ooh, I knew an outlaw'd get what's needed
when I need to get out of Dodge fast.

30:49.632 --> 30:53.448
But... I'm not gonna
take your pistol.

30:53.473 --> 30:55.026
We both know you might need that.

30:55.051 --> 30:56.985
Much obliged.

30:57.010 --> 31:00.120
Otherwise, nicely done, Johnny Hank.

31:00.145 --> 31:02.448
Wish I could say the same.

31:02.601 --> 31:04.542
Is this where you beg me to stay?

31:04.567 --> 31:06.839
I do not beg.

31:08.704 --> 31:11.956
Anyways, this gives us our best
chance at keeping them safe.

31:11.981 --> 31:15.761
Seems to be my lot in life. Leaving
to keep other people safe.

31:15.786 --> 31:17.714
Am I meant to feel sorry for you?

31:17.739 --> 31:18.456
No.

31:18.481 --> 31:20.159
I would never ask you that.

31:20.184 --> 31:23.219
But you do recognize
this, you recognize me,

31:23.244 --> 31:25.127
you recognize what I'm doing.

31:25.152 --> 31:29.206
Setting evil free and imperilling
your own family in the process?

31:29.231 --> 31:32.909
Now that I know what's happened
to Julian, I have to go find him.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.868
He's lost out there.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.828
He's outside the Ghost River Triangle.

31:38.098 --> 31:41.434
From the second I walked
into that barn...

31:41.459 --> 31:44.127
you knew I'd make you leave,

31:44.244 --> 31:46.026
you knew I'd help you.

31:46.051 --> 31:48.846
Sometimes it takes a monster.

31:49.130 --> 31:51.830
Wynonna will be angry.

31:52.558 --> 31:54.872
She's not gonna be angry with you.

31:54.897 --> 31:57.492
She always seems to forgive you.

31:57.517 --> 32:00.643
Still, you may not escape her anger,

32:00.668 --> 32:04.893
for you are abandoning
your family for love.

32:04.918 --> 32:10.078
Like I'm gonna let a
vampire lecture me on love.

32:18.898 --> 32:23.070
Shit.

32:23.843 --> 32:27.086
Out already? Didn't even
have time to send flowers.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.564
It was just a fancy faint.

32:29.589 --> 32:31.977
Yeah, the cat made a
bed in your ass crack.

32:32.002 --> 32:35.273
The doctor said I'm fine.
I'm as healthy as an ox.

32:35.298 --> 32:37.227
- With the cankles to match.
- Listen.

32:37.252 --> 32:40.047
I am just here to tell Officer Haught

32:40.072 --> 32:42.367
that despite the day's events,

32:42.392 --> 32:45.429
she will not be getting my support.

32:46.386 --> 32:49.968
She saved your life, you
incorrigible bitch.

32:49.993 --> 32:51.539
Perhaps.

32:51.740 --> 32:54.929
But she does not belong
here in Purgatory.

32:54.954 --> 32:57.655
She is not our... people.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.421
Are you a xenophobe, or a homophobe?

33:00.446 --> 33:02.070
Why pick just one?

33:02.095 --> 33:04.148
Even though it was against
her best interest,

33:04.173 --> 33:05.249
Nicole did the right thing.

33:05.273 --> 33:07.742
She always does the right
thing, no matter what.

33:07.767 --> 33:09.898
That's the kind of person
who should be sheriff.

33:09.922 --> 33:11.835
- I'll keep that in mind.
- No.

33:12.026 --> 33:13.473
Bunny...

33:13.498 --> 33:16.820
shouldn't we talk about
what really happened today?

33:17.245 --> 33:19.742
What's really got your
pearls all twisted?

33:19.767 --> 33:21.282
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:21.306 --> 33:23.024
What you saw.

33:23.505 --> 33:25.898
Because you saw something,
didn't you, Bun Bun?

33:25.923 --> 33:29.414
It was just a dream, a terrible dream.

33:29.439 --> 33:31.679
Like the one where I'm
on the cruise ship

33:31.704 --> 33:34.883
with all the shirtless...
Portuguese sailors.

33:34.908 --> 33:37.710
Okay, there's a lot to unpack there.

33:37.735 --> 33:40.637
But no... you weren't dreaming.

33:40.662 --> 33:43.062
See, you think you want
to know the things.

33:43.087 --> 33:45.274
Nedley's been keeping secret.

33:45.299 --> 33:48.508
You don't. That monster you saw today,

33:48.533 --> 33:51.902
it's just... the tip of the iceberg.

33:52.124 --> 33:53.273
Iceberg?

33:53.298 --> 33:55.583
If you don't back Nicole for sheriff,

33:55.608 --> 33:59.874
I am sending that monster and
all of his demon friends...

34:00.218 --> 34:01.956
to your house.

34:01.981 --> 34:05.164
You can't and you won't.

34:05.189 --> 34:08.091
Bless your cold, withered heart.

34:08.116 --> 34:10.925
You think it could handle
another "fancy faint"?

34:11.967 --> 34:16.097
Then Nicole Haught's gonna
be the next sheriff. Okay?

34:16.121 --> 34:17.599
Have a lovely day.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.525
I need to get to church.

34:19.550 --> 34:22.645
You gotta book yourself that cruise.

34:28.411 --> 34:30.210
How long have you been listening?

34:30.235 --> 34:32.043
It would've been rude to interrupt.

34:32.069 --> 34:35.300
- Naughty Haughty.
- How's your head? Because...

34:35.324 --> 34:37.614
I feel like I can hear space and time.

34:37.639 --> 34:41.164
Hair of the dog?

34:42.039 --> 34:44.639
Officer Haught. At work?

34:44.665 --> 34:47.467
Well, some rules are made to be broken.

34:47.672 --> 34:49.739
Maybe you would be a good wife.

34:49.764 --> 34:53.130
Thank you. But you're not my type.
You cheat at drinking games.

34:58.089 --> 34:59.456
Truce?

34:59.594 --> 35:01.729
More than a truce. A win.

35:06.003 --> 35:08.704
You know, I used to think
you were an outsider too.

35:08.729 --> 35:11.898
And that things would get
too demony and you would...

35:12.271 --> 35:14.950
go and leave my sister
with a broken heart.

35:14.975 --> 35:17.684
Wynonna, I love her.

35:17.709 --> 35:19.472
Ew.

35:19.497 --> 35:21.411
Also, you'd better.

35:23.307 --> 35:25.341
And I love you, too.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.216
I mean, I know it's terribly unfair

35:27.241 --> 35:29.718
and sometimes I really get... jealous,

35:29.743 --> 35:32.169
because you get to be...

35:33.020 --> 35:35.051
Get to be what?

35:35.946 --> 35:37.761
You.

35:40.156 --> 35:43.142
You know, you're staked
to this land, same as me.

35:43.167 --> 35:45.227
You never had a choice.

35:45.252 --> 35:47.188
What do you mean?

35:51.702 --> 35:53.848
It wasn't Black Badge who saved you

35:53.873 --> 35:56.778
from the Cult of Bulshar
massacre, Nicole.

35:58.579 --> 36:01.243
It was an idealistic local cop.

36:13.201 --> 36:17.786
That little dance battle at the
vampire ball really did my back in.

36:32.696 --> 36:35.030
You were so damn scared.

36:37.071 --> 36:39.645
Still so damn tough.

36:40.213 --> 36:42.648
I found you downriver from the massacre.

36:42.673 --> 36:46.042
You'd gotten yourself into a
canoe, you got away, so...

36:47.448 --> 36:49.182
You're the one.

36:55.985 --> 36:58.575
Kept an eye on you afterwards.

36:59.170 --> 37:01.888
You know, those folks of yours...

37:02.582 --> 37:04.072
Who lets their six-year-old daughter

37:04.097 --> 37:06.543
go to a music festival in the woods?

37:06.631 --> 37:10.036
My parents were never
anything but selfish.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.762
If they could see you now.

37:11.787 --> 37:13.900
We don't talk.

37:14.354 --> 37:17.783
Why? Because of... who you are?

37:17.808 --> 37:19.257
Yeah.

37:19.282 --> 37:20.849
A cop.

37:21.135 --> 37:23.986
When I found out you'd enrolled
in the police academy,

37:24.011 --> 37:26.160
I couldn't resist offering you this job.

37:26.185 --> 37:28.735
When I saw the posting, I... I knew

37:28.760 --> 37:30.827
that this was where I had to serve.

37:34.058 --> 37:36.205
Everything good that I have in my life

37:36.230 --> 37:39.300
is because I came back to
the Ghost River Triangle.

37:44.447 --> 37:48.187
You're like a daughter... to me.

38:06.407 --> 38:08.995
You're wrinkling the
crease in my khakis.

38:17.031 --> 38:18.937
Thank you.

38:20.878 --> 38:23.906
You are a tough act to follow.

38:23.931 --> 38:26.578
I'm not going anywhere.

38:27.905 --> 38:30.267
Not if you really need me.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.396
Congratulations, Sheriff Haught.

38:34.630 --> 38:36.791
You earned it.

38:39.934 --> 38:42.869
Fill a tub with tequila
and salt the rim.

38:43.432 --> 38:45.700
I have had a day.

38:47.940 --> 38:49.474
She's gone.

38:51.827 --> 38:54.124
Went to find Julian.

39:01.586 --> 39:07.013
But we just had Christmas
together and it was so nice.

39:07.208 --> 39:09.576
We could spend our whole
lives trying to figure out

39:09.601 --> 39:12.017
why she does what she does, baby girl.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.894
We already have.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.715
At least now she really is free.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.044
Must be nice.

39:33.216 --> 39:34.783
Good evening.

39:36.677 --> 39:39.011
I come bearing gifts.

39:39.324 --> 39:41.922
Well, gift.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.372
- This is...
- Bulshar's ring.

39:50.397 --> 39:52.832
It may protect you in
your upcoming battle.

39:53.448 --> 39:56.116
How did you get it? Nicole had it.

39:56.141 --> 40:00.211
Well... the details are a little foggy.

40:00.937 --> 40:03.439
I do like to day drink, as you know.

40:03.464 --> 40:04.898
Why don't you keep it?

40:06.828 --> 40:10.397
Anyone ever tell you not to
look a gift horse in the mouth?

40:10.832 --> 40:12.929
Did you spend the day with my mother?

40:12.954 --> 40:15.414
She essentially treated
me as her Ober...

40:15.439 --> 40:16.998
Uber.

40:22.108 --> 40:24.976
What she told me may
require some explanation.

40:25.001 --> 40:26.632
She thought so, too.

40:28.407 --> 40:30.116
Lemme just read it to you.

40:30.904 --> 40:32.973
"Dear Wynonna,"

40:33.628 --> 40:36.364
don't trust Doc Holliday.

40:37.843 --> 40:40.046
"He's not what he says he is."

40:40.279 --> 40:43.172
Did she also say she set
Bobo free from the well?

40:43.197 --> 40:45.867
She does love to burn a
place down before she runs.

40:45.892 --> 40:47.758
The recklessness of her actions -

40:47.783 --> 40:50.976
I do not see how she could
remain here and keep you safe.

40:51.001 --> 40:53.101
Just tell me what you did.

40:56.244 --> 40:57.778
Who are you?

40:58.546 --> 41:01.398
- Who I've always been.
- Don't talk to me in riddles.

41:01.423 --> 41:04.132
- How should I talk to you, then?
- Like you give a shit about me.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.289
You refused me.

41:09.151 --> 41:11.945
Wynonna, I do care...

41:12.826 --> 41:15.648
You are runnin' out of road, woman.

41:15.752 --> 41:17.684
Tell me what you are.

41:24.104 --> 41:26.375
Kate.

41:27.340 --> 41:30.489
You let her do this.

41:32.170 --> 41:34.326
She had you.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.796
It was the only way.

41:36.821 --> 41:39.366
What about us?

41:39.391 --> 41:41.695
What about Alice?

41:42.544 --> 41:44.390
What would our daughter say

41:44.415 --> 41:47.928
if she knew her father sold his soul?!

41:47.953 --> 41:51.695
You of all people should understand
the sacrifices that have been made.

41:51.720 --> 41:55.296
You wanted your immortality
that badly, selfish asshole?!

41:55.321 --> 41:57.539
You watch your mouth!!

41:58.694 --> 42:00.617
Bite me.

42:03.262 --> 42:05.461
There are some...

42:06.773 --> 42:08.373
advantages...

42:09.636 --> 42:11.659
to you being a vampire.

42:12.354 --> 42:14.155
John Henry Holliday,

42:14.434 --> 42:17.332
you're not welcome in my home anymore.

42:17.357 --> 42:18.629
Don't you do this.

42:18.654 --> 42:21.332
No, you did this.

42:21.357 --> 42:23.535
Not me.
