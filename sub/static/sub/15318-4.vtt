00:03.282 --> 00:05.049
I'm saying there is
a time and a place

00:05.050 --> 00:06.985
for that type of
experimentation,

00:06.986 --> 00:08.353
but maybe,

00:08.354 --> 00:09.621
breakfast
isn't the time

00:09.622 --> 00:10.989
for salted cod.

00:10.990 --> 00:12.557
You need to expand
your horizons.

00:12.558 --> 00:14.125
No, no, no,
you need to stop

00:14.126 --> 00:15.630
making fish
for breakfast.

00:15.756 --> 00:16.722
Humans live here, too,
you know--

00:18.802 --> 00:20.636
What?

00:20.637 --> 00:22.672
You hear that?

00:23.707 --> 00:24.674
No.

00:24.675 --> 00:26.409
Catacombs.

00:26.410 --> 00:27.977
What?

00:31.682 --> 00:32.782
There.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:42.125 --> 00:43.659
Ghost accountant.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.364
Hello.

00:48.365 --> 00:49.432
What's that?

00:51.735 --> 00:53.002
Let's show the boss.

01:01.345 --> 01:02.578
Good heavens,

01:02.579 --> 01:04.413
it's been a long time
since I've seen this.

01:04.414 --> 01:06.382
Okay, so no batteries?
What gives?

01:06.383 --> 01:08.351
It's an autotype.

01:08.352 --> 01:09.552
One of only five

01:09.553 --> 01:11.854
that were built
during the second world war.

01:11.855 --> 01:14.724
Each one handcrafted
using available materials

01:14.725 --> 01:16.092
in a time
of great scarcity.

01:16.093 --> 01:17.960
I managed to
convince the inventor

01:17.961 --> 01:20.396
to give it to the office
of strategic services.

01:20.397 --> 01:22.865
Without it, the war could have
ended very differently.

01:22.866 --> 01:24.400
I heard rumors about this.

01:24.401 --> 01:25.902
The secret machine

01:25.903 --> 01:27.136
that the allies used
to communicate.

01:27.137 --> 01:27.803
I didn't think
it was real.

01:27.804 --> 01:29.438
Oh, quite real,

01:29.439 --> 01:31.807
and this one
is the only survivor.

01:31.808 --> 01:33.276
It transmits and receives

01:33.277 --> 01:35.344
a fluctuating
electro-magnetic frequency

01:35.345 --> 01:37.313
that can't be intercepted.

01:38.882 --> 01:40.716
But if this is
the last one,

01:40.717 --> 01:42.151
then where's the message
coming from?

01:44.021 --> 01:46.956
From the one man
who knew of its existence

01:46.957 --> 01:47.990
and how to use it,

01:47.991 --> 01:52.762
the inventor
of the device himself.

01:56.099 --> 01:58.301
This is a distress call...

01:59.503 --> 02:01.771
From Nikola Tesla.

02:18.349 --> 02:20.383
There's not another man alive
who could build one of these.

02:20.384 --> 02:22.685
No offense, Henry.

02:22.686 --> 02:23.887
None taken.

02:23.888 --> 02:24.921
That is
a masterpiece.

02:24.922 --> 02:26.155
You know,
it would be nice

02:26.156 --> 02:27.390
if he gave us
a little more info.

02:27.391 --> 02:29.325
Like, where he is,

02:29.326 --> 02:30.360
his situation,

02:30.361 --> 02:31.160
what his danger
level is?

02:31.161 --> 02:31.995
Picked up
a phone?

02:31.996 --> 02:33.496
At the very least.

02:33.497 --> 02:35.865
If Nikola resorted to this
method of communication,

02:35.866 --> 02:37.367
he obviously has
very few options.

02:37.368 --> 02:38.801
Henry, were you
able to pinpoint

02:38.802 --> 02:40.270
the origin
of the signal?

02:40.271 --> 02:42.105
Yeah, it cycles through
half a dozen frequencies,

02:42.106 --> 02:43.640
but the pattern repeats,

02:43.641 --> 02:45.441
so I got a pretty good lock
on the general location.

02:45.442 --> 02:48.678
300 klicks West of cartagena
in the colombian highlands.

02:48.679 --> 02:50.213
The signal fades
in and out.

02:50.214 --> 02:51.581
That means it's
fighting interference,

02:51.582 --> 02:52.916
so it could be
underground.

02:52.917 --> 02:54.717
All right, we'll pick up
local transport there.

02:54.718 --> 02:55.785
Will, Henry,
you're with me.

02:55.786 --> 02:58.021
We leave in an hour.

02:59.957 --> 03:01.824
You know he's playing
with us, right?

03:01.825 --> 03:03.793
He's probably
laughing his ass off

03:03.794 --> 03:05.895
in some cafe in Paris,

03:05.896 --> 03:07.997
about sending us
on a wild goose chase

03:07.998 --> 03:09.866
to rural Colombia.

03:09.867 --> 03:11.167
Why would he
do that?

03:11.168 --> 03:12.302
Why?

03:12.303 --> 03:13.770
You never know why
with this guy,

03:13.771 --> 03:15.772
but he's always
up to something.

03:15.773 --> 03:17.173
You're not wrong
about that,

03:17.174 --> 03:18.675
but aren't you
at least curious

03:18.676 --> 03:19.742
as to what it is
this time?

03:19.743 --> 03:22.211
It's a set-up,
Magnus, a trap.

03:22.212 --> 03:24.847
That's what he does,
how he rolls,

03:24.848 --> 03:26.249
his modus operandi.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.750
Yes...

03:27.751 --> 03:29.919
What if he's posing as the king
of a lost mountain tribe

03:29.920 --> 03:30.920
and he wants me for his queen?

03:32.156 --> 03:35.725
Or what if he actually
needs our help?

03:35.726 --> 03:36.726
Fine.

03:36.727 --> 03:38.127
I'll get my stuff together.

03:40.064 --> 03:41.431
The man comes with
a hidden agenda,

03:41.432 --> 03:42.865
every time.

03:44.134 --> 03:45.802
Every time!

03:47.738 --> 03:50.206
That's what makes him
so interesting.

03:52.776 --> 03:55.378
<i>This week</i>
<i>on operation paranormal,</i>

03:55.379 --> 03:58.681
<i>deep in the warehouse district</i>
<i>of old city,</i>

03:58.682 --> 04:00.783
<i>the site of several</i>
<i>unexplained deaths</i>

04:00.784 --> 04:05.755
<i>and paranormal sightings</i>
<i>two years ago...</i>

04:08.225 --> 04:10.827
Uh, what a clusterhump
that was.

04:10.828 --> 04:12.829
First of all, the flight
out of skagway

04:12.830 --> 04:14.397
didn't have a proper
freight hold.

04:14.398 --> 04:16.298
Ï the crew, it was planning
on loading the crate

04:16.300 --> 04:18.301
and the creature
separately,

04:18.302 --> 04:20.003
and I'm like,
"whoa, people,

04:20.004 --> 04:22.271
it's a sub-arctic crocatta,
not a corgi.

04:22.272 --> 04:23.773
Keep it away from
other frequent fliers!"

04:26.010 --> 04:27.343
Ended up chartering
a private plane

04:27.344 --> 04:29.212
and getting it
here solo.

04:29.213 --> 04:31.414
Freezy's all tucked
away downstairs.

04:31.415 --> 04:32.882
Where's the doc?

04:32.883 --> 04:34.384
Cartagena.

04:34.385 --> 04:36.319
Oh. Will too?

04:36.320 --> 04:38.054
Uh-huh.

04:38.055 --> 04:39.856
And Hank?

04:41.158 --> 04:44.293
Did they...
Need me down there?

04:44.294 --> 04:45.795
Didn't mention it.

04:47.031 --> 04:48.331
Oh.

04:52.002 --> 04:54.470
Whatcha working on?

04:54.471 --> 04:57.106
I was cataloging
the library.

04:57.107 --> 05:00.009
Oh, please,
don't play a player.

05:00.010 --> 05:02.178
I saw you hit the panic button.

05:02.179 --> 05:04.947
What's the guilty
pleasure?

05:13.857 --> 05:14.957
Oh-ho, nice!

05:16.393 --> 05:18.428
Hey, what do you say
you ditch the cleaning gear

05:18.429 --> 05:20.530
and we'll fire it up
in the media room instead?

05:20.531 --> 05:22.365
Hmm...

05:22.366 --> 05:23.800
I got too much work to do.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.134
Aw, come on, the cat's away.

05:25.135 --> 05:26.135
Live a little.

05:27.438 --> 05:29.305
I suppose I could finish
this tomorrow.

05:29.306 --> 05:31.240
That's the spirit.

05:31.241 --> 05:32.241
Okay, start without me.

05:32.242 --> 05:34.143
I am gonna take
the longest hot shower

05:34.144 --> 05:35.411
in sanctuary history.

05:42.019 --> 05:43.519
How close are we?

05:43.520 --> 05:46.155
About another
50 meters.

05:46.156 --> 05:48.391
Straight down.

05:48.392 --> 05:50.393
Of course it is.

05:50.394 --> 05:52.829
This is me
staying positive.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.897
These mountains are
swiss-cheesed with caverns.

05:54.898 --> 05:56.199
According to the topo maps,

05:56.200 --> 05:57.800
there's an opening
not far from here.

05:57.801 --> 05:59.502
Hope you brought
your headlamps,

05:59.503 --> 06:01.504
which I know you did,
because I packed them for you.

06:03.474 --> 06:05.541
Every time.

06:20.124 --> 06:21.390
Maybe he's building

06:21.391 --> 06:22.525
the mother of all
wine cellars.

06:22.526 --> 06:23.559
Tesla?

06:23.560 --> 06:24.927
It's not exactly

06:24.928 --> 06:26.829
the Mayan riviera down here.

06:26.830 --> 06:29.832
The man has always had
expensive taste.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.634
Well, stay alert,
both of you.

06:31.635 --> 06:33.302
I don't like this either.

06:35.906 --> 06:38.508
<i>I need some equipment</i>
<i>for here.</i>

06:38.509 --> 06:41.544
<i>This is definitely,</i>

06:41.545 --> 06:43.546
<i>definitely something</i>
<i>we should be looking at...</i>

06:43.547 --> 06:46.883
Season four
Halloween special.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.352
Fort Delaware?

06:49.353 --> 06:51.454
Huh...

06:51.455 --> 06:53.489
Spooky.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.573
<i>Here's Sherilee Wilkins</i>
<i>with a channel 13 news report.</i>

07:10.574 --> 07:13.609
<i>Tragedy tonight</i>
<i>in the notorious fifth ward</i>

07:13.610 --> 07:16.279
<i>after the shocking death</i>
<i>of a long-time priest</i>

<i>at Saint Michael's church.</i>

07:17.614 --> 07:19.515
<i>Father Nathaniel Jensen</i>
<i>was found dead</i>

07:19.516 --> 07:22.218
<i>after apparently interrupting</i>
<i>a burglary in progress</i>

07:22.219 --> 07:24.120
<i>inside his own church.</i>

07:24.121 --> 07:26.022
<i>Known for his work</i>
<i>with the homeless of the ward,</i>

07:26.023 --> 07:29.926
<i>Father Jensen came</i>
<i>to St. Michael's in 1949,</i>

07:29.927 --> 07:33.262
<i>and has remained a fixture</i>
<i>in the community ever since.</i>

07:33.263 --> 07:36.032
I have to go.

07:36.033 --> 07:37.433
<i>...Despite</i>
<i>declining attendance</i>

07:37.434 --> 07:38.467
<i>and the deterioration</i>
<i>of the neighborhood...</i>

07:38.468 --> 07:40.469
What about
the 2:00 a.m. feedings?

07:40.470 --> 07:42.371
You said you'd help!

07:42.372 --> 07:44.173
<i>...Police are investigating</i>

07:44.174 --> 07:46.509
<i>and promise a list of suspects</i>

<i>Again, father Nathaniel Jensen,</i>

07:48.278 --> 07:50.213
<i>murdered in the fifth ward.</i>

07:50.214 --> 07:51.781
<i>A community in shock.</i>

07:51.782 --> 07:54.450
<i>This is Sherilee Wilkins,</i>
<i>channel 13 eyewitness news.</i>

07:56.119 --> 07:58.120
Really high
iron content in these walls.

07:58.121 --> 07:59.055
Massive.

07:59.056 --> 07:59.956
Interesting.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.294
What is that?

08:05.295 --> 08:06.629
Some kind of vine?

08:06.630 --> 08:08.531
It's not vegetal.

08:08.532 --> 08:10.233
It appears fragile,

08:10.234 --> 08:11.567
but it's tougher
than it looks.

08:11.568 --> 08:13.236
We're not going to run into
a giant spider, are we?

08:13.237 --> 08:14.971
'Cause I'm really done
with those.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.272
Highly doubtful.

08:16.273 --> 08:17.874
This material doesn't have

08:17.875 --> 08:19.942
the alternating crystalline
structure of spider silk.

08:19.943 --> 08:21.544
It's more like
a protein column

08:21.545 --> 08:23.246
surrounding a hollow core.

08:23.247 --> 08:24.380
What, like hair?

08:24.381 --> 08:25.281
Or veins.

08:25.282 --> 08:26.716
That actually sounds worse.

08:26.717 --> 08:29.051
So it's not made
by anybody we know?

08:29.052 --> 08:31.587
Nothing comes to
mind, I'm afraid.

08:31.588 --> 08:32.989
That's comforting.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.222
Yeah, but
not really.

08:34.224 --> 08:37.393
On your toes, gentlemen.

08:53.510 --> 08:54.343
...He's got a couple places...

09:12.129 --> 09:13.296
Good evening.

09:13.297 --> 09:14.397
Hello there.

09:14.398 --> 09:16.399
Cold out tonight.

09:50.267 --> 09:52.301
Here, take my hand.

09:55.339 --> 09:56.505
Oh, my God.

09:56.506 --> 09:59.675
What are you?

10:03.413 --> 10:05.681
What have they done to you?

10:07.084 --> 10:08.718
My name is
father Jensen.

10:08.719 --> 10:10.219
You're with me now.

10:10.220 --> 10:11.620
They won't
hurt you anymore,

10:11.621 --> 10:13.489
I promise you.

10:15.525 --> 10:17.593
I've heard of a place

10:17.594 --> 10:20.463
where all God's creatures
are offered safety,

10:20.464 --> 10:22.765
a sanctuary.

10:59.903 --> 11:01.871
I am so sorry, big guy.

11:01.872 --> 11:06.809
He helped abnormals
find the sanctuary.

11:06.810 --> 11:09.345
He knew the risks.

11:09.346 --> 11:14.150
Was never afraid.

11:16.553 --> 11:18.954
He did not deserve this.

11:20.590 --> 11:22.491
Sounds like a good guy.

11:22.492 --> 11:24.560
More than that.

11:26.163 --> 11:29.231
He was a friend.

11:35.739 --> 11:36.839
Okay, listen up!

11:36.840 --> 11:38.808
The city worker
id'ed a suspect.

11:38.809 --> 11:41.777
We need a last-known
on a denny Stefano.

11:41.778 --> 11:42.945
We should already have
a jacket on the guy.

11:42.946 --> 11:46.682
So call your wives, hubbies,
life partners,

11:46.683 --> 11:48.184
everyone works tonight.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.619
Denny's been known to deal
around near the waterfront.

11:50.620 --> 11:54.657
Let's start combing
through the warehouses.

11:57.494 --> 11:59.528
E.M. Is strongest here.

11:59.529 --> 12:01.964
Whatever it is, we're close.

12:01.965 --> 12:03.399
Well, well,

12:03.400 --> 12:05.000
will miracles never cease?

12:05.001 --> 12:07.703
Nikola, my God...

12:07.704 --> 12:09.371
Yeah, look away.
I'm hideous.

12:09.372 --> 12:10.973
How bad is it?

12:10.974 --> 12:13.776
Uh, can you just pull me
out of this thing please?

12:13.777 --> 12:15.344
How long you been down here?

12:15.345 --> 12:16.745
Well, let's see now,

12:16.746 --> 12:18.481
nine days, seven hours.

12:18.482 --> 12:19.782
You know, I wish
I'd stopped counting,

12:19.783 --> 12:21.283
but it's just not in my nature.

12:21.284 --> 12:22.284
Here.

12:22.285 --> 12:23.519
Thank you.

12:24.654 --> 12:25.888
Ah...

12:27.424 --> 12:28.924
How did this happen?

12:28.925 --> 12:30.593
Well, it's a long story, and
one which I'd be happy to tell

12:30.594 --> 12:32.394
over a nice meal

12:32.395 --> 12:33.462
someplace far away from here.

12:33.463 --> 12:34.563
Okay, this stuff

12:34.564 --> 12:35.898
is incredibly strong.
It's going to take--

12:35.899 --> 12:38.234
we really shouldn't dally.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.335
What do we need to know?

12:39.336 --> 12:40.569
Mainly?

12:40.570 --> 12:41.871
We have to get out of here
right now.

12:41.872 --> 12:43.005
These are not
naturally occurring.

12:43.006 --> 12:44.306
A creature made them.

12:44.307 --> 12:46.809
Yeah, and, uh,
they're far from pleasant.

12:46.810 --> 12:47.843
Okay, faster it is, then.

12:47.844 --> 12:48.811
Hold on, Nikola.

12:48.812 --> 12:49.712
Won't be long.

12:50.780 --> 12:51.914
Hold still, genius.

12:58.488 --> 13:00.322
Ah...

13:00.323 --> 13:02.925
You look fabulous, by the way.

13:09.533 --> 13:10.833
Earthquake?

13:10.834 --> 13:12.434
Get me out.

13:12.435 --> 13:13.435
Get me out,
get me out!

13:13.436 --> 13:15.504
Argh, oh, man!

13:15.505 --> 13:16.405
Keep working!

13:18.742 --> 13:19.575
Almost there.

13:23.780 --> 13:24.813
Yeah!

13:28.652 --> 13:30.953
Is that another
surprise from Tesla?

13:31.922 --> 13:32.988
What is that?

13:32.989 --> 13:33.923
I've never seen anything
like that before.

13:36.426 --> 13:37.960
Aw, crap.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.363
Great. Nice rescue.

13:45.735 --> 13:46.711
Seriously,
what the hell are those?

13:46.811 --> 13:49.479
Some sort of hybrid insect.
We must be in their territory.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.615
We didn't know that?

13:51.616 --> 13:52.782
I really think
we should get out of here.

13:54.485 --> 13:57.921
Ah, these are useless.
Henry, switch to stunners!

14:07.131 --> 14:09.032
Oh, good.
They don't like voltage.

14:09.033 --> 14:10.200
Well, it's a start.

14:10.201 --> 14:11.101
Can you walk?

14:11.102 --> 14:12.936
Of course.
I can--

14:12.937 --> 14:14.504
whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:15.506 --> 14:16.740
My God.

14:16.741 --> 14:17.974
I got you,
I got you...

14:20.177 --> 14:21.945
Strategic little buggers.

14:24.115 --> 14:26.449
This way!
Go! Go!

14:26.450 --> 14:28.585
Come on...

14:40.731 --> 14:41.998
Boys?

14:52.643 --> 14:54.844
All right, I got to stop.

14:54.845 --> 14:55.946
Well, that should
buy us some time.

14:58.582 --> 15:01.918
Well, I did say
sos in my message.

15:01.919 --> 15:03.653
"Trapped in a cave
with nasty bugs"

15:03.654 --> 15:04.788
would have been
much more helpful.

15:04.789 --> 15:05.956
If only you knew
what it took

15:05.957 --> 15:06.990
to get those
three letters out.

15:06.991 --> 15:08.892
All right, we should
recon this tunnel,

15:08.893 --> 15:09.993
find a way
back to the surface.

15:09.994 --> 15:11.494
Yeah, I second that.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.930
Not too far.

15:18.569 --> 15:21.204
All right, what were you
doing down here really?

15:21.205 --> 15:22.238
What does it matter?

15:22.239 --> 15:24.541
Obviously it didn't work out,
did it?

15:26.744 --> 15:28.611
Get your
strength back.

15:28.612 --> 15:31.147
I suspect you're
going to need it.

15:31.148 --> 15:34.918
Helen...

15:36.020 --> 15:37.787
Thank you.

15:56.607 --> 15:59.142
You know who I am?

15:59.143 --> 16:00.210
Hey, man,
I don't want to know--

16:02.646 --> 16:05.715
Denny Stefano,
you made a big mistake tonight.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.917
You killed a friend of mine.

16:07.918 --> 16:09.853
Witnesses saw you run
from the church.

16:09.854 --> 16:11.521
What, the priest?

16:11.522 --> 16:13.189
No way, man.

16:13.190 --> 16:14.891
You got the wrong guy.
I never--

16:14.892 --> 16:18.595
do not lie to me.

16:19.764 --> 16:22.632
Wasn't even there, man.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.601
Listen, someone's
trying to pin this on me.

16:24.602 --> 16:25.769
Why?

16:25.770 --> 16:27.604
To get me
off the street!

16:27.605 --> 16:31.241
Payback for some
other rip-off I did.

16:31.242 --> 16:32.308
Who cares?

16:32.309 --> 16:33.943
The cops are doggin' me now.

16:33.944 --> 16:35.545
Look at me.

16:35.546 --> 16:37.313
Killing a priest?

16:37.314 --> 16:39.249
They'll just shoot me
"resisting,"

16:39.250 --> 16:41.251
save themselves the paperwork!

16:43.654 --> 16:45.288
I'm done, man!

16:58.135 --> 17:01.571
You're not done.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.907
Whole lot of
nothing.

17:04.909 --> 17:05.875
None of these
connecting tunnels

17:05.876 --> 17:07.277
lead upward.

17:07.278 --> 17:08.144
Yeah, none of this stuff
works down here.

17:08.145 --> 17:09.079
Yay, team.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.246
These creatures
resemble

17:10.247 --> 17:11.614
subterranean
centipedes,

17:11.615 --> 17:12.714
but with significant
differences.

17:12.715 --> 17:13.715
Allow me.

17:13.717 --> 17:14.684
They're huge.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.185
And their behavior.

17:16.186 --> 17:17.987
They attacked
in coordinated waves,

17:17.988 --> 17:19.155
but chilopodes
don't normally operate

17:19.156 --> 17:20.390
on hive mentality.

17:20.391 --> 17:22.759
And you just happened
to get trapped by them.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.027
God, that's so weird.

17:24.028 --> 17:25.028
Yeah, down, junior.

17:25.029 --> 17:26.195
I didn't know
they were here

17:26.196 --> 17:27.063
until they tried
to make me

17:27.064 --> 17:28.330
part of the architecture.

17:28.332 --> 17:29.165
And yet they wanted
to keep you alive,

17:29.166 --> 17:29.899
but they tried to kill us. Why?

17:29.900 --> 17:31.267
Well, I don't know.

17:31.268 --> 17:32.836
Maybe I taste good with
a decent bechamel sauce.

17:32.837 --> 17:34.237
I forgot to ask them, sorry.

17:34.238 --> 17:35.138
All right,

17:35.139 --> 17:36.172
sympathy time's over, Nikola.

17:36.173 --> 17:37.707
Spill it.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.309
All right.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.311
You're aware of the iron
deposits in these caves?

17:41.312 --> 17:42.712
Yeah, what
about it?

17:42.713 --> 17:44.681
Highest concentration
of natural lodestone

17:44.682 --> 17:45.648
in the Western hemisphere.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.684
To you,
it means nothing.

17:47.685 --> 17:49.953
To me,
manna from heaven.

17:49.954 --> 17:50.987
Your magnetic powers.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.922
Here it comes.

17:52.923 --> 17:54.124
Oh, come on.

17:54.125 --> 17:55.658
I'm just looking
for a way back on top.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.227
I mean, being
a living magnet,

17:57.228 --> 17:58.995
it's not exactly on par
with being heir

17:58.996 --> 18:00.363
to the greatest race
in all of history.

18:00.364 --> 18:02.031
It even has
a few drawbacks,

18:02.032 --> 18:03.299
like, if you're not careful,

18:03.300 --> 18:04.901
your razor gets stuck
to your face.

18:04.902 --> 18:05.969
So... what?

18:05.970 --> 18:07.804
I'm just looking for a way

18:07.805 --> 18:10.773
to turn this pointless ability
into something extraordinary.

18:10.774 --> 18:12.242
So you went after

18:12.243 --> 18:13.443
the most powerful
natural magnetic substance

18:13.444 --> 18:14.310
in the world.

18:14.311 --> 18:15.378
You're damn right I did.

18:15.379 --> 18:17.847
It makes sense,
in an evil way.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.182
Oh, please.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.850
Can we stop with
the value judgments?

18:20.851 --> 18:22.752
Hey, man, live
and let live, I say.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.220
You know what I say?

18:24.221 --> 18:26.356
I say you got yourself into
a little bit of trouble,

18:26.357 --> 18:27.891
and you dragged us
into the mess too.

18:27.892 --> 18:29.425
So stop whining about it.

18:29.426 --> 18:30.860
I thought helping people was
part of your job description.

18:30.861 --> 18:32.362
Yeah, people.

18:32.363 --> 18:34.764
You, Professor hidden agenda,
not so much.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.065
We need a way
out of here,

18:36.066 --> 18:37.133
and we need
to keep moving.

18:37.134 --> 18:38.902
How's your strength?

18:38.903 --> 18:40.970
Carry me?

18:49.146 --> 18:50.146
So we're fine

18:50.147 --> 18:54.751
as long as we stay off
the bugs' turf.

18:54.752 --> 18:57.253
I love our little
field trips.

18:57.254 --> 18:58.922
Hey, listen, um,

18:58.923 --> 18:59.989
I've been
wanting to ask you

18:59.990 --> 19:01.457
about the e.M. Signal
that you sent out.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.826
For days before anyone
noticed, I might add.

19:03.827 --> 19:06.396
Yeah, still waiting
for a thank you.

19:06.397 --> 19:10.099
Anyway, you were able
to get the autotype going

19:10.100 --> 19:12.168
without any kind of
transmitter on this end.

19:12.169 --> 19:13.903
Well, you do know
what "e.M." Stands for,

19:13.904 --> 19:15.271
don't you?

19:15.272 --> 19:17.040
And while I may not be
as "electro" as I once was,

19:17.041 --> 19:19.309
but being extra magnetic
has a few uses, I suppose.

19:19.310 --> 19:21.010
Yeah, I get how you could
generate a signal

19:21.011 --> 19:22.245
by clenching your kegels
or whatever,

19:22.246 --> 19:25.114
but how did you
get the range?

19:25.115 --> 19:26.683
Oh, you obviously didn't do
any aerial mapping

19:26.684 --> 19:28.184
on your way in.

19:28.185 --> 19:29.719
Had you, you might have ticed
the amplification properties

19:29.720 --> 19:30.720
of the local terrain.

19:30.721 --> 19:33.156
A parabolic focus point.

19:33.157 --> 19:34.224
Okay, well, then,

19:34.225 --> 19:35.258
wouldn't there be
secondary signals--

19:35.259 --> 19:36.292
hey, shh!
Shh, shh...

19:36.293 --> 19:37.794
Stop.

19:37.795 --> 19:38.861
You'll hurt yourself,

19:38.862 --> 19:40.263
and I'm feeling
far too tired

19:40.264 --> 19:42.298
to feign concern.

19:42.299 --> 19:44.901
You're welcome.

19:44.902 --> 19:46.336
Jackass...

19:52.176 --> 19:53.009
Huh...

19:53.010 --> 19:54.877
Concrete and steel.

19:54.878 --> 19:56.246
Rebar supports,
reinforced ceiling.

19:57.881 --> 19:59.782
There wasn't anything
in the topo maps

19:59.783 --> 20:01.017
about mining operations
in the area.

20:01.018 --> 20:04.454
Well, something
man-made is down here.

20:06.824 --> 20:08.925
I know that look.

20:08.926 --> 20:10.393
Well, well.

20:10.394 --> 20:14.897
Maybe this trip might not be
such a bust after all.

20:19.403 --> 20:21.838
I know. Every time.

20:33.284 --> 20:36.286
An unmarked bunker
under the andes.

20:36.287 --> 20:38.755
Fancy that, huh?

20:38.756 --> 20:40.757
Nikola...

20:40.758 --> 20:42.458
Don't use that
tone of voice with me.

20:42.459 --> 20:46.262
Hey, need I remind you
I'm the victim here, okay?

20:46.263 --> 20:47.930
You knew about this place
all along.

20:47.931 --> 20:49.499
In fact, I'll wager

20:49.500 --> 20:51.134
it's the real reason
you were down here.

20:51.135 --> 20:52.468
What about
the lodestone deposits?

20:52.469 --> 20:53.736
Mmm...

20:53.737 --> 20:55.938
Aw, dammit,
that sounded so cool.

20:55.939 --> 20:57.507
Not the kind of guy
who says "I told you so..."

20:57.508 --> 20:58.675
Talk.

20:58.676 --> 20:59.542
Fine.

20:59.543 --> 21:01.978
Move!

21:06.250 --> 21:07.817
Nikola, the door!

21:20.030 --> 21:22.899
All right,
what is this place?

21:22.900 --> 21:23.966
As I was
trying to say

21:23.967 --> 21:25.835
before I was
interrupted,

21:25.836 --> 21:27.970
we are standing
in the wreckage

21:27.971 --> 21:30.006
of a secret laboratory

21:30.007 --> 21:31.307
belonging to
your old enemy,

21:31.308 --> 21:33.109
the Cabal.

21:40.499 --> 21:43.801
Must've been a secure
off-site location,

21:44.528 --> 21:45.981
some kind of research lab.

21:46.081 --> 21:47.281
Bad guys were doing

21:47.282 --> 21:49.550
some seriously
secret work down here.

21:49.551 --> 21:50.618
It would explain
your interest

21:50.619 --> 21:51.719
in such a place.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.753
It would.

21:52.754 --> 21:54.421
Whatever
happened here,

21:54.422 --> 21:55.923
it was a while ago.

21:55.924 --> 21:57.625
This damage is old.

21:57.626 --> 21:58.792
Maybe a year,

21:58.793 --> 22:01.662
which means maybe it was druitt.

22:01.663 --> 22:02.930
No, Johnny and I did do

22:02.931 --> 22:04.565
some serious damage
to the Cabal after...

22:05.767 --> 22:07.034
After events,

22:07.035 --> 22:09.069
but we never
found this place.

22:09.070 --> 22:10.704
Someone else
attacked them then?

22:10.705 --> 22:11.705
Well, see,

22:11.706 --> 22:13.440
the way the door is blown out,

22:13.441 --> 22:15.009
and the carbon scoring
on the walls,

22:15.010 --> 22:16.644
these key systems damaged,

22:16.645 --> 22:18.545
seems kind of precise to me.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.880
Maybe a self-destruct.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.382
Makes sense.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.816
Once their operations
started falling,

22:22.817 --> 22:24.118
they were covering
9heir own tracks.

22:24.119 --> 22:26.787
Scorched the earth
behind them.

22:26.788 --> 22:28.122
I'm glad we made them
this nervous.

22:28.123 --> 22:29.456
That's how you got

22:29.457 --> 22:30.958
your distress
signal to us.

22:30.959 --> 22:33.727
You knew this old
communications array

22:33.728 --> 22:35.029
would be somewhere above you.

22:35.030 --> 22:37.097
This--

22:37.098 --> 22:38.399
there was no
parabolic focus point.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.800
Yeah, yeah, but admit it,

22:39.801 --> 22:40.668
you liked
the other version better.

22:40.669 --> 22:42.936
Henry, try to
get us some power

22:42.937 --> 22:44.805
and salvage any security systems
that you can.

22:44.806 --> 22:46.974
We're still vulnerable
to these creatures here.

22:48.543 --> 22:49.877
You are a cold man.

22:52.714 --> 22:54.148
Well, the existence
of this lab

22:54.149 --> 22:55.883
would explain
the multipedes.

22:55.884 --> 22:58.452
Likely, they're products

22:58.453 --> 22:59.620
of the research that was
being performing here.

22:59.621 --> 23:01.055
A little subterranean
monster-making?

23:01.056 --> 23:02.623
Right up their alley.

23:02.624 --> 23:04.658
These people
were carrying out

23:04.659 --> 23:06.093
nothing but the most egregious,

23:06.094 --> 23:07.628
unethical research
on abnormals.

23:07.629 --> 23:08.729
What could you possibly want

23:08.730 --> 23:11.632
down here?

23:11.633 --> 23:12.633
Answer me!

23:12.634 --> 23:15.135
I want my life back!

23:15.136 --> 23:16.503
Look at me, Helen.

23:16.504 --> 23:19.573
I'm reduced to parlor tricks
and morse code.

23:19.574 --> 23:22.009
I can't even
get out of a cobweb

23:22.010 --> 23:23.610
without help
from these chumps.

23:23.611 --> 23:24.745
What am I now?

23:24.746 --> 23:25.846
Human with...

23:25.847 --> 23:26.747
With benefits?

23:26.748 --> 23:28.015
It's pathetic!

23:48.002 --> 23:49.103
<i>Voila.</i>

23:49.104 --> 23:50.704
Emergency lighting.

23:50.705 --> 23:51.839
Nice.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.006
It's a start,
thank you, Henry,

23:53.007 --> 23:54.975
but we need defenses.

23:54.976 --> 23:56.410
Well, they don't
seem to be able

23:56.411 --> 23:57.711
to get through the steel
and concrete.

23:57.712 --> 23:58.879
I think we're safe down here.

24:01.850 --> 24:02.916
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

24:02.917 --> 24:04.685
Security systems,
I'm on it.

24:04.686 --> 24:07.154
All right, so what about
the lab's database?

24:07.155 --> 24:08.956
If we can access that,
we can, you know,

24:08.957 --> 24:10.290
figure out
what these creatures are.

24:10.291 --> 24:12.092
More specifically,
how to deal with them.

24:13.261 --> 24:14.995
Oh, that's...
This is not easy.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.264
Even routing through
the physical damage,

24:17.265 --> 24:19.066
I keep running into
dead sectors.

24:19.067 --> 24:20.834
These drives
are wiped clean.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.603
Mr. foss, just
let your imagination

24:22.604 --> 24:24.037
conceive for a moment

24:24.038 --> 24:26.106
of a tool that can read
magnetic fields

24:26.107 --> 24:28.509
as a blind man can read braille.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.111
Now, what would you do
with a tool like that

24:31.112 --> 24:32.980
in a situation like this?

24:32.981 --> 24:35.149
Well, I suppose
a negative impression

24:35.150 --> 24:36.650
would be on the degausser
from the deleted info,

24:36.651 --> 24:38.018
but it would be
so faint,

24:38.019 --> 24:39.119
you'd practically need
a hadron collider

24:39.120 --> 24:40.788
just to access it.

24:40.789 --> 24:42.890
Or...

24:44.292 --> 24:45.859
No way.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.928
You can work at that level?

24:49.030 --> 24:50.297
Care to assist?

24:50.298 --> 24:52.065
Hell, yeah!

24:52.066 --> 24:53.333
I-I mean,
you know, whatever.

24:53.334 --> 24:54.902
Find out
what you can.

24:56.104 --> 24:58.639
So you're sure
he wasn't the killer?

24:58.640 --> 25:00.140
He's not exactly
an upstanding citizen.

25:00.141 --> 25:01.208
He's innocent.

25:01.209 --> 25:02.776
His fear scent
was too strong.

25:02.777 --> 25:04.111
Okay, well,
if you're right,

25:04.112 --> 25:05.612
with the number of cops
looking for him,

25:05.613 --> 25:06.914
he's safer in here.

25:06.915 --> 25:08.949
So, what have you got?

25:08.950 --> 25:11.652
Assuming whoever's framing
this kid is the real killer,

25:11.653 --> 25:13.020
they'd have to plant evidence

25:13.021 --> 25:14.788
to make him look like
a real suspect.

25:14.789 --> 25:16.256
You think it's a cop?

25:16.257 --> 25:17.324
Yeah.

25:20.128 --> 25:22.696
Stanley O'Farrell,
homicide.

25:22.697 --> 25:23.797
Lead investigating officer.

25:23.798 --> 25:25.232
15 years clean,

25:25.233 --> 25:26.733
citations for valor,

25:26.734 --> 25:28.068
above and beyond
the call,

25:28.069 --> 25:29.269
but...

25:29.270 --> 25:31.572
He had complete access
to the crime scene

25:31.573 --> 25:32.973
and the evidence.

25:32.974 --> 25:34.641
He could pull
all the strings

25:34.642 --> 25:35.876
to set him up
if he wanted to.

25:35.877 --> 25:37.144
The only problem is

25:37.145 --> 25:39.746
that the profile
doesn't fit.

25:39.747 --> 25:40.948
I saw him at the church.

25:40.949 --> 25:43.383
Something
wasn't right.

25:43.384 --> 25:45.686
Body language, voice tone,

25:45.687 --> 25:46.620
all wrong.

25:46.621 --> 25:48.188
You think maybe he's lost it?

25:48.189 --> 25:49.957
Or he's an abnormal.

25:49.958 --> 25:53.160
Father j might have been
trying to help him.

25:53.161 --> 25:54.795
And got killed
for his troubles?

25:57.799 --> 25:59.299
We need to bring this guy in,

25:59.300 --> 26:00.868
whatever he is.

26:00.869 --> 26:02.669
Shouldn't be a problem.

26:22.657 --> 26:25.826
Okay, boot sector is live,
directories are coming online.

26:25.827 --> 26:26.960
Now, there's a lot
of corrupted files,

26:26.961 --> 26:29.229
but I can access
the security protocols,

26:29.230 --> 26:30.964
oh, and, uh,
blueprints.

26:30.965 --> 26:31.798
Nice work, Henry.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.234
"Nice work, Henry?"

26:34.235 --> 26:36.103
You're both brilliant.

26:37.338 --> 26:38.872
There's still
one drive

26:38.873 --> 26:40.173
that we haven't
been able to access.

26:40.174 --> 26:41.108
Now, are you sure
you can't defrag

26:41.109 --> 26:42.142
that last one?

26:42.143 --> 26:43.010
It didn't seem

26:43.011 --> 26:44.044
any worse
than the others.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.648
Hello? Dude?

26:47.649 --> 26:48.682
Huh?

26:48.683 --> 26:49.816
Yes, yes, yes,
I'm trying.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.718
Just give me
a moment here.

26:51.719 --> 26:54.321
What are you doing?

26:54.322 --> 26:56.323
You already defragged it.
Why didn't you tell me?

26:56.324 --> 26:57.791
Yeah, why?

26:57.792 --> 26:59.726
Nikola...

26:59.727 --> 27:01.662
I-I can explain.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.796
Oh, I don't
believe this.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.700
I'm even at a loss here.

27:15.710 --> 27:16.910
The source blood?

27:16.911 --> 27:18.078
That's what you came here

27:18.079 --> 27:19.012
to find?

27:19.013 --> 27:20.681
It was
never recovered

27:20.682 --> 27:21.915
when we took down
the Cabal.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.850
They shipped it here
to conduct research.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.252
I was desperate,

27:25.253 --> 27:26.453
and I thought
enough time had passed--

27:26.454 --> 27:28.055
they used it on my daughter!

27:28.056 --> 27:30.724
The source blood has
value to us all, Helen.

27:30.725 --> 27:31.825
You selfish bastard.

27:38.733 --> 27:40.801
Was Ashley here?

27:43.404 --> 27:45.439
Yeah, I could type in
a few key words.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.507
Look, maybe we don't
need to know this.

27:47.508 --> 27:48.875
No, we can
download the data,

27:48.876 --> 27:50.043
we can take it
with us--

27:50.044 --> 27:51.211
you've done enough,
thank you.

27:57.819 --> 27:59.920
No. No,
Ashley wasn't here.

27:59.921 --> 28:01.955
This is
a bio-chem lab.

28:01.956 --> 28:03.790
And the source blood?

28:03.791 --> 28:07.194
Yeah, it was here.
Past tense.

28:07.195 --> 28:08.428
It was destroyed
along with everything else

28:08.429 --> 28:10.764
in the blast.

28:10.765 --> 28:12.466
Easy come, easy go.

28:12.467 --> 28:13.333
Helen--

28:13.334 --> 28:15.736
find us a way out of here.

28:18.272 --> 28:20.173
Magnus...

28:20.174 --> 28:22.376
If the source blood
was destroyed

28:22.377 --> 28:23.510
during the self destruct,

28:23.511 --> 28:25.145
then chances are

28:25.146 --> 28:27.180
remnants of it could have
seeped into the ground

28:27.181 --> 28:29.182
and attached themselves

28:29.183 --> 28:32.853
to the mineral content
of the rock.

28:32.854 --> 28:35.155
Yeah, but
why would that--

28:35.156 --> 28:37.391
oh, no.

28:37.392 --> 28:38.925
Come on, seriously?

28:38.926 --> 28:40.360
Yeah.

28:40.361 --> 28:41.561
It would explain
the size and aggression

28:41.562 --> 28:42.829
of the multipedes.

28:42.830 --> 28:45.232
And why they kept me prisoner
instead of killing me.

28:45.233 --> 28:46.400
Same blood type.

28:46.401 --> 28:47.601
Remember
what you said

28:47.602 --> 28:48.668
about territorial
behavior?

28:48.669 --> 28:50.404
They seemed to get
really mad

28:50.405 --> 28:54.174
when we locked them
out of the lab.

28:59.047 --> 29:01.782
I'm guessing this is why.

29:18.866 --> 29:20.167
Oh, man...

29:28.309 --> 29:29.943
We're in their nest.

29:36.808 --> 29:37.774
We're under
the kids' bunk beds.

29:37.775 --> 29:38.642
No wonder the grownups
want to eat us.

29:38.643 --> 29:40.110
We open that door,

29:40.111 --> 29:41.945
we get an angry PTA meeting
swarming in here.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.648
I need options
for taking out that nest.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.650
There's still some fuel
in the tanks underneath us.

29:46.651 --> 29:48.485
They didn't use it all
in the self-destruct.

29:48.486 --> 29:49.820
I could rig
a secondary detonation.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.355
Assuming we could get past
the killer bugs

29:51.356 --> 29:52.823
right outside the door.

29:52.824 --> 29:54.725
I'm sorry, but aren't
we being hasty here?

29:54.726 --> 29:56.093
If that nest hatches,

29:56.094 --> 29:58.562
those creature will burrow
over a massive radius,

29:58.563 --> 29:59.730
lay new eggs,

29:59.731 --> 30:01.398
and destroy
the entire continent!

30:01.399 --> 30:02.866
What about containment?

30:02.867 --> 30:04.935
Well, we're not
equipped for that, are we?

30:06.404 --> 30:07.871
Nikola...

30:07.872 --> 30:10.407
These creatures are not
naturally evolved.

30:10.408 --> 30:11.742
They're abominations

30:11.743 --> 30:13.410
caused by the Cabal's
recklessness!

30:13.411 --> 30:14.978
Hold on a second,

30:14.979 --> 30:16.513
since when are you
the defender

30:16.514 --> 30:17.781
of the abnormal
community anyway?

30:17.782 --> 30:18.849
I'm a scientist--

30:18.850 --> 30:20.917
stop insulting us!

30:20.918 --> 30:22.519
We know exactly why
you want them alive.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.920
If I could
just extract

30:23.921 --> 30:26.757
a small amount of plasma
from just one of the pupae,

30:26.758 --> 30:28.492
9 can create a serum

30:28.493 --> 30:31.528
that would replicate the effects
of the original source blood.

30:31.529 --> 30:33.497
Hey, you could become
a vampire again.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.865
Dude, did you not
see "the fly?"

30:34.866 --> 30:35.866
You could become
half-vampire,

30:35.867 --> 30:36.900
half-centipede.

30:36.901 --> 30:37.734
That is a really
bad idea--

30:37.735 --> 30:38.869
I can figure it out!

30:38.870 --> 30:41.805
Which is exactly why
we are going to destroy

30:41.806 --> 30:44.408
every trace of these creatures.

30:44.409 --> 30:46.643
I will not see another Cabal,

30:46.644 --> 30:48.111
another Lazarus virus,

30:48.112 --> 30:49.813
another Ashley created

30:49.814 --> 30:51.081
in pursuit of source blood.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.417
We blow the nest,

30:53.418 --> 30:54.551
and if you interfere,

30:54.552 --> 30:55.819
you with it.

31:10.935 --> 31:12.135
He better not run.

31:12.136 --> 31:13.103
He won't.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.039
I hate it
when they run.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.041
He won't run.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.177
Come on, O'Farrell.

31:20.178 --> 31:21.645
You got the tip.

31:21.646 --> 31:22.712
You know he's been spotted,
come and get him.

31:22.713 --> 31:24.581
Kate...

31:24.582 --> 31:26.183
Relax.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.929
This is it.

31:43.034 --> 31:44.668
Hands. Now!

31:44.669 --> 31:45.635
Hey, you got me.

31:45.636 --> 31:47.504
You got me, you got me...

31:47.505 --> 31:49.639
All right,
down.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.008
On the ground.

31:52.009 --> 31:52.943
Whoa, whoa,
what did I do?

31:52.944 --> 31:53.944
You shut up.

31:53.945 --> 31:54.945
Don't move.

31:54.946 --> 31:56.012
Hey, now,

31:56.013 --> 31:57.581
what are you doing?

31:57.582 --> 31:58.515
Just arrest me.

31:58.516 --> 31:59.683
I'm not resisting.

32:01.519 --> 32:02.919
Yeah, you are.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.154
No, really.

32:04.155 --> 32:05.555
I got a right
to remain silent.

32:05.556 --> 32:07.124
I have the right
to an attorney...

32:07.125 --> 32:08.492
Come on, let's do this.

32:08.493 --> 32:11.761
Shut up. Shut up!

32:14.832 --> 32:16.199
What are you doing?

32:16.200 --> 32:17.501
I'm sorry, kid.

32:18.836 --> 32:20.203
Nothing personal.

32:33.684 --> 32:35.986
You okay?

32:35.987 --> 32:38.288
You don't know
what you've done.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.289
You don't know anything.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.025
You killed
father j!

32:42.026 --> 32:43.660
Why?

32:43.661 --> 32:44.628
I had to!

32:44.629 --> 32:45.962
You think
I had a choice?

32:47.965 --> 32:49.699
I know who you are.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.168
What you do.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.702
Let us help you.

32:52.703 --> 32:54.638
No, you can't.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.206
I did what
I had to do.

32:57.642 --> 33:01.244
What he made me do.

33:09.086 --> 33:10.187
You don't understand.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.656
This is bigger
than us.

33:12.657 --> 33:16.359
It's over.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.761
He got everything he wanted.

33:18.863 --> 33:20.597
Who?

33:22.567 --> 33:23.400
Who?

33:27.738 --> 33:31.241
Oh, God, no, please...

33:31.242 --> 33:33.677
No, God, please, no!

33:33.678 --> 33:35.745
Please don't...

33:35.746 --> 33:38.081
Oh, God...

33:38.082 --> 33:39.182
Stop!

33:48.593 --> 33:50.994
Oh, my God.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.972
Okay, charges
are set.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.607
It's going to be
a big boom.

34:03.608 --> 34:04.608
Once I push
this trigger,

34:04.609 --> 34:05.842
we're gonna want to
run like hell.

34:05.843 --> 34:08.812
Okay, this whole area is
gonna be a giant inferno.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.746
You're absolutely
99 determined to do th?

34:10.748 --> 34:12.282
Let's get out of here.

34:12.283 --> 34:13.717
All right,
this trigger has

34:13.717 --> 34:15.018
a 60-second delay.

34:15.018 --> 34:16.186
I can't set it
further from this

34:16.187 --> 34:17.387
because of the interference
from these walls.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.723
60 seconds?

34:19.724 --> 34:20.790
I just rigged
something up

34:20.791 --> 34:22.058
from one of these
old centrifuges, okay?

34:22.059 --> 34:23.393
It's the best
I can give us.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.328
Then let's be fast.

34:25.329 --> 34:26.663
Gentlemen, pick your targets.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.398
Nikola, you're last one
out to seal them door.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.666
Ready?

34:29.667 --> 34:31.067
You kidding?
I can't wait.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.371
Do it.

34:44.047 --> 34:45.882
Uh...

34:45.882 --> 34:47.016
Good.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.284
Wait until they're
in the nest

34:48.286 --> 34:49.619
before we
set the charge.

34:52.857 --> 34:53.857
Henry!

34:59.664 --> 35:01.197
Nikola, come on!

35:06.203 --> 35:07.937
Why are they
coming after us?

35:09.707 --> 35:11.241
They don't want us!

35:11.242 --> 35:14.010
They want me!

35:20.649 --> 35:21.682
Magnus!

35:23.985 --> 35:25.052
It's no use, Helen.

35:25.053 --> 35:26.620
Nikola!

35:27.856 --> 35:29.457
You always did have
more appeal than me.

35:35.831 --> 35:36.997
There you are,
my pretties.

35:36.998 --> 35:38.966
Yeah, you like that? Huh?

35:38.967 --> 35:41.736
Finest vintage!

35:43.371 --> 35:44.638
Speak well of me.

35:44.639 --> 35:45.473
Nikola, no!

35:49.444 --> 35:50.511
12 seconds.

35:50.512 --> 35:51.512
Magnus,
we gotta move!

35:51.513 --> 35:52.546
Come on!

35:52.547 --> 35:53.848
Dammit!

35:59.855 --> 36:01.422
Never bore your audience.

36:21.943 --> 36:24.445
Magnus...

36:24.446 --> 36:26.714
It's all right, will.

36:26.715 --> 36:28.516
You have to admit,

36:28.517 --> 36:30.751
that's a hell
of an exit.

36:30.752 --> 36:32.887
Indeed.

37:06.822 --> 37:09.056
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

37:09.057 --> 37:10.758
Start digging.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.708
Nikola.

37:27.709 --> 37:29.643
Rocking
the magna-power!

37:29.644 --> 37:32.813
Fortunately, I can't hear
what any of you are saying!

37:32.814 --> 37:35.850
It's very nice!

37:35.851 --> 37:36.917
That's quite the parlor trick.

37:36.918 --> 37:38.552
I guess
this magnetic power

37:38.553 --> 37:39.820
has potential
after all.

37:39.821 --> 37:40.955
Yeah, well,
you know what they say, right?

37:40.956 --> 37:43.557
It's not what you have,
it's how you use it.

37:43.558 --> 37:45.693
Ah...

37:50.932 --> 37:52.099
Oh, good, we're going to
make it home

37:52.100 --> 37:53.701
in time for lunch.

37:53.702 --> 37:54.835
Best news I've
had all night.

37:54.836 --> 37:56.437
This calls
for a toast.

37:56.438 --> 37:57.738
I can't believe

37:57.739 --> 37:59.240
you set off
on a rescue mission

37:59.241 --> 38:01.442
and didn't bring any
decent libations with you.

38:01.443 --> 38:02.843
What are we,
Saint Bernards?

38:02.844 --> 38:04.478
To our lost
brothers in blood.

38:04.479 --> 38:07.581
May we never see
their like again.

38:07.582 --> 38:10.451
Slimy perversions
of science be damned.

38:10.452 --> 38:11.452
Hey, Henry,

38:11.453 --> 38:13.988
I'll show you a shortcut.

38:13.989 --> 38:15.122
He kept one of
the larvae, didn't he?

38:15.123 --> 38:17.091
Oh, definitely.

38:17.092 --> 38:18.192
You going to let him
get away with it?

38:18.193 --> 38:19.460
No...

38:19.461 --> 38:20.227
But let him
enjoy his moment.

38:21.196 --> 38:23.597
Every time.

38:37.746 --> 38:41.448
It's certainly
a nice view, isn't it?

38:41.449 --> 38:42.583
Didn't mean
to startle you.

38:44.686 --> 38:45.753
I'm father Clark.

38:45.754 --> 38:49.723
You were there
with the police.

38:49.724 --> 38:51.759
Before he died,

38:51.760 --> 38:54.929
father Jensen
and I corresponded.

38:54.930 --> 38:57.831
He told me many things
about this parish,

38:57.832 --> 38:59.867
about those he helped here,

38:59.868 --> 39:00.868
and why.

39:03.238 --> 39:05.072
Your loss must be...

39:05.073 --> 39:06.473
Very painful.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.580
If you want,

39:13.581 --> 39:14.982
I'm here to listen

39:14.983 --> 39:18.552
to whatever
you have to say.

39:23.892 --> 39:27.594
He was important.

39:29.564 --> 39:32.800
He listened

39:32.801 --> 39:34.601
when no one else would hear.

39:36.237 --> 39:38.005
Judged your soul,

39:38.006 --> 39:39.139
not your appearance.

39:52.253 --> 39:55.789
He was a dear friend,
wasn't he?

39:55.790 --> 39:58.192
Where I come from,

39:58.193 --> 40:01.128
one who saves a life

40:01.129 --> 40:02.763
becomes a brother.

40:02.764 --> 40:07.868
And when your... kind

40:07.869 --> 40:09.636
loses a brother?

40:16.144 --> 40:20.014
Part of us dies with him.

40:26.154 --> 40:29.623
There have been
too many deaths lately.

40:29.624 --> 40:31.125
So much loss
to contend with.

40:31.126 --> 40:34.094
My heart just...

40:34.095 --> 40:36.663
Breaks.

40:38.833 --> 40:42.736
Thank you for sharing
your pain with me.

40:42.737 --> 40:46.073
I hope we see each other again

40:46.074 --> 40:47.307
very soon.

41:07.195 --> 41:10.831
There you are.

41:10.832 --> 41:12.900
Do you mind?

41:25.980 --> 41:28.615
I am so sorry, old friend.

41:28.616 --> 41:31.885
It makes no sense.

41:31.886 --> 41:33.720
I agree.

41:33.721 --> 41:35.022
I went through

41:35.023 --> 41:37.825
Detective O'Farrell's
autopsy results.

41:37.826 --> 41:39.626
He was entirely human.

41:39.627 --> 41:43.030
No evidence of any drugs
or undue influence.

41:43.031 --> 41:45.232
The man died
of a brain aneurysm,

41:45.233 --> 41:46.867
plain and simple.

41:46.868 --> 41:50.938
Something made him kill.

41:50.939 --> 41:52.005
Someone.

41:52.006 --> 41:53.841
Will spoke to
some of his contacts

41:53.842 --> 41:57.077
at the police department.

41:57.078 --> 42:00.848
O'Farrell's family
were being held prisoner.

42:00.849 --> 42:01.882
They were found
this morning

42:01.883 --> 42:02.916
after an anonymous tip

42:02.917 --> 42:04.751
led the police
to their location.

42:04.752 --> 42:07.855
They were unharmed,

42:07.856 --> 42:12.025
but their lives are-
are destroyed.

42:12.026 --> 42:16.363
O'Farrell,
he said he had no choice.

42:16.364 --> 42:17.664
Of course he didn't.

42:17.665 --> 42:19.366
He was being coerced.

42:21.970 --> 42:24.271
By whom?
