01:38.919 --> 01:40.748
You're not getting away with this.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.300
- Palmer, you asshole... Hey!
- Yeah. Oops.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.740
- Stop. You meant to do that.
- Did that just happen?

01:46.840 --> 01:49.460
- No, you startled me.
- Yeah, you meant to do that.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.662
No, I don't think I did.

01:52.040 --> 01:56.260
Listen, this wasn't some West Englewood
drug sweep. The search was good.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.060
There's no chance Carter tosses it.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.740
Calm down. That's why they
call it an evidentiary hearing.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.940
What, so you can smear me?
Imply that I invented a phantom witness?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.660
- Did you?
- The jaded lawyer...

02:05.760 --> 02:08.060
with no respect for the law.
That's original.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.259
That's me?

02:09.360 --> 02:13.380
I respect the law just fine. I'm just not
in awe of it. I'm not encumbered by it.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.620
If the great state of Illinois
can't meet its burden of proof...

02:16.720 --> 02:19.820
if I walk with a
guilty client, it's on you.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.460
So I suggest you do your job, Kattan.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.220
Now, if you'd like to finish that clichÃ© you
followed me into the pisser to unload...

02:27.320 --> 02:30.822
Did it involve my reflection?
Maybe sleeping at night, how do I do it?

02:32.680 --> 02:35.740
I do it on a Tempur-Pedic bed,
in a Highland Park home...

02:35.840 --> 02:38.300
with a Ferrari, next to a loving wife...

02:38.400 --> 02:40.662
with the ass of a
high-school volleyballer.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.140
And how does it feel, Hank?

02:44.240 --> 02:47.184
Knowing every person you represent
is guilty?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.345
It's fine.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.430
Innocent people can't afford me.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.340
Pop.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.349
Burden of proof, Kattan.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.580
Wait, wait, wait.
You said this wouldn't go to trial.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.180
I'm sorry, did I say that?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.180
I hired you to make this go away.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.500
Wrong.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.340
You hired me because we know you wouldn't
last two days in a federal penitentiary.

03:08.440 --> 03:12.340
Stop telling me how to do my job.
Do I tell you how to commit fraud...

03:12.440 --> 03:14.860
deny coverage
to terminally ill policy holders...

03:14.960 --> 03:17.580
or embezzle 140 million dollars
while you're at it?

03:17.680 --> 03:21.705
I wouldn't do that, because that's your gig.
That's your forte.

03:22.480 --> 03:23.860
- I'm hearing you.
- I'm glad.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.029
All rise.

03:33.720 --> 03:37.541
Court is in session. The Honorable
Judge Stanley Carter presiding.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.425
Be seated.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.380
Before I rule on the defense motion, is there
anything either counsel would care to add?

03:44.480 --> 03:46.260
Yes, Your Honor.

03:46.360 --> 03:50.020
We would like to remove any doubt
as to the validity of our search.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.791
Your Honor, can I...

03:53.640 --> 03:55.469
approach, Your Honor?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.340
I need a continuance.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.305
Absolutely not.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.660
My mom passed away this morning.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.220
My ass.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.625
I'll replay it.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.700
Is this the first time
your mom passed away...

04:20.800 --> 04:23.744
or is it something you do
on all cases you're about to lose?

04:25.680 --> 04:27.180
I'm sorry for your loss.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.589
Thank you. First time.
What a schmuck you are.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.100
You know, he peed on me.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.580
Just now, in the restroom down the hall.
He turned around and...

04:38.680 --> 04:40.020
Mr. Kattan, step away.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.660
Daddy, are you sad about your mom?

04:42.760 --> 04:45.227
Yeah, baby. I wish you'd met her.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.820
Why can't I go with you?

04:48.920 --> 04:51.990
Because it's depressing.
You don't wanna go.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.420
So Grandpa Palmer's dead too?

04:55.520 --> 04:59.780
No, Grandpa Palmer's dead to me.
That's like a figure of speech.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.540
You might have misheard
something I said.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.460
Sounds complicated.
I should go with you.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.340
Trust me, nobody wants to
go to Carlinville, Indiana.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.668
Everybody wants to leave.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.180
You looking for something?

05:20.280 --> 05:23.031
- You got my Bit O'Honey, old man?
- Check it out.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.506
I love you, baby.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.861
Don't eat it before breakfast.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.022
Got you.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.149
Is there something I can do?

05:43.240 --> 05:45.300
They're my in-laws.
I feel like we should...

05:45.400 --> 05:48.500
Lou Shrubner.
That's your divorce attorney?

05:48.600 --> 05:50.350
He's good.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.020
She'll be living with me, by the way.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.710
Hank.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.900
Hank!

05:59.320 --> 06:01.340
What time does school
start in the morning?

06:01.440 --> 06:02.660
What's her teacher's name?

06:02.760 --> 06:05.260
Brownie meetings are
which night? Soccer?

06:05.360 --> 06:06.820
What's her favorite color?

06:06.920 --> 06:09.260
Who's her best friend?
What does she eat for breakfast?

06:09.360 --> 06:13.260
Do you even know her pediatrician's name?
His phone number? You got that on you?

06:13.360 --> 06:17.260
I'm not gonna let you punish her
for this, okay? She understands.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.180
She knows it's not right that her daddy's
never home before her bedtime.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.020
He's always on his phone.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.620
She knows it's not right
that her mom is sad all the time.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.540
- Sad? You're sad?
- Yes!

06:28.640 --> 06:31.380
I'm sorry you felt so sad
you got on Facebook...

06:31.480 --> 06:35.420
friended your old Gore-Tex-wearing
college buddy Josh and fucked him.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.420
He's so rugged. He's so wise.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.624
I don't know why you're not hanging off
a mountain with him right now.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.820
Wanna do something for me?

06:49.920 --> 06:52.421
Water the fucking hydrangeas.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.149
Thank you.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.430
Brr. Oh, God, here we go.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.861
Nothing changes.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.621
Hey, Hank.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.625
Hey, Dale.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.587
Missed you.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.225
Her heart just kind of turned off.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.660
I found her by the hydrangeas.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.225
Good job.

10:34.040 --> 10:39.300
Oh. This is St. Francis. I picked.
Because he was her favorite.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.380
Friend to the birds, like Mom. Oh.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.660
Gotta remember to put food out for them,
especially in the winter.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.468
He's gentle, like Mom used to be.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.109
Ran the snakes out of Indiana,
and don't ask me how.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.740
Ireland. Out of Ireland?

10:56.840 --> 10:59.820
Snakes are your constant,
but St. Patrick, not St. Francis...

10:59.920 --> 11:01.624
and it was Ireland, not Indiana.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.582
Trust me, no one's dispersing reptiles
in Indiana.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.149
- Were you there?
- I was not there.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.700
Maybe you're right.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.340
Hank Palmer in Carlinville.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.180
There he is.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.144
The cardinal is the state bird and...

11:21.600 --> 11:24.340
- Hey.
- Hey, Glen.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.861
I just saw you a few minutes ago.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.985
Where'd you park?

11:31.280 --> 11:34.031
- I'm on the street.
- I'm parked up...

11:34.960 --> 11:38.180
Tried to get a space in the big lot.
I had to go around.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.906
- But eventually I found one.
- Here you go.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.780
- Where's the family?
- Couldn't make it. School.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.700
Oh. I didn't know kids in Chicago
go to school in the summer.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.540
There isn't. They just do...
They got... I'm alone.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.860
What's the story?

11:52.960 --> 11:55.540
There is no story.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.620
Do you have anything else to say
for yourself, Mr. Williams?

12:23.720 --> 12:27.427
Anything that would enlighten us
concerning your situation?

12:28.480 --> 12:29.980
What do you wanna hear?

12:30.080 --> 12:31.750
You know, nobody's hiring.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.026
You can't get spinach out of a turnip.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.500
I can't afford to pay child support.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.740
You can't?

12:38.840 --> 12:42.626
That your new truck out front?

12:43.360 --> 12:44.791
Which one?

12:45.960 --> 12:48.660
- Yeah.
- "'Yeah' is not an affirmation..."

12:48.760 --> 12:52.148
"Yeah" is not an affirmation
a man uses in court.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.226
- Yes, sir... Judge, Your Honor.
- Keys.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.701
Go on. Pitch them.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.384
And...

13:12.680 --> 13:15.980
- Augustus, judge.
- Yeah, of course. Gus.

13:17.560 --> 13:21.100
Would you give those
to Mr. Williams' ex-wife, please?

13:21.200 --> 13:25.060
Then escort Mr. Williams
to his ex-truck.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.069
You're gonna sign that over to her.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.620
And you, ma'am, are gonna go down
to DeVaney Motors...

13:30.720 --> 13:34.900
ask for Mike DeVaney, the father,
not the nitwit son...

13:35.000 --> 13:37.420
and sell your new truck back to him...

13:37.520 --> 13:40.180
for whatever the turnip there
put down on it.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.509
- This ain't fair...
- Hey! One more word. Go on.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.100
Look around you.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.460
You're standing in one of the last
great cathedrals in this country...

13:49.560 --> 13:52.980
built on the premise that you
and you alone are responsible...

13:53.080 --> 13:56.620
for the consequences of your actions.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.980
Now, you still want fair? All right.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.500
Head north.
Stop when you get to Indianapolis.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.420
Tractor pulls, cotton candy...

14:04.520 --> 14:08.740
kettle corn and the
world's largest steer.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.260
First week in August. You'll love it.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.384
Oh, I forgot. Wait, wait, wait.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.460
You don't have a truck.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.860
Thank you very much, judge.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.260
Want me to tell you what
causes that, ma'am?

14:45.680 --> 14:48.620
Thank you, fellas.
Appreciate you all being here.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.046
But who's out guarding
the doughnut shop?

14:51.800 --> 14:54.220
- She was a good woman, Joseph.
- Yes, she was.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.300
Grace and I are here
if you need anything.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.741
Thank you so much. Thank you.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.100
- We all loved Mary.
- Thank you. It means a lot to me.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.940
Sorry for your loss.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.540
Good friends, always.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.540
- Good to see you, sir.
- Chief. Good man. Hey.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.060
Thanks for coming. Appreciate it.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.867
Yeah. Whole force out, huh?

15:22.360 --> 15:23.660
Henry.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.862
- Judge.
- Yeah.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.420
Hey...

15:28.520 --> 15:30.941
- Oh, Johnny Boy. Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.870
- Joseph.
- Yeah. Thank you, Rose.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.260
I'm gonna shower up and hit the rack.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.780
Glen, make sure you hold
your boys together tomorrow.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.506
We don't want a lot of caterwauling.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.420
- Will do, judge.
- Yeah.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.060
I get it's been a while, Hank...

16:12.160 --> 16:17.140
but backing a car into a driveway to
make getting out easier is a concept...

16:17.240 --> 16:19.140
- ...not dulled by time.
- Thank you.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.540
- Right?
- Got it.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.186
Be my guest. Please.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.300
- How you doing?
- I had to water the plants.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.468
You gonna be okay at
the funeral tomorrow?

16:28.920 --> 16:33.460
Yeah. That camera makes an appearance,
we both know where it's heading, right?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.740
Up my ass.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.351
Good man.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.429
Tough day.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.420
Yep.

16:42.520 --> 16:46.306
At the wake, he shakes my hand
while he's hugging everyone else.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.347
This family's a fucking
Picasso painting.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.711
Your room has all Dad's important stuff.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.227
- It's crazy. I mean...
- Oh!

17:22.640 --> 17:25.310
- Magic 8-Ball.
- It is certain.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.660
We know it's wrong

17:37.760 --> 17:43.060
To let this fire burn between us

17:43.160 --> 17:45.500
Hey, Hank. Want some breakfast?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.380
Better hustle if you do.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.660
"Hey, Hank, going to breakfast
at the diner. Care to join?"

17:50.760 --> 17:52.060
"Okay, when?" "Right now."

17:52.160 --> 17:55.420
"Oh, yeah. Can I throw on some pants?"
"Sure. You're a family member."

17:55.520 --> 17:57.380
Any of that sound reasonable?

17:57.480 --> 17:59.580
Coming here every Saturday
for the last 35...

17:59.680 --> 18:02.101
- Oh, I forgot, today's about you.
- Coffee.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.225
Let's go.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.180
We're two people caught up in the flame

18:09.280 --> 18:11.064
We'll see you there, Hank.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.260
I'll be right along.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.940
I didn't mean to start this fire

18:17.040 --> 18:20.906
And neither did you

18:22.200 --> 18:24.109
Still letting him wind you up?

18:26.520 --> 18:28.110
Sam.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.220
And we'll sweep out the ashes

18:31.320 --> 18:33.582
- Henry.
- HANK:

18:34.440 --> 18:36.144
I'm surprised you still work here.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.220
In a good way.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.420
In the way that people are surprised
when somebody you know is...

18:42.520 --> 18:44.987
You discover they've
had the same job for...

18:45.680 --> 18:47.420
20 years... Stop it.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.622
You kept your hair.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.940
Like sawing sawdust,
all that worry for nothing.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.460
Any other fears come true?

18:55.560 --> 18:57.788
Yes. Just now.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.108
Old girlfriends, seeing them.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.271
Stop staring. I know I look good.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.860
I'm sorry about your mom.

19:11.960 --> 19:16.065
She and I stayed close.
Gee, I just saw her Tuesday.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.027
Mysterious ways.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.100
I'm assuming you still know
where the cemetery is?

19:24.200 --> 19:25.900
You're invited. Of course you are.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.540
- Wolf it. You gotta go.
- Surprised I am.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.105
See you there.

20:05.560 --> 20:07.580
You've always been my sweetheart...

20:07.680 --> 20:09.225
and you always will be.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.029
I want you to know that.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.789
I'll be back tomorrow.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.504
And every day after that.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.864
Bye. Bye-bye.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.740
- Come on, Joe, give your brother a break.
- Hank's feet are on the couch.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.260
Indeed.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.580
Hey, Glen, my nephews
still playing ball?

20:56.680 --> 20:58.740
Think either of them
could ever be as good as you?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.060
Yes.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.900
Yes, Joe is hitting cleanup on varsity.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.260
Eric wouldn't know a baseball if you
threw it at him and it hit him in the head.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.500
Anyway, for what it's worth?

21:11.600 --> 21:13.420
None of my business...

21:13.520 --> 21:16.100
Keep an eye on the judge.
I think he's...

21:16.920 --> 21:18.020
He's drinking.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.820
Are you crazy?
Dad has been sober for 28 years.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.740
I was at the courthouse.
He forgot Gus's name.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.988
Gus? Gus the bailiff.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.420
Oh, come on.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.020
Just saying.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.940
That's bullshit.
What time is your flight tomorrow?

21:34.040 --> 21:36.427
Eight-fifteen. Can't wait.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.226
First flight out.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.064
Make yourself at home there, Henry.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.060
I'm going for groceries.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.420
- Should Glen drive you?
- I don't know, Dale.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.351
Does being widowed make me
a lousy goddamn driver?

21:53.280 --> 21:55.460
Hank, if I don't see you before you...

21:55.560 --> 21:58.140
Before you leave...

21:58.240 --> 21:59.785
thanks for coming.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.031
I'm sure your mother
would have appreciated it.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.660
- Honey, we're gonna go to Firefly for a drink.
- No.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.180
- Come on.
- I'm gonna go to bed.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.460
- No. Drink.
- Okay.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.185
- Dale, you coming?
- You coming?

22:25.040 --> 22:28.220
Hank, he threw things at us
to get our attention, not to draw blood.

22:28.320 --> 22:29.660
- You know that, right?
- No.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.660
He issued canine commands
to get our attention.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.828
He hurled periodicals for sport.

22:34.600 --> 22:39.180
Please, with all the trouble you made,
you're lucky that's all you got.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.220
Hey, thanks for showing up, Carla.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.991
Yeah, I know I'm late, Billy. So sue me.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.580
- Go give some grown-ups drinks, please.
- Oh.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.700
He was tough, but, aw, come on,
it wasn't that bad.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.020
- Remember fishing?
- I remember the lake house.

22:53.120 --> 22:56.460
Yeah, that's right.
He used to tell us all to be quiet.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.940
"You're scaring the fish away."

23:00.240 --> 23:03.580
And he still goes there every Wednesday
to play chess with Doc Morris.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.780
He loves that place.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.062
Hey, don't I know you?

23:07.400 --> 23:10.180
Don't you run the tire-and-rim shop
over on State?

23:10.280 --> 23:11.905
- That's right.
- Palmer?

23:13.280 --> 23:14.860
I know you too.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.180
You're the little dimwit
shutterbug retard...

23:17.280 --> 23:19.860
always with the shitty old movie camera.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.700
Easy.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.709
Judge Palmer's your old man?

23:25.640 --> 23:29.220
He thinks he runs this town, don't he?

23:29.320 --> 23:31.070
Your dad's a piece of shit.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.980
Wait, wait, no, no.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.220
- You know what? I told you to take it easy.
- Come on, motherfucker!

23:36.320 --> 23:38.502
Who's on probation? Who's on parole?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.060
You guys have a low opinion
of Judge Palmer?

23:41.160 --> 23:45.180
When your field officer's filling out his
incident report, I'm gonna be very helpful.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.660
So let me guess.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.540
Who's got the felony DWI?

23:48.640 --> 23:50.060
Oh, you flinched.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.100
Possession of a controlled substance?
Domestic violence? That's you.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.500
You all right, honey?

23:55.600 --> 24:00.540
What other myriad of misdemeanors is gonna
come to light while you're in the slammer?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.740
Failure to appear?
Bench warrants? Come on.

24:02.840 --> 24:06.660
And because I'm the only one that isn't
driving with a suspended license...

24:06.760 --> 24:10.060
I'll be driving your gals home,
so who lives closer?

24:10.160 --> 24:12.780
Bad skin muffin-top
or Red Bull semen breath?

24:14.200 --> 24:16.302
- Asshole!
- Throw that punch. You like County food?

24:21.200 --> 24:25.940
Maybe just my closed fist, counselor,
in my own personal space.

24:26.040 --> 24:29.580
And maybe I was gonna ask you
to blow on my dice.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.740
That's a metaphor.
I heard it. It's good. You're funny.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.060
Let's get the hell out of here.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.750
Get some counseling.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.627
Dershowitz?

24:48.080 --> 24:49.625
Come here.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.065
Yes?

24:55.560 --> 24:59.140
Why don't you read my beads?

24:59.240 --> 25:00.900
Maybe I'll buy you a drink.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.820
Punctuality issues,
equal confidence in bloom...

25:03.920 --> 25:06.980
strong teeth, incestry gene pool...

25:07.080 --> 25:10.946
and I'm guessing the wetter you get,
the better you look. You'll go far.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.780
What are you having?

25:16.120 --> 25:17.380
Last call, boys.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.780
You're done.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.940
- Are you watching for me?
- What do you think?

25:38.040 --> 25:39.540
- I'm your eyes.
- All right.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.540
- Straight.
- You smell like her. She smells nice.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.860
What is that?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.940
It's Play-Doh. Are you paying attention?

25:46.040 --> 25:49.700
Straighten it out. Back, back, back.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.062
Easy. Nice, nice. Stop!

25:56.800 --> 25:58.180
You did that on purpose.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.906
- No, I don't...
- You did it on purpose.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.020
You bang it out yourself.
Dale, let's go.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.346
Let's go.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.460
What the hell did he hit?

27:00.560 --> 27:03.231
I was thinking a six-pack.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.940
Goddamn it!

27:06.040 --> 27:08.940
Which one of you peckerwoods
banged up my car?

27:09.040 --> 27:11.260
- Answer me. Who did this?
- Who do you think?

27:11.360 --> 27:12.860
- Who?
- Who drove last?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.983
We saw you leave for the grocery store.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.300
Glen? Where are your boys?

27:19.400 --> 27:22.140
Oh. Dad, they wouldn't drive your car.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.
Don't let him pretend this is complicated.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.540
There's no reasonable doubt here.
He's human.

27:27.640 --> 27:31.620
His wife died, he fell off the wagon,
banged up the Caddy.

27:31.720 --> 27:35.460
- Deal. Shit happens.
- Like your marriage.

27:35.560 --> 27:37.420
- What do you know?
- I know a lot.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.420
- You don't know a thing...
- I know a lot.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.420
She was my wife
long before she was your mother.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.820
We kept no secrets.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.864
You tell your brothers you're
getting a divorce? Tell them!

27:48.440 --> 27:50.260
Lisa...

27:50.360 --> 27:53.543
played Hide the Pickle
with someone else.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.460
- I won't be back.
- Yeah.

27:57.560 --> 27:58.820
Happy trails!

27:58.920 --> 28:01.705
- I'll never fucking come back here again.
- Good!

28:16.080 --> 28:17.340
Attention, passengers.

28:17.440 --> 28:22.228
We request at this time that you
turn off all electronic devices.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.540
Make it quick.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.340
Don't get on the plane.
I need you back. Dad's...

29:00.440 --> 29:03.060
- I don't care. You're on your own.
- Stop talking and listen!

29:03.160 --> 29:05.900
- I gotta turn off the phone.
- Just shut up for a second!

29:06.000 --> 29:09.229
Shut your mouth and listen
for once in your entire life!

29:12.440 --> 29:14.860
- What is it, Glen?
- Sheriff...

29:14.960 --> 29:18.020
Sheriff White called Dad
down to the police station.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.060
They're asking questions about the car.
They think that he...

29:21.160 --> 29:24.500
I don't wanna hear it. Unless he
killed somebody, you're on your own.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.623
They found a body, Hank.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.420
"You mean, judge, I can milk her,
kill her, cook her...

29:32.520 --> 29:34.660
eat her, even, but that's illegal?"

29:36.600 --> 29:38.780
True story.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.268
- Mr. Palmer...
- Judge Palmer, Deputy Hanson.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.700
Sir, did anybody other than you
have access to your vehicle?

29:45.800 --> 29:47.780
- No, sir.
- You gotta be shitting me.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.620
Is this an interview?

29:49.720 --> 29:52.460
We've got a witness that puts his car
on Route 30...

29:52.560 --> 29:55.860
heading towards Shelby Road
at the approximate time of the accident.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.940
Oh, boy. But that's not enough
to put his car at the scene.

29:59.040 --> 30:02.740
Any strip-mall lawyer's gonna chew
that up and spit it out. Stolen vehicle.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.700
- You need him behind the wheel.
- Hank, let's go, pal.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.740
Go where?
Whoa, Both-Ways Bobby, graduation night.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.860
The quarry, your Ranchero.
I remember everything.

30:11.960 --> 30:15.140
You and Kevin Thompson
in the backseat naked, huffing whippets.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.627
Shall I continue? I can elaborate.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.500
It's just a rumor.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.384
Where were we?

30:22.360 --> 30:24.740
He's been on the bench too long.
He forgets:

30:24.840 --> 30:27.060
"if you don't talk, you walk."

30:27.160 --> 30:30.220
We don't hide behind the law here.
There's damage to my car.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.980
I went to the convenience
store last night, all right?

30:33.080 --> 30:35.780
Every word limits his options.
Keep going.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.540
Imagine a faraway place, Hank...

30:38.640 --> 30:41.500
where people value your opinion.
Now go there.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.500
What about booze?

30:43.600 --> 30:46.100
Eighty percent of
hit-and-runs involve liquor.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.541
His wife just died.
Why wouldn't he take a swig?

30:49.240 --> 30:51.820
But you need an admission from him.

30:51.920 --> 30:56.020
Better yet, a voluntary urine sample.
There you go.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.665
Fill her up.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.140
A bladder full of courtesy coffee...

31:00.240 --> 31:02.940
and a "since you're in the john anyway"
sort of thing?

31:03.040 --> 31:04.420
Might catch him off guard.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.226
We can get everything we need
from a hair sample.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.140
Sure can. Nice work, sheriff.

31:12.240 --> 31:16.180
You should be proud of yourself.
Be halfway to manslaughter by lunch.

31:16.280 --> 31:21.307
Judge Palmer, we're gonna
need to impound your vehicle.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.380
- Tell me what happened.
- I don't remember.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.140
- Because you were drunk?
- No, because I can't remember.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.020
Don't you think I wanna remember?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.860
For all I know,
I never hit anything or anybody!

31:33.960 --> 31:35.660
So I was in the liquor cabinet.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.420
What kind of recovering alcoholic
keeps a stocked liquor cabinet?

31:38.520 --> 31:43.660
No, "recovered." it's a reminder that
I'm stronger. It holds no power over me.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.220
Right now that cop Hanson's
on his way to the mini-mart...

31:48.520 --> 31:52.140
...to ask some scared-shitless high-school
clerk with half a joint in his front pocket...

31:52.240 --> 31:54.860
if you had the odor of alcohol
on your breath.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.060
- Did you?
- No.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.060
- Bloodshot eyes?
- No.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.820
- Slurred speech?
- No!

32:11.000 --> 32:13.307
They shouldn't drive together.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.060
I'm on your side, judge.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.100
And if this goes south, and it might...

32:19.200 --> 32:23.180
you need to say with a straight face that
you haven't had a drink in 28 years.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.580
What's done is done. If you hit somebody,
they swerved in front of you.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.500
I strongly suggest you dry out
and practice that narrative.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.384
Narrate this.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.660
We're gonna have to file
another continuance. What else can I do?

32:41.760 --> 32:45.420
Trust me, I'm gonna be back fast
as I can. It's a personal matter.

32:45.520 --> 32:48.260
Yeah, I'd love to walk out
on it, but I can't.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.944
Karen, hold on.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.667
Why the hell are you calling me, Lisa?

32:57.200 --> 32:58.904
Lauren.

32:59.640 --> 33:02.425
Hi, honey.
What are you doing with Mommy's phone?

33:03.240 --> 33:06.380
No, no, don't worry about it. What's up?

33:06.480 --> 33:08.900
I miss you too. Baby, I'll see you soon.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.300
Either I'll come home,
or maybe you'll come here.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.180
Look, we'll figure it out, don't worry.
I promise.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.580
I'll take you shopping.
You wanna go shopping?

33:17.680 --> 33:21.182
Want a cell phone? All your own?
I'll get you a...

33:21.480 --> 33:23.300
Daddy has to work.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.820
- Yeah.
- Hank...

33:24.920 --> 33:27.864
Forensics found traces of blood
on your dad's car.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.100
- So?
- Deep in the grill.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.383
- Great.
- It matches the victim.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.180
- I'm sorry.
- It's murder two.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.740
Murder?

33:37.840 --> 33:39.500
So are you a clairvoyant?

33:39.600 --> 33:42.180
- That's not the whole of it.
- Or is he out of his mind?

33:42.280 --> 33:44.020
That's a rookie move. Careful.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.340
Victim is Mark Blackwell.

33:47.440 --> 33:51.989
Pretty amazing coincidence,
don't you think? Blackwell?

34:34.600 --> 34:36.668
You killed him.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.900
- Oh, shit, that's Mrs. Blackwell.
- You killed my son!

34:40.000 --> 34:44.179
All right, go straight to the car.
Straight in. There you go.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.900
When my lawyers are done with you,
I'll be living in your house!

34:49.000 --> 34:51.060
- Sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- Sorry?

34:51.159 --> 34:53.139
- Let's go, let's go!
- You will be!

34:53.239 --> 34:54.860
Hank, come on!

34:54.960 --> 34:57.900
And you can shove all that "ma'am" shit.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.540
- Mom.
- Go.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.740
- I recognize you. You're no altar boy.
- Mom.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.305
Mom, come on.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.628
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.748
Why were those people so mad?

35:30.680 --> 35:33.220
She spit on the window.

35:33.320 --> 35:37.740
Dad's a judge, you know?
Sometimes he has to make difficult decisions.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.271
There was a girl.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.460
What was her name?

35:41.560 --> 35:43.150
Hope Stevens.

35:44.560 --> 35:48.540
There was a guy, Mark Blackwell.
He was a senior, like Glen.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.584
Hope was his girlfriend, just turned 16.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.780
He took a .38 to her house,
shot the place up.

35:54.880 --> 35:58.300
- Can we talk about something else?
- I don't get it. Why...?

35:58.400 --> 36:00.220
He shot out her bedroom windows.

36:00.320 --> 36:05.060
Angry over whatever kids get angry about
when they've been dating for six months.

36:05.160 --> 36:10.220
Now, you listen to me. He stood
in court and wept like a lost child.

36:10.320 --> 36:12.500
Said he was drunk,
would never do it again.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.220
If he'd meant to hurt her,
he would have.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.900
I believed him!

36:17.000 --> 36:19.706
I believed him. I believed him.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.100
I gave him the minimum, 30 days.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.382
I remember the morning he got out.

36:27.920 --> 36:33.180
Glen and I were in the backyard,
tinkering with his, breaking ball.

36:33.280 --> 36:38.068
Pitching scouts had started to come to
his games, from Cincinnati, Saint Louis.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.464
But...

36:41.240 --> 36:44.389
God help us. While we did that...

36:44.920 --> 36:46.180
Blackwell...

36:46.280 --> 36:48.020
drug her down to a spill pond.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.700
It was about 50 yards behind her house.

36:51.840 --> 36:56.628
He hauled her into two feet of water and
kneeled on her chest until he drowned her.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.700
Dad gave him 20 years.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.504
He got out in April.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.220
- Stop the car.
- Dad, come on.

37:06.320 --> 37:09.583
Shit-for-brains, am I speaking Korean?
Stop the goddamn car.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.380
I need my walk.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.860
Leaving the scene,
blood evidence, motive.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.740
Your biggest mistake,
and you just happen to run him over?

37:23.840 --> 37:25.380
I could convict you over coffee.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.140
But no, no, routines are important.
Close the door. Go.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.180
If the blood matches,
and I have no reason to doubt it does...

37:31.280 --> 37:33.020
then I must have clipped him.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.900
I don't remember any of that.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.180
The "I don't remember" defense
doesn't fly with a corpse.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.220
We need to establish a firm defense.

37:41.320 --> 37:44.740
We gotta make it all go away
at the preliminary hearing.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.100
We never go to trial.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.540
There's no "we" here, Henry.
This was an accident, period.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.100
Any decent lawyer can argue this easily.

37:52.200 --> 37:55.780
And by "decent," I mean honest.
Someone from here.

37:55.880 --> 37:59.700
Someone with integrity
that an Indiana judge will respect.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.461
I retained one of that breed
this morning. All right?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.950
I wish I liked you more.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.940
Oh, boy.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.100
- He didn't mean that.
- He didn't mean that.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.620
- I wish he died instead of Mom.
- Cut it out!

38:14.720 --> 38:16.620
- Cut it out!
- Eyes forward, you coward.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.620
- That's awful!
- He says, "Jump," you say, "How high?"

38:19.720 --> 38:22.300
- Hank, you shoot your mouth off too much!
- Where is he going?

38:22.400 --> 38:24.620
Driving Miss Daisy.
What a fucking coward you are.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.620
- Maybe we should follow Dad.
- Should I?

38:26.720 --> 38:29.949
Oh, God. Where were you two
when they were distributing testicles?

38:30.480 --> 38:33.550
- Fuck it, I'm out.
- Good. Good!

38:40.680 --> 38:42.420
Hey, judge, where you going?

38:42.520 --> 38:44.900
Indiana State Penitentiary is this way.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.943
Kiss my ass.

38:57.680 --> 39:01.751
What line were we in
when they were distributing testicles?

39:28.760 --> 39:30.988
You know I have to go, right?

40:58.520 --> 40:59.951
I love you.

41:10.640 --> 41:14.028
You're here to listen, not talk, okay?

41:15.800 --> 41:19.580
You know, the great thing about authentic
mercury glass is the double-wall.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.780
See that in there?
And right on the bottom:

41:21.880 --> 41:25.100
"New England Glass company."
What a great find.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.820
Wow.

41:26.920 --> 41:30.183
Guys, you wanna head upstairs
to my office?

41:31.640 --> 41:33.660
Judge Warren caught it.
You know him, sir?

41:33.760 --> 41:34.820
Yes, I do.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.460
He's tough, he's fair...

41:37.560 --> 41:39.820
and full of himself.

41:39.920 --> 41:43.020
They assigned a special prosecutor,
Dwight Dickham?

41:43.120 --> 41:46.460
Out of Gary? I wonder why so far.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.820
The preliminary hearing
is set for next Friday.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.340
Wow.

41:51.440 --> 41:54.820
- We're in a bit of a pickle.
- It's pretty straightforward, C.P.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.307
- It was dark...
- Hold up.

41:57.840 --> 42:02.020
What would you say your strong suit is,
old furniture or law? Quick.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.222
- Law. Law.
- Law school?

42:04.680 --> 42:05.780
Yes?

42:05.880 --> 42:08.620
Yes, you're familiar with the concept
or you attended one?

42:09.960 --> 42:13.621
You can't practice law without going
to law school. Yeah, Valpo.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.980
Valpo? Valparaiso? It's... Mom.

42:18.080 --> 42:22.020
I told her not to cover the Valparaiso.

42:22.120 --> 42:25.020
Come on.
I hate when she stacks books here.

42:25.120 --> 42:28.620
It's here in Indiana.
Did you go out of state?

42:28.720 --> 42:30.500
Northwestern.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.700
Wow. That's a dandy of a school.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.860
Ever defended in a jury trial?

42:34.960 --> 42:36.660
- Yes, I have.
- Charge?

42:36.760 --> 42:38.540
- Assault.
- Degree?

42:38.640 --> 42:40.300
- Third.
- Verdict?

42:40.400 --> 42:41.740
It was a guilty verdict.

42:42.240 --> 42:45.180
Coach Blakely broke a clipboard
over his quarterback's head...

42:45.280 --> 42:47.220
during halftime at the homecoming game.

42:47.320 --> 42:49.300
- Now, in his defense...
- Now he gets one.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.220
John Jr. had his helmet on.

42:51.320 --> 42:54.300
- He just keeps selling, doesn't he?
- Sit down.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.980
Just so you know...

42:56.080 --> 42:59.740
summers I interned at the public
defender's office in Evansville.

42:59.840 --> 43:03.740
I also clerked two years for Justice
Roberts on the Indiana Supreme Court.

43:03.840 --> 43:06.900
Which was a pretty cool experience.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.706
The word "wow,"
it's not your friend in court.

43:10.840 --> 43:12.660
Thank you. Duly noted.

43:12.760 --> 43:16.945
This is your guy? If he drops the ball,
you're facing a murder trial. Just so you know.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.104
I'm gonna get a coffee.

43:19.840 --> 43:24.580
Wow. This is a lawsuit right here.
Don't get sued before you lose your next case.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.350
Don't mind him.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.260
You're my guy.

43:28.360 --> 43:31.060
Your Honor, I'm gonna fight
like a badger for you.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.785
You can count on that.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.230
Morning.

44:00.840 --> 44:02.146
All rise.

44:02.880 --> 44:03.940
Court is in session.

44:04.040 --> 44:07.064
The Honorable Judge
Sanford Warren presiding.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.826
Be seated.

44:10.880 --> 44:14.460
I understand there's a motion
you'd like to be heard on.

44:14.560 --> 44:20.180
Your Honor, the deadline
for filing a change of venue motion...

44:20.280 --> 44:21.980
has already come and gone.

44:22.080 --> 44:25.180
So unless there's been a change
in circumstance that warrants...

44:25.280 --> 44:27.380
filing the motion out of time...

44:27.480 --> 44:31.630
Say, if the county up
and moved overnight.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.980
Barring that...

44:34.080 --> 44:36.540
this trial happens right
here in Carlinville.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.500
This is a preliminary hearing,
not a trial.

44:39.600 --> 44:43.307
What's the story, Mr. Dickham?
Filing for a change of venue?

44:46.160 --> 44:51.500
Out of curiosity, Your Honor, if I were to ask
for a change of venue, you'd say what?

44:51.600 --> 44:54.420
You missed the deadline,
but I'll consider it.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.180
- And then?
- Deny it. You missed your deadline.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.508
No motion, Your Honor.

45:01.520 --> 45:04.460
We're here to establish whether
there's probable cause...

45:04.560 --> 45:06.900
to bind this over for trial.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.900
I wanna hold the presentation of
evidence until I've taken testimony...

45:11.000 --> 45:13.180
after which I'll hear arguments.

45:13.280 --> 45:17.066
Without further delay,
let's get started, gentlemen.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.020
Sheriff, after you arrived,
what happened?

45:20.120 --> 45:22.507
When I approached the victim,
he was unresponsive.

45:24.240 --> 45:27.583
And at that time,
did you offer any assistance?

45:27.960 --> 45:29.540
He was dead, son.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.180
So no?

45:31.280 --> 45:33.620
- That's a no.
- Great.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.860
And exactly what did
Mr. Palmer tell you?

45:35.960 --> 45:38.820
Mr. Palmer stated he
drove his vehicle...

45:38.920 --> 45:40.620
His 1971 Cadillac DeVille?

45:40.720 --> 45:43.460
Correct.... The night of the accident.

45:43.560 --> 45:44.707
Okay.

45:45.840 --> 45:48.220
We can get this dismissed.
It was an accident.

45:48.320 --> 45:50.740
- And did you see...?
- Excuse me.

45:50.840 --> 45:53.060
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

45:53.160 --> 45:54.900
Sir, are you co-counsel?

45:55.000 --> 45:56.900
- He is not.
- No.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.943
Sit and zip it.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.780
Sir, did you form an opinion
as to the cause of death?

46:05.880 --> 46:07.580
Massive internal damage.

46:07.680 --> 46:10.020
Injuries consistent
with being struck by a car.

46:10.120 --> 46:12.940
Thank you, Dr. Putney.
No further questions, Your Honor.

46:13.040 --> 46:15.142
Cross-examination, Mr. Kennedy?

46:15.320 --> 46:19.100
No further que...
No, no questions, Your Honor.

46:19.200 --> 46:21.540
So you were working that
night at the mini-mart...

46:21.640 --> 46:23.900
and you saw Judge Palmer
and Mr. Blackwell.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.780
They was both over by the cooler.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.630
Did you see them make eye contact?

46:28.120 --> 46:33.020
Yeah. I saw Mr. Blackwell
and Judge Palmer make eye contact.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.940
And then what did Judge Palmer do?

46:35.040 --> 46:36.380
Dropped his eggs.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.660
That's it. Out. Bailiff, get rid of him.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.149
You read that.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.625
Not my first time.

46:59.760 --> 47:03.300
So after that, did they go out together?

47:03.400 --> 47:05.025
Did you see him follow him?

47:05.560 --> 47:07.660
All rise.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.460
Court is in session.

47:09.560 --> 47:12.550
The Honorable Judge
Sanford Warren presiding.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.471
Be seated.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.500
Based on the testimony
of the witnesses...

47:18.600 --> 47:21.380
and the evidence presented
by Mr. Dickham...

47:21.480 --> 47:25.869
the court finds probable cause
to hold this over for trial.

47:26.840 --> 47:30.340
Jury selection will begin
one week from today.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.702
See you folks in court.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.745
"Agreement from the Gipper's coach."

48:05.520 --> 48:07.100
Excuse me?

48:07.200 --> 48:11.191
"Agreement from the Gipper's coach,"
10 letters.

48:11.920 --> 48:14.068
"Aye of Knute."

48:14.480 --> 48:17.660
Knute Rockne, the great Notre Dame coach
from South Bend, Indiana.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.700
He knows the answer, yet he asks.

48:20.800 --> 48:23.267
Come in. Sit down.

48:23.640 --> 48:26.220
Let's hold some court. Yeah.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.900
Sit down.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.060
Now, peacefully, easily...

48:32.160 --> 48:34.220
easily...

48:35.880 --> 48:39.580
Why do you think Dickham
missed the filing deadline...

48:39.680 --> 48:41.140
for a change of venue?

48:41.240 --> 48:44.020
Oh, he didn't miss the deadline.
It's a small town.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.980
For every two people who stand in
front of you, one wins, one loses.

48:47.080 --> 48:49.580
- One loves you, one hates you.
- Yes, yes, yes.

48:49.680 --> 48:53.705
Pretty obvious that Dickham had no
intention of filing. He wants the trial here.

48:55.440 --> 48:58.225
C.P. stepped down this morning.

48:59.800 --> 49:00.980
Why?

49:01.080 --> 49:03.260
Said he'd assist a more
seasoned attorney.

49:03.360 --> 49:08.785
Couldn't live with himself if his lack
of experience cost the case. So...

49:09.520 --> 49:12.060
Confidentially, what were you doing
on Shelby Road?

49:12.160 --> 49:14.860
There's no route from the mini-mart home
where that makes sense.

49:14.960 --> 49:16.505
Wait, wait, wait.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.780
Are you asking if you can represent me?

49:22.960 --> 49:24.107
Okay.

49:25.120 --> 49:28.380
I remember being there at the mini-mart.
I needed eggs.

49:28.480 --> 49:32.420
The road home was washed out,
where it dips near the old mill.

49:32.520 --> 49:35.980
I turned around,
stopped at the light on State.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.944
Then...

49:38.920 --> 49:41.910
I'm missing time, so...

49:50.720 --> 49:53.346
- Can I borrow your pen?
- Yeah.

49:55.600 --> 49:59.300
To answer your question, no,
I'm not asking if I can represent you.

49:59.400 --> 50:00.706
It doesn't work that way.

50:01.200 --> 50:04.110
You can't afford me,
so I'd have to do it for free.

50:04.600 --> 50:09.866
Fortunately, I'm a bit light
on my pro bono quota this year.

50:10.360 --> 50:13.260
So this is my standard
services contract.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.700
Check, sign and date.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.980
Offer expires end of business day.

50:19.080 --> 50:21.023
I'll give it a think.

50:44.120 --> 50:45.620
The artiste at work.

50:45.720 --> 50:48.380
Hey, Hank. I'm splicing film.

50:48.480 --> 50:49.700
I see.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.860
- You can help if you want.
- No, just watching. Know what's funny?

50:52.960 --> 50:56.860
When you said that the old man was
playing chess every Wednesday with...

50:56.960 --> 50:58.220
who was it?

50:58.320 --> 51:02.106
- With Doc Morris.
- Yeah. Because he doesn't play chess.

51:03.240 --> 51:07.026
In fact, the only thing he detests
more than board games is doctors.

51:08.040 --> 51:09.585
He does so play chess.

51:10.040 --> 51:12.188
I'll show you. I have it...

51:13.080 --> 51:16.502
it's not really ready yet, but...

51:24.280 --> 51:27.224
That's a grackle.
They're a real nuisance.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.664
And there's the lake.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.023
Here's the porch.

51:42.240 --> 51:45.025
See? He's playing chess.

51:46.360 --> 51:47.791
Stop.

51:55.760 --> 51:57.420
That's a nice frame.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.304
Thanks.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.340
What else you got?

52:01.440 --> 52:06.260
Well, if you wait, you'll see I got a whole
family of muskrats crossing the lake.

52:06.360 --> 52:07.985
Yeah.

52:10.280 --> 52:12.060
Body recovered there.

52:12.160 --> 52:14.342
- Figure impact right here.
- Yeah.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.580
- Police report has him on a bike.
- Yeah.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.580
I don't see any skid marks.

52:20.680 --> 52:23.300
Okay. Hey, here it is. Lawyer to client:

52:23.400 --> 52:25.628
Did you recognize Blackwell?

52:25.880 --> 52:28.340
- I don't remember. I can't have.
- No, no.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.420
"Can't have." Stick with that.

52:30.520 --> 52:34.180
We know you didn't intentionally hit him,
but that's the way they'll spin it.

52:34.280 --> 52:37.740
A few shots of Jack mixed with just
the right amount of ax to grind...

52:37.840 --> 52:40.060
That's what I thought.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.860
But you haven't been drinking, have you?

52:42.960 --> 52:44.869
- No.
- You sick, Pop?

52:46.600 --> 52:48.464
You might say I'm sick, yes.

52:49.600 --> 52:50.701
Yeah.

52:51.640 --> 52:54.346
Cancer. In my plumbing.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.149
Colon.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.460
Few more chemo sessions, it'll be in...

53:00.560 --> 53:02.105
In, remission.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.100
Nothing I can't handle.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.348
Nobody knows.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.943
Your mother knew, that's all.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.660
They need intent for murder.
That's our case.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.340
We roll out a diminished-ability defense
due to chemo.

53:15.440 --> 53:18.020
If we gain the jury's sympathy,
they'll never convict you.

53:18.120 --> 53:19.420
Wait. Hold on.

53:19.520 --> 53:23.340
- Native son, public servant for over 40 years...
- No, no. No, back up. Back up!

53:23.440 --> 53:27.670
Look what that does to all the cases
I've heard for the last year.

53:28.120 --> 53:29.980
You've had this a year?

53:30.080 --> 53:32.660
Everybody I sentenced
will challenge the ruling.

53:32.760 --> 53:34.908
Who gives a shit? You'll die in prison.

53:35.640 --> 53:38.500
I'd rather die in prison
than be remembered like that.

53:38.600 --> 53:41.220
- Oh, boy.
- An incompetent old man on the stand. No.

53:41.320 --> 53:44.620
Pfft. Oh, I'm not letting you
anywhere near the stand.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.860
Listen to me. Ulysses S. Grant
held this country together.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.860
Now, what's he remembered for?
Being a drunk.

53:50.960 --> 53:54.540
Ronald Reagan oversaw the fall of the
Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War.

53:54.640 --> 54:00.380
But any discussion of his legacy ends
with jelly beans, naps and Alzheimer's.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.460
- Reagan? Wow.
- Yeah.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.100
With all due...

54:04.200 --> 54:08.100
I'm gonna say this as professionally
and gently as I possibly can.

54:08.200 --> 54:12.900
You're a civil servant in a corn-belt,
Bible-banging backwater.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.140
Nobody, nobody, gives a rat's ass
about your legacy.

54:17.240 --> 54:19.300
But I do, you see. I do.

54:19.400 --> 54:22.660
I sat on the bench
in that courtroom for 42 years.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.900
People in this community trust me.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.740
They trust the law.

54:26.840 --> 54:28.420
Now, this...

54:28.520 --> 54:32.511
This accident is a legal
iron ball, Henry.

54:33.560 --> 54:35.469
You can't screw it up.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.625
So don't.

54:39.960 --> 54:41.540
Yeah.

54:41.640 --> 54:45.540
And only guilty people refuse
to take the stand. Got me?

54:45.640 --> 54:49.380
You tie my shoelaces together. I can't
help you if you won't let me do my job.

54:49.480 --> 54:51.742
Unlock the car. Come on.
I wanna go home.

55:01.800 --> 55:04.187
Goddamn it.

55:47.840 --> 55:49.860
Old-school.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.704
No! Unh.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.706
Fuck me.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.389
I only own the one black dress.

56:29.560 --> 56:33.187
Hank, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
This is my daughter, Carla.

56:37.520 --> 56:41.670
Well, light a match and hold my hair back.
This is your Hank?

56:42.120 --> 56:44.905
Girl, just try not to
embarrass me, okay?

56:48.720 --> 56:50.980
- You've... You two met?
- No.

56:51.080 --> 56:52.740
- Yeah. At the bar.
- Yes.

56:52.840 --> 56:55.820
- Right?
- Girl, what is up with you? Turn around.

56:59.360 --> 57:01.540
- What?
- I see that T-shirt survived.

57:01.640 --> 57:05.426
- The night Hank vanished from Carlinville.
- Since when have you had a daughter?

57:05.800 --> 57:07.420
February 1990.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.861
She's home for summer break.

57:11.840 --> 57:14.580
- Were you married?
- Negative.

57:14.680 --> 57:17.620
No, I am the unplanned
but happy result...

57:17.720 --> 57:19.948
of a Wabash River float trip.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.940
Yeah. Kool-Aid and Everclear.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.900
And now Carla goes to Georgetown.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.100
D.C.? Georgetown?

57:26.200 --> 57:29.986
- Wow.
- You ever in Washington, Mr. Palmer?

57:31.800 --> 57:34.631
Never. What are you studying?

57:35.720 --> 57:37.470
Law.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.300
Always on grass.

57:55.400 --> 57:57.860
Never on pavement.
Won't splash your shoes that way.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.700
I don't know what my problem is.

57:59.800 --> 58:03.180
You're invested in your client.
You feel the life in your hands.

58:03.280 --> 58:05.747
Both pass. Trust me.

58:06.040 --> 58:08.108
I hope not.

58:09.360 --> 58:13.100
So you're telling me that you're not
even a little bit swayed by the fact...

58:13.200 --> 58:16.300
that you're familiar with the defendant
and his stature in the community?

58:16.400 --> 58:19.860
Now, what exactly is our target juror?

58:19.960 --> 58:24.300
Intelligent people who will listen
to instructions and follow the evidence.

58:24.400 --> 58:28.260
Crackpots. Those I can persuade
to swallow their own tongues.

58:28.360 --> 58:30.820
Anyone who's seen a sasquatch.

58:30.920 --> 58:34.180
Moon-landing deniers.
Those are our people.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.427
Mr. Palmer.

58:36.600 --> 58:39.544
Subtlety, Henry. A velvet touch.

58:48.240 --> 58:51.180
Bumper stickers?
Anybody got one on their car, truck, RV?

58:51.280 --> 58:52.666
Show of hands.

58:54.280 --> 58:57.460
And what do they read?
Exact words, please.

58:57.560 --> 59:01.062
It just spells out "tolerance"
with religious symbols.

59:06.640 --> 59:08.700
"Willie Nelson for President."

59:08.800 --> 59:10.860
Really? Does he seem a likely candidate?

59:10.960 --> 59:13.222
They never got him on a felony.

59:16.200 --> 59:20.669
"Certified Breast inspector.
Have Them Out."

59:23.440 --> 59:26.066
"Gun Control Means Using Both Hands."

59:27.400 --> 59:28.990
"Honor Roll Student on Board."

59:31.960 --> 59:36.020
"Wife and Dog Missing, Reward for Dog."

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.462
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.300
I missed you, baby.
It's gonna be such a fun weekend.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.940
Unless I drop you down the escalator!

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.180
Lauren...

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.340
I feel like I should prep you
before you meet Grandpa Palmer.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.260
He is nothing like Grandpa Schneider.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.060
Grandpa Schneider is kind of,
you know, nice and affable.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.620
He'd take you for ice cream,
maybe read to you.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.780
Grandpa Palmer
doesn't wanna do any of that.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.300
If you ask him to read,
he might throw the book at you.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.860
Anyway, don't worry about it.
I mean, he's not evil.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.270
He's just a dirty old mummy, and he
can't hurt you, because you're special.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.460
Oh, my God, there he is. Look.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.621
He's usually wrapped in gauze,
and oozing and shuffling.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.183
He must have come outside to feed.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.420
Who are you?

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.980
- Lauren.
- Lauren.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.620
You know who I am?

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.060
- Grandpa.
- Yeah.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.467
You're my granddaughter?

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.910
Let's... Come on with me.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.543
Yeah.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.980
Glad to be here?

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.750
Okay.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.700
It's been a long time.
I waited a long time for this.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.340
You're my little sweetheart.
I'll show you the house. Come on.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.660
You're the first
granddaughter I ever had.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.546
In fact, you're the first girl
in this family in a long time.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.900
I think Grandpa's sweet.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.100
Yeah, he isn't. But I'm
glad you see it that way.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.300
Okay, all right.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.940
That's super comfy. There you go.
You want a second pillow?

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.540
- Yes.
- Good. Now put your head down.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.140
There you go.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.220
And now...

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.700
Oh, maybe I'm gonna strangle her.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.460
You good? Okay.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.981
There's ghosts here.
I'm gonna leave you alone now.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.984
Whose room is this?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.387
It was your uncle Glen's.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.500
Why are there so many trophies?

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.589
He was a really good baseball player.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.745
Really good.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.740
Did he play on TV?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.380
He probably would have been
on a big team...

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.108
but when Glen and I were in high school,
we got in a really bad car accident.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.543
Then his hand got messed up.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.585
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.431
Why didn't he take his trophies
to his own house?

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.547
They were more important to his father.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.461
Kind of a touchy subject. Go to sleep.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.107
- Night, baby.
- Night, Dad.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.820
Okay, let's rehearse.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.580
Mr. Palmer, Mark Blackwell appeared in your
court prior to killing Miss Stevens, correct?

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.780
Well, a lot of people appeared
in my court, but...

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.300
But you'd agree there were special
circumstances surrounding this case.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.060
Most people think that their cases
are pretty special.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.300
There's no snacks on the witness stand.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.940
- Give it back.
- No. No distractions.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.620
I don't need preparing.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.620
You've never sat on a witness stand.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.868
You've never been in that seat.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.380
Dickham doesn't have intent, Henry.
And he never will.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.460
Dickham is a snake charmer.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.980
He'll play his tune, get the jury
swinging to his version of that night.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.660
Then you can say goodbye to your dreams of
flags flying at half-mast when you're dead.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:04.103
It's "half-staff."
No one says "half-mast" anymore.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.630
Yeah? Let's remain unprepared. Fuck it.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.700
All right.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.500
No need to be so morose...

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.986
Henry.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.180
Sam.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.940
Can you hear me?
Well, my head's in the oven.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:30.225
I was just thinking it was either that
or maybe I shower up and come meet you.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.500
God. Okay. There?

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.986
All right.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.140
Oh, my God.
It looks taller than it used to.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.540
Did they raise it?

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.391
- Come on, big city, show me what you got.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.945
All right.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.860
All right, I'm just gonna
stretch out for a sec.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.540
Unh. Come on, give me a boost.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.589
God, too easy.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.220
We're in.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.740
Every night that goes between

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.500
So it's midnight.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.540
I'm on the Dayton blacktop,
hauling ass home.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.740
Seventy-six Chevette,
fake wood paneling.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.460
No. Dad's Maverick.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.583
- I know, right?
- What were you thinking?

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.100
Corner of my eye, I spot something.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.300
Biggest buck you have ever seen.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.900
Twelve, 14 points...

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.707
200 pounds, give or take,
charging the road, straight for me.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.900
We skid, one hand on the wheel,
one hand on Carla.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.465
This deer jumps...

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.780
flies over the hood.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.700
Its back hoof taps the glass.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.580
And one mile per hour faster...

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.660
he's coming through the windshield...

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.988
killing me for sure, maybe both of us.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.261
I make a decision right then and there.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.500
Whatever had or hadn't happened
in the past...

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.863
I was gonna be the hero of my own story.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.630
- Sound corny?
- Sounds epic.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.140
I had 4 grand to my name.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.300
I borrowed another 12 from Grandpa,
took that 16 grand.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.540
I made Dan an offer for the diner
that he couldn't refuse.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.900
- This place was on its last legs...
- This is your place.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.460
- Yes, this is my place.
- What did I bust into it for?

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.220
For my amusement.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.820
Worth the broken window.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.424
Bought the tavern three years later.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:50.548
I got money. A lot of money.
I got money like the Colonel's got chicken.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.940
- You're an entrepreneurial spirit.
- Yeah.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.940
Okay, I'm impressed.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.180
We've known each other
since the third grade.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.580
You didn't already know enough
to be impressed?

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.740
- I always liked you, just...
- You are a dick.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.181
This is different.
This is about accomplishment.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:12.229
Though the love has always been

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:19.466
So I search to find an answer there

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.220
So I can truly win

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.821
- There you are.
- All right, babe.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.300
Except it was second grade.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.420
- What?
- It's second grade.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.660
In Ms. Jenkins' class, on the
kickball field in the south corner...

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:42.620
is where I tried to kiss you
and you fish-hooked me.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.390
Tasted like cinnamon.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.300
Pop. One of those.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.260
You just broke off to reminisce?

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.660
Just a sidebar.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.544
Okay.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.905
Come on.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:03.426
So I try to say goodbye, my friend

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.220
What's wrong?

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.980
You know I'm leaving when the trial's over.
Are you sure we should do this?

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.740
Am I sure?

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.227
He's sure. I'm wondering if you're sure.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:19.871
Man.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.305
Why did we come here?

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.260
I love seeing you here...

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:28.100
but I'm not naive, Hank. I know you.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.300
What do you think you know?

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.706
Honestly?

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:34.580
That I'm a decent guy? That I'm loyal?

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.380
That I'm a phenomenal lawyer, that I got
a work ethic that'll rival the Amish?

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:39.899
What do you know?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.340
Say it. I'm used to being
held under scrutiny.

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:45.779
Here's what I know:

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.666
I am never leaving Carlinville.
I love it here.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.140
And you're just a boy from Indiana...

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.787
who's gonna do whatever he has to do
to pretend that's not true.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.700
Lock the door behind you.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.346
I'm gonna go play with myself.
I'll be thinking of you.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.660
And I made out with your daughter.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.988
Fuck.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.340
Judge says he's missing time.
Explain that to me.

01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:30.140
It's called "chemo brain."

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.979
Along with the fatigue
and the cracked skin...

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.899
you can sometimes suffer
from memory loss...

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.309
confusion, dementia, delusions.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.899
There's a real possibility that he was
mentally impaired when he hit Blackwell.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.500
If you can corroborate that,
I need it in my pocket.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.180
I may need you to testify.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:51.100
He's getting chemotherapy
in a fishing cabin.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.180
I don't think he wants anyone knowing.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.860
And I'm his doctor.
I'm bound by his wishes.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.710
Bound by his wishes or his vanity?

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.580
When will he be done
with the treatments?

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.350
That's up to him.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.905
On him?

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.780
But...

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.180
how would he know?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.300
So, what exactly did he tell you?

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.741
Told me it's under control.
It's in remission.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.780
Give it up, you country quack.
I'm not his son. I'm his fucking lawyer.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.380
This isn't an act.
You aren't a pleasant person.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.423
Right now? I'm a summer breeze.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.820
Once I subpoena you,
get you on the stand...

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.860
and extract the truth from your ass...

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.065
then you'll realize in that moment,
correct, I'm not a pleasant person.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.500
We caught it too late to cut it out.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.180
To slap a bag on it.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.862
If he'd had regular screenings...

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.503
But the judge wasn't the type to invite
a camera with any degree of regularity.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.220
Your mother insisted that he try.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.630
I suspect he's still doing it for her.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.587
I've been treating him for a year.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.667
His condition is advanced.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.422
Stage 4.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.380
The pain will increase.
We'll manage that with morphine.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.500
"CafÃ© du Monde."

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.540
"The clouds...

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.462
were ripped like the
strip of fire above."

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.380
What's a hush puppy?

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.661
Good for you.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.461
- Get out of here.
- Dad, give me your hand.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.190
Get out.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.264
Why are my shoes off?

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.620
You're okay. Just stay.
Stay right there.

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.141
- Let go of my hand.
- No, no, no.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.020
- Why don't we just do this? Let's go to the tub.
- Ooh.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.820
- Okay? Careful where you're stepping.
- Okay.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.986
- Oh, yeah.
- Can you get your leg over?

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.580
- There you go.
- Oh, hoo, hoo, hoo.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.140
- Is that okay?
- Okay, let's go.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.660
- How's that temperature? Is it okay?
- Too hot.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.750
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh! Yeah.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.742
Ooh. That's a little colder.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.060
Nice. It's good.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.060
- What is it?
- Can I come in?

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.980
I'll be out in a minute. Go eat.
Finish your hush puppies.

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.500
I'm full.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.500
In a minute, Lauren.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.941
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.340
- What?
- What are we doing?

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.860
I don't know. Fixing the sink.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.860
We're fixing the sink. It leaks.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.820
- Can I help?
- She'll slip. There's too much water.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.780
No, there's water all over the floor.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:54.780
All right, go do something.
Grandpa and I will be down in a minute.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.060
- Ooh.
- Knock, knock.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.707
- Lauren...
- I wasn't talking to you.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.420
Who's there?

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.304
Army.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.180
Army who?

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.748
Are me and Grandpa
still going for ice cream?

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.862
Okay.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.751
Tell me about Lauren. Likes, dislikes?

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.949
What the future may hold for you?

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.100
Where you leaning? Teacher? Doctor?

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.190
Lawyer. Seems popular lately.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.308
Racecar driver.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.185
I just like to go really fast.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.260
You're thinking, aren't you?

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.620
I got a bad idea.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.345
But it could be fun.

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.420
- You're looking at the road?
- Yeah.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.590
Doing awesome. Check your mirrors.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.423
You're a natural, by the way.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.020
I feel like I could just take my hands
off the wheel and let you drive.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.461
Don't you do it when I do it.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.031
All right?

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.980
See?

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.620
And that's how you keep abreast
of what's going on on the road.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.380
When are you and Mommy
getting a divorce?

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.390
What? Put your hands at 10 and 2.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.260
Where did you hear that?

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.383
It's pretty obvious.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.420
Well, the way these things work...

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.020
you know, it takes a long time.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.660
It happens in stages, and...

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.420
Your stuff is in boxes.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.940
That's a stage.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.871
You're not wearing your wedding rings.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.180
And you're probably gonna ask me
who I wanna live with.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.140
So, what stage are we in?

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.183
That one.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.268
You know too much.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.860
Mommy would be lonely.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.380
Yeah, what about me?

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.866
So would I.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.940
Daddies don't get lonely.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.825
They only marry younger mommies.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.349
Well, we'll figure it all out, baby.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.220
It happened to Megan.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.220
Then it happened to Katlin.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.106
I just didn't think it
would happen to me.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.624
Me neither.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.425
You wanna turn left up here?

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.420
I'm just gonna let you drive home.
You're doing great.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.460
You're making the turn all by yourself.
Good girl, good girl, good girl.

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.820
So when you see Mom,
what are you supposed to say?

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.820
Best vacation ever.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.660
Yeah, that's pretty good. Just don't oversell it.
You know what I mean?

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.780
Hey. Thanks.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.584
You gonna be all right?

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.305
You will be fine. You're something else.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.143
Hey, Daddy.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.067
Best vacation ever.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.940
It's a coincidence.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.630
That's what that was.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.505
June, July, August, September,
October, November, December, January...

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.980
June, July, August, September,
October, November... The fuck?

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.787
Here we go.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.780
Sir, I appreciate the primer
in DNA evidence analysis.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:40.300
But bottom-line this for us: What do all
these numbers and percentages mean...

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.380
when determining if it's Mark
Blackwell's blood on the car?

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.380
- It's the victim's blood on the car.
- Didn't take a swing at Mr. Blackwell?

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.780
No, sir.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.460
Use profanity, rant,
rave, flip him off...

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.260
display any sign of hostility?

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.620
No. None of that.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.540
Dr. Brannamon, you found something
else in his system at the time of death?

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:05.340
Yes, we did. Mark Blackwell had
oxycodone-paracetamol in his blood. Percocet.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.780
And your lab registered
his blood alcohol level...

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.820
- ...at .23?
- Yes.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.900
In that condition, could he have
been riding in a straight line?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.220
If he could ride a bike at all,
it would have been swerving.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.220
Mrs. Blackwell, after all those
years and all that heartbreak...

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.420
how did you feel when he was released?

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.260
I finally had my Mark back.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.180
I'd waited so long for him to come home.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.589
No mother should have to bury her child.
Thank you, ma'am.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.940
How often did you visit Mark in prison?

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.940
I don't remember. Too many times.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:46.782
Perhaps the visitation records will
refresh your memory. How many times?

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.420
Twice.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.270
- Pardon me?
- Twice!

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.991
Oh. So not "too many times."
Two times in 20 years. Twice.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.270
One for each hand.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.700
It's a 20-degree bend at best.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.380
So, Deputy Hanson, looking at
this road, there is no indication...

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.220
that Judge Palmer tried
to slow his vehicle.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.460
No.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.700
As a matter of fact, there are no
brake marks at all, are there?

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.140
No, sir.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.700
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.300
Mr. Palmer.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.620
Deputy Hanson, you were previously
an officer in Detroit.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.100
Objection. The deputy's credentials
are not in question.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.380
I was gonna say
"Welcome to Carlinville."

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.021
As stated by Mr. Dickham, these photos
were taken the morning of the incident.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.508
What is that? Can you help me?

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.465
Right there.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.625
Not really, no.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.500
Does that help?

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.820
Road kill. Raccoon, maybe.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.780
Is there an offer of proof here?

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.300
- What's your point, Mr. Palmer?
- That there is a snapping turtle.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:01.100
- And?
- And Detroit can be forgiven...

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.340
for not knowing what running over
a snapping turtle is like.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.191
Nobody hits one if they see it
and can possibly avoid it.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.180
You hit a rabbit, possum, skunk,
your car goes "boop, boop."

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.700
But nailing a big snapper is similar
to smacking into a cinderblock.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.222
Car goes, "Kablam! Kaboom!"

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.020
Mr. Palmer, where exactly
are you going with this?

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.940
Well, Your Honor...

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.380
the prosecution maintains
that a lack of brake marks...

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:31.100
is evidence that Mr. Blackwell
was deliberately struck.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.340
That it's not reasonable to assume Judge
Palmer could have hit something substantial...

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.860
in the dark, raining...

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.540
not realized it was a person
that was hit, just kept going.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.665
That's been firmly established.
Are we within a mile of a question here?

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.143
Question is, deputy:

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.741
Any brake marks in front of that turtle?

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.785
Yes, no?

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.027
No, there are not.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.906
Thank you. That's all I have.

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.867
You rearrange everything!

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.380
All right, Mary. Wait, what, what, what?

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.220
What? Goddamn!

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.100
Don't be a you-know-what, Mary!
Don't be a you-know-what.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:45.020
My memory plays tricks on me.
It plays tricks on me.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.542
You left too soon, Mary.
You left too soon.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.780
Hey. Hey.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.631
I think I heard you having a bad dream.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.302
God, what happened to your hands?

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.346
Here. This'll make your skin soft.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.421
Hey.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.060
Hey, hey. Who's the best lawyer
you've ever seen? Come on.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.548
Mine's Robert Graham. I worked for him.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:36.309
He just doesn't lose.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.710
Now you.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.945
Mr. Shaw.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.780
My first job after law school.
A drifter killed a farmer, violated his wife.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.780
Five Points Road with a corn knife.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.300
Vile human being. Vile.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.549
Court assigned Mr. Shaw the case.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:04.260
So we took dinner to the jail
because every night Mr. Shaw sat with him.

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.907
Prepared him, defended him.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.030
No tricks.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.300
He won?

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.020
Electrocuted.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.067
He was dead, but Mr. Shaw
had to live here.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.066
He was threatened, spit on.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.423
People wouldn't sit near him in church.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:34.420
He could have refused the case easily,
but he believed in the law.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.060
I can't say, "best."

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.220
But Henry Shaw?

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.580
Most decent man I ever met.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.021
Ever. Ever.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.460
Yeah.

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.707
"Henry"?

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.950
Decent man.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.780
Great man.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.948
Henry Shaw.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.140
Hank Palmer.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.260
Hank? Sheriff White.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.704
Wondering if you can come by the station.
There's something you should see.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.100
We've already seen the security
footage from the accident night.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:24.305
The judge leaves the store, his car
goes one way, Blackwell the other.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.901
Patience.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.630
- Time?
- Four minutes 45.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.420
He didn't get to the mill.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.300
And? Point being?

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.780
In his statement, Judge Palmer said
he reached the road near the mill...

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.460
it was washed out, and he turned around.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.140
He's lying. It takes nine minutes
to get to the mill and back.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:02.865
Your dad did it in five.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.340
He didn't turn around
because it was washed out.

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.420
He turned around to follow Blackwell.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:12.220
He's lived here his whole life. Think he
can't gauge when the road will flood?

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.344
- That's not the point.
- Sheriff, may we use your office?

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.300
Thanks.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.468
Well, you know how to clear a room.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.460
- Ten years.
- Insufficient evidence.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.340
Offer expires when you leave.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.180
- You want me to fly you?
- Glad to see you're on your game.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.980
I like you too, but I'm so bored.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.342
I have intent now.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.060
Premeditation.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:41.460
I'll paint your father as a holier-than-thou
prick determined to see justice served.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.500
My father is a holier-than-thou prick...

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.749
determined to see justice served,
so it's gonna be a light day.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.750
That's funny.

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.740
I guess I can't fault you
for not remembering me.

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.980
I was just second chair
for the prosecution.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:59.620
You defended that Milwaukee beer
baron's kid who went slumming in Gary.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.700
Forty million in the bank,
one dead prostitute?

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.380
By God, you're good.
Best verdict money can buy.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:10.220
Everybody wants Atticus Finch
till there's a dead hooker in a hot tub.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.580
There's your bumper sticker.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.220
So, in a nutshell, you're following me
down here to settle a score?

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.104
Good Lord, no.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.260
I followed you down here
because I knew if I didn't...

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.060
it was likely somebody
was gonna get away with murder.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.100
My father's a lot of unpleasant things.
A murderer is not one.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.620
But he is a liar.
We've established that.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:35.064
A liar who thinks he can operate under
the color of the law, just like his son.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.860
You're a shined-up wooden nickel,
Mr. Palmer.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.660
A bully with a big bag of tricks.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.909
But unlike you, I have
one simple belief:

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.306
that the law is the only thing capable
of making people equal.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.420
You may think Mark Blackwell was white trash,
and he may very well have been...

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.703
but in the eyes of the state,
his life matters.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.869
I'm gonna impale your client
on a first-degree murder charge.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.306
And you get a front-row seat.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.985
Why are we even down here?

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.620
Like, it is never a tornado.
This is stupid.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.027
Be happy your grandpa has a basement.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.540
Oh, boy.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.266
Don't worry, everyone. I got it.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.780
Hey, turn that on, Uncle Dale.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.029
Yeah, why don't you show us
what you've been working on?

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.541
Come on. Let's go.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.181
Okay.

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.900
Charles Francis Jenkins
first invented the projector...

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.580
on June 6th, 1894,
in Wayne County, Indiana.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.780
Dale, can you show the movie
that you made? Thank you.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.940
- Here we go.
- All right.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.700
Good going, Dale.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.664
- Wow, looks like Christmas.
- Oh, nice.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.700
Oh, family Christmas.
Look at you guys in your p.j.'s.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.386
That's us.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.907
- That's our family.
- Yeah, it is.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.227
- Oh, Grandma.
- There's me.

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.780
- It's sweet.
- It is.

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.340
Dad, you were cute once.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.620
There's Hank and Dad.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.426
Judge, you had hair? Oh, look at you.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.380
- There you are.
- Watch and learn, boys.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.060
Watch and learn.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.340
Look at that. Oh, look at that.

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.180
- Jesus!
- Wow. Look at that arm.

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.660
What an arm.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.660
Victory.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:33.591
- That was the best day.
- You betcha.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.146
- Proud mama.
- Yeah, Dad.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.463
- Holy shit.
- Shut up, Joe.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.140
Turn it off.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.780
All right, speed it up, man.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.260
- I can't.
- Next, Dale.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.100
- It's film. I can't...
- Next. Next.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.060
Crank the thing with your
hand if you have to. Let's go.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.581
- Give him a chance.
- Turn it off!

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.380
- Okay, all right!
- Enough!

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.300
We're gonna fix it.
We're gonna fix it. It's okay.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.860
- Not in this house.
- Dad! Shit!

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.620
Oh, no.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.140
That's it. I am so sick of you.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.100
I'm tired of the way
you decide how the world is gonna run.

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:31.780
You're gonna parcel out who gets to say
and do what and when you say it?

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.420
I decide in this house.
You go decide in your house.

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.660
No, I can't!

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.300
I'm stuck in purgatory
with a client who's doing...

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.620
everything in his power
to be found guilty.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.540
You didn't make it anywhere
near the mill, did you?

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.660
You hung me out to fucking dry with Dwight
Dickham because you held out on me!

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.340
- I told you everything!
- Wrong!

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.820
You told me everything
you decided I could know!

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.500
- You guys, come on!
- Get out of my way!

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.660
- Easy, Dad!
- Fuck it!

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.500
Dad, where are you going?

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.940
All right! Dad, you can't go out there!

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.820
Grandpa, where you going?
What are you doing?

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.620
Get your gimp hand off me!

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.100
- Goddamn it, Hank!
- Where is he going?

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.220
Why'd you pull me out of Boy Scouts?

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.700
As punishment for blowing up
the McGraws' mailbox with M-80s.

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.700
I was 13. That, you remember.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.540
Oh. Old enough to know better.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.860
You didn't come to my high-school
graduation or college.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.340
- Oh. Boo-fucking-hoo. Why?
- Why?

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:52.220
Jail time, truancy. I wasn't gonna
reward anything. None of your shit.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.900
I graduated from law school,
for chrissake.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.860
- As opposed to what, dropping out? Ooh.
- Fuck you!

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:00.180
Let me tell you something, okay? Here.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.580
I put a roof over your head,
money in your pocket...

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:07.020
clothes on your back,
food in your mouth!

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.700
Who paid for that college education
I never showed up to kiss your ass over?

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.060
Your mother? She was a housewife.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.900
Why couldn't you swallow your pride
and come home to her?

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.260
You tell me why!

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:21.260
You'd invite people at the end
of parole back to court.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.660
You'd recognize those who did their time,
turned their lives around...

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.340
made something of themselves.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.180
Everyone in court would applaud.
You'd make sure they did.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:33.749
Tell them how proud you were.
Proud of fucking strangers.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:38.340
Is that all you wanted, Henry?
A kind word and "attaboy"?

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:43.023
Then to use your words,
you should have come the fuck home!

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.260
We all waited.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.580
Quietly.

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.100
But you never came.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.140
Okay? And I was the one she blamed
because you wouldn't come home. Me.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.980
Now, was I tough on you? Yes.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.460
How'd you turn out, Henry?
Waiting tables? A bum?

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.662
You put me in juvenile detention.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.700
You sent me to fucking Vanderburgh!

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:06.140
- No, you put yourself there. Yes.
- Did I?

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.460
The prosecutor recommended
community service.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.460
No. It wouldn't have helped you.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.780
I didn't need help. I needed you!

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:15.540
You were high. You rolled a
car with your brother in it.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.580
He had a Major League career
ahead of him...

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.340
- ...and he runs a tire shop.
- Fuck.

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.940
You crippled him, you stole his future,
and you call me an asshole?

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.020
- I was just 17. That's what happened.
- Oh.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.460
"I was 13. I was 17."

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:34.140
You were headed down the wrong path.
I did what I thought was right.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.660
You know, I didn't just graduate
from law school.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:40.580
I graduated first in my class.
I was first in my class.

01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.660
I did really well, Dad.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.625
- You're welcome.
- Fuck.

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.740
Tear this house down.

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.149
I could tear this fucking house down.

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:11.104
- How about that storm, huh?
- Mm.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:16.466
I'm glad you and Mom
became friends, and... Why?

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.949
- Why, Sam?
- Why?

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:28.700
- Who the fuck is Carla's dad? Please.
- Go to the courthouse.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.740
- Pull her birth certificate.
- I did.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.900
- There's no father's name listed.
- No, there is not.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.500
Because Carla's father
was never gonna be her father.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.623
Him knowing would
just complicate things.

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.460
There was no Wabash River float trip.
There was no Everclear and Kool-Aid.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.860
It was just one of those lies
we tell ourselves...

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.060
in order to move on, and we did.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.149
Great, I get to move on too.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.302
What lies you gonna tell me?

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.660
That it was fine with me when you left
to go to that goddamn concert...

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.749
and you never called again.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.269
That...

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:15.584
I am entirely comfortable with Carla
never knowing who her father is.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.180
That you're the only one who's gonna
get hurt when you run away again...

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:23.984
like you always do.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.340
Oh, I know that look.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.780
You're a bullshitter.

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:32.382
Well, yeah, it's my bullshit.
Kindly remove your shoes from it.

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.461
See you in 20 years.

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.623
Looking forward.

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.826
Finally opened her up, huh?

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.265
Yeah.

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:28.140
Evan Williams. She was 23 years old
when I drove down to Bardstown...

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.661
Kentucky, 1979, to buy her.

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.540
I almost cracked this baby
open a thousand times.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.344
Yeah, be glad you didn't.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.580
Yep.

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.980
You gonna tell me I shouldn't drink?

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.944
You're a big boy.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.110
Long as you're ready for tomorrow.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.941
Dickham's gonna turn up the heat.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.944
I'm ready.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.820
I went and saw Mom today.

01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.260
Yeah?

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.500
Nice.

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.420
Where is she now?

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.100
Where...? Who?

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.260
Where's Mary? Do you think
there's something else? After we die?

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:11.031
You asking me if I believe in God?

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.505
Do you?

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.787
I'm 72 with Stage 4 cancer.
What choice do I have?

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:22.421
You know...

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.780
I was gonna say that...

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:30.144
I was gonna apologize
for belittling your marriage.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.144
It's not easy to have a good marriage.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.460
I don't know what to do.
What would you do?

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.264
Lisa and all.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.140
I don't know, Henry. I truly don't.

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.786
You think you can make each other
happy again?

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.589
Fill it up.

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.502
I have a little toast here.

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.780
To whatever, I don't know.
But let's have a toast.

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.347
- To good luck in court.
- Good luck.

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:32.660
The judge's Cadillac reappears in the
frame five minutes after he left the lot.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.510
Exact time, sheriff?

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.140
Four minutes, 45 seconds.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.469
Okay, again. When he leaves.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.904
Went too far.

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.347
There we go.

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.661
Judge Palmer?

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.740
Dad.

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.580
Bailiff, you mind calling an ambulance?

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.340
Dad, talk to us.

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.380
Dad?

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:34.860
Saint Thomas Moore. I don't know
which prayer card the judge would like.

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.980
Maybe Saint Joseph,
the patron saint of fathers...

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.060
Okay, okay, Dale.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.786
- ...and there's a Saint Joseph...
- Dial down the crazy.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.420
Wanna go to the vending machine?

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.224
- Okay.
- Here.

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.740
- Oh.
- Get whatever you want.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.705
- You have a naked lady in here.
- Yeah. It's a fun wallet.

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.910
Film the vending machines, Dale.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.580
Don't look at me like that. Don't do it.

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.260
Not now. Don't look at
me like that. Not now.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:15.103
You don't know what my life is like, okay?
Mom is gone. All right?

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.270
And Dad is...

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.300
And then what are we gonna do about Dale?
What, are you gonna help?

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.140
You? Really?

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.180
I haven't been stuck here.

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.780
I understand why you're going mental.

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.620
Hank, I've never asked
for a goddamn thing in your life.

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:32.740
- I'm fucking here.
- He's your father. You should be here.

01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.740
Oh, my God, you're nuts.

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:37.620
I never asked you for a goddamn thing.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.820
Okay? I'm asking you now.

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.660
You cannot lose this case.

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.181
Dad cannot go to prison.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.781
Don't pat me. Don't pat me.
I'm the big brother here. You don't pat me.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.340
Dad wants to see you, Hank.

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.110
Not you, Glen.

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.665
Come here.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.700
I killed the bastard.

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:25.060
You're funny.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.380
Don't ever say that again, to anybody.

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.700
I know me. I ran that man down.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.460
You're speculating. I know you too.

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:39.587
You're not capable of overriding
a lifetime of ethical superiority.

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:43.820
I don't have the energy
to fight with you, Henry.

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:45.380
Then muster some.

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.230
Do you remember hitting him?

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:49.620
Just a matter of time.

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.100
Clock's run out.

01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:54.429
We're out of fucking time.
You're not taking the stand.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:58.300
Then I'll fire you, and C.P. will do it.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:03.950
You are the most brutally
bullheaded client I've ever had.

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.260
This is easy. There's no witness.

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.300
The prosecution can't prove you hit him
any more than you can.

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:14.060
I've sprayed reasonable doubt all over
this case. Please, will you just...?

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.740
Let me do my job. Let me do the talking.
Keep your mouth shut, you'll win.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.980
Yes. But I have to live here.

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.060
You're impossible to defend.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.103
I'm...

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.740
What happened to Reagan?

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.466
You know, the jelly beans
and your horseshit legacy?

01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:41.940
Okay, so you're gonna swear in,
hand to God...

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:45.781
and lie under oath
that you remember hitting him?

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.260
I won't confess to something
I don't remember doing, okay?

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.780
- You promise? Thank you.
- Yes. Yes.

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.100
- I'll see you in court.
- I'm sorry. I just...

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.302
I'll see you in court.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.422
Judge Palmer.

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.860
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.791
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.991
I do.

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:13.860
You've been on the bench how long?

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.140
Forty-two years.

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.900
How many violent crimes
have you ruled on in that time?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.700
Objection. The defendant's history
as a judge is not relevant.

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.180
Your Honor, the state has introduced
evidence that suggests a motive...

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:28.860
for the alleged crime
related to the judge's duties.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:31.506
I'm entitled to rebut
that laughable presumption.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.585
Overruled.

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:37.671
It's not something I keep track of.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.180
Would it surprise you to learn...

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.180
that you presided over
17 murder trials...

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.460
434 assaults...

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:49.180
12,942 civil cases?

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.064
It would not.

01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:54.540
- Did you run over any of those folks?
- Objection.

01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:56.504
Rein it in, Mr. Palmer.

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.430
Just lost your wife?

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:05.220
- Yes.
- How long were you married?

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.024
Fifty years.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.900
How did she pass?

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.180
She spent the morning kneeling.

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:16.900
She fussed over her hydrangeas.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.700
A blood clot formed in her left leg...

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.789
and went to her heart.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:25.100
The day of the accident,
what did you do that morning?

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:28.420
I buried your mother... My wife.

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.782
Tough day. How did you feel?

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.900
Tired.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.260
Tired...

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.144
dark, raining.

01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.983
Do you remember hitting the victim?

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.821
I do not.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:43.706
Thank you.

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.745
Nothing further.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.700
Would it be fair to say
that you disliked Mark Blackwell?

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.231
Yes.

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.111
Wished him ill?

01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.745
I did.

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:02.425
Dead?

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.060
Yes.

01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:16.660
Deputy Hanson testified
that you told him...

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:19.140
that only you were allowed
to drive that car.

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.140
Not even your late wife.

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.940
It's my car.

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.620
But now a man's blood,
a man that you hate...

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.745
was found on a car that only you drive.

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.820
But you don't know how it got there.

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:34.660
I do not. No.

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:38.340
A six-foot-one, 220-pound man...

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:41.862
that's a pretty big old boy,
on a steel bicycle.

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.030
But you're in the dark about it all.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.300
Objection. Asked and answered.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.740
Overruled.

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:50.020
Correct.

01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:53.064
So on one of the worst
days of your life...

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.820
you enter the mini-mart...

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.340
you see a man you hate...

01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.144
Objection. Argumentative.

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.991
Let him finish.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.020
You see a man that you hate,
and minutes later...

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:07.300
you've altered your route...

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:12.020
and both you and that man
are on the same road at the same time...

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.349
only you're in your car
with his blood on it...

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:21.580
and he's in a ravine with his kidneys
ruptured and his back broken...

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.590
and you don't remember hitting him?

01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.265
I do not.

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.340
So you're telling this court...

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:35.101
under oath, which I know
you understand better than most...

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.740
that a man who killed somebody
on your watch...

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.988
a man you released...

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.228
who drowned a 16-year-old girl...

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.740
a man that you absolutely hate...

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:52.740
on the worst day of your life...

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:57.582
and you have the perfect opportunity
to balance the scales of justice...

01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:02.389
and your testimony is that you didn't
seize that chance and kill him.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:04.947
No.

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:12.751
No further questions.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.064
That's not my testimony.

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:36.100
Sir, how have I mischaracterized
your testimony?

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.984
Objection. He said no more questions.

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.506
Your Honor?

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.466
My testimony is...

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.460
that I don't remember hitting him.

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.140
Your Honor, may I
request a brief recess?

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.626
Denied.

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.509
Mr. Palmer...

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.663
Judge Palmer...

01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:10.060
do you think you killed
him intentionally?

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.184
Objection. Calls for speculation.
Move to strike.

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:16.660
Yes.

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:21.306
Order.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.626
Order, order! Settle down.

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.141
Thank you, Your Honor.
No further questions.

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.311
Redirect, judge?

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:49.541
Okay.

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:52.820
So you think you did it?

01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.020
- Correct.
- Okay. You think.

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.180
But not because you
remember hitting him.

01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:58.745
That's right.

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.540
No, your opinion is you
hit him on purpose.

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:04.820
- Correct?
- I just said yes.

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:07.148
Why do you think you can't remember?

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.069
My wife just died.

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.340
Undergoing any medical treatment?

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.180
Objection. Relevance?

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.508
- Goes to state of mind, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:20.300
You and I are finally done.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.660
- We're not done.
- We are.

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.660
- C.P., you're up.
- Sit down, Mr. Kennedy.

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.660
You're done when you answer me.

01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:28.300
- No, no, no.
- Answer it.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.580
- You're not my lawyer!
- You're a witness. Answer my question.

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:35.020
I'm of sound mind and body, and it's
none of your goddamn business...

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:37.700
- Sit down! I'm not done.
- None, none, none!

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:40.420
- Sit down!
- Gentlemen!

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.900
Judge Palmer.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.740
It's your right to seek other counsel
if you so choose.

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:49.626
But you'll have to do so
after you've completed your testimony.

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:52.909
Yes, sir.

01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.910
Undergoing any medical treatment?

01:52:58.360 --> 01:52:59.900
Yes or no?

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.100
Chemotherapy.

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.420
For how long?

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.420
Six months.

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:09.260
Chemo, that's cancer?

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.031
- Yes.
- Prognosis?

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.984
It's advanced.

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.580
Did your doctor caution you against the
potential side effects of chemotherapy?

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:23.942
- Yes, he did.
- What are they?

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:26.460
Nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite...

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:29.900
Delusions, fits of anger,
depression, memory loss?

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.460
Yeah, but none of that applies to me.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:33.740
Really?

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.460
What would happen to all the cases
you presided over...

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:39.780
if it were determined that your
mental actuality was diminished?

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:42.620
Objection.
Counsel is trying to prejudice the jury.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:45.700
- Overruled.
- All those trials...

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:48.980
they would be declared mistrials,
would they not?

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:50.940
Potentially, yes.

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.140
A stain on your reputation.

01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.460
You'd do anything to avoid that,
would you not?

01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:59.585
- No, no, no!
- Then why don't you remember...

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:03.342
seeing Blackwell that night?

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.588
I remember him. I just don't recall...

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:11.105
hitting that son of a bitch.

01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:13.344
What do you remember?

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:17.020
I remember he...

01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.700
opened his disgusting mouth.

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.302
What could he possibly have said?

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.549
Hey, judge.

01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:44.587
Sorry to hear about your wife.

01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:46.906
You know...

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:51.824
she ain't buried
more than 50 feet from Hope.

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.583
I'm not gonna have to walk too far
to piss on both graves.

01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:14.549
He got them.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.670
No.

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.101
Doesn't add up.

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:33.546
I don't buy it. It can't be the first time
someone's insulted you. It's your job.

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:37.380
Why did you go easy
on him the first time?

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.311
Of all the judges in Indiana,
the one with the tightest...

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.540
You gave him 30 days.

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:46.580
He threatened her,
discharged a firearm at her residence.

01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:49.140
That's six months. A year.

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:50.420
Easy.

01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.429
What was your reasoning?

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.780
A hundred and 80 days, that's solid.
Maybe he'd have cooled off.

01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:00.302
Maybe he doesn't kill Hope.
Maybe we're not here.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.420
Of all the years you
sat on that bench...

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.940
all the people that stood before you,
the leniency...

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:10.940
the understanding, the free ride
goes to Mark Blackwell?

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.507
How do you explain
that lapse in judgment?

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:23.742
I looked at him and saw you.

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:29.060
Same willful disobedience...

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:32.025
same recklessness.

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:37.026
I looked at him and saw my middle son.

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.425
My little boy.

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.388
My little boy.

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:49.300
I watched him cry right there.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:54.711
I wanted to put my arms around him
and tell him it didn't have to be like this.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.980
I wanted someone to help him...

01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:01.468
like I'd want someone to help my boy...

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.388
if he lost his way.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:17.025
It was my chance to be...

01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:21.820
that someone. Is that so much to ask?

01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:24.546
- Maybe so. Maybe so.
- I have memories.

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:29.020
Of us.

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:30.221
You, me.

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:34.144
Then I don't.

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.507
How come?

01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:42.350
Why?

01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:44.506
Why?

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:47.425
Why?

01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:52.823
I looked at you and I saw him.

01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:01.581
Your Honor,
may the deputy please approach?

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:13.785
Last question: This man's been your
bailiff for 22 years. What is his name?

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.351
Gus.

01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:28.390
You don't know?

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:37.588
I'd like to go home now, okay?

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:43.147
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.661
Hey.

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:07.902
- You okay?
- I don't know.

01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.309
Depends on the verdict.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.547
I'm Carla's dad, right?

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.300
This again?

01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:21.740
Why can't you just let it go?

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.465
- She's fine.
- Of course she is.

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:26.460
She was born nine months after I split.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:29.460
Either that or you cheated on me.
Either way, it's not fine.

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:32.300
One version is slightly less not fine
than the other.

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:35.504
And the thing is... Listen.

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.660
God, this is ugly.

01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:41.860
Here it is. I met Carla
at the tavern. Blind.

01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:44.500
Okay? I'm there with Dale and Glen, and...

01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:46.623
He's her father.

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:50.301
- He who's her father?
- Yeah, Glen doesn't know.

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.500
Not my... My brother?

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:55.100
- It was just the one time...
- Glen? That fucker?

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.900
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.340
- Glen?
- You left!

01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:00.620
Fuck off! I went to a Metallica concert.

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:02.100
And you never came back!

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:06.580
He was broken, he was sweet, he was
almost normal. I needed a little normal.

02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:08.700
That makes me what?

02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:12.063
A more superior prick
who never shit between two shoes.

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.540
Damn it, Hank.

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:18.062
I loved you then
and I love you now. I do.

02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:21.380
I love how you are simultaneously...

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:25.420
the most selfish
and the most generous person I know.

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:29.545
I love how you hate a bully
while you're being one.

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:35.544
But your constant second-guessing
of others, that crystal-ball bullshit?

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:42.220
That hyper-verbal vocabulary-vomit thing
that you do.

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:45.071
I disappeared around you, Hank.

02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.744
Say it again.

02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:57.744
All of it?

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:30.106
Yep.

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:33.704
Jury entering. All rise.

02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:44.781
Be seated.

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.981
Mr. Foreman, have you reached a verdict?

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.340
We have, Your Honor.

02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:01.260
What say you in the matter of
the State of Indiana v. Joseph Palmer...

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.906
on the charge of murder
in the first degree?

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:07.940
We find the defendant not guilty.

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.103
And on the lesser included charge
of voluntary manslaughter?

02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:23.780
We find the defendant guilty.

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.631
Order.

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.225
Move for sentencing, Your Honor.

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:44.300
This case has been a most
tragic occurrence...

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.062
as I am required
to impose an appropriate sentence.

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:52.780
But as you know all too well, sir...

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:54.220
that is the job.

02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:58.860
I am therefore sentencing you
to serve four years in state prison.

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:02.180
Sentence is to begin forthwith.

02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.100
Deputy, please take Judge Palmer
into custody.

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.387
Order.

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:20.428
Dad? Dad?

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.989
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Dad.

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:30.101
I've always been proud of you.
Always will be.

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:33.380
- Yeah.
- Always will be.

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:36.060
- Come here. Say goodbye to Dad.
- Come here.

02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:40.380
Listen to me.
You're a strong man, not a boy, okay?

02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:43.709
I need you to look after your brother
for me. Now, can you do that?

02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.900
- Okay?
- Okay, Dad.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.780
And this camera.
I know it's a buffer for you.

02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:51.380
Use it.

02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:53.820
- But you don't need it. Okay?
- Okay, Dad.

02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:55.465
Okay.

02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:20.940
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
thank you for your service.

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:22.500
You're excused.

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:24.225
This court is adjourned.

02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:29.345
- Do we expect an appeal?
- No.

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:32.260
Ninety percent of the country
believes in ghosts...

02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:34.827
less than a third in evolution.

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:37.340
Thirty-five percent can...

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:40.820
correctly identify Homer Simpson
and the town in which he resides.

02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:43.626
Less than 1 percent knows
the name Thurgood Marshall.

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:49.428
But when you put 12 Americans together
on a jury and you ask for justice...

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:53.224
something just south of brilliance
happens.

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:57.704
Often as not, they get it right.

02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:02.700
You know...

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:08.500
six weeks we prepped Burke's mistress
for the infamous Hank Palmer cross.

02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:12.140
And you went easy on her.

02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:13.910
I did?

02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:17.060
Might cost you your job.

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:20.460
Well, you know, when you lose...

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:23.027
you lose.

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:27.580
And when you're on a streak,
you know, you just...

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.589
stick with it.

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:46.786
Sign here and here to take possession.

02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:29.869
You look good. You warm enough?

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.460
- Yeah.
- Too warm?

02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:34.220
Knock it off.

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.669
Glen and Dale stopped for more bait.

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:44.860
- Remember you used to bring these home?
- Yeah. Give me some.

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:46.780
- Here.
- Give me some to take home too.

02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:50.420
- There you go.
- You little gremlins, you inhaled these.

02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:53.500
- Remember? Inhaled them.
- Sure.

02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:56.180
Till Dale jerked a filling out,
ruined it for everybody.

02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:57.620
Yeah.

02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:00.780
Your mother nailed me for it.

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:02.300
Fucking Dale.

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:06.740
He's the greatest.

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.670
- Want some water?
- No.

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:15.980
Remember what you'd say
if you thought I had one on me?

02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:18.460
"Where my Bit O' Honey, old man?"

02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:22.670
- Worked every time.
- Yeah.

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:28.631
You are.

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:31.260
- I am? What?
- Yeah.

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:35.181
Question you asked me
about best lawyer and all?

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.751
You picked the fella you work with.

02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:44.664
I choose you.

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:08.470
You know...

02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:12.423
Glen could've really been something.

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.060
No doubt about it.

02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:18.024
Yeah.

02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.710
Yep.

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:32.071
Five bucks I catch a sunfish before you.

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:40.104
Feeling lucky.

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:46.660
Come on, come on.

02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:47.941
That's nothing.

02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:01.305
Dad?

02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:04.071
Dad?

02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:34.740
Close your eyes.

02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:36.980
Green, orange. Go. Close your eyes.

02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:40.860
One, two, three.
Closing, closing, closing.

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.422
You didn't make it.

02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:52.026
Thanks for doing this. It's nice.

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:04.785
I'm gonna close the place early tonight.

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:11.382
If you wanna come by around,
I don't know, 9-ish, let's say...

02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:14.340
I'll save a piece of pie for you.

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:30.186
- Where you going?
- Get some air.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.340
Hey.

02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:39.380
I just wanted to, you know,
have a moment before you run out.

02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:42.390
- Just gonna get some air.
- I know, but you disappear.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.545
I just wanna...

02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:19.061
Palmer, you asshole!

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:21.260
I'm right here!

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.349
I'm from here!
