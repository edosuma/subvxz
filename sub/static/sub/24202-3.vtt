WEBVTT

00:01.906 --> 00:05.204
We're pulling the plug. The on-duty
parent will live in the main house.

00:05.210 --> 00:07.284
The off-duty parent will
be living in the garage.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.195
You want to blame everything
on Lena when, in fact,

00:09.201 --> 00:10.892
you didn't dance with
your wife at your wedding.

00:10.898 --> 00:12.531
I didn't dance with
her at our wedding.

00:12.537 --> 00:14.281
- That's what you think our problem was?
- Kind of.

00:14.287 --> 00:15.797
Now, remember. The
most important rule

00:15.803 --> 00:17.983
about dancing has nothing
to do with dancing.

00:17.989 --> 00:20.977
If you don't keep me in
your gaze, I might get lost.

00:20.983 --> 00:23.667
You just explained
why my marriage failed.

00:23.673 --> 00:25.781
I want to be with
someone who's into me.

00:25.787 --> 00:27.043
I'm someone's mother.

00:27.049 --> 00:29.892
Motherhood and
sexuality can't coexist?

00:31.668 --> 00:34.058
Crazy part is, I've
seen you wipe things.

00:34.064 --> 00:37.083
I've witnessed it
happening. Didn't take.

00:37.425 --> 00:40.659
- There's always this filmy residue.
- O-kay.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.143
That's me. I'm the residue guy.

00:43.149 --> 00:44.354
And you always will be

00:44.360 --> 00:46.448
till you learn how to wipe
harder, like you mean it.

00:46.454 --> 00:47.658
I mean it!

00:47.664 --> 00:50.561
- I mean, I meant it when I wiped it.
- No, you didn't.

00:51.036 --> 00:53.057
Watch. Learn.

00:53.908 --> 00:55.504
- Ooh.
- Oh. wow.

00:55.510 --> 00:57.302
- Did you see that follow-through?
- Ooh!

00:58.414 --> 01:00.495
Man, I don't think
I've ever wiped anything

01:00.501 --> 01:02.000
with that much commitment.

01:03.486 --> 01:07.330
But I promise that I will
wipe harder next time.

01:07.336 --> 01:08.536
That's all I ask.

01:12.219 --> 01:13.518
So, it's kind of fun

01:13.524 --> 01:16.229
that we're both single
at the same time, right?

01:16.235 --> 01:17.435
Yeah.

01:18.129 --> 01:20.936
Maybe we could do some fun...

01:21.136 --> 01:24.036
- single sister things together.
- _

01:24.042 --> 01:25.746
_

01:25.847 --> 01:27.753
- "Wok of Shame."
- Single men,

01:27.759 --> 01:29.555
imitation Crab Rangoon.

01:30.433 --> 01:31.949
- You in?
- I don't know, Maya.

01:31.955 --> 01:34.442
Both those things sound kinda...

01:34.839 --> 01:36.754
- sad?
- Oh, they are.

01:37.566 --> 01:39.667
Well, what happened to
that guy you met on Tinder?

01:39.673 --> 01:40.873
Rudy?

01:44.538 --> 01:46.735
Maya! Maya!

01:46.829 --> 01:48.556
Ah. Ah.

01:50.587 --> 01:52.090
Forgot your phone charger.

01:52.697 --> 01:54.698
I could've just
gotten it next time.

01:54.894 --> 01:57.909
Y-Yeah. Um, about that...

01:58.799 --> 02:01.001
Are you (BLEEP) kidding me, Rudy?

02:01.327 --> 02:02.960
And it's not just Rudy.

02:02.966 --> 02:05.457
I mean, every guy,
really, is the worst.

02:05.463 --> 02:07.357
So will you please come
with me to this thing

02:07.363 --> 02:09.340
so then maybe we could
meet some more of them?

02:09.346 --> 02:10.835
The thing is, Maya, that I...

02:10.841 --> 02:12.862
I kind of already
met someone I like.

02:12.868 --> 02:14.638
You already met someone you like?

02:16.748 --> 02:18.169
There's two guys on here.

02:18.175 --> 02:20.050
Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Not the doctor.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.154
The hot young guy, Wes.

02:24.154 --> 02:25.966
Oh. I know what this is.

02:26.263 --> 02:28.276
Uh, Lena...

02:28.282 --> 02:30.263
sometimes really ugly people

02:30.269 --> 02:32.570
use photos of really
not-ugly people

02:32.576 --> 02:34.259
to just try to lure you in.

02:34.662 --> 02:36.762
That's actually how I met Rudy.

02:36.768 --> 02:38.971
- Are you talking about...
- You're being catfished.

02:38.977 --> 02:41.742
- I'm not being catfished.
- Said everyone on the show "Catfish."

02:41.748 --> 02:43.577
I'm not on the show "Catfish,"

02:43.583 --> 02:46.678
and I didn't meet either of
those guys on an app or online.

02:46.684 --> 02:49.845
- I met them in person.
- You mean in... real life?

02:49.851 --> 02:51.687
Yeah. And the doctor is nice.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.312
I just... I feel like I have

02:53.318 --> 02:55.390
more sexual chemistry
with the young guy.

02:55.396 --> 02:57.687
- Oh, sexual chemistry.
- Yeah. And it's like he...

02:57.693 --> 03:00.109
definitely takes me
outside of my comfort zone.

03:00.115 --> 03:01.315
Oh.

03:01.321 --> 03:04.246
So, you've been single
for like 14 seconds,

03:04.252 --> 03:07.463
and you've already been
outside of your comfort zone?

03:07.736 --> 03:10.162
Well, not all the way
outside of my comfort zone.

03:10.477 --> 03:12.680
That's kind of what I was
hoping to do next weekend.

03:12.686 --> 03:14.398

03:44.641 --> 03:46.187
Did you say "syphilis"?

03:46.193 --> 03:48.062
- Syphilis.
- Syphilis.

03:48.068 --> 03:49.637
Syphilis. It's an STD.

03:49.740 --> 03:52.476
Thank you, Jules. I
know that it's an STD.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.751
Um, I just didn't know
that anyone still got it

03:54.757 --> 03:56.948
except for
17th-century courtesans.

03:56.954 --> 04:00.331
Why would anyone think they're
so great for having syphilis?

04:00.337 --> 04:03.257
Well, because the girl
he says he got it from

04:03.352 --> 04:05.758
- is Brooke Benaroche.
- Brooke Benaroche?

04:05.764 --> 04:07.360
Brooke Benaroche is the
hottest girl in school.

04:07.366 --> 04:09.151
She has a tattoo of
Ganesh on her pelvis.

04:09.157 --> 04:11.868
Ganesh is an elephant. Kind
of like Babar, but Hindu.

04:12.149 --> 04:13.610

Thank you so much.

04:13.616 --> 04:15.388

04:15.394 --> 04:17.024
you are wearing the hell
out of those sweatpants.

04:17.029 --> 04:19.923
Okay. Do you see that? That's
why half of you have syphilis.

04:19.928 --> 04:22.000
Mom, relax. None
of us have syphilis.

04:22.007 --> 04:24.220
Yeah, I mean, Mason hasn't
even frenched a girl,

04:24.226 --> 04:25.924
so y-you really got
nothing to worry about.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.135

04:27.141 --> 04:29.343
Oh, okay. All right. Yuk it up.

04:29.421 --> 04:31.223
But, uh, homey's
onto something here,

04:31.229 --> 04:35.090
because the only way to avoid
a nasty STD like syphilis

04:35.096 --> 04:36.823
is by being abstinent.

04:37.216 --> 04:40.321
- Like my killer here, Mason.
- Okay, oh, Mom, you're not helping.

04:40.521 --> 04:42.320
Okay. Come on, guys. Let's go.

04:42.326 --> 04:44.812
All right, well, if you do
smash, wrap it up, gents.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.919
Wrap it up. All right?

04:46.925 --> 04:48.459

You, sir, are a dancer.

- Yeah.

05:37.051 --> 05:38.375
You're really good.

05:39.107 --> 05:40.307
Well, damn.

05:41.158 --> 05:43.668
We did it. Here.

05:44.181 --> 05:45.596
You know, it's funny.

05:46.564 --> 05:49.946
When we first started
lessons, you know, I thought...

05:49.952 --> 05:51.347
You had some kind of disability?

05:51.353 --> 05:52.729
Yeah, I know. I
thought the same thing.

05:52.735 --> 05:53.940
No.

05:53.946 --> 05:55.939
No, I-I actually...

05:58.243 --> 06:00.068
I actually thought
something different.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.133
When we first started,

06:02.139 --> 06:04.141
you know, I thought I
was just doing this to...

06:05.852 --> 06:08.729
I don't know... prove
something to myself, you know?

06:08.735 --> 06:11.453
But then after spending these
past few weeks with you...

06:12.716 --> 06:15.042
I realize that, uh...

06:15.822 --> 06:17.652
I'm not doing this for me.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.057
- No?
- No.

06:21.205 --> 06:22.752
I'm doing it for her.

06:23.721 --> 06:25.565
For her. Right.

06:26.388 --> 06:28.985
I mean, what if I had done
this before we got married?

06:29.584 --> 06:31.874
What if I had danced
with her at our wedding?

06:31.880 --> 06:34.755
Maybe it would have changed the
entire course of our marriage.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.804
So, what, you think one
dance with your ex-wife

06:36.810 --> 06:38.683
is gonna erase all
of your problems?

06:39.081 --> 06:41.198
Well, you said I
was a good dancer.

06:42.479 --> 06:44.777
I said you were a dancer.

06:45.081 --> 06:46.488
You said I was a great dancer.

06:46.494 --> 06:48.733
- I said a dancer.
- Mm-hmm.

06:50.318 --> 06:52.413
Why do we have to wear
these matching hats?

06:52.419 --> 06:55.130
- They're anti-aging.
- I feel like we're in "The Handmaid's Tale."

06:55.258 --> 06:57.239
So, wait. Martin
has a girlfriend?!

06:57.245 --> 06:58.445
It would appear that way.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.423
Same girl sneaking
into the garage again.

07:01.612 --> 07:03.343
Oh, my God. How are
you guys talking?

07:03.349 --> 07:06.054
- This is practically vertical.
- I'm gonna kill him.

07:06.437 --> 07:08.712
It's okay. Whatever.
I'm dating, too.

07:08.718 --> 07:11.140
No, I'm talking about Arthur.
Martin has a girlfriend,

07:11.146 --> 07:13.725
- and that little (BLEEP) didn't tell me?
- You know what I realized?

07:13.731 --> 07:16.439
Tomorrow was gonna be
our 16-year anniversary.

07:16.445 --> 07:18.157
He's already in a relationship!

07:18.163 --> 07:21.024
Okay. Meanwhile, I'm gonna
die here on these steps

07:21.030 --> 07:22.524
childless and alone.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.240
Ugh! Maya!

07:24.342 --> 07:26.531
If you want to have children, why
don't you stop whining about it

07:26.537 --> 07:27.741
and just have some?

07:27.747 --> 07:30.040
It's 2018. There
are ways, you know?

07:30.046 --> 07:32.037
- Artificial insemination.
- Adoption.

07:32.043 --> 07:33.344
Amazon Prime.

07:34.445 --> 07:35.995
No. Watch, you
guys. It will happen.

07:36.001 --> 07:38.778
I don't know if I could
have a kid all by myself.

07:38.784 --> 07:40.598
I can't even make
it up these steps.

07:40.604 --> 07:42.797
Well, I think you'd be
a kick-ass single mom.

07:43.106 --> 07:44.873
You can practice on
my kids if you want.

07:44.879 --> 07:46.794
Now, that is a good idea.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.264
You babysit her kids.

07:48.270 --> 07:50.246
Martin is dating,
so you're dating.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.996
Okay. Screw it. Maya, are you in?

07:53.002 --> 07:54.591
- I'm texting Wes.
- I'm in.

07:54.597 --> 07:57.567
But promise me that you're gonna
have sex and not just dinner.

07:57.573 --> 07:59.163
I mean, it depends on
what we have for dinner.

07:59.169 --> 08:01.040
I mean, if it's like,
something with Alfredo...

08:01.046 --> 08:02.763
No! No Alfredo!

08:02.769 --> 08:05.366
She needs a UTI by first light.

08:05.372 --> 08:07.251
Okay. It's been a very long time

08:07.257 --> 08:09.056
since I've been with
anyone other than Martin.

08:09.062 --> 08:10.562
You know, though, as I recall,

08:10.568 --> 08:13.243
you haven't been with Martin
in a long time, either.

08:13.249 --> 08:15.190
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

08:15.196 --> 08:17.478
I mean, what will I wear?
What will we even talk about?

08:17.778 --> 08:19.300
Don't talk about your kids.

08:19.306 --> 08:20.886
Oh, my God. I'm not
gonna talk about my kids.

08:20.892 --> 08:23.269
He doesn't want to hear
about kids. He is a kid.

08:23.275 --> 08:26.994
Ohh. He's so young
and cool and edgy.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.489
Like The Fonz.

08:28.495 --> 08:31.610
- Oh, my God. The Fonz is like 100.
- Oh.

08:36.298 --> 08:37.498
You okay?

08:37.504 --> 08:39.291
Who, me? I'm great!

08:39.297 --> 08:40.496
But if my battery dies,

08:40.503 --> 08:43.412
I'll definitely have to call an
Uber, 'cause this is a long run.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.213
A real long run!

08:45.723 --> 08:49.017
Hey. Hop off that thing. I-I
want to show you something.

08:49.023 --> 08:50.223
Something gross?

08:50.229 --> 08:51.523
What? No.

08:51.529 --> 08:53.212
No. No. I-I...

08:54.531 --> 08:57.441
I got a gift for Lena, and I-I
want to know what you think.

08:57.447 --> 08:58.939
Come on. Get off the hover board.

08:59.423 --> 09:00.623
Come here.

09:01.955 --> 09:05.189
This is a little weird. And
yet, I've never felt safer.

09:06.642 --> 09:09.504
♪ One, two, three,
one, two, three ♪

09:09.671 --> 09:11.761
- Did you learn to dance?! Okay.
- Get closer.

09:11.767 --> 09:13.756
You did! You learned to dance!

09:13.762 --> 09:15.411
- Stop fighting me so much!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

09:16.299 --> 09:17.861
Hey! We're dancing!

09:19.959 --> 09:22.259
- Dude, when did this happen?
- A while ago.

09:22.265 --> 09:24.467
And then seeing her the
other night all dressed up,

09:24.473 --> 09:26.950
you know, getting excited to
go out with some other dude,

09:26.956 --> 09:29.553
- it... it just got me...
- Shook?

09:29.559 --> 09:31.546
- Shook. Yeah, I got shook.
- Yeah.

09:31.552 --> 09:33.445
Hey. Listen to me.
You promise me...

09:33.451 --> 09:36.034
Promise me that you're not gonna
say anything about this to Camille.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.456
- What? Why?
- Dude.

09:37.462 --> 09:39.661
She doesn't let me keep
secrets. Those are the rules.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.531
One dessert, no secrets.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.378
If you tell Camille, she will
tell Lena and... and then ruin it.

09:44.847 --> 09:46.458
She will ruin it.

09:46.464 --> 09:48.728
Tomorrow would've been our
16-year wedding anniversary,

09:48.734 --> 09:50.327
and I have made a decision.

09:51.796 --> 09:53.612
I want to fix things with Lena.

10:00.985 --> 10:02.185
Oh, hey, guys.

10:02.191 --> 10:04.254
What's up, cherry-boy?
Still living in Palmdale?

10:06.035 --> 10:08.921
Don't listen to them,
cherry-boy. Those kids are jerks.

10:09.421 --> 10:11.101
Oh. Hi, Hazel.

10:14.225 --> 10:17.388
It's like, "God, math.
Why don't you just grow up

10:17.394 --> 10:19.077
and solve your own
problems?" Am I right?

10:19.083 --> 10:21.359
Pick me up tonight in an
Uber, and I'll french you.

10:21.365 --> 10:23.678
- What?!
- If it's an uberX, just frenching.

10:23.684 --> 10:25.794
If it's a BLACK car,
you might get to second.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.201
And if it's an
uberPOOL, deal's off.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.353
W-what if it's
during surge pricing?!

10:38.540 --> 10:40.542
What if your baby
refuses the breast?

10:40.548 --> 10:42.360
I... offer a bottle.

10:42.366 --> 10:43.931
What if your baby
doesn't want the bottle?

10:43.937 --> 10:46.237
Yeah. What if your baby
only wants a Snapple?

10:46.861 --> 10:49.572
- Call a pediatrician?
- Or...?

10:49.578 --> 10:51.084
Give the baby the Snapple?

10:51.090 --> 10:52.369
That's what I'd do.

10:54.166 --> 10:55.575
What's the matter, Mace?

10:55.581 --> 10:57.475
You don't want to play
"What if Your Baby"?

10:57.481 --> 10:58.695
Fine.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.057
What if your baby

11:01.150 --> 11:04.064
was the only baby who had
never hooked up with anyone,

11:04.261 --> 11:06.458
and all of your baby's
friends always tease your baby

11:06.464 --> 11:07.951
and called your
baby "cherry-boy"?

11:07.957 --> 11:10.651
So your baby made plans to
make out with a girl named Hazel

11:10.657 --> 11:12.268
from math class in a sex Uber,

11:12.274 --> 11:14.242
and now your baby
very much regrets it?!

11:14.248 --> 11:16.526
Whoa. Your baby's awesome!

11:16.532 --> 11:21.295
Hey! My baby doesn't need
to prove anything to anyone.

11:21.301 --> 11:22.955
Yes, your baby does!

11:22.961 --> 11:24.808
Milo. Go get a snack.

11:26.496 --> 11:27.945
_

11:28.264 --> 11:29.694
Sex Uber?

11:29.700 --> 11:31.106
Mason, no.

11:31.562 --> 11:33.784
First of all,
we're a Lyft family.

11:34.071 --> 11:35.880
I think I'm just gonna no-show.

11:35.886 --> 11:39.096
Okay, uh, I know why
you're saying that. But...

11:39.197 --> 11:40.785
listen. You just gotta...

11:40.791 --> 11:43.239
you gotta think about how
that girl is gonna feel.

11:43.245 --> 11:46.473
Great. My driver, Amir,
4.8 stars, is now arriving.

11:46.479 --> 11:47.679
Okay. Listen.

11:47.685 --> 11:49.117
If you don't like this girl,

11:49.123 --> 11:51.671
you don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

11:52.144 --> 11:55.648
But you can't stand her
up. Just let her down easy.

12:00.655 --> 12:02.982
Wow. Great job, Aunt Maya.

12:03.841 --> 12:06.591
See? Maybe I-I can do
the kid thing on my own.

12:06.597 --> 12:07.797
Yeah.

12:07.803 --> 12:11.348
You just sent a 14-year-old out
for a sexcapade on a school night.

12:11.354 --> 12:13.763
And I'm not supposed
to be drinking this.

12:21.989 --> 12:23.286
I like your beanie.

12:24.092 --> 12:26.203
- I'm taking it off.
- Don't.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.410
Did you wear it for me?

12:29.059 --> 12:30.477
No, I did not.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.930
- It feels like you wore it for me.
- Nope.

12:32.936 --> 12:35.042
Wrong. I wear this
beanie all the time.

12:35.048 --> 12:36.346
Right.

12:37.101 --> 12:40.281
- Did you borrow it from your son?
- Stop it!

12:41.398 --> 12:43.400
Oh, so I guess we don't
have to worry about

12:43.406 --> 12:45.713
finding a table,
because there aren't any.

12:45.719 --> 12:48.013
No need for a table. You'll
be done eating in 30 seconds

12:48.019 --> 12:50.308
- after he hands it to you.
- It's funny that you think I'm eating this.

12:50.314 --> 12:52.497
Oh, you are
absolutely eating this.

12:52.503 --> 12:54.897
I know we're just kind of
getting to know each other,

12:54.903 --> 12:56.192
- Uh-huh.
- but you should be made aware...

12:56.198 --> 12:58.308
meat that comes
from one of those...

12:58.314 --> 13:00.778
slathered in sauce
from one of those,

13:00.784 --> 13:05.722
served in one of these is
never going inside of this.

13:05.909 --> 13:08.964
Oh, first of all,
that is not just meat.

13:08.970 --> 13:10.272
That is Al pastor.

13:10.278 --> 13:13.482
Okay, it's meat that has
had his fingers in it.

13:13.488 --> 13:14.959
Oh, you want those
fingers in there.

13:14.965 --> 13:17.257
I mean, those fingers are
responsible for half the taste.

13:17.263 --> 13:20.398
If I could lick each and every
one of those fingers, I would.

13:23.171 --> 13:25.272
- ÿQué van a ordenar?
- Dos Al pastor.

13:25.603 --> 13:27.515
Y dedos extras, por favor.

13:29.149 --> 13:31.588
That's "extra
fingers" in Spanish.

13:31.594 --> 13:33.493
Got it. Okay.

13:34.412 --> 13:35.711
Gracias.

13:36.217 --> 13:38.419
How do you say
"gloves" in Spanish?

13:40.908 --> 13:43.533
Okay. Don't be mad.
I'm so sorry. I just...

13:43.539 --> 13:46.314
I-I-I-I am not a "street
meat" kind of girl.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.409
Well, maybe you are a
"street meat" kind of girl

13:48.415 --> 13:49.894
and you just don't know it yet.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.228
I don't think so.

13:51.234 --> 13:52.434
All right. Come on.

13:52.793 --> 13:54.414
One tiny bite?

13:56.509 --> 13:58.332

you'd be eating street meat

14:27.852 --> 14:29.348
and making out in a parking lot.

14:29.354 --> 14:31.651
Yeah, well, we're not
exactly making out.

such short notice. I can pay you.

I'm nervous.

15:05.216 --> 15:07.127

really nervous.

everything that we've worked on.

forward? Is it left foot back?

okay? Don't overthink it.

but, TBH, I'm just not ready.

17:02.539 --> 17:04.704
I was just tired of being
the only kid at school

17:04.711 --> 17:06.930
who hadn't hooked
up with someone.
