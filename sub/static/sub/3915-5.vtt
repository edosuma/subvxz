00:00.143 --> 00:01.644
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>Beauty & the Beast...</i>

00:01.745 --> 00:04.185
You think we should close the window?
Why?

00:04.186 --> 00:05.386
Because we are no closer

00:05.487 --> 00:07.121
to figuring out
who's behind all this,

00:07.222 --> 00:09.490
which means Bob
and Carol are still out there.

00:09.591 --> 00:11.258
(groans) Bob and Carol?
Yes.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.994
VINCENT:
<i>Superhuman</i>

00:13.095 --> 00:14.462
assassins.
Yes.

00:14.563 --> 00:16.230
Who's behind these experiments?

00:16.331 --> 00:17.971
Oh, you really think
you're gonna stop us?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.301
(grunting)

00:21.370 --> 00:23.604
(grunts, gasps)
(sighs)

00:23.705 --> 00:26.440
(growling)

00:26.541 --> 00:27.541
(beeping)

00:29.344 --> 00:32.313
CAROL: <i>Wait. We might need her</i>
<i>alive to help us catch him.</i>

00:32.414 --> 00:34.415
Look, this isn't just a cleanup
job anymore, this is about

00:34.516 --> 00:37.351
saving our asses. We can't
go back there empty-handed.

00:37.452 --> 00:38.853
You know what codependency is?
CATHERINE: Codep...

00:38.954 --> 00:40.154
Codependency?
Yeah, uh, it's, uh...

00:40.255 --> 00:41.922
You lose yourself
in the relationship.

00:42.024 --> 00:43.290
Frankly,

00:43.392 --> 00:45.059
that's what
the underlying issue is here.

00:55.804 --> 00:58.939
Did you get those concert tickets yet?
Concert tickets?

00:59.041 --> 01:00.374
I'm still
working on it.

01:00.475 --> 01:02.309
Oh. What else
are you working on, hmm?

01:02.411 --> 01:04.211
Maybe things that go bump
in the night?

01:04.312 --> 01:05.813
Okay, give me a break.

01:05.914 --> 01:08.549
Yeah, should I call the marriage
counselor now or later?

01:08.650 --> 01:10.618
After two years of
defining ourselves mostly

01:10.719 --> 01:13.287
by whatever those things are,
it's hard to break the habit.

01:13.388 --> 01:15.156
Especially when
there are still

01:15.257 --> 01:17.892
superhuman assassins
out there after us.

01:17.993 --> 01:20.661
Catherine, come on, it's been
weeks since Bob and Carol tried

01:20.762 --> 01:21.377
to attack us, right?

01:21.401 --> 01:23.130
Yeah, they didn't try
to attack us, Vincent.

01:23.131 --> 01:25.199
They tried to kill us, and just
because it's been a while,

01:25.300 --> 01:27.635
it doesn't mean
that they're...

01:27.736 --> 01:29.870
I'm doing it again, aren't I?

01:29.971 --> 01:32.473
Yes, you are, but you-you caught
yourself. That's awesome.

01:32.574 --> 01:34.475
I know. Thank you.
Still, we can't just

01:34.576 --> 01:36.043
ignore the fact that there are
people still experimenting

01:36.144 --> 01:37.411
on innocents out there, can we?

01:37.512 --> 01:39.146
Oh, we can't just let

01:39.247 --> 01:41.549
the world's great evils keep
overwhelming our lives

01:41.650 --> 01:43.417
all the time, either, okay?
Otherwise...

01:43.518 --> 01:45.086
We'll lose ourselves
along the way.

01:45.187 --> 01:48.656
Right, which is why
we need to learn to...

01:48.757 --> 01:50.257
break the cycle.

01:50.358 --> 01:52.059
Which is why we're gonna go

01:52.160 --> 01:53.861
our separate ways today, okay?
Doctor's orders.

01:53.962 --> 01:56.363
I get it.

01:56.465 --> 01:58.232
What are the rules again?
We can only

01:58.333 --> 02:01.202
text or call each other at
noon and late afternoon?

02:01.303 --> 02:03.003
I'm fine with noon.

02:03.105 --> 02:04.605
Late afternoon, I don't know
if I'll have cell reception.

02:04.706 --> 02:06.941
Cell reception?
Mm.

02:07.042 --> 02:08.375
Wait. You're going
upstate today?

02:08.477 --> 02:10.344
Is that a problem?
No.

02:10.445 --> 02:13.047
Okay, look, I-I love

02:13.148 --> 02:15.583
what the hospital is doing
with their outreach program,

02:15.684 --> 02:18.085
but you leaving the city?
What if something happens...

02:18.186 --> 02:20.855
to your car on the way?

02:20.956 --> 02:22.256
I love you, okay?

02:22.357 --> 02:24.125
Mmm. I should probably
hit the road.

02:24.226 --> 02:25.893
I'll be back
before for dinner, but...

02:25.994 --> 02:27.754
what time do you think you'll get...
Carol.

02:28.697 --> 02:31.932
...off?

02:33.201 --> 02:35.803
(sighs)
Here we go again.

02:35.904 --> 02:38.973
(groans, sighs)

02:42.244 --> 02:43.310
Hey!

02:43.411 --> 02:46.280
(horn blares, tires squeal)

02:52.254 --> 02:55.222
Do you know how many blonde
women there are in Manhattan?

02:55.323 --> 02:57.663
Okay, but you have to admit
that could have been Carol.

02:57.687 --> 02:58.359
Along with

02:58.360 --> 03:00.461
the other three random blondes
that you thought were her, too.

03:00.562 --> 03:03.497
I know. Codependency or not, Bob
and Carol are still out there,

03:03.598 --> 03:05.266
and if they catch
us off guard...

03:05.367 --> 03:07.668
They won't. Besides,
if I remember correctly,

03:07.769 --> 03:09.503
we're pretty good at kicking ass
on our own, if we have to.

03:09.604 --> 03:10.938
What if you have
to go primal,

03:11.039 --> 03:12.640
and I'm not there
to pull you back?

03:12.741 --> 03:14.675
You can't save yourself.
Catherine,

03:14.776 --> 03:16.343
that's the whole reason
we went to counseling.

03:16.444 --> 03:18.979
You needing to save me,

03:19.080 --> 03:21.482
my needing your love
to control my inner beast.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.184
Okay, if we keep
living in fear

03:23.285 --> 03:24.618
of the worst case scenario

03:24.719 --> 03:26.921
happening every time
we're apart,

03:27.022 --> 03:28.382
we'll never break
our codependency.

03:28.456 --> 03:30.024
Come on, repeat after me:

03:30.125 --> 03:34.128
Everything is okay.
I am okay.

03:34.229 --> 03:36.597
Everything is okay.
I am okay.

03:36.698 --> 03:38.799
TESS:
<i>You are so not okay, Cat.</i>

03:38.900 --> 03:40.534
I thought the whole point
of therapy was

03:40.635 --> 03:42.937
to redefine yourselves,
separate from one another,

03:43.038 --> 03:44.305
not be so codependent.

03:44.406 --> 03:46.006
It is, and I am trying.

03:46.107 --> 03:47.641
It's just an adjustment.

03:47.742 --> 03:49.877
And it's difficult
because I worry about him.

03:49.978 --> 03:52.179
Okay. Well, I think
I have just the thing

03:52.280 --> 03:53.714
to get your mind off of him.

03:55.717 --> 03:57.718
An armed robbery
on 98th Street?

03:57.819 --> 04:00.221
Yeah, a real case.
No beasts.

04:00.322 --> 04:02.790
No serum victims
with crazy powers.

04:02.891 --> 04:04.558
Just some good
old-fashioned police work.

04:04.659 --> 04:06.527
This could be good.
I could use this.

04:06.628 --> 04:09.163
Great. Glad you agree.

04:09.264 --> 04:12.499
Catherine Chandler,
meet Detective Wesley Atchison,

04:12.601 --> 04:14.401
your new partner.
Captain Vargas

04:14.502 --> 04:16.803
tells me you're one
of the 125th's best.

04:16.904 --> 04:18.906
I'm stoked to be working
with a seasoned veteran.

04:19.007 --> 04:20.507
(laughs)
Okay.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.309
Could you just give
us a minute, Atkinson?

04:22.410 --> 04:26.247
Oh, Atchison, ma'am,
like, uh, itch, but with an "A."

04:26.348 --> 04:27.615
Oh, yeah. Mm.
Yeah.

04:33.154 --> 04:35.055
Seriously?

04:35.156 --> 04:36.890
Baby-sitting duty?
This is not just

04:36.992 --> 04:38.786
about distracting me
from Vincent, is it?

04:38.787 --> 04:40.694
All right.
Okay, so I buried the lead.

04:40.795 --> 04:43.364
Come on, Cat, ever since
I took over this precinct,

04:43.465 --> 04:45.766
I am under a ton of pressure
to get the numbers up.

04:45.867 --> 04:47.507
And that means,
I need the next generation

04:47.535 --> 04:48.902
of detectives up to snuff.

04:49.004 --> 04:50.271
Okay, but why me?

04:50.372 --> 04:51.672
Because it's my ass
on the line.

04:51.773 --> 04:54.341
I need you here.
I need you present, Cat.

04:54.442 --> 04:56.076
Not hunting beasts or mutants

04:56.177 --> 04:58.746
or whatever freaky things
are threatening the world.

04:58.847 --> 05:00.047
I can't always cover for you.

05:00.148 --> 05:02.082
Okay. Anything else?

05:02.183 --> 05:04.518
Yes, actually.

05:04.619 --> 05:06.553
Do not go pestering JT, either.

05:06.655 --> 05:10.791
I know that he is helping you
track down Bob and Carol,

05:10.892 --> 05:13.360
but he... he has his own issues
to deal with.

05:13.461 --> 05:14.528
Oh, what's going on?

05:14.629 --> 05:15.929
It's that, uh...

05:16.031 --> 05:17.398
the healing factor
in that serum.

05:17.499 --> 05:18.766
It's... it's accelerating.

05:18.867 --> 05:21.869
Is he okay?
Better than okay.

05:21.970 --> 05:23.290
His-his vision's
suddenly perfect.

05:23.338 --> 05:25.706
He doesn't even need
his glasses anymore.

05:25.807 --> 05:27.541
Wow, that is huge.
Yeah.

05:27.642 --> 05:29.410
And scary,
'cause he can't figure out a way

05:29.511 --> 05:31.045
to extract it from his system.

05:31.146 --> 05:33.614
So that's what he needs
to be doing with his time, not

05:33.715 --> 05:37.484
figuring out the mythological
mysteries of Catherine Chandler.

05:37.585 --> 05:38.819
Understand?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.288
Yes.

05:42.857 --> 05:45.326
Itch with an "A",
you're with me.

05:50.098 --> 05:52.399
(phone ringing)

05:52.500 --> 05:56.970
(sighs)

05:57.072 --> 05:58.972
If this is about Bob
and Carol again...

05:59.074 --> 06:00.574
CATHERINE:
How do you know

06:00.675 --> 06:03.310
I'm not just calling
to see how you're feeling?

06:03.411 --> 06:04.678
Because I know you, Cat.

06:04.779 --> 06:06.113
Once you latch on to a mystery,

06:06.214 --> 06:07.448
it's like a dog

06:07.549 --> 06:09.149
with a bone.
You never let go.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.518
I let go.
JT: Oh, yeah? So, you're not

06:11.619 --> 06:13.987
trying to use the threat
of Bob and Carol to convince

06:14.089 --> 06:16.657
Vincent not to leave?
CATHERINE: Is that what he told you?

06:16.758 --> 06:19.693
This is the problem when
everyone knows your business.

06:19.794 --> 06:22.763
Okay, fine.
This is about Bob and Carol.

06:22.864 --> 06:24.264
Have you found anything yet?

06:24.366 --> 06:26.800
Maybe. Been following
some surveillance leads

06:26.901 --> 06:29.870
that might help narrow down
who they are, where they live.

06:29.971 --> 06:31.805
It looks like they keep crossing
the Brooklyn Bridge.

06:31.906 --> 06:33.207
Well, that's good.
Anything else?

06:33.308 --> 06:35.008
Yeah, I've also been working

06:35.110 --> 06:38.312
on the serum, trying to figure
out how to get it out of me.

06:38.413 --> 06:42.015
But more importantly for you,
I think I came up with a theory

06:42.117 --> 06:45.119
about how Bob and Carol's
enhanced power works.

06:45.220 --> 06:46.787
I think they can slow down

06:46.888 --> 06:48.389
their heart rates and speed up

06:48.490 --> 06:49.823
their brains' processing power

06:49.924 --> 06:51.558
to such an extent

06:51.659 --> 06:54.061
that they see the world
in slow motion.

06:54.162 --> 06:57.064
Meaning they can anticipate
and adjust to anything.

06:57.165 --> 06:58.499
That explains why they seemed

06:58.600 --> 07:00.033
to be one step ahead
of us in our fight,

07:00.135 --> 07:01.902
and why they can make
impossible shots.

07:02.003 --> 07:03.337
Yeah, but remember,

07:03.438 --> 07:05.078
they have to see
for their powers to work,

07:05.140 --> 07:06.373
which means

07:06.474 --> 07:07.674
if you could somehow

07:07.776 --> 07:09.510
impair their vision,
blind them...

07:09.611 --> 07:11.245
It might make it a fair fight next time.
JT: Exactly.

07:11.346 --> 07:13.680
(phone ringing and buzzing)

07:16.684 --> 07:18.585
Uh, I gotta go now.

07:27.595 --> 07:30.864
So, about that armed robbery...

07:30.965 --> 07:32.666
VINCENT:
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

07:32.767 --> 07:34.701
Look, I need you
to do me a favor, okay?

07:34.803 --> 07:36.170
JT:
First Cat,

07:36.271 --> 07:37.271
now you. I swear,

07:37.272 --> 07:38.338
you two are

07:38.440 --> 07:39.940
incapable of letting things go.

07:40.041 --> 07:42.943
Look, maybe I'm not so worried
about her, okay?

07:43.044 --> 07:45.379
Maybe...
maybe I'm worried about me.

07:45.480 --> 07:48.081
Is this about you going primal?

07:48.183 --> 07:50.551
Dude, seriously,
think about the odds.

07:50.652 --> 07:52.219
Also, think about
how far you've come,

07:52.320 --> 07:54.555
how much control you have
over your inner beast now.

07:54.656 --> 07:56.757
Yes, okay, but only

07:56.858 --> 07:59.059
when Catherine is there
to pull me back, right?

07:59.160 --> 08:00.561
Even when she's not,

08:00.662 --> 08:03.864
her love is still
with you, Vincent. Always.

08:03.965 --> 08:05.599
You got to start
trusting that.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.434
MAN:
<i>Now, why should I trust</i>

08:07.535 --> 08:10.037
you people
when you're never around?

08:10.138 --> 08:12.372
I've been robbed three times

08:12.474 --> 08:13.907
in the past month.

08:14.008 --> 08:15.709
Never a cop to be seen.

08:15.810 --> 08:17.911
Sir, if you can, please just try
and describe the assailant?

08:18.012 --> 08:20.247
He's a victim. Ask him

08:20.348 --> 08:21.882
if there's anything
he needs first.

08:21.983 --> 08:23.450
Oh. Sorry.
Yeah.

08:23.551 --> 08:26.086
Uh, is there anything
we can do for you first?

08:26.187 --> 08:27.654
What? First?

08:27.755 --> 08:28.889
(laughs)
Yeah.

08:28.990 --> 08:30.123
The first thing you can do

08:30.225 --> 08:31.959
is catch the son of a bitch
that did this to me.

08:32.059 --> 08:34.160
That's what you can do!

08:34.261 --> 08:36.395
Carol.

08:36.498 --> 08:38.465
Uh, Detective... uh,
just don't go anywhere, sir.

08:38.566 --> 08:41.534
(tires squealing,
horn honks)

08:51.913 --> 08:54.581
Detective... you do realize
you just totally abandoned me

08:54.682 --> 08:56.517
back there.

08:56.618 --> 08:58.018
Is something wrong?
No, nothing's wrong.

08:58.119 --> 08:59.520
Everything is okay.

08:59.621 --> 09:02.422
CAROL:
<i>Bad news, honey.</i>

09:02.524 --> 09:04.925
Cat's still not taking the bait.
BOB: Carol, babe, the plan is in motion.

09:04.926 --> 09:07.049
We've got them separated,
Vincent is already on his way.

09:07.050 --> 09:07.625
CAROL: I know, and I keep

09:07.629 --> 09:09.630
trying to lure her, but she
keeps stopping for some reason.

09:09.731 --> 09:11.665
I don't get it.
BOB: Well, you'd better figure it out

09:11.766 --> 09:13.467
before Vincent gets here,
because we've both seen

09:13.568 --> 09:15.202
firsthand how well they work
when they're together.

09:15.303 --> 09:17.538
You got to kill her.
I know, but she's a cop.

09:17.639 --> 09:19.373
I can't just shoot her
in broad daylight.

09:19.474 --> 09:21.208
We'll have half the force
breathing down our neck.

09:21.309 --> 09:23.544
It's tricky.
BOB: Carol, listen to me.

09:23.645 --> 09:25.279
Our only hope

09:25.380 --> 09:26.980
to make up
for not killing them last time

09:26.981 --> 09:28.315
is to bring back the beast,

09:28.416 --> 09:30.284
and a very, very special beast.

09:30.385 --> 09:31.351
And the only way
to find out if that's

09:31.452 --> 09:33.153
Vincent is to make sure

09:33.254 --> 09:35.389
that Cat isn't alive
to save him.

09:35.490 --> 09:37.457
I won't let you down.

09:37.559 --> 09:39.826
You never do.

09:41.796 --> 09:43.564
Come on, buddy.

09:43.665 --> 09:44.998
Let's go get Vincent.

09:45.099 --> 09:47.935

(phone rings)

10:00.525 --> 10:04.795
(static) Hey. Cat? Cat?
What's wrong? You okay?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.370
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Why wouldn't it be?

10:06.394 --> 10:07.231
It's 11:48.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.600
We said we'd talk at noon.
You're breaking the rules.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.901
By, like, 12 minutes. I didn't
realize that was a crime.

10:11.937 --> 10:14.372
All right, just come on,
if we don't follow the rules,

10:14.473 --> 10:15.706
we'll never break our codep...

10:15.807 --> 10:16.807
No.

10:16.808 --> 10:18.009
Do not use the "C" word.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.510
This is not about codependency.

10:19.611 --> 10:20.711
(sighs):
Okay.

10:20.812 --> 10:22.113
What's up?

10:22.214 --> 10:24.048
Someone got saddled

10:24.149 --> 10:25.883
with a new partner.

10:27.419 --> 10:30.321
(sighs) I mean,
I get that Carol is trying

10:30.422 --> 10:31.789
to prove herself
as captain, but...

10:31.890 --> 10:34.492
Uh, you mean Tess, right?

10:34.593 --> 10:35.693
That's what I said.

10:35.794 --> 10:37.294
Uh, no, no, you didn't.

10:37.396 --> 10:38.396
I'm pretty sure I did.

10:38.497 --> 10:39.730
Catherine,

10:39.831 --> 10:41.732
I distinctly
heard you say "Carol."

10:41.833 --> 10:45.069
Okay, why would say "Carol"
if I was talking about Tess?

10:45.170 --> 10:47.138
I don't know, maybe
you got Carol on the brain.

10:47.239 --> 10:49.073
Have you been
chasing ghosts again?

10:49.174 --> 10:50.408
That's why you're
breaking the rules?

10:50.509 --> 10:52.176
Okay, fine.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.979
Maybe I did think
I saw Carol again,

10:55.080 --> 10:56.981
but you,
you will be happy to know

10:57.082 --> 10:58.849
that I did not
go down the rabbit hole.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.851
Well, that's good, right?
That's progress.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.086
I guess so.

11:02.187 --> 11:04.255
You don't sound so convinced.

11:04.356 --> 11:05.823
I just can't shake the feeling

11:05.924 --> 11:07.058
that something bad
is gonna happen.

11:07.159 --> 11:08.492
Well...

11:08.593 --> 11:10.861
that's basically our reality,
you know?

11:10.962 --> 11:13.431
What, I'm just supposed
to accept that?

11:13.532 --> 11:15.032
No, you just got
to have faith that

11:15.133 --> 11:16.333
we'll get through it, right?
We both do.

11:16.435 --> 11:17.935
Remember what
the counselor said?

11:18.036 --> 11:20.004
(staticky): We have to have
tru... other... apart.

11:20.105 --> 11:21.772
Vincent, you're breaking up.

11:21.873 --> 11:23.674
I said,
we got to trust each other...

11:23.775 --> 11:25.843
(staticky): while we're apart.
Hello?

11:25.944 --> 11:27.111
(staticky):
Hello? Can you hear...

11:27.212 --> 11:28.979
Are you there?
Hello? (groans)

11:30.048 --> 11:31.282
Can...

11:32.884 --> 11:34.719
Everything okay?
Yeah.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.353
Couldn't be better.

11:36.455 --> 11:37.755
Back to work.

11:37.856 --> 11:39.623
BOB: How can you be sure
this is gonna work?

11:39.725 --> 11:42.026
She's a cop, isn't she?
She follows clues.

11:42.127 --> 11:44.261
Well, this one
she won't be able to ignore.

11:44.362 --> 11:47.565
You got to make it look like
she died in the line of duty,

11:47.666 --> 11:48.986
like, gang crossfire or
something.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.868
If you tell me that
one more time, Bob,

11:50.969 --> 11:52.470
we are going back
into counseling.

11:52.571 --> 11:54.238
I'm sorry, I'm just...

11:54.339 --> 11:55.939
a bit nervous is all.
You worry too much.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.541
Always have.

11:57.642 --> 11:58.809
Well, still,
if this doesn't work,

11:58.910 --> 12:00.277
there's no place
for us to hide, Carol.

12:00.378 --> 12:01.746
Which means the boss
will never give us

12:01.847 --> 12:03.814
the antidote to get this damn
serum out of our blood.

12:03.915 --> 12:05.049
We'll end up just like

12:05.150 --> 12:07.418
all the other experiments.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.620
Then we'll go down together
like Bonnie and Clyde.

12:09.721 --> 12:12.456
Always a romantic, aren't you?

12:12.557 --> 12:14.625
But we're not going down
without a fight.

12:14.726 --> 12:16.494
Make sure Vincent checks out.
Put him through all the tests.

12:16.595 --> 12:17.661
If he passes,

12:17.763 --> 12:19.497
we're all good.

12:19.598 --> 12:21.432
Don't worry about Cat.
I'll take care of her.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.668
I love you.

12:24.770 --> 12:26.170
I love you, too.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.444
(line ringing)

12:33.545 --> 12:35.146
OPERATOR:
911, what is your emergency?

12:35.247 --> 12:36.514
I'd like to report a murder.

12:36.615 --> 12:38.015
I'm sorry, did you say a murder?

12:39.284 --> 12:42.253
Ma'am, hello?

12:42.354 --> 12:43.354
What is your location?

12:43.421 --> 12:44.922
Ma'am?

12:45.023 --> 12:46.323
Hello?

12:46.424 --> 12:48.159
Are you able to speak?

12:48.260 --> 12:49.527
(sirens wailing)

12:51.797 --> 12:52.863
Here's what we know.

12:52.964 --> 12:54.098
Victim is male, mid-40s.

12:54.199 --> 12:55.699
Owner of this restaurant.

12:55.801 --> 12:57.368
Killed by a single gunshot.

12:57.469 --> 12:59.703
Not witnesses,
no signs of forced entry.

13:00.972 --> 13:02.006
Right across from Il Cantuccio.

13:02.107 --> 13:03.207
We were just there.

13:03.308 --> 13:05.009
That's so weird.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.143
Victim was upright and standing

13:06.244 --> 13:08.445
when he got shot.
At, uh,

13:08.547 --> 13:10.114
point-blank range?
No, from a distance.

13:10.215 --> 13:11.615
High-powered rifle,
from the looks

13:11.716 --> 13:12.983
of the blood spatter.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.284
Well, there's no bullet holes,

13:14.286 --> 13:15.486
no broken glass,

13:15.587 --> 13:17.021
so where'd the shot come from?

13:17.122 --> 13:18.355
There.

13:21.326 --> 13:22.726
No way.

13:22.828 --> 13:24.508
A Navy SEAL sniper
couldn't make that kill.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.697
That's an impossible shot.

13:26.798 --> 13:28.632
What'd you just say?

13:28.733 --> 13:30.367
Well, I said that's
an impossible shot.

13:32.070 --> 13:33.170
Carol.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.005
Carol could've made that shot.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.707
Uh, who's Carol?
One half

13:36.808 --> 13:38.209
of a husband-wife assassin team

13:38.310 --> 13:39.577
wanted for the murder
of a DHS agent.

13:39.678 --> 13:41.245
Whoa, why would
an assassin want to kill

13:41.346 --> 13:42.746
a random restaurant owner?

13:42.848 --> 13:44.081
I don't see the connection.

13:44.182 --> 13:46.450
I'm the connection.

13:47.853 --> 13:49.486
She could still
be out there. I want...

13:49.588 --> 13:51.222
I want uniforms
on all the adjacent rooftops.

13:51.323 --> 13:53.724
Go. Go, go!

13:55.493 --> 13:57.695
You've reached
Dr. Vincent Keller.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.163
Please leave a message.
Damn it.

13:59.264 --> 14:00.898
Vincent, you have to trust me.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.499
I am not just seeing ghosts.

14:02.601 --> 14:04.068
Carol is back,
which means that Bob is, too.

14:04.169 --> 14:05.436
Call me.

14:05.537 --> 14:07.538
(sighs)

14:10.108 --> 14:11.942
Mr. Daniels!

14:12.043 --> 14:13.110
It's Dr. Keller

14:13.211 --> 14:15.145
from New York General.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.590
(gun clicks)

14:35.734 --> 14:37.735
BOB:
Not bad, Vincent!

14:37.836 --> 14:40.638
Now let's see what else
you can do, huh?

14:42.073 --> 14:43.841
Bob.

14:51.632 --> 14:53.632
EDDIE:
Somebody help me!

14:56.836 --> 14:58.604
Now, what's it gonna be,
beastie boy?

14:58.705 --> 15:01.707
Save the innocent
or save yourself, huh?

15:01.808 --> 15:03.876
EDDIE:
Someone please help!

15:03.977 --> 15:06.145
Anybody!

15:12.685 --> 15:14.420
CATHERINE:
<i>I need to find Vincent.</i>

15:14.521 --> 15:15.788
Why?

15:15.889 --> 15:17.089
The homicide
at the restaurant,

15:17.157 --> 15:18.891
that Vic was shot,
from a distance,

15:18.992 --> 15:20.559
through an opening
of less than an inch.

15:20.660 --> 15:22.461
That's impossible.
Exactly.

15:22.562 --> 15:23.929
And which two people do we know

15:24.030 --> 15:25.597
that are capable
of the impossible?

15:25.698 --> 15:27.199
Cat.
Listen to me, all right?

15:27.300 --> 15:29.368
Ever since Carol
and Bob disappeared,

15:29.469 --> 15:31.470
I've had this sinking feeling
that she's been stalking me,

15:31.571 --> 15:32.871
trying to draw me out.

15:32.972 --> 15:34.306
To do what?
The same thing

15:34.407 --> 15:36.041
that she and her husband
tried to do last time:

15:36.142 --> 15:37.409
kill me, kill us.

15:37.510 --> 15:39.111
Tess, please,

15:39.212 --> 15:41.213
trust me,
take me off babysitting duty,

15:41.314 --> 15:42.815
and let me go after her.

15:42.916 --> 15:44.082
Cat, I'm not saying
that you're wrong,

15:44.184 --> 15:45.584
but now that I'm captain,
I have to play

15:45.685 --> 15:46.819
by the book here, okay?

15:46.920 --> 15:48.220
That means I need evidence.

15:48.321 --> 15:49.888
I need proof.
You get me that,

15:49.989 --> 15:51.723
I will personally help you
take her down, okay?

15:51.825 --> 15:55.494
Tess, okay, but...
It's an order, Detective.

15:55.595 --> 15:57.796
Aye, aye, Captain.

16:01.901 --> 16:03.602
(sighs)
(phone ringing)

16:03.703 --> 16:05.537
(door closes)

16:07.207 --> 16:09.107
Can I call you back, JT?
It's not a good time.

16:09.209 --> 16:10.209
I mean, not really.

16:10.276 --> 16:11.310
It's about Bob and Carol.

16:11.411 --> 16:12.411
Of course it is.

16:12.512 --> 16:13.579
Wait, what happened?
What's wrong?

16:13.680 --> 16:14.746
No, no, it's...

16:14.848 --> 16:16.748
I got into it with Cat,

16:16.850 --> 16:18.517
and I-I had to pull rank.

16:18.618 --> 16:20.285
How'd she react?

16:20.386 --> 16:22.087
About as well
as you'd expect her to.

16:22.188 --> 16:24.068
It's definitely not
my favorite part of the job.

16:24.090 --> 16:25.757
That's for sure.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.759
That's why I thought I better
call you instead of Cat.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.961
Let you decide what to do.

16:29.062 --> 16:30.329
Okay, I'm listening.

16:30.430 --> 16:32.331
I think I found where Bob
and Carol live,

16:32.432 --> 16:35.534
and not a safe house,
but in a family neighborhood.

16:35.635 --> 16:36.768
A Brooklyn brownstone.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.537
Think we should loop in Cat?

16:38.638 --> 16:39.805
No.

16:39.906 --> 16:40.906
Not yet, because then

16:40.974 --> 16:42.140
she is not doing her job,

16:42.242 --> 16:43.475
and I'm not doing mine.

16:43.576 --> 16:45.611
All right, I will come
and pick you up,

16:45.712 --> 16:46.845
and we will search this out

16:46.946 --> 16:48.280
off the record.

16:48.381 --> 16:49.882
Okay.

16:51.551 --> 16:53.218
I've got a theory,
but I need evidence.

16:53.319 --> 16:55.354
Uh, fingerprints, ballistics,
anything. What have we got?

16:55.455 --> 16:57.890
Well, forensics found a bag
of meth on the deceased.

16:57.991 --> 16:59.992
Maybe some kind
of deal gone bad.

17:00.093 --> 17:03.028
Maybe, and if it was,
it'll lead us to the sellers,

17:03.129 --> 17:04.630
but if it wasn't,
it'll lead us

17:04.731 --> 17:08.066
into whatever trap
Carol's trying to pull me into.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.334
Again with this mysterious
Carol person?

17:09.435 --> 17:10.836
You care to clue me in?

17:10.936 --> 17:13.070
Okay, addresses,
suspected meth labs.

17:13.172 --> 17:14.306
Go.

17:14.406 --> 17:15.973
(sighs)

17:16.075 --> 17:17.843
Okay.

17:17.944 --> 17:20.112
EDDIE:
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

17:23.516 --> 17:25.050
Help me.

17:25.151 --> 17:26.351
Hey, easy.

17:26.452 --> 17:27.819
Hey, Eddie, okay,
I'm not gonna hurt you,

17:27.921 --> 17:30.355
okay?
How do you know my name?

17:30.456 --> 17:33.525
You're not with that other guy, are you?
No.

17:33.626 --> 17:35.861
No, unfortunately,
I'm the one he's after.

17:35.962 --> 17:38.263
Okay, look,
I'm gonna untie you, all right?

17:38.364 --> 17:40.399
He's just using you
to get to me.

17:45.705 --> 17:48.273
I don't... I don't understand.

17:48.374 --> 17:49.575
What do you mean?

17:49.676 --> 17:51.109
Look,

17:51.210 --> 17:53.211
we got to move fast, okay?
We're both in danger.

17:53.313 --> 17:54.680
Can you walk?

17:54.781 --> 17:56.048
He beat me pretty bad.

17:56.149 --> 17:57.449
He moved so fast.

17:57.550 --> 17:59.351
I didn't even see him coming.

17:59.452 --> 18:00.519
I'm gonna help you up, all right?
Okay.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.054
One, two, three.

18:02.155 --> 18:03.255
Got to move fast.

18:03.356 --> 18:04.456
All right?

18:04.557 --> 18:06.191
(gunshot)
Move fast.

18:06.292 --> 18:08.126
No!

18:10.663 --> 18:11.930
(gunshot)

18:13.366 --> 18:14.800
You didn't have to kill him!

18:14.901 --> 18:16.902
And you didn't have
to try to save him.

18:17.003 --> 18:18.470
But you did.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.107
Unfortunately for you,

18:22.208 --> 18:25.410
you're passing all the tests.

18:27.380 --> 18:29.881
Why you doing this, huh?

18:29.983 --> 18:30.983
Come on, spit it out.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.119
What do you want from me?

18:37.423 --> 18:39.591
Knock, knock.

18:42.095 --> 18:44.096
Just because you're dating
a police captain

18:44.197 --> 18:46.264
doesn't mean you can kick
in other people's doors.

18:46.366 --> 18:47.566
Vincent does it all the time.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.001
Why can't I have
some fun, too?

18:50.870 --> 18:52.170
Because Vincent's a beast,

18:52.271 --> 18:53.772
Bob and Carol
are super assassins,

18:53.873 --> 18:56.008
and you're just a dude
who heals himself.

18:56.109 --> 18:57.309
Gee, thanks.

18:57.410 --> 18:59.344
Sorry, I'm a little cranky.

19:03.216 --> 19:05.951
Did you figure out how to get
that serum out of your body?

19:06.052 --> 19:08.253
No. Although,
when it worked on the heart

19:08.354 --> 19:10.255
a couple weeks ago,
I think it's because, uh,

19:10.356 --> 19:13.458
the transplant pushed
the serum past it's limits,

19:13.559 --> 19:15.794
like, shocked the system.

19:15.895 --> 19:18.263
Overloaded it.

19:18.364 --> 19:19.865
All right, well, uh,

19:19.966 --> 19:21.566
just don't go shocking
your system, okay?

19:21.634 --> 19:23.201
I know you're desperate,
but don't be stupid.

19:23.302 --> 19:25.303
Geez, you are cranky.

19:27.974 --> 19:29.307
This is not what I expected.

19:29.409 --> 19:30.809
It's very homey.

19:30.910 --> 19:32.844
Uh-oh.

19:34.447 --> 19:35.747
Uh-oh, what?

19:36.983 --> 19:38.283
You don't...

19:38.384 --> 19:39.651
see it, those markings?

19:41.821 --> 19:43.021
What markings?

19:49.996 --> 19:51.163
Those.

19:53.132 --> 19:55.067
You can see
in the dark now, too?

19:56.169 --> 19:58.470
Looks like it.

19:58.571 --> 20:00.872
All right.

20:00.973 --> 20:03.909
That is the restaurant across
the street from Il Cantuccio.

20:04.010 --> 20:06.678
That's the precinct.
New York General.

20:06.779 --> 20:09.748
This all falls
within 125th's jurisdiction.

20:09.849 --> 20:11.650
And Lake Placid
where Vincent is.

20:11.751 --> 20:13.485
(sighs)
Cat was right.

20:13.586 --> 20:15.654
Bob and Carol are after her and Vincent.
Yeah,

20:15.755 --> 20:17.089
and by separating them
because they know

20:17.190 --> 20:19.424
they're stronger together.
Call Vincent.

20:19.525 --> 20:20.064
I will call Cat.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.827
 (recorded): You've reached
Dr. Vincent Keller...

20:21.828 --> 20:23.495
(recorded): You've reached
Detective Chandler...

20:23.596 --> 20:25.497
Damn it. (sighs)
Voicemail.

20:25.598 --> 20:27.265
You got to get to Cat.

20:27.366 --> 20:28.934
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna find Vincent.

20:29.035 --> 20:30.202
Someone's got to warn him.

20:30.303 --> 20:31.369
No.

20:32.772 --> 20:34.005
Don't do anything
stupid, all right?

20:34.107 --> 20:35.240
Don't worry about me.

20:35.341 --> 20:36.742
I can heal, remember?

20:36.843 --> 20:37.843
(kisses)

20:39.378 --> 20:40.378
(door opens, shuts)

20:40.379 --> 20:42.814
(sighs)

20:58.731 --> 20:59.778
You sure this is it?

20:59.802 --> 21:01.566
Traced the type of meth
we found on the Vic.

21:01.567 --> 21:03.635
Matches a lab
that used to be here.

21:03.736 --> 21:05.203
Ten bucks says it isn't anymore.

21:05.304 --> 21:06.705
Then why are we here?

21:06.806 --> 21:08.807
(beeping)

21:08.908 --> 21:10.876
I've got no signal.
Give me your phone.

21:10.977 --> 21:12.911
Yeah.

21:14.747 --> 21:16.715
(phone beeping)
Damn it.

21:16.816 --> 21:17.983
She's jammed our reception.

21:18.084 --> 21:19.885
Oh, let me guess.

21:19.986 --> 21:21.253
Carol again?

21:21.354 --> 21:23.321
Yeah, she, uh, she planted

21:23.422 --> 21:24.556
the meth so that I would find it

21:24.657 --> 21:26.825
and lead me into a trap.
You got to get

21:26.926 --> 21:28.760
the hell out of here, you
got to get your ass back

21:28.861 --> 21:30.796
to the precinct, get Captain
Vargas, bring in the cavalry.

21:30.897 --> 21:32.798
Wait a minute-- is this
some kind of new partner test

21:32.899 --> 21:34.332
to see if I'll abandon you
in the middle of nowh...?.

21:34.433 --> 21:36.193
No This is not a test.
We have been compromised.

21:36.269 --> 21:37.469
You need to get the
hell out of here

21:37.570 --> 21:39.004
before it's too late!
No!

21:39.105 --> 21:40.138
If someone is seriously
trying to kill you

21:40.239 --> 21:41.319
I'm not just gonna sit here

21:41.374 --> 21:42.174
and leave you by yourself...

21:42.275 --> 21:43.341
Aah!

21:43.442 --> 21:45.577
Oh, God! Come on!

21:45.678 --> 21:47.779
Get in the car!

21:47.880 --> 21:49.648
Damn it.
Get in.

21:49.749 --> 21:51.029
Put pressure on it.
Don't let go.

21:51.050 --> 21:52.250
You think you can drive?
Yeah!

21:52.351 --> 21:53.685
Get out of here.
Don't look back.

21:53.786 --> 21:55.253
Drive! Drive!

21:55.354 --> 21:57.455
(car engine starts)

22:02.795 --> 22:05.130
(engine revs,
tires screech in distance)

22:06.399 --> 22:07.833
All right, Carol.

22:07.934 --> 22:09.835
You want me?

22:09.936 --> 22:11.870
You got me.

22:33.129 --> 22:35.363
(gunshots nearby)
Vincent!

22:41.671 --> 22:43.138
BOB:
Run, beast, run.

22:46.375 --> 22:48.376
(both grunt)

22:52.848 --> 22:54.449
For the record, it was
Bob's idea to blow

22:54.550 --> 22:56.117
you guys up last time,
not mine.

22:56.219 --> 22:57.319
(both grunting)

23:03.526 --> 23:05.694
I thought you guys
operate as a team.

23:05.795 --> 23:07.862
Where's your other half?

23:07.964 --> 23:09.464
Well, we don't need to be joined
at the hip like you and Vincent.

23:09.565 --> 23:11.466
How is couples counseling
going, anyway?

23:11.567 --> 23:12.801
So this was
your plan, huh?

23:12.902 --> 23:14.202
Instead of killing me
from a distance

23:14.303 --> 23:15.470
like Agent Thomas,

23:15.571 --> 23:17.906
you lured me out here,
somewhere isolated,

23:18.007 --> 23:20.327
where everyone would think that
I died in the line of duty.

23:20.376 --> 23:22.110
Don't want to leave
any tracks, right?

23:22.211 --> 23:25.547
Besides, killing from a
distance is so impersonal.

23:25.648 --> 23:28.683
Here, in these close quarters,
I can see your every move.

23:33.589 --> 23:35.624
Unless you can't.

23:38.928 --> 23:41.363
(both grunting)

24:11.394 --> 24:13.328
Aah!

24:34.083 --> 24:36.718
BOB:
Sorry, Vincent!

24:36.819 --> 24:39.988
But I'm not gonna be
that easy to find.

24:40.089 --> 24:43.058
(gunshot)

24:43.159 --> 24:45.393
Got to admit, though,
you're quite the tracker.

24:45.494 --> 24:47.329
But I want to see more.

24:47.430 --> 24:49.064
I want to see
what you can really do.

24:49.165 --> 24:51.132
Why?

24:51.233 --> 24:53.702
I'm more valuable to you
alive than dead?

24:53.803 --> 24:55.737
Yeah, but only
if you can stay alive.

24:55.838 --> 24:59.207
Only if you're the beast
that I hope you are.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.949
Why didn't you try and capture
me a couple of weeks ago, huh?

25:09.752 --> 25:11.686
Why'd you and Carol try
and kill us instead?

25:11.787 --> 25:12.787
BOB:
Because.

25:12.855 --> 25:14.656
We didn't know who you were.

25:14.757 --> 25:16.858
Or, rather, what you were.

25:16.959 --> 25:18.860
But that's what we're
here to find out.

25:18.961 --> 25:21.201
Suppose you don't care to tell
me who you're working for?

25:21.263 --> 25:23.998
Hmm? Who it is that thinks
I'm so valuable?

25:24.100 --> 25:26.234
Why don't you
show yourself, huh?

25:26.335 --> 25:28.236
And I'll tell you in person.

25:28.337 --> 25:31.206
Why would I do that?
'Cause!

25:31.307 --> 25:33.942
It'll give you a chance
to save your beloved Catherine.

25:34.043 --> 25:35.944
Unless, of course, Carol's

25:36.045 --> 25:37.245
killed her already.

25:37.346 --> 25:39.347
I swear...

25:39.448 --> 25:41.349
if anything happens
to Catherine, I'll...

25:41.450 --> 25:42.917
You'll what, huh?

25:43.018 --> 25:44.119
Go primal?

25:45.454 --> 25:47.589
Lose your humanity?

25:47.690 --> 25:49.457
What do you think
I'm waiting to see, huh?

25:56.532 --> 25:58.967
You want to see?!

26:05.241 --> 26:07.575
(growling)

26:13.015 --> 26:15.083
(grunting)

26:16.419 --> 26:19.187
(roaring)

26:27.096 --> 26:29.664
(huffing, growling)

26:44.914 --> 26:46.648
(growling)

26:55.524 --> 26:59.527
You passed every
test, Vincent.

26:59.628 --> 27:00.862
Congratulations.

27:00.963 --> 27:03.431
(roars)

27:03.532 --> 27:07.202
My boss will be surprised
to know you actually exist.

27:07.303 --> 27:08.837
(growls, huffs)

27:12.441 --> 27:13.808
I'm sorry about Catherine.

27:13.909 --> 27:15.710
I know how I'd feel

27:15.811 --> 27:18.112
if I lost Carol.

27:18.214 --> 27:19.781
No...

27:19.882 --> 27:21.816
(groans in pain, grunts)

27:32.628 --> 27:34.562
(sirens wailing)

27:42.338 --> 27:43.505
Make a perimeter!

27:43.606 --> 27:45.206
No one goes in until I say so!

27:45.307 --> 27:47.041
OFFICER: Got it, chief!
Going around back.

28:00.990 --> 28:03.424
Thanks for the backup,
but I got it.

28:03.526 --> 28:05.593
Get her in the car.

28:05.694 --> 28:06.207
Atchison?

28:06.231 --> 28:08.463
He made it to the station.
They patched him up. He's fine.

28:08.464 --> 28:11.099
Thanks to you getting him out
of here, he's gonna be okay.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.167
I know, I should've listened to
you, I should've believed you.

28:13.269 --> 28:14.903
No, it's okay. Forget it.

28:15.004 --> 28:16.704
I was starting to think
I was chasing ghosts, too.

28:16.805 --> 28:19.440
Yeah, but Cat, they weren't
just after you.

28:19.542 --> 28:22.210
They split you up on purpose.
Bob's after Vincent, too.

28:22.311 --> 28:23.611
What? Where?

28:23.712 --> 28:25.179
Lake Placid.
JT's heading there now.

28:25.281 --> 28:28.049
But the chances of him
finding Vincent...

28:29.318 --> 28:31.352
Where's Vincent?

28:31.453 --> 28:34.923
Somewhere not even your love
can save him anymore.

28:43.053 --> 28:44.420
Vincent!

28:58.134 --> 28:59.668
(line ringing)

28:59.769 --> 29:01.003
TESS:
Leave a message.

29:01.104 --> 29:02.671
Tess, if you get this message,

29:02.772 --> 29:04.373
Bob's got Vincent
and he's getting away.

29:04.474 --> 29:06.008
Don't hate me.

29:06.109 --> 29:07.676
But I've got a stupid plan

29:07.777 --> 29:11.146
of how to save
both Vincent and maybe me.

29:11.247 --> 29:13.649
If it doesn't work... uh,

29:13.750 --> 29:16.085
I've been meaning
to say something.

29:16.186 --> 29:17.619
So here goes:

29:19.155 --> 29:21.090
I love you.

29:26.596 --> 29:28.630
CAROL: <i>I know how much</i>
<i>you love Vincent.</i>

29:30.667 --> 29:32.000
Guess I should
say "loved" him.

29:32.102 --> 29:33.102
I'm not worried about Vincent.

29:33.203 --> 29:34.503
He can take care of himself.

29:34.604 --> 29:36.105
No, he can't.

29:36.206 --> 29:38.607
Not without you there
to save him, Cat, you know that.

29:38.708 --> 29:39.942
And Bob and I know it, too.

29:40.043 --> 29:41.076
We saw it first hand,

29:41.177 --> 29:42.344
when we were all
working together.

29:42.445 --> 29:43.965
Yeah, we were
never "working together."

29:43.980 --> 29:45.080
You were trying
to figure out what we knew

29:45.181 --> 29:46.782
before you tried to kill us.

29:46.883 --> 29:49.118
Still, we got to know you.

29:49.219 --> 29:52.121
You reminded us so much of us
when we first got engaged.

29:52.222 --> 29:53.856
Inseparable, to a fault.

29:53.957 --> 29:56.024
That's why we came
up with this plan.

29:56.126 --> 29:57.893
To separate us,

29:57.994 --> 30:00.896
so that you could kill me
and capture Vincent?

30:00.997 --> 30:03.265
How do you know
that we haven't changed, grown?

30:03.366 --> 30:06.268
Codependency is not something
that changes overnight.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.771
It takes more than a few weeks,
trust me.

30:08.872 --> 30:10.773
No, you trust me.

30:10.874 --> 30:13.542
In the end,
it is gonna be Vincent

30:13.643 --> 30:15.744
who walks through that door,
not Bob.

30:15.845 --> 30:18.714
And then we'll see
how much you "loved" him.

30:18.815 --> 30:22.618
Or you can tell me
where Vincent is,

30:22.719 --> 30:24.987
help me to bring him back,
and maybe I can help you.

30:25.088 --> 30:26.488
You can't help us now.

30:26.589 --> 30:27.923
Not against this.

30:28.024 --> 30:29.324
The experiments?

30:29.426 --> 30:33.228
Is that what
you're so afraid of?

30:33.329 --> 30:35.397
Or is it whoever's behind it?

30:35.498 --> 30:37.800
Carol, come on,
just give me a name.

30:37.901 --> 30:40.102
Help us to catch
whoever's behind it,

30:40.203 --> 30:42.237
and I-I promise you

30:42.338 --> 30:44.473
I will do
whatever I can to help.

30:44.574 --> 30:47.109
Only Bob can help me now.

30:47.210 --> 30:49.311
And only if Vincent
turns out to be the beast

30:49.412 --> 30:50.846
that we think he is.

30:50.947 --> 30:52.681
And, if he doesn't,
then we're all dead.

30:52.782 --> 30:54.149
TESS: Where is he?!
Where is he?!

30:54.250 --> 30:56.652
Tess! Tess!
I want to know where he is now!

30:56.753 --> 30:57.668
Tess, what's wrong?!

30:57.669 --> 30:59.385
What's wrong is that
I just got a message from JT

30:59.389 --> 31:01.690
who all but said good-bye to me
trying to save Vincent from Bob.

31:01.791 --> 31:03.692
So I want to know where he is!
It's too late.

31:03.793 --> 31:04.927
Hey, Captain,

31:05.028 --> 31:06.929
you need to get a grip.

31:07.030 --> 31:09.031
You can't do this right now,
do you understand me?

31:10.366 --> 31:12.835
Okay, just let me do my job.

31:12.936 --> 31:14.803
Let me keep working
on her, all right?

31:14.904 --> 31:16.805
Okay.

31:16.906 --> 31:20.876
And in the meantime, you and I
both have to have faith.

31:20.977 --> 31:22.945
In Vincent and in JT.

31:23.046 --> 31:24.046
Okay.

31:24.047 --> 31:25.714
Okay?

31:25.815 --> 31:29.218
If JT's dead, you're dead.

31:37.927 --> 31:39.828
BOB:
Good news, babe.

31:39.929 --> 31:41.230
I got him.

31:41.331 --> 31:42.731
The antidote is as good as ours.

31:47.971 --> 31:49.605
What the...?

32:01.384 --> 32:03.685
What the hell
are you doing out here?

32:03.786 --> 32:05.320
Saving my friend.

32:06.623 --> 32:08.457
JT?!
JT: Yeah!

32:08.558 --> 32:09.892
You okay back there?!

32:09.993 --> 32:11.894
JT, get out of here, man!

32:11.995 --> 32:12.995
Go!

32:13.029 --> 32:14.029
Run!

32:14.063 --> 32:15.063
Sorry.

32:15.064 --> 32:16.064
Can't!

32:17.467 --> 32:19.801
Move, or you're a dead man.

32:19.903 --> 32:21.703
JT, listen to him!
Don't be stupid!

32:21.804 --> 32:23.305
I'm tired of people
telling me that.

32:24.908 --> 32:26.642
Remember, you can save yourself!

32:26.743 --> 32:29.678
Remember Cat's love,
it's always there!

32:30.914 --> 32:32.714
VINCENT:
JT!

32:32.815 --> 32:34.883
(engine revs, roars)

32:34.984 --> 32:36.151
No!

32:37.654 --> 32:39.588
No...!

32:48.031 --> 32:50.799
(roars)

32:57.373 --> 33:01.543
(deep growling)

33:13.623 --> 33:14.990
(groans)
Vincent?

33:15.091 --> 33:17.359
(growls, snarls)

33:31.941 --> 33:34.009
♪

33:55.965 --> 33:58.533
Hey, don't move.

33:59.802 --> 34:01.703
(groans)
I'm fine, I'm fine.

34:01.804 --> 34:03.005
All right, where
does it hurt?

34:03.106 --> 34:04.339
Everywhere.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.475
Okay.

34:06.576 --> 34:08.476
That's actually good,
I think I'm healing.

34:08.578 --> 34:10.812
(groans)

34:10.913 --> 34:13.748
But not very fast.

34:13.850 --> 34:17.585
Guess my stupid plan
wasn't so stupid after all.

34:17.687 --> 34:20.022
That was your plan,
getting hit by a truck?

34:20.123 --> 34:22.991
To make you go primal
to stop Bob, yeah.

34:23.092 --> 34:26.194
How'd you know that
I would turn back?

34:26.295 --> 34:29.197
Banked on you trusting
in Cat's love,

34:29.297 --> 34:30.899
whether she was here
or not.

34:32.969 --> 34:36.605
Frankly, it was a Hail Mary,
for both of us.

34:38.708 --> 34:39.775
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:39.876 --> 34:41.208
You're burning
up, man.

34:41.310 --> 34:43.078
Come on, I'm gonna get
you to a hospital.

34:43.179 --> 34:44.539
Come on, let's get
you out of here.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.081
All right, slowly, slowly.

34:46.181 --> 34:47.181
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

34:48.453 --> 34:49.553
Vincent, y-you keep breaking up.

34:49.654 --> 34:52.155
Is JT okay or not?

34:52.257 --> 34:55.993
I don't understand, what do you
mean he didn't heal all the way?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.061
Vincent's safe.
Yeah, he called me.

34:58.162 --> 34:59.696
But JT's gonna be okay, right?

35:00.965 --> 35:03.333
Okay, good, thank you.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.636
What? V-Vincent,
if you can hear me,

35:05.737 --> 35:08.538
call me back when you're
in range, okay? Hel...?

35:08.640 --> 35:11.642
All right, at least
they're on their way back,

35:11.743 --> 35:13.243
and they're fine.

35:13.344 --> 35:14.344
Well, no.

35:14.345 --> 35:15.625
Apparently, JT is not so fine...

35:15.647 --> 35:17.214
Tess...

35:17.315 --> 35:19.216
JT is going to be okay.

35:20.585 --> 35:22.519
Yeah, until I kick his ass.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.356
I don't...
I don't know, Cat.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.825
With all this crap
going on, maybe I am

35:28.926 --> 35:30.227
just not cut out
for this job.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.729
What? Are you kidding?

35:32.830 --> 35:34.665
Tess, you were
born for this job.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.199
Yeah?

35:36.301 --> 35:37.901
Then why do I feel like
I'm having a heart attack?

35:38.002 --> 35:40.837
That is probably because you
are dating a hypochondriac.

35:40.938 --> 35:42.039
(snorts)

35:46.144 --> 35:47.778
I'm really sorry
that I doubted you

35:47.879 --> 35:49.780
about the whole Bob
and Carol thing, Cat.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.561
Forget it, we've already
talked about this.

35:51.616 --> 35:53.617
Still, it won't
be the last time

35:53.718 --> 35:55.352
something like this
happens, you know?

35:55.453 --> 35:57.187
And we got to
figure it out, too,

35:57.288 --> 35:58.922
because now that
I'm captain...

35:59.023 --> 36:01.124
You've got a job to do,
I get it.

36:01.225 --> 36:03.360
And we will figure it out--
we have to.

36:03.461 --> 36:06.196
Example-- with Carol in custody,

36:06.297 --> 36:08.632
we just busted the killer
of a DHS agent.

36:08.733 --> 36:11.535
That's a pretty good-sized
feather in the cap

36:11.636 --> 36:13.537
of a new captain,
wouldn't you say?

36:13.638 --> 36:14.938
I like it.

36:15.039 --> 36:16.406
See how well it can work?

36:19.310 --> 36:21.078
Does Carol know
what happened to Bob, yet?

36:21.179 --> 36:23.313
No.

36:23.414 --> 36:25.615
But I think I'd rather you
be with me when I tell her.

36:25.717 --> 36:26.717
Okay.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.145
No...

37:06.424 --> 37:08.024
Carol!

37:12.597 --> 37:14.831
Somebody call an ambulance!

37:14.932 --> 37:16.433
Tess, it won't work.

37:16.534 --> 37:17.667
What do you mean?

37:17.769 --> 37:19.102
She knew she lost him.

37:19.203 --> 37:20.303
She stopped her heart.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.305
She's not gonna start it again.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.141
The hell
you talking about?

37:24.242 --> 37:26.143
Tess,

37:26.244 --> 37:27.711
I know Carol.

37:27.812 --> 37:30.147
She loved Bob
more than anything.

37:34.318 --> 37:36.887
Looks like they were
inseparable after all.

37:48.733 --> 37:51.635
What, is it, like,
9,000 degrees in here?

37:51.736 --> 37:54.671
No, no, don't touch that--
I-I'm freezing.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.406
How are you possibly freezing?
And are you all right?

37:56.507 --> 37:57.641
Vincent said
that you couldn't heal.

37:57.742 --> 37:58.875
He took me to the hospital,

37:58.976 --> 37:59.976
took some X-rays.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.579
No broken bones.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.381
So you can still
heal yourself.

38:04.482 --> 38:05.816
I don't know--
I don't think so.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.517
Otherwise, I wouldn't
still be in so much pain.

38:07.618 --> 38:10.086
Getting hit by a truck

38:10.188 --> 38:13.223
must have pushed my healing
power past its limit.

38:13.324 --> 38:14.357
So, by shocking
your system...

38:14.459 --> 38:15.459
I overloaded the serum.

38:15.526 --> 38:16.760
Maybe even burned it out.

38:16.861 --> 38:19.696
Although I still
don't know why...

38:19.797 --> 38:21.865
I'm fluctuating
between burning up

38:21.966 --> 38:23.266
and freezing now.

38:23.367 --> 38:25.268
But you're gonna
be okay, right?

38:25.369 --> 38:28.338
No more crazy powers,
healing, night vision?

38:28.439 --> 38:30.340
I got to run some tests
to be sure,

38:30.441 --> 38:33.643
but, yeah, I think
I'm gonna be okay.

38:34.779 --> 38:36.713
Good.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.448
Ow...

38:38.549 --> 38:40.083
What'd you do that for?

38:40.184 --> 38:41.585
Because if you ever
do something stupid

38:41.686 --> 38:43.253
like that again, I'll
run you over, got it?

38:43.354 --> 38:45.055
Yeah.
Great.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.793
And, by the way,

38:49.894 --> 38:51.061
I love you, too.

39:04.909 --> 39:09.246
I don't suppose you got
those concert tickets, yet.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.615
Concert tickets?

39:11.716 --> 39:14.918
Oh, you mean on the 25th at
the Garden, sixth row, center.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.319
Done.

39:16.420 --> 39:17.754
Really?
Really.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.055
Yes.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.057
See what happens
when I'm not obsessed

39:21.158 --> 39:22.893
with things that go
bump in the night?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.895
I know, but I think
we should still be

39:24.996 --> 39:26.396
a little bit worried,
considering.

39:26.497 --> 39:28.832
Especially now that we know
whoever's behind it all

39:28.933 --> 39:30.901
was after me.

39:31.002 --> 39:33.270
Except, I don't think that
they know who you are, yet.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.939
It doesn't sound like Bob and
Carol got a chance to tell them.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.008
Yes, but eventually
they're gonna figure it out.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.242
And when they do, then...

39:39.343 --> 39:41.244
What, so you're
the worrywart now?

39:41.345 --> 39:43.647
What happened to not
wanting the world's evils

39:43.748 --> 39:45.248
to overwhelm our lives?

39:45.349 --> 39:47.651
Okay, I think you enjoyed
this separation thing

39:47.752 --> 39:49.085
a little bit too much.

39:49.186 --> 39:52.689
I admit, it was nice
not having to save

39:52.790 --> 39:54.724
your primal hide for once.

39:56.627 --> 39:57.861
You really did that
all on your own?

39:57.962 --> 40:00.730
Just like you got Carol
on your own.

40:03.568 --> 40:07.304
You know, maybe there is
hope for us yet.

40:09.974 --> 40:12.976
Would you ever stop
your heart for me?

40:14.645 --> 40:17.213
Every time I see you.

40:18.549 --> 40:19.883
Aw...
