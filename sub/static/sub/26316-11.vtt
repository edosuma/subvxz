WEBVTT

00:04.506 --> 00:06.591
Holy forking shirtballs...

00:07.342 --> 00:08.885
we're in the Good Place.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.805
Are we sure we're in the actual Good Place?

00:11.930 --> 00:13.765
It's rather... carpeted.

00:13.932 --> 00:17.352
Yeah, I don't see any go-karts,
much less go-karts being driven by monkeys

00:17.393 --> 00:19.395
wearing sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts.

00:19.521 --> 00:20.438
- What?
- Don't.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.690
No, this is definitely some part
of the Good Place.

00:22.774 --> 00:24.192
Just take a deep breath.

00:25.110 --> 00:26.069
Whoa.

00:26.402 --> 00:30.031
That smells like Typhoon Falls,
my favourite water park when I was a kid!

00:30.240 --> 00:33.743
Mmm. Chlorine, sun tan lotion, Band-Aids

00:33.785 --> 00:36.454
and a thick cloud of teen hormones.

00:36.579 --> 00:39.124
When I was researching my fake Neighbourhood,
I learned about this.

00:39.332 --> 00:42.127
The Good Place smells like
whatever makes you happiest.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.962
Warm pretzels.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.588
Or, no, wait...

00:46.381 --> 00:49.134
it's the smell of absolute moral truth?

00:49.300 --> 00:50.468
Those two things have very similar smells.

00:50.677 --> 00:54.514
I smell... Blake Bortles holding
the Super Bowl MVP trophy

00:54.722 --> 00:57.600
as Dan Patrick says,
"This has to feel good, Blake"

00:57.684 --> 00:59.435
and he says "It sure does, Dan.

00:59.561 --> 01:03.064
And I owe it all to my best friend,
Jason Mendoza."

01:03.231 --> 01:04.232
Also weed.

01:04.315 --> 01:09.529
Mmm, to me it smells like a curtain closing
between first class and economy.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.906
Oh! This truly is the Good Place!

01:11.948 --> 01:15.410
I don't think we're in the main
Good Place area.

01:15.493 --> 01:18.913
This seems like this is some kind of a...
mail depot.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.292
So we're talkin' about mailmen now?
From heaven?

01:22.750 --> 01:25.461
Literally had that calendar,
and I did not get past March.

01:25.545 --> 01:26.504
- What?
- Don't.

01:26.588 --> 01:29.674
OK, there are two key things
that we have to do.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.760
- Make sure that no one can follow us. Janet?
- On it.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.348
What's the second thing we have to do?

01:38.016 --> 01:39.475
Keep a low profile.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.236
OK, if there's anyone in the building,
here's our cover story.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.239
I'm an accountant.
Um, you are a Neutral Janet.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.533
And you four...

01:55.909 --> 01:57.118
won a contest.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.536
- Really?
- Really?

01:58.578 --> 02:00.997
OK, not that.
I-I'll come up with something better.

02:01.039 --> 02:02.624
Well, why do we need a cover story at all?

02:02.707 --> 02:06.085
These are the good guys.
Let's just come clean and request asylum.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.420
Yeah, man, we're refugees.

02:07.503 --> 02:10.089
What kind of messed-up place
would turn away refugees?

02:10.381 --> 02:12.467
The main thing I've learned
about the Good Place

02:12.550 --> 02:14.719
is that they never break the rules

02:14.844 --> 02:18.723
no way to guarantee they wouldn't send you
right down to the Bad Place.

02:18.765 --> 02:20.558
What the heck is going on in there?

02:21.684 --> 02:24.354
Oh! Hi, there! Um, I'm an accountant.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.439
We're coming from Accounting, um...

02:26.564 --> 02:28.983
and as we were, uh, climbing through the...

02:29.067 --> 02:31.194
the mailbox, it... it blew up!

02:31.319 --> 02:33.488
Uh... The explosion was caused by demons.

02:33.655 --> 02:35.240
We were being chased by demons.

02:35.281 --> 02:38.034
And a Dracula!
There was a Dracula chasing us.

02:39.369 --> 02:40.703
Was there, though, Jason?

02:40.828 --> 02:41.746
Yeah.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.666
Maybe Drac blew up the mailbox!
With his bazooka.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.255
Well, geez Louise, I'm sure glad you're OK!

02:50.755 --> 02:53.758
My name's Gwendolyn.
Welcome to the Good Place!

02:53.800 --> 02:57.011
I'm Michael, and, uh,
this is my Neutral Janet.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.180
Hello. Also, not hello.

02:59.222 --> 03:02.225
It's nothing to meet you. End of statement.

03:02.475 --> 03:05.144
OK. And these four here are humans.

03:05.561 --> 03:06.521
If you can believe it!

03:06.562 --> 03:07.730
"If" I can believe it!

03:07.814 --> 03:09.816
Watch this - I believe it!

03:11.025 --> 03:12.193
Why are they here?

03:13.361 --> 03:15.238
Because they won a contest.

03:19.158 --> 03:20.743
Congratulations, guys!

03:21.244 --> 03:22.370
Come on in!

03:22.453 --> 03:25.081
This is the correspondence centre.

03:25.123 --> 03:29.043
Make yourselves at home. There's a sofa,
that's a bowl of fruit...

03:29.127 --> 03:32.547
that's the door to the Good Place...
ooh, there's a fun paperweight

03:32.588 --> 03:34.173
shaped like a little hat!

03:34.215 --> 03:38.845
I'm sorry, uh... this right here is...
is the door to, um, the Good Place?

03:38.886 --> 03:43.266
Well, it's a door to the Good Place,
but it won't open for you guys, though.

03:43.433 --> 03:46.644
The only door for humans
is the Official Entrance

03:46.686 --> 03:49.188
which is 500 trillion miles
north-south-north of here.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.232
So you're kinda just stuck inside.

03:52.025 --> 03:52.942
Wow.

03:53.276 --> 03:57.196
It's really weird that you guys won
a contest to be in this building...

03:57.238 --> 04:01.784
Um, you know, take that up with the folks
at Weird Contest Magazine.

04:01.826 --> 04:04.454
Hey, why don't we help you clean
up the mess in the mailroom?

04:04.495 --> 04:07.123
Wow, thanks! Did I win a contest?

04:10.209 --> 04:11.544
Chidi and I will be right there!

04:14.630 --> 04:16.466
- Chidi, help me!
- She said it's not gonna open.

04:16.716 --> 04:17.633
Fine.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.056
Eleanor!

04:23.097 --> 04:25.683
What? This is how I always got out
of escape rooms.

04:25.767 --> 04:28.269
If you break enough stuff,
they open the door and kick you out!

04:28.436 --> 04:29.854
Is everything OK in there?

04:31.230 --> 04:32.106
Yep!

04:32.190 --> 04:34.359
OK! No follow-up questions!

04:34.442 --> 04:35.818
Hey there, Smashy.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.112
Before you start grabbin' any other
throwin' lamps

04:38.196 --> 04:41.449
- you have anything you need to talk about?
- I can't take this anymore, man.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.659
All the running, and hiding, and fighting

04:43.743 --> 04:46.788
and this whole insane journey,
and now all that stands between us

04:46.829 --> 04:48.915
and the actual Good Place is one door!

04:49.040 --> 04:50.666
What is that, two inches thick?

04:50.708 --> 04:55.046
That's like four Oreos!
We're four Oreos from heaven!

04:55.129 --> 04:56.881
I know, I know, I know.

04:57.215 --> 05:01.677
It's an insane situation,
but I am right here with you.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.055
So, let's take a deep breath.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.100
- Mm...
- Hm.

05:07.183 --> 05:08.059
OK.

05:08.101 --> 05:11.145
The smell of the barf from the wave pool
is really helping.

05:11.646 --> 05:12.647
How?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.191
- Mm...
- Why?

05:16.067 --> 05:17.568
- Say, Gwendolyn.
- Hm?

05:17.652 --> 05:20.822
I need to speak with the Committee,
regarding an urgent matter.

05:20.905 --> 05:23.533
Oh, sorry,
you'd have to contact them directly

05:23.616 --> 05:25.451
and that's definitely against the rules.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.494
I see.

05:26.911 --> 05:30.248
How would I contact them, though,
if it weren't against the rules?

05:30.289 --> 05:31.916
Well, by calling them on that phone!

05:32.417 --> 05:33.960
- But I can't let ya use it.
- Right.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.963
And even if it weren't against the rules,
I don't know the number

05:37.046 --> 05:38.256
and you wouldn't tell me.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.715
I couldn't!

05:39.799 --> 05:41.134
There are no numbers.

05:41.217 --> 05:43.845
You pick it up and it connects you
to whomever you want!

05:43.928 --> 05:46.055
But, you can't use it.

05:46.139 --> 05:47.265
Of course not!

05:47.432 --> 05:49.350
- Just as a hypothetical...
- Mm-hm?

05:49.475 --> 05:53.312
Is there any way that you would know
if I did use the phone?

05:53.438 --> 05:55.064
Any kind of alarm?

05:55.231 --> 05:56.315
Golly, no!

05:56.357 --> 05:58.443
So it's entirely untraceable?

05:58.484 --> 05:59.360
Sure is!

05:59.444 --> 06:01.154
What a fun thought experiment!

06:01.446 --> 06:03.072
- You said it, Gwendolyn.
- Uh-huh.

06:03.156 --> 06:07.076
Oh, sorry,
is that a dog barking in another room?

06:07.118 --> 06:09.328
I doubt it, because I don't have a dog.

06:09.579 --> 06:13.583
But out of politeness and an abundance
of caution, I'll go check!

06:13.749 --> 06:16.502
Hello? Doggie?

06:17.253 --> 06:19.547
My name is Michael. I'm an Accountant.

06:19.589 --> 06:21.966
I need to speak with the Committee,
immediately

06:22.049 --> 06:24.719
on the top floor
of the Correspondence Centre.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.053
Thank you.

06:31.476 --> 06:33.352
Jason, you seem thoughtful

06:33.686 --> 06:35.396
and that concerns me.

06:35.438 --> 06:38.232
Do you remember that one time,
when we were in Janet's void

06:38.274 --> 06:39.901
and we all looked like Janet?

06:40.610 --> 06:42.195
I do, yes.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.655
You know how I saw that thing
about how Janet loves me?

06:44.989 --> 06:49.118
I don't know how I feel about her,
and also I feel bad that I sort of, like

06:49.243 --> 06:51.412
read her diary, and she doesn't know.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.832
- What should I do?
- Well, perhaps you should tell Janet

06:54.916 --> 06:58.544
what you saw,
and start a dialogue about your feelings.

06:58.628 --> 07:02.965
Who knows if a relationship will take hold,
but you must begin from a place of honesty.

07:03.049 --> 07:04.342
Thanks, Tahani.

07:04.759 --> 07:07.553
It's nice to know I can talk about girls
with my wife.

07:09.096 --> 07:09.972
Hey, Janet!

07:10.431 --> 07:13.893
Uh, so, do you remember how you killed us
and brought us into your void?

07:13.976 --> 07:14.977
I do, yes.

07:15.144 --> 07:20.191
When we were in there, I was wandering around
because you have the ability to make anything

07:20.274 --> 07:22.360
and I wanted to see where you
keep the rollerblades

07:22.527 --> 07:26.489
and I accidentally saw that video thing
about how you love me.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.283
You saw that? That's so embarrassing.

07:29.325 --> 07:32.954
I mean, it kinda freaked me out at first.
But, hey, let's talk about it.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.163
I don't want to talk about this.

07:34.664 --> 07:38.501
You guys were in my void
and it was exhausting and I almost blew up

07:38.543 --> 07:42.046
and I have to be neutral,
and Neutral Janets don't have feelings...

07:42.129 --> 07:43.256
How's it going in here?

07:43.381 --> 07:46.175
It is going neutrally. End of conversation.

07:46.259 --> 07:48.302
- Can we--
- End of conversation.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.389
You got one shot, buddy.

07:51.847 --> 07:56.644
Be clear, be confident,
and don't let them intimidate you.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.897
Oh, wow!

07:59.981 --> 08:03.526
- Wow, this place is very cool!
- Have you guys ever been here before?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.444
- I have never been here before!
- No, no, no.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.239
I love it! So charming!

08:08.364 --> 08:12.076
Hello, everyone, I'm Michael.
Thank you for coming.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.620
No, thank you for asking us to come!

08:14.912 --> 08:19.625
It is one of the great honours
of my eternal life to be invited here

08:19.667 --> 08:22.169
by you, today, for this momentous occasion.

08:22.295 --> 08:23.212
Now...

08:23.629 --> 08:25.631
Who are you, and why are we here?

08:25.756 --> 08:31.429
Well, in a nutshell, I believe that
the Bad Place has somehow infiltrated

08:31.512 --> 08:35.182
the Accounting Department,
and is tampering with the points system.

08:35.433 --> 08:38.144
My goodness. That would be a disaster.

08:38.394 --> 08:40.980
Everyone, focus up. Meg, you take notes.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.858
Daisuke? Open a secure channel
to headquarters.

08:43.941 --> 08:47.153
Kellen? Head to the farmer's market
and grab us fresh peaches.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.779
I think pluots are in season.

08:48.821 --> 08:50.156
Well, then get pluots, Kellen.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.908
Get as many pluots as can fit
in your tote bag.

08:52.992 --> 08:54.577
We are gonna be here a while.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.748
Brought you some water.
Well, I mean there's not a kitchen

08:58.831 --> 09:02.627
but I found this kind of glowing bowl,
with liquid in it?

09:02.752 --> 09:04.253
Maybe it was a toilet.
I'm gonna throw this out.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.630
What are you doing?

09:05.713 --> 09:09.675
Trying to jimmy the lock, but everything
I stick in here just turns to glitter.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.762
- Ugh!
- Alright, forget about the door, look at me.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.680
Right now, we're together

09:14.764 --> 09:18.142
in heaven, basically, and we're in love.

09:18.517 --> 09:21.771
Compared to some of the other stuff
that's happened to us, it could be worse.

09:21.812 --> 09:26.150
I guess "try and enjoy this" is a better plan
than "have the anxiety sweats".

09:26.442 --> 09:28.694
Oh, check it out,
straight through my sweatshirt.

09:28.736 --> 09:32.031
Cool. Hey! I have an idea
to take your mind off the door.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.616
- Let's go on a date.
- What?

09:33.741 --> 09:39.038
No, I'm serious. Why not have our first
date four Oreos away from paradise?

09:39.163 --> 09:41.999
You still wanna go out with me after
I just showed you my anxiety sweats?

09:42.208 --> 09:44.126
Man, you must really be into me.

09:44.543 --> 09:49.256
You have to admit, it's very odd that
no one has gotten into the Good Place

09:49.298 --> 09:50.758
for 500 years.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.677
Mm, well, there've been dips before.

09:52.718 --> 09:55.805
Remember, like, 200,000 years ago
when they invented stabbing

09:55.846 --> 09:57.848
and they were all just, like,
stabbing each other?

09:57.932 --> 10:00.059
Again, I urge you to look at Doug Forcett.

10:00.226 --> 10:05.356
The man has lived a selfless life,
and he's not even close to getting in.

10:05.606 --> 10:10.903
The only explanation is that the Bad Place
has somehow rigged the system.

10:10.986 --> 10:15.783
I wouldn't put it past them. Every single
Bad Place employee is a disgusting monster.

10:16.117 --> 10:18.828
Well... some of them are probably cool

10:18.953 --> 10:20.871
handsome, "man-about-town" types.

10:21.288 --> 10:25.835
Committee! Michael the Accountant
has brought us evidence of a problem

10:26.085 --> 10:28.587
and now it is up to us to find a solution.

10:28.671 --> 10:32.007
While you wait, Kellen will stand by you,
showering you with compliments.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.594
Great job, Michael.
You are such a good speaker.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.639
This suit is very flattering.
You have a lot of gravitas.

10:38.681 --> 10:42.643
I thought I was going to be annoyed by this,
but it... it's wonderful.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.646
Your jawline is extraordinary.
You're a nice height.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.648
Your energy is electric.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.820
I gotta say, it's been really nice
having a little company.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.321
It's nice to be here.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.616
And it's not nice, to not be there.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.454
So, how'd you two meet?
Was it through the contest?

11:01.495 --> 11:03.330
Tahani and I met in brain school

11:03.414 --> 11:05.833
and then we got married,
because nothing mattered.

11:05.875 --> 11:09.420
And you're both so attractive!
Are all humans as attractive as you two?

11:11.297 --> 11:13.048
- No.
- Oh! Fantastic.

11:13.132 --> 11:16.594
Say, Jason, can you help me get more
wicker baskets from the other room?

11:16.677 --> 11:17.720
Sure thing.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.389
I'm so sorry, darling,
this is all my fault.

11:20.431 --> 11:23.350
I encouraged Jason to come clean
about what we saw.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.477
You saw that too?

11:25.144 --> 11:26.979
No.

11:27.062 --> 11:30.524
Jason knows that I love him, it stinks
to hear about how the two of you are married

11:31.108 --> 11:33.986
this beige outfit really washes out
my not-skin

11:34.028 --> 11:36.405
and if I don't remain "neutral"
in front of Gwendolyn

11:36.447 --> 11:37.656
she's gonna know we've been lying!

11:37.698 --> 11:40.284
All of these new emotions I'm feeling
are about to burst out of me

11:40.326 --> 11:42.036
which might be super embarrassing!

11:42.578 --> 11:44.622
What if they come out my butt?

11:50.503 --> 11:51.587
Whoa! Champagne!

11:51.670 --> 11:53.339
Found it in the cupboard.
I think it was a gift.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.883
I feel kinda bad. What if it was for
something really important?

11:55.925 --> 11:58.552
"Gwendolyn, here's some champagne for you
for thanking me

11:58.594 --> 12:01.388
for thanking you for thanking me
for thanking you for thanking me

12:01.430 --> 12:02.807
for the champagne you sent me."

12:02.890 --> 12:04.517
Pop that bench.

12:06.185 --> 12:08.020
This is my kind of scrappy fun.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.398
Sneaking around with a boy,
trying not to get caught...

12:11.649 --> 12:15.444
I know, it's like when my parents
would go to a symposium

12:15.569 --> 12:19.406
and I would sneak into their office
and read the unabridged dictionary.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.409
I can't believe I'm attracted to you.

12:22.493 --> 12:23.410
You are, though.

12:23.494 --> 12:25.913
I'm not worried about that anymore.
You blew it when you admitted it to me.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.667
You still thinking about
what's on the other side of that door?

12:29.959 --> 12:31.335
Not really, no.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.213
Because you're here with me, on this side.

12:35.714 --> 12:40.636
I have... one more little surprise for you.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.304
OK, open 'em.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.351
Holy forking fork.

12:47.643 --> 12:48.894
What do you think?

12:52.398 --> 12:54.149
Oh, no, you're crying!

12:54.400 --> 12:55.985
I assume it's because you're happy?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.653
Or horny? Is this a horny-cry?

12:57.695 --> 13:00.906
No! I'm crying because I'm miserable,
and it's all your fault.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.325
- Why! Do you not like the outfit?
- I love the outfit!

13:03.409 --> 13:06.579
You look amazing!
And this sucks, and I'm furious!

13:06.662 --> 13:09.874
And I'm the happiest I've ever been,
and I blame you!

13:13.544 --> 13:17.381
In light of this new information,
the time has come to take decisive action.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.507
Wow.

13:18.883 --> 13:21.927
Can't tell you how happy I am
to hear you say that.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.639
We are gonna form an elite investigative
team to get to the bottom of this.

13:25.723 --> 13:27.516
And we are fast-tracking the process.

13:27.558 --> 13:30.686
It'll take no more than 400 years.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.606
- Sorry?
- It's aggressive, but you heard right.

13:33.731 --> 13:38.402
We are only giving ourselves 400 years
to select the members of this elite team.

13:38.444 --> 13:41.322
Wait, 400 years just to form the team?

13:41.447 --> 13:43.699
I was thinking that we could do something...
now-ish.

13:43.741 --> 13:47.494
- Like, right now.
- Michael, we have rules, procedures.

13:47.620 --> 13:51.206
- We're the Good Guys. We can't just do stuff!
- No.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.959
Upon formation,
the team will then be in charge of organising

13:54.001 --> 13:57.212
a Blue Ribbon Commission to investigate...

13:57.463 --> 13:59.798
Themselves, to make sure
there's no conflicts of interest.

14:00.049 --> 14:02.635
And that will take 1,000 years.

14:02.676 --> 14:03.552
OK.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.640
Just so you know,
the whole time you're doing this

14:07.806 --> 14:13.979
the bad guys are continuing to torture
everyone who ends up in the Bad Place.

14:14.063 --> 14:16.190
Which is everyone!

14:16.273 --> 14:18.108
And that deeply concerns us.

14:18.192 --> 14:21.278
Have you seen the memoranda we've sent
each other about how concerned we are?

14:21.445 --> 14:24.073
- We're taking this very seriously.
- Hear, hear.

14:24.156 --> 14:27.117
Ooh, Kellen. Did you file a "Hear, Hear"
memorandum?

14:27.493 --> 14:29.328
No. Sincerest apologies.

14:29.370 --> 14:32.748
I rescind my "Hear, hear" and resign,
effective immediately.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.255
Hey, you two. I think I may have solved
one part of our little problem.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.550
I made up a "Death Did Us Part" certificate

14:43.759 --> 14:48.305
explaining that since Jason and I are dead,
we are officially no longer fake-married.

14:48.514 --> 14:52.017
I know it's not your main concern,
but whatever part of you was vexed

14:52.059 --> 14:55.354
by our silly arrangement,
you can now both relax.

14:55.813 --> 14:59.775
I can tell by your silence and inability
to make eye contact with me

14:59.817 --> 15:01.735
that I've knocked it out the park.

15:01.777 --> 15:02.903
It's a nice gesture.

15:03.028 --> 15:06.240
I feel both pitied and
put on the spot, so...

15:06.991 --> 15:07.866
that's fun.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.912
And it's a cool reminder
of how I'm... dead.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.622
Well, forget it! Never mind.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.290
Misfire. Watch this!

15:17.001 --> 15:18.585
There. Cancelled.

15:18.711 --> 15:20.629
- So, you and I are married again?
- No, we're not.

15:20.838 --> 15:21.714
Um...

15:23.048 --> 15:24.967
Eugh!

15:25.884 --> 15:27.594
It's OK.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.596
Cry as long as you want.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.348
I'm going to.

15:32.516 --> 15:36.145
Cos my tears taste like the nacho cheese
from my favourite movie theatre.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.897
It's a really weird
incentive to keep crying.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.525
Ugh. Relationships are stupid.

15:41.859 --> 15:44.069
You're scared
you're never gonna have a real one

15:44.278 --> 15:47.031
and then when you do,
you're scared it's gonna go away.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.951
Here's an idea, what if we don't worry
about whatever comes next?

15:51.410 --> 15:54.580
There's a quote I like by Tolstoy.

15:54.747 --> 15:58.125
"There is only one time that is important.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.003
Now. It is the only time..."

16:01.128 --> 16:02.713
"...when we have any power."

16:02.880 --> 16:04.131
I know that quote.

16:04.173 --> 16:07.468
An unverified Tyra Banks account
posted that meme on Instagram.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.512
Well, now I hate it.

16:10.721 --> 16:15.809
There is another quote,
first spoken by a very wise

16:15.976 --> 16:21.440
very attractive,
occasionally very sweaty philosopher

16:22.107 --> 16:23.233
"You gotta try."

16:24.443 --> 16:27.154
Now, she was talking about
making the world a better place, but...

16:27.571 --> 16:29.656
I think it applies to relationships too.

16:30.074 --> 16:32.117
I've got an idea of something we could try.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.660
Great! What?

16:35.120 --> 16:35.996
Oh!

16:36.622 --> 16:37.873
Wait, I-I think I know...

16:38.624 --> 16:39.750
Well, I don't wanna assume.

16:40.042 --> 16:43.879
What if we both write down
what we think you mean...

16:43.921 --> 16:45.547
- What if we didn't?
- OK, ooh, ah...

16:48.342 --> 16:49.676
Michael?

16:49.927 --> 16:52.221
How did it go?
Is the Committee going to help us?

16:52.304 --> 16:56.225
The Committee is a bunch of
ineffectual dorks in fleece vests.

16:56.308 --> 17:01.313
The Titanic is sinking, and they're writing
a strongly worded letter to the iceberg.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.191
How much more evidence do they need?

17:04.233 --> 17:07.069
The Bad Place has to be tampering
with the system!

17:07.611 --> 17:09.113
There's no other explanation.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.949
Can I ask you an unrelated question?

17:12.032 --> 17:15.661
Absolutely not!
The fate of all of humanity is at stake

17:15.702 --> 17:17.162
and time is running out!

17:19.790 --> 17:20.707
Go ahead.

17:20.833 --> 17:24.128
I'm trying to help Jason and Janet
navigate some very complex feelings

17:24.169 --> 17:25.921
but everything I do makes it worse.

17:26.255 --> 17:29.133
You know them better than anyone else,
how do I just make them happy?

17:29.216 --> 17:30.884
How do you make Jason happy?

17:31.218 --> 17:34.179
You give him a lollipop
shaped like a Transformer.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.014
You'd think it'd be that simple

17:36.098 --> 17:39.852
but every time I do something nice,
it backfires.

17:40.018 --> 17:44.148
There are so many unintended consequences
to well-intentioned actions.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.192
It feels like a game you can't win!

17:47.818 --> 17:48.694
That's it.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.030
There is another explanation.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.742
Unintended consequences.
Oh, Tahani... you did it!

17:55.868 --> 17:57.286
Well, of course I did, darling!

17:58.328 --> 17:59.246
Did what?

17:59.288 --> 18:01.498
All along,
I've only been looking at one Doug

18:01.665 --> 18:05.335
but there's... millions of Dougs in here.

18:08.172 --> 18:11.592
In 1534,
Douglass Wynegar of Hawkhurst, England

18:11.633 --> 18:14.261
gave his grandmother
roses for her birthday.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.847
He picked them himself,
walked them over to her

18:16.930 --> 18:19.600
she was happy, boom, 145 points.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.644
Now... Yeah, here we go.

18:24.479 --> 18:28.066
In 2009, Doug Ewing of
Scaggsville, Maryland

18:28.317 --> 18:31.486
also gave his grandmother a dozen roses

18:31.695 --> 18:34.489
but he lost four points!

18:34.656 --> 18:39.828
Why? Because he ordered roses using
a cell-phone that was made in a sweatshop

18:40.370 --> 18:45.792
the flowers were grown with toxic pesticides,
picked by exploited migrant workers

18:45.918 --> 18:50.714
delivered from thousands of miles away,
which created a massive carbon footprint

18:50.756 --> 18:53.884
and his money went to a billionaire
racist CEO

18:53.967 --> 18:58.138
who sends his female employees
pictures of his genitals!

18:58.263 --> 18:59.389
Woo!

18:59.723 --> 19:01.808
That is a very odd thing to cheer.

19:01.892 --> 19:04.770
Don't you understand?
The Bad Place isn't tampering with points.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.941
They don't have to! Because every day,
the world gets a little more complicated

19:08.982 --> 19:12.110
and being a good person
gets a little harder.

19:12.653 --> 19:15.864
- Gather the others. We have a lot to do.
- But we really didn't deal with my thing...

19:16.907 --> 19:17.824
OK.

19:17.908 --> 19:20.369
I'll just... figure it out.

19:22.079 --> 19:25.832
Janet, I owe you an apology.
I'm very sorry I meddled.

19:25.916 --> 19:29.002
Truly, I was only trying to help,
because I want you two to be happy

19:29.169 --> 19:31.922
and because, well, I love you.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.841
I really do. I love you both.

19:36.385 --> 19:39.012
Oh no! I'm sorry,
did I say something wrong again?

19:39.096 --> 19:42.015
No, I'm just crying because
you're such a nice and thoughtful friend

19:42.307 --> 19:44.059
and the emotions aren't
coming out of my butt

19:44.142 --> 19:46.812
they're coming out of my eyes,
which is somehow just as embarrassing.

19:47.396 --> 19:48.605
Why are you crying?

19:48.730 --> 19:51.775
I don't know.
I'm British, I... I... I never cry.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.529
But you're saying these nice things about me,
and it's making me cry!

19:55.862 --> 19:57.489
And also, this is less important

19:57.572 --> 19:59.992
but the carpeting is really disgusting.

20:00.409 --> 20:01.994
Oh!

20:06.164 --> 20:07.541
Why are you crying?

20:07.624 --> 20:10.127
I just like being a part of things!

20:10.377 --> 20:12.045
Oh...

20:12.462 --> 20:16.383
Two humans and a Neutral Janet crying?
In the Good Place?

20:16.633 --> 20:20.679
I've never been suspicious of anyone,
but I think that's about to change...

20:20.721 --> 20:24.558
Oh, no reason to be suspicious!
I-I promise you, we've done nothing untoward.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.561
What's up, fartfaces?
Chidi and I just had sex in a closet.

20:29.104 --> 20:32.065
Michael, have you all been lying to me
this whole time?

20:32.357 --> 20:35.652
That upsets me!
I'm gonna try to shake my fist at you!

20:36.445 --> 20:38.280
D'oh, gosh darn it!

20:38.447 --> 20:41.366
I have no choice.
I have to turn you in to the Judge.

20:41.450 --> 20:43.744
Don't bother. I already did.

20:45.746 --> 20:46.997
Hey, Frogman.

20:47.205 --> 20:50.000
The Judge agreed to your terms.
She'll meet you at IHOP.

20:50.459 --> 20:52.961
So this is the Good Place, huh? Hm.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.590
Smells like frogs.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.551
Cool. Let's go.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.762
Sorry, did he just say we're going to IHOP?

21:02.137 --> 21:03.221
- Yes.
- Tight!

21:03.305 --> 21:04.639
No, not tight.

21:04.723 --> 21:08.769
The Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes
is the most dangerous place in the universe.

21:08.935 --> 21:09.936
Then why are we going?

21:10.395 --> 21:11.730
To save humanity.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.940
Great, any chance I could
change real quick?

21:14.441 --> 21:15.817
- Nope.
- Cool.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.741
Bye, guys! Nice to meet you!
