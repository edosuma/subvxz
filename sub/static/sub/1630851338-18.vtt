♪ ♪

00:47.248 --> 00:49.280
Here you are, sir.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.550
Good luck with the repair.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.018
Thank you.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.178
(distant coughing)

01:26.120 --> 01:29.054
(distant groans)

01:35.830 --> 01:38.597
(crabtree): Good to see
you again, mr. Park.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.566
And you, mrs. Yoo.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.367
Uh, vincent, rachel.

01:42.369 --> 01:44.002
What a lovely home
you have here.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.804
I'm only sorry that
I've been invited

01:45.939 --> 01:47.539
Under such strange
circumstances.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.674
Thank you, constable.

01:49.743 --> 01:53.411
You say you heard a low moaning
sound coming up from the vent?

01:53.447 --> 01:54.880
Yes.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.414
It's over here.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.222
It could have been an intruder.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.691
Ah! Uh.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.362
Hello!

02:12.166 --> 02:13.632
Anybody down there?

02:16.570 --> 02:19.304
If there was somebody, they
seem to have quietened down now.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.106
Perhaps they ran off.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.008
This smells delicious.
What is it?

02:23.944 --> 02:27.179
Constable, about the noise?

02:27.982 --> 02:30.081
Right. Um.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.517
Does the vent lead
down to the store?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.285
No. To the basement.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.994
The air duct must end
down here somewhere.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.329
Yes.
Root cellar.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.409
(all gasp)

02:57.478 --> 02:59.210
(speaking korean)

03:00.914 --> 03:04.315
I think the moans you heard were
this man's last few breaths.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.360
Sir, the young miss rachel park

03:15.495 --> 03:17.562
Telephoned the station
about eight pm

03:17.565 --> 03:20.298
After the family heard
strange moaning sounds

03:20.367 --> 03:21.967
Coming from the vent.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.569
(murdoch): I recognize
mr. Park from church.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.039
He and his wife,
mrs. Yoo.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.375
Good evening.
Detective william murdoch.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.910
We attend the same church, sir.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.513
Yes.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.715
May god receive
the dead man's soul.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.383
Of course.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.387
Do any of you know
who this man is?

03:42.522 --> 03:45.924
Not at all, detective.
We have never seen him before.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.261
And you have no idea how he
came to be in your basement?

03:50.297 --> 03:51.730
No.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.064
(hart):
Detective.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.667
What have you,
mrs. Hart?

03:55.669 --> 03:57.803
Nothing to identify the man.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.538
And no signs of physical
trauma to the body.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.207
It may be poison.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.077
Potato poisoning.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.211
What?

04:06.346 --> 04:09.948
Sir, one time one
of my aunt's, um...

04:10.083 --> 04:12.017
“friends,” let's say,

04:12.086 --> 04:15.420
Well, his wife was very upset
with him, I won't get into why,

04:15.422 --> 04:18.290
But, sir, he hid from her
in the basement of the rectory

04:18.292 --> 04:21.225
Among scads of potatoes,
very nearly died.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.895
From the potatoes?

04:23.964 --> 04:27.632
Yeah, sir, I'm telling you
the improperly stored potato,

04:27.635 --> 04:29.067
Nothing short of a menace.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.970
I eagerly await your
report, mrs. Hart.

05:07.207 --> 05:10.409
(crowd cheers)

05:10.544 --> 05:12.377
Mr. Caraway,
that was marvelous.

05:12.379 --> 05:15.080
The musicians, the athleticism
of the dancers. Margaret?

05:15.082 --> 05:17.081
Oh, it was absolutely wonderful.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.084
Wait until you see
the entire performance.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.019
Exquisite!
Ah, here they are.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.122
Mr. And mrs. Brackenreid,
this is miss klavdia federov

05:24.158 --> 05:25.890
And mr. Dmitri popov.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.492
Ooh.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.160
Charmed.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.464
Mr. Brackenreid is a police
inspector here in toronto.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.232
Pleasure to meet you.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.734
You, too.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.970
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.641
(sighs)

05:43.711 --> 05:45.110
Like what you see?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.511
Uh, sorry. What, thomas?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.113
You've had an eyeful.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.847
- So did you.
- She smiled at me.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.650
- Ha!
- What?

05:51.785 --> 05:53.251
You think she likes you?

05:53.287 --> 05:54.986
Well, there was
a bit of a sparkle.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.989
You really think an old coot
like you has a chance with her?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.991
As much as you think you've
got a chance with him.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.393
I tell you what.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.728
If she'll have you,
be my guest.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.397
Bloody hell, margaret.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.998
And I with him.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.000
(chuckles)

06:09.002 --> 06:11.269
(laughs)

06:11.305 --> 06:13.337
Pigs would sooner fly.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.672
Actually, I've seen that happen.

06:20.114 --> 06:22.747
Well-dressed. It's not
likely he was a vagrant.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.683
Some interesting
stitching here, sir.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.419
It's quite the pattern.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.488
Little stabs.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.889
Beg your pardon?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.490
The embroidering.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.027
It's sashiko.
Japanese.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.863
My friend collects
exotic textiles.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.899
So, he may be japanese?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.569
Gentlemen, I've ascertained
the cause of death.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.137
Ah, potatoes?

06:47.307 --> 06:48.840
Arsenic, I'm afraid.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.508
But there was something else.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.611
The livor mortis shows there
was pooling in the right arm

06:53.680 --> 06:55.180
And the right side of the torso.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.048
Meaning he was lying down.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.583
(crabtree):
But we found him sitting up.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.986
(hart): He'd already been dead
for a couple hours by then.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.655
It's likely he was poisoned
four hours before that,

07:03.657 --> 07:06.758
Based on the amount
of arsenic he ingested.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.595
I'd say he was poisoned at two
o'clock and died at six.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.797
So someone moved the body.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.265
And the family lied
about how quickly

07:14.334 --> 07:15.667
They telephoned
the police.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.703
Oh, and constable? I looked
into your potato theory.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.005
It seems they cause
solanine poisoning.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.207
Apparently, it can
indeed be lethal.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.775
So, it was a factor?

07:25.412 --> 07:26.477
No.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.017
Where were you at two pm
yesterday, mr. Park?

07:32.019 --> 07:35.486
Working at my hardware
store, detective, sir.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.355
My whole family was.

07:38.592 --> 07:42.193
But you were all home at six pm
when the man died.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.063
(deep breath)

07:47.634 --> 07:50.034
When did you begin
to hear moaning sounds

07:50.103 --> 07:51.169
Coming from
the basement?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.438
I don't recall.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.040
Shortly before we
telephoned you.

07:56.376 --> 07:59.644
That leaves a gap of about
two hours, mrs. Yoo.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.513
Impossible.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.516
We also know that
the body was moved.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.322
What? I don't know
anything about that.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.791
How would you explain it?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.393
Perhaps there was
a second intruder.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.929
I find that unlikely.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.933
I can think of no
other explanation.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.936
I can.
You're lying.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.471
My family is innocent, sir.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.275
Finding a dead man in
the house was horrid enough.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.143
We did not touch him.
I swear to you.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.347
The lads have dusted
for fingermarks, sir.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.282
Nothing but the family's
and the dead man's.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.353
So, it's unlikely he was
killed by a second intruder.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.853
Take a look at this, george.

08:44.691 --> 08:49.094
This entire area here
has bits of clay in it,

08:49.229 --> 08:51.228
Unlike anywhere
else.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.431
It's been recently dug up.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.833
It's roughly
the size of a grave.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.369
Do you think somebody tried
to bury the body?

08:58.305 --> 08:59.504
It's possible.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.105
It's possible they started
digging,

09:01.141 --> 09:02.507
Most certainly hit clay,

09:02.576 --> 09:04.508
And it would have
been nearly impossible

09:04.545 --> 09:05.977
To dig deep enough.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.380
But if they were trying
to get rid of the body,

09:08.382 --> 09:10.848
Why give up
and call us?

09:10.918 --> 09:13.250
I mean, they could have
dismembered it,

09:13.287 --> 09:15.320
Or mulched it or--

09:15.322 --> 09:19.057
Perhaps they didn't have
the stomach for that, george.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.993
Or one of them panicked.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.129
Which one of them
telephoned the police?

09:30.537 --> 09:32.003
I told you the truth.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.438
Miss park,

09:36.009 --> 09:38.409
We know that
the body was moved.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.478
And that someone in your
household

09:40.480 --> 09:41.746
Tried to bury the body,

09:41.881 --> 09:45.283
But you then telephoned
the police.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.887
If you don't cooperate, your
whole family could go to jail

09:49.022 --> 09:50.921
For obstructing
a murder investigation.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.627
Yes.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.295
Yes, it's true.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.365
What happened?

10:00.367 --> 10:03.134
We just found him
there, I swear.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.436
But we were afraid.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.106
We would not be seen
favourably in the community

10:08.241 --> 10:09.974
If we reported
a dead body.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.779
We are immigrants from korea.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.048
Please understand, sir.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.685
So, you tried to bury the body.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.121
The ground was too hard.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.125
So, we decided to call the
police and we feigned surprise

10:27.127 --> 10:28.859
When the constable found him.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.198
And you maintain that you have
no idea who this man was?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.133
No.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.336
I swear on the bible
the man was dead

10:38.405 --> 10:39.804
When we found him.

10:39.939 --> 10:42.607
My family committed no murder.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.080
I see. Ah, so,
you believe, then,

10:49.116 --> 10:50.481
That they've been
stolen from you?

10:50.550 --> 10:53.618
Miss federov.
What brings you here?

10:53.620 --> 10:55.954
Inspector! I was actually
looking for you,

10:55.956 --> 11:00.425
But this constable here kept
offering to help me instead.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.027
It's just a robbery sir.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.495
Miss federov, I'd be more
than happy to help.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.531
Oh.
Wonderful!

11:09.269 --> 11:10.702
Higgins, kettle.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.637
Kettle.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.241
Oh, come this way.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.377
I was about to release the body,

11:20.414 --> 11:22.780
But I noticed something
strange about his mouth.

11:22.816 --> 11:26.317
It turns out he had
an ill-fitting false tooth.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.585
And?

11:27.587 --> 11:29.988
I extracted it
and found a hidden reservoir

11:29.990 --> 11:31.856
Containing
cyanide.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.324
(crabtree):
Good gracious.

11:33.326 --> 11:37.795
Why would anybody want to keep
cyanide in their tooth?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.865
Biting down on it
in a particular fashion

11:40.934 --> 11:43.934
Would allow him to
break it open and, essentially,

11:43.970 --> 11:47.071
Kill himself at
a moment's notice.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.140
I've heard of such
a thing being used

11:49.275 --> 11:50.742
In the world
of secret agents.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.479
Sir, you think perhaps
he's a spy?

11:55.482 --> 11:57.949
As much as it pains me
to admit it,

11:57.951 --> 12:00.285
I think we need
to call someone.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.691
Terence meyers.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.028
You called?

12:16.035 --> 12:17.102
(meyers):
You say he was found dead

12:17.237 --> 12:18.970
In the home of a korean family?

12:18.972 --> 12:20.104
That's right.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.441
Korea has been
a protectorate of japan

12:23.443 --> 12:27.178
Ever since the japanese won
the russo-japanese war in 1905.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.314
Korea doesn't care much
for being occupied.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.783
So the japanese are, what?

12:32.819 --> 12:35.787
Sending people to kill korean
families all over the world?

12:36.656 --> 12:38.256
Maybe this family has secrets.

12:39.726 --> 12:43.328
The dead man had a lethal dose
of cyanide hidden in a tooth.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.129
(meyers):
Hm.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.931
So, he is an agent.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.733
But, at the very most,
this is a matter

12:48.868 --> 12:50.802
For east asian
diplomacy.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.671
And canada would have
no interest here.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.606
So, good luck, gentlemen.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.876
You're just going to leave?

12:57.878 --> 13:01.346
I have more important
things to worry about.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.147
Like project iguana.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.316
What's project iguana?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.887
Murdoch, I do have
cases that take place

13:10.023 --> 13:12.223
Outside of this
station house, you know.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.227
If this man is truly a spy,

13:16.263 --> 13:18.763
Then surely you know
someone who could help us.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.969
If he needed help,

13:26.172 --> 13:29.106
He likely went here.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.075
Mention my name.

13:31.077 --> 13:35.246
And, if you must, bangkok.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.188
I last saw the jewels
in my dressing room.

13:44.224 --> 13:48.059
I'm sure they were stolen when
I went onstage for rehearsal.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.462
Miss federov, you certainly
don't need jewels to shine,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.531
Exceptionally
talented as you are.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.066
Ah!

13:55.068 --> 13:58.002
But I promise you this,
I will find them for you.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.837
Oh.
Thank you, inspector.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.174
You're very special.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.548
(milliner):
What is this about?

14:11.785 --> 14:14.218
Terence meyers gave
us your name.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.453
That name means nothing to me.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.056
We're looking for
information on this man.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.559
We believe him to be
a japanese secret agent.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.062
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.467
Bangkok.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.738
Fine.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.839
But tell meyers
this settles my debt.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.776
I don't know anything about
this man,

14:38.912 --> 14:40.444
All I do
is help people.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.315
I helped arrange his passage
and met him when he arrived,

14:44.317 --> 14:46.851
But I haven't seen
him for days.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.856
What task was he to carry out
while here in toronto?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.192
I believe he was sent
to kill someone.

14:58.865 --> 15:01.666
The necklace is gold
with many blue jewels.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.268
It glistens like the sea.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.870
(brackenreid):
You have quite the collection.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.477
I'd say this fits
the description, miss federov.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.812
Oh! Inspector!
Thank you!

15:15.916 --> 15:17.348
It was right there.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.083
Did you really think
it was stolen?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.953
Why, inspector,
what are you implying?

15:22.088 --> 15:24.422
I simply overlooked them
in my clumsiness.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.957
You're hardly clumsy,
miss federov.

15:26.993 --> 15:29.560
Few are as graceful as you.

15:29.629 --> 15:33.231
You know, inspector, I could
teach you a step or two.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.400
Partner ballet is
called pas-de-deux.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.103
The danseur provides
support for the ballerina

15:39.238 --> 15:41.639
And helps
maintain poise.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.375
Here, grab my waist

15:44.444 --> 15:46.076
As I start my pirouette.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.516
Uh, I have to go, miss federov.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.853
Inspector, wait.

15:58.024 --> 16:01.392
I'm planning an intimate
gathering in my hotel

16:01.428 --> 16:02.860
After my performance

16:02.896 --> 16:05.429
And I'd be delighted
if you could join.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.831
I'm...

16:06.966 --> 16:08.733
I'm not sure.
I would have to ask margaret.

16:08.868 --> 16:13.070
Ah, well, it's
very intimate party

16:13.206 --> 16:17.074
And I'm afraid there may not
be any room for anyone else.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.012
Thank you.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.319
So, which of them do
you think did it?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.887
None of them.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.823
Well, then what
are we doing here?

16:31.958 --> 16:33.357
We're making sure.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.559
But, higgins, I can't imagine
a family like the parks

16:35.628 --> 16:36.693
Have anything to hide.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.165
Sooner we arrest
one of them

16:41.167 --> 16:42.633
The sooner we can
go home to bed.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.168
Higgins, I'm telling you,
they're just a nice,

16:44.237 --> 16:45.837
Hard-working family.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.838
There's no way they had
anything to do with this.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.440
Wait, look.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.182
Oh, for pete's sake.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.351
You stay here in case one
of the others comes out.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.565
Sir, so there's a switchblade.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.236
Uh, various travel documents.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.239
Recent steamship passage.

17:55.275 --> 17:59.576
And then there's several visas
under several different names.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.514
Parks must have taken all of
this off of the body before

18:03.550 --> 18:05.382
Trying to bury it.

18:06.552 --> 18:07.918
A book.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.454
Looks like a novel.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.924
Odd thing for a spy
to be carrying.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.526
And then, sir, there's this.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.531
Some sort of palm print.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.401
That's unusual,

18:24.437 --> 18:26.737
Part of the ring
finger is missing.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.072
(crabtree):
What do you make of it, sir?

18:30.209 --> 18:32.509
That would be a question
for agent meyers.

18:33.679 --> 18:35.679
Take a look at this.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.882
The paper stock alone
is rather intriguing.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.653
Who is this?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.822
Detective llewellyn watts.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.524
Watts, terence meyers.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.493
Fine.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.899
Yeah, I've seen this
palm print before.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.233
Oh?

18:56.269 --> 18:57.968
It belongs to an jung-geun,

18:58.004 --> 19:00.505
Activist leader of
the korean resistance army.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.507
(crabtree):
An army?

19:02.642 --> 19:05.843
Group of koreans active
in vladivostok, russia.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.112
Their cause is freedom
from the japanese.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.780
And these koreans are in russia?

19:09.849 --> 19:12.783
Well, they would be
persecuted by the japanese

19:12.852 --> 19:13.985
In their own
country.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.455
Yes.

19:17.457 --> 19:21.058
According to the japanese,
an had eleven comrades.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.660
This, apparently,
is a list of those men.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.130
Why is part of his
finger missing?

19:26.265 --> 19:29.600
According to the japanese,
an cut off a piece of his finger

19:29.602 --> 19:31.735
And used his own blood
to write his manifesto.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.805
He signs all of his
documents with this...

19:35.842 --> 19:37.408
Palm print.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.944
And, then, less than a month
ago, an assassinated

19:40.013 --> 19:42.613
Former japanese prime minister
ito hirobumi

19:42.748 --> 19:45.283
On a train platform
in manchuria.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.819
An was captured by the russians
and handed over to the japanese.

19:48.821 --> 19:52.356
What happened to his
comrades I do not know.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.291
Could mr. Park, here in toronto,

19:54.327 --> 19:56.693
Be one of
the eleven comrades?

19:57.563 --> 19:58.696
I don't see why not.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.498
These are likely all
aliases, anyway.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.368
Ah, wait are we suggesting
that the japanese sent a spy

20:04.503 --> 20:05.770
To kill mr. Park

20:05.772 --> 20:08.239
Because he helped
orchestrate an assassination?

20:11.578 --> 20:14.778
Unexpected flash of insight,
constable crabtree.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.727
We believe one of the names on
this list is an alias of yours.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.930
You are one of the eleven men

20:33.967 --> 20:36.534
Who planned and executed
the assassination

20:36.669 --> 20:38.603
Of former
prime minister ito.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.103
Isn't that right?

20:42.575 --> 20:45.876
You knew the japanese would
seek out these eleven men.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.612
You hoped you would be safe
because you were only involved

20:48.615 --> 20:51.882
In the planning from afar,
but they found you.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.752
The japanese man in your cellar
was there to kill you,

20:54.821 --> 20:57.054
But you poisoned him
before he could.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.293
You then left him to die in
your basement,

21:02.295 --> 21:04.895
Tried to bury him,

21:04.964 --> 21:07.431
But your daughter panicked
and telephoned the police.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.233
And you hid
the dead man's belongings

21:09.235 --> 21:11.268
So they wouldn't be found
in your possession.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.974
Have you nothing to
say for yourself?

21:20.813 --> 21:22.846
Do with me what you must.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.021
Do you have any plans
for this evening?

21:31.024 --> 21:33.123
- No.
- Are you sure?

21:33.192 --> 21:35.559
'course I'm sure.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.228
What's that supposed to mean?

21:37.363 --> 21:38.795
I'm only curious.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.931
You were a little late coming
home for dinner last night.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.466
I got caught up at work.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.601
Well, I hope the same
doesn't happen tonight.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.269
I'm sure it won't.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.741
Oh, but having said that, bloody
meyers turned up yesterday,

21:50.743 --> 21:52.042
So you never know
what's in store.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.945
Best not wait for me
for dinner just in case.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.179
Toodle, pip.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.618
(sighs)

22:03.055 --> 22:06.290
Sir, do you really think
mr. Park is capable of murder?

22:06.292 --> 22:09.293
Well, if the murder was an act
of self-preservation, then yes.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.095
But, sir, I'm at their
store nearly every week.

22:12.131 --> 22:15.232
Do you mean to tell me that
while selling me an adze,

22:15.368 --> 22:18.502
This man was plotting some
international assassination?

22:18.538 --> 22:20.104
An adze?

22:20.106 --> 22:22.973
Well, yes, I was helping
mrs. Pratt in her garden.

22:22.975 --> 22:26.177
I don't believe this
belonged to the dead man.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.380
But mr. Park was hiding it
along with these other items

22:30.416 --> 22:32.716
That we know he removed
from the dead man.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.452
Indeed.
But this book is not japanese.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.054
These characters
are mostly chinese,

22:38.091 --> 22:40.491
Uh, but some
I can't identify.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.326
I suspect they may be korean.

22:42.395 --> 22:46.063
As I've been reading, koreans
write most official documents

22:46.132 --> 22:47.798
Using chinese characters.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.202
Their own alphabet has only
started to become in use

22:51.204 --> 22:54.405
Amongst academic
classes and the like.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.006
So this book is korean?

22:56.075 --> 22:57.774
It seems that way.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.943
Do you have any idea
what it says?

23:00.012 --> 23:03.080
The title is
freedom from bondage.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.484
I believe it is about
korean independence.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.886
Well, then perhaps
it belongs to mr. Park,

23:09.021 --> 23:11.689
A sort of guidebook
to the movement.

23:11.691 --> 23:12.756
Sir.

23:13.692 --> 23:14.691
Look at this.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.966
Looks like dozens of boxes.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.173
Micro photography.

23:29.175 --> 23:33.710
It's many, many documents
all on a single frame.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.248
Could we use your
projector to read it?

23:37.383 --> 23:38.682
Possibly.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.319
But we're going to
need a bigger lens.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.956
Sirs.
The park family is here.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.792
I'll take care of them.

23:53.399 --> 23:55.866
Constable. Please,
we'd like to visit our father.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.134
I don't think I can allow
that at the moment.

23:58.171 --> 23:59.269
Where is he?

23:59.305 --> 24:02.038
He's being held
in the cells for now.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.808
When will he be let out?

24:05.845 --> 24:07.110
I don't know, vincent.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.212
He's the suspect of this
murder investigation.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.748
He may be charged.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.285
Look, we believe that
he was involved

24:15.354 --> 24:17.822
In some sort of korean
independence movement.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.690
It can't be true.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.625
We would have known.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.828
My father is
a simple shop owner.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.161
He is a man of god.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.335
I believe they're
all in chinese.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.204
Given that it was
hidden inside the book,

24:34.273 --> 24:36.373
It likely belongs
to mr. Park.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.511
This one looks to be a schedule.
My guess is for a train.

24:43.850 --> 24:44.981
How can you tell?

24:45.017 --> 24:47.852
Well, these are times
and this one's circled.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.519
A particular train?

24:49.555 --> 24:52.656
But why would a train
schedule be top secret?

24:52.791 --> 24:55.625
Maybe it was about
who was on the train.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.562
Go down and to the right.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.366
Yes.
This is a date.

25:04.303 --> 25:08.238
And I've seen that
character before.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.176
I think.

25:14.514 --> 25:15.679
I think it means meeting.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.147
An itinerary, then.

25:20.085 --> 25:21.885
What was the date of
ito's assassination?

25:21.954 --> 25:24.021
- October 26th.
- This is it.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.090
The date and time he
was assassinated.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.093
This group of documents
is what was used to plan it.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.962
It was provided to
all the assassins,

25:31.998 --> 25:33.363
The eleven comrades.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.900
But ito is already dead.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.302
Why is this still of value?

25:39.572 --> 25:42.072
Perhaps simply to prove
that mr. Park was involved?

25:43.910 --> 25:46.142
Then why not destroy it?

25:47.313 --> 25:48.612
Good question.

25:51.317 --> 25:54.985
May be time to call your
surly friend with the cigar.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.591
Ah, sir?

26:00.593 --> 26:01.992
I found miss federov
wandering the station house.

26:02.127 --> 26:03.127
Inspector.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.128
Miss federov,
please do come in.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.998
Higgins, make yourself useful.
Go and put the kettle on.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.333
Sir, I --

26:12.271 --> 26:13.403
To what do
I owe the pleasure?

26:13.439 --> 26:15.672
I come with a gift.

26:15.741 --> 26:19.610
An apology for wasting your
time with my foolishness.

26:21.647 --> 26:24.415
Oh, this must have
cost a fortune.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.585
Oh, my family is very
well known in russia.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.553
Money?
We do not think about this.

26:31.256 --> 26:34.491
I hope you can accept this gift?

26:35.494 --> 26:37.027
I accept.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.730
Good.
I must go now.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.565
My performance begins soon.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.767
I hope to see you tonight.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.442
Think I need
a stiff drink of tea.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.245
So none of you have
seen this book before?

26:55.381 --> 26:56.780
No.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.515
Well, your father was
hiding it from us,

26:58.517 --> 27:00.183
And it was in your
home.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.618
So, either you've
seen it before,

27:01.621 --> 27:03.053
Or he was hiding it
from you, as well.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.389
This is a famous book in korea.

27:06.425 --> 27:09.125
It tells a story about
korean independence.

27:09.161 --> 27:12.329
It is seen with disapproval
in our country.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.265
What do you mean by disapproval?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.737
Would it have been popular
amongst the eleven comrades?

27:19.739 --> 27:20.804
Comrades?

27:20.873 --> 27:22.606
The men who assassinated ito.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.207
This is ridiculous.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.076
Would the author of this
book have been persecuted?

27:26.112 --> 27:28.011
Is this why your family
moved to toronto?

27:28.047 --> 27:29.212
Even if this was true,

27:29.248 --> 27:31.415
She had nothing to do
with the assassination!

27:32.885 --> 27:34.017
She?

27:41.227 --> 27:42.559
It is true.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.361
I am the author of this book.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.865
Then your husband had
nothing to do with this?

27:49.935 --> 27:51.501
He's the reason
we fled to canada.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.037
But you wrote the book.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.972
You're the one being persecuted.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.775
Our whole family was persecuted.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.513
I often wrote
about independence.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.381
I had gained a reputation.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.117
I wanted to stay, to fight.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.721
He wanted to leave
and I have to say,

28:10.723 --> 28:13.857
We are much more
at ease here.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.260
So, the man in the basement.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.197
He was seeking you.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.866
Yes.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.367
But I did not kill him.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.938
We found him there,
like we told you.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.740
It must have been an accident.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.076
Well, it was no accident,
mrs. Yoo.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.410
The man was poisoned.

28:36.348 --> 28:39.083
You are one of the eleven
comrades, aren't you?

28:39.218 --> 28:42.352
No. I swear,
we are hiding nothing from you.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.360
Sir?
What's going on?

28:50.362 --> 28:53.029
The film, someone's taken it.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.498
Was it stolen?

28:54.633 --> 28:56.099
Possibly.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.434
The thief has failed
in at least one respect.

28:58.471 --> 28:59.903
Of course, I've made a copy.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.641
Uh, sir, rachel and vincent
park are still here.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.310
They're hoping to have
a visit with the father.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.311
And, with their mother
now, I suppose.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.646
It had to have been one of them.

29:12.485 --> 29:14.718
I've finished translating
this document.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.053
And?

29:16.188 --> 29:19.523
It's a fascinating manifesto,
inspirational, really.

29:19.525 --> 29:22.793
These people are very
passionate about their country.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.495
We have other matters, watts.
Is there anything pertinent?

29:25.531 --> 29:28.531
As we can see,
an jung-geun cut off the tip

29:28.567 --> 29:29.666
Of his fourth
finger.

29:29.668 --> 29:32.936
But the manifesto explains

29:33.005 --> 29:35.272
All eleven comrades
did the same.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.741
Meaning neither mr. Park
nor mrs. Yoo

29:38.778 --> 29:40.143
Is one of
the eleven comrades.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.477
Meaning what?

29:41.514 --> 29:44.514
That this isn't about
the assassination after all?

29:45.184 --> 29:48.151
Or it's someone else.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.328
Mr. Park. I must ask you
to remove your gloves.

30:02.902 --> 30:03.767
Why?

30:03.769 --> 30:06.069
Take off your gloves,
mr. Park.

30:22.822 --> 30:25.154
I am a member of
the korean righteous army.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.292
You joined them
from here in canada.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.795
My family has been
here for some time.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.797
I arrived later.

30:34.834 --> 30:38.301
I was in vladivostok when
an jung-geun drew up the pact.

30:39.872 --> 30:42.272
I left when talk
of assassination started.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.474
So you wanted no part of it?

30:46.312 --> 30:48.078
I agree with their aims.

30:48.213 --> 30:49.680
I am my mother's son.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.616
But I do not agree with murder.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.754
The japanese sent
a man to kill you,

30:57.790 --> 31:00.290
But you killed him instead.

31:00.359 --> 31:04.361
I had no idea I had been found
until we discovered his body.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.831
You moved his body
in order to bury him.

31:07.966 --> 31:09.833
You were trying to cover it up.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.202
My father took control.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.639
He did not know the truth.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.707
He only knew it would
look bad for our family.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.044
He thought the police
would not believe us.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.715
Well, we might have if you'd
called us straight away.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.917
You're saying that
your father had no idea

31:27.953 --> 31:29.786
About your
involvement with an?

31:29.855 --> 31:31.054
No.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.355
Only my mother knew.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.926
He thought the man was here
for her, so he got rid

31:35.995 --> 31:38.128
Of everything that
might reveal this.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.395
The film?

31:39.431 --> 31:41.531
(crabtree):
Why keep it at all?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.734
I mean, if you had no part
in the assassination,

31:43.869 --> 31:44.935
Why keep the plans?

31:45.004 --> 31:46.903
I thought it might be valuable.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.608
I could trade this evidence for
my life if I were to be found.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.045
That's why you stole
it back from us?

31:56.882 --> 31:58.682
What are you talking about?

32:00.619 --> 32:02.385
I did no such thing.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.025
You called.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.160
Again?

32:10.229 --> 32:11.761
- (murdoch): Ah!
- What is it?

32:11.797 --> 32:15.699
Mr. Meyers, a lot has transpired
since I called for your help.

32:15.834 --> 32:18.702
I fear I may no longer need it.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.172
So, what, you wasted my time?

32:22.174 --> 32:25.608
Time spent with good people
is never time wasted.

32:26.946 --> 32:30.380
Since you're here,
this is why I called you.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.453
This film was hidden inside of
a book

32:36.588 --> 32:39.456
That was amongst the park
family's personal effects.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.324
The son, vincent,

32:41.393 --> 32:44.560
Has admitted to being one
of the eleven comrades.

32:45.698 --> 32:47.397
Let me just.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.536
Murdoch.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.138
Let this young man go.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.640
And destroy all records
of his arrest.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.409
Why?

33:00.545 --> 33:02.412
Need I say it, murdoch?

33:05.351 --> 33:06.950
National security.

33:07.019 --> 33:08.451
Exactly.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.631
You will not arrest us again?

33:21.667 --> 33:24.500
All I know for sure
is that you're free to go now.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.369
I'm so sorry about all of this.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.837
Thank you, constable.

33:27.873 --> 33:29.439
You have been very kind to us.

33:29.574 --> 33:30.573
You're very welcome,
mrs. Yoo.

33:32.745 --> 33:34.177
Tonight.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.579
We invite you to our home.

33:36.648 --> 33:40.650
We will serve the jjigae you
noticed on our dinner table.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.118
Do you accept?

33:42.154 --> 33:43.119
Yes, of course.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.154
What time should I come?

33:46.125 --> 33:47.190
Come now.

33:47.325 --> 33:49.626
Oh!
Excellent.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.928
I've hardly eaten
anything all day.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.597
(park):
You must be starving.

33:53.732 --> 33:57.267
I've released the parks and I
will burn all of the documents.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.404
So, what's this about?

34:02.274 --> 34:05.008
The contents of these
documents are clear,

34:05.143 --> 34:07.343
It's a plan
to assassinate ito.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.080
But it's not what they say.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.481
It's where it came from.

34:14.386 --> 34:17.621
This number indicates
the provenance.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.222
I've seen it before.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.492
This is a film stock used
exclusively

34:22.528 --> 34:24.026
By the russian
government.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.229
Meaning what?

34:27.232 --> 34:29.232
Meaning our
single biggest hope

34:29.268 --> 34:31.501
Is that we
eliminate any evidence

34:31.636 --> 34:35.572
Of this japanese agent's murder
and return to our normal lives.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.242
Are you saying the russians were
involved in this assassination?

34:40.479 --> 34:41.845
This at least proves

34:41.914 --> 34:44.380
They were involved
directly in its planning.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.051
At the risk of exposing
my ignorance,

34:48.186 --> 34:49.452
So what?

34:50.556 --> 34:51.988
Tensions have been high

34:52.124 --> 34:54.657
Ever since the end
of the russo-japanese war.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.593
If this were to get out, that
war would surely be reignited.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.329
But, this time, russia
wouldn't be fighting alone.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.534
Murdoch, do you recall
the triple entente

35:04.669 --> 35:07.403
You helped salvage here
in toronto some years ago?

35:07.439 --> 35:10.140
The alliance between russia,
britain and France.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.276
Mm-hm. And, by extension,
the entire british empire,

35:13.411 --> 35:14.710
Including canada.

35:16.048 --> 35:18.815
The release of this document
could drag canada into a war?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.483
Oh, not just canada.

35:20.552 --> 35:24.086
Alliances upon alliances would
drag dozens of countries

35:24.123 --> 35:26.022
From around the world
into the greatest war

35:26.091 --> 35:27.657
This world
has ever known.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.094
A first truly world war.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.104
Are you telling us the fate of
the world

35:42.141 --> 35:44.841
Is hanging in the balance
of our investigation?

35:46.311 --> 35:48.411
It wouldn't be the first time.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.684
Who killed the japanese
agent, then?

35:56.989 --> 35:58.388
That clearly doesn't matter.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.659
What does matter is that

36:02.728 --> 36:04.594
None of this ever happened.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.548
I cannot stay silent
a moment longer.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.683
- When have you ever stayed--
- I saw you with her!

36:27.719 --> 36:29.219
- Who?
- Oh, don't play dumb with me.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.854
- The ballerina.
- Margaret!

36:30.856 --> 36:32.455
And then you lied about it!

36:32.457 --> 36:33.556
I did no such thing.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.091
You pretended that
it didn't happen.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.425
Nothing did happen.

36:36.461 --> 36:38.894
She came into the station house
because she'd lost some jewelry.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.563
I helped her find it.
That's all.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.232
Really?

36:42.301 --> 36:43.633
On my honour.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.702
Oh.

36:48.073 --> 36:49.372
What's this?

36:50.943 --> 36:52.042
She gave it to me.

36:52.044 --> 36:53.509
Why?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.045
For helping her.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.513
And because.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.449
Look, margaret, I swear,
I turned her down.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.284
She invited me to
her hotel room tonight

37:01.353 --> 37:02.385
And I've turned
her down.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.788
That hussy!

37:04.923 --> 37:06.089
Margaret, no!

37:07.259 --> 37:08.858
You better have
turned her down,

37:08.860 --> 37:10.593
Thomas charles
brackenreid.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.528
And you'd better be
home for dinner.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.410
The bloody hell is this?

37:32.017 --> 37:33.817
It's a surveillance device.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.485
It records and transmits
auditory information.

37:36.521 --> 37:38.088
You mean it was listening to me.

37:38.223 --> 37:39.556
Indeed.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.090
Why would anyone want
to listen to me?

37:41.126 --> 37:43.560
Perhaps it has to
do with a case?

37:43.695 --> 37:46.729
A case? She's a bloody
russian ballerina.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.499
Russian?

37:50.969 --> 37:53.135
Do you think she's connected
to the stolen film?

37:53.972 --> 37:56.105
An awfully big coincidence.

37:56.141 --> 37:58.641
Uh, inspector, was your
ballerina friend here

37:58.644 --> 38:01.377
About two
hours ago?

38:02.281 --> 38:03.779
That's when she
gave me the box.

38:04.516 --> 38:05.782
Then it's her.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.616
What's all this about, then?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.986
That woman is a russian spy.

38:11.023 --> 38:14.257
She was sent here to eliminate
any trace of russian involvement

38:14.392 --> 38:15.325
In the assassination.

38:15.327 --> 38:18.261
Which means there
might be a loose end.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.463
- Vincent park.
- Not just him.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.666
If he knows,
his whole family knows.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.101
That means...

38:25.971 --> 38:27.470
She's going to kill them all.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.606
Sir, find the park family,
get them somewhere safe.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.875
Agent meyers and I will
arrest the ballerina.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.344
Watts, you stay here,

38:34.479 --> 38:36.412
Gather some constables
in case we need help.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.556
- Klavdia federov?
- Who are you?

38:46.691 --> 38:48.558
Klavdia federov,
you are under arrest.

38:48.693 --> 38:51.227
You are being detained
by the government of canada.

38:51.296 --> 38:52.362
I am not klavdia federov.

38:52.364 --> 38:53.830
You're not?

38:53.832 --> 38:55.832
I am klavdia's understudy.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.434
Well, then where is she?

38:58.270 --> 39:00.035
She said she was ill.

39:01.873 --> 39:02.839
Oh, no.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.640
Oh, no!

39:10.115 --> 39:12.315
Stay away from my husband!

39:12.450 --> 39:14.784
I'm sorry.
I do not understand.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.187
Come, let us talk.

39:17.322 --> 39:19.989
I really don't think we have
anything to talk about!

39:19.991 --> 39:22.125
(screams and groans)

39:23.128 --> 39:25.795
Shh!
Move and you die, understand?

39:25.930 --> 39:26.863
Yes.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.633
(crabtree):
Wait here a moment.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.606
Miss, what's going on?

39:36.741 --> 39:37.941
Is everything all right?

39:38.076 --> 39:40.376
(pained grunts)

39:42.013 --> 39:43.480
(brackenreid):
Stop right there!

39:43.482 --> 39:44.347
(grunting efforts)

39:44.482 --> 39:45.815
(crabtree):
Get inside!

39:46.551 --> 39:48.617
Get inside!

39:51.890 --> 39:53.423
You bloody used me!

39:53.425 --> 39:54.924
Sorry, inspector.

39:57.362 --> 39:58.561
Stay there!

40:03.435 --> 40:04.834
What a woman.

40:08.106 --> 40:09.572
I love you.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.707
I love
you.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.578
Oh, my goodness.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.587
(meyers): The way I see it,
you have two choices.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.323
Confess and I'll hand
you back to the russians.

40:27.392 --> 40:30.193
Stay quiet and I'll throw
you to the japanese.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.428
Take your choice.
Both will kill me.

40:33.732 --> 40:36.332
The russians?
You're one of theirs.

40:36.334 --> 40:38.601
What I did with
this assassination,

40:38.736 --> 40:41.003
This was not
a sanctioned action.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.807
- You're a rogue agent?
- Indeed.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.944
Three of us, working
with the koreans.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.146
We hated that russia
surrendered to japan.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.483
We never forgave
and so we fight.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.486
Then you did it all.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.821
It was you who poisoned
the japanese agent.

40:58.824 --> 41:02.791
I had to kill him before
he got to the microfilm.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.695
You're the one who stole
the film from my office.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.765
And if you'd succeeded
in killing the parks,

41:08.900 --> 41:11.234
Your secret
would have been kept.

41:11.303 --> 41:12.502
And it'll stay that way.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.405
It behooves no one to implicate
russia in any of this,

41:17.709 --> 41:19.108
Including canada.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.777
Then what will happen to me?

41:23.581 --> 41:24.981
Assuming you're
telling the truth,

41:25.116 --> 41:27.584
I'll pretend that your identity
was discovered incidentally

41:27.719 --> 41:29.485
And I'll trade you back to
the russians without revealing

41:29.488 --> 41:30.753
Any of the real story.

41:34.392 --> 41:36.860
Thank you, murdoch. I think we
can consider this matter closed.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.529
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to get back to project iguana.

41:40.565 --> 41:43.933
Ah, yes.
What is project iguana?

41:46.605 --> 41:48.204
It is a painting.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.939
Laurier ordered it for his wife.

41:50.074 --> 41:51.607
Oh.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.675
What's in it?

41:52.810 --> 41:54.877
Has someone made an
attempt on his life?

41:55.614 --> 41:57.547
What?
No, no, no, no.

41:57.549 --> 42:00.350
It's got lost in the mail.
The man's incensed about it.

42:00.485 --> 42:02.218
My job now to try to find it.

42:11.496 --> 42:12.628
Mmm.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.833
This is marvelous.
What is it?

42:16.968 --> 42:19.568
This is doenjang-jjigae.

42:19.604 --> 42:20.903
Soybean stew.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.107
Oh, it's the best stew
I've ever come across.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.508
You'll have to
give me the recipe.

42:25.510 --> 42:27.710
- I'm a bit of a cook myself.
- Oh?

42:27.779 --> 42:30.580
This is a family recipe,
so I don't think my mother

42:30.649 --> 42:31.714
Will share it with you.

42:31.849 --> 42:34.049
But I'm glad you
like it, constable.

42:34.085 --> 42:37.320
If you really
like it that much,

42:37.322 --> 42:39.055
Perhaps we
should sell it.

42:39.057 --> 42:42.858
Abeoji, I don't think people
will buy food

42:42.928 --> 42:44.260
From a hardware store.

42:44.329 --> 42:48.865
Why not? Customers shop,
they get hungry.

42:48.867 --> 42:53.135
Ah! Uh, come for an adze.
Stay for the stew!

42:53.171 --> 42:57.073
Or we open a restaurant.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.008
A korean restaurant?

42:59.143 --> 43:01.010
Who will come to eat?

43:01.012 --> 43:03.545
We're the only
koreans in toronto.

43:03.582 --> 43:06.148
Ah, maybe, one day,

43:06.184 --> 43:08.417
There will be a whole
neighbourhood

43:08.453 --> 43:11.821
Filled with korean shops
and restaurants.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.289
A whole neighbourhood.

43:13.358 --> 43:16.158
Uh, like chinatown,
but with koreans!

43:16.227 --> 43:17.760
You could call it...

43:17.762 --> 43:19.162
Koreatown!

43:19.297 --> 43:20.529
Excellent.

43:20.565 --> 43:22.965
I guess there could be
korean clothing stores

43:23.034 --> 43:24.367
And grocery stores.

43:24.369 --> 43:29.172
And one store with all
manner of convenient items.

43:29.307 --> 43:30.773
A convenient store!

43:32.110 --> 43:34.043
You two are out of your minds.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.078
