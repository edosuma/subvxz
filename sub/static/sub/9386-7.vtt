WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:05.005
[Singing] It seems today that all you see

00:05.088 --> 00:08.300
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.383 --> 00:11.887
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.970 --> 00:14.515
On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:18.268
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.352 --> 00:21.688
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.772 --> 00:23.690
All the things that make us

00:23.774 --> 00:25.067
Laugh and cry

00:25.150 --> 00:29.655
He's a family guy

00:34.368 --> 00:35.744
[People laughing]

00:35.827 --> 00:38.997
This is ridiculous.
Why did y'all drag me here?

00:39.081 --> 00:42.000
Because you can't just
sit home every night since Loretta left.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.836
You got to get out and meet some women.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.255
Well, I suppose I could give it a try.

00:46.797 --> 00:50.509
Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black
and then have to make...

00:50.592 --> 00:54.012
a difficult decision regarding
whether or not to go back?

00:54.096 --> 00:57.099
Sorry, I went burnt sienna
and I never went back.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.393
Ready, baby? Who's this clown?

01:03.856 --> 01:08.068
Open up, Stewie.
The airplane's coming in for a landing.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.905
I guess the pilot must have been
JFK Junior.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.575
Even I found that to be in bad taste.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.243
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.705
Good morning, Chris. Oh, my God!
Look at the size of that pimple.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.874
You're like a circus freak!

01:22.374 --> 01:24.877
I'm kidding.
You're just becoming a man, sweetie.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.004
Yeah. I remember when I became a man.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.883
The operation was a success.
What are you gonna go by now?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.259
Peter.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.970
You know, Chris, we'll have to
do something about that.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.972
But I don't wanna get rid of my zit.

01:37.055 --> 01:40.309
I like him. He's my friend.
His name is Doug.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.144
I just wish I didn't have to look at it.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.563
We have to look at your anus all day.

01:44.646 --> 01:45.898
Thank you.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.320
The Bachelorette comes to Quahog
in search of male contestants.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.905
Story at 11:00.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.282
Well, actually, that was pretty much it.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.909
But there will be other stuff, too.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.702
Look, I'm turning down the thermostat.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.495
See Diane's erect nipples at 11:00.

02:00.579 --> 02:03.332
Oh, my God!
The Bachelorette is coming to Quahog.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.209
That's, like, my favorite show ever.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.835
Meg, how can you watch that crap?

02:06.919 --> 02:08.795
That show is not reality. It's all staged.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.131
It's a complete mockery
of human relationships.

02:11.215 --> 02:14.343
You know, this could be the perfect way
for Cleveland to meet Mrs. Right.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.845
I got to tell him. Hey, Cleveland.

02:17.012 --> 02:21.016
Joe? Sorry, I dialed the wrong number.
I meant to call Cleveland.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.310
No, I just wanted to tell him something.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.104
No, I'd like to talk to you, too.
It's just that--

02:26.188 --> 02:28.941
Fine. I'll call you after
I talk to Cleveland.

02:29.024 --> 02:31.443
I don't feel obligated. I want to.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.947
You're a good pimple, Doug.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.365
Feed me.

02:36.949 --> 02:38.700
You can talk?

02:38.784 --> 02:41.245
That's right.
And we're gonna raise some hell.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.455
All right! Raise some hell!

03:09.690 --> 03:12.526
So, why would you be a good candidate
on The Bachelorette?

03:12.609 --> 03:14.736
I would be perfect for your show...

03:14.820 --> 03:18.156
because I know
how to talk dirty to the ladies.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.536
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. That feels so good.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.663
Spit in my mouth.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.625
Two hundred auditions and nothing.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.127
We still got one guy waiting.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.213
You lined up 201 auditions?
What a weird number.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.298
You're weird.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.968
Peter, I can't do this.
I am too nervous. I got to go.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.095
No, Cleveland,
I'm not gonna let you do this.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.722
I'll tie you down, if I have to.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.100
Peter, this is only making it worse.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.853
Oh, God, my claustrophobia is setting in.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.105
It's all right. It's okay.
It's the fabric.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.691
It's your clothes.
Let's get your clothes off.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.611
Peter, what's wrong with you? I am naked!

03:55.694 --> 03:57.863
Oh, God, you're self-conscious. I'm sorry.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.781
Here. You know what?
Look, Cleveland, look.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.617
See? Now you're not alone, Cleveland.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.745
Let me out of here!
I need to get out of here.

04:04.828 --> 04:08.749
Cleveland, no, you're staying.
This is for your own good.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.542
Oh, my God!

04:12.753 --> 04:14.796
Hi, we're here for the interview.

04:16.924 --> 04:20.469
Excuse me. Hi. Listen, I just wanted
to apologize for Peter.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.804
He was just trying to help out his friend.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.641
You see, his wife left him
and he's been kind of lonely...

04:25.724 --> 04:27.559
confused about what he really wants.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.144
-What's your name?
-Brian.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.981
Congratulations, Brian.
You're gonna be on The Bachelorette.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.026
Really? You're sure
you don't want to reconsider my friend?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.819
Let me see.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.322
Oh, that ain't bad!

04:45.202 --> 04:48.372
Brian, I can't believe
you're gonna be on The Bachelorette.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.499
Yeah, I thought you said
those shows were stupid.

04:50.582 --> 04:51.583
They are stupid.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.169
But I figured I got a few days
of free booze and food...

04:54.253 --> 04:56.213
before they kick me off.
I could use a vacation.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.008
Oh, yeah, because you've got
such a heavy workload around here.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.680
How you coming on that novel
you're working on, huh?

05:05.013 --> 05:07.724
Got a big stack of papers there?

05:08.475 --> 05:11.854
Got a nice little story
you working on there?

05:11.937 --> 05:15.274
The big novel you've been working on
for three years, huh?

05:16.108 --> 05:18.527
Got a compelling protagonist?

05:18.610 --> 05:21.154
Got an obstacle for him to overcome?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.616
Little story brewing there? Working on?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.494
Working on that for quite some time, huh?

05:27.578 --> 05:31.665
Talking about that three years ago.
Been working on that the whole time?

05:31.748 --> 05:34.793
Nice little narrative.
Beginning, middle, and end.

05:34.877 --> 05:38.130
Some friends become enemies,
some enemies become friends?

05:38.213 --> 05:41.967
At the end your main character
is richer for the experience? Yeah?

05:43.385 --> 05:45.637
No, you deserve some time off.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.725
I am super excited.
You think she'll be hot?

05:49.808 --> 05:52.019
-I bet she'll be hot.
-I think she'll be hot, too.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.687
No way! So do I!

05:56.481 --> 05:58.442
-Quagmire.
-Hey, Brian!

05:58.525 --> 06:01.528
-How did you get on the show?
-I had to do a few favors.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.072
I got to get on that show.
Come on, I'll do anything.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.407
Anything?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.493
-Yeah.
-All right.

06:09.661 --> 06:10.913
-Okay, you're ready?
-Yep.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.789
Okay, check under the bed.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.250
-No, nothing.
-Check in the closet.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.085
No, no monsters in here.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.587
Now check the bathroom.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.589
-No, none in here, either.
-Okay, good.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.509
-So, can I be on The Bachelorette?
-Yeah. Goodnight.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.514
Peter, I'm getting
a little worried about Chris.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.683
All he does lately is sit alone
in his room talking to that zit.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.560
Relax, Lois. What's a zit gonna do?

06:33.644 --> 06:36.855
Talk to him and tell him to
sneak out of the house and cause trouble?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.777
Now light it, ring the doorbell,
and run like hell!

06:41.860 --> 06:44.488
-I don't know about this, Doug.
-Just do it!

06:47.908 --> 06:49.201
Oh, good Lord!

06:53.664 --> 06:55.916
Is that... Doody!

06:55.999 --> 06:59.336
I'm doing the dishes, Joe.
I'll change you in a minute.

07:03.799 --> 07:06.802
Trevor, this is Brooke, the bachelorette.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.887
I wasn't too nervous.
When I am nervous I work out.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.057
I wasn't working out,
so I must not have been nervous.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.851
I was very pleased and surprised.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.521
I really was not expecting an open bar.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.606
Top-shelf booze, I tell you.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.693
And this guy knew his stuff.
Made me a Mojito.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.406
I don't think it's a gay drink.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.575
Mojito!

07:31.493 --> 07:34.288
Hey, guys.
Well, it's been great to meet you all.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.416
And I am looking forward
to getting to know you while we're here.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.671
-Dude, put your pants on.
-Shut up.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.464
Well, I really like all the guys.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.176
But some of them
seem a little too competitive.

07:48.302 --> 07:52.097
I got to tell you. I don't know what she
would possibly see in Count Chocula.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.266
I think he's just here
because he's a minority.

08:06.612 --> 08:09.740
You were right, Doug. Mischief is fun.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.743
We're the best pals since the Snorks.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.037
I am having a really great time.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.123
Me, too. I really value our friendship.

08:18.207 --> 08:21.627
You're not like those other Snorks
who only want one thing.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.630
Oh, that was clumsy. Hang on a second.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.099
Gentlemen, it's time
for the first rose ceremony.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.061
Who gets to stay,
and who takes the bus ride home...

08:39.144 --> 08:40.562
it's up to Brooke.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.441
-Trevor.
-That's what Trevor's talking about.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.777
Hey, can I say hi to a friend of mine?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.820
-Sure.
-Hi, Jesus!

08:49.071 --> 08:50.239
No way!

08:50.322 --> 08:51.365
[Phone ringing]

08:51.448 --> 08:53.492
Hello. I know. I saw.

08:53.659 --> 08:54.785
Glenn.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.667
-Brian.
-What? Are you serious?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.710
I feel like I didn't get
to know you at all.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.921
-Would you accept this rose?
-All right.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.299
But I think this whole thing is about
as pointless as Peter's cow-kite.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.933
This is never gonna work. Damn cow.
Cleveland, what am I doing wrong?

09:18.016 --> 09:21.645
You got to get her running
before you start running.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.774
Chris.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.443
Chris, honey, can I talk to you?

09:31.655 --> 09:33.699
Oh, my God, he's gone!

09:33.782 --> 09:35.534
That means this room is mine now.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.619
I am gonna party my ass off in here.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.454
Great pot, Stewie.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.748
Yeah, I got it from
our cleaning lady's boyfriend.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.835
It's okay, though, 'cause she's gonna
use the money to get a mammogram.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.255
Chris, where have you been?

09:48.338 --> 09:50.841
Doug told me I don't need
to listen to you.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.594
Doug? Your pimple? Oh, that is it!

09:53.677 --> 09:56.513
First thing tomorrow, we're going down
to Goldman's Pharmacy...

09:56.597 --> 09:58.765
and get some astringent
to get rid of that thing.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.226
What did I tell you?
She's trying to drive us apart.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.728
We can't let that happen.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.064
I am in no mood.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.613
Welcome to the Saddleback Ranch
and our first group date.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.865
Is everyone ready
for a little cowboy action?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.784
-Yeah!
-I love horses.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.078
Sorry, I am late, Brian. Here's your ride.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.414
Oh, come on, you can't expect me
to ride that thing.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.333
Sorry, we're short on horses.

10:25.209 --> 10:28.128
You know what? Forget it.
I'll just go smoke.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.881
-Hey, there, Adam.
-Hello, Henry.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.926
I have the power!

10:45.103 --> 10:46.396
Brooke, what are you doing here?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.357
Oh, I just can't take it anymore.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.859
All these guys just coming on to me.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.904
I had to sneak off.
Oh, could I bum one of those?

10:55.030 --> 10:57.824
You know, I don't even know
why I agreed to do this show.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.159
This is just so not me.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.663
I'd much rather just be home
listening to my old jazz records.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.666
Really? I didn't know. I actually have
quite a jazz collection myself.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.293
-What do you like?
-DJ Jazzy Jeff!

11:09.127 --> 11:10.629
I'm kidding!

11:11.797 --> 11:14.049
Oh, you got me. Oh, you got me, yeah.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.636
No, I really like Coleman Hawkins,
Ben Webster.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.597
Oh, and early Coltrane,
before he got clean.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.558
Yeah, no junk, no soul.

11:22.641 --> 11:25.060
No kidding. I mean, look at Chevy Chase.

11:25.644 --> 11:26.895
Right.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.773
You know, I got to say, I thought
she was just some actress...

11:29.857 --> 11:34.069
looking for her 15 minutes of fame,
but she's pretty sharp, you know.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.030
I guess you can't judge
a Brooke by her cover.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.409
You can cut that out, right?

11:40.492 --> 11:45.247
And maybe you can cut out when I said
junk earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.750
Seems like he's probably
the kind of guy who might sue.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.003
I mean, the guy's got to have
no money left.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.089
All right, gentlemen...

11:54.173 --> 11:57.176
let's see how Glenn's
private date with Brooke is going.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.596
Hey, Brooke, what do you say,
we get you some more champagne?

12:00.679 --> 12:01.930
Sure.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.897
All right.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.068
Hey, forgot about you guys.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.196
Well, I guess the date's over.

12:17.279 --> 12:20.199
Goodnight, Brooke.
Thanks for a lovely evening.

12:22.201 --> 12:23.577
[Glenn sniffing]

12:24.411 --> 12:26.038
[Glenn exclaiming in delight]

12:27.873 --> 12:30.542
Oh, my God, Peter,
it looks like there's been a break in.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.378
Do you think so?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.423
Oh, God, they're back.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.054
Whoa, awesome! Totally awesome!

12:43.347 --> 12:44.973
All right, Goldman.

12:45.057 --> 12:46.850
What the hell is your problem, Mort?

12:46.934 --> 12:49.978
I am sorry, Peter. I thought you were
one of those criminals...

12:50.062 --> 12:53.899
who broke in and destroyed
my entire stock of acne medication.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.818
Oh, my God. Peter, do you think
Chris might have done this?

12:56.902 --> 13:00.239
Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild
streak you had when you were younger.

13:00.322 --> 13:03.909
For God's sake, you used to make
Plasto molds of celebrity body parts.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.913
Okay, Daryl, it's almost dry.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.665
Very nice, by the way.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.459
This one's going on the shelf
right next to Dan Fogelberg.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.169
Hey, Lois, am I up next?

13:14.253 --> 13:17.840
Just wait in your dressing room.
I'll come back for you, Oates.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.925
I am not coming back for Oates.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.054
Glenn, will you accept this rose?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.347
Really? After I drugged you...

13:25.430 --> 13:27.558
and tried to have sex
with your unconscious body?

13:27.641 --> 13:28.642
-What?
-Yes.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.144
This is the final rose tonight.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.691
-Brian.
-Yes!

13:35.774 --> 13:38.068
Yeah, I mean,
I know I was skeptical at first...

13:38.151 --> 13:42.072
but I got to be honest, I've never
felt this way about anyone before.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.367
I mean, I am in love. That's it.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.452
I am in love.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.956
I finally understand
those songs on the radio.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.293
[Singing] What did you think

13:55.169 --> 13:58.505
I would do at this moment

13:59.089 --> 14:02.467
When you're standing before me

14:02.634 --> 14:05.554
With tears in your eyes

14:09.474 --> 14:12.769
Brooke has narrowed her choice down
to Quagmire and Brian.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.689
All that's left is for Brooke
to meet their families.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.406
Hey, Brian, I can't wait
to meet your family.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.825
Yeah, me, too. They're pretty great.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.786
Brian, welcome home, you son of a bitch!

14:29.870 --> 14:32.331
So, did you loose?
You got to tell me all about it.

14:32.414 --> 14:34.333
Hey, how was your bachelorette?

14:34.416 --> 14:37.044
Was she a dumb bimbo like you said
but with a big rack.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.754
Come on in and tell me everything.

14:38.837 --> 14:42.591
I bet your stories will make me laugh
so hard, I'll shoot milk out of my nose.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.635
Peter, this is Brooke, the bachelorette.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.470
She's having dinner with us tonight.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.473
I went over this with you
a few minutes ago.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.479
Why, it's wonderful to meet you.
We've heard so many nice things.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.357
Yes, indeed.
So, how long have you been a prostitute?

14:58.440 --> 15:01.193
No, Doug, I will not lift up her shirt.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.945
Chris, we have company.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.531
So, you ever been with a woman?

15:05.864 --> 15:06.990
No.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.450
-Peter!
-What?

15:09.034 --> 15:11.286
There. Are you happy, Doug?

15:12.162 --> 15:14.998
Christopher Cross Griffin,
what are you doing?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.959
Joe, what are you doing here?

15:17.042 --> 15:21.630
Peter, we have proof that it was Chris
who vandalized Goldman's Pharmacy.

15:21.713 --> 15:25.926
I knew it. I didn't want
to believe it, but it's true.

15:26.009 --> 15:29.179
Oh, God, what happened to my baby.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.681
Who sold you the drugs?

15:30.764 --> 15:32.349
I can't believe this!

15:33.225 --> 15:34.560
[All arguing]

15:42.401 --> 15:44.945
...what a cavity search is.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.575
You made my mom cry tonight, Doug.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.952
I don't think you're a very good friend.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.162
I am not gonna listen to you anymore.

15:54.246 --> 15:57.165
Oh, yeah? I'm inside your head now, fatty.

15:57.249 --> 16:00.043
And I just might reach into your brain
and do this.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.629
Okay, I'll listen.

16:02.754 --> 16:03.839
[Laughing]

16:03.922 --> 16:05.132
That's my boy.

16:05.215 --> 16:08.343
Now, grab my bacon grease
and slather me up some homeys.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.140
-What's going on, man?
-Wassup, dog.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.350
Yeah, where are all the whiteheads at?

16:19.146 --> 16:23.192
Brian, we've had some wonderful times.
I really like you.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.569
Look, I understand. It's okay.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.488
I hope you and Quagmire
have all the happiness in the world.

16:28.572 --> 16:29.740
But I am choosing you.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.284
Just promise me
you'll make him wear this...What?

16:32.367 --> 16:35.787
You're choosing me?
After what happened with my family?

16:35.871 --> 16:39.416
Well, it wasn't as bad as the evening
I spent with Glenn and his mother.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.837
Glenn, would you feed Mittens?

16:43.921 --> 16:45.339
Mittens has food in his bowl.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.257
That's old food!

16:47.341 --> 16:49.301
Mittens, shut up!

16:49.384 --> 16:52.846
Don't you talk to Mittens that way.
Mittens is a member of this family.

16:52.930 --> 16:56.475
Mom, you want this three-way to happen,
you're gonna have to change your tone.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.103
My God, you've just made me
the happiest dog in the world.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.106
-I love you, Brooke.
-I love you, too, Brian.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.364
All right, that's a wrap.

17:11.281 --> 17:14.117
Well, it was great working with you,
Brian. Good luck.

17:14.326 --> 17:17.621
What are you talking about?
What about us?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.873
Oh, stop it. It's just TV.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.962
-Hi, Brian.
-Michael Eisner?

17:25.045 --> 17:28.090
On behalf of ABC,
I'd like to give you this parting gift.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.424
A bill for the mansion.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.468
No givesies-backsies!

17:37.307 --> 17:39.768
Hey, Brooke, it's me again, Brian.

17:39.977 --> 17:43.647
Hi. Wasn't sure
if you got my last message...

17:44.106 --> 17:47.818
or any of the other ones.
Anyway, I'll just leave a quick message...

17:47.901 --> 17:50.112
'cause you might be trying
to call me right now.

17:50.195 --> 17:53.490
And I don't want to tie up the line.
So, I guess...

17:53.574 --> 17:56.118
I guess... Yeah, give me a call.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.871
Okay, I'm hanging up...

17:58.954 --> 18:02.249
in three, two, one.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.209
Okay, call me back.

18:04.293 --> 18:07.838
I'll be here all day, and tonight.

18:08.172 --> 18:09.548
Okay, bye.

18:12.801 --> 18:16.430
Hey, me again. Thought I might've
heard a voice when I was hanging up.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.600
Nope? I guess not.
Okay, I will talk to you soon.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.476
Hello? No. Sorry.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.981
Hey, babe. Just trying you again.

18:26.064 --> 18:30.110
Listening to our guy Coltrane,
you know. Okay.

18:30.194 --> 18:34.156
Anyway, I got a fax earlier
about cheap airfare to Cancún.

18:34.239 --> 18:37.326
Didn't know if that was you
trying to reach me.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.579
Let me give you my home number again
just in case you lost it.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.873
-Voicemail is full.
-Damn.

18:42.956 --> 18:43.957
[Doorbell ringing]

18:44.958 --> 18:48.086
-Package for Brooke Roberts.
-Oh, that's me. Thanks.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.590
BRIAN: Hey, there. Me again.

18:51.673 --> 18:55.427
Your voicemail was full,
so I got you this answering machine.

18:55.511 --> 18:58.639
So, what's going on?

18:58.722 --> 19:01.475
I was thinking about
doing something tonight--

19:01.558 --> 19:02.768
Hey, you're home.

19:03.769 --> 19:08.106
Listen, Brian, I want you to leave me
alone, or I'm calling the cops.

19:09.233 --> 19:13.362
[Singing] Brooke, I'm so in love with you

19:22.996 --> 19:24.540
Chris, where the hell are we?

19:24.623 --> 19:27.918
I told you, Doug,
this is the bacon factory.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.629
Doctor, I need you to get rid of this zit.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.340
-You traitor!
-That's a doozy.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.134
I bet some of those awful kids at school
call you zit-face.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.386
-No.
-Pop-a-zit.

19:37.469 --> 19:38.512
-No.
-Puspeak.

19:38.595 --> 19:39.721
-No.
-Fat ass?

19:39.805 --> 19:41.348
-Yeah.
-That's terrible.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.517
We're gonna have to use
some cortisone on that.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.019
Oh, yeah? Two can play at that game.

19:47.563 --> 19:49.356
Don't think I won't do it, man.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.859
All right, let's all be cool here.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.328
No!

20:05.956 --> 20:07.165
You okay, fat ass?

20:09.835 --> 20:14.047
She told me she loved me
on what used to be a hit TV show.

20:14.131 --> 20:17.259
I can't believe I got sucked into
that phony reality world...

20:17.342 --> 20:20.596
just like everyone else.
I became the very thing I was mocking.

20:20.679 --> 20:23.557
I know it hurts now, Brian,
but look at the bright side.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.727
You have some new material
for that novel you've been writing.

20:26.810 --> 20:29.646
You know, the novel
you've been working on.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.650
You know, the one
you've been working on for three years.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.694
You know, the novel.

20:36.236 --> 20:39.072
You got something new
to write about now, you know.

20:39.156 --> 20:43.118
Maybe a main character
gets into a relationship...

20:43.785 --> 20:46.205
then suffers a little heartbreak.

20:46.288 --> 20:49.541
Something like
what you've just been through.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.002
Draw from a real-life experience.

20:52.669 --> 20:56.340
Little heartbreak, you know,
work it into the story.

20:56.965 --> 21:00.385
Make those characters
a little more three-dimensional.

21:00.469 --> 21:03.347
A little richer experience for the reader.

21:03.514 --> 21:05.891
Make those second hundred pages...

21:05.974 --> 21:08.644
really keep the reader guessing
what's going to happen.

21:08.727 --> 21:11.355
Some twists and turns. Little epilogue.

21:12.147 --> 21:14.983
Everybody learns the hero's journey
isn't always a happy one.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.818
Yeah, I look forward to reading it.
