00:14.000 --> 00:16.160
Kids, life is a dark road.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.080
You never really know what's up ahead.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.720
One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride,

00:20.720 --> 00:22.360
and then all of a sudden,

00:23.120 --> 00:24.440
you're 28.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.640
And for the birthday boy, lasagna.

00:26.640 --> 00:27.560
Thank you.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.600
Careful. The plate is very hot.

00:29.600 --> 00:30.680
'Kay.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.320
Oh, go on, touch it.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.800
Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.000
All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.280
Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.400
I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.560
You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing

00:45.560 --> 00:47.920
and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck...

00:47.920 --> 00:50.160
in addition to probably being kind of healthy.

00:50.760 --> 00:54.720
Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time.

00:54.760 --> 00:55.840
Barney.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.200
Oy, gevalt.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.920
- Ah... Happy birthday, Ted. 
- Whoo-hoo!

01:03.920 --> 01:05.920
Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y...

01:05.960 --> 01:07.160
Oh, my God.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.240
What?

01:08.280 --> 01:10.080
Oh! Call an ambulance!

01:10.120 --> 01:11.800
- What's going on?
- Try not to speak.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.920
Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.280
- Is she okay?
- I'm serious, call 911.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.520
What's wrong? What's the matter?

01:17.520 --> 01:20.240
Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try...

01:20.280 --> 01:22.320
Here, have some water. Water!

01:23.160 --> 01:24.400
Here, drink this.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.040
Shh! Shh!

01:26.520 --> 01:29.000
You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am

01:29.040 --> 01:31.240
that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.960
Wait for it.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.960
28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.000
Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.200
Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.800
But I'll get to that later.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.720
Still, you know, another year older. Still single.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.320
You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?

01:51.360 --> 01:54.080
Nope. I hit the snooze button.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.160
And here come the paramedics.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.840
Oh, thank God, you're here.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.000
What is going on?!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.520
I think there might be some internal bleeding.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.960
Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.080
What are you talking about?

02:04.080 --> 02:06.360
- You've had a terrible fall.
- No, I haven't.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.320
Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.639
Angel...

02:13.120 --> 02:15.640
Give him your number. What?

02:15.680 --> 02:18.000
Give him your number. What?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.720
- Give him your number.
- Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.240
- Give him your number.
- What are you...? Come on.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.200
They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.320
- All right!
- It works!

02:32.000 --> 02:35.520
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.840
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.040
Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.880
It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.840
Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.080
I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.160
If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.360
Well, what's perfect?

02:55.360 --> 02:57.360
- It's not like I have a list.
- Oh, yes, you do.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.560
Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...

03:00.560 --> 03:02.240
- That's not hard. I know at least...
- I'm not done.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.360
She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.680
She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.880
That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.520
Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.480
Any Kim from any cool band, really.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.640
Can't be too picky.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.320
You're never going to find this girl.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.960
Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.320
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.040
So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.600
That's the plan.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.520
And little did I know, at that very moment, fate--

03:32.520 --> 03:36.440
in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer--

03:36.480 --> 03:38.240
was taking care of it.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.360
Whoa, you're up early.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.480
Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.440
Does Marshall know?

03:47.440 --> 03:49.240
He's still sound asleep.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.640
Awesome.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.760
So awesome.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.960
God! Best girl ever.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.560
Screw  these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.040
Please don't do that.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.040
Hey, is this milk any good?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.720
Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.640
God, why didn't you throw it away?

04:17.720 --> 04:20.320
I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.640
Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.760
What's wrong, baby?

04:29.960 --> 04:31.920
This is the high point of my day.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.000
It was true.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.680
See,  Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.120
But he needed money for the wedding,

04:38.120 --> 04:40.800
so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm...

04:40.800 --> 04:42.880
and he hated every minute of it.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.240
Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.360
Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.560
I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.360
Just take a look, will ya?

04:55.880 --> 04:58.240
Okay, corner office. Top floor.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.480
Check out that guy.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.440
Name's Clark Butterfield.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.800
He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West

05:04.800 --> 05:07.920
and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.120
So?

05:09.280 --> 05:12.000
So guess what I did to that sandwich?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.400
Here, I took a picture.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.680
Oh! Sweet Lord.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.920
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.680
Ooh!  Duck!

05:34.840 --> 05:36.600
That is sick!

05:39.280 --> 05:40.720
Why would you do that?

05:40.720 --> 05:44.200
Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.080
- You?
- Totally.

05:47.080 --> 05:52.040
Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.600
What?

05:53.600 --> 05:57.200
Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.960
This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule,

05:59.960 --> 06:01.880
call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.200
This is stupid.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.320
Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.120
I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.160
This is a job for me, Barney.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.040
It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.400
Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.280
Tracy, could you come in here, please?

06:24.920 --> 06:28.000
Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.800
Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...

06:31.800 --> 06:33.360
I get it. Thank you, Tracy.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.080
Hello?

06:40.080 --> 06:44.120
Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?

06:44.120 --> 06:45.000
Speaking.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.320
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.520
You signed up for our services about six months ago.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.440
Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.720
Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.280
We found her, sir.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.240
We found your soul mate.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.720
I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?

07:06.720 --> 07:09.320
Well, my firm bought out the company.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.760
You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate,

07:11.760 --> 07:16.240
but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so...

07:16.240 --> 07:17.720
here I am.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.680
So I'm in good hands.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.400
You found me a match?

07:21.400 --> 07:25.440
There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.600
No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.400
She's not engaged. She's your soul mate.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.080
Just read the file.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.240
So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.520
She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina,

07:43.520 --> 07:46.200
she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword,

07:46.200 --> 07:49.080
she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna,

07:49.080 --> 07:52.320
her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding

07:52.320 --> 07:55.560
and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.240
All right, fine. Set it up.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.000
You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?

08:03.000 --> 08:06.040
Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.800
Tastes normal to me.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.160
That's what I thought, too.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.000
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.320
Oh, God!

08:17.040 --> 08:18.640
It got me as well.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.000
Well, then why did you have me drink it?!

08:21.000 --> 08:24.480
Because now... you're in.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.280
Okay.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.120
Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you.

08:30.240 --> 08:34.840
But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.679
Let's make that bastard pay.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.400
You think that we should brush our teeth first?

08:39.400 --> 08:40.960
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.240
So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.240
I was so excited, I got there early.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.200
But before it even started...

08:52.000 --> 08:52.840
Lily?

08:52.840 --> 08:54.560
Hey, Ted, are you busy?

08:54.560 --> 08:56.720
Um... yes.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.080
Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.560
Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?

09:03.560 --> 09:06.200
What? What? No.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.880
Can't you just call Marshall?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.960
Marshall can't know about this.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.120
Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire,

09:13.120 --> 09:17.160
and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.480
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't, I'm waiting...

09:19.480 --> 09:22.880
Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?

09:22.880 --> 09:24.920
No, drifter, no!

09:24.920 --> 09:26.080
Come on, Lily.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.920
But you see my point.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.840
All right, stay there. I'm on my way.

09:36.280 --> 09:41.680
And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.600
Oh,  thank God.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.240
I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?

09:47.280 --> 09:47.920
Yes.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.040
And was she okay about pushing it back?

09:50.040 --> 09:52.760
Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.880
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.760
Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.760
I swear on Luke and Leia.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.760
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.

10:05.960 --> 10:09.520
Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.440
But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.160
Did you talk to Marshall about it?

10:15.160 --> 10:19.320
He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.240
So I spent my nights reading, painting,

10:26.240 --> 10:28.440
setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...

10:28.440 --> 10:29.920
That was you? Awesome!

10:29.920 --> 10:32.480
I know! I just got in the zone and...

10:32.480 --> 10:34.200
Not the point of the story.

10:34.240 --> 10:38.640
And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany,

10:38.640 --> 10:40.560
and I found that art fellowship.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.080
Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.000
San Francisco.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.080
But it's not like I'm going to do it.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.280
The dates conflict with the wedding.

10:50.320 --> 10:56.160
But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.280
This was a way to find out.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.880
And the interview is tonight.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.440
In New Haven.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.240
You don't want to get married.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.720
Of course I want to get married.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.160
I... It's not like I was ever going to do it.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.240
I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.320
Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.720
I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective.

11:24.760 --> 11:28.800
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.240
I think it's pretty clear what that means.

11:33.120 --> 11:37.360
Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.400
But I'm not any more.

11:40.400 --> 11:45.360
I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.800
I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.480
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.000
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do. Come here.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.600
It's okay. Look...

12:02.800 --> 12:05.840
Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.920
But why am I the only one?

12:07.920 --> 12:10.600
How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?

12:10.600 --> 12:14.640
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.520
All done.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.520
Ted, let's go to New Haven.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.200
Lily, don't do this to yourself.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.400
I just need to know if I can get in.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.320
If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know,

12:31.320 --> 12:33.560
and I can forget all about it, and get married.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.160
Come on! It's an adventure.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.840
No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.200
Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.240
But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake

12:44.240 --> 12:45.680
but you don't really know it's a mistake

12:45.720 --> 12:48.560
because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake,

12:48.600 --> 12:50.960
and look back, and say, "Yep. That was a mistake."

12:51.000 --> 12:54.240
So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake,

12:54.240 --> 12:57.840
because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.960
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!

13:00.000 --> 13:05.880
I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.560
Does any of this make sense to you?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.000
I don't know. You said "mistake" a lot.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.000
Lily, don't do this.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.280
Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out,

13:16.280 --> 13:19.360
and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.440
Forgive you for what? Lily.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.200
Lily!

13:27.240 --> 13:31.920
Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.320
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk...

13:35.320 --> 13:39.320
Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.120
And, also, I texted you the same thing.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.040
- Hey, I need a big favor.
- Anything, bro.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.160
I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.200
No.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.760
It's kind of an emergency.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.600
What are you doing in Duchess County?

13:59.640 --> 14:02.280
Apple picking. Can you just get up here?

14:02.320 --> 14:04.560
I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.040
We're kind of swamped.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.160
Is that Ted?

14:07.160 --> 14:09.000
Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.480
Don't you have a big date tonight?

14:10.480 --> 14:13.280
Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.640
So what are you doing in Duchess County?

14:15.760 --> 14:19.520
Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!

14:19.880 --> 14:21.840
Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.800
No!

14:22.800 --> 14:24.240
Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.

14:24.240 --> 14:28.080
No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.000
I'm not in Duchess County.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.000
So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?

14:33.040 --> 14:36.520
Yep. Gotcha! Classic!

14:36.520 --> 14:37.720
Gotta go.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.160
Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.960
You  know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people

14:47.960 --> 14:51.880
who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.040
Which is great, and everything, but

14:54.080 --> 14:56.520
I can't imagine having this much fun over there.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.680
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?

14:59.760 --> 15:00.920
Maybe.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.080
Don't tell Lily, okay?

15:03.120 --> 15:04.640
Taking off for the night.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.160
Thanks, Tracy.

15:06.160 --> 15:10.360
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?

15:10.480 --> 15:12.880
Of course we are.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.120
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.800
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.800
Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.360
Need a ride, cowboy?

15:23.360 --> 15:25.320
Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.680
Hmm, too bad. I got candy.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.360
Candy?!

15:31.360 --> 15:33.040
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing

15:33.040 --> 15:35.080
by the side of a highway in Duchess County?

15:35.080 --> 15:36.600
Nope. Sworn to secrecy.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.120
Oh, come on.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.560
- I like your hat.
- Right.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.440
This is embarrassing. I got highlights.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.040
Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice?

15:47.560 --> 15:50.240
- Highlights is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.880
I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean,

15:54.880 --> 15:57.920
"I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.480
- Oh. I gotta see this.
- No way.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.640
Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.880
I bet it looks grr-eat!

16:06.200 --> 16:09.560
So, she says, changing the subject.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.960
Big date tonight.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.520
How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?

16:13.520 --> 16:16.600
Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.120
Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.360
Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.880
Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.360
I read that.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.280
More like "Love in the Time of Don't Bothera."

16:30.640 --> 16:33.240
You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.920
We're not indoors. We're in a van.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.600
Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.600
Never. What else?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.560
- She loves lasagna.
- Barf.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.160
You know, I am sensing a pattern here.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.760
What else?

16:45.280 --> 16:48.800
Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.280
And she's looking to get married and have kids?

16:52.280 --> 16:54.920
Check and check. She wants two kids-- a boy and a girl.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.240
Wow.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.880
You know, I've been thinking about this.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.040
I think I want to have zero kids.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.720
Really? You don't want kids?

17:02.960 --> 17:06.880
You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.680
Hey. I'm driving.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.839
Look at that. 8:56. You're early.

17:16.839 --> 17:18.839
Hey, thanks for picking me up.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.319
Good luck on your date.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.760
I hope she's everything you're looking for.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.040
Thanks.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.440
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.600
I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh,

17:34.640 --> 17:35.880
here's what I'm going to do.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.320
You're going to show me your hair?

17:37.320 --> 17:41.240
Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.440
You just made my night.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.240
Go.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.760
Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package,

18:55.760 --> 18:59.280
and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.000
- Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.560
Hi.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.920
Hey.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.200
So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?

19:10.320 --> 19:13.640
Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.

19:13.720 --> 19:17.360
You think you might want to... drink the milk?

19:17.960 --> 19:19.080
No.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.440
Nope, I'm good.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.680
I don't need any milk.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.240
Look, guys, I know milk is important--

19:29.240 --> 19:31.880
it's got vitamin A, vitamin D,

19:31.880 --> 19:34.680
it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.240
How'd it go, dude?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.040
I didn't go.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.480
What? Why?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.960
I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.280
Why? She sounds perfect.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.040
I don't want perfect.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.120
I want Robin.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.480
Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.

19:52.480 --> 19:53.680
Maybe.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.640
But it's a mistake I have to make.

19:56.640 --> 20:00.200
Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.640
You and Robin have tried this again and again...

20:02.640 --> 20:04.280
Here's the thing about mistakes.

20:04.280 --> 20:07.080
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake,

20:07.080 --> 20:08.840
you gotta make it anyway.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.520
Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.120
Hey, is this milk any good?

20:18.800 --> 20:22.040
Even really really dumb mistakes.
