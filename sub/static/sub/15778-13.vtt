00:02.598 --> 00:05.089
Previously
on <i>The Venture Brothers...</i>

00:12.107 --> 00:14.667
or I will destroy your ridiculous cocoon...

00:15.778 --> 00:17.473
and all inside.

00:24.086 --> 00:25.610
Wait, wait, wait!

00:25.654 --> 00:28.122
Are we married yet?
Get the hell back here!

00:28.157 --> 00:31.388
I wish you both very much luck
in your new life together.

00:31.426 --> 00:33.724
What's left of it.

00:33.762 --> 00:35.957
Stay back, sir.
We got you covered.

00:36.431 --> 00:38.160
Hank!

00:38.200 --> 00:39.565
- Hank!
- I'm cool!

00:39.601 --> 00:42.570
OK! Try not to die!

00:42.604 --> 00:44.970
Go find your brother.
We're leaving.

00:47.943 --> 00:50.377
- Should we fire on them, sir?
- No.

00:50.412 --> 00:52.642
Let the rats desert the ship.

00:52.681 --> 00:55.650
It's the big fish rats we're after.

00:55.684 --> 00:58.517
- Monarch! What say you?
- I say, what kind of loser...

00:58.554 --> 01:00.749
can't get the hint
that he's been dumped?

01:00.789 --> 01:04.657
So, it's OK for you to kidnap her,
but when I do it, I'm a loser?

01:04.693 --> 01:08.857
This is, like, between you guys, right?
I mean, we can go? You don't need us?

01:08.897 --> 01:12.492
Hamilton G. Fantomas!
You are embarrassing yourself!

01:12.534 --> 01:16.129
Take your little
armada of cronies and go home!

01:16.171 --> 01:20.471
Sweet girl, you're being irrational.
And such is the curse of your sex.

01:20.509 --> 01:21.737
I forgive you.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.109
- <i>You</i> forgive <i>me?!</i>
- Are you blind?!

01:24.146 --> 01:27.582
Dude, she totally hates you!
She even told me you have bad breath.

01:27.616 --> 01:29.447
Honey, that's not the point here.

01:29.484 --> 01:31.577
Yes, it is!
I've had it with this dick!

01:31.620 --> 01:35.750
Then you leave me no choice!
Klaus! Iggy! Now!

01:41.563 --> 01:43.861
Kill him!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:46.468 --> 01:48.129
Honey? Do something.

01:48.170 --> 01:51.196
You traitorous bastards!
I should have known.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.208
I order you to stop!

01:53.242 --> 01:55.540
Thirty years
of taking orders from you, man.

01:55.577 --> 01:57.977
Thirty years of playing the idiot!

01:58.013 --> 02:00.345
Now you're gonna be my dog!

02:03.485 --> 02:06.454
- And pop!
- No way.

02:07.289 --> 02:10.190
Ding dong, the queen bitch is dead!

02:11.426 --> 02:14.190
Well, I got nothing to live for.
All right.

02:14.229 --> 02:18.791
I get the one dressed like Taco!
Brock, you get Spicoli!

02:18.834 --> 02:22.326
You might want to make your move,
'cause mine's gonna be ugly.

02:22.371 --> 02:24.532
Come on! Come on!

02:24.573 --> 02:26.803
So, you want
that up your ass?

02:30.579 --> 02:33.514
- What is this, plastic armor?
- All but the bow tie!

02:35.784 --> 02:38.651
- Did ve win?
- Kinda. Get the girl.

02:39.788 --> 02:42.154
A bonus.
Free smokes, man.

02:43.525 --> 02:47.017
Don't bother stamping your feet.
We don't do encores.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.829
Brock. Come in, Brock.
It's Dean. Dean Venture.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.236
I think I'm in trouble.

02:57.272 --> 02:59.297
Over.

02:59.374 --> 03:02.901
Pop? Come in, pop. Daddy?!

03:04.179 --> 03:08.479
Hank? Come in, Hank.
I'm in a spot. No, seriously.

03:08.517 --> 03:09.848
Hank?

03:09.885 --> 03:12.877
Henry Allen Venture! Pick up!

03:19.261 --> 03:22.458
Behold, the Ring of Power!

03:22.497 --> 03:25.625
Eons have we waited for he
who could wear the magic ring...

03:25.667 --> 03:28.227
and not melt or burst
into flames or something.

03:28.270 --> 03:31.068
Giant Boy Detective!
You're real!

03:31.106 --> 03:33.836
- Are we going to solve a mystery?
- No, young'n.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.843
We are going to save the Kingdom...

03:35.877 --> 03:38.675
and restore Princess Tingle Pants
to the throne.

03:38.714 --> 03:40.739
Then peace shall reign for eternity!

03:40.782 --> 03:42.147
OK.

03:42.184 --> 03:45.085
And solve
a super cool mystery?

03:46.989 --> 03:50.789
You're a short giant.
Aren't you, like, 30 feet tall in the books?

03:50.826 --> 03:53.317
If you think I'm a disappointment,
you should see Clifford.

03:53.362 --> 03:56.195
He's like those little dogs
rich ladies drag around.

03:56.231 --> 03:57.721
Plus he's more pink than red.

03:57.766 --> 04:02.362
Anyway... the magic flashlight
shall lead the way!

04:02.404 --> 04:05.396
Stupid f... enchanted batteries.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.305
Follow me!

04:07.342 --> 04:10.971
After we save the Venture family,
I say we take this thing to Aruba!

04:11.013 --> 04:13.481
And you all laughed at my speedos.

04:13.515 --> 04:15.915
I'm not sure how to fly this.

04:15.951 --> 04:20.216
Put the coordinates from your magic
crystals into the jet's flight computer!

04:20.255 --> 04:24.021
I can't do that! I can't even find
the other end of this seat belt!

04:24.059 --> 04:26.493
I can't help you
not save the Ventures...

04:26.528 --> 04:28.519
from back here in the kiddie seat.

04:28.563 --> 04:30.758
Why is creepo get to be the co-pilot?

04:32.467 --> 04:35.595
I wasn't the one who materialized him
from a trading card.

04:35.637 --> 04:37.832
Point of order, I wanted to kill him...

04:37.873 --> 04:41.309
because I bet
he's an abomination or something.

04:41.343 --> 04:43.641
And isn't there some code about that?

04:43.678 --> 04:48.775
Unless he's made from dead people,
it is still considered murder. Nice try.

04:48.817 --> 04:51.342
Got it! It was all crammed
into the cushion.

04:51.386 --> 04:54.355
What if he gets hit by a car
and he's half-dead?

04:54.389 --> 04:56.721
I had this dog
once that never...

04:59.494 --> 05:01.792
I hope he knows
where we are going.

05:01.830 --> 05:04.526
I hope he couldn't understand
what I said about him.

05:06.234 --> 05:09.101
We have to get her back!
We have to rescue her!

05:09.137 --> 05:10.695
Daddy's coming, baby!

05:10.739 --> 05:14.004
What are you, crazy?
Scratch that. You're a lunatic.

05:14.042 --> 05:17.170
There's an armada
of Guild WASPs out there...

05:17.212 --> 05:19.180
waiting to spank our ass!

05:19.214 --> 05:23.344
- Now, this thing flies, right?
- She is the pride of the poison skies.

05:23.385 --> 05:26.912
Then fire her up
and show me what this...

05:26.955 --> 05:28.582
cocoon can do.

05:28.623 --> 05:30.523
You!
You got weapons in this place?

05:30.559 --> 05:32.151
Yeah. Armory's fully stocked.

05:32.194 --> 05:35.755
We just came back from south
of the border. I got an assload of M-80s.

05:35.797 --> 05:39.927
Great! Organize a strike team,
take 'em down there, and get 'em ready.

05:39.968 --> 05:42.198
We're goin' after Dr. Girlfriend.

05:42.237 --> 05:43.727
Henchmen! Listen up...

05:43.772 --> 05:46.104
Hold up there!
Who's running this cocoon?!

05:46.141 --> 05:48.974
Fine, then you give the order.

05:49.010 --> 05:52.537
Minions!
They like that better than "Henchmen."

05:52.581 --> 05:55.607
Battle stations!

06:01.056 --> 06:04.253
Magenta?
That's your battle mode color?

06:04.292 --> 06:06.487
Eat a d...! And thanks.

06:07.529 --> 06:11.124
Minions!
Prepare to launch!

06:12.467 --> 06:15.163
That's my seat, jackass!
And what is this?

06:15.203 --> 06:17.603
What is this?!
That's for the reception!

06:17.639 --> 06:18.731
Sorry.

06:20.842 --> 06:22.469
Get off of me!

06:22.511 --> 06:24.604
You creepy jerk.
What are you, anyway?!

06:24.646 --> 06:26.910
What are you supposed
to be from the future?

06:26.948 --> 06:30.076
And you, would you put a shirt on,
for God's sakes?

06:30.118 --> 06:33.849
Where do you get off siccing
your two stooges on me?

06:33.889 --> 06:35.220
I vasn't in <i>The Stooges.</i>

06:35.257 --> 06:37.987
Just saving you
from a life of regret, my dear.

06:38.026 --> 06:41.723
Not to mention a fiery grave
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

06:41.763 --> 06:45.563
Now, what say you slip out
of that tacky little white lie...

06:45.600 --> 06:48.899
put on your Queen Etherea costume...

06:48.937 --> 06:51.735
and take your rightful place by my side?

06:51.773 --> 06:54.537
Is everybody delusional today?

06:54.576 --> 06:57.977
What do you think the Sovereign
will do to you when he finds out...

06:58.013 --> 07:01.141
you borrowed his entire army
to fight your lovers' quarrel?

07:01.183 --> 07:04.914
You'll throw away your whole career
just to get back at The Monarch?

07:04.953 --> 07:06.045
Over me?

07:06.087 --> 07:08.885
If you'd shown half as much passion,
during the...

07:08.924 --> 07:11.757
What the f... do those creeps
keep laughing at?

07:11.793 --> 07:15.786
Well, I suspect the Sovereign
will be quite all right with it.

07:15.830 --> 07:19.459
You see... you're looking at him.

07:21.169 --> 07:23.296
Strangers! Attack!

07:26.174 --> 07:28.972
- Engines online!
- Book!

07:30.000 --> 07:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:40.989 --> 07:44.516
So, it's a cocoon...

07:44.559 --> 07:45.787
that flies.

07:45.827 --> 07:48.421
- Obviously.
- I just realized that makes no sense.

07:48.463 --> 07:52.331
Duh! Monarch? Butterfly?
Butterfly, cocoon?

07:52.367 --> 07:53.959
- It's a theme thing.
- Yeah.

07:54.002 --> 07:57.460
I get it, but why didn't you
just make it shaped like a butterfly?

07:57.505 --> 07:59.370
Because that's gay?

07:59.407 --> 08:04.743
All right. With a show of hands,
how many of you are suicidal?

08:06.781 --> 08:10.217
OK, now,
how many of you love change?

08:10.252 --> 08:12.743
- Here he comes, boys!
- Oh, thank God!

08:12.787 --> 08:15.255
Now, I want you to give
our new commander...

08:15.290 --> 08:18.225
all the respect you were
supposed to give 24.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.251
Listen up!

08:20.295 --> 08:24.925
I know that...
I have beat on most of you in the past...

08:24.966 --> 08:27.833
- I forgive you, Brock Samson!
- I was asking for it!

08:27.869 --> 08:29.268
I love you, Brock Samson!

08:29.304 --> 08:34.037
...but we have to put all that aside,
and focus on getting Dr. Girlfriend back.

08:34.075 --> 08:37.909
Now, God knows, a child
could take you guys one on one...

08:37.946 --> 08:39.971
We do the best we can. We try.

08:40.015 --> 08:44.111
...but as a swarm,
even you guys can be dangerous!

08:44.152 --> 08:47.178
Welcome to Big Boy Town!

08:47.222 --> 08:50.680
As of this moment,
you are no longer butterflies!

08:50.725 --> 08:55.094
Today, you are murderflies!

08:57.065 --> 08:59.625
In one decisive blow,
we go for the head...

08:59.668 --> 09:01.863
cut it off,
and watch the body die!

09:01.903 --> 09:05.304
We all fly
for Phantom Limb's command ship!

09:06.341 --> 09:09.469
- What?
- We don't have anything to fly in.

09:09.511 --> 09:12.480
We just have a Monarch Mobile
and a Nissan Stanza.

09:12.514 --> 09:13.572
You all have wings.

09:13.615 --> 09:16.379
Yeah, these are for showin',
not for blowin'.

09:16.418 --> 09:18.249
No way! They work!

09:18.286 --> 09:22.313
What? Total gyp! Why didn't
anybody tell us these things worked?!

09:22.357 --> 09:26.123
- This changes everything.
- I wanna come with! I wanna help!

09:26.161 --> 09:29.062
Not this time, Hank.
It's too dangerous.

09:29.097 --> 09:31.395
Come on, let me at 'em, Brock!

09:31.433 --> 09:32.957
I probably know judo!

09:33.001 --> 09:35.401
How many of <i>those</i> guys
can make the same boast?

09:35.437 --> 09:36.563
No.

09:36.604 --> 09:39.402
Why must you be the screen door
on my submarine, Brock?

09:39.441 --> 09:40.931
The answer's no, Hank!

09:40.975 --> 09:44.741
Now go find your brother
and hide under something heavy.

09:44.779 --> 09:47.942
And there came
a savior to our world.

09:47.982 --> 09:51.247
And he was known as Dean.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.584
Dean the brave.

09:53.621 --> 09:57.580
Though only a child himself,
it has been prophesied...

09:57.625 --> 10:02.358
that he will free
the enslaved orphans of Insectia.

10:02.397 --> 10:07.164
Giant Boy Detective,
show me this mighty warrior you speak of.

10:07.202 --> 10:08.669
OK. But don't be judgmental.

10:08.703 --> 10:10.796
- You must keep an open mind.
- I always do.

10:10.839 --> 10:13.933
- You're kidding, right?
- You're the one who's always judgmental.

10:13.975 --> 10:16.739
Are you insane?!
You're always like "Hey, fella...

10:16.778 --> 10:19.975
"you might wanna roll up
the windows in this neighborhood."

10:20.014 --> 10:22.380
- Am I doing it now?
- No, but...

10:22.417 --> 10:25.147
Then show me
the friggin' warrior already!

10:26.187 --> 10:28.815
- Behind the little kid?
- See? You always do this.

10:28.857 --> 10:31.917
What?! I'm not being judgmental!
I'm making a judgment!

10:31.960 --> 10:34.554
- There is a huge difference...
- This is just stupid!

10:34.596 --> 10:37.064
You bother
the Great White Oracle for this?

10:37.098 --> 10:41.125
That shivering child? Clearly he is
incompetent and I bet he's a sissy.

10:41.169 --> 10:42.659
Yeah! Or a cry baby.

10:42.704 --> 10:45.730
Is this true?
Is baby gonna cry?

10:45.774 --> 10:49.369
- Like a whittle baby cry?
- I'm not a cry baby!

10:49.411 --> 10:52.539
Don't kid yourself there.
You're a bit of a pussy.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.548
- No offense.
- I can do this!

10:54.582 --> 10:58.643
I am the chosen one!
I have the Ring of Power!

10:59.587 --> 11:02.385
- Your princess is completely screwed.
- There's a princess?

11:02.424 --> 11:04.722
Sure, and she is a looker!

11:04.759 --> 11:07.057
Please!
She dresses like a whore.

11:07.095 --> 11:09.586
Go! Go! Go! Go!

11:13.268 --> 11:14.929
Go! Go! Go! Go!

11:15.603 --> 11:18.231
Hold up, soldier.
We launch in waves.

11:21.810 --> 11:23.334
So, where you from, son?

11:23.378 --> 11:28.008
I am exchange henchman
from Russian Supervillain.

11:28.049 --> 11:32.042
Ya picked a helluva time to come over.
OK, you're up.

11:32.086 --> 11:34.611
See you on the other side, comrade!

11:45.533 --> 11:49.128
Stick close and follow my lead.
You'll make it through this, soldier.

11:49.170 --> 11:51.536
- Oh, thanks, Brock.
- Hank?!

11:51.573 --> 11:54.474
Damn it, Hank!
What did I?

11:55.510 --> 11:57.307
We'll talk about this later!

11:57.345 --> 12:01.509
Henchmen! Like we planned.
Use the canyon for cover!

12:01.549 --> 12:05.417
Maintain battle formations.
And use those safety catches!

12:05.453 --> 12:08.320
No clumping up like a JV soccer team!

12:08.356 --> 12:12.087
Keep an erratic flight path!
Don't let them put a bead on ya!

12:12.126 --> 12:14.959
It's fire then fall back!
Fire then fall back!

12:14.996 --> 12:18.830
Dozens of them! Everywhere!
Coming at us! All sides!

12:18.867 --> 12:21.961
Stay on The Monarch!
B-Squad! Fall back and regroup.

12:22.003 --> 12:24.938
Let the flies come to the spider's web.

12:24.973 --> 12:26.804
Come on, man, let me get 'em!

12:26.841 --> 12:30.971
I'm a streetwalkin' cheetah
with a heart fulla napalm! Gimme danger!

12:31.012 --> 12:33.742
Calm yourself!
I need you here to protect my queen.

12:33.781 --> 12:36.909
- Yes, Sovereign.
- This is insane.

12:36.951 --> 12:39.283
There's no way
you can be the Sovereign!

12:39.320 --> 12:43.654
I've seen him chew you out over that TV...
whatever thing. The screen thing.

12:43.691 --> 12:45.989
- Telescreen.
- You stay out of this!

12:46.027 --> 12:47.858
God, you two skeeve me!

12:47.896 --> 12:51.559
Didn't you get the memo?
The old Sovereign is dead.

12:51.599 --> 12:53.499
I've given myself a promotion.

12:53.535 --> 12:56.299
You killed him.
You killed him, didn't you?

12:56.337 --> 13:00.706
Not me personally, but it was
my invisible hand which guided the...

13:00.742 --> 13:02.801
Well, I don't have to tell <i>you</i> that.

13:02.844 --> 13:05.369
- You were there.
- Bowie?!

13:05.413 --> 13:08.871
Quite a bean in that pretty little head.
Give the lady a prize!

13:08.917 --> 13:12.182
So this thing with The Monarch.
Then this was all a...

13:12.220 --> 13:13.983
- A front?!
- Oh, dear.

13:14.022 --> 13:19.050
You didn't really think all of this
was just about you, did you?

13:19.093 --> 13:21.687
No, thanks.
I have to save <i>mein</i> voice.

13:22.730 --> 13:25.290
The smoking? Outside!

13:27.068 --> 13:29.127
Dude, what are you doing over here?

13:29.170 --> 13:32.367
I'm not good at turning yet.
I'm just flying all over the place.

13:32.407 --> 13:36.070
Squad E is down and my squad
is mostly on fire. I need you!

13:36.110 --> 13:38.510
Was it you guys
that got caught in that engine?

13:38.546 --> 13:41.447
- No, that's an urban myth.
- What does that even mean?!

13:41.482 --> 13:45.646
How can you start an urban myth
with flying guys in the Grand Canyon?

13:45.687 --> 13:49.350
Knock off all that chatter!
We're comin' up on the target!

13:52.193 --> 13:54.218
Man, this is ridiculous.

13:55.296 --> 13:57.890
God, it's friggin' cold, man.

13:59.934 --> 14:01.265
Hello. I'm David Bowie.

14:01.302 --> 14:04.829
- What the?
- Make way for the homo superior!

14:04.872 --> 14:08.501
But you're still chasing him?
Why? You got what you came for.

14:08.543 --> 14:13.537
Because, my dear, I've finally learned
how to mix business with pleasure!

14:13.581 --> 14:15.412
Your champagne's getting warm.

14:18.453 --> 14:22.719
It's wicked bad out there, sir.
I didn't mean to let you down.

14:23.691 --> 14:28.822
These five minutes under your command
have been... the proudest...

14:28.863 --> 14:30.956
of my... career.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.070
What are you waiting for, soldier?

14:38.106 --> 14:41.405
Bogeys on your ten and two.
Take 'em out!

14:45.246 --> 14:47.544
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

14:47.582 --> 14:51.541
Henchmen! We're all clear.
Move in on the command ship!

14:51.586 --> 14:53.816
Turn, tiny engines!

14:54.856 --> 15:00.055
Let your agony be the power
that turns the engine of my black heart!

15:00.094 --> 15:02.654
Turn, my orphans!

15:02.697 --> 15:05.291
Turn me on!

15:07.935 --> 15:09.459
Dean the Brave!

15:09.504 --> 15:13.304
Your reign of extra badness
is over, Insect King!

15:13.341 --> 15:17.641
I shall destroy you
as easily as I destroyed your father.

15:17.679 --> 15:19.044
He didn't have...

15:19.080 --> 15:21.878
the ring of power!

15:21.916 --> 15:25.079
No, not the ring of power!

15:25.119 --> 15:28.179
It's the only thing
that can steal my black heart!

15:28.222 --> 15:29.587
Eat it!

15:30.625 --> 15:33.992
That... ing hurts!
Right down to the thorax!

15:34.028 --> 15:37.691
Dick!
But it missed my black heart!

15:37.732 --> 15:38.790
Die!

15:38.833 --> 15:43.133
Dude, stop already!
You're not even aiming for my black heart!

15:43.171 --> 15:44.536
I vanquish you!

15:44.572 --> 15:47.439
Come on,
those are reproductive organs!

15:47.475 --> 15:50.808
Will you take the f... ing hint
and stab me in the heart already?!

15:50.845 --> 15:54.838
I got it! Your evil black heart
is where your power comes from!

15:54.882 --> 15:58.784
Oh, no!
You have learned my terrible secret!

16:08.996 --> 16:12.397
Now we must destroy
his evil machinery!

16:12.433 --> 16:14.560
Run, orphans, be free!

16:14.602 --> 16:17.230
And have your own room
and maybe not have to live...

16:17.271 --> 16:20.172
in fear of costumed guys
trying to kill you all the time!

16:20.208 --> 16:24.474
And with no yaddies freaking out on you,
or, like, putting you on a rocket ship.

16:24.512 --> 16:26.844
Run to a place where your father...

16:26.881 --> 16:30.282
will make you get
in a fight with a Venus Flytrap...

16:30.318 --> 16:31.876
and wands and with a gun!

16:35.690 --> 16:38.056
What's going on?
I got no go here!

16:38.092 --> 16:41.823
Here's something.
We just lost power, like, all of it.

16:41.863 --> 16:44.491
- Where'd it go?
- Well, I don't know. Somewhere?

16:44.532 --> 16:46.295
- Not in the engine.
- What?!

16:46.334 --> 16:49.201
Someone go to the engine room
and find out what happened!

16:49.237 --> 16:52.434
No. No way.
That place is spooky.

16:52.473 --> 16:55.169
Do you pay these people?

16:55.209 --> 16:58.144
Wanna see my escape cocoon?

17:07.954 --> 17:11.288
- Bowie.
- That's "Sovereign" to you.

17:14.395 --> 17:16.886
What say?

17:18.232 --> 17:19.256
Check it!

17:19.300 --> 17:22.929
It's like Dracula
versus Yoda in there!

17:22.970 --> 17:26.269
The bolt cutters!
You were in charge of the bolt cutters!

17:26.307 --> 17:27.365
Cut me some slack!

17:27.407 --> 17:30.639
I wasn't getting any altitude.
I had to drop ballast.

17:30.678 --> 17:34.444
- That's why my shoes aren't even on.
- Panicked. The man panicked.

17:34.482 --> 17:37.940
You didn't see me throwing Certs
out of my pocket, anything.

17:37.985 --> 17:40.146
This is useless.

17:42.423 --> 17:44.084
What the deuce was that?!

17:44.125 --> 17:47.617
I don't care! We're gonna crash
into that flying vase-thing!

17:47.662 --> 17:50.563
Can't you put
a magic protective bubble around us?

17:50.598 --> 17:54.090
Join hands.
Our powers are stronger as a team!

17:54.135 --> 17:57.070
No, they're not.
I'm a blackula hunter, I don't have powers.

17:57.104 --> 17:59.902
I got a magic powder
that turns mosquitoes into bats!

17:59.941 --> 18:01.568
But if you want to join hands...

18:01.609 --> 18:05.067
Come on! Come on,
I wanna go with you guys!

18:05.112 --> 18:07.637
F... off! It only seats two. Two!

18:09.617 --> 18:12.245
Or would you prefer
an escape butterfly?

18:16.958 --> 18:22.919
Because you are the chosen one,
you have saved Insectia.

18:22.964 --> 18:26.866
I can once again
take my rightful place...

18:26.901 --> 18:31.497
as the beautiful and approachable
princess of everything.

18:31.539 --> 18:34.633
That sounds nifty!
But I think we should...

18:34.675 --> 18:36.438
make-out.

18:39.113 --> 18:40.444
I love you!

18:44.685 --> 18:48.280
That little guy we made?
All over the windshield.

18:48.322 --> 18:50.950
Watch your feet.
I think its head is out there.

18:50.992 --> 18:52.584
Byron Orpheus, magic guy.

18:52.627 --> 18:56.358
Never flown an experimental jet before.
Magic.

18:56.397 --> 18:59.332
A dog dragon!
Wait here with the orphans!

18:59.367 --> 19:02.495
I must free Giant Boy Detective
from the Spider Queen!

19:02.536 --> 19:06.905
That's the scrawny Venture kid.
And he's crazier than usual.

19:06.941 --> 19:10.001
To the castle in the clouds! Fly!

19:10.044 --> 19:13.946
He's snapped, lost touch
with this world and created another!

19:13.981 --> 19:16.677
We must spirit him to safety!

19:16.717 --> 19:19.208
He's creepy.
I am so not gonna touch him.

19:21.789 --> 19:23.279
No way!

19:33.534 --> 19:36.799
Dude.
Nobody tells me anything!

19:36.837 --> 19:39.169
Did anybody else know this?

19:41.475 --> 19:44.103
Again! Again! Again!

19:45.846 --> 19:46.938
Pookums!

19:47.982 --> 19:49.813
I'm so glad you're...

19:49.850 --> 19:53.377
Hi, David... Bowie.
Have you seen...

19:53.421 --> 19:55.252
I'm over here!

19:55.289 --> 19:58.417
Sweetness! There you a...
Oh, crap! Are you OK?

19:58.459 --> 20:02.862
Tell me you're not paralyzed, because
that would be so unfair to... both of us.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.228
I'm fine, I just...

20:05.232 --> 20:08.929
There. I was pinned under...
I think it's Phantom Limb's leg.

20:08.970 --> 20:13.066
Give it here! I want to kick
his smug limey face in with it!

20:13.107 --> 20:14.369
He's gone.

20:14.408 --> 20:17.969
No doubt a secret escape hatch
or some such nonsense.

20:18.012 --> 20:21.345
God, how <i>cliché</i>
can one man get?

20:21.382 --> 20:23.543
Great!
Now I have a new arch-enemy.

20:23.584 --> 20:27.953
I wouldn't concern yourself. There won't
be a corner of the globe he'll be safe in...

20:27.989 --> 20:31.220
once I sic the Diamond Dogs on his scent.
Well, gotta run, love.

20:31.258 --> 20:34.659
Vicious coup to squash,
strangers to execute, you know how it is.

20:34.695 --> 20:38.461
Congratulations, both of you! Ta!

20:39.500 --> 20:42.492
- Doc, you OK?
- I swallowed a gold filling in the crash...

20:42.536 --> 20:46.404
so we have to hook up the metal detector
to the toilet again. What'd we miss?

20:46.440 --> 20:49.102
The guy from <i>Labyrinth</i>
turned into a bird!

20:49.143 --> 20:52.306
OK. So the Sovereign recorded
<i>Station To Station?</i>

20:52.346 --> 20:54.837
And <i>Changes One?</i>
Love that album!

20:54.882 --> 20:58.249
Could you be a bigger poser?
<i>Changes</i> is a <i>Best of!</i>

20:58.953 --> 21:00.784
Don't panic!

21:00.821 --> 21:02.789
Dean is safe!

21:02.823 --> 21:06.919
Safe in the magic hands
of the Order of the...

21:09.063 --> 21:12.032
- Hey, pop.
- Dean was missing? Nice job, Brock.

21:12.066 --> 21:14.694
Peoples, somebody here
lose an invisible...

21:16.370 --> 21:17.428
I'm keeping this.

21:47.101 --> 21:50.195
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined!

21:55.309 --> 21:58.506
- He gonna be OK up there?
- Yeah, he does this all the time.

21:58.546 --> 22:02.380
He'll pass out in a couple of minutes
and we'll go up and get him.

22:04.051 --> 22:05.814
You're insatiable, woman!

22:05.853 --> 22:09.345
That's one myth about married life
we can scratch off the list.

22:09.390 --> 22:13.884
- You know, I never actually said "I do."
- You never said you don't.

22:13.928 --> 22:17.329
Well, there's something else
I haven't said.

22:17.364 --> 22:21.061
It... It might... change things.

22:21.102 --> 22:24.094
Is it "Let's go again?"
Because I'm gonna need a few...

22:24.138 --> 22:25.400
No.

22:25.439 --> 22:27.407
OK, deep breath.

22:28.442 --> 22:31.502
Sheila, you've been rehearsing this.

22:33.647 --> 22:35.945
Monarch, I'm...

22:37.184 --> 22:38.845
What?!

22:38.886 --> 22:41.855
<i>Qu'ils mangent de la soupe.</i>
