WEBVTT

00:15.062 --> 00:18.565
Whoa there, hoss! You're jumpier
than a frog on Texas Tarmac.

00:22.861 --> 00:27.032
I reckon you got lucky, Ricochet.
Won't happen again!

00:48.929 --> 00:50.055
Time, gentlemen!

00:50.597 --> 00:54.268
You see? My skill-enhancement suits
work perfectly.

00:54.434 --> 00:58.981
And a slight adjustment
to your kinetic energy regulator...

00:59.147 --> 01:02.234
...will put even more
"ric" in your "ochet."

01:04.027 --> 01:07.698
- Nice moves, partners.
- Thanks.

01:07.864 --> 01:10.284
So, Ox, if Montana is Shocker...

01:10.450 --> 01:12.953
...and Fancy Dan is Ricochet...

01:13.120 --> 01:14.371
-...what do we--?
- Ox.

01:14.538 --> 01:17.791
- That works.
- Well, chief, what do you think?

01:19.585 --> 01:22.170
I like what I see.

02:34.201 --> 02:36.370
You went to the Enforcers?

02:36.536 --> 02:38.038
Good morning, Hammerhead.

02:38.205 --> 02:41.750
Since when does the Big Man
go straight to the hired help?

02:41.917 --> 02:44.211
Silvermane is being released
from prison...

02:44.378 --> 02:46.046
...and Doctor Octopus looms.

02:46.213 --> 02:50.384
With a gang war on the horizon,
I must build my war chest.

02:50.550 --> 02:53.637
Why am I suddenly out of the loop?

02:53.804 --> 02:58.475
After the oil tanker fiasco and the
Rhino specs acquisition failure...

02:58.642 --> 03:01.770
...I assumed you had too much
on your plate.

03:03.146 --> 03:05.232
Especially, since job one
was creating...

03:05.399 --> 03:07.275
...super-villains
to distract Spider-Man.

03:07.442 --> 03:10.987
With all the freaks running around,
Spidey's distracted enough.

03:11.154 --> 03:13.407
Why spend money
on what we can get for free?

03:13.573 --> 03:14.908
Control.

03:16.743 --> 03:20.956
You used to know that.
Shut the door on your way out.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.922
<i>Life is so sweet.</i>

03:29.089 --> 03:31.967
<i>The old Peter Parker would have been
stuck in that traffic jam.</i>

03:32.676 --> 03:36.096
<i>But not the Spectacular Spider-Man!</i>

03:40.559 --> 03:41.768
Hey, Sha Shan.

03:41.935 --> 03:45.063
Wanna see the pass that won us
the State Championship?

03:45.230 --> 03:46.273
Not really.

03:53.864 --> 03:56.283
Hey, Brown, get the ball!

03:56.950 --> 03:59.619
No, no, no!

04:04.124 --> 04:06.376
<i>Okay, maybe not so sweet.</i>

04:08.503 --> 04:11.590
All right. Time to choose partners
for tonight's police ride-along.

04:11.757 --> 04:14.676
Remember,
this is an educational endeavour...

04:14.843 --> 04:18.846
...a front row seat at how the police
operate, not a social activity.

04:19.014 --> 04:21.725
- Is it really that bad?
- It really is.

04:21.892 --> 04:24.060
But you'll clean up
and we'll still be partners.

04:24.227 --> 04:26.730
So no arguments
over who rides with whom.

04:26.897 --> 04:28.648
Names are in the hat.

04:28.815 --> 04:30.984
- Is he serious?
- Come on!

04:32.611 --> 04:37.532
Sorry, Hobes, I want first shot at--
Harry Osborn?!

04:37.699 --> 04:39.951
- Wait, I wanna do-over!
- Hobie Brown.

04:41.244 --> 04:43.121
Don't say it.

04:48.835 --> 04:50.962
Gwen Stacy.

04:54.508 --> 04:55.717
Mark Allan.

04:59.471 --> 05:02.891
- It says Rand Robertson.
- Rand's not even in this class.

05:05.101 --> 05:07.646
Fine, it says stinky Pete!
You happy now?

05:10.982 --> 05:12.526
<i>"Stinky Pete"?</i>

05:12.692 --> 05:15.821
<i>Like "Puny Parker" isn't bad enough.</i>

05:16.112 --> 05:18.615
<i>At least I had time to shower
before the ride-along.</i> ..

05:18.782 --> 05:20.659
<i>...with the ever-personable
Miss Avril...</i>

05:20.826 --> 05:22.911
<i>...who I can't believe
I used to have a crush on.</i>

05:31.628 --> 05:34.464
Flash, Harry. You're with
Sergeant Carter and Officer DeWolff.

05:36.341 --> 05:40.178
- So you two rookies ready?
- Let the thrills begin!

05:40.345 --> 05:43.682
Thrills? Please.
They're not taking us anywhere cool.

05:43.849 --> 05:46.226
Not with Norman Osborn's
spawn in the car.

05:47.561 --> 05:49.604
Besides, cops don't handle
the real threats anymore.

05:49.771 --> 05:52.190
Spider-Man takes down
all the genuine Big Bads!

05:52.357 --> 05:55.986
What makes you think your costumed
vigilante isn't a Big Bad himself?

05:56.152 --> 05:59.281
Oh, come on, DeWolff. Kid's just
saying what everyone's thinking.

05:59.447 --> 06:01.157
Look, Sarge, we've been through this.

06:01.324 --> 06:03.368
Spider-Man means well, probably.

06:03.535 --> 06:06.705
But when he takes the law
into his own hands, he goes too far.

06:06.872 --> 06:10.000
If you ask me,
Spidey hasn't gone far enough.

06:11.209 --> 06:12.544
Bank heist? Really?

06:12.711 --> 06:15.755
-Isn't that a bit beneath you?
- Nothing wrong with a good heist...

06:15.922 --> 06:19.259
-...if the take is worth our while.
-"Our" while?

06:28.310 --> 06:32.105
Bug, meet the New Enforcers.

06:43.950 --> 06:46.202
Great field trip, Dad.

06:50.832 --> 06:52.500
Perfect. Parker's late.

06:52.667 --> 06:57.297
So now I'm stuck with King Geek
and the teacher. No of fence.

07:01.843 --> 07:03.887
The New Enforcers?

07:04.429 --> 07:06.765
Yeah, gotta love those
heart-tugging reunion shows.

07:06.932 --> 07:09.517
Enough jawing.
Ox, you're up.

07:13.647 --> 07:15.273
Ricochet, go.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.317
Ox?
Ricochet?

07:17.484 --> 07:20.570
Those names might sound cool
back at the ranch but...

07:24.240 --> 07:26.910
We're just getting started, Spidey.

07:30.538 --> 07:33.708
Ox is right.
We got us a strict timetable.

07:33.875 --> 07:37.462
Reckon we'll have to squash
you later, bug.

07:38.296 --> 07:39.881
Well, maybe just one for the road.

07:44.386 --> 07:46.096
It's pre-Columbian.

07:46.262 --> 07:50.225
Some believe the wearer actually
takes on the personality of the mask.

07:50.392 --> 07:53.645
Whatever.
Big Man wants another super-villain.

07:53.812 --> 07:56.731
Same deal as before.
You in?

07:56.898 --> 07:58.525
Happy to oblige.

07:58.692 --> 08:01.403
I've found a new scientist
to oversee the project.

08:01.569 --> 08:06.116
Someone whose temperament
is more in line with these endeavours.

08:06.282 --> 08:08.952
Someone who understands
how the world works today...

08:09.119 --> 08:11.204
...and isn't afraid to make it his.

08:11.371 --> 08:12.956
I presume in your line of work...

08:13.123 --> 08:16.960
...those are the qualities
it takes to be in charge.

08:17.127 --> 08:20.463
No doubt the Big Man
has those qualities.

08:20.630 --> 08:25.969
And I'm sure he knows
you have those qualities as well.

08:27.512 --> 08:30.265
- You're late.
-|...

08:30.849 --> 08:36.438
- Crashed your bike?
- Yeah! Yeah, my bike. Good guess.

08:36.855 --> 08:38.523
What? Back there?

08:38.690 --> 08:40.650
You mean, I have to sit
next to him too?

08:41.150 --> 08:45.613
So, Mary Jane, who'd you really
want to partner with?

08:45.780 --> 08:49.492
- I'm not really a partner person.
- I hear you.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.370
I mean, everyone's always bugging
about who goes out with who.

08:52.537 --> 08:55.582
Yeah. As if a night out
has to be life-changing.

08:55.749 --> 08:57.542
What's wrong
with just having a little fun?

08:59.419 --> 09:02.213
You and me, we should show them
how to do it right.

09:02.380 --> 09:05.050
A date? But not a "date" date.

09:05.216 --> 09:09.137
Are we on a ride-along
or a "ride-along" ride-along?

09:10.180 --> 09:13.475
A real bank robbery?
You've got to admit, this is cool.

09:13.641 --> 09:18.271
No, OsBrat. This is boring.
A robbery in progress would be cool.

09:18.438 --> 09:21.941
Captain, I knew Spider-Man
couldn't be trusted.

09:22.108 --> 09:24.069
This mess is all your fault.

09:24.235 --> 09:28.364
- Me? I'd never rob a bank.
- Not this, you dweeb.

09:28.531 --> 09:30.075
The social order.

09:30.241 --> 09:33.620
You crossed clique lines and put
some kind of geek-spell on Liz.

09:33.787 --> 09:35.914
And now, no one at M-cubed
knows their place!

09:36.081 --> 09:39.626
Even Flash is trying to date a nerd
and she's saying, "No!"

09:39.793 --> 09:41.127
No of fence, Flash.

09:41.294 --> 09:44.255
Oh, that mess.

09:45.131 --> 09:46.758
Sorry?

09:48.051 --> 09:50.303
Damage doesn't fit
the Spider's MO.

09:50.470 --> 09:52.138
I'd guess he fought someone here.

09:52.305 --> 09:54.349
- Go, Spidey!
- What's this?

09:59.020 --> 10:01.272
This hole leads to the dry cleaner's
next door.

10:01.439 --> 10:03.274
Perps tried to hide it.
Call the owner.

10:03.441 --> 10:06.236
- Find out if anything's missing.
- A dry cleaner's?

10:06.736 --> 10:10.615
<i>Why would the New Enforcers
rob</i> a <i>dry cleaner's?</i>

10:12.784 --> 10:14.953
Incoming shipment.

10:15.703 --> 10:18.373
So, Gwen.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.875
You and Harry seem
to be getting along great.

10:21.042 --> 10:25.505
He's a great guy.
And you two make a great couple.

10:25.672 --> 10:28.007
Yeah, we're great.

10:29.008 --> 10:31.886
And you and Peter
make a great couple too.

10:32.053 --> 10:34.848
Yeah. We do.

10:36.975 --> 10:40.145
Hey, whoa, whoa, wrong way.
You want--

10:45.483 --> 10:49.112
Elevator kill-switch disabled.
You got the monitor link on redirect?

10:54.492 --> 10:56.536
Party time, boys.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.788
Let's get fancy.

11:03.376 --> 11:06.254
Captain.
Owner of the dry cleaner's.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.340
Look, what's the dealio?

11:09.507 --> 11:12.594
I thought we got past the whole
geek-torment thing last fall.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.930
We did. Until you ditched
the team right before playoffs...

11:16.097 --> 11:18.057
...to go to Europe with mommy.

11:18.224 --> 11:20.476
Hobie stepped up
and we won State anyway.

11:20.643 --> 11:22.437
Of course, if I'd had a guy
with your speed...

11:22.604 --> 11:24.355
...I might've gotten off
the winning pass sooner.

11:24.522 --> 11:25.982
And I wouldn't have taken this hit.

11:26.149 --> 11:30.445
Yeah, the thing is
I was drinking this stuff.

11:30.612 --> 11:35.450
Globulin Green.
It got bad and I had to go away.

11:35.617 --> 11:39.412
You were playing...juiced?
Do you know what this means?

11:39.579 --> 11:42.749
If anyone finds out, the games
you played in would be disqualified...

11:42.916 --> 11:44.626
...along with our championship.

11:47.212 --> 11:49.839
I'd have messed up my knee
for nothing.

11:53.760 --> 11:54.886
Stop right there!

11:57.013 --> 11:59.766
They're heading for the vault elevator.
Hit the kill-switch!

12:00.642 --> 12:02.185
It's not working!

12:13.947 --> 12:16.115
<i>Spider-Man</i>

12:17.617 --> 12:18.701
<i>Spider-Man</i>

12:18.868 --> 12:20.745
It's catchy.

12:21.329 --> 12:24.415
The dry cleaner had a contract
to launder Federal Reserve uniforms.

12:24.582 --> 12:27.335
By busting in through the bank,
the thieves set us on the wrong path.

12:27.502 --> 12:28.920
Gave them time to make their move.

12:29.087 --> 12:31.172
Treasury Department's brought
in a Mobile Command Centre.

12:31.339 --> 12:32.799
You two will be safe inside.

12:33.466 --> 12:36.886
If you don't mind, I'd like to snap
some pics for the <i>Bugle.</i>

12:37.053 --> 12:41.474
And I could get some good shots
from behind that van.

12:41.641 --> 12:43.935
Be careful. And stay out of sight.

12:44.102 --> 12:46.604
Thanks! I thought we'd be stuck
with him all night.

12:48.398 --> 12:50.149
I said I'd take some pics.

12:50.316 --> 12:51.859
Didn't say that was all I'd do.

12:53.236 --> 12:55.530
Now, there's a pretty sight.

12:56.239 --> 12:59.284
A billion dollars' worth of gold.

13:08.001 --> 13:10.336
And we're trapped inside with it.

13:10.795 --> 13:12.171
Three perps did this?

13:12.338 --> 13:15.466
Excuse me. But I have a pretty
good idea who those perps are.

13:26.019 --> 13:29.731
As promised.
Our chariot awaits.

13:31.107 --> 13:34.193
Perps were tough but dumb.
They destroyed the elevator.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.155
The vault is 86 feet below sea level.
They're trapped.

13:37.322 --> 13:39.657
It'll take days,
maybe weeks to reach them.

13:39.824 --> 13:42.327
Shocker's a pro.
He wouldn't have acted without a plan.

13:42.493 --> 13:44.537
Which means if I don't get
down there fast...

13:44.704 --> 13:46.622
...you'll be left with
a big empty vault.

13:46.789 --> 13:49.500
- Wait, you can't--
- It's okay. He's on our side.

13:56.466 --> 14:01.220
Come on, let's show our guest
a little down home hospitality.

14:01.387 --> 14:03.931
Ox, give old Ricochet a boost.

14:08.269 --> 14:10.688
I'll give him a ride.

14:22.950 --> 14:26.120
Oh, great. I get to play
follow-the-bouncing-bad-guy.

14:32.835 --> 14:34.545
Really got to get me...

14:34.712 --> 14:38.216
...one of those shock-absorbing suits.

14:38.383 --> 14:40.093
But until then...

14:41.094 --> 14:43.679
I'll just make do with what I've got.

14:53.815 --> 14:54.857
Exit door's open.

14:57.527 --> 14:59.904
Load her up.
We'll squash the bug.

15:00.071 --> 15:02.573
Squash the bug.
Squash the bug.

15:02.740 --> 15:04.200
Don't you know any other tunes?

15:12.291 --> 15:14.544
- Skedaddle.
- But there's still so much gold.

15:14.710 --> 15:18.464
Can't risk it. Listen, you wanna
tell the Big Man we lost his take?

15:18.631 --> 15:20.425
No, thank you.

15:32.645 --> 15:34.939
Most expensive bruises
I've ever gotten.

15:35.606 --> 15:36.649
Pardon me, boys!

15:45.992 --> 15:48.244
What a revolting development this is.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.918
Bug.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.501
Get him.

16:47.220 --> 16:50.139
Don't let go, Ox.
He is a slippery little piece of meat.

16:50.306 --> 16:52.808
So tenderise him.

16:54.977 --> 16:59.065
- More?
- No, no more.

16:59.232 --> 17:02.485
Just get it over with, Shocker.
Make it quick.

17:05.029 --> 17:09.700
Never did like to see
a poor dumb animal suffer.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.161
Like, say, Brer Rabbit?

17:18.626 --> 17:21.170
Never touch another man's treasure!

17:22.213 --> 17:24.589
One man's treasure
is another man's brake pads.

17:50.866 --> 17:53.911
Now, if I wanted you to get away
with the gold...

17:58.124 --> 18:01.419
Watch it, you big Ox!

18:02.837 --> 18:05.089
So we just sit here all night?

18:05.256 --> 18:09.010
I mean, some of us have a life,
you know. No of fence.

18:14.557 --> 18:17.977
Saddle up. We're riding out of
this concrete-box canyon.

18:33.576 --> 18:37.455
Is that the geek's camera?
Peter!

18:47.006 --> 18:50.217
Next time, bug.
Go!

18:55.556 --> 18:58.601
You know, they just don't make
getaway cars like they used to.

19:24.835 --> 19:26.587
There's no body, Sally.

19:26.754 --> 19:28.756
- Peter--
- Was blown to bits!

19:28.923 --> 19:32.718
Oh, great, what will I tell Liz?
She looks awful in black.

19:34.637 --> 19:38.307
- Did I miss much?
- Peter!

19:39.433 --> 19:41.394
Wait!
How come you're still alive?

19:42.478 --> 19:45.981
- I took a bathroom break?
- But your camera...

19:47.316 --> 19:49.068
Man, my new camera!

19:49.735 --> 19:51.529
I suppose you left it on auto-shoot...

19:51.696 --> 19:55.157
...to try to get a few pictures
while indisposed.

19:57.076 --> 19:58.452
Yeah. Exactly.

19:58.619 --> 20:00.621
Do you know
what you put me through?

20:00.788 --> 20:04.458
- I didn't realise you cared.
- I so don't!

20:04.625 --> 20:08.379
But I don't want you blown
to bits, either. I'm not a monster!

20:08.546 --> 20:13.509
But if you tell anyone I hugged you,
you'll wish you were behind that van.

20:14.218 --> 20:16.178
Enlightening field trip, sir.

20:17.179 --> 20:18.681
Really.

20:21.392 --> 20:23.978
I'm sorry, coach. I had no choice.

20:24.437 --> 20:27.356
I had to report Harry Osborn's actions
to the N-Y-S-H-S-F-F.

20:29.024 --> 20:30.192
Yeah, the "Nyshsff."

20:30.359 --> 20:34.071
The Mustangs' championship title
is now under review.

20:41.746 --> 20:45.207
Nice, Osborn.
Bad enough you juiced.

20:45.374 --> 20:49.295
- You had to spill and ruin it for--
- He didn't spill. I did.

20:51.714 --> 20:54.133
Title is meaningless
if it's not won fair and square.

21:00.306 --> 21:02.391
Thanks.

21:03.726 --> 21:07.062
You did good.
They'll see that...eventually.

21:08.230 --> 21:11.025
In the meantime,
you want to grab a coffee?
