00:02.169 --> 00:03.034
<i>Previously on "the catch"...
Tommy.</i>

00:03.136 --> 00:04.346
He really is my brother.
You okay?

00:04.371 --> 00:05.737
Actually, I could use your help.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.772
The overseas account
was opened in tommy's name.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.074
By his former employers.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.375
I used to walk their dogs.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.943
Hello? Mr. And mrs. Kincaid?

00:13.046 --> 00:15.280
Benjamin jones,
agent justine diaz.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.948
What would you say if I told you

00:17.050 --> 00:18.817
I could get you
out of here tomorrow?

00:18.886 --> 00:21.620
Setting up cons, pulling jobs,
but looping me in.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.922
So that I can collect evidence,
make arrests.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.991
He accepted the deal?
Without consulting me?

00:26.093 --> 00:27.158
It's only 18 months.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.493
Margot just became the head.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.740
Of one of the most powerful
crime families in the world.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.342
She's got bigger problems
than you right now.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.577
Our assets are under attack.
Our people are disappearing.

00:34.601 --> 00:37.502
Whatever this turns out to be,
you'll handle it.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.772
Good morning, ladies.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.507
I find myself suddenly in need.

00:42.609 --> 00:45.810
Of a private investigation
and security firm.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.016
I have a business proposition
for you.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.088
For god's sake,
put the guns away, ladies.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.623
I am unarmed.

00:58.692 --> 01:02.027
<i>No, scratch that... I am armed.</i>

01:02.129 --> 01:04.563
But only because someone
is trying to kill me.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.465
Really, just one person?
And it's not me or alice?

01:07.501 --> 01:10.335
A sniper just shot my left
lieutenant jamison.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.804
In the head
right in front of me.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.773
I want you to find out who.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.409
You want to hire us?

01:17.477 --> 01:19.177
You are still
a private investigation.

01:19.279 --> 01:20.356
And security firm, are you not?

01:20.380 --> 01:21.513
No thanks to you.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.952
I am aware of the irony
of this situation.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.554
I tried to put you out
of business,

01:29.656 --> 01:31.189
And now I am asking you.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.992
To find out
who's trying to kill me.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.794
And why would we ever do that?

01:35.896 --> 01:39.464
Because you need clients
and cash.

01:39.566 --> 01:40.999
Which I can supply...

01:41.068 --> 01:44.302
Half a million dollars...
Real, not counterfeit.

01:44.404 --> 01:45.604
You can check.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.112
And there'll be another
just like it.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.707
When you've caught
whoever's doing this.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.611
So, shall we discuss?

01:55.616 --> 01:58.650
<font color="#ffff00">Captions by vitac</font>...

01:59.720 --> 02:02.787
<i>We are not working
for margot bishop, are we?</i>

02:02.856 --> 02:04.789
We can't. I don't know.

02:04.891 --> 02:08.425
With this much money we could
rehire the entire staff,

02:08.527 --> 02:09.860
Get the security team back...

02:09.930 --> 02:11.262
It's a con. She's playing us.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.797
She has no reason to play us.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.232
She's already won.

02:14.334 --> 02:17.469
So, this what we're doing now?
We're working for criminals?

02:17.571 --> 02:18.703
I don't know about you guys,

02:18.772 --> 02:21.373
But I won't feel safe unless
I know where margot is.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.275
And what she's doing every
second of the day and night,

02:24.344 --> 02:26.611
Which is what
she's paying us to do.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.146
Will you tell her about ben?

02:28.248 --> 02:30.415
That he's out of jail
and working for the fbi?

02:30.517 --> 02:31.794
You gonna tell him about margot?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.818
If I do, he'll tell me
not to take the case,

02:33.920 --> 02:36.021
He'll threaten margot,
she'll try to kill him.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.555
So you're not gonna tell him?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.461
Val and sophie and I
can handle margot.

02:43.563 --> 02:44.863
You can stay focused on tommy.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.297
You don't have to get involved.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.400
I'm already involved,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.267
And I'm not taking my eyes
off that woman.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.513
That's the whole point of this.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.470
But thank you.

02:52.572 --> 02:53.872
Where are we on tommy's case?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.507
What do we know
about the kincaids?

02:55.609 --> 02:57.108
Only that they're not
the kincaids.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.110
Jimmy and cathy kincaid
are aliases.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.945
That only go back eight months.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.380
Any leads
on who they really are?

03:02.482 --> 03:04.249
We're running their faces
through the qr-20,

03:04.351 --> 03:05.183
But no matches so far.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.484
Maybe tommy can help.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.186
I tried him.
He's not picking up.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.521
He better pick up.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.691
Vaughan residence,
tommy speaking.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.926
Did I wake you? No,

03:15.028 --> 03:17.796
But that's only because
your boyfriend already did.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.497
Fiance, thank you very much.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.000
Seriously, who grinds coffee
beans before 7:00 a.M.?

03:22.102 --> 03:23.868
So, ben is there with you?

03:23.970 --> 03:26.137
Yep. He's looking very fit.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.038
You want to say hi?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.740
I would, actually.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.508
You leave for work
way too early.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.377
What are you still doing there?

03:32.479 --> 03:34.412
You're undercover.
We're supposed to be discreet.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.981
We will be the minute I get
my first assignment.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.150
Listen, I-i have to
tell you something.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.252
I have a new client.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.597
There's a lot
you have to tell me.

03:41.621 --> 03:42.887
According to tommy,

03:42.989 --> 03:44.434
You were quite the little
cheerleader in high school.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.557
Head cheerleader...

03:45.625 --> 03:47.959
At least she was before
she got herself suspended.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.128
Can you put my brother
back on the phone, please?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.429
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:51.531 --> 03:52.464
What did you get suspended for?

03:52.532 --> 03:53.572
Just put him on the phone.

03:53.633 --> 03:54.499
I'll tell you later.

03:54.601 --> 03:55.633
Thank you.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.935
Tommy, no, you won't.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.781
I need you in the office.
We have questions for you.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.538
Well, is this
about the kincaids?

04:00.640 --> 04:03.475
Do not mention the kincaids or
the money to anyone, even ben.

04:03.543 --> 04:05.043
But... do you understand?

04:05.112 --> 04:06.289
Are you this bossy
with all your clients?

04:06.313 --> 04:08.313
She is, actually. I heard that.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.714
Put ben back on the phone.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.783
Good luck.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.551
What is he not supposed
to tell me?

04:13.653 --> 04:15.420
I don't want him talking
about his case,

04:15.522 --> 04:17.622
And I don't want you
talking about your new job.

04:17.724 --> 04:18.623
Or any of your old jobs.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.036
Well, then,
I guess we're gonna have.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.303
To go back to talking about you.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.861
I'm coming over there.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.763
No, I'm late for work.
Got to go. Bye.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.701
The suspect's name
is kenji yoshida.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.170
He is the chef
at the restaurant vinzu.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.272
Vinzu. Ooh. Impossible to get
a table at vinzu.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.174
I've been there several times.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.942
And why don't we like kenji?

04:38.044 --> 04:40.044
Our informant tells us
that mr. Yoshida.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.147
Is his source
for high-end contraband.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.548
Meaning? It could be anything...

04:43.650 --> 04:45.817
Fine cigars, pharmaceuticals...

04:45.919 --> 04:47.352
Shall I make us a reservation?

04:47.454 --> 04:48.987
This mission is recon only.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.623
You'll be going in after hours
to place cameras.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.992
So, when the footage just
happens to land on your desk...

04:54.094 --> 04:55.760
The judge will give me
my warrant.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.663
So, we go in as...

04:58.765 --> 05:00.098
Property managers.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.366
Public health inspectors.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.334
A film crew scouting
for locations.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.870
You'll be going in as...

05:05.972 --> 05:07.105
Exterminators.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.257
You had me there for a second!
I like her. She's funny!

05:14.281 --> 05:16.247
The bureau will provide you
with uniforms,

05:16.349 --> 05:17.727
Spray cans,
whatever else you may need.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.928
You guys don't have to do that.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.196
No, no...
W-we'll do it all ourselves.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.497
We'll come up
with our own cover.

05:21.521 --> 05:22.732
Yeah, we have our own equipment.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.100
You'll pay for it, obviously,
but...

05:24.124 --> 05:25.557
I get it. You guys are pros.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.659
Independent contractors.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.959
Artisans, really.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.694
The best con men
in the business.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.262
Which is why I can't trust you.

05:31.331 --> 05:35.166
<i>I mean, would you trust you
if you were in my position?</i>

05:35.268 --> 05:38.002
Which is why we're doing
things my way.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.805
Or go back to prison.
It's your choice.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.710
Wait, the kincaids
are not the kincaids?

05:45.812 --> 05:47.178
We need you to think back.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.547
Did they ever call each other
by different names,

05:49.649 --> 05:51.349
Or have pet names
for each other?

05:51.384 --> 05:53.685
I don't know.
Or did they ever have visitors?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.486
Did you meet any
of their friends?

05:55.589 --> 05:56.688
I don't think so.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.067
When was the last time
you saw them?

05:58.091 --> 06:01.659
Okay... that was on a... Year.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.094
I, - I don't know.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.196
Two people are dead, tommy.
You could be next.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.431
Yeah, I get that.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.366
<i>Okay, then think.
Give me something.</i>

06:08.468 --> 06:10.869
When was the last time
you saw them?

06:10.937 --> 06:13.605
Um, what happened to their dogs?

06:13.707 --> 06:16.241
The police have the dogs.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.676
Good, because, you know,
they're both chipped.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.546
We didn't even think of that.

06:21.648 --> 06:24.015
The chips'll lead us to
whoever registered the dogs.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.352
And that might give you
the kincaids' real names.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.621
Yes. Thank you. I got it.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:40.400 --> 06:42.667
From the trajectory
of the bullet,

06:42.736 --> 06:44.347
It looks like the shooter
was positioned on the roof.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.503
Of the wiltshire building.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.740
Allie, take a look.
There's no apparent markings.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.575
It's not like any bullet
I've ever seen.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.443
You've seen a lot of bullets,
have you?

06:52.545 --> 06:54.412
She spent seven years
with the l.A.P.D.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.848
Really? Why'd you leave?

06:58.785 --> 07:01.052
It looks custom.
I'll get it to the lab.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.465
I don't think
they'll find anything.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.755
The shooter was a pro.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.524
Then how did he miss?
Unless jamison was the target.

07:06.626 --> 07:09.928
Jamison and I switched positions
rather suddenly...

07:09.996 --> 07:11.229
Bless him.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.131
We'll need a list of suspects,

07:13.233 --> 07:15.333
An enemies list,

07:15.435 --> 07:18.036
Present company excluded,
of course.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.539
You can start with my three
missing lieutenants.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.390
If I were to write a list of
everyone who wants me dead,

07:27.414 --> 07:28.414
We'll be here all day.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.415
<i>You will be here all day.</i>

07:30.517 --> 07:31.716
We'll get you a new room,

07:31.818 --> 07:33.863
But you're not going anywhere
until we catch the shooter.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.120
So, no room service,
no phone calls, no internet,

07:36.222 --> 07:37.522
We'll get you
a new burner phone,

07:37.624 --> 07:40.024
<i>And a laptop
with our security protocols.</i>

07:40.093 --> 07:42.393
Which means no contact with
anyone except from our team.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.895
You get hungry, we'll feed you.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.364
You get thirsty,
we will refill the mini-bar.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.901
You get bored or lonely
or stir-crazy...

07:51.304 --> 07:54.238
Too bad. We're in charge now.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.075
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

07:57.177 --> 08:00.078
More than I thought I would.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.930
Hey! Hey!

08:10.999 --> 08:12.699
Sophie tells me we may need.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.034
To get you your own desk
at the office.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.703
Nice work with the dogs today.

08:16.805 --> 08:18.037
Thank you.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.372
And I don't like to brag,

08:19.474 --> 08:22.208
But I also set a mean table,
as well.

08:22.277 --> 08:23.509
Four place settings?

08:23.578 --> 08:24.911
Guess who's coming to dinner?

08:24.946 --> 08:27.413
Don't be mad at tommy.

08:27.515 --> 08:29.382
This whole thing
was all my idea.

08:29.484 --> 08:32.118
What whole thing? Dinner! Hey.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.885
Well, not yet. Nearly.

08:37.424 --> 08:40.058
Rhys?

08:40.160 --> 08:41.394
You brought rhys over here?

08:41.496 --> 08:42.996
Well, I couldn't
leave him alone.

08:43.097 --> 08:44.731
He's like a puppy.
He gets into things.

08:44.766 --> 08:46.846
Which is why he can't be here,
and you can't be here.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.434
The fbi was very clear
about that.

08:48.536 --> 08:50.570
You are undercover now.
But I'm not undercover.

08:50.639 --> 08:51.738
Agent diaz has me sneaking.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.473
Around tomorrow night
in a... Costume.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.741
What kind of costume?

08:54.809 --> 08:56.487
<i>I can't even talk about it.
How was your day?</i>

08:56.511 --> 08:57.551
Didn't you have something.

08:57.612 --> 08:59.023
To tell me this morning,
a new client at work?

08:59.047 --> 09:00.313
Don't change the subject.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.482
<i>This little dinner-party thing
can't happen.</i>

09:02.584 --> 09:03.584
Why not?

09:03.618 --> 09:04.817
This is my last free night,

09:04.919 --> 09:07.064
And I don't know how long your
brother's gonna be in town.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.421
I would like to get to know him.

09:08.490 --> 09:11.090
Allie, the only reason
I took this fbi deal.

09:11.192 --> 09:13.426
Was that you and I
could be together.

09:13.528 --> 09:16.062
By the end of it
like a normal couple.

09:16.097 --> 09:20.767
So can't we, for one night,
pretend that we are?

09:20.869 --> 09:23.670
You'd think they'd notice if we
skipped the salad and just...

09:23.738 --> 09:25.538
If you don't mind them
being alone together...

09:25.640 --> 09:26.951
God,
we should get back out there.

09:26.975 --> 09:28.285
No, no, no.
It's all right, it's all right.

09:28.309 --> 09:30.677
Don't worry.
I've got rhys on a short leash.

09:30.745 --> 09:32.245
He's on his best
behavior tonight.

09:32.347 --> 09:34.914
<i>And that was the first time
I killed a man.</i>

09:35.016 --> 09:36.949
<i>Whoa. That was the first time?</i>

09:37.052 --> 09:38.584
Okay, I think
we've had enough wine.

09:38.687 --> 09:40.053
So, there were other times?

09:40.155 --> 09:41.487
God, yeah.

09:41.523 --> 09:43.567
I mean, there are so many
terrible people in this world.

09:43.591 --> 09:45.625
Yes, there are.

09:45.694 --> 09:47.093
Yeah, no... look, you know what,

09:47.195 --> 09:50.563
That was a sordid chapter
in my life.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.432
Yeah. It was a terrible time,

09:52.500 --> 09:54.033
And thank god it's over...

09:54.102 --> 09:56.302
<i>Because, I'll tell you
something, crime does not pay.</i>

09:56.371 --> 09:57.548
I think we can all agree
on that.

09:57.572 --> 09:59.150
You don't want to end up
in the chokey like benji.

09:59.174 --> 10:00.406
You know what?

10:00.508 --> 10:02.241
You were in prison? What for?

10:02.310 --> 10:03.176
It's a funny story.

10:03.244 --> 10:04.244
Tommy, it's not polite.

10:04.345 --> 10:05.890
To ask people what they went
to prison for.

10:05.914 --> 10:07.447
They had him up on all sorts.

10:07.515 --> 10:09.449
Theft, fraud, conspiracy.

10:09.517 --> 10:10.695
How... how...
How did you get out?

10:10.719 --> 10:12.051
Um... Technicality.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.486
He made a deal.

10:13.555 --> 10:14.854
You know what, enough about us.

10:14.956 --> 10:15.755
Let's hear about you.

10:15.857 --> 10:17.190
Yeah, thomas.

10:17.292 --> 10:18.424
What brings you to town?

10:18.526 --> 10:20.059
Well, actually, I was...

10:20.095 --> 10:21.572
Tommy's in between jobs
at the moment,

10:21.596 --> 10:23.641
And I'm trying to convince him,
stay in l.A. And work for me.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.398
You are? You are?-

10:25.500 --> 10:26.632
So, you two are close, then?

10:26.735 --> 10:28.701
Yeah, you know, I mean...

10:28.770 --> 10:30.803
I mean, we don't get
to see each other very...

10:30.872 --> 10:32.438
Nearly as much
as we'd like to, but.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.051
We'd like to, but... yeah. We've
been through a lot together.

10:34.075 --> 10:35.541
That's sweet. You know what,

10:35.610 --> 10:38.444
<i>That almost makes me
miss my big sister.</i>

10:38.580 --> 10:40.580
Although alice will tell you
what a vicious,

10:40.648 --> 10:43.316
<i>Little sour-faced
wrecking ball she is.</i>

10:46.321 --> 10:47.854
More wine, anyone?

10:49.958 --> 10:52.492
Thank god!

10:52.594 --> 10:54.327
New phone, new laptop.

10:54.429 --> 10:55.795
Yeah. Fine.

10:55.897 --> 10:57.797
Where is it?

10:57.899 --> 11:00.333
There you are.

11:00.435 --> 11:02.135
This is agent melissa trumbull.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.402
What took you so long?

11:03.505 --> 11:05.671
For the next 12 hours,
you need anything,

11:05.740 --> 11:07.006
She'll take care of you.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.108
What, you're just gonna
leave her here?

11:09.210 --> 11:10.443
She's your bodywoman.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.146
So now that you and
alice vaughan have my money,

11:13.214 --> 11:15.281
You're just gonna go off
and spend it.

11:15.316 --> 11:18.084
And leave this amazonian spy
to report my every move?

11:18.186 --> 11:19.485
No, thanks.

11:19.521 --> 11:22.288
You're dismissed,
agent whatever-your-name-is.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.657
You're the client.

11:24.759 --> 11:27.827
But those three lieutenants
of yours.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.196
That you thought were trying
to kill you...

11:30.298 --> 11:32.665
They're dead,

11:32.767 --> 11:35.535
Shot in the head
just like jamison.

11:41.943 --> 11:44.410
Fine. She stays.

11:44.512 --> 11:45.778
But outside, in the hall.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.715
I'll call with a ballistics
report on that sniper bullet.

11:49.818 --> 11:52.952
Until then, try not
to make any new enemies.

12:07.402 --> 12:10.937
Hey, so, are you staying late,

12:11.039 --> 12:14.640
Or, do you want to maybe
go get a drink or something?

12:14.676 --> 12:16.042
Yeah.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.376
Just give me 20 minutes?

12:17.445 --> 12:18.845
Why? What are you working on?

12:18.913 --> 12:21.080
Show me.

12:26.688 --> 12:27.854
What are you doing? Look...

12:27.956 --> 12:29.555
You're supposed
to be investigating.

12:29.657 --> 12:31.257
The kincaids, not tommy.

12:31.326 --> 12:32.525
I know you like him.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.627
I like him, too...

12:33.695 --> 12:35.394
Is there anyone that you trust?

12:35.496 --> 12:37.129
No.

12:37.198 --> 12:38.898
But that doesn't mean...

12:39.000 --> 12:40.499
<i>Did you run
a background check on me?</i>

12:41.836 --> 12:44.036
I can't believe you.
It's my job.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.905
The minute that anyone
walks in that door,

12:45.974 --> 12:47.051
It is in our best interest...

12:47.075 --> 12:48.219
Okay, well, I'm walking
out that door,

12:48.243 --> 12:49.809
So you can either come with me,

12:49.911 --> 12:52.311
<i>And I can try and prove to you
that there are people.</i>

12:52.413 --> 12:53.479
You can actually trust,

12:53.581 --> 12:56.983
Or you can stay here
and keep doing that.

12:57.018 --> 12:58.618
Just give me 5 more minutes.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.487
Take all the time you need.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.596
Okay.

13:10.665 --> 13:14.667
So, I probably shouldn't have
invited rhys over tonight.

13:14.736 --> 13:17.103
You think?

13:17.205 --> 13:19.038
I'm trying to apologize.

13:19.107 --> 13:22.275
And if it's any consolation,

13:22.377 --> 13:25.511
I think that tommy had
a really good time tonight.

13:25.580 --> 13:26.712
Of course he did.

13:26.814 --> 13:29.015
He loved you.
That's the problem.

13:29.117 --> 13:32.785
He's very impressionable,
and you and rhys are not...

13:32.854 --> 13:34.420
Not what?

13:34.522 --> 13:36.355
The best role models.

13:38.259 --> 13:40.104
You don't want me to spend time
with your brother.

13:40.128 --> 13:42.028
No, it's not that, it's just...

13:42.130 --> 13:43.429
I'm a bad influence.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.932
Sweetie...

13:46.034 --> 13:48.167
You're a criminal.

13:48.269 --> 13:50.670
<i>I was a criminal.</i>

13:50.772 --> 13:52.505
Am I not now one
of the good guys?

13:52.607 --> 13:53.873
Do I not work for the fbi?

13:53.975 --> 13:55.135
Can you keep your voice down?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.442
My brother's in the next room.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.744
Your brother is not the problem.
You are.

13:58.846 --> 14:00.680
You still don't trust me.

14:00.782 --> 14:01.992
That is not what this is about.

14:02.016 --> 14:04.083
How long is this gonna take,
5 years, 10?

14:04.152 --> 14:06.485
What do I have to do?
I just went to jail for you.

14:06.587 --> 14:09.655
For 72 hours, and then you made
a deal without consulting me.

14:09.757 --> 14:11.324
I was in prison without a phone.

14:11.426 --> 14:12.692
How am I supposed to tell you?

14:12.760 --> 14:15.728
So, I'm just supposed to get
over it and decide to trust you?

14:15.830 --> 14:17.897
Yes!

14:17.999 --> 14:19.365
<i>I trust you.</i>

14:19.467 --> 14:21.233
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

14:21.269 --> 14:22.501
<i>What is that mean?</i>

14:22.603 --> 14:25.104
It means that we've only
known each other for a year,

14:25.173 --> 14:27.840
And one of us was lying to
the other one the entire time.

14:27.942 --> 14:29.842
Are you honestly gonna throw
that in my face.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.177
Every time we have a fight?

14:31.245 --> 14:34.046
I don't know!
You know, maybe, and I get to.

14:34.148 --> 14:35.214
You know why?

14:35.283 --> 14:37.917
Because you lied to me
for an entire year.

14:38.019 --> 14:39.259
What if I had done that to you?

14:39.320 --> 14:42.455
<i>I would understand
that you had no choice,</i>

14:42.557 --> 14:44.123
And I would forgive you.

14:44.192 --> 14:45.192
<i>I have forgiven you!</i>

14:45.259 --> 14:47.059
<i>You're just never gonna
let me forget.</i>

14:47.161 --> 14:48.928
That you've forgiven me.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.099
What are you doing?

14:52.133 --> 14:54.100
<i>I am leaving.</i>

14:54.202 --> 14:56.736
You were right... I shouldn't
have come over here tonight.

14:56.838 --> 14:58.838
Babe!

14:58.906 --> 15:01.340
Babe!

15:01.442 --> 15:02.942
It's late! Don't leave.

15:03.044 --> 15:04.521
You're gonna wake up your
brother, and, you know,

15:04.545 --> 15:06.323
I wouldn't want to corrupt him
any more than I already have.

15:06.347 --> 15:09.648
It's not you, it's him.

15:09.751 --> 15:12.418
He is a 35-year-old man
who has never had a job.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.053
His life is a complete disaster,

15:14.122 --> 15:15.755
And I can't have him
looking at you.

15:15.857 --> 15:18.057
And your life and thinking
that that's an option,

15:18.159 --> 15:20.159
Because he wouldn't last
a second in your world.

15:20.261 --> 15:21.261
He's not you.

15:22.930 --> 15:25.398
I'm trying to apologize.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.466
So you don't trust him, either.

15:27.568 --> 15:29.635
No, of course not.

15:31.039 --> 15:32.471
Wow.

15:32.573 --> 15:34.340
Tommy, it's not what I meant.

15:34.442 --> 15:36.409
No, no, no... I think.

15:36.511 --> 15:37.688
It's pretty much
exactly what you mean.

15:37.712 --> 15:38.778
Tommy, I was just leaving.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.290
No. Come on. Tommy, wait.
You guys talk.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.658
I'll call you later.
Don't go. Please...

15:41.682 --> 15:42.682
Ben.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.818
Good morning.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.186
What are you doing here?

15:55.255 --> 15:56.654
Val said you were disappointed

15:56.723 --> 15:58.656
I wasn't giving you enough
personal attention,

15:58.758 --> 16:00.091
So I sent agent trumbull home.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.392
When?

16:01.461 --> 16:02.894
Around 6:00?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.963
Couldn't sleep?

16:05.065 --> 16:06.631
Guilty conscious?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.934
What do I have to feel
guilty about?

16:10.036 --> 16:13.871
<i>Does ben know about me,
about us?</i>

16:13.974 --> 16:16.140
There's coffee on the table.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.977
Let me ask you something.

16:19.079 --> 16:22.347
You don't trust me, do you?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.048
Did you put something in this?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.550
No.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.720
I'm just saying...
You and I working together...

16:28.822 --> 16:31.222
We're moving on with our...

16:31.324 --> 16:33.391
Relationship,

16:33.493 --> 16:35.793
But you're never
going to trust me.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.695
No.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.063
That would make me an idiot.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.866
And I'm never going
to trust you.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.267
Nor should you.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.969
But who's asking you to?

16:47.374 --> 16:50.241
You might want to get dressed.
We have work to do.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.210
Hello. Hey. You on your way in?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.045
Actually, I am at margot's.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.147
What?!

16:56.416 --> 16:57.560
Ben and I had a fight
last night.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.218
I couldn't sleep,
so I let melissa go home.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.919
You're alone with margot bishop?

17:01.988 --> 17:03.087
What? Is she okay?

17:03.189 --> 17:05.356
It's fine. We are fine.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.859
<i>So, you're fighting with ben,
but you and margot are fine.</i>

17:08.928 --> 17:10.762
Yep. What's going on there?

17:10.864 --> 17:12.096
I'm putting you on speaker.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.565
Did we find the kincaids' dogs?
We did.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.835
They're both registered to
someone named patrick murphy.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.837
At an l.A. Address
that doesn't exist.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.339
So, the kincaids
were the murphys.

17:21.407 --> 17:22.306
Tommy's intel was good.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.409
Who's tommy?

17:23.443 --> 17:24.842
I have to go.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.711
I thought I was
your only client.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.680
Tommy's my little brother.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.516
Another thing we have in common.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.584
As you know,
I have one of those, too.

17:33.687 --> 17:36.187
How do I look?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.189
Justine had them sent over.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.357
There's one for you, too.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.858
Take that off right now.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.194
Benji,
I thought you'd never ask.

17:44.698 --> 17:45.930
This is ridiculous.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.899
The only reason
the fbi recruited us...

17:47.967 --> 17:49.333
<i>Recruited you.</i>

17:49.436 --> 17:51.969
<i>Is because we are
the very best at what we do,</i>

17:52.072 --> 17:53.504
And we didn't get to be that way.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.139
By taking orders
from other people.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.507
Well, margot...

17:56.609 --> 17:57.942
We don't need margot.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.889
If justine wants us to take down
this smuggling ring...

17:59.913 --> 18:01.646
Which she emphatically does not.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.049
She will, so we might as well do
it the only way we know how.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.584
Not as bug people.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.387
Not as bug people.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.192
I'll use your contacts
to get a reservation.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.893
Good afternoon.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.196
And then I'll arrange a meeting
with kenji,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.832
But not as benjamin jones.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.701
Excuse me, the gentleman
that just walked in...

18:23.803 --> 18:25.837
Is that william sayles?

18:25.939 --> 18:27.271
The food critic? Yeah.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.674
Is it?
No one's ever seen a photo.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.309
It is him.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.744
Usually he's in disguise,

18:32.846 --> 18:35.046
But I saw him once at a bistro
in paris,

18:35.148 --> 18:38.316
Which he then gave a rather
nasty review.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.718
Will you excuse me? Sure.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.640
I'm sorry.
I know I shouldn't say anything,

19:35.742 --> 19:37.608
But I know who you are.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.911
Well...

19:40.013 --> 19:43.381
I realize it's inappropriate,
but, I have to know.

19:43.449 --> 19:46.417
Are you enjoying
the razor clams?

19:46.452 --> 19:49.987
The only way I could
enjoy them more, chef...

19:51.090 --> 19:53.224
Is if you'd join me.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.459
Hai.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.508
Hey. Hey.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.910
Where is everybody?
Where's, allie?

20:13.012 --> 20:15.947
She's... Out on a case.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.081
My case?

20:17.183 --> 20:18.316
No, actually.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.917
But I'm sure
she'll be back soon.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.986
Can I, um...

20:23.489 --> 20:25.990
Has... has allie given up on me?

20:26.059 --> 20:27.458
No, of course not.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.460
A-actually, you were right
about the dogs.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.662
It turns out
they were registered.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.564
Under the name patrick murphy,

20:33.633 --> 20:36.200
So jimmy kincaid
was patrick murphy.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.536
That makes sense,
because the kincaids.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.372
Used to get patrick murphy's
mail all the time,

20:41.441 --> 20:44.208
But they said that he was
the previous tenant.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.310
Wait a second.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.249
My god, is that...
That's a crime scene.

20:51.351 --> 20:55.253
<i>It is, and that is a pile
of unopened mail left there.</i>

20:55.321 --> 20:58.055
Maybe some of them are addressed
to patrick murphy.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.290
So?

20:59.392 --> 21:01.626
So, I think you just
gave us another clue.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.967
Your brother?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.669
Ballistics report
on our shooter.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.837
Did they find anything?

21:12.939 --> 21:13.939
No.

21:14.007 --> 21:16.540
No signature from the weapon,

21:16.643 --> 21:18.776
Bullet was hand-made
"with a hand-lathed.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.211
Nickle-tungsten
penetrator tip"...

21:20.313 --> 21:22.546
With a cast-copper casing.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.215
Yes.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.419
You okay?

21:28.521 --> 21:29.987
No.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.024
I'm a dead woman.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.558
He's called "the hammer."

21:34.661 --> 21:38.229
He makes his own weapons
and his own bullets.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.563
Totally untraceable...

21:39.632 --> 21:42.366
Nobody knows what he looks like
or what his real name is.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.501
Who does he work for?

21:43.603 --> 21:45.503
He's freelance, apparently...

21:45.605 --> 21:49.307
Never meets in person,
gets paid electronically.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.574
So there's no clue trail.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.011
So, we'll have to lure him out
into the open.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.880
And how do we do that?

21:55.982 --> 21:59.250
By giving him what he wants...

21:59.352 --> 22:01.552
Sending margot bishop back out
into the world.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.898
Are you trying
to get yourself fired?

22:02.922 --> 22:04.099
We are not endangering
the client.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.457
You will be perfectly safe.
I promise.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.328
Because I'll be playing
margot bishop.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.632
I'll be in the line of fire.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.994
Look, I appreciate
you using margot.

22:20.063 --> 22:22.297
To work out your...
Trust issues,

22:22.399 --> 22:24.866
But I am not about to let you
put on a blonde wig.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.402
And a british accent
and take a bullet for her.

22:27.504 --> 22:28.770
I'm not gonna take a bullet.

22:28.839 --> 22:30.883
You and the security team
will be all over the hammer.

22:30.907 --> 22:32.240
Before he gets a shot off.

22:32.342 --> 22:33.475
Did it ever occur to you.

22:33.543 --> 22:35.543
That she may be setting you up
to take this bullet?

22:35.579 --> 22:37.679
She's not setting me up.
She was scared.

22:37.781 --> 22:39.314
Besides, it was my idea.

22:39.383 --> 22:41.883
<i>Or maybe she made
you think it was.</i>

22:43.687 --> 22:46.588
And how's ben gonna feel
about you stopping bullets.

22:46.690 --> 22:47.889
In his ex's pantsuit?

22:47.991 --> 22:49.357
He's not gonna find out,

22:49.426 --> 22:50.737
Because we're gonna
capture the shooter,

22:50.761 --> 22:51.960
Do the job we were paid for,

22:52.062 --> 22:53.862
And then never see
margot bishop again.

22:53.964 --> 22:57.031
Promise? I promise.

22:57.868 --> 22:59.734
We know you said this mission
was recon-only.

22:59.803 --> 23:01.469
You only wanted us
to plant the cameras.

23:01.538 --> 23:03.571
But this is better.
This is so much better.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.973
Kenji loves benji.

23:05.075 --> 23:06.441
And I love kenji.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.210
I know he may be a smuggler,
but his sushi, the kohada.

23:09.312 --> 23:10.845
Ooh, it will change your life.

23:10.914 --> 23:12.747
And not only that,
he's invited benji.

23:12.816 --> 23:14.749
Back to the restaurant
for dinner tonight.

23:14.818 --> 23:17.952
Including an all-access tour,
behind-the-scenes...

23:18.021 --> 23:19.621
So, when we plant the cameras...

23:19.723 --> 23:22.157
Yeah, we won't have to sneak
around like bug people.

23:22.259 --> 23:24.237
We'll have total access.
You won't even need a warrant.

23:24.261 --> 23:25.261
Total access.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.394
What do you think?

23:26.496 --> 23:30.131
I think that...

23:30.233 --> 23:32.667
What I think doesn't matter.

23:32.769 --> 23:35.703
You boys are pros.

23:35.772 --> 23:37.105
You don't need the fbi.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.475
Giving you directives
or resources or backup.

23:40.577 --> 23:42.610
Well... Not necessarily...

23:42.679 --> 23:45.246
Which means, if this goes south
or you blow your cover.

23:45.348 --> 23:47.115
Or if it happens
to get back to kenji.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.883
That the food critic
william sayles.

23:49.019 --> 23:50.218
Is, in fact, a black man...

23:50.287 --> 23:51.519
Wait, is he? What?

23:51.621 --> 23:53.988
You're on your own.
I can't help you.

23:54.090 --> 23:58.960
<i>But you don't need my help,
because you got this, right?</i>

24:01.631 --> 24:03.465
So, jimmy kincaid
was patrick murphy?

24:03.567 --> 24:05.433
That's our working theory.
Thanks to tommy.

24:05.535 --> 24:06.768
But then sophie remembered.

24:06.870 --> 24:09.137
The photos that you guys took
at the kincaids' house...

24:09.239 --> 24:10.505
And we found this.

24:12.609 --> 24:13.842
The optican group.

24:13.944 --> 24:16.578
Another one here and here.

24:16.680 --> 24:17.912
What's the optican group?

24:18.014 --> 24:19.125
We're trying to figure that out.

24:19.149 --> 24:20.048
There's no current listing.

24:20.150 --> 24:21.449
You know, it's probably nothing.

24:21.551 --> 24:22.671
It's not nothing. Thank you.

24:22.719 --> 24:24.519
Okay.

24:24.621 --> 24:26.488
We'll... we'll...
We'll keep looking.

24:38.702 --> 24:40.568
Listen, what you said
last night...

24:40.670 --> 24:41.936
I didn't mean it.

24:42.038 --> 24:43.972
Yeah, you did.

24:48.378 --> 24:50.512
Everything that you said...
It was true.

24:50.580 --> 24:52.580
My life is a disaster.

24:52.682 --> 24:55.316
Never had a real job,
and then...

24:55.385 --> 24:58.586
Do you want one?

24:58.688 --> 24:59.921
Yeah, of course I do.

25:00.023 --> 25:02.624
Then why don't you work here?

25:02.692 --> 25:05.727
I mean, we could use people,
obviously,

25:05.795 --> 25:07.795
And you seem to have
a knack for it.

25:07.898 --> 25:10.798
You don't have to do this,
you know?

25:10.867 --> 25:12.800
Neither do you.

25:14.204 --> 25:17.171
Allie, we may have a thing.

25:17.274 --> 25:19.774
I found a keylogger hidden
on our security network.

25:19.843 --> 25:22.310
That records every keystroke,
log-in, password...

25:22.412 --> 25:23.578
We've been hacked?

25:23.613 --> 25:24.891
I did a sweep when we got
everything back.

25:24.915 --> 25:27.448
From the fbi, but...

25:27.517 --> 25:30.184
This wasn't the fbi.

25:32.889 --> 25:34.856
You and I need to have
a little chat.

25:38.228 --> 25:40.628
What possible reason
would I have.

25:40.730 --> 25:42.196
For stealing your bloody files?

25:42.299 --> 25:43.665
For all I know,
you killed jamison.

25:43.767 --> 25:45.778
To what end? To put me in
front of a sniper's bullet.

25:45.802 --> 25:47.246
Are you seriously gonna make
this about you?

25:47.270 --> 25:49.704
You made this about me
when you ruined my life!

25:49.773 --> 25:51.673
I didn't do that
all by myself, did I?

25:51.775 --> 25:53.486
But you seem to have forgiven
ben for his p...

25:53.510 --> 25:54.976
Ben didn't call the fbi!

25:55.078 --> 25:58.012
<i>I didn't do that to you!
I did it to him.</i>

25:58.114 --> 26:01.516
He lied to me for months,
maybe years.

26:01.618 --> 26:02.517
I'll never know.

26:02.619 --> 26:04.352
He humiliated me.

26:04.454 --> 26:07.422
He broke my heart in exactly
the same way he broke yours.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.390
But, unlike you,
I couldn't forgive him.

26:09.492 --> 26:11.793
So I tried to take away
the one thing he loved most,

26:11.895 --> 26:14.095
More than he ever loved me,
and that was you.

26:15.699 --> 26:19.867
And I'll admit, yes,
I did lie to you earlier.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.402
I do trust you.

26:21.504 --> 26:22.904
I spent a year studying you,

26:23.006 --> 26:24.539
Trying to get inside your head.

26:24.641 --> 26:25.707
I know how good you are.

26:25.809 --> 26:27.709
It's why I hired you.

26:27.811 --> 26:29.444
So, why don't you tell me.

26:29.512 --> 26:32.046
Exactly what it is
you want me to do,

26:32.148 --> 26:33.414
And I will do it.

26:33.516 --> 26:35.416
Anything?

26:35.518 --> 26:37.385
Try me.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.769
What are you doing here?

26:53.804 --> 26:55.871
I heard the kohada
was life-changing.

26:55.940 --> 26:57.873
<i>You said we could do this
our way.</i>

26:57.975 --> 27:00.175
As if I had a choice.
Then why are you here?

27:00.244 --> 27:03.278
To watch and learn, of course.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.214
<i>Do you not want us
to catch this guy?</i>

27:05.282 --> 27:07.115
I wanted you to plant cameras.

27:07.184 --> 27:08.283
Will!

27:08.385 --> 27:10.519
Irasshaimase. How are you?

27:10.588 --> 27:12.020
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.455
Ooh, I see you brought a friend,

27:13.557 --> 27:15.290
And a beautiful friend, indeed.

27:15.359 --> 27:16.825
Yes. Thank you. But..

27:16.927 --> 27:17.993
Yes. We're, um...

27:18.095 --> 27:20.863
Darling. There you are.

27:23.267 --> 27:26.101
Chef yoshida, nigel underhill.

27:26.203 --> 27:28.737
This is my wife, beatrix.

27:30.641 --> 27:33.041
Tonight is our 10th
wedding anniversary,

27:33.143 --> 27:36.311
And we are huge fans,
aren't we, darling?

27:36.413 --> 27:37.479
Yes.

27:37.548 --> 27:39.515
Then you must do me the honor.

27:39.583 --> 27:41.917
Of dining omakase...
Chef's choice.

27:41.986 --> 27:43.585
Well, we...
We couldn't possibly.

27:43.654 --> 27:45.020
No. Come on, bea.

27:45.122 --> 27:48.490
Surely you can give up control
for one night.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.693
I take that as a yes. Please.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.965
So, where do you get the fish,

27:57.067 --> 27:59.134
The tsukiji market
in tokyo, or...

27:59.203 --> 28:02.504
<i>My sources will get to the fish
before it gets to the market.</i>

28:03.841 --> 28:05.407
Sources for things like...

28:07.044 --> 28:08.143
Fugu.

28:08.245 --> 28:10.379
Fugu?

28:10.481 --> 28:12.214
How do you get fugu
into the country?

28:12.316 --> 28:13.382
Shh.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.984
Chef, that stuff can kill you.
The toxins...

28:16.086 --> 28:19.087
It's like a drug
if you prepare it correctly.

28:19.156 --> 28:22.157
Now... I made this just for you.

28:32.202 --> 28:34.570
Keep staring,
you'll blow his cover.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.239
Is that why you showed up,

28:37.341 --> 28:39.408
To make sure we don't succeed
without you?

28:39.476 --> 28:41.209
I am responsible for you two.

28:41.278 --> 28:43.045
You are lucky we are very good.

28:43.113 --> 28:44.246
So you keep telling me.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.448
<i>Why are you here?</i>

28:46.550 --> 28:48.617
Because of what your boss
will say if we fail,

28:48.686 --> 28:51.086
Or is it because you're starting.

28:51.155 --> 28:55.057
To feel about me the way I feel
about the hamachi?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.327
I'm here as backup...

28:58.429 --> 29:00.829
Unnecessary,
but very thoughtful of you.

29:00.931 --> 29:02.598
And to give you these.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.633
What are these?

29:05.970 --> 29:08.136
Are they cameras?
They're adorable.

29:08.205 --> 29:10.138
Wi-fi enabled adhesive back,

29:10.207 --> 29:13.208
And connected to the app I put
on your phone this morning.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.844
And you want me
to get lost on the way.

29:15.946 --> 29:17.746
To the toilet and plant these?

29:17.848 --> 29:20.015
Lucky for me, you're very good.

29:21.452 --> 29:22.951
All right, fine.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.087
Just make sure there's
some hamachi left.

29:25.189 --> 29:26.221
By the time I get back...

29:26.290 --> 29:27.756
Darling.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.994
To everything you have
achieved here, chef.

29:34.198 --> 29:35.430
What?

29:36.667 --> 29:37.867
What's wrong? You can tell me.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.181
My whole life
is keeping secrets.

29:41.205 --> 29:43.105
Most days,

29:43.207 --> 29:46.675
I just want to get back
to my six-seater in osaka.

29:50.214 --> 29:51.947
Why is that?

29:52.016 --> 29:54.383
Because this...

29:54.451 --> 29:57.919
This all belonged
to other people.

29:58.022 --> 30:00.255
Who?

30:02.259 --> 30:04.126
We can't talk here.

30:04.228 --> 30:05.560
Come.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.134
What are you doing?
They're on the move.

30:13.470 --> 30:14.970
He's giving him the tour,
remember?

30:15.072 --> 30:16.750
They're not going anywhere,
and neither are we.

30:16.774 --> 30:19.408
Especially when we can watch
everything from here.

30:30.688 --> 30:32.954
Comfy? Very.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.827
I got involved
with some investors,

30:38.896 --> 30:41.029
Powerful people who are using me.

30:41.098 --> 30:45.167
And this restaurant as a front
for their other interests.

30:45.269 --> 30:46.501
Such as?

30:48.439 --> 30:50.238
You don't have to tell me,
kenji.

30:50.307 --> 30:56.244
Fugu is not the only forbidden
item left off the menu.

31:08.892 --> 31:10.625
I have a plan.

31:10.694 --> 31:13.261
Margot's been holed up in her
suite for the past 48 hours.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.697
It's a good bet the shooter
is staking out the hotel.

31:15.766 --> 31:19.067
She steps outside, he takes
his shot, and we take him.

31:19.136 --> 31:22.070
By dressing you up as margot
and using you as bait?

31:22.172 --> 31:24.306
Not exactly.
I had a talk with margot.

31:24.408 --> 31:26.675
She's willing to put herself
in the cross hairs.

31:26.777 --> 31:28.777
She'll lure the shooter
out into the open,

31:28.879 --> 31:30.212
But the plaza will be crowded,

31:30.280 --> 31:33.014
Making it virtually impossible
for him to get a clean shot.

31:33.117 --> 31:36.051
There are three ideal vantage
points for the shooter.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.386
We will station security agents
at each of them.

31:38.489 --> 31:39.921
Rooftop status report.

31:39.957 --> 31:41.790
Aerial 1 is clear.
Aerial 2 clear.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.759
But if the shooter is as good
as we think he is,

31:43.827 --> 31:45.347
Those agents aren't going
to be enough.

31:45.429 --> 31:46.995
Aerial 3 is clear.

31:53.303 --> 31:54.970
In order to catch the guy,

31:55.072 --> 31:57.239
We're going to have to mess
with him first.

31:59.243 --> 32:01.076
Okay, everyone. On my mark...

32:01.145 --> 32:04.479
In three... Two... One.

32:34.378 --> 32:36.011
How are we doing, alice?

32:36.113 --> 32:37.479
I'm good. Sophie?

32:37.548 --> 32:39.080
Just trying to stay
in the shade.

32:39.183 --> 32:41.283
How about you, val?
I'm still not a fan of this.

32:41.385 --> 32:42.951
Everybody, stay calm.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.754
Rooftop check-in.
Aerial 1, what's your status?

32:45.856 --> 32:48.290
Still clear. Aerial 2 clear.

32:48.358 --> 32:50.225
Aerial 3?

32:51.829 --> 32:53.228
<i>Aerial 3, come in.</i>

32:53.330 --> 32:54.963
Is there a problem?

33:03.073 --> 33:04.806
He's here!
Gansit building to the north.

33:04.842 --> 33:05.842
<i>I'm headed there now.</i>

33:06.844 --> 33:08.076
I'm closer!

33:23.627 --> 33:25.093
He shot at me!

33:31.702 --> 33:34.002
He's picking us off
until he finds her.

33:44.781 --> 33:47.849
I'm here, but he's gone. What?!

33:47.918 --> 33:50.585
His gun's here, but he's not.
I'll find him.

34:30.293 --> 34:32.159
Danny!

34:32.262 --> 34:34.396
<i>We got him.</i>

34:34.498 --> 34:35.964
<i>Alice got him.</i>

34:45.000 --> 34:46.565
We want a name. Who hired you?

34:46.668 --> 34:48.467
I get hired and paid
anonymously,

34:48.536 --> 34:51.471
So you may as well
just kill me now.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.806
No one's gonna kill you.

34:52.908 --> 34:54.206
Speak for yourself.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.509
I'll take this from here.

34:55.610 --> 34:57.110
That's not how we deal
with things.

34:57.212 --> 34:58.144
You work for me, remember?

34:58.213 --> 34:59.713
Actually, we don't.

35:00.749 --> 35:02.182
Not anymore.

35:02.251 --> 35:04.017
We did what you paid us to do.

35:04.119 --> 35:07.387
Now we're done. Right, allie?

35:13.562 --> 35:15.695
Fine.

35:15.797 --> 35:18.999
Don't kill anyone.

35:27.943 --> 35:29.709
So, what now?

35:29.778 --> 35:33.013
You torture me, kill me?

35:33.081 --> 35:34.948
Don't be so melodramatic.

35:40.322 --> 35:41.988
I'm gonna hire you.

35:44.393 --> 35:45.692
You can't arrest kenji.

35:45.794 --> 35:47.160
He's a smuggler.

35:47.262 --> 35:48.795
He's a culinary genius.

35:48.864 --> 35:50.564
He's a pawn,
and if you arrest him,

35:50.599 --> 35:52.132
You'll scare away his investors,

35:52.234 --> 35:53.733
His suppliers, and his buyers...

35:53.835 --> 35:55.235
All of whom you can arrest.

35:55.337 --> 35:57.137
If you don't go after
kenji tonight.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.017
Do you always get this invested
in your marks?

35:59.041 --> 36:00.273
Every time. No.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.175
We just need more time. No.

36:02.277 --> 36:03.637
The longer this
thing stays open...

36:03.679 --> 36:05.557
The bigger the bust when you
finally shut it down.

36:05.581 --> 36:07.280
Plus, think of all
the lovely sushi.

36:07.349 --> 36:09.349
We could have in the meantime.

36:09.451 --> 36:10.451
How much time?

36:10.485 --> 36:12.786
A week.

36:12.854 --> 36:14.788
You're not getting a week.

36:18.694 --> 36:21.294
Hey. How'd it go?

36:21.363 --> 36:22.996
Fine. Is danny here?

36:23.098 --> 36:25.298
No.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.968
Are... are you all right?

36:28.070 --> 36:30.270
No, actually.

36:30.339 --> 36:32.305
I was shot at today.

36:32.407 --> 36:33.506
What?

36:33.609 --> 36:35.041
I... it's fine. I'm... I'm fine.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.010
It's part of the job.
I knew that going in.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.945
It's just actually
having it happen...

36:39.047 --> 36:40.947
Sophie, should you...
Should you be...

36:41.016 --> 36:43.083
And after, danny just left
without me.

36:43.185 --> 36:45.585
He didn't call or text me
to see if I was okay,

36:45.654 --> 36:48.388
And, you know, we're...
We're supposed to...

36:48.490 --> 36:49.490
Sorry.

36:49.591 --> 36:51.925
No. Hey, hey. Stop.

36:51.994 --> 36:53.793
No. Don't be sorry.

36:55.397 --> 36:57.597
If I was shot at, I'd probably
be dead right now.

36:57.699 --> 36:58.999
Yeah.

36:59.067 --> 37:02.068
So, the fact that you're even
here is kind of amazing.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.006
What?

37:08.310 --> 37:09.709
Danny's a fool.

37:17.919 --> 37:20.153
I'm sorry. I-i shouldn't...

37:30.365 --> 37:32.565
Is this what we've been
reduced to,

37:32.668 --> 37:35.301
Parking garages at midnight?

37:35.404 --> 37:37.537
I think it's kind of hot.

37:37.639 --> 37:39.005
It is kind of hot.

37:39.875 --> 37:40.940
<i>What's this?</i>

37:41.043 --> 37:42.909
Perks of the job.

37:43.011 --> 37:46.279
What assignment includes
a bento box from vinzu?

37:46.381 --> 37:48.192
Just taking down
international smuggling rings,

37:48.216 --> 37:49.082
No big deal.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.550
You're such a good guy.

37:50.652 --> 37:52.686
I've been trying to tell you.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.492
Here's the thing...

37:59.561 --> 38:01.995
No, here's the thing...
I am a criminal...

38:03.165 --> 38:05.525
Who's now a good guy who has
to pretend to be a criminal,

38:05.600 --> 38:07.901
Because one day
18 months from now

38:07.969 --> 38:10.704
I want to be worthy
of the woman I love.

38:10.806 --> 38:17.577
The problem is, no matter
what I do from now on,

38:17.646 --> 38:20.447
I will never be a good
role model for your brother.

38:20.515 --> 38:23.216
Lucky for you, I was never
attracted to choirboys.

38:23.318 --> 38:25.518
Not even as a cheerleader?

38:25.620 --> 38:29.322
Head-cheerleader,
until I got suspended.

38:29.424 --> 38:31.157
Keep talking.

38:33.528 --> 38:34.994
You still have that uniform?

38:35.097 --> 38:38.331
I think we're done talking.

38:50.412 --> 38:51.745
Fumiko, what's going on?

38:51.813 --> 38:53.780
I was supposed
to meet kenji here.

38:53.882 --> 38:55.048
He's gone, mr. Sayles.

38:55.150 --> 38:56.316
Gone?

38:56.418 --> 38:58.118
Chef asked me to give you this.

38:58.220 --> 38:59.552
Thank you.

39:09.531 --> 39:10.964
Hello?

39:11.066 --> 39:12.732
The bureau is
giving you 24 hours.

39:12.801 --> 39:15.802
To find out as much as you can
from kenji before we arrest him.

39:15.837 --> 39:17.070
So, congratulations.

39:17.172 --> 39:19.339
This time we're doing it
your way.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.007
Yeah, about that...

39:21.109 --> 39:24.110
We may need to come up
with a different strategy.

39:26.047 --> 39:28.982
Hey.

39:29.050 --> 39:30.150
Where you been?

39:30.252 --> 39:31.818
You left me three messages,

39:31.920 --> 39:33.898
And then you don't pick up
the phone when I call you back?

39:33.922 --> 39:35.155
Good morning to you, too.

39:35.223 --> 39:36.656
What happened? Where were you?

39:36.758 --> 39:38.658
You want to know where I was?

39:38.760 --> 39:40.093
I was with tommy.

39:40.195 --> 39:43.296
<i>Where were you when you left me
alone at the plaza.</i>

39:43.398 --> 39:44.697
After I'd been shot at?

39:44.800 --> 39:47.467
Morning. What's up?

39:47.536 --> 39:49.369
You said you had something.

39:49.471 --> 39:50.603
Yeah.

39:50.705 --> 39:52.272
I left the hotel last night.

39:52.374 --> 39:55.141
To meet up with some buddies
at the fbi about tommy's case.

39:55.210 --> 39:56.643
They ran the names
patrick murphy.

39:56.745 --> 39:58.545
And the optican group
through vicap for me,

39:58.647 --> 40:01.181
And the optican group is a front
for the southland drug cartel.

40:01.283 --> 40:02.982
What? My god.

40:03.051 --> 40:05.752
So, the kincaids were selling
drugs for the southland cartel?

40:05.854 --> 40:08.688
And hiding the money in an
account with tommy's name on it?

40:08.790 --> 40:11.191
If whoever killed the kincaids
was after that money...

40:11.259 --> 40:12.725
They're gonna come
after tommy next.

40:12.794 --> 40:14.494
I'm calling him right now.

40:24.739 --> 40:26.372
Does alice know you're here?

40:26.474 --> 40:28.675
No. She doesn't. Thank you.

40:28.777 --> 40:32.946
And I would prefer, to,
keep it that way.

40:33.048 --> 40:34.514
Why's that?

40:34.583 --> 40:38.084
Because I have access
to $3 million.
