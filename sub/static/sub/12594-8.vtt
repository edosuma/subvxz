00:01.800 --> 00:04.394
***

00:07.800 --> 00:10.360
- I love it!

00:10.410 --> 00:12.628
I love it!

00:12.680 --> 00:15.069
Love it.

00:15.110 --> 00:17.442
I love it.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.448
Hey.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.483
- It's Jules.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.511
She's had me rehearsing
that line for a week.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.621
- I have no idea! All she'll say
is: "All will be revealed--"

00:30.660 --> 00:33.493
- All will be
revealed very soon.
Here. Need you to sign that.

00:33.530 --> 00:36.795
- I'm helping organize the
fundraiser for the debate team.

00:36.830 --> 00:40.231
- This is a request for $75.
- Gotta start our fundraising
somewhere.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.534
I take cash.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.104
- The line you've had me
rehearsing for a week.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.540
- No, keep practicing.
All will be revealed very soon.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.215
- I love it!

00:55.250 --> 00:57.548
- I love your enthusiasm.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.808
How close are you?
The client's almost here.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.079
- Yeah, I'm on my way.
- Got it!

01:03.130 --> 01:06.190
- [OK, good, because I want
to go over a few things
before he gets here.]

01:08.330 --> 01:10.298
- Mama needs some sugar, baby.

01:10.330 --> 01:13.163
- Mom!

01:13.200 --> 01:15.794
- Oh, I missed you!
- I missed you too.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.435
_Shade_
- Buonglorno, ml amore!

01:21.740 --> 01:24.345
Did you get all that?
- Uh...

01:26.750 --> 01:29.184
You're back early.
A month early.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.415
- My agent called.
There's this new morning show

01:31.450 --> 01:34.112
and they're looking
for a host. Ta da!

01:34.160 --> 01:36.526
Hi, Don.
- Hi, sweetie. Good to see you.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.154
- You too. _
- You smell amazmg.

01:41.530 --> 01:44.658
Or a mimosa off the southern
coast of Portugal?

01:44.700 --> 01:47.589
- No, I think it's
more like prosciutto.
- I've got a 10-pound leg

01:47.640 --> 01:49.665
in my bag.
- Ha ha!

01:49.710 --> 01:52.838
- It's enough food to
feed us for weeks.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.319
I'll
only be here until my renters

01:59.350 --> 02:01.238
move out of my condo.
Pinky promise.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.886
- Yeah, so Dad, you know how I
said all would be revealed? Now.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.649
- I love it.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.329
- I think my wife Karen has
been targeted by a stalker.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.429
- You said over the phone
her car was broken into.

02:24.470 --> 02:27.371
- Last week. She told me
not to worry about it.

02:27.410 --> 02:29.708
- She's probably right.
There are thousands of break-ins

02:29.750 --> 02:32.810
in the city every year.
- Except they didn't
take anything.

02:32.850 --> 02:35.910
Then a couple of nights ago,
I see a man across the street.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.214
He's just standing there,
like he's watching the house.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.378
- By the time I got my
glasses on, he was gone.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.752
And then the next
morning I see scratches

02:43.790 --> 02:47.328
on the lock on the back door.
- But nothing was missing
or out of place.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.396
- Not that I could see.

02:49.430 --> 02:52.399
- I haven't told her.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.637
Karen's got a lot on her plate.
She's VP of Strategy

02:55.670 --> 02:57.809
at Halcyon Lifestyles.
- I know that company.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.638
They do athletic apparel
and accessories?

03:00.680 --> 03:03.501
- She divides her time between
the Toronto and Chicago offices.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.541
Right now she's in the middle
of a major product launch.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.639
I'm luclq to see her
three days a week.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.411
My hope is I'm just
being paranoid here.

03:11.450 --> 03:13.281
- We'll look into it
for you. I will need

03:13.320 --> 03:15.652
the key to your house.
- Of course.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.628
I'd rather Karen didn't know,

03:20.660 --> 03:24.426
so I just have one request.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.938
- Hey. Uh, sorry I'm late.

03:26.970 --> 03:29.507
I had a doctor's appointment.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.668
Prostate... but I'm good.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.240
- We'll be discreet.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.875
- ** I see you and you see me

03:40.920 --> 03:45.016
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

03:45.050 --> 03:48.554
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:48.590 --> 03:50.649
* What my head overlooks

03:50.690 --> 03:54.399
* The senses will show
to my heart *

03:54.430 --> 03:57.024
* When it's watching for lies

03:57.070 --> 03:59.493
* 'Cause you can't escape my

03:59.540 --> 04:01.030
* Private Eyes

04:01.070 --> 04:03.607
* They're watching you

04:03.640 --> 04:06.302
* Private Eyes

04:06.340 --> 04:08.331
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

04:08.380 --> 04:12.271
* Watching you *

04:12.320 --> 04:15.414
***

04:19.720 --> 04:22.359
- So this is us
getting in the mind

04:22.390 --> 04:24.927
of our adversary, the stalker?

04:24.960 --> 04:27.520
After midnight? Maybe I'm
waiting for someone...

04:27.560 --> 04:29.664
- Or walking the dog.
- Smoking a cigarette

04:29.700 --> 04:33.761
without my wife finding out.
- Or... casing the house.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.531
- Adam and Karen
are easy targets.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.571
Their house is empty
most of the day.

04:42.610 --> 04:45.340
- Plenty of loot here to steal.

04:47.950 --> 04:51.909
- How is Karen's car connected
to casmg the house?

04:51.950 --> 04:55.784
A smash and grab seems like
a different class of bad guy.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.856
_ - New cars have
Immobilizer systems.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.858
Maybe he was after the car keys.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.993
- Well, why break
into the car first?

05:02.030 --> 05:04.396
And at her workplace...

05:11.570 --> 05:14.903
- Better question: why does
Karen have two smoke detectors?

05:14.940 --> 05:19.047
- Within five feet
of each other?

05:28.460 --> 05:30.928
- Wireless. And it can transmit

05:30.960 --> 05:35.329
to a DVR up to a mile away.
- Nothing says "I'm stalking
you" like a hidden camera.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.598
***

05:42.470 --> 05:44.734
Was taking it out a good idea?
- The battery's dead.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.829
Whoever was using it
isn't using it anymore.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.644
- It doesn't make sense.
If I'm a peeping tom,

05:49.680 --> 05:51.568
I'm placing this where
I can watch her apply

05:51.610 --> 05:53.544
all-over moisturizer._
You know what I'm saying?

05:53.580 --> 05:56.981
- Disturbing, but true.
So why the home office?

05:57.020 --> 05:59.818
- Didn't her husband say she was
heading up a new product launch?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.851
- It could _be
corporate espionage.

06:01.890 --> 06:03.881
- Spying on the VP of Strategy
would be a good way

06:03.930 --> 06:06.455
to pick up some insider info.
- Yeah, but how do we get on

06:06.500 --> 06:09.469
the inside to prove that theory?
- And stay discreet...

06:09.500 --> 06:12.958
- According to her husband,
Karen does have a problem
saying "no."

06:13.000 --> 06:15.867
- Here. Put these on.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.868
- So your 905 fans

06:17.910 --> 06:20.128
don't recognize you.

06:23.510 --> 06:25.501
I'm hoping to write
an article about you

06:25.550 --> 06:27.609
for WorkChick magazine.
- I'll say yes

06:27.650 --> 06:29.618
if you can answer
one question for me, Angie.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.618
- Fire away.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.550
- I sure have.
- It's what they call

06:33.590 --> 06:36.753
their store clerks.
- You've done your homework.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.929
- You train your liberators
to bring out the "real you"

06:38.960 --> 06:41.497
in your customers.
WorkChick wants to bring out

06:41.530 --> 06:43.498
the "real" Karen Boyd.
- This will tell you everything

06:43.530 --> 06:45.088
you need to know about me.

06:45.130 --> 06:48.497
- The Blisslet. It releases
vitamins directly into the
system, custom tailored

06:48.540 --> 06:50.906
to the active female body.
Every girl could use

06:50.940 --> 06:52.999
a little boost, whether it's in
the boardroom or the bedroom.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.929
- Amen, sister.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.039
Those must be
some kind of vitamins.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.139
Probably tough
to keep other corporations

07:00.180 --> 07:02.148
from stealing your thunder.
- The Blisslet launches

07:02.180 --> 07:04.819
in less than 48 hours,
after years of R&D.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.818
The thunder will be all ours.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.579
Don't run away, we have
so much to talk about.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.928
_- If this is about
keeping corporate secrets,

07:11.960 --> 07:14.656
I pity the spy who tries to go
through Karen Boyd to get them.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.089
They'll end up working for her.
- They'll be "liberated."

07:17.130 --> 07:19.530
- Karen wanted you to have this.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.197
- Oh! When did she--
- She just texted me.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.801
I know; it's frealq.
She's an amazing multi-tasker.

07:24.840 --> 07:27.638
- Non-stop.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.877
She's an over-
achieving virtuoso.
- Can't be easy keeping up.

07:30.910 --> 07:34.141
- Doesn't mean you don't have
to try. I want her life.
- Yeah, but you don't

07:34.180 --> 07:36.148
get to the top without making
some enemies, am I right?

07:36.180 --> 07:38.614
- Even Jesus had enemies.

07:38.650 --> 07:41.687
But Karen Boyd is loved
by every soul in this company.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.553
You can quote me on that.
Paul Delfino, CEO.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.093
- Paul!
- The rumours are true.

07:47.130 --> 07:49.564
: She never sleeps.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.664
I mean, is this a bribe?

07:55.700 --> 07:57.930
I want to take this.
- Live large, Everett.

07:57.970 --> 08:00.973
- I like you two.
So I want to feed you.

08:01.010 --> 08:04.138
***
- OK...

08:10.250 --> 08:12.115
: It's Adam!

08:12.150 --> 08:14.254
- I'll handle it. Hey!

08:14.290 --> 08:16.110
We don't want to intrude. Looks
like you've got a hot date--

08:16.160 --> 08:18.128
- It's not intruding
ifI invited you.

08:21.630 --> 08:24.064
Do you want to know
who these lovely people are?

08:24.100 --> 08:26.967
- Only if you need me to.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.139
He trusts me completely.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.263
It was love at first sight.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.278
- When I stole his t-shirt
back in high school.

08:33.310 --> 08:36.871
He had no idea.
- Oh, I knew.
- No, you didn't.

08:36.910 --> 08:40.038
- I'm Angie, this is Matt.
We're journalists.
- Adam Renfro.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.250
So...

08:47.290 --> 08:50.885
You're doing a story
on my remarkable wife?

08:50.930 --> 08:53.899
- Trying to. I'm not sure my
camera has the shutter speed

08:53.930 --> 08:56.990
to be able to keep up with her.
- They must have seen my heart
rate slip below 150.

08:57.030 --> 09:00.864
A conference call got
rescheduled to right now.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.232
- She's like a hummingbird.
Never stops.

09:03.270 --> 09:05.636
- Email my assistant Laura
with any follow-up questions.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.638
It was double-exciting
to meet the both of you.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.309
Your hummingbird will see you
in a few days, Mr. Renfro.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.911
- What didn't you understand
about "be discreet"?

09:19.960 --> 09:23.327
- Our cover's still good.
- Did you find anything
at the house?

09:23.360 --> 09:25.658
- We're not sure yet.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.749
Is it a stalker or is it not?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.893
- We don't know enough

09:29.930 --> 09:31.898
about your wife yet.
We need more time.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.932
- Then you better hurry.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.995
Her flight to Chicago leaves
at six o'clock tonight.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.235
Learn what you can before
she gets on that plane.

09:42.810 --> 09:45.745
***

09:45.780 --> 09:49.113
- Karen Boyd seems
to have it all figured out.

09:49.150 --> 09:52.813
Queen of the corporate jungle.
- And mistress of her domain.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.816
- Speaking of her domain,
explain to me

09:54.860 --> 09:56.828
why we didn't tell our client
about the camera?

09:56.860 --> 09:58.725
- What if Adam
planted it himself?

09:58.760 --> 10:00.990
- I'm not sure yet.

10:01.030 --> 10:04.818
- Solid theory.
- There she is.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.810
***

10:37.870 --> 10:41.362
- You sure he didn't say he'd
cover our expenses to Chicago?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.732
- You're really
into this case, Shade.

10:43.770 --> 10:46.261
It's almost like you don't
want to go home. Ever.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.972
- All right. Let's have it.
- Well, you're never late.

10:49.010 --> 10:51.240
So it must have
been something big.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.271
- I was at the doctor.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.811
- You smell like a cross
between Italian deli meat

10:55.850 --> 10:58.239
and Tuscan sun. My best guess:

10:58.290 --> 11:00.258
you had a torrid one-night
stand with your butcher.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.417
- My ex-wife just
got back from Italy.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.758
- That was my second guess.

11:04.790 --> 11:07.691
So that was her this morning,
when you hung up on me?

11:07.730 --> 11:09.869
- Yep. She decided
to surprise us

11:09.900 --> 11:12.425
a month early.

11:12.470 --> 11:15.769
The terminal's
in the other direction...

11:15.800 --> 11:19.804
- She's not going
to the terminal.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.378
Uh... whose car is that?

11:23.410 --> 11:27.039
- No idea.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.173
- Meet the new Karen Boyd.

11:29.220 --> 11:32.109
- Version 2.0.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.235
-*You

11:52.270 --> 11:55.728
* You

11:55.780 --> 11:58.806
- Definitely not
headed to Chicago.

11:58.850 --> 12:01.410
- No. Maybe she wants
a break from the rat race?

12:01.450 --> 12:04.214
- Doesn't sound so bad to me.

12:04.250 --> 12:07.117
- She's your ex-wife. It's not
like she's living with you.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.219
- That's exactly what it's like.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.228
Before she left town,
Becca sublet her condo.

12:11.260 --> 12:14.320
She can't get
back in for a month,
so she's staying with us.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.965
- Why didn't you tell her
to get a hotel?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.458
- She reached out to Jules first
and Jules invited her to stay.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.968
- A rock and a hard place.
- We've been divorced

12:23.010 --> 12:26.229
for over 10 years, but
it's like I step back in time

12:26.270 --> 12:29.307
every time I see her.

12:29.340 --> 12:32.912
- Jules must be happy
her mom's home.

12:32.950 --> 12:35.510
Not that you weren't doing
a pretty good job on your own.

12:37.550 --> 12:40.053
- Looked that way
from the outside.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.183
Of course, you can't tell much

12:42.220 --> 12:44.188
about any relationship
from the outside.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.186
- Is there trouble
in Nolan paradise?

12:49.260 --> 12:52.024
- You're dodging
the question, Everett.

12:54.070 --> 12:56.129
- Nolan and I aren't
In a relationship.

12:56.170 --> 12:58.502
We are in an adult arrangement.

12:58.540 --> 13:00.804
- Very technical.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.149
What's the problem?
Are you afraid to commit?

13:05.310 --> 13:07.141
- Why did Becca
cut her trip short?

13:07.180 --> 13:10.889
- She's hosting
a new morning show.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.889
- Weather girl to morning show
host. Impressive career move.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.026
Oh, you may recall I did
a background check on you.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.528
The weather girl
and the hockey player.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.926
I guess she melted
your icy heart.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.996
- Actually, I was the one
that did the wooing.

13:26.270 --> 13:28.238
Huh.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.500
What line did you use
to close the deal?

13:30.540 --> 13:33.134
- You won't be able
to focus on drivmg.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.535
- Try me. Melt my icy heart.

13:35.580 --> 13:38.344
- Anyone who thinks only
sunshine brings happiness

13:38.380 --> 13:41.213
has never danced in the rain.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.188
- It's a little smarmy.

13:45.220 --> 13:48.189
- Yeah.

13:48.220 --> 13:51.053
***

13:54.900 --> 13:56.549
Ever take her dancing
in the rain?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.522
- Actually,
that's how I proposed.

13:58.570 --> 14:01.198
- So many layers to Matt Shade.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.128
- And so little time.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.161
Eyes front, Everett.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.471
***

14:21.590 --> 14:24.081
***

14:31.670 --> 14:35.128
- That does not
look like business.

14:35.170 --> 14:39.334
- I'd like to revise my
corporate espionage theory.

14:41.410 --> 14:45.369
- Hello, my sew wife.
- Oh!

14:45.410 --> 14:49.073
- Karen Boyd...
- Has two husbands.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.957
- Stealing mail's a crime.
- Yeah, so is bigamy.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.195
We need to tell Adam.
- Technically, he hired us

15:06.200 --> 15:08.589
- Say we were married...

15:08.640 --> 15:10.608
- Hypothetically speaking.
Wouldn't you want to know

15:10.640 --> 15:13.609
about this?
- Schrodinger's cat.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.608
No. Schrodinger's cat.
- I'm only messing with you.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.006
- It's a thought experiment with
a cat in a box with some poison.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.541
- Any guy who's ever spent

15:20.580 --> 15:22.673
any time in a bar with his
buddies talking about women

15:22.720 --> 15:25.541
knows about Schrodinger's cat.
- Yeah. Don't open the box,

15:25.590 --> 15:28.616
the cat can be alive or dead
at the same time_. But it's
a flawed experiment.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.629
- Because someone
always opens the box.

15:31.660 --> 15:34.527
- You know what you're saying,
right? Curiosity killed the cat.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.028
Well, only half the time.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.288
The other half of the time the
cat's still alive, but is that

15:39.330 --> 15:41.366
your reality or the cat's--
- Just get in the car, Shade!

15:41.400 --> 15:44.437
- OK, yeah.

15:44.470 --> 15:47.303
***

15:47.340 --> 15:50.377
: It's unbelievable!

15:53.120 --> 15:55.076
- Mom, is there
anything you need?

15:55.120 --> 15:58.180
- Yeah. Some respect.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.188
- I've never seen her
qUIte like this.

16:00.220 --> 16:03.383
- You were never married to her.
- I was West Coast Weather Girl

16:03.430 --> 16:06.388
of the Year... twice.

16:06.430 --> 16:08.728
- They told Mom that
she needs to audition.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.467
- Tell him what else.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.992
- And that she has to
audition with actresses.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.736
- And models. Models!

16:17.770 --> 16:20.432
Can you believe that?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.369
- No. That's unbelievable.

16:23.410 --> 16:25.640
- They asked me to do
a cattle call.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.548
I'm a meteorologist.

16:29.580 --> 16:33.482
- Jules, isn't it
bedtime for you?

16:33.520 --> 16:36.614
It is a school night.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.651
- In a minute, babe.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.022
- Night.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.767
- Night, honey.
- Night, sweetie.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.621
I'm, uh... I'm gonna bench
myself on this one.

16:46.670 --> 16:50.299
You got it. Take it easy.

16:55.610 --> 16:59.171
- Cattle call.
I shouldn't have come back.

17:01.850 --> 17:05.047
- Until they can make
a Chardonnay taste--
- Taste like a Shiraz.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.081
I remember.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.269
- I really thought
I was ready for this, Matt.

17:17.300 --> 17:21.498
I think I've been Channel Three
weather girl for so long now

17:21.540 --> 17:24.703
that I just don't know
how to be anyone else.

17:24.740 --> 17:28.733
- Please. Becca D'Orsay's gonna
let a bunch of actresses

17:28.780 --> 17:32.170
stop you from being
whoever you want to be?

17:32.210 --> 17:34.246
I don't think so.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.271
- Actresses and models...

17:36.320 --> 17:38.288
- Back when I was
being an asshat

17:38.320 --> 17:40.857
and trying to keep
my hockey career going,

17:40.890 --> 17:44.451
you were always there for Jules.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.458
You were supermom.

17:46.490 --> 17:49.357
- And sexy weathergirl.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.425
- There you go, Channel Three.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.769
"So if you forget
your raincoat..."

17:54.800 --> 17:58.258
- "...Don't forget
to wear your smile."

18:07.420 --> 18:09.718
- You're gonna
bury the competition.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.581
- Thank you.

18:17.790 --> 18:19.781
Thank you.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.339
I'll see you
in the morning, Shadow.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.565
- Yeah.

18:42.850 --> 18:45.216
- My guy at the Department
of Health came through.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.684
l_(aren and Ben were married
in Vermont three years ago.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.859
- She's legally
married to two guys?

18:49.890 --> 18:52.450
- Not legally, only technically.
If the cops found out her name

18:52.490 --> 18:54.720
was on two licenses,
she could be charged.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.490
Don't even mention Schrodinger.
- OK, so...

18:57.530 --> 18:59.862
Thursday to Saturday she's
with Ben, while Adam thinks

18:59.900 --> 19:02.539
she's in Chicago.
- Then Sunday to Wednesday

19:02.570 --> 19:04.663
she's with Adam, while Ben
thinks she's in Chicago.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.508
- She drops the Lexus off
at the airport and switches it

19:07.540 --> 19:09.679
for the Jeep.
Why the car change?

19:09.710 --> 19:11.701
- Probably to get
into character?

19:11.750 --> 19:14.719
She's a different woman with
both of them. Ben works
with his hands.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.685
He designs his own furniture.
- Adam is the wealthy bull

19:17.720 --> 19:19.881
of Bay Street.
Confident, successful...

19:19.920 --> 19:23.822
- How does she keep it all
straight? The smallest
detail could trip her up.

19:23.860 --> 19:27.296
- I don't know. Might be nice to
have another life to retreat to.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.890
- It's a cop-out. You're given
one life. Master that.

19:31.930 --> 19:34.569
Your other boyfriend?

19:34.600 --> 19:37.239
- I asked Maz to do
a background check on Ben Fisk.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.231
Turns out he has a record.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.271
Misdemeanor battery
10 years ago.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.904
Then three years ago,
trespass and assault.

19:45.950 --> 19:49.408
- Oh. I wonder what our
hot-blooded artisan would do

19:49.450 --> 19:51.782
if he found out about the
wealthy bull of Bay Street?

19:51.820 --> 19:53.788
- He might have followed her
the same way we did.

19:53.820 --> 19:56.357
- Might have broken into her car
to confirm his suspicions.

19:56.390 --> 19:58.779
- Comes into the city,
he has a temper...

19:58.830 --> 20:01.799
- He_doesn't strike me as the
kind of guy who would
plant a camera.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.969
- We should still check it out.

20:08.970 --> 20:12.565
- I am ordering you a rocking
chair, custom made by Ben Fisk.

20:12.610 --> 20:16.478
- I don't need a rocking chair.
My knees aren't that bad.

20:16.510 --> 20:19.604
- I'm sure Paul Bunyan
will help you choose the wood.

20:19.650 --> 20:22.414
What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna spend

20:22.450 --> 20:24.418
some quality time
with our client.

20:24.450 --> 20:26.816
Because if Ben could have
figured out about Adam...

20:26.850 --> 20:29.284
- ...Adam could have
figured out about Ben.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.225
***

20:57.820 --> 20:59.947
- Hey, I'm Matt Shade.

20:59.990 --> 21:01.958
My wife called about
the rocking chair.

21:01.990 --> 21:05.426
- Ben Fisk. Honoured. I love
the way you played hockey.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.655
- Glad I never had to go
into the corners with you.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.328
Do you rip the trees out of the
ground with your bare hands?

21:10.370 --> 21:13.021
- Listen, I've got some
northern white cedar.

21:13.070 --> 21:15.391
Pretty much matches everything.
Keep the wife happy.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.863
- My wife's a real estate agent.
I had to marry her quick.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.902
She's always on the go.
- Yeah, mine's nonstop too.

21:20.940 --> 21:24.068
I get to see her maybe
three times a week.
- I hear ya.

21:24.110 --> 21:26.476
You know, I think the real
reason my wife wants me

21:26.510 --> 21:29.570
in a rocking chair is to calm me
down. Keep my temper in check.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.747
- Must have been tough
to give up the game, huh?

21:31.790 --> 21:34.816
- Yeah, it was.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.822
- Hi. Do you see
that man over there?

21:46.870 --> 21:49.464
I need to give him a message.

21:52.110 --> 21:54.738
- Thank you for doing this--
- Oh, sure.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.771
- Excuse me.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.048
- Oh, my God. It is you.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.344
- It's me. Angie.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.415
- I don't know you.

22:10.060 --> 22:11.948
- Beth. Rowatt.

22:11.990 --> 22:15.027
- Oh! You look exactly like a
girl I went to summer camp with.

22:15.060 --> 22:17.927
Pretty crazy. Um...

22:17.970 --> 22:19.767
But apparently she has a twin.
Sorry to bother you.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.462
- Wait.

22:22.500 --> 22:26.800
We may not know each other,
but I do love camping.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.104
- Cool!

22:32.410 --> 22:35.868
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.582
- You take it to the edge
every day for so long, you know,

22:38.620 --> 22:41.088
and then you have
to go cold turkey.

22:41.120 --> 22:45.124
What's really hard
is managing the intensity,

22:45.160 --> 22:47.924
'cause that never goes away.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.599
- I hear you.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.394
- Seems like heaven
here, though.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.465
What's there to
get stressed about?

22:55.500 --> 22:57.639
- Now, nothing.

22:57.670 --> 23:00.833
But I was different
back in the day.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.008
- I had a dispute

23:04.050 --> 23:06.006
with my neighbour
about the property line

23:06.050 --> 23:08.439
between his land and mine.
- Doesn't sound that serious.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.540
- It wasn't... until
I stepped over the line.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.649
- You step over the line in
hockey, the worst you can get

23:13.690 --> 23:16.614
is a game misconduct.
- Well, the cops were involved.

23:16.660 --> 23:19.925
Almost cost me everything.
- You still have trouble
controlling your temper?

23:19.960 --> 23:22.622
- No. I have ways
to express myself.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.799
Nothing personal,

23:24.830 --> 23:28.095
but maybe I can avoid
the rocking chair.

23:30.570 --> 23:32.663
- What changed me was Karen.

23:32.710 --> 23:35.508
I, uh... I was a mess.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.747
Probably still would be
if she wasn't in my life.

23:37.780 --> 23:40.169
She taught me not
to sweat the small stuff.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.486
Made me a better man.
- She must be some kinda woman.

23:47.590 --> 23:51.128
So... do you
deliver to the city?

23:51.160 --> 23:53.128
- As needed, yeah. I was there
last week visiting a friend.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.128
He has a forge.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.061
I'm making a ring for Karen
for our next anniversary.

24:00.270 --> 24:03.865
- She re-arranged my molecules.
If you're luclq,

24:03.910 --> 24:05.866
it sounds like your wife
could do the same for you.

24:11.710 --> 24:14.213
- Ben has no idea
he's husband number two.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.639
And we can't tell him.
It would be like shooting

24:16.680 --> 24:19.080
a really big puppy
between the eyes.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.088
- Adam's lunch companion,
Beth Rowatt,

24:21.120 --> 24:23.759
is a senior partner
at a big divorce firm.

24:23.790 --> 24:26.953
- So Adam hired us to get dirt
on Karen, so she can't touch
his assets in a settlement?

24:26.990 --> 24:29.220
- The bull of Bay Street
doesn't need any more money.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.626
So what's his motive?
- Those guys never have enough,

24:31.670 --> 24:33.558
and they hate to get burned.
- Maybe.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.591
Adam and Karen can't keep
their hands off each other.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.961
Do they seem like a couple
on the verge of divorce?

24:38.010 --> 24:40.672
- No divorce I've ever
seen or been a part of.

24:40.710 --> 24:43.975
Home, work, husband times two.

24:44.010 --> 24:46.547
The woman has it all.
- You can't have it all.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.844
At least, not when
everything's built on lies.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.713
- I wouldn't bet against Karen
Boyd. She's got something
figured something out.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.151
Apart from her two husbands,

24:57.190 --> 24:59.954
who knows the most
about Karen Boyd?

24:59.990 --> 25:03.255
- Adam and Ben only get
Karen three days a week.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.860
- But her work husband
gets her for five.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.133
We'd love a little background
info on how you and Karen met.

25:11.170 --> 25:13.229
- Sure.

25:13.270 --> 25:16.000
I was fighting my way
up the corporate ladder,

25:16.040 --> 25:19.544
and developing an ulcer.
Karen was my yoga instructor.

25:19.580 --> 25:22.140
Her energy,
her outlook on life...

25:22.180 --> 25:24.648
it completely changed me.
Soon after we met,

25:24.690 --> 25:26.681
I left the financial world,

25:26.720 --> 25:28.312
started Halcyon
and brought her with me.

25:28.360 --> 25:32.251
- And now you're here, launching
a breakthrough lifestyle
product around the world.

25:32.290 --> 25:35.623
- Simultaneously in
80 markets, in less than...

25:35.660 --> 25:39.164
24 hours.
- With Karen Boyd out front.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.760
- Sounds like she's about to
become the face of your company.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.939
How do you feel about that?
- I would have it no other way.

25:43.970 --> 25:46.666
Karen is the hardest-working
person I have ever met.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.769
She deserves to take
full credit for this.

25:48.810 --> 25:51.142
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have another meeting.

25:51.180 --> 25:55.116
- Just one thing. Her car.
It was broken into on
company property.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.311
- What does that have
to do with the article?

25:57.350 --> 26:00.581
- Can you think of anyone that
was upset with Karen?
Jealous, maybe?

26:00.620 --> 26:03.623
- Like I said, Karen's respected
by everyone around here.
You can write that.

26:03.660 --> 26:07.653
The break-in had nothing to do--
- She's had four assistants
in the last 18 months.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.897
- Karen is a generous
but demanding boss.

26:10.930 --> 26:13.728
We're very similar that way. But
I think she's left on good terms

26:13.770 --> 26:16.989
with all of them.
- Great. Thanks for your time.

26:17.040 --> 26:20.737
- Hey, listen. I don't want this
to colour your article at all,

26:20.780 --> 26:24.079
but I did hear Laura,
Karen's current assistant,

26:24.110 --> 26:26.203
shouting at her recently.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.218
The argument sounded
pretty heated.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.241
- Thanks.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.358
Maybe seeing Karen have it all
was too much for Laura.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.358
- The overworked,
underpaid assistant

26:40.390 --> 26:42.950
discovers her boss's secret life
and decides to blackmail her?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.968
- She could have asked
for a blank cheque.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.662
- Except she didn't.
Karen would have told us.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.793
- It's right in front of us,
but we can't see it.

26:49.840 --> 26:52.707
- Maybe Karen isn't
telling us everything.

26:52.740 --> 26:55.834
- I could say the same
thing about you two.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.848
Reporters for WorkChick, huh?

26:57.880 --> 27:00.041
Ben says hello... Shadow.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.344
- Yeah, he's a big fan.

27:02.380 --> 27:05.042
- What say we all put
our cards on the table?

27:05.090 --> 27:07.650
- Good idea. _
You're not journalists,

27:07.690 --> 27:10.853
so who hired you and why?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.858
- Your husband.

27:15.100 --> 27:18.319
- Adam. He was concerned
about you, after the break-in.

27:18.370 --> 27:21.237
- Cars get broken
into all the time.

27:21.270 --> 27:24.068
It is so sweet that he has
you two keeping an eye on me.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.408
Just go back and tell him
everything's fine.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.806
- I don't think we can do that.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.946
We found a camera hidden
in your home office.

27:31.980 --> 27:34.278
- We tracked the IP address.
It was anonymous

27:34.320 --> 27:36.311
and impossible
to tie to one user.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.887
- Is it possible that

27:38.920 --> 27:41.059
Adam found out about Ben?
Maybe he overheard

27:41.090 --> 27:43.081
a phone call
from your home office?

27:43.120 --> 27:46.123
- No way.
- He was meeting
with a divorce lawyer.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.220
Adam was meeting with her

27:49.260 --> 27:51.399
to get advice on a living will.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.762
We're both in high-stress jobs.
He wants to make sure

27:53.800 --> 27:55.893
we're taken care of.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.909
- She asked for a day off.
I refused. We're in pre-launch.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.079
But she apologized afterwards.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.840
Someone planted that camera.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.178
- Why don't you just
come out and ask me?

28:06.210 --> 28:08.770
- Why I married two men.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.311
- Let's ask her.
- Not interested.

28:11.350 --> 28:13.716
- It's impossible to believe
that I could love two people?

28:13.760 --> 28:15.455
- I find it easy to believe
that you're lying to two people.

28:15.490 --> 28:18.288
- Who doesn't lie
in a relationship?
- She does have a point.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.891
- The best thing you could do
right now is just convince Adam

28:21.930 --> 28:24.990
that everything is fine.
Super-fine.

28:25.030 --> 28:27.260
- Maybe the best thing we can do
is tell our client the truth.

28:27.300 --> 28:30.030
- It would destroy him. And me.

28:30.070 --> 28:32.937
I don't even know how
I would say goodbye to Adam.

28:32.970 --> 28:35.768
- Please.

28:35.810 --> 28:38.938
Just leave us alone.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.948
Hey, darling.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.288
I'm on the 14th floor,

28:47.320 --> 28:50.778
looking out straight down
Michigan Avenue at the water.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.219
Aw, miss you, too.

28:53.260 --> 28:56.024
Yeah. The Magnificent Mile isn't
so magnificent without you.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.095
Is everything
actually super

29:00.130 --> 29:02.189
- They seem happy.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.299
- Maybe ignorance is bliss.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.763
- You don't believe that.

29:06.810 --> 29:09.199
- Not for a second.

29:13.550 --> 29:16.144
Are you OK?
- I think so...

29:16.180 --> 29:18.114
- A man came out Of nowhere.

29:18.150 --> 29:21.358
Grabbed my briefcase!

29:35.840 --> 29:37.933
- What were you doing
when he came at you?

29:37.970 --> 29:42.475
- I was on the phone with Adam,
and Laura was on hold.

29:42.510 --> 29:44.876
- Which rules them out
as suspects.

29:44.910 --> 29:47.003
- You just came from work.
Ring, necklace, watch.

29:47.050 --> 29:49.018
All that bling on display...

29:49.050 --> 29:51.939
- But the thief
took your briefcase.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.879
- Nothing, really.
It was a gift from Adam.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.354
Just some marketing
one-sheets for the launch.

29:57.390 --> 30:00.359
- First they search your car,
made it look like
a smash and grab.

30:00.390 --> 30:02.221
Then they plant a camera
in your home office.

30:02.260 --> 30:05.423
Now they come after you. Whoever
it is, they're getting nervous.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.597
They're gonna keep looking.
- Assuming they don't find

30:07.630 --> 30:09.564
what they want
in your briefcase.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.569
- So what are they
looking for, Karen?
- I have no idea.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.499
I swear on both my husbands.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.804
***

30:26.990 --> 30:30.482
- And that is a Ciao Taco...

30:30.520 --> 30:34.320
miraculously combining
the mystery of Mexico

30:34.360 --> 30:37.056
with the sensuality
of the Tuscan countryside.

30:37.100 --> 30:40.194
- Brava.

30:40.230 --> 30:42.892
- You know, I bet none of
the models can spell Tuscany,

30:42.940 --> 30:45.067
_ let alone use it as an_
inspiration for their audition.

30:47.980 --> 30:51.347
It's a flavour_
explosmn, am I right?

30:51.380 --> 30:54.474
- I'm hoping it's the only
explosion I'm having tonight.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.511
- Grandpa!

31:00.420 --> 31:04.220
This is good, Mom.
- Oh, delicious.

31:06.260 --> 31:09.627
- I think you're onto something
with those tacos.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.890
Did you
really like them?

31:11.930 --> 31:13.898
I would've had a fourth

31:13.940 --> 31:15.896
if Dad hadn't beat me to it.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.932
Speaking of which, remind me
to check his pulse before bed.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.401
- Jules barely noticed
I was gone.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.668
- You know that's not true.
- I don't know.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.440
You've really stepped up.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.448
Taken on the role of Dad.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.084
- It's not a role. I am her Dad.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.657
- Yeah, now. But back then...

31:36.690 --> 31:39.454
- Yeah, let's not do
"back then," OK?

31:43.530 --> 31:46.124
It's kind of unsettling.

31:46.170 --> 31:49.662
With this P.I. thing...
that just came out of nowhere.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.032
- Yeah, it did.

31:52.070 --> 31:54.607
I mean, you
want to make this your career?

31:54.640 --> 31:58.542
- I already have.
- It can't be paying the bills.

31:58.580 --> 32:02.277
- You'll still get your monthly
cheque, if that's what
you're worried about.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.016
- I'm not. I'm just
surprised, that's all.

32:05.050 --> 32:07.541
- You expected me to screw up.
- Well, let's just say

32:07.590 --> 32:10.150
I didn't expect the first call
asking me to come back

32:10.190 --> 32:13.159
from Europe to be from my agent.
I thought it would be from you,

32:13.190 --> 32:16.353
asking me to cut it short and
come back and take
care of Jules.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.368
- Sorry to disappoint.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.698
- But instead,
she's thriving at Ellard,

32:20.730 --> 32:23.290
you have this brand new career,

32:23.340 --> 32:25.706
and Don says gorgeous boss...

32:25.740 --> 32:28.038
I mean...

32:28.080 --> 32:30.036
It's like you have
this whole other life

32:30.080 --> 32:32.503
that I know nothing about.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.314
- Whole other life...

32:35.350 --> 32:38.410
Thanks.

32:44.390 --> 32:47.279
- Angie! Angie!

32:53.230 --> 32:55.232
- Yeah, you did.

32:55.270 --> 32:58.364
- Maybe.
- OK. Now, I assume you
had a blow-up with the ex.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.605
You can use the couch as long as
you make coffee in the morning--

33:00.640 --> 33:03.632
- No, no. I figured it out.
Sort of. I don't know what

33:03.680 --> 33:05.739
the bad guys want, but I know
why they can't find it.

33:05.780 --> 33:08.613
- Because they're looking

33:08.650 --> 33:12.188
in the wrong place. The stalker
broke into Karen's Lexus --

33:12.220 --> 33:15.257
in Life A.
- Then planted a camera

33:15.290 --> 33:17.758
at Karen and Adam's house --
still in Life A.

33:17.790 --> 33:20.088
- Then they stole her work
briefcase, a gift from Adam,

33:20.130 --> 33:22.098
which also lives in Life A.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.098
So what's the one place
they haven't looked?

33:24.130 --> 33:27.361
- Life B. Because they
don't know about Ben.

33:29.740 --> 33:33.369
- It means I'm putting on
some clothes, Shade.

33:33.410 --> 33:35.503
Nothing.

33:35.540 --> 33:38.509
- We need to stop looking.
Ben will be home soon.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.506
- I was so sure it'd be here.
- Is there anything you keep

33:40.550 --> 33:43.519
only in this house?
- No. There's nothing.

33:43.550 --> 33:45.415
- It could be something
you picked up by mistake.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.688
- A few weeks ago after
a meeting, Paul asked me
if I'd taken his flash drive.

33:53.730 --> 33:55.721
- No. I checked everywhere.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.399
- Do you remember what you did
after work that day?

33:58.430 --> 34:01.661
- It was a "Ben" night. I met
him for dinner at a country inn.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.066
I was late. I didn't want
to stop at the airport

34:04.110 --> 34:08.308
to switch cars, so I took a car
service and changed on the way.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.088
- Could be.
We made 1000 of them.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.621
- Only one way to find out.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.693
- A research report.

34:33.730 --> 34:36.164
This is a risk analysis.

34:36.200 --> 34:39.829
- "Possible side effects include

34:39.870 --> 34:43.169
dizziness, cardiac arrhythmia,
neurological damage..."

34:43.210 --> 34:45.701
Sounds like my hockey career.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.514
Wow.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.848
- "An increased likelihood
of developing ovarian cancer."

34:50.880 --> 34:53.212
- There must be some mistake.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.457
We've been testing
this product for years.

34:55.490 --> 34:58.459
- You've never seen these
documents before?
- Never.

35:00.490 --> 35:02.720
"I recommend proceeding with
the launch of the Blisslet

35:02.760 --> 35:04.899
"despite the risks,
as it's more cost-effective

35:04.930 --> 35:07.364
_ than to recall our
eXIsting inventory." Look.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.790
- That's not my signature.
You have to believe me.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.161
- The Blisslet is a dud.

35:13.210 --> 35:16.373
And someone wants you
to take the fall for it.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.472
- I didn't do it.
Paul set me up.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.488
- When you swapped drives,
you got the evidence,

35:25.520 --> 35:27.886
which is why he broke into
your car, planted a camera

35:27.920 --> 35:29.854
in your house.
He was your stalker.

35:29.890 --> 35:32.381
- Your signature on the memo
was insurance in case somebody

35:32.430 --> 35:34.819
found out about the report.
!

35:34.860 --> 35:36.851
- OK, just focus. We're talking
about people's lives here.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.664
You need to tell the truth--

35:42.340 --> 35:44.808
- The truth about
global warming.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.832
Because it just got
a lot warmer in here.

35:47.870 --> 35:50.577
- Shadow.
The chair's not done yet.

35:50.610 --> 35:54.546
That your wife?
- Technically... not exactly.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.786
- I'm not who you think I am.

36:00.820 --> 36:03.311
My life is falling apart.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.398
- Did we just break up
this marriage?

36:18.710 --> 36:21.804
Karen's not answering.
Maybe she told Ben everything.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.206
- We've got about an hour

36:24.250 --> 36:27.378
unt_il _Blisslet launches live
to millions around the world.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.514
- If we leak the story,
Karen will go down for sure.

36:29.550 --> 36:32.485
It'll ruin all her lives.
- But if we don't,
people could die.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.909
Unless...

36:34.960 --> 36:37.656
Unless we can figure out a way
to make Paul Delfino admit

36:37.690 --> 36:39.829
what he did, how he set her up.

36:39.860 --> 36:41.828
- I know you've
already got a plan,

36:41.860 --> 36:44.499
so I'll just get my coat.

37:01.580 --> 37:04.583
- Hey. Are you as excited
about this as I am?

37:04.620 --> 37:07.339
- I can safely say I'm more
excited than you, Paul.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.521
- I've been looking everywhere
for that bad boy. Where was it?

37:13.560 --> 37:17.291
- Wrong question. What are
we going to do about it?

37:17.330 --> 37:20.299
- Love to hear your thoughts.
After all, they got us here.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.992
- Stopping the product launch
would be a good start.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.861
Followed up by pulling all
the inventory off the shelves.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.606
- That would cost the company
a fortune. It would cripple us.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.733
- On the other hand --
the only hand that matters --

37:30.780 --> 37:33.340
we won't have harmed anyone.

37:33.380 --> 37:36.349
Paul, you know I'm right.
- You've read the risk
analy5is report.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.746
The numbers say it's more cost
effective to launch and roll

37:38.790 --> 37:40.985
the dice on any insurance
claims against the product.

37:41.020 --> 37:44.820
- Three percent of test users
suffered serious side effects.

37:44.860 --> 37:46.828
- I'll take those odds.
And so will you, since

37:46.860 --> 37:48.896
it's your signature on the memo
approving the roll-out.

37:48.930 --> 37:51.023
- You know I didn't
sign that memo.

37:51.060 --> 37:55.429
- I do. But unless you want
to commit career suicide

37:55.470 --> 37:58.064
and possibly risk jail time,
I suggest you go out

37:58.100 --> 38:00.307
and_ start the live_
streaming presentation.

38:00.340 --> 38:02.308
And let me enjoy the show.

38:02.340 --> 38:05.002
- Actually, the show
started five minutes ago.

38:05.050 --> 38:09.749
- You know, it's true. The
camera does add 10 pounds. Look!

38:09.780 --> 38:12.487
- ...cost the company a fortune,
Karen. Cripple us.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.385
- On the other hand --
the only hand that matters --

38:14.420 --> 38:16.388
we won't have harmed anyone.
Paul, you know I'm right.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.923
_- You've read the
risk analy5is report.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.394
The numbers say it's more
cost-effective to launch

38:21.430 --> 38:24.399
and roll the dice against any
insurance claims against
the product.

38:24.430 --> 38:27.729
- Three percent of test users
suffered harmful side effects!

38:27.770 --> 38:29.829
- I'll take those odds.
And so will you,

38:29.870 --> 38:31.804
since it's your signature on
the memo approving the roll-out.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.808
- You know I didn't
sign that memo.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.808
- You did this to me.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.400
- Afraid not, Paul.
This is one thing

38:38.450 --> 38:40.805
Karen can't take credit for.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.548
- Don't worry. He can't get far.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.584
I want to thank you for
helping me discover the truth.

38:53.590 --> 38:56.058
Now, time for damage control.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.564
I know you're all shocked
by what you just witnessed.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.067
But let me assure you,
from this point forward,

39:08.110 --> 39:10.431
we will put all of our resources

39:10.480 --> 39:12.698
into the Blisslet 2.0 --

39:12.750 --> 39:17.346
which we will launch only
when it is absolutely ready.

39:19.850 --> 39:23.616
I vowed to never be
anything but the "real" me,

39:23.660 --> 39:27.448
and that continues
to be my promise.

39:27.490 --> 39:31.119
- You know, she might
be a dirty, dirty liar...

39:31.160 --> 39:33.128
but somehow I believe her

39:33.170 --> 39:35.593
when she says she's gonna
clean this place up.

39:37.800 --> 39:41.531
I hear in your voice, Everett.
- No, I'm just thirsty.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.782
Congratulations!
I heard your speech went viral.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.889
- Of course it did. It's gonna
be bigger than the Nae Nae,

40:00.930 --> 40:03.490
thanks to you
two crime fighters.

40:03.530 --> 40:05.725
- I heard the Board of Directors
named you interim CEO

40:05.770 --> 40:07.920
and head of R&D
for Blisslet 2.0.

40:07.970 --> 40:10.029
- Honesty does pay.

40:10.070 --> 40:12.038
Your fee.

40:12.070 --> 40:15.005
- Thank you.
- I told you there
was something going on.

40:15.040 --> 40:18.168
- Yes, you did.
And you saved me.

40:18.210 --> 40:20.508
Warm up the car, darling.
I'll be out in a moment.

40:20.550 --> 40:22.609
I promise.
- Thank you for taking

40:22.650 --> 40:24.641
such good care of her.

40:29.220 --> 40:32.678
- Oh, look at my men.
I'm the luckiest woman on earth.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.528
Speaking of which,
Ben also says thank you.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.653
I told him to cancel
the rocking chair.

40:37.700 --> 40:40.066
- Yin and yang.
- Like Ben and me.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.830
He said seeing the two
of you together inspired him.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.572
- Don't you remember
your Whitman?

40:52.610 --> 40:55.511
"I am large,
I contain multitudes."

40:55.550 --> 40:57.768
Hello, handsome.

41:00.190 --> 41:02.852
No, the Magnificent Mile isn't
so magnificent without you.

41:04.860 --> 41:07.021
- Not a chance.

41:07.060 --> 41:08.857
- You look like you've been
drinking the Karen Kool-Aid.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.856
You ready for
a second wife, Shade?

41:10.900 --> 41:13.562
- I couldn't afford the alimony.
What about you, Everett?

41:13.600 --> 41:17.832
- Hmm, only if both husbands
do dishes, laundry and taxes,

41:17.870 --> 41:19.735
in that order.
- That wasn't a no.

41:19.770 --> 41:21.829
- It wasn't a yes.

41:24.010 --> 41:26.001
: I should take this--

41:28.750 --> 41:31.742
- Hey, Becca.
- Hey, Nolan.

41:31.790 --> 41:35.487
***

41:42.800 --> 41:44.859
- I saved you a spoon.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.664
- That's the best offer
I've had all day.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.191
- Sounds like a tough one.

41:50.240 --> 41:53.732
Maybe I should have
a talk with your boss lady.

41:53.770 --> 41:56.500
I'm kidding.

42:01.310 --> 42:03.278
- It's quiet in here.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.288
Too quiet.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.743
- Don took Jules
to see the Bulletproof...

42:07.790 --> 42:11.510
You can't keep that
guy away from a K-pop concert.

42:13.660 --> 42:17.152
Wait. Is this the infamous
"ice cream celebration"?

42:17.200 --> 42:21.660
- I made the short list!
- Of course you did.

42:21.700 --> 42:23.895
- And you helped me.

42:23.940 --> 42:26.238
- I'm not sure how I helped
you make the short list.

42:26.270 --> 42:29.273
- Mm-hmm. I sat in that
casting call today,

42:29.310 --> 42:33.701
surrounded by all these amazing-
looking and accomplished women,

42:33.750 --> 42:37.345
and I just wanted
to run and hide.

42:37.380 --> 42:40.087
But I didn't.

42:42.090 --> 42:45.218
Instead, I remembered
to wear my smile.

42:47.230 --> 42:50.791
And when they called my name,
I walked right into that room

42:50.830 --> 42:54.596
and I knew that I was the only
one they needed to see.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.066
So thank you for that.

43:00.110 --> 43:03.307
- * This is not about us

43:03.340 --> 43:06.798
* This is not about us

43:20.360 --> 43:23.124
- Becca, I have
a whole other life now...

43:23.160 --> 43:26.368
- I don't mind.

43:32.910 --> 43:35.299
