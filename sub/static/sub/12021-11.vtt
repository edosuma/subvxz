IT'S JUST, UH, BASICALLY SO THE

17:04.256 --> 17:06.824
TONGUE DON'T DIG INTO THE BED ON

17:06.859 --> 17:11.095
THE DECK.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.830
HEY, PHIL, HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO

17:12.865 --> 17:14.265
SEE THIS BEHIND ON THE BACK END

17:14.299 --> 17:15.266
OF MY LOAD?

17:15.300 --> 17:16.267
>> ABOUT THE TIME YOU SACKED THE

17:16.335 --> 17:17.168
[bleep] OUT OF ME...

17:17.202 --> 17:19.170
>> [laughs]

17:20.973 --> 17:22.473

17:22.508 --> 17:25.476
READJUST THE WOODEN SUPPORTS.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.185
>> YEAH, SHE'S NOT MOVING.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.820
THE WORST OF IT'S OVER.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.822
>> YEAH, IT'LL STAY NOW.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.523
>> [laughs]

17:38.557 --> 17:39.624
>> narrator: BUT AS HUGH GETS

17:39.658 --> 17:42.393
READY TO HIT THE ROAD...

17:42.461 --> 17:43.294
>> YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY

17:43.328 --> 17:44.195
PARKED THESE TWO A LITTLE CLOSE

17:44.263 --> 17:45.630
TOGETHER HERE.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.398
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WOULD LOAD

17:47.466 --> 17:48.633
IT LIKE THAT, BUT IT SHOULD

17:48.667 --> 17:49.634
NEVER HAVE BEEN PUT--LIKE, THEM

17:49.668 --> 17:50.635
TWO ARE LOADED RIGHT.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.103
THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT THESE TWO

17:52.137 --> 17:54.205
THAT FAR APART TOO.

17:54.273 --> 18:00.945
BUT THAT'S THE WAY SHE'S LOADED.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.580
HAD TO CHECK MY LOAD.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.549
NOTICED THAT THEM TWO HEATERS

18:04.583 --> 18:07.018
ARE, UH, SCRAPING THE PAINT OFF

18:07.086 --> 18:08.019
ONE ANOTHER, THE WAY THEY'RE

18:08.053 --> 18:09.187
LOADED SO CLOSE.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.288
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'D LOAD

18:10.322 --> 18:12.590
THEM TOO CLOSE LIKE THAT.

18:12.658 --> 18:13.891
NOT MY CALL, ANYWAY.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.393
THAT'S WHOEVER LOADED IT, I

18:15.427 --> 18:17.395
GUESS, BUT IT AIN'T ON ME

18:17.429 --> 18:20.031
ANYWAY, SO I'M NOT TOO WORRIED

18:20.099 --> 18:22.867
ABOUT IT.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.569
>> narrator: NEXT, ALEX COMES TO

18:24.603 --> 18:25.770
THE RESCUE.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.205
>> OH, MY GOD.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.507
NOW I'VE GOT [bleep] ALEX.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.929

18:34.963 --> 18:36.397

18:36.465 --> 18:39.967
PRUDHOE BAY...

18:40.002 --> 18:42.103

18:42.137 --> 18:43.738
>> narrator: ALEX PULLS UP ON

18:43.772 --> 18:45.139
RAY'S ACCIDENT.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.307
>> HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF

18:46.341 --> 18:47.241
COMMOTION ON THE RADIO AND

18:47.309 --> 18:48.409
HEARD IT WAS RAY WHO WAS IN THE

18:48.477 --> 18:51.045
DITCH.

18:51.113 --> 18:53.781
LET'S GO HAVE A LOOK.

18:56.752 --> 19:00.154
[laughs]

19:00.189 --> 19:01.689
>> OH, IT'S [bleep].

19:01.723 --> 19:02.957
OH, MY GOD.

19:03.025 --> 19:05.326
NOW I'VE GOT [bleep] ALEX.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.498
>> [laughs]

19:10.532 --> 19:11.399
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES, YOU

19:11.433 --> 19:12.166
KNOW?

19:12.234 --> 19:13.868
[laughs]

19:13.902 --> 19:15.136
>> narrator: THE FIRST ATTEMPT

19:15.170 --> 19:16.938
TO TOW RAY'S RIG OUT WENT

19:16.972 --> 19:19.507
NOWHERE.

19:19.541 --> 19:21.876
BEFORE THEY CAN TRY AGAIN, RAY'S

19:21.910 --> 19:23.711
GOT TO DIG HIS TRUCK OUT OF THE

19:23.779 --> 19:24.579
SNOW.

19:24.613 --> 19:25.513
>> IT'S A LOT OF SNOW.

19:25.581 --> 19:29.217
IT'S LIKE, WHERE DO YOU START?

19:29.251 --> 19:32.620
I'M GONNA GET FIRED.

19:36.158 --> 19:36.991
>> I'M USED TO THIS.

19:37.025 --> 19:40.895
I'VE BEEN IN THE DITCH LOTS.

19:40.963 --> 19:45.066
A GOOD TIME WILL BE HAD BY ALL.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.234
AT LEAST ONCE A WINTER, A GUY'S

19:46.268 --> 19:47.501
GOT TO DIG HIMSELF OUT OR

19:47.536 --> 19:48.536
SOMEBODY ELSE.

19:48.570 --> 19:56.277
I'VE SHOVELED MYSELF LOTS.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.279
>> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS YOU

19:58.347 --> 19:59.647
WHEN YOU CAME PULLING UP.

19:59.715 --> 20:01.082
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WONDERED WHEN

20:01.116 --> 20:03.084
THIS DAY WAS GONNA COME.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.986
WHEN I HUNG UP THE MIC, I LOOKED

20:05.053 --> 20:07.054
UP AND I HUNG IT, AND I LOOKED

20:07.089 --> 20:07.788
DOWN, AND I ALREADY CAUGHT THE

20:07.823 --> 20:09.423
EDGE, NOT ALLOWED TO GO

20:09.458 --> 20:10.892
STRAIGHT.

20:10.926 --> 20:12.460
>> narrator: AFTER TWO HOURS...

20:12.527 --> 20:13.828
>> I HOPE EVERYBODY'S IMPRESSED

20:13.896 --> 20:16.097
WHEN THE SEE THE HOLE WE DUG.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.198
>> narrator: RAY, ALEX, AND THE

20:17.266 --> 20:18.900
TRUCKERS HAVE SHOVELED ALL THE

20:18.934 --> 20:22.837
WAY AROUND THE 50-FOOT RIG.

20:22.905 --> 20:25.373
>> LIKE THEY SAY, IT'S NOT IF

20:25.440 --> 20:26.707
YOU GO IN THE DITCH, IT'S WHEN

20:26.742 --> 20:28.009
YOU GO IN A DITCH.

20:28.043 --> 20:28.743
>> YEAH, THEY SAY--WHAT'D THEY

20:28.777 --> 20:29.477
SAY?

20:29.544 --> 20:30.478
WHAT DID GEORGE JUST SAY?

20:30.512 --> 20:31.178
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

20:31.213 --> 20:31.913
>> THAT YOU'RE EITHER IN THE

20:31.980 --> 20:32.713
DITCH OR YOU'RE GOING IN THE

20:32.748 --> 20:33.481
DITCH.

20:33.515 --> 20:34.348
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF GUYS OUT

20:34.383 --> 20:36.284
THERE.

20:36.318 --> 20:41.188
>> IT'S NOT IF, IT'S WHEN.

20:41.256 --> 20:42.456
>> narrator: BUT DIGGING AROUND

20:42.491 --> 20:43.291
THE TRUCK--

20:43.358 --> 20:44.525
>> YEAH, ONE STEP CLOSER.

20:44.559 --> 20:46.160
A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME.

20:46.194 --> 20:47.028
>> narrator: IS JUST THE

20:47.095 --> 20:47.895
BEGINNING.

20:47.930 --> 20:48.663
>> WE'RE ONLY DIGGING AROUND THE

20:48.730 --> 20:49.530
OUTSIDE.

20:49.564 --> 20:50.464
WE'VE GOT TO DIG OUT EVERYTHING

20:50.499 --> 20:51.465
UNDERNEATH THE TRACTOR.

20:51.533 --> 20:53.467
SO THE DIFFS AND THE ENGINE AND

20:53.535 --> 20:54.201
EVERYTHING'S DRAGGING.

20:54.269 --> 20:55.803
IT'S ALL PACKED UNDERNEATH, SEE?

20:55.837 --> 20:57.672
THAT'S THE HARD DIGGING.

20:57.739 --> 20:58.673
>> IT'S SORT OF, I GUESS,

20:58.707 --> 20:59.807
SIMILAR TO AN AVALANCHE.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.642
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, ALL THAT

21:01.677 --> 21:03.010
SNOW CAN SETTLE, AND IT JUST--

21:03.045 --> 21:05.112
IT--IT GETS JUST ABOUT AS BAD AS

21:05.147 --> 21:06.647
ICE, AND IT'S REAL HARD TO GET

21:06.682 --> 21:07.748
YOU OUT OF THERE.

21:07.816 --> 21:08.749
>> narrator: THE ENGINE IS

21:08.817 --> 21:11.485
ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING.

21:11.553 --> 21:12.553
>> YOU CAN'T GET IN THERE WITH A

21:12.587 --> 21:14.588
SHOVEL, AND IT'S TOO RISKY TO

21:14.656 --> 21:15.489
DAMAGE STUFF.

21:15.557 --> 21:17.758
LITTLE WIRES AND LITTLE HOSES,

21:17.826 --> 21:19.226
AND SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT ALL

21:19.261 --> 21:20.461
WITH YOUR HANDS.

21:20.495 --> 21:24.932
THAT [bleep] IS FROZEN IN THERE.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.300
I'M CLEANING OUT THE RADIATOR

21:26.368 --> 21:29.236
RIGHT NOW SO THE FAN CAN SPIN.

21:29.271 --> 21:30.404
>> narrator: AFTER FOUR

21:30.439 --> 21:33.574
BACKBREAKING HOURS...

21:33.642 --> 21:34.508
>> MY SNOW BANK'S GETTING TOO

21:34.576 --> 21:35.476
HIGH FOR ME.

21:35.510 --> 21:36.944
>> narrator: RAY'S RIG IS NEARLY

21:36.979 --> 21:38.012
FREE.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.413
>> I'M REALLY WORKING UP A

21:39.448 --> 21:40.114
SWEAT.

21:40.148 --> 21:41.148
MY LEFT FOOT'S A LITTLE NUMB,

21:41.216 --> 21:43.017
BUT I THINK IF I KEEP--KEEP

21:43.051 --> 21:44.952
MOVING, IT SHOULD EITHER FALL

21:45.020 --> 21:46.420
OFF OR THAW OUT.

21:46.488 --> 21:50.191
THIS IS DALTON HIGHWAY SURVIVAL.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.559
>> narrator: BUT FOR A MAN WITH

21:51.593 --> 21:54.428
A HISTORY OF HEART PROBLEMS,

21:54.496 --> 21:57.431
EACH SHOVELFUL COMES AT A PRICE.

22:03.438 --> 22:06.340
>> HERE YOU GO.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.243
THERE YOU GO.

22:09.277 --> 22:11.879
>> HELP ME OUT.

22:11.947 --> 22:14.348
WHOA.

22:14.383 --> 22:16.217
>> I PUT A COKE AND A WATER OVER

22:16.251 --> 22:17.418
THERE WITH THE ICE, IF YOU WANT

22:17.452 --> 22:19.954
THEM.

22:19.988 --> 22:23.157
>> FIRST MY HANDS GOT COLD,

22:23.225 --> 22:26.961
AND NOW MY TOE--MY FOOT'S COLD.

22:26.995 --> 22:29.430
I'M SOAKING WET.

22:29.498 --> 22:31.432
[exhales]

22:35.804 --> 22:37.538
>> narrator: ONCE THE SNOW IS

22:37.572 --> 22:39.273
CLEARED, THEY'LL TRY AGAIN TO

22:39.341 --> 22:41.976
PULL RAY'S RIG AND HIS CAREER

22:42.010 --> 22:44.912
FROM THE DITCH.

22:44.946 --> 22:45.713
>> WELL, HE'S GONNA PULL FROM

22:45.747 --> 22:47.782
HERE, USING HIS LANDING GEAR OFF

22:47.816 --> 22:48.916
THE SIDE AND TRYING TO PULL IT

22:48.984 --> 22:49.617
OUT.

22:49.651 --> 22:50.418
AND HE'S GONNA PULL FROM THE

22:50.452 --> 22:52.887
BACK WITH IT ANCHORED, SO

22:52.954 --> 22:54.321
HOPEFULLY, BETWEEN THE TWO OF

22:54.356 --> 22:56.090
THEM, THEY CAN GET IT ROLLING.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.525
>> narrator: THIS TIME, RAY WILL

22:57.592 --> 23:01.529
BE HITCHED TO TWO TRUCKS.

23:01.596 --> 23:03.631
>> EVERYBODY'S GONNA PULL NICE

23:03.665 --> 23:06.000
AND EASY, AND WE'RE GONNA SEE

23:06.034 --> 23:07.968
WHAT HAPPENS, SEE IF SHE MOVES.

23:08.003 --> 23:11.906
>> ALL RIGHT, GET IN THE TRUCK.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.909
>> HERE WE GO.

23:17.779 --> 23:19.080
>> ALL RIGHT OVER THERE, RAY?

23:19.114 --> 23:20.081
>> YEP.

23:20.115 --> 23:23.284
>> HERE WE GO.

24:03.992 --> 24:06.727
>> ALL THAT TOOK WAS TWO TRUCKS,

24:06.761 --> 24:08.395
EIGHT CHAINS, AND TWO HOURS OF

24:08.463 --> 24:12.199
DIGGING.

24:12.267 --> 24:13.734
>> narrator: AS THE RESCUE TEAM

24:13.768 --> 24:17.371
DEPARTS, ALEX STAYS BEHIND TO

24:17.405 --> 24:19.406
HELP REMOVE THE LAST REMAINS OF

24:19.441 --> 24:22.409
SNOW FROM RAY'S ENGINE.

24:27.616 --> 24:28.949
>> THANKS, ALEX.

24:28.984 --> 24:29.650
>> YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

24:29.684 --> 24:30.584
>> APPRECIATE IT.

24:30.652 --> 24:31.585
>> MOST WORK I'VE DONE FOR A

24:31.620 --> 24:32.486
LONG TIME.

24:32.521 --> 24:33.387
>> YEAH, ME TOO.

24:33.421 --> 24:34.588
I DON'T LIKE SHOVELING THAT

24:34.656 --> 24:35.489
MUCH, BUT...

24:35.524 --> 24:36.590
>> [laughs]

24:36.658 --> 24:37.758
I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

24:37.792 --> 24:38.759
>> I ALWAYS KNEW I'D GO IN A

24:38.793 --> 24:39.527
DITCH ONE DAY.

24:39.594 --> 24:41.228
EVERYBODY DOES.

24:41.296 --> 24:42.196
BUT...

24:42.230 --> 24:42.863
>> WELL, THIS IS YOUR DAY.

24:42.931 --> 24:43.831
YOU PICKED A NICE DAY TO DO IT.

24:43.865 --> 24:44.765
>> YEAH, IT COULD HAVE BEEN IN A

24:44.833 --> 24:45.466
BLOWER AT NIGHT.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.133
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

24:46.168 --> 24:46.767
[laughs]

24:46.835 --> 24:47.468
>> THANK YOU.

24:47.502 --> 24:48.235
>> YEAH, YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

24:48.270 --> 24:51.405
GOOD-BYE.

24:51.473 --> 24:52.473
THAT HAD TO BE ONE OF THE BEST

24:52.507 --> 24:53.974
EXAMPLES OF TEAMWORK I EVER

24:54.042 --> 24:56.944
SEEN WAS A BUNCH OF US THAT DUG

24:56.978 --> 24:58.479
RAY'S TRUCK OUT OF THE DITCH,

24:58.513 --> 25:00.114
AND I WAS HAPPY I WAS A PART OF

25:00.148 --> 25:01.582
IT JUST FOR THAT REASON.

25:01.616 --> 25:03.150
AND RAY'S IN A BETTER MOOD NOW.

25:03.185 --> 25:04.585
WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD THING.

25:04.619 --> 25:06.420
[laughs]

25:06.488 --> 25:08.155
ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT I COULD

25:08.223 --> 25:08.889
HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, NOT GET

25:08.957 --> 25:10.591
SOMEBODY UPSET OR ANGRY AT ME

25:10.625 --> 25:13.260
OR, YOU KNOW, ANY OPPORTUNITY

25:13.295 --> 25:14.428
I COULD TAKE TO MAKE AMENDS, I'M

25:14.496 --> 25:15.329
HAPPY TO DO IT.

25:15.397 --> 25:17.231
I MEAN, WHY--LIFE'S TOO SHORT

25:17.265 --> 25:17.898
FOR EVERYBODY.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.900
WHY BE, UH, YOU KNOW, WHY HAVE

25:19.935 --> 25:21.335
PEOPLE BEING UPSET WITH YOU?

25:21.403 --> 25:22.336
YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE

25:22.370 --> 25:24.405
BEING UPSET WITH ME.

25:24.439 --> 25:26.507
>> YEAH, AS FAR AS ALEX GOES,

25:26.541 --> 25:28.809
I GOTTA ADMIT, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

25:28.877 --> 25:29.710
HE COWBOYED UP.

25:29.744 --> 25:31.779
HE GOT IN THE DITCH WITH THREE

25:31.813 --> 25:33.781
OR FOUR OTHER CARLILE GUYS AND

25:33.815 --> 25:35.516
HE STARTED SHOVELING.

25:35.550 --> 25:36.884
WE WERE ALL IN THERE, SHOVELING

25:36.918 --> 25:37.818
TOGETHER.

25:37.886 --> 25:39.086
HE WAS A TEAM PLAYER RIGHT

25:39.120 --> 25:40.254
THERE, AND THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD

25:40.322 --> 25:42.056
OF HIM, AND I WAS GETTING PRETTY

25:42.090 --> 25:43.524
HARD ON HIM THERE FOR A WHILE,

25:43.592 --> 25:45.626
SO I'LL LET UP TOO.

25:45.694 --> 25:47.795
I MEAN, HE STARTED IT, THOUGH.

25:47.862 --> 25:49.630
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'LL LET IT GO,

25:49.664 --> 25:51.999
AND IF HE WANTS TO WIPE A CLEAN

25:52.033 --> 25:53.534
SLATE AND WE CAN START ALL OVER

25:53.568 --> 25:55.736
AGAIN, I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

26:04.412 --> 26:07.147
IT TO PRUDHOE IN RECORD TIME.

26:07.182 --> 26:08.816
>> EVERY TIME I SEE THIS YARD,

26:08.850 --> 26:12.786
THAT MEANS A LOAD IS COMPLETE.

26:12.821 --> 26:16.457
JUST LIKE MONEY IN THE BANK.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.925
>> narrator: BUT ON THE WAY UP,

26:17.993 --> 26:19.159
ONE OF THE HEATERS HAS BEEN

26:19.194 --> 26:21.929
DAMAGED.

26:21.963 --> 26:23.897
>> I JUST DROP MY LOAD, TAKE MY

26:23.932 --> 26:24.932
PAPERWORK IN THERE, AND THEY'LL

26:24.966 --> 26:26.834
FIGURE IT OUT.

26:26.868 --> 26:27.901
PROBABLY THE CUSTOMER WILL SAY,

26:27.936 --> 26:32.339
"WELL, THIS ONE'S SCRATCHED."

26:32.374 --> 26:34.208
HOW'S IT GOING, BILLY?

26:35.410 --> 26:36.477

26:37.379 --> 26:39.747
>> YEAH, I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW.

26:39.781 --> 26:41.181
>> I LOOK FORWARD TO YOU PULLING

26:41.216 --> 26:44.018
THE SAME LOAD.

26:44.052 --> 26:45.919

26:45.987 --> 26:46.754
YOU?

26:46.821 --> 26:48.289
>> YEAH, SEVEN MORE DAYS.

26:48.323 --> 26:49.657

26:49.691 --> 26:51.692

OKAY, WE'LL SEE YOU WEDNESDAY.

26:58.300 --> 26:59.033
THANKS.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.410

27:09.444 --> 27:12.413
WITH LOAD NUMBER 12, BUT IT'S

27:12.447 --> 27:14.748
NOT LONG BEFORE THE YARD

27:14.816 --> 27:17.184
SUPERVISOR NOTICES A PROBLEM.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.019
>> I'M INSPECTING A LOAD THAT

27:19.054 --> 27:20.220
HUGH BROUGHT UP, 'CAUSE ONE OF

27:20.288 --> 27:21.388
THE LOADER OPERATORS BROUGHT TO

27:21.423 --> 27:22.756
MY ATTENTION THAT, UH, THERE'S

27:22.824 --> 27:25.492
SOME DAMAGED FREIGHT ON THERE.

27:25.560 --> 27:29.229
LOOSE.

27:29.297 --> 27:31.131
THAT ONE'S A LITTLE LOOSE.

27:31.166 --> 27:32.232
THIS CHAIN HERE, HOLDING IT TO

27:32.300 --> 27:33.734
THE TRAILER SHOULD BE TIGHT.

27:33.768 --> 27:34.935
YOU KNOW, THAT--THAT'S WAY

27:34.969 --> 27:38.305
LOOSE.

27:38.340 --> 27:40.507
GREAT, WE GOT DAMAGE.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.609
SEE, THIS TRAILER, DUE TO THE

27:42.677 --> 27:43.944
LOOSE CHAINS AND THE LOAD NOT

27:43.978 --> 27:45.746
BEING CHECKED, RUBBED INTO THE

27:45.780 --> 27:47.848
EXIT POINT TO THE HEATER, SO NOW

27:47.882 --> 27:48.615
IT'S RUBBED SOME OF THE PAINT

27:48.683 --> 27:50.117
OFF OF ONE OF THE DOORS.

27:50.151 --> 27:51.618
IT COULD HAVE CHALKED THE TIRES

27:51.686 --> 27:52.953
WITH MORE DUNNAGE.

27:52.987 --> 27:54.855
IT COULD BE A DISASTER IF

27:54.889 --> 27:56.323
SOMETHING BREAKS LOOSE, COMES

27:56.391 --> 27:57.057
OFF THE TRAILER.

27:57.125 --> 27:58.225
IT MIGHT FALL ONTO THE ROAD AND

27:58.293 --> 28:00.961
HIT AN ONCOMING CAR OR...

28:00.995 --> 28:02.229
I THOUGHT HUGH WAS AN

28:02.297 --> 28:03.597
EXPERIENCED TRUCKER.

28:03.665 --> 28:06.433
WHAT HUGH DIDN'T DO ON HIS WAY

28:06.468 --> 28:08.602
UP THE ROAD, MY SUSPICIONS IS,

28:08.636 --> 28:09.870
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STOP EVERY

28:09.904 --> 28:12.072
TWO HOURS AND CHECK YOUR LOAD.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.774
I DON'T THINK HE DID.

28:13.808 --> 28:15.409
I MEAN, ONCE HE SAW THAT THIS IS

28:15.443 --> 28:17.978
SO CLOSE UP HERE, THIS ISN'T

28:18.046 --> 28:18.679
GOOD.

28:18.713 --> 28:20.514
I MEAN, IF THE CUSTOMER WANTS

28:20.548 --> 28:22.249
TO, UH, MAKE A CLAIM ON THE

28:22.317 --> 28:23.250
PAINT, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY

28:23.284 --> 28:25.419
FOR IT, AND IN TURN, HUGH'S

28:25.453 --> 28:28.422
GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

>> narrator: COMING UP, RAY OWNS

28:34.028 --> 28:35.329
UP TO HIS MISTAKE.

28:35.363 --> 28:37.164
>> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, UH, THE

28:37.232 --> 28:39.233
BOSSES ARE GONNA SAY?

28:39.267 --> 28:41.969
>> AND HUGH DENIES MAKING ONE.

28:42.003 --> 28:42.903
>> I'LL TELL 'EM TO STUFF IT UP

28:42.971 --> 28:43.971
THEIR ASS IF THEY'RE TRYING TO

28:44.005 --> 28:47.991
BLAME ME FOR IT.

>> narrator: 50 MILES SOUTH OF

28:51.563 --> 28:53.897
COLDFOOT, LISA IS STRUGGLING

28:53.932 --> 28:55.432
TO KEEP HER BEAR CAGE STRAPPED

28:55.467 --> 28:58.302
DOWN.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.706
>> LOOKS LIKE I GOT A TAIL

29:02.741 --> 29:06.477
DRAGGING THERE.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.278
STRAP 'EM UP.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.481
PULL OVER HERE AND TUCK IT BACK

29:10.548 --> 29:12.483
IN, PUT HER BACK WHERE IT

29:12.517 --> 29:14.918
BELONGS.

29:14.953 --> 29:19.089
YEAH.

29:19.124 --> 29:23.627
DAMN.

29:23.661 --> 29:25.129
IT CUT ITSELF ON THIS RIGHT

29:25.163 --> 29:28.031
HERE.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.399
THERE WAS NOTHING PROTECTING IT

29:29.467 --> 29:31.101
FROM RUBBING ON THAT BOLT AND

29:31.136 --> 29:32.836
SAWING ITSELF IN HALF, SO...

29:32.871 --> 29:34.138
YEAH, WHEN I HAD MY LOAD LIGHTS

29:34.172 --> 29:36.140
ON, I JUST NOTICED THE TAIL END,

29:36.174 --> 29:37.141
AND I WAS JUST GONNA TUCK IT

29:37.208 --> 29:38.142
BACK IN, AND THEN WHEN I WALKED

29:38.209 --> 29:39.109
BACK THERE IT WAS HALFWAY

29:39.144 --> 29:39.843
THROUGH, SO...

29:39.878 --> 29:40.677
WELL, THERE'S ONLY TWO STRAPS ON

29:40.712 --> 29:41.311
IT.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.045
THERE'S ONE IN THE FRONT,

29:42.113 --> 29:42.746
ONE IN THE BACK.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.547
SO IF I LOSE THE ONE IN THE

29:43.581 --> 29:44.381
BACK, I GOT ONE STRAP HOLDING

29:44.415 --> 29:45.048
IT.

29:45.083 --> 29:45.949
AND IT'S LIGHT ENOUGH, BUT IT'S

29:46.017 --> 29:46.917
NOT SECURE ENOUGH.

29:46.951 --> 29:47.951
>> narrator: WITH ONE STRAP

29:47.986 --> 29:49.753
DAMAGED, THE OVERSIZED CAGE

29:49.788 --> 29:51.388
COULD EASILY BE KNOCKED LOOSE

29:51.422 --> 29:53.390
AND COME CRASHING ONTO THE ROAD.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.458
>> JUST HOPING I CAN THROW THAT

29:54.492 --> 29:56.126
HIGH.

29:56.161 --> 29:58.128
I'M DEBATING HOW TO DO THIS.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.830
I HAVE AN IDEA.

29:59.864 --> 30:05.335
I JUST HAD A BRAINSTORM.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.570
>> WHY IS THAT SO STIFF?

30:06.604 --> 30:10.040
>> IT'S FROZEN.

30:10.108 --> 30:11.241
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S AS TIGHT AS

30:11.276 --> 30:12.676
THAT ONE'S GOING FOR ME.

30:12.744 --> 30:13.977
OKAY, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOOD.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.045
WE'LL SEE HOW SHE HOLDS.

30:15.079 --> 30:16.146
HOPEFULLY IT'S CUSHIONING IT

30:16.214 --> 30:18.682
AGAINST THE BOLT THAT'S PUTTING

30:18.716 --> 30:19.483
IT IN HALF THERE.

30:19.517 --> 30:20.584
SO I THINK I'M GONNA KEEP AN EYE

30:20.618 --> 30:28.792
ON THIS LOAD.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.160
>> narrator: JUST FIVE MILES

30:30.195 --> 30:33.797
DOWN THE ROAD...

30:33.832 --> 30:34.765

30:34.799 --> 30:36.934
THE STRAPS KEEP FALLING OFF.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.735

30:38.803 --> 30:42.339
AGAIN.

30:42.407 --> 30:43.507
I'M DRAGGING THAT STRAP AGAIN,

30:43.575 --> 30:45.409
SO I AM GONNA HAVE TO GET OUT

30:45.443 --> 30:46.577
AND FIX IT.

30:46.611 --> 30:47.344
IT JUST DOESN'T WANT TO STAY

30:47.378 --> 30:47.978
TOGETHER.

30:48.046 --> 30:48.712
IT'S ONE OF THOSE

30:48.780 --> 30:50.514
PAIN-IN-THE-BUTT LOADS.

30:50.548 --> 30:51.782
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I COULD

30:51.816 --> 30:53.617
DO TO MAKE THIS STUFF STAY.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.219
I'M ABOUT READY TO BUNGEE THIS

30:55.253 --> 31:02.526

CAN DELIVER BEFORE DISASTER

32:59.110 --> 32:59.776
A WRECKER.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.045
IT DIDN'T COST ANYTHING.

33:02.113 --> 33:03.146

33:29.173 --> 33:30.941
WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW, YOU KNOW?

33:30.975 --> 33:39.683
I'LL DEAL WITH IT TOMORROW.

33:39.717 --> 33:41.251
>> narrator: BACK ON THE ROAD,

33:41.319 --> 33:43.420
LISA KELLY IS STILL FIGHTING TO

33:43.454 --> 33:47.157
KEEP HER LOAD ON THE TRAILER.

33:47.225 --> 33:48.992
>> WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

33:49.060 --> 33:50.127
SHOOT.

33:50.161 --> 33:53.430
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.165
WHY DOES THAT STRAP KEEP COMING

33:55.199 --> 33:57.434
LOOSE ON ME?

33:57.502 --> 34:01.271
AND FALLING OUT?

34:01.339 --> 34:04.141
WHEN TOWING BEAR CAGES, YOU MUST

34:04.175 --> 34:07.544
STOP EVERY 50 FEET.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.146
IS THIS THING MOVING?

34:09.180 --> 34:10.814
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:10.882 --> 34:13.150
I THINK IT IS MOVING.

34:13.184 --> 34:14.151
I DON'T REMEMBER IT BEING ON

34:14.185 --> 34:15.452
THIS MORNING LIKE THAT, DO YOU?

34:15.520 --> 34:16.720
YEAH, LOOK HOW MUCH THAT SLID

34:16.788 --> 34:17.554
OFF AGAIN.

34:17.622 --> 34:19.356
THAT'S HOW MUCH IT'S MOVED.

34:19.424 --> 34:20.991
NOW I'VE FIGURED OUT WHY.

34:21.025 --> 34:22.726
IT'S ALREADY KINDA BEING

34:22.760 --> 34:23.727
TOP-HEAVY, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE

34:23.761 --> 34:24.961
THE STRAPS COME STRAIGHT DOWN

34:24.996 --> 34:26.830
IT AND UNDER RATHER THAN, LIKE,

34:26.864 --> 34:28.465
OUT OR AT ANGLES OR ANYTHING

34:28.533 --> 34:29.166
TO HOLD IT.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.901
SO IT'S ALREADY SO TALL AND

34:30.968 --> 34:33.970
THERE'S SO MUCH--IT'S SO LONG

34:34.005 --> 34:35.338
THAT IT'S GOT A LOT MORE PLAY IN

34:35.373 --> 34:38.175
IT, SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S

34:38.242 --> 34:38.909
GOOD.

34:38.943 --> 34:40.277
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S SO LIGHT

34:40.344 --> 34:41.645
AND IT'S SITTING ON ICE.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.013
IT'S JUST SLIDING EVERYWHERE.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.381
TRYING TO DEVISE SOMETHING

34:44.415 --> 34:45.082
DIFFERENT.

34:45.116 --> 34:46.249
>> narrator: LISA'S DETERMINED

34:46.284 --> 34:47.717
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND GET

34:47.752 --> 34:49.986
THE LOAD TO PRUDHOE UNHARMED.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.254
>> CHAINS HANDLE MORE THAN

34:51.289 --> 34:52.622
STRAPS DO.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.157
I COULD USE FOUR CHAINS,

34:54.192 --> 34:56.927
FOUR BINDERS, JUST RUN IT UP

34:56.961 --> 34:58.728
THROUGH, BACK DOWN.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.163
I'M HOPING I'M GETTING IT GOOD

35:00.198 --> 35:03.467
ENOUGH NOW THAT IT WON'T MOVE

35:03.501 --> 35:08.738
ANYMORE.

35:08.806 --> 35:09.906
I DON'T WANT TO DO A HALF-ASSED

35:09.941 --> 35:10.574
JOB.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.309
I MEAN, IT IS 14 BELOW.

35:12.343 --> 35:13.844
BUT IF I CAN JUST FIX IT,

35:13.878 --> 35:16.480
HOPEFULLY.

35:16.547 --> 35:17.747
>> narrator: COMING UP...

35:17.782 --> 35:19.950
A SHOWDOWN IN FAIRBANKS.

35:20.017 --> 35:21.485
>> HOW FAST WERE YOU GOING?

35:21.519 --> 35:22.486
>> I'M GUESSING PROBABLY, LIKE,

35:22.520 --> 35:25.856
30, 35.

35:31.112 --> 35:32.078
>> narrator: EARLY THE NEXT

35:32.146 --> 35:34.080
MORNING, LISA IS PREPARING TO

35:34.148 --> 35:35.982
FACE THE TOUGHEST HILLS ON THE

35:36.050 --> 35:40.253
HAUL ROAD.

35:40.288 --> 35:41.521
>> WELL, YEAH, THEY'RE AS TIGHT

35:41.589 --> 35:42.522
AS THEY GO, BUT THE CHAINS

35:42.590 --> 35:43.790
AREN'T TIGHT, SO I GOTTA BACK

35:43.825 --> 35:44.791
'EM OFF AND GET ANOTHER LINK.

35:44.859 --> 35:45.992
>> narrator: IF THE CHAINS DON'T

35:46.027 --> 35:48.261
HOLD, THE BEAR CAGE COULD BREAK

35:48.296 --> 35:50.063
FREE, THROWING HER LOAD OFF

35:50.097 --> 35:52.499
BALANCE AND SENDING HER TRUCK

35:52.533 --> 35:53.600
INTO THE DITCH.

35:53.634 --> 35:54.868
>> AND THE BEAR CAGE IS BEING

35:54.902 --> 35:57.170
A PAIN IN THE BUTT.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.371
I GOT IT CHAINED REALLY GOOD.

35:58.439 --> 35:59.906
I GOT CONFIDENCE THAT IT'S GONNA

35:59.974 --> 36:06.146
HOLD.

36:06.180 --> 36:07.647
>> narrator: BUT LISA'S STRUGGLE

36:07.715 --> 36:09.616
WITH HER LOAD CAN'T COMPARE TO

36:09.650 --> 36:11.818
RAY'S BAD DAY.

36:11.853 --> 36:13.353
>> 10-4.

36:13.387 --> 36:14.988
>> WHAT'S UP, ALEX?

36:21.829 --> 36:23.063
OH, NICE, NICE.

36:23.097 --> 36:25.198
DIG A BIG HOLE THERE?

36:25.266 --> 36:26.566
>> WELL, YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE

36:26.634 --> 36:27.567
ABLE TO SEE THE BOTTOM UNLESS

36:27.635 --> 36:28.535
YOU'VE GOT A PAIR OF

36:28.569 --> 36:30.003
BINOCULARS.

36:30.071 --> 36:31.972
>> YEAH, IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

36:34.942 --> 36:36.376
[laughs]

36:36.444 --> 36:37.477
YOU'RE FUNNY.

36:37.545 --> 36:39.012
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

36:39.046 --> 36:40.280
>> narrator: LISA KNOWS WHAT

36:40.314 --> 36:41.915
RAY'S GOING THROUGH.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.817
SHE'S HAD HER SHARE OF RUMORS

36:43.851 --> 36:45.285
AND INSULTS.

36:45.319 --> 36:46.653
>> I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS

36:46.721 --> 36:48.555
TO DRIVE ON THIS ROAD.

36:48.589 --> 36:49.756
HE'S DOING THE BEST AS HE CAN

36:49.824 --> 36:51.391
TO FIT IN.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.659
HE'S GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

36:52.727 --> 36:53.660
THERE'S SOME THINGS HE DOESN'T

36:53.728 --> 36:56.763
KNOW, BUT HE'S TRYING.

36:56.797 --> 36:57.731
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF ONE OF

36:57.765 --> 36:59.833
THOSE STICKY SITUATIONS WHERE

36:59.867 --> 37:01.568
IT'S HARD TO ASK FOR HELP 'CAUSE

37:01.636 --> 37:02.769
PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF YOU, BUT THEN

37:02.837 --> 37:04.004
IF YOU DON'T ASK FOR HELP, THEN

37:04.038 --> 37:05.839
PEOPLE WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU.

37:05.907 --> 37:09.209
SO IT'S KIND OF BOTH WAYS.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.755
[horn honks]

37:33.968 --> 37:35.769
>> narrator: FINALLY, LISA PULLS

37:35.836 --> 37:39.239
HER LOAD INTO PRUDHOE BAY.

37:39.273 --> 37:41.574
ALL SEASON, LISA'S BEEN WORKING

37:41.642 --> 37:43.243
TO GAIN RESPECT ON THE HAUL

37:43.311 --> 37:46.513
ROAD.

37:46.547 --> 37:48.315
THIS LOAD WAS NOTHING BUT

37:48.382 --> 37:50.850
TROUBLE, AND LISA'S PROVED SHE

37:50.885 --> 37:52.852
WAS UP TO THE CHALLENGE.

37:52.887 --> 37:54.788
>> YEAH, THE CHAINS--THE CHAINS

37:54.822 --> 37:55.488
DID GOOD.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.290
THEY HELD IT DOWN.

37:57.325 --> 37:59.659
THAT'S THE WAY--THAT'S THE WAY

37:59.694 --> 38:02.228
IT'S DONE.

38:11.405 --> 38:12.339
>> narrator: AT THE OTHER END OF

38:12.406 --> 38:13.873
THE DALTON, HUGH ROWLAND'S BEEN

38:13.941 --> 38:15.842
CALLED IN TO ANSWER FOR HIS

38:15.876 --> 38:19.612
DAMAGED LOAD.

38:32.693 --> 38:33.626
>> HEY, BOSS.

38:33.661 --> 38:34.527
>> HUGH, HOW WE DOING?

38:34.595 --> 38:35.628
>> NOT BAD. YOU?

38:35.663 --> 38:36.963
>> I'M DOING OKAY.

38:36.998 --> 38:38.164
I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

38:38.232 --> 38:39.265
THAT LOAD OF HEATERS YOU TOOK

38:39.333 --> 38:41.434
UP.

38:41.469 --> 38:42.602
I GUESS BILLY TALKED TO YOU IN

38:42.636 --> 38:43.436
PRUDHOE ALREADY?

38:43.471 --> 38:44.070
>> NOPE.

38:44.138 --> 38:46.406
>> OH.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.274
I GUESS TWO OF THE HEATERS,

38:48.342 --> 38:49.776
THEY MUST HAVE MOVED ON THE

38:49.810 --> 38:50.777
TRAILER.

38:50.811 --> 38:51.878
SO, YOU KNOW, THEY GOT THE

38:51.912 --> 38:53.446
EXHAUST PORTS ON THEM.

38:53.481 --> 38:54.914
YEAH, THE TWO ON THE FRONT,

38:54.949 --> 38:56.349
I THINK IT WAS, THEY MOVED,

38:56.417 --> 38:57.817
AND THE ONE, THE EXHAUST PORTS

38:57.885 --> 38:59.052
RUBBED ON THE DOOR OF THE OTHER

38:59.086 --> 38:59.819
ONE.

38:59.854 --> 39:00.820
>> SCRATCHED IT?

39:00.855 --> 39:02.188
>> EH, YEAH, RUBBED IT PRETTY

39:02.223 --> 39:02.822
GOOD.

39:02.890 --> 39:03.823
HE TOOK SOME PICTURES AND SENT

39:03.858 --> 39:07.360
THEM UP TO ME.

39:07.395 --> 39:08.728
>> WELL, THEY WERE TIGHT.

39:08.763 --> 39:09.829
THEY WERE TIGHT ALL THE TIME.

39:09.897 --> 39:10.897
>> IT'S A MATTER OF CHECKING THE

39:10.965 --> 39:12.098
LOAD AND MAKING SURE THE CHAINS

39:12.133 --> 39:12.732
STAY TIGHT.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.433
>> ALWAYS.

39:13.467 --> 39:15.001
I CHECKED, LIKE, AT HILLTOP.

39:15.036 --> 39:16.169
ALIVE AND GOOD ALL THE WAY UP,

39:16.203 --> 39:17.537
SO NO PROBLEM.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.471
IT'S ALL BETTER.

39:18.539 --> 39:19.439
>> YEAH, IF YOU NOTICE SOMETHING

39:19.473 --> 39:20.373
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GOT

39:20.441 --> 39:21.274
ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU PULL

39:21.342 --> 39:22.108
OUT OF THE YARD, WE CAN ALWAYS--

39:22.176 --> 39:23.076
>> BUT, NO, IT WAS GOOD.

39:23.110 --> 39:23.977
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST FROM THE

39:24.011 --> 39:24.644
TRAILER FLEXING.

39:24.678 --> 39:25.378
IT CAN DO THAT.

39:25.413 --> 39:26.546
>> YEAH.

39:26.580 --> 39:28.281
YEAH, WHENEVER IN DOUBT, WE CAN

39:28.349 --> 39:29.449
FIX THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF.

39:29.483 --> 39:30.083
>> RIGHT.

39:30.117 --> 39:31.017
OH, FOR SURE, YEAH.

39:31.085 --> 39:31.718
OKAY?

39:31.752 --> 39:33.053
OKAY, THAT'S ALL GOOD THEN.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.154
>> ALL RIGHT.

39:34.188 --> 39:34.821
>> OKAY, THANKS.

39:34.889 --> 39:38.925
>> YEAH.

39:38.993 --> 39:41.027
>> LIKE I SAID, IT'S NO CONCERN

39:41.062 --> 39:41.728
OF MINE.

39:41.762 --> 39:43.196
I MEAN, MY LOAD WAS STRAPPED

39:43.230 --> 39:44.664
AND TIGHT ALL THE WAY UP THERE.

39:44.698 --> 39:46.433
IT'S JUST TOO CLOSE TOGETHER--

39:46.467 --> 39:47.634
A MATTER OF BEING TOO CLOSE

39:47.668 --> 39:49.202
TOGETHER AND FLEXING GOING DOWN

39:49.236 --> 39:50.203
THE ROAD.

39:50.271 --> 39:53.573
SO WHOEVER LOADED IT, IT'S ON

39:53.641 --> 39:55.008
THEM, SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT

39:55.042 --> 39:58.478
HAPPENS.

39:58.546 --> 40:00.080
>> narrator: HUGH GOT OFF EASY

40:00.114 --> 40:01.114
WITH DISPATCH.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.116
BUT A DAMAGED LOAD IS NO SMALL

40:03.184 --> 40:04.084
PROBLEM.

40:04.118 --> 40:05.385
>> NO, WE CALLED ON HUGH, AND HE

40:05.453 --> 40:07.287
DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.289
BUT HE CHOSE JUST TO NEGLECT IT

40:09.323 --> 40:10.857
AND GO ON HIS WAY.

40:10.925 --> 40:11.925
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

40:11.959 --> 40:12.859
>> narrator: AND NOW THE

40:12.927 --> 40:14.661
CARLILE BRASS WILL BE KEEPING

40:14.728 --> 40:16.463
A CLOSE EYE ON HUGH.

40:16.497 --> 40:17.564
>> HUGH ACTED LIKE IT WASN'T

40:17.598 --> 40:18.298
A BIG DEAL.

40:18.332 --> 40:19.566
IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

40:19.633 --> 40:20.733
NOW HE'S GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR

40:20.768 --> 40:21.734
THAT.

40:21.769 --> 40:23.570
[horn honking]

40:23.604 --> 40:25.939
>> [laughs]

40:25.973 --> 40:27.107

40:27.141 --> 40:29.142
TOWN, RAY VEILLEUX IS HEADED

40:29.210 --> 40:32.145
IN TO TAKE A DRUG TEST.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.213
>> WELL, I'M HEADED INTO

40:33.247 --> 40:35.281
FAIRBANKS RIGHT NOW.

40:35.316 --> 40:37.417
AND GONNA DROP OFF THE TRAILER

40:37.451 --> 40:38.685
IN THE YARD.

40:38.719 --> 40:39.953
I GOT TO PEE IN A CUP.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.321
THAT'S THE EASY PART.

40:41.355 --> 40:42.956
AND GO DROP OFF MY PAPERWORK

40:43.023 --> 40:45.058
AT DISPATCH AND GO MEET THE

40:45.092 --> 40:46.326
BOSSES.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.760
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

40:47.795 --> 40:49.062
I'LL TRY TO WALK OUT OF THERE

40:49.130 --> 40:51.397
WITH MY JOB, HOPEFULLY, SO...

40:51.432 --> 40:54.767
AND IF I LOSE MY JOB, THEN I'LL

40:54.802 --> 40:56.402
BE KNOCKING AT PEOPLE'S DOORS

40:56.470 --> 40:57.604
LOOKING FOR A JOB,

40:57.638 --> 41:00.140
SO THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

41:00.174 --> 41:01.407
>> narrator: ONE MOMENT OF

41:01.475 --> 41:03.510
DISTRACTION COULD COST HIM

41:03.577 --> 41:10.150
EVERYTHING.

41:10.217 --> 41:11.317
[knocks]

41:11.352 --> 41:12.318
>> COME IN.

41:12.353 --> 41:13.153
>> HEY.

41:13.187 --> 41:13.953
>> HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

41:13.988 --> 41:14.888
>> YOU NEED TO SEE ME?

41:14.922 --> 41:16.055
>> UH, YES.

41:16.090 --> 41:17.590
HAVE A SEAT.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.425
SO SOUNDS LIKE WE HAD AN

41:19.493 --> 41:20.426
INCIDENT UP THERE, HUH?

41:20.494 --> 41:21.261
>> YEP.

41:21.295 --> 41:21.961
>> WHERE AT?

41:22.029 --> 41:23.530
>> RIGHT ON TOP OF ICE CUT,

41:23.597 --> 41:25.431
MILE MARKER 325.

41:25.466 --> 41:26.166
>> COMING SOUTH?

41:26.200 --> 41:26.799
>> YEP.

41:26.867 --> 41:28.034
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

41:28.068 --> 41:29.903
>> I WAS HEADING SOUTH, AND I

41:29.937 --> 41:31.604
WENT AND CALLED OUT "ICE CUT"

ON THE C.B.

41:34.375 --> 41:38.811
ICE CUT SOUTHBOUND.

41:38.879 --> 41:39.879
PUT THE MIC UP.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.080
