WEBVTT

00:08.528 --> 00:10.561
Once a month, when the moon
is a waxing gibbous

00:10.563 --> 00:13.197
we have to have procreation sex
with our dumb husbands.

00:13.199 --> 00:15.032
First, we have
to do a ritual dance

00:15.034 --> 00:16.600
to ensure we have a male heir.

00:16.602 --> 00:18.936
This world does not need
more girls.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.573
I don't know why we took all
that land from the Indians

00:22.575 --> 00:25.776
if we're just going to act
like them.

00:25.778 --> 00:28.646
I'd rather give birth to a goat
than another girl.

00:28.648 --> 00:31.849
At least a goat might have
a good idea once in a while.

00:32.885 --> 00:36.053
I'm ready.

00:39.891 --> 00:42.026
Having sex with Albert is
like being penetrated

00:42.028 --> 00:44.028
by a runny egg.

00:49.635 --> 00:51.335
Yeah, there it is.

00:51.337 --> 00:53.838
Well, having sex with Victor is
like drowning under a quilt

00:53.840 --> 00:56.040
moistened by halitosis.

00:56.042 --> 00:58.843
All right, here we go.

00:58.845 --> 00:59.944
Oh.

00:59.946 --> 01:01.178
Oh, Victor. Oh, Victor.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.947
Make your voice really deep.

01:02.949 --> 01:05.549
Oh, Victor.

01:05.551 --> 01:08.085
Uh...

01:08.087 --> 01:11.722
That's it. That's it, yes.

01:11.724 --> 01:14.658
Victor. Oh, God.

01:18.997 --> 01:20.564
Okay. Good.

01:20.566 --> 01:21.565
Aah!

01:22.602 --> 01:23.934
There and...

01:23.936 --> 01:25.603
Ah.

01:25.605 --> 01:26.604
Done.

01:26.606 --> 01:28.973
Ouch. Ow. Ow.

01:28.975 --> 01:30.207
Good.

01:30.209 --> 01:31.909
How did he get on the bed?

01:31.911 --> 01:34.745
I'm so surprised that he's here.
What? You're fired!

01:34.747 --> 01:37.481

I'm making love to my wife!

Thank you again for my job,
my handsome walrus.

01:57.070 --> 01:58.202
You're so welcome.

01:58.204 --> 01:59.603
Nothing brings me
as much pleasure

01:59.605 --> 02:02.440
as helping out
pathetic gutter wenches.

02:02.442 --> 02:04.708
Now, I'm off.
Business calls.

02:04.710 --> 02:08.279
Be back soon.

02:11.550 --> 02:13.784
What are you doing
out here, you muskrat?

02:13.786 --> 02:16.921
I was taking out the trash.

02:21.326 --> 02:25.062
Your eyes are the color
of really pretty eyes.

02:25.064 --> 02:28.199
Oh, your skin is like
a milk-fed piglet.

02:31.136 --> 02:33.437
Oh, I wish we could
sail away together.

02:33.439 --> 02:34.705
Me too.

02:34.707 --> 02:37.341
Faster, boy. I want to feel
the wind in my hair.

02:39.144 --> 02:41.946
Why are you two lawn boating?

02:41.948 --> 02:45.483
Afternoons are for defecating
and learning Latin.

02:45.485 --> 02:47.518
Mother, we can't work
all the time.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.186
Frederick, put on
a clean top hat.

02:49.188 --> 02:51.789
I've invited a widow
to the manor

02:51.791 --> 02:54.391
in hopes of making a match.

02:54.393 --> 02:55.993
Frederick
will never get married.

02:55.995 --> 02:58.562
All the women Mother's brought
so far have either left

02:58.564 --> 03:00.564
or had accidents.

03:00.566 --> 03:03.834
Pussy Von Anderstein's former
husband was a coon-tie tycoon.

03:03.836 --> 03:07.371
He made a fortune designing
raccoon-skin neckties,

03:07.373 --> 03:10.007
and as long as you don't do
anything stupid,

03:10.009 --> 03:12.243
that fortune will be ours.

03:12.245 --> 03:13.911
But we have infinite money!

03:13.913 --> 03:17.248
Yes, if we have infinite money
and we add Pussy money to it,

03:17.250 --> 03:19.049
we have double infinite money.

03:19.051 --> 03:20.384
But, Mother,
infinity can't be doubled,

03:20.386 --> 03:22.720
as its very nature is
its boundlessness.

03:22.722 --> 03:26.590
It frightens me when you
act all smart like that.

03:26.592 --> 03:28.626
Look, the day moon!

03:28.628 --> 03:31.762
Frederick,
you must take a wife.

03:31.764 --> 03:34.865
You're 23 years old.

03:34.867 --> 03:37.234
Mother, I'm 35.

03:37.236 --> 03:38.569
You're what?

03:38.571 --> 03:40.671
Yes. Right?

03:40.673 --> 03:42.940
Mm-hmm.

03:44.342 --> 03:46.443
Okay.

03:51.150 --> 03:53.083
♪ bitch, kiss the ring ♪

03:56.655 --> 03:58.322
Pussy, dear,

03:58.324 --> 03:59.990
Welcome to Bellacourt Manor.

03:59.992 --> 04:01.592
Oh, thank you, Dodo.

04:01.594 --> 04:04.328
Blanche, you shall be
Pussy's lady's maid.

04:04.330 --> 04:06.763
Actually, I prefer
a male attendant.

04:06.765 --> 04:08.065
I'll, uh, keep...

04:08.067 --> 04:09.900
him.

04:09.902 --> 04:12.836
Oh. Hmm.

04:18.510 --> 04:22.312
And here's where
you'll be staying.

04:22.314 --> 04:25.415
Just put this right here.

04:25.417 --> 04:29.653
And if you need anything else,
just let me know.

04:29.655 --> 04:31.522
Ow!

04:31.524 --> 04:33.390
What are you doing?

04:33.392 --> 04:35.592
Oh, no. That's my--

04:35.594 --> 04:38.028
I'm a pure boy, ma'am.
Please.

04:38.030 --> 04:40.230
Ow.

04:44.003 --> 04:46.436
What's happening now?

04:54.346 --> 04:56.647
Oh!

04:56.649 --> 04:59.349
Ah. Ow.

05:55.273 --> 05:57.941
Beatrice, I wonder if you might
tell me a little bit

05:57.943 --> 05:59.376
about your
twin brother, Frederick.

05:59.378 --> 06:01.177
Oh, I wouldn't bother with him.

06:01.179 --> 06:04.481
He only likes women his own age,
like, exactly his own age.

06:04.483 --> 06:08.551
Falling Charlie,
do your routine for Pussy.

06:08.553 --> 06:10.186
It's ludicrous.

06:10.188 --> 06:12.923
The falling routine is actually
quite physically taxing.

06:12.925 --> 06:16.359
But I have a loveable
new character

06:16.361 --> 06:18.595
called "The Little Tramp."

06:18.597 --> 06:23.266
Perhaps I might
try him instead?

06:23.268 --> 06:24.434
Blech.

06:24.436 --> 06:26.970
Practice your craft
in the bordello.

06:26.972 --> 06:28.738
Yes, we pay you for A material.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.073
If we weren't in
the mood for falling,

06:30.075 --> 06:31.841
honestly, we would have
hired Upright Reggie.

06:31.843 --> 06:34.077
The falling will do.

06:34.079 --> 06:36.546
Yes, of course.

06:48.726 --> 06:50.527
This fool reminds me
of my ex-husband.

06:50.529 --> 06:52.729
Oh, don't you mean
your dead husband?

06:52.731 --> 06:54.798
Oh, no, I procured a divorce.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.167
Well, I always thought divorce
was a legend,

06:57.169 --> 06:59.569
like the yeti
or the working poor.

06:59.571 --> 07:00.971
Oh, I've had a divorce.

07:00.973 --> 07:03.173
I had one in Paris
with apples and heavy cream.

07:03.175 --> 07:04.441
And it was delicious.

07:04.443 --> 07:05.976
That was pie, you idiot.

07:05.978 --> 07:07.644
Oh.

07:07.646 --> 07:10.447
A divorce is when you no longer
want to be married

07:10.449 --> 07:11.748
and, poof, you're not.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.416
I want a divorce, Mommy.

07:13.418 --> 07:15.018
Everyone knows
there are only three ways

07:15.020 --> 07:17.187
for a woman to be granted
a divorce--

07:17.189 --> 07:19.923
infidelity, abuse,
or a dead spouse.

07:19.925 --> 07:21.658
Well, Victor would never
cheat on me

07:21.660 --> 07:23.693
due to my overwhelming
physical attractiveness.

07:23.695 --> 07:25.595
Maybe I could get him
to beat me up.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.599
Oh, dear!

07:36.167 --> 07:38.300
Ooh, just a little nibble
for you.

07:38.302 --> 07:39.101
Oh, okay.

07:39.103 --> 07:41.036
Just a little something.

07:41.038 --> 07:44.540
Oh, I think I got
some crumbs in your lap.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.709
Ooh.

07:46.711 --> 07:49.545
Can I tell you something?

07:49.547 --> 07:50.846
I've been ravished.

07:50.848 --> 07:52.515
Men can't be ravished.

07:52.517 --> 07:53.983
When I was at the institution,

07:53.985 --> 07:56.452
the staff ravished all
the patients except for me.

07:56.454 --> 07:59.188
It really did a number
on my self-esteem.

07:59.190 --> 08:00.890
Well, see, as much as
I enjoy picnicking,

08:00.892 --> 08:02.358
I don't want to lead you on.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.693
I don't know if I can pick you
to be my wife.

08:04.695 --> 08:07.763
Sweet boy, I'm the one
who does the picking.

08:07.765 --> 08:10.866
But you're a woman. I'm-- I'm
the one who does the picking,

08:10.868 --> 08:13.502
because I have the geni--

08:14.672 --> 08:15.905
Oh.

08:15.907 --> 08:17.773
Oh, hello.

08:17.775 --> 08:19.508
What are you doing here?

08:19.510 --> 08:21.844
Oh, don't mind me. I'm just
having my own, different picnic.

08:21.846 --> 08:23.446
Um...

08:27.517 --> 08:29.852
Maybe I don't
want you to pick me.

08:29.854 --> 08:31.086
The only reason
I would be getting married

08:31.088 --> 08:33.489
is to ensure
our family's legacy

08:33.491 --> 08:36.225
and get mother to stop flogging
my bottom with a switch.

08:36.227 --> 08:38.760
Well, I can't say
that's not intriguing.

08:41.866 --> 08:43.499
Let's retire to my chambers.

08:43.501 --> 08:46.435
Oh.

09:03.253 --> 09:06.188
Oh.

09:09.359 --> 09:11.694
Having fun, Celine?

09:11.696 --> 09:13.729
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

09:13.731 --> 09:14.964
My name is Chair.

09:14.966 --> 09:17.666
Cut the crap, hmm?

09:17.668 --> 09:18.968
You know,
you're the whole reason

09:18.970 --> 09:21.003
that I'm here
in the first place.

09:21.005 --> 09:22.538
Before I met you,
I was a piano player.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.373
I had my own minstrel show.

09:24.375 --> 09:28.344
Lazy Black Hamish
and his Negro Knights.

09:28.346 --> 09:32.748
"I sure does wish job
was spelled S-L-E-E-P."

09:32.750 --> 09:35.217
Yeah.

09:35.219 --> 09:37.887
You know, I've been left
by a lot of strumpets,

09:37.889 --> 09:40.189
but you were the only one
with big enough balls

09:40.191 --> 09:41.991
to clear out my bank account.

09:41.993 --> 09:43.359
What do you want?

09:43.361 --> 09:45.394
I want to know what the hell
you're doing here.

09:45.396 --> 09:47.229
Why does a high-priced
woman of the night

09:47.231 --> 09:51.667
drop it all just to pluck fowl?

09:51.669 --> 09:54.803
I needed a job.

10:13.390 --> 10:15.891
I can't.

10:15.893 --> 10:19.361
My heart belongs to another.

10:19.363 --> 10:21.764
It's not your heart I'm after.

10:21.766 --> 10:23.666
You are so forceful.

10:23.668 --> 10:26.302
That is very unladylike,
and I won't stand for it.

10:26.304 --> 10:28.704
What are you doing back there?

10:28.706 --> 10:31.840
Are you--
Oh, my!

10:31.842 --> 10:35.311
That is
an unfamiliar sensation.

10:35.313 --> 10:37.379
Do you enjoy it?

10:37.381 --> 10:39.615
Ooh.

10:39.617 --> 10:41.417
I feel as though I shouldn't,

10:41.419 --> 10:42.885
but I-I do.

10:42.887 --> 10:46.121
The body has many
pleasure centers.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.357
You just have to know
where to look.

10:48.359 --> 10:50.292
Ooh!

10:54.831 --> 10:56.031
- Later.
- What if I did?

10:56.033 --> 10:58.634
What if I did?
Later.

10:58.636 --> 11:00.336
Chicken tartare?

11:00.338 --> 11:01.637
Oh, yes.

11:01.639 --> 11:04.206
My dear boy, you look as
though you've been ravished.

11:04.208 --> 11:07.643
Well, in fact, sirs,
I have been ravished.

11:10.414 --> 11:13.349
Oh, I do love a good
ravishing joke, don't you?

11:13.351 --> 11:15.217
Don't you find them
a bit distasteful, though?

11:15.219 --> 11:16.585
Some people feel that ravishing

11:16.587 --> 11:18.520
is not a topic that
should be made light of.

11:18.522 --> 11:20.055
Oh, not me.

11:20.057 --> 11:21.490
Do you know that
old chestnut--

11:21.492 --> 11:23.559
Why is it always
your ugliest friend

11:23.561 --> 11:25.995
who's the most afraid
of being ravished?

11:27.598 --> 11:31.200
That is amusing. You're right.
You're right.

11:31.202 --> 11:34.003
- There is no line.
- There's no line.

11:34.005 --> 11:36.305
Come on. Come on,
step lively, boy.

11:36.307 --> 11:40.142
Dear Lord, please let me
get a divorce.

11:40.144 --> 11:42.044
Although I have dreamed
of strangling the life

11:42.046 --> 11:45.214
out of Victor's body
or having him get hit by a train

11:45.216 --> 11:47.583
or drowning in a bath
of his own brandy vomit,

11:47.585 --> 11:50.719
I think it's kinder to have him
arrested for battery.

11:50.721 --> 11:53.489
Sorry about this, Victor,
but you're going to jail.

12:00.764 --> 12:02.531
Ah!

12:06.270 --> 12:10.272
And that's when he hit me.

12:10.274 --> 12:11.874
I'm so sorry
for your pain, ma'am.

12:11.876 --> 12:14.743
Ay, you'll tell us who the black
fella was who did this,

12:14.745 --> 12:17.212
and we'll throw him
in the pokey right quick.

12:17.214 --> 12:20.616
Oh, no,
it-- it was my husband.

12:22.019 --> 12:24.653
Well, that's another
matter entirely.

12:24.655 --> 12:26.088
Case closed.

12:26.090 --> 12:28.057
I'm telling you,
I was abused by my husband

12:28.059 --> 12:30.225
in a manner that only a divorce
would settle.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.960
Well, let me ask
you something, dear.

12:31.962 --> 12:33.362
Are you a bitch?

12:33.364 --> 12:34.797
What?

12:34.799 --> 12:36.365
Let's go about this
in a different manner.

12:36.367 --> 12:39.168
Were you menstruating
at the time of the incident?

12:39.170 --> 12:41.403
Were you riding the red river?

12:41.405 --> 12:43.939
And do you have
a raspberry bush?

12:43.941 --> 12:47.843
How dare you?
I was very abused!

12:47.845 --> 12:49.478
Looks to me like
you walked into a door.

12:50.915 --> 12:52.181
Well, that's an outrageous
implication!

12:52.183 --> 12:54.083
And precisely
the sort of assumption

12:54.085 --> 12:56.118
that makes women feel unsafe
to report their abuse

12:56.120 --> 12:57.953
to the police
in the first place!

12:57.955 --> 12:59.655
Well, the rule of thumb
clearly states

12:59.657 --> 13:01.356
that a man can discipline
his wife

13:01.358 --> 13:04.927
with anything no thicker
than his own thumb.

13:04.929 --> 13:08.130
Well, that's the dumbest rule
I've ever heard of!

13:08.132 --> 13:10.733
And that, my dear, is why
your husband hits you.

13:10.735 --> 13:13.702
If you were my wife, I'd smack
some softness into you.

13:13.704 --> 13:16.338
And I'd have hit ya
to be a bit taller.

13:16.340 --> 13:18.440
Perhaps some larger bosoms.
Now that we've settled that,

13:18.442 --> 13:20.542
would you mind running along,
sweetheart,

13:20.544 --> 13:22.144
fetch us a spot of tea?

13:22.146 --> 13:23.679
And perhaps a tour
of the premises.

13:23.681 --> 13:28.217
We hear there's a room
made entirely of candy.

13:28.219 --> 13:30.252
Well, infidelity and abuse
were a bust.

13:30.254 --> 13:33.522
I guess I'm going to have to
kill Victor if I want a divorce.

13:34.242 --> 13:35.457
♪ now, now, now ♪

13:35.551 --> 13:37.276
♪ it's mine, it's mine ♪

13:39.240 --> 13:41.607
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:41.609 --> 13:42.908
Hmm.

13:44.078 --> 13:45.478
Beatrice, what are you doing?

13:45.480 --> 13:46.979
I'm off to behead Pussy.

13:46.981 --> 13:49.815
Should I use my logging axe
or my murder hatchet?

13:49.817 --> 13:51.751
Father refuses to cover up
another murder.

13:51.753 --> 13:53.586
We can't have another
Weekend at Bernard's!

13:53.588 --> 13:55.888
You never let me do
anything I want!

13:55.890 --> 13:58.390
I have a better plan.
Let's not kill Pussy.

13:58.392 --> 14:00.159
- Let's kill our husbands.
- But I like Albert.

14:00.161 --> 14:02.094
He's the only one who can
make my bangs fluffy.

14:02.096 --> 14:03.496
No, not <i>kill them</i> kill them.

14:03.498 --> 14:05.364
Let's just have them disappear
for long enough

14:05.366 --> 14:07.399
to be declared dead, and then
we can marry whoever we want.

14:07.401 --> 14:10.536
Wait. Does that mean
I can marry Frederick?

14:13.173 --> 14:15.007
I'm sure that's what it means.

14:15.009 --> 14:17.309
Aah!

14:17.310 --> 14:18.928
_

14:18.979 --> 14:23.149
Everybody gather round.
Gather round, quickly now.

14:23.151 --> 14:25.184
I've heard some
very distressing rumors.

14:25.186 --> 14:29.622
Which among the staff
has been ravished?

14:32.159 --> 14:33.626
It was I.

14:33.628 --> 14:38.130
I was ravished
by Pussy Von Anderstein.

14:38.132 --> 14:40.432
Garfield, my God,
this is an outrage.

14:40.434 --> 14:41.734
Oh, thank you, Peepers.

14:41.736 --> 14:42.968
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself!

14:42.970 --> 14:44.136
Ow.

14:44.138 --> 14:45.704
You should be thanking
your lucky stars

14:45.706 --> 14:47.773
that she chose to ravish you,
instead of crying about it

14:47.775 --> 14:49.775
like a mewling kitten
with a pin in its paw!

14:49.777 --> 14:51.844
I'm docking you
six months of gruel.

14:51.846 --> 14:53.279
If you didn't want
to be ravished,

14:53.281 --> 14:54.647
maybe you shouldn't be wearing

14:54.649 --> 14:57.216
such an inviting
little valet's uniform.

14:57.218 --> 14:58.717
It's your fault.

14:58.719 --> 15:02.321
I wear my valet's uniform
for me.

15:02.323 --> 15:04.456
But must it be so tight,
Garfield?

15:04.458 --> 15:07.860
Hey, does this mean that
I can ravish Blanche?

15:07.862 --> 15:10.262
No.

15:10.264 --> 15:12.631
Thank you
for the thought, Hamish.

15:12.633 --> 15:14.266
Milady.

15:14.268 --> 15:16.235
All right, everybody
back to work. Skeet, skeet!

15:16.437 --> 15:21.240
Have you seen
a tiny Oriental man?

15:21.242 --> 15:22.708
He's--

15:22.710 --> 15:26.545
Ugh! How is it possible
your face is getting uglier?

15:26.547 --> 15:28.280
I ran into a door.

15:28.282 --> 15:29.314
Oh.

15:29.316 --> 15:32.584
Victor.

15:32.586 --> 15:34.586
I need you to fake
your own death.

15:34.588 --> 15:36.522
I would never fake
my own death,

15:36.524 --> 15:37.990
I'll give you $2 million.

15:37.992 --> 15:40.392
I'll have someone draft up
a contract right away.

15:40.394 --> 15:42.061
Also...

15:42.063 --> 15:44.463
I will be needing your...

15:44.465 --> 15:46.865
emerald princess crown.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.700
What? No!

15:48.702 --> 15:50.736
That's been in our family
for almost three years.

15:50.738 --> 15:53.472
The crown, or I live forever.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.040
Ugh, fine!

15:55.042 --> 15:57.209
Also, I'd like
your python slippers.

15:57.211 --> 15:58.510
Those won't even fit you.

15:58.512 --> 16:01.346
Oh, they're not for my feet.

16:01.348 --> 16:04.416
Victor is the most vile,
hateful person I've ever met.

16:04.418 --> 16:06.585
You'd think we'd get along.

16:06.587 --> 16:08.487
Well, I'm scared
I'm losing him.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.622
I'm afraid he's going to fall
in love with that weird lady.

16:10.624 --> 16:12.658
Darling, what do I always
tell you?

16:12.660 --> 16:14.993
To not walk in the room when the
green scarf is on the handle.

16:14.995 --> 16:17.162
Yes, but I always tell you
to follow your heart.

16:17.164 --> 16:19.865
My heart says he's mine and that
no one else can have him.

16:19.867 --> 16:22.468
Now, come on, if he doesn't see

16:22.470 --> 16:24.603
what a beautiful,
vacant treasure you are,

16:24.605 --> 16:26.738
then he's a fool.

16:26.740 --> 16:27.773
Thank you.

16:27.775 --> 16:29.942
I always feel better
after our talks.

16:29.944 --> 16:32.911
Oh! Can you fake your death
so I can marry someone else?

16:32.913 --> 16:35.347
Please?
Victor said he would.

16:35.349 --> 16:36.949
Well, of course, darling.

16:36.951 --> 16:38.383
If Victor said so,
I'm happy to do it.

16:38.385 --> 16:40.285
- Really?
- Of course.

16:40.287 --> 16:41.720
Now, just hold still.

16:41.722 --> 16:44.089
I'm gonna make
a real piece of art here.

16:44.091 --> 16:45.424
Ooh, I like that.

16:45.426 --> 16:47.226
Oh, yes. Mm.

16:50.364 --> 16:51.630
My current lover is beautiful,

16:51.632 --> 16:53.065
but she only does
the normal stuff--

16:53.067 --> 16:56.235
missionary, man on top,
possum style.

16:56.237 --> 16:58.504
That's where you lay there
completely still

16:58.506 --> 17:00.472
waiting for the danger to pass.

17:00.474 --> 17:01.907
Should we have
a spring wedding?

17:01.909 --> 17:04.476
I always thought of myself
as a June groom.

17:04.478 --> 17:07.813
Would you mind
not playing with my hair?

17:07.815 --> 17:09.882
I need my own space after sex.

17:09.884 --> 17:13.285
It's-- it's not you,
it's a physiological thing.

17:13.287 --> 17:16.888
It's called
a refractory period.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.202
I want you to know
I heard about what happened,

17:30.204 --> 17:31.870
and I believe you, Garfield.

17:31.872 --> 17:33.272
Oh.

17:33.274 --> 17:36.408
We live in a ravish culture.
It's everywhere we look--

17:36.410 --> 17:40.312
nickelodeons,
daguerreotypes, etchings.

17:40.314 --> 17:43.916
I was saving myself
for a summer at sea.

17:43.918 --> 17:46.451
I know.

17:47.488 --> 17:49.354
Here, you can keep it.

17:49.356 --> 17:51.857
Oh.

17:51.859 --> 17:54.726
This is for me?

17:54.728 --> 17:58.697
Oh, I've never received
a present before.

17:58.699 --> 18:01.633
Oh. Oh, I knew you felt
the same way about me

18:01.635 --> 18:03.168
as I feel about you.

18:03.170 --> 18:06.872
Wait. What way?

18:06.874 --> 18:09.308
Nothing. No ways.

18:09.310 --> 18:12.077
I will cherish this forever.

18:12.079 --> 18:14.246
And I shall name her Towel.

18:23.766 --> 18:25.800
Oh, there you are, Pussy.

18:25.802 --> 18:27.835
I've been looking
all over for you.

18:27.837 --> 18:30.104
Wait.
Are you going somewhere?

18:30.106 --> 18:31.406
Frederick, what do you think?

18:31.408 --> 18:33.541
I think about how pits
get into olives

18:33.543 --> 18:35.543
without making the holes.

18:35.545 --> 18:37.745
But why does it look
like you're leaving?

18:37.747 --> 18:39.013
Aren't we getting married?

18:39.015 --> 18:41.482
Sweetie, I was never
trying to marry you,

18:41.484 --> 18:43.551
I was just trying to get
into your pantaloons.

18:43.553 --> 18:45.887
But you touched me
where I expel my waste!

18:45.889 --> 18:47.789
I've touched a lot of men
in that place,

18:47.791 --> 18:49.791
and I plan to keep on doing it.

18:49.793 --> 18:51.426
You're not leaving.

18:51.428 --> 18:54.195
I know you.
I know my Pussy very well.

18:54.197 --> 18:56.931
You're-- This is-- There's a
hidden sketch artist somewhere.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.232
Where are you?
Come out.

18:58.234 --> 19:00.835
Come out.

19:00.837 --> 19:03.237
Mm, afraid not.

19:03.239 --> 19:04.739
Fine! Go!

19:04.741 --> 19:07.675
Go, Pussy! I don't care.
I don't need you.

19:07.677 --> 19:09.377
I've never needed you!

19:09.379 --> 19:11.212
It's a lie.

19:11.214 --> 19:13.781
Garfield, help me
with my cases.

19:13.783 --> 19:17.218
No, Pussy.
Pussy, Pussy, please!

19:17.220 --> 19:18.820
Please, Pussy!

19:21.858 --> 19:25.460
Whatever happens,
you stay with me, Towel.

19:26.962 --> 19:29.430
Don't go!

19:35.871 --> 19:37.538
I convinced Victor
to leave for six months

19:37.540 --> 19:39.140
so he can be declared
legally dead

19:39.142 --> 19:41.909
and I can have sex
with whoever I want.

19:41.911 --> 19:44.779
Well, you might wonder
why I agreed to leave,

19:44.781 --> 19:46.314
and the answer is simple.

19:46.316 --> 19:47.915
- Our true love.
- Money.

19:47.917 --> 19:51.853
Well, yes, but I married
into this family to stack cash,

19:51.855 --> 19:55.223
and I can't live my goddamn
life on a husband's allowance.

20:09.638 --> 20:11.239
What do you want?

20:11.241 --> 20:13.074
Shouldn't you be with
your creepy girlfriend?

20:13.076 --> 20:14.575
I sent her away.

20:14.577 --> 20:17.178
You did? Leave.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.280
That's right.

20:19.282 --> 20:20.581
I picked you

20:20.583 --> 20:23.818
over that heartless,
manipulative lotharia.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.987
I have never heard
of any of those words.

20:25.989 --> 20:27.588
I don't know. I heard them
from my book reader.

20:27.590 --> 20:29.323
But the point is, I love you.

20:29.325 --> 20:31.993
And I have no emotional
attachment or hurt feelings

20:31.995 --> 20:34.929
from being discarded
and used by Pussy.

20:34.931 --> 20:37.765
Oh, Frederick.

20:39.768 --> 20:43.271
I heard about this thing the--
the girls are doing in Europe.

20:43.273 --> 20:44.572
Divorce?

20:44.574 --> 20:47.875
No.
Uh, let me show you.

20:51.313 --> 20:53.181
Yep, right there.
