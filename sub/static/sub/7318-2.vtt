WEBVTT

00:12.367 --> 00:15.533
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...
DEREK'S MARRIED.

00:15.567 --> 00:16.333
ADDISON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:16.367 --> 00:18.700
YOU HAD A LIFE IN MANHATTAN.
HAD.

00:18.733 --> 00:21.333
BRINGING ADDIE OUT WAS
A BUSINESS DECISION.

00:21.367 --> 00:22.600
NOTHING PERSONAL.
IT IS PERSONAL TO ME.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.333
DON'T SWEAT IT, SHEPHERD. I'LL
ONLY BE YOUR BOSS A FEW DAYS.

00:24.367 --> 00:26.200
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
(Woman) OLIVIA.

00:26.233 --> 00:28.167
YOU AND ALEX?

00:28.200 --> 00:30.133
YOU GAVE ME SYPHILIS?!
AAH!

00:30.167 --> 00:33.400
I THINK IT'S BEST
TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAK.
OH, YOU'RE ENDING THIS.

00:33.433 --> 00:36.767
I'M PREGNANT.
HAVE YOU EVER BOTHERED TO TELL
BURKE ABOUT THE BABY?

00:36.800 --> 00:39.133
I'VE HAD THIS THING FOR MY
ROOMMATE SINCE, LIKE, DAY ONE,

00:39.167 --> 00:40.200
AND I JUST CAN'T TELL HER.

00:40.233 --> 00:42.533
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T CHEAT ON ME.
I CHEATED ON HIM.

00:42.567 --> 00:45.533
IT'S LIKE I WAS DROWNING,
AND YOU SAVED ME.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.767
***

00:50.800 --> 00:52.700
(Meredith)
I HAVE AN AUNT WHO,

00:52.733 --> 00:56.233
WHENEVER SHE POURED ANYTHING
FOR YOU, WOULD SAY, "SAY WHEN."

00:56.267 --> 00:59.033
IT'S NOT US. IT'S THEM.

00:59.067 --> 01:03.167
THEM AND THEIR STUPID
BOY... PENISES.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.633
THEY DIDN'T TELL ME
THEY HAD A WIFE.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.567
THEY GAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING

01:07.600 --> 01:09.667
THAT THEY WERE GOING
TO BREAK UP WITH YOU.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.067
IT'S NOT THAT BURKE
BROKE UP WITH ME.

01:12.067 --> 01:14.733
IT'S HOW HE BROKE UP WITH ME--
LIKE IT WAS BUSINESS,

01:14.767 --> 01:17.467
LIKE IT WAS A BUSINESS TRANS--
LIKE HE'S THE BOSS OF ME?

01:17.500 --> 01:18.767
HE IS THE BOSS OF YOU.

01:18.800 --> 01:22.167
AND WHAT'S WORSE IS
THAT I CARE.
I'M GONNA THROW UP AGAIN.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.733
MY AUNT WOULD SAY, "SAY WHEN,"
AND OF COURSE, WE NEVER DID.

01:26.767 --> 01:30.633
NO. WAIT. FALSE ALARM.

01:30.667 --> 01:33.433
THE PROBLEM IS ESTROGEN.

01:33.467 --> 01:36.333
NO, THE PROBLEM IS TEQUILA.
I USED TO BE ALL BUSINESS.

01:36.367 --> 01:37.467
AND THEN HE GOES
AND GETS ME PREGNANT.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.333
WITH HIS STUPID BOY PENIS.
NOW I'M HAVING HORMONE SURGES.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.500
HE RUINED ME. I'M RUINED.

01:42.533 --> 01:46.800
HE TURNED ME INTO THIS FAT,
STUPID PREGNANT GIRL...

01:46.833 --> 01:49.067
WHO CARES.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.667
ESTROGEN.

01:50.700 --> 01:54.533
PENISES. PENISES, IZZIE.
(door opens)

01:54.567 --> 01:55.733
ESTROGEN, GEORGE.

01:55.767 --> 01:59.067
OKAY. WHAT DID I MISS?

01:59.067 --> 02:00.467
I CAME HOME
TO FULL-ON VOMIT DRAMA.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.200
APPARENTLY, SHE DUMPED DEREK.
AND HER?

02:02.233 --> 02:03.700
(whispers) SHE'S BEEN SLEEPING
WITH BURKE.

02:03.733 --> 02:05.300
OH, I KNEW THAT.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.433
WE DON'T SAY "WHEN" BECAUSE
THERE'S SOMETHING IRRESISTIBLE

02:07.467 --> 02:09.333
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE.

02:09.367 --> 02:11.233
SO YOU REALLY BROKE UP
WITH SHEPHERD?

02:11.267 --> 02:13.067
I FEEL EMPTY.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.200
TWO HOURS OF VOMITING
WILL DO THAT TO YOU.

02:15.233 --> 02:19.600
MORE TEQUILA. MORE LOVE.
MORE ANYTHING. MORE IS BETTER.

02:19.633 --> 02:22.067
NO. I FEEL EMPTY.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.333
YOU'RE LUCKY.
I FEEL PISSED OFF.

02:24.367 --> 02:27.367
***

02:29.500 --> 02:31.100
STOP.

02:31.133 --> 02:32.267
WHAT?

02:32.300 --> 02:33.800
YOU'RE STALKING ME.
STOP IT.

02:33.833 --> 02:36.067
DID WE NOT COMMUNICATE
LAST NIGHT?
YES.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.600
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I WAS SAYING?

02:37.633 --> 02:39.133
YOUR WIFE SCREWED
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

02:39.167 --> 02:40.700
AND THEN FROM THAT POINT ON,

02:40.733 --> 02:42.433
SHE NO LONGER EXISTED
TO ME ANYMORE.

02:42.467 --> 02:43.600
YOU HAD MARITAL AMNESIA.

02:43.633 --> 02:45.500
NO. I BARED MY SOUL
TO YOU LAST NIGHT.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.433
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
HOW CAN THAT NOT BE ENOUGH?

02:47.467 --> 02:49.300
WHEN YOU WAITED TWO MONTHS
TO TELL ME,

02:49.333 --> 02:51.433
AND I HAD TO FIND OUT
BY HER SHOWING UP,

02:51.467 --> 02:54.567
ALL LEGGY AND FABULOUS,
AND TELLING ME HERSELF?

02:54.600 --> 02:57.400
YOU PULLED THE PLUG.
I'M A SINK WITH AN OPEN DRAIN.

02:57.433 --> 03:01.067
ANYTHING YOU SAY RUNS RIGHT OUT.
THERE IS NO "ENOUGH."

03:02.700 --> 03:04.533
SHE PROBABLY COULD HAVE
PICKED A BETTER METAPHOR.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.533
GIVE HER A BREAK.
SHE'S GOT A HANGOVER.
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.633
DR. SHEPHERD.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.067
DR. BURKE.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.667
WE HAVE AN ORGAN DONOR
COMING IN

03:11.700 --> 03:14.200
THIS AFTERNOON
FROM WILKESON GENERAL.

03:14.233 --> 03:15.300
WE'RE DOING THE HARVEST...
COMMENDABLE.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.167
IN O.R.1 AT 4.
I'M IN O.R.1 AT 4.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.500
YOUR SURGERY'S NON-CRITICAL.
YOU CAN'T BUMP ME.

03:18.533 --> 03:19.833
YOU'LL BE FIRST UP TOMORROW.
AS CHIEF...

03:19.867 --> 03:21.067
INTERIM CHIEF.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.767
I CAN.
BUMP SOMEBODY ELSE.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.200
YOU'RE IN THE O.R. WE NEED.

03:24.233 --> 03:25.733
WHY DON'T THEY DO THE HARVEST
AT WILKESON?

03:25.767 --> 03:27.667
SMALL FACILITY IN THE BOONIES--
A DOC IN THE BOX.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.233
WE HAVE THE LOCATION,
THE AIRPORT NEARBY

03:29.267 --> 03:31.167
AND THE STAFF.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.633
YOUR SURGERY IS RESCHEDULED.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.467
(elevator dings)

03:35.800 --> 03:38.767
"MINE'S BIGGER THAN YOURS."

03:38.800 --> 03:41.133
WHIP IT OUT.
I'LL MEASURE.

03:41.167 --> 03:43.667
SHUT UP, ALEX.
SHUT UP, ALEX.

03:47.833 --> 03:49.733
MALE, 55, VICTIM OF
A HEAD-ON COLLISION.

03:49.767 --> 03:51.667
G.C.S. IS 3,
DEPRESSED SKULL FRACTURE,

03:51.700 --> 03:54.567
MULTIPLE INTERNAL INJURIES,
A.C.L.S. PROTOCOL STARTED,

03:54.600 --> 03:57.400
BUT HIS VEIN'S BLUE SO WE'VE
BEEN PUSHING MEDS DOWN THE TUBE.

03:57.433 --> 03:59.567
P.E.A. ON ARRIVAL.
HOW LONG'S HE BEEN DOWN?

03:59.600 --> 04:02.233
WE'VE BEEN DOING C.P.R.
FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

04:02.267 --> 04:04.400
IT TOOK FIRE 20 MINUTES
TO GET HIM OUT OF THE CAR.

04:04.433 --> 04:07.100
HE'S PRETTY MUCH GONE.
NO, HE'S NOT GONE
UNTIL WE SAY HE'S GONE.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.067
KEEP CODING. O'MALLEY,
GET HIM INTO A BAY AND SAVE HIM.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.067
BUT HE'S DEAD.
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

04:11.100 --> 04:13.367
HE'S NOT DEAD UNTIL
WE SAY HE'S DEAD.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.533
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO,
SO DO IT.

04:15.567 --> 04:17.500
GREY, YOU'RE ON THIS, TOO.
MOVE.

04:17.533 --> 04:20.400
WE'VE GOT THREE MORE VICTIMS
IN THE OTHER CAR COMING IN.

04:20.433 --> 04:22.300
LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.767
HE'S DEAD.

04:30.633 --> 04:33.500
HEY, OLIVIA.

04:33.533 --> 04:34.767
PULSELESS V TACH.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.300
LINE'S IN.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.700
OKAY, CHARGE TO 200.

04:38.733 --> 04:40.767
200.
CLEAR.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.067
(monitor beeps)

04:43.067 --> 04:44.767
PUSH ONE OF EPI.
LET'S GO AGAIN. CHARGE 300.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.667
SERIOUSLY?

04:47.700 --> 04:51.233
I THINK THAT'S WHAT DR. BAILEY
WANTS YOU TO DO, GEORGE.

04:51.267 --> 04:54.433
DR. O'MALLEY.

04:54.467 --> 04:57.067
IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS,
DR. O'MALLEY.

04:57.100 --> 05:00.333
OKAY, THEN LET'S
CHARGE TO 300.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.567
300.
CLEAR.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.200
MALE, 46, UNRESTRAINED DRIVER
OF THE CAR THAT JUMPED LANES.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.633
B.P. 80 OVER PALP,
TACHYCARDIC, LAST PULSE--138.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.067
GOT 2 LITERS L.R. RUNNING
WIDE OPEN.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.633
SIGNIFICANT ABDOMINAL
TENDERNESS.
ANY HISTORY?

05:12.667 --> 05:14.300
WIFE SAYS HE'S GOT A BAD LIVER.
HE'S ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.233
ABDOMEN'S RIGID.
OKAY, HANDS OFF.

05:16.267 --> 05:19.067
WE NEED TO PAGE
BURKE AND DOMNER.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.567
PREP THIS GUY
FOR THE O.R. WHO WANTS IT?
I DO!

05:20.600 --> 05:21.733
I DO!
I DO!

05:21.767 --> 05:23.800
NO, YOU'RE TOO LATE.
STEVENS, TAKE IT.
YES!

05:23.833 --> 05:27.300
KAREV, TAKE THE BOY.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.267
YANG, THE MOM.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.800
I WANNA BE LOOKING
AT THEIR FILMS IN 15 MINUTES.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.367
(knock on glass)

05:33.400 --> 05:36.333
WE GOT ONE MORE
FOR YOU.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.467
WHAT IS IT?
THAT GUY.

05:38.500 --> 05:42.100
HE WAS IN THE ACCIDENT?
NO, BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.067
HE'S NOT TELLING US
WHAT HE INGESTED,

05:44.067 --> 05:45.733
BUT THE FILMS LOOK LIKE
HE'S PACKING.

05:45.767 --> 05:48.300
CAN'T PEOPLE FIGURE OUT
A BETTER WAY TO MOVE DRUGS?

05:48.333 --> 05:50.567
GREY? OH,
PERICARDIOCENTESIS, GOOD.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.600
ANY RESPONSE?

05:52.633 --> 05:54.533
OKAY, UH, ALL RIGHT,
YOU GUYS, CAN...

05:54.567 --> 05:56.067
SHOULD I CALL IT?

05:56.067 --> 05:58.067
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO NEXT,
O'MALLEY?

05:58.067 --> 05:59.300
I WOULD CALL IT.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.400
TO SAVE HIM.

06:01.433 --> 06:04.333
UH, UM...
A PERICARDIAL WINDOW?

06:04.367 --> 06:06.400
EXCELLENT. DO IT.
GREY, YOU'RE DONE HERE.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.800
I GOT A BOWEL OBSTRUCTION
FOR YOU.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.133
FUN.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.733
AT LEAST YOUR PATIENT'S
STILL ALIVE.

06:16.233 --> 06:18.633
WHAT NEXT, DOCTOR?

06:22.400 --> 06:26.200
***

06:26.233 --> 06:30.133
* NOBODY KNOWS WHERE
THEY MIGHT END UP *

06:30.167 --> 06:32.667
* NOBODY KNOWS

06:40.733 --> 06:42.633
* OH, OH

06:42.667 --> 06:46.433
* SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW *

06:48.633 --> 06:52.167
OKAY, STOP,
THAT'S IT.
THAT IS NOT IT.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.533
COME ON, WILL YOU STOP IT?
THAT'S IT.

06:53.567 --> 06:56.067
THAT IS NOT IT, RICHARD,
HOLD STILL.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.233
HOW CAN I HOLD STILL
WHEN YOU'RE POKING ME?
I HAVE TO POKE YOU
TO DISCHARGE YOU.

06:58.267 --> 07:00.367
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE WANTS TO BE DISCHARGED?

07:00.400 --> 07:02.300
DEREK, DON'T YOU KNOW
THIS HOSPITAL WILL CRUMBLE

07:02.333 --> 07:04.567
UNLESS RICHARD'S HERE
HOLDING UP THE WALLS?

07:04.600 --> 07:07.367
ADELE, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.100
OH, YOU ARE IN FIVE KINDS
OF TROUBLE, MISTER MAN.

07:10.133 --> 07:12.067
YOU HAD BRAIN SURGERY
AND DIDN'T TELL ME?

07:12.067 --> 07:13.733
IT WAS JUST
A SMALL PROCEDURE.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.633
IT WAS BRAIN SURGERY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO
RUIN YOUR VACATION.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.567
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT A VACATION IS.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.067
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
HOW TO RUIN IT?

07:19.100 --> 07:22.467
WELL, ANYWAY...

07:22.500 --> 07:24.433
HOW DID YOU FIND--
YOU CALLED MY WIFE?

07:24.467 --> 07:26.400
YOU CALLED MINE.

07:26.433 --> 07:28.667
LOOK, HAVING SOMEONE HOME
WITH YOU IS THE ONLY WAY

07:28.700 --> 07:31.200
I'M LETTING YOU
OUT OF HERE TODAY.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.533
FINE.

07:32.567 --> 07:35.733
I THOUGHT I SAW A FABULOUS
LOOKING WOMAN WALK BY.

07:35.767 --> 07:38.300
ADDISON, YES, SEE!
HI.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.600
I TOLD RICHARD
I KNEW YOU AND DEREK

07:40.633 --> 07:43.400
WOULD GET BACK TOGETHER.
UH, ACTUALLY,
I'M HERE ON A CASE.

07:43.433 --> 07:44.567
ADDISON AND I ARE OVER,
ADELE.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.367
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DIVORCED.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.567
PRACTICALLY DIVORCED.
YOU'VE HAD COUNSELING?

07:47.600 --> 07:50.567
WE HAD ADULTERY.
THAT WAS ENOUGH.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.067
I'LL CALL YOU LATER,
OKAY?
MM-HMM.

07:54.067 --> 07:57.167
YOU SHOULD GIVE HER
A CHANCE, DEREK.

07:57.200 --> 08:01.067
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
KEEP HIM IN LINE.

08:06.833 --> 08:09.600
MY MOM'S OKAY, RIGHT?

08:09.633 --> 08:12.433
YEAH, YEAH, I THINK SO.

08:12.467 --> 08:15.267
THEY'D BEEN FIGHTING
AT BREAKFAST.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.300
DAD GETS UGLY
WHEN HE GETS LIKE THAT.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.167
RAN THREE STOPLIGHTS BEFORE
WE EVEN GOT ON THE FREEWAY.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.700
MY HUSBAND BOB'S
A REALLY GOOD DRIVER.

08:26.733 --> 08:28.667
SOME GUY IN A PICKUP
CUTS US OFF.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.567
SAFE, YOU KNOW? I THINK
HE SAW SOMETHING IN THE--

08:30.600 --> 08:32.700
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND--
MY DAD JUST LOST IT.

08:32.733 --> 08:35.267
AND SWERVED TO AVOID IT.
HE STARTED CHASING THE GUY.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.767
THE CRASH--IT JUST--
IT JUST CAME OUTTA NOWHERE.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.333
BLASTING THROUGH TRAFFIC.

08:40.367 --> 08:42.367
WE'D BEEN HAVING
A REALLY NICE MORNING.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.133
ONE MINUTE, EVERYTHING'S FINE.
AND THE NEXT--
SCREAMING AT HIM.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.833
I COULD SEE THE GUY'S FACE
BEFORE WE HIT.
NEXT THING I KNOW--

08:47.867 --> 08:50.733
WE'RE UPSIDE DOWN ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FREEWAY.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.733
DO THE SURGEONS KNOW THAT BOB
HAS A BAD LIVER?
THEY KNOW.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.533
HOW'S SCOTTY?

08:54.567 --> 08:56.667
YOUR SON'S IN THE NEXT ROOM
GETTING X-RAYED.

08:56.700 --> 08:57.767
MY DAD--HE--

08:57.800 --> 09:00.600
HE'S IN SURGERY.
IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

09:00.633 --> 09:03.667
YEAH, WELL...

09:03.700 --> 09:08.533
I GUESS THE SON OF A BITCH
GOT WHAT HE DESERVED.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.333
WHAT MAKES PEOPLE THINK
THEY DON'T NEED SEATBELTS?

09:16.100 --> 09:17.833
MY END IS DONE.

09:17.867 --> 09:19.767
WELL, THE BOWEL'S A MESS,
BUT IT'S REPAIRABLE.

09:19.800 --> 09:24.467
IT'S A LOT OF WORK, BUT I DON'T
SEE THE POINT WITH THIS LIVER.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.367
WHAT DO YOU SEE, DR. STEVENS?

09:26.400 --> 09:29.300
UH, DEEP LACERATION,
BLEEDING.
WHAT ELSE?

09:29.333 --> 09:31.100
IT'S HARD AND PALE--
CIRRHOTIC.

09:31.133 --> 09:32.767
THEY SAID HE'S ON
THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.433
DOES HE HAVE FAMILY
HERE, STEVENS?
A WIFE AND SON.

09:35.467 --> 09:39.067
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA
ROLL YOU OVER. GENTLY.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.567
OH!

09:40.600 --> 09:42.600
THIS LOOKS PRETTY BAD.
HOW DID YOU GET THIS?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.067
WELL, WE HIT SO HARD.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.833
I DON'T THINK THIS IS FROM
THE COLLISION.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.433
IT LOOKS
A COUPLE OF WEEKS OLD.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.433
WHERE ARE YOU?

09:59.467 --> 10:01.200
I CAN SEE HIS HEART.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.767
HIS HEART
THAT'S NOT BEATING.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.700
OKAY, OPEN THE PERICARDIUM
AND ASPIRATE.

10:05.733 --> 10:08.367
IF THE HEART'S STILL NOT
BEATING, CLOSE AND CALL IT.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.433
WHAT? YOU THINK WE'RE
DEFILING THIS MAN'S BODY?

10:11.467 --> 10:14.333
WELL, WE'RE CERTAINLY
DOING MORE--

10:14.367 --> 10:16.467
THAN WHAT?

10:16.500 --> 10:19.800
IF THEY'RE DEAD OR DYING WHEN
THEY COME THROUGH THOSE DOORS,

10:19.833 --> 10:21.833
YOU HUMP, AND HUMP HARD.
WHY?

10:21.867 --> 10:23.733
FOR THE EXPERIENCE.

10:23.767 --> 10:26.067
NO, WHAT ELSE?
THERE'S SOMETHING MORE.

10:27.667 --> 10:31.600
YOU THINK ON THAT.
IT'LL COME TO YOU.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.600
YOU KNOW, MR. HUBBLE,

10:39.633 --> 10:41.533
YOU MIGHT MAKE THINGS
A LITTLE EASIER ON YOURSELF

10:41.567 --> 10:43.467
IF YOU WOULD JUST TELL US
WHAT YOU'VE INGESTED.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.433
WE'LL KNOW ANYWAY
ONCE WE SEE YOUR FILMS.

10:45.467 --> 10:48.200
YOU HAVE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL FEATURES.

10:48.233 --> 10:50.033
THEY'RE DELICATE.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.100
ALMOST PORCELAIN.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.733
MR. HUBBLE, WHATEVER YOU'VE
INGESTED COULD KILL YOU.

10:53.767 --> 10:55.667
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO TELL ME

10:55.700 --> 10:57.433
WHAT'S GOT YOU
BLOCKED UP INSIDE?

10:57.467 --> 11:00.467
IT MIGHT OFFEND YOU.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.533
IS IT DRUGS?
IT'S NOT DRUGS.

11:01.567 --> 11:03.233
MR. HUBBLE...

11:03.267 --> 11:04.500
I PROMISE.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.400
IT'S NOT DRUGS.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.833
OKAY.

11:07.867 --> 11:11.133
WELL, GOOD,
I'M GLAD IT'S NOT DRUGS.

11:11.167 --> 11:12.633
IT'S DRUGS.

11:12.667 --> 11:16.567
LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST TEN BALLOONS
IN HIS BOWEL.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.667
MY GUESS COCAINE.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.667
SCOTT SEIBERT, 18, NO FRACTURES
OR INTERNAL BLEEDING.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.600
GOT PRETTY LUCKY.
RECOMMENDATION?

11:23.633 --> 11:25.633
KEEP OVERNIGHT
FOR OBSERVATION.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.600
DAMN.
LEA SEIBERT, 43,
MULTIPLE HEALED FRACTURES

11:29.633 --> 11:32.333
ON HER CLAVICLE AND HUMERUS,
HER THIRD AND FOURTH RIB.

11:32.367 --> 11:35.733
SHE'S EITHER A BULL RIDER
OR SHE'S ABUSED.

11:35.767 --> 11:38.100
KID SAID THE ACCIDENT
WAS ROAD RAGE.

11:38.133 --> 11:40.067
HIS OLD MAN GOT CUT OFF
IN TRAFFIC, WENT BALLISTIC.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.733
WELL, THAT'S NOT
THE STORY I GOT.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.633
SHE HAS A LARGE, YELLOWING
BRUISE OVER HER RIGHT KIDNEY

11:43.667 --> 11:46.067
TENDER TO PALPITATION.

11:46.067 --> 11:47.800
SAID SHE GOT IT FROM A FALL
LAST WEEK. SHE'S BLEEDING.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.733
PERINEPHRIC HEMATOMA.
WHAT DO YOU DO?

11:50.767 --> 11:53.600
IT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.
WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON IT.

11:53.633 --> 11:57.200
SHE NEEDS, UH, BED REST
AND A SHRINK.

11:57.233 --> 11:59.067
IT'S DRUGS.

11:59.067 --> 12:02.100
STUPID, STUPID,
STUPID.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.800
ONE BURST AND HE'S DEAD
IN FIVE MINUTES.

12:04.833 --> 12:06.700
OKAY, WHAT DO WE DO?
RUN HIS BOWEL.

12:06.733 --> 12:08.800
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YANG?

12:08.833 --> 12:11.500
UH, RUNNING THE BOWEL ENTAILS
REMOVING ALL 36 FEET

12:11.533 --> 12:13.433
OF THE INTESTINE FROM
THE BODY CAVITY,

12:13.467 --> 12:15.367
HAND SEARCHING FOR THE BALLOONS
AND THEN CUTTING THEM OUT.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.333
GREY, BOOK AN O.R.
YANG, KAREV, YOU'RE IN.

12:17.367 --> 12:20.067
I NEED ALL THE HANDS
I CAN GET.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.833
ARE YOU SURE
THEY'RE BALLOONS?

12:21.867 --> 12:24.733
YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THEY'RE NOT BALLOONS?

12:24.767 --> 12:27.767
THIS ONE HERE'S
GOT A FACE.

12:29.533 --> 12:31.633
SO DOES THAT ONE.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.700
THEY ALL DO.

12:33.733 --> 12:36.500
I'LL BE DAMNED.
THEY'RE JUDYS.

12:36.533 --> 12:39.367
JUDYS?

12:39.400 --> 12:44.100
HE SWALLOWED THE HEADS
OF TEN JUDY DOLLS.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.200
EWW.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.367
MY MOTHER USED TO BUY ME
JUDY DOLLS--

12:55.400 --> 12:57.800
MANHATTAN JUDY, SURFER JUDY
DISCO JUDY.
I ALWAYS WANTED ONE.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.767
I DISSECTED THEM,
CUT OFF THEIR ARMS,

12:59.800 --> 13:01.667
AND SHAVED THEIR HEADS.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.833
SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A SICK
AND TWISTED STORY BEHIND THIS.

13:02.867 --> 13:04.733
THEY'RE SEXIST, DISTORTED
DEVIL TOYS

13:04.767 --> 13:07.567
THAT CREATE UNREALISTIC
IMAGE EXPECTATIONS

13:07.600 --> 13:09.700
CATERING TO THE PORN-DRIVEN
MINDS OF MEN.

13:09.733 --> 13:11.767
YOU SWALLOW A BITTER PILL
THIS MORNING, YANG?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.700
THEY'RE DOLLS.

13:13.733 --> 13:16.200
GREY, CALL FOR A PSYCH CONSULT.

13:16.233 --> 13:19.067
AND THEN SEE
IF HE HAS FAMILY.
DO I STILL BOOK
THE O.R.?

13:19.067 --> 13:20.833
BLOCKED BOWELS BECOME
NECROTIC BOWELS.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.667
CHECK WITH DR. BURKE,
SEE IF WE CAN BUMP SOMEONE.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.733
THOSE JUDY'S GOTTA
COME OUT TODAY.

13:25.767 --> 13:28.400
HANGING ANOTHER B-NEG.
HE'S GOING THROUGH
A LOT OF BLOOD.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.833
WHAT'S THE WORD
FROM U.N.O.S.?

13:29.867 --> 13:32.533
HE'S ON THE LIST, BUT THEY
DON'T HAVE A LIVER FOR HIM.

13:32.567 --> 13:34.467
THE LIST WON'T HELP HIM NOW.
WE CAN WORK ALL DAY,

13:34.500 --> 13:36.400
BUT THIS LIVER
WON'T STOP BLEEDING.

13:36.433 --> 13:39.200
AND IT WON'T SUPPORT
HIS RECOVERY FROM SURGERY.

13:39.233 --> 13:41.300
WHAT ABOUT THE DONOR
FROM WILKESON THAT'S COMING IN?

13:41.333 --> 13:43.167
THAT LIVER'S ALREADY
BEEN COMMITTED.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.767
MR. SIEBERT'S ONLY HOPE
IS A FAMILY DONOR.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.700
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL IT.
NO USE IN TYING UP AN O.R.

13:47.733 --> 13:50.067
IF WE'RE JUST POSTPONING
THE INEVITABLE.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.500
HOW MUCH WORK DO YOU HAVE HERE
TO COMPLETE, DR. DOMNER?
OH, MAYBE SIX HOURS.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.067
THEN THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME WE
HAVE TO FIND HIM A NEW LIVER.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.067
YOU'RE THE CHIEF.

13:57.067 --> 14:00.400
***

14:05.533 --> 14:07.433
ANY FAMILY MEMBERS WAITING?

14:07.467 --> 14:09.767
STILL TRYING TO REACH THEM.
GOOD.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.833
I MEAN, NOT GOOD THAT
WE HAVEN'T REACHED THEM.

14:11.867 --> 14:13.767
IT'S JUST GOOD
I DON'T HAVE TO...

14:13.800 --> 14:16.800
IT'S ALWAYS HARD.
YEAH.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.233
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALEX.

14:24.267 --> 14:27.133
THAT'S FINE. IT'S GOOD,
YOU KNOW.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.367
NO NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.800
YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAD SEX
WITH HIM BEFORE YOU, NOT DURING.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.733
BECAUSE WHEN YOU AND I
WERE HAVING SEX--

14:34.767 --> 14:36.267
I UNDERSTAND.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.733
I JUST WANTED
TO CLEAR THE AIR.
OH.

14:38.767 --> 14:40.800
IT'S CLEAR.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.667
PERFECTLY CLEAR--
OKAY.

14:45.833 --> 14:47.733
AND ABOUT THE SYPHILIS.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.667
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.200
IT'S JUST, I MEAN, I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD IT.

14:52.233 --> 14:54.833
I SHOULD'VE. I'M A NURSE.
I MEAN, THERE WAS THE SORE.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.700
AND I WAS ALL ITCHY.

14:56.733 --> 14:59.700
OKAY, YOU KNOW, I, UH,
GOT IT.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.067
YOU KNOW,
THINGS HAPPEN.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.600
THEY--THEY REALLY DO.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.533
THINGS YOU WISH
YOU COULD CHANGE.

15:05.567 --> 15:07.400
YEAH.
(pager beeps)

15:08.367 --> 15:10.633
IT'S THE CHIEF.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.133
I GOTTA TAKE THIS.
SURE.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.133
GEORGE.

15:15.167 --> 15:17.100
YOU HAVE TO CALL IT.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.500
CALL IT?

15:18.533 --> 15:21.067
HIM.

15:21.067 --> 15:24.200
OH, UM,
TIME OF DEATH 1:48.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.300
I GOT IT.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.800
THIS GUY CAME IN
THIS MORNING

15:46.833 --> 15:48.733
WITH TEN JUDY DOLL HEADS
IN HIS ABDOMEN.

15:48.767 --> 15:51.533
IS THAT SOME KIND OF SICK
OR WHAT?

15:51.567 --> 15:53.467
I MEAN, WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT IT

15:53.500 --> 15:55.367
THOSE THINGS
CAN'T BE THAT EASY TO SWALLOW.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.333
IF THEY STILL GOT
THEIR HAIR ON THEM,

15:57.367 --> 15:58.500
THAT'S SOME BAD SPAGHETTI.

15:58.533 --> 16:01.567
THAT DUDE'S CRAPPING TOYS.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.800
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE
YOU CAN HIDE.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.567
IGNORE THE SHOUTING,
THE SCREAMING,

16:16.600 --> 16:18.667
PRETEND LIKE YOU'RE
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.333
THEN WHEN
YOU GET OLDER, BIGGER,

16:23.367 --> 16:26.633
YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING.

16:26.667 --> 16:30.200
SOMETHING TO STOP IT.
YOU KNOW, TO PROTECT HER.

16:30.233 --> 16:33.067
AND WHEN YOU CAN'T,

16:33.067 --> 16:35.300
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO TO BE ANGRIER AT--

16:35.333 --> 16:38.067
YOUR OLD MAN
OR YOURSELF.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.100
USUALLY IT'S YOURSELF.

16:43.833 --> 16:46.367
DID SHE TELL YOU?

16:46.400 --> 16:49.200
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO
IT'S ALL OVER HER FILMS.

16:49.233 --> 16:51.300
HE'S NOT BEATING YOU,
IS HE?

16:51.333 --> 16:53.067
NO, JUST HER.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.067
(elevator dings)

16:54.100 --> 16:57.700
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
ABOUT THE ANGER?

16:57.733 --> 17:00.667
ME? I THINK ABOUT THE GUY
WHO EATS DOLL HEADS.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.200
HE'S GOT PROBLEMS.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.433
HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU GUYS.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.733
IT'S MY FATHER.

17:11.700 --> 17:14.167
BOB LIKED HIS BEERS.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.300
HIS LIVER STARTED TO FAIL
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.233
HE QUIT DRINKING, AND WE PUT HIM
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

17:20.267 --> 17:22.067
BUT HIS BLOOD TYPE--
"B" NEGATIVE.

17:22.067 --> 17:25.633
THERE JUST AREN'T
THAT MANY AVAILABLE.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.667
THEY SUGGESTED
A FAMILY MEMBER.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.567
ANY LUCK?

17:30.600 --> 17:34.767
MY SON.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.600
THEY SAID SCOTTY'S A GOOD MATCH.
HE'S 18.

17:37.633 --> 17:40.067
FAMILY MEMBERS SHOULDN'T DO IT
OUT OF OBLIGATION.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.100
IT'S A RISKY OPERATION.

17:41.133 --> 17:44.200
SCOTTY'S HAD COUNSELING.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.767
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST DON'T
LET YOU DO IT.

17:48.267 --> 17:51.533
HE HASN'T MADE
HIS MIND UP YET, YOU KNOW.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.767
I MEAN, WE ACTUALLY HAVE
A DATE SET FOR THE SURGERY.

17:53.800 --> 17:57.233
I JUST... I JUST DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO PRESSURE HIM.

17:57.267 --> 17:59.333
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T.

17:59.367 --> 18:01.400
OH, GOD. OH, GOD,
I DON'T WANNA LOSE BOB.

18:01.433 --> 18:03.367
LOOK, WE'LL GIVE YOUR SON
AS MUCH TIME AS WE CAN

18:03.400 --> 18:06.633
TO MAKE A DECISION,
OKAY?

18:13.100 --> 18:14.833
WOULD YOU CARE
TO EXPLAIN?

18:14.867 --> 18:18.067
SEIBERT IS A WIFE BEATER.
HER FILMS SHOW YEARS OF ABUSE.

18:18.067 --> 18:19.667
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
MULTIPLE FRACTURES.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.767
SHE HAS A KIDNEY BLEED FROM
A BEATING SHE TOOK LAST WEEK.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.700
PLUS IT WAS--
IT WAS HIS ROAD RAGE

18:23.733 --> 18:26.567
THAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.
THE GUY IN THE OTHER CAR DIED.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.333
AND THAT MEANS WHAT?

18:28.367 --> 18:30.267
NO HEROIC MEASURES?
WE LEAVE HIM ON THE TABLE?

18:30.300 --> 18:32.800
WELL,
IF IT WERE UP TO ME--
THINK LIKE A SURGEON,
DR. YANG.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.300
WE HAVE A DYING PATIENT
AND A LIVER THAT COULD SAVE HIM.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.233
WELL, THIS IS
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

18:37.267 --> 18:41.067
FOR SOCIAL WORKERS, YES.
FOR THE FAMILY. NOT FOR YOU.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.833
IT ISN'T UP TO YOU.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.500
YEAH, YOU MADE THAT
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

18:44.533 --> 18:46.667
WELL, I'M GLAD WE HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.333
YEAH, I'M SURE YOU ARE.

18:58.133 --> 18:59.533
THE DONOR FROM WILKESON?

18:59.567 --> 19:01.700
SHOULD BE HERE AT 3.
HARVEST TEAM'S ON THEIR WAY IN.

19:01.733 --> 19:04.367
I ALSO NEED TO TOUCH BASE
WITH THE TRANSPLANT CENTER

19:04.400 --> 19:05.567
ABOUT SEIBERT'S GETTING
HIS SON'S LIVER.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.500
DR. BURKE.

19:07.533 --> 19:09.700
DR. BAILEY NEEDS AN O.R.
AND THEY'RE ALL BOOKED.
FOR?

19:09.733 --> 19:11.500
AN EMERGENT
BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.267
DRUGS?

19:15.300 --> 19:17.433
TEN JUDY DOLL HEADS.

19:17.467 --> 19:19.200
SERIOUSLY?
YES.

19:19.233 --> 19:21.800
I CAN SEE
THEIR LITTLE FACES.

19:21.833 --> 19:24.567
"HELP! LET ME OUT!"

19:24.600 --> 19:26.133
BUMP WARNER'S HERNIA IN 1.

19:26.167 --> 19:28.700
BUT DON'T TELL HIM
WHAT WE'RE REMOVING.

19:28.733 --> 19:30.667
THANK YOU.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.433
IF HE CAN'T BE HERE
OBSESSING,

19:36.467 --> 19:39.167
HE WANTS STUFF
TO OBSESS WITH AT HOME.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.267
I'LL BE DONE AND OUT OF YOUR WAY
IN A MOMENT.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.700
INTERN TIME CARDS--SIGN.

19:45.233 --> 19:47.133
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING,
ISN'T IT?

19:47.167 --> 19:51.633
SOME EMERGENCY SURGERY, SOME
ANNOYING ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.600
BEING CHIEF IS A LOT LIKE
BEING AN INTERN.

19:53.633 --> 19:55.667
THE WORK NEVER STOPS.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.700
WHEN I FOUND OUT
RICHARD HAD A TUMOR,

19:58.733 --> 20:01.133
YOU KNOW WHAT I FELT?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.033
RELIEVED.

20:03.067 --> 20:08.167
I WAS HOPING HE WOULD FINALLY
BE FORCED TO RETIRE.

20:08.200 --> 20:12.233
AH, THAT HAS YOUR ATTENTION,
DOESN'T IT?

20:12.267 --> 20:15.700
HOW WE BOTH WOULD LIKE
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

20:15.733 --> 20:20.767
I COULD FINALLY BOOK
A VACATION FOR TWO.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.033
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE PERFECT
FOR THIS JOB, PRESTON--

20:24.067 --> 20:28.167
UNATTACHED, OBSESSIVE.
THIS HOSPITAL, THIS JOB--

20:28.200 --> 20:30.000
IT'S ENOUGH FOR YOU,
ISN'T IT?

20:38.433 --> 20:40.433
IT HAS TO BE TODAY?

20:40.467 --> 20:42.633
HE WON'T MAKE IT OFF THE TABLE
WITH HIS OWN LIVER.

20:42.667 --> 20:46.133
HE'S BLEEDING A LOT.

20:46.167 --> 20:50.567
WHEN YOU GET COUNSELING,
THEY TELL YOU NOT TO FORCE IT--

20:50.600 --> 20:52.733
THE DECISION, YOU KNOW?

20:52.767 --> 20:54.333
ONE DAY, ONE MOMENT--

20:54.367 --> 20:58.167
YOU'LL JUST KNOW
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.233
IT SHOULD BE EASY, RIGHT?
HE'S MY FATHER.

21:00.267 --> 21:02.400
WELL,
IT'S A TOUGH OPERATION.

21:02.433 --> 21:04.333
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE
A BIG CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE.

21:04.367 --> 21:05.833
THE UPSIDE IS
THAT THE LIVER'S

21:05.867 --> 21:07.700
THE ONLY ORGAN
THAT REGENERATES ITSELF.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.633
I MEAN, THEY'RE GONNA ONLY
TAKE HALF OF YOURS

21:09.667 --> 21:11.567
AND IT'LL BE BACK TO NORMAL SIZE
IN TWO MONTHS.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.500
YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE RUNNING
ANY MARATHONS ANYTIME SOON--

21:13.533 --> 21:16.833
DR. STEVENS, CAN I SEE YOU
OUTSIDE FOR A MOMENT?

21:16.867 --> 21:18.800
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
YOU'RE DOING A SALES PITCH.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.733
THE RECIPIENT IS YOUR PATIENT.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.767
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING
TO THE DONOR.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.700
THE RECIPIENT
IS HIS FATHER,

21:24.733 --> 21:26.633
WHO HE'S GONNA LOSE
IF HE DOESN'T MAKE A DECISION.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.567
AND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

21:28.600 --> 21:30.500
BELIEVE ME,
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT.

21:30.533 --> 21:33.700
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THAT KID'S HEAD.

21:33.733 --> 21:36.133
NONE.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.733
CALL THREE TIMES A DAY.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.667
DO NOT CALL
THREE TIMES A DAY.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.233
AND IF MY WIFE DOESN'T
PUT YOU THROUGH--
I WON'T PUT YOU THROUGH.

21:45.267 --> 21:47.067
KEEP CALLING
UNTIL SHE DOES.
YES, SIR.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.533
HE'S NOT TALKING.
IT COULD BE PICA.

21:49.567 --> 21:51.600
BUT DOUBTFUL
FOR A MAN HIS AGE.

21:51.633 --> 21:53.333
MAYBE AN OEDIPAL COMPLEX

21:53.367 --> 21:55.267
OR IDOLIZATION OF THE DOLLS
AS PARTNERS.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.733
OR IT COULD BE
THAT HE SIMPLY ENJOYS IT.

21:56.767 --> 21:59.433
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN
A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS

21:59.467 --> 22:01.267
IN STRANGE PLACES, BUT HOW
DOES HE ENJOY THIS?
HE'D ENJOY THEM
WHEN THEY CAME OUT.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.767
I DIDN'T NEED
TO HEAR THAT.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.400
DR. GREY, MAY I SPEAK
WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT?

22:06.433 --> 22:08.733
DON'T LOOK AT ME
FOR HELP.

22:08.767 --> 22:12.067
I ASSUME HE TOLD YOU
WHY HE LEFT ME?

22:12.067 --> 22:14.067
DR. SHEPHERD,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

22:14.100 --> 22:15.833
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ME.

22:15.867 --> 22:17.767
REALLY?

22:17.800 --> 22:20.500
SO YOU DIDN'T
TAKE HIM BACK? GOOD GIRL.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.433
AND IN THE FUTURE, I'D
APPRECIATE IT IF WE COULD

22:22.467 --> 22:25.400
KEEP OUR RELATIONSHIP
STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.

22:25.433 --> 22:26.767
MEREDITH?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.767
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO
DESPERATE THINGS

22:28.800 --> 22:31.300
TO GET SOMEONE'S
ATTENTION.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.800
THERE ARE TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.633
(Cristina) THE FATHER'S
AN ALCOHOLIC WIFE BEATER.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.567
I MEAN, IT SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE A QUESTION.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.500
YEAH, BUT IF YOU COULD SAVE
SOMEBODY AND DIDN'T,

22:43.533 --> 22:45.600
WOULDN'T YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU WERE COMMITTING MURDER?

22:45.633 --> 22:47.667
OH, YEAH, LIKE THE GUY DID WHEN
HE CRASHED INTO GEORGE'S D.O.A.?

22:47.700 --> 22:50.267
HE'S THE KILLER,
NOT THE SON.
OH, THAT IS SICK.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.300
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

22:52.333 --> 22:55.367
UGH. LOOK, SEE JUDY FLY.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.300
HEY, GEORGE.
HEY.

22:57.333 --> 23:00.333
***

23:05.633 --> 23:07.400
WHAT?

23:07.433 --> 23:08.400
GEORGE...

23:08.433 --> 23:10.433
SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE UP
WITH YOU.

23:10.467 --> 23:13.133
YOU SHOULD GO EAT
WITH HER.
NO.
NO, I SHOULDN'T.

23:13.167 --> 23:15.167
SHE'S CUTE AND SHE LIKES YOU.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.267
YOU SHOULDN'T LET A LITTLE
SYPH GET IN THE WAY.
IT'S NOT THE SYPH.

23:17.300 --> 23:19.267
OH, SO THE SYPH.
IT IS NOT THE SYPH.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.100
THEN WHAT IS IT?

23:22.133 --> 23:23.767
OH.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.800
WHAT?

23:27.433 --> 23:29.633
WHAT IS IT?
OUT WITH IT.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.600
THERE'S THIS OTHER GIRL.
IZZIE!

23:31.633 --> 23:33.267
OTHER GIRL?
YOU HAVE ANOTHER GIRL?

23:33.300 --> 23:35.467
HE HASN'T TOLD HER YET
THAT HE LIKES HER.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.833
IZZIE, WE ARE NOT
IN HIGH SCHOOL.
GEORGE HAS A LITTLE CRUSH.

23:36.867 --> 23:39.067
I DO NOT HAVE A CRUSH.
IT IS A THING.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.267
A THING
THAT IS VERY PERSONAL.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.733
ONE DAY, I'D LIKE TO BUILD
ON THIS THING

23:42.767 --> 23:45.233
WITH THIS OTHER GIRL--WOMAN.
SHE'S ALL WOMAN.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M JUST PLAYING WITH--

23:49.533 --> 23:52.600
NO, GEORGE, WITH OLIVIA?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH OLIVIA?
OH, NOTHING.

23:52.633 --> 23:54.267
YOU'RE LETTING HER THINK
YOU'RE EMOTIONALLY AVAILABLE.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.233
YOU'RE LETTING HER THINK
SHE HAS A CHANCE.

23:56.267 --> 23:59.167
AND THERE IS NOTHING WORSE
IN THE WORLD

23:59.200 --> 24:02.167
THAN THINKING YOU HAVE A CHANCE,
WHEN YOU REALLY DON'T.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.800
MEREDITH IS RIGHT. TELL HER
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.

24:04.833 --> 24:07.100
TELL HER WHY, GEORGE. I MEAN,
AT LEAST GIVE HER THE CHANCE

24:07.133 --> 24:10.600
TO HAVE SOME FEELINGS
ABOUT IT FOR GOD'S SAKE!
WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?

24:10.633 --> 24:12.633
BECAUSE I'VE GOT ESTROGEN,
GEORGE.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.600
BECAUSE OF ALL THE ESTROGEN.

24:15.633 --> 24:19.767
***

24:19.800 --> 24:22.367
SO, NEW SUBJECT?

24:25.433 --> 24:28.367
IT'S A MESS.
NO, IT ISN'T.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.133
I THINK I KNOW A MESS
WHEN I SEE A MESS.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.067
YOU'VE GOT THE HARVEST
TYING UP O.R. 1.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.833
SIEBERT TYING UP O.R. 2.
BOWEL OBSTRUCTION, O.R. 3--

24:33.867 --> 24:35.633
IT'S SIMPLY A BIT CROWDED.

24:35.667 --> 24:37.567
WELL, YOUR "CROWDED"
IS MY "SERIOUSLY OVERBOOKED."

24:37.600 --> 24:39.567
AND IN MY BOOK, "SERIOUSLY
OVERBOOKED" IS A MESS.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.767
(pager beeps)

24:40.800 --> 24:43.300
THEY NEED TO KNOW IF THERE'S
ANY WORD ON THE SEIBERT LIVER.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.567
HOW MUCH WORK
DO THEY HAVE LEFT?
A COUPLE OF HOURS.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.400
(cell phone rings)

24:45.433 --> 24:48.200
WELL, TELL HIM I'LL BE IN
TO SEE THEM.

24:48.233 --> 24:50.100
YOU BUMPED ME
FOR A BOWEL OBSTRUCTION?

24:50.133 --> 24:53.333
OH, UNEASY LIES THE HEAD
THAT WEARS THE CHIEF'S CAP.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.600
WAS IT
AN ACT OF DESPERATION?

24:58.633 --> 25:00.067
NOT AT ALL.

25:00.067 --> 25:01.733
SOMETHING TO ATTRACT
ATTENTION?

25:01.767 --> 25:03.633
OF COURSE NOT.

25:03.667 --> 25:07.267
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND HERE, MR. HUBBLE.

25:07.300 --> 25:08.467
WHY TEN DOLL HEADS?

25:08.500 --> 25:12.533
WELL, 'CAUSE ELEVEN
WOULD'VE BEEN TOO MUCH.

25:15.367 --> 25:17.267
I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH HIS MOTHER.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.200
MAYBE SHE ALWAYS WANTED A GIRL
AND GAVE HIM JUDY DOLLS

25:19.233 --> 25:21.133
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.

25:21.167 --> 25:24.100
AHA, I GOT ANOTHER ONE.

25:24.133 --> 25:25.733
I HAVE ONE HERE.

25:25.767 --> 25:28.333
DOYEN CLAMPS TO YANG.

25:28.367 --> 25:31.333
GREY, PUSH THE HEAD UP
TO THE INCISION.

25:31.367 --> 25:33.167
MAYBE HIS MOTHER LOOKED LIKE
JUDY AND HE WAS INTO VOODOO.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.100
INSTEAD OF STICKING PINS IN...

25:35.133 --> 25:37.367
AH, BLACK JUDY.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.300
BEFORE THEY GAVE HER
LONG HAIR.

25:40.333 --> 25:42.267
BACK WHEN SHE HAD
THE AFRO.

25:42.300 --> 25:45.300
SHE CAME WITH GO-GO BOOTS
AND A LEATHER JACKET.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.567
THAT'S A SHAME.
IT'S A REAL COLLECTOR'S ITEM.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.767
COLLECTIBLE DOLLS--
A NEW TWIST.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.567
SERIOUSLY, YOU CAN IDENTIFY
THESE DOLLS BY THEIR HEADS?

25:51.600 --> 25:53.367
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT, YANG?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.600
I LIKE JUDY DOLLS.
I OWN JUDY DOLLS.

25:55.633 --> 25:57.400
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE
WITH JUDY DOLLS

25:57.433 --> 25:58.633
IS THAT THEY'RE IN
THE BOWEL OF THIS MAN.

25:58.667 --> 26:01.567
BAILEY, I NEED AN INTERN
IN THE E.R.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.233
TO MEET
THE HARVEST DONOR.
O'MALLEY.

26:03.267 --> 26:05.367
SEE YA, TURBO.
YOU GOOD HERE?

26:05.400 --> 26:07.067
A COUPLE OF MORE HEADS
TO GO.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.700
THEN KAREV, STEVENS, YANG,
SCRUB OUT.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.067
YOU NEED TO GET AN ANSWER
FROM SEIBERT'S SON.

26:14.667 --> 26:15.633
OKAY.

26:15.667 --> 26:22.500
AH, YES, MOD JUDY.
SHE CAME WITH A YELLOW VESPA.

26:22.533 --> 26:24.433
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRANGE?

26:24.467 --> 26:26.367
WE HAVEN'T HAD
ENOUGH STRANGE?

26:26.400 --> 26:29.400
SHE LOOKS
A LITTLE LIKE YOU.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.700
THIS IS THE DONOR
FROM WILKESON GENERAL.

26:32.733 --> 26:35.067
JUST PUT HER IN HERE UNTIL
THE HARVEST TEAM COMES DOWN.

26:35.067 --> 26:36.067
THANKS.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.167
WELL, AT LEAST THIS ONE'S
HEART IS STILL BEATING.

26:48.067 --> 26:50.100
I THINK BAILEY WOULD
WANT ME TO...

26:50.133 --> 26:53.133
WE FINALLY REACHED THE FAMILY
OF THE DEAD MOTORIST.

26:53.167 --> 26:55.100
THEY LIVE IN PORTLAND.
SHOULD BE HERE IN A FEW HOURS.

26:55.133 --> 26:57.767
WANT ME TO PAGE YOU
WHEN THEY GET HERE?
YEAH, DO THEY KNOW?

26:57.800 --> 27:00.833
ONLY THAT WE WERE STILL
WORKING ON HIM.

27:00.867 --> 27:04.700
I THINK IT'S BETTER
TO HEAR BAD NEWS FIRST HAND.

27:04.733 --> 27:08.567
I KNOW I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO THE DOCTOR WHO CALLED IT.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.300
GET SOME ANSWERS.

27:11.333 --> 27:15.167
SO THAT I COULD GET ON
WITH MY LIFE.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.467
UH...

27:18.133 --> 27:20.267
GEORGE...

27:23.167 --> 27:25.533
DID YOU--

27:25.567 --> 27:27.767
DID YOU SEE THAT?

27:27.800 --> 27:29.700
SHE'S DECEREBRATE.
HER BRAIN'S--

27:29.733 --> 27:31.633
HER BRAIN STEM'S
STILL ALIVE. UM...

27:31.667 --> 27:33.333
OKAY, WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE. THANKS.

27:33.367 --> 27:35.433
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?

27:35.467 --> 27:38.367
SHE'S DECEREBRATE.
OKAY.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.367
YEAH, SHE CAN'T REALLY BE
DECLARED BRAIN DEAD.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.067
IT'S A SMALL REACTION.
THEY PROBABLY JUST MISSED IT.

27:43.067 --> 27:44.800
THE CORTEX IS DEAD.
THE BRAIN STEM WILL FOLLOW.

27:44.833 --> 27:46.733
DEATH IS IMMINENT.
WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT.

27:46.767 --> 27:48.467
YEAH, BUT DON'T YOU--

27:48.500 --> 27:50.700
SHE'LL BE DEAD BY THE TIME
WE GET TO THE O.R., DOCTOR.

27:50.733 --> 27:52.700
BUT SHE'S--

27:52.733 --> 27:55.700
SHE'S ALIVE NOW.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.167
(knocks on door)

28:07.200 --> 28:09.600
IT SMELLS LIKE
A HOSPITAL IN HERE.

28:09.633 --> 28:11.533
WHAT ARE WE DOIN'
WITH THIS GUY, PRESTON?

28:11.567 --> 28:13.600
IS THIS JUST AN EXERCISE?
I DON'T NEED THE PRACTICE.

28:13.633 --> 28:15.233
THE TRANSPLANT COMMITTEE
GAVE US THE GREEN LIGHT.

28:15.267 --> 28:18.267
I'M TRYIN' TO GET
AN ANSWER FROM THE SON.
WELL, THIS GUY'S
GOIN' THROUGH BLOOD

28:18.300 --> 28:20.533
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW,
AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY.

28:20.567 --> 28:23.067
HOW MUCH WORK
DO YOU HAVE LEFT NOW?
MAYBE AN HOUR AND A HALF.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.400
BUT WITHOUT A LIVER,

28:24.433 --> 28:27.567
I DON'T THINK THIS GUY'S
GONNA LAST THAT LONG.

28:30.733 --> 28:32.767
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO SCOTTY.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.700
I CAN TALK TO HIM.
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

28:34.733 --> 28:38.300
I THINK THEY WANT HIM TO MAKE
THE DECISION ON HIS OWN.

28:38.333 --> 28:41.300
YOU THINK I'M SICK
FOR WANTING TO SAVE MY HUSBAND,

28:41.333 --> 28:43.600
DON'T YOU?

28:43.633 --> 28:45.300
I THINK...

28:45.333 --> 28:48.100
YOUR FEELING VERY EMOTIONAL,

28:48.133 --> 28:50.067
AND WHEN
WE'RE FEELING EMOTIONAL,

28:50.067 --> 28:53.333
SOMETIMES IT'S--
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD

28:53.367 --> 28:57.067
TO KEEP A LEVEL HEAD
AND CONSIDER ALL THE FACTS.

28:57.067 --> 29:01.067
YOUR HUSBAND KILLED A MAN
ON THE HIGHWAY TODAY.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.467
HE ALMOST KILLED YOU
AND YOUR SON.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.400
THOSE ARE THE FACTS.

29:05.433 --> 29:08.600
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
IN LOVE, DOCTOR?

29:11.100 --> 29:13.300
HAVE YOU?

29:13.333 --> 29:17.300
LOVE HAS ITS LIMITS.

29:17.333 --> 29:21.067
***

29:22.533 --> 29:23.533
DR. SHEPHERD.

29:23.567 --> 29:24.767
DR. O'MALLEY.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.700
I WAS JUST IN I.C.U.
WITH THE HARVEST DONOR.

29:26.733 --> 29:28.333
AND DR. BAILEY, SHE HAS US

29:28.367 --> 29:30.267
DO EXAMS AND PROCEDURES
ON PATIENTS,

29:30.300 --> 29:31.633
EVEN IF THEY'RE DEAD.

29:31.667 --> 29:34.100
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

29:34.133 --> 29:35.067
UH, SHE'S DECEREBRATE.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.467
THE DONOR--HER BRAIN STEM
IS STILL ALIVE.

29:37.500 --> 29:41.233
***

29:41.267 --> 29:42.633
EXCUSE ME.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.567
I'M DEREK SHEPHERD,
HEAD OF NEUROSURGERY.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.533
YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK?

29:46.567 --> 29:50.267
OKAY, YEAH, UH,
SHE'S STILL POSTURING.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.333
WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION
OF WAITING UNTIL SHE'S DEAD.

29:52.367 --> 29:53.533
SHE'S IN AN IRREVERSIBLE COMA.

29:53.567 --> 29:55.467
HINES, THE NEURO AT WILKESON
RAN THE PROTOCOL.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.500
THEY MISSED DECEREBRATION.
WHAT ELSE DID THEY MISS?

29:57.533 --> 29:59.533
SHE HAS A TUMOR ON HER, UH...

29:59.567 --> 30:01.067
BRAIN STEM, RIGHT?

30:01.100 --> 30:02.433
I DON'T SEE AN M.R.I.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.733
DID YOU DO AN E.E.G.
TO CONFIRM BRAIN DEATH?

30:04.767 --> 30:06.633
YEAH, ACCORDING TO HINES.
I DON'T KNOW DR. HINES.

30:06.667 --> 30:07.633
WE HAVE SIX PATIENTS

30:07.667 --> 30:09.233
IN THREE STATES WAITING
FOR THIS WOMAN'S ORGANS.

30:09.267 --> 30:11.500
YEAH, AND I'M SURE THEY'D
ALL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT

30:11.533 --> 30:13.133
THE ORGANS THEY'RE
RECEIVING ARE FROM

30:13.167 --> 30:15.733
SOMEBODY WHO'S ACTUALLY
BRAIN DEAD.
NO ONE'S GONNA TOUCH HER
WHILE SHE'S ALIVE.

30:15.767 --> 30:18.367
FOR YOU TO IMPLY OTHERWISE--
IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE,
DR. ORSEN, DR. SHEPHERD?

30:18.400 --> 30:21.133
YEAH, WE HAVE A DONOR
WHO'S STILL DECEREBRATE.
AND?

30:21.167 --> 30:23.800
AND I WANNA DO AN E.E.G.
AND AN M.R.I.
(Orsen)
AN EXPENSIVE WASTE OF TIME.

30:23.833 --> 30:25.833
I INSIST ON IT.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.833
YOU INSIST ON IT?

30:27.867 --> 30:29.800
I DO.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.067
WELL, IF MY HEAD
OF NEUROSURGERY

30:36.100 --> 30:38.033
SAYS HE NEEDS AN E.E.G.
AND AN M.R.I.,

30:38.067 --> 30:39.600
HE NEEDS
AN E.E.G AND AN M.R.I.

30:39.633 --> 30:42.633
YOU REALIZE WE HAVE
SIX PATIENTS WAITING?

30:42.667 --> 30:44.200
THAT IS NOT MY CALL,
DR. ORSEN.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.033
WHO GETS THE ORGANS
IS UP TO U.N.O.S.

30:46.067 --> 30:48.033
WHO DONATES THE ORGANS
IS UP TO THE FAMILIES.

30:48.067 --> 30:50.800
HELL, I GOT A GUY IN THE O.R.
THAT'S WAITING FOR A LIVER

30:50.833 --> 30:52.733
THAT MAY NOT
EVEN DESERVE TO BE SAVED,

30:52.767 --> 30:54.667
AND AGAIN,
THAT'S NOT MY CALL.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.600
BUT YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT MY CALL IS?

30:56.633 --> 30:58.733
EVERYTHING ELSE.

30:59.767 --> 31:01.733
THE PATIENT IS YOURS,
DR. SHEPHERD.

31:01.767 --> 31:04.333
THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.

31:04.367 --> 31:07.500
DR. O'MALLEY, YOU WANT TO
ASSIST WITH THIS M.R.I.?

31:10.300 --> 31:12.067
LET'S GO.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.300
FIRST THING WE'LL DO
IS AN E.E.G.

31:13.333 --> 31:15.333
GEORGE, YOU WITH ME?

31:15.367 --> 31:17.700
(pager beeps)

31:17.733 --> 31:19.767
(Scott) WHAT IF HE GOES BACK
TO HITTING HER?

31:19.800 --> 31:21.700
YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT CALL,
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,

31:21.733 --> 31:23.633
YOU CAN'T MAKE THE DECISION
OUT OF ANGER.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.567
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH IT?

31:25.600 --> 31:28.367
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH YOURS?
ALEX!

31:28.400 --> 31:30.267
HEY, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
OUT HERE. DR. BURKE NEEDS--

31:30.300 --> 31:32.767
CAN YOU JUST BACK OFF,
PLEASE?

31:37.267 --> 31:39.633
MY ANGER HAD A LIFE
OF ITS OWN.

31:39.667 --> 31:41.567
I BULKED UP,
BECAME A WRESTLER,

31:41.600 --> 31:44.467
AND THE NEXT TIME
HE LAID A HAND ON MY MOTHER,

31:44.500 --> 31:46.400
I BEAT THE LIVING CRAP
OUT OF HIM.

31:46.433 --> 31:48.333
WHEN HE GOT OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL,

31:48.367 --> 31:49.700
HE TOOK OFF.

31:49.733 --> 31:53.600
HE JUST TOOK OFF
AND NEVER CAME BACK.

31:55.467 --> 31:57.433
I MEAN, HE WAS A COLD,
MEAN-TEMPERED BASTARD,

31:57.467 --> 32:00.133
BUT HE WAS STILL
MY OLD MAN, YOU KNOW?

32:00.167 --> 32:01.500
AND THEN NOW...

32:01.533 --> 32:03.433
NOW I CAN'T STOP WISHIN'

32:03.467 --> 32:07.733
THAT I'D NEVER LAID
A HAND ON HIM...

32:07.767 --> 32:11.533
THAT WE SOMEHOW
COULD'VE WORKED IT THROUGH.

32:20.567 --> 32:22.100
WHAT IS IT?

32:22.133 --> 32:24.400
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT YOU. I--

32:24.433 --> 32:27.067
WHAT?
WHAT DOES BURKE WANT?

32:27.067 --> 32:31.433
I'M SORRY, SCOTT.
HE NEEDS A DECISION NOW.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.833
WHEN WOULD IT HAPPEN?

32:57.867 --> 33:01.333
WE WOULD TAKE SCOTTY
TO PRE-OP IMMEDIATELY.

33:01.367 --> 33:03.267
THE TRANSPLANT SURGEON
IS ON CALL AND WAITING.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.267
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.233
SCOTTY...

33:09.867 --> 33:12.100
SCOTTY...

33:36.167 --> 33:38.067
YEAH, OKAY.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.133
I WANNA DO IT.

33:39.167 --> 33:40.733
(Burke) LET'S GET HIM
TO PRE-OP.

33:40.767 --> 33:44.133
I'LL CALL THE SURGEON.
BUT I HAVE A COUPLE
OF CONDITIONS.

33:46.867 --> 33:48.767
YOU'RE GONNA TELL THE COPS
THE TRUTH ABOUT

33:48.800 --> 33:52.300
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THIS ACCIDENT, MOM.

33:52.333 --> 33:55.367
AND... AS SOON
AS WE GET BACK HOME,

33:55.400 --> 33:57.500
YOU AND I ARE MOVING OUT.

33:57.533 --> 34:00.667
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

34:14.533 --> 34:16.433
(Burke) ...DONOR,
NO TRANSMITTABLE DISEASES.

34:16.467 --> 34:19.433
E.T.A. ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

34:19.467 --> 34:21.367
YOU KNOW SHE'S JUST
GONNA GO BACK TO HIM.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.600
NO, I DON'T KNOW THAT.
AND THAT'S NOT MY--

34:23.633 --> 34:25.400
THIS IS NOT OUR CALL.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.100
LOOK, CRISTINA...

34:32.867 --> 34:35.267
I WAS WONDERING, UH,
I MEAN, UH...

34:35.300 --> 34:39.733
I WAS HOPING THAT
WE CAN, UH...

34:39.767 --> 34:41.433
I KNOW WE DIDN'T--

34:41.467 --> 34:43.600
YOU'RE ASKING ME...

34:43.633 --> 34:46.433
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:48.067 --> 34:50.067
CAN I SCRUB IN?

34:56.367 --> 35:00.267
THEN, YES, DR. BURKE,
I'M OKAY.

35:06.500 --> 35:10.367
KAREV, LET'S GET HIM
TO PRE-OP.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.233
YOU SEE THE TUMOR
ON HER BRAIN STEM RIGHT HERE?

35:13.267 --> 35:14.800
IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD.

35:14.833 --> 35:16.733
YOU EVER HAD
A CRAPPY DAY, O'MALLEY?

35:16.767 --> 35:18.067
I MEAN, REALLY,
REALLY CRAPPY.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.833
I HAVE HAD MANY
CRAPPY DAYS.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.833
THIS ONE JUST GOT BETTER.

35:21.867 --> 35:23.767
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GO HOME, GENTLEMEN.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.700
I WILL BE THE ONLY ONE OF US
PERFORMING SURGERY HERE TODAY.

35:26.733 --> 35:29.100
MY FRIEND HERE
HAS A VIABLE BRAIN.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.733
OKAY.

35:31.767 --> 35:33.733
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'LL BE OKAY?

35:33.767 --> 35:35.667
IF I GET THE TUMOR OUT,

35:35.700 --> 35:38.500
SHE'S GOT A GOOD SHOT
AT RECOVERY.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.067
LOOK OUT FOR HER.

35:49.767 --> 35:51.533
MEREDITH?

35:51.567 --> 35:54.667
YEAH.

35:57.400 --> 36:00.467
(pager beeps)

36:05.133 --> 36:07.767
OH.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.333
UM...

36:11.100 --> 36:13.800
IS THAT THE FAMILY
OF THE DEAD GUY?

36:13.833 --> 36:15.567
YEAH.

36:17.333 --> 36:20.400
LOOK, MAYBE I'M NOT OVER
THE ALEX THING

36:20.433 --> 36:24.067
OR THE SYPH THING YET.

36:24.067 --> 36:27.300
THAT--THAT'S NOT REALLY
THE PROBLEM.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.533
THERE'S A GIRL
WHO I, UH...

36:33.567 --> 36:36.833
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT THERE'S THIS OTHER GUY,

36:36.867 --> 36:41.100
AND FRANKLY, I WOULDN'T CARE
IF SHE GAVE ME THE EBOLA VIRUS.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.133
I LIKE YOU, OLIVIA.

36:47.167 --> 36:49.400
BUT...

36:49.433 --> 36:52.633
I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH.

36:55.233 --> 36:58.633
I GAVE IT A SHOT, RIGHT?

36:58.667 --> 37:01.467
AND YOU WERE HONEST.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.700
THAT'S GOOD.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.600
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA TELL THEM?

37:17.267 --> 37:20.667
WHY DO WE HUMP ON EVERY DEAD
OR DYING PATIENT

37:20.700 --> 37:22.233
THAT COMES THROUGH
THOSE DOORS?

37:22.267 --> 37:25.167
EXPERIENCE?

37:25.200 --> 37:29.133
SO WE CAN TELL THEIR FAMILY THAT
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD.

37:38.300 --> 37:39.833
ARE YOU TED'S FAMILY?

37:39.867 --> 37:41.733
(Woman) YEAH, YEAH,
WE'RE TED'S FAMILY.

37:41.767 --> 37:43.767
HI, HOW ARE YOU?
I'M DOCTOR...

37:49.733 --> 37:51.767
JUST WHEN THE DAY
WAS IMPROVING.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.467
YOU TOLD MEREDITH
WHAT HAPPENED.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.400
I DID.
WHAT'D YOU TELL HER?

37:55.433 --> 37:56.600
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
DO DESPERATE THINGS

37:56.633 --> 37:59.200
TO ATTRACT ATTENTION.
WHAT?

37:59.233 --> 38:01.133
WOW. SO THAT'S YOUR SIDE
OF THIS,

38:01.167 --> 38:03.067
THAT I DIDN'T PAY YOU
ENOUGH ATTENTION?

38:03.100 --> 38:04.300
WAS THAT
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING

38:04.333 --> 38:06.233
WHEN YOU GOT NAKED
WITH MY BEST FRIEND?

38:06.267 --> 38:08.733
NO, BY THAT POINT, I WASN'T
THINKING AT ALL, DEREK.

38:08.767 --> 38:10.667
BY THAT POINT, I WAS JUST
SCRATCHING AN ITCH.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.600
WE GOT SUCCESSFUL,
YOU AND ME.

38:12.633 --> 38:14.533
WE GOT BUSY
AND WE GOT LAZY.

38:14.567 --> 38:16.467
WE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
TO FIGHT ANYMORE, DEREK.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.400
AND MARK WAS THERE,
AND I MISSED YOU.

38:18.433 --> 38:19.467
AND NOW I'M SORRY.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.533
I'M MORE SORRY THAN YOU
COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE,

38:21.567 --> 38:25.133
BUT AT LEAST I'M TALKING
TO YOU ABOUT IT. DEREK--

38:25.167 --> 38:27.200
I'M A SINK
WITH AN OPEN DRAIN, ADDIE.

38:27.233 --> 38:29.167
***

38:29.200 --> 38:31.267
DID YOU GET THEM ALL?

38:31.300 --> 38:33.167
YES. IT WASN'T EASY

38:33.200 --> 38:34.700
OR VERY PLEASANT.

38:34.733 --> 38:36.733
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

38:36.767 --> 38:38.667
EMPTY.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.100
I FEEL EMPTY NOW.

38:40.133 --> 38:42.600
YEAH, I'VE BEEN FEELING

38:42.633 --> 38:45.400
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT
MYSELF LATELY.

38:45.433 --> 38:48.267
I COULD SEE THAT.

38:48.300 --> 38:51.767
***

38:51.800 --> 38:53.100
MR. HUBBLE,

38:53.133 --> 38:55.233
WHY DOES EATING DOLL HEADS
FILL YOU UP?

38:55.267 --> 38:57.733
WHAT'S THE SATISFACTION?

38:57.767 --> 39:00.733
DO YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?

39:00.767 --> 39:03.600
WOULD IT BE
TOO MUCH INFORMATION?

39:03.633 --> 39:06.600
IT MIGHT.

39:08.633 --> 39:11.167
MAYBE I'M BETTER LEFT
IN THE DARK.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.300
THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID

39:13.333 --> 39:17.433
ABOUT A GLASS HALF FULL...

39:17.467 --> 39:20.767
ABOUT KNOWING
WHEN TO SAY WHEN.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.300
***

39:31.367 --> 39:33.633
I THINK IT'S A FLOATING LINE,

39:36.367 --> 39:39.300
***

39:47.800 --> 39:51.067
IT'S ENTIRELY
UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL...

39:57.600 --> 40:00.400
AND DEPENDS
ON WHAT'S BEING POURED.

40:00.433 --> 40:03.600
***

40:11.800 --> 40:13.700
SOMETIMES...

40:13.733 --> 40:16.300
ALL WE WANT IS A TASTE.

40:16.333 --> 40:19.767
***

40:21.200 --> 40:22.333
OTHER TIMES,

40:22.367 --> 40:24.267
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS ENOUGH.

40:24.300 --> 40:27.300
THE GLASS IS BOTTOMLESS.

40:36.300 --> 40:39.200
AND ALL WE WANT

40:39.233 --> 40:41.233
IS MORE.
