12:27.680 --> 12:29.511
They, uh, checked
the register tapes.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.277
Somebody bought
the stuffed gorilla

12:31.350 --> 12:33.375
maybe three minutes
before they locked the doors.

12:33.452 --> 12:34.919
$400. Cash.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.245
$400?

12:36.322 --> 12:37.516
What was it stuffed with?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.024
Oh, wait, three minutes
to take the escalator

12:40.092 --> 12:43.550
down from the 5th Floor
with a little girl,
a big stuffed animal

12:43.629 --> 12:45.824
and get out the front door
before it's sealed?

12:45.898 --> 12:48.833
Who did the interviews
at the back door,
the loading entrance?

12:48.901 --> 12:51.836
Uh, it was the 26.
15, 20 guys, plus uniforms.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.895
Okay, so the order goes
out to seal the place.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.032
How much you wanna bet
the news traveled faster

12:56.108 --> 12:58.372
to the main floor
than the loading dock?

12:58.444 --> 12:59.809
Go for it.

13:00.846 --> 13:02.837
(Bova)
Aunt Polly gives them
a flowered tie,

13:02.915 --> 13:04.815
they exchange it
for a toaster oven.

13:04.884 --> 13:07.182
Too many Aunt Pollies,
my back goes out.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.880
Merry Christmas.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.487
We locked the gate.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.717
Before the street doors,
after, I don't know.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.760
Anybody ask you
if you saw the little girl?

13:14.827 --> 13:16.317
Only about 40 cops.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.124
I had 20, 30 customers here,

13:18.197 --> 13:19.926
kids, loading stuff into cars.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.557
I mean,
even if I was looking...

13:21.634 --> 13:23.864
Anybody load
a big stuffed gorilla?

13:23.936 --> 13:26.734
End of the day,
you could give me a box
of thousand-dollar bills,

13:26.806 --> 13:27.830
I wouldn't notice.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.807
Gorilla?
L... I helped her.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.272
She had a kid with her.

13:31.343 --> 13:32.867
You get a look at the lady?

13:32.945 --> 13:35.778
Dark hair. Kinda old,
40 or something like that.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.475
I didn't really get
a good look at her.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.812
What about her car?

13:38.884 --> 13:40.317
It was real nice,
uh, brand new,

13:40.386 --> 13:43.150
um, grey, with one of them
black leather tops.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.246
Landau.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.382
Is that what they call it?
It was a Lincoln.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.016
Huh, lucky
she didn't get towed, man.

13:48.093 --> 13:52.029
I tell her,
"Over here you get towed."
All she got was a ticket.

13:56.101 --> 13:59.036
(Logan)
Three square blocks,
11:00 a.m. To 1:00 p.m. Shift?

13:59.104 --> 14:01.436
I mean, how many tickets
can two meter-maids write?

14:01.507 --> 14:05.136
Looks like
they nailed over 200 cars,
most of them Japanese.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.907
Oh, there's another reason
to buy American.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.106
[Exclaims]

14:09.181 --> 14:11.843
61st and Lex. 1:45.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.449
Green Lincoln.
Street cleaning.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.648
Street cleaning?
They still do that
in New York?

14:19.391 --> 14:23.851
Red zone, 63rd and 3rd.
2:00. Grey Lincoln.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.305
How you doir?
You Alan Fischer?

14:36.909 --> 14:37.933
Yeah.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.671
You own a grey Lincoln?

14:39.745 --> 14:41.076
What happened?
Somebody steal it?

14:41.146 --> 14:43.740
Ah, look,
we wanna ask you
a few questions, okay?

14:43.816 --> 14:45.283
I drove it an hour ago,
it's okay.

14:45.351 --> 14:47.911
The questiors about
Samantha Silver.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.186
Look, you guys
have a warrant?

14:51.257 --> 14:52.622
'Cause if you don't,
I'm afraid...

14:52.691 --> 14:53.680
We don't need a warrant.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.351
(Briscoe)
Stay right there.
Don't move.

14:55.427 --> 14:56.860
Samantha,
come here, honey.
Mommy!

14:56.929 --> 14:57.918
Are you Samantha?

14:57.997 --> 14:59.931
Get your hands off her!
Who the hell are you?

14:59.999 --> 15:01.023
This your daughter?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.124
Don't touch my daughter.

15:02.201 --> 15:03.327
All right,
we made a mistake.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.426
Alan, what's going on?

15:04.503 --> 15:05.492
Mike.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.368
(Myra)
Jennifer, it's okay, honey.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.805
No one's gonna hurt you.
It's gonna be okay.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.035
It'll be all right.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.834
This is crazy.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.309
I bought that for my daughter.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.313
Ah, sure you did.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.078
That's why
you wouldn't open the door.

15:19.151 --> 15:22.086
Your car, Mr. Fischer.
It was ticketed
right outside the store.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.917
(Alan)
I couldn't find a spot.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.650
I had to pick up some...

15:25.724 --> 15:27.282
Some, uh,

15:27.893 --> 15:29.520
Airplane tickets?

15:30.262 --> 15:32.025
Clothes? Shoes?

15:32.531 --> 15:33.862
What'd you have to pick up?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.958
Where'd you park the car?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.001
62nd Street.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.561
63rd. Your wife drove the car.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.967
We have somebody
who can identify her.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.944
Is the little girl dead, Alan?
Is that it?

15:48.013 --> 15:51.574
Somethir go wrong
before you could write
the ransom note?

15:52.351 --> 15:54.182
Why did you take her?

15:54.987 --> 15:57.217
What did you wanna do to her?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.689
Was it your wife?

16:00.993 --> 16:03.223
We had nothing to do with it.

16:04.396 --> 16:05.988
You bought
the stuffed animal.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.124
The store had six of 'em.
Now they have five.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.792
We bought it
downtown somewhere.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.597
Somewhere in the village.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.661
Keep diggir, Mrs. Fischer.

16:13.739 --> 16:16.674
Spencer's is the only place
that sells them.

16:19.011 --> 16:20.535
You have a daughter.

16:20.612 --> 16:24.776
You wanna trade
Christmas presents with her
in a prison waiting room?

16:25.918 --> 16:27.909
We did nothing wrong.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.083
[Telephone ringing]

16:30.889 --> 16:32.789
I wanna see my husband.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.190
You can't keep us here
like this.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.160
Well, you can
always have a lawyer.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.129
We don't need a lawyer.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.300
You can't be as stupid
as you sound, Mr. Fischer.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.960
Kidnapping's
just like murder.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.333
25 years to life.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.065
We didn't kidnap her!

16:47.139 --> 16:48.367
Really?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.174
What did you do, huh?

16:50.242 --> 16:53.006
Invite her home
to play with your daughter?
Where is she?

16:53.078 --> 16:54.477
[Knock on door]

17:02.321 --> 17:04.185
Mr. Fischer's clean.

Myra Fischer,
one count trespassing
in 1991.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.953
She handcuffed herself
to the front door

17:18.337 --> 17:19.531
Thanks.

[Sighs]

17:23.709 --> 17:24.767
<i>[Phone ringing]</i>

17:24.843 --> 17:27.141
Of course our justice system
affords protection.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.703
Thousands of children abused
and nobody cares.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.682
And nobody gets convicted.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.014
So we rescue the children
ourselves.

17:34.086 --> 17:36.520
Does that include
Samantha Silver?

17:37.222 --> 17:39.122
Who's Samantha Silver?

17:39.958 --> 17:41.448
All right.
You can call it rescue.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.119
A grand jury
calls it kidnapping.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.457
Is that a threat, Detective?

17:44.530 --> 17:45.622
No, it's penal law.

17:45.697 --> 17:47.494
Now, where did the Fischers
take the girl?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.932
The Fischers
have nothing to do
with this organization.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.731
Oh, so you've heard
of the Fischers,

17:51.804 --> 17:53.704
but you've never heard
of Samantha Silver?

17:53.772 --> 17:55.296
(Logan)
Well, let me just inform you,

17:55.374 --> 17:57.399
the Fischers are in a cell
at Central Booking.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.602
Would you care to join them?

17:58.677 --> 18:00.907
This is the last stop
on the train.

18:00.979 --> 18:03.447
Unless we find Samantha,
you're it.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.743
Maybe you should talk to...

18:06.819 --> 18:08.218
Sally...
Ned.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.785
We gave her money,

18:09.855 --> 18:12.983
what she does with it
is not our responsibility.

18:15.127 --> 18:17.220
You have to talk
to Ramona Stark.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.787
She's a child psychologist.
Very well known.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.561
You better hope
she's still on
the train, too.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.226

Nice to meet you.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.593
You're under arrest
for the kidnapping
of Samantha Silver.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.191
It's okay, Samantha.
We're gonna take you home
to your daddy.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.327
No!

19:31.403 --> 19:34.031
I'm Janet Silver.
Samantha's my daughter.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.903
She wasrt kidnapped.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.698
She's here at my request.

19:37.776 --> 19:40.745
Mrs. Silver,
your daughter was abducted
from a department store

19:40.812 --> 19:42.905
and from your husband's
legal custody.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.312
She was taken
for her protection.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.317
My husband
will never see her again.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.216
I want charges
brought against him.

19:48.287 --> 19:52.018
Samantha has told us
that her father
repeatedly molested her.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.068
You're not gonna do anything?

20:04.136 --> 20:07.037
Does Samantha
have to spell it out for you
in her alphabet soup?

20:07.105 --> 20:10.438
She took showers with him
and his live-in girlfriend,

20:10.542 --> 20:12.703
naps with them
when she was naked.

20:12.778 --> 20:14.712
My child
was living in terror.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.078
Mrs. Silver, we are sorry
for your daughter,

20:17.149 --> 20:20.243
but an accusation
is not enough
for us to prosecute.

20:20.319 --> 20:21.445
(Dr. Jenner)
Oh, no.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.317
I examined the girl.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.356
No, there is no doubt
what happened.

20:25.424 --> 20:28.018
Dr. Jenner, you examined her
two weeks ago.

20:28.093 --> 20:31.221
It's too late for us
to corroborate your report.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.492
Is my integrity
in question here?

20:33.565 --> 20:35.863
You have a history
of testifying in these cases.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.458
That'd be brought out
in court.

20:37.536 --> 20:41.028
We'd like to have
Samantha examined
by our psychiatrist.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.505
Dr. Stark has a Ph.D.
In child psychology.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.377
She has dedicated
her life to this.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.303
Is she not
a good enough expert?

20:49.381 --> 20:51.713
Nothing changes, does it?
A child is in danger

20:51.783 --> 20:53.774
you're refusing
to protect her.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.183
I won't give her up.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.188
I'll go to jail
before she goes back to him.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.247
There is not enough evidence.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.450
It is as simple as that.

21:00.525 --> 21:04.120
Come on, Ben.
Is this about evidence,
or is it visibility?

Look, you tell Schiff

I tell him,
"Go get 'em, tiger,"
I pat him on the can,

away in leg irons.

the psychologist,

21:56.848 --> 21:58.338

any of it?

It doesn't matter
what I believe.

of this.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.451
An accusation alone
could destroy his life.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.787
We pursue it,
it doesn't stick,

22:06.858 --> 22:09.019
we end up
with high-profile egg
on our face.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.358
There's gonna be
high-profile egg
no matter what we do.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.330
We need corroboration.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.156
You get a court order
to examine the child.

22:16.234 --> 22:18.566
No corroboration,
no indictment.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.169
What does that do
to Samantha?

22:22.240 --> 22:24.174
My client is concerned.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.640
The effect of
a psychiatric exam.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.373
We can't ignore the charge.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.779
(Gary)
Did you see the papers
when we got divorced?

22:30.849 --> 22:32.817
"Wife calls producer
selfish and brutal."

22:32.884 --> 22:34.545
She smeared me
all over the papers.

22:34.619 --> 22:36.382
And now you're helping her
do it again.

22:36.455 --> 22:39.083
And just because I'm in love
with my daughter's nanny

22:39.157 --> 22:41.022
does not make me
a child molester.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.685
We're fighting
the court order.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.023
Insufficient grounds.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.654
Counselor,
we have a medical exam.

22:45.731 --> 22:47.961
Well, of course, you do.
I mean, whose doctor?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.524
I read about
this Ramona Stark.
She's a nut.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.297
I mean, my wife
wants to destroy me

22:52.371 --> 22:54.635
and you'll ruin my...
my daughter's life.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.266
For what?
Public spectacle, page 6!

[Door opening]

22:59.745 --> 23:00.734
[Door slamming]

23:00.812 --> 23:03.280
Ramona Stark
as your prime witness?

23:03.715 --> 23:06.047
I wouldn't go to trial
with that.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.076
[Door opening]

23:10.055 --> 23:12.023
Who's Silver worried about?

23:12.090 --> 23:13.921
His daughter? Or himself?

23:13.992 --> 23:15.289
He may be right about Stark.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.955
So let's find out
what other cases
she's been involved in.

23:20.332 --> 23:21.959
She's a saint.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.558
They should put
a statue of her
in front of Family Court.

23:24.636 --> 23:25.728
Hmm.

23:26.705 --> 23:29.173
She testified for you
against your husband.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.936
And gave us a place to hide,

23:31.009 --> 23:33.443
until they put
that swine in jail.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.546
Did your child testify?

23:37.382 --> 23:39.009
She was very frightened.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.552
But, uh, Ramona helped her.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.083
By getting her ready
to testify.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.989
My daughter didn't invent it.
It happened.

23:47.559 --> 23:51.188
If Ramona helped her
put it into words,
that's not a crime.

23:52.297 --> 23:54.288
The fact that
you're worried about Ramona,

23:54.366 --> 23:56.163
and not Gary Silver,

23:56.301 --> 23:59.361
proves
you're part of the problem,
not the solution.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.797
I never had much faith
in divorce laws

24:02.874 --> 24:04.967
and nothing's happened
to change my mind.

24:05.043 --> 24:06.670
You lost custody of your son.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.337
You want a shotgun offence?

24:08.413 --> 24:09.846
I'll give you my ex-wife,

24:09.915 --> 24:12.440
her fleabag lawyer
and Ramona Stark.

24:12.551 --> 24:15.111
Now, you were charged
with molesting your son,
Mr. Sanders.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.883
I was charged with it,
but it never went to trial,
did it?

24:17.956 --> 24:18.980
(Mr. Sanders)
I caved in.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.422
I gave my wife
what she wanted.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.585
Suddenly she decides
not to testify.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.856
You people don't have a case.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.191
I never touched my son.

24:27.265 --> 24:29.096
But people are accused
all the time.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.634
They defend themselves.

24:30.702 --> 24:31.828
[Exclaims]

24:31.903 --> 24:34.098
I sat in her lawyer's chair

24:34.206 --> 24:35.969
and I watched a tape.

24:36.041 --> 24:39.340
My little boy saying that
I put my hand on his "dupe."

24:39.411 --> 24:41.106
I knew I was dead.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.876
(Mr. Sanders)
I haven't seen him since.

24:43.949 --> 24:46.110
$1,100 child support.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.946
I don't even get visitation.

24:50.388 --> 24:51.514
And what does that prove?

24:51.590 --> 24:52.818
She's a busy lady.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.222
We got a Chinese menu here.

24:54.292 --> 24:57.261
Column A, she's the savior
of all molested children.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.230
Column B,
she scares innocent men
into giving up their kids.

25:00.298 --> 25:01.595
Silver's lawyer is right.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.760
With Stark's history,
we put her on the stand
they'll eat her for lunch.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.100
We don't put her on the stand,
they will.

Hmm-mmm.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.039
Thanks.

25:15.714 --> 25:16.806
We got the order.

25:16.882 --> 25:19.043
Olivet sees Samantha Silver
in the morning.

25:19.117 --> 25:20.243
Good.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.453
What are your favorite pets,
Samantha?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.857
Mommy tells me
you like puppies.

25:29.494 --> 25:31.792
Sometimes Brown Dog barks.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.461
You can't hear it.
But I can.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.394
What's Brown Dog barking at?

25:38.336 --> 25:39.598
Secrets.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.901
That's very good.

25:44.009 --> 25:45.408
I have an idea.

25:45.477 --> 25:48.469
Why don't we draw a picture
of your family?

26:06.031 --> 26:07.396
Who's that?

26:07.632 --> 26:08.656
Mommy.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.758
I need blue for her eyes.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.603
And what about you?

26:31.222 --> 26:32.655
That's fine.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.559
What's Daddy look like?

26:39.431 --> 26:41.695
[Whispers]
It's okay. Go ahead.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.183
Remember
what I told you about

26:59.250 --> 27:02.117
"good touches"
and "bad touches", Samantha?

27:02.854 --> 27:04.845
How did Daddy touch you?

27:10.195 --> 27:12.186
Whers Mommy coming back?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.761
She'll be here soon.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.999
Where did Daddy touch you?
Show me.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.799
Just draw a circle
where he touched you.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.769
I don't wanna talk anymore.

27:37.622 --> 27:39.817
Her behavior's
consistent with abuse.

27:39.891 --> 27:43.349
Avoidance, reluctance
to discuss details, guilt.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.862
I'm sure
that's what Ramona Stark
reacted to.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.899
But she did not say
that her father molested her.

27:48.967 --> 27:50.559
Which doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

27:50.635 --> 27:52.364
What about
the medical report?

27:52.437 --> 27:53.836
Do you agree with Jenner?

27:53.905 --> 27:56.169
If I'd seen her at the time,
I might be sure.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.230
Jenner says

27:57.308 --> 27:59.742
there's scarring
near her labia
and she's not intact,

27:59.811 --> 28:01.244
but there are no
bacterial traces

28:01.312 --> 28:03.280
which you'd expect
with a recent abuse.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.784
Why does every word you say
sound like maybe
and then maybe not?

28:06.851 --> 28:09.547
I think it happened.
But is it conclusive?

28:09.621 --> 28:11.213
Not to mention
that she's confused.

28:11.289 --> 28:13.223
Too much prompting
from Stark and her mother.

28:13.291 --> 28:14.918
(Olivet)
She's not a terrific witness.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.187
This gets better
every minute.

28:16.261 --> 28:19.526
What about the father?
Does he fit the portrait
of a molester?

28:19.597 --> 28:22.430
Mid-50s, no prior record,
you wouldn't think so.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.331
Unless he's a "preferential."

28:24.402 --> 28:25.630

What's that?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.137

28:27.205 --> 28:29.230
Wasrt he married before?

28:29.407 --> 28:30.704
Twenty years ago.

28:30.775 --> 28:32.902
Did they have any children?

28:36.581 --> 28:39.175
The night I was born,
<i>Hair</i> opened on Broadway.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.514
Guess whose premiere
Daddy attended?

28:41.586 --> 28:43.850
Doesrt sound like
you've patched things up.

28:43.922 --> 28:45.082
Oh, as far as
he's concerned,

28:45.156 --> 28:47.249
I'm a show that closed
on opening night.

28:47.325 --> 28:49.657
Anyhow, I moved out
when I was 7.

sends me to Grandma's
in Greenwich

28:55.100 --> 28:56.328
for the length of the run.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.266
Grandma never sends me back.

28:58.336 --> 29:00.827
(Leslie)
She hated him.
She still does.

29:00.905 --> 29:04.534
Maybe because
Mom moved you to Grandma's
for other reasons.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.838
(Robinette)
They say in families,

29:06.911 --> 29:09.436
it usually doesn't happen
only once.

29:10.715 --> 29:14.344
I suppose
you've spoken with your Dad
in the last few days.

29:15.854 --> 29:19.085
Okay. There are some memories
that seem strange.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.321
I remember
being alone in bed,

29:22.627 --> 29:25.460
and I'd hear their door open
down the hall

29:25.663 --> 29:28.154
and Daddy walking
towards my room.

29:30.201 --> 29:31.793
I'd wet the bed.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.401
I thought
that would protect me.

29:34.472 --> 29:36.372
Protect you from what?

29:37.008 --> 29:39.943
Look, I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

29:43.581 --> 29:45.572
You absolutely convinced?

29:46.050 --> 29:48.041
Doesrt leave me
with any doubts.

29:48.119 --> 29:51.577
It's not showers and sleeping
in the same bed anymore,
Adam.

29:51.656 --> 29:53.180
If he molested
the first one,

29:53.258 --> 29:56.227
the chances of his
not doing it again
are almost nil.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.660
(Robinette)
I checked the older daughter's
new apartment.

29:58.730 --> 30:01.130
Silver paid for it,
closed 10 days ago.

30:01.199 --> 30:02.860
He bought her off.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.128
Useless without
her testimony.

30:05.203 --> 30:06.761
What about his girlfriend?

30:06.838 --> 30:08.066
She's the child's nanny.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.130
His lawyer
won't let us near her.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.733
Your medical doctor
is questionable,

30:13.144 --> 30:15.237
this Ramona Stark is tainted.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.713
She makes Joan of Arc
look modest.

30:18.516 --> 30:21.246
The child is
a terrible witness.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.515
So you wanna plead him?

30:23.588 --> 30:25.886
He molested
his own child, Adam.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.217
Plead him. Sex abuse two.

30:29.894 --> 30:32.158
He won't do better
from a jury.

30:32.730 --> 30:33.924
Sexual abuse two.

30:33.998 --> 30:37.024
Considering what he did,
it's a gift from God.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.296
I didn't do anything
to Samantha.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.634
What about your
first daughter?

30:43.741 --> 30:45.231
Leslie's mother was,

30:45.310 --> 30:46.902
for years,
clinically depressed.

30:46.978 --> 30:49.037
(Gary)
Of course,
Leslie has problems.

30:49.113 --> 30:50.171
My understanding is

30:50.248 --> 30:52.944
that Leslie has
absolutely nothing negative
to say about me.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.746
Odd time
to buy her an apartment.

Samantha was probably abused.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.052
Ten minutes
with Ramona Stark,

she'll accuse her father
of being a serial killer.

My client
comes out of this clean

31:06.631 --> 31:08.394

Mr. Silver,
that process was well underway
before now.

You have all that.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.495
You have Miss Stark's report.

31:42.567 --> 31:46.264
I believe he did it,
but we don't have enough
to convince a grand jury.

Do you think
Gary's gonna stand up
and say he did it?

7 million people
in New York are convinced.

and mention his name.

even her mother's lawyer
knows it's trouble.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.778
Homemade evidence.
I don't like it.

33:06.851 --> 33:08.842
The courts like it less.
Who's your judge?

33:08.920 --> 33:10.217
Wally Schreiber.

33:10.288 --> 33:11.846
You expect to get this in?

33:11.923 --> 33:14.585
Schreiber thinks
the admissibility rules

33:14.659 --> 33:16.923
were made in Heaven,
not Albany.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.792
A mars own daughter.

33:19.597 --> 33:21.724
I hope there's an afterlife.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.969
For some crimes,
the penal law is inadequate.

33:28.139 --> 33:29.834
Mrs. Silver
had the tape made.

33:29.907 --> 33:32.705
She's a lunatic.
And so is Ramona Stark.

33:33.077 --> 33:35.875
Their state of mind
does not make the tape
inadmissible.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.107
Doesrt it, Ben?

33:37.181 --> 33:39.342
We don't know what was said
before the tape was made.

33:39.417 --> 33:42.750
There's no reason to believe
that it wasrt spontaneous,
Your Honor.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.846
About as spontaneous
as the Pledge of Allegiance.

33:45.923 --> 33:49.552
Your Honor, Dr. Olivet said
the child was subjected
to trauma.

33:49.627 --> 33:51.993
Without that tape,
we have to put her
on the stand.

33:52.063 --> 33:53.052
We don't wanna do that.

33:53.131 --> 33:54.860
(Teller)
How warm-hearted of you.

33:54.932 --> 33:56.422
The kid was coached, Judge.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.128
It's all made up,
every bit of it.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.363
Now, easy, Nick,
I read Olivet's report.

34:00.438 --> 34:02.736
It's not all made up.
Gentlemen.

34:04.142 --> 34:07.475
Ben, do you remember
a case in Rhode Island?

34:08.246 --> 34:10.840
Insulin, needles,
the lady in the coma?

34:10.915 --> 34:13.281
They go into the mars house,
take the black bag...

34:13.351 --> 34:14.612
Which was admitted
as evidence.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.710
Yeah, in my view, a mistake.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.121
And the basis, I might add,
for a successful appeal.

34:20.792 --> 34:25.195
Now here, we have
an out-of-court statement
and the witness is available.

34:26.464 --> 34:27.795
I can't allow the tape, Ben.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.594
Your Honor,
the interests of the child...

34:29.667 --> 34:32.226
Balanced by
the interests of justice.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.928
If the man did it,
then put him away

34:35.572 --> 34:38.098
but we have to have
the girl testify.

34:38.775 --> 34:41.266
I'll be glad
to do it in chambers
with closed-circuit video,

34:41.344 --> 34:43.643
make it as painless
as possible.

34:43.714 --> 34:45.511
Think about it, hmm?

34:49.320 --> 34:52.221
Children have special ways
of telling us what happened.

34:52.290 --> 34:56.590
Please describe for the court
what you expect
in cases of sexual abuse.

34:57.728 --> 34:59.958
Children
who have been molested

35:00.031 --> 35:02.090
often cry when asked
about the incident.

35:02.166 --> 35:04.031
(Ramona)
They show anger,

35:04.102 --> 35:06.332
fear and sadness

35:06.404 --> 35:08.497
and in almost all cases,

35:08.573 --> 35:10.734
the child is unwilling
to discuss

35:10.808 --> 35:13.402
the specific details
of what happened.

35:13.478 --> 35:14.740
(Stone)
In your expert opinion,

35:14.812 --> 35:17.440
does Samantha Silver
fit this profile?

35:17.682 --> 35:19.775
Yes, in virtually
every respect.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.944
And Dr. Stark, is it possible

35:22.019 --> 35:24.852
that the alleged sexual abuse
of Samantha Silver

35:24.922 --> 35:26.719
is totally invented?

35:26.824 --> 35:28.689
Oh, no, I don't think
that's possible.

35:28.759 --> 35:32.957
L... I can't tell you
in explicit detail
what went on

35:33.831 --> 35:36.163
but something
certainly happened.

35:36.501 --> 35:37.729
Thank you.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.292
Your witness.

35:42.039 --> 35:43.768
Something happened.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.242
That's fairly vague,
isn't it?

35:46.310 --> 35:48.972
I'm a psychologist,
not a psychiatrist.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.640
But none of this
is an exact science.

35:52.183 --> 35:55.482
The girl went through
a serious trauma
concerning her father.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.544
That could mean anything.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.486
Can you state
with medical certainty

35:59.557 --> 36:01.525
that Gary Silver
molested his daughter?

36:01.592 --> 36:04.959
I can't say with certainty
the sun will rise tomorrow.

36:05.029 --> 36:07.327
But, yes,
short of absolute certainty,

36:07.398 --> 36:09.764
I think he molested
his daughter.

36:09.867 --> 36:10.856
(Teller)
You testified

36:10.935 --> 36:13.665
that Samantha Silver
had been subject to trauma

36:13.738 --> 36:15.535
involving her father.

36:15.907 --> 36:19.399
Could that include
her mother convincing her
Daddy molested her?

36:19.477 --> 36:20.637
If you're suggesting

36:20.711 --> 36:23.339
that her mother
planted the accusation
in her head,

36:23.414 --> 36:25.712
no, I don't believe
that's true.

36:26.918 --> 36:30.046
Suppose I find cereal spilled
on the kitchen floor.

36:30.121 --> 36:33.318
I ask my son,
"Did you do this?"
What does he say?

36:33.591 --> 36:35.422
I don't know your son,
Mr. Teller.

36:35.493 --> 36:36.892
He'll lie, Dr. Stark,

36:36.961 --> 36:39.225
because he's afraid
Daddy will be angry.

36:39.297 --> 36:42.824
But if I say I won't be angry,
he'll admit it, won't he?

36:43.367 --> 36:44.493
Possibly.

36:44.569 --> 36:45.968
(Teller)
He will.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.267
Because he wants to please me.

36:48.606 --> 36:51.803
Now, Samantha Silver
was taken from
a department store

36:51.876 --> 36:54.276
and held in
a strange environment.

36:55.012 --> 36:56.809
If she thought
the only way out

36:56.881 --> 36:58.644
was to accuse Daddy
of bad things

36:58.749 --> 37:00.876
isn't it possible she'd lie?

37:01.652 --> 37:04.519
It's possible, yes,
but she didn't need to lie.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.853
She just told us
what happened.

37:07.992 --> 37:10.324
I was naive
when I married Gary.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.259
I was his third wife.

37:12.830 --> 37:16.061
I thought
I would be the one
to make him settle down.

37:16.133 --> 37:17.361
I was wrong.

37:17.435 --> 37:19.767
Well, what made you feel
you were wrong?

37:19.837 --> 37:23.796
I thought
that Gary was obsessed
with Samantha,

37:24.809 --> 37:28.711
that he was using her
to make up for neglecting
his first child.

37:29.146 --> 37:30.511
(Christina)
Lt... it,

37:30.581 --> 37:32.344
It seemed unnatural.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.043
In what way, Mrs. Silver?

37:34.118 --> 37:36.586
Objection.
This is all speculation.

37:36.854 --> 37:39.550
She can talk about
her own feelings, Counselor.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.751
(Judge Schreiber)
Overruled.

37:42.126 --> 37:43.525
Mrs. Silver.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.224
He, uh,

37:47.064 --> 37:49.396
he wanted to take her
everywhere.

37:49.700 --> 37:53.261
He wouldn't let her
out of his sight,
he was hugging her,

37:53.571 --> 37:55.732
picking her up all the time.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.507
It was too possessive.

37:58.909 --> 38:02.970
But why did you ask
Ramona Stark to help you
hide Samantha?

38:03.648 --> 38:05.616
(Christina)
Samantha said

38:05.983 --> 38:09.749
that she was taking nude naps
with Gary and...

38:10.655 --> 38:12.247
(Christina)
Well,

38:12.323 --> 38:14.757
the nanny, his girlfriend.

38:16.694 --> 38:18.924
I, uh, I tried to ask

38:20.698 --> 38:22.893
if anything else
was going on

38:23.534 --> 38:25.399
but, uh, I scared her.

38:34.979 --> 38:38.142
I didn't... I didn't know
how to ask the question.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.842
It was... it was so ugly.

38:43.220 --> 38:44.278
My...

38:44.689 --> 38:48.216
My attorney said
that Ramona Stark
would know how to ask.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.594
(Stone)
Fine, thank you,
no further questions.

38:54.365 --> 38:55.593
So, uh,

38:57.134 --> 39:00.501
you couldn't talk
to your own daughter,
is that right?

39:01.672 --> 39:04.140
I didn't know if...
if my suspicions were right.

39:04.208 --> 39:06.335
L... I needed a professional.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.670
Oh, so you did think

39:07.745 --> 39:09.804
your husband
had done something wrong?

39:09.880 --> 39:10.869
[Coughs]

39:10.948 --> 39:12.472
Look, l... I didn't know.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.279
Or was it just
that you were jealous

39:14.352 --> 39:16.786
because he abandoned you
for a younger woman?

39:16.854 --> 39:18.617
I was worried, okay?

39:18.889 --> 39:20.823
I'm... I'm allowed
to be worried.

39:20.891 --> 39:22.085
Of course, you are.

39:22.159 --> 39:24.525
But you are not allowed
to brainwash
your own daughter.

39:24.595 --> 39:25.619
Objection.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.028
We... we didn't brainwash her,
for God's sake.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.691
We got a doctor.

39:36.607 --> 39:39.940
I'm a pediatrician
with a subspecialty
in internal medicine.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.910
Have you consulted
on other cases

39:41.979 --> 39:44.379
involving the sexual abuse
of children?

39:44.448 --> 39:47.815
I volunteer my services
for the Abused Childrers
Defense League.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.978
I'm on call at no charge.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.419
(Stone)
Now please tell the court

39:51.489 --> 39:55.220
the results
of your physical examination
of Samantha Silver.

39:55.926 --> 39:58.394
I found scarring
and bruising on the labia,

39:58.462 --> 40:00.259
and the hymen
had been ruptured.

40:00.331 --> 40:02.390
And what did you
conclude from that?

40:02.466 --> 40:05.299
(Dr. Jenner)
These were unusual conditions
for a child of her age.

40:05.369 --> 40:07.337
I concluded that
Samantha Silver

40:07.405 --> 40:10.533
had, in some way,
been sexually abused.

40:11.609 --> 40:12.940
Thank you.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.548
Dr. Jenner,

40:21.318 --> 40:25.049
could the conditions
you describe be caused
by anything else?

40:25.956 --> 40:27.184
I don't think so.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.250
Now, you say
you work on these cases
at no charge.

40:30.327 --> 40:32.488
In fact,
don't you make it a career?

40:33.631 --> 40:36.429
I have a thriving
pediatric practice, sir.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.267
How many of these cases
have you testified in?

40:39.336 --> 40:40.701
Twenty-two.

40:40.838 --> 40:42.271
(Teller)
Very impressive.

40:42.339 --> 40:44.773
Have you testified
for a defendant?

40:44.975 --> 40:46.909
In all the cases
that I've worked on,

40:46.977 --> 40:48.444
the defendants were guilty.

40:48.512 --> 40:49.706
Really?

40:51.949 --> 40:54.247
How many of them
were acquitted?

40:57.988 --> 40:59.012
Thirteen.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.250
Didrt you say
they were all guilty?

41:01.325 --> 41:02.451
They were.

41:02.526 --> 41:04.994
Not in the eyes
of the law, Doctor.

41:05.329 --> 41:07.160
No further questions.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.126
Don't have any choice.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.067
She's a confused,
frightened little girl.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.934
I don't know
how she'll do on the stand.

41:15.005 --> 41:17.030
If we can get her to say
what she said to Stark...

41:17.107 --> 41:18.574
She's talked to
too many people.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.371
(Stone)
She can't remember
what happened.

41:20.444 --> 41:23.379
Olivet prepped her six times.
Six different answers.

41:23.447 --> 41:26.109
We don't put her on,
the jury's gonna wonder
what we're hiding.

41:26.183 --> 41:28.845
The wife and...
What's her name, Stark?

41:29.987 --> 41:31.045
Yeah, the two of them

41:31.121 --> 41:34.420
tied your hands
behind your back
and then asked you to swim.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.757
And they sullied
every piece of testimony
we needed.

41:37.962 --> 41:40.988
Not to mention
the wife looked jealous
on the stand

41:41.065 --> 41:42.498
and that doctor...

41:42.566 --> 41:44.761
He defined the word "zealot."

41:46.770 --> 41:51.036
The child's gonna
have to talk to the jury
and tell them what happened.

41:54.812 --> 41:57.906
<i>(Samantha)</i>
<i>People always</i>
<i>wanna talk about Daddy.</i>

41:58.148 --> 41:59.137
<i>(Stone)</i>
<i>We'd like to know</i>

41:59.216 --> 42:01.081
<i>a few things</i>
<i>that your daddy did.</i>

42:01.719 --> 42:03.619
You mean the bad things?

42:03.687 --> 42:05.177
That's right.

42:08.225 --> 42:10.216
Why should I talk to you?

42:10.661 --> 42:11.787
We wanna make sure

42:11.862 --> 42:14.990
that your daddy doesn't do
the bad things again.

42:16.433 --> 42:19.266
Mommy says you're going
to put him in jail.

42:19.570 --> 42:22.368
Why do you think
your mommy would say that?

42:22.439 --> 42:25.806
Because I told her it was bad
where Daddy touched me.

42:26.410 --> 42:28.742
And how many times
did he touch you?

42:28.812 --> 42:31.042
<i>Ramona said he did it a lot.</i>

42:32.283 --> 42:33.910
<i>She's real mad, too.</i>

42:33.984 --> 42:35.918
<i>(Stone)</i>
<i>Now what Ramona</i>
<i>says doesn't matter.</i>

42:35.986 --> 42:38.420
<i>What matters</i>
<i>is what you remember.</i>

42:38.522 --> 42:39.819
<i>I told you.</i>

42:39.890 --> 42:43.519
<i>Daddy touched me,</i>
<i>and Ramona and Mommy said</i>
<i>he's bad.</i>

42:43.594 --> 42:45.084
<i>Aside from touching you,</i>

42:45.162 --> 42:48.563
<i>what are some</i>
<i>of the other things</i>
<i>that your daddy did?</i>

42:51.969 --> 42:53.903
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what I'm supposed to say.</i>

42:53.971 --> 42:55.268
<i>I forgot.</i>

42:55.706 --> 42:57.537
<i>Samantha, thank you.</i>

42:58.008 --> 43:00.238
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for talking with us.</i>

43:01.145 --> 43:04.376
<i>(Teller)</i>
<i>Samantha, do you have</i>
<i>puzzles like that at home?</i>

43:06.183 --> 43:08.378
I have bigger ones
in my room.

43:08.786 --> 43:10.686
At your daddy's house?

43:14.391 --> 43:17.019
<i>I have a big room</i>
<i>next to Christina's.</i>

43:17.261 --> 43:19.092
<i>(Teller)</i>
<i>Does Daddy do puzzles</i>
<i>with you?</i>

43:19.163 --> 43:21.358
<i>(Samantha)</i>
<i>Daddy doesn't like puzzles.</i>

43:21.432 --> 43:23.024
<i>We watch movies.</i>

43:24.368 --> 43:27.098
<i>You love your Daddy,</i>
<i>don't you, Samantha?</i>

43:30.708 --> 43:32.733
<i>You don't wanna see him</i>
<i>go to jail, do you?</i>

43:33.510 --> 43:34.499
Your Honor?

43:34.578 --> 43:37.445
Let's back away from that,
Mr. Teller. Hmm?

43:39.216 --> 43:42.879
Has your daddy
done anything to you

43:43.187 --> 43:45.417
that you think
he should be punished for?

43:45.489 --> 43:48.287
Mommy says
Daddy won't let me
go to France.

43:49.426 --> 43:51.360
He won't let you
go to France?

43:51.829 --> 43:53.990
<i>To live with Mommy</i>
<i>and her boyfriend,</i>

43:54.064 --> 43:55.827
<i>where I can have a pony.</i>

43:58.802 --> 44:00.497
<i>No more questions.</i>

44:03.874 --> 44:05.705
(Stone)
You wanted to leave
the country.

44:05.776 --> 44:08.472
To do that you needed
full custody, right?

44:08.545 --> 44:11.537
I wanted to protect her
from her father.
What's wrong with that?

44:11.615 --> 44:13.674
What is wrong is that
a jury can now be persuaded

44:13.751 --> 44:15.912
that you wanted full custody
for other reasons.

44:15.986 --> 44:17.817
You withheld
crucial information.

44:17.888 --> 44:19.617
That doesn't change
what happened.

44:19.690 --> 44:21.248
In a jury's mind it might.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.418
Are you saying
Mrs. Silver lied?

44:23.494 --> 44:27.430
No, what I'm saying is that
the clarity of the case
rests on Samantha,

44:27.498 --> 44:30.092
and your client and Mrs. Stark
had other agendas.

44:30.167 --> 44:32.931
They've so muddied the water
I don't know
what a jury'll believe.

44:33.003 --> 44:34.994
We wanted
to protect the child.

44:35.072 --> 44:36.596
You put so many ideas
in her head

44:36.674 --> 44:38.403
she can't tell us
anything clearly.

44:38.475 --> 44:41.501
When... when Samantha told me
about the showers,

44:41.645 --> 44:44.580
and that... that...
that girl naked in the house,

44:44.782 --> 44:46.807
what was I supposed to do?

44:46.884 --> 44:49.045
Samantha was mixed up today.

44:49.687 --> 44:52.121
The jury knows
what the father did.

44:55.025 --> 44:56.754
I hope you're right.

45:00.998 --> 45:03.193
(Judge Schreiber)
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

45:03.267 --> 45:05.098
(forewoman)
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

45:05.169 --> 45:06.693
On the sole count
of the indictment,

45:06.770 --> 45:09.204
the charge of sexual abuse
in the first degree,

45:09.273 --> 45:10.900
how does the jury find?

45:10.974 --> 45:14.569
We find the defendant
not guilty.

45:14.778 --> 45:15.836
No.

45:19.316 --> 45:20.544
[Sighs]

46:04.561 --> 46:06.119
[Knock on door]

46:09.867 --> 46:11.334
The girl is gone.

46:11.401 --> 46:13.835
And Janet Silver
refuses to say where she is.

46:13.904 --> 46:15.303
She'll have to
produce the child.

46:15.372 --> 46:16.839
The husband has
a court order.

46:16.907 --> 46:19.432
And now
I've got to make a victim
out of the mother.

46:19.510 --> 46:21.478
She's the one going to jail.

46:21.545 --> 46:23.638
I only see one victim here.

46:23.714 --> 46:25.841
And she's only 7 years old.
