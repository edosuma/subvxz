WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.670
Okay, we've exchanged make-up
gifts for lashing out
at each other,

00:04.672 --> 00:07.006
But the most important thing
is to also verbally apologize.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.540
Especially when we...

00:08.542 --> 00:11.677
Tried to blind somebody
with perfume.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.546
Sorry, nolan.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.048
It's okay.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.684
My eyeballs
never smelled better.

00:18.686 --> 00:22.454
Changed someone's ringtone
to "smack my bitch up."

00:24.190 --> 00:25.591
I'm sorry, ed.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.727
Tried to put someone
on the no-fly list.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.397
Sorry about that,
lacey.

00:32.599 --> 00:34.800
If that is your real name.

00:34.802 --> 00:38.237
Fyi, I'm already on
the no-fly list.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.572
Do not try to steal drinks
from flight attendants

00:40.574 --> 00:44.643
'cause those hos are located
here, here, and here.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.745
And referred to someone as...

00:46.747 --> 00:50.516
"a giant piece of crap
walking around in a bag
of human skin."

00:50.518 --> 00:53.419
Sorry, me.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.255
It's okay, me.

00:58.491 --> 01:00.092
Oh, hey, everybody.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.428
Sorry, charlie. I didn't
realize you were in group.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.129
- I don't wanna interrupt.
- It's okay, dad.

01:04.131 --> 01:09.601
- I was really in the mood
for grapefruit this morning.
- Yeah, sorry, dad.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.638
I was busy, but I'll make sure
I get everything on your list
when I go to the store later.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.606
- And don't forget the pudding.
- How could I?

01:14.608 --> 01:17.142
It was on your list twice
underlined with stars
and arrows.

01:17.144 --> 01:20.479
- I like pudding.
- Is that what that meant?

01:20.481 --> 01:23.182
- See you later, dad.
- And make sure you get
the eight-pack.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.552
- The four-pack's a joke.
- Oh, my god.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.688
- I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna interrupt.
- No problem, but you did.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.757
- Didn't mean to.
- But continue to.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.495
So is your father
living here now?

01:36.497 --> 01:41.433
No, it just seems that way
because he showed up last week
and now he won't go home.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.703
- Tells me he had
a problem with his plumbing.
- Maybe it's his building.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.505
Or maybe it's him

01:46.507 --> 01:49.341
With all that grapefruit
and pudding.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.710
All right, let's get back
to the session.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.145
I have a question.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.147
Nolan, you didn't do
anything to me.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.515
Why did you give me
a teddy bear?

01:56.517 --> 01:59.318
I just saw it
and thought it could
keep you company,

01:59.320 --> 02:01.653
You know, and if
you're happy you
can kiss it

02:01.655 --> 02:05.157
And if you're sad
you can just hold it
to your bosom.

02:05.159 --> 02:08.694
That is so sweet.
Is that a camera, nolan?

02:10.463 --> 02:12.598
What?!
A camera?

02:12.600 --> 02:15.601
That guy ripped me off!
What a bad man!

02:16.736 --> 02:18.737
Just once,
I'd like a bear
without a camera.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.342
Nolan, you really
gotta examine this obsession
you have with lacey.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.544
Once again, you're attracted
to someone who treats
you badly

02:25.546 --> 02:27.246
And validates
your low self-esteem.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.248
Really?
'cause I--

02:29.250 --> 02:32.718
Shut your loser hole.
He's trying to help you.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.886
Can I interject
something?

02:33.888 --> 02:35.654
See, I think
the first step

02:35.656 --> 02:38.490
To feeling better
about yourself is
looking better.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.259
I mean,
you could start

02:40.261 --> 02:42.594
By just making
a couple of changes.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.830
For example,
just--

02:44.832 --> 02:47.432
All of this and just
all of this.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.702
Patrick, getting
self-esteem is not as easy
as a change of clothes.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.805
It takes hard work
and it's a gradual process.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.641
Well,
as a personal shopper,

02:55.643 --> 02:58.443
I see clothes
transform people
every day.

02:58.445 --> 03:01.246
It's like therapy
except that it's faster

03:01.248 --> 03:03.782
And no one
wears black shoes
and white socks...

03:03.784 --> 03:05.651
Ed.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.655
Patrick, there's no reason
to praise

03:09.657 --> 03:11.657
One profession
at the expense of another.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.759
Even if one of those
professions is selling clothes

03:13.761 --> 03:17.296
Made by five-year-old,
crying, chinese girls.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.298
I wanna try to look good.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.933
Will you, uh,
help me, patrick?

03:20.935 --> 03:23.535
Well, I don't wanna
get in the way

03:23.537 --> 03:25.737
Of the glacial progress
you're making here,

03:25.739 --> 03:27.706
But, yeah, sure.
Let's give it a try.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.776
Did I mention
that sometimes they shoot
the girls for crying too hard?

03:32.845 --> 03:35.447
Sorry, dad.
Can I see you for a second?

03:35.449 --> 03:37.416
- It's about grandpa.
- Excuse me a second, guys.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.690
I know you're just
the messenger, but if this
is anything about

03:44.692 --> 03:46.391
Grapefruit or pudding,
I swear to god...

03:46.393 --> 03:48.560
- I just want you
to see something.
- Yeah.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.830
I don't know if
we should be worried
about grandpa or not,

03:51.832 --> 03:53.899
But I found this.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.904
Why would grandpa
put his shoes in
the refrigerator?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.772
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.875
- He's fine.
- Are you sure?

04:03.877 --> 04:05.244
Yeah--

04:05.246 --> 04:07.879
Yeah, it's an old
irish tradition.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.781
When you go to
someone's house,

04:09.783 --> 04:12.651
You put your shoes
in their fridge as a sign
of respect.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.388
Did you feel respected?

04:16.390 --> 04:18.857
So, why don't we
complete the tradition

04:18.859 --> 04:22.928
By taking these shoes
back up to grandpa's room

04:22.930 --> 04:25.497
And pretending like
this never happened.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.336
All:
â™ª to you.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.441
( cheering )

04:36.443 --> 04:38.710
In all my 65 years,

04:38.712 --> 04:40.512
I have never
been this happy.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.748
- I thought you were 72.
- The whole thing was a lie.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.783
You think I've never been
this happy?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.552
<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

04:47.554 --> 04:49.921
- Yeah.
- Don't you wanna answer that?

04:49.923 --> 04:52.891
Nah, just someone calling
to wish me a happy birthday

04:52.893 --> 04:54.826
And make another stupid
over-the-hill joke.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.829
"what was it like
to live when the dinosaurs
roamed the earth?"

04:57.831 --> 05:00.399
It was like-- mind your own
damn business, buster.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.802
- People are so rude.
- Yeah.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.538
But seriously,
what was it like?

05:06.540 --> 05:08.940
You know, a lot of times
the dinosaurs would kill

05:08.942 --> 05:11.643
The youngest member
of the family for being
a smart aleck.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.846
Sam, take your grandpa
and go watch that dvd
we got him.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.516
- I'll bring in the cake
and ice cream.
- Great.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.918
Can't wait to see
"grumpy old men" again.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.922
Digging through
the bargain bin by
the check-out counter.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.758
Nice to know
I'm worth a buck 99.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.963
So sam told me that martin
put his shoes in the fridge.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.066
That doesn't sound good.
Is he okay?

05:34.068 --> 05:37.035
He had a senior moment.
You're always blowing stuff
out of proportion.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.938
- People forget things.
- Yeah, I guess.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.773
When you were on the road
playing baseball,

05:41.775 --> 05:43.909
You used to forget
we were married.

05:43.911 --> 05:47.579
All right,
you got me.
We're even now.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.815
Guess we don't have to
talk about that anymore.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.818
Hey, excuse me.
I gotta hit the john
before we start the film.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.020
- Charlie, what are we animals?
- What?

05:55.022 --> 05:57.122
- You should put
a door on this thing.
- Dad, dad, dad.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.623
- Stop, stop.
It's not a bathroom.
- What?

05:58.625 --> 06:00.926
- It's not a bathroom.
- What?

06:00.928 --> 06:03.895
Oh, man.
I am really sorry.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.598
I guess I got
a little distracted.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.801
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just
really embarrassed

06:09.803 --> 06:12.738
And, uh, I still
have to go to
the bathroom.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.108
- There's one upstairs, right?
- Yeah, it's the room
without the beds.

06:18.511 --> 06:21.913
Charlie, you've really gotta
take your dad to the doctor.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.882
Could be something serious
like alzheimer's.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.852
Alzheimer's?
No, it's probably just
another one of his tricks.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.721
Maybe he wants something.
Maybe he wants to move in
with me.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.922
You're right.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.858
Maybe nobody
has alzheimer's

06:32.860 --> 06:35.560
And one out of five
old people just wanna
live with you.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.030
But I'm telling you, jen,
he just wants someone
to wait on him

06:39.032 --> 06:40.832
Hand and foot like
his ex-wife used to.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.467
You really think
he'd go that far?

06:42.469 --> 06:44.703
He'd pee in your pantry
just to fool you?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.471
He's from a generation
of people

06:46.473 --> 06:49.007
Who still knew
the value of hard work
and commitment.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.643
( mimics robert kennedy )
there are those who look at
a toilet and say, "why?"

06:51.645 --> 06:53.712
He looks at a pantry
and says, "why not?"

06:55.848 --> 06:57.916
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

07:00.620 --> 07:03.155
I really appreciate you
doing this for me, patrick.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.590
- I hope I don't let you down.
- <i>Are you kidding me?</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:07.125
You're every stylist's dream.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.561
You're a blank slate
with no style whatsoever.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.798
Thank you.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.201
All right, let's find out
who is in there.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.570
Give me one word
to describe yourself.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.739
Nolan.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.008
All right,
you're gonna have to go
a little bit deeper.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.510
( deep voice )
nolan.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.918
You know what,
I have a pretty good sense
of who you are,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.487
So let's just see
what we can do to
cover that up.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.088
Sounds good.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.695
There. Now that
is the kind of shirt

07:43.697 --> 07:45.497
The commands respect.

07:45.499 --> 07:49.034
Wow.
I respect it already.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.102
Here.
Put this on.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.140
Oh, my--
look at you.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.676
You already look like
a different man.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.479
Oh, my god.
I am.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.113
I look like ryan gosling.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.950
His assistant.
You sure do.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.985
See, when you
look better,

08:06.987 --> 08:09.821
You actually feel better
about yourself.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.090
You're right.
I do feel better.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.493
If I met myself
in a bar...

08:14.495 --> 08:16.628
I'd talk to me.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.197
All we need to do
is add this

08:19.199 --> 08:21.066
For just a splash
of color.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.969
Uh, I should of told you.
I-- I don't like ties.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.204
No, I know
it's a little formal,

08:26.206 --> 08:28.273
But now instead of
looking like a guy

08:28.275 --> 08:33.178
You'll look like
the guy in charge of a guy
who sells weed in an alley.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.948
I-- I--
I don't care.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.518
- Get-- get it off
of me, get it off of me.
- Would you just hold still?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.119
God, it's like
tarzan's first day
in the city.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.022
It's a tie.
It's not gonna
hurt you.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.758
I can't breathe!
( gasping )

08:46.760 --> 08:48.827
I can't breathe!

08:50.663 --> 08:52.731
( wailing )

08:52.733 --> 08:55.267
Well, now that we have learned
something about you,

08:55.269 --> 08:57.002
Here's something about me.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.904
I am very uncomfortable
when people cry.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.907
( wailing continues )

09:01.909 --> 09:04.175
Well, that is the last time
I ever open up to you.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.181
- Yo.
- Hi.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.183
So, how'd it go
at the doctors?

09:12.185 --> 09:15.186
Is your dad faking it
or does he really have
the 'heimer's?

09:15.188 --> 09:17.722
The 'heimer's?

09:17.724 --> 09:21.760
Real sensitive.
How's your mom's 'kemia?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.728
Oh, it's in remish.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.097
Look, it helps me to deal
with the heavy stuff

09:26.099 --> 09:28.600
By just giving it
a little nickname.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.101
That's how I function.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.336
I learned that
from a jewish friend

09:31.338 --> 09:33.572
Who lost his grandparents
in the 'caust.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.874
You even have a nickname
for the holocaust?

09:35.876 --> 09:38.276
No, he lost 'em
at costco.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.146
They wandered off.
They had the 'heimer's.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.050
So how's your dad?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.618
Well, we took him
to the doctor.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.987
He didn't do so well
on the cognitive stuff.

09:48.989 --> 09:52.023
That doesn't prove anything.
Tests are inconclusive.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.325
So there's no way
to know for sure?

09:53.327 --> 09:55.894
Not until they do
an autopsy.

09:55.896 --> 09:59.998
I tried to schedule one
for tomorrow, but,
you know, rules.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.069
- So what's the next step?
- I don't know, but my gut
tells me he's faking it.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.904
Maybe he tanked
the tests on purpose.

10:05.906 --> 10:09.975
What kind of son
are you if it turns out
he's really sick?

10:09.977 --> 10:13.678
The kind that will spend
the rest of my life wracked
with guilt.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.216
I can't wait
to find out.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.285
I need to know
if he's faking it now.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.755
Good luck with that.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.091
You're gonna have to watch
the guy all day to know
for sure.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.393
That's why I'm gonna use
this teddy spy cam.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.762
One of my patients
left it behind.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.897
Yeah, I got one
of those at home.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.200
I thought my housekeeper
was stealing from me.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.202
Is this the hot one?

10:37.204 --> 10:39.004
Oh, yeah.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.839
So was she
stealing from you?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.807
Not enough
to let her go.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.878
It's always an ethical dilemma
when the hot turn to crime.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.881
They belong in jail,
but they're so hot.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.387
It's a good thing they didn't
have hidden cameras like this
when I was younger.

10:55.389 --> 10:59.357
I'm sure my parents would have
used it to catch me doing
something wrong.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.725
You guys had
some trust issues?

11:00.727 --> 11:02.293
Yeah, and it
only got worse

11:02.295 --> 11:05.430
When they found out
I was sleeping with
a college professor.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.868
- You slept with a professor
while you were in college?
- No!

11:09.870 --> 11:13.805
I would never do that.
I was in high school.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.207
You are an endless
wellspring of wow.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.945
Thank you.
Can we go now?

11:20.947 --> 11:23.114
We've been watching
your father for an hour
and a half.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.383
All he's done
is eat some pudding,

11:25.385 --> 11:27.752
Do a crossword puzzle,
eat some more pudding.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.454
- This could take days.
- No, no, no, no.

11:29.456 --> 11:34.926
When I'm home it's all peeing
in the pantry and shoes
in the fridge,

11:34.928 --> 11:36.294
But look at him
right now.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.030
He's as normal
as you and me.
Well, me.

11:39.032 --> 11:43.068
I didn't have sex
with college professors
until I was in college.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.071
- But you're not gonna
see anything.
- Yes, I am.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.474
I'll see enough to prove
that my father's a big,
fat liar.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.310
He hasn't done one thing
out of the ordinary.

11:55.414 --> 11:59.150
He's using
an ice cream sandwich
as a remote control.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.486
( chuckles )
no, he's not.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.988
He's using

12:03.990 --> 12:06.224
An ice cream sandwich
as a remote control.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.165
Oh, my god.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.234
He's got
the 'heimer's.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.414
Too easy.

12:33.152 --> 12:35.220
<i>( car approaches )</i>

12:47.333 --> 12:49.367
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.103
- How you doing?
- I'm okay,

12:52.105 --> 12:54.973
But I think you need
to get a refund on this
subscription, though.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.942
They printed
the whole magazine
upside down.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.512
- Hold on. I think I have
an extra copy.
- Oh.

13:02.014 --> 13:05.183
Oh, thank you, son.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.985
- Mind if I have
a beer with ya?
- Not at all.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.420
- Please, join me.
- ( sighs )

13:20.032 --> 13:21.533
Listen,
I've been thinking.

13:21.535 --> 13:24.169
We should talk about you
coming to live with me.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.271
- Permanently.
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.973
I couldn't do that, son.
I mean, it's great fun
living here,

13:28.975 --> 13:31.042
But I have to get back
to my own place.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.278
I'm sorry, dad,
but it's just much safer
if you're here,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.346
- So I can keep
an eye on you.
-  <i>What happened?</i>

13:35.348 --> 13:37.382
Is it the results
from those tests?

13:37.384 --> 13:39.450
That doesn't mean anything.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.388
No, no.
You're sharp as ever.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.159
Just to be on the safe side,
I'm gonna go to your apartment

13:48.161 --> 13:52.230
You can't do that.
No, I'll never give up
my independence.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.266
By god, I fought in the war.
Incoming! Take cover!

13:55.268 --> 13:58.436
Take cover, son!
We gotta get outta here.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.472
All right, cease fire.
At ease, dad, at ease,
at ease.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.876
Come on, come on.
It's okay.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.911
- Oh.
- It's okay. It's all right,
come on.

14:06.913 --> 14:10.381
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
I get scared sometimes, son.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.016
It's okay.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.053
Why don't you sit down
and let me fix you
a club sandwich.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.622
With extra bacon?

14:17.624 --> 14:22.460
Yeah, because, you know,
I think I remember
I like it crispy.

14:30.569 --> 14:33.638
Oh, hey.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.207
Sorry,
I always

14:36.209 --> 14:39.210
Fall asleep after
a panic attack.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.113
Sucks when it happens
in a supermarket or a bank.

14:43.482 --> 14:47.252
Well, I don't
really know what
to do now.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.255
I guess I should ask you
if you wanna talk about it.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.190
I can't,
it's too painful.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.292
Oh, thank god.

14:54.294 --> 14:58.029
I have packed you
a to-go box, so I will
see you in group.

14:58.031 --> 15:02.433
- I guess it all started
with my dad.
- Oh, crap.

15:02.435 --> 15:06.437
He was an ex-marine
from texas. Scary man.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.973
There was
a seven grade dance

15:08.975 --> 15:11.042
And I didn't wanna go
'cause I was kinda
awkward back then.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.278
You? No.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.981
And my dad said
that I had to go to
the dance and meet girls.

15:16.983 --> 15:20.318
So I hid under the bed
and he pulled me out
by my tie

15:20.320 --> 15:23.421
And dragged me by my neck
all the way to the dance.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.957
Oh, my god.
That's awful.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.693
It's like some sort of
reverse "footloose."

15:28.695 --> 15:32.196
And to this day,
I can't wear a tie.

15:32.198 --> 15:35.566
- I'm feel like I'm choking.
- No, no, no, no.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.268
Don't do that.
We've done that already.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.305
Just tell me what I can do
to make it better.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.075
A hug would help.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.377
Yeah, so just let me know
if you think of anything.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.481
I'd like a hug, patrick.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.618
I'm sorry.
I don't do comfort.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.487
It's my issue.
I've just never
been really good

15:56.489 --> 15:59.057
Around other people's pain.
But I'm working on it, though.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.293
Okay, I understand.
I think I can drive home now.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.529
Great.
So...

16:04.531 --> 16:06.965
- Feel better.
- Thanks.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.336
No one has ever
listened to me without
being paid before.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.039
Okeydokey.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.710
- Okay, that's enough.
- Stay with it.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.713
You're doing great.
Ride it out, big guy.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.284
You brought this
on yourself, nolan.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.555
Didn't your father
have a whole collection
of watches?

16:30.557 --> 16:32.223
I can't find
them anywhere.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.125
Check the microwave?

16:34.127 --> 16:36.627
Like there's room in there
with all his socks.

16:36.629 --> 16:40.398
-  <i>( knocking on door )</i>
<i>- woman:</i> <i>Hello?</i>

16:40.400 --> 16:42.734
<i>We know you're in there,</i>
<i>martin. We can hear you.</i>

16:42.736 --> 16:45.703
Woman #2:
<i>Get your ass out here,</i>
<i>you coward!</i>

16:45.705 --> 16:49.674
Wow. Don't stiff
the girl scouts for cookies
in this neighborhood.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.479
45 years ago.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.384
You must be the girls
from troop one.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.153
- Who the hell are you?
- It's obviously his son.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.056
Look at him.
He's got martin's face.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.759
Maybe that's why
I wanna punch it.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.594
And to what do I owe
this pleasure?

17:09.596 --> 17:13.064
We need to see your father.
Martin, get out here!

17:13.066 --> 17:15.733
Whoa, slowdown.
What is going on?

17:15.735 --> 17:19.137
This young man's
father was having
a relationship with me.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.573
While we were waltzing
in the sheets down the hall.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.308
Hold on,
hold on.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.177
Are you telling me
that my dad, martin,

17:26.179 --> 17:29.747
The patron saint of monogamy,
was cheating with two women?

17:29.749 --> 17:32.683
Oh, my gosh.
You make total
sense now, charlie.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.786
Cheating is genetic.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.622
He's been avoiding us
ever since we found out
about each other.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.757
We confronted him
and he ran.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.727
We would have caught him,
but he went up some stairs.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.664
So you were the ones
that were calling
all the time.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.399
He's such a liar.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.501
He actually told us
he couldn't be
responsible

17:50.503 --> 17:52.603
For his actions 'cause
he had alzheimer's.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.173
- Geez, geez.
- Wow.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.809
How stupid would
someone have to be

17:57.811 --> 17:59.343
To believe a load
of crap like that?

17:59.345 --> 18:02.346
He's your dad, charlie.
You wanted to believe him.

18:02.348 --> 18:06.517
I wanna confront him,
but it might be too late.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.653
I hear he's getting pushed
out of his son's window
later this afternoon.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.460
- ( humming )
- hey, dad.

18:23.135 --> 18:26.370
- How was your day?
- Oh, not so good, son.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.873
I couldn't even find
the laundry room today.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.209
If a man can't do his own
laundry, what's left of him?

18:31.211 --> 18:34.112
I guess, I'll just have
to swallow my pride

18:34.114 --> 18:36.114
And let you do that
for me, too.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.818
Damn this disease.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.355
Dad, sit down.
I gotta talk to ya.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.557
You mean over there
on the sailboat?

18:46.559 --> 18:49.127
- Yes, on the sailboat.
- All right.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.234
- Ah-- that's the rowboat.
- Oh.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.202
Sorry.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.739
Listen,
I got some bad news

19:01.741 --> 19:04.375
And I know that
it's gonna be hard to hear.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.910
The results from
your blood work came back

19:05.912 --> 19:08.613
And they found some
kind of a rare bone disease.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.149
- What?
- I know, I know.

19:11.151 --> 19:15.153
I couldn't believe it either,
but there is something
they can do.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.854
It's a marrow procedure

19:16.856 --> 19:18.823
That's extremely painful

19:18.825 --> 19:22.627
And takes a very, very,
very long time.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.428
Oh, my god.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.531
But here's
the good news.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.901
There is one day a week
where you're not strapped down
to the machine,

19:29.903 --> 19:32.270
But you spend most
of that day in the bathroom.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.208
So you found out about
elaine and barbara, huh?

19:37.210 --> 19:38.910
And you found out
about the teddy cam.

19:38.912 --> 19:41.579
I saw it in
a skymall magazine.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.181
Anyone who's ever
gotten on a plane

19:43.183 --> 19:47.185
Without any reading material
could've figured that one out.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.787
Dad, I gotta tell you.
What you did was disgusting.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.857
Oh, come on.
Barb's not that bad
and elaine's got directv.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.826
I'm talking about
faking alzheimer's.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.495
Why didn't you
just tell me you needed
a place to hide out?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.896
Oh, charlie.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.399
I've always ridden you
so hard for being
a womanizer.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.801
I didn't wanna give you
the impression that I was,

20:03.803 --> 20:05.903
- You know a...
- Hypocrite?

20:05.905 --> 20:09.674
Hey, just because you
say one thing and do another,
doesn't make you a hypocrite.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.610
Can we continue this
conversation upstairs
near a window?

20:12.612 --> 20:15.246
Look, I never meant
for this to happen.
Believe me.

20:15.248 --> 20:18.249
I had real feelings
for both of them and
I just couldn't choose.

20:18.251 --> 20:21.986
See, barbara's a diabetic
and elaine's got melanoma,

20:21.988 --> 20:25.323
So I was kinda hoping
god would choose for me.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.757
Well, he didn't.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.293
So now you gotta go
back there and deal
with them.

20:29.295 --> 20:32.263
Oh, no.
After what I've done,
they're both so angry.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.865
- I just don't know
if I can handle it.
- You won't have to do it alone.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.235
Luckily, your son is
an anger management therapist.

20:37.237 --> 20:40.004
- I'll even mediate.
- You'd really do that for me?

20:40.006 --> 20:43.674
I remember a dad
who was always there
when his kid got in a jam.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.477
- Mr. Kellerman down the street.
- Yeah, I'm gonna do
this for him.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.983
Oh, charlie.
They're gonna kill me.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.586
Dad, don't worry.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.421
Sure, they're gonna
wanna yell at you
and humiliate you

20:57.423 --> 20:58.923
And maybe even
throw some stuff,

20:58.925 --> 21:01.325
But none of that
will happen as long
as I'm here.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.394
- Oh.
- <i>( knocking on door )</i>

21:11.036 --> 21:13.271
Barb. Elaine.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.039
He's all yours.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.009
Wait a sec!
No, no, wait a minute.
I didn't... Charlie!
