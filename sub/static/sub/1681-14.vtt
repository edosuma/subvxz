00:01.630 --> 00:04.828
I can't believe Metro News One is just
forwarding you all this fan mail now.

00:05.075 --> 00:06.760
I know. I quit like four months ago.

00:06.885 --> 00:08.892
You had more fans than I thought.

00:09.136 --> 00:11.652
And only about 60%
of them are prison inmates.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.233
What are these guys thinking?

00:14.442 --> 00:16.813
I am way past
my "dating prisoners" phase.

00:16.938 --> 00:19.508
It's like, hello,
I'm not 19 anymore.

00:21.508 --> 00:24.378
- Lottery Girl's on.
- I just feel sorry for these women.

00:24.505 --> 00:26.612
This is where broadcast careers
go to die.

00:27.050 --> 00:28.471
Check it out. I make it fun.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.415
I invented a little game.

00:31.047 --> 00:33.127
<i>Tonight's Lotto numbers are...</i>

00:35.673 --> 00:36.707
<i>19...</i>

00:37.033 --> 00:38.283
Age you moved to New York

00:38.408 --> 00:40.486
after a photographer "discovered"
you at a food court

00:40.612 --> 00:42.363
and said he'd get you
in Vogue magazine.

00:42.532 --> 00:43.284
<i>53...</i>

00:43.452 --> 00:45.240
Number of semi-nude pictures
he took of you

00:45.365 --> 00:48.016
<i>before you realized he had
no connection to Vogue magazine.</i>

00:48.718 --> 00:49.526
<i>22...</i>

00:49.695 --> 00:51.328
Age you claim you are.

00:51.613 --> 00:52.417
<i>31...</i>

00:52.811 --> 00:54.260
Age you actually are.

00:54.850 --> 00:55.767
<i>45...</i>

00:56.012 --> 00:58.401
Number of minutes it would take me
to get you into a cab,

00:58.527 --> 01:00.949
out of your dress,
and into my jacuzzi.

01:01.276 --> 01:03.098
<i>And tonight's Super Big Ball is...</i>

01:03.360 --> 01:05.832
What happens after
we get out of the jacuzzi.

01:05.958 --> 01:06.743
What up?

01:08.545 --> 01:10.935
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

01:21.870 --> 01:25.594
<i>Kids, by the winter of 2009,
Robin had been unemployed for months.</i>

01:26.246 --> 01:27.989
<i>But there was a glimmer of hope.</i>

01:28.115 --> 01:30.160
- Hey.
- How'd the audition go?

01:30.329 --> 01:32.766
Well, I went in there
feeling really good.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.395
I heard it was just me up
against two other girls.

01:35.564 --> 01:36.695
Listening.

01:43.847 --> 01:45.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:48.807 --> 01:49.723
And you are?

01:51.624 --> 01:53.744
You've obviously never spent
any time in Denver.

01:54.192 --> 01:56.108
Rochelle Harper, News Center 12.

01:56.521 --> 01:59.462
We were only the number-one
station in the Rockies for

01:59.588 --> 02:00.907
five straight years.

02:01.312 --> 02:03.882
I was an anchor here in town
at Metro News One.

02:05.008 --> 02:05.850
An anchor.

02:06.815 --> 02:09.244
You must have
a killer sign off phrase.

02:09.413 --> 02:10.164
Sorry?

02:10.334 --> 02:12.176
You gotta have
a killer sign off phrase.

02:12.470 --> 02:14.121
Like Walter Cronkite:

02:14.550 --> 02:16.394
"And that's the way it is."

02:17.008 --> 02:18.523
So what's yours?

02:18.955 --> 02:21.536
Well, I would just
always end with a simple

02:21.661 --> 02:24.541
"From all of us here at Metro News One,
have a good evening."

02:29.210 --> 02:30.049
Mine is:

02:30.174 --> 02:33.205
"From all of us here
at Barney's apartment, get out."

02:34.588 --> 02:37.729
You didn't let those reporter bitches
psych you out, did you?

02:38.777 --> 02:40.745
... and the President's
economic team

02:40.913 --> 02:43.357
is hoping to have a proposal
before Congress

02:43.652 --> 02:45.035
by the end of the month.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.743
From all of us here at News Ten,
have a good evening.

02:52.935 --> 02:54.569
So, good night, New York.

02:55.005 --> 02:57.721
And may the road ahead
be lit with dreams

02:57.939 --> 02:59.262
and tomorrows.

03:00.537 --> 03:02.322
Which are lit with dreams...

03:02.879 --> 03:03.884
also.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.119
That's terrible.

03:07.467 --> 03:08.481
And bad...

03:08.963 --> 03:09.967
also.

03:10.735 --> 03:11.702
I wasn't done.

03:13.225 --> 03:14.717
Stand tall, New York.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.493
Trust worthy.

03:16.928 --> 03:18.085
Recycling.

03:19.744 --> 03:20.958
Wear a condom.

03:22.832 --> 03:24.391
Wear a condom?

03:25.380 --> 03:27.538
I'm not gonna be the new
Channel Ten anchor, am I?

03:28.110 --> 03:29.191
This just in.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.933
<i>Maybe the problem is your résumé.</i>

03:34.300 --> 03:37.465
See how mine is lean and mean?
Yours is too cluttered.

03:37.754 --> 03:40.061
Oh, like everything
on your résumé is so relevant?

03:40.687 --> 03:44.670
"Program Director,
88.1 Wesleyan University Radio"?

03:44.838 --> 03:46.676
- Oh, God.
- Dr. X?

03:46.802 --> 03:48.943
You're still bragging about Dr. X?

03:49.068 --> 03:51.308
- Who was Dr. X?
- Nobody knows.

03:51.554 --> 03:54.515
- He was this genius mystery D.J.
- It was Ted.

03:54.684 --> 03:56.842
His identity
remains a secret to this day.

03:56.967 --> 03:57.865
It was Ted.

03:58.221 --> 04:01.553
But this phantom of the airwaves
changed the very face of college radio.

04:01.721 --> 04:03.563
- It was Ted.
- And your show sucked.

04:04.821 --> 04:08.786
<i>Dr. X here, shooting truth bullets
at you from an undisclosed location.</i>

04:09.326 --> 04:12.414
<i>Because if they knew where I was,
they'd shut me down.</i>

04:12.540 --> 04:14.600
You're on the third floor
of the Student Center

04:14.726 --> 04:16.737
next to the game room, you tool.

04:16.863 --> 04:18.865
<i>I've been getting a lot of letters
about my segment</i>

04:18.991 --> 04:21.408
<i>on how racist
the school's meal plan is.</i>

04:21.683 --> 04:24.599
How are you getting letters if no one
knows where you are, douche?

04:24.886 --> 04:26.659
<i>That's why
I'm organizing a happening </i>

04:26.784 --> 04:29.032
<i>outside the dining hall,
Monday at midnight.</i>

04:29.467 --> 04:31.839
<i>It's high time the Food Service
puppet masters</i>

04:32.007 --> 04:34.484
<i>took ignorance
and injustice off the menu.</i>

04:35.284 --> 04:36.949
<i>Ted, we need a fourth for foosball.</i>

04:37.871 --> 04:40.314
<i>- What are you doing in here, anyway?
- Dude, get out of here!</i>

04:40.440 --> 04:41.730
<i>I'll be there in a second.</i>

04:42.400 --> 04:44.924
<i>So remember, dining hall,
Monday, midnight.</i>

04:45.049 --> 04:47.204
<i>Another Dr. X happening.</i>

04:47.610 --> 04:50.945
<i>I'll be there, because X
marks the spot-ot-ot-ot-ot...</i>

04:52.702 --> 04:56.219
If you think people liked your show,
they did not-ot-ot-ot...

04:56.970 --> 04:59.948
This is weird. Look
what got mixed in with your fan mail.

05:00.116 --> 05:01.576
- What?
- It's from the U.S.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.173
Department of Immigration.

05:04.953 --> 05:07.123
It's postmarked two months ago.

05:12.425 --> 05:14.148
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

05:14.317 --> 05:15.809
It's about my work visa.

05:15.935 --> 05:18.214
Unless I can find
a job in the next...

05:19.187 --> 05:22.023
seven days, they're gonna
send me back to Canada.

05:28.539 --> 05:30.768
I can't believe you might be
kicked out of the country.

05:30.893 --> 05:33.363
I know. My whole life is here.

05:33.488 --> 05:36.476
No. We won't let this happen.
One of us will help you find a job.

05:36.645 --> 05:39.095
Yeah, I bet I can get you
something at my school.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.543
No, guys...

05:41.038 --> 05:42.120
It doesn't work.

05:42.246 --> 05:44.728
Robin only gets her work visa
if she gets a job in her field.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.166
You know what, I guess you could stay
if you married a U.S. citizen.

05:50.021 --> 05:51.800
Yeah, that could work.

05:52.423 --> 05:55.162
Oh, no. They could never process that
and make it official in time.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.595
That won't work.

05:56.721 --> 05:57.912
I'm screwed.

05:58.037 --> 06:00.186
I've been sending out my reel
for 3 months, and nothing.

06:00.801 --> 06:03.704
Maybe there's something in your reel
that people aren't responding to.

06:03.873 --> 06:05.507
Let's take a look at it, right?

06:08.872 --> 06:10.327
That's a good question, Norm.

06:10.452 --> 06:12.508
The first thing is from
when I was a cub reporter

06:12.634 --> 06:14.921
for Channel 22 in Red Deer.

06:15.638 --> 06:16.861
In Alberta.

06:17.541 --> 06:18.409
In Canada.

06:21.871 --> 06:24.125
Well, the snow's coming down
pretty hard,

06:24.250 --> 06:27.557
but these intrepid fishermen
are still happy to be out competing

06:27.683 --> 06:30.639
in Lake Athabasca's
Bass Fishing Jamboree,

06:30.765 --> 06:32.731
an August 1st tradition.

06:33.264 --> 06:34.703
Back to you, Norm.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.245
What? That was my first job.

06:40.495 --> 06:41.993
It shows where I came from.

06:42.118 --> 06:44.350
Unless a bear attacks you
in the next three seconds

06:44.475 --> 06:47.837
and you snap its neck with your legs,
that has no business being on your reel.

06:47.963 --> 06:50.521
No, no, I get it, I get it.

06:50.893 --> 06:53.085
Where you're from
is part of who you're selling.

06:53.211 --> 06:54.899
For instance, under "special skills"

06:55.024 --> 06:56.493
<i>on my résumé, I mention that</i>

06:56.618 --> 07:00.005
back in Minnesota, I was the 1995
Nicollet County Slam Dunk Champion.

07:00.174 --> 07:02.477
<i>You put dunk champion
on your résumé?</i>

07:02.645 --> 07:03.991
Yeah, why wouldn't you?

07:04.116 --> 07:06.763
A lot of companies
have basketball teams.

07:06.888 --> 07:08.792
It's good for them
to know that VanillaThunder

07:08.918 --> 07:10.520
can still take the rock to the hole.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.494
- They called you Vanilla Thunder?
- Yeah, Vanilla Thunder.

07:14.822 --> 07:17.254
The Ghost in the Post.
The Human Turnstile.

07:17.514 --> 07:19.491
I didn't...
I didn't play that much D.

07:20.186 --> 07:21.411
You can't still dunk.

07:21.829 --> 07:23.372
Of course I can.

07:23.647 --> 07:24.905
Well, I mean I could...

07:25.030 --> 07:27.653
- until... until recently.
- Until the injury.

07:28.536 --> 07:30.334
It's called iliopsoas tendonitis.

07:30.582 --> 07:32.292
Oh, Yikes. That sounds bad.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.523
It's more commonly known
as dancer's hip.

07:39.242 --> 07:40.391
Dr. Goodman...

07:42.268 --> 07:43.272
Oh, come on!

07:44.354 --> 07:47.718
Iliopsoas tendonitis. That's what
it's called. That's all it's called.

07:49.163 --> 07:52.602
Iliopsoas tendonitis.
It's a basketball injury.

07:52.727 --> 07:54.227
You know, it's no big whoop.

07:54.352 --> 07:57.312
Dancer's hip, Marshall has something
called dancer's hip.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.364
OK, no, no.
They only call it that, look

07:59.533 --> 08:02.136
because it's very common
with ballet dancers.

08:04.811 --> 08:07.565
So, tell me,
do any of the other little girls

08:07.690 --> 08:09.502
in your class have dancer's hip?

08:09.772 --> 08:11.997
- Yeah, sure.
- I have more of a technical question.

08:12.123 --> 08:15.325
Is it easier to dance when
you don't have external genitalia?

08:15.601 --> 08:17.781
Good, don't build to that,
just go right for it.

08:18.232 --> 08:21.519
Guys, come on. Marshall
didn't get this injury from dancing.

08:21.787 --> 08:23.036
Thank you, Lily.

08:23.161 --> 08:25.828
Clearly, the stirrups were set
a little too wide

08:25.954 --> 08:28.144
during his last trip to the gyno.

08:28.502 --> 08:30.845
Guys, I hate to cut you off

08:31.182 --> 08:34.885
before Marshall bursts into tears,
but, Robin, check this out.

08:35.010 --> 08:38.614
<i>What you need
is an awesome video résumé.</i>

08:39.352 --> 08:42.159
Like mine.
I present:

08:43.727 --> 08:46.973
Barneysvideoresume.com.

09:04.309 --> 09:05.206
Hello.

09:05.331 --> 09:09.070
<i>Barney Stinson, you've achieved
great success in business,</i>

09:09.195 --> 09:11.583
<i>athletics and personal relationships</i>

09:11.709 --> 09:13.846
<i>and have been an inspiration
to many people.</i>

09:14.713 --> 09:15.777
Is that you?

09:16.376 --> 09:18.160
Are you interviewing yourself?

09:18.784 --> 09:21.308
How can it be me?
That guy's British.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.460
<i>What would you recommend
to your numerous admirers</i>

09:25.586 --> 09:27.935
<i>who want to reach
their highest potential?</i>

09:28.060 --> 09:29.722
And a wee bit Scottish.

09:31.531 --> 09:33.807
The first thing you need to know
about success

09:33.932 --> 09:35.670
is that it doesn't just come to you.

09:36.041 --> 09:39.032
Most people associate success
with money and power,

09:39.372 --> 09:41.778
but really it's a state of mind.

09:44.288 --> 09:46.353
You had to be
on a motorcycle to say that?

09:47.457 --> 09:51.295
And when it comes to success the only
limit is that there are no limits.

09:52.636 --> 09:55.402
I didn't know you knew how to stand
near a horse; that's impressive.

09:55.687 --> 09:58.796
Barney, I don't get it. You don't do
a damn thing in any of these clips.

09:58.922 --> 10:01.584
Exactly. Because that's who
corporate American wants...

10:01.812 --> 10:04.485
people who seem
like bold risk takers,

10:04.611 --> 10:06.401
but never actually do anything.

10:06.622 --> 10:09.074
Actually doing things
gets you fired.

10:09.452 --> 10:12.365
In fact, I'm writing a book
on this very phenomenon.

10:12.537 --> 10:13.708
Really?

10:13.878 --> 10:16.388
No, that would be doing some...
Are you even listening?

10:18.127 --> 10:20.916
All my life, I have dared to go

10:21.181 --> 10:22.871
past what is possible.

10:23.328 --> 10:25.266
To the impossible?

10:25.777 --> 10:27.478
Actually, past that...

10:27.997 --> 10:31.872
to the place where the possible
and the impossible meet

10:31.998 --> 10:32.893
to become...

10:34.252 --> 10:35.470
the possimpible.

10:37.377 --> 10:38.776
The possimpible?
Really?

10:38.902 --> 10:41.936
Inventing your own word shows
creativity and vision...

10:42.667 --> 10:44.035
"Vizha-tivity."

10:46.247 --> 10:49.481
If I can leave you
with one thought, it's this:

10:50.515 --> 10:51.520
Nothing...

10:51.958 --> 10:53.245
and everything...

10:54.047 --> 10:55.388
is possimpible.

10:58.719 --> 11:00.247
<i>That guy's awesome</i>

11:00.416 --> 11:01.694
Is that you agai...?

11:02.006 --> 11:04.310
Are you singing a song
about yourself?

11:04.575 --> 11:07.160
Absolutely not.
That would be lame.

11:08.082 --> 11:10.552
<i>Stinson, Barney Stinson</i>

11:10.744 --> 11:12.769
<i>singing this song</i>

11:12.894 --> 11:14.449
<i>That would be really lame</i>

11:14.617 --> 11:18.635
<i>One of the many admirers
who think that guy's awesome</i>

11:19.157 --> 11:20.564
<i>Perfect and available</i>

11:20.865 --> 11:23.831
<i>Awesome, awesome, awesome,
awesome, awesome, awesome...</i>

11:24.296 --> 11:26.848
<i>Awesome, awesome</i>

11:42.181 --> 11:44.526
That baby got me 11 job offers.

11:45.902 --> 11:46.872
No way.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.145
Barney, that was
ridiculous and insane.

11:49.283 --> 11:50.450
Insane-ulous.

11:52.403 --> 11:53.993
- Make me one.
- What?

11:54.181 --> 11:57.303
- Yes, now you're talking.
- What? I'm about to be deported.

11:57.471 --> 12:00.150
- I'll try anything.
- Okay, we better get started.

12:00.334 --> 12:03.538
There's a lot to shoot, I can't use any
of the footage I already have of you.

12:03.663 --> 12:06.028
What footage do you
already have of me?

12:06.640 --> 12:08.204
Let's just get started.

12:10.776 --> 12:14.393
Sweetie. Are you still upset about
the dancer's hip jokes?

12:17.230 --> 12:20.341
We were just kidding.
We all know it's a basketball injury.

12:20.512 --> 12:21.843
Yeah, totally.

12:25.580 --> 12:28.385
- I have something I need to tell you.
- What is it?

12:30.197 --> 12:32.102
I dance more than you know.

12:33.704 --> 12:34.459
What?

12:35.575 --> 12:36.613
I dance...

12:37.770 --> 12:39.118
more than you know.

12:41.837 --> 12:44.125
I don't know how to respond to that.

12:47.466 --> 12:50.069
What does being
a reporter mean to you?

12:50.943 --> 12:53.664
- Well, ever since I was a little kid...
- Cut!

12:54.768 --> 12:56.906
You're getting bogged down
in specifics.

12:57.031 --> 12:59.847
I need you to just say vague,

12:59.972 --> 13:03.238
confident-sounding buzzwords,
like "synergy" and "dynamism".

13:03.832 --> 13:06.529
You can make up a word, like...
"linkativity."

13:07.085 --> 13:10.108
How will sounding like an idiot
get me hired anywhere?

13:10.468 --> 13:11.993
Okay, fine.
Don't do it.

13:12.633 --> 13:15.804
Anyway, there are plenty of exciting
stories to cover back in Canada.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.443
I just read that
the mayor of Winnipeg's nephew

13:18.568 --> 13:21.331
went ice fishing and caught
himself a 16-pound walleye.

13:21.457 --> 13:25.068
Reporting live from the worst place
in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

13:26.422 --> 13:27.855
Fine. Roll camera.

13:31.734 --> 13:33.776
- Connectitude.
- Love it.

13:34.587 --> 13:36.080
Transformatation.

13:36.276 --> 13:37.085
Earn it!

13:37.280 --> 13:38.300
Linkativity.

13:39.536 --> 13:41.225
Yeah, linkativity's mine.

13:45.011 --> 13:47.558
So, how much dancing
are we talking about?

13:47.728 --> 13:49.190
I don't... I guess

13:49.563 --> 13:50.568
I'd say...

13:51.440 --> 13:52.456
medium.

13:53.385 --> 13:55.853
Why are you dancing so much,
and why don't I know about it?

13:56.466 --> 13:59.819
It's something I do when I'm alone.
Like if something good happens,

13:59.944 --> 14:01.865
I get excited and I need
to move, and I just...

14:01.991 --> 14:04.271
I don't know. I don't want
to even talk about this anymore.

14:06.287 --> 14:08.252
So that's how you injured your hip?

14:10.364 --> 14:13.256
Hey, did you hear?
They're giving us a half day today.

14:13.381 --> 14:14.805
We can leave at 2:00.

14:15.759 --> 14:17.461
Great!
Thanks, Herm.

14:28.023 --> 14:29.616
These costumes are ridiculous.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.924
Plus, the Amazon Warrior
Princess armor gave me a rash.

14:33.534 --> 14:36.674
Cards on the table. You weren't
the first lady to wear that in here.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.041
But it conveyed power.
And so will this.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.857
What I need you to do now...

14:40.982 --> 14:42.950
is break these 15 bricks
with your forehead.

14:43.076 --> 14:43.833
What?

14:43.959 --> 14:45.904
But you didn't do a damn thing
in your video.

14:46.029 --> 14:49.083
You just stood near a horse
and sat on a motorcycle.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.802
That's because I'm a man.

14:50.928 --> 14:53.578
You're a woman. The assumption
is that you can't do anything.

14:54.006 --> 14:55.965
But you have to prove society wrong.

14:56.134 --> 14:59.148
I can't break 15 bricks
with my forehead.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.631
It's not 1950 anymore.
Yes, you can.

15:04.882 --> 15:06.857
- I'm out of here.
- What? Why?

15:07.026 --> 15:08.886
None of this is going to help me
get a job.

15:09.012 --> 15:11.452
I'm about to get kicked out
of the country.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.104
I know what I have to do.

15:17.698 --> 15:19.830
Is this where the Lottery Girl
auditions are?

15:19.956 --> 15:21.385
Yeah, right here.

15:25.110 --> 15:27.382
<i>So, your Aunt Robin
had reached her low point.</i>

15:27.909 --> 15:30.357
<i>She was auditioning to be
the Lottery Girl.</i>

15:30.879 --> 15:33.038
And tonight's Lotto numbers are...

15:33.208 --> 15:35.875
Hold it. Say the line
before you press the button.

15:36.141 --> 15:38.584
- It builds the suspense.
- It builds the suspense.

15:41.282 --> 15:43.393
And tonight's Lotto numbers are...

15:47.403 --> 15:48.329
seventeen...

15:48.502 --> 15:49.959
- Stop her.
- Hold it.

15:50.424 --> 15:52.147
Why did she say it like that?

15:52.272 --> 15:55.072
It's like she's not even happy
about the 17 coming up.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.168
She seems mean.

15:57.293 --> 15:58.983
Yeah, she seems super-mean.

15:59.743 --> 16:01.733
Can you take
another run at "17" for us?

16:03.915 --> 16:04.749
Seventeen.

16:05.821 --> 16:07.968
I don't even understand
what she's doing.

16:09.226 --> 16:10.650
Let me try something.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.685
Try being a little more wry.

16:14.748 --> 16:17.191
Wry?
About the number 17?

16:17.387 --> 16:19.297
Wry, with a little bit of a...

16:19.711 --> 16:21.226
- Twinkle.
- ... twinkle.

16:22.472 --> 16:23.642
Seventeen.

16:25.889 --> 16:27.077
That was great!

16:28.812 --> 16:32.825
I got you a light beer. I know how you
dancers are always counting calories.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.030
It's not funny, all right?
The doctor says

16:35.155 --> 16:37.165
if it gets any worse,
I might need surgery.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.289
Vaginal rejuvenation surgery?

16:39.646 --> 16:42.551
You know who didn't do a lot of
operating on vaginas in college?

16:42.677 --> 16:43.707
- Who?
- Dr. X.

16:44.022 --> 16:45.635
He did just fine!

16:45.804 --> 16:47.490
You know what?
Both of you geniuses

16:47.615 --> 16:50.848
<i>need to take that weak-ass
crap off your résumés.</i>

16:50.975 --> 16:53.506
I mean, you are not Dr. X anymore,

16:53.632 --> 16:55.371
and you cannot dunk anymore.

16:55.915 --> 16:56.755
Let it go.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.014
So Marshall and I are the only
people at this table

16:59.140 --> 17:01.134
<i>with "weak-ass crap" on their résumés.</i>

17:01.303 --> 17:02.600
What are you implying?

17:04.906 --> 17:05.832
I don't know!

17:05.957 --> 17:09.971
Does the date July 4, 1995
mean anything to you?

17:10.141 --> 17:11.676
You son of a bitch.

17:16.507 --> 17:17.535
Time!

17:17.661 --> 17:19.922
And the new champion,
with 29 hot dogs,

17:20.048 --> 17:22.594
Lily "The Belly" Aldrin.

17:28.611 --> 17:31.086
How is that relevant
to teaching kindergarten?

17:31.255 --> 17:33.001
It teaches kids that...

17:33.395 --> 17:36.628
I can eat a lot of
hot dogs very quickly.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.507
Yeah, but you can't do it anymore!

17:38.633 --> 17:40.794
You can't dunk anymore, Ladyhips!

17:41.208 --> 17:43.108
How dare you!
These hips can...

17:43.278 --> 17:44.472
Guys, guys!

17:45.414 --> 17:47.297
I didn't even get
the Lotto Girl gig.

17:49.081 --> 17:50.942
I have to move back to Canada.

17:52.824 --> 17:54.083
I can't believe this.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.566
I remember the night
before I moved down here.

17:59.266 --> 18:00.912
They threw
a going-away party for me.

18:01.739 --> 18:05.143
They gave me a camera so I could
take pictures and send them home.

18:07.013 --> 18:10.579
And everyone was so sure
I was gonna be such a big success.

18:13.247 --> 18:15.214
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

18:18.252 --> 18:19.337
What happened?

18:20.134 --> 18:22.066
Robin has to move back to Canada.

18:22.395 --> 18:23.823
Oh, my God. How awful.

18:25.251 --> 18:27.721
I mean, for one thing
it's gonna be a really long commute.

18:28.062 --> 18:29.556
What do you mean?

18:29.682 --> 18:31.627
I finished your video resume
on my own.

18:31.752 --> 18:33.921
Messengered it to every station
in the city.

18:34.075 --> 18:35.958
A guy from Channel Eight called.

18:36.084 --> 18:37.213
He loved you.

18:37.339 --> 18:39.159
He wanted you to come in
and audition.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.163
My God!

18:40.332 --> 18:41.293
I told him no.

18:41.419 --> 18:43.493
Robin Scherbatsky doesn't audition.

18:43.618 --> 18:45.440
He gives you the job or nothing.

18:45.612 --> 18:48.290
- So I got the job?
- No. He cursed me out and hung up.

18:50.401 --> 18:52.219
But then Channel 12 called.

18:52.345 --> 18:54.292
They also loved you.

18:54.417 --> 18:57.672
They offered you a job hosting
their new morning talk show.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.563
- Barney, that's amazing!
- I told them to shove it.

19:00.732 --> 19:03.938
- Dude!
- Which only made them want you more.

19:04.255 --> 19:06.699
So, they jacked up their offer
by ten percent.

19:06.825 --> 19:08.231
Congratulations.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.701
It looks like
you're gonna have to stay.

19:18.011 --> 19:20.662
- You're not about to dance, are you?
- I'm good.

19:20.787 --> 19:21.882
I'll do it later.

19:24.610 --> 19:26.271
How did you pull this off?

19:26.726 --> 19:28.840
I am the master of the possimpible.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.542
You really are.

19:31.247 --> 19:32.108
Thank you.

19:34.917 --> 19:38.056
<i>So, thanks to your Uncle Barney,
we got to keep your Aunt Robin.</i>

19:47.776 --> 19:51.168
<i>And the rest of us decided
it was time to let some things go.</i>

19:56.196 --> 19:57.625
<i>Well, except for Lily.</i>

19:57.750 --> 20:00.929
You got this.
And... time!

20:01.097 --> 20:02.578
What's the count?

20:03.451 --> 20:04.487
Thirty-three!

20:36.320 --> 20:38.964
Why is no one coming
to my Happenings?
