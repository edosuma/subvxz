Wow, what's
with the champagne?

19:40.379 --> 19:42.013
Stole it from Russell.

19:42.013 --> 19:44.550
You took a prop
from the photo shoot?

19:44.550 --> 19:45.584
No, I...

19:45.584 --> 19:47.853
broke into
his wine cellar.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.889
So, what are we
drinking to?

19:50.889 --> 19:54.560
How about to us
setting a wedding date?

19:54.560 --> 19:55.160

19:55.160 --> 19:57.263
Yeah, I'm thinking

19:57.263 --> 20:00.999
Why, is your biological
clock ticking?

20:01.400 --> 20:02.368
No. No. It's just,

20:02.368 --> 20:04.503
I saw all these fake wedding
pictures from today,

20:04.503 --> 20:08.540
and it...made me wanna
marry you. For real.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.310
Adam, that's so nice.
[CHUCKLES]

20:11.310 --> 20:14.846
But that doesn't give us
enough time to plan.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.082
Okay, well, then next summer.
Deal.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.017
Deal.

20:32.531 --> 20:33.565

20:33.565 --> 20:36.034

That necklace
is so beautiful.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.430
It is. It was
such a surprise.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.064
He gave it to me in the new car.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.033
Mm-hm-hm.
I bet he did.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.802
Don't be disgusting.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.471

You're getting married,

21:18.444 --> 21:19.811

21:19.811 --> 21:21.580
It'll be the same as Adam's.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.315
I might not
change it to his.

21:23.315 --> 21:26.217
You should. Jennifer Roman
sounds pretty good.

21:26.217 --> 21:28.854
My last name's Rhodes.

21:29.688 --> 21:32.391
