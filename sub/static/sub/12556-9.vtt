HM.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.556
MRS. TEMPLETON IS NOT
VERY DISCREET THESE DAYS,

01:47.649 --> 01:49.310
IS SHE?

01:49.401 --> 01:52.610
WELL, HER DISCRETION
WAS AN EARLY FATALITY.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.528
IT DIDN'T
LAST VERY LONG.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.277
PERHAPS SHE'S
WAITING FOR THE DAY

01:57.367 --> 01:58.653
WHEN THESE WON'T DO

01:58.744 --> 02:00.906
WHAT THEY'RE
DESIGNED TO DO.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.738
PERHAPS I'M WAITING
FOR THAT DAY, TOO.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.324
MR. TEMPLETON, YOU
SHOULDN'T SAY THAT.

02:06.418 --> 02:09.001
OH, DON'T DISTRESS
YOURSELF, OLD FRIEND.

VVHEN A MAN MY AGE MARRIES
A VVOMAN HER AGE,

WHAT HE DESERVES.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.634
I'M OLD, MARTY.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.386
<i>(Marty) OH, MR- TEMPLETON,
YOU OOULD NEVER BE OLD.</i>

02:23.477 --> 02:25.514
OLD AND GETTING OLDER

02:25.604 --> 02:29.689
EVERY MINUTE THAT WE
STAND HERE SPEAKING.

02:29.775 --> 02:33.268
THEY SAY, OR AT LEAST
THEY'VE SAID IT

02:33.362 --> 02:34.944
IN MOST OF MY PLAYS,

02:35.030 --> 02:37.943
THAT WHEN A MAN
ACHIEVES YEARS

02:38.033 --> 02:42.698
HE ACHIEVES REASON
AND CONTENTMENT.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.074
I HAVEN'T.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.700
MR. TEMPLETON,
MAY I SUGGEST

02:45.791 --> 02:47.702
THAT POSSIBLY
THIS ISN'T THE DAY

02:47.793 --> 02:49.329
FOR YOU TO GO
DOWN THERE?

02:49.419 --> 02:51.501
PERHAPS I SHOULD
TELEPHONE THE THEATER

02:51.588 --> 02:54.330
AND EXPLAIN THAT YOU
CAN'T START REHEARSALS.

02:54.424 --> 02:58.509
VVELL, THANK YOU, MARTY,
BUT I'LL GO DOVVN THERE.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.680

I SHALL COVER UP THE
YEARS VVITH MAKEUP,

03:06.019 --> 03:09.102
AND I SHALL STAND
IN THE RIGHT PLACES

03:09.189 --> 03:11.681
AND HOPE TO SAY
THE RIGHT LINES

03:11.775 --> 03:15.268
AND, VVHEN IT'S OVER,
THEY'LL ALL SAY TO ME,

03:15.362 --> 03:18.480
"YOU WERE WONDERFUL,
MR. TEMPLETON."

03:18.573 --> 03:21.031
THEN THE STAGE MANAGER
WILL SEE TO IT

03:21.118 --> 03:23.405
THAT I'M PROPERLY
DELIVERED TO YOU

03:23.495 --> 03:26.738
SO THAT YOU CAN PROPERLY
DELIVER ME BACK HERE

03:26.832 --> 03:28.664
SO THAT I CAN
GO BACK THERE

03:28.750 --> 03:31.333
AND DO IT ALL OVER
AGAIN NEXT NIGHT.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.581
I WON'T SEE,

03:32.671 --> 03:34.127
<i>NOR PARTKZULARLY CARE,</i>

03:34.214 --> 03:36.330
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING
ON OUTSIDE THERE,

03:36.425 --> 03:37.961
OR ANYWHERE
IN THIS HOUSE.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.839
ALL I WANT WILL BE
TO GO TO BED, MARTY.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.425
THAT'S THE BEST PLACE FOR ME.
BED, SLEEP, OBLIVION.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.928
NOVV, SIR, YOU SHOULDN'T
TALK LIKE THAT.

03:47.018 --> 03:51.387
