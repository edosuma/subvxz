30:15.790 --> 30:18.100
How can you that monster
sleep at night?

30:19.980 --> 30:22.260
It's a crazy, maybe not
remember what you did.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.660
Maybe not remember anything.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.020
Lars? Est? S washing clothes
at 2 in the morning?

30:40.200 --> 30:41.750
? I made a lot of noise?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.950
No, I have insomnia.

30:45.090 --> 30:46.700
? Because you have problems
To sleep?

30:47.670 --> 30:48.750
Inner demons.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.300
Ate many "tornadoes"
of meat.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.900
If you do not deten? A,
you had eaten my plate.

30:54.650 --> 30:55.990
Do not you know that pas ??

30:56.500 --> 30:59.850
One of my friends was found
dead, cut into pieces.

31:01.130 --> 31:03.380
I was the? Last to see him
with life.

31:03.850 --> 31:06.740
? Do not imagine who made
something so horrible?

31:07.300 --> 31:11.370
No. But I think I saw something.

31:11.650 --> 31:14.975
I do not remember.
I blocked mind.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.800
I'm sorry for your friend.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.865
But you must stop
torture.

31:21.650 --> 31:22.830

31:23.450 --> 31:27.220

? My grandmother Ingrid sun to say:

31:30.600 --> 31:34.600
Lars, fail,
live and enjoy.

31:38.600 --> 31:39.680
? He said that?

31:41.050 --> 31:42.750
I think I feel
a little better.

32:01.800 --> 32:02.940
"And Papa Bear said ...

32:02.940 --> 32:05.050
Who is? sleeping
in my chair? "

32:06.170 --> 32:07.765
? Your chair?

32:07.800 --> 32:09.085
I, I ...
I did not know.

32:09.180 --> 32:10.480
You're my family.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.315
No, I'm not.

32:12.350 --> 32:13.550
Give us a hint.
? What's your name?

32:14.190 --> 32:15.870
I can not answer that.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.000
? You walk inc? Incognito?

32:18.500 --> 32:19.995
No, of German-Irish origin.

32:21.150 --> 32:21.945
Wait a minute.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.140
Nenita, stand next.

32:24.900 --> 32:25.640
Closer.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.470
Yo Yo, put your head
nearby.

32:28.000 --> 32:28.550
? Closer!

32:29.145 --> 32:30.150
? That's!

32:30.380 --> 32:32.170
? The waitress three heads!

32:32.900 --> 32:33.820
? Bettina Barnes!

32:35.050 --> 32:37.800
No one must know my
true identity.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.890
I escaped? the study.

32:40.540 --> 32:43.800
You can not imagine what it is
be exploited ...

32:43.810 --> 32:47.270
by those meat traders
Fresh power-hungry.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.660
Everyone wants a piece.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.270
? I'm not a pepperoni!

32:52.500 --> 32:55.440
I saw your movie
"Sexual space cats."

32:55.800 --> 32:56.835
A good movie.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.860
I had to make four
sequences.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.330
? Bullshit!

33:01.600 --> 33:04.345
They do not respect the
rights of individuals.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.375
We respect you.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.580
? Truly?

33:10.130 --> 33:11.650
I'm hiding here ...

33:11.655 --> 33:13.940

33:19.300 --> 33:22.620
Yesterday I waited? as two hours.

33:23.430 --> 33:24.770
My name is now Nenita.

33:25.050 --> 33:27.250

33:28.240 --> 33:30.900

33:31.270 --> 33:32.300
Bettina Barnes.

33:32.675 --> 33:33.550

33:34.130 --> 33:37.150
I loved it? "The Queen tarantula
New Jersey, "I swear.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.330
I saw "Sex cats against
killer balls "sixteen times.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.000
? Really?

33:42.300 --> 33:46.750
If Ms. Barnes, you're the best.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.000
You are the incarnation? n female
Nietzsche's Superman ...

33:50.380 --> 33:52.765
Always ready to fight
for the truth ...

33:52.770 --> 33:54.820
in the eternal battle
of the sexes.

33:55.245 --> 33:59.160
It is what I say to my
agent for months.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.250
? What's your name?

34:01.370 --> 34:02.065
Berdine.

34:02.650 --> 34:05.560
From everlasting to
Berdine always.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.550
I need a secretary
trust and compa? era.

34:12.100 --> 34:14.239
? Would you like a job
of summer?

34:15.000 --> 34:18.100
I feel very honored,
but Florence and I have ...

34:18.300 --> 34:19.449
a million? No plans ...

34:20.960 --> 34:24.550
I'm your girl.
? When I start?

34:24.960 --> 34:25.699
Immediately.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.525
Enter. You enter? ...

35:43.670 --> 35:44.200
? Are you okay?

35:45.770 --> 35:49.060
? Because you help me? I Thought
you wanted me drown.

35:50.850 --> 35:52.260
? Because you say something so
absurd?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.040
Everyone knows you hate me.

35:56.750 --> 35:59.480
I do not hate you. Not one bit.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.800
When I saw pens appear? ...

36:04.700 --> 36:05.380
pens? ...

36:07.580 --> 36:09.520
? Do not know to be dipped
before the wave arrives?

36:10.660 --> 36:13.290
Of course I knew.
? It was an accident!

36:14.000 --> 36:16.580
? Never have an accident,
Se? Or Perfect?

36:17.900 --> 36:19.020
? Do not call me as ?!

36:19.900 --> 36:21.520
? What?
? It? Or Perfect?

36:23.050 --> 36:25.370
You do not know how terrible is that
think you're a god.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.230
Intelligent, atl? Tico.
You can not imagine the pressure? N.

36:30.650 --> 36:33.100
I thought people passing
India hunger sat badly.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.220
? It's a curse? No!

36:34.800 --> 36:38.700
You're so busy trying to be
man who does not understand my pain.

36:38.870 --> 36:40.720
You're not a kid,
? And never will be? S!

36:41.180 --> 36:44.400
? Because you can not be a
Marvel Ann normal girl like?

36:45.650 --> 36:48.100
I wish I could be like her.

36:48.630 --> 36:50.490
So educated, so refined ...

36:51.200 --> 36:54.270
And I imagine the evenings
wonderful they spent together.

36:54.580 --> 36:57.740
Going to? Pear, museums,
reading important books.

36:59.560 --> 37:00.420
? Forget it!

37:00.900 --> 37:03.460
If you drown again ...
s? lvate yourself.

37:05.075 --> 37:07.860
No matter how hard you try,
• Always be? S Mr. Perfect!

37:08.515 --> 37:09.950
? Perfect, perfect, perfect!

37:10.345 --> 37:12.860
? Perfect hair, perfect teeth,
perfect eyes!

37:14.330 --> 37:15.705
? Perfectly perfect!

37:18.800 --> 37:21.760
Ms. Barnes.
? Miss Barnes!

37:22.570 --> 37:24.900
Another miserable and horrifying
sci-fi movie.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
I can not identify with
"The Martian Rat Face".

37:30.100 --> 37:31.415
? It's that bad?

37:31.900 --> 37:35.500
Honey, could Lassie
write a better script.

37:36.580 --> 37:40.470
I found this photograph out there.
? Is your fam? Lia?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.730
No, I've never seen.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.640
Come in, come.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.350
I brought these flowers ...

37:50.190 --> 37:52.550
..but the marchit? with the
my body heat.

37:53.550 --> 37:55.650
You must have a hot body.

37:56.530 --> 37:58.500
Berdine Hello, how do you going?

37:59.600 --> 38:03.600
Berdine found this photo.
? About being? N?

38:05.155 --> 38:06.900
They are those who lived here.

38:07.140 --> 38:08.465
The Elkins family.

38:08.700 --> 38:09.800
? There are those who ...

38:10.800 --> 38:11.960
Tell me.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.050
I like stories
thriller.

38:14.300 --> 38:17.380
That story I
freezes the soul.

38:18.230 --> 38:22.400
The last 15 years the fam? Lia
Elkins came to live here.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.330
Larry, of 10 years, was the
more small or all three.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.320
When I could not sleep,
on a summer night,

38:27.600 --> 38:30.480
I took a knife from the kitchen
and the sea? to everyone.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.340
How terrible.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.800
They say the house
est? haunted.

38:38.260 --> 38:39.040
If you are afraid ...

38:39.350 --> 38:42.730
we could be your
bodyguard, if you like.

38:43.050 --> 38:44.165
That gentle.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.930
? Ms. B., I have a better idea!

38:47.150 --> 38:49.900
I have a book of rituals
Bali exorcisms.

38:50.140 --> 38:52.050
I bet rid us
of these ghosts.

38:52.750 --> 38:53.825
? Be? funny!

38:54.099 --> 38:55.000
Hag? MoSlo.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.810
If hag? MoSlo ...

38:56.965 --> 39:01.140
Tonight we'll take
those spirits

39:01.800 --> 39:04.250
We will give a lesson? N.

39:06.700 --> 39:09.800
? An exorcism?
? With a movie star?

39:12.300 --> 39:15.160
Perhaps with Deborah Kerr
or Audrey Hepburn.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.180
? With Bettina Barnes?
? I think not!

39:17.800 --> 39:21.350
It's not like when I drive
the car park.

39:21.351 --> 39:23.430
Florence, put the eggs
in the fridge.

39:24.850 --> 39:27.050
This pudding Bavarian
love you ?.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.050
Mother ...

39:30.800 --> 39:34.320
These meetings encourage
the sexual act.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.220
It's not like in the movies.

39:37.815 --> 39:40.440
A man and a woman
hugging,

39:40.441 --> 39:43.441
lighting? n soft,
an image of Manhattan,

39:44.065 --> 39:45.990
Rachmaninov playing
background.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.430
? The reality is different!

39:50.000 --> 39:51.060
You can not imagine ...

39:51.120 --> 39:53.700
how disgusting is a
sticky member ...

39:53.900 --> 39:54.720
machacandote.

39:55.480 --> 39:55.990
? You like it?

39:56.200 --> 39:56.900
? How are you?

39:56.910 --> 39:57.985
? Stop, you do give me year!

39:58.920 --> 40:00.830
? Imagine this but down there!

40:07.800 --> 40:09.700
? Take your dirty hands, bitch!

40:09.760 --> 40:10.300
? Florence!

40:10.500 --> 40:13.590
Do not tell me how to prepare
the macaroon.

40:13.600 --> 40:16.950
While boiling, mass
It must be hard and ready.

40:17.100 --> 40:17.660
? Flowers, stop!

40:23.300 --> 40:23.765
Mother ...

40:24.800 --> 40:26.500
? What it happens?
? Why are you crying?

40:29.860 --> 40:31.240
I do not know right?

40:34.700 --> 40:37.350
I am the worst mother in the world.

40:38.465 --> 40:39.445
it is just that ...

40:40.600 --> 40:42.880
things are different
to when you were young ...

40:43.600 --> 40:45.100
but no worse.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.300
You wanna go to that party?

40:49.190 --> 40:51.850
I'm dying to go.
All room? N all ?.

40:54.454 --> 40:56.470
Until there guys ...

40:57.480 --> 41:00.840
as they say now,
"OK no problem".

41:01.200 --> 41:01.930
? Mother!

41:04.300 --> 41:07.030
I feel the spies ritus ...

41:07.360 --> 41:09.720
breathing down my neck.

41:11.400 --> 41:15.210
His lips on mine.
Very soft.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.355
A caress ...

41:19.100 --> 41:22.480
Fingers touching my breasts.

41:25.330 --> 41:26.300
A tongue ...

41:27.400 --> 41:30.250
A tongue licking mine ...

41:30.260 --> 41:32.090
? Forgot? the spell!

41:32.680 --> 41:34.150
That should come first.

41:35.700 --> 41:37.740
We were going very well.

41:39.100 --> 41:43.950
Let us pause.
Har? My specialty:

41:44.100 --> 41:47.130
my famous pancake
allspice and paprika.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.810
? What a mess!

41:53.870 --> 41:54.870
I see it.

41:55.570 --> 41:56.530
Oh, stop!

41:59.015 --> 42:04.030
Better to keep my image
cleans away the spirits.

42:07.900 --> 42:08.500
? Wait!

42:09.550 --> 42:11.520
Meet me in the bathroom? Or
in 10 minutes.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.000
? Look at this!

42:15.050 --> 42:16.730
It must be Bettina's room.

42:20.100 --> 42:21.550
I am, Starcat.

42:22.070 --> 42:22.650
Sorry.

42:23.500 --> 42:27.900
I think Larry Elkins is? good
confined at some? n madhouse.

42:28.240 --> 42:32.500
Unless the authorities
is determined that? cured.

42:32.700 --> 42:33.780
If so, go free.

42:34.300 --> 42:36.480
As an expert, perhaps
you can help me.

42:37.100 --> 42:37.580
You Will See ...

42:38.160 --> 42:41.000
I have a friend
it worries me.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.995
It has blackouts.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.240
What kind of loopholes?

42:45.800 --> 42:46.210
Well ...

42:47.300 --> 42:51.000
He says that when he returns itself
remembers nothing but ...

42:51.680 --> 42:54.760
believes that in this period
It is crazy.

42:57.050 --> 42:57.445
Well ...

42:58.300 --> 42:58.960
? What do you think?

42:59.600 --> 43:02.000
I have no information to
an accurate diagnosis but ...

43:02.020 --> 43:06.400
I suffered episodes
of schizophrenic psychosis.

43:08.150 --> 43:10.170
I did not know Berdine
it was so unstable.

43:10.620 --> 43:11.260
? Berdine?

43:12.160 --> 43:13.500
Who speaks of Berdine?

43:13.600 --> 43:14.660
You have no friend.

43:15.350 --> 43:16.950
So I am a
lonely girl.

43:17.400 --> 43:18.950
Sorry, I did not mean that.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.145
? How about a truce?

43:25.140 --> 43:26.590
OK, a truce.

43:27.700 --> 43:29.220
I recall what I said,
you were perfect.

43:29.700 --> 43:30.995
These flawed.

43:31.500 --> 43:34.780
I even see a grain
the tip of your nose.

43:34.781 --> 43:36.370
? A hug from friends?

43:41.300 --> 43:44.500
I think I like you because
you are wide.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
I can not help it.

43:46.470 --> 43:49.380
Not everyone sees the dark side
of the life.

43:57.260 --> 43:58.240
Fuck.

43:59.250 --> 43:59.990
? Starcat!

44:00.600 --> 44:01.290
Here I am.

44:02.400 --> 44:03.125
? You remember me?

44:04.300 --> 44:05.050
Marvel Ann.

44:17.700 --> 44:20.220
? Is the girl of my dreams?

44:26.600 --> 44:27.330
Itching.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.840
Bettina Imagine using this.

44:40.100 --> 44:41.400
And naked underneath.

44:44.500 --> 44:47.600
I imagine moving
inside this.

44:48.550 --> 44:49.150
Let me see.

44:50.900 --> 44:52.670
Let's see how it is.

45:00.400 --> 45:01.860
Test yourself this.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.400
It is your household size.

45:10.600 --> 45:11.140
I dont know ...

45:12.330 --> 45:14.120
It makes me look too fat.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.580
We were looking for something to
exorcism.

45:19.700 --> 45:20.850
We do not spoil anything.

45:20.860 --> 45:22.450
Of course.

45:23.770 --> 45:27.380
These white feathers are
well with your tan.

45:28.900 --> 45:32.050
I do not think it is
the appropriate color.

45:32.400 --> 45:35.640
Try the black,
a Parisian model.

45:36.050 --> 45:38.320
Hey, I do not think ...
truly ...

45:38.550 --> 45:40.860
There is nothing wrong with
dressing well.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.665
That's why I'm an actress.

45:43.905 --> 45:48.100
We should go to the salon
Beauty afternoon.

45:48.250 --> 45:50.490
Clear. We lose,
you know ...

45:50.500 --> 45:52.145
The others are waiting for us ...

45:52.450 --> 45:53.735
Yes, yes, the other ...

45:55.150 --> 45:57.380
? But they have not even seen
my shoes!

46:00.900 --> 46:04.400
Berdine,? I have been strange to
lately?

46:04.700 --> 46:07.060
? Besides being a snob
nosy?

46:07.400 --> 46:08.835
I misbehaved.

46:09.050 --> 46:12.000
It's okay. Now these
with the beautiful people.

46:12.765 --> 46:15.530
Be a best friend
this misplaced.

46:15.700 --> 46:17.940
As Sartre would say ...

46:17.051 --> 46:18.051
What I want to know ...

46:18.835 --> 46:23.000
? I think episodes
psychotic schizophrenic?

46:23.730 --> 46:25.400
? Schizophrenic?

46:25.800 --> 46:27.370
? Where do you get that from?

46:27.600 --> 46:32.540
Starcat told me,
before we talk.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.370
? This often happens?

46:37.400 --> 46:40.160
The last time was when
Junior was killed.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.250
? It's not funny!

46:45.400 --> 46:46.990
Do not be so serious,
it was a joke.

46:52.000 --> 46:52.800
? He is dead?

46:54.000 --> 46:54.750
Well dead.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.800
- T.J.!
- Do not touch anything.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.100
Cookie, what do you have in your mouth?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.970
? OMG!

47:13.578 --> 47:16.660
This killing my friends,
I do not want to die ..

47:17.000 --> 47:19.600
This experience, this
sense of loss.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.500
Those deaths ...

47:21.501 --> 47:22.110
? It's too much!

47:22.670 --> 47:24.800
? This is your answer
the crimes?

47:25.000 --> 47:26.770
? Wait until we are
all dead?

47:27.200 --> 47:29.050
We heard nothing.
Only the cry.

47:29.170 --> 47:31.100
That cry sono
with feeling.

47:31.485 --> 47:35.180
Sweetie, passion ...
Something burning inside.

47:38.800 --> 47:42.210
Ms. Barnes, I hope my
colleagues do not bother him.

47:43.040 --> 47:43.800
No.

47:44.750 --> 47:45.840
I'm fine.

47:46.700 --> 47:49.430
This drama just makes me
a better artist.

47:50.500 --> 47:55.290
Within weeks, this drama
It will be an experience ...

47:55.291 --> 47:58.870
tr? logic, and all this
It transformed me ...

47:59.300 --> 48:01.500
... Part of all this.

48:02.800 --> 48:03.600
? Est? listening?

48:08.160 --> 48:09.140
Keep it up.

48:10.000 --> 48:10.900
Keep the rhythm.

48:12.100 --> 48:12.660
? Stronger!

48:13.900 --> 48:14.620
? Now I just!

48:15.750 --> 48:17.020
? I see the light!

48:20.300 --> 48:20.930
? What it happens?

48:23.770 --> 48:24.480
I catch my breath.

48:27.300 --> 48:28.800
Talk to the sergeant.

48:29.300 --> 48:32.650
I told him about marriage
and floral arrangements.

48:33.300 --> 48:34.000
have you been busy.

48:34.270 --> 48:35.750
Well, I want to marry.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.520
? It is not very soon?

48:38.470 --> 48:40.890
? Why? ? Did not
we are ready?

48:41.430 --> 48:44.400
Well, next month volume
the test for detective.

48:45.850 --> 48:48.000
• Do not plan on having children?

48:48.450 --> 48:49.270
? Children?

48:49.800 --> 48:50.830
? You do not joke!

48:51.200 --> 48:52.600
My career has just begun.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.520
Surely you can understand.

48:57.550 --> 48:58.230
I suppose,

48:59.200 --> 49:00.970
we're just cops on foot.

49:01.600 --> 49:02.540
I want more.

49:03.800 --> 49:06.625
A bastards show them?
a woman can be a detective.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.230
? And where I stay?

49:10.350 --> 49:12.530
Dear ...
you stay with me.

49:12.540 --> 49:12.950
? No!

49:14.200 --> 49:15.150
I'm not your fucking.

49:15.170 --> 49:16.040
? Do not talk like that!

49:16.150 --> 49:17.150
I do not want this.

49:19.200 --> 49:19.940
None of this.

49:19.800 --> 49:20.175
Kanaka.

49:21.155 --> 49:23.840
Dear, success
it does not mean anything ...

49:23.900 --> 49:24.980
if you are not with me.

49:26.550 --> 49:27.930
? I need you!

49:30.900 --> 49:31.350
? Monica!

49:31.900 --> 49:33.930
-? Are you okay?
- Of course.

49:35.370 --> 49:38.700
It is rare that the victim had
only one testicle in the mouth.

49:39.585 --> 49:41.185
They usually come in pairs.

49:41.500 --> 49:44.080
Because only had one.
Verification.

49:44.650 --> 49:46.950
A sausage, a single potato.

49:47.650 --> 49:48.180
Cookie ...

49:49.120 --> 49:51.090
the girl who was killed
at the drive ...

49:51.460 --> 49:54.230
? Had a scar?

49:54.650 --> 49:55.940
Yes, not ?.

49:56.900 --> 49:58.650
He had harelip.

49:58.700 --> 50:03.100
Clear. A birth defect.

50:03.300 --> 50:06.000
The surfer had psoriasis.

50:06.430 --> 50:08.150
And this guy only had
one testicle.

50:09.600 --> 50:10.040
Cookie ...

50:11.430 --> 50:14.950
someone has problems
different people.

50:17.500 --> 50:21.030
Look at this toy knife.
No short or a sandwich.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.250
If there's something I can not stand,
It is the imperfection.

50:25.700 --> 50:27.150
No place in the world
for that.

50:29.900 --> 50:31.500
It's not the same without
T.J. or Junior.

50:31.900 --> 50:36.200
I still remember the image of T. J.
tanning on the beach.

50:37.500 --> 50:39.200
And to think I had
only one testicle ...

50:40.500 --> 50:41.680
You never know people.

50:42.900 --> 50:43.375
Yes.

50:46.100 --> 50:50.870
Kanaka,? We cancel the party,
as respect for the dead?

50:51.000 --> 50:54.100
No way, we should celebrate
full moon ...

50:54.101 --> 50:56.700
to greet God,
King Neptune.

50:56.750 --> 50:58.430
Yes, we have fun.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.860
? We? He said it again.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.030
Let the girl to come together
men, maybe it ...

51:04.031 --> 51:06.200
good mixing,
such as coca-cola with rum.

51:07.400 --> 51:09.160
Will it be fabulous!

51:09.590 --> 51:12.540
I've never been to an orgy.
? I wear?

51:36.850 --> 51:38.340
I must go, Marvel Ann
I am waiting for me.

51:38.450 --> 51:41.700
I promised a gift
not to forget.

51:43.070 --> 51:43.670
Clear.

51:46.400 --> 51:50.750
Dr. Edwards served before us
people drink.

51:50.900 --> 51:53.170
So we planted the evidence
of blood. My mother hated.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.310
But in this case,
I feel lost.

51:56.900 --> 52:00.560
You are a specialist in treating
homicidal maniacs.

52:00.800 --> 52:04.370
Yes, but I have never participated
in a criminal investigation.

52:05.000 --> 52:05.900
do not worry ...

52:06.175 --> 52:08.130
I take care of
police work.

52:08.700 --> 52:09.850
I would like to know

52:10.100 --> 52:12.200
What kind of sick
We are looking for?

52:12.500 --> 52:13.700
The psychologist? Ticos ...

52:13.900 --> 52:15.135
become vulnerable ...

52:15.300 --> 52:18.600
... And unhappy and are considered
pose? two somehow.

52:18.980 --> 52:19.970
Give me a profile.

52:20.250 --> 52:21.590
In my opinion ...

52:21.800 --> 52:25.190
It has an intelligence
more child well.

52:25.210 --> 52:27.260
Vulnerable, but sweet.

52:27.900 --> 52:32.370
Able to express tenderness
and extreme brutality.

52:33.255 --> 52:36.000
The murderer is very
intelligent ...

52:36.400 --> 52:39.350
but curiously, lost
contact with reality.

52:40.140 --> 52:43.250
A curious mixture of
sexuality and innocence.

52:43.800 --> 52:44.990
This Single? Duo ...

52:45.400 --> 52:48.810
He wants desperately
normal.

52:49.200 --> 52:52.790
Extremely complicating
your research.

52:53.000 --> 52:53.950
? Why?

52:54.100 --> 52:58.120
Because spare no? efforts
just to look normal.

52:58.690 --> 53:00.650
He or she could be
any.

53:02.300 --> 53:03.120
? What are you doing?

53:04.380 --> 53:06.830
A pagan god of sex,
Lual for the party.

53:08.485 --> 53:11.520
What a coincidence. I need
any advice on that.

53:12.600 --> 53:13.150
You Will See ...

53:14.350 --> 53:17.000
a friend of mine
Do you have a friend.

53:17.650 --> 53:19.500
But she wants to be
something more than friends.

53:21.350 --> 53:22.450
I should know ...

53:23.050 --> 53:24.670
? You owe it mean?

53:25.700 --> 53:26.870
? The respect ??

53:28.100 --> 53:31.380
First lesson n?:
No offer.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.510
Nobody likes it
something so f? cyl.

53:34.250 --> 53:37.890
Like me, I have a friend
I have not seen in a while.

53:39.050 --> 53:40.450
The strange as.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.550
Even s? as
I tell him.

53:43.600 --> 53:46.100
? The name Ann Bowman
She tells you something?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.230
No. Do you live around here?

53:51.120 --> 53:52.000
Very close.

53:53.590 --> 53:56.980
What he likes
It is a mystery to me.

53:58.530 --> 53:59.600
? Your back hurts?

54:00.500 --> 54:02.345
I'm losing control.

54:02.700 --> 54:05.250
Get out before committing
crazy.

54:05.300 --> 54:09.650
Yes. Mama dies if you know
I'm here alone with a man.

54:10.090 --> 54:11.220
I do not know why ...

54:11.350 --> 54:13.370
if I am not even remotely
sensual.

54:13.700 --> 54:14.540
I mean ...

54:20.300 --> 54:21.820
? Ann? ? You came back?

54:22.100 --> 54:24.030
Finally ...

54:24.035 --> 54:26.250
that idiot not me
She left back.

54:26.600 --> 54:27.700
They are circles? If?

54:27.900 --> 54:29.245
All right, Einstein.

54:29.500 --> 54:32.500
Señora, I've been a kid or bad.

54:33.400 --> 54:37.600
At the kids are bad
whips, are punished.

54:38.700 --> 54:39.490
? Great!

54:40.500 --> 54:42.150
What are you doing dressed like a bitch?

54:42.250 --> 54:43.060
? You are crazy?

54:43.600 --> 54:44.600
? Ann?
? Ann?

54:45.000 --> 54:48.700
? Ann? My name Tylene.
Tylene Carmichael Carmel.

54:49.050 --> 54:53.250
I am cashier. Until 16:30,
then my boss ...

54:53.500 --> 54:56.060
I want back to Ann.
Look what I have for you.

54:56.300 --> 54:58.630
It away. I have a
knife? I cut ?!

54:58.650 --> 54:59.700
Quiet, bad idea.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.400
Fuck me boy.

55:01.500 --> 55:04.090
Or try to escape.

55:04.580 --> 55:06.800
The world wants
rid of me ...

55:06.810 --> 55:10.220
but I reappear as the Fenix
to reclaim the mine.

55:10.800 --> 55:15.160
Ann Bowman, dominating,
Empress of planet Earth.

55:16.030 --> 55:16.720
Touching huh?

55:17.800 --> 55:19.310
I'm going to lose my head.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.475
Miss B., Here
home delivery.

55:24.700 --> 55:27.460
Berdine, can not express
universal emotions ...

55:27.470 --> 55:29.800
if I do not see as
normal people live.

55:32.370 --> 55:34.420
They are they terribly human!

55:41.500 --> 55:44.630
Do not call attention.
we are here ...

55:44.870 --> 55:45.720
to observe.

55:48.050 --> 55:48.880
Look.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.275
? That courage!

55:51.300 --> 55:53.475
Yes, it's very brave.

55:54.050 --> 55:56.330
- Hello Berdine.
- Hi Rhonda.

55:56.495 --> 55:59.690
Finally do not walk alone.
? I will show it to your friends?

56:00.160 --> 56:02.250
They are Yo Yo and Provoloney.

56:02.600 --> 56:04.370
Intellectuals.

56:04.500 --> 56:05.900
She is my cousin ...

56:06.100 --> 56:08.100
Frida Dieffendorfer of Altuna.

56:08.580 --> 56:09.825
You're not Altuna.

56:10.355 --> 56:11.560
You Bettina Barnes.

56:12.530 --> 56:14.300
You're very kind.

56:14.550 --> 56:16.030
And very pretty.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.590
So this is your
true voice.

56:18.425 --> 56:20.480
It does not sound forced to
seem funny.

56:21.840 --> 56:24.710
- You Want to join us?
- No, I must go home.

56:24.900 --> 56:26.250
Friends come to dinner.

56:26.700 --> 56:27.930
Berdine not est? S guest.

56:28.370 --> 56:30.530
Ms. Barnes, I am a
fan of yours.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.750
For his upcoming films,
You must use best c? maras.

56:34.350 --> 56:36.160
So could? cover
those wrinkles.

56:37.200 --> 56:37.850
Well ...

56:38.130 --> 56:39.930
It has been a pleasure.
Kisses.

56:42.580 --> 56:44.900
That wheelchair needs
an ejection seat.

56:47.060 --> 56:49.920
Give us a few more minutes.

56:50.840 --> 56:51.480
Dear ...

56:52.500 --> 56:54.890
? You have said that you
very similar ...

56:54.900 --> 56:57.820
the girl who makes those
terrible horror movies?

56:59.170 --> 57:00.340
I need air.

57:01.600 --> 57:04.750
? Oxygen, I suffocate!
I must return ...

57:04.800 --> 57:05.640
You accompany or.

57:05.660 --> 57:06.600
? No!

57:07.200 --> 57:08.090
I must go alone.

57:08.700 --> 57:09.740
Do not worry.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.750
For me, a burger
fries and coke.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.070
? You look stupid?

57:25.130 --> 57:25.812
? What are you doing?

57:26.780 --> 57:28.870
? I do not need your help! ? OK?

57:29.770 --> 57:31.330
? Where the hell are you taking me?

57:34.800 --> 57:36.540
Here, in at? N.

57:38.600 --> 57:40.090
Bacon.

57:40.940 --> 57:42.310
Your plums.

57:42.850 --> 57:44.500
? All right?

57:45.030 --> 57:46.200
? Your friend is coming back?

57:46.700 --> 57:47.600
I hope so.

57:49.100 --> 57:50.350
? OMG!

57:50.400 --> 57:51.600
? Berdine, dear!

57:53.090 --> 57:54.100
How long ...

57:54.600 --> 57:55.260
? Nenita?

57:55.500 --> 57:56.950
? Where did you find that?

57:57.700 --> 57:58.240
? This?

57:59.200 --> 58:01.060
it's a gift.
An admirer.

58:01.400 --> 58:03.640
I'm dying for a cocktail.

58:03.760 --> 58:05.300
Double, baby.
Without the olive.

58:05.900 --> 58:07.970
You have no smoking age.

58:09.640 --> 58:10.860
Please retire.

58:11.350 --> 58:12.180
It bothers me.

58:13.200 --> 58:14.800
These very bold.

58:14.900 --> 58:17.680
I like your makeup.
It's like Cleopatra.

58:18.800 --> 58:19.500
I ...

58:23.600 --> 58:25.200
? They have my fingers?

58:26.700 --> 58:27.500
? What is this?

58:27.550 --> 58:29.200
it's fabulous.

58:29.250 --> 58:30.020
? Are you okay?

58:30.500 --> 58:31.135
Berdine ...

58:31.550 --> 58:32.500
It's happening again.

58:32.570 --> 58:33.265
? What happens?

58:33.950 --> 58:35.030
I was in the cabin? a Kanaka.

58:37.400 --> 58:38.950
God? Happens to me?

58:39.400 --> 58:41.100
? You have nothing bad!

58:42.000 --> 58:43.820
You're kidding.

58:44.200 --> 58:47.480
Always makes these
Extra voices? ace.

58:55.900 --> 58:56.850
? Make space!

58:57.200 --> 58:57.820
? Police!

58:58.050 --> 59:00.490
? All of you!
? Disappear!

59:02.750 --> 59:03.500
A girl inv? Outlet.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.520
Follow the pattern.

59:07.650 --> 59:08.500
Ms. Barnes ...

59:09.200 --> 59:12.000
Because I feel a deja vu?

59:12.650 --> 59:16.220
I have a pair of handcuffs on
my purse? s why?

59:17.500 --> 59:18.800
What a coincidence ...

59:18.801 --> 59:22.800
When you show emerges
another scene.

59:23.800 --> 59:24.750
Listen ...

59:25.100 --> 59:26.030
? I is accusing?

59:28.790 --> 59:30.730
Guys, sit, please.

59:33.900 --> 59:37.450
I want to talk about
the murders.

59:38.600 --> 59:41.800
One of you could be
the next victim.

59:43.100 --> 59:44.880
-? Because we?
- Until now ...

59:45.200 --> 59:47.500
We have a girl
cleft lip,

59:47.600 --> 59:48.760
An invalid in
Wheelchair,

59:49.000 --> 59:50.250
a boy with psoriasis,

59:50.600 --> 59:51.810
and another with a single
testicle.

59:52.500 --> 59:57.130
Do they have something the murderer
You might consider ... defective?

59:58.550 --> 59:59.655
Come on, confess.

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:02.330
Everyone has something to hide.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.350
As they say nothing,
I dir you ?.

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:07.400
Provoloney is? so constipated ...

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:12.200
it needs 67 days to
go ba? o.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.200
? Want to see something funny?

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.670
Starcat, show the big toe.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.470
Is incarnated? u? a,
They want to vomit.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.490
? You think this is funny?

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.700
Wheelchair,
cleft lips ...

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.200
? How you want
We not laugh at us ?.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.300
Guys.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:29.700
I hope someday people
that is not black humor white.

01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:32.810
Yo Yo,? Nothing to say?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.150
There's nothing wrong with me.

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:36.760
it's for your own good.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.200
? You do not sit down ...

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.150
"Different"
somehow?

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:44.015
Maybe a little.

01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:46.150
? What are you talking about?
You are 100% natural.

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:48.160
But if ...

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.110
sometimes I feel like ...

01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:52.500
something inside me ...

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:53.600
it is like ...

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.350
I feel for the ...

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.060
I mean ...

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.350
Provoloney and ...

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:02.300
? I can not believe it! ? Marica!
Hopefully the murderer kills.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.760
? Provoloney!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.580
How was my voice?

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:10.560
As an old 30 years.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.060
"Berdine, dear"

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:15.380
Do not dir? S anyone
I'm crazy? if?

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:16.700
? Of course not!

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:20.900
Florence Nenita,
you're my best friend.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.060
Save? your secret
forever.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.030
-? Would you do that for me?
- Daria my life.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.565
It makes me feel like before ...

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.985
when we were alone
two of us.

01:01:34.986 --> 01:01:37.770
Florence,? Can you
ask a favor?

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.420
I want to use these pants
Saturday night.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.700
But lacks the button.
I'm not good with needles.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.590
Every time I try
I feel like a fool.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.600
- Of course, Lars.
- Thank You.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.500
? The Lual! I die
for I know everything.

01:01:58.550 --> 01:01:59.630
I will not go.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:05.000
? You have to go! You worked all
the summer to invite you.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.300
What if there comes another loophole
and I throw it all away?

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.110
Who appears when
I come lagoon?

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.480
Will it be I the mat? to everyone?

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.870
Could not? back to school.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.170
You must finish the race.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.940
It is terrible to see how
wasting the head ...

01:02:24.945 --> 01:02:26.880
that has so much potential
to earn money.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.720
So parents speak.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.380
Kanaka says I can
be a great surfer.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:33.760
? Where are you going?

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.120
I'm planning my future,
and you do not est? s on him.

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:40.870
And here are your pants
boxing.

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.650
I'll help with that.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:42.900
? Do not touch me!

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:43.760
Here it is released.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.600
Marvel Ann, I'm sorry.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.000
You did it on purpose.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.360
You're a selfish, crazy,
disgusting and perverted.

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:58.650
I suggest you take
the correct road ...

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.000
and you behave like a
decent Presbyterian.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.600
Problem with a girl?

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.910
It is more than that.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.640
I am a very complex being,
deeply anxious and nervous.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.290
? Because I say this?
You're just a ni? a.

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:26.240
I'm not a ni? A, I am ...

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:29.350
How would Kanaka,
"Lewd and voluptuous".

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.350
He does not say that, liar.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.050
Teach me or surfing,
and always she wants to be with me.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:39.800
We actually had in his Caba? A
one t you? -? - t you intimate?.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.600
You say to make me jealous.

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.150
If the USSR declared war,
not let you stay in my refuge.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.100
? We were not in a truce?

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.400
You need not be so bad.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:59.430
Starcat ...

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.250
What were you doing with Marvel Ann?

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:05.790
When they were alone.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.620
I do verg? Embarrassment.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.525
Tell me, I must learn
those things.

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.300
He huddled close to me.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.280
? So?

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.880
Yes, well.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.980
And put my arm around another.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.780
? So? ? What else?

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.920
He kissed her neck from behind.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:38.895
you know ...

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.100
in the movies, sit
together on the rocks, for example.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.640
? I can not do it with you!

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.950
? Come on, think
Marvel'm Ann!

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.250
I do not want to think
I'm frigid.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.850
I stroked her arm
and she kissed my chest.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.970
? It drew clothes?

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.580
He stroked her soft skin.
The sun shone.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.260
She touched my muscles
with the tip of his fingers.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.570
He knelt as if
in a trance.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.730
My erect penis touched her face.
He puts it on his cheek,

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.850
a hand grabbed my balls
and he touched my anus with another finger.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.160
? God!

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.750
? Nenita, come back!

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:40.520
Kanaka.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.270
I do not like
surprises visitors.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.810
I wanted to get there first
that Nenita.

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.550
? Why?
It's not your girl.

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.550
Nor should be yours.
It's just a ni? a.

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.370
That's what you think.

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:54.465
- If you put a finger ...
- Quiet, I have not touched.

01:05:54.466 --> 01:05:55.350
But I must tell you ...

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.930
It is phenomenal.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.700
There is something in it
you can not imagine.

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:03.070
It's like two girls in one.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.140
? What are you talking about?

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:08.090
It's odd, but they are like
twin in one body.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.150
? You say you have double
personality?

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.400
One is an angel. The other is
a demon named Ann Bowman.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.900
And it becomes
blink of an eye.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.350
? You think this Ann Bowman
It could be violent?

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:25.530
Tell me.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.080
Hope you
you have disinfected.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:37.470
I hate to say, but this girl
could be the murderer of Malibu.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:39.870
Hi ..

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:41.640
Hello.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.700
We talked about you.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.670
? Are you following me?
You look like the CIA.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.950
Nenita ...

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.500
Redecor? the place.

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:54.230
? How about my curtain?
Full of c? Circles.

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:58.950
Is that you become crazy
With Circles.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.150
Starcat ...

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.830
This is the friend
I want to introduce.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.160
? Scoundrel!

01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:11.065
- Look what you did.
- I did nothing.

01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:12.650
? What happened?

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.540
? God!

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.350
? Who are you?

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:17.090
Mama, what do you do here?

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.000
Your concert was
at 4,? you forget?

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:24.720
Buscandote mix me
the worst of the beach.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:26.040
? And here I find you!

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:26.920
? In this situation!

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.740
- Mrs. Forrest, do not understand.
- I understand very well.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.070
This is what young
They call an orgy.

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:36.160
Mama, Kanaka and Starcat are
my friends.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.530
- Florence, wait in the car.
- But mom ...

01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:41.370
I do not argue.
? Go to the car!

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.190
They know that to present? charges.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.500
You'll need a good lawyer.

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:52.470
? Because they break? the neck
in court!

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.630
Captain.

01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:58.570
If, Cookie.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.570

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:07.410
I did not know that gathered

Lars is kind ...

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.640

01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:18.490
It turns on and off,
Makes me crazy.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:19.779

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:23.000

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.229

The bank moves.
You help ?.

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.270
I think he needs
an electrician.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.470
Maybe you should put that
bulb in the socket.

01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:02.320
Ms. Forrest never
I had seen so.

01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:06.540
This is not you.
No, not you.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.850
? As you climb up here?

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.730

Climbing for beginners "

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.200

This vessel.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:35.870
Bettina ...

01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:37.800
Have you seen the Nenita?

01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:40.500
True, I have not seen.

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.490
Starcat, I want you to know
my new friend, Joey.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.020
He is deaf.

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:51.030
And he has 11 fingers.

Calm down, Provoloney.
You're out of control.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.200
I can not stand the pressure? N.

01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:28.680
I'm not constipated.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.070
- I must go.
- Do what you have to do.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.890

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.120
Nenita.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:03.835
You look so ...

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.310
? Glamorous?

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:07.315
? Sophisticated?

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:09.900
? Stunning?

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:12.600
No how to say this ...

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.840
- But you should not be here.
- Oh, I get the message.

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:17.799
? Truly?

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.880
As Marvel Ann is? here,
I am nothing for t ?.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.260
Listen to me:

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.850
I will be the soul of this Lual.

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.645
And if they stop me ...

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.150
? I'll kill you!

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.370
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:48.000
Kanaka, Who is that?

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.500
? Do you know him?

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.300
Unfortunately yes.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.860
When Riley leaves the house
the bodies appear.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.200
I wonder if there
any relationship.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:14:59.850
It is causing you.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.855
It causes me some time.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:06.980
Wedge Riley.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.000
? What brings you to our
small a celebration?

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:14.240
It is a friendly visit,
no to face.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.410
I like the views, but
no way to trash like you.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.100
Calma daddy.

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.800
This is not your territory.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.700
Let me give you some advice ...

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:28.070
to honor Neptune
You must sacrifice a virgin.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
? To sacrifice a virgin?
? What are you talking about?

01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:33.000
A ritual that began?
Del Mar 52.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.120
? Forget Wedge!

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:37.240
? What about the sacrifice
of a virgin? I say ...

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.670
? What are you talking about?

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.150
You should not be here.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.100
? You treat me like a
puppy again!

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.970
We would do the ritual, but
we have no virgin.

01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:49.570
Well, I offer.
I'm your man.

01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:51.155
I mean, his virgin.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.250
Fresh-fresh
refrigerator.

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.540
Har what? S good.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.220
Do not allow ?.

01:16:00.450 --> 01:16:03.770
Do not.
It is a fate worse than death.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.705
You're going to let your friends
spoil a memorable night?

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.620
? Let the ritual begin!

01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:13.970
But I have some
conditions.

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.930
No blindfold ...

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:20.950
What's going on back there?

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.750
? Is Nenita?

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.950
This more decorated than
a country buffet.

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:32.050
At least he has clothes on.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.930
But in Altuna.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:40.160
King Neptune, we offer you
Ring faith.

01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:42.970
In other words,
? Form a circle!

01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:47.286
? Nothing c? Circles?
So it is not done.

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:56.030
? Bailen, silly!

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.400
? Bailen!

01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.410
? So do not act a virgin!

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.780
? Kiss my ass idiot!

01:17:01.170 --> 01:17:04.330
? I command here! Put me down
this crap. ? Now!

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.800

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.920
Who has my damn l? Tigo?

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.000
She har? some
imitations.

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.360
Click the "Zsa Zsa".

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.220
? I told them not to touch me!

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.840
It's just a girl.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.030
I'm not a girl.
I am a Goddess.

01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:24.490
And the first thing to be sacrificed?
be? n your balls, boy.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.440
Official, these men
They seduced my daughter.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.270
His daughter is? ill.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.250

01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:35.670
? There is? sick!

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.700
? It is true!

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.530
I'm not a lunatic who
they say I am.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.900
I am in control of the situation.

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.370
You're just an illusion that
Nenita think the ...

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.730
to express their
rage and anger.

01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:48.270
They are a beautiful sentences ...

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.000
in a nice package.

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.000
I'm going to hypnotize ...

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:53.860

Do not allow? this.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.880
And he made a lobotomy to
cold blood. Starcat ...

You can not keep
eyes open ...

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.730

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.320

It is dif? cult.

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.840
It is very far.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:29.500
I do not can ...

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:31.900
Traveling on the express route

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:43.100

- A connection problem.

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.000
Help Me.

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:46.220
? Nenita, are you?

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.410

- Seven and a half.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:52.600
- I hate this place.

01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:11.350
Sorry dear,

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.640
But you promised.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.860
Mama must help the boy
to serve his country.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.420
Sit in the living room,
Frankie and you.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.110
Place the radio.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.500
Sweetie, even

01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:32.500
Nice to meet you, Johnny.

I am Ann.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.680
Ann Bowman.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.300
She was furious.
? I wanted revenge!

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:44.510
Take Frankie park
in front.

01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:46.830
Please do not make me
continue.

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:47.790
It's necessary.

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.510
? What happened after?

01:19:50.190 --> 01:19:52.970
I wanted to push him
increasingly strong ...

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.200
so he could
reach the clouds.

01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:58.930
Then he said:
"Let me go around the world"

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.900
? It was me! ? It was me!
? I killed him!

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:12.450
It was my fault.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.200
When Florence lost memory
com not take a miracle of God.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.950
Jure we would

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.850
Change my name and
we moved from town.

01:20:23.075 --> 01:20:24.740
Mother, hold me.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.460

? This is the best story
I've heard in years!

01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:35.480
This is the project that may prove
my talent as a dramatic actress.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:36.580
? A story?

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.270
A surfer with a split personality.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.400

Not so fast, Nenita.

01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:07.710
We do not would measure
this straitjacket.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.190
But I did not kill?
these people ...

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:12.825

01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:16.110
Someone racked

01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:19.580
It is taken to destroy
other excluded.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.910
Ms. Forrest, est? under arrest.

01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:25.400

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.360
? What do they do?
They make a mistake.

01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:30.140
Time to go sister.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.050

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:35.290
? I am innocent!

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.950
Enough.
The dungeon.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:37.800
? Let me go!

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.680
I do not move from here.
Try to get me.

01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:46.140
It Señora, this me

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:47.950
Please do not hurt her.

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.780
There will come out of this alive,
damn bastards ...

01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:57.500
My mother? A killer?

01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.755
? What happens now?

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:04.070

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.150
No need to apologize
my best friend.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:15.900
Debi have helped.
I did not do anything for you.

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:22.480
They should go home.

01:22:23.545 --> 01:22:24.430
I think that ...

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.710
I'll stay a little longer.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.126
I can bring to Florence
to home.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:37.440
Lars, you picked a lousy
family to live here.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
It does not worry me.

01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:45.220
? As what I can thank you?

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:49.480
Take back Nenita
that's all I want.

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.600
I have enough
just one.

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:54.810
? We go?

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.145
Florence ...

01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:20.880
this must be the worst
what happened to you.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.210
It is worthy of being in the Top 10.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.780
Your mother failed
help herself.

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:28.840
In their own way ...

01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:32.870
He thought he was saving
those poor people.

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:38.010
I'm in no mood to talk,
if you do not mind.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.900
I understand completely.

01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:48.720
However, I surprised me
find out your mental problem.

01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:53.205
I always saw you as a typical
American girl balanced.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.698
Almost boring.

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.105
Sorry if you disappointment ?.

01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:00.960
There is so much ugliness in the world.

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:05.065
? Be? that there the
perfect person?

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.840
All these revelations
They have given me hungry.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.380
? Because we do not stop
eat something?

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.640
I think not.

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.230
Psychologically not fit.
It can not be Mrs. Forrest.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.700
Nenita poor.
Should not be alone.

01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:30.030
Luckily Lars is? with her.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.815
If, Lars.

01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:35.870
You got a picture of the
fam? lia Elkins?

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.000
? Those who were killed?

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.600
I put it in the drawer n.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.470
Starcat, what do you do?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.150
? Because you're hiding from me?
I just want help.

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:52.470
? I you pass the mustard?

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.470
Lars ...

01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:55.500
? Que le pas? your accent?

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:58.550
And I do not need at last
I can be myself.

01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:01.690
Call me Larry.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:02.730
? Larry ...

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.145
Elkins?

01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:07.210
Nice to meet you. Although
this also? n is a goodbye.

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:09.030
Be? better back.

01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:11.810
You are crazy.
Give me the knife.

01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:13.900
I'm asking you
gently.

01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:14.730
Give me the knife!

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.200
Of course you would give? ...

01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:17.835
You're going to hell, imb? Cyl.

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:23.425
? A crime!

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.200
? Ahi is? the Dodge!
They must be at the drive.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.900
How could you do that
to your family?

01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:45.750
They were like the others.
No one understands.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.880
Try it. I can
very comprehensive.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.425
You can not imagine what it is
Growing up in a house abnormal.

01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:53.170
My mother was blind ...

01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:54.380
My father was deaf ....

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.630
My sisters were tiny.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.350
They had to die for
to be free.

01:26:59.730 --> 01:27:03.320
? And I porqu ?? I'm your friend.
Pursuan you? the pants.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.330
? And now I'll fix it!

01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:42.040
? Look! There is? N.

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:01.610
Alone at last.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.970
? Larry, please, no!

01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:10.230
I have you.
As he imagined.

01:28:12.765 --> 01:28:15.440
? You, pathetic little worm!

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.200
No man does
Ann Bowman suffer.

01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:18.800
? What?

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.860
you are weak. You disgust me.

01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:25.820
Like being humiliated
? True?

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:27.300
? Help Me!

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:27.950
? Nenita!

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.110
Starcat.

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:32.210
The dog was gone.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.090
? Now you go you!

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:37.615
? Boot knife!

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.070
Obligame.

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.050
Poor Larry.

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:52.460
I tell him.

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.245
I see the circle,
and I'm still me.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.600
Est? S cured.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.420
I remember that movement.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:21.812
? It was good?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:23.934
Very good.

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:27.970
You want to fight?

01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:30.360
As in a championship.

01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:32.360
Let's go from here.

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:42.200
We have much to improve.

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.000
Maybe I should greet
psychiatrist.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.010
Serious best.
I'm proof of that.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.970
I must return to classes.

01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:53.250
Let? S all atr? S.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:55.370
Not all.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.100
I was wondering ...

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:00.560
? You would use my pencil?

01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:02.940
? I would love to!

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:13.990
Florence ...

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.220
Florence ...

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:16.300
Florence, wake up.

01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:17.950
Awake.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.100
You must get up.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.320
I was dreaming.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.900
It's time for treatment.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.300
? You were in my dream!

01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:50.650
You too.

01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:52.630
Bites.

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.430
? And you!

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
So? Masters silly things
when we are sick.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:01.545
? Kisses!

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.860
? So it was all a dream?
? What a stupid thing!

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.610
It was based on a
true story.

01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:24.070
? I am glad that Ann Bowman
est? locked up for life!

01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:26.250
Non est? N so sure about that.
