Oh. Hello, Metropolis.
I'm Lex Luthor.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.418
When I first started Lexcorp,

00:27.505 --> 00:28.593
I didn't set out to create

00:28.680 --> 00:30.639
an international
corporate empire

00:30.726 --> 00:32.641
that would make me
the youngest mega-billionaire
in the world.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.295
I did it for you.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.384

this morning in Midtown,

01:15.423 --> 01:18.339

may finally have arrived.

I knew it! I knew it!

08:21.065 --> 08:23.067
I knew it the minute
I saw you dent that car door

because no ordinary person
could possibly slam
a door that hard.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.463
And then when you spilled
all those weird

I knew there was
something weird
going on with you, too.

08:29.465 --> 08:30.814

had your backpack,

08:30.901 --> 08:32.294

"That's weird."

08:32.381 --> 08:33.687
And then I overheard you

08:33.774 --> 08:35.166
about some Corps thing
and some ring

08:35.253 --> 08:37.517

08:37.604 --> 08:38.518
so I decided to start
a food fight so that
we all get detention together,

08:38.605 --> 08:40.389

I wasn't planning
on you showing up at all.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.827
So that's just like
a huge bonus anyway.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.263
My plan was that
you'd all keep fighting
once we got to detention

08:45.350 --> 08:47.004
and all get so worked up
that you'd be forced

08:47.091 --> 08:48.919

09:45.802 --> 09:47.978

bestowed upon you.

Plus, come on, you guys!

How can you not be excited
about heroes and villains

09:51.373 --> 09:52.504
and fighting crime
and hidden lairs

09:52.592 --> 09:53.984
and secret identities
and stuff?

09:54.071 --> 09:56.421
Um, the trick with
secret identities, my dear,

09:56.508 --> 09:58.162
is that,
in order to remain secret,

09:58.249 --> 10:01.035
one must convincingly
pass as a normal human being.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.514
Okay, tell you what.

You guys give being a team
a teensie try,

10:05.126 --> 10:06.344

how to be heroes

10:06.431 --> 10:08.477

give her a makeover.

-Deal?

10:09.913 --> 10:12.089

no to a makeover?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.569
Um... Okay.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.571
Good for you, Karen.
I'll try, too,

10:15.658 --> 10:18.443

and encourage Karen's
brave decision.

Fine. Whatever.
