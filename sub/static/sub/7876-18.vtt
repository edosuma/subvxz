Transcript: Koni, Pipit, mpm

00:25.484 --> 00:27.485
Synchro: mpm

00:38.000 --> 00:40.471
- Hey, buckle, that's my seat.
- Not anymore.

00:40.596 --> 00:43.954
See, I'm more important than you,
I've got some big stuff going on,

00:44.079 --> 00:45.160
big stuff.

00:45.393 --> 00:46.941
I'm going to flick your tie.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.508
You're titillate, don't you?

00:49.633 --> 00:52.199
But it's the 50's and you don't know
what to do with those feelings.

00:52.324 --> 00:55.308
Meet me in the bathroom.
I'll drill a hole between the stalls.

01:01.413 --> 01:04.757
Excuse me, I'm goin' to take
your free game. I'm that important.

01:04.882 --> 01:07.230
I've got some big stuff goin' on.

01:07.355 --> 01:10.353
Now, watch me play.
I suck but I do my own sounds effects.

01:17.631 --> 01:18.590
Refill.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.768
I'm sorry, we don't give refills.

01:20.970 --> 01:22.695
I see, you don't know who I am.

01:22.820 --> 01:26.204
I can't talk about it,
but I've got some big stuff goin' on.

01:26.329 --> 01:27.622
Now, fill that up.

01:27.868 --> 01:29.840
That's right, I'm important.

01:32.389 --> 01:34.669
Man, cafeÃ¯ne doesn't affect me
at all.

01:36.175 --> 01:37.751
I can do anything!

01:43.478 --> 01:44.798
Diner is almost ready.

01:44.923 --> 01:47.558
I'm doing one of Rachael Ray's
30 minutes meals.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.779
But I'm saving 10 minutes
by not being all fake and smiley.

01:51.269 --> 01:52.493
Work sucked today.

01:52.618 --> 01:55.002
I got passed over
for the Chavez assassination.

01:55.127 --> 01:56.059
Again.

01:56.184 --> 02:00.008
Another assassination season
stuck to in an inventory with Mitchell.

02:00.133 --> 02:02.364
"Call me Mitch."
Stop trying so hard.

02:02.575 --> 02:06.542
Anyway, everthing will be OK
as soon as I have this delicious...

02:08.377 --> 02:09.249
Nice.

02:14.904 --> 02:17.380
Look, Stan, I had a long day too,
you know.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.995
Exhausting, having so much big stuff

02:20.120 --> 02:21.807
Big stuff goin' on here.

02:21.932 --> 02:25.617
That's because it's true.
I'm pretty important. I need this.

02:26.620 --> 02:29.991
- I've a lot goin' on here on earth.
- You know what, just stop.

02:30.116 --> 02:33.264
I'm sick of you acting like you're
the most important person in the world.

02:33.389 --> 02:36.052
- But the truth is...
- Here comes the thruth from Stan.

02:36.177 --> 02:38.148
- Truth is...
- Everybody make way for Stan,

02:38.273 --> 02:40.249
- Comin' through with the truth.
- The truth is...

02:40.374 --> 02:42.550
Here's the truth coming at you
live via Stan.

02:42.675 --> 02:43.731
Roger, shut up!

02:43.856 --> 02:47.109
The truth is you're nothing
but a worthless sack of fat ass.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.057
You're lazy, you're a chubbo,
you lie,

02:49.182 --> 02:50.865
you cheat, you eat all,
you're a drunk,

02:50.990 --> 02:53.014
- you never wash your wigs,
- you strut around

02:53.139 --> 02:56.208
like you're Mary, Queen of Scots, Jesus
and Brangelina all rolled into one.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.761
Well, you're not!
You're a big fat nothing!

03:02.232 --> 03:03.232
All right.

03:03.858 --> 03:05.751
Well, that's it, you did it.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.970
The real truth is,

03:08.095 --> 03:11.034
I do have big stuff goin' on,
and here it is.

03:11.535 --> 03:12.372
I'm...

03:12.609 --> 03:13.921
the decider.

03:14.326 --> 03:15.444
The decider?

03:15.612 --> 03:17.839
I was sent here,
on a top secret mission,

03:17.964 --> 03:20.775
to decide if the people of earth,
should live or die.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.165
And what you just said there,
you crossed the line, buddy.

03:24.344 --> 03:25.287
I've decided.

03:26.533 --> 03:28.569
A decider?
What is that?

03:28.694 --> 03:31.556
Some new Lea Thompson
legal thriller on Lifetime?

03:31.681 --> 03:34.223
Let me guess. She's a judge,
she has a hard time dating,

03:34.348 --> 03:36.614
- she rides a bike to...
- I decided, Stan.

03:36.739 --> 03:39.784
I'm going to my fortress of solitude,
outside Roswell

03:39.909 --> 03:43.138
and sending a message to my people
to blow this dump of a planet up.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.462
You're going to Roswell
to blow up Earth?

03:45.587 --> 03:46.775
- Right now?
- Yes.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.726
- Great, I'll come along.
- Good.

03:48.851 --> 03:50.685
When I'll bend over
to push the button,

03:50.810 --> 03:53.051
my ass will be the last thing
you'll ever see.

03:53.176 --> 03:55.853
I'm going to go brush my teeth,
and then we'll go send the signal.

03:55.978 --> 03:58.584
Cause of you, bitch. Call your mother,
tell her you killed her.

03:58.709 --> 04:00.193
I'll do that, thanks.

04:01.490 --> 04:02.679
Stan, come on.

04:02.969 --> 04:05.710
You hurt is feeling,
so he is made some stuff up.

04:05.835 --> 04:08.148
Don't make Roger go
all the way to Roswell,

04:08.331 --> 04:11.746
- to stick on all his baloney.
- Sorry Francine, but he asked for it.

04:11.871 --> 04:15.656
I'm tired of him walking around here
like is king poop all the time

04:17.182 --> 04:19.351
Is that really
what you wanted to say?

04:25.139 --> 04:27.166
Look at me, I'm a walrus.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.775
I guess he went to the bathroom
to laugh in private.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.760
No, he went to get his sister.

04:37.885 --> 04:39.236
Oh, hey, Kiko.

04:44.269 --> 04:45.854
Toshi is greatly offended.

04:45.979 --> 04:49.037
Those chops sticks were carved
in the femur of our great grand mother.

04:49.865 --> 04:50.706
Gross!

04:55.645 --> 04:59.440
Until now, Toshi has stoicly tolerated
your boorish jokes.

04:59.739 --> 05:01.341
- But no more.
- Kiko,

05:01.466 --> 05:03.485
- listen.
- Do not interrupt!

05:05.316 --> 05:06.905
Toshi issues a challenge.

05:07.970 --> 05:10.074
You will compete in the arena
of your choosing.

05:14.497 --> 05:16.613
The loser will switch
to the later lunch period,

05:16.738 --> 05:18.690
so you'll never have to eat
together again.

05:20.777 --> 05:22.890
- Unless you care to apologize.
- What?

05:23.015 --> 05:25.981
Apologize for being hilarious?
Never.

05:26.559 --> 05:27.631
Very well.

05:27.756 --> 05:30.703
Come to our house tomorrow
to choose your challenge.

05:32.809 --> 05:35.371
Anyone else get a boner
when Kiko slapped me?

05:36.684 --> 05:38.825
Me neither.
Got to go.

05:39.281 --> 05:40.814
You know what's funny?

05:40.939 --> 05:42.474
Walking like a gorilla.

05:49.284 --> 05:51.316
Why can't you send
your pretend message

05:51.441 --> 05:53.791
to blow up earth to your own planet
on your cell phone?

05:53.916 --> 05:55.816
It's not pretend, butt face.

05:55.941 --> 05:58.698
<i>Southwestern Airlines would like
to welcome all of it passengers</i>

05:58.823 --> 06:00.381
<i>in boarding group B.</i>

06:00.506 --> 06:02.771
What?
I'm a C. How you've got a B?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.571
Pre-orderer while you were packing.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.423
You know what? Good.
Enjoy your B boarding pass.

06:07.548 --> 06:09.929
Cause you're gonna be obliterated!

06:10.316 --> 06:11.716
I got him good.

06:11.841 --> 06:13.829
Did you hear that alphabet humor,
Arab guy?

06:13.954 --> 06:15.109
You can't make jokes.

06:15.234 --> 06:17.323
You make a joke,
you get thrown out the plane.

06:17.448 --> 06:19.711
Sad, but that's the world
we live in now.

06:26.879 --> 06:29.212
<i>Now boarding group C and higher.</i>

06:30.093 --> 06:32.478
Sorry, there's no more room
on the plane.

06:32.603 --> 06:35.308
- I'm going to have to check your bag.
- Can't I put it on my lap?

06:36.156 --> 06:39.146
But I wanted to go straight from
the airport to my fortress of solitude.

06:39.271 --> 06:41.659
I don't want to have to wait for...
It doesn't matter,

06:41.784 --> 06:44.314
I have bigger thing on my plan,
much much bigger things.

06:49.721 --> 06:51.535
Comfy there, Mr Decider?

07:04.008 --> 07:06.599
- Sir, my seat won't go back.
- Yeah, that one is broken.

07:06.724 --> 07:08.488
But I have a bad back.

07:10.348 --> 07:13.236
Behold my fortress of solitude.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.026
Impressive.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.344
Afternoon, so generous.

07:20.469 --> 07:21.775
Strawberry Coors?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.271
It's something I invented.

07:23.396 --> 07:26.925
I take a regular Coors
and I drink it through a Twizzler.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.992
I really like your roommate.
Nice touch with the rolling.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.740
Don't want open the door to wide

07:33.865 --> 07:36.329
and let Disability Check Dan
over there, see your...

07:37.225 --> 07:39.206
Fortress of solitude.

07:39.681 --> 07:40.991
Oh good Lord, it's real.

07:41.116 --> 07:43.889
You know Stan, it's too bad.
I actually like Francine.

07:44.014 --> 07:46.829
The rest of it can suck it,
but Francine I'm sorry to see die.

07:48.495 --> 07:51.421
Roger, we joke a lot, me and you...

07:51.546 --> 07:53.867
You know that deep, deep in my heart,
I always...

07:53.992 --> 07:55.188
Too late, Stan.

07:55.313 --> 07:57.512
You've sealed your fate and now,

07:58.327 --> 07:59.559
What is wrong?

07:59.684 --> 08:00.968
What the...

08:01.184 --> 08:02.214
Why is a...

08:02.339 --> 08:04.204
"Dear humans
who discover this wreck.

08:04.329 --> 08:05.648
"Please, disregard it.

08:05.773 --> 08:07.889
"We crashed this ship
into your planet

08:08.014 --> 08:09.679
"to test new safety features

08:09.804 --> 08:11.885
"because we care
about our customers.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.350
"The alien inside is merely
a crash test dummy

08:15.475 --> 08:17.762
"who most likely died upon impact."

08:18.813 --> 08:20.637
A crash test dummy?

08:21.049 --> 08:22.405
But they told me...

08:23.919 --> 08:25.161
The decider!

08:25.286 --> 08:27.406
That is classic!
I'm loving this!

08:32.178 --> 08:35.392
- No, this can't be.
- Excuse me, gentlemen,

08:35.638 --> 08:38.208
if I just found out
I'm the Lindberg baby,

08:38.465 --> 08:39.943
whom do I tell?

09:15.333 --> 09:16.415
I'm sure by now

09:16.540 --> 09:19.671
Toshi's realised that is the one
who owes me an apology.

09:19.909 --> 09:22.821
For making me put parts
of his great grandmother in my mouth.

09:22.946 --> 09:24.755
I had Japanese great grandma once.

09:25.036 --> 09:27.052
I had the Shinto's for a week.

09:28.399 --> 09:29.358
Thank you!

09:38.211 --> 09:40.206
Choose your method of challenge.

09:40.474 --> 09:43.450
Each character represents
an ancient Japanese ritual.

09:45.311 --> 09:46.311
Very well.

09:51.192 --> 09:52.686
So it is chosen.

09:53.534 --> 09:55.832
- Wait. What did I choose?
- Hot dog eating contest.

10:03.839 --> 10:05.274
I'm screwed, man.

10:05.399 --> 10:07.863
I can't beat a tiny Asian boy
at eating hot dogs.

10:07.988 --> 10:09.706
Well, you better start training.

10:09.831 --> 10:12.032
You don't want to switch
to the later lunch period.

10:12.157 --> 10:15.730
That's when the guy with the milky eyes
start moping up around the tables.

10:15.855 --> 10:19.276
Why do they make eye patches
if not for that exact situation.

10:19.559 --> 10:21.346
Maybe he can afford one.

10:21.619 --> 10:23.204
See now, I bummed out.

10:26.949 --> 10:28.710
Roger, how was Roswell?

10:31.325 --> 10:34.067
- What happened?
- Well, for the last 70 years,

10:34.278 --> 10:36.629
Roger thought he was
the decider of humanity.

10:36.795 --> 10:39.095
But it turns out,
he's just a crash test dummy.

10:39.359 --> 10:42.095
- Oh, the poor thing.
- Poor thing, please.

10:42.220 --> 10:44.058
Trust me,
he'll shake it off in an hour.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.273
Roger, will you please come out?

10:52.553 --> 10:54.152
We made your favorite meal.

10:54.508 --> 10:58.407
Roast squab with a burger
di pana reduction and truffle risotto.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.293
And toasted brioche?

11:00.418 --> 11:01.440
Of course.

11:03.434 --> 11:06.709
Well, there is place set at the table
if you change your mind.

11:11.857 --> 11:13.944
OK, Roger, you can do this.

11:14.276 --> 11:16.761
Just pick yourself up
and started new.

11:18.954 --> 11:21.357
Oh, look who decided
to come to dinner?

11:29.011 --> 11:31.436
Hey, little guy, want a waffle?

11:34.068 --> 11:35.609
He is coming in, look.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.131
Roger, it's OK.

11:44.395 --> 11:47.010
Stan didn't mean
any of those things he said.

11:47.890 --> 11:49.351
No, he's right.

11:49.906 --> 11:52.393
I'm not the most important person
on earth.

11:52.596 --> 11:54.304
I have no special purpose.

11:54.429 --> 11:55.651
Don't say that.

11:55.776 --> 11:58.416
There are a lot of things to do
besides blow up earth.

11:58.541 --> 12:01.803
Maybe you could get a job.
You know, do something with your life.

12:02.067 --> 12:02.971
I guess.

12:03.892 --> 12:06.849
- Are my hot dogs ready, Mum?
- Wouldn't you rather have a waffle?

12:07.154 --> 12:09.936
No madam, only hot dogs
until day of the showdown.

12:14.424 --> 12:17.267
Thanks again for teaching me
how to retain my gag reflex.

12:17.392 --> 12:18.491
You're welcome.

12:19.442 --> 12:20.525
Hot dogs, uh?

12:21.158 --> 12:22.347
I like hot dogs.

12:22.472 --> 12:24.891
Maybe I'll get some sort of hot dog
related job.

12:25.385 --> 12:28.241
You mean, like making hot dogs,
or selling hot dogs.

12:28.366 --> 12:31.695
I don't know, I just had the idea.
Will you only think for just one moment?

12:31.820 --> 12:34.408
I come up with good ideas
and you nailed me with questions.

12:34.533 --> 12:37.341
Probably something supervisory
in the distribution department.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.673
There we go, I knew I think
of it if you give me a moment.

12:46.369 --> 12:47.575
You did it, Roger.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.079
Assistant regional distribution manager
for Hot Dog Hauss.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.183
On your way back to the top.

12:53.593 --> 12:55.732
I need you to refill
the ink in the stamp.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.540
- Can I decide what color?
- No, it's red.

12:59.283 --> 13:01.709
Hey Roger, there's a new hot dog house
in Chimdale.

13:01.834 --> 13:04.949
You need me to decide how many hot dogs
to send them for the grand opening?

13:05.074 --> 13:07.507
No, just letting you know
that our company's growing.

13:08.258 --> 13:10.527
Hey Roger, we've got
a bad batch of hot dogs here.

13:10.652 --> 13:13.945
Nitrate level in them is lethal.
Make they get throwing out, would you?

13:14.070 --> 13:17.918
- You mean, I'm in charge of something?
- Yeah, sure.

13:18.043 --> 13:20.674
You're president of throwing out
bad wieners.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.007
Congratulations.

13:22.523 --> 13:24.134
Lethal, uh?

13:24.495 --> 13:26.546
The decider is back.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.159
Bathroom material.

13:32.284 --> 13:35.064
This VIP has to VI peepee.

13:35.751 --> 13:37.468
Yeah, I do it sitting down.

13:37.593 --> 13:39.366
'Cause comfort is king.

13:39.491 --> 13:41.736
- And I have no wen.
- What the hell, I was reading that.

13:42.033 --> 13:45.406
I'm sorry Stan, but I have got
some big stuff goin' on.

13:45.849 --> 13:48.503
I'm going to take this
in case I get cold on the toilet.

13:49.648 --> 13:51.919
Here we go again,
he gets a crappy job,

13:52.044 --> 13:53.886
and he's acting like
he owns the world.

13:54.011 --> 13:58.011
I'm going down to that hot dog place
and I'm setting that weirdo straight.

13:58.163 --> 14:02.163
Do you think it's worth taking all
this sick days to make him feel bad?

14:02.440 --> 14:04.856
I've got it cover,
I told 'em that you had a baby.

14:04.981 --> 14:06.435
This is from Jackson.

14:07.376 --> 14:10.109
Che Guevara?
Is this supposed to be hip?

14:10.234 --> 14:11.376
He was a murderer.

14:11.501 --> 14:14.243
Just put him in it one time
when you bring him to the office.

14:14.368 --> 14:15.454
I guess.

14:20.975 --> 14:24.602
Stan, you came to see me at work,
like a wife.

14:24.919 --> 14:26.768
I just stopped by
to show you something.

14:26.893 --> 14:29.826
I downloaded this chart
of Hot Dog Hauss corporate structure.

14:30.194 --> 14:31.778
Look, there's the parent company

14:31.903 --> 14:34.081
there is the subsidiary,
there is the branch of food co.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.581
that presides over Hot Dog Hauss,
there is Hot Dog Hauss

14:36.706 --> 14:39.085
there is east central division,
there this warehouse,

14:39.253 --> 14:41.712
and this tiny little box here,
is you.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.061
- Still feel important?
- Yes, I do,

14:44.186 --> 14:46.582
cause I have some big stuff goin'...

14:46.707 --> 14:48.318
No, you don't.
You have nothing.

14:48.443 --> 14:50.959
- So stop acting like a big shot.
- OK, Stan.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.769
I'll let you know a little secret.

14:52.894 --> 14:55.419
I found this dogs
so full of nitrate,

14:55.544 --> 14:57.409
that each one can kill a man.

14:57.607 --> 15:00.536
I called them, death dogs.
And I'm in charge of them.

15:00.661 --> 15:02.233
- Me.
- What are you talking about?

15:02.564 --> 15:05.626
Any time I want,
I can let out some bad wieners.

15:05.751 --> 15:06.705
See, Stan.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.067
- I'm the decider again.
- Oh yeah?

15:09.397 --> 15:11.534
Where do you keep
these alleged death dogs?

15:11.800 --> 15:14.063
They're not here,
they're some place safe.

15:14.266 --> 15:16.291
Some place you'll never guess.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.583
The last place
you'd ever think to look.

15:19.042 --> 15:21.460
No, don't look in the fridge,
they're not in there.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.588
- They're not in there.
- They're not?

15:26.713 --> 15:28.926
Oh boy, let's think,
who could have taken them?

15:29.213 --> 15:31.862
Francine took them
to Steve's hot dog eating contest.

15:31.987 --> 15:33.746
Damn it!
Roger, what have you done?

15:33.871 --> 15:36.762
- Do you know what this means?
- Of course I know what this means.

15:36.887 --> 15:39.361
I just missed my chance to sing
"Who let the dogs out".

15:39.486 --> 15:41.307
Would have been perfect
a moment ago.

15:41.432 --> 15:43.375
You know
who would've really appreciate it?

15:43.500 --> 15:45.899
Steve. Too bad he is probably dead.

15:49.003 --> 15:50.988
You idiot!
You may have killed my son.

15:51.113 --> 15:52.217
There's still time.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.862
Where did Steve said
the hot dog contest was?

15:55.637 --> 15:58.572
God, I don't know.
He must have told me a thousand times.

15:58.697 --> 16:00.580
- I know, me too.
- I totally...

16:00.705 --> 16:02.336
I zone out
when that kid is speaking.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.927
You have to. It's the only way
you can get through diner.

16:05.052 --> 16:06.707
Steve is at Toshi's house.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.785
That's where
the hot dog eating contest is.

16:08.910 --> 16:10.800
What?
Why didn't you say something before?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.554
Daddy and Roger were fighting
and I got scared.

16:14.249 --> 16:17.277
Hopefully you'll pick up this voice mail
before you eat a hot dog.

16:17.607 --> 16:20.472
And if not, if you're listening to this
from heaven,

16:20.736 --> 16:22.020
I love you, kiddo.

16:22.392 --> 16:23.941
Well, I warned Toshi.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.690
You're blocking me, we're taking
your car. Give me the keys.

16:26.815 --> 16:29.307
Fine, you can drive.
But a word of warning,

16:29.553 --> 16:32.397
This car is an ass magnet.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.701
When the whistle blows,
the contest begins.

16:36.169 --> 16:40.003
Whoever finishes the most hot dogs
in ten minutes, wins.

16:40.232 --> 16:41.746
Vomit will disqualify.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.523
OK.
Looks our left on Reservoir Lane.

16:46.648 --> 16:48.567
Never heard of it.
Let me see.

16:48.952 --> 16:51.171
Roger, this a poster of Bo Derek.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.886
Have you ever seen cheekbones...
Look out!

17:04.868 --> 17:07.260
You really do make
a good crash test dummy.

17:07.385 --> 17:08.567
Shut up and drive!

17:11.635 --> 17:13.155
Nobody eat the hot dogs.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.324
Death dogs.
They're called death dogs.

17:15.566 --> 17:17.451
They've eaten 38.

17:17.766 --> 17:19.078
Get away from the table.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.702
You weren't supposed to eat those.
They're poisonous.

17:21.827 --> 17:23.082
You're going to die.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.890
Don't you mean, "Oh my Godzilla"?

17:28.015 --> 17:29.093
Thank you.

17:29.634 --> 17:31.756
What have we done?
I'm sorry.

17:31.994 --> 17:34.107
I should have said that
in the first place.

17:34.232 --> 17:35.511
Forgive me?

17:39.260 --> 17:42.271
Toshi is honour bound
to accept a death bed apology.

17:42.747 --> 17:46.277
Goodbye then, dear Toshi.
I should have been nicer to you.

17:46.621 --> 17:49.316
You're my only friend
who wasn't poor or fat.

17:50.724 --> 17:53.736
Oh wait, false alarm.
I still have my death dogs.

17:54.029 --> 17:57.190
Toshi's mother insisted on using
the hot dogs she bought.

17:57.453 --> 17:59.901
Apparently the ones I brought
weren't good enough.

18:00.026 --> 18:02.687
They weren't.
They would have killed our children.

18:02.872 --> 18:06.250
I'm sorry dear, I don't understand
what you're saying.

18:06.782 --> 18:09.256
Does anyone speaks sushi hostess?

18:09.588 --> 18:12.936
The important thing is that Roger
didn't end up killing anyone.

18:13.702 --> 18:14.987
Where is Roger?

18:16.497 --> 18:18.997
Sorry Stan, I can't let you
destroy these.

18:19.122 --> 18:21.317
They're all I have.
I need them.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.383
I'm worthless now.

18:36.508 --> 18:39.033
I'm a nobody,
just like everyone else.

18:39.245 --> 18:41.428
And it's about time you said it.

18:41.652 --> 18:44.161
Damn it, Stan,
why can't you give Roger a break?

18:44.286 --> 18:46.555
Why should I?
Nobody gives me a break.

18:46.798 --> 18:49.126
I don't see why he gets
to feel important when I don't.

18:49.584 --> 18:52.798
So, that's why you're being
such a jerk to Roger.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.577
You feel like a nobody

18:54.702 --> 18:57.755
so you can't let
Roger feel like a somebody.

18:58.099 --> 19:00.062
Oh, my God.
You're right.

19:00.898 --> 19:03.641
It must be so obvious to everyone
if you picked up on it.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.687
Stan, you're not a nobody.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.927
You're important to me
and to Steve and Hayley.

19:10.052 --> 19:11.578
And even to Roger.

19:11.703 --> 19:14.272
You're so important to him
that he was going to blow up

19:14.397 --> 19:16.760
the whole world
because you insulted him.

19:18.093 --> 19:20.409
I never really thought
about it that way.

19:23.032 --> 19:24.089
Hey, Roger.

19:24.568 --> 19:26.197
I owe you an apology.

19:26.848 --> 19:27.975
I'm sorry.

19:28.789 --> 19:30.823
I just want to feel like I matter.

19:30.948 --> 19:32.178
I know, me too.

19:32.597 --> 19:35.228
- We're not so different, you and I.
- Yes we are.

19:35.353 --> 19:38.459
We're night and day, except
for n this specific instance. So here.

19:38.584 --> 19:40.970
- What is it?
- I'm allergic to shellfish.

19:41.095 --> 19:44.624
If I accidentally eat any, my throat
will swell up and I would die.

19:44.932 --> 19:46.737
This is my EpiPen.

19:46.862 --> 19:49.604
I keep it with me at all times,
to get myself a shot,

19:49.729 --> 19:50.995
just in case.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.564
You're giving it to me?

19:52.941 --> 19:56.927
If having the power over life and death
is what it takes to feel special,

19:57.052 --> 19:58.082
then, yes.

19:58.593 --> 19:59.887
When the time comes

20:00.012 --> 20:02.448
you can decide,
whether I live or die.

20:02.758 --> 20:05.451
You make me the decider again.

20:06.513 --> 20:07.921
Enjoy it, buddy.

20:08.216 --> 20:10.734
Hey, you guys, I'm the decider.

20:12.976 --> 20:15.796
I guess today,
isn't these groundhogs...

20:16.515 --> 20:17.422
day.

20:23.946 --> 20:26.280
- What are you doing?
- CSI Miami.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.687
- Caruso?
- Just gets you creeper, Daren.

20:34.816 --> 20:37.694
- Freshly baked cookies.
- Wow, thank you, Roger.

20:37.819 --> 20:41.101
And sorry I acted like an entitled ass
for the last 70 years.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.862
Roger, what's this?

20:45.987 --> 20:48.363
Crawfish cookies.
Need this?

20:50.124 --> 20:52.703
My God, his allergy.
Roger, give him the shot.

20:52.828 --> 20:54.332
Not so fast, Francine.

20:54.457 --> 20:56.058
I'm the decider.

20:56.183 --> 20:58.092
- And I will decide...
- Roger!

20:58.217 --> 20:59.839
And I decide to give him the shot.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.411
- It's empty.
- But I only used it once.

21:02.536 --> 21:04.970
I was super hungover
and I wanted an adrenaline rush.

21:05.362 --> 21:08.301
It felt amazing.
