03:27.457 --> 03:29.417
What's that ambulance
doing out there?

03:29.585 --> 03:32.295
I don't know. I'll check it out.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.270
-Evening, sir.
-How's it going, Griff?

03:49.438 --> 03:52.023
I can't complain and won't.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.608
-That him?
-Yep.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.194
Might just be some crackpot,
but I figured I should call you anyway.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.739
-Did he ask for me by name?
-Nope.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.325
Asked for the agent in charge
of the God's Hand case.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.784
Said he had important info.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.661
-Didn't say what?
-Nope.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.205
Said he'd only talk to you.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.714
You the agent in charge
of the God's Hand case?

04:17.089 --> 04:20.426
That's right. Wesley Doyle.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.304
That's a picture of
you and your mother, huh?

04:24.806 --> 04:27.975
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
take things off of my desk.

04:28.143 --> 04:32.104
I'm sorry about that.
Guess I've been in here a while.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.651
Already had a look at all
your plaques and your citations.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.528
Didn't really care
to have a look at those.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.996
So, what can I do for you, Mr...?

04:49.164 --> 04:52.708
Meiks. Name's Fenton Meiks.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.338
Now, listen, this may sound
a little bit crazy, but...

04:59.675 --> 05:01.842
...I know who the God's Hand killer is.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.762
All right, I'll bite.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.181
Who?

05:07.766 --> 05:11.018
You haven't even heard me out yet
and already you doubt me.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.021
Why is that?

05:15.190 --> 05:16.649
Because in a case like this...

05:16.817 --> 05:19.402
...nobody just walks in
and tells you who the killer is.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.696
It just doesn't happen that way.

05:22.072 --> 05:25.533
Sometimes truth defies reason,
Agent Doyle.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.076
Yeah?

05:27.244 --> 05:28.452
So who is it, then?

05:30.038 --> 05:31.998
My brother.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.792
What makes you think that?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.879
I got a call from him.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.048
Last night.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.720
I wonder where he could be,
I'm getting worried.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.471
Are you, darling? What about?

05:47.639 --> 05:49.223
Hello?

05:50.017 --> 05:53.769
-Hello?
-Demons are taking over the world.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.396
--to be going on a honeymoon....

05:55.564 --> 05:56.856
Adam?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.733
I can't destroy them all.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.027
They're everywhere.
I can't take it anymore.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.903
Now, let's talk about this, Adam.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.574
Look, there's nothing to talk about.
It's over.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.703
Whatever happens, you have to take me
to the rose garden.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.747
You promised. Remember?

06:12.914 --> 06:14.999
-Now, sit still, listen to-- Adam.
-Remember?

06:15.167 --> 06:17.334
Remember, you promised.

06:17.961 --> 06:21.922
We will find him. Go on, go on.
Go find your dog. Hurry up.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.455
Meat?

06:54.623 --> 06:56.791
That's where all this took place.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.960
It's about 200 miles west of here,
just north of Abilene.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.421
Now, why'd you go to Thurman?

07:02.589 --> 07:05.424
To bury Adam in the rose garden.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.967
Why would you do that?

07:07.135 --> 07:10.930
I promised him I would
a long time ago.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.559
Now, that's a pretty wild story,
Mr. Meiks.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.271
I don't see what, if anything,
this has got to do with my case.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.025
Adam is the God's Hand killer,
Agent Doyle.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.320
He's the one you're looking for.

07:26.488 --> 07:30.157
Did he tell you that before he asked you
to take him to Thurman?

07:30.325 --> 07:33.953
-If that's the case, you left that part out.
-I haven't finished yet.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.498
-Oh, there's more?
-A lot more.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.501
Excuse me a minute.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.765
Meat sheriff's office.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.809
Can I talk to the sheriff there,
please?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.645
This is Agent Wesley Doyle
of the FBI.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.481
He's not in right now. May I help you?

08:02.649 --> 08:05.359
Well, we got a man here in my office,
name of Fenton Meiks.

08:05.527 --> 08:09.029
Fenton Meiks? What's he doing there?

08:09.573 --> 08:11.699
-You know him?
-Well, yeah.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.201
He caused a bit of a ruckus
here earlier.

08:14.369 --> 08:18.038
He stole an ambulance
and his brother's body too.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.252
Did my story check out?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.672
Yeah, it did.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.341
So am I under arrest now?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.635
You damn sure should be.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.722
Apparently the sheriff there
is willing to forgive and forget...

08:35.890 --> 08:38.058
...as long as you'll bring
that ambulance back.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.145
Nobody wants to press any charges.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.607
Well, you gotta love small towns.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.694
Why would you go to all that trouble,
just walk in here and confess it to me?

08:48.862 --> 08:52.072
I'm here because I can't live
with what I know anymore.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.078
What exactly do you know?

09:00.582 --> 09:03.042
That is your mother, isn't it?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.502
-Yeah, it is.
-I knew it.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.672
You got the same eyes.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.591
Why don't we get back to your story?

09:12.427 --> 09:15.679
What makes you think that your brother
is the God's Hand killer?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.932
I know it was him.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.434
How do you know?

09:20.936 --> 09:24.063
He started back in Thurman.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.777
It was near the summer of 1979.

09:59.975 --> 10:04.353
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
Down in my heart

10:04.521 --> 10:08.691
-You're supposed to say "where?"
-I don't wanna sing that dumb song.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.943
You don't have to sing it.
Just say "where?"

10:11.111 --> 10:12.611
All right. Where?

10:12.779 --> 10:15.489
Not now.
I'll point to you when it's time.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.826
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
Down in my heart

10:18.994 --> 10:20.953
-Where?
-Down in my heart

10:21.121 --> 10:22.997
-Where?
-Down in my heart

10:23.164 --> 10:27.418
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
Down in my heart to stay

10:28.753 --> 10:31.672
And if the devil doesn't like it
He can sit on a tack

10:32.507 --> 10:34.008
Sit on a tack

10:34.175 --> 10:35.342
Sit on a tack

10:35.510 --> 10:40.347
And if the devil doesn't like it
He can sit on a tack to stay

10:40.515 --> 10:42.641
So who was that chick that--?
Who threw up?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.728
Oh, that was Katie Hagen.
She is sure pretty, though.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.023
-That was real nasty, though.
-Oh, yeah.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.776
All over the floor.
And when the principal fell?

10:54.696 --> 10:55.696
I got the joy, joy....

10:55.864 --> 10:59.033
We lived right behind
the Thurman public rose garden...

10:59.200 --> 11:02.828
...in the house where they used to
keep the gardeners back in the '50s.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.790
Dad had gotten a good deal on it
back when he and Mom got married.

11:08.293 --> 11:12.880
The unexpected incident that creates
those dangerous moments.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.341
The ropes were suddenly
off the alligator.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.552
Adam was 3 years younger
than me.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.055
Our mom had died giving birth to him...

11:21.222 --> 11:24.683
...so I basically took care of him
ever since I can remember.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.563
Our dad worked as a mechanic
over in Jupiter.

11:29.731 --> 11:33.192
He usually got home around 5:30
and we'd all have dinner together.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.027
--escape behavior of gators.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.154
-Hey, kiddos.
-Hey, Dad.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.947
Something sure smells good.

11:39.115 --> 11:44.203
The next job was to get a rope
over his mouth to tie up....

11:45.914 --> 11:48.540
-How was your day?
-It was all right.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.376
Let's eat.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.172
Whoa, there, tiger. Save some for us.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.841
-I sure love peas.
-You must.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.428
You better be careful, though.
You just might turn into one.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.848
Say, how'd you do on that math test?

12:05.016 --> 12:06.975
Barely passed.

12:07.143 --> 12:11.355
Well, I was never any good
at math either.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.732
I still can't do anything
without a calculator.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.151
Yeah, but there's gonna be
another test next week.

12:16.319 --> 12:20.155
-That one's gonna be even harder.
-Hey, don't sound so glum.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.535
Tell you what.
We'll sit down this weekend...

12:24.702 --> 12:27.287
...see if we can't figure
out that junk together, okay?

12:27.455 --> 12:29.331
All right.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.586
Hey, Fenton, can we go see
Meatballs after school tomorrow?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.755
We've already seen it.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.424
I wanna see it again.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.093
No, we're gonna go see The Warriors.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.763
-Can't. It's rated R.
-We'll sneak in.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.974
Teeth all brushed?

12:47.976 --> 12:49.268
You sure about that, Adam?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.520
All right, breath-test time.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.607
Dad, I did brush them.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.943
I'm just yolking with you, egghead.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.113
Don't worry, Fenton. I know
you're too big for a good-night kiss.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.576
-Good night, boys. Sleep tight.
-Don't let those bedbugs bite.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.202
That's right.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.496
-Love you guys.
-Love you too, Dad.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.914
Night, Dad.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.833
Good night, Curtis.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.005
-I wanna see Meatballs again.
-Fine.

13:18.173 --> 13:22.468
You can see Meatballs
and I'll see The Warriors.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.012
But I don't like to watch movies
by myself.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.222
Too bad.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.141
Please?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.643
Fine.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.854
Fine. Just go to bed.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.862
And that was our family.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.156
Just the three of us.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.408
All of Mom and Dad's relatives
had died off...

13:46.576 --> 13:48.869
...so there was no one left but us.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.370
We didn't mind, though.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.582
We didn't need anybody else.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.709
We were happy together.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.461
Until....

13:58.338 --> 13:59.963
-Fenton, wake up.
-Dad?

14:00.131 --> 14:02.299
-I've got something to tell you.
-What's wrong?

14:02.467 --> 14:03.884
It's okay.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.303
Adam, wake up and listen.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.681
I need you both to listen to me
very carefully.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.934
Something's happened.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.272
He said he'd had a vision that night.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.108
A vision from God.

14:45.927 --> 14:50.180
An angel came to him
and told him the truth of this world...

14:50.723 --> 14:55.269
...and revealed God's special purpose
for our family.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.564
The end of the world is coming.
It's near.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.857
The angel showed me.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.944
There are demons among us.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.780
The devil has released them
for the final battle.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.950
It's being fought right now.

15:10.118 --> 15:14.580
But nobody knows it except us
and others like us.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.957
I'm scared, Dad.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.418
There's nothing to be afraid of, tiger.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.796
We've been chosen by God.
He will protect us.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.924
He's given us special jobs to do.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.304
We don't fear these demons.
We destroy them.

15:30.471 --> 15:34.308
We pick them up one by one
and we pitch them out of this world.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.811
That's God's purpose for us.

15:37.979 --> 15:42.190
-The angel called us God's hands.
-So we're like superheroes?

15:42.358 --> 15:43.734
That's right.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.154
We're a family of superheroes
that are gonna help save the world.

15:47.322 --> 15:51.116
But, Dad, that doesn't make any sense.

15:51.659 --> 15:55.245
I know it sounds that way, son,
but it's the truth.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.956
So, what are our superpowers?

15:58.499 --> 16:00.042
Well....

16:01.336 --> 16:04.171
We can see the demons
while other people can't.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.506
And the angel told me...

16:06.674 --> 16:09.801
...that God would be sending us
three weapons to destroy them with.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.179
Magical weapons?

16:13.014 --> 16:15.057
I imagine so.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.184
When do we get them?

16:17.352 --> 16:19.895
I don't know. The angel just said soon.

16:20.897 --> 16:25.192
That's all I was told, except that we're not
supposed to tell anybody about any of this.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.860
Absolutely no one.

16:27.028 --> 16:30.947
If we do, we put them and ourselves
in danger.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.243
Fenton...

16:35.703 --> 16:37.788
...don't worry, it's okay.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.415
It's a lot to understand.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.503
I wanted to wait to tell you till I had
the chance to figure it out myself...

16:44.671 --> 16:48.006
...but the angel said I had to do it now.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.342
Fenton?

16:51.719 --> 16:54.554
I didn't know what to say or how to feel.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.890
Do you understand what I told you?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.142
Judgment Day's here.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.562
It was too messed up to understand
or even acknowledge.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.940
Soon we'll all be in heaven.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.233
You, me, Adam, with Mommy.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.319
I didn't realize it at that moment,
at least not consciously--

17:10.488 --> 17:11.738
She's waiting in heaven.

17:11.906 --> 17:15.659
--but my happy and mostly secure world
had just been flipped over...

17:15.827 --> 17:17.536
...and there were dark things there.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.288
-Judgment Day is here.
-Very dark things.

17:20.455 --> 17:21.748
We've been chosen by God.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.042
And my little boy's mind
just couldn't take it.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.845
Adam! Fenton!

17:37.390 --> 17:39.850
Up and at them, boys!

17:49.110 --> 17:50.193
Morning, kiddo.

17:50.361 --> 17:53.572
Hey, come on, lazybones.
It's late. We overslept.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.953
Well, let's go. Snap to it and get dressed.
I gotta get to work.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.122
Drop you guys off on the way.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.208
What's wrong with you?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.630
Nothing.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.733
Hey, let me have a bite of that.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.528
None of us mentioned it.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.615
It was only a dream, a nightmare.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.162
Nothing that crazy could be real.

18:42.497 --> 18:45.707
Everything was okay, just like before.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.715
Well, have a good day at school, boys.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.092
And remember not to tell anyone
what I told you.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.512
We won't, Dad. Bye.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.233
I want you all
to copy down this sentence.

19:11.400 --> 19:16.196
We're gonna go through the structure.
The girl in...

19:16.364 --> 19:18.698
...the blue dress....

19:20.451 --> 19:22.994
I refused to believe it.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.665
That whole next week
was just a dream too.

19:28.042 --> 19:31.753
--her brown dog.

19:31.921 --> 19:36.383
Like when Dad started bringing home
the magical weapons.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.345
He was on his way to work...

19:41.138 --> 19:43.598
...when God called to him.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.187
Hold this. Be careful.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.443
I still can't understand
what these gloves are for, though.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.117
Just a long, long dream.

20:44.285 --> 20:48.121
I want you to all write this down
at the top of your pages in big letters.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.165
How about that spot over there?

20:50.333 --> 20:53.043
Boys! Boys, look at this.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.669
--come on, hurry up.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.339
-Be careful.
-And stay where I can see you, dear.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.467
-Let's go over here.
-You bring the basket.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.594
We've got them all.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.971
It won't be long now.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.641
The angel came again last night
and told me...

21:07.808 --> 21:10.977
...that God'll be sending
us a list of the first seven demons soon.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.189
It wasn't real. It couldn't be.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.816
I just had to wait it out.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.532
-Come over here a minute, Fenton.
-I'm washing dishes.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.660
They can wait.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.662
Come here, I wanna talk to you.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.678
Well, I know you've had some trouble...

21:44.845 --> 21:48.890
...adjusting to everything
that's happened this week, and I'm sorry...

21:49.058 --> 21:52.811
...but God has willed this
and we must obey God.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.231
Maybe you just dreamed it.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.483
I didn't dream it.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.778
I wouldn't make up
something like that, son.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.240
Maybe....

22:08.411 --> 22:11.913
Maybe you're not right in the head.

22:12.081 --> 22:15.291
It happened, Fenton. It's true.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.752
You'll see that soon.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.463
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.216
I got the first list.

22:25.803 --> 22:28.179
The angel came to him
while he was at work.

23:16.937 --> 23:21.399
Joe to first window.
Joe to first window.

23:41.337 --> 23:45.006
Dad, these are people's names.

23:45.174 --> 23:50.678
That's right, and they'll look
like people too, but they're not.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.934
The angel said
when I lay my hands on them...

23:56.102 --> 23:58.645
...I'll reveal them for what they truly are.

23:58.813 --> 24:00.563
That's what the gloves are for.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.358
I get them and bring them back here
with the gloves on...

24:03.526 --> 24:07.112
...and once they're back here,
I take the gloves off and reveal them.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.990
You'll see. Then you'll believe.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.867
Anyone know what this word means?
You remember what this word means?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.994
Anyone know what this word means?
You remember what this word means?

24:15.162 --> 24:17.497
The dream had finally ended.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.082
It was all real.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.797
And I had to stop him.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.802
The obvious answer was
to tell someone what he was planning...

24:30.970 --> 24:32.512
...but I couldn't do that.

24:33.848 --> 24:36.683
I loved him, even if he had gone crazy.

24:36.851 --> 24:39.102
Dad, look. I got a list too.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.480
Where did you get this, Adam?

24:42.648 --> 24:44.107
God gave it to me.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.613
Isn't Travis Shed that boy that was
picking on you at school?

24:51.198 --> 24:52.198
He's a demon.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.618
Tell the truth, Adam.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.912
You made this list up yourself,
didn't you?

24:58.080 --> 25:00.665
-No, God did.
-Adam.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.210
Come on. Right here.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.505
Listen to me, son.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.175
You can't just make stuff like that up.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.719
We destroy demons.
If we were to use your list...

25:12.887 --> 25:16.097
...we wouldn't be destroying demons,
we'd be killing people.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.308
And we can never do that.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.393
Now, destroying demons
is a good thing.

25:20.561 --> 25:23.730
Killing people is bad. You understand?

25:23.898 --> 25:26.191
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-That's all right.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.734
It's okay.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.903
You just gotta have a little patience.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.070
Don't worry.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.740
God will send you your own list
when you're older.

25:33.908 --> 25:36.492
Okay, go do some homework.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.589
The only thing left to do was to tell.

25:55.012 --> 25:57.764
But that was easier said than done.

26:14.114 --> 26:17.867
Dad had promised to take us
to the movies that night.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.163
But he didn't come home from work.

26:23.457 --> 26:26.668
-When's Dad coming home?
-I don't know.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.672
Think he's destroying a demon?

26:30.839 --> 26:33.383
-It's all make-believe, Adam.
-No, it's not. It's true.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.386
Listen to me.
None of that demon junk is real.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.389
Daddy-- He just made it up.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.975
-No, he didn't.
-He did too.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.310
Just like Santa Claus.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.895
You remember last Christmas...

26:46.063 --> 26:49.148
...when you caught Dad putting
presents under the tree, don't you?

26:49.984 --> 26:51.859
It's just like that.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.363
Adam, have I ever lied to you?

26:56.824 --> 26:59.742
All right, look.
Dad made up this whole thing.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.787
Those names on Dad's list
are real people.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.165
-Do you understand?
-But why would he make it up?

27:06.333 --> 27:07.792
I don't know.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.045
I think we should leave.

27:11.255 --> 27:14.382
You mean run away?

27:14.550 --> 27:17.719
Will you go with me?
Only for a little while.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.764
-I don't wanna leave Dad.
-Neither do I.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.642
But we might have to.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.519
Why?

27:31.191 --> 27:33.192
Dad's gonna kill somebody.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.760
Son, come over here.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.597
Come on. I need your help.

29:08.622 --> 29:10.164
Dad?

29:10.332 --> 29:12.375
Come on out here, Adam.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.091
Shine that light over here.

29:22.636 --> 29:25.012
Hey, Dad, who is that?

29:25.180 --> 29:27.807
That's a demon, son.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.187
Come on in here, boys. It's all right.

29:33.647 --> 29:36.357
Go on. Don't be afraid.

29:55.586 --> 29:59.881
God came to him earlier that day
and told him that the time had come.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.844
After work, he drove down
to Jacksonville...

30:05.012 --> 30:08.014
...about 45 minutes or so
southwest of Thurman.

30:08.015 --> 30:08.514
...about 45 minutes or so
southwest of Thurman.

30:09.349 --> 30:13.352
He said he'd never been there before,
but he had no problem finding it.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.771
God was leading him.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.387
-Cynthia Harbridge?
-Yes?

31:00.817 --> 31:02.318
Dad, don't. Please don't.

31:02.486 --> 31:07.240
Fenton, if I could spare you this, I would.

31:08.408 --> 31:12.870
But we are God's servants
and his will must be served.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.376
Don't be afraid, son.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.734
Is that true?

31:44.695 --> 31:46.404
Why would I make it up?

31:47.906 --> 31:49.615
Where's your father now?

31:51.326 --> 31:52.868
Dead.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.081
Sir, I was just thinking
about heading out.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.292
Unless you need me to stay.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.252
No.

32:02.129 --> 32:04.255
That's all right. You go ahead.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.798
Well, have a good night, sir.

32:15.475 --> 32:18.352
So he killed that woman
right there in front of you?

32:18.520 --> 32:21.314
Yeah, but not to his way of thinking.

32:22.316 --> 32:26.485
You see, to him, he hadn't killed a woman,
he had destroyed a demon.

32:28.155 --> 32:32.992
He believed that when he laid
his hands on her, it revealed her sins.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.593
Dad, don't! Please!

34:19.641 --> 34:21.266
No, Adam.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.148
Do it like this.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.944
Gotta be done a certain way.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.946
The angel was real specific.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.614
Why out here in the rose garden?

34:37.284 --> 34:41.661
God chose it,
just like he chose us, I suppose.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.460
Don't cry for her, Fenton.
She wasn't human.

34:49.463 --> 34:52.255
Didn't you see that
when I touched her?

34:52.424 --> 34:54.300
I saw it, Dad.

34:58.013 --> 35:01.056
You killed her.

35:01.558 --> 35:06.103
I didn't kill her, son.
I destroyed her. She was a demon.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.358
You know, I wasn't so sure
I could do it myself.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.320
I mean,
she looked like a woman to me too.

35:14.488 --> 35:19.909
But after I touched her,
all I could see was the evil.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.077
And I had to do it.

35:23.497 --> 35:26.457
I'm sorry you didn't see it too.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.584
You will next time.

35:28.752 --> 35:31.670
You're gonna do it again?

35:33.340 --> 35:35.257
This is our job now, son.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.510
You've got to accept that.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.678
I won't let you.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.223
You can't stop it.
We are doing God's work.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.933
I'll tell.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.020
If you do, someone will die.
The angel was clear on that.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.271
Do you understand?

35:50.690 --> 35:53.859
Answer me, Fenton.
Do you understand?

35:57.197 --> 35:59.365
So you didn't tell?

36:00.116 --> 36:02.493
No. I should've, but I was afraid.

36:03.537 --> 36:06.205
I mean, I loved my father,
but I was terrified of him.

36:07.707 --> 36:11.377
So now you understand why I know
my brother is the God's Hand killer?

36:11.920 --> 36:14.672
Have you got any physical proof?

36:15.465 --> 36:17.424
I read in the paper...

36:17.968 --> 36:20.970
...that only one of the bodies
of the six victims had been found.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.221
Now, is that true?

36:23.265 --> 36:25.140
You read it in the paper, didn't you?

36:25.308 --> 36:29.436
-Doesn't necessarily mean it's true.
-Well, in this case it does.

36:29.604 --> 36:33.440
See, the first victim
was found mutilated...

36:33.608 --> 36:37.403
...with a note saying
that God's hand had taken him.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.823
But all the rest, only notes were found.
No bodies.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.909
-How do you know they're dead?
-Well, we don't for sure.

36:44.578 --> 36:48.998
But the first note told us we wouldn't
find any more bodies from then on.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.250
Said...

36:51.418 --> 36:53.586
...he wanted to keep them.

36:55.005 --> 36:58.382
I got a pretty good idea
where the rest of them bodies are.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.010
The rose garden.

37:03.930 --> 37:07.099
Now, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place?

37:07.267 --> 37:08.726
Would you have believed me?

37:11.104 --> 37:12.605
Come on.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.122
Here.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.293
What's this?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.795
Put them on.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.923
Or I'll put them on for you.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.518
Let's go.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.577
I got it.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.769
So tell me something.

38:34.521 --> 38:37.022
Why didn't you come see me sooner?

38:38.274 --> 38:41.735
You wanna get on I-30 east up here.

38:43.822 --> 38:47.449
I just can't imagine how you can keep
something like that inside for so long.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.536
I guess I avoided it.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.372
Because I wanted to.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.464
You know,
you never did tell me why it is...

39:02.632 --> 39:05.801
...you keep just that one picture
of your mother in your office.

39:11.683 --> 39:16.061
My mother was murdered a couple
of days after that picture was taken.

39:17.981 --> 39:21.900
Butchered by some whacked-out killer
like your dad.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.904
Did they ever catch him?

39:27.407 --> 39:29.158
No.

39:29.743 --> 39:32.369
Is that why you took this job?

39:33.747 --> 39:37.207
You know, you're pretty good at this.
You ever think about becoming a cop?

39:39.794 --> 39:42.212
Well, you know, when I was a kid.

39:43.423 --> 39:46.216
Well, you got the instincts for it.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.094
A cop's gotta have good instincts.

39:49.262 --> 39:52.181
You know what mine
are telling me now?

39:53.767 --> 39:56.101
You are hiding something from me.

39:57.687 --> 40:00.272
What is it do you think I'm hiding?

40:01.441 --> 40:04.902
Well, why don't you just keep talking?
Maybe I'll figure that out.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.829
You okay, Dad?

40:16.623 --> 40:20.751
I'm all right, son. Here I come.

40:23.797 --> 40:26.673
Dad, why did God let this
happen to me?

40:26.841 --> 40:29.551
Don't blame God, Davy.
It wasn't his fault.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.261
God let me do it.

40:31.429 --> 40:35.057
What God lets you do
is decide for yourself what you will do.

40:35.809 --> 40:38.018
You're not a puppet
with strings tied to you.

40:38.186 --> 40:39.478
No.

40:39.646 --> 40:42.147
So God doesn't make you
do anything.

40:42.315 --> 40:45.192
He wants you to decide for yourself.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.238
After that night,
nothing much happened.

40:49.405 --> 40:53.325
Dad didn't mention it any more.
Neither did Adam.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.577
Once a full month had gone by...

40:55.745 --> 40:58.247
...I'd completely convinced myself
that it was over...

40:58.414 --> 41:00.749
...and everything was gonna be all right.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.335
-Bye.
-See y'all later.

41:03.503 --> 41:06.046
-See you.
-You see Dukes of Hazzard last night?

41:06.214 --> 41:07.840
Remember when Daisy Duke
bent over?

41:08.007 --> 41:10.717
I like Boss Hogg. He's funny.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.263
Man, I'd do anything
to really see her tits.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.974
-Oh, you said tits--
-Shut up, Adam.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.935
You wanna spend the night tonight?
We can wrap Corey's house.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.854
Sure, but I'm gonna have
to ask my dad.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.939
Well, my mom can call
and ask if you want.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.816
-Sure.
-I'll see you in a little bit.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.694
-Bye.
-Hey, what's "wrap" mean?

41:29.362 --> 41:31.321
Tell you later. Come on, I'll race you.

41:47.881 --> 41:49.173
Come on.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.759
No, I'm gonna go around on the road.

42:18.912 --> 42:21.622
-Dad?
-In here.

42:23.833 --> 42:26.168
-Whose van is that out there?
-Ours.

42:26.336 --> 42:28.378
Ain't she a beaut?

42:30.215 --> 42:34.051
Your friend's mom just called.
I told her not tonight.

42:34.719 --> 42:37.429
We got some work to do
in the morning.

42:51.194 --> 42:53.820
Dad told us that there were moments
in everyone's life...

42:53.988 --> 42:55.447
...when they could disappear...

42:55.615 --> 42:58.158
...without anyone knowing
where they went or why.

42:58.326 --> 42:59.868
He said those were the moments...

43:00.036 --> 43:03.121
...when God's hands
could reach out and take you.

43:03.289 --> 43:07.084
According to Dad, nothing,
not even a camera, could catch us.

43:07.252 --> 43:10.462
We were invisible
when we were God's hands.

43:10.630 --> 43:13.423
-What do we do now, Dad?
-We wait.

43:13.591 --> 43:16.969
We'll get him when he comes out,
just like I told you, remember?

43:17.136 --> 43:18.971
Fenton?

43:19.138 --> 43:20.931
I can't do this, Dad.

43:21.099 --> 43:23.976
-"Can't" never could do anything.
-I can do it, Dad.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.311
You sure can, tiger.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.315
-Well, what if someone sees us?
-They won't.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.025
It's broad daylight.

43:32.193 --> 43:35.153
I told you. God will blind them for us.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.194
There he is, boys.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.406
-Come on, Fenton.
-Dad, I can't.

44:19.574 --> 44:22.034
Yes, you can. Now, move.

44:22.201 --> 44:24.036
Do what I tell you.

44:31.210 --> 44:33.045
Please, Trixie.

44:33.212 --> 44:35.964
Trixie, come on. Come, Trixie.

44:36.132 --> 44:38.884
-Trixie, come on.
-What are you doing, boy?

44:39.052 --> 44:42.220
My dog. She-- She's under your car.

44:43.264 --> 44:45.057
Well, let's see.

44:51.147 --> 44:53.357
Help me grab his legs.

44:53.941 --> 44:56.068
Help me grab his legs. Now!

44:56.235 --> 44:57.903
Come on!

45:02.367 --> 45:04.159
Edward March?

45:05.828 --> 45:08.163
You think that's an innocent man
there, don't you?

45:08.331 --> 45:10.332
Well, it's not.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.861
You didn't think anyone knew
about that, did you?

45:40.029 --> 45:41.405
But God saw you.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.615
-Dad, don't. Please.
-Quiet.

45:44.867 --> 45:47.786
And you can't escape God's wrath.

46:06.973 --> 46:09.808
Can't believe you still didn't see it.

46:09.976 --> 46:12.769
He was a murderer
of little children, Fenton.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.771
Babies.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.986
Babies.

46:30.705 --> 46:32.581
He's the murderer.

46:32.748 --> 46:34.416
We've gotta get out of here, Adam.

46:34.584 --> 46:37.878
-What do you mean?
-We've gotta run away.

46:38.838 --> 46:40.505
Told you we might have to.

46:40.673 --> 46:42.507
I don't wanna run away.

46:45.678 --> 46:46.928
We have to.

46:47.096 --> 46:48.597
Why?

46:49.849 --> 46:51.850
Listen to me, Adam.

46:52.018 --> 46:55.020
-Dad kills people.
-No, he doesn't.

46:55.188 --> 46:56.271
He's a demon slayer.

46:56.439 --> 46:58.523
That's all lies, Adam.

46:58.691 --> 47:01.193
No, it's not.
I see it when he touches them.

47:01.360 --> 47:06.072
No, you don't. Dad's brainwashed you.
It's all a big lie.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.658
He's a murderer and you help him.

47:09.410 --> 47:12.704
We're just serving God's will.
I'm telling Dad on you.

47:12.872 --> 47:15.707
Adam-- Adam! Adam!

47:40.066 --> 47:42.275
Get up and get dressed.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.694
And don't wake your brother.

47:57.250 --> 47:59.084
Sit down.

48:05.424 --> 48:07.509
Your brother told me
what you said last night.

48:11.681 --> 48:14.766
I want you to know I've never
killed anything in my whole life.

48:14.934 --> 48:17.602
That's a lie and you know it.

48:22.149 --> 48:25.610
I did a lot of thinking and praying
after you went to bed.

48:27.613 --> 48:30.282
I asked the angel to visit you.

48:31.409 --> 48:33.785
But instead he visited me.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.539
He told me something...

48:38.791 --> 48:40.959
...that I don't wanna believe.

48:43.629 --> 48:44.963
What?

48:47.300 --> 48:49.092
It doesn't matter.

48:49.260 --> 48:52.554
Because together you and I
are gonna prove him wrong.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.933
You just don't have any faith.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.769
That's why you can't see the truth.

49:01.814 --> 49:04.149
But we're gonna change that.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.418
I want you to dig a hole right here.

49:23.586 --> 49:30.008
Need to be about 10 feet deep
and 15 feet wide on both sides.

49:30.176 --> 49:34.220
The length and the width
should form a perfect square.

49:35.181 --> 49:38.266
-What?
-You heard me.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.603
Why?

49:41.771 --> 49:44.272
Because I'm your father
and you'll do what I tell you.

49:44.440 --> 49:45.940
You understand?

49:46.817 --> 49:48.401
Do you?

49:48.778 --> 49:51.529
-Yes, sir.
-All right, then.

49:51.697 --> 49:54.949
I expect half that to be dug by
the time I get home from work tonight.

49:55.117 --> 49:58.161
-Dad, I can't do that.
-Pray.

50:16.681 --> 50:20.308
I started digging that goddamn hole,
but I did not pray.

50:20.476 --> 50:21.893
I would not.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.063
I hated God. I despised him.

50:25.731 --> 50:29.818
My hatred helped me dig,
kept me going.

50:30.528 --> 50:33.238
Dad's or God's or the angel's
or whoever's plan it was...

50:33.406 --> 50:34.572
...would not work on me.

50:34.740 --> 50:35.740
Hey, Fenton.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.659
I knew what Dad was doing
was wrong...

50:37.827 --> 50:40.245
...and nothing was gonna change that.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.247
Fenton?

50:44.709 --> 50:46.918
I'm sorry I told on you.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.636
You didn't tell him what I said
about running away, did you?

50:56.804 --> 50:58.888
-No.
-Will you go with me, then?

50:59.056 --> 51:01.599
-There's no reason to go.
-He's a killer.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.435
No, he's not.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.438
I've been praying for you.

51:06.605 --> 51:09.274
-Have you been praying?
-Nope, and I'm not going to.

51:09.442 --> 51:12.193
-But Dad said--
-I don't care what Dad said.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.696
He might be able to make me
dig this stupid hole...

51:14.864 --> 51:17.115
...but he can't make me pray.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.577
Just get out of here and leave me alone.

51:21.120 --> 51:23.121
I'll help if you promise
you won't tell Dad.

51:23.289 --> 51:24.372
I don't want your help.

51:24.540 --> 51:27.125
-There's another shovel in the shed.
-Get out of here.

51:27.293 --> 51:29.294
Butthole.

51:32.298 --> 51:34.466
I wanted to run away, far away...

51:34.633 --> 51:36.384
...but I still couldn't leave Adam...

51:36.552 --> 51:39.429
...no matter how crazy
Dad was turning him.

51:39.597 --> 51:43.641
Besides, there was nowhere to go.

52:03.788 --> 52:07.540
All right, this time you are not....

52:08.501 --> 52:11.044
This time, I'll make your lane.

52:11.212 --> 52:14.631
All right, 21, 36....

52:19.845 --> 52:22.847
-Finally gave up, huh, kiddo?
-I didn't give up.

52:23.015 --> 52:25.683
-I'll be out there again in the morning.
-Hey, come on.

52:25.851 --> 52:27.352
I didn't mean it like that.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.354
I don't wanna fight with you, son.

52:30.356 --> 52:34.818
I'm not doing this to hurt you.
Wish you could understand that.

52:38.948 --> 52:41.115
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

52:41.283 --> 52:43.034
-Let me see your hands.
-They're fine.

52:43.202 --> 52:44.869
Let me see them.

52:45.579 --> 52:49.999
-Didn't you wear gloves today?
-I didn't need them. I'm fine.

52:57.007 --> 52:58.424
Here.

52:59.343 --> 53:01.344
Help ease the pain.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.722
I said I was fine.

53:04.890 --> 53:08.977
I know you're mad, but that's no reason to
cause yourself pain. Now, you take those.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.898
I got an extra pair of work gloves
in the shed.

53:14.066 --> 53:16.484
I want you to use those from now on.

53:17.403 --> 53:20.238
Won't do you any good
now that you've wrecked your hands...

53:20.406 --> 53:22.740
...but a couple of days, you'll be fine.

53:25.452 --> 53:27.453
I want you to know I'm proud of you.

53:27.621 --> 53:30.081
And I know God's proud of you too.

53:32.459 --> 53:35.086
Take some time off
and let those blisters callous over.

53:35.254 --> 53:37.714
Then you can get back to it, all right?

53:43.762 --> 53:45.597
Well, good night, then.

53:46.765 --> 53:48.391
Come on, tiger. Bedtime.

53:48.559 --> 53:52.228
But Fenton gets to stay up.
Please, Dad?

53:52.396 --> 53:54.063
Come on.

53:55.983 --> 53:58.818
Brush your teeth.
I'll be in to say good night.

54:05.784 --> 54:07.952
I kept digging.

54:08.120 --> 54:11.080
My hands bled, but I wouldn't stop.

54:17.838 --> 54:22.091
I kept at it morning, noon,
and night for 5 days.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.928
And by the sixth day,
that hole was as dark and deep...

54:25.095 --> 54:27.805
...as my hatred for Dad's God.

54:28.641 --> 54:31.476
Well, you finished it, all right.

54:32.478 --> 54:35.772
Bet you didn't pray once
the whole time, did you?

54:35.940 --> 54:37.398
Nope.

54:43.322 --> 54:45.907
We started the cellar after that.

54:46.533 --> 54:49.160
At least, that's what Dad called it.

54:49.328 --> 54:51.329
But I knew better.

54:52.581 --> 54:55.416
We were building a dungeon
down there.

54:57.336 --> 55:00.421
We basically built a big wooden box
in the ground.

55:00.589 --> 55:02.674
Good, boys. Get it over there.
Cover it good.

55:02.841 --> 55:05.510
-But Dad said it would hold.
-Okay, ready? All right, good.

55:05.678 --> 55:07.845
He said God would see to it.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.765
Adam, get back here! Help me push!

55:11.684 --> 55:13.685
Come on, keep it going. Push it.

55:13.852 --> 55:17.689
Go! Go, Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!

55:29.034 --> 55:30.827
You boys did good.

55:30.995 --> 55:35.540
-Especially you, Fenton.
-No. I just did as I was told.

55:47.803 --> 55:50.138
Let's give this a try. What do you think?

55:50.305 --> 55:52.056
All right.

55:55.019 --> 55:57.311
The next night,
he brought home another demon.

56:02.901 --> 56:04.986
Get down here.

56:12.411 --> 56:15.621
It has to be done. It's God's will.

56:15.998 --> 56:18.583
Come on, do it like I showed you.
The neck first.

56:32.347 --> 56:33.514
Fenton!

56:33.682 --> 56:35.016
Fenton, get back here!

56:35.184 --> 56:36.809
Boy!

56:37.561 --> 56:39.103
Fenton!

56:47.071 --> 56:49.781
I half expected angels
or even God himself...

56:49.948 --> 56:52.492
...to come out of the night and stop me.

56:52.659 --> 56:55.244
But I had to do it.

56:55.412 --> 56:57.371
It had to end.

57:09.343 --> 57:11.135
-Hello?
-10-34 to any and all units...

57:11.303 --> 57:12.637
...in the vicinity of Garden.

57:12.805 --> 57:16.724
We have complaints of a 501 driving
on the alternate side of the street.

57:21.730 --> 57:25.149
Hello? Hello?

57:29.154 --> 57:31.155
Well, take it easy, boy.

57:31.323 --> 57:33.491
Don't break my door down.

57:33.659 --> 57:35.326
Well, what's your problem?

57:36.829 --> 57:39.163
Craziest thing I've heard in a long time.

57:39.331 --> 57:41.082
-What are you doing?
-Calling your dad.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.333
-You can't.
-Yes, I can.

57:42.501 --> 57:44.252
Ought to be ashamed,
making up stories.

57:44.419 --> 57:47.171
But it's true. I can show you.

57:51.927 --> 57:54.679
Come on. Let's go.

58:08.193 --> 58:10.194
All right.
It's around back, under the shed.

58:10.362 --> 58:12.530
That's enough of that now, boy.

58:12.698 --> 58:14.699
-Put an end to this. Come on.
-No, no, no.

58:14.867 --> 58:17.034
I don't think you understand.
He's around back.

58:17.202 --> 58:20.371
Let's see what your dad's
got to say about all this.

58:28.505 --> 58:29.881
What's the trouble, sheriff?

58:32.384 --> 58:35.219
Sorry to wake you, but your boy here
seems to have a problem.

58:40.225 --> 58:42.143
Well, come on in.

58:53.655 --> 58:56.115
I was about to lock up,
head over to Lake Thompson.

58:56.283 --> 58:59.076
You know, get a jump on those bass.

58:59.244 --> 59:02.538
And he comes running in
with this wild story.

59:02.706 --> 59:04.498
Yep, it's quite a tale, all right.

59:04.666 --> 59:06.876
It's the truth and you know it.

59:08.921 --> 59:13.758
Makes me crazy to think that he
told everyone down at your office too.

59:13.926 --> 59:16.093
Well, you can set your mind at ease
about that.

59:16.261 --> 59:17.970
I was the only one there.

59:18.138 --> 59:20.765
Of course, I don't believe a word of it.

59:21.433 --> 59:25.853
What does get me, though, is why
would he make up such a crazy story?

59:28.732 --> 59:31.234
I don't know why he made it up.

59:32.778 --> 59:37.365
Probably did it to get back at me
for punishing him earlier.

59:37.616 --> 59:40.618
-Did you tell him about that?
-He's lying.

59:40.786 --> 59:42.787
Just check the shed.

59:44.539 --> 59:46.958
I don't know what to do with him.

59:47.125 --> 59:51.587
Well, they hit puberty,
seem to lose all respect for you.

59:51.880 --> 59:54.757
Me and my boy survived it. You will too.

59:54.925 --> 59:59.845
Just check the shed or the rose garden.
I could show you where they're buried.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:03.391
Boy, why don't you just quit
all this nonsense?

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:05.768
Please, I can show you.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:15.736
Maybe we ought to check
the shed just to quiet him down.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:19.699
Well, if it has to be done,
it has to be done.

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:22.326
What do you think, kiddo?

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.998
Does it have to be done?

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:44.682
See?

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:48.352
Figured we ought to have a storm cellar.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.812
Go on down, check it out.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.232
Just watch your step.
I'm not much of a carpenter.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.763
I don't see a thing.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.474
He was here.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:27.975
Boy?

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:32.021
You realize how much trouble you
could get into over a thing like this?

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:35.232
They must've moved him
because he was here.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:39.487
Adam. Adam's got him somewhere.
I know it.

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:43.240
-I think I've seen enough.
-But--

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:46.202
I can show you where
the bodies are buried.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.712
Please. You've gotta believe me.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.745
May God welcome you...

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.873
...and keep you.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:54.979
I never killed a man before tonight.

01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:56.730
I've seen you kill plenty.

01:02:57.983 --> 01:02:59.400
Those were demons.

01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:02.319
That was a man.
Why can't you see that?

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:03.779
You didn't have to kill him.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:07.741
-I had to protect our mission.
-There is no mission.

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:10.327
That man is dead because of you.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.621
You see him? Look at him.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.666
Dead because you have no faith.

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:17.668
Do you understand
what you made me do?

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:20.796
-You made me commit murder.
-I didn't make you do anything.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.756
You did. You're crazy.

01:03:24.593 --> 01:03:27.511
Dad, no! Dad, don't!

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:41.108
It's all right, Dad. Don't cry.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.760
Wait a minute, Fenton.

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:09.887
Go on inside, son.

01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:12.223
I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.974
Go on. It's all right.

01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:15.559
Go.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.442
Come into the shed.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.669
Come in and shut the door.

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:53.222
Are you afraid?

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:56.684
-Of what?
-You.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.729
Only demons should fear me.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.732
And you're not a demon, are you?

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.111
The angel said you were.

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:13.784
But I can't believe that. I won't.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:21.750
You're my son,
and I love you more than my own life.

01:05:24.296 --> 01:05:27.214
You know what's funny
about all this, Fenton?

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.719
I'm afraid of you.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.493
Go on.

01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:59.663
-But, Dad--
-Go on, get down there.

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:02.374
I don't wanna do this, Fenton,
but I have to.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:06.670
I had to kill a man tonight.
I can't let that happen again.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:10.799
-But, Dad, I promise I won't tell.
-I can't trust you.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.718
I wish I could.

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:13.969
Now, go on.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.513
But, Dad, I'm sorry.

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:22.019
I'm sorry too, Fenton,
but this has to be done.

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:25.773
Now, you get on down there
or I'll put you down there myself.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.900
-But, Dad--
-Go!

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.235
No--

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:33.906
No. No.

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:36.075
No.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.953
Dad, please. Dad. Dad, no.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:41.538
Please.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.207
No. Please, Dad.

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:45.459
You'll stay down here
until you see the truth.

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:47.711
Please, Dad. No. Please.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.672
-Pray to God, Fenton.
-Please, Dad, no.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.298
-Pray for a vision.
-Please. No.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:53.550
-Only he can help you now.
-No!

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:58.055
Please don't do this, Dad. No, please.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.057
Please, it's me, Fenton.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:03.018
Please don't do this!

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:08.732
It's me, Fenton.
I'm not a demon. Please.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.151
Please, please.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.862
Please, no.

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:19.243
Please. Please.
Please, don't do this.

01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:22.746
No! No! No!

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:25.416
Please, Dad.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.100
Fenton?

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:45.769
Fenton.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.648
Fenton, you all right?

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:52.109
Adam?

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:54.528
Adam, is that you?

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:00.743
Adam.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:03.871
Adam, you gotta get me out of here.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.122
I can't.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.625
But I'm hungry
and I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.627
Dad won't let me feed you.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.796
I brought you some water, though.

01:08:12.964 --> 01:08:15.174
He says you can have a cup a day.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.341
But I'll bring you more if I can.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.345
Look, Adam. He's gonna kill me.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.055
You've gotta get me out of here.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:23.557
I can't.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:26.477
Put your mouth to the knothole
right here.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.898
You ready? Here.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.702
You want some more,
or do you want me to save it for later?

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.412
More. More.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.801
You've gotta get me out of here, Adam.

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.804
Dad says you'll probably be out
by the end of the week.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.348
You just have to accept God's will.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.350
A week? I can't stay in here that long.

01:09:07.519 --> 01:09:09.394
I'll pray for you.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:13.857
Adam? Adam! Adam!

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:22.533
Adam.

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:28.080
The days came and went.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.459
I counted them by the cracks
of light through the hatch door...

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:35.127
...and Adam's visits with the water.

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:39.174
I only slept when I passed out
from exhaustion.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.218
What about your dad?

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:44.220
Didn't he ever come back
to at least check on you?

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:46.598
On the seventh day.

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:57.985
Has God spoken to you yet?

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:03.740
There is no God.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.341
I lost count of the days after that.

01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:23.760
It felt like weeks.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:28.265
I finally went beyond fear
into total insanity.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.977
I saw God.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:34.771
He had finally sent me a vision.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:39.276
It was then that I understood my destiny,
just like Dad said I would.

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:44.823
Dad, Fenton's not answering.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.621
Fenton? Fenton?

01:11:02.342 --> 01:11:06.762
Fenton. Fenton.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:09.973
Boy. Come on, kiddo.

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:12.476
Get me that water.

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:19.441
Easy, boy. Easy.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:20.901
Easy.

01:11:21.069 --> 01:11:24.655
See? There you go, kiddo.
There you go, buddy.

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:25.948
Come on.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.991
Dad?

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.577
I saw God.

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.624
Here.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.876
Just try to take a little sip.

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:51.139
Hey, slow down there.
Don't wanna eat too fast.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.516
You'll make yourself sick.

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:55.852
So did God tell you about the demons?

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.563
Sorry I ever doubted you, Dad.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.858
I'm sorry too, son.

01:12:02.402 --> 01:12:03.860
What did God look like?

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:05.946
Kind of hard to describe.

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:08.490
-Was he big?
-Adam.

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:12.828
Let your brother eat in peace.
He can't explain something like that.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:16.039
-But I wanna know.
-Then maybe you should pray for it.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:19.501
It's not fair. All I have seen are demons
and he gets to see God.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.545
That's right.

01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:24.256
But look at the price he paid.

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:28.218
That's all behind us now.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:31.054
It's a new day, isn't it, Fenton?

01:12:32.432 --> 01:12:34.391
So we gonna go get us
a demon now?

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.810
After a while.

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.895
When Fenton's ready.

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:48.071
A week later, I was ready.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:52.993
My first demon was to be Brad White
from Dallas.

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:56.997
-There it is.
-I see it.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.559
You sure you're ready for this?

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:19.978
Yes, sir.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:26.735
I bought these for you.

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:29.946
You'll need them now
that God has spoken to you.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:38.205
-All right. Let's go.
-I wanna go too, Dad.

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:40.123
Not this time, Adam.

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:42.292
You stay here. Keep your eyes peeled.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.504
Don't worry. Your time will come.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:50.217
Let's go.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.795
Hey.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.630
-Sorry to bother you--
-Yeah?

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.675
--but my son and I,
we got a flat on our van.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:33.969
Yeah.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:37.848
Well, I was wondering if you had a tire
iron. We went off and left ours at home.

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:40.725
Hey, pal, what's with the gloves?

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:44.020
Oh, to change the tire.

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:46.064
-Don't wanna get your hands dirty.
-Yeah.

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:48.275
Brad, who is it?

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:50.861
Mind your business, you fucking bitch!

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.240
Goddamn women.

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:02.122
Yeah, I think I got one for you.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:05.792
-Out back.
-Great.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:11.882
Back here.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.144
Let's see.

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:29.733
Here it is.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.364
Shit.

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:43.580
Grab his legs.

01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:14.527
Brad White?

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.204
You know, Fenton...

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:28.083
...I've been waiting for this moment
ever since all this started.

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:34.339
I'm ready to fulfill my destiny.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:38.218
I'm proud of you, son.

01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:50.272
Fuck you!

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.148
You fuck!

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:54.276
Get the fuck out of here!

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:55.819
Get the fuck out of--

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.925
Destroy him.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.832
Dad!

01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:00.342
Daddy, no. No.

01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:03.428
No, Dad, no.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:52.769
No!

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.870
We buried him in the rose garden.

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:19.170
We went to the sheriff's office
a week later and told them...

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:24.050
...that Dad just didn't come home
one day.

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:30.473
They filed a missing persons,
but they didn't find anything.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:36.771
After a while, they sent us
to separate orphanages.

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:41.484
So nobody ever knew about any of this?

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:43.319
No.

01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:47.574
Not until now.

01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:52.328
What about Adam?
He didn't tell anybody?

01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:02.505
Do you mind if we just sit here a while?
I don't much feel like talking anymore.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:17.830
Tell me more about that promise
you made to your brother.

01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:24.087
It was later on that night.

01:21:58.289 --> 01:21:59.789
Adam?

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:06.671
If you ever destroy me,
promise me you'll bury me here.

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:10.633
I promise to God I'll bury you here.

01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:23.146
I don't get it.

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:27.483
He promised you
that he'd bury you here.

01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:29.110
Yeah.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:30.653
If he killed you.

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:34.365
No, not killed. Destroyed.

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:36.701
Don't make any sense.

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:40.913
Yes, it does...

01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:48.546
...if the man standing in front of you
is Adam Meiks.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.525
So you killed all those people.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:15.406
No. No, I told you before,
I've never killed anyone in my life.

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:16.658
Fenton was the killer.

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:20.119
Just stop the bullshit
and tell me the truth.

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:22.538
You'll understand soon.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:25.041
So let me show you
where I buried Fenton.

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:26.793
Hold it.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.964
Take it real slow.

01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:05.456
This is it.

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.336
This is the spot.

01:24:15.509 --> 01:24:17.427
There's too many graves here.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:20.221
There's only six victims.

01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:26.769
Fenton didn't bury his victims here.

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:28.855
He kept them as trophies
in his basement.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.068
This is where I put demons.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.615
You thought your brother was a demon?

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:42.034
He was.

01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:48.249
That's why he couldn't see the truth.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:52.628
Dad knew it too.
He just couldn't accept it.

01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:58.342
You see, God asked Dad
to destroy his son...

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:02.305
...much like he asked Abraham
to sacrifice his son Isaac.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:06.017
But Dad couldn't do it.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:10.521
And God didn't take pity on Dad
like he did Abraham.

01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:19.822
So he handed down the duty to me.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:23.993
Fenton knew I'd come sooner or later.

01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:27.121
That's why he left those notes,
to lure me in.

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:32.502
I guess he figured that when the killings
made the news, I'd come for him.

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:37.298
But I had to wait till God
put him on my list.

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:41.177
To come before that
would've been murder.

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:33.896
Adam?

01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:52.039
Jesus Christ,
you really do believe all this stuff.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.751
I've always believed.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:02.049
It's all lies, Adam.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.260
No, it's not.
I see it when he touches them.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.260
You're just crazy as hell...

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:50.473
...Fenton or Adam
or whatever your damn name is.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.477
I don't really give a fuck.

01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:58.981
All I need to know right now...

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:02.860
...is you're a murdering son of a bitch.

01:28:03.362 --> 01:28:05.071
And I got you.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:08.074
Maybe.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.578
But that's not gonna bring
your mother back, is it?

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.916
She's dead...

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:20.169
...and her killer got away, didn't he?

01:28:22.673 --> 01:28:25.675
Goddamn you, dirty little son of a--

01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:51.158
How did you know?

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:53.661
You were on my list.

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:18.394
You didn't think anybody knew
about that, did you?

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:22.690
God knew. That's why he sent me.

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:51.135
I'm an FBI agent.

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:55.181
They'll come looking for me.

01:29:56.099 --> 01:29:57.391
No, they won't.

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:01.228
They'll keep looking for Fenton.

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:05.107
You're gonna be his last victim.

01:30:06.485 --> 01:30:09.195
They've seen you.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.614
They'll know it was you.

01:30:22.459 --> 01:30:24.293
God will protect me.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:39.391
Just a couple units on the right side.

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.977
That's right. I want him found.
I want him found now.

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:44.980
I can't right now. I can't.
I'll get back to you.

01:30:45.148 --> 01:30:46.607
-Here.
-Thank you.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:47.858
I was here by myself.

01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:50.611
Sure neither one of you
can remember what he looks like?

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:53.155
Look, I told you, it's just a blur.

01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:56.492
I can't understand it.
I looked right at him. I shook his hand.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.744
Hey, we've got a problem.

01:30:58.912 --> 01:31:01.288
Gotta take a look at this.

01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:06.710
There he is.

01:31:07.546 --> 01:31:09.797
We got you now, buddy.

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:12.716
-What is this?
-Can't explain it.

01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:15.136
All the tapes look like this.

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.304
Goddamn it.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.349
We're running the name
he gave you now.

01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:23.686
-It's gotta be a fake name.
-Sounds fake.

01:31:23.854 --> 01:31:26.188
Fenton Meiks.

01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:29.358
Fenton Meiks, this is the FBI.
We're coming in.

01:31:29.526 --> 01:31:31.735
Go, go, go!

01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:38.742
-Clear.
-Clear.

01:31:39.578 --> 01:31:41.078
Clear.

01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:43.539
Clear.

01:31:49.379 --> 01:31:50.921
-Anything?
-No.

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:53.215
All right, let's dust it.

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:00.389
Oh, my God.

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.561
There's no one here, sir.

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:08.480
We found this in the basement.

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:15.571
Is he down there too?

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:18.574
Not him.

01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:38.761
Excuse me.

01:32:38.929 --> 01:32:41.305
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
How can I help you?

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:43.766
I'm with the FBI.
I need to speak to the sheriff.

01:32:43.934 --> 01:32:45.768
-Is he in?
-Sure thing.

01:32:45.936 --> 01:32:47.478
Sheriff?

01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:49.939
Would you like some coffee?

01:32:50.106 --> 01:32:52.399
No, I'm fine, thanks.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:59.031
-Well, hey, Curtis.
-Afternoon, Becky.

01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:13.254
-Sheriff?
-Yeah.

01:33:15.966 --> 01:33:17.925
I'm Agent Griffin Hull of the FBI.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:20.928
I need to ask you some questions
about your brother.

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:25.641
-Fenton?
-Yes, sir.

01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:31.272
Why don't you come on around back?

01:33:38.655 --> 01:33:40.906
I appreciate you coming by
to tell me personally.

01:33:41.074 --> 01:33:43.909
I just wanted you to know
before we go public.

01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:48.080
Well, listen, if there's anything
I can do, don't hesitate to call.

01:33:48.248 --> 01:33:50.165
I think we got it covered from here.

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:52.793
But if you can think
of where he might have gone...

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:54.837
-...or if he contacts you.
-Of course.

01:33:55.005 --> 01:33:56.672
All right.

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:01.760
You're a good man, Agent Hull.

01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:42.634
Everything okay, Adam?

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.680
Everything's just fine, Becky.

01:34:47.474 --> 01:34:50.142
God's will has been served.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.811
Praise God.
