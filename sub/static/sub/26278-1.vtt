00:46.253 --> 00:48.555
Well, looking at the
evidence, Crabtree...

00:48.579 --> 00:49.690
- Yes?
- It looks like

00:49.701 --> 00:51.894
- we've slightly narrowed it down.
- Yes, I thought so as well, sir.

00:51.912 --> 00:53.765
You'll both be coming tonight?

00:53.800 --> 00:56.880
- For the third time, yes.
- Excellent.

00:57.629 --> 00:59.413
I'll see you then.

01:01.255 --> 01:03.942
He's certainly seems
in fine spirits, sir.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.178
I don't know I've ever seen
him in such a good mood.

01:06.212 --> 01:08.186
I know. It's unsettling.

01:24.779 --> 01:26.431
- Oh, William!
- Julia.

01:26.466 --> 01:28.521
- All set to go?
- I am indeed.

01:28.550 --> 01:30.392
Have a lovely evening, gentlemen.

01:30.944 --> 01:32.423
How was school?

01:32.629 --> 01:36.441
It is so much more interesting
cutting into living tissue than dead.

01:36.476 --> 01:39.531
You should have seen the size of
the cyst I helped removed today!

01:39.554 --> 01:41.845
- I'm sorry I missed that.
- Shall we race?

01:41.881 --> 01:44.194
Oh.

01:49.917 --> 01:52.190
Woo!

01:59.440 --> 02:00.999
Well...

02:02.595 --> 02:04.277
Here it is.

02:05.371 --> 02:06.942
There it is.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.097
You don't like it?

02:10.707 --> 02:13.084
Well, it's... different.

02:16.295 --> 02:17.924
William?

02:19.070 --> 02:21.695
- Julia?
- It is our first home.

02:22.956 --> 02:25.962
Right. Uh... yes.

02:36.354 --> 02:37.810
Uh...

02:37.935 --> 02:39.514
Hello?

02:45.961 --> 02:48.313
... had the opportunity
to collaborate with,

02:48.347 --> 02:53.558
you seem to me to have
the most vision, yes?

02:53.619 --> 02:56.118
- You couldn't imagine...
- Ahem!

02:56.119 --> 02:59.801
Oh! Detective Murdoch. Doctor.

03:00.066 --> 03:02.461
- Welcome to your new home.
- Mr. Wright...

03:02.865 --> 03:04.862
What are you doing here?

03:04.885 --> 03:07.188
We're showing off your
new house, of course.

03:07.193 --> 03:08.523
I beg your pardon?

03:08.574 --> 03:11.142
As the owner of Mr. Frank
Lloyd Wright's first home

03:11.159 --> 03:13.323
in the Toronto area, you
have certain obligations.

03:13.387 --> 03:15.753
- Oblig... Julia?
- Oh...

03:15.764 --> 03:17.687
According to the
contract Dr. Ogden signed

03:17.699 --> 03:20.542
when commissioning Mr. Wright,
your home will serve as a show house

03:20.560 --> 03:22.247
for the first 90 days of possession.

03:22.281 --> 03:24.394
This won't be a daily occurrence.

03:24.429 --> 03:28.056
- Oh... That's heartening.
- Now, come.

03:28.079 --> 03:29.524
Meet our guests.

03:31.654 --> 03:36.139
I suppose I didn't examine
the contract closely enough.

03:36.429 --> 03:38.298
Champagne!

03:46.306 --> 03:48.418
We do appreciate the commission.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.404
Toronto is a very stodgy town.

03:50.439 --> 03:54.129
You are one of the few to see
the genius of Mr. Wright's vision.

03:55.016 --> 03:56.732
You there!

03:58.102 --> 04:00.888
Stop. Stop.

04:01.974 --> 04:04.853
What? What are you doing here?

04:05.423 --> 04:08.048
I'm here to admire my work.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.376
Your work? You did little
more than follow instructions.

04:11.410 --> 04:13.540
Now, you wish to take credit
for everything I've done?

04:13.943 --> 04:15.367
Get out.

04:15.401 --> 04:17.651
- I...
- If you wish to work

04:17.670 --> 04:20.403
for Mr. Wright again,
I suggest you leave.

04:29.189 --> 04:30.617
Well...

04:30.687 --> 04:32.961
they do say that all
great men have an ego.

04:32.978 --> 04:35.966
I'm glad I don't.

04:36.091 --> 04:37.618
- Murdoch!
- Ah!

04:37.647 --> 04:40.042
Ah. Ooh.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.999
Oh...

04:42.863 --> 04:45.091
Didn't get around to decorating, I see.

04:45.114 --> 04:47.711
- Oh!
- From Margaret and myself.

04:47.723 --> 04:50.003
- Oh. Why thank you, Inspector.
- George.

04:50.026 --> 04:51.713
Thank you, sir.

04:54.943 --> 04:57.142
Inspector, George,

04:57.176 --> 04:59.077
this is Frank Lloyd Wright,

04:59.111 --> 05:00.867
the man responsible for our new home.

05:01.616 --> 05:04.108
- It appears you forgot something.
- And what's that?

05:04.356 --> 05:06.083
There are no bloody walls.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.305
Rooms don't need walls.

05:08.881 --> 05:10.689
Then there are no rooms.

05:10.723 --> 05:14.062
Oi. You there.

05:14.079 --> 05:16.371
Inspector... Can I fix you a drink?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.242
Oh, very good.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.833
- Detective.
- Yes, George?

05:20.958 --> 05:22.692
I would very much like to see

05:22.721 --> 05:25.565
your potato cooking
room in full operation.

05:25.589 --> 05:27.403
Of everything I've done,

05:27.440 --> 05:29.965
that is the feature of
this home you've boasted of?

05:32.135 --> 05:34.282
You have installed it, Mr. Wright?

05:35.071 --> 05:36.487
Reluctantly.

05:38.150 --> 05:41.071
George, I have a house full
of guests, perhaps now isn't...

05:41.087 --> 05:43.834
Sir! Louise Cherry?

05:44.836 --> 05:48.368
Have you invited her here?
I most certainly have not.

05:49.527 --> 05:53.147
Perhaps Mr. Wright is simply trying
to draw attention to his... creation.

05:53.170 --> 05:56.055
- Sir, I'm not keen on her.
- I know, George.

05:56.072 --> 05:57.817
I mean, you know what she's like.

05:57.837 --> 06:00.275
- She said that you and Doctor Ogden were bor...
- Sh.

06:00.298 --> 06:02.998
What's that noise?

06:03.027 --> 06:04.581
Oh, my!

06:34.306 --> 06:37.899
Sir, we've taken preliminary
statements from most of the guests.

06:37.934 --> 06:39.678
How do you suppose he ended up in there?

06:39.718 --> 06:41.699
Perhaps he thought it
was the water closet.

06:41.728 --> 06:43.001
Detective...

06:43.421 --> 06:45.066
if you have no more questions,

06:45.067 --> 06:46.863
my wife and I have another engagement.

06:46.881 --> 06:48.861
I may need to make further inquiries.

06:48.878 --> 06:51.320
Then you may do so at
a more convenient time.

06:51.902 --> 06:53.801
Do not call before 11.

06:55.725 --> 06:57.659
Let us finish taking statements

06:57.694 --> 07:00.598
- and pick this up in the morning.
- Calling it a night, Murdoch?

07:00.723 --> 07:02.524
I suppose it's for the best.

07:02.649 --> 07:05.633
Thank you so much for
the lamp, Inspector.

07:05.656 --> 07:07.924
- Oh yes, thank you.
- Uh... oh.

07:07.936 --> 07:09.939
Yeah. Good evening.

07:12.017 --> 07:14.826
Well... I suppose it
wouldn't be our house

07:14.838 --> 07:16.992
if something like this didn't happen.

07:17.544 --> 07:19.675
Oh, sir.

07:19.916 --> 07:23.462
- Now is definitely not a good time, George.
- Of course.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.782
Detective Murdoch.

07:26.628 --> 07:28.114
Miss Cherry.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.496
- Do you have any statements at this time?
- I do not.

07:40.612 --> 07:42.771
- _
- What?!

07:43.266 --> 07:45.557
A less than enjoyable evening, sir?

07:46.530 --> 07:49.150
- It started out well enough.
- Oh. Very good.

07:49.184 --> 07:51.417
I hope you can grace us
with your presence, sir.

07:51.753 --> 07:54.005
Oh. Oh.

07:57.391 --> 08:00.287
"Henry Hieronymus Higgins."

08:00.412 --> 08:02.428
Higgins wasn't given a middle name, sir,

08:02.442 --> 08:05.454
- so he chose that.
- Do you like it?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.609
It suits you.

08:10.041 --> 08:12.796
Henry, please find out all you can about

08:12.829 --> 08:15.845
- Frank Lloyd Wright and the rest of my guests.
- Of course.

08:15.970 --> 08:18.033
Shame I didn't get a
chance to meet them.

08:18.691 --> 08:20.971
Would have made it easier... Oh!

08:21.571 --> 08:23.909
Sir, I look forward to seeing you there.

08:23.941 --> 08:25.167
Ah!

08:25.420 --> 08:28.553
Oh. My wife has
reminded me to remind you

08:28.566 --> 08:30.427
that she is a wedding planner.

08:30.455 --> 08:32.633
Oh... yes.

08:32.647 --> 08:35.801
Well, uh, I am leaving that
all in Ruth's hands, sir.

08:37.690 --> 08:41.119
- Be glad when this bloody day is over.
- Oh, I concur, sir.

08:41.556 --> 08:44.869
So... what did you
think to Murdoch's house?

08:44.994 --> 08:47.905
I thought it was... really something.

08:47.947 --> 08:49.657
Didn't think much of
it either, eh Crabtree?

08:49.666 --> 08:52.034
- Well, sir, I...
- It's just a bloody box.

08:52.038 --> 08:54.180
No charm or character at all.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.975
The Detective likes it.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.481
Of course.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.250
It suits him.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.593
I hope you're not missing
an important class.

09:03.616 --> 09:05.822
Oh, nothing I can't catch up on.

09:05.901 --> 09:09.453
I have a surgery in the next
couple of days, but I'm prepared.

09:09.578 --> 09:11.618
I assure you, I can handle this.

09:11.743 --> 09:13.794
I need no such assurances,

09:13.806 --> 09:16.892
but seeing the death was in my
home, I'd like to look into it.

09:16.926 --> 09:19.218
There's not much to
look into, I'm afraid.

09:19.264 --> 09:22.306
- Afternoon. Miss Hart.
- Detective.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.642
Do you have the victim's belongings?

09:24.720 --> 09:27.545
Yes. What's left of
them are right over here.

09:27.857 --> 09:30.399
His name was Mr. Lionel Spoud.

09:30.469 --> 09:33.017
Spoud. I know that name.

09:33.053 --> 09:35.319
I talked to him about
designing our home.

09:35.444 --> 09:38.456
Oh, yes. "Architecture and contractors."

09:38.681 --> 09:42.048
Detective, if he was cooked,
why didn't the paper burn?

09:42.103 --> 09:46.215
The machine is designed to seek
out moisture in order to heat.

09:46.243 --> 09:48.550
Did you find out anything
more about the victim?

09:48.757 --> 09:51.520
That was all. I will let
you know if I find any more.

09:51.534 --> 09:53.008
Thank you.

09:57.002 --> 09:58.862
So, do you have any idea

09:58.876 --> 10:00.654
on how we can establish time of death?

10:02.040 --> 10:03.371
Not really.

10:03.928 --> 10:05.006
Good.

10:05.056 --> 10:07.281
I was hoping I wasn't alone in that one.

10:09.502 --> 10:11.956
I built the room exactly
to your specifications.

10:11.975 --> 10:14.692
There is no other point of
access other than the obvious.

10:15.554 --> 10:17.948
I am not accusing you
of anything, Mr. Towne.

10:19.206 --> 10:22.480
Why do you think the
poor unfortunate exploded?

10:24.272 --> 10:28.230
I think the different areas of
whatever may be inside my device

10:28.264 --> 10:30.222
are heating at different rates.

10:30.466 --> 10:32.728
Uneven cooking could be the cause.

10:33.695 --> 10:35.413
Perhaps if I devised

10:35.435 --> 10:37.738
some sort of turntable mechanism,

10:37.821 --> 10:41.743
that would allow for whatever
is inside to cook evenly...

10:42.287 --> 10:43.845
Who was the fellow?

10:45.246 --> 10:47.607
A Mr. Lionel Spoud.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.682
- Oh...
- You knew him?

10:51.220 --> 10:53.397
I worked for him once or twice.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.490
Strange thing, though,

10:55.524 --> 10:58.832
he and Mr. Wright were on the outs.
So why would he be at the party?

10:59.684 --> 11:02.139
Perhaps to be placed inside of my device

11:02.172 --> 11:04.723
to kill him and thereby
destroy all evidence.

11:05.034 --> 11:07.957
Who else knew what my
cooking room was capable of?

11:08.082 --> 11:11.291
Mr. Wright and Miss Ryand for certain.

11:12.268 --> 11:15.012
But Mr. Wright showed a
number of people your home

11:15.026 --> 11:16.921
at the various stages of construction.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.571
Mr. Dodds, another architect,

11:19.598 --> 11:21.155
showed keen interest.

11:21.735 --> 11:24.826
- So you knew the victim.
- Professionally.

11:25.421 --> 11:26.622
You were friends?

11:26.663 --> 11:29.325
Are two men in competition
ever truly friends?

11:29.509 --> 11:31.292
Mr. Spoud, Mr. Wright and myself

11:31.306 --> 11:34.019
were all competing for a
number of lucrative contracts.

11:34.430 --> 11:37.215
And all three of you were
at a party in my home.

11:37.546 --> 11:39.573
It's good to keep tabs on each other.

11:40.522 --> 11:43.474
Did you speak with Mr.
Spoud while you were there?

11:43.501 --> 11:45.090
I didn't even see him until,

11:45.113 --> 11:47.742
well, until there was
little left of him to see.

11:49.502 --> 11:52.938
And now it seems there are
only two of you in competition.

11:53.205 --> 11:55.366
You could say that, but this is Toronto.

11:55.384 --> 11:58.465
I doubt there would be any brave
enough to embrace Mr. Wright's vision.

11:58.534 --> 12:00.768
Present company excepted, of course.

12:02.389 --> 12:06.056
So now all of Mr. Spoud's
work could find its way to you.

12:06.228 --> 12:09.206
It's funny how life works
out sometimes, isn't it?

12:11.449 --> 12:14.360
You know, I am endeavouring
to become a better man.

12:14.392 --> 12:16.992
- Ruth has been helping me with that.
- It sounds like quite the job.

12:16.994 --> 12:18.468
Yes. So I am trying my best

12:18.486 --> 12:21.056
to not disinvite the
Detective from my wedding.

12:21.978 --> 12:25.179
I know it's petty but really,
I've worked shoulder to shoulder

12:25.183 --> 12:27.048
with the man for more than 10 years.

12:27.066 --> 12:30.037
Would it be that hard for him to
invite me to his housewarming party?

12:30.060 --> 12:31.598
Higgins, it wasn't much of an affair.

12:31.621 --> 12:34.665
Well, you were there.
As was the Inspector.

12:34.857 --> 12:37.300
- And I'm a Newsome. You'd think...
- You're a Newsome?

12:37.341 --> 12:39.367
Well, by marriage I shall be.

12:39.381 --> 12:40.647
You'd think my attendance would be

12:40.671 --> 12:42.613
- a feather in the Detective's cap...
- Henny Penny!

12:42.637 --> 12:43.798
Ruthie!

12:44.700 --> 12:46.808
That's enough, that's enough,
that's enough, thank you.

12:46.832 --> 12:48.200
Oh!

12:49.545 --> 12:52.125
I trust you're keeping our
city's streets safe, Henry.

12:52.493 --> 12:54.612
- Constable Crabtree.
- Miss Newsome.

12:54.676 --> 12:56.983
- You will be coming to the rehearsal?
- Yes.

12:57.066 --> 12:59.172
And your lady companion?

12:59.215 --> 13:01.382
- I won't be bringing one.
- What?

13:01.419 --> 13:04.754
What? No. No, no, the seating
plan's already been arranged.

13:04.987 --> 13:07.051
There's really nobody I want to bring.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.880
Well, that will not do. Will it, Henry?

13:08.903 --> 13:10.939
- No, Ruthie.
- You leave it to me, George Crabtree.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.357
I'll make sure you've a suitable
companion for our nuptials.

13:13.370 --> 13:15.536
- But...
- I won't hear another word of it.

13:17.148 --> 13:18.587
You're a lucky man, George.

13:18.605 --> 13:21.488
Ruth has some exceptional
friends of very high breeding.

13:21.613 --> 13:23.410
I'm sure she will find you a companion

13:23.424 --> 13:25.284
that exceeds your expectations.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.439
Mr. Wright was vying to
design the new city library,

13:30.485 --> 13:32.594
but he didn't stand a chance.

13:32.719 --> 13:35.588
Why not? He's an architect of some note.

13:36.090 --> 13:40.328
Most on the Board of Control
considered his designs to be brutish.

13:41.525 --> 13:44.415
Will the city consider
Mr. Wright's designs

13:44.438 --> 13:46.628
now that Mr. Spoud is dead?

13:46.662 --> 13:50.041
Toronto? I very much doubt it.

13:50.166 --> 13:52.013
If he is to achieve any success here,

13:52.036 --> 13:53.913
it'll be through private commissions.

13:54.038 --> 13:56.338
All he needs do is hook one big fish

13:56.356 --> 13:57.489
and others will follow.

13:57.614 --> 13:59.174
I told him as much.

13:59.897 --> 14:01.445
I've commissioned him.

14:01.911 --> 14:03.518
With respect, Detective,

14:03.746 --> 14:05.314
you're not much of a fish.

14:05.439 --> 14:08.650
Mr. Wright needed someone
with the proper address.

14:12.281 --> 14:15.666
We talked with Mr. Wright
on numerous occasions

14:15.689 --> 14:17.504
before we employed Mr. Spoud.

14:17.629 --> 14:20.152
My husband was keen
on his work, I was not.

14:20.696 --> 14:23.307
- So, you chose Mr. Spoud?
- Yes,

14:23.473 --> 14:26.089
but now I suppose my
husband will get his wish.

14:26.968 --> 14:30.364
Has Mr. Wright contacted you
about designing your new home?

14:30.396 --> 14:32.546
On the very evening
of Mr. Spoud's death.

14:33.541 --> 14:36.144
Did you know the identity
of the man who died?

14:36.199 --> 14:38.124
- No.
- Not until you told us.

14:38.981 --> 14:41.827
He was the man who beat you
for the Ferguson commission.

14:41.855 --> 14:43.204
I wasn't beat.

14:43.222 --> 14:45.926
Mr. Ferguson made a poor choice.

14:47.225 --> 14:50.619
If Jersey Ferguson chose
someone else for the commission,

14:50.633 --> 14:52.448
then why invite him to the party?

14:52.476 --> 14:54.272
I wanted him to see your house.

14:54.723 --> 14:55.840
I felt...

14:55.965 --> 14:57.759
once he saw what I'd done for you,

14:57.772 --> 14:59.753
he would have a change of heart.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.875
- Then why invite Mr. Spoud?
- We didn't.

15:03.124 --> 15:04.492
He was there.

15:04.556 --> 15:06.665
Mr. Spoud was an unwelcome guest

15:06.684 --> 15:09.641
numerous times while your
home was under construction.

15:09.766 --> 15:12.939
I had nothing to do with the
fact he was at the unveiling.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.975
So, you didn't see him?

15:15.317 --> 15:17.513
If I had, he would have
been out on his ear.

15:17.545 --> 15:20.423
Spoud is a dinosaur.
Mr. Wright is the future.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.467
I am sure he was at the
party because he was concerned

15:22.477 --> 15:24.789
once the Fergusons saw
your home, he'd be fired.

15:25.005 --> 15:26.851
But we had nothing
to do with his demise.

15:26.976 --> 15:28.362
It seems to me

15:28.661 --> 15:30.591
your device was the
thing that killed him.

15:30.605 --> 15:33.768
Which someone turned on
with him inside of it.

15:34.009 --> 15:35.764
It wasn't us.

15:39.108 --> 15:43.064
Mrs. Ferguson stated that you
gave her your business card

15:43.098 --> 15:45.573
- right after the man died.
- I did.

15:45.698 --> 15:48.463
- Why?
- To see if her heart had changed.

15:48.624 --> 15:50.865
Mr. Murdoch, we may be
having another showing

15:50.879 --> 15:51.984
of the Murdoch House soon.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.688
May I remind you there are
to be no garish additions.

16:20.007 --> 16:21.757
I'm almost done.

16:23.069 --> 16:26.437
Do you think you'll still
want to use this after...

16:26.765 --> 16:30.019
William. Of course.

16:30.053 --> 16:32.360
You're not squeamish, are you?

16:33.278 --> 16:36.357
You designed this brilliant device.

16:36.404 --> 16:38.465
I shall put it to good use.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.819
All right then.

16:51.383 --> 16:53.404
You don't like it, do you?

16:54.048 --> 16:56.529
Oh... I love it!

16:56.552 --> 16:57.905
And I bargained!

16:57.940 --> 17:00.473
I got us that statue for half price.

17:00.484 --> 17:03.017
Not Apu Inti, I mean the house!

17:03.080 --> 17:06.160
Oh... yes.

17:06.361 --> 17:08.829
Oh, no.

17:08.864 --> 17:10.607
Mr. Wright.

17:12.478 --> 17:14.602
Doctor Ogden, may I come in?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.714
Oh, my.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.065
Well, that certainly is something.

17:22.377 --> 17:24.545
We purchased it on our travels.

17:25.104 --> 17:27.882
What can we do for you, Miss Cherry?

17:27.915 --> 17:30.096
I was curious as to whether there was

17:30.114 --> 17:32.596
any more news on your mysterious death?

17:33.435 --> 17:35.059
There is not.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.753
And I would prefer if
you directed your inquires

17:37.776 --> 17:40.729
to Station House No.
4, not my personal home.

17:40.942 --> 17:43.573
I thought I'd learn more
at the scene of the crime.

17:44.529 --> 17:47.511
- It is not a mansion.
- It isn't.

17:47.810 --> 17:49.974
- Excuse me?
- Our home,

17:50.014 --> 17:54.309
it's hardly a mansion.
Why did you call it that?

17:54.343 --> 17:56.339
I enjoyed the alliteration.

17:57.064 --> 17:58.987
Detective Murdoch,
if you keep me abreast

17:59.005 --> 18:01.532
of any further developments,
I'd be happy to share with you

18:01.549 --> 18:03.489
a piece of information
I recently learned.

18:04.307 --> 18:06.564
If it's germane to the investigation,

18:06.575 --> 18:08.399
you'll tell me regardless.

18:08.524 --> 18:11.676
Well, I suppose you'll read about
it in the paper tomorrow, so why not.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.645
It appears that Mrs.
Ferguson and Mr. Spoud

18:15.668 --> 18:18.532
were carrying on a torrid affair.

18:19.882 --> 18:23.368
Is this is what amounts to
news in this day and age?

18:23.888 --> 18:26.163
It certainly is, if it
points to the likely murderer.

18:26.697 --> 18:28.900
Wouldn't you say the
cuckolded Jersey Ferguson

18:28.923 --> 18:30.839
is now a primary suspect?

18:36.633 --> 18:38.453
I don't have all day.

18:38.642 --> 18:40.217
So you don't deny it?

18:40.226 --> 18:41.497
There wouldn't be much point.

18:41.529 --> 18:44.066
Mr. Spoud and I carried
on a brief affair.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.774
And your husband knew about it?

18:47.893 --> 18:49.556
He did walk in on us at a time

18:49.579 --> 18:52.139
when it would have been difficult
to disguise what we were doing.

18:52.301 --> 18:53.605
Is that all?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.809
- For now.
- Thank you.

19:01.624 --> 19:04.639
Despite her studies, Doctor
Ogden is still the coroner.

19:04.671 --> 19:06.528
And she's hardly in the office.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.558
If that were the case, you
wouldn't be complaining.

19:08.572 --> 19:10.336
I have been dealing with
the day to day business

19:10.350 --> 19:12.279
of the Coroner's office for
months while the Murdochs

19:12.298 --> 19:14.214
- were in South America.
- That's correct.

19:14.624 --> 19:17.295
Do you have any complaints
about the quality of my work?

19:18.574 --> 19:21.252
I have letters of recommendation
from Inspector McWorthy

19:21.275 --> 19:23.462
and others, and I have qualifications.

19:23.479 --> 19:24.687
All that may be true,

19:24.714 --> 19:27.174
but Doctor Ogden is still
the Coroner of Record.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.184
And when she finally leaves?

19:29.892 --> 19:31.969
You may get my
recommendation, Miss Hart,

19:31.973 --> 19:33.488
but it will make no difference.

19:34.801 --> 19:36.124
And why is that?

19:37.716 --> 19:40.529
Have you ever wondered why
Murdoch is still only a detective?

19:41.852 --> 19:43.665
What does that have to do with anything?

19:43.699 --> 19:45.021
He's a Catholic,

19:45.140 --> 19:47.489
that means he will
never be more than he is.

19:48.313 --> 19:50.005
The same is in store for you.

19:50.225 --> 19:52.790
No matter how competent you are,
you will never get the position.

19:53.242 --> 19:54.715
You are a woman...

19:54.840 --> 19:56.065
and you're black.

19:56.244 --> 19:59.344
You should consider yourself lucky
you are where you are, young lady.

20:03.163 --> 20:05.020
And what do you look for in a woman?

20:05.290 --> 20:07.469
I don't know, Miss Newsome.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.232
Punctuality. I admire punctuality.

20:10.357 --> 20:11.849
And ambition.

20:11.890 --> 20:15.156
Ambitious, but also nurturing.

20:15.281 --> 20:17.098
A woman who possesses

20:17.133 --> 20:21.185
- a keen mind and a ready smile.
- Sorry, taken.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.804
I suppose what I'm really
looking for is a woman

20:24.028 --> 20:27.327
who can indulge her own
interests and have a family.

20:27.345 --> 20:30.638
Well, that's impossible. You
have to choose one or the other.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.791
- I don't think I can.
- All right.

20:32.828 --> 20:34.771
Let's discuss what is truly important.

20:34.896 --> 20:38.865
What should she look like?
Should she be tall? Or thin?

20:38.990 --> 20:41.632
Full in the chest? Hmm?

20:41.651 --> 20:43.935
I cannot stop Ellen from
doing what she wants.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.783
But you could have put
a stop to the affair?

20:46.908 --> 20:49.187
By killing Mr. Spoud?
Why would I do that?

20:49.496 --> 20:52.623
It took me six months to find a
suitable architect for my home.

20:54.018 --> 20:55.902
The man was sleeping with your wife.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.601
If that was motive for murder,

20:57.610 --> 21:00.296
I dare say I could kill half
the men in my neighbourhood.

21:01.907 --> 21:04.730
So, you didn't confront
Mr. Spoud at the party?

21:04.780 --> 21:06.715
I didn't even see him at the party.

21:06.749 --> 21:08.939
Now, I have a question for you.

21:09.294 --> 21:11.253
How do you like your new place?

21:16.198 --> 21:17.373
Oh, sir.

21:17.419 --> 21:18.736
What do you think?

21:21.605 --> 21:24.499
- The tobacco leaf one.
- Mm!

21:24.949 --> 21:26.911
Excellent choice, sir. Thank you.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.375
Henry, do you have that
information I requested

21:29.380 --> 21:31.328
on Mr. Wright and the others?

21:32.051 --> 21:33.303
Information?

21:33.704 --> 21:35.090
I specifically asked

21:35.132 --> 21:38.260
- for a full background on all...
- Oh, sorry sir. I've been terribly busy.

21:38.310 --> 21:41.778
- The wedding is less than three weeks away.
- Frank Lloyd Wright.

21:41.817 --> 21:43.487
Fascinating fellow.

21:43.612 --> 21:47.053
- You know of him?
- Good Lord man, who doesn't know Frank Lloyd Wright?

21:47.117 --> 21:49.400
In a bit of a financial jam

21:49.410 --> 21:51.580
since he split with Louis Sullivan, but

21:51.598 --> 21:53.607
I'll see what I can find out.

21:54.058 --> 21:57.452
- Well, good, that's settled.
- Henry!

21:57.470 --> 21:59.446
Henry! Sorry. Um...

21:59.571 --> 22:02.840
Henry! Henry, I am not at all happy

22:02.873 --> 22:05.142
with the vehicle that has been
chosen as our wedding carriage.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.883
I'd like you to take
care of it immediately.

22:06.907 --> 22:09.123
- On my way, turtle dove.
- Thank you.

22:09.657 --> 22:11.601
I need to speak with George Crabtree.

22:11.651 --> 22:13.448
Would you be a dear
and go fetch him for me?

22:15.484 --> 22:16.944
Thank you.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.753
What you are to do is
look at these photographs

22:22.762 --> 22:24.459
and decide on whom
your companion will be.

22:24.708 --> 22:27.066
- Who's she?
- Doesn't matter. Do you like her?

22:27.191 --> 22:29.866
- I don't know her.
- That's a no. What about her?

22:29.921 --> 22:33.039
- Oh, this is ridiculous.
- It is not, Constable Crabtree.

22:33.164 --> 22:34.875
Physical attraction is the tinder

22:34.893 --> 22:37.560
that ignites every relationship. So, no.

22:39.127 --> 22:40.127
Hmm...

22:40.177 --> 22:42.420
- What about her?
- Oh, no. Not her.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.896
- Why not?
- Trust me. I said no.

22:43.915 --> 22:46.152
Now, what about this
one? Miss Eliza Sinclair.

22:46.155 --> 22:47.757
Look, I've had enough of this.

22:48.351 --> 22:49.732
I'm simply trying to help.

22:49.857 --> 22:52.524
Well, I'll tell you what. You
bring me somebody who actually has

22:52.555 --> 22:55.718
some of the qualities that I
admire, and I will gladly meet her,

22:55.770 --> 22:58.161
if for no other reason than
to bring this all to an end.

22:58.427 --> 23:00.294
I accept your challenge.

23:00.313 --> 23:03.380
I will find you a woman who
possesses all the qualities you need.

23:04.076 --> 23:05.583
- And Miss Newsome...
- Hmm?

23:05.627 --> 23:08.449
If she happens to be a little
bit good looking, then...

23:08.976 --> 23:10.114
Heh.

23:13.622 --> 23:16.067
Whatever it is you want to talk
to me about, I'm not interested.

23:16.091 --> 23:19.416
- You haven't even heard the question.
- I am a member of the Fourth Estate.

23:19.467 --> 23:21.627
As such, I am the one
who asks the questions.

23:21.682 --> 23:24.128
So, you don't know what
Mr. Wright has been up to

23:24.141 --> 23:26.182
- while he's been in Toronto?
- I didn't say that.

23:26.265 --> 23:28.213
Has anyone else hired him?

23:28.245 --> 23:32.243
- I know Julia Ogden did.
- Yes, but anyone else-else?

23:32.280 --> 23:34.435
You're the detective, I'm the reporter.

23:34.490 --> 23:36.558
Why don't you find out,
and I'll write about it?

23:36.609 --> 23:40.768
But... I do know he is having a
luncheon with the Fergusons today.

23:40.805 --> 23:42.772
- How do you know that?
- Turn around.

23:44.462 --> 23:46.257
You're one heck of a detective.

23:57.514 --> 23:58.881
To the first brick.

24:04.883 --> 24:06.186
Why are we here?

24:06.421 --> 24:09.211
A man has died under
suspicious circumstances,

24:09.230 --> 24:11.404
and you are benefiting from it.

24:11.422 --> 24:13.297
So, you think one of us killed him?

24:13.674 --> 24:17.133
Well, motive often reveals
itself after the fact.

24:17.193 --> 24:20.882
A man showed up at a party, uninvited,

24:20.901 --> 24:22.526
wandered into a... a...

24:22.591 --> 24:24.659
poorly conceived device

24:24.784 --> 24:27.418
and accidentally killed himself.

24:27.487 --> 24:29.374
Or he was lured there

24:29.499 --> 24:31.737
and put inside against his will.

24:32.980 --> 24:35.007
Do you intend to charge me?

24:36.849 --> 24:38.285
Not at this time.

24:38.410 --> 24:41.767
Then... I have a home to create.

24:42.642 --> 24:46.205
Mr. Wright is going to be the
leading architect of the 20th century.

24:46.224 --> 24:49.220
He will achieve greatness whether
Mr. Spoud is alive or dead.

24:55.537 --> 24:56.859
What do you think?

24:56.984 --> 25:00.475
I think that behind every
successful man, there is a woman.

25:00.912 --> 25:02.432
A murderous one?

25:03.275 --> 25:04.952
It's been known to happen.

25:14.610 --> 25:16.645
Is it too austere for you?

25:17.060 --> 25:18.529
Excuse me?

25:18.960 --> 25:20.311
The house.

25:21.642 --> 25:23.291
The house is fine.

25:24.423 --> 25:25.778
"Fine"?

25:26.105 --> 25:29.131
I was hoping for more than fine.

25:29.803 --> 25:32.110
It'll just take some getting used to.

25:32.235 --> 25:33.897
So, you don't like it.

25:34.132 --> 25:35.426
I knew it.

25:35.628 --> 25:36.840
What?

25:37.253 --> 25:40.891
I'm sorry, Julia. I'm just preoccupied.

25:42.839 --> 25:44.151
With what?

25:44.976 --> 25:47.979
Well, you know what's curious?

25:48.481 --> 25:51.005
No one mentioned seeing Mr. Spoud.

25:51.032 --> 25:54.215
All of those guests at the
party, and no one saw him.

25:54.754 --> 25:58.047
Which is odd, considering
where he ended up.

25:59.337 --> 26:01.902
And time of death is
impossible to ascertain,

26:02.542 --> 26:04.757
which means he could
have been placed inside

26:04.767 --> 26:07.374
hours before his death. Or days, even.

26:08.309 --> 26:10.534
In fact, he could have been dead

26:10.621 --> 26:12.179
when he was placed in there.

26:12.676 --> 26:15.135
Well, the total destruction
of the body is the perfect way

26:15.150 --> 26:17.628
to hide both cause
and the time of death.

26:18.502 --> 26:20.020
Well, one thing is certain:

26:20.202 --> 26:21.602
it wasn't self-inflicted.

26:21.625 --> 26:24.358
It's impossible to turn
the machine on from inside.

26:24.941 --> 26:27.884
So, it was turned on while
the party was underway.

26:28.832 --> 26:31.265
Meaning the killer
was one of our guests.

26:38.266 --> 26:41.476
Oh, Constable, Constable!
I have wonderful news.

26:41.676 --> 26:43.857
What, you're planning on
cancelling the whole endeavour?

26:43.881 --> 26:46.419
The wedding? No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:46.448 --> 26:48.750
I have found you a perfect partner.

26:48.778 --> 26:51.657
I just have to arrange for you
two to meet before the blessed day.

26:51.726 --> 26:55.204
- Miss Newsome.
- Oh! Inspector, what a delight.

26:55.254 --> 26:56.705
Where's Higgins?

26:56.774 --> 26:58.594
He had some personal
business to attend to.

26:58.608 --> 27:00.662
- Oh, did he?
- Terribly important, he said.

27:00.731 --> 27:02.121
Of course.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.632
Do you suppose that, if
it's not too much trouble,

27:04.633 --> 27:06.985
he may deign to grace us
with an appearance tomorrow?

27:07.234 --> 27:09.671
Yes, I would imagine
it is quite difficult

27:09.680 --> 27:12.439
to keep the Station running
in fine form without my Henry.

27:13.308 --> 27:15.628
Well, I will let you know when
I have arranged the meeting.

27:16.265 --> 27:18.186
- Oh, Miss Newsome?
- Hmm?

27:18.311 --> 27:19.911
You don't have a picture of her, do you?

27:20.314 --> 27:22.377
Singing a different
tune are we, Constable?

27:22.502 --> 27:24.451
I assure you, she is a handsome woman.

27:25.007 --> 27:27.384
"Handsome" is never
a good sign, Crabtree.

27:31.022 --> 27:32.796
Ah, Watts!

27:33.690 --> 27:36.564
I suppose there is a
certain ingenuity to this:

27:36.598 --> 27:40.575
a harmony of natural
and man-made materials.

27:40.972 --> 27:44.038
I believe he calls his style organic.

27:44.439 --> 27:48.179
It certainly appears function
and form are coalescing.

27:49.188 --> 27:50.538
Hmm.

27:51.095 --> 27:53.678
Were you able to find
anything out about Miss Ryand?

27:53.936 --> 27:56.272
If I were to jump to
conclusions, I would say

27:56.295 --> 27:58.814
I have found a very viable suspect.

27:58.939 --> 28:01.388
This is interesting.

28:03.661 --> 28:06.103
- To the point...
- Oh. Of course.

28:06.114 --> 28:09.573
Miss Ryand has been in the employ
of Mr. Wright for about a year.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.949
She arrived from England some time ago.

28:11.967 --> 28:14.666
There are rumours she and Mr.
Wright are having an affair.

28:14.731 --> 28:16.136
No great surprise there, though.

28:16.171 --> 28:18.263
Apparently, this is
the norm for Mr. Wright.

28:18.290 --> 28:21.238
- I see.
- But before she met Mr. Wright,

28:21.270 --> 28:24.817
she was employed at another
architectural firm in this city.

28:24.849 --> 28:26.977
- Mr. Spoud's?
- Exactly.

28:26.991 --> 28:29.312
Apparently, she is a
very skilled draftsman.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.199
- Why did she leave Spoud's?
- He fired her.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.717
That doesn't make her a killer.

28:36.759 --> 28:38.192
Not in itself, no.

28:38.226 --> 28:40.351
But I talked to some of
the people at Spoud's firm.

28:40.362 --> 28:43.717
They intimated that she had launched
numerous complaints against him.

28:43.759 --> 28:47.460
He was... insistent in
his attempts to woo her.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.661
And when she declined, he fired her.

28:50.702 --> 28:53.963
Ended her career until Mr.
Wright came to the rescue.

28:55.350 --> 28:58.224
Well, it is the closest
thing we have to motive.

29:01.191 --> 29:02.554
You...

29:02.679 --> 29:04.281
you like this place?

29:04.493 --> 29:08.878
Oh, I very much do. The
light is, uh, pleasing.

29:11.142 --> 29:12.474
You don't?

29:13.404 --> 29:15.472
It suits Julia's needs.

29:24.757 --> 29:27.354
I just don't know if I'm
comfortable with the idea, sir.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.477
In fact, I reckon I am
uncomfortable with the idea.

29:30.528 --> 29:32.491
You don't trust Miss Newsome's judgment?

29:32.518 --> 29:34.591
Well sir, we all know who she's decided

29:34.619 --> 29:36.111
to spend the rest of her life with.

29:37.313 --> 29:39.776
- Mr. Towne.
- I've given your device

29:39.790 --> 29:42.212
a proper going over. All
appears in working order.

29:42.231 --> 29:44.626
Excellent. You stated that a number

29:44.635 --> 29:48.274
of rival architects visited
my home during construction.

29:48.334 --> 29:51.912
Do you recall if Mr.
Spoud was among them?

29:52.488 --> 29:53.809
I believe he was.

29:53.934 --> 29:55.799
Oh. When?

29:55.840 --> 29:57.927
Right before your party. I remember

29:57.941 --> 29:59.921
because he came with a camera.

30:00.046 --> 30:03.163
We were talking about beginning
work at the Ferguson place.

30:03.288 --> 30:05.309
And you saw him leave?

30:05.434 --> 30:06.794
I did not.

30:07.310 --> 30:09.101
Ms. Ryand had dismissed me.

30:09.995 --> 30:12.624
- Mr. Wright's assistant?
- The one and the same.

30:12.657 --> 30:14.499
They were arguing something fierce.

30:15.328 --> 30:19.075
- George?
- Sir, right away. Mr. Towne.

30:21.079 --> 30:23.325
- So, you deny none of it?
- No.

30:23.750 --> 30:26.152
You saw Mr. Spoud the day that he died?

30:26.277 --> 30:29.181
I saw Mr. Spoud taking
photographs of Mr. Wright's work

30:29.200 --> 30:31.129
and I put a stop to it. Nothing more.

30:32.359 --> 30:35.787
Why did you not reveal that you had
worked with Mr. Spoud in the past?

30:35.912 --> 30:38.118
It's a part of my life
I choose to forget.

30:38.147 --> 30:40.064
Unfortunately, I can't.

30:40.087 --> 30:42.384
Your connection does provide motive.

30:43.446 --> 30:46.040
I worked with Mr. Spoud
for a number of years.

30:46.350 --> 30:48.204
I was a very good employee.

30:48.279 --> 30:49.810
Regardless,

30:49.833 --> 30:52.809
he made it clear that if
I was going to progress,

30:52.838 --> 30:54.732
I would have to grant him favours

30:55.204 --> 30:57.058
of an intimate nature.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.821
That was something I
was not prepared to do.

30:59.850 --> 31:02.322
If I had wished to kill him,
I would have done it back then.

31:03.915 --> 31:05.913
A witness stated that they saw you

31:05.923 --> 31:08.189
with Mr. Spoud on the day of his death.

31:08.263 --> 31:10.501
I imagine a lot of
people were seen with him.

31:10.681 --> 31:12.108
I've got work to do.

31:12.173 --> 31:15.167
Work you and Mr. Wright
desperately needed.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.373
And work that you
would not have obtained

31:17.378 --> 31:19.141
were it not for the death of Mr. Spoud.

31:19.146 --> 31:20.716
Now, can you account
for your whereabouts

31:20.725 --> 31:22.853
in the hours preceding the party?

31:23.401 --> 31:26.132
I went back to my hotel and
permitted myself a drink.

31:26.708 --> 31:28.486
- Alone?
- Yes.

31:28.914 --> 31:31.360
- Where was Mr. Wright?
- I don't know where he was.

31:31.798 --> 31:33.631
I was at the Scarborough Bluffs.

31:35.113 --> 31:36.468
For what purpose?

31:36.675 --> 31:38.264
Taking it in.

31:38.301 --> 31:41.128
My inspiration is taken
from the world around me.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.993
A number of people
would have seen me there.

31:44.030 --> 31:45.255
Oh.

31:45.380 --> 31:47.839
Are you able to provide
me with any names?

31:49.146 --> 31:50.924
There was a constable.

31:50.989 --> 31:54.185
He warned me not to get
too close to the edge.

31:56.013 --> 31:57.446
Morning.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.767
Ah, Constable Higgins!

32:00.892 --> 32:03.083
- Nice to see you.
- Oh. Thank you, sir.

32:03.101 --> 32:04.487
Will you be staying long?

32:04.810 --> 32:06.289
I don't know yet, sir.

32:06.510 --> 32:09.195
- Why, did Ruth call? Does she need me?
- No.

32:09.320 --> 32:11.452
Now, get your good boots on.

32:11.577 --> 32:13.424
Two days foot patrol in the Ward.

32:13.447 --> 32:15.810
With extra hours to make up
for the time that you missed.

32:15.980 --> 32:17.509
Sir, I can't do that.

32:17.537 --> 32:18.707
I have things I need to take care of.

32:18.711 --> 32:20.935
You will do that, and you
will do whatever I tell you to.

32:20.959 --> 32:22.663
Sir, I'm getting married. I can't risk

32:22.667 --> 32:23.998
getting injured before the wedding.

32:24.012 --> 32:26.670
- You're risking getting injured right now.
- Higgins.

32:26.748 --> 32:28.582
Miss Newsome is on the telephone.

32:33.276 --> 32:35.150
Don't you bloody dare.

32:49.404 --> 32:51.108
- Roo-poo.
- Oh, boy.

32:52.854 --> 32:54.033
Goodbye, Roo-Poo!

32:55.147 --> 32:57.464
- Why did you do that?
- Because you're on the job

32:57.487 --> 32:58.847
and when you are you listen to me!

32:58.878 --> 33:01.972
And if you don't you'll be
working on your bloody wedding day!

33:02.097 --> 33:05.527
Well, we won't have to
worry about that anymore.

33:06.222 --> 33:08.019
From this day forward,

33:08.051 --> 33:11.054
Henry Hieronymus Higgins
listens to no man!

33:11.082 --> 33:12.864
- I resign.
- You're fired.

33:12.878 --> 33:14.762
- I said it first.
- Get out!

33:17.414 --> 33:19.081
You know, you were lucky to have me.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.920
I gave the best 10 years
of my life to this place,

33:20.934 --> 33:22.647
and what'd I get in return? Nothing!

33:22.665 --> 33:24.834
You received payment when
you didn't even deserve it!

33:24.835 --> 33:28.362
Oh, I deserved it, being
bossed around for no reason.

33:28.376 --> 33:31.642
Day in, day out, listening
to you prattle on and on. No.

33:32.638 --> 33:35.184
Oh! And as for your wife,

33:35.212 --> 33:37.156
I wouldn't trust her
to plan afternoon tea!

33:37.160 --> 33:39.103
- WHY YOU LITTLE...
- Perhaps a drink is in order.

33:39.127 --> 33:40.578
Let's get a move on.

33:41.365 --> 33:42.600
Go.

33:42.775 --> 33:44.050
I shall, George,

33:44.175 --> 33:46.252
but I want you to know
you're still the best friend

33:46.275 --> 33:47.781
I have in this world.

34:07.034 --> 34:09.857
Henry Higgins has been
there a long time, hasn't he?

34:10.572 --> 34:12.417
Well, yes. I suppose he has.

34:12.841 --> 34:14.697
Are we still going to his wedding?

34:15.415 --> 34:18.364
- We haven't been uninvited.
- Oh.

34:20.422 --> 34:23.351
I have received a request
from Mr. Spoud's wife.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.741
She'd like what's
left of his belongings.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.937
Oh, yes. She can have them.

34:28.550 --> 34:31.078
So, you think Miss Ryand is responsible?

34:31.856 --> 34:33.445
I don't know.

34:34.306 --> 34:37.617
Many women have to suffer
under unfortunate circumstances.

34:37.649 --> 34:39.245
It doesn't make them killers.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.471
Although, I do understand the impulse.

34:43.904 --> 34:48.351
She will be questioned again,
but I'm hesitant to arrest her.

34:53.456 --> 34:55.726
You don't like this house, do you?

34:57.697 --> 35:00.318
I didn't say that.

35:00.797 --> 35:02.317
William?

35:05.615 --> 35:10.759
It's just that so much of what's
here doesn't feel like ours.

35:11.233 --> 35:14.420
I feel as though I'm on display

35:15.015 --> 35:16.843
in someone else's home.

35:18.352 --> 35:19.477
Well...

35:19.882 --> 35:23.157
when you throw Mr. Wright in
jail we can do whatever we want.

35:25.488 --> 35:27.712
We can move if you want, William.

35:27.722 --> 35:29.762
I just thought this
place would suit you.

35:30.011 --> 35:33.530
- It's clean and modern and sophisticated...
- What?

35:33.581 --> 35:36.077
Oh!

35:43.141 --> 35:45.535
I discovered this as well.

35:47.641 --> 35:49.806
Oh!

35:50.133 --> 35:53.389
It creates the feeling of
an entirely different room.

35:53.398 --> 35:55.001
Mm-hmm.

35:56.235 --> 35:59.703
I was thinking, we have yet
to properly christen the place.

36:00.541 --> 36:02.572
What if it pops back in again?

36:02.618 --> 36:05.146
I think that's the idea, William.

36:15.066 --> 36:17.244
- Doctor.
- Miss Hart.

36:17.263 --> 36:18.985
Could you gather Mr. Spoud's effects?

36:19.003 --> 36:20.753
His wife has requested them.

36:21.508 --> 36:23.074
She could have asked me.

36:23.259 --> 36:25.630
All official requests
still come through me.

36:25.755 --> 36:27.565
- Of course.
- Thank you.

36:28.490 --> 36:29.761
How curious...

36:34.644 --> 36:37.522
Not something Mr. Spoud
likely had in his possession.

36:37.546 --> 36:40.148
I thought the same. When I
was gathering his belongings...

36:40.153 --> 36:41.548
I missed them.

36:41.953 --> 36:44.168
Oh, you wouldn't have
known what they were.

36:44.196 --> 36:46.656
Besides, cataloging
evidence isn't your job.

36:46.781 --> 36:49.096
Yes, but Doctor Ogden found them.

36:49.699 --> 36:52.518
Yes, well, Doctor Ogden
has years of experience.

36:52.554 --> 36:56.234
- Miss Hart, it was a totally understandable oversight...
- I made a mistake.

36:57.072 --> 36:58.748
It won't happen again.

37:07.758 --> 37:09.662
Ah, Mr. Towne!

37:09.890 --> 37:11.598
Please, come in.

37:11.916 --> 37:13.381
Something else for me, sir?

37:14.381 --> 37:15.781
Yes.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.253
Do you... recognize these?

37:22.137 --> 37:23.619
Electrical straps.

37:24.167 --> 37:25.982
Used to insulate wire.

37:26.162 --> 37:27.442
Indeed.

37:27.567 --> 37:32.315
Do you have any idea why they would
have been found inside of my device?

37:32.799 --> 37:34.871
I left them there by mistake.

37:34.996 --> 37:40.427
And why I found human
skin in the fibres?

37:41.561 --> 37:45.777
Mr. Spoud's body exploded.

37:46.218 --> 37:49.566
- He could have contaminated...
- Well, that's one explanation.

37:49.624 --> 37:51.150
But I believe there is another.

37:51.224 --> 37:53.206
You bound Mr. Spoud with these

37:53.239 --> 37:54.886
and placed him inside.

37:56.595 --> 37:59.712
I wasn't even at your
home when it happened.

38:00.633 --> 38:01.789
But you were,

38:02.171 --> 38:03.332
however briefly.

38:03.921 --> 38:05.943
Mr. Wright asked you to leave.

38:05.994 --> 38:08.310
And you yourself admitted that you

38:08.328 --> 38:10.701
and Mr. Spoud were at my
house before the party.

38:10.737 --> 38:12.493
This isn't funny, Spoud.

38:12.502 --> 38:13.662
You owe me money!

38:13.685 --> 38:15.159
I looked into it.

38:15.284 --> 38:17.006
You two had a history.

38:17.268 --> 38:19.626
He didn't pay you for
your last job with him.

38:20.082 --> 38:21.620
You confronted him.

38:22.917 --> 38:26.247
You bound him and placed him the room.

38:26.315 --> 38:27.900
Closed the door.

38:28.360 --> 38:32.068
And you were at the party long
enough to turn on the device.

38:32.413 --> 38:34.878
Before Mr. Wright escorted you out.

38:36.361 --> 38:38.599
Leaving me with a room full of suspects.

38:38.645 --> 38:41.008
But only one killer.

38:42.832 --> 38:44.557
Do you deny any of this?

38:48.031 --> 38:49.459
Where's your proof?

38:50.702 --> 38:53.039
Well, these are certainly a good start.

38:53.558 --> 38:55.490
And now that I know what I'm looking at,

38:55.536 --> 38:57.245
I believe I'll find what I need.

39:04.246 --> 39:05.411
I didn't...

39:05.881 --> 39:07.714
just work for Spoud.

39:09.312 --> 39:12.256
I designed his buildings
with him, but he took credit

39:12.845 --> 39:14.305
for everything.

39:14.968 --> 39:16.815
He was the architect,

39:17.036 --> 39:19.155
and I was nothing more than a labourer.

39:19.804 --> 39:21.435
He made that clear.

39:22.066 --> 39:25.060
- You were jealous.
- I was cheated!

39:26.154 --> 39:28.015
And I tolerated it

39:28.140 --> 39:29.949
because he paid me well.

39:32.130 --> 39:33.886
And then he didn't.

39:35.867 --> 39:38.054
The day I took that job

39:38.438 --> 39:40.406
for Mr. Wright,

39:40.440 --> 39:42.241
Spoud turned on me.

39:43.363 --> 39:46.224
He reneged all monies that he owed me,

39:46.246 --> 39:49.512
and he vowed I would never work again.

39:52.655 --> 39:54.787
He took my livelihood.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.758
I took his life.

40:03.191 --> 40:04.659
She should be here.

40:04.711 --> 40:06.765
Punctuality is one of her virtues,

40:06.794 --> 40:09.149
and one of the qualities
you said you admired.

40:09.161 --> 40:11.648
Are you nervous? I have to
admit, I'm a little nervous too.

40:11.688 --> 40:13.692
- I know I shouldn't be but just, ooh!
- I'm fine.

40:13.817 --> 40:16.017
And you say she would like to
have children at some point?

40:16.041 --> 40:17.953
A passel. George,

40:17.994 --> 40:20.746
I am delivering to you
the woman of your dreams.

40:20.780 --> 40:23.187
She is both confident in
her career and yet possesses

40:23.216 --> 40:25.248
a keen nurturing spirit.

40:25.962 --> 40:28.654
I have to admit, I am
getting a little excited.

40:34.350 --> 40:36.802
- Louise.
- George.

40:37.608 --> 40:39.508
Oh, you two know each other then.

40:40.095 --> 40:42.167
- Ugh!
- Um...

40:45.605 --> 40:47.582
And you are going to be a surgeon?

40:48.230 --> 40:50.562
Yes, I'm almost there.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.642
Much to the dismay of certain
male students in my class.

40:53.682 --> 40:55.933
Things would be easier
if men weren't in the way.

40:56.262 --> 41:00.490
Julia, it would appear we are
to be the only people in Toronto

41:00.542 --> 41:02.355
with a home designed by Mr. Wright.

41:02.401 --> 41:04.319
- Oh?
- I decided the Fergusons

41:04.347 --> 41:06.397
weren't deserving of my abilities.

41:06.432 --> 41:08.494
I'm going back home to Chicago.

41:08.844 --> 41:11.291
Oak Park has commissioned
me to build a new church.

41:11.326 --> 41:14.417
The first building to be
constructed entirely out of concrete.

41:14.446 --> 41:18.504
Oh... Well, I expect that
will raise a few eyebrows.

41:18.538 --> 41:21.671
I hope it does. It's time
we cast aside the trappings

41:21.708 --> 41:23.841
of the last century, wouldn't you say?

41:23.966 --> 41:25.620
And the Fergusons?

41:25.966 --> 41:30.370
Someone will create another uninspiring
piece of Toronto architecture.

41:30.554 --> 41:32.742
- Ah.
- I'm sure they will.

41:33.484 --> 41:35.908
And how have you settled in?

41:35.966 --> 41:39.416
Oh... William rather
likes the hidden sofa.

41:39.426 --> 41:41.500
Good! I think you will find
as you explore the place

41:41.517 --> 41:43.829
there will be a few more surprises.

41:43.863 --> 41:45.783
And Dr. Ogden...

41:46.132 --> 41:48.230
I do like the statue.

41:48.355 --> 41:51.684
Oh! Everyone loves Apu.

41:56.421 --> 41:58.470
George, take a look at this.

42:06.459 --> 42:08.344
That is quite something, sir!

42:08.384 --> 42:10.675
He does it every hour on the hour.

42:10.693 --> 42:12.610
I'm sure he'll eventually break it.

42:12.735 --> 42:14.608
I'm sure that's not what will break it.

42:14.677 --> 42:17.763
And George... recessed lighting.

42:17.888 --> 42:21.824
No need to clutter the
space with unnecessary lamps.

42:21.949 --> 42:24.219
So you are taking to
the house then, sir?

42:24.460 --> 42:27.276
Oh... yes, I'm quite taken.

42:27.345 --> 42:30.046
Sir?

42:30.247 --> 42:32.872
It's OK, George. I'll get it.

42:33.598 --> 42:35.946
Sir, it's not been in there 10 minutes!

42:35.947 --> 42:37.805
It can't possibly be ready.

42:39.425 --> 42:41.742
Our first ever dinner guest!

42:45.747 --> 42:47.768
Well, look at that!

42:48.165 --> 42:51.153
Cooked right through, and piping hot!

42:51.758 --> 42:54.584
- Very, very hot.
- Oh, George...

42:57.526 --> 42:59.132
Mm!

42:59.361 --> 43:01.562
- Well, cheers!
- Cheers!

43:01.568 --> 43:03.335
Cheers!

43:07.169 --> 43:09.496
Miss Hart. Can I help you?

43:09.916 --> 43:12.605
Could you tell me if there
are any specific files

43:12.628 --> 43:14.909
or manuals relating to
investigative techniques?

43:14.943 --> 43:17.320
Planning a change in career?

43:17.654 --> 43:20.021
I am planning on mastering
whatever needs be mastered

43:20.061 --> 43:23.618
- to get to where I want to go.
- An admirable pursuit.

43:24.131 --> 43:26.302
My colour makes it a necessary one.

43:26.722 --> 43:29.255
Now, are you going to help me or not?

43:29.992 --> 43:31.938
Pull up a chair.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.236
All right.

43:35.449 --> 43:37.021
This.

43:37.367 --> 43:39.117
And this.
