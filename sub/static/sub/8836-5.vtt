19:49.523 --> 19:50.732
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:52.484 --> 19:55.696
I--

19:55.863 --> 19:58.156
I CAME BACK TO
TELL YOU I'M SORRY

19:58.323 --> 20:01.910
FOR ALL THE BAD
THINGS I SAID
TO YOU YESTERDAY.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.745
NOBODY ASKED YOU'.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.170
BET YOU NEVER TALK
TO HER THAT WAY.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.380
WHAT?

20:13.547 --> 20:15.966
JUST THAT IF
I WAS AS BEAUTIFUL
AS SHE IS,

20:16.133 --> 20:17.718
YOU WOULDN'T BE
ACTING THIS WAY.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.682
IT'S NONE
OF YOUR AFFAIR.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.520
DON'T YOU GO TALKING'.

20:28.687 --> 20:31.523
I WON'T...

20:31.690 --> 20:34.401
BUT SHE SURE WILL
WHEN SHE GETS BACK,

20:34.568 --> 20:37.070
THE WAY YOU LET
HER HOUSE GO.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.071
WHAT?

20:38.238 --> 20:39.114
WELL, LOOK
AT THIS PLACE.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.034
IT'S A MESS'.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.911
WELL, I...

20:44.077 --> 20:45.829
I'VE, UH...

20:45.996 --> 20:47.205
I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO--

20:47.372 --> 20:49.333
MEANING WON'T
MAKE IT FIT
FOR WOOLLY BEARS.

20:52.628 --> 20:55.380
HAVE TO CLEAN
YOUR BROOM BEFORE
YOU CAN EVEN SWEEP.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.883
YOU'RE A REGULAR
SNIPPETY-SNAP,

20:58.050 --> 20:59.217
AIN'T YOU?

20:59.384 --> 21:00.761
WHAT'S
A SNIPPETY-SNAP?

21:00.928 --> 21:02.054
PEOPLE LIKE YOU'.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.184
WELL, I...

21:07.351 --> 21:11.855
GUESS I HAVE LET
THE PLACE GO
A LITTLE.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.899
WELL, WE COULD
FIX IT UP.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.568
IT COULD ALL LOOK
JUST LIKE HER ROOM
UPSTAIRS...

21:16.735 --> 21:19.112
IF WE DID IT TOGETHER.

21:19.279 --> 21:22.157
YOU WERE UPSTAIRS?

21:22.324 --> 21:23.575
HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS HER ROOM?

21:25.410 --> 21:28.080
WELL, IT HAS
TO BE HER ROOM.

21:28.246 --> 21:31.249
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.919
WHAT'S HER NAME?

21:34.086 --> 21:36.213
MISS LILLY...

21:36.380 --> 21:38.882
MISS LILLY BALDWIN.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.762
BET YOU COULD
GET THIS PLACE FIXED UP

21:43.929 --> 21:45.973
IN A JIFFY FOR MISS LILLY,

21:46.139 --> 21:48.767
WITH ME HELPING.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.185
I DIDN'T ASK YOU.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.895
DIDN'T ASK ME
TO LEAVE EITHER.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.691
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS?

21:55.857 --> 21:56.942
LAURA INGALLS.

21:57.109 --> 21:58.777
I ALREADY KNOW YOURS.

21:58.944 --> 22:00.904
WELL, BETTER START
CLEANING UP.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.156
YOU TAKE THAT RUG OUTSIDE
AND GIVE IT A GOOD SHAKING,

22:03.323 --> 22:05.075
AND I'LL SEE WHAT
I CAN DO IN HERE.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.915
YOU'RE A REAL
SNIPPETY-SNAP.
YES, SIR.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.669
DID YOU REALLY
CHASE KIDS AWAY

22:15.836 --> 22:18.630
WITH YOUR BIG STICK
LIKE EVERYBODY SAYS?

22:18.797 --> 22:20.090
THAT WHAT THEY SAY?

22:20.257 --> 22:21.383
SOME OF THEM DO.

22:22.968 --> 22:25.220
WELL, IT WASN'T
OUT OF MEANNESS.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.140
IT WAS
JUST PROTECTING
WHAT WAS MINE.

22:28.306 --> 22:29.975
AND MISS LILLY'S.

22:30.142 --> 22:33.020
WHEN WILL MISS LILLY
BE COMING BACK?

22:33.186 --> 22:35.522
WELL, MOST ANYTIME
NOW,

22:35.689 --> 22:39.526
SOON AS SHE GETS
TIRED OF
CITY LIVING.

22:39.693 --> 22:40.569
HOW COME YOU NEVER
WENT TO LIVE IN

22:40.736 --> 22:43.196
THE CITY WITH
MISS LILLY? HMM?

22:43.363 --> 22:44.489
WHO ARE YOU
COMING AROUND HERE

22:44.656 --> 22:46.783
TELLING ME WHAT I
SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T DO?

22:46.950 --> 22:49.327
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

22:49.494 --> 22:50.537
BUT IF YOU WENT
TO THE CITY,

22:50.704 --> 22:53.248
YOU'D SEE MISS LILLY
A WHOLE LOT MORE.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.959
WELL, I AIN'T
A CITY MAN.

22:56.126 --> 22:59.337
GO CRAZY IN THOSE
STACKED HOUSES.
ALL THAT NOISE.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.423
PEOPLE RUNNING
HERE AND YON.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.842
FELLA COULD GET
RUN DOWN IN THE STREET.

23:04.009 --> 23:08.430
I NEED A FAT SUN
AND GOOD, CLEAN WIND
IN MY FACE.

23:08.597 --> 23:09.931
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING EITHER OF THEM

23:10.098 --> 23:13.852
STAYING LOCKED UP
IN THIS OLD HOUSE
ALL THE TIME.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.438
LISTEN HERE,
YOU RUNNY-NOSED
LITTLE UPSTART.

23:16.605 --> 23:19.399
THE WINDOWS
ARE LOOKING
A LOT NICER.

23:19.566 --> 23:20.358
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING

23:20.525 --> 23:21.693
A LADY COULD
APPRECIATE MORE

23:21.860 --> 23:24.029
THAN
CLEAN WINDOWS...

23:24.196 --> 23:27.157
EXCEPT MAYBE
A CLEAN YARD
WITH FLOWERS.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.243
YOU LET THAT YARD GO.

23:34.664 --> 23:35.957
WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

23:37.626 --> 23:40.212
LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S COMING.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.679
OH, THAT'S
JUST MY PA.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.473
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW LATE IT WAS.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.724
WHOA.

24:01.775 --> 24:02.526
HI, PA'.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.820
HI, HALF-PINT,
MR. PIKE.

24:04.986 --> 24:08.156
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU CAME
FOR THIS SNIPPETY-SNAP.

24:08.323 --> 24:11.409
I'LL THANK YOU TO TAKE
MISS LAURA INGALLS
FROM OVER THE HILL

24:11.576 --> 24:13.078
BACK OVER THE HILL.

24:13.245 --> 24:15.247
I'M SORRY
IF SHE CAUSED YOU
ANY TROUBLE, SIR.

24:15.413 --> 24:18.125
TIME WAS WHEN DECENT FOLKS
KEPT THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME

24:18.291 --> 24:20.001
OUT OF OTHER FOLKS'
BUSINESS.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.464
[DOOR SLAMS SHUT]

24:24.631 --> 24:26.258
WELL, I SUPPOSE
YOU HEARD THAT.

24:26.424 --> 24:27.926
I SURE DID.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.594
THAT'S JUST
THE WAY HE IS.

24:29.761 --> 24:31.012
HE REALLY LIKES ME.

24:38.228 --> 24:41.439
WELL, THIS HOUSE
IS LOOKING BETTER,

24:41.606 --> 24:44.609
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THERE'S
STILL A LONG WAY TO GO.

24:44.776 --> 24:48.488
Pike: YEAH, WELL,
WE'RE GETTING THERE.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.323
WOO'.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.117
COBWEBS COULDN'T
WEIGH MORE THAN AIR,

24:52.284 --> 24:57.289
BUT BET I'VE CLEARED
A TON OF THEM OUT
OF THIS ROOM ALONE.

24:57.455 --> 24:58.748
A LOT OF THEM
ANYWAY.

25:03.461 --> 25:04.754
THERE.
THAT'S FINISHED.

25:10.302 --> 25:13.138
COULD POLISH FURNITURE
IF YOU HAD SOME
FURNITURE POLISH.

25:13.305 --> 25:14.472
WELL, USE YOUR EYES,
CHILD.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.183
THERE'S A BOTTLE
RIGHT THERE
ON THE TABLE.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.315
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE LAST DAY

25:23.481 --> 25:24.816
I'LL BE ABLE TO HELP
YOU FOR A WHILE.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.151
HUH?

25:26.318 --> 25:28.278
MY PA'S GOING
TO TAKE ME TO
MANKATO WITH HIM.

25:28.445 --> 25:31.072
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?

25:31.239 --> 25:34.159
WELL, MISS BEADLE
FEELS THAT GEOGRAPHY
IS IMPORTANT

25:34.326 --> 25:35.660
AND THE BEST WAY
TO LEARN IT

25:35.827 --> 25:39.039
IS TO SEE IT AND
THEN WRITE ABOUT IT
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

25:39.206 --> 25:40.707
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO MANKATO?

25:40.874 --> 25:42.250
LOTS OF TIMES.

25:42.417 --> 25:45.837
IT'S WHERE I MET
AND MARRIED MISS LILLY.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.714
SHE WAS IN
A REPERTORY COMPANY.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.674
A REPER WHAT?

25:49.841 --> 25:51.593
A REPERTORY COMPANY.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.553
MEANS THE SAME
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES

25:53.720 --> 25:55.013
DOING
DIFFERENT PLAYS,

25:55.180 --> 25:56.848
DIFFERENT PLAY
EVERY NIGHT.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.309
FIRST TIME
I SAW HER,
SHE WAS A SINGER

25:59.476 --> 26:02.312
WHO HAD
A BROKEN HEART,
A LOT OF SAD SONGS.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.439
HAD EVERYBODY IN
THE THEATER CRYING,

26:04.606 --> 26:07.525
WHOLE OCEAN
OF TEARS.

26:07.692 --> 26:09.611
I DON'T THINK
I'D LIKE THAT.

26:09.778 --> 26:12.113
YES, YOU WOULD.
EVERYBODY DID.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.866
NEXT NIGHT,
SHE WAS A DANCER,

26:15.033 --> 26:16.159
A GYPSY...

26:16.326 --> 26:18.828
WHIRLING
AROUND THE STAGE,

26:18.995 --> 26:21.623
SPARKLES
IN HER HAIR,

26:21.790 --> 26:23.541
LIGHTER THAN
THISTLEDOWN.

26:23.708 --> 26:26.086
TOOK MY BREATH AWAY
JUST TO WATCH HER.

26:26.253 --> 26:27.379
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

26:32.217 --> 26:35.512
YES, CHILD.

26:35.679 --> 26:40.433
ARTIST DIDN'T PAINT HER
AS PRETTY AS SHE IS.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.769
DID YOU SEE
ALL HER PLAYS?

26:42.936 --> 26:45.105
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

26:45.272 --> 26:47.482
NOT JUST ONCE.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.234
THE THEATER WAS
MY COURTING PLACE.

26:49.401 --> 26:50.902
I SAT RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE FRONT ROW

26:51.069 --> 26:51.903
EVERY NIGHT,

26:52.070 --> 26:54.406
WHERE SHE COULD
SEE ME.

26:54.572 --> 26:57.575
AFTER,
I WENT BACKSTAGE.

26:57.742 --> 27:01.329
WAS 4 DAYS BEFORE
SHE EVEN SAID HELLO.

27:01.496 --> 27:03.498
OH. THEN WHAT?

27:09.963 --> 27:13.008
THEN IT WAS
THE WONDER,
THE GLORY,

27:13.174 --> 27:16.928
SUNSHINE,
AND LIGHTNING ALL
AT THE SAME TIME.

27:17.095 --> 27:18.430
I CAME HERE,
BUILT THIS HOUSE,

27:18.596 --> 27:20.390
WENT BACK AND ASKED
HER TO BE MY WIFE.

27:21.766 --> 27:23.768
WHEN SHE SAID YES,

27:23.935 --> 27:26.438
I WAS SO HAPPY
I WAS DUMBSTRUCK
FOR AN HOUR.

27:29.274 --> 27:30.567
WHY DID SHE GO AWAY?

27:33.111 --> 27:34.404
IT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS WHY.

27:40.452 --> 27:41.619
I'M SORRY.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.582
THERE WAS
NOTHING HERE
BUT THIS HOUSE--

27:45.749 --> 27:49.085
NO WALNUT GROVE,
NO PEOPLE...

27:49.252 --> 27:50.211
NO COMPANY
EXCEPT FOR THE BIRDS

27:50.378 --> 27:53.048
SINGING IN THE GROVE
DOWN THERE.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.635
SHE WASN'T
USED TO IT.

27:57.802 --> 27:58.636
SHE GOT
THE LONESOMES
SO BAD

27:58.803 --> 28:01.556
SHE COULDN'T
STAND IT.

28:01.723 --> 28:06.978
UH...SHE WENT AWAY
FOR A LITTLE...

28:07.145 --> 28:09.314
BACK ON THE STAGE
AGAIN.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.900
IN MANKATO?

28:12.067 --> 28:13.818
OHH...OTHER PLACES.

28:13.985 --> 28:17.614
MOSTLY MANKATO.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.074
UH, STANDING
AROUND HERE TALKING,

28:19.240 --> 28:21.451
THE SPIDERS WILL BE
GAINING ON ME.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.661
BE COBWEBS IN HERE
THICKER THAN BEFORE.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.672
YOU AND MA
WENT TO THE THEATER
IN MANKATO,

28:34.839 --> 28:35.757
DIDN'T YOU, PA?

28:35.924 --> 28:36.883
UH-HUH.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.426
DID YOU SEE
MISS LILLY?

28:38.593 --> 28:41.054
NO, HALF-PINT.
I DOUBT IF MISS LILLY
IS STILL ON THE STAGE.

28:41.221 --> 28:42.680
IT'S BEEN
A LOT OF YEARS NOW.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.516
SHE SURE LOOKS YOUNG
IN HER PICTURE.

28:44.682 --> 28:46.684
I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
HAVE THEIR PAINTINGS DONE,

28:46.851 --> 28:48.728
SO THEY CAN REMEMBER
HOW THEY LOOKED YEARS BACK.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.481
DO YOU SUPPOSE
SHE'S AS OLD
AS MR. PIKE IS?

28:51.648 --> 28:53.983
HMM, PRETTY NEAR,
I GUESS.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.653
I BET IF SHE KNEW
HOW MUCH THAT
HE LOVED HER,

28:56.820 --> 28:57.654
SHE'D COME BACK.

28:57.821 --> 28:59.072
WELL, MAYBE.

28:59.239 --> 29:02.367
NOW, DON'T FORGET,
A LONG, LONG TIME'S
GONE BY.

29:02.534 --> 29:05.286
I STILL THINK
THAT SHE'D COME BACK
IF SHE KNEW.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.580
WELL, MAYBE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:23.221 --> 29:24.597
CAN I GO
FOR A WALK, PA?

29:24.764 --> 29:26.099
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
JUST DON'T GET LOST.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.392
I WON'T.

30:08.433 --> 30:09.976
WELL...

30:10.143 --> 30:12.103
WHERE'D YOU COME
FROM, LITTLE LADY?

30:12.270 --> 30:15.690
I'M LAURA INGALLS
FROM WALNUT GROVE.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.902
YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM HOME.

30:19.068 --> 30:21.863
YOU COME IN HERE
BACKSTAGE...

30:22.030 --> 30:24.115
I BET YOU WANT TO
BECOME AN ACTRESS.

30:24.282 --> 30:25.283
NO, SIR.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.911
I'M LOOKING FOR A LADY
WHO WAS IN A REPER--

30:28.077 --> 30:29.996
REPERTORY COMPANY.

30:30.163 --> 30:31.706
YES. WE'VE HAD
A LOT OF THOSE.

30:31.873 --> 30:34.292
THEY COME AND GO,
COME AND GO.

30:34.459 --> 30:37.170
WELL, THIS LADY'S NAME
WAS MISS LILLY BALDWIN.

30:37.337 --> 30:38.463
DO YOU KNOW HER?

30:38.630 --> 30:42.050
I DID. YES, INDEEDY.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.969
NO WAY
TO FORGET A WOMAN
LIKE MISS LILLY.

30:45.136 --> 30:46.471
WELL, WHEN
WILL SHE BE BACK?

30:48.014 --> 30:49.641
WELL, SHE...

30:49.807 --> 30:53.144
SHE WON'T,
LITTLE LADY.

30:53.311 --> 30:55.605
SHE GOT THE CHOLERA,
DIED...

30:57.106 --> 30:59.484
MORE THAN
20 YEARS AGO.

30:59.651 --> 31:01.110
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.241
NO.

31:06.407 --> 31:09.661
WE ALL KNEW AND
LOVED MISS LILLY.

31:09.827 --> 31:12.247
WE WERE VERY SAD
WHEN SHE PASSED ON.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.544
THANK YOU.

31:17.710 --> 31:18.920
I'M SORRY.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.509
I WISH SHE WERE HERE,
MYSELF.

31:31.391 --> 31:33.726
I GOT THE HORSES
TAKEN CARE OF.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.770
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR PA
TO PUT ON A FEED BAG.

31:43.778 --> 31:45.738
I WONDER WHAT
IT WILL DO TO MR. PIKE

31:45.905 --> 31:47.115
WHEN HE FINDS OUT.

31:49.701 --> 31:52.036
IT'S ONE
OF THE FACTS
OF LIFE, HALF-PINT.

31:52.203 --> 31:53.246
IT'S GOING TO COME
TO ALL OF US

31:53.413 --> 31:54.914
