WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:12.345
[theme music playing]

01:07.317 --> 01:08.651
[Iverson] Who's a good girl?

01:08.735 --> 01:10.987
-[panting]
-You are. [laughs]

01:11.071 --> 01:13.156
I used to have a dog like this years ago.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.742
Old Sally would follow me
just about everywhere I went.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.286
I couldn't turn around
without her being there,

01:18.369 --> 01:21.164
-smiling her big, drooly smile.
-[mice squeaking]

01:21.247 --> 01:23.208
Which actually was a problem sometimes.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.543
I once tripped over her,
slipped on her drool

01:25.627 --> 01:28.087
and went shoulder-first
into the refrigerator.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.257
Yeah, and that's where this clicking
came from.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.968
Is that why you were struggling
with the pull-ups?

01:34.719 --> 01:37.931
No, that's because I'm old and overweight.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.891
And watch your insubordination.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.184
Yes, sir!

01:42.060 --> 01:43.186
Was the dog all right?

01:43.603 --> 01:45.355
She was fine, thank goodness.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.982
Yeah, that dog meant the world to me.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.151
[Veronica] I know how you feel.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.988
My brothers and sisters adopted
every stray animal they could find.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.782
There was this one cat.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.200
"Flash" we called him.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.410
He hated everybody except me.

01:59.869 --> 02:00.870
Smart cat.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.750
What about you, Acxa?
Did you have pets where you're from?

02:06.543 --> 02:08.545
I never had a creature companion,

02:08.628 --> 02:12.799
but one of my partners, Narti, was bonded
to an immortal cat named Kova.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.302
That cat gave her the ability
to experience the world.

02:17.804 --> 02:18.638
Oh.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.223
That's great.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.767
Until Lotor killed Narti

02:22.851 --> 02:25.145
and we had to abandon the animal
on our destroyed ship

02:25.228 --> 02:27.147
so we could escape without being tracked.

02:29.107 --> 02:29.941
[signal blares]

02:30.024 --> 02:31.901
[Shiro] Crew, report to the bridge
immediately.

02:31.985 --> 02:32.861
[door beeps]

02:34.821 --> 02:37.323
I've got an incoming transmission
from the Paladins.

02:37.740 --> 02:38.700
Go ahead, Allura.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.537
[Allura] Atlas, we've managed
to track down an Altean Robeast.

02:42.912 --> 02:43.997
You found one!

02:44.747 --> 02:46.791
Where is it?
Did you engage the creature?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.043
[Allura] Unfortunately, we were too late.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.380
It attacked the Olkari and stole
the remains of the weaponized cube.

02:52.463 --> 02:53.798
Is Olkarion okay?

02:54.507 --> 02:55.341
[Keith] No.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.051
Olkarion is gone.

02:57.927 --> 02:58.761
No.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.307
The loss of Olkarion
is devastating to us all,

03:02.891 --> 03:05.894
but we were able to acquire
some vital information.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.939
We learned from Olkarion that the Robeasts
have been traveling via wormhole,

03:10.023 --> 03:12.317
which leave behind
unique energy signatures.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.028
Pidge created a program
that can identify those signatures

03:15.111 --> 03:16.863
and pinpoint their exact locations.

03:17.822 --> 03:20.700
[Allura] We're sending over the readings
from Pidge's program now.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.828
Are you telling us these are all Robeasts?

03:24.203 --> 03:26.289
[Pidge] We're not positive,
but they could be.

03:26.664 --> 03:27.790
[Allura] There's more.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.042
After studying the map,

03:29.125 --> 03:33.755
we noticed the signatures all radiate
from a single epicenter: Oriande.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.758
Wait, so Honerva could be on Oriande?

03:37.133 --> 03:39.886
But I thought only worthy Alteans
could get there.

03:40.553 --> 03:44.140
-Could she have the mark of the chosen?
-[Keith] There's a lot we don't know.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.392
We need to rendezvous
to come up with a plan.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.728
[beeping]

03:48.811 --> 03:51.981
[Coran] The Baltuf Nebula would make
a good rendezvous point for both of us.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.900
Send us the coordinates, Coran.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.318
See you soon.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.872
[quiet chatter]

04:08.790 --> 04:10.667
Acxa! Come join us.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.760
So, how did you meet the Paladins?

04:21.803 --> 04:25.181
I met Keith when I was stuck
in the third stomach of a Weblum.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.766
He saved my life.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.228
What were you doing in a... stomach?

04:30.645 --> 04:33.773
Gathering scaultrite to help enable Lotor
to conquer the universe.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.860
I once got stuck in a ball pit
when I was a kid.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.699
Well, what do you think of the crew?

04:43.199 --> 04:44.993
It must be a pretty different dynamic

04:45.076 --> 04:47.453
being that we don't try
to kill each other, huh?

04:48.162 --> 04:50.707
I suppose,
but the Galra had an expression:

04:51.082 --> 04:54.335
"Combat is the searing light
that burns away imperfections."

04:59.924 --> 05:03.177
It would appear the mood at this table
has become rather awkward.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.512
[grunts]

05:04.595 --> 05:07.473
Most likely due to your Galra lineage.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.692
Yep, definitely...

05:18.943 --> 05:19.777
awkward.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.199
[Keith] Atlas, we had
some technical difficulties.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.326
We'll be delayed.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.579
-Copy that. How long?
-We're still assessing that.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.123
Might be a few hours.
We'll keep you updated.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.499
Roger that.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.923
[Pidge] Coming up on rendezvous point,
straight ahead.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.563
[Hunk] Anyone find it odd that Shiro
changed the rendezvous point to this?

05:57.190 --> 06:00.401
I'm reading high CO2
and low oxygen in the atmosphere.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.945
We'll need our suits to breathe
if we go out there.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.822
-I'm not going out there.
-[beeping]

06:04.906 --> 06:05.740
They're here.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.160
[Keith] Atlas, we have a visual.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.918
Paladins, get airborne immediately!

06:17.168 --> 06:18.252
This is a trap!

06:25.093 --> 06:27.720
It's just like when we were caught
by those pirates!

06:27.804 --> 06:29.597
We're about to be captured again!

06:29.931 --> 06:31.432
Emergency ejection!

06:33.142 --> 06:33.976
[grunts]

06:37.980 --> 06:40.566
-[Allura] Atlas, come in!
-[Keith] Atlas, we're under heavy fire!

06:40.650 --> 06:43.277
[Pidge] The Atlas isn't receiving
our communications!

06:53.830 --> 06:55.498
That beam has the Lions pinned.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.626
[Allura] We must have been set up.
But by whom?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.431
[beeping]

07:12.974 --> 07:14.183
[rapid beeping]

07:14.684 --> 07:17.270
[Pidge] Guys, we have incoming.
It's closing fast.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.440
[all shouting]

07:22.942 --> 07:24.026
We need to lose it!

07:24.527 --> 07:27.155
[Lance] Isn't there anything we can do
to throw it off our scent?

07:27.238 --> 07:30.158
[Pidge] Yeah, I've got an idea,
but I need a minute.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.784
I'll buy you some time.

07:32.368 --> 07:34.328
[grunting]

07:40.376 --> 07:41.919
[panting]

07:42.003 --> 07:43.713
-[Allura grunts]
-[beeping]

07:44.422 --> 07:45.965
[shouting]

07:47.341 --> 07:48.217
-[beeps]
-Got it!

07:48.426 --> 07:50.386
It shouldn't be able to detect us anymore.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.721
Then let's get out of here!

08:07.904 --> 08:09.405
[beeping]

08:12.575 --> 08:14.076
[electronic droning]

08:14.160 --> 08:16.037
[rapid beeping]

08:19.540 --> 08:21.000
[all shouting]

08:21.083 --> 08:23.044
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:24.086 --> 08:25.505
[grunting]

08:26.964 --> 08:29.800
-I need something to draw its attention!
-[Allura] I've got it!

08:32.929 --> 08:34.055
[grunts]

08:41.771 --> 08:42.605
[grunts]

08:45.900 --> 08:47.109
Huh, good job, Keith.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.987
I mean, I was just about to do that, too,
but that's cool.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.697
I might be able to hack into it.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.574
[beeping]

08:53.658 --> 08:54.951
This is Galra tech,

08:55.034 --> 08:57.954
but it looks like it's been infused
with Olkari elements.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.499
The subatomic micro-filament
is single modulated

09:01.582 --> 09:03.501
before it goes through its attenuator.

09:03.834 --> 09:04.669
Wow!

09:04.752 --> 09:06.963
-So it's pretty amazing, huh?
-Yeah.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.800
Oh, look at that, it's single modulated,
not double modulated. Huh.

09:10.883 --> 09:11.968
Oh, shut up, Hunk!

09:12.218 --> 09:15.012
This thing has been locking on
to our key encryption protocol

09:15.096 --> 09:17.056
that's built into our suits and bayards.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.350
-How did they get that?
-I don't know.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.185
Only a genius could do it.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.854
-Can't we just turn our suits off?
-Negative.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.898
If the drone had our encryption protocol,

09:25.982 --> 09:28.109
then so does that cruiser
and anyone on it.

09:28.359 --> 09:32.029
If we want to avoid detection,
we need to lose our suits and our bayards.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.615
Remove our armor?
In this place?

09:35.032 --> 09:36.534
Has anyone read the atmosphere?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.119
Oxygen low, CO2 high.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.496
We're not gonna last long.
A few hours, tops.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.123
We need our suits to survive.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.001
Yeah, at this point,
we'll survive longer without them.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.337
So, keep our suits on
and risk getting blasted,

09:48.421 --> 09:52.049
or take our suits off and live long enough
before dying from poisoned air.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.054
[whooshing]

10:04.520 --> 10:07.231
[tech] Sending you the drone's
last known coordinates now.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.151
[captain, distorted voice]
We're going after them.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.821
[Fentress] Why would we do that?
It'll risk the entire operation.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.323
We already have the Lions.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.158
The Paladins have no value.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.578
[captain] They do to me.
We're going in.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.246
-[Fentress] But--
-I am the captain,

10:22.330 --> 10:24.165
and my authority will not be questioned!

10:24.457 --> 10:28.085
You do as I say, or you will spend
the rest of your miserable days

10:28.169 --> 10:29.920
right here on this planet.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.424
-Is that understood?
-[Fentress] Yes, Captain.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.927
[captain] Do not let those Lions move.

10:37.094 --> 10:40.431
-No one takes them until the hunt is over.
-Yes, Captain.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.018
-And make sure the Atlas stays put.
-Copy that.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.519
[static hissing]

10:45.603 --> 10:47.772
[Shiro] Keith, any updates on your ETA?

10:47.855 --> 10:51.484
[electronic chirping]

10:51.567 --> 10:54.528
[changes to Keith's voice] We're finishing
some repairs and about to get underway.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.572
We'll update our ETA when we're en route.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.282
[blaster fires]

10:58.908 --> 11:00.826
-[beeping]
-[blaster fires]

11:07.917 --> 11:09.960
-[blaster firing]
-[beeping]

11:13.714 --> 11:18.010
I know you have little trust for me,
but your constant presence is tiresome.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.888
If you have a problem, let's end it now.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.266
Acxa, it's not that I don't trust you.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.351
Then what is it?

11:25.726 --> 11:28.813
Honestly, I just wanted
to get to know you.

11:29.230 --> 11:33.401
-By sneaking up on me at a firing range?
-I didn't sneak up on you.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.737
Only because I'm always aware
of my surroundings.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.616
Look, I'm sorry that I may have been
following you around.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.202
It just seems like you could use a friend.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.455
I know it can be hard to fit in sometimes.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.334
I've spent my entire life not fitting in.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.669
I'm used to it.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.295
Right.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.258
I was an outcast, born and bred in war.

11:57.758 --> 12:01.053
The only way I survived
was to become worse than my enemies.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.598
I don't care about
what you may have done in your past.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.809
I know there's more to you than that.

12:07.393 --> 12:11.272
But some people only see Galra,
and I understand why.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.276
Sometimes even I question
if my people have the ability to change.

12:16.235 --> 12:20.906
By choosing to join the coalition,
you're living proof that it is possible.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.786
I guess I wanna get to know the Acxa
who turned her life around.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.206
I have a feeling
everyone would like that person.

12:35.212 --> 12:36.464
[grunting]

12:46.098 --> 12:47.433
[all grunting]

12:50.102 --> 12:53.314
[Hawkins] They've abandoned their suits.
Now how are we gonna track them?

12:54.773 --> 12:57.818
[bounty hunter] We hunt them
the old-fashioned way.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.157
[Pidge] Are we sure the Lions
are this way?

13:03.491 --> 13:04.950
Every direction looks the same.

13:05.201 --> 13:09.663
-Oh, what I'd give for a GPS right now.
-We cannot allow ourselves to panic.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.208
Clearly, we've relied on our tech
far too much.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.752
We need to focus
if we're going to get out of here.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.928
Okay, I'm lost.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.598
-[Hunk] What do we do?
-[Lance] Our Lions are that way.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.099
How do you know?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.435
Do you have a scanner you've been hiding?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.437
[Lance] No.
I just looked at the volcano.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.897
It was on our left when we came in,

13:34.980 --> 13:37.358
so I put it to our right side,
and that's the way out.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.986
-You're a genius!
-Oh, snap. Well done, Lance.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.447
-Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
-Hey!

13:43.531 --> 13:44.907
-[blaster fires]
-[Pidge] Ah!

13:48.452 --> 13:50.663
-More drones?
-No. Look!

14:00.422 --> 14:03.425
-[grunts]
-[all shouting]

14:03.509 --> 14:06.762
[shouting continues]

14:10.349 --> 14:11.892
[bounty hunter] They've split up.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.561
Stay on their trail.

14:14.061 --> 14:14.895
Get them!

14:20.985 --> 14:23.654
[Hawkins] We're on the trail
of four of the Paladins right now.

14:23.737 --> 14:24.738
[captain] Which four?

14:24.822 --> 14:29.034
The Altean, the big one,
the tiny one, and the loud one.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.579
They removed their armor
to throw us off their scent,

14:31.662 --> 14:33.914
-but we'll have them soon.
-Good.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.667
The one I really want is this way.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.175
[Keith's voice] Apologies for the delay.
We experienced a glitch in navigation.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.052
I will have to get back to you.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.513
Everything okay out there, Keith?

14:49.930 --> 14:51.599
Do you need help from the Atlas?

14:52.016 --> 14:54.059
No assistance required, thank you.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.269
Lance will figure it out.

14:55.519 --> 14:58.606
Right, Lance, the navigation genius.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.607
Affirmative.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.530
-How long have they been delayed?
-They should have arrived when we did.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.782
Something doesn't seem right.

15:08.866 --> 15:09.950
[Curtis] Look at this.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.287
It looks like their frequency
has been pinging off a decoy.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.705
I'm intercepting it now.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.333
[Paladins overlapping] Atlas!
This is an emergency! Atlas, come in!

15:17.416 --> 15:19.126
We're under attack!
It was a trap!

15:19.293 --> 15:21.879
We need all hands on deck immediately!

15:25.841 --> 15:27.843
[grunting]

15:34.892 --> 15:35.809
[grunting]

15:38.103 --> 15:41.440
[bounty hunter] You think I forgot
about you, tiny Paladin?

15:41.732 --> 15:44.985
I'll make you pay for what you did to me!

15:47.446 --> 15:50.699
[Pidge and Hunk panting]

15:52.576 --> 15:54.495
[breathing heavily]

15:54.578 --> 15:55.537
We need to hurry.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.539
They're right behind us.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.043
[Pidge] The CO2 is poisoning us
by the minute,

16:01.126 --> 16:02.836
and we don't know where we're going.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.380
We can't keep running.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.839
[Hunk groans]

16:05.923 --> 16:07.675
Okay. What do we do?

16:08.425 --> 16:10.010
We have to make a stand.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.933
-[both grunt]
-[blaster charges]

16:16.016 --> 16:19.228
[bounty hunter] Your brother isn't here
to help you this time.

16:19.603 --> 16:22.439
And I've upgraded since we last met.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.361
[both shout]

16:27.903 --> 16:29.446
[bounty hunter grunts, laughs]

16:29.530 --> 16:31.198
[both shouting]

16:33.158 --> 16:34.243
[Hunk] Whoa!

16:34.326 --> 16:36.453
All right! Nice work!

16:37.121 --> 16:40.207
[gasps] Found the Lions.
This way.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.378
[Allura panting]

16:46.630 --> 16:50.426
Okay, if my volcano logic
is correct... [panting]

16:50.509 --> 16:52.636
the Lions should be
on the other side of this--

16:52.720 --> 16:55.264
-[grunts]
-[groaning]

16:56.015 --> 16:58.726
Allura, get out of here. Go!

16:58.809 --> 17:00.310
-[shouts]
-[blaster charges]

17:01.603 --> 17:02.813
[pirate] Looks like she left.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.025
Don't worry, we'll find her for you.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.277
[both grunting]

17:10.988 --> 17:11.989
-Thanks.
-[rumbling]

17:12.072 --> 17:12.948
[gasps]

17:16.326 --> 17:17.327
The Atlas!

17:18.704 --> 17:21.123
That's where the ghost protocol
is emanating from.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.292
Hit them with the electromagnetic pulse.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.549
-[shouting]
-[alarm blaring]

17:33.635 --> 17:35.429
[both laughing, coughing]

17:35.512 --> 17:36.930
[pirate ship crashes]

17:38.057 --> 17:39.641
[Fentress] Squadron Z, come in.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.936
Squadron Echo, come in.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.189
HQ, come in.

17:46.356 --> 17:50.110
[sighs] HQ is not responding
and the other pirates are offline.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.737
I never signed up for this!

17:52.404 --> 17:53.989
[captain] Well, you're in it now.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.467
Sophisticated hacking
and jamming abilities.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.718
Impressive.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.179
It's nice to find others on my level.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.890
Yeah, it's terrific.
Now where's your leader?

18:20.474 --> 18:23.560
I don't know.
I lost her signal when you attacked.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.523
But she's out there somewhere,
hunting down the Paladin you call "Keith."

18:28.690 --> 18:30.859
And who exactly is your leader?

18:36.365 --> 18:37.658
[gasps, grunts]

18:44.164 --> 18:45.874
-[grunts]
-[blaster charges]

18:48.460 --> 18:49.294
[Fentress] Huh?

18:50.379 --> 18:51.213
[Keith grunts]

18:52.256 --> 18:54.091
[panting]

19:00.973 --> 19:01.807
[helmet hisses]

19:06.645 --> 19:07.729
Zethrid?

19:08.188 --> 19:10.732
You took Ezor from me! [shouts]

19:13.277 --> 19:15.279
[both grunting]

19:23.078 --> 19:24.830
[both grunting]

19:25.581 --> 19:27.666

19:29.585 --> 19:32.087
[Zethrid shouting]

19:35.340 --> 19:37.676
-[shouting]

19:41.096 --> 19:45.267
-[groans]
-[shouting echoes]

19:48.270 --> 19:51.273
[Keith] I don't know what you think I did.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.609
[panting]

19:54.443 --> 19:55.903
You took away everything.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.531
And now my face
will be the last one you see! [growls]

20:00.449 --> 20:01.366
[shouts]

20:03.202 --> 20:04.912
[groaning]

20:05.204 --> 20:06.330

[blaster charges]

20:23.180 --> 20:24.306
[both grunt]

20:29.228 --> 20:30.562
Does anyone have the shot?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.522
-[beeping]
-[Rizavi] It's too risky!

20:36.902 --> 20:39.947
Zethrid, don't do this!

20:40.739 --> 20:42.449
I knew you'd come.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.534
Now you will feel what I felt.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.119
It's over.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.621
You're surrounded.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.207
You think this deters me, Acxa?

20:50.499 --> 20:54.002
I welcome death now that Ezor's gone.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.800
Zethrid, I know you hurt.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.551
Ezor hurt, too.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.720
That's why she left you.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.015
She couldn't keep holding on to the anger.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.226
Stop!

21:09.810 --> 21:11.311
Hear my words.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.355
Remember how we first met.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.692
We were all so full of hate and rage,

21:16.775 --> 21:19.152
half-breeds rejected by the Galra.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.780
Lotor used us.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.574
He led us down a painful path,

21:24.658 --> 21:27.828
a never-ending cycle
of destruction and loss.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.749
Now's your chance to break that cycle...
with me, with Ezor.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.460
She wants you to leave the rage behind.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.507
I'm too far gone.
She'll never take me back!

21:40.966 --> 21:42.509
Wait! Please!

21:42.592 --> 21:44.303
Don't let the rage control you.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.888
All I have left...

21:48.307 --> 21:49.683
is revenge!

21:53.312 --> 21:55.147
[blaster charges]

21:55.230 --> 21:57.941
-[blaster fires]
-[Zethrid grunts, echoing]

22:14.875 --> 22:16.668
[straining]

22:33.351 --> 22:35.312
[Zethrid] You waste your time, Acxa.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.399
I know you're angry,
but I refuse to give up on you.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.444
And I know someone else
feels the same way.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.954
[theme music playing]
