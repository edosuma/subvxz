00:32.555 --> 00:34.523
"X" equals two...

00:34.557 --> 00:37.526
GUY:
Come on, reach
up higher.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.188
"Y" equals seven.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.027
GUY:
Your butt equals ten.

00:42.065 --> 00:44.124
Why don’t you
take a picture, Stu?

00:44.167 --> 00:46.032
It would last longer.

00:46.069 --> 00:47.866
Okay. Work it.

00:47.904 --> 00:49.929
(Gus chuckling)

00:49.973 --> 00:55.070
"X" equals jerk,
"Y' equals pig...

00:55.111 --> 00:56.772
Hey, you kicked me.

00:56.813 --> 00:57.973
I'm sorry.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.641
I closed my eyes,
and I was thinking

00:59.682 --> 01:02.378
of those stupid guys
in my math class.

01:02.418 --> 01:04.352
Oh, and the guy
in the parking lot,

01:04.387 --> 01:08.551
and that volunteer
pool cleaner

01:08.591 --> 01:10.024
who always comes by
when I'm swimming.

01:10.059 --> 01:11.151
Tell me about it.

01:11.194 --> 01:14.027
I once fell for a free breast
examination in a bar.

01:14.063 --> 01:16.554
It just makes me so...
ooh, so... mmm!

01:16.599 --> 01:20.057
MAN (on TV):
There's nothing
in the rule book

01:20.103 --> 01:21.331
that was a robot

01:21.371 --> 01:23.339
can't play in the Frat Olympics.

01:23.373 --> 01:26.069
Hey, why don't the nerds
just move across town

01:26.109 --> 01:29.169
instead of living right next
door to the jock fraternity?

01:29.212 --> 01:30.179
That way, nobody

01:30.213 --> 01:32.181
will be constantly
breaking their gadgets.

01:32.215 --> 01:33.648
No, no, that's
wrong, Bobby.

01:33.683 --> 01:37.119
If the nerds stood up
to them once in a while

01:37.153 --> 01:40.554
they wouldn't get
their gadgets broken
in the first place.

01:40.590 --> 01:42.558
Listen, if you don't fight
for yourself

01:42.592 --> 01:44.560
you're never going to get
anyone's respect.

01:44.594 --> 01:47.461
Yeah, there's nothing worse
than people not respecting you.

01:47.497 --> 01:49.624
Every time I get hooted at,

01:49.666 --> 01:52.134
I have to take
an hour of Tae Bo.

01:52.168 --> 01:54.830
Tae Bo? Is that
that new Oriental way

01:54.871 --> 01:57.533
of moving your couch around?

01:57.574 --> 02:00.441
Nuh-uh. It's an exercise class
where you punch and you kick

02:00.476 --> 02:02.171
till you can’t think
of anything else no more.

02:02.212 --> 02:04.772
No, actually, you punch, kick,
kick, squat, squat,

02:04.814 --> 02:07.408
rest, two, three,
all to music, and kick.

02:07.450 --> 02:09.577
Oh, it's dancing.

02:09.619 --> 02:11.109
Huh. That sounds...

02:11.154 --> 02:12.553
No.

02:13.856 --> 02:15.289
Uh, Mr. Strickland,
a couple of folks

02:15.325 --> 02:17.225
from the Chamber
of Commerce are here

02:17.260 --> 02:19.387
to thank you
for your work with the orphans.

02:19.429 --> 02:21.363
Orphans? Chamber of Commerce?

02:21.397 --> 02:26.425
You are so modest, sir.

02:26.469 --> 02:29.632
Well, looky who's
back from rehab.

02:29.672 --> 02:32.368
It's, uh, it's my
little baby brother.

02:32.408 --> 02:37.209
I want my money, Buck.

02:37.247 --> 02:41.047
Boy, you never were much
with the ladies, but...

02:41.084 --> 02:42.551
Ow, ow, ow!

02:42.585 --> 02:45.418
Watch it there, Shrek,
that's a Eye-talian suit.

02:45.455 --> 02:46.922
Greta
ain't my girlfriend.

02:46.956 --> 02:49.083
She's a lady boxer
I manage.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.060
Although we did get dirty
one time.

02:52.095 --> 02:53.357
(animal-like grunting)

02:53.396 --> 02:55.091
All right, all right, I'll pay.

02:55.131 --> 02:57.292
Donna, put a hold
on them payroll checks.

02:57.333 --> 03:01.463
You putting the squeeze on me
really takes me back.

03:01.504 --> 03:03.096
Hey, I know a new girlie club

03:03.139 --> 03:06.040
where we could ogle
some ladies... no cover charge.

03:14.717 --> 03:17.277
Whoo-whee!
Whata workout!

03:17.320 --> 03:22.087
I'm sweating
like a lumberjack.

03:24.727 --> 03:26.627
Well, hey, there, Luanne.

03:26.663 --> 03:27.823
Good workout.

03:27.864 --> 03:29.559
Yeah, it looked good from here.

03:29.599 --> 03:30.759
If you were looking at me

03:30.800 --> 03:31.824
I'm going
to have to have

03:31.868 --> 03:34.200
both of your
gym memberships revoked.

03:34.237 --> 03:37.638
And I would hate to do that
because you both look terrible.

03:37.674 --> 03:38.800
Uh, no, no, no.

03:38.841 --> 03:40.172
W-We're,
we're just, uh, uh...

03:40.209 --> 03:41.506
Scouting talent.

03:41.544 --> 03:44.012
Yeah, I'm a
boxing promoter

03:44.047 --> 03:46.538
and, uh, we’re just
here scouting talent.

03:46.582 --> 03:49.881
I'd love to see
you in the ring.

03:49.919 --> 03:50.886
Boxing.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.320
Huh. My mama's in prison

03:53.356 --> 03:54.846
'cause she fights so much.

03:54.891 --> 03:56.859
Do you think
that there's some way

03:56.893 --> 03:58.986
her genes could have been
passed down to me?

03:59.028 --> 03:59.995
Wait a minute, Randy.

04:00.029 --> 04:01.326
Luanne here might make

04:01.364 --> 04:03.594
a really good opponent
for Greta.

04:03.633 --> 04:06.761
Yeah, we could put up posters
all over town.

04:06.803 --> 04:08.771
Call it "Beauty and the Beast."

04:08.805 --> 04:10.363
Which one am I?

04:10.406 --> 04:15.605
Because if it's okay with you,
I'd like to be the beast.

04:15.645 --> 04:16.737
(growling)

04:16.779 --> 04:18.007
Did I scare you?

04:18.047 --> 04:21.608
Okay, guess
who I ran into at the gym?

04:21.651 --> 04:22.618
Buck Strickland.

04:22.652 --> 04:24.813
He watched me do Tae Bo

04:24.854 --> 04:28.551
and he thinks
that I'd make a great boxer.

04:28.591 --> 04:30.559
Look, Luanne, I
fought at the "Y."

04:30.593 --> 04:32.686
Trust me, you
are no boxer.

04:32.729 --> 04:33.718
Y'uh-huh.

04:33.763 --> 04:36.732
Friday at midnight
in the back room at Sugarfoot's.

04:36.766 --> 04:37.755
And I am going

04:37.800 --> 04:39.495
to stand up and fight

04:39.535 --> 04:42.265
and be respected
just like you said.

04:42.305 --> 04:44.273
Luanne,
the kind of women that box

04:44.307 --> 04:47.208
don't have 50 stuffed animals
on their bed.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.268
Hey, why don't you
spend Friday night

04:49.312 --> 04:51.280
watching one of those movies
you like

04:51.314 --> 04:54.181
where the people fall in love,
and then one of them dies?

04:54.217 --> 04:57.015
Oh, Luanne, you
have to understand

04:57.053 --> 05:00.819
your uncle only wants
the best for you.

05:00.857 --> 05:04.793
That said, everything
he just told you:
Complete jackassery.

05:11.467 --> 05:15.198
Dear Lord, one of your creatures
may be hurt tonight.

05:15.571 --> 05:18.540
Please let it be
the other creature.

05:18.641 --> 05:19.835
Amen.

05:23.880 --> 05:28.283
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
okay, Luanne, looking good.

05:28.317 --> 05:29.648
Yeah, now, just remember,

05:29.685 --> 05:33.883
the key to boxing
is to jump up and down.

05:33.923 --> 05:36.221
Yeah, keep bouncing.

05:36.259 --> 05:38.591
Bounce and weave.

05:38.628 --> 05:39.993
Okay, folks

05:40.029 --> 05:41.155
you paid your moneys.

05:41.197 --> 05:47.295
Here come the honeys.

05:47.336 --> 05:55.038
The Beauty and the Beast.

06:00.616 --> 06:01.640
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

06:01.684 --> 06:03.845
Watch the kicks,
or I'll disqualify you

06:03.886 --> 06:09.222
and you'll lose
your free rib dinner.

06:09.258 --> 06:13.126
Tell Joseph and Dale if
he's listening good night

06:13.162 --> 06:14.493
and get to bed.

06:14.530 --> 06:17.431
I got a live feed with
the hostess at Sugarfoot's.

06:17.467 --> 06:19.731
She's got Luanne's fight
on the speakerphone.

06:19.769 --> 06:21.896
Oh, God, she went
through with it?

06:34.617 --> 06:37.313
Luanne, no!

06:41.023 --> 06:43.423
One, two, three, four...

06:43.459 --> 06:45.222
She's out.

06:45.261 --> 06:47.286
Whoa.

06:47.330 --> 06:48.126
I did it!

06:48.164 --> 06:49.495
I won, I won, I won!

06:49.532 --> 06:50.521
You tagged her good.

06:50.566 --> 06:51.760
What a left hook.

06:51.801 --> 06:52.768
Oh, yeah.

06:52.802 --> 06:53.996
You didn't think
I could do it

06:54.036 --> 06:55.094
but I did it.

06:55.137 --> 06:56.229
Great job, Luanne.

06:56.272 --> 06:57.500
You want to fight
some more for us?

06:57.540 --> 06:59.940
I got a contract
right here.

06:59.976 --> 07:01.068
It's very fair.

07:01.110 --> 07:02.077
(sighing)

07:02.111 --> 07:03.078
Oh, my gosh.

07:03.112 --> 07:04.875
Did you hear that,
Uncle Hank?

07:04.914 --> 07:06.882
They want me to be a
professional fighter.

07:06.916 --> 07:10.181
Ooh! I'm a
professional fighter!

07:10.219 --> 07:12.915
(squealing)

07:12.955 --> 07:14.752
(laughing)

07:14.790 --> 07:18.419
Mmm, women boxing, huh?

07:18.461 --> 07:20.258
If they wear gloves

07:20.296 --> 07:22.264
how do they scratch
each other?

07:22.298 --> 07:24.323
No, Bill, they
punch pretty hard.

07:24.367 --> 07:26.335
And Luanne was
really something.

07:26.369 --> 07:27.336
I tell you what.

07:27.370 --> 07:29.998
Dale fights more
like a girl than
she did last night.

07:30.039 --> 07:31.768
So I bit a cashier.

07:31.807 --> 07:33.331
I'm a street fighter.

07:33.376 --> 07:34.343
(sighing)

07:34.377 --> 07:35.366
Luanne, I always hoped

07:35.411 --> 07:38.141
to give my old boxing gloves
from the "Y" to Bobby

07:38.180 --> 07:39.545
but, uh, well

07:39.582 --> 07:40.981
you know.

07:41.017 --> 07:42.746
Anyway, I'd be honored

07:42.785 --> 07:45.151
if you'd wear these
in your next match.

07:45.187 --> 07:46.154
Oh

07:46.188 --> 07:47.155
Uncle Hank.

07:47.189 --> 07:51.182
Every time
I punch someone in the face

07:51.227 --> 07:52.489
I'll think of you.

07:52.528 --> 07:53.495
To Luanne!

07:53.529 --> 07:56.054
Getting rich
off a pretty lady's

07:56.098 --> 07:58.726
even better
than sleeping with one.

07:58.768 --> 08:00.497
Well, neck and neck.

08:00.536 --> 08:01.833
Well, lookee here.

08:01.871 --> 08:05.398
Now, I know
it must have killed you

08:05.441 --> 08:07.636
to throw that fight,
Big gun

08:07.677 --> 08:11.636
but it was one hell
of a convincing dive.

08:11.681 --> 08:13.114
If you had any looks

08:13.149 --> 08:15.117
you could be
a Hollywood actress.

08:15.151 --> 08:16.118
(deep voice):
Thank you.

08:16.152 --> 08:17.847
Here's your flop fee.

08:17.887 --> 08:20.879
Don't touch anything
on the way out, huh?

08:20.923 --> 08:22.185
Times have changed.

08:22.224 --> 08:24.192
Trained boxers
willing to take a dive

08:24.226 --> 08:25.750
are too
got dang expensive.

08:25.795 --> 08:29.492
Hey, Bora, you'd take a punch
for $100, wouldn't you?

08:29.532 --> 08:30.499
No, sir.

08:30.533 --> 08:31.500
Two hundred?

08:31.534 --> 08:33.501
Yes, sir, I would.

08:37.472 --> 08:38.440
Okay, Luanne

08:38.474 --> 08:42.409
Buck says this Bora
the Slammin' Slavic
is nine and four

08:42.445 --> 08:45.642
and she used to pull
a dogsled back in
her native Croatia.

08:45.681 --> 08:51.449
When my fans are out there
respecting me

08:51.487 --> 08:54.650
I feel like a strong, powerful,
ooh, independent woman.

08:54.690 --> 08:55.657
Luanne

08:55.691 --> 08:56.658
I brought you some tassels.

08:56.692 --> 08:57.659
Tassels?

08:57.693 --> 08:59.718
Yeah, it's a fight game,
boy scout.

08:59.762 --> 09:01.730
We need a little show
for the people.

09:01.764 --> 09:02.731
Oh, I get it.

09:02.765 --> 09:03.732
A little flash.

09:03.766 --> 09:05.927
Like Hector "Macho" Camacho.

09:13.409 --> 09:14.569
Light on your
feet, Luanne.

09:14.610 --> 09:16.601
She's one
of them Russian brawlers.

09:16.646 --> 09:17.635
(cheering)

09:17.680 --> 09:20.843
STRICKLAND:
Yeah, yeah, good,
Luanne, good.

09:20.883 --> 09:25.616
Now, hop like a bunny,
hop like a bunny!

09:25.655 --> 09:30.957
Oh, uh, well, you
know, like, uh,
Muhammed Ali says,

09:30.993 --> 09:35.191
"Hop like a bunny,
sting like a bee."

09:35.231 --> 09:38.689
Uh, that was "Float
like a butterfly," sir.

09:39.001 --> 09:39.990
Okay, now, Luanne...

09:40.069 --> 09:41.764
southpaw, southpaw!

09:42.805 --> 09:44.363
(groaning)

10:13.436 --> 10:14.767
Now, Luanne

10:14.804 --> 10:16.135
you beat some
tough fighters

10:16.172 --> 10:19.164
and I think you're ready
for a step up in competition.

10:19.208 --> 10:21.676
Yeah! You know,
I was reading

10:21.711 --> 10:23.679
in the Guinness Book
of World Records

10:23.713 --> 10:25.738
about a woman
who is 7'7".

10:25.781 --> 10:27.305
You think she'll fight me?

10:27.349 --> 10:29.510
Uh, maybe,
but I was thinking

10:29.552 --> 10:32.146
about the best female fighter
in Texas...

10:32.188 --> 10:35.555
George Foreman's daughter,
Freeda Foreman.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.559
Seems she's managed
by her father

10:37.593 --> 10:39.390
and four brothers
named George.

10:39.428 --> 10:41.396
Uh, uh, I already called
the Foreman camp.

10:41.430 --> 10:45.924
They told me they want nothing
to do with Luanne.

10:45.968 --> 10:47.959
Yup, they are ducking us.

10:48.003 --> 10:48.697
But don’t worry.

10:48.738 --> 10:50.933
We'll line up
another topnotch opponent.

10:50.973 --> 10:53.908
Has the pretzel lady
gotten back to us yet?

10:58.147 --> 10:59.546
I'm sorry I'm late.

10:59.582 --> 11:01.675
I couldn’t get used
to the heels.

11:01.717 --> 11:02.809
What is that?

11:02.852 --> 11:05.184
It's my outfit
for my next match.

11:05.221 --> 11:08.247
Mr. Strickland says
that if I ever want
to fight Freeda Foreman

11:08.290 --> 11:10.417
I need an image.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.188
So... ♪ ta-da! ♪

11:12.228 --> 11:14.492
I'm a fighting
French maid.

11:14.530 --> 11:15.827
(giggles)
(sighing)

11:15.865 --> 11:17.492
Dang it, I thought
I made myself clear

11:17.533 --> 11:19.865
when I told him
no boxing thong.

11:19.902 --> 11:21.301
I'm going to
go talk to Buck.

11:21.337 --> 11:22.429
You need to practice

11:22.471 --> 11:24.336
so, get out
of that stupid outfit.

11:24.373 --> 11:25.567
And for God's sake,

11:25.608 --> 11:27.872
don't leave it
where Bobby can find it.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.310
Luanne, if you want to be
punched by Freeda Foreman

11:30.346 --> 11:33.804
then Peggy Hill is the one
that can make it happen.

11:33.849 --> 11:36.044
Come on, let's
go pick a fight.

11:36.085 --> 11:39.213
It’s just that Luanne and I
are trying to build

11:39.255 --> 11:40.483
a legitimate
boxing career.

11:40.523 --> 11:41.785
BORA:
Oh, Mr. Buck.

11:41.824 --> 11:43.689
Uh, yeah, I got you, Hank.

11:43.726 --> 11:46.559
No skimpy costumes,
no dressing her like a rabbit.

11:46.595 --> 11:47.823
Thanks for coming by.

11:47.863 --> 11:50.058
Sir, Mr. Randy
is throwing up again.

11:50.099 --> 11:51.066
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.067
Thanks, uh, Penelope.

11:52.101 --> 11:53.068
Wait a minute.

11:53.102 --> 11:55.070
You're supposed to be
The Slamming Slavic.

11:55.104 --> 11:56.435
But you're just Buck's maid.

11:56.472 --> 11:57.439
Buck's maid?

11:57.473 --> 11:58.701
All right, all right,

11:58.741 --> 12:01.209
you caught me
with my pants down.

12:01.243 --> 12:02.835
I threw patsies in there

12:02.878 --> 12:04.743
to protect your
pretty little niece.

12:04.780 --> 12:07.613
Oh, God, you mean every fight
has been a fraud?

12:07.650 --> 12:09.117
What about Helga the Hammer?

12:09.151 --> 12:13.315
Librarian.
Never been in the ring.

12:23.966 --> 12:27.265
Okay, Luanne, now
you have to trash-talk
and embarrass her.

12:27.303 --> 12:29.635
It's the only way
she'll accept a
fight with you.

12:29.672 --> 12:30.639
You ready?

12:30.673 --> 12:31.640
Uh-huh.

12:31.674 --> 12:32.641
Hey, Freeda Foreman!

12:32.675 --> 12:33.972
Everybody knows
you're nothing

12:34.009 --> 12:35.840
but a fraidy cat.

12:35.878 --> 12:38.176
Wow, you have pretty eyes.

12:38.214 --> 12:40.512
Who the heck are you?

12:40.549 --> 12:41.516
Luanne Platter.

12:41.550 --> 12:43.780
It's nice to meet you.

12:43.819 --> 12:44.786
Yeah, whatever.

12:44.820 --> 12:48.449
Hey! Yeah, you, you
big can of beans!

12:48.490 --> 12:51.254
You give Luanne
here a match!

12:51.293 --> 12:53.158
Unless you're
scared, huh?

12:53.195 --> 12:54.560
Are you scared?

12:54.597 --> 12:56.895
Yeah, you're not a champ.

12:56.932 --> 12:58.297
You're a chump!

12:58.334 --> 12:59.699
Chump, chump,
chumpity-chump!

12:59.735 --> 13:01.100
Shut up, Grandma-hair.

13:01.136 --> 13:02.967
Freeda! Oh, Freeda!

13:03.005 --> 13:04.267
♪ Free-hee-hee-da! ♪

13:04.306 --> 13:06.706
All right, you want to fight?

13:06.742 --> 13:08.972
You got a fight.

13:09.011 --> 13:10.979
And when I get done
whippin' up on her

13:11.013 --> 13:12.742
I'm going
to come looking for you.

13:12.781 --> 13:16.012
What'd I do?

13:23.459 --> 13:25.689
(sighs)

13:26.095 --> 13:27.562
Uncle Hank! Uncle Hank!

13:27.596 --> 13:28.893
You'll never believe it!

13:28.931 --> 13:31.195
We got a fight
with Freeda Foreman!

13:31.233 --> 13:32.564
What? No.

13:32.601 --> 13:34.762
I know, it's amazing,
isn't it?

13:34.803 --> 13:36.498
Now, we better train.

13:36.538 --> 13:38.335
She's much
bigger than me.

13:38.374 --> 13:42.037
I think she's even
bigger than you.

13:46.849 --> 13:49.818
Well, we cannot tell her
that her fights are fixed.

13:49.852 --> 13:51.183
It would wreck her world.

13:51.220 --> 13:53.347
Well, maybe she'll
get food poisoning.

13:53.389 --> 13:55.357
You gave it to me
that one time.

13:55.391 --> 13:56.358
You could do it again.

13:56.392 --> 13:58.360
Excuse me for making
chicken tartar.

13:58.394 --> 14:03.127
I could marry
Freeda Foreman

14:03.165 --> 14:05.133
and refuse
to let her fight.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.134
May I tell you what?

14:06.168 --> 14:08.136
Talking about that dang ole
oldest champ in the world

14:08.170 --> 14:10.138
two times wearing
that ole crown, man,

14:10.172 --> 14:12.140
but talking about
that ole grease,

14:12.174 --> 14:14.142
talking about on five
pounds since I got

14:14.176 --> 14:15.143
on that lost
ole thing, man.

14:15.177 --> 14:16.144
You're right.

14:16.178 --> 14:17.145
George Foreman's a minister

14:17.179 --> 14:18.146
and a family man.

14:18.180 --> 14:19.147
He'll listen to reason.

14:19.181 --> 14:21.149
Boomhauer does it again.

14:26.388 --> 14:27.616
So if you like your food

14:27.656 --> 14:29.180
lean, mean and tasty,

14:29.224 --> 14:31.556
don’t forget to pick up one
on your way out.

14:33.762 --> 14:36.458
Mr. Foreman, sir,
I know you don't know me,

14:36.498 --> 14:38.466
but I'd like
a minute of your time.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.467
You want a grill.

14:39.501 --> 14:42.493
Uh, no, sir, I'm
pretty well set for grills.

14:42.538 --> 14:44.438
I sell them
for a living

14:44.473 --> 14:47.442
along with propane
and propane accessories.

14:47.476 --> 14:49.671
Good man. What can I do for you?

14:49.712 --> 14:51.373
Well, my niece, Luanne,

14:51.413 --> 14:53.745
challenged your daughter
to a boxing match

14:53.782 --> 14:56.148
and she's not even
in Freeda's league

14:56.185 --> 14:58.153
but I haven't been able
to bring myself

14:58.187 --> 15:00.155
to tell her that,
so I was thinking

15:00.189 --> 15:02.157
if you guys
can drop out of the fight

15:02.191 --> 15:04.159
Luanne won't get
her feelings hurt...

15:04.193 --> 15:06.161
or her face hurt,
for that matter.

15:06.195 --> 15:08.163
I respect that you want
to protect your niece.

15:08.197 --> 15:10.165
You know, I didn’t want my
daughter to become a boxer.

15:10.199 --> 15:12.929
Neither did Muhammad, but
Joe Frazier, on the other hand,

15:12.968 --> 15:15.129
he had his baby girl
boxing in the crib.

15:15.170 --> 15:17.400
So you'll cancel
the fight, Champ?

15:17.439 --> 15:18.406
You got it.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.907
Thank you. You're acting

15:19.942 --> 15:23.343
just like I'd expect
a gold medalist to.

15:23.379 --> 15:24.346
Hey,

15:24.380 --> 15:26.348
maybe there's something
you can do for me.

15:26.382 --> 15:28.282
How'd you feel about carrying
my grill in your shop?

15:28.317 --> 15:31.946
Oh, uh, sorry, we have
a strict policy about that...

15:31.987 --> 15:33.420
"No novelty grills."

15:33.455 --> 15:34.717
Novelty grill!

15:34.757 --> 15:36.725
Yeah. You know,
no offense, but...

15:36.759 --> 15:38.886
your grill is kinda
like an iron.

15:38.927 --> 15:41.418
You're calling
my grill an iron?!

15:41.463 --> 15:43.988
I've been hit below the belt
before, but nothing like this.

15:44.033 --> 15:45.432
I think it's a great product

15:45.467 --> 15:48.459
for dieters or little girls
who want to play barbecue

15:48.504 --> 15:51.496
but you can't compare it
to a propane-powered grill.

15:51.540 --> 15:52.507
Fight's on!

15:52.541 --> 15:53.508
What? No.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.009
I said fight's on.

15:55.044 --> 15:56.602
What's the matter?

15:56.645 --> 15:59.136
Smelling all that propane
caused you brain damage?

15:59.181 --> 16:00.671
That's what it
does, you know.

16:00.716 --> 16:02.775
No. That is not accurate.

16:02.818 --> 16:05.616
Those studies were all
done on sick monkeys

16:05.654 --> 16:09.488
and at least my grill
isn't sold in Housewares.

16:09.525 --> 16:12.961
Let it go, Daddy.

16:12.995 --> 16:14.121
He ain’t worth it.

16:14.163 --> 16:19.567
You're right. George Three,
get this man out of my face.

16:24.973 --> 16:26.201
I'm sorry I'm late.

16:26.241 --> 16:28.732
I ran farther
than I ever have before

16:28.777 --> 16:34.044
so look out, Freeda Foreman.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.950
Uh... Luanne, those fights
you had were fixed.

16:36.985 --> 16:41.319
The fighters were fixed?
Like my puppy?

16:41.356 --> 16:44.416
No, you see, Buck knew
that men would pay

16:44.460 --> 16:46.951
to see you dance
around the ring

16:46.995 --> 16:49.225
so he found a bunch
of cleaning ladies

16:49.264 --> 16:51.323
for you to fight and knock out.

16:51.366 --> 16:53.061
But I'm a great boxer.

16:53.102 --> 16:56.128
That's why the fans are always
yelling and hollering

16:56.171 --> 17:00.164
and... throwing... dollar bills

17:00.209 --> 17:03.576
and... oh, God, am I stupid.

17:03.612 --> 17:06.046
So, uh, you can't fight Freeda.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.241
She's a real athlete.

17:07.281 --> 17:08.544
She'll kill you.

17:08.584 --> 17:11.553
You could take a dive,
like Bora and the others.

17:11.587 --> 17:14.420
Then you'd still get paid, at
least 'cause you showed up.

17:14.455 --> 17:16.753
No. That's cheating

17:16.791 --> 17:19.282
and I got too much
self-respect for that,

17:19.328 --> 17:22.763
even if every guy in the world
thinks I'm a bimbo.

17:22.798 --> 17:25.425
Guys suck.

17:28.403 --> 17:30.166
I didn't see you
in Tae Bo today.

17:30.205 --> 17:32.173
Oh, that's probably
because I wasn't there.

17:32.207 --> 17:34.641
I don't like Tae Bo anymore.

17:34.676 --> 17:38.077
It reminds me
that I'm not really a boxer.

17:38.113 --> 17:39.171
Oh, I wish I could quit.

17:39.214 --> 17:43.116
But if I don't go,
my modeling agent yells at me.

17:43.152 --> 17:44.176
He's also my husband.

17:44.219 --> 17:47.154
Hey, I can hook
you up with him if
you're interested.

17:47.189 --> 17:49.885
But just look out because
he gets a little grabby.

17:49.925 --> 17:52.450
No, I want my next job
to be something

17:52.494 --> 17:54.189
that men will respect me for.

17:54.229 --> 17:57.130
Men are never going
to respect us.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.532
That's why we've got to use
what God... or the surgeon...

17:59.568 --> 18:03.129
gave us to get what
they got... money.

18:03.172 --> 18:05.163
So you'd do anything
for money?

18:05.207 --> 18:06.606
Or a car.

18:06.642 --> 18:08.542
So, if you were me,
would you take a dive

18:08.577 --> 18:11.341
against Freeda Foreman
for $1,500?

18:11.380 --> 18:13.678
Or a car.

18:18.687 --> 18:20.018
All right, now,
raise your hand.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.886
Which one of you fellows
is the bachelor?

18:21.924 --> 18:26.327
Hey, hey,
Luanne with you?

18:26.361 --> 18:27.919
She is not going
to show tonight.

18:27.963 --> 18:28.622
She asked herself,

18:28.664 --> 18:32.498
"What would Jesus do
if He were a lady boxer?"

18:32.534 --> 18:35.298
The answer: Not show.

18:35.337 --> 18:41.503
Now... Oh, oh, there she is.

18:41.543 --> 18:42.635
Luanne?

18:42.678 --> 18:44.646
Okay, I'm ready to
take my dive now.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.648
You promise the check
will clear, right?

18:46.682 --> 18:47.649
Yeah, eventually.

18:47.683 --> 18:48.308
Now, don't get hit.

18:48.350 --> 18:49.908
You're fighting my aunt
next week.

18:49.952 --> 18:51.351
Oh, and those gentlemen
over there

18:51.386 --> 18:53.354
are here for a
bachelor party.

18:53.388 --> 18:58.257
Now, come on, give them
a big ol' bouncy "hello."

19:11.039 --> 19:13.405
So you can see,
my grill is perfect

19:13.442 --> 19:15.171
for a big man
like yourself.

19:15.210 --> 19:19.840
I've told you six times,
I'm not interested.

19:19.881 --> 19:21.906
(bell dings)

19:21.950 --> 19:23.645
(crowd cheering)

19:23.685 --> 19:25.118
(whistles)

19:25.153 --> 19:29.055
Bounce, baby!
Whoo-hee!

19:29.091 --> 19:30.752
(whistles)

19:30.792 --> 19:32.487
(wolf whistle)

19:32.527 --> 19:33.494
One!

19:33.528 --> 19:36.497
Two!
Hey, I got
some singles!

19:36.531 --> 19:40.490
Three! Four!
Oh, I cannot watch this.

19:40.535 --> 19:43.368
MAN 1:
Say my name!

19:43.405 --> 19:45.066
Say my name!

19:45.107 --> 19:45.937
It's Bradley!

19:45.974 --> 19:47.908
Spank yourself!
(laughs)

19:47.943 --> 19:49.137
Eight!

19:49.177 --> 19:51.975
Nine!

19:52.014 --> 19:53.208
(cheering)

19:53.248 --> 19:54.840
What are you doing?

19:54.883 --> 19:55.975
Stay down!
Stay down!

19:56.018 --> 20:00.717
Oh, my God, she's
going to get killed!

20:11.600 --> 20:12.897
Oh, what the heck
is she doing?

20:12.934 --> 20:17.337
We're taking her picture
for the calendar this week.

20:19.207 --> 20:20.868
If I could take
a punch like that,

20:20.909 --> 20:23.503
I may have been able
to think of a name
besides "George"

20:23.545 --> 20:24.807
for all my sons.

20:24.846 --> 20:27.406
That gal's all skull
and no brains.

20:27.449 --> 20:31.044
She's like Joe Frazier
with lipstick.

20:31.086 --> 20:38.720
(cheering)

20:38.760 --> 20:40.057
Way to go, Luanne.

20:40.095 --> 20:43.895
Luanne, southpaw!
Southpaw!

20:47.169 --> 20:48.830
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-whoo!

20:48.870 --> 20:50.235
Luanne! Luanne!

20:50.272 --> 20:54.003
Oh, yeah!
That's the Platter in her!

20:54.543 --> 20:56.170
Man, she is tough.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.178
Stick and move.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.304
Use your left.

20:58.347 --> 21:00.008
Don't give up, Luanne!

21:00.048 --> 21:01.879
You can do it!

21:01.917 --> 21:03.942
(cheering)

21:06.455 --> 21:11.916
Stu, what did I tell you
about taking pictures of me?

21:11.960 --> 21:12.824
Whoa, whoa.

21:12.861 --> 21:14.556
No, I wanted
a picture with you.

21:14.596 --> 21:15.722
I saw your fight.

21:15.764 --> 21:17.925
You lasted three rounds
with Freeda Foreman.

21:17.966 --> 21:20.901
You are one tough chick.

21:20.936 --> 21:22.267
(sighs)

21:22.304 --> 21:23.601
Thank you.

21:23.638 --> 21:27.734
That's all I ever wanted
to hear.
