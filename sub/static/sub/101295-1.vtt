00:42.626 --> 00:43.861
Have you
seen my bracelet?

00:43.895 --> 00:45.997
No, sorry, where
did you last see it?

00:46.030 --> 00:49.801
I don't know, it's probably
just somewhere really obvious.

00:49.834 --> 00:52.036
So have you guys decided
where you're going tonight?

00:52.069 --> 00:54.172
Yeah, we're gonna
start off at the Crown

00:54.205 --> 00:56.573
and then just go
from there really.

00:58.276 --> 01:01.913
So is Rick still
coming over tonight?

01:01.946 --> 01:03.881
Yes, he's coming
over after work.

01:03.915 --> 01:07.885
Mhm, well don't worry, I'll
be out of your hair all night.

01:11.688 --> 01:12.522
Hello.

01:13.390 --> 01:14.225
Oh, hi.

01:15.126 --> 01:16.660
Yeah, still meeting there.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.629
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.698
I'll text you when
I'm in the taxi, okay?

01:22.867 --> 01:23.733
Okay, bye.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.004
Was that Evie?

01:27.038 --> 01:29.841
Mhm, Evie.

01:30.842 --> 01:32.176
I better finish getting ready.

01:32.210 --> 01:33.311
Okay.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.046
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Mhm.

01:35.079 --> 01:38.415
I'll be
heading for an early grave.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.461
Zoe, my taxi's here,
I'm off out now.

01:51.494 --> 01:52.864
Okay, have a good night.

01:52.897 --> 01:54.698
Yeah, you too, babe.

01:54.731 --> 01:55.565
Tell Rick I said hi.

01:55.599 --> 01:56.366
Yeah, will do.

02:18.823 --> 02:21.125
I got to find one.

02:21.158 --> 02:23.160
Dad took my laptop off off me.

02:23.194 --> 02:24.762
What for?

02:24.795 --> 02:27.198
Nothing really.

02:28.598 --> 02:30.600
Watching too much anime.

02:32.003 --> 02:35.806
Guess he thought it might
cure me or something.

02:37.174 --> 02:39.043
Cure you?

03:55.086 --> 03:55.920
Hello.

03:57.021 --> 03:58.356
Don't hurt me.

03:59.890 --> 04:02.994
I'll only hurt
you if you struggle.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.197
Oh fuck.

04:52.276 --> 04:54.278
Nice to see you, Rick.

04:55.346 --> 04:56.847
Hello, beautiful.

04:58.015 --> 04:59.884
What's wrong, you okay?

04:59.917 --> 05:01.218
These handcuffs really hurt.

05:01.252 --> 05:02.386
Oh shit, sorry.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.822
- Yeah.
- Yeah, get those off.

05:07.425 --> 05:09.827
Hey, listen, I didn't hurt
you or anything, did I?

05:09.860 --> 05:10.961
No, don't be silly.

05:10.995 --> 05:12.229
- Yeah?
- No.

05:12.263 --> 05:15.299
It was what
you wanted, yeah?

05:15.332 --> 05:16.267
Yeah, you know it is.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.468
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, sorry.

05:17.501 --> 05:19.370
We don't have to talk about it.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.237
Okay.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.674
What?

05:24.707 --> 05:27.912
Nothing, I just
missed you, that's all.

05:27.945 --> 05:30.647
Did you have a
good week at work?

05:30.680 --> 05:31.882
It was okay.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.051
Oh, did you you pick up...

05:34.085 --> 05:35.419
Did I pick up?

05:37.888 --> 05:40.623
Of course, my lady.

05:40.657 --> 05:42.126
It better be the good stuff.

05:42.159 --> 05:45.362
Please, have I
ever let you down?

05:45.396 --> 05:46.629
Yes.

05:46.663 --> 05:49.732
How about you get up and
I'll get us some drinks?

05:49.767 --> 05:51.068
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Yeah?

05:52.269 --> 05:55.439
Oh, actually, babe,
have you got any food?

05:55.473 --> 05:56.841
- Yes, I do have some food.
- You do.

05:56.874 --> 06:00.044
Yeah, I'm just a
little bit, you know.

07:45.748 --> 07:47.218
There's no one there, okay?

08:26.090 --> 08:28.058
Ass.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.227
See, I told you
there's nothing there.

10:57.341 --> 10:58.175
Yes?

10:59.376 --> 11:01.912
We spoke on the phone
earlier about the room.

11:03.213 --> 11:06.116
Oh, blimey, Owen I presume.

11:07.484 --> 11:08.986
Please come in.

11:09.019 --> 11:10.320
Oh, can I help you with that?

11:10.354 --> 11:12.923
No, it's fine, thank you.

11:19.831 --> 11:21.498
How was your journey?

11:21.532 --> 11:23.066
Took longer than I expected.

11:26.003 --> 11:28.739
Well, let's get
you settled in.

11:28.773 --> 11:30.140
If you head up to
the first floor,

11:30.174 --> 11:32.309
your room is the first
door on the left.

11:35.312 --> 11:38.015
I'll put the kettle
on while you unpack.

12:18.288 --> 12:20.724
Before the song,
we got some shoutouts to do.

12:20.758 --> 12:21.893
So I want to say hello to...

12:21.926 --> 12:23.427
- Morning.
- Oh, morning, love.

12:23.460 --> 12:25.596
I made some fresh
coffee, want some?

12:25.629 --> 12:27.464
No thanks, I don't have time.

12:27.498 --> 12:28.699
Amy's gonna be here soon.

12:28.732 --> 12:29.934
What time are
you working till?

12:29.968 --> 12:31.836
I'm there till close I think.

12:33.270 --> 12:36.039
Are you sure you're
ready for this?

12:36.073 --> 12:38.542
Dad, we've been over this.

12:39.743 --> 12:41.612
I just think if you
wanted to start working,

12:41.645 --> 12:43.046
you could get something
more suitable for you.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.215
Yeah, I know, but
this is just for now.

12:45.249 --> 12:47.551
Just to get me back on my feet.

12:47.584 --> 12:48.519
And
we've also got one...

12:48.552 --> 12:51.923
I just get worried.

12:51.956 --> 12:54.725
I know, there's
nothing to worry about.

12:54.759 --> 12:56.727
They listen
to me every Monday morning.

12:56.761 --> 12:57.561
Well, thank you.

12:57.594 --> 12:58.428
Oh, I better go.

12:59.797 --> 13:01.365
Don't forget your keys.

13:01.398 --> 13:02.867
Got them.

13:02.901 --> 13:03.734
Oh, Jenna.

13:05.135 --> 13:07.204
Tonight we
have an old school classic.

13:07.237 --> 13:08.138
Yes?

13:08.171 --> 13:09.506
Have a nice day at work.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.775
Thanks, Dad, I love you.

13:10.808 --> 13:12.109
I love you too, darling.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.047
And follow
us on our social media.

13:23.186 --> 13:24.521
- Hello!
- Hello.

13:29.593 --> 13:30.694
Aw, you okay?

13:31.796 --> 13:32.997
I've been better.

13:33.031 --> 13:34.531
Aw, why, what's up?

13:35.632 --> 13:37.301
I'm late studying
for my exams.

13:37.334 --> 13:39.003
I'm really falling behind.

13:39.037 --> 13:40.571
No, I'm sure
you're gonna do fine.

13:40.604 --> 13:42.172
I hope so.

13:42.205 --> 13:43.507
Don't want to be stuck
working at Mom an Dad's place

13:43.540 --> 13:44.976
for the rest of my life.

13:45.009 --> 13:47.912
I'm sure there are worse
places to be working.

13:47.946 --> 13:48.780
Come on.

13:55.319 --> 13:56.320
Knock knock.

13:56.353 --> 13:57.187
Come in.

13:58.488 --> 14:00.792
Here you go, nice cup of tea.

14:00.825 --> 14:02.125
Thank you.

14:02.159 --> 14:04.194
Well, it's my pleasure.

14:06.330 --> 14:07.264
Oh, um...

14:08.131 --> 14:10.434
Oh, no, it's all right.

14:12.135 --> 14:16.673
A lot of visitors seem to have
an interest in misfortunes

14:17.875 --> 14:20.044
this town has suffered
in the last few years.

14:21.545 --> 14:23.614
Seems a little
morbid for my taste,

14:23.647 --> 14:25.783
but each to their own I say.

14:27.885 --> 14:29.754
Just do me a favor.

14:33.390 --> 14:35.927
A lot of people around
here are very sensitive

14:35.960 --> 14:37.795
about what's
happened in the past.

14:39.396 --> 14:43.667
Try to keep your
interests to yourself.

14:44.969 --> 14:47.872
Not everyone's as understanding
as I am on the matter.

14:50.507 --> 14:53.410
Well, I'll let you settle in.

14:53.443 --> 14:56.213
Oh, drink your tea
before it gets cold.

14:56.246 --> 14:58.482
I'll just be downstairs
if you need anything.

15:03.253 --> 15:05.555
You going to
Evie's this weekend?

15:05.589 --> 15:08.458
I thought we were
working that night.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.762
That's the benefit
of working for parents.

15:10.795 --> 15:11.996
I'll have a word with my dad.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.430
See if we can get
off work early.

15:13.463 --> 15:15.599
Yeah, Ames, I don't
think I'm really ready

15:15.632 --> 15:18.201
- for a party yet.
- Aw but it'd be good for you.

15:19.103 --> 15:20.203
Plus, you never know.

15:20.237 --> 15:22.006
You might end up
hooking up with someone.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.240
I should be so lucky.

15:23.273 --> 15:24.741
Carl might be there.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.278
What, I wouldn't kick him
out of bed for farting.

15:28.311 --> 15:30.815
I don't really want a
relationship at the moment.

15:30.848 --> 15:33.084
Who said anything
about a relationship?

15:33.117 --> 15:34.685
Yeah, I haven't
really thought about

15:34.718 --> 15:37.454
any of that kind of
stuff, not since...

15:37.487 --> 15:38.790
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

15:39.957 --> 15:41.425
Oh, I never meant
to bring that up.

15:41.458 --> 15:42.827
No, it's fine.

15:42.860 --> 15:45.797
Honestly, it's fine,
I'm just being silly.

15:45.830 --> 15:49.232
And I think I'm a bit
nervous about today, so.

15:49.266 --> 15:50.567
Oh, you'll be fine,

15:50.600 --> 15:52.335
especially with me
showing you the ropes.

15:52.369 --> 15:55.006
You know I'm here
if you want to talk.

15:55.039 --> 15:56.306
I know.

15:56.339 --> 15:58.776
I just need to get
on with my life

15:58.810 --> 16:01.278
and just put all this behind me.

16:01.311 --> 16:03.647
It's what Zoe
would've wanted, so.

16:03.680 --> 16:04.882
She'd be proud of you.

16:04.916 --> 16:06.383
I know.

16:06.416 --> 16:09.252
And I really appreciate your
mom and dad doing this for me.

16:10.687 --> 16:14.058
Anyway, oh my god, let's
just not get on a downer.

16:15.093 --> 16:17.461
- Yes, I agree.
- Let's go.

16:17.494 --> 16:18.830
How's my hair look?

16:18.863 --> 16:19.663
Gorgeous.

16:19.696 --> 16:21.065
It better.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.159
Excuse me.

16:48.192 --> 16:49.392
Yes, what do you want?

16:51.162 --> 16:52.864
I was just.

16:52.897 --> 16:55.166
I was wondering if you come
into these woods often.

16:55.199 --> 16:57.534
And who wants to know?

16:57.567 --> 16:59.369
Oh, I'm an
investigator of sorts.

16:59.402 --> 17:01.304
You see, I'm looking into
the history and the murders

17:01.338 --> 17:03.040
and the disappearances that
have happened in this town.

17:03.074 --> 17:05.009
And I know that there's
been a lot of evidence

17:05.041 --> 17:06.510
found in these woods,
so I was just thinking...

17:06.542 --> 17:10.114
And what exactly
are you implying?

17:10.147 --> 17:11.714
Oh no.

17:11.748 --> 17:15.585
Oh, no, no, I just wanted to
know if you've seen anything.

17:17.088 --> 17:19.321
Now you listen here.

17:19.356 --> 17:22.425
There's been too much loss
and sorrow in this town

17:22.459 --> 17:25.930
in the past without people
like you coming here

17:25.963 --> 17:27.165
to try and dig it up.

17:29.167 --> 17:34.172
Now I advise that you go
back to where you came from.

17:35.338 --> 17:36.908
Because if you go
looking for trouble,

17:37.842 --> 17:39.977
then you just might find it.

17:41.444 --> 17:42.712
Don't go.

17:42.746 --> 17:45.448
I said leave.

17:59.663 --> 18:00.898
You're a natural.

18:00.932 --> 18:02.332
How you finding it so far?

18:02.365 --> 18:03.533
Yeah, I like it.

18:03.567 --> 18:04.601
Just wait till
the lunchtime rush.

18:04.634 --> 18:05.903
That's the real test.

18:05.937 --> 18:06.971
Oh, I'm sure can handle it.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.471
So sorry I didn't warn you.

18:18.850 --> 18:20.918
Oh, look what the
cat dragged in.

18:20.952 --> 18:21.752
Hey, bitch.

18:21.786 --> 18:23.520
Love you too, darling.

18:23.553 --> 18:24.856
Don't look him down.

18:24.889 --> 18:25.689
I'm joking.

18:25.722 --> 18:26.523
Hello, Pete.

18:26.556 --> 18:27.758
Hello.

18:27.792 --> 18:30.594
Hello, Jenna,
are you all right?

18:30.627 --> 18:32.063
- Yeah.
- Haven't seen you for ages.

18:32.096 --> 18:33.496
I know, it's been
a while, hasn't it?

18:33.530 --> 18:34.799
Yeah.

18:34.832 --> 18:35.532
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

18:35.565 --> 18:37.168
- And you?
- Yeah.

18:37.201 --> 18:38.936
Amy said you got
a job here now.

18:38.970 --> 18:40.437
Yeah.

18:40.470 --> 18:41.404
I don't know why you'd want
to work in a dump like this.

18:42.940 --> 18:44.342
Anyway, I was just passing by.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.844
And we found this amazing
venue for the party.

18:46.878 --> 18:47.711
It's gonna be so good.

18:47.744 --> 18:48.578
Where is it?

18:48.612 --> 18:50.447
Blossomfield?

18:50.480 --> 18:51.282
Blossomwood.

18:51.315 --> 18:52.515
Yeah, Blossomwood.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.018
We rented out one
of the barns there.

18:54.051 --> 18:56.187
So we can stay over and you
can do whatever you like.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.621
It's gonna be so good.

18:57.654 --> 18:58.789
Very posh.

18:58.823 --> 18:59.991
Yeah, there's
around nothing,

19:00.024 --> 19:01.792
so we can just do
what the hell we like.

19:01.826 --> 19:02.659
You should come.

19:05.029 --> 19:07.430
Yeah, I don't know yet.

19:07.464 --> 19:08.665
Everybody will be there.

19:08.698 --> 19:10.801
And I think you should
take time for yourself.

19:10.835 --> 19:12.236
Well, I'll try to.

19:12.270 --> 19:14.038
Babe, make a move.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.173
Yeah, in a minute.

19:16.207 --> 19:18.976
Anyway, girls, it
was good to see you.

19:19.010 --> 19:20.177
- Bye.
- Hope you come, Jenna.

19:20.211 --> 19:21.379
- Yeah.
- Babe.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.546
You're so impatient.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.118
- See you later.
- See you later, bye.

19:27.151 --> 19:28.718
Sorry, I didn't
know she was coming.

19:28.753 --> 19:30.321
No, it's fine.

19:30.354 --> 19:31.521
It was nice to see her.

19:32.757 --> 19:34.358
She's a pain in the ass.

19:34.392 --> 19:35.826
I do love her though.

19:35.860 --> 19:40.865
Yeah, yeah, I feel bad cutting
everyone off for so long.

19:41.799 --> 19:43.633
You shouldn't,
they understand.

19:43.667 --> 19:47.271
Yeah, anyway, I'm
gonna get back to work.

20:21.238 --> 20:24.574
You fuckin' twat, you
scared the life out of me.

20:26.911 --> 20:28.578
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

20:30.513 --> 20:32.649
Fucking stupid clown cunt.

21:15.059 --> 21:15.893
No, no.

21:52.530 --> 21:54.664
Oh my god, sorry.

21:57.101 --> 21:59.270
Sorry, I can I help you?

21:59.303 --> 22:00.871
Don't you remember me, Jenna?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.975
No, should I?

22:06.477 --> 22:08.312
Charlotte, Zoe's friend.

22:09.914 --> 22:13.117
Oh my god, I'm so sorry,
I didn't recognize you.

22:16.153 --> 22:17.620
How have you been?

22:18.956 --> 22:21.691
You know, I'll never
understand why Zoe picked you

22:21.724 --> 22:23.693
to move in with her over me.

22:23.726 --> 22:25.796
I'm betting it's her
mother's decision.

22:27.264 --> 22:28.532
Bitch never liked me.

22:29.934 --> 22:31.668
Yeah, sorry, I
need to go actually.

22:31.701 --> 22:32.602
Buh-bye.

22:40.177 --> 22:41.011
Your change.

22:42.645 --> 22:43.481
Yeah.

23:04.401 --> 23:05.635
And we're closed.

23:08.105 --> 23:10.007
Are you all right?

23:10.040 --> 23:11.475
Yeah, I think so.

23:13.844 --> 23:15.279
I don't know.

23:15.312 --> 23:18.616
One of Zoe's friends was just
outside acting really weird.

23:18.648 --> 23:19.884
Weird how?

23:19.917 --> 23:22.286
I don't know,
just really creepy.

23:24.288 --> 23:25.990
Well, what did she want?

23:27.057 --> 23:29.827
Nothing, I don't know.

23:29.860 --> 23:31.462
Are you sure you'll all right?

23:31.495 --> 23:32.863
Do you want me to get my dad?

23:32.897 --> 23:35.432
No, no, honestly I'm
just being paranoid.

23:35.466 --> 23:37.468
And she's gone now
anyway, so it's fine.

23:40.070 --> 23:42.339
Come here, you draft sod.

23:43.541 --> 23:44.875
Aw, thank you.

26:35.112 --> 26:37.748
Hey, Zoe, this guy's
got the best shit.

26:37.782 --> 26:38.615
Who?

26:40.851 --> 26:43.087
And he gave me a freebie.

26:44.555 --> 26:46.890
Come on, Charlotte, I
don't do that shit anymore.

your memory might
be working better.

Yeah, okay, you really
need to leave me alone now,

34:50.174 --> 34:52.742
Charlotte, because I've told
the police everything I know.

34:52.777 --> 34:55.146
So you just need to
leave me alone now.

34:55.179 --> 34:56.545

35:35.853 --> 35:36.686
I'm sorry.

35:38.688 --> 35:39.824
What the fuck are you doing?

35:39.857 --> 35:40.858
I'm sorry.

35:42.525 --> 35:46.063
Oh my god, you don't just
grab a fucking stranger

35:46.097 --> 35:47.331
in the streets.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.102
Who the fuck are you?

35:51.135 --> 35:52.003
My name's Owen.

35:53.637 --> 35:55.072
Why are you following me?

35:55.106 --> 35:58.376
Because I wanted to talk
to you about your friend Zoe.

35:59.509 --> 36:01.245
Is he bothering you
or what, this guy?

36:05.249 --> 36:07.218
What do you know about Zoe?

36:08.652 --> 36:12.223
I want to talk to you
about her and her friend.

36:12.256 --> 36:13.723
I think I know what happened.

36:14.825 --> 36:16.861
Please, can we talk?

36:26.170 --> 36:27.838
I'm all right
honestly, thanks.

36:56.633 --> 37:00.137
You know, you really need to
work on your people skills.

37:00.171 --> 37:02.706
Grabbing me like that
was not cool at all.

37:04.141 --> 37:06.743
I'm sorry, I'm not used
to being around people.

37:14.684 --> 37:17.188
So are you gonna tell
me what this is all about?

37:21.591 --> 37:24.762
I want to know what
happened that night.

37:33.004 --> 37:35.206
Not much to tell
really to be honest.

37:37.674 --> 37:40.710
I was out drinking with
friends and when I got home,

37:40.744 --> 37:43.546
I found Rick dead
in our hallway.

37:45.749 --> 37:46.984
No sign of Zoe anywhere.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.390
Police didn't really tell me
much of anything to be honest.

37:52.423 --> 37:55.459
And as far as I know,
it's still an open case.

38:03.633 --> 38:05.735
Can't get the sight
of him out of my mind.

38:08.506 --> 38:10.573
I know what that's
like, I'm sorry.

38:16.013 --> 38:21.018
Well, it's been almost a year
and no word from the police.

38:27.690 --> 38:30.261
You said you might
know something.

38:31.561 --> 38:35.598
Yes, I used to live
here when I was little,

38:35.632 --> 38:37.567
and I spent so much
time in the woods.

38:38.701 --> 38:41.439
I would carry a branch,
and it was my sword.

38:42.572 --> 38:44.375
I used to think
that I was so brave.

39:31.989 --> 39:34.258
You can't be serious.

39:34.291 --> 39:37.394
He knew who I was
and what I had seen,

39:37.428 --> 39:39.396
and then I saw him everywhere.

39:40.730 --> 39:45.735
It was like some twisted
game of hide and seek.

39:47.104 --> 39:50.274
And my parents, they said
there's nothing to worry about,

39:51.475 --> 39:52.910
but they were wrong.

40:01.418 --> 40:02.987
So what happened to your mom?

40:04.321 --> 40:06.590
They couldn't find her like Zoe?

40:06.624 --> 40:10.060
Oh, they found her, and
she wasn't my mom anymore.

40:11.362 --> 40:12.296
She was different.

40:14.031 --> 40:14.832
Who is he?

40:14.865 --> 40:16.333
I don't know!

40:16.367 --> 40:20.037
He's a ghost or an urban legend.

40:20.070 --> 40:22.773
Something they tell to
people around a campfire.

40:23.774 --> 40:26.443
People never believe me.

40:26.477 --> 40:28.479
They don't believe
that he exists!

40:33.017 --> 40:35.653
Do you know why that is, Owen?

40:37.288 --> 40:39.490
Because this is
bloody ridiculous.

40:40.958 --> 40:42.092
I mean, you can see
that, can't you,

40:42.126 --> 40:43.827
that this is ridiculous?

40:43.861 --> 40:45.062
Your friend Zoe is alive!

40:45.095 --> 40:45.896
No, she isn't.

40:48.332 --> 40:49.500
I think you're full of shit.

40:50.634 --> 40:51.835
I think you're crazy.

40:51.869 --> 40:52.670
I think you're
wasting your time.

40:52.702 --> 40:53.370
Stop, don't go.

40:53.404 --> 40:54.104
Get off me.

40:55.372 --> 40:56.340
Zoe is dead.

40:57.541 --> 40:58.809
And the police are gonna
find whoever killed her.

40:58.842 --> 41:00.044
So you just need to let it go.

41:00.077 --> 41:02.246
If I see you again,
I'm calling the police.

41:06.951 --> 41:08.786
So you know the rules?

41:10.020 --> 41:11.822
Yeah, yeah whatever
you say, babe.

41:14.258 --> 41:15.059
Are you sure about this?

41:15.092 --> 41:15.960
It's gonna be fun.

41:17.094 --> 41:17.928
Okay.

41:19.163 --> 41:19.997
Here.

41:24.734 --> 41:25.569
Okay.

41:33.244 --> 41:34.345
Kinda like this, yeah?

41:37.314 --> 41:38.782
I'm not hurting you or anything.

41:38.816 --> 41:39.749
- No.
- You sure?

41:39.783 --> 41:40.584
Yes.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.889
Because you know you can say
at any point if it pulls you.

41:45.923 --> 41:47.324
If you want like a...

41:47.358 --> 41:48.993
- Just tie it, just tie it.
- Like a safe word.

41:49.026 --> 41:50.828
Yeah, sure, okay I'm good.

41:50.861 --> 41:52.263
Okay, let's do this.

41:52.296 --> 41:53.897
Let's rock and
roll, let's do it.

42:01.672 --> 42:02.573
Really, how?

42:02.606 --> 42:03.540
You serious?

42:03.574 --> 42:05.643
- No.
- Oh, you're so shit.

42:07.811 --> 42:09.780
I need to teach you
to tie them better.

42:11.448 --> 42:14.418
Sorry, I'm not very
good at it obviously.

42:14.451 --> 42:17.454
It's okay, practice
makes perfect.

44:04.328 --> 44:05.262
Get off me!

45:51.201 --> 45:52.202
What now, Charlotte?

45:52.236 --> 45:53.704
What do you want now?

45:53.737 --> 45:56.507
So hostile, Jenna,
something bothering you?

45:56.540 --> 45:59.811
Yeah, why are
you following me?

45:59.844 --> 46:02.479
I mean, it's getting
seriously creepy.

46:02.513 --> 46:04.147
I just wanted
to ask about Zoe.

46:04.181 --> 46:05.783
You know, our mutual friend.

46:05.817 --> 46:08.118
The one you were the
last person to see alive.

46:12.523 --> 46:14.358
What the fuck
are you implying?

46:14.391 --> 46:17.361
What, that I'm some psycho
murderer, is that it?

46:17.394 --> 46:19.764
I don't know, Jenna,
you said it, not me.

46:19.797 --> 46:21.833
And you don't seem
too bothered about it.

46:24.002 --> 46:25.904
How fucking dare you.

46:28.038 --> 46:31.608
You don't know anything
about me, Charlotte.

46:32.877 --> 46:35.445
You have no fucking
idea what it's like

46:35.479 --> 46:37.748
to find a corpse in your home.

46:39.149 --> 46:41.753
I mean, you don't know what
it's like, do you, to not feel

46:41.786 --> 46:46.356
safe anywhere and to constantly,
constantly feel guilty

46:46.390 --> 46:48.860
because you feel like somehow
you could've prevented it.

46:48.893 --> 46:50.828
So fuck you,
Charlotte, fuck you.

47:15.085 --> 47:17.254
Hey, what's all this?

47:22.259 --> 47:23.093
Sorry.

47:24.896 --> 47:25.729
What's wrong?

47:26.697 --> 47:27.598
Nothing.

47:27.631 --> 47:29.767
Can I please have some water?

47:30.902 --> 47:31.735
Of course.

47:41.244 --> 47:43.915
Do you need to take
the day off work?

47:43.948 --> 47:46.717
No, honestly
I'm fine, promise.

47:48.052 --> 47:49.553
What's happened?

47:51.055 --> 47:56.094
So Charlotte just practically
accused me of murdering Zoe.

47:59.162 --> 48:01.331
And then there's this
nutjob who's basically

48:01.365 --> 48:05.335
trying to tell me that some
urban legend has kidnapped her.

48:08.205 --> 48:09.473
And it's all just
got a bit much.

48:09.506 --> 48:10.942
Fuckers.

48:10.975 --> 48:15.880
Oh my god, I just feel
like I'm going fucking mad.

48:16.747 --> 48:18.448
You're not going crazy.

48:18.482 --> 48:20.250
Just had a lot to
deal with recently.

48:20.283 --> 48:23.687
Coming back to work is
stressful enough for anyone.

48:24.989 --> 48:27.157
Do you know what?

48:27.190 --> 48:28.960
I think I will go to that party.

48:28.993 --> 48:29.894
Are you sure?

48:31.328 --> 48:35.833
Yeah, fuck it, I just need
to forget all of this nonsense

48:36.566 --> 48:38.069
and just have some fun.

48:38.970 --> 48:39.971
Atta girl.

48:43.340 --> 48:45.342
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

48:48.780 --> 48:49.847
What do you do?

48:49.881 --> 48:51.015
- Wait.
- There you go.

48:51.049 --> 48:52.817
Is it A or B to kick?

48:52.850 --> 48:53.985
Rick, Rick.

48:54.018 --> 48:55.787
- You're losing.
- Wait, is it A or B?

48:55.820 --> 48:57.387
Rick, what do you do?

48:57.421 --> 48:58.689
- Wait, don't.
- There you go.

48:58.722 --> 48:59.556
- Don't kick me like that.
- That's it.

48:59.589 --> 49:00.624
- I'm not even...
- Yes.

49:00.657 --> 49:01.591
- No.
- Yes.

49:01.625 --> 49:02.927
- Wait, wait.
- Yes, come on!

49:02.960 --> 49:04.695
In your face, motherfucker.

49:04.728 --> 49:06.730
You're supposed to let
me win at these things.

49:06.764 --> 49:07.999
Well, I can't help it.

49:08.032 --> 49:09.633
Just whooped your ass
three times in a row.

49:09.666 --> 49:12.103
I can win at loads
of stuff actually.

49:12.136 --> 49:13.137
- Yeah, I'm sure you can.
- Yeah, yeah, I can.

49:13.171 --> 49:14.072
- Yeah.
- I'm just gonna have

49:14.105 --> 49:15.739
my victory beer over here.

49:15.773 --> 49:17.008
Oh, the victory
beers I bought.

49:17.041 --> 49:19.576
- It looks good.
- Yeah, whatever.

49:21.244 --> 49:23.213
Don't
give me those eyes.

49:23.246 --> 49:24.949
I'll come over there,
I swear to god.

49:24.982 --> 49:26.383
Don't, no, don't.

49:28.552 --> 49:30.487
Don't make me come over there.

49:32.422 --> 49:35.193
Okay, you forced my hand.

49:40.697 --> 49:41.866
Tie me down.

49:45.036 --> 49:50.041
Let's go.

49:51.042 --> 49:52.309
- You like that?
- Mhm.

49:52.342 --> 49:54.912
Like to be strapped, yeah?

49:54.946 --> 49:56.613
I guess I could tie you
to the bed right now

49:56.646 --> 49:57.949
and have my way with you.

49:57.982 --> 49:59.016
- No talking.
- Yeah?

50:00.717 --> 50:02.220
Oh fuck.

50:02.252 --> 50:03.353
Who's that?

50:03.386 --> 50:04.621
It's my dad.

50:04.654 --> 50:05.823
Oh great.

50:05.857 --> 50:07.191
Do you want to me to leave?

50:07.225 --> 50:08.425
Oh no, no, it's
fine, it's fine.

50:08.458 --> 50:09.359
He's just drunk and
crashing on the couch

50:09.392 --> 50:10.795
like he always does.

50:10.828 --> 50:12.262
- Come on, stay, please.
- It's bloody weird though.

50:13.497 --> 50:14.966
I'm gonna go.

50:14.999 --> 50:18.169
I'll have my own apartment
soon, and you can come over.

50:18.202 --> 50:20.104
And we can make as
much noise as we want.

50:20.138 --> 50:20.972
Don't go.

50:24.441 --> 50:28.045
Fine, I'll stay a little
while, then I have to go, okay?

50:29.279 --> 50:30.380
- Yeah.
- Okay?

50:30.413 --> 50:32.216
- Okay.
- Cool.

50:32.250 --> 50:33.050
Ow.

50:42.226 --> 50:43.027
Help me.

50:45.062 --> 50:45.863
Rick?

50:59.977 --> 51:01.112
Tomorrow marks the
one-year anniversary

51:01.145 --> 51:02.980
since Zoe Bates and Rick Barker

51:03.014 --> 51:05.917
were involved in vicious
attacks at these apartments.

51:05.950 --> 51:09.187
What started out as a night
of passion ended in bloodbath

51:09.220 --> 51:10.221
for the long lovers.

51:12.023 --> 51:14.859
Mr. Barker's mutilated body
was found in the early hours by

51:14.892 --> 51:18.062
roommate Jenna Carter as she
returned home from a night out.

51:18.095 --> 51:19.764
However, the body of his....

51:57.500 --> 51:58.336
Hello.

52:02.405 --> 52:03.241
Hello?

52:05.776 --> 52:06.610
Speaking.

52:11.082 --> 52:13.383
No, I'm not bloody interested.

52:13.416 --> 52:14.886
Don't ring this number again.

52:26.563 --> 52:28.866
Jenna, is that you, love?

53:38.135 --> 53:39.636
Get off, get off!

54:20.244 --> 54:21.078
Hi, Dad.

54:23.747 --> 54:24.581
Dad?

54:40.197 --> 54:41.032
Dad?

54:44.734 --> 54:46.669
Dad, I'm just going
out with Amy, okay?

54:48.571 --> 54:52.376
We're going to a party
up at Blossomwood Farm.

54:52.410 --> 54:57.415
So just call me if
you need me, okay?

55:02.053 --> 55:03.154
Okay, sleep well.

55:22.840 --> 55:24.341
I'm gong now, Dad.

56:22.566 --> 56:23.733
What are you laughing at?

56:26.070 --> 56:26.904
Stop it.

56:27.972 --> 56:30.074
What are you laughing at?

56:40.184 --> 56:41.285
Where is she?

56:42.786 --> 56:45.122
What have you done with her?

56:46.023 --> 56:46.857
Jenna!

56:57.334 --> 56:58.769
Where is she?

57:11.815 --> 57:12.650
No!

57:27.131 --> 57:28.065
I hate you!

59:02.993 --> 59:03.994
Hey.

59:04.028 --> 59:05.929
Hey, how's it going?

59:05.963 --> 59:07.031
Good, you all right?

59:07.064 --> 59:08.299
- Good.
- Sweet.

59:12.102 --> 59:13.971
You all right?

59:14.004 --> 59:19.009
Jenna, Amy, get your
ass in here?

59:23.213 --> 59:24.548
Hey.

59:24.581 --> 59:26.083
Would you
like got some drinks?

59:26.116 --> 59:28.152
- Yes.
- Some shots.

59:28.185 --> 59:29.186
Are you having fun?

59:29.219 --> 59:30.020
Huh?

59:30.054 --> 59:31.488
Are you having fun?

59:31.522 --> 59:32.489
Yes, always.

59:33.557 --> 59:34.725
Where's Pete?

59:34.759 --> 59:38.128
Oh, he's at work, he's
gonna come down later.

59:39.296 --> 59:42.099
Hey, Charlotte, have
you met Amy and Jenna?

59:42.132 --> 59:43.133
We've met.

59:44.001 --> 59:44.835
Hi.

59:47.772 --> 59:49.606
Where's the bathroom?

59:49.640 --> 59:51.108
Upstairs, you can't miss it.

59:51.141 --> 59:52.142
All right.

59:54.345 --> 59:56.547
She's really mad.

59:56.580 --> 59:57.981
If you only knew.

01:00:00.084 --> 01:00:03.087
Rachel, stop
humpin' the damn dog.

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.627
Are you still glad you came?

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.964
Come on.

01:00:19.804 --> 01:00:22.239
Come on, let's go and mingle.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.629
Zoe.

01:00:45.662 --> 01:00:46.798
Who's there?

01:00:48.232 --> 01:00:49.433
Rick?

01:00:49.466 --> 01:00:52.102
Come on, who else
is it gonna be?

01:00:53.303 --> 01:00:55.239
No, no, you're dead.

01:00:55.272 --> 01:00:57.107
Oh, you kept me alive, Zoe.

01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:00.644
Come on, come here, yeah?

01:01:01.545 --> 01:01:02.913
It's okay, it's okay.

01:01:02.946 --> 01:01:05.115
Shh, I got you, I got you.

01:01:06.283 --> 01:01:07.718
Look, I'll always
be here for you.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.488
Am I going crazy?

01:01:12.824 --> 01:01:14.658
Well, you always
were pretty crazy,

01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:17.594
but hey that's why I loved you.

01:01:17.628 --> 01:01:18.763
You're still an idiot I see.

01:01:18.797 --> 01:01:20.330
Yeah, some things
never change.

01:01:22.767 --> 01:01:24.501
But you can still
get out of this.

01:01:24.535 --> 01:01:26.003
You can still win this thing.

01:01:27.137 --> 01:01:30.240
- It's hopeless.
- Don't give up, okay?

01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:32.811
The Zoe I knew never gave up.

01:02:00.337 --> 01:02:01.405
Hey.

01:02:01.438 --> 01:02:03.207
Oh not now, Charlotte, please.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:08.245
Wait, Jenna, I want
to apologize for before.

01:02:08.847 --> 01:02:09.513
I was a bitch.

01:02:12.516 --> 01:02:13.952
Forget about it, it's fine.

01:02:15.519 --> 01:02:18.222
We all had a tough time
over the last year.

01:02:19.656 --> 01:02:23.026
Doesn't excuse what I did,
and nobody more than you.

01:02:24.228 --> 01:02:26.530
I guess I was just jealous.

01:02:26.563 --> 01:02:29.299
I was never as
close to Zoe as you.

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:30.167
Zoe loved you.

01:02:31.769 --> 01:02:33.036
I just miss her.

01:02:35.138 --> 01:02:37.040
Wish they'd catch
the fuck who did it.

01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:40.511
It's worse not having
anyone to blame.

01:02:40.544 --> 01:02:41.378
I know.

01:02:42.546 --> 01:02:45.783
And I guess I tried to
put that blame on you.

01:02:45.817 --> 01:02:48.719
♪ With no sense of shame ♪

01:02:48.753 --> 01:02:51.054
♪ It's been there
all your life ♪

01:02:51.088 --> 01:02:52.055
It's okay.

01:02:54.926 --> 01:02:56.493
So you seen Evie?

01:02:58.095 --> 01:02:59.931
No, not recently.

01:02:59.964 --> 01:03:00.798
Jenna.

01:03:02.533 --> 01:03:03.367
Thank you.

01:03:04.802 --> 01:03:06.938
That was a dumb
fuckin' question.

01:03:06.971 --> 01:03:08.405
We're fine.

01:03:08.438 --> 01:03:11.074
Evie's probably getting
eaten out by someone.

01:03:13.277 --> 01:03:16.313
For a twat, the bitch
knows how to throw a party.

01:03:19.316 --> 01:03:21.552
It's a bit unfortunate
for her boyfriend, Pete,

01:03:21.585 --> 01:03:24.388
that she's doing things
she shouldn't be.

01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:26.056
Let Evie do her thing.

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:28.592
Hey, you guys want some pot?

01:03:29.693 --> 01:03:31.295
No, thank you.

01:03:31.328 --> 01:03:32.663
Suit yourself.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.529
What the fuck are you doing?

01:04:39.563 --> 01:04:41.565
Fuck.

01:04:41.598 --> 01:04:42.432
Oh my god.

01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:45.636
You're un-fucking-believable.

01:04:46.503 --> 01:04:47.404
This is a mistake.

01:04:47.437 --> 01:04:48.405
This was not meant to happen.

01:04:48.438 --> 01:04:50.240
I'm so sorry, Pete.

01:04:50.273 --> 01:04:51.174
Man, chill out.

01:04:51.208 --> 01:04:53.310
Who the fuck asked you?

01:04:53.343 --> 01:04:56.146
Honestly, this was
never meant to happen.

01:04:56.179 --> 01:04:58.248
I'll tell you
what's happening here.

01:04:58.281 --> 01:05:01.551
You're a fucking skanky whore
who can't control herself,

01:05:01.585 --> 01:05:03.687
and I can't wait
to tell everybody

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.288
what a cock-hungry
bitch you are.

01:05:05.322 --> 01:05:06.791
Hey, leave her alone.

01:05:06.824 --> 01:05:08.793
Lewis.

01:05:08.826 --> 01:05:10.327
Lewis, get your hands off him.

01:05:11.428 --> 01:05:12.897
- Lewis!
- Maybe if you weren't such

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.565
a pussy, she wouldn't have to
come looking for a real man.

01:05:19.536 --> 01:05:20.337
You know what?

01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:21.906
Fuck the pair of yous.

01:05:21.939 --> 01:05:24.374
Enjoy your party,
you fuckin' skank.

01:05:45.096 --> 01:05:47.264
Oh please, do something.

01:05:53.871 --> 01:05:56.306
Please don't hurt me, please.

01:06:14.926 --> 01:06:16.761
Don't hurt me, please.

01:06:18.863 --> 01:06:19.696
Please!

01:06:22.066 --> 01:06:22.900
Oh please.

01:06:57.869 --> 01:06:58.702
Come on.

01:07:32.804 --> 01:07:35.372
Hey,

01:07:35.405 --> 01:07:36.673

01:07:38.209 --> 01:07:40.211
Now kid where are you?

01:07:53.124 --> 01:07:56.693
Oh, dude, what the fuck?

01:07:56.726 --> 01:07:58.029

Oh Jesus.

01:10:54.537 --> 01:10:55.339
Come on.

01:13:29.326 --> 01:13:30.161
No.

01:13:33.564 --> 01:13:34.398
No.

01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:38.636
No, no.

01:13:41.038 --> 01:13:42.473
No.

01:13:55.753 --> 01:13:56.887
Look!

01:14:06.696 --> 01:14:08.465
It's okay, he's dead.

01:14:18.943 --> 01:14:21.679
Come on, let's
get you some help.

01:14:22.513 --> 01:14:24.515
It's all right, it's over.

01:17:16.487 --> 01:17:18.088
Wake up, come on.

01:17:25.764 --> 01:17:27.664
Shh, shh, shh, it's me.

01:17:31.168 --> 01:17:32.336
It's me, okay?

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.675
Where are we we?

01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:39.878
Let's get
you out of here.

01:17:39.943 --> 01:17:42.012
- Where are we?
- Come on.

01:17:49.253 --> 01:17:50.954
Where is he?

01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:53.223
Let's just get out
of here, come on.

01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:23.454
Owen.

01:18:25.255 --> 01:18:26.089
Owen.

01:18:29.059 --> 01:18:31.528
What you told me before
is true, I read it.

01:18:31.562 --> 01:18:33.130
I saw it online.

01:18:33.163 --> 01:18:37.034
Yeah, that's why we
have to get out of here.

01:18:37.067 --> 01:18:38.235
And so if it's true,

01:18:38.268 --> 01:18:40.404
then Zoe might still
be alive, mightn't she?

01:18:40.437 --> 01:18:41.638
We don't know that.

01:18:41.672 --> 01:18:43.140
No, but she could
he, couldn't she?

01:18:45.075 --> 01:18:46.743
Could she still be alive, Owen?

01:18:50.614 --> 01:18:51.448
I don't know.

01:18:52.616 --> 01:18:55.887
I don't know where any
of these tunnels go.

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.056
He could be standing
around every corner.

01:18:59.089 --> 01:19:00.591
We have to get out of here.

01:19:00.624 --> 01:19:03.962
No, no, 'cause you see if
there's the smallest chance

01:19:03.994 --> 01:19:05.830
that Zoe might still
be alive down here,

01:19:05.864 --> 01:19:07.564
then I can't go without her.

01:19:12.436 --> 01:19:13.337
I need to leave.

01:19:20.377 --> 01:19:23.447
I thought this
was what you wanted.

01:19:25.249 --> 01:19:29.419
To face off against
him, to get revenge.

01:19:29.453 --> 01:19:31.588
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:19:35.626 --> 01:19:37.127
Oh, you're scared?

01:19:38.395 --> 01:19:41.565
You're scared, it's
okay to be scared.

01:19:42.767 --> 01:19:44.568
But this isn't for me.

01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:47.404
This is what you've been
building up to, this is it.

01:19:47.437 --> 01:19:48.806
You're damn right I'm scared!

01:19:51.809 --> 01:19:54.311
This time I didn't do nothing.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:00.018
I'm an idiot, I don't
know what I'm doing.

01:20:02.452 --> 01:20:04.688
We have to get out of here.

01:20:08.927 --> 01:20:10.260
I'm not going.

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:14.498
I'm not going.

01:20:23.307 --> 01:20:24.141
Run.

01:20:35.753 --> 01:20:36.553
Help!

01:20:37.721 --> 01:20:42.693
Help!

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.896
Come on then, what
are you waiting for?

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:21.431
Come and get me, motherfucker.

01:22:53.356 --> 01:22:54.158
Zoe.

01:22:56.861 --> 01:22:57.694
Zoe.

01:24:02.592 --> 01:24:03.693
Where is she?

01:24:26.483 --> 01:24:27.317
Zoe, Zoe.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.588
I'm so sorry.

01:24:34.524 --> 01:24:35.625
I'm so sorry.

01:24:37.094 --> 01:24:40.231
Shh.

01:24:40.264 --> 01:24:41.999
Oh Zoe, I'm so sorry.

01:24:44.202 --> 01:24:46.270
I didn't know it was you.

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:49.774
Shh.

01:26:01.846 --> 01:26:02.679
You win.

01:26:04.714 --> 01:26:05.883
I'm all yours.

01:26:15.893 --> 01:26:19.363
I fucking hate you,
you motherfucker!

01:26:19.397 --> 01:26:22.066
Just like a fairy tale!

01:27:47.418 --> 01:27:49.487

01:27:59.997 --> 01:28:03.334
