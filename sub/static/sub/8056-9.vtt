WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:01.916
April!

00:02.050 --> 00:03.316
Listen, I was trying to buy

00:03.384 --> 00:05.018
this hand-crafted
mahogany wood model

00:05.586 --> 00:08.420
of a B-25 Mitchell
Panchito aircraft.

00:08.488 --> 00:10.622
- Aw, for me?
- Don't sass me.

00:10.690 --> 00:13.058
And I went to this website,
and this ad popped up

00:13.126 --> 00:15.060
that said "Hey, Ron Swanson!

00:15.128 --> 00:17.096
Check out this great offer."

00:18.163 --> 00:19.030
What's your question?

00:19.099 --> 00:21.066
My question is,
what the hell?

00:21.134 --> 00:22.801
Like, how did they know
who you are?

00:22.868 --> 00:25.236
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:25.304 --> 00:27.605
Um, there are these things
called cookies,

00:27.672 --> 00:30.040
where, like you go to a site
and buy something,

00:30.109 --> 00:32.276
it'll remember you
and then create ads

00:32.344 --> 00:33.644
for other stuff
you might want to buy.

00:33.712 --> 00:36.880
So it learns information?
About me?

00:36.948 --> 00:39.049
That seems like an invasion
of privacy.

00:39.118 --> 00:40.550
Dude, if you think
that's bad,

00:40.618 --> 00:43.553
go to Google Earth
and type in your address.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.000 --> 01:17.906
The point is, Ben and I have been
dating on and off for about a year.

01:18.219 --> 01:20.688
I am, of course, shocked...

01:20.756 --> 01:24.224
And not just because Ben
usually prefers tall brunettes.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.326
We're very sorry

01:25.393 --> 01:28.429
for the position
this puts you in.

01:28.496 --> 01:29.696
What's happening?

01:29.764 --> 01:31.030
Are you hugging me,
or are we fighting?

01:31.098 --> 01:32.231
Are you hugging or fighting?
Let me know.

01:32.299 --> 01:34.067
Neither of those things.

01:34.134 --> 01:35.869
I love both of you.

01:35.937 --> 01:38.304
You are exemplary
government employees.

01:38.372 --> 01:41.007
"Exemplary"? That's the word
we were thinking of.

01:41.075 --> 01:43.076
- Well, it's true.
- Isn't it?

01:43.143 --> 01:44.910
Which makes what
I'm about to say even sadder.

01:44.978 --> 01:46.545
Then don't say it.

01:46.613 --> 01:47.913
I'm launching
a full investigation

01:47.981 --> 01:49.648
into the extent
of your wrongdoing.

01:49.716 --> 01:52.084
Please report Monday first thing
to the council chambers

01:52.151 --> 01:55.688
for your ethics trial
and subsequent punishment.

01:58.925 --> 02:00.992
I told you
we'd feel better.

02:03.395 --> 02:04.629
Hey.

02:04.697 --> 02:06.263
It's 6:30 in the morning.

02:06.331 --> 02:08.900
Your hearing doesn't start
for another two hours.

02:08.967 --> 02:10.368
Well, I wanted
to get here early,

02:10.435 --> 02:11.769
you know,
get a feel of the room.

02:11.837 --> 02:14.038
- So you got here--
- 3:00 A.M.

02:14.106 --> 02:15.507
I couldn't sleep anyway.

02:15.574 --> 02:17.975
Well, I wanted to sneak in
before you got here--

02:18.042 --> 02:20.944
an absurd pipe dream
I now realize was impossible.

02:21.012 --> 02:22.579
Is that a present for me?

02:22.647 --> 02:24.314
Yeah.
What do you think?

02:25.383 --> 02:26.617
Li'l Sebastian.

02:26.684 --> 02:28.318
Yeah, I had him made for you
at the toy store.

02:28.386 --> 02:30.988
Aw, thank you so much
for making my life so wonderful.

02:31.055 --> 02:32.855
- You're welcome.
- I was talking to him.

02:32.923 --> 02:34.490
- Of course.
- But also to you.

02:34.558 --> 02:35.858
Thanks.

02:35.926 --> 02:37.326
I wish we could go
through this together.

02:37.394 --> 02:38.661
Look, it's going to be okay.

02:38.729 --> 02:40.496
You're just gonna get
a slap on the wrist,

02:40.564 --> 02:42.231
maybe a brief suspension.

02:42.298 --> 02:43.399
That's not okay.

02:43.466 --> 02:44.867
That's gonna go
on my permanent record.

02:44.935 --> 02:46.836
I'm not the kind of person
that has a permanent record.

02:46.904 --> 02:49.838
For me, a slap on the wrist
is like a kick to the nuts.

02:49.906 --> 02:51.740
I know it is.

02:51.807 --> 02:53.307
What's gonna happen to you?

02:53.375 --> 02:55.911
Don't worry about me.

02:55.978 --> 02:57.646
Well, look, I'll be outside
all day,

02:57.713 --> 02:59.681
right on the other side
of that wall.

02:59.749 --> 03:02.951
So, if you miss me,
you just look at this...

03:03.019 --> 03:04.852
Wrinkled, hideous monster

03:04.920 --> 03:07.154
and you'll know
I'm sitting there

03:07.221 --> 03:09.757
- rooting for you, okay?
- Okay.

03:09.824 --> 03:11.124
All right.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.560
- Go.
- Okay.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.962
Marcus Everett Langley
was Pawnee's greatest lawyer

03:15.030 --> 03:16.630
at the turn of the century.

03:16.698 --> 03:18.966
His nickname
was "Old Stone Face"

03:19.034 --> 03:20.300
because of his steely demeanor

03:20.368 --> 03:22.635
and because he got in
an accident at the rock quarry

03:22.703 --> 03:25.271
and dynamite blew up his face.

03:26.038 --> 03:27.506
Leslie Knope!
Good morning!

03:27.574 --> 03:29.976
It is snowing outside.
Isn't that great?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.377
You seem like
you're in a good mood.

03:31.444 --> 03:33.146
Actually,
I'm quite miserable.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.148
I admire and respect you,

03:35.215 --> 03:37.215
and dragging you
through an ethics trial

03:37.283 --> 03:38.750
is filling me with sadness.

03:38.818 --> 03:42.120
I have <i>never</i> felt so low.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.289
Well, you're radiating
pure joy.

03:44.356 --> 03:46.524
I went to my herbalist
and got two B-12 shots.

03:46.592 --> 03:49.661
And then I ate an unreasonable
amount of St. John's wort,

03:49.728 --> 03:51.897
and my herbalist took
this weird bee pollen paste

03:51.964 --> 03:53.230
rubbed it around my gums.

03:53.298 --> 03:55.465
And now my mouth feels
like a spaceship.

03:55.533 --> 03:57.434
This is stressful.

03:57.633 --> 03:59.234
And stress
leads to depression.

03:59.333 --> 04:02.134
And if I don't mantain an extremely
high dosages of herbal remedies,

04:02.433 --> 04:04.934
I will get <i>very</i> depressed.

04:05.177 --> 04:06.643
Oh, God.

04:06.711 --> 04:08.345
It's happening right now.

04:08.413 --> 04:11.415
We are here today to determine
whether Leslie Knope

04:11.482 --> 04:13.149
violated any municipal rules
or laws

04:13.217 --> 04:14.918
due to her romantic
relationship

04:14.985 --> 04:16.486
with her superior Ben Wyatt,

04:16.553 --> 04:18.322
whose hearing
will be held tomorrow.

04:18.389 --> 04:20.624
Would you like to make
a statement at this time?

04:21.192 --> 04:22.292
Yes.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.160
I freely admit
to the relationship,

04:24.228 --> 04:25.861
and I will not be fighting
the charges

04:25.929 --> 04:28.664
that we violated Chris' rule.

04:28.732 --> 04:32.134
But we did nothing else wrong
or unethical.

04:32.202 --> 04:35.604
In 1849, Sarah Nelson Quindle
exposed her elbow outdoors,

04:35.672 --> 04:37.840
which was a class "A" felony.

04:37.907 --> 04:39.842
Although she felt
the law unjust,

04:39.909 --> 04:42.009
she acknowledged
that she had broken it,

04:42.077 --> 04:44.679
and she nobly accepted
her punishment--

04:44.747 --> 04:46.381
to be set adrift
on Lake Michigan

04:46.449 --> 04:48.182
like a human popsicle.

04:48.250 --> 04:51.152
Look how calm she looks.
That's how I feel--

04:51.220 --> 04:52.687
totally zen.

04:52.755 --> 04:54.422
Ms. Knope, on what day

04:54.490 --> 04:57.124
did your relationship
with Ben Wyatt begin?

04:57.192 --> 05:01.595
Last May, at your request,
Ben and I drove to Indianapolis

05:01.663 --> 05:03.230
to bid for the state
little league tournament.

05:03.297 --> 05:05.666
The night we returned
was the first time

05:05.734 --> 05:08.469
we kissed each other
on each other's mouths.

05:08.536 --> 05:10.136
It was excellent.

05:10.704 --> 05:13.206
That was unnecessary to add.
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

05:13.274 --> 05:14.540
Next question--

05:14.608 --> 05:17.076
did you ever receive
special treatment

05:17.143 --> 05:20.012
as a result of your relationship
with Ben Wyatt?

05:20.080 --> 05:23.916
I received adorable nicknames
and amazing back rubs.

05:23.984 --> 05:25.518
Oh, you mean professionally.
No.

05:25.586 --> 05:28.821
And did you break any local,
state, or federal law

05:28.889 --> 05:31.623
in an effort to cover up your
relationship with Ben Wyatt?

05:31.691 --> 05:34.158
Absolutely not.

05:34.226 --> 05:36.127
Thank you.
Ms. Knope, that is all.

05:36.195 --> 05:38.329
Mr. Traeger, this says you're
gonna be calling 14 witnesses.

05:38.398 --> 05:39.731
Is that correct?

05:39.799 --> 05:40.932
Uh, yes, sir.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.333
14?
Why so many?

05:42.402 --> 05:44.469
I've already admitted
that I broke your rule.

05:44.537 --> 05:46.737
It's not my rule, Leslie.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.607
It is an important rule
that exists in every government.

05:49.674 --> 05:51.008
Romantic relationships

05:51.075 --> 05:53.010
between superiors
and their employees

05:53.077 --> 05:55.413
lead to fraud, corruption,
and misuse of public funds.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.847
And you think
I'm guilty of that?

05:56.915 --> 05:58.449
I think that you began
your relationship

05:58.517 --> 06:00.250
with Ben Wyatt
earlier than you're saying.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.452
I believe that you certainly
received special treatment,

06:02.520 --> 06:05.021
and I think that you may even
be guilty of bribery.

06:05.088 --> 06:06.623
None of those things
are true.

06:06.690 --> 06:09.426
And I will prove it,
Mr. Traeger.

06:09.493 --> 06:11.360
Okay, ten-minute break please.

06:11.429 --> 06:12.695
Here you go, boss.

06:12.763 --> 06:15.632
Okay, guys, we need
to counter every charge

06:15.699 --> 06:17.466
that Chris has leveled
against me.

06:17.534 --> 06:19.100
- Andy, I need evidence.
- Got it!

06:19.168 --> 06:20.936
Wait! You don't know
what evidence.

06:21.003 --> 06:22.404
Ah, right on. Yes.
Hit me.

06:22.472 --> 06:24.772
Next to my desk is a picture
of a female politician--

06:24.840 --> 06:25.641
Bella Abzug.

06:25.708 --> 06:27.576
Get the key that's taped
to the back of that picture.

06:27.644 --> 06:28.911
It opens up
my bottom desk drawer

06:28.978 --> 06:30.646
in there are some files--
pay attention.

06:30.713 --> 06:32.213
Where are you looking?
Look here, focus here.

06:32.281 --> 06:33.682
Get the files in the drawer,

06:33.750 --> 06:35.283
and then get all the file boxes
in the office.

06:35.351 --> 06:36.584
Put the files in the drawer.
Let's go.

06:36.652 --> 06:38.619
- No.
- Okay, I'll go with him.

06:38.687 --> 06:40.322
Thank you.
Ron, Chris has 14 witnesses.

06:40.389 --> 06:41.957
I need you to talk
to all the department heads

06:42.024 --> 06:43.325
and find out
who's gonna testify.

06:43.392 --> 06:45.460
I don't know the names
of the other department heads.

06:45.527 --> 06:47.562
I'll go with him. Seriously?
With the men in this office?

06:47.629 --> 06:48.063
- Ann?
- Yeah?

06:48.130 --> 06:49.664
I need you to text me
every 30 seconds

06:49.731 --> 06:51.599
- that everything's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

06:54.569 --> 06:57.271
Thanks, Ann!

06:57.339 --> 06:59.974
I broke one rule, and I will
accept a slap on the wrist.

07:00.041 --> 07:02.276
But when you sit back and let
your reputation be destroyed.

07:02.344 --> 07:06.946
You go down in history
as a frozen whore.

07:07.014 --> 07:08.314
I'm fighting.

07:09.014 --> 07:10.614
Hey, grab my computer.
I'm all set.

07:10.615 --> 07:13.044
- Great. You're up next.
- How is Ben? Is he sad?

07:13.111 --> 07:15.145
- You need to cheer him up, Ann.
- Ben is fine.

07:15.213 --> 07:16.880
He says he's sorry
he's not in here.

07:16.948 --> 07:18.716
He said to look
at the monster.

07:18.783 --> 07:20.384
I'm hoping you know
what that means.

07:20.452 --> 07:22.720
There's a rumor going around
that Chris has a killer witness.

07:22.787 --> 07:24.186
How? Why?
That makes no sense.

07:24.254 --> 07:25.521
There's no killer witness,

07:25.589 --> 07:27.022
because we didn't do
anything wrong--

07:27.090 --> 07:30.025
unless someone's planning
to lie or slander us.

07:30.093 --> 07:32.729
Okay, just to be safe, find out
who it is and silence him.

07:32.796 --> 07:35.097
- With pleasure.
- Wait. Let me make it clear.

07:35.165 --> 07:39.368
Don't silence him.
Just make sure he can't talk.

07:40.035 --> 07:41.202
Okay, we're back.

07:41.570 --> 07:42.704
Clear this chamber, please.

07:42.772 --> 07:44.973
Ms. Perkins,
Chris Traeger has questioned

07:45.040 --> 07:46.775
when my relationship
with Ben Wyatt began.

07:47.144 --> 07:49.080
I'd like to direct you
to your inbox

07:49.144 --> 07:51.680
and specifically an
email entitled "yay".

07:51.748 --> 07:55.816
That's Y-A and 18 "Y"s
and 44 exclamation points.

07:55.884 --> 07:58.819
Yes, it is an email
from you.

07:58.887 --> 08:00.254
Oh, and there's an attachment.

08:00.321 --> 08:02.189
Mm.
Intriguing.

08:02.957 --> 08:04.825
Could you play
the attachment, please?

08:04.893 --> 08:06.994
Sure.

08:07.061 --> 08:09.162
In a world on the brink

08:09.230 --> 08:12.732
of financial meltdown...

08:12.800 --> 08:17.003
In a town
unlike any other...

08:17.070 --> 08:21.574
An adorable man
with a cute face

08:21.642 --> 08:26.145
and the future president
of the United States--

08:26.213 --> 08:27.346
what?--

08:27.414 --> 08:29.915
went from being friends

08:29.982 --> 08:35.986
to being so much more.

08:36.054 --> 08:39.625
Ann! Ben and I hooked up
last night! Aah!

08:39.692 --> 08:41.559
And I learned
how to use iMovie.

08:41.628 --> 08:44.429
Call me later! Bye!

08:44.496 --> 08:46.831
So what was the date
you received that email?

08:46.899 --> 08:49.801
- Uh, May 12th.
- May 12th...

08:49.868 --> 08:52.837
The day after we returned
from Indianapolis.

08:54.940 --> 08:56.507
Mr. Haverford,

08:56.575 --> 08:59.143
would you consider
Leslie Knope a good employee?

08:59.210 --> 09:01.611
Did Tom Ford turn around
the House of Gucci?

09:01.679 --> 09:03.780
I do not know, but I'll
assume that that is a yes.

09:03.848 --> 09:04.948
How long were you two lovers?

09:05.015 --> 09:06.483
- Excuse me?
- Oh, God.

09:06.551 --> 09:08.819
Last march, I witnessed

09:08.886 --> 09:11.488
Leslie Knope
and Tom Haverford

09:11.556 --> 09:14.825
engaged in a passionate
yet tender kiss.

09:14.892 --> 09:17.660
It seems that Ms. Knope
has a pattern

09:17.727 --> 09:19.929
of becoming involved
with her co-workers.

09:19.996 --> 09:22.164
Tom, will you please tell
the committee

09:22.231 --> 09:23.766
why we were kissing?

09:23.834 --> 09:27.436
An online dating site
randomly paired us up.

09:27.504 --> 09:29.672
So, as a joke,
I thought it would be funny

09:29.739 --> 09:32.507
to pretend
you and I were dating.

09:32.575 --> 09:35.443
And then you kissed me
as a joke...

09:35.511 --> 09:36.845
To shut me up.

09:36.912 --> 09:39.714
But we never had any other
romantic contact after that.

09:39.782 --> 09:42.951
No, that would be like dating
my older sister's elderly aunt.

09:43.018 --> 09:45.052
No, it wouldn't.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.754
Well, we've been at it
for hours.

09:46.822 --> 09:49.055
And I did have some problem
with my character witnesses.

09:49.123 --> 09:50.691
I don't know why
Leslie Knope's on trial.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.559
Ethel Beavers did it!

09:52.627 --> 09:54.327
- Beavers did it!
- Sit down.

09:54.395 --> 09:56.830
I will hold myself
in contempt of the court!

09:56.898 --> 09:58.699
Is this about the laptop?
I didn't mean to steal it.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.533
I took it home, and I spaced.
I forgot.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.602
I'm gonna bring it back.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.470
It totally works, but I got
spaghetti in the keyboard.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.206
What laptop?

10:07.773 --> 10:08.708
Objection.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.544
But other than that,
I think I'm winning.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.946
I've refuted every one
of Chris' claims so far.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.917
I have here a receipt
from Pawnee Supersuites Motel.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.586
Leslie Knope submitted
that receipt for reimbursement.

10:21.654 --> 10:25.557
Taxpayers' money is not meant
to be spent on a romantic getaway.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.693
Donna, will you please
describe what we were wearing

10:28.761 --> 10:30.595
the evening you saw us?

10:30.663 --> 10:33.197
Um, khakis
and button-down shirts--

10:33.265 --> 10:34.733
your basic
white people clothes.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.734
And when you walked into
the room, what did it look like?

10:36.801 --> 10:38.002
Did it look like anything
romantic had happened?

10:38.069 --> 10:39.102
Oh, hell, no.

10:39.170 --> 10:42.039
I have ruined my share
of hotel rooms,

10:42.106 --> 10:44.307
and trust me, nothing sexual
happened in that room.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.076
It kind of looked
like an office.

10:46.144 --> 10:47.945
Maybe because
it was an office.

10:48.013 --> 10:50.714
City Hall
was being fumigated,

10:50.782 --> 10:52.615
and we need to pull
an all-nighter.

10:52.683 --> 10:54.884
The only thing
that was ravaged

10:54.952 --> 10:57.587
were these
federal grant proposals

10:57.655 --> 10:59.789
that Donna had dropped off
earlier.

10:59.857 --> 11:02.091
I've seen over 200 episodes
of <i>Law & Order,</i>

11:02.159 --> 11:03.927
and it's paying off big-time.

11:03.994 --> 11:07.796
And by the way,
we got the gramps--

11:07.864 --> 11:10.032
grants.
God! Oh.

11:10.099 --> 11:12.133
It was gonna be
such an awesome moment.

11:12.501 --> 11:14.871
So, Ethel, you've been to a
million of these ethics trials.

11:14.939 --> 11:18.974
- What do you think my chances are?
- I'd say it's 50/50.

11:19.042 --> 11:22.410
You want to put money on it,
I'll give you 60/40 against.

11:22.478 --> 11:24.312
Is it ethical
for a court stenographer

11:24.380 --> 11:25.813
to bet on the outcome
of a hearing?

11:25.881 --> 11:27.215
You tell me.

11:27.283 --> 11:28.916
You're the one on trial.

11:28.984 --> 11:32.954
Ron Swanson
to the stand, please.

11:33.021 --> 11:35.290
Mr. Swanson,
there has been a question posed

11:35.357 --> 11:37.559
about when my relationship
with Ben Wyatt ended.

11:37.626 --> 11:39.160
Can you confirm
that you own a cabin

11:39.228 --> 11:41.495
- at 930--
- Ah!

11:41.563 --> 11:42.963
Stop, please.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.965
I don't like to give out
my address to anyone,

11:45.032 --> 11:47.134
much less have it
on an official record.

11:47.202 --> 11:49.236
Ron, don't be ridiculous.
This is very important.

11:49.304 --> 11:51.671
- Do you own a cabin--
- Ah!

11:51.739 --> 11:54.007
9301 Cedarcrest Dr--

11:54.075 --> 11:56.242
- 9301 Cedarcrest Dr--
- Beep!

11:56.310 --> 11:57.810
I didn't hear that.

11:57.877 --> 12:00.346
9301 Cedarcrest Drive!

12:04.918 --> 12:06.852
She's here.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.020
Who's here?

12:08.088 --> 12:10.523
My ex-wife--Tammy two.

12:10.591 --> 12:13.191
I can smell the sulfur
coming off her cloven hooves.

12:13.259 --> 12:15.293
Good nose, Ron.
Tammy Swanson is here.

12:15.361 --> 12:16.628
She'll be my next witness.

12:16.695 --> 12:19.030
Tammy two is
your killer witness?

12:19.098 --> 12:20.865
Please! You're gonna have
to do better--

12:20.933 --> 12:22.700
Actually, she is
a terrifying sociopath

12:22.768 --> 12:24.836
who could say or do anything--

12:25.903 --> 12:27.038
A pretty good killer witness.

12:27.106 --> 12:29.873
Ms. Swanson, do you,
as you claimed,

12:29.941 --> 12:31.609
have evidence linking

12:31.676 --> 12:33.611
Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt
to law breaking?

12:33.678 --> 12:34.612
Absolutely.

12:34.679 --> 12:36.013
I have several photographs

12:36.080 --> 12:37.881
that will definitively prove--

12:37.949 --> 12:39.550
May I remind you
that you are under oath,

12:39.618 --> 12:41.685
and if you lie, I will fire you
and have you prosecuted.

12:41.753 --> 12:42.886
Nothing.

12:42.954 --> 12:44.987
They will definitively
prove nothing.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.456
You cut me off.

12:46.524 --> 12:48.358
I don't have any evidence.

12:48.425 --> 12:50.059
Oh, Chris-- so silly.

12:50.127 --> 12:51.394
Okay, bye, guys.

12:51.462 --> 12:53.229
Leslie, have fun
with this trial.

12:53.297 --> 12:55.831
Yay!

12:55.899 --> 12:59.902
I think I've proven that
the only rule Ben and I broke

12:59.970 --> 13:01.970
was dating each other.

13:02.038 --> 13:04.373
And I am very happy
that I have not uncovered

13:04.440 --> 13:06.642
any additional evidence
of unethical behavior.

13:06.709 --> 13:08.310
But I-I do have
one last witness--

13:08.378 --> 13:10.345
George Williams
from Public Works.

13:10.413 --> 13:14.816
George Williams?
Who's--

13:14.884 --> 13:16.417
Oh, George Williams--

13:16.485 --> 13:19.320
He's just a maintenance worker,
NASCAR enthusiast, I believe.

13:19.388 --> 13:21.021
And, oh, interesting tidbit--

13:21.089 --> 13:24.592
I once bribed him to keep
my relationship with Ben quiet.

13:26.124 --> 13:29.553
You're saying that you saw
Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope

13:29.554 --> 13:31.255
kissing at Li'l Sebastian's
memorial?

13:31.323 --> 13:32.589
Yeah!

13:32.657 --> 13:35.459
Can you identify Leslie Knope
in this chamber?

13:35.527 --> 13:37.928
- She's right there.
- Right--

13:38.396 --> 13:41.031
And what happened
after this incident?

13:41.098 --> 13:42.598
Well, I got real nervous.

13:42.666 --> 13:45.200
They came up to me, and they
told me to forget what I saw.

13:45.268 --> 13:48.237
What you saw was not
what you think it is.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.640
I have a gift certificate,
actually, for you.

13:50.707 --> 13:52.107
Oh, my God.

13:52.175 --> 13:54.276
And then they gave me
a $50 gift certificate

13:54.344 --> 13:55.545
to a spa and said...

13:55.612 --> 13:58.780
And thank you
for your discretion.

13:58.848 --> 14:00.549
- And did you use it?
- Yeah.

14:00.616 --> 14:01.950
I got a facial.

14:02.017 --> 14:04.319
My wife said my skin
was luminous.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.587
That's enough.

14:05.655 --> 14:07.088
Now, in order to cover up
their illicit affair,

14:07.156 --> 14:10.659
Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope
bribed a city employee.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.494
George, I notice
that you're wearing glasses,

14:12.562 --> 14:14.362
yet on the day in question,

14:14.430 --> 14:16.163
I don't recall you
wearing glasses.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.732
Could it be because
you weren't wearing glasses?

14:18.800 --> 14:20.100
I never wear 'em
on the job.

14:20.168 --> 14:22.402
Can you take
your glasses off, please,

14:22.471 --> 14:23.904
and read this for us?

14:23.972 --> 14:26.874
"I could read this
if I weren't so blind."

14:26.942 --> 14:28.609
Well, that went terribly.

14:28.677 --> 14:31.077
I need to check
some facts and figures.

14:31.144 --> 14:32.846
I would like to request
a 55-day recess.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.614
You can have 30 minutes,

14:34.682 --> 14:38.184
but we're nearing
the end here, Ms. Knope.

14:38.251 --> 14:40.854
Okay, guys, my only hope is
that in one of these old books,

14:40.921 --> 14:42.589
there's some weird, arcane
statute or government rule

14:42.656 --> 14:43.923
that helps me.

14:43.991 --> 14:47.459
So everybody grab a volume,
and let's just read up.

14:47.527 --> 14:49.761
Okay, mine doesn't have
any pictures.

14:50.329 --> 14:53.866
Does anyone have anything?
Did anybody find anything good?

14:53.933 --> 14:57.769
In 1856, the city council
banned all sexual positions

14:57.837 --> 14:59.771
except for missionary.

14:59.839 --> 15:02.240
And two years later,
they banned missionary.

15:02.308 --> 15:04.942
1882, should a presbyterian
speak out of turn,

15:05.010 --> 15:06.711
he may be caned
across the shinbone.

15:06.778 --> 15:08.078
Oh, my God.

15:08.146 --> 15:10.748
Black people still can't legally
use city sidewalks.

15:10.816 --> 15:12.984
Look, I know we're not
supposed to be seen together,

15:13.051 --> 15:14.852
but I think Ben could be
really helpful with this.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.287
- Can somebody go get him?
- All right, I'll go.

15:17.355 --> 15:20.423
"Any woman caught laughing
is a witch."

15:20.491 --> 15:22.191
That's true.

15:22.259 --> 15:23.660
Um, he's not there.

15:23.728 --> 15:26.162
No, he said he'd just be
on the other side of that wall.

15:26.230 --> 15:28.665
- He's probably in the bathroom.
- All right, I'll find him.

15:36.372 --> 15:39.975
This mural is called
<i>Bad Pawnee, Good Pawnee.</i>

15:40.043 --> 15:41.510
All the terrible things
that have happened

15:41.578 --> 15:43.746
in this town's history
are on one side.

15:43.813 --> 15:46.048
And on the other side
are all the good things

15:46.115 --> 15:47.616
that have happened.

15:47.684 --> 15:49.251
I'm on the bad side.

15:49.318 --> 15:51.318
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am, Ron.

15:51.386 --> 15:53.555
I'm guilty.
I did something bad.

15:53.622 --> 15:56.090
I'm a bad person.

15:56.158 --> 15:58.760
It's not that simple.

15:58.827 --> 16:02.096
You know what makes
a good person good?

16:02.164 --> 16:04.265
When a good person
does something bad,

16:04.332 --> 16:06.267
they own up to it.

16:06.334 --> 16:10.303
They try to learn something
from it, and they move on.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.775
Guys, everybody stop reading--

16:14.842 --> 16:16.677
no more loopholes,
no more fighting.

16:16.744 --> 16:17.844
Are you sure, boss?

16:17.912 --> 16:19.613
Yeah.
I know I let you down.

16:19.681 --> 16:21.715
And I just want to say
I'm really sorry.

16:21.783 --> 16:23.282
Leslie, what are you
talking about?

16:23.349 --> 16:24.750
Yeah, this makes me
like you more.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.053
Bribing someone to hide
a sexcapade--

16:27.120 --> 16:28.420
I'm proud
to call you a friend.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.089
And I always liked you.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.157
Okay, we're back.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.860
Clear the chamber, please.

16:34.928 --> 16:38.763
I think I'm about
to get fired, Ron.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.666
Ms. Knope, unless you have
any objections,

16:41.734 --> 16:43.401
we'll be ending
this investigation

16:43.469 --> 16:46.071
and moving on
to the punishment phase.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.239
I have no objections.

16:48.307 --> 16:51.409
We hereby hand down
the following judgment.

16:51.477 --> 16:54.412
You will be suspended
for two weeks with pay.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.180
- Just two weeks?
- Correct.

16:57.248 --> 16:59.850
This concludes
the investigation.

17:02.153 --> 17:04.253
I thought
I was gonna get fired.

17:04.321 --> 17:06.556
I should've gotten fired.
Why didn't I get fired?

17:07.125 --> 17:10.594
Ben asked for a private
meeting with the committee,

17:10.661 --> 17:13.762
and he took full responsibility
for the bribe

17:13.830 --> 17:15.932
and resigned,
effective immediately.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.266
What?
Wait. Hang on.

17:17.334 --> 17:19.102
You can't let him resign.

17:19.169 --> 17:20.936
I tried to talk him
out of it, but...

17:21.005 --> 17:24.073
His mind was made up.

17:24.141 --> 17:26.407
Look, my job is to protect
the government

17:26.476 --> 17:29.410
from fraud and corruption.

17:29.478 --> 17:31.546
I was just doing my job.

17:31.614 --> 17:33.949
I hope that
you can understand that.

17:34.017 --> 17:35.483
I do.

17:35.551 --> 17:36.818
Honestly, I do.

17:36.886 --> 17:38.820
'Cause your actions
wounded me to my core,

17:38.888 --> 17:40.956
which is not easy
since the bulk of my workouts

17:41.024 --> 17:43.891
are focused
on core strengthening.

17:43.959 --> 17:46.727
But we will get through this.
You are...

17:46.795 --> 17:48.595
An excellent
government employee.

17:48.664 --> 17:50.397
And more importantly,

17:50.465 --> 17:52.232
you're the only person
I've ever met who's worthy

17:52.300 --> 17:54.902
of being Ben's girlfriend.

17:54.970 --> 17:56.671
I hope that's true.

17:59.674 --> 18:02.175
You know, the meeting
that Ben and I had--

18:02.242 --> 18:04.077
it's on the record.

18:04.145 --> 18:06.979
You should take a look at the
last page of the transcript.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.386
"Mr. Wyatt:
Chris, for God's sake,

18:13.453 --> 18:15.654
"would you mind not jumping
for a while?"

18:15.722 --> 18:17.289
Mr. Traeger:
"Sorry, Ben, but"...

18:17.356 --> 18:19.892
This is how
I fight depression.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.160
Okay, fine.
I'll stop.

18:21.227 --> 18:22.795
Thank you.

18:22.862 --> 18:25.764
Okay, so you are prepared

18:25.832 --> 18:28.567
to resign,
effective immediately,

18:28.634 --> 18:31.335
and take full responsibility
for all the events

18:31.403 --> 18:34.038
that transpired
at Li'l Sebastian's memorial.

18:34.106 --> 18:36.273
- "Mr. Wyatt: That is correct."
- That is correct.

18:36.341 --> 18:37.942
"Mr. Traeger:
Okay, fine.

18:38.010 --> 18:40.411
"This makes me sadder
than I previously thought

18:40.478 --> 18:43.347
"humanly possible,
but I accept your resignation.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.649
Can I ask you
one more question?"

18:45.718 --> 18:49.152
Was all of this--
all the sneaking around,

18:49.220 --> 18:51.354
the scandal,
losing your job--

18:51.422 --> 18:53.223
Was it worth it?

18:53.290 --> 18:55.158
Yes.

18:55.226 --> 18:56.960
It was.

18:57.028 --> 18:59.229
"Because I love Leslie.
I want to be with her.

18:59.296 --> 19:00.731
"And I don't want to hide

19:00.798 --> 19:03.332
"the way I feel
about her anymore.

19:03.399 --> 19:04.666
"So, yeah, it was worth it,

19:04.735 --> 19:06.969
"because I'm in love
with Leslie Knope.

19:07.037 --> 19:09.338
"Mr. Traeger:
That was beautiful.

19:09.405 --> 19:11.640
"I'm literally crying
and jumping.

19:11.708 --> 19:15.077
"Crying noise,
crying noise, nose blow.

19:15.145 --> 19:17.012
"Mr. Wyatt:
It's gonna be okay.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.214
Mr. Traeger:..."

19:18.281 --> 19:21.249
Oh.

19:23.485 --> 19:26.054
Let it out, I guess.

19:26.122 --> 19:27.822
"End transcript."

19:33.829 --> 19:35.395
Hi, honey,
how was your day?

19:35.463 --> 19:38.431
Oh, I've had better.

19:38.499 --> 19:39.933
How about you?

19:40.001 --> 19:42.469
I can't believe
you did that for me.

19:42.536 --> 19:43.871
Well, I was pretty sure

19:43.938 --> 19:46.373
it was gonna happen
one way or the other.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.375
I hope it doesn't affect
your campaign.

19:48.442 --> 19:50.144
Don't worry about that
right now.

19:50.211 --> 19:53.146
There was a piece of testimony
that came out during the trial

19:53.213 --> 19:56.615
that I think
you'd be interested in.

19:56.683 --> 19:59.852
Ethel?

19:59.920 --> 20:02.922
Ethel, could you please read
page 132

20:02.990 --> 20:06.958
of the official testimony?

20:07.026 --> 20:09.727
"Ethel Beavers:
The official record

20:09.796 --> 20:12.697
"has now annoyingly
been reopened

20:12.765 --> 20:15.466
"so that Leslie Knope
can make a statement.

20:15.534 --> 20:20.138
"Leslie Knope: Let the record
state that I, Leslie Knope,

20:20.206 --> 20:21.773
"love Ben Wyatt.

20:21.841 --> 20:24.141
"I love him
with all of my heart.

20:24.209 --> 20:25.376
"Did you get that?

20:25.444 --> 20:28.646
Ethel Beavers:
Yes, I got it."

20:28.714 --> 20:31.382
Thank you, Ethel.

20:34.386 --> 20:37.522
Can I get a ride home?
It's freezing.

20:38.929 --> 20:41.998
Can you please state your name
for the committee?

20:43.065 --> 20:45.700
- Gary Gergich.
- Oh, God, Jerry.

20:45.768 --> 20:47.534
You can't even get
your own name right.

20:47.602 --> 20:50.004
Actually,
my real name is Gary.

20:50.571 --> 20:51.171
Gary?

20:51.239 --> 20:52.673
On my first day here,
the old director--

20:52.741 --> 20:53.907
he called me Jerry,

20:53.975 --> 20:55.809
and I just didn't think
I should correct him.

20:55.877 --> 20:57.745
That's ridiculous.
Your name is Jerry.

20:57.812 --> 20:58.812
No.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.981
Legally my name is Gary.

21:01.049 --> 21:03.182
Gary Gergich?

21:03.250 --> 21:04.651
Jerry Gergich.

21:04.718 --> 21:06.853
Gary Gergich.
Jerry Gergich.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.955
Gary Gergich. Jerry--
God, they're both horrible.

21:09.023 --> 21:12.025
But Jerry's better.
I'm gonna call you Jerry.

21:12.092 --> 21:16.696
Okay, Jerry, do you remember
a time...

21:18.265 --> 21:20.032
I'm sorry. I can't get
over the Gary/Jerry thing.

21:20.099 --> 21:21.366
Neither can I.
Jerry, you can go.

21:21.433 --> 21:22.668
We need a five-minute break.
