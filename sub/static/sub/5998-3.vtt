00:01.202 --> 00:02.868
I know this is
all of a sudden,

00:02.869 --> 00:04.535
but I want to be detailed
to arson.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.205
Welcome aboard.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.039
I'm really grateful to be
here.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.708
- You guys all right?
- Just a bad run.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.877
<i> - Young mom got shot.</i>
<i>- [woman screams]</i>

00:11.878 --> 00:14.045
<i> We delivered her baby,</i>
<i> but she didn't make it.</i>

00:14.048 --> 00:16.215
You went back to the hospital
to check on the baby?

00:16.216 --> 00:18.717
- Yeah.
<i> - Brett, you can't do that.</i>

00:18.719 --> 00:21.153
51 did nothing wrong at
that crack house fire, Chief.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.950
Move these cars. We got a house on fire!
[people shouting indistinctly]

00:23.950 --> 00:25.457
[woman] Let it burn!

00:25.459 --> 00:27.059

<i> were blocking the streets.</i>

00:27.061 --> 00:28.560
<i> Now they're saying</i>
<i> we were slow to respond.</i>

00:28.562 --> 00:31.296
If it's determined that
you slow-walked that fire,

00:31.298 --> 00:33.399
Chief Boden will be
relieved of his command.

00:38.530 --> 00:39.580
What's Severide
 doing here?

00:39.580 --> 00:40.630
I thought this was
an officers' meeting.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.540
It's a breakfast.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.270
Got it.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.880
[utensils clinking]
What did Riddle say?

00:49.880 --> 00:52.650
Keep our heads down.
The usual.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.020
Bunch of politics.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.380
How's it looking?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.790
It's not good,

00:58.790 --> 01:01.020
especially if these
accusations don't go away.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.490
Must've been 50 people
outside that fire,

01:03.490 --> 01:04.890
and not one
of them comes forward?

01:04.890 --> 01:06.360
A guy died.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.730
No one wants to take
the blame for that.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.700
Listen,
 I got you all here

01:10.700 --> 01:12.900
because I want to make
things very clear.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.470
Keep everyone in
the house out of this.

01:15.470 --> 01:18.740
Let them focus
on their jobs.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.770
- Here you go.
- I got it.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.040
No, it's already been
paid for.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.380
What?

01:24.380 --> 01:26.880
The guys in
 the back corner.

01:31.650 --> 01:32.820
[phone ringing]

01:32.820 --> 01:34.890
- Riddle's called already.
- Oh, fantastic.

01:34.890 --> 01:35.960
Reporter from
the "Sun Times" too.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.390
I told them
 no comment,

01:37.390 --> 01:40.890
and you have your meeting
with Brett right now.

01:42.530 --> 01:43.700
Right.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.970
Something wrong,
Chief?

01:49.970 --> 01:52.310
I've been meaning to
talk to you about a patient

01:52.310 --> 01:55.780
that you had,
Alicia Morales?

01:55.780 --> 01:58.710
The baby boy
that you delivered.

01:58.710 --> 02:00.610
I heard that you stopped
off at Chicago Med

02:00.620 --> 02:03.880
to pay him a visit,
more than a few times.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.350
[clears throat] Yes.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.700
I've had a few
of those myself,

02:16.700 --> 02:20.570
the ones I couldn't
save, or worse,

02:20.570 --> 02:22.700
the ones I could save
who didn't have much of a life

02:22.710 --> 02:25.370
- to go back to.
- [Brett sighs deeply]

02:25.370 --> 02:26.570
- This job:
- [Brett sighs deeply]

02:26.580 --> 02:28.940
you drop off,
you walk away.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.610
You don't do that,
you drown.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.650
[swallows] Yes, sir.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.950
Won't happen again.

Come on.

You really got him busting
his hump, Lieutenant.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.680
- Kid's got potential.
- Yeah.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.120
Might be the best candidate
I've seen come through here.

My husband... he
was unloading the thing.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.130
It just fell.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.430
- What's your name?
- Tricia.

Okay, Tricia,
let's take a look.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.130

I'm Lieutenant Casey.
What's your name?

04:00.740 --> 04:03.100
- Steve.
- What happened here, Steve?

04:03.110 --> 04:06.440
Cable... snapped.
[zip sound]

04:06.440 --> 04:08.180
Doesn't hurt as much
as you'd think.

Steve?

Hey, hey, 
stay with me.

Oh, my God,
what's happening to him?

04:14.150 --> 04:15.580
Breathing's agonal.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.019
Looks like an arterial bleed
in the leg.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.550
Irregular heartbeat.
Possibly A-fib.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.170
I'm really worried
about crush syndrome.

04:21.170 --> 04:22.790
- What does that mean?
- Secure an airway and intubate.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.720
I'll get the tourniquet
and IV going.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.590
All right,
let's move over here.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.760

 this here is Jimmy.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.570
He's gonna keep you updated
on the situation.

You've got the best people
in the city working on this.

04:40.140 --> 04:42.710
I promise you that.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.880
All right, we're gonna
get 4x4 cribbing and airbags.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.210
You got to dig around it.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.480
Get a big enough gap to lift
up the pod

04:47.480 --> 04:48.480
and slide his leg out.

- You can't lift that off of him.
- What?

05:22.850 --> 05:24.580
He's going into
crush syndrome.

05:24.590 --> 05:28.820
As soon as you release the limb,
he's going into cardiac arrest.

If we're gonna save
 this guy,

05:30.690 --> 05:32.560

have to leave the leg behind.

Okay, call Chicago Med.

 cardiac arrest.

No.

making me cry. [chuckles]

11:13.130 --> 11:14.630
Hormones.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.200
I meant to tell you: doctor's
appointment on the 12th.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.910
Mm-hmm.

11:19.910 --> 11:23.080
They said that we'll be able
to hear the baby's heartbeat.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.650
- Wow.
- I know, right?

11:26.650 --> 11:28.620
- This is real.
- This is real.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.980
[Mouch] Knock it off.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.420
[Herrmann] Hey, Gabby,
what you doing here?

11:31.420 --> 11:33.190
- Miss us yet?
- Uh...

11:33.190 --> 11:34.220
Some of you.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.360
Ouch.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.490
Tricia,
what are you doing here?

11:38.490 --> 11:40.660
- How's your husband holding up?
- Made it out of surgery.

11:40.660 --> 11:43.230
They think he's gonna
be all right.

11:43.230 --> 11:45.130
That's great.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.070
Is there someone
I can talk to?

11:47.070 --> 11:49.600
It's about the
 24th Street fire.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.140
I think I have something
that can help.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.240
My Bobby... he's 13.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.610
They film everything
with their stupid phones.

11:59.610 --> 12:01.680
Half the time, you're yelling
at them to put it down,

12:01.680 --> 12:03.350
talk to you.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.950
This time,
I'm glad he didn't.

12:05.950 --> 12:08.420
This is the
 crack house fire?

12:08.420 --> 12:11.160
When I saw all that stuff
in the papers about you guys,

12:11.160 --> 12:13.330
I just had to show
 someone.

12:13.330 --> 12:14.460
Bobby got it all.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.200
You see the street's
 blocked,

12:16.200 --> 12:18.330
no one helping
you move those cars.

12:18.330 --> 12:21.500
<i>[Herrmann's voice] Who owns
 these cars?</i>

12:21.500 --> 12:23.600
<i> Move these cars.</i>
<i> We got a house on fire!</i>

12:23.610 --> 12:25.200
<i>[woman] Let it burn!</i>

12:25.210 --> 12:26.670
<i> [crowd yelling]</i>

12:26.680 --> 12:29.280
Everyone thinks one
of us set that fire.

12:29.280 --> 12:34.950
It's not true, but you guys
did everything you could.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.090
You don't deserve
the blame either.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.350
Tricia, thank you.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.060
My husband wouldn't
be alive with you.

12:44.060 --> 12:47.530
I hope it helps.

12:47.530 --> 12:50.130
More than you can
possibly imagine.

12:50.130 --> 12:53.300
<i>[Herrmann's voice] Which one
 of these is yours?</i>

12:53.300 --> 12:56.300
<i>[overlapping chat from video]</i>

13:02.210 --> 13:04.710
What is it?

13:04.710 --> 13:05.750
You know how I keep
hitting walls

13:05.750 --> 13:07.210
in the arson investigation?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.650
Mm-hmm.

13:09.650 --> 13:14.050
What if the neighbors
didn't set that fire?

13:15.760 --> 13:17.390
<i>We need these cars
 moved now!</i>

13:17.390 --> 13:20.290
<i>- Now!</i>
<i> - [woman] We don't want you here.</i>

13:27.270 --> 13:29.540
Remind me again
why I'm leaving your bed

13:29.540 --> 13:32.640
to go to an office
 that I hate?

13:32.640 --> 13:36.340
You know, I really don't have
a good answer for that.

13:36.340 --> 13:39.680
You're not very helpful.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.450
Maybe things will
turn around at work.

13:43.450 --> 13:44.780
I think we should
just be happy

13:44.790 --> 13:47.590
that one of us
is out of trouble.

13:47.590 --> 13:50.660
That video could really
bail your asses out.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.260
Just in time, too.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.560
Was starting to lose
my faith in humanity.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.430
And then
 you met me.

13:59.430 --> 14:03.430
[smooches]

14:05.310 --> 14:06.510
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

14:06.510 --> 14:07.610
Okay.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.000
Oh, hi.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.250
I'm Jamie. I'm Kelly's friend,
not robbing the place.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.290
Gabby.

14:22.290 --> 14:26.830
Kelly let you wear
his Jonathan Toews jersey, huh?

14:26.830 --> 14:29.430
I'm not really
a football person.

14:29.430 --> 14:32.130
Hockey.

14:32.130 --> 14:34.800
Right.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.670
You're not from
Chicago, are you?

14:36.670 --> 14:40.110
No, San Diego.

14:40.110 --> 14:43.380
Is that about
the 24th Street fire?

14:43.380 --> 14:46.250
Kelly was telling me.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.750
Yeah, it is.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.650
Roger Maddox, huh?

14:50.650 --> 14:52.120
You heard of him?

14:52.120 --> 14:54.850
Yeah, sure, he's
a big property developer.

14:54.860 --> 14:57.560
Supposed to be
 a real scumbag.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.660
Good to know.

15:01.830 --> 15:03.860
Uh, got to get to work.
It was nice to meet you.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.170
You, too.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.800
Wait.

15:10.810 --> 15:15.110
So not all the girls
get to wear the jersey?

15:18.850 --> 15:20.380
Hmm.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.190
Borrelli, 
come here a sec.

15:28.190 --> 15:29.590
Clean the truck 
by lunch.

15:29.590 --> 15:32.130
I want to see my face
in that bumper.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.260
Yes, sir, on it.

15:34.260 --> 15:37.130
Lieutenant.

15:37.130 --> 15:39.280
Danny, right?

15:39.280 --> 15:41.430
Yeah, can I get a minute
to talk to my brother?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.540
Yeah, of course.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.510
Oh, hey, 
that's right.

15:47.510 --> 15:50.580
We got Captain RFC here,
ready for close-up.

15:50.580 --> 15:53.710
You never met a camera
you didn't like, huh, Captain?

15:54.220 --> 15:56.220
[chuckles]

15:56.220 --> 15:58.250
Come on, Danny.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.820
Jagoff.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.930
This place is going
straight down the tubes.

16:05.930 --> 16:07.730
Lucky for you,
you're getting out.

16:07.730 --> 16:09.260
- What?
- I asked the District Chief

16:09.260 --> 16:11.230
about moving you to 67.

16:11.230 --> 16:12.900
Everything going on here...
you can't exactly say no.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.300
I got to talk to Boden.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.640
No, no, no,
don't talk to Boden.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.670
Don't talk to anybody.
I got it handled.

16:17.670 --> 16:19.410
I'll let you know
when it happens.

16:19.410 --> 16:21.270
You stay alive.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.680
Keep your head down,
you hear me?

16:28.680 --> 16:30.250
[Chilton] Do you think it's too early
to start planning

16:30.250 --> 16:31.680
a baby shower
 for Dawson?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.450
I want to make cupcakes.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.890
[radio crackles]
 Earth to Indiana,

16:38.890 --> 16:40.200
can I get a
 little help here?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.530
[laughs]

16:41.530 --> 16:44.260
Hey, what do pregnant
chicks like?

16:44.270 --> 16:49.600
I don't know,
cakes made out of diapers.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.800
Why the hell would you
make a cake out of a diaper?

16:51.810 --> 16:54.940
Can we talk about
something else?

16:56.840 --> 17:00.410
Want to talk
about that baby?

17:00.420 --> 17:03.450
You really don't think
I know what you're doing.

17:03.450 --> 17:06.319
You're sneaking off to the
hospital every chance you get.

17:06.319 --> 17:10.460
You know, DCFS is gonna
take control in, like, two days.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.260
Who knows what's gonna
happen to him?

17:12.260 --> 17:15.359
Brett, you got
 to let it go.

17:15.359 --> 17:16.430
It's not healthy.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.400
It's getting in the way
of your work.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.000
I'm fine.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.230
I'm totally fine.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.339
Yeah, I can see that.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.770
<i>[over radio] 61, take a sick person</i>
<i> at 4321 Wilcox.</i>

17:30.280 --> 17:32.550
61 to Main, en route.
[engine starts]

17:32.550 --> 17:35.620
[siren wailing]

17:49.830 --> 17:52.400
Hey, are you sure
we have the right address?

17:52.400 --> 17:54.570
4321.

17:54.570 --> 17:57.270
Hey, anybody there?

18:00.010 --> 18:01.340
Did you call
an ambulance, sir?

18:01.340 --> 18:03.610
Yeah, yeah, 
come inside.

18:03.610 --> 18:04.740
Hey, Brett.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.750
Brett! Brett!

18:10.390 --> 18:12.550
Are you hurt, sir?

18:12.550 --> 18:16.320
Drop your radios.
[radio chirps]

18:16.320 --> 18:19.290
Now!

18:19.290 --> 18:21.630
<i>[over radio] Booth trying
 to reach Main.</i>

18:22.030 --> 18:24.530
[bags thud]

18:24.530 --> 18:27.430
In there.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.490
Move.
[radio chirps]

18:29.490 --> 18:31.540
<i>[over radio] Is someone out there</i>
<i> trying to reach Main?</i>

18:33.470 --> 18:34.940
<i> Is someone calling Main?</i>

18:37.040 --> 18:40.040
[Brett gasping]

18:40.440 --> 18:42.440
[coughs]

18:45.750 --> 18:48.790
[groaning]

18:52.560 --> 18:54.790
Fix him.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.830
[groans]

18:56.830 --> 18:59.700
Sir, can you
 hear me?

18:59.700 --> 19:03.700
Sir?
Sir, can you hear me?

19:03.710 --> 19:07.440
Shallow breathing.
Pulse is weak and thready.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.770
He's losing
 a lot of blood.

19:08.780 --> 19:09.880
Blade could've
nicked the heart,

19:09.880 --> 19:11.840
lacerated the spleen
 or liver.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.580
He needs to go
into surgery now.

19:13.580 --> 19:14.810
We need to take him
to the hospital.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.520
No, no hospitals,
 no cops.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.090
We don't care
what you're doing in here.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.620
It's our job
to save this guy's life.

19:20.620 --> 19:21.950
Shut up.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.360
We got to get
 an IV going.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.490
Listen to your friend.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.860
He is gonna die here,
and you know it.

19:33.070 --> 19:34.470
She's right.

19:34.470 --> 19:35.840
We have to take him
to a hospital.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.540
I said no hospitals.

19:38.540 --> 19:41.010
Look, this is just
an anonymous sick person call.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.580
No one knows
 we're here.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.710
Just let us transport him
to the hospital.

19:44.710 --> 19:46.610
You called us
 for a reason.

19:46.610 --> 19:47.780
I know you don't
want him to die.

19:47.780 --> 19:51.120
- Shut up! Get back to work.
- No.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.120
Brett!

19:52.120 --> 19:53.620
You can shoot me,

19:53.620 --> 19:55.420
or you can let us go
take him to the hospital

19:55.420 --> 19:56.890
so we can save
 his life.

19:56.890 --> 19:59.590
Two choices, that's it.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.430
Do it.

20:03.430 --> 20:05.900
Do it or let us go.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.780
You're totally fine, huh?

20:24.450 --> 20:25.990
Corn muffin?
Baked them this morning.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.990
You're gonna
want to hear this.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.720
I met with the lady.
She's telling the truth.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.460
So if one of the neighbors
didn't set the fire, who did?

20:33.460 --> 20:35.160
I went down there.
I talked to the building owner.

20:35.160 --> 20:39.570
It turns out he just accepted
an offer on the property.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.900
Buyer's name is
 Roger Maddox.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.440
Seemed a little quick,
 right?

20:43.440 --> 20:46.640
So I did some digging.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.680
Maddox bought four arson
buildings in the last year,

20:50.680 --> 20:52.980
all in gentrifying neighborhoods
where the property value

20:52.980 --> 20:54.850
at least doubled.

20:54.850 --> 20:57.020
If he's not setting
the fires himself,

20:57.020 --> 20:59.450
that's a hell of
 a coincidence.

20:59.450 --> 21:01.050
Let me see
 what you got.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.740
Nice job.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.800
Hell yeah.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.810
No, the other file.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.910
Oh, right.

21:35.220 --> 21:37.990
We're gonna need to reexamine
all the other old files,

21:37.990 --> 21:40.560
try building a case
against this guy.

21:42.030 --> 21:43.260
All due respect,

21:43.260 --> 21:45.000
there's enough here
to bring him in to CPD,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.030
at least
 question him.

21:46.030 --> 21:47.500
Sweetheart,

21:47.500 --> 21:49.600
we're talking about accusing
someone of murder.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.700
You're gonna need
a lot more than whatever's

21:51.710 --> 21:53.540
in the cardboard box.

21:53.540 --> 21:57.040
I'm with Suzie.
This is a great start.

22:04.890 --> 22:08.550
So she was here alone,
no family, nothing?

22:08.560 --> 22:12.860
I guess she followed a
boyfriend to Chicago last year.

22:12.860 --> 22:15.830
Is he the father?

22:15.830 --> 22:18.130
Hospital has attempted
to contact him,

22:18.130 --> 22:20.970
but he's not calling back.

22:20.970 --> 22:23.170
Well, what's his name?

22:23.170 --> 22:25.600
Can't tell you that.

22:31.010 --> 22:34.280
Why are you really coming
by to see this baby?

22:37.720 --> 22:39.020
I told you.

22:39.020 --> 22:41.050
I delivered him.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.590
I know.

22:45.590 --> 22:50.730
I know you're supposed to just
drop the patient off, walk away.

22:50.730 --> 22:53.330
I've heard it
 a million times.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.670
But this one...

23:04.850 --> 23:07.880
You know,
 that duty nurse...

23:07.880 --> 23:09.350
it's weird, like clockwork.

23:09.350 --> 23:12.690
Every day at 1:00 pm,
she has a coffee break.

23:12.690 --> 23:15.090
You know, I see her
outside on her bench.

23:15.090 --> 23:20.290
I would never, ever advocate
this course of action, but,

23:20.290 --> 23:24.760
you know, you pop the patient
code into the computer,

23:24.770 --> 23:29.130
you never know
what you might find out.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.070
Right.

23:31.070 --> 23:34.810
But then,
 you walk away.

23:36.740 --> 23:39.080
I walk away.

23:48.380 --> 23:52.380
[saw buzzing]

23:54.260 --> 23:56.830
Right, kill the saw.

23:56.830 --> 23:59.670
Kill the saw!
Doesn't work.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.170
What do you mean?
It's working just fine.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.940
I told you
 it doesn't work.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.170
What do you do?

24:12.710 --> 24:14.010
Machines fail.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.980
Men don't.

24:16.980 --> 24:20.420
Anyone can do it
the easy way.

24:22.690 --> 24:25.330
[grunting]

24:32.230 --> 24:35.070
Lucky you, let's go.

24:40.570 --> 24:42.570
[truck door closes]

24:42.570 --> 24:43.640
Damn.

24:43.640 --> 24:44.910
You know you got
a better chance

24:44.910 --> 24:47.050
of being hit by
a truck, right?

24:47.050 --> 24:49.150
People get hit
by trucks every day.

24:49.150 --> 24:52.890
Otherwise,
 we'd be out of a job.

24:52.890 --> 24:55.720
Elevator's stuck.
This could be fun.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.720
Nope,
 these are yawners, kid.

24:58.730 --> 24:59.730
Wait and you'll see.

24:59.730 --> 25:02.860
[siren wails]

25:11.440 --> 25:13.070
Family's in
 elevator four.

25:13.070 --> 25:14.070
Got a little girl.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.270
We've been trying to
get it going

25:15.280 --> 25:16.310
for a couple of hours.
No luck.

25:16.310 --> 25:17.840
We finally had
 to call you.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.240
You try prying 
open the doors?

25:19.250 --> 25:21.100
Car's stopped
on the 25th floor,

25:21.100 --> 25:22.230
but it's an express.

25:22.230 --> 25:25.250
There's not another
opening till the 30th.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.050
All right, stairs, guys.

25:34.960 --> 25:38.060
All right, I got you.

25:38.060 --> 25:40.060
[sliding doors rolling]

25:40.060 --> 25:42.060
[doors clang]
[sound echoes]

25:43.970 --> 25:45.070
Whoa.

25:48.780 --> 25:50.780
Okay, maybe not
 so boring.

25:50.780 --> 25:53.150
Lieutenant, car's about
50 feet down.

25:53.150 --> 25:55.180
Squad,
 what's your ETA?

25:55.180 --> 25:57.820
We got a rope rescue.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.150
Hello, anybody hear me?

25:59.150 --> 26:00.790
<i> [over speaker] Yeah,
 we're here.</i>

26:00.790 --> 26:02.190
You got CFD
 on the line.

26:02.190 --> 26:04.320
We're gonna get you
out of there, try to stay calm.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.060
<i>[over speaker] My daughter, she's having</i>
<i> an asthma attack.</i>

26:07.060 --> 26:09.760
<i> We don't have the inhaler.</i>

26:09.760 --> 26:11.530
Get her taking
long, slow breaths.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.400
Paramedics are on the way.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.870
Got an 8-year-old
with a severe asthma attack

26:15.870 --> 26:17.240

26:17.240 --> 26:18.240
Patterson's
at the academy.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.840
You're in charge of squad.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.770
We'll extract
from the rooftop hatch.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.780
Tony, get the ropes.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.440
- Who's going in?
- I was thinking Herrmann.

26:25.450 --> 26:27.310
He's the smallest.

26:27.310 --> 26:29.430
Hey, guys,

26:29.430 --> 26:31.550
there's a broken cable coiled up
on top of the elevator roof.

26:31.550 --> 26:34.020
It's got to weigh 700 pounds.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.920
It's blocking the entire hatch.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.160
We're gonna have
to find another way in.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.770
If we can't get in
from the top,

26:47.770 --> 26:49.070
we have to go in
from the side.

26:49.070 --> 26:52.540
Okay, how do
 we do that?

26:54.440 --> 26:55.810
We take off
the side panel.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.280
We make a bridge,
use a couple planks.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.280
We use a rescue car.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.650
Pike pole for a handrail.

26:59.650 --> 27:01.150
Walk the family across.

27:01.150 --> 27:03.480
300 feet up?

27:03.480 --> 27:04.620
It's what we got.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.420
Okay, get the rescue car.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.390
Let's go.

27:10.290 --> 27:13.360
Candidate,
 you're coming too.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.960

<i>[over speaker] What's going on?</i>

27:19.700 --> 27:23.340
Just hold steady.
We're coming for you.

27:23.340 --> 27:26.440
Otis, let them down
nice and slow.

Now, Chief.

- I am.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.420

28:43.420 --> 28:46.150
Yeah, Chief,

Okay, hold on,

 breathe.

29:17.580 --> 29:21.190
Okay, there you go.
Right on there.

29:21.190 --> 29:22.420
Good job.
All right.

29:22.420 --> 29:25.160
Here's some juice.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.390
Okay, I'm gonna get you guys
out of here...

29:28.400 --> 29:31.200
- It'll be okay.
- But I'm gonna need your help.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.530
Come with me.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.300
Stand here.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.300

29:36.300 --> 29:39.200
- All right, hold on to this.
- Okay.

29:39.210 --> 29:42.370
Ma'am, we're gonna
get you across first.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.210
One of us will
take your daughter.

29:44.210 --> 29:46.450
Last man out will have
to walk across with no rail.

29:46.450 --> 29:50.580
- [girl coughs]
- I'll go last.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.150
Okay.

29:52.150 --> 29:53.520
All right.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.590
All right, use the rail.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.330
Baby, it's okay.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.690
Just hold on to the rail.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.570
There you go.
You can do it.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.780
That's it.
You're doing great.

Hey, hey, hey,
just look at me right here.

Okay, you sure?

30:38.730 --> 30:41.170
Go, I'll be fine.

Okay, you ready?

Can you breathe,
 sweetie?

31:39.330 --> 31:42.260
You feeling better?
Yeah?

31:42.260 --> 31:44.860
[girl coughing]

31:44.870 --> 31:45.860
Nice work, Lieutenant.

31:45.870 --> 31:49.200
That was intense.

31:49.200 --> 31:53.810
That's you in a couple years
if you keep working hard.

32:01.680 --> 32:02.710
That's him.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.950
Blue shorts, black shirt.

32:06.890 --> 32:10.620
Hey, what do you want
with this guy anyway?

32:10.620 --> 32:14.390
He knew
 a patient of mine.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.260
Right.

32:16.260 --> 32:19.230
Okay.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.630
Hey.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.800
It's good to see you again,
by the way.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.540
Yeah, you, too.

[ball misses target]
[bouncing on ground]

32:38.550 --> 32:40.390
- Hi, Damon, right?
- Yeah.

32:40.390 --> 32:41.650
Can I talk to you
for a second?

32:41.650 --> 32:43.620
Sweetheart, you can
talk to me all day.

32:43.620 --> 32:44.820
Great. [clears throat]

32:50.030 --> 32:51.630
I knew Alicia Morales.

32:51.630 --> 32:54.570
I'm the paramedic
who tried to save her life.

32:54.570 --> 32:57.500
I was the last person
she talked to.

32:57.500 --> 33:01.440
I was also the first person
in the world to hold your son.

33:03.580 --> 33:08.480
He's beautiful, you know?
He's healthy.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.520
He's lived his whole life
so far in that hospital,

33:10.520 --> 33:15.050
but he's still so happy.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.490
He doesn't even
 have a name.

33:17.490 --> 33:19.060
Did you know that?

33:19.060 --> 33:23.300
Alicia wasn't alive
long enough to give him one.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.600
That's it.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.070
Just wanted you
 to know that.

33:32.070 --> 33:33.670
All right.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.580
Okay, [claps hands] 
back to the game. Let's go.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.620
Danny, what are
you doing here?

33:45.620 --> 33:46.850
Looking for you.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.350
District Manager
 called me.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.390
You didn't sign
your transfer papers.

33:51.390 --> 33:54.490
You know how many hoops I had to
jump through to get you into 67?

33:54.490 --> 33:56.430
- Yeah, about that.
- Forget it.

33:56.430 --> 33:58.160
This is how we're
gonna handle it.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.900
We go talk to Boden,
real cool, no big deal.

33:59.900 --> 34:03.100
Danny, I'm not
changing houses.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.440
I'm gonna stick it out here.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.370
So, what, just because
51 is gonna get

34:06.370 --> 34:08.110
out of this whole IED mess,
now you want to stick around?

34:08.110 --> 34:09.639
It's got nothing
to do with that.

34:09.639 --> 34:10.980
I like how they
do things here.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.409
My gut is telling me
that this is where I belong.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.449
[laughs] Your gut? You've been
on the job five minutes.

34:15.449 --> 34:16.510
You've got your house.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.100
- Let me have mine.
- You know what,

34:18.100 --> 34:19.679
this is your problem right
there, man. I'm telling you.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.620
You can never see what's
right in front of your face.

34:21.620 --> 34:23.050
- Oh, come on.
- Nah, whatever.

34:23.060 --> 34:25.090
You got it
 all figured out.

34:25.090 --> 34:27.489
[slams locker]

34:31.370 --> 34:32.659
Tell me
 I'm not crazy.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.929
You're not.
It all adds up.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.100
I don't care if this guy's
a rich real estate developer

34:38.110 --> 34:39.840
or some psycho
 with a lighter.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.639
He is a serial arsonist.

34:41.639 --> 34:43.980
We don't stop him,
more people are gonna die.

34:43.980 --> 34:47.150
Duffy wouldn't call
him into CPD.

34:47.150 --> 34:50.449
He says we don't
have enough proof.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.650
I don't know
what to do, Chief.

34:54.650 --> 34:58.060
We can't just let this ride.

34:58.060 --> 35:00.160
Connie!

35:02.060 --> 35:05.160
Get me that reporter
from the "Sun Times."

35:14.240 --> 35:18.580
There's something
I thought you should see.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.850
Your favorite patient
has a visitor.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.620
[baby fussing]

35:38.130 --> 35:40.430
Thanks.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.810
You did that.

35:49.810 --> 35:53.810
[fussing continues]

35:59.220 --> 36:01.220
[music playing in background]

36:01.220 --> 36:03.860
- Chief.
- Hey.

36:03.860 --> 36:06.220
I just want to apologize.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.060
The whole
 baby thing...

36:08.060 --> 36:11.700
I didn't exactly...

36:11.700 --> 36:14.030
Sorry, the point is,
it's done.

36:14.030 --> 36:15.670
What happened?

36:15.670 --> 36:19.070
The dad showed up
out of nowhere, so...

36:19.070 --> 36:20.540
- Glad to hear it.
- And the baby

36:20.540 --> 36:21.810
has a name now too.

36:21.810 --> 36:23.480
It's Alex.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.140

Yes, sir.

On my way.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.270
It's hard for me, man.

Club soda.

Yeah, see how
long that lasts.

Yeah, very lucky, but I'm

You think that
would've mattered?

 the account.
