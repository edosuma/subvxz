01:16.050 --> 01:19.417
All her life she had wanted
to teach at Wellesley College.

01:19.587 --> 01:22.613
So when a position opened
in the Art History department...

01:22.790 --> 01:26.521
...she pursued it single-mindedly
until she was hired.

01:32.233 --> 01:34.463
It was whispered
that Katherine Watson...

01:34.902 --> 01:37.166
...a first-year teacher
from Oakland State...

01:37.338 --> 01:40.569
...made up in brains
what she lacked in pedigree.

01:51.019 --> 01:53.681
Which was why this bohemian
from California...

01:53.855 --> 01:58.189
...was on her way to the most
conservative college in the nation.

01:58.359 --> 02:00.953
- Excuse me, please.
- Oh, sorry.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.325
Excuse me.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.667
Excuse me. The bus?

02:10.838 --> 02:12.533
- Keep walking, ma'am.
- Thank you.

02:12.707 --> 02:16.473
But Katherine Watson didn't come
to Wellesley to fit in.

02:17.011 --> 02:21.072
She came to Wellesley because
she wanted to make a difference.

02:21.249 --> 02:24.878
- Violet.
- My favorite Italian professor.

02:25.053 --> 02:27.021
- Nice summer?
- Terrific, thanks.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.349
- Who's that over there?
- Where?

02:29.524 --> 02:34.188
Oh, Katherine Watson. New teacher.
Art History. I'm dying to meet her.

03:35.623 --> 03:38.490
Who knocks at the Door of Learning?

03:38.659 --> 03:43.221
- I am every woman.
- What do you seek?

03:43.397 --> 03:45.991
To awaken my spirit
through hard work...

03:46.167 --> 03:48.431
...and dedicate my life
to knowledge.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.036
Then you are welcome.

03:50.204 --> 03:55.301
All women who seek to follow you
can enter here.

03:55.476 --> 04:00.209
I now declare
the academic year begun.

04:19.433 --> 04:23.961
A shame you didn't come yesterday.
It's so quiet before the girls arrive.

04:26.674 --> 04:30.041
Just a few rules.
No holes in the walls.

04:30.211 --> 04:34.841
No pets, no loud noises, no radio
or hi-fi after 8 on weekdays...

04:35.016 --> 04:36.711
...10 on weekends...

04:36.884 --> 04:40.342
...no hot plates and no male visitors.

04:42.757 --> 04:44.315
Anything wrong?

04:45.226 --> 04:48.787
I don't think I can go a year
without a hot plate.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.892
Don't you just love chintz?

04:56.070 --> 04:57.935
And look.

05:01.976 --> 05:03.773
They match.

05:03.945 --> 05:07.881
Sweet, right? Your room's here.

05:08.049 --> 05:12.076
My room is just across the way...

05:12.653 --> 05:15.349
...and Amanda Armstrong's
down the other end.

05:15.990 --> 05:18.652
- You grew up here?
- My whole life.

05:18.826 --> 05:22.660
You'll meet my parents
when they come to visit.

05:22.830 --> 05:26.129
- They visit?
- Regularly.

05:28.636 --> 05:34.302
- What do you teach?
- Speech, elocution and poise.

05:34.742 --> 05:37.176
Dinners are communal,
so I'll handle that.

05:37.345 --> 05:40.940
But breakfast and lunch,
you're on your own. So...

05:41.115 --> 05:46.178
...we each get our own shelf.
I'll make your label this evening.

05:46.621 --> 05:52.560
I don't need to tell you, everything on
our individual shelves is sacrosanct.

05:54.395 --> 05:58.058
I just knew when we met...

05:58.966 --> 06:01.366
...we'd be instant friends.

06:19.520 --> 06:24.082
Be careful. They can smell fear.

06:44.412 --> 06:47.245
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.242
Thank you.

06:49.984 --> 06:54.853
This is History of Art 100.

06:55.423 --> 06:59.450
We'll be following
Dr. Staunton's syllabus.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.596
- Any questions so far?
- Your name?

07:03.597 --> 07:05.963
- Why don't you go first?
- Connie Baker.

07:06.133 --> 07:10.797
- Katherine Watson. Nice to meet you.
- Dr. Watson, I presume.

07:11.906 --> 07:15.137
- Not yet. And you are?
- Giselle Levy.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.869
Giselle. If someone could get the...

07:19.146 --> 07:23.082
- Susan Delacorte.
- Thank you, Susan Delacorte.

07:26.587 --> 07:31.524
From the beginning, man has always
had the impulse to create art.

07:31.692 --> 07:35.128
- Can anyone tell me what this is?
- Wounded Bison, Altamira, Spain...

07:35.296 --> 07:38.561
...about 15,000 B.C.
Joan Brandwyn.

07:39.033 --> 07:40.933
Very good, Joan.

07:41.302 --> 07:45.295
Despite the age of these, they are
technically sophisticated because...

07:45.473 --> 07:49.967
The shading and the thickness of the
lines moving over the bison's hump.

07:50.144 --> 07:54.080
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's exactly right.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.840
Next slide.

07:57.385 --> 08:01.446
This is probably less familiar.
It was discovered by archeologists...

08:01.622 --> 08:05.581
In 1879, Lascaux, France.
Dates back to 10,000 B.C.

08:05.760 --> 08:10.060
Singled out because of flowing lines
depicting the movement of the animal.

08:12.199 --> 08:14.929
- Impressive. Name?
- Herd of Horses.

08:15.102 --> 08:18.299
- I meant yours.
- We call her Flicka.

08:18.939 --> 08:21.703
Elizabeth Warren.
They call me Betty.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.468
Very good.

08:23.644 --> 08:26.306
Betty is also correct.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.382
Just because something is ancient
doesn't mean that it is primitive.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.780
For example. Next slide, please.

08:32.953 --> 08:35.443
Mycerinus and His Queen. 2470 B.C.

08:35.623 --> 08:38.114
It's a funerary statue
of the pharaoh and queen...

08:38.292 --> 08:42.592
...originally intended to preserve
the pharaoh's ka. Soul.

08:46.167 --> 08:49.102
Have any of you taken
Art History before?

08:49.270 --> 08:51.500
No.

08:54.241 --> 08:56.835
Let's go on. Slide.

08:57.211 --> 09:00.112
Seated Scribe. Egypt. 2400 B.C.

09:01.048 --> 09:04.677
Peasant Couple Plowing.
Sixteenth century B.C. Egypt.

09:05.319 --> 09:08.413
Snake Goddess.
Minoan. 1600 B.C.

09:09.190 --> 09:11.124
Fresco. Minoan. 1600 B.C.

09:12.026 --> 09:14.187
Funeral Mask. Mycenaean. 1200.

09:26.574 --> 09:27.939
Could someone please get...?

09:34.748 --> 09:36.409
Thank you.

09:37.952 --> 09:41.353
By a show of hands only...

09:42.189 --> 09:46.353
...how many of you have read
the entire text?

09:48.829 --> 09:54.199
- And the suggested supplements.
- Long way from Oakland State?

09:57.638 --> 10:00.072
Well, you girls do prepare.

10:00.241 --> 10:04.007
If you've nothing else for us,
we could go to independent study.

10:04.912 --> 10:06.539
Ac...

10:43.284 --> 10:49.416
I was in California once. How do you
get work done with all that sunshine?

10:49.757 --> 10:53.386
- We tan in class.
- Really?

10:53.661 --> 10:54.958
No.

10:59.266 --> 11:01.860
You know, not everybody
wanted you.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.527
I'm not naming any names.

11:04.705 --> 11:09.301
These jobs usually go quickly.
Ex-students, friends of, you know...

11:09.476 --> 11:11.808
...the right people.

11:11.979 --> 11:15.915
The person they wanted took a job at
Brown, and no one else was available.

11:16.083 --> 11:18.176
So here you are.

11:19.019 --> 11:22.819
You can go in now. Good luck.

11:28.829 --> 11:31.627
Your first class left a lot
to be desired, Miss Watson.

11:31.799 --> 11:35.462
And I'm curious about the subject
of your dissertation.

11:35.636 --> 11:40.573
You suggest, "Picasso will do
for the 20th century...

11:40.741 --> 11:44.700
...what Michelangelo did
for the Renaissance," unquote.

11:45.446 --> 11:47.914
In terms of influencing movements.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.279
So these canvases that
they're turning out these days...

11:51.452 --> 11:54.512
...with paint dripped
and splotched on them...

11:54.688 --> 11:59.648
...they're as worthy of our attention
as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel?

12:00.194 --> 12:01.991
I'm not comparing them.

12:02.162 --> 12:05.791
Have you ever seen
the Sistine Chapel, Miss Watson?

12:05.966 --> 12:07.957
Actually stood there?

12:09.603 --> 12:11.468
I've never been to Europe.

12:14.742 --> 12:19.543
I can assure all of you this is the place
I want to be more than anything.

12:19.713 --> 12:24.207
Better discipline next class,
Miss Watson.

12:29.556 --> 12:31.786
- Hello.
- It's me.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.989
- Hey!
- Collect from Katherine Watson.

12:35.162 --> 12:38.723
- Will you accept?
- Yeah, sure, of course I will.

12:39.366 --> 12:41.561
Hey, is everything okay?

12:42.836 --> 12:43.825
Yeah.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.731
Tough, huh?

12:49.843 --> 12:52.334
Well, how are the classes?

12:52.980 --> 12:54.914
Snobs, right?

12:56.216 --> 13:00.312
- I hate to say I told you so.
- You don't have to.

13:06.860 --> 13:08.987
I can't really talk right now.

13:10.197 --> 13:12.131
I'll write you tonight.

13:16.270 --> 13:17.760
So you got a fella?

13:19.239 --> 13:22.470
He's... He's there. I'm here.

13:22.643 --> 13:28.104
Long distance. Torture. I know.
Come. Come in and sit down.

13:31.785 --> 13:35.949
When Lenny left for the South Pacific,
it nearly broke my heart.

13:36.123 --> 13:38.853
We wrote every day until...

13:41.528 --> 13:43.621
He was a great man.

13:44.431 --> 13:47.366
- I'm sorry.
- It was a hundred years ago.

13:47.534 --> 13:49.331
I'm babbling.

13:51.572 --> 13:56.600
I love Lucy.
Even if she is a communist.

13:56.777 --> 13:59.644
The only thing red about Lucy
is her hair.

13:59.813 --> 14:02.281
And even that's fake. Desi said it.

14:02.449 --> 14:04.383
Winchell wrote it.

14:05.152 --> 14:08.087
Amanda Armstrong.
I see you survived.

14:08.255 --> 14:10.120
Katherine Watson. Just barely.

14:10.290 --> 14:13.418
Oh, good. You've met.
Katherine's taken the third bedroom.

14:13.594 --> 14:16.586
How about a little dinner
before What's My Line?

14:17.631 --> 14:20.156
How about a little drink?

14:22.536 --> 14:25.369
Her companion died in May.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.237
Companion?

14:28.075 --> 14:30.441
You know, companion.

14:31.578 --> 14:37.574
Josephine Burns.
Taught biology here for 30 years.

14:40.954 --> 14:44.082
You'll love it here, Katherine.
You'll see.

14:44.258 --> 14:49.195
I already do. I... Honestly,
it's beautiful. It's perfect, really.

14:49.363 --> 14:53.925
Well, don't fool yourself. They have
claws underneath their white gloves.

14:55.235 --> 14:56.702
Who?

14:57.504 --> 15:02.032
The alumnae, their offspring,
the faculty. You name it.

15:02.409 --> 15:04.206
Watch out for yourself.

15:04.378 --> 15:06.437
Too much independence
frightens them.

15:06.613 --> 15:10.379
- Will you please stop?
- Oh, a word of advice.

15:10.551 --> 15:13.952
Don't let those girls
know that they got to you.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.517
- They didn't.
- Good for you.

15:20.994 --> 15:23.258
You almost convinced me.

15:53.594 --> 15:56.529
- What is that?
- You tell me.

15:59.967 --> 16:03.801
Carcass by Soutine. 1925.

16:04.738 --> 16:08.230
- It's not on the syllabus.
- No, it's not.

16:10.244 --> 16:12.508
Is it any good?

16:17.751 --> 16:22.381
Come on, ladies.
There's no wrong answer.

16:22.556 --> 16:26.048
There's also no textbook
telling you what to think.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.119
It's not that easy, is it?

16:30.230 --> 16:32.562
All right. No. It's not good.

16:32.733 --> 16:35.531
In fact, I wouldn't even call it art.
It's grotesque.

16:35.736 --> 16:37.601
Is there a rule against
grotesque art?

16:37.804 --> 16:41.262
I think there's something
aggressive about it...

16:42.009 --> 16:45.172
...and erotic.
- To you, everything is erotic.

16:45.345 --> 16:47.745
- Everything is erotic.
- Girls.

16:47.915 --> 16:50.145
- Aren't there standards?
- Of course.

16:50.317 --> 16:53.684
Otherwise a tacky velvet painting
could be equated to a Rembrandt.

16:53.854 --> 16:58.052
My Uncle Ferdie has two tacky velvet
paintings. He loves those clowns.

16:58.225 --> 17:03.959
There are standards, technique,
composition, color, even subject.

17:04.131 --> 17:07.123
So if you're suggesting
that rotted side of meat is art...

17:07.300 --> 17:10.464
...much less good art,
then what are we going to learn?

17:11.637 --> 17:13.195
Just that.

17:13.373 --> 17:16.934
You have outlined our new syllabus,
Betty. Thank you.

17:17.109 --> 17:20.011
What is art?
What makes it good or bad?

17:20.180 --> 17:22.147
And who decides?

17:23.116 --> 17:24.583
Next slide, please.

17:26.619 --> 17:29.680
Twenty-five years ago someone
thought this was brilliant.

17:29.856 --> 17:32.120
- I can see that.
- Who?

17:32.292 --> 17:35.819
My mother. I painted it
for her birthday.

17:35.996 --> 17:40.194
Next slide. This is my mom.

17:40.801 --> 17:44.100
- Is it art?
- It's a snapshot.

17:44.271 --> 17:48.207
If I told you Ansel Adams had taken it,
would that make a difference?

17:49.276 --> 17:53.679
- Art isn't art until someone says it is.
- It's art!

17:54.948 --> 17:57.678
- The right people.
- Who are they?

17:57.884 --> 17:59.249
Betty Warren!

17:59.419 --> 18:02.980
- We're lucky we have one right here.
- Screw you.

18:04.791 --> 18:07.157
Could you go back
to the Soutine, please?

18:09.496 --> 18:13.523
Just look at it again.
Look beyond the paint.

18:13.700 --> 18:18.569
Let us try to open our minds
to a new idea.

18:21.508 --> 18:25.569
All right, back to chapter three.
Has anyone read it?

18:27.848 --> 18:28.872
Okay.

18:32.285 --> 18:35.220
"When your courses are set,
and a dream boat you've met...

18:35.389 --> 18:37.414
...have a real cigarette.
Have a Camel."

18:37.591 --> 18:41.618
I've got my courses, I've got my Camel
cigarette. Where is my dream boat?

18:41.795 --> 18:45.322
- Giselle, where is my dream boat?
- Betty's cousin isn't good enough?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.524
- I haven't met him.
- Don't encourage her.

18:47.701 --> 18:50.261
He's only escorting
Connie as a favor.

18:50.437 --> 18:52.371
Why are you like this?

18:53.040 --> 18:55.133
I didn't mean that.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.970
I'm just under so much pressure
with the wedding.

18:58.145 --> 19:01.114
Do you realize November 2
is three weeks from now?

19:01.281 --> 19:03.215
- Oh, honey.
- Don't have it.

19:03.383 --> 19:05.010
- Don't come.
- Here. Here.

19:05.185 --> 19:08.382
I'm working on table seating now,
so I can just erase your name.

19:08.555 --> 19:09.817
- Can I see it?
- No.

19:09.990 --> 19:12.015
Let me look.
I can't look for a second?

19:12.192 --> 19:15.593
- You want to see where Bill is sitting.
- No. That is over. Right?

19:15.762 --> 19:18.424
Right? Giselle, right?

19:20.434 --> 19:21.958
Damn it.

19:28.008 --> 19:31.466
- Do I look a little bit like her?
- Like who?

19:31.978 --> 19:35.436
- Katherine Watson.
- You mean, "crap is art"?

19:36.183 --> 19:40.449
- I think she's fabulous.
- Well, no man wanted her.

19:41.855 --> 19:44.016
- She isn't dead.
- She's at least 30.

19:44.191 --> 19:47.251
- Oh, no. No.
- I guess she never wanted children.

19:47.427 --> 19:49.361
For your information...

19:49.529 --> 19:55.559
...Katherine Watson had to take
this job to escape from California.

19:56.269 --> 19:57.531
Please.

19:57.704 --> 20:01.606
She had a torrid affair
with a Hollywood movie star.

20:01.775 --> 20:06.109
- She came here to get away.
- That's ridiculous.

20:06.279 --> 20:09.009
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

20:09.483 --> 20:12.077
Who was it, Giselle?
Don't be a pimple! Tell me!

20:12.252 --> 20:14.948
- It's ridiculous.
- Tell me. No, it's not. You know.

20:15.122 --> 20:18.751
- You know something. Tell me.
- It's William Holden.

20:20.227 --> 20:21.956
- Fantastic!
- I know.

20:22.129 --> 20:23.756
Who is it?

20:24.664 --> 20:27.132
William Holden.

20:35.675 --> 20:39.839
I know. I know. I'm late. I'm... Abject
pleading, apologies, forgiveness.

20:40.147 --> 20:41.671
Is she giving you any trouble?

20:41.848 --> 20:45.545
If these girls can't get back on time,
know what I say? Lock them out.

20:46.286 --> 20:51.246
Come on. Out! I'm going
to lock the door. Out!

20:51.525 --> 20:56.827
Bedtime, ladies. Bedtime.
Let's go. Bedtime.

20:57.397 --> 20:59.524
- Hey, Betty.
- Quiet time, ladies.

20:59.699 --> 21:02.133
Women like Katherine Watson
don't get married...

21:02.302 --> 21:05.328
...because they choose not to.
- No woman chooses to live...

21:05.505 --> 21:08.941
...without a home, unless she's
sleeping with her Italian professor.

21:09.109 --> 21:11.270
- You are so critical.
- I am not.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.935
Of course you are.
You're your mother's daughter.

21:14.114 --> 21:15.877
It's a classic Electra complex.

21:16.850 --> 21:18.647
I don't blame you. I mean...

21:18.819 --> 21:20.980
...who wouldn't want
to murder your mother?

21:21.154 --> 21:24.351
- Hey. How's the Harvard sweetheart?
- Divine.

21:24.524 --> 21:26.617
Got an extra ciggie?

21:26.793 --> 21:28.624
- Did you do his homework?
- Of course.

21:28.795 --> 21:31.764
- Want to do mine?
- No.

21:34.367 --> 21:38.827
This isn't what I think it is. Is it?

21:41.141 --> 21:42.403
Where'd you get it?

21:44.911 --> 21:46.640
From the school nurse.

21:47.480 --> 21:52.213
- It's against the law.
- Oh, honey. It's a girl's best friend.

21:52.385 --> 21:56.879
- A certain kind of girl.
- Meet the last virgin bride.

21:58.225 --> 22:02.286
- Spencer is a gentleman.
- And even gentlemen have dicks.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.525
- Maybe I'll get one.
- What? A dick?

22:09.703 --> 22:11.933
Don't be stupid, Connie.

22:14.808 --> 22:17.800
Someone, somewhere,
someday might be interested.

22:19.079 --> 22:23.106
Just in case.
Just in case, I'll be prepared.

22:26.586 --> 22:28.577
Was that necessary?

22:28.755 --> 22:31.019
I was taught it's best
to speak honestly.

22:31.191 --> 22:34.058
Okay. You're a bitch.

22:41.101 --> 22:43.763
We recently learned
that Amanda Armstrong...

22:43.937 --> 22:48.897
...our nurse, has been distributing
contraception to Wellesley girls.

22:49.075 --> 22:51.839
This revelation is disturbing
to an institution...

22:52.012 --> 22:54.640
...that prides itself on propriety.

23:05.525 --> 23:10.690
Go, go, go! Go, go!
It's been going on since the late '80s.

23:10.864 --> 23:14.595
- Whoever wins is first to marry!
- Do the girls take it literally?

23:14.768 --> 23:19.603
Only the girl with the winning hoop.
Oh, look, it's Phyllis Nayor!

23:22.075 --> 23:26.671
Good for her. It gets me every time.

23:26.846 --> 23:29.440
- Why the buggies?
- They've got their man.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.107
They're wishing for their babies.

23:36.122 --> 23:38.249
Have you seen this?

23:39.392 --> 23:40.825
What is it?

23:41.594 --> 23:46.224
It's a front-page attack on Amanda
Armstrong. Betty Warren wrote it.

23:52.906 --> 23:55.875
"By providing contraception
on demand, our school nurse...

23:56.042 --> 23:59.102
...is little more than a cheerleader
for promiscuity." Wow.

23:59.279 --> 24:02.578
Oh, they're not going to dump her
in a lake!

24:04.784 --> 24:06.979
- I'm coming, Phyllis!
- Have you seen this?

24:07.153 --> 24:10.350
I wouldn't worry. Betty's just
a young girl flexing her muscles.

24:10.523 --> 24:13.321
So was Lizzie Borden,
and her mother wasn't president...

24:13.493 --> 24:17.259
...of the alumnae association.
- Would somebody get that girl a towel!

24:17.430 --> 24:20.524
- That's her mother?
- Apple, tree.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.861
Is Amanda going to get into trouble?

24:23.036 --> 24:25.903
Amanda needs to start
minding her p's and q's.

24:26.072 --> 24:29.007
The trick to surviving Wellesley
is never getting noticed.

24:29.175 --> 24:31.234
Ciao, Mona Lisa.

24:31.945 --> 24:34.345
The big war hero.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.982
He thinks he's something special.

24:38.184 --> 24:40.914
He sleeps with his students.

24:43.223 --> 24:45.589
The gold is fine.
The napkin rings are vulgar.

24:45.759 --> 24:48.057
The glassware should be trimmed
with gold.

24:48.228 --> 24:52.688
The little sugar boxes, gold and white,
filled with chocolate. No candlesticks.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.733
- Freesia instead of daisies.
- Wise choice, madam.

24:57.070 --> 24:58.503
No baby's breath.

25:03.777 --> 25:07.110
- You already had your fitting?
- We're on our way.

25:07.280 --> 25:10.841
Here's the seating chart
and Spencer's list of groomsmen.

25:11.017 --> 25:13.076
Oh, I almost forgot.

25:13.453 --> 25:17.787
I spoke to him about reading the
poem. He'd rather not. I said all right.

25:19.426 --> 25:21.894
Excuse us for a second, Joan.

25:27.233 --> 25:30.566
A good wife lets her husband
think that everything's his idea...

25:30.737 --> 25:33.399
...even when it's not.
- I don't care if he reads it.

25:33.573 --> 25:35.632
You will in retrospect.

25:36.943 --> 25:42.347
Now, why don't you see if you
can't nudge the idea into his head.

25:47.620 --> 25:51.488
I've been here now
for 21 years, Jocelyn.

25:51.658 --> 25:54.786
- I remember you as a student.
- Twenty-four, if you count that.

25:54.961 --> 25:56.986
So why the theatrics?

25:57.430 --> 26:01.594
We cannot appear
to promote sexual promiscuity.

26:01.768 --> 26:05.135
Okay. It's about appearances, then?
No.

26:05.305 --> 26:07.569
All right, all right.

26:07.740 --> 26:12.609
All right. Well, I promise not to appear
to be sympathetic, progressive...

26:12.779 --> 26:16.408
...or what did Mrs. Warren
call it? "Liberal."

26:16.983 --> 26:18.848
Scout's honor.

26:20.286 --> 26:23.722
I spent the better part of Friday
afternoon convincing the alumnae...

26:23.890 --> 26:25.790
...that your record was impeccable...

26:25.959 --> 26:30.191
...that you would no longer
provide contraceptive devices...

26:30.363 --> 26:33.025
...and you'd make
a public statement to that effect.

26:33.199 --> 26:35.326
I'm not willing to make
a public statement.

26:35.502 --> 26:37.834
It doesn't matter, Amanda.

26:40.306 --> 26:42.365
They're letting you go.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.840
It's out of my hands.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.449
And this champagne cup
is in the wrong place.

26:53.620 --> 26:57.283
And up and down. And up and...

26:57.457 --> 26:59.982
Katherine. Good evening,
Miss Watson.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.492
- Good evening, Miss Watson.
- Join us.

27:06.432 --> 27:07.763
No.

27:07.934 --> 27:10.459
- Good night, Miss Watson.
- Good night, Miss Watson.

27:10.637 --> 27:12.867
And down. Very nice. Very nice.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.322
Hey.

27:32.125 --> 27:35.526
Heard about Amanda. I'm sorry.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.755
She seemed all right about it.
I wouldn't be.

27:38.932 --> 27:41.366
They don't give you
too many chances around here.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.435
Oh, that depends how much
they hate you to begin with.

27:46.406 --> 27:48.897
Can I buy you a drink?
Or are you here for dinner?

27:49.075 --> 27:51.475
How long do
the marriage lectures take?

27:51.644 --> 27:53.805
Get this woman a booth.

28:08.494 --> 28:11.725
Your husband is at a crossroads
in his career.

28:12.599 --> 28:18.936
He's competing for promotion
against two rivals, Smith and Jones.

28:19.973 --> 28:24.603
To get the edge, you have wisely
decided to invite the boss...

28:24.777 --> 28:27.803
...and his wife to a 7:00 dinner.

28:27.981 --> 28:30.711
You've carefully planned
your meal...

28:30.883 --> 28:34.182
...set your table
and arranged for a babysitter.

28:34.354 --> 28:37.323
- Oh, we have babies!
- Yes, and I have twins!

28:39.359 --> 28:42.123
Then, surprise. It's 6:15...

28:42.295 --> 28:46.823
...and your husband's called to say
that Smith, Jones and their wives...

28:47.000 --> 28:49.628
...have been invited
at the boss's request.

28:54.340 --> 28:55.898
Ever the Wellesley girl...

28:56.075 --> 28:58.600
...you keep your cool
and understand...

28:58.778 --> 29:03.238
...that the boss is probably testing you
as much as your husband. What next?

29:03.416 --> 29:06.476
- Yes?
- File for divorce?

29:08.888 --> 29:11.322
That's very funny.

29:11.491 --> 29:14.392
But the thing is, it's not a joke.

29:15.061 --> 29:17.621
A few years from now
your sole responsibility...

29:17.797 --> 29:21.324
...will be taking care
of your husband and children.

29:24.304 --> 29:27.239
You may all be here...

29:27.407 --> 29:29.466
...for an easy A...

29:29.642 --> 29:34.705
...but the grade that matters the most
is the one he gives you, not me.

29:35.448 --> 29:38.542
- You'll need to...
- Whatever you do...

29:38.718 --> 29:41.152
...don't put the boss's wife
next to your husband.

29:41.321 --> 29:45.052
- Why not?
- She's screwing him.

29:46.359 --> 29:49.795
Is that where you learned
to speak Italian? In Italy?

29:49.962 --> 29:51.429
Yeah.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.330
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yes.

29:59.639 --> 30:02.073
You know, if you were mine,
I'd never let you go.

30:02.241 --> 30:04.607
I wouldn't have asked
your permission.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.840
Yeah, they say you're progressive.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.146
A forward thinker.

30:12.051 --> 30:14.781
- Are you?
- There are a lot of labels here...

30:15.221 --> 30:16.688
...l've noticed.

30:16.856 --> 30:22.692
Right family, right school, right art,
right way of thinking.

30:23.162 --> 30:25.687
Well, saves the effort
on thinking for yourself.

30:26.866 --> 30:30.302
How do you expect to ever make
a difference if everything is a joke?

30:31.270 --> 30:35.400
Oh, Katherine Watson comes to
Wellesley to set us all free? Come on.

30:37.643 --> 30:41.909
- Thank you for the drink.
- No, no. Wait. I was teasing.

30:42.715 --> 30:45.149
They have their own way
of doing things here.

30:45.451 --> 30:49.785
You've just gotta find a way
to work with them. We all had to.

31:01.334 --> 31:03.199
I'm sorry.

31:05.271 --> 31:08.434
Five years ago,
they'd have slapped my wrist.

31:08.608 --> 31:12.738
But now there's a committee
for the protection of everything.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.411
They think you're dangerous?

31:16.582 --> 31:20.780
Oh, no, darling. No. Subversive.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.321
It's gotten to the point...

31:24.490 --> 31:27.891
...where you don't know
who is protecting whom from what.

31:28.561 --> 31:35.023
Or should that be "from whom"?
Well, whom gives a damn anyway?

31:35.568 --> 31:38.264
They're doing me a favor really.

31:40.573 --> 31:42.268
Will you be all right?

31:45.845 --> 31:47.779
Better than that.

31:51.951 --> 31:56.615
I should really have left
when Josephine died.

31:59.659 --> 32:02.992
Nothing left to love
here anymore. So...

32:17.477 --> 32:19.411
Hello?

32:20.646 --> 32:23.547
- Miss Watson?
- Yes. I'm back here.

32:25.151 --> 32:29.679
I've never been to this part
of campus before. Where are we?

32:30.523 --> 32:34.755
No man's land. So to speak.

32:37.563 --> 32:39.292
Come on in.

32:40.099 --> 32:41.726
What's all this?

32:42.435 --> 32:44.596
Different things different days.

32:44.770 --> 32:51.141
People who inspire me,
artists I admire, editorials I don't.

32:51.444 --> 32:54.743
So you came to see me.

32:55.615 --> 32:58.607
- You gave me a C.
- I'm kind.

32:58.985 --> 33:01.783
The assignment was to write
about Bruegel. I did that.

33:02.255 --> 33:05.782
- No, what you did was copy Strauss.
- I was referencing an expert.

33:06.325 --> 33:09.954
If I wanted to know what he thought,
I'd buy his book.

33:13.432 --> 33:16.128
Miss Watson, with all due respect...

33:17.937 --> 33:20.201
Bruegel was a storyteller.
Find the stories.

33:20.373 --> 33:24.434
Break them down into smaller pieces.
You might actually enjoy it.

33:25.411 --> 33:29.404
- You're giving me another chance?
- So it seems.

33:31.517 --> 33:34.543
Is that my file? What's it say?

33:36.622 --> 33:38.385
Well, let's see.

33:39.992 --> 33:43.086
- Straight A's.
- Until now.

33:44.363 --> 33:48.026
President of the poetry society,
captain of the debate team...

33:48.200 --> 33:51.897
...co-captain of the tennis club,
founder of the horticulture league.

33:52.071 --> 33:56.508
- I sound like a pompous ass.
- Yes, you do, but a very busy one.

33:56.676 --> 34:01.511
And it says here that you're pre-law.
What law school are you gonna go to?

34:01.681 --> 34:05.447
I hadn't thought about that.
After I graduate, I'm getting married.

34:05.618 --> 34:09.418
- And then?
- And then I'll be married.

34:10.222 --> 34:11.518
You can do both.

34:11.824 --> 34:16.625
Just for fun, if you could go
to any law school, which would it be?

34:17.396 --> 34:18.987
Yale.

34:19.699 --> 34:20.893
Yale.

34:21.067 --> 34:25.969
They keep five slots open for women,
one unofficially for a Wellesley girl.

34:26.138 --> 34:28.971
But you haven't really
thought about it.

34:46.559 --> 34:50.962
Wake up, Joanie, wake up.
Wake up.

34:51.897 --> 34:53.228
Okay, don't get up.

34:53.399 --> 34:56.300
Don't hear what I have to say
about Tommy and Spencer...

34:56.469 --> 34:59.734
...looking at an engagement ring...

34:59.905 --> 35:01.338
...for you.

35:03.075 --> 35:04.565
You're sure?

35:04.744 --> 35:06.974
That's everything
we always wanted, huh?

35:07.146 --> 35:10.604
We'll be best friends, and our
husbands will be best friends...

35:10.783 --> 35:14.150
...and we'll have houses together
and we'll have babies together...

35:14.320 --> 35:16.413
...and they'll be best friends.

35:16.589 --> 35:19.615
You're going to be
Mrs. Tommy Donegal.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.084
When?

35:21.260 --> 35:25.560
I'll get the scoop tomorrow.
You go back to sleep.

35:26.565 --> 35:30.524
The first part of the exam
will consist of two pairs of slides.

35:30.703 --> 35:34.799
Please identify each of the slides
by name, period and date.

35:34.974 --> 35:36.942
Then compare and contrast them.

35:37.109 --> 35:39.475
You will have 10 minutes
for each pair.

35:39.645 --> 35:42.011
Then you will write
a 1500-word essay...

35:42.181 --> 35:46.515
...describing the stylistic differences
between Raphael and van Eyck.

35:47.086 --> 35:49.350
Eyes forward, Miss Delacorte.

35:50.122 --> 35:52.249
You have 40 minutes.

35:52.425 --> 35:53.915
Good luck.

36:10.776 --> 36:13.142
- Excuse me.
- Governor. Another shot, please.

36:15.848 --> 36:18.214
This way, please. Thank you.

36:37.670 --> 36:39.035
Excuse me.

36:45.644 --> 36:48.044
This is quite the event.

36:48.214 --> 36:52.150
- I'm surprised I was invited.
- Well, look around you.

36:52.318 --> 36:53.945
Who wasn't?

36:58.624 --> 37:01.616
You ever hear the expression
"Keeping up with the Joneses"?

37:01.794 --> 37:03.022
Of course.

37:03.195 --> 37:04.958
Mr. And Mrs. Gordon Jones.

37:05.131 --> 37:09.363
The actual, historical family
they invented the phrase about.

37:11.804 --> 37:13.431
Good to know.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.592
That's him!

38:21.207 --> 38:24.301
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.

38:25.477 --> 38:28.207
- Thank you very much.
- A beautiful dress.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.746
Hi, we're so glad you came.

38:30.916 --> 38:33.578
- We're together. Table 19.
- Good.

38:35.354 --> 38:37.322
Holy God!

38:37.489 --> 38:41.186
The governor is right behind you.
Don't turn around.

38:44.363 --> 38:46.058
Great band.

38:49.001 --> 38:50.525
- Violet.
- Yes?

38:50.703 --> 38:52.864
- Would you mind if I go here?
- Not at all.

38:53.038 --> 38:54.733
Over here. Thank you.

38:57.443 --> 39:00.776
- Great band.
- Great band.

39:01.113 --> 39:03.581
- Hi, Katherine.
- Hi, Professor Dunbar.

39:06.919 --> 39:08.853
I'm getting a Manhattan.
Like anything?

39:09.021 --> 39:10.750
No, thank you.

39:10.923 --> 39:13.187
I'll take a Jack and ginger.

39:16.262 --> 39:18.423
He's making his move.

39:20.799 --> 39:23.267
I knew he'd go for her.

39:23.435 --> 39:25.835
She's too old for him.

39:26.005 --> 39:28.235
She's too smart for him.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.669
Hold that.

39:41.387 --> 39:43.446
- They're playing our song.
- What?

39:43.622 --> 39:46.887
- They're playing our song.
- I heard you.

39:47.059 --> 39:50.085
- Hi.
- Hi, Giselle.

39:52.731 --> 39:54.596
- Ladies' choice?
- Sure.

39:55.901 --> 39:57.493
Excuse me.

40:05.778 --> 40:09.373
Ladies, gentlemen! Quiet!

40:10.149 --> 40:12.640
What's this about the poem
you wanted me to read?

40:12.818 --> 40:15.810
- It was your idea, remember?
- I never said that.

40:15.988 --> 40:17.512
Ready?

40:19.325 --> 40:20.314
Excellent.

40:21.160 --> 40:25.597
Well, I wrote this down, just in case
you forgot. It's my favorite.

40:26.332 --> 40:27.890
Smile.

40:33.973 --> 40:38.672
Now, Betty, I tried to think of
a million ways to tell you how I feel.

40:38.844 --> 40:40.937
But instead...

40:41.714 --> 40:44.410
...I refer to your favorite poem.

40:54.193 --> 40:56.957
- Good catch.
- You said it.

40:59.198 --> 41:01.359
He's a morsel. Miss Watson!

41:01.533 --> 41:04.229
- He's a favor. Remember?
- Come on.

41:04.403 --> 41:07.395
Miss Watson,
I want you to meet Tommy.

41:07.573 --> 41:09.700
Tommy, come here for a second.

41:11.243 --> 41:13.837
You are so beautiful.

41:14.413 --> 41:18.179
- This is Katherine Watson.
- Oh, wow! In the flesh.

41:18.350 --> 41:22.047
- She has not shut up about you.
- Oh, stop.

41:22.221 --> 41:24.815
- You know what I'm saying?
- I do.

41:24.990 --> 41:28.721
- You did something to impress her.
- Well, it seems you did too.

41:31.530 --> 41:35.990
- You make these especially well.
- Thank you.

41:36.735 --> 41:39.568
I had a fella. Lenny.

41:40.639 --> 41:45.201
You remind me of him so much.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.475
He had this...

41:49.048 --> 41:52.108
...funny little thing
where his two front teeth...

41:52.284 --> 41:54.343
...they overlapped.

41:57.156 --> 41:58.783
He's dead.

42:01.660 --> 42:03.218
South Pacific.

42:23.248 --> 42:26.376
My parents say my future
is right on the horizon.

42:26.552 --> 42:28.918
Tell them the horizon
is an imaginary line...

42:29.088 --> 42:31.147
...that recedes as you approach it.

42:33.959 --> 42:36.519
I think I'll go back to my seat.

42:36.695 --> 42:39.721
I had a really nice time. Thank you.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.531
Connie.

42:43.502 --> 42:46.335
- Is this the brushoff?
- No.

42:46.505 --> 42:48.871
I thought you were, you know...

42:49.041 --> 42:51.009
...done with me.

42:52.444 --> 42:56.881
- Why would you think that?
- Betty said that you...

42:57.049 --> 43:02.453
I don't wanna take advantage.
I know that this was some favor.

43:02.621 --> 43:05.886
She did me the favor, not you.

43:06.825 --> 43:08.986
Come on, dance with me.

43:39.057 --> 43:41.355
She's too good for you.

43:42.961 --> 43:44.690
Maybe you're right.

43:46.265 --> 43:49.132
I'm too good for you too.

43:50.068 --> 43:55.131
- But I have lower expectations.
- I thought we settled this last spring.

43:55.507 --> 43:59.876
So then we probably shouldn't have
slept together over the summer.

44:00.212 --> 44:01.702
Stop.

44:05.184 --> 44:06.708
You ready?

44:07.119 --> 44:10.054
Do you wanna know something funny?

44:10.222 --> 44:12.782
Lenny's not dead.

44:13.258 --> 44:15.920
Not technically.

44:16.094 --> 44:17.391
He...

44:17.563 --> 44:19.053
He's got married.

44:19.231 --> 44:22.462
He's got a wife and kids...

44:23.035 --> 44:24.559
...and a mortgage.

44:24.736 --> 44:28.467
It was all supposed to be mine,
except for the wife.

44:30.409 --> 44:34.311
And you...
You don't look a thing like him.

44:34.479 --> 44:36.276
- You ugly bartender.
- Stop it.

44:36.448 --> 44:40.248
- You couldn't shine his shoes.
- I'm sorry.

44:40.419 --> 44:43.115
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.

44:43.288 --> 44:46.587
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.

44:47.626 --> 44:50.618
- Which way?
- Let me just see here.

44:50.796 --> 44:52.730
I'm not sure.

44:53.298 --> 44:56.563
- Where are we supposed to go?
- I think it's here.

44:56.735 --> 44:58.965
Come this way. We're almost there.

45:12.985 --> 45:14.316
Joe.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.320
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

45:17.489 --> 45:19.889
Great. Thank you so much for this.
You're a pal.

45:20.058 --> 45:22.117
It's a pleasure.
Your timing is perfect.

45:24.463 --> 45:26.328
There it is.

45:59.197 --> 46:02.428
- That's Jackson Pollock.
- In a word.

46:02.601 --> 46:07.038
I was getting used to the idea of dead,
maggoty meat being art, now this.

46:08.006 --> 46:11.032
Please don't tell me
we have to write a paper about it.

46:11.209 --> 46:12.642
Do me a favor.

46:12.811 --> 46:16.212
Do yourselves a favor.
Stop talking and look.

46:16.815 --> 46:21.843
You're not required to write a paper.
You're not even required to like it.

46:22.020 --> 46:24.284
You are required...

46:24.456 --> 46:26.151
...to consider it.

46:26.325 --> 46:31.024
That's your only assignment today.
When you're done, you may leave.

46:33.432 --> 46:36.128
Thank God Betty isn't here.

47:31.990 --> 47:34.049
Where did you come from?

47:34.226 --> 47:35.818
Mars.

47:37.095 --> 47:39.256
What a coincidence.

47:40.265 --> 47:46.226
Tom Donegal came by to see Joan.
So I hopped a ride.

47:46.605 --> 47:48.266
Why?

47:50.809 --> 47:52.902
So I could do this:

48:08.994 --> 48:11.224
- Katherine.
- Yes?

48:11.863 --> 48:13.831
- Have you got a minute?
- Of course.

48:13.999 --> 48:15.557
Walk with me.

48:16.334 --> 48:18.734
- You going home for the holidays?
- No.

48:18.904 --> 48:20.667
- Too far?
- Too expensive.

48:20.839 --> 48:23.364
But I've never had
a New England Christmas, so...

48:23.542 --> 48:27.273
- Our weather hasn't scared you away?
- I love it here.

48:27.446 --> 48:28.777
Do you?

48:29.147 --> 48:33.106
I've been getting some calls about
your teaching methods, Katherine.

48:33.285 --> 48:36.777
They're a little unorthodox...

48:36.955 --> 48:39.048
...for Wellesley.

48:39.224 --> 48:42.557
- We are traditionalists, Katherine.
- Yes, I noticed.

48:42.727 --> 48:45.252
So if you'd like to stay here...

48:45.430 --> 48:48.593
- Is that a question?
- More a discussion.

48:48.767 --> 48:53.136
- About my staying here?
- You'll have your formal review in May.

48:53.839 --> 48:55.807
Until then...

48:56.341 --> 48:59.606
...a little less modern art.

48:59.778 --> 49:01.678
Happy holidays.

49:01.847 --> 49:03.474
And to you.

49:09.621 --> 49:12.021
- Afternoon.
- Oh, hi...

49:16.828 --> 49:19.296
I hope you get that ring!

49:19.631 --> 49:23.260
Bye, girls, see you next year.
Have a safe trip.

49:31.376 --> 49:34.470
So, what's the big hush-hush secret?

49:34.646 --> 49:38.013
Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter
of little Spencers?

49:38.183 --> 49:40.413
Stop. They'll tell us
when they're ready.

49:40.585 --> 49:42.212
Are you ready?

49:42.387 --> 49:46.084
Is she the cutest? You are the cutest.
Come here, you.

49:50.996 --> 49:53.965
Spencer's been made junior partner.

49:54.833 --> 49:58.929
- It is about time.
- And it's a significant raise too!

49:59.104 --> 50:02.073
- Betty!
- What? I can say that, can't I?

50:02.240 --> 50:04.140
To Tommy and Joan?

50:04.309 --> 50:09.747
Well, it is.
So maybe a family isn't far behind.

50:10.849 --> 50:13.511
Let's take our coffee
in the sitting room, shall we?

50:13.685 --> 50:14.674
I'll help.

50:18.290 --> 50:21.453
- Keep them closed.
- All right.

50:26.364 --> 50:29.697
Beautiful! You've got everything
you've ever dreamed of.

50:29.868 --> 50:31.631
You will too.

50:32.704 --> 50:37.038
I've got a secret to tell you.
You swear you won't gab to anyone?

50:37.609 --> 50:40.737
I got accepted early
to Yale Law School.

50:40.912 --> 50:45.315
To what?! Why?!
You don't want to be a lawyer.

50:45.483 --> 50:47.246
Maybe I do.

50:47.552 --> 50:51.784
You won't switch cold creams without
asking me, but you applied to school?

50:51.957 --> 50:54.721
On a lark.
We never thought I'd get in.

50:54.893 --> 50:56.884
- Who's "we"?
- Miss Watson.

50:57.062 --> 51:00.225
She practically filled out
my application for me.

51:00.799 --> 51:03.734
You've got to be kidding me!
What right does she have?

51:03.902 --> 51:05.494
You're getting married!

51:05.670 --> 51:08.537
First of all,
there's no ring on this finger.

51:08.707 --> 51:12.199
Second, I can do both. I can.

51:12.744 --> 51:16.111
- How does Tommy feel about this?
- He doesn't know. No one does.

51:16.281 --> 51:19.307
- Not even her?
- No one.

51:19.484 --> 51:21.008
Joanie! Betty!

51:21.186 --> 51:24.155
You are this close to getting
everything you ever wanted.

51:24.322 --> 51:26.415
And this close to losing it.

51:38.236 --> 51:40.898
I just got a call.
They need me in New York tomorrow.

51:41.072 --> 51:43.870
Joan and Tommy are here.
Can't you leave in the morning?

51:44.042 --> 51:47.944
Then I'd miss the meeting.
Sorry, guys. We take a rain check?

51:48.113 --> 51:50.377
- Sure, buddy.
- We'll see you in the new year.

51:50.548 --> 51:52.448
Happy and merry.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.911
I'll call you in the morning.

52:11.036 --> 52:12.594
Coffee?

52:18.243 --> 52:21.144
Guess who has
an early Christmas present?

52:21.312 --> 52:24.941
- Oh, my! How can you live like this?
- Like what?

52:25.116 --> 52:27.482
We'll just wait for you
to tidy up a bit.

52:27.652 --> 52:31.486
In this lifetime? Lt'll never happen.
Come here, beautiful.

52:35.160 --> 52:38.027
What are you doing here?

52:38.396 --> 52:42.992
- You still like it here?
- I do. I like getting to know the girls.

52:43.168 --> 52:45.227
Most of the time.

52:45.403 --> 52:47.928
- And the weather.
- Yeah, the weather's nice.

52:48.106 --> 52:49.596
- Are you freezing?
- Yeah.

52:49.774 --> 52:52.470
- Your lips are a little blue.
- I like them that way.

52:52.644 --> 52:54.077
Why didn't you bring a coat?

53:19.304 --> 53:20.703
Bill.

53:22.407 --> 53:24.637
Giselle, what are you doing here?

53:25.844 --> 53:27.505
Freezing.

53:30.915 --> 53:35.045
Look, it's over.
I can't see you anymore.

53:35.220 --> 53:37.518
- I can't.
- I know.

53:39.023 --> 53:40.490
Really.

53:43.194 --> 53:45.628
I just want to talk to you
for a minute.

53:47.999 --> 53:49.591
Come on.

53:58.510 --> 54:00.205
Oh, I missed you.

54:01.713 --> 54:03.340
You're beautiful.

54:04.182 --> 54:06.082
Life without you...

54:06.251 --> 54:08.151
...just isn't life.

54:09.888 --> 54:13.187
And I don't want to go through life
not living. Do you?

54:13.658 --> 54:15.057
No.

54:15.293 --> 54:20.424
I love you so much I would move
to this elitist icebox if you want me to.

54:26.271 --> 54:28.637
Make an honest man out of me.

54:30.241 --> 54:32.106
Miss Watson?

54:32.477 --> 54:35.241
Hi. I didn't know you were here.

54:39.851 --> 54:43.810
Giselle Levy, Bill Dunbar,
this is...

54:43.988 --> 54:46.218
- This is my... Paul.
- Fiancé.

54:46.658 --> 54:49.650
As of about a minute and a half ago.
Paul Moore.

54:52.030 --> 54:56.160
God. Congratulations!
Your fiancé?

54:58.036 --> 54:59.833
You must be thrilled.

55:00.004 --> 55:02.472
I don't think she's caught
her breath yet.

55:02.640 --> 55:03.766
I haven't.

55:06.644 --> 55:11.172
- Well, sit down. We'll have a toast.
- We'd love to. We're in a hurry.

55:11.349 --> 55:14.477
But that's really great.
Congratulations, old man.

55:14.652 --> 55:17.917
- Congratulations. Merry Christmas.
- Come on, let's...

55:18.089 --> 55:21.616
Best of tidings to you both. Bye.

55:50.121 --> 55:51.645
No, Paul.

55:51.823 --> 55:54.587
Nancy'll have a heart attack.
She has these rules.

55:54.759 --> 55:57.193
- Come on.
- No.

55:57.896 --> 56:01.593
- Why?
- I said no. I'm not comfortable.

56:02.867 --> 56:05.563
I'll make up the convertible sofa.

56:12.777 --> 56:14.711
What are you doing?

56:17.181 --> 56:19.172
You're not kidding?

56:19.350 --> 56:24.811
I just came 3000 miles to see you.
I'm sleeping down here by myself?

56:28.660 --> 56:31.185
Stop. Stop. Stop for a second.

56:31.362 --> 56:35.059
- Tell me what the hell's going on.
- I don't know.

56:35.233 --> 56:37.633
I feel like everything
is getting away from me.

56:37.802 --> 56:42.899
We haven't actually, literally looked
at each other for three months...

56:43.074 --> 56:46.305
...and now you're here,
and I have this ring on my finger.

56:46.778 --> 56:49.372
Which makes you uncomfortable too?

56:50.348 --> 56:54.842
The last time I checked,
we weren't on this track.

56:55.186 --> 56:57.211
When was the last time
you checked?

57:18.242 --> 57:19.539
Bill...

57:21.079 --> 57:23.047
The name is Paul.

57:29.487 --> 57:32.752
I'm not saying no to you.

57:32.957 --> 57:35.289
No, you're not saying anything.

57:36.861 --> 57:38.886
You never really do.

57:58.816 --> 58:03.412
If you need me for anything else,
my number's on the refrigerator.

58:03.588 --> 58:06.250
I feel so guilty
leaving you alone after...

58:06.424 --> 58:08.949
I'm fine. I have lots of research
to do.

58:09.127 --> 58:12.722
That's right.
Throw yourself into work.

58:13.031 --> 58:14.191
I'll be back...

58:15.066 --> 58:16.897
...on the 2nd.

58:17.869 --> 58:19.734
See you next year.

58:19.904 --> 58:21.701
1954!

58:57.008 --> 58:59.977
Sunflowers. Vincent van Gogh. 1888.

59:00.144 --> 59:03.602
He painted what he felt,
not what he saw.

59:03.781 --> 59:07.182
People didn't understand. To them,
it seemed childlike and crude.

59:07.351 --> 59:10.582
It took years for them to recognize
his actual technique...

59:10.755 --> 59:14.623
...to see the way his brush strokes
seemed to make the night sky move.

59:14.792 --> 59:18.523
Yet, he never sold a painting
in his lifetime.

59:18.696 --> 59:20.687
This is his self-portrait.

59:20.865 --> 59:25.131
There's no camouflage, no romance.
Honesty.

59:25.303 --> 59:30.673
- Now, 60 years later, where is he?
- Famous?

59:30.842 --> 59:34.744
So famous, in fact,
that everybody has a reproduction.

59:34.912 --> 59:37.938
- There are post cards...
- We have the calendar.

59:38.116 --> 59:42.610
With the ability to reproduce art,
it is available to the masses.

59:42.787 --> 59:45.085
No one needs to own
a van Gogh original.

59:45.256 --> 59:48.191
We do. In the Newport house.

59:48.993 --> 59:52.053
But it's small. Tiny.

59:55.566 --> 59:58.831
They can paint their own.
Van Gogh in a box, ladies.

59:59.003 --> 01:00:02.063
The newest form
of mass-distributed art:

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.832
Paint by numbers.

01:00:04.008 --> 01:00:07.034
"Now everyone can be van Gogh.
It's so easy.

01:00:07.211 --> 01:00:09.475
Just follow the simple instructions...

01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:12.616
...and in minutes, you're on
your way to being an artist."

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:15.619
Van Gogh by numbers?

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:19.415
Ironic, isn't it? Look at what
we have done to the man...

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:23.219
...who refused to conform
his ideals to popular taste.

01:00:23.394 --> 01:00:26.454
Who refused to compromise
his integrity.

01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:32.194
We have put him in a tiny box
and asked you to copy him.

01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:34.498
So the choice is yours, ladies.

01:00:34.672 --> 01:00:39.109
You can conform to what
other people expect or you can...

01:00:39.277 --> 01:00:42.246
I know. Be ourselves.

01:00:43.214 --> 01:00:45.114
You're a sight for sore eyes.

01:00:45.283 --> 01:00:49.583
I would've been on time but, silly me,
I thought class was in the classroom.

01:00:49.754 --> 01:00:53.554
Glad you could join us, Mrs. Jones.
We thought we'd lost you.

01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:56.385
- There's an unwritten rule for marr...
- Don't bother.

01:00:56.561 --> 01:01:00.554
Since your wedding, you've missed
six classes, a paper and your midterm.

01:01:00.731 --> 01:01:04.189
Well, thank God I didn't miss
the paint-by-numbers lecture.

01:01:04.502 --> 01:01:08.029
I was on my honeymoon
and then I had to set up house.

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:11.232
- What does she expect?
- Attendance.

01:01:12.877 --> 01:01:14.868
Most of the faculty turn their heads...

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:17.947
...when the married students
miss a class or two.

01:01:18.115 --> 01:01:20.106
Then why not get married
as freshmen?

01:01:20.284 --> 01:01:25.381
That way you could graduate without
actually ever stepping foot on campus.

01:01:26.657 --> 01:01:30.957
Don't disregard our traditions
just because you're subversive.

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:35.228
Don't disrespect this class
just because you're married.

01:01:35.399 --> 01:01:37.833
Don't disrespect me
just because you're not.

01:01:38.002 --> 01:01:41.199
Come to class, do the work,
or I'll fail you.

01:01:41.372 --> 01:01:44.466
If you fail me,
there will be consequences.

01:01:45.776 --> 01:01:49.473
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm educating you.

01:01:49.947 --> 01:01:51.778
That's my job.

01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:35.552
Miss Watson!

01:02:36.193 --> 01:02:38.024
Miss Watson!

01:02:40.731 --> 01:02:41.891
What's this?

01:02:42.066 --> 01:02:46.093
Every year, the ARs nominate a
member of the faculty to be our guest.

01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.635
The what?

01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:51.366
You'll see. Come by tonight at 5:00.

01:02:54.211 --> 01:02:57.908
Adam's Ribs. A very secret society.

01:02:58.082 --> 01:02:59.447
Wait here.

01:03:08.092 --> 01:03:11.391
First, the oath.
Please raise both hands.

01:03:13.064 --> 01:03:16.227
Do you swear not to repeat what
you see, hear or smell tonight?

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.890
- Smell?
- Keep your hands up!

01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:20.162
Yes, smell.

01:03:20.438 --> 01:03:21.871
I do.

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:42.222
It'll only burn for a second.

01:03:42.393 --> 01:03:43.951
Go on.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:59.939
And now that you've taken the oath,
we get to ask you whatever we want.

01:04:00.111 --> 01:04:04.309
- Oh, is that how it works?
- And you have to answer.

01:04:04.882 --> 01:04:06.008
Who invited her?

01:04:06.183 --> 01:04:08.378
You're in time
for truth or consequences.

01:04:08.552 --> 01:04:11.885
I go first. Why aren't you married?

01:04:14.091 --> 01:04:15.615
Well...

01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:19.088
That's poisonous.

01:04:19.263 --> 01:04:22.994
I'm not married because...

01:04:23.434 --> 01:04:24.992
...l'm not.

01:04:25.903 --> 01:04:30.363
I was engaged to Patrick Watts.

01:04:30.674 --> 01:04:34.269
Everybody called him Leo,
and I never knew why.

01:04:34.445 --> 01:04:39.405
He was the first person
that I ever danced with...

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:44.486
...or smoked with,
got incredibly drunk with and...

01:04:44.655 --> 01:04:48.022
Well, a lot of first things.

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:53.658
We were 18 and getting married,
Christmas of '41.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:58.368
Then Pearl Harbor happened
and everything changed.

01:04:58.536 --> 01:05:02.700
Everybody changed.
And by June, he was sent overseas.

01:05:02.907 --> 01:05:04.738
- Did he come back?
- Yes.

01:05:04.909 --> 01:05:07.537
- Was he changed?
- They both were.

01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:12.539
I'm sorry.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:15.946
- Your parents?
- Yeah.

01:05:17.888 --> 01:05:19.822
After the war...

01:05:20.524 --> 01:05:24.961
...they didn't know each other
anymore, didn't like each other.

01:05:26.897 --> 01:05:29.889
He left. He got a whole new family.

01:05:31.702 --> 01:05:33.226
Divorce.

01:05:33.404 --> 01:05:34.462
What?

01:05:34.638 --> 01:05:38.631
Yeah. First on my block.
That's a city block.

01:05:41.045 --> 01:05:45.311
People change. Things happen.
It's the same with me and Leo.

01:05:45.716 --> 01:05:48.378
He went off and married
someone else.

01:05:48.686 --> 01:05:52.178
- And I got to go to graduate school.
- UCLA, right?

01:05:52.356 --> 01:05:55.553
- Which is in Hollywood?
- It's close.

01:05:55.726 --> 01:06:00.925
Anyway, aren't you gonna tell
everybody about, you know...

01:06:01.632 --> 01:06:04.294
...your big news?
- What are you talking about?

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:07.869
- She got engaged over Christmas!
- Congratulations!

01:06:08.038 --> 01:06:11.098
I'm sorry to blab.
It's just so romantic.

01:06:11.275 --> 01:06:13.038
How fantastic!

01:06:13.777 --> 01:06:15.540
We split up.

01:06:17.948 --> 01:06:21.247
- What?
- We split up.

01:06:23.087 --> 01:06:24.714
Well, that was fast.

01:06:24.889 --> 01:06:28.222
Well, not every relationship
is meant for marriage.

01:06:28.392 --> 01:06:31.623
- Some are strictly affairs?
- Bill Dunbar.

01:06:31.795 --> 01:06:35.026
He'd be an affair. Let's talk
about that, Miss Watson.

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:37.224
You don't believe in withholding,
do you?

01:06:37.401 --> 01:06:42.100
No. I do, however, believe in manners.
But for you, I'll make an exception.

01:06:42.273 --> 01:06:46.175
That's what we're supposed to do
for married students. Right, Betty?

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:50.942
Professor Dunbar and I
are not having an affair.

01:06:51.115 --> 01:06:52.946
Did you have one
with William Holden?

01:06:53.117 --> 01:06:55.142
- Connie!
- She asked about Bill Dunbar.

01:06:55.319 --> 01:06:58.152
- How did you hear that?
- Oh, it is true!

01:06:58.322 --> 01:06:59.619
Betty, I told you.

01:07:03.127 --> 01:07:06.358
- Won't you regret never marrying?
- There's still time.

01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:08.657
I guess I assume that I will
at some point.

01:07:08.832 --> 01:07:11.892
- I'm not gonna plan my life around it.
- Neither should we.

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:13.900
- I didn't say that.
- You did to Joan.

01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:16.596
- That's what she told me.
- What are you saying?

01:07:16.774 --> 01:07:19.004
She knew you and Tommy
were getting engaged.

01:07:19.176 --> 01:07:21.610
And she practically filled out
your application.

01:07:21.779 --> 01:07:24.111
- I didn't say that.
- She's been accepted.

01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:27.580
Now she just has to figure out
a way to tell Tommy.

01:07:28.819 --> 01:07:32.186
Why don't you do it? You're good
at butting into people's business.

01:07:32.356 --> 01:07:35.917
Funny, that's what they say
about you.

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:41.989
- Spencer, do I look all right?
- Yeah, fine.

01:07:42.166 --> 01:07:45.294
- I don't have a lot of time. Speed it up.
- Mr. Grouchy.

01:07:45.769 --> 01:07:49.364
- All right, here we go again.
- All right, go ahead, Louise.

01:07:50.341 --> 01:07:54.937
Married Wellesley girls have become
quite adept at balancing obligations.

01:07:55.212 --> 01:07:56.839
One hears such comments as:

01:07:57.014 --> 01:08:01.576
"I baste the chicken with one hand
and outline the paper with the other."

01:08:01.752 --> 01:08:04.949
While our mothers were called
to work for Lady Liberty...

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:10.116
...it is our duty, nay, obligation
to reclaim our place in the home...

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:14.856
...bearing the children that will carry
our traditions into the future.

01:08:15.032 --> 01:08:18.899
One must pause to consider why
Miss Katherine Watson...

01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:21.367
...instructor in the Art History
department...

01:08:21.537 --> 01:08:25.474
...has decided to declare war
on the holy sacrament of marriage.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:29.272
Her subversive and political teachings
encourage our Wellesley girls...

01:08:29.446 --> 01:08:33.006
...to reject the roles
they were born to fill.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.831
Thank you.

01:09:11.988 --> 01:09:14.184
Slide.

01:09:16.426 --> 01:09:18.895
- Contemporary art.
- That's just an advertisement.

01:09:19.063 --> 01:09:20.689
Quiet!

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:25.194
Today you just listen.

01:09:27.071 --> 01:09:30.939
What will the future scholars see
when they study us?

01:09:32.743 --> 01:09:36.439
A portrait of women today?

01:09:39.249 --> 01:09:40.716
There you are, ladies.

01:09:41.685 --> 01:09:44.210
The perfect likeness
of a Wellesley graduate.

01:09:44.388 --> 01:09:50.054
Magna cum laude, doing exactly
what she was trained to do.

01:09:50.227 --> 01:09:51.488
Slide.

01:09:53.197 --> 01:09:54.459
A Rhodes scholar.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.668
I wonder if she recites Chaucer while
she presses her husband's shirts.

01:10:00.838 --> 01:10:02.100
Slide.

01:10:04.007 --> 01:10:08.034
Now, you physics majors can calculate
the mass and volume...

01:10:08.212 --> 01:10:10.976
...of every meat loaf you make.
Slide.

01:10:12.015 --> 01:10:14.449
A girdle to set you free.

01:10:14.618 --> 01:10:16.779
What does that mean?

01:10:21.925 --> 01:10:24.120
What does that mean?

01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:27.522
What does it mean?

01:10:31.902 --> 01:10:33.995
I give up.

01:10:36.039 --> 01:10:38.030
You win.

01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:43.009
The smartest women in the country.

01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:50.848
I didn't realize that
by demanding excellence...

01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:54.222
...I would be challenging...

01:10:56.493 --> 01:10:58.620
What did it say?

01:11:00.731 --> 01:11:02.323
What did it say?

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:08.238
"The roles you were born to fill."

01:11:09.139 --> 01:11:11.073
Is that right?

01:11:14.745 --> 01:11:17.373
The roles you were born to fill?

01:11:24.688 --> 01:11:27.122
It's my mistake.

01:11:40.103 --> 01:11:42.435
Class dismissed.

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:59.179
These girls...
Are you proud, President Carr?

01:11:59.356 --> 01:12:03.383
- Yes, actually, I am.
- Well, you should be, I guess.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.996
Half of them are married.
The other half, give it a month or so.

01:12:07.164 --> 01:12:09.291
It's really only a matter of time.

01:12:09.466 --> 01:12:11.730
They're biding time
until somebody proposes!

01:12:11.902 --> 01:12:14.769
A hundred years ago, it was
inconceivable for a woman...

01:12:14.938 --> 01:12:16.428
...to be a college graduate.

01:12:16.607 --> 01:12:19.440
Perhaps you should look back
to see how far we've come.

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:22.977
I'm sorry, from where I sit,
it's just a different kind of corset.

01:12:23.146 --> 01:12:27.207
- Well, we can all use a little support.
- Oh, like Amanda Armstrong?

01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:29.716
- She broke the law!
- According to Betty Warren.

01:12:29.887 --> 01:12:32.321
According to the state
of Massachusetts.

01:12:36.293 --> 01:12:38.488
To hell with Wellesley.
I'm done.

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:42.530
Goddamn it!

01:12:44.801 --> 01:12:47.269
It's brilliant, really.
A perfect ruse.

01:12:47.437 --> 01:12:50.304
A finishing school disguised
as a college. They got me.

01:12:50.474 --> 01:12:52.408
- What do you expect?
- More. More.

01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:56.239
I thought it was a place for
tomorrow's leaders, not their wives.

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:58.244
- Calm down, please.
- No, I will not!

01:12:58.415 --> 01:13:01.680
I've got 10 more minutes.
Meet me in my office. Meet me!

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:32.280
- How you feeling?
- Stupid. Deceived.

01:13:32.516 --> 01:13:35.485
Really, really angry.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:42.415
Change takes time, you know?
You gotta let them catch up with you.

01:13:43.393 --> 01:13:46.021
Katherine, this place needs you.

01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:51.124
I don't know how the hell they let
you in, but I'm sure glad they did.

01:13:54.204 --> 01:13:59.039
The things I said to President Carr.
She'll never let me back in.

01:13:59.209 --> 01:14:00.972
She's a pretty good egg.

01:14:02.279 --> 01:14:04.474
What things?

01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:06.707
Don't worry.

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:08.981
Time will heal it.

01:14:09.152 --> 01:14:13.145
Unless, of course, you want to go back
to California and that fiancé of yours.

01:14:14.591 --> 01:14:17.685
We're not engaged. Thanks.

01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:21.058
Sorry I interrupted your class.

01:14:31.274 --> 01:14:32.901
Katherine!

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:41.640
I wanted to give you this.
It was for Christmas, and...

01:14:41.885 --> 01:14:44.752
Then I met your man, so I...

01:15:01.104 --> 01:15:03.595
The Sistine Chapel.

01:15:04.274 --> 01:15:06.071
David.

01:15:06.643 --> 01:15:09.737
Venus de Milo. And...

01:15:10.547 --> 01:15:12.242
...Mona Lisa.

01:15:14.985 --> 01:15:16.976
Thank you.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:28.126
This is gonna be
a three-in-one shot. Ready?

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:33.092
You didn't even try.

01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:37.970
This game is probably a no-no
in the Better Homes and Gardens.

01:15:38.141 --> 01:15:42.305
Not that I have ever been in the
better homes and gardens. Have you?

01:15:42.479 --> 01:15:44.640
No. No, I'm just an old soldier.

01:15:44.815 --> 01:15:48.581
They don't invite us.

01:15:48.752 --> 01:15:50.845
What do they say about them though?

01:15:51.021 --> 01:15:53.751
- Old soldiers never die. We just...
- They just...

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:57.382
...become philandering
Italian professors.

01:15:57.561 --> 01:15:59.688
- That was below the belt.
- That was unkind.

01:15:59.863 --> 01:16:01.296
Deeply unkind.

01:16:15.946 --> 01:16:19.404
You know, I don't know how I feel
about being a rebound.

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:23.781
- I'll leave.
- No, you don't have to do that.

01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:26.218
I'll get used to it.

01:16:26.456 --> 01:16:29.721
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.

01:16:29.893 --> 01:16:33.852
I had fun, and I'm not looking
for anything serious.

01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:36.726
Why don't you come down here
and we can discuss it.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:41.166
But as long as we're doing
whatever it is that we're doing...

01:16:41.338 --> 01:16:44.171
Which we did pretty well,
don't you think?

01:16:47.444 --> 01:16:49.036
No students.

01:16:50.847 --> 01:16:53.247
I'm serious.

01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:59.016
I don't want to teach a class wondering
why a girl is wearing my perfume.

01:17:00.857 --> 01:17:03.951
- Katherine, l...
- I need your word.

01:17:07.631 --> 01:17:09.098
All right, you have my word.

01:17:11.868 --> 01:17:14.166
- Okay.
- Now can we change the subject?

01:17:14.337 --> 01:17:18.034
Talk about something
a little more interesting?

01:17:18.208 --> 01:17:21.336
Like breakfast.

01:17:21.778 --> 01:17:24.110
You know, I make
a mean blueberry pancake.

01:17:24.281 --> 01:17:26.215
I just put that shoe on.

01:17:26.383 --> 01:17:29.011
I don't think I know you
well enough for breakfast.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:30.881
I don't know about that.

01:17:34.591 --> 01:17:36.650
So how does a guy
get to know you better?

01:17:36.826 --> 01:17:40.819
Well, let me...
That's a good idea.

01:17:48.605 --> 01:17:51.073
Is that a battle wound you have?

01:17:54.911 --> 01:17:59.041
I'm a sucker for war stories
in Romance languages.

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.548
- Well, that's pretty easy.
- Yeah?

01:18:03.353 --> 01:18:09.314
I was in a village... called San Remo...

01:18:11.428 --> 01:18:15.330
...the Krauts pounded us hard...

01:18:15.498 --> 01:18:17.056
...me & Stan...

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:22.033
...you remember Stan? We were the
only two left from our platoon.

01:18:22.305 --> 01:18:29.643
We heard a distant cry coming
from an abandoned shed.

01:18:30.447 --> 01:18:32.039
When night fell...

01:18:32.682 --> 01:18:34.047
A trap it was?

01:18:37.354 --> 01:18:38.844
Remember...

01:18:39.656 --> 01:18:42.216
...invert your nouns and
your verbs.

01:19:06.883 --> 01:19:08.510
- Hungry?
- Famished.

01:19:08.685 --> 01:19:11.779
Don't say we can live on love.
That's how I missed breakfast.

01:19:16.026 --> 01:19:17.857
What's the matter?

01:19:19.195 --> 01:19:22.631
- What's the matter?
- Phillip and Vanessa Mclntyre.

01:19:22.799 --> 01:19:25.393
- Parents of a friend.
- You wanna say a quick hello?

01:19:25.568 --> 01:19:28.560
No! No, I'll be trapped.

01:19:28.738 --> 01:19:30.501
Damn it!

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:36.305
- Could you seat us in the bar?
- We're only serving...

01:19:36.479 --> 01:19:39.539
...in the front part of the restaurant
this afternoon.

01:19:43.386 --> 01:19:46.048
Miss! Miss Stone.

01:19:46.222 --> 01:19:50.886
This has been the most romantic
weekend I may ever have.

01:19:51.061 --> 01:19:55.191
Ever. And all that's standing
between right now and perfection...

01:19:55.432 --> 01:19:57.696
...are the Mclntyres over there.

01:19:57.867 --> 01:20:03.100
Now, with the competition out there,
a girl's got to be able to move...

01:20:03.273 --> 01:20:06.037
...a few mountains
every once in a while.

01:20:06.209 --> 01:20:09.975
- I could use all the help I could get.
- Come this way.

01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:18.848
- I fixed it. No more Mclntyres.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:21.157 --> 01:20:24.718
- Let's not talk about this.
- All right.

01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:29.557
Hold your breath and...

01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:33.893
And turn.

01:20:34.437 --> 01:20:37.770
Don't forget to smile.

01:20:38.842 --> 01:20:40.639
Arms up.

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:43.472
Move together. Faster, Fran!

01:20:44.647 --> 01:20:48.083
- When you surface, smile.
- Come on, Connie!

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.212
How about we have a girls' luncheon
this weekend? Just us.

01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:57.492
- Where's Spencer?
- Away.

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.855
- I'm free.
- I'm busy.

01:21:00.029 --> 01:21:02.554
- What are you doing?
- She's dating a psychoanalyst.

01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:04.495
- Oh, really?
- Who's married.

01:21:04.667 --> 01:21:07.261
- Giselle!
- Sorry, it slipped.

01:21:07.437 --> 01:21:09.803
- Are you in, Connie?
- I'll check with Charlie.

01:21:09.973 --> 01:21:12.908
- Who?
- Charlie Stewart. Your cousin.

01:21:13.076 --> 01:21:15.135
You're kidding?

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.210
We spent last weekend at the Cape.

01:21:20.383 --> 01:21:24.012
- A little hideaway he knew about.
- Operative word, "hide."

01:21:24.187 --> 01:21:27.520
Men take women to the Cape in
the winter when they're embarrassed.

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:30.853
- He's using you.
- He's not using you if you want to go.

01:21:31.027 --> 01:21:32.756
Come here. Don't listen to her.

01:21:33.496 --> 01:21:36.397
I love you, and I swear
I'm not saying this to hurt you.

01:21:36.566 --> 01:21:40.593
Charlie's promised to Deb Mclntyre.
She wears his pin.

01:21:41.404 --> 01:21:45.135
- Giselle, you know it's true.
- I don't know anything about a pin.

01:21:45.308 --> 01:21:47.299
Mclntyre?

01:21:47.744 --> 01:21:50.611
Are her parents named
Phillip and Vanessa?

01:21:51.214 --> 01:21:53.079
You know them?

01:21:54.751 --> 01:21:56.514
Only from a distance.

01:22:09.365 --> 01:22:13.165
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Goodbye. Good morning.

01:22:13.336 --> 01:22:15.827
Okay, wait. No, we have an audience.
Don't look.

01:22:18.441 --> 01:22:20.602
No, I don't...
No. Stop it. Put me down.

01:22:20.777 --> 01:22:23.075
Put me down.
You're not coming in this house.

01:22:23.246 --> 01:22:26.613
You are not coming
in this house. No.

01:22:26.783 --> 01:22:28.546
- Bye. Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:22:28.718 --> 01:22:30.686
Go away. Go away.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:42.697
How can you date a man like that?

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:46.700
What if you're wrong about him?

01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:49.031
What if I'm not?

01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:56.678
Coffee's cold.

01:23:17.867 --> 01:23:19.357
Row!

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:20.935
Ride the plank!

01:23:21.104 --> 01:23:23.299
Row!

01:23:45.328 --> 01:23:47.728
Are your ears burning?

01:23:48.431 --> 01:23:51.491
I think the feet go first
when they set the stake on fire.

01:23:51.668 --> 01:23:54.432
"What do you say, Edward?
Should we have her back?"

01:23:54.604 --> 01:23:56.868
"She's got rather nice legs."

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.099
- Who's to say I wanna come back?
- What...

01:23:59.275 --> 01:24:02.073
...leave me here with all these girls?

01:24:12.121 --> 01:24:14.419
You'd think someone
would notice empty trays.

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:17.958
You are good. You remind me
of myself when I was your age.

01:24:32.909 --> 01:24:34.809
Cheers.

01:24:35.044 --> 01:24:38.912
He's positively vomititious, Giselle.

01:24:39.215 --> 01:24:41.843
Don't be so sentimental, Connie.

01:24:43.019 --> 01:24:46.318
It was a fling. It's fine.
It was nothing.

01:24:55.298 --> 01:24:57.266
Hi!

01:24:58.434 --> 01:25:00.368
Pleasure to meet you.

01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:08.600
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.

01:25:09.512 --> 01:25:12.743
Connie! Connie!
Excuse me. Sorry. Connie!

01:25:12.915 --> 01:25:15.816
Charlie. It's been a while.

01:25:15.985 --> 01:25:18.852
Yeah. How are you?

01:25:19.088 --> 01:25:21.750
I'm fine, thank you. You? Deb?

01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:26.254
- Pardon?
- Deb. Your girlfriend.

01:25:26.429 --> 01:25:28.260
With the very large...

01:25:28.431 --> 01:25:30.194
With the very large teeth.

01:25:30.366 --> 01:25:32.664
With the very large teeth.

01:25:32.835 --> 01:25:36.794
- Oh, did you think I didn't know?
- Connie.

01:25:36.973 --> 01:25:40.932
Deb and I broke it off last summer.
That's Miranda.

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:46.742
We started seeing each other when
you stopped returning my calls...

01:25:46.916 --> 01:25:49.885
...or answering any of my letters.

01:25:55.591 --> 01:25:57.081
Okay, maybe I should go.

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.037
Have you seen Spencer?

01:26:25.788 --> 01:26:28.621
But I did see Charlie Stewart.

01:26:30.193 --> 01:26:33.959
And he told me that he and Deb
broke up last summer.

01:26:34.664 --> 01:26:38.964
And you told me they were together
when he invited me to the Cape.

01:26:39.135 --> 01:26:42.161
Oh, Connie.
I don't keep track of his dates.

01:26:42.338 --> 01:26:46.866
They've been on-again, off-again
for the past few years.

01:26:47.043 --> 01:26:51.173
No, apparently they've been
off-again for a while. For quite a while.

01:26:51.347 --> 01:26:54.316
- So?
- So you made me believe...

01:26:54.484 --> 01:26:57.112
...that he was hiding me.

01:26:59.288 --> 01:27:01.620
Either way...

01:27:01.791 --> 01:27:04.624
...why couldn't you let me be happy?

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:12.800
Betty.

01:27:36.292 --> 01:27:38.590
And we switch.

01:27:40.496 --> 01:27:43.294
- Wonder teacher.
- Tommy.

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:49.162
- How's Harvard?
- Oh, not too bad. Not too bad.

01:27:49.338 --> 01:27:51.829
- Congratulate me.
- You set a date?

01:27:54.377 --> 01:27:56.402
No, nothing official. Yet.

01:27:56.579 --> 01:27:59.571
I meant, I got into Penn. Grad school.

01:28:00.049 --> 01:28:03.018
Congratulations. What about Yale?

01:28:03.619 --> 01:28:08.886
Yale? Oh, you mean Joanie.
Yeah. How about that, huh?

01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:11.685
She is some girl.

01:28:11.861 --> 01:28:14.421
- She's terrific.
- Yeah.

01:28:14.597 --> 01:28:19.830
Just the fact that she got in.
I mean, she will always have that.

01:28:20.002 --> 01:28:23.938
Thanks to you. Miss Watson,
you've been real swell to her.

01:28:24.106 --> 01:28:26.700
We both appreciate it.

01:28:28.110 --> 01:28:31.409
I'm sorry. "The fact that she got in,"
what does that mean?

01:28:31.581 --> 01:28:34.880
Well, she'll be in Philadelphia.

01:28:35.051 --> 01:28:36.518
With me.

01:28:39.789 --> 01:28:43.885
Well, that's an awful long commute
to get dinner on the table by 5:00.

01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:48.259
- And we switch.
- Thank you.

01:28:54.303 --> 01:28:56.134
Excuse me.

01:28:56.405 --> 01:28:59.772
Excuse me. Have you seen Spencer?
I can't find him anywhere.

01:29:03.512 --> 01:29:07.312
Actually, Spencer asked me
to take you home.

01:29:07.483 --> 01:29:11.613
- He has this meeting...
- In New York.

01:29:12.021 --> 01:29:13.886
Thank you.

01:29:42.551 --> 01:29:45.987
- Honey, what are you doing here?
- I'm staying the night.

01:29:46.155 --> 01:29:49.955
- Spencer won't mind?
- Spencer won't notice.

01:29:50.126 --> 01:29:55.758
- He's in New York again. Working.
- He's working hard for both of you.

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:59.766
Don't lie for him, Mother.
He does it so well for himself.

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:02.427
You're going to turn around,
go home...

01:30:02.605 --> 01:30:04.903
...fix your face
and wait for your husband.

01:30:05.074 --> 01:30:08.271
This is the bargain you made,
Elizabeth. We all did.

01:30:08.444 --> 01:30:10.878
So you're not gonna let me
stay in my own house?

01:30:11.047 --> 01:30:13.208
Spencer's house is your house now.

01:30:13.382 --> 01:30:17.341
Believe me, it's for your own good.

01:30:34.403 --> 01:30:37.201
Miss Watson. Come in.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.404
Seven law schools within 45 minutes
of Philadelphia.

01:30:40.576 --> 01:30:43.306
You can study and get dinner
on the table by 5:00.

01:30:43.479 --> 01:30:46.312
- It's too late.
- No. Some accept late admissions.

01:30:46.482 --> 01:30:48.643
- I was upset at first.
- Joan, the guests.

01:30:48.818 --> 01:30:51.787
When Tommy told me that he got
accepted to Penn, I thought:

01:30:51.954 --> 01:30:54.752
"Her fate is sealed.
How can she throw it all away?"

01:30:54.924 --> 01:30:58.724
I realized you won't have to. You
could bake your cake and eat it too.

01:30:58.894 --> 01:31:01.124
We're married.

01:31:02.431 --> 01:31:04.262
We eloped over the weekend.

01:31:04.433 --> 01:31:07.197
Turned out he was petrified
of a big ceremony...

01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:10.464
...so we did a sort of
spur-of-the-moment thing.

01:31:10.639 --> 01:31:12.573
Very romantic.

01:31:12.742 --> 01:31:14.505
Look.

01:31:22.918 --> 01:31:25.045
It's beautiful.

01:31:28.057 --> 01:31:32.858
It was my choice. Not to go.
He would have supported it.

01:31:33.462 --> 01:31:37.057
- But you don't have to choose.
- No, I have to.

01:31:37.233 --> 01:31:40.202
I want a home, a family.
It's not something I'll sacrifice.

01:31:40.369 --> 01:31:43.532
No one's asking you
to sacrifice that, Joan.

01:31:43.706 --> 01:31:46.436
I just want you to understand
that you can do both.

01:31:46.609 --> 01:31:49.476
Think I'll wake up one day
and regret not being a lawyer?

01:31:49.645 --> 01:31:51.203
Yes, I'm afraid that you will.

01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:55.817
Not as much as I'd regret not having
a family. Not being there to raise them.

01:31:55.985 --> 01:32:00.388
I know exactly what I'm doing, and
it doesn't make me any less smart.

01:32:01.257 --> 01:32:04.283
- This must seem terrible to you.
- I didn't say that. I...

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:07.486
Sure you did. You always do.

01:32:07.663 --> 01:32:11.360
You stand in class and tell us to look
beyond the image, but you don't.

01:32:11.534 --> 01:32:15.436
To you, a housewife is someone who
sold her soul for a center hall colonial.

01:32:15.604 --> 01:32:19.404
She has no depth,
no intellect, no interests.

01:32:22.178 --> 01:32:25.978
You're the one who said
I could do anything I wanted.

01:32:26.148 --> 01:32:28.514
This is what I want.

01:32:33.089 --> 01:32:35.250
Congratulations.

01:32:35.424 --> 01:32:37.449
Be happy.

01:32:58.514 --> 01:33:02.610
Sometimes I think you say
these things to provoke me.

01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:05.754
Does your father know
that you speak this way?

01:33:10.259 --> 01:33:13.057
Does your wife know you're here?

01:33:50.766 --> 01:33:54.429
- Where might I find Charlie Stewart?
- Charlie Stewart? C1744.

01:33:54.603 --> 01:33:57.868
- But it's too late. You'll have to leave.
- All right.

01:34:02.511 --> 01:34:04.672
You can't go up there!

01:34:07.917 --> 01:34:09.782
What is going on here?

01:34:09.952 --> 01:34:12.284
There's no women allowed
in the dorms!

01:34:14.156 --> 01:34:17.284
Can you please not interrupt me?!

01:34:18.861 --> 01:34:23.992
Connie! What are you doing here?

01:34:25.901 --> 01:34:27.266
Well, I saw...

01:34:27.436 --> 01:34:29.529
I saw Big Teeth with...

01:34:29.705 --> 01:34:33.300
...Kevin Tawil looking pretty cozy,
and I thought that maybe...

01:34:33.475 --> 01:34:36.069
Maybe you two weren't...

01:34:36.979 --> 01:34:40.710
- Dating?
- Yes. Thank you.

01:34:40.983 --> 01:34:43.144
Hey, no girls in the dorm.

01:34:47.156 --> 01:34:50.387
I know I have made mistakes.
A ton.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.793
But I never make them twice.

01:35:13.115 --> 01:35:14.639
And?

01:35:15.217 --> 01:35:20.814
And it was perfect. Romantic.
We stayed up all night talking.

01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:23.322
You're late. What happened
to Sunday brunch?

01:35:23.492 --> 01:35:26.689
We stayed up all night too.
Not talking.

01:35:27.329 --> 01:35:30.662
The psychoanalyst? Again.

01:35:32.568 --> 01:35:35.628
- Divine exhaustion.
- He's married.

01:35:35.804 --> 01:35:37.601
He's not married like
you and Tommy.

01:35:37.773 --> 01:35:39.206
What does that mean?

01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:42.503
It means he and his wife
don't speak the same language.

01:35:42.678 --> 01:35:45.442
- Spelled S-E-X.
- Does he pay you?

01:35:45.614 --> 01:35:47.138
For sex?

01:35:47.483 --> 01:35:50.008
At the rate you're going,
you could make a fortune.

01:35:50.552 --> 01:35:53.953
- Betty.
- Everyone thinks so.

01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:57.820
Do you know what they say?
They say you're a whore.

01:35:58.327 --> 01:36:02.354
Once they've all sampled you,
they'll toss you aside like a used rag.

01:36:02.531 --> 01:36:05.364
- Betty, stop now.
- The men you love don't want you.

01:36:05.534 --> 01:36:08.901
- Your father doesn't want you.
- I'm gonna meet you downstairs.

01:36:09.071 --> 01:36:11.096
- Professor Dunbar.
- Betty, that's enough.

01:36:11.273 --> 01:36:14.003
Everybody knows that you hide
outside his house.

01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:17.872
It must be torturous running after
a man who doesn't care about you...

01:36:18.314 --> 01:36:21.613
...who's in love with someone else,
who hates you.

01:36:21.784 --> 01:36:24.116
- He hates you!
- Betty.

01:36:24.286 --> 01:36:26.220
And it hurts! No!

01:36:26.388 --> 01:36:29.380
- Get off me!
- Quiet!

01:36:38.467 --> 01:36:40.458
Oh, God.

01:36:42.271 --> 01:36:45.570
- He doesn't want me.
- Okay.

01:36:45.774 --> 01:36:48.868
He doesn't sleep with me. He...

01:36:49.178 --> 01:36:50.702
I know.

01:37:03.125 --> 01:37:07.323
I say no. I mean, it's not fair to her.

01:37:07.496 --> 01:37:11.125
- She's not happy.
- Don't forget about her outburst.

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:13.427
Oh, that's right.

01:37:13.702 --> 01:37:17.297
Dr. Staunton, will you tell the
alumnae the figures you have?

01:37:17.473 --> 01:37:20.442
Enrollment for her class next year...

01:37:20.609 --> 01:37:25.103
...is the highest
the department's had. Ever.

01:37:26.115 --> 01:37:28.777
She'd have to promise
to turn in her lesson plans.

01:37:29.184 --> 01:37:33.086
In advance. And they'll need
to be approved.

01:37:33.255 --> 01:37:35.246
She'll never agree to that.

01:37:44.466 --> 01:37:47.594
Bill, the brochures
for Europe arrived.

01:37:52.107 --> 01:37:54.007
Surprise!

01:37:54.343 --> 01:37:57.039
Sir, I'm so sorry!

01:37:57.212 --> 01:37:59.703
- Who are you?
- I'm Stanley Sher...

01:37:59.882 --> 01:38:02.476
...a friend of Bill's.
We were in the 37th together.

01:38:02.651 --> 01:38:05.415
- Okay.
- You must be Katherine.

01:38:05.587 --> 01:38:07.578
I am.

01:38:07.756 --> 01:38:11.283
He told me you were a looker, but...

01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:17.198
- I'll wait for you downstairs, Stanley.
- Okey-dokey.

01:38:21.136 --> 01:38:23.400
So you and Bill
were in the war together?

01:38:23.572 --> 01:38:27.099
Yep. Now he's some
fancy teacher...

01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:29.642
...and I'm in air conditioning.

01:38:29.812 --> 01:38:31.302
Forget the A-bomb.

01:38:32.247 --> 01:38:35.148
Freon. It's gonna change
the good old U.S. Of A.

01:38:35.517 --> 01:38:39.510
Open the entire West to development.
I'm based in El Paso.

01:38:39.955 --> 01:38:42.822
- Oh, thank you.
- And cheers.

01:38:45.694 --> 01:38:48.162
Well, you've come a long way
from San Remo.

01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:50.264
Yes, sirree.

01:38:50.866 --> 01:38:53.027
That in California?

01:38:53.735 --> 01:38:55.259
Italy.

01:38:55.437 --> 01:38:58.838
- Where you two were stationed.
- Italy?

01:38:59.007 --> 01:39:01.475
Well, somebody's been
pulling your long leg.

01:39:01.643 --> 01:39:05.875
We were stationed at the Army
Language Institute on Long Island.

01:39:06.048 --> 01:39:09.984
Closest we ever got to Italy
was the baked ziti at Mama Leone's.

01:39:10.152 --> 01:39:13.087
I don't think Bill's
ever been to Europe.

01:39:13.255 --> 01:39:15.416
I sure as hell haven't.

01:39:15.824 --> 01:39:17.086
Cheers.

01:39:27.269 --> 01:39:29.203
Katherine!

01:39:33.208 --> 01:39:34.937
You okay?

01:39:35.911 --> 01:39:37.970
I met Stan.

01:39:38.914 --> 01:39:40.176
Hell of a nice guy.

01:39:40.349 --> 01:39:42.112
- Yeah.
- What a talker.

01:39:42.284 --> 01:39:44.218
Yeah.

01:39:44.386 --> 01:39:47.446
We go back a long way.

01:39:47.623 --> 01:39:50.148
All the way to Long Island.

01:39:54.096 --> 01:39:56.326
Secret's out.

01:39:57.833 --> 01:40:00.563
What an incredible lie.

01:40:03.639 --> 01:40:07.234
I spoke the language, I had the
uniform, people just assumed things.

01:40:07.409 --> 01:40:11.903
I didn't correct them.
I guess I should've done.

01:40:13.148 --> 01:40:15.548
I guess you should've done.

01:40:17.286 --> 01:40:20.187
Katherine, look, I'm sorry, okay?

01:40:20.822 --> 01:40:22.847
I made a mistake.

01:40:23.025 --> 01:40:24.925
Just give me a chance...

01:40:25.093 --> 01:40:27.618
...to straighten things out, okay?

01:40:30.899 --> 01:40:33.697
Why couldn't you just be honest?

01:40:36.471 --> 01:40:38.564
You don't make it easy.

01:40:40.742 --> 01:40:42.607
You're so perfect, you...

01:40:44.713 --> 01:40:47.739
It's impossible to be honest
with you. I...

01:40:48.850 --> 01:40:50.943
For you, it is.

01:40:54.122 --> 01:40:58.183
Well, it's not just me, Katherine.
Joan failed you too, right?

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:01.761
- That's an awful thing to say.
- I know, but it's the truth.

01:41:03.065 --> 01:41:05.863
If you want honesty,
I can be real honest.

01:41:06.068 --> 01:41:09.060
You didn't come to Wellesley
to help people find their way.

01:41:09.237 --> 01:41:12.764
I think you came to help people
find your way.

01:41:37.399 --> 01:41:40.835
I'm not accustomed
to hunting you down.

01:41:42.804 --> 01:41:45.364
Elizabeth, look at me, please.

01:41:49.978 --> 01:41:52.970
I've spoken with Mrs. Jones.
There will be no divorce.

01:41:54.249 --> 01:41:57.446
There's always a period
of adjustment.

01:41:57.619 --> 01:42:01.453
I've assured her that you will try
for a year.

01:42:04.026 --> 01:42:06.324
Look at this, Mother.

01:42:11.166 --> 01:42:13.361
Spencer will try as well.

01:42:13.535 --> 01:42:17.733
According to her, he's really
very upset. You should call him.

01:42:17.906 --> 01:42:21.865
She's smiling. Is she happy?

01:42:23.278 --> 01:42:27.112
The important thing
is not to tell anyone.

01:42:27.282 --> 01:42:29.011
She looks happy.

01:42:29.551 --> 01:42:31.883
So, what does it matter?

01:42:32.554 --> 01:42:36.888
Don't wash your dirty laundry
in public.

01:42:37.192 --> 01:42:39.820
Let me tell you something.

01:42:41.096 --> 01:42:44.554
Not everything is as it seems.

01:43:03.785 --> 01:43:06.310
Dear Miss Watson:

01:43:06.488 --> 01:43:08.649
It is with great pleasure...

01:43:08.824 --> 01:43:11.019
...that we invite you...

01:43:11.193 --> 01:43:14.651
...to return as an instructor...

01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:17.162
...in the Art History department...

01:43:17.332 --> 01:43:22.964
...for the 1954-1955
academic year.

01:43:23.138 --> 01:43:28.007
We do wish to make clear, however,
that this invitation...

01:43:28.176 --> 01:43:33.637
...is absolutely conditional
upon the following:

01:43:35.183 --> 01:43:37.378
Please, Nora, may we continue?

01:43:37.552 --> 01:43:39.645
Number one:

01:43:40.155 --> 01:43:45.388
You will teach only the syllabus
as outlined by the department chair.

01:43:46.328 --> 01:43:48.023
Number two:

01:43:48.196 --> 01:43:50.096
All lesson plans...

01:43:50.265 --> 01:43:55.532
...must be submitted at the beginning
of every term for approval...

01:43:55.704 --> 01:43:57.831
...and revision.

01:43:58.006 --> 01:43:59.371
Number three:

01:43:59.541 --> 01:44:03.637
You shall not provide counsel
beyond your own subject...

01:44:03.812 --> 01:44:06.838
...for any student at any time.

01:44:07.015 --> 01:44:08.642
And finally:

01:44:08.817 --> 01:44:14.153
That you will agree to maintain
a strictly professional relationship...

01:44:14.322 --> 01:44:16.916
...with all members of the faculty.

01:44:17.092 --> 01:44:19.560
- Good evening, Katherine.
- Hi, Violet.

01:44:19.961 --> 01:44:24.125
Assuming you accept the conditions,
we look forward to your continuing...

01:44:24.299 --> 01:44:26.529
...to be a part
of our Wellesley tradition.

01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:37.710
Nice party.

01:44:37.879 --> 01:44:39.574
I didn't realize.

01:44:40.682 --> 01:44:42.513
It was a surprise.

01:44:42.717 --> 01:44:45.481
William H. Taft.
What does the letter H stand for?

01:44:45.654 --> 01:44:48.122
- Howard.
- Howard. Yes!

01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:50.721
Howard.

01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.651
Oh, it doesn't matter.

01:44:53.829 --> 01:44:57.697
The important thing is
that you'll be back next year.

01:44:57.866 --> 01:45:00.300
Hopefully living here.

01:45:03.338 --> 01:45:07.707
Well, I haven't really thought about
that. They just told me today.

01:45:09.611 --> 01:45:11.909
Well, there's still plenty of time.

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:15.306
You should be celebrating.

01:45:21.223 --> 01:45:22.952
You're right.

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:27.085
You're right. Let's celebrate.

01:45:30.398 --> 01:45:34.198
Let's go upstairs and get gussied up
and go out dancing.

01:45:36.538 --> 01:45:41.202
Silly, it's after 8:00.
Strike It Rich is on.

01:45:41.376 --> 01:45:45.369
- Life isn't about Strike It Rich.
- It's a school night.

01:45:45.547 --> 01:45:49.881
- So what?
- So I don't want to go. I'm happy here.

01:45:51.419 --> 01:45:52.716
It's back on.

01:45:56.191 --> 01:45:59.888
- Do you feel good about music...
- Oh, isn't he handsome?

01:46:01.463 --> 01:46:03.397
Watch with me.

01:46:05.133 --> 01:46:10.400
"You talked me into it," says this
oldie. What's the title of this one?

01:46:13.675 --> 01:46:15.768
"You Made Me Love You."

01:46:15.944 --> 01:46:19.641
"You Made Me Love..."
"You Made Me Love You."

01:46:23.718 --> 01:46:26.346
You get all that from looking
at paint on a canvas...

01:46:26.521 --> 01:46:29.251
...and it's her facial expression...

01:46:29.424 --> 01:46:31.551
...her eyes that makes
you think that.

01:46:31.726 --> 01:46:35.492
- I think that makes it interesting.
- The context that it comes from...

01:46:35.664 --> 01:46:37.188
...affects the way we view it.

01:46:37.365 --> 01:46:40.459
I think it provokes us because
it provoked the painter...

01:46:40.635 --> 01:46:44.002
...and in turn, he's kind of sending
that message to us.

01:46:44.172 --> 01:46:47.733
Whether or not it's a good painting
cannot be subjective.

01:46:47.909 --> 01:46:50.673
I feel like I'm missing something.

01:47:43.698 --> 01:47:45.757
It was Joan's idea.

01:47:50.305 --> 01:47:52.364
How else will you remember us?

01:48:35.617 --> 01:48:38.677
- They've invited you back.
- Do you think they made a mistake?

01:48:38.853 --> 01:48:40.286
I do.

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:49.292
- Elizabeth, I don't see Spencer.
- Excuse me, Mother.

01:48:49.464 --> 01:48:52.865
Miss Watson, can you help me
get in touch with your friend...

01:48:53.034 --> 01:48:54.296
...in Greenwich Village?

01:48:54.469 --> 01:48:56.903
What do you need
in Greenwich Village?

01:48:57.072 --> 01:48:58.471
An apartment.

01:48:59.974 --> 01:49:02.943
I filed for a divorce this morning.

01:49:04.179 --> 01:49:07.273
And since we know
I'm not welcome at your house...

01:49:08.983 --> 01:49:13.147
You remember Giselle Levy?
What did you call her?

01:49:14.055 --> 01:49:16.523
"A New York kike." That's it.

01:49:17.192 --> 01:49:19.990
Well, we're going to be roommates.

01:49:21.096 --> 01:49:22.859
Hi.

01:49:23.031 --> 01:49:26.523
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:49:39.114 --> 01:49:40.911
You okay?

01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:45.852
- Greenwich Village?
- Yeah. For a while.

01:49:46.654 --> 01:49:48.884
Then, who knows?

01:49:49.057 --> 01:49:52.356
Maybe law school. Yale, even.

01:49:54.596 --> 01:49:56.393
Well...

01:49:57.065 --> 01:50:01.627
...I wouldn't want to come up against
you in any court anywhere.

01:50:01.803 --> 01:50:04.499
Maybe I can drop by next year?

01:50:04.672 --> 01:50:06.970
Keep you on your toes.

01:50:09.077 --> 01:50:11.170
You will be here?

01:50:11.946 --> 01:50:13.937
Miss Watson?

01:50:20.021 --> 01:50:21.921
Dear Betty:

01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:26.959
I came to Wellesley because
I wanted to make a difference.

01:50:27.529 --> 01:50:29.224
But to change for others...

01:50:29.397 --> 01:50:31.558
- is to lie to yourself.

01:50:31.733 --> 01:50:33.030
My teacher...

01:50:33.201 --> 01:50:36.568
...Katherine Watson,
lived by her own definition...

01:50:36.738 --> 01:50:39.002
...and would not compromise that.

01:50:39.174 --> 01:50:41.870
Not even for Wellesley.

01:50:42.510 --> 01:50:45.343
I dedicate this, my last editorial...

01:50:45.513 --> 01:50:47.481
...to an extraordinary woman...

01:50:47.649 --> 01:50:49.549
...who lived by example...

01:50:49.717 --> 01:50:53.744
...and compelled us all to see
the world through new eyes.

01:50:54.989 --> 01:50:58.857
By the time you read this,
she'll be sailing to Europe...

01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:01.928
...where I know she'll find new walls
to break down...

01:51:02.096 --> 01:51:04.064
...and new ideas
to replace them with.

01:51:04.232 --> 01:51:06.325
Hold it, everybody.

01:51:12.173 --> 01:51:14.471
I've heard her called a quitter
for leaving...

01:51:14.642 --> 01:51:17.110
...an aimless wanderer.

01:51:17.278 --> 01:51:21.476
But not all who wander are aimless.

01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:26.143
Especially not those who seek truth
beyond tradition...

01:51:28.156 --> 01:51:30.386
...beyond definition...

01:51:33.094 --> 01:51:35.153
...beyond the image.

01:51:35.597 --> 01:51:38.088
Get the hell out of the way!

01:51:47.609 --> 01:51:49.804
I'll never forget you.

01:51:55.083 --> 01:51:59.315
Betty! Betty!

01:52:29.017 --> 01:52:30.644
What about after this war, Lee?

01:52:30.818 --> 01:52:33.582
Well, this job belongs
to some soldier.

01:52:33.755 --> 01:52:35.017
When he comes back...

01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:37.623
...he can have it.
- Oh, that's swell.
