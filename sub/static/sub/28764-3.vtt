WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:03.873
Previously on "Claws"...

00:03.916 --> 00:05.440
We assumed you'd be
a silent partner.

00:05.483 --> 00:06.658
Desna don't do silent.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.007
Joe!

00:08.051 --> 00:10.053
Joe runs the logistics
of our day-to-day here.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.837
Y'all are gonna love
working with us.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.014
EJ got out of prison and now
he wants to see Brienne.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.624
- Come on!
- Stop!

00:15.667 --> 00:18.061
Maybe I'll ask for sole custody, huh?
We will never let you.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.430
We ain't giving scripts
willy-nilly

00:19.454 --> 00:20.281
to pillbillies anymore.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.717
You mean you want to rehab,

00:21.760 --> 00:23.675
not a "rehab."

00:23.719 --> 00:25.827
I'm here for you and I got your
back, but I don't want to do this.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.810
D, I've changed.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.420
Prove it.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.442
The governor is laundering money
through the damn casino.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.816
That's what Penelope has
on Mac and Melba.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.557
I'm your only way out of this.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.776
Tell Desna I owe her.

00:37.820 --> 00:38.821
What's up, Penelope?

00:38.864 --> 00:40.692
The governor is takin' bribes

00:40.736 --> 00:42.651
for something
he's building. From who?

00:42.694 --> 00:44.000
We gon' find out,

00:44.044 --> 00:45.480
and we gon' use it
to our advantage.

00:45.523 --> 00:46.655
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:46.698 --> 00:49.962
We are gonna run Florida.

00:51.660 --> 00:55.316

these kids' ass, I will.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.184
Rough night?

01:37.227 --> 01:38.663
The worst. All right, time's up.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.337
Y'all eat your breakfast
before your godmother

01:40.361 --> 01:41.840
goes Mayweather on your butts.

01:41.884 --> 01:42.928
That is enough.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.408
You heard your mama.
Now eat it up.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.292
Hey, we got to hurry.
The lawyer's coming soon.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.327
What's all of this?

01:50.371 --> 01:52.373
It's fried bologna
with Jack Daniel's for my lady.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.636
Oh, you doing the most. Yes, I am.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.855
Jennifer!

01:56.899 --> 01:58.596
Okay, alright, get dressed!

01:58.640 --> 02:00.183
Come on, go get dressed.
You get the big one.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.575
- You get the big one.
- Come on, big one!

02:01.599 --> 02:03.862
I can't be livin' up
in no flop house!

02:03.906 --> 02:05.864
We are your parents! Damn!

02:05.908 --> 02:07.823
I need to find me a place,
like, yesterday.

02:07.866 --> 02:09.128
I tried to tell you,

02:09.172 --> 02:10.541
you and me get
a place together, but...

02:10.565 --> 02:12.523
And I told you
we should go slow.

02:12.567 --> 02:15.831
Remember I said that? Oh, I heard you.
But you were wrong.

02:15.874 --> 02:19.139
Okay, well, it's gonna take
a lot more than whiskey meat

02:19.182 --> 02:21.402
for me to trust your ass. You think so?

02:21.445 --> 02:23.491
I know you love
that whiskey meat.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.016
Oh, shit!

02:27.059 --> 02:28.626
Goddamn.

02:28.670 --> 02:29.845
That's it!

02:36.982 --> 02:38.593
So, um, what are our options?

02:38.636 --> 02:41.161
Since EJ never terminated his
parental rights to Brienne...

02:41.204 --> 02:42.858
Whoa, whoa. Wait, what rights?

02:42.901 --> 02:44.251
He is basically a sperm donor,

02:44.294 --> 02:46.035
and they've
never even met. Whoa!

02:46.078 --> 02:48.820
How many times you've been arrested...
What are numbers, really?

02:48.864 --> 02:50.909
It's a concept.Exactly.
Thank you, baby.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.215
So the important part

02:52.259 --> 02:54.086
is that I've never
actually been locked up.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.871
I'm sorry,
does that say "crack?"

02:55.914 --> 02:57.481
So we all have a history.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.309
Does EJ have a case or not?

02:59.353 --> 03:01.137
For sole custody, unlikely,

03:01.181 --> 03:03.183
but he probably
can get joint custody,

03:03.226 --> 03:05.054
unless
you want to fight him. We do.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.796
We don't want EJ
anywhere near Brienne.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.364
Right?

03:10.407 --> 03:11.800
Right?

03:11.843 --> 03:13.584
Oh, Christ on a bike, Bryce.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.673
We... We do not want EJ
in Brienne's life.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.632
I'm just saying,
imagine if you told me

03:17.675 --> 03:19.677
I couldn't see
either of the girls again.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.264
Oh, you're gonna do
this bullshit right now?

03:21.288 --> 03:22.724
Can we have a minute?

03:22.767 --> 03:23.986
Sure.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.901
Paid by the hour.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:36.781 --> 03:38.716
You are her father.
You are the one who raised her.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.152
You are the one who was there
for her whole life!

03:40.176 --> 03:41.656
But the law says I'm not.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.459
When we were separated,
I was scared shitless

03:43.484 --> 03:45.288
you'd take Brienne from me.
I would never do that!

03:45.312 --> 03:46.965
But you could have!

03:47.009 --> 03:49.925
I guess I'm just trying to
put myself in EJ's shoes here.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.667
Those two deserve a chance
to get to know each other,

03:52.710 --> 03:54.669
and I won't
get in the way of that.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.890
I went through enough shit
losing my own parents.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.459
You get my text?

04:02.503 --> 04:03.721
I did.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.027
You want hardwood floors,

04:05.070 --> 04:07.203
an all-white kitchen,
and you can't be

04:07.247 --> 04:09.616
the only black person
in the building? The only black person.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.685
That part.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.513
What if there is
a black doorman?

04:12.556 --> 04:14.297
Does that count? Nope.

04:14.341 --> 04:19.128
Then that's a no
and that one's gone.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.565
Aww, goodbye to the penthouse.

04:21.608 --> 04:24.481
You know what, there are
so many listings on Zillow.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.831
We're gonna
find you something.Good.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.398
Let's do this.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.966
♪ Whoo

04:31.009 --> 04:32.184
♪ Okay

04:42.543 --> 04:44.588
♪ I got this thing on lock

04:44.632 --> 04:45.937
♪ Everybody can't get enough

04:46.982 --> 04:49.985
Oh, my God!

04:50.028 --> 04:51.856

04:51.900 --> 04:53.075

04:55.817 --> 04:58.994
♪ Just watch me now
It's beautiful!

04:59.037 --> 05:02.084
Right? Gentle reminder...
It is above your budget.

05:02.127 --> 05:06.218
A boss doesn't have a budget.

05:08.264 --> 05:11.963
I'll take it,
and everything in it.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.878
♪ Just watch me now

05:13.922 --> 05:16.620
I'll take it, I'll take it,
I'll take it, I'll take it,

05:16.664 --> 05:18.796
I'll take it, I'll take it,
I'll take it!

05:18.840 --> 05:22.017
I will take it!

05:22.060 --> 05:25.716
So if we leverage
the infrastructure,

05:25.760 --> 05:30.112
we'd have much stronger
horizontal integration.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.636
Would we?

05:32.680 --> 05:34.029
Oh, we would.

05:36.074 --> 05:39.556
I got to take this. This is Joe.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.690
He dropped his pants
at the blackjack table again?

05:42.733 --> 05:46.084
Okay, I'll be right down.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.130
That dealer's always drunk, man.

05:48.173 --> 05:51.002
We need to drill down,
give him his notice.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.569
I'll recruit for his backfill.

05:52.613 --> 05:56.181
What? You want me
to workshop the issue?

05:56.225 --> 05:58.923
I want you to show me
the real Polly.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.360
You think that might happen?

06:00.403 --> 06:02.013
I'm gonna have
to get back to you

06:02.057 --> 06:03.058
on those deliverables.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.886
Well, don't take too long.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.765
Joe Dupree.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.680
Ah, yeah,
just calling to confirm

06:16.724 --> 06:18.639
the Lovestones' 7:00 p.m. pickup

06:18.682 --> 06:20.728
for the Governor's
fundraiser. Uh, yeah, right.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.947
And, uh, drop-off
is where, again?

06:22.991 --> 06:25.036
223 Oak Street.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.603
Thank you.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.739
This is Desna. Leave a message.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.176
Desna, it's me.
I got a juicy tidbit.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.831
The Governor is having
a little shindig tonight,

06:36.874 --> 06:39.007
and Mac and Melba
are gonna be there.

06:39.050 --> 06:42.053
I thought we could sneak in,
do a little snoopin'.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.142
Polly Bird.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.405
Call me back.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.319
What's happening, Polly Bird?

06:47.363 --> 06:49.060
What's up, Roller? I'm working.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.976
Hey, I need a little help
with Desna.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.326
I'm trying to get with her, you know?
For real, for real.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.590
You mean, for real,
like the Obamas,

06:56.633 --> 06:57.852
or for real,

06:57.895 --> 07:00.115
like Diane Von Furstenberg
and Barry Diller?

07:00.158 --> 07:01.377
Come on, Polly.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.789
I don't know
what you talkin' about.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.206
She thinks I haven't changed.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.401
I want to prove to her
I'm a changed man.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.470
Oh! Yeah.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.211
Okay.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.908
Well, first of all,

07:10.952 --> 07:12.780
you could learn to use a button.

07:12.823 --> 07:15.043
Baby, buttons are for gluttons.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.697
Polly, come on.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.501
What's that have to do
with me being a better person?

07:18.525 --> 07:20.483
My clothes? Come on. Yes, your clothes.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.311
Clothes are everything, Roller.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.182
They show
that you care about her,

07:24.226 --> 07:25.508
that this is
a serious relationship

07:25.532 --> 07:27.359
and not, you know,
"You know what I'm sayin'?

07:27.403 --> 07:28.883
The Players Ball."

07:28.926 --> 07:30.058
Women don't like that.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.103
I'm all ears, baby.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.149
Okay.

Is that an infinity pool?
True or false.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.581
About damn time
you got a new place, girl.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.234
Are you sure you can afford it?

08:16.278 --> 08:18.323
Okay, you can see it.
Now you got opinions.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.803
I'm just saying.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.675
I set those casino bitches
straight.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.111
Ain't no way
they're gonna play me.

08:23.154 --> 08:26.157
And now, I'm living the life
I deserve.

08:26.201 --> 08:27.289
Okurr?

08:27.332 --> 08:29.334
Oh, Des, you bougie now.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.553
We all gonna be bougie.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.294
Got a right to be.

08:32.337 --> 08:33.337
Bougie ass.

08:33.381 --> 08:34.818
Allow me to make a contribution.

08:34.861 --> 08:36.404
I'll be your pool man
if you let me use your pool.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.995
- Hell, yeah!
- Unh-unh.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.345
Don't let Ann do it.
And don't let Virginia do it.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.695
That's what I'm sayin'.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.087
Oh, my God.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.439
Shit!

08:47.483 --> 08:49.354
Geez! Oh, God!

08:49.398 --> 08:52.270
Oh, my God. That's Penelope.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.670
Oh, my God.
This is all my fault.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.412
- No, no, no, Des. No.
- This is so messed up.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.501
Mac and Melba did this
as a warning.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.504
If I would have minded
my own damn business,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.941
this girl would still be alive.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.290
I got her killed!

09:12.334 --> 09:13.485
Jenn, go get Bryce!
He can help us!

09:13.509 --> 09:15.293
No! I do not want him involved.
Shh!

09:15.337 --> 09:17.252
Oh, shit. She... She... She...

09:17.295 --> 09:19.384
She was pregnant! Maybe we should pray.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.169
- We don't have time for that!
- Shut up!

09:21.212 --> 09:22.668
Mrs. Schreckler's
coming in any minute!

09:22.692 --> 09:24.389
Shh! I can't think!

09:24.433 --> 09:25.889
All right, all right,
all right, all right. I cannot think.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.263
I don't know what
we're about to do right now.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.613
Breathe. Breathe.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.136
EVERYBODY, BREATHE.JENNIFER: Okay.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.616
Oh, shit. Okay. Okay, okay.

09:33.660 --> 09:36.358
First thing we got to do
is get this girl out of here.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.752
Uh, I'll... I'll pull the van
up... up to the back.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.537
And lock the door!
You go get some towels.Yes.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.148
Find me something
to wrap this girl up with.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.107
Hurry up, Jennifer!

09:47.282 --> 09:49.284
Shit.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.373
I feel good
ABOUT THIS DAY, BOY.BRYCE: Me, too.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.264
Oh, here we go. Here we go, here we go.
Come on, now!

09:53.288 --> 09:54.898
They look like
they need some rehab.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.291
We're open! Come on in!

09:56.334 --> 09:57.964
They could definitely use some
rehab right there.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.251
Right. Look at her.
Hey, we could help you heal.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.079
Damn.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.211
I knew this rehab thing

10:03.254 --> 10:04.734
was gonna be harder
than I thought,

10:04.778 --> 10:06.301
but I mean,
I knew we'd take a hit

10:06.344 --> 10:07.998
when we shifted gears,
you know, but...

10:08.042 --> 10:11.175
Yeah, ever since you stopped
handing out Oxy like Tic-Tacs,

10:11.219 --> 10:13.395
some kind of mass
migration took place.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.136
I know where they went.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.312
I just drove past
the Peter Pain Clinic,

10:17.355 --> 10:19.357
and they stole
all of our pillbillies.

10:19.401 --> 10:24.536
Boys, we gonna do us
some recruitin'.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.104
Hurry up, before clients
start coming in. Okay, okay.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.629
The van's in the alley. Okay, come on,
let's do it.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.066
1, 2, 3!

10:33.763 --> 10:35.243
Damn!
Muscle does weigh more than fat.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.114
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.725
Oh, shit. Oh, no.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.573
Oh, my God, please don't let
this be how this ends.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.836
We cannot have popo
sniffin' around, y'all. Pull it together!

10:43.860 --> 10:45.383
I'll handle it!

10:45.427 --> 10:46.558
Okay.

10:46.602 --> 10:47.864
Oh, shit!

10:49.213 --> 10:50.613
- Great.
- Ann's the strong one. No!

10:54.044 --> 10:55.263
Hey.

10:55.306 --> 10:57.308
You won't answer my texts.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.701
Can we not do this right now?

10:58.745 --> 11:00.921
Well, when's good? At boxing?

11:00.964 --> 11:02.923
Look... You only want
to see me in the ring?

11:02.966 --> 11:05.447
I just got a lot of stuff
going on right now, okay?

11:05.490 --> 11:07.231
You hiding something?

11:07.275 --> 11:10.104
Look, why can't you just
get it through your head

11:10.147 --> 11:11.540
that you and I are over?

11:11.583 --> 11:13.324
Fine.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.935
I'm getting off crazy train...

11:14.978 --> 11:16.545
Good! ...For good.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.769
- Push!
- To the right, to the right.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.076
She's in, she's in,
she's in, she's in. Okay.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.992
Go get some bleach,
finishing cleaning up the blood,

11:29.036 --> 11:30.254
and then open the salon.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.169
It is business as usual.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.389
I'll take care of Penelope.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.001
What are you gonna do?

11:38.045 --> 11:39.481
The less y'all know, the better.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.700
Okay? Just go!

11:40.743 --> 11:42.049
That was close.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.548
Your silk wrap is parking!
Jennifer: Oh, shit.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.139
All right, come on.
Let's do this.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.401
No, no, no.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.465
You stay here
and help the girls inside.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.317
What?
What are you talking about?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.188
This is my shit, Ann!

11:51.232 --> 11:52.581
I got it.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.670
This just got so real, Des.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.343
Are you sure the casino
is worth all this?

11:56.367 --> 11:57.717
Penelope died because of us!

11:57.760 --> 11:59.651
We're not letting Mac and Melba
get away with it.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.677
Go.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.244
Go!

12:05.376 --> 12:07.378
Shit.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.567
Where your girl at?
I'm only doing this for you.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.004
I know, baby. Thank you.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.049
I know it's a huge risk.
She's fixing to come.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.616
There she is.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.147
Hey, Lady Di,
you remember Desna.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.540
She used to visit me in lock-up.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.411
Of course.
Nice to see you again.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.326
In the back.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.640
Shit!

12:56.645 --> 12:58.821
Thank you.

12:58.865 --> 12:59.996
I never seen nothing.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.215
You're the best.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.870
Mm, thank you.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.396
Hey.

13:08.439 --> 13:12.182
What's going on?

13:12.226 --> 13:14.358
I'm messing up, Pol.

13:14.402 --> 13:17.057
My gut is off.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.321
I mean, look at...
Look at all that happened

13:20.364 --> 13:22.584
with Zlata
and that lean in bullshit.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.848
And then somebody dropped
a casino right in my lap,

13:25.892 --> 13:31.071
and I thought we was gonna
walk in there like queens.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.334
But this shit's just
falling down around me,

13:33.377 --> 13:36.250
and I...
I can't see my way out of it.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.512
Hey.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.775
You remember
when I had that meltdown

13:39.819 --> 13:42.517
at the Sarasota Kennel Club
Dog Racetrack?

13:42.560 --> 13:43.561
Remember that?

13:43.605 --> 13:45.346
I had lost all my money

13:45.389 --> 13:47.739
on an Italian Greyhound
named Ricardo.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.393
I was fixin' to kill myself.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.568
But you...

13:50.612 --> 13:53.006
You looked at me and you said,

13:53.049 --> 13:56.139
"Pol, I want you
to close your eyes,"

13:56.183 --> 13:57.575
and I want you to picture...

13:57.619 --> 13:59.316
a double rainbow."A double rainbow.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.927
Mm-hmm.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.798
You said the world
can't be all bad

14:02.842 --> 14:05.192
if God made something
as beautiful as that.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.806
Yeah.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.199
I was just saying that

14:12.242 --> 14:14.331
because I didn't want your ass
to jump off that roof.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.637
Well, it worked!

14:15.680 --> 14:19.249
Because every time
I'm in a sticky situation,

14:19.293 --> 14:20.642
I close my eyes

14:20.685 --> 14:22.600
and I just think about
that double rainbow.

14:22.644 --> 14:26.126
Or check your ass
into a mental institution.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.910
Well, they're both effective.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.259
The point is,

14:29.303 --> 14:31.914
you got to change
how you're looking at this.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.569
You're right.

14:34.612 --> 14:37.920
We got to get this cake
up on our terms.

14:37.964 --> 14:42.359
Because my black ass is not
living in Quiet Ann's van.

14:42.403 --> 14:43.970
Well, that's not gonna happen.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.754
Because you know why?

14:45.797 --> 14:49.018
Double rainbow.

14:49.062 --> 14:52.326
That part. Yeah.

14:53.370 --> 14:56.417
Okay. Okay.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.593
We go back,

14:58.636 --> 15:01.465
and we let these fools
think everything is fine.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.163
Mm-hmm.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.469
And then sneak attack. Love it.

15:10.561 --> 15:11.974
Now we show them
they not gon' scare us away.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.522
They gon' get the message. Loud and clear.

15:14.565 --> 15:15.915
So, what's the next play?

15:15.958 --> 15:18.091
Well, Penelope said
the Governor was taking bribes

15:18.134 --> 15:20.049
for something big
that he's building.

15:20.093 --> 15:24.184
So I'm thinking we just got
to find out what that is.

15:24.227 --> 15:27.404
Oh! They think they can keep
secrets from you, Desna.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.102
Bitch, we own a casino.

15:29.145 --> 15:32.453
Whatever monies Mac and Melba
are running up in through here,

15:32.496 --> 15:33.497
half of that is ours.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.804
Truth. Now, didn't you say

15:35.847 --> 15:37.825
that they were having
some shindig for the Governor?

15:37.849 --> 15:40.591
Yeah. Tonight. That's what
I'm talkin' about.

15:40.635 --> 15:41.984
We gon' crash that bitch

15:42.028 --> 15:45.335
and find out exactly
what they asses is hidin'.

15:46.989 --> 15:50.384
Excuse me.
Mac and Melba Lovestone?

15:50.427 --> 15:51.951
Yeah.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.345
Hey, thank you.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.391
Close the door
on your way out, huh?

16:02.091 --> 16:03.788
"I'm so sorry for your loss."

16:03.832 --> 16:06.008
I know how much
Penelope meant to you.

16:06.052 --> 16:09.620
"With deepest sympathy, Desna."

16:13.146 --> 16:16.627
Well, she did pick
a lovely arrangement.

16:18.673 --> 16:22.764
Kill Desna, kill her not,

16:22.807 --> 16:25.047
Kill Desna, kill her not, Kill Desna...
Remember what the therapist said

16:25.071 --> 16:27.203
about controlling
your emotion, Lamby.

16:27.247 --> 16:30.554
Besides, that would bring us
some unwanted attention

16:30.598 --> 16:31.816
from the Professor.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.384
I am tempted
to take that chance.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.083
She's gonna get
what's coming to her.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.655
Hey, baby, you remember
when Daddy Bryce

16:44.699 --> 16:47.019
married me after you born,
when your other daddy went away?

16:47.049 --> 16:47.789
Black Daddy.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.095
Yeah! Black Daddy.

16:49.138 --> 16:52.315
Well, uh, Black Daddy's out...
Uh, back.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.927
He is back, and...

16:55.971 --> 16:59.583
He would really love
to meet you,

16:59.627 --> 17:02.021
if that's something
you would be interested in.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.587
Does White Daddy know?

17:03.631 --> 17:04.719
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.286
We talked about it,

17:06.329 --> 17:09.332
and he thinks it's a great idea
for you to meet EJ.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.986
His name's EJ.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.817
Is that something
you think you want to do?

17:18.340 --> 17:19.386
Bree?

17:19.429 --> 17:20.909
Okay.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.693
Okay?

17:24.130 --> 17:27.698
- Breakfast burrito, chilled.
- I got you, girl.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.616
Cold takeout?

17:32.660 --> 17:34.183
I like my food cold.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.620
Is there something wrong
with that?

17:36.664 --> 17:37.665
Nothing, it's just...

17:37.708 --> 17:39.406
It's cute.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.845
Look, I'm not...
I'm not judging.

17:43.888 --> 17:44.846
I know.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.500
That's not who you are.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.198
I'm Eric.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.246
Virginia.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.466
Oh! I, uh...

17:56.510 --> 17:57.728
Got to go. Go.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.687
Yeah.

17:59.730 --> 18:00.818
Nice meeting you.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.184
♪ Tell me what it do, baby

18:29.804 --> 18:30.848
What it do, D?

18:30.892 --> 18:34.330
Apparently, it does a lot.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.289
You like?

18:36.332 --> 18:37.333
I like.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.769
Yeah, well,
I thought I'd come by

18:38.813 --> 18:39.770
and check in with you.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.598
Heard you got a lot going on, D.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.123
You okay? I will be.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.318
What if I take you to dinner,
take your mind off of it?

18:46.342 --> 18:48.823
Okay, hell has definitely
frozen over,

18:48.866 --> 18:51.130
and your ass
is ice-skating on it.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.871
Listen, if you want to miss
all this, fine by me.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.830
It's up to you.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.005
I'm busy tonight.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.659
I've got a fundraiser to go to.

18:58.702 --> 19:01.227
But you can come by my place
tomorrow night.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.359
Ooh! I get to see the new crib.

19:03.403 --> 19:06.710
I mean, seeing as how you went
through all the trouble...

19:06.754 --> 19:08.321
D.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.757
I'll be seeing you at 8:00.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.672
I'll pick you up.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.808
I'll be damned.

19:17.852 --> 19:20.071
Let's do some talkin'.

19:20.115 --> 19:24.946
All right, let's talk some sense
into these pillbillies.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.166
Shit, I recognize
that camo neck brace.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.210
Lloyd!

19:29.603 --> 19:31.605
What you doin' here?
I thought we had something.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.824
Eat shit, Clay!

19:33.868 --> 19:36.175
You ain't a dependable
businessman no more.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.481
Well, that's because I woke up,
Lloyd.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.743
Them days are gone.

19:39.787 --> 19:42.529
I intend to make amends

19:42.572 --> 19:46.794
for my personal contribution
to the opioid crisis.

19:46.837 --> 19:50.798
Take that do-gooder bullshit
some place else.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.017
Your kind ain't welcome here.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.629
I have, uh, some fliers for you.

19:55.672 --> 19:56.934
Get out of here!

19:58.632 --> 20:01.025
Okay. Oh! Shit.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.767
These animals
only respond to one thing.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.205
Compassion. Opiates, boo.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.250
You know, the big "O."

20:08.294 --> 20:10.513
O.C.? Roxie Carmichael?

20:10.557 --> 20:13.037
You guys want your crusty
son-of-a-guns back,

20:13.081 --> 20:14.778
you got to get them some candy,
and quick.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.258
For cheap, too.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.955
Goddamn,
we talked about this, boy.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.150
This...
That ain't the way anymore.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.263
Toby might be right.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.441
We tell them
we're selling shit half-price

20:25.485 --> 20:26.355
to lure them,

20:26.399 --> 20:28.096
and once they're at our place,

20:28.139 --> 20:30.229
we rehabilitate
their asses. Yeah!

20:30.272 --> 20:33.275
So we do
a little bit of bad... A little bit.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.364
But we reap
a hell of a lot of good.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.933
I like your thinkin', boy.

20:38.976 --> 20:41.457
Who here wants
half-priced drugs?

20:50.510 --> 20:52.642
Don't separate your tiles.

20:52.686 --> 20:53.904
It lets your opponents know

20:53.948 --> 20:55.950
when you're about ready
to make a hand.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.865
It's... Pardon me?

20:57.908 --> 21:01.303
Mahjong is a game
of extreme skill and strategy.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.871
I think you got the potential
to really excel at it.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.047
I could teach you...

21:07.091 --> 21:09.833
Uh, is that a sexual advance?

21:09.877 --> 21:11.008
I'm engaged.

21:11.052 --> 21:13.228
No, I... I'm not hitting on you.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.274
Mac Lovestone.
I'm an owner here.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.320
Dean Simms.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.322
My sister Desna is an owner,
too.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.107
Prolonged eye contact
makes me uneasy.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.326
Not as much as owls

21:24.370 --> 21:26.459
or commercially distressed
jeans.

21:26.502 --> 21:27.982
Deanie? Oh, hey, Des.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.418
Baby, I wasn't expecting you.

21:29.462 --> 21:30.898
Oh, I'm just talking to Mac.

21:30.941 --> 21:31.855
He knows a lot about Mahjong.

21:31.899 --> 21:35.032
I'm sure he kills it.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.904
Can I talk to him alone?

21:36.947 --> 21:38.471
You don't mind, do you?

21:40.124 --> 21:42.910
Dean, look at me. Yeah.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.912
I want you
to stay away from him.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.479
Why? He seems very nice.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.916
And male companionship is
something I'm sorely lacking.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.832
Dean, he's dangerous.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.224
All right?

21:53.268 --> 21:55.618
I want you to go home,
and I'm not playing with you.

21:55.662 --> 21:56.619
Right now.

21:56.663 --> 21:59.796
But, Des, I... What did I say?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.058
Now.

22:01.102 --> 22:04.410
I thought you said
I needed a new purpose.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.855
We are here
for the Governor's party.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.073
Phones.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.670
This does not sound like
a fundraiser for the Governor.

22:22.471 --> 22:23.864
Damn!

22:26.823 --> 22:28.085
What the...

22:29.348 --> 22:30.958
Oh.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.917
Ooh! I love a masquerade ball.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.050
Thank you.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.187
Oh.

22:43.231 --> 22:45.712
It's thatkind of party.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.858
- You're bad.
- Oh, so bad.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.654
Leave it to the Republicans

23:14.697 --> 23:16.046
to do some freaky shit
with pigs.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.657
Y'all, remember why we are here

23:17.700 --> 23:19.572
and stick to the plan,
ladies, okay?

23:19.615 --> 23:22.052
Find out what the Governor's
building and who's bribing him.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.967
Let's do it for Penelope, y'all.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.142
Yeah, for Penelope.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.363
Shit.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.453
I know that limp.
That clown is Governor Patel.

23:31.497 --> 23:35.152
If we gon' get into that room
where he is,

23:35.196 --> 23:37.154
we gon' have to shed
our inhibitions.

23:37.198 --> 23:39.026
All right. Let's go. Come on.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.745
Now, what would you say
if I told you

23:42.769 --> 23:45.641
that in six months,
you could be drug-free

23:45.685 --> 23:50.124
and living a life
driven by your intentions?

23:50.167 --> 23:51.604
Wait, now how's that gonna work

23:51.647 --> 23:53.954
if the State of Florida
confiscated my driver's license?

23:53.997 --> 23:55.018
- Yeah!
- Hey, now, Listen.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.478
Listen, listen now!

23:56.522 --> 23:57.760
There ain't nothin'
that can be overcome.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.612
Y'all just need
to see the light.

23:59.655 --> 24:03.354
I believe I was brought here
under false pretentiousness.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.705
Where's the half-price
generic roxie I was promised?

24:05.748 --> 24:07.054
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

24:07.097 --> 24:08.161
Come on, now! Calm down, folks.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.249
This isn't how we heal,
all right?

24:09.273 --> 24:10.294
We're trying to heal y'all!

24:10.318 --> 24:11.493
Yeah, you know what?

24:11.537 --> 24:13.016
No, forget this. Come on, y'all.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.017
Let's go back to Peter Pain.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.497
- Yeah!
- No, no, no, no, no!

24:15.541 --> 24:17.456
We're trying to heal y'all,
make you better now!

24:17.499 --> 24:19.588
Whew, these bring me back.

24:19.632 --> 24:20.807
Mm, mm, mm.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.157
Does this stupid thing
look like the picture?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.854
Yas, kween!

24:24.898 --> 24:27.857
Did Goldtouch get the bid?

24:27.901 --> 24:29.163
We're about to find out.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.034
I'm gonna meet Trip now.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.780
Good luck getting that contract.

24:48.225 --> 24:50.053
Want to play?

24:50.097 --> 24:52.708
In here? Sure.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.362
Why not, sugar?

24:54.405 --> 24:55.624
Mmm.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.323
We're gonna have
a private party.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.543
Mmm.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.297
You not gonna make that meeting.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.603
I'll be repping Goldtouch.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.575
Thank you.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.146
Damn.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.191
I thought we knew how to party.

25:44.325 --> 25:48.068
Welcome, you beautiful freaks!

25:48.111 --> 25:50.897
Of course these psychos
would be running the show.

25:50.940 --> 25:55.292
As always, tonight,
we pick one lucky guest

25:55.336 --> 25:57.251
to bless the festivities!

25:58.208 --> 26:01.255
You. You're the sacrifice.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.562
Me? Did he say me?

26:04.780 --> 26:06.260
You have been chosen.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.020
No, no, no, no.
You... you want me to take him?

26:08.044 --> 26:09.089
I'll... No, no, no.

26:13.484 --> 26:16.792
We now welcome the Executioner.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.489
What the hell are they doing?

26:18.533 --> 26:21.231
Executioner, are you prepared
to do your duty?

26:21.275 --> 26:22.885
I am, Master.

26:26.846 --> 26:29.065
Joe? Joe, it's me.

26:29.109 --> 26:30.545
It's your cohort, Polly.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.808
Silence!

26:35.115 --> 26:36.725
Proceed.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.162
Shit.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.077
♪ Relax, don't do it

26:41.121 --> 26:43.993
♪ When you want to go to it

26:44.037 --> 26:45.647
♪ Relax, don't do it

26:45.691 --> 26:47.301
♪ When you want to come Oh, my God.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.303
These people are batshit.

26:51.392 --> 26:52.698
There goes the Governor.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.743
Let's split up.
Ann, you watch our backs.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.919
♪ When you want to come Okay.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.967
♪ When you want to come

27:05.362 --> 27:07.277
The Governor picks you.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.203
Ah!

27:45.751 --> 27:47.511
- Thank you for your work.
- You're an inspiration.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.015
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.456
You got some business with him?

27:55.499 --> 27:59.460
I'm from Goldtouch.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.418
Please tell me
you're my midnight meeting.

28:01.462 --> 28:05.379
Is there some place we can talk?

28:06.685 --> 28:07.860
Ahh!

28:08.556 --> 28:10.036
Polly. Hmm?

28:11.385 --> 28:13.169
I met a cute boy today.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.780
You did? Yeah!

28:14.823 --> 28:16.477
Why are we here?
What are we doing?

28:16.520 --> 28:17.783
We're trying to find out

28:17.826 --> 28:19.064
what the Governor and Mac
and Melba are up to

28:19.088 --> 28:21.003
and why they keep trying
to cut Desna out.

28:21.047 --> 28:21.830
Mwah! Mwah!

28:21.874 --> 28:22.831
I love you!

28:22.875 --> 28:24.398
I love you! Love you.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.446
How about

28:29.490 --> 28:31.274
we talk a little business?

28:41.371 --> 28:43.504
Glad you're into this.

28:44.984 --> 28:48.639
That's why I'm giving Goldtouch
the contract.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.731
Oh, shit.

29:01.348 --> 29:03.567
Go ahead.

29:03.611 --> 29:06.440
Work your magic.

29:09.573 --> 29:13.403
Ready, baby? Oh, yeah.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.101
Oh!

29:16.580 --> 29:19.670
Oh, I love what y'all did
with your last project.

29:19.714 --> 29:22.761
Well, I mean, which one?

29:22.804 --> 29:24.414
I mean, Goldtouch does so many.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.548
Alameda Corrections in Texas.

29:27.591 --> 29:30.420
Yeah.

29:30.464 --> 29:33.032
You know what they say.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.555
"Don't mess with Texas."

29:34.598 --> 29:36.426
The big house is big business.

29:36.470 --> 29:40.822
Oh, especially
when it's private prisons!

29:40.866 --> 29:42.345
Oh, mama!

29:46.828 --> 29:49.657
All right. Your turn.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.572
I'mma hold off for right now.

29:51.615 --> 29:52.616
I'm actually okay.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.575
Oh, come on, now.

29:54.618 --> 29:57.578
It's... It's give-and-get,
gorgeous.

29:57.621 --> 29:58.927
Yeah, well, you know,

29:58.971 --> 30:01.408
I like to take a little time
to get worked up.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.804
Hey, you bring my money?

30:05.847 --> 30:08.328
You know I got your money, baby.

30:08.371 --> 30:12.332
I'mma go get it for you
right now.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.030
Don't move.

30:15.074 --> 30:17.076
I ain't gonna move an inch.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.515
I like her.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.129
Ma chère!

31:17.745 --> 31:20.661
The Governor thanks you.

31:20.704 --> 31:24.621
How'd you hear about this?

31:24.665 --> 31:27.059
Oh, I have my ways. Do you, now?

31:27.102 --> 31:29.626
Uh-huh. I'm full of surprises.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.019
Like, uh...

31:31.063 --> 31:33.456
Like the two stints
that I did in the nuthouse.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.936
But I've never felt better.

31:34.980 --> 31:38.679
You said you wanted to see
the real Polly.

31:38.722 --> 31:40.420
Here she is.

31:41.769 --> 31:45.338
Speaking of crazy,
that was quite, quite a gift

31:45.381 --> 31:49.516
that your bosses left
in our salon, mister.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.015
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.214
Oh, I think you...

31:52.258 --> 31:53.520
No, I don't want to go!

32:08.752 --> 32:09.928
I see you.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.712
Oh, you think you special?

32:11.755 --> 32:13.670
Why... why are you being
so mean to me?

32:13.714 --> 32:15.803
I... I thought pigs were
supposed to be nice.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.196
Where'd you get that?

32:17.239 --> 32:18.608
That's some
"Charlotte's Web" bullshit.

32:18.632 --> 32:19.807
Can I give you a hug?

32:19.850 --> 32:21.852
Put on some damn clothes.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.290
What?

32:25.682 --> 32:27.467
Au revoir ma chérie.

32:27.510 --> 32:28.642
Au revoir ma chérie.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.170
Get in here.
Who... Who was that?

32:35.214 --> 32:39.740
He is from Greater Sarasota
Power and Electric.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.481
I saw him make a payment.

32:41.524 --> 32:43.613
Okay, well, check this out.

32:43.657 --> 32:46.616
The Governor thought I was the
woman from Goldtouch Development.

32:46.660 --> 32:50.011
Apparently, contractors
have been paying him off

32:50.055 --> 32:51.926
to build private prisons.

32:51.970 --> 32:56.148
Oh! So this is where
the Governor gets his bribes!

32:56.191 --> 32:58.454
No wonder Mac and Melba
are cutting you out!

32:58.498 --> 33:00.500
This deal's worth millions!
Yeah!

33:00.543 --> 33:03.198
They're making a lot of money
lockin' up people like us.

33:03.242 --> 33:07.594
Imagine the shit everyone here
would be in if this popped!

33:07.637 --> 33:09.378
That's why they killed Penelope.

33:09.422 --> 33:10.466
She ran her damn mouth.

33:10.510 --> 33:11.598
Oh, wait!

33:11.641 --> 33:13.382
Now that sounds like leverage.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.384
And we gon' secure the bag.

33:15.428 --> 33:16.559
Where's Virginia?

33:16.603 --> 33:17.952
What is wrong with y'all?

33:17.996 --> 33:19.171
Stop touching each other!

33:19.214 --> 33:21.521
Unh-unh. Unh, unh, unh! Hey!

33:21.564 --> 33:23.001
What are y'all on?

33:23.044 --> 33:25.133
Don't start rubbing me! You're shiny!

33:25.177 --> 33:26.787
Wait! Let's go. Come on.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.008
- Okay.
- I love y'all so much!

33:33.141 --> 33:34.403
I know you a liar. Wait, wait.

33:34.447 --> 33:38.146
You shocked the Governor
in his balls?

33:38.190 --> 33:40.757
Okay, trust,
it was for a good cause.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.759
No, no, no. I'm telling y'all.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.457
Listen, we got to dream bigger.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.763
I mean, beyond the salon
and franchising it.

33:46.807 --> 33:49.070
There's a lot of shit
we could be doing.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.680
- You...
- All right.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.769
You giving me real orange vibes.

33:52.813 --> 33:55.598
There's been a shift
in your sexual aura.

33:55.642 --> 33:56.730
Ooh!

33:56.773 --> 33:58.166
Is this your eye power thing?

33:58.210 --> 33:59.428
Yeah, girl. I can see it.

33:59.472 --> 34:00.734
She ain't got no damn power.

34:00.777 --> 34:03.693
She's not wrong.
I did it with a dude last night.

34:03.737 --> 34:06.740
- I know you lyin'!
- I knew I smelled cock.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.697
Wait, he had a penis
and everything?

34:08.742 --> 34:10.178
Why do I miss
all the good parties?

34:10.222 --> 34:11.851
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I feel that it...

34:11.875 --> 34:13.920
Your ass was
supposed to be the lookout.

34:13.964 --> 34:15.226
I was!

34:15.270 --> 34:16.663
But then I saw a guy,

34:16.706 --> 34:18.317
he looked like
he had information, and...

34:18.360 --> 34:21.101
In my defense,
I was on something.

34:21.146 --> 34:23.409
Yeah, you was, girl. His dick.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.193
Mm!

34:25.237 --> 34:26.542
All right, all right.

34:26.585 --> 34:28.762
Wait.
So you off the tuna boat now?

34:28.804 --> 34:30.503
First of all,
I was married to a man.

34:30.545 --> 34:32.002
Right, right, right,
right, right. Second of all,

34:32.025 --> 34:33.984
hell no.

34:34.027 --> 34:36.117
I just took a detour, and...

34:36.161 --> 34:38.685
God, I was so messed up.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.643
I was thinking I was with Arlene
the whole time.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.123
Aww.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.101
You know things ain't over
between the both of y'all.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.172
Unlike you and Ken, girl.

34:47.215 --> 34:49.652
Yeah, well, I need to be single,

34:49.696 --> 34:51.437
and there is
no rebounding for me.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.788
Okay, that is good for you,
but yo' ass...

34:54.831 --> 34:57.312
You and Arlene need to stop
playing around.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.097
I mean, y'all love each other,

34:59.140 --> 35:00.315
y'all need to admit it

35:00.359 --> 35:01.621
and just go on and be together.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.101
Hmm.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.583
What? It's just...

35:07.627 --> 35:09.126
I'm getting a voicemail
from pot to kettle.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.760
Me and Roller
don't love each other.

35:10.804 --> 35:11.979
Mm-hmm.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.087
I mean, we goin' on a date
tonight,

35:13.111 --> 35:14.199
but that ain't nothin'!

35:14.242 --> 35:15.722
- You're going on a date?
- What?

35:16.766 --> 35:18.333
You know what, we're done here.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.987
A date, date?

35:20.030 --> 35:21.467
- A for real date?!
- Yes!

35:21.510 --> 35:23.991
Wait till you see
what he's wearing!

35:24.034 --> 35:25.819
I picked it out.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.081
I picked it out.

35:32.782 --> 35:36.264
I guess maybe...

35:36.308 --> 35:37.874
a redneck family of sociopaths

35:37.918 --> 35:41.008
ain't the right group
to run a rehab, apparently.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.966
No. No, no.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.838
Don't doubt your vision.

35:44.881 --> 35:47.493
That's part of
the "Get It, Get It" principles.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.190
See, you got to keep
"getting it,"

35:49.234 --> 35:50.887
even once you got get, you know.

35:50.931 --> 35:53.107
I mean, you get to go ahead...

35:54.326 --> 35:57.285
Hello, Clay. Hi, Bryce.

35:57.329 --> 35:58.721
Hey. Whoa, whoa!

35:58.765 --> 36:01.333
Hey! Stay away from me, Brenda.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.465
I know, I'm the last person

36:03.509 --> 36:05.163
you want to see right now,
but...

36:05.206 --> 36:07.426
I got to get clean

36:07.469 --> 36:09.341
if I want to make things right
with Jenn.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.299
Yeah, that ship
might have sailed.

36:11.343 --> 36:12.996
On account of
you blowin' this one here.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.131
Ever since that night,

36:17.175 --> 36:19.916
everything
I touch turns to shit.

36:19.960 --> 36:24.356
My award-winning
succulent garden

36:24.399 --> 36:26.836
at the...
At the mobile home park,

36:26.880 --> 36:30.927
it... it just got decimated
by slugs.

36:30.971 --> 36:35.541
I just lost my job
mentoring Christian youth.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.543
I can't win. Come here,
come here, come here.

36:37.586 --> 36:42.461
Sit down, sit down. I just got another DUI.

36:42.504 --> 36:46.073
Court-ordered rehab this time,
the whole nine.

36:46.116 --> 36:48.902
Damn. This shit's depressing.

36:50.077 --> 36:51.359
I'm sorry you're suffering,
Brenda,

36:51.383 --> 36:52.775
but I...
I don't think it's healthy

36:52.819 --> 36:54.362
for you to be here
at this point in time.

36:54.386 --> 36:56.170
Now, now,
just hold on there, Bryce.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.303
She's a...
She's a woman in need.

36:58.346 --> 36:59.913
If a woman
can't turn to her family,

36:59.956 --> 37:00.870
who can she turn to?

37:00.914 --> 37:01.871
Safe Harbor Rehab,

37:01.915 --> 37:02.872
Better Days Rehab,

37:02.916 --> 37:03.873
Charlie Sheen Rehab...

37:03.917 --> 37:05.310
All right, come on.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.094
Just stay right there.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.792
Look, I know it's uncomfortable.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.620
Uncomfortable?
Jenn is right next door!

37:11.664 --> 37:13.274
Yeah, but she needs us!

37:13.318 --> 37:14.841
We need our first client.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.191
So suck it up.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.805
All right, Miss Brenda.

37:22.849 --> 37:26.983
Welcome to Rock Bottom,
and the rest of your life.

37:32.075 --> 37:35.165
I feel like Joe needs
to zhuzh up the Baccarat room,

37:35.209 --> 37:36.819
not to...

37:36.863 --> 37:38.821
Excuse me,
what are you doing here?

37:38.865 --> 37:40.823
I forgot to put my name
on the door.

37:40.867 --> 37:43.565
You've got a lot of nerve,

37:43.609 --> 37:45.654
acting like you're the.
Like I own the place?

37:45.698 --> 37:46.612
I do.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.178
And I'm taking over.

37:48.222 --> 37:52.444
See, I know all about
the Governor taking bribes

37:52.487 --> 37:56.012
to build his shady
private prisons.

37:56.056 --> 38:00.234
So you two are going to be
silent partners

38:00.278 --> 38:01.931
from here on in.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.977
What makes you think
we'd give in to your demands?

38:04.020 --> 38:06.066
Because if you don't,

38:06.109 --> 38:07.807
I'm gonna tell
everything I know,

38:07.850 --> 38:09.896
especially the part about
the two of you

38:09.939 --> 38:12.115
throwing freaky-ass sex parties
for the Governor.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.901
She's the one who tied up Marsha
in the closet.

38:14.944 --> 38:17.164
Desna, think about
what you're saying.

38:17.207 --> 38:20.080
You'd be destroying the casino
that you're benefiting from.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.342
I'd rather not.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.953
But push me.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.215
I dare you.

38:25.259 --> 38:28.915
And I will blow this bitch
all the way up.

38:28.958 --> 38:31.004
Watch me.

38:32.484 --> 38:34.877
You are stepping
into a world of darkness

38:34.921 --> 38:37.924
that you will not find
your way out of.

38:40.361 --> 38:44.365
Look, I get
that you two play dirty,

38:44.409 --> 38:46.715
but I play dirtier.

38:46.759 --> 38:50.066
I'm pulling the plug on this
private prison bullshit,

38:50.110 --> 38:54.810
and if anything happens to me
or anyone I love,

38:54.854 --> 38:58.379
everything I know goes
to the media and the FBI.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.687
So don't even think
you can step to me

39:01.730 --> 39:03.384
the way you did Penelope.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.299
Move.

39:08.433 --> 39:11.131
Looks like
we underestimated you.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.220
That's the story of my life.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.485
I don't want to anymore.

39:17.529 --> 39:19.966
I want to go home. Please?

39:20.009 --> 39:25.319
Okay, well, you know,
she doesn't have to do this.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.190
Hey, are you scared to meet him?

39:27.234 --> 39:28.975
I don't want to talk about it.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.934
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.373
You know how much I love you.

39:36.461 --> 39:39.942
And you know there's nothing
in the whole wide world

39:39.986 --> 39:42.031
that could make me
stop loving you?

39:42.075 --> 39:46.384
Even if you ended up liking EJ,
even if you loved him.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.039
You know why?

39:51.258 --> 39:55.436
Because I chose you
to be my daughter.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.090
You're not mad?

39:58.221 --> 40:00.485
No, baby girl. I'm not mad.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.705
Hey. Hey.

40:03.749 --> 40:06.273
Brienne, this is EJ.

40:06.316 --> 40:09.668
Hi, Brienne.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.496
This is for you.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.152
You know,
I hear that you like swings.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.545
Yeah!

40:17.589 --> 40:19.895
You want to find out
who can go the highest?

40:19.939 --> 40:21.636
Come on.

40:26.511 --> 40:29.035
It'll be okay.

40:41.526 --> 40:42.527
See you later. Bye.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.006
Just listen to me.

40:44.050 --> 40:45.355
I thought we were done.

40:45.399 --> 40:46.966
We've been doing this all wrong.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.489
Or you have. Just...

40:48.533 --> 40:52.232
Up until now, it's been
"Don't ask, don't tell" with us.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.715
You don't ask about
my criminal life,

40:53.755 --> 40:55.104
I don't know about
your cop shit,

40:55.148 --> 40:56.366
but that doesn't work with us.

40:56.410 --> 40:57.585
You're still talking.

40:57.629 --> 40:58.891
My point is,

40:58.934 --> 41:00.172
it doesn't have to be that way.

41:00.196 --> 41:01.260
Why don't we do the opposite?

41:01.284 --> 41:02.590
Do ask, do tell.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.940
About everything.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.292
Everything? Yes.

41:09.336 --> 41:10.511
Are you insane?

41:10.555 --> 41:12.339
For example,

41:12.382 --> 41:13.993
I recently had sex with a man.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.348
How was that?

41:21.391 --> 41:23.481
I'm here, aren't I?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.714
Welcome to our new place.

41:39.758 --> 41:41.281
Take it all in.

41:41.324 --> 41:44.458
Oh, my God, Des,
this is beautiful!

41:44.502 --> 41:46.068
Right?

41:46.112 --> 41:48.767
And you look bomb.
Where you think you going?

41:48.810 --> 41:50.029
I'm going out with Roller.

41:50.072 --> 41:51.552
I told you,
we got a date tonight.

41:51.596 --> 41:54.816
Ah! Breakin' in
the new bed, huh?

41:54.860 --> 41:56.165
No, an actual date.

41:56.209 --> 41:59.647
Look, you two
are gonna love this place.

41:59.691 --> 42:01.475
Deanie, it's got
the dual masters

42:01.519 --> 42:02.694
we've always dreamed of.

42:02.737 --> 42:04.826
Y'all can go, get y'all shit,

42:04.870 --> 42:06.262
and move up in here tonight.

42:06.306 --> 42:07.612
What? Yeah!

42:07.655 --> 42:08.961
Oh, my God. I love you, Desna!

42:09.004 --> 42:10.092
I always have!

42:10.136 --> 42:12.268
Wait, wait. Move in?

42:12.312 --> 42:15.315
Yeah! No reason to stay
at that trick-ho motel

42:15.358 --> 42:16.403
any longer, right?

42:16.446 --> 42:18.100
Yeah, girl, you right.

42:18.144 --> 42:20.450
Uh, I'm really happy
for you, Desna,

42:20.494 --> 42:21.974
and this place reflects

42:22.017 --> 42:23.817
all the things that
you've ever wanted, but...

42:23.845 --> 42:25.281
We can't move in.

42:25.325 --> 42:26.587
Why? Yeah, why?

42:26.631 --> 42:28.633
Because I'm...
I'm my own man, Virginia,

42:28.676 --> 42:30.678
and she likes to control
everything I do.

42:30.722 --> 42:32.027
Even yesterday with Mac,

42:32.071 --> 42:33.396
you told me
we couldn't be friends.

42:33.420 --> 42:34.682
I like Mahjong.

42:34.726 --> 42:36.423
And you said
I needed a new purpose.

42:36.466 --> 42:38.033
And he wants to teach me!

42:38.077 --> 42:40.775
Dean, I keep trying to tell you,

42:40.819 --> 42:43.169
Mac and Melba
are not good people.

42:43.212 --> 42:45.171
Then you should
stay away from them, too!

42:45.214 --> 42:47.042
But you won't
because you want the money.

42:47.086 --> 42:48.261
Well, I want a friend, and...

42:48.304 --> 42:51.743
And I want to live
with Virginia, alone.

42:51.786 --> 42:55.311
Dean, I want us
to live with Des.

42:55.355 --> 42:58.837
Listen to Virginia, baby.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.926
I want you to live here.

43:00.969 --> 43:02.797
Dean,
I'm still worried about you.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.712
No.I want to keep an eye on you.

43:04.756 --> 43:06.279
No, I'll say it really simply.

43:06.322 --> 43:08.716
I'd rather live in a trick-ho
motel with my fiancée

43:08.760 --> 43:10.631
than live here with you.

43:10.675 --> 43:12.198
Children live
with their sisters.

43:12.241 --> 43:14.722
And I'm a... I'm a man.

43:14.766 --> 43:17.246
I'm a... I'm a man.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.118
I'm a man.

43:19.161 --> 43:20.641
Let's... Virginia, let's go.

43:20.685 --> 43:22.382
Dean, please.

43:22.425 --> 43:23.862
