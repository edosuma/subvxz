WEBVTT

00:00.271 --> 00:01.638
My name
is Michael Westen.

00:02.047 --> 00:04.081
I used to be
a spy until...

00:04.432 --> 00:05.515
We got a burn notice on you.

00:05.566 --> 00:07.401
You're blacklisted.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.853
When you're burned,
you've got nothing--

00:09.904 --> 00:12.072
no cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.156 --> 00:14.441
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.525 --> 00:16.860
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.911 --> 00:19.196
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.247 --> 00:21.365
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...

00:22.867 --> 00:23.834
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.901 --> 00:25.252
Should we shoot them?

00:25.336 --> 00:27.254
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.338 --> 00:29.906
You know spies--
bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.957 --> 00:31.291
Family too...

00:31.376 --> 00:32.241
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:32.293 --> 00:33.410
If you're desperate...

00:33.461 --> 00:34.741
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

00:34.762 --> 00:37.431
And a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.016
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.083 --> 00:41.751
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.803 --> 00:44.755
you're not going anywhere.

00:45.022 --> 00:46.473
It's a deep-cover job,

00:46.557 --> 00:48.008
going after the leader
of a terrorist network.

00:48.092 --> 00:50.927
I need you to bring them down,
no matter what.

00:50.978 --> 00:53.647
I'm James.
Welcome to the family.

00:53.731 --> 00:55.131
This guy, James--
he's getting to you.

00:55.182 --> 00:56.816
They all are.

00:56.901 --> 00:58.801
It's difficult to work so hard
to be part of something,

00:58.853 --> 01:00.403
knowing you have
to destroy it.

01:00.471 --> 01:01.905
These people believe
in what they're doing.

01:01.972 --> 01:03.940
The data you ripped from
Sonya's phone was a gold mine.

01:03.991 --> 01:05.909
- So we know where James is?
- No.

01:05.976 --> 01:07.310
But for the first time,
we know where he's gonna be

01:07.361 --> 01:10.030
before he gets there--
Veracruz, Mexico.

01:17.955 --> 01:19.989
Alpha team,
I'm a friendly.

01:20.041 --> 01:22.208
- Hey!
- Simon.

01:22.293 --> 01:24.761
I'm running this extraction,
on orders of the CIA.

01:24.828 --> 01:26.329
You're working
with a monster!

01:26.380 --> 01:28.548
And what is Michael, huh?

01:28.633 --> 01:32.001
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.338
Only two people in the world
knew exactly

01:35.389 --> 01:36.806
where we'd be today.

01:36.857 --> 01:39.142
Me...

01:39.193 --> 01:40.477
And you.

01:40.528 --> 01:42.062
I would never betray you.

01:42.146 --> 01:45.532
I'm gonna give you
five seconds to come clean

01:45.616 --> 01:47.567
before this becomes
a lot more painful.

01:47.652 --> 01:50.153
She didn't betray you.
I did.

01:50.204 --> 01:52.055
I'm working with the CIA.

01:54.625 --> 01:57.327
A spy's job,
at the most basic level,

01:57.378 --> 01:59.212
is to deceive.

01:59.297 --> 02:00.630
You build a lie.

02:00.681 --> 02:03.550
You nurture that lie,
selling it to your target,

02:03.634 --> 02:06.002
bit by bit,
until he believes.

02:06.053 --> 02:09.439
Your lie becomes your weapon,
your salvation,

02:09.507 --> 02:14.227
the only thing that stands
between you and disaster.

02:14.312 --> 02:16.480
When that lie falls away,

02:16.531 --> 02:18.532
you're left
with only the hard truth

02:18.616 --> 02:20.567
of who you are
and what you've done.

02:20.651 --> 02:22.319
When that happens,
you're out of moves.

02:22.370 --> 02:26.239
The only thing there is
to do then is await your fate.

02:26.324 --> 02:29.042
Come on.
James wants to talk.

02:36.667 --> 02:39.636
I want you
to tell me something.

02:39.703 --> 02:42.372
Was any of it real?

02:42.423 --> 02:44.391
Between us?

02:47.228 --> 02:50.547
I had a job to do, Sonya--

02:50.598 --> 02:54.434
get close to you, close
to the people you work with.

02:54.519 --> 02:56.403
You didn't answer
the question.

03:01.409 --> 03:04.778
I was undercover for so long,
I lost track of who I was.

03:07.498 --> 03:08.731
And part of me--

03:08.783 --> 03:12.068
the part that believed
in what we were doing--

03:12.119 --> 03:14.254
that part...

03:16.407 --> 03:19.092
cared for you.

03:19.177 --> 03:22.429
And you?

03:22.513 --> 03:26.433
Were you just recruiting
an asset?

03:26.517 --> 03:29.052
I had a job to do too.

03:29.103 --> 03:32.422
Did I take pleasure in it?
Yes.

03:32.473 --> 03:35.609
My heart belongs to my work.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.361
It will always come first.

04:05.389 --> 04:07.007
Sit.

04:14.599 --> 04:17.966
I have been contemplating
our circumstances, Michael,

04:18.019 --> 04:21.654
and I'm deeply concerned
by what you've done.

04:21.738 --> 04:23.773
I have questions,
important questions,

04:23.824 --> 04:28.361
questions that will determine
your future...

04:28.446 --> 04:30.080
and ours.

04:30.147 --> 04:31.865
What do you want to know?

04:31.949 --> 04:34.334
I need to know
exactly what the CIA wants.

04:34.418 --> 04:36.419
They want the leader
of this group.

04:36.487 --> 04:39.589
They want you.
Hmm.

04:39.657 --> 04:40.897
And if you
don't give them that?

04:40.925 --> 04:43.126
My friends will spend
the rest of their lives

04:43.177 --> 04:45.095
a CIA detention center.

04:49.183 --> 04:53.937
What we do here together...

04:54.004 --> 04:56.690
What we stand for...

04:56.774 --> 04:58.108
Do you believe in it?

04:58.175 --> 05:00.843
And don't...

05:00.895 --> 05:02.896
Give me the answer
that you think I want.

05:02.980 --> 05:06.866
What I want is the truth.

05:06.951 --> 05:09.519
I haven't always agreed
with your methods,

05:09.570 --> 05:12.872
but the jobs
I've helped you with,

05:12.957 --> 05:16.242
the ones no one else
was willing to do,

05:16.327 --> 05:18.662
they needed to be done.

05:18.713 --> 05:22.215
We protect what is important.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.800
You made me part of something

05:23.867 --> 05:27.253
that's bigger than you,
bigger than me.

05:27.338 --> 05:30.840
You made me believe there is
something worth fighting for,

05:30.891 --> 05:32.258
something to believe in.

05:35.179 --> 05:38.381
I believe in you,
Michael Westen.

05:38.432 --> 05:40.049
Always have.

05:42.436 --> 05:45.105
I think
there's a way out of this,

05:45.189 --> 05:47.490
a way to salvage
our organization,

05:47.558 --> 05:51.611
a way to save your friends,
a way to save yourself.

05:51.696 --> 05:55.732
But in order to do that, I need
you to do something for me.

05:55.783 --> 05:58.201
I need you to go
back to Miami

05:58.252 --> 06:02.505
and return yourself
to the good graces of the CIA.

06:02.573 --> 06:06.509
I need you to tell them
a story.

06:06.577 --> 06:09.846
I need you to convince them
that you barely escaped with us

06:09.913 --> 06:12.932
after the mission went wrong.

06:13.017 --> 06:15.418
I need you to convince them
that you looked

06:15.469 --> 06:17.420
for an opportunity
to capture me yourself,

06:17.471 --> 06:20.523
you moved heaven and earth
to complete your task,

06:20.591 --> 06:22.776
but it proved impossible.

06:26.096 --> 06:29.866
And I need you
to convince them

06:29.933 --> 06:33.370
that you made me believe
I was betrayed by an underling,

06:33.437 --> 06:37.290
and you have heroically returned
home to continue your work.

06:40.411 --> 06:41.944
Will you do that?

06:45.633 --> 06:47.667
Will you lie
to the CIA for me?

06:55.676 --> 06:57.627
Jesus, Michael!

06:57.678 --> 06:58.845
We thought you were dead.

06:58.929 --> 07:00.797
Yeah, I'm in Mexico.
I'm fine.

07:00.848 --> 07:03.266
Good.

07:03.317 --> 07:06.903
And the operation?

07:06.970 --> 07:09.439
My cover is intact.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.362
The operation is still alive.

07:11.387 --> 07:15.387
<font color=#00FF00>Burn Notice 7x12</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Sea Change</font>

07:21.067 --> 07:24.019
As a spy, when you stop
believing in the orders

07:24.070 --> 07:26.105
you've been given,
you can't just walk away.

07:26.189 --> 07:29.358
You have to go deeper.

07:29.409 --> 07:32.695
You have to lie to the people
giving those orders.

07:36.249 --> 07:38.584
You have to act
as if nothing's wrong.

07:38.668 --> 07:41.954
Mr. Westen,
please empty your pockets.

07:42.038 --> 07:44.623
And you have to make everyone
think you're dedicated

07:44.708 --> 07:47.376
to the very operation
you're trying to destroy.

07:49.596 --> 07:51.130
We've been over this report

07:51.214 --> 07:53.882
half a dozen times, and I can't
make heads or tails of it,

07:53.934 --> 07:56.602
especially why the hell
James Kendrick

07:56.686 --> 07:58.520
isn't in our custody
right now.

07:58.588 --> 08:01.307
The operative in charge of
the extraction team was killed.

08:01.391 --> 08:03.192
It would have been
too big a risk

08:03.259 --> 08:06.145
for Westen to try to apprehend
Kendrick on his own.

08:06.229 --> 08:07.646
Isn't that what your man
is supposed to do--

08:07.731 --> 08:08.891
take risks, get the job done?

08:09.405 --> 08:10.915
I believe that was part

08:10.916 --> 08:13.317
of the understanding in the deal
you made with him

08:13.369 --> 08:14.786
to come on board
this operation.

08:14.837 --> 08:16.788
Yes, sir, the concern
was that making a move

08:16.839 --> 08:18.039
would have blown
his cover.

08:18.123 --> 08:21.709
And not making a move
got us exactly nothing.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.044
Now, we're all questioning

08:23.128 --> 08:26.497
why you handed over
a mission this sensitive

08:26.548 --> 08:29.350
to an operative
with his, uh...

08:29.435 --> 08:30.501
reputation.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.003
If it weren't
for Westen, sir,

08:33.054 --> 08:35.390
we wouldn't be
as close as we are.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.342
Close doesn't count for much
if he can't finish the job.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.279
We can still pull this
together.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.197
We just need a little more--
you've been singing that song

08:43.282 --> 08:44.732
for the better part of a decade,
and you know what?

08:44.817 --> 08:46.234
I'm tired of hearing it.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.237
Now, I am pulling this operation
from Clandestine Services

08:49.321 --> 08:51.039
and sending it back upstairs
for analysis.

08:51.123 --> 08:52.957
If we decide

08:53.024 --> 08:55.526
that this network
is still worth going after,

08:55.577 --> 08:56.661
we'll assign a new team.

08:56.712 --> 08:59.797
This is our only shot, sir.

08:59.865 --> 09:03.084
Once Kendrick is gone,
he's gone.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.471
Well, maybe your operative
should have thought about that

09:06.538 --> 09:08.556
before letting
the bastard walk away.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.342
That operative you're talking
about is sitting right here.

09:11.393 --> 09:12.393
Excuse me?

09:12.478 --> 09:15.045
With all due respect...

09:15.097 --> 09:17.682
When was the last time
you were in the field?

09:17.733 --> 09:20.401
When was the last time you
had dinner with James Kendrick?

09:23.522 --> 09:26.157
I am the Director
of central intelligence

09:26.224 --> 09:29.861
for the entire goddamn USA.

09:29.912 --> 09:33.364
If I say this Op is over,
it's over.

09:33.415 --> 09:36.200
When I started this Op,
you thought Randall Burke

09:36.251 --> 09:38.035
was the head of this network.

09:38.087 --> 09:39.287
I'm the one who dug deeper.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.038
I discovered James Kendrick

09:41.090 --> 09:42.840
is sitting on the top
of this pyramid.

09:42.908 --> 09:45.593
Now, you can't expect me to just
walk away from this, not now.

09:47.713 --> 09:50.681
Now, I know him better
than anyone in this room,

09:50.749 --> 09:52.717
and if you shut this down,

09:52.768 --> 09:55.252
you lose all hope
of stopping him.

09:57.106 --> 10:00.558
Sir, I'm asking you
to trust me.

10:00.609 --> 10:03.861
Let me bring this home.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.404
You have 48 hours.

10:13.455 --> 10:16.124
If you don't have it
wrapped up by then,

10:16.208 --> 10:19.443
we'll be back here deciding
how deep a pit to toss you into.

10:24.883 --> 10:27.001
Michael, it's me.

10:28.971 --> 10:30.588
I have been calling you
for hours.

10:30.639 --> 10:34.142
- Sorry, Fi.
- I spoke to Strong.

10:34.226 --> 10:35.810
Not only did he say
you want us off the job,

10:35.894 --> 10:37.562
but we're not supposed
to even have contact with you?

10:37.629 --> 10:39.129
What is going on?

10:39.181 --> 10:41.649
I don't want to get into it.
I have to do this on my own.

10:41.733 --> 10:44.152
James and Sonya are dangerous.
You know this!

10:44.236 --> 10:45.820
I can handle them.

10:45.904 --> 10:49.807
If things get bad,
the CIA will back me up.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.826
You're gonna trust
the CIA over us?

10:53.111 --> 10:54.662
They let Simon
lead the last Op,

10:54.746 --> 10:56.414
for God's sake!
They were in a tough spot.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.950
They're just trying
to finish this.

10:59.001 --> 11:00.751
Do you hear yourself?

11:00.819 --> 11:03.921
We're talking about Simon!
I know, and I don't care!

11:03.989 --> 11:06.007
I just--

11:07.176 --> 11:09.844
I just want this to be over.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.683
You can't do this alone,
Michael.

11:15.767 --> 11:20.004
If your cover is blown, the CIA
are gonna hang you out to dry.

11:22.941 --> 11:25.676
You know what
you'll be left with?

11:28.697 --> 11:31.315
This.

11:31.366 --> 11:32.783
And that's it.

11:32.851 --> 11:34.685
And these?

11:37.322 --> 11:40.190
They're not enough.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.910
You need our help.

11:42.995 --> 11:45.863
I'm sorry, Fi.
It has to be this way.

11:50.702 --> 11:54.171
I hope you know
what you're doing.

12:10.656 --> 12:13.157
Okay, Fi.
This better be important.

12:13.224 --> 12:15.826
Elsa wasn't happy with me
running out at dawn.

12:15.894 --> 12:18.746
Oh, it's important.

12:18.830 --> 12:21.916
I put a tracker
in Michael's gun.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.401
He's hiding something,
and I want to know what it is.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.236
Wait a minute.
What?

12:26.288 --> 12:27.672
I put a fake bullet
in his clip

12:27.739 --> 12:30.258
that's transmitting
his location.

12:30.342 --> 12:32.076
You're spying on Mike?

12:32.127 --> 12:34.595
Look, why would he ask us
to help him all this time,

12:34.680 --> 12:37.298
then kick us off the job
and out of his life?

12:37.382 --> 12:39.016
It doesn't make sense.
Come on, Fi.

12:39.084 --> 12:40.601
It's his mission.
He's the one on the inside.

12:40.686 --> 12:42.553
We got to let him
do his thing.

12:42.604 --> 12:45.255
He's been acting strangely
ever since he met James.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.357
You know I'm right.

12:46.424 --> 12:47.725
He told you himself--

12:47.776 --> 12:49.259
he's starting to question
his own loyalty.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.361
And he said
he was handling it.

12:50.428 --> 12:51.979
Sam, he didn't even mind

12:52.064 --> 12:54.615
that the CIA hired Simon.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.120
Look, Fi, he's been
under a lot of stress.

12:59.204 --> 13:01.438
You know, he almost died
in Mexico.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.157
So just because he seems
a little off

13:03.241 --> 13:04.562
doesn't mean
he's up to something.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.661
For what it's worth,
he's on the move.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.663
Heading north on I-95.
Come on, Jesse.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.581
You're not buying this too?
I'm-

13:10.632 --> 13:12.550
I'm not saying I'm convinced,
but I don't know why we can't

13:12.617 --> 13:14.618
just follow him around a bit,
see what he's doing.

13:14.670 --> 13:17.287
If it's nothing,
we'll all sleep better, right?

13:17.339 --> 13:20.224
Wow.
Spy on a spy.

13:20.291 --> 13:23.644
I guess that's us.
Okay, let's do it.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.160
Oh, my goodness,
I'm starving.

13:39.244 --> 13:41.162
I really wish I would have
finished that breakfast burrito.

13:41.246 --> 13:42.886
Well, I wish
we weren't doing this at all.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.082
This is a waste of time.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.584
I don't know.
You got to admit--

13:46.651 --> 13:48.502
it's a little odd, Mike drives
all the way to Lauderdale

13:48.587 --> 13:50.338
just to sit in his car
for an hour.

13:50.422 --> 13:52.423
Well, maybe he's following up
a lead for the CIA.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.125
- For what?
- What does it matter?

13:54.176 --> 13:56.377
This just feels wrong.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.828
You know what?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.547
I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this right now.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.932
I'm just gonna call him.

14:11.342 --> 14:12.610
Hey, Sam.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.862
Yeah, hey, Mike, uh,
I just swung by the loft,

14:14.946 --> 14:16.697
you know, to check in,
see what's going on,

14:16.782 --> 14:17.948
and you weren't there.

14:18.016 --> 14:19.283
Where did you run off to?

14:19.350 --> 14:21.518
Yeah, I took a ride up
to Fort Lauderdale,

14:21.570 --> 14:22.703
checking on a few leads.

14:22.788 --> 14:25.573
Oh, you're in Fort Lauderdale?
Okay.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.541
Do you want me to head out there
and give you a hand?

14:27.626 --> 14:28.987
Well, there's nothing
to help with.

14:28.994 --> 14:31.128
James is laying low
out of the country.

14:31.196 --> 14:33.864
I don't think he'll make contact
for at least a few days.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.499
Okay, well, if you need me,

14:35.550 --> 14:36.917
you know where
to find me, brother.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.469
Thanks, Sam.

14:38.536 --> 14:41.305
Okay, there you go.
Everything's fine.

14:41.372 --> 14:43.674
He said James isn't gonna make
contact for a couple of days.

14:43.725 --> 14:45.509
In the meantime,
he's just checking out a lead.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.562
Wait a minute.

14:48.647 --> 14:51.015
Mike said he's not meeting James
for a couple days?

14:51.066 --> 14:53.717
Yeah, that's right.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.220
Who the hell's that?

15:00.192 --> 15:03.494
- Son of a bitch.
- Mike lied to us.

15:03.561 --> 15:04.728
He's lying to us.
No, come on, hey.

15:04.780 --> 15:05.863
He's got to be making a play.

15:05.914 --> 15:06.864
What the hell
are you talking about?

15:06.915 --> 15:08.199
What kind of play?

15:08.250 --> 15:10.400
Look, you can lie to yourself
all you want.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.070
That doesn't change the fact--
Jesse, don't say it.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.456
Mike is not a traitor.
You need to wake up.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.842
He kicked us off the job.
He's lying to us.

15:17.909 --> 15:20.511
Look at him.
Tell me I'm wrong.

15:22.914 --> 15:25.099
No, you're not wrong.

15:25.183 --> 15:27.017
Mike switched sides.

15:31.690 --> 15:34.408
Are you telling me
my son's a traitor?

15:36.161 --> 15:38.245
I know this is hard.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.897
James has been messing
with his head.

15:39.948 --> 15:41.448
I've never seen Michael
like this.

15:41.533 --> 15:42.900
Tell me where he is.

15:42.951 --> 15:44.368
It's not that simple.

15:44.419 --> 15:48.071
- I want to talk to him!
- Well, he doesn't want to talk.

15:48.123 --> 15:50.541
He pulled us off the job.
He's not returning our calls.

15:50.592 --> 15:52.293
Then why are you bothering
to tell me this?

15:52.377 --> 15:54.044
Tell me, what do you want?

15:54.095 --> 15:55.462
Tell me what to do!

16:01.269 --> 16:02.853
We need to get him away

16:02.921 --> 16:05.472
from James and Sonya,

16:05.557 --> 16:06.924
from all of it.

16:06.975 --> 16:10.644
Fiona, this house
is being watched!

16:10.729 --> 16:12.229
What's gonna happen
to Charlie and me

16:12.280 --> 16:15.282
if Michael
goes missing, hmm?

16:17.152 --> 16:20.738
We'll get you both away,
someplace safe,

16:20.789 --> 16:23.273
and then we can focus
on Michael.

16:27.462 --> 16:29.413
Hi, sweetheart.

16:29.464 --> 16:30.581
You go back in.

16:30.632 --> 16:31.582
Grandma will be there
in a minute.

16:31.633 --> 16:33.667
I love you.

16:35.253 --> 16:37.671
You're asking me to go
on the run...

16:37.756 --> 16:41.225
With a child?

16:41.292 --> 16:44.561
It's the only chance
Michael has.

16:56.691 --> 16:59.526
Fine.

16:59.611 --> 17:03.831
Give me a couple of days
to put our stuff together.

17:03.915 --> 17:05.749
Madeline...

17:10.320 --> 17:13.089
We only have
a couple hours.

17:25.553 --> 17:27.972
- We're in safe waters now.
- Good.

17:28.022 --> 17:29.606
Here's where
the operation stands.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.443
The CIA has given me 36 hours
to finish this

17:32.510 --> 17:34.194
before they shut it down.

17:34.279 --> 17:36.313
Well,
then we'll have to move fast.

17:36.364 --> 17:39.450
James, there's--I don't know
what else we can do.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.402
The CIA won't accept
anything less

17:41.486 --> 17:43.487
than you thrown
in a dark hole.

17:43.538 --> 17:45.873
I'm aware of that.

17:45.957 --> 17:48.909
I've thought about this matter
for quite some time, and...

17:48.994 --> 17:53.330
There is only one course
of action open to us.

17:53.381 --> 17:56.700
Michael...

17:58.887 --> 18:01.371
You have to turn me in.

18:01.423 --> 18:03.206
- What?
- Yeah.

18:03.258 --> 18:04.207
- No.
- Yes.

18:04.259 --> 18:06.643
James, we can't.

18:06.711 --> 18:10.714
Sonya, the CIA has
my face and name.

18:10.765 --> 18:12.266
I have been compromised,

18:12.350 --> 18:14.268
and they won't stop hunting us
until they bring me down,

18:14.352 --> 18:17.271
so I must be brought down.

18:17.355 --> 18:21.275
What they don't realize is
that our work will continue.

18:21.359 --> 18:23.944
How will it continue
without a leader?

18:24.029 --> 18:26.580
I see two leaders
standing right before me.

18:29.534 --> 18:31.035
James, I'm not sure
what you're thinking, but--

18:31.086 --> 18:32.703
It's simple.

18:32.754 --> 18:34.254
When you turn me over
to the authorities,

18:34.339 --> 18:35.422
you'll be a hero.

18:35.507 --> 18:37.257
You'll be the man
who captured me,

18:37.342 --> 18:39.043
and the CIA will never suspect

18:39.094 --> 18:42.412
that their ace operative
is protecting us from within.

18:44.382 --> 18:46.934
I know.
It's a lot to process.

18:52.140 --> 18:53.941
I have always had
great faith in you.

18:57.929 --> 19:01.231
You can do this.

19:01.282 --> 19:02.933
Michael, you said it yourself.

19:02.984 --> 19:04.735
The only way
to keep your friends

19:04.786 --> 19:09.289
from living a life in prison--
turn me in.

19:09.374 --> 19:11.241
I'm giving you that...

19:18.116 --> 19:21.385
and so much more.

19:25.056 --> 19:26.890
And this...

19:29.310 --> 19:32.129
This is a beautiful thing.

19:32.180 --> 19:35.816
For them, it'll be over,
but for you two--

19:35.900 --> 19:37.184
only the beginning.

19:37.268 --> 19:39.736
- The CIA will want an update.
- Mm-hmm.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.989
What do you want me
to tell them?

19:42.073 --> 19:45.809
You just tell them
I'm coming to town.

19:47.278 --> 19:51.165
And you keep them at a distance
until we're ready.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.752
Michael, where are you?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.504
I don't have
a lot of time to talk,

19:57.589 --> 20:01.041
but James is coming to Miami.

20:01.126 --> 20:02.342
Get your team ready.

20:13.471 --> 20:15.472
Hey, look at you.

20:15.523 --> 20:17.764
How the hell did you get
a seaplane on such short notice?

20:17.809 --> 20:19.509
I had a few buddies
put some things together,

20:19.561 --> 20:20.844
in case of an emergency.

20:20.895 --> 20:22.512
I'd definitely say
this is an emergency.

20:22.564 --> 20:24.531
- Yeah, you all set here?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:24.616 --> 20:26.984
Not bad
for an unfinished mansion, huh?

20:27.035 --> 20:28.485
All right, so we get Mike
in the boathouse,

20:28.536 --> 20:30.821
surround him,
get him on that plane.

20:30.872 --> 20:34.024
- Yeah.
- You all right?

20:34.075 --> 20:37.794
Yeah, it's just--I don't know
how this is gonna work.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.030
I mean, even if we pull it off,
Mike's just gonna hate us.

20:40.081 --> 20:43.250
Look, Sam, I know what it's
like being on the other side.

20:43.334 --> 20:45.335
When I found out Mike burned me,
I wanted to kill the guy.

20:45.386 --> 20:47.087
I'd spend hours
thinking about the moment

20:47.172 --> 20:48.493
I could put a bullet
in his brain.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.707
That doesn't really make me
feel any better.

20:50.758 --> 20:52.476
But my point is, you guys
helped me see that I was wrong.

20:52.543 --> 20:55.145
You helped me see Mike
for who he is.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.231
I came around.
So will he, all right?

20:57.315 --> 20:58.599
It might be a tough road,

20:58.683 --> 21:01.318
but I got to believe
we'll get there.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.654
I'll call Fi,
tell her we're ready.

21:11.996 --> 21:13.914
- Sam?
- Yeah, Fi.

21:13.998 --> 21:15.616
Did you ditch
those creeps outside?

21:15.700 --> 21:18.568
I'm working on it
right now.

21:18.620 --> 21:20.100
Madeline's not too happy
with our plan

21:20.171 --> 21:22.039
to burn her house down
as a distraction.

21:22.090 --> 21:23.590
Okay, well, we got a plane.

21:23.675 --> 21:25.092
As long as we're airborne
by 4:00, we're safe.

21:25.176 --> 21:26.260
We'll be there soon.

21:26.344 --> 21:27.744
Fi, make sure
you get away clean.

21:27.795 --> 21:30.264
This plan falls apart
if they follow you back here.

21:30.348 --> 21:32.933
They won't, Sam.

21:36.221 --> 21:38.555
You ready?

21:38.606 --> 21:41.225
Ready as I can be.

21:41.276 --> 21:42.809
It's not every day
you burn down

21:42.894 --> 21:45.562
a house you spent
45 years in, right?

21:48.149 --> 21:51.902
I'm sorry
we have to do this.

21:51.953 --> 21:55.122
You have a lot
of good memories here.

21:55.206 --> 21:58.909
Yeah, I got
a lot of bad ones too.

22:00.995 --> 22:03.613
This picture...

22:03.665 --> 22:06.883
Was taken the Christmas Frank
put me in the hospital.

22:08.670 --> 22:12.455
That morning was the happiest
I'd ever seen my boys.

22:14.225 --> 22:16.059
Then that night...

22:20.765 --> 22:23.984
I should have left here
a long time ago.

22:24.068 --> 22:27.154
I just couldn't do it.

22:27.238 --> 22:30.324
Well, you're not
the same woman that you were.

22:30.408 --> 22:33.110
You're stronger now.

22:35.830 --> 22:37.998
Hey, baby.
Pick up your backpack

22:38.082 --> 22:39.616
and meet grandma
at the back door.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.368
You hurry, now.

23:23.961 --> 23:25.796
Madeline.

23:43.931 --> 23:47.150
Come on!

23:47.218 --> 23:49.069
Check the window!

23:56.361 --> 23:59.246
What the hell?

24:25.155 --> 24:26.522
James arrives
in a few hours.

24:26.573 --> 24:29.409
By that time,
we'll be ready.

24:29.493 --> 24:31.027
This place is
pretty convincing

24:31.078 --> 24:32.528
for a place
you don't use anymore.

24:32.579 --> 24:34.280
It used to be
our transmission hub

24:34.365 --> 24:36.165
for our operatives
in the Caribbean.

24:36.233 --> 24:39.235
Then we recruited one
of the best satellite tech guys

24:39.286 --> 24:41.070
in Miami,
so we don't need it anymore.

24:41.121 --> 24:42.705
He's got us tapped
into a civilian station

24:42.756 --> 24:45.008
closer to the city now.

24:45.075 --> 24:47.293
Is the CIA on alert
and ready to go?

24:47.378 --> 24:48.678
Yeah, I'll call in a signal

24:48.745 --> 24:51.097
when it's time to move in
and capture James.

24:51.181 --> 24:52.465
How many units
will there be?

24:52.549 --> 24:53.916
Two special response teams,

24:53.968 --> 24:55.584
which means
a few dozen commandos

24:55.636 --> 24:57.720
supported by armored SUVs.

24:57.771 --> 24:58.938
When the helicopter lands
on the roof,

24:59.023 --> 25:00.356
James will let you grab him.

25:00.424 --> 25:03.026
Our guards will be able
to hold off the CIA long enough

25:03.093 --> 25:04.310
for me to get on board
and escape.

25:04.395 --> 25:05.778
Do your men know
what's about to happen?

25:05.863 --> 25:07.930
They've dedicated themselves
to this organization.

25:07.982 --> 25:11.617
They know the risks.

25:11.702 --> 25:13.536
Hello?

25:13.603 --> 25:15.872
What?

25:18.275 --> 25:21.444
Well, I want an update
as soon as you have it.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.798
There's a situation
at your mother's house.

25:25.883 --> 25:27.000
There's been a fire.

25:27.084 --> 25:28.801
When our security
went in to help,

25:28.886 --> 25:30.253
Fiona destroyed their vehicle

25:30.304 --> 25:32.121
and left with your mother
and your nephew.

25:32.172 --> 25:33.389
Michael, what is going on?

25:33.457 --> 25:34.807
I'm gonna find out.

25:38.795 --> 25:41.180
Okay, here we go.

25:41.265 --> 25:42.432
Mike, for God's sake,
I've been trying

25:42.483 --> 25:43.900
to get a hold of you--
it's about your mom.

25:43.967 --> 25:45.101
I heard, Sam.
What happened?

25:45.152 --> 25:46.352
Well, I'm not sure exactly.

25:46.437 --> 25:47.687
Fi called me
about ten minutes ago,

25:47.771 --> 25:49.072
and she was upset.

25:49.139 --> 25:50.406
I could barely understand
what she was saying.

25:50.474 --> 25:51.691
Where is she?

25:51.775 --> 25:53.109
Mike, this is kind of
a delicate situation.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.560
I'm gonna meet her
in about an hour.

25:54.611 --> 25:56.979
Why don't you meet me,
and we'll go together?

25:57.031 --> 25:59.699
I tried to talk to her, but she
needs to hear it from you.

26:03.653 --> 26:04.787
No, Sam, I can't.

26:04.838 --> 26:06.539
Look, Mike,
I know you're busy,

26:06.623 --> 26:08.424
but when you kicked us
off this job,

26:08.492 --> 26:09.959
Fi didn't take it too well.

26:10.010 --> 26:11.811
You got to talk to her.
No, I'm in the middle-

26:11.828 --> 26:14.347
Look, Mike,
make time, okay?

26:14.431 --> 26:17.100
'Cause she could be leaving the
country with your mom right now.

26:17.167 --> 26:20.336
We got to get in front of this--
just you, me, and Fi--

26:20.387 --> 26:22.805
'cause if somebody else goes in,
who knows what she'll do?

26:22.856 --> 26:24.507
I mean, when she gets
like this, Mike,

26:24.558 --> 26:27.276
things tend to go boom.

26:27.344 --> 26:28.778
All right,
where should I meet you?

26:28.845 --> 26:30.513
The old port bridge.

26:30.564 --> 26:32.365
Remember, Mike, alone.

26:32.449 --> 26:34.183
Okay.

26:34.234 --> 26:36.519
Michael, is Fiona
going to be a problem?

26:36.570 --> 26:38.530
It's gonna be fine.
Just focus on everything here.

26:38.572 --> 26:39.655
I'll be back soon.

26:39.706 --> 26:41.240
Why would she
attack our men? Why?

26:41.325 --> 26:42.708
I don't know.

26:42.793 --> 26:44.160
This plan is already
in motion.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.496
- It'll be fine! I just need--
- If she does anything--

26:46.547 --> 26:49.698
- Sonya, I'll handle it.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.740
Michael just arrived.
Is everything in place?

27:14.825 --> 27:17.527
Tasers charged, rubber bullets
loaded, sedatives ready.

27:17.578 --> 27:21.080
Mike's getting on that plane
one way or another.

27:23.417 --> 27:24.617
So where's Fi?

27:24.701 --> 27:26.402
She's across the bridge
on the island.

27:26.453 --> 27:28.754
Well, let's do this quick.
I got to get back.

27:28.839 --> 27:30.623
Mike, hang on a second.
Fi doesn't know you're coming.

27:30.707 --> 27:32.458
We should take my car,
so we don't spook her

27:32.543 --> 27:34.710
before we get a chance
to talk to her.

27:34.761 --> 27:37.246
Sound good?

27:47.808 --> 27:49.809
Okay, they're on the move.

28:03.207 --> 28:05.074
Where are we meeting Fi?

28:05.125 --> 28:07.326
Uh, she's in some mansion
that's under construction.

28:07.411 --> 28:10.913
She's camping out
at the boathouse there.

28:10.964 --> 28:14.133
- Why there?
- What do you mean?

28:14.218 --> 28:15.501
Well,
when she was running guns,

28:15.586 --> 28:17.253
she would never use
one of these small islands

28:17.304 --> 28:18.804
because there are
no escape routes.

28:18.889 --> 28:20.289
I don't know.

28:20.340 --> 28:22.892
Maybe she's planning
more hiding than escaping.

28:22.959 --> 28:25.895
When you've worked with
the same team for many years,

28:25.962 --> 28:29.182
you understand exactly
how each member operates.

28:29.266 --> 28:31.800
You know their strengths,
their weaknesses,

28:31.852 --> 28:34.270
and how they act
under pressure.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.939
Sam, I don't think
I should surprise Fi.

28:36.990 --> 28:39.609
Why don't you let me out here,
you go in alone,

28:39.660 --> 28:41.027
and tell her I want to talk?

28:41.111 --> 28:43.663
Mike, look, the sooner
we deal with this, the better.

28:43.747 --> 28:45.748
You also know
what it looks like

28:45.815 --> 28:48.317
when they're trying
to hide something from you.

28:48.368 --> 28:49.502
Stop the car.

28:49.586 --> 28:51.037
Mike, let's get
to the meeting.

28:51.121 --> 28:54.040
You want to see your mom, right?
Sam, I said stop the car!

28:56.293 --> 28:58.211
Sam! Sam!

29:04.668 --> 29:06.969
What the hell just happened?

29:07.020 --> 29:09.338
You tell me
what is going on here!

29:09.389 --> 29:10.940
Why the hell
are you lying to me?

29:11.007 --> 29:12.525
Who's lying to who, brother?

29:12.609 --> 29:13.809
We saw you, Mike.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.811
We tailed you to that marina.

29:15.862 --> 29:17.982
You're telling me on the phone
you haven't seen James,

29:18.014 --> 29:19.565
and I'm watching you shake hands
with the son of a bitch!

29:19.650 --> 29:21.651
No!
You don't understand, Sam!

29:21.702 --> 29:23.202
Yeah, you're damn right
I don't.

29:23.287 --> 29:24.654
You're lying to protect the guy

29:24.705 --> 29:25.871
you're supposed to be
taking down!

29:25.956 --> 29:27.573
You don't know everything!

29:27.658 --> 29:29.875
I am protecting you.
I am protecting everyone.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.495
You know what?
You keep telling yourself that,

29:32.546 --> 29:34.714
but I know
there's more to it than that.

29:34.798 --> 29:36.215
You're starting to believe
what he's doing.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.884
You're starting to believe
in what he's all about.

29:38.969 --> 29:41.804
Quick reminder--you're supposed
to be working for the CIA!

29:41.871 --> 29:45.057
The CIA hired Simon!

29:45.142 --> 29:47.843
They burned me, and they left me
out in the dark!

29:47.894 --> 29:49.378
They ruined my life!

29:49.429 --> 29:51.180
I don't owe them anything!

29:51.231 --> 29:53.015
Okay, the CIA
may not be perfect,

29:53.066 --> 29:54.433
but they got to answer
to somebody.

29:54.518 --> 29:56.485
Who does James answer to, huh?

29:56.553 --> 29:58.487
Nobody, 'cause he makes up
his own rules.

29:58.555 --> 30:00.406
What's wrong with that?

30:00.490 --> 30:02.575
Tell that to Nate.

30:05.395 --> 30:08.447
What did you say to me?

30:08.532 --> 30:12.285
Mike, the people
who murdered your brother,

30:12.369 --> 30:14.120
the people
who destroyed your life--

30:14.204 --> 30:16.205
they thought they were doing
good things too.

30:16.256 --> 30:18.624
How is your group any different?
That is not the same thing.

30:18.709 --> 30:20.960
This is different.
When I'm in--

30:22.596 --> 30:25.317
When you're what, Mike?

30:25.718 --> 30:27.852
Oh, Jesus.

30:27.937 --> 30:29.337
It's worse than I thought,
isn't it?

30:29.355 --> 30:31.275
You're not just helping them,
you're one of them!

30:31.307 --> 30:33.675
After today, I won't have
to follow orders anymore.

30:33.726 --> 30:34.943
I will be making them.

30:35.010 --> 30:36.695
- Jesus.
- The resources I'll have,

30:36.779 --> 30:40.232
the operatives that I will have
under my control--

30:40.316 --> 30:42.984
after today, I won't have
to let some bureaucrat

30:43.035 --> 30:44.569
decide what's worth
fighting for!

30:44.654 --> 30:46.988
I can do
what I think is right!

30:47.039 --> 30:51.025
And, Mike, what happens when
somebody gets in your way, huh?

30:51.077 --> 30:53.411
What happens then?

30:53.496 --> 30:56.164
I'm walking away, Sam.

30:58.884 --> 31:01.169
You're not going
anywhere, pal.

31:29.332 --> 31:31.166
Aah!

31:49.585 --> 31:52.137
Navy SEALs use their comfort
in the water

31:52.221 --> 31:55.273
to gain the upper hand.

31:55.358 --> 31:58.259
If an opponent panics,
then all a SEAL has to do

31:58.311 --> 31:59.811
is hold his breath

31:59.895 --> 32:04.265
and let oxygen deprivation
do its work...

32:04.317 --> 32:07.736
Which means the best way to
fight a Navy SEAL in the water

32:07.787 --> 32:10.955
is to force yourself
to be as calm as they are.

32:21.283 --> 32:24.285
Let them think they've won
and then make your move.

32:55.868 --> 32:57.168
Because we're friends

32:57.253 --> 32:58.920
and we've been through
so much together,

32:58.987 --> 33:01.122
I'm gonna let this is go...

33:01.173 --> 33:04.843
But you stay the hell
out of my way, Sam.

33:17.176 --> 33:18.677
It's about time.

33:18.728 --> 33:21.030
Everything's in place.
James is waiting.

33:21.114 --> 33:22.614
I'll make the call.

33:22.682 --> 33:24.066
Is Fiona going to be
a problem?

33:24.150 --> 33:26.035
- I took care of it.
- Are you sure?

33:26.119 --> 33:28.070
I need to know that this
isn't going to get in our way.

33:28.154 --> 33:29.488
You don't have
to worry about her.

33:29.539 --> 33:31.490
Michael,
Fiona is a liability.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.876
She can ruin everything.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.079
This is what I want,
and I will do what I have to.

33:40.032 --> 33:42.384
Make the call.

33:48.224 --> 33:50.709
- This is James.
- Everything's on schedule.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.361
Once you're close,
I'll let the CIA know.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.396
They won't make a move
until you're on the ground.

33:54.481 --> 33:56.381
Well, then we mustn't keep
them waiting.

33:56.433 --> 34:00.152
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
We'll be ready.

34:00.219 --> 34:02.604
Michael, do you realize
how far you've come?

34:02.689 --> 34:04.273
I'm proud of you.

34:04.357 --> 34:06.575
My people are in good hands.

34:08.328 --> 34:10.079
Let's get this bird
in the air.

34:10.163 --> 34:11.947
Roger that.

34:15.735 --> 34:18.170
Damn it!

34:18.237 --> 34:19.955
I should have been able
to grab him!

34:20.039 --> 34:21.255
It's not your fault, Sam.

34:21.341 --> 34:22.925
It doesn't matter.
It's too late.

34:23.009 --> 34:25.210
We should just get on that plane
and get the hell out of town.

34:25.261 --> 34:26.594
No.

34:26.679 --> 34:29.630
He still has the tracker on him.
We know where he is.

34:29.716 --> 34:31.132
If we can get to him,
then I can--

34:31.217 --> 34:32.551
Fi, this is Mike
we're talking about.

34:32.601 --> 34:33.851
He knows we're a threat now.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.771
There's no way we can catch him
by surprise.

34:35.855 --> 34:37.054
Well,
it's not gonna be easy.

34:37.107 --> 34:39.024
Try impossible.
He's with James now.

34:39.091 --> 34:41.360
Yeah, I know that, Sam!

34:41.427 --> 34:43.529
But if we don't stop him now,

34:43.596 --> 34:47.565
there won't be
a Michael left to save!

34:47.617 --> 34:50.152
What are we gonna do, Fi?

34:50.235 --> 34:52.987
Even if we could get him,
then what?

34:55.942 --> 34:59.545
I looked into his eyes, Fi.
He's lost.

35:02.632 --> 35:05.634
You think that's easy
for me to say?

35:05.718 --> 35:07.719
He's my best friend,
but there's nothing we can do.

35:07.787 --> 35:11.089
It's too late.

35:11.141 --> 35:13.842
You have all been
through so much together.

35:18.097 --> 35:21.967
Please, don't give up
on Michael...

35:22.018 --> 35:23.852
Not now.

35:30.660 --> 35:32.194
Okay, Mike's way out
in the Everglades.

35:32.278 --> 35:33.862
If this plan is gonna work,
we got to get there fast.

35:33.947 --> 35:37.115
- Whose car are we taking?
- You have to ask?

36:00.557 --> 36:03.275
It's time.

36:08.731 --> 36:09.982
Tell me
you got something, Westen.

36:10.033 --> 36:11.533
I can't talk long.

36:11.618 --> 36:14.620
We're at a satellite facility
7 miles west of Pearl Bay.

36:14.687 --> 36:17.289
James is inbound.
Mobilizing the teams.

36:17.356 --> 36:19.074
Your best approach
is from the west.

36:19.158 --> 36:21.159
I'll take James down
and bring him out to you.

36:21.211 --> 36:22.744
I got to go.
We'll be there soon.

36:22.829 --> 36:25.664
Good work, Michael.

36:25.715 --> 36:28.884
They're on their way.

36:33.890 --> 36:35.724
Hang a left up there.

36:38.061 --> 36:40.729
Okay, right turn.

36:40.813 --> 36:42.180
Another hard left here.

36:57.664 --> 36:58.914
Move! Move!

37:09.208 --> 37:11.076
Well, the tracker
says he's here.

37:11.127 --> 37:13.011
Do you see him?

37:15.748 --> 37:18.083
I got him.
He's on the roof...

37:18.134 --> 37:19.434
with Sonya.

37:19.519 --> 37:21.019
What the hell
are they doing up there?

37:21.087 --> 37:22.471
Well, it doesn't matter.
We need to get to him.

37:22.555 --> 37:23.689
That's not gonna be easy.

37:23.756 --> 37:24.690
There's guards
all over the place.

37:24.757 --> 37:26.058
All right, how about this?

37:26.109 --> 37:28.527
We split up, flank him
on both sides, surprise him,

37:28.594 --> 37:30.428
maybe we get lucky.
Or maybe we get dead.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.430
I don't think a firefight's
the way to go.

37:32.482 --> 37:35.100
Southeast corner--if we can
get to the back of the building,

37:35.151 --> 37:36.735
we only have to deal
with one guard.

37:36.786 --> 37:37.953
I like that better.

37:38.037 --> 37:39.621
How the hell are you gonna get
on the roof?

37:39.706 --> 37:43.041
One step at a time.
This is gonna work.

37:43.109 --> 37:45.711
It has to.

37:45.778 --> 37:48.380
Here comes James.
He's about five minutes out.

37:48.447 --> 37:49.881
Any sign of the CIA convoy?

37:49.949 --> 37:52.301
Our men out on the road said
they drove by two minutes ago.

37:52.385 --> 37:54.753
They'll be here right on time.
When James lands...

37:54.804 --> 37:57.589
I'll need to get on the
helicopter as fast as possible.

37:57.640 --> 38:00.559
We can only jam the CIA's radar
for a short window of time.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.895
Well, I guess
this is good-bye, for now.

38:03.963 --> 38:05.897
Sonya, this is Cooper
at the rear exit.

38:05.965 --> 38:08.734
I need to ask you about--

38:08.801 --> 38:11.636
Cooper?

38:11.688 --> 38:13.972
Cooper, come in.
What did you need?

38:15.658 --> 38:18.910
I'll go check,
make sure there's no problems.

38:20.413 --> 38:21.613
I did what you wanted.

38:21.664 --> 38:23.365
Can you get that gun
out of my face now?

38:23.449 --> 38:26.335
Thisthis--this gun?
Sure, yeah, let me just--

38:49.025 --> 38:50.525
- Fi.

38:52.829 --> 38:54.296
Michael.

38:54.848 --> 38:56.015
Fi, you can't be here!

38:56.099 --> 38:57.733
You have to go, now!

38:57.800 --> 38:59.151
Or what, Michael?

38:59.235 --> 39:01.186
Look, I told Sam to stay away.
You have to!

39:01.271 --> 39:03.155
You all have to stay away.
I'm trying to protect you.

39:03.239 --> 39:04.690
What about you?

39:04.774 --> 39:06.075
Who's gonna protect you

39:06.142 --> 39:07.693
from making the worst decision
of your life?

39:07.777 --> 39:10.195
You don't--
you don't understand.

39:10.280 --> 39:13.866
I-I've made my choice.
It's too late.

39:16.202 --> 39:17.819
Is it too late
for the Michael Westen

39:17.871 --> 39:20.506
I fell in love with...

39:20.590 --> 39:22.541
The man who knows
that what he's doing is wrong?

39:25.178 --> 39:26.095
James is coming.
You have to go!

39:26.162 --> 39:27.262
No, get--no!

39:27.330 --> 39:29.298
Fi!
You got to go!

39:29.349 --> 39:30.849
Get out of here, now!

39:34.054 --> 39:35.971
Sam told you that someday

39:36.022 --> 39:38.640
someone would threaten
this organization,

39:38.691 --> 39:42.677
and you would have
to make a choice.

39:42.729 --> 39:45.013
Well, that day has come,

39:45.065 --> 39:47.649
and that someone is me.

39:51.821 --> 39:53.405
Michael!

39:53.490 --> 39:55.190
What the hell
is she doing here?

39:55.241 --> 39:56.658
I thought you said
she wouldn't be a problem.

39:56.709 --> 39:58.077
Well, he was wrong!

39:58.161 --> 40:02.381
I will give you one chance
to leave, one chance!

40:02.465 --> 40:05.000
Turn and walk out
that door, now!

40:06.503 --> 40:10.672
You know, I think I prefer
the view up here.

40:10.723 --> 40:13.809
She needs
to be dealt with, now!

40:13.876 --> 40:15.844
- "Dealt with"?
- Yes, dealt with.

40:15.895 --> 40:19.214
What exactly
do you mean, Sonya?

40:19.265 --> 40:20.382
I'll show you.

40:20.433 --> 40:22.651
No, wait!
Wait. Wait.

40:22.718 --> 40:25.053
I told you that she was going
to destroy everything.

40:25.105 --> 40:27.523
We can't let that happen.

40:31.077 --> 40:32.277
I'll talk to her.

40:32.362 --> 40:35.280
I...

40:35.365 --> 40:36.748
I just need
to figure this out.

40:36.833 --> 40:38.584
There's nothing
to figure out, Michael!

40:38.668 --> 40:40.068
James is here.
I'll-I'll figure this out.

40:40.120 --> 40:43.672
The CIA is closing in.
We have to finish this now!

40:45.041 --> 40:48.677
You do what you think
is right.

40:48.744 --> 40:52.181
If this is what you want,

40:52.248 --> 40:55.551
the man I love is gone.

40:55.602 --> 40:58.887
Michael, think of all the good
things we could do together.

40:58.938 --> 41:00.856
Don't let her hold you back.

41:00.923 --> 41:02.975
You have to let go.

41:03.059 --> 41:05.110
You need to let her go!

41:07.814 --> 41:11.150
Michael...

41:11.234 --> 41:13.735
Look at me.

41:13.786 --> 41:15.487
Michael...

41:15.572 --> 41:18.540
Look at me!

41:18.608 --> 41:20.742
All right.

41:20.793 --> 41:23.612
If you won't do it, I will!
