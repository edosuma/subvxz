WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.672
( chatter on P.A. )

00:11.712 --> 00:13.314
What?

00:13.314 --> 00:16.684
I'm not parked
in two spots.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.386
Oh...

00:18.386 --> 00:19.753
come on, man.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.591
What?

00:30.964 --> 00:32.766
Lucky?
Not today.

00:32.766 --> 00:35.536
( sighs )

00:35.536 --> 00:37.004
( grunts )

00:37.004 --> 00:38.272
( clatters )

00:42.976 --> 00:44.945
( screams )

00:44.945 --> 00:47.948
( blows raspberry )

00:47.948 --> 00:52.620
Keys, keys.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.054
( yells )

00:55.423 --> 00:57.758
( groans )

00:57.758 --> 01:00.528
Oh.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.799
Uh, hello?

01:05.799 --> 01:08.569
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:08.569 --> 01:11.172
( screams )

01:11.172 --> 01:14.074
( theme music playing )

01:24.718 --> 01:26.454
You sure this is necessary?

01:26.454 --> 01:28.589
That thing almost burned down
Yosemite National Forest.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.226
Well, Jonas Salk had
to test his vaccine,
we have to test our tools.

01:32.226 --> 01:37.131
Jenkins, if you're making
brekkie, I will take some
tomato and avocado.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.333
( Jenkins chuckles )
Not an ordinary toaster,
Mr. Jones.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.435
This is the Toaster
of Albuquerque.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.138
I think I'm going to be using it
as our new artifact tester.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.873
What happened to our
old artifact tester?

01:45.873 --> 01:49.577
No, not a new artifact tester,
a tester of new artifacts.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.645
And our old
tester of artifacts?

01:51.645 --> 01:53.681
Our scanners
used to determine age

01:53.681 --> 01:55.849
by the breakdown of magic
within the artifact,

01:55.849 --> 01:57.418
akin to carbon dating.

01:57.418 --> 02:00.354
But with the ley lines dormant
and prophecy ended,

02:00.354 --> 02:03.791
we need new tools
to detect new magic.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.626
I understand completely.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.861
If I could still get
some avocado on mine,
just on the side...

02:07.861 --> 02:09.863
- Jenkins: It's not--
- I understand what
you're saying, Cassandra,

02:09.863 --> 02:12.533
okay, but I spent my whole life
hiding from who I really was.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.202
Now that I'm at peace with it,
I can't tell anybody?

02:14.202 --> 02:15.636
But that's the way
that it's always been.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.904
I don't understand
why it's bothering you now.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.439
You're not--
Jones, Jones, okay?

02:18.439 --> 02:21.175
The Super Bowl, yeah.
Somebody wins the Super Bowl,

02:21.175 --> 02:22.443
they throw 'em a parade.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.711
Sometimes we get toast.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.646
Guys, back when I
was in counterterrorism,

02:25.646 --> 02:27.581
we used to fight
catastrophe all the time.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.517
We couldn't talk about it.
Comes with the job.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.220
See, it's perfectly normal
to want recognition,

02:32.220 --> 02:33.787
but this is the job
we signed up for.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.857
- We don't get to be--
- Normal, exactly.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.259
You won't live
normal lives.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.461
You're not normal people.
You're Librarians.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.563
Flynn, what are you
doing in the mirror?

02:42.563 --> 02:45.366
Well, after we tether
to the Library,

02:45.366 --> 02:47.268
I'll be taking on
certain responsibilities

02:47.268 --> 02:48.669
that used to be
performed by Judson,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.438
namely surprising you
by popping up

02:50.438 --> 02:52.440
into mirrors,
TV screens, and windows.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.976
And I think I've finally...
mastered how to do it.

02:55.976 --> 02:59.780
Why-- why are you guys
upside down?

02:59.780 --> 03:03.251
Wait!
No normal lives,
not at all, not ever?

03:07.288 --> 03:11.091
( chuckles )
It's just now that I'm not
living with the constant fear

03:11.091 --> 03:13.026
of the brain tumor
killing me,

03:13.026 --> 03:16.530
I just thought I'd be able
to experience things
that normal people do.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.466
You have a higher
calling now,

03:18.466 --> 03:21.402
your life, your commitment
here in the Library.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.537
No relationships,
families...?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.506
- No friends?
- Friends? No.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.342
No, especially
not friends.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.210
Why are you
doing this?

03:30.210 --> 03:35.949
Because this is how
we'll communicate with
the team from afar.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.151
( glitching )

03:38.151 --> 03:40.888
( garbled dialogue )

03:40.888 --> 03:43.991
( laughs )
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this

03:43.991 --> 03:45.493
if it's the last thing I do.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.860
Wait, um, so why
can't we have friends?

03:46.860 --> 03:49.530
Because emotional ties
outside the Library

03:49.530 --> 03:51.699
cause chaos and distraction
and confusion.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.534
All right, well,
Thomas Aquinas said,

03:53.534 --> 03:54.868
"There is nothing
on this Earth

03:54.868 --> 03:57.705
more to be prized
than true friendship."

03:57.705 --> 03:59.907
Thomas Aquinas?
Thomas Aquinas was
never a Librarian.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.242
Thomas Aquinas barely
made the waiting list.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.714
Listen, guys, I know
what you're going through.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.049
It happened to me.

04:09.049 --> 04:12.019
There comes a point in time
in every Librarian's life

04:12.019 --> 04:15.523
when he has to deal
with the downside
of being a superhero.

04:15.523 --> 04:19.092
- Superhero?
- That is what we are,
in a way.

04:19.092 --> 04:23.297
We can do amazing things,
but we don't do normal things.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.966
It's like my old friend
and mentor Judson once said.

04:25.966 --> 04:31.439
He used to say to me,
"You have to think of yourself
as being celibate monks."

04:31.439 --> 04:33.407
Uh, but you're not.
You have Baird.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.875
- Doesn't count.
- What?

04:34.875 --> 04:39.112
What I mean is you, sweetie,
are from the Library,

04:39.112 --> 04:42.115
so you understand
the life in the way
that an outsider wouldn't.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.717
Well, I'm not
buying it, all right?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.519
As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna take Ezekiel

04:45.519 --> 04:48.021
and go see one of my friends,
Slayton, all right?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.758
- We're gonna
drink some beer.
- Ah, ah.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.460
We're gonna bet
on some ponies,

04:52.460 --> 04:54.728
like real people,
all right?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.464
You ready, Jones?

04:56.464 --> 04:57.998
I was born ready.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.232
Take off the hat.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.836
- But I was--
- Take off the hat.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.539
- I don't count?
- ( laughs ) Sweetie,
that's not what I--

05:05.539 --> 05:06.607
aah!

05:06.607 --> 05:09.410
This is what
I was looking for.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.985
Oh, look at this, huh?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.487
Excitement of the race.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.188
You can smell
the horse sweat.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.289
Nothing more pure.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.291
( whickers )

05:24.291 --> 05:25.325
It's not gonna bite.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.361
Maybe not.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.029
You don't have to
worry about me, mate.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.732
The 12 deadliest animals
in the world all come
from my hometown.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.801
Well, good, because
they can sense fear.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.906
( laughs ) Slayton,
how you doin', Bubba?

05:38.906 --> 05:40.140
Good, man.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.542
What are you doing here?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.244
What do you mean?
You invited me weeks ago.

05:44.244 --> 05:47.114
Oh, that's right, I did.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.117
Man, things
have been crazy.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.685
You bein' here
is the first good thing
to happen in a while.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.389
Well, this is my colleague,
Ezekiel Jones.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.391
You two work
on the pipeline together?

05:57.391 --> 06:00.160
No, we-- something
like that, yeah.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.762
Then maybe you
can explain this guy.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.631
He's one of
the smartest dudes I know.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.298
He's like
a walkin' library.

06:05.298 --> 06:09.202
But he doesn't want
to be any more than
an oil field roughneck.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.804
Hey.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.474
- Glad you're here, Jake.
- Thank you.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.908
Check this out.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.478
His name
is Slayton Star.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.415
You ever seen
anything this beautiful
in your life, Ezekiel?

06:21.415 --> 06:23.751
Uh, no.
No, no, no.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.553
Except
the Hope Diamond.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.421
Or a hand milled
multi-lock skeleton key.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.523
But, as far
as horses go, aces.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.091
He's a funny guy.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.926
Hey, man, remember
when I asked you
if you wanted

06:32.926 --> 06:35.295
to go in the horse
training business with me,
set up an outfit?

06:35.295 --> 06:36.797
- I do.
- Yeah.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.365
Looks like you're
doing well, though.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.834
Slayton Star's running
in the Grand Slam.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.136
Yeah.
Yeah, it was good
for a while, man.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.206
Ever since I got here,
dude, things have gone
from bad to worse.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.374
It's like I'm cursed
or something.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.811
The cards again, huh?

06:50.811 --> 06:53.814
Yeah, yeah, man.
I played a hand or two.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.616
I wasn't gonna do any more
than that, but, uh...

06:55.616 --> 06:56.750
Did you get caught up?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.052
No, man, this was different.

06:59.052 --> 07:03.123
It was unreal.
It was bad hand after bad hand.
It just kept coming.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.025
And now...

07:05.025 --> 07:06.727
no, no, no, no, no.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.196
- Step back.
- Come on, guys. Not now.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.998
( whinnies )

07:13.601 --> 07:16.604
I thought our agreement
was delivery after the stakes.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.807
Our deal was subject
to my whims, Mr. Slayton.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.109
Oh, Benny,
he's just so pretty.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.945
I like pretty things.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.982
You lost fair and square,
my friend.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.054
Don't do that, man.
Don't touch my friend.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.823
- Don't, Jake, don't.
- Don't touch my-- don't.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.357
Jake.

07:37.357 --> 07:38.959
It's okay, man.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.427
It's like he said.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.929
It was fair and square.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.432
Get the horse to my barn.

07:45.432 --> 07:48.135
Man:
Come on, now. All right.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.840
( horse snickers )

07:52.840 --> 07:54.441
( whinnies )

07:54.441 --> 07:57.177
No, baby, no.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.278
No.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.313
Hey, hey.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.949
This over a game of cards?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.751
It's like I was trying
to tell you, man.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.587
It started with the cards,
but then everything went wrong.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.789
It's the most salacious
cold streak in my life.

08:08.789 --> 08:13.460
Then the vet called,
water heater exploded,
got a letter from the IRS.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.696
I'm just thinking,
"Lord, what's next?"

08:15.696 --> 08:18.098
I mean, this can't all be
coincidence, right?

08:18.098 --> 08:22.069
Ahh!
Damn bee.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.504
It's some-- you know--

08:24.504 --> 08:26.473
hey, hey, hey, Slayton!

08:26.473 --> 08:27.908
- Slayton!
- He's in anaphylactic shock.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.244
Call 9-1-1!
Slayton! Slayton! Slayton!

08:31.244 --> 08:33.413
Come on.

08:33.413 --> 08:37.317
Slayton!

08:37.317 --> 08:39.152
Doc, how is he?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.421
Normally a sting like that
would be harmless.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.990
Mr. Slayton wasn't even
allergic to bees,

08:42.990 --> 08:44.992
but trace chemicals
in his shampoo

08:44.992 --> 08:47.060
and the diet soda
he drank today

08:47.060 --> 08:49.096
mixed with this particular
strain of bee venom

08:49.096 --> 08:51.264
to completely
shut down his system.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.100
What? What are
the odds on that?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.969
We're doing everything we can,
but if the necrosis spreads,

08:55.969 --> 08:59.740
we're talking permanent
organ damage or worse.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.975
- Prep Trauma One.
- Yes, Doctor.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.777
( groaning )

09:03.777 --> 09:05.946
Another million-to-one
freak accident.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.515
Wait, "Another million-to-one
freak accident?"

09:08.515 --> 09:11.118
And what are the odds
of 2 million-to-one
freak accidents?

09:11.118 --> 09:13.186
- Oh, it hurts.
- Okay.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.355
I'm betting that didn't happen
in a ho-hum fashion, either.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.624
- Or that.
- Man on P.A.:
All available personnel

09:16.624 --> 09:18.225
report to the ER stat.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.761
We have another case
of lightning trauma.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.830
( both grunting )

09:22.830 --> 09:25.699
Stone:
Wait, look at
that guy's shirt.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.434
Fortune Downs Race Track
and Casino.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.002
We just came from there.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.303
Racing form.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.571
Fortune Downs.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.674
One freak accident
is unfortunate.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.675
Two is unusual.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.377
Three, four, five...

09:37.377 --> 09:39.579
Magic.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.018
Baird:
Not exactly Churchill Downs.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.154
Stone:
Flynn said the place
is under new management.

09:47.154 --> 09:50.323
Are you sure your friend's
misfortune is magical?
You said he gambles.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.926
If it was just that, then no.
But there's the crazy bee sting.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.127
And all the weirdness
at the hospital.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.462
It all leads back here.

09:55.462 --> 09:58.598
Usually when there are compound
synchronic improbabilities,

09:58.598 --> 10:00.300
it indicates a singular force,

10:00.300 --> 10:02.202
often abnormal,
working willfully.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.237
What?

10:04.237 --> 10:07.708
A bunch of weird events
together? It's magic.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.880
- Here you go.
- Man: It's time for
the call to post.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.915
So this is a thing
that normal people

10:14.915 --> 10:16.850
with absolutely nothing
but time on their hands
do for fun?

10:16.850 --> 10:19.519
Ezekiel:
Uh, not all normal people.

10:19.519 --> 10:24.091
In 1911 to 1937, horseracing
was the most watched spectator
sport in America.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.493
Really?
I wasn't in America back then.
What was it like?

10:26.493 --> 10:28.662
Well, I tell you, Jones,
if I hadn't joined the Library,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.764
this is what I'd be doing.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.900
Training horses.
Hmm.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.435
All the fresh air,
excitement in the crowd.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.404
Nothing is better.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.906
( fanfare playing )

10:38.906 --> 10:41.942
- Oh, fun. TV.
- Ooh.

10:41.942 --> 10:45.746
Your dreams can come true
at Fortune Downs Stakes,

10:45.746 --> 10:48.682
the fourth leg
of horse racing's grand slam.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.651
Look at this.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.253
Most important piece of data

10:53.253 --> 10:55.823
is the horse's lifetime
in the money percentage.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.624
Unless you're going trifecta.

10:57.624 --> 11:02.362
Don't miss your chance
to become a winner...

11:02.362 --> 11:04.732
- like me.
- ( dings )

11:06.466 --> 11:09.069
Announcer:
Bowing down the stretch,
it's Gary's Golden Girl

11:09.069 --> 11:11.004
neck-and-neck with
Brandon Baller on the rail

11:11.004 --> 11:13.841
and Four Days In coming up
on the outside.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.009
It's going to be
a close call.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.111
And it's Gary's Golden Girl.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.749
( all groaning )

11:21.749 --> 11:23.851
Well, that was exciting...

11:23.851 --> 11:26.486
until it wasn't.
I'm gonna go check out
the casino.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.722
- Good idea.
- I'll go check
the gaming machines.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.158
What's wrong
with this picture?

11:31.158 --> 11:34.294
Crowd's not cheering.
Nobody in the money?

11:34.294 --> 11:37.197
A race with no winners?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.198
No more bets.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.447
- Red seven.
- ( players groaning )

11:54.447 --> 11:56.183
- The winner is red seven.
- Well, hello there.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.451
- Think you can change our luck?
- Oh, can I?

11:58.451 --> 12:01.989
- How do you play?
- You pick a number or a color
and cross your fingers.

12:01.989 --> 12:05.558
This time we're going
with my old football jersey.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.260
Here, give it a try.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.029
Oh. Okay.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.030
Just...

12:11.999 --> 12:13.767
Ooh, don't get too wild now.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.804
Well, well, admittedly,
it's not even odds,

12:16.804 --> 12:19.439
but at 47.4%,
it is your best chance
at winning.

12:19.439 --> 12:23.243
If you just put
it on one number,
your odds are 2.63%.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.879
- It's not great.
- You're a smart one.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.849
- Oh. ( chuckles )
- I'm not gonna bet against you.

12:31.885 --> 12:36.089
- ( players groan )
- Red five, the winner.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.091
The odds.

12:38.091 --> 12:42.462
Um, dealer,
I-- I'm gonna need
more of these.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.463
Please.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.840
You poor pigeons.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.950
Well, as one thief to another,
I believe I found my game.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.291
Announcer:
Full speed on the outside.
Jimmy Galavan giving...

13:11.291 --> 13:14.928
- ( all cheering )
- Come on! Go! Go!

13:14.928 --> 13:17.865
Announcer:
And at the finish,
it's Crendemous Queen.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.967
( all booing )

13:19.967 --> 13:23.370
A photo finish for place,
Erin's Breakdown in fourth.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.438
Nobody wins again.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.240
That's definitely not right.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.177
Okay, I'm willing to buy
your magical interference
theory,

13:30.177 --> 13:31.744
but who or what
is doing it?

13:31.744 --> 13:35.148
Could be a new artifact,
dormant ley line.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.418
Or someone taking advantage
of one of those things.

13:38.418 --> 13:42.389
I smell a rat.
Is that what you're saying?

13:42.389 --> 13:45.292
Close enough.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.094
Announcer:
Welcome to the winner's circle,

13:47.094 --> 13:49.596
Fortune Downs Stakes.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.531
Hey.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.102
That's the guy that stole
Slayton's horse right before
he got stung.

13:55.102 --> 13:58.972
So this guy owns the track
and the winning horse?

13:58.972 --> 14:03.076
Everybody loses but him.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.845
If it smells like a rat...

14:12.886 --> 14:15.855
I win again!

14:15.855 --> 14:18.558
Wow, nice run, partner.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.895
Benny Konopka.
That's me.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.530
I own the joint.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.298
I do love a cowboy,

14:25.298 --> 14:27.200
especially
one who's winning.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.769
All right, Roy Rogers,
let's see if your luck
still holds.

14:29.769 --> 14:33.640
- Whoa. You're a cowboy.
That's gonna be tough to beat.
- Woman: Nice, nice.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.976
- Dealer.
- ( players groaning )

14:35.976 --> 14:39.112
Geez, 21.
That's a tough break.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.149
Well, keep playing.
Maybe you too can be a winner.

14:42.149 --> 14:45.385
- Like me.
- Better luck next time, sugar.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.054
Come on, sweetheart.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.591
Hey, did you see that?
He straight up cooled the guy.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.728
It's like
he's stealing luck.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.431
He's stealing luck.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.268
I'm telling you my-- my--
my friend, Slayton, he invited
me here weeks ago.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.071
I bet you anything
it was before his luck
got stolen.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.506
But how did Mr. Winner's Circle
pull that off?

15:06.506 --> 15:08.708
- Like me.
- ( dings )

15:08.708 --> 15:11.278
My money's on
the pinkie ring.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.680
Well, then we better
go find our thief.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.681
Absolu--

15:19.752 --> 15:22.089
Come on, come on, come on,
black.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.157
- Red one.
- Oh, what the heck, man?

15:24.157 --> 15:27.227
That's red or green
21 spins in a row!

15:27.227 --> 15:29.262
21 spins and not a single
black number coming up?

15:29.262 --> 15:32.465
I mean, the odds of that are
2,097,152 to 1.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.168
That violates every law
of probability.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.037
I'm gonna try it again.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.272
Unless you got a way of figuring
out where that little ball
is going,

15:39.272 --> 15:42.142
you're gonna have to get lucky,
just like everybody else.

15:42.142 --> 15:47.580
You're right,
but I am not
like everyone else.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.988
This wheel,
it's off by 0.065 degrees.

15:54.988 --> 16:00.027
Factor in the applied torque
and the starting position
of the ball.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.137
- Red 18 the winner.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

16:10.137 --> 16:11.838
- Both: Yes! Yes! Yes!
- I did it! I did it!

16:11.838 --> 16:16.076
Well, well, isn't that
a little slice of wonderful,
huh?

16:16.076 --> 16:18.345
Benny Konopka.
That's me.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.447
- I own the joint.
- Like me.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.249
Well, why don't you make
yourself a bet?

16:22.249 --> 16:24.384
- Be somebody, kid.
- Don't mind if I do.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.420
Feel a hot streak
coming on.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.457
So sad when they rely
on luck.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.760
- Red three the winner.
- ( all cheering )

16:33.760 --> 16:38.065
Yes! Yes! Yes!
I did it! Boo-yah!

16:38.065 --> 16:41.268
( slot machines chirping )

16:48.308 --> 16:49.942
What the hell is he doing?

16:49.942 --> 16:51.144
What are you doing, Jones?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.046
Me? I'm winning.
That's what.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.514
( slot machine beeping )

16:54.514 --> 16:56.249
Really? 'Cause it kinda looks
like the opposite.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.484
No, no, no.
Listen,

16:57.484 --> 16:58.985
if I line up all
these machines in a row,

16:58.985 --> 16:59.986
- one of them has to--
- Jones!

16:59.986 --> 17:01.454
We don't have time for this.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.156
We know what the artifact is
and we need you to steal it.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.991
It's a pinkie ring
that steals your luck

17:04.991 --> 17:09.129
and turns you into a...

17:09.129 --> 17:11.331
- pathetic loser.
- Hmm? No. Me? No, no, no.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.266
I-- I'm not the guy that loses.
I'm the guy that wins.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.436
Listen to me, you can't win.
It's a machine.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.439
Yes! Yes, it's--
it's a machine!

17:19.439 --> 17:21.341
And-- and I know
how to handle machines.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.575
Do you have a hex wrench?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.477
( exasperated sigh )

17:26.813 --> 17:28.881
- Swiss army knife?
- That'll do.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.084
Cover me.

17:36.723 --> 17:41.027
All right, yes.
You're a machine.
( chuckles )

17:41.027 --> 17:42.529
- Hey.
- How you doing?

17:42.529 --> 17:45.898
( chuckles )
You cable,
you think you know me,

17:45.898 --> 17:47.767
you don't know me.
( chuckles )

17:47.767 --> 17:50.370
Okay, USB.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.706
Got it!

17:53.706 --> 17:55.475
( slot machine beeping )

17:57.777 --> 18:02.182
( laughing )
Don't you ever feel like
you can beat Ezekiel Jones.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.117
You feel better
about yourself now?

18:04.117 --> 18:05.385
I actually--
actually, I do.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.786
Great!
Let's go get that ring.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.088
Wait! Are we just gonna leave
the money there, guys?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.325
What's going on, Benny?

18:12.325 --> 18:15.862
I don't know!
We cooled her, I know we did.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.730
Oh! My! God!

18:17.730 --> 18:19.532
I know who you are,
and I know who you are.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.568
"Don't miss your chance
to be a winner like me."

18:21.568 --> 18:24.070
Very good.
Listen, we're in
a big hurry, okay? So...

18:24.070 --> 18:26.038
I hope you're not
in a hurry at all.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.107
- We are. Didn't I tell him we--
- Well, look, just in case
you're not in a hurry,

18:28.107 --> 18:30.977
I was just asking
if it's possible--
I promise I never do this--

18:30.977 --> 18:32.479
Can I please get your
autograph, please?

18:32.479 --> 18:33.846
It's just you guys are like
the Jay-Z and Beyoncé

18:33.846 --> 18:35.482
of the casino/racetrack
world.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.950
- Foreigners are awfully cute.
- Just make it quick, okay?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.787
- Will you please--
- To E, Z, oh, okay.
Never mind.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.356
Thank you so much. All right.
Here you are.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.292
- Thank you.
- Yeah, big thrill, okay.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.126
- Okay, listen, we'll--
- ( all cheering )

18:47.126 --> 18:49.362
- Oh, no! Okay, look--
- Yes!

18:49.362 --> 18:51.631
I know I cooled her.
I know I did. It didn't take.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.401
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.
My ring. My pinkie ring.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.669
- Where is it? What are you--
- Where's my pinkie ring?

19:02.074 --> 19:03.376
Whatcha doin'?

19:03.376 --> 19:06.446
Uh, just, uh,
concentrating, sir.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.448
- Team back yet?
- No, sir, not yet.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.350
But shouldn't you be with them?
I think they're on to something.

19:10.350 --> 19:14.187
No, no. I need
to spend some time here
in the nerve center.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.189
On the bridge.

19:16.189 --> 19:20.059
After I-- we tether
to the Library, this--

19:20.059 --> 19:22.329
that out there will be
my new domain forever.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.297
Getting pretty excited
about it.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.233
Forgive me if I sound
a little dubious, sir,

19:26.233 --> 19:28.935
but poppycock.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.603
Poppycock?

19:30.603 --> 19:33.072
Yes, your overexuberance,
bit of a giveaway,

19:33.072 --> 19:34.106
sounds a little more
like fear.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.075
( scoffs )
Of what?

19:36.075 --> 19:37.777
That if you leave,
you'll never return.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.913
Jenkins, your powers
of observation are usually
so astute.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.048
But I think
they're misplaced here.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.650
I simply want
to familiarize myself

19:43.650 --> 19:45.685
with the levers of power
Of the Library.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.555
Hmm. Oh, forgive me,
which I need to set a door
for the Colonel.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.490
- Oh, I can do that.
- Well, sir--

19:50.490 --> 19:53.125
I need to familiarize myself
with the levers of power
in the Library.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.894
Yeah, I don't know.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.796
- ( sighs )
- You sure this is where Jenkins
said he'd set the door?

19:56.796 --> 19:59.799
I'm sure.
Hang on, I'll call him.
And no service.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.835
Casinos are all dead zones.
You gotta keep the gamblers
gambling.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.137
Flynn:
I'll bet you wish you didn't
need a phone to communicate.

20:05.137 --> 20:09.476
( chuckles )

20:09.476 --> 20:11.511
( distorted )
I told you this was
so much better,

20:11.511 --> 20:13.946
and as you can see,
I've figured it out.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.383
( sighs )

20:16.383 --> 20:18.084
Where's Jenkins?
We need the door.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.853
He's making some minor repairs
to that back door right now.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.489
He'll have it up and running
in no time.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.357
Well, maybe a little time.
Little time.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.494
- We need a hot artifact check.
- Oh. Uh, yes.

20:27.494 --> 20:31.230
Uh, well, since someone, uh,
almost broke the globe

20:31.230 --> 20:33.366
by projecting on
its reflective base,

20:33.366 --> 20:35.034
we will need to field test
the item.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.369
Hold it up to the glass,
please.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.706
Uh, well, the cameo stone
looks like--

20:39.706 --> 20:42.342
It's the Roman goddess Fortuna,
the goddess of Luck.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.311
I think you're
on to something.

20:44.311 --> 20:47.146
Ah-ha. Now, so we'll need
some naphazaline,

20:47.146 --> 20:49.349
hydrochloride,
an ethanol solution,

20:49.349 --> 20:50.883
and a magnet.

20:52.619 --> 20:56.155
Do you have eye drops,
an ATM card, and a beer?

20:56.155 --> 20:57.624
Oh.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.796
Drop the stone in.

21:08.801 --> 21:09.802
Green.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.504
Is that good or bad?

21:11.504 --> 21:13.340
Mm, no.
Not till St. Patrick's Day,
but no magic, no.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.874
None?
Are you sure?

21:14.874 --> 21:16.743
Yeah, well, no.
It's not an exact science.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.411
Miss Cillian
could perfect it.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.779
By the way,
where's Miss Cillian?

21:21.681 --> 21:24.684
( all cheering )

21:26.786 --> 21:29.589
Benny, forget
about the ring. Look!

21:29.589 --> 21:32.892
Yes! Yes!
Come to mama.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.527
Do you realize
how much money we're losing?

21:34.527 --> 21:36.929
I can't even watch.
Deal with it, Benny.

21:36.929 --> 21:40.199
All right, boys.
We've obviously got
a crossroader here.

21:40.199 --> 21:41.468
Bring her down
to the counting room.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.769
It's time for a workout.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.337
And find my ring!

21:44.337 --> 21:46.072
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

21:49.075 --> 21:51.143
(grunts)
Whoa.

21:51.143 --> 21:55.548
( indistinct chatter )

21:55.548 --> 21:57.450
Where are they taking her?

21:57.450 --> 22:01.488
You take somebody
out of a casino like that,
someplace bad.

22:13.232 --> 22:16.335
All right.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.105
We always like to give
any kind of cheater

22:19.105 --> 22:20.507
a chance to come clean.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.309
We don't want to hurt you.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.577
You know that, don't you?

22:24.577 --> 22:27.146
So, what's your scam?

22:27.146 --> 22:29.549
No scam. Math.

22:29.549 --> 22:33.886
Math?
There's no math in roulette.
It's just numbers.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.656
You're a grifter,
and I want to know your play.

22:36.656 --> 22:41.060
Actually, there's math
in everything, so...

22:52.439 --> 22:55.542
What is that?
Is it a chainsaw?

22:55.542 --> 22:58.244
No.
It's a baritone sax.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.346
You ever hear
one of these things?
It's really annoying.

23:00.346 --> 23:04.851
Ugh. But it covers the noise
in case we gotta break
your fingers.

23:04.851 --> 23:09.121
There's something I need
to tell you.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.558
I'm a Librarian.

23:14.961 --> 23:18.498
( laughter )

23:18.498 --> 23:19.799
( exhales sharply )

23:19.799 --> 23:23.603
Why does anyone
even try that anymore?

23:23.603 --> 23:25.905
All right, that's enough.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.574
A Librarian, huh?

23:27.574 --> 23:30.777
All right,
what's it gonna be, huh?

23:30.777 --> 23:32.311
Truth?

23:32.311 --> 23:34.714
Or dare me to do
something terrible?

23:37.116 --> 23:39.118
( heart beating rapidly )

23:50.129 --> 23:53.500
Look, it's not like I'm some
fancy d-26 polygraph machine,

23:53.500 --> 23:54.934
more like a really good
analog one,

23:54.934 --> 23:55.835
but I can count to 181,

23:55.835 --> 23:57.570
which is your current
heart rate,

23:57.570 --> 23:59.271
which leads me to believe that
you're having a panic attack,

23:59.271 --> 24:03.710
so I'm guessing
that you're not
really a tough guy.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.913
- Yes, I am.
- Felicity : Enough!

24:09.649 --> 24:15.421
I've been waiting for you
for 2,700 years.

24:15.421 --> 24:18.725
Who sent you?
Jupiter?

24:18.725 --> 24:23.696
I think you're confusing me
with someone who's...
really old.

24:23.696 --> 24:27.500
This isn't Rome.
They don't revere witches
here in America.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.935
They burn them.

24:28.935 --> 24:31.303
But, no, actually they--
they don't-- not anymore.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.606
- I mean, they used to
years ago.
- Shut up, fool!

24:33.606 --> 24:36.408
Yes, Fortuna.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.946
Fortuna?
The Roman goddess of luck?

24:41.914 --> 24:45.652
I will ask you again,
did Jupiter send you?

24:45.652 --> 24:48.154
Or was it that goody-goody
Minerva?

24:48.154 --> 24:52.992
Jupiter, Minerva, Fortuna.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.628
No.

24:55.628 --> 25:00.066
Actually, it was Saturn.

25:00.066 --> 25:03.970
That bastard.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.138
Not him, not you,

25:06.138 --> 25:08.975
nobody is going to trap me
back in a statue.

25:08.975 --> 25:12.278
I am done with being
put on a pedestal.

25:12.278 --> 25:15.582
You don't know what it's like
standing up there.

25:15.582 --> 25:19.218
Half-naked men pawing at you,
throwing coins.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.089
- Or do you?
- No.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.090
Ew.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.704
Okay, so what do we know?

25:41.307 --> 25:42.909
It's not the ring,
it's her.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.276
Apparently she's
a Roman goddess.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.045
She's almost 3,000 years old.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.081
- She was stuck in a statue.
- Boom. Living artifact.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.618
Okay, so she's stealing
people's luck. How?

25:51.618 --> 25:55.021
Legend has it Fortuna
used to upset people's luck
by kissing them.

25:55.021 --> 25:58.190
What? So she has to go and kiss
everyone on the race track
and casino?

25:58.190 --> 26:01.193
- Girl gets around.
- The fourth leg of horse
racing's grand slam.

26:01.193 --> 26:04.964
- Don't miss your chance...
- That girl does.

26:04.964 --> 26:07.934
And I know just how
she's doing it. Watch.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.069
- There's the kiss.
- That's a magic kiss.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.171
It uses the electromagnetic
radiation of the screens.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.942
People are getting infected
with bad luck just looking
at her.

26:15.942 --> 26:19.946
Guys, small point,
but aren't we looking at her?

26:22.682 --> 26:25.685
We've got to save Cassandra
before they barbecue her.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.898
Hey!

26:43.335 --> 26:45.337
( both grunting )

26:47.640 --> 26:50.176
Wet floor.
How unlucky.

26:50.176 --> 26:53.179
( all grunting )

27:00.853 --> 27:04.791
Don't miss your chance
to become a winner...

27:04.791 --> 27:07.727
like me.
( dings )

27:07.727 --> 27:08.995
That's why they're immune.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.863
How come it's not
affecting you?

27:10.863 --> 27:13.532
Uh, I guess I broke the spell
when I hacked the machine.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.167
How the hell
do you hack a fight?

27:15.167 --> 27:17.069
We're trying
to hit these guys, right?

27:17.069 --> 27:19.772
Try not hitting them.
Just do it.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.713
Uh.
( grunts )

27:26.713 --> 27:29.882
- Yo!
- ...a winner...

27:29.882 --> 27:32.084
like me.
( dings )

27:32.084 --> 27:33.419
( grunts )

27:38.590 --> 27:40.359
( grunting )

27:43.562 --> 27:46.398
( groans, grunts )

27:52.338 --> 27:53.840
( grunts )

27:56.342 --> 27:58.477
Dang it.

27:58.477 --> 27:59.578
Hit Cassandra!

27:59.578 --> 28:00.713
- What?
- What?

28:00.713 --> 28:02.514
Punch Cassandra
in the face.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.616
Do it!
Hit her hard!

28:04.616 --> 28:09.221
Hit her! Hit her!
Punch her in the face!

28:09.221 --> 28:10.222
( grunts )

28:13.893 --> 28:16.495
- We beat the spell.
- Wait, the spell's broken?

28:16.495 --> 28:19.165
Uh, guys?
Um, guys?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.803
Cassandra:
No, Fortuna's goals
have nothing to do with money.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.805
She wants to be
a god again.

28:25.805 --> 28:29.608
I heard her say something
about being in the circle
for the bandwidth.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.879
She wants to be able to spread
her power outside the casino.

28:32.879 --> 28:36.315
She used the electromagnetic
waves from the screens...

28:36.315 --> 28:37.750
bandwidth.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.386
In the circle.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.988
( exhales sharply )

28:41.988 --> 28:45.624
Duh.

28:45.624 --> 28:47.960
( groaning )

28:50.729 --> 28:53.833
The circle is
the winner's circle.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.268
She's gonna throw a kiss
on live TV.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.604
The race is being broadcast
across the country.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.106
She's gonna steal
the luck of millions.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.241
Cassandra:
Think of the multiplier effect.

29:02.241 --> 29:05.677
And with life itself
just being a series
of genetic coincidences...

29:05.677 --> 29:07.113
We're lucky to be alive.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.981
And the absence of luck
is death.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.516
We have to stop her.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.452
Her kiss could wipe out
humanity.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.324
Escaped?

29:18.324 --> 29:20.927
Well, they said
that she had a lot of help.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.863
The entire coven
must have time-traveled.

29:23.863 --> 29:26.232
This has Saturn's
sickle-prints all over it.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.501
He is working with Jupiter
to try to stop me.

29:29.501 --> 29:30.937
Haters!

29:33.072 --> 29:35.674
You take that fortune
you've been squirreling away

29:35.674 --> 29:37.877
and hire more men,
bad men.

29:37.877 --> 29:41.848
Round up the entire coven
and this time,
burn them!

29:41.848 --> 29:43.916
Okay, you might want
to consider a rethink.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.651
Okay, we'll--
we'll consolidate our gains.

29:45.651 --> 29:50.089
Uh, we could invest, okay?
That's power in the real world.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.090
( grunts )

29:53.025 --> 29:55.061
Do you see
what they're doing to me?

29:55.061 --> 29:57.263
I will die before I go back
on a pedestal,

29:57.263 --> 30:01.333
but I will make you wish
that you had died first.

30:04.170 --> 30:07.874
If only we knew more.
What's her motivation?

30:07.874 --> 30:09.608
Flynn:
Funny you should ask.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.811
We have just come into
a very important piece
of information.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.114
As it turns out,
Jenkins was friends

30:15.114 --> 30:19.551
with a Second-Century Etruscan
holy man who told him--

30:19.551 --> 30:22.188
( distorted speaking )

30:22.188 --> 30:24.356
Flynn,
you're making us nuts.

30:24.356 --> 30:27.026
- Sorry.
- Jenkins: Colonel, down here.

30:28.294 --> 30:32.331
Yes, now, according to Walo,
Jupiter set up a competition

30:32.331 --> 30:36.035
between his four favorites:
Saturn, Mars, Minerva,
and Fortuna

30:36.035 --> 30:38.637
to see who would rule
over the affairs of mankind.

30:38.637 --> 30:42.374
Fortuna won and she declared
thenceforth that the world

30:42.374 --> 30:44.543
would be ruled by luck.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.713
No more choice or judgment
or self-determination.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.449
In other words,
utter chaos would ensue.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.752
Jupiter realized his mistake,
reneged on the deal,

30:53.752 --> 30:55.454
and demoted Fortuna.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.756
Jupiter transformed her
into a disembodied spirit,

30:57.756 --> 31:01.393
doomed for all time to exist
in the gambling halls
of humankind.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.862
As punishment for trying
to rule the world through luck,

31:03.862 --> 31:06.198
she is forced to exist
in the world's casinos.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.768
Wait, so Fortuna's big plan
is to deal death
and destruction?

31:09.768 --> 31:13.872
No, now her big plan is to try
to rule the world through
the carnage of luck.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.243
Which would include a lot
of death and destruction,
so yeah.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.878
So how did she
become a statue?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.981
A ley line runs right
underneath the race track.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.051
Somehow she figured out a way
to upload herself into
her own statue

31:25.051 --> 31:26.585
and take physical form again.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.921
What we don't know is how
the statue was reanimated.

31:28.921 --> 31:31.690
- Or how to
re-statue-ize her.
- Ahem.

31:31.690 --> 31:35.227
So the only way to stop her now
is to keep her off camera?

31:35.227 --> 31:37.796
Absolutely.
The broadcast is the key
to her scheme.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.165
Stop it
and you stop her.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.866
The race starts
in 45 minutes.

31:40.866 --> 31:42.668
We can do this.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.570
Flynn:
I wish I could be there.
I would be if I cou--

31:44.570 --> 31:48.407
Yes, but, uh, I better
get back to working on
the door,

31:48.407 --> 31:51.077
otherwise, hmm, you'll be
walking home from the Rockies.

31:51.077 --> 31:54.213
Flynn:
Signing off.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.949
So here's the plan.
There's 12 cameras around
the track.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.117
We'll split up
and disable three each.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.986
No cameras, no broadcast,
no kiss.

31:59.986 --> 32:02.488
- What if they're being guarded?
- No, Fortuna doesn't have
enough goons

32:02.488 --> 32:06.025
to guard them all.
There's more of us than there
are of--

32:06.025 --> 32:08.227
( indistinct chatter )

32:08.227 --> 32:10.029
Could have been
a little off on the math.

32:10.029 --> 32:12.164
What's this?

32:18.937 --> 32:21.373
It's not us.
( chuckles )

32:21.373 --> 32:24.910
Could have
a passing resemblance.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.245
( indistinct chatter )

32:26.245 --> 32:28.614
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down.

32:28.614 --> 32:32.484
Calm down. You don't get paid
if you tear them limb from limb.

32:32.484 --> 32:35.421
There's a very specific way
to do this.

32:35.421 --> 32:38.790
Ooh, did that truck
just back into a motorcycle?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.392
( indistinct chatter )

32:40.392 --> 32:42.961
Go! Go!

32:44.096 --> 32:46.198
Where'd they go?

32:46.198 --> 32:47.833
Get 'em!

32:47.833 --> 32:50.036
( indistinct shouting )

32:52.771 --> 32:54.773
In here.
Come on, this way. Hurry.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.575
Hurry.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.410
Guys, you gotta help me.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.012
Help you?
Give me one good reason

33:00.012 --> 33:01.447
why I shouldn't tear
your ear off right now.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.482
It does only take
seven pounds of pressure.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.451
Oh, please.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.486
I'm not who you think
I am, okay?

33:07.486 --> 33:09.588
I'm just a bookkeeper
with a gambling problem.

33:09.588 --> 33:13.792
Every day, I'd rub the statue
out front just praying
for a payday.

33:13.792 --> 33:17.329
One night, I rubbed the statue,
okay, and she comes to life.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.998
And I won and I won
and I won and I won.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.701
I won so much,
I wound up owning the place.

33:22.701 --> 33:26.004
All of those desperate people,
all of that magical thinking.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.240
It must have infused itself
into the statue.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.908
I made a deal
with a devil woman.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.044
And as long
as she's flesh and blood,

33:32.044 --> 33:34.413
I'm her servant.
I can't take it anymore.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.448
Honest to God,
you can have it all.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.450
( scoffs )
We don't want your money.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.951
Uh, we don't?

33:39.951 --> 33:42.821
Oh. We-- we don't.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.057
I hired those goons, okay?

33:45.057 --> 33:46.492
And if we don't hurry up,

33:46.492 --> 33:48.026
they're probably
already telling her

33:48.026 --> 33:49.395
that I've
double-crossed her.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.397
Help us take out
the cameras.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.733
No, it's too late.
They're-- they're too
heavily guarded.

33:54.733 --> 33:58.704
She's hired an army
of the most horrible people
in the world.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.406
Oh, what am I gonna do?

34:00.406 --> 34:03.041
All right, all right.
if we can't take out
the cameras,

34:03.041 --> 34:04.643
how do we stop the kiss?

34:06.412 --> 34:08.947
Think, Benny.

34:08.947 --> 34:12.751
Come on, think!

34:12.751 --> 34:16.688
Well, I'm not gonna hit you.

34:16.688 --> 34:19.825
No, but somebody has.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.664
That's one heck
of a backhand.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.400
It was her.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.103
Parts of her body
are turning into bronze.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.139
It's quite a knuckle duster.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.040
Wait, why is she turning
back to bronze?

34:35.040 --> 34:37.776
When did that happen?

34:37.776 --> 34:39.711
When you started winning.

34:39.711 --> 34:43.515
That's it. When Cassandra
broke the bad luck curse,

34:43.515 --> 34:46.152
she regained her good luck
back from Fortuna.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.953
She needs the luck
to stay alive.

34:47.953 --> 34:50.456
So we just need to help
other people beat
their bad luck,

34:50.456 --> 34:52.958
draining the life from her,
turning her back to all
statue-y.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.960
A mass curse buster.
So how do we do that?

34:54.960 --> 34:59.765
Okay, if we can get enough
people to do exactly what you
did at that table...

34:59.765 --> 35:03.169
but--
but you're the only you.

35:03.169 --> 35:06.004
- Thank you.
- Right, right.

35:06.004 --> 35:08.507
Um, how is it
that you beat luck?

35:08.507 --> 35:11.510
I mean, besides having
otherworldly talent, of course.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.345
Cheating.

35:15.147 --> 35:20.652
We'll secretly rig
the race track and casino
to cheat lady luck herself.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.555
I like it.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.392
Quisling!
That heap of fimus!

35:26.392 --> 35:28.560
Jupiter must have made him
a better deal.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.130
Forget about the race.
We go before the cameras now.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.901
Guys, the puckering is happening
ahead of schedule.

35:35.901 --> 35:40.539
The kiss is coming.
I repeat, the kiss
is coming now.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.511
Announcer:
Five minutes to post.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.247
All riders,
five minutes to post.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.581
Guys,
it's such an exciting day.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.583
I want you to see this
before you mount up.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.785
Come on, gather around.
Take a look.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.487
Check this out, homie.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.424
Sunglass company wants to give
you an endorsement.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.459
Hmm? Better than goggles.
Check 'em out.

36:00.459 --> 36:03.395
Don't miss your chance
to become a winner...

36:03.395 --> 36:07.799
- ( shimmering, dings )
- Like me.

36:07.799 --> 36:10.802
( indistinct chatter )

36:26.818 --> 36:28.820
( trumpet blaring )

36:33.359 --> 36:35.227
- Oh!
- Are you all right, ma'am?

36:35.227 --> 36:37.095
Keep moving!
Go secure the area.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.297
Come on!

36:39.531 --> 36:41.667
All right, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

36:41.667 --> 36:45.371
Ladies and gentlemen,
the machines will be fixed
in just a moment, okay?

36:45.371 --> 36:47.205
Okay? Here-- here we go
right here.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.840
Where have you been, man?
I've been stalling as long
as I can.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.809
All right, cool your jets.
I was in the casino.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.011
Those rigged gaming machines
don't rig themselves.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.647
You got your card?

36:55.647 --> 36:57.416
( beeping )

37:01.820 --> 37:03.221
All right, I'm in.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.056
All right, roll right up,
roll right up,

37:05.056 --> 37:06.492
and place your bets.

37:06.492 --> 37:09.495
( indistinct chatter )

37:09.495 --> 37:11.930
Just like that,
everybody's a winner.

37:11.930 --> 37:15.367
Announcer:
And the horses are approaching
the starting gate.

37:15.367 --> 37:18.169
( indistinct chatter )

37:18.169 --> 37:21.206
Over here!
( grunts )

37:21.206 --> 37:24.510
Yes, over--
I command you.

37:24.510 --> 37:28.614
Right here.
Make him point the camera at me.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.717
Announcer:
It's time for the call
to post.

37:31.717 --> 37:35.287
- Fortuna: Make him do it.
- Go on, get outta here!
Move it! Move!

37:35.287 --> 37:39.358
Lady, you got a lot of brass.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.493
- You're too late.
- Announcer: They're all tight.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.695
- ( bell ringing )
- And they're off!

37:43.695 --> 37:45.397
Hey, what the?

37:45.397 --> 37:47.499
The horses are just wandering
around the gate.

37:47.499 --> 37:52.771
Wait, Metro Randy
in the number seven
red silks is up and running!

37:52.771 --> 37:55.674
Looks like your luck's
running out.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.743
I don't need luck.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.345
I am luck.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.347
- ( clangs )
- Ow!

38:01.347 --> 38:03.682
- ( clangs )
- ( grunts )

38:03.682 --> 38:06.051
Turn the camera to me,
you idiot!

38:06.051 --> 38:07.319
( both grunting )

38:07.319 --> 38:08.687
What the hell?

38:08.687 --> 38:10.622
I bet the two horse,
my ticket says seven.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.358
- So does mine.
- Mine say seven, too.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.225
Announcer: It's still only
the number seven horse

38:14.225 --> 38:16.227
all by himself
on the back stretch.

38:16.227 --> 38:20.399
- And she's winning.
- Every ticket is seven.
What are the odds of that?

38:23.535 --> 38:25.504
Red, black, red, black, red.

38:28.106 --> 38:31.076
14.

38:31.076 --> 38:34.680
Put your money
on red 14.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.449
- ( indistinct chatter )
- No more bets. No more bets.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.150
Announcer:
Finally the number four
horse...

38:39.150 --> 38:42.220
Fortuna:
Turn it to me.
Hurry up.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.722
You idiot.

38:45.524 --> 38:49.795
Announcer:
Lady Dionne is against the rail
giving everything she has.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.297
- Right now!
- It's Lady Dionne
and lucky number seven.

38:52.297 --> 38:54.566
Start filming!
You only have to turn it on!

38:54.566 --> 38:56.635
Lucky number seven
still holding on!

38:56.635 --> 38:57.636
No.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.941
( all cheering )

39:07.979 --> 39:10.248
Announcer: It's Metro Randy,
lucky number seven still
in the lead...

39:10.248 --> 39:13.385
- Fortuna, kiss off.
- As they charge over
the stretch run.

39:13.385 --> 39:15.053
- No!
- It's going to be close.

39:15.053 --> 39:18.790
And it's Metro Randy,
number seven by a nose.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.793
( all cheering )

39:34.239 --> 39:35.474
( grunting )

39:35.474 --> 39:37.676
I'm just saying
I feel sorry for her.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.911
I mean, she turned out bad,
but she didn't start off
that way.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.880
Even the Pantheon
has a glass ceiling.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.682
Yeah, but there's bad,
and then there's
destroy-the-world bad.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.584
At that point, it doesn't even
matter what your reasons are.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.887
Oh, I don't know.
A powerful woman obvious threat
to the power structure.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.957
Just imagine.

39:51.957 --> 39:56.562
Yes, well, I don't think
the statue should be anywhere
near the Toaster.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.697
I will take it down to storage.

39:58.697 --> 40:01.933
It is the responsible thing
to do.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.407
- I don't count?
- You count. You count.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.678
And then, literally,

40:12.678 --> 40:14.680
five minutes after
the race was over,

40:14.680 --> 40:16.615
the doctor said I started
responding to the antibiotics.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.551
- That's crazy, isn't it?
- Yeah, man.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.352
And when I got home,

40:21.352 --> 40:24.956
I found out Benny Konopka
had signed her back over to me.

40:26.458 --> 40:30.829
( chuckles )
And how do you explain that?

40:30.829 --> 40:33.198
But, you know,
it made me think.

40:33.198 --> 40:36.001
You only get
one shot at life.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.236
Jake, stop
throwing yours away, man.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.738
You got
so much potential, man.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.039
You could be so much more.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.008
Slayton, what happened here
at the race track,

40:43.008 --> 40:45.544
what happened with you,
that wasn't just luck.

40:45.544 --> 40:48.514
No.
What was it then?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.488
Payback.
Hmm?

40:56.488 --> 40:59.024
- ( scoffs )
- You know why? 'Cause you're
one of the good guys.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.959
( laughing )

41:00.959 --> 41:03.328
So are you, man.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.130
I mean what I said, Jake.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.433
You could be so much more.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.636
Yeah.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.742
I think I'm gonna
keep doing what I'm doing.

41:16.742 --> 41:18.510
- ( chuckles )
- Hmm?

41:18.510 --> 41:21.647
- Yeah.
- It's working for me.

41:44.736 --> 41:49.641
( music playing )
