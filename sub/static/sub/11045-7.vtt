WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:06.374
**

00:06.407 --> 00:07.541
Hey! Rainbow Dash!

00:10.078 --> 00:11.779
Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up?

00:11.812 --> 00:14.248
The Rainbow Dash fan
club just decided

00:14.282 --> 00:16.584
everypony's coming to see you
when the Wonderbolts' new tour

00:16.617 --> 00:17.851
comes through Ponyville!

00:17.885 --> 00:20.521
Well, it's great that you guys
are going to the show, Scoot,

00:20.554 --> 00:23.124
but I won't actually
be performing in it.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.425
Reservists aren't
in the show

00:24.458 --> 00:27.228
unless one of the real
Wonderbolts can't fly.

00:27.261 --> 00:30.098
I'll probably be working
crowd control or something.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.101
You're still gonna be
wearing a Wonderbolts uniform

00:33.134 --> 00:34.368
though, right?

00:34.402 --> 00:35.836
A Reservist one, yeah.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.372
Hmm. That's good
enough for me!

00:38.406 --> 00:39.373
[whoosh]

00:39.407 --> 00:40.508
[gasp]

00:40.541 --> 00:43.577
[whoosh]

00:52.786 --> 00:54.522
Whoa!

00:54.555 --> 00:56.790
Rainbow Dash! Glad
we found you.

00:56.824 --> 01:01.195
We need you in the show when
we get to Ponyville. Flying.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.297
But she's only
in the Reserves!

01:03.331 --> 01:04.865
Not anymore, kid.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.201
[gasp] You mean...

01:07.235 --> 01:09.203
[gasp]

01:09.237 --> 01:14.308
Rainbow Dash! You're finally
a full-fledged Wonderbolt!

01:14.342 --> 01:17.578
Woo-hoo! [laugh] Yeah!
Rainbow Dash! Woo!

01:19.580 --> 01:21.649
[chuckle] What
she said.

01:27.655 --> 01:31.459
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:31.492 --> 01:33.494
* Aaaahhh

01:33.527 --> 01:35.696
* My little Pony

01:35.729 --> 01:37.731
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:37.765 --> 01:39.500
* My Little Pony

01:39.533 --> 01:42.370
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:42.403 --> 01:44.138
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:44.172 --> 01:46.307
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:46.340 --> 01:48.409
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:48.442 --> 01:50.378
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:50.411 --> 01:52.580
* To have my little pony

01:52.613 --> 01:55.883
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:55.916 --> 01:58.619
**

02:08.562 --> 02:11.399
Uh, anypony see my wing
balm? I don't wanna be stiff

02:11.432 --> 02:14.168
when I show up at
Wonderbolt headquarters.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.203
Got it.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.539
Do you have time to tell us
what happened, Rainbow Dash?

02:18.572 --> 02:21.209
Ooo yes, we must
know every detail!

02:21.242 --> 02:23.544
Start from when you were
a foal and you first knew

02:23.577 --> 02:26.847
your destiny was to
become a Wonderbolt!

02:26.880 --> 02:29.617
[chuckle] Well, not
much to tell, really.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.420
Spitfire told me the
Wonderbolts need me

02:32.453 --> 02:33.921
to go on tour with them.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.789
That's really great.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.759
I know how long you've been
waiting for a spot to open up.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.696
Yeah, Fire Streak decided to
retire and teach full-time.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.499
Cloudsdale Flight School will
probably be churning out

02:45.533 --> 02:46.800
Wonderbolts with him there.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.937
But guess who was at the
top of the Reserve list?

02:49.970 --> 02:53.207
Ooh ooh! I know! Pick me!

02:53.241 --> 02:54.942
So what do you
do now, Dashie?

02:54.975 --> 02:57.378
I have to report to
Wonderbolts Headquarters

02:57.411 --> 03:00.548
this afternoon. It's only
two days till tour starts

03:00.581 --> 03:02.283
and I need to learn
the routine.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.218
You're leaving already? [gasp]

03:04.252 --> 03:06.587
But we barely started your
congratulation party!

03:06.620 --> 03:09.357
I haven't even thought about
your going away party yet.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.226
Pinkie, I'm not
leaving Ponyville.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.295
I just have to
train for this show.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.264
I hope everything
goes well.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.399
It sounds like an
awful lot of pressure,

03:18.432 --> 03:21.335
having to learn
everything so quickly.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.371
Yeah, good luck, Dash!

03:23.404 --> 03:27.308
Luck? [chuckle] Save that
for the rest of the team.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.478
Now that my awesomeness has
finally been recognized,

03:30.511 --> 03:32.346
the other Wonderbolts
will have to keep up

03:32.380 --> 03:34.548
or eat my cloud-trail.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.385
Everypony knows you're a
great flier, Rainbow Dash,

03:37.418 --> 03:39.353
but so are the rest
of the Wonderbolts.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.490
It might be more
challenging than you think.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.991
[sigh] You're right.

03:44.024 --> 03:47.561
I mean, do I show up
wearing sunglasses or not?

03:47.595 --> 03:49.563
Sunglasses are
automatically cool,

03:49.597 --> 03:51.899
but anypony can
put them on. [sigh]

03:51.932 --> 03:53.601
Maybe I'd stand out
more if I didn't.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.408
Team briefings are
every morning at--

04:00.441 --> 04:01.675
--oh seven twenty.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.444
Because there were twenty
ponies in the original

04:03.477 --> 04:05.479
EUP Guard that became
the Wonderbolts.

04:05.513 --> 04:08.416
Right. And I know you've
seen the Academy bunks,

04:08.449 --> 04:10.684
but these are the official
Wonderbolts' barracks--

04:10.718 --> 04:12.986
--built by Admiral
Fairweather himself!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.055
[thud]

04:15.088 --> 04:17.691
Don't forget rule
number one, newbie:

04:17.725 --> 04:20.994
always check both ways
before crossing the runway.

04:28.402 --> 04:32.072
Uh sure, but nopony
else is here!

04:32.105 --> 04:34.308
They will be. And most
of the Wonderbolts

04:34.342 --> 04:37.010
like to make a flashy
entrance, so stay alert.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.579
Right. No problem.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.885
Whoa! Is that
General Flash's cap?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.721
And the original crest with
the Wonderbolts motto on it.

04:47.755 --> 04:51.959
"Altius volantis."
"Soaring higher!"

04:51.992 --> 04:57.398
WOW! [gasp] I mean... cool.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.700
OK, newbie, we've got
a show in two days,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.435
which means you've gotta
hustle your haunches

05:01.469 --> 05:02.903
to learn this routine.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.072
You've got five minutes to
get dressed and get outside

05:05.105 --> 05:07.040
to meet the rest of the team.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.942
Yes, ma'am! I'll have
all the moves down

05:08.976 --> 05:10.478
by the end of the day.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.979
Let's hope so. We're
all expecting you

05:12.012 --> 05:13.881
to make quite
an impression.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.015
[whoosh]

05:20.087 --> 05:24.392
Lookin' good! OK, you're about
to take your first flight

05:24.425 --> 05:30.063
as an actual Wonderbolt.
[sigh] No pressure. [sigh]

05:30.097 --> 05:33.467
Just gotta go out there and
knock 'em off their hooves.

05:33.501 --> 05:36.504
OK, Wonderbolts, get
ready to meet your most

05:36.537 --> 05:38.005
awesome member ever!

05:43.444 --> 05:46.714
[excited chatter]

05:46.747 --> 05:48.382
Hey! Look out!

05:48.416 --> 05:49.417
Huh?

05:50.584 --> 05:51.585
Whoa!

05:51.619 --> 05:52.620
[crash]

05:57.124 --> 05:59.527
[groan]

06:01.862 --> 06:04.432
[laughter]

06:04.465 --> 06:08.168
Whoa! Most awesome
entrance by a newbie ever!

06:08.201 --> 06:10.070
Are you OK, Rainbow Dash?

06:10.103 --> 06:12.740
More like Rainbow Crash!

06:12.773 --> 06:15.676
[laughter]

06:17.745 --> 06:21.148
OK, flight school. Get
ready for Rainbow Dash!

06:23.484 --> 06:26.153
Whooooooooa!

06:26.186 --> 06:27.087
[grunt]

06:28.556 --> 06:29.757
[crash]

06:31.992 --> 06:33.961
More like Rainbow Crash!

06:33.994 --> 06:36.063
[laughter]

06:36.096 --> 06:43.103
Rainbow Crash, Rainbow Crash,
Rainbow Crash, Rainbow Crash!

06:46.607 --> 06:49.176
Hey! You guys buzzed
me on purpose!

06:49.209 --> 06:52.880
Not quite. You forgot
rule number one, newbie.

06:52.913 --> 06:57.485
"Always check both ways
before crossing the runway."

06:57.518 --> 07:00.921
Yeah, well, I was just...
testing you guys.

07:00.954 --> 07:06.460
[laughter] Yeah, right.

07:06.494 --> 07:09.763
All right, nopony got hurt
and we've got a lot to do,

07:09.797 --> 07:12.766
so let's forget about
this and get flying.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.970
Classic rookie move, Rainbow
Crash. That was amazing.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.944
[whoosh]

07:23.977 --> 07:25.879
Higher, Crash! You're
breaking formation!

07:32.686 --> 07:34.187
Check your nine, Crash!

07:40.027 --> 07:42.563
Tighter, Crash! Get in there!

07:42.596 --> 07:45.966
[growl] My name's not Crash!

07:45.999 --> 07:48.235
[grunt] Whoah!

07:49.903 --> 07:51.539
Huh! Coulda fooled me!

07:57.978 --> 08:00.213
Hey Crash, I know it
was a tough day today,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.783
but don't worry, you'll
get the hang of it.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.820
Tough day? Please. If I can
pull off a Sonic Rainboom,

08:06.854 --> 08:10.524
I can learn this routine. I'll
have it down cold tomorrow.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.126
Probably even come up with
a couple of improvements.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.062
Rainbow Dash, over here.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.296
Yes, ma'am?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.665
I'm glad you're
still here.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.667
Oh yeah? Did you want
some ideas on how

08:19.700 --> 08:22.069
to make the show
extra awesome?

08:22.102 --> 08:24.838
Not quite. I know you've
been a Reservist for a while,

08:24.872 --> 08:26.807
but the Bolts have a
few of their own rules

08:26.840 --> 08:27.975
you might not know about.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.781
Like worst flier
of the day

08:33.814 --> 08:36.149
has to clean up the
whole compound.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.751
Better get to it, Crash.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.222
[sigh] My name's not Crash.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.931
**

08:50.964 --> 08:52.800
Boom!

08:52.833 --> 08:54.902
Surprise!

08:54.935 --> 08:56.203
What?

08:56.236 --> 09:00.007
Hooray, Rainbow Dash!
Our favorite Wonderbolt!

09:02.042 --> 09:04.211
We know you're probably
tired, Rainbow Dash,

09:04.244 --> 09:06.880
but Pinkie wanted to
throw you a real party.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.349
Your Best Day EVER party!

09:09.382 --> 09:13.654
[chuckle] Yeah. It was
something, all right.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.756
Well, we can't wait
to hear all about it.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.759
[chuckle] And I'd love to
tell you. I really would.

09:18.792 --> 09:22.996
But I'm pretty beat.
[chuckle] [fake yawn]

09:23.030 --> 09:25.999
You know, from all the
excitement of my big day.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.672
Um, is something
wrong, Rainbow Dash?

09:31.705 --> 09:34.207
What could be wrong? I'm
finally a Wonderbolt,

09:34.241 --> 09:38.278
which means everything has to
be totally perfectly awesome.

09:38.311 --> 09:42.716
Oh no, something is wrong.
What happened, darling?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.652
I told you, it's nothing.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.788
I mean, maybe some of the
Wonderbolts started calling me

09:47.821 --> 09:49.623
"Rainbow Crash".

09:49.657 --> 09:52.192
Oh no! Isn't that the
same terrible nickname

09:52.225 --> 09:54.662
those bullies in flight
school used to call you?

09:56.396 --> 09:58.298
Why would they call you that?

09:58.331 --> 10:02.035
Well, I, kinda, sorta
fell into a garbage can.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.370
Ugh!

10:03.403 --> 10:05.238
Well, look at the
bright side!

10:05.272 --> 10:07.808
At least they didn't
call you Rainbow Trash!

10:07.841 --> 10:10.177
So you started off
on the wrong hoof.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.780
I bet every new Wonderbolt
has a tough first day.

10:12.813 --> 10:13.914
Um-hum!

10:13.947 --> 10:16.884
What you need is to find a
positive way to stand out.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.186
As soon as you're known
for something else,

10:19.219 --> 10:21.354
that nasty old nickname
will be forgotten.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.923
Rarity's right.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.125
Why don't you think of the
Wonderbolts like us?

10:25.158 --> 10:28.829
We're a team, but we all stand
out in different ways.

10:29.830 --> 10:34.301
That's it! I'm gonna stand out
in a different way.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.870
Just like you guys!

10:36.904 --> 10:40.240
Goodbye, Rainbow Crash,
hello, Captain Awesome!

10:46.914 --> 10:48.081
Good morning, everypony!

10:48.115 --> 10:51.284
Who's ready for a fantastic day
of flying? I know I am!

10:51.318 --> 10:52.552
I just couldn't be more excited

10:52.585 --> 10:55.188
for the big show tomorrow. Are
you guys excited? I'm excited!

10:55.222 --> 10:56.690
Actually, I'm always excited!

10:56.724 --> 10:59.126
Some ponies even call
me "Dynamic Dash"

10:59.159 --> 11:01.829
because I'm so full of
energy all the time!

11:02.429 --> 11:05.766
Uh, Wonderbolts don't
get excited, Crash.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.769
You gotta keep a level
head to fly the way we do.

11:09.236 --> 11:13.841
[sigh] [Southern accent]
Well, of course I know that!

11:13.874 --> 11:17.878
But the truth of the matter is,
you should be excited.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.948
It's the dream of near every
little Pegasus pony

11:20.981 --> 11:23.316
to grow up and fly
with the Wonderbolts

11:23.350 --> 11:26.019
and here you all are doing it.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.454
So are you.

11:27.487 --> 11:31.058
True. Go ahead and call me
"Forthright Filly"

11:31.091 --> 11:35.729
if you want, but she-ucks, I
like to tell it like it is.

11:35.763 --> 11:38.465
And I believe a pony oughta
appreciate hard work

11:38.498 --> 11:41.334
paying off like this because
being a Wonderbolt

11:41.368 --> 11:43.804
is somethin' special.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.404
We know.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.372
[door closes]

11:54.982 --> 11:57.417
You know, I was just reading
about how dihedral wing angles

11:57.450 --> 11:59.853
can help increase stability
in banking turns.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.288
It made me think that
pre-flight checklists

12:01.321 --> 12:03.423
could really help
increase our efficiency,

12:03.456 --> 12:05.258
so I went ahead and made
them for everypony.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.130
I'm always finding so much
interesting information

12:10.163 --> 12:12.800
in books. In fact, a lot of
ponies call me

12:12.833 --> 12:14.802
"Reading Rainboom."

12:14.835 --> 12:17.270
We all know how
wings work, newbie

12:17.304 --> 12:19.406
and we already have checklists!

12:19.439 --> 12:21.341
Now get off the runway!

12:24.978 --> 12:27.480
[sweet shy voice] I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to help

12:27.514 --> 12:31.018
because I care about all of the
Wonderbolts oh so much.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.854
Yesiree, just call
me "Care Mare."

12:36.256 --> 12:39.359
Um, but if you're busy now, I
can just come back later.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.063
Or, you know, not at all.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.969
OK.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.541
I must tell you how much I
just love these uniforms!

12:54.574 --> 12:57.310
Why, ever since I was a foal,
I've admired the mixture

12:57.344 --> 12:59.847
of bold lines and
classic contours.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.850
They don't call me "Rainbow
Fash" for nothing!

13:02.883 --> 13:05.285
Uh...

13:05.318 --> 13:07.354
The "Fash" is for fashion.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.255
Crash!

13:09.957 --> 13:11.324
I'm not sure why you're
acting like this,

13:11.358 --> 13:13.560
but you need to stop.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.363
I was just, you know,
trying to show everypony

13:16.396 --> 13:19.332
all the awesome ways I can
contribute to the Bolts.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.468
I know you're excited to find
your place on the team,

13:21.501 --> 13:24.204
but just focus on the
routine for now, OK?

13:24.237 --> 13:25.038
Yes, ma'am.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.107
Maybe this will
help motivate you.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.847
"Crash?"

13:33.881 --> 13:36.016
Couldn't you just put
my regular name on it?

13:36.049 --> 13:37.584
That's not how it
works around here.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.921
We all have our nicknames on our
jackets. Right, Clipper?

13:40.954 --> 13:41.889
Clipper?

13:41.922 --> 13:43.056
Right, boss!

13:45.158 --> 13:48.161
Now it's official. Welcome to
the Wonderbolts, Crash!

13:48.195 --> 13:49.596
[laugh]

13:51.464 --> 13:53.366
If I don't come up with
something unforgettable

13:53.400 --> 13:54.935
to add to the routine,

13:54.968 --> 13:58.238
I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash
for the rest of my life.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.307
[slam]

14:02.175 --> 14:09.149
**

14:10.951 --> 14:13.253
This is gonna be so amazing!

14:13.286 --> 14:15.889
I know! I'm almost as
excited as Pinkie Pie!

14:15.923 --> 14:18.325
I can't wait to see Rainbow
Dash's first performance

14:18.358 --> 14:20.894
as an honest to
goodness Wonderbolt!

14:20.928 --> 14:22.262
I hope there's
cotton candy!

14:24.597 --> 14:27.134
We should all remember
to be extra supportive

14:27.167 --> 14:29.102
for Rainbow Dash, too.

14:29.136 --> 14:32.239
Excellent point. It's simply
dreadful that she's had

14:32.272 --> 14:35.242
such a rough start after
finally achieving her dream.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.510
Rainbow Dash is a pretty
resilient pony.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.913
I'm sure she's shaken
off her tough first day

14:39.947 --> 14:41.915
and turned it around by now.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.650
Speaking of - hey Dash!

14:46.419 --> 14:48.956
Oh, perfect! Hey, can
I borrow Scootaloo?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.357
Me? What for?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.559
Oh, [chuckle] I just
needed some help

14:52.592 --> 14:55.262
and figured the president of
the Rainbow Dash fan club

14:55.295 --> 14:58.065
was the right pony for the job.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.700
I thought the Wonderbolt
Reserves were here to help.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.972
Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing
official Reserves stuff.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.174
But don't worry, with
Scootaloo's help,

15:07.207 --> 15:10.477
everything's gonna be awesome.
Better than awesome.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.380
Does-does that mean practice
went well yesterday?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.381
Gotta go!

15:19.486 --> 15:21.654
What are we doing up here,
Rainbow Dash?

15:21.688 --> 15:23.690
I just need a small
favor from you

15:23.723 --> 15:26.426
that's really gonna make this
show something special.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.462
Now, the Wonderbolts are going
to fly over this ridge

15:29.496 --> 15:31.464
right before the
finale of the show.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.269
I'll fly by last and
when I signal you,

15:36.303 --> 15:38.305
you zip up the ramp
on your scooter

15:38.338 --> 15:40.607
and kick the storm
cloud into my path.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.142
What?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.344
That kick will shoot
off a lightning bolt

15:44.377 --> 15:48.015
right behind me, making
me look totally awesome!

15:48.048 --> 15:50.583
And then I'll do some
incredible Rainbow Dash flying

15:50.617 --> 15:53.253
with it, to create the
coolest, show-stoppingest,

15:53.286 --> 15:57.524
lightning-tastic light show
anypony has ever seen!

15:57.557 --> 16:00.193
Are you sure about this?

16:00.227 --> 16:03.130
[gasps] It's gonna
be so awesome!

16:03.163 --> 16:08.068
And no pony will ever call me
"Rainbow Crash" after this.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.504
Oh, gotta go! Be ready for
me, OK, Scootaloo?

16:11.538 --> 16:15.508
Um, OK?

16:15.542 --> 16:19.412
Mares and gentlecolts, fillies
and foals of all ages,

16:19.446 --> 16:22.082
look to the skies and
prepare to be awestruck

16:22.115 --> 16:26.586
by the incredible flying
prowess of the Wonderbolts!

16:34.494 --> 16:37.330
[cheers]

16:37.364 --> 16:39.732
I hope Spike and Pinkie Pie
are done getting their snacks

16:39.766 --> 16:41.734
or they're going to
miss Rainbow Dash!

16:41.768 --> 16:43.503
Oh don't worry, Fluttershy.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.373
Nothing could keep Pinkie
Pie from missing this.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.508
[chuckle] Except
maybe cotton candy.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.446
C'mon, Pinkie, the
show's starting!

16:53.480 --> 16:57.817
One second! Just a little bit
bigger, please, but hurry!

16:57.850 --> 16:58.751
Bigger!

17:02.455 --> 17:03.623
[gasp]

17:15.468 --> 17:16.269
[cheers]

17:16.303 --> 17:19.572
That was amazing!
She's doing great!

17:19.606 --> 17:21.241
Bigger!

17:21.808 --> 17:22.809
[Spike sighs]

17:39.126 --> 17:40.360
I hope this works!

17:48.401 --> 17:50.503
[cheers]

17:54.341 --> 17:55.642
Ahhhh!

17:57.644 --> 17:58.778
[grunt]

17:58.811 --> 18:00.780
[shouts]

18:00.813 --> 18:02.149
[crowd gasps]

18:03.650 --> 18:05.852
[grunt]

18:05.885 --> 18:07.254
Ahhh!

18:09.356 --> 18:10.757
Whoahh!

18:11.791 --> 18:13.360
[grunt]

18:13.393 --> 18:14.627
[groan]

18:14.661 --> 18:15.862
Ahhhh!

18:15.895 --> 18:17.197
Whoah!

18:21.168 --> 18:21.868
[zap]

18:23.770 --> 18:25.238
Hope I'm not too late!

18:25.272 --> 18:27.240
Pfft! I don't know what
took that pony so long.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.545
Ahhh!

18:32.579 --> 18:33.613
[crash]

18:33.646 --> 18:35.548
[groans]

18:35.582 --> 18:37.617
That was amazing!

18:40.353 --> 18:42.389
Way to go, Rainbow Crash.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.428
[sigh]

18:50.797 --> 18:53.300
You gonna tell us what
just happened, newbie?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.635
[sigh] I am so sorry.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.903
I should hope so.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.771
You changed the routine
without consulting me

18:58.805 --> 19:00.573
and put other
ponies at risk.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.875
I've drummed flyers out
of the Bolts for less.

19:02.909 --> 19:07.514
I know and I'm ready for
whatever punishment you want.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.517
You guys were right to
call me Rainbow Crash.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.452
I've always been
a standout flier,

19:12.485 --> 19:14.787
but since I joined
the Wonderbolts,

19:14.821 --> 19:17.690
I've only stood out
for making mistakes.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.927
[sigh] It's been my
dream my whole life,

19:20.960 --> 19:24.564
but I guess maybe I'm not
Wonderbolt material after all.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.600
Are you serious?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.770
You're the most talented
flier we've ever had.

19:30.803 --> 19:34.574
And you've saved all of
Equestria like, a dozen times!

19:34.607 --> 19:35.575
I-I--

19:35.608 --> 19:37.577
Of course you're supposed
to be a Wonderbolt!

19:37.610 --> 19:39.312
We've been waiting
for a spot to open up

19:39.346 --> 19:40.947
ever since you
joined the Reserves.

19:40.980 --> 19:45.285
But... you guys... all
called me Rainbow Crash.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.854
Yeah, so? My
nickname's Clipper.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.522
You know why they
call me that?

19:49.556 --> 19:52.292
Uh, cause you're as
fast as a ship?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.961
Because I clipped my
wing on a flagpole

19:54.994 --> 19:58.231
as I was landing on
my first day. Huh.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.866
Huh.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.935
Flatfoot. My first day I
misjudged my landing

20:02.969 --> 20:05.638
and came down right on
Spitfire's hoof.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.773
Daisy.

20:06.806 --> 20:07.907
Slowpoke.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.842
Hoof 'n' Mouth.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.312
You don't want to know
what they call me.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.013
[whispers]

20:14.046 --> 20:18.451
[chuckle] Whoa, that is
so much worse than Crash.

20:18.485 --> 20:19.386
Right?

20:19.419 --> 20:22.555
So, does this mean I'm
still on the team?

20:22.589 --> 20:23.790
You think you can be
part of this team

20:23.823 --> 20:25.992
and not constantly
try to showboat?

20:26.025 --> 20:28.661
I promise. I spent my
whole life trying to be

20:28.695 --> 20:30.930
a standout flier, but now
that I'm a Wonderbolt,

20:30.963 --> 20:33.800
it's time to be OK
with fitting in.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.836
Good. Because I really didn't
want to miss the chance

20:36.869 --> 20:39.739
to tease you for years about
this catastrophe!

20:39.772 --> 20:42.375
I mean, that crash was epic!

20:42.409 --> 20:44.744
[everyone agrees]

20:44.777 --> 20:46.579
But you're on
probation for a month!

20:46.613 --> 20:47.880
Got a problem with that?

20:47.914 --> 20:48.915
No, ma'am.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.964
Hey Rainbow Dash, we just
wanted to check on you.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.433
Are you doing OK?

21:06.466 --> 21:08.301
I'm doing great, thanks!

21:08.335 --> 21:09.836
Sure you don't need any help?

21:09.869 --> 21:12.305
Nah. This mess is my
responsibility

21:12.339 --> 21:14.807
and I've gotta clean it up
myself. And after this,

21:14.841 --> 21:16.709
Spitfire's got me cleaning
the Wonderbolts compound

21:16.743 --> 21:18.545
for the next month.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.715
So why are you in
such a good mood?

21:22.749 --> 21:25.585
Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!
