00:10.123 --> 00:13.286
Is there anyone
who doesn't know we're out here?

00:14.393 --> 00:16.190
It's hard for them to understand, sir.

00:16.262 --> 00:18.958
They see American soldiers,
they think the war is over.

00:19.031 --> 00:21.158
<i>(neW Wave of cheering)</i>

00:23.836 --> 00:25.667
All right, all right.

00:32.411 --> 00:37.610
Colonel, may I discuss with you
the role of my men in your mission?

00:38.718 --> 00:42.586
Your men will be
screening our flanks, Captain.

00:44.190 --> 00:49.355
Sir, this is our war, too. We've been
fighting the Japanese for three years.

00:49.428 --> 00:53.728
Captain Pajota, I understand your anger
at what the Japs did to your people today.

00:53.799 --> 00:58.862
If I were you, I'd also want revenge.
But this mission has objectives of its own.

00:58.938 --> 01:03.398
Sir, my men are disciplined fighters. What
happened at Balincarin is not new to them.

01:03.476 --> 01:06.809
Your men will be of great value
on our flanks.

01:06.879 --> 01:09.973
Lieutenant O'Grady,
I'm going to step away.

01:10.049 --> 01:12.540
My compliments to the villagers
for their hospitality.

01:12.618 --> 01:13.915
I'll see to it, sir.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.977
- Captain.
- Colonel.

01:22.762 --> 01:26.323
Want me to take a look
at those feet, Captain?

01:27.900 --> 01:30.232
Yeah.

01:31.003 --> 01:34.996
God only knows
how you walk on these, Bob.

01:36.242 --> 01:40.269
You're lucky the colonel
doesn't know about this.

01:43.216 --> 01:45.776
Doc, can you figure him out?

01:46.986 --> 01:49.318
- Mucci?
- Yeah.

01:49.388 --> 01:52.789
Every time I think I have,
he surprises me.

01:52.858 --> 01:55.190
Not always in a bad way.

01:57.063 --> 01:59.896
He's the reason I joined the Rangers.

01:59.966 --> 02:05.268
There was a time I'd follow him anywhere,
but all we seem to do now is butt heads.

02:07.673 --> 02:11.473
You know, he may not like
you standing up to him...

02:12.478 --> 02:15.675
but I suspect that's why he chose you.

02:15.748 --> 02:20.708
I can't imagine any other reason why he'd
ignore these jungle-rotted dogs of yours.

02:20.786 --> 02:25.189
Besides, think he's out there
feeling on top of the world?

02:33.666 --> 02:37.898
<i>(Ab</i>/<i>e)</i> That's the convoy
Captain Pajota was talking about.

02:43.509 --> 02:47.878
Damn, looks like
they're reinforcing the camp.

02:49.148 --> 02:51.548
Hey, Duke, wake up.

02:53.052 --> 02:55.850
It's your turn
to keep watch on Red.

last night.

09:08.961 --> 09:11.395
Brought in fuel and fresh troops.

09:11.463 --> 09:14.364
Looks like they're up to something.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.234
How many?

09:17.302 --> 09:20.032
Between 150 and 200 of 'em, sir.

09:20.606 --> 09:22.733
Captain?

09:22.808 --> 09:25.971
I was depending on the second platoon
of Fox to hold the Cabu bridge,

09:26.045 --> 09:29.503
but if the Japs have 300 men in the camp,
we'll need everyone on the raid.

09:29.581 --> 09:32.311
Maybe we can
hold the bridge with less men.

09:32.384 --> 09:36.047
Can you make do
with just one squad from Riley's platoon?

09:36.121 --> 09:42.117
I don't think so, sir. Captain Pajota said
the Japs reinforced the bridge last night.

09:43.462 --> 09:47.421
Well, I wish Captain Pajota had shared
this information with me earlier.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.228
Let's take a look.

10:17.262 --> 10:19.423
Get a count.

10:24.303 --> 10:27.329
With respect, sir, what's to count?

10:28.807 --> 10:32.743
Lieutenant Riley's right, sir.
That's a thousand men over there.

10:32.811 --> 10:37.407
Captain, may I show you something?
Here's the bridge.

10:47.192 --> 10:49.126
Colonel.

10:52.531 --> 10:56.558
The others are beginning
to lose faith, aren't they?

10:56.635 --> 11:00.969
- They won't let you down.
- It's not a question of letting <i>me</i> down.

11:01.039 --> 11:04.770
We worked hard to raise a fine unit.
They deserve their shot at glory.

11:06.278 --> 11:11.375
I don't suppose many of us
are in this for the glory, sir.

11:11.450 --> 11:14.419
I'm not talking about publicity, Bob.

11:14.486 --> 11:17.148
It's the glory you carry inside you
the rest of your life

11:17.222 --> 11:21.784
knowing you've done something,
something that made a difference.

11:21.860 --> 11:25.591
The only recognition I want
is from those boys in that camp.

11:25.664 --> 11:26.995
Yes, sir.

11:28.300 --> 11:31.133
Did you come here
to change my mind?

11:31.203 --> 11:33.228
No, sir.

11:33.305 --> 11:38.333
I came to tell you that whatever you decide,
it'll be the right choice.

11:38.410 --> 11:41.811
Some things you gotta take on faith.

11:45.884 --> 11:51.880
Captain Pajota has volunteered to hold
the bridge, if you're willing to hear him out.

11:57.629 --> 12:01.895
Well, you better give me a moment alone
with him so I can eat some humble pie.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.958
Yes, sir.

12:08.907 --> 12:10.374
Captain Pajota?

12:10.442 --> 12:14.674
We wait until they are at this point,
then we blow up the bridge.

12:14.746 --> 12:17.340
We don't have enough explosives
to bring it down.

12:17.416 --> 12:21.045
All we need to do is damage it
enough to stop their vehicles.

12:21.119 --> 12:23.314
We want the soldiers to come.

12:23.388 --> 12:27.552
If I place my men on either side of the road,
we'll trap them in a crossfire.

12:27.626 --> 12:30.720
They'll go around the bridge
and try to outflank you.

12:30.796 --> 12:34.163
The Japanese don't go around,
not when they're fighting Filipinos.

12:34.233 --> 12:38.260
They don't have enough respect
for us as soldiers.

12:51.583 --> 12:54.518
- How are the others?
- Scared.

12:56.255 --> 12:59.713
They're waiting to hear
what you have to say, sir.

13:00.859 --> 13:04.260
I don't know
what to tell them anymore.

13:07.399 --> 13:10.766
I can say something
on your behalf, sir.

13:10.836 --> 13:13.168
Until you feel better.

13:19.077 --> 13:21.978
Are you any good at writing letters?

13:23.081 --> 13:26.175
It depends what kind of letter.

13:27.986 --> 13:30.955
I'm not sure myself.

13:31.023 --> 13:34.686
I already started a dozen times
and tore it up.

13:38.063 --> 13:43.160
There's a... pencil and paper
under my mat.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.873
Who you writing to?

13:56.949 --> 13:59.816
A lady named Margaret.

14:01.219 --> 14:05.019
I'm not sure how well
I know her anymore.

14:05.090 --> 14:08.617
I've been living
in my imagination so long,

14:08.694 --> 14:13.393
I'm afraid I'll write
some crazy love letter...

14:14.866 --> 14:17.266
and embarrass us both.

14:17.336 --> 14:20.328
Red didn't seem to think so.

14:25.444 --> 14:28.140
What'd he tell you?

14:28.213 --> 14:31.341
That she felt the same way you did.

14:32.517 --> 14:37.113
That she'd have left her husband
if you'd wanted her to.

14:38.857 --> 14:44.591
Guess I thought that if I did the right thing,
some good would come of it.

14:45.931 --> 14:48.559
It's funny.

14:48.633 --> 14:51.932
I've spent the last three years

14:52.004 --> 14:55.565
thinking of all the things
I wanna say to her.

14:57.509 --> 15:02.913
Now I don't even know how to begin.

15:04.616 --> 15:07.517
How about, "Dear Margaret"?

15:18.730 --> 15:20.721
<i>(Whimpers)</i>

15:23.435 --> 15:25.733
<i>(door opens)</i>

15:34.980 --> 15:38.848
We found the people
we were looking for.

15:39.851 --> 15:40.840
<i>(Japanese)</i>

15:44.623 --> 15:49.287
- You are free to go.
<i>- (Margaret groans)</i>

16:43.882 --> 16:47.477
<i>(Japanese)</i> Follow her!
She'll lead us to the others.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.040
Shh.

17:15.046 --> 17:18.106
It's all right.
You're safe now.

17:20.986 --> 17:24.046
- They killed Mina.
- I know.

17:26.590 --> 17:28.923
I wasn't always conscious.

17:30.228 --> 17:34.688
- I don't know what I told them.
- You didn't tell them anything.

17:34.766 --> 17:39.169
Mina and her father were arrested
last night on their way to Cabanatuan.

17:39.237 --> 17:41.831
It had nothing to do with you.

17:41.907 --> 17:44.239
She went because of me.

17:45.677 --> 17:49.807
- She knew I wanted to help Daniel.
- She wanted to help him, too.

17:49.881 --> 17:52.543
I should've stopped her.

17:52.784 --> 17:55.947
I should've stopped her.

17:56.021 --> 17:59.320
But all I could think about was him.

18:00.292 --> 18:04.023
Whatever you feel you've done wrong,
you've more than made up for it.

18:04.095 --> 18:07.292
Hundreds of POWs
owe you their lives.

18:07.365 --> 18:10.698
No. I did it for him.

18:10.769 --> 18:14.569
- I stayed for him.
- You'll be with him soon.

18:14.639 --> 18:19.235
I have friends who will hide you
till the Americans come.

18:19.311 --> 18:21.939
But, Margaret, listen to me.

18:22.013 --> 18:27.212
You have to trust in something
stronger than yourself.

18:27.285 --> 18:30.686
Father! Father, the Japanese -
they're here.

18:31.389 --> 18:34.290
Take Margaret.
I'll deal with them.

18:36.761 --> 18:39.696
<i>(Japanese)</i> Arrest anyone you find!
Go around back.

18:47.872 --> 18:49.396
Agh!

18:57.182 --> 19:00.049
OK, run. Run.
Don't look back.

19:02.420 --> 19:05.412
No need to go in the church.
There's no one in there.

19:05.490 --> 19:08.482
- There's no one in the church.
<i>- (ye</i>//<i>s in Japanese)</i>

19:15.367 --> 19:16.857
<i>(shouts in Japanese)</i>

19:23.775 --> 19:29.213
Gents, here it is. At 1700 hours,
our combined forces will leave Platero.

19:29.281 --> 19:31.545
We'll split up here
at the Pampanga River.

19:31.616 --> 19:35.950
Captain Pajota, you'll continue to the Cabu
bridge, where you'll set up a roadblock.

19:36.021 --> 19:39.149
Captain Joson,
do the same on the highway

19:39.224 --> 19:42.057
in case the Japs send reinforcements
from Cabanatuan City.

19:42.127 --> 19:46.086
Your objective is to seal off
the area of operation during the raid.

19:46.164 --> 19:49.998
Any Japanese reinforcements
get through you, they get to us.

19:50.068 --> 19:53.595
We'll need as much darkness as we can
to get the POWs out of the camp,

19:53.672 --> 19:57.768
so we'll have to begin our approach
during daylight and risk detection.

19:57.842 --> 20:02.142
We break the tree line, Lieutenant Riley's
platoon will head to the east of the camp.

20:02.213 --> 20:02.941
Sir.

20:03.014 --> 20:06.541
The rest of us will advance
at a low crawl for the main gate.

20:06.618 --> 20:08.085
How much cover, Captain?

20:08.153 --> 20:10.485
There's cover
up to 200 yards from the camp.

20:10.555 --> 20:15.618
After that, we're totally exposed until we
reach a ditch 30 yards from the front gate.

20:15.694 --> 20:17.855
This is the camp.

20:18.997 --> 20:24.230
This is the main service road,
POW barracks - all enemy occupied.

20:24.302 --> 20:29.205
Suspected tank shed, main gate.
This is the ditch we're trying to reach.

20:29.274 --> 20:31.834
Until we get there
we're completely exposed,

20:31.910 --> 20:35.607
so we may need to create some
diversionary action in this wooded area.

20:35.680 --> 20:40.447
Sir, how about a plane? Could you have
one of your planes fly over the camp?

20:40.518 --> 20:42.713
Not without breaking radio silence.

20:42.787 --> 20:45.688
It's not a bad idea, Bob.
Might be worth the risk.

20:45.757 --> 20:48.851
Good. As we make our approach,

20:48.927 --> 20:52.260
Lieutenant Riley's men
will make their way along this ditch,

20:52.330 --> 20:56.994
leaving men at 20-yard intervals
to engage and reduce the enemy.

20:57.068 --> 21:01.266
Lieutenant Riley, soon as you're
in position here, the southeast corner,

21:01.339 --> 21:05.241
- your first shot will kick off the action.
- Understood.

21:05.310 --> 21:09.076
Good. Meanwhile, the rest of us
will be in position here.

21:09.147 --> 21:12.173
Soon as we get the signal,
Lieutenant Foley's second squad

21:12.250 --> 21:14.844
will take out the guard tower
and sentry shack,

21:14.919 --> 21:18.116
and cover first squad,
who will open the main gate.

21:18.189 --> 21:21.022
Soon as first squad is inside,
they'll flank right,

21:21.092 --> 21:23.822
lay down suppressing fire
on the enemy officer area,

21:23.895 --> 21:26.125
and cover the guys heading
toward the tank shed.

21:26.197 --> 21:29.689
I want Corporal Aldrige
and his loader to run the 200 yards.

21:29.768 --> 21:33.727
I want a backup team in case they don't
make it. Tanks get loose, we're in trouble.

21:33.805 --> 21:37.002
- Yes, sir.
- Extraction's next.

21:37.075 --> 21:41.034
Lieutenant O'Grady, second platoon will
make their way through the main gate

21:41.112 --> 21:43.774
and force entry into the POW area.

21:43.848 --> 21:46.339
First squad will spread
along the south fence

21:46.418 --> 21:49.478
and lay down suppressing fire
to the enemy rear.

21:49.554 --> 21:54.821
Make sure the POW barracks are
protected from enemy fire in all directions.

21:54.893 --> 21:58.021
Once that's achieved,
Lieutenant O'Grady's second squad

21:58.096 --> 22:01.497
will round up the POWs
and lead them to the front gate,

22:01.566 --> 22:04.000
where Dr. Fisher and the medics
will be waiting.

22:04.068 --> 22:06.195
Our aim is to make it
to the Pampanga River,

22:06.271 --> 22:09.240
where carabao carts
will be waiting to escort the prisoners.

22:09.307 --> 22:11.798
As soon as I'm satisfied
we've left no one behind,

22:11.876 --> 22:15.972
I'll fire a red star cluster
to signal the raid's over.

22:16.047 --> 22:18.345
Any questions?

22:18.416 --> 22:21.214
Yes, sir.
Who's the last man out?

22:21.286 --> 22:24.153
That'll be me.
You'll cover me at the front gate.

22:24.222 --> 22:27.020
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

22:28.026 --> 22:30.221
Brief your people,
get 'em ready to go.

22:30.295 --> 22:32.627
We leave in two hours.

22:58.690 --> 23:00.681
You OK, Top?

23:01.359 --> 23:03.486
Yeah, I'm all right.

23:06.998 --> 23:09.694
I want a word about Lieutenant Riley.

23:14.138 --> 23:16.129
He's got a tough assignment.

What's that?

Why?

23:25.116 --> 23:27.448
Nothing. Just curious.

23:31.523 --> 23:33.514
250 Japs at that camp.

23:33.591 --> 23:36.617
Another thousand at the river.

a little miracle.
