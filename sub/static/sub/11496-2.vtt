I do.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.213
Hey, do you think I'd look
good in a jumpsuit?

18:02.215 --> 18:04.348
You'd look good in anything.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.483
That's 'cause I'm good-looking.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.018
I pretend like I don't know.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.419
Shh.

18:08.421 --> 18:13.024
Seriously, if you want privacy,
then why do you have a roommate?

18:13.026 --> 18:15.493
Oh, you know, alan's
way more than a roommate.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.929
He's my best friend.

18:17.931 --> 18:22.467
He was there for me
when I was all alone.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.837
He even took me
into my own house.

18:25.839 --> 18:29.574
You know, him and-and
his stoner son

18:29.576 --> 18:33.544
And his horny mom
and your dead dad.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.513
I mean, they've really
become my family.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.682
Mine, too.

18:37.684 --> 18:42.019
I guess that means you're
becoming part of my family.

18:42.021 --> 18:45.456
Aw...!

18:45.458 --> 18:49.060
I'm the most masculine
person in this house.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.028
(both laughing)

18:51.030 --> 18:52.363
I like you, jenny.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.866
I like you, walden.

18:54.868 --> 18:58.336
If you were a chick,
I would totally do you.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.305
Aw! You, too!

19:02.541 --> 19:06.077
Hey, you're welcome
to crash here any time

19:06.079 --> 19:09.547
You need a break
from evelyn and...

19:09.549 --> 19:12.817
91-and-a-half shades of gray.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.318
Seriously?

19:14.320 --> 19:15.653
Yeah.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.289
You know, I was thinking about
putting in a home gym,

19:18.291 --> 19:20.258
But big deal.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.393
I'd rather have
a jenny than a gym.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.795
You and me both.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.330
(both laugh)

19:26.332 --> 19:27.632
I get it.

19:27.634 --> 19:31.102
'cause jim and gym
are homonyms

19:31.104 --> 19:33.271
And you're a "hamma-sexual."

19:36.742 --> 19:39.310
It's awfully quiet in there.
Did they leave?

19:39.312 --> 19:41.846
I don't know.
Let me go look.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.451
I shouldn't have looked.

Alan, what are you doing here?

You're supposed

20:01.067 --> 20:02.200
To be at my house

20:02.202 --> 20:03.534
I said I would try.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.303
And I said I wouldn't cry.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.838
And I guess
we're both liars now.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.541
Would you keep it down?
Larry's here.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.977
What? You don't want him
