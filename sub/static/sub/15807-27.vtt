    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.873 --> 00:07.705
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.774 --> 00:10.476
¶ That started from
      this tropic port ¶

00:10.544 --> 00:12.644
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.713 --> 00:15.580

00:17.618 --> 00:19.451

00:29.396 --> 00:31.630
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

01:17.110 --> 01:19.878
When I was a kid, we went
       to the beach on Saturday.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.447
Friday, we were bored 'cause on
Saturday we'd go to the beach.

01:22.515 --> 01:25.550
- You know what I mean?
    - Yes, I know.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.987
We worried if bus was late,
  we wouldn't get to the beach

01:29.055 --> 01:31.022
until it was late,
            if we reached late--

01:31.091 --> 01:33.125
Here, that ought
to keep quiet for a while.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.227
Stay right here while I go
gather some more wood.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.696
[mumbling]

01:39.533 --> 01:41.099
(male #1)
     'Now listen, you guys,
     and listen good.'

01:41.168 --> 01:42.567
'You and Louis case the island'

01:42.636 --> 01:44.469
'for a place to sleep tonight'

01:44.538 --> 01:49.274
'and don't forget, if you
  see anybody, shoot to kill.'

01:49.343 --> 01:50.809
[wood clattering]

01:54.548 --> 01:56.081
Gilligan?
           Gilligan?

01:56.149 --> 01:57.115
[mumbling]

01:57.184 --> 01:58.583
That's a good boy.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.986
- You can let go of that--
   - Get down, get down.

02:01.055 --> 02:03.388
- "Shoot to kill."
 - What are you talking about?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.456
Follow me, follow me, follow me.

02:05.525 --> 02:06.792
Gee.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.599
- They're right behind the hill.
- Who is right behind the hill?

02:14.668 --> 02:17.836
(male #1)
    'Arty, you and Sid know
    what to do. Get going.'

02:17.905 --> 02:20.038
(male #2)
  'You mean what
  you said to Gus and Louis?'

02:20.107 --> 02:23.474
(male #1)
    'I did, if you see
    anybody, shoot to kill'

02:23.543 --> 02:25.243
'and ask questions later.'

02:25.312 --> 02:26.878
(male #2)
         'Good enough
         for me, boss.'

02:26.947 --> 02:29.281
That's good enough for me too.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.621
So that's how we made
     our getaway.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.390
- Isn't it, Gilligan?
      - Yeah.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.359
Gilligan has a vivid imagination
but since you both heard them.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.762
- Tell 'em what the boss said.
- I will, he said--

02:43.831 --> 02:45.397
He said, "If you see anybody,
shoot to kill

02:45.465 --> 02:46.865
and ask questions later."

02:46.934 --> 02:50.468
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't worry. I'll protect you.

02:50.537 --> 02:53.539
- I'll be murdered in my bed.
 - Over my dead body.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.206
- Oh-h-h.
 - Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, Lovey.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.309
All women are so delicate.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.245
Well, what do you
               think, Professor?

03:00.314 --> 03:02.114
You saw how many
     gangsters were there?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.282
There was Louis and Arty
and Sid and..

03:04.351 --> 03:05.850
Sounds like
        a teenage singing group.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.853
- Is that all, just four?
  - No, there are plenty more.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.589
- How many? Take a guess?
   - Thirty seven.

03:10.657 --> 03:14.392
- You counted 37 gangsters?
- No, that's my guess. Do I win?

03:14.461 --> 03:16.094
Cut that out.
We're not playing a game.

03:16.163 --> 03:19.698
Now, Professor, I figured
there was maybe eight or nine?

03:19.766 --> 03:22.534
- You know something, Skipper?
 - Got an idea brewing?

03:22.602 --> 03:24.202
Well, obviously they got
        to this island by boat.

03:24.271 --> 03:28.373
We could sneak on board, borrow
their boat, take off for Hawaii?

03:28.442 --> 03:30.809
- That'd be stealing.
   - These men are gangsters.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.710
If they find us,
   they'll kill us, you said so.

03:32.779 --> 03:36.013
- You still think it's stealing?
- Let's borrow their boat.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.549
We oughta figure out

03:37.617 --> 03:40.318
where they've set up camp
   and stay outta their way.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.187
I'll get Mr. Howell,
         and we'll reckon later.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.389
We'll get Mr. Howell
      and reckon later.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.057
I think we gotta scatter out
a bit first.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.793
Come on, Gilligan.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.830
[instrumental music]

03:58.872 --> 04:01.306
[whistling]

04:04.978 --> 04:06.878
[whistling continues]

04:14.354 --> 04:16.321
[whistling continues]

04:21.060 --> 04:23.261
Gilligan, can't you breathe
without whistling?

04:23.330 --> 04:25.096
I'm sorry
            but I can't help it.

04:25.164 --> 04:29.167
When I'm nervous, my breath
     comes in short whistles.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.703
Well, stop breathing
or go back to camp.

04:31.771 --> 04:32.737
[gasping]

04:32.806 --> 04:34.205
Get down.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.409
[whistling]

04:45.486 --> 04:47.452
Oh, oh, oh.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.557
Would you ladies
          mind giving me a hand?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.126
- Sure.
           - Thanks.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.061
Here we go.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.696
To the right, Gilligan.

04:58.765 --> 05:02.367
Move a bit more to the right.
Wait, what's that noise I hear?

05:02.436 --> 05:05.903
That's why I was sent to guard
 y'all. Let's not talk of it.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.974
- Let go, I've got it tied off.
- Yeah, oh, alright.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.511
Now if you ladies
    will step aside, please.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.412
Not you Mary Ann,
  you're guarding the trigger.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.448
- I'll show how catapult works.
- Oh, if it works.

05:16.516 --> 05:17.648
[giggles]

05:17.717 --> 05:19.184
Say a gangster is at the door.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.519
[screams]

05:20.587 --> 05:23.021
- The gangsters are at the door.
- Where? where?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.488
Isn't that what
      you told me to say?

05:24.557 --> 05:26.357
Huh? Oh, yeah, well.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.859
[knock]

05:29.362 --> 05:32.063
The gangsters are at the door.
 I'll begin the countdown.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.867
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six

05:35.936 --> 05:37.102
'five, four'

05:37.170 --> 05:40.504
three, two, one, pull.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.373
- Look out for the chair.
   - What?

05:42.442 --> 05:43.675
[screaming]

05:47.714 --> 05:50.649
- Thanks a lot, Gilligan.
   - But it worked.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.219
Let's get going.

05:54.288 --> 05:56.421
I wanna find the Professor and
 Mr. Howell before it's dark.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.224
- Did you see any gangsters?
  - Not so far.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.761
Oh, Skipper, I hope they
  haven't captured Mr. Howell.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.796
He'll lead the whole gang
   right back here.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.632
Don't worry. Even if they do
capture, he won't say anything.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.368
- Even if they torture him.
  - You don't know my husband.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.403
He has a very low
       threshold of pain.

06:12.472 --> 06:13.705
He'll answer
     any questions they ask

06:13.774 --> 06:15.573
if they so much
      as pluck an eyebrow.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.375
I wouldn't worry
              about his eyebrow.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.976
If those gangsters
              see Mr. Howell

06:19.045 --> 06:21.846
they have definite orders,
      "shoot to kill.."

06:21.915 --> 06:24.883
Come on, Gilligan, we better
go find them right away.

06:24.951 --> 06:25.750
[screams]

06:25.819 --> 06:28.019
"...and ask question later."

06:30.490 --> 06:32.457
[dramatic music]

06:38.898 --> 06:40.699
[rustling]

06:44.972 --> 06:45.903
What's that?

06:45.972 --> 06:48.440
Maybe it was Sid or Arty
        or Louis or Gus.

06:48.508 --> 06:49.841
Get down.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.987
[rustling]

07:11.464 --> 07:12.731
Ah!

07:23.577 --> 07:25.743
I'm-I'm Thurston Howell III,
I'm filthy rich.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.478
I'll take you
to my wife's jewels.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.780
Mr. Howell?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.248
I'll give you
         a thousand blank checks

07:30.317 --> 07:33.585
I'll teach you to sign
       my name I'll give you a..

07:34.587 --> 07:38.023
Oh, sorry about your leg.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.228
(male #3)
    'Just as soon as
    Arty and Louis get back'

07:44.297 --> 07:46.832
'we're gonna plan the attack.'

07:48.234 --> 07:51.002
(male #1)
       'He's guarding
       the boat, stupid.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.437
Gus has a gun.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.506
Louis is guarding the boat,
stupid...Skipper.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.209
(male #3)
        'Thanks, boss.'

07:57.277 --> 07:59.243
(male #1)
     'We'll let 'em have it
     at the crack of dawn.'

07:59.312 --> 08:03.447
- I think I'm gonna faint.
   - Not now, Mr. Howell.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.917
Later. I'll faint later.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.353
Come on, we better
       get back to camp.

08:08.422 --> 08:11.489
Wait, does Louis have the gun?
 Or is he guarding the boat?

08:11.558 --> 08:13.859
- Was that Sid or Gus--
    - Shut up and come on.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.798
- Watch out, Mary Ann.
     - I will, Mr. Howell.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.267
- Ah, brave, ah.
        - Yes, darling.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.936
- Stout girl, Ginger.
     - Yes, Mr. Howell.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.706
I still say we gotta take their
boat and get off this island.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.675
Suppose we find their boat
   and overpower their guard

08:30.744 --> 08:32.677
there's the possibility
       that the others will find

08:32.746 --> 08:35.313
our camp deserted and capture us
before we can leave.

08:35.381 --> 08:39.150
It will be dawn in another hour.
They're practically on us now.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.784
We haven't got a chance.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.520
It'll take a small army with
guns to keep the gangsters away.

08:43.590 --> 08:47.125
A small army.
         A small army with guns.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.127
What are you talking about?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.763
W-w-well, it's an old movie,
Beau Geste, don't you remember?

08:51.832 --> 08:53.431
I remember Beau Geste,
     what about it?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.667
We'll do the same thing Beau did

08:55.735 --> 08:57.969
when the Arabs were
   about to attack the fort.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.437
I get it. Beau Geste, yeah.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.239
- Tell 'em about it.
      - Well--

09:01.308 --> 09:04.342
Gary Cooper was in his fort,
 about to be attacked, alone--

09:04.411 --> 09:06.844
Gary Cooper put dead soldiers
 all over the place

09:06.913 --> 09:10.215
and he put guns in their hand,
to look like they had more men.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.450
- Wha-what happened? Go on.
  - Digby got shot.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.452
Digby was Beau's
        younger brother.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.553
Got shot like this.

09:15.622 --> 09:16.588
[imitating gunshot]

09:16.657 --> 09:18.956
Oh, Digby.
           Oh, Digby.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.826
Oh, Digby.
    Oh, Digby, speak to me.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.261
Nurse Drusilla.
        They got me.

09:23.329 --> 09:27.098
Don't leave me, Digby.
You're the one I love, not Beau.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.699
You've got to live.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.735
You've got to live.
      You've got to.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.236
[whistling]

09:32.305 --> 09:34.839
You've got to stop whistling
  or get another nurse.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.974
You know, it's
    a very interesting idea.

09:37.043 --> 09:40.778
There's only one problem. The
 dead soldiers here will be us.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.214
No, we'll take your clothes,
dress 'em like dead soldiers

09:43.283 --> 09:44.248
and I'll get 'em.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.885
Wait a minute,
      you come back here.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.886
My clothes? Soldiers?

09:48.955 --> 09:50.855
Well, they are obviously not GI.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.558
Mr. Howell, what we're
     gonna do is stuff them

09:53.627 --> 09:54.926
so they look like soldiers.

09:54.994 --> 09:58.330
What a wonderful invention,
  instant men.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.839
'Here come the soldiers.
    Here come the army.'

10:07.907 --> 10:10.809
Oh, I'm proud of you, Digby,
  you too nurse Drusilla.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.244
Oh, my beautiful
Hampstead suits.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.079
I won't permit it.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.783
In that case, pick up the suit
 you wanna be buried in.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.785
I'll permit it.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.877
Ginger, now be sure
 and keep those big eyes open.

10:46.946 --> 10:50.515
Professor, thanks.
    Mary Ann, watch, watch.

10:50.583 --> 10:54.252
Mr. and Mrs. Howell, this is
the zero hour, keep a good look.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.187
[whistling]

10:59.392 --> 11:01.226
Get out there on the wall.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.995
[sigh]

11:04.063 --> 11:06.430
(male #1)
    'Okay, Louis. Okay, Sid.
    Keep down, Gus.'

11:06.499 --> 11:10.467
'And remember, all you guys,
  shoot to kill.'

11:10.536 --> 11:12.770
- Oh.
          - Oh, Lovey.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.806
Now, listen,
      don't any panic body

11:15.875 --> 11:18.743
just because
   the comesters are ganging.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.478
Skipper's right.
  If we panic, we're through.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.279
Thurston, what are we gonna do?

11:22.348 --> 11:25.183
Well, I don't know about you
    but I'm gonna surrender.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.485
- Howell?
   - I think they're coming.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.455
Yeah, I think I see 'em.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.426
[rustling]

11:38.131 --> 11:40.131
(male #1)
'Alright, you guys, follow me.'

11:40.200 --> 11:43.468
Shoot first. Shoot first.
  We're wanted, dead or alive.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.270
- Dead or alive.
        - A parrot?

11:47.006 --> 11:48.472
You mean he's Louis?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.174
- And Arty?
          - And Sid?

11:50.243 --> 11:53.277
- And Gus?
  - Watch out, Gus has a gun.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.147
- Gilligan, it's a parrot.
 - Yes, unless this is a trick.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.114
Come on, men.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.984
- Oh, thank you.
        - Get out.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.353
Shoot to kill
    and ask questions later.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.292
Here, little parrot.
      Here, huh.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.895
Sam's a pretty a parrot.
   Isn't Sam a pretty parrot?

12:10.964 --> 12:14.999
- His name must be Sam.
   - Good thinking, Gilligan.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.436
Then all that talk about
a gangster's boat was just talk.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.737
[squawking]

12:19.806 --> 12:21.539
He's trying to tell
      us something.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.140
Right, and unless
I miss my guess

12:23.209 --> 12:25.710
that bird is a gold mine
of information.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.112
He may be our salvation.
Our means of escape.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.981
- Our means of escape?
     - Certainly.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.717
Parrots don't make things up,
they repeat what they've heard.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.719
So there must be gangsters
and a boat.

12:34.788 --> 12:35.753
[squawking]

12:35.822 --> 12:37.755
He knows something.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.323
It's up to us to get
      that information.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.592
I hope this parrot
              is a stool pigeon.

12:41.661 --> 12:42.793
[squawking]

12:42.862 --> 12:44.462
Hi, Sam.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.364
[squawking]

12:55.007 --> 12:57.641
- Sam, you've gotta help us.
  - Who's your boss?

12:57.710 --> 12:58.810
Where is that camp?

12:58.878 --> 13:00.144
He's entitled at least
one phone call.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.914
- Quiet.
   - Now, where is the loot?

13:02.983 --> 13:05.183
Come on, Sam.
     Don't you wanna talk?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.718
Of course, he wants to talk.
Don't you, Sam?

13:07.787 --> 13:10.054
Why doesn't
that silly bird talk?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.790
- Maybe he's taken the fifth.
 - Quiet, Gilligan.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.792
He's at least entitled
     to a mouthpiece.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.262
- Quiet.
    - And a public defender.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.196
Perhaps, there is no point
   in asking questions.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.265
Parrots don't think in terms
  of conversation.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.400
They're like tape recorders,
they only repeat what they hear.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.537
How do you like that,
     just like wives.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.139
What have we got so far?

13:28.207 --> 13:31.208
I think we can reasonably deduce
from his continuous mention

13:31.277 --> 13:34.812
of the names Arty,
      Louis, Gus and, uh..

13:34.880 --> 13:37.815
- Sid.
       - Sid, thank you.

13:37.884 --> 13:42.086
Sid, that those are the names of
the men he was associated with.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.555
And they brought stolen goods
 and provisions

13:44.624 --> 13:45.723
to the island in a boat.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.558
[squawking]

13:47.627 --> 13:49.093
He got a spuck, out of nut time.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.196
Yes, he certainly reacted.
   What did you say?

13:51.264 --> 13:56.567
What did I say?
Well, stolen goods, provisions.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.836
- What else did I say?
   - Nothing except for boat.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.037
[squawking]

14:00.106 --> 14:02.807
That's it, boat.
    Sam, where is the boat?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.041
[squawking]

14:04.110 --> 14:06.110
You're on such
      good terms with him.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.179
Why don't you ask him
     where's the loot?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.581
- Loot?
  - Never mind. I'll ask him.

14:10.650 --> 14:16.086
Ah, Sam, what did they steal?
 Gold? Silver? Money?

14:16.155 --> 14:19.190
- Ah, it's really a stupid bird.
- He is not stupid.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.392
I better look at my notes,
     perhaps I missed something.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.526
You missed the boat.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.095
[squawking]

14:25.932 --> 14:30.869
Let's see, I tried
      gold, silver, money.

14:31.871 --> 14:36.474
I tried stocks,
        bonds...jewelry.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.009
[squawking]

14:39.378 --> 14:43.414
Didn't I say that before?
   Didn't I say...jewelry?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.750
[squawking]

14:45.819 --> 14:47.151
Something wrong, Mr. Howell?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.988
No, the bird's simply exhausted.
He seems very tired.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.323
I'll take him to our hut
and have him lie down--

14:52.392 --> 14:54.225
No need to disturb, Mrs. Howell.

14:54.294 --> 14:57.027
We'll take him to our hut.
  Gilligan can sleep with him.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.763
Wait. Is that a boy parrot
      or a girl parrot?

14:59.832 --> 15:01.332
His name is Sam, isn't it?

15:01.401 --> 15:04.402
Oh, yeah, I was afraid
          he might lay an egg.

15:09.609 --> 15:13.111
¶ Rock-a-by birdie
              in the tree top ¶

15:13.179 --> 15:16.280
¶ Your mom was a parrot
         so was your pop ¶

15:16.349 --> 15:19.884
¶ Why won't you tell us
what we want to know ¶

15:19.953 --> 15:25.556
¶ The minute you do, Sam,
       we'll let you go ¶¶

15:25.625 --> 15:27.458
[squawking]

15:27.527 --> 15:30.260
Come on, tell us
       where the provisions are.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.563
Will you forget the provisions,
we don't need food.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.597
We need a boat.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.133
[squawking]

15:35.201 --> 15:37.735
See the way he jumps when
   you mention the word boat.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.303
[squawking]

15:39.371 --> 15:42.273
Will you stop mentioning that
word? You gonna wear him out.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.341
Okay. I thought if
             I mention the stuff

15:44.410 --> 15:47.678
that was on the B-O-T-E
he might lead us to the B-O-T-E.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.847
Gilligan, it's B-O-A-T.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.316
[squawking]

15:52.384 --> 15:54.218
You know, Lovey, it's amazing
 that bird's reaction.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.021
When I say the word jewelry,
  he jumps up and down

15:57.090 --> 15:59.022
and chatters a mile a minute.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.525
Darling, that's just
            the way I react.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.861
He knows something about
the gangsters' loot.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.729
Let's try to find out
           what it is.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.298
I'm gonna take that bird away
   from Gilligan and Skipper

16:08.367 --> 16:10.534
and give him a whiff
            of your jewelry.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.935
What good will that do?

16:12.004 --> 16:14.672
After he gets the right scent,
  I'm gonna take him outside

16:14.741 --> 16:16.541
and we'll follow
           after that bloodhound

16:16.609 --> 16:18.910
whose gonna lead us right to
the gangsters' buried treasure.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.545
Oh, darling,
how clever you are.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.081
Our stay on this island may
prove profitable after all.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.184
You're so right, Lovey.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.819
You know something, my dear,
  once again I have proven

16:28.888 --> 16:32.256
that my brilliance
 is only exceeded by my greed.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.529
Well, well, how's our little
    friend? Is he rested?

16:38.598 --> 16:41.098
Yeah, but we are worn out
       from asking questions.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.167
He won't tell us
where the B-O-T-E is.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.469
Oh, for shame, Skipper,
    that's B-O-A-T.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.904
[squawking]

16:46.973 --> 16:50.241
No, no, you gotta spell it
 B-O-T-E or it drives him crazy.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.111
Yes, well, perhaps
     he doesn't feel well.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.045
Jewelry.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.548
[squawking]

16:57.617 --> 17:00.851
No wonder he doesn't talk.
There's a splinter in his foot.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.888
- That could be very painful.
 - Gee, that's too bad.

17:03.956 --> 17:07.458
I'll take him to Mrs. Howell,
she used to be a nurse's aide.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.863
Come on, Sam. Uncle Thurston
 will fix you. He's smart too.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.097
Bye, Sam.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.566
- They didn't steal pearls.
   - Are you sure?

17:16.635 --> 17:18.536
Well, it's process
              of elimination.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.305
Come up with something that
   bird likes and see him react.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.207
Try it with the rest
            of your jewels.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.375
[squawking]

17:24.443 --> 17:26.544
Now do you know
                 why I'm sure?

17:26.612 --> 17:27.845
[rumbling]

17:27.914 --> 17:29.480
[squawking]

17:31.117 --> 17:33.651
He walked around
                the emerald.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.553
Turned up his nose
              at the ruby.

17:36.622 --> 17:40.758
Didn't like the sapphire-- Oops,
oh, he likes that big diamond.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.893
'He loves that big diamond.'

17:42.962 --> 17:45.362
He ate that big diamond.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.231
Ah, come back here.

17:52.271 --> 17:55.206
Lovey? Did you see-- I--

17:57.310 --> 17:59.243
[squawking]

18:11.658 --> 18:13.224
[squawking]

18:15.628 --> 18:19.029
Don't say anything, Lovey.
Don't say anything that's all.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.099
- But--
   - Don't say anything. Shh.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.480
- Lovey, where did he go?
   - He flew under the bed.

18:36.548 --> 18:39.317
- Why didn't you say something?
- You told me not to.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.053
crunch

18:43.122 --> 18:44.655
- Ouch.
        - Oh, Thurston.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.327
[squawking]

18:57.137 --> 18:59.036
He wanted to get
             in his little cage?

18:59.105 --> 19:00.537
Now give me that diamond back.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.474
Thurston, Ginger and Gilligan
 are headed this way.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.676
Nobody's getting this bird
  until I get back my diamond.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.579
Lovey, Lovey,
     here, give me a hand.

19:08.648 --> 19:12.216
- Here, cover it up.
- Oh, that'll put him to sleep.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.585
[gasps]

19:14.654 --> 19:16.754
I heard about poor
              little Sam's foot.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.557
She took a course in first aid.
She wants to help.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.359
The thing that happened
         was most distressing.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.594
You see, Mrs. Howell
       was removing the splinter

19:23.663 --> 19:27.131
and the patient got off the
   operating table and ran away.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.333
- He ran away with a sore foot?
- Oh.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.702
Yes, it was pathetic seeing
the poor little thing

19:31.771 --> 19:33.604
limping around.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.239
We'll organize
a search party.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.041
Without Sam, we'll never find
the boat.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.775
[squawking]

19:38.844 --> 19:41.244
[Thurston coughing]

19:41.313 --> 19:42.780
Oh, these huts
                  are so drafty.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.682
Mr. Howell, you better
          watch that cough.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.485
- It sure sounded strange.
 - Oh, no, no, no, I'm alright.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.855
Why don't you and Gilligan
      go look for the bird.

19:50.923 --> 19:54.291
We better find something to
carry him in with his bad foot.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.592
That's a good idea, Gilligan.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.761
Mr. Howell, can we
borrow your bird cage, huh?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.831
- That's a wonderful idea--
  - Lovey, Lovey.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.900
I've never heard
  of such a ridiculous thing.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.402
What's ridiculous in borrowing
  a cage for a bird?

20:05.471 --> 20:07.771
Last time the bird got
   the splinter in the paw--

20:07.840 --> 20:09.339
- 'Oh.'
 - 'Well, what should we use?'

20:09.408 --> 20:11.542
What should you use?
      Oh, yes, yes.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.944
Here, use this, Gilligan.
   Use that.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.146
- Picnic basket--
  - It's not a picnic basket.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.815
It's-it's-it's
        a parrot basket.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.850
I've never heard
   of a parrot basket before.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.919
- 'I'll never be without one.'
 - They're really marvelous.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.356
You go get the Skipper and
  I'm gonna make some hot water.

20:26.425 --> 20:28.692
- What for?
     - Well, I don't know.

20:28.761 --> 20:32.797
Every movie I was in, I made hot
water before I did an operation.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.935
Oh, that was a close one.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.603
- Too close for comfort.
    - Hmm.

20:39.672 --> 20:44.642
Well, Sam, my boy.
Now you come out or am I gonna..

20:44.711 --> 20:47.478
Sam, pretty Sam.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.916
Sam, pretty Sam.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.719
[squawking]

20:57.323 --> 21:00.224
Sam, pretty Sam.

21:00.292 --> 21:01.959
(Sam)
       'Sam, pretty Sam.'

21:02.028 --> 21:04.328
'Sam, pretty Sam.'

21:05.664 --> 21:07.698
He's right here
in the basket.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.201
Uh, Mr. Howell is right,
        it is a parrot basket.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.371
And look what else
is in the basket.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.007
That's Mrs. Howell's
            big diamond.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.408
In a parrot box?

21:18.477 --> 21:20.811
It's a combination
       parrot box and jewel box.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.612
[squawking]

21:22.681 --> 21:25.416
Heard that? He squawks when
  you say boat and say jewels.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.817
[squawking]

21:26.886 --> 21:28.485
Egad, my secret is out.

21:28.554 --> 21:33.457
(both)
        Jewels, jewels,
        jewels, jewels..

21:33.525 --> 21:35.492
- Hey, see, Skipper.
      - Jewels.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.795
- Jewels.
    - Yeah, oh, look, look.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.797
[squawking]

21:39.866 --> 21:43.033
He's trying to tell us
something. Let's follow him.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.303
[squawking]

21:47.172 --> 21:48.539
[squawking continues]

22:01.653 --> 22:03.888
[squawking continues]

22:18.071 --> 22:19.469
Never seen this cave before.

22:19.538 --> 22:20.603
Maybe this is where
      the gangsters

22:20.672 --> 22:22.172
hid their boat and jewels.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.540
[squawking]

22:23.609 --> 22:26.877
Look at this.
  Look at this old newspaper.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.446
"Bandits rob
   San Francisco Art Museum."

22:29.515 --> 22:31.515
You see, Sam was right
about the gangsters.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.051
Yeah, but look at the date,
  April 10, 1906.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.453
Oh, no, this whole thing
    is ancient history.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.288
The boat, the bandits,
    the jewelry, everything.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.824
[squawking]

22:40.892 --> 22:44.127
If they robbed a museum, perhaps
the treasure is buried here

22:44.196 --> 22:47.064
and that's why the bird gets
    upset when he hears jewels.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.366
Oh, look, look, he's digging
  up something, look.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.901
(Mr. Howell)
   'Come on, let's help him.'

22:50.970 --> 22:53.070
[squawking]

23:01.180 --> 23:04.081
The-the jewels
must be in there.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.185
It's a jewel box alright.

23:08.254 --> 23:09.620
[squawking]

23:14.393 --> 23:18.629
- Jewel crackers.
      - Crackers, ah.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.534
I refuse to believe it.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.106
Sam wants a cracker,
      Sam wants a cracker.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.582
(Sam)
     'Sam wants a cracker,
     Sam wants a cracker.'

23:39.651 --> 23:42.219
Sam wants a cracker.

23:42.288 --> 23:45.722
Gilligan, your parrot
     wants another cracker.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.658
Skipper, I already
gave him 15 crackers.

23:48.727 --> 23:50.961
(Sam)
     'Sam wants a cracker.'

23:51.029 --> 23:53.564
You better make it 16
 or we'll never get any sleep.

23:53.632 --> 23:56.099
Okay, Skipper.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.335
[grunts]

23:58.404 --> 24:00.504
- Sorry, Skipper.
       - Yes, Gilligan.

24:06.378 --> 24:07.678
- Gilligan.
          - Hm?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.914
As soon as you get back
    in your hammock

24:09.982 --> 24:11.815
that bird's gonna
     want another cracker.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.517
Why don't you give him
     the whole box

24:13.586 --> 24:16.353
so we can both get some sleep.

24:16.422 --> 24:20.191
- You're a real smart man.
  - Of course, I am, Gilligan.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.060
[clattering]

24:25.364 --> 24:26.931
[grunts]

24:28.901 --> 24:31.768
Well, that was a great idea.
That'll keep him quiet.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.670
Of course,
              it will, Gilligan.

24:33.739 --> 24:36.440
Just takes a little
         common sense and logic.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.408
I never would have
thought of it.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.943
Gilligan, that's why
            I'm the Skipper.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.579
So I can solve the problem
      as they come up.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.081
You sure solved that one.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.117
Sam's got all the crackers.
What else could he want now?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.387
Sam wants a drink of water.

24:50.456 --> 24:52.223
'Sam wants a drink of water.'

25:03.402 --> 25:04.802
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:04.871 --> 25:06.302
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

25:06.371 --> 25:08.905
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:08.974 --> 25:10.840
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:10.909 --> 25:12.976
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

25:13.045 --> 25:14.945
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:15.014 --> 25:17.414
¶ To make
    the others comfortable ¶

25:17.483 --> 25:19.583
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:19.652 --> 25:21.684
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcars ¶

25:21.753 --> 25:23.853
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:23.922 --> 25:25.990
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:26.058 --> 25:27.992
¶ As primitive as can be ¶

25:28.060 --> 25:30.560
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:30.629 --> 25:32.629
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:32.698 --> 25:34.998
¶ From seven stranded
     castaways ¶

25:35.066 --> 25:37.067
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶¶
