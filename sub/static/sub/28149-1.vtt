Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:16.985 --> 02:17.919
Oh, shit!

02:20.188 --> 02:21.056
Shit.

02:43.078 --> 02:43.945
Max?

02:48.050 --> 02:49.482
Norma?

03:11.772 --> 03:13.207
This girl is how old?

03:13.209 --> 03:14.407
23.

03:14.409 --> 03:17.244
Ah wow, that is...
even for Jack.

03:17.246 --> 03:18.477
Yeah well, he's in LA.

03:18.479 --> 03:20.846
23 is like, you
know, fossilized.

03:20.848 --> 03:22.850
He's become
that guy, you know,

03:22.852 --> 03:24.651
the one you see with
some teenage girl,

03:24.653 --> 03:26.786
think he's a father
with his daughter

03:26.788 --> 03:28.488
until he like, kisses
her on the mouth

03:28.490 --> 03:30.023
or smacks her ass.

03:30.025 --> 03:31.291
Then you don't know whether
to call Family Services

03:31.293 --> 03:32.826
or just call him an asshole.

03:32.828 --> 03:34.928
Yeah, an asshole who's
getting 23-year-old pussy.

03:34.930 --> 03:36.363
Is it that much better?

03:36.365 --> 03:38.231
Yeah it's something
that every man covets.

03:38.233 --> 03:41.300
Why, because it makes your
dick feel less geriatric?

03:41.302 --> 03:42.703
That's right.

03:42.705 --> 03:45.371
Um, excuse me, what kind
of tequila do you have?

03:45.373 --> 03:46.741
The one with the worm.

03:47.475 --> 03:48.841
Jesus.

03:48.843 --> 03:50.543
It is a college bar,
what do you want?

03:50.545 --> 03:52.478
Fine, I'll take
that on the rocks.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.382
No worm.

03:53.748 --> 03:55.881
Hi, yes, sorry.

03:55.883 --> 03:58.518
What cabernets do you have?

03:58.520 --> 03:59.755
The red one.

04:01.490 --> 04:03.125
I will take it.

04:03.626 --> 04:04.691
Embarrassing.

04:04.693 --> 04:06.393
I cannot believe we drank here.

04:06.395 --> 04:07.427
You practically slept here.

04:07.429 --> 04:08.961
That I did.

04:08.963 --> 04:11.165
Remember Funny Hat Fridays?

04:11.432 --> 04:13.366
Ah, I was always the pirate.

04:13.368 --> 04:14.669
Oh, you were.

04:19.608 --> 04:21.274
So what do you
think the note said?

04:21.276 --> 04:23.676
Probably "Sorry I bailed,
sorry I made you fly

04:23.678 --> 04:25.779
"800 miles to my funeral
in the middle of Larry's

04:25.781 --> 04:26.846
"fucking busy season."

04:26.848 --> 04:28.214
No, I mean about his wife.

04:28.216 --> 04:30.384
Like do people say
why or just goodbye?

04:30.386 --> 04:31.186
I don't know.

04:32.187 --> 04:35.189
It probably just said "Fuck
you, I win, love Max."

04:35.456 --> 04:36.990
Oh come on.

04:36.992 --> 04:37.925
Good luck finishing
a crossword puzzle.

04:37.927 --> 04:39.293
Oh my god, totally.

04:39.295 --> 04:41.062
Who does Sundays in pen?

04:42.298 --> 04:43.165
So aggressive.

04:46.701 --> 04:49.872
By the way, I'm so
sorry about your mom.

04:50.973 --> 04:52.238
But I...

04:52.240 --> 04:54.007
Ah, well, that's what
happens when you have

04:54.009 --> 04:57.110
a gastric bypass at 70,
become a late-life alcoholic.

04:57.112 --> 05:00.283
Thought I'd get a jump
on it.

05:01.483 --> 05:02.748
Hey, is Paulie coming?

05:02.750 --> 05:04.017
Yeah, apparently.

05:04.019 --> 05:05.618
Fuck, now they
decide to make up.

05:05.620 --> 05:06.685
Oh, be nice.

05:06.687 --> 05:07.753
I am nice, I'm always nice.

05:07.755 --> 05:08.924
I'm here, aren't I?

05:10.291 --> 05:12.759
Um, I gave you a 50.

05:12.761 --> 05:14.594
No, it was a 20.

05:14.596 --> 05:15.665
Cool.

05:16.432 --> 05:18.397
Okay you keep the change.

05:19.869 --> 05:22.572
All righty, so when do
we board the fun bus?

05:27.475 --> 05:28.944
Are you kidding me?

05:37.153 --> 05:40.990
Excuse me, should I...?

06:00.007 --> 06:01.675
Oh my god it fell all out.

06:01.677 --> 06:03.077
Sorry, I can
taste my teeth.

06:03.079 --> 06:05.312
Mmm, it's airplane pretzels
and house red,

06:05.314 --> 06:07.546
and the recycled air, and the
breathing other people's farts

06:07.548 --> 06:08.647
for four hours.

06:08.649 --> 06:09.983
Haha, for JFK?

06:09.985 --> 06:11.685
Yeah, two on the
runway, two in the air.

06:11.687 --> 06:12.985
It wasn't that bad.

06:12.987 --> 06:14.253
Oh, you were
in first class.

06:14.255 --> 06:15.320
Well, people fart
in first class.

06:15.322 --> 06:16.490
So how are you?

06:16.492 --> 06:18.558
Oh, it's been like
a really long time.

06:18.560 --> 06:19.659
Your wedding.

06:19.661 --> 06:21.094
No.

06:21.096 --> 06:22.562
No, no, there was that
winter in New York.

06:22.564 --> 06:23.663
Oh god, that was like...

06:23.665 --> 06:24.930
Years... ago.

06:24.932 --> 06:26.433
I know, I know.

06:26.435 --> 06:27.834
And I've been meaning to...
and you have kids now,

06:27.836 --> 06:29.668
oh my god, so cute.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.404
You post all those
great pictures.

06:31.406 --> 06:32.572
Yeah, thanks.

06:32.574 --> 06:34.640
And thank you for the flowers.

06:34.642 --> 06:38.647
It's too bad you couldn't
make it to either baby shower.

06:39.814 --> 06:42.848
It was like, impossible
to leave town

06:42.850 --> 06:45.385
with like life stuff and
work, it's been insane.

06:45.387 --> 06:47.122
For the last six years?

06:49.858 --> 06:50.858
I'll have a white wine.

06:51.259 --> 06:54.527
So, suburban life, how's that?

06:54.529 --> 06:56.329
Very good, we're managing.

06:56.331 --> 06:58.932
Managing, sounds promising.

06:58.934 --> 06:59.798
How's your man Chad?

06:59.800 --> 07:00.632
-Brad.

07:00.634 --> 07:01.702
Brad.

07:01.704 --> 07:03.269
So what is it like, uh,

07:03.271 --> 07:06.005
the playdate soccer
practices, dinners at six?

07:06.007 --> 07:07.373
Actually I enjoy it.

07:07.375 --> 07:10.043
It's the most important
job I've ever had.

07:10.045 --> 07:12.245
Good, 'cause
nothing's as important

07:12.247 --> 07:14.113
like a four bedroom
Tudor in Connecticut.

07:14.115 --> 07:16.183
Better than herpes on
a Grateful Dead poncho.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.552
♪ Anyway ♪

07:17.853 --> 07:20.486
That poncho was handcrafted
in the fucking Appalachians.

07:20.488 --> 07:23.223
So, how's the job, Elaine?

07:23.225 --> 07:24.925
Oh, be awesome if I
don't wanna kill myself

07:24.927 --> 07:26.325
by 9:15 in the morning.

07:26.327 --> 07:27.560
And I didn't
give you herpes.

07:27.562 --> 07:28.461
Well somebody did.

07:28.463 --> 07:29.865
And, cut!

07:31.600 --> 07:33.332
Sylvia, hi.

07:33.334 --> 07:35.769
I'm just kidding,
the lighting was terrible.

07:35.771 --> 07:39.072
Oh, you poor thing,
I am so sorry.

07:39.074 --> 07:41.173
Oh, and I did not mean
that thing I just said.

07:41.175 --> 07:42.442
I'm so sorry about Max.

07:42.444 --> 07:44.713
But I remember
that poncho.

07:45.547 --> 07:47.046
Oh god, uh.

07:47.048 --> 07:48.615
Once a filmmaker,
always a filmmaker, huh?

07:48.617 --> 07:50.050
Oh yeah, I guess so.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.584
Sorry, can you
delete that?

07:51.586 --> 07:53.786
How does that, like work?

07:53.788 --> 07:55.055
I mean it's not exactly L.A.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.623
- Larry.
- at least the herpes part...

07:56.625 --> 07:58.257
- I don't actually have...
- No, it's not, is it?

07:58.259 --> 08:00.060
But I just, you know,
I still like to dabble.

08:00.327 --> 08:01.894
...I mean it's not contagious.

08:01.896 --> 08:03.796
That'll
be eight dollars.

08:03.798 --> 08:05.231
Sorry.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.132
My country's overrun
with psychotherapists

08:07.134 --> 08:11.236
and Max, you know, he
liked academic life.

08:11.238 --> 08:12.938
He was the breadwinner, so.

08:12.940 --> 08:15.875
Oh please, I think we'd
all love to get away,

08:15.877 --> 08:17.379
move to Iowa, or...

08:17.879 --> 08:18.812
Wisconsin.

08:18.814 --> 08:19.978
Or Wisconsin.

08:19.980 --> 08:21.649
30 miles from nowhere.

08:22.617 --> 08:25.051
Exactly, I mean if
I never saw another

08:25.053 --> 08:27.620
six-inch cockroach
in the subway.

08:27.622 --> 08:29.923
Oh, no cockroaches here.

08:29.925 --> 08:31.192
The cold kills them.

08:32.693 --> 08:36.094
And it's so civilized and quiet.

08:36.096 --> 08:38.033
Just you and the great outdoors.

08:40.235 --> 08:42.703
Well,
it certainly is now.

08:43.638 --> 08:47.040
Sylvia, I'm so sorry
about Max, it's just...

08:47.042 --> 08:47.940
Awful.

08:47.942 --> 08:48.874
Terrible.

08:48.876 --> 08:49.944
It's so sad.

08:50.144 --> 08:51.544
Do you want a drink?

08:51.546 --> 08:53.949
Oh, no, no, no, I
can't, I can't really.

08:54.948 --> 08:55.983
So what happened?

08:56.418 --> 08:58.852
Unless you don't...
I mean, if it's private...

08:59.120 --> 09:00.987
We should probably get
Paul and head north

09:00.989 --> 09:02.291
before it gets dark.

09:02.724 --> 09:03.757
Sure.

09:03.759 --> 09:04.992
Oh. Wait, what about Jack?

09:04.994 --> 09:06.892
Oh, they missed their flight.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.462
They?

09:08.464 --> 09:11.433
His girlfriend Amber,
apparently she's coming too.

09:11.732 --> 09:12.801
Sweet.

09:26.948 --> 09:27.980
Yo!

09:27.982 --> 09:30.249
Smally Pauly!

09:31.485 --> 09:32.354
Hi!

09:33.522 --> 09:34.621
Get over here!

09:34.623 --> 09:35.521
I...

09:35.523 --> 09:36.355
Your bag.

09:36.357 --> 09:37.225
Uh, yeah.

09:38.927 --> 09:39.961
I'm just...

09:43.899 --> 09:44.966
Hi.

09:45.767 --> 09:47.098
You look great, Paul.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.533
Oh, totally, dude.

09:48.535 --> 09:50.502
Starving social worker
thing looks good on you.

09:50.504 --> 09:51.573
Larry.

09:52.006 --> 09:53.973
What, I'm saying, fancy
dinners make you fucking fat.

09:53.975 --> 09:55.142
You look awesome.

09:55.144 --> 09:57.444
So, how's the practice?

09:57.446 --> 10:00.115
Oh yeah, reporting
live, shrink good.

10:00.381 --> 10:02.748
No, no, that was
a slow news day.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.050
Max would have killed
for a story like that.

10:05.052 --> 10:06.518
It was about the center, not me.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.387
You're still a big
deal though, huh?

10:08.389 --> 10:09.622
Well no.

10:09.624 --> 10:11.590
Yeah, yeah if it's on
NPR it's a big deal.

10:11.592 --> 10:14.262
Trust me I had to hear
enough about it to know.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.743
...but sometimes,
these studies have

10:30.745 --> 10:32.545
unintended consequences.

10:32.547 --> 10:35.983
There are casualties,
psychologically speaking.

10:35.985 --> 10:37.249
Well I don't get
it, why would anyone...

10:37.251 --> 10:38.350
This was a dedicated student

10:38.352 --> 10:40.152
wanting to please a professor.

10:40.154 --> 10:42.022
Even stayed at the
house for a time.

10:42.024 --> 10:44.190
Jesus, sounds like
a fucking prisoner.

10:44.192 --> 10:46.161
Oh, no.

10:46.427 --> 10:47.627
No, no.

10:47.629 --> 10:50.595
It was just images that
might be disturbing

10:50.597 --> 10:52.799
to people with
certain constitutions.

10:52.801 --> 10:53.867
But nothing tactile.

10:53.869 --> 10:55.435
So what happened?

10:55.437 --> 10:58.838
Well I mean he failed,
pathologically speaking.

10:58.840 --> 10:59.906
Did he quit?

10:59.908 --> 11:01.174
He disappeared.

11:01.176 --> 11:03.410
And I mean just gone
without a trace.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.511
The university opened
an investigation

11:05.513 --> 11:08.013
so they canceled
all Max's classes,

11:08.015 --> 11:09.781
his grants dried up overnight.

11:09.783 --> 11:12.184
I mean as you know,
Paul, an incomplete study

11:12.186 --> 11:13.719
is a useless one.

11:13.721 --> 11:14.853
Whoah.

11:14.855 --> 11:15.854
Whoah!

11:15.856 --> 11:17.556
Oh my god.

11:17.558 --> 11:18.223
What was that?

11:18.225 --> 11:19.158
Should we stop?

11:19.160 --> 11:20.594
No, gross, no.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.395
We got a lot of
stray dogs out here.

11:22.397 --> 11:24.030
I'm sorry, I'm not good with...

11:24.032 --> 11:25.398
Blood, yeah we know.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.666
With the economy,
people just

11:26.668 --> 11:28.003
stopped caring for them.

11:29.537 --> 11:31.371
But they do what they
have to do to survive...

11:31.373 --> 11:32.272
-So sad.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.475
...until they don't.

11:34.475 --> 11:36.642
Okay, so how did Max
do it, did you say?

11:36.644 --> 11:38.243
- Larry.
- Dude, come on.

11:38.245 --> 11:40.879
A 1911 Colt 45.

11:40.881 --> 11:43.550
I mean, I don't know from guns,

11:43.552 --> 11:46.288
but that's what
the police told me.

11:47.154 --> 11:49.289
I'm so sorry, Sylvia.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.823
I'm glad we could be here.

11:50.825 --> 11:52.224
We all are.

11:52.226 --> 11:54.762
Those college years
meant the world to Max.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.466
You guys, the McHale Hall Crew.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.602
It was the closest he
ever got to family.

12:03.303 --> 12:06.039
I think he always
knew that you guys

12:06.041 --> 12:07.475
would be there in the end.

12:40.042 --> 12:41.074
I can't believe it.

12:41.076 --> 12:43.209
It looks exactly the same.

12:43.211 --> 12:44.546
Ah, the memories.

12:44.745 --> 12:46.278
This is very <i>Big Chill.</i>

12:46.280 --> 12:47.546
Please, those people
were like a hundred.

12:47.548 --> 12:49.215
Ooh, we're
like a hundred.

12:49.217 --> 12:50.784
And didn't they all
sleep together?

12:51.219 --> 12:52.285
Did they?

12:52.287 --> 12:53.953
I don't know, I'm assuming.

12:53.955 --> 12:55.222
Don't they always?

12:55.224 --> 12:56.623
Don't forget to
sign the guestbook.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.059
Even in death, Max would
wanna know who was here.

12:59.061 --> 13:01.196
He was always a
stickler for detail.

13:01.763 --> 13:04.600
He's not asking for
a fucking cheek swab.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.502
Anyhoo, I put you
all in the loft.

13:09.504 --> 13:11.637
Paul and Larry can
take the twins.

13:11.639 --> 13:14.239
Bess, you and Elaine
can share the queen,

13:14.241 --> 13:15.742
you're good friends.

13:15.744 --> 13:17.477
And I put Jack and his
girlfriend in the back bedroom.

13:17.479 --> 13:18.980
Pssh, per usual.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.748
Max's mother and I will
be in the main house

13:21.750 --> 13:22.949
if you need anything.

13:22.951 --> 13:24.383
Oh, I didn't know
Norma was living here.

13:24.385 --> 13:25.852
She's been staying
here year-round

13:25.854 --> 13:27.453
for the last few months now.

13:27.455 --> 13:29.525
She was having some...

13:30.725 --> 13:35.127
confusion, and Max
was always fascinated

13:35.129 --> 13:36.561
by the aging process,

13:36.563 --> 13:41.370
so she's here but her
mental state is not.

13:41.602 --> 13:43.136
Oh wow.

13:43.138 --> 13:45.139
But you don't turn
away family, so.

13:46.173 --> 13:49.007
Paul, your father,
didn't he have...

13:49.009 --> 13:50.611
Yeah, it's not easy.

14:00.788 --> 14:04.225
Amazing what strain
does to the human brain.

14:06.594 --> 14:08.895
So, uh,
the kitchen's the same.

14:08.897 --> 14:10.563
We're still on well water.

14:10.565 --> 14:13.766
The filtration system is
not what it used to be

14:13.768 --> 14:16.502
so you might catch
a little sediment.

14:16.504 --> 14:20.305
It has its own flavor but
it's drinkable, and oh!

14:20.307 --> 14:21.342
- Oh!
- Ugh.

14:22.043 --> 14:24.145
Oh, for goodness sake.

14:26.246 --> 14:30.885
Maisy!

14:32.187 --> 14:36.258
Maisy, get in here!

14:37.392 --> 14:38.594
Oh, that cat.

14:45.466 --> 14:48.001
Max used to work out
here in the guesthouse.

14:48.003 --> 14:51.271
Maisy would bring him a
dead rat every morning.

14:51.273 --> 14:52.774
Guess she misses him too.

14:53.741 --> 14:55.842
Well anyhoo, it's
one less rat for you

14:55.844 --> 14:57.410
to have to worry about.

14:57.412 --> 15:00.646
Okay, so the cellphones,
they don't work up here.

15:00.648 --> 15:02.381
You'll have to use the landline

15:02.383 --> 15:04.717
if you wanna make outside calls.

15:04.719 --> 15:08.353
I left some menus in case
you want to order food.

15:08.355 --> 15:09.555
There are only two
or three places

15:09.557 --> 15:11.190
that will deliver this far out

15:11.192 --> 15:14.694
so I would say Top Ling's
Chinese is the best of them.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.561
Ooh, I'd kill for a pork bun.

15:16.563 --> 15:18.432
I remember.

15:18.633 --> 15:21.968
Just stay away from
Caldova Lucha.

15:21.970 --> 15:23.401
We're so hard to find

15:23.403 --> 15:25.972
and all they have are
these kids driving.

15:25.974 --> 15:28.373
Half of them never even make it.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.008
God forbid we had
a real emergency.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.846
We'd be decomposing by the
time the cops got here.

15:39.187 --> 15:40.389
Thank you...

15:41.990 --> 15:43.488
All of you, for coming.

15:43.490 --> 15:45.326
It means the world to us.

15:51.932 --> 15:54.334
Wow, she perked
right the fuck up.

15:54.336 --> 15:56.536
I'm exhausted, no
wonder he offed himself.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.036
She's lonely.

15:58.038 --> 15:59.939
She probably hasn't talked
to anyone in months.

15:59.941 --> 16:01.708
Weren't they gonna get a
divorce 10 years ago?

16:01.710 --> 16:03.743
They got married 10 years ago.

16:03.745 --> 16:04.977
Exactly.

16:04.979 --> 16:06.912
Guys, can we focus on
food, I'm starving.

16:06.914 --> 16:09.515
Wow, does Chinese food in
Wisconsin <i>not</i> sound good?

16:09.517 --> 16:12.584
There's Indian
here too and Thai.

16:12.586 --> 16:14.422
It's the midwest, shouldn't
there be cheeseburgers?

16:14.688 --> 16:15.821
Well, they probably
don't deliver

16:15.823 --> 16:17.355
to the middle of
fucking nowhere.

16:17.357 --> 16:18.723
Oh, come on, you loved it here.

16:18.725 --> 16:21.728
You were the slut
of Chez Lehman.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.897
Was I?

16:23.899 --> 16:25.866
It was like
hunting season, man.

16:26.368 --> 16:28.300
Everyone's date was fair game.

16:28.302 --> 16:29.634
Grouch much?

16:29.636 --> 16:31.170
I'm just saying I
always drove home

16:31.172 --> 16:33.573
with a full pack of condoms
and an awkward car trip

16:33.575 --> 16:34.640
to look forward to.

16:36.144 --> 16:38.076
Well dude, you can't spend
four nights in the woods

16:38.078 --> 16:41.214
and spend three of them with
chicks crying on your shoulder.

16:41.216 --> 16:43.584
No one wants to have sex with
their fucking teddy bear.

16:44.051 --> 16:45.550
Yeah, okay.

16:45.552 --> 16:47.353
So, dumplings?

16:47.355 --> 16:48.186
Yes ma'am.

16:48.188 --> 16:49.122
Yes.

16:49.124 --> 16:50.457
Okay, if I have to.

16:55.062 --> 16:56.295
Uh, not a word.

16:56.297 --> 16:57.331
Wait, wait,
wait, hold on.

16:58.131 --> 16:59.198
Not a word.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.166
Sure it is.

17:00.168 --> 17:01.699
- Meaning?
- Bruns.

17:01.701 --> 17:03.603
I don't know what it means,
but I know it's a word.

17:03.605 --> 17:04.737
We'll never
know, will we?

17:04.739 --> 17:06.373
Not without wifi, we won't.

17:06.375 --> 17:09.407
How does a guy with
a PhD not have a dictionary?

17:09.410 --> 17:10.675
Language of the mind.

17:10.678 --> 17:12.077
Words are superfluous.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.613
As are ethics, apparently.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.950
There, there it is.

17:15.982 --> 17:17.018
Did you hear that?

17:17.352 --> 17:18.750
No.

17:18.752 --> 17:20.853
Like a buzzing, I
keep hearing this hum.

17:20.855 --> 17:23.323
Scientists are
always misunderstood.

17:23.325 --> 17:24.489
Like Mengele.

17:24.491 --> 17:25.624
I don't hear anything.

17:25.626 --> 17:26.925
It's gone now.

17:26.928 --> 17:28.628
You seriously equating
Max with a Nazi?

17:28.630 --> 17:30.028
Well, why do you have the
right to torment people

17:30.030 --> 17:31.764
just because you have a
degree and some funding?

17:31.766 --> 17:33.032
They weren't tormenting people,

17:33.034 --> 17:34.499
they vet these
studies, you can't do...

17:34.501 --> 17:35.468
Do they thought?

17:35.470 --> 17:36.538
There!

17:38.240 --> 17:39.307
Where'd it go?

17:41.209 --> 17:43.642
You know, just because you
work with the unwashed masses

17:43.644 --> 17:46.179
doesn't mean that all
shrinks are saints.

17:46.181 --> 17:47.747
Did I say that we were?

17:47.749 --> 17:49.347
Nothing like paying a guy
like 200 dollars an hour

17:49.349 --> 17:50.783
to tell you your life sucks.

17:50.785 --> 17:52.854
Now you're a sad
sack and a sucker.

17:53.253 --> 17:55.054
You would make a
terrible patient.

17:55.056 --> 17:56.422
Damn right.

17:56.424 --> 17:57.790
I don't need some
dick in a turtleneck

17:57.792 --> 17:59.292
to tell me how to
process my feelings.

17:59.294 --> 18:01.192
I don't think people
wear turtlenecks anymore.

18:01.194 --> 18:02.495
No?

18:02.497 --> 18:03.728
Max isn't a dick,
he's a scientist

18:03.730 --> 18:05.030
and he is your friend.

18:05.032 --> 18:06.665
<i>Was,</i> Paul, he was a scientist.

18:06.667 --> 18:07.799
None of us have
seen him in years.

18:07.801 --> 18:09.403
Who knows what he is now?

18:10.538 --> 18:11.673
Dead.

18:13.942 --> 18:14.875
He's dead now.

18:17.144 --> 18:18.645
Okay, whatever.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.480
This kid knew what he
was getting himself into,

18:21.482 --> 18:24.249
otherwise he shouldn't have
signed on the dotted line.

18:24.251 --> 18:26.051
What, what was he like, 18?

18:26.053 --> 18:27.519
Think of us at 18.

18:27.521 --> 18:28.756
<i>Caveat emptor.</i>

18:30.191 --> 18:31.960
Crazy always finds its way out.

18:34.796 --> 18:37.798
Who's ready to party?!

18:38.031 --> 18:39.100
What is up?

18:41.903 --> 18:42.969
Hey Jack.

18:42.971 --> 18:44.603
Oh, baby girl!

18:44.605 --> 18:46.505
There he is!

18:46.507 --> 18:47.774
Hey buddy.

18:47.776 --> 18:49.911
Good to see you, buddy.

18:50.978 --> 18:54.380
Yo, man, how you been?
It's been a long time!

18:54.382 --> 18:56.915
Yeah it's been a
while, I'm good.

18:56.917 --> 18:57.718
Yeah, all right.

18:58.318 --> 19:00.085
Hey, let me help with those.

19:00.087 --> 19:02.188
So you're a model,
is that right?

19:02.190 --> 19:04.055
Give up the dream, Larry!

19:04.057 --> 19:06.728
Once you go Jack,
you never go back.

19:06.994 --> 19:09.897
You got me, I'm a dreamer.

19:10.332 --> 19:11.831
You don't change, man.

19:11.833 --> 19:14.400
Oh thank god, someone
brought booze.

19:14.402 --> 19:16.035
So this is...?

19:16.037 --> 19:16.768
Oh, Amber.

19:16.770 --> 19:19.337
Amber this is everyone.

19:19.339 --> 19:20.940
- Hey.
- Hello.

19:20.942 --> 19:24.679
So, who's ready to
grieve into a 2008 Pinot?

19:25.413 --> 19:27.479
Lucky for you, we went shopping.

19:27.481 --> 19:29.817
We got spray cheese.

19:31.585 --> 19:32.586
Beef jerky.

19:33.020 --> 19:36.490
Glow
in the dark condoms.

19:36.857 --> 19:39.158
So come on, fill me in!

19:39.160 --> 19:41.897
Do we know why this
fucker offed himself?

19:58.045 --> 20:00.145
Yeah, he didn't talk to
me for like two weeks

20:00.147 --> 20:03.682
because I wouldn't fill out
that dumbass sex survey.

20:05.586 --> 20:07.754
Oh god the sex survey.

20:08.722 --> 20:10.989
Am I the only one
who filled that out?

20:12.326 --> 20:13.327
You sucker!

20:14.061 --> 20:16.528
He was like Houdini, man,
he got you every time.

20:16.530 --> 20:18.229
Because it was
flattering though,

20:18.231 --> 20:20.132
I mean I think we all want to
be the subject of something.

20:20.134 --> 20:22.200
The quickest way to get
your ass broken up with

20:22.202 --> 20:24.636
is to be honest about
your sex habits.

20:24.638 --> 20:26.071
Cause and effect, man.

20:26.073 --> 20:28.674
We get dumped because
of his shitty survey

20:28.676 --> 20:30.776
and then he gets his
pick of our exes?

20:30.778 --> 20:32.277
Yeah, pick exes!

20:32.279 --> 20:34.548
Oh he would have loved you.

20:35.282 --> 20:37.082
Absolutely, totally.

20:38.286 --> 20:39.120
Dude.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.386
But what, no, whatever,

20:41.388 --> 20:42.821
that was, it was a psych study.

20:42.823 --> 20:44.824
That wasn't like a sex plot.

20:44.826 --> 20:48.160
Well, you two had your
level of shit going on.

20:49.364 --> 20:51.163
It was college man,
it was competitive.

20:51.165 --> 20:53.967
Yeah, then you had to
rat him out to the IRB

20:53.969 --> 20:56.035
for quoting a fucking
science journal.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.902
It was a little more
than just a quote.

20:57.904 --> 20:58.970
Well it's none of your business

20:58.972 --> 21:00.573
is what it was, Mr. Rogers.

21:00.575 --> 21:01.539
Or was it?

21:01.541 --> 21:03.409
Guys, shut up.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.447
Got you the grant
though, didn't it?

21:07.449 --> 21:09.748
Yeah, it did, because
you don't get funding

21:09.750 --> 21:10.982
unless you have numbers.

21:10.984 --> 21:13.251
Right, which you're
not gonna have

21:13.253 --> 21:14.819
if all your friends
are ratting you out.

21:14.821 --> 21:16.488
Oh Larry, come on.

21:16.490 --> 21:18.390
I apologized, okay?

21:18.392 --> 21:19.926
I'm still apologizing.

21:19.928 --> 21:22.061
Hey, you don't have to
apologize to me, man.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.596
Pickaxe for a pickin' ass!

21:28.469 --> 21:29.835
Oh yes.

21:29.837 --> 21:32.604
Shirt down, babe, we
can see your tits!

21:32.606 --> 21:33.838
Thank you for that.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.309
Do you need help with those?

21:35.876 --> 21:37.478
- Oh, I do.
- Yo!

21:37.912 --> 21:42.014
Okay, the only way that

21:42.016 --> 21:44.816
having sex with a stranger
does not count as cheating

21:44.818 --> 21:47.719
is if you're a hooker.

21:47.721 --> 21:50.222
Then it's like
your nine to five.

21:54.428 --> 21:56.965
Holy shit,
what the hell is that?

21:58.398 --> 22:00.334
Whoah, whoah, whoah,
where you going, dude?

22:02.636 --> 22:03.602
It's a woman.

22:03.604 --> 22:04.670
It's a ghost.

22:04.672 --> 22:05.906
Why is he talking to it?

22:09.176 --> 22:10.642
- Holy shit!
- What the hell?

22:11.878 --> 22:13.379
Oh my god,
is that a wolf?

22:14.648 --> 22:15.948
Get out of here!

22:15.950 --> 22:18.385
Go on, shoo!

22:18.586 --> 22:20.620
Do you have dogs?

22:20.622 --> 22:22.654
No, she's just an alpha.

22:22.656 --> 22:23.991
I can also be beta.

22:25.759 --> 22:27.892
Oh, I totally have
the shakes, dudes.

22:27.894 --> 22:29.228
Oh, shit like detox shakes?

22:29.230 --> 22:30.997
'cause I think I
killed the bottle.

22:30.999 --> 22:32.264
How many does that make?

22:32.266 --> 22:33.565
Oh don't judge.

22:33.567 --> 22:34.665
I'm the only one here with
no hope of getting laid.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.067
Hello, married.

22:36.069 --> 22:38.403
I don't think pork
buns is getting laid.

22:38.405 --> 22:42.109
It's a funeral, you really
wanna get laid at a funeral?

22:46.146 --> 22:47.147
That was Norma.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.951
She said she was
looking for Max.

22:50.852 --> 22:53.017
She didn't even recognize me.

22:53.019 --> 22:55.554
Oh, what was in those pork buns?

22:55.556 --> 22:57.288
Bartendo, what have we got?

22:57.290 --> 23:02.296
Ah, whiskey, two
lights and a zinfandel.

23:02.730 --> 23:03.765
Larry?

23:04.765 --> 23:06.565
Top Ling just tried to kill me.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.835
I want red, white,
and a little bit of Jack.

23:10.837 --> 23:12.371
Oh you want a
little bit of Jack?

23:12.373 --> 23:13.372
You want a bit of Jack?

23:13.374 --> 23:14.373
Come here.

23:28.455 --> 23:29.890
Oh shit!

23:36.596 --> 23:39.901
What the fuck?

23:40.401 --> 23:43.672
What the...?

23:50.377 --> 23:51.245
Oh fuck.

23:55.482 --> 23:56.882
Whoah, you all right?

23:56.884 --> 23:58.284
Yeah fine, fine.

23:58.286 --> 23:59.884
I'm just getting used
to the well water.

23:59.886 --> 24:02.153
Oh yeah, it's like
an egg being filtered

24:02.155 --> 24:03.588
through a fucking diaper.

24:03.590 --> 24:05.690
Yeah, hey, was anyone in
the basement just now?

24:05.692 --> 24:09.294
Uh, not unless that kid
came back for his dignity.

24:09.296 --> 24:10.796
Larry.

24:10.798 --> 24:11.965
Bessie.

24:15.502 --> 24:17.004
What's up, you're tense.

24:18.740 --> 24:20.572
Yeah, I wonder why.

24:20.574 --> 24:23.144
Yeah, dead friend.

24:24.679 --> 24:26.911
Are you missing
the little people?

24:26.913 --> 24:28.380
The rocky marriage?

24:28.382 --> 24:29.248
What?

24:29.250 --> 24:30.282
Oh please.

24:30.284 --> 24:31.482
We're managing?

24:31.484 --> 24:34.253
I mean, I know a sinking
ship when I see one.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.891
Believe me, I've
sunk two of them.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.458
Karen, oh, really?

24:39.460 --> 24:40.992
Yeah, it's all over
but the signing.

24:40.994 --> 24:44.263
Oh Larry, I'm
sorry, that's awful.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.100
Yeah.

24:46.799 --> 24:48.001
It's not so bad.

24:49.170 --> 24:52.774
Off, what do you say we
revisit the summer of '05?

24:56.042 --> 24:57.377
You have puke breath.

24:59.413 --> 25:00.781
Goddammit.

25:14.362 --> 25:15.460
Oh my god!

25:15.462 --> 25:16.629
What happened?!

25:16.631 --> 25:18.529
Oh my god, there's
somebody out there.

25:18.531 --> 25:19.399
Oh my god.

25:22.036 --> 25:23.971
He was on the balcony.

25:26.207 --> 25:29.775
He was there up against
the glass like a vampire.

25:29.777 --> 25:30.842
A hot one?

25:30.844 --> 25:32.044
What?

25:32.046 --> 25:34.313
Babe, you're tired.

25:34.315 --> 25:37.015
No, there's somebody out there!

25:37.017 --> 25:37.917
Did you see a ladder?

25:37.919 --> 25:39.384
No.

25:39.386 --> 25:41.990
Did you see wings?

25:42.190 --> 25:44.458
Oh my god, fuck you!

25:45.393 --> 25:48.462
'Cause you know last time I
checked, man couldn't fly.

26:03.144 --> 26:06.411
I can't believe I
forgot she does this.

26:06.413 --> 26:08.817
We used to call
it pulling a Cho.

26:10.417 --> 26:14.319
Well, I mean we could just
like adjust her, right?

26:14.321 --> 26:16.388
Please, I've lifted her off
the bathroom floor before.

26:16.390 --> 26:18.226
She's like a concrete slab.

26:19.859 --> 26:21.259
Okay well, I'll sleep with her,

26:21.261 --> 26:23.230
and you can push the
twins together.

26:24.498 --> 26:26.898
After 20
years of wussing out,

26:26.900 --> 26:29.267
now you're gonna make your move?

26:29.269 --> 26:31.636
I will leave my clothes on.

26:31.638 --> 26:33.838
Of course you will.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.806
No, no, we'll take the twins.

26:35.808 --> 26:36.944
Like old times.

26:40.580 --> 26:42.547
Why are we always the
ones stuck in the balcony

26:42.549 --> 26:44.482
while everyone else
played the sick card

26:44.484 --> 26:48.653
or fucked their faces off
in the actual bedroom?

26:48.655 --> 26:50.221
Yeah, that sounds familiar.

26:50.223 --> 26:52.090
I mean I didn't really
have any options, but you...

26:52.092 --> 26:54.961
No, I was surrounded by wolves.

26:55.461 --> 26:58.063
Well the pack leader
ain't getting any tonight,

26:58.065 --> 27:00.168
not after those pork buns.

27:06.339 --> 27:08.009
This room used to be dark.

27:08.942 --> 27:10.677
Seems exactly the same.

27:10.912 --> 27:13.277
Just a little older.

27:13.279 --> 27:14.345
A little drunker.

27:14.347 --> 27:15.884
And without all the baggage.

27:19.653 --> 27:21.389
Yeah right.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.261
Good night.

27:28.195 --> 27:30.497
Good night, E.

27:31.832 --> 27:33.899
Can you tell me a story?

27:33.901 --> 27:35.100
-No.

27:35.102 --> 27:36.704
Come on, a short story.

27:36.971 --> 27:38.871
Sleeping time.

27:38.873 --> 27:41.042
- That's my face.
- I know.

28:30.357 --> 28:31.190
Morning!

28:31.192 --> 28:32.425
Hope you slept okay.

28:32.759 --> 28:34.793
Oh yeah... hi!

28:34.795 --> 28:35.893
What time is it?

28:35.895 --> 28:37.030
Breakfast time.

28:37.964 --> 28:40.465
Oh Sylvia, we should
be taking care of <i>you.</i>

28:40.467 --> 28:43.668
Oh, no, no, don't be silly,

28:43.670 --> 28:45.170
you're my guests.

28:45.172 --> 28:46.774
Who is it?

28:47.307 --> 28:48.707
Just thought you might
need a little something

28:48.709 --> 28:50.042
to soak up the booze.

28:50.044 --> 28:53.112
Oh no, I'm so
sorry, were we loud?

28:53.114 --> 28:57.516
No, no, I just figured
old college crowd.

28:57.518 --> 29:00.286
Max always said you
guys were a little wild.

29:00.288 --> 29:02.121
Oh you should have joined us.

29:02.123 --> 29:04.189
No, no, I
don't drink anymore.

29:04.191 --> 29:05.259
Oh god.

29:11.064 --> 29:12.663
Babe?

29:12.665 --> 29:13.533
You okay?

29:15.236 --> 29:18.103
So I picked these up in town.

29:18.105 --> 29:19.371
People are closing down early,

29:19.373 --> 29:21.873
what with the weather coming in.

29:21.875 --> 29:24.176
Is it supposed to rain?

29:24.178 --> 29:29.349
Rain, hail, maybe a
tornado if we're lucky.

29:29.950 --> 29:32.219
We call it flood season.

29:33.319 --> 29:36.254
Sometimes it's best to
just lock up and sit tight.

29:39.326 --> 29:40.892
Oh wow, I'm sure, so...

29:40.894 --> 29:44.031
Of course the dead don't
wait on the rain, do they?

29:48.434 --> 29:50.770
I'll be back in a bit to
pick you up for the service.

29:51.238 --> 29:52.774
Ow.

30:10.457 --> 30:12.460
That is so loud.

30:14.560 --> 30:15.994
I don't think it's
ever even worked.

30:15.996 --> 30:18.699
There's probably produce
from 1998 down there.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.632
Oh, wow.

30:21.634 --> 30:23.636
Who throws up in
the kitchen sink?

30:23.837 --> 30:26.771
Says the man who spent half
the night in the bathroom.

30:26.773 --> 30:28.006
How dare you.

30:28.008 --> 30:29.874
I was poisoned by pork buns.

30:29.876 --> 30:35.081
That woman was poisoned by
wine and youth and stupidity.

30:35.282 --> 30:37.615
Ah, she was nervous, she's 23.

30:37.617 --> 30:38.984
Pretty sure I was
waking up in a pool

30:38.986 --> 30:41.019
of my own vomit at 23.

30:41.021 --> 30:42.421
I remember, you were.

30:42.423 --> 30:44.525
Now I have the tolerance
of an Irish seaman.

30:44.959 --> 30:48.293
Vomit aside, I was
thinking I might tap that.

30:48.295 --> 30:49.428
Oh Larry.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.929
I am kidding.

30:50.931 --> 30:52.597
You've been stealing
girlfriends for 20 years.

30:52.599 --> 30:54.167
Give someone else a chance.

30:54.433 --> 30:56.170
Who?

30:57.003 --> 30:58.469
Fuck me.

30:58.471 --> 31:00.540
I guess the storm's coming in.

31:12.053 --> 31:13.187
That's better.

31:14.855 --> 31:15.690
That's nice.

31:21.295 --> 31:22.494
Hi!

31:22.496 --> 31:25.663
Hi, sorry, sorry, did I, sorry.

31:25.665 --> 31:27.999
I thought I'd bring
aspirin and some water,

31:28.001 --> 31:31.336
a little hair of the dog,
if you're so inclined.

31:31.338 --> 31:34.038
Oh yes, doggy needs some hair.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.243
Okay here you go.

31:42.215 --> 31:43.815
Do you want
the aspirin bit, too?

31:43.817 --> 31:44.652
-Oh yeah.

31:47.820 --> 31:48.987
Was it bad?

31:48.989 --> 31:50.423
Which part?

31:53.359 --> 31:55.695
I kind of threw up a little bit.

31:55.895 --> 31:57.764
Oh my god, you did?

31:59.232 --> 32:00.565
Okay, in the sink, yeah.

32:00.567 --> 32:02.767
It's better than in the fridge.

32:02.769 --> 32:03.901
I guess, yeah.

32:03.903 --> 32:05.770
Besides you made
Larry feel better.

32:05.772 --> 32:08.373
He thinks we forgot he was
shitting pork buns all night.

32:08.375 --> 32:10.842
I just, I don't
usually drink whiskey.

32:10.844 --> 32:13.978
I'm more of a pink
wine kind of girl.

32:13.980 --> 32:16.515
Well, desperate times.

32:16.517 --> 32:19.250
Oh my god,
do I seem desperate?

32:19.252 --> 32:20.885
No, no, no, it's a quote.

32:20.887 --> 32:22.754
Oh my god, 'cause I usually
drink when I get nervous.

32:22.756 --> 32:24.855
And then I saw that
thing in the window.

32:24.857 --> 32:26.292
-I get it.

32:26.294 --> 32:29.630
It's kind of hard to be the
newbie among crazy people.

32:32.266 --> 32:34.599
Jack gets really annoyed.

32:34.601 --> 32:37.738
Please, he's lucky to have you.

32:39.538 --> 32:41.875
At least I kept my
clothes on, right?

32:43.443 --> 32:45.278
Oh my god, he's gonna kill me.

32:45.479 --> 32:47.144
No, it was nothing.

32:47.146 --> 32:48.446
I mean you flashed us.

32:48.448 --> 32:49.715
-Oh that's so embarrassing.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.283
But it was super
fast, like too fast.

32:51.285 --> 32:55.389
And no, it's not, because
you have... a great rack.

32:56.757 --> 32:57.756
Really?

32:57.758 --> 32:58.625
Totally.

32:59.460 --> 33:00.760
Thank you.

33:01.428 --> 33:02.896
You're welcome.

33:03.864 --> 33:08.236
Maybe you should get drunk
and nervous more often.

34:11.965 --> 34:13.097
What the hell?

34:13.099 --> 34:14.233
Jack, what are you doing?

34:14.235 --> 34:15.400
I thought you might need help.

34:15.402 --> 34:16.737
No, I'm good.

34:17.170 --> 34:21.239
Baby, I know you're having
trouble reaching your back.

34:21.242 --> 34:22.842
Knock it off, give me a towel.

34:23.777 --> 34:26.480
Hey, summer of '02,
what do you say?

34:26.914 --> 34:30.114
Jack, it's his
funeral, I'm not gonna...

34:30.117 --> 34:31.248
What, cheat on him again?

34:31.251 --> 34:32.119
Yeah.

34:32.385 --> 34:33.784
Come on, babe.

34:33.786 --> 34:35.786
There's a statute of
limitations on all that.

34:35.789 --> 34:37.891
Especially when the
injured party is dead.

34:38.791 --> 34:40.994
You have a girlfriend
in the other room.

34:41.393 --> 34:42.927
So?

34:42.929 --> 34:45.597
So, she was vomiting,
maybe you should go and...

34:45.599 --> 34:46.934
We could go canoeing.

34:48.534 --> 34:50.202
Maybe you should
go check on her.

34:50.204 --> 34:52.505
I won't tell Max if you don't.

35:25.572 --> 35:27.742
Mmm, that feels good.

35:28.474 --> 35:29.909
Mm, totally.

35:30.577 --> 35:31.645
Who knew?

35:32.612 --> 35:35.148
As a kid, I used to love
having my arm tickled.

35:36.849 --> 35:38.652
But the neck feels good too.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.262
What the hell, what happened?

35:51.264 --> 35:52.329
Cockroaches!

35:52.331 --> 35:53.731
There were fucking cockroaches!

35:53.733 --> 35:55.200
Oh my god, there was
like thousands of them,

35:55.202 --> 35:56.170
they're everywhere!

35:56.469 --> 35:57.501
They're bugs, Amber.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.269
I know they're bugs, Jack.

35:59.271 --> 36:00.572
Why are you wet?

36:00.574 --> 36:01.873
What's up,
what's going on?

36:01.875 --> 36:02.974
There are cockroaches
in the bed!

36:02.976 --> 36:03.708
What?

36:03.710 --> 36:05.110
In our bed, ugh!

36:05.112 --> 36:06.376
That's disgusting, I
thought there weren't...

36:06.378 --> 36:07.845
No, it's a lie.

36:07.847 --> 36:09.414
Cockroaches do not
die in Wisconsin.

36:09.416 --> 36:11.282
They come inside to get
warm in your fucking seat.

36:11.284 --> 36:13.219
Oh god I feel like
there's one in my mouth.

36:13.619 --> 36:14.619
Wait, there was a cockroach?

36:14.621 --> 36:16.054
Not a cockroach, Paul!

36:16.056 --> 36:17.287
Like 60 of them!

36:17.289 --> 36:18.188
And they were...

36:18.190 --> 36:19.289
On you, we get it.

36:19.291 --> 36:21.224
Just calm down, so we can...

36:21.226 --> 36:22.293
Get out of here?

36:22.295 --> 36:23.728
We're not going anywhere, babe.

36:23.730 --> 36:25.496
We got a funeral to go to.

36:25.498 --> 36:26.630
I didn't know him.

36:26.632 --> 36:28.066
I'm not going.

36:28.934 --> 36:30.969
In the woods, they're bugs.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.970
Maybe the wind just
blew something open.

36:32.972 --> 36:34.371
Like your pants?

36:34.373 --> 36:35.576
Shit.

36:41.914 --> 36:43.347
It's like the end of
the world out there.

36:43.349 --> 36:45.516
Nope, just
Wisconsin in October.

36:45.518 --> 36:47.020
Jesus, she's like a ninja.

36:47.887 --> 36:50.591
Okay, time to say our goodbyes.

36:57.664 --> 36:59.664
We are here to
celebrate the life

36:59.666 --> 37:01.934
of Maxwell Lehman,

37:01.936 --> 37:05.840
who now returns to his home
with our God, the Father.

37:07.940 --> 37:12.344
With each flower, we give
our love, our hearts,

37:12.346 --> 37:15.347
our commitment to
cherish your memory.

37:16.215 --> 37:19.752
May you find more peace
among God's angels

37:21.221 --> 37:27.628
and may your tortured soul
find solace in the afterlife.

37:29.161 --> 37:29.827
Here you go.

37:29.829 --> 37:30.994
Thanks, I'll...

37:30.996 --> 37:32.331
- No, for the coffin.
- Sure.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.331
No, that's okay, that's okay.

37:34.333 --> 37:35.967
I didn't really know him.

37:35.969 --> 37:38.771
No, any friends of Jack's
is a friend of Max, please.

37:49.449 --> 37:50.518
Um.

37:51.851 --> 37:53.985
These guys really miss you,

37:53.987 --> 37:56.923
and, uh, wherever you are...

38:08.802 --> 38:10.004
Oh my god!

38:11.271 --> 38:12.673
Grab my hand!

38:13.606 --> 38:15.505
Grab my hand, give me your hand!

38:15.507 --> 38:16.576
Amber!

38:34.827 --> 38:36.896
Well, it was a
very nice service,

38:38.264 --> 38:41.432
- all things considered.
- Short and sweet.

38:41.434 --> 38:43.901
Max was never one for sentiment.

38:43.903 --> 38:46.637
I just wish that his
colleagues had come,

38:46.639 --> 38:48.342
you know, show a little remorse.

38:50.577 --> 38:54.378
Scientist can be so cold-hearted
when they want to be.

38:54.380 --> 38:55.249
I remember.

38:56.382 --> 38:58.619
Milk-livered man.

38:59.253 --> 39:02.253
Thou bear'st a cheek for
blows, a head for wrongs.

39:02.255 --> 39:03.121
-Norma, please.

39:03.123 --> 39:04.625
Pluck out his eyes!

39:05.492 --> 39:07.825
She thinks that she's
back in Pittsburgh,

39:07.827 --> 39:08.726
doing some kind of...

39:08.728 --> 39:09.797
King Lear.

39:11.231 --> 39:13.267
We did it in my
cold reading class.

39:14.534 --> 39:17.003
Madness can be so unforgiving.

39:18.304 --> 39:21.673
You just gotta hope it's
not genetic, right Paul?

39:21.675 --> 39:22.740
I'm sorry?

39:22.742 --> 39:24.945
Your dad, with his early onset.

39:27.213 --> 39:28.081
Mmm.

39:29.416 --> 39:31.952
Stink... shit.

39:33.353 --> 39:34.385
Eggs!

39:34.387 --> 39:35.788
See it can happen so fast.

39:37.590 --> 39:38.555
Max!

39:38.557 --> 39:40.293
Max is dead, Norma.

39:41.393 --> 39:42.261
He's dead.

39:47.233 --> 39:49.066
She gets this way, I'm sorry.

39:49.068 --> 39:49.934
No, no.

39:49.936 --> 39:51.771
I think it's time for us to go.

39:58.311 --> 40:00.948
So what the hell is that
about your dad, dude?

40:02.248 --> 40:03.380
Doesn't matter.

40:03.382 --> 40:04.449
Oh, come on.

40:04.451 --> 40:05.885
I thought it was shitty.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.155
People grieve in
different ways, you know.

40:10.322 --> 40:12.523
When my dog Sparky died,
I got drunk for a week

40:12.525 --> 40:14.394
and I went skeet shooting.

40:16.596 --> 40:19.065
I've never gone skeet
shooting a day in my life.

40:20.132 --> 40:22.168
Death does strange
things to people.

40:25.338 --> 40:26.206
Fuck!

40:26.472 --> 40:28.139
Why is it freezing in here?

40:28.141 --> 40:30.340
Where is the fucking firewood?

40:30.342 --> 40:31.575
Out there.

40:31.577 --> 40:32.946
Oh, no thank you.

40:34.347 --> 40:35.679
I'll go.

40:35.681 --> 40:36.683
I'll go.

40:37.884 --> 40:38.950
What?

40:38.952 --> 40:40.083
I'm the perfect human.

40:40.085 --> 40:41.887
I work in non-profit.

40:42.121 --> 40:44.354
I just offered to go get wood.

40:44.356 --> 40:45.389
You're welcome.

40:45.391 --> 40:46.758
It's not his fault
he's chivalrous

40:46.760 --> 40:47.825
and you're a dick, Larry.

40:47.827 --> 40:49.661
Hey, at least I still have mine.

40:49.663 --> 40:51.762
You seen the size of those
fucking ticks out there?

40:51.764 --> 40:53.231
They don't want
your dick, trust me.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.499
How would you know?

40:54.501 --> 40:56.403
Yeah, we really missed out.

40:57.436 --> 40:58.271
You didn't.

40:59.539 --> 41:01.074
Whatever, not worth it.

41:01.574 --> 41:03.173
Ever the pacifist.

41:03.175 --> 41:05.376
Why, because I don't care
about your tick-bait dick?

41:05.378 --> 41:07.012
No, because you don't
care that someone

41:07.014 --> 41:08.345
called your dad crazy and said

41:08.347 --> 41:09.947
it's only a matter
of time for you!

41:09.949 --> 41:11.548
The woman is grieving, man,

41:11.550 --> 41:12.684
she just lost her husband!

41:12.686 --> 41:14.117
I'm not gonna be
a jerk about it!

41:14.119 --> 41:15.686
No, of course not.

41:15.688 --> 41:17.387
It would ruin your reputation
as a fucking saint!

41:17.389 --> 41:20.023
Shut up, you don't know
what you're talking about.

41:20.025 --> 41:21.425
There it is, there
it is, let it out.

41:21.427 --> 41:22.730
Fuck you!

41:23.797 --> 41:26.032
Okay, you satisfied,
prick, fuck you.

41:27.766 --> 41:28.666
Hey!

41:28.668 --> 41:29.870
Hey, hey, stop it.

41:34.373 --> 41:37.141
Well, there goes
your peace prize.

41:37.143 --> 41:38.842
I'll come with you, Paul.

41:38.844 --> 41:40.146
Let's go get tick bit.

41:48.822 --> 41:50.121
Don't pay attention.

41:50.123 --> 41:51.759
They do this all the time.

41:56.996 --> 41:58.432
Where are they going?

41:58.965 --> 41:59.963
For a screw.

41:59.965 --> 42:01.168
Yeah right.

42:01.934 --> 42:03.833
So she dates girls, right?

42:03.835 --> 42:05.471
Most lesbians do.

42:07.139 --> 42:08.673
Paul's really nice.

42:08.675 --> 42:10.374
And so is Mr. Rogers.

42:10.376 --> 42:11.110
Who?

42:11.644 --> 42:14.077
That old dude that used
to ride tiny trains

42:14.079 --> 42:16.083
with a bunch of puppets on them?

42:16.983 --> 42:18.284
That's really creepy.

42:18.617 --> 42:19.883
Exactly.

42:20.954 --> 42:22.452
That's why I always come on

42:22.454 --> 42:25.990
when you least... expect it.

42:27.994 --> 42:29.396
Oh, Jesus fuck!

42:29.862 --> 42:33.331
Oh man damn, that was... fuck.

42:40.873 --> 42:42.474
It's a raccoon.

42:42.476 --> 42:43.943
The size of a horse?

42:45.010 --> 42:47.047
Damn, how many of
them are there?

42:52.751 --> 42:54.684
Oh my god, that's him.

42:54.686 --> 42:55.954
What, who?

42:55.956 --> 42:56.954
Him!

42:56.956 --> 42:57.887
What about him?

42:57.889 --> 42:59.590
That's the man.

42:59.592 --> 43:00.825
That's the man that I saw.

43:00.827 --> 43:01.791
In this picture?

43:01.793 --> 43:03.293
No, in the window.

43:03.295 --> 43:04.662
Babe, have some water.

43:04.664 --> 43:06.731
No, no, I saw him yesterday.

43:06.733 --> 43:07.898
And today I thought...

43:07.900 --> 43:09.367
It couldn't be.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.370
Why not?

43:11.503 --> 43:13.104
'Cause that's Max.

43:13.106 --> 43:14.704
Who's Max?

43:14.706 --> 43:16.941
Max, the guy we just buried.

43:16.943 --> 43:18.041
He's dead.

43:18.043 --> 43:18.976
Very dead.

43:18.978 --> 43:20.545
Not anymore.

43:22.382 --> 43:23.548
Ooh!

43:23.550 --> 43:24.985
Man it sucks out there.

43:25.751 --> 43:27.818
You guys okay?

43:27.820 --> 43:29.854
Yeah, yeah we're fine.

43:29.856 --> 43:31.859
Just a little tipsy.

43:32.724 --> 43:33.993
As you should be.

43:37.297 --> 43:38.862
Man, the window in
the kitchen busted.

43:38.864 --> 43:40.731
Yeah, 'cause it's a
fucking thousand years old.

43:40.733 --> 43:42.066
All right, I'm gonna
call a cab.

43:42.068 --> 43:43.767
Huh, I don't blame you.

43:43.769 --> 43:44.871
Can I come?

43:45.471 --> 43:47.472
Oh yeah, because
they're everywhere.

43:47.474 --> 43:50.407
Just hop on down the corner
and fucking hail one.

43:50.409 --> 43:52.411
Okay, well I'm not staying here.

43:52.679 --> 43:53.744
We're in Wisconsin, babe.

43:53.746 --> 43:55.612
We're in the middle of nowhere.

43:55.614 --> 43:57.182
You wanted to come.

43:57.184 --> 43:59.617
I want to milk cows,
I want to eat cheese.

43:59.619 --> 44:01.184
I didn't know that
we'd be in a shack

44:01.186 --> 44:02.720
in the middle of the woods

44:02.722 --> 44:05.155
with fucking dead people
and rabid dogs in the walls!

44:05.157 --> 44:06.590
Well it's not really a shack.

44:06.592 --> 44:07.758
I said it was rustic!

44:07.760 --> 44:09.760
This is not rustic, Jack.

44:09.762 --> 44:11.128
This is survival!

44:13.699 --> 44:14.567
Hello?

44:15.501 --> 44:19.405
Hi, I need a cab to
the airport please.

44:21.675 --> 44:23.210
No, I know, I know.

44:24.677 --> 44:25.943
Where are we?

44:25.945 --> 44:26.978
The Lehman house.

44:26.980 --> 44:27.778
The Lehman house.

44:27.780 --> 44:28.713
Black Hill road.

44:28.715 --> 44:30.050
On Black Hill road.

44:34.019 --> 44:35.489
Hello?

44:36.588 --> 44:37.456
Hello?

44:40.126 --> 44:42.358
Maybe there's service
in the main house.

44:42.360 --> 44:43.996
Or Sylvia could drive us.

44:44.297 --> 44:45.896
The woman just
buried her husband.

44:45.898 --> 44:48.532
We can't ask her to drive
30 miles in a rainstorm.

44:48.534 --> 44:50.001
That's what happens
when you live

44:50.003 --> 44:51.434
in the middle of
the fucking boonies.

44:51.436 --> 44:52.802
You have to drive people
places, deal with it.

44:52.804 --> 44:54.371
Dude, let it go.

44:54.373 --> 44:56.039
If you wanna act like a
pussy, do it on your own time.

44:56.041 --> 44:58.508
I didn't cheat a dead guy out
of a fucking science grant

44:58.510 --> 45:00.510
20 years ago, I have
nothing to apologize for

45:00.512 --> 45:01.845
so don't include
me in your fucking

45:01.847 --> 45:03.347
never ending <i>mea culpa.</i>

45:03.349 --> 45:05.016
So sleeping with his
girlfriends doesn't count?

45:05.018 --> 45:06.550
Oh Jesus, it was
college, asshole,

45:06.552 --> 45:08.355
who didn't sleep
with his girlfriends?

45:08.755 --> 45:09.690
You did?

45:10.489 --> 45:11.255
What?

45:11.257 --> 45:13.157
No, I... maybe.

45:13.159 --> 45:14.858
I don't know.

45:14.860 --> 45:16.092
We're here, okay.

45:16.094 --> 45:17.729
We all did shit
we're not proud of

45:17.731 --> 45:18.963
but we're here now so can we
please try to be civilized

45:18.965 --> 45:20.197
for a goddamn second?

45:20.199 --> 45:22.398
And who the fuck
finished the wine?

45:22.400 --> 45:24.501
You have a drinking problem.

45:24.503 --> 45:25.336
No fucking duh.

45:25.338 --> 45:26.704
Who the hell has a funeral

45:26.706 --> 45:27.972
in the middle of the
damn woods anyway?

45:27.974 --> 45:29.240
Oh Max does, of course he does.

45:29.242 --> 45:30.809
God forbid he make
anything easy.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.342
It's like making people
go to your wedding

45:32.344 --> 45:34.513
in Columbus, Ohio
on New Years Eve.

45:34.780 --> 45:35.912
You didn't have to come, Larry.

45:35.914 --> 45:37.481
No one dragged you there.

45:37.483 --> 45:39.150
The roads are closed, Amber.

45:39.152 --> 45:40.083
No one's gonna drive you.

45:40.085 --> 45:41.487
Then I'll walk.

45:44.590 --> 45:46.759
Fine, go.

45:48.994 --> 45:50.961
You wanna go?!

45:50.963 --> 45:52.128
Hey, whoah.

45:52.130 --> 45:52.963
- You wanna go.
- Don't touch me!

45:52.965 --> 45:53.998
Relax!

45:54.000 --> 45:55.432
Hey, if you wanna go, go.

45:55.434 --> 45:57.668
You can't even catch the
right train to Brooklyn.

45:57.670 --> 46:00.271
You think you're gonna
find the fucking airport?

46:00.273 --> 46:01.541
Good luck!

46:02.574 --> 46:03.807
Oh, come on!

46:03.809 --> 46:05.012
What the fuck?

46:06.612 --> 46:07.912
I'm sorry.

46:07.914 --> 46:11.081
I tried to call but
the lines are down.

46:11.083 --> 46:12.650
Yeah, we got that.

46:12.652 --> 46:15.355
Nature's way of telling
us to unplug I guess.

46:18.023 --> 46:19.691
Any trouble with the rooms?

46:19.693 --> 46:20.758
Actually, kind of, yeah.

46:20.760 --> 46:21.825
Do you have...

46:21.827 --> 46:22.661
-Yeah, the kitchen window broke.

46:22.996 --> 46:25.396
Oh geez.

46:25.398 --> 46:27.498
We're fine.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.367
We're actually not fucking fine.

46:29.369 --> 46:32.869
Oh geez, I am
sorry, the windows.

46:32.871 --> 46:34.238
But don't worry about it.

46:34.240 --> 46:35.507
We can just use one of these.

46:35.509 --> 46:37.409
I brought these
tarps, in case, um,

46:38.577 --> 46:42.246
we had some leaking in the
crawlspace a while back

46:42.248 --> 46:45.249
and I'm a little worried
about the foundation.

46:45.251 --> 46:47.717
Of the fucking house?

46:47.719 --> 46:49.755
Under it, really.

46:50.922 --> 46:53.791
Oh is that the animal
farm you got down there?

46:53.793 --> 46:57.026
'Cause they were having a
fucking dance party earlier.

46:57.028 --> 46:59.197
Oh, I don't think so.

46:59.199 --> 47:01.268
An animal could
barely fit in there.

47:02.168 --> 47:03.434
We used to have raccoons

47:03.436 --> 47:05.605
but Max chased those
away years ago.

47:06.271 --> 47:07.905
No.

47:07.907 --> 47:10.874
No, the only thing that's
there is old boxes and dust.

47:10.876 --> 47:12.876
Huh, well this was not dust.

47:12.878 --> 47:15.545
It was like a couple
fat guys on a treadmill.

47:15.547 --> 47:18.481
So you might wanna maybe
reset your traps or something.

47:18.483 --> 47:20.583
We don't really do traps.

47:20.585 --> 47:22.420
The only killing
that we do out here

47:22.422 --> 47:24.124
is of the mercy variety.

47:24.891 --> 47:26.289
Oh my god.

47:26.291 --> 47:29.459
Anyhoo, here are
the tarps, Paul.

47:29.461 --> 47:31.795
If you don't mind
checking the crawlspace

47:31.797 --> 47:33.097
when you get a chance.

47:33.099 --> 47:37.504
It's just no handyman till
after the storm passes.

47:38.170 --> 47:40.606
Yeah, mmhmm, yeah sure.

47:41.039 --> 47:42.106
Great.

47:42.108 --> 47:44.941
It's through the carport.

47:44.943 --> 47:48.815
And, um... under the house.

47:50.849 --> 47:52.016
Great.

47:52.284 --> 47:53.950
Listen, Sylvia.

47:53.952 --> 47:57.454
A few of us were thinking about
heading out a little early,

47:57.456 --> 47:59.456
you know just get ahead
of the rain, you know.

47:59.458 --> 48:02.596
Yeah, any chance you could
drive us to the airport?

48:03.563 --> 48:06.097
Oh, well I mean I would

48:06.099 --> 48:07.898
but the roads are washed out.

48:07.900 --> 48:10.537
But they should be
clear by daybreak.

48:10.869 --> 48:12.404
Morning daybreak?

48:13.338 --> 48:16.407
Yeah, happens every
October through March.

48:16.409 --> 48:17.844
Nature's curfew.

48:19.478 --> 48:20.846
That's really cute.

48:21.748 --> 48:25.215
If the lights blow, we keep
candles and a kerosene lamp

48:25.217 --> 48:27.219
or two in the back
of the basement.

48:28.353 --> 48:30.756
May as well just
shelter from the storm.

48:40.867 --> 48:43.233
Maybe we should pack
it in, try to sleep.

48:43.235 --> 48:45.436
I'm too wired to sleep.

48:45.438 --> 48:46.806
I'm probably too sober.

48:48.106 --> 48:49.440
What is the deal
with this thing?

48:49.442 --> 48:50.974
Does the garbage
disposal even work?

48:50.976 --> 48:53.311
Maybe Amber's right, this
is kind of fucked up.

48:53.313 --> 48:54.711
Oh please, she's a ding dong.

48:54.713 --> 48:57.615
Hey Paul, this thing
is totally clogged.

48:57.617 --> 48:59.249
Maybe the pump is broken.

48:59.251 --> 49:00.316
She's not a...

49:00.318 --> 49:02.586
I mean she's young and hot.

49:02.588 --> 49:05.121
Hey Paul, can you
please check the well?

49:05.123 --> 49:06.324
She's not an idiot.

49:06.326 --> 49:07.791
Nice of you to defend her.

49:07.793 --> 49:09.325
Well, because she
doesn't even want a beer,

49:09.327 --> 49:10.595
give her a break.

49:10.597 --> 49:11.829
Please.

49:15.201 --> 49:16.369
Uh, Sylvia?

49:18.538 --> 49:20.670
Oh, good, it's you.

49:20.672 --> 49:22.274
Could you give me a hand, Paul?

49:22.507 --> 49:25.041
Oh, I was just coming
down to check the well.

49:25.043 --> 49:27.010
The sink's all backed up.

49:27.012 --> 49:28.545
Oh, sorry about that.

49:28.547 --> 49:31.450
There really is no good
way to dispose of these.

49:34.621 --> 49:36.052
<i>What do you care?</i>

49:36.054 --> 49:37.354
It's not like you're
gonna remember anyway.

49:37.356 --> 49:38.356
You'll be blacked out by nine.

49:38.358 --> 49:39.824
What the fuck?

49:39.826 --> 49:42.025
I mean, two baby
showers, Elaine?

49:42.027 --> 49:43.126
Oh my god.

49:43.128 --> 49:44.293
And you didn't come to Jojo's,

49:44.295 --> 49:45.229
you didn't come to Sally's.

49:45.231 --> 49:46.264
She's your step-kid.

49:46.266 --> 49:47.898
She was four years old!

49:47.900 --> 49:50.635
She was two and a half and
she was still my first baby!

49:50.637 --> 49:52.101
Seriously, who doesn't
visit their best friend

49:52.103 --> 49:54.572
just because they live
a fucking bus ride away?

49:54.574 --> 49:56.907
It's Connecticut,
Bess, not a bus ride.

49:56.909 --> 49:59.010
It's called the
Metro North, Elaine,

49:59.012 --> 50:00.811
and it takes about
an hour and a half!

50:00.813 --> 50:02.479
You're right, I'm so sorry!

50:02.481 --> 50:03.880
Between paying two rents,
changing adult diapers

50:03.882 --> 50:05.682
and keeping my mom from
falling down the stairs,

50:05.684 --> 50:08.284
I definitely had time for
a joyride to the suburbs!

50:08.286 --> 50:09.519
We would have come in, okay?

50:09.521 --> 50:10.887
We could have come
to the funeral,

50:10.889 --> 50:12.722
taken you out to lunch,
taken you to the park.

50:12.724 --> 50:14.391
Oh because going to
a fucking petting zoo

50:14.393 --> 50:16.659
with your perfect family is
exactly how I want to spend

50:16.661 --> 50:18.195
my first days as an orphan!

50:18.197 --> 50:19.563
You made a choice!

50:19.565 --> 50:20.965
You were all about work.

50:20.967 --> 50:22.465
You never once talked
about having kids!

50:22.467 --> 50:24.168
Oh how could I?

50:24.170 --> 50:26.737
You never for a second stopped
fucking talking about yours!

50:45.257 --> 50:46.692
Everyone okay?

50:49.094 --> 50:50.963
I think we unclogged the sink.

50:52.632 --> 50:54.900
Oh, come on, dudes!

50:55.134 --> 50:56.369
Fuck.

50:56.635 --> 50:57.936
I'm gonna change.

51:03.541 --> 51:04.744
Of course it doesn't.

51:06.545 --> 51:07.613
Come on.

51:15.887 --> 51:16.755
Oh gosh.

51:17.724 --> 51:19.525
I should be listening
to my uh oh feelings.

51:19.724 --> 51:21.258
Ah, smells like shit down here.

51:21.260 --> 51:22.726
That's what I tell the kids.

51:22.728 --> 51:24.662
Listen to their uh oh feelings.

51:24.664 --> 51:25.595
What are they, five?

51:25.597 --> 51:26.699
They're fucking idiots.

51:27.266 --> 51:28.565
I don't see any lamps.

51:28.567 --> 51:30.570
Okay, hold up, would you please?

51:32.070 --> 51:34.406
She said back of
the basement, ah.

51:35.106 --> 51:36.342
Back of the basement.

51:37.175 --> 51:38.641
Come on, Larry.

51:38.643 --> 51:40.209
I'm sure it's in here.

51:40.211 --> 51:41.112
Yeah.

51:44.617 --> 51:47.387
Yeah, maybe some old
Playboys back here.

51:50.755 --> 51:52.057
Blow up sex doll.

51:54.092 --> 51:55.027
That'd be fun, huh?

51:56.295 --> 51:57.762
Okay, wait.

51:57.764 --> 52:00.396
Is this it, this is
one of those, um...

52:00.398 --> 52:01.831
Oh yeah, that's, let me see.

52:01.833 --> 52:02.867
- Camping lamps, right?
- Yup.

52:02.869 --> 52:04.767
I think you just...

52:04.769 --> 52:06.706
I think you just...

52:09.842 --> 52:11.575
- Yup.
- Ah, cool.

52:11.577 --> 52:12.445
Boom.

52:12.711 --> 52:14.345
We have light.

52:14.347 --> 52:16.313
Oh, it smells like a
damn public bathroom, man.

52:16.315 --> 52:17.682
It was like a stack.

52:17.684 --> 52:19.282
It was like a stack
of animals, dude.

52:19.284 --> 52:20.383
And Sylvia was just...

52:20.385 --> 52:21.318
Dude, I don't wanna know, man.

52:21.320 --> 52:22.552
I'm sorry, I can't.

52:22.554 --> 52:24.153
I just, I don't
have my pipe here

52:24.155 --> 52:24.990
and I just...

52:25.958 --> 52:27.858
I'm not high enough
to hear this shit.

52:27.860 --> 52:29.994
And you definitely can't
be telling the girls.

52:29.996 --> 52:32.097
We cannot take any
more crazy right now.

52:32.530 --> 52:34.697
Fine, can you just hand
me the tarps please?

52:34.699 --> 52:36.133
You know, you're nuts, man.

52:36.135 --> 52:37.400
The last thing we
should be doing

52:37.402 --> 52:38.702
is Sylvia's damn housework.

52:38.704 --> 52:40.003
Right, whatever, come on.

52:40.005 --> 52:41.838
You know, that's
why she asked you.

52:41.840 --> 52:44.576
She knew that you would be
the only sucker to say yes.

52:46.244 --> 52:47.112
Bye.

52:48.213 --> 52:49.615
Look at that.

52:53.652 --> 52:54.617
Is it on?

52:54.619 --> 52:56.653
Yeah, say cheese.

52:56.655 --> 52:58.958
Maybe Sylvia's working
on a rat documentary.

52:59.257 --> 53:00.324
Wanna say a few words?

53:00.326 --> 53:01.691
Turn it off, it's super creepy.

53:01.693 --> 53:03.427
You look really
hot in this light.

53:03.429 --> 53:04.795
Shut up.

53:04.797 --> 53:07.396
Maybe Max has a science
blog, LonelyMax15.

53:07.398 --> 53:08.800
Right, Max on the internet.

53:08.802 --> 53:11.300
He wouldn't even be
in photographs.

53:11.302 --> 53:12.269
Okay, let's see.

53:12.271 --> 53:13.336
Let's see what's on it.

53:13.338 --> 53:14.871
No, Larry, stop, okay,

53:14.873 --> 53:16.206
what if he's masturbating
or something?

53:16.208 --> 53:17.441
I don't want that
image in my head.

53:17.443 --> 53:18.608
Dead guy jacking off?

53:18.610 --> 53:19.679
Larry.

53:21.681 --> 53:24.847
And, ah, not naked.

53:24.849 --> 53:26.983
Needs a shower maybe but...

53:26.985 --> 53:27.885
Oh, Max.

53:27.887 --> 53:29.121
<i>Yeah, uh.</i>

53:30.121 --> 53:32.121
<i>Those were some
really great years.</i>

53:32.123 --> 53:37.996
<i>You know, you guys, you were
the McHale Hall Crew, and...</i>

53:40.599 --> 53:42.534
<i>...my best friends, so.</i>

53:51.344 --> 53:54.213
I know I'll see you
on the other side, so...

53:57.483 --> 53:58.914
Forgive me.

54:02.420 --> 54:03.855
What the fuck?

54:04.289 --> 54:05.657
Oh Jesus.

54:06.291 --> 54:07.691
Why did you show me that?

54:07.693 --> 54:10.594
Why the fuck did we
watch that, you asshole!

54:10.596 --> 54:11.762
I didn't know.

54:11.764 --> 54:12.795
I didn't know!

54:12.797 --> 54:14.197
How was I supposed to know

54:14.199 --> 54:15.331
that he was gonna off
himself on camera?

54:15.333 --> 54:16.233
She didn't tell us.

54:16.235 --> 54:17.300
She did, remember?

54:17.302 --> 54:18.834
She said he asked for us.

54:18.836 --> 54:20.371
Not before he offed himself,
she didn't say that!

54:20.373 --> 54:21.637
Well, she didn't have to,

54:21.639 --> 54:23.005
we got to see for ourselves.

54:23.007 --> 54:24.608
Why didn't he say anything?

54:24.610 --> 54:27.276
I mean who did he have, Sylvia?

54:27.278 --> 54:28.278
He had us.

54:28.280 --> 54:30.014
Yeah, right.

54:30.016 --> 54:31.282
He should
have told somebody.

54:31.284 --> 54:32.182
Who?

54:32.184 --> 54:33.251
He's a therapist.

54:33.253 --> 54:34.687
Another fucking
therapist, I don't know.

54:35.387 --> 54:37.686
Fuck, Larry, we
shouldn't have seen that.

54:37.688 --> 54:39.021
It was private.

54:39.023 --> 54:41.358
Please, she didn't
take the tape out.

54:41.360 --> 54:42.562
The camera was on.

54:42.762 --> 54:43.793
Well maybe it was a
shrine or something

54:43.795 --> 54:45.362
too painful to deal with.

54:45.364 --> 54:47.197
So she sends us down
here to get candles

54:47.199 --> 54:48.300
and kerosene lamps?

54:56.074 --> 54:57.273
Oh shit.

54:57.275 --> 55:00.547
Um... uh dude?

55:03.483 --> 55:04.481
I think there's something in...

55:05.717 --> 55:06.615
Ah shit!
No, fuck, get off!

55:06.617 --> 55:07.650
Get the fuck off!

55:07.652 --> 55:08.686
Yo!

55:08.688 --> 55:10.088
Goddamn shit!

55:11.289 --> 55:12.354
The fuck?

55:12.356 --> 55:13.226
Dude?

55:14.226 --> 55:15.358
You all right, man?

55:15.360 --> 55:17.764
No, I'm, I'm fine.

55:18.496 --> 55:20.329
I'm fine.

55:20.331 --> 55:21.166
I'm fine.

55:23.536 --> 55:24.604
Oh shit.

55:29.507 --> 55:30.576
Oh shit.

55:42.554 --> 55:43.623
He reloaded?

55:47.659 --> 55:49.525
Is that Sylvia?

55:49.527 --> 55:50.862
Yeah.

55:51.764 --> 55:53.733
Not exactly sheltering
from the storm.

56:10.516 --> 56:11.384
What was that?

56:16.887 --> 56:17.787
Oh Jesus.

56:17.789 --> 56:18.891
Oh my god.

56:31.603 --> 56:32.702
Fuck!

56:32.704 --> 56:33.903
What, what, come on, come on!

56:33.905 --> 56:35.005
It won't budge!

56:35.007 --> 56:36.940
I can't do it, it's just locked.

56:36.942 --> 56:38.842
- Guys!
- Guys!

56:38.844 --> 56:39.912
Hey guys!

56:49.021 --> 56:51.021
You are a saint, dude.

56:51.023 --> 56:53.259
Not enough people like
you in this world.

56:54.693 --> 56:55.925
Thanks, man, thanks.

56:55.927 --> 56:58.161
Oh shit
man, what happened?

56:58.163 --> 57:00.831
- Oh, there's this...
- You gotta wrap that, man,

57:00.833 --> 57:02.465
that is nasty.

57:02.467 --> 57:03.934
Thanks man, I'll do that.

57:03.936 --> 57:05.903
Hey, so what'd you find?

57:05.905 --> 57:07.037
Any cash?

57:07.039 --> 57:09.809
Oh no, it's just
a bunch of junk.

57:10.643 --> 57:12.008
Total hoarders huh?

57:12.010 --> 57:14.411
Yeah, yeah some
people don't know

57:14.413 --> 57:15.780
when to let things go.

57:15.782 --> 57:17.581
- Hey guys!
- Guys!

57:17.583 --> 57:20.353
Where the fuck did everybody go?

57:22.621 --> 57:23.619
Fuck, I can't get through that.

57:23.621 --> 57:24.753
Wait.

57:24.755 --> 57:26.090
Do you hear that?

57:28.226 --> 57:29.626
Hey!

57:29.628 --> 57:30.894
Yo guys!

57:30.896 --> 57:32.295
Who is that?

57:32.297 --> 57:33.697
Fuck if I know.

57:33.699 --> 57:35.065
Maybe Jack and Gandhi are
done underneath the house.

57:35.067 --> 57:36.132
It doesn't sound like Jack.

57:36.134 --> 57:38.668
Yeah, sure shit ain't Paul.

57:41.239 --> 57:42.107
Holy shit!

57:44.041 --> 57:45.842
Open the fucking door!

57:45.844 --> 57:47.112
Help guys!

57:48.280 --> 57:49.748
Hey, hey, hey!

57:50.949 --> 57:52.216
Fuck, fuck, come on!

57:52.518 --> 57:53.918
Fuck!

57:54.186 --> 57:55.920
What the hell, dudes,
what are you doing?

57:55.922 --> 57:56.987
Going to second fucking base,

57:56.989 --> 57:57.920
what do you think we're doing?!

57:57.922 --> 57:58.921
Well what happened?

57:58.923 --> 57:59.889
It's Max.

57:59.891 --> 58:01.391
What?

58:01.393 --> 58:02.161
Max?

58:04.663 --> 58:05.998
He's fucking back.

58:10.135 --> 58:12.369
What you said was that
you saw Max shoot himself.

58:12.371 --> 58:13.570
We did.

58:13.572 --> 58:15.274
Well who the hell is
gonna kill a guy twice?

58:15.474 --> 58:17.541
Fuck me, come on!

58:17.543 --> 58:19.376
He was right there, I swear.

58:19.378 --> 58:20.276
Told you.

58:20.278 --> 58:21.845
There was fighting, okay?

58:21.847 --> 58:23.447
Someone was fighting,
we heard a thump

58:23.449 --> 58:26.450
and then suddenly his dead
ass body is on the ground

58:26.452 --> 58:28.017
staring back at us.

58:28.019 --> 58:29.952
The same dead ass body
we buried this afternoon?

58:29.954 --> 58:31.220
I don't know.

58:31.222 --> 58:32.557
Okay, so
where's the body?

58:33.025 --> 58:34.090
I mean did he walk away?

58:34.092 --> 58:35.958
I don't see drag marks.

58:35.960 --> 58:37.094
Well, it's been raining.

58:37.096 --> 58:38.494
What are you, CSI guy now?

58:38.496 --> 58:40.331
Wanna test for
fucking coat fibers?

58:40.333 --> 58:41.965
What happened
to your arm?

58:41.967 --> 58:43.499
All I'm saying is that
if there was a body

58:43.501 --> 58:45.034
it would be here.

58:45.036 --> 58:46.536
Well so maybe that freaky
kid dug up Max's body

58:46.538 --> 58:48.704
and he's running
around scaring the shit

58:48.706 --> 58:49.572
out of people with it.

58:49.574 --> 58:50.441
Jack?

58:50.443 --> 58:51.608
Hold on, babe.

58:51.610 --> 58:53.177
I don't
know, it's Wisconsin.

58:53.179 --> 58:54.577
What do people do
for fun around here?

58:54.579 --> 58:55.744
So an 18 year
old's gonna drag around

58:55.746 --> 58:56.646
a 200 pound dead man?

58:56.648 --> 58:58.081
Maybe he had help.

58:58.083 --> 58:59.715
Who would do
that, another student,

58:59.717 --> 59:01.084
a member of the faculty?

59:01.086 --> 59:02.318
Maybe.

59:02.320 --> 59:03.052
Why?

59:03.054 --> 59:04.119
Jack, what is that?

59:04.121 --> 59:05.521
Just a second, babe.

59:05.523 --> 59:07.257
I don't know
dude, I don't know why.

59:07.259 --> 59:08.525
Max wasn't exactly the
easiest to get along with.

59:08.527 --> 59:10.360
But he's
not a monster, man.

59:10.362 --> 59:12.597
I mean you wouldn't dig him
out of the ground over it.

59:14.532 --> 59:15.432
To someone out there,
death was not punishment enough.

59:15.434 --> 59:15.932
Jack!

59:15.934 --> 59:16.700
What?

59:20.472 --> 59:21.307
Shit!

59:29.148 --> 59:31.416
Oh... oh shit.

59:32.684 --> 59:33.583
Oh god.

59:33.585 --> 59:34.684
Jack!

59:34.686 --> 59:35.954
Are you all right, man?

59:36.621 --> 59:37.688
What the fuck was that, man?

59:37.690 --> 59:38.755
What the fuck was that?

59:38.757 --> 59:40.023
Oh my god, it's a trap,

59:40.025 --> 59:41.057
a fucking animal trap.

59:41.059 --> 59:42.159
Look at that shit!

59:42.161 --> 59:43.693
It's gotta be like a trip line

59:43.695 --> 59:44.894
right, for the dogs, to
keep them off the property!

59:46.965 --> 59:48.300
What was that?

59:49.034 --> 59:50.400
We've gotta get out of here.

59:50.402 --> 59:51.668
No, we have to take
him to a hospital

59:51.670 --> 59:53.170
'cause he doesn't look good.

59:53.172 --> 59:54.637
We're gonna have to ask
Sylvia to borrow her car.

59:54.639 --> 59:56.305
No, fuck that,
we're gonna take it.

59:56.307 --> 59:58.074
I'm not stealing a car, Larry!

59:58.076 --> 59:59.342
You know what, you stay here

59:59.344 --> 01:00:00.844
and console the fucking widow.

01:00:00.846 --> 01:00:02.479
And tell him how bummed you are

01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:04.847
that her husband keeps
showing up covered in blood.

01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:05.883
But I am done here!

01:00:05.885 --> 01:00:07.184
We have to tell Sylvia.

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:09.086
I mean it's gotta be a prank!

01:00:09.088 --> 01:00:10.186
Oh because this is
really, really funny.

01:00:10.188 --> 01:00:11.755
And even if it's not,

01:00:11.757 --> 01:00:13.222
I mean if somebody is
desecrating her husband's grave

01:00:13.224 --> 01:00:15.559
she has a right to know!

01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:17.293
Okay fine, you
want to tell Sylvia

01:00:17.295 --> 01:00:19.331
someone dug up her husband,
now's you're chance.

01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:22.197
Good luck with that, dude.

01:00:22.199 --> 01:00:23.368
Oh that's typical.

01:00:24.804 --> 01:00:25.872
What was that?

01:00:27.204 --> 01:00:28.438
You, sticking your neck out,

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.173
it's not really
your thing, is it?

01:00:30.175 --> 01:00:31.974
What the hell, man,

01:00:31.976 --> 01:00:33.209
now you're gonna ball up?

01:00:33.211 --> 01:00:35.110
It's cool, I'll go.

01:00:35.112 --> 01:00:37.613
No, no, no, fuck that, I'll go.

01:00:37.615 --> 01:00:38.882
Yeah, up to you.

01:00:38.884 --> 01:00:40.550
Let's go!

01:00:40.552 --> 01:00:42.753
You picked the fucking hell
of a time to ball up, dude.

01:00:42.755 --> 01:00:44.320
I'm taking her car.

01:00:44.322 --> 01:00:45.255
I'll come too.

01:00:45.257 --> 01:00:46.423
- What?
- What?

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:47.657
Or I could stay here, you know

01:00:47.659 --> 01:00:48.525
if Amber needs me.

01:00:48.527 --> 01:00:49.295
Bess can stay!

01:00:51.096 --> 01:00:52.565
I'll be back in a sec, babe.

01:00:55.067 --> 01:00:56.967
If you leave without
me, I will find you,

01:00:56.969 --> 01:00:58.367
set fire to your apartment

01:00:58.369 --> 01:01:00.705
and tell your girlfriend
we fucked in the shower.

01:01:00.972 --> 01:01:02.905
You must be an amazing mother.

01:01:02.907 --> 01:01:04.441
I'm serious, Jack.

01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:06.646
Don't you fucking start
that engine without me.

01:01:26.664 --> 01:01:28.231
What are you gonna
do with a knife,

01:01:28.233 --> 01:01:29.768
the guy's already dead!

01:01:30.001 --> 01:01:32.267
You're right, you're
totally right.

01:01:32.269 --> 01:01:33.405
I need a shotgun.

01:01:33.639 --> 01:01:35.338
Can you fire a shotgun?

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.275
No, okay, but like
an ax or something.

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:39.577
But we like to have
decapitate him.

01:01:39.878 --> 01:01:41.146
Okay, you watch a lot of TV.

01:01:41.545 --> 01:01:43.612
Sorry, I don't want
my brains eaten.

01:01:43.614 --> 01:01:45.782
Look, look, there's that
wack job student of Max

01:01:45.784 --> 01:01:47.483
who's just pissed off
decides to freak out his wife

01:01:47.485 --> 01:01:48.885
to fuck up his
body, I don't know,

01:01:48.887 --> 01:01:49.885
people are sick.

01:01:49.887 --> 01:01:51.320
Knives, knives.

01:01:51.322 --> 01:01:53.155
Will you stop it, you
don't need a knife!

01:01:53.157 --> 01:01:54.557
How do you know?

01:01:54.559 --> 01:01:56.258
How do you know that
he's not gonna come back

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.695
with a dead guy, with a
whole bunch of dead guys?

01:01:59.697 --> 01:02:01.398
Amber, stop it!

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.034
It's about to be the zombie
freaking apocalypse in here!

01:02:05.036 --> 01:02:07.503
Amber, stop!

01:02:07.505 --> 01:02:10.173
- Mrs. Lehman?
- Norma?

01:02:10.175 --> 01:02:11.577
- Louder.
- Norma?

01:02:12.543 --> 01:02:15.013
Sorry to bother
you, Mrs. Lehman.

01:02:22.755 --> 01:02:24.720
Oh my god, wait, a camera.

01:02:24.722 --> 01:02:26.992
This place is a dump,
there's nothing to steal.

01:02:27.793 --> 01:02:29.528
They're not watching the house.

01:02:30.262 --> 01:02:31.430
They're watching us.

01:02:35.467 --> 01:02:39.668
Norma, it's Jack and
Elaine, Max's friends.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:40.938
Can we come in?

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:44.441
We're looking for car
keys, to Sylvia's car.

01:02:44.443 --> 01:02:45.678
Do you mind if we...

01:02:46.612 --> 01:02:48.043
Oh.

01:02:48.045 --> 01:02:50.613
Norma, sorry to wake you.

01:02:50.615 --> 01:02:53.052
Do you have the keys
to Sylvia's car?

01:02:54.485 --> 01:02:56.254
Oh no, no, don't get up, we can.

01:02:58.389 --> 01:03:00.224
Oh shit, holy shit.

01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:02.891
What the fuck, is she dead?

01:03:02.893 --> 01:03:03.695
Norma?

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:09.601
Norma?

01:03:13.838 --> 01:03:15.206
Oh fuck, what the fuck?

01:03:15.507 --> 01:03:16.639
Out, out!

01:03:16.641 --> 01:03:19.177
Out out out now,
get out now, now!

01:03:27.753 --> 01:03:29.221
I found another one.

01:03:37.929 --> 01:03:38.798
Fuck.

01:03:48.005 --> 01:03:49.104
Found one.

01:03:49.106 --> 01:03:51.141
Over the sink, sick fucks.

01:03:51.143 --> 01:03:53.342
Points directly at the toilet.

01:03:53.344 --> 01:03:54.476
Hah, they asked for it.

01:03:54.478 --> 01:03:56.112
You put a camera
in the bathroom,

01:03:56.114 --> 01:03:57.583
you're gonna see some shit.

01:04:09.661 --> 01:04:10.459
Oh, come on!

01:04:10.461 --> 01:04:11.797
- Hey!
- Open up!

01:04:15.266 --> 01:04:16.801
What the hell, dude?

01:04:24.909 --> 01:04:26.278
Hello?

01:04:32.217 --> 01:04:34.420
Are you watching or playing?

01:04:35.721 --> 01:04:37.655
'Cause either way,
you're paying.

01:05:03.514 --> 01:05:05.850
Hello, anybody home?

01:05:13.425 --> 01:05:15.494
You don't seem
particularly concerned.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.764
Norma's been going downhill
for a very long time now.

01:05:20.766 --> 01:05:23.465
Well, there's nothing I can do
until the phone lines are up.

01:05:23.467 --> 01:05:25.334
What about the rat massacre?

01:05:25.336 --> 01:05:27.369
It's hardly a massacre.

01:05:27.371 --> 01:05:29.741
Maisy used to
kill one rat a day.

01:05:31.041 --> 01:05:34.075
Well, it's not my job to
monitor my husband's work,

01:05:34.077 --> 01:05:35.512
strange as it is.

01:05:35.514 --> 01:05:37.046
Then what's with
all the cameras?

01:05:37.048 --> 01:05:38.780
Oh, Max got nervous.

01:05:38.782 --> 01:05:41.383
He received a bunch
of phone calls

01:05:41.385 --> 01:05:43.552
and threatening emails.

01:05:43.554 --> 01:05:45.487
This place is wired like
the fucking White House.

01:05:45.489 --> 01:05:47.490
He was afraid he
was being targeted.

01:05:47.492 --> 01:05:49.094
By scientists?

01:05:49.393 --> 01:05:52.061
I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

01:05:52.063 --> 01:05:53.731
Where are Paul and Larry?

01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:56.099
They're not with you?

01:05:56.101 --> 01:05:57.403
Where's Max?

01:05:58.369 --> 01:06:00.135
Max is dead, Jack.

01:06:00.137 --> 01:06:01.406
You sure about that?

01:06:03.108 --> 01:06:04.777
I don't have to listen to this.

01:06:06.677 --> 01:06:07.778
You do, if you ever wanna see

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.244
your creepy ass footage again.

01:06:09.246 --> 01:06:10.214
Amber?

01:06:10.414 --> 01:06:11.617
I got 'em.

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:14.950
Good, so you tell us
where Paul and Larry are,

01:06:14.952 --> 01:06:17.586
why Max's corpse
keeps showing up,

01:06:17.588 --> 01:06:21.557
or Amber burns every
memory card in this house.

01:06:21.559 --> 01:06:23.760
Oh, it's Max's project.

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:25.896
I don't particularly care.

01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:27.630
Although I'm sure it's
exactly what he would

01:06:27.632 --> 01:06:29.434
have expected of you.

01:06:29.668 --> 01:06:31.501
Not me, he didn't know me.

01:06:31.503 --> 01:06:34.506
Well he didn't need to,
you're kind of obvious.

01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:40.578
You see, human nature
never disappoints.

01:06:43.282 --> 01:06:45.017
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:48.117
Follow me.

01:06:48.119 --> 01:06:49.019
No, no, no, no.

01:06:50.054 --> 01:06:51.487
Well I can't really
explain it to you.

01:06:51.489 --> 01:06:52.889
I wouldn't do it justice.

01:06:52.891 --> 01:06:53.755
Try.

01:06:53.757 --> 01:06:56.261
But I know just the one who can.

01:06:57.494 --> 01:06:59.597
If we're not back in
15 minutes, burn them.

01:07:24.322 --> 01:07:26.055
Oh my god, Larry?

01:07:26.057 --> 01:07:27.123
What the hell, Max?

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:28.659
Please, please don't touch them.

01:07:28.927 --> 01:07:32.262
These are consenting
adults, albeit implied.

01:07:32.264 --> 01:07:33.563
Jesus, what the hell?

01:07:33.565 --> 01:07:34.532
I said don't touch them!

01:07:35.699 --> 01:07:36.932
Whoah, I don't believe this.

01:07:36.934 --> 01:07:39.336
Sylvia, Sylvia,
put down the gun.

01:07:39.771 --> 01:07:42.539
I'm sorry, that
doesn't feel right.

01:07:43.273 --> 01:07:45.007
Now Max would explain everything

01:07:45.009 --> 01:07:49.244
but our creative differences
have rendered him speechless.

01:07:49.246 --> 01:07:50.412
So, I will.

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:51.981
Oh Sylvia, please, can we just...

01:07:51.983 --> 01:07:52.951
Back the fuck up!

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.588
Back the fuck up.

01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:00.555
Now if he could
speak, Max would say

01:08:00.557 --> 01:08:01.925
he had no choice.

01:08:01.927 --> 01:08:04.427
An unfinished study
is a worthless one

01:08:04.429 --> 01:08:08.565
and I promised him that we
would finish it together.

01:08:08.567 --> 01:08:10.900
But I'm all about the art.

01:08:10.902 --> 01:08:13.536
And he's all about the science

01:08:13.538 --> 01:08:16.005
which does get annoying.

01:08:16.006 --> 01:08:17.406
Sylvia, come on.

01:08:17.408 --> 01:08:18.607
It's a damn college study!

01:08:22.145 --> 01:08:23.145
What the fuck?!

01:08:23.148 --> 01:08:24.515
Shit, Sylvia!

01:08:26.216 --> 01:08:30.822
So uh, we've had to give
each other a little space.

01:08:31.555 --> 01:08:33.024
Healthy in any marriage.

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:36.362
Shut up, Max.

01:08:37.895 --> 01:08:38.764
Hey.

01:08:43.469 --> 01:08:47.072
Did you guys know
that in World War II

01:08:47.971 --> 01:08:51.840
only 25 percent of soldiers
actually fired their weapons

01:08:51.841 --> 01:08:54.678
at an exposed enemy soldier?

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.746
Our mammalian brains,
our dog brains

01:08:57.747 --> 01:08:59.281
kept getting in the way.

01:08:59.283 --> 01:09:01.616
Reluctance to kill one
of our own species,

01:09:01.618 --> 01:09:03.586
can you believe that?

01:09:03.587 --> 01:09:05.724
What a waste of
government spending.

01:09:05.957 --> 01:09:07.189
I'm very uncomfortable
right now.

01:09:07.192 --> 01:09:08.691
-Quiet!

01:09:08.693 --> 01:09:12.828
Stimulate that amygdala
enough, that fear center,

01:09:12.831 --> 01:09:16.765
follow it up with a little
loathing, make it personal,

01:09:16.768 --> 01:09:19.304
and that little dog
brain just goes to sleep.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:23.106
Just a little nap, just long
enough to pull the trigger

01:09:23.108 --> 01:09:24.473
and then, <i>voila!,</i>

01:09:24.475 --> 01:09:28.345
your ordinary citizen
becomes an instant soldier.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:32.848
As you can see Jack, it's not
just a damn college study.

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:35.751
This is a potentially game
changing tactic of war!

01:09:35.752 --> 01:09:37.452
That's really fucked up.

01:09:37.453 --> 01:09:38.524
Isn't it?

01:09:40.225 --> 01:09:43.158
But no ending, no cash.

01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:46.996
So Max's friends were
the obvious choice.

01:09:46.997 --> 01:09:51.336
The perfect petri dish of
boring middle class America.

01:09:51.636 --> 01:09:54.103
Just give us our
friend and we will go.

01:09:54.104 --> 01:09:54.972
Which friend?

01:09:55.672 --> 01:09:56.974
You can only have one.

01:09:58.042 --> 01:10:00.477
Shut up, Jesus, I cannot think

01:10:00.479 --> 01:10:02.611
with you moaning all the time!

01:10:03.914 --> 01:10:04.981
Hey, hey, hey, what did I say,

01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:06.249
what did I say?

01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:08.250
If it was up to you we
would still be on the web

01:10:08.252 --> 01:10:11.019
searching for fucking zip ties.

01:10:11.021 --> 01:10:12.120
Now shut it!

01:10:12.122 --> 01:10:13.990
Sylvia, you don't
need to do this.

01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:15.858
This is Max's fucked up thing.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.994
I mean you're like the real
deal, you do documentaries.

01:10:17.996 --> 01:10:20.731
No one funds
documentaries anymore.

01:10:21.667 --> 01:10:23.799
Unless they're about
orphans in Sudan

01:10:23.801 --> 01:10:26.103
or fat people in America!

01:10:27.104 --> 01:10:29.472
Max was in on all
of this of course.

01:10:31.443 --> 01:10:34.079
Hey!

01:10:36.046 --> 01:10:36.914
Until now.

01:10:38.884 --> 01:10:42.520
This is where we
part ways, creatively.

01:10:43.354 --> 01:10:44.188
Max?

01:10:45.556 --> 01:10:48.424
And literally too, I suppose.

01:10:48.426 --> 01:10:49.659
Yo, Max, are you...?

01:10:49.661 --> 01:10:51.227
Guess I don't know
my own strength.

01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:53.696
Well, it's time to put
it to some good use.

01:10:53.698 --> 01:10:54.865
Shit, man!

01:10:55.832 --> 01:10:58.401
Ooh, I might have to
make that hole bigger.

01:10:58.403 --> 01:10:59.771
Oh come on, Sylvia.

01:11:00.706 --> 01:11:02.772
If you kill us,
your project's dead.

01:11:02.774 --> 01:11:05.040
You're just part of the story.

01:11:05.042 --> 01:11:07.311
You're ultimately dispensable.

01:11:07.712 --> 01:11:09.144
No, no, no, if we're not back,

01:11:09.146 --> 01:11:11.112
Bess and Amber are gonna
burn all the footage.

01:11:11.114 --> 01:11:13.316
You really think
they'll still be there?

01:11:13.318 --> 01:11:14.186
Yeah I do.

01:11:16.054 --> 01:11:16.922
You would.

01:11:17.921 --> 01:11:20.255
You are relentlessly optimistic

01:11:20.257 --> 01:11:24.461
for someone with such
a sad little life.

01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:26.329
Oh no.

01:11:26.331 --> 01:11:28.199
Oh I didn't say that,
he did.

01:11:30.702 --> 01:11:32.671
Now's your chance
to get him back.

01:11:35.239 --> 01:11:36.104
Get up!

01:11:36.106 --> 01:11:38.741
- Oh shit!
- Hey, hey!

01:11:38.743 --> 01:11:40.812
Get the fuck up before I
kill off your character!

01:11:45.582 --> 01:11:47.552
Still gotta have an ending.

01:12:06.171 --> 01:12:08.707
So, here's the deal.

01:12:10.442 --> 01:12:14.943
One of you could run and
have a 10 percent chance

01:12:14.945 --> 01:12:16.413
of making it out that door.

01:12:17.414 --> 01:12:20.083
If all of you run
at the same time,

01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:22.919
your odds go up to
40, maybe 50 percent

01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:26.121
but the odds that I
shoot your pal Larry here

01:12:26.123 --> 01:12:28.827
at close range are 100 percent.

01:12:29.793 --> 01:12:32.728
So you might live
but your friend

01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:34.666
will most certainly
die, up to you.

01:12:44.108 --> 01:12:46.744
Oh, well, you're
eyeing the exit.

01:12:47.712 --> 01:12:49.014
And who can blame you?

01:12:50.981 --> 01:12:52.680
No sense in risking your life

01:12:52.682 --> 01:12:57.288
for someone who wouldn't even
hail you a cab in the rain.

01:12:59.524 --> 01:13:00.859
You're crazy.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.960
Well, look around you.

01:13:04.962 --> 01:13:06.765
It's all relative.

01:13:08.733 --> 01:13:10.268
You're on the fence.

01:13:11.301 --> 01:13:13.102
Oh, I can tell.

01:13:13.104 --> 01:13:16.671
He's a dick of a friend, but,

01:13:16.673 --> 01:13:20.375
you're really in no condition
to make any new ones.

01:13:20.377 --> 01:13:23.745
Huh, I'd say misery
loves company

01:13:23.747 --> 01:13:26.348
but you see your sad little life

01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:29.218
is the only thing keeping
his sad little life

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.790
from seeming
comparatively less sad.

01:13:36.327 --> 01:13:39.861
You really wanna sacrifice
yourself to someone

01:13:39.863 --> 01:13:41.130
who's sitting here thinking

01:13:41.132 --> 01:13:42.800
at least I'm not you.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.867
That's nice Larry,
that's really nice.

01:13:47.305 --> 01:13:48.807
But not you, Jack.

01:13:49.506 --> 01:13:50.873
You never liked Larry.

01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:52.541
He never let you forget

01:13:52.543 --> 01:13:55.143
that he was a lawyer, and you
were selling phone bundles

01:13:55.145 --> 01:13:56.880
to housewives in the valley.

01:13:57.849 --> 01:13:59.883
You make in a week what
he makes in an hour,

01:13:59.885 --> 01:14:01.450
I mean that has gotta be hard.

01:14:01.452 --> 01:14:05.053
Guys like Larry are what's
wrong with this world,

01:14:05.055 --> 01:14:07.690
taking your jobs,
your girlfriends,

01:14:07.692 --> 01:14:10.025
maybe it's time
to take them back!

01:14:12.896 --> 01:14:14.296
Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:14.298 --> 01:14:16.400
It is not your turn to speak.

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:26.744
Well, I mean, come on.

01:14:31.047 --> 01:14:35.086
I think we all knew that
Connecticut thing wouldn't last.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.122
You're hanging on
by a small thread

01:14:40.291 --> 01:14:44.760
just calculating, how much
more therapy you'll need

01:14:44.762 --> 01:14:47.263
to get over the latest trauma

01:14:47.265 --> 01:14:48.865
and how much guilt
you should feel

01:14:48.867 --> 01:14:50.933
for refusing to fuck
Larry in the kitchen

01:14:50.935 --> 01:14:53.802
last night for old time's sake.

01:14:53.804 --> 01:14:54.702
Jesus, Bess.

01:14:54.704 --> 01:14:56.004
What do you care?

01:14:56.006 --> 01:14:57.673
She has a point.

01:14:57.675 --> 01:14:58.877
Yeah.

01:15:01.945 --> 01:15:04.280
I mean we may as
well clear the air

01:15:04.282 --> 01:15:06.284
while we're all
still breathing it.

01:15:24.202 --> 01:15:25.070
So.

01:15:26.671 --> 01:15:31.009
Kill or be killed, my
little lab rodents.

01:15:31.975 --> 01:15:33.010
You choose.

01:16:01.238 --> 01:16:03.540
Fascinating!

01:16:04.676 --> 01:16:07.543
Ah, you think the
outcome would be obvious!

01:16:07.545 --> 01:16:12.382
But the D.O.D. do love to
have the numbers crunched!

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:17.087
Oh, I almost wish Max
was here to see this!

01:16:20.358 --> 01:16:25.529
But my film will finally
show our work, my work,

01:16:26.029 --> 01:16:27.264
to the world!

01:16:28.699 --> 01:16:32.903
All I need now is
the perfect ending.

01:16:40.711 --> 01:16:44.412
And there's nothing
more final than fire.

01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:22.019
All right, all right.

01:17:23.621 --> 01:17:25.021
Paul, Paul.

01:17:25.023 --> 01:17:26.455
Ma'am, you're
gonna have to stay back.

01:17:26.457 --> 01:17:27.589
No, no, no
you don't understand,

01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:28.790
there's been a mistake.

01:17:28.792 --> 01:17:29.892
Ma'am I don't
have to understand,

01:17:29.894 --> 01:17:31.160
that's not my job.

01:17:31.162 --> 01:17:32.628
No, but you can't
just...

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:34.097
Ma'am I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

01:17:34.099 --> 01:17:35.031
He's a therapist,
he's a pacifist!

01:17:35.033 --> 01:17:36.665
With a loaded gun.

01:17:36.667 --> 01:17:38.134
Paul would never
hurt anyone, that's not him.

01:17:38.136 --> 01:17:39.434
It isn't
till it is, ma'am.

01:17:39.436 --> 01:17:41.372
They don't walk
around wearing a sign.

01:17:42.872 --> 01:17:44.740
Ah, it's a shame too.

01:17:44.742 --> 01:17:46.244
She was a real nice lady.

01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:48.477
This is all wrong, okay?

01:17:48.479 --> 01:17:51.446
He's not, he's the
one who's unstable.

01:17:51.448 --> 01:17:53.080
Well I'm not a doctor, ma'am.

01:17:53.082 --> 01:17:54.517
I don't diagnose.

01:17:54.519 --> 01:17:57.152
But you're all
consenting adults.

01:17:57.154 --> 01:17:58.487
And if you don't
want to participate,

01:17:58.489 --> 01:18:00.423
you shouldn't sign the waiver.

01:18:00.425 --> 01:18:01.259
The what?

01:18:09.867 --> 01:18:11.334
Weaponizing fear.

01:18:11.336 --> 01:18:12.968
A comprehensive study
of the effects of fear

01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:15.003
on the human brain.

01:18:15.005 --> 01:18:16.474
Sound familiar?

01:18:17.975 --> 01:18:19.741
These your signature?

01:18:19.743 --> 01:18:21.477
I didn't sign that.

01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:24.548
Ah, at least someone's got
some brains around here.

01:18:25.483 --> 01:18:27.316
The things people do
for money these days.

01:18:27.318 --> 01:18:28.750
Okay folks.

01:18:28.752 --> 01:18:30.956
We'll give you a ride
down to the station.

01:18:32.823 --> 01:18:34.022
Max.

01:18:34.024 --> 01:18:35.458
Hey Max!

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.162
Yeah, what the fuck, man?

01:18:39.096 --> 01:18:40.929
They'll take your
statements in town.

01:18:40.931 --> 01:18:42.196
Let's go.

01:18:42.198 --> 01:18:43.598
No wait, no, no, no, wait wait.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.134
What about that kid,
that student, you know,

01:18:45.136 --> 01:18:46.768
he freaked out, he
disappeared, and...

01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:48.169
Dropped out of college.

01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:49.306
Say it ain't so.

01:18:50.108 --> 01:18:51.339
I mean, but look at him,

01:18:51.341 --> 01:18:52.307
his wife is dead,
he's not even...

01:18:52.309 --> 01:18:53.275
Who, Professor Lehman?

01:18:53.277 --> 01:18:54.677
Ex Professor Lehman.

01:18:54.679 --> 01:18:56.812
No ma'am, he still
works at the university.

01:18:56.814 --> 01:18:59.647
He runs that psychology
department or something.

01:18:59.649 --> 01:19:01.384
And he'll be the first
to tell you...

01:19:01.918 --> 01:19:04.989
Crazy always finds its way out.
