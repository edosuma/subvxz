01:44.617 --> 01:45.851
Come on.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.528
<i>The problem is,
our economy is slowing down.</i>

02:59.596 --> 03:02.132
<i>You all know that
as well as anybody does.</i>

03:02.199 --> 03:04.501
<i>I bet you've got friends
and maybe yourself understand</i>

03:04.568 --> 03:06.669
<i>what it means
to have credit card debt.</i>

03:06.737 --> 03:08.004
<i>When you couple that...</i>

03:09.873 --> 03:12.975
<i>There are some people
beginning to feel pinched.</i>

03:13.043 --> 03:14.944
<i>It makes sense.
To take control...</i>

03:15.012 --> 03:16.479
John?

03:18.282 --> 03:19.649
Honey, what's wrong?

03:21.752 --> 03:24.421
Hey! Hey!

03:24.489 --> 03:26.923
What are you doing?
That's my car.

03:26.991 --> 03:28.626
That's not
what the bank says.

03:28.693 --> 03:30.127
That's my car!
Come on!

03:30.195 --> 03:32.896
Yeah, try paying
your bills.

03:32.964 --> 03:34.365
Hey!

03:55.188 --> 03:56.888
What's going on?

04:04.697 --> 04:08.267
I'm sorry. The bank promised
they'd work with me.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.169
John, that was
two months ago.

04:10.237 --> 04:12.871
I know, but we're down
to one last month's rent.

04:12.939 --> 04:15.541
It's either the car
or the house, so I thought--

04:15.609 --> 04:16.676
you thought.

04:16.743 --> 04:19.178
You want them to throw us
out on the street?

04:19.245 --> 04:21.247
I'm down to 20 hours
at the plant.

04:21.315 --> 04:24.083
They're shipping jobs to Mexico.
What do you want me to do?

04:24.150 --> 04:26.151
John, my car is gone.

04:26.220 --> 04:30.224
I understand. I'm trying
to find a second job, baby.

04:30.291 --> 04:33.727
You want me to say it's fine?
All right, it's fine.

04:35.029 --> 04:38.732
The car is still ours.
I got to wait for my next check.

04:38.799 --> 04:40.567
In two weeks,
we'll be fine.

04:40.635 --> 04:42.402
Mikey!

04:45.072 --> 04:47.841
Yeah! Ronnie Coleman.

04:47.908 --> 04:51.746
Mr. Olympia
two year running.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.681
Yeah!

04:53.749 --> 04:55.483
Sit down, honey.
Eat some breakfast.

04:55.551 --> 04:56.817
I am eating.

04:56.885 --> 04:58.686
A doughnut
isn't breakfast.

04:58.754 --> 04:59.954
It's the continental
breakfast.

05:00.021 --> 05:01.756
We're not on a continent
right now.

05:01.823 --> 05:04.058
Dad, what do you call
North America?

05:04.126 --> 05:06.628
You're not going to school
till you eat, so eat.

05:06.695 --> 05:08.296
Both of you.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.470
I can't believe those jerks
took our car. Can you, mom?

05:14.537 --> 05:15.704
No, I can't.

05:15.772 --> 05:18.340
What are we going to do?

05:18.408 --> 05:20.509
You're going to do something,
right, dad?

05:20.577 --> 05:22.043
You know what I'd do?

05:22.111 --> 05:23.646
I'd get so big and mad,

05:23.713 --> 05:25.648
I'd just go crazy
and kick someone's butt.

05:25.715 --> 05:27.215
Watch your language.
I would.

05:27.284 --> 05:30.185
You been watching too much
of that ww wrestling.

05:30.253 --> 05:32.388
Not wrestling, dad.
Bodybuilding.

05:32.455 --> 05:33.890
There's a big difference.

05:33.957 --> 05:35.992
Get your books.
You're going to be late.

05:36.059 --> 05:38.495
Mike. Pow!

05:38.562 --> 05:39.663
Hurry up, baby.

05:46.504 --> 05:48.305
Can I get a ride
to work?

06:13.131 --> 06:14.965
All right,
I got a good one.

06:21.874 --> 06:23.241
Go ahead. Go ahead.

06:23.309 --> 06:24.743
Radishes.

06:24.811 --> 06:26.678
No, it's....

06:26.746 --> 06:28.547
Reddish stick.

06:28.614 --> 06:30.515
It's "radio station."

06:30.583 --> 06:32.250
Radio station. Okay.

06:32.318 --> 06:35.787
That's a good one.
You got me. Uh...

06:35.855 --> 06:39.425
Uh...

06:41.294 --> 06:42.294
Hon?

06:43.831 --> 06:45.531
Hundred dollars?

06:45.599 --> 06:47.700
No, we talked about it
this morning.

06:49.169 --> 06:50.803
Honinine?

06:50.871 --> 06:52.772
Continent.
Continent.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.607
Got you, right? Mom?

06:54.675 --> 06:55.875
How about you, mom?

06:55.942 --> 06:58.043
No. No.

06:58.111 --> 06:59.980
Come on, baby.
You just laugh.

07:00.047 --> 07:02.449
I don't like it.
I'm no good at it.

07:02.517 --> 07:04.752
All right,
something in the car.

07:04.819 --> 07:06.953
We won't laugh at you.

07:07.021 --> 07:08.389
Please?

07:09.758 --> 07:10.791
All right.

07:10.859 --> 07:12.726
We can't know
what you're saying.

07:12.794 --> 07:15.596
You got to say it
so we don't know.

07:15.663 --> 07:17.130
Dashboard.

07:17.198 --> 07:20.066
What?
What did you say?

07:20.134 --> 07:22.871
I said...

07:22.938 --> 07:25.273
Dashboard. Now.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.975
Ha ha ha ha.

07:28.043 --> 07:29.210
What?

07:32.481 --> 07:34.682
Hello. Come get
this woman, please.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.318
What, it's no good?
Ha ha ha ha.

07:37.386 --> 07:39.353
Come on, come on.

07:39.422 --> 07:42.791
Come on, baby.
I'll thumb-wrestle you.

07:42.858 --> 07:45.260
Ha ha ha. All right.

07:45.328 --> 07:47.229
One, two, three.

07:49.866 --> 07:52.768
One, two, three.
She wins. Ding ding.

07:52.836 --> 07:54.870
I am queen.

07:54.938 --> 07:56.739
All right, I got one.

07:56.807 --> 07:59.107
I got one for you.
You're going to school.

07:59.175 --> 08:00.309
Dad.

08:01.344 --> 08:02.845
Get your lunch.

08:13.458 --> 08:17.828
Hey, dad, I got $46
I saved from my allowance.

08:17.895 --> 08:20.196
You can have it
if you want.

08:20.264 --> 08:23.366
For our family. We got to
stick together, right?

08:23.434 --> 08:27.638
That's right. But you earned
that money, so keep it, okay?

08:27.706 --> 08:29.173
All right.
See you later.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.576
All right.
Bye, Mike.

08:31.643 --> 08:35.513
Not good-bye.
I hate good-bye.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.914
Remember?
"See you later."

08:37.982 --> 08:39.817
All right,
see you later.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.418
Mike!

08:42.587 --> 08:49.461
Flex Wheeler--
275 pounds, 2% body fat.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.096
Yeah!
Yeah!

08:51.163 --> 08:52.598
Yeah, baby.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.642
John! You take
my grinding wheel?

09:34.709 --> 09:35.943
What?

09:36.011 --> 09:37.878
You take
my grinding wheel?

09:37.946 --> 09:39.580
I do, don't I?
You do?

09:39.648 --> 09:41.214
Yeah, I have sex appeal.

09:41.282 --> 09:43.884
No, it's not in my locker--
my grinding wheel.

09:43.952 --> 09:45.419
Do you want mine?

09:45.486 --> 09:48.488
Only two people know
the combination to my locker.

09:48.557 --> 09:51.124
That's my grinder
and you know it.

09:51.192 --> 09:53.293
John! John!
Smoke, all right?

09:53.361 --> 09:54.729
All right.

09:59.201 --> 10:00.735
What's with
the frigging tie?

10:00.803 --> 10:02.403
Somebody die?
You like that?

10:02.471 --> 10:04.439
That's the tie
I'm wearing to my funeral

10:04.506 --> 10:06.507
if I don't get this job
at Otisville today.

10:06.576 --> 10:08.043
There are no jobs.

10:08.110 --> 10:10.244
I saw it in the classifieds.
They're hiring.

10:10.312 --> 10:11.580
Forget about it.

10:11.647 --> 10:13.582
I got to go.
Yeah? How come?

10:13.649 --> 10:16.118
Denise will kill me.
They repo'd our car.

10:16.186 --> 10:18.487
Oh, boy.
Ouch.

10:18.555 --> 10:20.690
You want me
to go with you?

10:24.227 --> 10:29.398
Fifty cents! This is
a frigging waste of time.

10:29.466 --> 10:32.835
Four hundred people for one job?
One job? Give me a break.

10:32.903 --> 10:34.937
Guaranteed somebody's son,
cousin, Uncle

10:35.005 --> 10:36.939
already got this job
sewn up. Bye-bye.

10:37.007 --> 10:39.309
Why put it in the paper
if they're not hiring?

10:39.376 --> 10:41.511
It's a frigging runaround.
You mark my words.

10:41.579 --> 10:43.814
It's either, "we'll keep
your application on file"

10:43.881 --> 10:46.149
or they'll tell you,
"you're overqualified."

10:46.217 --> 10:49.019
Either way,
they screw you.

10:49.087 --> 10:50.386
Archibald.

10:50.454 --> 10:52.288
Yes.
John.

10:56.427 --> 10:59.296
I've been working
heavy machinery for 15 years.

10:59.364 --> 11:01.565
I really want the job.

11:01.634 --> 11:03.768
Anything you want,
I can do.

11:03.836 --> 11:05.169
I see.

11:05.237 --> 11:08.339
I can start today
if you need.

11:10.109 --> 11:12.910
Well, your resum
is very impressive.

11:12.978 --> 11:15.279
You've certainly got
the experience.

11:16.581 --> 11:20.653
Frankly, you may be
overqualified.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.255
We'll keep your application
on file.

11:35.568 --> 11:38.570
Dad, the game starts
in 15 minutes.

11:38.638 --> 11:40.238
We're going to be late.

11:42.943 --> 11:44.911
psst. Psst.

12:03.130 --> 12:05.399
Whoo! Knock it out, baby!
Knock it out!

12:05.466 --> 12:08.368
Come on! To the fence!
To the fence!

12:08.436 --> 12:10.771
Come on, Tommy!

12:10.839 --> 12:12.707
Come on, Tommy!

12:12.774 --> 12:15.743
Whoo! Come on.

12:15.811 --> 12:17.211
Ball four!

12:17.278 --> 12:22.249
All right, Tommy!
Whoo! Whoo!

12:22.317 --> 12:23.450
Let's go, Mikey!

12:23.518 --> 12:25.285
Let's go, Mikey,
let's go, baby.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.590
Let's go, son.
Okay. All right.

12:28.657 --> 12:31.326
Knock it out!
Knock it out!

12:31.393 --> 12:33.494
Keep your head
down on the ball, son.

12:33.562 --> 12:35.831
Knock it out
for your mama, baby.

12:35.898 --> 12:38.499
Come on, Mikey.
Come on, Mikey.

12:38.567 --> 12:39.768
Come on, Mikey.

12:39.836 --> 12:41.302
Sometime today, pitcher.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.571
Come on, Mikey!

12:43.639 --> 12:44.572
Strike!

12:44.640 --> 12:46.574
Strike? What?
Are you blind?

12:46.642 --> 12:48.577
Keep your head
down on the ball!

12:48.645 --> 12:50.579
I hate this pitcher.
How old is he?

12:50.647 --> 12:53.282
Twelve.
Twelve, my ass.

12:53.350 --> 12:55.752
His beard grew an inch
between pitches.

12:55.819 --> 12:57.086
Let's go, Mikey!

12:57.154 --> 12:59.655
Put your elbow up, son.
Elbow up.

12:59.723 --> 13:01.690
Go! Go, baby! Go!

13:01.759 --> 13:03.760
There you go, baby!

13:03.827 --> 13:04.827
Safe!

13:04.895 --> 13:07.696
Tie goes to the runner.

13:09.066 --> 13:10.968
Go! Go!

13:11.035 --> 13:12.602
Run! Run! Run! Run!

13:12.670 --> 13:16.140
Keep it going.
Let's go!

13:16.207 --> 13:20.010
Second base!
Second base!

13:20.078 --> 13:22.813
Second base!

13:25.616 --> 13:26.984
Mike!

13:29.587 --> 13:31.156
Mike.
Mikey!

13:31.223 --> 13:33.958
Michael? Michael?
Mikey, baby.

13:34.026 --> 13:35.860
Somebody call
an ambulance!

13:35.928 --> 13:37.561
Mikey. Mikey.

13:37.629 --> 13:38.663
Michael.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.965
Somebody call
a frigging ambulance!

13:44.003 --> 13:45.170
Get the door!

13:45.237 --> 13:46.871
Get the door,
Jimmy.

13:46.939 --> 13:48.706
Come on, let's go!

13:48.774 --> 13:50.275
I got it.

13:51.410 --> 13:52.443
Take him, baby.

13:52.511 --> 13:54.313
Give him to me.
Mikey, Mikey.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.782
Come on, baby, it's mama.
Come on, Mikey.

13:56.850 --> 13:59.985
We got to get
out of here. Mikey! Go!

14:29.917 --> 14:31.051
Help us!

14:31.118 --> 14:32.219
Help!
Please, somebody.

14:32.286 --> 14:33.419
Calm down.

14:33.487 --> 14:34.921
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

14:34.989 --> 14:37.124
All right,
come with me.

14:37.192 --> 14:40.094
He was just playing baseball,
running to second base.

14:40.162 --> 14:41.795
I don't know
what happened.

14:41.864 --> 14:44.431
I need a doctor
right away, please!

14:44.499 --> 14:45.466
No. Jesus.

14:45.533 --> 14:47.134
Mikey?
What happened?

14:47.202 --> 14:48.802
He collapsed
playing baseball.

14:48.871 --> 14:50.872
Let's get him
on some oxygen.

14:50.939 --> 14:53.474
He's going to be
all right, isn't he?

14:53.541 --> 14:55.409
Anything like this
ever happen before?

14:55.477 --> 14:56.443
No, ma'am.

14:56.511 --> 14:58.113
Any allergies?

14:58.181 --> 15:00.048
Nothing. Nothing!

15:00.116 --> 15:01.449
Allergies
to medication?

15:01.517 --> 15:02.784
No, he's fine.

15:02.852 --> 15:04.987
His liver's enlarged.
Flip him.

15:05.054 --> 15:06.721
He's going to be
all right, isn't he?

15:06.789 --> 15:09.925
Pulse is 150, pulse Ox 78%.
B.P. 68 over 34.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.260
What is the matter
with him?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.328
Would you come with me?

15:13.396 --> 15:14.997
There are procedures
we need to go over.

15:15.064 --> 15:15.998
What procedures?

15:16.065 --> 15:17.299
We're admitting your son.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.835
You need to fill out
the proper forms.

15:19.904 --> 15:21.504
Your son may need
a transfusion.

15:21.571 --> 15:23.672
We'll need to test you both
for blood type.

15:23.740 --> 15:25.808
Mikey, we're coming
right back, baby.

15:25.876 --> 15:28.077
Wait a minute!

15:28.145 --> 15:29.845
First name, Mr. Archibald.

15:29.914 --> 15:31.381
Uh, John.

15:31.448 --> 15:32.815
Middle initial?

15:32.883 --> 15:34.317
Q. Quincy.

15:34.385 --> 15:35.919
Name of your
insurance company?

15:35.986 --> 15:37.453
John!

15:37.521 --> 15:38.854
Where is he?
Is he okay?

15:38.923 --> 15:40.790
We don't know yet.
They're running tests.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.626
We're waiting
to find the results.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.228
Anything we can do?

15:44.296 --> 15:45.762
Your card,
Mr. Archibald.

15:45.830 --> 15:47.298
Mikey's hat.
I'm sorry.

15:47.365 --> 15:48.632
Your insurance card.

15:48.699 --> 15:51.701
I'll need to make a copy
for our files.

15:56.408 --> 15:58.876
It's okay.
You can go in now.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.542
Hey, sweetheart.

16:34.347 --> 16:36.248
How you doing, slugger?

16:39.218 --> 16:41.787
I can't talk.

16:41.855 --> 16:43.622
Don't worry about it.
Get your rest.

16:43.690 --> 16:46.258
We're going to be
out of here in a while.

16:46.326 --> 16:48.695
Okay.

16:48.763 --> 16:51.331
We love you, son.

16:51.398 --> 16:53.567
I love you, too.

16:56.403 --> 16:58.872
What is all this?

16:58.940 --> 17:01.842
This? This is so we can
monitor Mike's vitals.

17:01.909 --> 17:05.612
Respiratory rate,
pulse oximetry, heart rate.

17:05.680 --> 17:10.084
And this one is blood pressure--
diastolic and systolic.

17:10.151 --> 17:13.119
We'd like this top number
to stay above 90.

17:13.188 --> 17:14.655
If his blood pressure drops,

17:14.723 --> 17:15.790
we're going to have to
do something.

17:15.858 --> 17:17.925
We can't have him going
below 70 again.

17:17.992 --> 17:22.262
Why? What would that mean,
if he went below 70 again?

17:22.329 --> 17:25.733
70 and below,
he's in heart failure.

17:28.336 --> 17:29.704
Okay.

17:29.771 --> 17:31.106
If you need anything.

17:31.173 --> 17:32.273
Thank you.

17:39.181 --> 17:40.582
How's the company insurance?

17:40.650 --> 17:42.250
He works part time.

17:42.318 --> 17:44.686
She works
as a grocery store clerk.

17:44.754 --> 17:46.087
Can we do anything?

17:46.155 --> 17:48.189
I got to go.

17:48.257 --> 17:49.725
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald.

17:49.792 --> 17:52.495
Hello, I'm Rebecca Payne,
hospital director.

17:52.563 --> 17:54.330
Hi, there.
It's nice to meet you.

17:54.398 --> 17:56.465
This is Dr. Turner,
the head of cardiology

17:56.534 --> 17:57.600
and Michael's doctor.

17:57.668 --> 17:58.601
Oh. Okay.

17:58.669 --> 17:59.769
How do you do?

17:59.837 --> 18:01.270
Good. My wife.
Hello.

18:01.338 --> 18:02.805
How's our boy doing?

18:04.174 --> 18:05.675
Please sit down.

18:23.094 --> 18:24.695
Okay.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.868
This X-ray shows a normal
nine-year-old's heart.

18:30.936 --> 18:35.173
This X-ray is that
of your son Michael.

18:35.240 --> 18:41.145
There are septal defects
here, here, and here

18:41.213 --> 18:43.982
which have induced myopathy,
resulting pulmonary edema,

18:44.050 --> 18:45.817
and malignant
ventricular ectopy.

18:45.885 --> 18:48.319
As you can see,
Michael's heart is approximately

18:48.387 --> 18:50.488
three times larger
than normal size.

18:50.556 --> 18:53.058
I'm sorry. Uh...

18:53.125 --> 18:55.060
I didn't understand
what you said.

18:55.127 --> 18:57.063
Could you put that
in layman terms for me?

18:57.130 --> 18:58.598
Basically,
there's not enough blood

18:58.665 --> 19:01.701
being pumped
by Michael's heart,

19:01.768 --> 19:06.739
so it backs up in the lungs
like a sponge getting wet.

19:06.807 --> 19:10.242
His heart is trying,
but it's working too hard.

19:10.310 --> 19:13.012
What, does he need
an operation, or...

19:13.080 --> 19:16.716
Well, we're considerably
beyond corrective surgery,

19:16.783 --> 19:19.419
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald.

19:19.487 --> 19:21.387
Mike's heart is useless.

19:21.455 --> 19:24.290
He's going to need a transplant
or he's going to die.

19:26.894 --> 19:29.395
Wait a second.
There are other options.

19:29.463 --> 19:31.464
What options?

19:31.532 --> 19:32.933
To do nothing.

19:33.001 --> 19:36.369
Medicate him. Make him feel
as comfortable as possible.

19:36.437 --> 19:38.905
Start thinking
about quality of life now.

19:38.973 --> 19:40.708
I don't understand.

19:40.776 --> 19:45.446
We were just with him,
and he seemed fine.

19:45.514 --> 19:48.449
He's going to seem fine,
but as his heart gets worse,

19:48.517 --> 19:50.484
he will become
increasingly fatigued,

19:50.552 --> 19:53.487
and he will sleep
more and more,

19:53.555 --> 19:56.357
until one day
he will fall asleep,

19:56.424 --> 19:59.961
and he won't wake up.

20:00.029 --> 20:03.132
I know this is difficult,
but you have to face the fact

20:03.199 --> 20:06.301
that your son
may not live much longer.

20:06.369 --> 20:09.905
You might want to make it
a happy time, say good-bye.

20:11.607 --> 20:12.574
God.

20:12.642 --> 20:14.009
Transplantation
is high-risk.

20:14.077 --> 20:16.578
You could lose your son
on that table.

20:16.646 --> 20:19.048
You might not want
to take that chance.

20:21.885 --> 20:25.288
If you, you know, if he
doesn't have the surgery...

20:30.394 --> 20:33.396
If he doesn't have the surgery,
how long would he live?

20:33.463 --> 20:36.966
Not long.
Months, weeks.

20:37.034 --> 20:38.668
Days.

20:39.770 --> 20:43.372
Come on. All right.
All right. All right.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.141
Come on, now.

20:52.951 --> 20:56.220
I'm sorry. This--

20:56.287 --> 20:58.355
this is a lot.

21:14.207 --> 21:16.708
All right. Uh...

21:16.776 --> 21:19.177
Okay.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.312
If he was your son,
what would you do?

21:23.015 --> 21:25.984
I'd do the transplant,
absolutely.

21:26.052 --> 21:29.288
Okay. Okay?

21:31.258 --> 21:34.493
Okay, let's do that.
Let's do it.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.895
Yes?
Yes.

21:35.963 --> 21:39.132
Okay, first thing we've got
to do is get Mike's name

21:39.199 --> 21:40.867
on the organ recipient list.

21:40.934 --> 21:44.137
He's b-positive, so his name
should go right to the top.

21:44.204 --> 21:45.271
It's not so simple.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.939
There are
other considerations

21:47.007 --> 21:49.876
before a prospective recipient
can be placed on a donor list.

21:49.943 --> 21:52.545
Transplant surgery
is very expensive.

21:52.613 --> 21:54.748
In most cases,
prohibitively so.

21:54.816 --> 21:58.085
Oh, we got insurance,
major medical. He's covered.

21:58.153 --> 22:00.020
We've already checked
with your carrier.

22:00.088 --> 22:01.955
There are no provisions
in your policy

22:02.023 --> 22:03.791
for a procedure
of this magnitude.

22:03.858 --> 22:06.226
Oh, no, no, no,
that's a mistake.

22:06.294 --> 22:08.295
Not that you're making
a mistake.

22:08.362 --> 22:10.798
I'm just saying
that I'm insured.

22:10.865 --> 22:12.500
My son's covered.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.203
Mrs. Archibald,
do you have coverage?

22:15.271 --> 22:17.371
No. I've only been
at the supermarket

22:17.439 --> 22:20.041
a couple months, and you
don't get benefits until--

22:20.109 --> 22:22.043
doesn't matter.
We got insurance.

22:24.379 --> 22:27.648
Okay, I can see here that
you don't own your home.

22:27.716 --> 22:30.451
You have no stocks,
no bonds, no investments.

22:30.519 --> 22:32.921
You have a little over $1,000
in savings.

22:32.988 --> 22:34.122
But we got insurance.

22:34.191 --> 22:36.058
That may be.
Check with your carrier.

22:36.126 --> 22:37.726
In the meantime,

22:37.794 --> 22:40.395
we're going to have to
treat this as a cash account.

22:40.463 --> 22:41.463
What?

22:41.531 --> 22:43.465
How much
does a transplant cost?

22:43.533 --> 22:46.468
Let me take care--
how much does it cost?

22:46.536 --> 22:48.871
Transplant surgery,
doctors' fees,

22:48.939 --> 22:51.006
postoperative care,
immunosuppressant drugs--

22:51.074 --> 22:54.143
you're looking
at a minimum of $250,000.

22:54.211 --> 22:55.277
Wow.

22:55.345 --> 22:57.347
If you opt
for transplant surgery,

22:57.414 --> 22:58.882
that is your choice,

22:58.950 --> 23:01.384
but the hospital maintains
a very strict policy

23:01.452 --> 23:03.186
with regard
to cash patients.

23:03.254 --> 23:05.555
We require a down payment

23:05.622 --> 23:08.158
before we put a patient's name
on a receivers' list.

23:08.226 --> 23:10.593
How much?

23:10.661 --> 23:14.164
30%--$75,000.

23:14.232 --> 23:16.399
$75,000...

23:18.536 --> 23:20.504
To put my son's name
on a list.

23:20.572 --> 23:23.640
Our son is dying, and all you
can do is talk about money?

23:23.708 --> 23:25.943
It costs money
to provide health care.

23:26.011 --> 23:29.513
It's expensive for you,
it's expensive for us.

23:29.581 --> 23:31.883
I'm sorry. You're going to
have to guarantee payment

23:31.950 --> 23:34.285
before I can put
your son's name on the list.

23:36.889 --> 23:39.724
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald,
please wait!

23:40.960 --> 23:43.061
If you people don't want
to treat our son,

23:43.129 --> 23:45.264
we'll take him
over to county memorial.

23:45.331 --> 23:46.698
You don't want to do that.

23:46.766 --> 23:48.200
They have to treat him.

23:48.268 --> 23:50.668
No. Heart transplantation
is always considered

23:50.736 --> 23:52.170
an elective procedure.

23:52.238 --> 23:53.705
You're
in the right place.

23:53.773 --> 23:55.640
What are we
supposed to do?

23:55.708 --> 23:57.575
Talk to your
insurance company again.

23:57.643 --> 23:59.511
Check with our
human resources department

23:59.578 --> 24:00.712
for medical assistance.

24:00.780 --> 24:01.881
There's money there.

24:01.949 --> 24:04.083
There's children's
state services and medicaid.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.085
You find a way
to keep him here.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.788
You just don't take no
for an answer.

24:10.124 --> 24:13.626
Your policy has changed,
Mr. Archibald.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.329
Changed to what?

24:16.397 --> 24:18.331
Yeah, we've recently
switched carriers

24:18.399 --> 24:20.699
from a PPO to an HMO.

24:20.767 --> 24:22.402
It's a less expensive
policy,

24:22.469 --> 24:25.339
but unfortunately,
there are some restrictions.

24:25.407 --> 24:27.007
What kind of restrictions?

24:27.075 --> 24:29.243
Here's how it works.

24:29.311 --> 24:31.946
Non-management part-time
employees such as yourself

24:32.013 --> 24:35.082
only qualify for second-tier
catastrophic coverage.

24:35.150 --> 24:37.551
No, no, I'm not part time,
I'm full time.

24:37.618 --> 24:39.186
It's just slow right now.

24:39.254 --> 24:42.656
Sure, but your coverage
is based on hours worked,

24:42.723 --> 24:45.526
and like I said, you only
qualify for second tier,

24:45.594 --> 24:48.763
and that has a maximum
payout limit of $20,000.

24:48.831 --> 24:50.665
What?

24:53.169 --> 24:55.536
You have been taking money
out of my check every week.

24:55.604 --> 24:58.406
I've been paying into
this policy for years.

24:58.474 --> 25:01.276
That's why we're going to
cover you for the full $20,000.

25:02.478 --> 25:05.413
You're kidding me, right?
I mean, come on.

25:05.481 --> 25:06.915
Let me get this straight.

25:06.984 --> 25:10.953
You have dropped me
from full time to part time.

25:11.021 --> 25:12.421
<i>You switched carriers.</i>

25:12.489 --> 25:14.590
Now you're telling me
I'm not fully covered

25:14.657 --> 25:18.194
even though I got a policy
that says I am?

25:18.261 --> 25:20.196
It doesn't seem right,
does it?

25:20.263 --> 25:22.631
No, it doesn't.
My son is very sick.

25:22.699 --> 25:25.201
If I'm not covered,
I got a serious problem.

25:25.268 --> 25:28.571
I understand that,
but there's nothing I can do.

25:28.639 --> 25:30.474
Look, you can file
an appeal.

25:30.541 --> 25:31.541
Yeah?

25:31.609 --> 25:33.043
Here you go.

25:33.111 --> 25:35.712
That takes about seven
working days.

25:50.795 --> 25:53.131
Says here you already
have medical insurance.

25:53.198 --> 25:54.265
Not enough.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.401
What little we have
is already used up.

25:56.468 --> 25:58.936
You on welfare?
No.

25:59.004 --> 26:01.272
You should be on welfare.

26:01.340 --> 26:03.174
Welfare?
We both have jobs.

26:03.242 --> 26:04.842
That's too bad.

26:04.910 --> 26:07.045
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

26:07.112 --> 26:08.913
Try county medical.

26:08.980 --> 26:11.583
Yes, ma'am, I need to speak
to somebody in financial aid.

26:13.353 --> 26:15.154
No, I don't want to hold.

26:15.221 --> 26:17.822
I've been holding 15 minutes.
I don't want to hold.

26:21.161 --> 26:23.095
What? Should I get
another job?

26:23.163 --> 26:24.196
I'm not yelling.

26:24.264 --> 26:26.798
Yes, you're yelling
in here!

26:33.840 --> 26:35.275
Next, please.

26:39.813 --> 26:42.282
Oh, wrong line.
Window 15.

26:42.349 --> 26:43.783
What?

26:43.850 --> 26:45.151
Window 15.

27:02.971 --> 27:04.438
no.

27:04.506 --> 27:05.439
No what?

27:05.507 --> 27:07.141
No, you don't qualify.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.642
My son is dying,
I'm broke.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.578
If I don't qualify,
who the hell does?

27:10.645 --> 27:12.246
I'm sorry.

27:12.314 --> 27:14.681
I don't need you to be sorry!
I need you to help me!

27:39.209 --> 27:42.512
no, no, no,
this is an appeal.

27:42.579 --> 27:44.947
An appeal is for
an already existing claim.

27:45.015 --> 27:47.383
What you needed to file
was a grievance.

27:47.451 --> 27:49.118
You filed
the wrong paperwork.

27:49.186 --> 27:51.354
You're going to
have to resubmit.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.022
It could take 30 days.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.923
I don't have 30 days.
I know.

27:54.991 --> 27:56.759
I'm getting sick
of the runaround.

27:56.826 --> 27:59.762
What I need is my son's
name on that list.

27:59.829 --> 28:02.533
Your account is
in excess of $30,000.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.335
The hospital has bent over
backwards to help you out.

28:05.403 --> 28:06.403
Is that right?

28:06.471 --> 28:08.272
<i>Yes, it is right.</i>

28:08.339 --> 28:10.574
But there is a limit
to our generosity.

28:10.642 --> 28:11.975
Once and for all,

28:12.043 --> 28:14.144
your insurance
does not cover this.

28:26.459 --> 28:27.892
Jimmy.

28:34.033 --> 28:35.099
Take it.

28:35.168 --> 28:36.301
Watch your step.

28:36.369 --> 28:38.603
This thing is frigging heavy.

28:41.874 --> 28:43.709
Get out of the way.

28:43.777 --> 28:45.044
Friends...

29:34.062 --> 29:37.699
"You can't say that
you're not going to pitch.

29:37.766 --> 29:39.834
"Bernie frowned,
puzzled by babe's answer..."

29:39.901 --> 29:41.135
Hey.

29:44.707 --> 29:46.641
Let us pray.

29:46.709 --> 29:50.246
God of mercy, into his hands
your son Jesus Christ

29:50.313 --> 29:53.048
commended his spirit
at his last hour.

29:53.116 --> 29:57.152
Into those same hands,
we commend your servant...

30:00.757 --> 30:02.824
You know, you should try
that news guy

30:02.892 --> 30:05.160
does all them special
investigative reports.

30:05.228 --> 30:07.896
You know the one, the guy
with the frigging hair?

30:07.964 --> 30:09.531
Pretty boy.
What's his name?

30:09.599 --> 30:10.700
Lampley.

30:10.768 --> 30:12.001
Tuck Lampley.

30:12.069 --> 30:14.738
Hey, I'll give you $20
for the TV.

30:14.805 --> 30:16.373
It's a color TV.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.674
Twenty dollars.

30:21.579 --> 30:23.079
Call him up, Jimmy.

30:23.147 --> 30:25.014
You don't mind
if we walk and talk.

30:25.082 --> 30:26.215
I'm up to here today.

30:26.284 --> 30:27.450
Not at all.

30:27.518 --> 30:28.785
What can I do you for?

30:28.852 --> 30:31.921
My son Mike,
he fell into heart failure

30:31.989 --> 30:34.091
at this little league game.

30:34.159 --> 30:36.093
I got full insurance
from the job.

30:36.161 --> 30:38.496
Now they're telling me
they won't pay.

30:38.563 --> 30:40.731
What about the hospital?
Don't they have to cover it?

30:40.799 --> 30:42.333
That's what I was saying.

30:42.401 --> 30:44.201
They're telling me
I got to pay cash.

30:44.269 --> 30:47.738
Otherwise I got to take
my son home and watch him die.

30:47.806 --> 30:51.041
We was thinking you can do one
of them special interest pieces.

30:51.109 --> 30:53.110
Send donations,
write your congressman.

30:53.178 --> 30:56.047
Anything you can do,
Mr. Lampley, would help.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.850
I think what's happening
to your son is outrageous.

30:58.918 --> 31:01.453
I want to help, but I got to
run this by my producers.

31:01.521 --> 31:04.222
I got bosses
like everybody else.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.257
Leave your number
with Karen up front.

31:07.293 --> 31:09.428
Okay.
Thank you very much.

31:09.495 --> 31:10.462
Okay.

31:24.611 --> 31:26.212
Give me $100.
Give me $100.

31:27.914 --> 31:29.849
Come on,
it's a diamond ring.

31:29.916 --> 31:32.184
All right, $90.
Give me $90, then.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.160
Hello.

32:13.228 --> 32:15.397
He's going to die.

32:15.464 --> 32:18.099
What?
They're releasing him.

32:18.166 --> 32:19.166
Who?

32:19.234 --> 32:23.205
Dr. Turner
just left here,

32:23.273 --> 32:27.075
and they are releasing Mike
this morning.

32:27.143 --> 32:29.077
Baby, hold on. They're not
going to send him home.

32:29.145 --> 32:30.979
I gave them money yesterday.

32:31.047 --> 32:32.715
It doesn't matter.
Listen to me.

32:32.783 --> 32:34.650
They are releasing him.

32:34.718 --> 32:36.685
Baby, I talked
to the hospital.

32:36.753 --> 32:38.687
They said--
I'll take care of it.

32:38.755 --> 32:40.756
John, you always
take care of everything,

32:40.824 --> 32:42.591
but it's never enough,
is it?

32:42.660 --> 32:45.662
You need to do something,
do you hear me?

32:45.730 --> 32:47.497
Do something!

33:31.845 --> 33:33.445
You're doing great.

33:33.513 --> 33:35.213
You've gained what,
five pounds?

33:35.281 --> 33:36.314
Wow.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.883
You're the only patient
I have

33:37.951 --> 33:40.919
who eats the food
in this place.

33:40.987 --> 33:42.754
Doc, let me
ask you something.

33:42.822 --> 33:44.790
How long before I'm able
to play tennis?

33:44.858 --> 33:47.793
You couldn't play
before you had a new heart.

33:47.862 --> 33:49.328
Take up knitting.

33:49.396 --> 33:51.598
I play tennis.
We don't care.

33:51.665 --> 33:54.200
Would you please get back to work?
Thank you.

33:54.267 --> 33:56.836
Make an appointment for us
to have dinner next week.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.170
I'm going to cook.

33:58.238 --> 33:59.939
No, and you're not
wearing lingerie

34:00.007 --> 34:01.574
around him
the next month.

34:01.642 --> 34:04.043
You're not in his will.
He told me.

34:04.111 --> 34:05.612
Don't push your luck.

34:05.679 --> 34:08.781
I gave the hospital
$6,000 yesterday.

34:11.085 --> 34:12.520
Can I talk to you?

34:12.587 --> 34:13.721
Yes, sure.

34:15.422 --> 34:16.356
Okay.

34:18.827 --> 34:19.994
Take care of him.

34:20.061 --> 34:21.728
Take care.
Thank you.

34:26.768 --> 34:29.737
My wife Denise says you're
going to send Michael home.

34:29.804 --> 34:31.505
Is that true?

34:31.574 --> 34:33.875
I'm a physician.
I don't make policy decisions.

34:33.943 --> 34:36.545
That's handled
by the board of trustees.

34:36.612 --> 34:38.780
You're head of cardiac surgery.
You make a recommendation,

34:38.848 --> 34:40.380
they're going to listen,
aren't they?

34:40.449 --> 34:42.216
I make recommendations
all the time.

34:42.284 --> 34:44.553
The final decision rests
with the board, not me.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.987
That's it?
Send him home.

34:47.056 --> 34:49.389
I'm afraid so.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.326
Can we take a little walk?

34:52.393 --> 34:54.329
It won't take long,
I promise you.

34:54.397 --> 34:56.565
<i>Fine. Fine.</i>

34:56.632 --> 35:00.069
So I'm looking
at the brochure last night.

35:00.136 --> 35:04.740
It says this hospital does over
300 heart surgeries a year.

35:04.808 --> 35:07.677
300 surgeries,
$250,000 a pop.

35:07.744 --> 35:10.212
You know how much that is?
I did the math.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.882
That's $75 million worth
of heart surgeries.

35:12.950 --> 35:16.419
You're telling me you can't
do one for me in good faith?

35:16.487 --> 35:19.122
I waived my fee
in your son's case.

35:19.190 --> 35:21.257
Nobody asked you
to waive the fee.

35:21.325 --> 35:22.893
I can raise the money.

35:22.961 --> 35:25.228
I already
came up with $22,000,

35:25.296 --> 35:28.498
and I swear to God
on my life I will pay for this

35:28.566 --> 35:30.601
if you just give me
the opportunity.

35:30.668 --> 35:33.737
I'm only getting 20 hours
on the job. I can do this.

35:33.805 --> 35:37.441
I can pay. I swear to God,
I'll pay you the money back.

35:37.509 --> 35:39.577
I don't know how,
but I promise I will.

35:39.645 --> 35:41.079
Just trust me.

35:41.146 --> 35:44.849
I give you my word
as a man. Please.

35:46.952 --> 35:49.520
Could you take your hands
off me, please?

35:51.991 --> 35:54.358
I've done everything I can.
I'm sorry.

35:54.426 --> 35:55.593
No.
Yes.

35:55.661 --> 35:58.530
Let's go inside
and talk about it.

36:01.801 --> 36:03.168
Aah!

36:03.236 --> 36:05.871
I'm not asking anymore, doctor.
I'm telling you.

36:05.939 --> 36:09.008
You are going to give my son
a new heart, you understand me?

36:09.075 --> 36:11.376
Yes. Yes.

36:12.411 --> 36:14.479
Okay.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.214
Um...

36:16.282 --> 36:18.083
Okay.

36:18.151 --> 36:19.718
Don't move.

36:20.955 --> 36:22.588
Don't move.

36:30.998 --> 36:32.766
<i>Don't.
Don't even think about it.</i>

36:32.833 --> 36:34.100
Okay.

36:34.168 --> 36:36.903
Put your hands down.
Just put them down.

36:36.971 --> 36:38.571
Mr. Archibald, I...
Shut up.

36:38.639 --> 36:40.239
I know how upset you are.

36:40.307 --> 36:41.976
This is not the way
to handle it.

36:42.044 --> 36:43.978
You can't go through
this way.

36:44.046 --> 36:46.280
Put your ha--
put your hands up.

36:46.347 --> 36:47.915
Put 'em up.
Put 'em up.

36:47.983 --> 36:49.583
Oh, God. Oh, God.

36:49.651 --> 36:50.818
Give me your gun.

36:50.886 --> 36:52.086
I don't have a gun.

36:52.154 --> 36:53.287
They're not armed.

36:53.354 --> 36:55.056
Okay. All right,
all right.

36:55.123 --> 36:58.092
Put your hands down.
Sit down. No, no, get up.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.327
You fail
to realize the jeopardy...

37:00.395 --> 37:01.762
Shut up!

37:01.830 --> 37:03.297
Shut up. Don't move.

37:03.364 --> 37:04.966
John, wait. Wait.

37:05.034 --> 37:08.704
Just stop. Stop!
Stop. Stop! Just stop.

37:08.771 --> 37:12.240
If you do this, you're on an
irreversible course of action.

37:12.308 --> 37:14.676
Put on the brakes
and think about this.

37:14.744 --> 37:15.877
We need to talk.

37:15.945 --> 37:17.445
Mr. Archibald,
I hope--

37:17.513 --> 37:18.546
back up, please.

37:18.614 --> 37:19.881
Do as he says.
What?

37:19.949 --> 37:21.282
Would you please
back up?

37:21.350 --> 37:22.884
What are you doing?

37:22.952 --> 37:24.886
I'm not taking no
for an answer. Back up.

37:24.954 --> 37:26.689
That guy's got a gun!

37:26.757 --> 37:28.725
Hey! Hey!

37:28.792 --> 37:30.159
Stay right there.

37:32.062 --> 37:34.363
Hey!

37:34.431 --> 37:36.065
Hey!

37:36.133 --> 37:38.201
Hey, what are you doing?

37:38.268 --> 37:40.002
Get back over there.
Sit on your hands.

37:40.070 --> 37:41.904
Sit on your hands
over there!

37:41.972 --> 37:44.907
Get over there!
Turner, everybody, get down!

37:44.975 --> 37:47.310
Turner, get down!
Sit on your hands!

37:47.378 --> 37:49.646
Put your hands
under your butt!

37:49.714 --> 37:52.015
Don't anybody move.

37:57.055 --> 37:59.089
Hey,
what are you doing?

37:59.157 --> 38:03.360
I'm bleeding. Trying to get
my finger sewn back on.

38:03.427 --> 38:07.497
Mr. Archibald, these people
have nothing to do with this.

38:07.565 --> 38:09.234
Let them go.
They need treatment.

38:09.301 --> 38:11.236
This is a hospital.
You're a doctor.

38:11.303 --> 38:13.772
Why don't you treat them?
Start with him.

38:14.974 --> 38:16.241
What's the matter, doctor?

38:16.308 --> 38:18.609
You want to see
his insurance card first?

38:19.845 --> 38:22.346
I'll do it.
Okay, you do it.

38:22.414 --> 38:25.016
Wait a minute.
I got a pregnant wife here.

38:25.084 --> 38:27.051
Okay, all right.

38:28.821 --> 38:30.689
Listen, all right, wait.
Listen, everybody.

38:30.757 --> 38:33.425
Uh...All right.

38:33.493 --> 38:36.896
Hey, the hospital's
under new management now.

38:36.963 --> 38:38.630
Yeah.

38:38.698 --> 38:42.101
From now on, free health care
for everybody. How's that?

38:42.169 --> 38:44.036
Righteous, man.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.305
Don't have to squeeze it like--
you crazy?

38:46.372 --> 38:47.773
What's your name?

38:47.841 --> 38:49.474
Max.

38:49.542 --> 38:51.877
Max, you and Dr. Turner
come with me.

38:51.945 --> 38:53.880
You got keys
for that elevator?

38:53.948 --> 38:55.115
Yeah.

38:55.183 --> 38:57.383
Kill the power.
Turn it off.

39:17.005 --> 39:18.372
Keep an eye on him, Max.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.707
You got to sit still.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.709
I can't do this
with you moving around.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.445
You remind me
of doogie howser.

39:24.512 --> 39:26.814
Hey, we were here
before the black guy.

39:26.882 --> 39:28.649
Everybody's
going to get their turn.

39:28.717 --> 39:30.651
We're not going anywhere.
Just sit tight.

39:32.387 --> 39:34.355
You just relax, okay?

39:44.467 --> 39:45.868
Hello.

39:45.935 --> 39:47.202
Hello.

39:47.270 --> 39:49.238
<i>Hello, is this
hope memorial hospital?</i>

39:49.305 --> 39:51.340
Yeah, emergency room.

39:51.407 --> 39:54.343
<i>Could you give me directions?
I need to get over there.</i>

39:54.410 --> 39:55.677
<i>No.
What?</i>

39:55.745 --> 39:58.748
No, ma'am. We're closed
for repairs right now.

39:58.815 --> 40:00.250
You're going to
have to call--

40:00.317 --> 40:02.185
<i>this is an emergency!</i>

40:02.253 --> 40:04.120
I understand that it's
an emergency, ma'am.

40:04.188 --> 40:05.821
Have you tried
mount angel?

40:05.890 --> 40:08.424
<i>That's too far.
I don't know how to get there.</i>

40:08.492 --> 40:11.394
<i>My husband usually drives.
I'm going to need directions.</i>

40:11.461 --> 40:13.129
Which way
are you coming from?

40:15.065 --> 40:16.933
Go down flower,
make a right,

40:17.001 --> 40:19.469
go all the way
to the end, make a left.

40:19.537 --> 40:21.205
I'm asking you
to do something.

40:21.273 --> 40:23.507
You're welcome.
Miss, come from under there.

40:23.574 --> 40:24.708
Hey.

40:24.776 --> 40:26.843
Hey. Hey!

40:26.912 --> 40:29.246
Come from out of there.
Come on out.

40:29.314 --> 40:32.283
- What?

40:32.350 --> 40:33.750
Go sit over there.

40:35.086 --> 40:37.554
Unbelievable.
This place is a joke.

40:37.622 --> 40:39.356
Good thing I'm not cut.

40:39.424 --> 40:41.759
I'd bleed to death
in this joint, am I right?

40:41.827 --> 40:44.662
Excuse me, brother man!

40:44.730 --> 40:47.865
No. You need to do something,
Steve, all right?

40:47.934 --> 40:50.035
You need
to get your butt up!

40:50.102 --> 40:52.437
Steve, I want you
to get up and do something.

40:52.504 --> 40:55.706
Would you sit down?
No!

40:55.774 --> 40:57.842
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Hey! Whoa!

40:57.910 --> 40:59.277
Wait a minute. Relax.

40:59.345 --> 41:01.446
Don't have the baby yet.
When is it due?

41:01.513 --> 41:02.982
Any minute.

41:03.050 --> 41:04.483
Okay, don't have it.

41:04.551 --> 41:05.484
I'm having it.

41:05.552 --> 41:07.086
- Not yet.
- Brother.

41:07.154 --> 41:09.521
She's having a baby.
Hang on a second.

41:09.589 --> 41:10.957
Excuse me, brother man.

41:11.024 --> 41:13.592
Can you hang on?!
The woman's having a baby!

41:13.660 --> 41:14.961
When is she
going to see a doctor?

41:15.028 --> 41:15.962
Sit down!

41:16.029 --> 41:17.129
Señor!

41:17.197 --> 41:18.130
Sit down.

41:18.198 --> 41:19.631
That's cool, man.
Dr. Klein!

41:19.699 --> 41:21.834
I'll be there
in a minute.

41:21.901 --> 41:23.635
You and me,
we got no problems.

41:23.703 --> 41:25.939
That's right.
Just stay in your seat.

41:31.312 --> 41:33.580
I don't understand
what you're saying, ma'am.

41:36.050 --> 41:37.217
The ear? Ear infection?

41:39.354 --> 41:40.954
Can you help her
with the ear infection?

41:41.022 --> 41:42.155
- Me?
- You.

41:42.223 --> 41:44.591
I can't.
Why not?

41:44.658 --> 41:47.028
I don't know anything.
It's my first day.

41:57.706 --> 41:59.807
All right, everybody,
in the other room.

41:59.875 --> 42:02.910
Everybody, in the other room
right now. In other room.

42:02.978 --> 42:05.779
They're going to take
great care of you, I promise.

42:05.847 --> 42:07.749
Okay?

42:07.817 --> 42:09.951
What? Open up!

42:10.020 --> 42:12.654
Open up. We've got
a gunshot victim out here.

42:12.722 --> 42:14.823
He's lost a lot of blood.
Let's go.

42:14.891 --> 42:16.958
Go to another hospital.

42:17.027 --> 42:18.160
Let's go. Open the door.

42:18.228 --> 42:20.629
You know these guys?
Yeah.

42:20.696 --> 42:22.297
You sure?

42:22.365 --> 42:24.699
Yeah, they're here
all the time.

42:24.767 --> 42:26.001
Open the door.

42:28.104 --> 42:29.204
Take your jacket off.

42:29.272 --> 42:31.607
What?

42:31.675 --> 42:34.777
Open it up.
Take it off.

42:34.845 --> 42:37.547
Just put it on the ground.
Just walk away.

42:37.614 --> 42:40.083
Just leave them
right there. Go. Go!

42:41.585 --> 42:42.919
Just go.

42:45.423 --> 42:47.390
What's wrong with him?

42:47.458 --> 42:49.359
He got shot.

42:55.233 --> 42:56.833
All right, come on.

43:07.145 --> 43:08.679
Hey, hey, hey,
wait a minute.

43:08.746 --> 43:10.847
I want to see
what's in that bag.

43:10.915 --> 43:12.917
What happened
to you, buddy?

43:12.985 --> 43:16.688
I gave them
all the money in the register.

43:16.755 --> 43:18.990
They shot me anyway.

43:19.058 --> 43:22.360
Jesus Christ. He needs to go
into surgery right now.

43:22.428 --> 43:24.362
Can I take him
to trauma one?

43:24.430 --> 43:25.697
Okay.
Thanks.

43:25.764 --> 43:27.065
What do we got?

43:27.133 --> 43:28.567
Gunshot wound
to the belly.

43:28.634 --> 43:30.068
Anything from the EMTS?

43:30.136 --> 43:32.737
No. Dr. Turner,
we're going to need your hand.

43:32.805 --> 43:34.640
I just bought this suit.

43:34.708 --> 43:36.509
Can you give me a hand?

43:36.577 --> 43:39.245
On three,
two, one, lift.

43:39.313 --> 43:41.847
Thank you.

43:41.915 --> 43:44.183
Oh, no, I can't handle this.
This is a gut shot.

43:44.251 --> 43:46.552
I'm a cardiac surgeon, not an
emergency room physician.

43:46.620 --> 43:48.554
It's like
riding a bike, doctor.

43:48.622 --> 43:50.389
Just pretend
you're getting paid.

43:50.457 --> 43:52.592
No, this is apples
and oranges. I can't.

43:52.659 --> 43:54.160
The man is dying.
Help him.

43:54.228 --> 43:56.530
I haven't done this--
do it!

43:58.866 --> 44:01.268
75 milligrams demerol I.V.,
Lidocaine 2% local.

44:01.336 --> 44:02.536
I'll scrub now.

44:02.604 --> 44:04.538
I'm putting him
to sleep.

44:04.606 --> 44:07.274
When I get out of here,
I'm suing your security company.

44:07.342 --> 44:09.610
What makes you sure
you're getting out at all?

44:21.357 --> 44:22.390
Right behind you!

44:22.458 --> 44:24.225
Here we go.

44:37.339 --> 44:40.409
You've got to stand
behind the line, sir.

44:40.477 --> 44:44.446
Move this out of here for me,
please? Thank you very much.

44:44.514 --> 44:47.582
Lieutenant,
we got a real problem here.

44:47.650 --> 44:50.552
This guy's in for the long
haul--locked down the E.R.,

44:50.620 --> 44:52.954
barricaded himself in,
killed power in the elevators.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.723
We can bust down the door,

44:54.790 --> 44:57.192
but this son of a bitch
might start killing people.

44:57.260 --> 44:59.761
There's two pinpoint cameras
hidden in the E.R.

44:59.829 --> 45:01.263
The hospital's
own surveillance.

45:01.331 --> 45:02.932
We got a video tap
being set up.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.667
Are you in charge
of security?

45:04.735 --> 45:07.537
No. Wally Pitoniak.
It's his day off.

45:07.604 --> 45:10.873
Not anymore, it ain't.
Get him down here.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.911
All right, can you get me
a secure line?

45:14.978 --> 45:17.013
Lieutenant, we've got
one of our guys inside.

45:17.081 --> 45:19.649
He's got a walkie-talkie.
You might want to try this.

45:19.716 --> 45:22.618
Put a clamp on all phone lines
to the emergency room.

45:22.686 --> 45:25.722
If this guy picks up the phone,
I want him talking to me, okay?

45:25.790 --> 45:27.024
Done.

45:27.092 --> 45:28.659
Now, who's in charge here?

45:28.726 --> 45:31.862
Rebecca Payne, sir.
It's her day off, too.

45:31.930 --> 45:34.331
Jesus Christ, does anybody
work at this hospital?

45:34.399 --> 45:35.866
It's Saturday, sir.

45:35.934 --> 45:40.071
So what? People get sick
on Saturday, don't they?

45:42.640 --> 45:44.475
Aah!

45:44.543 --> 45:46.178
Señor, señor, señor.
Yeah.

45:46.245 --> 45:49.214
No cry. No cry.

45:49.282 --> 45:50.482
Yeah.

45:50.550 --> 45:51.983
Aah!

45:52.051 --> 45:55.220
Mr. Archibald, I need to do
an internal examination on her.

45:55.288 --> 45:56.654
Where you
going to take her?

45:56.722 --> 45:57.956
Examination room there.

45:58.023 --> 45:58.990
Good. Go.

45:59.058 --> 46:00.358
Come on, baby.

46:00.426 --> 46:02.294
Ohh. Ohh!

46:03.729 --> 46:05.730
Whew. Ohh, sh--

46:07.000 --> 46:09.268
Just remember,
it ain't your fault.

46:09.336 --> 46:11.137
Excuse me.

46:11.205 --> 46:13.772
I think my fianc e
might have broken her arm.

46:13.840 --> 46:16.509
I was wondering if we could
get somebody to look at her.

46:16.577 --> 46:18.077
Yeah, sure.
What happened?

46:18.145 --> 46:19.778
A drunk
ran a red light--

46:19.846 --> 46:22.081
ran a red light.
He slammed into us. Right?

46:22.149 --> 46:24.049
Yep. It was
an accident.

46:24.118 --> 46:26.586
Yes, it was.

46:26.653 --> 46:29.223
<i>This is
the police department.</i>

46:29.290 --> 46:31.558
<i>I'm speaking
to the man in charge.</i>

46:31.626 --> 46:34.294
<i>Please pick up
the walkie-talkie.</i>

46:34.362 --> 46:37.397
<i>The building is surrounded.
There's no way in or out.</i>

46:37.465 --> 46:40.167
<i>If you hear me,
I advise you to respond.</i>

46:41.136 --> 46:43.270
<i>Hello?</i>

46:43.338 --> 46:45.405
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>

46:46.441 --> 46:47.941
Yeah.

46:48.009 --> 46:49.476
This is
Lieutenant Frank Grimes

46:49.544 --> 46:51.446
of the Chicago
Police Department.

46:51.514 --> 46:53.714
Are you the man in charge?

46:55.784 --> 46:57.252
That's right.

46:57.319 --> 46:59.187
Who am I speaking to?

47:00.922 --> 47:02.123
John...

47:03.859 --> 47:05.059
Q.

47:06.828 --> 47:08.929
All right, John Q.

47:08.997 --> 47:12.468
Again, I'm Lieutenant Grimes,
but I want you to call me Frank.

47:12.536 --> 47:13.902
Can you do that?

47:13.970 --> 47:15.404
Sure, Frank.

47:15.472 --> 47:17.105
I'll be
the hostage negotiator.

47:17.174 --> 47:19.908
I've been a cop 35 years.
This is all I do.

47:19.976 --> 47:22.010
I don't play games.
I don't fool around.

47:22.078 --> 47:25.181
If I say something,
you can take it to the bank.

47:25.248 --> 47:26.915
Let's get down to it.

47:26.983 --> 47:29.485
Is anybody hurt?

47:29.553 --> 47:31.687
It's an emergency room.
Everybody's hurt.

47:31.754 --> 47:33.021
Oh, right.

47:33.089 --> 47:34.658
They're fine.
Good.

47:34.725 --> 47:38.161
As long as it stays that way,
we can keep talking.

47:38.229 --> 47:39.696
What is it you want?

47:39.763 --> 47:42.098
You find Rebecca Payne,

47:42.166 --> 47:44.601
Hope Memorial's
administrative supervisor.

47:44.669 --> 47:45.835
You find her.

47:45.903 --> 47:49.105
Tell her I want my kid's name
on the donors' list.

47:49.173 --> 47:52.175
You got that? My kid's name
on the donors' list.

47:52.243 --> 47:53.643
Kid boy or girl?

47:53.711 --> 47:54.944
A boy.

47:55.012 --> 47:59.483
I got two boys myself, John.
Two girls and two boys.

47:59.551 --> 48:02.152
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't handle me, Frank.

48:02.221 --> 48:03.821
I don't want to be handled.

48:03.888 --> 48:06.156
It insults my intelligence
as a human being!

48:06.225 --> 48:09.527
Take it easy. The idea
is not to get too excited.

48:09.595 --> 48:12.363
I'm going to take it any way
I can get it, understand?

48:12.431 --> 48:14.332
If I don't get it,
there's going to be

48:14.399 --> 48:16.601
some dead bodies
on your hands in there.

48:16.668 --> 48:18.169
You understand me?

48:18.238 --> 48:20.004
I hear you loud and clear.

48:20.072 --> 48:22.241
I'm going to jot that down.
Rebecca Payne, right?

48:22.308 --> 48:23.975
All right.

48:24.043 --> 48:27.846
Now, there's a lot of cops
out here, John.

48:27.913 --> 48:30.515
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

48:30.583 --> 48:32.251
Yeah, I'm sure.

48:33.353 --> 48:34.753
All right, sit tight.

48:34.820 --> 48:36.655
You're in a tough spot,
John, a lot of trouble,

48:36.723 --> 48:39.325
but if you work with me,
if you're reasonable,

48:39.393 --> 48:41.527
we'll figure a way
out of this, okay?

48:41.595 --> 48:43.763
We have to have a little faith
in one another.

48:43.830 --> 48:45.365
Why is that, Frank?

48:45.432 --> 48:46.899
Why?

48:46.967 --> 48:48.901
Because that's what faith's
all about--

48:48.969 --> 48:52.672
believing when you don't want
to believe.

48:52.740 --> 48:55.308
Besides, what else
are you going to do?

48:57.678 --> 48:59.679
I want my epidural.

48:59.747 --> 49:01.214
Something for the pain.

49:01.283 --> 49:04.351
Out!
She'll be fine.

49:13.861 --> 49:15.128
First child?

49:15.196 --> 49:17.864
Yeah. Yeah.

49:17.932 --> 49:20.267
Just kind of nervous.
You know how it is.

49:20.335 --> 49:21.702
Yeah, I was, too.

49:21.770 --> 49:24.205
What do you want,
a boy or a girl?

49:24.273 --> 49:28.242
Doesn't matter to me, man,
as long as my kid's healthy.

49:28.311 --> 49:29.844
That's all I want.

49:33.816 --> 49:36.384
Listen, I didn't mean
anything by that, man.

49:44.294 --> 49:47.963
Who was driving?
The car--who was driving?

49:48.031 --> 49:52.100
I was. What's that
got to do with anything?

49:52.168 --> 49:55.270
Why is your girl
all banged up and you're not?

49:57.474 --> 49:59.442
What do you call this?
Ha ha.

49:59.509 --> 50:01.510
What are you laughing at?

50:01.578 --> 50:03.446
Somebody get this fool
a band-aid.

50:03.513 --> 50:05.314
I don't want you
to bleed to death.

50:05.382 --> 50:09.319
Ha ha. Screw you, man.
That shit hurts.

50:09.387 --> 50:11.621
His air bag went off
and mine didn't.

50:11.689 --> 50:13.923
What kind of car
you drive?

50:13.991 --> 50:15.258
Mercedes 500.

50:15.326 --> 50:17.627
You drive a Mercedes 500?

50:17.695 --> 50:19.128
What year?

50:19.196 --> 50:22.198
1986. It's a classic.

50:22.266 --> 50:24.067
Mercedes didn't make

50:24.134 --> 50:27.303
passenger-side air bags
till 1988.

50:27.372 --> 50:30.775
Busted.

50:30.843 --> 50:32.042
What's your point,
John?

50:32.110 --> 50:33.944
What's yours, Mitch?

50:34.012 --> 50:35.646
You from
the slap-a-ho tribe.

50:35.714 --> 50:37.715
You like to beat
on that young lady,

50:37.783 --> 50:39.550
and everybody here
knows it.

50:44.222 --> 50:46.223
I was drunk, all right?

50:57.737 --> 50:58.970
Don't smoke in here.

50:59.038 --> 51:02.173
Give me a break.
Work with me here.

51:02.241 --> 51:03.709
I'm trying my best.

51:03.777 --> 51:06.011
Mr. Q, could I get
some water?

51:06.078 --> 51:08.213
And I need to tinkle.

51:08.281 --> 51:11.050
I got missed-meal cramps.

51:11.118 --> 51:13.986
I'm hungry. Let's get a bucket
of chicken or something.

51:14.054 --> 51:17.156
In a minute, okay?
How's it going in there?

51:17.224 --> 51:19.091
He's going to make it.

51:19.159 --> 51:21.628
You have any idea how much
blood this guy lost?

51:21.695 --> 51:24.831
It's incredible.
He saved this man's life.

51:38.212 --> 51:39.279
What's that?

51:39.347 --> 51:41.181
Lasix.
It's a diuretic

51:41.249 --> 51:43.717
to help get rid of some
of the fluid buildup.

51:43.785 --> 51:44.718
But it's
potassium-depleting,

51:44.786 --> 51:47.154
so he needs this one
to supplement.

51:48.122 --> 51:49.189
And those?

51:49.257 --> 51:51.091
Dopamine
for his blood pressure,

51:51.159 --> 51:53.293
dig for his heart,
primacor.

51:54.262 --> 51:56.982
Gosh, it seems
like so much.

51:57.050 --> 51:59.267
Yeah, it's a lot.
This is antibiotic.

51:59.335 --> 52:00.635
What for?

52:00.703 --> 52:03.404
It's prophylactic,
just in case.

52:06.442 --> 52:08.777
And those?
These two?

52:08.845 --> 52:10.979
They're for pain.

52:11.046 --> 52:13.448
I don't feel so good.

52:13.516 --> 52:15.450
This is going to
make you feel yucky

52:15.518 --> 52:17.987
for a few minutes, buddy,
but I'm going to get you

52:18.054 --> 52:20.656
some of those crunchy
ice chips that you want.

52:20.724 --> 52:22.057
How does that sound?

52:22.125 --> 52:23.459
Yeah.

52:23.527 --> 52:25.895
Hey, Mike, by the way,
there was this guy,

52:25.963 --> 52:27.797
he stopped by to see you.

52:27.865 --> 52:30.232
He said he was
a friend of yours.

52:30.300 --> 52:32.134
I got him right here.

52:32.202 --> 52:34.637
I didn't know if I should
let him in or not.

52:34.705 --> 52:36.005
What do you think?

52:36.072 --> 52:37.640
Yeah, he's okay.
He's okay?

52:37.708 --> 52:39.977
Said he wanted
to hang out with you.

52:40.044 --> 52:41.277
He's okay.

52:41.345 --> 52:42.445
That's great.

52:42.514 --> 52:44.648
Okay.

52:44.716 --> 52:46.316
Thank you.

53:01.767 --> 53:04.869
Oh, my baby!

53:04.937 --> 53:07.572
Let me hold my baby!

53:07.640 --> 53:10.708
Let me hold my baby!

53:10.776 --> 53:14.178
Mom? Is dad coming?

53:14.246 --> 53:17.081
Yeah, he's coming.

53:17.149 --> 53:21.118
When? Where is he?

53:22.221 --> 53:26.025
I don't know,
but he's coming.

53:35.802 --> 53:37.770
What are you up to?

53:37.837 --> 53:39.939
Never mind me.
You're worthless.

53:40.006 --> 53:41.941
You should have zapped
the bastard

53:42.008 --> 53:43.777
when you had the chance.

53:43.844 --> 53:46.646
With what? Besides, I'm not
sticking my neck on the line.

53:46.714 --> 53:49.950
Not for $8.50 an hour,
I'm not.

53:58.726 --> 54:00.493
Pay dirt.
Are you nuts?

54:00.561 --> 54:02.261
What the hell
are you doing?

54:02.329 --> 54:04.097
Looking out
for number one.

54:04.164 --> 54:06.100
You want to stay alive,
sit tight

54:06.167 --> 54:08.102
and wait for the cavalry
to get here.

54:08.169 --> 54:09.971
The cops
are coming in shooting.

54:10.038 --> 54:11.772
They don't care
about his kid.

54:11.840 --> 54:16.210
Once he realizes that,
we're all history.

54:16.277 --> 54:18.212
If he catches you
with that scalpel,

54:18.279 --> 54:20.214
you're the one
that's history, asshole.

54:20.281 --> 54:22.717
Really? He doesn't look
so bad to me.

54:22.784 --> 54:24.719
"Ethyl chloride."
Just like mace.

54:24.786 --> 54:27.789
Listen, put that stuff back
before you get us in trouble.

54:27.857 --> 54:29.791
No, you listen,
you stupid rent-a-cop.

54:29.859 --> 54:32.961
I am not a slob, all right?
I have a life.

54:33.029 --> 54:35.063
It means something to me.

54:35.131 --> 54:38.066
I'm not going down
in this shithole. No, sir.

54:39.769 --> 54:41.436
Back it up.

54:41.504 --> 54:43.105
Behind the barricade.

54:45.241 --> 54:46.675
Ho! Ho! Hey, hey.

54:46.743 --> 54:49.211
How are you?
How you all doing?

54:49.279 --> 54:51.614
Good, good. How are you?
How are you?

54:51.682 --> 54:53.182
Hey, how are you,
fellas?

54:53.250 --> 54:55.685
Is it true the man inside
wants an operation for his son?

54:55.753 --> 54:57.386
Hey, how you doing?
Everything good?

54:57.454 --> 54:58.888
Good to see you.

54:58.956 --> 55:01.457
Do you know
what kind of weapon he has?

55:01.525 --> 55:03.259
I'll let you know
when I know, okay?

55:03.326 --> 55:05.928
You'll be the first.
Okay?

55:05.996 --> 55:07.630
I'll let you know later.

55:07.698 --> 55:09.398
Gus.
How are you doing, Frank?

55:09.466 --> 55:11.168
It's hot.
Yeah, it is.

55:11.235 --> 55:13.503
A little early
for artillery, isn't it?

55:13.571 --> 55:15.505
Well, maybe.
Maybe not.

55:15.573 --> 55:17.507
You should tell me.
What's going on?

55:17.575 --> 55:19.977
You're looking at it.
A very upset father inside.

55:20.045 --> 55:23.413
We'll give him
a couple minutes to cool off.

55:27.318 --> 55:28.986
Let's not give him
too much time.

55:29.054 --> 55:31.689
Let's just end this
quick and quiet, okay?

55:31.757 --> 55:33.491
That's the plan.
Good.

55:33.559 --> 55:35.593
Good. In that case,
I'm just here

55:35.661 --> 55:37.796
to lend my support
in any way that I can.

55:37.863 --> 55:40.832
I don't need a babysitter
on this. It's under control.

55:40.900 --> 55:42.133
Is it?
Yes, it is.

55:42.201 --> 55:43.668
All right.
Can't have people

55:43.736 --> 55:46.705
running around the street
using guns, Frank.

55:46.772 --> 55:49.007
Makes it look
like the city's unsafe.

55:49.075 --> 55:51.009
Besides, I got to be here.

55:51.077 --> 55:52.510
Police chief
doesn't show up,

55:52.578 --> 55:54.346
looks like he's asleep
at the wheel.

55:54.414 --> 55:57.349
Just stay out of my way.
The TV cameras are over there.

55:57.417 --> 56:00.219
They should make you feel
right at home.

56:00.286 --> 56:02.888
Right. Why don't you
just relax?

56:02.956 --> 56:05.524
Why don't you
just relax?

56:05.592 --> 56:07.292
Why can't you relax?
I'm fine.

56:07.360 --> 56:09.228
Why don't you
just do your job?

56:09.295 --> 56:10.562
I'm doing my job.

56:10.630 --> 56:13.199
We're both cops, right?
We're on the same side.

56:13.266 --> 56:14.666
Right. Right.
Right?

56:14.735 --> 56:16.136
Okay.

56:16.204 --> 56:18.338
It's good to see you.
Thanks.

56:18.405 --> 56:21.141
Hello.
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

56:21.209 --> 56:23.043
I'll see you
in a little bit.

56:23.111 --> 56:26.179
No, we got it.
Okay, I got it.

56:26.247 --> 56:28.414
How are you? The old man,
looking for his depends.

56:28.482 --> 56:29.916
He leave them here?

56:41.797 --> 56:44.932
I don't understand why they
never found it, the doctors.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.334
My son has had
clean checkups every year

56:47.402 --> 56:48.736
since the day he was born.

56:48.804 --> 56:51.038
How could the doctors
not pick it up?

56:51.106 --> 56:53.074
He might not have been tested
thoroughly enough.

56:53.142 --> 56:54.208
Why not?

56:57.646 --> 56:59.181
You got an HMO, right?

56:59.249 --> 57:01.683
Yeah.
There's your answer.

57:01.751 --> 57:04.887
HMOs pay their doctors
not to test.

57:04.954 --> 57:07.022
It's their way
of keeping costs down.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.024
Say Mike did need
additional testing

57:09.092 --> 57:11.059
and insurance says
they won't cover them.

57:11.127 --> 57:13.495
The doctor keeps his mouth
shut, and come Christmas,

57:13.562 --> 57:17.399
the hmo sends the doctor
a fat-ass bonus check.

57:17.466 --> 57:19.868
Is that true?
Possible.

57:19.936 --> 57:22.272
Not likely,
but possible.

57:22.339 --> 57:25.041
These doctors may have known
what was wrong with my son,

57:25.109 --> 57:27.376
and they could have
treated him all along?

57:27.444 --> 57:29.212
Who knows?
I don't know, John.

57:29.280 --> 57:32.115
Don't take this
personal, doc.

57:32.183 --> 57:33.549
You're a bunch of crooks.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.551
You don't know
what you're talking about.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.553
What about
that thing you take?

57:37.621 --> 57:39.755
The thing?
That promise.

57:39.824 --> 57:41.825
It's called
the hippocratic oath.

57:41.892 --> 57:43.593
More like
the hypocritical oath.

57:43.661 --> 57:45.529
How's it go, doc?

57:45.596 --> 57:49.033
"I solemnly swear to take care
of the sick and damn-near-dying,

57:49.100 --> 57:50.968
unless they ain't got
major medical."

57:51.036 --> 57:52.203
Something like that?

57:52.270 --> 57:53.470
You've got it perfectly.

57:53.538 --> 57:55.940
It's funny, but it's
not far from the truth.

57:56.007 --> 57:57.774
This shit happens
all the time.

57:57.843 --> 57:59.776
Paramedics bring in
some accident victim.

57:59.845 --> 58:02.079
When the boys in accounting
find out they can't pay,

58:02.147 --> 58:03.447
they send them packing.

58:03.514 --> 58:05.283
Hospitals can't
turn people away.

58:05.351 --> 58:07.018
Isn't there laws
against that?

58:07.086 --> 58:08.686
There's also ways
around those laws.

58:08.754 --> 58:12.423
We have to stabilize them.
After that, we're off the hook.

58:12.491 --> 58:13.658
That's not how it works.

58:13.726 --> 58:15.293
That's exactly
how it works.

58:15.361 --> 58:17.128
Maybe not
on the fifth floor,

58:17.196 --> 58:18.830
but in here
if you don't have money,

58:18.898 --> 58:20.665
you get a band-aid,
a foot in the ass,

58:20.733 --> 58:21.967
and you're out the door.

58:22.034 --> 58:24.469
Enough already. I've heard
all the bitching and moaning

58:24.536 --> 58:26.272
I can stand for one day.

58:26.340 --> 58:28.207
Look, if you all
want to regard me

58:28.275 --> 58:30.442
as some kind of blood-sucking
vampire, then fine.

58:30.510 --> 58:32.411
I'll be the bad guy.

58:32.479 --> 58:34.947
But who's holding
the fucking gun?

58:42.822 --> 58:45.791
Sir? Lieutenant!

58:48.229 --> 58:49.396
Hello?

58:49.463 --> 58:50.463
Hello.

58:50.531 --> 58:52.632
John,
this is Frank Grimes.

58:52.700 --> 58:54.034
The line is clipped.

58:54.102 --> 58:56.669
You pick up the phone,
you get me, okay?

58:56.737 --> 58:58.838
Now, what can I do
for you?

58:58.907 --> 59:00.807
What's going on
with the list?

59:00.875 --> 59:03.010
I'm working on it,
but I need some time.

59:03.077 --> 59:04.544
Time I don't have, Frank.

59:04.612 --> 59:06.046
Let's talk
about the hostages.

59:06.114 --> 59:08.548
Let's talk about them.
What do you want to know?

59:08.616 --> 59:10.584
What's going on in there?
How are they?

59:10.652 --> 59:12.520
They're fine.
They're full.

59:12.587 --> 59:14.555
We're eating candy bars
and discussing HMOs.

59:14.623 --> 59:16.524
We're sitting here
waiting for you.

59:16.591 --> 59:18.526
I want you
to let some of them go.

59:18.593 --> 59:19.760
For what?

59:19.828 --> 59:22.463
I do for you, you do for me.
Show some good faith.

59:22.531 --> 59:24.532
A lot of nervous people
out here, John.

59:24.599 --> 59:26.367
Make everybody breathe
a lot easier

59:26.435 --> 59:28.169
if we saw some happy faces.

59:28.237 --> 59:30.371
I'll do for you
when you start doing for me.

59:30.439 --> 59:31.773
Lieutenant!

59:31.841 --> 59:34.576
...kid's name on that list.
I'm not kidding around.

59:34.644 --> 59:35.978
Good faith.

59:36.046 --> 59:37.579
<i>Good faith
only takes you so far...</i>

59:37.647 --> 59:38.948
What's the name?

59:39.015 --> 59:42.017
...merit system. So far,
you haven't earned any points.

59:42.085 --> 59:43.752
I need to talk to you.

59:43.820 --> 59:46.055
This woman
is six centimeters dilated.

59:46.122 --> 59:48.023
The baby is breeched.
I've medicated her,

59:48.091 --> 59:50.525
but we have to move her
to maternity immediately.

59:50.593 --> 59:51.526
John?

59:51.594 --> 59:52.528
Hang on, Frank.

59:52.596 --> 59:53.863
Right down here.

59:55.466 --> 59:56.866
What the hell
is going on?

59:56.934 --> 59:58.201
Do you know this man?

01:00:01.372 --> 01:00:03.573
John Archibald.
He has a son here in ICU.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.575
Put people on the door.
Find the mother.

01:00:05.642 --> 01:00:07.077
I need to talk to her.

01:00:07.144 --> 01:00:08.311
Are you there,
Frank?

01:00:08.379 --> 01:00:10.046
I'm here, John.
I'm here.

01:00:10.114 --> 01:00:12.115
I changed my mind,
all right?

01:00:12.183 --> 01:00:14.452
I'm going to let
some of the hostages go.

01:00:14.519 --> 01:00:15.652
That's the right thing.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.556
But when I do, the clock starts,
you understand?

01:00:19.624 --> 01:00:22.593
It's 4:15.
You got one hour.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.329
You got till 5:15,
you understand, Frank?

01:00:25.397 --> 01:00:27.999
If my boy's
not on that list by 5:15,

01:00:28.066 --> 01:00:29.166
somebody in here
is going to die.

01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:30.667
Don't be stupid.

01:00:30.735 --> 01:00:34.738
5:15, Frank. 5-1-5,
something happens for me!

01:00:34.806 --> 01:00:36.074
Got it.

01:00:36.142 --> 01:00:39.544
You're a cop.
Call the coroner.

01:00:39.612 --> 01:00:43.415
This is bad, Frank.
This has just got to go away.

01:00:46.219 --> 01:00:48.520
All right, Miriam...

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:52.658
And rosa.

01:00:52.725 --> 01:00:54.726
<i>Yes?
Vamos. Let's go.</i>

01:00:54.794 --> 01:00:56.695
Mr. Archibald,

01:00:56.763 --> 01:00:58.898
please let my husband
come with me.

01:00:58.965 --> 01:01:01.668
I need you to get out of here.
I will be okay. Just go.

01:01:01.735 --> 01:01:03.770
Shit, I'll go.
I'm free.

01:01:03.837 --> 01:01:05.271
Steve, baby,
no, please.

01:01:05.339 --> 01:01:06.806
What kind of man are you?

01:01:06.873 --> 01:01:08.441
Screw you, Tyrone.

01:01:08.509 --> 01:01:10.443
What? Screw me, Tyrone?

01:01:10.511 --> 01:01:11.877
<i>Wait a second.
Screw me?</i>

01:01:11.945 --> 01:01:14.046
Wait a minute, all right?
Just relax.

01:01:14.114 --> 01:01:15.748
Aah!

01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:20.788
Yeah, that's right,
tough guy.

01:01:26.093 --> 01:01:29.129
Julie, baby,
get the gun! Come on!

01:01:29.197 --> 01:01:31.231
Go over there
and pick up that gun.

01:01:31.299 --> 01:01:34.034
Shoot him! Shoot him
right in the face, Julie!

01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:35.502
Right in the face!

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:39.172
Get up! Get the gun!
There you go, baby.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.244
What are you--are you crazy?
What are you doing?

01:01:43.312 --> 01:01:45.179
Come on now! Aah!

01:01:47.249 --> 01:01:49.183
Max, you got cuffs?
Yeah.

01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:51.185
Oh, God!

01:01:54.223 --> 01:01:57.024
You stupid bitch!

01:01:57.092 --> 01:01:59.761
That's for beating
the shit out of me!

01:02:01.864 --> 01:02:04.834
And that's
for being an asshole!

01:02:07.136 --> 01:02:09.938
Heh heh ha ha.

01:02:10.006 --> 01:02:13.743
And this, this is
for calling me a bitch!

01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:15.344
Ohh!

01:02:15.412 --> 01:02:16.879
I felt that one.

01:02:18.382 --> 01:02:21.617
And I'm not going to be
your Barbie anymore!

01:02:21.685 --> 01:02:26.523
Goddamn! All that ass
and muscles to go with it.

01:02:26.591 --> 01:02:28.625
I knew damn well
you wasn't no blonde.

01:02:28.693 --> 01:02:30.059
Give them to me.

01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:33.463
Mitch!
Look at me!

01:02:39.003 --> 01:02:40.336
Come here.

01:02:52.117 --> 01:02:54.218
Let's go, both of you.

01:02:55.554 --> 01:02:56.687
Whatever happens,

01:02:56.755 --> 01:02:59.690
I want you to know
everything's going to be okay.

01:02:59.758 --> 01:03:01.659
You understand me?
Yes.

01:03:01.727 --> 01:03:05.996
Don't worry. Don't worry
about anything.

01:03:06.064 --> 01:03:08.600
I'll always be there
for you, baby.

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:13.071
Don't shoot!

01:03:17.076 --> 01:03:20.612
I'm letting some hostages go!
Don't shoot!

01:03:22.081 --> 01:03:25.717
All right, Steve. You, too.
Let's go, both of you.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.054
Thank you. Thank you.

01:03:29.121 --> 01:03:30.857
<i>Muchas gracias, señor.</i>

01:03:30.925 --> 01:03:32.124
Thank you,
Mr. Archibald.

01:03:32.192 --> 01:03:34.794
That's right.
You, too.

01:03:34.862 --> 01:03:36.429
Take care of his ear.

01:03:36.497 --> 01:03:39.298
<i>The gunman
has just freed several hostage,</i>

01:03:39.366 --> 01:03:41.133
<i>who will immediately
be debriefed</i>

01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:42.969
<i>by members
of the crisis team.</i>

01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:46.439
<i>Will the man known as John Q
get a heart for his little boy?</i>

01:03:46.507 --> 01:03:48.007
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:50.577
<i>From Hope Memorial hospital,
I'm Tuck Lampley.</i>

01:03:50.644 --> 01:03:52.780
Is it true an ambulance
dropped off a gunshot victim

01:03:52.848 --> 01:03:54.615
after the gunman took over?

01:03:54.683 --> 01:03:57.384
He unlocked the door
and he let him inside!

01:03:57.452 --> 01:03:58.619
Can you comment?

01:03:58.687 --> 01:04:00.220
The man
was critically injured.

01:04:00.288 --> 01:04:02.456
If he hadn't let him in,
he would have died.

01:04:02.524 --> 01:04:04.124
Ma'am, are you all right?

01:04:04.192 --> 01:04:07.561
Oh, yeah, I feel good.
We're having a baby!

01:04:07.629 --> 01:04:09.997
Ma'am, any comments
about the gunman?

01:04:10.064 --> 01:04:11.799
John Q very good man.

01:04:11.867 --> 01:04:13.334
The gunman?

01:04:13.402 --> 01:04:14.536
Very good man!

01:04:25.247 --> 01:04:27.949
They got a camera.
They're watching a video feed.

01:04:28.017 --> 01:04:29.283
How do you know?

01:04:29.351 --> 01:04:32.353
<i>They're looking at something.
Can you get it?</i>

01:04:32.421 --> 01:04:35.057
Boss, if they got it,
I can get it.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.059
You give in,
there's going to be guns

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:38.828
in every hospital
in the country.

01:04:38.896 --> 01:04:41.363
You think Archibald's the only
one who has a sick child?

01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:44.366
Have you checked the HIV ward?
There's a whole floor full.

01:04:44.434 --> 01:04:47.469
People get sick. They die.
That's the way it goes.

01:04:47.538 --> 01:04:49.872
I'm faced with
decisions like this every day.

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.742
There's a man threatening
to kill innocent people

01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:55.344
because you refused
to help his son.

01:04:55.412 --> 01:04:57.280
There are 50 million people
in this country

01:04:57.348 --> 01:04:58.849
without medical insurance.

01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:01.885
If you'd like to change it,
call your congressman.

01:05:01.953 --> 01:05:04.254
Excuse me.
Why don't we just tell him

01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:06.389
his son's name
is on the list?

01:05:06.457 --> 01:05:11.061
Doesn't that make sense?
How's he going to know, anyway?

01:05:12.797 --> 01:05:13.864
Sir? Pardon me.

01:05:13.932 --> 01:05:15.999
Can you come
take a look at this?

01:05:19.972 --> 01:05:21.205
Sarge, chief Monroe,

01:05:21.273 --> 01:05:23.374
this is Wally pitoniak,
head of security.

01:05:23.442 --> 01:05:26.243
Nice to meet you.
I got your spot.

01:05:26.311 --> 01:05:30.548
Here's your sight.
That's going to be your perch.

01:05:30.616 --> 01:05:33.051
The x there,
that's your phone.

01:05:34.186 --> 01:05:35.186
Which phone?

01:05:35.253 --> 01:05:36.654
Bring it up, Jeff.

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:41.259
The phone right there.

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:46.198
<i>It is, Tom,
but Chief Monroe maintains</i>

01:05:46.265 --> 01:05:48.333
<i>the police will do
whatever is necessary</i>

01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:51.203
<i>to preserve the lives
and safety of these hostages.</i>

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.005
<i>Thanks.
This country.</i>

01:05:53.073 --> 01:05:55.641
Can't go anywhere anymore
without getting mugged

01:05:55.709 --> 01:05:58.276
or murdered or stabbed.

01:05:58.344 --> 01:06:01.146
Kids killing
their classmates, drive-bys.

01:06:01.214 --> 01:06:04.250
I won't even go into
a post office anymore.

01:06:04.318 --> 01:06:06.185
Shut up, Mitch.
You shut up.

01:06:06.253 --> 01:06:08.187
I hate the little bastard,
but he's right.

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:10.189
You know how easy it is
to get a gun?

01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:11.925
Five minutes.
Gun show. Boom.

01:06:11.993 --> 01:06:13.994
I understand
your kid is sick, John,

01:06:14.061 --> 01:06:15.629
but what makes him
better than me?

01:06:15.696 --> 01:06:16.997
I got a life, too.

01:06:17.064 --> 01:06:18.331
But you got insurance.

01:06:18.398 --> 01:06:20.100
So what, are you
going to shoot me?

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:21.768
That's what
you're telling the cops.

01:06:21.836 --> 01:06:24.739
If your son doesn't get
the very first heart available,

01:06:24.806 --> 01:06:26.206
we all die.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:31.979
How's it going to end, John?
What's your move?

01:06:32.047 --> 01:06:33.648
I got no moves, okay?

01:06:33.715 --> 01:06:37.084
I don't know
what I'm going to do. I'm...

01:06:38.654 --> 01:06:40.955
I'm waiting
on a miracle, okay?

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.291
I'm waiting
on an act of God.

01:07:09.119 --> 01:07:10.787
Mrs. Archibald?

01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:14.290
Could we have a word
with you, please?

01:07:16.794 --> 01:07:18.627
This is all my fault.

01:07:18.696 --> 01:07:21.530
When the hospital told me
they were releasing Mikey,

01:07:21.598 --> 01:07:23.499
I called John,
and I yelled at him

01:07:23.567 --> 01:07:25.434
and told him
to do something, anything.

01:07:25.502 --> 01:07:28.604
But I never thought--

01:07:28.672 --> 01:07:32.142
I understand. Is he
a violent man, Mrs. Archibald?

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.711
No!

01:07:33.778 --> 01:07:36.980
No, he's sweet and gentle.

01:07:37.048 --> 01:07:38.749
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

01:07:38.817 --> 01:07:40.283
That's not what he's saying.

01:07:40.351 --> 01:07:42.285
He's talking
about killing people.

01:07:42.353 --> 01:07:45.789
Now, I may be fishing here,
but has he spent any time

01:07:45.857 --> 01:07:48.726
in the military
or anything like that?

01:07:50.629 --> 01:07:53.198
What is this?
What?

01:07:53.265 --> 01:07:57.401
Oh, I see
what's going on here.

01:07:57.469 --> 01:07:59.537
You're trying to get me
to say something

01:07:59.605 --> 01:08:01.672
that you can use
against my husband.

01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:03.474
He's in a lot of trouble.

01:08:03.542 --> 01:08:05.476
We're going to need you
to talk to him.

01:08:05.544 --> 01:08:08.246
Let's get
something straight, mister.

01:08:08.313 --> 01:08:11.649
You cannot use me to build
a case against my husband.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:14.086
I support him
in everything that he does.

01:08:14.154 --> 01:08:16.287
I'm on his side,
not yours.

01:08:16.356 --> 01:08:17.522
Mrs. Archibald--

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:19.091
and you
don't talk to me!

01:08:21.426 --> 01:08:24.462
I would tell you
what I think of you...

01:08:25.866 --> 01:08:27.832
...but I'm a Christian woman.

01:08:29.569 --> 01:08:31.502
Now you two
leave me alone.

01:08:31.571 --> 01:08:33.906
I have a sick child
to look after.

01:08:38.045 --> 01:08:40.046
I've decided
to put Michael's name

01:08:40.113 --> 01:08:42.849
on the recipient list.

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:45.185
The hospital will pay
for everything.

01:08:47.388 --> 01:08:49.256
Really?

01:08:49.323 --> 01:08:51.057
Really.

01:08:52.059 --> 01:08:54.261
Thank you.

01:08:54.328 --> 01:08:56.964
Oh, God, thank you.

01:09:04.538 --> 01:09:06.006
You're good.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.109
Excuse me?

01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:09.310
Quite the performance.

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:10.812
What are you
talking about?

01:09:10.879 --> 01:09:12.313
Comforting embrace,
sincere look.

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:15.183
For a minute, I actually
believed you cared.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:30.365
<i>We go now
to hope memorial hospital,</i>

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:32.234
<i>live--Tuck Lampley.</i>

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:33.734
As you can see,

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:35.804
the crowd in front
of hope memorial is growing.

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:39.341
The S.W.A.T. Team has arrived.
The situation is becoming tense.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.477
Standing next to me
is James Palumbo,

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:43.212
friend of John Archibald.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.348
Mr. Palumbo,
what can you tell us

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:46.682
about John Archibald?

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:51.287
You know, um,
I got to be honest, Tuck.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:56.659
I mean, this whole thing, uh,
sucks, you know?

01:09:56.727 --> 01:09:59.562
It all could have been avoided
so incredibly easy.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:01.165
I mean, uh,

01:10:01.233 --> 01:10:04.101
<i>none of this had to happen
if John had been a millionaire</i>

01:10:04.169 --> 01:10:05.970
<i>or if his last name
was Rockefeller,</i>

01:10:06.037 --> 01:10:07.671
<i>but sometimes
John don't get it.</i>

01:10:07.739 --> 01:10:09.373
<i>He don't understand</i>

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.343
<i>that what we hold sacred
in this country isn't values.</i>

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:15.913
<i>It's value that's important.
We got haves, we got have-nots.</i>

01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:19.549
<i>We've got white collar,
blue collar, and no collar.</i>

01:10:19.617 --> 01:10:22.253
<i>Inside there we got surgery,</i>

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.324
<i>outpatient surgery,
out-of-luck surgery.</i>

01:10:26.392 --> 01:10:28.693
<i>There's a lot of people
out there</i>

01:10:28.761 --> 01:10:31.363
<i>who don't got 250 grand
in their billfold.</i>

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:33.564
<i>To shame a man like that</i>

01:10:33.632 --> 01:10:35.566
<i>and back him into a corner...</i>

01:10:35.634 --> 01:10:39.237
<i>Seems to me that something is
out of whack, not someone.</i>

01:10:39.305 --> 01:10:43.108
<i>But, hey, what do I know?
I'm--I'm a factory worker.</i>

01:10:43.175 --> 01:10:45.811
<i>Well, I can see this is
making you very upset,</i>

01:10:45.879 --> 01:10:48.480
<i>but if you could speak
to John Q right now,</i>

01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:50.983
<i>what would you say to him?</i>

01:10:51.051 --> 01:10:54.453
<i>I'm there with you,
and you take care.</i>

01:10:54.521 --> 01:10:55.988
<i>That's one man's opinion.</i>

01:10:56.056 --> 01:10:58.257
<i>Live at the crisis
at Hope Memorial,</i>

01:10:58.325 --> 01:10:59.658
<i>this is Tuck Lampley.</i>

01:11:31.126 --> 01:11:33.527
What's going on?
Where's everybody?

01:11:33.595 --> 01:11:36.664
We're sending one of our guys
in through the air duct.

01:11:36.731 --> 01:11:39.667
Now, if we can get the target
to this phone,

01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:41.269
we got a clear shot.

01:11:41.337 --> 01:11:42.503
Is that right?

01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:44.339
Yes, Lieutenant,
that is right.

01:11:44.406 --> 01:11:46.341
When you're ready, chief.

01:11:58.254 --> 01:12:00.022
Gus!

01:12:01.424 --> 01:12:02.624
My wife's calling.

01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:04.726
Worse, chief.
It's father time.

01:12:04.794 --> 01:12:06.628
Come over here!

01:12:06.696 --> 01:12:10.132
Not one word, Frank.
I don't want to hear it.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.369
You son of a bitch,
you're going behind my back!

01:12:12.436 --> 01:12:13.870
What do you want?

01:12:13.937 --> 01:12:15.872
Look at the clock!
Look at your watch!

01:12:15.939 --> 01:12:17.374
At a quarter after,

01:12:17.441 --> 01:12:19.342
he's going to start
killing people...

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.977
This is
so goddamned stupid!

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.812
Oh, really?
What's your great idea?

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.349
There are no great ideas,
especially this!

01:12:26.417 --> 01:12:29.085
I got a shot at this guy.
I'm going to take it.

01:12:29.153 --> 01:12:31.621
You know the drill.
Always take the open shot.

01:12:31.688 --> 01:12:33.624
The wife has agreed
to speak to him.

01:12:33.691 --> 01:12:35.059
Let her talk him down.

01:12:35.127 --> 01:12:36.860
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

01:12:36.928 --> 01:12:39.230
You used the wife
to set him up?

01:12:39.297 --> 01:12:41.065
I'm going to use
whatever works.

01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:43.034
Let me paint
a picture for you.

01:12:43.101 --> 01:12:44.735
We have a lose/lose.

01:12:44.802 --> 01:12:47.304
This guy starts whacking
hostages, that's bad.

01:12:47.372 --> 01:12:50.007
If we give into this asshole,
it's also bad.

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:52.176
Bad for who?
Everybody.

01:12:52.244 --> 01:12:54.412
Me, you, everybody.
It's an election year.

01:12:54.479 --> 01:12:56.114
However it goes down,

01:12:56.182 --> 01:12:58.316
this guy's
not going to make it.

01:12:58.384 --> 01:13:00.519
So you kill him,
that's a P.R. Bonanza?

01:13:00.586 --> 01:13:02.454
I can live
with one dead bad guy.

01:13:02.522 --> 01:13:05.290
What I can't live with is one
innocent person being hurt,

01:13:05.358 --> 01:13:07.659
not one, not on my watch.

01:13:09.028 --> 01:13:11.530
You know what, Frank?
You're out.

01:13:11.597 --> 01:13:12.931
<i>I'm out?</i>

01:13:12.998 --> 01:13:14.966
You're officially
relieved of duty.

01:13:15.034 --> 01:13:16.869
I'm going to
handle this now.

01:13:16.937 --> 01:13:18.371
You?
Yeah, me.

01:13:18.439 --> 01:13:20.873
You think it's my first time
around the dance floor?

01:13:20.941 --> 01:13:23.776
How do you think I got these?
And watch it.

01:13:23.843 --> 01:13:26.779
I got a lot of pressure on me.
There's a lot of eyes watching.

01:13:26.846 --> 01:13:28.781
Someone's got to make
the call.

01:13:28.848 --> 01:13:30.816
You're not
going to do it, are you?

01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:33.086
<i>I'll do it.</i>

01:13:33.153 --> 01:13:35.654
What about the hostages,
the human beings?

01:13:35.722 --> 01:13:37.823
Better keep
their heads down.

01:13:49.137 --> 01:13:51.505
Great.
What is it?

01:13:51.573 --> 01:13:53.707
The air conditioning
just turned off.

01:13:59.747 --> 01:14:01.816
I'm counting on you.
Don't let me down, okay?

01:14:01.883 --> 01:14:03.251
I'll call you!

01:14:03.319 --> 01:14:05.620
Right on.
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:14:05.687 --> 01:14:08.289
Don't touch me! Excuse me.
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:14:08.357 --> 01:14:10.592
Tuck Lampley, channel 8?
Right. You got it.

01:14:10.659 --> 01:14:13.761
Thanks, officer!
Excuse me. Whoo!

01:14:14.763 --> 01:14:16.631
Where's my picture?

01:14:16.698 --> 01:14:19.334
I just got to unscramble
the police encryption.

01:14:19.401 --> 01:14:21.336
Hurry. I got a contact
in cardiology.

01:14:21.403 --> 01:14:23.439
The cops are going to
set up a call

01:14:23.507 --> 01:14:25.441
between this guy
and his wife.

01:14:29.513 --> 01:14:30.613
Are you with the wife?

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.814
All right,
let's patch it through.

01:14:43.577 --> 01:14:45.545
Hello.

01:14:45.612 --> 01:14:47.647
Hello.

01:15:04.432 --> 01:15:06.200
This better be good,
Frank.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:08.202
John?

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.637
John?

01:15:10.705 --> 01:15:11.973
Denise?

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.507
God, baby.

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.343
Yeah.

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:16.844
We're on the list.

01:15:16.911 --> 01:15:18.079
What?

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:21.648
Payne just left here.
Mikey's name is on the list.

01:15:21.716 --> 01:15:23.351
Baby, you did it.

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:26.020
What? We're on the list?

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.889
Okay. Wow.

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:29.791
Ha ha ha ha.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:33.761
Oh, wow.
This is great, baby.

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.932
We're--yeah!

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:43.105
Oh, we got sound.

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.739
Good, but where's
the video?

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:46.274
I need picture.

01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:48.443
Hang on. I'm going to
make you really famous.

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:52.015
<i>Wow, I'm just--
I'm, uh...</i>

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:57.220
That's great, baby.
How's Mikey doing?

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.793
Not too good.

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:07.430
I think
he's going away.

01:16:07.498 --> 01:16:08.498
What?

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:09.732
Yeah.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:13.037
They've done everything
they can for him,

01:16:13.104 --> 01:16:16.407
but he keeps getting
worse and worse.

01:16:17.675 --> 01:16:21.045
Oh, God.

01:16:21.112 --> 01:16:23.347
Our poor baby.

01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:36.627
Are you praying for him, John?
Are you praying for our baby?

01:16:36.695 --> 01:16:39.397
Yes, I'm praying, sweetheart.
You know I am.

01:16:39.465 --> 01:16:42.500
Checkmate. This is
the white rook. Copy.

01:16:42.568 --> 01:16:43.935
I copy, white rook.

01:16:44.002 --> 01:16:45.937
It's going
to be all right, sweetheart.

01:16:46.004 --> 01:16:47.338
Listen to me.

01:16:47.406 --> 01:16:49.174
He's going to make it.

01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:51.976
I swear on my life,
he's going to make it.

01:16:52.044 --> 01:16:53.511
You understand me?

01:16:54.714 --> 01:16:56.148
Okay.

01:16:56.216 --> 01:16:59.618
You just got to believe me,
you understand?

01:16:59.686 --> 01:17:01.987
I believe.

01:17:02.055 --> 01:17:05.491
Is he awake? Is Mikey awake?
Can I talk to him?

01:17:05.559 --> 01:17:07.826
Hold on.

01:17:18.106 --> 01:17:19.306
Oh, my God.

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:22.809
We got it! Boss!
The video's online.

01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:24.877
You are a genius.
You are beautiful.

01:17:24.945 --> 01:17:26.713
What are you doing
standing around?

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.548
Move your ass!
This is it!

01:17:28.616 --> 01:17:31.418
Thank you.
Freddy, I swear to God--

01:17:31.486 --> 01:17:33.886
Nigel, you're moving
like lava. Hustle.

01:17:33.954 --> 01:17:36.223
How's my hair?
Never mind. Let's get this.

01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:38.326
And three, two, one.

01:17:38.393 --> 01:17:40.961
This is Tuck Lampley,
live at Hope Memorial hospital,

01:17:41.029 --> 01:17:44.031
bringing you exclusive coverage
between a father and his son

01:17:44.099 --> 01:17:46.167
he's fighting
most desperately to save.

01:17:47.869 --> 01:17:49.604
Honey?

01:17:49.671 --> 01:17:51.972
It's your dad.
He's on the phone.

01:17:56.178 --> 01:17:57.845
Hello?

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:01.617
Champ.

01:18:03.819 --> 01:18:05.521
How's my boy, huh?

01:18:05.588 --> 01:18:07.523
You hanging in there?

01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:09.724
Uh-huh.

01:18:09.792 --> 01:18:11.226
How are you?

01:18:11.294 --> 01:18:13.295
Oh, I'm--
what do you mean, how am I?

01:18:13.363 --> 01:18:15.230
I'm good.
I'm--I'm--I'm--

01:18:15.298 --> 01:18:17.199
don't worry about me.
I'm good.

01:18:24.909 --> 01:18:27.143
How come
you're not here, dad?

01:18:32.449 --> 01:18:34.450
Well, I'm, uh...

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:39.122
<i>I'm tied up, Mikey.
I can't get away now.</i>

01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:43.593
<i>But I'm close,
real close to you.</i>

01:18:43.661 --> 01:18:46.563
Mom says
I need a new heart.

01:18:46.631 --> 01:18:49.166
Yeah, that's right,
champ. You do.

01:18:50.335 --> 01:18:53.537
But what's wrong
with my heart?

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:55.572
There's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.174
It's just that you...

01:19:00.312 --> 01:19:02.213
You just need a--

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.382
they're going to--
you need a strong--

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:07.886
you got to get a better heart
to be stronger, that's all.

01:19:07.954 --> 01:19:09.721
They're giving you a new one

01:19:09.788 --> 01:19:12.657
that's going to make you
real strong.

01:19:12.725 --> 01:19:13.892
Okay.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.493
Okay?

01:19:21.367 --> 01:19:23.434
Hey, dad?

01:19:23.502 --> 01:19:24.936
Yeah?

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.540
Am I going to die?

01:19:29.843 --> 01:19:32.578
No, you're not going to die.
Of course not.

01:19:34.447 --> 01:19:36.115
How do you know?

01:19:36.183 --> 01:19:39.785
Hey, what--what good would
the world be without you?

01:19:39.853 --> 01:19:41.153
Oh, my God.

01:19:41.221 --> 01:19:43.189
This is the greatest thing
I've ever seen.

01:19:43.257 --> 01:19:45.758
<i>Without you
there is no world.</i>

01:19:45.825 --> 01:19:47.626
This is my White Bronco.

01:19:47.694 --> 01:19:48.996
Hey, Mike.

01:19:49.063 --> 01:19:50.297
Yeah?

01:19:50.365 --> 01:19:51.498
Listen to me.

01:19:51.565 --> 01:19:53.633
On your command.

01:19:53.701 --> 01:19:55.735
You know I love you,
don't you?

01:19:55.803 --> 01:19:58.138
You know how proud
I am of you?

01:19:58.206 --> 01:19:59.773
Yeah.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.110
Yeah, I just wanted
to make sure you know that.

01:20:03.177 --> 01:20:06.346
<i>I just wanted to tell you that
in case I forgot.</i>

01:20:08.716 --> 01:20:09.784
Take the shot.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:13.054
It's not clear.

01:20:14.023 --> 01:20:15.823
Holding.

01:20:18.127 --> 01:20:21.595
Hey, why don't you give me
one of those Chris Cormeirs?

01:20:21.663 --> 01:20:23.331
Yeah.

01:20:23.399 --> 01:20:24.933
Oh, yeah.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.670
Chris Cormeir.
He's great.

01:20:29.738 --> 01:20:32.574
He's great
and so are you, baby.

01:20:36.579 --> 01:20:38.880
I love you, dad.

01:20:41.217 --> 01:20:42.784
Okay, son.

01:20:44.754 --> 01:20:46.989
I'll talk
to you later, okay?

01:20:47.057 --> 01:20:49.024
<i>With all my heart, son,
I love you.</i>

01:20:49.092 --> 01:20:50.859
<i>I love you, too, dad.</i>

01:20:50.927 --> 01:20:52.794
Oh, shit!

01:20:53.797 --> 01:20:54.864
John!

01:20:54.932 --> 01:20:56.666
You're on TV, man.

01:20:56.733 --> 01:20:59.135
Channel 8.

01:21:11.048 --> 01:21:13.049
Somebody help me!

01:21:30.869 --> 01:21:33.004
He's down. We got him.

01:21:33.071 --> 01:21:34.638
He's down.

01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:45.984
He's not down.

01:21:56.462 --> 01:21:57.896
Goddamn it!

01:21:57.963 --> 01:21:59.399
Command.

01:21:59.466 --> 01:22:00.766
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:02.402
This is very bad, Gus.

01:22:02.469 --> 01:22:03.736
Sir?
Not now.

01:22:03.803 --> 01:22:06.239
No, it's the mayor, sir.
We better kill this video feed.

01:22:06.306 --> 01:22:08.074
The press
hacked into our signal.

01:22:08.142 --> 01:22:11.144
This whole thing went out live
over national television.

01:22:32.833 --> 01:22:34.518
Mikey's not
going to make it.

01:22:34.586 --> 01:22:35.953
What about the list?

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:38.689
What list? They're shooting
at me, shooting at us.

01:22:38.756 --> 01:22:41.024
They're not
going to help my son.

01:22:41.092 --> 01:22:44.095
The sniper gained access to
the hospital through the venti--

01:22:44.162 --> 01:22:45.697
you gonna bust me?
Out.

01:22:45.764 --> 01:22:48.833
You just shot an innocent man
on prime-time TV.

01:23:08.888 --> 01:23:10.655
We want
to see John!

01:23:14.227 --> 01:23:16.128
Where's grimes?

01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:19.264
Hang in there, man!

01:23:19.332 --> 01:23:22.067
Where's Lieutenant Grimes?

01:23:22.135 --> 01:23:25.405
All right.
All right what?

01:23:25.473 --> 01:23:27.440
All right, let's go see
what he wants.

01:23:27.508 --> 01:23:29.042
You've got to be kidding.

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:31.044
Don't start breaking my balls.
I screwed up.

01:23:31.112 --> 01:23:32.979
I need you
to save my ass.

01:23:33.047 --> 01:23:34.947
I really stepped in shit.
Please, Frank.

01:23:35.016 --> 01:23:37.950
Come on,
I'll buy you a steak.

01:23:39.786 --> 01:23:41.654
Peking duck.
Peking duck.

01:23:41.722 --> 01:23:43.490
Yeah. Let's go.
You got it.

01:23:43.557 --> 01:23:47.028
A-R-C-H-I-B-A-L-D.

01:23:47.095 --> 01:23:50.731
Yeah, yeah, I'm faxing you
all the stuff right now.

01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:01.742
Come over here.
On this side.

01:24:03.278 --> 01:24:04.645
Hold your fire!

01:24:04.712 --> 01:24:06.547
Don't fire.
Turn them down.

01:24:06.614 --> 01:24:08.049
There's a lot
of cameras.

01:24:08.116 --> 01:24:10.052
I don't want anybody
doing anything.

01:24:11.487 --> 01:24:13.422
Who's that with you?

01:24:13.489 --> 01:24:16.324
Sergeant...
Moody!

01:24:16.392 --> 01:24:18.760
Police Chief Monroe.

01:24:18.827 --> 01:24:22.364
What's going on
here, John?

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.901
He's got no pants on!

01:24:34.578 --> 01:24:36.312
You lied to me,
Lieutenant.

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.014
You said you were going to
call me back, but you didn't.

01:24:39.083 --> 01:24:40.516
I gave you your hostages,

01:24:40.584 --> 01:24:43.018
but you didn't
call me back. Why?

01:24:43.087 --> 01:24:44.687
Because you
want me dead.

01:24:44.754 --> 01:24:46.989
Nobody wants to kill you, John.
Nobody wants to kill you.

01:24:47.057 --> 01:24:48.491
Nobody wants
to kill me?

01:24:48.559 --> 01:24:49.525
No.
Nobody.

01:24:49.593 --> 01:24:51.461
None of these guys?
Not him?

01:24:51.528 --> 01:24:52.496
No.

01:24:52.564 --> 01:24:54.331
Oh, okay.
What is this?

01:24:54.399 --> 01:24:55.499
What is this?

01:25:00.738 --> 01:25:02.573
What did you think
would happen?

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.741
You want truth?
Here's some truth.

01:25:04.809 --> 01:25:07.478
This is going to end up
bad for you, John.

01:25:07.545 --> 01:25:09.779
There's only two ways
out of here--

01:25:09.847 --> 01:25:13.550
jail or dead.

01:25:13.618 --> 01:25:18.223
My son is very sick
and he needs some help.

01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:20.858
I understand. It's hard
to be a man these days,

01:25:20.926 --> 01:25:22.893
hard to know
what the right thing is.

01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:24.962
But put the gun down,
John.

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:26.764
You're not hearing me,
Frank!

01:25:26.832 --> 01:25:29.367
My son is sick!
That's it!

01:25:29.435 --> 01:25:32.303
There's nothing else.
End of story.

01:25:33.772 --> 01:25:36.975
When people are sick,
they deserve a little help.

01:25:37.043 --> 01:25:38.177
Yeah!

01:25:38.245 --> 01:25:40.879
Sick, help.

01:25:40.947 --> 01:25:44.049
Sick, help.

01:25:44.117 --> 01:25:48.487
I am not
going to bury my son!

01:25:49.623 --> 01:25:52.924
My son
is going to bury me.

01:25:52.992 --> 01:25:55.161
You think these people
give a shit about you?

01:25:55.228 --> 01:25:58.765
They don't. You're just
the cause of the moment.

01:25:58.832 --> 01:26:01.401
Nobody cares, John.
That's the real truth.

01:26:01.469 --> 01:26:04.037
Nobody cares. Only you.

01:26:05.139 --> 01:26:07.840
And it's only you
and me out here

01:26:07.908 --> 01:26:12.245
and all these guns
pointed at you.

01:26:12.313 --> 01:26:14.314
What do you want to do?
It's your call.

01:26:14.382 --> 01:26:16.015
I want my son.

01:26:17.117 --> 01:26:20.020
I want my son
inside with me.

01:26:20.088 --> 01:26:21.255
Can't do it, John!

01:26:21.323 --> 01:26:24.358
You give me my boy,
I give you your sniper.

01:26:24.426 --> 01:26:26.194
Then it's all over.

01:26:27.696 --> 01:26:30.130
You bring my son,

01:26:30.199 --> 01:26:32.966
I give up,

01:26:33.034 --> 01:26:34.968
everybody goes home...

01:26:37.506 --> 01:26:39.407
Everybody's safe.

01:26:42.945 --> 01:26:45.681
You bring me my son.

01:26:45.748 --> 01:26:46.815
Come on.

01:26:46.882 --> 01:26:48.917
All right.

01:26:50.386 --> 01:26:52.454
What do you think, Frank?

01:26:52.522 --> 01:26:53.988
Give it to him.

01:26:54.056 --> 01:26:56.325
He's not going to hurt anybody
with his boy in there.

01:26:56.392 --> 01:26:59.160
The object is to get
hostages out, not bring them in.

01:26:59.229 --> 01:27:02.030
It's not a hostage.
It's his son.

01:27:02.098 --> 01:27:05.801
Have all these people
been on the news?

01:27:05.869 --> 01:27:08.037
It's your call, Frank.

01:27:09.607 --> 01:27:11.040
Yeah.

01:27:12.943 --> 01:27:14.577
All right, give it to him.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.180
Hold it!

01:27:18.249 --> 01:27:19.849
No, listen to me
listen to me.

01:27:19.916 --> 01:27:22.385
I'm his mother.
I need to be in there!

01:27:24.256 --> 01:27:26.290
Stop! Stop!

01:27:26.358 --> 01:27:27.524
Stop right there!
Stop!

01:27:27.592 --> 01:27:30.427
Go! Go! Beat it!
Go! Now!

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:31.495
Go!
Go!

01:27:31.563 --> 01:27:33.063
Go!

01:27:45.777 --> 01:27:47.512
We're in trouble, John.

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:50.382
Mike's blood pressure
has dropped into the mid-40s.

01:27:50.449 --> 01:27:53.117
His atrial blood pressure
should be in the low teens.

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:54.319
It's 35.

01:27:54.387 --> 01:27:55.853
I'm sorry, John.

01:27:55.921 --> 01:27:59.824
Without a new heart,
he's not going to make it.

01:28:03.529 --> 01:28:05.062
Okay.

01:28:06.732 --> 01:28:08.100
Then take mine.

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:11.170
What?
You heard me.

01:28:11.237 --> 01:28:13.806
Take my heart,
and you put it in Mike.

01:28:13.873 --> 01:28:16.141
You done lost your damn mind.

01:28:16.209 --> 01:28:17.443
You can't be serious.

01:28:17.511 --> 01:28:19.745
You bet I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

01:28:19.813 --> 01:28:20.879
Oh, my God.

01:28:20.947 --> 01:28:23.349
Wow.
Man, you'll be dead.

01:28:23.417 --> 01:28:26.786
And my son will live.
It's the only way.

01:28:26.853 --> 01:28:28.987
No, physically,
you can't do this.

01:28:29.055 --> 01:28:31.558
Yes, I can.
I kill myself.

01:28:31.626 --> 01:28:33.627
You open me up,
you take my heart.

01:28:33.695 --> 01:28:35.662
It's perfect.
That's crazy.

01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:39.599
We can't just remove your heart
and put it into Michael's body.

01:28:39.667 --> 01:28:42.336
Matching donor and recipient
is extremely complicated.

01:28:42.403 --> 01:28:44.971
There are critical tests
that have to be taken--

01:28:45.039 --> 01:28:47.341
cross matches for blood type,
chest cavity measurements.

01:28:47.408 --> 01:28:50.043
If both blood tissues are not
completely compatible--

01:28:50.110 --> 01:28:53.381
I know about compatibility.
We've been tested up the wazoo.

01:28:53.449 --> 01:28:56.116
We're both b-positive.
Our tissues match.

01:28:56.184 --> 01:28:59.053
His heart's three times the size
of normal, so mine will fit.

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.021
You know damn well
we're compatible.

01:29:01.089 --> 01:29:02.457
Out of the question.
Too risky.

01:29:02.524 --> 01:29:04.525
Doc, I'm telling you,
he will make it!

01:29:04.593 --> 01:29:05.626
Can't do it.

01:29:05.694 --> 01:29:07.628
If I'm laying
on the floor, dead,

01:29:07.696 --> 01:29:10.064
you're not going to take
my heart and save his life?

01:29:10.131 --> 01:29:11.733
You'll let two die
instead of one

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.268
because of a technicality?

01:29:13.336 --> 01:29:15.738
I think what John
is trying to do is right.

01:29:15.805 --> 01:29:17.573
Me, too.
It's so brave.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.208
What do you think Mike
would want? Your wife?

01:29:20.276 --> 01:29:22.277
Mike's too young to know
what's good for him.

01:29:22.345 --> 01:29:26.147
It's my job to protect him.
Denise would do the same thing.

01:29:26.215 --> 01:29:30.469
John, look, I know what's
happening to Mike is bad.

01:29:30.471 --> 01:29:32.320
Matter of fact,
it's the worst.

01:29:32.389 --> 01:29:35.825
But killing yourself ain't
going to solve a damn thing.

01:29:35.893 --> 01:29:40.296
Sometimes you just
got to let go and let God...

01:29:40.364 --> 01:29:42.999
Just accept it, brother.

01:29:43.066 --> 01:29:45.268
Accept it?

01:29:45.335 --> 01:29:47.670
Accept what?

01:29:48.972 --> 01:29:50.339
Accept what?

01:29:50.408 --> 01:29:51.775
That Mike is going to die.

01:29:51.842 --> 01:29:53.376
No.

01:29:53.444 --> 01:29:57.548
No, I don't
accept that...Ever.

01:29:58.517 --> 01:30:00.484
No, I reject that
out of hand.

01:30:00.552 --> 01:30:03.120
I mean, look, all right,
he's a patient to you,

01:30:03.187 --> 01:30:05.989
I understand, but if you--
he's a good kid.

01:30:06.057 --> 01:30:08.592
I mean, he's--
he loves bodybuilding.

01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:12.362
He wants to be a bodybuilder.
Can you believe that?

01:30:12.431 --> 01:30:15.399
<i>He's funny, he's--
you'd like him.</i>

01:30:15.467 --> 01:30:18.002
You'd like him, doc,
if you got to know him.

01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:19.270
I do like him.

01:30:19.338 --> 01:30:22.040
Then, please,
I'm just begging you,

01:30:22.107 --> 01:30:23.374
step outside the rules.

01:30:23.443 --> 01:30:25.376
I'd like to, John,
I really would,

01:30:25.445 --> 01:30:27.378
but what you're asking
crosses the line.

01:30:27.447 --> 01:30:29.648
It is completely
unethical.

01:30:29.715 --> 01:30:31.650
I'm crossing the line?
You're crossing the line.

01:30:31.717 --> 01:30:33.985
The whole system
is crossing the line.

01:30:34.053 --> 01:30:36.387
Maybe you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

01:30:36.456 --> 01:30:40.359
I don't give a damn.
My son's going to live.

01:30:40.427 --> 01:30:42.361
Maybe you haven't
figured that out by now.

01:30:42.429 --> 01:30:45.030
I'll do whatever I got to do
for him to live.

01:30:45.098 --> 01:30:48.668
What are you going to do,
shoot me if I don't operate?

01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:51.604
No.

01:30:51.672 --> 01:30:53.873
I'm going to kill myself.

01:30:55.642 --> 01:30:59.078
All right?
Let's just see what happens.

01:30:59.145 --> 01:31:01.849
That's what this is all about, right?
He needs a donor.

01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:03.784
Somebody's got to die
for him to live.

01:31:03.852 --> 01:31:05.418
I'm his father.
It's me.

01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:16.530
All right.

01:31:16.598 --> 01:31:18.164
All right?
All right what?

01:31:18.232 --> 01:31:19.566
I'll do it.

01:31:19.634 --> 01:31:21.568
You're going to let him
kill himself?

01:31:21.636 --> 01:31:23.237
Once he's dead,
why not?

01:31:23.305 --> 01:31:25.640
You are the finest surgeon
I have ever known.

01:31:25.708 --> 01:31:29.377
You cannot throw your career,
your life away for this.

01:31:29.444 --> 01:31:30.912
If you do this,
you're finished.

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:33.114
What are they
going to do, sue me?

01:31:33.181 --> 01:31:35.182
Disbar me?

01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:37.652
Evict me
from the country club?

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.021
No, this is still a hospital.

01:31:40.088 --> 01:31:42.189
If there's a heart available,

01:31:42.257 --> 01:31:44.392
I'm not going to let it
go to waste.

01:31:44.459 --> 01:31:47.696
Doctor, Mr. Maguire,
let's get ready for surgery.

01:32:17.094 --> 01:32:18.562
They're ready to harvest.

01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:21.031
All right, hurry up, guys.

01:32:21.098 --> 01:32:22.832
Get her on the table.

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.067
What's our time?

01:32:24.134 --> 01:32:25.802
All right,
ready to lift.

01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:27.303
Count of three.

01:32:27.371 --> 01:32:28.806
Oh-four-five.

01:32:32.477 --> 01:32:33.811
Scalpels laid out.

01:32:33.879 --> 01:32:36.781
Where's his tray?
Got the other one ready?

01:32:43.689 --> 01:32:45.422
What do we have?

01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:48.392
Female donor,
26 years old...

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:51.129
She is 26 years old, 5'7".

01:32:51.197 --> 01:32:52.530
...kidneys usable.

01:32:52.599 --> 01:32:56.167
Liver and kidneys
are both usable. Lungs?

01:32:56.235 --> 01:32:57.302
Okay.

01:32:57.369 --> 01:32:58.937
Lungs are okay.
Heart?

01:32:59.005 --> 01:33:00.438
Heart is good.

01:33:00.506 --> 01:33:02.407
Heart is good.
Blood type?

01:33:03.676 --> 01:33:05.477
B-positive.

01:33:08.615 --> 01:33:10.749
This is my, uh...

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.687
My will.

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:18.257
It says I'm leaving my heart
to my son,

01:33:18.325 --> 01:33:20.994
and I need two witnesses
to sign.

01:33:21.061 --> 01:33:22.495
I'm not signing it.

01:33:22.562 --> 01:33:24.130
I ain't going to watch you
kill yourself.

01:33:24.197 --> 01:33:25.698
Me, neither.

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:28.935
The sooner you sign it,
the sooner you go home.

01:33:30.303 --> 01:33:32.739
Okay. I'll sign.

01:33:32.806 --> 01:33:34.508
Me, too.

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:47.121
So you're just going to go
in there and off yourself?

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:49.556
Only one thing
will stop me--

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:51.458
if Mitch is b-positive.

01:33:51.526 --> 01:33:55.095
No, no, no, no, no.
Type O. Swear to God.

01:34:00.502 --> 01:34:01.502
Thank you.

01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:03.204
You be good, huh?

01:34:03.272 --> 01:34:04.939
Be careful.

01:34:05.007 --> 01:34:06.207
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:17.688 --> 01:34:19.822
See you in the funny papers.

01:34:28.915 --> 01:34:31.000
Can I have a word with him?

01:34:34.437 --> 01:34:35.705
Thank you.

01:34:58.963 --> 01:35:00.564
Hey, Mike.

01:35:00.632 --> 01:35:03.500
Mikey.

01:35:03.568 --> 01:35:05.036
Mikey.

01:35:13.812 --> 01:35:14.946
How you doing, buddy?

01:35:15.013 --> 01:35:18.082
Hey, dad.

01:35:18.150 --> 01:35:21.518
Did you find me
a new heart?

01:35:24.190 --> 01:35:25.958
Yeah, we got you one.

01:35:26.025 --> 01:35:29.995
I guess you got
a guardian angel.

01:35:30.063 --> 01:35:31.230
Mike.
Mike.

01:35:31.297 --> 01:35:34.099
Just try to stay awake
just for a minute, okay?

01:35:34.167 --> 01:35:38.070
I just need to tell you
a few things.

01:35:38.138 --> 01:35:40.538
Okay, dad.

01:35:44.645 --> 01:35:47.981
You always listen
to your mother.

01:35:48.048 --> 01:35:50.183
You understand?

01:35:50.251 --> 01:35:52.585
Do what she tells you
to do.

01:35:55.156 --> 01:35:57.223
She's your best friend.

01:35:57.291 --> 01:36:00.193
You tell her you love her
every day.

01:36:00.261 --> 01:36:02.595
Okay, dad.

01:36:03.597 --> 01:36:05.732
Now, you're--you're--

01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:08.869
you're too young for girls
right now, but...

01:36:10.172 --> 01:36:13.073
There's
going to come a time.

01:36:13.141 --> 01:36:17.311
When it does, you treat them
like princesses,

01:36:17.378 --> 01:36:19.680
'cause that's what they are.

01:36:23.518 --> 01:36:25.752
When you say you're
going to do something...

01:36:42.071 --> 01:36:44.806
When you say you're going to
do something, you do it.

01:36:46.876 --> 01:36:49.278
Because your word is your bond, son.

01:36:49.346 --> 01:36:51.280
It's all you have.

01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:56.152
And money. You make money
if you get a chance,

01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:58.321
even if you got to sell out
once in a while.

01:36:58.388 --> 01:37:00.323
Make as much money
as you can.

01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:01.724
Don't be stupid
like your father.

01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:02.859
Okay.

01:37:02.926 --> 01:37:06.462
Everything is so much easier
with money, son.

01:37:07.865 --> 01:37:09.465
Don't smoke.

01:37:13.304 --> 01:37:15.973
Be kind to people.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.075
When somebody chooses you--

01:37:18.142 --> 01:37:21.678
we talked about this.
You stand up. You be a man.

01:37:22.947 --> 01:37:24.014
And y--

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:28.085
You stay away
from the bad things, son.

01:37:28.152 --> 01:37:29.519
Please.

01:37:31.089 --> 01:37:33.657
Don't get caught up
in the bad things.

01:37:35.727 --> 01:37:38.829
There's so many great things
out there for you.

01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:50.808
I'll never leave you.

01:37:59.986 --> 01:38:01.954
I'm always with you.

01:38:05.658 --> 01:38:07.293
Right there.

01:38:13.199 --> 01:38:15.134
I love you, son.

01:38:39.794 --> 01:38:41.628
I'll see you later.

01:38:42.564 --> 01:38:44.265
Yes?

01:38:45.767 --> 01:38:46.900
Okay.

01:38:46.969 --> 01:38:48.402
Turner gets the other one.

01:38:55.077 --> 01:38:57.144
Match with donor.

01:39:05.921 --> 01:39:08.656
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

01:39:22.072 --> 01:39:24.840
Okay, let's do it.

01:39:44.496 --> 01:39:46.663
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:48.465
that gun was empty
the whole time?

01:39:48.533 --> 01:39:50.034
Yeah.

01:39:50.101 --> 01:39:51.568
Yeah, I'm all talk.

01:39:51.636 --> 01:39:55.406
The only one I ever
considered killing was me.

01:40:11.157 --> 01:40:13.158
Maybe we should get
some towels.

01:40:13.225 --> 01:40:15.593
Ms. Payne! Ms. Payne.
Yeah.

01:40:15.661 --> 01:40:17.762
You're not going to
believe this. We got a match.

01:40:17.829 --> 01:40:19.797
B-positive.
Michael William Archibald,

01:40:19.865 --> 01:40:21.832
the only status one
in the whole country.

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:23.701
I'll be damned.

01:40:43.690 --> 01:40:45.458
I'm thirsty.

01:40:50.965 --> 01:40:52.665
Mrs. Archibald!

01:40:52.733 --> 01:40:55.768
We have some
very good news for you.

01:41:02.210 --> 01:41:03.477
Aah!

01:41:07.315 --> 01:41:09.015
Jesus.

01:41:14.823 --> 01:41:16.491
The safety's on.

01:41:16.558 --> 01:41:17.825
Is this for real?

01:41:17.892 --> 01:41:19.427
The jet landed
at O'Hare.

01:41:19.495 --> 01:41:21.862
The helicopter's going to
be here in 15 minutes.

01:41:21.930 --> 01:41:24.898
You do the honors,
okay? Go.

01:41:27.636 --> 01:41:28.569
John?

01:41:28.637 --> 01:41:31.472
John, baby, it's me.

01:41:32.742 --> 01:41:35.977
John.
It's not working.

01:41:36.045 --> 01:41:39.348
John? John!

01:41:39.415 --> 01:41:41.916
Please, baby, pick up.
John, can you--

01:41:45.188 --> 01:41:46.255
John!

01:41:56.267 --> 01:41:58.801
John!

01:42:02.105 --> 01:42:04.774
John, it's a miracle, baby!
They found a heart!

01:42:04.841 --> 01:42:07.943
John! It's a miracle!
They found a heart!

01:42:08.011 --> 01:42:09.945
<i>The heart is here!</i>

01:42:10.013 --> 01:42:13.216
<i>I repeat--the heart for little
Mike Archibald has arrived.</i>

01:42:13.284 --> 01:42:17.288
<i>What an unbelievable ending to
this incredible, tumultuous day.</i>

01:42:17.355 --> 01:42:18.589
<i>There they are.</i>

01:42:18.657 --> 01:42:20.457
<i>Okay, here we go.
Here we go.</i>

01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:27.097
<i>Yes, the hostages
are coming out.</i>

01:42:27.165 --> 01:42:28.765
<i>One, two.</i>

01:42:28.833 --> 01:42:31.235
<i>They appear to be unharmed
but certainly exhausted</i>

01:42:31.303 --> 01:42:34.104
<i>from what must have been
an excruciating ordeal. </i>

01:42:34.172 --> 01:42:37.542
<i>More now! More coming out,
hands waving in the air.</i>

01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:39.644
<i>Freedom. Freedom at last.</i>

01:42:39.712 --> 01:42:42.180
<i>Police are escorting them
one by one to safety.</i>

01:42:42.248 --> 01:42:43.682
<i>How do you feel?</i>

01:42:43.749 --> 01:42:45.116
<i>Somebody else is coming.</i>

01:42:45.184 --> 01:42:46.951
<i>It's John Q!</i>

01:42:47.019 --> 01:42:49.120
<i>John Q has come out,
hands in the air.</i>

01:42:49.188 --> 01:42:53.057
<i>He's putting the gun down.
He appears to be surrendering.</i>

01:42:53.125 --> 01:42:56.494
<i>The police are approaching
cautiously now.</i>

01:42:56.562 --> 01:43:00.065
<i>And they've got him.
They've subdued John Q.</i>

01:43:00.133 --> 01:43:02.768
<i>The handcuffs are on,
and it appears to be over.</i>

01:43:02.836 --> 01:43:04.870
<i>It's all over.</i>

01:43:04.938 --> 01:43:06.706
<i>If pictures
speak a thousand words,</i>

01:43:06.773 --> 01:43:10.209
<i>then these images
do speak volumes.</i>

01:43:10.277 --> 01:43:13.613
<i>And now, as the bloody standoff
comes to an end, we remind you</i>

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.881
that channel 8 news
was here first

01:43:15.949 --> 01:43:18.851
with exclusive
moment-to-moment live coverage

01:43:18.918 --> 01:43:22.456
of "Crisis at Hope Memorial."

01:43:22.523 --> 01:43:24.324
I'm Tuck Lampley.

01:43:33.601 --> 01:43:35.302
Open those doors!

01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:37.203
Look out!
We're coming through!

01:43:37.272 --> 01:43:38.405
Come on!

01:43:47.048 --> 01:43:49.183
We love you, John!

01:43:49.251 --> 01:43:51.919
God bless you!
I'd do the same thing!

01:44:07.404 --> 01:44:09.338
Ha ha ha ha.

01:44:17.781 --> 01:44:19.264
Heart.

01:44:21.217 --> 01:44:22.551
Thank you.

01:44:25.254 --> 01:44:26.423
Metzenbaums.

01:44:30.394 --> 01:44:31.928
Prepare for cutting.

01:44:48.246 --> 01:44:51.248
Put these on for me,
would you do that?

01:44:51.316 --> 01:44:53.183
Take your time.

01:45:04.496 --> 01:45:05.663
Lift it.

01:45:07.899 --> 01:45:11.069
All right, done.
How beautiful was that?

01:45:11.136 --> 01:45:12.371
Pressure up.

01:45:12.438 --> 01:45:13.705
Pressure up.

01:45:13.773 --> 01:45:17.141
And now one, two, three.

01:45:24.049 --> 01:45:25.216
It worked!

01:45:25.284 --> 01:45:29.588
It worked, John!
It worked! Whoo!

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:41.868
<i>The other big story--
John Q goes on trial today</i>

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:44.704
<i>for kidnapping
and attempted murder charges</i>

01:45:44.772 --> 01:45:46.539
<i>all because an HMO
denied coverage</i>

01:45:46.607 --> 01:45:48.941
<i>for his son's
heart transplant.</i>

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:51.176
<i>...more expensive for you
in the future, HMOs,</i>

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:53.179
<i>to deny coverage
when people really need it...</i>

01:45:53.247 --> 01:45:57.150
<i>There are still 40 million
Americans who are uninsured...</i>

01:45:57.218 --> 01:45:59.386
<i>Tonight,
as the trial continues,</i>

01:45:59.454 --> 01:46:03.891
<i>John Quincy Archibald--
vigilante or heroic father?</i>

01:46:03.958 --> 01:46:06.894
<i>...is to sue the pants off them
for millions of dollars</i>

01:46:06.961 --> 01:46:08.529
<i>to let them know...</i>

01:46:10.899 --> 01:46:12.433
<i>We have known for years</i>

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:15.236
<i>this is a crappy
health care system.</i>

01:46:15.304 --> 01:46:17.472
<i>We've known we had to
do something...</i>

01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.474
<i>John Q was using one of
President Bush's</i>

01:46:19.542 --> 01:46:21.142
<i>faith-based health care plans.</i>

01:46:21.209 --> 01:46:24.479
<i>That's where you just pray,
and the government does nothin.</i>

01:46:24.547 --> 01:46:28.382
<i>The point is that the enemy
we're trying to identify is us.</i>

01:46:28.451 --> 01:46:29.918
<i>That's the point.</i>

01:46:29.985 --> 01:46:32.520
<i>We are the ones who shot down
national health care.</i>

01:46:32.588 --> 01:46:35.089
<i>We are the ones
who don't want our taxes raise.</i>

01:46:35.157 --> 01:46:38.260
<i>You have to look in the
mirror for this problem.</i>

01:46:38.328 --> 01:46:40.429
John. John!

01:46:40.497 --> 01:46:43.649
Back up. Come on.
Back up. Back.

01:46:43.716 --> 01:46:45.167
Just one question, please!

01:46:45.234 --> 01:46:46.469
Back!

01:46:48.638 --> 01:46:49.922
Back up.

01:46:50.006 --> 01:46:52.575
How's your son doing, John?

01:46:52.642 --> 01:46:54.710
John, a statement,
please!

01:46:54.778 --> 01:46:57.714
Out of the way.
Let's go.

01:46:57.782 --> 01:47:00.149
How are you feeling
right now, John?

01:47:00.217 --> 01:47:01.785
Smile, John!

01:47:15.933 --> 01:47:18.401
Has the jury reached
a verdict?

01:47:18.469 --> 01:47:20.337
We have, your honor.

01:47:20.405 --> 01:47:23.073
As to count one,
attempted murder--

01:47:23.141 --> 01:47:26.711
we find the defendant
John Quincy Archibald

01:47:26.778 --> 01:47:27.778
not guilty.

01:47:29.615 --> 01:47:31.582
Quiet, please.

01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:35.887
On count two,
armed criminal action--

01:47:35.954 --> 01:47:36.888
not guilty.

01:47:38.657 --> 01:47:39.924
Quiet!

01:47:39.992 --> 01:47:42.561

01:48:05.318 --> 01:48:07.954
we find the defendant...

01:48:08.022 --> 01:48:09.022
Guilty.

01:48:09.089 --> 01:48:11.591
Ohh!

01:48:11.659 --> 01:48:15.962
Quiet, please. Sentencing
will be one week from today.

01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:17.196
All rise.

01:48:20.333 --> 01:48:22.134
What are we looking at?

01:48:22.202 --> 01:48:23.903
He's going to do some time.

01:48:23.971 --> 01:48:26.640
The judge is not going to give
him more than three to five.

01:48:26.708 --> 01:48:30.510
I'll try and get it
down to two. I'm sorry.

01:48:34.082 --> 01:48:35.916
You all right, slugger?

01:48:35.984 --> 01:48:37.384
Yeah.

01:48:37.452 --> 01:48:39.386
You take good care
of your mother, okay?

01:48:39.454 --> 01:48:41.321
You're the man
of the house now.

01:48:41.389 --> 01:48:42.823
You have any problems,

01:48:42.891 --> 01:48:45.993
Jimmy and Gina
will be here for you, too.

01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:48.463
Okay.

01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:00.241
I'm so proud of you.

01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:08.050
Give them frigging hell, Johnny.
Don't worry about nothing.

01:49:08.118 --> 01:49:10.119
Hey, dad.

01:49:11.421 --> 01:49:13.155
Good-bye.

01:49:13.223 --> 01:49:15.758
It's not good-bye, son.

01:49:17.094 --> 01:49:18.928
See you later.

01:49:40.251 --> 01:49:42.352
Hey, John!

01:49:42.419 --> 01:49:46.023
Take care, man.
You my hero.

01:50:15.689 --> 01:50:17.355
Dad!

01:50:17.423 --> 01:50:19.357
