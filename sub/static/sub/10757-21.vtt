00:09.708 --> 00:12.222
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, listen to this.

00:12.502 --> 00:15.175
"Michael Hawkins
of Allentown, Pennsylvania,

00:15.464 --> 00:18.900
has donated his right lung
to his younger brother, Clovis."

00:19.218 --> 00:22.972
"Says Hawkins, 'l got two lungs,
but I only got one brother'."

00:23.305 --> 00:27.662
Isn't that something? The
love one brother feels for the other.

00:28.018 --> 00:30.009
What do you want?

00:30.562 --> 00:33.440
I need you to come
to a dog show with me.

00:33.732 --> 00:36.200
I would rather give you a lung.

00:36.485 --> 00:38.760
- Latte, please.
- Frasier, I beg you.

00:39.029 --> 00:43.102
It's at the Seattle Kennel Club
tomorrow night and Maris will be there.

00:43.450 --> 00:46.362
In what class will Maris be showing?

00:48.163 --> 00:50.393
She'll be showing no class.

00:50.666 --> 00:53.658
As she has ever since
she hooked up with Dr Schenkman.

00:53.961 --> 00:57.192
It's my first time seeing them
since we filed for divorce.

00:57.506 --> 00:59.462
Here's an idea, Niles. Don't go.

00:59.716 --> 01:04.584
If I don't go people will think I've
let Maris and Schenkman intimidate me.

01:04.971 --> 01:08.965
I want to prove that I'm strong and
independent and I can't do that alone.

01:12.563 --> 01:15.953
All right. If it's moral support
you need, I'll go with you.

01:16.275 --> 01:19.665
I'll pick you up around eight.
And I have a patient. Thank you.

01:20.153 --> 01:23.429
I knew I could count on you.
Some things never change.

01:23.740 --> 01:26.015
Do you know where I can get
a cheap hotel room?

01:26.285 --> 01:28.276
Case in point. Goodbye, Roz.

01:29.454 --> 01:31.888
Why do you need a hotel room?

01:32.165 --> 01:36.044
They're still painting my new place.
I can't be around those fumes.

01:36.378 --> 01:38.414
And they've rented my old apartment.

01:38.672 --> 01:41.425
Grande decaf latte, please.
I am on the street.

01:41.717 --> 01:46.268
You ordered a $4 cup of coffee.
"On the street" may be a tad dramatic.

01:46.638 --> 01:49.789
I've got to call around,
see if I can find something.

01:51.518 --> 01:55.636
Dad is going to San Francisco for the
weekend. You could always stay with me.

01:55.981 --> 02:00.213
That would sure make things easier. OK.

02:00.569 --> 02:03.879
Well, then, that's settled.
That's that, then.

02:04.197 --> 02:07.234
You didn't really
expect me to take you up on it.

02:07.534 --> 02:11.322
No. I wouldn't have offered
if it wasn't something I wanted to do.

02:11.663 --> 02:14.700
- All right.
- Here you go. And there's your check.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.275
- I'll get that.
- No, let me get that.

02:17.544 --> 02:18.943
OK, thanks.

02:19.171 --> 02:21.924
Lucky me.
I'm getting everything I want today.

02:26.762 --> 02:28.912
- It's about time.
- Calm down, Dad.

02:29.181 --> 02:32.491
I was getting worried.
My plane leaves at five o'clock.

02:32.809 --> 02:35.403
- Your blood pressure medicine.
- I don't need it.

02:35.687 --> 02:37.678
Pack it anyway!

02:39.733 --> 02:42.327
What's this? Earrings?

02:42.611 --> 02:47.002
I picked them up for Daphne at the
drug store. She ran some errands for me.

02:47.366 --> 02:50.881
- Nice. Are they sapphires?
- Yes. I always buy precious stones

02:51.203 --> 02:54.912
at the same counter where I pick up
corn pads and Wart-Be-Gone.

02:55.249 --> 02:59.447
- Shouldn't you be going?
- There's something I want to give you.

02:59.795 --> 03:02.229
A token of my appreciation.

03:02.506 --> 03:06.215
- Dr Crane, you remembered.
- Of course I did.

03:06.552 --> 03:10.147
Can you believe it was five years ago
today that I came to work here?

03:10.472 --> 03:14.351
I knew you wouldn't let an important
occasion like this go by unnoticed.

03:14.685 --> 03:17.836
- But I wasn't expecting a gift.
- Well, it's a tiny gift.

03:18.146 --> 03:20.216
Oh, my God! Sapphires.

03:22.401 --> 03:25.598
- Actually, Daphne...
- These must have cost a fortune.

03:25.904 --> 03:28.577
My friend Molly got a diamond bracelet
from her boss

03:28.866 --> 03:32.541
but she worked for him for ten years
and she was sleeping with him.

03:32.870 --> 03:35.782
I got sapphires and
I didn't even have to sleep with you.

03:36.081 --> 03:39.517
Although now that I've got
the sapphires... What am I saying?

03:39.835 --> 03:41.826
Is it rude if I go and try these on?

03:42.087 --> 03:45.363
I have to see what they look like.
I've never had real jewellery.

03:45.674 --> 03:47.232
I'm speechless.

03:49.845 --> 03:53.804
Dear God,
she believes they're genuine sapphires.

03:54.141 --> 03:59.977
- You think?
- I'll have to tell her the truth.

04:00.397 --> 04:03.150
Why? Didn't you see how happy she was?

04:03.442 --> 04:06.161
I can't let her think
I gave her something I didn't.

04:06.445 --> 04:09.642
Honesty between friends
is far more precious than any gem.

04:09.948 --> 04:13.543
I feel like a princess.
I'm never going to take them off.

04:13.869 --> 04:15.621
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

04:18.498 --> 04:21.410
You even remembered
that sapphires are my birthstone.

04:21.709 --> 04:26.181
- There's no end to your thoughtfulness.
- Somebody has to keep track.

04:26.548 --> 04:29.779
- I should be getting to the airport.
- I'll get my keys.

04:30.093 --> 04:32.653
No, absolutely not. I'll drive Mr Crane.

04:32.930 --> 04:37.003
You're not lifting a finger. You ring
for the elevator, I'll grab me coat.

04:37.351 --> 04:40.980
My flight's at five. They told me
to get there an hour early.

04:42.147 --> 04:45.742
- Did you pack your medicine?
- Yes, but I told you, I don't need it.

04:46.443 --> 04:49.355
- Hey, guys.
- Frasier, help her with that stuff.

04:49.655 --> 04:52.453
- Thanks for letting me use your room.
- No problem.

04:52.741 --> 04:55.209
So you're off to San Francisco?

04:55.494 --> 04:57.928
Duke and l
took our shore leave there in '52.

04:58.205 --> 05:01.561
- Going to re-trace our steps.
- Sure sounds like fun.

05:01.875 --> 05:07.313
We had a great time. No place like
'Frisco for a guy cruising the streets

05:07.714 --> 05:10.592
looking for a good time.

05:10.884 --> 05:15.082
You know, Dad, I think you'll find that
'Frisco hasn't changed all that much.

05:16.515 --> 05:19.154
Well, I hope not. Bye.

05:19.434 --> 05:22.949
Hey, Roz. Just off to the airport.
Back in a bit. See you later.

05:23.272 --> 05:25.627
Come in. You're earlier than I expected.

05:25.899 --> 05:29.938
I had to get out sooner than I thought.
I left you a message.

05:30.279 --> 05:32.668
I didn't check my machine
all day today.

05:32.948 --> 05:37.658
Thank you so much for this.
You won't even know I'm here.

05:38.036 --> 05:40.630
<i>You have 13 messages.</i>

05:41.665 --> 05:44.975
I had my calls forwarded.
I hope you don't mind.

05:46.461 --> 05:47.894
<i>Hey, Roz, it's Marco.</i>

05:48.130 --> 05:52.328
<i>I'm coming to town. Are you busy
Saturday night... late? Call me.</i>

05:52.676 --> 05:56.464
Obviously Marco and I haven't talked
for a long time.

05:56.805 --> 06:00.002
Something tells me
you never talked for a long time.

06:00.309 --> 06:04.985
<i>Roz? This is Paula Garrett, Rick's mom.
We just found out about the baby,</i>

06:05.355 --> 06:07.949
<i>and we think it's important to meet you.</i>

06:08.233 --> 06:11.270
<i>We're seeing Rick in Paris
day after tomorrow,</i>

06:11.570 --> 06:13.686
<i>so any time before then would be fine.</i>

06:13.947 --> 06:16.984
<i>I'm running out now.
Maybe I'll try you later.</i>

06:17.701 --> 06:20.010
Oh, my God. What do they want?

06:20.287 --> 06:23.484
They want to meet you.
They are your child's grandparents.

06:23.790 --> 06:27.146
I worked this out with Rick.
He's 20 years old, still in college

06:27.461 --> 06:30.180
and it's best
if I raise this baby by myself.

06:30.464 --> 06:33.774
I've got to put up with in-laws
and I don't even have a husband.

06:34.092 --> 06:38.802
That's like posing nude for your art
teacher and still flunking the course.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.695
Shut up, I needed the credit.

06:43.936 --> 06:47.406
- All they want is a short meeting.
- That's what they say now.

06:47.731 --> 06:50.199
What if they want another one
after that?

06:50.484 --> 06:52.759
What if they don't think
I'm a fit mother?

06:53.028 --> 06:55.667
What if they're nice, supportive people?

06:55.948 --> 07:00.180
I just don't want to do this, Frasier.
It's not comfortable.

07:01.912 --> 07:02.901
Roz...

07:05.123 --> 07:09.480
I could go with you... if you like.

07:09.836 --> 07:13.033
Better yet, we could have them here
tomorrow night.

07:13.340 --> 07:17.049
Niles and I have that dog show at eight.
They could come before that.

07:17.386 --> 07:18.739
I don't know.

07:18.971 --> 07:21.246
- I'll be that's Mrs Garrett.
- I'm not here.

07:23.308 --> 07:28.428
Hello? Yes, she is.
Yes, she did get your message.

07:30.482 --> 07:34.191
No, I'm afraid
she won't be able to meet you.

07:37.114 --> 07:40.902
Yes, I understand that you're upset.
I'm terribly sorry.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.199
Goodbye.

07:43.453 --> 07:45.330
Thank you, Frasier. Thank you.

07:45.581 --> 07:48.812
That was Marco.
Now we're calling Mrs Garrett.

07:52.379 --> 07:56.497
All right, give it to me straight.
How do I look?

07:59.803 --> 08:03.432
Like Pollyanna grew up
and got herself in a little trouble.

08:04.391 --> 08:07.303
Why am I doing this?
How did I let you talk me into this?

08:07.603 --> 08:11.516
It will mean a lot to them.
You can learn about your baby's lineage.

08:11.857 --> 08:16.692
A lot of things are inherited, you know,
like intelligence, artistic ability...

08:17.070 --> 08:21.541
- I've got to check my make-up.
- Roz, this should be fun.

08:21.909 --> 08:24.821
It's like a little preview
of who your child might be.

08:27.956 --> 08:30.106
Hi, there. Steve Garrett.

08:35.172 --> 08:38.926
- My wife's just... Honey?
- It was nice seeing you, too.

08:39.259 --> 08:43.934
What a coincidence. Your neighbour
goes to my hair salon. Hi, I'm Paula.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.866
Frasier Crane. Won't you please come in?

08:48.644 --> 08:54.560
Roz will be out in a second.
She just went to powder her... self.

08:54.983 --> 08:59.374
We hope this isn't too awkward for her.
She sounded anxious on the phone.

08:59.738 --> 09:03.253
Who could blame her? She doesn't
know what kind of people we are.

09:03.575 --> 09:07.170
A situation like this is enough
to make anyone a little nervous.

09:07.496 --> 09:09.771
Roz isn't the nervous type.

09:14.419 --> 09:18.173
Roz? This is Steve and Paula Garrett.

09:20.467 --> 09:23.504
We don't blame you for being shocked.

09:23.804 --> 09:27.080
We're used to it.
You should see the looks we get.

09:27.391 --> 09:29.905
You were taken aback,
weren't you, Dr Crane?

09:30.185 --> 09:33.461
- Certainly not.
- Everyone comments on it.

09:33.772 --> 09:36.286
I must admit when I opened the door I...

09:36.567 --> 09:40.526
Couldn't believe we were old enough
to have a 20-year-old son.

09:42.447 --> 09:46.759
Exactly. You know, you both look
so young, don't they, Roz?

09:51.415 --> 09:54.373
Yes, young. Very, very young.

09:54.668 --> 10:00.186
Roz, you're uncomfortable but we have
no intention of intruding on your life.

10:00.591 --> 10:03.230
Rick told us how wonderful you are.

10:03.510 --> 10:07.742
We just wanted to offer any help or
support you think is appropriate.

10:08.098 --> 10:10.658
Thanks. That's very nice.

10:10.934 --> 10:13.494
I thought your guests
might be a little peckish.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.045
Daphne Moon, Steve and Paula Garrett.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.306
Hello, I...

10:21.904 --> 10:26.420
I know, it's amazing.
They are the parents of a 20-year-old.

10:26.783 --> 10:28.933
Amazing.

10:29.203 --> 10:30.192
Excuse me.

10:32.831 --> 10:34.310
Niles, you're early.

10:34.541 --> 10:37.931
I thought you might want to grab
a bite to eat before the dog show.

10:38.253 --> 10:41.768
I'm sorry,
I didn't realise that you had...

10:43.342 --> 10:46.937
Company. Steve and Paula Garrett,
this is my brother Niles Crane.

10:47.262 --> 10:50.572
The Garretts are the grandparents-to-be
of Roz's baby.

10:50.891 --> 10:53.724
- Nice to meet you.
- Did I hear you mention a dog show?

10:54.019 --> 10:56.772
The Seattle Kennel Club
is having its annual event.

10:57.064 --> 11:02.775
Steve and I went to that a few years
ago. We have two giant Schnauzers.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:15.040 --> 11:17.235
My goodness, Paula, look at the view.

11:17.501 --> 11:19.890
Roz, show the Garretts the view.

11:20.170 --> 11:23.560
That would be nice.
I could use a breath of fresh air.

11:30.264 --> 11:34.382
Just stop it, the two of you. You're
acting like a couple of two-year-olds.

11:36.311 --> 11:39.621
- I'm home.
- Dad. What are you doing here?

11:39.940 --> 11:43.250
'Frisco was a bust.
All our watering holes are gone.

11:43.569 --> 11:45.605
The steakhouse was a sushi bar.

11:45.863 --> 11:48.696
And Duke and I went out for a walk.
We passed City Hall

11:48.991 --> 11:52.188
and there's this big crowd,
like a pep rally or something.

11:52.494 --> 11:56.487
So we joined them. Some official guy
says something that we didn't hear.

11:56.832 --> 12:00.871
Then everybody's throwing rice
and all the men are kissing each other

12:01.211 --> 12:04.362
and all the women are kissing each other
and I'm not sure,

12:04.673 --> 12:06.868
but I think Duke and I may be married.

12:09.303 --> 12:14.093
The whole weekend was like that.
Just one surprising event...

12:21.565 --> 12:27.276
- I'm sorry. Did we startle you?
- No, I didn't know we had company.

12:28.030 --> 12:31.340
Dad, this is Steve and Paula Garrett.
They're Rick's parents.

12:31.658 --> 12:34.730
Hi, how are you?
Nice to meet you. Marty Crane.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.931
They're just on their way to Paris
to visit Rick.

12:39.249 --> 12:41.126
That sounds like fun.

12:41.376 --> 12:45.847
I'm just a little nervous. I hear
the Parisians can be kind of snooty.

12:46.798 --> 12:49.870
Excuse me.
I've got something in the oven.

12:50.177 --> 12:54.011
- Let me help you.
- Yeah, me, too.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.473
We've got to stop. They'll hear us.

13:05.734 --> 13:09.204
- Mmm, what's that I smell?
- Probably Japan.

13:20.249 --> 13:22.558
What is the matter with you people?

13:22.834 --> 13:25.064
Don't say you don't think this is funny?

13:25.337 --> 13:30.172
They are two perfectly nice people
who happen to have large noses.

13:30.551 --> 13:32.542
Sniggering like school children.

13:32.803 --> 13:37.274
If you can't get yourself under control,
you can just stay in here.

13:38.642 --> 13:42.271
- Quiche Lorraine, anyone?
- Quiche her? I hardly know her.

13:44.439 --> 13:47.317
- That smells wonderful.
- Does it ever.

13:50.654 --> 13:53.487
Is this homemade or store-bought?

13:53.782 --> 13:58.253
Honey, don't ask that. Pardon my wife.
Sometimes she gets a little nosy.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.214
Me nosy? You're the nosy one
in the family.

14:01.498 --> 14:03.693
Anyone who knows you knows you're nosy.

14:03.959 --> 14:06.792
Anyone who knows you
knows you're nosier.

14:11.466 --> 14:13.457
Something wrong, Fras?

14:19.099 --> 14:21.215
Quiche her, I hardly know her.

14:24.646 --> 14:27.718
I just... got that.

14:36.909 --> 14:40.822
In spite of a shaky beginning,
this evening's turned out rather well.

14:41.163 --> 14:44.599
Yeah. And you were
absolutely right, Frasier.

14:44.917 --> 14:48.114
Now I can see some of the qualities
my baby can have.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.571
A great sense of humour
and a sweet disposition,

14:51.882 --> 14:53.873
a nose like an anteater.

14:56.345 --> 15:01.658
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
Rick had a fine nose. And so do you.

15:02.059 --> 15:04.050
I'm sure your baby will have one, too.

15:04.311 --> 15:08.224
You're right. If Rick can beat
those genes, my baby has a chance.

15:09.816 --> 15:12.011
How long have you been
working for Dr Crane?

15:12.277 --> 15:16.350
Five years yesterday. He gave me
a beautiful pair of sapphire earrings

15:16.698 --> 15:19.451
- to mark the occasion.
- Frasier gave you sapphires?

15:19.743 --> 15:22.462
- Who's for coffee?
- I'll take some.

15:22.746 --> 15:26.785
You must show those earrings to Steve.
He's a jeweller.

15:27.125 --> 15:30.674
He could probably even tell you
what mine the stones came from.

15:31.004 --> 15:34.041
Maybe coffee's a bad idea.
You've got that early flight.

15:34.341 --> 15:37.299
Daphne, could you take this
back in the kitchen?

15:37.594 --> 15:40.062
One of me earrings must have fallen off.

15:40.347 --> 15:43.259
- We'll help you find it.
- What does it look like?

15:43.559 --> 15:46.835
Once you've seen one sapphire,
you've seen them all.

15:47.145 --> 15:49.943
That's not true.
They vary widely in quality.

15:50.232 --> 15:53.383
Why don't you just get up
and we have to get going.

15:53.694 --> 15:56.492
We have plenty in here
to form a search party.

15:56.780 --> 16:01.331
- We'll just trample each other.
- We do have a big day tomorrow.

16:01.702 --> 16:04.694
You might as well
get a little sleep before you take off.

16:04.997 --> 16:08.990
I might be able to replace the earring.
Let me see the other one.

16:09.334 --> 16:11.973
I found it. Here it is.
I knew I would. Bon voyage.

16:12.254 --> 16:15.485
- Dr Crane...
- No, Daphne, just a second.

16:15.799 --> 16:18.359
It was wonderful of you to come.

16:18.635 --> 16:21.513
Thank you for having us.
Roz, it was great meeting you.

16:21.805 --> 16:24.114
- Our door is always open.
- Have a great trip.

16:24.391 --> 16:25.824
- Good night.
- Good night.

16:27.936 --> 16:29.927
Can I have it then?

16:30.188 --> 16:34.227
I'm sorry, it was just a piece of lint.
Well, the search continues.

16:34.568 --> 16:38.402
The one precious thing anyone's ever
bought me in my whole stinking life

16:38.739 --> 16:42.049
- and I lose it.
- Daphne, I found it.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.756
Dr Crane, I could kiss you.

16:45.037 --> 16:46.026
OK.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.150
- What's this?
- Nothing.

16:55.589 --> 17:01.141
The setting's come loose. It's only blue
on top. The bottom's all coppery.

17:01.553 --> 17:02.622
Dr Crane.

17:02.846 --> 17:06.839
I know what you're thinking,
and you are right. Obviously, I...

17:07.184 --> 17:09.903
You've been swindled.
Where did you buy these?

17:10.186 --> 17:14.782
I want to take these back and tell that
lying cheat exactly what I think of him.

17:15.150 --> 17:18.699
- Actually, you just did.
- You knew?

17:19.029 --> 17:24.103
- Niles, how about a cup of coffee?
- Thanks, Roz. Cream and sugar.

17:28.247 --> 17:33.241
I'm terribly sorry, Daphne.
I actually meant to tell you eventually.

17:33.627 --> 17:36.539
You didn't need to.
Her earlobe's turning green.

17:39.466 --> 17:43.379
Daphne, the truth is
I didn't remember your anniversary.

17:46.181 --> 17:49.730
I saw them and I thought they
were pretty. So I bought them for you

17:50.060 --> 17:54.099
and you thought they were genuine.
You seemed so happy, I...

17:55.649 --> 18:00.200
They are pretty.
I suppose I can have them repaired.

18:00.571 --> 18:03.802
I'll just take them back
to the jewellery store.

18:10.247 --> 18:13.603
Actually, I bought them at Raymond's.

18:14.877 --> 18:17.232
Raymond's Drug Store?

18:17.504 --> 18:21.383
The good news is they'll probably
carry something for that ear infection.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.308
I almost forgot.
Roz, I brought you something.

18:33.604 --> 18:37.916
I thought you might get a kick out
of these pictures of Ricky as a boy.

18:38.275 --> 18:40.948
Thank you. That is so nice of you.

18:42.696 --> 18:45.449
- Where is he? I don't see him.
- There, in the middle.

18:48.076 --> 18:51.193
- He looks so different.
- That was before his hockey accident.

18:51.496 --> 18:53.566
The nose job changed his whole face.

18:53.832 --> 18:58.587
The doctor did a good job, but
that's the Ricky you'll see in the baby.

19:01.089 --> 19:04.604
- Well, thanks.
- You're welcome. And bye again.

19:04.927 --> 19:07.487
- Take care now. Good to see you.
- Thanks.

19:08.472 --> 19:10.190
Oh, my God!

19:10.432 --> 19:13.265
Come on, Roz.
It can't be that bad. Let me see.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.028
- No, I'll never hear the end of it.
- Please.

19:20.943 --> 19:22.934
Where is the end of it?

19:30.494 --> 19:33.452
Roz, you're not still looking
at that picture, are you?

19:33.747 --> 19:36.056
No, this is a different one.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.630
Look at the way the ears
on this poor little girl stick out.

19:42.005 --> 19:47.284
It's me. Age nine.
The year before I got them fixed.

19:47.678 --> 19:52.274
Sorry, Roz. I didn't recognise you
with those glasses.

19:52.641 --> 19:56.600
- Why is one side blacked out?
- I had a lazy eye.

19:59.815 --> 20:02.170
I got that fixed the next year.

20:02.442 --> 20:05.991
Let's just say for birthdays,
I wasn't asking for ponies.

20:06.321 --> 20:08.391
You poor thing.

20:08.657 --> 20:12.969
What if my kid gets Rick's nose
and my ears and eyes?

20:13.328 --> 20:16.604
With my grandfather's third nipple,
I might as well pitch a tent

20:16.915 --> 20:19.429
and charge admission.

20:19.710 --> 20:22.622
Nothing like that's going to happen.

20:22.921 --> 20:25.276
I just hate the idea
of my kid being teased.

20:27.217 --> 20:32.086
I know what that's like. As long as
my baby's in here, I can protect it.

20:32.472 --> 20:36.943
But pretty soon this kid's
going to be out there on his own.

20:37.311 --> 20:41.543
Every child goes through a bit of
teasing. It's part of growing up.

20:41.899 --> 20:45.858
At least yours will have a mother
who understands what it feels like.

20:46.195 --> 20:48.755
And you'll know what to say
to make it better.

20:49.031 --> 20:51.465
I really hadn't thought of it that way.

20:51.742 --> 20:54.336
I'm good at finding
the positive in things.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.929
Look at what happened to me tonight.

20:57.206 --> 20:59.800
I could say I worked for someone
for five years

21:00.083 --> 21:04.076
and he forgot my anniversary and bought
me a worthless piece of blue glass.

21:04.421 --> 21:07.777
But I'd rather say
he gave me a nice pair of earrings

21:08.091 --> 21:10.286
just because he thought I'd like them.

21:10.552 --> 21:12.941
Which is sweet when you think about it.

21:13.222 --> 21:17.420
- Frasier will be relieved to hear that.
- I'm not going to tell him.

21:18.602 --> 21:22.390
- I'm ready for bed.
- Yeah, me, too. Thanks again, Daphne.

21:22.731 --> 21:24.483
You're welcome.

21:24.733 --> 21:27.327
I just felt a big kick.

21:27.611 --> 21:29.727
You sure it wasn't a sneeze?

21:29.988 --> 21:32.024
It's the last one. I promise.
