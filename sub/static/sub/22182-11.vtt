WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.239
I'm an American citizen.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.807
Don't let him do this.
Move!

00:06.840 --> 00:09.543
Or I will shoot through you.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.179
GALLO: The prisoner who got away
is Davis Goundry.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.646
We stumbled onto something here.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.682
Davis Goundry is a
former agency operative

00:14.715 --> 00:16.050
who flipped and became

00:16.084 --> 00:17.218
Khalid Samatar's
right-hand man.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.253
You recruited him into the CIA.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.821
You know how he thinks
better than anyone.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.656
THEA: Sir, it doesn't add up
that Goundry turned.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.757
The only proof that we have
that he's bad

00:23.791 --> 00:25.593
is the proof Richard gave us.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.727
Jimmy.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.129
I don't have much time.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.597
A man named Khalid
has sent uranium

00:29.630 --> 00:32.366
to an associate in the U.S.
to make a bomb.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.734
Let the manhunt begin.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.603
We met in a Black
Hawk before, Davis.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.106
They framed me. Now, I
am not the real traitor.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.173
Richard was.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.310
Engage.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.844
Hey. He's gone.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.279
There's no bomb in here.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.747
Thank you again, Professor.
Please.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.382
Let me know if you ever need
anything else.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.284
I've seen the news.
I know about the leak.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.285
I would go through anything

00:51.319 --> 00:53.087
to bring you home.
Jess...

00:53.121 --> 00:54.355
Last night you said things
which made it seem

00:54.388 --> 00:56.324
like the leak
may have come from you.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.391
We're gonna get Jimmy this time.

00:57.425 --> 00:58.759
I have a good feeling about it.

00:58.792 --> 00:59.793
I've been hiding something.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.229
I lied in my debrief.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.164
I shot Richard.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.599
I cannot look at you without
thinking about all the lies.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.536
I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.563
All right, great.
Thanks, Porter.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.398
This is the largest
training mock-up

01:37.431 --> 01:38.466
I've seen in a long time.

01:38.499 --> 01:39.733
Yeah. Most important mission

01:39.767 --> 01:41.435
we had to do
in a long time, too.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.309
Bob the Builder there
seems a bit more wound-up

01:48.342 --> 01:51.245
than usual.
Yeah.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.747
He still dealing
with what you told him?

01:53.781 --> 01:55.683
It's a little more than that.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.618
We broke up.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.754
I'm sorry.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.526
We can still trust him
not to tell what he knows.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.331
If there's anything that you,
you know, need, um...

02:10.364 --> 02:11.599
I'll be fine.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.503
So...

02:15.536 --> 02:17.505
this is the layout
where Jimmy might be.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.573
You seeing what I'm seeing?
Yeah.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.475
These power lines are gonna be
a hell of a problem.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.477
Our rotor blade hits
one of these, it's over.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.447
We've never been this close
to getting Jimmy before.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.681
Can't afford any mistakes now.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.787
*

02:41.862 --> 02:43.364
Thanks to satellite
surveillance,

02:43.397 --> 02:46.800
we now have a confirmed location
on Khalid Samatar.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.236
A Somali National
Army facility

02:48.269 --> 02:49.670
abandoned in the '90s.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.339
It is about 30 miles away

02:51.372 --> 02:52.606
from one of the villages
Khalid controls.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.875
We have footage of
him going in and out.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.710
We have high confidence he is

02:56.744 --> 02:58.546
holding Sergeant Kam in
the bunker under this building.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.348
But even if not,

03:00.381 --> 03:01.749
we get Khalid,
he'll lead us to Kam.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.417
In other words,
this is the jackpot,

03:03.451 --> 03:05.386
which is why I've attached

03:05.419 --> 03:06.554
two of my best field agents

03:06.587 --> 03:08.322
to be on the ground team
for this mission.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.757
Both are experts on the region,

03:09.790 --> 03:11.959
highly trained in close combat

03:11.992 --> 03:13.494
and intel gathering.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.497
Officers Ben and Andrew,
please say hello.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.466
Sir, last time we had
one of your guys in our helo,

03:18.499 --> 03:19.600
he killed someone
he wasn't supposed to.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.570
MAGNUS: That was a very
unfortunate error, Captain.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.305
But I have no doubt
that once you train

03:24.338 --> 03:25.506
with these gentlemen,
they will earn

03:25.539 --> 03:26.440
your full confidence.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.776
Landing in this place
is not gonna be easy,

03:28.809 --> 03:31.445
so we built a scale model
for rehearsal.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.646
The area's heavily wooded.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.482
There are power lines;
a trench here.

03:34.515 --> 03:38.319
And Khalid also has an
anti-aircraft installation,

03:38.352 --> 03:39.487
and that is one klick away.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.422
Your Little Bird support
will take that out,

03:41.455 --> 03:43.457
and once they do,
Khalid will know you're there.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.726
From that moment, the target
time will be two minutes

03:45.759 --> 03:47.361
to get the ground team
into the bunker.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.596
Speed is mission critical.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.264
Captain Gallo, Ms. Madani,

03:50.298 --> 03:51.465
I want you to do the
planning and the briefing.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.466
Once that's in place,

03:52.500 --> 03:53.801
we will rehearse.
You deploy

03:53.834 --> 03:55.269
in 72 hours.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.470
ALL:
Hooah!

03:59.507 --> 04:02.376
Colonel, Director.
You have a moment?

04:02.410 --> 04:03.511
Yes, Porter.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.046
I was wondering if there's
any update on the uranium.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.048
Uh, Thea's working
on tracking it down before

04:08.081 --> 04:10.518
whoever has it turns it into
a bomb. In fact, I'm going

04:10.551 --> 04:11.485
to check in.
You want to come with?

04:11.519 --> 04:12.520
You're a Shadow
Raider, son.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.588
Hunting down bombs
isn't your job.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.590
Due respect, sir,
this is personal.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.891
You know he lost his father
in a terror attack.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.861
I am aware
of the lieutenant's history.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.433
Finish up your
mission intel report first.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.301
Thank you, sir.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.406
By the way,
are you working Saturday?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.575
Why do you ask?
Well...

04:34.608 --> 04:36.043
I am speaking

04:36.076 --> 04:38.612
at an international affairs
conference in Atlanta.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.415
Lot of fancy government types
are gonna be there.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.716
I believe your mother's
gonna be there.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.318
You should come.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.619
Some people I'd like
to introduce you to.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.589
I appreciate that, sir.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.723
Thank you.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.672
Jess.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.542
I can't believe
you'd show your face back here.

05:08.576 --> 05:09.710
I'm sorry. What?
Our husbands

05:09.743 --> 05:12.380
put their lives on the line
every day,

05:12.413 --> 05:13.947
and you repay them by selling
them out to the press?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.983
I was trying to help Jimmy.
That is all.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.051
How could you be so selfish?

05:20.854 --> 05:23.791
Mommy made a choice, that...

05:23.824 --> 05:27.060
It did not turn out
the way that she had hoped.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.662
So things might be

05:28.696 --> 05:29.963
a little bit different
from now on, okay?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.565
Okay.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.568
Let's go.

05:39.607 --> 05:40.841
MADANI: How many meters
from this L.Z.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.042
to the bunker entrance?

05:42.075 --> 05:43.377
About 200.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.512
That's too far.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.579
Coogan's guys are good.

05:45.613 --> 05:46.680
Yeah, but it's uphill.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.148
It's gonna feel
more like 400

05:48.181 --> 05:51.018
by the time they get there.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.420
There's another way.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.154
We hover here,
they fast-rope down.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.556
Normal circumstances,
hell yeah.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.458
But it's too risky
to hover

05:57.491 --> 05:58.559
with all these power lines.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.394
I mean, we hit 'em,
we're done.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.929
I didn't say
it would be easy,

06:01.962 --> 06:02.930
but it is possible.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.465
You used to be the cautious one.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.433
Now you want to pull

06:05.466 --> 06:07.501
one of the toughest maneuvers
we've ever done?

06:07.535 --> 06:09.637
I think this breakup's
screwing with your head.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.639
This is a professional
discussion.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.542
The personal stuff has got
nothing to do with it.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.576
All right.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.844
All right.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.712
So my plan's
a little riskier.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.614
The Gallo I used to
know was a cowboy.

06:20.648 --> 06:21.715
What ever happened
to that?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.517
I learned better...

06:23.551 --> 06:25.686
after taking a bunch of risks
on a bunch of missions

06:25.719 --> 06:27.187
that didn't
work out so well.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.022
Darzi got injured.
Sergeant Hendrix is dead.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.158
That's not your fault.
This is a no-fail mission.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.126
I need to keep my crew safe,
including you.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.962
Okay, but isn't speed the
most important thing here?

06:34.995 --> 06:37.498
I'm flight lead.
I'm calling it.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.167
No fast-rope.
We're landing here.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.137
That's the plan.
Discussion over.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.441
Lima Charlie, sir.
Understood.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.782
You wanted to see me.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.750
Yes. Close the door.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.918
Please.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.494
I know we don't always
see eye to eye.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.896
But something's been
bothering me,

07:08.929 --> 07:11.465
and, for once, you are
the right person to talk to.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.733
Oh, gosh,
aren't I flattered.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.202
This situation with Richard.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.237
The idea that he went
rogue in Somalia

07:17.270 --> 07:18.906
and set up Goundry
as the fall guy

07:18.939 --> 07:21.041
and did it all on his own.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.612
Now, I only met him
a few times,

07:24.645 --> 07:27.214
but Richard seemed like
a man who followed orders.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.882
I'd say that's true.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.584
Raises the question,

07:30.618 --> 07:32.786
could someone higher up
have been involved, too?

07:32.820 --> 07:34.988
Which brings me
to Springer Mountain.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.757
The Agency sniper
was given orders

07:36.790 --> 07:38.125
to wound Goundry,
not kill him.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.827
Yeah, I remember vividly.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.961
I looked into it.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.696
The sniper had an
excellent record.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.665
It is highly unlikely
he would miss his mark.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.799
It can happen.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.234
What are you
suggesting right now,

07:47.267 --> 07:49.002
that he was, what,
given orders to kill Goundry?

07:49.036 --> 07:50.938
It's crossed my mind.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.006
That is a very serious
allegation.

07:53.040 --> 07:57.545
Look... the Agency hasn't
been forthcoming with me

07:57.578 --> 07:59.680
throughout this operation,
and I've gotten a sense,

07:59.713 --> 08:02.249
lately, that Magnus has kept
you in the dark on some things

08:02.282 --> 08:03.751
as well.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.252
You're not wrong.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.854
So maybe you could get us
both some answers.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.824
Of course, answers only matter
if they come with proof.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.593
Look, I have been
reprimanded in the past

08:12.626 --> 08:13.727
for not staying in my lane.

08:13.761 --> 08:14.862
I-I don't need that again.

08:14.895 --> 08:19.199
Did you pledge an oath
to your job...

08:19.232 --> 08:20.734
or to your country?

08:26.774 --> 08:30.243
JESS: Max could not sleep
at my parents'.

08:30.277 --> 08:33.781
I think he needed
to hear the helos--

08:33.814 --> 08:35.282
like white noise
or something.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.884
You know, I kind of get that.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.820
We needed to get back
into a routine anyways.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.755
I had to take a leave
of absence from work

08:41.789 --> 08:43.791
when Jimmy went missing.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.827
Everything stopped.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.261
Except the bills.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.963
I need to start
teaching again.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.799
I don't mean to pry,

08:51.832 --> 08:53.667
but I thought you were
good on savings.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.869
It's all out.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.305
Except for the Tokyo fund.

08:58.338 --> 09:01.141
It's um, sort of
this dream trip

09:01.174 --> 09:03.877
that Jimmy and I had...
have.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.013
I can't take money
out of that account.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.881
It'd be like giving up.

09:07.915 --> 09:11.051
Let me know if there's
anything I can do.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.887
You can help me figure out
how to get everyone

09:13.921 --> 09:15.188
to stop hating me.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.158
It's just gonna be
a matter of time, Jess.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.761
Everyone's on edge lately.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.030
Darzi just got back,
he's on convalescent leave.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.732
He's in bad shape.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.833
He almost lost his leg.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.804
I need to stop by there

09:30.838 --> 09:32.239
and thank him for
everything he's done

09:32.272 --> 09:34.908
to try and help
bring Jimmy back.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.778
You, too.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.913
Look, I know how hard
you have been working.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.214
You look exhausted, Nora.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.985
Ian and I broke up.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.221
The last time I saw you,
you were moving in together.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.957
Yeah, well, things changed.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.692
You told him the secret

09:51.725 --> 09:53.226
that you've been
struggling with.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.862
And he didn't take it
very well.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.263
It's not just the secret.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.131
It's who I was
keeping it with.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.201
It's Gallo, right?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.636
Is there something
between you two?

10:02.670 --> 10:04.071
Because you can tell me.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.208
We've just been through
a lot together.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.844
If there's something real,
I don't know.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.180
Well, do you want
to find out?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.916
We are in the same
chain of command.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.086
That is off the table.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.198
This is Renegade One-Two.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.834
We're approaching
the rehearsal course.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.402
HASKINS: Your Little Bird
support has just engaged

10:35.435 --> 10:36.904
the anti-aircraft installation.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.939
The target is eliminated.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.240
Set the clock,
two minutes.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.042
HASKINS:
Renegade One-Two,

10:42.075 --> 10:45.078
Renegade One-One is taking enemy
fire. They need your support.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.313
Little Birds are still
a klick away.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.314
I have the controls.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.882
MADANI:
You have the controls.

10:48.916 --> 10:49.883
Head on a swivel, Cho.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.318
Scanning my sector, sir.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.388
There's the shooter, right side.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.924
Banking right.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.425
Getting our gunner in position.

11:03.030 --> 11:03.997
Target down.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.033
Nice work, Cho.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.069
Anchor Zero-Six, we're
approaching the objective.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.247
Go, go, go, go, go!

11:40.100 --> 11:42.970
One minute, 55 seconds.
Made it.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.239
Come on. You're not still
upset about before?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.008
I'm not upset.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.342
I'm worried.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.244
We made it in time, sure, but...

11:51.278 --> 11:53.146
not a lot of room for error.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.394
The good Lieutenant here is
gonna be helping us track down

12:07.427 --> 12:09.062
this potential dirty
bomb. Take a seat.

12:09.096 --> 12:13.100
Always a pleasure to have you
on board, Porter. Get cozy.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.936
Oh, sorry.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.808
Ooh, who's Olivia Benning?

12:20.841 --> 12:23.076
She helped us with
the chatter translations.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.177
MAGNUS:
Oh...

12:24.211 --> 12:25.412
the Professor.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.281
She had an "I know something
you don't" vibe; I enjoyed it.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.151
Oh, great. Let me get you
up to speed, Lieutenant.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.419
So based on some
chatter between Khalid

12:32.452 --> 12:34.187
and a known
ISIS associate,

12:34.221 --> 12:35.856
we believe the uranium arrived
via container ship

12:35.889 --> 12:38.291
at a U.S. port last Tuesday.
But now that it is here...

12:38.325 --> 12:40.560
Obviously, it's gonna be harder
to track since we are barred

12:40.593 --> 12:42.062
from listening to
domestic chatter.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.231
MAGNUS: Well, that's the
official line, sure.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.834
Check this out.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.871
We can do

12:50.904 --> 12:54.141
a keyword search
of domestic phone calls

12:54.174 --> 12:55.809
by region.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.577
Pretty amazing, huh?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.113
You sure I should
be seeing this?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.049
Well, I'm just showing you
the ropes, Porter,

13:02.082 --> 13:03.550
I'm not giving you
the password.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.085
I trust you.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.055
Assessing whom to trust
is pretty much

13:08.088 --> 13:09.422
my job description.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.895
Hey, good work, y'all.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.263
We were rock steady out there,

13:16.296 --> 13:17.430
even with the colonel's
curveballs.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.600
Hey, my team's wrecked.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.369
Even the CIA asshats.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.104
Altitude's gonna be a lot
higher in the real thing.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.906
We're gonna be wiped by the
time we get to that bunker.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.975
So you'll suck it up
and drive on

13:28.008 --> 13:29.009
like you always do.
That why

13:29.042 --> 13:31.044
you became a pilot?
So you could sit your butt

13:31.078 --> 13:32.545
in the seat while we go out
and do the real work?

13:32.579 --> 13:34.047
That's enough,
Staff Sergeant.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.283
You're unbelievable.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.251
I'll go talk to him.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.352
Night.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.954
Night, Sergeant.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.257
Dude's got a serious
chip on his shoulder.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.993
How about us?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.227
We good?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.528
Yes, sir.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.097
You don't have to do that.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.999
Don't have to say "sir"

13:52.032 --> 13:53.366
when it's just us.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.136
You don't get to pull rank
on me one day

13:56.169 --> 13:57.938
and then pretend
it doesn't matter the next.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.407
Look, we both know
our relationship

14:00.440 --> 14:03.210
has some... blurry lines.

14:03.243 --> 14:07.080
Well, maybe it's time we admit
that's a problem, too.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.520
Hey, I was just about
to come find you.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.023
We got a hit.
Could be our bomber.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.259
Name showed up
multiple times in chatter.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.562
Known radical sympathies
and a history of travel

14:55.595 --> 14:57.664
to terrorist states.
He lives 90 minutes away.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.933
Yep. Let's go.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.208
I got you, ma'am.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.078
Thank you, Sergeant.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.249
Ma'am, can I be
upfront with you?

15:16.283 --> 15:19.386
Sure.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.688
Coogan's got a right
to be pissed.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.256
His guys, they don't know

15:23.290 --> 15:25.125
what they'll be up against
in that bunker,

15:25.158 --> 15:27.027
and if they're exhausted
before they even get there,

15:27.060 --> 15:28.962
it's an issue.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.598
: It's the only plan
that isn't crazy risky.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.633
Okay, so what's the other plan?

15:33.666 --> 15:35.702
We hover.

15:35.735 --> 15:39.606
Delta guys fast-rope down.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.374
Okay. What about
the power lines?

15:41.408 --> 15:43.043
That's the crazy risky part.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.178
Captain Gallo shot it down
the second he heard it.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.180
I still think we could do it.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.681
Well, you should go
to Colonel Haskins.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.018
If it's best for the mission,
he'll want to hear it.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.519
It's seriously disrespectful

15:52.552 --> 15:54.387
to go over Gallo's head
like that.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.688
And for now,

15:55.722 --> 15:57.524
we have a pretty good
working relationship.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.426
Okay, well,
guys never worry

15:59.459 --> 16:00.660
about being
disrespectful.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.362
They just say what's
on their mind.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.066
Yeah, but Gallo's
also a flight leader.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.135
So if he says we
got to be cautious,

16:08.168 --> 16:09.269
then that's what we do.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.738
Okay, well, all due respect,

16:11.771 --> 16:14.041
did you get where you are
by being cautious?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.509
Come here!

16:49.542 --> 16:51.344
High speed!

16:51.378 --> 16:52.779
Double-time!

16:56.549 --> 16:57.617
You barely made it.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.119
Roger that, Sergeant.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.453
But I did.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.389
You took the ridge.
We cut that off the course

17:02.422 --> 17:04.357
because last rotation,
a soldier fell,

17:04.391 --> 17:06.393
and broke his arm.
I knew if I didn't
make it in time,

17:06.426 --> 17:08.428
I wouldn't pass the course.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.430
The ridge was the only way.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.665
I plan on graduating here
tomorrow with my maroon beret

17:12.699 --> 17:14.367
and becoming
a Shadow Raider, sir.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.836
Is that all you care about?
Wearing the maroon beret?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.439
Is that the only reason
you're here, 543?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.608
'Cause it looks cute
with your outfit?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.376
No, sir!

17:23.410 --> 17:26.513
I'm here because I want to be
the best at what I do.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.149
And if there was a wounded
soldier on that ridge,

17:29.182 --> 17:30.783
I wouldn't be careful,

17:30.817 --> 17:33.620
I would embrace the suck
and I would go get him.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.388
We're done here, 543.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.356
Fall out.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.457
Sir.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.625
GALLO:
543.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.428
Miss... "Madani."

17:42.495 --> 17:44.497
You know what this means, right?

17:45.498 --> 17:48.268
Yeah, I didn't follow orders.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.702
So they're failing me
on the course.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.870
Nope.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.472
You passed.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.141
With flying colors.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.109
What?
It's kind of a...

17:56.143 --> 17:58.111
test within a test
on this one.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.480
You choosing to take
the faster course on the ridge

18:00.513 --> 18:03.383
showed you were willing to risk
whatever it took for this.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.252
That's what we need
in a Shadow Raider.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.587
Looks like we're gonna have
our first female pilot.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.224
:
Hooah.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.361
Sir?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.196
Well, come on.
Give me a fist bump, Madani.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.645
Another one, ma'am?

18:32.679 --> 18:34.547
No.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.582
You're right.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.719
I got to go talk to the colonel.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.831
Mrs. Kam brought you
some gifts.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.734
We appreciate it.
It is the least I could do,

18:54.767 --> 18:56.469
Sergeant.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.572
I cannot begin to thank you

18:59.606 --> 19:02.575
for everything that
you have sacrificed

19:02.609 --> 19:04.677
to help bring
my husband home.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.713
I know how difficult
it can be...
MRS. DARZI: Yeah.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.381
It's more difficult now.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.183
What you did has

19:10.217 --> 19:12.185
compromised everyone.
Baby, please.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.523
Thank you, Ms. Kam.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.691
But I'm just
doing my job.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.695
Okay, busted leg or not,
I am still a Shadow Raider.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.900
And, babe, I promise
I'm gonna get us out of this.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.705
I just wanted to help
welcome you home,

19:32.739 --> 19:35.242
and let you know
how grateful I am.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.543
I'll get out of your hair now.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.810
I'm gonna go, too.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.912
I'll call you later.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.563
Ms. Haskins...

19:56.596 --> 19:57.930
What was he talking about
in there?

19:57.964 --> 20:00.933
They're behind
on their mortgage payments.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.602
They were already struggling,

20:02.635 --> 20:04.871
and things got worse
after he got injured.

20:04.904 --> 20:08.241
Mrs. Darzi quit her job to be
in Germany while he rehabbed.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.543
If you're in debt, you can lose
your security clearance.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.246
Because debt means
you can be compromised.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.883
Without clearance, he would
have to leave Special Ops.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.551
Isn't there something
that Colonel Haskins can do?

20:18.585 --> 20:19.786
That's above his pay grade.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.688
But there are other ways
that we can help.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.456
I'm pulling together donations

20:23.490 --> 20:25.925
to help cover their debt and
get them back on their feet.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.796
I don't know if I can
raise enough, but I'm trying.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.605
You're quiet.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.045
Frankly, sir,
I've been having a hard time

20:46.078 --> 20:47.980
processing what Richard did.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.882
Going rogue like that.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.918
Yeah, it is confounding.
Yeah, to say the least.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.320
Mm-hmm.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.721
I just don't understand why.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.756
Money can be very tempting.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.594
When do you think
he made the decision?

21:01.628 --> 21:03.630
Do you think he'd been
planning it from the start,

21:03.663 --> 21:05.332
or did something turn him?

21:05.365 --> 21:06.899
You know, we're in
the middle of an operation here.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.736
Why are we taking a deep dive
into Richard's psyche?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.838
He was working out of Langley
the whole time.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.706
There must have been signs
of this happening.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.508
You didn't see any, did you?

21:15.542 --> 21:17.810
No, but we have
different jobs.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.679
And like you told
Lieutenant Porter,

21:19.712 --> 21:21.047
yours is knowing who to trust.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.749
What are you getting at?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.784
I don't understand how
you could have missed this.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.092
You'll recall that
we had a conversation,

21:33.125 --> 21:34.727
you and I, a few
weeks back.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.696
When I was given your
e-mails and learned

21:36.729 --> 21:38.698
that you were having
Madani and Gallo followed,

21:38.731 --> 21:41.801
I explained that your focus
was in the wrong place.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.371
Now I am telling
you that again

21:44.404 --> 21:45.705
for the last time.

21:45.738 --> 21:50.577
Your job is to ask the
questions I tell you to ask.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.445
You cross that
line again,

21:52.479 --> 21:53.880
and there will be consequences.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.523
Now... let's get back to work.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.762
Right.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.507
The commander.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.477
Take a seat.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.379
I'd like to commend you all

22:26.413 --> 22:28.848
on your hard work
in yesterday's rehearsal, but

22:28.881 --> 22:32.885
I would not be doing my job if
I didn't consider all plans, so,

22:32.919 --> 22:35.121
we will be rehearsing
another one today,

22:35.154 --> 22:39.392
after which I'll make a decision
on which to use in the field.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.861
Ms. Madani?

22:45.097 --> 22:48.535
Instead of landing, we'll be
conducting a fast-rope op.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.871
There's enough room for
one Black Hawk helicopter

22:51.904 --> 22:53.973
to maneuver into position
between these power lines.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.142
So, Renegade One-Two
will go first,

22:56.175 --> 22:58.778
ground team will then
fast-rope down,

22:58.811 --> 23:01.414
and we'll clear the way
for One-One to do the same.

23:01.448 --> 23:05.485
This plan will save us time
and you, energy.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.437
Looks like you beat
us here, Porter.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.906
Just arrived.
There's no sign of our suspect.

23:26.939 --> 23:27.907
But he's our guy,
all right.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.842
The house is filled
with bomb-making materials.

23:29.876 --> 23:30.910
All right, let's take a look.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.513
You'll need to leave all
electronic devices out here.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.514
It's a safety
precaution.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.082
Lot of flammable
chemicals inside.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.552
Who's first?

24:02.842 --> 24:04.844
Go ahead, Lieutenant Porter.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.480
I'm right behind you.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.975
This is a homey place.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.045
What was that outside?

24:39.078 --> 24:40.680
Before the metal detector?

24:40.713 --> 24:43.249
I don't know what you're
talking about. Excuse me.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.617
Hey.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.921
Let's get to work. We're looking
for anything that can tell us

24:48.955 --> 24:51.190
where this guy is,
or where he might be targeting.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.709
We're almost at
the objective.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.580
Do you want to talk about
this before we get there?

25:13.613 --> 25:18.284
Sure. Let's talk about why you
went over my head to Haskins.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.688
Well, no. I talked to you first,
and you weren't open to my plan.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.156
I listened.
We discussed.

25:24.190 --> 25:27.560
No, you pulled rank, and
then the discussion was over.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.531
HASKINS:
The Little Birds just took out
the anti-aircraft.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.638
You have the controls.
I have the controls.

25:38.671 --> 25:41.641
All right, we're all
locked in back here.
Let's do this.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.275
Watch it, four o'clock!
I got it.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.777
HASKINS:
Renegade One-Two,

25:44.811 --> 25:46.646
your stability
augmentation has failed.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.615
Shut it off.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.583
That's a rough one.
I've still got it.

25:55.822 --> 25:58.124
* Do you wanna go?

25:58.157 --> 26:01.628
* Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go? *

26:01.661 --> 26:03.295
* Do you wanna go?

26:03.329 --> 26:05.331
* Train ride

26:06.398 --> 26:08.735
* Let's get outta here

26:09.936 --> 26:12.104
* Let's leave town

26:14.106 --> 26:16.242
* Let's get outta here

26:16.275 --> 26:19.211
* Let's fall down, oh...

26:19.245 --> 26:20.647
Okay, we're in place.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.648
Nice work, Madani.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.750
Deploy ropes.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.687
Go.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.189
* I'm reaching out

26:30.222 --> 26:33.225
* I'm reaching

26:33.259 --> 26:39.231
* Oh, love...

26:42.835 --> 26:44.637
* Oh, love...

26:46.839 --> 26:49.676
* I want to reach out

26:49.709 --> 26:53.846
* Arms are falling
to the side... *

26:53.880 --> 26:55.081
One minute, 20 seconds.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.949
Well done.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.819
Both scenarios were well
thought out, but speed is key,

26:59.852 --> 27:01.788
and Ms. Madani's plan delivered.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.990
We will be conducting the
fast-rope op for our mission.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.859
Roger that, sir.

27:17.436 --> 27:20.840
Hey, we need to get past this
before we deploy.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.842
Nothing to get past.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.777
I did what was best
for the mission.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.746
That's all we should be
thinking about right now.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.414
That is all I'm
thinking about.
Really?

27:28.447 --> 27:30.717
Because it feels like all these
decisions keep getting muddied

27:30.750 --> 27:32.885
with the personal crap,
and that worries me.

27:32.919 --> 27:34.921
We can't do this here.

27:38.925 --> 27:41.794
Hey, we have a problem.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.765
I heard. The bomber's
disappeared.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.199
Yeah, we're working
on finding him,

27:47.233 --> 27:49.869
but that's not why I'm here.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.872
I wired myself today, hoping
I would get answers from Magnus.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.775
And did you?
No, but he threatened me
if I didn't stop trying.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.343
I have never seen him
like that before.

27:57.376 --> 28:00.279
Doesn't sound like someone
with nothing to hide.
No.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.718
I think Lieutenant Porter
saw the bug,

28:05.752 --> 28:08.187
and I think
he might have told.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.489
Excuse me, sir. Director Magnus
asked to see you.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.792
Both of you.

28:24.203 --> 28:27.139
Thank you
for coming.

28:27.173 --> 28:31.110
Earlier today,
Officer Thea suggested

28:31.143 --> 28:34.313
that I might have been aware
of Richard's rogue activities.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.148
In case either of you
share this concern,

28:36.182 --> 28:37.850
I would like to set
the record straight.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.987
I had no idea.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.757
And, frankly,
that is humiliating.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.859
As the Director
of Special Activities,

28:46.893 --> 28:48.928
I had lost command and control
over one of my own,

28:48.961 --> 28:50.863
and when confronted with that,
I was harsher

28:50.897 --> 28:52.331
than I should have been.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.933
Ego. Forgive me.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.868
I have dedicated my life

28:55.902 --> 28:59.338
to my country,
and to have that questioned

28:59.371 --> 29:00.940
was difficult.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.541
An investigation
has been launched

29:02.574 --> 29:05.511
into Richard's actions at
the highest level of the Agency.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.847
I assure you we will not rest

29:07.880 --> 29:10.149
until we understand
how this happened.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.984
I'm glad to hear that, sir.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.953
I also accept
full responsibility

29:13.986 --> 29:15.955
for my sniper's mistake
on Springer Mountain.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.990
He has been suspended,
effective immediately.

29:18.024 --> 29:21.227
I will let my team know.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.129
Sorry.
MAGNUS: No...

29:23.162 --> 29:24.196
go ahead and take it, Porter.

29:25.497 --> 29:28.234
Hello?

29:28.267 --> 29:30.436
Well, we have a mission
to fly

29:30.469 --> 29:32.939
and a bomber to catch,

29:32.972 --> 29:34.974
so let's get back to work.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.980
Mm.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.451
Maybe it really is
that simple.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.486
We are all on edge lately.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.288
It's hard to know
what to believe anymore.

29:52.859 --> 29:55.027
Okay, I will be there.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.831
Yeah.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.134
Everything okay, Lieutenant?

30:02.168 --> 30:03.970
A source of mine says
she wanted to meet up.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.505
Ma'am.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.009
I know what that was.

30:10.042 --> 30:12.044
What you took off
your collar.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.346
Look...

30:14.380 --> 30:17.383
I'm happy to leave it
as a need-to-know,

30:17.416 --> 30:19.451
as long as I can trust
that we are working

30:19.485 --> 30:20.887
toward the same goals here.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.055
We took the same oath,
Lieutenant--

30:23.089 --> 30:24.323
to defend our country.

30:24.356 --> 30:27.226
I am doing everything
that I can to uphold it.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.982
Hey, Coogan,
you got a sec?

30:51.017 --> 30:53.285
I guess.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.621
Look, I know you and I
aren't always singing

30:55.654 --> 30:56.555
from the same hymn sheet...

30:56.588 --> 31:00.392
Yeah, that's the
understatement of the year.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.561
I want to be good with you
before we go on this mission.

31:02.594 --> 31:05.231
I think we should talk
about what started

31:05.264 --> 31:08.567
this tension between us.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.169
Rachel.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.473
That was years ago,
Gallo.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.675
That's all the more
reason to let it go.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.211
We both cared about her.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.612
We both lost her.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.315
She wouldn't want us
fighting each other here

31:23.349 --> 31:26.085
when we've got plenty of
bad guys to fight out there.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.621
You're right.
I'm trying.

31:29.655 --> 31:30.990
You could have fooled me.

31:31.023 --> 31:34.193
Look, I went dark
after Rachel.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.661
She dumped me for you-- that
didn't really sit well with me.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.529
I wasn't making
a play, man.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.932
That was her decision.
I know.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.403
When she died
out there, man,

31:44.436 --> 31:45.671
her and I still
weren't speaking,

31:45.704 --> 31:48.074
and, uh...

31:48.107 --> 31:51.377
I got a lot of big
regrets with that.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.345
Guess I just wrapped you up
with the rest of it in my head.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.181
I get it.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.283
I've been working
on my anger, you know.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.952
Listening to a lot
of mindfulness podcasts.

31:59.986 --> 32:02.188
For real?
Yeah.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.225
You know Rachel's the one
that encouraged me

32:06.258 --> 32:08.627
to become a pilot?

32:08.660 --> 32:11.998
Made me put in my packet when
we were still in Kandahar.

32:13.632 --> 32:14.633
She pushed me, man.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.368
Yeah.

32:16.402 --> 32:19.238
I've never felt that way
about anybody else.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.144
All right, good talk.
We good?

32:25.177 --> 32:27.113
Yeah, yeah, good.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.015
What do you say
we get out there,

32:29.048 --> 32:31.217
light Khalid's ass up,
bring Sergeant Kam home--

32:31.250 --> 32:32.384
that sound good
to you, sir?

32:32.418 --> 32:34.186
All the way.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.523
Airborne.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.066
Colonel.
Mrs. Kam.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.368
I stopped by because
my wife told me

32:49.401 --> 32:51.170
you gave her
a sizeable check

32:51.203 --> 32:53.639
to help the Darzis
with their mortgage.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.608
I told her I wanted it
to be anonymous.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.245
You've met my wife.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.347
It's very generous,
Mrs. Kam.

33:01.380 --> 33:04.016
We had some money
set aside, so...

33:04.050 --> 33:06.085
I know what Jimmy makes.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.320
Must've taken a while
to save that up.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.390
This was more important.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.792
But I really did not want
anybody to know.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.762
Well, I think maybe
it's good they do...

33:16.795 --> 33:18.797
given everything
that's happened.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.167
I just wanted
to do something

33:21.200 --> 33:23.435
where right and wrong
was clear for a change.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.304
I know.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.607
And I'd like to show
my appreciation.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.643
We have a group deploying...

33:31.677 --> 33:35.081
on a very important
mission tomorrow morning.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.582
I'd like you and Max to
join me on the flight line

33:36.615 --> 33:38.016
to see them off.

33:39.285 --> 33:41.287
Are we even allowed?

33:41.320 --> 33:43.322
As my honorary guests
you would be.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.325
Thank you, sir.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.194
We will be there.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.630
PORTER: Nice place. So,
what did you ask me here for?

33:51.663 --> 33:54.800
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about

33:54.833 --> 33:56.635
those documents
you had me translate.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.505
They talked about
a shipment to the U.S.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.173
Something dangerous.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.308
That much I could tell.

34:02.341 --> 34:03.775
It's all classified.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.212
I thought you
understood that.
I just want to know--

34:06.245 --> 34:10.182
is there anything
I should be worried about?

34:10.216 --> 34:12.684
No.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.121
Okay. Thank you.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.759
There's... another reason
I called you, too.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.130
I wanted a chance
to get to know you

34:24.163 --> 34:25.764
out of uniform.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.833
Not what I meant.

34:29.468 --> 34:30.836
I think I'm being a little
too honest right now.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.372
It's fine.
I guess I didn't know
how else to ask.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.442
I'm flattered.
Thank God.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.744
Because, I mean, I don't know
if you're single or...

34:38.777 --> 34:40.846
I am.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.448
And...

34:42.481 --> 34:44.116
What?

34:44.150 --> 34:47.786
I just appreciate
you being honest.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.821
I haven't had a lot of
that in my life lately.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.669
It's a little late to
drop by, don't you think?

35:03.702 --> 35:05.304
We deploy at 0500.
Yeah.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.139
And we need to get square
with each other before that.

35:07.173 --> 35:08.574
I'm getting kind of
tired of you

35:08.607 --> 35:10.409
just coming over here
whenever you feel like it.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.144
You need to think
about the rules.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.679
Like no fraternizing...

35:13.712 --> 35:16.348
Really? After everything
we've been through,

35:16.382 --> 35:17.749
you're gonna pull that out?

35:17.783 --> 35:19.218
You know what?
You're right.

35:19.251 --> 35:21.487
All these blurred lines
are a problem.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.689
Makes you think you don't
need to respect the rank.

35:23.722 --> 35:24.890
I'll respect it
when it's earned.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.525
Okay.
I need to know

35:26.558 --> 35:27.859
that when we're
out there in the field,

35:27.893 --> 35:29.395
we're gonna take
the risks we need

35:29.428 --> 35:30.762
and make decisions
with a clear head,

35:30.796 --> 35:31.863
without all this involved.

35:31.897 --> 35:32.898
You know what,
I just don't think

35:32.931 --> 35:34.433
either of us can promise that.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.667
Once we crossed that line,

35:35.701 --> 35:36.735
can't put that back
in the bottle.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.604
Yeah, but we need to try.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.339
You know what,
this is pointless.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.774
Just... go home.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.676
We're not done.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.612
Look...
Go home.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.714
That's an order, Nora.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.883
I'm not going anywhere...

35:51.917 --> 35:53.652
Leland.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.922
You know I hate that name.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.557
That's why I used it.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.229
Get... out.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.230
* 'Cause I don't always
show it *

36:04.263 --> 36:05.364
* But you are

36:05.397 --> 36:07.299
* The most important thing

36:07.333 --> 36:10.669
* In my life...

36:29.255 --> 36:30.956
Let's not be soldiers
right now, okay?

36:30.989 --> 36:32.891
Really?

36:32.924 --> 36:34.426
Shut up.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.471
* It's just one more drink

36:45.504 --> 36:48.006
* At least I think

36:48.039 --> 36:53.545
* That's what I uttered
over an hour ago *

36:53.579 --> 36:55.381
* Selfish blunder

36:55.414 --> 36:57.483
* Crack of thunder

36:57.516 --> 36:59.551
* I should've just
followed you *

36:59.585 --> 37:01.487
* Step by step

37:01.520 --> 37:03.422
* To the

37:03.455 --> 37:06.792
* Stage door.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.266
PORTER:
I understand that you see

37:14.300 --> 37:16.402
a whole different side
of things. It's...

37:16.435 --> 37:18.270
OLIVIA: It's the local
versus global, I suppose.

37:18.304 --> 37:19.971
Yeah.
Of course I understand

37:20.005 --> 37:21.006
it's a troubled part
of the world,

37:21.039 --> 37:24.343
and military intervention
is necessary sometimes.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.578
But the impact it can have
on the population

37:26.612 --> 37:28.314
can be brutal.
It is.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.981
Take my translator,
Faduma.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.283
I saw her picture
in your office.

37:31.317 --> 37:33.018
She was killed
earlier this year.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.754
A CIA drone strike
took out half her village.

37:35.787 --> 37:38.390
I just can't help
but think sometimes

37:38.424 --> 37:39.358
it could have been me.

37:39.391 --> 37:42.461
Had I been born in Somalia,
and she in London,

37:42.494 --> 37:45.364
I'd be dead, and she'd be
sitting here with you.

37:45.397 --> 37:48.367
That's the senseless
world we live in.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.002
It is.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.372
It's hard to process
that kind of loss.

37:53.405 --> 37:56.908
My dad was in the
World Trade Center in '93.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.378
I... I barely remember it.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.547
Oh... I turned things
a little dark, didn't I?

38:02.648 --> 38:04.049
I didn't mean to.
It's okay.

38:04.082 --> 38:06.385
It's okay, look,
I'm enjoying this.

38:06.418 --> 38:10.356
Talking with, uh, you.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.757
I think that I'm
a little bit drunk.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.091
So am I.
Yeah.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.993
Yeah...

38:16.562 --> 38:18.096
You want to get out of here?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.831
I live, like,
three blocks away.

38:24.436 --> 38:25.637
I'm having a great time,

38:25.671 --> 38:30.476
but I... just got
out of something.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.344
My head is not
in the right place.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.348
But we should do this
again sometime.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.818
I'd like that.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.033
I came here to
get some clarity.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.803
Total fail.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.005
Well, takes two
to tango.

39:00.038 --> 39:03.509
Or, you know, do this.

39:05.477 --> 39:08.013
So what happens now?

39:08.046 --> 39:11.983
I have no idea.

39:18.624 --> 39:19.858
We deploy in an hour.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.028
I have to go home.

39:30.101 --> 39:35.140
* Standing here
I'm living proof *

39:35.173 --> 39:37.443
* When you were here

39:37.476 --> 39:40.011
* You did something good

39:40.045 --> 39:42.514
* I don't have to say

39:42.548 --> 39:45.451
* That you made your mistakes

39:45.484 --> 39:47.419
* They will all be healed

39:47.453 --> 39:49.988
* In a higher place

39:52.591 --> 39:57.195
* Oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh *

39:57.228 --> 40:00.532
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

40:00.566 --> 40:05.437
* People say that
I walk like you... *

40:05.471 --> 40:06.972
Here you go.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.940
You deserve that.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.542
Thanks.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.177
* I don't have to try

40:12.210 --> 40:15.113
* To be good or be kind

40:15.146 --> 40:17.783
* That's a part of you

40:17.816 --> 40:21.186
* That I keep inside

40:21.219 --> 40:22.721
* Thought I'd found

40:22.754 --> 40:26.191
* What there was to find

40:26.224 --> 40:28.827
* I never looked for you

40:28.860 --> 40:31.029
* But I, I, I

40:31.062 --> 40:35.667
* Saw your face
when I couldn't see *

40:35.701 --> 40:37.836
* Heard your thoughts

40:37.869 --> 40:39.137
Hey.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.506
* In my memory...

40:40.539 --> 40:42.173
Hey.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.610
I know things have
changed between us,

40:44.643 --> 40:47.546
but I... I still
care about you.

40:48.714 --> 40:52.584
A lot.

40:52.618 --> 40:53.585
I didn't want you going up
without knowing that.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.988
Thank you.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.757
* Higher high

40:58.790 --> 41:01.627
Me, too.

41:01.660 --> 41:06.898
* My higher high.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.105
Thea, I didn't realize
you were coming for this.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.241
I'm not here for the sendoff.
I've been going through evidence

41:16.274 --> 41:18.076
from the bomber's apartment,
and I found this.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.845
Floor plans for an event center
in Atlanta.

41:19.878 --> 41:20.979
You think that's
his target?

41:21.012 --> 41:22.681
They're having a huge
international

41:22.714 --> 41:24.015
affairs conference
this Saturday.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.017
Where Magnus is speaking.
A lot of dignitaries

41:26.051 --> 41:26.985
are gonna be attending--
I'm willing to bet

41:27.018 --> 41:28.119
so will our bomber.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.488
My mom is gonna be there.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.874
You left these at my place.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.177
Figured you'd bring 'em.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.747
Now we go get Jimmy.

41:55.781 --> 41:57.916
Yeah.
