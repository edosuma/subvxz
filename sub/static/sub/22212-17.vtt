00:08.258 --> 00:11.553
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:11.636 --> 00:16.099
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
I'm just obsessing over this shady man.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.685
His car was outside our house
for two days.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.020
Jughead and I took care of it.

00:21.104 --> 00:25.191
Let me stay here. I can't stay
in the same house as Chic anymore.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.694
You wanna turn the town into a prison.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.821
We are leaving now.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.698
-Come on, Archie.
-I'm staying.

00:31.781 --> 00:37.162
You think a prison is bad for Riverdale,
but the Lodges have thought this through.

00:37.245 --> 00:41.583
I won't support Hiram and Hermione.
I'm gonna run for mayor against them.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.002
I'm running for student body president.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.087
-Be my co-president.
-Okay.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.089
-I'm not a quitter.
<i>Me neither.</i>

00:48.173 --> 00:50.967
-I wanna be your running mate.
-I'd like that.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.970
First things first. Nana, then Cheryl.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.681
Of course, our house must be put in order.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.099
You've gone mad.

00:58.183 --> 01:01.311
-You leave us no choice.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.481
I'm looking for Cheryl.
-She's gone.

01:04.564 --> 01:08.109
Boarding school in Switzerland.
Don't come here again.

01:09.736 --> 01:13.823
<i>Welcome to the Sisters</i>
<i>of Quiet Mercy. Home for troubled youths.</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:19.954
<i>Where a certain Cheryl Blossom finds</i>
<i>herself more troubled than usual.</i>

01:23.416 --> 01:24.709
It's time, girlie.

01:26.836 --> 01:31.174
<i>With nary a thing to look</i>
<i>forward to, except for movie nights,</i> <i>during which times Cheryl would imagine</i>
<i>what her friends might be doing.</i>

01:40.099 --> 01:42.602
<i>Seems innocent enough,</i>
<i>but look closer.</i>

01:42.685 --> 01:44.103
<i>Hey, Frank, hey, Dick.</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:47.398
<i>We're going to the diner with the girls.</i>
<i>You coming?</i>

01:48.775 --> 01:49.692
<i>We'll catch up.</i>

01:51.027 --> 01:54.697
<i>My, my. What do these seemingly</i>
<i>all</i>

01:58.076 --> 02:01.955
<i>Boy, Frank, that water sure looks great.</i>
<i>Wanna take a dip?</i>

02:02.288 --> 02:05.208
<i>Wish we could,</i>
<i>but I didn't bring swimming trunks.</i>

02:05.291 --> 02:07.961
<i>The boys should have found</i>
<i>another activity,</i>

02:08.044 --> 02:09.754
<i>but instead, they succumbed...</i>

02:10.547 --> 02:12.757
<i>Then again, maybe we don't need them.</i>

02:13.550 --> 02:16.177
<i>...and were ensnared by deviance.</i>

02:21.099 --> 02:23.101
<i>As Cheryl Blossom withered,</i>

02:23.184 --> 02:26.604
<i>her friends were squaring off</i>
<i>on the most public of stages.</i>

02:27.272 --> 02:32.652
Now, just a reminder that this School Hall
is a PTA-sponsored event.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.280
-Oh! We have our first question.
Yeah.

02:35.363 --> 02:40.076
No offense to the current administration,
but it feels like no one's looking out

02:40.160 --> 02:44.289
for the students being bused in
from the Southside. Will that change?

02:44.372 --> 02:49.043
Absolutely, Sweet Pea. It's our priority.
No one should be marginalized or excluded.

02:49.127 --> 02:53.506
Jughead and I will be representing
all students, North and Southside alike.

02:53.590 --> 02:59.596
-Next question. Yes, Midge.
-My question is for Archie and Veronica.

03:00.305 --> 03:04.601
Your parents will soon be
on opposite sides of the mayoral election.

03:04.684 --> 03:08.271
Won't that negatively affect
your working relationship?

03:08.354 --> 03:10.565
Archie and I adhere to the old maxim:

03:10.648 --> 03:13.776
Politics are never discussed
at the dinner or the cafeteria table.

03:15.486 --> 03:20.325
Veronica and I are on the same page,
including her family's plans for a prison.

03:22.201 --> 03:27.165
In the meantime, we're committed
to improving life at Riverdale High.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.958
More extracurriculars--

03:29.042 --> 03:34.130
Reggie and I agree, except add the fact
that we can, and will, deliver results.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.466
And we're chill, unlike these guys.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.888
<i>Shouldn't we be hobnobbing</i>

03:41.971 --> 03:44.641
No, we have to go
before my mom attacks us.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.643
She's a heat-seeking missile.

03:48.978 --> 03:53.983
-You can't keep dodging her forever.
-Maybe not, but I can try. Let's go.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.319
FP, you should be ashamed.

03:56.402 --> 04:00.406
Letting my sweet, innocent daughter
live in sin in that trailer.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.158
You think I'm a fan of this?

04:02.242 --> 04:07.413
I'm sleeping on a sofa with my son
so your daughter can have his bedroom.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.583
You're doing that?

04:10.667 --> 04:15.296
Look, Alice, take it from a guy
whose son chose being homeless

04:15.380 --> 04:17.590
over living with his old man.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.427
Make things right with her,
before it's too late.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.639
<i>Mary, Fred.</i>

04:24.722 --> 04:28.601
Riverdale is buzzing about you
running against my wife for mayor.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.478
I've lived here my whole life.

04:30.561 --> 04:35.191
Never went to New York or to prison.
There's no one more qualified than me.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.236
Hiram, we're waiting for you
to sign those papers

04:38.319 --> 04:40.822
finalizing Fred's separation
from Lodge Industries.

04:41.072 --> 04:45.743
Huh. Like how we're still waiting for you
to sign the NDA that we sent over.

04:45.827 --> 04:50.999
Now, now, Mom and Dad. There's no need
to become the Montagues and the Capulets.

04:51.082 --> 04:55.461
We were saying, can't this be
a fair fight, no hitting below the belt,

04:55.545 --> 04:58.673
and everyone signing
whatever it is they need to sign?

05:04.178 --> 05:07.348
Mr. and Mrs. Lodge,
you have some unexpected guests.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.520
Lenny. Carl. How are you, fellas?

05:12.854 --> 05:16.232
-We have some business to discuss, Hiram.
-In private.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.860
I'd invite you to my study, but it's late.

05:18.943 --> 05:22.864
Please, Hiram. A few minutes of your time.
Is that so much to ask for?

05:25.992 --> 05:27.452
No. Not at all.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.789
Take Veronica and Hermione upstairs.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.129
-Mr. Lodge--
-It's okay, Archie. Just a friendly visit.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.719
<i>I need to ask a favor, Archie.</i>

05:44.802 --> 05:48.556
Your father is announcing
his run for mayor on Friday.

05:48.639 --> 05:54.353
And his campaign, as you know, is based on
promoting a wholesome view of Riverdale.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.856
The place where he raised his family.

05:58.399 --> 06:03.237
Having us both there, standing with him,
it's an important moment.

06:03.946 --> 06:06.616
Then why isn't Dad asking me himself?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.701
He's a proud guy, your dad,

06:08.785 --> 06:13.581
but I know it'd mean the world to him,
and to me, if you showed up for this.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.711
Mom, of course I'll be there for Dad.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.969
Hey, Chic. Are you hungry?
Do you wanna order a pizza?

06:29.138 --> 06:31.974
Mom, you need to see what they found.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.269
<i>Authorities are searching for witnesses.</i>

06:35.353 --> 06:37.522
<i>Anyone who may have more information</i>

06:37.605 --> 06:40.316
<i>is encouraged</i>
<i>to contact police immediately.</i>

06:40.691 --> 06:44.278
Easy, Alice, hold on.
Turn to Channel 8, right now.

06:47.198 --> 06:51.285
<i>It is not yet known how or when</i>
<i>the car first entered the swamp,</i>

06:51.369 --> 06:54.747
<i>-but foul play has not been ruled out.</i>
-They found it, FP.

06:55.748 --> 06:56.916
They found it.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.970
We should've known better.

07:09.637 --> 07:14.559
I should've known better.
We should've driven that car out of town.

07:14.642 --> 07:19.939
No. You couldn't have known Junkyard Steve
drags the swamp for people's castoffs.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.232
It's dumb luck.

07:21.315 --> 07:25.445
-It's Jones luck, you mean.
-Chic should be here. He brained the guy.

07:25.528 --> 07:29.532
-Don't worry about Chic.
-Normally, I'd disagree. Worry about Chic.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.951
But he doesn't know about the car.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.371
-We wiped the thing clean of prints.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.374
-I think so.
-I'm pretty sure.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.211
-No, we 100 percent were.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.930
If anybody comes asking,
we don't know anything. Don't talk to anyone.
Act like everything's normal.

07:56.267 --> 08:00.146
Including you coming home,
so you're not with a bunch of Serpents.

08:00.229 --> 08:03.357
No. You're not gonna use this
to manipulate me, Mom.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.694
-I come home when Chic leaves.
-Everybody, be cool.

08:06.777 --> 08:11.365
In the unlikely event that something
happens, we batten down the hatches.

08:11.449 --> 08:15.453
Until then, life goes on,
and nobody goes anywhere near that car.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.289
<i>About last night, Archie,</i>

08:18.372 --> 08:22.001
my associates,
Lenny Kowalski and Carl Martin,

08:22.627 --> 08:26.672
my wife's mayoral campaign
is making them anxious.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.133
I thought Mrs. Lodge being mayor
would be good.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.136
Men like Lenny and Carl see this as hubris

08:32.220 --> 08:37.058
that could bring us, and our business,
unwanted attention from the authorities.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.685
I'm having dinner with them tonight.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.606
In the meantime, keep a close eye
on Veronica. Do you understand?

08:43.689 --> 08:50.238
I will. But what if I came with you?
They know me from the poker game.

08:50.321 --> 08:55.743
Andre and Adams will be there, but you do
always find a way to make yourself useful.

08:55.826 --> 09:00.081
I'm trying to get my old crew down,
but they've gone silent on me.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.462
All right. You're in.

09:09.215 --> 09:13.469
You promised us a war,<i> </i>then you're
on stage, sucking up to the Northside?

09:13.553 --> 09:17.181
We need those votes.
It's the only way we can affect change.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.684
Whoever's elected
gets on the school board.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.853
That means we're inside,
they can't silence us.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.648
You and the Northside princess?

09:25.731 --> 09:29.610
Wait, is that why you guys are pissed?
Betty's on our side.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.698
Yeah, I've helped the Serpents
on numerous occasions.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.784
I helped find the Pickens statue's head.

09:36.867 --> 09:41.581
I got Cheryl to testify in court so FP,
your king, could get early parole--

09:41.664 --> 09:44.834
You did all that for your boyfriend,
not the Serpents.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.461
-All right. Take it down, Sweet Pea.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.465
Only a matter of time before she bails
on us, like her mother.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.759
So your objections are about my mom.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.929
Her legacy.
She's an enemy of the Serpent State.

09:57.013 --> 10:00.683
Taking shots at us in <i>The Register</i>.
Blaming us for crimes.

10:00.766 --> 10:04.103
Running with a turncoat's daughter
is a slap in the face,

10:04.186 --> 10:07.898
and for that reason alone,
you're not getting the Serpent vote.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.490
Let's settle this once and for all.

10:16.574 --> 10:20.536
We're both Bulldogs who, like wolves,
support the alpha.

10:20.786 --> 10:25.333
Now, we risk splitting our boys' votes,
which I told Josie I could deliver.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.542
Hence this contest.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.087
Mantle versus Andrews.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.466
Winner gets the Bulldogs' backing.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.222
Give up. You're gonna lose, Andrews.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.558
Same as your dad.

10:48.314 --> 10:52.234
Talk about my dad like that again,
and next time, I break your arm.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.907
<i>What do you mean Cheryl's missing?</i>

10:57.990 --> 11:00.368
Do you remember how paranoid Cheryl was?

11:00.451 --> 11:03.079
Saying her mom and uncle
were out to get her?

11:03.162 --> 11:05.748
-I think they did something to her.

11:05.831 --> 11:10.086
Her mom said they sent her off
to some boarding school in Switzerland.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.214
That's easy to check.
There's only Surval Montreux.

11:13.297 --> 11:17.468
If Cheryl was in the Swiss Alps,
she'd be posting parka selfies.

11:17.551 --> 11:23.099
-Her social media's been dead for days.
-Wait. That's a sure sign of foul play.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.016
Yeah.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.977
-Whatever you need, Toni. I'm in.
-Me, too.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.980
Even if we have to storm Thistlehouse.

11:30.689 --> 11:35.027
I believe I've deduced what's caused
this imbalance in you, Cheryl.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.781
And what would that be, Sister Livingston?

11:38.864 --> 11:42.076
I've spoken to your mother
about your brother Jason,

11:42.785 --> 11:44.537
and how close you were.

11:45.704 --> 11:50.418
So close, in fact, that your Nana would
sometimes mix you up, isn't that right?

11:51.877 --> 11:55.923
She would dress you in Jason's clothes,
and he in yours.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.926
Nana's always been half-blind, Sister.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.761
Cataracts.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.931
But if anything's affected my psyche,

12:04.014 --> 12:07.393
it's the fire hose of abuse directed at me
by my parents.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.771
You've suffered many traumas, it's true,

12:11.355 --> 12:14.859
but that does not excuse
your willful behavior.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.446
Now, you will report
to the undercroft immediately,

12:18.529 --> 12:23.117
where you will undergo physical therapy
until you're ready to listen.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.840
I'm not gonna mince words, Hiram.

12:38.549 --> 12:42.636
Your wife's campaign is risky.
Putting the families in the public eye.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.223
But we understand ours
is a risk-reward business,

12:46.307 --> 12:49.518
and your idea
for a private prison is intriguing.

12:49.977 --> 12:53.856
So, the reward we want for our risk is
a cut of the Riverdale pie.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.608
How's 25 percent sound?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.444
After your cut,
I'd be operating at a loss,

12:58.527 --> 13:02.740
so, Lenny, Carl, respectfully...

13:03.532 --> 13:05.451
I decline your kind offer.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.875
With all due respect, Hiram,
you're all alone here.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.295
Your boys from Montreal, New York,
work for us now.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.255
Who've you got out here

13:19.006 --> 13:22.510
A couple low-level capos
and some zit

13:30.226 --> 13:32.811
Mister Kowalski, Mr. Martin,

13:32.895 --> 13:36.232
respectfully, don't underestimate
Mr. Lodge or me.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.399
Archie.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.611
I rearranged Nick St. Clair's
pretty-boy face for him.

13:40.694 --> 13:44.532
I took care of Poppa Poutine
after he conspired with you, Lenny.

13:44.949 --> 13:49.828
And when some hillbilly threatened
Mr. Lodge's daughter, I did the same.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.915
So, don't think for a second
that we're defenseless.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.468
You nearly had us there, Red.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.763
Hiram, consider our offer.

14:07.846 --> 14:08.681
Yeah.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.140
In the meantime,

14:10.683 --> 14:14.895
we'll be sticking around Riverdale,
taking in local flavors. Sound good?

14:21.068 --> 14:25.489
-I wasn't gonna let them disrespect you.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.157
Not in our town.

14:27.241 --> 14:31.745
Nevertheless, you fire a warning shot
like that, be ready to back it up.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.626
Good. You're a good boy, Archie.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.138
<i>What do Sweet Pea and Fangs</i>
<i>want from me?</i>

14:49.221 --> 14:52.516
What will it take for them to accept me?
Wear plaid?

14:53.142 --> 14:56.353
Do I need to get a leather jacket
or a snake tattoo?

14:56.437 --> 14:59.815
To be fair, your mother
is Serpent Enemy Number One.

14:59.899 --> 15:04.528
The shady man's car is out there.
We have no idea what's going on with it.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.488
I've been thinking about that.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.868
Our parents told us to act normal
and let sleeping dogs lie...

15:12.786 --> 15:15.122
but riddle me this, what is our normal?

15:17.875 --> 15:18.876
Normal is...

15:20.628 --> 15:24.048
investigating something
when the world tells us we shouldn't.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.134
Pumping our sources for information.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.597
<i>Why do you guys care about this car?</i>

15:31.680 --> 15:34.975
We don't. We care about the environment.

15:35.059 --> 15:40.189
And we're writing about how people use
Swedlow Swamp as a dumping ground.

15:40.272 --> 15:45.110
-The car is just part of a larger story.
-My dad said it was claimed by its owner.

15:47.071 --> 15:51.700
The owner... who's in Riverdale?

15:51.784 --> 15:56.246
Yeah. Now they're trying to figure out
who stole it in the first place.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.506
Has shacking up together
driven you both completely insane?

16:05.589 --> 16:09.843
You didn't think talking to the sheriff's
son was gonna raise red flags?

16:09.927 --> 16:13.889
-Kevin didn't suspect anything.
-At least we know what's going on.

16:13.973 --> 16:18.644
Yeah, Chic's drug dealer stole
someone's car before he ran to our house.

16:18.727 --> 16:22.106
Dwayne didn't have wheels.
He borrowed his girlfriend's.

16:22.189 --> 16:26.026
Someone called the shady man's phone.
She sounded crazy.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.405
But not like there was love lost
between her and Dwayne.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.658
-Could be Darla.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.702
I don't really know her.

16:34.785 --> 16:38.330
Shocker. Gee, Chic, have you
ever been helpful to anyone?

16:38.414 --> 16:41.000
-Enough, Elizabeth.
Stick to the plan.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.795
This has nothing to do with us. Dwayne
stole Darla's car, Darla got it back.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.380
Let's hope it ends there.

16:46.463 --> 16:49.925
And pack your things, Betty.
This honeymoon is over. Over.

16:50.009 --> 16:54.596
Playing house and running around
like loose cannons is beyond the pale.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.767
We don't want Hal to find out.
We don't need him sticking his nose in.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.686
I'll move out.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.356
I'll get a place. It's your house.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.818
Fine. I'll come back home
after Chic's gone.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.863
I'm done with your ultimatums.
You're coming home.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.698
If you don't back me up, FP,

17:12.781 --> 17:15.701
I will tear this trailer apart
with my bare hands.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.046
Fine.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.595
-I'll get my stuff.
-I'll help you pack.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.239
But, foolish girl, what have you done?

17:54.323 --> 17:57.201
You stacked the bags
in the northeast corner,

17:57.284 --> 17:59.578
when I told you the northwest.

17:59.661 --> 18:03.082
No, no. You said--
-Start over.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.876
And next time, listen, child.

18:06.502 --> 18:10.047
You'll never get better
if you don't listen to me.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.678
Now that you've barged your way in,
go ahead, girls.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.222
Ask your questions.

18:18.305 --> 18:21.308
You said Cheryl was away
at some boarding school?

18:22.643 --> 18:26.855
Honestly, I'm not in the habit
of explaining myself to school girls.

18:26.939 --> 18:30.734
Maybe not, Mrs. Blossom,
but you may have heard that my mother...

18:31.902 --> 18:33.904
is dating Sheriff Keller.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.241
If you won't tell us,
then maybe you'll tell him.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.283
All right, then.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.995
The truth is that Cheryl

18:42.579 --> 18:46.291
started exhibiting strange,
deviant behavior,

18:46.375 --> 18:48.919
so, I sent her abroad
to a wellness institute

18:49.002 --> 18:52.756
where they're trying to help her.
You don't have to believe me.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.259
But let me show you something.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.644
-Oh, my God.
-She's drawn dozens like it.

19:06.395 --> 19:10.065
-I don't understand.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.776
Cheryl was obsessed with you.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.195
I was afraid she might hurt you...

19:15.821 --> 19:17.823
or herself, or both.

19:18.407 --> 19:22.327
So, if you'd like me to tell that
to your mother and her boyfriend,

19:22.411 --> 19:26.874
and show them, and the town,
Cheryl's drawings of you,

19:26.957 --> 19:27.916
I'd be happy to.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.587
But hopefully you have the decency
to keep this private.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.134
<i>Josie, wait.</i>

19:37.217 --> 19:39.553
Slow down. We need to regroup.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.764
If what Mrs. Blossom said
is even a bit true,

19:42.848 --> 19:46.894
that means that Cheryl threatened me,
sent me a bloody pig's heart.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.813
I'm out, you guys. I'm done.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.992
Sulk all you want, Betty.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.036
I'm not.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.957
I was gonna see if you'd sign
something for me. A consent form.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.880
Are you trying to get emancipated
because I made you move back?

20:14.963 --> 20:16.798
It's so I can get a tattoo.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.383
A Serpent tattoo.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.347
You have lousy timing, kiddo.

20:24.556 --> 20:28.185
Act normal, right?
Life goes on, doesn't it?

20:28.310 --> 20:32.981
You are not getting a tattoo
just to prove something to your boyfriend.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.817
-I'm practically a Serpent.
-Do not say that.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.321
Do not think I won't find
a tattoo parlor that will do it.

20:42.032 --> 20:42.866
Mom.

20:43.116 --> 20:43.951
Betty.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.745
I was trying to help.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.122
You must be Alice.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.209
And you must be Betty.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.211
Hi, I'm Darla.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.467
Okay. Well...

21:00.676 --> 21:02.594
What about something like, uh...

21:02.719 --> 21:06.974
"I'm about investing in the citizens
of Riverdale, not just profiting."

21:07.057 --> 21:08.934
I like that, Jug. That's great.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.602
-It's simple--
-Dad.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.521
-Hey.
-Jug.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.732
-Oh, Jug's helping me out with the--

21:15.816 --> 21:18.443
Your mother calls it
my announcement address.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.863
I'm not much for speechifying,
but Jug is a great writer.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.826
You need to meet more writers,
Mr. Andrews.

21:27.619 --> 21:31.707
By the way, your mom told me
you'd be stopping by at the announcement.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.874
I appreciate that.

21:36.753 --> 21:41.133
I'm not surprised that deadbeat Dwayne
borrowed my car without asking.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.635
Does it all the time.

21:44.803 --> 21:50.642
What did surprise me was the car
turning up in a swamp in Riverdale.

21:51.935 --> 21:56.648
And just as I was getting ready to head
back to Centerville, Chic called me.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.109
Why would you do that?

21:59.651 --> 22:03.488
He thought he could sniff out
how much I knew. Isn't that right?

22:04.698 --> 22:07.701
But there's no playing a player.
I saw through him.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.082
It's okay. Dwayne was a heel.

22:14.416 --> 22:18.628
I wouldn't be surprised if he stole
my car to pick up some floozy

22:18.712 --> 22:20.589
only to get himself killed.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.263
Like I told Chic...

22:30.015 --> 22:32.934
I don't particularly care
what happened to Dwayne.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.022
I don't see any reason to ask
any questions about him,

22:37.481 --> 22:40.692
especially not if I get
the 10 grand he owes me.

22:41.693 --> 22:46.782
I get that, I'm a happy camper who'll be
out of your lives forever and ever, amen.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.118
If not, well, then...

22:51.995 --> 22:56.750
I might just have to have a long talk
with that handsome sheriff of yours.

22:56.833 --> 23:01.088
-We have nothing to do with that--
-We don't have that money on hand.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.715
But if we get the money,
we're done, right?

23:04.382 --> 23:08.970
-Zip my mouth and throw away the key.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.850
-Okay, we'll make a withdrawal.
Uh-uh.

23:14.559 --> 23:15.644
One of you goes.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.855
Betty, then. Betty will go.

23:20.315 --> 23:23.276
Mom, the bank's not open
until 9 tomorrow morning.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.696
I don't mind waiting. Got any board games?

23:27.864 --> 23:32.077
It's messed up, Ronnie. Me and my dad
don't know how to talk anymore.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.372
You'll work it out. You always do.

23:36.498 --> 23:40.585
And God and Gucci willing,
Cheryl's safe, wherever she is.

23:48.718 --> 23:49.553
Andre?

23:54.891 --> 23:56.434
-Hey!
-Archie, don't!

23:59.604 --> 24:00.438
Oh, my God.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.483
It's all right. It's okay.

24:13.994 --> 24:17.581
Adams? You double-crossing piece of--

24:22.919 --> 24:25.005
Tell your girlfriend's father
to take the deal.

24:35.891 --> 24:39.686
So, God knows how long Adams
has been working against us.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.355
Kowalski and Martin
must have offered him a tidy sum.

24:42.439 --> 24:46.443
Or he sensed we were weak
and chose to align with our enemies.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.613
-Either way, he's made a grave mistake.
-Yeah.

24:51.031 --> 24:54.951
The message is clear.
"Cut us in or suffer the consequences."

24:55.035 --> 24:59.873
With Adams a turncoat and Andre
in the hospital, we are unprotected.

25:00.874 --> 25:04.169
I'll keep watch. I did it for my dad,
I'll do it for you.

25:04.252 --> 25:08.632
That's selfless.
But, alas, a short-term solution.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.134
-We circle the wagons.

25:11.384 --> 25:14.095
Hermione,
you do the campaigning from here.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.389
Veronica, if you're not at school,
you're here.

25:16.473 --> 25:20.101
-I don't want you out. Archie, escort her.
-Absolutely.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.145
Long What's the plan?

25:22.854 --> 25:23.688
Long-term. Long-term.

25:27.525 --> 25:28.526
I have no idea.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.329
It's our account.
You shouldn't have trouble.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.330
Okay.

25:43.041 --> 25:47.337
Hey. Straight to the bank
and right back, blondie.

25:58.431 --> 26:03.979
Roseanne, you behave. You've been fed,
you've been to the water closet.

26:04.271 --> 26:08.316
You should be all set till I come back.
If you have to go, hold it.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.319
Spend the day watching your programs.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.115
<i>Right there. There he comes.</i>

26:15.615 --> 26:19.995
<i>We should've done this with a two-inch</i>
<i>brush. It'd be faster. There we go.</i>

26:20.453 --> 26:21.413
<i>Just drop it in.</i>

26:22.580 --> 26:24.499
<i>Wherever you think it should be.</i>

26:26.084 --> 26:26.918
<i>All right.</i>

26:28.753 --> 26:32.340
<i>You are the creator on this piece</i>
<i>of canvas. You can do anything.</i>

26:41.641 --> 26:43.018
<i>This is a monster tree.</i>

27:03.204 --> 27:06.499
On the 14th of July in 1789,

27:06.583 --> 27:10.837
a state prison on the east side of Paris,
known as the Bastille--

27:10.920 --> 27:14.007
<i>Antoinette Topaz</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

27:14.090 --> 27:17.969
<i>Antoinette Topaz, please report</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

27:29.272 --> 27:31.733
Call for you. She said it was urgent.

27:34.986 --> 27:38.239
-She's not far away.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.325
Who is this?

27:40.950 --> 27:44.120
Cheryl. She's nearby.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.330
Nana Rose?

27:46.164 --> 27:47.749
Nana Rose, where is she?

27:48.208 --> 27:50.710
With the Sisters.

27:55.882 --> 27:56.716
Nana Rose?

28:04.057 --> 28:06.476
What do you think you're doing, Mother?

28:12.941 --> 28:14.818
Mom. I'm just about to head out.

28:14.901 --> 28:18.196
<i>No, Elizabeth.</i>
<i>There's another one in the house now.</i>

28:26.371 --> 28:31.584
I don't know. Just, Elizabeth,
whatever you do, do not come home.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.461
Mom!

28:41.136 --> 28:43.930
<i>Wait, so that was</i>
<i>Nana Rose Blossom who paged you?</i>

28:44.013 --> 28:46.307
Yeah. Although, we got disconnected

28:46.391 --> 28:50.145
before she could say too much
beyond the fact that Cheryl was nearby

28:50.228 --> 28:54.399
-and that she was with the Sisters.
What Sisters?

28:54.482 --> 28:58.862
I don't know. Maybe there's some
reeducation camp called The Sisters.

29:00.655 --> 29:04.868
Well, there's the Sisters of Quiet Mercy,
but that's more like an orphanage.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.912
I don't think they do
gay conversion there.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.372
Who would know for sure?

29:10.039 --> 29:11.583
Oh, my God, of course.

29:11.916 --> 29:14.377
<i>Yes, it could be</i>
<i>the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.</i>

29:14.461 --> 29:18.339
It's one of a few places in the country
that still does conversion therapy.

29:18.757 --> 29:22.427
-Off the books, of course.

29:22.510 --> 29:26.014
During Prohibition, the Sisters ran
a distillery in the basement.

29:26.097 --> 29:29.184
They smuggled booze out
to Sweetwater River via a tunnel

29:29.267 --> 29:30.393
that still exists.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.812
A tunnel we could use
to get to Cheryl?

29:32.896 --> 29:36.274
Potentially. Gay boys in the program
use it to sneak out

29:36.357 --> 29:39.444
to hook up with young men
like myself in Fox Forest.

29:39.527 --> 29:43.698
Wait, Kevin, can you lead us
to this secret gay

29:43.782 --> 29:46.743
I can probably find it,
but we should go at night.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.248
Why did you come back?

29:52.332 --> 29:55.293
Took a week to get
that pepper spray out of my eyes.

29:55.376 --> 29:58.087
Next time, maybe don't attack
my brother.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.883
It's all here. Nice work.

30:01.966 --> 30:05.178
-You have your money. Now go.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.971
-I just got here.
Yeah.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.641
And Riverdale's so much nicer
than Centerville.

30:10.016 --> 30:14.020
And this house,
I could get used to this house.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.439
You said if we gave you the money,
you'd leave.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.275
-Chic.
You think you three can take us?

30:19.984 --> 30:22.987
-Try it.
Sit your ass down, Chic,

30:24.280 --> 30:25.907
or I'll cut out your sister's eyes.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.794
You think you two can take all of us?

30:39.170 --> 30:41.548
-Try it.
-You brought backup.

30:42.382 --> 30:46.261
Does that mean you want me to go
to the sheriff, start making a stink?

30:46.344 --> 30:48.721
That's your call,
but my backup and me,

30:48.805 --> 30:53.434
we're friends with the sheriff's son,
so, whose side do you think he'll pick?

30:53.893 --> 30:56.771
The Coopers are one of the
most respected families in Riverdale.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.607
You two are just
Centreville scumbags.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.193
Anything that was in your car
washed away,

31:02.277 --> 31:06.114
else we'd have heard about it.
Why don't you grab the money and run?

31:38.563 --> 31:40.356
Sorry about your door.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.738
Thank you, Jughead.
Thank your friends for me.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.657
We're Serpents. It's what we do.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.455
You've been telling me something
I didn't wanna hear,

31:56.581 --> 31:57.457
and I'm sorry.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.501
But, Chic...

32:03.087 --> 32:04.923
you've put us in danger twice.

32:05.924 --> 32:06.799
I think that...

32:08.301 --> 32:10.595
you should do what you said,
and leave.

32:12.513 --> 32:13.348
I will.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.558
I'll find a place.

32:17.393 --> 32:21.147
Do it quickly, because you're not
gonna spend another night here.

32:28.404 --> 32:32.116
I appreciate you escorting me home,
but I'm in for the night,

32:32.200 --> 32:35.203
so, you, Archiekins,
are officially off duty.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.247
Archie. Do you have a minute?

32:39.415 --> 32:42.835
-Yeah, of course, Mr. Lodge.
-I'll see you tomorrow.

32:52.428 --> 32:55.598
I've made my decision.
If I don't let Kowalski and Martin

32:55.682 --> 32:59.811
invest in the prison, they'll destroy
everything I'm trying to build here.

32:59.894 --> 33:02.605
They don't share my ambition
to go legitimate.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.274
You mean you'll pay them
a cut for protection?

33:05.358 --> 33:08.277
I won't risk a war,
nor my family's safety.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.488
Not when we're defenseless.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.453
Mr. Lodge...

33:18.746 --> 33:21.374
you haven't told them
you're agreeing, have you?

33:21.457 --> 33:23.334
No, I am meeting them for dinner.

33:25.086 --> 33:28.047
Why

33:33.011 --> 33:34.679
I think we should just start.

33:36.639 --> 33:37.807
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry, Fred.

33:42.186 --> 33:45.773
It's okay. You know, he's busy. I get it.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.609
I'm glad you're here, though.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.081
Good afternoon. My name is Fred Andrews.

34:03.332 --> 34:07.253
And I stand before you today,
a humble resident of this town,

34:07.336 --> 34:10.298
to announce my candidacy for mayor.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.801
We're on opposite sides.
Why should I help you?

34:13.885 --> 34:17.013
At school, we're on opposite sides, yes.

34:17.096 --> 34:19.223
But bigger-picture,
where do you stand,

34:19.307 --> 34:21.851
-I'm against the Southside.

34:21.934 --> 34:25.521
-My dad's for the prison, so am I.
-Me, too. It's the future.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.899
But somebody from the outside
is threatening that.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.943
We need to show them
that is not how things go here.

34:31.861 --> 34:34.614
Stand with me tonight,
and the votes are yours. [Nick Waterhouse's

Clean yourself up.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.619
According to my intel, the tunnel

35:21.702 --> 35:25.123
-from the main residence comes out here.
-That's our way in.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.875
All right, Kevin, you stay here.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.003
If we're not back in 15 minutes,
call your dad. Okay.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.327
When we get to the main building,
what happens then? We search each and every damn room

Come on.

38:08.577 --> 38:09.412
Let's go.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.004
I don't understand. Is he standing us up?

38:19.422 --> 38:21.841
Maybe our first message
wasn't clear enough.

38:21.924 --> 38:23.759
Mr. Kowalski, Mr. Martin.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.178
That was Hiram calling
with his regrets.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.932
And to say you should
go outside to check on your car.

38:43.863 --> 38:44.947
The hell is this?

38:53.414 --> 38:55.541
This is a message
from the Dark Circle.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.460
Hiram Lodge doesn't stand alone,

38:57.543 --> 38:59.128
and Riverdale's protected.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.380
Leave before it's too late.

39:13.601 --> 39:17.021
Before I leave,
I don't suppose you could tell me,

39:17.772 --> 39:21.233
what was so important
that you couldn't be there for your dad?

39:21.317 --> 39:23.235
I had every intention of going.

39:23.319 --> 39:26.864
You used to worship your father.
You used to play music.

39:26.947 --> 39:29.700
You, Jughead, Betty, you were inseparable.

39:29.784 --> 39:33.537
But I'm looking at you now,
and I don't know who you've become.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.084
Who are you, Archie?

39:40.378 --> 39:42.588
<i>I asked Jughead to thank you for me.</i>

39:42.671 --> 39:45.508
But I reconsidered,
because I wanted to do it myself.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.636
So, thank you for what you did.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.680
I also wanted you
to hear it from me

39:51.764 --> 39:55.601
<i>that I am done attacking</i>
<i>and disavowing the Southside.</i>

39:57.103 --> 40:00.356
<i>It's where I'm from,</i>
<i>and I should be proud of that.</i>

40:02.233 --> 40:04.151
<i>And from now on, I will be.</i>

40:04.902 --> 40:10.116
<i>And like my daughter,</i>
<i>I will fight tooth and nail for it.</i>

40:12.326 --> 40:14.495
There he is.
-Came as soon as I could.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.456
-Indeed, but not mine.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.458
The car's yours, Archie.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.628
Mr. And Mrs. Lodge,
I can't accept this.

40:22.711 --> 40:25.172
Sure you can.
Especially since, from now on,

40:25.256 --> 40:27.842
you're gonna be driving our daughter
wherever she needs to go.

40:29.301 --> 40:32.012
Say yes, Archie. Say yes.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.184
-Yeah. Yes.
-Great.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.770
I'll get the engine started.

40:42.815 --> 40:45.484
Now, Archie, last night
was the very definition

40:45.568 --> 40:48.279
-of a short-term solution.
-I'm aware of that.

40:50.865 --> 40:54.535
But our enemies will be back
and not just for 25 percent.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.038
-For everything.
-We'll be ready for them, sir.

41:00.374 --> 41:02.877
Get in, lover boy.
I'll drive us to school.

41:08.966 --> 41:09.800
Be careful.

41:12.178 --> 41:16.932
So, now that you're free,
what's your first move gonna be?

41:17.016 --> 41:21.270
Well, Toni, if revenge is a dish
best served cold,

41:21.353 --> 41:24.857
my mother and uncle better
brace themselves for a polar vortex.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.444
But there's something
more pressing than that.

41:33.949 --> 41:36.994
Kevin, I hear I'm back in time
for <i>Carrie: The Musical,</i>

41:37.077 --> 41:39.121
-which you're directing.
-You are.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.248
I'm having auditions this afternoon.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.085
Well, as far as the lead role's concerned,
cancel them.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.173
I'm obviously Riverdale High's
Carrie White.

41:49.423 --> 41:50.382
Oh.
