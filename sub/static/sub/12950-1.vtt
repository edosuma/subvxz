01:46.967 --> 01:48.958
Sydney, time's up.

01:49.047 --> 01:51.117
OK.

01:51.207 --> 01:55.644
Then I'll... just... finish

01:55.727 --> 01:58.116
my... little... essay.

02:00.327 --> 02:02.283
Thank you.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.481
<i>- I'm sure I got a D.</i>
<i>- You didn't get a D.</i>

02:17.567 --> 02:21.003
I got a D, I think I got a 64.

02:21.087 --> 02:24.397
- You've never gotten a D.
- I've gotten a D.

02:24.487 --> 02:26.796
High school, Home Ec.
Remember the...

02:26.887 --> 02:29.606
Yeah, what did you do?
Embroider a T-shirt?

02:29.687 --> 02:34.124
- Sweatshirt, that was my assignment.
- It was obscene, about the teacher?

02:34.207 --> 02:36.801
That sexist pig.
I deserved a scholarship.

02:36.887 --> 02:39.355
- Wait. Hold on.
- This time, I deserve a D.

02:39.447 --> 02:42.678
I didn't prepare,
I didn't... have enough time.

02:42.767 --> 02:46.123
We've had this conversation.
Quit the bank.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.879
What are you doing?

02:47.967 --> 02:51.676
I can't go through double shift
again holding on to this.

02:52.327 --> 02:56.559
- Did you get Dave Matthews tickets?
- Will you stand up, please?

02:58.687 --> 03:02.600
I wanted to wait, maybe do it
at the weekend, but...

03:02.687 --> 03:04.996
- I couldn't.
- What's going on?

03:05.087 --> 03:09.319
Remember our first date?
The bowling alley?

03:09.407 --> 03:12.877
- The loud guy?
- Oh, God.

03:12.967 --> 03:14.878
<i>Build me up</i>

03:14.967 --> 03:18.164
<i>Buttercup, baby,</i>
<i>then you bring me down</i>

03:18.247 --> 03:20.317
<i>And mess me around</i>

03:20.407 --> 03:22.318
<i>And then worst of all</i>

03:22.407 --> 03:25.080
<i>You never call, baby</i>
<i>when you say you will</i>

03:25.527 --> 03:28.758
<i>But I love you still, I need you</i>

03:28.847 --> 03:30.883
<i>More than anyone, darling</i>

03:30.967 --> 03:33.925
<i>I know that I'm yours</i>
<i>from the start</i>

03:34.007 --> 03:36.840
<i>Build me up, buttercup</i>

03:36.927 --> 03:40.078
<i>Don't break my heart</i>

03:40.167 --> 03:42.158
Shut up!

03:43.967 --> 03:47.880
Sydney, I can't tell you how much
I hope you'll marry me.

03:49.447 --> 03:52.007
Despite what I just did.

03:59.567 --> 04:01.558
Yes.

04:08.527 --> 04:10.483
Yes.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.523
I love you.

04:15.487 --> 04:18.843
- Oh, Fran.
- I know. I cry at every damn thing.

04:18.927 --> 04:22.124
Let me see it again.
Oh, honey, it's beautiful.

04:22.207 --> 04:27.440
- I know. I'm getting married.
- You're getting married.

04:28.887 --> 04:32.800
- So, d'you tell Will yet?
- I'm meeting him if you wanna come.

04:32.887 --> 04:37.597
No. I've got 300 orthopaedic surgeons
to feed, and no desire to exercise.

04:37.687 --> 04:40.599
- What about your dad?
- I haven't told him yet.

04:40.687 --> 04:42.837
I don't want him to ruin this.

04:42.927 --> 04:46.044
- Not this, you know?
- Yeah, I think you're right.

04:46.127 --> 04:49.199
If you call him,
he's gonna let you down.

04:49.287 --> 04:52.006
Yeah, I know.

04:52.087 --> 04:55.636
Your mom would be so happy for you.

04:57.007 --> 04:59.680
- You know that?
- She would.

05:01.047 --> 05:02.958
Maybe I should call my dad.

05:03.047 --> 05:06.198
Unless you're talking about
importing airplane parts,

05:06.287 --> 05:09.359
that man has nothing to say.
Let him get the invitation.

05:09.447 --> 05:12.962
It's exporting airplane parts.
He already knows.

05:13.047 --> 05:16.278
Danny called him to ask permission.

05:16.367 --> 05:18.483
Danny called your dad? Your dad?

05:18.567 --> 05:21.206
And how did that go?

05:21.287 --> 05:23.323
<i>Yeah?</i>

05:23.407 --> 05:25.602
- Oh, Mr Bristow?
<i>- Yes.</i>

05:25.687 --> 05:27.678
Hi, it's Danny Hecht.

05:29.367 --> 05:31.517
<i>Sydney's boyfriend.</i>

05:31.607 --> 05:34.201
- Is Sydney all right?
- Oh, yeah, she's fine.

05:34.287 --> 05:36.562
Nothing to worry about.

05:36.647 --> 05:40.162
I'm calling because I'm planning on
asking Sydney to marry me,

05:40.247 --> 05:43.478
and I was hoping
to get your approval.

05:44.487 --> 05:47.399
- Danny, let me ask you a question.
- Sure.

05:47.487 --> 05:49.762
How well do you know my daughter?

05:49.847 --> 05:52.281
We've been dating for two years.

05:52.367 --> 05:56.883
If you need to ask me about this, I
have a sense you don't know Sydney.

05:57.207 --> 06:00.961
I love your daughter, I want
to marry her. That's why I'm calling.

06:01.047 --> 06:04.801
First of all, the truth is,
this is just a courtesy call.

06:04.887 --> 06:09.642
Like saying to a neighbour, "We're
having a party, if that's all right."

06:09.727 --> 06:13.197
What you really mean is,
"We are having a loud party."

06:13.287 --> 06:15.118
Mr Bristow...

06:15.207 --> 06:17.880
Sydney doesn't give a damn
what my opinion is.

06:17.967 --> 06:20.435
What interests me is that you do.

06:20.527 --> 06:24.236
It's just a custom to call
the father, that's all this is.

06:24.327 --> 06:28.639
I'll tell you what. I may become
your father-in-law, that's fine,

06:28.727 --> 06:33.596
but I will not be used as a charming
anecdote you tell your friends,

06:33.687 --> 06:38.078
so they can see what a quaint
old-fashioned guy Danny really is.

06:39.327 --> 06:41.522
Are we clear?

06:41.607 --> 06:43.325
Yes, sir.

06:43.407 --> 06:45.318
Good.

06:45.407 --> 06:47.716
Then welcome to the family.

07:21.047 --> 07:22.719
You're in late.

07:22.807 --> 07:24.798
Sorry. Executive elevator.

07:24.887 --> 07:28.277
Come on, man, drop me off at 12.
All right. Damn...

07:30.127 --> 07:34.279
- Zachary feeling better?
- Much, yeah. Thanks.

07:38.887 --> 07:40.684
See ya.

08:13.487 --> 08:15.284
God, I hate this.

08:15.367 --> 08:18.882
If only Ramadan Abadallah Shallah
still taught in Tampa.

08:18.967 --> 08:21.686
Not my case work.
These new headsets pinch.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.883
Give it to me. Any word from Declan?

08:23.967 --> 08:26.720
Not since Tehran.
I'm telling myself he's fine.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.401
He's done this before.
Disappeared for days.

08:29.487 --> 08:31.364
- What's with you?
- Nothing. Why?

08:31.447 --> 08:34.245
- You've got, like, a glow.
- I don't have a glow.

08:34.327 --> 08:36.397
Yeah, look at that!

08:36.486 --> 08:39.479
- Here. Come on. There's no glow.
- Is she glowing?

08:39.567 --> 08:41.239
- Big time.
- You hear that?

08:41.927 --> 08:44.680
Yes. Better. Good.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.962
Oskar M端ller was killed last month.

08:47.047 --> 08:50.835
He was riding a moped
and was hit by an ambulance.

08:50.927 --> 08:53.521
We had kept an eye on this guy
for some time.

08:53.607 --> 08:56.280
He fancied himself
a modern day alchemist.

08:56.367 --> 08:58.801
His IQ was one of the highest
on the planet.

08:58.887 --> 09:00.798
But he was riding a moped.

09:00.887 --> 09:04.766
There was a frenzy to recover
M端ller's notebooks and experiment,

09:04.847 --> 09:07.919
but none were found,
at least not by the West.

09:08.007 --> 09:12.523
Cultural affairs building, Taipei,
Hsincheng North Road, section two.

09:12.607 --> 09:15.644
This building is also
an FTL cover station.

09:15.727 --> 09:19.083
We received word that one of
M端ller's plans surfaced here.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.476
- Who's the mole?
- Antonio Quintero.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.319
This is his last transmission.

09:23.407 --> 09:26.604
Uplink was on the 15th,
brush pass scheduled for Tuesday.

09:26.687 --> 09:28.245
Quintero did not show.

09:28.327 --> 09:32.240
- What is that, hieratic?
- Good try. Actually, it's demotic.

09:32.327 --> 09:36.605
Notes in ancient languages was one
of M端ller's quirks. He had a few.

09:36.687 --> 09:39.201
- Quintero's been burned?
- We don't know.

09:39.287 --> 09:43.405
The Ambassador's throwing
a reception next Tuesday.

09:43.487 --> 09:47.526
You fly to Taiwan on Monday.
You're employed by Modira Plastics.

09:47.607 --> 09:50.121
Looking for
a new manufacturing plant.

09:50.207 --> 09:53.165
Based on the notes,
you'll case the east wing,

09:53.247 --> 09:55.044
measurements, lock specs, IO.

09:55.127 --> 09:59.086
Locate the lab where the plans
are being held and come home.

09:59.167 --> 10:03.399
That's all. No retrieval.
We can't risk it. OK, Marshall, go.

10:03.487 --> 10:05.239
Yeah. Thank you.

10:05.327 --> 10:08.160
OK. How is everyone? Good?

10:08.247 --> 10:12.604
Alright. The first... thing...
I have here is a...

10:12.687 --> 10:17.522
Well, looks like a lighter.
Something to light a cigarette,

10:17.607 --> 10:22.123
but actually it's an RF scrambler.
It disrupts any video for 420 yards.

10:22.207 --> 10:28.077
If I were to hit this switch,
the whole block would be in panic.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.681
What the hell, right? Yep.

10:30.767 --> 10:34.362
You see?
Everyone's totally freaking out.

10:34.447 --> 10:37.883
"What's going on? My computer,
my DVD's not working."

10:37.967 --> 10:40.925
And we're back. OK.
I got a 20 volt cell in here,

10:41.007 --> 10:43.316
so you only get
four minutes of charge.

10:43.407 --> 10:48.197
So, you wanna get in,
do a thing, then get out.

10:48.287 --> 10:52.075
Four minutes two seconds
and your f... screwed. OK.

10:52.767 --> 10:56.999
The other thing I got here...
This is good. You're gonna like this.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.396
It's something I'm excited about.

10:59.487 --> 11:04.003
Looks like lipstick, you know,
something you'd do for your lips.

11:04.087 --> 11:07.124
You see? In the woman's...
Refresh or something.

11:07.207 --> 11:11.883
But... This is the amazing thing.
It actually takes pictures,

11:11.967 --> 11:16.677
and it measures space
in three axes from one vantage point.

11:16.767 --> 11:19.235
It assembles images based on GPS,

11:19.327 --> 11:23.400
and creates an accurate blueprint
of any building, but that's not...

11:23.487 --> 11:27.400
It's got a camera, a short-pulse
laser, plus a grid analyser.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.478
I got it to 42 snaps right now,

11:29.567 --> 11:33.480
but I wanna get it to 47,
cos that's a prime number.

11:34.087 --> 11:36.282
You might think this is simple,

11:36.367 --> 11:41.236
but until we know about Quintero,
we assume the enemy's waiting.

11:41.327 --> 11:43.887
So I want you to do us a favour.

11:44.887 --> 11:46.081
Come back.

12:00.367 --> 12:02.358
- Good run.
- Thanks.

12:04.087 --> 12:08.080
So, where were you last night?
I called you.

12:08.167 --> 12:10.886
Oh, yeah.
I don't wanna talk about it.

12:11.887 --> 12:14.003
My sister set me up on a blind date.

12:14.087 --> 12:16.601
Was it good?

12:16.687 --> 12:19.201
- For the date it was.
- You didn't like her?

12:19.287 --> 12:21.801
Not so much.
I don't like my sister any more.

12:21.887 --> 12:24.879
That's the problem
when siblings live with you.

12:24.967 --> 12:28.676
They make you meet people
you aren't supposed to meet in life.

12:28.767 --> 12:32.316
- Why was the date so bad?
- Her favourite movie of all time?

12:32.407 --> 12:35.205
Are you ready for this? <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

12:35.287 --> 12:38.404
So? I'm sure
it's a lot of people's favourite.

12:38.487 --> 12:42.799
That's probably true, but
of all time? That includes like...

12:42.887 --> 12:45.606
Well, every other movie ever made.
All of 'em.

12:45.687 --> 12:48.281
You see <i>Lawrence of Arabia's</i>
at the Egyptian?

12:48.367 --> 12:50.278
- Yeah, I did.
- You wanna go?

12:50.367 --> 12:53.006
- I'd love to, but...
- Danny's working late.

12:53.087 --> 12:55.885
- I'm taking him dinner.
- We can go to a late one.

12:55.967 --> 12:59.880
- It's only playing on Thursday.
- We're getting married.

13:05.887 --> 13:08.082
Look at that, you're wearing a...

13:08.167 --> 13:11.477
You're wearing a ring.
I didn't even see it. That's...

13:12.087 --> 13:14.521
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

13:17.767 --> 13:20.520
- You wanna get a couple more laps?
- I'm done.

13:20.607 --> 13:22.677
OK, I'm gonna get a couple more.

14:06.687 --> 14:11.681
I called Todd. They haven't rented
that place yet if you wanna go look.

14:18.527 --> 14:20.563
Impossible, isn't it?

14:20.647 --> 14:23.684
One day,
there's gonna be a baby in there.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.435
My patients would love that.

14:27.527 --> 14:32.078
Knowing that their doctor still can't
believe women can get pregnant.

15:00.727 --> 15:02.843
Get undressed.

15:15.887 --> 15:18.321
I work for the CIA.

15:22.847 --> 15:24.280
Sydney...

15:28.847 --> 15:31.964
I'm an operations officer
for the CIA.

17:18.247 --> 17:21.478
<i>It was during the fall</i>
<i>of my freshman year.</i>

17:21.567 --> 17:26.766
<i>A man approached me. He told me</i>
<i>the US Government might talk to me</i>

17:26.847 --> 17:29.361
<i>about a job.</i>

17:31.767 --> 17:36.477
<i>When I asked why me, all he told me</i>
<i>was that I fit a profile.</i>

17:41.767 --> 17:45.601
<i>I didn't feel I belonged anywhere,</i>
<i>even at college,</i>

17:45.687 --> 17:47.962
<i>and I needed the money anyway.</i>

17:48.047 --> 17:51.483
<i>So, I met with him,</i>
<i>and they offered me a job.</i>

17:53.447 --> 17:55.244
A job with the CIA?

17:57.047 --> 17:59.356
Not exactly. It's...

18:01.167 --> 18:03.886
It's a covert branch.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.844
This is crazy.

18:05.927 --> 18:10.079
OK, OK. So, covert branch.
Then what?

18:10.167 --> 18:14.445
After the first month, I asked if
I could test for agent training.

18:17.807 --> 18:20.002
<i>The test was easy.</i>

18:20.087 --> 18:26.686
<i>They said I was a natural. Maybe</i>
<i>I was because I advanced quickly.</i>

18:26.767 --> 18:29.565
It was exciting.

18:29.647 --> 18:31.842
This isn't real.

18:31.927 --> 18:33.918
Danny.

18:36.087 --> 18:40.603
Since my mother died, I've always
hoped that I'd find someone

18:40.687 --> 18:42.723
to give my life meaning.

18:42.807 --> 18:46.880
That person is you.
I just met the agency first.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.555
I can't quit.

18:52.287 --> 18:54.642
Syd, I love you.

18:55.727 --> 18:57.638
But this...

18:57.727 --> 19:01.925
I've... I've just gotta figure out
what I'm thinking.

19:05.127 --> 19:07.960
You can't tell anyone about this.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.083
About what I do.

19:10.167 --> 19:12.203
No-one.

19:12.287 --> 19:14.437
- I...
- Danny, I'm not kidding.

19:14.527 --> 19:16.677
I got it.

19:16.767 --> 19:21.124
I need a... I need to walk.
I'll call you tonight.

19:22.687 --> 19:24.917
I've got my trip.

19:27.487 --> 19:29.284
San Diego?

19:29.367 --> 19:31.278
I'll call you when I get back.

19:32.887 --> 19:34.878
Be careful.

19:55.807 --> 19:58.275
You know, Sloane doesn't like it.

19:59.087 --> 20:02.284
- That you're still in grad school.
- I know.

20:02.887 --> 20:07.483
He'd rather none of us have
a life outside. I'm not giving it up.

20:08.967 --> 20:10.958
You all right?

20:15.687 --> 20:18.042
How long have you and Diane
been married?

20:18.127 --> 20:21.517
11... No, 12 years. Damn.

20:23.607 --> 20:25.962
You love her?

20:26.047 --> 20:28.356
Of course I do.

20:28.447 --> 20:31.723
- And you never said a thing?
- About what?

20:31.807 --> 20:34.719
About what we do.

20:34.807 --> 20:39.323
Diane is married to an investment
analyst who loves his job.

20:43.327 --> 20:46.876
- I'm protecting her from the truth.
- And you don't...

20:48.007 --> 20:51.204
You don't feel like
you're lying to her?

20:51.287 --> 20:53.596
If there's one rule you don't break,

20:53.687 --> 20:56.076
that's the rule you don't break.

20:58.487 --> 21:01.365
It must just get easier, after.

22:09.767 --> 22:13.680
<i>- Hey, this is Sydney.</i>
<i>- This is Danny. I don't live here.</i>

22:13.767 --> 22:15.997
<i>Leave a message. I'll call you back.</i>

22:16.087 --> 22:19.045
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>She meant to say thank you.</i>

22:19.127 --> 22:24.963
You're not there. Well, I know
you're not there or in San Diego.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.720
You could be anywhere,
doing anything.

22:39.727 --> 22:43.481
<i>Which is...</i>
<i>Which is the crux of the issue.</i>

22:58.967 --> 23:00.685
Can I live like this?

23:01.687 --> 23:05.475
<i>Not knowing where,</i>
<i>or why, or when?</i>

23:12.807 --> 23:16.117
<i>Can I live in the dark?</i>

23:16.207 --> 23:18.118
<i>And the answer...</i>

23:18.207 --> 23:21.324
<i>The only answer</i>
<i>I came up with, Syd, was...</i>

23:24.767 --> 23:26.678
...was yes.

23:26.767 --> 23:29.565
Syd, I don't care.

23:29.647 --> 23:32.684
<i>The whole world's</i>
<i>a nightmare, anyway.</i>

23:32.767 --> 23:36.555
<i>It's all dangerous,</i>
<i>no matter what we do.</i>

23:38.367 --> 23:42.997
<i>I couldn't live with myself, saying</i>
<i>goodbye to you because of risk.</i>

23:43.087 --> 23:46.124
It's all a risk.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.004
I...

23:48.087 --> 23:50.521
No, the kids thing.

23:50.607 --> 23:54.122
That we have to talk about
because I want kids.

23:54.207 --> 23:56.482
<i>I love kids.</i>

23:56.567 --> 24:00.446
<i>But, you see,</i>
<i>maybe there is a way out, cos...</i>

24:00.527 --> 24:02.836
<i>People aren't spies forever.</i>

24:02.927 --> 24:07.318
<i>At some time,</i>
<i>people have to be able to say</i>

24:07.407 --> 24:09.875
<i>they used to be spies.</i>

24:11.247 --> 24:12.646
<i>I miss you, Syd.</i>

24:13.367 --> 24:15.562
Come... Come home.

24:33.927 --> 24:35.918
Yeah?

24:38.567 --> 24:40.558
Who?

24:42.887 --> 24:44.878
What else?

24:47.607 --> 24:50.804
Yeah, well, get me
the audio right away. Yeah.

26:06.367 --> 26:09.086
I'm so lost. Oh, my God.

26:09.167 --> 26:11.237
I was looking for the bathroom.

26:11.327 --> 26:13.682
There should be signs. In English.

26:13.767 --> 26:16.156
I don't know
if you're in charge, but...

26:17.687 --> 26:20.076
This area is restricted.

26:20.767 --> 26:23.759
Please, I was just
going to the bathroom.

26:23.847 --> 26:27.203
You don't know my boss.
If he found out I'd been drinking,

26:27.287 --> 26:30.882
that I'd gotten in trouble,
I swear, I will lose my job.

26:31.487 --> 26:33.762
I swear it.

26:40.287 --> 26:42.278
The rest room is this way.

26:42.367 --> 26:45.165
Thank you. Bless your heart.

26:45.247 --> 26:47.363
I like your tie.

26:54.087 --> 26:55.679
<i>We have a breach.</i>

26:56.687 --> 26:59.076
It appears Daniel Hecht
has become aware

26:59.167 --> 27:01.681
of Sydney's affiliation
with the agency.

27:08.687 --> 27:11.076
You understand what that means?

27:18.887 --> 27:20.684
Yes, I understand.

27:23.167 --> 27:26.159
I appreciate you
telling me yourself.

27:28.527 --> 27:31.519
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- Don't be.

27:31.607 --> 27:34.075
You know me well enough.

27:34.967 --> 27:37.481
You know where my loyalty lies.

27:49.607 --> 27:52.679
- Mr Gonzales.
- Mr Dixon. Where's Bristow?

27:53.327 --> 27:57.036
- Looking for this?
- Looking for her. Where is she?

27:57.127 --> 27:59.880
- She left me at the gate.
- Left you at the gate?

27:59.967 --> 28:04.165
Said she was grabbing a taxi.
What's the problem?

28:04.247 --> 28:08.081
Hey, I'm back. I didn't even
go home first. I took a cab...

29:20.487 --> 29:21.966
What did you do?

29:25.607 --> 29:28.201
I might ask you the same question.

29:29.407 --> 29:33.798
Security became aware of the breach
and performed their function.

29:33.887 --> 29:37.482
You're familiar with the codes
of conduct, Agent Bristow.

29:38.247 --> 29:41.319
You knew the codes applied to you,
even as you put at risk

29:41.407 --> 29:45.844
the lives of every man and woman
working at this agency.

29:45.927 --> 29:50.603
Danny wasn't a risk.
He was... He was just a man.

29:50.687 --> 29:54.077
He was a doctor. He was just...

29:54.167 --> 29:58.604
Listen to me. Information about
this agency is treated like a virus.

29:58.687 --> 30:02.282
There is only one response.
That is containment.

30:02.367 --> 30:05.006
You put us into
a compromised situation,

30:05.087 --> 30:08.477
and though I despise
that countermeasure we had to...

30:12.487 --> 30:14.876
Stop saying "we".

30:15.687 --> 30:18.997
Stop talking about the agency.

30:19.087 --> 30:20.998
You killed the man I love.

30:22.727 --> 30:25.002
No, Agent Bristow.

30:25.087 --> 30:26.566
You did.

30:35.807 --> 30:37.206
Let me out.

30:37.287 --> 30:41.075
I can't imagine
how difficult this is for you.

30:41.167 --> 30:43.476
Let me out.

30:43.567 --> 30:48.118
However, before you go anywhere,
McCullough needs to see you.

30:48.207 --> 30:51.563
You see, you're a risk now, too.

30:55.287 --> 30:58.199
Are you an operative of SD6?

30:58.287 --> 31:00.278
Yes.

31:00.367 --> 31:04.280
How long have you been
an operative of SD6?

31:05.687 --> 31:07.484
Seven years.

31:09.247 --> 31:14.685
What is your identification and
classification number with SD6?

31:16.607 --> 31:19.519
My identification
and classification is...

31:19.607 --> 31:23.600
Have you ever been so entertained
by the cleverness of a crook

31:23.687 --> 31:26.076
that you hoped he'd get away with it?

31:26.167 --> 31:30.604
Did you reveal information
regarding SD6 to Daniel Hecht?

31:30.687 --> 31:34.123
Do you ever lie? What is
your relation to Daniel Hecht?

31:34.207 --> 31:36.118
Covert branch of the CIA.

31:36.207 --> 31:39.995
If a person is arrested for stealing
and others have helped,

31:40.087 --> 31:42.078
should he reveal his helpers?

31:42.167 --> 31:43.919
Yes.

32:36.927 --> 32:38.838
Wow!

32:42.287 --> 32:45.484
I don't know
what you put in that stuff. Wow!

32:48.887 --> 32:51.606
I'd rather not
make this too painful.

32:53.087 --> 32:56.477
Me, too. Thanks.
Glad we're on the same page.

32:56.567 --> 32:58.683
That's good.

33:03.727 --> 33:06.480
Who are you working for?

33:09.207 --> 33:11.675
I will not ask you again.

33:14.087 --> 33:16.078
OK.

33:16.687 --> 33:18.484
Get a pen.

33:24.047 --> 33:26.686
Write this down.

33:26.767 --> 33:29.998
E... M.

33:30.087 --> 33:33.966
E-T-l-B.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.400
- You got that?
- Yes.

33:36.487 --> 33:39.160
OK. Now reverse it.

33:42.047 --> 33:44.436
BITE ME

33:54.367 --> 33:58.201
I've got bad news for you, man.
I am your worst enemy.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.437
I've got nothing to lose.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.596
That's not exactly true.

34:17.607 --> 34:19.916
You have teeth.

34:30.567 --> 34:33.639
These questions
resonate even louder,

34:33.726 --> 34:38.755
when you lose somebody
through a senseless act of violence.

34:39.766 --> 34:43.396
But we hear them,
echoing in our minds.

34:44.687 --> 34:46.279
Why?

36:31.087 --> 36:34.397
<i>- Hey, this is Sydney.</i>
<i>- And Danny. I don't live here.</i>

36:34.487 --> 36:36.876
<i>Leave me a message</i>
<i>and I'll call you back.</i>

36:36.967 --> 36:39.800
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>She meant to say thank you.</i>

36:53.887 --> 36:55.684
Hey, this is Sydney.

36:55.767 --> 36:57.678
Leave me a message.

36:58.287 --> 37:00.084
Thank you.

37:12.727 --> 37:14.957
She loved a man,

37:15.047 --> 37:17.277
and she lost him.

37:17.367 --> 37:19.756
This isn't a new theme in literature,

37:19.847 --> 37:22.566
but it seems to be
one of the favourites.

37:22.647 --> 37:24.558
For instance,

37:24.647 --> 37:28.481
what does Tennyson
contribute to this subject?

37:28.567 --> 37:32.480
His work is mildly out of fashion

37:32.567 --> 37:36.799
but I would like you to consider
his exploration of this theme.

37:36.887 --> 37:40.118
It seems that...
It seems to be...

37:50.087 --> 37:51.884
Syd.

37:54.887 --> 37:57.276
- Need a lift?
- No, thanks.

37:57.367 --> 37:59.483
I'm just going to the library.

38:01.367 --> 38:03.597
How've you been?

38:03.687 --> 38:05.598
OK. You?

38:05.687 --> 38:07.917
Good. Better.

38:08.927 --> 38:11.680
Thanks for the flowers. It was nice.

38:12.887 --> 38:15.401
Look. Sloane's getting impatient.

38:16.087 --> 38:18.601
They gave you a month off.
It's been three.

38:18.687 --> 38:22.999
- I've talked to Sloane.
- Apparently not to his satisfaction.

38:23.087 --> 38:26.284
I know they sent you here
to bring me back. I'm sorry.

38:27.047 --> 38:29.277
I just can't yet.

38:29.367 --> 38:33.724
They got word. FTL has built
the M端ller device. Sloane wants it.

38:33.807 --> 38:35.638
- They don't need me.
- They do.

38:35.727 --> 38:38.878
- Tell them to call Quintero.
- Quintero's dead.

38:39.807 --> 38:42.480
We got confirmation Thursday. Syd?

38:44.287 --> 38:47.757
They need you active,
and if they don't have confidence

38:47.847 --> 38:50.202
in someone
who's in as deep as you are,

38:50.287 --> 38:52.357
they'll fix that problem.

38:57.407 --> 38:59.443
I really am sorry.

39:01.887 --> 39:04.685
- I'll see you.
- Syd?

41:08.287 --> 41:10.562
Hello?

41:10.647 --> 41:13.605
- Francie, hi.
- Wanna hear the worst day ever?

41:13.687 --> 41:15.405
Could you call my cell phone?

41:15.487 --> 41:19.196
- I can barely hear you.
- Just call me right back.

41:19.287 --> 41:21.596
OK.

42:24.647 --> 42:27.081
Get in.

42:27.687 --> 42:29.564
Daddy?

42:31.887 --> 42:33.923
Now!

42:44.687 --> 42:46.279
Dad, you have a gun!

42:47.887 --> 42:50.276
- Hello?
- I'll call you later.

42:50.367 --> 42:53.086
I rang twice.
You won't believe the day I had.

42:53.167 --> 42:54.759
Me, too.

42:54.847 --> 42:57.122
- Hang on.
- Dad, what are you doing?

43:26.167 --> 43:29.125
There might be others.
Put your seat belt on.

43:29.207 --> 43:32.324
There are many things
you won't understand tonight.

43:32.407 --> 43:35.479
You must understand
that the agency doesn't trust you,

43:35.567 --> 43:38.445
and they're gonna kill you
unless you do as I say.

43:38.527 --> 43:40.677
I work for SD-6, just like you.

43:40.767 --> 43:42.837
Undercover at Jennings Aerospace.

43:44.687 --> 43:48.396
You leave tonight. Fly to France,
a connection to Switzerland.

43:48.487 --> 43:51.399
You'll be stopped at customs
so I got you new papers.

43:51.487 --> 43:55.765
- I thought you sold aeroplane parts.
- I don't. I never did.

44:04.527 --> 44:08.076
That car's taking you to the airport.
I have to get back.

44:08.167 --> 44:09.964
- Who are you?
- Get in that car.

44:10.047 --> 44:13.084
In two minutes they leave,
with or without you.

44:15.247 --> 44:19.320
There's no time not to trust me. You
don't know who you're dealing with.

44:19.567 --> 44:23.640
What does that mean?
Who the hell am I dealing with?

44:26.887 --> 44:29.879
About a decade ago,
a pool of agents went freelance.

44:29.967 --> 44:31.685
Russian, Libyan, Chinese...

44:31.767 --> 44:34.486
- The Alliance Of 12.
- What do you know of them?

44:34.567 --> 44:37.479
They're an enemy of the US.
Mercenaries.

44:37.567 --> 44:42.880
I'm one of them. SD-6 is not
a black ops division of the CIA.

44:42.967 --> 44:45.481
SD-6 is a branch of The Alliance.

44:46.887 --> 44:49.685
You work for the enemy
you thought you opposed.

44:49.767 --> 44:52.839
- That's impossible.
- Why have you not been to Langley?

44:52.927 --> 44:57.682
You've been lied to. All lower-level
agents have been lied to.

45:00.287 --> 45:02.801
I am trying to help you here.

45:02.887 --> 45:05.879
So you're saying
I'm working for the enemy.

45:07.087 --> 45:10.477
- And you are the enemy.
- Sydney, this is your last chance.

45:10.567 --> 45:12.558
You have to go.

45:18.007 --> 45:21.204
Who are you to come to me
and act like a father?

45:21.287 --> 45:25.485
If you wanna help me,
stay away from me.

45:43.487 --> 45:45.205
OK.

45:46.207 --> 45:48.198
Let's try one more time.

45:49.087 --> 45:51.442
Who do you work for?

45:53.487 --> 45:54.761
I...

46:01.487 --> 46:03.478
I just wanna say...

46:05.687 --> 46:09.077
Start with the teeth in the back,
if you don't mind.

46:15.527 --> 46:17.518
No!

46:29.287 --> 46:32.279
Yeah. Wait.
Let me ask the quest... No.

46:32.367 --> 46:35.086
The newspaper's doing you a favour.
Yeah...

46:35.767 --> 46:37.803
I'm on a counter run. Want anything?

46:37.887 --> 46:40.196
- No. Is Liv in?
- What do you think?

46:40.287 --> 46:42.482
- She still work here?
- Hope not.

46:46.087 --> 46:50.285
Meet me on the roof? Perfect.
Some guy just totally hung up on me.

46:51.087 --> 46:53.078
So I got an hour. Wanna get lunch?

46:53.167 --> 46:56.284
- What happened to your face?
- I need your help.

46:57.367 --> 46:59.801
- Are you OK?
- I can't explain so don't ask.

46:59.887 --> 47:01.878
You just gotta trust me.

47:03.287 --> 47:04.481
Of course.

47:04.567 --> 47:07.684
I need one of your sister's
credit cards. A $3,000 limit.

47:07.767 --> 47:09.598
I'll pay her back. Can you get it?

47:09.687 --> 47:12.485
Syd, what is this? Do you
owe somebody some money?

47:12.567 --> 47:14.285
There's something else.

47:14.887 --> 47:17.685
Do you know where
Amy keeps her passport?

47:52.967 --> 47:55.686
How many bags
are you checking in to Taipei?

47:55.767 --> 47:58.281
Just this.
What's your lipstick? I love it.

47:58.367 --> 48:01.723
- Allex Jane Lux, Concorde Grape.
- Totally pops.

48:01.807 --> 48:04.480
Thanks. May I see your passport?

48:04.567 --> 48:07.684
Ever tried this? I think
it's too light for me. Do you?

48:09.087 --> 48:10.679
- It's pretty.
- Thanks.

48:10.767 --> 48:11.916
Window or aisle?

51:38.487 --> 51:41.285
The pill I gave you helps the pain.

51:41.367 --> 51:45.918
I could tell, because
you stopped screaming so loudly.

51:46.887 --> 51:49.082
That medication, however,

51:49.167 --> 51:51.476
only lasts for two hours.

51:52.287 --> 51:54.005
And it's been...

51:54.087 --> 51:55.884
two hours, almost.

51:57.887 --> 51:59.684
So...

52:00.287 --> 52:02.562
...you have a choice.

52:05.287 --> 52:07.118
Which way...

52:07.207 --> 52:08.879
we go next.

52:17.847 --> 52:19.997
Tell me

52:20.087 --> 52:22.282
and you get one more.

52:22.887 --> 52:25.037
The agency.

52:25.127 --> 52:28.483
- Louder.
- I can't.

52:30.887 --> 52:33.276
Who do you work for?

52:34.087 --> 52:37.284
You... pretty little girl.

53:12.807 --> 53:14.798
No... No...

55:18.887 --> 55:20.366
Hey, guys.

55:54.847 --> 55:56.678
Yeah?

55:58.287 --> 56:00.881
Send her in. Now.

56:01.287 --> 56:03.482
Yeah, make sure Ravel knows.

56:34.687 --> 56:35.961
I'm back.

56:37.087 --> 56:40.079
- All right.
- I'm taking the week off.

56:41.487 --> 56:43.523
I've got mid-terms.

57:00.087 --> 57:02.396
May I help you?

57:03.407 --> 57:06.046
I need to speak
to your director, Mr Devlin.

57:06.687 --> 57:10.475
I'm sorry. Mr Devlin's not
available. May I leave a message?

57:11.407 --> 57:13.875
Tell him he has a walk-in.

57:17.887 --> 57:20.685
Roxanne, we have
a walk-in for Mr Devlin.

57:21.927 --> 57:23.679
Yes.

57:29.487 --> 57:31.284
Come with me, please.

57:36.927 --> 57:39.919
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENC Y

57:43.287 --> 57:45.482
- Did you do the report?
- I know.

57:45.567 --> 57:47.683
I'll get to it, I swear. Thanks.

57:52.087 --> 57:54.885
There's some more coffee
and something to eat.

58:00.167 --> 58:03.364
Just let Mr Weiss know
if you need anything else.

58:03.447 --> 58:05.915
A new pen. This one's dying.

58:07.887 --> 58:10.082
Thanks.

58:41.207 --> 58:44.005
- This could be interesting.
- So am I in?

58:44.767 --> 58:47.281
Not yet.
They're reviewing your statement.

58:47.367 --> 58:49.881
- It's... You wrote a lot.
- I know.

58:49.967 --> 58:52.276
I mean, it's like Tolstoy-long.

58:52.967 --> 58:55.686
Devlin says
it could take weeks to verify.

58:55.767 --> 58:59.077
But I know we could use
another double agent in SD-6.

58:59.687 --> 59:02.997
We'll be in touch. I'll get you
out of here, keep you concealed.

59:03.087 --> 59:05.555
- Why shake your head?
- You said "another".

59:05.647 --> 59:07.877
So?

59:07.967 --> 59:12.006
So if you had one, you wouldn't
tell me until I was authenticated.

59:12.087 --> 59:16.239
- Unless I had an instinct about you.
- You don't have another double.

59:16.327 --> 59:19.558
- We might.
- But you want me to believe you do.

59:19.647 --> 59:23.799
So if I aim to be a triple agent,
I'll report an existing mole,

59:23.887 --> 59:25.923
to upset the balance of my agency.

59:27.087 --> 59:29.681
- I'm not trying to play you.
- We'll see.

59:30.967 --> 59:32.878
I have an instinct.

59:40.767 --> 59:43.884
You need a dentist. Do you have one?
I can get you a name.

59:43.967 --> 59:46.083
I'm all right.

59:48.287 --> 59:49.686
I'll be right back.

01:00:40.247 --> 01:00:44.320
- I wanted to say I was sorry.
- You don't have to.

01:00:46.287 --> 01:00:48.881
I'm back at work.
I guess you know that.

01:00:49.367 --> 01:00:51.437
I meant sorry about Danny.

01:00:52.487 --> 01:00:54.682
There was nothing I could do.

01:00:54.767 --> 01:00:57.600
I'd like to be alone,
if you don't mind.

01:01:00.887 --> 01:01:03.003
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

01:01:03.087 --> 01:01:07.205
I don't know what you expect.
Just because we're on the same side,

01:01:07.287 --> 01:01:12.680
just because I know the truth now,
it doesn't change a thing between us.

01:01:14.687 --> 01:01:17.485
I accept what I'm doing now
because I have to.

01:01:19.887 --> 01:01:22.526
That doesn't mean
I have to accept you.

01:01:28.487 --> 01:01:31.684
I asked Devlin
if I could come tell you myself.

01:01:34.087 --> 01:01:36.885
They verified your statement.
You're in.

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:41.000
I read what you wrote.

01:01:42.287 --> 01:01:46.280
I appreciate your not naming me.
That was... kind.

01:01:51.887 --> 01:01:53.525
You're CIA.

01:01:54.287 --> 01:01:57.279
You don't know
how dangerous this is, Sydney,

01:01:57.367 --> 01:01:59.483
doing what I do.

01:02:00.487 --> 01:02:02.796
I wish you'd taken me up
on Switzerland.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:07.557
How do I know
what you're telling me is the truth?

01:02:11.287 --> 01:02:14.438
I guess we'll just have to learn
to trust each other.

01:02:51.287 --> 01:02:52.879
