WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:08.213
Captain's log, star date 41723.9.

00:08.380 --> 00:12.467
Following a Starfleet order, we
are in the Xendi Sabu star system,

00:12.634 --> 00:16.763
having rendezvoused with a Ferengi
vessel which requested a meeting.

00:16.930 --> 00:20.809
Although we arrived and made
appropriate signals three days ago,

00:20.976 --> 00:23.853
the Ferengi have responded
only with the message,

00:24.020 --> 00:25.814
"Stand by, Enterprise. "

00:29.859 --> 00:31.653
You sent for me, sir?

00:32.988 --> 00:35.198
Yes, Doctor. Sit down.

00:41.121 --> 00:44.708
Look, this...
perhaps may be nothing,

00:44.874 --> 00:46.876
but I've been feeling...

00:47.586 --> 00:49.379
..a bit odd of late.

00:51.965 --> 00:55.844
Fatigued. And now I've got
this damned headache.

00:56.011 --> 00:57.178
A what?

00:58.013 --> 01:00.390
Headache.
You know what a headache is.

01:00.557 --> 01:04.185
Of course.
But I don't often encounter them.

01:06.354 --> 01:10.859
The reason is obvious, of course.
What are the Ferengi up to?

01:11.026 --> 01:13.695
"Stand by, Enterprise."
Stand by for what?

01:13.862 --> 01:15.363
I don't see a thing wrong.

01:15.530 --> 01:19.659
No, neither can l. Unless they're
baiting some kind of trap.

01:19.826 --> 01:21.494
With your head.

01:23.246 --> 01:27.667
I see nothing physically wrong,
but I'll run some scans in sickbay.

01:27.834 --> 01:31.171
- All I've got...
- Is an order. Report to sickbay!

01:31.796 --> 01:35.175
From the only person aboard
who can give you an order.

01:35.342 --> 01:39.220
Captain, from First Officer.
They're sending a message.

01:39.387 --> 01:41.222
On my way, Number One.

01:41.806 --> 01:43.642
Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls.

01:47.437 --> 01:51.149
- They're prepared to talk, sir.
- Have they explained the wait?

01:51.316 --> 01:55.403
Negative. They've identified
their commander as Bok. DaiMon Bok.

01:55.570 --> 01:58.531
You can see him.
They're communicating on visual.

01:58.698 --> 02:00.408
Open hailing frequencies.

02:00.992 --> 02:02.494
Frequencies open, sir.

02:02.661 --> 02:05.830
This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard
of the Enterprise.

02:05.997 --> 02:07.916
We are transmitting visually.

02:09.876 --> 02:12.671
Is this the Capt Picard?

02:13.713 --> 02:17.175
- Do we know each other?
- I know you, Picard.

02:17.884 --> 02:20.929
Then you have the advantage of me.
Is this Bok?

02:21.513 --> 02:24.683
I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi.

02:25.809 --> 02:30.939
I have asked you here to discuss
a mutual problem, Captain.

02:31.523 --> 02:32.941
What problem, DaiMon Bok?

02:33.608 --> 02:37.737
I insist on speaking
of that matter in person.

02:38.947 --> 02:42.033
Shall we meet on your vessel...
or mine?

02:46.746 --> 02:48.665
Hailing frequencies closed.

02:49.791 --> 02:53.587
I sense considerable deception
on Bok's part. And danger.

02:53.753 --> 02:57.340
Then we should meet him here.
Keep him under our control.

02:58.842 --> 03:00.552
Now open, sir.

03:01.052 --> 03:04.723
I appreciate your offer, DaiMon Bok.
Please be our guest here.

03:04.889 --> 03:06.808
As you wish, Picard.

03:07.517 --> 03:13.189
Perhaps this will begin a new era
of cooperation for both our peoples.

03:13.356 --> 03:15.025
In one Earth hour, then?

03:15.859 --> 03:19.195
In one hour, DaiMon Bok.
End transmission.

03:22.073 --> 03:24.576
I can't believe
they're coming here.

03:26.911 --> 03:28.914
They did agree a bit easily.

03:29.623 --> 03:32.459
Well, in one hour we shall know why.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:58.193 --> 04:01.279
Space, the final frontier.

04:02.989 --> 04:06.910
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

04:07.077 --> 04:11.164
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

04:12.999 --> 04:16.670
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

04:17.587 --> 04:21.257
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:27.449 --> 05:29.993
Are you accustomed to
getting your own way?

05:30.160 --> 05:35.290
Only when it makes sense. There's 40
minutes until the Ferengi beam over.

05:35.457 --> 05:37.500
I'll have these scans done in ten.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.253
A lot of effort
for a simple headache.

05:40.420 --> 05:44.424
You should not have
a headache unless something's wrong.

05:44.591 --> 05:47.385
It's true that headaches
were once quite common,

05:47.552 --> 05:51.890
before the brain was charted, before
we understood the nature of pain.

05:52.307 --> 05:55.352
When we suffered from things
such as the common cold.

05:55.518 --> 06:00.106
- So what's the cause of my headache?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

06:05.820 --> 06:07.614
Feel better?

06:09.783 --> 06:12.118
- The pain's gone.
- Medical fakery.

06:12.285 --> 06:15.747
The pain is actually still there.
It's just cloaked.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.627
- I'll want further exams.
- Doctor!

06:20.794 --> 06:23.213
When the Ferengi matter is settled.

06:26.883 --> 06:28.802
Expect an intruder alert.

06:28.969 --> 06:31.096
What? Have you something to report?

06:31.263 --> 06:33.682
If you'll scan heading 44,
mark 163...

06:33.848 --> 06:36.101
Intruder alert, sir.

06:36.268 --> 06:38.061
I've got something, sir.

06:39.396 --> 06:43.817
An old-style starship, Constellation
class, travelling on impulse power.

06:43.984 --> 06:45.568
Says who?

06:46.778 --> 06:49.531
Ensign, answer
the First Officer's question.

06:50.865 --> 06:55.287
Says the long-distance sensors, sir.
I was boosting the sensor output...

06:55.453 --> 06:57.831
Boosting it? How?

07:00.375 --> 07:02.210
We will discuss this later.

07:02.377 --> 07:05.589
I'm reading it now,
as a Constellation-class starship

07:05.755 --> 07:09.301
travelling under impulse power.
Sending no call letters.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.428
The correct procedure...

07:15.515 --> 07:17.183
What's wrong, sir?

07:17.350 --> 07:20.937
It's nothing.
It's just a... mild headache.

07:23.189 --> 07:27.193
The correct procedure, Ensign,
was to signal the bridge immediately.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.821
- Yes, sir.
- Bringing it here personally,

07:29.988 --> 07:32.991
perhaps to be on hand
for the Ferengi beam-over,

07:33.158 --> 07:36.286
might have imperilled us
were it something hostile.

07:36.453 --> 07:37.412
Yes, sir.

07:37.579 --> 07:40.749
Receiving no signal
from the approaching starship.

07:43.418 --> 07:45.128
Time, sir.

07:45.295 --> 07:46.838
Time?

07:47.797 --> 07:49.799
For the Ferengi beam-over.

07:50.717 --> 07:53.887
Do you see any problem
connected with this old starship?

07:54.054 --> 07:56.640
It's safer to have the Ferengi here,
whatever.

07:56.806 --> 07:58.892
Concur. Stand by.

07:59.059 --> 08:00.644
Hailing frequencies open.

08:14.699 --> 08:16.618
Welcome in peace, DaiMon Bok.

08:16.785 --> 08:19.329
It is our pleasure, Capt Picard.

08:19.496 --> 08:25.502
Might I introduce my First Officer,
Kazago, and my Second, Rata?

08:25.669 --> 08:29.631
This is my First Officer,
Cmdr William Riker.

08:29.798 --> 08:33.092
Second-in-command, Data.
Counsellor Troi.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.929
We have heard that you use females.

08:37.222 --> 08:40.933
Clothed females. Most interesting.

08:42.602 --> 08:46.731
- They are that, sir.
- And the android was mentioned, too.

08:46.898 --> 08:51.444
What is its price?
We should like to... purchase it.

08:51.611 --> 08:55.407
He is not for sale. Cmdr Data is...

08:57.742 --> 09:00.745
Second-hand merchandise.
You wouldn't want him.

09:01.621 --> 09:03.415
Second-hand, sir?

09:06.126 --> 09:08.378
Of course. A human joke.

09:09.546 --> 09:14.551
Excuse me, Captain. The unidentified
starship is coming. Still no signal.

09:14.718 --> 09:18.722
Think nothing of it.
It is under our control.

09:18.888 --> 09:21.349
One of our starships
under your control?

09:21.516 --> 09:23.435
Do not be alarmed, Captain.

09:24.561 --> 09:30.692
It is a gift from us. With which
we honour the hero of Maxia.

09:32.277 --> 09:34.863
- Who?
- Why you, Picard, of course.

09:36.448 --> 09:39.951
Do you not remember
the Battle of Maxia?

09:40.118 --> 09:44.080
I'm sorry, I do not remember it,
DaiMon Bok. Data?

09:44.247 --> 09:49.920
He may refer to an encounter nine
years ago, in the Maxia Zeta system.

09:50.086 --> 09:54.174
- An unidentified starship...
- Unidentified?!

09:55.759 --> 09:58.511
That fine vessel was Ferengi.

09:58.678 --> 10:01.181
Which... you destroyed, sir.

10:03.558 --> 10:05.560
The Battle of Maxia.

10:05.727 --> 10:08.688
I never heard it referred to
so dramatically before.

10:10.148 --> 10:14.945
My sincere regrets, but that vessel
refused to identify itself.

10:15.111 --> 10:18.281
It simply attacked us.
We defended ourselves.

10:18.448 --> 10:22.160
Such... mistakes happen in space.

10:22.327 --> 10:26.414
Hardly a mistake, sir. Your report
shows it deliberately attacked.

10:26.581 --> 10:30.835
Do you want arriving vessel on main
viewer? It's 1,000 kilometers away.

10:31.002 --> 10:32.504
Put it on your viewer.

10:33.171 --> 10:34.172
Main viewer.

10:34.839 --> 10:37.050
There is no one aboard it.

10:37.217 --> 10:41.596
The log should be downloaded
into the Enterprise's records.

10:41.763 --> 10:43.515
At a price.

10:43.682 --> 10:45.183
No price!

10:45.350 --> 10:46.851
No price?

10:47.018 --> 10:49.771
What is the purpose of this? What...

10:56.194 --> 10:57.946
I felt something too, Captain.

10:58.113 --> 11:01.783
Perhaps it is... his conscience.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.535
Bridge to sickbay...

11:03.702 --> 11:05.412
No, I'm fine.

11:05.579 --> 11:09.457
It felt as if...
it were something from your past.

11:11.126 --> 11:12.919
It's alright. I'm fine.

11:15.088 --> 11:16.464
What is this about?

11:17.173 --> 11:21.052
It is about the battle
I mentioned, Captain.

11:22.053 --> 11:24.598
A gift, in honour of that occasion.

11:25.724 --> 11:28.476
Look at that ship closely.

11:29.144 --> 11:32.522
- Magnify it, please, Lt. La Forge.
- Aye, sir.

11:38.445 --> 11:39.821
Why,...

11:43.116 --> 11:45.368
..it's the Stargazer.

11:45.535 --> 11:47.329
It's my old ship.

11:50.332 --> 11:51.917
How did you find it?

11:52.083 --> 11:57.839
It was a derelict. Adrift in space
on the far side of this star system.

11:58.006 --> 12:01.927
How it got there
is none of my business, Captain.

12:02.928 --> 12:08.475
But now,... that vessel is yours,
if you wish to have it.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.229
We are not selling it to him?

12:13.980 --> 12:18.109
Consider it...
an act of friendship.

12:18.276 --> 12:20.695
At no cost?

12:21.613 --> 12:24.866
Ugly! Very ugly!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.751
Captain's log, supplemental.

12:33.918 --> 12:36.796
Bok and his officers
have returned to their vessel,

12:36.963 --> 12:39.882
inviting us to take possession
of the Stargazer.

12:40.049 --> 12:43.386
- Like before?
- No, it hit with more impact.

12:43.553 --> 12:47.223
Hit? I'm sorry,
but anything could be important.

12:47.390 --> 12:50.727
- You felt something yourself?
- I believe so.

12:50.893 --> 12:55.148
Like a thought,
but... rather mechanical in nature.

12:55.315 --> 12:57.442
Sure it wasn't one of my thoughts?

12:57.608 --> 13:01.946
At that moment, I was remembering
being at the helm of the Stargazer.

13:02.113 --> 13:05.033
A manoeuvre was being made.
We were hit.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.660
Something's burning.

13:08.578 --> 13:10.288
I can smell smoke. Can you?

13:12.540 --> 13:14.751
There's nothing burning, Jean-Luc.

13:17.211 --> 13:19.756
That was just part of my memory.

13:20.673 --> 13:22.884
Memory or nightmare?

13:24.177 --> 13:27.930
It was strong, whatever it was.
Ready, Number One?

13:28.097 --> 13:30.892
Staff's waiting,
if Dr. Crusher approves.

13:31.059 --> 13:33.436
I'll do better than that.
I'll go along.

13:37.106 --> 13:40.193
We were travelling
through the Maxia system.

13:40.360 --> 13:44.614
An unidentified ship appeared
and fired on us, point-blank range.

13:44.781 --> 13:46.240
Where did it come from?

13:46.407 --> 13:49.994
It must have been lying
in some deep moon crater.

13:50.161 --> 13:54.165
First attack damaged the shields.
In the confusion, they hit us again.

13:54.332 --> 13:57.502
- No clue who they were?
- No names, no reason.

13:57.669 --> 14:02.090
Can you identify them, Vigo?
lf they come a second time...

14:02.256 --> 14:03.341
Sir, who's Vigo?

14:03.508 --> 14:05.635
My weapons officer on the Stargazer.

14:10.932 --> 14:12.934
I'm getting caught up in this.

14:13.851 --> 14:15.937
Your shields were failing, sir.

14:17.230 --> 14:19.399
I... improvised.

14:19.565 --> 14:22.443
With the enemy vessel
coming in for the kill,

14:22.610 --> 14:26.197
I ordered a sensor bearing.
When it made the return arc...

14:26.364 --> 14:30.493
You performed what Starfleet texts
now call the Picard Manoeuvre.

14:30.660 --> 14:33.079
I did what any good helmsman would.

14:33.246 --> 14:38.209
Dropped into high warp, stopped
right off the enemy's bow, and fired!

14:38.376 --> 14:40.128
Blowing into maximum warp,

14:40.295 --> 14:43.840
you appeared for an instant
to be in two places at once.

14:44.007 --> 14:46.092
Our attacker fired on the wrong one.

14:46.801 --> 14:50.596
"I did what any good helmsman would"!
You did it first, sir.

14:50.763 --> 14:53.433
It was a save-our-skins manoeuvre.

14:55.351 --> 14:57.687
We were finished. On fire.

14:57.854 --> 14:59.856
We had to abandon ship.

15:00.023 --> 15:04.444
We limped through space in shuttles
for weeks before we were picked up.

15:06.195 --> 15:09.782
I haven't thought about this
for years.

15:09.949 --> 15:14.037
Sir, the Ferengi are waiting for us
to take possession of the Stargazer.

15:14.954 --> 15:18.625
- I want to go over to her.
- I understand, sir.

15:18.791 --> 15:21.502
As soon as my people
make sure she's safe.

15:21.669 --> 15:24.339
And after I have another look at you.

15:57.497 --> 15:59.707
USS Stargazer.

15:59.874 --> 16:01.709
Constellation class.

16:01.876 --> 16:06.381
Starfleet Registry NCC-2893.

16:10.426 --> 16:14.931
I activated the emergency power
cells. Amazing they still work.

16:17.934 --> 16:21.604
The rest of this ship is clear
of surprises, Lt. Yar.

16:22.313 --> 16:27.443
I read of this ship at the Academy.
I never dreamed I'd ever be on her.

16:27.610 --> 16:29.779
Yar to Enterprise. All clear, sir.

16:49.424 --> 16:51.009
Hello, old friend.

17:10.444 --> 17:13.239
You'll find this
most intriguing, sir.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.199
What did you find, Data?

17:15.366 --> 17:18.536
The last entry,
dated nine years ago, sir. By you.

17:20.496 --> 17:23.333
"We are forced to abandon
our starship."

17:23.499 --> 17:26.044
"May she find her way without us."

17:26.752 --> 17:28.253
Apparently she did, sir.

17:33.009 --> 17:36.596
- How do you feel, Captain?
- I'm fine, Doctor.

17:36.763 --> 17:41.059
Lt. Yar, run a structural analysis on
the Stargazer for an impulse tow.

17:41.225 --> 17:44.604
Data, download all computers
to the Enterprise and file.

17:46.648 --> 17:49.317
I'm going to look at my old cabin.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.302
Try this, hero of Maxia!

18:27.647 --> 18:29.023
Captain?

18:29.816 --> 18:34.445
Another headache? This worries me.
I want you back on the Enterprise.

18:34.612 --> 18:35.697
But my things...

18:35.863 --> 18:38.825
I'll see they're sent
to your Enterprise quarters.

18:45.915 --> 18:49.669
Enterprise now taking possession
of Stargazer, Kazago.

18:49.836 --> 18:51.671
Permission granted.

18:53.298 --> 18:57.427
It was quite a bargain. I thought
the Ferengi always made a profit.

19:01.848 --> 19:04.183
Sub warp speed for towing, La Forge.

19:04.350 --> 19:05.518
Aye, sir.

19:08.938 --> 19:11.107
Starfleet has answered our request.

19:11.274 --> 19:16.279
A tug will meet us and tow the
Stargazer back to Xendi Star base 9.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.031
Very well, Data.

19:21.242 --> 19:24.537
- How was it, Captain?
- Very strange, Number One.

19:24.704 --> 19:29.125
Like going back to the house
you grew up in, but no one's home.

19:29.792 --> 19:33.129
- Except phantoms of the past.
- It has troubled you?

19:35.548 --> 19:38.259
Not half as much
as this damned headache.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.430
Take over, Number One.

19:44.182 --> 19:45.183
Aye, sir.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.896
What's wrong?

19:53.983 --> 19:55.777
I wish I could say.

20:21.719 --> 20:24.263
Shields weakening, Captain.

20:24.430 --> 20:25.598
Torpedoes armed.

20:26.891 --> 20:28.518
Where are they?

20:29.435 --> 20:30.937
Oh, my God, sir!

20:31.938 --> 20:33.439
Fire!

20:38.277 --> 20:39.988
What is it, Data?

20:43.199 --> 20:44.575
Why all the mystery?

20:44.742 --> 20:49.789
The records of the Stargazer. What
the Ferengi call the Battle of Maxia.

20:49.956 --> 20:53.584
The Captain's personal log
contains a much different version

20:53.751 --> 20:56.671
of that conflict
than the official account.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.047
What are you saying?

20:58.214 --> 21:01.467
It appears that the starship
which Capt Picard attacked

21:01.634 --> 21:04.804
- had been under a flag of truce.
- What?

21:04.971 --> 21:08.474
He destroyed the ship
without notice or provocation.

21:08.641 --> 21:11.227
What about the fire on the Stargazer?

21:11.394 --> 21:14.105
- An accident in Engineering.
- And what proof?

21:14.272 --> 21:16.941
It is logged in his own voice, sir.

21:19.777 --> 21:22.113
Would you care to hear it, sir?

21:23.531 --> 21:24.616
Sir?

21:32.081 --> 21:34.584
This is a confession given by me,

21:34.751 --> 21:38.046
Jean-Luc Picard,
commanding USS Stargazer.

21:38.212 --> 21:41.549
- What is this?
- I don't know. Sounds like you.

21:41.716 --> 21:45.094
- It is!
- I refuse to believe you said that.

21:45.928 --> 21:50.642
I must have mistaken their subspace
antenna for a weapons cluster.

21:50.808 --> 21:53.561
Unfortunately,
I fired our main phasers

21:53.728 --> 21:57.774
and our direct hit
destroyed the unknown vessel.

21:57.940 --> 22:02.820
I assume they simulated your voice.
I already put Data to work on it.

22:03.655 --> 22:09.077
I never made that log entry, but
it leaves you with a duty to perform.

22:10.536 --> 22:13.498
I know, sir.
I must report to Starfleet.

22:13.665 --> 22:17.126
That's at least one day
for communication to reach there.

22:17.293 --> 22:20.463
And one more day
for their answer to return.

22:22.423 --> 22:27.512
I'd like the truth of this by then.
I'd hate to prepare a formal defence.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.807
- They can't ask for your command.
- Why not?

22:30.974 --> 22:33.935
With the Ferengi making
friendship overtures,

22:34.102 --> 22:36.813
I'd be
a severe embarrassment to Starfleet.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.774
I'm sure the Ferengi
are behind the faked log.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.068
No wonder they're waiting out there.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.444
Headache back, sir?

22:44.529 --> 22:46.114
Damn!

22:47.407 --> 22:49.158
I'll call the Doctor again.

22:49.325 --> 22:52.996
It's no wonder, with all this
going on. Try to relax.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.465
This is a confession given by me,

23:04.632 --> 23:07.593
Jean-Luc Picard,
commanding USS Stargazer,

23:07.760 --> 23:12.181
in the hopes that my belated honesty
will be considered by Starfleet,

23:12.348 --> 23:15.101
when judging my actions
during a confrontation

23:15.268 --> 23:17.103
with an unidentified vessel.

23:17.770 --> 23:20.315
Open hailing frequencies, Geordi.

23:20.481 --> 23:23.443
I'll take it in the ready room.
Secure channel.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.571
Secure, sir.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.116
Starship Ferengi,
this is Cmdr Riker here.

23:30.283 --> 23:33.161
I'd like to speak to
First Officer Kazago.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.121
A problem, Riker?

23:35.288 --> 23:36.664
Are our channels secure?

23:38.458 --> 23:40.126
It is now.

23:40.293 --> 23:43.046
You know the details
of the Battle of Maxia?

23:43.212 --> 23:45.673
Capt Bok has made me aware of it.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.509
The infamy of your Picard
is now known.

23:48.635 --> 23:49.594
Infamy?

23:49.761 --> 23:54.641
I'd call the wanton destruction
of an unarmed vessel infamy.

23:54.807 --> 23:57.018
And if I produced evidence

23:57.185 --> 24:00.271
that Capt. Picard's log entry
was falsified...

24:00.438 --> 24:04.317
I hardly imagine you contacted me
to discuss an ancient battle.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.153
- What do you want of me?
- One question.

24:08.029 --> 24:11.115
As you humans say, I'm all ears.

24:11.282 --> 24:13.952
First Officer to First Officer,
Kazago.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.997
If your Capt Bok knew about this,

24:18.164 --> 24:21.542
why this peaceful meeting
to present the Stargazer?

24:22.126 --> 24:27.256
We give back your derelict warship
and you accuse us of crime, Riker?

24:27.423 --> 24:29.968
I can bear no more insults!

24:39.018 --> 24:41.020
Yes, who the hell is it?

24:43.815 --> 24:48.111
- Not resting, Captain?
- More like dying, Doctor.

24:48.277 --> 24:49.779
Over here.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.620
What is wrong with me?

24:57.787 --> 25:02.500
I wish to hell I knew, but something
unusual is definitely happening.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.545
Doctors say the obvious
like it's a revelation.

25:05.712 --> 25:08.256
Captains always act
like they're immortal.

25:13.219 --> 25:14.929
No!

25:34.824 --> 25:37.869
You didn't tell me
it had been this bad.

25:38.036 --> 25:41.205
It wasn't this bad.
But it's getting worse.

25:41.372 --> 25:43.166
This should help a little.

25:50.757 --> 25:54.844
It must be some emotional pressure
connected with the Stargazer.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.347
I got this headache

25:57.513 --> 26:01.100
long before I even knew
my old ship still existed.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.939
Still, perhaps you're partly right.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.485
Want to talk about it?

26:11.402 --> 26:13.363
I'm here.

26:14.113 --> 26:19.369
The fight at Maxia. I destroyed
an entire vessel. An entire crew.

26:20.995 --> 26:22.580
Did you have a choice?

26:23.289 --> 26:25.667
I don't know any more. I don't know.

26:28.294 --> 26:31.255
Cmdr Riker told me
about the altered log

26:31.422 --> 26:33.091
if that's troubling you.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.429
The last three nights, I've...

26:40.181 --> 26:41.975
..I’ve heard these voices.

26:44.143 --> 26:46.813
I'm on the bridge of my old ship.

26:47.689 --> 26:51.567
There's fire all around me.
The klaxons, smoke.

26:53.319 --> 26:55.321
And then I give the order.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.742
And now the Stargazer
is really here.

27:00.618 --> 27:03.454
And that log... Am I going crazy?

27:06.791 --> 27:11.587
Was I in my right mind at Maxia?
Am I in my right mind now?

27:22.724 --> 27:24.642
What was that?

27:24.809 --> 27:27.020
Something to let you sleep.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.859
Yes, sleep.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.286
Sleep...

28:16.736 --> 28:18.863
Shields weakening, Captain!

28:19.030 --> 28:21.032
Torpedoes armed.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.534
Where are they?

28:31.960 --> 28:37.048
And now, my dear Captain,
you are ready to live the past.

28:40.301 --> 28:42.303
Where did they come from?

28:42.470 --> 28:44.806
Phasers, sir?

28:49.477 --> 28:51.479
What should we do, sir?

28:51.646 --> 28:53.564
Should we fire back?

28:54.482 --> 28:56.192
Fire, Captain?

28:59.070 --> 29:01.489
You will injure yourself,

29:01.656 --> 29:04.325
as you once injured me.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.664
Sir!

29:11.165 --> 29:12.875
Damage report.

29:13.042 --> 29:18.089
Fusion generator under surge
control, sir! Power systems failing.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.591
Sensor beam bearing on hostile ship!

29:20.758 --> 29:22.343
Seven, mark 19, sir.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.430
Phasers, sir?

29:26.597 --> 29:28.599
Ready phasers, and lock!

29:28.766 --> 29:30.685
Stand by on warp nine.

29:30.852 --> 29:35.273
Heading,... seven-seven, mark 20.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.192
Engage!

29:40.153 --> 29:41.738
Steady!

29:42.447 --> 29:44.032
Now, reverse and stop!

29:44.657 --> 29:46.534
Phasers fire, torpedoes away!

29:55.585 --> 29:57.170
Fire.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.308
By comparing
the Stargazer's main computer log

30:10.475 --> 30:12.393
with Capt Picard's personal log,

30:12.560 --> 30:15.021
I found some discrepancies, sir.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.356
What does that mean?

30:16.522 --> 30:20.943
All information is time-coded.
The bits produce an aggregate...

30:21.110 --> 30:24.656
I don't want a computer-science
lesson. Bottom line.

30:24.822 --> 30:27.158
One of these two logs is a forgery.

30:27.325 --> 30:31.037
Correction. The log just found
aboard the Stargazer is a forgery.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.791
As I said, that is one of them,
is it not?

30:36.209 --> 30:37.210
Captain!

30:39.754 --> 30:41.339
You're looking better, sir.

30:41.506 --> 30:45.301
A little sleep, thanks to
the good Doctor, works wonders.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.346
What report on the logs?

30:48.513 --> 30:51.474
Whoever tampered
with your log was clever.

30:51.641 --> 30:54.435
But clumsy.
It's definitely a fabrication.

30:55.812 --> 31:00.858
Number One, I'd like you to take
a look at this brain-scan graph...

31:01.025 --> 31:04.237
- What are you doing here?
- Aren't I the Captain?

31:04.404 --> 31:06.990
- Yes, but...
- Thank you for the confirmation.

31:07.490 --> 31:11.661
But now, except for Riker, if you'd
all return to your stations.

31:12.578 --> 31:14.706
- Is that clear?
- Sir.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.131
You too, Doctor. I have business
with the Commander.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.758
Under protest, sir.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.391
You have orders for me?

31:33.558 --> 31:36.519
Release the Stargazer
from the tractor beam.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.022
- Sir?
- The tractor beam.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.565
Sir, are you abandoning?

31:40.732 --> 31:44.277
No. But her inertia will carry
the Stargazer along with us.

31:45.486 --> 31:48.281
Or did you sleep through
the Academy lecture

31:48.448 --> 31:51.409
on the conservation
of tractor-beam power?

31:51.576 --> 31:54.537
No, sir. I'll release her, of course.

32:10.053 --> 32:13.097
Obviously, there's some
thought-process disorder.

32:13.264 --> 32:16.851
But I can't find
a physical reason for it. Anything?

32:17.769 --> 32:21.356
I'm puzzled, too.
I keep sensing random thoughts.

32:21.522 --> 32:25.068
But two sets of them.
As if they were his,

32:25.234 --> 32:28.446
but intermixed with other thoughts
which are also his.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.952
- I'm busy, Wesley.
- I know, but this is important.

32:34.118 --> 32:37.789
I was at the sensors in Engineering,
trying sensitivity tests...

32:37.956 --> 32:40.833
Does this have something
to do with Capt Picard?

32:41.000 --> 32:44.003
Yes, ma'am. If this is
what you're talking about.

32:44.879 --> 32:48.341
I don't know about brain scans,
but I glanced at these.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.386
I noticed that these patterns
are the same

32:51.552 --> 32:55.348
as the low-intensity transmissions
from the Ferengi ship.

32:55.515 --> 32:59.310
I went back and checked.
They're exactly the same.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.771
- What kind of transmissions?
- I don't know.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.315
Engineering has nothing like it
on record.

33:04.482 --> 33:09.487
- Let's get to the Captain.
- No, they may affect him. To Riker.

33:13.032 --> 33:14.826
You're welcome, ladies.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.537
Adults!

33:24.627 --> 33:26.045
The Captain?

33:26.212 --> 33:29.716
Resting, after ordering you
to return to your duty stations.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.303
There have been some...
Did he say low intensity?

33:34.595 --> 33:38.516
Unusual low-intensity transmissions
from the Ferengi vessel.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.143
- Did who say?
- My son.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.353
Transmissions which exactly match

33:42.520 --> 33:45.606
certain anomalies found
in the Captain's scans.

33:45.773 --> 33:50.069
Something over there is affecting
the Captain's thought patterns.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.991
Computer, give me a location
on Capt Picard.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.577
Capt Picard
is in transporter room three.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.496
What?

34:00.663 --> 34:03.625
Emergency order
to transporter room three.

34:03.791 --> 34:08.838
New information. Capt Picard
is no longer aboard the Enterprise.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.366
Welcome back, Captain.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.868
What is happening?

34:39.034 --> 34:40.954
Shields up, computer.

34:43.331 --> 34:47.418
- What are you doing?
- Collecting on an old debt.

34:51.755 --> 34:54.092
Stargazer, Captain, respond!

34:54.257 --> 34:56.719
Shields up. No way to beam over.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.305
I'm reading something
very strange here.

34:59.472 --> 35:03.351
A low-intensity beam of intermittent
pulse, inside this starship.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.561
I have a fix on it, sir.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.564
Inside Capt Picard's quarters.

35:09.983 --> 35:12.986
You transferred his belongings
from the Stargazer?

35:13.152 --> 35:15.989
Yes.
Including a fairly heavy chest.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.532
Take a look, fast!

35:17.699 --> 35:21.160
Commander,
Stargazer is now powering up, sir.

35:26.332 --> 35:32.588
I have been waiting a long
nine years for this, Picard.

35:35.675 --> 35:39.595
- I don't know what you mean.
- Do you not, human?

35:41.514 --> 35:46.644
Can you not remember the crime
you committed against my very blood?

35:47.562 --> 35:52.275
- You murdered my only son!
- Your son?

35:52.442 --> 35:56.029
He was commander of the ship
you destroyed.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.156
On his first voyage as DaiMon.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.408
The ship...?

36:00.575 --> 36:03.745
The Ferengi vessel
that attacked me.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.373
Or is it about to attack me?

36:07.540 --> 36:12.086
And I have spent these years,
searching,... seeking,...

36:13.004 --> 36:15.006
..a proper blood revenge!

36:16.966 --> 36:19.218
And I found it!

36:24.974 --> 36:27.101
I am rich, Picard.

36:28.019 --> 36:32.523
Yet, two of these cost me
the profits of an entire life!

36:33.316 --> 36:37.320
You are back in command
of the Stargazer, Picard.

36:38.112 --> 36:41.491
Its computers will answer
your orders.

36:44.577 --> 36:47.121
Die well, Captain!

36:54.587 --> 36:58.508
First Officer's log. Capt Picard has
beamed aboard the Stargazer,

36:58.675 --> 37:01.678
which is moving away from us
under its own power.

37:01.886 --> 37:05.014
Enterprise to Stargazer,
please respond!

37:13.940 --> 37:18.444
Enterprise to Capt Picard
aboard Stargazer. Please answer!

37:23.116 --> 37:25.451
Data,
what was Stargazer's condition?

37:25.618 --> 37:30.456
Fire damage to interior surfaces,
but no main systems were crippled.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.791
Armaments, Lt. Yar?

37:31.958 --> 37:33.751
Six photon torpedoes short

37:33.918 --> 37:36.963
from when the Captain destroyed
the Ferengi.

37:37.900 --> 37:39.526
Otherwise fully armed.

37:40.360 --> 37:44.239
- What is it, La Forge?
- A network of miniature circuitry.

37:44.406 --> 37:47.993
Incredibly complex.
Maybe an amplifier.

37:52.247 --> 37:54.666
Where was it
in the Captain's quarters?

37:54.833 --> 37:59.254
His chest from the Stargazer, sir?
Where I left it. He hadn't unpacked.

37:59.421 --> 38:01.673
He may not have known it was there.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.969
If this can pick up or magnify
thought-altering transmissions...

38:06.136 --> 38:08.806
It could prepare him
for what's happening now.

38:08.972 --> 38:11.350
Let's find out. Or try to.

38:11.517 --> 38:13.977
Contact the Ferengi vessel,
Lieutenant.

38:14.144 --> 38:16.063
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

38:16.230 --> 38:20.526
Enterprise to Ferengi vessel.
We transmit visually. Do you respond?

38:22.069 --> 38:25.030
Why is our gift to you
under power, human?

38:25.197 --> 38:29.284
- I'll discuss it with your Captain.
- He is in our laboratory.

38:29.451 --> 38:31.245
Where is your Captain?

38:31.412 --> 38:33.372
He's beamed aboard the Stargazer.

38:33.539 --> 38:36.750
I'm wondering if this
has something to do with it.

38:38.335 --> 38:40.546
How do you have possession
of that?

38:40.713 --> 38:44.258
It was in our Captain's chest,
from the Stargazer.

38:45.217 --> 38:49.430
It is a forbidden device.
A... thought-maker.

38:49.596 --> 38:52.683
If your Captain
is criminal enough to own one...

38:52.850 --> 38:55.978
You know who controls
those spheres.

38:56.145 --> 39:00.899
I ask you again. First Officer
to First Officer. What's going on?

39:01.817 --> 39:06.530
It is not seemly to question
one's own DaiMon, Riker.

39:06.697 --> 39:08.824
I am not prepared to do that.

39:08.991 --> 39:11.702
- Sir, I have the Stargazer.
- Switch, now!

39:13.662 --> 39:16.206
Enterprise to Picard.

39:16.373 --> 39:20.377
Do not attack again!
We're on a peaceful mission!

39:21.086 --> 39:22.713
Give your identity!

39:23.797 --> 39:26.008
You force us to defend ourselves.

39:27.342 --> 39:29.136
Phasers full up.

39:29.303 --> 39:31.638
Arm torpedoes.

39:31.805 --> 39:34.141
Why aren't the shields
at full power?

39:37.352 --> 39:41.231
- We've lost him, sir.
- When he put up the shields.

39:44.777 --> 39:48.113
Damn! I said get the fusion
generators under surge control!

39:48.280 --> 39:50.616
You're moving much too slowly!

39:50.783 --> 39:52.493
Arm the torpedoes, man!

39:54.870 --> 39:57.539
Vigo, get a fire-control party
up here!

39:59.124 --> 40:01.043
Shields weakening, Captain.

40:02.169 --> 40:04.171
Fusion generator on line.

40:04.338 --> 40:07.508
- Weapons report?
- Phasers coming to full charge.

40:07.674 --> 40:08.967
Torpedoes armed.

40:09.885 --> 40:13.138
Who are they? Identify them.

40:13.305 --> 40:16.058
They're coming
for a third pass at us.

40:16.225 --> 40:18.394
We can't take another hit, Captain.

40:21.563 --> 40:24.733
Sir, I now feel anger
from our Captain.

40:25.526 --> 40:28.278
Fury over
whatever he is reliving out there.

40:28.445 --> 40:30.531
The Battle of Maxia, sir.

40:31.031 --> 40:33.826
The Picard Manoeuvre.
What is the defence, Data?

40:33.992 --> 40:37.037
- There is no defence, sir.
- Devise one. Fast!

40:41.708 --> 40:44.753
First Officer Kazago
to human Riker.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.004
Not now, Kazago.

40:46.171 --> 40:48.507
We do not wish to become involved

40:48.674 --> 40:51.176
in what is clearly
a Federation matter.

40:51.343 --> 40:53.595
Fine, fine. Enterprise out.

40:53.762 --> 40:57.474
You should know that DaiMon Bok
no longer commands this vessel.

41:00.144 --> 41:02.354
His First Officer has confined him

41:02.521 --> 41:06.108
for engaging in
this unprofitable venture.

41:07.860 --> 41:10.070
Good luck, First Officer Riker.

41:14.324 --> 41:16.577
I have computed a possibility.

41:16.744 --> 41:18.829
Deep space contains trace gases.

41:18.996 --> 41:22.374
A vessel in the Picard Manoeuvre
might seem to disappear,

41:22.541 --> 41:25.669
but our sensors can locate
compression of these gases.

41:25.836 --> 41:28.338
An aiming point
to blow up our Captain?

41:28.505 --> 41:32.593
This class starship has enough power
to use our tractor beam on it.

41:32.760 --> 41:35.054
Seize it. Limit its field of fire.

41:35.220 --> 41:40.100
Concentrate shields at that point.
Make it so. I hope you're right.

41:40.267 --> 41:42.311
No question of it, sir.

41:44.146 --> 41:45.731
Stand by.

41:51.737 --> 41:53.739
Lock on tractor beam.

41:56.825 --> 41:58.243
Ready phasers.

41:58.410 --> 42:00.537
Capt Picard. Listen to me.

42:04.166 --> 42:07.711
- Vigo, is that you?
- It's Cmdr Riker, sir.

42:07.878 --> 42:10.255
Captain, hear me! Look around.

42:10.422 --> 42:13.133
The Ferengi
are using thought devices on you.

42:13.300 --> 42:15.135
Stand by.

42:17.304 --> 42:18.263
Who is this?

42:18.430 --> 42:23.268
It's Riker, sir. Your Number One.
Look for a silver sphere.

42:25.479 --> 42:27.106
Destroy it with your phaser!

42:37.324 --> 42:38.909
Phaser...

42:42.329 --> 42:43.914
A sphere.

42:46.917 --> 42:48.961
- Bok used it.
- Destroy it!

42:50.045 --> 42:51.630
Phaser...

42:53.465 --> 42:55.050
Destroy the sphere.

43:23.829 --> 43:25.581
Are you alright, Captain?

43:28.208 --> 43:29.793
Captain... ?

43:31.754 --> 43:33.547
Captain, are you alright?

43:39.053 --> 43:41.180
Where am l, Number One?

43:41.346 --> 43:43.140
Aboard the Stargazer, sir.

43:45.726 --> 43:49.063
- The sphere was controlling your...
- Bok!

43:50.105 --> 43:51.482
Where is Bok?

43:51.648 --> 43:55.861
Removed from command. Placed under
guard for his act of vengeance.

43:56.028 --> 43:58.781
Seems there was no profit in it.

43:59.907 --> 44:01.700
In revenge, there never is.

44:08.248 --> 44:11.001
Let the dead rest.

44:11.168 --> 44:12.961
And the past...

44:14.296 --> 44:16.090
..remain the past.

44:20.552 --> 44:22.137
Enterprise, lock on.

44:23.889 --> 44:25.474
Beam me home, Riker.

44:26.305 --> 44:32.602
