<i>(Previously on) "Wrecked"...</i>
I'm going to break you

00:01.776 --> 00:03.600
and watch you hunt each other
to the death.

00:03.650 --> 00:04.833
Jess!

00:04.898 --> 00:06.946
- Where am I?
- She thinks she's in college.

00:07.011 --> 00:09.992
- You live in L.A.?
- Jess has a boner for Pack.

00:10.057 --> 00:11.884
Guys, can we focus, please?

00:11.949 --> 00:14.710
Namely on how we're gonna get out
of this "Hunger Games" knockoff?

00:17.461 --> 00:19.295
Karen, please.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.045
Wait!
Declan told me that...

00:22.362 --> 00:24.418
ErWait, wait. Who was it?!
Who... Who shot him?!

00:24.483 --> 00:25.628
Holy shit.

00:27.408 --> 00:29.512
Guys, can we focus, please?

00:29.577 --> 00:32.371
Namely on how we're gonna get out
of this "Hunger Games" knockoff?

00:32.436 --> 00:36.335
- This can't be real.
- Oh, it's real, pal.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.925
You take my girl,
I take your life.

00:38.990 --> 00:40.752
Todd,
I didn't do anything.

00:40.817 --> 00:42.614
- This is between you and Jess.
- Wrong!

00:42.679 --> 00:44.844
This is between
you and Derek Punchly.

00:44.909 --> 00:46.928
- Who's Derek Punchly?
- My fist!

00:46.993 --> 00:49.529
And he brought his twin brother,
Timmy Cold-cock.

00:49.594 --> 00:52.532
If they're twins, why do they have
different last names, you idiot?

00:52.597 --> 00:54.891
Pack, we should team up. We'll
have a better shot of surviving

00:54.956 --> 00:56.438
if we hunt together.

00:56.503 --> 00:58.281
I mean, not like
together-together.

00:58.346 --> 01:01.164
I mean, unless you, like, wanted
to hunt together-together.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.142
Jess, listen,
I'm very flattered,

01:03.207 --> 01:04.968
but I just don't think
the timing's right.

01:05.033 --> 01:06.813
- Oh, my God. Totally.
- It's not you.

01:06.878 --> 01:09.172
It's just that your ex-husband's
trying to murder me, you know.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.817
Yeah. I mean, this is,
like, whatever?

01:10.882 --> 01:12.842
We should just hunt together
casually, you know.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.954
Hey, Jess. I know you.

01:15.019 --> 01:17.246
You don't actually like
this needle dick.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.559
You just... You always
had a boyfriend.

01:19.624 --> 01:21.640
You don't think you can
do things on your own.

01:21.705 --> 01:23.644
Oh, my God!
That is not true!

01:23.709 --> 01:26.011
I love being alone. You can,
like, really hear your thoughts.

01:26.076 --> 01:29.566
Todd, Jess and I are not hunting
together, I swear!

01:29.631 --> 01:32.877
We wouldn't... This is not...

01:41.163 --> 01:43.354
Pack, wait!

01:51.678 --> 01:53.697
Hell, yeah.

01:53.762 --> 01:55.540
Hey, Pack!

01:55.974 --> 02:00.421
I'm about to go all
Bat-niss Everdeen on your ass.

02:00.734 --> 02:05.356
'Cause of the bat
and... the arrows and...

02:05.580 --> 02:07.289
Whatever! You're dead!

02:09.830 --> 02:12.391
Stop following me! No! I'm
not doing this alone!

02:12.456 --> 02:13.525
I'll literally die!

02:13.590 --> 02:15.562
- Aah!
- Are you okay?

02:15.627 --> 02:17.338
Hey, Pack!

02:17.403 --> 02:19.581
I'm gonna rip your nuts
outta your mouth!

02:19.646 --> 02:21.569
Oh, God! Quick,
cover me in leaves.

02:21.634 --> 02:23.202
It's the only way!
But where should I hide?

02:23.267 --> 02:25.498
Anywhere but here!

02:26.046 --> 02:27.475
Jess, wait!

02:28.849 --> 02:32.243
Can you cover my face?
I can't do it and keep my arms covered.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.712
Thank you!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

02:38.857 --> 02:40.912
Well, well, well.

02:41.927 --> 02:44.296
What do we have...

02:44.598 --> 02:46.231
here?!

02:46.296 --> 02:47.869
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

02:47.934 --> 02:49.786
It's not my fault
Jess likes me.

02:49.851 --> 02:51.356
I'm just really charming.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.216
Yeah, well,
I'm pissed!

02:53.281 --> 02:54.870
And it feels like
your fault,

02:54.935 --> 02:57.246
so I'm just gonna
take it out on you!

02:57.311 --> 02:58.325
Aah!

03:00.545 --> 03:02.739
Oh, my God.
Did I just kill him?

03:07.258 --> 03:08.678
No.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.056
You conked him.
Where did that come from?

03:12.121 --> 03:14.533
Oh, I was in color guard
in high school.

03:14.598 --> 03:17.188
You mean the nerd cheerleaders
that wave big flags around?

03:17.253 --> 03:19.557
Uhh, no.
I mean the cool cheerleaders

03:19.622 --> 03:22.303
who don't dress like hookers.
And we don't wave flags.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.813
We spin them.

03:24.991 --> 03:27.104
Wow. You can
really handle that thing.

03:27.169 --> 03:28.843
I don't want to brag,
but we made state

03:28.908 --> 03:30.516
with this killer
Whitney Houston routine.

03:30.581 --> 03:33.927
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
Listen, Jess.

03:34.124 --> 03:36.151
I think we should
hunt together.

03:36.294 --> 03:39.232
Like, together-together.

03:39.297 --> 03:40.776
Oh, my God.

03:41.016 --> 03:44.652
Really? Okay.
All right.

03:44.791 --> 03:48.183
So, we should double back and go on
the offensive, right?

03:48.248 --> 03:49.666
Put this stick to use.

03:49.755 --> 03:51.693
Yeah, that is
a great idea.

03:51.758 --> 03:54.972
I really like that idea,
but I was thinking

03:55.091 --> 03:59.820
we use your stick
to walk, right?

03:59.885 --> 04:02.550
And then maybe we turn
that walk into a run,

04:02.615 --> 04:05.815
and then we run
directly into a hiding spot.

04:05.880 --> 04:08.654
And if anyone finds us,
you can protect us with your...

04:08.793 --> 04:10.689
stick stuff.

04:12.373 --> 04:14.392
What do you say...

04:16.406 --> 04:17.516
babe?

04:17.872 --> 04:20.865
Okay.
Let's hide.

04:21.646 --> 04:22.784
Okay.

04:25.470 --> 04:26.809
Oh.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.912
The hell?

04:39.031 --> 04:41.849
Pretty trippy,
huh, Todd?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.319
Rob Corddry?

04:46.220 --> 04:48.815
Second lead
on HBO's "Ballers"?

04:48.880 --> 04:50.682
I'm gonna have
to stop you right there.

04:50.747 --> 04:53.128
Uh, I'm not
"the second lead".

04:53.193 --> 04:55.753
It's a two-hander.
It's me and The Rock.

04:55.818 --> 04:57.638
Wait.
What's going on?

04:57.703 --> 04:59.247
Where's Jess?

04:59.431 --> 05:01.160
I was just about
to thump on Pack, and...

05:01.225 --> 05:04.728
And now you're there.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.183
Am I dead?

05:08.275 --> 05:10.502
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.158
Not yet.
This all around you?

05:13.223 --> 05:16.527
This... This thing,
most of those...

05:16.592 --> 05:19.291
This is the realm
of your unconscious.

05:19.413 --> 05:22.238
Lucky for you, you got me
to guide you through it.

05:23.063 --> 05:28.906
You're telling me Rob Corddry
is my spirit guide? Ow.

05:28.971 --> 05:32.660
Oh, hell, yeah, my dude!

05:32.725 --> 05:34.527
Whoo!
We're gonna get naughty.

05:34.592 --> 05:37.066
- What!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:37.131 --> 05:40.944
If you're here,
that means... No.

05:41.265 --> 05:43.688
No! Oh, yeah.

05:43.753 --> 05:45.404
I smell
what we're cooking.

05:45.469 --> 05:48.467
Where is he, huh?
Where is The Rock?

05:48.532 --> 05:50.051
No.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.011
Where are you, D,
you big boy?

05:52.076 --> 05:54.569
Actually,
he's not here, okay?

05:54.634 --> 05:56.486
It's just me, no Rock.

05:58.131 --> 05:59.174
Uh.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.610
D.J.'s shooting, like, nine
movies right now, okay?

06:01.675 --> 06:04.899
I think he's a little busy for
some random dude's dream sequence.

06:04.964 --> 06:08.110
Me, on the other hand,
huh?

06:08.366 --> 06:11.104
Come on,
hit that shit, man!

06:11.328 --> 06:12.808
- Boom! Ballers.
- Ballers.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.677
Nice. So, this is
what's gonna happen.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.930
We are gonna
step through that door,

06:17.995 --> 06:23.340
and <i> you</i> are gonna learn
a lesson about you.

06:23.452 --> 06:25.052
And if I don't,
then what?

06:25.335 --> 06:27.607
That guy shits his pants
or something?

06:27.672 --> 06:30.315
Yeah, he'll shit his pants
again... probably.

06:30.380 --> 06:33.589
But if you don't learn
why you're here,

06:33.654 --> 06:40.222
this Todd, the real Todd,
will never wake up again.

06:40.335 --> 06:42.637
Oh, ***
I know, right?

06:42.702 --> 06:44.523
Shall we?

06:45.260 --> 06:47.852
Hey, so "Hot Tub Time Machine,"
that wasn't real, right?

06:47.931 --> 06:49.444
Are you asking me
if the hot tub

06:49.509 --> 06:51.919
- was a real time machine?
- Just answer the question.

06:51.984 --> 06:54.049
You don't have to be a dick
about it. Was it real?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.712
Okay, well, what if we hide
down there in that ditch?

06:56.777 --> 06:58.217
Okay.

06:58.308 --> 07:00.352
Are you trying to drown
in flood water?

07:00.417 --> 07:02.119
No, no, no. Jess...

07:02.186 --> 07:06.765
hiding is all about
anticipating danger.

07:06.891 --> 07:09.304
And the way we...

07:09.463 --> 07:12.201
- Is that a cave?
- No.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.293
It's the perfect
hiding spot.

07:15.874 --> 07:20.173
Well, let's just say
my hidey senses are a-tingling.

07:20.465 --> 07:22.367
Something tells me we're gonna
be totally fine.

07:22.432 --> 07:26.064
Stop right there.

07:27.238 --> 07:30.117
Oh, God, please.
I don't want to die, please.

07:30.182 --> 07:31.725
Little buddy?

07:33.019 --> 07:34.699
- Big Bruce!
- Hot damn!

07:34.764 --> 07:36.483
I thought that was you!

07:36.548 --> 07:39.349
- I can't believe y'all are still alive.
- It's so good to see you.

07:39.414 --> 07:41.445
Hey, Chet, get on out here!
See who's here!

07:41.515 --> 07:45.255
- Hey!
- Right on. It's Pack and Jess.

07:46.027 --> 07:48.481
- Do I know them?
- Ye-Yeah.

07:48.546 --> 07:49.596
They're from
the plane crash.

07:49.661 --> 07:51.940
It's... It's Bruce
and Chet.

07:52.006 --> 07:54.385
- Uh, these guys.
- Yeah.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.473
Oh, come on, Jess.
You remember me. Bruce.

07:56.555 --> 07:58.850
- Bruuuuce.
- Unforch, she doesn't.

07:58.915 --> 08:00.208
She got a little bit
of a head trauma.

08:00.273 --> 08:03.186
Thinks she's 18.
Whoa. Hi, I'm Chet.

08:03.269 --> 08:06.533
You should know that we banged
and both jizzed, so...

08:06.598 --> 08:09.360
- Sorry about your noggin.
- Thanks.

08:09.474 --> 08:11.132
So, Bruce, what's the deal?
Is this your cave?

08:11.197 --> 08:13.293
Hell, yeah, it is.
Come on in!

08:14.725 --> 08:17.351
Oh, wow!
It's so small.

08:31.014 --> 08:33.375
- A moment, sir?
- What? Not now, Martha.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.311
Steve and that ragged old cow
are going toe-to-toe.

08:36.376 --> 08:39.130
Half-Pint and The Hot One
have disappeared.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.553
- What do you mean?
- I've lost them on the feed.

08:41.618 --> 08:44.284
Well, do your bloody job
and find them.

08:47.097 --> 08:49.435
Oh, whoa.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.357
That is a freakin' wild ride.
Right?

08:52.422 --> 08:53.664
Ah.

08:53.971 --> 08:55.197
Where the hell are we?

08:55.262 --> 08:57.199
You're about to find out.

08:57.264 --> 09:01.416
Now, watch and learn.

09:03.046 --> 09:04.665
Greg Graff?

09:04.730 --> 09:07.446
Oh, my God.
This friggin' punk bully.

09:07.511 --> 09:09.454
He made my life hell
in middle school.

09:09.519 --> 09:11.149
Yeah, but what you
didn't know was that Greg

09:11.214 --> 09:12.331
was going through
his own hell.

09:12.396 --> 09:14.691
Oh, you moron!
You sunk all our money

09:14.756 --> 09:16.534
into a self-cleaning
toilet business?

09:16.599 --> 09:18.353
Yeah, Wanda, I did because

09:18.418 --> 09:19.793
it's a good investment!

09:19.858 --> 09:21.956
People are always gonna
have to take a shit.

09:22.021 --> 09:25.950
So, probably see Greg a little
differently now, huh?

09:27.941 --> 09:30.618
Hey.
Go to him.

09:35.335 --> 09:36.899
Hey.

09:37.383 --> 09:39.591
Come on, man.

09:41.233 --> 09:42.777
- Boom!
- Oh! What?!

09:42.842 --> 09:45.494
Oh! I'm a little
bigger now, huh, Greg?!

09:45.559 --> 09:46.814
Todd! What the hell! Yeah.

09:46.879 --> 09:48.983
You just met my good friend,
Derek Punchly!

09:49.048 --> 09:50.398
- Whoo.
- Jesus, man. No.

09:50.463 --> 09:52.454
You were supposed to see that
he only lashed out at you

09:52.519 --> 09:54.544
because of what he was
going through at home.

09:54.609 --> 09:56.960
Who gives a shit, man?
My mom was a hard ass.

09:57.025 --> 09:58.260
Didn't turn me
into a bully.

09:58.325 --> 10:00.080
You just punched a child.

10:00.145 --> 10:02.464
- Is that all you got, pussy?
- What'd you say?

10:02.529 --> 10:03.778
Whoa! Wow!

10:03.843 --> 10:06.044
All right, dude.
Let's go, man! Come on!

10:06.109 --> 10:07.669
Yeah, you better thank
Rob Corddry,

10:07.734 --> 10:10.641
'cause he just saved
your life, bitch!

10:10.980 --> 10:13.408
And by that time,
the life raft

10:13.473 --> 10:15.796
was nothing
but a pile of driftwood.

10:16.396 --> 10:18.491
And that's when
the birds came...

10:18.763 --> 10:21.283
About a dozen of 'em,
circling.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.385
Plucked Beth
right out of the water

10:24.450 --> 10:26.166
and into the sky.

10:26.826 --> 10:30.057
I ain't never seen birds work
together like that before.

10:30.950 --> 10:34.166
And thankfully, we washed up
on shore that night.

10:35.845 --> 10:39.100
What about you, Chet?
What happened after the gorilla?

10:39.390 --> 10:41.030
You mean...

10:41.134 --> 10:43.810
after you
abandoned me to die?

10:45.703 --> 10:48.443
Nada mucho, actually.
Just dipped about for a while.

10:48.508 --> 10:50.842
Ate some funny berries,
shot out a runny shit.

10:50.907 --> 10:52.776
Literally walked
right into Bruce.

10:54.319 --> 10:56.213
Hey, what about y'all?
Where y'all been?

10:58.296 --> 11:00.556
Listen, I don't know
how to say this.

11:00.621 --> 11:02.166
It's just us now.

11:02.388 --> 11:04.969
The gorilla...
It killed the others.

11:05.034 --> 11:06.104
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa.

11:06.169 --> 11:07.825
Yeah, it tore them all
to pieces

11:07.890 --> 11:09.858
with its big
monkey hands.

11:09.988 --> 11:11.365
Jesus.

11:11.732 --> 11:14.819
Apes and birds, man.
Apes and birds.

11:14.884 --> 11:16.550
Pack, can I... can I speak
to you for a second?

11:16.615 --> 11:18.658
- Just...
- Of course.

11:20.130 --> 11:21.661
Excuse her.

11:21.945 --> 11:23.347
She's numb from grief.

11:23.412 --> 11:25.440
What are you doing?
We have to tell them the truth.

11:25.505 --> 11:27.682
If they know about the hunt,
they could think the others

11:27.747 --> 11:29.436
are gonna follow us here
and kill <i> them.</i>

11:29.501 --> 11:30.851
They'll kick us out
of the cave.

11:30.916 --> 11:33.753
My sorority big always says,
"Honesty is the best policy.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.067
Now tell us
why you're fat."

11:35.132 --> 11:38.212
We have to come clean.
This is our only shot.

11:38.401 --> 11:40.539
Declan clearly doesn't know
this place exists.

11:40.604 --> 11:42.540
Well, maybe they
can help us defeat Declan.

11:42.605 --> 11:44.809
I mean, they don't have bracelets.
We can save everyone.

11:44.874 --> 11:47.127
Save everyone?

11:47.192 --> 11:48.861
Are you listening
to yourself?

11:48.926 --> 11:50.822
You're being so selfish.

11:50.887 --> 11:53.066
I'm trying to protect <i> us.</i>

11:53.131 --> 11:56.088
You're doing this...
for us?

11:56.153 --> 12:00.547
Of course. So just...
don't rock the boat.

12:02.980 --> 12:05.653
What do you say we take one
of these magic doors back in time

12:05.718 --> 12:10.058
to, like, the first Hooters or something,
you know? When silicone was good.

12:10.123 --> 12:11.368
Hey!

12:11.645 --> 12:15.246
My glasses. Found 'em.

12:15.311 --> 12:18.280
Oh, my God.
That's 8-year-old me!

12:18.398 --> 12:19.778
'Sup, playboy?

12:19.843 --> 12:23.737
Whoo, he is a handsome
little sucker, huh?

12:23.802 --> 12:26.230
You said your mom
was a real hardass, right?

12:26.339 --> 12:27.763
You remember this day?

12:27.851 --> 12:29.977
Come on, Todd.
We're leaving.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.823
But you promised
me a lollipop.

12:31.888 --> 12:34.016
Shut up,
you little crybaby.

12:34.081 --> 12:35.760
Ow.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.245
See?
She's mean as hell.

12:39.310 --> 12:42.392
Yeah, but do you ever why
she was so mean to you?

12:42.457 --> 12:43.998
And sna...

12:44.346 --> 12:46.276
Please, this loan,

12:46.341 --> 12:49.653
I-it's the only way I can get
Todd into the good schools.

12:49.763 --> 12:52.278
Y-You know how rough
Scottsdale Public is.

12:52.343 --> 12:54.036
He... He'll never survive.

12:54.101 --> 12:55.795
I'm sorry.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.106
Your credit is dog shit.

13:06.914 --> 13:08.494
Come on, Todd, we're leaving.

13:08.559 --> 13:11.884
Your mother taught you to mask
feelings of hurt and sadness

13:11.949 --> 13:15.308
with displays of aggression.
Classic cycle.

13:15.466 --> 13:17.292
Do you understand
that now?

13:18.208 --> 13:20.819
Yeah, I understand...

13:21.318 --> 13:24.110
that this butt sniffer should've
given my mom a loan.

13:24.197 --> 13:25.243
Boom!
Oh, my God!

13:25.308 --> 13:26.778
- Eat it, moneybags!
- No!

13:26.843 --> 13:29.655
- And I ruled Scottsdale Public.
- What are you do...

13:29.720 --> 13:31.740
H-How are you not getting this?
Are you thick?

13:31.805 --> 13:34.142
Hey, watch it, Cords.
It's still my head.

13:34.207 --> 13:36.032
- I'll think your dick off.
- What?

13:38.922 --> 13:41.674
Boy, I haven't heard that sound
for a time.

13:41.992 --> 13:43.435
What?

13:43.662 --> 13:45.483
Laughter.

13:46.529 --> 13:48.452
What with this group's
been through,

13:48.517 --> 13:51.088
I didn't think any of us
were ever gonna laugh again.

13:51.268 --> 13:53.020
Heck, what am I
telling you for?

13:53.085 --> 13:55.680
You had to watch an ape tear
apart all your friends.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.104
Yeah.

13:57.340 --> 13:58.850
Even so,

13:59.108 --> 14:01.293
I can't help but think that
we've turned a corner.

14:01.358 --> 14:03.781
Maybe we can actually find
peace on this island,

14:03.846 --> 14:06.748
love one another,
live in harmony,

14:06.898 --> 14:10.617
actually be 100% safe,
you know?

14:12.756 --> 14:14.497
Aw, heck.
Listen to me babble on.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.865
Pay me no mind, Jess.
I'm just an old fool.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.278
Listen, Bruce.

14:20.476 --> 14:22.287
I have
to tell you something.

14:22.352 --> 14:23.606
Hey, Bruce.

14:23.671 --> 14:27.000
Listen, man,
I hate to be <i> that guy,</i>

14:27.105 --> 14:29.436
but the sleeping spot
you gave us is...

14:29.501 --> 14:32.841
sort of craggy,
so I was wondering if...

14:34.761 --> 14:36.582
What's happening?

14:37.590 --> 14:39.713
Hey! Dude.

14:39.849 --> 14:42.144
You're being very un-Baller
right now.

14:42.209 --> 14:45.263
I'm just trying to help
you wake up, man. Really?

14:45.328 --> 14:48.069
But if all you wanna do
is fight, go ahead.

14:48.281 --> 14:50.056
Knock yourself out.

14:52.129 --> 14:53.757
What?

14:53.822 --> 14:55.699
Hell, yeah!

14:55.865 --> 14:58.021
This guy
is swole patrol.

14:58.086 --> 15:00.338
What's up,
Cobra Kai Todd?

15:00.403 --> 15:03.070
Hell, yeah.
What's up, little bitch?

15:03.629 --> 15:05.075
What did you say
to me, dude?

15:05.140 --> 15:06.618
And Declan and his friends

15:06.683 --> 15:08.303
are just watching
from the mansion,

15:08.368 --> 15:09.544
like it's a sport.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.040
So, you're saying there can only
be one survivor?

15:12.105 --> 15:13.591
Yeah.

15:13.683 --> 15:15.887
Well, then, I guess we don't
have much of a choice, do we?

15:15.952 --> 15:18.313
Well, hold on...
Hold on a second, Chester, now.

15:18.378 --> 15:19.905
They don't even know
we're here.

15:19.970 --> 15:21.613
As long as they don't
spot us, we're safe.

15:23.050 --> 15:26.008
Oh!

15:26.102 --> 15:27.527
Oh, shit.

15:27.725 --> 15:29.599
Oh, shit.

15:29.807 --> 15:31.401
They know we're here.

15:31.466 --> 15:33.278
ChWell...

15:33.770 --> 15:35.974
then I guess it's begun!

15:36.039 --> 15:37.765
Damn, son a bitch! Where'd
you get another knife?!

15:37.830 --> 15:41.269
Old Chester always has a second
switchblade, ass balls!

15:41.334 --> 15:42.847
Don't you get it?!

15:42.912 --> 15:45.183
There can only be
one survivor!

15:45.248 --> 15:46.473
Okay.
Hang on a second!

15:46.538 --> 15:47.809
Oh, God!

15:53.212 --> 15:56.601
<font color="#ffff00">Sync corrections</font>  by  <font color=#00FF00>srjanapala</font>

15:57.479 --> 15:59.971
- I told you not to tell them.
- Chet, stop!

16:00.036 --> 16:01.874
Sooner or later,
this Derclan guy

16:01.939 --> 16:03.409
is gonna pull us
<i>all</i> into this.

16:03.474 --> 16:05.412
It's "Lawrence of the Flies,"
babies,

16:05.509 --> 16:09.123
and I aim to be Lawrence. You think
it's "Lawrence of the Flies"?

16:09.188 --> 16:11.133
Everybody, rush him!

16:13.534 --> 16:15.567
Let the games begin!

16:19.067 --> 16:22.860
You. You led
that metal bird straight to us.

16:22.925 --> 16:25.599
You brought death
to our door step.

16:25.976 --> 16:29.381
Get him! Quick, Jess!
Use your stick to protect us!

16:29.446 --> 16:31.251
What? You're the dude.
You're supposed to protect <i> me.</i>

16:32.903 --> 16:34.905
God damn it!

16:37.943 --> 16:39.589
Start something,
you little bitch.

16:39.654 --> 16:41.561
I'm right here, bitch.
Start something.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.888
- You go ahead, bro. Start something.
- No, you start something.

16:43.953 --> 16:45.680
- I'm right here, dude.
- Oh, for the love of Christ,

16:45.745 --> 16:48.526
one of you start something.
You're running out of time.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.631
- Copy that, Cords.
- Copy that, Cords.

16:51.085 --> 16:53.969
Ha!
Two Todds enter.

16:54.034 --> 16:55.385
Aah!

16:55.450 --> 16:56.853
Ha!

16:58.271 --> 17:00.500
One Todd leaves!

17:04.910 --> 17:07.753
Aah! Ha-ah!

17:10.492 --> 17:13.173
And good night.

17:13.238 --> 17:14.896
Whoo!

17:14.989 --> 17:16.740
- Good.
- Oh, boy.

17:16.805 --> 17:19.519
Never doubt the twins.
You see that, Corddry?

17:19.584 --> 17:22.428
Oh, you think
you kicked <i> his</i> ass?

17:22.492 --> 17:23.871
Uhh, yeah.

17:23.939 --> 17:25.558
He didn't land
a single punch.

17:25.623 --> 17:29.392
Then maybe you should take
a look at this.

17:29.469 --> 17:31.209
Whoa.

17:32.282 --> 17:34.033
I guess he did get
some shots in, huh?

17:34.098 --> 17:35.984
What? No!

17:36.076 --> 17:37.492
Jesus Christ.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.017
Do I have to spell
this out for you?

17:39.082 --> 17:44.664
You. Did. This. To...

17:45.953 --> 17:47.107
you.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.553
I... kicked my own ass?

17:50.618 --> 17:52.055
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.328
That means... whenever
I choose aggression,

17:55.393 --> 17:58.102
I'm only hurting...

17:58.656 --> 18:01.397
- myself.
- Oh!

18:01.462 --> 18:04.440
Wow. Yes!

18:04.505 --> 18:06.465
Mwah! Yes, finally.

18:06.530 --> 18:08.184
Oh, God.

18:08.287 --> 18:09.609
To think it only took you
three tries

18:09.674 --> 18:12.305
and a super-on-the-nose
metaphor to get you there.

18:12.370 --> 18:14.030
I know what I need
to do now.

18:14.095 --> 18:16.072
Well, I'll be
seeing you, Todd.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.011
Thanks, "Ballers'"
Rob Corddry.

18:18.076 --> 18:19.616
Mm-hmm.

18:20.368 --> 18:21.922
Hey.

18:22.430 --> 18:25.626
You want to know why my brain
chose you, Cords?

18:26.028 --> 18:28.141
'Cause The Rock may be
the pecs and the abs

18:28.206 --> 18:30.691
and the ass
of that show...

18:30.899 --> 18:32.692
but you're the heart.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.036
Thank you, Todd.

18:35.642 --> 18:37.563
But next time, you know,
tell The Rock...

18:37.628 --> 18:39.098
Get the ***
outta here.

18:39.163 --> 18:41.265
You got it, boss.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.320
Now, Jess, I don't
feel good whomping on a girl.

18:54.385 --> 18:56.013
When those birds
snatched Beth,

18:56.078 --> 18:59.829

to protect them.
