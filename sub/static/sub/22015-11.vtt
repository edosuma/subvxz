WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:02.236
.

00:02.270 --> 00:03.104
- In the
criminal justice system,

00:05.139 --> 00:07.108
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.509
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.542 --> 00:10.278
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.311 --> 00:12.080
are members of an elite squad

00:12.113 --> 00:14.048
known as the
Special Victims Unit.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.549
These are their stories.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.419
- This is what three weeks off

00:18.452 --> 00:20.654
with a five-year-old
looks like.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.558
- Yeah, Lucy took him in.

00:24.592 --> 00:28.496
I'm just ready to head
into the office myself.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.398
- You could take
a few more weeks, you know.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.266
- Thank you,
but I think if Noah and I

00:32.300 --> 00:34.135
spent one more day together,

00:34.168 --> 00:36.504
we'd both end up in
straightjackets.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.372
How's the little guy doing?

00:38.406 --> 00:40.174
- He's great.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.810
He's stayed up past 10:00
every night this week.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.513
And last night,
I let him finish

00:45.546 --> 00:51.419
an entire ice cream sundae,
while watching cartoons,

00:51.452 --> 00:54.688
in my bed.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.092
- Well...

00:58.126 --> 01:01.662
As long as I don't
close my eyes, I'm good.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.501
- After the military, Mike
decides he wants to tend bar

01:07.535 --> 01:10.371
at this dive, Lucky's.
- Yeah, in Hell's Kitchen.

01:10.404 --> 01:15.243
- Before it was chic.
After he died...

01:15.276 --> 01:19.513
Every night for six months,
I'd go into Lucky's.

01:19.547 --> 01:23.284
And order
one too many vodka sodas.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.587
I could tell you not to
beat yourself up over Sheila.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.291
But if there's one thing
I hate, it's a hypocrite.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.229
- Thanks, chief.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.898
- Good morning
from the flight deck.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.534
This is your captain speaking.

01:40.568 --> 01:45.306
Welcome to Flight 42,
New York to Atlanta.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.541
Sit back and enjoy the view.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.625
Just a little
speed bump there, folks.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.495
We're expecting a smooth ride
from here on out.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.498
A bunch of liberals
just found God.

02:10.531 --> 02:15.269
Tailwind puts us
into Atlanta early.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.638
Got us staying
at the Continental.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.540
Five-star hotel.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.709
- Great.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.511
- Holly's talking about
getting together for drinks

02:23.544 --> 02:25.646
when we land; you should come.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.882
- Uh, I head back
to New York after this.

02:28.916 --> 02:32.953
- Too bad.
Auto pilot is engaged.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.923
I'm going to hit the loo.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.196
Watch out for mountain tops.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.167
You look good.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.684
- Oh!
- Excuse me.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.486
Is everything okay?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.455
- Probably just avoiding
some bad air.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.357
Sir.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.891
It's okay.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.693
Seatbelts, everyone, now.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.837
- Whoa!

03:27.608 --> 03:30.244
- First officer Sidnana,
Captain Carter.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.348
Tara, what the hell
are you doing?

03:34.382 --> 03:36.817
- I'm not letting you in.

03:40.354 --> 03:43.291
- She hit the toggle switch.
We're locked out.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.734
Tara.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.670
- We need to get in there.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.972
- Oh, my God,
she's going to kill us.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.875
- I saw her, she's Arab.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.448
- John, we have an issue.

04:09.683 --> 04:13.554
- Flight 42, we show you've
deviated from your flight plan.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.723
Flight 42?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.525
Call the FAA.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.762
- Again.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.072
Again!

04:36.977 --> 04:38.446
I have control.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.714
- Don't touch me,
don't touch me.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.383
Let go of me!

04:42.416 --> 04:47.555
Don't touch me!
No!

04:47.588 --> 04:52.860
Let me go!
Don't touch me!

04:52.893 --> 04:54.395
No!

05:01.769 --> 05:03.904
- Thank God for
flight insurance.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.507
- Come on, Fin, don't tell me
you cancelled your trip.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.676
- Look, if I have a choice
between fishing and living.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.478
- You know, it was bad enough
we had to worry about

05:10.511 --> 05:12.646
passengers, now co
I'm with Fin.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.815
- Plus this terrorist stuff
happens in threes,

05:14.848 --> 05:17.385
so until the next two pop off,
call me homeboy.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.786
I'm staying home.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.454
- We don't even know
that she is a terrorist.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.423
- Well, the news outlets
are reporting

05:22.456 --> 05:23.891
she's been to Bangalore
twice in the last two months.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.826
- Well, I read
she was born there, so.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.561
- So you must have also read

05:27.595 --> 05:29.930
that there's over 40 Salafi
mosques in Bangalore.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.066
Where Muslim Indians are known
to have become radicalized.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.768
- Where'd you
get that, Fox News?

05:34.802 --> 05:37.371
- Huffington Post.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.408
- Welcome back, Liv.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.775
- Good.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.348
- Rollins.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.486
- Lieutenant.
- I'm really fine, Amanda.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.656
- Uh...

05:55.689 --> 05:58.091
- So Sandy Sullivan
is on the phone.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.561
She's a union rep
from Optimum Air.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.995
- The airline that
almost just crashed?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.063
- Yeah.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.565
According to Sullivan,

06:04.598 --> 06:07.935
the co-pilot
is saying she was raped.

06:07.968 --> 06:12.606
*

06:12.640 --> 06:14.708
- Lieutenant Benson.

07:02.890 --> 07:03.857
- I always thought airport
jails were an urban myth.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.027
- Yeah, you wouldn't believe
how much use they get.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.796
I'm sorry you had
to schlep all the way out here.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.998
Waste of time.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.067
- Eh, terrorists today,
you know they read handbooks

07:14.101 --> 07:15.869
on what to do
if their captured.

07:15.903 --> 07:20.140
My guess, the latest edition
added "cry rape."

07:23.544 --> 07:24.912
- You must be
Lieutenant Benson.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.514
- I am.
- I'm Sandy Sullivan.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.081
Tara's union rep.
- Okay, well you did

07:28.115 --> 07:30.117
the right thing by calling us.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.720
Has Tara been tested
for drugs and alcohol?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.522
- Her tests came back negative.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.690
- Any history
with mental illness?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.559
- None.
But pilots and co-pilots

07:38.592 --> 07:40.227
tend not to report
that sort of thing.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.995
- We have agents
at her apartment right now.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.797
We've dumped
her phone, computer.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.099
Performed a deep search of all
her social media accounts.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.201
So far, there's
no links to terrorism.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.738
Either she's the best
sleeper agent there is--

07:50.771 --> 07:53.006
- Or, she's telling the truth.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.944
- They're calling me
a terrorist.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.879
- You did lock the pilot
out of the cockpit

07:58.912 --> 08:00.080
and take over the plane.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.716
- Not to crash it.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.218
I just needed
to land back at JFK,

08:05.252 --> 08:08.989
and get the hell
out of that plane.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.925
That agent,
he wouldn't tell me.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.094
- The passengers.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.029
Is everyone okay?
Did anyone get hurt?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.831
I'll never forgive myself if--

08:17.865 --> 08:20.100
- So far, everyone's fine.
- Tara.

08:20.133 --> 08:25.138
You told your union rep
that you had been raped.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.240
So can you
tell us about that?

08:27.274 --> 08:30.544
- Six months ago, we were on
our way over from Hong Kong.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.746
The crew was put up
at the Hyland Suites.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.248
It was Erin Kay's birthday;
she's a flight attendant.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.153
We were at the bar celebrating,
and I had too much to drink.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.322
- Okay, did you tell
a friend or family member?

08:42.355 --> 08:45.759
- I called in sick to work.
I drove to my sister's.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.995
She lives in Sunnyside, and...

08:48.028 --> 08:51.565
I know, I should
have filed for a police report.

08:51.599 --> 08:52.866
Or done a rape kit.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.235
- No, you're--
- They promised me.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.305
- Optimum Air.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.009
- Optimum Air knew
that you were raped?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.011
- They said if
I kept my mouth shut,

09:04.044 --> 09:05.646
they'd fast track me
to my wings,

09:05.679 --> 09:08.882
and I'd never have
to fly with him again.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.884
For six months, I didn't.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.087
Until this morning, when they
put me back on that plane.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.591
- You, your rapist
was on the plane?

09:19.993 --> 09:22.763
- Captain Carter.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.766
The pilot.
The hero.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.736
What a joke.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.705
*

09:31.739 --> 09:34.341
- Excuse me, we need to speak
with Logan Carter.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.243
- Well, Captain Carter
was cleared two hours ago.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.045
- Optimum Air put him on

09:38.078 --> 09:40.080
a flight home for some
much needed R and R.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.950
- Los Angeles.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.919
- Captain Carter's been with

09:45.953 --> 09:47.621
Optimum Air
for the last 15 years.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.289
- He's the chief airman.
He's in charge of training

09:49.322 --> 09:51.191
the pilots, making sure
that they fly to code.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.627
If they don't, he sends
them back for more training.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.730
- Flight 42 wasn't Carter's
first heroic move.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.800
He's the real deal.
He flew during Shock and Awe.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.069
- Okay, so what about
sexual harassment?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.937
Are there any complaints
against Carter?

10:03.971 --> 10:07.808
- None, guy didn't have so much
as a parking ticket.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.810
- Does any of Tara's story
check out?

10:09.843 --> 10:12.345
- Yeah, Hyland Suites confirms
that the flight crew

10:12.379 --> 10:14.081
stayed at their hotel
on July 10th.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.348
That's the night
Tara claims she was raped.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.317
- Right, and her
credit card receipts

10:17.350 --> 10:19.252
do show that she rented
a car in Midtown on the 11th.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.255
She drove to Sunnyside,
where her sister Alexis lives.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.424
- She's been with Optimum Air
for five years.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.694
Never missed a day of work
until the rape,

10:26.727 --> 10:28.762
after which she
was out for a week.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.063
- Before that,
she and Captain Carter

10:30.097 --> 10:31.431
flew together all the time.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.167
After, they never flew
together again.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.670
- Sounds like somebody
who's suffered a trauma.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.439
Fin, Carisi, you talk to
the rest of the flight crew.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.341
- Rollins, go to Sunnyside,
talk to the sister,

10:41.374 --> 10:44.411
and I'll talk to Optimum Air.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.315
- I started this airline
with three planes;

10:48.348 --> 10:51.251
now we fly in 35 states,
all over Europe.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.688
- It's an interesting
marketing strategy...

10:54.722 --> 10:56.123
if this was the '60s.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.725
- We aim to put
the fun back in flying.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.327
- By objectifying
your female employees?

11:00.360 --> 11:03.130
- I have two young daughters.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.865
And just last year,
I let my assistant, Ellen,

11:04.898 --> 11:08.001
have the day off so she could
attend the women's march.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.469
- It was exhilarating.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.739
- I let her wear that funny hat
for a week.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.007
- Next you're going to tell me
that you voted for Hillary.

11:14.041 --> 11:18.311
- My heart bleeds pink,
but I have a business to run.

11:18.345 --> 11:22.449
And let's be honest, sex sells.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.754
Is that part of your
business model as well?

11:26.787 --> 11:31.424
- No, God, no,
this whole thing is ridiculous.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.427
Logan Carter is a gentleman.
He has a beautiful wife,

11:34.461 --> 11:36.163
a beautiful little girl.
If he wasn't on that plane,

11:36.196 --> 11:37.965
who knows
what would have happened?

11:37.998 --> 11:40.300
- Do you really think Tara
would have crashed that plane?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.269
- I'm glad we didn't
have to find out.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.772
Look, we vetted Tara
before we hired her.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.775
If we didn't hire her,
I'd have the EEOC on my back.

11:47.808 --> 11:51.344
- So hiring female pilots,
that's just to what?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.313
Fulfill some kind of quota?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.048
- Only four percent
of the pilots

11:55.082 --> 11:56.750
who are currently flying
are women.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.119
Not everyone has the stamina
for the long hours,

11:59.152 --> 12:01.221
the constant changes
in sleep schedule,

12:01.254 --> 12:03.290
nights and weekends
away from their families.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.794
Forget starting one.
The job requires extreme focus.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.196
- And you don't think
women can focus.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.265
- They're not flocking
to careers in aviation.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.334
You don't believe me?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.403
When's the last time that
you boarded a plane,

12:16.436 --> 12:18.906
and when the pilot came
over the loudspeaker,

12:18.939 --> 12:20.774
you heard a woman's voice?

12:23.210 --> 12:26.213
- Has Tara ever said anything
or done anything

12:26.246 --> 12:29.482
to make you believe that she
was a radical Muslim?

12:29.516 --> 12:33.954
- No, but what other
explanation is there?

12:33.987 --> 12:35.856
- Oh, I can think of a few.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.826
- Kevin is our head of HR.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.427
Give Detective Benson
anything she needs.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.797
- It's Lieutenant.
- Sorry.

12:43.831 --> 12:47.100
- Tara never filed a grievance
against Logan Carter.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.502
If anything, she requested
to fly with him.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.372
Everyone does.
Logan has the best hours.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.507
He never works
a weekend or a holiday.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.977
- Well, then why,
after July 11th,

12:57.010 --> 13:00.180
did she stop flying with him?
- During preflight checks,

13:00.213 --> 13:02.349
Tara forgot to
remove the pitot covers,

13:02.382 --> 13:04.317
turn on the anti-ice switch.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.820
Logan sent her back
for more training.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.522
Once Tara completed
the required courses,

13:09.556 --> 13:11.458
Logan gave her another chance.
- Well, if he gave her

13:11.491 --> 13:13.293
another chance--
- The crew complained.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.996
After that,
Tara had an attitude.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.398
And then
there was the drinking.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.535
- She likes to burn
the candle at both ends.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.538
On July 10th, the crew
had drinks at the bar.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.142
The rule is, eight hours
from bottle to throttle.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.477
Tara pushed it.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.847
The next morning,
she calls in sick.

13:33.881 --> 13:37.550
Delaying the plane.
The crew was pissed.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.452
They had seniority,
we moved her.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.588
- Okay, so I'm going to need
the names and the numbers

13:41.621 --> 13:45.058
of every single
crew member that complained.

13:45.092 --> 13:49.396
- Terrorist or not, I'm not
surprised Tara lost it mid-air.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.298
- Because she seemed to be

13:51.331 --> 13:53.133
spiraling for months.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.501
- If you felt that way,

13:54.534 --> 13:56.469
why would you ever
put her on a plane?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.139
- I recommended
that she be grounded.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.441
Take time off.
But the company felt

14:01.474 --> 14:04.311
it would be bad for business
if it turned out

14:04.344 --> 14:07.380
we benched our only
female co-pilot.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.449
*

14:18.358 --> 14:18.892
.

14:18.926 --> 14:19.759
- It was my last day
of vacay, thank God

14:21.194 --> 14:22.462
I wasn't on that flight.
What was it,

14:22.495 --> 14:24.097
like some kind of breakdown?

14:24.131 --> 14:25.966
- That's what we're
trying to figure out.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.434
Now, on July 10th,
you were at the Hyland Suites

14:27.467 --> 14:29.036
with Logan Carter and Tara?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.404
- I turned 30.
God, do I feel old.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.906
- It only gets better.

14:32.940 --> 14:33.907
So what was the mood
like that night?

14:33.941 --> 14:35.375
Did everybody get along?

14:35.408 --> 14:37.344
- Yeah, I mean, I had
one too many Negronis.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.611
I had to turn in early.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.947
- What about Tara
and the captain,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.381
did they turn in early too?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.683
- Uh, she was ordering drinks
when I left.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.319
- Did you ever have a problem
with Captain Carter?

14:46.353 --> 14:49.522
- Okay, Logan can be
a little rigid.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.291
- Tara messed up
the pre-flight check.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.060
- It was more
than just the checklist.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.594
Tara took a photo of the sunset

14:54.627 --> 14:56.263
as we were landing
into Abu Dhabi.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.231
Cell phones are
a huge no-no in the cockpit,

14:58.265 --> 14:59.566
but we all do it.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.568
I heard Tara
posted hers on Instagram,

15:01.601 --> 15:03.436
hashtagged it "Optimum Air."

15:03.470 --> 15:05.338
You know, Captain Carter had
no choice but to write her up.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.307
- Well, Tara's telling
a different story.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.010
She's saying
Captain Carter raped her.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.578
- I don't know
anything about that.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.246
- So he never
crossed the line with you?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.448
- Aren't you
looking at this backwards?

15:15.482 --> 15:18.952
I mean, the crew
on Flight 42, Sabrina, Molly.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.188
They're some
of my best friends.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.690
If it weren't for Logan,
I'd be planning their memorials

15:23.723 --> 15:25.993
with their families.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.034
I've tried calling--

15:34.067 --> 15:36.236
- She's hanging in there.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.472
- The Feds interviewed me
for four hours.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.141
This is all crazy.

15:41.174 --> 15:44.011
The trips to Bangalore,
I was with her.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.179
We went for our grandmother's
99th birthday.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.615
She died three weeks later,
we went back for her funeral.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.117
Why isn't anyone
reporting that?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.319
- Because terrorists
make better news.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.387
Okay?
Listen.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.390
Tara told us that she
visited you sometime in July.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.759
- She showed up
at my doorstep, unannounced.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.228
She said she
had some vacation days.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.065
- My sister's idea of a day off

16:05.098 --> 16:07.400
is flying standby
from New York to Paris.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.537
Not to see the Eiffel Tower,
just to be on a plane.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.139
- So when she showed up...

16:12.172 --> 16:14.207
- She went right
to my guest room,

16:14.241 --> 16:16.276
closed the door, and slept.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.111
For 18 hours.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.713
I checked on her,
that's when I saw the bruises

16:20.747 --> 16:22.082
on her neck and wrists.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.485
- She was mugged.

16:25.518 --> 16:29.156
You know, working here,
I have seen my share of rapes.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.258
Tara had all the signs.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.126
I pled with her
to go to the police.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.494
I said I'd go with her.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.731
- She cried.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.501
She stayed a week,
and then she was gone.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.536
No good-bye, nothing.

16:43.570 --> 16:47.274
I get it, she was pissed at me.
Why was she pissed?

16:47.307 --> 16:51.178
- I took photos of her bruises
while she was sleeping.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.450
Tara's sister took
these photos the next day.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.486
- They seem to
corroborate her story.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.554
- The other crew members
don't necessarily agree.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.456
They say that
Carter reported Tara

17:03.490 --> 17:05.258
because of an Instagram post
she took eight months ago.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.294
And now, here's strike two.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.197
The bartender at Hyland Suites,
he remembers Tara and Carter

17:10.230 --> 17:12.199
drinking up a storm,
they closed the bar down.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.335
Now he said that it was
Tara that pushed Carter

17:15.368 --> 17:18.071
to have one last drink.
- Strike three.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.639
They're putting
Carter's face on a mountain.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.575
He's set to appear on "Seth"
and the "Today Show."

17:22.609 --> 17:25.745
- Lieutenant,
I believe Tara was raped. I do.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.215
But even with the terrorism
charge getting dropped,

17:28.248 --> 17:29.782
we're swimming upstream.

17:29.816 --> 17:33.520
- I couldn't agree more.
Lieutenant, a word.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.659
The stories of what
these passengers

17:39.692 --> 17:41.461
went through is horrific.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.630
This is a federal case;
maybe the Feds should take it.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.433
- By way of the DOJ.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.868
They don't need Special Victims
inventing a defense for her.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.804
- Chief, I believe
that she was raped.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.773
- And when you measure
one woman's tragedy

17:53.806 --> 17:56.243
against the lives
of those 135 people

17:56.276 --> 17:58.678
aboard that plane who are now
suffering from PTSD--

17:58.711 --> 18:01.114
- Please don't go there.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.116
- The woman had options.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.651
When she saw Carter
was flying that plane,

18:04.684 --> 18:07.720
she could have turned around.
Chosen not to fly.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.257
- Optimum Air knew
that Carter raped her,

18:10.290 --> 18:14.327
and still, they put her
in that cockpit with him.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.565
- Fine.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.502
But if you proceed
with this case,

18:22.535 --> 18:24.371
I suggest you get yourself
a big umbrella,

18:24.404 --> 18:25.905
because the skies
are going to open up

18:25.938 --> 18:27.774
and a lot of federal crap
is going to come

18:27.807 --> 18:29.209
raining down on your head.

18:29.242 --> 18:32.545
- My umbrella is...

18:32.579 --> 18:34.347
plenty big.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.422
*

18:42.455 --> 18:45.458
You know I'll do it.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.628
- Let's just get Tara in here.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.598
We need to hammer out the
inconsistencies in her story.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.171
- Logan is smart.
Calculating.

18:58.205 --> 19:01.941
He doesn't just
come out and demand sex.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.844
He'd happen to mention a high
end razor he bought his wife.

19:04.877 --> 19:10.317
Then he'd ask me if I preferred
bikini wax or Brazilian.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.386
It's weird, sure,
but I could shrug it off.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.856
- Meanwhile, the bastard's
got a pubescent fantasy.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.858
- It wasn't just Logan.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.294
All the pilots
told dirty jokes.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.730
They'd offer to rub my
shoulders on the long haul.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.400
It was a boy's club.
- Been there, done that.

19:27.434 --> 19:31.938
- If I object, I'm the prude.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.541
- Until Logan smacked my ass.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.376
I read him the riot act,

19:36.409 --> 19:38.878
and that's when the Instagram
photo that was up for months

19:38.911 --> 19:41.348
became an issue.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.551
- If I ever wanted to see
the inside of a cockpit again,

19:44.584 --> 19:45.885
I had to play ball.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.255
- Tara, the bartender
at Hyland Suites

19:48.288 --> 19:51.358
claims that you and Logan
were having drinks,

19:51.391 --> 19:53.893
and that it looked like you
were having a good time.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.364
- Logan apologized
for grounding me.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.300
He said he was
having problems at home.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.969
I ordered us another drink
to show him we were good.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.871
- But the defense
is going to argue

20:04.904 --> 20:07.507
that the sex
was then consensual.

20:07.540 --> 20:12.011
- Logan walked me to my room.
He kissed on the lips.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.247
I slapped him hard.

20:14.281 --> 20:18.685
When I opened my hotel door,
he pushed his way in.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.953
I tried to fight him off,

20:20.987 --> 20:23.356
he pulled me
by the back of my head.

20:23.390 --> 20:28.328
Threw me on the bed,
and he put his hand

20:28.361 --> 20:30.330
on my throat.
I couldn't speak.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.733
He forced my legs open
and he raped me.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.671
Nothing about that
was consensual, nothing.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.809
- It's a he said, she said.
Only he's a hero,

20:42.842 --> 20:44.411
and she's a crazy lady
who took a plane hostage.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.812
- Guys like Carter,

20:45.845 --> 20:47.547
Tara couldn't have been
his first victim.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.316
- Well, if there's
someone else,

20:49.349 --> 20:50.550
Optimum Air is not going
to help us find her.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.353
We need
something stronger, Liv.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.589
- It's called
a controlled call.

20:56.623 --> 21:00.727
- No, Logan is too smart.
I'll read this, and he'll know.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.298
I'll do it cold.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.434
- Okay, okay, but if
you start to panic,

21:07.467 --> 21:08.835
you have the script
to refer to.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.937
Okay, you ready?

21:18.411 --> 21:22.382
- Hi, Logan. It's me, Tara.

21:22.415 --> 21:26.319
- Wow.
I knew you had balls, but--

21:28.588 --> 21:30.323
But what they're
saying about me,

21:30.357 --> 21:32.692
how can you just stand by
and play the hero?

21:32.725 --> 21:34.327
After what you did to me?

21:35.995 --> 21:37.764
Please, what I did to you

21:37.797 --> 21:39.999
was give you what
you'd been asking for.

21:40.032 --> 21:44.003
- That's not what happened.
I know it, and you know it.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.738
- All I know is, nobody cares.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.341
Not after that stunt
you pulled.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.578
- Sounds like
a confession to me.

21:51.611 --> 21:54.714
- Carter lands at JFK,
5:30 a.m.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.617
He's on
"The Today Show" tomorrow.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.318
- Pick him up.

22:00.687 --> 22:05.425
*

22:11.498 --> 22:14.701
- Yay! Yes, Carter!

22:14.734 --> 22:16.669
- Logan Carter,
you're under arrest

22:16.703 --> 22:18.371
for rape
in the first degree.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.706
Put your hands
behind your back.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.641
He's a hero.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.876
- Please, let the police
do their job.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.778
This is all a misunderstanding.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.580
Come tomorrow,
I'll have your badge.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.516
Well come tomorrow,

22:29.549 --> 22:31.451
there's going to be a new
T-shirt that hits the stands.

22:38.825 --> 22:38.991
.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.560
Please.

22:40.593 --> 22:41.928
What I did to you was give you
what you'd been asking for.

22:44.030 --> 22:48.167
- That's not what happened.
I know it, and you know it.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.769
- All I know is nobody cares,

22:49.802 --> 22:51.904
not after that
stunt you pulled.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.941
- That's your probable cause
for arresting my client?

22:54.974 --> 22:56.609
Handcuffing him in public?

22:56.643 --> 22:59.078
Seems like the definition

22:59.111 --> 23:00.647
of a flight risk to me.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.049
- Captain Carter
is a national hero.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.084
- And Captain Carter
is a sexual predator.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.954
- It's called corroboration.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.523
That, and the photos
of Tara's bruises,

23:10.557 --> 23:11.658
fill in the blanks
in her story.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.159
- Story's a good word for it,

23:13.192 --> 23:14.694
since she made
the whole damn thing up.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.862
- Okay, great.
Why don't you give us

23:15.895 --> 23:17.196
your version?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.466
- We had sex.
Just like other people

23:19.499 --> 23:20.933
who meet at a bar.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.703
I'm guilty of cheating
on my wife, that's all.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.472
- Did Optimum Air tell you

23:25.505 --> 23:27.874
she filed a complaint
about being raped?

23:27.907 --> 23:30.677
- No, the airline
extorted Tara's silence

23:30.710 --> 23:32.812
by promising her a promotion.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.681
- You've got to know how to fly
before you become a pilot.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.082
That's why she
never made captain.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.551
- Because she'd risk

23:38.585 --> 23:41.854
killing over 100 people because
she didn't get what she wanted.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.823
- We're done here.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.593
- It's a pleasure
doing business with you,

23:46.626 --> 23:48.495
we'll see you
in court, counselor.

23:48.528 --> 23:49.862
- I'll be there.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.933
- I used to think
pilots were sexy.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.668
Silly me.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.671
- Let's hope the jury
isn't blinded by the uniform.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.877
- Captain Carter
saved hundreds of lives.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.947
Including the life
of Tara Sidnana.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.817
Optimum Air
stands behind him.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.719
We're confident that the jury

24:12.752 --> 24:15.888
is going to find these charges
a desperate attempt

24:15.922 --> 24:18.257
by Ms. Sidnana
to avoid culpability.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.859
- They all hate me.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.794
- Because they don't know
what happened.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.730
They need to hear the truth.
- It doesn't matter what

24:23.763 --> 24:25.264
anybody thinks except for
the jury.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.966
- Listen, you know
how to focus.

24:26.999 --> 24:30.269
You focus on your testimony.
Let's go.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.110
- I went to Kevin Reed
at Optimum Air.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.714
He said if I didn't go to
the police, they'd promote me.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.017
- Objection.
- Withdrawn. Tara.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.653
Why didn't you quit?

24:46.686 --> 24:48.621
Why didn't you get a job
at another airline?

24:48.655 --> 24:50.990
- I wanted to make captain.

24:51.023 --> 24:54.627
I've been training for it
my entire career.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.896
If I quit, no one
would have hired me.

24:56.929 --> 25:00.767
And Optimum promised I'd never
have to fly with Carter.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.803
- Yes.

25:03.836 --> 25:07.139
- You've pled guilty
to federal charges.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.642
- Yes.

25:09.676 --> 25:13.980
I'll serve two years.
I lost my pilot's license.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.916
I am not here
to mitigate my actions.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.818
- Thank you.

25:22.989 --> 25:26.926
- You claim that you reported
the alleged sexual assault

25:26.959 --> 25:28.628
to Optimum Air.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.163
Are you aware they have
no record of that?

25:31.197 --> 25:32.799
- They must have destroyed it.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.834
- Shredded all
the paperwork, huh?

25:34.867 --> 25:37.169
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.072
- Isn't it true that the first
time you told someone

25:40.106 --> 25:44.010
outside of Optimum
that you had been assaulted,

25:44.043 --> 25:47.046
was when you were handcuffed
in federal custody?

25:47.079 --> 25:49.081
- Yes.
- After you had locked

25:49.115 --> 25:53.352
the captain out of the cockpit,
and tried to crash the plane.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.888
- I didn't want
to crash the plane.

25:55.922 --> 25:59.258
I was trapped two feet away
from the man who raped me.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.093
I just wanted
to get out of there.

26:01.127 --> 26:04.697
- Tell us, Ms. Sidnana,
why didn't you bolt

26:04.731 --> 26:06.332
as soon as you saw
Captain Carter

26:06.365 --> 26:07.700
sitting in the cockpit?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.135
- I had to do my job.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.103
If I walked out,
it would go on my record.

26:11.137 --> 26:14.641
- And you'd never get promoted.
- It was more than that.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.375
I couldn't risk
showing weakness,

26:16.408 --> 26:17.877
the weak are not meant to fly.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.812
- But you were weak,
weren't you?

26:19.846 --> 26:22.381
When you intentionally
flew off course.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.852
- Maybe I was weak.

26:25.885 --> 26:29.922
If I wasn't weak, Logan
couldn't have raped me, right?

26:29.956 --> 26:33.259
If I wasn't weak, I wouldn't
have believed Optimum's lies.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.027
That's what you're thinking.

26:35.061 --> 26:38.264
Maybe I'd just confirmed
what they already thought.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.866
Women don't belong
in their club.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.734
- You were too weak
to do your job.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.736
Now you're blaming
Captain Carter.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.138
- Objection.
- He was so close.

26:46.172 --> 26:49.075
I could smell
the coffee on his breath.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.077
His deodorant.
When he touched me,

26:51.110 --> 26:54.146
I was right back in that hotel
room the night of the rape.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.749
I had to get out of there.
There's no other reason

26:56.783 --> 26:58.885
I'd turn the plane around.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.854
You sound like you have a lot
of rage against Optimum Air.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.155
- Objection, Your Honor.

27:03.189 --> 27:06.192
- Sustained,
jury will disregard.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.732
- I honestly don't know whether
she hurt us or she helped us.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.434
- Well, she has the right
to be angry.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.204
I get it.

27:19.906 --> 27:23.242
Jurors don't like
difficult women.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.311
- Especially female jurors.
I saw a few of them

27:25.344 --> 27:27.814
giving Carter the doe eye--
- Excuse me.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.750
Can you turn that up, please?

27:30.783 --> 27:32.184
- And while our main concern

27:32.218 --> 27:34.320
is the safety
of our passengers,

27:34.353 --> 27:38.057
and to ensure that an incident
like this never happens again,

27:38.090 --> 27:41.193
I'm compelled to speak out
in defense of Optimum Air

27:41.227 --> 27:46.465
and our dedicated
and heroic female pilots.

27:46.498 --> 27:50.970
All of whom are accorded the
same respect and consideration

27:51.003 --> 27:52.772
as our male pilots.

27:52.805 --> 27:56.175
- Yeah, in other words,
"screw you, Tara."

27:56.208 --> 27:57.977
- They have to blame her.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.747
They're looking at millions
of dollars in civil payouts.

28:00.780 --> 28:04.183
- I don't know what female
pilots he's talking about.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.486
Optimum only promoted one woman
to captain that we know about.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.121
- Hmm.
- She left the company

28:09.155 --> 28:12.191
last year, and she hasn't
returned our calls.

28:12.224 --> 28:16.729
- Well, Optimum try
to buy her off too?

28:19.866 --> 28:23.836
NYPD.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.371
- I told you, I can't talk
about Optimum.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.939
I left on good terms.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.508
- Two weeks after you
received your promotion?

28:29.541 --> 28:32.178
- I was done flying commercial.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.747
- Okay, I get it.
Flying private is better hours,

28:34.781 --> 28:36.916
better grade of passengers.

28:36.949 --> 28:40.452
It all worked out for you,
but not for Tara Sidnana.

28:40.486 --> 28:44.423
- I feel terrible for her.
I mean, what she did, it's...

28:44.456 --> 28:47.860
It's every pilot's nightmare.
- You worked for Optimum

28:47.894 --> 28:50.129
for what, ten years?

28:50.162 --> 28:53.232
You've logged just as many
hours as your male pilots.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.534
So in all that time,
you never got promoted?

28:55.567 --> 28:56.903
I mean, why do you
think that is?

28:56.936 --> 28:58.204
Is it because you're a woman?

28:58.237 --> 28:59.839
- I don't like
to play that card.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.307
- None of us do.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.909
You know, Optimum Air,
all they care about

29:02.942 --> 29:04.410
is protecting
their bottom line.

29:04.443 --> 29:07.479
If that means turning
a blind eye to harassment,

29:07.513 --> 29:10.883
discrimination, sexual assault.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.120
It's got to stop.
- Tara was raped, Jeanne.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.889
She tried to do her job,
she tried to get over it.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.025
And then she found herself
in that cockpit,

29:19.058 --> 29:21.994
face to face
with the man that raped her.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.463
So yes, she lost control.

29:24.496 --> 29:29.802
She's going to do prison time.
Logan Carter may walk.

29:29.836 --> 29:33.372
*

29:33.405 --> 29:34.974
My question to you is,

29:35.007 --> 29:37.309
how are you going
to live with yourself,

29:37.343 --> 29:39.812
if he gets away with it?

29:39.846 --> 29:44.216
How are you going to live with
yourself if he does it again?

29:46.018 --> 29:47.553
- You know, I, uh...

29:47.586 --> 29:51.323
I've agonized over the thought
of that plane going down.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.860
Every day.

29:53.893 --> 29:57.496
Could have been me.

30:19.551 --> 30:19.919
.

30:19.952 --> 30:20.519
Do you know

30:21.921 --> 30:23.055
what I did for her?

30:23.089 --> 30:24.423
- We know what you did to her.

30:24.456 --> 30:25.925
- You want to hear
about Jeanne Howell?

30:25.958 --> 30:27.293
I can keep you here for hours.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.161
- So luckily, Mrs. Howell
is meticulous.

30:29.195 --> 30:32.098
She's detail oriented, probably
what makes her a good pilot.

30:32.131 --> 30:35.434
She kept evidence
of the assault.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.203
Some of it ripped.

30:37.236 --> 30:40.239
Photos of the physical
trauma and emails

30:40.272 --> 30:42.074
between the two of
you after the rape.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.943
- You were a little
loose lipped, Captain.

30:43.976 --> 30:47.446
- Contemporary statements
to her friends.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.583
- The captain pleads guilty

30:51.617 --> 30:53.953
to two counts
of rape two, ten years.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.322
- We could go to trial,

30:56.355 --> 30:58.090
on Jeanne Howell's rape.

30:58.124 --> 31:01.193
If you're found guilty,
you're looking at 25 years.

31:04.230 --> 31:11.403
*

31:13.973 --> 31:17.009
- Draw up your paperwork.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.645
- We did it.

31:19.678 --> 31:24.951
- Give the guy a kewpie doll.
- Ten years is a long time.

31:24.984 --> 31:28.554
But you're not happy.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.589
Carter raped two women,
he sexually harassed

31:30.622 --> 31:32.591
what, who knows how many.

31:32.624 --> 31:35.161
Optimum knew,
and they did nothing.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.662
- So what are you saying,

31:36.695 --> 31:40.199
that putting away one
pilot rapist isn't enough?

31:40.232 --> 31:42.001
- Not in this day and age.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.103
It's the entire culture
that needs to change.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.571
All the people who enabled
Captain Carter

31:45.604 --> 31:46.973
should be
in that cell with him.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.008
- Yes, they should.

31:49.041 --> 31:54.280
But unfortunately, being
sexist, misogynistic pigs

31:54.313 --> 31:56.248
isn't a crime.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.050
- It should be.

32:00.052 --> 32:03.689
I'm serious.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.491
- What every prosecutor
that doesn't know

32:05.524 --> 32:07.726
what to charge does,
convene a grand jury.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.564
- The whole damn company.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.305
- The cockpit can be
an intimate space.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.173
Some male pilots took that
as an opportunity

32:21.207 --> 32:23.309
to discuss personal issues:

32:23.342 --> 32:25.544
their marriages, sex lives,

32:25.577 --> 32:28.080
what kind of pornography
they liked.

32:28.114 --> 32:30.149
- Did these conversations
go further?

32:30.182 --> 32:32.484
- Yes, I was propositioned.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.386
Everything from
"How about a drink?"

32:34.420 --> 32:37.589
to "Let's see what's
underneath that uniform"

32:37.623 --> 32:40.659
to graphic questions about
what I liked in bed.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.629
- No.

32:43.662 --> 32:46.032
Flying is
a male-dominated field.

32:46.065 --> 32:49.401
Truth is, a lot of male pilots
don't like flying with women.

32:49.435 --> 32:53.472
So you try to fit in.
Be one of the boys.

32:53.505 --> 32:56.075
- And you eventually
did get promoted?

32:56.108 --> 32:57.609
- Yes.

32:57.643 --> 33:02.214
After I was raped by one
of their pilots, Logan Carter.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.483
I went to management,

33:04.516 --> 33:06.585
and they promised me
that I would make captain

33:06.618 --> 33:09.455
if I didn't go to the police.

33:12.091 --> 33:16.028
- My self-esteem and my
confidence were destroyed.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.530
I knew that the only reason
they promoted me

33:18.564 --> 33:20.399
was to keep me quiet.

33:21.667 --> 33:27.239
I felt cheap.
I felt devalued.

33:27.273 --> 33:30.176
- You get hit on
by the passengers all the time.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.211
Like, you laugh off
creepy pickup lines

33:32.244 --> 33:34.813
or duck around the guy trying
to grab your ass in the aisle.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.748
- What about harassment
from the crew?

33:36.782 --> 33:38.384
- When the police
first asked me about that,

33:38.417 --> 33:39.751
I defended the company.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.388
- Okay, but now you want
to come forward.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.357
- Yes, people should
know the truth.

33:45.391 --> 33:48.260
Male pilots are worse
than passengers.

33:48.294 --> 33:52.298
A pilot will pretend to hug you
so he can look down your bra,

33:52.331 --> 33:55.767
or text you "What color panties
are you wearing?"

33:55.801 --> 33:58.270
- When I did,

33:58.304 --> 34:00.306
they said if I had a problem
with a particular crew,

34:00.339 --> 34:01.773
I would be reassigned.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.410
What ended up happening
was I lost flights.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.413
Hours, pay.
- So when you complained,

34:07.446 --> 34:09.081
you basically
got your salary docked.

34:09.115 --> 34:12.784
- Yes. I put my
game face on, I smiled.

34:12.818 --> 34:16.755
I tried to ignore it, no matter
how crude these guys got.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.359
You don't cry.
You don't fight back.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.128
You just take it.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.797
- It's going well.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.799
But getting the indictment
is the easy part...

34:27.833 --> 34:30.636
and we're not even there yet.

34:30.669 --> 34:33.172
Huh, we may not
get there at all.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.374
Optimum Air is filing a motion

34:35.407 --> 34:37.143
to quash
the grand jury subpoena.

34:37.176 --> 34:40.279
- They can try.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.480
They're claiming
that the charges

34:41.513 --> 34:43.849
are vague and overbroad.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.785
- Okay, that's good.
That means they feel the heat.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.187
That means you're
getting to them.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.788
- Yeah.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.724
- Mr. Barba, hi,
I'm Ellen Grey,

34:52.758 --> 34:54.460
Mr. Fleming's assistant.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.628
You subpoenaed me to testify.
- Ah, yes, of course.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.697
Please, come in.
- You also asked me for

34:58.730 --> 35:00.366
the employee company records.

35:00.399 --> 35:03.169
The more sensitive documents,
I keep at home.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.171
Mr. Fleming asked me
to shred them.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.306
But, I...

35:07.339 --> 35:10.742
There's something
I thought you should have.

35:10.776 --> 35:15.347
- Thank you so much
for coming forward.

35:15.381 --> 35:18.650
- And the way that company
treats women is despicable.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.921
But I can't stay quiet anymore.

35:36.402 --> 35:36.535
.

35:36.568 --> 35:37.503
- I saw a lot of women
come and go out of Optimum.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.607
Women who made complaints
about male employees,

35:41.640 --> 35:44.210
seems like there was always
a way to shut them up.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.878
- Why did you
come forward today, Ms. Gray?

35:46.912 --> 35:49.648
- I guess at some point,
enough is enough.

35:52.318 --> 35:57.356
- Can you describe this
for the grand jurors?

35:58.790 --> 36:02.428
- It's a memo Mr. Fleming
drafted five years ago.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.596
It was circulated among
the male executives.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.765
I was the only woman
who read it.

36:06.798 --> 36:10.669
Because I typed it.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.642
*

36:16.675 --> 36:19.578
- "It has come to my attention
that there is scientific data

36:19.611 --> 36:21.413
"supporting the fact
that women,

36:21.447 --> 36:23.249
"no matter how
well trained they are,

36:23.282 --> 36:27.219
"may not be mentally
or emotionally equipped

36:27.253 --> 36:29.755
"to captain an aircraft.

36:29.788 --> 36:33.492
"It is not a natural
career choice for females.

36:33.525 --> 36:37.296
"The resulting anxiety can lead
them to make poor decisions,

36:37.329 --> 36:38.964
"which may have
severe consequences,

36:38.997 --> 36:40.832
"including endangering lives.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.270
"It is my opinion that women
may be better suited

36:44.303 --> 36:48.307
for the career of flight
attendant than pilot."

36:49.708 --> 36:51.009
- Thank you, Ms. Gray.

36:51.042 --> 36:57.849
*

36:57.883 --> 37:00.419
You know what, I don't think
you have a clue

37:00.452 --> 37:01.720
about anything
you heard here today,

37:01.753 --> 37:03.255
You know how I know?

37:03.289 --> 37:04.823
You just don't look
that intelligent.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.825
And you, miss, where the hell
did you get that dress?

37:06.858 --> 37:10.296
Salvation Army wouldn't even
put that on its shelves.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.963
Um, I'm sure you know
you're only here

37:11.997 --> 37:13.699
because we're forced
to let you in.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.501
I forgot to tell you,

37:15.534 --> 37:17.403
that because you're not
as smart as the other jurors,

37:17.436 --> 37:20.672
your vote, it's going
to count less than theirs.

37:20.706 --> 37:23.275
You're not really
worth anything.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.544
Day after day,
you can sense it.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.313
I mean, they don't really...

37:27.346 --> 37:28.880
They don't really say it
to your face,

37:28.914 --> 37:30.616
but you know what
they're thinking.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.985
You can tell, because the guy
in the next office?

37:34.019 --> 37:35.987
He's making twice
what you make,

37:36.021 --> 37:37.623
and he does half the work.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.425
Year after year.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.860
You can tell because
that promotion,

37:41.893 --> 37:44.330
that you've been waiting for,

37:44.363 --> 37:48.434
is gone to your boss's
golfing buddy.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.969
You try to complain
to anyone who will listen,

37:51.002 --> 37:52.738
And one of two things
will happen.

37:52.771 --> 37:56.007
You'll get fired,
or you get laughed at.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.610
Why?

37:58.644 --> 38:04.015
Because they don't really want
you here in the first place.

38:04.049 --> 38:07.719
Year after year.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.758
Until you start
to believe it yourself.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.693
These may sound like
rationalizations to you,

38:14.726 --> 38:15.994
ladies and gentleman,
but to me,

38:16.027 --> 38:17.796
to the women of Optimum Air,

38:17.829 --> 38:22.568
that's the sound of a woman's
dignity circling the bowl.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.570
And the hand that's
flushing the toilet

38:24.603 --> 38:26.805
belongs not just to the men
who committed these offenses,

38:26.838 --> 38:32.644
but to everyone who knew
and let them happen.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.380
Can you be demeaned
by a culture?

38:34.413 --> 38:35.781
I say yes.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.916
Can it humiliate you?
You bet it can.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.420
Can it actually rape you?

38:41.453 --> 38:44.523
Sadly, the answer is yes.

38:46.692 --> 38:51.997
The law states that if you
take another person's property,

38:52.030 --> 38:53.932
you are committing a crime.

38:53.965 --> 39:00.806
I stand here before you today
to assert that Optimum Air

39:00.839 --> 39:06.545
took the dignity,
the self-worth,

39:06.578 --> 39:10.816
the self-esteem of these women.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.151
And if you don't think
that's property,

39:13.184 --> 39:15.921
just ask her.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.423
Or her.

39:17.456 --> 39:20.859
Or her.
Or her.

39:22.528 --> 39:23.962
And after you do,

39:23.995 --> 39:26.565
I ask you to return
a true bill of indictment,

39:26.598 --> 39:29.401
charging Optimum Air and all
of its employees

39:29.435 --> 39:34.673
with grand larceny.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.507
Thank you.

39:35.541 --> 39:41.447
*

39:41.480 --> 39:42.814
- Congratulations
on the indictment.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.486
The first thing Optimum will do
is make a motion to dismiss.

39:47.519 --> 39:50.722
Which they'll win,
but I get to appeal.

39:50.756 --> 39:54.426
- 60/40, against.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.861
But we got the wheels turning.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.663
If this law's
ever going to change,

39:57.696 --> 39:59.665
this is a good start.
- You know, I thought

39:59.698 --> 40:03.535
that grand jury
proceedings were secret.

40:03.569 --> 40:07.906
- They are, but that courthouse
leaks like a sieve.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.876
Optimum's stock is down 30%,
they'll be declaring bankruptcy

40:10.909 --> 40:12.143
by the end of the week.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.145
- You're a
feminist icon, Rafael.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.914
- Hmm.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.616
I do my best.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.118
I think that earns me
a nice, thick steak.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.020
- I would love
nothing more, but--

40:23.722 --> 40:25.457
- Yeah.

40:25.491 --> 40:27.593
- I know.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.432
- Detective Tutuola.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.806
Can I help you with something?

40:40.839 --> 40:43.208
- Just wanted to ask you
about your intentions

40:43.241 --> 40:46.044
regarding, you know, Liv.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.548
- You know she's
been through hell.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.517
- I know that.
- She'll survive.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.752
She'll get past it,
and she's the only one

40:53.785 --> 40:55.721
that can do this job.
You know that, right?

40:55.754 --> 40:56.922
- I do.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.858
- Well, the rumors
I'm hearing from 1PP,

40:59.891 --> 41:03.194
about you interviewing
candidates to replace her.

41:03.228 --> 41:06.197
Those are just rumors?

41:06.231 --> 41:09.034
- Two weeks ago, I wasn't sure
she was coming back

41:09.067 --> 41:11.670
to the job.
Hell, she wasn't even sure.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.505
I've got a department to run.

41:13.539 --> 41:16.675
Bosses to answer to.
- Don't we all.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.110
- Yeah.

41:19.144 --> 41:22.247
One more thing.

41:23.014 --> 41:29.988
*

41:31.723 --> 41:35.827
- I can't tell you that.
And I made a copy.

41:35.861 --> 41:39.565
Just want to make sure
we do understand each other.

41:39.598 --> 41:42.734
- We do, Detective.
We do.

41:42.768 --> 41:47.005
It's good to see you,
as always.
