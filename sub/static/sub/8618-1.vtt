00:37.171 --> 00:39.571
They called him Machete.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.835
$70 a day for yard work.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.572
100 for roofing.

00:45.679 --> 00:46.941
Get in.

00:47.014 --> 00:49.539
125 for septic.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.083
Sewage.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.914
Have you ever killed anyone before?

00:54.121 --> 00:57.022
As you may know,
illegal aliens such as yourself

00:57.091 --> 00:59.855
are being forced out of our country
at an alarming rate.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.418
for the good of both our people.

01:02.496 --> 01:05.158
Our new senator must die.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.395
And for that I will pay you $150,000...

01:09.470 --> 01:10.459
cash.

01:10.537 --> 01:13.335
He was given an offer
he couldn't refuse.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.236
I cost the most...

01:17.544 --> 01:19.273
'cause I'm the best there is.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.344
Aah!

01:27.421 --> 01:29.981
Set up, double-crossed,

01:30.057 --> 01:32.389
and left for dead.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.893
I took a vow of peace.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.897
And now you want me
to help you kill all these men?

01:37.965 --> 01:39.557
Yes, bro.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.534
I mean, Padre.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.037
I'll see what I can do.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.212
He knows the score.

01:56.216 --> 01:57.774
Where are my wife and daughter?!

01:58.819 --> 02:00.616
He gets the women.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.177
He's back

02:02.256 --> 02:03.621
Machete

02:04.658 --> 02:06.683
And he kills the bad guys.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.556
No!

02:08.362 --> 02:10.853
Oh, shit.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.297
You mean that a Mexican day laborer

02:13.367 --> 02:16.268
is a goddamn Federale?!

02:16.336 --> 02:18.600
But they soon realized...

02:18.672 --> 02:19.934
He's coming after us.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.775
...they just fucked with the wrong Mexican.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.172
- Uhh!
- Action.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.116
Suspense.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.381
Aaaah!

02:35.456 --> 02:36.388
Emotion.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.652
Please, Father, have mercy.

02:38.725 --> 02:41.751
God has mercy. I don't.

02:42.296 --> 02:46.995
If you're gonna
hire Machete to kill the bad guy,

02:47.067 --> 02:52.630
you better make damn sure
the bad guy isn't you.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.135
Machete

02:59.580 --> 03:00.979
Rated "X".

03:03.183 --> 03:07.017
Brought to you from your friends
at The Weinstein Company.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.804
Real pretty tonight, Holly.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.362
God damn it, girls.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.841
If you're gonna do that shit,
do it onstage!

06:51.878 --> 06:53.869
Smokin' hot. Whew!

06:57.584 --> 07:00.747
Cherry, darlin',
I told you too many fuckin' times--

07:00.821 --> 07:02.755
you can't be up there cryin'
and all that shit.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.552
You know what a go-go dance is?

07:05.459 --> 07:07.222
Useless talent number 12?

07:07.294 --> 07:09.285
No, it's a happy dance.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.296
You get up there
and you dance happy.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.594
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

07:14.534 --> 07:15.592
I'm quitting.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.466
You say that
at least one night a week.

07:17.537 --> 07:20.005
I mean it this time.

07:20.073 --> 07:24.476
I need a dramatic change in my life.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.909
I've always said you're funny.

07:25.979 --> 07:29.005
Like that Chris Rock...
only prettier.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.674
But if you don't stop
all that cryin' and shit,

07:30.751 --> 07:32.048
I'm gonna have to fire
your fuckin' ass,

07:32.119 --> 07:34.019
and I don't want to fire your ass
'cause I like lookin' at your ass.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.078
"Any girl leaving early"

07:36.156 --> 07:37.919
"must check out with their finger"

07:37.991 --> 07:40.118
"and have a bye-bye slip."

07:41.795 --> 07:43.160
Here's my finger.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.359
And here's my bye-bye slip.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.770
We're gonna need some cash.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.161
Dick. Fuck!

08:16.229 --> 08:17.218
Aah!

08:17.297 --> 08:18.491
Oh!

08:26.540 --> 08:28.007
Ass bag!

08:33.613 --> 08:34.602
Aah!

08:48.962 --> 08:50.862
All right, boys. Come on.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.695
All right, all right. Come on.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.207
You guys know the drill, huh?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.245
Wait here, Lieutenant.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.806
I'll handle this.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.680
Hey, Abby.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.117
I can see you've had
a spot of trouble, Romey.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.858
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

09:23.930 --> 09:25.898
Well, they--they escaped.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.024
Uh...

09:27.100 --> 09:29.534
All three?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.070
Yeah, l--

09:31.137 --> 09:32.536
I don't know, uh--

09:32.606 --> 09:34.335
I don't know how they did it.
Just, they got out--

09:34.407 --> 09:37.103
I'm sorry, Romey,
but I just don't trust you anymore.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.035
And you know the rules.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.137
Hold on.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.012
I'm out.
I swear, Abby, I'm--I'm--

09:44.084 --> 09:45.483
You're not gonna
see me anymore, okay?

09:45.552 --> 09:46.951
Not so fast.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.490
I also want your balls.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.764
I'm really quite attached to them.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.568
Oh, sweetheart.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.166
I was really attached to my specimens.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.838
Now they're out there in the night
doing God knows what.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.405
I can't do it, Abby. Please.
Please, Abby.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.347
Hey. Hey! What are you guys--

10:21.421 --> 10:22.979
Let me go, you motherfuckers!

10:23.056 --> 10:25.490
Son of a bitch!
Abby! Listen!

10:25.558 --> 10:26.820
You don't need Abby!

10:26.893 --> 10:27.860
There's more!

10:27.928 --> 10:29.725
There's more!
I can get you all you want! Abby!

10:29.796 --> 10:32.356
Fuck!. Motherfucking pussies!

10:32.432 --> 10:34.764
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
I can get you more!

10:34.834 --> 10:36.563
No! No! No! Aah!

10:36.636 --> 10:39.230
Aaaaah!

10:47.414 --> 10:48.745
Pick this up, please.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.674
Where's the shit?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.649
The shit's right there.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.350
The deal is still good.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.056
No, it's not.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.153
You held out on me.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.256
Now I want all of it.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.484
Uhh!

12:06.659 --> 12:08.923
Looks like I got you
by the balls, Abby.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.724
You certainly have.

12:10.797 --> 12:11.821
So...

12:14.300 --> 12:16.165
I'll ask you one more time.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.069
Where's...

12:20.040 --> 12:21.302
the...

12:22.308 --> 12:23.935
shit?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.604
Everywhere.

13:07.687 --> 13:08.984
Oh, balls.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.456
Get that thing away from my pumps!

13:54.534 --> 13:56.161
It's just overheating.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.266
I need to get to town.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.540
It's just a stripped radiator cap.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.011
Water leaks when it heats up.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.850
No pressure.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.252
You okay?

14:18.324 --> 14:20.724
I'm just cherry.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.954
Go on and have a seat anywhere.
I'll be right in.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.592
Here, take this with you.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.363
That's your good spring water.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.563
Ain't nothin' good about it.
I bottled it myself.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.368
I get it right there out of the dam.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.342
Thanks...

14:37.410 --> 14:38.900
J.T.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.809
We're serving inside tonight.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.871
The best barbecue in Texas
around the clock.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.211
I gotta go.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.377
Savin' lives, are you?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.719
Now, how did you know that?

14:58.097 --> 14:59.928
Now, that's a rump roast.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.728
Mmm.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.609
Open the shades.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.778
Get some light in here.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.227
Nice night.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.996
Coffee.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.068
Oh, shit.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.665
I couldn't get off work this week.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.340
But you only have to stay till 10:00.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.243
A friend of mine will be here before
10:00 to pick up Tony.

15:51.317 --> 15:54.252
I'm going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.584
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.453
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.526
There's a packed suitcase
under his bed.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.063
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.398
I'll leave him watching TV.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.208
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes.

16:21.547 --> 16:22.639
Thank you.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.916
Hey, what happened to your tooth?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.650
Fell out.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.487
Wow.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.720
Think you can say a prayer
for your old man?

16:36.796 --> 16:39.822
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.663
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
Amen.

16:42.735 --> 16:43.963
Amen.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.072
Who was that you were talking to?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.507
Babysitter.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.277
She's on her way.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.312
- You believe her?
- No.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.314
Me, neither.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.435
Fucking catastrophe.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.606
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.335
- How's it goin', J.T.?
- All right.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.714
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah, all night.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.342
Cup of coffee
and a pack of cigarettes, please.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.184
Free of charge.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.656
Tonight...

18:12.725 --> 18:14.317
is a special night.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.023
What's so special about tonight?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.928
Been open 25 years.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.608
You should've thrown a party.

18:30.676 --> 18:32.439
I did. See the balloons?

18:32.512 --> 18:35.379
You're the second person
to show up tonight.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.609
Who's the first?

18:37.683 --> 18:38.945
Right there.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.551
Must be passin' through.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.321
Seems only strangers eat here.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.120
I still eat here, J.T.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.859
Oh, yeah, you sure do.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.333
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you're eatin'.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.337
Hello, Palomita.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.550
I don't go by that name anymore.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.081
Why not?

19:16.823 --> 19:19.223
'Cause it's the name you gave me.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.761
So, uh...

19:24.831 --> 19:27.823
you ever become that--
that fancy doctor?

19:30.236 --> 19:31.430
Never did.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.737
I thought for sure you would.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.771
Talked about it enough.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.073
That's the problem with goals--

19:40.146 --> 19:43.206
they become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

19:43.282 --> 19:45.375
That's my jacket.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.850
I looked for it for two weeks.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.513
Yeah? How long did you
look for me, Wray?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.353
Yeah, well, the jacket belonged to me.
You didn't.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.558
So, um...

19:56.629 --> 19:58.062
what are you doing now?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.727
I'm going to be a standup comedian.

20:04.770 --> 20:05.896
Really?

20:08.975 --> 20:10.704
You're not funny.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.269
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody,

20:14.347 --> 20:16.645
but they all say I'm hysterical.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.409
But you're not.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.952
Great. Well, that's just fantastic,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.955
because I believed everybody,
and I've already booked shows in town.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.354
Now what am I gonna do?

20:25.424 --> 20:28.621
Yeah. Yeah, that--
that sucks, really.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.820
There's a difference
between being frank

20:32.899 --> 20:35.299
and being dick.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.632
Yeah, well...

20:37.703 --> 20:39.671
it was really good seeing you again.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.500
Oh. Um...

20:42.575 --> 20:44.509
what name do you go by now...

20:44.577 --> 20:46.408
in case I want to catch
one of your shows?

20:46.479 --> 20:48.037
Cherry.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.874
Cherry Darling.

20:53.519 --> 20:54.577
Sxounds like a stripper.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.054
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.522
There's a difference.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.990
Right.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.151
Well...

21:03.062 --> 21:05.223
you'll always be Palomita to me.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.603
I need a ride.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.178
What do you say, El Wray?

21:29.855 --> 21:31.516
I'll give you a ride.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.030
Good-bye, Bill.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.364
- Don't you mean "see you later"?
- Of course.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.202
Hey. What's up, Doc?

21:49.408 --> 21:51.376
The little lady's lookin'
pretty good there, I gotta say.

21:51.444 --> 21:54.072
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.238
I'm kiddin'. Heh.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.974
- Take a look at that shit.
- What happened to your arm?

21:59.051 --> 22:01.315
Well, uh... I got bit.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.685
Bit? Bit by what?

22:03.756 --> 22:06.088
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.050
I need some Bactine or something?

22:10.229 --> 22:11.253
Whew.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.591
Can't you just...sew it up?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.362
Well, normally I would.

22:16.435 --> 22:19.233
I'd even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.466
The only problem is
this one doesn't bleed.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.337
Oh, shit. Check this out.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.570
When this was still a military hospital,

22:25.645 --> 22:27.670
this one guy came back
from lraq with this.

22:27.747 --> 22:28.771
Whew!

22:28.848 --> 22:31.009
Chronic herpetic lesions.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.643
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here,

22:33.719 --> 22:34.879
kind of like a fountain.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.444
Oh, Jesus.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.046
Well, how'd you treat it?

22:39.558 --> 22:42.254
Fuck that. I was never in lraq.

22:42.328 --> 22:44.455
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.430
I swear to God.
I've got these lraqi eyeballs

22:46.499 --> 22:48.467
a friend of mine brought back
to do some studies on.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.661
Incredible. They were
completely milked over.

22:50.736 --> 22:52.260
Mustard gas--
it does that to your eyes.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.737
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.637
Bot fly, do you think?

22:56.709 --> 23:00.042
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.773
That looks like gout.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.712
He's running a temperature of 105.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.412
- Is that bad?
- It's high.

23:07.486 --> 23:08.783
Bad will be 108.

23:08.854 --> 23:12.449
You could have a seizure,
go psychotic.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.755
And--and probably die.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.719
Say "ahh."

23:16.796 --> 23:19.230
- Alhh.
- Oh! Jesus!

23:19.298 --> 23:21.129
Oh, nice.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.565
Black abscessed tongue.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.126
All abscesses
should be drained, period.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.169
What are you doing?

23:34.346 --> 23:35.438
Shut up, Joe.

23:46.892 --> 23:49.520
Baby...get the needles.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.992
Be right there.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.331
Right now.

23:56.402 --> 23:57.266
Asshole.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.481
It's spreading.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.613
Holy shit.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.815
- When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.357
See this?

24:19.425 --> 24:22.826
This shows the advanced stages
of gangrene and epidermal rot.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.556
- And this over here...
- Advanced rot?

24:24.630 --> 24:28.225
...shows the swelling of tissues
and the lack of any type of circulation.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.768
See, you're telling me
that you just got this bite?

24:30.836 --> 24:33.304
- Yeah, just like a half hour ago.
- What I'm seeing here

24:33.372 --> 24:35.670
is a deep impact wound
with several virals

24:35.741 --> 24:37.402
and secondary bacterials,

24:37.476 --> 24:40.536
and that, by the accumulation of
denuded tissue around the incision marks,

24:40.613 --> 24:44.982
indicates that you've had this bite
for over 14 days.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.711
Uh... uh, at least 14 days.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.014
Could that be possible?

24:48.087 --> 24:50.647
14 days? No way. I mean--

24:50.723 --> 24:52.884
Well...what is today?

24:53.859 --> 24:55.190
Today's Wednesday.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.388
The 15th.

24:58.931 --> 24:59.955
Of April.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.626
Aw, hell. Can't I just get
a tetanus shot or something?

25:03.936 --> 25:05.699
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.500
Lose the arm?
What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?

25:07.573 --> 25:09.097
It's sppreading all the way
upp to your shoulder.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.905
Now, if we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,

25:11.977 --> 25:14.070
and we can't very well
cut that off, can we?

25:14.146 --> 25:15.670
Well, shouldn't I get a second oppinion?

25:16.382 --> 25:17.644
Hi, Joe.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.942
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic,

25:22.021 --> 25:24.285
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.448
These...

25:26.358 --> 25:27.757
...are my friends.

25:27.827 --> 25:28.953
My yellow friend...

25:30.863 --> 25:33.263
- ...is just to take the sting off.
- Aah!

25:33.999 --> 25:36.263
My blue friend...

25:36.335 --> 25:37.825
you'll barely feel.

25:37.903 --> 25:42.033
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.

25:42.107 --> 25:43.597
See how fast my friends work?

25:46.212 --> 25:48.578
And after my red-headed friend...

25:48.647 --> 25:50.740
... you'll never see me again.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.807
...see me again, see me again.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.923
They all react differently.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.322
Now what?

26:07.399 --> 26:09.390
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia--

26:09.468 --> 26:11.060
in loving memoy

26:23.816 --> 26:25.511
It's not the radiator.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.346
Damn it.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.233
All right.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.673
Fuckin' thing.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.506
Cheapp--whoa.

26:54.713 --> 26:55.873
Damn light.

26:56.682 --> 26:57.842
Ohh.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.957
Hey. Hey!

27:09.028 --> 27:10.859
Hey! Bastard!

27:10.930 --> 27:12.329
Bastard!

27:21.874 --> 27:23.398
Oh, thank God.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.533
Oh.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.437
Oh. Hey!

27:26.512 --> 27:28.002
Hey! Hey!

27:29.281 --> 27:31.306
Get outta
the fuckin' road, bitch!

27:43.295 --> 27:45.695
Ohh! Stop!

27:45.764 --> 27:46.890
Stop!

27:46.966 --> 27:48.763
Please! Stop!

27:51.503 --> 27:54.165
No! No!

28:09.521 --> 28:11.318
What the hell was that?

28:13.592 --> 28:15.617
People picking up road kill.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.252
What, like an armadillo?

28:18.197 --> 28:19.494
Deer.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.096
You get a lot of them around here.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.667
You know, I read a statistic that said...

28:25.738 --> 28:31.233
that the eating of venison has risen
30% in the last few years.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.540
60% of that's from road kill.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.548
People eat road kill?

28:36.615 --> 28:38.583
If you're driving out here
at 70 miles an hour

28:38.650 --> 28:40.379
and a deer darts out
in front of you,

28:40.452 --> 28:43.580
if you blink or brake or swerve--

28:43.655 --> 28:45.384
shit, you'll just kill yourself.

28:45.457 --> 28:46.947
So, what do you do?

28:47.026 --> 28:48.618
Just ppick 'em off...

28:48.694 --> 28:50.161
just like this.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.719
Send it flying away from you.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.287
Unacceptable.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.889
Not really.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.895
It's just a clear case of you or him.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.405
Or her.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.071
Oh, fuck!

29:08.580 --> 29:10.639
Aah! Aah!

29:19.992 --> 29:21.016
Cherry?

29:22.561 --> 29:26.361
I thought you said if you saw a deer,
you shouldn't fucking swerve!

29:26.432 --> 29:27.831
It wasn't a deer.

29:29.735 --> 29:32.932
Cherry! Cherry! No!

29:51.390 --> 29:52.550
Aah!

30:05.370 --> 30:06.564
Palomita.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.768
- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?

30:12.845 --> 30:15.211
Car accident. Heavy contusions
about the torso,

30:15.280 --> 30:16.975
possible spinal trauma...

30:18.117 --> 30:19.641
one severed limb.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.480
Where's the leg?

30:22.554 --> 30:24.385
Three sickos attacked her.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.253
I shot at them.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.488
I never miss.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.157
They took the leg with them.

30:46.778 --> 30:49.372
You'll have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know?

30:49.448 --> 30:50.813
He has to sign her in.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.043
Do what, now?.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.017
Well, he's with her.
He's respponsible for her.

30:54.086 --> 30:57.055
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.

30:59.324 --> 31:00.518
Okay.

31:00.592 --> 31:01.923
Okay! Fuck!

31:03.362 --> 31:04.351
Hey, Block.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.733
No, you do it.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.700
Suit yourself.

31:16.842 --> 31:18.605
What are you doing
with a rifle, Wray?

31:20.012 --> 31:21.138
Nothing.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.875
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

31:23.949 --> 31:25.439
Come on, Wray.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.042
You know you're not supppposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.054
Not even hunting?

31:30.122 --> 31:32.488
Not even hunting.
And you know that.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.150
Not with your history.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.354
And here I stick my neck out for you.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.659
I stick it out far.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.461
Now you've got a gal in your wrecked truck
with a missing leg?

31:43.268 --> 31:45.429
A missing leg that's now missing?

31:45.504 --> 31:47.597
And here you're saying
in front of everybody

31:47.673 --> 31:49.504
that someone up and snatched it?

31:49.575 --> 31:50.974
And that you shot at 'em with a gun

31:51.043 --> 31:53.136
that you never should've had
in the first pplace?

31:53.212 --> 31:54.474
And that now they're gone?

31:55.480 --> 31:57.414
What if I find the leg?

31:57.482 --> 31:59.746
So, now you know where it is?

31:59.818 --> 32:02.810
You'll tell us where it is,
give us a full confession, you're saying?

32:02.888 --> 32:05.015
Sheriff, can we finish
this conversation somewhere else?

32:05.090 --> 32:06.250
My thought exactly.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.856
I know it sounds a little arrogant
puttin' upp a sign--

32:13.932 --> 32:16.423
"Best damn barbecue in Texas..."

32:16.501 --> 32:18.332
"Period."

32:19.905 --> 32:21.566
But, hell...

32:21.640 --> 32:23.801
who's gonna come in here
and argue about that?

32:26.078 --> 32:28.876
Oh, yeah.
Big contest comin' up.

32:29.748 --> 32:30.840
Mm.

32:31.717 --> 32:34.481
I'm workin' on the perfect sauce.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.547
Yeah.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.287
That'll put me on the Food Channel.

32:40.859 --> 32:43.350
Put this pplace back on the mapp
where it belongs.

32:43.428 --> 32:44.725
I'll talk to you later.

32:56.408 --> 32:59.673
Can I interest y'all in a plate of
soon-to-be-award-winnin' barbecue?

33:06.785 --> 33:08.582
You're from Dinky's, ain't ya?

33:09.588 --> 33:10.850
Well, you tell that sumbitch,

33:10.922 --> 33:13.516
he thinks he's gonna come over here
and get my recippes...

33:14.526 --> 33:17.825
well, I got a double-barreled answer
to his query right inside.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.964
God damn, that's good.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.830
Doctor Block!

33:29.908 --> 33:32.741
Three fresh ones rollin' in!

33:32.811 --> 33:33.937
Christ, you're kidding.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.242
Automobile accident
off of Highway 18.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.714
DOAs?

33:37.783 --> 33:39.182
Have Andy pick 'em up.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.947
He's already on 620
picking up another two.

33:42.921 --> 33:44.616
Fucking Wednesday nights.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.292
That's unsanitary, Doc.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.294
Not if I'm the only one using it.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.660
Helps me monitor
my state of calmness.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.199
Yeah, don't get all worked up
enough to crack it.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.256
Fuck.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.394
You might cut yourself pretty good.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.563
Then I'd know I was not calm.

34:07.112 --> 34:09.444
Yeah, what do you say now, Doc?

34:10.916 --> 34:12.907
Somebody call my wife.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.100
DC-2?

34:34.306 --> 34:35.431
Mm.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.132
Yeah.

34:40.145 --> 34:42.545
Well, what about
countering with atroppine?

34:45.516 --> 34:46.609
Yeah.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.588
Okay. Gotcha, gotcha.

34:53.558 --> 34:56.083
Well, boys, I'm beat.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.925
I gotta get home.
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

34:58.997 --> 35:01.329
All right, then.
Thanks for the extra help, Earl.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.061
Hey, Wray.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.762
You in trouble again?

35:04.836 --> 35:06.929
Just passin' through, I hope.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.131
Well, me, too.

35:08.206 --> 35:09.366
How's the wife, Earl?

35:12.010 --> 35:13.841
Well, she's not too good.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.004
Thanks for askin'.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.641
Most of it's her own doin', you know.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.810
Smokin' them goddamn cigarettes.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.513
Pack a day for 40 years.

35:23.655 --> 35:27.022
Yeah, she doesn't want anything
to do with, uh...chemo.

35:27.092 --> 35:31.051
So...it does take its toll.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.222
You don't smoke, do you, Wray?

35:34.166 --> 35:35.224
No.

35:36.101 --> 35:38.831
That's probably good.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.270
See y'all.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.443
You're gonna start by telling me

35:46.511 --> 35:48.206
when you first started
carrying this gun.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.544
And then we'll move up

35:51.616 --> 35:54.050
to when you first set eyes
on this gal Cherry.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.195
Okay.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.194
Okay.

36:52.410 --> 36:53.604
Sheriff Hague.

36:53.678 --> 36:55.475
It's J.t, Sheriff.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.606
J.T., how's the barbecue business?

36:59.084 --> 37:02.110
Ever since that bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.246
Well, I'm real sorry
to hear about that.

37:04.322 --> 37:05.721
I wish there was something
I could do.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.157
Right now I ain't callin' my brother.
I'm callin' the sheriff.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.593
I'm listening. What's the trouble?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.961
Well. there ain't no trouble.
Not yet. anyway.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.694
I got two delinquents been hangin'
around here for over an hour.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.895
They won't purchase
and they won't leave.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.334
Oh, never mind. Here they come.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.843
You cook that meat
at 250 degrees, don't you?

37:25.911 --> 37:28.607
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.513
You give me that recipe, or I'll raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.051
Brother. ain't no Texan's ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.280
That's a fact.
He'll take it to his grave.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.788
I could be bleedin' like a stuck pig.
I ain't gonna tell you.

37:38.857 --> 37:41.485
I could be dyin' in your arms.
I ain't gonna tell you!

37:41.560 --> 37:43.289
- Heh heh heh.
- We'll see about that.

37:47.465 --> 37:48.523
You gonna look.

37:50.168 --> 37:51.635
or you gonna eat?

38:00.278 --> 38:01.609
You called for me?

38:01.680 --> 38:03.511
I need for you to see this.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.408
Looks like a no-brainer.

38:07.485 --> 38:08.884
What does that mean?

38:08.954 --> 38:10.546
No brain.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.318
Scoopped clean out of her skull.

38:13.391 --> 38:15.120
Oh, oh, oh!
I know what this is.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.718
Don't tell me.
Uh... Iiquefactive necrosis.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.124
You think?

38:20.198 --> 38:21.358
Oh, sure, yeah.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.025
Thank you. That'll be all.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.874
Oh...

38:37.015 --> 38:39.176
Did you know she was back in town?

38:41.119 --> 38:42.279
No.

38:43.588 --> 38:44.919
I didn't.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.024
What happened to her?

38:53.465 --> 38:55.092
I don't know, baby.

39:00.438 --> 39:02.497
I thought you stopped
seeing each other.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.742
We have.

39:07.579 --> 39:10.548
Well, yes, you have now--
she's fucking dead.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.618
I mean, we--
we stopped before.

39:19.457 --> 39:20.651
I--

39:20.725 --> 39:22.920
I haven't talked to her in a while.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.062
But you've written each other.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.134
Here and there.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.969
But not--

39:37.042 --> 39:38.566
What are you doing?!

39:39.477 --> 39:41.945
Let me see your last three messages.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.748
- You have no right.
- I don't?

39:46.985 --> 39:49.783
I don't have a right?

39:52.390 --> 39:53.414
Show it to me.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.251
Show it to me.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.487
No.

39:58.463 --> 39:59.794
Aah!

39:59.864 --> 40:02.230
Now, that's just to take the sting off.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.261
Show it to me.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.329
No, please.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.274
- Show... it...to... me!
- Aaahh! Aah! Aah!

40:16.514 --> 40:19.074
Now let's see how fast
your friends work.

40:30.395 --> 40:31.760
That's pretty fast.

40:35.700 --> 40:38.601
Oh, what do I know, my love?

40:38.670 --> 40:40.331
Exactly.

40:40.405 --> 40:44.136
That you're a cheating, lying...

40:46.311 --> 40:48.142
sack.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.443
I didn't want to hurt you.

40:50.515 --> 40:53.075
But you did.

40:53.151 --> 40:54.516
Bill...

40:54.586 --> 40:56.645
you're insane.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.418
And I was afraid...

41:02.527 --> 41:04.791
of what you might do to me,

41:04.863 --> 41:06.694
to our son.

41:07.732 --> 41:10.030
I'm the mother of your son.

41:10.568 --> 41:11.557
Aah!

41:15.406 --> 41:17.374
And after this one...

41:18.810 --> 41:20.971
I'll never see you again.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.525
Doc.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.221
What?

41:38.296 --> 41:40.924
You gotta see this.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.591
I'll be right there.

41:53.778 --> 41:55.370
Where the hell are the bodies?

41:55.446 --> 41:57.380
That's what we wanted to show you.

41:57.448 --> 41:58.506
They're gone.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.881
They didn't just get upp
and walk out, did they?

42:01.953 --> 42:03.511
Mmm-hmm

42:08.593 --> 42:10.083
Shut the fuck up!

42:10.929 --> 42:13.830
Somebody take care of this perp for me
before I fucking kill him!

42:13.898 --> 42:14.887
What the hell's going on?

42:14.966 --> 42:17.628
Alh, he was causin' a ruckus
over at Skipp's place, so I cuffed him,

42:17.702 --> 42:21.399
and the son of a bitch
bit my goddamn finger off.

42:21.472 --> 42:24.066
Quit your hollerin' and get yourself
a goddamn Band-Aid.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.633
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.941
He bit my finger clean off!

42:29.013 --> 42:30.810
Fucking shit!

42:30.882 --> 42:32.577
Get out there and book him,

42:32.650 --> 42:34.618
'cause I'll fuckin' kill him
if I have to do it.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.244
Carlos, go get him.

42:37.288 --> 42:40.189
Wray, you stay put.

43:01.679 --> 43:03.442
Are you sure he's in there?

43:04.282 --> 43:06.011
He was.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.574
Motherfucker.

43:41.152 --> 43:42.380
He's gone.

43:43.288 --> 43:44.653
Broke out the window.

43:44.722 --> 43:46.690
Where's my finger?

43:46.758 --> 43:48.282
Found your ring.

43:48.359 --> 43:51.021
Could it be the same guy
as your leg-snatcher?

43:51.896 --> 43:53.989
I didn't get
a good look at mine.

43:57.735 --> 43:59.726
That him over there?

44:47.752 --> 44:48.719
Whoa! Whoa!

44:48.786 --> 44:50.117
Aah!

44:52.957 --> 44:54.754
Wray?

45:06.704 --> 45:07.898
Fuck.

45:11.943 --> 45:14.036
You motherfucker!

45:14.112 --> 45:15.340
Uhh!

45:45.676 --> 45:48.110
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?

45:48.179 --> 45:49.407
He's infected.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.879
With what?

45:50.948 --> 45:52.142
Everything.

45:52.216 --> 45:54.946
Wray!
Dropp the fuckin' gun.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.617
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?!

46:03.694 --> 46:05.685
I'm gonna go get Cherry!

46:05.763 --> 46:08.459
Fine. But we're taking my car.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.405
I'm riding with you.

46:17.341 --> 46:19.400
Don't make any sudden moves.

46:32.223 --> 46:33.713
Viral infections.

46:34.659 --> 46:36.957
They came pouring in.

46:37.028 --> 46:39.963
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions.

46:40.031 --> 46:42.056
Highly contagious.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.896
What do you think?

46:44.936 --> 46:47.496
Self-preservation comes to mind.

46:47.572 --> 46:50.063
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

46:51.375 --> 46:53.707
First let me get my wife.

48:00.811 --> 48:02.904
I love you, sweetie.

48:02.980 --> 48:04.504
There you go, bunny rabbit.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.106
Come on, come on.

48:06.184 --> 48:07.845
Open up, now.

48:07.919 --> 48:10.080
I want you to be around for a while,
you understand?

48:10.154 --> 48:12.714
We don't want you checkin' out
right this--

48:12.790 --> 48:15.520
God...damn.

48:16.427 --> 48:17.519
Ramona.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.995
You been fartin' like a goddamn
pack mule since I met--

48:22.066 --> 48:23.055
God damn!

48:23.134 --> 48:24.761
I hate to do this to you Earl.

48:24.835 --> 48:27.303
but we need evey man on the job!

48:27.371 --> 48:28.963
The shit has hit the fan!

48:29.040 --> 48:32.134
Bring some guns...and ammo!

48:32.210 --> 48:34.075
Meet me at my brother's!

48:34.145 --> 48:35.612
I gotcha. I'll be there.

48:37.648 --> 48:39.115
Gotta eat quick, sweetie.

48:39.183 --> 48:40.309
Come on.

48:42.186 --> 48:43.915
Ramona.

48:46.390 --> 48:47.482
Ramona.

48:50.861 --> 48:51.850
Aah!

49:24.762 --> 49:25.421
Uhh!

49:25.496 --> 49:28.954
Aaaah!

49:29.033 --> 49:30.660
Oh, my God.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.019
What the hell is goin' on?

50:32.530 --> 50:34.361
Are you gonna give me a gun?

50:34.432 --> 50:36.195
Are you fucking kidding me?

50:57.488 --> 50:58.785
Fuck.

51:01.592 --> 51:03.457
Oh! Fuck me!

51:03.527 --> 51:04.926
God damn it!

51:04.995 --> 51:07.725
Let's sort this shit out, boys!

51:11.702 --> 51:13.135
Dumbass.

51:14.238 --> 51:15.227
Yeah.

51:15.373 --> 51:17.773
Not today! Not today!

51:17.842 --> 51:20.140
Fucking Wednesday nights!

51:21.545 --> 51:23.706
Aaah!

51:56.947 --> 51:58.141
Uhh!

52:19.503 --> 52:20.834
Palomita?

52:24.642 --> 52:26.507
Get up. We're leaving.

52:26.577 --> 52:28.010
I can't walk.

52:28.078 --> 52:30.205
So what? Get up!

52:30.281 --> 52:31.373
- Get--
- Aah!

52:31.449 --> 52:32.541
Uhh!

52:33.350 --> 52:35.409
Motherfucker.

52:35.486 --> 52:37.113
Look at me!

52:37.188 --> 52:38.382
Look at me!

52:39.757 --> 52:42.157
I was gonna be a standup comedian.

52:42.226 --> 52:43.853
But who's gonna laugh now?

52:43.928 --> 52:45.793
Some of their best jokes
are about cripples.

52:45.863 --> 52:46.955
Let's go.

52:47.031 --> 52:48.658
It's not funny. It's ppathetic.

52:48.732 --> 52:50.199
Would you stop cryin' over fuckin'...

52:50.267 --> 52:51.427
spilled milk?

52:51.502 --> 52:53.663
I have no leg!

53:02.746 --> 53:05.112
Now you do.
What do you think?

53:09.687 --> 53:11.985
You could carry me, Wray.

53:12.056 --> 53:14.286
Yeah? You never wanted that before.

53:15.059 --> 53:16.287
Why start now?

53:19.830 --> 53:20.819
Alh-ah!

53:22.700 --> 53:23.428
Uhh!

53:23.501 --> 53:25.594
Alhh!

53:25.669 --> 53:26.727
Uhh!

53:29.406 --> 53:31.499
This is fucking ridiculous.

53:36.747 --> 53:38.738
The sheriff must've
taken the others to J.T's.

53:38.816 --> 53:39.908
Get in.

53:46.357 --> 53:48.382
God damn it, wait for me.

53:59.203 --> 54:01.763
My leg's stuck in the door!

54:01.839 --> 54:03.773
- It's just wood.
- It's splintering.

54:03.841 --> 54:05.604
Will you just leave it alone?

54:05.676 --> 54:07.109
Why is this happening to me?

54:07.177 --> 54:10.078
I don't know. Just--
just do me a favor right now and just...

54:10.147 --> 54:11.944
stay strong.

54:13.284 --> 54:14.717
"Stay"?

54:15.786 --> 54:18.254
Yeah, baby. Stay.

54:20.057 --> 54:22.048
Okay, my name is Electra.

54:22.126 --> 54:23.320
Fucking listen.

54:23.394 --> 54:25.021
My name is Electra.
Her name is Electra, too.

54:27.565 --> 54:29.192
It's furry.

54:30.868 --> 54:32.165
No.

54:32.236 --> 54:33.931
He's a furry one.

54:34.004 --> 54:36.438
She goes by Lia, I go by El.
El from "Electra", Ame from "Amelia".

54:36.507 --> 54:38.600
Does that make
any fucking sense in your head?

54:40.811 --> 54:43.279
You can call me whatever the fuck
you want--I don't give a shit.

54:51.989 --> 54:53.456
Oye. chica.

54:53.524 --> 54:55.219
- You said 10:00!
- I'm sorry.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.453
We can't be watching your kid
all goddamn night!

54:57.528 --> 55:00.019
Your friend never showed up,
and we got shit to do!

55:00.097 --> 55:01.621
That's right.

55:01.699 --> 55:03.667
Then start doing it.

55:05.169 --> 55:06.397
Oh!

55:07.438 --> 55:09.133
Uhh!

55:10.307 --> 55:12.707
Tony! We're leaving!

55:14.244 --> 55:15.939
Wait, my tarantula.

55:16.013 --> 55:17.878
Bring it. Let's go.

55:17.948 --> 55:19.313
And my turtle.

55:20.084 --> 55:21.108
And my scorppion.

55:21.185 --> 55:24.484
We're not all octopuses.
We can't carry everything.

55:24.555 --> 55:25.988
"Octopi."

55:26.056 --> 55:28.991
Ohh...come on, let's go.

55:35.099 --> 55:36.726
Tony, what did I tell you?

55:36.800 --> 55:39.530
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

55:39.603 --> 55:42.071
It's okay. They can live
in the same tank.

55:42.139 --> 55:44.699
What about my pocket bike?

55:44.775 --> 55:46.072
It's in the trunk.

55:46.143 --> 55:47.542
Aah!

55:47.611 --> 55:49.909
Where do you think you're going,
you fucking bitch?!

55:52.616 --> 55:54.140
We're gonna fuckin' kill you!

56:11.035 --> 56:13.060
Are you sure you want to do this?

56:15.539 --> 56:17.200
Everybody grab a badge and a gun.

56:17.274 --> 56:20.675
You're all deputies
as of this moment foitward.

56:20.744 --> 56:22.336
Except for you, Wray.

56:31.055 --> 56:32.181
Yo.

56:33.290 --> 56:34.621
What do we got?

56:34.692 --> 56:36.455
Something's wrong up there.

56:37.261 --> 56:39.661
J.T. always comes out and greets.

56:39.730 --> 56:40.822
Let's go.

56:43.100 --> 56:45.034
Try not to shoot yourselves.

56:46.837 --> 56:48.031
Don't shoot each other.

56:49.273 --> 56:50.604
But especially...

56:53.177 --> 56:54.542
don't shoot me.

57:01.719 --> 57:03.118
J.T.?

57:10.861 --> 57:12.692
Go on! Get off him, Rusty!

57:17.935 --> 57:19.698
God damn, J.T.

57:21.205 --> 57:22.194
Yah!

57:32.416 --> 57:33.610
Barbecue?

57:34.685 --> 57:36.016
Asshole.

57:38.055 --> 57:40.455
Damn good sausage link, J.T.

57:40.524 --> 57:42.253
Best in Texas.

57:42.326 --> 57:44.487
Must've passed out
after I killed those things.

57:46.530 --> 57:47.554
Nice shootin'.

57:47.631 --> 57:49.929
Everybody gather up supplies.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.558
We head out in 20!

57:55.706 --> 57:56.764
I think I nailed it.

57:56.840 --> 57:58.899
Holy shit, I think I finally cracked it.

57:58.976 --> 58:02.309
I finally found my--
my award-winning barbecue sauce!

58:03.480 --> 58:05.380
Your blood's in it.

58:09.586 --> 58:11.486
God damn it, he's right.

58:29.206 --> 58:30.935
Hey, my other tooth fell out.

58:32.476 --> 58:33.773
Heh.

58:35.379 --> 58:36.903
It sure did.

58:37.748 --> 58:39.943
Hey, your tooth fell out, too.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.884
We're toothless buddies.

58:45.956 --> 58:48.390
Oh, we sure are.

58:55.933 --> 58:58.367
I want you to open that for Mommy.

59:01.939 --> 59:03.998
Now, take the gun.

59:05.175 --> 59:07.040
Careful.

59:07.110 --> 59:10.944
And if anyone comes to the door
that isn't me,

59:11.014 --> 59:13.039
I want you to shoot them, okay?

59:13.116 --> 59:15.141
I'm not kidding, Tony.

59:15.219 --> 59:16.880
You shoot them...

59:16.954 --> 59:18.979
just like your video games.

59:19.056 --> 59:21.991
You shoot them in the head.

59:22.059 --> 59:23.924
What if it's Dad?

59:23.994 --> 59:27.020
Especially if it's your dad.

59:39.309 --> 59:41.709
And be careful
where you point that thing.

59:41.778 --> 59:43.143
You'll blow your own face off.

59:43.213 --> 59:45.010
I'll be right back.

59:45.115 --> 59:47.811
I love you.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:09.594
Tony!

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:13.367
Aah!

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:14.774
Hello, baby.

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:19.608
Ohh!

01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:33.128
I'm gonna eat your brains...

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:36.528
and gain your knowledge.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.396
Stay away!

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:45.105
Look what you did to our son!

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:53.878
Stay away!

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.350
God damn it, I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.394
Daddy!

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:08.724
Get your sorry ass in here!

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:09.788
Aah!

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:15.396
If it's escape vehicles you want,
escape vehicles I got.

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:16.769
Right this way.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:18.936
Watch that meat.

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.407
Meet my wife.

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.236
Jesse James Custom Dominator.

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.714
I made Jesse a pplate of barbecue
so goddamn good,

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:29.217
he made this baby for me
free of fuckin' charge. Heh heh heh.

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:31.311
Got anything that could
transpport more peopple?

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.080
Where's the top?

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.388
This baby's chopped permanent.

01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:39.486
Ain't got no roll bar, chicken wire,
none of that shit.

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:41.496
- No protection.
- But she's fast.

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:44.534
Nitrous-injected,
350-horsepower engine.

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:46.432
Who are you?

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:47.561
I mean, really.

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:49.866
Wray's Wreckage.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.931
That's what it says on your truck.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:58.972
Are you a wrecker, Wray?

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.879
I'm nobody.

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:04.283
It's the easiest thing to remember.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:06.651
So remember it.

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:12.086
Just stack 'em
on top of the counter.

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.025
Hey, you want some barbecue?

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:18.226
Heh heh heh. Best in Texas.

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:19.825
Aw, no, thanks.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.495
What's the matter,
you don't eat meat?

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.232
Oh, I eat meat.

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:25.740
I also eat lots of shit.

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:27.606
You see this?

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:28.871
What's that?

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.242
Shit-eating grin.

01:02:31.615 --> 01:02:33.776
You ought to be a comedian.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.249
What do you think of the leg?

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:37.548
Oh, that's funny.

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.646
How's your stump?

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:42.589
They knocked it out something fierce.

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:43.819
Still can't feel a thing.

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:48.127
This must be the real Bone Shack.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.528
Old J.T. knows how to live.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:55.002
Like fuck he does.

01:02:57.908 --> 01:02:59.773
I like how you say "fuck".

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:01.902
Good. Fuck you.

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.176
Fuck me?

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:10.546
Oh, so, now you're the comedian.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.850
Go ahead, drop your pants.

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:15.084
That'll be good for a laugh.

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:17.558
I highly doubt that.

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:25.692
That's my jacket.

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:27.703
Yes, I know.

01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:29.739
I looked for it for two weeks.

01:03:30.674 --> 01:03:34.633
Look, you were being
an unbelievable dick::.

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.941
I was walking out on you.

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:40.346
I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:44.114
So, if you're gonna go on one of your
psycho obsessive controlling rants

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:46.121
about a fucking jacket,
then fucking take it,

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:49.420
'cause I'd rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.424
Did you find what was in the pock:et?

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.158
Fuck no.

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:56.597
Look for it.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.335
No, the other one.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.513
I was gonna give it to you,
but you left me.

01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:16.710
You took the jacket.

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:21.153
And I looked for it for two weeks.

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.517
Read it.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.165
"Two against the world."

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:37.270
Remember that?

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:40.500
I never forgot it.

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:43.935
Then why'd you leave?

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.445
Because you didn't believe in us,

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:48.916
or in me.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.635
I figured one of them new deputies
might end up shootin' me,

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.330
but not you, Tolo!

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:16.895
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:18.872
- Dumbass.
- You're gonna be all right.

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:20.432
- McGraw's here.
-  Now, now, now.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.637
- And a whole bunch of others.
- Everybody in!

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:23.701
Come on!

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.270
Over here.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:26.974
Move your ass! Come on!

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:47.066
What did I tell you, Tony?

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:50.504
Don't point the gun at yourself.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:53.276
Didn't I tell you that?

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.906
Thank you for telling me about...

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.038
you know.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.979
Don't mention it.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:01.881
That's an order.

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:03.646
If I had known that you were...

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.148
El Wray...

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:10.488
I wouldn't have given you
such a hard time.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.187
I didn't mean to be a prick about it.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.754
Need-to-know basis, that kind of shit.

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:17.163
Take this.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:20.994
Do what you do best.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:25.173
No, you're not!

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:26.640
Don't give him the gun. Not--

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:28.233
Give him the gun, Tolo.

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:31.905
Give him the gun.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.641
Give him all the guns.

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:49.865
Holy shit.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.327
That boy's got the devil in him.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:58.631
We gotta fight them off.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.043
Get to our vehicles.

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:04.105
Everyone behind me!

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.948
Outside now!

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.104
God damn you!

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.425
Everybody back inside!

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.026
You, Skip.

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:01.069
Front and center.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:04.868
You go out front,
start up the Kill Dozer.

01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:07.068
We'll need it to transport
the other survivors.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.577
You fuckin' crazy?
I'm not goin' out there.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:12.078
- I'll cover you.
- I'm not goin'.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.581
I never miss.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.618
Come on, Skipp.

01:09:15.685 --> 01:09:17.550
It's go-go.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.520
Not cry-cry.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.613
Cherry!

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:33.426
Oh, dear.

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:42.505
Alh!

01:09:59.095 --> 01:10:00.084
Aah!

01:10:21.017 --> 01:10:22.143
J.T.!

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.015
You take whoever you can fit
in your convertible.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.178
Everyone else on board!

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:26.847
Skipp, grab the ttwins!
Come along with me!

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:29.186
You take the chopper.

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:30.886
I need someone else
to drive my truck!

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.291
I'll do it.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.357
You're bleedin' like a stuck pig.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.525
Your vision's blurred
and you're on your last legs.

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:39.898
Anything else?

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:41.493
Don't wreck it.

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.405
Somebody grab the slaw!

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:46.339
You can't have no barbecue
without coleslaw!

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.967
- Give me a gun.
- Take this.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.206
Fucking cool!

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:54.240
All right, y'all, head out.
I'll hold 'em off.

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:58.245
I can take care of myself.

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:00.515
Bye, Daddy.

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:03.782
Do you remember how to ride a bike?

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.623
Useless talent number 32.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:07.954
Good.

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:09.760
Anyone else have a car?

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.702
Now, you're sure you're okay
driving this thing?

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.104
Hell yeah.

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:23.704
Dakota...
we're sorry about Tony.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.606
Thanks.

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:29.207
Your engine is shot
and you've got three blown tires.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.276
But I've got his ppocket bike
in the trunk.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.521
Is it fast?

01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:36.582
Zero to fifty in four seconds.

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.593
You ride with her.

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:41.357
I'm Cherry.

01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:42.955
You sure are.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.761
Move out!

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:47.859
Damn shame.

01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:22.794
Rusty!

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.736
Aah!

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:26.240
God damn it!

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:27.298
Aah!

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.546
Sheriff! How much ammo we got?

01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:09.951
Not enough.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:25.231
Don't shoot!
We're not infected!

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:36.939
All survivors gotta come with us.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.641
Especially you...

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.646
El Wray.

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:45.153
I don't go by that name anymore.

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:01.665
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:05.934
We're here in quarantine
with the other survivors.

01:14:16.219 --> 01:14:17.481
Where is here?

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:20.383
The old army base.

01:14:21.324 --> 01:14:23.224
El Wray?

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:26.191
That you?

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:30.188
He's with them.
I saw him in their convoy earlier.

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:32.029
I'm a scientist...

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:34.535
and a businessman.
Not military.

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:38.301
Which is why he's gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:42.104
They're stealing biochemical weapons.

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.473
DC-2?

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:45.912
Also known as "Project Terror."

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:50.015
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled landlocked area.

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:52.054
You were supplying it to them.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.382
- That's why they shut you out.
- They found my supply.

01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:58.427
It's under our feet.

01:14:58.528 --> 01:15:00.428
Ten stories down.

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:02.930
What about countering
with atropine and PAM-2?

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:06.867
Interferes with the neurotoxic delivery,
sets off the cell-blaster,

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:10.394
and you're gushing blood and pus
through every sacred hole in your body.

01:15:10.473 --> 01:15:11.906
Apetizing.

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:15.603
The only treatment
is a regimented exposure to DC-2 itself.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.236
It delays the negative effects.

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:18.780
They need it...

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:21.110
Iike a drug.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.744
Correct. But we found that
a small percentage of people

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.981
are not affected by the gas itself,

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:28.580
and within this small percentage
lies a cure.

01:15:28.658 --> 01:15:30.285
What do you want to do?

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:34.957
Mexico.

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:36.827
Put our backs against the ocean

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:38.491
and defend ourselves from there.

01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:40.432
No. We have to get back to my lab.

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:42.494
This infection will sppread
all over the world,

01:15:42.572 --> 01:15:44.563
to every man, woman and child,

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.198
unless I finish my antidote.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:48.936
You have an antidote?

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:58.586
You! You!

01:15:58.654 --> 01:15:59.552
Come with us.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:01.881
Move it!

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.123
Move it, Peggy!

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:08.461
Uhh!

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:23.472
Do you like Ava Gardner?

01:16:24.647 --> 01:16:25.807
I'm sorry?

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:32.310
Ava Gardner.
Do you like her?

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.389
Yeah, I guess.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.318
I was just thinking that you, uh...

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:40.419
kind of look like Ava Gardner
a little bit.

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:50.395
You got something
you want to say to me?

01:16:51.674 --> 01:16:53.437
I have nothing to say to you.

01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:55.409
You got nothing to say, huh?
That's funny.

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:58.504
'Cause I could've swore you just
gave me a "fuck you" look right now.

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:00.906
You want to say "fuck you" to me?

01:17:01.584 --> 01:17:03.142
Not at this moment.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.379
You know what this is?

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:10.449
A gun.

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:12.619
It's simplicity itself.

01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:15.621
You see, you point it
at what you want to die...

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.556
and you pull the little trigger here...

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:21.700
and a little bullet comes out of here.

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:25.036
And the little bullet
hits you right there.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.336
And you know what?

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:31.102
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:38.712
Don't taunt me, tramp.

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:42.087
I am not one to be taunted.

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:43.283
You got it?

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:48.389
Let me here you say, "l got it."

01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:50.796
I got it.

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:52.731
You damn well better.

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:02.042
Tool.

01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:09.348
God damn it, that's it.

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:11.914
I figured it out.

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:14.351
Salt.

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:15.890
Got it all figured out. It's salt.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:17.448
Blood is salty.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.960
That's all my sauce needed,
was just a little more salt.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.125
It just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talkin' about?

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:24.324
What are you doing, J.T.?

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.334
That's all I gotta do,
is put a little more salt in.

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.733
It'd just do the same goddamn thing
that the blood did.

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:31.204
I tell you what, brother,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:33.173
Don't do nothin' stuppid, J.T.
I got it covered.

01:18:33.242 --> 01:18:36.211
It's already got my sweat, it's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood!

01:18:39.982 --> 01:18:41.279
- Dropp the gun!
- J.T.!

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:44.475
- Do it now!
- Okay, okay!

01:18:44.587 --> 01:18:45.952
Don't shoot!

01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:47.182
J.T., you all right?

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:49.686
Uhh!

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:58.323
Hey, you all right, bro?

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:00.265
God damn it,
I'm not all right at all, brother.

01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:01.769
Not at all.

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.464
Wait here.

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:05.700
Oh...I sure will.

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:09.778
Goddamn sauce.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:20.319
"Women in Cages".

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:22.186
See them in action.

01:19:23.659 --> 01:19:25.524
See them in love.

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:28.062
See them in terror.

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:30.690
White skin on the black market.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.963
Soft flesh for hard cash.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:36.095
"Women in Cages. "

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:38.299
I'm gonna go get my dick wet.

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:40.569
She's got one leg.

01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:42.304
Easier access.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:45.744
You got a point.

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:55.555
Get the rest of this shit uppstairs
and we'll blow this entire floor.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:56.613
Yes, sir.

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:12.136
Get Lewis down here.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.735
He's getting his dick wet, sir.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.972
Get him the fuck down here now!

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:29.788
Lewis?

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:30.917
Wilson?

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:48.035
Where are my men?

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:50.203
I've got several right here.

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:53.980
What the fuck's this?

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:56.278
Their balls, sweetheart.

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:02.253
I'm walking out of here
with this shit, Wray.

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:04.554
- Let us go.
- Tell me why we should.

01:21:04.627 --> 01:21:05.651
Because I earned it.

01:21:05.761 --> 01:21:07.285
How do you figure that?

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:10.662
You want the story?
I'll spin it for you quick.

01:21:10.733 --> 01:21:13.600
A termite's nest of caves
on the Afghan border,

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:16.797
me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:20.603
and our balls in our throats,
lookin' for America's most wanted.

01:21:20.676 --> 01:21:22.166
- Bin Laden.
- Yeah.

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:24.371
For once, our intel
was right on the money.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:25.674
I come around a corner--

01:21:25.748 --> 01:21:27.682
bam, there he is,
lookin' me right in the eyes.

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:28.876
Wait.

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:30.919
You killed bin Laden?

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:34.353
I put two in his heart,
one in his computer.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:36.447
So that was you.

01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:37.822
Yeah.

01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:39.991
That was me.

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.121
Class-A clusterfuck.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.499
He wasn't supposed to be there,
we weren't supposed to be there,

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:51.404
and I sure as fuck wasn't supposed to be
the one to punch his dialysis ticket.

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:55.375
So, instead of a chest full of medals,
we get a face full of DC-2.

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:57.604
No cure.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.114
That is, not until we found
somebody from the other side

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:02.207
willing to sell us batches of this shit.

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:05.549
Science comes first, but business
comes a close fucking second.

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:09.113
Then you realized if you could
infect a large enough populace,

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:12.319
the experiment and its survivors,

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.055
you'd find a cure.

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:16.825
I swore to my men
that I'd do everything in my power

01:22:16.899 --> 01:22:18.389
to keepp them alive.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.627
And that's what I intend to do, Wray.

01:22:22.838 --> 01:22:24.169
Understand?

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:28.040
I never had a choice.

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:32.445
Neither do l, sir.

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:37.285
God bless you
and your service to this country.

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.356
You're a doctor?

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:47.153
Heh.

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.995
I was earlier tonight.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:54.131
I always wanted to be a doctor.

01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:57.434
Instead, I can do...

01:22:57.506 --> 01:22:58.905
this.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:02.842
Ohh. Useless talent number 66.

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:08.144
I'm very pliable.

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:09.844
A girlfriend of mine
had a theory.

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:13.354
She said at some point in your life,

01:23:13.422 --> 01:23:16.619
you find a use for every useless talent
you ever had.

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.652
It's like, uh, connecting the dots.

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:22.060
I'm not that optimistic.

01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:25.692
I feel like I'm sinking down the drain
and I can't get out.

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:27.030
She'd say...

01:23:27.903 --> 01:23:29.871
when you're stuck in that spiral...

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:32.238
you reach up.

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:35.943
What if there's nothing up there?

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.574
Just reach up.

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:41.644
You're a dancer.

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:44.218
I was earlier tonight.

01:23:44.286 --> 01:23:46.880
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement!

01:23:49.558 --> 01:23:51.685
Get your ass up!

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:57.087
Now, I'm starved for entertainment, baby,
and that means you.

01:23:57.166 --> 01:23:58.155
Radio!

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:02.893
Wail, baby, now!

01:24:07.343 --> 01:24:09.243
' to a pay...

01:24:09.311 --> 01:24:10.300
That's--

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:13.210
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:15.444
Dance it up.

01:24:17.086 --> 01:24:18.553
Keep dancing!

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:20.983
'Cause now. I'm jaded...

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:24.787
I have seen me
some crazy ass shit in my day...

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:29.196
but ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:31.994
I have seen me a stripper
with one breast,

01:24:32.101 --> 01:24:35.036
and I've seen me a stripper
with 12 toes,

01:24:35.137 --> 01:24:37.628
and I've seen me a stripper
with no brains at all,

01:24:37.706 --> 01:24:40.834
but I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.843
And I've been to Morocco.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.675
Dance, bitch!

01:24:47.483 --> 01:24:49.246
Break a leg!

01:24:50.319 --> 01:24:52.378
Break it off! Ha ha!

01:25:01.797 --> 01:25:04.027
Dance for me, motherfucker.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.964
- Uhh!
- Aaaaah!

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:06.728
Aah!

01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:09.498
Ohhhh!

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:20.207
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:22.806
Actually, yes.

01:25:22.885 --> 01:25:24.853
You gave me some wood,

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.911
now I'm gonna give you...

01:25:26.989 --> 01:25:30.015
some fuckin' wood!

01:25:30.092 --> 01:25:32.060
Alh--ah!

01:25:39.535 --> 01:25:42.504
Alhh!

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:45.096
The gas! You need your gas!

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:47.233
No! Fuck the gas, fuck it.

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:49.743
I'm just gonna have to make this quick.

01:26:01.123 --> 01:26:02.454
Aah!

01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:03.752
Uhh!

01:26:03.859 --> 01:26:05.759
Where'd you get that?

01:26:05.861 --> 01:26:07.988
Useless talent number 37.

01:26:09.431 --> 01:26:11.126
Aaaaah!

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:32.743
Uhh! Uhh!

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:36.152
I broke my leg.

01:26:36.225 --> 01:26:38.955
That's okay.
I made you something.

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:43.823
I do believe in you.

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.065
Always have.

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:48.728
I believe that you could be better.

01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:51.102
You deserve better,

01:26:51.173 --> 01:26:52.834
even better than me.

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:54.937
Right now,

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.944
I need you to become...

01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.107
who you're meant to be.

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:02.210
Stand.

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:10.121
I'd stand clear if I were you.

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:18.592
Oppen that door, will you, baby?

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.045
Uhh!

01:27:46.795 --> 01:27:48.922
They've destroyed most of the tanks.

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:52.291
Any that are left
we'll get on our way to the helicoppters.

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:54.597
There are two helicopters,

01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:56.695
big enough to take all of us.

01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:59.266
Who can fly?

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:04.811
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.472
I can fly, but...

01:28:06.548 --> 01:28:08.516
no way in hell I'm gonna fly tonight.

01:28:08.584 --> 01:28:10.381
Okay. Cool.

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:11.713
I'll fly.

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.215
Let's go.

01:28:20.362 --> 01:28:22.159
I think we're gonna stay here, Wray.

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:25.094
You'll take care of this for me,
then, Sheriff?

01:28:26.368 --> 01:28:28.029
With pleasure.

01:28:28.103 --> 01:28:29.365
Three minutes.

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:32.466
Your brother's a good man, J.T.

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:34.133
Best in Texas.

01:28:37.379 --> 01:28:38.505
Hop on.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.182
No, the other way.

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.548
Oh.

01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:49.749
No. The other way.

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:39.372
The helicopters are
on the other side of this wall.

01:29:46.348 --> 01:29:47.610
We make a run for it!

01:29:47.683 --> 01:29:50.846
No! If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.180
Don't you get it?

01:29:52.287 --> 01:29:54.778
We're the antidote.

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.346
Well, is there another way around?

01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:58.358
Wait here.

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:28.420
I don't suppose there are any other
biochemical engineers around? Heh.

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:30.151
Take that as a no.

01:30:32.127 --> 01:30:33.754
We have to get over that wall!

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:40.334
I was thinkin' we could build us
a new place,

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:42.529
right there where the old one was.

01:30:43.405 --> 01:30:44.963
You cook,

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.667
I work the back.

01:30:47.976 --> 01:30:51.241
You don't make that rent
so goddamn high.

01:30:51.313 --> 01:30:54.646
We share the recippe,
we share the rent.

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:02.086
Start at 250 degrees.

01:31:05.327 --> 01:31:06.817
I knew it.

01:31:06.895 --> 01:31:08.362
For how long?

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:10.830
- 12 pounds?
- Sure.

01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:13.094
12 pounds, 12 hours.

01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:15.260
Wrapped in tin foil, right?

01:31:15.337 --> 01:31:17.464
I don't use no goddamn foil.

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:18.563
Damn.

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:20.903
Tomatoes? Fresh?

01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:23.309
Canned.

01:31:23.378 --> 01:31:25.039
- No shit?
- Yeah.

01:31:25.113 --> 01:31:26.341
You score me some?

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:27.938
Oh, yeah.

01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:30.017
'Cause we're brothers.

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:33.847
Thank you for this.

01:31:33.922 --> 01:31:35.480
You just remember...

01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:38.458
you got to take this recipe
to your grave.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.724
I think I can...
goddamn guarantee that.

01:32:07.656 --> 01:32:09.248
That's our cue.

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:13.287
Cherry, darling...

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:16.529
it's all you.

01:32:47.863 --> 01:32:49.125
Let's go!

01:33:54.396 --> 01:33:56.091
Aah!

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:58.258
Wray!

01:34:01.436 --> 01:34:03.131
Damn it, Wray.

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:04.432
Ohh.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:08.734
Okay. You need to get up
'cause we're leaving.

01:34:33.335 --> 01:34:35.735
They told me I'd find you here.

01:34:39.074 --> 01:34:41.975
I was beginning to lose hope.

01:34:42.077 --> 01:34:43.840
I'm sorry...

01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.641
but I lied.

01:34:49.084 --> 01:34:52.679
I did want to hurt you.

01:34:54.322 --> 01:34:56.187
My turn.

01:35:06.601 --> 01:35:10.298
No more dead bodies
for Daddy tonight.

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:14.364
Never did like that son of a bitch.

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:20.444
About as useless
as a pecker on a pope.

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:27.814
Don't touch anything.

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:29.184
I want to fly it.

01:35:29.257 --> 01:35:31.487
- He said not to touch anything!
- You don't know what you're doing!

01:35:31.593 --> 01:35:32.787
- I do know what I'm doing!
- No, you don't!

01:35:32.861 --> 01:35:35.125
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up, sit down...

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:36.993
and don't fuckin' touch anything!

01:35:43.505 --> 01:35:44.631
Everybody sit down!

01:35:51.513 --> 01:35:53.003
Whoo!

01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:02.414
Hit the wipers.

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:09.753
Go on, leave me.

01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:12.493
I am not leaving you here like this.

01:36:12.567 --> 01:36:15.468
Motherfuckers around here
eat road kill.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:19.934
See? I'm funny.

01:36:20.675 --> 01:36:22.302
I made you laugh.

01:36:22.377 --> 01:36:23.537
Go to the ocean.

01:36:23.645 --> 01:36:26.671
Put your bacs to it.
Protect yourselves there.

01:36:26.748 --> 01:36:29.444
I'm not leaving you, Wray.

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.813
It's two against the world.

01:36:34.089 --> 01:36:35.681
It will be.

01:36:37.192 --> 01:36:38.591
I promise.

01:36:39.427 --> 01:36:41.224
I never miss.

01:36:42.664 --> 01:36:44.461
Don't worry, baby.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.368
You'll find your way.

01:37:02.417 --> 01:37:05.875
Reach up!

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:20.165
Reach up!

01:38:06.548 --> 01:38:08.914
It's like you said
it would be, Wray.

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:13.579
I'm like you said I would be.

01:38:13.655 --> 01:38:15.316
I find the lost...

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:17.588
the weary...

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:20.884
those that have no hoppe.

01:38:20.962 --> 01:38:23.954
I find them and I lead them...

01:38:24.966 --> 01:38:27.457
to a land we've made for ourselves.

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:30.804
The land by the sea.

01:39:05.173 --> 01:39:06.936
It's beautiful.

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:10.342
She's beautiful.

01:39:12.347 --> 01:39:15.976
I wish you could see us, us two.

01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:18.816
It's like you said it would be.

01:39:20.088 --> 01:39:22.113
Two against the world, baby.

01:39:23.024 --> 01:39:24.821
Two against the world.
