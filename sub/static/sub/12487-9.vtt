- ♪

00:04.780 --> 00:08.290
- Yeah, well, I hope you jokers
learned your lesson.

00:08.390 --> 00:11.720
You disrupt my practise,
you run extra laps.

00:11.820 --> 00:13.050
- But, Coach,
we weren't trying to--

00:13.160 --> 00:16.160
- Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
No time for excuses, Dawson.

00:16.260 --> 00:18.130
Rain's coming.
I don't want to be late.

00:18.230 --> 00:22.130
I've got a hot date with
a spicy little dish.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.390
Chicken tamales,
it's you and me.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.610
- Thanks a lot, guys.

00:27.710 --> 00:29.240
- Because y'all wouldn't stop
making me laugh during drills,

00:29.340 --> 00:31.710
I'm going to be late for
Pepper's birthday party.

00:31.810 --> 00:33.480
- Don't blame us, blame Newt.

00:33.580 --> 00:35.950
- Yeah, when his pads squeak,
they sound just like--

00:40.080 --> 00:42.710
Who did that?

00:46.160 --> 00:47.730
Oh...

00:47.830 --> 00:49.330
Oh, Bella!
- We are so late.

00:49.430 --> 00:50.930
We're the only people
left in the school.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.030
- And my party started
45 minutes ago.

00:53.130 --> 00:54.800
If we leave now, we'll
be fashionably late--

00:54.900 --> 00:56.870
as opposed to
obnoxiously late.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.730
- Oh, man, is that
what I think it is?

01:00.840 --> 01:02.510
- Yep, it's a tornado warning.

01:02.610 --> 01:05.780
- Tornado? You mean a twister?
A cyclone?

01:05.880 --> 01:08.510
Nature's one-way toilet bowl
that flushes you to your doom?

01:08.610 --> 01:11.870
- Relax, Newt.
It's probably just a test.

01:14.790 --> 01:16.920
This is not a test!

01:17.020 --> 01:19.020
Silverado is on Tornado Alert!

01:19.120 --> 01:21.880
You know what this means.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.750
- Total boredom.

01:23.860 --> 01:26.000
Sorry, folks, you're stuck
inside, waiting for a twister

01:26.100 --> 01:28.300
that will probably
never materialize.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.270
Looks like I'll be spending
the next three hours

01:30.370 --> 01:32.400
playing charades with
my cameraman Chauncy.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.560
Talk about your
"natural disasters."

01:37.140 --> 01:40.280
- Pepper, this is
the worst timing.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.410
- I spent the entire year
planning a beautiful,

01:42.510 --> 01:46.980
Paris-themed party
and now I'm stuck here.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.680
This is not how I envisioned
my 13th birthday.

01:51.390 --> 01:54.560
- You're worried about
a birthday party?

01:54.660 --> 01:57.430
We're all gonna die
and I've never been kissed.

01:57.530 --> 01:58.960
Sophie?

01:59.060 --> 02:00.890
- Let me think about it.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.600
No.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.240
- Well, at least now

02:46.480 --> 02:48.380
Tornados are one of
my biggest fears.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.380
I blame my stepmom
for showing me

02:50.480 --> 02:52.420
that horror movie--
"The Wizard of Oz."

02:52.520 --> 02:54.550
Way too realistic.

02:54.650 --> 02:57.060
- No need to panic.
I'm the 8th grade safety warden.

02:57.150 --> 02:58.310
I took a one-hour
training course,

02:58.420 --> 02:59.760
and once an airline trusted me

02:59.860 --> 03:01.560
to sit in the exit
row of a plane.

03:01.660 --> 03:03.600
- I thought you said you
threw up in the exit row?

03:03.690 --> 03:05.550
Listen up!

03:05.660 --> 03:07.390
According to safety procedure,

03:07.500 --> 03:09.430
the first thing we need to
do is call our parents.

03:09.530 --> 03:12.230
- Shhh, will you keep it down.
We're calling our parents.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.840
- Then you're following
procedure.

03:14.940 --> 03:16.940
- I understand, Dad.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.780
You already rented a place
and everyone's there.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.950
Just continue
the party without me.

03:23.050 --> 03:25.320
- You guys, I feel horrible.

03:25.420 --> 03:26.950
If I hadn't been late,

03:27.050 --> 03:28.990
Pepper would already be
at her fancy party.

03:29.090 --> 03:30.990
Maybe if we work together,
we can make it up to her.

03:31.090 --> 03:35.260
Look at Pepper. She's following
her own party on Clikpic.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.700
- Aw, the twinkle lights.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.130
And dad blowing out
the candles for me.

03:41.230 --> 03:44.900
As long as he didn't
open my presents.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.710
Come on, Dad!

03:47.810 --> 03:50.480
- All right, we'll help.
- Here's our plan.

03:50.570 --> 03:53.370
We'll throw Pepper a surprise
party in the Bulldogs' gym.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.280
Sophie, you can make the cake.

03:55.380 --> 03:57.180
- Um, actually, that's
my area of expertise.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.380
- Great. You can work together.
- I am not working with--

03:59.480 --> 04:01.410
- No, no, no, no--
- Way to be team players.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.320
Sawyer, can you
distract Pepper?

04:03.420 --> 04:05.260
- Pepper? I've barely
said three words to her.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.930
- That's the spirit! Okay.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.080
I'll deal with
the decorations and with--

04:11.160 --> 04:15.000
Chicken Little over there.

04:15.100 --> 04:18.140
- Okay, everyone knows the plan.
Set your alarms.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.600
We'll meet in the gym at 6:30.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.930
Whatever you do,
don't let Pepper find out.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.810
- Find out about what?

04:23.910 --> 04:25.510
- Uh, Sawyer?

04:25.610 --> 04:27.510
- Uh, that you're the new
deputy safety warden.

04:27.610 --> 04:31.380
You get to wear
this cool vest.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.880
- I'm not wearing this.

04:32.980 --> 04:36.110
Orange is the new blecch.

04:36.220 --> 04:39.620
- Oh, wait, the vest!
You're violating procedure!

04:44.260 --> 04:46.870
- Chauncy, let's suit up.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.330
It's storm-chasin' time.

04:50.430 --> 04:53.660
- What? It's dangerous
out there.

04:53.770 --> 04:58.040
- A-V Club is the most dangerous
club in school, kid.

04:58.140 --> 05:00.380
We've got a job to do.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.180
- I do need those two
extra credit points.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.850
- Grab your helmet.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.850
Your bicycle just
became our news van.

05:06.950 --> 05:10.890
- Well, it looks like we checked
everything off the safety list.

05:10.990 --> 05:13.590
Wow, I thought that would
take a lot longer.

05:13.690 --> 05:16.090
- Really? Because
it felt like forever.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.220
Are we done yet?
- Not yet.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.200
Fortunately, we still
have to check

05:21.300 --> 05:23.400
the structural integrity
of the...

05:23.500 --> 05:26.070
integral structures--
which are this way.

05:26.170 --> 05:28.940
I mean, this way.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.280
- Oooh, in the boys'
locker room?

05:31.380 --> 05:33.180
Now it gets interesting.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.680
- Yeah, in there.

05:34.780 --> 05:43.320
- ♪

05:43.420 --> 05:45.590
- All right. Here's the plan.

05:45.690 --> 05:48.490
We're making my Abuela's
Tres Leches con Caramelo cake

05:48.590 --> 05:50.830
It's perfect every time--

05:50.930 --> 05:54.400
starting with exactly one
teaspoon of salt.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.270
- Okay, uh, better plan.

06:01.370 --> 06:03.940
We make my Chocolate
Surprise Supreme Cake.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.140
The surprise is it never
comes out the same--

06:06.240 --> 06:08.200
'cause I make it up
as I go along.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.840
Oh!

06:18.290 --> 06:19.490
- Sounds like a recipe.

06:19.590 --> 06:20.890
For disaster.

06:20.990 --> 06:24.330
Look, Pepper's my best friend,
so I'm gonna make her cake.

06:24.430 --> 06:26.730
If you wanna help,
you can be my assistant.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.700
- Assistant?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.600
The Troy doesn't assist,
okay, he creates.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.900
With my dad gone and my mom
working all the time,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.030
I taught myself to cook using
whatever's in the fridge.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.340
- Well, in my house,
we follow Abuela's recipes.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.440
Once, I didn't,
and Abuela cursed me.

06:42.550 --> 06:44.380
For the next three days,
I had nightmares

06:44.480 --> 06:47.390
the Chupacabra was chasing me.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.020
- Chupacabra?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.990
Hey, that's my favorite
combo meal at Taco-2-Go.

06:52.090 --> 06:55.960
- No, it's a spiny,
goat-sucking monster!

06:56.060 --> 06:57.500
- Oh.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.900
Yeah, that makes more sense.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.730
- Can you just pass me
an egg so we can get started?

07:02.830 --> 07:04.760
- You know what?
I'll do you one better.

07:04.870 --> 07:06.970
Check it.

07:10.910 --> 07:14.210
That is what I call
"The Troy Technique."

07:14.310 --> 07:15.580
- Crack the eggs
however you want.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.450
Just make sure
you follow the recipe.

07:17.550 --> 07:18.950
If you don't,
I'll curse you

07:19.050 --> 07:22.120
and you'll have nightmares
about the Chupacabra, too.

07:25.060 --> 07:28.690
- This is...this is...

07:28.790 --> 07:31.700
not as interesting as
I thought it would be.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.700
- What? Oh. It's real
interesting.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.970
Look at all the cool
stuff we got in here.

07:37.070 --> 07:39.340
Never mind.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.640
- I'm sorry.
I can't stay here.

07:40.740 --> 07:42.870
- Wait, uh, the safety kit.

07:42.970 --> 07:46.740
That's something we should
thoroughly and slowly check.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.680
Okay.

07:51.780 --> 07:55.090
Big bandages--check.

07:55.190 --> 07:56.490
Medium bandages--check.

07:56.590 --> 07:59.390
Little tiny circle
bandages--check.

07:59.490 --> 08:01.560
- Bored--check.
Over this--check.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.860
Leaving--oh, check.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.160
- Wait!

08:05.260 --> 08:09.170
O-o-o-o-ouch!

08:09.270 --> 08:10.370
- What happened?

08:10.470 --> 08:12.300
- I shut the lid on my hand.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.260
You'd better wrap it.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.110
- Injured by the safety kit.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.540
Painful and ironic.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.280
- Actually, a little
known fact...

08:20.380 --> 08:21.550
safety kits are
the number one

08:21.650 --> 08:24.180
cause of injuries among
safety professionals.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.450
Number two is wrapping
gauze too tightly.

08:26.550 --> 08:28.890
You'd better start over.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.020
- I'm sure the Theater
Department

08:33.120 --> 08:35.020
won't mind us borrowing
these decorations, right?

08:35.130 --> 08:37.360
- Who cares? You would not
believe what I'm reading

08:37.460 --> 08:40.330
on tornadoafraido.com.

08:40.429 --> 08:41.799
- You need to relax.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.900
Everything's going to be fine.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.540
- I just wish I was at home
with my lucky rabbit's foot.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.680
I keep it in
my lucky panic room.

08:50.770 --> 08:53.600
- Well, I have something
that might help.

08:53.710 --> 08:56.280
My dad gave me this locket
and it makes me feel safe.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.250
Just like he did.

08:58.350 --> 09:01.090
Right now, I think you
need it more than I do.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.690
- I don't know.
It's a little girly.

09:04.050 --> 09:06.080
- I'll keep an eye
on it for you.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.330
We can use these to make
it look more like Paris.

09:11.430 --> 09:12.700
All we need to do
is hang them.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.400
- Up there?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.100
Are you crazy?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.670
- Good thing I rock
this rope in gym class.

09:20.770 --> 09:23.840
- Oh, not me.
I also have a fear of heights.

09:23.940 --> 09:25.840
Whenever I'm supposed
to climb this,

09:25.940 --> 09:27.800
I fake a stomach ache,
lick my hands,

09:27.910 --> 09:30.280
and tell the teacher I have
a "sweaty palm condition."

09:30.380 --> 09:31.520
It works every time.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.420
Wanna feel?

09:33.520 --> 09:35.620
- I'll pass.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.930
- All right, let's see
how this tastes.

09:41.030 --> 09:44.460
What did you do
to my Abuela's cake?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.330
- Well, it needed
a proper flavor.

09:46.430 --> 09:48.430
So I improvised and added--

09:48.530 --> 09:50.540
whatever this is.

09:50.630 --> 09:52.890
- It's not the same.
You ruined it!

09:53.000 --> 09:55.560
- But just taste it
again, all right?

09:55.670 --> 09:57.870
It's delicious.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.280
- You wanna improvise?

10:03.380 --> 10:05.120
How's this?

10:06.850 --> 10:09.490
Hey, you almost hit the face.

10:09.590 --> 10:12.960
Let a man get
a hairnet, first.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.300
I call this
"The Sophie Technique."

10:34.310 --> 10:35.680
Look what you did!

10:35.780 --> 10:37.020
What you did!

10:37.110 --> 10:38.640
What you did!!

10:42.820 --> 10:45.220
- What are you doing?
- Texting my Abuela.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.860
I can't remember if
her curse starts with

10:46.960 --> 10:49.760
"I invoke" or "I summon."

10:51.200 --> 10:54.270
Yeah, like I believe in that
Chupacabra nonsense.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.230
Okay, but seriously, don't...
don't do that.

10:57.330 --> 10:59.090
We'll do it your way.

11:01.810 --> 11:03.240
A severe tornado warning

11:03.340 --> 11:05.410
is in effect for our area.

11:05.510 --> 11:09.510
- I could watch these colorful
blobs all night.

11:09.610 --> 11:12.970
Or at least for the next
38 minutes.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.940
- Sawyer, there's
something weird.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.890
And it's not just
your accent.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.920
First, you wanted
to pair up with me.

11:19.020 --> 11:20.790
Then you wanted to take those

11:20.890 --> 11:22.690
long, slow walks
in the hallways,

11:22.790 --> 11:24.450
and now you just wanna
sit here together

11:24.560 --> 11:26.330
watching boring weather radar?

11:26.430 --> 11:28.430
It's almost as if...

11:30.230 --> 11:32.590
I think I know what's
going on here.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.160
- You do?

11:34.270 --> 11:36.140
But I was so careful
not to let you find out.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.280
- You have a crush on me.
- I was only trying--

11:39.380 --> 11:42.050
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you say "crush"?

11:42.150 --> 11:45.320
That's crazy. I do not
have a crush on you.

11:45.420 --> 11:46.920
- Really?

11:47.020 --> 11:49.320
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

11:49.420 --> 11:51.290
Wow, that's embarrassing.

11:51.390 --> 11:54.290
Could this birthday
get any worse?

11:54.390 --> 11:56.190
I've gotta find Bella.

11:56.290 --> 11:57.250
- Wait, Pepper.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.430
- Please, Sawyer, I feel
dumb enough as it is.

11:59.530 --> 12:01.130
- Don't go.
- Why not?

12:01.230 --> 12:03.000
- Because...

12:03.100 --> 12:08.140
I do have a...crush on you.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.910
Happy Birthday?

12:16.580 --> 12:20.080
- Storm Chaser Ace McFumbles
here on the scene!

12:20.180 --> 12:22.840
We pedalled out here
to the heart of the action!

12:24.860 --> 12:26.790
- Whoa! Wow! This storm's
getting closer

12:26.890 --> 12:29.690
than my sister
and her pet ferret.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.320
They groom each other.
It's creepy.

12:32.430 --> 12:36.800
- Ace! Can we go home
where it's safe?!

12:36.900 --> 12:39.500
- No, it's perfectly
safe out here!

12:39.600 --> 12:42.000
See? Look!
There's a bird flying.

12:42.110 --> 12:43.440
- That's not a bird!

12:43.540 --> 12:44.710
It's a cat!

12:44.810 --> 12:47.750
A cat!!

12:49.650 --> 12:54.550
- Okay, that did
not sound good.

12:57.050 --> 12:58.650
Bella, are you okay?

12:58.760 --> 13:00.830
- I know these tornado warnings
never turn into anything.

13:02.790 --> 13:04.350
- But this sounds
like something.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.960
- Just come down.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.890
- I...I can't.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.100
My hair is caught.
I'm stuck.

13:12.070 --> 13:14.510
- You...you have to
get me down!

13:14.610 --> 13:16.170
- I'm coming, Bella.

13:16.270 --> 13:18.770
Just as soon as I get over
my crippling fear of heights.

13:21.810 --> 13:24.420
- I'm probably not
coming, Bella.

13:24.510 --> 13:28.080
- ♪

13:32.490 --> 13:34.790
- It's no use calling
for help, Bella.

13:34.890 --> 13:36.360
Cell service is down.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.200
- Please, just climb
up and help me.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.970
- Oh, stomach ache.

13:42.070 --> 13:44.100
Sweaty palms?

13:44.200 --> 13:47.810
Newt, stop faking.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.180
- Okay, I can do this.
I can do this.

13:57.650 --> 13:59.750
- I can't believe it.
- Why not?

13:59.850 --> 14:00.950
Lights go out in
storms all the time.

14:01.050 --> 14:04.120
- No, that you have
a crush on me.

14:04.220 --> 14:06.260
- You're still thinkin'
about that, huh?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.730
- I mean, it's just
so unexpected.

14:08.830 --> 14:09.990
- Yeah, I know.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.850
I did not think
I was gonna say that.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.970
Not at all.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.790
Can you hand me
that flashlight?

14:17.230 --> 14:18.860
- Oh, it sounds like
it's getting worse out there.

14:18.970 --> 14:21.970
We should stay here.
It's nice and safe.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.180
- Look, Sawyer,
I'm super flattered.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.980
And I know this whole storm
feels like a romantic moment.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.510
And I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

14:29.610 --> 14:33.010
But the truth is,
I'm just not into guys like you.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.020
- What do you mean
guys like me?

14:35.120 --> 14:37.890
- No offense, but we have
like nothing in common.

14:37.990 --> 14:41.130
You're a country boy
and I'm a city girl.

14:41.220 --> 14:42.380
At least, I will be one day.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.630
I wanna see the world
when I grow up.

14:44.730 --> 14:46.230
- Well, I do, too.

14:46.330 --> 14:48.630
I'm gonna backpack through
Argentina and then Brazil.

14:48.730 --> 14:49.930
- Really?

14:50.030 --> 14:51.160
I always thought you were
one of those farm boys

14:51.270 --> 14:53.440
who never wanted to set
foot outside of Texas.

14:53.540 --> 14:54.840
- Well, I caught
the travel bug last summer

14:54.940 --> 14:57.210
when my family
took a trip to Paris.

14:57.310 --> 15:00.040
- You've actually been to Paris?

15:00.140 --> 15:02.100
- Yeah, we went to buy
some French dairy cows.

15:02.210 --> 15:05.150
That's where we got Bonaparte
and Cam-moo.

15:05.250 --> 15:08.350
Their milk has a certain
je ne sais quoi.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.560
- I've always wanted to
see the City of Lights.

15:10.650 --> 15:12.150
- Ah, la ville lumière.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.230
I wondered why
they call it that.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.220
Then I walked along
the Seine at night.

15:16.330 --> 15:19.630
There were hundreds of street
lamps all in gold by the water.

15:19.730 --> 15:21.800
I've never seen
anything like it.

15:21.900 --> 15:24.770
- Sawyer Huggins,
you are full of surprises.

15:24.870 --> 15:26.200
- Yeah, so is Coach's desk.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.200
I just found a buffalo
wing down here.

15:31.270 --> 15:35.840
Well, the power's out.

15:35.950 --> 15:39.320
And so is the oven.

15:39.420 --> 15:42.590
- We can't serve cake soup.

15:42.690 --> 15:45.320
- Relax, okay. We can still
make Pepper a cake.

15:45.420 --> 15:46.390
My way.

15:46.490 --> 15:49.760
- Oh, like a contestant
in America's Worst Chef?

15:49.860 --> 15:51.860
- Have a little faith.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.730
All right, we've got, um...

15:54.830 --> 15:57.640
Some strawberry jelly.

15:57.730 --> 16:01.100
cookies and...

16:01.200 --> 16:04.870
a hundred little
ice cream cups.

16:04.980 --> 16:09.950
I'm thinking Ice Cream
Surprise Supreme Cake.

16:10.050 --> 16:12.280
- That's actually
a pretty good idea.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.890
- Yeah and for the frosting,
we can use...

16:14.990 --> 16:16.190
- Cream cheese!

16:16.290 --> 16:20.160
- Now you're improvising.

16:20.260 --> 16:23.330
- I've gotta admit
this is kinda genius.

16:23.430 --> 16:26.100
- Ha, you know it and you
are free to repeat it, okay?

16:26.200 --> 16:29.770
- I'm already sorry
I said it, okay?

16:33.340 --> 16:35.640
Ah!

16:35.740 --> 16:38.040
Ah!

16:38.140 --> 16:40.480
Ahhhhh!

16:40.580 --> 16:44.580
- You're doing great, Newt.
Just a little ways more.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.350
- I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

16:47.450 --> 16:49.590
I'll be there soon, Bella.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.520
- It's just the lights.
Now you can see again.

16:56.630 --> 16:57.760
- That's the problem.

16:57.860 --> 17:00.200
I can see my final
resting place.

17:04.329 --> 17:07.200
- Hang on, Bella.
I'm comin' for ya.

17:10.810 --> 17:13.210
- Newt.
You did it!

17:13.310 --> 17:15.380
- I...I did it.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.950
Wow.

17:17.050 --> 17:18.550
I did it.

17:18.650 --> 17:20.819
I'm way up here
and I'm not even scared.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.390
I conquered my fear.

17:22.490 --> 17:24.589
This is incredible.
This feels amazing.

17:24.690 --> 17:26.260
This feels like--

17:26.359 --> 17:28.290
- Something we can talk about
when we're back on the ground?

17:28.390 --> 17:31.800
- Right. Sorry, Bella.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.730
- No way. You like fishin'?

17:33.830 --> 17:35.870
- Yeah. You know what
my favorite part is?

17:35.970 --> 17:37.030
- Fryin' and eatin' 'em?

17:37.130 --> 17:38.360
- I was going to say
letting them go

17:38.470 --> 17:40.870
so they can swim
back to their families.

17:40.970 --> 17:43.270
- Oh, that's fun, too.

17:43.370 --> 17:45.030
- Hey, have you ever
been fishin' at night?

17:45.140 --> 17:46.710
It's amazing.
You can see all the stars.

17:46.810 --> 17:48.610
- Oh, I love stargazing.

17:48.710 --> 17:49.950
- You should come out
to my farm sometime.

17:50.050 --> 17:52.320
At night, you can see
the whole Milky Way.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.290
And two snooty French cows.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.580
Man, they have an attitude.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.090
- Wow, look, I just realized
the lights are back on.

18:02.190 --> 18:03.490
- Huh, I didn't even notice.

18:03.590 --> 18:05.650
Looks like the worst
part of the storm's over.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.730
Well, that was surprisingly...
- Fun, right?

18:08.830 --> 18:10.670
Talking with you
turned out to be

18:10.770 --> 18:12.840
the best part
of my worst birthday.

18:12.940 --> 18:14.840
- Oh, I'll take that
as a compliment.

18:14.940 --> 18:16.810
- Sawyer, that thing
I said earlier

18:16.910 --> 18:18.240
about you not being
my type...

18:18.340 --> 18:21.210
- Oh, hang on one sec.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.180
Uh, we should get
back to the others.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.520
I'm sorry, what were
you saying?

18:25.620 --> 18:28.290
- Never mind.
We should go.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.260
- Ace McFumbles here.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.360
It seems like the storm has
finally started to calm down.

18:36.460 --> 18:40.130
And we have made
it through unscathed.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.400
- Unscathed?

18:41.500 --> 18:46.070
Look at me.
I am 100 percent scathed.

18:46.170 --> 18:49.070
And where's my bike?

18:49.170 --> 18:52.540
- It's right...here.
Heh-heh.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.380
There's a little bit
more over there. Heh-heh.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.850
And, uh, the rest of
it's up in that tree.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.060
- Where is everybody?
- Surprise!

19:05.160 --> 19:07.530
- Wow! Look at all of this.

19:07.620 --> 19:10.120
When did you...?
How did you...?

19:10.230 --> 19:11.830
The lights are amazing.

19:11.930 --> 19:14.070
- Yeah, hanging them during
the tornado warning

19:14.160 --> 19:15.860
wasn't the smartest
thing to do.

19:15.970 --> 19:19.840
I kinda got stuck up there.
- Oh, my gosh, Bella.

19:21.070 --> 19:23.140
I had the bravest storm buddy
a girl could ask for.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.210
- Oh, it was nothing.

19:25.310 --> 19:28.550
I just free-climbed a rope
and, you know, saved her.

19:28.650 --> 19:30.280
- Well done, safety warden.

19:30.380 --> 19:31.720
You totally had me going.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.950
I actually believed
you had a crush on me.

19:34.050 --> 19:37.520
But you were just trying to
distract me the whole time.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.390
- Yeah, that's right,
just foolin' the whole time--

19:40.490 --> 19:43.330
for the surprise and all.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.660
- Happy Birthday!

19:53.440 --> 19:56.240
- Okay, guys, get ready
for culinary greatness.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.240
This is just
a little something

19:58.340 --> 20:00.240
that Sophie and I
whipped up together.

20:00.340 --> 20:04.770
- We improvised.
- Mm-hm.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.320
- What's in this?

20:06.420 --> 20:09.020
The frosting tastes
like chives. Ooh.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.060
- And garlic.

20:11.150 --> 20:13.780
- Wow, I've gotta
get this recipe.

20:13.890 --> 20:17.600
- Did you not look at the label
on the cream cheese?

20:17.690 --> 20:19.350
- What? It was hard
to see, Sophie.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.130
The lights were out.

20:21.230 --> 20:23.400
- You ruined another cake!

20:23.500 --> 20:25.040
En el nombre de mi abuela

20:25.140 --> 20:27.740
¡Le imploroal Chupacabra que te
moleste en tus sueños!

20:27.840 --> 20:32.510
- You put a curse on me,
didn't you?

20:32.610 --> 20:34.650
- Hey, the tornado
warning's been lifted.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.790
- Pepper, I'm sorry
you got trapped here.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.380
I know the Bulldogs'
gym doesn't compare

20:42.490 --> 20:45.390
to the big, fancy party
you had planned.

20:45.490 --> 20:46.620
- It turns out
the only thing I needed

20:46.720 --> 20:48.820
for a great birthday
is you guys.

20:48.930 --> 20:51.130
Aw...

20:51.230 --> 20:53.700
And maybe those guys, too.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.630
- Well, uh, since
we're all friends,

20:55.730 --> 20:57.500
do you wanna take
that curse off me?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.100
Let me think about it.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.210
No.

21:09.350 --> 21:10.950
- And on a final note,
I've received numerous calls

21:11.050 --> 21:13.550
from concerned
Silverado citizens--

21:13.650 --> 21:16.290
and the national
weather service,

21:16.390 --> 21:18.120
and the Sheriff's Department.

21:18.220 --> 21:22.530
Apparently, children should not
go out during a tornado warning.

21:22.630 --> 21:24.030
I don't know how you're
supposed to get

21:24.130 --> 21:27.260
all that from a siren, but--
- Sweetie...

21:27.360 --> 21:30.020
stick to the apology script.

21:30.130 --> 21:32.360
- Sorry, Mom.

21:32.470 --> 21:34.340
Don't storm chase
at home, kids.

21:34.440 --> 21:35.870
It's not worth it.

21:35.970 --> 21:38.040
Seriously, I'm grounded
until I graduate.

21:38.140 --> 21:39.940
Which is good because...

21:40.040 --> 21:43.570
It's gonna take me a long time
to put this bike back together.

21:44.305 --> 21:50.775
