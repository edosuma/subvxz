01:46.200 --> 01:49.300
i found ???

01:54.500 --> 01:56.400
you guys handle murders, right?

01:59.400 --> 02:01.200
so, what's
this big clue?

02:01.600 --> 02:03.600
it's all
on this disposable phone --

02:04.400 --> 02:06.200
text messages.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.199
let me see.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.400
what is it worth to you?

02:15.100 --> 02:16.000
are you nuts?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.700
i should arrest you right now
for wasting our time.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.400
what's your name again?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.000
sam linsky.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.900
um, look, okay.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.500
i got like 20 hours
community service left.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.500
you guys are cops. you guys
can make that go away, right?

02:31.700 --> 02:33.400
what was your offense?

02:33.400 --> 02:35.200
i threw a banana peel
out of my car

02:35.200 --> 02:36.800
right in front of
the california highway patrol.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.900
so you littered
is what you did.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.500
well, i --
a banana peel's biodegradable.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.900
<i>and i was driving --
i was driving a hybrid.</i>

02:46.700 --> 02:50.000
this is a real crime.
this is murder.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.900
give me the phone,
and i'll see what we can do.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.300
that's good.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.200
check out those text messages --
pretty scary stuff.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.700
shut up.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.700
they're talking about
offing some dude, right?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.300
am i right?

03:25.400 --> 03:26.800
where did you find this?

03:26.800 --> 03:29.400
uh, by the 110.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.000
i'm sorry.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.700
something out there is
really affecting my allergies.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.600
oh, my --

03:42.400 --> 03:44.800
i can't even make out
the letters.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.900
lieutenant,
my future sister-in-law

03:47.900 --> 03:49.200
is on her way
to my house right now,

03:49.200 --> 03:50.300
and i was supposed to
cook dinner.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.700
are you sure
this is important?

03:51.700 --> 03:53.000
my gut says yeah.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.100
okay.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.200
why are the words
so tiny?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.500
who were they texting to --
mice?

04:04.100 --> 04:05.300
hey, look.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.100
come with me,

04:07.100 --> 04:10.400
and we'll fix it so that we can
all read it at the same time.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.399
go on. get!

04:17.200 --> 04:18.600
gabriel:
"i love you.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.100
"you love me.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.400
can't we just run away
together?"

04:22.400 --> 04:26.000
"after, we can be
together forever,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.200
and we'll have all the money
for ourselves."

04:28.200 --> 04:29.900
"i miss your voice."

04:31.000 --> 04:33.100
"we can't use
our own phones anymore.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.200
"bergman's/6.
vermillion/7.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.300
"tai pei/murray/930.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.300
please don't let him
come home and paw me."

04:39.300 --> 04:40.100
"i h8 him."

04:40.100 --> 04:43.000
"he has 2 die.
dead. dead. dead."

04:43.000 --> 04:43.900
provenza:
oh, yeah.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.100
sounds like our kind of girl,
all right.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.000
flynn:
yeah. okay, buzz.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.300
scroll down to the place
that i showed you, please.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.600
"it's done."

04:52.600 --> 04:53.800
"are you sure?"

04:53.800 --> 04:55.000
"he's dead."

04:55.000 --> 04:56.100
"are you okay?"

04:56.100 --> 04:58.000
"it's my job.
i'm fine.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.600
looks like an accident.
no one will know."

05:00.600 --> 05:01.800
"call u soon."

05:01.800 --> 05:04.900
it's his job?
was she dating a hit man?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.900
and two days later.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.800
"we have 2 meet.
need to c u."

05:09.800 --> 05:11.800
daniels: "must b mourning.
we can't talk."

05:11.800 --> 05:12.600
"please."

05:12.600 --> 05:13.500
"stay away.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.700
i'll text u
when it's safe."

05:14.700 --> 05:16.800
okay.
and then two days after that?

05:18.300 --> 05:19.300
"where are u?

05:19.300 --> 05:21.600
y didn't you say
it would be like this?"

05:21.600 --> 05:25.300
she stops answering him.
the rest are all incoming.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.000
"u can't do this to me."
"don't ignore me."

05:28.000 --> 05:30.600
"you used me,"
and -- and...

05:36.100 --> 05:38.800
she used her boyfriend
to kill her husband

05:38.800 --> 05:41.400
and then cut off communication.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.500
now we know
why she tossed the phone.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.400
all right,
lieutenant tao,

05:47.400 --> 05:49.000
what do we know
about these phone numbers?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.500
both are registered
as prepaid,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
but i'm trying to find out
where they were sold.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.200
but there were no voice calls
on either one, just texts.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.000
want me to call
the other number, chief?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.400
no.
we can't alert the suspects.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.200
we don't even have
a victim yet.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.700
it's dying.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.300
what?
the cellphone's losing
its charge.

06:04.300 --> 06:07.300
oh, for heaven's sakes.
let me take a look at that.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.400
it's all right, chief.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.000
the text is still in the phone,
and i typed it up.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.800
it's printing
right now.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.100
here you go.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.100
thank you.
and i also have...

06:19.000 --> 06:20.800
no!
what?

06:21.400 --> 06:23.900
i left my bag of chargers
at home.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.400
did i?

06:25.700 --> 06:26.800
they got to be here
somewhere.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.300
so, a week ago last wednesday,
she texted the words

06:30.300 --> 06:32.900
"bergman's," "vermillion,"
"tai pei"

06:32.900 --> 06:34.900
with numbers by them, like...

06:34.900 --> 06:36.900
times, maybe?
a schedule?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.900
bergman's could be
the department store --

06:38.900 --> 06:41.300
probably five of them
in los angeles.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.800
vermillion is a color, chief --
part of the red family.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.700
it's a shade darker
than persimmon.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.200
that's helpful.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.000
and tai pei
is the capital of taiwan.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
that's also a great
chinese joint on ventura.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.600
but i think you're
on to something, chief.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.600
it sounds like
the victim's itinerary.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.100
so tai pei and murray
could be a name on a reservation

07:00.100 --> 07:01.500
or an employee.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.900
all right --
detective daniels,

07:13.900 --> 07:16.400
please have the coroner's office
compile a list

07:16.400 --> 07:19.600
of all the men who died
in the county last week.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.500
let's include ventura,
riverside,

07:21.500 --> 07:22.800
and orange counties as well.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.100
lieutenant provenza,
let's compare

07:24.100 --> 07:26.600
wednesday night's reservations
from that chinese restaurant,

07:26.600 --> 07:29.200
uh, tai pei, with the names
of the dead people

07:29.200 --> 07:30.800
on detective daniels' list.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.000
sergeant gabriel,
let's do the same

07:32.000 --> 07:33.900
with the customers
from bergman's.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.600
and let's see
if there's one name

07:35.600 --> 07:37.900
that comes up
on all three lists.

07:37.900 --> 07:40.700
and, lieutenant tao,
i want to know everything i can

07:40.700 --> 07:43.400
about those cellphones, please.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.400
and, detective sanchez,

07:44.400 --> 07:48.500
if you could find out what
"vermillion" might actually be.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.800
oh, i'm so behind!

07:58.900 --> 08:00.500
hey, honey!

08:01.000 --> 08:01.800
sister!

08:01.800 --> 08:04.800
sister, sister, sister, sister,
sister, sister, sister!

08:04.900 --> 08:05.600
claire.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.900
claire!
claire, claire, claire.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.000
my sister claire.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.100
you're gonna break her.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.300
relax, fritzi.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.700
you know howard women
don't break so easily.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.700
i'm not a howard woman just yet.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.000
just one more week
to go.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.200
and what a week
it's gonna be,

08:20.200 --> 08:22.000
<i>because i am here
to help you.</i>

08:22.300 --> 08:23.600
take a gander.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.200
oh.
i made a sprout salad.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.600
i have
a vegetarian chicken potpie,

08:28.600 --> 08:30.700
my self-award-winning
tofurkey,

08:30.700 --> 08:34.100
and for dessert, we have
carob-and-walnut souffl?

08:34.100 --> 08:35.299
i hope you like vegan.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.799
oh, claire.
you shouldn't have.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.500
i-i was gonna cook.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.600
oh, no, no, no.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.700
she insisted.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.900
<i>and you weren't here.</i>

08:44.100 --> 08:46.800
oh, i'm sorry.
i-i-i was, uh, delayed.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.000
and, uh, um,
on -- on the way home,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.400
i had to pick up a charger
for a disposable phone.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.800
um, sorry. let me just, uh,
plug in this cellphone.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.000
i need it for my case.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.500
must be
pretty interesting.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.900
i see a lot of shadows
around that phone.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.400
very spooky. would you like
for me to hold it a moment?

09:06.400 --> 09:09.300
why?
fritz: oh, didn't
i tell you, honey?

09:09.300 --> 09:12.000
claire's decided
she's a psychic.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.100
oh. really?

09:14.100 --> 09:15.800
oh, i-i did not know that.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.900
actually, it's not a decision,
it's a gift.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.600
i've had it
since i was a child.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.300
remember the time
i saved your life?

09:21.300 --> 09:23.400
i warned you not to step out
of the tree house.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.400
yeah, because you pulled
the ladder away.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.800
look, i don't
want to fight.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.800
anyway, i prefer
the word "intuitionist."

09:28.800 --> 09:31.600
people hear the word "psychic,"
and they think "wack job."

09:31.600 --> 09:34.000
hey, what kind of dressing do
you want on your sprout salad?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.200
i have red curry peppercorn,
and i have organic goddess.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.500
don't tell me!
i know exactly what you want!

09:41.600 --> 09:43.000
i'm gonna grab
a scotch.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.800
no. honey.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.800
claire: so you don't know
the name of your victim yet?

09:46.800 --> 09:47.600
brenda:
not yet.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.900
okay, well, nowadays,
i mostly just read auras.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.400
as a matter of fact,
i even started my own
consulting company

09:52.400 --> 09:54.300
called claire-voyance.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.000
isn't that cute?
remind me to give you a card.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.600
but in addition to romantic
and financial advice,

09:59.600 --> 10:01.600
i sometimes help
local law enforcement agencies

10:01.600 --> 10:04.300
back in jersey with murders
and missing persons.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.200
oh, thank you.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.000
h-how many cases
have you solved?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.800
um, well, mostly
i just give tips,

10:08.800 --> 10:11.900
but i think i've contributed
to about 100 investigations.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.700
i thought you had
an exercise studio of some kind.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.000
yeah, back in princeton
called bodily movements.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.600
but i had to
shut it down.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.800
i got caught in the middle
of a power struggle

10:23.800 --> 10:25.200
in the yoga community.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.700
it's still pending.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.500
but i'm thinking about
moving to santa fe.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.100
i'd be closer to you guys.
fun!

10:33.100 --> 10:36.000
i even offered to help fritzi
here with this el jefe case,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
but i think he's too embarrassed
to have me around the office.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.100
that's not true.
more tofurkey, anyone?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.600
no? that's okay.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.100
it keeps.

10:45.100 --> 10:48.000
<i>well, maybe you could help me
with my murder case.</i>

10:48.000 --> 10:50.500
really?
oh, brenda, that'd be great.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.000
and you and i can get
to know each other better.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.800
yes.
yeah, that's --
that's terrific.

10:53.800 --> 10:54.800
honey, you want to
help me clear?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.900
oh, sure.
sit.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.500
you're our guest.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.300
okay. thanks.
oh, i'm so excited!

11:00.300 --> 11:01.700
be right back.
me too.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.100
to think that i've been solving
cases the old-fashioned way

11:08.100 --> 11:10.400
when help was just
a telepathic message away.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.100
look, before yoga...

11:14.100 --> 11:17.500
...she tried glassblowing
and making her own soap.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.800
so the reason
i didn't say anything

11:18.800 --> 11:21.100
about this psychic stuff was
because i honestly thought --

11:21.100 --> 11:24.100
oh, you've been
working so hard,

11:24.100 --> 11:26.300
and things are slow
for us.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.900
it's my turn to entertain
the relatives.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.200
claire may be
a bit touched,

11:31.200 --> 11:33.500
but she seems
perfectly harmless.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.600
she might enjoy coming
to my work and seeing what i do.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
what? no!

11:37.600 --> 11:39.100
no, no, no, no!

11:39.100 --> 11:41.700
i wouldn't let her anywhere near
a murder case.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.400
do you remember
when the fbi sent 30 agents in

11:44.400 --> 11:47.800
to drain that lake in virginia,
looking for anthrax?

11:48.300 --> 11:49.900
that was her!
oh.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.600
what?
what is the matter?

11:54.600 --> 11:56.100
he's not done killing!

11:56.100 --> 11:57.600
what, do you have
another vision?

11:57.600 --> 12:01.000
no, the phone's working,
but he left a text message.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.300
look!

12:06.700 --> 12:08.900
"u r dead."

12:28.900 --> 12:31.100
oh, for heaven's sakes.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.200
oh, you scared me to death.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
why is your whole squad
here on a saturday?

12:37.100 --> 12:39.900
because killers work weekends,
too, will,

12:39.900 --> 12:42.600
and, uh, we got
a cellphone yesterday that --

12:42.600 --> 12:44.300
yeah, i read
gabriel's report.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.500
an unidentified woman

12:45.500 --> 12:48.100
may or may not have talked
her unidentified boyfriend

12:48.100 --> 12:50.800
into murdering her -- yes --
unidentified husband.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.200
well, there are
a few gaps,

12:52.200 --> 12:53.500
but we're working hard
on finding out

12:53.500 --> 12:55.800
<i>who these people are --
or were, anyway.</i>

12:55.800 --> 12:57.900
and even if this was a homicide,
what's the big rush?

12:57.900 --> 12:59.000
it could have happened
over a week ago.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.800
the killer sent a text message
last night

13:00.800 --> 13:03.500
threatening to off
his girlfriend.
why?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.200
it looks like she dumped him
after he murdered her husband,

13:06.200 --> 13:08.000
<i>so we're not just trying
to solve a murder, will,</i>

13:08.000 --> 13:09.200
<i>we're trying
to prevent one.</i>

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
what are you doing here
on a saturday, anyway?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
well, we have
personnel issues.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
i've lost a lot
of experienced people in c.i.,

13:16.000 --> 13:17.400
and i need to find
replacements.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.600
it's gonna mean a promotion
for somebody.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.900
n-not from my team.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.500
i have limited places
from which i can pull,

13:24.500 --> 13:28.000
<i>so yes, brenda,
maybe from major crimes.</i>

13:28.000 --> 13:31.700
but i'm not ???

13:31.700 --> 13:33.100
all i want to
make very clear now

13:33.100 --> 13:35.900
is that if you don't find
a victim today,

13:35.900 --> 13:37.200
no more overtime.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.700
but who would you take
from m-my division?

13:41.200 --> 13:41.500
you know what?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.600
let's deal with the future
when it gets here, okay?

13:43.600 --> 13:46.300
just try not to spend all day
on this case, okay?

13:55.500 --> 13:58.000
oh, sister!
oh, i have good news!

13:58.000 --> 14:00.600
lieutenant provenza here
showed me all the text messages,

14:00.600 --> 14:03.000
and i was able to get an image
of the killer's face.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.900
while you were out,
i called in a sketch artist.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.800
no. really.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.600
and then later we're
gonna make balloon animals.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.200
well, the victim...

14:15.900 --> 14:16.800
yes, i...

14:18.100 --> 14:23.000
...i see -- i see a river
and a bridge

14:23.000 --> 14:24.600
and a nearby train...

14:24.600 --> 14:27.800
and -- and a barking dog
in the background.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.100
and -- and
an odd-looking tree.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.900
a river, a train,
and a barking dog.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.300
throw in a pickup truck,
and we've got a country song.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.200
excuse me for a minute.
i'll be right back.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.700
brenda:
well, thank you so much, claire.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.500
you be careful out there.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.400
chief?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.300
yes.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.800
i've never had a useful tip
from a psychic ever.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.000
she's not a psychic.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.500
she's an intuitionist
and my future sister-in-law.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.300
oh, come on.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.300
do you have any idea

15:03.300 --> 15:05.600
who's in danger of being
murdered later on today?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.900
no? well, then let's keep
moving, shall we?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.900
where are we
on these text messages

15:10.900 --> 15:12.100
that look like a schedule --

15:12.100 --> 15:13.700
bergman's, vermillion,
tai pei?

15:13.700 --> 15:15.900
ah, there are
nine bergman's stores

15:15.900 --> 15:17.500
between orange county
and ventura.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.000
the corporate office
sent over a complete list

15:20.000 --> 15:22.800
of every credit-card transaction
from last wednesday.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.800
uh, unfortunately,
none of them matches up

15:24.800 --> 15:26.600
with the 23 male deaths
in l.a.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.800
or the surrounding counties
on that day.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.700
lieutenant provenza!
yes, ma'am?

15:31.500 --> 15:32.700
what do you know
about vermillion?

15:32.700 --> 15:35.400
oh, uh, no -- still --
still working on that.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.100
but, uh,
yesterday after work,

15:37.100 --> 15:40.100
i did stop by tai pei
for dinner.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.400
and, uh,
wednesday before last,

15:42.400 --> 15:45.400
<i>there was a reservation
for a guy, last name murray --</i>

15:45.400 --> 15:46.600
table for two at 9:30.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.000
manager says
murray waited half an hour,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
dined alone, paid cash.

15:51.000 --> 15:51.700
lieutenant tao,

15:51.700 --> 15:53.600
what do we know
about those prepaid cellphones?

15:53.600 --> 15:54.500
tao:
the phones were purchased

15:54.500 --> 15:57.500
from the same convenience store
10 days ago --

15:57.500 --> 15:59.000
also for cash.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.600
but the security-camera tape
is on a seven-day loop,

16:02.600 --> 16:04.200
so the footage
is already gone.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.700
and the guy
behind the counter

16:05.700 --> 16:08.200
<i>doesn't remember
who he sold the phones to.</i>

16:11.500 --> 16:14.900
the first marriage
was devoured by jealousy.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.500
the husband wanted his wife
to stop working.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
he thought she was having
an affair with a co-worker.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.700
<i>she did have an affair
with a colleague,</i>

16:26.900 --> 16:29.500
but that was before --
no! i see a sequoia!

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
no! a-a tree!
no, no.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.800
she had feelings
for someone else --

16:33.800 --> 16:37.600
???

16:37.600 --> 16:39.900
wait.
i should be like recording this.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.500
lieutenant flynn, why don't you
stop by the convenience store

16:42.500 --> 16:43.900
where those
phones were bought

16:43.900 --> 16:45.400
and talk to the guy
who sold them,

16:45.400 --> 16:47.000
see if you can
jog his memory?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.300
chief,
you can't be serious.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.000
i mean, those people
wouldn't remember a man

16:50.000 --> 16:52.300
who came in with an elephant
to buy a quart of milk.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.700
then why don't you take claire
with you?

16:54.700 --> 16:55.300
what?

16:55.300 --> 16:57.200
claire: if i could just hold
the clerk's hand,

16:57.200 --> 16:59.700
i might be able to see the
killer through his mind's eye.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.900
sound good, lieutenant?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.099
sounds great, chief.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.700
come on, i'll give you
a ride-along.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.400
oh, terrific.
just a second.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.200
i just want to see this
for a second.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.400
my phone chargers!

17:17.099 --> 17:21.099
no, unh-unh.
make him bald, completely bald.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.400
yeah. good job, everyone!
see you later!

17:24.400 --> 17:25.800
thank you!
bye!

17:26.800 --> 17:28.500
flynn.
what?

17:28.500 --> 17:31.400
ooh, i've got
a bad feeling about this.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.800
yeah. me too.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.100
tao: chief?

17:39.300 --> 17:40.900
claire might be
on to something.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.300
there's the literal
and there's the abstract.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.300
oh, come on.

17:44.700 --> 17:48.000
not everything in this universe
is visible to the naked eye.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.300
she may be talking
in images.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.800
sanchez: uh, yeah.
chief, "vermillion" is a play.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.600
it's "a gothic tale
of love and witchcraft

17:55.600 --> 17:58.100
set on the vermillion river
in louisiana."

17:58.100 --> 18:00.200
it runs in westwood
till the end of the month.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.900
they're faxing over a list
of credit-card orders,

18:02.900 --> 18:05.400
but it's a 99-seat
equity-waiver house,

18:05.400 --> 18:07.700
and the theater manager
said everyone showed up.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.800
they turned away people
on standby.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.900
tao: chief!
oh!

18:11.300 --> 18:13.300
yes, lieutenant.
what is it?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.100
vermillion's a river.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.900
just like claire said.
oh, for heaven's sakes.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.500
so, assuming our victim
is a real person,

18:20.500 --> 18:21.600
he made it
to the play.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.300
everybody showed up.
so he was in westwood.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.800
but never made it
to tai pei.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.700
lieutenant provenza,
what is the fastest way

18:31.700 --> 18:33.600
between the theater
and the restaurant?

18:33.700 --> 18:35.200
well, the 405,

18:35.200 --> 18:37.700
but only some poor tourist
would take that.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.300
locals would do beverly glen
or sepulveda.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.200
why?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.700
detective daniels,

18:42.700 --> 18:45.400
please take a look at the list
we got from the morgue

18:45.400 --> 18:48.600
and find me someone who died
wednesday before last between...

18:48.800 --> 18:53.800
the theater at 7:00
and tai pei at 9:30.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.300
taylor: the victim of the
car accident, shawn thompson,

18:56.300 --> 18:57.800
was a major
horror film producer.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.700
and yes, chief,
he is married.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.400
his wife's
christine thompson.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.700
traffic did
a detailed investigation.

19:03.700 --> 19:07.400
now, the vehicle,
a 2008 lexus sedan,

19:07.400 --> 19:09.500
drove right off the cliff
from over there.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.300
the car was inspected.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.000
everything was fully functional
except the air bags.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.200
they were turned off.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.700
uh, what's the interest?

19:18.900 --> 19:20.300
chief!
ugh!

19:20.300 --> 19:21.400
look!

19:21.600 --> 19:23.000
what is it, lieutenant?

19:23.500 --> 19:26.400
a bridge -- just like claire
said we would find.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.300
who's claire?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.800
she's a psychic,
and she's --

19:28.800 --> 19:30.600
you guys are consulting
a psychic?

19:30.600 --> 19:34.100
no, we're not.
excuse me, lieutenant.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.100
uh, were there any skid marks
around this accident

19:37.100 --> 19:38.200
or signs of a collision?

19:38.200 --> 19:41.600
no, no. looks like
he just lost control of the car.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.200
was there a 911 call?

19:45.200 --> 19:49.400
person reporting called
from that pay phone over there.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.300
they didn't stick around
to chat, though.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.600
no other witnesses
came forward.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.100
lieutenant,
i want the 10 calls

19:56.100 --> 19:58.600
made before and after
the 911 call, please.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.300
let's, uh, see what else
we have here.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.600
yeah, the short-form autopsy
says mr. thompson's injuries

20:06.600 --> 20:08.700
<i>were consistent
with an auto accident.</i>

20:08.700 --> 20:10.500
he wasn't wearing
a seat belt.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.000
his blood alcohol
came back .04.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.700
where would he
have had a drink?

20:14.700 --> 20:16.800
how about intermission
at the play?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.500
do you have to use
that tone?

20:18.900 --> 20:20.500
i mean, it's -- it's the tone.
it's -- it's --

20:20.500 --> 20:21.700
uh, excuse me.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.600
anything else, commander?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.200
no, the only other thing
i know

20:26.200 --> 20:28.600
is that mr. thompson's wife,
christine,

20:28.800 --> 20:31.300
took her husband's death
pretty badly.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.200
she may be taking it
worse than you know.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.300
excuse me.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.500
looks like christine thompson
has it pretty good.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.300
<i>tao:
if she's still alive.</i>

20:55.300 --> 20:56.800
i don't know.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.400
it looks like we took a wrong
turn in transylvania to me.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.000
buzz it again, buzz.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.500
i knew you were
gonna say that.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.200
detective, do you think
you can force open this gate?

21:07.200 --> 21:09.600
well, don't have to, chief.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.700
the lock's busted.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.100
there's a dog barking
in the background.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.500
just like claire said.
oh, for heaven's sake.

21:18.900 --> 21:21.000
yes, lieutenant.
it's uncanny.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.100
all right, everybody.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.200
taylor:
look, look, chief.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.500
why don't you let me call in
for a search warrant?

21:26.500 --> 21:27.800
no, i don't think
there's time.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.600
i'm now officially acting
on a tip.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.200
from who -- a psychic?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.000
we have
exigent circumstances.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.800
christine thompson's life
was threatened.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.300
all right, detective.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.000
car's running
in the garage!

22:04.200 --> 22:05.800
don't move!
don't move!

22:06.100 --> 22:08.300
relax, gentlemen.
he's not armed.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.512
thank you

22:16.100 --> 22:19.500
yeah, no pulse.
she's long gone, chief.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.700
so her boyfriend
threatens to kill her,

22:22.700 --> 22:23.600
so she commits suicide?

22:23.600 --> 22:25.100
how does that make sense?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.500
would someone please call
the paramedics?

22:28.500 --> 22:30.200
i want her taken out of here
in an ambulance.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.700
but, chief, she's dead.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.400
well, then
you better hurry.

22:35.700 --> 22:36.500
yes, ma'am.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.300
oh...my...god.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.200
what?
chief, look.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.300
a train.

22:44.700 --> 22:48.000
the river, the bridge,
the barking dogs, the train --

22:48.000 --> 22:49.400
everything claire said.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.300
it's all happening.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.000
chief?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.600
yes, lieutenant.
i'll be right there.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.600
just -- just a word.
i'm -- i'm sorry.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.400
um, i don't know
if you've noticed,

23:08.400 --> 23:10.600
but, uh,
gabriel and daniels

23:10.600 --> 23:13.800
<i>can hardly stand to be in
the same room together anymore.</i>

23:13.800 --> 23:15.200
i already issued an order

23:15.200 --> 23:18.000
for them to sort out
their romantic problems.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.200
you -- you are
an excellent leader, chief,

23:21.500 --> 23:25.800
but...you can't just boss around
the human heart.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.400
lieutenant,
i am in the middle

23:27.400 --> 23:29.300
of a double homicide
investigation.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.700
i don't want to talk about this
right now.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.400
well, i don't want to talk about
it, either, but, look.

23:33.400 --> 23:37.200
sanchez was gone for four months
on a disability leave,

23:37.200 --> 23:38.100
and then --

23:38.100 --> 23:40.400
and then gabriel took a week off
for some training,

23:40.400 --> 23:43.100
and daniels was off
at some homeland security labs

23:43.100 --> 23:43.800
for two weeks.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.300
i mean, look,
i may not be a psychic,

23:46.300 --> 23:48.000
but as an experienced
civil servant,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.600
i can tell you this --

23:49.800 --> 23:52.500
the brass will not let you do
with six people

23:52.500 --> 23:55.200
what you've proven
you can do with five.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.800
chief pope
told me this morning

24:00.800 --> 24:03.300
that he may have to promote
someone from major crimes

24:03.300 --> 24:04.200
to the c.i. division.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.700
well, there it is, then.
there it is.

24:06.700 --> 24:07.700
and i'm telling you,
chief.

24:07.700 --> 24:11.400
h-he could take sanchez
or tao or even flynn.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.800
and our problem
would still be the same,

24:13.800 --> 24:16.100
and it's sitting
right out there.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.300
let's talk about this tomorrow.

24:21.300 --> 24:22.200
chief.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.500
that's twice in one day!

24:26.200 --> 24:28.000
speak of the devil.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.400
what's that about?

24:30.400 --> 24:32.200
uh, nothing, nothing.
what's up?

24:32.400 --> 24:33.800
uh, i was
at the morgue

24:33.800 --> 24:35.500
checking on a murder
for harbor division,

24:35.500 --> 24:37.000
and dr. morales complained

24:37.000 --> 24:40.700
that you had a "creepy lady"
down there with lieutenant flynn

24:40.700 --> 24:41.300
talking to a corpse.

24:41.300 --> 24:42.600
she's not
a creepy lady.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
her name is claire, and she's
my future sister-in-law.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
she helped us
find the victim.
really? how?

24:46.600 --> 24:48.500
uh, claire did not
help us find the victim.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.500
sanchez:
but she guided a sketch artist

24:50.500 --> 24:52.600
<i>into a drawing
of the killer, sir.</i>

24:53.500 --> 24:54.500
check it out.

25:08.000 --> 25:08.900
that's funny.

25:09.100 --> 25:13.000
so, fritz's sister
is a psychic.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.400
no, she's
an intuitionist.

25:16.300 --> 25:17.200
okay.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.800
well, tell claire
that i have a good alibi

25:21.800 --> 25:24.500
<i>for the suicide
that you found today,</i>

25:24.500 --> 25:27.300
which brings me to the question
i came here to ask.

25:27.300 --> 25:27.900
oh, one second.

25:27.900 --> 25:31.000
uh, sergeant, did, um --
did the, uh...

25:32.300 --> 25:33.000
sergeant gabriel,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.800
<i>did christine thompson's
attempted suicide</i>

25:35.800 --> 25:36.900
make it
to the evening news?

25:36.900 --> 25:37.700
uh, top story.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.100
they're saying
she's gonna make it.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.600
okay, so exactly how dead
does this woman have to be

25:41.600 --> 25:42.300
before we announce it?

25:42.300 --> 25:44.000
if the killer thinks
that she's still alive,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.800
we can use that to our advantage
when we catch him.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.100
oh, may we just discuss
the pros and cons

25:49.100 --> 25:51.000
<i>of whether
there is a murder here?</i>

25:51.000 --> 25:52.500
gabriel:
um, pro.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.600
christine had a gash
in her head,

25:53.600 --> 25:55.100
suggesting the killer
knocked her out

25:55.100 --> 25:56.800
and threw her to the ground
and started the engine.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.500
daniels: con.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.300
she had second thoughts
about suicide,

25:59.300 --> 26:02.200
tried to get out of the car,
was overcome by fumes,

26:02.200 --> 26:03.400
fell, and hit her head.

26:03.700 --> 26:06.300
the lock on the front gate
was broken,

26:06.300 --> 26:07.800
suggesting forced entry.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.900
<i>but we don't know
when the lock was broken.</i>

26:09.900 --> 26:11.300
and no prints.

26:11.300 --> 26:14.300
so
why kill yourself

26:14.300 --> 26:15.600
after you've gone through
all the trouble

26:15.600 --> 26:17.100
to have your husband
murdered?

26:17.100 --> 26:20.200
clearly, there are many
possible explanations,

26:20.200 --> 26:21.900
but we do have
that cellphone

26:21.900 --> 26:23.900
that led us right
to shawn thompson and his wife.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.800
and when we went to find out
what was left of the car,

26:26.800 --> 26:30.100
we found a dress from bergman's
that he picked up for his wife

26:30.100 --> 26:32.200
last wednesday
at 6:00 p.m.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.500
so, mr. thompson's schedule
for the day he died

26:34.500 --> 26:37.100
was exactly what the
text message said it would be.

26:37.100 --> 26:39.100
tao: we dumped the pay phone
by the scene of the accident,

26:39.100 --> 26:41.300
and when mr. thompson
drove his car off the road,

26:41.300 --> 26:45.300
someone called for a cab --
american usa taxi.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.600
yeah, flynn stopped there
on his way back from the morgue

26:47.600 --> 26:49.000
to talk to the cabdriver.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.400
oh, my god!
you made the arrest!

26:52.600 --> 26:53.600
no, claire.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.200
this is my boss,
assistant chief will pope.

26:57.900 --> 27:00.000
oh, i must have sensed you

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
hovering around the case
or something.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.900
yeah, i do that sometimes.
i-i hover.

27:06.600 --> 27:07.500
excuse me.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.900
well, major crimes
seems to have had

27:10.900 --> 27:12.600
<i>some very good hunches
on this.</i>

27:12.600 --> 27:15.500
but unless you're planning
to hold a séance,

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
the victims are not going to
tell you how they died.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.600
so let's find some physical
evidence from, you know,

27:20.600 --> 27:24.400
<i>our plane of existence
and wrap this up, all right?</i>

27:24.800 --> 27:25.800
good night, everybody.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.800
pleasant dreams.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.100
skeptics.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.600
some people just won't believe
what they can't see.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.900
like juries.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.600
lieutenant flynn, anything?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.400
okay, well,
i spoke to the cabdriver,

27:39.400 --> 27:41.900
and he said wednesday night
before last,

27:41.900 --> 27:43.900
he picked up a fare
at the bus stop

27:44.100 --> 27:46.300
where shawn thompson's car
went off the road.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.500
but all he could remember
about the passenger

27:48.500 --> 27:51.000
was that he was a white guy
younger than me.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.500
so we're
back to nowhere.
tao: not exactly.

27:54.800 --> 27:59.200
like claire,
i can also see the invisible.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.900
give me a person's phones,

28:02.100 --> 28:04.300
nd i can draw you a picture
of their entire life,

28:04.600 --> 28:06.900
maybe even tell you
their destiny.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.500
and when i am done

28:11.500 --> 28:12.700
we...

28:13.600 --> 28:16.700
will have fulfilled
claire's prophecy.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.800
i dumped all the phones

28:22.800 --> 28:24.800
registered
to christine thompson.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.500
i then created a list of
the most commonly used numbers

28:27.500 --> 28:30.000
in the past months leading up
to her husband's death.

28:30.900 --> 28:32.800
this was her husband, shawn.

28:32.900 --> 28:34.700
hey spoke a lot
during the day.

28:35.100 --> 28:37.600
over here --
mother from sherman oaks.

28:37.600 --> 28:42.100
she had a sister in connecticut
she spoke to on a weekly basis.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
and then this number.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.600
a. raber.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.700
the number first appears
four months ago.

28:54.300 --> 28:57.000
watch how the relationship
develops.

28:57.800 --> 29:03.100
in the beginning, they speak
once every two or three days.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.100
then things heat up.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.500
they talk all the time.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.800
and then this.

29:15.000 --> 29:15.900
what?

29:16.200 --> 29:17.600
nothing.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.300
they suddenly stop speaking.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.800
and on that exact same day,
two prepaid cellphones

29:23.800 --> 29:26.100
are purchased
from a convenience store.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.900
so they began texting
before her husband's murder.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.100
well, how does this fulfill
my prophecy exactly?

29:34.100 --> 29:40.400
we found the bridge, the river,
the train, the barking dog.

29:40.900 --> 29:42.800
what could be
more odd-looking...

29:43.800 --> 29:45.000
...than a phone tree?

29:46.300 --> 29:48.400
i did it!
i really did it!

29:48.400 --> 29:51.300
this is exciting!
who's a. raber?

29:52.200 --> 29:54.200
don't you already know?

29:57.100 --> 29:58.700
sanchez:
his name is andrew raber.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.800
he's a stunt man
for television and film.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.900
andrew raber.

30:04.000 --> 30:04.500
all right.

30:04.500 --> 30:07.400
his film credits include
"house of death,"

30:07.400 --> 30:09.700
"sorority death house,"
"camp murder 1,"

30:10.300 --> 30:11.500
"camp murder 2" --

30:11.500 --> 30:13.200
yeah, and all
those masterpieces

30:13.200 --> 30:17.100
were produced by the same guy --
one shawn thompson.

30:17.100 --> 30:18.600
so shawn knew andrew.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.700
and based
on her cellphone records,

30:20.700 --> 30:22.700
christine knew him, too.

30:23.300 --> 30:26.500
we pulled mr. raber's highlight
reel off of his website.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.200
go ahead, buzz.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.600
i think you're gonna
find this interesting, chief.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.200
buzz, uh, stop it there
and roll it back.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.600
play that
last part again, please.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.600
all righty.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.000
oh, would you
look at that?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.900
"it's my job,"
he said.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.200
crashing vehicles
and falling out of cars.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.600
and he does. might as well
have filmed the murder.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.300
but with no witnesses.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.300
i just can't believe
this is our guy.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.200
how was i
so thrown off?

31:23.200 --> 31:25.100
that's not how i pictured him
at all.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.800
<i>"not how i pictured him."</i>

31:29.500 --> 31:30.300
lieutenant flynn,

31:30.300 --> 31:32.000
i need you to get
the cabdriver in here

31:32.000 --> 31:33.600
and the sketch artist, too.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.200
okay, but who's
she gonna draw?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.500
the killer.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.000
<i>gabriel:
so, you're a stunt man, right?</i>

31:46.800 --> 31:47.600
<i>yeah.</i>

31:48.000 --> 31:49.300
<i>that's cool.</i>

31:49.500 --> 31:51.400
<i>what's the craziest stunt
you ever did?</i>

31:52.400 --> 31:53.900
come on in.
oh, hello.

31:53.900 --> 31:54.700
hi.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.300
why did you bring
this raber guy in on a sunday

31:57.300 --> 31:58.600
when you have
nothing on him?

31:58.600 --> 32:00.800
because he's already killed
two people,

32:00.800 --> 32:04.600
i don't like the idea of him
running around on his own.

32:05.400 --> 32:05.900
all right.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.300
and you can prove
he's a killer?

32:07.600 --> 32:10.300
well, i have a cabdriver
coming in who --

32:10.300 --> 32:10.800
who saw nothing.
and?

32:10.800 --> 32:12.800
and i have
a sketch artist who --

32:12.800 --> 32:15.600
right. who just drew a picture
off the monitor. and?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.800
and i have
christine thompson.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.000
who is dead.
not completely.

32:21.800 --> 32:22.800
technically, though,

32:22.800 --> 32:24.800
by the standards
of the justice system

32:24.800 --> 32:27.500
and, you know, reality --
dead.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.400
i have a plan, sir,
and the sooner i execute it,

32:30.400 --> 32:32.900
<i>the faster we'll all be able
to get off the clock.</i>

32:32.900 --> 32:34.100
so, shall i?

32:35.200 --> 32:36.400
thank you.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.500
oh, buzz.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.100
uh, let me know as soon
as the cabdriver comes in.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.100
yes, ma'am.

32:41.300 --> 32:43.400
oh, no. no, no.
you wait here.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.300
you're a virgo,
aren't you?

32:51.100 --> 32:52.900
stay out of my head,
lady.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.500
<i>yeah, well, half the stuff
you see in movies isn't real.</i>

32:58.500 --> 33:01.800
<i>right.
and what about the other half?</i>

33:04.100 --> 33:05.300
<i>brenda:
andrew raber?</i>

33:05.500 --> 33:07.400
<i>i'm deputy chief
brenda leigh johnson.</i>

33:07.400 --> 33:09.100
<i>thank you so much
for coming in.</i>

33:09.100 --> 33:10.400
<i>how are you
this morning?</i>

33:10.800 --> 33:12.100
a little annoyed.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.500
oh, really?
why is that?

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
you guys pull me
out of my house,

33:15.500 --> 33:17.100
drag me downtown,
and read me my rights

33:17.100 --> 33:18.600
without an explanation.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.600
it's like guantanamo bay
in this place.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.100
oh, look at those terrible
scrapes on your hand!

33:24.100 --> 33:25.300
how'd you get those?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.300
i'm a stunt man.
get banged around a lot.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.100
<i>i'm the guy
you don't see in movies.</i>

33:30.100 --> 33:32.000
part of
the showbiz magic.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.100
well, speaking of showbiz,

33:34.100 --> 33:37.000
we have a couple of questions
for you about a movie producer.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.100
a mr. shawn thompson?

33:39.100 --> 33:42.100
i believe that you're a regular
player in his horror films.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.100
gabriel:
as you may know,

33:43.100 --> 33:47.300
mr. thompson tragically died
in a car accident last week.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.500
yeah.
it's pretty shocking.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.800
and just yesterday, it seemed
that his wife, christine,

33:51.800 --> 33:54.100
locked herself in her garage
with her bentley running --

33:54.100 --> 33:55.300
almost died.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.600
yeah, i saw something about
that on the news. is she okay?

33:57.600 --> 33:58.800
<i>thanks to her barking dogs.</i>

33:58.800 --> 34:01.100
<i>a neighbor called 911 --
saved her life.</i>

34:01.800 --> 34:02.900
we're here.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.900
we've got her
in protective custody.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.400
protective custody?
why?

34:07.600 --> 34:09.600
chief,
the cabdriver's arrived,

34:09.600 --> 34:11.000
<i>and they're
moving into position.</i>

34:13.199 --> 34:15.300
<i>brenda: well, uh,
we have reason to believe</i>

34:15.300 --> 34:16.600
<i>that what happened
to christine</i>

34:16.600 --> 34:20.199
was less attempted suicide
and more of an attempted murder,

34:20.600 --> 34:22.500
which is why we wanted
to talk to you.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.100
to me? why?

34:25.100 --> 34:27.400
well, you were having an affair
with christine, weren't you?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.400
are you kidding?

34:30.699 --> 34:31.500
<i>having a -- no.</i>

34:31.500 --> 34:32.900
<i>who told you that?
i never --</i>

34:32.900 --> 34:34.600
<i>uh, hold on.
hold on --</i>

34:34.600 --> 34:37.000
<i>before you say something you're
gonna have to take back later.</i>

34:37.000 --> 34:38.600
<i>let me show you
what we have.</i>

34:40.000 --> 34:40.900
phone records.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.400
these show
that you and christine

34:43.400 --> 34:46.100
spoke several times a day
for months.

34:47.900 --> 34:48.900
we, uh --

34:49.600 --> 34:51.600
i met christine
on one of shawn's films.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.699
she visited the set
during one of the stunts,

34:53.699 --> 34:56.600
but, i swear,
it was just a friendship.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.500
ask him if he rides a motorcycle.
what are you doing?!

34:59.500 --> 35:00.700
i'm seeing a motorcycle.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.000
give that to me!
but -- no! but --

35:02.000 --> 35:04.400
let go!
i'm seeing an angry wind!

35:04.400 --> 35:06.600
brenda, this is important!
ask about the angry wind!

35:06.600 --> 35:09.200
<i>provenza: i am tired of
farting around with you, lady!</i>

35:09.200 --> 35:10.900
brenda --
give me this microphone
right now!

35:10.900 --> 35:12.000
<i>daniels: no, claire...
no, no...</i>

35:12.000 --> 35:12.900
no!

35:13.200 --> 35:15.500
i'm telling you, if you
touch this microphone again,

35:15.500 --> 35:16.700
when the chief
comes out of there,

35:16.700 --> 35:18.700
you may be speaking
to dead people in person.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.000
now, you get.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.000
do you recognize
this disposable cellphone?

35:29.700 --> 35:30.600
should i?

35:30.600 --> 35:33.200
uh, christine gave me that
when we rescued her.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.700
she said
you bought it for her

35:34.700 --> 35:35.700
and another one
just like it

35:35.700 --> 35:36.900
and that you used them

35:36.900 --> 35:39.600
to help her plan
the murder of her husband.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.100
that's a lie.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.700
this phone texts
shawn's entire schedule

35:43.700 --> 35:45.200
the day of the accident --

35:45.300 --> 35:48.400
the department store, the play,
the chinese restaurant.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.900
but he never made it
to the restaurant, did he?

35:49.900 --> 35:51.600
because you drove his car
off a cliff.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.000
what?! hey!

35:53.000 --> 35:55.200
sit...down.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.200
she's a lying bitch.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.600
i've never seen that phone
before in my life.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.700
i've always been fascinated
by movie stunts.

36:01.700 --> 36:04.500
tell me --
did you knock shawn out

36:04.500 --> 36:06.300
and then point his car
toward the cliff,

36:06.300 --> 36:08.000
and then roll out
at the last second, or --

36:08.000 --> 36:10.200
listen to me.
i wasn't there.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.700
after you staged
the accident,

36:11.700 --> 36:13.300
you used a pay phone
to call a taxicab

36:13.300 --> 36:15.100
that picked you up
at a bus stop down the street.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.400
do you remember
that cabdriver?

36:16.400 --> 36:17.900
'cause he remembers you.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.300
hello, sir.
good to see you again.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.500
thank you so much,
billy.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.500
let's go.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.900
was that him?
i was just guessing.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.500
we've been doing
a lot of that lately.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.500
who's billy?

36:35.500 --> 36:37.100
she meant you,
einstein.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.600
<i>in addition to the cabdriver,
we have other witnesses</i>

36:39.600 --> 36:41.700
<i>that saw you leaving
the crime scene.</i>

36:43.200 --> 36:45.000
there --
there were witnesses?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.600
it was dark outside.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.800
you might not have seen them,
but they saw you.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.200
and this is the picture

36:50.200 --> 36:52.400
that they helped
our sketch artist draw.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.800
notice the similarity?

36:53.800 --> 36:54.900
your girlfriend's
pretty upset

36:54.900 --> 36:56.100
you tried to kill her,
andrew.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.700
and afraid.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.200
she said
she was just joking around

36:59.200 --> 37:01.200
when she talked to you
about killing her husband.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.500
<i>she was stunned
that you actually did it</i>

37:03.500 --> 37:07.000
and even more surprised when
you locked her in the garage

37:07.000 --> 37:08.100
with the car running.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.400
oh, my god.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.100
now, you listen to me.

37:12.500 --> 37:13.600
if you don't tell me
what happened,

37:13.600 --> 37:15.800
i'm gonna have to
go with christine's
version of the events.

37:15.800 --> 37:19.200
she'll walk, and you'll end up
facing the death penalty.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.400
but if she solicited
this murder

37:21.400 --> 37:24.600
and suggested that you and she
would live on shawn's money --

37:24.600 --> 37:27.000
oh, i never gave a damn
about shawn's money!

37:28.500 --> 37:30.300
i only loved christine.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.400
and...i thought
she loved me.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.900
s-she made all these promises
to me.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.500
and after i did it...

37:41.600 --> 37:43.500
...what she
asked me to do...

37:44.700 --> 37:46.300
...she blew me off.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.100
she blew him off...

37:49.600 --> 37:51.500
like an angry wind.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.300
<i>she used me
to get shawn's money.</i>

37:57.100 --> 37:58.500
bitch!

38:01.900 --> 38:03.400
i thought she loved me.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.800
i need some proof
if i'm gonna charge christine.

38:15.700 --> 38:18.000
she bought him the tickets
to "vermillion."

38:19.900 --> 38:23.400
and she gave me the other set
of keys to his car.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.400
i was, uh...

38:29.800 --> 38:32.700
hiding in the backseat
when he came out of the theater.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.100
he was alive
when i did it.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.200
he, uh...

38:39.600 --> 38:42.700
screamed at me --
"why?"

38:43.500 --> 38:46.400
and i told him why.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.200
"because christine
wants it this way."

39:00.200 --> 39:01.500
i should have put
harley and davidson

39:01.500 --> 39:03.400
in the garage with her.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.000
it's your classic
road bike.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.200
<i>harley and davidson?</i>

39:13.900 --> 39:15.700
<i>her stupid dogs.</i>

39:18.700 --> 39:19.700
you, uh...

39:20.900 --> 39:22.500
you believe me,
don't you?

39:22.700 --> 39:24.000
oh, yes.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.000
i think i do.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.000
then do me a favor,
will you?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.200
what's that?

39:32.600 --> 39:35.500
tell christine
i'll see her in hell.

39:38.100 --> 39:39.400
<i>guess what.</i>

39:41.000 --> 39:42.800
she's already there.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.200
??? take ???

39:55.200 --> 39:58.900
???

39:59.400 --> 40:02.400
so ??? guy.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.600
??? c made a pretty good pair.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.200
actually, i didn't help out all
that much, but i have to say,

40:08.200 --> 40:11.100
watching your future wife
at work made me think that maybe

40:11.100 --> 40:12.600
i should give up
the consulting business

40:12.600 --> 40:14.700
and get into law enforcement
full time.

40:14.700 --> 40:17.500
what's going on with this, uh,
el jefe case?

40:17.900 --> 40:19.900
setting up for the big takedown
as we speak.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.200
not much left to do.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.900
okay, well, if you need me,
you know, i'm ready --

40:22.900 --> 40:24.700
no, no, no, no.
we're all set.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.800
you got to keep yourself free
for brenda here.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.600
bye, sweetie. see you tonight.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.000
bye.
bye.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.700
that -- hmm.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.200
bye!
bye.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.900
watch out
for left turns!

40:39.900 --> 40:40.700
what?

40:40.700 --> 40:43.100
never mind. just don't read
anything out loud.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.600
thanks, claire.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.500
see ya.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.000
i can see how crazy you are
about my brother.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.600
i am.
i really am.

40:58.900 --> 40:59.300
hey, listen.

40:59.300 --> 41:01.300
i'm sorry about the mistake
i made the other day.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.400
what's that?

41:03.400 --> 41:06.300
oh, remember the vision i had
about the case?

41:06.500 --> 41:08.700
i said the victim
was on her second marriage

41:08.700 --> 41:11.000
and that her first marriage
ended badly?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
well, you can't be right
about everything.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
<i>yeah, but i was
really off.</i>

41:15.000 --> 41:17.300
and i kept trying to figure out
what it was.

41:17.300 --> 41:20.000
and then i realized
that i had my signals crossed.

41:20.100 --> 41:22.000
i wasn't talking
about the murder.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.900
<i>i was talking about you.</i>

41:26.100 --> 41:27.200
about me?

41:27.200 --> 41:28.400
yeah.

41:28.800 --> 41:32.200
you had an affair
with an office co-worker --

41:32.200 --> 41:35.400
a bald office co-worker --
which ended badly.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.900
so then you married your
first husband on the rebound,

41:38.900 --> 41:41.800
and he was
a-a jealous monster.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.900
and that ended poorly.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.300
so then
you just got afraid

41:45.300 --> 41:48.100
and just tired of falling
for the wrong guy,

41:48.100 --> 41:50.800
which is why you've been
putting off marrying my brother.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.600
you're afraid.

41:55.400 --> 41:58.100
i...i have been afraid.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.700
wait a minute.

42:02.700 --> 42:04.400
did fritz tell you
about all that?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.900
