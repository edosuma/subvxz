WEBVTT

00:13.080 --> 00:15.596
I can't. I'm still working.

00:15.620 --> 00:17.166
Hey, this is my big week, man.

00:17.190 --> 00:20.046
I made more tips today
than all last month.

00:20.070 --> 00:22.196
Yeah, I got four more deliveries.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.626
Yeah, I'll hook up with you around 7:00.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.090
Yeah, whatever.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.366
I used to love this game as a kid.

01:28.390 --> 01:29.700
Oh, me, too.

01:29.730 --> 01:31.870
My mother preferred I played with dolls.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.736
My favorite was G.I.Joe.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.856
- David, thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:35.880 --> 01:39.280
I enjoy shopping... especially
when it's not my money.

01:44.460 --> 01:46.220
Good.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.166
That was security.

01:48.190 --> 01:50.236
A Detective Kemp is on his way up.

01:50.260 --> 01:51.316
Anyone know where Gibbs is?

01:51.340 --> 01:52.806
Detective Justin Kemp?

01:52.830 --> 01:55.366
That's the one. Metro
Homicide. Why, do you know him?

01:55.390 --> 01:58.010
Um, sort of... you know...

01:59.030 --> 02:00.396
What does that mean?

02:00.420 --> 02:02.810
We have a mutual friend.

02:04.070 --> 02:06.270
I used to date Kemp's wife.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.156
How, uh... how many dates
we talking about here?

02:10.180 --> 02:12.166
Guys, what's it matter? I don't know.

02:12.190 --> 02:15.186
Like two, or three?

02:15.210 --> 02:16.276
Four.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.406
- Oh, that's...
- Not a big deal.

02:17.430 --> 02:19.246
Four months. At least four months.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.806
- Oh, that is...
- That is a big deal.

02:20.830 --> 02:22.806
So what's Kemp doing here?

02:22.830 --> 02:24.930
Uh, investigating a
home invasion robbery.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.736
Double homicide...
It's an older couple.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.496
And how does that involve us?

02:28.520 --> 02:31.260
They don't want to
discuss it on the phone.

02:35.470 --> 02:38.490
Close your mouth, Ziva. He's married.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.800
- Kemp.
- DiNozzo.

02:42.390 --> 02:43.356
Special Agent Gibbs.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.596
Sorry to ruin your Christmas.

02:44.620 --> 02:47.840
It's December 23. We're
not going anywhere.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.836
Found fingerprints at the crime scene.

02:49.860 --> 02:52.926
Ran them through AFIS...
I got a hit... a Ned Quinn.

02:52.950 --> 02:55.576
A former petty officer. Vietnam vet.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.970
We had a witness...
A delivery boy.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.430
Worked with our sketch artist.

03:07.330 --> 03:10.566
Looks like an older version of... him.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.426
Can't be. Quinn died in a fire in 1991.

03:13.450 --> 03:14.500
That's why I'm here.

03:14.540 --> 03:16.846
According to V.A.records,
Quinn's buried at Arlington.

03:16.870 --> 03:19.680
McGee, pull a copy of
the death certificate.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.510
Boss, this is not good.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.326
It's a sixpence.

03:28.350 --> 03:29.786
What does it have to do with Christmas?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.866
Everything, Abby. It's a tradition.

03:31.890 --> 03:34.386
That coin has been baked,
well, steamed actually,

03:34.410 --> 03:37.956
into every Mallard Christmas
pudding since the 1850s.

03:37.980 --> 03:43.346
It brings good fortune and luck in the coming
year to whoever finds it on their plate.

03:43.370 --> 03:45.580
Assuming they don't
choke to death on it.

03:45.610 --> 03:51.036
Sadly, with no extended family
here, I've let the tradition lapse.

03:51.060 --> 03:55.490
Next year, Ducky, you and me... we're
going to make Christmas pudding.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.636
I'd like that.

03:56.660 --> 03:58.376
I like everything about Christmas.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.326
Except for that Chipmunk song.

04:00.350 --> 04:01.320
And shopping... I hate shopping.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.530
I never know what do get
anyone... specially Gibbs.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.276
What do you get for the guy that
has nothing and wants nothing?

04:06.300 --> 04:08.496
Some squeaky shoes.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.430
Hi, Gibbs!

04:11.690 --> 04:14.006
Bye, Gibbs.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.756
Something wrong, Jethro?

04:15.780 --> 04:18.796
Fingerprints found at a
double homicide yesterday...

04:18.820 --> 04:22.970
Belong to a petty officer who's
supposed to have been dead 17 years.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.186
His death certificate.

04:25.210 --> 04:29.140
Oh, dear. Someone's in trouble.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.750
I signed it?

04:43.520 --> 04:44.580
Ned Quinn.

04:44.610 --> 04:47.636
Graduated with honors from
the University of Virginia.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.856
He was accepted to its
medical school, but didn't go.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.496
Enlisted in the Navy.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.016
Became a corpsman instead.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.726
Attached to the First
Battalion, Ninth Marines.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.406
The walking dead.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.946
Came home from Vietnam in 1972.

04:59.970 --> 05:03.476
Was treated at V.A.for post
traumatic stress disorder.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.726
Quinn became addicted to methamphetamine
and was in and out of rehab.

05:06.750 --> 05:12.126
His wife divorced him in 1980, and got full
custody of their three-year-old daughter Melissa.

05:12.150 --> 05:16.226
He started living on the streets and
supposedly died with seven others in a fire

05:16.250 --> 05:18.086
at a halfway house on Canal Street.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.016
There was nothing to hint that Quinn
was alive until yesterday's murders.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.806
A lot of years in between.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.726
Where's the ex-wife
and the daughter now?

05:24.750 --> 05:28.036
Wife lives in Alexandria and
the daughter lives in Clearfield.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.920
McGee, go with her.

05:31.070 --> 05:32.460
Massive charring.

05:32.510 --> 05:34.956
Pugilistic contractions
of the extremities.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.806
Heat fractions.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.146
Evulsion of the brain...

05:38.170 --> 05:40.036
large and small intestines.

05:40.060 --> 05:43.976
My voice had a deeper
timbre in those days.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.720
You make a mistake, Duck?

05:47.430 --> 05:52.686
The city M.E.was unable to make a positive
identification from the charred remains.

05:52.710 --> 05:56.256
So I was called in in the hope
that Quinn's military medical

05:56.280 --> 05:59.010
and dental records could
confirm his identity.

05:59.040 --> 06:03.806
Unfortunately, due to the victim's heavy
drug use, he suffered from meth mouth.

06:03.830 --> 06:08.826
Which deteriorated his teeth and
made a dental match impossible.

06:08.850 --> 06:09.630
DNA?

06:09.660 --> 06:11.796
That was not an option back then.

06:11.820 --> 06:15.980
All I had to go by was an examination of
the skull and measurement of the bones.

06:16.010 --> 06:18.916
From which I determined
only that it was a male,

06:18.940 --> 06:23.176
Caucasian, about 40 years
old and six-foot, two.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.160
Well, fit Quinn's description then.

06:25.190 --> 06:29.876
And since the remains were found in Quinn's
room with all of Quinn's personal effects,

06:29.900 --> 06:34.426
we both naturally reached a
circumstantial and logical conclusion.

06:34.450 --> 06:38.630
What's more, nobody turned
up claiming to be Quinn.

06:38.660 --> 06:43.040
Well, if it wasn't him,

06:43.560 --> 06:48.120
then maybe he killed someone
and covered it up with the fire.

06:48.150 --> 06:53.356
In Quinn's file, it says that he was
treated for his PTSD at Bethesda.

06:53.380 --> 06:57.426
By a psychiatrist... one Dr..

06:57.450 --> 07:01.426
Dr. Pryor. Yes. As I
recall, he's still there.

07:01.450 --> 07:04.100
I need to talk to him.

07:07.660 --> 07:08.716
Thanks for coming over, Mom.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.356
I just have to get a
few stocking stuffers.

07:10.380 --> 07:11.366
Go, go, go, go.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.376
As long as I'm home by 6:30 to
help your father brine the turkey.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.066
You know how he gets.

07:16.090 --> 07:17.926
Have you seen my car keys?

07:17.950 --> 07:19.936
Jordie, did you take my keys?

07:19.960 --> 07:21.686
I'll get it. Hang on, hang on.

07:21.710 --> 07:24.190
You stay here, my sweet boy.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.286
Afternoon. NCIS.

07:27.310 --> 07:30.520
I'm Special Agent Timothy
McGee looking for Melissa Fox.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.040
Who is it, Mom?

07:33.750 --> 07:35.066
Are you Connie Wheeler?

07:35.090 --> 07:36.356
Yes.

07:36.380 --> 07:40.370
We need to ask you some questions
about your former husband, Ned Quinn.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.266
Fingerprints found at
a crime scene match his.

07:44.290 --> 07:47.316
Well, that can't be.

07:47.340 --> 07:49.536
He's been dead for 20 years.

07:49.560 --> 07:54.060
If he were alive, do you have
any idea where he might be?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.026
I couldn't even offer a clue.

07:58.050 --> 08:01.876
He's been out of our
lives since the divorce.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.266
Melissa, have you had any
contact with your father?

08:04.290 --> 08:08.086
Her father is my husband Ed.

08:08.110 --> 08:10.676
He raised Melissa since
she was four years old.

08:10.700 --> 08:14.076
Ned Quinn has never
been a part of her life.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.386
I only have vague memories of him.

08:16.410 --> 08:19.910
If he is still alive, I don't
want him to know where we are.

08:19.950 --> 08:22.156
He's already destroyed our lives once.

08:22.180 --> 08:24.860
- Mommy, Mommy, I'm done.
- I'm sorry, excuse me.

08:29.890 --> 08:33.240
When he came back from Vietnam...

08:36.210 --> 08:38.626
he was a drug addict.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.895
I tried, but he didn't want my help.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.306
I moved on.

08:44.330 --> 08:47.086
We both moved on.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.070
I don't remember Quinn.

08:49.110 --> 08:54.026
Apparently we treated him over a
three year period... 1979 to '82.

08:54.050 --> 08:56.046
What were you treating him for?

08:56.070 --> 08:58.180
He suffered from survivor guilt.

08:58.210 --> 09:00.566
Blamed himself for a buddy's death.

09:00.590 --> 09:02.030
Oh, my God.

09:02.060 --> 09:04.356
I heard there was a
Santa in the building.

09:04.380 --> 09:06.716
- Abby...
- He's great.

09:06.740 --> 09:09.746
Rosy cheeks, wire-rim glasses.

09:09.770 --> 09:11.486
Your beard looks so real...

09:11.510 --> 09:12.996
That's because it is.

09:13.020 --> 09:17.066
Abigail, Dr. Pryor is a
psychiatrist. He's here to help me find...

09:17.090 --> 09:20.276
To find out who's naughty
and who's nice. Hello?

09:20.300 --> 09:22.470
You think I could get a picture?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.150
Abigail.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.746
Why did Quinn blame himself
for his friend's death?

09:27.770 --> 09:33.216
Well, he and another corpsman switched
patrols a week before their tour was to end.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.640
The other guy got killed in an ambush.

09:35.670 --> 09:39.156
You last saw him in
'82. The fire was in '91.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.786
Have you any idea of anything that
happened in the intervening years?

09:42.810 --> 09:45.606
No. Like a lot of those
guys, he stopped coming.

09:45.630 --> 09:46.730
They give up.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.946
Did he have any violent tendencies?

09:48.970 --> 09:50.326
I don't remember.

09:50.350 --> 09:53.926
I have to be at the Children's
Hospital party in 30 minutes.

09:53.950 --> 09:58.176
Anything that I once knew
about the man is in here.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.680
Thank you, Dr. Pryor.

10:03.050 --> 10:06.190
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

10:07.410 --> 10:09.660
Thank you, Santa.

10:12.510 --> 10:18.246
I just suffered for hours through
the good doctor's rambling notes.

10:18.270 --> 10:22.390
There is nothing to suggest
aggressive or impulsive behavior.

10:22.420 --> 10:28.096
Per his service record, Quinn
left Vietnam on December 30, 1972.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.016
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall
listed 58,000 plus names of the dead

10:32.040 --> 10:33.876
and missing in chronological order.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.186
According to its Web site, 17
military personnel died that week.

10:37.210 --> 10:41.020
Of that number, two were in Long Khanh
Province where Quinn was stationed.

10:41.050 --> 10:43.110
Only one was a Navy corpsman.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.196
Roger Laurence Grant.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.686
Yeah.

10:46.710 --> 10:49.520
After the Vietnam
Memorial was dedicated,

10:49.550 --> 10:54.080
Quinn went regularly to the wall
to pay tribute to his fallen friend.

10:54.110 --> 10:55.806
If Quinn is still alive,

10:55.830 --> 11:00.846
there's a chance he might
honor Roger Grant's memory

11:00.870 --> 11:06.660
by visiting the Memorial on the
anniversary of his death... December 24.

11:08.470 --> 11:10.850
Tomorrow.

11:11.340 --> 11:13.786
- He does not dress like a cop.
- Who?

11:13.810 --> 11:15.686
Your Detective Kemp.

11:15.710 --> 11:18.956
You are a little fascinated by him.

11:18.980 --> 11:20.926
- He come from money?
- Married it.

11:20.950 --> 11:22.656
We're missing the
office Christmas party.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.746
That could have been you.

11:24.770 --> 11:26.666
- What is her name?
- Guy in the blue hoodie.

11:26.690 --> 11:27.866
Could be Quinn.

11:27.890 --> 11:29.750
Go check him out.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.746
Too young, too fat, too female.

11:33.770 --> 11:36.460
Answer my question. She pretty?

11:36.740 --> 11:39.080
Gorgeous.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.520
She was perfect, okay?

11:43.150 --> 11:45.776
Witty, smart.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.606
That was 12 years ago.

11:46.630 --> 11:49.780
She's had kids; God knows
what she looks like now.

11:52.310 --> 11:56.110
So... what happened?

11:59.110 --> 12:02.750
You ever, um, regret...

12:03.510 --> 12:07.590
not having a wife and kids?

12:08.170 --> 12:11.026
Especially during this time of year.

12:11.050 --> 12:12.846
Hanukkah is all about family.

12:12.870 --> 12:16.530
Is it not the same with Christmas?

12:17.960 --> 12:21.376
I'm gonna check out the
guy in the blue hoodie.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.416
It is a woman!

12:23.440 --> 12:26.846
Hey, Gibbs. The party's
starting to wind down up there.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.966
Hollander had to be sent home
in a cab... fourth year in a row.

12:29.990 --> 12:32.380
I brought you and McGee some eggnog.

12:33.330 --> 12:36.280
Right. Two for McGee.

12:36.860 --> 12:39.156
Speaking of McGee...

12:39.180 --> 12:41.496
and Ziva... and Tony...

12:41.520 --> 12:45.686
Abs, it's Christmas Eve. Go home.

12:45.710 --> 12:47.616
I can't. I have to go shopping.

12:47.640 --> 12:48.526
Then do it.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.066
I don't know what to get anybody.

12:50.090 --> 12:51.666
What do you think Tony needs?

12:51.690 --> 12:52.926
An attitude adjustment.

12:52.950 --> 12:55.366
Gibbs, you're not helping.

12:55.390 --> 12:57.330
Right this way, please.

12:59.430 --> 13:03.110
Abs. Merry Christmas.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.126
Boss, this is Melissa
Fox, Ned Quinn's daughter.

13:08.150 --> 13:09.916
Melissa, this is Special Agent Gibbs.

13:09.940 --> 13:12.190
He's in charge of the case.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.860
Thank you for seeing me, Agent Gibbs.

13:22.050 --> 13:27.330
I just wanted to make it clear
that my mother doesn't speak for me.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.030
She wants no part of my father.

13:32.350 --> 13:34.106
I do.

13:34.130 --> 13:38.310
I have all these
childhood memories of him.

13:38.740 --> 13:41.920
Maybe they're just fantasies, but...

13:42.240 --> 13:47.320
Don't get me wrong. My
stepfather is wonderful.

13:48.110 --> 13:53.790
But I hoped one day to connect
with my biological father.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.706
Did you try?

13:56.730 --> 13:59.876
My mother protected me from him.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.776
She didn't even tell me when he died.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.426
How'd you find out?

14:04.450 --> 14:07.210
I did a search when I was 21.

14:08.310 --> 14:11.246
Excuse me. Yeah.

14:11.270 --> 14:13.286
He's here. Should we take him down?

14:13.310 --> 14:16.550
No. I'm on my way. Thanks.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.356
Sorry about that.

14:20.380 --> 14:24.640
I'm still reeling from the
possibility that he might be alive.

14:27.150 --> 14:32.610
Unlike my mother, I'd
very much like to see him.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.240
It's like a piece of me is missing.

15:04.650 --> 15:09.960
No matter how many times I
come here, it still gets to me.

15:14.720 --> 15:21.090
You look at a name, you have to
look at a reflection of yourself.

15:25.110 --> 15:28.030
You are among the fallen.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.626
Yeah.

15:31.650 --> 15:35.010
Difference is you can leave...

15:35.820 --> 15:38.420
the names don't.

15:40.710 --> 15:42.620
No.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.996
Death is permanent.

15:46.020 --> 15:50.730
Except in your case, Ned Quinn.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.810
It's been a long time since
anybody's called me that.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.506
He hasn't said a word since
we brought him in here.

16:12.530 --> 16:16.326
Not surprising for a man
who spent 17 years hiding.

16:16.350 --> 16:20.556
Skin and eyes clear,
good hygiene, no tremors.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.626
Clean and sober.

16:22.650 --> 16:28.130
All he had on him was eight dollars and a key
to a long-term downtown hotel room. No ID.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.010
Metro P.D.is on the way to pick you up.

16:39.350 --> 16:42.050
You'll be their problem.

16:46.550 --> 16:50.050
That's your buddy. Petty Officer Grant.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.416
Corpsman.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.800
Just like you.

16:59.340 --> 17:02.970
Corpsman saved my life once.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.430
So you're a former Marine, huh?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.236
So what happened at
the Taylor house then?

17:15.260 --> 17:18.470
Your fingerprints were
all over the place.

17:18.510 --> 17:20.996
I didn't kill them.

17:21.020 --> 17:23.490
You were there.

17:23.849 --> 17:25.396
Why?

17:25.420 --> 17:29.966
I was out on the street with my sign, looking
for work, and the Taylors picked me up.

17:29.990 --> 17:35.506
They needed help decorating
their house for the holidays.

17:35.530 --> 17:36.806
You never met them before?

17:36.830 --> 17:43.000
No, they said it was their traditional way of
extending a helping hand to those less fortunate.

17:44.340 --> 17:47.260
Well, if you didn't kill them, who did?

17:48.170 --> 17:50.416
I don't know.

17:50.440 --> 17:56.156
I was in the garage. I was
digging decorations out of boxes.

17:56.180 --> 17:59.826
When I got back, I found them.

17:59.850 --> 18:01.856
There was blood everywhere.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.876
The husband was already dead.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.986
The wife was on the couch.

18:06.010 --> 18:09.116
I put her on the floor,
I tried to administer CPR.

18:09.140 --> 18:11.426
But it was too late.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.396
- I'll be back.
- Where you going?

18:13.420 --> 18:16.386
I want to catch the city
M.E.before he leaves his office.

18:16.410 --> 18:18.610
Wish me luck.

18:19.580 --> 18:21.960
Why'd you run?

18:23.480 --> 18:26.146
I'd been dead for 17 years.

18:26.170 --> 18:29.300
Who's gonna believe me?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.396
How long has Quinn lived here?

18:32.420 --> 18:34.360
Who?

18:34.590 --> 18:37.650
The guy in this room. Rembrandt?

18:41.470 --> 18:42.976
I've been here 12 years.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.516
He's been here longer than that.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.766
Rembrandt ever give you any trouble?

18:46.790 --> 18:51.476
Never. Pays his rent every
Saturday, in cash. Keeps to himself.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.360
All right.

18:53.390 --> 18:58.146
We'll say good-bye to you
downstairs. Bye. Downstairs. Thanks.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.690
Wow, guy's got some personality.

19:09.530 --> 19:12.480
Check this out.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.686
That's pretty good.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.216
Not what I expected to find.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.536
Not what I expected to
be doing on Christmas Eve.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.630
- What did you expect to be doing?
- Not this.

19:23.180 --> 19:24.456
You had no plans.

19:24.480 --> 19:29.880
I had plans. I had big
plans. Big, big plans.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.916
I was ten blocks away
when the fire broke out.

19:34.940 --> 19:38.096
So who died in your room?

19:38.120 --> 19:41.016
Another tweaker.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.156
I didn't know him.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.596
He told me where I could cop.

19:44.620 --> 19:47.486
I told him he could crash
there till I got back.

19:47.510 --> 19:53.080
When I did, there were fire engines
and cop cars all over the place.

19:53.330 --> 19:56.680
Why didn't you just identify yourself?

19:57.140 --> 20:00.916
I realized they thought
I was in the room.

20:00.940 --> 20:06.490
And in a rare, lucid moment, it occurred
to me that my ex-wife and my daughter

20:07.310 --> 20:14.140
might be better off if I was dead and
they could receive my military benefits.

20:16.280 --> 20:19.846
That was the only decent
thing I ever did for them.

20:19.870 --> 20:23.526
So you disappeared. You hid.

20:23.550 --> 20:26.640
It's not hard if no
one's looking for you.

20:26.700 --> 20:32.546
You work for cash, you pay cash for
what you buy, you don't need a name.

20:32.570 --> 20:34.286
- Ziva.
- Did you leave D.C.?

20:34.310 --> 20:37.530
Thought about it, but never did.

20:38.850 --> 20:40.516
Abby, I thought you went home.

20:40.540 --> 20:44.076
Did Gibbs tell him that his daughter
was here and she wants to meet him?

20:44.100 --> 20:47.156
- No.
- He has to. It means everything to her.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.896
Abby, this is not a lost
puppy for you to rescue.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.256
You cannot make this better.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.526
This is a murder investigation.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.900
I think Gibbs should tell him.

20:54.930 --> 20:59.280
And I think... you
should stay out of this.

21:00.630 --> 21:03.006
Missed the party, don't
have to miss the food.

21:03.030 --> 21:06.666
Hey, Ducky, I found these in the
conference room. They're pretty de-lish.

21:06.690 --> 21:09.730
You might want to try some of
this, Ducky. It's pretty good stuff.

21:10.140 --> 21:11.466
No, thank you.

21:11.490 --> 21:13.766
- What'd you find out at his place?
- Nothing to tie him to the murders.

21:13.790 --> 21:17.676
Appears to have led
a, uh, non-criminal and invisible life.

21:17.700 --> 21:21.146
Actually, uh, he's an artist...
Sketches. Pretty good stuff.

21:21.170 --> 21:22.676
- You catch the M.E.?
- Yes.

21:22.700 --> 21:28.306
Mr. Taylor died of blunt force trauma to the head
from what appears to be several strikes of a hammer.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.476
Mrs. Taylor, heart attack.

21:30.500 --> 21:34.600
Uh, ligature marks on her wrists suggest
that she was restrained by handcuffs.

21:34.630 --> 21:39.426
But what is much more interesting:
Our suspect is telling the truth.

21:39.450 --> 21:41.886
He was trying to save Mrs. Taylor.

21:41.910 --> 21:42.726
How do you know that?

21:42.750 --> 21:45.966
Quinn's bloody fingerprints
knew what they were doing.

21:45.990 --> 21:52.150
And compression bruises on her chest suggest
he was trying to perform CPR, Jethro.

21:52.180 --> 21:55.940
And he knew to put her on
a hard surface, the floor.

21:56.050 --> 21:56.820
Yeah.

21:56.850 --> 22:00.006
Kill the husband, try and save
the wife? Doesn't make sense.

22:00.030 --> 22:01.396
Kemp's here to pick up Quinn.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.520
I will go get him.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.456
Keep him here till I get back.

22:06.480 --> 22:09.570
How can he eat those things?

22:12.160 --> 22:14.290
Yeah?

22:15.550 --> 22:17.806
Nice work finding Quinn so fast.

22:17.830 --> 22:20.526
Well, I got a lot of help from Ducky.

22:20.550 --> 22:23.536
Same guy that declared
him dead 17 years ago.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.200
Well, Jackie is furious.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.826
I was supposed to be home hours ago.

22:28.850 --> 22:32.790
All right, time to start
the Christmas holiday.

22:36.230 --> 22:39.666
You're not here to wish me
a merry Christmas, are you?

22:39.690 --> 22:42.166
I can't get a handle on Quinn.

22:42.190 --> 22:45.636
He faked his own death and we
can place him at the crime scene.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.476
But you don't think he did it?

22:47.500 --> 22:51.386
I think we may be handing
over an innocent man to Metro.

22:51.410 --> 22:53.246
And you're concerned they think
they've got a slam-dunk case.

22:53.270 --> 22:56.210
They're not gonna look any further.

23:00.380 --> 23:04.346
This was taken last Christmas.

23:04.370 --> 23:06.060
Is that your wife?

23:07.440 --> 23:10.396
Nobody looks that good in
a bikini after two kids.

23:10.420 --> 23:12.696
That hotel is awesome.
Is that a Ritz-Carlton?

23:12.720 --> 23:16.750
No, no, that's, uh, that's
my father-in-law's villa.

23:17.820 --> 23:21.776
So, uh, where's Gibbs? I
need to get Quinn downtown.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.676
We're gonna hold him
here, Detective Kemp.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.966
- Leon Vance.
- Director.

23:26.990 --> 23:30.306
The Navy's got unfinished business
with former Petty Officer Quinn.

23:30.330 --> 23:32.456
What exactly?

23:32.480 --> 23:33.736
Faked his death.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.596
His family collected death benefits.

23:35.620 --> 23:38.386
With all due respect, Director,
I've got him for a double homicide.

23:38.410 --> 23:39.326
Not even close.

23:39.350 --> 23:42.136
You know you won't be able to get
Quinn in front of a judge for days.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.220
Relax. Enjoy a little family time.

23:45.770 --> 23:47.806
What am I missing?

23:47.830 --> 23:51.290
Why is NCIS interfering
with a Metro case?

23:52.460 --> 23:55.126
Fine. Tomorrow's Christmas.

23:55.150 --> 23:57.366
I've got two bikes and a
dollhouse to put together.

23:57.390 --> 24:00.910
We'll be back with a court
order day after tomorrow.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.266
Let's go.

24:03.290 --> 24:07.170
You asked for it. You better
work fast. You only have a day.

24:07.810 --> 24:08.966
Merry Christmas.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.926
Hey, guys. What's up?

24:10.950 --> 24:13.940
I hope no one has plans.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.136
Keep Quinn in interrogation.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.456
We'll watch him in shifts.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.726
What do I do?

24:31.750 --> 24:35.326
You and Duck go home.
It's late. Get some sleep.

24:35.350 --> 24:38.196
Oh, I haven't slept on Christmas
Eve since I was, like, four.

24:38.220 --> 24:41.686
Since I started camping out in front
of the fireplace trying to catch Santa.

24:41.710 --> 24:44.496
I should have pulled a
fingerprint off his milk glass.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.456
I may need you both tomorrow.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.606
Yes, I have to go visit
Mother in her new home.

24:49.630 --> 24:52.206
May I walk you to your car?

24:52.230 --> 24:53.146
How is she?

24:53.170 --> 24:55.196
Driving the nurses crazy.

24:55.220 --> 24:57.140
Kemp Is focused on Quinn's fingerprints.

24:57.170 --> 24:59.116
He's not looking at anything else.

24:59.140 --> 25:00.556
Do our own investigation.

25:00.580 --> 25:01.646
Visit the crime scene?

25:01.670 --> 25:02.826
Kemp will go ballistic.

25:02.850 --> 25:05.770
Boss, I Googled the dead couple
for background information.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.526
Found something interesting here.

25:07.550 --> 25:09.620
Six months ago, the
husband, Avery Taylor,

25:09.650 --> 25:14.926
filed a multimillion-dollar patent-infringement
lawsuit against Paradigm Industries.

25:14.950 --> 25:17.416
- Get out of town.
- What?

25:17.440 --> 25:21.286
Paradigm Industries is
owned by Gary Vanderlicht.

25:21.310 --> 25:25.040
Metro Detective Justin Kemp's
filthy-rich father-in-law?

25:34.060 --> 25:36.396
All right, that's it.
I know when I'm beaten.

25:36.420 --> 25:40.466
How are we going to get the game back in the
box and make it look like it was never opened?

25:40.490 --> 25:44.290
I am an expert at
repacking and rewrapping.

25:44.320 --> 25:48.356
Christmas mornings, I knew what
was in each present under the tree.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.610
You peeked?

25:50.640 --> 25:52.586
Is anybody in there?

25:52.610 --> 25:55.030
Agent Gibbs?

26:00.750 --> 26:03.666
When are the police
coming to pick me up?

26:03.690 --> 26:05.406
Not for a while.

26:05.430 --> 26:08.940
Because of the holiday,
shifts are not fully staffed.

26:09.470 --> 26:13.010
I think you know more
than you're telling me.

26:13.570 --> 26:15.436
Are you hungry?

26:15.460 --> 26:18.000
Do you need anything?

26:19.230 --> 26:21.686
A pencil and paper.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.540
I can't sleep.

26:23.570 --> 26:26.480
Sketching relaxes me.

26:26.930 --> 26:31.050
Oh, yeah, I know, sharp object.

26:31.750 --> 26:35.440
I promise I won't stab myself.

26:41.010 --> 26:43.960
Not a happy Christmas
morning for the Taylors.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.086
Hey, wanna make this interesting?

26:46.110 --> 26:50.316
I bet you five bucks I can crack the alarm
code before you can pick the lock, boss.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.540
- I will take that bet.
- Okay.

26:55.010 --> 26:56.726
Ta-da!

26:56.750 --> 26:58.056
How did you do that?

26:58.080 --> 27:00.426
The one, the four, theeven
and the nine are worn.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.446
The code had to be a combination
of those four numbers.

27:02.470 --> 27:04.596
People like to choose numbers
that are easy to rember:

27:04.620 --> 27:07.186
Address, anniversary,
birthday, birth year.

27:07.210 --> 27:10.106
Being a Boy Scout, I came prepared.

27:10.130 --> 27:13.690
The Taylors were born in 1947.

27:14.910 --> 27:16.880
Five bucks.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.470
Sore loser.

27:30.380 --> 27:31.860
What do we think the police missed?

27:31.890 --> 27:36.896
If we believe Quinn, he found the wife's
body on the couch and moved it on the floor.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.586
They wouldn't have known that.

27:38.610 --> 27:39.880
Got it.

27:39.910 --> 27:43.846
Kemp's investigation focused on the
fingerprint evidence and the couple's bodies,

27:43.870 --> 27:46.956
which were found here and here.

27:46.980 --> 27:49.950
Let's check out the rest of the house.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.016
That's good.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.300
So were the sketches in your room.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.820
Did you take art classes in college?

28:02.250 --> 28:05.880
No. Rehab.

28:08.050 --> 28:13.240
I guess being pre-med, you don't really
have a lot of time to take electives.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.940
You wanted to be a doctor.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.430
'Nam changed things.

28:26.150 --> 28:28.176
Looks like a chair was moved.

28:28.200 --> 28:32.580
Found fibers, hair
and... Watch! A button.

28:36.050 --> 28:38.110
Found the chair.

28:39.540 --> 28:43.250
Looks like somebody wanted to
get something on the upper shelf.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.396
It's a safe. It's empty.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.306
I'm guessing Metro police got it wrong.

28:49.330 --> 28:53.150
The robbery netted more than just the jewelry
the wife was wearing and the husband's cash.

28:53.180 --> 28:56.230
- Dust it.
- Security patrol.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.276
Uh, who are you guys?

29:02.300 --> 29:04.506
NCIS.

29:04.530 --> 29:06.730
We received an alarm.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.616
I thought you turned it off?

29:08.640 --> 29:10.916
It's our top-of-the-line
HS 3000 system.

29:10.940 --> 29:12.416
It's a double-redundant.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.826
If you don't punch in the code
twice, it sends a silent alarm.

29:15.850 --> 29:17.820
Double redundancy,
how could I know that?

29:17.860 --> 29:20.726
Thought the police, uh, had a suspect.

29:20.750 --> 29:21.696
What are you guys doing here?

29:21.720 --> 29:23.306
They asked for our help.

29:23.330 --> 29:24.846
They didn't tell us.

29:24.870 --> 29:27.266
We got work to do.

29:27.290 --> 29:31.176
NCIS... heard about you guys.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.566
I've been in the private
security business for three years.

29:34.590 --> 29:37.176
Doesn't pay very well.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.200
Does NCIS take applications?

29:44.000 --> 29:44.996
Abby...

29:45.020 --> 29:46.726
Merry Christmas, Tiny Tim!

29:46.750 --> 29:47.626
What are you doing here?

29:47.650 --> 29:49.696
Well, today's Christmas.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.196
I just came from church.

29:51.220 --> 29:55.246
I didn't have anything planned
and I wanted to be with my team.

29:55.270 --> 29:56.766
Where is everybody?

29:56.790 --> 29:59.266
In the field.

29:59.290 --> 30:01.516
- How's he doin'?
- Ah, you know.

30:01.540 --> 30:05.166
Has he, um, mentioned his daughter?

30:05.190 --> 30:07.080
No.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.656
You think he'd like to see her?

30:09.680 --> 30:12.120
I don't know. Why are you asking?

30:13.770 --> 30:18.086
Because Melissa's in the
lobby and she wants to see him.

30:18.110 --> 30:20.370
How did she know that we found him?

30:20.400 --> 30:25.190
Well, she might have figured it
out when I called her and told her.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.846
Abby, what, what are you
doing? You called her?

30:27.870 --> 30:30.016
Gibbs, Gibbs is gonna kill you!

30:30.040 --> 30:31.686
No, he won't.

30:31.710 --> 30:33.596
Think about it, Tim.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.746
This is the greatest fairy tale ever.

30:35.770 --> 30:38.650
There's a little girl
and her dad leaves.

30:38.690 --> 30:40.566
And then he lives on the streets.

30:40.590 --> 30:42.156
And then he dies.

30:42.180 --> 30:44.246
And she's never gonna see him again.

30:44.270 --> 30:50.026
She's never gonna get to say all the things
that a daughter wants to say to her father.

30:50.050 --> 30:53.340
And then she grows up and
she has a child of her own,

30:53.370 --> 30:57.210
and then wonder of all wonders,

30:57.240 --> 31:01.740
he comes back from the dead
and they get reunited...

31:02.160 --> 31:04.926
on Christmas!

31:04.950 --> 31:06.136
Abby, are you finished?

31:06.160 --> 31:09.170
Please, please, please, pretty please?

31:09.200 --> 31:10.756
Do it for me, okay?

31:10.780 --> 31:14.336
Just, just tell him Melissa's here.

31:14.360 --> 31:18.410
You'll understand when you
see the sparkle in his eye.

31:20.180 --> 31:22.010
All right.

31:29.410 --> 31:31.620
You have a visitor.

31:32.830 --> 31:33.880
Who?

31:33.910 --> 31:36.640
Melissa, your daughter.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.656
- She's here?
- Yep.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.930
Wants to talk to you.

31:47.190 --> 31:49.466
I don't want to see her.

31:49.490 --> 31:53.280
And you tell her that she was
better off when I was dead.

31:54.970 --> 31:56.880
Okay.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.826
Here, let me, let me help you with that.

32:07.850 --> 32:10.006
Got it. Thanks.

32:10.030 --> 32:11.966
So how'd you hook up with NCIS?

32:11.990 --> 32:15.080
See if DiNozzo is
finished in the garage.

32:15.990 --> 32:17.726
She's cute.

32:17.750 --> 32:20.526
So, maybe I could, uh, you know...

32:20.550 --> 32:24.160
Well, good luck with the case.

32:29.130 --> 32:32.040
Think we just got a Christmas present.

32:33.970 --> 32:35.496
What the hell is going on?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.666
Metro Police Chief
just gave me an earful.

32:37.690 --> 32:40.826
Claims you broke into their crime scene
and corrupted the chain of evidence.

32:40.850 --> 32:42.686
Tell me you didn't do that.

32:42.710 --> 32:43.596
How'd he find out?

32:43.620 --> 32:45.506
Metro got a call from
the home-security firm.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.076
Come on, Daddy!

32:47.100 --> 32:48.646
This how you spend your Christmas, Gibbs?

32:48.670 --> 32:50.416
Most people are home opening presents.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.320
Yeah, most people.

32:52.350 --> 32:54.766
Cops are on their way to pick up Quinn.

32:54.790 --> 32:57.450
- Leon, we're late.
- Get him ready.

32:58.740 --> 33:01.496
- Hey, Gibbs.
- Looks like we got the murder weapon.

33:01.520 --> 33:04.896
Blood on the hammer
matches the victim's type.

33:04.920 --> 33:07.136
You're not gonna like this, Gibbs.

33:07.160 --> 33:11.380
The prints on the handle
belong to the victim.

33:11.660 --> 33:14.160
And to Ned Quinn.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.746
It looks like mine.

33:36.770 --> 33:38.066
Your prints are on it.

33:38.090 --> 33:42.246
Look, the Taylors hired me to
help them decorate their house.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.626
I brought my toolbox.

33:44.650 --> 33:47.946
When I left, I was in a hurry.

33:47.970 --> 33:51.500
I didn't stop to see
if I brought my hammer.

33:52.850 --> 33:56.226
You said you were in their garage.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.566
That's where the hammer was found.

33:57.590 --> 34:01.270
I don't know how it got... What
do you want me to tell you?

34:03.410 --> 34:06.786
You know, you're getting
harder and harder to believe.

34:06.810 --> 34:08.389
Right, Sherlock.

34:08.429 --> 34:11.686
Vietnam Vet, stoner, a man with no name.

34:11.710 --> 34:14.420
It's got to be me.

34:17.610 --> 34:20.136
Metro police are here.

34:20.159 --> 34:23.210
I will have McGee bring you down.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.356
You make it a habit,
keeping people waiting?

34:34.380 --> 34:37.476
- What's the rush, Kemp?
- It's Christmas.

34:37.500 --> 34:40.159
Maybe if you had a family,
DiNozzo, you'd understand.

34:40.730 --> 34:43.786
How did your daughter
like the dollhouse?

34:43.810 --> 34:45.166
Oh, she loved it.

34:45.190 --> 34:47.840
Yeah, she took it with her
when she left this morning.

34:47.870 --> 34:48.946
Where did she go?

34:48.969 --> 34:50.216
A family tradition.

34:50.239 --> 34:53.050
Yeah, we spend the week between
Christmas and New Year's at the villa.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.376
Yeah, right now they're
on my father-in-law's G5.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.666
Thanks to you guys, the Chief's
on my ass, wouldn't let me leave.

34:58.690 --> 35:00.636
And if I'm lucky I'm getting
out of here late tonight.

35:00.660 --> 35:03.960
Well, I really feel for
you, Kemp. Life's tough.

35:06.350 --> 35:08.216
- Where's Quinn?
- On the way.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.370
You gonna explain to me why
you broke into the crime scene?

35:13.650 --> 35:17.176
Are you gonna explain to me why you
didn't remove yourself from this case?

35:17.200 --> 35:18.436
Why would I do that?

35:18.460 --> 35:20.950
Avery Taylor was suing
your father-in-law.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.586
You have no business
investigating Taylor's murder.

35:23.610 --> 35:24.690
What are you talking about?

35:24.720 --> 35:28.290
Paradigm Industries? A little
case of patent-infringement?

35:29.430 --> 35:31.576
All right, let me tell
you a couple things.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.270
Okay, one: My father-in-law is
the CEO of a holding company

35:35.300 --> 35:37.706
that owns over a dozen
multimillion-dollar companies.

35:37.730 --> 35:41.250
And two: He never
discusses business with me.

35:42.530 --> 35:45.200
I don't like what you're insinuating.

35:47.950 --> 35:50.830
- He's all yours.
- Are you going to tell him we found the murder weapon?

35:51.400 --> 35:53.230
He never asked.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.580
Ah, thanks, I was running on empty.

35:59.300 --> 36:02.100
Oh, yuck!

36:02.380 --> 36:04.836
They put nutmeg in it for the holidays.

36:04.860 --> 36:05.926
What do you got, Abs?

36:05.950 --> 36:10.046
Um, the hair on the couch
belonged to Mrs. Taylor.

36:10.070 --> 36:11.446
I'm still working on the fibers.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.186
As for the button Ziva found,

36:13.210 --> 36:18.476
it was made exclusively for a clothing
manufacturer in Scranton, Pennsylvania,

36:18.500 --> 36:23.196
who specializes exclusively in
military and police uniforms.

36:23.220 --> 36:26.540
Dusting the safe
produced an unknown print.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.020
Mistletoe.

36:37.330 --> 36:39.186
******

36:39.210 --> 36:40.976
No.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.346
I didn't say it was a fingerprint.

36:42.370 --> 36:43.536
Well, what was it, Abby?

36:43.560 --> 36:45.116
It was a fabric print.

36:45.140 --> 36:48.466
Most likely made from a
glove. Should've worn latex.

36:48.490 --> 36:52.640
Leather and fabric gloves have a distinct
weave, grain, wear and stitching pattern.

36:52.670 --> 36:56.990
In this case, an old leather one
with U-shaped scuff and a frayed seam.

36:57.020 --> 37:00.936
You bring me a glove, and I'll tell
you if it left a print on the safe.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.886
You might've redeemed yourself, Abs.

37:03.910 --> 37:05.476
What'd I do?

37:05.500 --> 37:08.070
Called Quinn's daughter. McGee!

37:12.850 --> 37:14.296
Got it, Boss.

37:14.320 --> 37:18.746
Taylors' home-security system interfaces with
the company's central dispatch via the internet.

37:18.770 --> 37:19.876
Your hunch was right.

37:19.900 --> 37:23.236
The alarm was deactivated
at 2:17 AM this morning.

37:23.260 --> 37:25.586
Between the time Kemp
sealed the house and you...

37:25.610 --> 37:27.226
Broke in.

37:27.250 --> 37:31.070
Well, I was gonna say
gained unauthorized access.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.990
Alarm was reactivated four
and a half minutes later.

37:34.020 --> 37:36.350
DiNozzo, call your
ex-girlfriend's husband.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.986
Have him meet us at the Taylors'.

37:38.010 --> 37:39.146
Ziva, get the car.

37:39.170 --> 37:41.910
How about Ziva makes the
call and I get the car?

37:42.260 --> 37:45.150
Or not. I'll do it.

37:54.650 --> 37:56.906
You guys really don't have lives, do you?

37:56.930 --> 37:58.796
What are we doing here?

37:58.820 --> 38:00.686
Arresting the murder.

38:00.710 --> 38:03.046
He's in a holding cell, downtown, Gibbs.

38:03.070 --> 38:04.216
What is it with you people?

38:04.240 --> 38:07.296
First you declare him dead and now you're
trying to help him beat a double-homicide rap?

38:07.320 --> 38:08.986
This was a home invasion.

38:09.010 --> 38:11.526
But not for the wife's
jewelry or pocket change.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.486
It was all about the safe.

38:13.510 --> 38:16.620
- DiNozzo, break in.
- With great pleasure, sir.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.626
What safe?

38:20.650 --> 38:22.576
I guess you missed this.

38:22.600 --> 38:26.146
Okay. So, what? It was Quinn.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.096
His bloody prints were
all over the place.

38:28.120 --> 38:30.606
Yeah, because he was trying
to save the couple's lives.

38:30.630 --> 38:32.896
He was in the garage at
the time of the murders.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.730
Last night, while Quinn
was in our custody,

38:34.760 --> 38:37.286
somebody deactivated the alarm
and planted the murder weapon.

38:37.310 --> 38:39.346
A hammer. In the garage.

38:39.370 --> 38:41.436
Trying to seal the case against Quinn.

38:41.460 --> 38:44.456
Wait, you had a murder
weapon and didn't tell me?

38:44.480 --> 38:48.166
Who knew about the alarm
code other than the Taylors?

38:48.190 --> 38:50.530
We have company.

38:53.270 --> 38:54.886
Hi, Harvey.

38:54.910 --> 38:57.160
Hey, what's going on?

38:58.060 --> 39:00.580
Lose a button?

39:01.570 --> 39:04.910
Looks just like the ones on your shirt.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.006
Found it on the couch.

39:08.030 --> 39:09.936
Where you handcuffed Mrs. Taylor.

39:09.960 --> 39:13.926
Other thing you left behind
was a print on the safe.

39:13.950 --> 39:17.336
You didn't know that gloves could
leave prints, did you, Harvey?

39:17.360 --> 39:19.580
Are those yours right there?

39:20.960 --> 39:23.860
Look at that. Frayed seams.

39:27.900 --> 39:31.236
- That's a TASER, Harvey.
- You only have one shot.

39:31.260 --> 39:33.096
Non-fatal.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.550
There's five of us.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.520
Don't move!

39:47.970 --> 39:50.620
- Just breathe through it.
- God!

39:53.110 --> 39:54.826
He confessed?

39:54.850 --> 39:57.086
He knew they kept cash
and jewelry in their safe.

39:57.110 --> 39:59.090
Didn't know that Quinn
was in the garage.

39:59.120 --> 40:02.130
When the wife panicked, She
went into cardiac arrest.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.676
Hmm, the husband freaked, attacked the security
guard with the only weapon he could find.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.846
Quinn's hammer.

40:07.870 --> 40:09.536
The guard overpowered and killed him.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.536
Oh, Abby, ****

40:12.560 --> 40:14.866
Hmm, a cotton-ball bouquet.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.446
See what I got.

40:16.470 --> 40:20.270
- Cufflinks, made out of...
- Spent nine-millimeter slugs.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.290
Friction makes us static.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.356
Would you stop that? I'm
still humming from the TASER.

40:25.380 --> 40:29.966
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight you're all
going to share in a DiNozzo family tradition.

40:29.990 --> 40:32.316
Caramel popcorn, hot mulled cider

40:32.340 --> 40:36.386
and the greatest, greatest
Christmas movie of all time.

40:36.410 --> 40:37.316
It's a Wonderful Life!

40:37.340 --> 40:39.540
- Yay!
- Wonderful.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.606
We can't start until Gibbs gets here.

40:42.630 --> 40:44.316
Oh, he said not to wait for him.

40:44.340 --> 40:46.540
Where is he?

40:52.480 --> 40:54.756
Where are we?

40:54.780 --> 40:56.310
Melissa's house.

40:56.340 --> 40:59.810
No, Gibbs. You don't know me.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.566
I ruin lives; I am poison.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.486
Give yourself some credit.

41:04.510 --> 41:08.116
You're not the same person that dropped out
of her life when she was three years old.

41:08.140 --> 41:10.106
You've changed.

41:10.130 --> 41:11.676
I don't need this. I don't.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.130
She does.

41:18.020 --> 41:21.080
There's too much time that's passed.

41:22.000 --> 41:28.050
If I had one wish for Christmas,
it would be to hug my daughter.

41:32.150 --> 41:36.770
That can never be. You have that chance.

41:57.470 --> 41:59.330
Thank you.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.106
Hello?

42:52.130 --> 42:54.396
Merry Christmas, Dad.

42:54.420 --> 42:56.380
Merry Christmas, Son.
