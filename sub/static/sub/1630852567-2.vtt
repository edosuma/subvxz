21:05.798 --> 21:07.631
By swerving into the path
of the suv.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.167
- Yeah, but grace,
the driver, was sober.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.170
And lily, the passenger,
is also sober.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.571
- Yes.
- And, folks?

21:15.708 --> 21:17.375
Lily has no fatal injuries
on the imaging.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.312
Eli: Well, how 'bout that?

21:21.381 --> 21:24.115
Not a single fatal fracture.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.450
(deep breath) what if the
accident didn't kill her?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.385
- Well, if the accident
didn't kill her,

21:28.454 --> 21:30.154
Then what did?

21:35.762 --> 21:37.894
- How can it be overcooked

21:38.931 --> 21:40.864
And undercooked?!

21:42.001 --> 21:43.934
(scoffs) this makes no sense.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.903
- Wow. That smell.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.672
Oh boy, that's-that takes me
back.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.740
- Yeah, laugh it up.
- No, it's not funny,

21:49.776 --> 21:51.341
I just-I see your father,
david,

21:51.377 --> 21:53.677
He's standing over the stove,
over his rice.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.047
It's like he's performing
a surgery.

21:57.050 --> 22:00.284
- Well, I botched this.
Completely.

22:00.286 --> 22:01.952
- Yeah.
- And I don't know...

22:03.022 --> 22:04.488
I followed everything
to the word.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.290
I-I don't...

22:06.292 --> 22:08.458
- (groans) no, where's the tea?

22:08.494 --> 22:10.494
- Check the, check the labels,
it's in the cupboard somewhere.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.496
- No, no, no, he used to...

22:12.532 --> 22:14.632
He-before he added
the reddish stuff,

22:14.634 --> 22:17.168
The-he would steep it in tea,
you don't remember that?

22:17.303 --> 22:18.902
You must remember that.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.106
- What are you doing?
Do you wanna...

22:22.175 --> 22:23.307
You wanna help me?

22:23.442 --> 22:25.576
- Well, I was reading comics,
but... Okay.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.711
As long as I get to eat it.
- Yeah.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.246
- Okay.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.149
Jenny: Take a look at this.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.654
<i>Alphonse (on p.A.): Dr. Cooper?</i>

22:38.891 --> 22:41.725
<i> Your mom is waiting</i>
<i> to see you upstairs.</i>

22:41.761 --> 22:43.660
(p.A. Chimes)

22:43.696 --> 22:45.929
- (sighs) I know.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.798
There's a form for that.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.739
- Hey, is dad okay?

22:55.742 --> 22:57.241
- Yeah, gordie's fine.

22:57.310 --> 23:00.811
I just thought that this might
brighten up your office.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.914
You know, it's no surprise
that you took up gardening

23:03.983 --> 23:05.949
When you were gone,
and I arrange flowers--

23:06.018 --> 23:07.618
- Sorry, did you pull me out
of an autopsy

23:07.687 --> 23:09.486
To give me a, a plant?!

23:09.555 --> 23:12.823
- Plants are very healing.
They help us to grieve.

23:14.127 --> 23:16.827
I'm here if you want to talk
about liam.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.363
- I'm in the middle
of an autopsy.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.265
- No, I meant later.
- Right.

23:21.334 --> 23:23.233
I'm probably not gonna wanna
talk to you

23:23.269 --> 23:25.636
About liam later, either.
- (sighs)

23:25.705 --> 23:28.038
You'd be surprised
what a good ear I am.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.908
If anybody knows about grief,
it's me.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.844
- Hmm. Peggy, I have a mother
in the next room

23:33.880 --> 23:36.146
Who just lost two children,
and she needs answers.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.648
Answers that I can't give her

23:37.717 --> 23:39.350
When I'm in here talking
with you.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.185
- I'll go.
- Great.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.254
- But I-I really want
to help you through this.

23:43.389 --> 23:44.655
- Any news?

23:44.790 --> 23:48.024
- I-I'm so sorry for the loss
of your children.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.394
- Children? (gasps)
children!

23:50.529 --> 23:52.896
- Peggy, I need you to leave.
Peggy, please.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.866
Ms. Bloom, please come
have a seat.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.071
(sighs heavily)
- you lied to me!

24:01.140 --> 24:02.806
- No, uh...

24:04.877 --> 24:07.077
Lily was alive
when I spoke to her.

24:07.146 --> 24:10.747
But... Unfortunately we found
out that she died

24:12.285 --> 24:13.884
In the ambulance on the way
to the hospital.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.454
- (sighs)

24:19.258 --> 24:21.759
- I'm sorry.
Is there anyone I can call?

24:24.931 --> 24:26.730
Alphonse?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.699
Hey, I need you to make
a few calls for ms. Bloom.

24:29.735 --> 24:32.035
Can you see if there is anybody
that can pick her up,

24:32.071 --> 24:33.871
Stay with her, you know,
any friends or family, just--

24:33.873 --> 24:35.639
- I'm all alone.

24:37.543 --> 24:40.177
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

24:40.312 --> 24:43.781
Those two girls were the only
family I had.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.626
- I am truly sorry
for your loss.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.265
And I'm gonna work as quickly
as possible to get you answers.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.802
Alphonse will get you anything
else you need.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.338
Okay.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.640
- Can he get me back my girls?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.813
- (sighs)

25:17.783 --> 25:19.483
(footsteps recede)

25:22.354 --> 25:23.888
(doors whir open)

25:24.023 --> 25:26.023
- Was there a family emergency?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.557
- No.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.028
- Then probably not the wisest
idea to leave.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.029
Turns out our girl lily

25:33.065 --> 25:35.099
Has petechiae on her trunk

25:35.234 --> 25:36.833
And extremities.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.703
- What are you testing for?

25:39.838 --> 25:41.639
- Neisseria meningitides
bacteria.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.674
- What, you think she has
meningitis?

25:43.809 --> 25:45.576
- Well, it would explain the
rash. And if she did have it,

25:45.711 --> 25:47.844
You may have just given it
to your mom,

25:47.914 --> 25:50.114
And that would be
a family emergency.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.852
- No trace of bacteria.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.855
- Okay.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.523
Okay...

26:02.661 --> 26:04.728
(sighs)

26:04.863 --> 26:06.864
What if it's not a rash?

26:08.267 --> 26:10.133
(footsteps thud)

26:10.169 --> 26:11.936
(door creaks open)

26:12.071 --> 26:14.638
- (sighs) I love it
when she gets that look.

26:17.276 --> 26:18.909
- (sighs)

26:18.978 --> 26:21.378
- (sniffs deeply)
eli: Grace wasn't minty.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.147
- Not mint. Campfire smoke.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.883
- I don't follow.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.851
- Okay, lily smells like mint,

26:27.920 --> 26:29.686
But her hair smells
like campfire smoke.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.555
Grace's does, too.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.558
- I'm thinking the girls
went camping,

26:34.693 --> 26:36.460
And these are black fly bites.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.164
Let's see.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.165
Yeah, her lymph nodes
are swollen.

26:42.234 --> 26:43.901
- And that would be consistent
with a virus.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.903
Mosquitoes, flies, ticks
all carry viruses.

26:48.874 --> 26:51.442
Alphonse, can you speak
with ms. Bloom and find out

26:51.444 --> 26:54.445
If her daughters were camping,
and where?

26:54.447 --> 26:55.779
(cell phone rings)

26:55.914 --> 26:59.049
Perhaps lily caught some kind
of environmental contagion.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.784
I love a good mystery,
don't you?

27:00.820 --> 27:02.519
- Dr. Cooper.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.555
Malik: Hey, those tox results
back yet?

27:04.690 --> 27:06.623
I really, really need
those tox results.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.558
- Yeah, they came back
negative.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.494
- Okay.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.264
Okay, this is gonna sound weird,

27:14.333 --> 27:17.267
But did either occupant
of the car have any signs

27:17.269 --> 27:21.204
Of an allergic reaction,
like, to an insect sting?

27:21.273 --> 27:23.207
Eli: There was no evidence
of a bee sting

27:23.342 --> 27:25.275
Or any kind of anaphylactic
shock.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.744
If we need something more
from you, detective,

27:26.879 --> 27:28.312
We'll call you.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.879
- I'll let you know if we find
anything else.

27:29.915 --> 27:31.548
- Thank you, jenny.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.952

27:36.022 --> 27:38.422
<i>Alphonse (on p.A): So the girls</i>
<i> were camping.</i>

27:38.557 --> 27:40.323
<i> They rented a cabin</i>
<i> in algonquin park.</i>

27:41.394 --> 27:43.359
- What about hantavirus?

27:43.396 --> 27:46.530
- Well, humans can contract it
from deer mice feces.

27:48.033 --> 27:50.434
Maybe the girls were exposed to
it when they were in the cabin.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.969
- If hantavirus is spreading
in a provincial park,

27:53.005 --> 27:54.505
More people could die.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.973
We'll have to notify
the authorities.

27:57.309 --> 28:00.377
- Okay, we are looking
for microscopic lesions

28:00.379 --> 28:01.978
In the lungs,
they will be heavy.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.848
Then there will be fluid
in the pleural cavity.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.118
- Let's open her up.

28:08.253 --> 28:09.720
- Yeah.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.545

Because I just-I haven't made

28:39.785 --> 28:41.985

28:59.838 --> 29:02.005
- Wait a second,
why aren't you at work?

29:03.342 --> 29:06.443

You know, I may have coloured
outside the lines a little.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.586
- What does that mean,
"coloured outside the lines?"

29:15.588 --> 29:16.987
- Why are you giving me
the third degree?

29:17.056 --> 29:19.323
- Third degree? I--you haven't
been at work for four months.

Of everyone being so concerned
about me.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.600
I'm not an invalid!
- I didn't say that.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.000

29:31.036 --> 29:32.836

29:32.838 --> 29:35.338

30:59.725 --> 31:01.291
What is it?

31:01.426 --> 31:04.127
- River, you must have made
a mistake with the tox screen.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.162
- River doesn't make mistakes.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.900
- Run the tox screen again.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.845
<i> Malik: Yeah, it does.</i>

31:21.847 --> 31:23.246
- Okay, the girls were coming
from algonquin park.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.982
Can you tell me where
they were going?

31:24.984 --> 31:26.917
- Yeah, sunnydell hospital.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.919
Eli: Cooper, what are you doing?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.720
- Collaborating with the police,

31:30.756 --> 31:33.323
You should try it some time,
maybe you'll find it helps.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.525
- Okay, so if the girls were
on their way to the hospital,

31:35.594 --> 31:37.127
That means one of them
was sick, right?

31:37.129 --> 31:39.730
- Yeah, it's most likely lily,
her cod is still a mystery.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.665
- Well, I have a witness
who insists that she saw

31:41.667 --> 31:43.266
The passenger of the car
waving their arms around

31:43.269 --> 31:44.801
To shoo away a bee.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.269
- What if it was a seizure?
Thanks.

31:47.606 --> 31:48.972
(phone thuds)

31:52.611 --> 31:56.680
Mint. The menthol in peppermint
can have adverse side effects

31:56.749 --> 31:58.215
If taken in large quantities,
right?

31:58.350 --> 32:00.283
- Yes, but it's generally
not lethal.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.519
Unless she had an underlying
condition.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.755
- Yeah, we need to talk
to the mom.

32:05.791 --> 32:08.692
- By all means, do it your way,
doctor cooper.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.697
- Just take one breath,
that's it.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.299
And the next.
- (inhales and exhales)

32:16.368 --> 32:19.569
And the next.
- (inhales and exhales)

32:19.571 --> 32:21.238

sweetie,

32:21.240 --> 32:23.507
I know it feels that way.
But you're not.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.244
- Peggy! What are you doing?

32:27.379 --> 32:29.012
- Helping a friend.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.681
- Okay, um, can I talk to you
outside for a second, please?

32:34.319 --> 32:35.918
- (reluctant exhale)

32:35.955 --> 32:37.287
I'm sorry.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.525
- I'll be right back.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.063
What are you still doing here?

32:46.065 --> 32:48.732
- I was on my way out,
but renata was so upset,

32:48.867 --> 32:51.068
Jenny, I could practically hear
her sobs from the parking lot--

32:51.203 --> 32:54.271
- Do you-do you have any idea
how inappropriate this is?

32:54.273 --> 32:56.206
Okay, you are not her friend.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.441
You are not a grief counsellor.
You are my mother!

32:59.478 --> 33:01.411
- It's nice to hear you
say that.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.149
- I will see you at home.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.021
(footsteps recede)

33:13.726 --> 33:15.225
- (readying exhale)

33:15.360 --> 33:17.293
- Thank you for lending me
your mother.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.762
- Mm-hmm.

33:18.897 --> 33:21.431
Uh... Can I ask you a few
questions about lily?

33:23.335 --> 33:25.268
Do you know if she had any
underlying health conditions?

33:25.337 --> 33:28.105
- No, nothing.
Apart from the flu.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.839
- She had the flu?

33:29.875 --> 33:32.242
- No, she had a headache,
nausea.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.311
Lily wasn't as open with me.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.945
- Was she acting unusual
at all?

33:36.015 --> 33:38.915
- She'd had a fight with her
boyfriend and he broke it off.

33:38.917 --> 33:41.217
I had to learn about it
from grace.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.653
It's why they went
to the cabin.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.388
- Okay. Um...

33:47.459 --> 33:49.126
Do you know if lily
was sexually active

33:49.128 --> 33:51.661
With her boyfriend?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.232
Okay. Thank you.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.869
(computer keys clack,

33:59.905 --> 34:02.405

34:02.408 --> 34:04.874
You here to follow up
on mac's debrief?

34:04.910 --> 34:06.676
- He hasn't done it yet.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.611
He took a personal day instead.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.448

34:15.754 --> 34:17.487

34:19.024 --> 34:21.658
Ohh!

34:21.793 --> 34:23.593
All right.
- All right.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.729
I feel good about this.
I feel very good.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.365

34:28.367 --> 34:30.100

34:31.737 --> 34:33.203

- Oh!

34:33.338 --> 34:35.271

- (laughs)

34:36.375 --> 34:38.108
- Well, six out of ten.
- Six out of--okay.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.343
We'll say six.
- There's a little dip there.

34:40.345 --> 34:42.112
- Ohh!
- Very good. Very good.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.980
- We'll should...
Give 'er a go?

34:44.049 --> 34:45.515
- Yes.
- It's gonna be hot.

34:45.584 --> 34:46.983
Be careful.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.286
(forks clink)
oh, it's nice underneath.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.189
- It's fine.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.124
(light blowing)

34:55.827 --> 34:57.127
- Ow! A little hot.
Yeah, that's good.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.794
- Mmm!

34:58.831 --> 35:00.730
- This is like,
as good as your dad's.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.999
- That's not half bad. Mmm!

35:03.001 --> 35:04.734
- Mmm, and so fragrant.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.870
- (sniffs) yeah,

35:07.005 --> 35:08.605
It's spearmint, not mint.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.207
I knew I had smelled that
before.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.875
It's pennyroyal.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.076
And an overdose of pennyroyal
can cause seizures,

35:14.113 --> 35:15.679
Multiple organ failure.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.747
- Isn't pennyroyal generally
used as a topical

35:17.816 --> 35:19.215
Bug repellant?
- Yeah,

35:19.284 --> 35:21.685
But if you take enough of it,
it can induce abortion.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.887
- There was no evidence
of a fetus.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.589
- Well, maybe that's because
she aborted it, right?

35:25.724 --> 35:27.023
If you think about it,

35:27.158 --> 35:29.058
Lily and her boyfriend
got in a fight,

35:29.094 --> 35:30.893
Her and her sister went away
for the weekend,

35:30.895 --> 35:32.762
And they were on their way
to the hospital

35:32.764 --> 35:34.931
When they got in the accident.
- So lily had a seizure,

35:35.066 --> 35:37.667
Which caused grace to lose
control of the car.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.171
- But why would she try
to induce an abortion herself

35:41.306 --> 35:43.140
When she could've gone
to her doctor?

35:43.275 --> 35:45.841
Or an abortion clinic?
- Okay, she was also 15, right?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.412
So she would've needed
her mother's approval.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.781

You blew off your debrief?
- What are you doing here?

36:03.996 --> 36:05.862

answers, because you're not

36:05.997 --> 36:07.330
Willing to talk to anybody else
about what happened.

36:07.465 --> 36:09.132

When are you gonna get that

36:09.267 --> 36:10.433
Through your skull?!

36:10.469 --> 36:12.335
- Mac! You held a man's gun
to your head,

36:12.337 --> 36:15.071
And you told him to shoot you!
What you did was insane, man!

36:15.140 --> 36:17.340
I don't wanna die, and I don't
wanna watch you get killed,

36:17.342 --> 36:19.308
Because you need to prove
you're not weak.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.013
- What's he talking about?

36:23.148 --> 36:24.381
- Malik was just leaving.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.717
- Is that really what happened?
- Malik, you need to go.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.553
- And you need to do
your debrief.

36:40.632 --> 36:43.033
Were you not thinking about us?
Or me?

36:43.168 --> 36:45.235
- Honestly, no. And it's not
because I don't care,

36:45.237 --> 36:46.903
It's just that's how
I have to do the job.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.172
- Your job is more important
than your life?

36:49.307 --> 36:50.906
- It's the one constant
in my life.

36:50.943 --> 36:52.408
The thing I've always
been good at.

36:52.477 --> 36:54.044

partner, maybe you want a cat.

37:13.298 --> 37:14.597
