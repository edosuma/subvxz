<i>If the matter is supplied</i>

Hey, sleepyhead.
We're running a bit late today.

05:13.297 --> 05:15.755
Come on, everything will be fine.

05:16.297 --> 05:19.588
Just one more week
and it's summer vacation.

05:21.672 --> 05:23.838
It's my mother's birthday today.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.588
You know what we said about that.

05:43.672 --> 05:45.880

Shall we?

05:58.422 --> 05:59.630
Come on.

06:06.505 --> 06:08.880
<i>Regina, you'll be late!</i>

06:08.963 --> 06:12.880
The French delegation
is visiting the plant. I just can't do it.

06:12.963 --> 06:16.422
No problem.
I don't have anything else to do.

06:16.505 --> 06:19.630
-Regina!
-I really can do this more often.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.922
Regina!

06:27.130 --> 06:29.047
Where did you find this little one?

06:32.297 --> 06:34.880
-Looks like Gretchen.
-Nonsense.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.630
Regina, where are you?

06:40.797 --> 06:42.255
Listen.

06:42.963 --> 06:45.130
I actually wanted to talk to you.

06:46.172 --> 06:49.297
There's something I have to tell you.

06:51.297 --> 06:53.047
Hi, Grandpa. Can we go?

06:55.713 --> 06:57.922
No need to say bye. No problem!

06:58.797 --> 07:00.297
You wanted to tell me something?

07:04.338 --> 07:05.755
Never mind.

07:06.797 --> 07:08.088

The interview with Mrs. Tiedemann.

07:56.505 --> 07:58.505
-Already forgotten?
-No.

07:59.505 --> 08:01.547
I thought you might do it alone after all.

08:02.755 --> 08:04.963
Why? Do you have something better to do?

08:05.047 --> 08:08.797
No. I just wonder
why we're starting with Mrs. Tiedemann.

08:10.255 --> 08:12.588
She has no link
to any of the missing people.

08:14.130 --> 08:18.338
Everyone disappeared near the caves
and the nuclear power plant grounds.

08:18.922 --> 08:24.755
Your colleague Ulrich Nielsen's brother
disappeared in that area in 1986 as well.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.338
And then...

08:27.047 --> 08:31.172
there's also the door in the caves
leading right to the nuclear power plant.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.047
How long have Aleksander Tiedemann
and his wife been married?

08:37.463 --> 08:39.088
I don't exactly know.

08:40.922 --> 08:43.880
Regina was... in her mid-twenties.

08:44.463 --> 08:45.463
Why?

08:46.297 --> 08:48.297
Don't you find it unusual?

08:49.422 --> 08:50.755
What?

08:50.838 --> 08:53.630
That Aleksander Tiedemann
took his wife's name?

08:54.630 --> 08:55.797
No.

08:58.463 --> 09:00.047
Shall we go?

09:13.463 --> 09:15.463
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

09:38.172 --> 09:39.588
Hey, where have you been?

09:41.130 --> 09:44.963
Why didn't you call me back?
I was trying to reach you the whole time.

09:46.755 --> 09:49.755
Last year,
I know where you got the money.

09:50.672 --> 09:54.047
Blow job 40 euros, anal 85.
Kinky stuff costs extra?

09:54.630 --> 09:58.838
Who did you do it with, huh?
Who did you blow in this damn shithole?

09:59.630 --> 10:02.963
Nothing has changed.
Everyone lies. Everyone cheats.

10:04.213 --> 10:07.338
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-I followed you.

10:07.422 --> 10:09.297
I know who you get your money from.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.505
Your first thought
is that I prostitute myself?

10:14.088 --> 10:15.130
What else?

10:16.255 --> 10:18.547
I don't sell my tits or my ass!

10:18.630 --> 10:21.880
I sell hormone therapy prescriptions,
you idiot!

10:21.963 --> 10:24.297
My father used to use them
to pay for his visits.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.130
He stopped going,
and now I'm the new supplier.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.713
Why do you do it?

10:31.797 --> 10:34.505
I help her, she helps me.
It's that simple.

10:36.838 --> 10:41.380
The secrets aren't the problem,
it's the shit we all project onto others.

10:42.463 --> 10:45.380
I said it's none of your fucking business,
and it isn't!

10:45.463 --> 10:49.130
I can't believe you spied on me.
How messed up are you?

11:36.213 --> 11:37.338
What's that?

11:38.213 --> 11:39.047
A time machine.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.380
This machine takes you 33 years
into the past

11:47.463 --> 11:49.297
and 33 years into the future.

12:00.213 --> 12:01.297
You're serious?

12:06.505 --> 12:08.088
I did it all wrong.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.422
I tried to keep a secret.

12:14.088 --> 12:16.630
The truth is,
that is exactly what's destroying us.

12:18.422 --> 12:19.713
The secrets.

12:20.963 --> 12:22.713
Mom, I know that sounds insane.

12:24.172 --> 12:26.505
That's why I want you to see for yourself.

12:26.588 --> 12:28.047
With your own eyes.

12:30.422 --> 12:31.797
What do you mean?

12:33.880 --> 12:35.463

13:00.005 --> 13:01.255
Out of the way, dork!

13:12.630 --> 13:14.463

13:29.297 --> 13:32.922
Thank God you're here.
Someone's waiting for you in your office.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.255
I didn't know.

13:37.213 --> 13:38.713
About the dog.

13:40.338 --> 13:42.130
She says it's hers.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.422
Is that your dog?

14:02.380 --> 14:03.422
I'm so sorry.

14:05.255 --> 14:06.880
She ran up to me.

14:11.838 --> 14:14.880
We called the shelter,
but no one had reported her missing.

14:17.630 --> 14:21.380
-And she resembles the dog I had as a kid.
-Gretchen.

14:29.588 --> 14:31.005
How do you know that?

14:34.672 --> 14:36.380
Because it's my dog.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.172
Just like it's yours.

14:46.922 --> 14:48.338
Excuse me?

14:50.630 --> 14:52.380
<i>And the blood test results?</i>

14:53.963 --> 14:56.172
So it has already spread.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.130

15:00.005 --> 15:01.588
This Friday?

15:02.297 --> 15:03.463
No.

15:07.922 --> 15:09.838
Yes, that should work.

15:13.547 --> 15:16.338
Don't worry. I have someone.

This precise moment.

16:24.088 --> 16:25.380
Go to the blinds.

16:27.838 --> 16:29.130
Trust me.

16:34.755 --> 16:38.005
Two people are sitting at their desks,
Hermann and Kowaltschik.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.922
Our secretary will approach
the desk on the right in a moment.

16:42.005 --> 16:44.088
She'll fan her face on the way.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.547
Watch Kowaltschik.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.713
He's about to drop his pen.

16:57.547 --> 16:58.922
How did you do that?

16:59.922 --> 17:01.588
I experienced it all.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.630
Everything you've ever experienced
and everything you ever will.

17:06.588 --> 17:07.755
I am you.

17:07.838 --> 17:11.422
And I was told by me
that you and I are the same person.

17:14.213 --> 17:15.338
That's impossible.

17:23.713 --> 17:24.880
This is Gretchen.

17:26.505 --> 17:30.755
The day she ran into the cave
I was there waiting for her.

17:30.838 --> 17:34.130
She recognized me at once,
as if I hadn't aged a second.

17:37.547 --> 17:40.755
I brought her to the other side
so you would find her.

17:43.838 --> 17:47.713
Some things have to happen
as they always have.

17:49.047 --> 17:50.380
The cave.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.338
The incident last summer.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.172
Something else happened afterall!

21:17.380 --> 21:19.088
Do you believe in ghosts?

21:20.005 --> 21:21.672
What do you mean?

21:21.755 --> 21:24.422
The book we're reading at school.

21:25.130 --> 21:28.047
It's about the ghosts and demons

21:28.130 --> 21:30.672
that we inherit from our parents.

21:30.755 --> 21:32.005
And...

21:32.088 --> 21:33.880
that you pass them on.

21:35.672 --> 21:36.963
Dark stuff.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.255
From generation to generation.

21:44.630 --> 21:45.630
Maybe.

21:48.297 --> 21:51.463
But you sure inherited
your mother's best features.

21:52.755 --> 21:54.755
I didn't even know she had any.

21:54.838 --> 21:55.838
No?

21:57.505 --> 21:59.672
You have no idea.

22:00.838 --> 22:02.630
She... She's never around.

22:03.213 --> 22:06.630
And when she is,
all she does is gripe about me.

22:09.838 --> 22:12.672
She has never once said
"I love you" to me.

22:16.755 --> 22:18.005
I love you.

22:30.172 --> 22:33.005
How would you describe
your relationship with Ulrich Nielsen?

22:33.755 --> 22:37.297
I think it's known that we have
no relationship with the Nielsens.

22:40.672 --> 22:43.755
Yet he showed up at your hotel
the day before he disappeared.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.380
What did he want?

22:48.838 --> 22:51.713
He wanted to know
what really happened in 1986.

22:51.797 --> 22:53.672
Because I was the last one...

22:54.130 --> 22:55.922
to see his brother alive.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.630
Your husband.

23:05.088 --> 23:06.547
How long has he lived in Winden?

23:08.838 --> 23:12.255
Since 1986. Why do you ask?

23:12.338 --> 23:14.588
Why did he take your last name?

23:16.588 --> 23:19.047
What does one have to do with the other?

23:19.463 --> 23:20.297
If we're done--

23:24.713 --> 23:26.630
There's still something.

23:29.172 --> 23:30.005
Isn't there?

23:36.255 --> 23:38.547
Last year, a stranger came to the hotel.

23:39.755 --> 23:41.297
Those are his things.

23:49.338 --> 23:50.838
He wanted a room.

23:52.755 --> 23:54.797
He looked like a homeless person.

23:56.047 --> 23:57.505
He paid cash.

23:58.172 --> 23:59.255
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

23:59.338 --> 24:02.130
He left after a few days,
but he wanted to keep the room.

24:04.755 --> 24:05.755
He never came back.

24:07.380 --> 24:10.047
These were all over his walls.

24:13.713 --> 24:17.297
As he was leaving, he asked me
to mail a package for him.

24:18.213 --> 24:19.088
To whom?

24:20.797 --> 24:22.213
Jonas Kahnwald.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.797
Why did you not report this?

24:38.213 --> 24:41.713
I have to go. Elisabeth has a swim class.
I totally forgot.

24:43.213 --> 24:46.422
Sorry. You can take a taxi.

24:57.463 --> 24:58.297
Well...

25:17.088 --> 25:18.380
This stranger,

25:20.963 --> 25:23.005
what did he look like?

25:50.088 --> 25:51.463
What is this?

25:56.547 --> 25:58.130
What are we doing here?

25:59.463 --> 26:01.547
It's safer to travel from here.

26:17.088 --> 26:20.380
I told you it would be easier
to understand once you've seen it.

26:47.963 --> 26:49.213
Don't be scared.

27:40.713 --> 27:42.755
Shouldn't you be at school?

27:52.588 --> 27:54.213
I know you.

27:55.380 --> 27:56.963
You were in the hospital.

28:01.338 --> 28:02.838
I like coming here.

28:03.922 --> 28:05.380
Special place.

28:08.380 --> 28:09.380
So...

28:11.880 --> 28:13.588
Why aren't you at school?

28:19.672 --> 28:20.713
I see.

28:21.172 --> 28:24.005
Sometimes we don't really know
where we're supposed to be<i>.</i>

28:28.422 --> 28:30.130
But I wouldn't go in there.

28:30.713 --> 28:32.838
It's like a maze in there.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.713
Some have never returned.

28:42.672 --> 28:43.963
In the hospital<i>,</i>

28:44.422 --> 28:45.922
you said something.

28:47.088 --> 28:52.005
The thing about God,
and that he has a plan for everyone.

28:53.130 --> 28:55.713
But what if God
has no idea what he's doing?

28:56.422 --> 28:59.338
If the plan is wrong? If God is mistaken?

29:01.213 --> 29:02.797
God doesn't make mistakes.

29:06.880 --> 29:10.588
Sometimes we have to have more faith
that everything will be okay again.

29:33.422 --> 29:35.880
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

29:36.588 --> 29:38.130
To come by.

29:39.630 --> 29:42.880
Now that I'm retired, I have time.

29:51.630 --> 29:52.755
I...

29:58.422 --> 30:00.297
Mads' disappearance.

30:01.588 --> 30:03.380
I can't stop thinking about it.

30:04.380 --> 30:06.213
On that day...

30:07.463 --> 30:10.213
you had a shift
at the nuclear power plant.

30:11.255 --> 30:16.630
You said you took the country road home,
but that's a detour.

30:18.672 --> 30:21.297
Why didn't you take the forest road?

30:24.172 --> 30:27.005
He... He said...

30:28.130 --> 30:30.338
he can change everything.

30:30.422 --> 30:33.422
He can change the past, and the future.

30:34.005 --> 30:35.588
Who said that?

30:36.338 --> 30:38.172
The man with the stone.

30:38.838 --> 30:43.172
But that was 30 years ago.
What does that have to do with Mads?

30:43.838 --> 30:46.338
But no one can change it. No one.

30:47.297 --> 30:49.047
Not even the White Devil.

30:50.338 --> 30:51.838
The White Devil?

30:52.797 --> 30:56.380
You've said that before.
Back then, as a child.

31:04.172 --> 31:05.880
Tick, tock.

31:06.463 --> 31:07.797
Tick, tock.

31:09.672 --> 31:11.088
Tick, tock...

31:11.172 --> 31:15.047
<i>I'd like you to trust in an idea</i>
<i>that's bigger than you.</i>

31:15.130 --> 31:17.172
Bigger than any of us.

31:21.505 --> 31:22.713
What's that?

31:24.047 --> 31:26.380
This is humankind's greatest discovery.

31:27.088 --> 31:29.213
And also its doom.

31:30.130 --> 31:32.338
It allows you to travel through time.

31:33.797 --> 31:35.838
Thirty three years back.

31:37.338 --> 31:39.213
Thirty three years forward.

31:40.463 --> 31:44.922
And it will take exactly 33 years
for the cycle to be completed again.

31:45.005 --> 31:48.130
Until you are standing
where I am standing now

31:48.213 --> 31:51.088
and accept your role
in this never-ending dance,

31:52.088 --> 31:53.880
and every sacrifice it requires.

31:55.338 --> 31:57.255
In five days, everything will start over.

31:58.713 --> 32:00.172
You must stop Adam.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.297
Who is Adam?

32:05.963 --> 32:07.922
You don't understand it yet.

32:11.255 --> 32:12.755
But you soon will.

32:18.338 --> 32:21.880
Until then, everything will happen
as it always has.

32:23.963 --> 32:25.630
As it must.

32:30.963 --> 32:34.838
In the end, life is just a collection
of missed opportunities.

32:36.672 --> 32:39.255
You don't have much more time with Regina.

32:41.422 --> 32:43.213
But if everything works out...

32:46.755 --> 32:48.172
she will live.

34:00.547 --> 34:03.630
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME
H.G. TANNHAUS

34:10.088 --> 34:11.297
<i>Charlotte?</i>

34:13.547 --> 34:14.755
Charlotte?

34:16.422 --> 34:20.255
-Is everything okay?
-Last year when the children disappeared,

34:21.505 --> 34:23.672
a man was in Regina's hotel.

34:23.755 --> 34:25.963
<i>He had drawings with him.</i>

34:26.047 --> 34:27.338
<i>Copies.</i>

34:27.963 --> 34:29.713
What kind of drawings?

34:29.797 --> 34:31.922
They're from the book!

34:32.005 --> 34:35.255
The book my grandfather wrote.
<i>A Journey Through Time.</i>

34:36.422 --> 34:39.588
-<i>Everyone always said he was nuts.</i>
-Where are you?

34:39.672 --> 34:42.172
<i>But he knew that it was all true!</i>

34:43.380 --> 34:45.297
Why did he have that photo?

34:50.463 --> 34:54.338
Why did he never tell me
who my parents really were?

35:20.463 --> 35:21.797
You know the rules.

35:29.005 --> 35:30.922
Do you think they don't apply to you?

35:34.880 --> 35:36.213
Why are you lying to them?

35:36.880 --> 35:39.255
Why don't you tell them
what's really in the dead zone?

35:47.380 --> 35:50.797
In five days, in my time,
everybody is going to die.

35:51.338 --> 35:52.963
I have to stop that.

35:55.005 --> 35:56.630
There is no prophecy!

35:57.505 --> 35:59.630
The passage will never open.

36:00.213 --> 36:03.005
Your paradise does not exist!

36:03.880 --> 36:04.880
But behind that wall--

36:41.130 --> 36:42.422
WINDEN BOY MISSING

36:42.505 --> 36:45.130
Hello? Egon here.

36:45.713 --> 36:46.588
Yes.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.422
MISSING PERSON REPORT:
MADS NIELSEN

36:48.505 --> 36:50.338
Listen, in 1953 we arrested a man.

36:50.422 --> 36:52.005
MADS NIELSEN CASE:
POLICE IN DARK

36:52.088 --> 36:53.463
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
AFTER 1953?

36:53.547 --> 36:56.463
He killed two kids back then.
Then he abducted Helge Doppler.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.005
NO RESULT

36:59.172 --> 37:02.297
I wanted to know what became of him.

37:04.130 --> 37:05.713
Yes, I'll hold.

37:07.463 --> 37:11.880
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

37:11.963 --> 37:13.380
Yes.

37:14.755 --> 37:16.422
Okay, that's the case.

37:19.005 --> 37:20.838
What? He's still here?

37:22.547 --> 37:23.672
Where?

37:48.630 --> 37:51.588
-Yes?
-Chief Inspector Tiedemann.

37:52.505 --> 37:54.547
I'd like to speak to a patient.

37:58.463 --> 38:00.588
Weren't you notified I was coming?

38:01.588 --> 38:03.130
Not that I know of.

38:04.588 --> 38:05.755
Well...

38:07.255 --> 38:08.838
File number...

38:09.630 --> 38:11.213
K53.

38:13.588 --> 38:16.297
He must have been here for 34 years now.

38:18.547 --> 38:19.672
The Inspector?

38:22.172 --> 38:23.713
We call him that here.

38:23.797 --> 38:26.755
Nice guy. He's been here longer
than most of the staff.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.880
Practically part of the furniture.

38:29.963 --> 38:33.255
-He'll be glad to have a visitor.
-Does he...

38:34.380 --> 38:35.922
Does he get day-release?

38:36.630 --> 38:38.380
No, he's in the closed ward.

38:52.755 --> 38:55.588
The guy over there,
with the long gray hair.

38:56.588 --> 38:57.672
Thanks.

39:17.463 --> 39:19.338
Excuse me, please.

39:21.463 --> 39:24.380
You may not remember me anymore.

39:26.422 --> 39:28.588
My name is Egon Tiedemann.

39:29.297 --> 39:32.172
I arrested you 34 years ago.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.713
Egon Tiedemann.

39:47.047 --> 39:49.338
How could I ever forget you?

39:53.213 --> 39:54.297
I...

39:55.630 --> 39:56.880
I wanted...

39:58.797 --> 40:00.463
I have a few questions.

40:09.630 --> 40:15.005
My only aim is to take many lives.
The more the better I feel.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.047
I know that.

40:19.088 --> 40:21.130
You've said that before.

40:22.380 --> 40:24.130
What does it mean?

40:25.463 --> 40:29.047
It means that you, you moron,
still haven't understood a thing.

40:31.297 --> 40:35.172
But now you have to hurry.
You don't have much time left.

40:36.088 --> 40:37.838
I know when you die.

40:38.797 --> 40:40.380
It was in the paper.

40:43.922 --> 40:45.213
I don't understand.

40:45.797 --> 40:47.755
No, of course you don't.

40:48.797 --> 40:51.422
But maybe that is also your fate.

40:51.505 --> 40:54.838
To die as clueless as you were
when you were born.

40:59.422 --> 41:01.505
Everyone gets what they deserve.

41:20.963 --> 41:22.672
Where have you been?

41:25.963 --> 41:27.922
I was so worried.

41:32.338 --> 41:35.172
I called the school.
They said you never showed up there.

41:38.213 --> 41:39.797
Did something happen?

41:47.797 --> 41:49.213
You know what?

41:51.505 --> 41:54.922
There are days it's best to just forget.

41:57.380 --> 41:58.547
But...

42:01.797 --> 42:05.005
there's no better comfort food
than "Toast Hawaii."

42:06.463 --> 42:08.838
We always had it at home
when I was little,

42:08.922 --> 42:10.755
with two maraschino cherries.

42:10.838 --> 42:12.422
And my dad used to dance,

42:12.505 --> 42:13.838
like Elvis.

42:14.630 --> 42:15.838
PINEAPPLES

42:15.922 --> 42:17.713
Do you believe in God?

42:25.213 --> 42:27.547
Do you believe he has a plan for us?

42:34.047 --> 42:36.713
I believe... he does.

42:39.213 --> 42:42.255
I believe, for example, that God saw to it

42:42.338 --> 42:44.130
that you came to me.

42:45.755 --> 42:48.380
And that his plan for me is

42:48.463 --> 42:50.213
to be there for you.

42:55.422 --> 42:57.755
Right, let's make "Toast Hawaii," okay?

42:58.713 --> 43:00.088
Will you help me?

44:18.088 --> 44:20.005
Why didn't she kill you?

44:23.713 --> 44:25.130
Who are you really?

44:27.838 --> 44:29.297
Who are you?

44:53.922 --> 44:55.630
I want you to show me.

44:59.463 --> 45:01.463
What's really in the dead zone.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.338
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

48:58.297 --> 49:01.963
BUILDING YOUR FAMILY'S HAPPINESS

49:36.630 --> 49:38.255
What is that?

49:39.088 --> 49:40.797
She said it's a portal.

49:41.588 --> 49:42.588
Who?

49:43.505 --> 49:45.630
I have tapes
with a woman speaking on them.

49:46.297 --> 49:48.047
Her name is Claudia Tiedemann.

49:48.130 --> 49:51.880
I know none of this makes sense,
but that may be the only way back home.

49:54.213 --> 49:55.838
No clue if it works.

50:20.505 --> 50:22.172
You want to go in?

50:25.963 --> 50:28.255
It doesn't matter
if I die inside it or out here.

50:56.755 --> 50:58.047
Jonas!

54:23.755 --> 54:25.755
