Media doesn't know this yet,

10:35.519 --> 10:37.835
but the only thing they hit
was a safe-deposit box

10:37.938 --> 10:39.020
opened under
a stolen identity,

10:39.139 --> 10:41.139
so we can't even identify
the owner.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.508
And the one
I managed to take down,

10:43.610 --> 10:45.060
he doesn't seem to exist.

10:46.313 --> 10:50.065
I figured since
you don't seem to exist...

10:50.150 --> 10:51.816
Maybe you could shed some light.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.820
(gunfire)

10:55.906 --> 10:57.155
barbarians.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.690
They'll just shoot at anything.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.874
Officer down, officer down!

10:59.993 --> 11:02.360
Damn, look at him
racing out there like that.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.411
No wonder
they have a thing.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.879
I wouldn't call it "a thing."

11:04.998 --> 11:06.414
yeah?
What would you call it, then?

11:06.500 --> 11:09.217
It's called mutual respect,
harry.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.369
Oh, yeah, no, of course,
but, uh,

11:11.471 --> 11:12.721
are you sure
you're cool with this?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.756
I mean, talk
about exposure.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.508
He came to me this time.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.676
I couldn't say no.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.261
The way these guys work
their gear,

11:20.347 --> 11:22.013
I'm willing to bet they
have special forces training.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.314
Well, if that's true,
then our dead guy should

11:23.400 --> 11:24.599
be in one of the databases.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.552
Only he's not. We ran
him through military,

11:27.654 --> 11:29.187
fbi, interpol and

11:29.272 --> 11:30.772
he's not in the system,
which he would be

11:30.857 --> 11:33.057
unless he's in a classified
closed system database

11:33.160 --> 11:34.225
I can't access, in which case--

11:34.327 --> 11:35.744
and I don't admit this lightly--

11:35.862 --> 11:36.861
I can't help.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.363
But you know who could?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.918
Look, yes, bishop absolutely
should have told you

11:44.037 --> 11:45.837
the cia traded
away mason quinn,

11:45.939 --> 11:47.872
but, I don't know,
he was trying to protect you.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.073
He lied to me.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.458
I know.
About a terrorist

11:50.544 --> 11:51.459
who tried to kill me.
I know.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.761
How can I ever trust him again?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.262
(scoffs) you don't have
to trust him.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.214
Look, bishop probably
hates that

11:56.299 --> 11:58.850
you're mad at him.
Use that to leverage him.

12:01.104 --> 12:02.137
You know why
I love you, right?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.888
Yeah, 'cause I'm smart, loyal

12:03.974 --> 12:05.390
and I'm fun to be around.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.474
You know why I love you?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.293
The thing I do
with the bandanas?

12:08.395 --> 12:09.861
Pretty much.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.398
He says he'll meet.
Great.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.482
Picture him with angel wings.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.734
That always works for me.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.403
And I'll look into
the safe-deposit box.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.537
If they opened it
using a fake id,

12:19.623 --> 12:20.905
whoever stole the id
probably left

12:20.991 --> 12:22.407
a digital fingerprint.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.495
Bishop:
Well.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.048
This is a nice, deserted spot.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.285
You're not planning
on shooting me, are you?

12:34.387 --> 12:36.087
Depends on
how this meeting goes.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.841
I heard about delilah.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.459
What happened
to her friend,

12:41.561 --> 12:42.794
that's a terrible thing.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.313
I also heard that
she's been staying at her dad's

12:45.432 --> 12:46.481
for the last
couple of weeks.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.932
What, are you keeping tabs
on me?

12:48.018 --> 12:49.601
Well, just 'cause you're pissed

12:49.686 --> 12:50.968
doesn't mean
I stopped caring. Okay?

12:51.071 --> 12:51.986
What happened?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.105
She found out.
How much?

12:54.191 --> 12:56.641
Everything.
About the cia,

12:56.743 --> 12:57.859
what I do now.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.577
That I've been lying to her
her entire life.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.978
You know, like that.
Oy.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.615
Nothing like counting on
a hormonal 15-year-old

13:03.700 --> 13:05.366
to keep your
life and death secrets, right?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.951
(sighs)

13:07.037 --> 13:09.370
but that's not why you're here.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.591
I need a name.

13:13.677 --> 13:14.826
He and his pals shot up

13:14.928 --> 13:16.994
the first world bank
this morning.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.880
Police can't identify him;
neither can I.

13:21.601 --> 13:22.717
Hey, you owe me.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.002
(scoffs) okay.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.505
I'll see what I can do.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.107
I have something for you.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.560
Everything I could dig up
on mason quinn

13:32.646 --> 13:34.946
since the cia let him go.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.898
I figure
I owe you that, too.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.182
But a word of advice.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.400
Don't open it.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.185
He's not
your problem anymore.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.122
Don't let yourself get dragged
back into the past.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.329
(phone ringing)

13:52.465 --> 13:53.548
harry, what you got?

13:53.667 --> 13:55.133
All right,
so you know that stolen identity

13:55.218 --> 13:56.801
that was used to rent the box?

13:56.887 --> 13:59.337
Well, looks like it was, uh,
sold on the dark web

13:59.422 --> 14:00.505
after a data breach.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.341
So I cross-referenced
its uses with

14:03.426 --> 14:06.010
source isps,
fraudulent purchases,

14:06.096 --> 14:07.729
credit card company
investigations...

14:07.848 --> 14:09.013
Harry, remember
that conversation

14:09.099 --> 14:10.882
about you giving me
too much detail?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.217
But it's the details that
make it sound impressive, man.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.652
I mean, what, would you
prefer it if I was just like,

14:14.738 --> 14:16.020
hey, guess what,
I found the guy?

14:16.106 --> 14:17.221
You know, then you
wouldn't know how hard it was.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.523
Did you find the guy?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.525
Yes. Maybe.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.777
I mean, you know,
it's circumstantial.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.228
Guy's name is atticus lee.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.780
Lives right here in the city.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.866
Uh, former marine,
recipient of the purple heart,

14:27.951 --> 14:30.568
hit hard times at home,
minor possession rap

14:30.670 --> 14:32.287
made him unemployable,
so he turned to crime.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.956
Cops busted him for b and e
and stealing jewelry.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.541
Pretty sure
the box belongs to him.

14:36.626 --> 14:37.926
Harry...

14:39.095 --> 14:40.128
Yeah?

14:40.213 --> 14:41.713
I'm impressed.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.298
You have an address?

14:51.474 --> 14:52.924
You sure this is the guy?

14:53.026 --> 14:55.693
No, but...

14:55.779 --> 14:57.395
My burden of proof
isn't as high as yours.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.614
Look, you might want
to hang back for this.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.266
The information I got came...

15:02.369 --> 15:03.484
Not so legally.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.204
I don't know
anything about that.

15:06.289 --> 15:09.073
I'm just here acting on a tip
from a confidential informant.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.944
I'm not hanging back.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.379
I need answers.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.916
<i> (knocking at door)</i>

15:26.927 --> 15:28.593
(door closes)

15:29.179 --> 15:31.429
somebody was looking
for something.

15:49.683 --> 15:50.615
Blood.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.149
(footsteps running)

15:52.252 --> 15:53.418
somebody's here.

16:13.857 --> 16:16.190
(soft clatter)

16:16.309 --> 16:17.775
(door closes in distance)

16:28.238 --> 16:30.405
(gasps) it's okay.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.539
We're the good guys.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.074
Come on, baby, you're safe now.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.459
Come on.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.545
Tell me your
name, sweetie.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.580
Kelsey.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.082
Oh, that's pretty neat.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.168
If you tell us what happened,

16:44.254 --> 16:45.920
I promise we can help you.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.840
Bad men came
and broke into the house.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.744
My daddy told me to hide
in my special place.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.580
And not to come out
until he said it was okay.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.348
These men...

16:57.434 --> 16:58.599
Did you see them?

17:00.987 --> 17:03.404
But I heard them.
They were loud.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.655
What were they saying?

17:06.276 --> 17:07.525
That they wanted it back.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.245
And there were other sounds.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.031
Scary sounds.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.034
I think they were hurting him.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.252
(exhales)

17:18.371 --> 17:19.737
do you know
what happened to him?

17:19.839 --> 17:23.207
After a while, it got quiet.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.960
And I fell asleep.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.847
When I woke up,
they were all gone.

17:29.933 --> 17:32.083
And you didn't
call the police?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.519
Daddy says
never call the police.

17:34.604 --> 17:36.471
They'll take you to jail.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.389
And he told me

17:38.475 --> 17:39.807
to wait.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.559
And when I heard you,

17:41.644 --> 17:44.395
I-I thought maybe he was back.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.647
Where's your mom?

17:46.733 --> 17:49.784
I was supposed
to spend the week with her.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.571
But she got in trouble
because of drugs.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.409
Daddy and I take care
of each other.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.913
When is he coming home?

18:03.550 --> 18:04.749
Dante:
<i> What do you think?</i>

18:04.834 --> 18:07.001
I think her dad stole
from the wrong people

18:07.087 --> 18:09.137
and whatever he took,
they want it back.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.172
How does
the safe-deposit box fit in?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.457
I think he set it up
to hide stolen jewelry

18:13.560 --> 18:15.126
until he could get rid of it.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.978
That way,
if the cops searched his house,

18:17.097 --> 18:20.131
he'd be clean and they couldn't
connect him to the box.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.600
Only they may have
gotten it out of him.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.853
In which case,
atticus is already dead.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.072
Let's try to hold on
to hope a little longer.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.825
She's a brave one.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.578
I'll take her
to social services,

18:33.663 --> 18:35.246
make sure she's okay.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.914
And I'll see
if I can find her mother.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.916
Okay.
(phone ringing)

18:41.588 --> 18:42.537
yeah, what you got?

18:42.622 --> 18:44.488
Well, nothing good.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.290
That dead bank robber?

18:46.376 --> 18:48.793
The reason you can't find him?

18:48.878 --> 18:50.628
He's cia.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.804
Well, this was hard
for even me to find.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.672
I had to call
in some favors.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.808
His name is dustin dempsey.

19:03.893 --> 19:04.809
Intelligence operative,

19:04.894 --> 19:06.010
works mostly
overseas.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.528
You're saying this was cia?
No.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.563
Whatever he was doing,

19:08.648 --> 19:09.947
he was doing it off book.

19:10.033 --> 19:11.983
He's supposed to be on
a fishing trip in montana

19:12.068 --> 19:13.651
right now.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.820
So what's one of
our agents doing

19:15.905 --> 19:17.321
robbing a bank?

19:17.407 --> 19:18.990
You can tell me.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.493
I mean, dude was with a team,

19:22.579 --> 19:25.580
so maybe you could get
a list of known associates.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.831
Folks he missioned with.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.532
Oh, boy, you give
a mouse a cookie...

19:28.635 --> 19:29.917
What else you want?
His pants size

19:30.003 --> 19:30.968
and his favorite
ice cream?

19:31.054 --> 19:32.053
No, his shoe size

19:32.172 --> 19:33.387
and his favorite color.
Okay, okay.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.973
Meanwhile, you watch your back.

19:36.059 --> 19:38.009
Going up against
guys like dempsey?

19:38.094 --> 19:40.061
It's like going up
against yourself.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.763
You hear me?

19:42.849 --> 19:44.265
(clicks tongue)

20:19.552 --> 20:22.753
Uh, it's crowded
and noisy and difficult.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.895
speciously unsanitary carts,

20:30.980 --> 20:32.446
flipping off cab drivers.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.650
Yeah, well, you also like
not looking over your shoulder.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.819
And, uh, I don't know,
not being in prison?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.404
Can't I have both?

20:42.775 --> 20:44.942
So do you think rob is

20:44.994 --> 20:47.328
serious about
not doing this anymore?

20:47.413 --> 20:48.663
I don't know.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.499
I mean, this whole delilah
thing's got her rattled.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.884
Mm-hmm. What about us?

20:53.970 --> 20:55.386
I mean, if she stops,
would you want to keep doing it?

20:55.471 --> 20:56.637
I mean, we're doing
pretty good, right?

20:56.756 --> 20:59.090
Let's just focus on
what's in front of us.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.624
Are those phone records?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.293
Harry:
Yeah. I was trying

21:02.395 --> 21:04.128
to see if atticus
connected with anybody before.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.063
(alarm wailing)
what's going on?

21:07.100 --> 21:08.649
Someone's targeting my system.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.767
I'm under attack.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.019
They're through the outer layer.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.637
Who's "they"?
I don't know.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.273
Somebody must have tagged me

21:15.358 --> 21:16.774
when I was pulling up
atticus's phone records.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.309
They're through another layer.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.643
Okay, what happens
if they break through?

21:19.746 --> 21:20.811
They own the servers.

21:20.913 --> 21:21.812
They know I'm alive.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.497
Okay, I-I can't
hold them off.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.450
What are you gonna do? Harry!

21:33.676 --> 21:36.210
What in the actual--

21:44.320 --> 21:46.103
robyn:
How close did they come?

21:46.189 --> 21:47.721
Nicholson in<i> the shining</i> close.

21:47.824 --> 21:50.057
Their digital axe was
about to "here's johnny"

21:50.159 --> 21:51.392
my entire system.

21:51.494 --> 21:53.194
And it's one of
the most secure on the planet.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.445
It would take someone
with mad skills...

21:54.530 --> 21:56.030
Someone from
the intelligence community.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.832
(scoffs)

21:57.917 --> 21:59.900
I'm sorry, I thought I heard you
say "intelligence community."

22:00.003 --> 22:01.568
the guys that attacked atticus,

22:01.671 --> 22:02.736
that hit the bank,

22:02.839 --> 22:04.372
one was rogue cia.
Oh, no.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.623
No, no, no.

22:05.708 --> 22:07.758
See, I didn't spend
five years underground

22:07.877 --> 22:09.543
living like a mole person
just to throw it

22:09.629 --> 22:10.628
all away.
Harry...

22:10.713 --> 22:12.213
No, no. No.
I mean, maybe if someone

22:12.298 --> 22:14.048
doesn't want us looking into it
this badly, we shouldn't be.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.716
Babe, you're vacillating wildly.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.018
I'm vacillating wildly

22:17.103 --> 22:18.469
because they almost found me.
Robyn: Harry.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.754
They killed cops,

22:20.857 --> 22:21.972
took a little girl's father

22:22.058 --> 22:23.757
and, yes, they
came after you.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.559
Don't you want to know why?

22:25.645 --> 22:27.445
Hmm?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.263
Okay. All right, okay, look.

22:29.365 --> 22:31.565
If I end up in jail,
you both are breaking me out.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.901
You know we can.
Okay, whatever.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.619
So... What triggered the attack?

22:35.738 --> 22:38.489
I was downloading
atticus's phone records.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.107
Somebody must have set
a trip wire on the account.

22:40.209 --> 22:41.625
Tell me you managed
to get the records.

22:41.744 --> 22:44.245
Yeah. Atticus called one number

22:44.330 --> 22:46.247
the past few days,
but he called it several times,

22:46.332 --> 22:48.132
so I did a web search and

22:48.251 --> 22:50.051
it belongs
to a martin navarro.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.470
He's got a phd in
agricultural sciences

22:52.588 --> 22:53.838
from cornell
and he runs

22:53.923 --> 22:55.639
a latin american nonprofit.

22:55.758 --> 22:58.259
So why would their paths cross?

22:59.762 --> 23:01.345
(phone ringing)

23:02.398 --> 23:03.681
hey.

23:03.766 --> 23:04.965
How's the girl?

23:05.068 --> 23:07.151
Still shaky,
but I finally got her to open up

23:07.270 --> 23:08.936
about where
she and her dad had been

23:09.021 --> 23:10.438
the last couple of days.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.156
Two days ago,
they visited a guy

23:12.275 --> 23:13.524
her dad called uncle mike

23:13.609 --> 23:14.942
at a pawn shop.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.878
Turns out
uncle mike is atticus's fence.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.830
Atticus was looking
to unload a few things,

23:19.949 --> 23:21.749
including a pair
of gold cufflinks

23:21.851 --> 23:23.451
with the congressional seal
on them.

23:24.921 --> 23:26.036
He stole from a congressman.

23:26.122 --> 23:27.955
Not just any congressman.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.340
One of new york's own.

23:29.459 --> 23:30.824
Along with the cufflinks,

23:30.927 --> 23:34.161
atticus had a watch engraved
with the initials "s.A.G."

23:34.263 --> 23:36.180
s.A.G.

23:37.884 --> 23:38.966
Sanford ganis,

23:39.051 --> 23:41.001
chair of the house
intelligence committee?

23:41.104 --> 23:43.637
Yeah. I checked police records.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.107
No one reported a robbery
at his park slope residence,

23:46.192 --> 23:48.476
which means either ganis doesn't
know he was robbed, or...

23:48.561 --> 23:49.693
Or he didn't
want it reported.

23:49.812 --> 23:52.113
Ganis is home for the recess.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.847
I'm headed to him now
to find out which.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.066
Okay. Well, I gotta run down
a lead of my own,

23:56.152 --> 23:58.285
so... We'll connect after.

24:05.161 --> 24:07.545
No, we are
not rewriting that bill.

24:07.663 --> 24:08.829
And if they don't like it,

24:08.931 --> 24:09.914
they can go on the record.
Congressman ganis.

24:09.999 --> 24:12.199
Detective dante.
I just need a quick

24:12.301 --> 24:13.534
minute with the congressman.

24:13.636 --> 24:15.536
Unless that's a problem.
No.

24:15.638 --> 24:18.539
Always happy to help our
friends in law enforcement.

24:18.641 --> 24:19.974
Appreciate it.

24:20.076 --> 24:21.475
Just wondering
if you had a break-in

24:21.577 --> 24:23.511
at your house
or office this weekend.

24:23.613 --> 24:25.479
Break-in?
No, why?

24:25.581 --> 24:28.315
Came across this as
a part of another investigation.

24:28.401 --> 24:29.433
I believe it's yours.

24:29.519 --> 24:30.901
Where'd you find it?

24:31.020 --> 24:33.904
Can't share that yet.
The investigation's ongoing.

24:33.990 --> 24:35.990
Just trying to pinpoint
when it might have been taken.

24:36.058 --> 24:39.994
Ah. Uh, that? About a year ago,
from a gym locker.

24:41.164 --> 24:42.096
Gym locker.

24:42.198 --> 24:44.231
I assume you filed
a police report.

24:44.333 --> 24:45.900
You guys have more
important things to do

24:46.002 --> 24:47.535
than chase down a watch.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.403
$25,000 watch.

24:49.505 --> 24:52.122
You'd at least need a report
for an insurance claim.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.842
Chalked it up to life tax.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.043
But, hey,
now that you have it,

24:56.128 --> 24:57.744
do you think maybe
I can get that back?

24:57.847 --> 24:58.963
Of course.

24:59.048 --> 25:00.881
Once we're done
with our investigation.

25:01.851 --> 25:03.267
Thank you for your time.

25:11.494 --> 25:14.695
Mr. Navarro, can I speak
with you for a moment?

25:16.482 --> 25:18.765
I'd like to ask you
about atticus lee.

25:18.784 --> 25:19.766
Who?

25:19.785 --> 25:21.318
Atticus lee?

25:22.538 --> 25:25.489
He's called you multiple times
in the past few days.

25:25.541 --> 25:27.491
You know him?

25:27.543 --> 25:28.742
You know who he is?

25:28.777 --> 25:30.211
Please, I need to speak
with him right away.

25:30.246 --> 25:33.547
Why?
Because he knows
who killed my wife.

25:33.583 --> 25:37.301
Noelle was a reporter
with idr news.

25:37.336 --> 25:40.087
A couple of months ago,
she found something--

25:40.122 --> 25:44.225
evidence that members of
the u.S. Intelligence community

25:44.260 --> 25:45.676
were behind the assassination

25:45.728 --> 25:47.811
of president flores
in cortuguay.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.496
And it was done
without the knowledge

25:49.532 --> 25:51.682
or consent of congress
or the white house.

25:51.734 --> 25:53.300
A rogue operation.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.070
Sponsored by u.S. Corporations.

25:56.105 --> 25:59.206
Flores was blocking hundreds
of american business contracts.

25:59.242 --> 26:01.642
Well, someone must have
authorized it.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.827
Noelle had linked
the operation to

26:03.863 --> 26:05.079
a powerful member of congress.

26:05.114 --> 26:06.480
She was on
her way home

26:06.499 --> 26:08.365
from the airport with proof

26:08.417 --> 26:09.617
when her car went off the road.

26:09.652 --> 26:13.254
Emergency crews
found her body at the scene.

26:13.289 --> 26:16.040
No files were found
in the car.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.559
Police ruled it
an accident, but...

26:18.594 --> 26:20.494
But someone ran her
off the road.

26:20.513 --> 26:22.546
Only I had no way of proving it

26:22.598 --> 26:24.098
until I got that phone call.

26:24.133 --> 26:26.216
What exactly did atticus say?

26:26.269 --> 26:27.384
That he had evidence

26:27.436 --> 26:29.386
proving noelle was murdered.

26:29.438 --> 26:31.672
He said
he was a soldier once

26:31.691 --> 26:33.807
and that he-- he felt a duty
to do what was right,

26:33.842 --> 26:35.309
but that he couldn't
do it himself.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.778
So we arranged to meet, but...

26:37.813 --> 26:39.980
He never showed.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.315
So atticus robs
the congressman's house,

26:41.350 --> 26:42.399
empties his safe...

26:42.451 --> 26:44.851
Not realizing
that he's taking evidence

26:44.870 --> 26:46.036
linking the congressman

26:46.072 --> 26:47.571
to the assassination
of a foreign leader.

26:47.623 --> 26:49.156
Which is why
he didn't report it.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.041
Instead, the congressman calls
his people to get it back.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.694
And they'll do anything to make
sure it never comes to light,

26:53.796 --> 26:55.045
no matter who they have to kill.

26:55.164 --> 26:56.330
Only we could never prove it.

26:56.415 --> 26:57.831
They're going to get away
with this, aren't they?

26:57.917 --> 27:00.534
Rogue intelligence agents,
a senior member in congress?

27:00.636 --> 27:02.536
Tell me, how the hell am I
supposed to go up against that?

27:02.638 --> 27:04.305
You can't.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.339
And you can?

27:05.424 --> 27:07.474
People like them?

27:07.560 --> 27:10.511
They're the reason why I'm
doing this in the first place.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.596
They think they're untouchable.

27:12.682 --> 27:15.983
They don't care who lives
or dies, including cops.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.818
It's not right.

27:17.903 --> 27:20.571
So since they don't play
by the rules, neither can I.

27:20.690 --> 27:21.722
So what happens next?

27:21.824 --> 27:23.357
-(tires squealing)
-get down!

27:36.005 --> 27:37.421
They followed you.

27:38.424 --> 27:39.740
All I did was ask
some questions.

27:39.842 --> 27:42.376
Yeah, the kind of questions
that get you killed.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.927
Send the boys to their mom's.

27:44.046 --> 27:45.346
Don't go home.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.715
Pick a hotel at random,
pay in cash

27:47.800 --> 27:48.766
and turn off
the gps in your phone.

27:48.884 --> 27:50.050
For how long?

27:50.136 --> 27:51.552
Until you hear from me.
This isn't right.

27:51.637 --> 27:52.886
I'm a cop.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.355
I'm the one who's supposed
to be investigating.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.859
You'll have your moment,
but right now, it's my turn.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.029
(line ringing)

28:03.065 --> 28:04.365
hi, you've reached bishop.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.899
Please leave a message.
(beeps)

28:05.985 --> 28:07.701
yeah, bishop.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.936
I know you're running
dempsey's associates.

28:10.039 --> 28:12.072
Can you let me know
if any of 'em connect

28:12.158 --> 28:14.541
to a congressman,
sanford ganis?

28:14.627 --> 28:16.326
All right,
call me back as soon as you can.

28:21.217 --> 28:22.416
Dee?

28:24.303 --> 28:26.220
Hey, mom.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.337
We need to talk.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.132
I got your messages.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.085
I wanted to call back, but...

28:42.188 --> 28:43.303
(inhales)

28:43.389 --> 28:45.389
I mean, I wasn't sure
who I was calling.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.308
My mom,
who drives carpool,

28:48.394 --> 28:51.562
or some ex-spy turned avenger,

28:51.647 --> 28:53.263
who's a complete stranger.

28:54.283 --> 28:56.984
Delilah, no matter what I do,
I'm always your mom.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.603
No, but you lied to me.
Okay? For years.

28:59.705 --> 29:01.822
Because I had to.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.991
It would have been dangerous
for you to know.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.325
It is dangerous.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.977
Okay, and what about all
that time you were away, mom?

29:07.079 --> 29:08.145
All those moments
in my life

29:08.247 --> 29:09.163
you weren't there,

29:09.248 --> 29:10.581
running around the world.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.715
While aunt vi
and I were here,

29:11.801 --> 29:12.916
living our boring
little lives.

29:13.002 --> 29:15.886
My life is not boring,
or little.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.554
And that is no way
to be speaking to me

29:17.640 --> 29:18.756
or your mother.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.090
(laughs):
Why?

29:20.176 --> 29:21.425
What?
She gonna waterboard me?

29:21.510 --> 29:23.594
Hey, that is enough.

29:23.696 --> 29:25.962
You will show some respect
in this house.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.765
Number one, you do not have
the moral high ground

29:27.850 --> 29:29.433
you think you have, little girl.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.318
Number two,
you were sneaking around

29:31.437 --> 29:33.020
and you found something
you were not ready to see.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.022
That's on you.

29:35.107 --> 29:38.475
Number three,
you are too young

29:38.577 --> 29:40.811
and too sheltered
to have a clue

29:40.913 --> 29:42.446
as to what you are saying,

29:42.531 --> 29:44.031
so this is what it is.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.582
I am your mother.

29:46.836 --> 29:48.585
And I'm not going
to make excuses

29:48.671 --> 29:50.454
and apologies for what I do.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.424
I've done what I can
to keep this country safe.

29:54.510 --> 29:56.627
And I've done my best
to keep you safe.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.546
Dee, there are things
in this world that I hoped

29:59.632 --> 30:01.348
I could protect you from.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.051
Things that no one
should have to experience.

30:05.187 --> 30:06.303
Like jason.

30:09.642 --> 30:13.343
And it is my job
to make them right.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.282
It's what I was put on
this earth to do.

30:20.069 --> 30:24.071
But none of that takes away
from how much I love you.

30:27.459 --> 30:28.759
Dee...

30:30.129 --> 30:32.329
You've been through
so much, so quickly.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.199
Just... Just by itself,

30:36.302 --> 30:39.303
seeing your friend shot,
losing him...

30:39.405 --> 30:41.705
I know you're reeling.

30:41.807 --> 30:44.391
Which is why you should be
running to us, baby.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.709
Not away from us.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.261
But...

30:49.899 --> 30:52.900
...How can I trust
either one of you again?

30:52.985 --> 30:55.102
That's something
you're gonna have to decide.

30:56.739 --> 30:57.905
And now that you know
my secrets,

30:58.023 --> 31:00.274
you're gonna have to grow up
just a little faster

31:00.359 --> 31:01.942
than what we would've hoped.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.360
But, um...

31:03.445 --> 31:05.445
Maybe we can just start by

31:05.531 --> 31:07.664
giving each other
the benefit of the doubt.

31:08.667 --> 31:11.001
Just being honest
with each other.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.120
(horn honking outside)

31:15.291 --> 31:16.790
that's dad.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.800
You know where we stand.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.251
You give respect,

31:28.354 --> 31:29.486
you get respect.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.388
Just think about it.

31:37.947 --> 31:39.730
(robyn sighs)

31:39.815 --> 31:40.964
as hard as this is,

31:41.066 --> 31:43.433
I understand how
she feels. Sometimes,

31:43.535 --> 31:46.286
I wish I could un-know
what I know.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.156
(phone ringing)

31:50.409 --> 31:52.776
whatever that is...

31:52.878 --> 31:54.211
Be safe.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.501
(sighs)

32:01.587 --> 32:02.803
yeah, bishop, what you got?

32:02.922 --> 32:05.389
Okay, that connection
you were looking for?

32:05.474 --> 32:06.757
I think I found it.

32:06.842 --> 32:10.126
Congressman ganis's chief
of staff, remy hollenbach.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.512
I'm going to text you his photo.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.247
(phone chimes)

32:14.333 --> 32:17.434
now, hollenbach was
a former cia operations officer

32:17.519 --> 32:19.186
until he turned to politics.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.487
Guess who he served with?

32:20.572 --> 32:21.772
My dead bank robber.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.523
They were in
the same tactical unit,

32:23.642 --> 32:25.492
doing covert ops
about a decade ago.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.610
Hollenbach sounds like

32:26.695 --> 32:28.328
just the kind of guy
you want for

32:28.447 --> 32:30.163
a rogue intelligence operation.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.815
Except this is classified.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.785
None of it can be used
legally to connect any dots.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.837
Oh, don't worry.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.755
I'll connect the dots.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.469
Oh! (gasps)

32:52.571 --> 32:53.854
are you kidding me?

32:53.973 --> 32:55.572
You need to watch
where you're going.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.241
You need to get off
your phone, jackhole.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.643
(groans)

33:00.713 --> 33:01.611
we good?

33:01.714 --> 33:04.147
Yep, tracking is active.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.983
We have audio.

33:06.068 --> 33:07.401
He's in the building.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.653
He should be
in his office by now.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.238
All right.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.540
Let's see where we stand.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.159
(phone dials, line ringing)

33:16.245 --> 33:17.794
woman:
Congressman ganis's office.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.913
Hello, may I speak
with congressman ganis?

33:19.999 --> 33:21.381
Tell him it's
atticus lee.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.033
He'll know what it's regarding.

33:23.135 --> 33:26.036
(indistinct conversation)

33:26.138 --> 33:27.838
woman:
Uh, hold-- hold, please.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.674
(beeping)
well, that struck a nerve.
They're tracing the call.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.375
Knock, knock,
you son of a bitch.

33:33.262 --> 33:35.729
All right, let's see exactly
how big a nerve we struck.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.180
Turn up the volume
on that bug.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.381
Hollenback:
Trace failed.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.067
Ganis:
She called herself atticus lee.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.235
She was sending me
a message, which means

33:42.354 --> 33:44.354
she knows.
Hollenback: Or was fishing.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.689
Gainis:
First the cop, now this?

33:45.774 --> 33:46.990
We need to close up shop.

33:47.076 --> 33:48.408
I want this to be over.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.360
Hollenbach: Atticus can't
hold on much longer.

33:50.446 --> 33:52.162
One way or another,
we'll finish this today.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.697
Atticus is alive.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.198
Which means they don't
have the evidence.

33:55.284 --> 33:56.900
He lied to them
about the bank.

33:57.002 --> 33:59.569
He's been lying to them
to stay alive.

33:59.671 --> 34:00.921
Because he knows
once they have it...

34:01.040 --> 34:02.622
Yeah. They'll kill him.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.758
If we can save atticus,
we can end this.

34:04.877 --> 34:06.076
All right.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.210
(dialing)

34:08.130 --> 34:09.129
who-who you calling?

34:09.214 --> 34:11.181
Dante.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.949
He deserves
to be a part of this.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.885
(car lock chirps)

34:19.224 --> 34:21.475
him?
Yep.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.062
And he's gonna lead us
straight to atticus.

34:26.031 --> 34:27.697
(engine starts)

34:38.410 --> 34:40.577
♪ ♪

34:43.999 --> 34:44.915
a sentry.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.583
Atticus must be inside.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.418
We need to call esu.

34:48.504 --> 34:49.653
Oh, no good.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.556
That guy'd spot
a swat team a mile away.

34:52.641 --> 34:54.758
Atticus would be dead
before they hit the front door.

34:54.843 --> 34:56.259
I'm gonna have
to do this one solo.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.812
Mm, you're not doing anything,
not without backup.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.430
These aren't common criminals.

35:00.482 --> 35:01.982
These are highly trained mercs.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.800
All the more reason.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.352
Someone's gotta have your back.

35:06.905 --> 35:09.239
I can handle myself.

35:11.110 --> 35:13.610
All right.
But if you get shot...

35:13.695 --> 35:14.778
I'll kill you.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.329
Understood.

35:17.533 --> 35:18.849
Now, what's the plan?

35:18.951 --> 35:21.751
How's your handles?

35:29.962 --> 35:31.178
(grunts)

35:33.515 --> 35:35.098
well...

35:35.184 --> 35:36.266
Nice assist.

35:36.351 --> 35:37.667
Hell of a pick-and-roll.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.906
Don't make this
harder on yourself.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.542
Just tell me where you hid
those notebooks and the drive.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.634
(electricity crackles)

36:12.471 --> 36:14.471
(groaning)

36:14.556 --> 36:15.972
(atticus screaming)

36:16.058 --> 36:18.091
we've got to stop this.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.893
I can't get
a clean shot.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.312
Gotta take out
all three of them.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.481
(coughing)

36:24.566 --> 36:26.549
hollenbach:
You can end this, atticus.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.652
It's in your control. Huh?

36:28.737 --> 36:29.686
Where is it?

36:29.771 --> 36:30.987
Over there.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.574
He's toast.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.942
Kill him.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.361
Burn the body.
Leave no trace.

36:38.447 --> 36:39.863
Yes, sir.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.836
(grunting)

36:50.375 --> 36:52.676
(gunshot ricochets)
get him out of here.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.714
(gunshots, gun clicking)

37:05.440 --> 37:06.473
(grunts)

37:07.976 --> 37:10.110
(grunting)

37:16.101 --> 37:17.484
(grunts)
who are you?

37:17.569 --> 37:19.236
The one who's gonna
take you down.

37:31.833 --> 37:35.168
You... Were... Wrong.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.088
(gunshot)

37:42.511 --> 37:43.459
you okay?

37:43.562 --> 37:45.895
(exhales) yeah.

37:45.981 --> 37:46.980
Atticus?

37:47.099 --> 37:48.765
Alive.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.183
And ready to end this.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.319
(sighs)

37:52.437 --> 37:53.903
hey, dante...

37:53.989 --> 37:55.355
Thanks.

38:00.495 --> 38:01.811
Dante: Finished
that investigation.

38:01.913 --> 38:04.047
Thought I'd bring this back.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.916
Also brought these.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.369
They belong to
a friend of mine.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.520
She was murdered
because of you.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.005
Sanford ganis...

38:12.124 --> 38:14.658
You're under arrest
for accessory to

38:14.760 --> 38:16.710
the murder of
a peace officer...

38:17.929 --> 38:20.380
...The murder of
journalist noelle navarro

38:20.465 --> 38:23.216
and the kidnapping
of atticus lee.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.001
You can't arrest me.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.070
Do you people have
any idea who I am?

38:27.139 --> 38:30.140
Yeah, I know who you are.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.975
I also know what you are.

38:39.868 --> 38:41.184
(gasps)

38:41.286 --> 38:42.902
ah.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.454
Oh...

38:46.074 --> 38:47.457
(atticus laughs)

38:50.545 --> 38:51.995
(giggles)

38:54.583 --> 38:55.999
dante:
<i> You were right.</i>

38:56.101 --> 38:57.167
Atticus knew they were
going to kill him

38:57.252 --> 38:58.301
once they got
what they needed.

38:58.387 --> 39:00.837
So he told every lie
he could to buy time.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.923
Only thing that kept
him going was the hope

39:04.042 --> 39:05.392
of seeing his daughter again.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.977
He sent them to that bank box
hoping they'd get caught.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.314
Didn't mean to cost
anybody their lives.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.651
Well, he also said

39:14.736 --> 39:17.921
someone helped him land
a legit job at the va.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.857
Any idea who that
might have been?

39:20.909 --> 39:22.558
I may have made a call.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.662
And thanks to atticus,
congressman ganis will be

39:25.747 --> 39:27.614
going away for
a very long time.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.332
Atticus...

39:29.418 --> 39:31.785
And you.

39:33.121 --> 39:34.704
Thank you.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.623
For helping me get justice
for my people.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.574
That's it?

39:38.677 --> 39:40.427
Thank you? (chuckles)

39:40.545 --> 39:42.679
no lecture
about my methods.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.715
The world's a messy place.

39:47.102 --> 39:50.186
I'm hired by the people
to uphold the law.

39:50.272 --> 39:53.056
If I cross that line,
no matter how well-intentioned,

39:53.141 --> 39:54.391
I violate trust.

39:56.645 --> 39:57.894
But you're right.

39:59.364 --> 40:01.030
Sometimes we can't help.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.151
Maybe the world does need you.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.492
"the world needs you"?

40:12.577 --> 40:13.793
Dante really said that?

40:13.912 --> 40:14.911
Here.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.779
Sounds like we have a new ally.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.915
We'll see.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.950
So what happens now?
(sighs)

40:21.052 --> 40:23.803
do we take that pause
or keep going?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.555
(sighs)

40:25.640 --> 40:26.756
we keep going.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.959
What about, uh,
overexposure?

40:30.061 --> 40:31.978
Let 'em come.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.596
We'll stay one step
ahead of 'em.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.735
Hey, so, um...

40:38.837 --> 40:40.636
Seeing as how you're
back in the saddle again,

40:40.739 --> 40:42.772
you feel ready
to take on a new client?

40:42.858 --> 40:44.474
You got one?

40:44.576 --> 40:46.242
Uh-huh. Me.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.579
I want you to resurrect me.

40:49.664 --> 40:50.663
Being dead is killing me.

40:50.782 --> 40:51.865
Are you serious, babe?

40:51.950 --> 40:53.199
A hundred percent.

40:53.285 --> 40:57.003
I just want to live again,
preferably without being

40:57.122 --> 40:59.489
arrested by the feds
for leaking military secrets.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.624
That's a tall order, harry.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.426
I know.

41:03.512 --> 41:05.128
Look... (sighs)

41:05.213 --> 41:06.679
getting the band back together?

41:06.798 --> 41:08.865
Man, it's been the best thing
to happen to me since I died.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.700
I just don't want to
have to keep hiding.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.019
You know? And I don't want
to feel as vulnerable

41:13.138 --> 41:15.305
as I felt
yesterday, right?

41:15.390 --> 41:17.190
So I'm asking, rob...

41:19.377 --> 41:20.810
Help me live again.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.648
Yeah, I'll try.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.751
But it might take a while.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.320
That's all right.

41:30.405 --> 41:32.038
Not going anywhere.

41:35.327 --> 41:36.493
Okay.

41:50.392 --> 41:52.175
(key rattles in lock)

41:58.266 --> 41:59.816
dee.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.234
Hey.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.904
Um...

42:05.023 --> 42:06.940
I thought about what you said.

42:08.260 --> 42:10.109
About... (sighs)

42:10.195 --> 42:13.079
...Giving each other
the benefit of the doubt,

42:13.164 --> 42:16.933
and I realized I
never thanked you

42:17.035 --> 42:18.868
for what you did for jason.

42:20.205 --> 42:22.171
Look, who you are...

42:22.257 --> 42:24.457
What you are...

42:24.543 --> 42:27.544
It's a lot, and...

42:28.880 --> 42:31.764
I don't know
how to get used to it.

42:33.952 --> 42:35.552
But you're my mom.

42:37.973 --> 42:40.023
And...

42:41.693 --> 42:43.826
...I want to come home.
(sighs)

42:45.430 --> 42:46.563
can I come home?

42:46.648 --> 42:48.364
Of course you can
come home, baby.

42:53.822 --> 42:56.155
(whispers):
Don't cry, don't cry.
