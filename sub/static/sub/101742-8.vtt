WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:02.480
- I swear it never stops.
I finish a memo,

00:02.524 --> 00:03.873
boom,
I need to write a brief.

00:03.916 --> 00:05.788
I finish the brief, boom,
I need to draft a motion.

00:05.831 --> 00:08.660
Then that jackass Snyder
tears it all apart.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.619
He says my writing
is pedestrian,

00:10.662 --> 00:12.316
my research is outdated.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.232
- Maybe it's time
to start looking around,

00:15.276 --> 00:17.669
find a smaller firm,
less pressure.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.280
- Less money too.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.630
- We don't have
to buy the condo.

00:21.673 --> 00:24.850
We can stay where we're at,
rent for a few more years.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.418
<i>- Money
is the root of all evil,</i>

00:27.462 --> 00:29.812
<i>the reason people suffer.</i>

00:29.855 --> 00:32.815
<i>We must stop the exploitation
of the working man</i>

00:32.858 --> 00:34.599
<i>and the pain we suffer.</i>

00:34.643 --> 00:37.167
<i>To do that,
we need to make them suffer,</i>

00:37.211 --> 00:39.604
<i>make them feel our pain...</i>

00:40.692 --> 00:42.781
- What the hell?

00:42.825 --> 00:44.783
Anyone call 911?

00:44.827 --> 00:46.655
- Yeah, five minutes ago.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.874
<i>- Money is the root
of all evil...</i>

00:53.096 --> 00:55.098
- Gotta go to the other side!

00:58.145 --> 00:59.624
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, girl.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.496
- Okay, let's clear the area.
Go, go, go.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.629
- Come on, Tess.
Here you go.

01:04.673 --> 01:08.111
Hit. Hit.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.982
There you go, Tess.
Search.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.506
Got something?
-

01:11.549 --> 01:13.856
- Good girl.
Front tire.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.336
<i>- We must stop
the exploitation</i>

01:15.379 --> 01:17.816
<i>of the working man
and the pain we suffer.</i>

01:17.860 --> 01:21.429
<i>To do that,
we need to make them suffer.</i>

01:21.472 --> 01:23.126
- Just some idiot making
a political statement.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.433
Look at this.
- Yeah, real fresh.

01:25.476 --> 01:28.697
Rich people suck?
Never heard that before.

01:28.740 --> 01:29.828
- Oh!

01:40.665 --> 01:43.364
- So the car was parked
right there,

01:43.407 --> 01:45.409
detonated at 7:27.
There's three dead.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.411
Still trying to ID them.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.673
- Techs know what kind
of bomb it was?

01:48.717 --> 01:49.935
- Well, I mean the car
was blown to pieces.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.415
We don't even know
the make and model yet.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.635
- Any idea
what this is all about?

01:53.678 --> 01:56.159
- Right now,
it appears to be political.

01:56.203 --> 01:59.336
There was anti-capitalist audio
playing down the block.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.079
Hey.
Any witnesses?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.473
- Yeah, but they all
had their eyes and ears

02:05.516 --> 02:06.778
glued to the gold car.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.519
You know,
the whole Nashville thing.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.478
- Which is probably why
they did it that way

02:10.521 --> 02:11.827
and created a diversion

02:11.870 --> 02:13.655
50 yards
from the actual crime scene.

02:13.698 --> 02:17.615
- All while spreading
their gospel at the same time.

02:17.659 --> 02:18.877
Okay.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.272
- All right, people,
listen up!

02:22.316 --> 02:24.231
We got the names
of our victims.

02:24.274 --> 02:27.190
Number one, Mark Heller,
51, male, white,

02:27.234 --> 02:29.192
he worked
in commercial real estate.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.455
Janet White, 37, female, Black.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.718
She was a nurse
at Mt. Sinai Hospital.

02:33.762 --> 02:37.157
And Benjamin Lopez, 26,
male Hispanic.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.854
He was a law student at NYU.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.899
Let's dig into
these three people.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.337
Was this a random attack,
or were these people targeted?

02:43.380 --> 02:45.861
Was one of our victims
perchance the bomber?

02:45.904 --> 02:48.385
I don't know.
Let's get to work.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.300
Kelly, Elise,
let's make sure we pull

02:50.344 --> 02:51.910
as much surveillance video
as possible

02:51.954 --> 02:53.216
from around the bomb site

02:53.260 --> 02:55.044
and the gold car
that had the audio recording.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.742
Whoever planted that device
likely planted the bomb too.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.396
- Hey, Jubal?
- Yeah?

02:59.440 --> 03:00.789
- I have something interesting

03:00.832 --> 03:02.182
across the street
from the site.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.271
- Great, put it up.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.229
- There's a guy
pacing back and forth.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.579
He seems real agitated,

03:10.015 --> 03:12.496
he pulls his phone out at 7:27,
presses a button.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.629
Let's presume for the moment
he presses send.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.674
He then turns and hurries off
in the opposite direction.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.023
Seconds later,
the bomb detonates.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.590
- Can you get a clear shot
of his face?

03:19.634 --> 03:22.202
- Running that
through facial rec now.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.860
Got it.
Nicholas Katz.

03:28.904 --> 03:31.254
Poly-sci professor
at the New School.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.777
There's three prior arrests

03:32.821 --> 03:35.693
all in the last 18 months
and all for curfew violations.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.782
- Okay, so he's an activist.
- And a member

03:37.826 --> 03:39.262
of the Democratic Socialists
of America.

03:39.306 --> 03:42.091
- Which would explain
the anti-capitalist recording.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.180
Let's get an address.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.010
- Green!

03:48.053 --> 03:49.751
-
- FBI!

03:51.448 --> 03:52.841
Federal agents!

03:52.884 --> 03:55.452
- Move!
Go, go, go, go!

03:55.496 --> 03:58.368
- Put the gun down now!
- Drop the weapon!

03:58.412 --> 04:00.544
- Oh, my God.
- Negative contact.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.764
We're clear!
- Turn off the video game.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.290
Take off your headphones.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.987
- Okay, what the hell
is going on?

04:09.031 --> 04:10.467
- We need to talk to you
about the bomb

04:10.511 --> 04:11.990
that exploded in Queens,

04:12.034 --> 04:15.472
so keep your hands where
I can see them and do not move.

04:15.516 --> 04:18.649
- I had nothing to do
with that bomb.

04:18.693 --> 04:19.998
This is ridiculous.

04:20.042 --> 04:21.696
- Well, we have you on video
near the site

04:21.739 --> 04:23.828
pacing back and forth,
looking at your phone,

04:23.872 --> 04:25.569
then seconds
before the bomb explodes,

04:25.613 --> 04:27.441
you scurry off
in the opposite direction.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.269
So it doesn't seem
that ridiculous to me.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.577
I was supposed
to meet my girlfriend--

04:33.621 --> 04:35.797
my-ex girlfriend for dinner,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.799
but she kept changing her mind.

04:37.842 --> 04:39.627
She wanted to come,
she didn't wanna come,

04:39.670 --> 04:41.281
so finally I just took off.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.847
- While you were waiting
for your ex,

04:42.891 --> 04:45.023
did you happen to see anyone
or anything suspicious?

04:45.067 --> 04:47.809
- I did,
but I'm loathe to discuss it

04:47.852 --> 04:50.942
because it's pure speculation.
- What does that mean?

04:50.986 --> 04:53.293
- It means I saw a guy
standing on the corner

04:53.336 --> 04:54.859
staring at a building.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.862
He never moved,
he just stood there watching,

04:57.906 --> 05:00.604
and then right before
the bomb went off,

05:00.648 --> 05:01.692
he took off running.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.912
- What did he look like?
-

05:03.955 --> 05:06.175
He appeared to be
Middle Eastern,

05:06.218 --> 05:08.612
dark hair, dark skin.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.484
- And you didn't tell anyone?

05:10.527 --> 05:11.963
You didn't think
to call the police?

05:12.007 --> 05:13.704
- I'm sorry,
what was I supposed to do?

05:13.748 --> 05:15.532
Call 9-1-1 and say,

05:15.576 --> 05:17.708
"Oh, I saw a suspicious
Middle Eastern dude

05:17.752 --> 05:19.928
running down the street"?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.147
- Yeah.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.367
That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.717
- It's not 2001.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.806
No more
"See Something, Say Something."

05:28.850 --> 05:30.721
What if I were wrong?
Then what?

05:30.765 --> 05:32.375
What, I become
the new posterchild

05:32.419 --> 05:34.377
for anti-Muslim hate?

05:34.421 --> 05:36.248
No, gracias.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.991
- Yup, back at you.
Hey, guys.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.689
Hey, Rina, hey.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.038
I-I didn't--
- Yeah.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.867
I, uh, got back
to counterterrorism last week.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.738
I was gonna text you, but...

05:47.782 --> 05:50.785
- Yeah, no worries.
I'm glad you're back.

05:51.786 --> 05:52.830
- Good to see you again,
Isobel.

05:52.874 --> 05:56.094
- Yeah, you too.
- So where we at?

05:56.138 --> 05:58.619
- We have a witness who saw
a Middle Eastern looking man

05:58.662 --> 06:01.622
exit a black Chrysler,
loiter for a few moments,

06:01.665 --> 06:03.580
and then took off
seconds before

06:03.624 --> 06:06.191
that same
black Chrysler detonated.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.585
- Yeah. We've been looking
for more surveillance video,

06:08.629 --> 06:10.457
but so far,
we've been striking out.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.110
- Well, we're striking out
over here too.

06:12.154 --> 06:13.938
No chatter, no intel,
but we're reaching out

06:13.982 --> 06:16.027
to our various assets
to see what they know.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.160
- Okay, great.
We'll work this together then.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.988
- Yeah.
- Great, thanks.

06:20.031 --> 06:23.295
Hey, I'm really glad
you're here.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.819
- Yeah, I'm excited.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.821
It's a new chapter, you know?

06:26.864 --> 06:29.650
Kinda feels like
anything's possible.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.652
- Right.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.786
Y'all got something, huh?

06:35.830 --> 06:38.702
- Bomb Techs were able to
cobble together the VIN number.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.661
His car was reported stolen
yesterday afternoon

06:40.704 --> 06:42.053
outside a hardware store
in Queens.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.012
- And, Boss,
I pulled some camera footage.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.709
There's the car.
Now watch this guy.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.320
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, any hits on facial rec?

06:48.364 --> 06:49.670
- No, he never turns around.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.802
- But he was holding
a full cup of coffee.

06:51.846 --> 06:54.196
Steam, small sips,
limited head tilt.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.546
Roast & Bean,
café three doors down.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.895
I had them send over
credit card data

06:57.939 --> 06:59.810
of all purchases within
15 minutes of the theft.

06:59.854 --> 07:02.334
Only one Middle Eastern
Rob Salem.

07:02.378 --> 07:05.076
I just ran it through the DMV
for approximate age, height...

07:05.120 --> 07:06.817
- That looks like
a match to me.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.211
Get the address over to
Scola and Tiffany--good work.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.347
- FBI.
We got a few questions.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.175
- Hey.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.960
Don't be stupid, Rob.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.396
- I wasn't gonna.
- Mmm.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.006
- What can I do for you?

07:23.530 --> 07:24.835
- You can tell us why

07:24.879 --> 07:26.402
you stole a black Chrysler
yesterday.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.012
- Excuse me?
-

07:28.056 --> 07:30.101
And we got the whole thing
on video.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.276
- You know,
if you're gonna steal a car,

07:31.320 --> 07:32.626
you probably shouldn't
buy coffee first.

07:32.669 --> 07:33.975
- And if you do,

07:34.018 --> 07:36.107
you definitely shouldn't
pay with a credit card.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.895
- Okay, yeah, I stole the car.

07:40.938 --> 07:43.463
- What'd you do
after you stole it?

07:43.506 --> 07:44.681
- Drove it back to Astoria,

07:44.725 --> 07:46.378
corner of 30th and 42nd.

07:46.422 --> 07:49.033
Met the guy who asked me
to do it, got paid, went home.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.687
- Who's the guy?
- Don't know.

07:50.731 --> 07:51.862
- Oh, yeah, really?

07:51.906 --> 07:53.385
That's the best
you could do for me?

07:53.429 --> 07:55.823
- Look, man, I was just hanging
out smoking a cigarette.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.215
This guy starts talking to me,

07:57.259 --> 07:58.913
bums a smoke,
we start chatting.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.523
Next thing I know he says,
"You steal me a car

08:00.567 --> 08:03.134
in the next hour, I'll give you
1,000 bucks, cash."

08:03.178 --> 08:04.788
It's crazy I know,
but it's the truth.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.140
- What did he look like?

08:09.184 --> 08:10.838
- Dark hair, brown eyes,

08:10.881 --> 08:12.535
thin, about my height.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.582
- Middle Eastern?
-

08:15.625 --> 08:18.323
I don't know.
Probably.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.587
But he didn't have an accent
or anything.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.066
- He say anything
about a bomb?

08:22.110 --> 08:24.852
- What? No. Why would he say
anything about a bomb?

08:24.895 --> 08:27.202
- 'Cause the car that you stole
blew up last night.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.857
- The black Chrysler was the--
Aw, man.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.815
I had no idea, I swear.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.164
- Let's go, turn around.
Hands behind your back.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.123
-
- You know the drill.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.040
- The Salem story checks out.
He doesn't appear to have ties

08:39.083 --> 08:40.737
with any
known terrorist groups.

08:40.781 --> 08:43.087
Just a local kid looking
to make some quick money.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.437
- Do we have video of him
talking to the suspect?

08:45.481 --> 08:47.004
- Uh, no, not yet.

08:47.048 --> 08:47.918
- Where did this meeting
take place?

08:47.962 --> 08:49.224
What part of Queens?

08:49.267 --> 08:51.574
- Astoria,
right near 28th and Steinway.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.620
Salem said
he had just had lunch

08:53.663 --> 08:56.144
at a restaurant
called Tannourine.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.450
- I know it.
Syrian restaurant.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.974
A guy named Hassan Ali
owns it.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.584
We've been monitoring him
for a few years.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.284
- Yeah, so 5'11",
thin, dark hair.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.809
Matches the general description
Salem gave.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.071
- I mean,
it's not much to go on.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.638
- Yeah, but it's something.

09:11.681 --> 09:12.900
We've got a CI
in the neighborhood.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.729
I'll get on that right away.
- Great.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.906
- No, sorry. I don't know
anything about that.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.038
I haven't heard anybody
talking about it either.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.388
- Do you know Hassan Ali?
- No.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.608
- Got a restaurant
at Steinway and 28th

09:25.652 --> 09:28.306
called Tannourine.
- So?

09:28.350 --> 09:31.614
- We think he might've been
involved in the recent bombing.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.747
- Which means we need you
to start hanging out there.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.705
All right, start talking
to people, taking photos.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.840
- You need to speak
to my attorney first.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.885
- Excuse me?

09:41.929 --> 09:43.626
- Look, I'm tired of the way
you guys are treating me.

09:43.670 --> 09:44.975
All right, every time I--

09:45.019 --> 09:47.151
- What the hell
are you talking about?

09:47.195 --> 09:50.459
- Look, from now on,
if you want to talk to me,

09:50.502 --> 09:52.679
speak with my attorney first.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.296
- This guy for real?

10:03.907 --> 10:07.389
"Mona Nazari."
Anybody know her?

10:10.261 --> 10:13.395
- Yeah.
That's...my girlfriend.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.233
- She left the U.S. Attorney's
Office two months ago

10:25.276 --> 10:26.669
and opened up
her own legal clinic,

10:26.713 --> 10:28.540
so it is possible
she's representing him.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.934
- That's great, but I just
don't know what the hell

10:30.978 --> 10:32.327
she's trying to do for Vega.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.416
We made a deal with him
two years ago

10:34.459 --> 10:36.374
after he got busted
for armed robbery.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.680
On top of that,

10:37.724 --> 10:39.726
he was undocumented,
facing deportation.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.076
NYPD reached out,
thought he may be interested,

10:42.119 --> 10:43.338
so we made an arrangement.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.035
- Okay, has he delivered
any valuable intel?

10:45.079 --> 10:47.168
- Some, but nothing
that's led to any arrests,

10:47.211 --> 10:48.691
so he owes us.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.388
He doesn't get
to just walk away

10:50.432 --> 10:51.868
now that we really need him.

10:51.912 --> 10:55.698
Look, what I'm saying is,
girlfriend or no girlfriend,

10:55.742 --> 10:57.744
if Vega doesn't live up
to end of the bargain,

10:57.787 --> 10:59.920
he'll be back on a plane
to Damascus real soon.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.316
-
All right.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.971
- I can't believe you guys are
still trying to pressure Vega.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.364
- Why do you say that?

11:09.407 --> 11:11.496
He's undocumented,
got pinched for armed robbery.

11:11.540 --> 11:14.325
- He stole $30 worth of food
from 7-Eleven

11:14.369 --> 11:16.197
and had a small knife
in his pocket.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.589
If he were white,

11:17.633 --> 11:19.983
he would've gotten
a gentle slap on the wrist.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.594
But he's Muslim from Syria.
Means he's valuable.

11:22.638 --> 11:25.032
So you guys leveraged him.

11:26.033 --> 11:29.514
"Spy on your friends, and we'll
let you stay in America."

11:29.558 --> 11:32.561
- Maybe, but that's
kind of irrelevant now.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.650
He either cooperates,
or he's gonna get deported.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.043
- It's not that simple.

11:36.086 --> 11:39.263
- It is that simple.
Three people just died.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.917
- That's not Vega's problem.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.616
- Mona, I don't want
to fight about this.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.401
Okay? I'm just trying
to do my job.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.055
- Your job.

11:48.098 --> 11:51.101
Being a loyal Fed no matter
what the circumstances.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.668
<i>♪</i>

11:54.539 --> 11:56.324
That's not fair.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.289
- Look, I think there's
a middle ground here.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.335
- What are you talking about?

12:07.378 --> 12:10.381
- If you guys agree to make
Vega a permanent legal resident

12:10.425 --> 12:13.341
after this operation's over,
he'll cooperate.

12:14.168 --> 12:17.780
If not, he's not stepping foot
near that restaurant.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.874
- You sure he would agree
to something like that?

12:24.918 --> 12:26.789
- Talked to him
ten minutes ago.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.052
Told him he should take
advantage of this opportunity.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.794
Try exploiting the people
exploiting him.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.626
You're good.

12:37.669 --> 12:40.020
- I'm just trying to do
what's best for my client.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.806
- Coffee for you?
- Thank you, Connor.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.594
- Hassan was seen talking

12:49.638 --> 12:51.074
to a few suspicious
foreign nationals

12:51.118 --> 12:52.554
about a month ago.

12:52.597 --> 12:55.383
One of the men's cousins
is a known terrorist in Syria.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.517
Yeah, I get it.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.519
I know, it's not a lot,
but it's all we got.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.350
I assume you've spoken
to his lawyer

13:06.394 --> 13:07.830
and resolved all this?
- I did.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.266
She said he is willing
to cooperate

13:09.310 --> 13:12.095
as long we can help secure
permanent legal residence

13:12.139 --> 13:13.705
when this is over.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.272
- He wants to renegotiate
the deal?

13:15.316 --> 13:16.665
Are you kidding me?

13:16.708 --> 13:18.754
- Well, that's what
his lawyer said,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.887
so with all due respect,
it kind of is what it is.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.847
- I think we should go for it.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.894
We need all the help
we can get.

13:27.937 --> 13:28.982
- Okay.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.162
Hassan Ali
is our ultimate target.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.555
He owns the restaurant, and he
spends a lot of time there too.

13:37.599 --> 13:38.861
- Do you have any evidence

13:38.905 --> 13:40.254
that he's actually involved
in any of this,

13:40.297 --> 13:41.516
or are you just speculating?

13:41.559 --> 13:42.734
- We never said that Hassan
was guilty.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.388
We just said that
he might be involved.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.129
- Based on what?

13:46.173 --> 13:48.044
- Based on our intelligence.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.046
- Do you have anything
more specific than that?

13:50.090 --> 13:51.482
- The day of the bombing,

13:51.526 --> 13:53.833
someone who fits the general
description of Hassan

13:53.876 --> 13:56.400
offered a guy 1,000 bucks
to steal a black Chrysler

13:56.444 --> 13:57.880
that was used in the bombing.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.187
- And that happened
a half block away

14:00.230 --> 14:01.579
from his restaurant,

14:01.623 --> 14:03.668
so we're not just picking names
out of a hat.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.192
- That street gets
a lot of foot traffic.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.324
All right, it's probably
just a coincidence.

14:07.368 --> 14:10.066
- Well, for now, let's pretend
it's not a coincidence, okay?

14:10.110 --> 14:12.416
All we can do
is find information

14:12.460 --> 14:13.940
and chase potential leads.

14:13.983 --> 14:17.465
- Okay, okay, I get it.
I'll do my part one last time.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.344
- This is Hassan Ali.

14:27.388 --> 14:28.519
These are the other people

14:28.563 --> 14:29.956
that we think
might be involved.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.566
- Wait, wait, I know that guy.
His name is Joseph.

14:31.609 --> 14:32.872
- Mm-hmm.
- That's good.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.264
He works at the restaurant.
He's a waiter.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.613
- Yeah, but he's
not a terrorist.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.094
He's like the nicest guy
I ever met.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.443
- Okay, look.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.923
You are going to
go to the restaurant,

14:40.967 --> 14:43.186
you're gonna find Joseph,
you're gonna start talking.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.275
If things go well, you're gonna
bring up the bombing.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.451
We'll take it from there.
- If you have an opportunity,

14:47.495 --> 14:48.800
I want you to get access
to the back room.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.193
Once you get in there,

14:50.237 --> 14:51.455
I want you to take pictures
of everything, okay?

14:51.499 --> 14:53.675
Photos, letters,
packages, bills.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.111
Whatever you can.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.634
- Look, Vega,
I know this is hard, but--

14:56.678 --> 14:59.768
- Hard?
No, this isn't hard.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.683
This is cruel.
This is evil.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.817
You're asking me to spy on
my friends and my neighbors.

15:05.861 --> 15:09.299
Why?
Because I'm Muslim.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.736
- No.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.522
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.584
- We've got eyes on Vega.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.980
- Assalamu alaikum
- What's going on?

15:38.024 --> 15:39.547
- Good to see you.
- You too.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.070
- Good, good.
- How's this?

15:41.114 --> 15:42.854
<i>- Perfect.
Thank you, brother.</i>

15:42.898 --> 15:44.900
<i>- I just saw your Uncle Raph
the other day.</i>

15:44.944 --> 15:47.337
<i>He's looking good.
- Uh, yeah, yeah...</i>

15:47.381 --> 15:49.122
- You doing okay with all this?

15:50.340 --> 15:51.689
- What do you mean?

15:51.733 --> 15:53.909
- You know what I mean.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.825
<i>- Hey, I'll be right back.</i>

15:56.868 --> 15:58.609
- Yeah.
I'm fine.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.568
I just, uh...

16:01.961 --> 16:03.875
I just separate
my two identities.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.226
You know, when I'm at work,
I'm a Fed.

16:06.269 --> 16:07.879
When I go home,

16:07.923 --> 16:10.970
I'm the Egyptian kid
from Queens.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.799
- That must be difficult
to compartmentalize like that.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.238
- No, not for me.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.809
<i>- You ready to order?
You hungry, man?</i>

16:24.853 --> 16:26.637
<i>- Oh, I'm starving.
- All right.</i>

16:26.681 --> 16:28.248
<i>I'm gonna get
the mezza platter,</i>

16:28.291 --> 16:29.858
<i>some fool,
and chicken shawarma.</i>

16:29.901 --> 16:31.207
<i>- All right, you got it.</i>

16:31.251 --> 16:32.861
- Joseph.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.777
- Hassan.
Do you know Vega Assad?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.257
- No, we never met.

16:38.954 --> 16:41.174
- Big fish is here.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.089
- Assalamu alaikum.
- Assalamu alaikum.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.916
<i>- I think it was on--
what was it, 37th Street?</i>

16:44.960 --> 16:47.049
<i>- Yes.
- He's an electrician.</i>

16:47.093 --> 16:49.443
<i>- You work for Ray Haddad?</i>

16:49.486 --> 16:51.401
I went to high school
with him.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.664
- No way.

16:53.708 --> 16:54.796
- How's he doing?

16:54.839 --> 16:56.406
- He's doing great.
Thank you.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.973
- That was quick.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.280
- Now he just needs to
reel him in nice and slow.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.978
- Yeah, no, work,
it's going really strong.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.067
I mean, the only thing
that could ruin it,

17:05.111 --> 17:06.982
of course, I suppose
would be the police.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.246
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

17:10.290 --> 17:12.596
<i>- Oh, well,
you know how they are.</i>

17:12.640 --> 17:14.163
Always looking
to cause problems.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.078
Especially when a bomb goes off.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.732
<i>You know, the minute
something explodes,</i>

17:17.775 --> 17:19.342
<i>anything, firecrackers,</i>

17:19.386 --> 17:21.562
we get harassed.

17:21.605 --> 17:22.998
- I get it, trust me.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.306
My restaurant is under
surveillance all the time.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.092
The Feds have this crazy idea

17:30.136 --> 17:32.747
that I'm involved
with some terror group.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.315
- Of course they do
because you're a Muslim.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.143
- You get paranoid for real.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.841
<i>I mean, I got so anxious,
I installed a security system.</i>

17:39.884 --> 17:42.148
<i>It cost me $4,000.</i>

17:43.366 --> 17:45.586
- That could be useful info.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.414
- I don't blame you.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.807
- At least now I got eyes
all over the place.

17:49.851 --> 17:51.287
Comes in handy too.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.811
The other day I saw
an older woman fall on the ice.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.726
I was able to help her.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.164
Small world too.
I know her sister, Yvonne.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.209
- Are you kidding me?
-

18:00.253 --> 18:02.211
- You know Yvonne
and the other lady, Valerie...

18:02.255 --> 18:04.126
- Yeah?
- Those are my cousins.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.780
Yeah, we live in
the same building.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.738
- That's what I love
about this neighborhood.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.654
-
- We're all connected.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.961
- Yeah.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.311
- Very nice to meet you, Vega,
but I need to go.

18:15.355 --> 18:18.140
- Yeah, no, please.
No problem.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.621
- No check for him.
He is my friend.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.840
- Thank you.

- Hey, Joseph, hey.
My mother just texted me, man.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.924
I gotta go give her
a ride somewhere, okay?

19:02.967 --> 19:04.534
I gotta cancel the order.
I'm sorry.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.101
- No problem.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.929
- Assalamu alaikum.
- Alaikum assalamu.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.281
- What the hell was that?
What's he doing?

19:14.892 --> 19:17.068
- Hey, Vega.
Hey!

19:17.112 --> 19:19.245
What the hell was that,
man?

19:19.288 --> 19:21.160
Hey!
What the hell was that?

19:21.203 --> 19:22.552
The place
was practically empty.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.250
It was the perfect time
to take some pictures--

19:24.293 --> 19:25.251
- I can't do it!

19:25.294 --> 19:26.904
I'm sorry, all right?
I tried.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.384
I really tried.
I can't do it.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.909
These are good people.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.042
- Not if
they're planting bombs.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.087
- But you don't even know
if they are.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.873
You're just speculating.
You're guessing!

19:38.916 --> 19:40.396
- That's part of the process,
Vega.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.833
We're investigating.
We're looking for evidence.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.879
If we don't find any,
then we move on.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.794
There's nothing to worry about.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.797
- So tomorrow you are gonna
go back there

19:49.840 --> 19:51.015
and you're gonna take advantage
of your relationships,

19:51.059 --> 19:53.235
you understand me?
- I just told you.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.151
I'm not doing it, all right?
This.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.242
I'd rather be deported,
for real.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.288
All the spying you guys
are having me do, I...

20:04.420 --> 20:07.945
I actually thought
about killing myself today.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.253
I mean it.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.995
I thought might be the best way
out of this nightmare.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.480
I don't wanna die,

20:20.523 --> 20:24.397
but I don't want
to be a traitor either.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.967
The FBI stole my soul.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.448
So please...

20:32.492 --> 20:34.755
just leave me alone.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.887
Leave me alone.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.370
- Vega, you don't
wanna do that.

20:41.414 --> 20:44.547
- Aw, go to hell.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.606
- We need some good news.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.651
Tell us Vega's
making some progress.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.131
- Well--
- Yeah, I think he is.

21:03.174 --> 21:04.480
He met with Hassan last night,

21:04.524 --> 21:06.177
turns out they have some close
friends in common,

21:06.221 --> 21:08.267
so there's a high level
of trust right off the bat.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.094
- Great, did you manage
to get any photos,

21:10.138 --> 21:11.313
gather any actionable intel?

21:11.357 --> 21:13.663
- No, unfortunately
the opportunity

21:13.707 --> 21:16.318
didn't present itself.
- But we are very confident

21:16.362 --> 21:18.407
that he's gonna be
a valuable asset.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.540
- Okay, great, stay on him.
See what you can learn.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.106
- Okay.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.027
- OA...

21:30.071 --> 21:32.639
- Thank you.
Thank you for having my back.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.031
- I'm getting uncomfortable

21:34.075 --> 21:35.511
with this line
that you're walking.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.905
- Maggie, I'm fine.
Everything is under control.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.863
- Really?
Because the last I checked,

21:39.907 --> 21:41.604
our informant told us
to go to hell.

21:41.648 --> 21:44.085
- He did, but I'm going to talk
to Mona right now.

21:44.128 --> 21:46.392
I'm gonna get this whole thing
back on track.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.045
- Okay, OA,

21:48.089 --> 21:49.830
just listen.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.659
I know that this situation's
got to be complicated for you,

21:52.702 --> 21:54.922
so if you want me to take
point, I'm happy to do that

21:54.965 --> 21:57.228
just take some pressure off.

21:57.272 --> 22:00.057
- Thank you, okay?
I got this.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.670
I promise, all right?
I'll call you.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.631
- He's out, Omar.
- We had a deal.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.894
We offered to make him
a permanent legal resident.

22:10.938 --> 22:11.939
- He'd doesn't care.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.071
He'd rather roll the dice
in court.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.508
-
Oh, I get that,

22:15.551 --> 22:17.510
but you know there's no chance
you can win, right?

22:17.553 --> 22:18.772
He's gonna get deported.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.164
I don't care how good
of a lawyer you are.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.340
You do not stand a chance

22:21.383 --> 22:22.602
if Rina Trenholm
is gunning for you.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.255
- Maybe, but I'm still
gonna try my best

22:24.299 --> 22:25.779
to do everything I can
to protect him.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.085
- And I get that as well,

22:28.129 --> 22:30.697
but a bomb just went off
three miles from here

22:30.740 --> 22:32.960
yesterday morning,
and three people were killed.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.963
- That's not Vega's fault.
None of this is Vega's fault!

22:36.006 --> 22:37.617
You guys like to pretend
like it is!

22:37.660 --> 22:39.401
You cut him some terrible deal
two years ago,

22:39.445 --> 22:41.055
and you think you own him.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.970
- Okay, you need to slow down
because you keep saying "you."

22:43.013 --> 22:46.277
I did not make that deal.
This is not on me!

22:47.627 --> 22:50.369
- You sure about that?

22:51.021 --> 22:52.414
- What the hell
are you talking about?

22:52.458 --> 22:54.373
You don't see me doing
everything I can

22:54.416 --> 22:55.765
so this guy
does not get deported?

22:55.809 --> 22:58.115
- Yeah, by forcing him
to sell out his integrity

22:58.159 --> 22:59.595
and risk his life?

22:59.639 --> 23:02.555
You don't get to be the good
guy here, Omar, I'm sorry.

23:02.598 --> 23:05.732
You just don't.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.086
What is it?
- Another bomb just went off.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.789
- Target was a branch
at Freedom Regional

23:19.833 --> 23:21.051
on 36th Avenue.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.444
- Techs confirmed
it was a pipe bomb,

23:22.488 --> 23:25.273
mostly nails and glass.
Two injured, no deaths.

23:25.316 --> 23:27.449
- Three witnesses saw a man
in a hoodie, dark hair,

23:27.493 --> 23:29.451
possibly Middle Eastern hanging
out in the lobby of the bank

23:29.495 --> 23:31.540
for few minutes,
drop something, then head out.

23:31.584 --> 23:32.976
A minute later
was the explosion.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.239
- Okay, any indication
it's tied to other bombing?

23:35.283 --> 23:36.458
- Nothing yet.

23:36.502 --> 23:37.459
- But we've got agents
pulling video.

23:37.503 --> 23:38.808
Inside, outside,
everywhere we can.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.158
- Yeah. Okay, so folks,
what's going on here?

23:41.202 --> 23:42.464
We got a new
and different bomb.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.466
It's less sophisticated.
What does that mean?

23:44.510 --> 23:46.076
Same group, different device?

23:46.120 --> 23:48.035
They ran out
of high quality explosives,

23:48.078 --> 23:49.471
didn't wanna steal
another car,

23:49.515 --> 23:51.168
or they're running low
on funds and supplies

23:51.212 --> 23:53.127
and getting desperate, or...

23:53.170 --> 23:55.129
there's another bomber
out there.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.044
So let's find a connection,
yeah?

23:57.087 --> 23:58.349
- I have video
of the explosion.

23:58.393 --> 23:59.960
- Okay, yes, okay.
Throw it up.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.223
Eyes up.

24:15.715 --> 24:18.413
All right,
good news is nobody died.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.763
We caught a break on this one.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.765
But let's not plan
on getting lucky again.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.332
Let's dig in.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.942
All right, Ian, let's pull
the video from the pole cam

24:25.986 --> 24:27.683
we installed outside Hassan's
restaurant this morning.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.511
- Okay, Hassan
left the restaurant

24:29.555 --> 24:31.426
47 minutes before
the pipe bomb detonated

24:31.470 --> 24:34.734
and then he returned
68 minutes later.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.738
- Where's the bomb video?
Put it back up.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.523
Elise, can you put
Hassan's photo up?

24:41.567 --> 24:42.568
Thank you.

24:44.961 --> 24:48.878
I don't know.
I mean, that could be Hassan.

24:48.922 --> 24:51.446
I don't know, can you
throw his associates up

24:51.490 --> 24:53.535
and run facial comparison?

24:58.584 --> 25:00.368
Can't we get a better visual?
- No.

25:00.411 --> 25:01.978
Video's low res,
but we're on it.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.111
We're chasing every cam
within a mile from the bank.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.287
- Well, you know,
I like your pluck, Kelly,

25:06.330 --> 25:07.723
but we need more than pluck.
We need results.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.246
So keep digging.

25:09.290 --> 25:12.075
Elise, let's find a nexus
between these two bomb sites.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.948
What do they have in common?
Who do they have in common?

25:14.991 --> 25:15.992
Thank you.
Hey.

25:16.036 --> 25:18.473
- Hey.
- We're all over it.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.780
I can't definitively connect
the image to Hassan

25:20.823 --> 25:22.433
or any of his associates.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.566
- All right.
Can't rule him out either.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.221
- Right.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.878
- We tried to put Vega
back into play, but--

25:31.921 --> 25:34.489
- But he thought that Hassan
might have made him.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.797
But the good news is
that he got Hassan talking,

25:37.840 --> 25:39.929
and we were able
to identify an opportunity.

25:39.973 --> 25:43.367
- What are you talking about?
- Well, Hassan said that he has

25:43.411 --> 25:45.021
a very sophisticated
surveillance system

25:45.065 --> 25:47.720
at his restaurant, lots of
cameras pointing outwards,

25:47.763 --> 25:49.373
so maybe one of those cameras
caught the conversation

25:49.417 --> 25:53.334
between Salem and whoever gave
him $1,000 to steal that car.

25:55.336 --> 25:57.468
- I'm not sure we have enough
for a warrant.

25:57.512 --> 25:59.949
- No, but could be enough

25:59.993 --> 26:02.125
for a sneak and peek.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.779
- It's risky,

26:03.823 --> 26:06.913
but it might make more sense
to use Vega.

26:06.956 --> 26:10.481
- Yes, I agree,
but he's too anxious.

26:10.525 --> 26:13.441
We don't think
he can pull this one off.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.751
- Okay.
All right, go for it.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.759
- What are you thinking?

26:26.802 --> 26:28.412
- I'm trying to find evidence,
Maggie,

26:28.456 --> 26:30.327
and the only lead we have
is Hassan's security system.

26:30.371 --> 26:31.981
- I agree with that, but--

26:32.025 --> 26:33.504
- And the only reason that we
have Hassan's security system

26:33.548 --> 26:35.071
is because of Vega.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.638
- You are trying to protect
Vega from getting deported.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.032
- No, no, Maggie, you're wrong.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.642
I am just trying to do my job

26:40.686 --> 26:41.687
and chase
what's in front of me,

26:41.730 --> 26:42.862
and I keep trying to tell you--

26:42.905 --> 26:44.515
- I know what
you're trying to tell me.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.126
You're trying to say
that you're really good

26:46.169 --> 26:47.606
at separating
your personal life

26:47.649 --> 26:49.782
from your professional life.

26:49.825 --> 26:50.913
But what I'm telling you

26:50.957 --> 26:53.699
is that
you're not very good at it.

26:54.656 --> 26:57.528
You are bending over backwards
to try to help Vega

26:57.572 --> 26:59.008
because you think
he got screwed.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.793
- No.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.143
- Stop denying it,

27:03.186 --> 27:06.799
and stop pretending that
you're just doing your job.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.075
- Okay.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.947
Let's get to work.
We got some video to steal.

27:36.263 --> 27:37.786
- What's up?

27:37.830 --> 27:40.223
- Hassan just closed up two
minutes ago, lights are off.

27:40.267 --> 27:41.572
- Ian ready?

27:41.616 --> 27:42.704
- Yeah,
he's in a covert vehicle

27:42.748 --> 27:44.097
on the south side
of the street.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.360
On our order, he's gonna cut
the electrical feed.

27:46.403 --> 27:49.537
- Okay, let's go.
Give Ian the signal.

27:58.764 --> 28:04.421
<i>♪</i>

28:23.789 --> 28:25.007
OA, it's in here.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.640
<i>All right,
we're copying files,</i>

28:49.684 --> 28:51.468
<i>but we need a minute.
Maybe two.</i>

28:53.775 --> 28:55.342
- Heads up.
Heads up.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.387
Hassan is here.
I repeat, Hassan is here.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.041
He's walking toward
the front door.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.478
<i>- You gotta buy us
some more time.</i>

29:06.179 --> 29:07.789
- Oh, my goodness.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.487
Thank God you're open!
I'm starving.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.315
- I'm sorry, miss.
We're closed.

29:12.359 --> 29:13.752
I just forgot my phone.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.667
- Oh, come on, man.
Look.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.408
I got two gummies
kicking in right now.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.497
I can't tell you
how bad I need

29:20.541 --> 29:22.151
some of them chicken kabobs!

29:22.195 --> 29:23.544
Some of that hummus!

29:30.290 --> 29:32.379
<i>- We probably need
another 30 seconds or so.</i>

29:32.422 --> 29:34.511
- I'm, like, getting on two...

29:36.339 --> 29:38.254
- Okay, okay.

29:38.298 --> 29:39.952
We're good.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.521
- Oh, I get it.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.915
Okay, I get it.
Naw, I see.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.309
I might have to write up
a report on social media

29:49.352 --> 29:51.006
and let everybody know
how you treat Black folks.

29:51.050 --> 29:54.575
- I'm closed.
Has nothing to do with that.

29:54.618 --> 29:57.534
Trust me, miss,
I know all about racism.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.101
I'll tell you what.

29:59.145 --> 30:02.888
Come back tomorrow, lunch,
dinner, doesn't matter--on me.

30:04.498 --> 30:05.847
- Okay, we're good.
We're heading out.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.588
You can turn
the electricity back on.

30:07.631 --> 30:09.546
Go, go, go, go.

30:10.243 --> 30:12.245
- Well, thank you.

30:12.288 --> 30:15.596
That's very nice of you.
Thank you, I appreciate you.

30:19.165 --> 30:20.383
See you tomorrow!

30:20.427 --> 30:22.472
- Yep. Kay.

30:40.926 --> 30:44.190
<i>- We made it out.
We got the security footage.</i>

30:44.233 --> 30:45.452
- All right, let's blow it up.

30:45.495 --> 30:47.933
- Running facial rec now...

30:47.976 --> 30:49.325
Got it.

30:49.369 --> 30:52.241
Philip Stafford, 37,
owner of Formex Fitness LLC,

30:52.285 --> 30:53.764
resides in Westchester.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.158
- Okay, does Stafford connect
in any way to Hassan Ali?

30:56.202 --> 30:59.031
- I'm not seeing anything.
- Yeah, me neither.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.729
- What else can you tell me
about Stafford?

31:01.772 --> 31:03.557
- His LLC filed for bankruptcy
three weeks ago.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.124
- Okay.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.039
- One of the creditors, his
landlord, was Hedler Realty.

31:07.082 --> 31:08.605
The President of which
is Mark Heller,

31:08.649 --> 31:09.911
one of the victims
from the first bombing.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.608
- Another creditor
was Freedom Regional Bank.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.480
- Okay, people, time to pivot!

31:13.523 --> 31:16.657
Philip Stafford.

31:17.788 --> 31:20.661
Let's get an address
and scoop him up.

31:20.704 --> 31:23.664
I'll send it your way.
- I didn't see that coming.

31:23.707 --> 31:24.926
- That Vega was right?

31:24.970 --> 31:27.929
Hassan didn't do it,
we just profiled him?

31:32.891 --> 31:35.023
- On me.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.592
Go!

31:45.381 --> 31:47.514
- FBI, don't move!
-

31:47.557 --> 31:49.168
- Where's Philip?
- He's not here.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.996
He hasn't lived here
for three months.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.954
We're getting a divorce. Why?
What the hell is happening?

31:52.998 --> 31:55.130
- We think he may be involved
in two recent bombings.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.871
- Bombings?
What are you talking about--

31:56.915 --> 31:57.959
- Ma'am, do you know
where he is?

31:58.003 --> 31:59.613
We need to talk to him
right now.

31:59.656 --> 32:00.962
- No, he's been struggling.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.269
He's been staying
with friends, cousins.

32:03.312 --> 32:06.837
- What's his mental state like?
- Uh, not good.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.665
He's angry and erratic.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.145
I won't even let him
see the kids.

32:10.189 --> 32:13.844
He's--he's so full of hate
right now.

32:13.888 --> 32:17.283
He's spiraling.
He's desperate and broke.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.547
He asked me for a loan
the other day.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.984
$20,000.
I said no.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.943
- Well, you just changed
your mind.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.509
You're gonna call him up
right now,

32:26.553 --> 32:27.728
tell him that
you feel terrible,

32:27.771 --> 32:29.164
and that he can
borrow the money.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.513
- But he's gotta
pick the check up here.

32:30.557 --> 32:32.472
At the house.
Now.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.958
- Hi, Philip.
It's me.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.003
No, no, no, no.
The kids are fine.

32:42.047 --> 32:45.311
I was just--I was, um,
thinking about things

32:45.354 --> 32:46.921
and, uh,

32:46.965 --> 32:49.228
well, if you still want me
to lend you the money, I can.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.060
So why don't you
swing by the house,

32:55.103 --> 32:58.106
say hi to the kids,
and I can give you the check.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.719
Okay, good.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.072
He'll be here in 30 minutes.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.216
- We'll call you
when we know more.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.354
- Suspect will be driving
a gray Infiniti,

33:28.397 --> 33:32.053
New York tags,
Oscar, Peter, Allen, 4265.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.273
- Can you confirm the wife
and kids are off the premises?

33:34.316 --> 33:36.797
- Yeah, confirmed.
Just left headed north.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.369
- Got eyes on a gray Infiniti.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.154
- Okay, let him walk
to the front door.

33:46.198 --> 33:47.112
We'll take him here.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.387
- That's not Stafford.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.215
- What the hell?

34:12.833 --> 34:14.704
- FBI!
Don't move!

34:14.748 --> 34:17.272
- Whoa, whoa!
Whoa, don't shoot.

34:17.316 --> 34:19.840
- Don't move.
Stay where you are.

34:19.883 --> 34:22.451
Who are you?
- Jason Cassidy.

34:22.495 --> 34:25.280
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.369
- What the hell are you talking
about "you don't know"?

34:27.413 --> 34:30.024
- I was walking by 29th Street,
and this guy was acting crazy.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.026
Said he'd give me his Rolex
and Infiniti

34:32.070 --> 34:34.811
if I delivered this letter
to his wife, and I did.

34:34.855 --> 34:37.031
I mean, what was I supposed
to do, say no?

34:47.346 --> 34:50.131
- He saw Stafford outside of
Damaso's Market in Greenpoint.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.002
He was standing outside
of his Infiniti smoking.

34:52.046 --> 34:53.613
- Had the letter in his hand,
too,

34:53.656 --> 34:56.137
like he was just waiting
for the right dude to walk by.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.748
- He's escalating, giving away
his valuable assets like that.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.620
- Yeah, he's spinning out
all right.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.143
Knows his wife
tried to set him up.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.710
Talks about
all the shame, guilt,

35:03.753 --> 35:06.887
how he worked 24 hours a day
to succeed but no one cared.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.889
- Any indication
who his next target might be?

35:08.932 --> 35:12.327
- Uh, yeah, his "rich bitch"
sister-in-law, Ashley.

35:12.371 --> 35:14.808
"She poisoned our marriage.
She said you deserved better.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.897
"More.
That's why I tried to expand.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.029
That's why I went bankrupt,
because of her."

35:19.073 --> 35:21.075
- Okay.
Hey, Jubal, it's OA.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.164
We need help locating the
sister-in-law of our suspect.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.557
We believe
she's his next target.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.298
- Guys, check it out.
This is Ashley Dorsey,

35:26.341 --> 35:28.604
Philip Stafford's
sister-in-law non grata.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.345
We need to find her fast.
Let's go.

35:30.389 --> 35:32.956
- Okay, she is
a Managing Director

35:33.000 --> 35:35.524
at Crestford Capital.
355 Park Avenue.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.526
According to her sister,
she's there right now.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.094
Okay, Elise, give her a call,
tell her what's going on.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.835
Tell her we have agents
on the way to her now.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.489
Get some agents over there,

35:43.532 --> 35:45.491
and let's find Stafford now!

35:45.534 --> 35:46.666
Credit cards, traffic cams.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.189
- Metro card.
- Exactly.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.931
- No, I mean I just got a hit
on his actual metro card.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.541
He got on the N train
at Ditmars Avenue

35:52.585 --> 35:54.064
in Astoria 17 minutes ago.

35:54.108 --> 35:55.892
- Okay, Kelly, what's
Ashley Dorsey's home address?

35:55.936 --> 35:57.067
I'm guessing
it's in Lower Manhattan.

35:57.111 --> 35:59.766
- Correct.
246 Church Street.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.777
- We got eyes on Stafford.
- We got him.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.610
- FBI, stop moving.
- Don't move.

36:20.482 --> 36:21.875
- Put your gun on the ground
using one hand.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.833
Other hand in the air.

36:23.877 --> 36:26.184
- I didn't wanna do
any of this!

36:28.447 --> 36:30.144
I swear.

36:31.537 --> 36:34.061
But the system is rigged!

36:35.280 --> 36:37.847
No one cares
about regular people.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.023
- Put the gun down.

36:45.986 --> 36:49.032
<i>- Are those his nephews?
- Hey.</i>

36:49.076 --> 36:51.426
They got nothing to do
with this, Philip.

36:51.470 --> 36:52.471
They're kids.

36:55.517 --> 36:56.953
Put the gun down.

37:07.050 --> 37:14.188
<i>♪</i>

37:23.371 --> 37:24.677
- Hey.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.332
Turns out those two kids
weren't even his nephews.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.944
Dude was just trying to go out
with a bang, huh?

37:32.598 --> 37:34.295
- Yeah, guy just snapped.

37:35.775 --> 37:37.342
Too much pressure I guess.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.477
- Hey, OA.
- Yeah?

37:42.521 --> 37:46.046
- Uh, I'm not trying
to get in your business,

37:46.089 --> 37:48.614
but I overheard you
talking to Maggie earlier.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.355
- Yeah.
Yeah, what's up?

37:51.704 --> 37:55.055
- This idea of trying
to keep things separate,

37:55.098 --> 37:58.319
you know, compartmentalize
your two identities,

37:58.363 --> 37:59.929
I get it.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.018
I used to do it.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.107
It don't work.

38:06.632 --> 38:09.635
You gotta own who you are.

38:09.678 --> 38:12.638
Who you really are.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.466
If that's enough for some of
these white folks

38:14.509 --> 38:15.945
around here
then to hell with them.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.255
- Yeah?

38:21.299 --> 38:22.648
- Yeah.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.347
Thank you, Tiff.
I appreciate it.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.653
- Yeah.

38:27.696 --> 38:30.090
- OA, we need to talk.

38:31.918 --> 38:34.529
- <i>
- We know what happened.</i>

38:34.573 --> 38:37.445
That Vega backed out
of the operation.

38:38.228 --> 38:39.360
- Yes, because
he was concerned--

38:39.404 --> 38:42.450
- Because he didn't wanna
help the FBI.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.803
- That may be true.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.283
But without him,

38:49.327 --> 38:51.067
we wouldn't have known
about the security footage,

38:51.111 --> 38:53.243
we wouldn't
have chased that lead,

38:53.287 --> 38:55.420
and we would not
have gotten Stafford.

39:01.164 --> 39:04.385
- OA, we know that this
is complicated for you

39:04.429 --> 39:05.647
for many reasons.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.085
You were trying to do your job

39:09.129 --> 39:12.567
while trying to protect Vega
at the same time.

39:18.443 --> 39:22.534
<i>♪</i>

39:22.577 --> 39:24.057
- You're right.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.841
I was.

39:25.885 --> 39:30.106
Because what we did to Vega
wasn't right, okay?

39:30.150 --> 39:31.586
We squeezed him too hard.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.633
We forced him to spy
on his friends, his family,

39:34.676 --> 39:36.417
religious leaders...

39:37.287 --> 39:38.419
And we didn't even know

39:38.463 --> 39:40.987
if they were
actually terrorists.

39:43.250 --> 39:46.296
We just assume they are

39:46.340 --> 39:48.429
or that they might be.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.605
Why?

39:50.649 --> 39:53.347
Because of their religion?
Because of their nationality?

39:56.002 --> 39:57.482
That's not okay.
Not anymore.

40:01.486 --> 40:04.445
- These guys don't wear masks,
Zidan,

40:04.489 --> 40:07.666
or have names on the back
of their shirts.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.451
They live insular communities
protected by friends,

40:10.495 --> 40:12.410
relatives, and sometimes
religious leaders.

40:12.453 --> 40:15.021
That's a fact.
- Yeah.

40:15.064 --> 40:17.197
- Yeah, that's why
we need informants.

40:22.115 --> 40:24.247
We've saved hundreds,

40:24.291 --> 40:26.598
maybe thousands of lives
doing it this way,

40:26.641 --> 40:29.514
so please, don't play the poor,
exploited Muslim card.

40:30.471 --> 40:31.777
Okay, 'cause this kid, Vega,

40:31.820 --> 40:34.170
he was on his way to Syria
until I intervened.

40:34.214 --> 40:35.607
Until I helped him out.

40:35.650 --> 40:38.871
I let him stay here
with his cousins and siblings.

40:38.914 --> 40:41.526
I even got him a job.

40:50.404 --> 40:54.016

what you have to do,

40:54.060 --> 40:57.193
so get it done.

41:21.174 --> 41:24.394
- Vega Assad,
you're under arrest.

41:24.438 --> 41:26.658
- Vega, I have your back.

41:26.701 --> 41:28.529
I'm gonna help you
get through all this.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.675
- There was nothing
that I could do.
