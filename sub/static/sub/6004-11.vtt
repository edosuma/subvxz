WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:04.770
No. That is not
right. It's not right!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.705
There are things in life
we do because we must, Quill.

00:07.707 --> 00:08.874
Not because we want to.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.743
Right, Rocket?

00:10.744 --> 00:13.612
Ho-ho! I don't know what daddy
Thanos taught you, Gamora,

00:13.613 --> 00:15.914
but there's a line
decent beings don't cross.

00:15.915 --> 00:17.516
You can't make us! It's...

00:17.517 --> 00:18.650
Ready!

00:21.554 --> 00:23.689
W'kerian slug-roach casserole.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.692
Ugh... The entrails have,
of course, been included.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.727
Now, who would like to break the crust?

00:28.728 --> 00:31.797
I am Groot.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.866
Groot's right. I mean, it...

00:33.867 --> 00:36.468
It's just too pretty to serve, Drax.

00:36.469 --> 00:40.606
We should probably just
enjoy it visually for a while.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.841
Perhaps.

00:42.842 --> 00:46.478
This dish was my wife's
greatest culinary work.

00:46.479 --> 00:47.880
She was truly a wonderful cook. Shh.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.784
And I will eviscerate anyone
who says otherwise.

00:51.785 --> 00:52.951
Eh, naturally.

00:54.687 --> 00:55.988
Huh?

00:55.989 --> 00:58.924
Yes! I mean, oh, no time to
eat. Under attack. Gotta run.

01:02.662 --> 01:03.896
I thought you said

01:03.897 --> 01:06.865
the CryptoCube's path took
us through empty space.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.739
Ha! Empty space is what's attacking us.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.908
Wait. How is empty space attacking us?

01:18.678 --> 01:19.745
Engines hit.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.846
We're losing power.

01:20.847 --> 01:21.880
On it.

01:24.784 --> 01:27.486
Quill, I think you're right.

01:27.487 --> 01:29.655
Empty space is attacking us.

01:29.656 --> 01:30.823
Thank you.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.724
What? Why do you think I'm right?

01:32.725 --> 01:34.726
Because those aren't meteors.

01:34.727 --> 01:37.696
They're ships... Crushed ships.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.800
Uh, what could crush a ship like that?

01:41.801 --> 01:43.869
The same thing that's crushing us.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074

02:04.674 --> 02:05.607
Hang on!

02:08.578 --> 02:11.280
Where'd your stupid
map lead us this time, Quill?

02:11.281 --> 02:13.348
Hey, I'm under
a lot of pressure here.

02:13.349 --> 02:15.284
So is our krutakin' ship!

02:17.587 --> 02:19.555
We're in a gravity storm.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.591
These areas of super-dense space
are Nebula's favorite traps.

02:22.592 --> 02:24.359
Her ships can move through safely.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.196
Her victims' ships weren't so lucky.

02:29.365 --> 02:31.233
We gotta get out of here.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.467
What do you think I...
Whoa!

02:32.468 --> 02:34.636
Aah!

02:34.637 --> 02:36.505
Rocket, squeeze yourself into the cockpit

02:36.506 --> 02:38.207
and fly us out of here.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.541
Drax, jettison the food.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.410
Why would that help?

02:41.411 --> 02:42.511
There's no time!

02:42.512 --> 02:45.314
Hang onto your hides!

02:49.619 --> 02:51.353
Yeah.

02:54.290 --> 02:56.525
That the best you've got, gravity storm?

03:00.630 --> 03:04.166
Eh, the phrase you're looking for is,

03:04.167 --> 03:06.468
"You're an awesome pilot, Rocket."

03:06.469 --> 03:09.371
You're a small pilot.
It's not the same thing.

03:09.372 --> 03:13.542
Now, let's see how big this
gravity storm actually is.

03:13.543 --> 03:17.346
The cosmic seed energy reading is
on the other side of that storm.

03:17.347 --> 03:18.647
It'll take months to get around it.

03:18.648 --> 03:20.349
Years.

03:20.350 --> 03:22.584
It'd be like circling
around 1.000 solar systems.

03:22.585 --> 03:25.187
You said Nebula could
get through the storms.

03:25.188 --> 03:26.421
We'll just use whatever she did.

03:26.422 --> 03:28.657
Is your entire species this stupid?

03:28.658 --> 03:31.460
You need a repulsar field
generator to do that.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.529
The only place you could
even maybe get one is...

03:34.530 --> 03:38.400
Knowhere. Finest hideout/severed
head in the galaxy.

03:44.407 --> 03:46.208
Hey, Cosmo, what's shaking?

03:46.209 --> 03:47.576
Besides your tail.

03:47.577 --> 03:51.613
Uh, is
good joke, as Cosmo is dog.

03:51.614 --> 03:53.348
But in serious,

03:53.349 --> 03:55.684
Cosmo knows Peter Quill,
who is also called Star-Lord,

03:55.685 --> 03:58.287
needs to get around gravity storm.

03:58.288 --> 04:02.324
But continuum cortex
teleportation system is still down.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.160
Stop reading minds, you mutt.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.195
Nobody likes a psychic snoop.

04:07.196 --> 04:12.167
And yet Cosmo thinks Vermin
will like this snooping.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.337
Is one person in Knowhere
with repulsar generator.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.471
Only problem...

04:16.471 --> 04:19.207
That one person would be me.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.442
The Collector! Hey!

04:21.444 --> 04:24.179
You're not still mad at us, right?

04:24.180 --> 04:25.480
Old buddy? Old pal?

04:26.316 --> 04:27.516
Huh?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.584
Because you broke our agreement,

04:29.585 --> 04:33.588
stole my property, or destroyed
one of my most priceless archives?

04:33.589 --> 04:37.192
Now, come... Hey, we've all
said, done, and blown up things

04:37.193 --> 04:38.360
we wish we hadn't,

04:38.361 --> 04:40.295
but that doesn't mean we can't do business.

04:40.296 --> 04:42.264
How much for the generator?

04:42.265 --> 04:43.665
It is not for sale.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.668
However...

04:46.669 --> 04:49.204
What reeks?

04:50.540 --> 04:53.542
There is one task I
have been loathe to undertake.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.344
If you did it for me,

04:55.345 --> 04:58.280
I could loan you my generator.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.482
You want us to transport statues?

05:00.483 --> 05:03.185
Not statues. Moombas.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.555
Huh?

05:09.559 --> 05:12.260
I am Groot. I am Groot!

05:12.261 --> 05:13.462
Don't eat my friends.

05:15.298 --> 05:18.500
Disgusting. Get back in the
cargo bay where you belong.

05:18.501 --> 05:21.603
Oh, gross, it got in my mouth. Ew.

05:21.604 --> 05:23.505
Little help, Drax.

05:23.506 --> 05:24.573
Drax?

05:24.574 --> 05:27.309
Why did it have to be moombas?

05:27.310 --> 05:29.244
Thanks for nothing, Drax.

05:29.245 --> 05:32.447
What, big, bad destroyer
scared of livestock?

05:32.448 --> 05:34.516
I am not scared.

05:34.517 --> 05:37.586
I am appropriately cautious
around dangerous beasts.

05:38.554 --> 05:39.654
As a young warrior,

05:39.655 --> 05:42.257
I was attacked by a moomba herd.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.359
They came out of nowhere.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.395
And it is my intention

05:46.396 --> 05:49.331
to remove them from Knowhere.

05:49.332 --> 05:52.200
They are a present for my brother.

05:52.201 --> 05:55.270
I need them brought to
Conjunction in two days.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.205
Conjunction?

05:57.206 --> 06:01.143
We ain't exactly welcome back on
that neon-lit gaming planetoid.

06:01.144 --> 06:05.280
But if it means getting a repulsar
generator, we will gladly do it.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.517
It is such a garish
little world. Is it not?

06:08.518 --> 06:12.320
But with a name like the Grandmaster,

06:12.321 --> 06:15.557
my brother is a little garish himself.

06:15.558 --> 06:18.627
Your brother is the Grandmaster?

06:19.629 --> 06:22.230
Ridiculous title, I know,

06:22.231 --> 06:24.199
but family is family.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.302
Just drop the moombas in
front of that statue of his,

06:27.303 --> 06:30.272
and I will take care of the rest.

06:30.273 --> 06:35.577
Oh, and do not feed the
moombas anything but grass.

06:35.578 --> 06:37.412
Things can get a bit...

06:37.413 --> 06:38.613
Messy.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.651
Messy?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.419
<i>Great job, Quill.</i>

06:44.420 --> 06:46.555
<i>You just signed us up for
the smelliest, grossest,</i>

06:46.556 --> 06:49.324
<i>most boring job in the galaxy,</i>

06:49.325 --> 06:52.427
<i>and all so one guy
who tried to kill us</i>

06:52.428 --> 06:55.630
<i>can get a present from his
brother, who also tried to kill us.</i>

06:55.631 --> 06:58.400
Yeah, but the Collector
threw in this cowboy hat,

06:58.401 --> 07:00.268
so yee-ha!

07:00.269 --> 07:02.571
That hat resembles
neither a cow nor a boy.

07:02.572 --> 07:05.173
And repeating that phrase
does not change the fact that

07:05.174 --> 07:06.374
moombas cannot be trusted.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.276
<i>I am Groot. I am Groot!</i>

07:08.277 --> 07:11.179
Whoa, guys, get down here.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.547
<i>Now!</i>

07:12.548 --> 07:14.583
Actually, we have a bigger problem.

07:16.452 --> 07:19.187
<i>Okay, Quill, pull it over.</i>

07:19.188 --> 07:21.289
Relax. It's just Nova Corps.

07:21.290 --> 07:22.557
We're not doing anything illegal.

07:22.558 --> 07:24.593
Everybody just stay cool.

07:24.594 --> 07:27.629
What purpose will it serve
to lower the temperature?

07:27.630 --> 07:29.464
Rhomann Dey?

07:29.465 --> 07:31.366
Oh, man, you know, I haven't seen you

07:31.367 --> 07:34.603
since I saved your family
and your entire planet.

07:34.604 --> 07:36.538
Which is why I was confused

07:36.539 --> 07:39.641
when the Corps got a tip that
you'd stolen a dozen moombas

07:39.642 --> 07:41.610
from a local sanctuary.

07:41.611 --> 07:43.578
Care to explain, Quill?

07:43.579 --> 07:45.180
Moombas?

07:45.181 --> 07:47.282
What are moombas?

07:47.283 --> 07:51.319
<i>That would be the animals currently
flying alongside your ship.</i>

07:51.320 --> 07:54.322
Hey, how did they get off the ship?

07:54.323 --> 07:56.625
Not that they were ever on.

07:56.626 --> 07:59.461
That's what I was trying to tell you.

07:59.462 --> 08:02.364
Sorry, Quill, but I'm gonna
have to put you all under arrest

08:02.365 --> 08:05.433
for trafficking in endangered animals.

08:05.434 --> 08:08.370
It is we who are in
danger. Observe the moombas.

08:08.371 --> 08:10.572
What's so dangerous
about a light show?

08:10.573 --> 08:13.608
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe when it turns into this?

08:19.348 --> 08:21.416
Quill, what's happening?

08:21.417 --> 08:25.353
Offhand, I'd say we're being
sucked into a weird portal thingy.

08:29.392 --> 08:31.493
I told you moombas cannot be trusted.

08:31.494 --> 08:33.361
They will destroy us all.

08:33.361 --> 08:35.530
You know what, Drax?
I'm starting to believe you.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.299
Huh?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.953
<i>Milano, correct your course.</i>

08:41.953 --> 08:44.121
Do not enter that portal.

08:44.123 --> 08:47.292
You think I want to go in there?

08:47.293 --> 08:49.194
I don't think
we've got much of a choice.

08:59.305 --> 09:02.073
Okay, what just happened?

09:02.074 --> 09:04.276
I warned you moombas can
appear out of nowhere.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.345
Moombas have always been
said to travel vast distances.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.180
I think we just found out how they do it.

09:10.249 --> 09:11.950
You got that right.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.185
We're 1.000 light years
closer to Conjunction.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.922
Looks like the moombas are
headed down to that moon.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.123
Two words,

09:18.124 --> 09:19.991
cook-out.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.329
Yeah, sitting in dirt
near a lame-o heat source

09:24.330 --> 09:26.998
is everyone's dream.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.900
Uh, just think.

09:28.901 --> 09:31.002
All my life I dreamed of being a cowboy,

09:31.003 --> 09:33.238
and all I had to do was
get abducted by aliens.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.176
And now we shall feast

09:38.177 --> 09:40.245
as the warriors of old did.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.081
That's not moomba, is it?

09:43.082 --> 09:46.952
I would never ingest
such treacherous animals.

09:46.953 --> 09:50.221
They'd likely poison their own
flesh just to spite their predators.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.223
I am on to your tactics.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.095
How about an old Earth tradition?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.930
Singing round the campfire.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.166
Uh, where did you... Came with the hat.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.902
Now, this song
is a ritual among my people,

10:03.903 --> 10:06.371
passed down during mass gatherings
of youth during the warmer climates.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.408
<i>♪ Well...</i>

10:10.409 --> 10:13.278
<i>♪ A-great green gobs of
greasy grimy gopher guts</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:14.379
<i>♪ Mutilated monkey meat</i>

10:14.380 --> 10:16.982
<i>♪ Little birdy's bloody feet ♪</i>

10:18.117 --> 10:22.253
Are you comparing my food
to this inedible dish?

10:22.254 --> 10:24.189
What? No.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.091
Everyone loves your food.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.137
I just remembered another Earth tradition.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.314
Oh, it tastes worse on the way out.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.950
Hmm, unusual custom.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.056
Look over there!

10:59.258 --> 11:01.026
Well, I'm stuffed.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.195
Rocket, they're not supposed
to eat anything but grass.

11:04.196 --> 11:07.165
No, no! Ugh! No!

11:10.202 --> 11:13.171
Moombas have been plotting
against us this entire time,

11:13.172 --> 11:15.106
and you mock me.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.148
Huh?

11:24.016 --> 11:25.216
Check this out.

11:25.217 --> 11:27.952
The moombas have been injected
with an explosive compound,

11:27.953 --> 11:30.355
but it only reacts to a
certain kind of protein.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.190
Don't eat meat, no problem.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.358
But if they do...

11:33.359 --> 11:36.294
Then the moombas are boombas!

11:36.295 --> 11:38.263
Ha! I can't believe I
didn't think of it myself.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.265
These things could take out a small moon.

11:40.266 --> 11:43.268
Or an artificial
planetoid, like Conjunction.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.070
Got this off the alpha moomba.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.240
<i>Greetings, dear brother...</i>

11:49.241 --> 11:52.043
<i>Or what is left of you.</i>

11:52.044 --> 11:53.945
<i>And, oh, yes...</i>

11:53.946 --> 11:55.346
<i>I win.</i>

11:56.415 --> 11:58.983
The Collector was playing us.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.119
He was going to blow up his brother
even if it meant taking us with him.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.221
And you're surprised?

12:03.222 --> 12:06.324
Let's get out of here while we still
only have one boomba to deal with.

12:06.325 --> 12:11.262
Yeah. About that.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.098
We need to drive
the herd into space,

12:13.099 --> 12:16.167
where they won't do so much damage.

12:16.168 --> 12:19.070
I will continue to monitor
the perimeter from the ship.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.940
Ha-ha! Ravagers, come on!

12:21.941 --> 12:24.075
Hey!

12:24.076 --> 12:27.078
Well,
nice hat you got there.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.182
Yondu? What are you doing here?

12:35.354 --> 12:37.188
What's it look like, boy-o?

12:37.189 --> 12:39.290
We're taking your moombas.

12:41.994 --> 12:45.997
Yeah, lots of luck getting these
things to go where they don't want to.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.166
Already got that
one figured out, boy-o.

12:56.308 --> 13:00.979
Yondu, wait. The moombas,
they're gonna explode.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.181
Why
else would we want them?

13:03.182 --> 13:05.016
The Collector and the Grandmaster

13:05.017 --> 13:07.285
have been trying to off
each other for years.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.188
That's why Grandmaster's
got us taking these moombas

13:10.189 --> 13:12.123
back to his brother on Knowhere,

13:12.124 --> 13:14.959
to blow him up instead.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.327
If you want to blow up Knowhere, Yondu,

13:16.328 --> 13:18.196
then you'll have to blow me up with it.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.004
Gonna miss you, boy-o.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.005
Yondu...

13:27.406 --> 13:29.207
I'm serious. Yondu!

13:35.214 --> 13:36.281
I am Groot.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.949
Quill!

13:41.971 --> 13:44.205
Curse you, foul moombas!

13:44.206 --> 13:47.876
I swear to you, Peter
Quill will be avenged.

13:47.877 --> 13:50.044
Save the speech. Quill's alive.

13:50.045 --> 13:53.114
But not for much longer, with those
moombas set to blow up Knowhere.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.987
Fall back. He means to attack.

14:00.856 --> 14:03.958
Ech, of course, the friendly ones stay.

14:03.959 --> 14:05.159
No, this is good.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.928
We can use this one to generate a portal

14:06.929 --> 14:08.763
and catch up with the rest of the herd.

14:10.699 --> 14:11.799
Aah!

14:14.737 --> 14:16.170
I am not in favor of this plan.

14:16.171 --> 14:17.872
I am Groot.

14:17.873 --> 14:19.774
What do you mean, make an antidote?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.075
Antidotes don't grow on trees.

14:22.044 --> 14:24.112
Or do they?

14:24.113 --> 14:27.982
Drax, keep Bessie corralled while
we cook up a cure for the booms.

14:29.885 --> 14:32.086
I'm less in favor of this plan...

14:53.075 --> 14:54.108
Ha!

15:06.922 --> 15:08.723
Huh?

15:11.727 --> 15:13.027
I lived. I lived!

15:13.028 --> 15:14.963
Nice job, Drax.

15:14.964 --> 15:18.700
Now, let's see if we can't do the
same for the folks on Knowhere.

15:18.701 --> 15:19.968
Take cover!

15:22.738 --> 15:25.907
Ew. Disgusting.

15:25.908 --> 15:28.710
But, and I never thought
I'd be happy to say this,

15:28.711 --> 15:29.911
it didn't blow up.

15:29.912 --> 15:31.746
Now, let's ride!

15:33.148 --> 15:34.949
Hyah.

15:34.950 --> 15:37.719
Hey, I said let's ride. Go.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.121
Come on, you krutakin' flarg!

15:40.122 --> 15:42.023
I am Drax the Destroyer,

15:42.024 --> 15:44.058
and I will not let innocents perish

15:44.059 --> 15:45.159
because of my fear.

15:46.128 --> 15:48.930
Okay, fine. You drive.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.798
Hi-yo, moomba.

15:55.237 --> 15:56.804
Element blaster.

15:56.805 --> 15:58.840
Okay, that's embarrassing.

16:02.811 --> 16:03.978
Ah!

16:03.979 --> 16:06.014
Oh, I was totally going to say that.

16:06.982 --> 16:09.117
Ravagers, get that moomba.

16:14.923 --> 16:17.058
First you must catch that moomba.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.060
Who's going to catch me?

16:21.096 --> 16:22.830
Thanks, bud.

16:22.831 --> 16:25.733
Uh, much as I hate to say
it, let's diffuse some bombs.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.983
It's all right. Totally
got this one under control.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.023
Forget something?

16:49.024 --> 16:50.858
I also had a hat.

16:50.859 --> 16:52.827
And you'll have to fight Drax for it.

17:12.013 --> 17:13.915
Howdy,
part-en-er.

17:13.915 --> 17:17.050
How you say, "Cavalry has arrived"?

17:17.051 --> 17:20.821
Since when does one telepathic
fleabag count as cavalry?

17:24.926 --> 17:26.828
Eh, show off.

17:29.898 --> 17:30.932
Freeze!

17:35.003 --> 17:37.705
The first person to move or whistle

17:37.706 --> 17:41.008
gets blasted back to
their home planet. Got it?

17:41.009 --> 17:45.012
Well, who says you can't find
a corpsman when you need one?

17:45.013 --> 17:48.983
Me and my Ravagers were just
returning these here stolen animals

17:48.984 --> 17:50.785
back to their rightful owner

17:50.786 --> 17:53.955
when these scruffy
ne'er-do-wells attacked.

17:53.956 --> 17:56.057
Hey, you attacked first.

17:56.058 --> 17:57.892
And I am not scruffy.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.894
Is true, Colonel. Quill was...

17:59.895 --> 18:01.763
Transporting moombas,

18:01.764 --> 18:04.832
which are illegal to
own in the first place.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.834
Why do none of you remember that?

18:06.835 --> 18:09.871
Who did you say these
animals belonged to again?

18:11.774 --> 18:13.741
The Collector.

18:13.742 --> 18:18.146
Mr. Collector, it would appear that I
have some of your very illegal property,

18:18.147 --> 18:20.748
as in one dozen moombas.

18:20.749 --> 18:22.016
<i>Moombas?</i>

18:22.017 --> 18:23.851
<i>I am sorry, corpsman,</i>

18:23.852 --> 18:25.820
<i>but while moombas are rare,</i>

18:25.821 --> 18:28.156
<i>they are hardly rare enough for me.</i>

18:28.157 --> 18:29.991
He hired us to
take them to Conjunction

18:29.992 --> 18:32.160
so he could blow up his brother
with their explosive cud.

18:36.098 --> 18:40.034
Uh, Quill, explosive
spitballs heading your way.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.169
Say what?

18:41.170 --> 18:44.872
Is true. Cosmo read Collector's mind.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.041
<i>These two terrans
are obviously lying</i>

18:47.042 --> 18:48.876
<i>to protect one another.</i>

18:49.978 --> 18:51.179
Well...

18:57.920 --> 19:01.088
Well, I ain't one to look
a gift getaway in the mouth.

19:01.089 --> 19:02.990
Ravagers, let's ride.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.964
<i>I am, uh...</i>

19:09.965 --> 19:14.869
<i>I am sorry, corpsman. I seem
to be experiencing...</i>

19:14.870 --> 19:16.971
Corpsmen, get the Ravagers!

19:16.972 --> 19:17.972
Go!

19:21.143 --> 19:23.010
Dey, we have an antidote.

19:23.011 --> 19:26.047
Come on, Dey. We're the
Guardians of the Galaxy.

19:26.048 --> 19:27.882
I am Groot.

19:27.883 --> 19:30.718
We can find some space
cow statue thingies a good home.

19:35.057 --> 19:36.958
That isn't exactly procedure.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.793
<i>Shields at 40%.</i>

19:38.794 --> 19:41.762
Look, give me your word they'll be safe,

19:41.763 --> 19:42.830
and you can go.

19:42.831 --> 19:44.866
You got it, partner.

19:49.204 --> 19:51.906
What exactly do you have in mind?

19:51.907 --> 19:53.007
You'll see...

19:53.008 --> 19:54.942
As soon as I get my hat back.

19:56.812 --> 19:58.079
You got it, partner.

20:02.818 --> 20:04.919
Approaching the gravity storm.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.787
Drax, it's up to you.

20:07.890 --> 20:09.824
It is up to us.

20:11.093 --> 20:12.727
Now, my new friends,

20:12.728 --> 20:15.029
Drax the Destroyer bids
you to lead the way.

20:26.108 --> 20:30.011
Huh, using the moombas to get
us through the gravity storm.

20:30.012 --> 20:33.014
You actually had a good idea, partner.

20:33.015 --> 20:35.149
Now, assuming this treasure map X

20:35.150 --> 20:37.184
is finally marking the spot,

20:37.185 --> 20:39.153
let's go find us a cosmic seed.

20:40.856 --> 20:42.089
Oh, Drax.

20:42.090 --> 20:43.925
Dude, you got a really big head.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.234
Of course, it's not here.

20:53.235 --> 20:55.836
At least we know where we head next.

20:55.837 --> 20:58.239
Plus the moombas found
themselves an isolated planet,

20:58.240 --> 21:01.842
with plenty of cosmic
seed-grown grazing land.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.144
They will be safe here.

21:03.145 --> 21:04.912
You saved a noble species.

21:04.913 --> 21:07.949
Noble ain't the word
that's springing to mind.

21:07.950 --> 21:10.785
Go on. Get off. Go!

21:10.786 --> 21:12.753
Or I'll... I'll blow you up myself.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.826
I am Groot?

21:18.827 --> 21:21.929
I was not crying.

21:21.930 --> 21:24.932
Nor was I.

21:24.933 --> 21:27.001
Now, who is ready to eat?

21:28.103 --> 21:29.136
Not me!
