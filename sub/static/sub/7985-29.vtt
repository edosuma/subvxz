00:01.227 --> 00:02.721
ABBY LEE:
<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:02.721 --> 00:04.056
JoJo.

00:04.056 --> 00:05.058
I'm not gonna be
be below the minis

00:05.058 --> 00:06.227
on a pyramid.
This is stupid.

00:06.227 --> 00:09.333
<i>I am so pissed</i>
<i>at Abby right now.</i>

00:09.333 --> 00:10.469
You are not gonna ruin her!

00:10.469 --> 00:11.772
ABBY LEE:
I wasn't trying to.

00:11.772 --> 00:13.976
This week,
you are not competing.

00:13.976 --> 00:15.546
What?
NIA:
Whoa!

00:15.546 --> 00:16.782
I still see five

00:16.782 --> 00:19.688
<i>individual dancers</i>
<i>instead of one group.</i>

00:19.688 --> 00:21.190
KENDALL:
<i>Every time I have a duet,</i>

00:21.190 --> 00:22.092
somebody leaves.

00:22.092 --> 00:24.330
Nia's sick.

00:24.330 --> 00:27.904
Our top elite team small group,
"Mind Craft."

00:27.904 --> 00:29.508
(audience cheering)

00:29.508 --> 00:30.510
JILL:
<i>Instead of coming out</i>

00:30.510 --> 00:32.781
and saying,
"Congratulations on your win,"

00:32.781 --> 00:33.749
you have to bring us down.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.955
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:36.955 --> 00:38.559
This weekend
was the worst.

00:38.559 --> 00:41.297
ABBY LEE: <i>A girl who Kalani</i>
<i>and Kira knew personally</i>

00:41.297 --> 00:42.266
committed suicide.

00:42.266 --> 00:44.604
<i>The name of the routine</i>

00:44.604 --> 00:46.909
is "Suicide Hotline."

00:46.909 --> 00:49.581
<i>Let's do something</i>
<i>to save a kid's life.</i>

00:51.084 --> 00:53.021
So we have two duets.

00:53.021 --> 00:55.526
The duets will be going up
against each other.

00:55.526 --> 00:56.662
JESSALYNN:
<i>We're not doing the duo.</i>

00:56.662 --> 00:58.732
We're not doing it.
JoJo's not doing the duo.

00:58.732 --> 01:00.803
ABBY LEE:
<i>Where is JoJo?</i>

01:00.803 --> 01:01.705
We haven't seen her today.

01:01.705 --> 01:02.941
ASHLEE:
<i>JoJo and Jess have</i>

01:02.941 --> 01:04.143
just left us high and dry.

01:04.143 --> 01:06.080
SARI: <i>After being benched,</i>
<i>they have to prove</i>

01:06.080 --> 01:07.149
<i>to Abby that they should be</i>

01:07.149 --> 01:08.786
dancing week after week.

01:08.786 --> 01:12.894
ANNOUNCER: And first place
in our teen advanced group...

01:12.894 --> 01:15.867
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:15.867 --> 01:18.639
♪ ♪

01:23.816 --> 01:25.620
JILL:
Go stretch, KK.

01:25.620 --> 01:27.289
I want to go back there.

01:27.289 --> 01:29.193
Arizona's, like,
100 every day now.

01:29.193 --> 01:30.696
KIRA:
<i>I went home this</i>

01:30.696 --> 01:32.567
past weekend because

01:32.567 --> 01:33.903
<i>we lost</i>

01:33.903 --> 01:35.172
a young dancer

01:35.172 --> 01:36.842
<i>from Arizona in the most</i>

01:36.842 --> 01:38.278
<i>tragic way you could possibly</i>

01:38.278 --> 01:40.148
lose a child.

01:40.148 --> 01:41.552
<i>Suicide.</i>

01:41.552 --> 01:43.221
Teen suicide.

01:43.221 --> 01:44.991
This weekend
was the worst.

01:44.991 --> 01:48.398
It was really hard on Sunday,
like, really hard.

01:48.398 --> 01:52.139
It's... I‐I just can't
think about this.

01:52.139 --> 01:54.176
JILL:
It's so sad.

01:54.176 --> 01:56.347
I don't think
our girls are aware

01:56.347 --> 01:58.117
<i>that there are kids</i>

01:58.117 --> 02:00.388
their age and younger
who are suicidal,

02:00.388 --> 02:01.725
<i>who have depression,</i>

02:01.725 --> 02:04.463
and who just need
somebody to talk to.

02:04.463 --> 02:06.400
<i>I told Abby</i>
<i>what had happened,</i>

02:06.400 --> 02:08.404
<i>and it's gonna be</i>
<i>an emotional week.</i>

02:08.404 --> 02:12.580
<i>But I really feel that</i>
<i>we need to address it head‐on.</i>

02:12.580 --> 02:15.085
ABBY LEE:
Okay, girls?

02:15.085 --> 02:17.557
You didn't dance last week,
so you're not on the pyramid.

02:17.557 --> 02:21.230
There's no sense of you coming
to pyramid and all your mothers

02:21.230 --> 02:24.871
wasting time and babies
crying and all that stuff.

02:24.871 --> 02:26.140
We don't have time for that.

02:26.140 --> 02:28.478
We have a lot
of numbers happening.

02:28.478 --> 02:31.250
Uh, Chris is back today,
and he is going

02:31.250 --> 02:34.724
<i>to work on a jazz routine</i>
<i>with you.</i>

02:34.724 --> 02:36.160
Chris, you want to explain

02:36.160 --> 02:37.930
a little bit to the moms and
the girls what they're doing?

02:37.930 --> 02:41.137
Yeah, so basically, this routine
is about girl empowerment.

02:41.137 --> 02:42.540
I want them to become

02:42.540 --> 02:43.575
women for a week.

02:43.575 --> 02:44.744
So I want you guys

02:44.744 --> 02:46.147
to act like women for a week.

02:46.147 --> 02:47.750
It's all about
being invincible.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.852
Being warriors.

02:48.852 --> 02:50.956
ABBY LEE:
All right?
You're going to compete it.

02:50.956 --> 02:53.094
If everything goes well,

02:53.094 --> 02:55.365
you'll be on that stage dancing.

02:55.365 --> 02:57.169
All right?

02:57.169 --> 02:59.073
<i>The minis were benched</i>
<i>last week because</i>

02:59.073 --> 02:59.908
<i>they don't know</i>
<i>how to work together</i>

02:59.908 --> 03:02.547
<i>as a team, but yet, my elites,</i>

03:02.547 --> 03:05.653
<i>who work great as a team,</i>
<i>aren't winning.</i>

03:05.653 --> 03:07.222
Our three soloists,

03:07.222 --> 03:08.324
<i>they all fell short.</i>

03:08.324 --> 03:09.460
<i>That's not in keeping</i>

03:09.460 --> 03:11.297
with the standards
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

03:11.297 --> 03:13.468
<i>I need to invest my time,</i>

03:13.468 --> 03:15.405
<i>my expertise,</i>
<i>into these minis.</i>

03:15.405 --> 03:18.244
<i>Maybe one of the little ones</i>
<i>want to be Maddie.</i>

03:18.244 --> 03:20.883
Because the older ones
obviously don't.

03:20.883 --> 03:22.787
Your hair looks good.

03:22.787 --> 03:25.158
Thank you.
I cut it myself today.

03:25.158 --> 03:26.695
I took my Hobby Lobby scissors

03:26.695 --> 03:28.398
and cut my hair today
in the bathroom.

03:28.398 --> 03:30.201
ASHLEE:
You cut your hair,
and then did you do

03:30.201 --> 03:31.437
JoJo's makeup?

03:31.437 --> 03:32.439
Kalani did
JoJo's makeup.

03:32.439 --> 03:33.742
They had a shoot today.

03:33.742 --> 03:35.278
And JoJo liked it, so
she wanted to leave it on,

03:35.278 --> 03:37.282
and I was like,
"Abby won't care."

03:37.282 --> 03:40.088
Uh, yeah, she missed
a ballet private this morning.

03:40.088 --> 03:42.860
So...

03:42.860 --> 03:44.363
All right, congratulations
are in order.

03:44.363 --> 03:45.833
You won last week.

03:45.833 --> 03:47.436
(all cheering)

03:47.436 --> 03:49.473
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>you're incredible dancers</i>

03:49.473 --> 03:52.880
<i>or you're just good</i>
<i>at playing games?</i>

03:52.880 --> 03:54.684
Uh, unfortunately,

03:54.684 --> 03:57.657
you know, there's always
good news and bad news.

03:57.657 --> 03:59.961
So, the good news
is the group won.

03:59.961 --> 04:03.569
The bad news is our solos
didn't fare as well.

04:03.569 --> 04:06.240
I picked three kids to do solos

04:06.240 --> 04:09.179
and didn't
have a winner.

04:09.179 --> 04:10.583
I had three shots

04:10.583 --> 04:13.020
to get that first
place overall.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.624
So don't count
on any more solos.

04:14.624 --> 04:17.897
All right, let's
get to the pyramid.

04:17.897 --> 04:21.070
On the bottom
of the pyramid... JoJo.

04:21.070 --> 04:23.575
You're not here
because of your performance.

04:23.575 --> 04:27.984
<i>I don't think anyone's gonna</i>
<i>argue your performance value.</i>

04:27.984 --> 04:29.319
That's not
the problem.

04:29.319 --> 04:31.825
When you look in the mirror
and you see your leg out there,

04:31.825 --> 04:33.662
you think that leg
is just swell.

04:33.662 --> 04:35.633
Or good enough.

04:35.633 --> 04:37.202
And I don't want a dancer

04:37.202 --> 04:39.574
to <i>ever</i> think
they are good enough.

04:39.574 --> 04:42.279
That is keeping you

04:42.279 --> 04:44.918
from fixing your mistakes.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.557
JESSALYNN:
<i>It's sad to see JoJo lose.</i>

04:47.557 --> 04:48.792
<i>I need her to win.</i>

04:48.792 --> 04:49.827
<i>We need a win.</i>

04:49.827 --> 04:51.497
I am in California

04:51.497 --> 04:53.100
<i>to make JoJo a star.</i>

04:53.100 --> 04:54.604
<i>To make her famous.</i>

04:54.604 --> 04:55.606
<i>Everybody that meets her</i>

04:55.606 --> 04:56.641
<i>says she has a gift.</i>

04:56.641 --> 04:57.843
She has a personality.

04:57.843 --> 04:58.845
She's unbelievable.

04:58.845 --> 05:01.016
<i>It's like she</i>

05:01.016 --> 05:02.152
would love to be

05:02.152 --> 05:03.655
<i>the next Kim Kardashian.</i>

05:03.655 --> 05:05.659
Next...

05:05.659 --> 05:08.097
we have Kendall.

05:08.097 --> 05:11.170
So, somebody
coming in seventh,

05:11.170 --> 05:14.009
that's not in keeping
with the Abby Lee Dance Company.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.113
You know,

05:16.113 --> 05:18.719
I don't want to name names.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.254
But I could usually count
on somebody winning.

05:20.254 --> 05:21.323
Not all the time.

05:21.323 --> 05:22.727
But a lot of the time.

05:24.262 --> 05:27.369
Next, we have Kalani.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.072
You were fourth.

05:29.072 --> 05:30.776
<i>Kalani, you did</i>

05:30.776 --> 05:33.447
<i>"On the Edge of My Seat."</i>
<i>I was enraptured</i>

05:33.447 --> 05:34.617
<i>in your performance.</i>

05:34.617 --> 05:36.387
I thought it
was beautiful.

05:36.387 --> 05:37.590
And what I like
about your dancing

05:37.590 --> 05:39.326
is that you make it look easy.

05:39.326 --> 05:40.495
I wanted to
jump up there

05:40.495 --> 05:41.698
and do that same
number myself,

05:41.698 --> 05:43.100
because she made it
look so easy.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.044
Next we have Nia.

05:48.044 --> 05:50.649
I thought you were outstanding
in the group dance.

05:50.649 --> 05:52.452
<i>You entertain me,</i>
<i>and I watched you</i>

05:52.452 --> 05:55.191
<i>and you looked great</i>
<i>right in my face</i>

05:55.191 --> 05:56.460
doing all the
funky stuff,

05:56.460 --> 05:57.997
so outstanding.

05:57.997 --> 06:00.636
And at the top
of the pyramid,

06:00.636 --> 06:03.608
our game winner, Brynn.

06:03.608 --> 06:05.979
<i>I think maybe Brynn</i>
<i>was the best</i>

06:05.979 --> 06:07.817
<i>game player of the week.</i>

06:07.817 --> 06:10.154
BRYNN:
<i>I don't know how I'm on top</i>

06:10.154 --> 06:12.560
of the pyramid,
but I guess playing <i>Minecraft</i>

06:12.560 --> 06:14.463
all the time paid off.

06:14.463 --> 06:16.233
All right, this week,

06:16.233 --> 06:18.638
we are traveling to Calabasas.

06:18.638 --> 06:21.243
(cheering)

06:21.243 --> 06:22.245
And we're attending

06:22.245 --> 06:23.280
Fierce Competition.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.318
Now, I said no solos,

06:25.318 --> 06:27.188
so we have two duets.

06:27.188 --> 06:29.527
The duets will be going up
against each other.

06:33.635 --> 06:35.639
We have our first duet...

06:38.512 --> 06:41.283
...is going to Brynn

06:41.283 --> 06:42.720
and Nia.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.857
(all cheering)

06:44.857 --> 06:48.532
The name of the routine
is "War and Peace."

06:48.532 --> 06:50.034
(all murmuring)

06:50.034 --> 06:51.871
It depicts a soldier

06:51.871 --> 06:54.644
from our United States
military and

06:54.644 --> 06:57.817
a '60s antiwar flower child.

06:57.817 --> 06:58.852
Oh, interesting.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.188
(gasps)

07:00.188 --> 07:02.526
This dance is all
about the protest.

07:02.526 --> 07:04.262
People were rallying
against the war.

07:04.262 --> 07:05.966
"Let our guys come home."

07:05.966 --> 07:07.235
And women.

07:07.235 --> 07:08.470
"Let them come home.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.776
Why are they fighting this war
when it's not our war?"

07:10.776 --> 07:12.045
All these
different things.

07:12.045 --> 07:13.682
And that's what we're
gonna put on the stage.

07:13.682 --> 07:17.121
Now, my next duet

07:17.121 --> 07:20.328
is kind of on the other
end of the pyramid here.

07:20.328 --> 07:22.365
It's JoJo and Kendall.

07:22.365 --> 07:24.537
(cheering)

07:24.537 --> 07:26.608
<i>JoJo and Kendall</i>

07:26.608 --> 07:29.547
were my two lowest‐ranking
soloists last week.

07:29.547 --> 07:32.151
Because their technique
is just not up to par.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.790
<i>I'm giving the two</i>
<i>of them something</i>

07:34.790 --> 07:37.362
we rarely do in competition.

07:37.362 --> 07:39.934
<i>Because it's about</i>
<i>challenging these kids</i>

07:39.934 --> 07:43.541
<i>to push themselves every</i>
<i>weekend for a competition.</i>

07:43.541 --> 07:45.378
So, the two of you,

07:45.378 --> 07:47.583
you are doing

07:47.583 --> 07:48.952
a ballet routine.

07:48.952 --> 07:50.555
It will be in the
ballet category.

07:50.555 --> 07:51.557
However,
it's a contemporary ballet.

07:54.396 --> 07:56.668
We never do ballet routines.

07:56.668 --> 07:59.072
Ever!
We are now.

07:59.072 --> 08:02.245
It's entitled "Push and Pull."

08:02.245 --> 08:03.113
Cool.

08:03.113 --> 08:04.282
JOJO:
<i>I'm literally</i>

08:04.282 --> 08:06.119
<i>freaking out, like,</i>

08:06.119 --> 08:08.390
<i>I'm not really like</i>
<i>the ballet technique type.</i>

08:08.390 --> 08:09.492
<i>Like, my legs and feet,</i>

08:09.492 --> 08:11.096
they're good,
but they're not perfect.

08:11.096 --> 08:13.501
And so jazz is, like,
really my thing.

08:13.501 --> 08:17.108
<i>I have to just work really hard</i>
<i>on my technique.</i>

08:17.108 --> 08:18.410
I really have to nail it.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.549
ABBY LEE:
Now, the group routine.

08:20.549 --> 08:22.853
This is a very
mature subject.

08:22.853 --> 08:24.590
The name of
the routine is

08:24.590 --> 08:26.794
"Suicide Hotline."

08:28.297 --> 08:31.537
<i>The news traveled rapidly</i>
<i>throughout the dance community.</i>

08:31.537 --> 08:34.610
A girl in Phoenix, Arizona,
who Kalani

08:34.610 --> 08:36.313
<i>and Kira knew personally,</i>

08:36.313 --> 08:38.283
<i>committed suicide.</i>

08:39.787 --> 08:41.858
It's devastating

08:41.858 --> 08:43.828
<i>to a family, to...</i>

08:45.599 --> 08:47.569
...an entire town.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.675
<i>I want to do a routine</i>
<i>that is going to</i>

08:50.675 --> 08:52.513
<i>serve a purpose.</i>
<i>It's about</i>

08:52.513 --> 08:54.182
<i>teaching a lesson</i>

08:54.182 --> 08:55.384
and saving a life.

08:55.384 --> 08:57.956
So is it awareness?

08:57.956 --> 08:59.760
It's awareness.
It's a‐‐ it's a story.
Or...?

08:59.760 --> 09:03.200
It's how the
hotline works.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.004
How the phones are answered.

09:05.004 --> 09:06.239
What takes place

09:06.239 --> 09:08.343
during a phone call.

09:08.343 --> 09:10.782
It's‐it's about keeping
someone on the line.

09:10.782 --> 09:13.353
It's more about the
actual hotline than

09:13.353 --> 09:14.355
the act.

09:14.355 --> 09:16.527
No disrespect.
I think

09:16.527 --> 09:19.600
a dance of this magnitude,
awareness is pivotal.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.936
It's something I think

09:20.936 --> 09:23.307
will touch a lot of hearts
and nerves for kids.

09:23.307 --> 09:25.545
Are you in
a good place

09:25.545 --> 09:27.081
to really give it
your full attention?

09:27.081 --> 09:28.383
ABBY LEE: I'm willing
to take the risks.

09:28.383 --> 09:29.553
I take risks every day.

09:29.553 --> 09:31.289
I'm willing to take that risk.
I believe in you guys.

09:31.289 --> 09:33.928
I want to bring in
somebody coming

09:33.928 --> 09:36.299
from the teen suicide
prevention hotline.

09:36.299 --> 09:37.836
JILL:
Like a therapist or...

09:37.836 --> 09:39.172
HOLLY: Probably a counselor
from the hotline.

09:39.172 --> 09:40.307
JILL: Counselor‐‐
that's the word.

09:40.307 --> 09:42.445
Which we need to

09:42.445 --> 09:43.648
figure out the dancing
and the music

09:43.648 --> 09:44.683
and everything else.

09:44.683 --> 09:46.052
JESSALYNN:
Well, let's get started.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.658
We know what we're doing.
Yeah, let's get started.

09:48.658 --> 09:50.662
I got to get my mind straight
for this group.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.435
<i>The name of the</i>

09:54.435 --> 09:57.676
organization
is called Teen Line.

09:57.676 --> 10:00.147
And you're telling the story,
and there's no one to help you.

10:00.147 --> 10:02.185
You're not calling.

10:02.185 --> 10:05.391
And then finally, at the end,
when the red phone rings,

10:05.391 --> 10:07.796
you‐you're like,
you made the call,

10:07.796 --> 10:09.733
and you're reaching for help
and it's like...

10:09.733 --> 10:11.971
And they go‐‐ and they lose you.

10:11.971 --> 10:13.340
And you... (chittering)

10:13.340 --> 10:14.342
And...

10:14.342 --> 10:16.681
<i>they failed.</i>

10:16.681 --> 10:18.350
Right.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.689
JILL:
<i>I looked up Teen Line,</i>

10:20.689 --> 10:22.526
and it is teens helping teens.

10:22.526 --> 10:24.429
ASHLEE: Yeah, I think the worst
thing is when you feel alone.

10:24.429 --> 10:26.601
And nobody understands.

10:26.601 --> 10:28.337
And I guess teenagers
always think teenagers

10:28.337 --> 10:30.241
understand them, you know?

10:30.241 --> 10:31.811
HOLLY:
Peers influence each other

10:31.811 --> 10:33.180
a great deal.

10:33.180 --> 10:34.750
ASHLEE: Well, that's the thing.
They're hearing about

10:34.750 --> 10:36.453
<i>all this stuff, whether</i>
<i>we want to admit it or not.</i>

10:36.453 --> 10:38.658
<i>They're hearing about suicide.</i>

10:38.658 --> 10:39.660
They're hearing
about abuse.

10:39.660 --> 10:41.162
They're hearing
about depression.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.365
<i>And if we don't address it</i>

10:42.365 --> 10:43.768
<i>and give them a way</i>
<i>to cope with it,</i>

10:43.768 --> 10:44.837
<i>we're in denial about the fact</i>

10:44.837 --> 10:46.574
that it's out there,
and they're living it,

10:46.574 --> 10:47.943
<i>and they're experiencing it.</i>

10:47.943 --> 10:50.481
<i>It's better to give them</i>
<i>an answer‐‐ at least a tool.</i>

10:50.481 --> 10:52.653
This could be
a powerful piece

10:52.653 --> 10:54.489
that impacts someone
in a really positive‐‐

10:54.489 --> 10:56.560
it could touch someone's life,
and you don't even realize it.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.000
We're gonna go
one, switch, one,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.906
then the people that
are back go forward.

11:02.906 --> 11:05.477
And as she walks by,
you pull it back.

11:05.477 --> 11:07.181
Pull it back, pull
it back, pull it back.

11:07.181 --> 11:10.454
So you're on that edge
of the... of the table.

11:10.454 --> 11:12.091
Like, that way.

11:12.091 --> 11:14.563
One, hold, two.
Three, hold, four.

11:14.563 --> 11:15.765
Five, hold, six.

11:15.765 --> 11:18.938
Go back, back,
back, back.

11:18.938 --> 11:21.309
KIRA:
It is really, really heavy.

11:21.309 --> 11:23.213
It's like... uh!

11:23.213 --> 11:26.286
But, in the same sense,
I like the fact that

11:26.286 --> 11:29.492
she's actually able
to tell the narrative,

11:29.492 --> 11:32.031
and she has a vision.

11:32.031 --> 11:34.536
(sputters)

11:34.536 --> 11:35.972
(bleep)

11:37.475 --> 11:39.078
This is rough.

11:39.078 --> 11:41.182
<i>Let's do something to help.</i>
<i>Let's do something</i>

11:41.182 --> 11:42.953
to teach, because I think
education is key.

11:42.953 --> 11:46.326
<i>And if kids have someone</i>
<i>they can call</i>

11:46.326 --> 11:48.397
<i>and ask for advice, then...</i>

11:48.397 --> 11:50.467
I think the kids will use it.
I really do.

11:50.467 --> 11:53.106
<i>I think kids will use</i>
<i>this hotline</i>

11:53.106 --> 11:55.512
<i>to seek answers</i>
<i>to their questions.</i>

11:55.512 --> 11:59.586
<i>If one kid, just one kid</i>
<i>picks up the telephone</i>

11:59.586 --> 12:00.755
and dials that hotline number,

12:00.755 --> 12:04.863
<i>maybe, just maybe,</i>
<i>we are going to save</i>

12:04.863 --> 12:06.232
a kid's life.

12:15.217 --> 12:18.323
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i>
♪ ♪

12:22.131 --> 12:23.133
ABBY LEE: <i>All right.</i>

12:24.402 --> 12:27.876
You two both know
Daniel, yes?

12:27.876 --> 12:29.412
<i>Daniel is one of our wonderful,</i>

12:29.412 --> 12:32.719
accomplished ballet instructors.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.388
<i>So this week, he has been</i>

12:34.388 --> 12:35.892
<i>assisting</i>
<i>with the choreography.</i>

12:35.892 --> 12:38.263
And I think he's gonna whip
these two into shape.

12:38.263 --> 12:39.933
So,

12:39.933 --> 12:42.506
<i>you both had solos</i>
<i>this past week.</i>

12:42.506 --> 12:43.741
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

12:43.741 --> 12:44.910
they didn't score so well.

12:44.910 --> 12:48.316
So thank you for jumping in
and helping out.

12:48.316 --> 12:50.822
The girls need to work
with other people as well.

12:50.822 --> 12:53.326
Here we are in L. A., and we have
all these people, and it's good.

12:53.326 --> 12:56.132
So you two are doing
a contemporary ballet routine.

12:56.132 --> 13:00.675
We haven't done, really, that
with the Abby Lee Dance Company

13:00.675 --> 13:02.478
<i>at competition.</i>

13:02.478 --> 13:04.115
So I think this is good for you.

13:04.115 --> 13:07.154
Uh, everybody needs

13:07.154 --> 13:08.624
<i>more ballet.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

13:08.624 --> 13:11.730
My L. A. girls have not
been winning,

13:11.730 --> 13:13.333
and even when they do win,

13:13.333 --> 13:16.239
<i>I don't think their technique</i>
<i>is up to snuff.</i>

13:16.239 --> 13:18.511
It's high time
these girls realized

13:18.511 --> 13:21.282
how important their training is.

13:21.282 --> 13:24.957
One, bras bas
on this side, two.

13:24.957 --> 13:28.330
And then we're going again
to shift forward, three, four.

13:28.330 --> 13:29.700
Well, we're starting
our duo.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.670
JILL:
<i>Our ballet duo.</i>

13:31.670 --> 13:32.906
When's the last time we've
ever had a specialty duo?

13:32.906 --> 13:34.108
Never, ever, ever.
Never, no.

13:34.108 --> 13:35.778
Well, ballet‐‐
our kids are not‐‐

13:35.778 --> 13:37.448
this isn't a ballet school.

13:37.448 --> 13:38.651
DANIEL:
<i>There, and then we want to jump</i>

13:38.651 --> 13:40.487
over this, like a relevé tap.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.857
Shoop.

13:41.857 --> 13:43.561
As we're learning
our choreography,

13:43.561 --> 13:45.632
<i>I can just tell by the look</i>
<i>on JoJo's face</i>

13:45.632 --> 13:47.669
<i>that JoJo doesn't really like</i>
<i>this dance.</i>

13:47.669 --> 13:49.940
<i>But I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>because it's ballet,</i>

13:49.940 --> 13:52.579
<i>and I'm just going to say this:</i>
<i>we're not the best at ballet.</i>

13:52.579 --> 13:53.748
<i>So it's gonna be a rough week.</i>

13:55.183 --> 13:56.285
This seems weird.

13:56.285 --> 13:58.924
<i>Kendall and JoJo should've had</i>
<i>the other dance.</i>

13:58.924 --> 14:00.427
This won't be bad,

14:00.427 --> 14:02.097
but it won't score well.

14:02.097 --> 14:03.601
It won't be...
It's not a winning number.

14:03.601 --> 14:06.607
They're gonna rip them apart.

14:06.607 --> 14:08.778
This is so frustrating.

14:08.778 --> 14:10.247
<i>You know what, Abby?</i>

14:10.247 --> 14:12.151
<i>Choreograph a dance</i>
<i>that makes her look good.</i>

14:12.151 --> 14:15.090
<i>It's not rocket science.</i>
<i>It's dance choreography.</i>

14:15.090 --> 14:17.629
I mean, if we look bad
onstage, I care.

14:17.629 --> 14:19.198
<i>JoJo's gonna be</i>
<i>the next big thing.</i>

14:19.198 --> 14:21.570
<i>Her music video's out.</i>
<i>Her song is out.</i>

14:21.570 --> 14:23.541
<i>There's so much other stuff</i>
<i>coming out.</i>

14:23.541 --> 14:25.578
<i>Like, JoJo is branding herself.</i>

14:25.578 --> 14:27.882
<i>Honestly, JoJo has a lot</i>
<i>to lose.</i>

14:27.882 --> 14:30.353
<i>Like, I don't need Abby</i>
<i>bringing us down.</i>

14:30.353 --> 14:33.059
Give her a ballet dance?
Are you kidding me?

14:33.059 --> 14:34.328
It's a joke.

14:34.328 --> 14:35.832
HOLLY: <i>Well, none of our girls</i>
<i>are ballerinas.</i>

14:35.832 --> 14:37.669
JILL:
<i>It's none of our girls' things.</i>

14:38.838 --> 14:39.906
Didn't Nia have a dance

14:39.906 --> 14:41.175
that you were
super against?

14:41.175 --> 14:42.478
Like, was it a dog collar?

14:42.478 --> 14:43.480
What was it?
Tons of them.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.150
You name it,
I was against it.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.054
I mean, there are certain things
as a parent you do have to

14:47.054 --> 14:49.526
stand up.
It's a joke.

14:49.526 --> 14:51.095
DANIEL:
Three, four, and five.

14:51.095 --> 14:53.601
Six, seven, chassé.
And up!

14:53.601 --> 14:54.936
JESSALYNN:
<i>This is bad.</i>

14:54.936 --> 14:56.507
<i>This is not even kinda good.</i>
<i>This is bad.</i>

14:56.507 --> 14:58.744
<i>I don't think Abby realizes</i>

14:58.744 --> 15:00.715
who JoJo really is
and what her potential is

15:00.715 --> 15:02.719
<i>as a dancer.</i>

15:02.719 --> 15:06.159
<i>If JoJo's only shot of winning</i>
<i>this week is on technique,</i>

15:06.159 --> 15:07.629
<i>it's not gonna happen.</i>

15:07.629 --> 15:10.033
<i>I certainly did not</i>
<i>give up everything</i>

15:10.033 --> 15:12.070
<i>for Abby to make JoJo look bad.</i>

15:13.139 --> 15:15.210
It needs a little work,
but it looked good.

15:15.210 --> 15:17.080
Just have confidence
and think.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.686
<i>If there's one thing</i>
<i>you guys can think,</i>

15:19.686 --> 15:22.024
just be super clear
about where you're ending

15:22.024 --> 15:24.061
and where you're
starting from, yeah?

15:24.061 --> 15:26.399
'Cause that's the bits
that kind of get really

15:26.399 --> 15:28.504
<i>fundamentally wrong for me.</i>

15:28.504 --> 15:30.006
Yeah, for you
especially.

15:30.006 --> 15:31.743
<i>Okay, thank you very much.</i>

15:31.743 --> 15:32.712
Thank you.

15:34.215 --> 15:35.985
I think Nia and Brynn have
a really good chance

15:35.985 --> 15:37.454
going up against JoJo
and Kendall.

15:37.454 --> 15:41.162
<i>Because Kendall and JoJo have</i>
<i>never had a ballet duet.</i>

15:41.162 --> 15:45.203
And in all honesty, JoJo's
ballet is not her strong suit.

15:45.203 --> 15:47.341
And I think JoJo would probably
agree with that.

15:47.341 --> 15:51.249
How is the... duo?

15:51.249 --> 15:52.919
JILL: I think
it's gonna be good for you.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.658
You're not doing it?
No. Honey.

15:55.658 --> 15:57.762
JILL:
Oh, JoJo.

15:57.762 --> 15:59.231
HOLLY:
Go take a moment.

15:59.231 --> 16:01.870
Go get some air.
Okay, stop.

16:01.870 --> 16:03.373
Honey, stop.

16:10.487 --> 16:13.259
JESSALYNN: <i>Anybody else wants</i>
<i>to do it, they can have it.</i>

16:13.259 --> 16:14.495
This... this is not
what's gonna happen.

16:14.495 --> 16:15.497
ABBY LEE: What?

16:15.497 --> 16:17.134
We're not doing the duo.

16:17.134 --> 16:18.570
We're not doing it.
JoJo's not doing the duo.

16:18.570 --> 16:19.739
Settle.

16:19.739 --> 16:21.610
Why, why is she crying
about a dance...? Her steps.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.313
It's a plié in a fifth position.
'Cause she thinks she's going
to look terrible onstage...

16:23.313 --> 16:25.050
She didn't look bad at all.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.820
...in front
of a million people.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.524
ASHLEE:
<i>Jess's solution for everything</i>

16:28.524 --> 16:30.393
is to just pull JoJo out.

16:30.393 --> 16:32.164
She never forces JoJo
to do anything

16:32.164 --> 16:33.734
<i>outside her comfort zone.</i>

16:33.734 --> 16:35.604
No wonder JoJo's not getting
any better.

16:35.604 --> 16:38.042
'Cause Jess pulls her
the minute something is hard.

16:38.042 --> 16:39.478
JESSALYNN:
It's stupid!

16:39.478 --> 16:40.648
<i>You're making them look stupid!</i>

Jess is building

of her child, like we all are.

20:26.699 --> 20:29.004

but I think

20:29.004 --> 20:30.674

20:30.674 --> 20:32.845

and a dance teacher, Jill,

20:32.845 --> 20:34.147
she should have
kicked that kid's butt

20:34.147 --> 20:35.784

said "You know what?

you get stronger."

20:41.128 --> 20:42.230

I wanted her to?

20:42.230 --> 20:43.733

20:43.733 --> 20:45.369
without a duet.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.873
Well, Ari will fill in.

when your back was injured.

21:20.106 --> 21:25.383
Then, you jumped into her duet
when she was sick.

21:25.383 --> 21:29.357
And now, JoJo has left us
in this predicament again.

21:29.357 --> 21:31.428

<i>till competition,</i>

<i>cut out for her.</i>

<i>I am quite shocked,</i>
<i>to be all honest,</i>

22:20.961 --> 22:22.397

22:22.397 --> 22:24.034

22:25.837 --> 22:28.677

22:28.677 --> 22:31.683
fully dedicated to the team,

22:31.683 --> 22:33.853

to jump ship

22:33.853 --> 22:35.691
because her kid
got a ballet duet.

22:35.691 --> 22:38.596
Last night,
or when we left here,

22:38.596 --> 22:40.433

22:40.433 --> 22:42.070
she feels like
she's being sabotaged.

22:42.070 --> 22:45.476

want to do ballet.

22:45.476 --> 22:46.478
Let's call it what it is.

22:46.478 --> 22:47.915
No, JoJo did not want to
do ballet.

22:47.915 --> 22:51.188
But how many times have they
been upset and we all go,

22:51.188 --> 22:52.825
"You got to do it anyways.

22:52.825 --> 22:54.695
Sorry, this is the hand
you were dealt."

22:54.695 --> 22:56.231
I'm the first parent that's,
"Suck it up,

22:56.231 --> 22:57.601
get in the room, and do it."

22:57.601 --> 22:59.839
It's so irritating,
this double standard with Jess.

22:59.839 --> 23:02.511
I... it makes my skin crawl.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.347
We're in here doing the group,
she's in the bathroom

23:04.347 --> 23:06.118
crying about her duo.
That's what... is wrong.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.654

23:07.654 --> 23:10.059

the group right now, right?

23:10.059 --> 23:12.497
Oh.
All the other kids are
in there doing the group.

23:12.497 --> 23:16.138
You're on the team, aren't you?
The team's in there dancing.

23:16.138 --> 23:18.175
Why are you coming to her
instead of Gianna?

23:18.175 --> 23:20.547
Why is this okay?!
I didn't know...

23:20.547 --> 23:21.682
Why is she bawling
and it's okay?

23:21.682 --> 23:25.657
If this was me, Ashlee‐‐
even you, possibly,

23:25.657 --> 23:26.959

23:26.959 --> 23:28.262
Which I think is funny,

23:28.262 --> 23:30.567
'cause JoJo's platform
is anti‐bullying,

23:30.567 --> 23:32.571
and she has nothing
but bullied me

23:32.571 --> 23:33.740
since I walked in the door.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.146
Well, I don't think Jess
is a bully.

23:37.146 --> 23:38.315
I don't want to say that.

23:38.315 --> 23:39.450
I feel like she's
been a bully to me,

23:39.450 --> 23:41.354
because she's
been a bitch to me

23:41.354 --> 23:42.423
since the day I walked in here.

23:42.423 --> 23:43.626
I mean, she stood in front of me
and said,

23:43.626 --> 23:44.427
"Your kid's not marketable,

23:44.427 --> 23:45.730
"has no personality,

23:45.730 --> 23:46.899
can only stick her leg
in the air."

23:46.899 --> 23:48.168
If it was just me and her
in a room,

23:48.168 --> 23:49.505
I probably would've...

23:49.505 --> 23:51.408
knocked her out.
Honestly.

23:51.408 --> 23:54.080
<i>Jess leaving like this</i>

could benefit from that.

would ever be a prima ballerina.

26:29.223 --> 26:31.327
No, no. That's not her goal.

26:31.327 --> 26:33.398

Nothing.

the kids.

31:05.710 --> 31:07.012
They're a
crisis center.

31:07.012 --> 31:08.749
Well, I actually was a
Teen Line listener myself

31:08.749 --> 31:10.753
a very long time ago,
but now I'm a therapist,

31:10.753 --> 31:13.191
and I work at Teen Line,
uh, with Ginger.

31:13.191 --> 31:16.030
And... so, we do...
I do a lot of education,

31:16.030 --> 31:19.136
prevention, decreasing stigma,
talking to parents.

31:19.136 --> 31:22.175
Mostly, the people
who call in are between...

31:22.175 --> 31:24.614
Yeah.
I think 15, I think,
is our most common age.

31:24.614 --> 31:25.816

But we get,
definitely...

31:25.816 --> 31:26.985
Right here.
That's you guys.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.087
That's your age.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.924
We know suicide's the
second‐leading cause

31:29.924 --> 31:32.295
of death
from ten‐to‐24‐year‐olds.

31:32.295 --> 31:33.932
And we're finding,

31:33.932 --> 31:35.468
I mean, if you're
reading the news

31:35.468 --> 31:37.372
or anything, that we're finding
a lot of this stuff is starting

31:37.372 --> 31:39.109
younger and younger.

31:39.109 --> 31:40.513
GINGER:
So, I struggled
with depression

31:40.513 --> 31:41.882
a lot in my life.

31:41.882 --> 31:44.253
From a really, really, young age
I started dealing with it.

31:44.253 --> 31:47.192
It got pretty bad when
I was probably 11 or 12

31:47.192 --> 31:49.998
when I was going to a really
hard school academically

31:49.998 --> 31:51.768
with really awful girls.

31:51.768 --> 31:53.505
And, um, I
started having

31:53.505 --> 31:55.141
suicidal thoughts
the next year.

31:55.141 --> 31:57.814
I didn't get out of bed
for probably two weeks.

31:57.814 --> 31:59.784
But I felt like I
physically couldn't talk.

31:59.784 --> 32:03.391
But then I found
a fantastic therapist

32:03.391 --> 32:05.161
and I started training
at Teen Line.

32:05.161 --> 32:06.998
And I got medication,
and I started talking

32:06.998 --> 32:10.038
to my friends and not feeling
ashamed of it anymore.

32:10.038 --> 32:12.743
KALANI:
<i>I hope that us doing this group</i>
<i>dance can help spread awareness</i>

32:12.743 --> 32:17.252
to all the teens out there that
you can call this teen hotline

32:17.252 --> 32:19.189
<i>if you're feeling unsafe</i>
<i>and unprotected.</i>

32:19.189 --> 32:21.293
<i>I think it's a good dance</i>
<i>to spread awareness about.</i>

32:21.293 --> 32:22.897
JILL:
How do you see signs?

32:22.897 --> 32:24.032
CHERYL:
Some of the signs,
I would say,

32:24.032 --> 32:25.468
is definitely a
personality change

32:25.468 --> 32:26.504
of someone who's acting

32:26.504 --> 32:28.441
differently than the way
they used to.

32:28.441 --> 32:31.280
And it's hard with teens because
teens act differently every day.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.019
What's, like, the best
advice that you would give

32:34.019 --> 32:35.054
to someone like that?

32:35.054 --> 32:36.257
I had a caller once

32:36.257 --> 32:37.359
who was an 18‐year‐old boy,

32:37.359 --> 32:40.966
and I picked
up the phone,

32:40.966 --> 32:42.168
and he was crying
and crying and crying.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.170
And I said, "What's wrong?

32:43.170 --> 32:44.339
What's going on?"

32:44.339 --> 32:46.176
And he just said,
"I've never felt so much

32:46.176 --> 32:48.414
"pain in my whole life.

32:48.414 --> 32:50.251
"And you picking up the phone
means more to me

32:50.251 --> 32:52.055
than anything else
I've ever done."
KENDALL: Aw.

32:52.055 --> 32:53.491
He didn't need

32:53.491 --> 32:55.395
anything from me.

32:55.395 --> 32:57.465
He‐he felt pain
and he wanted someone to know

32:57.465 --> 32:59.637
that he felt pain 'cause
he couldn't tell anyone else.

We did it!

It was so good.
We did really good.

44:10.043 --> 44:13.216
We are very proud of ourselves
for pulling off this duet.

44:13.216 --> 44:16.289
<i>I mean, I may have fallen once</i>
<i>or twice in the dressing room,</i>

44:16.289 --> 44:19.428

and we did it.

Let's go.

44:20.598 --> 44:22.501

Yeah.

You guys were so great!

44:29.749 --> 44:31.753
I'm so proud
of all of you.

44:31.753 --> 44:33.122
Oh...

44:33.122 --> 44:34.425
It was the best ever.

44:34.425 --> 44:36.863
It was... it was so good.

44:36.863 --> 44:41.205
It was so nice to see
that type of a dance.

44:41.205 --> 44:43.844
It's‐it's that precision
and that...

44:43.844 --> 44:45.080
You looked like
synchronized swimmers.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.415
Like, it was...
Yes!

44:46.415 --> 44:47.618
It was tight
and it was good

44:47.618 --> 44:48.654
and it was different

44:48.654 --> 44:50.090
and you looked beautiful
when you came out.

44:50.090 --> 44:50.958
And you...

44:50.958 --> 44:52.895
You... you‐you did the...

44:52.895 --> 44:54.766
you did it.
You were long and lean

44:54.766 --> 44:55.768
and it looked good

44:55.768 --> 44:57.104
and I thought the lifts...

44:57.104 --> 44:58.239
I mean, you make them look easy.

44:58.239 --> 44:59.274
That's what you want
to do onstage.

44:59.274 --> 45:01.580
You don't want it
to be this struggle.

45:01.580 --> 45:03.550
I wouldn't have changed anything
in their duet.

45:03.550 --> 45:05.788
They had enough time
and it was fine.

45:05.788 --> 45:07.692
Well, I'm proud that
the Abby Lee Dance Company

45:07.692 --> 45:09.328
put two duets onstage

45:09.328 --> 45:11.700
that were so different,

45:11.700 --> 45:13.202
and both dances

45:13.202 --> 45:15.240
were entertaining
to the audience.

45:15.240 --> 45:20.483
Actually, here's my take on that
dance with Kendall and Kalani.

45:20.483 --> 45:22.989
I think Kendall knows
Kalani's got the legs

45:22.989 --> 45:25.961
and the feet and,
you know, the ballet girl.

45:25.961 --> 45:28.567
So she went out there and
she knew she had to match

45:28.567 --> 45:29.836
Kalani's legs and feet

45:29.836 --> 45:31.807
and‐and she did.

45:31.807 --> 45:33.544
So she worked up to that level.

45:33.544 --> 45:35.948
And I think it's great.

45:35.948 --> 45:38.419
So, you're... what you're saying
is you're so glad

45:38.419 --> 45:40.223
JoJo's gone...
I'm not...

45:40.223 --> 45:41.760
...because she wouldn't have
had to work up to that.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.162

45:46.435 --> 45:48.439
STACEY:
<i>So, we're gonna call Chris</i>

45:48.439 --> 45:50.443
so he can kind of, like,
check out your costumes...

45:51.680 --> 45:53.182
Make sure that
you look good.

45:53.182 --> 45:54.652
Make sure that
he approves, but also,

45:54.652 --> 45:56.455
maybe he can give you
a little pep talk.

45:56.455 --> 45:57.457
Cool?

45:57.457 --> 45:58.794
Chris isn't going to be

to make her look that way.

1:00:53.982 --> 1:00:55.953

1:00:55.953 --> 1:00:57.990

1:00:57.990 --> 1:00:59.326

done this dance.

1:00:59.326 --> 1:01:01.698

So, when you don't show up,

1:01:20.335 --> 1:01:22.172
you don't learn.
You don't grow.

1:01:22.172 --> 1:01:23.909

1:01:23.909 --> 1:01:26.347
