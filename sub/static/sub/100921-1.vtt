16:00.890 --> 16:02.754
and below,

16:02.823 --> 16:06.482
so that I may check
that you are intact

16:06.551 --> 16:08.312
as God made you.

16:08.381 --> 16:11.798
We were vouched for back home.

16:11.867 --> 16:14.525
Do you think our virtue
couldn'’t withstand the journey?

16:16.009 --> 16:17.597
Then wash, Melissande.

16:17.666 --> 16:21.566
It seems that you will be
the first to reveal your virtue.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.480
Francis.

16:38.549 --> 16:40.551
There'’s an Englishman
waiting for you.

16:40.620 --> 16:43.174
These tables are no good.
No good at all.

16:43.243 --> 16:45.142
He is from
the Hudson Bay Company.

16:45.211 --> 16:46.453
I gave Lafarge
exact measurements.

16:46.522 --> 16:48.179
A table that
will not tilt or list,

16:48.248 --> 16:50.457
that is all I asked for,
a proper table, but this...

16:50.526 --> 16:52.666
We will deal with the table
at the proper time.

16:52.735 --> 16:54.358
There is a man.
He is wanting to see...

16:54.427 --> 16:55.773
I said not now, Mathilde.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.816
You have ruined my refinement.

17:04.885 --> 17:06.370
Now what will we do?

17:06.439 --> 17:09.166
We don'’t have money
for these refinements, Francis.

17:10.546 --> 17:14.412
It is the floor that is tilt,
not the table.

17:14.481 --> 17:16.380
I advised
against greenwood planks,

17:16.449 --> 17:18.796
but did you heed my advice?
No.

17:18.865 --> 17:21.799
Everything here is poor
and broken and made wrong.

17:21.868 --> 17:23.249
Even this.

17:23.318 --> 17:25.458
-It is no use.
-Oh...

17:26.528 --> 17:28.875
These are unrefined tables

17:28.944 --> 17:31.015
to serve unrefined food

17:31.084 --> 17:33.052
for unrefined men.

17:33.121 --> 17:35.399
That is our business, Francis.

17:36.331 --> 17:38.298
[footsteps approaching]

17:39.851 --> 17:42.440
A minute is a minute
and not five.

17:42.509 --> 17:45.202
My apologies. My husband and I,
we were just...

17:45.271 --> 17:48.377
Discussing refinements.

17:48.446 --> 17:52.588
-Uh, after a room?
-Aye. Two, actually.

17:56.592 --> 17:59.388
He is my equal
and will be treated as such.

17:59.457 --> 18:02.564
I, uh, have the other guests
to consider.

18:02.633 --> 18:06.499
I wish to be civil
in all enterprises,

18:06.568 --> 18:08.811
but I will not be denied
a proper room

18:08.880 --> 18:11.159
for my coequal Yvon.

18:12.056 --> 18:13.989
Though he can speak for himself.

18:14.058 --> 18:15.197
YVON:
Aye. He is deadly

18:15.266 --> 18:16.957
with that book.

18:17.026 --> 18:18.304
I am not his equal in that.

18:18.373 --> 18:19.891
My apologies.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.686
We will ready the rooms.

18:21.755 --> 18:23.619
Thank you.

18:35.183 --> 18:36.977
Mathilde Geffard.

18:37.046 --> 18:38.807
Aye, Mathilde.
I wish to know

18:38.876 --> 18:41.361
about a recent guest
in your inn.

18:42.535 --> 18:45.262
My husband keeps
very careful records

18:45.331 --> 18:46.987
of all the guests.

18:47.056 --> 18:51.371
Well, then, I am looking for
a Mr. Randall Cross.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.443
The name is not
familiar to me. Hmm.

18:54.512 --> 18:56.652
He was an agent
for the Hudson Bay Company.

18:56.721 --> 19:01.140
His correspondents indicate
that he was a guest at your inn.

19:01.209 --> 19:03.556
He describes the food
as adequate.

19:03.625 --> 19:07.422
Though he did have a few words
of praise for the prune tart.

19:08.354 --> 19:10.459
"Exceptional," he wrote.

19:10.528 --> 19:12.910
It can be, on occasion.

19:12.979 --> 19:14.877
We would like to see
the room Mr. Cross stayed in.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.915
Well, first I must check to see
if he was a guest.

19:17.984 --> 19:19.434
-Francis.
-Stay out of this.

19:20.366 --> 19:22.161
Aye, Mr. Cross was a guest.

19:22.230 --> 19:23.955
He stayed in the Rose Suite.

19:24.024 --> 19:25.440
He left us some time ago.

19:25.509 --> 19:27.062
FRANCIS:
I just want to...

19:27.131 --> 19:29.858
-make sure before, uh...
-I am sure.

19:29.927 --> 19:32.792
These men do not have time
for games, Francis.

19:43.699 --> 19:45.253
CHARLES:
What is that?

19:45.322 --> 19:47.289
RENE:
I heard there was a massacre

19:47.358 --> 19:48.670
just outside of town.

19:48.739 --> 19:50.534
-Families killed by Indians.
-Iroquois.

19:50.603 --> 19:52.570
What does that
have to do with us?

19:55.124 --> 19:58.231
I'’m done for, Rene.
I can walk no more.

19:59.405 --> 20:01.372
You will get the drizzles.

20:02.442 --> 20:05.134
Rise and put your legs to it.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.688
I can'’t.

20:06.757 --> 20:07.999
You can'’t?

20:08.068 --> 20:09.311
Or you won'’t?

20:09.380 --> 20:12.314
I can'’t.
My tooth has cankered.

20:13.384 --> 20:16.353
Man does not walk on his teeth.

20:16.422 --> 20:17.837
You will walk!

20:19.597 --> 20:22.324
Or perhaps I shall leave you
and your cankered tooth

20:22.393 --> 20:23.981
to the loup-garou.

20:25.085 --> 20:28.054
A beast you do not wish to meet.

20:28.123 --> 20:30.367
There is no such thing
as the loup-garou.

20:33.473 --> 20:36.718
I have seen its terrible work.

20:38.789 --> 20:41.895
It has the strength of ten men.

20:41.964 --> 20:43.414
It knows murder.

20:43.483 --> 20:45.554
It knows the proper butcher

20:45.623 --> 20:49.006
of a weak rat man
such as yourself.

20:49.075 --> 20:50.456
A bear.

20:50.525 --> 20:52.803
It is not a bear!

20:56.496 --> 20:59.396
But go on, tarry,

20:59.465 --> 21:02.330
and you will find your end
at its jaws

21:02.399 --> 21:05.471
with Monsieur Duquet.

21:06.368 --> 21:07.680
Arise!

21:15.584 --> 21:17.655
MATHILDE:
Uh, Mr. Cross took meals

21:17.724 --> 21:20.209
by himself.
He avoided billiards.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.902
He left an unpaid bill
and a bucket of night soil.

21:22.971 --> 21:24.731
That is what I recall.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.252
Add the balance to my bill and
all and sundry I shall incur.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.944
Is Mr. Cross missing, then?

21:31.013 --> 21:33.257
It'’s been a month
since his last report.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.432
He was a punctual man.

21:35.501 --> 21:39.263
I'’m here to discover his fate.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.782
If I may ask,

21:40.851 --> 21:42.784
why is this called
the Rose Suite?

21:42.853 --> 21:45.752
Uh...

21:49.204 --> 21:51.862
Our dear daughter Veronique

21:51.931 --> 21:53.277
left that for us.

21:53.346 --> 21:57.039
It is all we have left
to remember her bright light

21:57.108 --> 22:00.664
in this now dim world.

22:00.733 --> 22:03.391
-It is a terrible thing
to lose a child.
-Ah, yeah.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.393
May I ask how she passed?

22:05.462 --> 22:07.567
That is not
for your ledger, Hamish.

22:08.672 --> 22:09.949
Yes.

22:10.018 --> 22:11.813
Forgive me.

22:11.882 --> 22:14.747
We would like
to see our rooms now.

22:18.647 --> 22:21.892
Tell me, Monsieur Sel,

22:21.961 --> 22:24.929
what is your impression
of New France?

22:26.310 --> 22:28.968
[short chuckle]
So many trees.

22:30.625 --> 22:34.180
It is the forest of the world.

22:34.249 --> 22:37.666
No one has ever seen its end,
nor will they.

22:38.598 --> 22:41.360
You have not seen paradise

22:41.429 --> 22:45.364
until you have lain eyes
on my Doma.

22:46.572 --> 22:48.608
It is peaceful,

22:48.677 --> 22:51.473
open, unwalled.

22:52.681 --> 22:54.787
Soon it will blot out Wobik.

23:00.448 --> 23:01.828
Come.

23:04.106 --> 23:06.177
I do not wish
to be on this path

23:06.246 --> 23:08.939
when night falls.

23:09.008 --> 23:10.941
[rustling]

23:13.530 --> 23:14.979
Shh.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.948
Is it the beast?

23:18.017 --> 23:20.951
It is not the beast.

23:21.020 --> 23:23.091
It is providence.

23:46.459 --> 23:49.497
And so a spirit...

23:49.566 --> 23:51.878
is born of the spirit
and flesh of flesh,

23:51.947 --> 23:55.468
and so the kingdom of Satan...

23:55.537 --> 23:59.127
is accomplished in this world
and among all nations.

24:05.374 --> 24:07.894
[chitters]

24:19.561 --> 24:21.667
Behold.

24:29.295 --> 24:32.263
HAMISH:
As a representative
of the Hudson'’s Bay Company,

24:32.332 --> 24:35.335
I aim to discover the reason
for Mr. Cross'’ disappearance

24:35.404 --> 24:39.167
so that I may report back
and suggest a course of action.

24:39.236 --> 24:40.617
Now...

24:40.686 --> 24:42.722
I'’ll have what you know
of the time here.

24:42.791 --> 24:44.448
[short chuckle]

24:44.517 --> 24:46.312
First...

24:46.381 --> 24:49.902
another brandy
on the company'’s tab.

24:53.353 --> 24:56.391
It is cut with some base
and poisonous spirit.

24:56.460 --> 24:59.670
Mm.
It agrees just fine.

25:01.569 --> 25:03.571
Another.

25:09.128 --> 25:11.061
And a coin...

25:11.130 --> 25:12.545
for my troubles.

25:30.287 --> 25:31.633
Aye.

25:31.702 --> 25:34.636
I remember your man,

25:34.705 --> 25:37.846
poking about for the company,
as your type do.

25:37.915 --> 25:39.641
He felt strongly of the need

25:39.710 --> 25:41.678
that we should expand
our operation here.

25:41.747 --> 25:45.233
Long way from the bay
to be expanding.

25:45.302 --> 25:48.339
You are in New France,
Mr. Goames.

25:48.408 --> 25:50.169
It'’s bad enough
the English have been allowed

25:50.238 --> 25:52.171
to creep north along
with the Iroquois.

25:52.240 --> 25:55.139
But soon,
the peace will be broken,

25:55.208 --> 25:57.625
and the English
and French will go back

25:57.694 --> 26:00.489
to the way
things have always been.

26:00.559 --> 26:04.010
Throat slitting,
lies and land grabs.

26:04.079 --> 26:07.600
As you may well know,
one does not prosper

26:07.669 --> 26:10.258
to empire with timid strokes,
Captain.

26:10.327 --> 26:12.571
I keep my distance from empire.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.711
That is for others to sort.

26:14.780 --> 26:17.472
I serve the king

26:17.541 --> 26:18.784
and keep the peace

26:18.853 --> 26:20.958
in Wobik for Intendant De Fer.

26:21.027 --> 26:23.064
Then we will speak
to Intendant De Fer.

26:23.133 --> 26:24.341
[laughs]

26:24.410 --> 26:26.861
He prefers to spend his time
in Quebec.

26:26.930 --> 26:28.310
[laughs]

26:28.379 --> 26:31.693
It is my job
to speak to English scum.

26:33.971 --> 26:37.941
Now, who might you serve,
Mr. Goames?

26:44.257 --> 26:46.915
The truth, Captain.

26:46.984 --> 26:50.781
We were told of
the recent tragedy west of town.

26:50.850 --> 26:53.301
The settlers burnt out,
killed by Iroquois.

26:53.370 --> 26:57.029
We saw the bodies
on display by the docks.

26:58.547 --> 27:01.620
It was a small raiding party.
The rest ran off.

27:01.689 --> 27:05.037
You should know the Iroquois
always collect their dead.

27:05.106 --> 27:07.936
And you should know
better than most

27:08.005 --> 27:11.630
that the Iroquois
have animal hearts...

27:11.699 --> 27:14.771
that will pump
until the last drop leaves them,

27:14.840 --> 27:16.911
and then their sons
will take up the cause

27:16.980 --> 27:18.809
and pray to their wicked god

27:18.878 --> 27:20.984
that death finds you.

27:21.053 --> 27:22.917
Now,

27:22.986 --> 27:25.920
that is some witchcraft
I wish to avoid.

27:25.989 --> 27:27.853
[laughs]

27:27.922 --> 27:30.441
We have the Iroquois
well-managed.

27:32.133 --> 27:34.618
[laughing]

27:34.687 --> 27:36.275
Managed?

27:36.344 --> 27:38.657
There is no managing
the Iroquois.

27:38.726 --> 27:40.762
They outnumber you 40 to one.

27:40.831 --> 27:43.144
YVON:
Silent as deer.

27:43.213 --> 27:46.768
You can'’t tell them apart
from the trees.

27:46.837 --> 27:48.149
Seen one gut a trapper

27:48.218 --> 27:50.841
with nothing more
than a flint knife.

27:50.910 --> 27:53.016
Baby on her back, too.

27:55.466 --> 27:58.746
God will not judge me
for hanging those savages!

28:00.195 --> 28:02.922
Go! Go see for yourself
what they have done.

28:04.337 --> 28:06.098
Was Cross there?

28:06.167 --> 28:08.100
[scoffs]
Hey, he could be anywhere.

28:08.169 --> 28:10.274
Then we will have a look,
Captain.

28:12.242 --> 28:14.382
The woods are filled
with the bones

28:14.451 --> 28:16.936
of men like you, Mr. Goames.

28:18.973 --> 28:22.355
The sooner you find your way
out of Wobik, the better.

28:23.598 --> 28:25.289
COOKE:
Captain?

28:30.053 --> 28:32.676
-Elisha Cooke.
-Hamish Goames.

28:32.745 --> 28:35.783
BOUCHARD:
Mr. Goames has come to town
looking for

28:35.852 --> 28:37.163
the Hudson Bay agent
who went missing.

28:37.232 --> 28:39.303
Randall Cross was his name.

28:41.202 --> 28:44.377
The company sent you all the way
out here to find him?

28:44.446 --> 28:47.311
They did.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.556
Perhaps his absence
is merely discretion.

28:50.625 --> 28:52.903
These are French territories.

28:52.972 --> 28:55.216
A fact that I am
reminded of every day.

28:55.285 --> 28:57.874
Mr. Cooke is the barrel king
of Wobik.

28:57.943 --> 29:01.256
You don'’t want to enter into
trade with him, that'’s for sure.

29:01.325 --> 29:03.258
Did you happen
to meet Randall Cross?

29:03.327 --> 29:06.814
Might I just say what a relief
it is to hear your voice?

29:06.883 --> 29:08.885
Uh, it is so good...

29:08.954 --> 29:11.059
to have another Englishman
in town.

29:11.128 --> 29:12.820
I was born in Kirkwall.

29:12.889 --> 29:16.755
E-Even so, our numbers swell.

29:16.824 --> 29:18.273
BOUCHARD:
Hey!

29:18.342 --> 29:20.724
Were it not for your late
French wife and barrels,

29:20.793 --> 29:24.107
you'’d be outside the gate
fending for yourself, Cooke.

29:24.176 --> 29:27.075
I'’d ask you to join us
for a drink, but... [laughs]

29:27.144 --> 29:29.768
I don'’t want to be seen
with so many English.

29:29.837 --> 29:31.770
No.

29:31.839 --> 29:33.944
It would not be wise for you.

29:35.049 --> 29:37.983
Mr. Goames.
Friend.

29:39.743 --> 29:41.918
[footsteps departing]

29:43.126 --> 29:45.404
-[door opens]
-[bell jingles]

29:45.473 --> 29:46.992
HAMISH:
Mmm.

29:47.061 --> 29:48.994
-The crust.
-[door closes]

29:49.063 --> 29:50.581
It'’s exceptional.

29:50.650 --> 29:52.307
Try some, Yvon.

29:56.104 --> 29:58.210
Prunes don'’t agree.

30:02.697 --> 30:04.803
Good day, Mr. Goames.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.288
[footsteps departing]

30:07.357 --> 30:08.703
[door opens]

30:08.772 --> 30:11.016
[indistinct chatter in distance]

30:13.604 --> 30:16.642
I won'’t take my dress off.

30:16.711 --> 30:19.472
Not for her or anyone else.

30:19.541 --> 30:21.716
You will for your husband.

30:21.785 --> 30:23.891
It will be good practice
for you.

30:27.273 --> 30:30.345
What sort of husband
are you hoping for, Delphine?

30:33.797 --> 30:37.214
Kind.
And, uh,

30:37.283 --> 30:39.216
generous.

30:39.285 --> 30:41.667
And you?

30:41.736 --> 30:43.669
Rich.

30:43.738 --> 30:46.534
With a well-appointed house,
which I will run.

30:50.227 --> 30:53.679
But first, we must brave

30:53.748 --> 30:56.371
the long, bony fingers
of Mother Sabrine.

30:57.752 --> 31:00.479
Pray that she doesn'’t
pop it herself.

31:06.243 --> 31:08.349
Come in, ma petite.

31:19.222 --> 31:20.671
SABRINE:
Lie down.

31:25.435 --> 31:27.368
Lay back.

31:31.096 --> 31:33.098
[sighs]

31:33.167 --> 31:35.272
Pray, if you like.

31:36.549 --> 31:39.242
Then think about
your fine husband

31:39.311 --> 31:42.279
and the fine land
you will share with him.

31:42.348 --> 31:44.385
[sighs]

31:44.454 --> 31:46.974
[gasps, sighs]

31:49.528 --> 31:51.564
Is something wrong?

31:53.635 --> 31:55.568
Was the child born alive?

31:57.708 --> 31:59.745
What child?

31:59.814 --> 32:01.574
It is a sin to lie.

32:01.643 --> 32:04.336
Do you think
you are the first girl

32:04.405 --> 32:07.511
to come to me with a secret?

32:07.580 --> 32:09.582
I have seen...

32:09.651 --> 32:11.895
everything, my dear.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.691
Now tell me.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.245
Yes, Mother, there was a child.

32:18.798 --> 32:20.731
Did the child survive?

32:26.599 --> 32:29.154
Please don'’t send me back.
I was young,

32:29.223 --> 32:31.432
and I wish only
to grow New France.

32:31.501 --> 32:33.710
I promise to be a good wife.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.248
Lamb'’s blood.

32:54.317 --> 32:56.871
On your wedding night,

32:56.940 --> 33:00.668
sprinkle this on the bedsheet.

33:00.737 --> 33:02.670
Tell no one.

33:06.536 --> 33:08.469
Yes, Mother.

33:15.648 --> 33:18.134
My Doma!

33:30.422 --> 33:34.253
[sing-songy]:
Mari, Mari,

33:34.322 --> 33:37.912
dame jolie--

33:37.981 --> 33:41.019
the men are here.

33:41.088 --> 33:43.124
Hey, Theo.

33:43.193 --> 33:46.058
Only God points.

33:46.127 --> 33:49.061
Now, where is God?

33:49.130 --> 33:50.994
-Where were you?
-A trip to town

33:51.063 --> 33:53.100
for the men
who will help us build the Doma.

33:53.169 --> 33:54.963
Mm.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.965
[sniffs]

33:57.035 --> 33:58.795
Mm.

33:58.864 --> 34:00.314
Is that all you did?

34:00.383 --> 34:03.317
I have not spilled seed.

34:03.386 --> 34:07.079
Now, I brought a quill pig
and a fine black ram.

34:07.148 --> 34:09.495
-[laughs]
-That is not a gift.

34:09.564 --> 34:12.533
I have another special something

34:12.602 --> 34:14.673
I will bestow on you tonight.

34:14.742 --> 34:16.675
Mm.

34:17.917 --> 34:20.368
What is your name?

34:20.437 --> 34:22.301
Rene Sel.

34:22.370 --> 34:25.787
The weak one-- he will help you
butcher the ram.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.410
I don'’t need help.

34:27.479 --> 34:30.137
You will show him
and you will be pleasant.

34:30.206 --> 34:32.035
He is a stranger to the knife.

34:32.104 --> 34:34.002
No!

34:34.072 --> 34:36.384
He sees you pointing
with your stick.

34:36.453 --> 34:39.732
Well, he will learn
without pointing.

34:44.565 --> 34:47.430
You.
Come with me.

34:53.539 --> 34:56.301
Have you never
seen an Indian before?

34:56.370 --> 34:57.854
Not alive, sir.

34:57.923 --> 34:59.338
Well, her blood is split.

34:59.407 --> 35:01.858
She is Wendat and French
from her father.

35:01.927 --> 35:05.068
We will expand your knowledge
of their kingdoms,

35:05.137 --> 35:08.140
but first, you must learn

35:08.209 --> 35:11.109
the paths of my Doma.

35:11.178 --> 35:12.938
Always stay on the path.

35:13.007 --> 35:15.458
I have cut them
to conform to the grand pattern.

35:15.527 --> 35:17.218
Do you know
of the grand pattern?

35:17.287 --> 35:19.807
-No, sir.
-It will be made clear.

35:19.876 --> 35:21.809
But if you look,

35:21.878 --> 35:23.845
it is all around.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.502
I will stay on the paths.

35:25.571 --> 35:27.055
And do not cross the bog.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.713
There are things in there
you do not wish to meet.

35:29.782 --> 35:33.061
And stay away from the cabin
unless you are invited.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.615
Do I have your word

35:34.684 --> 35:37.065
you will convey these rules
to Monsieur Duquet?

35:37.135 --> 35:39.067
Yes.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.001
Do not deceive me, Monsieur Sel.

35:42.070 --> 35:44.763
I can see through the trees

35:44.832 --> 35:46.937
and around the whole
of the land.

35:47.006 --> 35:49.526
And what I do not see
comes to me in dreams.

35:49.595 --> 35:51.321
I shall make it clear to Duquet.

35:51.390 --> 35:54.911
Now, tell me,

35:54.980 --> 35:57.707
what is the most
important thing?

36:00.330 --> 36:03.057
Blood.
Family.

36:03.126 --> 36:05.301
I have no family.

36:05.370 --> 36:07.303
Well, that'’s not possible.

36:07.372 --> 36:09.305
Just a brother,

36:09.374 --> 36:11.962
but he drowned under river ice.

36:12.031 --> 36:14.758
Well, you must build another
here. Sow anew.

36:37.885 --> 36:40.128
Give me that knife.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.338
You will cut your foot.

36:46.652 --> 36:48.930
I need a word with your father.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.346
He is indisposed.

36:50.415 --> 36:51.795
-[growls]
-[grunts]

36:54.488 --> 36:57.145
You should teach this boy
some manners.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.218
Pointing a knife at a lady.

37:00.287 --> 37:02.944
Is that true?

37:03.013 --> 37:05.740
Huh? Out.

37:05.809 --> 37:08.571
Out.
Everyone, out, out.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.814
-[banging on table]
-Out! Out!

37:12.644 --> 37:15.233
There is a man at the inn.

37:15.302 --> 37:16.993
He is asking after Mr. Cross.

37:17.062 --> 37:19.375
His name is Mr. Hamish Goames.

37:19.444 --> 37:21.480
In what manner is he asking?

37:21.549 --> 37:23.862
He'’s from
the Hudson'’s Bay Company.

37:25.139 --> 37:28.004
Mr. Cooke has already met him.
What else?

37:28.073 --> 37:30.489
And I have kept my ears open,
as you have asked.

37:30.558 --> 37:33.251
I don'’t know what you
and Mr. Cooke are up to,

37:33.320 --> 37:35.598
nor do I care,
but I will have my payment now.

37:35.667 --> 37:39.360
I have no money. It'’s all on
the table with a pair of queens.

37:39.429 --> 37:41.811
Well, get a marker.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.884
I will club your balls
into your belly.

37:45.953 --> 37:49.370
-LAFARGE: Henri, away. Here.
-[coins clinking]

37:54.617 --> 37:56.550
I won'’t be party to any crime.

37:56.619 --> 37:58.276
There is nothing to worry about.

37:58.345 --> 38:00.588
Just tell me
where is this Mr. Goames.

38:02.314 --> 38:04.212
He is searching west of town,

38:04.282 --> 38:07.630
near where those poor families
were killed by the Iroquois.

38:07.699 --> 38:10.288
He is not a man
to come at frontwise.

38:10.357 --> 38:12.635
Go back to your inn...

38:12.704 --> 38:16.017
and sit on that little husband
of yours.

38:17.364 --> 38:19.538
We will be asking for a refund

38:19.607 --> 38:21.022
for those tables
you built for us.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.887
They are coarse
and poorly constructed.

38:23.956 --> 38:27.132
We will not
be taken advantage of.

38:27.201 --> 38:29.307
[Lafarge chuckles]

38:35.451 --> 38:36.900
[gas hissing]

38:40.490 --> 38:43.148
-This ram is not fit to eat.
-[scoffs]

38:43.217 --> 38:44.632
It is fine.

38:44.701 --> 38:47.186
There are good bits in all,
even this ram.

38:47.255 --> 38:49.568
You will have to learn
how to make do here.

38:49.637 --> 38:52.295
Three years is a long time.

38:52.364 --> 38:54.366
I will not serve three years.

38:54.435 --> 38:55.781
Mm.

38:55.850 --> 38:57.473
Then you should have
never left France.

38:57.542 --> 38:59.647
Here.
Give me the knife.

39:00.855 --> 39:02.029
[sighs]

39:08.449 --> 39:10.244
Go on.
Make the heaven cut.

39:10.313 --> 39:12.419
I can'’t.

39:13.385 --> 39:16.526
You will not survive here.

39:20.392 --> 39:21.359
[gasps]

39:21.428 --> 39:24.154
It is a sign of Strendu.

39:25.259 --> 39:26.536
Where did this come from?

39:28.055 --> 39:29.505
What is the matter?

39:38.445 --> 39:39.894
What did you see?

39:39.963 --> 39:43.139
Hurry.

39:43.208 --> 39:46.384
HAMISH:
If Cross was at the scene
of the massacre, he'’s gone now.

39:46.453 --> 39:47.833
YVON:
Maybe.

39:49.387 --> 39:53.114
Would you like a poem
while the potatoes fry?

39:53.183 --> 39:56.083
I will have to see
the settlement for myself.

39:59.086 --> 40:02.089
Then I shall give the trees
verse then.

40:06.990 --> 40:10.269
"I feed a flame within,
which so torments me,

40:10.338 --> 40:13.928
"that it both pains my heart,
and yet contents me;

40:13.997 --> 40:18.208
"'’tis such a pleasing smart,
and I so love it,

40:18.277 --> 40:22.005
"that I'’d rather die
than once remove it.

40:22.074 --> 40:25.940
"Yet he, for whom I grieve,
shall never know it,

40:26.009 --> 40:30.669
"my tongue does not betray,
nor my eyes show it;

40:30.738 --> 40:34.673
"not a sigh,
nor a tear my pain discloses,

40:34.742 --> 40:37.469
"but they fall silently,

40:37.538 --> 40:40.610
like dew on roses."

40:40.679 --> 40:42.336
TREPAGNY:
Give us this day

40:42.405 --> 40:44.890
our super substantial bread.

40:44.959 --> 40:47.341
Remit our debts
and forgive our debtors.

40:47.410 --> 40:51.103
Keep us from temptation
and free us from evil.

40:51.172 --> 40:52.726
For thine is the kingdom,

40:52.795 --> 40:55.522
the power and the glory,

40:55.591 --> 40:57.627
for ever and ever.
Amen.

40:57.696 --> 40:59.595
[quietly]:
Amen.

41:04.807 --> 41:08.431
Perhaps Monsieur Sel
could pass...

41:08.500 --> 41:11.020
the sel.

41:11.089 --> 41:13.919
[chuckles softly]

41:17.820 --> 41:20.995
Was the ram not fit
for the stew?

41:22.203 --> 41:24.205
Spoilt.

41:25.897 --> 41:27.277
Through and through?

41:28.382 --> 41:31.489
MARI:
Yes, it was.

41:36.632 --> 41:38.357
Putrid, it was.

41:38.426 --> 41:40.290
And the hide?

41:43.708 --> 41:45.192
Worms got to it.

41:46.296 --> 41:48.713
A shame.

41:49.886 --> 41:52.751
It would have made nice hinges

41:52.820 --> 41:54.166
for the cabin.

41:54.235 --> 41:56.859
We will see about the hide
tomorrow.

41:56.928 --> 42:00.863
One must not waste
what God has provided.

42:09.941 --> 42:12.564
[singing indistinctly]

42:19.744 --> 42:21.539
She is beautiful.

42:23.610 --> 42:26.474
Find yourself
an Indian wife then.

42:26.544 --> 42:27.959
[sighs]

42:28.028 --> 42:31.341
I will find a wife
back in Paris.

42:31.410 --> 42:33.343
You can'’t leave.

42:33.412 --> 42:35.345
We'’re bound to our word.

42:37.278 --> 42:39.798
My word means nothing.

42:42.698 --> 42:45.114
Trepagny
will hold me responsible.

42:45.183 --> 42:46.391
How can he?

42:46.460 --> 42:48.013
There is nothing here for us,

42:48.082 --> 42:50.878
just trees and bugs
and dead things.

42:50.947 --> 42:54.261
We have been tricked
into serving a mad squatter.

42:56.712 --> 42:58.817
He will hunt you down
if you leave.

43:02.441 --> 43:05.617
Then we shall make a game of it.

43:16.145 --> 43:17.664
[grunts]

43:29.089 --> 43:31.367
Can you hear it?

43:33.438 --> 43:35.820
God in the whirlwind.

43:37.718 --> 43:41.135
He can feel us
trampling his kingdom.

43:41.204 --> 43:42.550
In the waste,

43:42.620 --> 43:45.795
we shall build a divine city.

43:45.864 --> 43:48.246
A settlement
under the banner of heaven.

43:48.315 --> 43:49.799
What, here?

43:49.868 --> 43:52.457
Yes, here.

43:52.526 --> 43:55.771
You will see.

43:56.944 --> 44:00.845
And I will have that tooth.

44:00.914 --> 44:03.330
Monsieur Sel, assist me.

44:04.538 --> 44:06.298
-Assist me!
-Come.

44:06.367 --> 44:09.301
-Come. Come, it'’s better.
-No.

44:09.370 --> 44:11.338
-It'’s better. [grunts]
-No, no, no! No!

44:11.407 --> 44:12.960
-Get off me! No.
-Yes,

44:13.029 --> 44:15.238
-we shall excise the rot
and have you
-No! No! No.

44:15.307 --> 44:17.482
-on your way to productivity.
-No. N...

44:17.551 --> 44:19.484
