WEBVTT

00:06.277 --> 00:09.040
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I WAS IN MY OFFICE.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.112
IT WAS 10:00 ON THE HOUR,
AND I HAPPENED TO SEE THE DATE--

00:11.112 --> 00:13.414
APRIL 29, 2010.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.246
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS IT. WE'RE HERE.

00:15.246 --> 00:18.689
HOW'S IT GOING?
STRUGGLING WITH
THE DECOHERENCE EQUATION.

00:18.689 --> 00:20.591
THE EQUATION? YEAH, YOU--
YOU DO THE MATH.

00:20.591 --> 00:23.023
YOU DO THE NUMBERS TOGETHER,
AND THEN YOU'RE BOTH

00:23.023 --> 00:24.795
PART OF THE EQUATION.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:24.795 --> 00:27.358
KEIKO.
(Olivia) WE HAVE A SHIFT DOWN
AT IMMIGRATION TONIGHT.

00:27.358 --> 00:29.029
I HAVE SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.502
YEAH, ME, TOO. WE'RE HERE NOW.
THIS IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

00:31.502 --> 00:33.364
I WANT TO BE A PART OF
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS BABY.

00:33.364 --> 00:35.806
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING NOW.
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
TO WALK AWAY?

00:35.806 --> 00:38.309
I'M GONNA BE
ON THIS PLANE TOMORROW.

00:38.309 --> 00:41.272
I'M HOPING YOU WILL BE, TOO.
WE RAN THIS GAIT ANALYSIS
ON SIMON CAMPOS

00:41.272 --> 00:44.044
AND ON SUSPECT ZERO.
SIMON CAMPOS IS SUSPECT ZERO.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.147
WHO'S HELLINGER?
(Lita) HELLINGER'S OUR BOSS.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.219
FACE DOWN! ON THE FLOOR!

00:48.219 --> 00:50.781
SIMON CAMPOS--IS HE HERE?

00:50.781 --> 00:52.623
NO, JANIS.

00:52.623 --> 00:54.255
I NEED YOUR HELP.

01:02.393 --> 01:03.794
(Charlie) MOMMY!

01:03.794 --> 01:06.537
MOMMY!

01:06.537 --> 01:07.838
OH, SWEETIE!
(crying)

01:07.838 --> 01:10.841
OH.

01:10.841 --> 01:13.104
IT'S OKAY. DEEP BREATHS.

01:13.104 --> 01:16.177
YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.350
WHAT HAPPENED?
I HAD A BAD DREAM.

01:19.350 --> 01:22.513
YOU DID? IT'S OKAY.

01:22.513 --> 01:24.355
(breathing heavily)

01:24.355 --> 01:26.287
TODAY'S THE DAY.

01:26.287 --> 01:29.089
OH. YEAH.

01:29.089 --> 01:33.524
YEAH.

01:33.524 --> 01:35.526
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:35.526 --> 01:37.528
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

01:37.528 --> 01:40.271
I'M RIGHT HERE.

01:40.271 --> 01:43.674
TODAY'S THE DAY
DADDY'S GONNA DIE.

01:59.790 --> 02:02.193
YOU WORKED
WITH MY SECURITY DETAIL,

02:02.193 --> 02:05.326
SO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
WHEN EVERYONE FINDS OUT

02:05.326 --> 02:07.598
THAT THE MAD SCIENTIST WAS AWAKE
WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD

02:07.598 --> 02:12.132
WAS ASLEEP--
I'LL BE A DEAD MAN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT, SIMON?

02:12.132 --> 02:15.636
I WANT REVENGE.

02:15.636 --> 02:19.139
I WANT TO DESTROY THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE REALLY RESPONSIBLE

02:19.139 --> 02:21.612
FOR THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT.
LOOK, THEY'RE CORNERED NOW.

02:21.612 --> 02:24.475
WE HAVE HELLINGER IN CUSTODY.

02:24.475 --> 02:27.818
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE, MUST KNOW
IT GOES BEYOND ONE PERSON.

02:27.818 --> 02:31.151
I WANT TO GET BACK AT THEM.
AND WHO ARE THEY?

02:31.151 --> 02:34.925
I DON'T KNOW, AND THEY HAD ME
INSTALL A PIECE OF SOFTWARE

02:34.925 --> 02:38.189
INTO THE MAINFRAME
TO MAKE THE ACCELERATOR FIRE

02:38.189 --> 02:41.192
ON OCTOBER 6th.
WE'VE BEEN OVER THAT SYSTEM
A THOUSAND TIMES,

02:41.192 --> 02:42.933
AND WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

02:42.933 --> 02:45.836
WELL, I DESIGNED IT. I'LL FIND
SOMETHING OTHER PEOPLE WON'T.

02:45.836 --> 02:48.699
LET ME BRING YOU
TO THE BUREAU, SIMON.

02:48.699 --> 02:50.201
WE CAN HELP YOU.

02:50.201 --> 02:52.203
I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH THE FBI.

02:52.203 --> 02:54.605
I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH THE CIA CONTACTS.

02:54.605 --> 02:56.477
THOSE PEOPLE WON'T LET ME

02:56.477 --> 02:58.479
ANYWHERE NEAR
THE MAINFRAME AGAIN.

03:00.751 --> 03:03.684
LOOK...

03:03.684 --> 03:06.857
YOU GET ME INTO N.L.A.P.,
I'LL TURN MYSELF IN.

03:06.857 --> 03:10.190
WHY DID YOU START WORKING
FOR THESE PEOPLE

03:10.190 --> 03:12.763
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
I WAS A KID...

03:12.763 --> 03:17.898
TOLD ME I WAS DESTINED
FOR GREATNESS.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.830
I BELIEVED THEM.

03:19.830 --> 03:23.834
(Mark) THAT WAS
A MARATHON NIGHT, BUT WE DID IT.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.507
WE GOT HELLINGER.
YEAH, WE DID IT.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.879
IT'S NOT THE END, THOUGH.
GOT A FULL MORNING

03:28.879 --> 03:33.414
WITH
THE DIGITAL FORENSICS GUYS--
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU GOT A FLIGHT TO CATCH.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.887
HERE.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

03:36.887 --> 03:41.692
THAT, MY FRIEND, IS 15 COVERS
OF "ISLANDS IN THE STREAM."

03:41.692 --> 03:43.223
(laughs)

03:43.223 --> 03:45.926
THERE'S MY MORNING JACKET,
FEIST, THE CONSTANTINES,

03:45.926 --> 03:48.859
SOME BAND FROM CROATIA--
WHEN THE HELL
DID YOU MAKE THIS?

03:48.859 --> 03:51.402
YEAH, I DON'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

03:51.402 --> 03:52.563
(laughs)

03:52.563 --> 03:55.666
DEM, YOU'RE ALIVE.

03:55.666 --> 03:57.738
IN THE FUTURE YOU SAW,
YOU WEREN'T.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.672
GO TO HAWAII. GO BE ALIVE.
ARE YOU KIDDING, MAN?
IT'S D-DAY.

04:01.672 --> 04:04.975
WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.
NO.
THE PLACE IS PACKED WITH CIA,
FBI, NSA. WE'RE COVERED.

04:04.975 --> 04:07.017
MARK.
GO. PICK A VERSION YOU LIKE.

04:07.017 --> 04:10.020
DANCE WITH YOUR BRIDE.

04:10.020 --> 04:12.252
WHAT'S UP?
NOTHING.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.985
EVERYONE GETS COLD FEET,
DEM.

04:14.985 --> 04:16.887
IT'S NOT COLD FEET.

04:16.887 --> 04:20.531
DO YOU LOVE HER?

04:20.531 --> 04:23.494
COME ON.

04:23.494 --> 04:25.996
DO YOU WANT TO MARRY HER?

04:25.996 --> 04:27.968
HELL, YES.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.541
SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

04:30.541 --> 04:32.843
YOU KNOW,

04:32.843 --> 04:36.547
EVEN WITH THE WAY
EVERYTHING WENT DOWN...

04:36.547 --> 04:39.350
EVEN THOUGH I LOST HER...

04:39.350 --> 04:43.283
MARRYING OLIVIA WAS
THE BEST THING I EVER DID.

04:45.816 --> 04:47.318
DON'T BE AFRAID,

04:47.318 --> 04:49.960
ESPECIALLY ON A DAY
LIKE THIS.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.927
(telephone rings)

04:56.927 --> 04:59.630
YOU'LL STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL
TODAY WITH ME, SWEETIE.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.472
(ring, beep)

05:01.472 --> 05:04.505
HELLO?
Hey. It's me, Lloyd.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.507
Hey, Lloyd.
Can I call you back?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.879
UH, NO, THERE'S NO NEED.
I WAS JUST, UM,

05:08.879 --> 05:10.981
I wanted to talk
about tonight.

05:10.981 --> 05:14.685
You know, I really can't
think about that right now.
I-IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

05:14.685 --> 05:17.888
CHARLIE'S HAVING
A REALLY HARD TIME.
WELL, YEAH.

05:17.888 --> 05:22.052
You know, I'd really like
for us to be together.
YOU KNOW, CAN I...
I-I'LL CALL YOU BACK, OKAY?

05:22.052 --> 05:23.924
(beep)

05:23.924 --> 05:26.026
SWEETIE.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.558
(elevator bell dings)

05:27.558 --> 05:30.561
(police radio chatter,
telephone ringing)

05:30.561 --> 05:32.533
WHERE'S DEMETRI?

05:32.533 --> 05:35.035
HE'S TAKING CARE OF SOMETHING
ELSE. WHAT DO WE GOT?

05:35.035 --> 05:38.068
HELLINGER INVESTED BIG
IN DOT-COMS IN THE EARLY '90s,

05:38.068 --> 05:40.841
THEN DUMPED THEM
BEFORE THE CRASH.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.913
HE PUT THOSE EARNINGS
INTO REAL ESTATE.

05:42.913 --> 05:46.947
GOT OUT AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE MARKET?
EVERY TRANSACTION.
HE BOUGHT LOW, SOLD HIGH.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.449
FUTURE-CASTING.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.451
YEAH, LISTEN, THEY USE
THE FLASH-FORWARDS

05:50.451 --> 05:52.523
TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME
OF A PARTICULAR EVENT,

05:52.523 --> 05:55.986
THEN PUT MONEY
ON A SURE THING.
SO WAS THIS
THE BIGGER CONSPIRACY

05:55.986 --> 05:57.988
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
IN HONG KONG?

05:57.988 --> 06:01.892
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE
ECON 101.
IMAGINE HOW YOU COULD
USE THIS TECHNOLOGY.

06:01.892 --> 06:03.734
TO MANIPULATE GEOPOLITICS.

06:03.734 --> 06:05.966
NSA JUST FINISHED UP
WITH HELLINGER.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.999
IT'S BEEN EIGHT HOURS, AND HE
JUST SAID HIS FIRST SIX WORDS...

06:10.771 --> 06:12.903
"I'M ONLY SPEAKING
TO MARK BENFORD."

06:15.876 --> 06:19.910
(door opens)

06:25.716 --> 06:28.088
FINALLY.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.090
WE NEED TO TALK.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.925
DID YOU CAUSE
THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT?

06:34.925 --> 06:36.867
WE ACTUALLY HAVE
SOMETHING MORE PRESSING

06:36.867 --> 06:40.901
THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOU.
DID YOU CAUSE
THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.933
YES, I CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.

06:42.933 --> 06:47.007
BUT THAT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
NOW. WE CAN'T CHANGE THAT.
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

06:47.007 --> 06:50.511
I'VE SEEN TODAY MORE TIMES
THAN I CAN REMEMBER.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.883
AND A LOT OF THOSE DAYS
STARTED WITH ME

06:52.883 --> 06:55.886
SITTING RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.
MAY I?

06:59.850 --> 07:01.421
THIS?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.193
PLEASE.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.656
THANK YOU.

07:06.957 --> 07:12.032
THERE ARE
SO MANY POSSIBILITIES--

07:12.032 --> 07:14.505
DIFFERENT PATHS
THIS DAY COULD TAKE.

07:14.505 --> 07:19.710
I HAVE SEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT
VERSIONS OF THIS MOMENT...

07:19.710 --> 07:24.014
AND THE NEXT ONE
AND THE NEXT ONE.

07:24.014 --> 07:28.679
BUT IN EVERY VERSION
OF THE FUTURE I SAW...

07:28.679 --> 07:31.922
I SAW THIS.

07:33.754 --> 07:38.058
IN THIS ROOM,
YOU WILL LOSE CONTROL.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.990
AND THEN
YOU'LL LOSE EVERYTHING.

07:39.990 --> 07:43.193
YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK ME,
MARK.

07:43.193 --> 07:45.696
YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK ME
BECAUSE YOU REALIZE

07:45.696 --> 07:48.699
YOU WILL NEVER GET
THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS.

07:48.699 --> 07:52.142
AND THEN
AT THE END OF IT ALL,

07:52.142 --> 07:54.805
YOU'LL BE KILLED
IN YOUR OFFICE.

08:04.955 --> 08:06.987
WHEN'S THE NEXT BLACKOUT?

08:06.987 --> 08:10.120
I'VE SEEN HOW THIS GOES,
MARK.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.963
IF YOU KEEP ME IN CUSTODY,
YOU WILL DIE.

08:12.963 --> 08:15.896
I'M SORRY.
YOU DREW ME A PICTURE,

08:15.896 --> 08:18.569
AND NOW YOU WANT ME
TO LET YOU GO?

08:18.569 --> 08:20.571
I KNOW IT SEEMS SELF-SERVING,

08:20.571 --> 08:23.133
BUT PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

08:23.133 --> 08:26.607
THIS--THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.779
TELL ME HOW YOU DID IT

08:28.779 --> 08:31.211
AND HOW TO STOP IT
FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.784
IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN SAVING YOUR OWN LIFE,

08:33.784 --> 08:36.687
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY
TO YOU, AGENT BENFORD.

08:38.949 --> 08:42.022
(whoosh)

08:42.022 --> 08:45.996
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU JUST
TOLD ME WHAT YOUR NEXT MOVE IS.

08:45.996 --> 08:48.128
MIND IF I TAKE THIS?

09:03.313 --> 09:06.747
YOU KNOW WE'RE KICKING CIVILIANS
OUT AT NOON, RIGHT?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.749
YEAH, I WAS JUST
PACKING UP MY STUFF

09:08.749 --> 09:11.021
SO I COULD CARRY ON
WORKING AT HOME.

09:11.021 --> 09:16.126
I'M SORRY. CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?
THAT SYMBOL. WHAT IS IT?

09:16.126 --> 09:17.828
THE TACHYON CONSTANT.

09:17.828 --> 09:19.960
IT'S A THEORETICAL NUMBER
THAT PHYSICISTS HAVE BEEN

09:19.960 --> 09:23.964
TRYING TO CRACK FOR CENTURIES,
SORT OF A HOLY GRAIL THING.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.997
IT WAS ON THESE BLUEPRINTS
THAT DYSON FROST WAS CARRYING.

09:26.997 --> 09:30.170
IT WAS IN THE FORMULA
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.873
WELL, AT 10:00 TONIGHT,
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE VERGE

09:32.873 --> 09:35.045
OF CRACKING
SOMETHING MONUMENTAL.

09:35.045 --> 09:38.979
THAT WOULD CERTAINLY QUALIFY.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL HELP
OR NOT, BUT THERE IT IS AGAIN.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.981
LUCAS HELLINGER DREW THIS.

09:40.981 --> 09:44.054
HE INCLUDED THAT SYMBOL
AS SOMETHING HIS SIDE

09:44.054 --> 09:47.357
IS GONNA DO TODAY. I WANT
TO BEAT HIM TO THE PUNCH.

09:47.357 --> 09:50.020
SO WHAT THE HELL
IS A TACHYON WIPE?

09:50.020 --> 09:52.663
NOTHING.
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

09:52.663 --> 09:54.995
THE TACHYON'S A PARTICLE.
YOU CAN'T WIPE IT.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.698
YOU LITERALLY
CAN'T EVEN TOUCH IT.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.700
(doorbell rings)

10:01.031 --> 10:02.202
HEY.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.204
HEY.
HAPPY FLASH-FORWARD DAY.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.137
I KNOW YOU LOVE THESE.
THEY'RE FOR YOU.

10:07.137 --> 10:11.181
WOW. THANKS.
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.
LIAR.

10:11.181 --> 10:13.914
UM, SERIOUSLY. CHECK IT OUT.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.615
(door creaks)

10:15.615 --> 10:19.119
SO I HAVEN'T PLANNED OUT
EVERYTHING FOR TONIGHT,

10:19.119 --> 10:22.923
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
START WITH SOME WATER POLO.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.925
UH, WE COULD BOB FOR APPLES,

10:24.925 --> 10:28.659
MAYBE FINISH OFF WITH
SOME SCUBA DIVING. (chuckles)

10:30.731 --> 10:32.032
UH...

10:32.032 --> 10:34.064
YEAH. KEIKO.

10:34.064 --> 10:37.137
ARE YOU SURE THAT
YOU'RE OKAY WITH TONIGHT...

10:37.137 --> 10:39.109
WITH US?

10:39.109 --> 10:43.113
SO THE SWEET, SEXY WOMAN
THAT BRINGS ME CUPCAKES...

10:43.113 --> 10:45.776
WORRIED ABOUT A PRETEND GIRL

10:45.776 --> 10:48.248
WHO LIVES HALF A WORLD AWAY?

10:50.981 --> 10:52.122
COME ON.

11:04.795 --> 11:07.137
(woman) KEIKO-SAN...

11:07.137 --> 11:09.139
(speaking Japanese)

11:12.102 --> 11:14.104
(speaking Japanese)

11:16.676 --> 11:18.749
(gasps)

11:33.994 --> 11:35.996
(woman over P.A.)
ATTENTION, TRAVELERS.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.298
YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO GIVE
MONEY TO SOLICITORS.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.971
THE AIRPORT DOES NOT
SPONSOR THEIR ACTIVITIES.

11:40.971 --> 11:43.003
HI.

11:44.074 --> 11:47.237
(gasps) OH, BABY.

11:47.237 --> 11:51.111
I KNEW YOU'D COME.
OH, MY GOD.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.117
SO MY PARENTS
ARE ALREADY AT THE HOTEL,

11:57.117 --> 11:59.850
AND THEY SAID THAT THERE'S
A HOT TUB IN THE ROOM.

11:59.850 --> 12:03.053
DO YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
WE HAD A HOT TUB IN THE ROOM?
YEAH.

12:03.053 --> 12:06.326
YOU READY?
UM...

12:06.326 --> 12:10.000
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?
YEAH.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.301
OKAY.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.035
AHEM.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.466
WHAT'S UP?

12:16.466 --> 12:19.169
I LOVE YOU.

12:19.169 --> 12:21.942
AND, UH,

12:21.942 --> 12:24.875
I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THIS...

12:24.875 --> 12:27.117
A LONG TIME AGO.

12:30.320 --> 12:35.025
IN JANIS' VISION,
SHE WAS... PREGNANT.

12:35.025 --> 12:36.486
MM-HMM.

12:36.486 --> 12:38.488
FOR THAT TO COME TRUE,

12:38.488 --> 12:41.291
IT HAD TO HAPPEN
WHILE SHE WAS IN SOMALIA.

12:41.291 --> 12:44.094
OKAY.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.999
I SLEPT WITH JANIS
SO SHE COULD GET PREGNANT.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.001
WHAT?

12:51.001 --> 12:53.003
I KNOW THAT WAS WRONG.

12:53.003 --> 12:55.145
I JUST--THE FUTURE
WAS HAPPENING, YOU KNOW?

12:55.145 --> 12:57.177
I--MY LIFE WAS ENDING.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.010
ANOTHER LIFE WAS BEGINNING.

13:00.010 --> 13:03.013
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT...

13:03.013 --> 13:06.256
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE,
AND...

13:06.256 --> 13:08.218
IT MADE SENSE AT THE TIME.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.292
W--

13:12.292 --> 13:16.066
EV-EVERYTHING THAT
I'VE BEEN DOING, DEM...

13:17.267 --> 13:19.369
ALL THE--ALL THE LINES
THAT I'VE CROSSED,

13:19.369 --> 13:24.104
THE--I DID EVERYTHING FOR YOU.
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.437
I-IT WAS BECAUSE
I-I BELIEVED THAT...

13:27.437 --> 13:29.139
(exhales deeply)

13:30.841 --> 13:32.983
I BELIEVED
THAT YOU WERE GONNA LIVE

13:32.983 --> 13:36.816
AND THAT WE WERE GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.020
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DIDN'T.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.122
(whispers) I AM SO SORRY.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.594
SO SORRY.

13:44.594 --> 13:48.058
(normal voice) I JUST THOUGHT
THAT OUR LIFE TOGETHER

13:48.058 --> 13:51.061
WAS OVER ON MARCH 15th. THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT. I WAS WRONG.

13:51.061 --> 13:54.264
YOU WERE RIGHT. YOU BELIEVED
THAT WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE.

13:54.264 --> 13:56.266
BUT I WANT TO START OVER.

13:56.266 --> 13:59.539
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.
PLEASE MARRY ME.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.112
PLEASE?

14:02.112 --> 14:04.975
UM...

14:04.975 --> 14:07.447
(sniffles) I'M GONNA, UH...

14:07.447 --> 14:11.151
I'M GONNA GO TO HAWAII
WITH MY PARENTS,

14:11.151 --> 14:14.024
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO COME, DEM.

14:14.024 --> 14:17.157
AND, UH, AFTER THAT...

14:18.989 --> 14:20.991
I DON'T KNOW.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.138
(Aaron) DON'T WORRY, TRACY.
WE MADE IT.

14:28.138 --> 14:30.870
THIS IS WHERE WE WERE
IN OUR FLASH-FORWARD.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.143
(Tracy, weakly) I WAS IN A CAVE.

14:33.143 --> 14:36.106
JERICHO BROUGHT ME HERE.

14:36.106 --> 14:41.912
HONEY, DON'T WORRY.
DON'T TRY TO TALK.
SHE NEEDS A HOSPITAL. I'M NOT
SURE I CAN CARE FOR HER HERE.

14:41.912 --> 14:44.014
HER PULSE IS THREADY.
THEY MADE ME TELL THEM.

14:44.014 --> 14:48.058
TRACY, WE KNOW WHAT WE SAW.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?

14:48.058 --> 14:49.289
(coughing)

14:49.289 --> 14:51.621
TRACY. KHAMIR!

14:51.621 --> 14:53.023
TRACY.

14:53.023 --> 14:55.165
TRACY.

14:55.165 --> 14:56.266
TRACY!

14:58.898 --> 15:01.501
I CROSS-REFERENCED HELLINGER'S
FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

15:01.501 --> 15:03.333
WITH THE WORD "TACHYON."

15:03.333 --> 15:06.236
TACHYON OFFSITE
INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

15:06.236 --> 15:10.110
THEIR OFFICE IS IN ARCADIA.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT HELLINGER MEANT

15:10.110 --> 15:12.412
BY A TACHYON WIPE?
THEY WAREHOUSE DATA.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.545
MAYBE YOU CAN'T WIPE A TACHYON,
BUT DATA'S A WHOLE OTHER STORY.

15:15.545 --> 15:18.989
I'M GOING IN WITH A TEAM.
WHOA, MARK.

15:18.989 --> 15:23.053
YOU SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?
GOING AFTER THE BAD GUYS?
YEAH.

15:23.053 --> 15:27.357
THINK ABOUT IT. HELLINGER HELPS
ORGANIZE A WORLDWIDE BLACKOUT.

15:27.357 --> 15:30.000
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
HE'D BE SLOPPY ENOUGH

15:30.000 --> 15:32.462
TO LEAVE YOU A CLUE LIKE THIS?
MAYBE.

15:32.462 --> 15:34.965
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.
FORGET IT.

15:34.965 --> 15:38.438
WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME. YOU'RE STAYING.
YOU STAY ON HELLINGER.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.611
I'LL SEND A SPECIAL OPS UNIT
TO CHECK IT OUT.

15:41.611 --> 15:44.244
NO. NO, NO, NO. NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
I CAN.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.177
YOU'RE STAYING. I'M NOT
LETTING YOU WALK INTO A TRAP.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.524
SHE'S BARELY MOVING AIR.

15:54.524 --> 15:57.027
TRACY, BREATHE! TRACY!
PLEASE! NO, NO, NO, STOP.

15:57.027 --> 16:00.160
AARON, PLEASE, LET ME WORK.
PLEASE.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.664
YOU.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.437
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU AND YOUR
JERICHO BUDDIES DO TO HER?

16:07.437 --> 16:09.039
AAH!

16:09.039 --> 16:12.302
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME WHY JERICHO
CAME AFTER MY DAUGHTER.

16:12.302 --> 16:15.305
I'M JUST AN INDEPENDENT
CONTRACTOR ON A SECURITY--

16:15.305 --> 16:16.976
AAH!

16:16.976 --> 16:20.010
(grunting)

16:20.010 --> 16:22.612
SHE SAW YOU GUYS
KILLING AN ENTIRE VILLAGE.

16:22.612 --> 16:25.115
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:25.115 --> 16:27.017
AAH! (grunts)

16:27.017 --> 16:30.490
YOU'RE GONNA
TELL ME WHY NOW.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.163
(gasps)
WE WEREN'T KILLING THEM.

16:33.163 --> 16:35.995
SHE SAW AN ENTIRE VILLAGE
FULL OF PEOPLE

16:35.995 --> 16:38.998
PASSED OUT ON THE GROUND.
IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT--

16:38.998 --> 16:40.470
A TEST RUN.

16:40.470 --> 16:43.033
FOR WHAT?

16:43.033 --> 16:44.304
(grunts) AAH!

16:44.304 --> 16:46.106
KEEP TALKING!

16:46.106 --> 16:49.639
THE EXPERIMENT'S RADIUS
WAS 1 KILOMETER.

16:49.639 --> 16:52.782
WE NEEDED TO KNOW
WHY SHE WAS AWAKE.

16:52.782 --> 16:56.446
(grunts)
EXPERIMENT FOR WHAT?

16:56.446 --> 16:58.348
AAH!
FOR WHAT?

16:58.348 --> 17:00.350
FOR THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.427
I HOPE THE CIA GIVES YOU
AN EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

17:07.427 --> 17:11.030
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STOP BY
A HARDWARE STORE,

17:11.030 --> 17:14.734
PICK UP SOME SUPPLIES
ON THE WAY TO N.L.A.P.
BREAKING INTO
A LINEAR ACCELERATOR--

17:14.734 --> 17:17.767
I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED
A LITTLE MORE THAN DUCT TAPE.

17:17.767 --> 17:20.510
(whispers) NOT THAT KIND
OF HARDWARE.
DEM!

17:25.044 --> 17:28.178
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU, JANIS?
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING HERE?

17:28.178 --> 17:30.620
TELL HIM
TO PUT DOWN HIS WEAPON.

17:30.620 --> 17:33.083
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE,
JANIS?!

17:33.083 --> 17:34.324
HE'S MAKING A DEAL.

17:43.393 --> 17:45.735
YOU'RE BRINGING HIM
TO N.L.A.P.?

17:45.735 --> 17:48.268
YOU'RE PLANNING TO LET HIM
TOUCH THAT ACCELERATOR?

17:48.268 --> 17:51.601
HE CAN GIVE US MORE INFORMATION
THAN ANYONE ELSE CAN.

17:51.601 --> 17:54.844
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU RISK HIM USING THAT MACHINE

17:54.844 --> 17:57.377
TO PUT THE WORLD
TO SLEEP AGAIN.
HEY, I DIDN'T USE IT
THE FIRST TIME.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.709
I'M NOT GONNA USE IT
THIS TIME, EITHER.

17:59.709 --> 18:01.481
HEY, HEY, DEM...

18:01.481 --> 18:04.614
THIS IS ABOUT NAILING
THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE BLACKOUT.

18:04.614 --> 18:07.217
THIS IS ABOUT
GETTING THE JOB DONE

18:07.217 --> 18:09.859
THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW.

18:09.859 --> 18:11.861
JANIS, COME ON.

18:11.861 --> 18:14.724
YOU GOT MORE TO WORRY ABOUT
THAN JUST DOING A GOOD JOB.

18:14.724 --> 18:17.697
OKAY, DEM.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.532
I JUST NEED YOU TO PRETEND
LIKE YOU NEVER CAME BY.

18:22.532 --> 18:25.175
JUST LET ME DO THIS.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.209
NO.

18:31.841 --> 18:35.585
AAH! (grunting)

18:35.585 --> 18:38.148
AAH!
(grunts)

18:38.148 --> 18:41.151
(handcuffs clicking)

18:45.595 --> 18:48.198
YOU'RE GONNA
REGRET THIS DECISION

18:48.198 --> 18:52.162
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

18:52.162 --> 18:55.165
(breathing heavily)

19:00.139 --> 19:02.212
(man) We've secured
the Tachyon data center.

19:02.212 --> 19:04.214
All we've got is
a room full of servers.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.216
(beep)
HAS THE DATA BEEN WIPED?

19:06.216 --> 19:08.218
No. It's weird.
I'm getting nothing--

19:08.218 --> 19:09.919
just a blinking cursor.

19:09.919 --> 19:11.681
(thud)

19:11.681 --> 19:13.683
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

19:13.683 --> 19:16.686
I don't know. It sounded like it
was coming from a storeroom.

19:16.686 --> 19:19.729
I THOUGHT
YOU SWEPT THE PLACE.
We did. I'm gonna go
check it out.

19:19.729 --> 19:23.433
We're getting thermal readings
back now.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.836
NO. GET OUT OF THERE.
GET OUT OF THERE, AGENT!

19:26.836 --> 19:30.400
Whoa! Heads up!
Movement on your--
(gunfire)

19:30.400 --> 19:33.503
(man) Watch out--9:00!
(gunfire continues)

19:35.845 --> 19:40.410
GET OUT OF THERE!
(radio frequency whirring)

19:57.897 --> 20:00.630
MARK, WAIT.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.572
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:02.572 --> 20:05.275
THEY OPENED FIRE
ON THREE OF OUR GUYS.

20:05.275 --> 20:07.537
YOU WERE RIGHT.
TACHYON WAS A TRAP.

20:07.537 --> 20:08.838
WHOA. COOL DOWN.

20:08.838 --> 20:11.941
NO, I GOTTA GO TALK TO HIM!
COOL--COOL DOWN.

20:11.941 --> 20:13.583
DON'T WORRY.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.545
I GOT THIS.

20:15.545 --> 20:17.547
I GOT THIS.

20:17.547 --> 20:19.919
DADDY!

20:19.919 --> 20:22.492
OH, HEY, SWEETIE.

20:22.492 --> 20:24.924
(crying)

20:26.596 --> 20:27.897
YOU OKAY?

20:27.897 --> 20:30.430
YEAH. HEY, STAN.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.432
(police radio chatter)

20:32.432 --> 20:34.364
ARE YOU?

20:34.364 --> 20:36.966
YEAH.

20:36.966 --> 20:39.669
IT'S BEEN A SLOW DAY.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.243
BABE, YOU WANT TO GO WAIT
IN DADDY'S OFFICE?

20:46.946 --> 20:50.450
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY JUST
TO BRING HER HERE LIKE THIS.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.722
SHE'S SCARED.

20:52.722 --> 20:55.985
I THINK THE REALITY OF TODAY
AND, YOU KNOW,

20:55.985 --> 21:00.890
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED--
I THINK IT'S REALLY HITTING HER.

21:00.890 --> 21:03.433
SHE JUST NEEDED HER DAD.

21:03.433 --> 21:07.397
I-I REALLY DID NOT KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

21:07.397 --> 21:09.399
I'M GLAD
YOU BROUGHT HER OVER.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.381
HEY, CHARLIE BEAR.

21:24.814 --> 21:27.657
(whispers) CHARLIE.

21:30.019 --> 21:32.021
WHAT'S UP?

21:32.021 --> 21:34.424
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.

21:38.568 --> 21:40.570
COME HERE.

21:51.641 --> 21:54.814
I NEED TO ASK YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME,

21:54.814 --> 21:56.946
SOMETHING REALLY,
REALLY HARD.

21:58.988 --> 22:01.451
DON'T BE AFRAID.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.025
I MEAN,
IT'S OKAY TO BE AFRAID. IT IS.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.998
BUT THAT'S JUST
WHAT HAPPENS AT FIRST.

22:08.998 --> 22:12.061
AFTER THAT, YOU HAVE
TO TELL YOURSELF SOMETHING--

22:12.061 --> 22:14.534
"MY DADDY LOVES ME,

22:14.534 --> 22:17.537
"AND EVERYTHING
WILL BE OKAY,

22:17.537 --> 22:19.909
NO MATTER WHAT."

22:19.909 --> 22:22.842
"MY DADDY LOVES ME."

22:22.842 --> 22:24.644
SO MUCH.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.917
"AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY,
NO MATTER WHAT."

22:32.021 --> 22:34.684
IT'S NOT EASY,
'CAUSE THINGS CAN BE SCARY,

22:34.684 --> 22:38.087
BIGGER THAN US.

22:38.087 --> 22:40.630
BUT WE CAN FIGHT IT.

22:40.630 --> 22:42.762
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.764
I TELL MYSELF,

22:44.764 --> 22:47.867
"CHARLIE LOVES ME,

22:47.867 --> 22:49.869
"AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY

22:49.869 --> 22:51.901
NO MATTER WHAT."

22:51.901 --> 22:54.043
YOU DO?
I DO.

22:54.043 --> 22:57.777
I TELL MYSELF THAT,
AND IT MAKES ME STRONG.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.009
IT MAKES ME BRAVE.

23:00.009 --> 23:03.783
'CAUSE WHEN I SAY THAT...

23:08.057 --> 23:10.420
YOU'RE ALWAYS WITH ME.

23:10.420 --> 23:14.964
AND WHEN I SAY IT?

23:14.964 --> 23:17.066
I'M ALWAYS WITH YOU.

23:17.066 --> 23:19.168
ALWAYS.

23:19.168 --> 23:22.171
(whispering)
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BABY GIRL.

23:24.173 --> 23:26.776
I LOVE YOU WITH EVERYTHING
I'VE GOT.

23:28.938 --> 23:31.781
OH. THANKS, HONEY.

23:37.887 --> 23:41.991
HEY. YOU GO AND BE
WITH MOM, OKAY?

23:41.991 --> 23:43.793
YOU GO AHEAD NOW.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.828
(Simon) YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE.
(Demetri) SHUT UP.

24:27.737 --> 24:31.140
JANIS, THIS GUY HAS BEEN
LYING TO US ABOUT EVERYTHING.

24:31.140 --> 24:34.504
HE WAS WORKING FOR THEM. HE WAS
AWAKE DURING THE BLACKOUT.

24:34.504 --> 24:36.205
HOW THE HELL
DO YOU TRUST THIS GUY?

24:36.205 --> 24:38.878
AFTER ALL THE LYING,

24:38.878 --> 24:40.950
I THINK I'VE REALIZED THAT

24:40.950 --> 24:42.982
YOU JUST GET TO A POINT WHERE
YOU CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

24:45.715 --> 24:47.587
YOU COMING WITH ME?

24:47.587 --> 24:50.259
TO THE FBI?
YEAH.

24:50.259 --> 24:53.162
NO.

24:53.162 --> 24:55.194
TELL 'EM WHERE YOU FOUND HIM.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.797
DON'T LIE FOR ME.

25:05.034 --> 25:06.606
(engine starts)

25:13.212 --> 25:15.044
(tires screech)

25:19.018 --> 25:21.651
THIS N.L.A.P. THING
IS TOTALLY INSANE.

25:21.651 --> 25:23.653
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
YEAH. I KNOW THAT.

25:23.653 --> 25:26.225
IF I HADN'T HAVE SHOWN UP,

25:26.225 --> 25:29.058
YOU WOULD HAVE
GONE THROUGH WITH THIS?
YEAH.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.633
GET IN.

25:38.908 --> 25:41.070
(tires screech)

25:45.144 --> 25:48.618
NO, DYLAN.
DYLAN, WATCH OUT.

25:48.618 --> 25:50.920
I AM WATCHING.

25:50.920 --> 25:54.153
NO, IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH.
I MEAN, BE CAREFUL,

25:54.153 --> 25:56.325
'CAUSE SOMEWHERE IN HERE
IS THE ANSWER

25:56.325 --> 25:58.658
TO A VERY BIG QUESTION.
WHY DID THE 8 DIE?

25:58.658 --> 26:00.029
WHAT?

26:00.029 --> 26:03.833
WHY DID THE 8 DIE?

26:03.833 --> 26:06.065
OH, NO, NO. THAT'S, UM,
THAT'S NOT AN 8.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.137
THAT'S INFINITY.

26:08.137 --> 26:10.339
WHAT'S INFINITY?

26:10.339 --> 26:11.971
UH, WELL,
INFINITY MEANS "FOREVER."

26:11.971 --> 26:16.075
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, IT DOES KIND
OF LOOK LIKE AN 8 ON ITS SIDE.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.078
ALL THE ONES WITH NUMBERS
HAVE TO BE TOGETHER.

26:19.078 --> 26:23.012
NO, DYLAN. JUST PLEASE,
PLEASE, JUST LEAVE THOSE THERE.

26:25.014 --> 26:28.658
IT ALL HAS TO BE
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

26:31.220 --> 26:33.623
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

26:33.623 --> 26:36.025
IT ALL HAS TO BE
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

26:36.025 --> 26:38.998
(Gabriel) DO THE NUMBERS.
YOU DO THE NUMBERS TOGETHER,

26:38.998 --> 26:40.930
AND THEN YOU'RE BOTH PART
OF THE EQUATION.

26:42.872 --> 26:45.034
OKAY, DYLAN, DYLAN, DYLAN.

26:45.034 --> 26:47.677
GO AND GET YOUR COAT.
GO NOW. GO, GO, GO.

26:47.677 --> 26:51.210
(door opens,
telephone ringing in distance)

26:54.083 --> 26:56.345
I HOPE YOUR AGENTS
ARE ALL RIGHT.

26:56.345 --> 26:59.218
IN MOST FUTURES,
THEY SURVIVE.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.220
WHEN'S THE NEXT BLACKOUT?

27:01.220 --> 27:03.392
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE IN A PLACE

27:03.392 --> 27:05.094
WHERE YOU CAN HEAR THIS
RIGHT NOW,

27:05.094 --> 27:07.396
AND I DON'T WANT
TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO,

27:07.396 --> 27:10.830
BUT I GAVE YOU A CHOICE, MARK.
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
WHEN IS THE NEXT BLACKOUT?

27:10.830 --> 27:13.102
I GAVE YOU A CHOICE,
AND YOU CHOSE THE WRONG PATH.

27:13.102 --> 27:16.065
I'M SORRY THE WAY
THIS IS TURNING OUT.

27:16.065 --> 27:18.067
I MEAN IT WHEN I SAY THAT.

27:18.067 --> 27:21.270
BUT THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO TURN THIS BACK AROUND.
SHUT UP! WHEN IS IT?

27:21.270 --> 27:23.943
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE, MARK,
AND I TAKE NO PLEASURE IN THAT.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.846
I REALLY DON'T. I'VE HAD
SO MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU

27:26.846 --> 27:28.978
IN THIS VERY ROOM.
YOU'RE A DECENT MAN.

27:28.978 --> 27:31.751
THIS IS JUST
ALL OVER YOUR HEAD.

27:31.751 --> 27:35.124
WHEN IS THE NEXT BLACKOUT?
(chuckles)

27:35.124 --> 27:37.787
MARK, YOU WORK HARD.

27:37.787 --> 27:39.929
YOU'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT WHAT YOU DO.

27:39.929 --> 27:42.962
BUT DON'T YOU SEE?
ALL OF THIS IS JUST SO FUTILE,

27:42.962 --> 27:44.994
ALL OF IT.
ALL OF IT?

27:44.994 --> 27:46.896
WE CAUGHT YOU.

27:50.299 --> 27:52.401
YOUR FAITH--IT'S ADMIRABLE.

27:52.401 --> 27:55.975
I MEAN, THAT BOARD
IN YOUR OFFICE--

27:55.975 --> 28:00.109
HOW MUCH TIME HAVE YOU
SPENT ON THAT THING?

28:00.109 --> 28:02.051
HOW MUCH TIME HAVE YOU SPENT
JUST LOOKING AT IT,

28:02.051 --> 28:03.983
ALL ON FAITH?

28:03.983 --> 28:07.186
BUT DEEP DOWN, YOU'VE GOTTA KNOW
WHAT THAT BOARD REALLY IS--

28:07.186 --> 28:11.120
TELL ME.
WHAT IS THAT BOARD ABOUT?
IT'S NOTHING BUT A SCRAPBOOK
OF YOUR FAILURES.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.025
TELL ME WHEN
THE NEXT BLACKOUT IS.

28:16.025 --> 28:18.297
(chuckles) A FREED NAZI,

28:18.297 --> 28:21.731
A-A BOTCHED MISSION TO SOMALIA,
SOME MONSTER PAINTINGS,

28:21.731 --> 28:24.003
DEAD BIRDS...
TELL ME.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.976
AND YOU KEEP LOOKING AT IT.
YOU KEEP BELIEVING,

28:26.976 --> 28:29.478
AND YOU KEEP FIGHTING
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

28:29.478 --> 28:32.481
YOU AND THAT BOARD, YOU'RE
MR. STICK-TO-IT. DON'T YOU SEE?

28:32.481 --> 28:34.483
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GONNA DIE,
MARK.

28:34.483 --> 28:37.446
YOU JUST DON'T GIVE UP.
YOU JUST...

28:37.446 --> 28:38.988
(scoffs)

28:42.992 --> 28:45.124
OH, I SWEAR TO GOD, MARK,

28:45.124 --> 28:48.197
I AM GONNA MISS YOU.
(chuckles)

28:48.197 --> 28:50.199
(sighs)

28:50.199 --> 28:53.863
CHARLIE'S GONNA MISS YOU, TOO.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.007
YOU ARE GONNA DIE, MARK.

28:58.007 --> 29:02.041
YOU'RE GONNA DIE,
BUT THERE IS AN UPSIDE.

29:02.041 --> 29:06.075
AND THIS IS GONNA SOUND
A LOT HARSHER THAN IT REALLY IS.

29:06.075 --> 29:09.448
DEEP DOWN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

29:09.448 --> 29:12.521
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.

29:12.521 --> 29:16.125
BUT YOUR DAUGHTER'S GOING TO BE
BETTER OFF WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

29:16.125 --> 29:19.829
(grunting)

29:22.461 --> 29:24.994
(screams)

29:24.994 --> 29:26.765
(grunting)

29:32.241 --> 29:35.174
(grunts) I'M NOT FINISHED!

29:35.174 --> 29:38.908
AAH! LET GO OF ME!

29:38.908 --> 29:41.951
(breathing heavily)

29:41.951 --> 29:44.954
CLEAN YOURSELF UP, PLAYBOY.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.489
(panting)

30:04.073 --> 30:06.535
GET HIM THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

30:06.535 --> 30:09.308
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.942
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE BRINK
OF LOSING CONTROL ALL DAY--

30:12.942 --> 30:14.813
ALL YEAR.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.245
THAT CRAZY SON OF A BITCH--

30:16.245 --> 30:18.317
OUT, NOW.
I DON'T CARE WHAT DAY IT IS.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.250
NO, STAN...
(speaks indistinctly)
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

30:21.250 --> 30:25.094
GET OUT.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS!

30:37.206 --> 30:41.010
WE ARE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN TONIGHT.

30:41.010 --> 30:42.371
I PROMISE.

30:42.371 --> 30:45.614
I WAS JUST REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO A PICNIC.

30:45.614 --> 30:48.077
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
WE GOTTA GET THERE EARLY

30:48.077 --> 30:52.481
AND STAKE OUT SOME GOOD SEATS
FOR THE FIREWORKS.
JUST, THERE'S GONNA BE
2,000 OTHER PEOPLE.

30:52.481 --> 30:54.383
I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU.

30:54.383 --> 30:57.486
HEY. THERE'S NEVER BEEN
A NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT.

30:57.486 --> 31:02.061
I MEAN, IN FOUR HOURS, PEOPLE
ARE LITERALLY GONNA BE DECIDING

31:02.061 --> 31:03.993
WHETHER TO MAKE
THEIR OWN FUTURES HAPPEN.

31:03.993 --> 31:07.266
I WANT TO BE WITNESS TO THAT.
WHY? 'CAUSE YOUR FUTURE
DIDN'T HAPPEN?

31:07.266 --> 31:10.869
OH. WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

31:10.869 --> 31:14.503
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT THE VISIONS LATELY,

31:14.503 --> 31:19.108
AND I'M... I'M WORRIED
MINE MAY HAVE ALREADY STARTED.

31:19.108 --> 31:21.150
YOU'LL BE WITH ME.
(dog barking in distance)

31:21.150 --> 31:23.212
NO, IT WON'T. IT'S NOT.

31:28.988 --> 31:32.321
NOTHING IS GONNA HAPPEN
TO YOU TONIGHT.

31:32.321 --> 31:33.622
I PROMISE.

31:33.622 --> 31:35.894
COME ON.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.998
LET'S GO.

31:38.998 --> 31:42.101
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT THE DROWNING.

31:42.101 --> 31:45.304
IT'S THAT FEELING I HAD,

31:45.304 --> 31:49.108
YOU KNOW,
LIKE I DESERVED IT.

31:50.980 --> 31:53.642
I'VE BEEN KEEPING
A SECRET FROM YOU.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.616
IT'S REALLY STUPID NOW,

31:57.616 --> 32:01.290
BECAUSE WHEN I TELL YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA HATE ME.

32:01.290 --> 32:03.292
COME ON.

32:03.292 --> 32:05.054
GIVE ME SOME CREDIT.

32:05.054 --> 32:07.226
KEIKO.

32:09.058 --> 32:11.000
SHE'S IN LOS ANGELES.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.702
WHAT?

32:13.702 --> 32:18.067
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT.

32:18.067 --> 32:20.069
BUT I JUST...

32:20.069 --> 32:23.012
I WAS AFRAID
YOU'D CHOOSE HER.

32:23.012 --> 32:25.944
NO, JUST...
JUST TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.678
SOME PEOPLE
FROM THE HOSPITAL--

32:29.678 --> 32:32.181
THEY WENT DOWN TO THIS
IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTER

32:32.181 --> 32:34.223
IN LANCASTER.
SHE'S IN--IN JAIL?

32:34.223 --> 32:36.725
NO, IT'S--IT'S JUST
A HOLDING FACILITY.

32:36.725 --> 32:38.727
YOU LET HER STAY IN--
IN JAIL?

32:41.090 --> 32:44.093
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU, BRYCE.
I'M SORRY.

32:44.093 --> 32:47.196
(woman) KEIKO ARAHIDA?

32:47.196 --> 32:49.198
(buzzer)

32:49.198 --> 32:51.070
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

32:51.070 --> 32:53.242
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE
TO SEE YOU.

33:02.051 --> 33:06.285
I NEED A TRANSFER GUARD
AT THE MAIN GATE.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.287
ES LO QUE QUIERES SABER.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.589
(speaking indistinctly
in Spanish)

33:10.589 --> 33:13.222
(telephone rings)

33:17.426 --> 33:19.068
KEIKO!

33:19.068 --> 33:21.330
KEIKO!
OKASAN.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.332
(speaking Japanese)

34:13.051 --> 34:15.053
AARON! AARON!

34:15.053 --> 34:17.556
HER HEART HAS STOPPED!
I NEED YOUR HELP! COME ON!

34:17.556 --> 34:19.588
TRACY!

34:19.588 --> 34:22.431
TRACY! TRACE, NO!

34:22.431 --> 34:24.833
JUST BREATHE.
BREATHE, TRACY. TRACE!

34:24.833 --> 34:27.065
TRACY! OH, NO.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.398
COME ON, SWEETHEART.
COME ON, SWEETHEART.

34:29.398 --> 34:32.301
COME ON!
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.
TRACY, COME ON BACK!

34:32.301 --> 34:34.673
COME BACK TO ME, SWEETHEART.
COME BACK TO ME.

34:34.673 --> 34:37.676
(crowd cheering)

34:43.182 --> 34:45.114
YEAH!

34:45.114 --> 34:47.656
(cheering continues)

34:47.656 --> 34:50.088
(Hellinger) THIS IS
JUST ALL OVER YOUR HEAD.
(grunts)

34:50.088 --> 34:51.560
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.592
(gunshot)

34:53.592 --> 34:57.095
IN EVERY VERSION
OF THE FUTURE I SAW,

34:57.095 --> 34:59.128
I SAW THIS.

34:59.128 --> 35:03.101
THE FORCES OF THE UNIVERSE
ARE MAYBE PUSHING US TOWARDS

35:03.101 --> 35:05.674
THE FUTURES WE HAVE SEEN.
YOU ARE GONNA DIE, MARK.

35:05.674 --> 35:07.706
BUT THERE IS AN UPSIDE.

35:07.706 --> 35:11.640
DEEP DOWN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

35:11.640 --> 35:15.544
YOUR DAUGHTER'S GONNA BE
BETTER OFF WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

35:17.586 --> 35:20.189
UH, EXCUSE ME.

35:20.189 --> 35:22.351
HEY, LOOK,
I DON'T MEAN TO BOTHER YOU,

35:22.351 --> 35:24.593
BUT, UH, IN MY VISION,
I HAD JUST QUIT DRINKING.

35:24.593 --> 35:25.894
AND I, UM,

35:25.894 --> 35:29.258
AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO
MAKE THAT HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.

35:29.258 --> 35:31.760
SEE, I-I SAW YOU, AND YOU--

35:31.760 --> 35:34.333
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU CAN USE THIS.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.335
HERE.

35:42.211 --> 35:43.642
NO.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.775
IT'S OKAY. I DON'T...

35:46.775 --> 35:49.778
(air horn blaring)

35:49.778 --> 35:52.881
(loud cheering)

36:16.705 --> 36:19.208
(crying)

36:25.914 --> 36:29.388
(inhales and exhales deeply)

36:43.572 --> 36:45.904
(Janis) WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

36:47.936 --> 36:50.539
I DON'T KNOW.

36:50.539 --> 36:52.711
I MEAN, I GET WHY YOU DID IT.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.743
IT WORKED.
WE HAVE HELLINGER.

36:54.743 --> 36:58.987
BUT, JANIS,
I WAS SO PISSED OFF AT YOU.

37:00.849 --> 37:03.892
WORKING FOR THE CIA?

37:05.924 --> 37:07.996
SINCE QUANTICO, I...

37:07.996 --> 37:10.929
I FELT LIKE
I LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

37:13.662 --> 37:17.005
IT'S LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO THE HELL YOU WERE.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.510
YOU KNOW,
AND THEN I'M DRIVING AWAY.

37:21.510 --> 37:23.942
I GOT CAMPOS IN THE BACKSEAT.
I'M LOOKING IN THE REARVIEW,

37:23.942 --> 37:26.475
AND I'M THINKING,
GOING TO N.L.A.P.? THIS IS...

37:26.475 --> 37:29.748
IT'S SO LIKE YOU.
I KNOW YOU, JANIS.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.521
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

37:32.521 --> 37:34.783
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
WE'RE DOING TONIGHT,

37:34.783 --> 37:36.885
BUT I... I DO KNOW YOU.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.299
I TOLD ZOEY...

37:50.299 --> 37:52.000
ABOUT THE BABY.

37:52.000 --> 37:52.971
WHAT?

37:52.971 --> 37:55.444
OH, DEM.

37:55.444 --> 37:58.477
YOU KNOW, THERE JUST
COMES A TIME WHEN YOU...

37:58.477 --> 38:00.549
YOU CAN'T LIE ANYMORE,
RIGHT?

38:12.561 --> 38:14.393
AARON, WE NEED TO STOP NOW.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.865
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY!

38:16.865 --> 38:20.769
HER BRAIN HAS BEEN DEPRIVED
OF OXYGEN TOO LONG.
I KNOW WHAT I SAW!

38:20.769 --> 38:23.031
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

38:23.031 --> 38:26.405
WE WERE HERE TOGETHER.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.037
HER HEART HAS STOPPED BEATING.
(crying)

38:29.037 --> 38:31.880
SHE'S GONE. AARON.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.715
LET HER GO.

38:39.047 --> 38:42.891
(sniffles)
I SAW YOU, TRACY.

38:42.891 --> 38:44.853
TRACY.

38:44.853 --> 38:46.054
I SAW YOU.

38:46.054 --> 38:50.328
(crying)

38:50.328 --> 38:52.330
(man) DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES
HAS SWELLED

38:52.330 --> 38:54.863
AS THOUSANDS BEGIN TO PARTY
AS WHAT HAS BEEN SEEN

38:54.863 --> 38:58.006
AS MORE REMINISCENT OF
A NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATION

38:58.006 --> 39:01.810
RATHER THAN WHAT WAS
PROMISED AS A DISASTER.

39:01.810 --> 39:05.013
â™ªâ™ª

39:05.013 --> 39:06.545
(inhales sharply)

39:06.545 --> 39:08.517
(exhales deeply)

39:08.517 --> 39:11.480
I LIKE THE STRING, BUDDY.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.554
THE CHINESE SAY
RED STRING BRINGS LUCK.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.757
THE DUTCH SAY LEAVE ME ALONE.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.929
WELL, MAYBE IN MY VISION,
YOU AND I WERE TALKING

39:20.929 --> 39:23.792
TO EACH OTHER.
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?

39:23.792 --> 39:25.133
NOPE.

39:25.133 --> 39:27.896
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT
WHAT I REMEMBER.

39:27.896 --> 39:29.037
MM.

39:29.037 --> 39:31.039
(cell phone rings)

39:31.039 --> 39:32.871
(ring)

39:32.871 --> 39:34.773
(ring)

39:34.773 --> 39:35.904
(ring)

39:35.904 --> 39:38.076
(beep)
LLOYD?

39:38.076 --> 39:40.449
HEY, I'M SORRY.
I MEANT TO CALL.

39:40.449 --> 39:45.984
I'M AT YOUR HOUSE. WHY HAVEN'T
YOU BEEN ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?
UH, I JUST NEEDED TO GET AWAY.

39:45.984 --> 39:49.888
WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?
UH, NOT FOR A WHILE.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.990
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:51.990 --> 39:55.093
I JUST NEED SOME SPACE, LLOYD.
I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU

39:55.093 --> 39:58.467
AND MARK AND FLASH-FORWARDS
AND ALL OF IT.

39:58.467 --> 40:00.829
I JUST--I NEED TO GET AWAY.
No, Olivia.
Olivia, listen to me.

40:00.829 --> 40:03.872
LOOK, CERTAIN CONDITIONS
HAVE TO BE MET IF I...

40:05.934 --> 40:08.707
AT 10:00 P.M.,
YOU HAVE TO BE HERE WITH ME.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.979
DON'T DO THIS.
DON'T MAKE THIS ABOUT FATE.

40:10.979 --> 40:13.842
Don't make this
about freewill, okay?

40:13.842 --> 40:16.515
I HAVE CHARLIE TO THINK ABOUT.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.987
So I am not gonna be in
that house with you tonight.

40:18.987 --> 40:21.049
I'M SORRY.
(beep)

40:24.122 --> 40:26.995
THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.431
NO.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.963
â™ªâ™ª

40:34.963 --> 40:38.807
YEAH, NO,
I'M SURE IT WAS YOU.

40:38.807 --> 40:40.809
CHEAP SUIT AND THE...

40:40.809 --> 40:43.642
THE BAD BREATH
AND THE DROOPY EYES.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.945
AND I KEPT SAYING, HEY, MAN,
WHY ARE THE EYES SO DROOPY?

40:46.945 --> 40:49.918
(chuckles) THAT'S IT?

40:49.918 --> 40:52.681
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?

40:52.681 --> 40:54.953
(chuckles) SO YOU'RE
ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.686
AM I?

40:57.686 --> 40:59.828
YEAH. YOU'RE FIGHTIN' FATE,

40:59.828 --> 41:01.560
AND IT'S SO SAD, MAN.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.963
'CAUSE IT'S SO OBVIOUS, MAN,
YOU'VE ALREADY LOST.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.035
â™ªâ™ª

41:07.035 --> 41:09.037
UHH!

41:09.037 --> 41:12.671
(woman screaming,
people shouting indistinctly)

41:12.671 --> 41:16.244
â™ªâ™ª

41:22.551 --> 41:24.583
(woman) FIGHT! YEAH!

41:24.583 --> 41:27.586
(indistinct shouting continues)

41:32.691 --> 41:36.094
(cell doors clanking)

41:42.631 --> 41:44.633
(groans)

41:44.633 --> 41:47.606
(Whitley's "More Than Life"
playing)

41:54.683 --> 41:57.115
â™ª A LEAF â™ª

41:57.115 --> 42:00.288
â™ª IN THE BREEZE â™ª

42:00.288 --> 42:06.154
â™ª THE SMOKY MORNING HAZE â™ª

42:06.154 --> 42:07.996
â™ª TO TOUCH â™ª

42:07.996 --> 42:11.630
â™ª SOMETHING REAL â™ª

42:11.630 --> 42:13.702

42:13.702 --> 42:16.204
â™ª YOUR WOUNDS HEAL â™ª

42:16.204 --> 42:19.738
â™ª LIKE THE SUN â™ª

42:19.738 --> 42:22.270
â™ª ON YOUR FACE â™ª

42:22.270 --> 42:24.613
â™ª THE DREAMS â™ª

42:24.613 --> 42:28.777
â™ª OF STARRY NIGHTS â™ª

42:28.777 --> 42:32.781
â™ª AND I â™ª

42:32.781 --> 42:35.323
â™ª I WANT THIS MORE THAN LIFE â™ª
