It's Owen's favorite.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.541
But Owen isn't here.

11:59.791 --> 12:01.833
-Hey, you lot.
-Hello.

12:01.916 --> 12:05.291
-[Hannah] How was it?
-Oh, you know, just a barrel of laughs.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.000
Any chance for a brew?

12:07.083 --> 12:08.583
Yeah, I'll make tea.

12:08.666 --> 12:09.791
[Hannah and Jamie] No!

12:10.458 --> 12:11.791
I'll make it.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.041
Can you, uh…

12:13.125 --> 12:15.541
make sure these two
don't chop their fingers off?

12:18.041 --> 12:19.166
[Jamie] Owen did his best.

Almost no one even remembers how she was
when her mind hadn't gone.

12:23.916 --> 12:24.875
Hate to say it,

12:24.958 --> 12:27.208
but, on some level, it must be a relief.

12:27.958 --> 12:28.875
For Owen, I mean.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.583
Uh, did he, um…

12:32.208 --> 12:33.750
Did he seem relieved?

12:34.500 --> 12:35.333
No.

12:36.041 --> 12:38.916
Didn't seem much of anything.
Shell-shocked.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.291
I'd be relieved, though.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.833
Losing yourself like that.

Good Christ.

12:51.083 --> 12:51.916
Just shoot me.

12:52.416 --> 12:53.541
Put me out my misery.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.875
It's not fair on anyone.

12:56.666 --> 12:58.916
I don't think fairness
comes into it, dear.

-Easy.
-Oh.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.583
You're gonna hurt yourself.

25:48.666 --> 25:51.833
[chuckles nervously]
I'm sorry. I-I… I keep trying to stop.

25:52.416 --> 25:54.208
Look, I know it's been…

25:54.291 --> 25:55.291
it's been a lot.

25:56.416 --> 25:57.958
You always hear that planning a wedding

25:58.041 --> 25:59.833
is one of the most stressful things
you can do.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.666
But you're doing great.

26:03.416 --> 26:05.291
And I just wanted
to give us a night where…

26:05.875 --> 26:07.375
we don't have to talk about any of it.

26:11.875 --> 26:13.708
Uh… Actually…

26:15.166 --> 26:18.208
Eddie, I was thinking
we could just tone it all down.

26:19.000 --> 26:19.833
Maybe just…

26:21.291 --> 26:24.875
I don't know, I don't think
we have to go so… crazy with it.

26:24.958 --> 26:28.166
Y-Yeah, I thought
you wanted a big wedding.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.083
I-I…

26:29.666 --> 26:32.375
If you don't,
that's all perfectly well and fine.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.333
I…

26:33.833 --> 26:35.041
thought I wanted it.

26:35.958 --> 26:36.791
I wanted…

26:37.583 --> 26:38.416
to want it.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.250
But it's just so expensive,

26:42.750 --> 26:43.583
and…

26:44.250 --> 26:45.250
so much…

26:46.041 --> 26:47.250
to organize.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.625
So many people to let down--

26:49.708 --> 26:51.500
Y-Yeah, no, easy. It's dumb.

26:51.583 --> 26:53.375
For a second,
I thought you were gonna say

26:53.458 --> 26:55.333
you didn't wanna get married at all.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.375
Eddie.

27:06.791 --> 27:07.791
I can't.

27:10.208 --> 27:11.333
What did I do?

27:12.166 --> 27:13.583
-Nothing.
-What didn't I do?

27:13.666 --> 27:16.125
-It's not like that.
-Well, then, what's it like, Danielle?

27:23.833 --> 27:24.666
[sighs]

27:25.333 --> 27:26.166
[sniffles]

27:27.250 --> 27:28.083
Thank you.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
[somber music playing]

27:39.875 --> 27:41.041
This makes no sense.

27:41.125 --> 27:43.416
I should have said something sooner.

27:43.500 --> 27:46.458
-Yeah, you think?
-I didn't wanna hurt you… or your mom.

27:47.916 --> 27:48.791
Or your family.

27:50.041 --> 27:52.166
And then it was just what we were doing.

27:52.541 --> 27:54.500
-Jesus Christ--
-I just…

27:55.208 --> 27:56.958
thought I was being selfish.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.791
That I could just stick it out,

27:58.875 --> 28:00.916
and, eventually, I would feel
how I was supposed to.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.166
You didn't wanna hurt me, huh?

28:03.250 --> 28:04.208
And…

28:04.708 --> 28:05.875
I love you.

28:08.666 --> 28:09.791
So much.

28:10.666 --> 28:12.041
Even still.

28:12.125 --> 28:15.041
-It's just not-- I don't--
-Fuck you, Danielle!

28:18.083 --> 28:20.625
How-- W-Why are you doing this to me?

28:21.708 --> 28:22.541
I, um…

28:23.291 --> 28:24.541
I don't-- Eddie…

28:26.708 --> 28:28.000
Okay. Yeah.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.625
-Eddie.
-No, let me go.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.625
-Eddie!
-Let me go.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.916
-I'm sorry!
-Jesus, have you not-- You've done enough!

28:35.250 --> 28:36.958
[Dani, sobbing] I'm sorry.

28:37.041 --> 28:39.375
Eddie! Eddie!

29:11.416 --> 29:13.625
Oh, damn it! Fallen soldier.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.250
Owen, be a hero, pass us a fresh bottle.

29:17.750 --> 29:21.583
[Hannah] Oh, I love a bonfire, I do.
Reminds me of being a little girl again.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.541
Mind you,
I do appreciate the adult beverages.

29:28.916 --> 29:30.625
[Jamie] You know, in the old days…

29:30.833 --> 29:32.333
I mean, the really old days,

29:33.166 --> 29:35.333
they used to build giant bonfires
at this time of year.

29:36.416 --> 29:38.333
And talk about the people they'd lost.

29:39.666 --> 29:42.375
Toss in offerings
to drive away evil spirits.

29:43.250 --> 29:44.875
-Old bones, mostly.
-[Owen] I remember.

29:44.958 --> 29:48.333
[slurring slightly] That's why
they call it a bonfire, isn't it?

29:48.416 --> 29:49.875
As I was sayin',

29:50.583 --> 29:52.333
that's why it's called a bonfire.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.583
From the old English, meaning "bone fire."

29:56.083 --> 29:59.041
Build a pile of old bones
and burn away the shadows.

29:59.583 --> 30:01.000
Because from here on in,

30:01.750 --> 30:02.916
the shadows get deeper…

30:04.083 --> 30:05.333
…the nights get longer.

30:06.375 --> 30:09.250
We're heading into the dark,
and we have to hang onto each other.

30:09.833 --> 30:11.583
So we can only carry so much.

30:14.875 --> 30:16.000
So…

30:16.625 --> 30:18.375
anyone got any old bones to throw?

30:21.875 --> 30:23.583
All right, I'll start.
[sniffs]

30:23.666 --> 30:25.666
[melancholy music playing]

[Hannah sighs]

30:33.041 --> 30:34.166
Rebecca.

30:36.375 --> 30:37.250
Rebecca Jessel.

30:38.958 --> 30:41.000
Oh, my God, it's been almost a year.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.666
A year focused on the wrong person.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.541
But, wherever she is,

30:48.583 --> 30:51.416
she's still worth ten of that man.
I won't say his name.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.958
She was brilliant.

30:54.541 --> 30:55.750
She was beautiful.

30:56.791 --> 30:58.250
And she was punished for it.

30:59.083 --> 31:02.416
I don't know why brilliant young women
are always punished.

31:05.250 --> 31:06.083
Rebecca.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.083
All right, my turn.
[clears throat]

31:15.000 --> 31:16.583
Lord and Lady Wingrave.

31:17.916 --> 31:19.083
Dominic and Charlotte.

31:19.666 --> 31:21.000
They were good people.

31:21.833 --> 31:23.000
Old-fashioned…

31:23.583 --> 31:24.500
kind people.

31:26.291 --> 31:27.583
And their kids really miss them.

31:29.125 --> 31:30.250
Nothing can fix that.

31:31.750 --> 31:32.583
Not ever.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.291
But here's Dani Clayton.

31:35.875 --> 31:39.000
She's a bit of a weirdo,
but she's a lot stronger than she thinks.

31:39.083 --> 31:42.125
And if anyone can bring Miles and Flora
back to themselves,

31:43.041 --> 31:43.875
she can.

31:43.958 --> 31:45.291
I'm glad she's here.

31:46.583 --> 31:47.958
I think they would be too.

31:48.958 --> 31:49.833
[sniffs]

31:56.541 --> 31:57.958
What about you, Poppins?

31:59.250 --> 32:00.083
Um…

32:03.500 --> 32:04.500
No, thank you.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.375
That's all right.

32:11.916 --> 32:13.333
No, you-- you don't have to.

32:14.958 --> 32:15.791
So…

32:16.625 --> 32:17.458
my mom.

32:19.333 --> 32:20.375
Margaret Sharma.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.916
She was 67.

32:26.250 --> 32:29.333
Except sometimes,
by the end, she forgot that.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.833
Called me by my dad's name,
or her brother's.

32:34.958 --> 32:37.208
You know, I tried to pretend

32:37.291 --> 32:39.458
that I didn't know
who I was supposed to be.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.833
They didn't say
any of that at the funeral.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.250
They wouldn't. They just…

32:49.291 --> 32:50.458
…smoothed it over.

32:50.958 --> 32:51.916
Made it nice.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.416
So, they left out all the bad stuff.

32:57.458 --> 32:58.750
And all the good stuff.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.375
They didn't say how funny she was.

33:03.541 --> 33:04.375
How she would…

33:06.000 --> 33:08.250
wink at you
from across the breakfast table.

33:11.208 --> 33:12.625
She had a sweet tooth.

33:13.750 --> 33:14.833
And a dirty laugh.

33:17.708 --> 33:18.833
And she loved me…

33:19.375 --> 33:21.458
so hard…

33:22.166 --> 33:23.083
it hurt.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.125
Sometimes.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.125
No matter what I did.

33:30.125 --> 33:32.625
She was gone long before she died.

33:33.875 --> 33:35.041
And I miss her.

33:38.291 --> 33:39.666
She was my anchor.

33:41.458 --> 33:43.208
And then I suppose she was my…

33:44.416 --> 33:45.250
…burden.

33:48.416 --> 33:49.250
Christ.

33:51.916 --> 33:54.041
She seemed so small,

33:54.833 --> 33:55.708
at the end.

33:57.666 --> 33:58.625
But still so…

34:00.250 --> 34:01.083
…heavy.

34:01.750 --> 34:02.625
And I…

34:03.958 --> 34:05.375
And all I could do was just…

34:05.458 --> 34:07.416
let her hang onto me

34:07.958 --> 34:10.125
until it was time for her to let go.

34:12.416 --> 34:14.041
And soon I'll let her go, too.

Yeah.

40:56.916 --> 40:58.333
Think I'm crazy?

40:59.041 --> 41:01.375
I think you're surprisingly sane,
considering.

41:03.416 --> 41:04.250
[sniffles]

41:04.333 --> 41:05.166
[Jamie] Look…

41:07.541 --> 41:08.958
I know what it feels like…

41:09.583 --> 41:11.583
to feel like you can't find your--

41:17.916 --> 41:19.000
You sure?

41:21.166 --> 41:22.000
Yes.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
[emotional music playing]

41:34.875 --> 41:35.833
[ominous thud]

41:36.458 --> 41:37.291
[terrified gasp]

41:38.833 --> 41:39.833
Okay.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.208
Right. [clears throat]

41:43.291 --> 41:45.291
-So… [awkward chuckle]
-I don't know what to…

41:46.416 --> 41:48.958
-I don't know what to say.
-Just forget about it.

41:49.041 --> 41:50.500
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

41:50.583 --> 41:51.500
I'm sorry, just…

41:53.125 --> 41:55.500
-Jamie.
-You were just telling me.

41:55.583 --> 41:57.708
Literally telling me
that you weren't up for this.

41:58.291 --> 41:59.375
Just…

41:59.458 --> 42:00.416
Let's…

42:00.500 --> 42:01.333
Let's get back.

42:01.416 --> 42:03.625
Uh, another night, maybe.

42:04.583 --> 42:06.541
Another time, maybe.

42:14.250 --> 42:16.625
[storyteller] <i>But what the gardener</i>
<i>didn't yet understand</i>

42:17.333 --> 42:19.208

42:19.291 --> 42:20.958

42:27.833 --> 42:29.833
-[Mrs. O'Mara] Oh, oh, hi, Danielle.
-Oh.

42:30.708 --> 42:34.666
Uh, y-you've not been answering
your phone, so I thought I'd come around.

42:34.750 --> 42:37.041
Oh, I'm sorry, Judy, I, um…

42:37.625 --> 42:39.041
Uh, it's, it's, um…

42:39.541 --> 42:41.500
-It's been a bad time.
-Oh, of course.

42:41.583 --> 42:43.708
Honey, I'm-- I… I'm worried.

42:44.875 --> 42:47.125
People say
you're not taking care of yourself.

42:47.625 --> 42:48.583
You've got to eat.

42:49.666 --> 42:51.041
I brought some lasagna.

42:52.125 --> 42:53.916
-Oh, my favorite.
-Yeah.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.958
-Thanks.
-No. [laughs gently]

42:56.041 --> 42:57.791
I-I brought something else, too. It's…

42:57.875 --> 42:58.708
Um…

42:59.458 --> 43:00.541
I… [stammering]

43:00.625 --> 43:02.291
I think it's silly, sort of, but…

43:02.791 --> 43:04.666
I thought you might like
to have these.

43:04.750 --> 43:05.833
[eerie music playing]

43:08.708 --> 43:09.916
Oh, uh…

43:10.000 --> 43:11.958
No. Judy, I-I'm sorry, but I--

43:12.041 --> 43:14.875
Really? They were in his things
that came back from the hospital and…

43:15.458 --> 43:16.958
I can't stand to look at them.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.666
I couldn't bear to throw them away,
so I thought…

43:21.791 --> 43:23.375
-Please.
-Okay, of course.

43:25.041 --> 43:25.916
Thank you.

43:28.166 --> 43:29.041
Danielle…

43:30.291 --> 43:34.291
I hope you know that you're still
a really important part of this family.

43:34.875 --> 43:37.958
I hope you know that I mean that.
Come here, come on.

43:38.875 --> 43:39.875
Ohh…

43:42.333 --> 43:43.958
Oh, my sweet thing.

43:44.666 --> 43:46.208
[car approaching]

43:50.416 --> 43:53.333
Okay, um, I-I actually have some stuff
I need to get done.

43:53.416 --> 43:55.333
-Oh, sure, of course. Um…
-Yeah.

43:55.416 --> 43:57.750
Please, please come by for dinner,
any night.

43:58.333 --> 43:59.708
-Okay, I will.
-Okay.

44:00.208 --> 44:01.041
Real soon.

44:01.125 --> 44:02.208
Lots of love.

44:02.291 --> 44:04.208
Okay. Uh, bye-bye now.

44:04.291 --> 44:05.500
Bye, sweetheart.

44:06.416 --> 44:08.416
[somber music playing]

44:18.416 --> 44:19.583
Say it with me.

44:20.125 --> 44:22.500
Hannah Grose in Paris.

44:23.083 --> 44:24.666
You and me<i>,</i> while we still can.

44:25.333 --> 44:28.375
[Jamie] So sorry to interrupt,
but I'm turning into a pumpkin.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.833
Come on, Owen, time to go home.

44:30.916 --> 44:32.791
Oh, it's about that time.

44:32.875 --> 44:34.708
Well… [clears throat]

44:37.875 --> 44:39.083
I'll-co-hol you later.

44:40.583 --> 44:41.916
[Hannah] God, even for you.

44:43.458 --> 44:44.291
Drive safe.

44:44.375 --> 44:46.333
[Jamie] I know the road. We'll be fine.

44:49.791 --> 44:50.625
It's all good.

44:53.125 --> 44:54.500
Christ, the state of you.

45:28.875 --> 45:29.791
[Flora] Miss Clayton?

45:39.333 --> 45:41.333
[frightening musical swell]

45:42.208 --> 45:43.333
Miles!

45:59.625 --> 46:00.458
[sniffs]

46:13.125 --> 46:14.250
[Miles] Miss Clayton!

46:17.041 --> 46:17.875
What the he--

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
What the heck are you doing down here?

46:22.375 --> 46:23.916
Fl-Flora had a nightmare.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.375
[Dani sighs]

46:25.458 --> 46:27.458
Okay, let's get you two back to bed.

46:29.333 --> 46:30.208
Not just yet.

46:31.250 --> 46:32.375
I'm quite frightened.

46:33.250 --> 46:34.791
It was a horrible dream.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.583
Well, you should be in bed.

46:37.166 --> 46:38.666
Not now, I won't.

46:44.541 --> 46:45.583
[sighs]

46:46.875 --> 46:47.791
What happened?

46:48.333 --> 46:51.916
There was something horrible
and loud in the wardrobe.

46:52.000 --> 46:52.833
Mm-hm.

46:52.916 --> 46:55.333
Moving from in there to under…

46:56.833 --> 46:57.750
A creature!

46:58.333 --> 46:59.916
A creature under my bed.

47:00.500 --> 47:01.541
And it knew my name.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.166
And it was reaching out,
and it knew my name.

47:04.250 --> 47:06.416
And it said it wanted to do awful things.

47:07.250 --> 47:08.791
And it had bones for hands.

47:11.125 --> 47:12.958
That sounds awful.

47:14.750 --> 47:15.750
It was my mum.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.833
[eerie music playing]

47:19.250 --> 47:20.333
I am so…

47:20.916 --> 47:22.375
sorry, Flora.

47:23.833 --> 47:25.666
That sounds like an awful dream.

47:26.333 --> 47:27.208
Well.

47:28.500 --> 47:30.666
Let's get you two back to bed, okay?

47:32.208 --> 47:33.291
Just a minute.

47:34.166 --> 47:35.541
I don't want to just yet.

47:36.166 --> 47:37.416
I was so scared,

47:37.958 --> 47:39.916
but I'm feeling better already.

47:41.416 --> 47:42.250
Just…

47:43.458 --> 47:44.791
a-a few minutes more.

47:46.291 --> 47:47.458
Just a minute, really.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.166
In-- in fact,

47:50.666 --> 47:52.916
c-could I have a glass of milk?

47:56.166 --> 47:57.291
[Dani] Of course.

48:15.666 --> 48:17.166
[melancholy music playing]

48:36.375 --> 48:37.250
I'm sorry.

48:38.625 --> 48:39.458
No.

48:40.750 --> 48:43.708
It's okay, okay?
There's nothing to be scared of.

48:48.166 --> 48:49.500
-Quite right.
-Yeah.

48:51.750 --> 48:52.625
Good night…

48:53.250 --> 48:54.291
sweet girl.

49:14.666 --> 49:16.750
[ominous music playing]

49:19.333 --> 49:21.916
[sighs] Talk about this in the morning.

50:07.166 --> 50:08.375
[melancholy music plays]

50:09.083 --> 50:10.625
It's just you and me, then.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.333
Hm?

50:25.083 --> 50:26.458
