WEBVTT

00:03.044 --> 00:05.170
- Hi.
- Hi! Hi, Ben.

00:05.338 --> 00:07.506
- Hi.
- We have a bathroom emergency.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.217
- Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
- Okay, uh, before we do...

00:10.385 --> 00:14.596
...uh, are any of Joey's special
romance magazines in there?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.643
- No.
- Okay, all clear.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.645
Thanks, Phoebe.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.399
That's Rachel.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.443
- But whatever.
- Mm-hm.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.155
Could you do me a big favor?

00:31.322 --> 00:34.158
The, uh, dean's office called
and said there was an urgent meeting.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.535
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

00:37.662 --> 00:40.414
- Well, what about Monica?
- Uh, she isn't home.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.585
So it would just be me alone?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.672
- Well, Ben would be there.
- No...

00:49.507 --> 00:50.758
Huh. Um...

00:50.925 --> 00:53.469
- What's the matter?
- Well, uh, you know, it's just, uh...

00:53.636 --> 00:56.764
I've never done that before.
Me and him, alone.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.474
He's not an ex-con.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.851
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

01:01.019 --> 01:03.979
- What do I do with him?
- I don't know, talk to him.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.148
Entertain him. Keep him alive.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.444
- Okay.
- Okay, Ben, come here.

01:10.612 --> 01:14.865
I'm gonna leave you here with
Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

01:15.033 --> 01:16.075
Gonna be okay?

01:16.242 --> 01:18.285
- I think so.
- I wasn't talking to you.

01:57.158 --> 02:00.119
What about the second minister?
I kind of liked him.

02:00.286 --> 02:04.414
- You mean the spitter?
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.251
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veil.

02:08.877 --> 02:11.922
- And the third guy?
- He kept staring at your chest.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.882
Can you blame him?

02:15.301 --> 02:17.845
I don't like the idea of me saying, "I do"...

02:18.096 --> 02:20.180
...while he's thinking, "I'd do it too."

02:22.350 --> 02:25.352
- Well, then we still have a problem.
- With what?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.521
We need someone
to perform our wedding...

02:27.730 --> 02:29.857
...and they're all either
boring or annoying...

02:30.024 --> 02:32.359
...or keep staring at the ladies.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.781
Ooh, you should have one of us do it.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.118
We're getting "married" married,
not "6th-grade" married.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.704
No, it's a real thing.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.833
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.585
I call it!

02:50.628 --> 02:52.629
What? It was my idea!

02:52.797 --> 02:56.133
Thank you very much,
but neither of you is marrying us.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.468
Does calling it not mean
anything anymore?

02:59.637 --> 03:02.139
We're having a legitimate clergy member.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.975
And when I say legitimate, I mean gay...

03:05.226 --> 03:07.811
...and in control of his saliva.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.201
Ben, you know, when, uh...
When you were a baby...

03:22.410 --> 03:24.328
...we'd hang out all the time.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.288
Because I was your daddy's girlfriend.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.624
But you're not anymore.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.503
- No, I'm not.
- Because you guys were on a break...

03:33.671 --> 03:35.839
Hey, we were not on a... Okay.

03:39.427 --> 03:43.096
- When's my daddy coming back?
- Fifty-two minutes.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.270
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

03:50.438 --> 03:53.357
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

03:53.983 --> 03:57.819
- Really? Like how?
- Well, you know, we would, um...

03:57.987 --> 04:00.530
We'd repeat everything the other said...

04:00.698 --> 04:04.326
...or, uh, we'd jump out of closets
to scare each other...

04:04.494 --> 04:08.288
...or, ha, switch the sugar for the salt
so they put salt on their cereal.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.623
That's a good one.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.418
- Yeah, you like that one?
- Yeah, you're funny.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.046
I'm funny?

04:16.214 --> 04:18.048
Oh, thank God.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.007
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.427
Um, you, uh... You take a quarter...

04:22.595 --> 04:24.179
You take a quarter...

04:24.347 --> 04:27.891
...and you blacken the edge, right?

04:28.142 --> 04:31.520
And then you say,
"I bet you can't roll this quarter...

04:31.688 --> 04:34.064
...to your chin without it leaving your face."

04:34.274 --> 04:39.611
And when they do it, they're left with
a line down the center of their face.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.697
Can I do it to you?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.742
Yeah, I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.327
Heh, okay?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.501
So did you, uh,
find anyone to marry you guys yet?

04:54.752 --> 04:57.963
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister called...

04:59.257 --> 05:01.216
...wondering if we're still together.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.554
- We'll never find anybody.
- Then let me do it.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.639
- Joe...
- No, I've been thinking.

05:07.807 --> 05:11.059
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of people.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.813
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.275
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.862
- That is true.
- And the most important thing...

05:22.030 --> 05:25.574
...is it won't be some stranger
who barely knows you.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.369
It'll be me. And I swear,
I'll do a really good job.

05:29.579 --> 05:33.040
Plus, I love you guys
and it would really mean a lot to me.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.376
Might be kind of cool.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.795
- So I can do it?
- Yeah, you can do it.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.047
All right! Okay!

05:42.091 --> 05:44.468
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.011
Wait a minute.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.639
- Internet ministers can still have sex?
- Yeah.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.020
Coming.

06:03.654 --> 06:06.239
I have a bone to pick with you.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.868
- Uh-oh.
- Yes.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.412
Ben learned a little trick.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.460
- Oh, did he pull the old...?
- That's right, that's right.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.631
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

06:22.840 --> 06:25.759
...so the pee goes everywhere.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.971
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.474
You know I hate practical jokes.

06:32.725 --> 06:36.645
They're mean, they're stupid
and I don't want my son learning them.

06:36.813 --> 06:41.274
Oh, come on. Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?

06:41.442 --> 06:42.776
- I was barefoot.
- Oh.

06:44.529 --> 06:48.573
Tell me, the toilet thing is the
only thing you taught him, right?

06:52.703 --> 06:53.745
Yes.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.419
- Hey.
- Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.754
- You got ordained?
- Yeah.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.508
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.178
Our minister.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.306
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

07:13.474 --> 07:16.476
- Yeah.
- Listen, this is just the first draft, so...

07:18.604 --> 07:21.773
"We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

07:22.024 --> 07:25.986
...to celebrate the special love
that Monica and Chandler share.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.946
Huh? Right.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.992
It is a love based on giving and receiving...

07:32.243 --> 07:34.828
...as well as having and sharing.

07:35.037 --> 07:40.208
And the love that they give and have
is shared and received.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.880
And through this having and giving...

07:45.131 --> 07:48.300
...and sharing and receiving...

07:48.634 --> 07:54.055
...we too can share and love and have...

07:54.682 --> 07:56.600
...and receive."

07:59.604 --> 08:01.605
Should we call the spitter?

08:08.654 --> 08:12.324
- Ha! Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.993
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

08:15.703 --> 08:17.954
I was just in the neighborhood...

08:18.122 --> 08:21.750
...and I passed by your building
and thought, "What's up with Carol...

08:21.918 --> 08:23.418
...and sweet little Ben?"

08:24.795 --> 08:27.047
- That's nice. Well, uh, come on in.
- Okay.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.258
Um, I'll make some coffee
and, uh, we can chat.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.344
I'd love that. I would love that.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.972
So, uh... So where is sweet little Ben?

08:37.140 --> 08:38.433
I would love to have a little...

08:42.855 --> 08:43.980
I found him!

08:45.525 --> 08:47.400
Very funny. Come here.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.446
That is exactly why I've come here
to talk to you, okay?

08:51.697 --> 08:54.157
- Rach, you want some sugar?
- Yes, but...

08:54.325 --> 08:55.700
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

08:59.789 --> 09:02.666
No, just some milk would
be good, Carol. Thanks.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.835
Okay. Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

09:06.003 --> 09:09.047
"Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?"

09:09.882 --> 09:11.550
- Don't do that.
- "Don't do that."

09:11.801 --> 09:15.720
- Your dad doesn't like pranks.
- "Your dad doesn't like pranks."

09:15.888 --> 09:18.014
- Oh, damn it.
- "Oh, damn it!"

09:18.182 --> 09:20.517
No! Don't say that.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.394
- Damn it!
- Go back to repeating.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.187
- Damn it!
- Oh, crap.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.606
- "Oh, crap!"
- Oh.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.947
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

09:36.325 --> 09:38.368
Yeah, okay.

09:39.161 --> 09:43.164
"When I think of the love that these
two givers and receivers share...

09:44.041 --> 09:48.336
...I can't help but envy the lifetime
ahead of having and loving...

09:48.504 --> 09:52.841
...and giving..." And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.802
- How about "receiving"?
- Yes!

09:57.972 --> 10:01.766
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

10:01.934 --> 10:06.396
...but one cool thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

10:06.564 --> 10:08.315
...is that it can be about us.

10:08.482 --> 10:12.027
It can be more personal.
You can tell stories about us.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.361
Ooh, ooh.

10:13.529 --> 10:17.699
Uh, okay. Maybe I'll talk about London.
You know, when you two hooked up.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.660
Only I won't say "hooked up"...

10:20.828 --> 10:23.997
...I'll say, "began their beautiful journey...

10:24.165 --> 10:26.666
- There you go.
...by doing it."

10:29.170 --> 10:31.755
- Joe.
- Okay, all right, um...

10:31.922 --> 10:35.634
So, uh... So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

10:35.885 --> 10:39.512
...then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

10:41.057 --> 10:44.309
- Isn't that what happened to you?
- Yeah!

10:46.687 --> 10:49.064
I call that "London style."

10:50.316 --> 10:52.025
That didn't happen with us.

10:52.193 --> 10:56.029
Ooh, but maybe you should say it is,
because "London style" sounds nice.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.238
Yeah.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.366
Okay, uh...

10:59.533 --> 11:04.162
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.372
Ah.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.958
And Chandler was really sweet
and he consoled me...

11:09.210 --> 11:11.878
...and we drank too much.
- Yeah, baby.

11:14.131 --> 11:18.927
I was a gentleman and I walked her
to her hotel room and said good night.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.637
Oh.

11:20.805 --> 11:24.474
- But then, later that night...
- Yeah, baby.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.401
Hey.

11:34.568 --> 11:38.196
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
here in London, huh?

11:39.657 --> 11:43.618
Well, I wasn't exactly
expecting company after...

11:44.370 --> 11:46.121
...9:15.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.331
Is Joey here?

11:48.582 --> 11:53.002
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

11:53.504 --> 11:57.590
So, uh, you're not still upset
about what that guy told you, are you?

11:58.592 --> 11:59.926
Wouldn't you be?

12:00.344 --> 12:04.264
It's been a really emotional time
and you've had a lot to drink...

12:04.473 --> 12:06.182
You have to let that go, okay?

12:06.434 --> 12:09.477
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.563
Really?

12:11.731 --> 12:15.233
You kidding? You're the most
beautiful woman in most rooms...

12:22.783 --> 12:25.744
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
We just made out.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.288
- We're making out?
- Not anymore.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.876
- But we don't do that.
- I know, I thought it would be fun.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.170
How drunk are you?

12:35.337 --> 12:40.467
Enough to know I want to do this.
Not so much that you should feel guilty.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.386
That's the perfect amount.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.437
- You know what's weird?
- What?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.064
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

12:55.232 --> 12:58.777
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.406
- Want to get under the covers?
- Mm-hm.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.783
Okay.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.752
Wow, you are really fast!

13:15.920 --> 13:19.047
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.092
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.471
- At the same time?
- Count of three?

13:26.722 --> 13:29.557
One, two, three.

13:34.313 --> 13:38.233
Well, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectively ruined.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.777
- Eh, we weren't that close anyway.
- Eh.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.865
Joey, Joey, Joey. It's Joey.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.661
Hey.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.372
Hey, Joe. I was just watching a movie...

13:56.544 --> 13:58.795
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.548
No!

14:01.715 --> 14:04.175
It's cool, I'm still with my bridesmaid.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.969
Where are the condoms?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.012
In my bag over there.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.389
Ah.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.061
Uh...

14:15.229 --> 14:16.563
...could you leave me one?

14:19.859 --> 14:20.900
For just you?

14:22.528 --> 14:23.862
Yeah.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.534
All right. There you go, buddy.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.661
Go nuts.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.124
That's what that was?

14:36.292 --> 14:38.710
Can you imagine
if I hadn't left you that last one?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.254
You two might've never gotten together.

14:41.463 --> 14:44.924
Oh, ooh. Can you imagine if I had sent
that hooker up, like I was gonna?

14:46.927 --> 14:49.679
- It's like it was in the stars.
- Hmm.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.347
Yeah, totally meant to be.

14:51.599 --> 14:55.268
Tell him who you originally
wanted to hook up with that night.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.854
- What?
- What?

14:58.355 --> 14:59.647
What?

15:01.734 --> 15:04.402
Who did you originally
want to hook up with?

15:05.696 --> 15:08.156
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

15:08.365 --> 15:12.619
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.

15:12.870 --> 15:17.332
I wanted something stupid
and meaningless. I just wanted sex.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.668
So when I went to your room that night...

15:20.878 --> 15:24.255
...I was actually looking for Joey.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.263
Yeah, baby.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.225
No, baby.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.853
Oh, my God.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.897
You came looking for Joey?

15:41.148 --> 15:45.443
- Were you planning on telling me this?
- No, I didn't think it was important.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.404
It's not important? It's not important?

15:48.656 --> 15:51.783
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.579
No! Do you know how unbelievably
glad I am that Joey wasn't there?

15:56.747 --> 15:58.331
Hey!

15:59.625 --> 16:02.543
I'm a man of the cloth
but I still have feelings.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.757
There's no way you're doing
this wedding now, okay?

16:07.967 --> 16:11.594
What? That's not fair. It's not my fault.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.388
I was with my bridesmaid.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.682
And who's to say I would've said yes?

16:15.891 --> 16:18.059
I mean, I would've said yes.

16:19.436 --> 16:22.355
Look, you are making way
too big a deal out of this.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.232
Everything worked out okay.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.817
It's just weird, okay?

16:26.068 --> 16:30.029
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mental image of you and Monica.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.449
I need... I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.

16:33.617 --> 16:37.161
- Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
- It is to me.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.665
You wanted to sleep with Batman
and settled for Robin.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.715
- This is crazy.
- No, Robin is so gay.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.471
- So now what have we agreed?
- No more pranks.

16:55.639 --> 16:59.267
- What else?
- You and Daddy were not on a break.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.560
Very good.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.066
Rachel, what are you doing here?

17:07.608 --> 17:10.486
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.406
- Your good friend?
- Yeah.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.241
What's her last name?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.119
Carol...

17:19.829 --> 17:21.455
...Lesbian.
- Nice.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.670
By the way, that, uh...
That line down my face...

17:28.213 --> 17:34.135
The line that prompted a student
in my last class of the day to say:

17:34.303 --> 17:36.262
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

17:38.432 --> 17:40.516
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.895
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.938
- Okay?
- Fine. Fine.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.859
Once I taught him that stuff,
he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."

17:50.027 --> 17:52.111
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.741
I'm glad you guys were bonding but...

17:56.950 --> 17:59.077
Look, he doesn't have any siblings.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.621
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

18:01.872 --> 18:05.625
I haven't taught him anything
a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.919
- Crap!
- I gotta go.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.968
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:16.220 --> 18:20.807
You want this scone? It came for me
but it would rather sleep with you.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.851
Nothing even happened.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.688
I just... I don't want you to be upset.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.649
How can I not be upset?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.985
I finally fall in love
with this fantastic woman...

18:33.237 --> 18:35.488
...and it turns out she wanted you first.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.574
Yeah, for like a half an hour one night.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.661
Chandler, she wants you
for the rest of her life.

18:43.372 --> 18:47.208
We look at you and we see you together,
and it just...

18:47.584 --> 18:50.753
It fits, you know?

18:51.171 --> 18:54.590
And you just know
it's gonna last forever.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.512
That's what you should say.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.306
What?

19:04.685 --> 19:07.186
When you're marrying us,
that's what you should say.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.982
Really? I could do it?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.484
I'd love you to do it.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.028
Hey.

19:18.740 --> 19:22.952
But those are the words.
Those exact words.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.414
Well, I don't remember exactly...

19:27.499 --> 19:33.171
...but it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.510
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.763
- So you guys doing okay?
- Yeah.

19:42.931 --> 19:47.018
We talked and Monica made me see
that I overreacted a little bit.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.480
- Some things are more important.
- Yeah, baby.

19:53.650 --> 19:57.486
I'm really glad you guys are okay,
but I just keep thinking...

19:57.738 --> 20:00.907
...what would've happened
if you two had hooked up.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.828
Honey, dinner's ready!

20:11.793 --> 20:14.253
What's my little chef got for me tonight?

20:14.421 --> 20:16.797
- Your favorite.
- Ho, ho, ho.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.674
Fried stuff with cheese.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.259
Yep.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.969
And lots of it!

20:23.472 --> 20:24.847
Thanks, sweetheart.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.975
Give me a little sugar. Okay.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.478
You wanna go...?

20:30.646 --> 20:32.980
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.111
How you doing?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.203
- Hey.
- Hey!

20:47.454 --> 20:52.083
I'm sorry to do this again,
but could you look after Ben for a bit?

20:52.292 --> 20:53.960
I've got this meeting at school...

20:54.211 --> 20:57.088
...and he asked for his "fun Aunt Rachel."

20:57.714 --> 21:00.091
Well, of course I will watch him.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.301
We have fun, don't we, Ben?

21:03.595 --> 21:06.681
- Okay. See you later, pal.
- Okay.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.977
Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.854
- You got something on your back.
- What?

21:15.357 --> 21:17.191
That's great. That is great.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.819
What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?

21:20.070 --> 21:22.947
"What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?"

21:23.657 --> 21:25.241
That's it! Come here!

21:25.492 --> 21:28.035
- You're in big trouble, young man!
- No, wait.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.413
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!

21:30.664 --> 21:31.914
You guys, hold it. Seriously...

21:33.375 --> 21:34.583
Oh, my God!
