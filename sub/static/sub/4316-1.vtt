You can call yourself Dick Fuck.

All a bit of a blur.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.121
There was hands and hair,

That's horrible.

a TV star and a car chase.

but it's... It's taken me until now

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.887
to realize what real news is.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.681
Real news is supposed
to let people know

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.169
what the powerful are up to, so that
that power doesn't become corrupt.

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.727
But what happens when
the powerful own the news?

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:42.041

Recently, I've been
on a bit of a personal journey.

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.366
I made love to a proud,
intelligent black woman.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.445
I became blind.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.367
I bottle-fed and raised a shark.

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.406
And I smoked a fair amount of crack.

01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:05.289
But the most important thing I've learned
is that there was an emptiness left

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.646
after turning my back on three of the
best friends anyone could ever ask for.

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:19.326

that I still love her.
