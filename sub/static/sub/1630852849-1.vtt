<i>They keep signaling to me</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:43.436

EPISODE 1
SIGNAL

01:56.449 --> 01:58.076
-He's not picking up?
-No.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.705
<i>Sorry. I'm not feeling well.</i>

02:02.789 --> 02:05.291
-<i>I can't make it to the</i> hanbok <i>place.</i>
-What's wrong?

02:06.334 --> 02:08.169
Ki-jun isn't feeling well.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.754
Maybe he's upset.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.215
Upset?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.009
Yesterday…

02:15.635 --> 02:17.262
Did she drag him around?

02:17.345 --> 02:19.264
She did more than that.

02:19.931 --> 02:23.393
She hurt his pride all along.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.312
If I were him, I'd call this wedding off.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.690
I'd be grateful if he did that.

02:28.773 --> 02:29.858
Mom.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.486
It's hard to find
a man like him these days.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.071
He gets his paycheck on time,

02:35.155 --> 02:37.198
and his pension
and retirement are guaranteed.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.242
He's solid.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.912
That's why she's marrying him.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.498
But he's not reliable.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.501
He's not feeling well
because he escorted me yesterday?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.753
I'm almost 70 and I'm not even tired.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.922
You call that solid?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.508
Consider them a match made in heaven.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.720
Mom, they've been together for ten years,
and they never had a fight.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.055
That's what concerns me the most.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.142
She's my daughter,
but I still hate her cranky personality.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.810
How is it possible

03:05.894 --> 03:08.104
that he just bears with it?

03:08.187 --> 03:10.773
It's possible because he likes her.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.401
Fighting requires love.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.070
This looks good.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.531
-The color is very classy.
-It's pretty.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.867
Excuse me.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.704
-Yes, ma'am. This way, please.
-Okay.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.002
<i>As the temperature rises
by more than three degrees,</i>

03:31.085 --> 03:32.587
<i>it will be clear and warm today.</i>

03:32.670 --> 03:35.006
<i>There currently are
many clouds across the country.</i>

03:35.089 --> 03:36.716
<i>But as the sky gradually clears up,</i>

03:36.799 --> 03:40.428
<i>clear weather without a single cloud
will continue for a while.</i>

03:40.511 --> 03:43.181
<i>The air is clean
and the spring sun is warm.</i>

03:43.264 --> 03:45.683
-<i>The temperature in Seoul is 18°C.</i>
-Are we almost there?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.560
<i>-Thanks to the spring breeze,
</i>-What?

03:47.644 --> 03:49.020
<i>the afternoon will be pleasant.</i>

03:49.103 --> 03:51.064
-Turn left up there.
<i>-It would be nice</i>

03:51.147 --> 03:52.899
<i>to have weather like this every day.</i>

03:52.982 --> 03:57.153
<i>As the sunny weather continues,
the air is getting drier.</i>

03:57.237 --> 03:58.655
<i>The use of fire should…</i>

04:06.704 --> 04:08.206
You said we were here for tea.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.124
We are.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.545
-This isn't a teahouse.
-When you're chatting over a cup of tea,

04:14.629 --> 04:16.923
you're at a teahouse.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.182
What brings you here again today?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.893
I'm sure you remember
that I mentioned her before.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.688
-My daughter--
-She's a deaconess.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.523
Deaconesses,

04:33.606 --> 04:37.235
pastors, doctors, professors, mistresses…

04:37.318 --> 04:40.530
Anyone worried and upset
ends up sitting there.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.701
Here.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.415
Both of them were born
in the Year of the Rabbit.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.794
And she was born between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.429
If you're too careful,

05:04.512 --> 05:05.847
life gets difficult.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.727
She was distrustful from a young age.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.938
She always smells water
before she drinks it.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.649
That's because I don't want
to die like Dad. Is that wrong?

05:16.733 --> 05:17.817
Hey.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.069
Mom brought you here for you.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.864
Plus, marital compatibility
is really important.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.991
Then why did you get a divorce?

05:25.074 --> 05:27.577
-Hey.
-Ha-kyung. Don't.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.661
Miss?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.456
You're very cautious.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.875
Yes, she's a little cautious.

05:33.958 --> 05:37.253
Not just a little.
She's morbidly cautious.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.797
But you can't avoid fated relationships

05:39.881 --> 05:42.300
by being cautious.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.392
What is it?

05:51.476 --> 05:54.270
-Her fiance's fortune is…
-What about it?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.982
It shows no "happily ever after"
with his wife.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.485
And his fortune carries atrocity.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.779
He might lose his wife.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.906
-Bereavement?
-Divorce?

06:07.909 --> 06:09.577
I told you

06:09.660 --> 06:12.121
I had a bad feeling about him.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.790
-I'm leaving.
-Ha-kyung.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.208
-She isn't finished.
-Let go.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.209
-Hey!
-I paid good money.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.835
Take that umbrella with you.

06:19.670 --> 06:20.922
Why?

06:23.049 --> 06:24.425
It's going to rain.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.657
Rain, my foot.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.458
SI-WOO

06:57.542 --> 06:59.043
<i>Si</i> as in time and <i>Woo</i> as in rain.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.129
It means rain
that falls at the right time.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.258
So that's why you use this character.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.261
People don't usually use
the character for rain in names.

07:08.344 --> 07:12.223
Oh, right.
My grandfather was a farmer all his life.

07:12.306 --> 07:15.768
He said nothing is more pleasant than
the rain that falls at the right time.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.896
By the way, what do you need a seal for?

07:23.025 --> 07:24.444
For buying a car.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.823

08:01.814 --> 08:03.065

08:17.538 --> 08:18.789
PASSCODE ERROR

08:32.178 --> 08:34.597
What brings you here at this hour?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.140
You said you weren't well. Here.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.185
A cold shower made me feel better.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.353
Did it? Good.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.523
Why did you change the passcode?

08:45.233 --> 08:46.859
Well…

08:47.527 --> 08:49.153
Did my mom come by unannounced again?

08:52.240 --> 08:53.366
Sorry.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.327
-Won't you come in?
-I have to go to work.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.370
I'm running late.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.247
Hold on.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.043
I have to go. Eat the porridge.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.588
<i>Doors opening.</i>

09:08.714 --> 09:10.216
This is Jin Ha-kyung.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.302
<i>Doors closing.</i>

09:19.475 --> 09:21.561
<i>We should report it to the Director.</i>

09:21.644 --> 09:23.229
We were done talking about this.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.731
I said it'll hail today.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.110
There's always damage when it hails.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.988
Even if there's a one percent chance,
we have to analyze it.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.991
So what's the current probability
that you analyzed?

09:36.033 --> 09:37.952
-The probability?
-<i>Yes.</i>

09:39.537 --> 09:41.122
It's almost five percent.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.165
Can you be more exact?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.045
HAIL RADAR

09:49.880 --> 09:52.133
It's between 4.8 to 4.9 percent.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.385
That means it isn't five percent yet.

09:54.468 --> 09:55.803
Well, 4.9 is almost 5.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.055
Call me when it goes over five.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.349
Let's go by the book. I'm hanging up.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.440
Does she think she's the director?

10:15.656 --> 10:17.533
DIRECTOR CHOI JONG-SU

10:51.942 --> 10:53.778
Are you going to work, Reporter Chae?

10:59.325 --> 11:01.369
-Where did you get this car?
-I bought it.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.497
-With what money?
-With a 36-month installment plan.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.459
What are you doing? Get in.

11:09.043 --> 11:09.960
I'm late.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.760
I'm sure the morning forecast
has been released and it's lunchtime soon.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.471
You have to eat, don't you?

11:22.431 --> 11:23.724
Hop in.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.450
Isn't this a new car?

11:42.660 --> 11:43.619
It's slightly used.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.788
Very slightly.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.103
You said you wanted to come here
when we saw it on TV.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.855
What do you think?

12:10.938 --> 12:12.731
Don't I have a good memory?

12:13.441 --> 12:14.442
Yes.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.279
Hey, you're here again.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.285
We'll have the Couple B Set.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.953
Okay. Couple B Set.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.085
-You've been here?
-With a friend.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.921
What a shame.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.174
I wanted to bring you here first.

12:39.508 --> 12:40.801
I mentioned this place so long ago.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.429
Do stuff with me now. I have a car.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.389
What do you want to do?

12:46.515 --> 12:48.184
Well, I don't know.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.313
How about a trip?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.358
It'll be summer soon.
Let's go before we get busier.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.488
The day before yesterday,

13:00.571 --> 13:03.324
I saw a faint sign of hail
on the adiabatic chart.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.325
You know the signs, right?

13:05.576 --> 13:07.119
Snow in mid-March?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.038
So I knew it was going to hail today.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.248
I've been stuck in the office

13:11.332 --> 13:13.501
for three days to find the grounds to…

13:19.215 --> 13:20.216
Right.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.260
You like Gapyeong, right?

13:23.344 --> 13:24.929
I hear there are cute cafés.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.932
How about camping somewhere
with a nice view?

13:28.432 --> 13:31.393
I know the geography
and weather there really well.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.521
I don't like camping.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.274
How about a cottage?

13:42.530 --> 13:43.614
Well…

13:49.995 --> 13:51.080
No way.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.415
It's hail, right?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.251
Yes.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.086
It wasn't in the forecast, right?

13:59.338 --> 14:00.422
They ignored me again.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.416
Yes, sir.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.377
Yes, I'll report it to you.

15:23.881 --> 15:24.965
Goodness.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.969
There was nothing unusual
in the report this morning.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.429
Yes, sir.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.598
We expected that
the atmosphere would be stable

15:32.681 --> 15:35.434
and that the vertical temperature change
would not be severe.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.854
But it became unstable
as the surface temperature rose.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.815
Did you analyze the LWS
and the vertical wind shear data?

15:41.899 --> 15:45.444
-The data did not signal hail.
-Don't you feel guilty?

15:49.156 --> 15:50.741
<i>Not the current data.</i>

15:50.824 --> 15:53.577
<i>Give me the data
from at least 3 to 12 hours ago.</i>

15:55.454 --> 15:56.997
Hey. Isn't it your day off?

15:57.665 --> 15:58.832
You owe me 50,000 won.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.918
I'm in a meeting.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.546
I told you it was going to hail.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.507
If the hail was going to be of that size,

16:06.590 --> 16:08.509
there must have been signals.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.302
How frustrating.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.806
Show me the adiabatic chart for that area.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.349
From six hours ago.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.686

16:39.164 --> 16:40.374
Wait. Right there.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.918
On the bottom. Zoom in.

16:54.805 --> 16:55.806
Isn't that it?

16:57.057 --> 16:59.852
It is. That's a signal.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.145
Right?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.276
He's right.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.281
Right.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.657
"Right"?

17:16.660 --> 17:19.830
When I told you, you said it was nonsense.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.957
Now you see it?

17:22.499 --> 17:24.126
Okay. I'll buy you coffee.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.628
What? Just coffee?

my monthly allowance is?

17:30.966 --> 17:33.761
-Fine. Here.
-All right.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.012
Just buy me coffee.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.806
-Okay. Thanks.
-Sure.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.812
-Leave if you're done.
-Okay.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.564
-Go.
-Well…

17:47.024 --> 17:48.942
Director Choi, did you see this or not?

17:55.616 --> 17:56.533
I did.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.412
But I saw it as a passing phenomenon.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.707
Yes, that's fine.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.086
But you should have at least
mentioned it here somewhere.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.546
-The figures were too--
-I'm sorry, sir.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.007
It was my mistake. I'll write a report.

18:15.385 --> 18:18.347
Tell the Aviation Meteorological Office
it was our mistake

18:19.264 --> 18:21.809
and ask the Expressway Corporation
and Rural Development Administration

18:21.892 --> 18:23.644
if there was any damage to crops.

18:23.727 --> 18:24.686
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.190
A passing phenomenon?

18:28.273 --> 18:31.777
You're missing the signals because you
keep saying meaningless things like that.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.698
Don't just broadcast the weather.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.867
Try to forecast it, okay?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.579
So frustrating.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.876
The reporters are here, sir.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.547
Goodness.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.966
The reporters are here.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.178
Take care of them, Director Choi.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.889
I have to see the Administrator.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.058
My goodness.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.428
In any case,
I clearly told you about the hail.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.763
Please report it to Headquarters later.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.807
What for?

19:43.891 --> 19:46.476
You said the best of the best are there.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.396
I'm one of them.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.690
The best of the best?

19:51.773 --> 19:53.692
Not anymore.

19:53.775 --> 19:54.943
Why is that?

19:55.027 --> 19:59.323
Now, it's more like
a place you go to if you want to suffer.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.449
Yes.

20:04.119 --> 20:07.497
The Director General said
you'd need these for the hail analysis.

20:07.581 --> 20:11.126
These are all similar cases
since the 1990s.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.881
You know that my team
stayed up all night for a week.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.967
Surely the Policy Office can cover for us.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.053
We'd love to,

20:21.136 --> 20:24.973
but the Director General wants
Chief Team Two to report it to him.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.351
We can't analyze this and write a report

20:27.434 --> 20:28.936
while monitoring situations.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.396
-It's…
-When do you need it by?

20:31.480 --> 20:32.522
By this weekend.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.567
Then, good luck.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.277
Hey, Assistant Director Park.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.529
Where's the numerical model I requested?

20:40.656 --> 20:43.242
-It's on the way.
-Quickly, please.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.876
You should do the briefing, Ms. Jin.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.795
If you're sorry.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.381
I don't want to overstep
the Director's authority.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.051
Our administration is
always under fire anyway.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.312
-Director Choi!
-Director Choi!

21:12.396 --> 21:13.689
Oh, no!

21:13.772 --> 21:15.315
-Director Choi!
-Director Choi!

21:15.399 --> 21:17.109
Wake up, Director Choi!

21:17.192 --> 21:19.278
Somebody call an ambulance!

21:19.361 --> 21:20.195
Director Choi!

21:36.962 --> 21:39.047
Is he going to be all right?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.341
-Of course.
-Hold on.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.886
The Office of Spokesperson
is demanding someone to come.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.890
Don't they know Director Choi
was taken away in an ambulance?

21:49.558 --> 21:52.436
-How many is that this year?
-What should we do?

21:52.519 --> 21:54.688
Someone has to attend the briefing.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.864
I'll go.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.558
How is Director Choi?

22:31.641 --> 22:33.518
He was taken away in an ambulance.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.811
We'll see.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.938
Who was that?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.441
A reporter.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.486
She asked me to rearrange
the questions, and I said no.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.654
What do I have to do?

22:44.738 --> 22:47.616
The basic briefing
on the afternoon hail is over,

22:47.699 --> 22:49.242
so just explain the details.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.369
Let's go.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.762
We'll take questions.

23:15.727 --> 23:20.232
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

23:23.360 --> 23:25.237
I'm at the hospital. Yes.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.573
I think he's okay.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.741
Hold on.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.576
-Director Choi.
-We'll move him to his room.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.953
-To his room?
-Yes.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.414
Mrs. Choi. You must be in shock.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.542
You didn't have to come.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.127
Of course I had to come.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.587
-I'm glad it wasn't any worse.
-Glad?

23:44.381 --> 23:45.298
Well…

23:46.258 --> 23:47.843
My husband has been requesting

23:47.926 --> 23:50.428
a position in a regional office for years.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.763
Yes.

23:51.847 --> 23:55.600
The doctor kept telling him to be careful
because of his high blood pressure.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.894
But you kept asking him

23:57.978 --> 24:00.355
to stay for another year
and then another year.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.607
How can you corner him

24:02.691 --> 24:04.359
for missing one occurrence of hail?

24:04.442 --> 24:06.444
It wasn't only because of--

24:06.528 --> 24:08.488
You always get the weather wrong.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.074
Making that one slip is not a big deal.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.244
Do you know what they call you?

24:15.412 --> 24:17.497
-Pardon?
-A human juicer.

24:17.581 --> 24:20.041
Because you extract every ounce
of energy from people.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.796
You know, I'm sick of all this.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.966
Mrs. Choi, I'm really sorry.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.177
Yes. You should go.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.387
-Okay. He'll be fine. I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

24:42.355 --> 24:43.440
You're back.

24:48.111 --> 24:51.072
Director Choi had a heart attack.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.451
That's why he said his chest felt tight.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.619
Did he?

24:56.828 --> 24:58.246
Why didn't I know that?

24:59.539 --> 25:02.042
He's okay now, right?

25:02.125 --> 25:06.171
He'll have a thorough examination.
We'll see. He'll be okay.

25:06.254 --> 25:10.008
Don't stress him out
by visiting him in the hospital, okay?

25:10.091 --> 25:13.470
As for Chief Team Two…

25:16.056 --> 25:17.557
Ms. Jin will be in charge.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.563
I'm getting married next month, sir.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.316
So be in charge
until Director Choi returns.

25:26.816 --> 25:27.943
It'll be two weeks max.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.778
You can cover for him, right?

25:31.529 --> 25:33.907
The position of acting director
might be too much for her.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.951
What? Speak up.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.411
What is it? Do you have a better idea?

25:39.412 --> 25:40.997
-No, sir.
-Okay.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.834
It's decided then.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.582
<i>Why aren't you coming?</i>

26:24.666 --> 26:27.711
I can't go to your alumni dinner tonight.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.297
I have to go alone again?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.258
You know Director Choi is in the hospital.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.394
Okay.

26:44.894 --> 26:47.856
Don't worry about it. Get back to work.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.608
It's only for two weeks.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.193
I'm sorry about this.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.112
Okay.

27:09.627 --> 27:16.634
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

28:01.596 --> 28:02.847
Look at that view.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.230
I need to share this view.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.373
GLOBAL WARMING AND
THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

28:28.456 --> 28:31.668
So it means that
this summer will be hot as usual.

28:31.751 --> 28:32.836
Then it's easy.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.338
"The worst summer ever."

28:35.422 --> 28:36.881
"Record-breaking heatwaves."

28:36.965 --> 28:38.508
"Sauna-like heat."

28:38.591 --> 28:41.344
That's less than five words.
Why make such a long title?

28:41.428 --> 28:44.180
I'm not saying
it's especially hot this summer.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.974
The average temperature will rise

28:46.057 --> 28:47.475
by one to two degrees
due to global warming.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.521
Do you think people
are interested in global warming?

28:51.604 --> 28:52.772
It can be provocative.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.150
So write something
that makes people want to read.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.236
-Hey.
-How many times do I have to say this?

28:58.903 --> 29:01.573
That's how you sell air conditioners.

29:01.656 --> 29:03.450
Don't you know who our biggest sponsor is?

29:04.033 --> 29:05.285
This isn't an ad agency.

29:05.368 --> 29:07.078
Why are we advertising air conditioners?

29:07.162 --> 29:09.080
Because it's good for you, for me,

29:09.164 --> 29:10.707
and for everyone else here.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.126
So please do as you're told.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.295
Let's take home some bonuses.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.464
Please?

29:19.716 --> 29:21.634
You can do it.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.677
Make it provocative.

29:35.231 --> 29:38.526
LEE SI-WOO

29:38.610 --> 29:40.737
-What is this?
<i>-Isn't it awesome?</i>

29:42.906 --> 29:44.324
I'M MAKING A SEAL TODAY
WHY?

29:44.407 --> 29:45.700
LOOK AT THESE VIEWS
THEY'RE NICE

29:49.996 --> 29:52.749
ISN'T IT AWESOME?

29:52.832 --> 29:54.876
<i>Unbelievable! I hit the jackpot today!</i>

29:59.881 --> 30:01.341
<i>I found fairy clouds.</i>

30:02.091 --> 30:05.261
<i>These are hard to find. I'm so lucky.</i>

30:09.349 --> 30:10.600
Is she busy?

30:35.750 --> 30:36.626
Sir!

30:41.548 --> 30:42.590
He's here again.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.219
I give up.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.096
I give up.

30:53.810 --> 30:57.230
See? There's nothing wrong
with the radar antenna.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.357
Why did you come all the way here?

30:59.440 --> 31:02.026
Because I don't trust machines.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.821
Also, I get to see you once in a while.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.242
Are you sure
there's nothing wrong with it?

31:09.325 --> 31:10.285
Yes.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.371
If you're done, you should go. We're busy.

31:13.454 --> 31:14.998
It's only March,

31:15.081 --> 31:18.376
but the temperature here
is abnormally high compared to the inland.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.380
Why don't you talk to the Gangwon Office?

31:26.342 --> 31:27.343
I see.

31:27.427 --> 31:31.097
GANGWON REGIONAL OFFICE
OF METEOROLOGY

31:31.180 --> 31:32.223
Yes, this is Gangneung.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.852
Hello. The ground temperature
in Gangwon is too high.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.061
Please check.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.605
Is that so?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.316
<i>Could you also check</i>

31:41.399 --> 31:42.817
Pyeongchang, Chuncheon,

31:42.901 --> 31:44.777
Hongcheon, Hoengseong, Wonju,

31:44.861 --> 31:46.779
and the whole area please?

31:46.863 --> 31:49.741
Hold on. Pyeongchang.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.702
Chuncheon.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.495
Hongcheon.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.830
And?

31:55.914 --> 31:57.248
Hoengseong and Wonju.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.876
I see. Hoengseong and Wonju. Hold on.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.295
I'm sorry, but could you hurry?

32:02.378 --> 32:04.088
Wonju. Oh, no.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.634
This is Um Dong-han of Gangneung.

32:08.217 --> 32:09.260
What is this about?

32:09.344 --> 32:12.847
Please check the ground temperatures

32:12.931 --> 32:14.557
for Pyeongchang, Chuncheon,

32:14.641 --> 32:16.976
Hongcheon, Hoengseong, and Wonju.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.270
GANGWON PROVINCE

32:19.354 --> 32:22.315
I see. It's a temporary phenomenon
caused by solar radiation

32:22.398 --> 32:24.233
when the east wind blows.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.110
It happens sometimes.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.278
It'll stop.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.447
I don't think it will.

32:29.530 --> 32:30.406
Pardon?

32:32.450 --> 32:34.118
Okay, I understand.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.872
Understand what? Hello?

32:39.624 --> 32:41.751
Who is this jerk?

32:41.834 --> 32:43.836
I didn't ask.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.631
Why didn't you?

32:46.714 --> 32:49.842
That's why we get these rude calls.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.552
I'm sorry, sir.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.554
Darn it.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.269
-Sir.
-Yes?

33:00.353 --> 33:02.689
Did you hear the rumor?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.524
What rumor?

33:04.607 --> 33:06.859
I heard the position
of director of Chief Team Two

33:06.943 --> 33:08.277
at Headquarters is vacant.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.114
So what?

33:11.197 --> 33:13.616
You should go back to Headquarters.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.493
No, thanks.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.453
That place gives me headaches.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.498
-I wouldn't go even if they begged me.
-What?

33:20.581 --> 33:22.250
If you're away for too long,

33:22.333 --> 33:24.585
even your family will forget about you.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.337
That's a scary thought.

33:46.482 --> 33:49.610
BO-MI'S DAD

33:58.870 --> 34:00.121
<i>-Hello?
</i>-Hey.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.290
What took you so long to pick up?

34:02.373 --> 34:04.000
Do you ever pick up my calls?

34:05.084 --> 34:06.377
Well…

34:07.378 --> 34:08.421
Is everything okay?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.215
If it isn't, can you come home?

34:11.299 --> 34:13.134
Hey, come on.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.054
You're talking to your husband.
Why can't you--

34:16.137 --> 34:17.597
<i>Get to the point.</i>

34:18.639 --> 34:19.474
Where's Bo-mi?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.769
Bo-mi, it's Dad.

34:22.852 --> 34:23.853
<i>No.</i>

34:24.604 --> 34:27.190
-She doesn't want to talk.
-Okay.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.526
Bye.

34:33.654 --> 34:35.531
-Sir!
-Yes.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.992
You have to come back to the office.

34:38.076 --> 34:43.748
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

34:55.760 --> 34:57.804
-I'm busy.
<i>-Wait.</i>

34:58.513 --> 35:00.556
Didn't you book Lian Wedding Hall?

35:00.640 --> 35:02.850
-Yes, we did. What is it?
-Oh, the thing is,

35:02.934 --> 35:05.103
I called them to check something for Mom,

35:05.186 --> 35:07.522
and they said
you haven't paid the deposit.

35:07.605 --> 35:08.564
What?

35:08.648 --> 35:10.483
<i>I can't get a hold of Ki-jun.</i>

35:10.566 --> 35:12.110
Is everything all right?

35:12.193 --> 35:14.987
He would never miss that.
There must have been a mistake.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.448
-It's time.
-I'll check. Bye.

35:20.493 --> 35:24.080
All right. Wait. What is that?

35:24.580 --> 35:26.040
What's that spot?

35:26.791 --> 35:29.210
Convective clouds have formed
due to an unstable atmosphere.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.003
What's the humidity there?

35:31.504 --> 35:33.923
Currently, it's about 82 percent.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.925
Will they condense and fall?

35:36.008 --> 35:37.927
The chance of evaporation
is more than 70 percent.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.638
The figures are too indefinite
to make a severe weather alert.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.682
Let's have a meeting first.

35:42.765 --> 35:43.766
Okay.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.770
We'll start the March 14
forecast discussion.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.230
Satellite center?

35:49.730 --> 35:52.692
<i>This is the satellite center.
The cloud monitor shows</i>

35:52.775 --> 35:55.611
<i>a cloud band currently
developing in the northeast.</i>

35:55.695 --> 35:58.156
<i>Please give your opinion on that,
Gangwon Office.</i>

35:58.781 --> 36:02.785
<i>Given the characteristics of this region,
it won't lead to precipitation.</i>

36:03.536 --> 36:04.871
<i>It's going to rain.</i>

36:04.954 --> 36:06.289
It will rain for sure!

36:06.372 --> 36:08.332
Why is he getting worked up again?

36:08.416 --> 36:11.127
Hey, can't you see the sky is clear?

36:11.878 --> 36:13.296
I sent you the data.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.340
This is a bomb.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.176
-It's going to pour.
-Yes. I saw it

36:18.259 --> 36:20.845
and we're having a meeting because of it.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.180
Sit here and wait.

36:22.763 --> 36:23.639
We don't have time.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.683
A heavy rain advisory
should be issued right now.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.560
Wait.

36:27.643 --> 36:30.605
Look at the spike
in the ground temperature here.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.607
Gangwon Office said it was temporary,

36:33.191 --> 36:36.861
but it's very unstable,
so it can develop into a rain cloud.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.280
Well…

36:39.363 --> 36:41.282
Here.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.326
But this is…

36:48.539 --> 36:49.749
Metropolitan Office, what is it?

36:49.832 --> 36:53.586
SEOUL METROPOLITAN OFFICE
OF METEOROLOGY

36:54.170 --> 36:56.631
<i>The clouds currently forming
in Gangwon Province</i>

36:56.714 --> 36:58.216
<i>look unusual.</i>

36:58.299 --> 37:00.468
Are you saying
they'll turn into rain clouds?

37:00.551 --> 37:02.595
-<i>Yes, within an hour.</i>
-On what grounds?

37:06.390 --> 37:07.475
Excuse me.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.979
An hour ago, they were low-level clouds.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.941
Now they're passing through Chuncheon
and developing rapidly.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.651
I'll upload the data and explain.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.414
There he goes again.

37:32.541 --> 37:34.919
He's the one who predicted the hail.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.214
-So?
-I thought you should know.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.014
<i>Don't you know
how dry the atmosphere is now?</i>

37:47.098 --> 37:49.642
<i>Even if the rain clouds are large enough
to be caught as an echo,</i>

37:49.725 --> 37:53.562
they'll evaporate
before reaching the metropolitan area.

37:53.646 --> 37:57.525
What if they continue
to absorb water while moving north?

38:00.778 --> 38:03.030
<i>They're being supplied with water vapor</i>

38:03.114 --> 38:05.491
as the lower layer temperature
of the region rises.

38:05.574 --> 38:09.203
<i>Just an hour ago, the clouds
were only two kilometers thick.</i>

38:09.287 --> 38:13.040
Currently, they're 5 to 6km thick.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.419
<i>Moreover, the surface temperature
in the east metropolitan area is high.</i>

38:16.502 --> 38:19.547
<i>Due to the unstable atmosphere,
clouds are more likely to develop</i>

38:19.630 --> 38:21.674
<i>and enter the region
rather than evaporate.</i>

38:22.258 --> 38:23.676
If my prediction is correct,

38:23.759 --> 38:25.845
in two to three hours,

38:25.928 --> 38:28.180
there will be heavy rain
in the metropolitan area.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.314
Just tell me
the probability of precipitation.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.274
<i>Yes, it's…</i>

38:38.357 --> 38:40.067
It's about 18.7 to 18.8 percent.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.236
<i>-That's correct.
-So…</i>

38:43.029 --> 38:46.741
the probability of evaporation
is more than 80 percent.

38:46.824 --> 38:50.411
Why are you making it sound difficult
by using decimal points?

38:51.329 --> 38:52.913
Acting Director Jin.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.082
What do you think?

39:48.636 --> 39:52.473
<i>I checked again and they said
the wedding hall deposit wasn't paid.</i>

39:53.307 --> 39:54.767
<i>They told Ki-jun that</i>

39:54.850 --> 39:57.770
<i>the reservation will be canceled
if he doesn't pay by today.</i>

40:03.776 --> 40:05.694
<i>It's not even midsummer.</i>

40:05.778 --> 40:07.154
<i>It's mid-March.</i>

40:07.238 --> 40:10.491
A heavy rain advisory
with less than a 20 percent chance?

40:10.574 --> 40:12.493
<i>I don't think we need to worry
with these numbers.</i>

40:13.411 --> 40:15.913
Isn't the default setting wrong

40:15.996 --> 40:18.249
because you're stuck
with the seasonal formula?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.461
Forecasting is about probabilities.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.588
-That's why you're always wrong.
-What?

40:24.672 --> 40:26.549
The 17th summer typhoon last year,

40:26.632 --> 40:29.009
the winter fog this year,
and the hail too.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.262
You relied on probability,
and see what happened.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.097
<i>Why have forecasters at all</i>

40:33.180 --> 40:35.766
when we can have
supercomputers calculate the weather?

40:39.395 --> 40:40.938
POWER OFF

40:42.314 --> 40:44.608
Weather is about a flow.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.278
You can't change the flow
with a few numbers.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.281
The basics of weather is variability.

40:50.364 --> 40:52.950
Even a small phenomenon
can greatly affect it.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.410
Are you trying to lecture me?

40:55.244 --> 40:56.370
No.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.998
<i>I'm just saying that
the important points are different.</i>

40:59.081 --> 41:01.584
<i>Enough. Move aside.</i>

41:02.501 --> 41:03.711
All right.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.005
Acting Director Jin.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.299
You need to make a decision.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.933
Why don't we do this?

41:24.482 --> 41:27.860
The hypothesis suggested by
the Metropolitan Office is reasonable,

41:27.943 --> 41:29.695
but the probability is too low.

41:30.446 --> 41:31.655
The evidence is weak,

41:31.739 --> 41:33.616
and no cases were provided.

41:33.699 --> 41:36.327
-I collected all the data and…
-Calm down.

41:36.410 --> 41:40.581
We'll decide whether to issue
a heavy rain advisory after an hour.

41:41.916 --> 41:45.211
Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Office
should provide additional data.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.464
Let's move on to the weekend weather.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.098
Hey!

42:04.355 --> 42:07.024
He won't just let it go.

42:08.734 --> 42:10.819
-Do you know him?
-He's Lee Si-woo.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.572
I've worked with him
on Baengnyeong Island.

42:13.656 --> 42:14.907
I see.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.992
He's usually quite gentle.

42:17.076 --> 42:20.788
But when it comes to weather,
he's very tenacious.

42:22.456 --> 42:23.874
It's a little unsettling

42:24.458 --> 42:27.169
because there's always something
when he's persistent.

42:35.594 --> 42:37.012
<i>Hi. It's me.</i>

42:37.846 --> 42:39.306
Yes. What is it?

42:39.390 --> 42:41.100
<i>You can issue a special alert, right?</i>

42:42.351 --> 42:43.769
Yes, so what?

42:44.728 --> 42:45.938
I have a feeling.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.232
Hey.

42:49.149 --> 42:50.442
No.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.945
I can't do it.

42:53.028 --> 42:55.281
You missed the hail.
Will you miss the rain too?

42:55.990 --> 42:57.032
Hey.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.913
You're nuts.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.459
Anything else from other offices?

43:07.543 --> 43:08.502
-No.
-No.

43:10.337 --> 43:11.797
That's it for the meeting.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.674
-Good work.
-Good work.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.175
Good work.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.974
Are you insane? What are you doing?

43:27.521 --> 43:28.439
What's going on?

43:29.023 --> 43:32.151
The Metropolitan Office issued
a heavy rain advisory just now.

43:32.776 --> 43:33.777
What?

43:37.615 --> 43:38.574
Did you do this?

43:39.992 --> 43:43.579
Why did you do this
without reporting it to the director?

43:43.662 --> 43:45.956
Because she wouldn't listen.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.208
She also ignored the hail signals

43:48.917 --> 43:50.586
because the probability was low.

43:52.087 --> 43:53.088
What is he saying?

43:54.840 --> 43:58.093
The Metropolitan Office
had reported hail signals.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.470
The forecaster you just saw

44:00.304 --> 44:01.513
detected them first.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.350
It was less than five percent.

44:04.433 --> 44:06.101
It was close to five percent.

44:08.354 --> 44:12.650
So, that's why you declared severe weather
without your superior's permission?

44:13.484 --> 44:14.318
Is it?

44:14.401 --> 44:17.613
If you'll do whatever you want,
why do you need superiors and a system?

44:18.447 --> 44:21.367
Why don't you set up
a forecasting company then?

44:22.868 --> 44:23.952
I'm sorry.

44:29.416 --> 44:32.628
A severe weather alert has been issued.
So keep your posts.

44:33.921 --> 44:34.922
I need to talk to you.

44:36.382 --> 44:37.424
Okay.

44:48.644 --> 44:50.062
This is insane.

44:57.152 --> 44:59.655
Why didn't you report it to Director Choi?

45:01.031 --> 45:03.117
Because the probability was low.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.329
So…

45:08.163 --> 45:10.791
why did you skip the director
and make that decision?

45:10.874 --> 45:12.042
Why?

45:17.965 --> 45:19.049
Okay.

45:19.716 --> 45:21.301
File a report.

45:23.303 --> 45:25.013
Shut up.

45:25.097 --> 45:27.808
If it doesn't rain in an hour, we're dead.

45:27.891 --> 45:30.102
<i>Don't worry. It'll rain.</i>

45:31.395 --> 45:32.312
Hey.

45:33.647 --> 45:36.608
You're the one who declared severe weather
without permission from Headquarters?

45:38.944 --> 45:40.779
Yes. So?

45:42.072 --> 45:45.284
Do you know how much it costs
when a severe weather alert is issued?

45:45.868 --> 45:48.120
Will you take responsibility
if this forecast is wrong?

45:50.706 --> 45:52.124
Did you take responsibility

45:52.207 --> 45:55.377
for being wrong about the hail forecast?

45:55.461 --> 45:56.670
<i>What?</i>

45:56.753 --> 45:59.840
No, you weren't wrong.
You didn't report it at all.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.384
<i>I heard about your situation.</i>

46:02.468 --> 46:05.512
<i>But even if you're busy
getting ready for your wedding,</i>

46:05.596 --> 46:08.557
you shouldn't miss any weather reports.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.894
Forecasters shouldn't neglect
the safety and convenience

46:11.977 --> 46:14.104
of the people for personal reasons.

46:16.356 --> 46:18.609
-Hey.
-My name is Lee Si-woo.

46:19.526 --> 46:20.402
Lee Si-woo.

46:20.486 --> 46:22.696
Will I take responsibility
for this forecast?

46:23.280 --> 46:25.741
<i>Let me tell you about my responsibilities.</i>

46:25.824 --> 46:29.077
<i>I use the data I've obtained
to predict the weather and make forecasts.</i>

46:29.161 --> 46:31.205
I'm confident in my forecast.

46:31.288 --> 46:34.625
That confidence comes
only when I do my best.

46:34.708 --> 46:36.627
The same goes with the hail forecast.

46:36.710 --> 46:40.839
Are you telling me
that I didn't do my best?

46:40.923 --> 46:42.925
You have a wedding coming up,

46:43.008 --> 46:45.511
-<i>so I understand.</i>
-Hey, you!

46:45.594 --> 46:47.221
I'm Lee Si-woo of the Metropolitan Office.

46:49.473 --> 46:50.599
Hey, Lee Si-woo.

46:51.350 --> 46:52.518
Wait right there.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.978
Why? Are you coming?

46:55.562 --> 46:56.855
I said wait.

Of course not.

49:07.569 --> 49:08.528
Jeez.

49:09.279 --> 49:12.699
She probably got mad
because you were being rude and…

49:13.700 --> 49:14.785
Goodness. She's here.

49:23.001 --> 49:26.129
Well, I'm done here.
I think she's here to see you.

49:26.213 --> 49:27.214
Mr. Lee Si-woo?

49:38.183 --> 49:40.686
-You really came.
-Do you know me?

49:40.769 --> 49:41.978
No.

49:42.062 --> 49:44.439
Then how dare you talk about me like that?

49:45.524 --> 49:47.526
That's because you kept ignoring my--

49:47.609 --> 49:49.695
Didn't you think
that maybe I was being careful?

49:49.778 --> 49:52.781
In any case, you didn't report it,
so a lot of people suffered--

49:52.864 --> 49:54.950
Do you know how much
public manpower is used

49:55.033 --> 49:57.452
every time a special advisory is issued?

49:57.536 --> 50:00.622
Billions could have been wasted
because of an under five percent chance.

50:00.706 --> 50:02.332
I had no choice but to consider that.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.793
Still, you can't ignore the signals.

50:04.876 --> 50:07.921
If it rains an hour later
than our forecast,

50:08.004 --> 50:09.673
people mock us for making an error.

50:09.756 --> 50:11.299
What if the heavy rain advisory is wrong?

50:12.259 --> 50:14.928
So you chose to make a safe bet.

50:15.011 --> 50:16.263
What?

50:16.346 --> 50:19.015
"Since we'll get criticized either way,

50:19.099 --> 50:21.143
let's choose not to waste money."

50:21.727 --> 50:24.479
"Let's try to avoid
one of the two arrows."

50:25.105 --> 50:26.606
Is that what you were thinking?

50:30.694 --> 50:32.279
If so, don't worry.

50:32.362 --> 50:34.823
It will rain. I'm certain of it.

50:41.830 --> 50:43.206
Who do you think you are?

50:43.915 --> 50:47.002
<i>Si</i> as in time and <i>Woo</i> as in rain.
Rain that falls at the right time.

50:47.836 --> 50:49.004
I'm Lee Si-woo.

51:13.278 --> 51:14.613
<i>It's going to rain.</i>

51:45.727 --> 51:48.230
NAMSAN

51:48.313 --> 51:49.439
Gosh, that's…

51:51.858 --> 51:52.818
Sir.

51:52.901 --> 51:55.195
DONGJAK BRIDGE

51:57.989 --> 51:59.491
I can see that.

52:01.368 --> 52:02.494
Gosh, look at that.

52:08.041 --> 52:09.709
Would you look at that?

53:36.588 --> 53:37.881
Take it.

53:38.548 --> 53:39.841
It's pouring.

54:14.751 --> 54:16.002
CALL ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS

54:16.086 --> 54:17.587
THIS IS URGENT

54:17.671 --> 54:19.172
<i>Did you check with Ki-jun?</i>

54:22.342 --> 54:24.719
MESSAGES

54:24.803 --> 54:28.306
<i>I emailed Mr. Han to confirm the
final draft of your wedding invitation,</i>

54:28.390 --> 54:29.933
<i>but he didn't reply.</i>

54:30.016 --> 54:31.142
<i>Please confirm.</i>

54:31.226 --> 54:33.019
<i>-Your honeymoon reservation
-The wedding return gifts</i>

54:33.103 --> 54:34.604
<i>-has been canceled due to late payment.
-you ordered</i>

54:34.688 --> 54:36.398
<i>-has been canceled.
-Your wedding dress is ready.</i>

54:36.481 --> 54:38.149
<i>-But I got a cancellation message.
-Please call us.</i>

54:38.233 --> 54:39.192
<i>It's been canceled.</i>

54:39.275 --> 54:40.485
<i>-Please confirm.
-Please call us.</i>

54:48.159 --> 54:50.954
KI-JUN

54:52.622 --> 54:56.042
<i>The number you are calling
is currently switched off.</i>

54:56.126 --> 54:58.878
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

55:19.649 --> 55:20.900
What did she say?

55:25.572 --> 55:27.949
Ha-kyung isn't picking up either.

55:30.201 --> 55:33.329
I think we'll lose
the wedding hall reservation.

55:56.269 --> 55:57.645
<i>Doors opening.</i>

56:04.861 --> 56:06.237
<i>Doors closing.</i>

56:58.414 --> 57:00.333
<i>The signals were simple.</i>

57:07.298 --> 57:09.843
<i>Sometimes they were sounds.</i>

57:17.517 --> 57:20.311
<i>Sometimes they were colors…</i>

57:47.881 --> 57:49.591
<i>and sometimes they were vibrations.</i>

58:32.759 --> 58:35.386
<i>They kept signaling to me…</i>

58:37.180 --> 58:41.184
<i>that nothing was safe in this world.</i>

58:59.619 --> 59:00.954
Just in case.

59:10.505 --> 59:11.422
You're home.

59:24.102 --> 59:25.436
What's all this?

59:26.062 --> 59:27.146
It's food for our trip.

59:28.773 --> 59:30.817
It'll stop raining tomorrow morning.

59:31.401 --> 59:32.569
So there's no problem.

59:38.908 --> 59:40.118
This?

59:40.201 --> 59:41.452
It's for an emergency.

59:41.536 --> 59:42.870
We aren't going camping.

59:42.954 --> 59:45.248
I booked a cottage.

59:51.671 --> 59:52.589
Let's break up.

59:55.258 --> 59:56.342
What?

59:57.218 --> 59:58.511
I want to break up.

1:00:06.185 --> 1:00:07.562
Why all of a sudden?

1:00:08.146 --> 1:00:09.355
It isn't all of a sudden.

1:00:10.815 --> 1:00:14.110
I've been wanting to break up
with you for a long time.

1:00:46.392 --> 1:00:49.312
2 MONTHS LATER

1:00:49.395 --> 1:00:51.147
That star is so bright.

1:00:51.981 --> 1:00:54.025
The sky cleared up nicely.

1:00:54.901 --> 1:00:56.861
That's a satellite, Director Choi.

1:00:56.944 --> 1:00:58.196
Hey.

1:00:58.863 --> 1:01:01.491
Why are you always so rigid?

1:01:01.574 --> 1:01:03.576
I know it's a satellite.

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:05.244
All right.

1:01:07.413 --> 1:01:10.333
That's why I always trusted what you said

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:12.585
even when I don't trust my wife.

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.632
I should've been rigid then too.

1:01:18.549 --> 1:01:19.676
When?

1:01:20.343 --> 1:01:21.761
The day it hailed?

1:01:29.185 --> 1:01:31.437
Sir, I think you should check this.

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:33.523
What? Gosh…

1:01:36.818 --> 1:01:37.944
What is it?

1:01:39.112 --> 1:01:40.321
Never mind.

1:01:48.788 --> 1:01:51.916
We were on alert all week
because of the fog.

1:01:52.834 --> 1:01:56.546
I know you didn't report it because
you were afraid I'd be overwhelmed.

1:01:59.340 --> 1:02:00.758
I was presumptuous.

1:02:00.842 --> 1:02:03.511
Would it have been different
if you had reported it?

1:02:04.262 --> 1:02:05.304
No.

1:02:05.805 --> 1:02:07.598
I would have ignored it too.

1:02:08.099 --> 1:02:10.810
The fog was extremely thick
in the west coast area that day.

1:02:11.602 --> 1:02:14.856
Thanks to you,
we prevented a major collision

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:16.899
like the Yeongjong Bridge collision.

1:02:18.234 --> 1:02:20.027
Nobody knows that though.

1:02:21.487 --> 1:02:23.072
So what if no one knows?

1:02:23.156 --> 1:02:24.657
It's great that nobody was hurt.

1:02:26.909 --> 1:02:28.411
I hope you return soon.

1:02:28.494 --> 1:02:31.706
Didn't you know? I resigned.

1:02:32.707 --> 1:02:33.833
Sir.

1:02:34.917 --> 1:02:38.588
I'm going to do everything
I wasn't able to do.

1:02:38.671 --> 1:02:39.797
Why did you--

1:02:41.549 --> 1:02:43.176
My wife is really happy.

1:02:48.848 --> 1:02:49.766
Thanks.

1:02:50.725 --> 1:02:52.351
If it wasn't for you,

1:02:52.435 --> 1:02:54.854
I wouldn't have retired this early.

1:02:55.855 --> 1:02:59.400
I'm relieved that you're taking my place.

1:03:08.826 --> 1:03:11.245
My life is about to be flooded

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:13.206
because I missed the signals.

1:03:18.503 --> 1:03:20.963
What you see now isn't everything.

1:03:21.047 --> 1:03:24.300
Both weather and people need time
for you to get to know them better.

1:03:24.383 --> 1:03:26.636
The weather isn't always bad.

1:03:27.595 --> 1:03:29.889
There are sunny days

1:03:30.389 --> 1:03:32.725
as well as windy and rainy days.

1:03:34.769 --> 1:03:36.729
There's always a reason for everything.

1:03:54.455 --> 1:03:57.166
PERSONNEL CHANGES
JIN HA-KYUNG: DIRECTOR

1:03:57.250 --> 1:03:58.876
Will she be okay?

1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.795
Well, she's smart.

1:04:01.420 --> 1:04:05.883
Supercomputers are smart too,
but they make mistakes.

1:04:06.551 --> 1:04:10.429
Experience is the most
important quality for directors.

1:04:10.513 --> 1:04:13.891
She'll always play by the book
and be picky.

1:04:14.559 --> 1:04:17.270
Then what's going to happen?

1:04:18.104 --> 1:04:19.230
What do you mean?

1:04:19.313 --> 1:04:22.316
Deputy Director Han will be back
from his honeymoon soon.

1:04:23.192 --> 1:04:25.403
Will they be okay working together?

1:04:25.486 --> 1:04:27.280
They have no choice.

1:04:27.363 --> 1:04:29.365
They can't just quit their jobs.

1:04:29.448 --> 1:04:32.743
People around them
are going to be stressed out.

1:04:32.827 --> 1:04:34.579
It'll be like walking on egg--

1:04:35.496 --> 1:04:37.248
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:04:37.832 --> 1:04:39.292
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:04:39.375 --> 1:04:40.543
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:04:40.626 --> 1:04:43.880
SAFE COUNTRY, PEACEFUL PEOPLE

1:04:50.344 --> 1:04:51.470
Did you see it?

1:04:52.096 --> 1:04:53.598
The personnel changes?

1:04:53.681 --> 1:04:55.558
Yes, I saw it.

1:04:58.144 --> 1:04:59.437
Well…

1:05:00.187 --> 1:05:02.231
about Deputy Director Han.

1:05:04.108 --> 1:05:05.318
I guess you didn't see it.

1:05:06.611 --> 1:05:08.487
The transfer was canceled.

1:05:12.325 --> 1:05:14.327
He's good at responding to the press.

1:05:14.410 --> 1:05:17.371
So the Administrator
wants to keep him around

1:05:17.455 --> 1:05:19.624
because he thinks highly of that.

1:05:21.584 --> 1:05:22.752
I see.

1:05:23.794 --> 1:05:25.129
Will you be okay?

1:05:26.672 --> 1:05:29.383
I'd be happy if you stayed
with Chief Team Two.

1:05:29.467 --> 1:05:33.304
But you'll have to keep working with him.
Is that all right?

1:05:41.228 --> 1:05:44.690
Why don't you follow
in the footsteps of your colleagues

1:05:45.399 --> 1:05:47.860
and aim for higher-ranking positions?

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:53.449
You have enough field experience.

1:05:54.367 --> 1:05:57.536
Are you telling me
to leave the Forecast Bureau?

1:05:57.620 --> 1:06:02.416
There's an opportunity for you
to go to the WMO for dispatch training.

1:06:04.669 --> 1:06:06.921
You have more than enough experience.

1:06:07.505 --> 1:06:09.715
I'll write a reference letter.
What do you say?

1:06:12.843 --> 1:06:15.429
-It's in Geneva, Switzerland, right?
-Yes.

1:06:15.513 --> 1:06:18.432
It's for one year and it can be extended.

1:06:19.308 --> 1:06:23.062
<i>There was more than just a breakup
at the end of an office romance.</i>

1:07:12.570 --> 1:07:15.281
Tae-kyung, did you take my TV?

1:07:15.364 --> 1:07:16.741
It's not there?

1:07:17.908 --> 1:07:20.995
Mom, did you move Ha-kyung's TV?

1:07:21.495 --> 1:07:23.289
Why would I?

1:07:23.998 --> 1:07:26.542
I know how angry she gets
when I move her stuff.

1:07:27.460 --> 1:07:30.254
<i>Why? Is her TV missing?</i>

1:07:30.337 --> 1:07:32.256
No. Never mind. I'm hanging up.

1:07:56.197 --> 1:07:59.617
OFFICE OF SPOKESPERSON
HAN KI-JUN

1:08:06.582 --> 1:08:07.416
No.

1:08:09.794 --> 1:08:12.171
OFFICE OF SPOKESPERSON
HAN KI-JUN

1:08:14.465 --> 1:08:16.509
Hello? What's up?

1:08:17.468 --> 1:08:18.511
What?

1:08:19.136 --> 1:08:22.848
Oh, I guess my finger slipped.

1:08:23.891 --> 1:08:26.727
I'm doing well, as always.

1:08:27.561 --> 1:08:28.562
Well…

1:08:29.939 --> 1:08:32.441
did you perhaps take the TV?

1:08:32.525 --> 1:08:35.194
Yes, I took it.

1:08:36.153 --> 1:08:38.405
-The induction stove too?
-Yes.

1:08:38.489 --> 1:08:39.865
The toothbrush sanitizer too?

1:08:39.949 --> 1:08:42.743
You told me to pack up and leave.

1:08:43.244 --> 1:08:45.162
I thought you meant
I could take what I needed.

1:08:45.788 --> 1:08:46.831
No?

1:08:47.706 --> 1:08:50.668
How could you interpret it that way?

1:08:51.293 --> 1:08:53.170
I said take your stuff and leave.

1:08:53.879 --> 1:08:54.839
Hey.

1:08:55.339 --> 1:08:57.591
Technically, half of the stuff is mine

1:08:57.675 --> 1:08:59.385
because we paid for it together.

1:08:59.468 --> 1:09:01.053
I left the fridge behind,

1:09:01.137 --> 1:09:02.513
so I think we're even.

1:09:06.684 --> 1:09:08.686
What about the apartment registration?

1:09:09.478 --> 1:09:10.396
Listen, Ha-kyung.

1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:13.482
I've been thinking about it,
so how about we do this?

1:09:14.525 --> 1:09:16.026
I'll give you your money back,

1:09:16.110 --> 1:09:17.319
and take it off your hand.

1:09:18.445 --> 1:09:19.530
Take what off?

1:09:19.613 --> 1:09:21.615
The apartment is under both our names.

1:09:22.241 --> 1:09:24.326
Rather than selling it to someone else,

1:09:24.410 --> 1:09:25.619
it'll be better this way.

1:09:27.037 --> 1:09:28.205
You said it was alimony

1:09:28.289 --> 1:09:30.040
when you called the wedding off.

1:09:30.124 --> 1:09:32.459
I did. I said that but…

1:09:32.543 --> 1:09:33.419
But?

1:09:33.502 --> 1:09:35.921
I checked the price and it went up a lot.

1:09:36.547 --> 1:09:37.423
So?

1:09:40.050 --> 1:09:42.303
Let's split it. Half and half.

1:09:45.514 --> 1:09:47.057
<i>As expected,</i>

1:09:47.141 --> 1:09:51.562
<i>a breakup wasn't enough
to end things with this bastard.</i>

1:10:25.137 --> 1:10:26.513
<i>Like the wind,</i>

1:10:26.597 --> 1:10:29.808
<i>an affair is invisible
but it always leaves a trace.</i>

1:10:29.892 --> 1:10:30.976
You can go about your day and leave.

1:10:31.060 --> 1:10:33.812
I'm the new Severe Weather Forecaster
of Chief Team Two.

1:10:33.896 --> 1:10:34.813
I was appointed here.

1:10:34.897 --> 1:10:37.608
<i>I think Director Jin will
get replaced soon.</i>
