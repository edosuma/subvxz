<b>It is effective for concealing your presence,</b>

00:38.720 --> 00:44.020
<b>Four Major Principles</b>

00:39.810 --> 00:43.040
<b>and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

<b><i>Sorry, Wing-san.</i></b>

02:09.950 --> 02:13.480
<b><i>But I'm itching to fight right now!</i></b>

02:13.480 --> 02:18.490
<b>Fierce x And x Ferocious</b>

02:21.530 --> 02:23.480
<b>Gon is in his first 200s match,</b>

02:23.480 --> 02:26.160
<b>but he's been caught off guard 
by the unexpected nature</b>

02:26.160 --> 02:27.820
<b>of his opponent's attack.</b>

02:54.510 --> 02:57.670
<b>He's been hit from behind by another top!</b>

02:57.670 --> 02:59.930
<b>Gon is in big trouble,</b>

02:59.930 --> 03:02.650
<b>after having been surrounded by Dancing Tops!</b>

03:12.310 --> 03:14.620
<b>Clean hit and knockdown!</b>

03:14.620 --> 03:15.850
<b>Two points!</b>

03:15.850 --> 03:18.580
<b>Gido has already earned four points!</b>

03:18.580 --> 03:19.450
<b>Can you continue?</b>

03:19.450 --> 03:20.220
<b>You bet!</b>

03:21.160 --> 03:24.340
<b><i>There are too many tops for me to track.</i></b>

03:24.340 --> 03:25.220
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

03:25.770 --> 03:27.220
<b><i>What should I do?</i></b>

03:29.480 --> 03:31.310
<b>M-Master...</b>

03:31.310 --> 03:33.310
<b>Is he using <i>Nen</i>?</b>

03:33.730 --> 03:36.450
<b>Yes, that is a form of <i>Hatsu</i>.</b>

03:36.450 --> 03:38.730
<b>He's projecting his aura into the tops.</b>

03:39.040 --> 03:40.160
<b>That allows the tops</b>

03:40.160 --> 03:45.160
<b>to move with more strength and 
speed than normally possible.</b>

03:46.070 --> 03:48.930
<b>Manipulating a small object requires 
only a small amount of aura.</b>

03:48.930 --> 03:52.250
<b>A large object requires a 
larger amount of aura.</b>

03:53.030 --> 03:58.000
<b>Gido is also using <i>Nen</i> in other ways here.</b>

03:58.710 --> 04:01.690
<b>Those tops couldn't be so strong</b>

04:01.690 --> 04:05.010
<b>were he simply using his aura to spin them.</b>

04:05.720 --> 04:07.530
<b>It can only be accomplished</b>

04:07.530 --> 04:10.680
<b>because he cares deeply about his tops.</b>

04:11.410 --> 04:13.190
<b>Objects respond well</b>

04:13.190 --> 04:16.980
<b>to those who are compatible.</b>

04:19.160 --> 04:21.360
<b><i>I can't follow them with my eyes.</i></b>

04:21.960 --> 04:24.200
<b><i></i>Nen<i> is powering the tops!</i></b>

04:24.200 --> 04:25.860
<b><i>I can sense it.</i></b>

04:30.120 --> 04:32.450
<b><i>Yeah, I can sense them.</i></b>

04:33.790 --> 04:35.040
<b><i>My </i>Ten<i> is fading!</i></b>

04:36.460 --> 04:38.270
<b>Another direct hit!</b>

04:38.270 --> 04:40.300
<b>Gon is completely helpless!</b>

04:40.300 --> 04:42.770
<b>He's been knocked out of the ring!</b>

04:47.080 --> 04:49.320
<b>The score is now 6-0!</b>

04:49.320 --> 04:51.610
<b>He's dug himself a big hole!</b>

04:51.610 --> 04:52.520
<b><i>It won't work...</i></b>

04:52.520 --> 04:54.830
<b><i>If I focus on sensing the tops,</i></b>

04:54.830 --> 04:57.800
<b><i>my </i>Ten<i> shroud will dissolve.</i></b>

04:57.800 --> 04:59.010
<b><i>What should I do?</i></b>

05:02.070 --> 05:04.150
<b><i>A top was knocked outside the ring?</i></b>

05:04.760 --> 05:07.290
<b><i>But it isn't attacking me...</i></b>

05:07.290 --> 05:09.800
<b>What's wrong? Can you continue fighting?</b>

05:09.800 --> 05:13.030
<b>Be quiet! I'm thinking right now.</b>

05:13.030 --> 05:15.820
<b>If you're not in the ring within a ten-count, 
I'll rule you the loser!</b>

05:15.820 --> 05:16.540
<b>One!</b>

05:16.540 --> 05:17.940
<b><i>Now that I think about it,</i></b>

05:17.940 --> 05:21.460
<b><i>the </i>Nen<i> in this top didn't feel hostile.</i></b>

05:22.190 --> 05:23.430
<b><i>What about the others?</i></b>

05:23.960 --> 05:28.260
<b><i>They're spinning around, 
bumping into each other.</i></b>

05:28.780 --> 05:32.560
<b><i>Maybe the tops aren't actually targeting me?</i></b>

05:32.910 --> 05:33.790
<b>Four!</b>

05:33.790 --> 05:35.950
<b>Why are you standing outside the ring?</b>

05:35.950 --> 05:38.810
<b>If I stay in the ring, I'll get hurt!</b>

05:38.810 --> 05:39.540
<b>Five!</b>

05:39.540 --> 05:40.740
<b>Just as I thought...</b>

05:41.920 --> 05:44.820
<b>This is like a game of sumo tops!</b>

05:45.420 --> 05:49.430
<b>It's impossible to command tops 
to move with precision.</b>

05:49.430 --> 05:51.700
<b>It's likely Gido simply commands the tops</b>

05:52.370 --> 05:54.700
<b>to strike anything in their way.</b>

05:55.380 --> 05:58.140
<b>They spin around, striking whatever</b>

05:58.140 --> 06:00.960
<b>happens to cross their paths.</b>

06:01.310 --> 06:02.240
<b>Seven!</b>

06:03.230 --> 06:06.590
<b><i>In that case, I don't need to fear the tops.</i></b>

06:07.170 --> 06:10.140
<b><i>I can ignore the tops, and attack him!</i></b>

06:12.730 --> 06:15.360
<b>Heh, you may have figured out my tops,</b>

06:15.360 --> 06:17.810
<b>but you still can't land an attack!</b>

06:19.700 --> 06:20.960
<b>There it is!</b>

06:20.960 --> 06:23.980
<b>Gido's special technique, 
combining offense and defense!</b>

06:23.980 --> 06:25.690
<b><i>Tornado Top!</i></b>

06:25.110 --> 06:26.030
<b>Tornado Top</b>

06:27.310 --> 06:30.860
<b>He lands a strong counter on Gon!</b>

06:34.900 --> 06:36.370
<b>Three points!</b>

06:36.370 --> 06:39.030
<b>The judge has awarded a 
critical hit and knockdown!</b>

06:39.030 --> 06:40.500
<b>Gido has nine points!</b>

06:40.500 --> 06:43.100
<b>Gon is on the verge of losing!</b>

06:46.450 --> 06:48.960
<b>I turn myself into a top to protect myself,</b>

06:48.960 --> 06:51.760
<b>while using my Dancing Tops to attack.</b>

06:51.760 --> 06:53.660
<b>My strategy might be boring,</b>

06:53.660 --> 06:56.350
<b>but it's effective for racking up points.</b>

06:56.940 --> 06:59.820
<b>There are a number of ways to defeat Gido.</b>

06:59.820 --> 07:01.160
<b>You can attack him until</b>

07:01.160 --> 07:03.860
<b>he tires, and his <i>Ten</i> begins to fade.</b>

07:03.860 --> 07:07.230
<b>You can use <i>Hatsu</i> that overpowers his defense.</b>

07:07.850 --> 07:11.740
<b>Both methods require a large amount of aura.</b>

07:12.270 --> 07:14.640
<b>However, Gon-kun doesn't know <i>Ren</i>,</b>

07:14.640 --> 07:17.370
<b>the technique to instantly generate aura.</b>

07:18.200 --> 07:20.870
<b>Learning how to quickly 
create large amounts of aura,</b>

07:20.870 --> 07:24.030
<b>and how to channel it into attacks,</b>

07:24.030 --> 07:29.380
<b>requires endless training and 
combat experience to learn.</b>

07:30.050 --> 07:32.380
<b>He'd need five more years 
before he could fight Gido.</b>

07:33.560 --> 07:36.330
<b>I'm sure he's beginning to realize that now.</b>

07:38.410 --> 07:39.750
<b><i>What should I do?</i></b>

07:42.060 --> 07:44.760
<b><i>What will it take to prolong this match?</i></b>

07:46.160 --> 07:48.500
<b><i>If he scores one more point, it's over.</i></b>

07:49.330 --> 07:51.300
<b><i>But I want to keep fighting.</i></b>

07:52.930 --> 07:54.910
<b><i>What can I do right now?</i></b>

07:56.530 --> 07:57.660
<b><i>That would be...</i></b>

07:58.910 --> 07:59.660
<b>Gon!</b>

08:10.090 --> 08:11.420
<b><i>He released his </i>Ten<i>?</i></b>

08:12.580 --> 08:14.320
<b><i>That's reckless!</i></b>

08:14.890 --> 08:17.070
<b><i>But he didn't simply release it.</i></b>

08:17.070 --> 08:18.180
<b><i>That's...</i></b>

08:18.180 --> 08:19.380
<b><i>Zetsu...</i></b>

08:19.930 --> 08:22.280
<b><i>The technique for concealing your presence!</i></b>

08:22.830 --> 08:26.020
<b><i>Your aura also disappears because 
your micropyles are sealed.</i></b>

08:26.020 --> 08:28.910
<b><i>Any aura that normally escapes 
your body is also nullified,</i></b>

08:28.910 --> 08:31.570
<b><i>so he has no </i>Nen<i> protection!</i></b>

08:31.570 --> 08:33.440
<b><i>I didn't teach him </i>Zetsu<i> use!</i></b>

08:33.440 --> 08:36.030
<b><i>Did he learn it on his own, before we met?</i></b>

08:36.030 --> 08:39.280
<b><i>In that case, he wouldn't realize 
that this is </i>Zetsu<i>.</i></b>

08:39.870 --> 08:42.770
<b><i>He must have learned it while</i></b>

08:42.770 --> 08:46.770
<b><i>attempting to track a beast or other target...</i></b>

08:48.780 --> 08:51.520
<b><i>The boy certainly has incredible potential.</i></b>

08:52.590 --> 08:56.030
<b><i>But why would he use it now, 
in this situation?</i></b>

08:57.220 --> 08:58.380
<b>Idiot!</b>

08:58.380 --> 09:02.730
<b>If you're hit by a <i>Nen</i> attack, without protection, 
you'll be totally messed up!</b>

09:03.080 --> 09:04.580
<b><i>I know that.</i></b>

09:04.580 --> 09:10.200
<b><i>But in order to track the tops' complex 
pathing with only sensations to go on,</i></b>

09:10.200 --> 09:12.810
<b><i>I must focus all my senses...</i></b>

09:13.440 --> 09:14.720
<b><i>Could it be that</i></b>

09:14.720 --> 09:16.710
<b><i>he never expected to win?</i></b>

09:17.330 --> 09:19.490
<b><i>He's risking his life...</i></b>

09:20.590 --> 09:24.060
<b><i>Risking his life to train?</i></b>

09:26.200 --> 09:28.340
<b>You don't want to live, kid?</b>

09:28.340 --> 09:30.840
<b>Then I'll help you die!</b>

09:38.260 --> 09:39.260
<b>What?!</b>

09:41.860 --> 09:43.020
<b>Amazing!</b>

09:43.020 --> 09:46.020
<b>It's the first time Gon has managed 
to evade an attack!</b>

09:47.480 --> 09:48.790
<b><i>I can feel them...</i></b>

09:49.850 --> 09:52.020
<b><i>I know where they're heading!</i></b>

09:54.570 --> 09:56.920
<b><i>This is all I can do right now...</i></b>

09:57.810 --> 10:00.810
<b><i>Concentrate on dodging 
my opponent's attacks!</i></b>

10:12.260 --> 10:15.410
<b><i>I can still fight!</i></b>

10:31.900 --> 10:35.580
<b>Your right radius and ulna were both broken.</b>

10:35.580 --> 10:37.150
<b>Fractured humerus.</b>

10:37.890 --> 10:40.200
<b>Three broken ribs.</b>

10:40.200 --> 10:42.410
<b>Twelve other minor fractures.</b>

10:43.080 --> 10:45.150
<b>Four months before you're

10:49.900 --> 10:51.420
<b>You moron!</b>

10:52.650 --> 10:53.700
<b>Sorry.</b>

10:54.420 --> 10:56.770
<b>An apology won't help!</b>

10:56.770 --> 10:58.810
<b>Do you have any brains in there?</b>

10:58.810 --> 11:01.100
<b>Didn't you see what happened

<b>the traditional <i>Nen</i> greeting?</b>

11:02.930 --> 11:05.810
<b>One wrong move, and you could

11:05.810 --> 11:07.180
<b>You're lucky not to be</b>

<b>hurt any worse.</b>

11:08.720 --> 11:12.770
<b>Man, why do you think 
Four-Eyes was training us?</b>

11:14.170 --> 11:15.190
<b>Still...</b>

11:15.600 --> 11:17.440
<b>I had a feeling I'd be okay.</b>

11:18.240 --> 11:20.390
<b>I took a few hits,</b>

11:20.390 --> 11:22.990
<b>but I wasn't in mortal danger, as long 
as he missed my vital spots...</b>

11:29.080 --> 11:30.000
<b>Come in.</b>

11:37.960 --> 11:39.350
<b>Four-Eyes!</b>

11:45.230 --> 11:47.680
<b>Uh, sorry...</b>

11:53.110 --> 11:55.440
<b>An apology won't help!</b>

11:55.870 --> 11:57.440
<b>What were you thinking?!</b>

11:58.080 --> 12:01.060
<b>Didn't you see those who'd suffered 
the traditional <i>Nen</i> greeting?</b>

12:01.060 --> 12:03.830
<b>You could have ended up just like them!</b>

12:04.440 --> 12:06.750
<b>Oh, that's what I just told him.</b>

12:12.030 --> 12:13.370
<b>Honestly...</b>

12:13.370 --> 12:15.340
<b>I'm glad you weren't injured any worse.</b>

12:17.210 --> 12:20.340
<b>Wing-san, I really am sorry.</b>

12:21.760 --> 12:23.720
<b>No, I won't let this one slide.</b>

12:23.720 --> 12:24.990
<b>Killua-kun,</b>

12:24.990 --> 12:28.070
<b>do you know when Gon-kun will 
have recovered completely?</b>

12:28.070 --> 12:31.020
<b>The doctor said it would take two months.</b>

12:31.620 --> 12:33.020
<b>I understand.</b>

12:34.020 --> 12:35.810
<b><i>Thank you, Killua.</i></b>

12:35.810 --> 12:36.730
<b>In that case,</b>

12:37.090 --> 12:40.890
<b>I won't allow you to participate in 
any matches for two months!</b>

12:40.890 --> 12:45.240
<b>I won't allow you to train in,

12:45.690 --> 12:48.400
<b>If you don't abide by these rules,</b>

12:48.400 --> 12:51.270
<b>I will never teach you again.</b>

12:52.150 --> 12:53.240
<b>Well?</b>

12:53.670 --> 12:56.440
<b>I understand. I'll do as you say.</b>

12:57.490 --> 12:58.740
<b>Give me your left hand.</b>

13:02.140 --> 13:03.840
<b>This is a promise thread.</b>

13:04.560 --> 13:07.790
<b>It will be a visual reminder of your promise.</b>

13:10.050 --> 13:11.640
<b>Killua-kun, a moment, please.</b>

13:17.000 --> 13:18.270
<b>Killua-kun,</b>

13:18.270 --> 13:22.020
<b>what is the true objective 
you two are pursuing?</b>

13:22.020 --> 13:24.650
<b>Well, we don't really have an objective.</b>

13:25.210 --> 13:26.900
<b>Before running into Zushi and you,</b>

13:26.900 --> 13:29.160
<b>my plan was to earn some quick cash.</b>

13:29.820 --> 13:33.590
<b>Gon's here to train hard, 
so he can defeat a guy named Hisoka.</b>

13:33.590 --> 13:34.830
<b>That's it, really.</b>

13:36.160 --> 13:40.170
<b>Looks like the others in the 200s 
want to reach the top floor.</b>

13:40.840 --> 13:43.190
<b>Battle Olympia, was it?</b>

13:43.190 --> 13:44.930
<b>I'm not too interested.</b>

13:45.420 --> 13:47.780
<b>Oh, Gon is...</b>

13:47.780 --> 13:50.140
<b>Well, I'm not sure...</b>

13:51.070 --> 13:55.430
<b>He said that he only wants to fight Hisoka.</b>

13:55.810 --> 13:57.630
<b>But after seeing his match yesterday,</b>

13:58.300 --> 14:02.940
<b>I have a feeling he enjoys the thrills...</b>

14:10.370 --> 14:13.970
<b>How long will this exchange continue?</b>

14:13.970 --> 14:18.470
<b>There are nearly fifty tops flying 
around the ring!</b>

14:19.530 --> 14:24.120
<b>Gon is evading the frightening 
whirlwind of tops!</b>

14:24.120 --> 14:26.270
<b>Gido has used up all of his tops,</b>

14:26.270 --> 14:28.680
<b>and can only watch with the rest of us!</b>

14:33.280 --> 14:34.390
<b>Not that way!</b>

14:37.570 --> 14:40.650
<b><i>There's nowhere to run...</i></b>

14:47.320 --> 14:51.030
<b>You say that he was enjoying a situation</b>

14:51.030 --> 14:53.400
<b>that could have cost him his life?</b>

14:53.940 --> 14:54.890
<b>Yeah.</b>

14:54.890 --> 14:58.480
<b>I know because I've felt the same way.</b>

14:58.900 --> 15:01.540
<b>Although I take circumstances 
into consideration, too.</b>

15:02.470 --> 15:04.260
<b>Once he's in the zone,</b>

15:04.260 --> 15:06.210
<b>he loses sight of everything else.</b>

15:06.210 --> 15:06.960
<b>Oh!</b>

15:06.960 --> 15:10.800
<b>But he isn't the type to break a 
promise twice, so you needn't worry.</b>

15:11.890 --> 15:14.870
<b><i>Perhaps I have...</i></b>

15:15.560 --> 15:16.810
<b>It's too late.</b>

15:19.930 --> 15:23.560
<b>Because Gon and I already know.</b>

15:25.190 --> 15:27.870
<b>If you regret teaching us 
and decide to back out,</b>

15:27.870 --> 15:31.520
<b>we'll find someone else, 
or we'll learn it ourselves.</b>

15:32.890 --> 15:35.080
<b>You don't have to feel responsible.</b>

15:35.500 --> 15:39.280
<b>My brother and Hisoka can both use <i>Nen</i>,</b>

15:39.280 --> 15:42.520
<b>so Gon and I were bound to 
discover it eventually.</b>

15:45.340 --> 15:46.720
<b>I understand.</b>

15:46.720 --> 15:48.840
<b>And I mean to finish what I started.</b>

15:49.210 --> 15:52.340
<b>There are many things I must tell you.</b>

15:52.980 --> 15:55.090
<b>Zushi is waiting in my lodge.</b>

15:55.090 --> 15:57.490
<b>You can train with him.</b>

16:01.680 --> 16:03.370
<b>No, I'll pass.</b>

16:03.370 --> 16:04.360
<b>Huh?</b>

16:04.840 --> 16:07.110
<b>I won't leave Gon behind.</b>

16:07.900 --> 16:11.130
<b>If he keeps his promise, 
I'll start training when he does.</b>

16:13.790 --> 16:15.860
<b>Tell Gon-kun this...</b>

16:15.860 --> 16:18.620
<b>I will allow him to practice the other "Nen"!</b>

16:19.390 --> 16:21.900
<b>Tell him to practice "Ten" daily!</b>

16:41.380 --> 16:42.530
<b>Hey, Gon.</b>

17:24.860 --> 17:26.200
<b><i>Master...</i></b>

17:27.320 --> 17:29.780
<b><i>I may have</i></b>

17:30.960 --> 17:35.730
<b><i>awakened an incredible beast...</i></b>

17:50.790 --> 17:52.250
<b><i>Master?</i></b>

18:01.940 --> 18:03.650
<b>What do you mean?</b>

18:03.650 --> 18:06.390
<b>You found the agency on your own,</b>

18:06.390 --> 18:08.440
<b>so you must be sharp.</b>

18:09.100 --> 18:13.440
<b>But I can't recommend you to 
one of our valued clients.</b>

18:13.440 --> 18:16.640
<b>I have no problem with your lack of experience.</b>

18:16.640 --> 18:19.320
<b>Some clients don't mind greenhorns.</b>

18:19.320 --> 18:23.490
<b>But it isn't experience alone that you lack.</b>

18:23.490 --> 18:24.930
<b>What do you mean?</b>

18:24.930 --> 18:27.720
<b>I said that I have a Hunter License!</b>

18:27.720 --> 18:30.420
<b>But your exam hasn't ended yet.</b>

18:31.600 --> 18:33.210
<b>I can tell.</b>

18:34.030 --> 18:35.420
<b>What?</b>

18:36.560 --> 18:38.270
<b>Can you see anything?</b>

18:38.270 --> 18:39.220
<b>Eh?</b>

18:39.560 --> 18:41.710
<b>Next to me.</b>

18:47.020 --> 18:49.480
<b>You can't see a thing, right?</b>

18:52.750 --> 18:54.480
<b>Once you've learned to see,</b>

18:54.930 --> 18:56.280
<b>return.</b>

18:57.040 --> 18:59.540
<b>That's the bare minimum.</b>

19:03.370 --> 19:04.980
<b><i>What does she mean?</i></b>

19:05.590 --> 19:08.030
<b><i>What is it that I cannot see?</i></b>

19:59.180 --> 20:02.800
<b>You can't see it, but you can sense it.</b>

20:03.140 --> 20:04.520
<b>Why did you do that?!</b>

20:04.520 --> 20:05.780
<b>This?</b>

20:05.780 --> 20:08.350
<b>Well, I was just playing with you.</b>

20:09.210 --> 20:13.230
<b>Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.</b>

20:13.230 --> 20:17.570
<b>Consider this advice from a veteran...</b>

20:20.330 --> 20:22.780
<b>You didn't notice when I stole this,</b>

20:22.780 --> 20:27.080
<b>and you didn't notice when I walked past you.</b>

20:27.080 --> 20:30.830
<b>Bastard... Return my Hunter License!</b>

20:31.750 --> 20:34.130
<b>Can a newbie who knows nothing</b>

20:35.210 --> 20:37.340
<b>of <i>Nen</i> defeat me?</b>

20:37.340 --> 20:38.770
<b>Nen?</b>

20:44.550 --> 20:46.190
<b>Wanna give it a try?</b>

20:58.480 --> 21:00.100
<b>Understand now?</b>

21:00.100 --> 21:02.610
<b>You still lack something.</b>

21:06.620 --> 21:07.620
<b>I...</b>

21:09.460 --> 21:10.830
<b>I need...</b>

21:11.790 --> 21:14.710
<b>Enough power to fight on my own!</b>

21:21.570 --> 21:22.990
<b>Come with me.</b>

21:25.590 --> 21:27.210
<b>I'll be your teacher.</b>

21:30.150 --> 21:33.140
<b>The real exam has only just begun.</b>

21:39.450 --> 21:42.850
<b>Gon's hidden potential begins to awaken.</b>

21:43.640 --> 21:46.160
<b>And Kurapika has also encountered</b>

21:46.160 --> 21:49.780
<b>a new power that will help propel him forward.</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.190
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.190
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.190 --> 23:06.570
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:06.810 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.240 --> 23:09.610
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.280 --> 23:19.750
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.610 --> 23:11.960
<b>Today, we introduce the Hunter Agency!</b>

23:10.720 --> 23:13.160
<b>A place that helps Hunters 
find work.</b>

23:11.960 --> 23:14.500
<b>This place helps pro Hunters find work.</b>

23:13.160 --> 23:16.540
<b>The receptionist must be a 
<i>Nen</i> practitioner,</b>

23:14.500 --> 23:17.130
<b>It was hard to find the office Kurapika visited.</b>

23:16.540 --> 23:19.750
<b>who turns away those 
who can't use <i>Nen</i>.</b>

23:17.130 --> 23:18.700
<b>You must be able to find the agency</b>

23:18.700 --> 23:19.960
<b>before you qualify as a pro Hunter.</b>

23:24.630 --> 23:26.890
<b>Next time: Destiny x And x Tenacity!</b>

23:26.890 --> 23:29.110
<b>So who is Four-Eyes, anyway?</b>

23:29.110 --> 23:32.050
<b>Hmm, I wonder who the Floor Masters are.</b>

23:32.140 --> 23:34.620
<b>C-Could it be?</b>
