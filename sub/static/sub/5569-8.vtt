WEBVTT

00:02.937 --> 00:05.137
<i>Previously on</i> scream queens...
What took you so long?

00:05.139 --> 00:06.138
There were two devils.
<i>Dos diablos.</i>

00:06.140 --> 00:07.806
I can't live like this.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.942
Okay, all I do is
work out and kill people.

00:09.944 --> 00:12.277
(girls screaming)

00:12.279 --> 00:14.980
Pinky pledge that you
will be monogamous to me.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.149
Okay.
Oh, chad!

00:17.151 --> 00:19.018
I never take second place.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.919
I don't stop
till I get what I want.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.157
Man: Joaquin!
(woman calls out)

00:25.159 --> 00:26.725
Is that him?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.727
Damn straight
I'm out in public.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.963
I'm the master
of disguise, baby.

00:30.965 --> 00:33.399
Dude, dude, uh, uh,
<i>gladiator,</i> right?

00:33.401 --> 00:35.734
Like, "are you not entertained?"

00:35.736 --> 00:36.902
Right?
Yep.
Joaquin!

00:36.904 --> 00:38.237
Yeah, yeah, oh!

00:38.239 --> 00:39.571
I love him.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.306
Yeah, what?

00:41.308 --> 00:43.809
Yeah, no, no, everyone
thinks I'm joaquin phoenix.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.078
I-I just tell them it's part
of my performance art piece.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.414
Yeah, yeah, okay,
so we're agreed.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.816
We take gigi out tomorrow night.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.652
You come after boone,
and you best come correct.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.921
This has always been
about you and me.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.323
Have to talked to zayday lately?

00:58.325 --> 01:00.759
How is she?
Yeah, yeah.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.295
(grunting)

01:04.932 --> 01:07.499
Oh, my god.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.601
I got to call you back.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.537
Boone?
No.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.205
I'm joaquin phoenix.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.573
You're boone.
You were killed

01:14.575 --> 01:15.874
By the red devil,
which means...

01:15.876 --> 01:18.043
Fine, okay.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.845
You caught me.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.113
I'm...

01:21.115 --> 01:23.415
A ghost?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.584
Yeah.

01:25.586 --> 01:29.021
Yeah, I'm-I'm the ghost
of dead bo-o-one!

01:29.023 --> 01:30.456
And you've come back
to get revenge on me

01:30.458 --> 01:32.024
For saying you couldn't
be a pledge kappa.

01:32.026 --> 01:34.960
I'm so sorry
about that.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.428
Please don't kill me.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.763
I'm sort of gay now, too.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.465
Please...
(whimpering)

01:42.236 --> 01:43.368
Boo.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.838
(screams)

01:54.381 --> 01:56.748
Listen up, hog-faced sluts.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.218
Just because tonight's
our last night at kappa house

01:59.220 --> 02:00.953
Before we're forced
to evacuate campus,

02:00.955 --> 02:03.055
Doesn't mean you get
to mope around acting all sad!

02:03.057 --> 02:05.390
Why would we be sad?
This is a house of death.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.126
Six people have been
murdered here in a month.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.128
Now we finally get to leave.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.629
Why are you dressed like that?

02:10.631 --> 02:13.899
Well, einstein,
thanksgiving is next Thursday,

02:13.901 --> 02:15.767
And if any of you stupid whores
ever cracked a book

02:15.769 --> 02:18.770
Every now and again, you'd know
I'm dressed as sacagawea.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.272
She helped the pilgrims
with their first harvest

02:20.274 --> 02:22.774
On what is now known
as the first thanksgiving.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.776
No she didn't.
You're thinking of squanto.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.912
Um, no, squanto was friends
with the lone ranger.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.847
Sacagawea guided
the lewis and clark expedition.

02:28.849 --> 02:29.915
What? No way.

02:29.917 --> 02:30.949
Sacagawea taught the pilgrims

02:30.951 --> 02:32.084
How to make cranberry sauce

02:32.086 --> 02:33.185
And then, like, sang

02:33.187 --> 02:34.253
"blue corn moon"
or something.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.254
That was pocahontas.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.922
Damn it! Are you serious?

02:36.924 --> 02:38.624
I'm trying to impress
mr. And mrs. Radwell,

02:38.626 --> 02:40.759
And I just spent two hours
dressing up as the hag

02:40.761 --> 02:42.427
Who didn't realize
she was the third wheel

02:42.429 --> 02:44.930
On lewis and clark's
gay camping extravaganza?

02:44.932 --> 02:47.032
Wait, what?
You're meeting chad's parents?

02:47.034 --> 02:49.434
Oh, did I bury the lead?

02:49.436 --> 02:50.869
I must have forgotten
to tell you ladies

02:50.871 --> 02:52.304
About chad's proposal.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.372
What?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.873
Proposal?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.441
That's right,
chad and I were enjoying

02:56.443 --> 02:58.377
A very romantic
compliment night.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.145
You're so hot you give
my bone a bone.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.047
Thank you
for that compliment, chad.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.615
Whew! Chanel?

03:03.617 --> 03:05.184
You know how you've been
talking about taking

03:05.186 --> 03:07.352
Our relationship
to the next level?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.521
Whew!
(gasps)

03:09.523 --> 03:11.223
Oh, my god,
this is happening!

03:11.225 --> 03:12.457
This is really
happening!

03:12.459 --> 03:14.626
Chanel oberlin, will you...

03:14.628 --> 03:16.562
Accept this silver
turkey wishbone necklace

03:16.564 --> 03:19.464
And accompany me to the hamptons
to spend thanksgiving

03:19.466 --> 03:20.699
At the radwell family compound?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.167
You're gonna meet
my mom, my dad,

03:22.169 --> 03:23.335
My brothers
thad and brad.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.671
My house-- awesome!

03:25.673 --> 03:27.406
It's on an 50,000-acre
cranberry orchard

03:27.408 --> 03:29.675
That my great-great-great-great
grandfather prentice radwell

03:29.677 --> 03:33.045
Bought off the shinnecock
indians for six glass beads.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.414
Wait, that's what
he proposed?

03:35.416 --> 03:36.582
A trip to his compound?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.417
Uh, sorry if you're jealous,

03:38.419 --> 03:40.185
Bitches, but every girl
that's gotten

03:40.187 --> 03:42.254
A radwell silver turkey
wishbone necklace

03:42.256 --> 03:44.089
Has gotten an engagement ring
by christmas.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.658
Except for one girl, I guess...

03:46.660 --> 03:49.895
Yeah, her name was debbie
and she and thad were dating,

03:49.897 --> 03:52.764
But he didn't give her a silver
turkey wishbone necklace,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.366
So she was not invited
to thanksgiving,

03:54.368 --> 03:57.169
But showed up anyway
and hung herself in the orchard,

03:57.171 --> 03:59.538
And, uh, now the whole house
is haunted.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.240
Oh.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.175
Yeah, like, you know,
like, the furniture

04:03.177 --> 04:06.178
Just starts screaming,
or, like, you'll crack open

04:06.180 --> 04:07.746
A mountain dew
and you'll start to drink it

04:07.748 --> 04:10.849
And then it'll
just turn to blood.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.918
We're gonna have,
like, the dopest time.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.053
So let's all raise
a glass to me.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.256
The radwells are
the perfect american family.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.724
And chad wants me
to become a part of it.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.525
So I actually don't care
that tonight's

04:20.527 --> 04:22.427
The last night of kappa
kappa tau, because I have

04:22.429 --> 04:24.096
Successfully
used this sorority

04:24.098 --> 04:26.398
For its proper,
god-given purpose.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.735
To be part of a sisterhood
and make lifelong friends.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.603
Ew, no, for making me
popular enough

04:31.605 --> 04:33.138
To get a hot, rich husband.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.374
Guys, both our families
are loaded.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.643
I am about to be,
like, super rich.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.144
Not if the ghost
murders you first.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.246
Or follows you home
and murders you here.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.148
Or if you get
murdered tonight because

04:43.150 --> 04:44.750
It's the last night
of kappa kappa tau and it seems

04:44.752 --> 04:46.551
Highly likely that
the killer will come after us.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.820
Like I said--
a toast... To chanel.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.589
Kappa!

04:50.591 --> 04:52.157
Group: Kappa.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.661
You're not finished
packing yet?

04:55.663 --> 04:57.663
I was sure miss type-a
would've had it done by now.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.064
I was actually thinking

04:59.066 --> 05:00.565
I might just
hang back on campus

05:00.567 --> 05:02.100
For a couple of days.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.935
You know, maybe take
advantage of the quiet,

05:03.937 --> 05:05.270
Do some more investigating.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.638
Pete said he'd stay with me.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.106
I bet he did.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.808
But no way I'm gonna
let you be the only

05:09.810 --> 05:12.077
Box of macaroni left
in the red devil's cupboard.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.079
Your dad won't, either.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.447
To hell with my dad.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.915
Zaday, he lied to me

05:16.917 --> 05:18.984
About the most important
thing in my life--

05:18.986 --> 05:21.787
Who I am,
where I come from.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.422
And now he wants me
to just forget it

05:23.424 --> 05:25.490
And spend thanksgiving with him
and that psycho gigi

05:25.492 --> 05:27.125
And her weird recipes?

05:27.127 --> 05:29.227
No way.
I'd rather stay here.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.931
The campus
is shutting down.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.933
If you want to figure
all this out,

05:34.935 --> 05:37.169
You can do it from the safety
of my grandma's house.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.938
You can't spend
thanksgiving alone.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.440
And if you're sure
you want to punish your dad

05:41.442 --> 05:42.774
And blow him off,

05:42.776 --> 05:44.509
Then you can come with me

05:44.511 --> 05:46.712
And have o-town thanksgiving
with me and all my cousins.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.816
Oh, I am so glad

05:50.818 --> 05:52.484
Neither of us
have been killed.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.619
Aw, that's so sweet.
Me, too.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.221
Now let's finish packing.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.690
Ah, okay.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.800
I don't understand
why you're making us

06:08.802 --> 06:10.469
Bubble wrap
each item of clothing.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.703
Are you kidding me?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.205
How much did this dress cost?

06:13.207 --> 06:14.840
$63,000.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.241
Uh, yeah, okay.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.477
When something costs $63,000,

06:18.479 --> 06:20.679
You wrap it in bubble wrap.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.181
Besides, bubble wrap is fun.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.516
Mmm...
I think because

06:24.518 --> 06:25.984
I'm not allowed
to carry a firearm,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.753
I like to pop
the little bubbles,

06:27.755 --> 06:30.422
And then pretend like
my finger is a gun.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.860
(scream echoes)

06:34.862 --> 06:36.595
Okay, sorry,

06:36.597 --> 06:38.764
I can't keep this
a secret any longer.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.433
I am personally
being haunted by a ghost.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.268
What?
You heard me.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.170
Late last night
I was walking around campus,

06:45.172 --> 06:47.105
And I saw the
ghost of dead gay boone.

06:47.107 --> 06:50.942
The ghost of dead gay boone
is walking the earth.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.845
We had, like,
a full conversation.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.347
(laughs)
that is so stupid.

06:55.349 --> 06:57.048
Because ghosts
don't exist.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.417
Oh, really?

06:58.419 --> 07:00.285
Then why won't
my hands stop shaking?

07:00.287 --> 07:02.921
Because you're hungover.
Of course I'm hungover.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.923
You know why I had
to get hammered last night?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.259
Because I saw the ghost
of dead gay boone!

07:07.261 --> 07:10.395
Wait, you-you-you
seriously saw a ghost?

07:10.397 --> 07:11.563
Yes.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.466
It was... Terrifying.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.735
Ooh, that is creepy.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.770
Being haunted by a ghost

07:18.772 --> 07:20.272
Who's stalking the campus

07:20.274 --> 07:22.774
On your last night
at kappa house,

07:22.776 --> 07:26.244
The night all of you
are most likely

07:26.246 --> 07:27.712
To be murdered.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.381
Put down the bubble wrap down.

07:29.383 --> 07:31.216
Let's gather
round the fireplace.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.884
Come on, children.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.220
(quietly):
No...

07:35.222 --> 07:37.756
Momma denise is about to scare

07:37.758 --> 07:40.292
The living bejeezus
out of you

07:40.294 --> 07:41.893
With some real scary
ghost stories.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.228
Wait, what?

07:43.230 --> 07:44.396
No, please.

07:44.398 --> 07:45.630
We're already terrified.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.098
Exactly.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.767
See, when I get scared,

07:48.769 --> 07:51.903
And I feel like, like isis

07:51.905 --> 07:53.405
Done broke in my house,

07:53.407 --> 07:54.906
I tell myself

07:54.908 --> 07:57.275
Real scary ghost stories.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.443
And then my fear of the isis

07:58.445 --> 08:00.679
Is replaced and I'm scared

08:00.681 --> 08:03.114
Of the candyman,

08:03.116 --> 08:04.649
Who returns
from the dead

08:04.651 --> 08:06.818
When you say
his name five times.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.420
Candyman, candyman...

08:08.422 --> 08:09.988
(quietly):
Candyman, candyman, candyman...

08:09.990 --> 08:11.957
Or the hitchhiking old lady

08:11.959 --> 08:14.693
With the hairy arms

08:14.695 --> 08:17.162
Just like hers,
who disappears

08:17.164 --> 08:18.697
When you stop for gas.

08:18.699 --> 08:22.200
But there's a butcher knife
in her purse,

08:22.202 --> 08:23.668
Except you didn't see it
the first time,

08:23.670 --> 08:24.970
'cause when you checked,

08:24.972 --> 08:26.438
Wasn't nothing in there

08:26.440 --> 08:28.440
But knitting materials.

08:28.442 --> 08:30.141
And then there's

08:30.143 --> 08:33.778
A japanese ghost story
called "the kappa."

08:33.780 --> 08:35.447
There is not! Come on!

08:35.449 --> 08:37.015
Denise:
Oh, yes there is.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.016
Look it up.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.285
Them japanese got

08:40.287 --> 08:41.786
All manner of weird-ass
ghost stories.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.655
And the one about the kappa

08:43.657 --> 08:46.558
Is the creepiest of all.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.894
They live in the sewer.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.829
(eerie laughter, echoing)

08:50.831 --> 08:54.733
<i>And they just</i>
<i>waiting for you</i>

08:54.735 --> 08:58.136
<i>To sit your ass on the toilet,</i>

08:58.138 --> 09:00.405
<i>So they can reach up</i>
<i>and grab your ass,</i>

09:00.407 --> 09:02.240
<i>Snatch you by the vagina and--</i>

09:02.242 --> 09:03.742
(screams)

09:03.744 --> 09:07.646
And drown your crushed body
in raw sewage.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.249
The... End.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.252
I, for one, loved that.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.420
See?

09:15.422 --> 09:17.355
I know y'all
feel better now!

09:17.357 --> 09:19.190
Now you're scared
of the kappa.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.759
You're not even thinking
about the serial killer

09:20.761 --> 09:23.395
On campus or the ghost
that's stalking you.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.496
Yes, we are!

09:24.498 --> 09:25.997
That story just made it worse!

09:25.999 --> 09:28.400
Okay, okay, okay.
I hear you.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.902
Momma denise knows
you're still scared.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.673
So you just might need
another ghost story.

09:34.675 --> 09:35.907
No!

09:35.909 --> 09:37.409
This japanese ghost story

09:37.411 --> 09:40.745
Is called "the red cloak."

09:40.747 --> 09:42.380
And it's about a ghost

09:42.382 --> 09:43.915
Who lurks
in women's bathrooms.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.250
What?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.752
Why another story
about a bathroom?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.154
I'm just telling the story.

09:51.058 --> 09:54.092
<i>The red cloak waits until</i>
<i>you run out of toilet paper.</i>

09:54.094 --> 09:57.095
<i>And then he makes you choose</i>

09:57.097 --> 09:59.731
<i>The red roll</i>

09:59.733 --> 10:02.167
<i>Or the blue roll.</i>

10:08.809 --> 10:11.042
(water splashing, door slams)

10:11.044 --> 10:12.577
If you pick the red roll,

10:12.579 --> 10:14.412
He'll slit your throat!

10:14.414 --> 10:16.147
<i>And the blood will run up,</i>

10:16.149 --> 10:19.150
<i>And look like you're</i>
<i>wearing a red cloak.</i>

10:19.152 --> 10:20.919
But if you pick the blue roll,

10:20.921 --> 10:23.822
He will strangle you

10:23.824 --> 10:26.157
<i>Until you turn blue.</i>

10:26.159 --> 10:29.094
<i>And it'll look like</i>
<i>you're wearing a blue cloak.</i>

10:29.096 --> 10:31.162
The... End.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.599
I know y'all feel better now.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.735
No, we don't.
No more ghost stories!

10:36.737 --> 10:38.737
Or at least stop
setting them in bathrooms!

10:38.739 --> 10:39.738
Chanel:
I really have to pee.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.272
But there is no way

10:41.274 --> 10:42.941
I'm going anywhere
near a toilet.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.776
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go look

10:44.778 --> 10:48.480
For a salad bowl to squat over
under the stairwell.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.482
(sobbing)

10:54.254 --> 10:57.922
Does somebody need
another ghost story

10:57.924 --> 11:00.692
To scare away
the heebie-jeebies?

11:00.694 --> 11:03.795
Yes, I'm really enjoying myself.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.597
<i>(vacuum sealer buzzes)</i>

11:05.599 --> 11:07.399
(buzzing)

11:09.102 --> 11:11.469
(air hissing)

11:11.471 --> 11:13.538
(door creaking)

11:16.476 --> 11:17.842
(buzzing stops)

11:18.779 --> 11:20.345
Hey, chad.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.113
(sighs)
so it's true.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.949
You<i> have</i> come back to haunt us.

11:24.951 --> 11:27.152
Listen, you probably
already know this

11:27.154 --> 11:29.888
Because you saw it from heaven,
but I kind of had sex

11:29.890 --> 11:32.390
With a few girls in your bed
after you died.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.659
I didn't mean any disrespect,
just kind of wanted

11:34.661 --> 11:36.461
That feeling
of vacation sex, you know?

11:41.001 --> 11:43.234
And I love the haircut.
Thank you. Nice.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.970
Dude, you are so warm--
I thought ghosts were cold or...

11:45.972 --> 11:49.407
Vapor or something.
Everything you think you know
about ghosts is a lie, chad.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.143
Ghosts walk among you every day;
you would never know it.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.146
Only us ghosts know who
is a ghost and who isn't.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.181
(whispers):
Of course.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.816
But why are you back?
I mean,

11:57.818 --> 11:59.417
I'm super stoked you're here,
it's just so much

11:59.419 --> 12:01.019
Has gone on
since you killed yourself.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.687
I mean, I had sex
with that security guard.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.489
That neck brace girl.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.391
Took off the neck brace--
got hot, like, overnight.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.693
Caulfield... (whispers):
He got his arms chopped off,

12:08.695 --> 12:10.028
Then his head.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.564
Aw.
Both the twins
are dead.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.199
Just wasn't the same
without you here, though, bro.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.234
(sighs) I've come back
for the same reason

12:16.236 --> 12:19.337
All ghosts come back: To finish
some unfinished business.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.538
Which is why
I'm here.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.307
I need to borrow
your "date shirt."

12:23.877 --> 12:26.244
My "sure thing oxford"? Why?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.680
I've come back to take zayday
williams on a really nice,

12:28.682 --> 12:30.215
Expensive date
that will totally impress her.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.416
Hold up.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.585
You know
zayday's a chick, right?

12:33.587 --> 12:35.420
Boone...

12:35.422 --> 12:37.789
Did you forget you're super gay?

12:37.791 --> 12:40.291
(chuckles):
Um, yeah.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.026
But I don't want
to be dead anymore, bro.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.095
Look, if I can get
zayday to love me

12:44.097 --> 12:46.631
And have sex with me,
I can stay on earth.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.300
Wait, how does that work?
Haven't you ever heard
the phrase,

12:49.302 --> 12:51.202
"once you go black,
you never go back"?

12:51.204 --> 12:54.706
Yeah.
That's how it started.

12:54.708 --> 12:57.075
Yes, boone! Of course, man!
I want you here.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.109
I want you back

12:58.111 --> 12:59.744
In the world of the living, man.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.446
(grunts)

13:01.448 --> 13:04.449
You do know that zayday is
dating earl grey, though, right?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.084
I wouldn't worry about that.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.186
I'll talk to him,
straighten him right out.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.765
Ooh, ooh...

13:20.767 --> 13:23.067
Hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.836
Whew!

13:30.277 --> 13:32.343
Oh, no!

13:34.848 --> 13:37.182
(whispers):
Which one do I choose?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.249
(creaking)

13:44.758 --> 13:47.258
(panting)

13:52.098 --> 13:54.265
(screams)

13:54.267 --> 13:56.367
(gasping, grunting)

13:56.369 --> 13:58.136
(choking, coughing)

13:58.138 --> 14:00.271
(grunting, gasping)

14:07.981 --> 14:09.814
(screams)

14:09.816 --> 14:11.950
(gasping): No!

14:11.952 --> 14:13.785
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

14:13.787 --> 14:16.020
I just got my hair done!

14:16.022 --> 14:17.522
(grunts)

14:18.725 --> 14:20.058
(flushing)

14:20.060 --> 14:21.860
(screaming)

14:22.996 --> 14:25.230
(gasping breaths)

14:28.702 --> 14:30.401
(whimpering)

14:35.809 --> 14:37.709
The killer just attacked me
in the bathroom.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.477
We have to get out of here!
We ain't goin' nowhere!

14:39.479 --> 14:40.478
Not until

14:40.480 --> 14:42.380
I hear another ghost story.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.681
If I don't hear
another ghost story

14:43.683 --> 14:45.016
Right now, I might just have

14:45.018 --> 14:46.718
A stroke!
But if we stay
in here,

14:46.720 --> 14:49.487
Then the killer could come in
and chop off your head!

14:49.489 --> 14:53.024
(chuckles): Well... That's just
a chance I'm willing to take.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.759
Nope, we ain't

14:54.761 --> 14:56.194
Goin' nowhere. Besides,

14:56.196 --> 14:57.161
Denise hemphill

14:57.163 --> 14:58.563
Is not gonna make it down

14:58.565 --> 15:00.531
That crazy,
overly dramatic staircase

15:00.533 --> 15:02.734
Without having
a damn heart attack!

15:02.736 --> 15:04.402
Will someone please
just tell a scary story

15:04.404 --> 15:06.070
So we can get out of here?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.572
Okay. Fine.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.073
I have one.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.942
Let's all sit
by the fireplace.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.546
It happened

15:15.548 --> 15:17.081
In the 1950s.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.751
A sorority sister was
returning to campus

15:19.753 --> 15:22.553
After getting her license
for the first time.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.756
<i>She was supposed</i>
<i>to leave at lunchtime,</i>

15:24.758 --> 15:27.926
<i>But she got delayed</i>
<i>at a weenie roast or sock hop,</i>

15:27.928 --> 15:31.696
When suddenly,
she found herself on the road

15:31.698 --> 15:34.065

16:32.425 --> 16:34.759

Her car.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.594
There's someone
in the back seat of her car.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.929
He was gonna
kill her.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.979
(chanel #5 screaming)

16:54.981 --> 16:57.849
I don't understand-- if he
escaped a mental institution

16:57.851 --> 16:59.283
In the middle of the night,

16:59.285 --> 17:01.452
Then where did he get
a meat hook from?

17:01.454 --> 17:02.653
'cause he's
the meat hook killer.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.955
The story would suck

17:03.957 --> 17:05.556
If there wasn't
a meat hook in it.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.225
Denise:
Let me just say that

17:07.227 --> 17:08.659
That scares me but good.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.361
I feel my blood pressure
coming down,

17:10.363 --> 17:11.829
And I'm not gassy no more.

17:11.831 --> 17:12.730
(chuckles)

17:12.732 --> 17:14.198
We can all leave now.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.000
The killer
could still be out there!

17:16.002 --> 17:17.535
Well, he's probably gone by now.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.203
Exactly like we should all be.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.205
I mean, if we've learned
anything from all of this,

17:21.207 --> 17:23.975
It's that he's crazier than us
<i>and</i> smarter than us.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.643
And even though we
seem unwilling to do

17:25.645 --> 17:27.078
Whatever it takes
to survive,

17:27.080 --> 17:28.679
He's not gonna stop
until all of us are dead.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.248
He is the predator,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.517
And we... Are the prey.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.052
The only way
to stop the killings...

17:34.054 --> 17:36.554
Cut off his food supply.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.890
Wait... When did he
start eating us?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.358
Yeah.
Well, you know,

17:40.360 --> 17:42.593
You guys are more than welcome
to stay here

17:42.595 --> 17:45.830
And be the next on his
list, but I am leaving
campus immediately.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.331
(sighs)

My sensual massage oils,
a bottle of champagne,

Boyfriend material.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.763
So listen, the afterlife

19:25.765 --> 19:27.465
Is kind of a weird place.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.267

if you know this

19:30.837 --> 19:33.004
I was a pretty amazing person
when I was alive.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.106
And because of that,
when I got to heaven

19:35.108 --> 19:37.275
They offered me whatever
I wanted-- but I said

19:37.277 --> 19:38.976
What I want
more than anything...

19:38.978 --> 19:42.180
Is to come back down to earth,
as a ghost...

19:42.182 --> 19:44.615
And make sweet love
to zayday williams.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.017
A couple times.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.853

for a little while.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.721

Wait. This all makes sense--
of course you would fake

20:07.473 --> 20:10.074
Your own death--
so no one would suspect you.

with the neckbrace?

24:18.758 --> 24:20.591
My spinal column was collapsing,

24:20.593 --> 24:22.726
So I decided to bedazzle my
neckbrace and put it back on.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.595

person to even notice

24:24.597 --> 24:26.430

my question.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.771
What, as to why
I'm inviting chanel

24:33.773 --> 24:35.206
To radwell thanksgiving
and not you?

24:36.476 --> 24:38.108
Okay, let me see
if I can explain this

24:38.110 --> 24:40.644
To someone who's
a) not a psychology major

24:40.646 --> 24:42.446
And b) clearly doesn't
get the fact

24:42.448 --> 24:43.914
That I've obviously been
ignoring you.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.583
Okay, here are
the top five reasons

24:45.585 --> 24:47.351
I'm not inviting you
to thanksgiving:

24:47.353 --> 24:48.686
Reason number one.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.954
Last time we porked,

24:49.956 --> 24:51.755
I heard a tiny
little squeal

24:51.757 --> 24:53.924
Like somebody letting air
out of a balloon

24:53.926 --> 24:55.593
Followed by the smell of death.

24:56.429 --> 24:57.595
I feel like you farted.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.697
Reason number two.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.532
You wear a huge flippin'
neckbrace.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.501
That means
you've got bum genes

25:03.503 --> 25:05.836
And those bum genes would
pollute the radwell gene pool.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.304
Reason number three.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.006
Your breath,
it always smells like you just

25:09.008 --> 25:10.441
Ate a cheeseburger.
Seriously,

25:10.443 --> 25:11.642
It's like making out
with the hamburglar.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.210
Reason number four.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.479
You, my friend,
have a poo belly.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.348
Might have something to do
with all the cheeseburgers.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.383
Reason number five.

25:19.385 --> 25:21.318
Uh, this just in...
You're not rich

25:21.320 --> 25:23.454
And chanel is loaded.

25:23.456 --> 25:25.222
So, huh, doi, neckbrace,

25:25.224 --> 25:27.391
That's who I'm bringing home
to meet my parents.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.959
Well...

25:30.696 --> 25:32.563
I guess we'll just have to see
how it goes

25:32.565 --> 25:35.132
Bringing chanel home
for thanksgiving.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.167
Yeah, I guess we will see,

25:37.169 --> 25:38.802
As that's what's going
to happen.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.304
I guess we'll just have
to wait and see.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.072
Yeah, we will wait and see,

25:42.074 --> 25:43.841
As thanksgiving is an event
that takes place in the future

25:43.843 --> 25:45.476
And therefore
it hasn't happened yet.

25:45.478 --> 25:46.677
We'll see.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.145
Yep, sure will.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.813
As the arrow of time
flows in one direction,

25:49.815 --> 25:51.916
Causing future events to flow
inexorably towards us.

25:51.918 --> 25:52.917
(blows)

25:52.919 --> 25:54.018
Wh...

25:54.020 --> 25:55.319
Okay, just so we're clear,

25:55.321 --> 25:57.988
I only caught this kiss...

25:57.990 --> 25:59.423
So I could throw it away.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.065
(vacuum sealer buzzing)

26:08.067 --> 26:10.568
I can't do this.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.337
I can't believe it.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.239
Earl grey is dead.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.741
It had to be boone
who killed him.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.209
You know what I can't believe?!

26:19.211 --> 26:21.078
I cannot believe that no one
is comforting me

26:21.080 --> 26:23.714
After I was almost murdered
by the red devil,

26:23.716 --> 26:24.915
Who was in the back seat
of my car

26:24.917 --> 26:26.584
And then barely escaped

26:26.586 --> 26:29.086
As some poor old
truck driver

26:29.088 --> 26:30.421
Was hacked to death
with a machete!

26:30.423 --> 26:31.922
And then, you know,

26:31.924 --> 26:33.591
I thought I'd at least
get some props

26:33.593 --> 26:36.527
For coming back with such
an amazing scary story.

26:36.529 --> 26:38.028
Chanel:
Actually, number five,

26:38.030 --> 26:40.197
That story is neither scary
nor amazing.

26:40.199 --> 26:43.200
That story is an exact facsimile
of the hook hand story

26:43.202 --> 26:44.602
Hester told about an hour ago.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.370
Honestly, if you're going
to get attacked,

26:46.372 --> 26:48.906
Please attempt to get attacked
in a fresh, exciting way.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.241
We have to concentrate--
the pieces of this puzzle

26:51.243 --> 26:52.743
Are coming together.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.812
Yes, we know now that
boone is the red devil.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.714
There's more than one
red devil, moron.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.382
Well, now we know boone
is one of them.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.484
Which means he's probably
the baby in the bathtub.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.252
Zayday:
We should call the police.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.154
They've got to find him.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.923
Grace:
Already did. The police put out
an all-points bulletin

27:05.925 --> 27:08.325
And denise is aiding
the manhunt.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.760
The police aren't going
to help us.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.996
You can't stop a ghost.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.163
Oh, my god,

27:13.165 --> 27:14.598
I'm so freaked out.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.766
Will someone please
tell a ghost story?

27:15.768 --> 27:17.167
Hester:
I have a ghost story.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.602
It's a good one.

27:18.604 --> 27:21.338
It's about a girl
who never fit in.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.940
As much as she tried
to be popular,

27:22.942 --> 27:24.942
The mean girls were always
trying to tear her down.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.277
They could never see past
her neckbrace.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.647
She soon realized
the only way to get back

27:29.649 --> 27:31.782
At these girls would be
to screw chanel's boyfriend,

27:31.784 --> 27:36.086
Chad radwell,
and wreak ultimate vengeance.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.922
What?
That's right, chanel,

27:38.924 --> 27:40.257
Her name is me.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.326
And guess what, bitch,
I'm pregnant!

27:43.929 --> 27:45.763
This is insane.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.264
Looks like I'll be going
to the hamptons

27:47.266 --> 27:49.099
For thanksgiving
with the radwells.

27:49.101 --> 27:52.569
(quietly):
Guess who's top bitch
on campus now, chanel?

27:54.940 --> 27:57.408
(creaking)

27:59.612 --> 28:01.345
Are you still packing?

28:01.347 --> 28:03.681
Uh, excuse me for taking pride
in a quality pack job, chanel.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.649
Packing matters to me.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.851
That's why I chose to minor
in luggage sciences

28:07.853 --> 28:09.687
With an emphasis
in packing theory.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.722
Is it true about hester?

28:16.295 --> 28:17.594
She's pregnant.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.032
(sighs heavily)

28:22.034 --> 28:24.034
(quietly):
Oh, man.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.303
Oh, no.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.239
Oh...

28:29.241 --> 28:31.408
I really screwed up.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.143
So it's true?

28:33.145 --> 28:35.212
(chad sighs)

28:35.214 --> 28:37.147
I guess so.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.516
I mean, most of the time
we porked in a way

28:39.518 --> 28:41.385
That could not result
in pregnancy,

28:41.387 --> 28:42.720
If you know what I mean.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.489
(sighs)

28:45.491 --> 28:48.325
But I always knew I had
a sackful of strong swimmers.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.494
Chad.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.362
I'm sorry, chanel.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.565
Look, I'm as pissed off
about this as you are.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.334
That hester chick
is weird.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.337
Tossing her the bone
was not even all that fun.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.940
But I guess
I got to marry her now.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.743
Take her home to thanksgiving.

29:05.745 --> 29:06.744
Wait, what?!

29:06.746 --> 29:08.078
I'm sorry, chanel,

29:08.080 --> 29:09.546
That's just how
the radwells roll.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.181
We make our beds
and we lie in them.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.251
We lie in them
with our

29:14.253 --> 29:16.820
Creepy neckbraced
scoliosis wives.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.424
But look...

29:20.426 --> 29:23.060
You could still be
my piece on the side.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.629
No, this is not happening!

29:25.631 --> 29:27.264
I will not tolerate
being treated this way,

29:27.266 --> 29:29.066
Do you understand?

29:29.068 --> 29:30.601
This is the last straw.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.069
I'm sorry, chanel. I am.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.605
I-I... I just don't get
what you want me to do.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.739
I want you to pay.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.908
Okay, uh, hold on. What?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.543
You heard me.

29:39.545 --> 29:42.045
You are gonna pay, big-time,
for this, chad radwell.

29:42.047 --> 29:44.581
You might even just pay
the ultimate price.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.917
Ultimate...?
Wait, hold up.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.318
Did you just threaten
to kill me?

29:51.590 --> 29:54.324
Chanel, are you the killer?

29:55.561 --> 29:57.828
I guess we'll see.

30:06.605 --> 30:07.971
Chanel #3, #5?

30:07.973 --> 30:10.307
I owe you both the most
heartfelt of apologies.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.575
Remember when I said
that the only thing

30:11.577 --> 30:13.110
A sorority's ever been good for

30:13.112 --> 30:14.678
Is scoring a hot, rich husband?

30:14.680 --> 30:17.080
Well, I have never been
so wrong.

30:17.082 --> 30:19.283
Kappa house is,
and always has been,

30:19.285 --> 30:21.585
First and foremost,
a sisterhood

30:21.587 --> 30:23.086
And I have never needed
my sisters

30:23.088 --> 30:24.354
More than I need them now.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.089
Yeah, okay, apology accepted.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.691
Hold on.

30:27.693 --> 30:30.794
I am not just going to accept
any old apology, chanel.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.930
I mean, you treat me
like garbage every single day.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.432
Am I just supposed to ignore
the obvious fact

30:35.434 --> 30:37.100
That you hate me
and love nothing more

30:37.102 --> 30:39.436
Than playing super-humiliating
pranks on me?

30:39.438 --> 30:41.772
Why do you always have to make
everything about you?

30:41.774 --> 30:43.040
Like, remember that one time

30:43.042 --> 30:44.274
When you hacked into
my mom's e-mail

30:44.276 --> 30:45.542
And wrote me
this really long letter

30:45.544 --> 30:46.944
Explaining how I was adopted

30:46.946 --> 30:49.780
And born with
fetal alcohol syndrome

30:49.782 --> 30:52.216
And therefore, had an iq
in the low 60s?

30:52.218 --> 30:54.484
I'm sorry,
but that was hilarious.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.353
I stand by that prank.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.122
Look, number five, sisters
don't always get along,

30:59.124 --> 31:00.724
But that doesn't mean
they're not sisters.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.059
Chanel:
See? Exactly.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.061
Thank you, number three.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.063
Okay, now that we're
a sisterhood again,

31:06.065 --> 31:08.799
We have to figure out a way
to get rid of chanel #6.

31:08.801 --> 31:10.300
When you say
get rid of her,

31:10.302 --> 31:11.702
Do you mean, like,
force her to leave,

31:11.704 --> 31:13.170
Or kill her?

31:13.172 --> 31:16.206
Honestly, number five,
do you think I'm insane?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.075
The bitch seduced my boyfriend
into getting her pregnant.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.010
Of course I mean kill her.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.212
Chanel, you cannot just run
around murdering people.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.147
Okay? That just means
you're the killer.

31:24.149 --> 31:26.016
It makes her<i> a</i> killer,
not<i> the</i> killer.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.517
What?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.686
Okay, I just-I just
don't understand

31:29.688 --> 31:31.922
What killing number six
is going to solve.

31:31.924 --> 31:34.358
Um, hello! Everything?

31:34.360 --> 31:37.094
Number six will be dead,
I'll get back my invite

31:37.096 --> 31:39.730
To thanksgiving at the radwell
family compound in the hamptons,

31:39.732 --> 31:41.865
And I'll be back on track
to getting the only thing

31:41.867 --> 31:43.600
A sorority's ever been
good for--

31:43.602 --> 31:45.669
Scoring a hot husband with
an enormous family fortune.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.371
Wait, you just said
that you don't care

31:47.373 --> 31:49.039
About any of those things
and the only thing

31:49.041 --> 31:50.741
That really mattered
to you was sisterhood.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.509
Yeah. That was when
I thought I had taken

31:52.511 --> 31:54.778
Our lifelong friendship for
granted and had lost it forever.

31:54.780 --> 31:57.180
But now that I see
we're stronger than ever,

31:57.182 --> 31:59.016
I.E. Planning
a murder together,

31:59.018 --> 32:01.218
I can concentrate on the things
I care way, way, way more about

32:01.220 --> 32:03.754
Than sisterhood, e.G.
Hot husband, extreme wealth,

32:03.756 --> 32:05.522
Et cetera, et cetera.
Try to keep up.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.090
The logic's not
that complicated.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.425
Now, come on-- murder,

32:08.427 --> 32:09.826
Ideas, go.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.397
I understand
that you're very upset,

32:13.399 --> 32:15.933
But this is a critical time
in our investigation.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.869
Now, deidre is the best
sketch artist in the business.

32:18.871 --> 32:20.904
So, if you can just
close your eyes

32:20.906 --> 32:22.806
And do your best
to describe boone,

32:22.808 --> 32:25.709
We can get a drawing of
the suspect out on the news.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.478
You already have, like,
50 photos of him!

32:28.480 --> 32:29.546
Oh, dear god.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.915
Boone faked his own death.

32:31.917 --> 32:35.819
He has been walking around
campus in a disguise for weeks.

32:35.821 --> 32:38.388
He's murdered 13 people.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.391
We need to call, like,
the fbi or something because

32:41.393 --> 32:44.094
This is clearly out of your
capacity as a detective.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.096
I happen to agree with you.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.065
Which is why I've asked
paul cameron

32:48.067 --> 32:49.833
To come assist
with this investigation.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.601
I'm the founder
of an organization

32:51.603 --> 32:54.838
Called the department of
paranormal exploration or dope.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.606
Chisolm:
I feel it may be time
to let you ladies in

32:56.608 --> 32:57.741
On a little secret.

32:58.911 --> 33:00.610
Since these killings began,

33:00.612 --> 33:03.113
I have focused my investigation
on a single theory--

33:03.115 --> 33:05.916
That the perpetrator
of these murders

33:05.918 --> 33:07.751
Was not being caught...

33:07.753 --> 33:09.753
Because he's a ghost.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.588
Oh, my god.
Now, these
recent developments

33:11.590 --> 33:13.623
Have proven,
much to my horror,

33:13.625 --> 33:15.592
That I am right.
If I may,

33:15.594 --> 33:17.928
I'd like to set up
some of my equipment

33:17.930 --> 33:20.430
To get some
electromagnetic field readings.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.600
Maybe see if the microphones
pick up any ghost chatter.

33:23.602 --> 33:24.768
Now, I must warn you,

33:24.770 --> 33:26.103
If your boyfriend

33:26.105 --> 33:28.338
Was murdered,
he may not be ready

33:28.340 --> 33:30.774
To pass over, and may
come pay you a visitation.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.976
If that happens,

33:32.978 --> 33:36.146
I beg of you,
do not have sex with him.

33:36.148 --> 33:40.317
What is wrong with you?
He's the best in the business.

33:40.319 --> 33:43.653
He had a callback for that
show on the syfy channel

33:43.655 --> 33:46.223
Where they run around
with the night vision goggles.
Look,

33:46.225 --> 33:47.791
Let me handle this.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.393
Oh, like you've handled
all this so far?

33:49.395 --> 33:52.295
All you've done is
sit back and watch

33:52.297 --> 33:54.798
As we've gotten
picked off one by one.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.802
Earl grey was a good man, with
powerful arms and a sexy accent,

33:58.804 --> 34:00.637
And now he's dead.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.774
His blood is on
your hands!

34:08.414 --> 34:10.414
I'm sorry, dean. She's wrong.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.681
No.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.183
She's not.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.584
You know,

34:14.586 --> 34:16.586
The only benefit of meeting you

34:16.588 --> 34:19.423
Is that I now know
I clearly have a type,

34:19.425 --> 34:21.358
And that type is a moron.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.560
I am not only
gonna make sure

34:23.562 --> 34:25.829
That you are taken off
this case and fired,

34:25.831 --> 34:29.566
But I'm gonna make sure
that everyone you know knows

34:29.568 --> 34:33.737
That when we had sex,
you asked me in<i> baby talk</i>

34:33.739 --> 34:35.839
If you could nurse from me.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.142
Please show yourself out.

34:47.553 --> 34:50.787
If you came here to apologize,
we're not interested.

34:50.789 --> 34:51.955
Oh, I never say I'm sorry.

34:51.957 --> 34:53.523
I've done what
I had to do

34:53.525 --> 34:54.724
For the sake
of this school

34:54.726 --> 34:56.259
And my career, both of which

34:56.261 --> 34:57.794
Will be here long after you

34:57.796 --> 35:00.297
Or any of the students here
are gone,

35:00.299 --> 35:02.432
Either through
graduation or death.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.935
I am shocked
that your husband left you.

35:04.937 --> 35:07.270
I do have something

35:07.272 --> 35:08.905
That might be of
interest to you

35:08.907 --> 35:11.341
About that night
in the tub.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.212
There were<i> two</i> babies.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.247
A boy and a girl.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.716
Twins.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.585
After I sent your mother

35:21.587 --> 35:24.454
And her two
slightly less bitchy friends out

35:24.456 --> 35:26.590
To get pillow cases and shovels,

35:26.592 --> 35:30.393
The girl in the tub
let out a death rattle

35:30.395 --> 35:33.930
That was so loud and powerful

35:33.932 --> 35:36.566
That she expelled a second child

35:36.568 --> 35:38.802
From her freshly dead womb.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.437
I knew it!

35:40.439 --> 35:41.771
Congratulations...

35:41.773 --> 35:43.573
On making this moment
all about you.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.276
Are you saying that boone
is the boy baby?

35:46.278 --> 35:47.777
My money's on yes.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.913
That newborn had that same...

35:49.915 --> 35:52.282
Cocky smirk that boone has.

35:52.284 --> 35:55.585
The one girl in the
bathroom who seemed
to have any humanity

35:55.587 --> 35:57.187
Took the babies.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.589
That was the last
I ever saw of them.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.092
But how did the babies end up
in a mental institution?

36:02.094 --> 36:05.529
More importantly, how did
the babies end up with gigi?

36:12.004 --> 36:13.770
I mean, I was wearing
the "sure thing oxford,"

36:13.772 --> 36:15.872
I used the cash chad gave me
to get this awesome hotel suite,

36:15.874 --> 36:18.108
And I basically told her that
my soul could not be at rest

36:18.110 --> 36:20.443
Unless she got naked with me.
Seriously, what kind of person

36:20.445 --> 36:23.380
Just turns their back
on someone's soul like that?

36:23.382 --> 36:25.315
You know,
I'm beginning to think

36:25.317 --> 36:27.851
She's not as amazing
as I thought she was.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.553
No.

36:29.555 --> 36:32.522
Where is gigi? Didn't
you tell her midnight?

36:32.524 --> 36:35.025
Hey, did I show you the knife
I got at the army supply store

36:35.027 --> 36:36.459
To kill her with?

36:36.461 --> 36:38.328
It's super fly.
You're gonna love this.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.497
(exhales)

36:40.499 --> 36:41.865
Ouch. (chuckles)

36:41.867 --> 36:42.866
(lock beeps, clicks)

36:42.868 --> 36:43.934
(door opens)

36:48.507 --> 36:52.175
Oh. I see that you're
enjoying the good life.
Don't start

36:52.177 --> 36:53.476
With the judgment,
gigi, all right?

36:53.478 --> 36:55.045
I've had a really tough day.

36:55.047 --> 36:57.747
You know, there's
an all-points bulletin out

36:57.749 --> 36:59.149
For your arrest.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.851
You jeopardized a plan

37:01.853 --> 37:04.221
That was almost 20 years
in the making

37:04.223 --> 37:06.523
When you kidnapped
zayday. Then...

37:06.525 --> 37:08.892
You disobeyed
my instructions

37:08.894 --> 37:11.861
To only come out
in the devil costume,

37:11.863 --> 37:15.232
And strolled around campus
in broad daylight

37:15.234 --> 37:18.235
Disguised as... Joaquin phoenix.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.570
That disguise was brilliant,
which is more than I can say

37:20.572 --> 37:22.872
For you,
justice scalia.
I'm not finished.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.741
You then...

37:24.743 --> 37:27.177
Have the brilliant idea
of actually going

37:27.179 --> 37:29.412
To kappa as yourself,

37:29.414 --> 37:31.581
Wearing a date shirt
and trying to convince zayday

37:31.583 --> 37:34.684
To sleep with you...
Because you're a ghost.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.420
Boone...

37:37.422 --> 37:38.588
You are...

37:38.590 --> 37:41.324
The weakest link.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.362
I spent the first few months
of my life motherless,

37:45.364 --> 37:48.598
Living off scraps of garbage
and stolen milk.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.767
I grew up in an institution
surrounded by people

37:50.769 --> 37:51.935
That called themselves
timothy busfield

37:51.937 --> 37:53.236
And ate their own poop.

37:53.238 --> 37:54.904
We've followed
all your rules,

37:54.906 --> 37:56.906
Gone along with all your plans,

37:56.908 --> 37:58.141
But I'm the one

37:58.143 --> 37:59.743
Who spent four years of my life

37:59.745 --> 38:02.078
Learning how to slow
my breathing and heart rate down

38:02.080 --> 38:03.813
To the point where
even a trained coroner

38:03.815 --> 38:05.749
Would declare me dead.

38:05.751 --> 38:06.983
I studied film makeup

38:06.985 --> 38:08.618
For eight months straight,

38:08.620 --> 38:10.754
And practiced on the patients,
so I could create

38:10.756 --> 38:12.322
The perfect slash mark
on my throat.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.758
Boone:
I pretended to be gay,

38:14.760 --> 38:16.760
And went undercover
in the dickie dollars scholars,

38:16.762 --> 38:18.628
And I was the one
who masterfully pretended

38:18.630 --> 38:21.965
To attack you with a chain saw
just to get the scent off you.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.767
Are you about
to break into song?

38:23.769 --> 38:26.002
Because all I'm hearing
out of your mouth is,

38:26.004 --> 38:27.437
♪ me, me, me, me, me. ♪

38:27.439 --> 38:29.439
So yes, gigi,
for once in my life,

38:29.441 --> 38:32.008
I went rogue and took
a little something for myself.

38:33.278 --> 38:35.278
My mother would have understood.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.947
But, of course, you don't.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.317
Because no matter
what you like to pretend,

38:40.319 --> 38:41.918
You're not her.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.753
(whispers):
What are you doing?

38:43.755 --> 38:45.422
I'm sorry, gigi.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.657
We're done taking
orders from you.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.093
We're grown-ups now.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.294
It's time for you to go.

38:51.296 --> 38:53.797
What? No. No.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.832
No, no, no!
No! (gasps)

38:58.470 --> 39:00.403
(choking)

39:07.012 --> 39:08.912
(panting)

39:10.682 --> 39:13.016
(exhales)

39:13.018 --> 39:15.618
Your commitment to revenge is...

39:15.620 --> 39:18.388
Clearly greater
than your brother's was.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.725
Should we get some room service?

39:25.997 --> 39:27.997
Hester:
<i>I have to say, chanel,</i>

39:27.999 --> 39:29.799
I am delighted and shocked
that you're letting me keep

39:29.801 --> 39:32.135
Whatever clothes I want--
it's really big of you,

39:32.137 --> 39:35.038
Considering the whole
"I'm pregnant with your
boyfriend's baby" thing.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.040
Well, honestly,
the more I thought about it,

39:37.042 --> 39:38.174
I just realized that

39:38.176 --> 39:39.743
I love chad so much,
and part

39:39.745 --> 39:41.911
Of loving someone is loving
every choice they make,

39:41.913 --> 39:44.981
Regardless of how selfish
and destructive it is, you know?

39:44.983 --> 39:46.750
Thank you, mommy.
Oh, and if you want

39:46.752 --> 39:48.985
To start calling me mommy,
now being that I'm the one

39:48.987 --> 39:50.387
That's gonna
actually be the mommy,

39:50.389 --> 39:52.088
I'm totally fine with that.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.724
Number six, before you
try on that kimono,

39:54.726 --> 39:57.060
Why haven't you had
any of this sushi?

39:57.062 --> 39:59.195
I mean, we got it
just for you.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.930
Mm, don't mind if I do.

40:00.932 --> 40:01.998
(chuckles)

40:03.368 --> 40:05.435
Mmm. That's so good.

40:05.437 --> 40:06.436
Mm-hmm.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.938
Oh, and do yourself a favor,

40:08.940 --> 40:10.039
Have a little slice of that

40:10.041 --> 40:11.908
Soft, unpasteurized cheese.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.743
It makes any sushi

40:13.745 --> 40:15.011
That much more delicious.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.714
Mmm! You're right.

40:17.716 --> 40:21.284
Oh, and, hester, you have<i> got</i>
to taste this champagne.

40:21.286 --> 40:24.354
It's a special champagne
with triple the alcohol and a...

40:24.356 --> 40:27.791
Nicotine-y mouth feel, because
it's infused with tobacco.

40:29.761 --> 40:30.860
Mmm.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.695
De-lish!

40:32.697 --> 40:33.930
Chanel:
Liar!

40:33.932 --> 40:36.032
Hester:
What the hell is going on?

40:36.034 --> 40:38.067
You're trapped
in a web of lies, whore.

40:38.069 --> 40:40.637
You just had sushi,
soft cheese and alcohol--

40:40.639 --> 40:42.906
Three foods that are
damaging to embryos.

40:42.908 --> 40:45.708
Which means you're not pregnant!
That's not true!

40:45.710 --> 40:47.544
I didn't know anything
about the whole...

40:47.546 --> 40:49.479
Sushi-cheese-alcohol thing!

40:49.481 --> 40:50.814
Fine! Prove it.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.081
You're not leaving
this room

40:52.083 --> 40:54.751
Until you've peed
on every single one

40:54.753 --> 40:56.319
Of these pregnancy tests.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.889
(chuckles)

40:59.891 --> 41:04.127
Hmm... I had all three
of you fooled, didn't I!

41:04.129 --> 41:06.396
Fine, you got me.
I'm not pregnant.

41:06.398 --> 41:09.132
But it doesn't matter, because
chad still thinks that I am,

41:09.134 --> 41:11.734
And being that he already
purchased our first-class
airfare to the hamptons,

41:11.736 --> 41:14.604
That means that I'll be the
one attending thanksgiving,
where I'll have

41:14.606 --> 41:17.941
Ample opportunity to get
pregnant all weekend long!

41:17.943 --> 41:19.809
(gasps quietly)

41:19.811 --> 41:24.080
Chanel (screeching):
I'll kill you, neckbrace...!

41:24.082 --> 41:25.682
(shrieking)

41:32.424 --> 41:34.357
Hester, I'm sorry.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.595
What did you say?

41:38.597 --> 41:41.097
Hester, I am so sorry.

41:41.099 --> 41:43.266
I'm sorry you've had
to go through life

41:43.268 --> 41:45.268
Feeling like an outcast, and...

41:45.270 --> 41:46.936
I'm sorry that I got angry

41:46.938 --> 41:49.772
That chad's
clearly chosen you over me.

41:49.774 --> 41:52.375
It's just that
ever since

41:52.377 --> 41:54.377
You walked
through those doors...

41:54.379 --> 41:58.147
I knew you were gonna be the one
to take it all away from me.

41:58.149 --> 41:59.282
Really?

41:59.284 --> 42:01.451
No.

42:03.788 --> 42:06.389
(scream echoing)

42:18.169 --> 42:19.869
(chanel gasps)
(bone cracks)

42:22.507 --> 42:24.207
(crying):
Oh, my god.

42:27.012 --> 42:27.911
You killed her!

42:27.913 --> 42:30.313
Chanel #6 is dead!

42:30.315 --> 42:31.748
I realize that
my killing neckbrace

42:31.750 --> 42:33.683
Might just seem
like a bridge too far,

42:33.685 --> 42:35.852
But trust me when I say
this had to happen.

42:35.854 --> 42:37.420
And I'm confident
that I'll be able

42:37.422 --> 42:40.256
To redeem myself morally
in everyone's eyes.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.725
(sighs)
and furthermore,

42:42.727 --> 42:45.929
What I just did will become
a<i> new</i> ghost story.

42:45.931 --> 42:48.164
A cautionary tale

42:48.166 --> 42:50.500
About what happens
to hog-faced bitches

42:50.502 --> 42:53.169
Who try to steal
hotter kappas' boyfriends.

42:53.171 --> 42:56.005
A story that'll be told
around the campfire

42:56.007 --> 42:59.909
By kappa pledges
for centuries to come.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.744
(chanel chuckles)

43:01.746 --> 43:03.246
(takes deep breath)

43:03.248 --> 43:06.416
Okay... Let's get her
in that meat locker.
