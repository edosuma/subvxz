00:00.977 --> 00:03.158
Previously on Riverdale...

00:03.161 --> 00:04.489
Kurtz!

00:04.492 --> 00:05.987
What the hell?

00:08.346 --> 00:10.175
I'm willing to sell
the Whyte Wyrm to you

00:10.177 --> 00:12.398
in exchange for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

00:12.401 --> 00:13.775
It's about Jason.

00:13.778 --> 00:15.862
The Farm gave me back my brother.

00:15.865 --> 00:17.364
Edgar Evernever decided

00:17.367 --> 00:20.127
he wants to adopt the
twins after he marries Mom.

00:20.130 --> 00:21.447
Now, that can't happen.

00:21.450 --> 00:25.139
I wonder, Betty, if you would
consider doing me a favor as well.

00:25.142 --> 00:27.073
Your dad and a few other inmates

00:27.076 --> 00:29.847
were being transported
to my father's prison,

00:29.850 --> 00:31.995
and there was some kind of accident.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.636
There were no survivors.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.935
Mr. Jones, what happened here?

01:20.938 --> 01:23.198
We don't know the answer to
that yet. We're working on it.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.323
It's him.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.461
He's back, the Black Hood.

01:28.649 --> 01:29.907
Betty's dad was on that bus.

01:29.910 --> 01:32.977
He was being transferred
to Hiram's prison.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.229
He's out there, Mr. Jones.

01:34.232 --> 01:36.066
No, no. Betty.

01:36.069 --> 01:38.069
No one survived this crash, I'm...

01:38.792 --> 01:39.932
I'm sorry.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.542
You know that he's dead?

01:42.545 --> 01:44.086
You're positive?

01:44.089 --> 01:46.223
There were five inmates
on that bus, one driver,

01:46.226 --> 01:48.146
that's six in total, which is...

01:50.268 --> 01:52.177
It's the number of heads we've found.

01:52.179 --> 01:55.579
DNA tests will confirm it if we can't
piece everyone back together, but...

01:56.984 --> 01:58.073
I'm sorry.

02:01.464 --> 02:03.538
Betty, we should go.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.444
He asked for my help with this transfer.

02:06.447 --> 02:08.368
He wanted this, Veronica.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.930
What if he planned
this? What if he escaped?

02:12.624 --> 02:14.224
He could still be out there.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.631
Archie?

02:22.634 --> 02:23.845
Mom.

02:25.321 --> 02:27.028
Oh...

02:27.031 --> 02:28.804
I would've picked you
up from the airport,

02:28.807 --> 02:29.973
but Dad took his truck,

02:29.975 --> 02:31.683
and I'm not sure the
jalopy's your speed.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.149
Oh, that's fine. I took an Uber.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.294
But have you had breakfast yet?

02:34.296 --> 02:35.746
We can go to Pop's, my treat.

02:35.749 --> 02:37.572
Actually, can we do dinner instead?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.466
I was gonna head to the
gym before school starts.

02:39.468 --> 02:41.624
Yeah, your dad mentioned
that you'd taken up boxing.

02:41.627 --> 02:43.252
Said you're pretty serious about it.

02:43.255 --> 02:45.017
I am, yeah.

02:45.020 --> 02:47.300
That's not why you came,
is it? To talk me out of it?

02:47.303 --> 02:48.336
Not at all.

02:48.339 --> 02:51.353
Things were slow in Chicago, and I just
wanted to spend some time with my son.

02:51.355 --> 02:53.054
- That's all.
- Ah.

02:53.057 --> 02:55.608
What, have you come to
steal more babies, Elizabeth?

02:55.611 --> 02:58.810
No, I came to warn you that
Dad might be on the loose.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.413
FP already called.
There were no survivors.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.957
Well, Dr. Curdle Jr. hasn't
identified the bodies yet,

03:03.959 --> 03:05.320
so we don't know that.

03:05.323 --> 03:08.161
And this is what I mean
about letting go of your past.

03:08.163 --> 03:11.414
Stop indulging in these morbid delusions

03:11.416 --> 03:14.576
that your serial killer of a
father is somehow still alive.

03:17.455 --> 03:18.931
Did you get a tattoo?

03:20.333 --> 03:21.883
Yes.

03:21.885 --> 03:23.936
Edgar asked me to get it.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.098
I like to think of it
as an engagement ring.

03:27.316 --> 03:28.723
How are you feeling?

03:28.725 --> 03:31.401
You mean, considering
that Mom abandoned me?

03:35.324 --> 03:36.657
She didn't abandon you.

03:38.902 --> 03:42.028
Actually, Mom leaving town is probably
the most selfless thing she's ever done.

03:42.030 --> 03:44.110
I've never lived anywhere without her.

03:44.774 --> 03:47.209
Well, I'm glad you decided to stay.

03:48.820 --> 03:50.862
Just no more playing G&G, okay?

03:50.864 --> 03:53.173
Why is everyone so freaked out about it?

03:53.175 --> 03:56.972
It's just pretend quests and costumes.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.187
Who was in costume?

03:58.190 --> 04:01.630
Well, Ricky had those
ears and I had a crown,

04:01.633 --> 04:04.601
and the Gargoyle King, of course.

04:06.338 --> 04:08.564
Wait, you met the Gargoyle King?

04:08.566 --> 04:10.715
Like, in person? What happened?

04:10.717 --> 04:12.175
He gave me and Ricky a quest.

04:12.177 --> 04:13.177
You talked to him?

04:14.136 --> 04:15.253
What did he say?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.947
Said that I couldn't enter the Kingdom.

04:16.949 --> 04:18.699
Not until I have the Gospel.

04:18.701 --> 04:19.940
That was our next quest.

04:19.942 --> 04:21.285
"The Gospel."

04:22.229 --> 04:23.686
What's the Gospel?

04:23.688 --> 04:25.622
I don't know. We never found it.

04:25.624 --> 04:28.566
But Ricky said that the Gospel

04:28.568 --> 04:31.044
is where the Gargoyle
King keeps all his secrets.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.383
Good morning, boys.

04:36.385 --> 04:38.552
And good news, Archie.

04:38.554 --> 04:40.245
I've got your fight application.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.388
What are you talking about?

04:41.390 --> 04:42.538
For the Regional Classic.

04:42.540 --> 04:43.496
Nice.

04:43.499 --> 04:45.041
That's a hot tournament.
How'd you get him in?

04:45.043 --> 04:47.085
I'm very persuasive when I need to be.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.063
You'll be ready.

04:48.066 --> 04:49.804
You just got to get your
mom or dad to sign off on it

04:49.806 --> 04:51.225
so we can make the deadline.

04:51.228 --> 04:54.761
This is the perfect opportunity
to jump-start your boxing career.

04:54.764 --> 04:58.373
Hey, if you ever want to add
another client to your roster,

04:58.376 --> 04:59.889
I'd love to have a manager like you.

04:59.891 --> 05:02.192
I'll think about it, Mad Dog.

05:02.194 --> 05:04.819
Guys, Old Faithful just
opened up in the locker room.

05:04.821 --> 05:06.914
I think a pipe burst.
I turned the water off,

05:06.916 --> 05:09.324
but someone should go
take a look at that.

05:09.326 --> 05:10.784
I'll fix it.

05:10.786 --> 05:12.235
What, suddenly you're a plumber?

05:12.237 --> 05:13.717
- Bring in a professional.
- Ronnie.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.072
I've actually been meaning to talk
to you, Archie. As your manager.

05:17.075 --> 05:20.669
This gym has charm to spare,
but it could use an update.

05:20.671 --> 05:21.586
A little sprucing up.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.121
With what money, Ronnie?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.522
Mine.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.174
I'd like to invest in you and your gym.

05:27.177 --> 05:29.085
La Bonne Nuit has been
doing very well lately,

05:29.087 --> 05:32.013
and I wouldn't mind
diversifying my portfolio

05:32.015 --> 05:34.095
to include a property on the Southside.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.194
Can't be a coincidence.

05:37.196 --> 05:38.536
He asked for the transfer,

05:38.538 --> 05:42.002
and then his bus just burst into flames?

05:42.005 --> 05:46.101
He planned it. He used me to
escape, and now he's out there.

05:46.104 --> 05:48.121
Betty, I was with you.

05:48.123 --> 05:50.440
I saw what was left of that bus.

05:50.442 --> 05:51.691
Nobody could've survived that.

05:51.693 --> 05:52.984
Yeah, but if he did...

05:52.986 --> 05:56.463
If he did, you've got
me, you have the Serpents,

05:56.465 --> 05:58.465
you have Archie and
his fight-club buddies.

05:58.467 --> 06:01.409
You have a veritable
armada here to protect you.

06:01.411 --> 06:03.786
Also, you can move back
in with my dad and I.

06:03.788 --> 06:05.872
It's been a lot quieter
since my mom's been gone.

06:05.874 --> 06:08.717
Mmm, I'm sorry that she left, Jug.

06:08.719 --> 06:10.626
How's JB doing after all this?

06:10.628 --> 06:12.170
Shockingly well.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.039
And she's filled in some key blanks.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.387
Apparently, there's a Gospel of the
Gargoyle King out there somewhere.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.565
Could be important.

06:18.568 --> 06:20.653
My dad's been sweeping
Junkyard Steve's...

06:20.656 --> 06:24.140
Sorry to interrupt your no
doubt thrilling catch-up, chums,

06:24.142 --> 06:27.235
but, as you know, junior
prom is this weekend.

06:27.237 --> 06:28.662
The theme is Fire and Ice,

06:28.664 --> 06:30.980
and, naturally, Toni
and I are campaigning

06:30.982 --> 06:33.649
to be the most captivating prom
queens this school's ever seen.

06:33.651 --> 06:36.911
So it goes without saying,
vote Choni for co-monarchs

06:36.913 --> 06:39.489
because, when you really think about it,

06:39.491 --> 06:41.049
no other options make sense.

06:42.827 --> 06:45.178
Prom is this weekend?

06:45.180 --> 06:47.014
We still do things like that here?

06:47.016 --> 06:48.223
I mean, apparently.

06:49.869 --> 06:51.077
Jug...

06:52.295 --> 06:54.855
Will you go to prom with me?

06:54.857 --> 06:56.714
Only for you, Betty Cooper.

07:10.688 --> 07:12.781
Hey, peanut butter and banana.

07:12.783 --> 07:15.358
Thought you might be
hungry, ready for a break.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.026
Definitely.

07:17.028 --> 07:19.470
Actually, Mom, I wanted
to ask you something.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.863
There's a tournament this
weekend that I want to box in,

07:21.866 --> 07:22.770
the Regional Classic.

07:22.773 --> 07:24.885
I just need you to sign my
application to let me compete.

07:24.887 --> 07:26.111
Archie...

07:26.113 --> 07:27.796
Let me guess. You don't want me to box.

07:27.798 --> 07:30.915
I didn't even want you to play football.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.008
And boxing is so much more brutal.

07:34.011 --> 07:37.513
I'm behind on everything
else, but I'm good at boxing.

07:37.516 --> 07:39.066
I was actually thinking about going pro.

07:39.068 --> 07:40.788
Going pro?

07:40.791 --> 07:43.136
Archie, I know you've been
dealing with a lot lately...

07:43.138 --> 07:46.448
- Mom.
- But I won't support you getting pummeled.

08:02.590 --> 08:05.741
The range is closing.
Please return your gear.

08:11.749 --> 08:13.082
Dr. Curdle Jr.

08:13.084 --> 08:14.843
Ms. Cooper, hello.

08:14.845 --> 08:16.442
Have you identified the bodies?

08:16.445 --> 08:18.920
The corpses were charred
beyond recognition.

08:18.923 --> 08:22.350
But I was able to work
with one semi-intact hand,

08:22.352 --> 08:26.471
and it matches your father,
DNA and fingerprints.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.431
It's him, Ms. Cooper.

08:28.433 --> 08:31.618
For good or ill, your father is dead.

08:45.454 --> 08:48.923
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

08:58.123 --> 08:59.773
Hey, Dad, have you seen Jellybean?

08:59.776 --> 09:01.290
I dropped her off at school. Listen.

09:01.292 --> 09:02.548
I'm at Junkyard Steve's.

09:02.550 --> 09:04.008
You better get down here and see this.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.136
Okay, I'm on my way.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.407
Since this is where Kurtz brought you

09:19.409 --> 09:21.168
and where he was killed
by the Gargoyle King,

09:21.170 --> 09:23.795
me and my men have been
doing a sweep of the junkyard.

09:24.569 --> 09:25.902
It led us to this bus.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.665
Looks like this is where Kurtz...

09:35.667 --> 09:37.767
and some other Gargoyles were crashing.

09:57.956 --> 09:59.122
The Gospel.

10:11.220 --> 10:13.140
Veronica.

10:14.723 --> 10:16.747
Uh, my mom signed.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.249
I can enter the Regional Classic.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.917
And not a moment too soon.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.637
We can submit it now and get
it in just under the deadline.

10:22.639 --> 10:23.767
Awesome.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.692
Are you sure about this?

10:27.694 --> 10:29.477
I love seeing you back in the ring,

10:29.479 --> 10:32.054
but if the tournament's too
soon, we can send Mad Dog.

10:32.056 --> 10:33.931
You can keep training and go next year.

10:33.933 --> 10:34.932
I'm ready.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.327
It's just, um, I was wondering...

10:39.155 --> 10:40.914
What are you doing for prom?

10:40.916 --> 10:43.836
- Prom?
- Yeah, I thought maybe we could go together.

10:44.569 --> 10:46.329
As friends.

10:47.497 --> 10:49.339
I would honestly love that.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.658
Yeah? Great.

10:52.660 --> 10:54.620
- Great.
- Prom tickets here!

10:56.181 --> 10:58.456
Get your prom tickets here.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.684
Uh, actually, we'll take two, please.

11:01.419 --> 11:02.936
Well, well, well.

11:02.938 --> 11:05.555
What was off is now back on again.

11:05.557 --> 11:07.089
You owe me a cherry phosphate.

11:07.091 --> 11:08.341
We're just going as friends.

11:08.343 --> 11:09.246
Hmm.

11:09.249 --> 11:11.777
- In fact, we'll be paying separately.
- Whatever.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.971
Just remember to vote
Choni for prom queens, okay?

11:13.973 --> 11:15.282
Thanks. Bye.

11:18.269 --> 11:20.537
Cheryl, what are you doing?

11:20.539 --> 11:22.530
Campaigning for prom queen
is strictly forbidden.

11:22.532 --> 11:24.457
"Forbidden"? What's up with that?

11:24.459 --> 11:25.656
The Farm prohibits it

11:25.659 --> 11:28.378
because it goes against
our strictures of equality.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.830
Remember, "The one become
many, the many, one"?

11:30.832 --> 11:32.582
Easy for you to say, Evelyn.

11:32.584 --> 11:34.325
Aren't you, like, 30?

11:34.327 --> 11:35.668
How many proms have you been to?

11:35.670 --> 11:36.836
This is a test.

11:36.838 --> 11:38.574
You can either be queens for one night,

11:38.577 --> 11:41.457
or you can live in the glory
of the Farm for all of eternity.

11:41.459 --> 11:42.792
Which would you prefer?

11:42.794 --> 11:44.728
Honestly, both.

11:55.807 --> 11:59.047
There's a lot of mythical
stuff in this Gospel, Betty.

12:00.070 --> 12:03.354
The Gargoyles were
thought to be evil spirits

12:03.356 --> 12:05.981
that lived in the
clouds, preying on people.

12:05.983 --> 12:08.607
So the Gryphon Queen
turned them to stone.

12:08.610 --> 12:11.178
They fell from the Kingdom and
shattered when they hit the earth.

12:11.181 --> 12:12.738
Jug...

12:12.740 --> 12:15.917
All this lore builds
up the Gargoyle King

12:15.919 --> 12:18.661
to be some kind of
supernatural creature,

12:18.663 --> 12:20.847
but this guy is just a serial killer.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.499
Just like my dad.

12:23.501 --> 12:25.593
The Black Hood was flesh and blood,

12:25.595 --> 12:27.228
and so is the Gargoyle King.

12:29.691 --> 12:31.217
Which means...

12:34.363 --> 12:35.818
That he can die.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.276
Betty, if you need a couple days,

12:42.278 --> 12:43.674
you can take a break.

12:43.677 --> 12:46.706
No. I need to keep moving.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.876
I just want this to end.

12:54.466 --> 12:55.840
It's Dr. Curdle Jr.

12:57.127 --> 12:59.602
He's got results from
Kurtz's autopsy for us.

13:04.459 --> 13:06.250
Hey, Archie, could I
talk to you for a sec?

13:06.252 --> 13:08.302
Yeah, sure. What's up?

13:08.304 --> 13:11.472
I know you're upset with me that I
wouldn't let you enter the tournament.

13:11.474 --> 13:14.734
And believe it or not, I'm really happy
that you found something that you love.

13:14.736 --> 13:15.985
I do love it, Mom.

13:16.613 --> 13:17.926
Well, listen.

13:17.929 --> 13:20.973
I called a recruiter from the
Naval Academy, old friend of mine,

13:20.976 --> 13:23.434
and they have an amazing boxing program.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.685
Even scholarships.

13:24.687 --> 13:26.996
So, you could box and get an education.

13:28.357 --> 13:29.991
Will you at least talk to her?

13:29.993 --> 13:32.502
Sure, Mom. Of course.

13:33.154 --> 13:34.254
Thanks.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.258
Judging by the healing,

13:38.260 --> 13:41.502
I'd say Mr. Kurtz got
these tattoos last month.

13:41.504 --> 13:46.582
Yet again, the same symbols that were
carved into Ben, Dilton, and Baby Teeth.

13:46.584 --> 13:48.584
Well, the Gospel says that
you need these markings

13:48.586 --> 13:50.328
in order to be sent to the Kingdom.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.756
Maybe these tattoos are Kurtz's
way of trying to slip his way in.

13:53.758 --> 13:56.798
Jug, whoever gave him these
tattoos could be a new lead.

14:07.605 --> 14:09.480
Thanks for coming all this way, Brooke.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.271
- I owe you one.
- Happy to help, Mary.

14:11.274 --> 14:12.959
Just buy me a drink
later, we'll call it even.

14:12.961 --> 14:14.076
Done and done.

14:14.078 --> 14:15.628
Brooke, this is my son, Archie.

14:15.630 --> 14:16.940
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.651
So, you guys go way back, huh?

14:18.654 --> 14:21.282
We do. We met at Sarah Florence.

14:21.285 --> 14:22.724
We were roommates freshman year.

14:22.727 --> 14:25.787
So your mom tells me you're interested
in boxing for the Naval Academy.

14:25.790 --> 14:27.122
Uh, possibly.

14:27.124 --> 14:29.542
Well, the Academy's
physical education program

14:29.544 --> 14:31.961
requires all midshipmen
to participate in boxing,

14:31.963 --> 14:34.296
so you'll have plenty of competition.

14:34.298 --> 14:36.557
And as a member of the boxing club,

14:36.559 --> 14:38.392
you train with the best.

14:38.394 --> 14:41.395
But the Academy also prepares
you for life outside the gym.

14:41.397 --> 14:43.639
Over four years, you
get a great education,

14:43.641 --> 14:45.658
a college degree, and a job.

14:45.660 --> 14:46.748
In the military?

14:46.751 --> 14:49.477
Upon graduation, you serve
five years active duty.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.680
By the time I'm finished,

14:50.682 --> 14:52.999
my prime boxing years
might be behind me.

14:53.001 --> 14:55.668
Yeah, but that's why you need to
find something real to fall back on.

14:55.670 --> 14:58.984
And many of our boxers go on
to have professional careers.

14:58.987 --> 15:01.280
Our program is extremely competitive.

15:01.283 --> 15:03.751
I'd want to see you in the ring first.

15:03.753 --> 15:06.203
Well, Archie, I'm sure that you
can set up an exhibition match

15:06.205 --> 15:07.496
so that Brooke can see what you can do.

15:07.498 --> 15:09.665
Yeah. Yeah, I can ask Fangs.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.376
Great. Let's do this Friday evening?

15:12.378 --> 15:13.625
We'll be there.

15:18.193 --> 15:19.433
Got IDs?

15:19.435 --> 15:21.769
Gotta be 18 or over to get inked.

15:21.771 --> 15:25.013
Actually, we were wondering if you, um,

15:25.016 --> 15:26.774
recognized this?

15:30.580 --> 15:32.229
Matter of fact, yeah.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.541
Kid came in asking for those
symbols a few weeks back.

15:34.543 --> 15:35.785
Did he mention why?

15:35.788 --> 15:38.068
Nah, just showed me the
design and paid cash.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.495
Just like the first guy.

15:39.497 --> 15:41.363
Wait. There was a first guy?

15:41.365 --> 15:44.334
Yeah, about a year ago, I gave that
same tattoo to a different dude.

15:44.337 --> 15:46.576
Same symbols, also on his back.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.371
Do you have a name?
Maybe a photo, by chance?

15:49.373 --> 15:50.782
Never ask for names.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.092
Normally, I like to take
photos of my finished work,

15:53.094 --> 15:55.303
but this guy would not let
a camera anywhere near him.

15:55.305 --> 15:56.670
No photos, huh?

15:56.672 --> 15:58.632
Sounds like someone that I know.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.525
What did he look like?

16:01.593 --> 16:03.569
Sandy hair, blue eyes...

16:03.572 --> 16:05.238
Weirdly magnetic?

16:06.515 --> 16:07.956
That's the guy.

16:07.959 --> 16:09.321
Mmm-hmm.

16:10.645 --> 16:12.491
Thanks.

16:12.494 --> 16:16.329
Evelyn told me what you've
been doing, Sister Cheryl.

16:16.332 --> 16:21.962
She said that you've been
campaigning for prom queen.

16:21.965 --> 16:23.572
Brother Edgar,

16:23.574 --> 16:26.384
think about what it would
mean if I were prom queen.

16:26.386 --> 16:30.129
Standing on that stage,
a crown on my head...

16:30.131 --> 16:32.891
I could use that platform
to spread the Farm's message.

16:32.893 --> 16:34.667
Cheryl.

16:34.669 --> 16:36.418
Do you like being a
member of our community?

16:36.420 --> 16:39.004
Yes, immensely.

16:39.006 --> 16:40.273
That is good.

16:42.443 --> 16:45.593
But standing with us...

16:45.596 --> 16:47.763
requires sacrifice.

16:47.765 --> 16:51.868
Now, if you can't let something
as trivial as prom queen go...

16:54.772 --> 16:58.633
I'm afraid we can't have you speaking
with your brother Jason any longer.

17:03.206 --> 17:05.714
I understand, and I'm done campaigning.

17:07.117 --> 17:10.303
Just please don't take Jason away.

17:12.413 --> 17:13.741
No question.

17:13.743 --> 17:17.392
This is a unique and
handsomely-maintained property, Ms. Lodge.

17:17.395 --> 17:19.294
I have no doubt your
loan will be approved.

17:19.296 --> 17:20.813
That's great. Thank you.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.208
Veronica.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.644
- Tell me you're not selling...
- Absolutely not, Pop.

17:26.646 --> 17:30.267
I'm just looking to get a loan
to help Archie and his boxing gym.

17:30.270 --> 17:32.053
I thought you and Archie...

17:32.056 --> 17:33.641
We're just friends, Pop.

17:33.644 --> 17:36.329
Friends and business associates.

17:49.035 --> 17:52.661
You're over by six pounds.

17:52.663 --> 17:54.703
Sorry, but you're not fighting, kid.

17:57.084 --> 17:58.917
No, no, no. Commissioner.

17:58.919 --> 18:00.836
I'll cut down. I'll make the weight.

18:00.838 --> 18:02.504
By Friday?

18:02.506 --> 18:04.698
- Good luck with that.
- Friday?

18:04.701 --> 18:06.434
I thought the fight was on Saturday.

18:06.436 --> 18:08.034
Last-minute change.

18:08.037 --> 18:10.512
The fight's at 4:00, but I can't
let you in the ring at this weight.

18:10.514 --> 18:11.474
I'll be there...

18:12.442 --> 18:13.816
minus six pounds.

18:16.062 --> 18:19.688
Jug, the tattoo artist said
that a guy with blond hair

18:19.690 --> 18:23.734
and blue eyes got a Gargoyle
King tattoo about a year ago,

18:23.736 --> 18:26.195
right around the time
the Farm moved to town,

18:26.197 --> 18:29.457
and right before any of this
game stuff started to happen.

18:29.459 --> 18:33.202
Add the fact that my
mom just got a tattoo...

18:33.204 --> 18:36.121
per Mr. Evernever's request.

18:36.123 --> 18:37.673
Okay.

18:37.675 --> 18:39.568
But if the Gargoyle King is Edgar,

18:39.571 --> 18:43.228
then how does that explain your mom
seeing him during Ascension Night

18:43.231 --> 18:45.732
nearly two decades
before Edgar got to town?

18:45.734 --> 18:48.651
Who says that the new Gargoyle
King is the same person

18:48.653 --> 18:50.358
as the old one?

18:50.361 --> 18:53.554
My mom gave testimony to the
Farm about the Midnight Club.

18:53.557 --> 18:56.391
Edgar could have taken on that persona.

18:56.393 --> 18:58.778
I know that Edgar has been
messing with your family.

18:58.780 --> 19:00.062
Think about it.

19:00.064 --> 19:02.582
Edgar bought The Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

19:02.584 --> 19:04.417
where the game originated.

19:04.419 --> 19:08.996
Both he and the Gargoyle
King preached Ascension.

19:08.998 --> 19:11.615
Both of them have followers
that they manipulate,

19:11.617 --> 19:14.177
and they're both really, really creepy.

19:15.579 --> 19:17.619
There's only one way to settle this...

19:19.291 --> 19:20.475
and fast.

19:21.936 --> 19:24.128
I don't know if this is a cry for help

19:24.130 --> 19:27.181
or if you need to seriously
refine your taste in athletic wear.

19:27.183 --> 19:29.216
I gotta lose weight
for this fight Friday.

19:29.218 --> 19:30.509
Are you sure that's enough time?

19:30.511 --> 19:31.927
I'll do it.

19:31.929 --> 19:33.854
Can you give me a ride back here after?

19:33.856 --> 19:35.281
I gotta focus in the car.

19:35.283 --> 19:36.557
Focus on what?

19:36.559 --> 19:37.933
Another fight.

19:37.935 --> 19:41.120
My mom invited this
recruiter to come see me box.

19:41.122 --> 19:43.313
Archie, that's insane.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.149
You can't fight twice in the same day.

19:45.151 --> 19:48.191
Just invite your mom and the
recruiter to the tournament.

19:49.113 --> 19:50.797
That's the thing.

19:50.799 --> 19:53.049
My mom didn't sign that waiver, I did.

19:53.051 --> 19:54.331
I forged her signature.

19:54.334 --> 19:56.360
She doesn't want me to
fight in this tournament,

19:56.362 --> 19:59.621
so much so that she brought this
recruiter all the way from Annapolis.

19:59.623 --> 20:01.974
- So...
- So you've got to give her a good show.

20:01.976 --> 20:03.959
I get it.

20:03.961 --> 20:06.121
And I'll make sure you
get back here in time.

20:07.649 --> 20:11.008
Many tribes, when their elders die,

20:11.010 --> 20:12.467
would consume their bodies

20:12.469 --> 20:14.720
to absorb the wisdom.

20:14.722 --> 20:16.239
Very good question, Alice.

20:17.191 --> 20:19.933
Now, who's next?

20:19.935 --> 20:21.518
Me.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.355
How about you admit that
you are the Gargoyle King?

20:25.357 --> 20:27.408
Edgar, I am so sorry.

20:27.410 --> 20:29.618
It's all right, Alice.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.321
Clearly, whatever is on Betty's mind

20:32.323 --> 20:33.822
must be very important.

20:33.824 --> 20:35.117
Why don't you join us?

20:36.869 --> 20:42.789
And we can unpack this obsession
you have with the Gargoyle King.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.999
I have a better idea.

20:45.002 --> 20:46.919
Why don't you take off your shirt?

20:46.921 --> 20:49.263
- Betty.
- I want to see your tattoos.

20:49.265 --> 20:50.314
I do have a tattoo.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.292
On my wrist.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.279
It's an infinity symbol,
just like many of us here.

20:56.281 --> 21:00.199
I'm talking about the runic
symbols that would be on your back.

21:00.201 --> 21:02.392
This is sublimation, Betty.

21:02.394 --> 21:06.188
But I have nothing to hide.

21:06.190 --> 21:07.290
Then prove it.

21:30.543 --> 21:31.647
There.

21:33.008 --> 21:36.736
Does that satisfy you, Betty?

22:36.965 --> 22:38.947
Just a hair under the limit.

22:38.949 --> 22:41.041
Well done, Archie.

22:41.043 --> 22:43.327
Now let's get you to bout number one.

22:48.625 --> 22:49.951
Don't worry about it.

22:49.954 --> 22:53.354
It should be a relief that your mom's
not marrying a second serial killer.

22:57.819 --> 22:59.661
If not Edgar, then who?

22:59.664 --> 23:01.061
If we're gonna catch the Gargoyle King,

23:01.063 --> 23:02.679
it's going to be on his own terms.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.516
- His Gospel?
- Yes.

23:06.518 --> 23:08.327
Now, I think that
there's a ritual in here

23:08.329 --> 23:10.687
that will help invoke
him. Just listen to this.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.832
"After the false prophet is sacrificed,

23:12.834 --> 23:14.408
the shire will have a bacchanal

23:14.410 --> 23:16.577
to celebrate the coronation
of the Gryphon Queen."

23:16.579 --> 23:18.663
Does that sound like any
imminent school event to you?

23:18.665 --> 23:19.903
Junior prom?

23:19.906 --> 23:23.366
"Upon her crowning, the Gryphon
Queen will ensure the King's arrival

23:23.369 --> 23:24.868
by subjugating herself

23:24.870 --> 23:27.054
and declaring that the one true monarch

23:27.056 --> 23:28.912
of Eldervair is the Gargoyle King."

23:28.915 --> 23:30.999
I'm assuming I'm the Gryphon
Queen in this scenario?

23:31.001 --> 23:34.020
Right. Ergo, we just have to ensure
that you're crowned prom queen.

23:34.022 --> 23:36.546
So, maybe we switch the prom theme

23:36.548 --> 23:38.965
to something G&G-related.

23:38.967 --> 23:42.269
Assuming that the Gospel is, well,
gospel, he's going to show up.

23:42.271 --> 23:45.055
I mean, he's not going to
ignore his own rules, right?

23:45.057 --> 23:47.891
And then we just need to ensure
that you're elected prom queen.

23:47.893 --> 23:49.226
So what if we do all of that

23:49.228 --> 23:51.978
and the Gargoyle King
still doesn't materialize?

23:51.980 --> 23:55.232
Then the junior prom is just another
horrible mainstream school event

23:55.234 --> 23:56.266
that we'll have to endure.

23:57.335 --> 24:00.449
Speaking of which, who is the
chair of the prom committee?

24:02.392 --> 24:03.749
Hi, Cheryl.

24:03.752 --> 24:08.136
We had an idea that we
wanted to run by you.

24:08.139 --> 24:11.873
Now, we realize that our
prom's theme, Fire and Ice,

24:11.875 --> 24:13.334
was decided months ago.

24:13.337 --> 24:15.210
But frankly, people don't
know what that means.

24:15.212 --> 24:18.880
Right. So what if we specify
the theme a little bit?

24:18.889 --> 24:22.633
Maybe we call it something
like "The Renaissance,"

24:22.636 --> 24:24.428
or "Medieval Times."

24:24.430 --> 24:27.323
Sure. Whatever.

24:27.325 --> 24:30.225
Cheryl, did you hear
anything we just said?

24:30.227 --> 24:32.766
Yes. And for all I care,

24:32.769 --> 24:35.489
change the theme, make everyone
wear chainmail and corsets.

24:35.491 --> 24:36.749
Turn the photo booth into a pillory.

24:36.751 --> 24:38.741
Hand out turkey legs.

24:38.744 --> 24:41.184
What does it matter if
I'm not gonna be queen?

25:11.143 --> 25:13.452
It was a great fight, Archie.

25:13.454 --> 25:15.270
You almost had him.

25:15.272 --> 25:17.998
One more round and I would've.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.876
I won't lose two fights in the same day.

25:20.878 --> 25:23.087
What, that exhibition fight with Fangs?

25:23.090 --> 25:24.998
No, Archie.

25:25.001 --> 25:28.040
You are punch-drunk if you think I'm
gonna let you fight another match.

25:28.043 --> 25:29.784
You look like you were hit by a truck.

25:29.786 --> 25:32.177
Archie, you hobbled out of
that ring, dead on your feet.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.410
I'm fine, Veronica.

25:33.413 --> 25:36.499
I told my mom I'd be there. I
don't want to disappoint her.

25:36.502 --> 25:38.644
I'll get her and the
recruiter to reschedule.

25:38.646 --> 25:39.961
You can't. She's leaving.

25:39.963 --> 25:41.796
Then I'll get her to come back.

25:41.798 --> 25:44.400
My persistence is stronger
than your uppercut.

25:47.062 --> 25:48.821
I'll go first,

25:48.823 --> 25:51.740
and smooth out any ruffled feathers.

26:04.279 --> 26:05.987
Veronica, where's Archie?

26:05.989 --> 26:08.290
Yeah, I'm going cold in here.

26:08.292 --> 26:11.034
Ms. Andrews, Counselor
Rivers, I presume.

26:11.036 --> 26:12.753
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,

26:12.755 --> 26:14.755
but Archie is not gonna
be able to make it.

26:14.757 --> 26:16.039
What? Why not?

26:16.041 --> 26:17.850
He's feeling under the weather.

26:17.852 --> 26:20.019
Since when? He was fine this morning.

26:20.021 --> 26:21.261
We think it's food poisoning.

26:21.263 --> 26:22.521
I'd love to reschedule.

26:22.523 --> 26:23.880
I can fight.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.215
I can fight.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.975
I can still do this.

26:26.977 --> 26:29.069
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm fine.

26:30.597 --> 26:32.898
I'd like to show you what I got, ma'am.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.557
Fangs, you ready?

26:34.560 --> 26:35.769
Yeah, let's do it.

26:45.862 --> 26:47.062
Archie!

26:49.120 --> 26:50.912
Serpents, Poisons.

26:50.915 --> 26:52.198
We have a proposition for you.

26:52.201 --> 26:54.411
The Pretty Poisons don't
take orders from you.

26:54.413 --> 26:59.040
Please, Peaches. We're talking
about a prom night truce.

26:59.042 --> 27:02.426
So that we can all work together
to catch the Gargoyle King.

27:03.556 --> 27:04.831
How does that sound?

27:06.383 --> 27:08.049
The Poisons can get behind that.

27:08.051 --> 27:11.019
During prom, groups of you will
be stationed at every entrance.

27:11.021 --> 27:13.221
Once the announcement
for prom queen begins,

27:13.223 --> 27:15.724
you guys are gonna bar
anyone from exiting the gym.

27:15.726 --> 27:18.560
Whoever's cosplaying as the
Gargoyle King is going to be there,

27:18.562 --> 27:20.437
and this is going to be
our one shot at nabbing him.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.273
- Will he be in costume?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.900
At the minimum, he's gonna have
some sort of kingly signifier

27:25.902 --> 27:28.161
like a crown or antlers and the like,

27:28.163 --> 27:31.239
and he's going to make his move
after Betty is crowned prom queen.

27:31.241 --> 27:33.050
Let's end this nightmare...

27:33.836 --> 27:35.052
once and for all.

27:52.095 --> 27:53.637
Nice and slow.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.430
You took a fall there, kiddo.

27:55.432 --> 27:58.433
That's what happens when you try
to fight two matches in one day

27:58.435 --> 28:00.786
after starving yourself for a week.

28:03.198 --> 28:05.207
Where's Ronnie?

28:05.209 --> 28:07.050
I asked Veronica to give us some space

28:07.053 --> 28:09.169
so we can talk about what's
really going on with you.

28:10.573 --> 28:12.014
I shouldn't have double-booked.

28:12.017 --> 28:15.478
Yeah, and you shouldn't have
forged my signature and lied to me.

28:15.481 --> 28:17.831
Not to mention risking
your health, Archie.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.497
And to what end?

28:19.500 --> 28:20.963
Mom, I want to be a boxer.

28:20.966 --> 28:23.150
And you were so excited
about the recruiter

28:23.153 --> 28:25.459
that I wanted to give your way a shot.

28:25.462 --> 28:27.462
But I don't want to join the Navy.

28:28.465 --> 28:30.098
I don't want to go to college.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.059
It's a losing battle for me.

28:32.061 --> 28:35.887
I want to see how far these fists
can take me, and I want to fight.

28:35.889 --> 28:38.139
And you're 17 years old.

28:38.141 --> 28:39.566
You're thinking about tomorrow,

28:39.568 --> 28:41.648
I'm thinking about
the rest of your life.

29:00.809 --> 29:02.025
Hey, Pop.

29:02.028 --> 29:04.090
I'm closing La Bonne
Nuit early for the night.

29:04.093 --> 29:06.133
Most of my regulars will be at prom.

29:06.795 --> 29:08.687
- Veronica...
- What?

29:10.358 --> 29:11.857
What's going on, Pop?

29:11.859 --> 29:15.444
A few months back, I
found something out.

29:15.446 --> 29:17.366
Something I should have told you.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.637
You're gonna want to sit down for this.

29:43.632 --> 29:47.134
Well, shall we, my lady?

29:47.136 --> 29:48.769
Lead on, Hellcaster.

29:53.976 --> 29:56.268
You two want to vote for prom court?

29:56.270 --> 29:57.528
How's the turnout been?

29:57.530 --> 29:59.071
Lackluster.

29:59.073 --> 30:00.930
Luckily, you're running unopposed.

30:00.932 --> 30:04.493
Still, we don't want any surprises.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.340
So far so good.

30:10.343 --> 30:12.842
I see the Serpents and
the Poisons are in place.

30:12.845 --> 30:15.129
Now we just wait for the
Gargoyle King to make his move.

30:15.131 --> 30:17.971
Mmm-hmm. And you'll take
him down when he does.

30:18.592 --> 30:20.175
I mean, imagine, Jug.

30:22.078 --> 30:24.249
He may be in this gym right now.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.343
You want to dance while we look for him?

30:30.345 --> 30:33.439
- Before your coronation, Your Majesty.
- Mmm. Yes.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.928
From the back-to-school dance

30:39.930 --> 30:42.305
to the junior prom.

30:42.307 --> 30:43.741
How much has changed.

30:45.736 --> 30:47.161
Some things are still the same.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.247
True.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.458
Like my father.

30:52.460 --> 30:54.918
Hey, what's wrong?

30:56.205 --> 30:57.713
Before I came here tonight,

30:58.949 --> 31:01.449
Pop dropped a bombshell on me,

31:01.451 --> 31:04.118
and I'm still reeling.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.956
Apparently, I don't own the diner.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.883
My father does.

31:09.885 --> 31:11.376
And La Bonne Nuit, too.

31:11.378 --> 31:13.294
But you bought it from your dad.

31:13.296 --> 31:14.513
He tricked me.

31:14.515 --> 31:17.966
He gave me a fake deed
and kept the original.

31:17.968 --> 31:21.061
All this year, all this time,

31:21.063 --> 31:23.680
I've been working for my father.

31:23.682 --> 31:27.493
Everything I've made, I
put back into the business,

31:27.495 --> 31:28.905
back into his pockets.

31:28.908 --> 31:30.228
Does he know that you know?

31:30.230 --> 31:32.188
No.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.917
And I'm gonna act as
though nothing has changed.

31:34.919 --> 31:37.151
I'm gonna do exactly what he
would do in this situation,

31:37.153 --> 31:39.379
manipulate him into
digging his own grave.

31:40.490 --> 31:42.610
That's our way through this mess.

31:42.613 --> 31:43.926
"Our."

31:45.452 --> 31:47.870
I like hearing you say "our."

31:47.873 --> 31:49.833
- Reminds me of...
- The old days.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.861
Will you help me, Archie?

31:56.105 --> 31:59.406
And this time, we can take
down my father for good.

32:00.602 --> 32:02.083
Hell, yeah.

32:08.067 --> 32:11.685
I'm sorry you won't get
to be prom queen, babe.

32:11.688 --> 32:13.648
I know how important it was to you.

32:14.549 --> 32:15.873
It's okay, Tee-Tee.

32:17.193 --> 32:19.656
Edgar gave me something
better than a queenship.

32:20.622 --> 32:22.238
Humility.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.507
You can't mean that.

32:24.384 --> 32:26.700
No, you're right.

32:26.703 --> 32:28.795
I can't, and I don't.

32:28.797 --> 32:31.917
And suddenly, being a Farmie is
making a lot less sense to me.

32:37.906 --> 32:39.868
Are you the Gryphon Queen?

32:39.871 --> 32:41.512
This is for you.

32:43.571 --> 32:44.611
Who sent this?

32:45.722 --> 32:47.163
I got it from a Druid,

32:47.166 --> 32:50.325
who got it from a Centaur,
who got it from someone else.

32:57.524 --> 33:00.159
"To Her Majesty, the Gryphon Queen.

33:00.162 --> 33:03.496
You've been summoned to the place where
the first Ascension Night was held.

33:03.498 --> 33:04.676
Come alone.

33:04.679 --> 33:08.733
Tell anyone, and every reveler attending
the festival tonight will pay the price."

33:28.264 --> 33:32.567
Good evening, Riverdale
Renaissance Revelers.

33:32.569 --> 33:37.814
At long last, it's time to
announce this year's court.

33:37.816 --> 33:41.226
And the winner of prom queen...

33:42.445 --> 33:44.463
is Betty Cooper.

33:51.496 --> 33:52.915
Is Betty here?

33:58.169 --> 34:00.129
Hey, have either of you seen Betty?

35:01.733 --> 35:03.375
Not gonna happen.

35:28.310 --> 35:29.693
I did what you asked.

35:31.574 --> 35:32.988
I came here alone.

35:37.727 --> 35:38.869
What do you want?

35:42.742 --> 35:43.890
Who are you?

36:13.596 --> 36:15.637
Dad?

36:15.640 --> 36:16.961
Why are you doing this?

36:25.534 --> 36:27.367
Dad, you don't want to do this.

36:41.975 --> 36:43.725
Somebody help me!

38:35.613 --> 38:37.088
Betty? It's Jug.

38:40.743 --> 38:42.761
Did you see him? Did you see him?

38:42.763 --> 38:44.095
- Who, the Gargoyle King?
- No!

38:44.097 --> 38:47.220
The Black Hood. The
Black Hood is back, Jug.

38:54.686 --> 38:56.526
It was a setup, Jug.

38:59.396 --> 39:03.097
The Gospel that we found,
and the Proclamation,

39:03.099 --> 39:05.766
it was all to get me
alone with my dad again.

39:05.768 --> 39:07.601
I can't believe none
of us saw it coming,

39:07.603 --> 39:08.936
the return of the Black Hood.

39:08.938 --> 39:10.813
Now we have two serial
killers running around.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.572
Possibly working together.

39:12.575 --> 39:14.495
And both of them outsmarting us.

39:24.787 --> 39:27.413
It's really horrible,
what happened at the dance.

39:27.415 --> 39:30.308
I can't believe we were all in
the gym while that was going on.

39:30.310 --> 39:33.386
I'm gonna stay in Riverdale
a little longer, Archie.

39:33.388 --> 39:35.296
I don't want you alone
while your dad's away.

39:35.298 --> 39:37.056
Okay.

39:37.058 --> 39:38.898
That's great, Mom.

39:40.895 --> 39:43.738
I'm gonna go for a run, if that's cool.

39:43.740 --> 39:47.683
You're really committed to
this, aren't you? To boxing?

39:47.685 --> 39:51.082
Well, I tried music. I tried football.

39:51.085 --> 39:52.831
Well, the world is such a scary place.

39:52.833 --> 39:55.524
Maybe it's not the worst
thing to know how to fight.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.406
To be able to defend yourself.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.367
Do you mean that?

40:00.340 --> 40:02.831
If this is your path,

40:02.834 --> 40:04.649
I want to support it.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.177
And you.

40:06.179 --> 40:07.679
As long as you do it right.

40:07.681 --> 40:09.422
I promise, Mom.

40:09.424 --> 40:11.975
No more crash diets, double-bookings.

40:13.836 --> 40:15.343
Will you help me convince Dad?

40:20.550 --> 40:22.934
- Mom.
- Betty?

40:22.937 --> 40:25.096
- What are you doing here?
- Mom, listen to me.

40:25.098 --> 40:27.991
I was right. Dad escaped.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.484
He's back. I saw him.

40:29.486 --> 40:30.943
No, they confirmed he's dead.

40:30.945 --> 40:32.520
No, he survived.

40:32.522 --> 40:35.948
He chased me during prom.
He's killing people again.

40:35.950 --> 40:37.691
No, Betty, no. I left that all behind.

40:37.693 --> 40:40.119
Mom, you have to deal with this.

40:40.121 --> 40:42.738
Dad is back, and I think
he's coming here next.

40:42.740 --> 40:43.779
What?

40:43.782 --> 40:45.073
Why would he come here?

40:45.076 --> 40:47.034
'Cause I told him about
your engagement to Edgar

40:47.036 --> 40:48.720
and how he plans to adopt the twins,

40:48.722 --> 40:49.995
and he was really upset.

40:49.997 --> 40:51.747
Why were you talking to that monster?

40:51.749 --> 40:53.891
Because he fooled me!

40:53.894 --> 40:54.976
What do we do?

40:56.212 --> 40:57.625
You stay here.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.217
Our walls are strong, Betty.

41:03.219 --> 41:05.653
And our members stronger.

41:05.655 --> 41:08.323
Let the Farm protect you. Both of you.

41:11.352 --> 41:12.652
Will you stay?

41:22.660 --> 41:23.784
Yeah.
