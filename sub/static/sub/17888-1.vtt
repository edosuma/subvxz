12:48.544 --> 12:50.273
Easy, steady, steady.

12:51.492 --> 12:53.643
It doesn't look like she
wants to come to our party.

13:01.647 --> 13:03.406
Don't touch me!

Don't mind me, carry on.

14:48.948 --> 14:50.703
I was enjoying it.

14:50.738 --> 14:52.239
As if.

14:58.074 --> 14:59.652
Making eggs?

14:59.881 --> 15:01.145
No.

15:02.504 --> 15:04.277
What's the water for then?

15:06.222 --> 15:07.977
I'm making tea.

15:08.766 --> 15:09.548
Ok.

15:14.291 --> 15:15.896
I'm a friend of your mother.

15:17.329 --> 15:19.185
You dance like a black.

15:21.775 --> 15:22.853
It's a compliment.

15:22.888 --> 15:24.569
And what would you know?

15:25.826 --> 15:28.165
I watch videos like everyone else.

15:28.382 --> 15:31.215
And that makes you some
kind of expert does it?

15:32.706 --> 15:34.499
You've got a mouth on you.

15:40.850 --> 15:42.775
What should I call you anyway?

15:43.096 --> 15:44.606
Whatever you like.

15:48.826 --> 15:51.231
A charming personality you've got there.

16:13.141 --> 16:14.462
See you later.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.737
<i>I met your girl.</i>

16:34.772 --> 16:36.865
<i>She's not with the police?</i>

16:37.128 --> 16:38.808
<i>What a miracle.</i>

16:39.034 --> 16:41.585
<i>Oh look, you made me tea</i>

17:14.198 --> 17:15.917
What are you doing?

17:15.953 --> 17:17.604
Mind you own fuckface.

17:17.638 --> 17:20.589
If i'm a fuckface you're a cuntface.

17:41.355 --> 17:45.166
- Hello, what's this?
- A gate.

17:45.201 --> 17:48.063
A gate, can I get out?

17:48.098 --> 17:50.910
You have to put money in it
and the gate will open.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.506
- How much?
- 2 quid.

17:52.541 --> 17:54.906
2 quid?
Jesus, that's a tough fucking gate!

17:58.985 --> 18:00.212
Here you go then.

18:07.447 --> 18:08.727
Get off me!

18:08.762 --> 18:10.562
Get off me!
I want to spend the money!

18:10.597 --> 18:12.245
Only if you give me a discount.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.197
Alright then, a pound,
a pound you plank.

18:15.232 --> 18:17.026
Ok, fair dos.

18:21.506 --> 18:24.015
I like you, i'll kill you last.

18:27.157 --> 18:28.817
Tyler, get off me!

19:10.449 --> 19:13.355
That bloke said: "See you later".

19:14.762 --> 19:17.093
Is lover boy coming back?

19:18.735 --> 19:20.654
I'm having my firends round later.

19:20.689 --> 19:22.574
You can stay in your room or get out.

19:22.609 --> 19:24.462
No kids, the pair of you.

19:26.424 --> 19:29.895
What makes you think we wanna hang
about with your friends anyway?

19:29.930 --> 19:32.483
All those winos and skanks.

19:38.472 --> 19:40.982
Look at yourself, tramp.

19:44.718 --> 19:46.332
Bitch!

19:46.367 --> 19:48.616
I've got childline's
number if you need it.

19:48.651 --> 19:50.332
You're a bitch yourself!

20:21.557 --> 20:23.520
You've got a nerve coming back.

20:26.188 --> 20:27.735
Quiet!

20:29.134 --> 20:30.694
Good boy.

20:31.267 --> 20:33.626
You're lucky my brothers aren't here.

20:33.661 --> 20:35.663
They took my stuff.

20:53.641 --> 20:56.265
It's not what you think, this is old.

20:59.805 --> 21:02.504
Did you let that dog off
on purpose last night?

21:03.856 --> 21:05.441
He's strong.

21:06.110 --> 21:08.177
you're lucky you didn't get bitten.

21:08.212 --> 21:10.866
Yeah, lucky. Idiot..

21:15.396 --> 21:19.019
<i>My party's started but i'm
not arriving until i'm ready.</i>

21:20.604 --> 21:24.749
I don't know how they
can live on makeup.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.853
That must be her.

21:30.225 --> 21:31.451
Told you?

21:32.842 --> 21:35.993
Is that her mum or something?
Her mum's butters!

21:37.827 --> 21:39.110
They're mad!

21:40.974 --> 21:43.796
I don't like her smile,
she's got yellow teeth.

21:46.173 --> 21:48.212
More like green.

21:48.652 --> 21:51.201
Any more they'll end up going pink.

21:51.481 --> 21:53.750
I suppose that's how she wants them.

21:53.785 --> 21:58.993
<i>I think when I first step into the tent
and eyes are on me it'll be magical...</i>

21:59.028 --> 22:02.227
That cider is nice,
you've gotta agree with that.

22:02.262 --> 22:03.811
Too bad we've only got one.

22:04.038 --> 22:07.132
Oh my god, she's making
a fool of herself.

22:07.167 --> 22:10.511
She's a spoilt brat!

22:10.889 --> 22:12.287
- What a dog.
- Shut up Mia.

22:12.322 --> 22:15.803
Shut up yourself, i'm
going in a minute anyway.

22:18.616 --> 22:20.871
God, that is ridiculous.

22:20.906 --> 22:25.419
Why would they want to make a
fool of themselves and do that for?

22:47.152 --> 22:48.797
Alright darling.

22:48.832 --> 22:52.396
- You always such a donkey knob?
- I wish I did have a donkey knob.

22:52.431 --> 22:55.961
Then i could give up my stupid job.
Are you gonna let us in or what?

22:56.536 --> 22:58.525
I don't recognise you
with your clothes on?

22:58.560 --> 23:00.513
- Such a dick.
- I know.

23:08.572 --> 23:11.689
- Where you been? You're late.
- Well i'm here now aren't I?

23:11.724 --> 23:14.807
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I had to change didn't I?

23:18.161 --> 23:21.161
What did I tell you?
In you room.

26:02.708 --> 26:05.143
Do you think she
looks different asleep?

26:11.873 --> 26:14.457
- Just give her a prod.
- It's ok.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.572
- I've got her.
- You're soft you are.

26:19.807 --> 26:21.940
Her room's down the end.

28:29.928 --> 28:31.894
She treats me like i'm a little kid.

28:31.929 --> 28:33.960
Well you are a bit too
old to be kipping over.

28:33.995 --> 28:36.543
It's only because I got
kicked out of my old place.

28:45.068 --> 28:47.087
Get some clothes on Mia.

28:47.703 --> 28:49.459
I've got some clothes on.

28:49.893 --> 28:51.628
You're half naked.

28:57.826 --> 29:02.127
- You don't normally care.
- Yeah, well I do now so get dressed.

29:02.162 --> 29:04.090
Why are you talking different?

29:04.790 --> 29:07.073
- Shall we get a move on yeah?
- Where are you going?

29:07.108 --> 29:08.426
We're not going nowhere.

29:08.461 --> 29:11.443
Well why did you just say
"shall we get a move on?" then?

29:12.215 --> 29:14.296
Listen, we're only going for a drive.

29:14.331 --> 29:15.454
You want to come?

29:15.489 --> 29:16.996
- Yeah yeah.
- Both of you?

29:17.031 --> 29:19.524

- I do.

29:19.805 --> 29:24.750

- I don't care I still wanna come!

29:25.287 --> 29:27.269
Off you go then, get dressed.

29:28.098 --> 29:29.401
Thanks for that.

29:32.503 --> 29:35.860
- What about you?
- No, she won't wanna come.

29:36.849 --> 29:40.737
- We're leaving in 20 minutes.
- You got better things to do, right?

29:40.982 --> 29:43.568
Yeah alright, i'd love to come.

29:53.162 --> 29:55.882
- Where are we going?
- Yeah, where are we going?

29:55.917 --> 30:00.276
- The orphanage.
- How dare you, that's not nice is it?

30:00.786 --> 30:03.939
If we did you should've
at least had a shave.

30:03.974 --> 30:07.352
- Why's that?
- It would be more respectful for me.

30:07.589 --> 30:11.148
- Why, you don't like this?
- No. Too hairy.

30:11.833 --> 30:14.985
- I think you look good.
- Thank you.

30:17.870 --> 30:19.607
What is this?

30:20.615 --> 30:24.125
- You've got some weird shit here.
- Come off it.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.417
It is weird.

30:25.452 --> 30:27.669
You cannot call
Bobby Womack weird shit?

30:27.704 --> 30:30.562

- Old enough.

30:33.313 --> 30:37.126
Ok, it seems i'm gonna
have to educate you girls.

Yes ma'am.

30:53.272 --> 30:57.254
<i>All the leaves are brown</i>

31:01.670 --> 31:05.001

31:36.184 --> 31:40.080
<i>I passed along the way.</i>

31:42.290 --> 31:45.122
<i>Well I got down on my knees</i>

31:45.669 --> 31:48.499
<i>and I began to pray</i>

31:48.820 --> 31:52.934
<i>You know the

32:10.316 --> 32:13.233
Oh wicked!

32:13.268 --> 32:16.444
- I can see it.
- I can't see it now.

32:16.479 --> 32:19.621
- Yeah, you can't see it now.
- Look!

32:21.264 --> 32:24.236
Oh wicked. That's
really cool that is.

32:25.578 --> 32:29.126
What's your favourite animal? If
you could come back as any animal...

32:29.161 --> 32:31.542
- What would you like to be?
- Monkey.

32:31.577 --> 32:33.030
A white tiger.

32:33.065 --> 32:34.932
A white tiger. Yeah, a dog.

32:35.613 --> 32:38.504
What kind of dog?

32:38.539 --> 32:41.116
- You're a dog anyway.
- Shut up!

32:41.151 --> 32:43.659
Come on.
I'd come back as an eagle.

32:43.694 --> 32:47.104
All these other animals are on the
ground but wouldn't you want to fly?

32:47.139 --> 32:48.546
- No.
- No.

32:48.581 --> 32:51.580
- But then you got shot.
- Think about it, don't just say no.

32:51.615 --> 32:54.461
No coz you can get shot or something.

32:54.496 --> 32:56.488
I want to pick some berries.

32:56.523 --> 32:59.536

Hey lovebirds!

33:48.482 --> 33:50.249
Lovers!

33:50.918 --> 33:53.203
I'm funny huh.

33:54.501 --> 33:57.687
I bet there's like a million
fucking bugs in this grass.

34:10.918 --> 34:13.245
Stop!

34:13.627 --> 34:17.065
Oh look at that bug Mia!
Quick!

34:17.427 --> 34:21.782
Look at that!

34:22.588 --> 34:24.774
Oh my God it's got six legs, look.

34:24.809 --> 34:26.960
One, two, three, four, five, six.

34:29.335 --> 34:32.074

34:32.659 --> 34:35.451

34:53.760 --> 34:56.255
- I need some help.
- Oh get out of it.

34:56.291 --> 34:59.026
- Come back here otherwise
he'll push us in. - No way.

34:59.061 --> 35:01.127
No way!

35:01.683 --> 35:04.922
Look, people don't come here often.
Fish are stupid...

35:04.957 --> 35:07.946
- We'll get one easily.
- I'm watching.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.936
- So's she?
- Excellent, come here.

35:10.971 --> 35:13.356
Oh trust bloody Mia.

35:22.087 --> 35:23.863

35:24.683 --> 35:28.081

35:28.534 --> 35:30.704

35:37.136 --> 35:38.645
Good girl!

35:39.809 --> 35:42.755
Over here.
Move slowly.

35:43.118 --> 35:44.917
She can't swim!

35:51.284 --> 35:53.800
You're ugly feet will
scare those fish away?

35:53.835 --> 35:58.198
They'll think you're some kind of
ugly foot-fish come to get them.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.457
Move towards me slowly.

36:01.716 --> 36:05.909
Did it touch you? If it did
you'll get fish disease!

36:09.321 --> 36:11.746
Ok, do you see the
fish in front of you?

36:11.781 --> 36:14.602
I want you to move towards

Ok, move slowly.

Slippery little fucker!

37:26.574 --> 37:30.280

silly cow. What d'ya think it's doing?

37:33.263 --> 37:35.248
What are you doing?

37:40.231 --> 37:42.364

37:42.399 --> 37:44.199

I'm not even touching it, let

37:46.850 --> 37:49.008
You eat fish fingers don't you?
It's the same thing.

37:49.043 --> 37:51.561
No it's not. It's got a head
and eyes and nasty poo in it

37:51.596 --> 37:54.393

- I'll eat it.

37:54.428 --> 37:57.350

37:58.369 --> 38:01.226
Ugh, keep away! AIDS, AIDS!

38:04.561 --> 38:06.994
- Oh Christ!
- Let's take a look.

38:07.439 --> 38:09.587
You'll live.

38:13.509 --> 38:17.736
Mum hates blood. You'll

38:21.122 --> 38:23.577

38:24.489 --> 38:27.615
- There on your arm.
- Oh right?

38:27.891 --> 38:29.983
It's just an ex-girlfriend.

38:39.227 --> 38:41.107
There's a spider.

38:41.469 --> 38:42.746

38:43.944 --> 38:45.374

But you were gonna do us that fish.

40:07.887 --> 40:11.293
- You shouldn'y put up with

40:11.328 --> 40:14.700
- I'll run you home first.
- Can;t we stay for another drink?

40:14.735 --> 40:19.173

40:57.950 --> 41:00.568
I bet you can't danc this fast?

41:02.489 --> 41:05.858
- I've got no shoes on.
- Excuses, come on.

41:16.135 --> 41:18.590
That's no dancing.

41:18.923 --> 41:20.657
Come on girl!

41:41.442 --> 41:44.022
What the fuck are you doing?

41:45.027 --> 41:46.298

41:46.333 --> 41:48.647

41:48.682 --> 41:51.194
Oi, watch your mouth.

41:51.229 --> 41:53.706
I don't care, I haven't
got to like him have I?

41:54.410 --> 41:57.461
- I told you she'd spoil things.
- She doesn't mean it.

41:57.496 --> 42:01.370
I do, I don't like you! You act like
you know us after two fucking days!

42:01.405 --> 42:03.817
You don't fucking know us!

42:04.980 --> 42:09.125

42:30.761 --> 42:33.065
- Hi.

42:33.279 --> 42:35.469
It's alright, I like dogs.

42:35.504 --> 42:38.076
Don't worry if she
tears you arm off alright?!

42:40.287 --> 42:41.682
Mia.

42:46.587 --> 42:49.414
Mia, there's someone downstairs
who wants to talk to you.

42:52.099 --> 42:53.962

43:11.658 --> 43:14.133
- There she is.

43:16.620 --> 43:20.760
Hi, i'm Carrie. Is it alright if

43:20.795 --> 43:23.813

of England, what d'ya think?

43:24.628 --> 43:27.013
- Can I get a drink first?
- Yeah, of course.

43:27.700 --> 43:30.377
They've got you in that special school.

43:31.226 --> 43:34.313
When she was born she
wouldn't stop crying for days.

43:36.206 --> 43:38.666
It's like she came
out looking for trouble.

43:39.489 --> 43:43.560
- You've got another daughter too?
- Yeah, Tyler.

43:44.036 --> 43:46.412
She's going the same way.

43:46.713 --> 43:49.391
Won't be long before they
kick her out of school too.

43:49.426 --> 43:51.453
It's hard being on your own.

43:52.345 --> 43:54.583
You can say that again.

43:55.045 --> 43:59.794
This place she's going to...
what's it like?

44:01.243 --> 44:04.521
Is it far away. I ain't got a car.

44:05.226 --> 44:08.607
Mia!
Get back here now!

44:19.062 --> 44:22.161
<i>You trying to take the piss?</i>

44:23.802 --> 44:28.793
<i>I'm gonna go in this shop, when I
come out i'm gonna be different!</i>

44:28.828 --> 44:33.104
<i>Different! Hear me?
Diferrent!</i>

44:33.326 --> 44:37.421
<i>Different to anyone, different
to you, to the whole world!</i>

45:52.707 --> 45:56.463
- Fuck me, is there a bad smell
in here or what? - Fucking reeks.

45:56.498 --> 45:58.771
Smells like someone ain't
had a bath in time.

45:58.806 --> 46:01.795
Your eyes looking pretty bad,
did your dad miss your mouth?

46:01.830 --> 46:04.619
- Where do you think you're going?
- Who do you think you're pushing?

46:04.654 --> 46:07.548
Your right eye's gonna match your left!

46:07.583 --> 46:10.443
- Get out my fucking way!
- Fuck off!

46:49.801 --> 46:51.138
Hello.

46:52.503 --> 46:54.045
Just passing...

46:54.952 --> 46:58.782
- How did you know I worked here?
- You said.

47:01.666 --> 47:04.628
What's up? I thought you hated me.

47:05.851 --> 47:08.984
- You're a dry lunch.
- Lunch.

47:09.937 --> 47:11.351
It's alright.

47:12.725 --> 47:15.348
- How's the foot?
- It's ok.

47:20.045 --> 47:21.611
Hold on a minute.

47:35.678 --> 47:37.113
Take your shoe off.

47:38.514 --> 47:42.338
- I can do it.
- Well i'm gonna do better, come on.

48:02.191 --> 48:03.790
Do you ever wash your feet?

48:06.232 --> 48:07.474
Yes.

48:20.827 --> 48:23.905
There you go, good as new.

48:28.291 --> 48:30.324
So what are you doing
with yourself then?

48:35.140 --> 48:37.972
- Got some stuff planned.
- Yeah?

49:01.148 --> 49:04.483
- You gonna go for this then?
- Dunno, I might.

49:04.518 --> 49:06.256
Well you should do, you're great.

49:10.668 --> 49:14.163
- Don't tell mum though.
- What's it worth?

49:16.426 --> 49:18.857
- Do you need a camera?
- What?

49:19.140 --> 49:21.264
It says you need
to send something in.

49:21.299 --> 49:23.389
I've got a little camera if you want.

49:26.118 --> 49:29.759
- I'll give it to you on one condition.
- What's that?

49:31.354 --> 49:33.531
Just remember to smile when you do it.

49:33.566 --> 49:34.694
What?

49:34.946 --> 49:36.971
You look nice when you smile.

49:44.596 --> 49:47.630
I'd better get back to work.
I'll see you later.

49:47.665 --> 49:51.075
I'll be staying at yours for a bit.
Is that alright with you?

49:51.483 --> 49:54.697
- Has your mum kiced you out?
- Sort of.

50:24.835 --> 50:27.721
It's only me Tennents, stupid dog.

50:31.693 --> 50:33.236
Mia...

50:34.006 --> 50:37.406
Just because you run off doesn't
mean you can get away with it.

50:50.359 --> 50:53.368
You start at the referral
unit in two weeks.

51:02.066 --> 51:04.264
- Have you got that camera?
- Jesus!

51:04.562 --> 51:07.263
You made me jump.
Just a sec.

51:19.311 --> 51:21.337
Am I the best or what?

51:21.983 --> 51:23.544
Thanks.

51:32.568 --> 51:35.294
- How do you work it?
- It's easy.

51:43.253 --> 51:45.037
Turn it on here...

51:47.163 --> 51:49.353
Make sure the shutter is down.

51:49.650 --> 51:51.929
That red button is the record.

51:52.242 --> 51:54.414
Press that when you
want to film anything.

51:55.566 --> 51:57.482
Here, you'll get the hang of it easy.

51:58.310 --> 52:00.066
Sweet!

52:30.516 --> 52:32.383
What do you think?

52:37.056 --> 52:39.999

- Of course.

That's for sneaking up on me!
That's for being cheeky!

52:53.615 --> 52:55.897
That's for running away
from the social worker.

52:55.932 --> 52:59.268
- Connor!
- You got off lightly this time.

52:59.624 --> 53:01.547

- She'll get a good hiding if she does.

53:09.863 --> 53:11.353
Smells good.

53:18.561 --> 53:24.574

56:45.633 --> 56:48.246

58:16.674 --> 58:19.928

- You think that we starve her.

58:20.296 --> 58:24.493

59:55.640 --> 59:58.125
Well you don't see them often.

01:00:00.586 --> 01:00:02.729
They don't buckle easily in a smash.

01:00:11.176 --> 01:00:12.987
You want some of this?

01:00:16.211 --> 01:00:18.485

01:01:07.754 --> 01:01:10.836
Come on then, let's get wasted.

01:01:16.936 --> 01:01:20.137
Hold on.
That's it, stand up.

01:01:23.344 --> 01:01:25.062
Fucking hell.

01:02:14.541 --> 01:02:17.584
- Getcha!
- Get down.

01:02:20.997 --> 01:02:24.188
Get off me! Get off me!
Get down!

01:02:25.022 --> 01:02:28.268
- You're no fun.
- I'm supposed to be at work.

01:02:29.964 --> 01:02:31.530
What you after?

01:02:32.372 --> 01:02:35.735
- We need some money.
- Oh yeah?

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.041
- You drunk?
- No.

01:02:42.839 --> 01:02:44.375
Can I have a fiver?

01:02:44.437 --> 01:02:46.614
It's my job to throw
drunks out you know?

01:02:46.616 --> 01:02:50.358
- Oh come off it.
- Look, i've got no money on me.

01:02:53.396 --> 01:02:56.365
Look how skinny this boy is.

01:02:56.428 --> 01:02:58.587
We're starving, we need food.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.379
I'll pay you back.

01:03:15.654 --> 01:03:18.937
- I'm not a bloody kid you know!
- I know that.

01:04:11.016 --> 01:04:14.494
- Is there any dinner?
- It's a bit late for that now?

01:04:14.557 --> 01:04:16.763
What do you think this is, a café?

01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:38.908
<i>Thailand, anger?
I don't think so.</i>

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:42.088
<i>Japan, anger? No!
Russia...</i>

01:04:59.473 --> 01:05:02.962
- You still got my camera?
- You want it?

01:05:03.988 --> 01:05:06.014
As long as it's safe.

01:05:07.117 --> 01:05:08.608
It's safe.

01:05:17.846 --> 01:05:19.936
You going out with that boy then?

01:05:22.656 --> 01:05:24.713
Why?

01:05:26.575 --> 01:05:30.255
- He looked a bit old for you.
- He's 19.

01:05:31.479 --> 01:05:34.514
She's never had a boyfriend.

01:05:36.392 --> 01:05:38.620
Just fucked him upstairs actually.

01:05:38.683 --> 01:05:40.224
That's nice.

01:05:42.451 --> 01:05:44.225
You can talk.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:49.402
- Shall we go to bed?
- Yeah.

01:05:52.751 --> 01:05:55.545
Come on to bed Sleeping Beauty.

01:06:03.652 --> 01:06:06.479
It's about your new school,
you get to stay there.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.484
You can fuck as many ASBO
boys as you like now.

01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:30.031
That was clever.

01:06:30.637 --> 01:06:31.780
I ain't going.

01:06:31.843 --> 01:06:34.213
That place might
teach you some manners.

01:06:34.377 --> 01:06:36.529
It's nothing to do with you, is it?.

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:42.064
- You need sorting out you do.
- So you keep saying.

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:45.437
But you're nothing to me
so why should I listen?

01:07:17.894 --> 01:07:20.765
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

01:07:23.116 --> 01:07:26.264
<i>Oh my God, he's
just so easy going.</i>

01:07:33.807 --> 01:07:37.525
<i>I knew it when I
saw him, I just knew.</i>

01:07:39.115 --> 01:07:41.550
Oh fuck off, as if I am.

01:07:42.965 --> 01:07:44.865
No i'm not.

01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:47.490
You know they're only
good for one thing,

01:07:47.552 --> 01:07:50.803
and he is fucking excellent at that!

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:54.369
I know.

01:07:57.229 --> 01:08:01.759
I know, I know, don't worry
babe, you'll meet someone.

01:08:02.192 --> 01:08:03.835
Yeah, of course.

01:08:04.266 --> 01:08:06.972
Are you going to
Anne-Marie's thing tonight?

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.096
9, right?

01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:15.689
Alright then babes, see you later!

01:08:20.524 --> 01:08:23.491
<i>You have one new message.</i>

01:08:23.671 --> 01:08:27.792
<i>This is a message for Mia
Williams, you sent us your video.</i>

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:30.795
<i>We wondered if you'd like to
come in for an audition next week?</i>

01:08:31.037 --> 01:08:35.792
<i>Give us a call back
on 01708665001.</i>

01:08:35.856 --> 01:08:37.384
<i>Oh, it's Val by the way.</i>

01:10:54.464 --> 01:10:56.454
Put your arm round me.

01:10:56.812 --> 01:11:00.051
Hang on, the other arm.

01:11:03.788 --> 01:11:06.890
- Up the stairs, that's it.
- My baby...

01:11:07.151 --> 01:11:10.028
- I bloody love you.
- I know.

01:11:10.858 --> 01:11:14.723
I'm going to sleep. You'll
be around in the morning?

01:11:14.785 --> 01:11:18.933
Be a big girl, 
I'll be around in the morning.

01:11:19.568 --> 01:11:22.770
- You promise me yeah?
- I promise you.

01:12:14.486 --> 01:12:17.806
- You're up late?
- I've been busy.

01:12:25.916 --> 01:12:29.048
- Are you my friend now?
- What?

01:12:31.154 --> 01:12:33.852
You seemed a bit funny with
me the last few days.

01:12:33.853 --> 01:12:36.517
You've been funny with me.

01:12:36.933 --> 01:12:38.423
Have I?

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.842
Maybe.

01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:58.519
- Your mum's passed out.
- She does that.

01:13:03.144 --> 01:13:06.353
You all love your booze
in this family don't you?

01:13:13.768 --> 01:13:15.857
Your hair looks nice down.

01:13:16.253 --> 01:13:20.274
Better than the
ponytail you usually have.

01:13:24.139 --> 01:13:28.291
- I've got myself an audition.
- Good girl.

01:13:30.897 --> 01:13:32.956
No surprise in that one.

01:13:36.604 --> 01:13:38.927
I borrowed one of your CDs.

01:13:39.431 --> 01:13:43.164
- What sound did you pick?
- "California Dreamin'".

01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:46.620
The one you put on in the car.

01:13:46.915 --> 01:13:49.739
That's my favourite song ever.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.132
- Do you want to show me?
- No way!

01:13:57.415 --> 01:14:01.023
Come on, if you can't do
it in front of me now,

01:14:01.359 --> 01:14:04.419
how are you gonna do it in
front of all those people?

01:14:04.645 --> 01:14:08.514
Anyway, I think you're great already.
You know that?

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.697
I only worked it out tonight.

01:14:12.601 --> 01:14:15.174
- It ain't ready really.
- Alright.

01:14:15.637 --> 01:14:17.523
Just thought I could help.

01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.269
It's your call.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.006
That's all i've got so far.

01:16:51.594 --> 01:16:53.092
Come here.

01:17:00.274 --> 01:17:01.678
Come here.

01:17:13.207 --> 01:17:14.889
That was really good.

01:17:18.232 --> 01:17:21.621
- You're just saying that.
- No, i'm serious.

01:17:22.582 --> 01:17:25.615
If it was up to me
i'd give you the job.

01:19:18.823 --> 01:19:22.830
I bet it doesn't feel liek this
with that boy of yours does it?

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:24.290
No.

01:19:37.562 --> 01:19:39.661
Is his cock this big?

01:20:21.853 --> 01:20:23.600
I'm pissed.

01:20:28.703 --> 01:20:30.563
That was all avoidable.

01:20:31.645 --> 01:20:33.249
No it weren't.

01:20:44.766 --> 01:20:47.270
We have to keep this
between you and me.

01:20:48.797 --> 01:20:50.422
Yeah, I know.

01:21:21.924 --> 01:21:23.962
I'd better get off to bed.

01:21:25.156 --> 01:21:26.923
I'm wasted.

01:21:32.485 --> 01:21:35.177
We'll talk tomorrow, yeah?

01:22:27.554 --> 01:22:29.356
Connor's gone.

01:23:05.785 --> 01:23:07.689
Connor!

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.616
Connor!

01:23:30.228 --> 01:23:32.545
Did I tell you I nearly had you aborted?

01:23:35.542 --> 01:23:37.729
I even made an appointment.

01:23:50.654 --> 01:23:52.823
Are you gonna phone him?

01:23:58.051 --> 01:24:00.768
- He won't come back.
- You don't know nothing.

01:24:01.064 --> 01:24:03.413
I know what you did,
i'm telling mum.

01:24:03.475 --> 01:24:05.425
I don't care what you do.

01:24:16.976 --> 01:24:19.844
<i>This is Connor, leave us a
message and i'll get back to you.</i>

01:24:24.301 --> 01:24:26.914
<i>This is Connor, leave us a message...</i>

<i>- I was just coming to look for you.
- Wickes, Barking, how may I help you?</i>

01:24:49.188 --> 01:24:52.335

No, i've got some personal shit
to deal with, i'll see you later.

01:25:57.042 --> 01:25:59.325
Excuse me, Danton Road?

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:03.322

estate, it's on the right. - Thanks.

01:27:28.087 --> 01:27:31.295
Jesus Christ!
Come on!

01:27:32.283 --> 01:27:33.555
Come on!

01:27:37.036 --> 01:27:40.527
Look, I don't know how you found
me here but this isn't a good idea.

01:27:40.911 --> 01:27:44.386
- You're not answering your phone.
- My battery's dead.

01:27:46.787 --> 01:27:50.322
- I was gonna call you.
- You ain't even got my number.

01:27:55.137 --> 01:27:59.213
- You know I like you Mia.
- Well why did you leave then?

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:07.355
You know why.

01:28:08.724 --> 01:28:10.864
Mia, you're 15 years old!

01:28:11.516 --> 01:28:14.347
What does it matter
if you like someone?

01:28:18.154 --> 01:28:20.539

01:28:20.602 --> 01:28:22.977

I've got no money.

01:29:33.983 --> 01:29:36.455
That should be enough to get you back.

01:29:59.152 --> 01:30:01.187

01:42:10.336 --> 01:42:12.694
You stupid little girl!

Anyone can do that!

01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:19.021
Keira!

We had to shoot her.

01:52:47.833 --> 01:52:50.059
She was 16.

01:52:51.939 --> 01:52:53.332
