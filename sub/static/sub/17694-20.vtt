(<i> jazz music plays</i> )

00:15.282 --> 00:18.150
When I joined the C.I.A.,
I knew the deal.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.519
If we make a mistake,
we cover it up,

00:20.521 --> 00:23.355
like the time Dick accidentally
created feline AIDS,

00:23.357 --> 00:26.492
and we covered it up
by blaming it on gay cats.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.193
But this was different.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.763
This was too big to cover.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.199
<i> And Bullock wanted blood.</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:37.336
Now, I'm only going
to say this once.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.905
I love Christmas!

00:39.907 --> 00:43.242
Okay, two numbers left
in the Evil Santa gift swap.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.077
Number 13.

00:46.013 --> 00:48.147
Davenport, choose a gift
from the table

00:48.149 --> 00:50.382
or take someone else's.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.485
The Nicolas Cage stickers
and tin of breadsticks thing is

00:53.487 --> 00:56.455
still extremely available
for a steal.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.859
(laughter)

01:00.861 --> 01:02.561
(chuckles)
Tough luck, Duper.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.029
Anyway, Davenport,
you're up.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.931
Uh, I'll pick.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.000
We have a picker!

01:11.572 --> 01:14.206
It's a pizza-slice
sleeping bag!

01:14.208 --> 01:16.275
And the crust is
a sewn-in pillow.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.010
He'll be king
of the sleepover!

01:18.012 --> 01:20.179
(all chant
"Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!")

01:20.181 --> 01:21.513
A winning gift!

01:21.515 --> 01:23.415
Unlike the breadsticks,

01:23.417 --> 01:26.418
which have effectively taken
Duper out of the game.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.288
(laughter)

01:29.290 --> 01:32.458
Still, it gave everyone else
the gift of laughter --

01:32.460 --> 01:35.627
in a way,
the only true gift.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.830
Okay, my turn.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.868
Hmm, The torture variety pack
is tempting --

01:42.870 --> 01:47.072
heretic's fork, metal spanker,
anal-tarring brush.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.273
It's a barbecue set.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.442
But who needs
two of anything?

01:50.444 --> 01:51.677
I shall pick.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.784
Wait, t-there should be
a gift here.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.552
There's no gift for me.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.055
But -- but that means

02:03.057 --> 02:04.323
someone didn't bring one!

02:04.325 --> 02:06.158
What?!
Impossible!

02:06.160 --> 02:07.326
It can't be!

02:08.796 --> 02:10.229
Who didn't bring a gift?

02:10.231 --> 02:12.998
And don't try to sell me
on the gift of laughter,

02:13.000 --> 02:14.299
'cause that's horse shit!

too close to it,

All right,
I'll get you out.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.008
But you have
to listen carefully,

09:03.010 --> 09:05.043
and you're gonna have
to lie a bit more.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.378
If it ends this,

09:06.380 --> 09:08.747
I'm in your hands.

that choked Lisa Bonet

a few crucial phases

The first phase is
believe the lie.

so you've been stalling,

You would never do that
on a real case.
I know.

to bring in someone else.

what's gonna happen.

this case means to you,

one thing straight --

not for the cops,

09:45.085 --> 09:47.085
not for him,

Sorry, I was fired up,
so I came in

09:50.624 --> 09:52.424
and just kind of went
into it.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.526
Don't worry, Smith.
I heard everything.
Carry on.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.963
a satellite team
in Bogotá.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.131
Yes!
I love this new energy.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.767
The entire C.I.A. is
at your disposal.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.869
Does that include
the Starbucks in the lobby --

10:04.871 --> 10:06.471
specifically
the employees,

10:06.473 --> 10:07.939
specifically Greg?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.207
Uhh...

10:09.209 --> 10:11.476
you can have Kevin,

10:11.478 --> 10:13.278
but not Greg.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.214
(indistinct conversations)

10:16.216 --> 10:17.983
Bye, Jim.
Bye, Liz.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.784
You better expect
a call on Monday

10:19.786 --> 10:21.786
for that
lemon-bar recipe.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.489
Boy, your parents are
super rad.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.225
Steve, you were great.
My parents loved you.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.060
Have fun at the dance.
Huh?

10:29.062 --> 10:31.796
Wait, did I forget
to tell you the plan?

10:31.798 --> 10:34.633
My parents won't let me date
a sexy bad boy like Wyatt,

10:34.635 --> 10:36.735
so I used you,
a sexless good boy,

10:36.737 --> 10:38.937
to get
out of the house.

10:38.939 --> 10:42.574
She's 14 and you're,
like, 25, buddy!

10:42.576 --> 10:46.411
Good luck picking a movie
that you both agree on!

10:46.413 --> 10:47.646
(grunts weakly)

10:49.116 --> 10:51.249
We just saw
what she did.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.084
Yeah, go ahead.
Laugh it up.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.519
No.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.288
We were wondering --
Would you do that for us?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.357
My parents hate
my boyfriend, too.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.825
I'll even pay you.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.095
Will you be
our "widdle" good boy, Steve?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.498
(thinking)<i> Hmm,</i>
<i> a good boy front.</i>

11:06.500 --> 11:09.601
<i> So, first I get the money,</i>
<i>then I get the motorcycle --</i>

11:09.603 --> 11:11.970
after<i> I take</i>
<i>the responsible riders course.</i>

11:11.972 --> 11:14.806
<i> Then, I'll be</i>
<i>the responsible, sexy bad boy!</i>

11:14.808 --> 11:16.775
<i> Ladies,</i>
<i> we're in business.</i>

11:18.445 --> 11:19.678
So...

11:19.680 --> 11:21.579
will you do it?
Hm?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.150
I can't believe
this worked!

11:25.152 --> 11:26.351
What a rush!

11:26.353 --> 11:28.486
The joy of getting away
with a lie

11:28.488 --> 11:30.989
is better than
a million helping-peoples.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.793
Now it's on to phase two
of lying -- benefits.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.333
I don't understand
this phase.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.135
Should we be looking
for something?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.537
The view, Stan.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.972
We use a helicopter
for the "investigation,"

11:47.974 --> 11:50.341
but we're really
enjoying the views.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.376
The views?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.677
Now you're getting it!

11:52.679 --> 11:54.679
And this is just one
of many benefits.

11:54.681 --> 11:55.914
The next is Eat Day.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.816
Eat Day is
just what it sounds like.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.317
Then there's Bone Day.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.653
You just wake up
and start plowing babes all day.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.154
I'm not doing that.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.090
I just want everything normal
at work again.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.391
Ugh, fine.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.393
We'll go straight
to the last phase --

12:08.395 --> 12:10.095
the blame phase.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.164
What --
What are you doing, Stan?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.433
Looking for the words.
The words usually appear.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.202
Yeah...okay.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.204
Oh, my God,
I think I'm losing it!

12:19.206 --> 12:21.506
Check your jacket pocket.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.907
No!

12:24.511 --> 12:26.845
(singsong voice)
The blame phase!

12:26.847 --> 12:28.880
To accept blame.
Of course.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.516
I knew eventually
I'd have to fess up.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.784
Accept -- Huh?

12:32.786 --> 12:34.352
No! You just blame it
on someone else.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.020
I can't blame
another agent.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.722
Okay, well,
not a living agent.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.058
People in the C.I.A. die
all the time, right?

12:40.060 --> 12:42.360
So, wait for the next one
and pin it on them.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.262
That's -- That's actually
a good idea.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.197
What do you mean,
actually a good idea?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.966
You say that like
I don't have good ideas.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.467
I always have good ideas.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.370
I am by far the most creative
person in the family!

12:52.372 --> 12:53.404
Okay, okay.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.706
Okay yourself, guy.

12:54.708 --> 12:57.475
Sorry, sorry.
I'm -- I'm truly sorry.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.644
(sighs)
Let's just forget about it.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.947
(sighs)

13:02.949 --> 13:05.717
I feel like
I undersold Bone Day.

13:05.719 --> 13:09.020
¶¶

13:41.688 --> 13:44.289
Thanks for not trying
anything, Steve!

13:44.291 --> 13:46.324
And I never will!

13:49.696 --> 13:51.462
You asked
to see me, sir?

13:51.464 --> 13:54.032
Tell me something good, Smith.
I need it.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.300
Something good.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.702
Uh, Big Daddy Jeff
and the Stooge

13:57.704 --> 13:59.204
are back on FM 93.1.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.939
I guess the Stooge
isn't going to prison.

14:00.941 --> 14:04.142
A weight lifted,
and my heart needs it.

14:04.144 --> 14:07.779
Agent Davenport died
on a mission last night.

14:07.781 --> 14:11.649
Sir, um, I know
the timing of this is tough,

14:11.651 --> 14:15.353
but, well, I closed the case
this morning.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.721
It was Agent Davenport

14:16.723 --> 14:18.489
who didn't bring a gift
to Evil Santa.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.958
Smith,
are you quite sure?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.793
I am.

14:21.795 --> 14:25.196
Maybe he knew I was close
and took it into his own hands.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.399
By tying himself up
and being shot several times

14:28.401 --> 14:30.802
through the trunk
of an old Fiat.

14:30.804 --> 14:32.337
Yes, that makes sense.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.371
But why --

14:33.373 --> 14:34.873
He was still
a great agent.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.407
The best way to honor him

14:36.409 --> 14:39.143
is to not look
for any soft spots in my story.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.712
You're right.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.916
You can pay
for your Steve date experience

14:44.918 --> 14:46.217
with cash or credit.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.319
She wants to know
if we'll accept

14:48.321 --> 14:50.855
a video of her
getting her nipples pierced.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.491
Yeah, look, Jessica,
Steve would love to escort you

14:53.493 --> 14:54.926
to the Winter Formal,

14:54.928 --> 14:56.995
but I'm looking
and there's nothing available.

14:56.997 --> 15:00.298
You know what, for you,
let me talk to my manager.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.004
Oh, my God,
this never happens.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.672
He's making room
for you.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.608
I cannot stress to you
how much this never happens.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.077
If you were to expect this
in the future,

15:13.079 --> 15:15.079
you would be insane.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.584
You're really going to enjoy
our Steve Silver Package.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.252
It's a drop-off,
a picture,

15:21.254 --> 15:23.788
and I'll talk to your dad
about model airplanes.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.057
Oh, Steve,
you're so nice.

15:26.059 --> 15:29.427
It's -- It's making me
so horny for Trevor.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.596
Oh, you're one
of Trevor's girls.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.966
Yeah, he's been hitting it
pretty hard since his divorce.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.403
We're gathered here today
to honor a man,

15:38.405 --> 15:40.038
Wallace Davenport.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.440
I think you actually
got me out of this.
Actually?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.442
What -- What the hell
is your problem, man?

15:44.444 --> 15:48.212
Beloved husband,
devoted father, and...

15:48.214 --> 15:50.581
(crying)

15:50.583 --> 15:52.750
Oh, I just can't do it!

15:52.752 --> 15:55.787
How dare you cry
for this man?

15:55.789 --> 15:58.289
He didn't bring a gift
to Evil Santa!

15:58.291 --> 15:59.324
(all gasp)

15:59.326 --> 16:01.259
I'm not sure if there is a hell,

16:01.261 --> 16:03.761
but if there is one,
Davenport's there,

16:03.763 --> 16:06.464
wrapping an empty box
in his own flayed skin

16:06.466 --> 16:07.598
for all eternity!

16:07.600 --> 16:09.167
But he brought
a poker set.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.469
Shh! You're --
You're delirious with grief.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.504
That was me.
I brought the poker set.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.506
-He was a coward!
-He was a traitor!

16:15.508 --> 16:17.342
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
people, please.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.743
Can't we just bury the man

16:18.745 --> 16:20.678
and all the issues
surrounding him?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.348
You'll never see
a dime of his pension.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.516
But we'll lose
everything.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.251
This has gone too far.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.988
Stan, can't you see
no one's getting hurt here?

16:29.990 --> 16:33.691
I declare
prima nocta!

16:37.464 --> 16:38.496
(crying)

16:38.498 --> 16:40.331
We're never
gonna make it

16:40.333 --> 16:42.800
with Bullock
taking the pension away.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.769
Katie's medication
alone...

16:44.771 --> 16:46.137
(coughs)

16:46.139 --> 16:48.272
And Katie's --
Katie's absolutely essential?

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
You know what,
forget it.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.909
I guarantee
you'll have that pension.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.280
Roger, I just promised
the C.I.A.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.483
would pay
Davenport's pension.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.817
Oh, bad lie, Stan.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.285
Not a Roger-sanctioned lie.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.353
But it is a lie,

17:02.355 --> 17:04.155
so don't be too hard
on yourself.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.324
-How am I gonna pay her?
-It's simple.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.193
You get a night job to support
your new secret family.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.361
I know a great place.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.729
Ace Crouton!

17:11.731 --> 17:13.631
You were supposed to find
my missing kid!

17:13.633 --> 17:15.199
And I'm looking
for him.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.234
<i> Her.</i>

17:16.236 --> 17:17.835
Oh, a clue!

17:17.837 --> 17:20.238
¶¶

17:20.240 --> 17:21.406
(camera clicks)

17:21.408 --> 17:22.807
Great.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.976
Now go on and get felt up
by a delinquent.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.177
He's not coming.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.312
He just texted me.
He's sick.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.882
(coughs)
Tony's sick, too.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.217
Wyatt's dead.
(sneezes)

17:33.219 --> 17:36.320
Steve, do you have
that hanky on you?

17:36.322 --> 17:39.991
No. Unfortunately I don't,
tonight of all nights.

17:39.993 --> 17:43.027
Center for Disease Control!
Nobody move!

17:43.029 --> 17:44.228
(device beeps)

17:44.230 --> 17:45.663
-(screaming)
-What's going on?!

17:45.665 --> 17:48.533
(device beeping rapidly)

17:48.535 --> 17:49.901
Right here.
Hot zone.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.104
Aah! I confess!

17:53.106 --> 17:55.706
I'm a good boy
for hire!

17:55.708 --> 17:56.874
(device pings)

17:56.876 --> 17:58.176
Sir, he's telling
the truth.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.577
Who cares?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.412
There's been an outbreak
of conquistador measles,

18:01.414 --> 18:03.781
and levels are off the chart
around this kid.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.917
(device buzzes)

18:05.919 --> 18:08.019
Mother of God.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.791
Wait, why didn't
I get sick?

18:13.793 --> 18:17.228
Conquistador measles doesn't
infect the sexually immature.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.431
Pfft. A class-5 virus
going after a dweeb like you?

18:20.433 --> 18:21.966
Please.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.768
But it could still like me
as a friend, right?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.403
And maybe one day,

18:25.405 --> 18:27.939
it could grow into something
more than friendship?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.913
(cellphone vibrates)

18:35.915 --> 18:38.382
Stan, are you
working late again?

18:38.384 --> 18:41.385
I need you here to explain
Kimmel's jokes.

18:41.387 --> 18:44.956
You know how the C.I.A.
is this time of year with...

18:44.958 --> 18:47.258
Toyota days
around the corner?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.960
Got to go,
big mission.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.761
Stan,
no personal calls!

18:50.763 --> 18:53.664
Last warning if you want
to keep getting paid.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.633
Wait, this is all?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.435
Any chance
I could get an advance

18:57.437 --> 18:59.003
on my next
10 year's salary?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.605
What do I look like,
a bank?

19:00.607 --> 19:03.975
No. Not really.

19:06.346 --> 19:10.481
One bank,
then the widow's good for life.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.683
Two banks.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.652
My body's full of money.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.888
(banjo playing)

19:29.269 --> 19:31.736
(banjo slows, distorts)

19:39.812 --> 19:42.180
Stan?
What are you doing here?

19:42.182 --> 19:44.782
Roger?
You -- you sell sperm, too?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.185
<i> Sell?</i>

19:47.187 --> 19:48.486
Hey, you look like me.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.354
This is crazy.
I got to get a pic.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.622
(camera clicks)

19:51.624 --> 19:53.057
Twinsies!

19:53.059 --> 19:57.061
God, look at me.
Look at what I've become.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.063
Lying has turned me

19:59.065 --> 20:01.832
into a horrible,
grotesque monster.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.134
(gasps)

20:03.136 --> 20:04.702
Well, you're not
having any trouble

20:04.704 --> 20:06.737
with brutal honesty
right now!

20:06.739 --> 20:08.873
I'm just not built
to be a liar.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.875
No, you're built
to be a jerk!

20:10.877 --> 20:12.210
(crying)

20:12.212 --> 20:13.945
Double my order!

20:16.482 --> 20:20.384
So, you didn't bring a gift,
led a fraudulent investigation,

20:20.386 --> 20:23.321
had me desecrate
a fellow agent's funeral,

20:23.323 --> 20:24.889
then sold your plasma
and semen

20:24.891 --> 20:26.691
until you were
at the brink of death?

20:26.693 --> 20:27.725
That's the gist.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.060
(sighs)

20:29.062 --> 20:31.062
I think the lesson
is obvious, Smith.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.330
It is.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.098
I'm a better man
when I'm honest.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.767
Also, you never really
escape a lie.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.936
Even if you get away
with it.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.504
Geez!

20:40.506 --> 20:44.208
The lesson is to bring
a bloody gift to Evil Santa.

20:44.210 --> 20:47.845
A mistake I'm sure
you didn't make this year.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.880
¶¶

20:49.882 --> 20:52.416
Uh...

20:52.418 --> 20:53.751
Get it?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.920
This bozo's right back
where he started.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.089
Merry Christmas
from our family to yours!

20:58.091 --> 21:00.524
Wait a minute,
is this our Christmas episode?

21:00.526 --> 21:02.126
What month is this?

21:02.128 --> 21:04.095
Bye-bye!
See you soon!

21:04.097 --> 21:07.999
