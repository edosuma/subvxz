>> John: WELCOME,

00:34.533 --> 00:35.233
WELCOME, WELCOME

00:35.233 --> 00:36.100
TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:36.100 --> 00:36.633
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.633 --> 00:37.133
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:37.133 --> 00:39.734
FOR JOINING US.

00:39.734 --> 00:40.934
AND LET'S DIVE RIGHT IN WITH

00:40.934 --> 00:42.567
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:42.567 --> 00:43.333
THE "BACHELOR IN PARADISE" OF

00:43.333 --> 00:45.567
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.800
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE TO

00:46.800 --> 00:47.433
START WITH THE FACT THAT ON

00:47.433 --> 00:48.800
THURSDAY, THE PRESIDENT SENT A

00:48.800 --> 00:51.033
SERIES OF DISGUSTING TWEETS

00:51.033 --> 00:52.233
ABOUT "MORNING JOE'S" MIKA

00:52.233 --> 00:53.000
BRZEZINSKI, TWEETS THAT WERE

00:53.000 --> 00:55.300
ABSOLUTELY INDEFENSIBLE.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.967
AND YET, WHITE HOUSE PRESS

00:56.967 --> 00:57.633
SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE

00:57.633 --> 00:58.900
SANDERS,

00:58.900 --> 01:00.333
THE LEAST AMUSING CAST MEMBER IN

01:00.333 --> 01:02.000
A DIRECT-TO-DVD FAITH-BASED

01:02.000 --> 01:03.400
ROMANTIC COMEDY, GAVE IT HER

01:03.400 --> 01:05.934
BEST SHOT.

01:05.934 --> 01:07.467
>> I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT

01:07.467 --> 01:10.033
HAS BEEN ATTACKED MERCILESSLY ON

01:10.033 --> 01:12.433
PERSONAL ACCOUNTS BY MEMBERS ON

01:12.433 --> 01:13.867
THAT PROGRAM, AND I THINK HE HAS

01:13.867 --> 01:15.567
BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT WHEN HE

01:15.567 --> 01:16.767
GETS ATTACKED, HE'S GONNA HIT

01:16.767 --> 01:18.367
BACK.

01:18.367 --> 01:19.233
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:19.233 --> 01:20.700
SHE'S KIND OF RIGHT:

01:20.700 --> 01:22.233
TRUMP IS BASICALLY A WALRUS

01:22.233 --> 01:23.867
WEARING A T-SHIRT THAT SAYS

01:23.867 --> 01:25.967
"I HAVE DIARRHEA!"

01:25.967 --> 01:27.133
HE'S PRETTY OPEN ABOUT HOW

01:27.133 --> 01:29.633
GROSSLY SHITTY HE CAN BE.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.400
SO WE CAN'T BE SURPRISED

01:31.400 --> 01:32.867
WHEN HE IS.

01:32.867 --> 01:33.867
BUT THAT NEWS ACTUALLY

01:33.867 --> 01:35.000
OVERSHADOWED A DEVELOPMENT

01:35.000 --> 01:35.533
REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S

01:35.533 --> 01:36.734
TRAVEL BAN, WHICH THE

01:36.734 --> 01:37.700
ADMINISTRATION HAS LONG

01:37.700 --> 01:39.600
MAINTAINED IS NOT A BAN DESPITE

01:39.600 --> 01:40.900
WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM

01:40.900 --> 01:43.967
BIASED MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS

01:43.967 --> 01:44.934
LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

01:44.934 --> 01:47.767
STATES AND THE DICTIONARY.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.033
YOU MAY REMEMBER TRUMP'S

01:49.033 --> 01:50.133
ORIGINAL EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:50.133 --> 01:51.834
"HALTED ALL REFUGEE ADMISSIONS

01:51.834 --> 01:53.667
AND TEMPORARILY BARRED PEOPLE

01:53.667 --> 01:54.600
FROM SEVEN MUSLIM-MAJORITY

01:54.600 --> 01:55.767
COUNTRIES."

01:55.767 --> 01:56.967
IT WAS MET WITH WIDESPREAD

01:56.967 --> 01:58.166
PROTESTS AND DOZENS OF

01:58.166 --> 02:00.467
LAWSUITS, RESULTING IN COURTS

02:00.467 --> 02:01.867
PLACING BOTH THE BAN AND TRUMP'S

02:01.867 --> 02:03.100
SUBSEQUENT REVISION OF THAT BAN

02:03.100 --> 02:04.500
ON HOLD.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.533
AND THIS WEEK, THE SUPREME COURT

02:05.533 --> 02:08.500
WEIGHED IN.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.567
>> THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS

02:09.567 --> 02:11.467
RULED TO PARTIALLY REINSTATE THE

02:11.467 --> 02:12.967
PRESIDENT'S HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL

02:12.967 --> 02:14.734
TRAVEL BAN BEFORE HEARING

02:14.734 --> 02:15.667
ARGUMENTS ON THE CASE IN

02:15.667 --> 02:17.600
OCTOBER.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.533
>> John: YES, AT FIRST THE BAN

02:18.533 --> 02:20.066
WAS BANNED, BUT NOW THE COURT

02:20.066 --> 02:20.867
HAS PARTIALLY BANNED THE

02:20.867 --> 02:23.433
BAN-BAN, INSTITUTING A PARTIAL

02:23.433 --> 02:25.066
BAN PENDING THE POSSIBILITY OF A

02:25.066 --> 02:27.934
FUTURE PARTIAL-BAN BAN.

02:27.934 --> 02:29.000
NOW, THE COURT DID IMPOSE SOME

02:29.000 --> 02:30.433
RESTRICTIONS, SAYING IT COULDN'T

02:30.433 --> 02:31.900
APPLY TO ANYONE WITH "A CREDIBLE

02:31.900 --> 02:33.100
CLAIM OF A BONA FIDE

02:33.100 --> 02:35.066
RELATIONSHIP WITH A PERSON OR

02:35.066 --> 02:37.400
ENTITY IN THE UNITED STATES."

02:37.400 --> 02:39.400
SO THE NATURAL QUESTION IS,

02:39.400 --> 02:40.533
WHAT CONSTITUTES

02:40.533 --> 02:42.467
A "BONA FIDE RELATIONSHIP?"

02:42.467 --> 02:44.066
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

02:44.066 --> 02:47.033
TOOK A SWING AT ANSWERING THAT.

02:47.033 --> 02:47.633
>> THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS

02:47.633 --> 02:48.767
NARROWLY DEFINED THAT AS A

02:48.767 --> 02:50.166
PARENT OR CHILD, INCLUDING

02:50.166 --> 02:54.967
IN-LAWS, A SIBLING OR A SPOUSE.

02:54.967 --> 02:55.600
THE GUIDELINES FOR WHO IS

02:55.600 --> 02:56.633
CONSIDERED CLOSE FAMILY DOES NOT

02:56.633 --> 02:58.300
INCLUDE GRANDPARENTS, AUNTS OR

02:58.300 --> 03:00.233
UNCLES, NIECES OR NEPHEWS,

03:00.233 --> 03:02.033
COUSINS, AND BROTHERS OR

03:02.033 --> 03:03.800
SISTERS-IN-LAW.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.266
>> John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

03:05.266 --> 03:06.200
GRANDPARENTS AREN'T CLOSE

03:06.200 --> 03:11.133
FAMILY?

03:11.133 --> 03:13.600
GOOD LUCK TELLING THEM THAT!

03:13.600 --> 03:15.066
THAT WOULD REQUIRE CALLING THEM.

03:15.066 --> 03:15.633
WHICH WOULD MEAN A 12 OR 13

03:15.633 --> 03:16.266
MINUTE CONVERSATION AT MINIMUM,

03:16.266 --> 03:16.800
A CONVERSATION THAT WOULD

03:16.800 --> 03:18.567
INEVITABLY INVOLVE BEING ASKED

03:18.567 --> 03:19.233
WHETHER YOU REMEMBER JERRY

03:19.233 --> 03:20.567
FLAXMAN.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.200
YOU KNOW, JERRY FLAXMAN WHO USED

03:22.200 --> 03:23.333
TO LIVE DOWN THE STREET.

03:23.333 --> 03:23.900
JERRY.

03:23.900 --> 03:24.834
FLAXMAN.

03:24.834 --> 03:25.700
YOU REMEMBER HIM.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.300
HE HAD THE DAUGHTER WITH

03:28.300 --> 03:28.934
THE INTERNET BUSINESS AND SHE'S

03:28.934 --> 03:29.934
GAY NOW?

03:29.934 --> 03:30.500
FLAXMAN.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.100
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

03:31.100 --> 03:31.667
JAMIE?

03:31.667 --> 03:32.734
EITHER JAMIE OR AMANDA.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.667
RIGHT, RIGHT, SAMANATHA FLAXMAN.

03:34.667 --> 03:35.600
ANYWAY, HER FATHER IS JERRY

03:35.600 --> 03:36.800
FLAXMAN.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.734
AND, WELL, HE'S DEAD.

03:41.734 --> 03:42.467
AND WHILE THE DEFINITION IS

03:42.467 --> 03:44.266
RIDICULOUS, THE IMPACTS OF THIS

03:44.266 --> 03:45.967
BAN ARE VERY REAL, PARTICULARLY

03:45.967 --> 03:47.000
FOR REFUGEES, SINCE THE

03:47.000 --> 03:48.333
ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED THAT

03:48.333 --> 03:49.967
BEING ASSISTED BY A

03:49.967 --> 03:51.500
REFUGEE-RESETTLEMENT AGENCY DOES

03:51.500 --> 03:53.400
NOT CONSTITUTE A BONA FIDE

03:53.400 --> 03:54.667
RELATIONSHIP.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.734
WHICH MEANS THOUSANDS OF

03:55.734 --> 03:57.467
DESPERATE PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE

03:57.467 --> 03:59.467
THROUGH EXHAUSTIVE VETTING AND

03:59.467 --> 04:02.567
BEEN APPROVED TO COME HERE HAVE

04:02.567 --> 04:07.333
NOW BEEN LEFT IN THE LURCH.

04:07.333 --> 04:07.967
WHICH IS SHAMEFUL.

04:07.967 --> 04:08.567
AND YET, FOR SOME, IT'S NO BIG

04:08.567 --> 04:09.233
DEAL.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.166
AN ATTITUDE BEST EXEMPLIFIED BY

04:11.166 --> 04:12.900
HUMAN LACROSSE STICK TUCKER

04:12.900 --> 04:14.333
CARLSON, WHO ASKED --

04:14.333 --> 04:15.467
#Tucker --

04:15.467 --> 04:16.633
WHY DOES AMERICA BENEFIT FROM

04:16.633 --> 04:18.066
HAVING TONS OF PEOPLE FROM

04:18.066 --> 04:19.867
FAILING COUNTRIES COME HERE?

04:19.867 --> 04:21.533
A QUESTION THAT MADE THE STATUE

04:21.533 --> 04:23.734
OF LIBERTY GIVE UP AND DROWN

04:23.734 --> 04:26.166
HERSELF IN THE HUDSON RIVER.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.633
AND IF I MAY POINT OUT, TUCKS,

04:28.633 --> 04:33.033
JUST BECAUSE A NATION IS

04:33.033 --> 04:33.800
FAILING DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T

04:33.800 --> 04:35.166
PRODUCE SOME AMAZING PEOPLE.

04:35.166 --> 04:35.767
JUST AS -- AND I THINK WE ALL

04:35.767 --> 04:38.033
KNOW WHO EXHIBIT A FOR THIS IS

04:38.033 --> 04:39.166
-- A SUCCESSFUL NATION CAN

04:39.166 --> 04:40.500
PRODUCE SOME FAILED HUMAN

04:40.500 --> 04:42.033
BEINGS.

04:42.033 --> 04:46.767
#Tucker.

04:46.767 --> 04:47.834
AND LOOK, THIS BAN IS CRUEL,

04:47.834 --> 04:48.633
IT'S UNNECESSARY, AND IT

04:48.633 --> 04:49.600
UNDERMINES OUR STANDING

04:49.600 --> 04:51.233
IN THE WORLD.

04:51.233 --> 04:52.734
SO YOU'D THINK THE PRESIDENT

04:52.734 --> 04:53.500
WOULD AT LEAST BE JUSTIFYING ITS

04:53.500 --> 04:54.734
EXISTENCE.

04:54.734 --> 04:55.700
INSTEAD, HE KEEPS DERAILING THE

04:55.700 --> 04:58.100
CONVERSATION WITH HIS BARRAGE OF

04:58.100 --> 04:59.400
BULLSHIT.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.133
AND THERE'S NO BETTER EXAMPLE

05:01.133 --> 05:02.467
THAN THE FACT THAT, JUST THIS

05:02.467 --> 05:03.467
MORNING,

05:03.467 --> 05:04.767
ABC'S "THIS WEEK" HAD A HOMELAND

05:04.767 --> 05:06.467
SECURITY ADVISER ON TO DISCUSS

05:06.467 --> 05:08.133
THE BAN, BUT THEY NEVER GOT

05:08.133 --> 05:09.300
AROUND TO IT, BECAUSE THEY HAD

05:09.300 --> 05:11.166
TO ADDRESS YET ANOTHER UNHINGED

05:11.166 --> 05:12.500
TWEET.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.700
AND JUST WATCH THE GUY'S FACE AS

05:14.700 --> 05:16.133
HE REALIZES WHAT HE'S ABOUT TO

05:16.133 --> 05:17.967
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT.

05:17.967 --> 05:19.200
>> I WANT TO GET TO SECURITY

05:19.200 --> 05:21.367
QUESTIONS AND SECURITY CONCERNS,

05:21.367 --> 05:24.000
BUT WE'VE JUST HAD THE PRESIDENT

05:24.000 --> 05:24.934
TWEET A GIF THAT I WANT YOU TO

05:24.934 --> 05:26.967
TAKE A LOOK AT.

05:26.967 --> 05:43.100
YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT THERE.

05:43.100 --> 05:43.633
OBVIOUSLY PRESIDENT TRUMP

05:43.934 --> 05:46.000
HAS TAKEN SOME VIDEO AND PUT

05:46.000 --> 05:47.433
A CNN MIC LOGO ON

05:47.433 --> 05:51.033
WHO HE'S BEATING UP.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.000
>> John: AT THIS POINT,

05:52.000 --> 05:52.600
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ADMIT

05:52.600 --> 05:53.633
THAT TRUMP WAS RIGHT.

05:53.633 --> 05:54.800
THERE IS AT LEAST ONE

05:54.800 --> 05:56.500
GRANDPARENT WHO POSES A GRAVE

05:56.500 --> 05:58.600
AND IMMEDIATE THREAT TO AMERICA.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.934
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE

05:59.934 --> 06:00.667
GRANDPARENT CURRENTLY IN CHARGE

06:00.667 --> 06:02.967
OF IT.

06:02.967 --> 06:09.266
AND NOW THIS.

06:09.266 --> 06:10.800
HIGH >> Announcer: I NOW

06:10.800 --> 06:13.000
METEOROLOGIST JOHN ELLIOTT

06:13.000 --> 06:15.033
ENGAGES IN A BIT TOO MUCH

06:15.033 --> 06:15.600
SELF-DEPRECATION.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.800
>> I'VE BEEN CAST AS THE WACKY

06:17.800 --> 06:18.633
REDHEAD FOR YEARS.

06:18.633 --> 06:20.967
I'M KIND OF STUFF.

06:20.967 --> 06:27.000
YES, "DIARRHEA OF A WIMPY KID"

06:27.000 --> 06:28.166
HE HAD GREAT SUCCESS.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.233
>> I DID NOT LIKE HOMECOMING

06:30.233 --> 06:30.533
DANCE.

06:30.533 --> 06:33.266
I HAD TO BEG JANET TO GO WITH

06:33.266 --> 06:34.600
ME, AND THEN SARAH.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.266
SHE COULDN'T GET ADDRESS THE

06:36.266 --> 06:36.834
SECOND YEAR.

06:36.834 --> 06:39.200
WHEN THE PACKAGE IS THIS BORN,

06:39.200 --> 06:41.000
NO ONE CARES WHAT'S INSIDE.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.266
THEY TESTED ME.

06:42.266 --> 06:45.033
THEY SAID I WAS STERN,

06:45.033 --> 06:45.600
UNAPPROACHABLE, AND HAD NO

06:45.600 --> 06:47.834
FUTURE IN TELEVISION.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.333
GRAVITY GETS YOU EVERY TIME.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.667
TAKE IT FOR ME, THE LEPRECHAUN.

06:50.667 --> 06:53.433
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE TO DO?

06:53.433 --> 06:54.700
IN THE ELEVATOR, TOTAL

06:54.700 --> 06:55.600
STRANGERS.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.033
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?

06:57.033 --> 06:58.033
THEY CAN'T LEAVE.

06:58.033 --> 07:00.400
HAVE SOME FUN AND SAY HI TO

07:00.400 --> 07:01.367
FOLKS.

07:01.367 --> 07:03.500
MY WIFE DOES NOT LIKE MY CARGO

07:03.500 --> 07:04.367
SHORTS.

07:04.367 --> 07:05.567
>> John: MOVING ON.

07:05.567 --> 07:06.433
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:06.433 --> 07:07.633
LOCAL NEWS.

07:07.633 --> 07:08.467
IT'S MOSTLY KNOWN FOR

07:08.467 --> 07:09.734
INFORMATIVE AND HARD-HITTING

07:09.734 --> 07:12.066
SEGMENTS LIKE THIS ONE.

07:12.066 --> 07:13.133
>> POLICE SAY ONE OF THE MASKED

07:13.133 --> 07:14.700
SUSPECTS, ARMED WITH A HAND GUN,

07:14.700 --> 07:16.133
GOT OUT OF HIS CAR, WALKED UP TO

07:16.133 --> 07:17.433
THE VICTIM'S WINDOW, POINTED THE

07:17.433 --> 07:19.333
GUN RIGHT AT HER FACE, AND TOLD

07:19.333 --> 07:20.467
HER HE WANTED HER PURSE, HER

07:20.467 --> 07:25.900
MONEY, AND HER CELL PHONE.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.233
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

07:27.233 --> 07:27.867
YOU GOTTA HAND IT TO HIM.

07:27.867 --> 07:28.600
THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO MAKE

07:28.600 --> 07:29.800
PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO A STORY

07:29.800 --> 07:32.033
THEY MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED IN.

07:32.033 --> 07:33.500
WITH THAT IN MIND,

07:33.500 --> 07:35.133
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:35.133 --> 07:37.433
THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS IN

07:37.433 --> 07:38.166
CORPORATE CONSOLIDATION

07:38.166 --> 07:39.333
OF LOCAL NEWS.

07:39.333 --> 07:39.834
DON'T YOU DARE

07:39.834 --> 07:43.500
CHANGE THE CHANNEL.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.333
NATIONAL CABLE NEWS GETS A LOT

07:44.333 --> 07:45.533
OF ATTENTION, WITH THEIR BIG

07:45.533 --> 07:47.066
BUDGETS AND FANCY GRAPHICS

07:47.066 --> 07:48.166
PACKAGES.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.367
MEANWHILE, LOCAL NEWS OFTEN HAS

07:49.367 --> 07:51.166
TO DO A LOT MORE WITH A LOT

07:51.166 --> 07:52.633
LESS.

07:52.633 --> 07:55.467
>> THE BLACK BEAR WAS ROAMING

07:55.467 --> 07:56.266
THROUGH TINA MERRISON'S

07:56.266 --> 07:56.934
BACK YARD.

07:56.934 --> 07:57.633
TINA WAS TOO STUNNED TO GET A

07:57.633 --> 07:58.667
PICTURE BUT THIS IS WHAT THE

07:58.667 --> 07:59.800
BEAR PROBABLY LOOKED LIKE,

07:59.800 --> 08:01.467
EXCEPT REAL.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.600
THIS RECREATION IDENTIFIES HOW

08:02.600 --> 08:04.000
WITNESSES SAY THE BEAR ESCAPED

08:04.000 --> 08:07.400
INTO THE WOODS.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.400
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.033
WHOEVER IS HIDING BEHIND THAT

08:10.033 --> 08:10.800
TINY BEAR CUTOUT DESERVES

08:10.800 --> 08:13.066
A PULITZER.

08:13.066 --> 08:14.433
SURE, HE COULD HAVE STOOD UP AND

08:14.433 --> 08:16.200
JUST WALKED THE BEAR ACROSS THE

08:16.200 --> 08:17.567
GARDEN AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

08:17.567 --> 08:18.600
EXACTLY AS CONVINCING.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.200
BUT HE DIDN'T.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.333
HE HUNCHED DOWN

08:21.333 --> 08:23.033
BECAUSE HE CARES.

08:23.033 --> 08:26.200
THAT MAN IS A JOURNALIST.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.967
AND LOOK, IT'S EASY TO MAKE FUN,

08:28.967 --> 08:30.033
BUT LOCAL NEWS FILLS AN

08:30.033 --> 08:31.667
IMPORTANT ROLE, FINDING STORIES

08:31.667 --> 08:32.333
THAT THE NATIONAL NEWS

08:32.333 --> 08:33.934
IS MISSING.

08:33.934 --> 08:34.734
THIS SHOW USES LOCAL NEWS

08:34.734 --> 08:36.467
ALL THE TIME.

08:36.467 --> 08:38.133
OUR CIVIL FORFEITURE PIECE

08:38.133 --> 08:42.266
USED OUTSTANDING REPORTING FROM

08:42.266 --> 08:43.467
TENNESSEE'S NEWS CHANNEL 5,

08:43.467 --> 08:44.133
AND OUR PIECE ON PROBLEMS WITH

08:44.133 --> 08:45.066
911 USED GREAT WORK FROM

08:45.066 --> 08:46.100
ATLANTA'S "11 ALIVE."

08:46.100 --> 08:47.367
IN FACT, A PEW STUDY LAST YEAR

08:47.367 --> 08:48.333
FOUND THAT LOCAL NEWS

08:48.333 --> 08:49.333
IS TRUSTED MORE THAN NATIONAL

08:49.333 --> 08:51.400
NEWS.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.066
PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.133
SO, YES, WHEN YOU WATCH LOCAL

08:54.133 --> 08:55.433
NEWS, YOU MAY SEE SOMETHING

08:55.433 --> 08:56.633
SILLY.

08:56.633 --> 08:57.734
BUT YOU ALSO MAY SEE SOMETHING

08:57.734 --> 08:58.800
GREAT.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.967
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A THIRD

08:59.967 --> 09:00.967
OPTION.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.233
BECAUSE IN SOME PARTS OF THE

09:02.233 --> 09:04.333
COUNTRY, YOU MIGHT SEE THIS.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.100
>> I'VE GOT A MESSAGE

09:05.100 --> 09:07.367
FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS.

09:07.367 --> 09:08.967
LISTEN UP CLOSELY, SNOWFLAKE.

09:08.967 --> 09:10.700
YES, I'M TALKING TO YOU.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.600
YOU, THE SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIOR

09:12.600 --> 09:13.834
WHO WHINES FOR TRIGGER WARNINGS

09:13.834 --> 09:16.000
AND SAFE SPACES.

09:16.000 --> 09:16.834
NOT GROWN-UP ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH

09:16.834 --> 09:18.266
THE FACTS?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.066
THEN HUNKER DOWN IN YOUR ROOM

09:20.066 --> 09:22.467
AND SNAPCHAT THE DAY AWAY WITH

09:22.467 --> 09:24.266
OTHER SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIORS.

09:24.266 --> 09:25.200
COLLEGE ISN'T A BABYSITTING

09:25.200 --> 09:26.567
SERVICE.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.367
IT'S TIME TO GROW UP, SNOWFLAKE.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.600
>> John: THAT MAN IS MARK HYMAN,

09:32.600 --> 09:34.533
WITH ONE IN WHAT I PRESUME IS A

09:34.533 --> 09:36.500
SERIES FEATURING TITLES LIKE,

09:36.500 --> 09:38.066
"WAKE UP, LIBTARD,"

09:38.066 --> 09:39.800
"CUCKED MUCH, YA LITTLE BETA

09:39.800 --> 09:40.266
BABY?"

09:40.266 --> 09:41.400
AND "KNOCK KNOCK, SHEEPLE, IT'S

09:41.400 --> 09:43.767
ME, TRUTH" WITH MARK HYMAN.

09:43.767 --> 09:44.467
HYMAN IS A COMMENTATOR AND

09:44.467 --> 09:45.533
FORMER EXECUTIVE AT

09:45.533 --> 09:47.400
SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.867
AND SINCLAIR MAY BE THE MOST

09:48.867 --> 09:50.800
INFLUENTIAL MEDIA COMPANY YOU'VE

09:50.800 --> 09:52.100
NEVER HEARD OF.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.300
NOT ONLY ARE THEY THE LARGEST

09:53.300 --> 09:54.600
OWNER OF LOCAL TV STATIONS IN

09:54.600 --> 09:56.200
THE COUNTRY, THEY COULD SOON GET

09:56.200 --> 09:58.500
EVEN BIGGER.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.700
>> SINCLAIR WILL PAY ABOUT

09:59.700 --> 10:01.600
$4 BILLION FOR TRIBUNE MEDIA AND

10:01.600 --> 10:04.367
ITS 42 LOCAL STATIONS.

10:04.367 --> 10:05.166
THE COMBINED COMPANIES WILL

10:05.166 --> 10:08.200
CREATE THE LARGEST SINGLE GROUP

10:08.200 --> 10:09.100
OF TELEVISION STATIONS IN

10:09.100 --> 10:09.767
THE NATION.

10:09.767 --> 10:10.633
>> John: WOW.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.066
IT'S A LITTLE DISCONCERTING TO

10:12.066 --> 10:13.600
LEARN THAT SOMETHING YOU'VE ONLY

10:13.600 --> 10:15.433
JUST HEARD OF IS THROWING AROUND

10:15.433 --> 10:16.900
$4 BILLION.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.100
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT THAT

10:18.100 --> 10:19.834
EXXON MOBIL JUST GOT BOUGHT, AND

10:19.834 --> 10:21.667
IT WAS BY THE LITTLE TWERP WHO

10:21.667 --> 10:22.367
PLAYS THE NEW SPIDERMAN.

10:22.367 --> 10:27.767
WHAT?

10:27.767 --> 10:30.633
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

10:30.633 --> 10:31.200
HOW DOES SPIDER-TWERP HAVE

10:31.200 --> 10:31.734
THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT?

10:31.734 --> 10:32.266
I ONLY JUST FOUND OUT HE

10:32.266 --> 10:32.767
EXISTED!

10:32.767 --> 10:35.233
NOW, THIS ACQUISITION STILL

10:35.233 --> 10:35.800
NEEDS REGULATORY APPROVAL,

10:35.800 --> 10:36.433
BUT IT'S WIDELY ASSUMED THAT'LL

10:36.433 --> 10:37.266
HAPPEN.

10:37.266 --> 10:38.000
AT WHICH POINT, SINCLAIR'S REACH

10:38.000 --> 10:39.967
COULD EXPAND DRAMATICALLY.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.567
WE DID SOME MATH, AND FOUND THAT

10:41.567 --> 10:42.633
WHEN YOU COMBINE THE

10:42.633 --> 10:44.166
MOST-WATCHED NIGHTLY NEWSCASTS

10:44.166 --> 10:45.900
ON SINCLAIR AND TRIBUNE STATIONS

10:45.900 --> 10:46.767
IN SOME OF THEIR LARGEST

10:46.767 --> 10:47.800
MARKETS, YOU GET AN AVERAGE

10:47.800 --> 10:49.667
TOTAL VIEWERSHIP OF

10:49.667 --> 10:51.667
2.2 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.400
AND THAT IS A LOT.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.667
IT'S MORE THAN ANY CURRENT PRIME

10:55.667 --> 10:57.900
TIME SHOW ON FOX NEWS, INCLUDING

10:57.900 --> 10:59.367
"FIVE IDIOTS HAVE THE MOST

10:59.367 --> 11:01.467
INTOLERABLE DINNER PARTY EVER"

11:01.467 --> 11:02.333
AND "THAT GUY FROM COLLEGE

11:02.333 --> 11:03.900
EVERYONE HATED HAS A TALK SHOW

11:03.900 --> 11:06.600
NOW WITH TUCKER CARLSON".

11:06.600 --> 11:07.533
AND THE FOX PARALLELS

11:07.533 --> 11:08.333
DON'T STOP THERE.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.100
BECAUSE SINCLAIR'S CONTENT TILTS

11:10.100 --> 11:11.633
NOTICEABLY CONSERVATIVE.

11:11.633 --> 11:13.433
REMEMBER THE SNOWFLAKE GUY?

11:13.433 --> 11:15.133
SINCLAIR PRODUCES THOSE SEGMENTS

11:15.133 --> 11:16.000
AND SENDS THEM TO THEIR

11:16.000 --> 11:17.500
AFFILIATES.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.934
AND THAT IN ITSELF IS ALREADY

11:18.934 --> 11:20.133
UNUSUAL.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.834
AS BEST WE CAN TELL, NO OTHER

11:21.834 --> 11:24.033
MAJOR OWNER OF TV STATIONS

11:24.033 --> 11:25.600
DISTRIBUTES ITS OWN COMMENTARY

11:25.600 --> 11:26.367
SEGMENTS TO RUN DURING LOCAL

11:26.367 --> 11:28.300
NEWS.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.033
AND HYMAN'S OPINIONS

11:29.033 --> 11:32.633
HEW HARD-RIGHT.

11:32.633 --> 11:33.266
>> WE ARE THREATENED BY A NASTY

11:33.266 --> 11:33.934
CANCER EPIDEMIC.

11:33.934 --> 11:35.367
IT'S A DANGER TO OUR NATION.

11:35.367 --> 11:36.367
IT IS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS

11:36.367 --> 11:38.400
AND MULTICULTURALISM.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.934
WORDS THAT WERE ONCE ACCEPTABLE

11:40.934 --> 11:42.934
IN POLITE CONVERSATION

11:42.934 --> 11:43.834
ARE NO LONGER.

11:43.834 --> 11:44.467
"HANDICAPPED" AND "RETARDED" ARE

11:44.467 --> 11:45.100
NOW OFF LIMITS.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.100
THERE IS ONE STEP THAT'S PROVEN

11:46.100 --> 11:47.033
TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE DOMESTIC

11:47.033 --> 11:48.500
VIOLENCE.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.867
MARRIAGE.

11:50.867 --> 11:51.633
I AM NOW A PROUD WASHINGTON

11:51.633 --> 11:52.367
REDSKINS FAN.

11:52.367 --> 11:53.500
AND THE OPINION THAT ONLY BLACK

11:53.500 --> 11:54.166
PEOPLE CAN LEGITIMATELY HAVE AN

11:54.166 --> 11:55.633
AFRO?

11:55.633 --> 11:57.700
SOMEONE SHOULD TELL THAT TO

11:57.700 --> 11:58.600
AMERICAN FOLK SINGER

11:58.600 --> 12:01.734
ART GARFUNKEL.

12:01.734 --> 12:02.433
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

12:02.433 --> 12:04.033
ABOUT?

12:04.033 --> 12:05.233
AS I BELIEVE PAUL SIMON

12:05.233 --> 12:06.166
ONCE SAID, "THERE'S NO NEED TO

12:06.166 --> 12:07.633
INVOLVE ART GARFUNKEL IN ANY OF

12:07.633 --> 12:13.800
THIS."

12:13.800 --> 12:15.166
AND THE THINGS IS, HYMAN IS NOT

12:15.166 --> 12:15.734
SINCLAIR'S

12:15.734 --> 12:16.433
ONLY CONSERVATIVE VOICE.

12:16.433 --> 12:18.767
JUST RECENTLY, THEY HIRED A MAN

12:18.767 --> 12:20.066
NAMED BORIS EPSHTEYN, A FORMER

12:20.066 --> 12:20.800
TRUMP ADVISOR, WHO YOU MIGHT

12:20.800 --> 12:21.867
REMEMBER FROM

12:21.867 --> 12:22.767
MULTIPLE TV APPEARANCES LAST

12:22.767 --> 12:23.934
YEAR, WHERE HE MADE WILD CLAIMS

12:23.934 --> 12:25.667
LIKE THIS ONE.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.166
>> BARACK OBAMA MAY HAVE WON IN

12:27.166 --> 12:28.533
2008 NORTH CAROLINA DUE TO

12:28.533 --> 12:29.300
ILLEGAL VOTING.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.633
>> OH, MY GOD!

12:30.633 --> 12:31.367
>> BORIS, WHERE ARE YOU GETTING

12:31.367 --> 12:32.800
THAT FROM?

12:32.800 --> 12:33.967
BARACK OBAMA WON IN NORTH

12:33.967 --> 12:35.567
CAROLINA BECAUSE OF VOTER FRAUD?

12:35.567 --> 12:37.100
>> 5% OF VOTING IN NORTH

12:37.100 --> 12:38.200
CAROLINA MAY HAVE BEEN BY PEOPLE

12:38.200 --> 12:39.367
WHO ARE NON-CITIZENS WHO

12:39.367 --> 12:41.333
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN VOTING AND

12:41.333 --> 12:42.100
SWUNG NORTH CAROLINA

12:42.100 --> 12:44.433
TO MR. OBAMA.

12:44.433 --> 12:45.633
>> John: OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS

12:45.633 --> 12:48.300
NOTHING EVEN RESEMBLING A FACT.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.633
THE CLAIM HE'S MAKING RECEIVED A

12:49.633 --> 12:52.033
"PANTS ON FIRE" FROM POLITIFACT.

12:52.033 --> 12:54.233
AND EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE --

12:54.233 --> 12:55.066
WHICH, AGAIN, IT ISN'T --

12:55.066 --> 12:56.033
OBAMA STILL WOULD HAVE BEAT

12:56.033 --> 12:58.400
McCAIN BY 177 ELECTORAL VOTES.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.734
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION:

12:59.734 --> 13:00.867
DO TRUMP SURROGATES EVEN KNOW

13:00.867 --> 13:03.400
WHY THEY'RE LYING?

13:03.400 --> 13:07.266
OR ARE THEY DRIVEN BY SOME VAGUE

13:07.266 --> 13:09.767
INSTINCT, LIKE WHEN

13:09.767 --> 13:11.000
A CAT SITS INSIDE A BOX?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.300
"WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?"

13:12.300 --> 13:13.166
"I HAVE NO IDEA.

13:13.166 --> 13:13.800
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING INSIDE ME

13:13.800 --> 13:23.100
THAT TELLS ME I SHOULD."

13:23.100 --> 13:23.800
AND YET, HE IS NOW SINCLAIR'S

13:23.800 --> 13:24.633
CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST AND HAS

13:24.633 --> 13:25.533
A REGULAR SEGMENT CALLED "BOTTOM

13:25.533 --> 13:26.333
LINE WITH BORIS."

13:26.333 --> 13:26.934
LET ME SHOW YOU A RECENT ONE,

13:26.934 --> 13:27.567
CONCERNING A RETRACTED STORY ON

13:27.567 --> 13:29.133
CNN.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.533
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS.

13:30.533 --> 13:31.800
CNN, ALONG WITH OTHER CABLE NEWS

13:31.800 --> 13:33.200
NETWORKS, IS STRUGGLING TO STICK

13:33.200 --> 13:35.166
TO THE FACTS AND TO BE IMPARTIAL

13:35.166 --> 13:37.166
IN COVERING POLITICS IN GENERAL

13:37.166 --> 13:41.967
AND THIS PRESIDENT SPECIFICALLY.

13:41.967 --> 13:42.800
>> John: OH, COME ON.

13:42.800 --> 13:43.500
THAT COULDN'T BE MORE POT

13:43.500 --> 13:44.533
CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK IF HE

13:44.533 --> 13:47.200
SAID "THE BOTTOM LINE IS, CNN IS

13:47.200 --> 13:47.734
A REJECTED EXTRA FROM "THE

13:47.734 --> 13:49.934
SOPRANOS" IN A JCPENNEY'S TIE

13:49.934 --> 13:50.767
WHOSE VOICE SOUNDS LIKE

13:50.767 --> 13:51.934
SYLVESTER STALLONE WITH A MOUTH

13:51.934 --> 13:56.166
FULL OF BEES.

13:56.166 --> 13:56.867
BUT SINCLAIR DOESN'T JUST LEAN

13:56.867 --> 13:58.400
RIGHT WITH ITS COMMENTATORS.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.533
EVEN ITS AD BREAKS SOMETIMES PUT

13:59.533 --> 14:01.700
A THUMB ON THE SCALE.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.700
IN 2010, SINCLAIR'S PITTSBURGH

14:04.700 --> 14:05.467
AFFILIATE PULLED A 30-SECOND

14:05.467 --> 14:07.367
DEMOCRATIC AD OFF THE AIR AFTER

14:07.367 --> 14:08.600
THEY RECEIVED A COMPLAINT AND

14:08.600 --> 14:10.600
FOUND THAT SOME CLAIMS IN THE AD

14:10.600 --> 14:12.867
WERE UNSUBSTANTIATED.

14:12.867 --> 14:14.133
AND LOOK, IT'S A GOOD THING THEY

14:14.133 --> 14:15.133
WERE WILLING TO TAKE A STAND TO

14:15.133 --> 14:17.133
ENSURE NOTHING INACCURATE MADE

14:17.133 --> 14:18.367
ITS WAY ON-AIR.

14:18.367 --> 14:20.800
ALTHOUGH JUST A FEW MONTHS

14:20.800 --> 14:22.533
LATER, THAT EXACT SAME STATION,

14:22.533 --> 14:23.500
AND MULTIPLE OTHER SINCLAIR

14:23.500 --> 14:25.500
OUTLETS, AIRED A 25-MINUTE

14:25.500 --> 14:27.934
ATTACK AD ON DEMOCRATS,

14:27.934 --> 14:29.834
FEATURING ASSERTIONS LIKE THIS.

14:29.834 --> 14:30.867
>> DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL

14:30.867 --> 14:32.166
ELECTION, HE WOUND UP WITH A

14:32.166 --> 14:34.767
RECORD-SHATTERING $750 MILLION

14:34.767 --> 14:36.734
IN HIS CAMPAIGN.

14:36.734 --> 14:38.500
TO THIS DAY, HE REFUSES TO

14:38.500 --> 14:40.700
REPORT FROM WHENCE IT CAME.

14:40.700 --> 14:41.767
ONE REASON MIGHT BE THAT SOME OF

14:41.767 --> 14:43.533
IT ORIGINATED FROM THE TERRORIST

14:43.533 --> 14:48.633
GROUP HAMAS.

14:48.633 --> 14:49.567
>> John: OH, MY GOD.

14:49.567 --> 14:50.533
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE UP SCARY

14:50.533 --> 14:53.600
DONORS TO THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN,

14:53.600 --> 14:55.300
WHY STOP WITH HAMAS.

14:55.300 --> 14:55.767
KEEP GOING.

14:55.767 --> 14:56.367
"HE WON'T SAY WHERE THE MONEY

14:56.367 --> 14:57.300
CAME FROM.

14:57.300 --> 14:57.834
ONE REASON MAY BE THAT IT

14:57.834 --> 14:58.967
ORIGINATED WITH THIS

14:58.967 --> 15:00.000
GANG OF COYOTES THAT HAS MADE

15:00.000 --> 15:03.233
BILLIONS SELLING HUMAN BABIES TO

15:03.233 --> 15:05.300
OTHER HUNGRIER COYOTES."

15:05.300 --> 15:06.533
AND LOOK, IF THE OPINIONS WERE

15:06.533 --> 15:08.533
CONFINED JUST TO THE COMMENTARY

15:08.533 --> 15:10.133
OR TO THE AD BREAKS, THAT WOULD

15:10.133 --> 15:11.300
BE ONE THING.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.200
BUT SINCLAIR CAN SOMETIMES

15:12.200 --> 15:14.133
DICTATE THE CONTENT OF YOUR

15:14.133 --> 15:15.967
LOCAL NEWSCAST AS WELL.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.200
AND IN CONTRAST TO FOX NEWS,

15:17.200 --> 15:18.967
A CLEARLY CONSERVATIVE OUTLET

15:18.967 --> 15:21.700
WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

15:21.700 --> 15:24.266
GETTING, WITH SINCLAIR, THEY'RE

15:24.266 --> 15:25.100
INJECTING FOX-WORTHY CONTENT

15:25.100 --> 15:26.433
INTO THE MOUTHS OF THE LOCAL

15:26.433 --> 15:28.133
NEWS ANCHORS,

15:28.133 --> 15:29.300
TWO PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW AND WHO

15:29.300 --> 15:31.000
YOU TRUST AND WHOSE ON-SCREEN

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
CHEMISTRY CAN USUALLY BEST BE

15:33.000 --> 15:36.433
DESCRIBED AS "TWO PEOPLE."

15:36.433 --> 15:37.066
AND YOU MAY NOT REALIZE

15:37.066 --> 15:38.700
IT'S HAPPENING.

15:38.700 --> 15:39.700
BECAUSE SINCLAIR, AND ITS

15:39.700 --> 15:41.300
"DIGITAL NEWS" SUBSIDIARY

15:41.300 --> 15:42.500
CIRCA NOT ONLY PRODUCE AND SEND

15:42.500 --> 15:44.433
PACKAGES TO THEIR STATIONS, THEY

15:44.433 --> 15:46.300
EVEN WRITE SCRIPTS LOCAL ANCHORS

15:46.300 --> 15:47.867
CAN USE TO INTRODUCE THEIR

15:47.867 --> 15:48.667
PIECES.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.667
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS TUESDAY NIGHT,

15:50.667 --> 15:52.100
ANCHORS AT SINCLAIR STATIONS ALL

15:52.100 --> 15:54.000
OVER THE COUNTRY INTRODUCED A

15:54.000 --> 15:55.734
STORY ABOUT MICHAEL FLYNN LIKE

15:55.734 --> 15:56.967
THIS.

15:56.967 --> 15:58.700
>> DID THE FBI HAVE A PERSONAL

15:58.700 --> 16:00.967
VENDETTA IN PERSUING THE RUSSIA

16:00.967 --> 16:02.967
INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT

16:02.967 --> 16:04.200
TRUMP'S FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY

16:04.200 --> 16:07.033
ADVISER MICHAEL FLYNN?

16:07.033 --> 16:17.700
>> DID THE FBI HAVE A PERSONAL

16:17.700 --> 16:18.667
VENDETTA IN PURSUING THE RUSSIA

16:18.667 --> 16:19.400
INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT

16:19.400 --> 16:20.066
TRUMP'S FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY

16:20.066 --> 16:21.333
ADVISER MICHAEL FLYNN?

16:21.333 --> 16:22.033
>> DID THE FBI HAVE A PERSONAL

16:22.033 --> 16:22.667
VENDETTA IN PERSUING THE RUSSIA

16:22.667 --> 16:24.467
INVESTIGATION

16:24.467 --> 16:25.166
INTO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER

16:25.166 --> 16:26.567
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

16:26.567 --> 16:27.400
MICHAEL FLYNN?

16:27.400 --> 16:28.033
>> DID THE FBI HAVE A PERSONAL

16:28.033 --> 16:28.533
VENDETTA IN PURSUING THE

16:28.533 --> 16:28.867
INVESTIGATION?

16:28.867 --> 16:29.633
>> IT COULD VERY WELL BE TRUE.

16:29.633 --> 16:30.333
>> John: YEAH, BUT YOU COULD SAY

16:30.333 --> 16:31.433
"IT COULD VERY WELL BE TRUE"

16:31.433 --> 16:32.767
ABOUT ANYTHING.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.300
ARE ALL PEANUT M&M'S JUST SNAKE

16:34.300 --> 16:36.100
EGGS PAINTED DIFFERENT COLORS?

16:36.100 --> 16:37.266
DO FOXES WALK ON THEIR HIND LEGS

16:37.266 --> 16:39.900
WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING?

16:39.900 --> 16:40.734
IS THERE REALLY ONLY ONE OLSEN

16:40.734 --> 16:42.734
TWIN WHO'S MOVING BACK AND FORTH

16:42.734 --> 16:43.800
AT SUPERHUMAN SPEED TO TRICK THE

16:43.800 --> 16:44.900
HUMAN EYE INTO SEEING TWO OF

16:44.900 --> 16:46.400
THEM?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.300
ALL OF THOSE THINGS COULD VERY

16:48.300 --> 16:49.800
WELL BE TRUE, AND, ASIDE FROM

16:49.800 --> 16:50.867
THAT ONE ABOUT THE OLSEN TWINS,

16:50.867 --> 16:54.200
NONE OF THEM ARE.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.934
NOW, THE STORY THEY WERE TEASING

16:55.934 --> 16:56.700
WAS THAT MICHAEL FLYNN HAD

16:56.700 --> 16:59.433
APPARENTLY SPOKEN UP ON BEHALF

16:59.433 --> 17:00.300
OF A FORMER FBI AGENT

17:00.300 --> 17:01.000
IN A GENDER-DISCRIMINATION SUIT

17:01.000 --> 17:03.300
AGAINST THE AGENCY.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.166
BUT IT'S A HUGE STRETCH TO GET

17:05.166 --> 17:06.867
FROM THERE TO AN AGENCY-WIDE

17:06.867 --> 17:13.533
CONSPIRACY TO BRING HIM DOWN.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.433
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S SOME REAL

17:15.433 --> 17:16.100
POWER IN HEARING YOUR TRUSTED

17:16.100 --> 17:17.066
LOCAL NEWSCASTERS USE FBI AND

17:17.066 --> 17:17.834
PERSONAL VENDETTA IN A SENTENCE.

17:17.834 --> 17:18.667
IF THOSE SAME NEWSCASTERS

17:18.667 --> 17:20.400
SOMEHOW USED THE WORDS

17:20.400 --> 17:22.467
"DANIEL STERN" AND "EXPLOSIVE

17:22.467 --> 17:23.667
EJACULATION" IN THE SAME

17:23.667 --> 17:25.433
SENTENCE, YOU COULD NEVER WATCH

17:25.433 --> 17:28.567
"HOME ALONE" THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.100
AND SINCLAIR'S CONTENT

17:30.100 --> 17:31.967
CAN OFTEN NOT BE OPTIONAL.

17:31.967 --> 17:32.800
THEY REGULARLY SEND OUT

17:32.800 --> 17:34.734
WHAT ARE CALLED "MUST-RUNS,"

17:34.734 --> 17:36.467
SEGMENTS THAT STATION MANAGERS

17:36.467 --> 17:37.567
ARE DIRECTED TO WORK INTO THEIR

17:37.567 --> 17:39.800
BROADCASTS.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.033
BOTH BORIS EPSHTEYN AND MARK

17:41.033 --> 17:43.667
HYMAN'S SEGMENTS ARE MUST-RUNS.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.233
AND SO ARE SOME "NEWS" SEGMENTS.

17:45.233 --> 17:47.834
IN FACT, LET ME GIVE YOU A TASTE

17:47.834 --> 17:49.166
OF A "MUST-RUN" STORY THAT RAN

17:49.166 --> 17:49.934
A MONTH BEFORE LAST YEAR'S

17:49.934 --> 17:52.300
ELECTION.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.400
>> HOW CAN AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY

17:54.400 --> 17:56.100
BLACKS AND LATINOS IN AMERICA,

17:56.100 --> 17:58.166
SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON?

17:58.166 --> 17:59.033
>> IT'S A SURPRISING MESSAGE

17:59.033 --> 18:00.967
COMING FROM A BLACK PASTOR, BUT

18:00.967 --> 18:03.033
EVANGELICAL BISHOP AUBREY SHINES

18:03.033 --> 18:03.967
IS SPREADING A MESSAGE OF WHY HE

18:03.967 --> 18:06.433
BELIEVES HILLARY CLINTON'S

18:06.433 --> 18:07.700
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ISN'T GOOD

18:07.700 --> 18:11.800
FOR BLACK AMERICANS.

18:11.800 --> 18:12.834
>> THE PARTY THAT GAVE THIS

18:12.834 --> 18:13.700
COUNTRY SLAVERY, THE KKK, JIM

18:13.700 --> 18:18.934
CROW LAWS.

18:18.934 --> 18:19.834
>> John: WHOA, HOLD ON.

18:19.834 --> 18:20.567
FIRST, DEMOCRATS GAVE THIS

18:20.567 --> 18:21.834
COUNTRY SLAVERY?

18:21.834 --> 18:22.767
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED

18:22.767 --> 18:24.633
THAN THAT.

18:24.633 --> 18:25.367
SURE, SOMEONE GAVE ME

18:25.367 --> 18:27.333
THIS HAIRCUT.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.467
BUT I'M ACCOUNTABLE FOR BEING

18:28.467 --> 18:30.667
COMFORTABLE WITH IT, LIKING IT,

18:30.667 --> 18:31.734
AND KEEPING IT AROUND FOR A

18:31.734 --> 18:32.433
MORALLY REPUGNANT AMOUNT OF

18:32.433 --> 18:34.567
TIME.

18:34.567 --> 18:37.834
AND YOU CAN MAYBE, MAYBE SEE WHY

18:37.834 --> 18:40.233
THAT COULD BE NEWS IN FLORIDA.

18:40.233 --> 18:41.433
"TAMPA PASTOR MAKES

18:41.433 --> 18:42.700
CRAZY VIDEO."

18:42.700 --> 18:45.500
BUT THAT PIECE RAN IN COLUMBUS,

18:45.500 --> 18:46.400
EL PASO, OMAHA, SYRACUSE,

18:46.400 --> 18:47.567
SEATTLE, GREEN BAY,

18:47.567 --> 18:48.567
TULSA, AND STATIONS ALL OVER THE

18:48.567 --> 18:51.433
COUNTRY.

18:51.433 --> 18:54.934
TO BE FAIR, SINCLAIR DIDN'T LET

18:54.934 --> 18:55.533
ALL THAT PASTOR'S ASSERTIONS

18:55.533 --> 18:56.133
GO COMPLETELY UNCHECKED.

18:56.133 --> 18:58.200
THEY DID HAVE THE BRIEF

18:58.200 --> 18:58.934
APPEARANCE OF BALANCE,

18:58.934 --> 18:59.333
BY BRINGING IN

18:59.333 --> 19:00.433
THIS POLITICAL SCIENTIST TO

19:00.433 --> 19:01.633
FACT-CHECK THE VIDEO.

19:01.633 --> 19:02.934
BUT HE WAS GIVEN FAR LESS SCREEN

19:02.934 --> 19:04.066
TIME THAN THE PASTOR, AND THE

19:04.066 --> 19:04.867
VOICEOVER UNDERCUT HIM AT EVERY

19:04.867 --> 19:07.033
TURN.

19:07.033 --> 19:08.133
>> BULLOCK SAYS THAT SHINES

19:08.133 --> 19:09.834
CHERRY-PICKED HIS HISTORY.

19:09.834 --> 19:10.700
>> BUT IF YOU HAVE THE WHOLE

19:10.700 --> 19:12.633
CONTEXT OF HISTORY AND WHERE

19:12.633 --> 19:14.600
THESE -- THE THINGS ARE

19:14.600 --> 19:15.433
MENTIONED WHERE THEY ACTUALLY

19:15.433 --> 19:17.467
MISS PIECES, THEN YOU WOULD NOT

19:17.467 --> 19:19.166
BE PERSUADED AT ALL.

19:19.166 --> 19:20.600
>> SO ABOUT THAT HISTORY?

19:20.600 --> 19:22.367
WHEN IT COMES TO THE KKK,

19:22.367 --> 19:23.800
HISTORIANS GENERALLY AGREE IT

19:23.800 --> 19:25.700
WAS CREATED IN POST-CIVIL WAR

19:25.700 --> 19:26.767
RECONSTRUCTION BY DEMOCRATS AND

19:26.767 --> 19:28.500
LATER, SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS WERE

19:28.500 --> 19:30.667
BEHIND THE JIM CROW LAWS.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.367
>> YES, THAT WAS THE PARTY OF

19:32.367 --> 19:33.300
THE SOUTH, AND AS I'VE

19:33.300 --> 19:34.934
MENTIONED, OVER TIME, THOSE

19:34.934 --> 19:37.333
PARTIES HAVE ACTUALLY SHIFTED IN

19:37.333 --> 19:38.200
TERMS OF WHAT THEIR MEMBERSHIP

19:38.200 --> 19:40.266
BASE IS.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.533
>> John: I LOVE HIS FRUSTRATION

19:41.533 --> 19:43.533
AS HE TRIES TO EXPLAIN THAT NOW

19:43.533 --> 19:45.900
IS NOT 100 YEARS AGO.

19:45.900 --> 19:46.667
YOU EXPECT HIM TO SAY,

19:46.667 --> 19:47.633
"I'LL PROVE IT.

19:47.633 --> 19:50.800
NEITHER OF US ARE WEARING BOWLER

19:50.800 --> 19:52.400
HATS, AND THAT WOMAN HAS A JOB!"

19:52.400 --> 19:53.734
ALL OF WHICH SUPPORTS MY THEORY

19:53.734 --> 19:57.700
THAT, AS I'VE MENTIONED, NOW IS

19:57.700 --> 19:59.000
NOT 100 YEARS AGO.

19:59.000 --> 19:59.834
AND HERE'S THE THING.

19:59.834 --> 20:00.367
THE MUST-RUNS ARE NOT JUST

20:00.367 --> 20:01.900
INDIVIDUAL PIECES.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.967
THEY'RE ALSO RECURRING FEATURES,

20:03.967 --> 20:05.333
LIKE POLL QUESTIONS, WHICH CAN

20:05.333 --> 20:07.233
RANGE FROM BENIGN TO PRETTY

20:07.233 --> 20:08.667
LEADING.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.900
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF TODAY'S

20:09.900 --> 20:11.333
COMEY TESTIMONY?

20:11.333 --> 20:12.333
DO YOU THINK IT WAS ALL ABOUT

20:12.333 --> 20:13.867
SUBSTANCE OR THEATER?

20:13.867 --> 20:15.166
DO YOU THINK ENOUGH IS BEING

20:15.166 --> 20:16.900
DONE TO BATTLE STREET GANGS IN

20:16.900 --> 20:17.834
THE U.S.?

20:17.834 --> 20:19.266
DO YOU TRUST INFORMATION FROM

20:19.266 --> 20:21.200
UNNAMED SOURCES IN THE

20:21.200 --> 20:22.200
WASHINGTON POST STORIES?

20:22.200 --> 20:24.000
WHY ARE CABLE NEWS CHANNELS

20:24.000 --> 20:26.100
AIRING SO MUCH COVERAGE OF THE

20:26.100 --> 20:27.934
TRUMP/RUSSIA STORY?

20:27.934 --> 20:29.567
SO HERE ARE THE OPTIONS:

20:29.567 --> 20:31.800
IT'S BIAS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT,

20:31.800 --> 20:33.166
FOR HIGHER RATINGS,

20:33.166 --> 20:34.066
OR IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

20:34.066 --> 20:37.367
STORY?

20:37.367 --> 20:39.934
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A CLEAR

20:39.934 --> 20:40.600
SLANT TO THOSE QUESTIONS

20:40.600 --> 20:41.467
AND ANSWERS.

20:41.467 --> 20:42.133
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE INEVITABLE

20:42.133 --> 20:45.633
POLL: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE

20:45.633 --> 20:46.567
WAY DONALD TRUMP LOOKS

20:46.567 --> 20:47.200
IN ATHLETICWEAR?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.000
A, ADONIS-LIKE.

20:48.000 --> 20:48.900
B, HERCULEAN.

20:48.900 --> 20:49.767
C, STRIKING FOR A MAN

20:49.767 --> 20:51.100
OF HIS AGE.

20:51.100 --> 20:51.967
OR D, NOT MY THING

20:51.967 --> 20:56.066
BUT I'D STILL HIT IT.

20:56.066 --> 21:00.066
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST TROUBLING

21:00.066 --> 21:02.300
THING OF ALL IS THAT SINCLAIR

21:02.300 --> 21:04.400
HAS A DAILY MUST-RUN SEGMENT

21:04.400 --> 21:05.100
CALLED THE TERRORISM ALERT DESK.

21:05.100 --> 21:05.567
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:05.567 --> 21:06.133
THEY REPORT ON TERRORISM

21:06.133 --> 21:07.233
EVERY SINGLE DAY,

21:07.233 --> 21:08.133
WHETHER THERE'S SOMETHING MAJOR

21:08.133 --> 21:09.934
TO REPORT ON OR NOT.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.033
WHICH MEANS THAT SOMETIMES,

21:11.033 --> 21:11.967
THE UPDATES CONTAIN THINGS LIKE

21:11.967 --> 21:17.467
THIS.

21:17.467 --> 21:20.233
>> THE COMPANY IN CHARGE OF

21:20.233 --> 21:22.066
SECURITY SAYS THE RINGLEADER OF

21:22.066 --> 21:24.066
THE LONDON BRIDGE ATTACK DID

21:24.066 --> 21:25.600
APPLY FOR A JOB.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.300
HE WAS NOT INTERVIEWED AND NO

21:27.300 --> 21:28.633
INTERVIEW WAS SCHEDULED.

21:28.633 --> 21:31.400
HE FILLED OUT AN ONLINE

21:31.400 --> 21:32.400
APPLICATION.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.066
>> AN ISIS FLAG WAS FOUND

21:33.066 --> 21:33.734
HANGING IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN NEW

21:33.734 --> 21:34.200
HAMPSHIRE.

21:34.200 --> 21:34.867
IT WAS TAKEN DOWN AND POLICE ARE

21:34.867 --> 21:35.500
LOOKING INTO WHO PUT IT THERE.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.233
FROM THE TERRORISM ALERT DESK

21:36.233 --> 21:37.000
IN WASHINGTON,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I'M LINDSAY MASTIS.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.333
>> John: IN OTHER ALERTS:

21:39.333 --> 21:41.233
MY GRANDMA HEARD A LOUD NOISE,

21:41.233 --> 21:42.467
A MAN WITH A BEARD ASKED ME

21:42.467 --> 21:43.166
WHEN THE NEXT BUS IS COMING,

21:43.166 --> 21:45.700
AND IRAN STILL EXISTS.

21:45.700 --> 21:46.767
FROM THE TERRORISM ALERT DESK

21:46.767 --> 21:48.333
IN WASHINGTON, I'M JUST ABOUT

21:48.333 --> 21:51.000
DONE WITH THIS.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.233
AND LOOK, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT

21:52.233 --> 21:54.467
THE TERROR ALERT DESK HAS ALSO

21:54.467 --> 21:55.600
FEATURED SOME TRULY TERRIFYING

21:55.600 --> 22:01.233
STORIES.

22:01.233 --> 22:04.133
>> ISIS HAS CARRIED OUT A

22:04.133 --> 22:06.133
GRUESOME PUBLIC EXECUTION IN

22:06.133 --> 22:07.100
IRAQ.

22:07.100 --> 22:07.700
THEY SLICED 9 TEENS IN HALF

22:07.700 --> 22:08.200
WITH A CHAINSAW.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.033
>> John: NOW, THAT CAUGHT OUR

22:09.033 --> 22:09.667
ATTENTION BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE

22:09.667 --> 22:10.300
THE SORT OF THING WE'D HAVE SEEN

22:10.300 --> 22:10.800
REPORTED ELSEWHERE.

22:10.800 --> 22:11.600
SO WE TRIED TO TRACK DOWN THAT

22:11.600 --> 22:12.633
STORY, AND IT ORIGINATED WITH AN

22:12.633 --> 22:14.266
ANONYMOUSLY SOURCED REPORT

22:14.266 --> 22:15.333
ON SOMETHING CALLED

22:15.333 --> 22:16.767
IRAQINEWS.

22:16.767 --> 22:17.600
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND ANY

22:17.600 --> 22:19.333
OUTLET THAT HAD INDEPENDENTLY

22:19.333 --> 22:20.400
VERIFIED IT, AND EVEN WHEN IT

22:20.400 --> 22:21.333
WAS PICKED UP BY

22:21.333 --> 22:23.166
BRITISH TABLOIDS AND BREITBART,

22:23.166 --> 22:24.133
THEY WERE CAREFUL TO DISTANCE

22:24.133 --> 22:25.834
THEMSELVES WITH LANGUAGE LIKE

22:25.834 --> 22:27.066
"IT HAS BEEN CLAIMED"

22:27.066 --> 22:28.633
AND "REPORTEDLY."

22:28.633 --> 22:30.700
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS

22:30.700 --> 22:31.900
POSSIBLE TO DIP BENEATH

22:31.900 --> 22:32.834
THE JOURNALISTIC STANDARDS OF

22:32.834 --> 22:35.700
BREITBART.

22:35.700 --> 22:36.834
THAT'S LIKE BEING TOO BAD A CHEF

22:36.834 --> 22:37.533
TO WORK AT A

22:37.533 --> 22:39.633
CARNIVAL FOOD CART.

22:39.633 --> 22:40.834
"LOOK, YOUR FRIED HAM

22:40.834 --> 22:42.734
IS UNIMAGINATIVE AND BLAND.

22:42.734 --> 22:44.934
AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

22:44.934 --> 22:45.633
WE'RE UNCLE STICKY'S DISCOUNT

22:45.633 --> 22:53.066
HAM WAGON."

22:53.066 --> 22:55.567
THEY REPORTED IT LIKE IT WAS A

22:55.567 --> 22:56.467
FACT.

22:56.467 --> 22:57.066
BUT WHAT WAS PERHAPS EVEN

22:57.066 --> 22:57.633
WEIRDER ABOUT THAT CHAINSAW

22:57.633 --> 22:58.166
SEGMENT WAS THE STORY THAT

22:58.166 --> 22:58.633
CLOSED IT OUT.

22:58.633 --> 22:59.367
>> AND MAYORS IN 22 FRENCH TOWNS

22:59.367 --> 23:00.100
ARE IGNORING A HIGH COURT'S

23:00.100 --> 23:02.533
RULING BANNING BURKINIS IS

23:02.533 --> 23:03.767
ILLEGAL.

23:03.767 --> 23:05.100
MORE THAN 30 TOWNS INITIALLY

23:05.100 --> 23:07.333
OUTLAWED THE SWIMWEAR WORN

23:07.333 --> 23:09.300
MOSTLY BY MUSLIM WOMEN.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.433
FROM THE TERRORISM ALERT DESK,

23:10.433 --> 23:13.166
I'M MICHELLE MARSH.

23:13.166 --> 23:14.934
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK?

23:14.934 --> 23:16.300
THAT'S NOT ABOUT TERRORISM.

23:16.300 --> 23:19.100
IT'S JUST ABOUT MUSLIMS.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.767
BY THAT DEFINITION, TERRORISM

23:20.767 --> 23:23.500
IS "ANYTHING A MUSLIM DOES."

23:23.500 --> 23:24.200
TONIGHT: MAHERSHALA ALI

23:24.200 --> 23:26.000
ON THE COVER OF "GQ,"

23:26.000 --> 23:26.700
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR

23:26.700 --> 23:28.400
SNEEZED IN AN AIRPORT,

23:28.400 --> 23:29.433
AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO

23:29.433 --> 23:30.900
FAREED ZAKARIA!

23:30.900 --> 23:32.133
THIS HAS BEEN YOUR TERRORISM

23:32.133 --> 23:35.467
ALERT DESK.

23:35.467 --> 23:37.133
NOW TO THEIR CREDIT, IN THE FACE

23:37.133 --> 23:38.734
OF ALL THIS, SOME SINCLAIR

23:38.734 --> 23:39.633
STATIONS ARE FIGHTING BACK

23:39.633 --> 23:41.800
AGAINST THEIR PARENT COMPANY.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.166
FOR INSTANCE, THEIR STATION

23:43.166 --> 23:44.500
IN SEATTLE, "COMO,"

23:44.500 --> 23:45.600
HAVE ENGAGED IN

23:45.600 --> 23:46.867
CLEVER ACTS OF REBELLION,

23:46.867 --> 23:48.767
LIKE AIRING MUST-RUNS AT TIMES

23:48.767 --> 23:50.567
OF LOW VIEWERSHIP.

23:50.567 --> 23:52.800
IN FACT, THEIR ONLY AIRING

23:52.800 --> 23:55.633
OF THE STORY ABOUT

23:55.633 --> 23:57.600
THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ISIS FLAG

23:57.600 --> 23:58.400
WAS AT 4:54 A.M.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.266
SO IT WAS BASICALLY ONLY SEEN BY

23:59.266 --> 24:00.400
PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL WAITING

24:00.400 --> 24:02.233
ROOMS, CUSTOMERS AT 24-HOUR

24:02.233 --> 24:06.967
SEVEN-ELEVENS, AND CRAIG.

24:06.967 --> 24:12.166
JUST GO TO BED!

24:12.166 --> 24:13.800
GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.934
GO TO BED!

24:14.934 --> 24:15.767
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IF YOU WORK AT

24:15.767 --> 24:16.400
A SINCLAIR STATION, THERE'S ONLY

24:16.400 --> 24:20.133
SO MUCH YOU CAN DO.

24:20.133 --> 24:20.633
AND SHOULD THIS TRIBUNE

24:20.633 --> 24:21.800
ACQUISITION GOES THROUGH, THERE

24:21.800 --> 24:22.600
ARE GOING TO BE EVEN MORE GOOD

24:22.600 --> 24:23.533
JOURNALISTS HAVING TO SEE THEIR

24:23.533 --> 24:24.433
HARD WORK PLACED ALONGSIDE

24:24.433 --> 24:26.066
TERROR-DESK NONSENSE.

24:26.066 --> 24:27.100
JUST AS THERE'LL BE EVEN MORE

24:27.100 --> 24:29.000
UNSUSPECTING AUDIENCE MEMBERS

24:29.000 --> 24:30.233
WHO'LL BE GETTING A HEAPING DOSE

24:30.233 --> 24:31.433
OF SINCLAIR'S CONTENT,

24:31.433 --> 24:33.266
POSSIBLY WITHOUT REALIZING IT.

24:33.266 --> 24:35.734
SO YOU SHOULD FIND OUT WHO OWNS

24:35.734 --> 24:36.667
YOUR LOCAL STATIONS, AND BEAR

24:36.667 --> 24:39.100
THAT IN MIND AS YOU WATCH.

24:39.100 --> 24:40.600
AND FOR ANY TRIBUNE STATION THAT

24:40.600 --> 24:42.667
COULD SOON BE TAKEN OVER, WE'VE

24:42.667 --> 24:44.367
PRODUCED A LITTLE VIDEO SO YOU

24:44.367 --> 24:45.533
CAN ALERT YOUR VIEWERS.

24:45.533 --> 24:46.567
DON'T THINK OF IT AS

24:46.567 --> 24:49.667
A "MUST RUN."

24:49.667 --> 24:50.767
THINK OF IT MORE AS

24:50.767 --> 24:51.266
A "PROBABLY SHOULD RUN."

24:51.266 --> 24:55.433
TAKE A LOOK.

24:55.433 --> 24:58.266
>> HELLO, I AM STEVE FROM

24:58.266 --> 24:59.800
"THE SOPRANOS" AND I AM PROBABLY

24:59.800 --> 25:01.867
NOT THE LAST GUY WITH AN ACCENT

25:01.867 --> 25:03.433
WEARING A CHEAP TIE STANDING IN

25:03.433 --> 25:04.066
FRONT OF A GREEN SCREEN THAT

25:04.066 --> 25:05.266
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ON THIS

25:05.266 --> 25:05.734
CHANNEL.

25:05.734 --> 25:07.867
I WILL TELL YOU WHY.

25:07.867 --> 25:11.867
THIS STATION COULD SOON BE OWNED

25:11.867 --> 25:13.934
BY SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP.

25:13.934 --> 25:16.867
YOU MIGHT SEE THIS FUCKING GUY

25:16.867 --> 25:18.867
WITH THIS FUCKING LOGO OR THIS

25:18.867 --> 25:19.633
FUCKING DESK.

25:19.633 --> 25:21.333
THAT WASN'T PRODUCED BY THE

25:21.333 --> 25:22.767
STATION BECAUSE THE PEOPLE AT

25:22.767 --> 25:26.834
THE STATION NO LOCAL NEWS SHOULD

25:26.834 --> 25:28.633
NEVER BE ABOUT CHEAP

25:28.633 --> 25:29.433
SCAREMONGERING OR ADVANCING THE

25:29.433 --> 25:30.367
POLITICAL AGENDA.

25:30.367 --> 25:33.567
IT SHOULD ONLY BE ABOUT WEATHER,

25:33.567 --> 25:35.934
SPORTS, INVESTIGATIONS, HUMAN

25:35.934 --> 25:38.333
INTEREST STORIES FEATURING CUTE

25:38.333 --> 25:41.300
ANIMALS LIKE THIS PIG.

25:41.300 --> 25:44.233
LOOK AT THIS LITTLE GUY.

25:44.233 --> 25:46.900
HE IS CALLED PORK CHOP.

25:46.900 --> 25:50.066
ANYWAY, I AM TELLING YOU IF THIS

25:50.066 --> 25:51.500
BECOMES A SINCLAIR STATION, GOOD

25:51.500 --> 25:58.100
LUCK WITH THAT SHIT.

25:58.100 --> 26:01.200
>> John: MOVING ON.

26:01.200 --> 26:01.934
BEFORE WE GO TONIGHT,

26:01.934 --> 26:02.567
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

26:02.567 --> 26:03.033
AMERICA'S PRESIDENTS:

26:03.033 --> 26:04.033
THE ONLY GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS

26:04.033 --> 26:04.734
WE KNOW FOR SURE, AT SOME POINT,

26:04.734 --> 26:06.667
MASTURBATED IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

26:06.667 --> 26:10.600
OH, YOU THINK McKINLEY DIDN'T?

26:10.600 --> 26:11.333
COME ON, GROW UP.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.233
HE'S DOING IT IN THAT PHOTO!

26:13.233 --> 26:13.967
LISTEN, WITH ALL THE HORRORS

26:13.967 --> 26:15.734
OF OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT,

26:15.734 --> 26:16.433
IT CAN SOMETIMES HELP TO GET

26:16.433 --> 26:18.300
SOME HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.133
TO LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE

26:19.133 --> 26:20.467
WHO PRECEDED HIM.

26:20.467 --> 26:21.934
ALTHOUGH, A FEW MONTHS AGO,

26:21.934 --> 26:23.500
ONE PLACE WHERE YOU MIGHT BE

26:23.500 --> 26:24.500
ABLE TO DO THAT WAS FORCED TO

26:24.500 --> 26:26.033
SAY GOOD-BYE.

26:26.033 --> 26:27.166
>> AFTER NEARLY 60 YEARS

26:27.166 --> 26:28.433
OF OPERATION, THE HALL OF

26:28.433 --> 26:29.734
PRESIDENTS AND FIRST LADIES WAX

26:29.734 --> 26:31.834
MUSEUM IN GETTYSBURG IS SHUTTING

26:31.834 --> 26:32.700
DOWN.

26:32.700 --> 26:33.367
>> EVEN THOUGH THE MUSEUM WILL

26:33.367 --> 26:34.533
BE NO MORE, YOU HAVE AN

26:34.533 --> 26:35.867
OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A PIECE OF

26:35.867 --> 26:38.166
AMERICAN HISTORY.

26:38.166 --> 26:40.433
>> IT'S SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T

26:40.433 --> 26:41.100
COME UP EVERY DAY IN AN AUCTION

26:41.100 --> 26:41.734
FOR SURE.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.734
>> SHOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING

26:42.734 --> 26:43.433
AUCTION AND WE HOPE LOTS OF

26:43.433 --> 26:45.300
PEOPLE COME.

26:45.300 --> 26:49.300
>> John: YEAH, SO DO I!

26:49.300 --> 26:51.967
I HOPE THAT TOO.

26:51.967 --> 26:52.533
BECAUSE THESE WAX PRESIDENTS

26:52.533 --> 26:54.700
DESERVE A GOOD HOME!

26:54.700 --> 26:55.600
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE

26:55.600 --> 26:56.166
BENJAMIN HARRISON HAVING TO

26:56.166 --> 26:56.934
MODEL CULOTTES AT FOREVER 21.

26:56.934 --> 26:57.533
AND HERE'S THE THING.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.567
PEOPLE DID COME.

26:58.567 --> 27:01.633
SOME APPARENTLY PAID THOUSANDS

27:01.633 --> 27:02.233
OF DOLLARS TO OWN

27:02.233 --> 27:02.967
A WAX PRESIDENT.

27:02.967 --> 27:03.700
AND IT LATER TURNED OUT THERE

27:03.700 --> 27:09.633
WERE SOME NOTABLE BUYERS AMONG

27:09.633 --> 27:11.166
THEM.

27:11.166 --> 27:11.800
>> WE GOT OUR VERY OWN

27:11.800 --> 27:12.900
LIFE-SIZE WAX PRESIDENT.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.300
THAT IS PRESIDENT EISENHOWER.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.033
>> John: IS IT?

27:16.033 --> 27:17.467
IS IT, THOUGH?

27:17.467 --> 27:18.033
BECAUSE TO ME, IT LOOKS LIKE

27:18.033 --> 27:19.133
YOU MAY'VE JUST BOUGHT A WAX

27:19.133 --> 27:20.266
SCULPTURE OF BILL O'REILLY

27:20.266 --> 27:20.867
COVERING HIS ERECTION

27:20.867 --> 27:24.934
WITH A MAGAZINE.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.467
BUT IT WASN'T JUST MADDOW.

27:26.467 --> 27:28.133
STEPHEN COLBERT GOT ONE TOO.

27:28.133 --> 27:31.400
>> AND NOW, LADIES

27:31.400 --> 27:35.767
AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE RISE

27:35.767 --> 27:37.133
FOR YOUR "LATE SHOW" PRESIDENT,

27:37.133 --> 27:42.800
ZACHARY TAYLOR.

27:42.800 --> 27:43.734
>> John: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,

27:43.734 --> 27:43.967
STEPHEN!

27:43.967 --> 27:44.600
ALTHOUGH IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT

27:44.600 --> 27:45.300
THAT ZACHARY TAYLOR DIED

27:45.300 --> 27:46.333
OF A STOMACH BUG 16 MONTHS

27:46.333 --> 27:48.567
INTO OFFICE.

27:48.567 --> 27:49.734
SO HE'S REALLY LESS

27:49.734 --> 27:50.700
OF A PRESIDENT AND MORE OF A GUY

27:50.700 --> 27:51.934
NAMED ZACH WHO SHIT HIS BRAINS

27:51.934 --> 27:53.467
OUT IN THE WEST WING MEN'S ROOM.

27:53.467 --> 27:54.867
COLBERT ACTUALLY WANTED

27:54.867 --> 27:57.400
MARTIN VAN BUREN,

27:57.400 --> 27:59.266
BUT UNBEKNOWNST

27:59.266 --> 28:00.767
TO HIM -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

28:00.767 --> 28:02.200
JON STEWART BOUGHT THAT.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.700
PRESUMABLY TO ADD TO HIS

28:03.700 --> 28:04.800
EVER-EXPANDING MANNEQUIN

28:04.800 --> 28:05.867
SEX DUNGEON.

28:05.867 --> 28:06.433
THAT'S THE ONLY RATIONAL

28:06.433 --> 28:08.734
EXPLANATION.

28:08.734 --> 28:10.333
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:

28:10.333 --> 28:11.934
SPENDING GOOD MONEY ON A POORLY

28:11.934 --> 28:13.500
MADE WAX FIGURE OF A FORMER

28:13.500 --> 28:14.600
PRESIDENT SOUNDS PRETTY STUPID,

28:14.600 --> 28:15.433
RIGHT?

28:15.433 --> 28:15.867
YEAH.

28:15.867 --> 28:17.367
YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:17.367 --> 28:23.033
THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO SAY:

28:23.033 --> 28:26.467
WE DIDN'T GO DOWN THERE AND BUY

28:26.467 --> 28:27.667
ONE OF THEM.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.133
WE BOUGHT FIVE OF THEM.

28:29.133 --> 28:29.734
WHY FIVE?

28:29.734 --> 28:31.433
BECAUSE WE'RE FIVE TIMES

28:31.433 --> 28:33.133
STUPIDER THAN ANY OTHER TV SHOW,

28:33.133 --> 28:34.500
THAT'S FUCKING WHY.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.533
AND THE REASON WE'VE BEEN

28:35.533 --> 28:36.767
SITTING ON THIS FOR SO LONG IS

28:36.767 --> 28:38.100
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN VERY BUSY,

28:38.100 --> 28:39.700
CONSTRUCTING A HOME FOR OUR

28:39.700 --> 28:41.367
HORRIFYING NEW FRIENDS.

28:41.367 --> 28:42.433
IN FACT, TONIGHT I'D LIKE

28:42.433 --> 28:43.600
TO PRESENT TO YOU THE "LAST WEEK

28:43.600 --> 28:45.667
TONIGHT" HALL OF DUBIOUSLY

28:45.667 --> 28:47.000
LIFELIKE WAX COMMANDERS

28:47.000 --> 28:50.800
IN CHIEF!

28:50.800 --> 28:52.400
THE GANG'S ALL HERE!

28:52.400 --> 28:55.400
FIRST, THERE'S RICHARD NIXON!

28:55.400 --> 28:57.633
HE COST US $1,900 AND HE LOOKS

28:57.633 --> 29:00.400
LIKE A STORE-BRAND MITT ROMNEY!

29:00.400 --> 29:01.233
NEXT, BILL CLINTON, OR,

29:01.233 --> 29:02.333
TO BE MORE ACCURATE,

29:02.333 --> 29:02.867
JOHN TRAVOLTA IN "PRIMARY

29:02.867 --> 29:05.900
COLORS" AS BILL CLINTON.

29:05.900 --> 29:07.800
THEN THERE'S JIMMY CARTER.

29:07.800 --> 29:08.934
LOOKING LIKE THE "BEFORE" PHOTO

29:08.934 --> 29:11.066
FOR A JAUNDICE MEDICATION!

29:11.066 --> 29:11.967
AND WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON!

29:11.967 --> 29:13.934
WHO DIED OF PNEUMONIA 31 DAYS

29:13.934 --> 29:17.166
INTO OFFICE AND THIS IS PROBABLY

29:17.166 --> 29:18.233
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE WHEN HE DID!

29:18.233 --> 29:22.100
AND LASTLY:

29:22.100 --> 29:22.900
THERE IS

29:22.900 --> 29:23.467
WARREN G. FUCKING HARDING!

29:23.467 --> 29:24.233
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:24.233 --> 29:27.333
THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE, BECAUSE

29:27.333 --> 29:27.967
WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HARDING

29:27.967 --> 29:28.467
ON THIS PROGRAM.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.166
HE WAS OUR NATION'S

29:29.166 --> 29:30.033
29TH PRESIDENT, AND HIS

29:30.033 --> 29:32.133
ADMINISTRATION WAS NEARLY

29:32.133 --> 29:32.967
BROUGHT DOWN BY THE TEAPOT DOME

29:32.967 --> 29:34.700
SCANDAL.

29:34.700 --> 29:35.934
BUT HE'S PERHAPS MOST FAMOUS FOR

29:35.934 --> 29:37.600
HIS SEXUAL EXPLOITS.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.567
>> AFTER WARREN HARDING DIED

29:40.567 --> 29:41.834
IN 1923, NAN BRITTON WROTE

29:41.834 --> 29:44.967
A BOOK CLAIMING SHE'D BEEN HIS

29:44.967 --> 29:46.834
MISTRESS, THEY'D MADE LOVE

29:46.834 --> 29:47.500
IN A WHITE HOUSE CLOSET,

29:47.500 --> 29:49.367
AND HE'D FATHERED HER DAUGHTER.

29:49.367 --> 29:50.467
>> John: OH, WARREN.

29:50.467 --> 29:51.734
KNOCKING UP YOUR FRIEND'S

29:51.734 --> 29:52.767
DAUGHTER IN A WHITE HOUSE

29:52.767 --> 29:54.233
FUCK-CUPBOARD?

29:54.233 --> 29:59.467
YOU WAXY LITTLE PERVERT.

29:59.467 --> 30:00.834
BUT THE FACT IS, HARDING HAS AN

30:00.834 --> 30:01.834
INCREDIBLE LIFE STORY.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.100
AND IT'S A SHAME SOMEONE HASN'T

30:03.100 --> 30:04.200
ALREADY MADE A MAJOR MOTION

30:04.200 --> 30:07.233
PICTURE OF IT.

30:07.233 --> 30:08.633
WHO WOULD DO IT?

30:08.633 --> 30:10.734
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMEONE

30:10.734 --> 30:11.300
WITH WAY TOO MUCH TIME

30:11.300 --> 30:11.734
ON THEIR HANDS,

30:11.734 --> 30:13.266
WAY TOO MANY RESOURCES,

30:13.266 --> 30:14.633
AND UNFETTERED ACCESS

30:14.633 --> 30:17.900
TO A LIFESIZE WAX REPLICA

30:17.900 --> 30:18.500
OF FORMER PRESIDENT

30:18.500 --> 30:19.367
WARREN G. HARDING.

30:19.367 --> 30:22.066
IF ONLY THAT PERSON EXISTED,

30:22.066 --> 30:23.333
THE MOVIE THEY'D MAKE MIGHT LOOK

30:23.333 --> 30:36.700
A LITTLE LIKE THIS:

30:36.700 --> 30:39.934
IT'S >> HE CAME FROM HUMBLE

30:39.934 --> 30:45.333
ROOTS TO RUMINATION.

30:45.333 --> 30:50.700
>> AS I LIVE AND BREATHE.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.066
LET'S SHOW THESE FANCY

30:52.066 --> 30:52.734

30:52.734 --> 31:00.867

31:01.533 --> 31:04.033
THE UNITED STATES.

31:04.033 --> 31:07.066
>> BEHIND THE PUBLIC FACE, LIVED

31:07.066 --> 31:09.133

THE 29TH PRESIDENT OF THESE

31:15.266 --> 31:16.300
UNITED STATES.

31:16.300 --> 31:21.166
AND TWO ARE VERY GOOD FORTUNE.

31:21.166 --> 31:26.500
[LAUGHTER]

31:26.500 --> 31:28.400
>> DRIVEN BY HIDDEN PASSIONS

31:28.400 --> 31:30.200
BEYOND HIS CONTROL AND BEYOND

31:30.200 --> 31:35.300
THE REALM OF VIRTUE.

31:35.300 --> 31:39.100
>> MR. HARDING, I DO BELIEVE YOU

31:39.100 --> 31:43.066
ARE FLIRTING WITH ME.

31:43.066 --> 31:45.400
>> CONSUMED BY A LOST THAT WOULD

31:45.400 --> 31:48.700
NOT WE CAN.

31:48.700 --> 31:56.300
>> TAKE ME.

31:59.200 --> 32:03.900
GRACE AND DIGNITY.

32:03.900 --> 32:04.900
>> MR. PRESIDENT.

>> DOOMED TO PAY THE PRICE OF

32:07.200 --> 32:07.633
POWER.

32:07.633 --> 32:10.367
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I MUST ASK YOU

32:32.900 --> 32:33.500
DEMAND ANYTHING.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.767
>> HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME THIS

32:35.767 --> 32:35.934

DON'T YOU TURN YOUR BACK ON ME,

WARREN.

32:45.467 --> 32:48.066

32:50.734 --> 32:51.667
