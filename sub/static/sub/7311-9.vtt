WEBVTT

00:00.993 --> 00:02.961
Previously on NCIS:

00:03.112 --> 00:04.321
Code name Domino.

00:04.460 --> 00:06.857
Langer was in possession of Domino
when Lee killed him.

00:06.917 --> 00:08.633
We're gonna steal it.
Nobody gets hurt.

00:10.384 --> 00:12.601
It was a trap.
There's a mole at NCIS.

00:12.661 --> 00:15.015
- You mean, Langer was not alone?
- Do you know who it is?

00:15.097 --> 00:16.641
- Langer!
- He wasn't part of it.

00:16.723 --> 00:18.501
- Who are they?!
- I don't know!

00:18.620 --> 00:20.766
This is Amanda.
She's my daughter.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.974
If I don't deliver what they want,
they will kill her.

00:25.113 --> 00:26.526
What am I supposed to do?

00:27.006 --> 00:28.937
Looks like we're working together.

00:46.873 --> 00:49.460
Hey, stop! Come back!

00:49.844 --> 00:50.844
Hey...

00:56.749 --> 00:57.749
Hey!

00:59.418 --> 01:00.493
All right.

01:41.899 --> 01:43.438
- Here you go.
- All right.

01:45.842 --> 01:46.909
Thanks.

01:47.235 --> 01:50.400
- You know what I hate?
- Women with discriminating taste?

01:50.769 --> 01:52.540
Coffee shops without restrooms.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.601
You're not actually drinking that,
are you? We're on a stakeout.

01:55.661 --> 01:57.572
I was up late last night.
I'm tired.

01:58.016 --> 02:00.114
- What?
- This is Probie 101 stuff.

02:00.194 --> 02:02.753
You don't actually drink.
I call it the Gibb-sip.

02:06.447 --> 02:07.566
- See that?
- Yeah.

02:07.626 --> 02:09.130
- Looks like I'm drinking?
- Yeah.

02:09.484 --> 02:10.857
Not actually drinking.

02:11.418 --> 02:12.493
And I've been...

02:13.315 --> 02:15.713
Come to think of it,
it always looks like Gibbs is drinking,

02:15.773 --> 02:18.576
- but he never has to take a...
- DiNozzo, change the subject.

02:19.045 --> 02:20.830
Gonna have to change more
than the subject

02:20.890 --> 02:22.958
if I don't get a bathroom break soon,
boss.

02:23.661 --> 02:24.661
Hold it.

02:25.655 --> 02:27.286
Lee's on your ten, DiNozzo.

02:28.868 --> 02:31.526
Got her on my crosshairs.
Finger on the trigger.

02:32.781 --> 02:35.423
Show some sympathy, Tony.
Her daughter's out there somewhere.

02:35.529 --> 02:38.114
She lied about killing two men,
lied about stealing secrets,

02:38.175 --> 02:41.498
how do we know she's not lying about
her daughter, who nobody's ever seen?

02:41.875 --> 02:44.203
The pickup man shows, she's not lying.

02:45.114 --> 02:47.047
Here you go. Coffee drip.

02:47.107 --> 02:48.434
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

02:57.501 --> 03:01.123
Either Lee is very anal,
or she's sending someone a signal.

03:01.957 --> 03:05.181
I smell a non-fat soy
double-cross latte.

03:21.755 --> 03:22.620
Here we go.

03:22.719 --> 03:25.744
Boss, we got a guy in a scarf,
sunglasses and a hat.

03:26.163 --> 03:28.332
That's him.
On his tail, DiNozzo.

03:29.049 --> 03:30.049
Got him.

03:34.018 --> 03:36.934
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

03:38.024 --> 03:40.136
- Lost visual. Get on him.
- I know. No.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.766
- Get out of my way.
- Sorry, sir.

03:41.826 --> 03:43.855
- I got him. Where is he?
- Parking structure.

03:43.915 --> 03:45.432
Just let me get that. I'm so...

03:52.595 --> 03:53.829
Boss, we lost him.

03:54.425 --> 03:56.972
- Lee, what the hell were you thinking?
- You were too close.

03:57.032 --> 03:59.520
- He could have made you.
- My show. My call.

03:59.623 --> 04:00.937
My car. Now.

04:02.464 --> 04:05.449
- Heard you had a little accident.
- Wasn't an accident.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.122
Any news about my daughter?

04:08.373 --> 04:10.896
NSA got a hit.
They're downloading the footage now.

04:11.005 --> 04:12.005
NSA?

04:12.293 --> 04:14.245
- Does Gibbs know?
- Know about what?

04:14.996 --> 04:16.488
Do they have something?

04:16.841 --> 04:18.089
We had something.

04:18.248 --> 04:21.288
The pickup man in perfect position
before you blew it with the brew.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.539
He knows my routine.

04:22.926 --> 04:24.556
I felt I may have been compromised.

04:24.751 --> 04:26.656
Look, I did my part. I made the drop.

04:26.983 --> 04:29.019
But I couldn't risk him seeing
anything unusual.

04:29.079 --> 04:30.852
- What do you know about him?
- Nothing.

04:30.912 --> 04:33.412
I only see him when
he's expecting a drop at the cafe.

04:33.492 --> 04:36.342
- Always the same guy?
- He hides his face. I try not to stare.

04:37.225 --> 04:38.706
- Yeah?
- Footage coming in.

04:38.819 --> 04:41.907
O.K. On our way.
McGee's ready for us in MTAC, boss.

04:41.967 --> 04:43.861
It's a restricted area.
You're not invited.

04:43.921 --> 04:46.609
No. She is invited.
We need confirmation.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.851
You got eyes on her, right?

05:02.150 --> 05:04.804
- What about this morning?
- Her rope got shorter.

05:05.012 --> 05:07.896
- Lucky she's not hanging by it.
- It's online now, Agent McGee.

05:08.359 --> 05:11.444
Working off what Abby gave us,
an NSA satellite came up

05:11.504 --> 05:15.006
with this thermal footage early this
morning over Hickory Grove, Virginia.

05:15.409 --> 05:16.858
Found unusual activity.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.519
We convinced NSA
to give us a look at photos

05:20.579 --> 05:22.649
from one of
their keyhole imaging satellites.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.958
This is 4:14:46 AM.

05:26.361 --> 05:28.212
No facial recognition on the man.

05:28.975 --> 05:30.039
He never looked up.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.963
We had better luck
with the girl, though.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.375
You recognize her?

05:34.975 --> 05:35.975
Amanda.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.903
Looks like Lee was telling the truth.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.634
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

05:51.441 --> 05:53.702
It is a little girl
being chased into a field.

05:53.775 --> 05:55.810
- Maybe that's the plan.
- What plan?

05:55.989 --> 05:56.989
Exactly.

05:57.413 --> 05:59.611
All right.
Coordinates are done programming.

05:59.770 --> 06:02.512
GPS will take you to the spot
where the girl was last seen.

06:02.572 --> 06:04.853
There's a built-in compass in there
so you don't get lost.

06:04.921 --> 06:06.132
Don't worry, McScout.

06:06.411 --> 06:08.039
We got our Mossad hunting dog.

06:08.154 --> 06:09.218
Bark once for yes.

06:10.981 --> 06:13.030
- I'm going with you.
- You're not going anywhere.

06:16.219 --> 06:16.852
Sit.

06:17.079 --> 06:18.436
- Sir?
- You still talking?

06:19.884 --> 06:21.068
Why are you still here?

06:22.156 --> 06:23.311
McGee, photos.

06:25.782 --> 06:27.789
Okay. Now, we can't see their...

06:30.824 --> 06:31.911
Sorry, boss.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.109
Can't see their faces,
but based on height and build relative

06:35.169 --> 06:38.536
to Agent Lee and the little girl, we
are looking at two very different guys.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.685
I only get text-message instructions
from one person.

06:41.745 --> 06:43.835
- It could be either one.
- Or neither one.

06:44.054 --> 06:45.944
Someone else
could be pulling the strings.

06:46.172 --> 06:47.591
Take her to the conference room.

06:47.671 --> 06:48.999
- And do what?
- Watch her.

06:49.059 --> 06:51.290
Shouldn't I at least take a laptop?
At least get an ID?

06:51.350 --> 06:54.055
Let Abby do that.
Your eyes are gonna be on her.

06:56.990 --> 06:59.356
- Are we looking for three people?
- Don't know.

07:00.452 --> 07:01.845
Someone's taken the bait.

07:03.437 --> 07:06.179
Thinks he's gotten away
with a sample of Domino

07:06.641 --> 07:09.064
that details how
our military will respond

07:09.124 --> 07:11.592
to an attack on
a communications link in Israel.

07:11.652 --> 07:12.805
And he'll test it.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.472
Then wait and see if
our response matches his info.

07:15.630 --> 07:19.153
It's the only way to prove to him
Lee has access to the complete Domino.

07:20.610 --> 07:22.933
SECNAV doesn't share your enthusiasm.

07:23.336 --> 07:26.361
Lee is the only way to get
to the top of that pyramid.

07:26.993 --> 07:28.445
And to get her daughter back.

07:30.045 --> 07:32.990
SECNAV wants the pickup man
picked up at the next opportunity.

07:33.071 --> 07:34.381
That's a bad idea.

07:34.468 --> 07:36.319
Maybe. But it's an order.

07:45.577 --> 07:48.264
Were you able to trace
any of the text messages from him?

07:52.181 --> 07:54.721
Because of the level of
SMS encryption he was using,

07:55.185 --> 07:56.528
along with the fact that he

07:56.588 --> 07:59.682
masked the signal by bouncing
it halfway around the world, no.

08:01.796 --> 08:03.906
Whoever this guy is,
he knows how to hide.

08:04.393 --> 08:06.508
Well, what about
the messages I sent him?

08:06.623 --> 08:07.658
Sorry.

08:10.695 --> 08:12.258
You have a sister, don't you, McGee?

08:14.944 --> 08:18.486
You once withheld evidence in
a murder investigation to protect her.

08:18.753 --> 08:20.185
She was eventually cleared.

08:20.246 --> 08:22.725
Yeah, but you didn't know that
at the time.

08:28.212 --> 08:29.705
You did what you had to do...

08:30.650 --> 08:32.620
to save someone close to you...

08:33.874 --> 08:35.640
because you were scared for her.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.559
I know I'm going to have to pay
for what I did.

08:41.755 --> 08:45.716
I'm just saying, don't judge me without
remembering who I was scared for.

08:56.010 --> 08:59.603
How can you work with somebody for
3 years and not know they have a kid?

08:59.721 --> 09:02.239
Just because you work with somebody
every day does not mean you know

09:02.263 --> 09:03.600
everything about them.

09:04.421 --> 09:07.693
Really? Then I shouldn't know about
that tattoo on the inside of your...

09:07.758 --> 09:11.027
I meant, I can understand someone
wanting to keep their personal

09:11.110 --> 09:13.919
and professional lives separate.
As should you.

09:14.352 --> 09:18.210
Did not end well when you fell in love
while you were undercover, did it?

09:20.671 --> 09:21.924
Thanks for the memory.

09:23.412 --> 09:26.317
Trail starts here,
continues off northwest.

09:27.082 --> 09:28.448
North by northwest.

09:29.067 --> 09:32.331
I'm talking about espionage,
"Judy, Judy, Judy".

09:32.728 --> 09:35.274
Cary Grant, Leo G. Carroll.
Sound familiar?

09:35.334 --> 09:36.342
Ready for a hike?

09:37.221 --> 09:38.256
Can't we drive?

09:42.240 --> 09:45.424
If we end up hanging off Lincoln's nose,
this is really gonna suck.

09:48.074 --> 09:49.129
How'd it go?

09:49.496 --> 09:52.199
That's an inappropriate question,
McGee. Tag! You're it.

09:53.540 --> 09:55.325
She wouldn't say a word to me
in there.

09:55.385 --> 09:57.610
She's usually
the sympathetic one, right?

09:57.715 --> 09:59.574
Abby has her own code.

09:59.827 --> 10:00.827
Stand here.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.838
- In the doorway?
- Yeah, in the doorway.

10:03.962 --> 10:05.935
- Any hits on the pickup man?
- Nothing yet.

10:06.096 --> 10:09.258
Like most things, it would go faster
if there were two people working on it.

10:09.334 --> 10:12.438
But since you're baby-sitting
the P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R...

10:13.200 --> 10:15.409
- I can spell, Abby.
- Really?

10:15.908 --> 10:18.535
Okay, how about T-R-U-S-T?

10:20.529 --> 10:21.529
Look,

10:22.220 --> 10:24.574
McGee told me you had
something to do with the satellites

10:24.634 --> 10:27.476
that helped find my daughter,
and I just wanted to thank you.

10:28.152 --> 10:29.286
How did you do it?

10:32.355 --> 10:34.713
I analyzed your daughter's hair
using the samples

10:34.822 --> 10:36.991
the blackmailer
sent as proof of life.

10:37.182 --> 10:41.182
As far as a person's diet goes,
hair is like a time machine.

10:41.405 --> 10:43.575
The longer the hair,
the further back we can travel.

10:43.703 --> 10:46.046
We can find out what
she's been eating, drinking,

10:46.108 --> 10:48.909
- the vitamins and nutrients.
- Is she healthy?

10:50.321 --> 10:52.065
Yeah. She is.

10:53.227 --> 10:55.254
Hair grows about
a half an inch a month.

10:55.375 --> 10:59.088
I cut a strand into equal sections,
and I analyzed each portion.

10:59.335 --> 11:02.041
After she was kidnapped,
your daughter's drinking habits changed.

11:02.114 --> 11:04.514
Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios,

11:04.593 --> 11:06.205
they vary by region.

11:06.641 --> 11:09.850
But since most water supplies
are tested by law, we could

11:09.989 --> 11:11.758
pinpoint a general location.

11:11.911 --> 11:14.578
The water she was drinking
was from eastern Prince William County.

11:14.798 --> 11:16.350
NSA kept an eye out for her.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.581
It's like a spot in the dark,
a hot spot.

11:18.693 --> 11:21.032
- Two, as it turned out.
- That was then.

11:22.809 --> 11:24.219
Yesterday's news, Gibbs.

11:24.358 --> 11:27.566
Just got to hop back in the DeLorean
and get back to today's problems.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.683
- Can I have McGee back, please?
- Tony needs me to call him.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.442
- Probably got lost.
- Yeah, go.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.144
Thank you, Abby.

11:37.372 --> 11:38.419
I mean it.

11:42.214 --> 11:44.164
Okay, listen.
So what I didn't tell her is,

11:44.268 --> 11:46.495
until we get the full DNA
test results back,

11:46.570 --> 11:49.157
we don't even know if
that hair belongs to her daughter.

11:52.417 --> 11:55.332
Define lost, McGee.
I know exactly where we are.

11:55.407 --> 11:58.506
We're between a tree and a bush.
Directly underneath the earth's sun.

11:58.806 --> 12:01.233
You're not showing up on the map.
Let me restart the scan.

12:01.478 --> 12:02.732
You might want to hurry.

12:03.018 --> 12:04.494
Ziva's turning in circles.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.045
Either the trail's gone cold
or she's about to mark her territory.

12:08.556 --> 12:10.120
Got it. Locating.

12:11.066 --> 12:13.730
Tony, you're about six miles
from where you started.

12:15.245 --> 12:17.335
Kid must have been scared out
of her mind.

12:18.742 --> 12:20.613
McGPS, are we close to anything?

12:21.869 --> 12:24.587
All right, Tony, there's a structure
on the other side of those woods.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.973
It's 200 yards northwest.
It's the only building around for miles.

12:28.329 --> 12:29.329
I got it.

12:30.998 --> 12:32.351
That way. 200 yards.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.920
Someone
has been coming here regularly.

12:51.713 --> 12:52.713
Clear.

12:56.116 --> 12:57.470
This is not right.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.945
Yeah, we're gonna have to walk
all the way back to the car.

12:59.982 --> 13:02.509
No. This room
is smaller than it should be.

13:08.803 --> 13:10.562
Did look bigger from the outside.

13:33.536 --> 13:34.536
Creepy.

13:36.592 --> 13:37.719
She has been moved.

13:40.810 --> 13:42.581
Looks like the help's been fired.

13:58.244 --> 14:00.715
Boss, we found something.
It's not good.

14:00.862 --> 14:02.483
- Yeah, go.
- The dead body.

14:02.571 --> 14:03.617
Our kidnapper.

14:04.948 --> 14:05.789
Full rigor.

14:05.849 --> 14:09.092
I'd say he was killed shortly after
we saw him grab the girl on satellite.

14:09.204 --> 14:11.533
Gunshot to the head.
Execution-style.

14:11.593 --> 14:14.643
- Should keep Ducky busy.
- No, he won't.

14:15.886 --> 14:17.458
- He won't?
- No.

14:17.765 --> 14:20.017
- We're not coming.
- Boss, this is a crime scene.

14:20.077 --> 14:22.719
Yeah, I know. Document everything.
Get the hell out of there.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.736
Whoever's behind this
could come back.

14:25.171 --> 14:26.171
Got it.

14:27.253 --> 14:28.973
All right.
Wrap it up, shutterbug.

14:29.126 --> 14:30.781
- We're bailing.
- We're leaving?

14:30.891 --> 14:32.229
Yeah. We are leaving.

14:32.311 --> 14:34.622
He is staying. Gibbs doesn't want
any lights, cameras action.

14:34.646 --> 14:36.503
In case the guy who shot him
comes back.

14:36.563 --> 14:37.563
Wait.

14:38.685 --> 14:41.371
No refrigerator. No food storage.

14:41.694 --> 14:43.235
He must have brought in supplies.

14:43.306 --> 14:46.541
The little girl realizes the routine.
She makes a run for it. He catches her.

14:46.658 --> 14:49.287
And when the boss hears
that she got away...

14:49.488 --> 14:52.260
He can't trust him or the safe house.
Kills the guy, moves the girl.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.722
- Speaking of moving, let's go.
- Here.

14:56.144 --> 14:57.538
Hairs from her hairbrush.

14:58.060 --> 15:01.013
- Were you able to lift any prints?
- I got the prints off the dead guy.

15:01.073 --> 15:02.898
The rest of the place is wiped clean.

15:03.724 --> 15:06.251
- What is this?
- Blood. Come on. Let's go.

15:06.497 --> 15:07.504
Ketchup.

15:16.265 --> 15:18.315
She was counting
the days with her lunch.

15:19.871 --> 15:20.918
Brave girl.

15:21.489 --> 15:24.693
Forensic evidence
requires some evidence.

15:26.243 --> 15:29.785
Of late I have had too many bodies
or none at all.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.735
I'm not here about a dead body.

15:32.156 --> 15:34.822
Yes, well, I hope you didn't come down
to ask for more patience.

15:34.883 --> 15:36.731
I am not a patient man.

15:37.380 --> 15:41.022
Which led me to realize
that our blackmailer is.

15:41.372 --> 15:43.795
- Patient.
- He's had the girl for eight months.

15:43.982 --> 15:46.176
He's also methodical, calculating,

15:46.550 --> 15:49.754
confident in his ability
to plan and execute.

15:49.945 --> 15:50.945
To wit.

15:53.637 --> 15:56.443
Everything from tank tops
to winter coats.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.148
From summer through winter
and back again.

15:59.452 --> 16:02.437
And even when Domino
was first compromised

16:02.506 --> 16:05.060
and Agent Langer was killed,
he didn't alter his plans.

16:05.127 --> 16:07.774
He merely extended his contingencies.

16:08.026 --> 16:10.779
So? Lee lays low for two months.

16:10.913 --> 16:14.664
Our blackmailer works slowly,
deliberately.

16:15.431 --> 16:16.431
And yet,

16:16.465 --> 16:19.614
he killed this man
and moved the girl within hours

16:19.729 --> 16:22.436
of her near-escape.
Fast and slow.

16:23.147 --> 16:24.520
The man is a contradiction.

16:24.972 --> 16:27.907
He only has compassion
when it suits him,

16:28.340 --> 16:30.126
cruelty when it's called for.

16:30.608 --> 16:33.235
I believe the poker term
is "grinder".

16:34.453 --> 16:35.690
Okay. Go on.

16:36.249 --> 16:38.630
Well, the only way to get at him is

16:38.690 --> 16:41.038
to make him believe
he has the winning hand.

16:41.711 --> 16:43.104
He needs to feel safe

16:43.199 --> 16:45.955
so that he can show all his cards.
Otherwise...

16:46.505 --> 16:49.132
- He folds.
- Goes back to waiting.

16:50.078 --> 16:51.159
What about the girl?

16:52.815 --> 16:54.059
Unfortunately,

16:54.119 --> 16:57.540
he no longer will see her
as his victim, but

16:57.677 --> 16:59.985
more as a witness to be disposed of.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.839
Did you find her?

17:10.349 --> 17:11.616
I'm here to relieve you.

17:11.964 --> 17:12.964
Thanks.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.535
Have fun.

17:18.106 --> 17:19.106
Sit down.

17:25.830 --> 17:27.943
No, we didn't find her.
Just where she's been held.

17:30.076 --> 17:31.768
Okay, what did you find exactly?

17:33.569 --> 17:35.241
He moved her.
That's all we know.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.553
And if he moved her,
it means she's alive.

17:38.876 --> 17:39.876
Anything else?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.772
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say anything.

17:45.989 --> 17:47.400
Had enough of your lies.

17:50.442 --> 17:52.491
This has never been about me.

17:52.918 --> 17:55.019
They had Amanda. I had no choice.

17:58.155 --> 17:59.725
This is for your drop tomorrow.

18:01.050 --> 18:02.104
Same routine?

18:02.164 --> 18:03.898
Except we're gonna grab
your pickup man.

18:04.015 --> 18:06.761
And this time you're not gonna
burn us or me with your coffee.

18:06.821 --> 18:09.139
You can't arrest him.
He could lead us to my daughter.

18:09.199 --> 18:10.582
We should be following him.

18:13.017 --> 18:14.977
Only person
I'm gonna be following is you.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.370
Home. Now. Get your things.

18:23.553 --> 18:24.627
Thank you, sir.

18:28.290 --> 18:29.604
Hi, what can I get you?

18:29.703 --> 18:31.699
- Large drip and a paper.
- No problem.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.763
- Your eighty-five.
- Thank you.

18:40.141 --> 18:41.412
Same routine.

18:42.004 --> 18:44.529
- I'm having a splash back.
- She must be nervous.

18:45.587 --> 18:47.148
You're so naive, McGullible.

18:47.362 --> 18:50.462
Tony, I spent the morning with her.
I think I gained a little insight.

18:51.905 --> 18:52.905
Really?

18:53.783 --> 18:55.454
Hey, let me get that for you.

18:56.151 --> 18:57.464
What are you doing?

18:57.694 --> 19:00.520
Removing the wool she's pulled
over your eyes.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.487
Got a little more.

19:03.849 --> 19:05.195
Hey, come-come on!

19:05.753 --> 19:07.768
I'm not saying I trust her.
Okay?

19:08.002 --> 19:09.813
I'm just saying I understand her.

19:10.143 --> 19:11.143
A little.

19:15.752 --> 19:18.319
Boss. Lipstick. Off routine.
She could be sending a signal.

19:18.404 --> 19:19.404
Hold.

19:21.602 --> 19:23.373
Hi, good. How are you?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.480
Who would be low enough
to kidnap a little girl?

19:31.540 --> 19:32.695
It's a good question.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.228
- Answer?
- My gosh.

19:34.408 --> 19:36.458
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, sir.

19:36.683 --> 19:39.890
It's just that you've never been
down here. Before. Alone.

19:40.043 --> 19:42.749
It's just weird.
I mean, not like kissing-your-brother

19:42.809 --> 19:46.292
weird, but more like new weird.
Like the first time you put your feet in.

19:46.368 --> 19:48.000
- Jell-O weird.
- What do you got?

19:49.330 --> 19:52.404
It's Abs. Gibbs calls me Abs.
"What do you got, Abs?"

19:52.913 --> 19:54.943
You're doing a Gibbs impression?

19:55.060 --> 19:57.158
No, I'm doing Vance.
What do you got, Abs?

19:57.320 --> 19:58.929
See, now that's better. It needs work.

19:59.012 --> 20:01.675
Like a little more swagger.
A little gravitas.

20:01.898 --> 20:04.835
But you still weren't doing
a Gibbs impression.

20:05.770 --> 20:06.785
Sciuto.

20:08.311 --> 20:09.537
Extra weird.

20:09.980 --> 20:10.980
Okay...

20:11.149 --> 20:14.363
I matched six points
on the dead man's fingerprints,

20:14.527 --> 20:15.766
but there's no data.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.258
There's no banking records,
no address, no credit history.

20:19.569 --> 20:21.417
The information's been deleted.

20:24.939 --> 20:26.889
- His identity's erased.
- A spy?

20:30.651 --> 20:31.487
What?

20:31.552 --> 20:32.895
It's the test results

20:32.955 --> 20:36.129
found on the hairs in the little girl's
bedroom/prison.

20:36.382 --> 20:38.740
Okay, most of them
match the little girl.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.889
But there's one different strand here.
Based on the amount

20:41.949 --> 20:45.156
of hair spray around the cortex,
I'd say it comes from an unknown female.

20:45.216 --> 20:46.579
Blackmailer is a woman?

20:47.754 --> 20:50.719
Well, women can be criminals, too.
Like Agent Lee.

20:55.511 --> 20:57.029
Heard about your techie mojo.

20:57.199 --> 20:59.489
Not that we talk about you
behind your back.

20:59.564 --> 21:00.698
Appreciate that.

21:01.729 --> 21:04.376
It's the final DNA analysis
of Lee's daughter's hair.

21:06.136 --> 21:07.136
Leon...

21:10.746 --> 21:12.059
Too soon for the Leon?

21:14.725 --> 21:15.725
Sorry.

21:16.303 --> 21:17.358
This is bad.

21:20.115 --> 21:22.587
Heads up. The invisible man is back.

21:33.201 --> 21:34.554
Something's wrong, boss.

21:34.896 --> 21:36.070
She's not leaving.

21:42.892 --> 21:44.872
- We got a problem.
- What?

21:45.183 --> 21:47.223
DNA came back
on the little girl's hair.

21:47.418 --> 21:49.049
She is not Lee's daughter.

21:49.547 --> 21:50.601
No relation.

21:51.309 --> 21:52.324
Lee's lying.

22:00.404 --> 22:02.344
- Tell me where my daughter is.
- Put it down.

22:02.428 --> 22:04.889
- Give me the paper.
- Drop it! Let go!

22:05.012 --> 22:07.340
Give me the paper!
No, you're screwing everything up!

22:07.415 --> 22:09.007
Now what if he's watching?

22:10.354 --> 22:12.509
- He'll kill her!
- Who, Amanda?

22:12.687 --> 22:13.687
My wife!

22:31.117 --> 22:32.465
Not your damn daughter.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.607
- DNA tests, they don't lie.
- She's my sister.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.733
I raised her from the time
she was six months old.

22:39.871 --> 22:41.665
I'm the only mother
she's ever known.

22:41.790 --> 22:42.801
Who is she?

22:43.572 --> 22:44.826
My parents adopted her.

22:45.648 --> 22:47.494
And when then they died, I promised

22:47.554 --> 22:49.800
that I would look after her,
protect her.

22:49.897 --> 22:51.549
By killing two innocent people?

22:51.867 --> 22:53.419
To save her life.

22:54.047 --> 22:57.767
Every night I went to bed
praying for this to be over.

22:57.847 --> 23:01.367
And every morning,
I wake up knowing that it wouldn't be.

23:02.317 --> 23:04.486
Don't tell me
you don't know what this is.

23:04.874 --> 23:07.325
Thought I'd care more
if she was your daughter?

23:07.996 --> 23:10.324
You wouldn't do what I did
to save your daughter's life?

23:12.582 --> 23:14.373
This time you tell the truth.

23:16.556 --> 23:18.904
You should have come to me
as soon as it happened!

23:22.476 --> 23:24.824
Before you murdered two men.

23:32.962 --> 23:34.303
Ted Bankston.

23:34.611 --> 23:36.180
Former NSA analyst.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.723
Yes.

23:37.804 --> 23:39.809
Says you left NSA 12 months ago,

23:40.875 --> 23:43.479
accused of mishandling
classified information.

23:44.443 --> 23:45.443
Yes.

23:47.357 --> 23:48.567
Did you?

23:48.683 --> 23:49.683
Yes.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.890
I stole information.

23:52.090 --> 23:55.658
When you lost your security clearance,
you need to find a new source.

23:55.848 --> 23:57.450
What? No.

23:57.532 --> 24:00.329
You hired this guy to grab the girl,
you blackmailed Lee.

24:01.019 --> 24:02.665
No, I've never seen him.

24:02.969 --> 24:03.999
Where's the girl?

24:04.373 --> 24:06.167
You're getting everything wrong!

24:06.249 --> 24:07.881
I don't have anybody.

24:07.941 --> 24:10.223
He has my wife,

24:10.420 --> 24:12.589
and if I don't deliver
the rest of Domino...

24:14.589 --> 24:15.589
he will kill her.

24:15.730 --> 24:17.346
How do you know he has your wife?

24:22.729 --> 24:23.811
He sends these

24:24.356 --> 24:27.023
in little envelopes.

24:31.089 --> 24:32.089
How long?

24:32.948 --> 24:34.088
Almost a year.

24:34.992 --> 24:37.203
I thought when I left the NSA,

24:37.485 --> 24:38.485
it would end.

24:38.753 --> 24:41.412
But now he uses me
as a drop man for Lee.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.958
I will tell you whatever
you want to know,

24:46.510 --> 24:49.015
go wherever you want me to go.

24:49.518 --> 24:52.476
Just tell me that
you won't let my wife die.

24:58.218 --> 25:00.431
What do you do with
the information Lee passes you?

25:00.544 --> 25:01.751
He texts me.

25:02.596 --> 25:04.851
Then he sends me different
places to make a drop.

25:04.933 --> 25:05.965
You ever seen him?

25:06.059 --> 25:07.646
No, not in person.

25:07.828 --> 25:09.081
But you've spoken to him?

25:09.188 --> 25:10.188
A few times.

25:10.935 --> 25:11.935
Via computer.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.436
He calls himself "The Weather Man".

25:16.103 --> 25:19.992
Like he can predict the future,
tomorrow's weather, you know?

25:20.257 --> 25:22.680
He wants to access Domino

25:23.300 --> 25:25.638
to predict US military responses,

25:26.370 --> 25:28.793
troop movements. Why?

25:30.085 --> 25:31.085
Money.

25:33.211 --> 25:35.341
A pipeline is targeted in Israel.

25:35.756 --> 25:38.844
The Pentagon moves the US Sixth Fleet
to the Middle East.

25:39.846 --> 25:41.221
World market

25:41.303 --> 25:42.307
flinches.

25:42.926 --> 25:45.982
The price of everything
changes right overnight.

25:46.599 --> 25:49.109
Oil, commodities, airlines,

25:49.169 --> 25:50.981
real estate, currency.

25:51.481 --> 25:53.191
Buys and sells stocks.

25:53.273 --> 25:55.778
And he makes millions every day

25:56.200 --> 25:58.791
simply by knowing one thing:

25:59.298 --> 26:02.017
What's going to happen tomorrow.

26:06.066 --> 26:09.841
And I don't know if my wife's
even going to be alive tomorrow.

26:14.210 --> 26:15.923
Boss, NSA report you requested.

26:16.263 --> 26:18.877
- Bankston?
- Back story checks out.

26:18.937 --> 26:21.428
Dates, reason he left the NSA,
everything.

26:22.293 --> 26:23.597
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- My office.

26:23.679 --> 26:25.099
On my way.

26:26.350 --> 26:27.702
What do you got, Abs?

26:30.837 --> 26:31.837
Okay.

26:31.999 --> 26:34.892
Hair on the left
is from the cabin in Virginia.

26:35.168 --> 26:37.275
Hair on the right
is from Bankston's wife.

26:37.529 --> 26:38.696
They match.

26:39.726 --> 26:41.490
Bankston's wife was kept there, too?

26:41.846 --> 26:43.242
Oh, it gets worse.

26:43.344 --> 26:47.221
Both hairs are missing a cellular
protein sheath that's called...

26:48.122 --> 26:49.671
No difference what it's called.

26:49.731 --> 26:51.791
What really matters
is that it's missing.

26:51.873 --> 26:52.873
Missing what?

26:53.095 --> 26:55.199
Well, hair and fingernail roots,

26:55.259 --> 26:57.658
they can show of decomposition,
just like a body.

26:57.718 --> 26:59.715
Proteins break down
and moisture is lost.

26:59.775 --> 27:02.595
- Things that will only happen...
- After death.

27:02.893 --> 27:05.347
Bankston's proof of life
was actually proof of death.

27:07.239 --> 27:08.976
His wife is already dead, Gibbs.

27:11.566 --> 27:13.918
Communications tower
was destroyed this morning...

27:14.158 --> 27:16.540
We've got the world
jumping through hoops.

27:17.651 --> 27:19.361
Blackmailer knows that Domino's real,

27:19.594 --> 27:21.291
least the part we gave him.

27:21.351 --> 27:22.351
So now what?

27:22.714 --> 27:24.366
Bankston's gonna tell him the truth.

27:24.508 --> 27:25.680
Lee's got him.

27:26.088 --> 27:29.736
He refuses to hand over the complete
Domino until he hands over the girl.

27:30.446 --> 27:31.446
It's risky.

27:32.849 --> 27:35.892
Oh, you haven't heard
the risky part yet, Leon.

27:36.835 --> 27:39.048
Going to need the real Domino.

27:40.427 --> 27:41.842
That's not gonna happen.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.720
He finds out it's a fake,
that girl dies.

27:47.815 --> 27:50.989
Paperwork authorizing use
of the real Domino.

27:51.049 --> 27:52.353
Needs your signature.

27:55.176 --> 27:57.358
We're not risking
our government's military playbook.

27:57.512 --> 27:59.610
You are authorized to use a decoy.

27:59.866 --> 28:00.866
That's it.

28:04.303 --> 28:05.303
Good luck.

28:15.793 --> 28:18.420
He should have contacted me by now.
What if he got spooked?

28:19.171 --> 28:20.506
And what about my wife?

28:22.729 --> 28:23.984
Domino's the bait.

28:24.278 --> 28:26.140
Girl's the ploy.
We're keeping it simple.

28:28.548 --> 28:29.548
That's him.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.938
Tell him Lee has Domino.

28:47.562 --> 28:48.826
She has a gun on him.

28:49.025 --> 28:51.672
Tell him he gets Domino
when she gets her girl.

28:56.892 --> 28:58.460
I'm just going to type what you say.

29:03.547 --> 29:04.758
- Deal?
- Deal.

29:07.467 --> 29:09.553
Tell McGee Adam's Tavern
is the dead drop.

29:09.613 --> 29:11.265
Unmarked units
patrolling a five-block

29:11.346 --> 29:13.558
radius around the bar,
additional agents on the inside.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.207
Evidence garage, five minutes.
You got him.

29:19.217 --> 29:20.873
- Do I get one of those?
- No.

29:22.281 --> 29:23.521
Sorry.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.197
Me, too.

29:26.898 --> 29:29.309
You've pled
your case with everyone else.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.760
Why not me?

29:30.854 --> 29:33.454
I'm done trying to explain.
No one understands.

29:34.698 --> 29:35.698
I do.

29:40.307 --> 29:41.545
You would do what I did?

29:46.701 --> 29:47.758
Is that too tight?

29:49.021 --> 29:50.021
It's fine.

29:51.338 --> 29:52.338
Thank you.

29:56.870 --> 29:59.540
I'm never going to see
my daughter again, am I?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.691
Probably not.

30:02.772 --> 30:04.984
Agent DiNozzo,
we're ready for audio check.

30:05.067 --> 30:06.779
Audio check, one, two, three.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.223
Agents at each exit.

30:09.283 --> 30:11.742
Nobody gets made.
This guy is going to be watching.

30:11.823 --> 30:13.143
Agent Gibbs.

30:13.497 --> 30:14.548
Yeah, I got it.

30:14.608 --> 30:16.488
- Go.
- All right, people, let's move out.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.830
You're going to need this.

30:20.449 --> 30:22.387
The Pentagon let you
have the real Domino?

30:28.077 --> 30:30.427
They just arrived at the rendezvous,
Director.

30:31.891 --> 30:32.891
Thank you.

30:37.463 --> 30:39.081
- Yes, Mr. Sec...
- Domino's been...

30:39.141 --> 30:40.141
When did...?

30:41.143 --> 30:43.841
It was downloaded from your office.
Special Agent...

30:43.901 --> 30:44.831
I assure you...

30:44.891 --> 30:46.651
An element of your plan
you opted not to...

30:46.711 --> 30:48.514
- Our plan is...
- Do I come down there

30:48.574 --> 30:50.901
and personally oversee
every decision that you make?!

30:50.961 --> 30:53.017
I'll deal with it immediately, Sir.

30:53.077 --> 30:54.077
Do that.

30:57.295 --> 30:59.539
- Something wrong, Director?
- SECNAV.

30:59.730 --> 31:03.001
Somebody hacked into
the Defense Intelligence computer,

31:03.082 --> 31:06.292
downloaded Domino, the real Domino.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.174
They traced it back
to your computer, McGee.

31:09.311 --> 31:13.011
You and Gibbs
have just committed treason.

31:47.431 --> 31:48.669
We're live, Boss.

31:49.058 --> 31:50.949
Look at him. Man's an artist.

31:52.512 --> 31:53.864
Fake stakeout drinking.

31:54.244 --> 31:55.620
Watch the Adam's apple move.

31:55.702 --> 31:57.789
Yet, no actual consumption.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.323
We've got a lot to learn, Ziva.

32:04.711 --> 32:06.658
Okay, I'll be right back
with your drinks.

32:15.827 --> 32:16.641
Yeah?

32:16.723 --> 32:19.184
- Shut it down.
- Well, it's a little late for that.

32:19.304 --> 32:22.564
I know you downloaded the real Domino.
Damn it. Shut it down!

32:24.071 --> 32:25.423
Hold on a second, Leon?

32:29.944 --> 32:32.028
I'm a little busy here.
Call you back.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.338
Okay, we're up.

32:50.632 --> 32:51.843
Ready to order?

32:54.411 --> 32:56.068
I said I'd call you back.

32:56.290 --> 32:58.224
- You did?
- What, Abs?

32:58.557 --> 33:00.268
- I figured it out, Gibbs.
- What?

33:00.349 --> 33:03.855
Our dead kidnapper's identity...
or, actually it's his non-identity.

33:03.978 --> 33:05.815
Very busy here, Abby.

33:05.981 --> 33:08.555
- Do you want to call me back?
- No, I want you to talk faster.

33:08.615 --> 33:09.819
Faster, okay.

33:09.941 --> 33:12.830
NSA finally returned my call, which is
good, because I was starting to think

33:12.854 --> 33:16.054
that their cooperation on the satellite
thing was just a one-night stand.

33:16.324 --> 33:18.804
And I wouldn't want NCIS to get
the reputation of being easy...

33:19.548 --> 33:22.562
Our dead kidnapper's real name
is Paul Winton,

33:22.622 --> 33:25.202
witness in an NSA/FBI
joint investigation,

33:25.262 --> 33:28.504
put into FBI witness protection.
New identity, new location.

33:28.586 --> 33:31.299
Lived in a safe house, which
is four blocks from where you are now.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.967
- Address.
- 1815 Longview.

33:34.048 --> 33:36.888
I ran the power records.
There's some massive juice use.

33:37.062 --> 33:38.916
Take a breath, Abs.
You've earned it.

33:40.561 --> 33:43.728
Ziva. FBI safe house,
1815 Longview.

33:43.810 --> 33:45.473
Take the agent from the south exit.

33:48.105 --> 33:49.105
You stay put.

33:59.624 --> 34:00.624
Boss, I'll go.

34:01.459 --> 34:02.459
Do it.

34:17.150 --> 34:18.980
DiNozzo, David...
where are they going?

34:19.094 --> 34:20.431
North, fast.

34:23.141 --> 34:25.018
- I want to talk to them.
- Already dialing.

34:28.293 --> 34:29.588
They're not answering.

34:36.079 --> 34:37.079
Clear.

34:40.406 --> 34:41.578
What the hell is this?

34:44.331 --> 34:45.331
Computers.

34:46.146 --> 34:47.380
I'm glad you're here.

35:21.151 --> 35:23.464
Hey, probie, what am I looking at?

35:23.524 --> 35:25.246
A career in the fast food industry.

35:25.327 --> 35:26.873
Director Vance, how are you, sir?

35:27.123 --> 35:29.501
It looks like
sequentially linked network racks.

35:29.816 --> 35:32.003
I'd say he's developed
his own Internet hub.

35:33.513 --> 35:35.256
That's how he covered
his stock purchases.

35:35.378 --> 35:38.634
Could make it look like 500 different
sellers when it was just one: Him.

35:38.716 --> 35:41.007
He's using an auto-response program.

35:41.261 --> 35:43.181
Doesn't have to be here
to send text messages.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.725
I have to call you back.

35:46.807 --> 35:47.807
DiNozzo...

36:00.783 --> 36:01.783
Still breathing.

36:03.331 --> 36:04.331
Sleeping pills.

36:09.654 --> 36:10.973
This is not good.

36:16.846 --> 36:18.011
Be careful, Tony.

36:18.460 --> 36:20.051
There's some kind of pressure plate.

36:20.269 --> 36:21.269
A bomb?

36:21.958 --> 36:23.366
Electrical circuit. Hardwired

36:24.803 --> 36:27.308
into the grid.
Powers the computers.

36:27.758 --> 36:29.018
She's part of the circuit.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.260
Cut the power?

36:30.435 --> 36:32.104
No, no, no. May cause a surge.

36:32.186 --> 36:35.275
Cooks the computers,
destroys the evidence

36:35.356 --> 36:36.356
and her.

36:36.474 --> 36:38.486
Backup plan in case
he didn't make it.

36:39.046 --> 36:42.030
She wakes up, shifts her weight off
the pressure plate.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.112
Same result.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.995
You ever seen Raiders of the Lost Ark?

36:48.882 --> 36:50.431
How much do you think she weighs?

36:51.798 --> 36:55.111
- How much does a gallon of water weigh?
- Eight pounds.

36:59.604 --> 37:01.122
Cover the exits.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.085
Shut down the alarm.

37:04.145 --> 37:05.407
Lock it down.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.270
Search everyone. No one leaves.

37:12.350 --> 37:13.729
I'm gonna say 43 pounds.

37:13.852 --> 37:14.852
More.

37:17.605 --> 37:19.000
Too late, got to move her.

37:21.778 --> 37:22.778
Now.

37:31.412 --> 37:33.877
Everyone, please stay where you are.

37:35.356 --> 37:36.961
Gibbs, you got to let me go, please.

37:37.042 --> 37:38.116
No one leaves.

37:44.841 --> 37:45.982
Listen up, everyone.

37:46.236 --> 37:47.764
It's not here.

37:49.369 --> 37:50.516
It never was.

37:50.932 --> 37:52.829
There's no cause for alarm.

37:53.254 --> 37:54.724
Please, everyone, stay...

38:02.680 --> 38:04.155
Keep everyone inside.

38:15.072 --> 38:16.072
Drive now!

38:26.591 --> 38:27.804
Hey, pal, you can't...

38:57.789 --> 39:00.086
Boss, Tony's got Amanda.
She's safe.

40:00.805 --> 40:01.897
Thank you.

40:06.054 --> 40:07.348
Found Bankston's wife.

40:07.872 --> 40:09.822
Buried in back of
an old rental property.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.272
He killed her 12 months ago.

40:12.567 --> 40:14.952
He planted her hair
in the cabin as insurance

40:15.393 --> 40:17.038
in case he got caught.

40:17.768 --> 40:20.448
Thought he was gonna walk out
of that bar with Domino in his pocket.

40:20.776 --> 40:22.502
This guy thought of everything.

40:23.805 --> 40:24.805
Not everything.

40:26.689 --> 40:29.100
It's probably the best way
for it to end.

40:30.710 --> 40:32.512
Treason, double murder.

40:33.636 --> 40:35.444
She was headed for a life sentence.

40:35.504 --> 40:36.504
Or worse.

40:37.342 --> 40:39.519
She was never gonna see
her sister again.

40:44.331 --> 40:46.150
SECNAV wants Domino back.

40:57.099 --> 40:58.830
It never left the building, Leon.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.134
I need everyone to think it was real.

41:11.019 --> 41:12.019
Even me.

41:16.148 --> 41:18.206
So, what are you going to tell her?

41:20.458 --> 41:22.369
Lee a hero or a villain?

41:25.334 --> 41:26.334
Both.

41:31.075 --> 41:32.209
Red apples.

41:33.624 --> 41:34.948
That's good, Amanda.

41:35.398 --> 41:37.743
Breakfast is served, my lady.

41:38.398 --> 41:40.088
- A chocolate chip cookie.
- Thank you.

41:40.148 --> 41:41.330
And some hot cocoa.

41:42.587 --> 41:44.625
Your aunt will be
here soon to pick you up.

41:47.772 --> 41:50.293
Thank you for helping me
with my drawing, Ziva.

41:54.307 --> 41:56.220
You are one brave little girl.

41:57.417 --> 41:58.417
Where's Michy?

42:15.383 --> 42:17.199
What happened to your hand?

42:29.837 --> 42:31.936
Michy would want you to have that.
