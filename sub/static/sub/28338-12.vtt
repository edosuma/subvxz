WEBVTT

00:04.001 --> 00:05.831
Whoa!

00:05.831 --> 00:10.251
Kelly's world is... hairy.

00:10.251 --> 00:12.581
All right, let's see here.

00:12.581 --> 00:14.461
Kelly's house should be...

00:14.461 --> 00:16.291
Oh! There it is!

00:16.291 --> 00:20.291
All right. One small step
for Marco,

00:20.291 --> 00:22.291
and I'm not sure
what I'm steppin' on.

00:24.081 --> 00:27.701
OK. Just gonna pretend
this is a normal house.

00:27.701 --> 00:28.871
[grunting]

00:28.871 --> 00:30.041
[doorbell rings]

00:30.041 --> 00:31.701
You're killin' it, Diaz.

00:33.831 --> 00:37.371
Oh! Uh, hi there. I'm Marco.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.461
[Marco]
Is... Kelly around?

00:40.461 --> 00:43.161
And he's gone.
Is this the right house?

00:43.161 --> 00:44.791
Ow! [grunts]

00:44.791 --> 00:46.201
Uh--

00:46.201 --> 00:48.581
Stand and face me, boy!

00:48.581 --> 00:52.161
Dad? What's going on out here?

00:52.161 --> 00:54.121
This is your dad?!
He was trying to--

00:54.121 --> 00:56.251
Fight you? Oh, yeah.

00:56.251 --> 00:58.701
That's just how us Wooletts
say hello.

00:58.701 --> 01:01.291
Dad, cool it.
You're freaking Marco out.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.001
Oh, right, right, sorry.

01:03.001 --> 01:05.291
Well, now that we're
acquainted, Marco,

01:05.291 --> 01:06.581
let me give you a hand.

01:06.581 --> 01:08.121
-[Marco yelps]
-[Kelly] Dad!

01:08.121 --> 01:11.081
Uh... hey...

01:11.081 --> 01:13.371
So, Marco, what
brings you here?

01:13.371 --> 01:16.161
Well, we talked about
making tortas a while ago.

01:16.161 --> 01:18.291
So, I brought over
a few ingredients.

01:18.291 --> 01:21.461
At least, they were
ingredients.

01:21.461 --> 01:25.661
-Cool. Let's, uh,
make some tortas.
-[bell rings on TV]

01:25.661 --> 01:29.121
I'm gonna comb you over
real good!

01:29.121 --> 01:32.081
Not if I get
to those split ends first!

01:32.081 --> 01:34.701
Jus-just kidding.
Your-- you hair looks amazing.

01:34.701 --> 01:36.331
[Wrestler #1]
Thanks for noticing.

01:36.331 --> 01:38.291
But I'll never reveal
my conditioner!

01:38.291 --> 01:40.331
-[bell rings on TV]
-Is something wrong?

01:40.331 --> 01:43.661
Sorry. I just haven't
felt like doing anything

01:43.661 --> 01:46.501
or talking to anyone lately.

01:46.501 --> 01:50.461
Yeah. I know it's been hard
since Tad... you know.

01:50.461 --> 01:52.291
[cell phone vibrating]

01:52.291 --> 01:54.961
Ugh! He just won't
stop calling!

01:54.961 --> 01:56.331
Uh, who won't stop calling?

01:56.331 --> 01:58.911
-Tad!
-Tad's alive?!

01:58.911 --> 02:00.291
But he's still dead to me.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.371
What happened?

02:02.371 --> 02:07.041
After the battle,
he ended up joining
this creepy self-help group

02:07.041 --> 02:09.331
and started acting
all self-righteous.

02:09.331 --> 02:12.161
He's become...a nester.

02:12.161 --> 02:13.501
What?

02:13.501 --> 02:15.201
-[phone beeps]
- Namaste, Kelly.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.201
How's it been?
Just wanted to say

02:17.201 --> 02:20.831
- how great I've been doing
since we broke up.
-Yeesh.

02:20.831 --> 02:24.201
Now that I'm free
of all that negative energy,

02:24.201 --> 02:26.371
- I'm a provider now.
-[birds chirping]

02:26.371 --> 02:29.001
It's like, life isn't really
worth living

02:29.001 --> 02:32.751
unless you're really
making a difference
in the world.

02:32.751 --> 02:34.411
-[mother bird vomits]
- Anyways, gotta go!

02:34.411 --> 02:37.371
- Mother bird provides.
-[phone beeps]

02:37.371 --> 02:40.041
"Mother bird provides." Ugh!

02:40.041 --> 02:43.201
I'm sorry, Marco. I'm just
in a weird place right now.

02:43.201 --> 02:46.121
Besides, I got a bunch
of boring errands to do today.

02:46.121 --> 02:48.541
This library book's
not gonna return itself.

02:48.541 --> 02:51.161
Well, I don't mind
running to the library with you.

02:51.161 --> 02:53.371
Really? But it's so boring.

02:53.371 --> 02:55.041
Then we can make it fun
together!

02:55.041 --> 02:57.621
All right. But don't say
I didn't warn you!

02:57.621 --> 02:59.251
Yes, ma'am!

02:59.251 --> 03:03.251
Oh! Ugh! What is this?

03:03.251 --> 03:04.541
You don't want
to be caught outside

03:04.541 --> 03:06.661
without your hair on,
do you?

03:06.661 --> 03:09.291
Besides, you're gonna need
the extra padding.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.411
Trust me.

03:10.411 --> 03:13.001
Oh. That's not ominous at all.

03:13.001 --> 03:15.911
Bye, Mom! We're off
to the library!

03:15.911 --> 03:19.461
Bye, sweetie! Don't forget
the family ancestral sword!

03:19.461 --> 03:21.411
Yeah, Mom.

03:21.411 --> 03:23.251
Whaaaat?

03:23.251 --> 03:26.461
So, the library's downtown.
We'll need to take the bus.

03:26.461 --> 03:29.121
Huh? Oh, man,
I'm late for work!

03:29.121 --> 03:31.041
Have a good day, sweetie!

03:31.041 --> 03:33.121
-One, please! [groans]
-I don't know why

03:33.121 --> 03:34.831
I haven't gotten around
to visiting you sooner!

03:34.831 --> 03:36.661
Two for the downtown express,
please!

03:36.661 --> 03:37.871
Oh! Let me get 'em!

03:37.871 --> 03:40.621
Two for the downtown
expr-- [grunts]

03:40.621 --> 03:43.461
So, there's no money
used here?

03:43.461 --> 03:45.331
Everything's done by fighting?

03:45.331 --> 03:46.871
Yep! Everything.

03:46.871 --> 03:48.291
Movie tickets are two punches,

03:48.291 --> 03:50.501
a hamburger is a kick
and a jab.

03:50.501 --> 03:53.121
My uncle bought a yacht once.
He's still in the hospital.

03:53.121 --> 03:55.371
Excuse me, young man,

03:55.371 --> 03:58.501
but c-could I fight you
for that seat of yours?

03:58.501 --> 04:00.461
Oh, no-no-no-no, please.
Just take it.

04:00.461 --> 04:01.501
Whaaa--?

04:01.501 --> 04:03.121
[all gasp]

04:03.121 --> 04:04.291
I-is something wrong?

04:04.291 --> 04:06.871
Marco! You can't just
turn down a fight.

04:06.871 --> 04:10.501
That is the most shameful thing
you can say to a Woolett!

04:10.501 --> 04:14.161
Yeah! How dare you
disrespect that old lady?

04:14.161 --> 04:15.541
If you won't fight her,
I will!

04:15.541 --> 04:17.621
Hey! I was gonna fight
the old lady!

04:17.621 --> 04:20.251
I'll fight both of ya
to fight her! [screams]

04:20.251 --> 04:23.411
[all shouting indistinctly]

04:23.411 --> 04:24.751
Let's get outta here.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.581
[barking]

04:29.581 --> 04:32.751
Sorry this dumb errand
is taking way more time
than it should.

04:32.751 --> 04:35.371
I don't mind. I always have fun
when I'm around you.

04:35.371 --> 04:38.791
Thanks, but you don't
have to say that.

04:38.791 --> 04:41.541
Hey, since you guys
are so into fighting,

04:41.541 --> 04:43.161
do you have any Dojos
around here?

04:43.161 --> 04:44.621
What's a Dojo?

04:44.621 --> 04:48.461
You know, a place you go
to practice your sweet moves.

04:48.461 --> 04:50.161
[makes fighting sounds]

04:50.161 --> 04:51.291
Wool-hair-do!

04:51.291 --> 04:52.541
Wool-what-now?

04:52.541 --> 04:53.831
Wool-hair-do!

04:53.831 --> 04:57.041
It's the ancient martial art
of Woolania!

04:57.041 --> 05:00.161
Whoa! This looks
just like karate!

05:00.161 --> 05:02.371
But hairier!
In a good way!

05:02.371 --> 05:04.831
My dad taught me
to do these moves
when I was a toddler.

05:04.831 --> 05:07.541
It was the first fighting style
that I ever learned.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.411
Whoa, what's goin' on here?

05:09.411 --> 05:11.791
Oh, that's Dual Mode.
To do that,

05:11.791 --> 05:15.291
you and your partner
have to be totally in sync
with each other.

05:15.291 --> 05:18.461
Like, uh, two Wooletts
with one mind.

05:18.461 --> 05:20.621
Looks fun! You wanna
try it out?

05:20.621 --> 05:23.411
Oh, I've never been able
to pull it off myself,

05:23.411 --> 05:25.201
but how 'bout
one of these guys?

05:25.201 --> 05:27.411
Whoa! How is that
even possible?

05:27.411 --> 05:30.251
Yeah. It's illegal in, like,
12 dimensions.

05:30.251 --> 05:32.911
[Marco] Well, I won't tell
if you won't tell.

05:37.251 --> 05:40.541
Wow. If I could pull off
a roundhouse kick like that,

05:40.541 --> 05:42.251
I'd just roundhouse kick
all day.

05:42.251 --> 05:44.201
[chuckles]
That's the dream, right?

05:44.201 --> 05:46.411
[cell phone vibrates]

05:46.411 --> 05:49.161
Ugh! It's Tad again!

05:49.161 --> 05:51.371
Why won't he just
leave me alone?

05:51.371 --> 05:53.121
You could just block him.

05:53.121 --> 05:54.621
-Really?
-Yeah, it's pretty simple.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.251
Just press this button
right here.

05:57.251 --> 05:59.461
-Huh. I gotcha.
-[phone beeps]

05:59.461 --> 06:02.831
Wow. I cannot believe
I didn't know about that.

06:02.831 --> 06:04.621
Wait a minute.
Is that the time?

06:04.621 --> 06:06.791
The library closes
in five minutes!

06:06.791 --> 06:08.461
Hey! Hey! Don't worry.

06:08.461 --> 06:10.501
If it's a fight they want,
I'm sure we can take 'em.

06:10.501 --> 06:13.501
Marco, no! We don't play
when it comes to library fines.

06:13.501 --> 06:16.461
If I'm late, I have
to cut off my hair!

06:16.461 --> 06:20.411
-What?!
-Yeah. So let's book it!

06:20.411 --> 06:21.581
[panting]

06:22.581 --> 06:24.371
[beeps]

06:24.371 --> 06:26.461
OK, you're all set, dear.

06:26.461 --> 06:28.961
Oh, and could you tell
your mother "hello" from me?

06:28.961 --> 06:29.961
-[loud punch]
-Aah!

06:29.961 --> 06:32.411
[panting] Book!

06:32.411 --> 06:33.791
[dings]

06:33.791 --> 06:35.081
[beeping]

06:35.081 --> 06:37.041
Oh, wow.
This was due yesterday.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.461
What?!

06:38.461 --> 06:40.661
I'm afraid you'll have to pay
the overdue fee.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.501
Let's make this quick.

06:46.501 --> 06:47.911
Now, hold on!

06:47.911 --> 06:49.661
Don't bother, Marco.

06:49.661 --> 06:52.831
Everything in my life
is a mess right now.

06:52.831 --> 06:56.581
What's one more situation
that I can't control?

06:56.581 --> 06:59.461
[sighs] Life is cruel.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.871
-Yes, it is!
-[Marco] No!

07:01.871 --> 07:04.081
Uh, if Kelly doesn't want
to cut her hair,

07:04.081 --> 07:05.911
then she shouldn't have to!

07:05.911 --> 07:09.461
Librarian lady, I challenge you
to a fight!

07:09.461 --> 07:11.961
If I win, you let Kelly
keep her hair.

07:11.961 --> 07:16.371
[laughs] You know,
I've always wanted
to fight a Mewman.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.291
Actually, I'm a human.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.911
Yeah, you are.
A soft, squishy human

07:21.911 --> 07:24.701
who just threw away
his padded Hairsuit.

07:24.701 --> 07:26.871
-Oh.
-Well, I guess
we're doing this!

07:26.871 --> 07:30.331
OK. Just so you know.
Librarians are extremely
powerful

07:30.331 --> 07:33.291
and fight pretty dirty,
so, uh, use this.

07:33.291 --> 07:36.251
Whoa! Is this your family's
ancestral sword?

07:36.251 --> 07:38.541
No! Why would I
give that to you?

07:38.541 --> 07:40.661
Found it!

07:40.661 --> 07:43.291
This is my family
ancestral sword!

07:43.291 --> 07:44.701
Oh, dang!

07:44.701 --> 07:45.961
Ready?

07:45.961 --> 07:47.661
OK, you take
the left two arms,

07:47.661 --> 07:50.461
I'll take the right.
And, uh, try not to die.

07:50.461 --> 07:52.291
No promises.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.621
[all grunting]

07:53.621 --> 07:55.371
Take that!

07:55.371 --> 07:56.371
[exclaims, grunts]

07:57.701 --> 08:00.621
Ooh, that makes me angry!

08:00.621 --> 08:03.041
[both grunting]

08:03.041 --> 08:04.581
-Aah!
-Kelly!

[grunts]

08:06.751 --> 08:09.041
[all grunting]

-[Librarian growling]
-[Hair Ninjas exclaiming]

08:18.041 --> 08:20.041
Hey, you know what might be
a good idea?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.831
Wool-hair-do?

08:21.831 --> 08:23.961
Yah!

08:23.961 --> 08:25.751
[all exclaiming]

08:25.751 --> 08:28.791
-[Kelly exclaims]
-[grunts] You punched
my butt! Oh!

08:28.791 --> 08:30.701
[Kelly and Marco]
The Top-Knotted Double Fist!

08:30.701 --> 08:33.371
[all grunting indistinctly]

08:35.121 --> 08:37.411
[Kelly and Marco]
Legendary Side Bang Sweep!

08:37.411 --> 08:39.751
[growling]

08:39.751 --> 08:41.001
Huh?

08:44.701 --> 08:47.701
[Kelly and Marco]
The Twist Out of Destruction!

08:48.751 --> 08:50.331
[both grunt]

08:52.661 --> 08:55.001
-Oh, my gosh! That was amazing!
-Oh! You were amazing!

08:55.001 --> 08:56.661
-Um, I cannot believe
we just pulled off Dual Mode!
-That twirling thing you did!

08:56.661 --> 08:57.791
And then we were like, "whoosh"
up in the air!

08:57.791 --> 08:59.621
It was like I had
your mind or something.

08:59.621 --> 09:00.791
I didn't even know fighting
could feel that way!

09:00.791 --> 09:01.791
I've never felt
that way before!

09:01.791 --> 09:02.961
[both laughing]

09:02.961 --> 09:04.581
[both sigh]

09:04.581 --> 09:06.331
[cell phone vibrating]

09:06.331 --> 09:07.411
Uh...

09:09.621 --> 09:12.621
-[phone beeps]
-[Tad] You, Kells.
It's me again. Tad.

09:12.621 --> 09:16.581
Your ex. Saw a tree,
and it reminded me of you.

09:16.581 --> 09:18.501
I thought you blocked him.

09:18.501 --> 09:19.791
-[phone beeps]
-[Kelly sighs]

09:19.791 --> 09:22.121
I-- I couldn't do it.

09:22.121 --> 09:25.791
I know it's not smart,
and I am ready to move on,
but...

09:25.791 --> 09:29.911
Actually, I think I might know
how you feel.

09:29.911 --> 09:32.331
I mean, I don't want
to have feelings for Star,

09:32.331 --> 09:36.751
'cause they're getting
in the way of...
other feelings.

09:36.751 --> 09:39.791
Oh. Wow, yeah, then, um...

09:39.791 --> 09:44.701
I guess you do know
exactly how I feel.

09:44.701 --> 09:47.161
[chuckling nervously]
Oh, yeah. Cool.

09:47.161 --> 09:51.791
Sure is a bummer
about the timing
of these feelings.

break-up buddies?

10:08.701 --> 10:09.871
What's that?

10:09.871 --> 10:12.501
Well, you kinda
help each other

10:12.501 --> 10:14.041
forget your old feelings.

10:14.041 --> 10:16.961
So you can move on.

Also, you can kiss.
When the mood is
weirdly romantic.
