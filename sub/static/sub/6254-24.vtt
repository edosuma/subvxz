The trail’s been closed

[ Booth ]
Wow. Looks like he’s
been here for a while.

03:38.135 --> 03:41.753
Animal scavenging is the reason
why most of the tissue is gone.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.882
Based on the size of the blowfly larvae,
I’d say our victim’s only been dead
about five days.

Projectile trauma to
the base of the occipital.

Okay, I think we’re safe
calling this one a murder.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.442
Gonial angle of the mandible
indicates the victim was male.

03:56.529 --> 03:59.441
The wear on his teeth shows
that he was in his mid—50s.

03:59.532 --> 04:01.397
Caucasian, from
the shape of the palate.

04:01.492 --> 04:05.076
At least one shot was taken
at the picnic table.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.369
Blood soaked into the wood,
and we found a slug.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.947
That makes me
rethink the picnic
Ange and l were planning.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.749
Okay, the gunman approaches
the victim, he takes a shot,

04:12.837 --> 04:16.580

the gunman keeps shooting
until the guy’s dead.

04:16.674 --> 04:20.087
— It’s real simple, guys.
- I’m not sure how necessary
all these other shots were.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.008

04:47.872 --> 04:50.158
remodeled, probably
eight to 10 years old.

04:50.249 --> 04:53.332
So this isn’t
the first time he’s been
used for target practice.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.910

05:01.719 --> 05:04.961
He was shot 12 times.
Ballistics said the killer
used a U.S.P. nine—millimeter.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.511
That’s a weapon of choice
for a pro.

05:06.599 --> 05:09.306
There’s no evidence the victim
was eating at the picnic table,

05:09.393 --> 05:11.884
which means he was probably
lured there somehow.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.682

Okay, Dr. Brennan said
the kill shot was delivered
at the picnic table, right?

05:20.446 --> 05:22.858
Yeah.
So the victim didn’t run.

05:22.948 --> 05:26.941

Pelant doesn’t do something
like this and get away with it.

07:02.006 --> 07:04.042
It never feels good
to lose one of our own.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.669
The best way
to honor Friedlander...

07:05.759 --> 07:07.545
is to apprehend the person
who did this to him.

it could be Pelant?
Yes.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.428

He didn’t have any
living relatives.

through his case files.

a coincidence, Cher.

11:28.480 --> 11:32.564

when you shot me, Agent Booth.

to hurt you guys.

[ Brennan ]
Shot to the base of the occipital,
just like the previous victim.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.661
And multiple shots
to the rest of the body.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.917
Well, Pelant doesn’t
do anything randomly.

11:57.009 --> 12:01.127
I’ll upload these photos
and see if the wounds
match the previous set.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.961
Nine—millimeter,
just like the other victim.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.466
Probably from the same U.S.P.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.140
Booth should know about this.
Can you call him
on a burner cell?

12:07.227 --> 12:11.516
I told Booth we should stay
on the grid— computers,
phones, everything.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.229
But Pelant
will find a way in.
[Angela] I know.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.649
And when he does,
I’ll be able to track him.

12:15.736 --> 12:19.320
Maybe you should ask Booth
to remove himself from the case.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.483
I couldn’t.
That’s his decision.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.611
lt’s Pelant, and he’s
targeting F.B.l.—
No.

12:26.705 --> 12:29.697
We need Booth to get Pelant.
There’s no one better.
You both know that.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.290
Please tell Booth
about the bullets.
Sure.

12:33.462 --> 12:36.920
There are remodeled injuries
to the right tibia.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.668
Oh, l-l should do that.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.875

12:40.969 --> 12:43.676
Okay, well,
then I’ll help.

Bites from a dog.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.437
Same Harris lines.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.516
This injury
is from 10 years ago,
just like Friedlander’s.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.195
And his records from
that time are missing too.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.782
Crystal Creek?
That was in West Virginia
10 years ago.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.080
Friedlander and Stone
were attacked
by their guard dogs...

13:12.209 --> 13:14.916
the day that we
stormed the compound.
Why wasn’t that in his files?

13:15.003 --> 13:16.709
Or the gunshot wounds?

13:16.797 --> 13:19.834
The files of the agents
that were injured that day
were moved to a secure location.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.962
Does that sweet doctor of yours know
you were at Crystal Creek too?

13:23.053 --> 13:25.260
That’s something
you don’t talk about
if you don’t have to.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.384
All right, so what,
is Pelant getting political?

13:28.475 --> 13:31.308
So you think Pelant
is getting political,
killing agents for revenge?

13:31.395 --> 13:32.885
No, Pelant’s
not killing anyone.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.345
He’s working through
a surrogate.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.691
A few years ago,
I wrote an analysis...

13:36.775 --> 13:39.767
involving the pathology
of manipulation and
victim vulnerability.

13:39.903 --> 13:43.111
Okay, just speak so
we don’t need an interpreter.
It’s pretty simple.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.984
There were survivors
at the compound.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.111
Children who saw
their parents
and siblings die.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.817
That’s a wound
that never heals.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.120
Any one of them’s
a perfect target for Pelant.
He guarantees revenge.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.947
I’m sure Pelant says
“closure.”

13:54.042 --> 13:55.623
Because that’s what
you say in your paper?

13:55.711 --> 13:57.121
Yeah.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.371
Pelant’s using my work
against us.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.584
Fortunately, I’m more
familiar with it than he is.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.275
I tried to retrieve
surveillance video
from the crime scene,

14:21.361 --> 14:24.524
but all the cameras
feed into central servers
that were wiped clean.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.105
So Pelant can access
any security camera?

Yeah, any one with
an Internet connection.

right now.

Hey, we’re gonna
get him, Hodgins.
You know that we will.

14:47.179 --> 14:49.670
I should’ve killed him
when I had the chance.

14:53.643 --> 14:58.012

they’re my fault.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.639

You should’ve told me.

I did.
As soon as it mattered.
You could be the next target.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.212
Come on, Bones.
You’re the logical one.
That’s too easy for Pelant.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.922
I just know
that men are dying.
Men like you.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.178
I am not going to die.
Understand?

sees this as a game.
That is why he called me.

He called to say that
the rules were changing.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.397

If I’m gone and you’re gone,
then the game is over.

throw us off.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.982
Has the FBI. kept track of
the Crystal Creek survivors?

16:30.073 --> 16:32.735
No. Most were kids,
so they had no cause.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.862
Plus, with all the lawsuits
and conspiracy theories,

16:34.953 --> 16:36.909
they don’t want
the public to think they
were spying, you know?

16:36.997 --> 16:39.704
Yeah, and Pelant knew all that,
so his surrogate wouldn’t
be traceable.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.371
But I have indicators
and key words we can use
to screen for potential candidates.

16:43.461 --> 16:47.045
Well, I imagine we’d start
with “Crystal Creek,”
“cover—up” and “FBI.”

16:47.132 --> 16:48.963
And “violation of rights.”

that their parents’ fate
might be theirs.

Wasn’t Crystal Creek
a religious cult?

16:54.973 --> 16:57.589
That’s next.
Input “sin” and “wicked.”

16:58.643 --> 17:01.806

“Judas” and “wrath.”

“Revenge”?

No, that’s not
how he’ll see it.

I can’t tell.
Could be a rifle or a shotgun.

I answer to.

[Booth]
Yes. 0fcourse. Yes.

24:34.932 --> 24:38.390
I was reexamining the bullet wounds
to see if there’s any pattern
to the injuries.

24:38.478 --> 24:42.471
Angela and Hodgins are
looking for any kind of code
using cryptological analysis.

24:42.607 --> 24:45.394
I don’t think
that’s necessary.
But you just said—

24:45.485 --> 24:48.943
I believe Pelant wants us to
believe it is a complex code,
but it’s actually quite simple.

24:49.072 --> 24:52.235
What kind of bullets
were the victims shot with?
Copperjacket, lead core.

24:52.325 --> 24:56.534
You see these two slit-like
exit wounds in the scapula?

24:56.621 --> 24:59.408
I originally believed they came
from two different shots,

24:59.499 --> 25:01.911
but they have
no marginal abrasions.

25:02.001 --> 25:06.165
So the copperjacket separated
from the lead core after
the bullet entered the body.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.382
One bullet,
two exit wounds.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.832
Agent Friedlander
wasn’t shot 12 times.

25:10.927 --> 25:13.384
Which means both victims
were shot 11 times.

25:13.471 --> 25:15.587
And with Pelant involved,
that can’t be a coincidence.

25:15.723 --> 25:19.591
Hey, where have you been?
I was worried about you.
I’ve been here, working.

25:19.727 --> 25:23.686
Not an hour ago,

Oh, I was with Booth.

25:23.773 --> 25:27.641
Oh. I thought that Pelant
had taken you or something.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.271
I was asking him
to marry me.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.693
What?

25:30.780 --> 25:34.068
- I was asking Booth
to marry me.
- Oh, my God.

25:34.200 --> 25:38.819

Congratulations. That—
That’s wonderful news.

25:38.913 --> 25:41.700
Odd timing,
but w—wonderful.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.327
Yeah. Wait a minute.
Why now?

25:43.418 --> 25:46.535
What happened?
And this is crazy and great.

25:46.629 --> 25:49.211
I used simple
evidence—based logic.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.131
When I thought
about living with Booth
for the rest of my life,

25:52.218 --> 25:56.507
my phenylethylamine and ghrelin levels
were clearly elevated, but—

25:56.597 --> 25:59.304
You can just say
it felt right.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.678
It did. It does.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.634
It’s clearly irrational,

26:03.730 --> 26:08.770
but I feel I could
never find a better man
to spend my life with.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.190

26:15.825 --> 26:17.656
[ Chuckles ]

26:19.162 --> 26:22.529
And I thought
that should be recorded
for the world to know.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.909
I also discovered what ties
these murders together.

26:25.001 --> 26:28.835
— Wait, that’s it for
the-the marriage thing?
— You expected more?

26:28.921 --> 26:32.379
Both victims were shot
11 times, deliberately.

26:32.467 --> 26:36.460
What we thought was a 12th shot
was a bullet separating in the body.

26:36.554 --> 26:40.968
A simple numerical repetition.
It’s—It’s too simple for Pelant.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.594
Which is why
we overlooked it.

26:42.685 --> 26:46.519
So what ties the FBI, Crystal Creek
and the number 11 together then?

26:46.606 --> 26:48.096
That’s what
we need to find out.

26:48.191 --> 26:52.400
Perhaps first you can see
if Booth has any link
to the number 11.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.238
Booth?
Yeah?

26:57.325 --> 26:59.407
I don’t believe Pelant’s
surrogate’s an agent.

26:59.494 --> 27:02.611
You realize you’ve been
changing your mind about this
every two seconds.

27:02.705 --> 27:06.038
I know, I know. But he’s using
bits and pieces from over
10 papers I’ve written.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.037
He wants me to be disoriented,
but I’m positive about this.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.086
You’re positive?
I didn’t think shrinks could
be positive about anything.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.959
Another paper of mine
he’s referencing...

27:14.050 --> 27:18.089
focuses on the indices
of abnormal adolescent
and postadolescent behavior.

27:18.179 --> 27:19.635
Wait a second.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.838
Kid again?
That’s what led us
to Zane Reynolds.

27:21.933 --> 27:25.016
Right. But Reynolds
had the ability
to channel his rage.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.388

a new identity for himself
so that he could—

27:27.480 --> 27:29.061

Why are you smiling?

27:30.608 --> 27:32.223
This is not appropriate.
Sorry.

to marry her.

27:34.237 --> 27:35.727
What? Really?

27:35.822 --> 27:37.687
Yes, and she did it
with jerky.

he’s the most important.

Okay, well, that’s
his problem, not mine.
Right.

I’m just saying,
psychologically, he can’t
accept being replaced—

28:01.806 --> 28:03.467
It could cause him
to escalate.

28:03.558 --> 28:05.924
It could cause him to slip up too.
Let me just tell you something, Sweets.

28:06.060 --> 28:09.598
I’ve been waiting for this moment
for along, long time,
and it’s finally here.

28:09.689 --> 28:13.102
There’s no way that Pelant’s
gonna take that away from me.

28:16.153 --> 28:17.939
We’ve been looking
in the wrong place.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.818
It wasn’t someone avenging
the deaths of the people in
that compound in Crystal Creek.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.991
Well, who else
would want to murder
those agents?

28:24.078 --> 28:25.784
A child of one of the agents
who was killed there.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.363
Three of the agents
were killed that day.

28:28.457 --> 28:31.870
One of them was shot 11 times,
including once to the back
of the head,

28:31.961 --> 28:33.667
just like our two victims.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.961
His name is Harris Samuels.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.915
I got his F.B.I. file,
and there are a ton of details
about his family in there.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.214
They do that in case
the family wants protection.
He’s a single father.

28:42.305 --> 28:45.388
His daughter, Anna,
was orphaned after he was
killed at Crystal Creek.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.556
Yeah, he used to
take her hunting, right?
Taught her to shoot.

28:47.643 --> 28:50.180
She was a marksman first—class
by the time she was 10.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.807
And she blames the FBI.
for his death?

28:51.898 --> 28:53.388
The files were sealed...

28:53.482 --> 28:55.518
because there was
so much controversy
surrounding the assault.

28:55.610 --> 28:58.192

died from friendly fire,

28:58.279 --> 29:00.190
even though
two independent

29:00.281 --> 29:02.738
proved that they died
because of shots
from the compound.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.031
It might not matter to Anna.

her father was killed,

gets ahold of these files,

avenge her father.

You’re all right?

Yeah, yeah, l’m fine,

hacked the lights.

You were supposed
to meet the shooter,
but you’re just a decoy

- The target is Sweets.
- Where’s Sweets?

He’s at Harding and Avenue H.

to meet— she’s the shooter.

All right, look,
send a chopper in.
[ Ange/a / Can ’t.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.895
Pelant scrambled
the guidance systems.

He’s knocked out

34:36.700 --> 34:39.737
Look, I’m close.
I can get there.
Sweets does not die today.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.781

You can’t.

34:41.872 --> 34:43.703
No, he is out there alone.

shut down his entire network.
He’s off the grid.

We’ll take what we can get.

— What about the girl? She talking?
— It’s gonna take some time.

to Pelant, it’s our shrink.

You’re the man. Don’t blow it.

I hate to cut short

You two got to go practice
the marriage dance.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.378
I thought you’d want
some weird tribal wedding,

37:45.472 --> 37:47.428
and I’d have to pay for you
in giraffes.

37:49.726 --> 37:52.968
The archaic Catholic wedding ritual
is important to you.

37:53.063 --> 37:57.557
And even as an atheist,
I can see the beauty in it.
Plus, I speak Latin.

You don’t get
to decide that.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.831
But I do.
I always make the decisions.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.758
And Dr. Brennan
can ’t know the reason
