00:01.418 --> 00:03.253
<i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.214
<i>These visions that you're having,
don't ignore them.</i>

00:05.422 --> 00:08.133
The unconscious
is a very powerful thing.

00:08.217 --> 00:11.678
I heard rumors about unkillable Zs.
The virus mutating.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.390
<i>You start to wonder
if something's happening out there.</i>

00:15.474 --> 00:17.184
-[Doc] <i>What's up with Warren?</i>
- [Murphy]<i>She's all there.</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:20.979
But it seems like there's more there there
than there used to be.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.356
She's going the wrong way.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.810
Oh. Hope they're not <i>all</i>
gonna be that hard to kill.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.205
Why can't the virus mutate
into happy peace-loving zombies

01:20.289 --> 01:22.499
that crave weed instead of brains?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.334
Let's get moving. Let's go.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.430
Murphy! Catch up!

01:36.513 --> 01:39.224
You know, we must've lost
those Zona goons by now!

01:39.308 --> 01:41.560
Yeah, well, keep moving!

01:41.643 --> 01:43.812
What kind of ass menagerie.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.315
Looks like Satan's parking lot.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.275
They warned us about this
in our mission briefings.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.236
Officially, it's "Spontaneous
Mass Mortality Site number 247"

01:51.320 --> 01:53.655
But civilians call it "The Great Pile."

01:53.739 --> 01:55.240
Goes on for 200 square miles.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.242
No way around it.
No road through it.

01:57.326 --> 02:00.912
-Just one big no-go zone.
-And yet, here we go.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.749
Newmerica is looking better all the time.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.460
Roger that.

02:07.461 --> 02:11.381
You know, if I was a zombie,
and I am kind-of an honorary one,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.884
this is exactly the kind of place
I would hang out

02:13.967 --> 02:16.928
waiting to eat the brains of someone
stupid enough to come along.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.639
Murphy, move your ass!

02:32.444 --> 02:35.364
So, Warren, I don't mean
to be a buzzkill or anything

02:35.447 --> 02:39.076
on your mission from God
or whatever it is. But...

02:39.159 --> 02:41.119
do you have any idea
where the hell we're going?

02:41.953 --> 02:43.038
East.

02:46.875 --> 02:50.295
E-- East? What, just East?

02:50.379 --> 02:52.130
How far East?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.342
Not sure.

02:56.426 --> 03:00.097
But for now,
as far as we can go.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.144
Picking up anything?

03:08.480 --> 03:09.648
Everything.

03:29.835 --> 03:33.463
[Doc] So here we were,
marching through The Great Pile

03:33.547 --> 03:36.258
after eight years of apocalypse.

03:36.341 --> 03:40.804
Junk so thick, I wouldn't know a Z
if it was three feet in front of me.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.765
All of this on Lieutenant Warren's orders.

03:46.017 --> 03:49.062
I can't shake the feeling
this was all a big mistake.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.857
Are you talking to me?
'Cause I already know this stuff.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.776
Yeah, no, I'm just working
on my inner monologue.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.862
Well, try focusing on the "inner" part.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.321
[snarling softly]

04:06.913 --> 04:10.292
So when they briefed you,
what'd they tell you about this place?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.877
According to our intel,
a few years back,

04:11.960 --> 04:13.378
there was some sort of crazy
cult leader lady

04:13.462 --> 04:15.505
broadcasting out of a radio tower
near here.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.425
Claimed space aliens were gonna land
and take all the survivors

04:18.508 --> 04:21.344
to some zombie-free planet,
but... they didn't.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.264
[Murphy]
Well, that sounds insane.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.558
And oddly familiar.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.602
Faith is a crazy thing.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.687
[Doc]
Well, we've seen a whole lot of crazy.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.524
Almost a million people.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.652
-What happened to them?
-No one knows for sure.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.571
Some kind of mass die-off
turned them all Z.

04:39.654 --> 04:43.074
For some reason, all them Zeds
took off from this place en mass.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.327
Even Zs don't like this place.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.873
Last drone footage we have
shows the mother of all zombie hoards

04:49.956 --> 04:51.833
heading straight for the Grand Canyon.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.668
[both]
We were nowhere near the Grand Canyon.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.555
-[snarling]
-[man] My wife. Have you seen my wife?

05:05.639 --> 05:09.184
<i>Help me. Kill me.</i>

05:15.941 --> 05:19.569
-What?
-Nothing. Just...

05:19.653 --> 05:23.198
I wanted to check in
and make sure you're okay.

05:23.281 --> 05:26.201
-After Addy.
-Like you care.

05:26.284 --> 05:30.622
Of course I care. I'm your dad.
She was my friend, sort of.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.750
She was not your friend.
And you aren't my dad.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.170
My dad was blue.
My dad could talk to zombies.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.047
My dad could feel me
from across the country,

05:39.130 --> 05:40.590
and I could feel him.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.175
You aren't my dad.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.011
I am still your father.
You know, things change.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.805
You changed.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.891
-Zona cured me.
-You didn't need to be cured.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.227
You weren't some kind of disease
that needed to be cured!

05:52.310 --> 05:53.311
And neither am I!

06:11.621 --> 06:14.374
I can't believe we left Addy behind, too.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.960
Yeah, you've had to leave a lot behind.
Haven't you, kid?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.546
First 5K. Now Red.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.923
Red.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.053
Yeah, that's a tough one.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.224
Are you okay?

06:31.308 --> 06:33.059
-Not much choice.
-Huh?

06:34.894 --> 06:37.314
I wanted to stay and keep searching.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.525
-But we promised.
-Promised?

06:40.609 --> 06:43.320
Red and I,
if we were ever to be separated,

06:43.403 --> 06:46.573
we'd leave a sign
that we were still out there.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.326
With no sign of life, we'd move on.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.328
She made me promise.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.622
Well, that's the first rule
of the Apocalypse.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.290
You did the right thing.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.211
If she'd have turned,
I would have found her.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.213
Or she would've found you
and eaten your brains.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.884
She's alive, right?

07:05.967 --> 07:09.262
She probably went to...
Newmerica with the others.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.851
Yeah, well, you know,
hopefully Addy's with her.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.399
Sure like to zombify
that son of a bitch that shot Addy.

07:24.653 --> 07:28.198
Yeah, you know, 10K, about Addy...

07:29.491 --> 07:32.452
-Doc. Don't move.
-Is there something in my beard?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.038
No. Something's watching us.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.540
Something big.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.211
Mad Z?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.879
No. It's some kind of critter.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.428
-[squeaking and hissing]
-[screams]

08:04.317 --> 08:05.568
Rat Zs?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.697
Got him.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.491
[squeaking]

08:21.167 --> 08:22.544
Run!

08:26.548 --> 08:28.341
[screams]

08:55.243 --> 08:57.162
[electricity crackles]

09:17.766 --> 09:18.808
Help!

09:20.977 --> 09:22.145
Lucy!

09:24.731 --> 09:26.483
Lucy!

09:26.566 --> 09:27.567
Lucy?

09:30.779 --> 09:32.280
Where are you, sweetie?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.410
Lucy!

09:40.538 --> 09:41.831
Lucy!

09:44.584 --> 09:48.505
Somebody help me!! Help!!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.133
[metal thumping]

10:01.726 --> 10:04.395
Dad! No! Dad!

10:04.479 --> 10:05.480
Knock knock!

11:00.994 --> 11:02.328
[grunts]

11:18.052 --> 11:19.554
[gurgles and chokes]

11:24.934 --> 11:26.060
Lucy!

11:30.857 --> 11:32.233
Let me go.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.652
When my dad catches you,
he's so gonna kick your--

11:34.736 --> 11:36.029
[electricity crackles, Lucy groans]

11:42.869 --> 11:44.454
Zona sons of bitches.

12:27.914 --> 12:28.915
Behind you!

12:45.807 --> 12:47.392
[zombies snarling]

12:57.568 --> 13:01.572
Let me out! I'm almost gone!
Let me out! [screaming]

13:21.009 --> 13:22.927
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.514
Thanks for the help!
Where the hell were you guys?! Huh?

13:26.597 --> 13:28.891
Dude! Z rats?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.936
Heard the screams. Junk was too thick.
Got here as soon as I could.

13:32.020 --> 13:36.315
What about you, huh? Where were you?
You don't care about anyone else?

13:36.399 --> 13:39.819
Them, I care about.
You, not so much.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.738
-Shit!
-Hey, hey, hey!

13:41.821 --> 13:42.905
Come on, guys.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.367
How 'bout you, huh?

13:46.451 --> 13:48.703
You're leading us into the middle
of nowhere based on nothing!

13:49.037 --> 13:50.455
[machine-gun fire]

13:52.331 --> 13:55.418
What we have here
is a lack of unit cohesion.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.588
I didn't mercy my two best friends
to put up with this shit.

13:58.671 --> 14:02.884
She's right. Now come on, guys.
Teamwork makes the dream work.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.012
-Hippie's right.
-You're bleeding.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.724
-You okay?
-It's just a flesh wound.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.184
[Doc]
Okay, now everybody listen up.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.519
As your friendly neighborhood
mental health professional,

14:13.603 --> 14:17.065
it's my opinion that we need to stick
together and not go running off alone.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.025
Agreed?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.653
All right, well,
I'm glad we got that straight.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.086
Let's go, Murphy.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.556
So what about Sundays in Zona?

14:52.392 --> 14:56.062
Sunrise buffet, omelet station,
bottomless mimosas.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.940
We had bottomless stuff
at the camp, too.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.566
Wasn't mimosas.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.945
Yeah, Bottomless Joe.
What happened to him?

15:04.028 --> 15:07.782
Well, he died as he lived.
With no pants.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.575
-Hey, Luce.
-[snarling]

15:09.659 --> 15:11.160
What's your take on them Mad Zs?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.706
Well, with regular Zs,
I can hear their names,

15:15.790 --> 15:19.168
see flashes of their lives,
I can talk to them.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.379
Mad Zs, it's just screaming.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.214
-You can't command them at all?
-Nope.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.559
Why so blue?

15:34.642 --> 15:38.563
Well, my daughter's almost as old as me.
We have nothing in common.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.189
And I don't know
what the hell to say to her.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.445
You know, my dad wasn't perfect either.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.904
But he was there.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.282
And sometimes that's all you need.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.451
The rest is time.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.288
She likes you more than me,
you know?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.915
Mm-hmm.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.084
So does everybody.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.178
Um... this isn't right.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.681
-I'm off course.
-[Murphy] We were on course?

16:14.390 --> 16:17.018
-Let me guess. We're lost?
-Are we lost?

16:17.268 --> 16:18.352
[sneeze]

16:18.436 --> 16:19.896
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

16:21.147 --> 16:22.273
Who sneezed?

16:23.858 --> 16:25.401
-[sneeze]
-There!

16:25.485 --> 16:28.029
You, in the pile! Stand up
and show yourself or be mercied!

16:33.451 --> 16:37.121
-What is it?
-Looks like some kind of Ender.

16:37.205 --> 16:40.666
Hey, don't shoot him.
Better an Ender than a Mad Z.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.335
Easy. Easy.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.004
I don't know who he thinks
he's gonna scare wearing that thing.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.633
-Enders!
-[whoops]

16:49.467 --> 16:52.637
-Don't shoot!
-[snarls]

16:54.722 --> 16:56.682
-Hey! That's my bag!
-Whoa!

16:56.766 --> 16:58.768
[all shouting]

17:08.069 --> 17:09.070
Hey!

17:12.490 --> 17:13.658
[whoops]

17:24.085 --> 17:25.711
They smashed my kiwis.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.343
[grunts angrily]

17:32.426 --> 17:34.470
-They got our water.
-He got my bag.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.181
-Most of the ammo.
-Next time, can we just shoot them?

17:37.265 --> 17:39.642
Hey.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.186
Land-ho.
I can see the way out from here.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.606
Hallelujah!

17:45.690 --> 17:48.025
Warren, lead us to the promise land!

17:50.611 --> 17:53.197
Warren? Where the hell is she?

17:54.657 --> 17:55.825
Warren!

17:56.492 --> 17:58.661
-Where is she?
-There.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.745
[Murphy] Warren!

18:03.165 --> 18:05.459
Lucy! Come back here!

18:05.543 --> 18:07.837
Come on! We can get out this way!

18:07.920 --> 18:10.715
Sorry, Murph.
Looks like the craziest person wins.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.555
That's it.
It's time for a vision intervention.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.024
[squeals]

18:30.359 --> 18:32.028
[Warren]
All right, you got me here.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.365
What is this?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.535
This is an intervention.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.466
An intervention.

18:53.549 --> 18:59.513
Well, just think of it as words of concern
from people who love you.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.600
Okay. [clears throat]

19:02.683 --> 19:05.645
What are these words of concern?

19:07.063 --> 19:12.026
Well, you are leading us deeper and deeper
into the bowels of zombie hell.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.445
We're all gonna die horrible,
painful deaths,

19:14.528 --> 19:19.450
gnawed by zombie rats or worse
if we don't change course immediately.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.623
-Anyone want to back me up here?
-Murphy...

19:27.249 --> 19:29.377
Boss, look.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.880
You know, we believe in you.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.007
And we would follow you anywhere.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.426
But you're making decisions now
for all of us.

19:38.761 --> 19:42.139
And lately, these decisions are-- are--

19:43.140 --> 19:44.433
Are you trippin'?

19:44.517 --> 19:47.269
-I got something to say.
-Go ahead.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.233
Yeah, and Murphy's still acting
like he's the freaking blue messiah.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.609
It's really pissing me off.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.903
This is about Warren.
This is not a free-for-all.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.155
Oh. Warren?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.325
I got no problem with her.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.540
Seriously, Roberta.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.709
I mean, we want to believe.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.627
But you got to give us something
to believe in.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.219
I just feel it.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.931
I feel it in my gut.

20:24.014 --> 20:28.185
It's not something I can...
tell you with words.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.357
[voice breaks] I just feel it.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.902
What she's feeling is real.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.405
I feel it when I'm near her.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.614
What is it? I mean...

20:42.575 --> 20:46.162
Is it these visions of yours or these...

20:46.245 --> 20:48.581
the nightmares from your coma
or what?

20:50.916 --> 20:53.169
I don't know what they mean.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.338
Yeah, well, maybe we can help you,
you know, interpret them?

21:08.434 --> 21:09.643
I'm alone.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.690
Outside.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.780
And the sky's on fire.

21:24.742 --> 21:25.993
It's the end of the world.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.916
And there's a-- a black rainbow
that's blocking the sun.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.628
Then it starts to rain.

21:39.048 --> 21:44.470
It's a black ashen rain
that hisses in the air...

21:46.263 --> 21:48.182
and melts everything that it touches.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.893
Humans...

21:50.976 --> 21:52.228
Enders...

21:53.312 --> 21:54.522
Zombies.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.528
And when it--
when it hits my skin...

22:02.071 --> 22:03.823
it burns.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.032
[screaming]

22:16.085 --> 22:17.211
That's all I got.

22:27.721 --> 22:31.725
I'm sorry, but... that's not enough.

22:37.273 --> 22:40.359
-Newmerica.
-Newmerica.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.029
Newmerica.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.366
Newmerica.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.206
Addy said she'd meet me there.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.510
All right.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.931
I can't expect you to believe
in something that...

23:12.558 --> 23:14.310
I don't believe in myself.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.064
Newmerica.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.402
All of us together. And you.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.156
Yeah.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.994
Hallelujah.
Let's get the hell out of Zombietown.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.269
I won't let you down.

24:00.564 --> 24:01.649
Thank you.

24:08.489 --> 24:11.367
Single file. Eyes on me. Due North.

24:20.334 --> 24:23.837
You think we're wrong, don't you?
I can feel it.

24:29.593 --> 24:34.098
What I feel and what I know
are two different things.

24:34.181 --> 24:37.059
And what I know
is we got to get you to Newmerica.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.853
-For Addy.
-Right.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.647
-Yeah?
-For Addy.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.450
Hold up. Ender.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.202
Heavily armed.
Over there on the ground.

24:59.415 --> 25:02.626
-Say the word and I'll mercy him.
-I think that Ender's a Zombie.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.337
Garden variety.
Not one of them Mad Zs.

25:08.549 --> 25:09.842
His name is Alex.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.263
Check out the artillery on this guy.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.940
Looks like somebody stole
more than they could carry.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.985
Damn. That is a smorgasbord
of badassery.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.197
Well, speaking of weapons,
you guys all got guns and knives

25:32.281 --> 25:34.366
and shields and stuff.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.784
I feel like I need a weapon.

25:39.413 --> 25:42.124
What the hell am I supposed
to do with that, whittle someone to death?

25:42.207 --> 25:45.544
-It's not the size that counts.
-Keep telling yourself that, kid.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.755
If I'm gonna be fighting zombies,

25:47.838 --> 25:50.632
I feel like I need something substantial,
you know?

25:50.716 --> 25:53.177
There's something there for everybody.
Choose your weapon.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.554
[snarling softly]

25:56.388 --> 25:59.266
Let's see. BFG?

25:59.349 --> 26:02.227
Nah, too heavy.
Who wants to carry all that ammo?

26:02.311 --> 26:04.021
Grenade launcher.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.982
What about the pirate cutlass?
That's always good.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.777
It'll go with your whole,
you know, Blackbeard thing.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.654
He'd just cut himself.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.531
Probably right.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.116
-Oh, hey. Look at this.
-Freeze!

26:19.244 --> 26:20.621
Don't move.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.624
It's not stealing. He's dead... almost.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.501
Look. See?

26:28.212 --> 26:31.632
There's a grenade. It's a booby trap.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.009
Everybody, take cover, real easy.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.261
-I can get it, Lieutenant.
-Sergeant, you too.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.430
It's just the one.
And we need the weapons.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.015
Sergeant, that was an order!

26:44.520 --> 26:46.021
Sergeant!

26:58.408 --> 27:01.119
Got him! Ha ha! Store's open.

27:07.334 --> 27:11.296
Huh. All right. Let's see.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.424
Too hot. Too cold.

27:14.508 --> 27:15.592
Hey.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.179
That's perfect.

27:19.263 --> 27:22.683
A cane? You killing zombies
or doing a soft shoe?

27:22.766 --> 27:26.687
Maybe I should try this thing out
and mercy this poor bastard.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.106
-Dad!
-What?

27:33.193 --> 27:35.737
-Kids.
-At least she called me "dad."

27:57.217 --> 28:00.178
There it is. I see green.
We're almost out of here.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.391
Does anyone else smell zombie?

28:04.474 --> 28:07.686
[sniffs]
I'm only smelling myself.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.688
What are you scared of?
You got a cane.

28:09.771 --> 28:13.483
He's right.
There is something.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.777
Want to go North to Newmerica?
That's your way out.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.113
Let's go.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.217
[snarls]

28:48.185 --> 28:49.228
Little help.

28:53.649 --> 28:54.733
Hey!

29:26.306 --> 29:27.391
That's more like it.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.436
Let's get the hell out of here.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.325
Newmerica, here we come.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.455
-Where's Warren?
-She's right behind me.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.126
-[Lucy] Warren!
-[10K] Roberta!

29:54.209 --> 29:56.753
[Lucy] Warren! Warren!

29:59.047 --> 30:01.341
Lieutenant Warren!

30:01.425 --> 30:02.467
Warren!

30:08.432 --> 30:09.641
[Lucy, in distance] Warren!

30:15.147 --> 30:16.231
[Murphy] Warren!

30:16.315 --> 30:17.941
[zombies snarling]

32:03.088 --> 32:06.800
How can you have <i>déjà vu</i>
for a place you've never been?

32:40.625 --> 32:41.960
Where the hell is she?

32:42.043 --> 32:46.298
Well, we know she was heading East.
She said that.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.632
She ditched us.

32:47.716 --> 32:49.718
She's hoping we'll go to Newmerica
without her.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.221
Not the worst idea.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.974
We're not leaving anybody else behind.
I won't do it.

33:00.687 --> 33:04.774
Lucy? You can connect with Warren, right?

33:04.858 --> 33:06.860
Like you did with me before Zona?

33:08.320 --> 33:10.322
Yes.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.781
Can you find her?

33:12.866 --> 33:14.075
I could try.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.542
I feel something.

33:24.461 --> 33:25.545
This way.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.300
Lucy, slow down!

33:33.094 --> 33:36.389
It's just a Z. A regular one.

33:36.473 --> 33:39.100
-Lucy, get away from her.
-She's scared.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.685
What's your name?

33:41.353 --> 33:42.437
Audrey?

33:42.521 --> 33:44.606
Have you seen a woman
with blond hair running?

33:48.193 --> 33:50.612
-Okay. Let's get you out of here.
-Lucy, leave her alone!

33:57.160 --> 33:59.996
-Oh.
-Lucy? What is it?

34:00.080 --> 34:04.209
Stay back!
She's a bomb. Like the other one.

34:04.292 --> 34:07.295
Lucy, very slowly, walk away from her
and come towards me.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.923
No, you get away!
Or else we're all gonna blow up!

34:11.883 --> 34:13.426
-Don't!
-Dad, go!

34:13.510 --> 34:15.554
You're too normal!
You're making things worse!

34:15.637 --> 34:17.514
I am not going anywhere without you!

34:17.597 --> 34:18.807
-Lucy!
-You just walk away!

34:18.890 --> 34:19.975
[all snarling]

34:20.392 --> 34:22.310
[Murphy and Lucy arguing in distance]

34:23.436 --> 34:25.021
[Murphy]
You can't save everyone!

34:25.105 --> 34:27.566
I learned that a long time ago.
Now come with me.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.906
Someone has to make the time,
and I won't walk away!

34:34.990 --> 34:38.076
-She's not worth it. You'll get killed.
-I won't let her suffer!

34:38.159 --> 34:40.787
-Here come the locals!
-Time to skedaddle!

34:40.870 --> 34:42.497
All right. That's it.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.625
-It's time to go!
-No, I have to save her!

34:45.750 --> 34:48.503
You'll pull the pin.
Let me see if I can disable it.

34:51.548 --> 34:53.717
Crap. There's a dozen grenades.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.970
We've got a situation.
If she moves an inch, we're all dead.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.597
-Can you disarm it?
-That's a negative.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.015
Soon as you cut one wire,

35:00.098 --> 35:03.101
she'll move forward
and pull the other pins.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.187
[Doc] Puppies and kittens!

35:06.271 --> 35:09.357
Lucy, I am your father!
Do as I say and make her let go!

35:09.441 --> 35:12.611
You aren't my father! My father
would never leave her here to suffer!

35:12.694 --> 35:13.778
That's it.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.533
No!!

35:25.707 --> 35:28.084
Those pins are gonna pull.
This won't hold long.

35:28.168 --> 35:31.463
-All right, that's it. Come on!
-I'm not going anywhere with you!

35:31.546 --> 35:34.466
Fine! Then we'll blow
the hell up together!

35:34.549 --> 35:36.635
-We have gotta go!
-Guys!

35:42.432 --> 35:46.227
Baby Girl. She's gone.
You hear me? We gotta go.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.271
Go.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.440
Go! Go!

36:37.195 --> 36:39.531
[audio muffled]

37:01.928 --> 37:05.223
[muffled] Lucy?! Lucy!

37:05.306 --> 37:07.058
[muffled] 10K!

37:10.729 --> 37:13.690
[Murphy] Lucy! Lucy.

37:14.816 --> 37:18.611
[audio returning to normal]
Are you okay? Are you okay?

37:19.988 --> 37:21.531
[Doc] 10K!

37:28.329 --> 37:29.497
[coughs]

37:37.172 --> 37:40.467
Everybody okay?
Everybody, follow me.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.138
I found something. This way.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.684
[Murphy] So this is the antenna
you saw in your dream?

38:31.768 --> 38:33.561
Yes.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.356
But I'm not sure it's a dream.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.108
The ol' "woke up from a coma,
and now I'm psychic" thing? Oh.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.944
I don't think it's that either.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.906
Warren's right. You can see the highway
headed East straight that way.

38:47.909 --> 38:50.203
-You got anything on that radio?
-Nothing military.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.832
Not even Zona traffic. Just some...

38:53.915 --> 38:56.459
ghost station I can't quite tune in.
Hang on.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.045
-Wait, wait. Go back, go back.
-[distorted voice]

38:59.128 --> 39:01.297
I got something.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.049
[woman] <i>This is Northern Light.
Say hi to Dada.</i>

39:05.260 --> 39:06.302
[child] <i>Dada, hi.</i>

39:07.720 --> 39:10.682
-[woman] <i>Citizen Z, we're calling...-Did she just say Citizen Z?</i>

39:10.765 --> 39:12.725
Is he still alive?

39:12.809 --> 39:13.977
[child] <i>Dada, come home!</i>

39:16.729 --> 39:18.898
What happened to the poor dude?
Did he get brain damage?

39:18.982 --> 39:21.818
-No, man. That's Kaya and her baby!
-[woman] <i>Citizen Z, we're calling...</i>

39:21.901 --> 39:24.112
Wait, you guys know Citizen Z?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.030
[child] <i>Like a puppy.</i>

39:26.114 --> 39:28.491
Kaya. Kaya. It's Operation Bite Mark.

39:28.575 --> 39:30.577
Repeat. Operation Bite Mark. Come in.

39:30.660 --> 39:34.163
[woman]<i>Your family is waiting for you,
Simon, we always will be.</i>

39:35.999 --> 39:37.792
<i>This is Kaya in the Sky-A signing off.</i>

39:37.876 --> 39:39.627
[child babbles]

39:39.878 --> 39:41.379
[transmission ends]

39:47.260 --> 39:49.721
Well, at least we know she's alive
and okay.

39:51.681 --> 39:55.184
-What about Citizen Z?
-Nothing worse than not knowing.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.314
-[metal clangs, rat squeals]
-Rats!

40:01.816 --> 40:02.817
-[stone lands]
-[man] Ow!

40:03.860 --> 40:05.445
Did that Z rat just say "ow"?

40:13.286 --> 40:14.704
Wait a minute.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.416
[Doc] Huh.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.002
It's just an Ender?

40:21.085 --> 40:23.254
[Murphy] With a rat puppet?

40:23.338 --> 40:24.422
Rats.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.761
We got about two minutes
before Mick Rat here turns into Mad Z.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.262
I'd say let's beat it.

40:42.649 --> 40:44.150
Oh... let's never do that again.

40:46.736 --> 40:47.862
What now, Chief?

40:50.365 --> 40:53.785
Well, there's still time
for you guys to get to Newmerica.

40:53.868 --> 40:56.120
-Finally.
-Without you?

41:00.333 --> 41:02.335
Yeah, I'm going East.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.712
Doesn't feel
like I have much of a choice.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.215
-But you do.
-Yeah, I don't know.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.468
You know,
I do hate it when we split up.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.265
-I go where you go.
-Me too.

41:16.349 --> 41:18.434
Well, if you're going, I'm going.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.481
I don't know what's going on
in that head of yours,

41:24.357 --> 41:26.025
but I'm gonna throw a little faith
your way.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.236
For now.

41:30.363 --> 41:31.531
Lieutenant.

41:32.615 --> 41:33.950
Puppies and kittens.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.452
[Doc] I bet those berries
on Zona were canned.

41:36.536 --> 41:38.162
Made the waffles all soggy.

41:38.246 --> 41:42.166
[Murphy] Nope, fresh daily!
Ripe as hell with powdered sugar!

41:42.375 --> 41:43.668
[Doc] Damn it.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.503
[snarling]
