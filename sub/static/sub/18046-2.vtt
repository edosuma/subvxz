00:11.386 --> 00:14.097
Why do I think I'm ready for the Process?

00:15.724 --> 00:20.229
Well, I'm smart, I can do math.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.940
I can recite the alphabet backwards.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.443
I can draw well, I know carpentry,

00:26.526 --> 00:28.946
and I'm ready for the Offshore, I swear.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.156
You're very good, Fernando.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.785
But I dare you to guess
what number I'm thinking.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.790
Most people guess five or seven.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.667
You look like someone who would pick five.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.669
Do you really believe that?

00:45.921 --> 00:48.006
Congratulations! That is correct.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.967
Now you can go to the Offshore.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.429
I passed! I passed!
I'm going to the Offshore!

00:54.972 --> 00:56.890
I'm going! Finally!

00:56.974 --> 01:01.436
I passed! I'm going to the Offshore!

01:01.520 --> 01:03.230
I passed! I passed!

<i>To remain in the Process,</i>

<i>Candidate, follow directions</i>

01:57.743 --> 01:58.827
Do you have a problem?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.788
No, no. It's just...

02:03.498 --> 02:06.251
You're the one who made
the cube out of cubes, right?

02:06.335 --> 02:08.753
Yeah. How did you hear about that?

02:08.836 --> 02:11.298
People are talking about
"the guy who saved the girl."

02:12.424 --> 02:15.552
"The cripple is a genius!
He made a cube out of cubes."

02:16.094 --> 02:18.847
-Congratulations, man, you're famous!
-Thanks.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.978
<i>That's my cube! What the hell?</i>

02:25.062 --> 02:27.314
This is the kind of person
he's letting through.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.525
He says it's to fight the Cause,
but it's destroying our side.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.611
<i>This video is not enough.</i>

02:33.153 --> 02:35.030
But he almost drowned an agent.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.657
<i>Those are not crimes, Aline.</i>

02:36.740 --> 02:38.617
<i>To overthrow Ezequiel,</i>

02:38.700 --> 02:41.244
<i>you have to find something</i>

02:41.328 --> 02:42.496
<i>Understood?</i>

02:46.166 --> 02:49.670
<i>Candidate, follow directions</i>
<i>to your next test.</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:56.426
I just want to make sure there's
no misunderstanding between us.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.847
No. Everything is quite clear.

03:00.972 --> 03:04.434
<i>Candidate, follow directions</i>
<i>to your next test.</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:07.562
She seemed cool.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.190
I'm telling you,
that girl is with the Cause.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.275
-No way.
-She's with the Cause.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.028
-You guys really think so?
-No way, she's cool.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.572
Dude, listen to me. She's with the Cause.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.783
Michele, you know her, don't you?

03:19.866 --> 03:22.119
-Who?
-Bruna.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.371
-She went missing.
-Do you know where she is?

03:24.454 --> 03:26.790
She was probably eliminated. That's all.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.584
-Yeah, I think she was.
-No, I saw her after the cube test.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.129
If she is with the Cause,
I hope she's dead.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.422
I don't get those people.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.174
-They're a bunch of fuckers.
-They're ungrateful.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.636
The Offshore offers salvation for everyone
and they despise it.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.431
It's absurd.

03:43.807 --> 03:47.269
<i>Candidate, follow directions</i>
<i>to your next test.</i>

03:52.149 --> 03:54.985
I saw the agent taking you
and Bruna away.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.116
If you want to talk later, I'll be here.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.191
-Fernando?
-Yeah.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.233
Come with me.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.070
They're taking him.

A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

05:44.302 --> 05:46.304
CHAPTER 02
COINS

05:56.606 --> 05:57.816
Do you feel anything?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.943
From here on up.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.696
Lie on your stomach.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.228
-Do you feel anything?
-A lot of pain in my back.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.438
And now?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.565
I said I don't feel anything.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.567
And now?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.243
The effect will only last a few minutes.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.370
But our medicine is advanced.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.332
With the full treatment,
you could walk again.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.586
But first, you have to pass.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.057
Hey. You guys, too?

07:13.099 --> 07:15.685
I was told to come to room four.
This is it.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.146
-Yes, that's it.
-Is this the guy?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.148
I love you, too, man.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.901
Well, if it's a cheating test, we're set.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.239
Fernando, how did your exam go?

07:28.323 --> 07:30.700
-I'll tell you later.
-You can go in.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.062
Whoa.

08:00.897 --> 08:04.067
Do you think all the houses
on the Offshore are like this?

08:07.904 --> 08:08.780
Candidates.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.036
What happened to the woman in navy blue?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.831
Analyze the scene and find out.

08:18.540 --> 08:22.669
When you've come to a conclusion,
press the button and state your answer.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.051
I think she choked, right?

08:30.677 --> 08:34.097
Wow, you figured that out all by yourself?
Congratulations.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.058
Shut up, Rafael.

08:45.025 --> 08:49.612
<i>Room 7: Francisco, Gabriel,</i>
<i>Ana, Oswaldo, Clara,</i>

08:49.696 --> 08:51.656
<i>Wagner, Mariana, and Pedro.</i>

08:51.740 --> 08:53.491
<i>You've all been eliminated.</i>

08:53.575 --> 08:55.160
I guess they had the wrong answer.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.121
The answer is here,
we just need to look carefully.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.340
They have vaccine scars.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.051
They are definitely from the Offshore.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.526
Fuck. How are we gonna solve this shit?

09:42.499 --> 09:45.460
More than half the candidates
are eliminated in this test.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.461
Really?

09:46.544 --> 09:49.756
So, most candidates
lack basic deduction capabilities?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.508
No, induction.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.970
To go from a collective
to a single perspective is deduction.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.516
From the single to the collective
is induction.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.062
Do they know they're being monitored?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.567
They should know, but they don't.

10:19.035 --> 10:19.869
MAY 31
FOUNDERS' FESTIVAL

10:19.953 --> 10:22.413
The 31st is the Founders' Festival.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.748
What's this?

10:30.755 --> 10:31.714
This is horrible.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.342
This rug...

10:35.343 --> 10:37.220
I thought they had good taste
on the Offshore.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.699
-Sorry, guys. My bad.
-You broke it, you idiot!

10:57.782 --> 10:59.826
Careful! Every detail
could be part of the solution.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.828
If that's the solution, we just failed.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.037
I said I was sorry.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.455
Guys, calm down.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.791
It's not Teo's fault. He was born stupid.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.084
Go fuck yourself.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.588
Just leave it, Marco.

11:12.589 --> 11:16.050
-Giving up?
-I'm not getting yelled at. Fuck that.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.724
Room 9: Cecília, Beatriz, Eduardo,
Vítor, Caio, Helena, and Artur.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.850
<i>You've been eliminated.</i>

11:29.814 --> 11:32.483
Are you okay, Fernando? What's wrong?

11:33.985 --> 11:35.361
Stop, Ágata!

11:36.696 --> 11:38.323
I wanted to see
what kind of meat it was.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.366
-I already said not to touch it.
-It's best we don't.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.659
I just wanted to try it.

11:41.743 --> 11:46.039
-If it tastes different, I want to--
-Don't touch that food! Trust me.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.458
I know what happened here.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.006
She was poisoned.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.218
By the hostess.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.888
Hold on. The hostess?

12:02.221 --> 12:03.932
-This one?
-Exactly.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.059
It's two couples.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.520
One are the hosts, the other are guests.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.606
-How do you know?
-Two things.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.483
Their rings and their shoes.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.986
The woman in blue and her husband's
shoes are dirty with mud.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.657
They don't live here,
they just came for dinner.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
Wait, you said she was poisoned.

12:22.825 --> 12:23.701
Pay attention.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.788
Both men are getting up
to help the woman in blue.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.665
But she's only staring at one man.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.249
This one.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.961
She's reaching for his hand.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.546
When you're desperate,
it's natural to reach out

12:35.630 --> 12:38.049
to the person who's closest to you.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.134
But in this case, it's not her husband.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.303
It's her lover.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.599
They're having an affair.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.142
The hostess found out...

12:48.685 --> 12:52.313
and poisoned the other woman's food
out of revenge.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.568
Yeah... only the woman in blue
had sauce on her plate.

12:59.195 --> 13:03.116
Exactly. That's where the hostess
put all the poison.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.243
So that's what was on her desk.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.704
This is probably the formula
for the poison.

13:07.787 --> 13:08.913
It makes perfect sense.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.875
Just take a close look
at the hostess' facial expression.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.045
Look at her, she looks like a murderer.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.798
While the two men are getting up
to help the other woman,

13:18.881 --> 13:22.677
she avoids looking directly
at the woman who's suffering.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.430
That's it.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.102
Fuck, Mr. Wheels.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.022
And I thought the cube
made out of cubes was genius.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.649
Yes.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.069
You killed it, man.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.364
Good one. We didn't have to do anything.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.618
I guess everyone agrees, right?
I'm gonna press the button.

13:47.702 --> 13:48.870
No. Wait!

13:49.954 --> 13:51.164
Wait for what, Rafael?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.629
-That answer is completely wrong.
-What?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.381
Here we go, Rafael.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.010
Do you really think
the Process would show us a scene

14:04.093 --> 14:07.138
of adultery and murder
that happened on the Offshore?

14:08.931 --> 14:10.058
You're all idiots.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.852
-Do you have a better idea, genius?
-Sure.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.730
She wasn't poisoned.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.108
She's allergic to silver.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.026
What?

14:20.610 --> 14:21.611
What do you mean?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.821
-Allergic to silver?
-Right.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.367
Everyone at the table has a metal object.

14:27.450 --> 14:31.079
All three are wearing watches.
A metal necklace.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.956
Everyone except for her.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.127
Even her ring is made of glass
or something.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.381
Her necklace is made of wood.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.383
She's wearing a ring made of wood.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.636
But not the silverware.
They're made of silver.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.931
She didn't notice and started eating.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.809
And now her allergies
are blocking her airway.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.480
But only the woman in blue had sauce.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.567
So what? Maybe she's the only one
who likes sauce.

15:01.651 --> 15:02.777
What's wrong with that?

15:03.528 --> 15:05.113
And that's not even true.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.324
Look at the hostess' napkin.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.286
-Holy shit.
-Check it out.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.290
I don't think she'd eat her own poison.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.254
There's your guy.

15:21.712 --> 15:22.672
My guy?

15:23.923 --> 15:27.885
You allowed him to pass the cube test
in quite an unorthodox way.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.305
And you think I'm protecting him?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.976
No, I'm just kidding.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.694
Then why is she staring at the other
woman's husband and not her own?

15:44.777 --> 15:48.489
That's easy. In fact, you should've
figured that out on your own.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.577
He's a doctor.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.457
Those formulas over there
aren't for poison.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.333
They're medical formulas or something.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.429
All right, he might be a doctor,
but the woman in blue is dying

16:11.512 --> 16:14.140
and the hostess is right there,
not worried at all.

16:14.223 --> 16:18.728
If she didn't poison her on purpose,
how do you explain that, Rafael?

16:19.896 --> 16:21.022
She's blind.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.823
That's why she's not looking
at the woman who's choking.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.162
She really is blind.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.665
Let me see that, Marco.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.211
Not everyone would assume
there are people with special needs

16:43.294 --> 16:44.670
on the Offshore.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.928
How did you know that, Joana?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.306
His desk has a lamp on it.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.432
Hers doesn't.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.027
That, my friends, is how you solve a case.

17:08.611 --> 17:09.694
Without any sauce.

17:14.951 --> 17:15.785
Hello.

17:16.327 --> 17:20.080
The woman in blue is choking
because she's allergic to silver.

17:20.748 --> 17:25.044
The hostess is blind.
Her husband is a doctor.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.465
And this rug is hideous.

17:34.262 --> 17:37.014
Does anyone in the group
have a different theory?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.237
No, it's unanimous.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.327
<i>Your answer is correct.</i>

18:01.330 --> 18:03.833
<i>But that doesn't mean</i>
<i>everyone made it through.</i>

18:23.019 --> 18:25.354
Candidate Teo, you've been eliminated.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.189
What? What are you talking about?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.442
-Follow me, please.
-What? We got it right.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.777
I passed, too! He's the one
who came up with the wrong answer.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.113
He did, but he also helped the group.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.365
-You did nothing.
-I did.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.076
I examined everything.
Just because I broke something?

18:39.160 --> 18:42.163
What did you all do?
Do you think this is fair?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.914
The Process is supposed to be fair.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.417
<i>The guidelines to overcoming</i>
<i>the trauma of elimination</i>

18:46.500 --> 18:48.377
<i>will be given to you</i>
<i>when you return your uniform.</i>

18:48.461 --> 18:49.587
Fuck all of you.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.464
<i>We thank you for your participation.</i>

18:59.263 --> 19:01.223
<i>So? What did you think?</i>

19:02.058 --> 19:04.435
-I would have done well on this test.
-I agree.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.229
Aline, I'd like to ask a favor.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.565
The incident with the mole
from the Cause

19:09.649 --> 19:11.609
has delayed our schedule.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.071
We're behind on tomorrow's tests.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.866
I was wondering if you could monitor
the next test with Álvaro.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.493
-Sure.
-Is that okay?

19:20.576 --> 19:21.452
No worries.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.038
Monitoring will be done from here, okay?

19:44.558 --> 19:46.143
Let me give you a hand.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.395
It's stuck.

19:48.771 --> 19:49.980
Give it to me.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.526
Told you.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.404
I told you.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.626
What's up?

20:11.085 --> 20:12.712
No need to thank me.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.424
I know I saved everyone, even you,
from your brilliant idea.

20:20.803 --> 20:21.971
-Thanks.
-It worked.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.852
But it was a great story.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.313
The sauce, the betrayed woman,
the murderer...

20:31.856 --> 20:33.482
But that's okay. That's what I'm here for.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.485
Fuck you, Rafael.

20:37.027 --> 20:37.903
I'm serious.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.281
This time it was me.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.991
Maybe next time, it'll be you.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.620
I mean, I wouldn't bet on it.
But who knows?

20:53.169 --> 20:54.962
-Makes you thirsty, huh?
-Very.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.634
Good thing we did well on this test.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.471
-It was a hard one.
-Yeah.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.650
Well... I'm gonna go.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.527
Later.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.495
Hey.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.540
That was a close one, huh?

21:32.082 --> 21:34.210
Good thing we were in a smart group.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.299
I'm soaked. I was helping a girl
with her water bottle.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.653
Are you coming or what?

22:45.864 --> 22:46.699
Are you okay?

22:48.492 --> 22:49.868
I'd like to be alone.

22:51.954 --> 22:56.083
Sometimes when we wanna be alone,
all we really need is someone to talk to.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.422
I could walk again.

23:03.674 --> 23:04.508
What?

23:05.259 --> 23:07.595
-I don't know. Maybe.
-What did you say?

23:07.678 --> 23:11.682
The doctor tested a treatment
from the Offshore and I felt my legs.

23:11.765 --> 23:15.603
I can't believe it, Fernando.
That's incredible. It's wonderful.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.981
-You can walk again--
-Michele, why are you so happy?

23:20.691 --> 23:23.777
It took me years to accept
that I would never walk again.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.112
But I did it.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.407
I've spent my entire life
in this wheelchair.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.783
This is who I am.

23:30.701 --> 23:32.953
And now they tell me
that everything can change?

23:33.037 --> 23:34.288
That I don't have to be myself?

23:34.371 --> 23:38.208
That all the effort I've put in up to now
was for nothing?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.462
Fuck walking, Michele.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.505
That's not why I came to the Process.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.425
I came here because I can pass.
End of story.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.811
...already did the qualifications.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.814
Ezequiel also asked us to run
the analysis of group K.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.245
Álvaro, how long until the next test?

24:15.329 --> 24:16.330
About five minutes.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.333
I'll go freshen up. Be right back.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.250
Okay.

25:28.777 --> 25:29.862
What's this?

25:36.243 --> 25:37.119
Candidates...

25:39.163 --> 25:40.706
this test is simple.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.960
You have 15 minutes to decide
which one of you should be eliminated.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.088
There are a total of six coins
for seven of you.

25:48.172 --> 25:51.550
When the time is up, only those holding
a coin will make it through.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.595
After 15 minutes,
if you haven't come to a decision,

25:54.678 --> 25:56.555
you will all be eliminated.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.265
How do we base our decision?

25:58.348 --> 25:59.892
However you want.

25:59.975 --> 26:03.228
The remaining candidates
will take the next test as a group.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.229
So choose wisely.

26:04.855 --> 26:05.689
Good luck.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.915
How are we gonna decide?

26:22.998 --> 26:24.208
How are you gonna decide?

26:25.292 --> 26:26.126
I'm in.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.504
No way. No one is in.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.548
-Return the coins, Rafael.
-Why the fuck would I do that?

26:31.632 --> 26:33.884
Because it's not fair.
We have to choose the criteria together.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.637
-You can't just take a coin.
-I think it's very fair.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.972
The test is to take a coin. I took it.

26:39.056 --> 26:41.683
You took three coins,
you motherfucker. I saw you.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.352
Yes, that's true.

26:44.019 --> 26:44.853
Here.

26:46.396 --> 26:50.275
There. You can fight for those.
But not for mine. Mine is right here.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.860
Rafael, stop being ridiculous.

26:51.944 --> 26:55.405
-How old are you, two?
-You think this is about who's first?

26:55.489 --> 26:57.991
I do. Come on, guys.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.952
Where did you grow up?

27:03.372 --> 27:05.582
Where I grew up,
we'd just take that from you.

27:06.834 --> 27:07.876
Oh, yeah?

27:08.335 --> 27:09.378
I'm waiting.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.635
Let go. Let go!

27:20.013 --> 27:21.056
Let go.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.308
Let go.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.071
What was that for, Marco?

27:36.154 --> 27:38.448
All you had to do was ask nicely.

27:44.705 --> 27:45.539
Go on, Joana.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.085
There.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.130
Now we decide who goes.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.668
Unrestricted access. Councilor Matheus.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.932
User Ezequiel. Last camera modifications.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.189
View camera.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.900
<i>Camera 5970. Live.</i>

28:59.696 --> 29:00.530
What?

29:03.116 --> 29:03.951
Reset.

29:19.633 --> 29:23.804
-Next.
<i>-Camera 5971. Live.</i>

29:24.721 --> 29:25.555
Reset.

29:29.851 --> 29:30.686
Ezequiel?

29:46.201 --> 29:47.035
Reset.

29:54.918 --> 29:58.088
<i>Candidates, you have</i>
<i>ten minutes remaining.</i>

29:58.797 --> 30:00.048
I vote for Rafael.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.134
I'm so shocked.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.427
It's the obvious choice.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.637
You walked in and took the coins.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.597
On the cubes test, you cheated.

30:07.681 --> 30:10.809
In other words,
you shouldn't even be here.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.061
You're all forgetting one thing.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.315
If it weren't for me,
none of you would be here.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.944
So bash me all you want.
Be pissed off at me.

30:21.028 --> 30:23.363
Just don't forget
that the next test is a group test.

30:24.614 --> 30:25.449
So?

30:25.907 --> 30:28.118
You really want to go in without me?

30:30.662 --> 30:31.496
Fernando.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.291
I vote...

30:36.835 --> 30:37.669
for Joana.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.465
-Why?
-I despise Rafael.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.134
-Thanks.
-But Joana doesn't seem to care.

30:44.217 --> 30:48.263
Everyone is putting in all this work
and she's just standing there.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.433
Sorry, but if you don't believe
in the Process,

30:51.516 --> 30:53.143
-you don't deserve to be here.
-Wait.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.270
-Right in front of her.
-Why is he doing this?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.188
Damn.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.113
As usual, you're wrong.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.200
Joana is worth much more
than a lot of you combined.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.951
-Why are you defending her?
-You knew her before.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.745
-No, no.
-You're together.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.498
Of course not!
I'm sticking up for the group, not her.

31:14.581 --> 31:17.918
I want Joana in our group
on the next test.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.545
-It's simple.
-Are you sure that's all?

31:22.172 --> 31:24.132
There's one thing here
everyone can see.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.468
But no one has the guts to say it.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.472
I vote for Fernando.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.352
And it's not even because you almost
got us all eliminated.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.770
It's because of the...

31:38.897 --> 31:41.149
-the obvious reason.
-What?

31:44.778 --> 31:46.863
You're sitting on it, Fernando.

31:48.740 --> 31:52.202
You have no chance of finishing
the Process in that chair.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.578
Shut up, Rafael.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.539
We just saw a blind woman on the Offshore.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.541
-That's no reason to--
-We saw a doll.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.003
Besides, she might have become blind
after the Process.

32:02.087 --> 32:05.674
Or do you believe a blind person
could pass these tests?

32:05.757 --> 32:07.926
What if the next test is physical?

32:08.009 --> 32:09.261
What happens to our group?

32:13.473 --> 32:16.184
Fernando, you're going to be eliminated.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.146
I'm sorry to say it, but you are,
sooner or later.

32:19.229 --> 32:20.063
No.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.358
The Process will see beyond that.
They'll see that I can do it.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.069
I know you believe that.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.781
That you need to believe it.
It's a beautiful story, man.

32:30.532 --> 32:31.741
But it's not true.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.705
And it's completely unfair
if everyone here is in jeopardy

32:36.788 --> 32:38.707
so you can stay in the Process
a little longer.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.167
You're not gonna say anything?

32:41.084 --> 32:42.878
Even he knows I'm right.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.802
Does anyone have anything else to say?

32:59.728 --> 33:01.438
Amen!

33:01.521 --> 33:05.442
Because the Process is more
than just a selection.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.402
Much more.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.364
The Offshore offers salvation.

33:12.365 --> 33:15.118
And the Process is purification.

33:15.994 --> 33:21.958
Because life on the Offshore
is just, true, superior.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.043
YOU DESERVE IT

33:23.126 --> 33:26.880
But in order to be deserving of it,
you must believe.

33:26.963 --> 33:29.549
Have faith in the Founding Couple.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.384
Have faith in the Process.

33:31.468 --> 33:36.014
And above all things,
have faith in yourselves.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.728
Now, let's close our eyes and picture...

33:42.896 --> 33:46.483
picture yourselves going to the Offshore.

33:54.115 --> 33:54.950
Son...

34:10.632 --> 34:11.716
There we go.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.762
There. Try it out.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.389
No.

34:18.014 --> 34:18.974
This life sucks.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.850
Hey! Fernando!

34:20.934 --> 34:24.187
You're gonna start feeling sorry
for yourself now?

34:25.063 --> 34:26.356
Fernando, look at me.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.317
What's the most important thing in life?

34:29.400 --> 34:32.404
-Making it through the Process.
-Exactly!

34:32.487 --> 34:35.322
And the Process doesn't care
if you're in a wheelchair,

34:35.407 --> 34:38.284
or if you came flying or jumping.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.036
You must have faith in the Process.

34:42.914 --> 34:46.668
Son, this chair makes you stronger.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.335
It's your secret weapon.

34:57.512 --> 35:01.141
<i>Candidates, you have</i>
<i>five minutes remaining.</i>

35:01.891 --> 35:03.685
I guess we're ready to vote.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.688
-Who thinks that Fernando--?
-I want to talk.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.694
Do you know why I took so long
at the physical today?

35:14.029 --> 35:15.614
They gave me a shot.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.452
A treatment from the Offshore,
and I could feel my legs.

35:23.246 --> 35:27.375
The doctor said that if I make it through
to the Offshore, I will walk again.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.171
Do you know what that means?

35:32.881 --> 35:36.259
And the doctor believes I can last
the entire Process.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.432
So, please, guys...

35:45.644 --> 35:47.354
don't take that away from me.

35:54.569 --> 35:55.945
Fernando is right.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.032
We barely know one another.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.035
And it's not fair to judge each other.

36:03.370 --> 36:06.539
-Even if that person is Rafael.
-So, what do we do?

36:07.207 --> 36:08.500
We have to vote someone out.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.794
-We draw names.
-Draw names?

36:10.877 --> 36:12.003
All this to draw names?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.088
-It's fair.
-Fair?

36:13.171 --> 36:16.007
-Let luck decide.
-So, you're off the hook. Right?

36:16.091 --> 36:17.175
I'm in.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.636
I don't want to eliminate anyone.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.682
You know what you are? Cowards.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.018
-Drawing names sounds good.
-Yeah.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.104
-Ágata, can I have your scarf?
-What?

36:29.646 --> 36:30.480
Please.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.778
<i>Candidates, you have </i>
<i>three minutes remaining.</i>

36:46.329 --> 36:48.331
The most important moment of our lives

36:48.415 --> 36:50.542
decided by a fucking torn-up scarf.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.210
That's great! Just great!

36:54.671 --> 36:56.673
<i>You have two minutes remaining.</i>

36:57.173 --> 37:00.552
Whoever picks the shortest strip
is eliminated.

37:02.637 --> 37:03.471
Lucas.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.603
I passed! Goddamn!

37:19.612 --> 37:21.531
<i>You have one minute remaining.</i>

37:30.415 --> 37:31.249
Rafael.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.887
Great idea on the draw. Awesome.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.598
Joana.

37:56.566 --> 38:02.614
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>

38:03.531 --> 38:07.952
<i>six, five, four...</i>

38:08.661 --> 38:09.579
-That's it.
<i>-...three...</i>

38:09.662 --> 38:12.916
-That's it.
<i>-...two, one.</i>

38:20.340 --> 38:22.509
-Have you made a decision?
-Yes.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.532
Good luck on the Inland.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.329
What?

38:52.247 --> 38:53.623
Fuck, where's the coin?

38:57.043 --> 38:57.961
Where's the coin?

38:58.920 --> 39:01.840
Where's the coin?
Hold on, she stole it! She has the coin!

39:01.923 --> 39:03.925
Hold up, Joana! Tell him we drew names!

39:04.008 --> 39:06.344
Joana! Get back here, you motherfucker!

39:06.427 --> 39:08.721
Hold on! She has the coin! We drew names!

39:08.805 --> 39:12.100
Joana, tell him we drew names!

39:12.183 --> 39:13.434
Motherfucker!

39:13.518 --> 39:14.686
Shit!

39:35.248 --> 39:39.127
<i>Instructions for your recovery include:</i>

39:39.419 --> 39:41.379
<i>-Try to not reminisce...</i>
-952.

39:41.462 --> 39:44.132
<i>...or comment on the events</i>
<i>of the Process.</i>

39:44.215 --> 39:47.010
<i>Memories can be very painful.</i>

39:47.927 --> 39:49.762
<i>The joy of having children</i>

39:49.846 --> 39:54.183
<i>is one of the most efficient methods</i>
<i>to deal with frustration.</i>

40:03.902 --> 40:05.570
What's with the faces?

40:07.113 --> 40:10.241
What? It doesn't even look
like you passed.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.035
-Be quiet.
-What?

40:12.118 --> 40:13.202
Shut up.

40:13.286 --> 40:16.497
You know what this is?
People who can't enjoy life.

40:16.581 --> 40:19.500
What can you do, right, Fernando?
What can you do?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.712
Is there any food around here?

40:22.795 --> 40:25.256
-These tests make me hungry.
-What...?

40:32.388 --> 40:35.224
-Where's Lucas?
-He didn't have a coin.

40:48.613 --> 40:49.656
Relax.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.199
You tried.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.538
Reset.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.762
What are you hiding, Ezequiel?

41:13.513 --> 41:17.225
-Next.
<i>-Camera 5986. Live.</i>

41:24.607 --> 41:25.441
Next.

41:27.986 --> 41:28.987
Next.

41:33.491 --> 41:38.121
-Next.
<i>-Camera 5977. Live.</i>

41:46.963 --> 41:47.880
Reset.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.218
Hey, what's up?

42:34.302 --> 42:37.555
This damn chair is stuck again.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.974
Easy! You passed.
Isn't that what you wanted?

42:40.058 --> 42:43.311
Sure! I wanted the pity vote
after a pathetic speech

42:43.394 --> 42:44.604
in front of everyone.

42:44.687 --> 42:47.899
"Oh, I really wanna walk again!"
Come on, Michele.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.234
That's exactly what I didn't want.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.570
Since I was a kid,
I've been telling myself:

42:52.653 --> 42:55.323
"I'm going to pass, I can pass.
I'm good enough."

42:56.157 --> 42:58.826
Everyone doubted me, Michele.

43:00.995 --> 43:01.829
But then...

43:07.376 --> 43:08.461
But then, what?

43:09.003 --> 43:10.379
What if he's right?

43:11.672 --> 43:12.882
Who are you talking about?

43:16.636 --> 43:17.762
Everyone.

43:18.679 --> 43:20.681
I had to rely on Rafael earlier.

43:21.724 --> 43:24.519
I had to rely on everyone's pity today.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.774
I don't know how much further I can go.

43:29.857 --> 43:32.568
Come on, Fernando.
Of course you're gonna go far.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.613
You're not pitiful. You're strong.

43:37.573 --> 43:38.866
It's not your fault.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.743
This place is to blame.

43:40.827 --> 43:42.578
They make us do horrible things in here.

43:42.662 --> 43:44.539
Michele, what are you talking about?

43:44.622 --> 43:46.541
-The Process is not to blame.
-Then who is?

43:46.624 --> 43:47.458
I am!

43:48.918 --> 43:51.087
-I was weak.
-You had vision.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.173
You did what you had to do.
You used their pity to pass.

43:54.715 --> 43:57.093
The people who made you do it
are the ones to blame.

44:04.392 --> 44:05.852
I get it.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.605
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

44:11.566 --> 44:13.234
I can tell.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.199
Shut up.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.970
Hello, Ezequiel.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.431
How was the coin test?

44:43.514 --> 44:45.308
It went well.

44:45.391 --> 44:47.977
-Were you able to plan tomorrow's test?
-Yes.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.937
We're back on schedule.

44:50.980 --> 44:51.939
Excellent.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.040
FACIAL RECOGNITION 100%
NO MATCH

45:09.123 --> 45:10.833
<i>I checked all the files.</i>

45:10.917 --> 45:14.128
He heads out regularly to the Inland,
once a week,

45:14.211 --> 45:17.173
and he erases the security footage.
He edits the images.

45:18.883 --> 45:21.010
<i>Good, Aline. That's the way!</i>

45:21.719 --> 45:24.055
<i>You need to send me all those images.</i>

45:24.138 --> 45:27.308
I will. But his face is never visible.
What can we do?

45:27.391 --> 45:29.143
<i>We need proof.</i>

45:29.894 --> 45:33.689
<i>You need to find out</i>
<i>what Ezequiel is hiding.</i>

45:37.735 --> 45:38.945
Right.
