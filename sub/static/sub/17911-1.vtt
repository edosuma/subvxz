00:01.300 --> 00:03.900
(bright music)

00:08.067 --> 00:09.233
(car alarm chirps)

00:09.233 --> 00:12.100
("Comin' Home
Baby" by Mel Torme)

00:12.100 --> 00:13.200
* Come on home

00:13.200 --> 00:14.700
* Come one home baby now

00:14.700 --> 00:16.133
* You know I'm
waiting here for you *

00:16.133 --> 00:18.800
* I'm coming home
now real soon *

00:18.800 --> 00:19.900
* You been gone

00:19.900 --> 00:21.300
* Coming home baby now

00:21.300 --> 00:22.733
* You don't know
what I'm gonna do *

00:22.733 --> 00:25.300
* I'm coming home I
know I'm overdue *

00:25.300 --> 00:26.500
* Since you went away

00:26.500 --> 00:29.167
* Expect me any
day now real soon *

00:29.167 --> 00:32.000
* I'm coming home and
never more to roam *

00:32.000 --> 00:33.300
* Baby tell me you're

00:33.300 --> 00:38.200
* Baby I'm for
sure coming home *

00:39.000 --> 00:39.733
* I'm coming home

00:39.733 --> 00:40.567
* Come on home

00:40.567 --> 00:43.500
(platform whirring)

00:44.767 --> 00:46.733
- [Oscar] Bye-bye, house.

00:46.733 --> 00:49.200
- Bye-by, tiny,
tiny kid's bedroom.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.867
- We're really leaving.

00:51.867 --> 00:53.267
- It's gonna be great.

00:53.267 --> 00:55.300
- Never thought this
day would actually come.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.400
- Me either.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.667
I've loved this house.

00:57.667 --> 00:58.633
- Good times.

00:58.633 --> 01:00.067
- Yeah, no, no, not the noodles.

01:00.067 --> 01:01.200
Honestly, you guys
have done enough.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.700
- So many memories.

01:02.700 --> 01:03.633
- Yeah.

01:03.633 --> 01:04.567
Anyway, we've got it from here.

01:04.567 --> 01:06.367
- [Wayne] We'll really miss it.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.967
- I won't miss the cleaning!

01:08.967 --> 01:11.833
I thought I taught
you to outsource!

01:11.833 --> 01:13.400
- Well, no one asked
you to help us clean.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.933
In fact, no one asked
you to help us move.

01:14.933 --> 01:16.400
- What?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.733
Let some removalist fleece
you 80 bucks an hour all day?

01:18.733 --> 01:20.267
No offense, George.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.267
We're happy to help.

01:21.267 --> 01:22.767
- Speak for yourself.

01:22.767 --> 01:23.833
Do I look happy?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.233
- You never look happy, Mum.

01:25.233 --> 01:26.800
- I don't look happy
because I slave my guts out

01:26.800 --> 01:29.200
moving a truckload of
mid-century bullshit!

01:29.200 --> 01:30.700
- Again, no one
asked you to help!

01:30.700 --> 01:32.467
- While Brianna's
allowed to go AWOL.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.900
(winces) Where is she now?

01:34.900 --> 01:38.067
- Hi, I'm Brianna and this
is my partner, Younis.

01:38.067 --> 01:39.300
- Hi.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.500
- We've been dating for
five and a half months.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.067
- But it was after
five and a half minutes

01:42.067 --> 01:43.900
that I knew Brianna and I were
gonna be together forever.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.133
- Aw, babe!

01:45.133 --> 01:46.400
As you can see, we're
both totally into

01:46.400 --> 01:47.967
fitness and bodybuilding,

01:47.967 --> 01:49.833
but that's not the only type
of building that we're into.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.067
- [Amber] Oi!

01:51.067 --> 01:52.300
- We're in the
middle of filming!

01:52.300 --> 01:53.833
- We're in the
middle of working!

01:53.833 --> 01:55.867
- Come on, Brianna, we're
going to the new house.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.233
- Soon.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.167
In a little while.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.233
- Lactic acid, babe.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.233
- You keep filming!

02:00.233 --> 02:01.367
We can wait!

02:01.367 --> 02:02.567
(Brianna crashes)

02:02.567 --> 02:04.133
- Argh!

02:04.133 --> 02:05.967
Say sorry to Younis, Amber!

02:05.967 --> 02:07.800
- (scoffs) I'm not waiting.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.733
I've got to get
Shawn to footy soon.

02:08.733 --> 02:10.233
I'll see you at the new house.

02:11.667 --> 02:12.500
(tires screech)

02:12.500 --> 02:15.333
(furniture thuds)

02:16.267 --> 02:17.800
- Oh, the new house.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.600
(Dan scoffs)

02:19.600 --> 02:22.100
Isn't it funny to say
it out loud like that?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.300
The new house.

02:24.633 --> 02:25.467
Oh!

02:25.467 --> 02:26.700
Hey, kids!

02:26.700 --> 02:28.067
What about one last
game of badminton?

02:28.067 --> 02:29.300
- No.

02:29.300 --> 02:29.967
Come on, Bessie, get
in the car, please.

02:29.967 --> 02:30.833
We gotta go.

02:30.833 --> 02:31.767
- Hey!

02:31.767 --> 02:33.900
I know what we've forgotten.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.267
We need to scratch our
name in the concrete.

02:36.267 --> 02:37.867
To say we were here.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.733
- It would need to be wet.

02:39.733 --> 02:40.967
- Wayne?

02:40.967 --> 02:42.800
Could you get us
some wet concrete?

02:42.800 --> 02:44.567
- You know this is
hard for me to say,

02:44.567 --> 02:45.733
but Danny's right.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.767
It's time to go.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.500
(upbeat music)

02:58.067 --> 02:59.067
- Ah!

02:59.067 --> 03:00.533
Did I tell you, Julie, Mum?

03:00.533 --> 03:02.667
It's being featured
in a magazine.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.967
That's how amazing
Danny's design is.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.167
So...

03:07.167 --> 03:08.067
Wow!

03:09.133 --> 03:10.200
Isn't that fantastic?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.900
(birds calling nearby)

03:13.900 --> 03:17.067
(upbeat music)

03:17.067 --> 03:17.900
- Wow!

03:17.900 --> 03:19.333
- Isn't it awesome?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.533
It's like a museum without
homework at the end.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.600
- It's not like a museum, Oscar.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.867
- Yeah, it is.

03:24.867 --> 03:28.433
- How is it like a
museum? (echoing)

03:28.433 --> 03:31.667
- Actually, Danny, I think
if it was a proper museum,

03:31.667 --> 03:34.700
you'd have to have a big row
of you-know-what's on the wall.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.567
Like they do at
thingo in Tasmania.

03:36.567 --> 03:37.633
- MONA.

03:39.067 --> 03:41.300
- Whoa, steady on, you didn't
see that, did you, Edwina?

03:41.300 --> 03:44.067
- The wall of vaginas was
making a point, Wayne.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.667
- Yeah, it was about
self-esteem, babe, remember?

03:46.667 --> 03:47.600
- Didn't help my self-esteem.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.767
What about you, Danny? (laughs)

03:48.767 --> 03:50.067
- You know what, can we,

03:50.067 --> 03:51.400
hey, Younis, can we
get off that please?

03:51.400 --> 03:53.467
- Dan, you should put
up one of those signs

03:53.467 --> 03:56.467
they have at museums to say
don't touch the displays.

03:56.467 --> 03:57.533
- It's not a display.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.067
- Then why can't he touch it?

03:59.067 --> 04:00.933
- He can touch it, he
just can't bench-press it.

04:00.933 --> 04:01.867
- Elevated push-up.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.200
- Yeah. I know.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.167
- What do you uh,
call that, Danny?

04:07.333 --> 04:08.900
- A coffee table.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.067
- A coffee table?

04:10.067 --> 04:11.767
Did a local artist do it?

04:11.767 --> 04:13.867
- No, no, it's not a sculpture.

04:13.867 --> 04:15.400
It's an actual coffee table.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.233
- Right, let's
get some stuff in.

04:17.233 --> 04:18.167
What's going in here?

04:18.167 --> 04:19.500
What's this room supposed to be?

04:19.500 --> 04:21.267
- This is the library.

04:21.267 --> 04:22.800
- The fucking library!

04:22.800 --> 04:25.067
Will we get to meet
Professor Plum?

04:25.067 --> 04:26.633
- Wow, it's weird.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.500
It's like it's something,
but it's kind of nothing.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.100
- Less is more,
apparently, Julie.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.167
Are you sure you like all
this concrete, darling?

04:33.167 --> 04:35.733
I feel like I'm in
a five-star carpark.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.100
- It's Danny's dream,
Mum, to build his own home

04:38.100 --> 04:39.733
and I don't think that
Minimalist Modern would be

04:39.733 --> 04:41.267
doing a feature if...

04:41.267 --> 04:42.500
Oh, hang on.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.300
Have we already
been in this room?

04:43.300 --> 04:44.433
- No, this is Level 2.

04:44.433 --> 04:46.467
You need color-coding
on your walls.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.400
- Well, I'm just
super, super happy that

04:48.400 --> 04:50.800
Danny's getting to
live out his dream.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.633
- Yeah.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.067
- Once you get
your furniture in,

04:54.067 --> 04:55.633
it could feel more like a home.

04:55.633 --> 04:58.567
- Our place felt like a
ridiculous, oversized box, too,

04:58.567 --> 05:00.433
until I warmed it up
with some cushions

05:00.433 --> 05:02.467
and some throws and now
look at it, eh, Danny?

05:02.467 --> 05:03.367
- Yeah.

05:04.533 --> 05:06.833
- Listen, I'm happy to
go down to Spotlight

05:06.833 --> 05:08.433
and grab you a couple of things.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.933
(upbeat music)

05:15.067 --> 05:16.600
- Okay, I've just left
the rest out the front

05:16.600 --> 05:17.733
'cause we've gotta go.

05:17.733 --> 05:19.467
- I should grab it.

05:19.467 --> 05:21.967
A lot of that Danish stuff
looks like hard rubbish.

05:21.967 --> 05:23.700
- I thought Troy
would've joined us today.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.867
- Why?

05:24.867 --> 05:25.667
- Well, he always
loves coming to the tip

05:25.667 --> 05:26.833
when we have a load.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.367
- When are you all
going realize Troy and I

05:28.367 --> 05:31.200
have not been together for
four years and it is over?

05:31.200 --> 05:32.700
- He was busy today anyway, Pop.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.833
- Doing what?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.867
It's Saturday,
Centrelink isn't open.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.300
Come on!

05:37.300 --> 05:38.533
Maybe Brianna will actually
have to lift something

05:38.533 --> 05:39.467
besides her phone!

05:39.467 --> 05:41.300
- Excuse me!

05:41.300 --> 05:42.800
Younis and I are
actually planning
something for our future,

05:42.800 --> 05:44.667
so that one day we might
have a house of our own.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.167
Because unlike you, we
don't want to live in

05:46.167 --> 05:48.800
a crappy bungalow out the back
of our mum and dad's place.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.067
Sorry, Dad, love you.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.067
- You're good.

05:51.067 --> 05:51.933
- Oh, and what's the big plan?

05:51.933 --> 05:53.133
Another fucking popup shop?

05:53.133 --> 05:53.967
- Amber!

05:53.967 --> 05:54.967
She had a go.

05:54.967 --> 05:56.167
(Amber scoffs)

05:56.167 --> 05:56.833
Well, you had a few
goes, didn't you, love?

05:56.833 --> 05:57.767
Was it four?

05:57.767 --> 05:58.700
- Five.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.900
- The cold-pressed juices.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.400
- And weirdly, no
one wanted to pay $15

06:01.400 --> 06:02.433
for decimated bok choy.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.633
- Kale.

06:03.633 --> 06:04.567
- Maybe we should've
tried bok choy.

06:04.567 --> 06:06.100
- Anyway, this is different.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.100
- We are auditioning
for "The Block."

06:08.100 --> 06:09.133
- Bullshit!

06:09.133 --> 06:10.400
- Fantastic!

06:10.400 --> 06:11.900
- It's the next step
in our relationship.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.467
- Why would you want to make
your relationship public?

06:14.467 --> 06:16.233
- To cement it and make it real.

06:16.233 --> 06:18.200
That's why it's called
reality TV, Amber.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.067
It's real.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.433
- Unbelievable!

06:20.433 --> 06:22.833
Someone pinched
the shade already.

06:22.833 --> 06:23.833
(bright music)

06:23.833 --> 06:26.167
(Amber snaps)

06:26.167 --> 06:29.133
(bright music)

06:29.133 --> 06:31.567
(car horn honking)

06:31.567 --> 06:32.500
- What's the time?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.667
- You've got plenty of time.

06:33.667 --> 06:34.700
Move, dickwad!

06:36.400 --> 06:38.767
(car rumbling)

06:38.767 --> 06:39.967
Feet!

06:39.967 --> 06:42.567
(upbeat music)

06:43.500 --> 06:46.100
(car rumbling)

06:48.667 --> 06:49.900
(car slams)

06:49.900 --> 06:52.400
What the fuck are you
doing in a Sportage?

06:53.900 --> 06:54.733
Who are they?

06:54.733 --> 06:56.200
- Uh...

06:56.200 --> 06:57.833
Girls.

06:57.833 --> 07:02.433
I'd like you to meet an
old lover of mine, Amber.

07:02.433 --> 07:06.200
Amber, this is
Taylor and Madison.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.133
- Yeah, hi.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.400
What are you doing with them?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.067
- Dropping them off to netball.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.300
- What are you, Mrs.
fucking Doubtfire?

07:12.300 --> 07:13.500
- I've met someone.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.767
- Who?

07:15.767 --> 07:16.733
- Their mother.

07:16.733 --> 07:17.433
- Shawn!
- Shawny!

07:18.867 --> 07:20.067
- You knew about this?

07:20.067 --> 07:21.100
- I've got to go.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.400
They're due on Court...

07:23.400 --> 07:24.233
Five?

07:24.233 --> 07:25.167
Five.

07:25.167 --> 07:26.600
- Let me get this straight.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.667
You've been to about
three of his matches ever,

07:28.667 --> 07:30.700
but these kids got
the full Mike Brady?

07:30.700 --> 07:33.700
- Amber, I've got
oranges for Shawny's game

07:33.700 --> 07:35.767
and I'm running the boundary
at the third quarter.

07:35.767 --> 07:36.600
(Amber scoffs)

07:36.600 --> 07:37.867
- Oh, there you are!

07:37.867 --> 07:40.600
We were looking for you
on Court Eight. (laughs)

07:40.600 --> 07:41.700
Yeah, sorry.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.600
I think I smell of canteen food.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.867
Mackenzie's had
a snot explosion.

07:44.867 --> 07:46.733
Babe, have you got any wipes?

07:46.733 --> 07:49.433
- Um, Amber, this is Micky.

07:49.433 --> 07:50.267
- Oh!

07:50.267 --> 07:51.400
Hello.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.267
- As in the mouse?

07:52.267 --> 07:53.433
- No. (laughs)

07:53.433 --> 07:54.633
As in Michelle.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.400
I know, right, Michelle,
Madison, Mackenzie.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
Poor Taylor! (laughs)

07:58.400 --> 07:59.633
Oh, my...

07:59.633 --> 08:00.733
Oh, my God!

08:00.733 --> 08:01.633
You're Amber!

08:04.167 --> 08:05.067
- [Amber] Oh!

08:06.067 --> 08:07.733
- Congratulations on Shawn.

08:07.733 --> 08:10.200
He is an amazing boy.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.667
- Ta.

08:11.667 --> 08:14.100
- Not surprising, considering
he had the best dad ever!

08:14.100 --> 08:14.933
(Mickey laughs)

08:14.933 --> 08:17.533
(bright music)

08:19.567 --> 08:21.067
- I really think they've
got what it takes

08:21.067 --> 08:22.800
for a full-on renovation show.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.500
- [Kayne] Yeah, they look hot.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.733
- Did she tell you?

08:25.733 --> 08:26.700
Don't you think Shaynna
Blaze would get on

08:26.700 --> 08:28.300
so well with Brianna?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.833
- Who?

08:29.833 --> 08:31.500
- She's from "The Block,"
Mum, that renovating show.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.433
- Which channel?

08:32.433 --> 08:33.267
- Nine.

08:33.267 --> 08:34.667
- Are they still going?

08:34.667 --> 08:36.133
- You should go on
"The Block," Dad.

08:36.133 --> 08:38.733
With someone who can do stuff,
though, like Uncle Kayne.

08:38.733 --> 08:39.667
- Bang up for it, Dan!

08:39.667 --> 08:41.100
- Okay, okay, firstly, firstly,

08:41.100 --> 08:42.600
my brand new walls, okay?

08:42.600 --> 08:46.267
And secondly, these racquets
are for competition only.

08:46.267 --> 08:47.200
And shuttlecocks.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.700
Okay?

08:48.700 --> 08:50.833
And thirdly, "The Block" is
not a show for architects.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.100
(all gasp)

08:53.100 --> 08:55.267
- Kayne, get the fluoro
masking tape out of the truck.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.100
- I'm fine.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.500
All good, all good.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.767
This,

08:58.767 --> 09:00.067
this wasn't working in
this space anyway, so.

09:00.067 --> 09:02.067
- I'll run a neat orange
line around it, Dan.

09:02.067 --> 09:02.900
Won't happen again.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.300
- No, no.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.767
No, no, I don't want
fluoro orange tape in here.

09:05.767 --> 09:07.067
In fact, I don't want any
of this stuff in here.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.333
Actually, could you
just stop, stop, stop.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.333
Stop.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.867
Could I just ask
everybody to uh,

09:10.867 --> 09:13.467
grab a box and just take
everything into the garage.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.767
- Uh, I thought that we
could all get some pizza

09:15.767 --> 09:18.167
and at least try and get
one room looking good.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.067
Like home.

09:21.067 --> 09:23.333
- Baby, I've got my
interview in the morning.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.067
- Oh yeah, Bess told us,
for the mini magazine.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.600
- Minimalist.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.100
Minimalist Modern magazine.

09:31.167 --> 09:32.600
It's uh, it's import only.

09:34.067 --> 09:34.867
Very prestigious.

09:38.067 --> 09:39.533
(sighs) Look, look,
it'll take too much time

09:39.533 --> 09:41.733
to unpack this stuff, so let's
just move all this stuff out.

09:41.733 --> 09:44.267
Let's just move it
all out here and then,

09:44.267 --> 09:46.967
that way, we can take
our time with it.

09:46.967 --> 09:48.433
- And tonight?

09:48.433 --> 09:49.800
- Well, we'll just use
the furniture I've set up

09:49.800 --> 09:50.800
for the photo shoot.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.333
- Bess, why don't you
and the children come

09:54.333 --> 09:56.267
and stay at my
place and that way

09:56.267 --> 09:58.333
the chair, the cactus,
and the concrete

09:58.333 --> 10:00.400
will be kept nice for
Danny for the morning.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.233
- She means--

10:01.233 --> 10:02.067
- That's a great idea!

10:02.067 --> 10:02.900
- Wait, really?

10:02.900 --> 10:03.933
- Yeah!

10:03.933 --> 10:04.767
That makes sense.

10:04.767 --> 10:05.700
Mwah!

10:05.700 --> 10:06.433
- Can I stay here with Dad?

10:06.433 --> 10:07.767
- Yes.
- No.

10:07.767 --> 10:10.367
(upbeat music)

10:15.433 --> 10:18.433
(Bess sighs)

10:18.433 --> 10:19.267
- Oh!

10:20.433 --> 10:23.400
It is like a Barcelona
chair took a Valium

10:23.400 --> 10:26.433
and put on some
Ugg boots. (laughs)

10:27.800 --> 10:29.367
Oh, isn't this fun?

10:30.667 --> 10:31.733
Girls' night!

10:32.867 --> 10:34.667
Watching the telly
with my girls.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.033
- Are you all right?

10:37.033 --> 10:38.400
- I'm fine.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.400
- [Margaret] I'm not.

10:40.533 --> 10:43.233
(dramatic music)

10:45.000 --> 10:47.567
(bright music)

11:32.300 --> 11:34.333
- Okay, straight up,

11:34.333 --> 11:35.500
is it working?

11:35.500 --> 11:38.233
- Sweetheart, that's fantastic!

11:38.233 --> 11:39.067
(Brianna laughs)

11:39.067 --> 11:40.300
- I'm speechless.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.500
It's exactly like you
see in the movies.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.333
- Wow!

11:42.333 --> 11:43.600
Thank you.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.567
It's a template that
comes with iMovie.

11:44.567 --> 11:45.733
I'm really happy with it.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.067
- He edited it on this.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.067
- Really?

11:48.067 --> 11:48.867
I can't even find the smileys.

11:48.867 --> 11:49.833
(all laugh)

11:49.833 --> 11:51.067
- Emojis, Pop. (chuckles)

11:51.067 --> 11:52.167
- You'll get on
that show for sure.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.500
- Don't just say it, Mum.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.733
No, really?

11:54.733 --> 11:55.567
(both laugh)

11:55.567 --> 11:56.800
- Yes!

11:56.800 --> 11:58.467
- Scotty Cam is
gonna love you guys.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.767
- Where did they meet?

11:59.767 --> 12:01.333
- Hello?

12:01.333 --> 12:02.500
A chance encounter at the gym
with a kettlebell collision.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.333
Weren't you watching?

12:03.333 --> 12:04.300
- Not you.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.933
Troy and Micky.

12:05.933 --> 12:06.867
- (stammers) I don't know.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.100
At the shops or something.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.133
- How could they
meet at the shops?

12:09.133 --> 12:11.133
Your dad doesn't have any money.

12:11.133 --> 12:12.967
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.067
- I thought you'd freak out.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.500
- Why would I freak out?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.800
I broke up with him!

12:16.800 --> 12:18.500
- Amber, you are so selfish.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.333
We're meant to be talking
about my audition video.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.700
- Oh, you mean the audition
video for a building show

12:22.700 --> 12:24.900
where you aren't doing
any fucking building?

12:26.800 --> 12:28.400
- Babe.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.467
We forgot building.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.067
(gasps) I know something
we can demolish!

12:32.067 --> 12:34.433
- Do not touch my bungalow!

12:34.433 --> 12:36.067
(fridge door slams)

12:36.067 --> 12:39.133
("Silbo" by Feloche)

12:53.233 --> 12:54.933
- And he's away.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.233
The people's champion.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.500
Bright, Bright, Bright!

12:59.667 --> 13:00.500
- [Oscar] Ow!

13:00.500 --> 13:01.800
- Eh?

13:01.800 --> 13:03.400
Oscar, what are you doing?

13:03.400 --> 13:04.967
- I wanted to stay
with you, Dad.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.167
- Oh!

13:06.167 --> 13:07.400
- I didn't want to share
a room with Edwina.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.067
She has all these rules.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.800
Like, you have to have a shower.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.267
- That's a reasonable rule.

13:12.267 --> 13:14.667
- But she says it every day.

13:14.667 --> 13:15.500
- Here.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.700
- Dad, you play pool.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.533
Vodka and orange?

13:17.533 --> 13:18.700
- Oh, yes, please.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.267
- So, I wanted to ask you guys,

13:23.267 --> 13:25.833
if Younis and I could
"The Block" the house.

13:25.833 --> 13:27.100
- What, our house?

13:27.100 --> 13:29.267
- Imagine this room,
the bar, the pool table,

13:29.267 --> 13:30.733
with an update.

13:30.733 --> 13:31.833
- What would you update?

13:31.833 --> 13:33.233
- Dad, you heard Amber.

13:33.233 --> 13:34.600
You have to have building.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.500
- But sweetheart,
there's no before here.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.867
You can't have a
good after video

13:38.867 --> 13:40.400
unless you have a good before.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.600
(Brianna sighs)

13:41.600 --> 13:43.067
- Your mum's right.

13:43.067 --> 13:43.867
(light clicks on)

13:43.867 --> 13:44.767
Quick game?

13:44.767 --> 13:47.767
(Brianna groans)

13:47.767 --> 13:50.600
(Brianna sobbing)

13:52.867 --> 13:54.867
- I'm never gonna
get on "The Block."

13:54.867 --> 13:56.333
I never complete anything.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.133
I'm good at starting things.

13:58.133 --> 14:01.700
- That is so 150% not true.

14:01.700 --> 14:05.833
You are really, really
good at completing me.

14:05.833 --> 14:07.267
- Oh, for shit's sake.

14:07.267 --> 14:08.700
- Okay?

14:08.700 --> 14:10.200
As long as we have each other,

14:11.100 --> 14:12.933
nothing else matters.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.867
(cars racing on TV)

14:14.867 --> 14:15.933
(Younis humming)

14:15.933 --> 14:17.833
- Do that one.

14:17.833 --> 14:18.667
(Younis hums)

14:18.667 --> 14:20.467
(Brianna laughs)

14:20.467 --> 14:22.067
- Are you sure this is a bed?

14:22.067 --> 14:24.200
- Yes, mate, yes, it's a pod.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.833
It's very, very
big in Scandinavia.

14:25.833 --> 14:28.400
- So is IKEA and they
have proper beds.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.600
- Yeah, well, this is bespoke,

14:29.600 --> 14:31.067
which means nobody else has it.

14:31.067 --> 14:32.167
Doesn't that feel good?

14:32.167 --> 14:33.133
- Not really.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.533
I like Caspian's bed.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.067
It's big and super bouncy.

14:36.067 --> 14:37.433
- Yeah, well, trust
me, you will get used

14:37.433 --> 14:39.400
to a life without clutter

14:39.400 --> 14:41.600
very quickly indeed, okay?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.300
- Can I have a blanket?

14:43.300 --> 14:44.367
- Don't need it in the pod.

14:44.367 --> 14:47.100
(lights zap off)

14:52.600 --> 14:55.267
(Danny snoring)

14:57.400 --> 14:59.067
Oscar.

14:59.067 --> 14:59.867
Oscar.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.433
- Hmm?

15:01.433 --> 15:02.600
- It's okay.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.067
You're only scared
'cause the house is new.

15:04.067 --> 15:06.100
- I wasn't scared.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.300
I was uncomfortable.

15:08.433 --> 15:10.400
I felt like that
time we went camping

15:10.400 --> 15:11.933
and my lilo had a hole in it.

15:11.933 --> 15:13.167
- Mm.

15:13.167 --> 15:14.200
- And I woke up with
all those sharp rocks

15:14.200 --> 15:15.433
sticking into my hips.

15:15.433 --> 15:17.433
And because you pitched
the tent on the slope,

15:17.433 --> 15:19.067
all the blood had rushed my head

15:19.067 --> 15:20.933
and I vomited on you.

15:20.933 --> 15:21.800
Remember that?

15:23.200 --> 15:24.067
- Go to sleep.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.700
What?

15:32.700 --> 15:34.433
What? What now?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.533
- I think the pod
is more comfortable.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.767
(mobile ringing)

15:44.133 --> 15:46.700
(Bess crashes)

15:50.433 --> 15:52.133
- Bess, I need your help.

15:52.133 --> 15:53.167
You okay?

15:53.167 --> 15:54.400
- Yes!

15:54.400 --> 15:56.200
Just got up a
little too quickly.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.067
What's wrong?

15:57.067 --> 15:58.600
- Can we

15:58.600 --> 16:01.367
do a room over at your new
house while it's empty?

16:01.367 --> 16:03.133
- Oh, I thought someone had
been arrested or had a tumor!

16:03.133 --> 16:04.300
Of course you can.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.133
That would be great.

16:05.133 --> 16:06.433
(Brianna squeals)

16:06.433 --> 16:08.567
(rap music)

16:08.567 --> 16:10.500
* I work my fingers
to the bone *

16:10.500 --> 16:12.567
* I'm gonna make
my hood a home *

16:12.567 --> 16:14.667
* I'll build a
palace of my own *

16:14.667 --> 16:17.067
* We'll struggle street
has just got a throne *

16:17.067 --> 16:18.567
- I was nine years
old, I remember,

16:18.567 --> 16:22.433
and I whittled this piece of
hardwood into a spinning top.

16:22.433 --> 16:24.300
And I realize, of course, now,

16:24.300 --> 16:26.067
that was where my
love of the bespoke

16:26.067 --> 16:27.533
really began.
- Mm-hmm.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.533
- And so this, it's really
just another spinning top,

16:29.533 --> 16:30.467
you know?

16:30.467 --> 16:31.867
Just a reflection of who I am...

16:31.867 --> 16:32.800
- Mm-hmm.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.567
- And how I see the world.

16:33.567 --> 16:34.400
Playful.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.933
- Dad, I can't walk.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.300
I think my hip's twisted
after sleeping in the pod.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.133
- Excuse me.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.367
I'll just be a second.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.800
(rock music)

16:46.667 --> 16:48.133
Sorry, Anoushka, sorry.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.733
Go on, go on.

16:49.733 --> 16:51.200
- Well, is it important for you

16:51.200 --> 16:53.333
to have common material
threads between the spaces?

16:53.333 --> 16:54.267
- Mm, yes.

16:54.267 --> 16:55.800
Yes, definitely, definitely.

16:55.800 --> 17:00.200
Um, for me, with House One,
I really wanted there to be,

17:00.200 --> 17:03.400
like, each environment is
hewn from the same block,

17:03.400 --> 17:04.633
you know?
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.633 --> 17:06.967
- Which really does
exemplify the sort of

17:06.967 --> 17:10.400
no fuss, no clutter way
that I choose to live.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.233
(object rumbling)

17:11.233 --> 17:12.067
Uh, sorry, guys, stop.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.067
Stop, stopping!

17:13.067 --> 17:14.533
What are we doing?

17:14.533 --> 17:17.767
- Bess said we could do a
room makeover for "The Block."

17:17.767 --> 17:20.300
(upbeat music)

17:20.300 --> 17:21.800
- Hey, Danny!

17:21.800 --> 17:23.433
I know that I said that I
would be around mid-morning,

17:23.433 --> 17:27.833
but Mum just wanted me to
help rearrange some furniture.

17:29.467 --> 17:30.567
Brianna's doing what?

17:32.433 --> 17:33.900
Oh.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.067
- Listen, if I could ask that
Minimalist Modern magazine

17:36.067 --> 17:36.900
could follow me on Instagram--

17:36.900 --> 17:38.133
- Absolutely.

17:38.133 --> 17:38.800
- That would mean
the world to me.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.733
- No problem.

17:39.733 --> 17:40.400
Um, it's just @brighteyes.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.200
Sorry, stop!

17:41.200 --> 17:42.300
Stop!

17:42.300 --> 17:43.400
- Self portrait.

17:44.267 --> 17:45.533
(laughs) Just kidding!

17:45.533 --> 17:47.100
How cute is it?

17:47.100 --> 17:47.933
- Uh...

17:49.700 --> 17:51.533
- Are you going on "The Block?"

17:51.533 --> 17:52.367
- No!

17:52.367 --> 17:53.467
God, no.

17:53.467 --> 17:54.733
No.

17:54.733 --> 17:55.633
- But they said you're
going on "The Block."

17:55.633 --> 17:57.700
- Uh, no, they didn't.

17:57.700 --> 17:58.533
Yeah, no, yes, they did.

17:58.533 --> 18:00.633
They are my charity.

18:00.633 --> 18:01.733
It's a pro bono thing, you know,

18:01.733 --> 18:03.067
like Doctors Without Borders.

18:03.067 --> 18:06.633
They are Designers
Without Ideas.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.133
I'm mentoring them.

18:08.133 --> 18:09.567
You know, but please don't
put that in the article,

18:09.567 --> 18:12.533
because I'm very, very
private about my philanthropy.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.067
Thanks so much
for coming, again.

18:14.067 --> 18:14.867
Appreciate it.

18:14.867 --> 18:15.733
Thanks, Anoushka.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.433
Bye-bye.

18:17.433 --> 18:20.067
(upbeat music)

18:21.767 --> 18:22.967
- What does it matter?

18:22.967 --> 18:23.767
The house is empty
at the moment anyway.

18:23.767 --> 18:24.967
- No, it's not empty.

18:24.967 --> 18:26.800
It's actually a fully
functioning home.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.200
- There's nothing in it!

18:28.200 --> 18:29.933
The library has no books.

18:29.933 --> 18:31.900
- Yes, because
they're all online.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.300
This is a neutral
space to think,

18:34.300 --> 18:35.800
to contemplate.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.833
- To contemplate how much
you wish you had some books.

18:37.833 --> 18:38.933
And cushions!

18:38.933 --> 18:40.067
- Oh!

18:40.067 --> 18:41.667
Oh, what is the
obsession with cushions?

18:41.667 --> 18:44.767
Why must we have cushions
everywhere, all the time?

18:44.767 --> 18:47.067
You think Charles and
Ray Eames worried about

18:47.067 --> 18:48.967
where to put the
cushions on the chaise?

18:48.967 --> 18:50.200
- Probably.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.533
After they sat in
it for two minutes.

18:51.533 --> 18:53.233
- Why do we need so much stuff?

18:53.233 --> 18:54.700
We have too much stuff!

18:54.700 --> 18:57.600
- There is a big gap
between too much stuff

18:57.600 --> 18:58.867
and no stuff!

18:58.867 --> 19:01.100
- See, you're just
so used to clutter

19:01.100 --> 19:03.833
that you have no idea
that this is actually

19:03.833 --> 19:06.833
aesthetically soothing
and perfect as it is.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.200
- Where am I in here?

19:08.200 --> 19:09.367
Where are the kids?

19:09.367 --> 19:11.500
There's no evidence
of us in here.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.133
- That's the whole point!

19:15.333 --> 19:19.333
- The whole point is to create
a place where I don't exist?

19:19.333 --> 19:20.167
- No, no.

19:20.167 --> 19:21.433
That's not what I meant.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.233
Of course this is
totally your house

19:23.233 --> 19:24.667
and you can do whatever--

19:24.667 --> 19:25.767
please don't put that
there, I've arranged those--

19:25.767 --> 19:26.833
Oops!

19:26.833 --> 19:27.667
- What is wrong with you?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.300
- Nothing!

19:29.300 --> 19:30.133
Except...

19:31.967 --> 19:33.800
Isn't it my turn?

19:33.800 --> 19:35.067
- Your turn for what?

19:35.067 --> 19:36.133
- For a turn!

19:37.200 --> 19:38.500
At the space!

19:40.733 --> 19:42.667
- Quick, Dan, can
you grab my end?

19:42.667 --> 19:43.600
- I'll help.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.200
Half of this house is mine.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.533
And they are doing a room
makeover in my bit of the space.

19:48.533 --> 19:49.600
Mm-hmm.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.500
Over there.

19:51.567 --> 19:52.400
- Ah!

19:53.833 --> 19:56.400
(gentle music)

20:00.800 --> 20:01.767
* Here a quack there a quack

20:01.767 --> 20:03.267
* Everywhere a quack-quack

20:03.267 --> 20:06.333
* Old MacDonald had a farm

20:06.333 --> 20:09.167
* E-I-E-I-O

20:09.167 --> 20:11.633
* On that farm he had a

20:11.633 --> 20:12.467
- Duck!

20:12.467 --> 20:13.300
- Duck!

20:13.300 --> 20:15.633
* E-I-E-I-O

20:15.633 --> 20:16.867
* With a quack-quack here
and a quack-quack there *

20:16.867 --> 20:18.500
- Bullshit.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.067
* Here a quack there a quack

20:20.067 --> 20:21.633
* Everywhere a quack-quack

20:21.633 --> 20:22.833
* Old MacDonald

20:22.833 --> 20:24.900
(door slams)

20:24.900 --> 20:27.300
- How do you know "Old
MacDonald Had a Farm?"

20:27.300 --> 20:28.300
- Amber.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.233
(music stops)

20:29.233 --> 20:30.500
Everyone knows he had a farm.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.300
- I'm talking about
the song, you idiot.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.133
- Shawn said you'd
be here at 1:00.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.600
- It's 1:15.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.800
How about a round of
"What's the Time, Mr. Wolf?"

20:37.800 --> 20:38.633
- That'd be fun.

20:38.633 --> 20:39.467
(Amber sighs)

20:39.467 --> 20:40.733
You ever played that?

20:40.733 --> 20:41.633
- All right, I've got
it, Father of the Year.

20:41.633 --> 20:43.400
What's the deal?

20:43.400 --> 20:46.133
- Shawn's gone down
to the shops, he'll
be back in a minute.

20:46.133 --> 20:47.433
- You're cashing in, aren't you?

20:47.433 --> 20:48.633
Childcare.

20:48.633 --> 20:50.367
- Don't cheapen this, Amber.

20:50.367 --> 20:51.867
- Nothing cheap about it, Troy.

20:51.867 --> 20:52.833
What are you clearing?

20:52.833 --> 20:54.667
120, 210, 500 a fortnight?

20:54.667 --> 20:56.533
- This is legit, Amber!

20:56.533 --> 20:58.733
- That's what you said
about the alpacas.

20:58.733 --> 21:01.367
- Well, they didn't look
like goats in the picture!

21:01.367 --> 21:04.533
Look, Michelle loves me.

21:04.533 --> 21:07.067
- Which is why it's not
fair on the poor girl

21:07.067 --> 21:07.867
that you're doing this!

21:07.867 --> 21:09.600
- Yeah, and I love her!

21:09.600 --> 21:11.233
- What about us?

21:11.233 --> 21:12.300
- What?

21:12.300 --> 21:13.133
- What?

21:14.200 --> 21:15.967
- Oh, hello!

21:15.967 --> 21:18.100
What a nice surprise!

21:18.100 --> 21:19.267
Mwah!
- Hi, Mum.

21:19.267 --> 21:20.500
- I'm sorry the
place is such a mess.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.667
Did Troy ask you
to stay for lunch?

21:21.667 --> 21:22.933
He's made his
famous pumpkin soup.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.200
You must. Yay!

21:26.733 --> 21:29.333
(gentle music)

21:30.300 --> 21:32.800
(tense music)

22:12.067 --> 22:14.800
- [Kayne] Okay, this
will be the final shot!

22:14.800 --> 22:16.467
And action!

22:16.467 --> 22:17.300
Cue door!

22:18.633 --> 22:19.567
Cue door!

22:20.567 --> 22:21.400
Cue the door.

22:23.833 --> 22:24.900
Yes.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.733
Yes!

22:25.733 --> 22:26.900
Oh!

22:26.900 --> 22:29.067
Okay, show me something
in the face, Dan.

22:29.900 --> 22:30.733
Bring it alive, now.

22:30.733 --> 22:31.867
- Oh, it's beautiful.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.300
- Ooh!

22:33.300 --> 22:34.133
- [Kayne] Yes!

22:34.133 --> 22:35.067
- [Dan] Oh, dear.

22:35.067 --> 22:36.267
- [Kayne] Welcome to heaven!

22:36.267 --> 22:38.067
It's glitz, it's glamor,
it's now, it's chic!

22:38.067 --> 22:39.200
- [Dan] Oh, my God.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.867
- [Kayne] And let's
meet our artist.

22:40.867 --> 22:42.733
There she is, there's our girl.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.133
- (gasping) Oh, my!

22:45.133 --> 22:46.533
- Wicked!

22:46.533 --> 22:47.733
Are they your eyes?

22:47.733 --> 22:49.967
- [Kayne] Yes,
windows to the soul!

22:51.700 --> 22:52.667
- It's her signature.

22:52.667 --> 22:53.633
- Too much?

22:53.633 --> 22:54.533
- No!

22:54.533 --> 22:55.767
No.

22:55.767 --> 22:58.767
Maybe if it was your
whole face, but that's--

22:58.767 --> 22:59.600
- And you know what
the real surprise is?

22:59.600 --> 23:01.433
- There's a surprise?

23:01.433 --> 23:02.800
- Happy housewarming!

23:02.800 --> 23:04.367
- We all pitched in.

23:04.367 --> 23:05.767
It's yours to keep.

23:05.767 --> 23:06.900
- Hmm.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.600
- What did you get them?

23:08.600 --> 23:09.867
- A Russell Hobbs kettle.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.467
(gentle music)

23:19.833 --> 23:22.100
- Finally, we can eat!

23:23.700 --> 23:25.600
Are you going to help?

23:25.600 --> 23:27.267
- I'm not quite ready to unpack.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.667
- What, so that's it, then?

23:29.667 --> 23:30.833
We've got the Playboy
Mansion in the front room

23:30.833 --> 23:32.333
and we're just
gonna live with it?

23:32.333 --> 23:33.267
- No.

23:33.267 --> 23:34.500
But what was I supposed to say?

23:34.500 --> 23:35.667
- Oh, I don't know, how about,

23:35.667 --> 23:37.767
"Here's why Harvey
Norman should be shot!"

23:37.767 --> 23:39.433
Or, hey, wait, wait,
where are you going?

23:39.433 --> 23:40.267
- To the kitchen.

23:40.267 --> 23:41.267
- What's in the box?

23:41.267 --> 23:42.267
- Plates and bowls.

23:42.267 --> 23:43.467
(Dan inhales deeply)

23:43.467 --> 23:44.400
Are we allowed plates
or is the kitchen

23:44.400 --> 23:46.200
an online neutral space, too?

23:46.200 --> 23:48.067
- I don't want any clutter.

23:48.067 --> 23:49.733
- So should we mime eating?

23:49.733 --> 23:51.067
- Look, okay, okay,

23:51.067 --> 23:52.767
I am supervising
the unpacking now,

23:52.767 --> 23:53.933
because I am sick
of being overrun

23:53.933 --> 23:56.300
by mess and chaos and clutter!

23:56.300 --> 23:57.100
- Wait.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.667
I'm the mess?

24:00.667 --> 24:02.867
I'm the chaos?

24:02.867 --> 24:04.100
Okay, fine.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.567
I'm gonna live out
here in the garage!

24:06.567 --> 24:08.800
In the mess and the clutter

24:08.800 --> 24:12.067
because at least it's
my mess and my clutter

24:12.067 --> 24:14.300
and it's better than
living in there,

24:14.300 --> 24:16.067
in that mausoleum!

24:17.600 --> 24:18.833
- You don't want
to move in there?

24:18.833 --> 24:21.067
- You won't let
me move in there!

24:21.067 --> 24:22.500
- What's going on?

24:22.500 --> 24:24.133
- Dad's freaking out because
he's tired of feeling

24:24.133 --> 24:26.200
squashed by Mum's
big, messy family,

24:26.200 --> 24:28.233
but he's making it
about the furniture.

24:28.233 --> 24:29.400
Mum's freaking out
because the whole

24:29.400 --> 24:30.800
new house replacing
the old house

24:30.800 --> 24:33.200
is making her relive
the adoption thing.

24:35.067 --> 24:35.867
- Cool.

24:39.267 --> 24:42.067
(dramatic music)

24:44.900 --> 24:46.067
- 10 more scoops and I'm done.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.233
Hop.

24:47.233 --> 24:49.167
- I might stay at Dad's
house this weekend.

24:49.167 --> 24:50.200
- It's not your dad's house.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.433
Hop. Hop.

24:51.433 --> 24:52.500
- Do you mind?

24:52.500 --> 24:53.667
- Why would I mind?

24:53.667 --> 24:54.900
Hop.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.167
- Thought you might
be a bit jealous.

24:56.167 --> 24:57.633
- Of her?

24:57.633 --> 24:59.567
Having to look after three kids
and a big fucking man baby?

24:59.567 --> 25:01.800
Yeah, I'm spewing that
opportunity passed me by.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.633
- Hop!

25:02.633 --> 25:03.667
It's all right, love.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.900
- Yeah, I know.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.333
- Hopping!

25:06.333 --> 25:07.733
The good part about Troy finally
being out of the picture,

25:07.733 --> 25:08.900
hop!

25:08.900 --> 25:10.400
Is you can get out
there and meet someone.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.933
- Like me and Younis.

25:11.933 --> 25:12.767
Hop!

25:12.767 --> 25:13.700
- Hop now!

25:13.700 --> 25:14.433
- Hopping!
- Hop!

25:14.433 --> 25:15.500
- Hop, hop!

25:15.500 --> 25:16.333
(chicken squawks)

25:16.333 --> 25:17.833
- [All] Oh!

25:17.833 --> 25:19.333
- I can't stay in the zone
if you all keep yelling hop!

25:19.333 --> 25:20.633
It's too much pressure.

25:20.633 --> 25:21.467
- Younis and I are next!

25:21.467 --> 25:23.067
- After your dad and me.

25:23.067 --> 25:24.667
Come here.

25:24.667 --> 25:28.267
(chicken clucking in game)

25:28.267 --> 25:29.433
- Hop!

25:29.433 --> 25:31.367
Why doesn't it
throw anybody else?

25:31.367 --> 25:33.933
(bright music)

25:38.467 --> 25:39.700
(Bess sighs)

25:39.700 --> 25:42.633
(car horn blaring
"La Cucaracha")

25:42.633 --> 25:43.567
- They're here.

25:43.567 --> 25:44.800
- Well, don't let them in

25:44.800 --> 25:47.467
if they're carrying
soft furnishings.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.800
- Thank you for inviting them.

25:52.167 --> 25:53.533
- Thank you for
moving in with me.

25:53.533 --> 25:55.100
(gentle music)

25:55.100 --> 25:56.833
- It just looks so sad now.

25:56.833 --> 26:00.300
It's like you've traded
your Ferrari for a Toyota.

26:00.300 --> 26:01.900
- Well, maybe a Lexus.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.700
- It's a stuck-up
Camry, same thing.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.500
- Well, I just needed
my things around me.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.333
- I get it.

26:08.333 --> 26:09.467
It actually looks great!

26:17.200 --> 26:19.067
So starving!

26:19.067 --> 26:21.400
(food sizzling)

26:21.400 --> 26:23.133
- Maybe it needs
a bit more heat?

26:23.133 --> 26:24.167
- No, no, no, not those logs.

26:24.167 --> 26:25.133
They're just for...

26:26.233 --> 26:28.067
For, I've got heat beads.

26:28.067 --> 26:29.100
Yeah.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.333
Yeah.

26:30.333 --> 26:33.067
- Seriously, Danny, this
was the coffee table?

26:33.067 --> 26:34.367
- It's so much more practical

26:34.367 --> 26:36.233
and a lot harder to trip over.

26:36.233 --> 26:37.700
(both laugh)

26:37.700 --> 26:39.167
- See, if you'd done something
like this for "The Block,"

26:39.167 --> 26:41.500
Brianna, you might
not have got rejected.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.433
- Don't go there.

26:42.433 --> 26:43.900
I still cannot believe it.

26:43.900 --> 26:45.367
- Neither can I, after
what you did to that room.

26:45.367 --> 26:46.200
- I know!

26:46.200 --> 26:47.133
But it wasn't even that.

26:47.133 --> 26:48.167
They just didn't like the house.

26:48.167 --> 26:49.967
- (spits) Sorry? What?

26:49.967 --> 26:51.500
- Mental, right?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.067
It was so awesome.

26:53.067 --> 26:54.967
But they said I didn't do
enough to, what was it?

26:54.967 --> 26:56.433
- Disguise the bones.

26:56.433 --> 26:57.400
- [Brianna] Mm.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.067
- Disguise the...

26:59.067 --> 27:02.333
This house was a
problem for "The Block?"

27:02.333 --> 27:03.233
Ow!

27:03.233 --> 27:04.067
- Ooh, still tricky.

27:04.067 --> 27:04.900
Kayne, get the tape.

27:04.900 --> 27:06.133
- No, no, no, no, no.

27:06.133 --> 27:07.333
- Don't stress, Danny,
we're not giving up.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.367
We've already started
on our MKR pitch.

27:09.367 --> 27:10.667
We're gonna smash it.

27:10.667 --> 27:11.667
We've made up these kebabs.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.067
What do they have on them, babe?

27:13.067 --> 27:14.533
- Protein powder marinade.

27:14.533 --> 27:15.400
- PPM.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.700
It's amaze!

27:16.700 --> 27:18.200
(food sizzling)

27:18.200 --> 27:19.467
("Hard Labour" by Grace
Robinson and Doyle McLachlan)

27:19.467 --> 27:21.600
- Yeah, I'm just not
sure why you thought

27:21.600 --> 27:23.500
there was something
wrong with the house.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.567
- It's a house?

27:24.567 --> 27:25.733
Mate, it's a catacomb.

27:25.733 --> 27:27.300
We'll have people
looking for the bodies.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.767
- Right, okay, well,
have you heard of

27:28.767 --> 27:31.267
Minimalist Modern magazine?

27:31.267 --> 27:33.433
- Shaynna, you heard of
Minimalist Modern magazine?

27:33.433 --> 27:34.700
- No, what's that?

27:35.733 --> 27:37.800
- It's import only.

27:37.800 --> 27:38.900
It's very prestigious.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.333
Anyway, the point is, they
thought my brutalist look

27:42.333 --> 27:44.067
was outstanding.

27:44.067 --> 27:45.367
- Well, that is
terrific, champion,

27:45.367 --> 27:46.667
I'm very happy for you.

27:46.667 --> 27:47.867
- Who is it?

27:47.867 --> 27:48.667
- Oh, it's some bloke
who's dirty about

27:48.667 --> 27:49.900
not being on the show.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.933
- No, I'm not dirty I
didn't get on the show.

27:51.933 --> 27:53.233
Actually, I am a bit.

27:53.233 --> 27:54.600
- Tell him to come
back next year.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.433
- Well, that's a good idea.

27:55.433 --> 27:56.700
Come back next year.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.200
Put your application in then.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.233
- No, I don't want to put
my application in next--

28:00.233 --> 28:01.200
(line beeping)

28:01.200 --> 28:02.433
Hello?

28:02.433 --> 28:03.267
You...

28:04.800 --> 28:06.333
* All work no play
makes Jack dope *

28:06.333 --> 28:07.800
Oh, no.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.500
Oh, God, this
chair's sensational.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.467
Oh.

28:11.467 --> 28:12.433
* Because a damn hard labor

28:12.433 --> 28:16.900
* Left my labor my enabler

28:16.900 --> 28:21.133
* All work no play
makes Jack dope *
