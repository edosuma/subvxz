WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:05.439
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT, MAN?
(laughing)

00:05.439 --> 00:08.409
(sniffs) OH, MAN, THOSE
CHRISTMAS COOKIES SMELL GREAT!

00:08.409 --> 00:11.479
HERE, ERNIE,
I SAVED THIS FOR YOU.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.746
OH!

00:12.746 --> 00:15.149
(grunting)

00:15.149 --> 00:17.685
LOOK AT HIM GO!

00:17.685 --> 00:20.321
THIS EXPLAINS WHY
HE NEVER GOT A SECOND DATE

00:20.321 --> 00:22.456
WITH THAT GIRL THAT WORE
CHOCOLATE LIP GLOSS.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.926
"WELL, GOOD NIGHT"...
(imitates Ernie grunting)

00:25.926 --> 00:28.796
ERNIE, ERNIE, SLOW DOWN.
YOU'RE GONNA CHIP A TOOTH.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.198
(grunts loudly)

00:31.565 --> 00:34.168
DON'T DO IT, ANGIE.
YOUR HAND SMELLS LIKE BATTER.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.036
YOU'LL LOSE AN ARM.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.507
(to tune of "Deck the Halls")
* VIC PALMERO SE VA A MIAMI *

00:39.507 --> 00:42.543
* PA TA PA TA PA,
CHA CHA CHA CHA *

00:42.543 --> 00:44.712
LOOK, IT'S A CUBAN SANTA CLAUS.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.747
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A SLEIGH OR REINDEER,

00:46.747 --> 00:50.184
HE'S JUST GOT A RAFT
PULLED BY 12 RELATIVES.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.052
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.454
I'M IN A GREAT MOOD.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.689
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH YOUR SISTER.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.626
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
THE ENTIRE PALMERO FAMILY

00:58.626 --> 01:00.094
WILL BE IN MIAMI
FOR CHRISTMAS!

01:00.094 --> 01:02.096
(gasps)
WE'RE HAVING A REUNION!

01:02.096 --> 01:03.564
OH, THAT IS JUST SO GREAT!

01:03.564 --> 01:06.467
THE WHOLE FAMILY
HASN'T BEEN TOGETHER IN YEARS!

01:06.467 --> 01:09.537
WHOA, ANGIE. I CAN'T YOUR WHOLE
FAMILY TALKING DOWN TO ME.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.872
I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST GONNA
SEE YOUR AUNT CLAUDIA.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.507
AT LEAST WHEN SHE INSULTS ME,

01:13.507 --> 01:15.676
I CAN JUST TURN DOWN
HER OXYGEN TANK.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.077
SHE FALLS ASLEEP.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.347
YOU TURNED DOWN
MY AUNT'S OXYGEN TANK?

01:19.347 --> 01:21.515
OH, OF COURSE NOT. WHAT KIND
OF PERSON YOU THINK I AM?

01:21.515 --> 01:23.484
I JUST PINCHED
THE HOSE A LITTLE BIT.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.119
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT,
GEORGE?

01:25.119 --> 01:26.854
YOU'RE A BIG SUCCESS, MAN.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.923
YEAH, GEORGE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT, EH?

01:29.923 --> 01:31.492
THERE'LL BE SIX DOCTORS THERE,

01:31.492 --> 01:35.463
EIGHT LAWYERS, TWO JUDGES,
A STATE SENATOR

01:35.463 --> 01:38.065
AND ONE FACTORY WORKER.

01:38.065 --> 01:41.169
MAYBE YOU CAN TELL THEM
WHAT IT'S LIKE

01:41.169 --> 01:43.637
TO EAT LUNCH FROM A TRUCK.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.374
AND MAYBE YOU CAN TELL 'EM
WHAT IT'S LIKE

01:46.374 --> 01:48.509
TO LIE ABOUT YOUR AGE
ON YOUR INTERNET DATING AD.

01:48.509 --> 01:53.514
THAT'S RIGHT, I WENT ONLINE.
I'M "JUICY MARIA 818."

01:53.514 --> 01:56.517
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:56.517 --> 02:00.254
REALLY? YOU GET STOOD UP
FOR COFFEE LAST SATURDAY?

02:00.254 --> 02:02.790
DAMN IT!

02:02.790 --> 02:06.260
WHAT ABOUT JESSICA 1960?

02:06.260 --> 02:10.264
SHOW UP AT THE PARK,
TAKE YOUR CHANCES.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.833
FINE. I CAN TAKE A JOKE.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.635
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE SITTING

02:14.635 --> 02:16.670
NEXT TO COUSIN ROSA
AT CHRISTMAS DINNER.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.440
SHE FELL IN THE SHOWER,
AND SHE CAN ONLY GRUNT NOW,

02:19.440 --> 02:21.809
SO YOU TWO SHOULD HIT IT OFF.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.779
WELL, AT LEAST HER GRUNTS
WILL MAKE MORE SENSE

02:25.779 --> 02:26.880
THAN YOUR ENGLISH.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.682
WOULD YOU TWO STOP IT?

02:28.682 --> 02:31.252
GEORGE, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A GOOD TIME IN MIAMI.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.554
DADDY, COME HELP ME
FINISH THE TREE.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.692
MAN, THIS CHRISTMAS
IS GONNA BE HELL.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.728
ALL HER SNOBBY RELATIVES
ARE GONNA TREAT ME LIKE CRAP.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.263
SO WHAT IF I DIDN'T
GO TO COLLEGE?

02:42.263 --> 02:43.764
SO WHAT IF I WORK
IN A FACTORY?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.766
DOES THAT MAKE ME
LESS IMPORTANT

02:45.766 --> 02:48.236
THAN SOME SENATOR,
A JUDGE OR A DOCTOR?

02:48.236 --> 02:50.571
HEY, WE'RE ALL EQUAL
IN GOD'S EYES.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.706
Ã³RALE, DALAI LAMA!

02:55.709 --> 02:59.112
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GOIN'.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.716
BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS.
YOU GOTTA BE WITH YOUR FAMILY.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.252
THEY'LL HAVE A BETTER TIME
WITHOUT ME.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.653
ANGIE'LL BE
WITH HER RELATIVES,

03:05.653 --> 03:07.588
AND EVERYBODY WILL BE HAPPY
TO SEE THE KIDS.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.923
THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANGIE'S
GONNA BE COOL WITH THIS.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.725
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY
I'M GONNA TELL HER

03:11.725 --> 03:15.296
THE POWERS BROTHERS ARE MAKING
ME WORK ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.798
YOU'RE GONNA LIE
TO YOUR WIFE ON CHRISTMAS?!

03:17.798 --> 03:18.866
SHH!

03:18.866 --> 03:20.701
DUDE, THAT'S COLD.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.904
CHRISTMAS WAS BUILT ON LIES
TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.773
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

03:25.773 --> 03:27.241
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS
IT'S PROBABLY TIME

03:27.241 --> 03:28.709
WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION.
SIT DOWN.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.646
YOU KNOW HOW EVERY YEAR,
YOU GIVE ME YOUR GIFT FIRST?

03:32.646 --> 03:33.447
MM-HMM.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.715
AND THEN, SECONDS LATER,

03:34.715 --> 03:37.084
I END UP GIVING YOU
THE EXACT SAME GIFT?

03:37.084 --> 03:39.953
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.989
I GOT YOUR CHRISTMAS GIFT.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.190
WATCH OUT.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.493
TWO FREE ROUNDS OF GOLF
AT OCEAN PINES.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.595
WHAT, THAT NEW PLACE?
YEAH.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.530
MAN, THIS IS GREAT!

03:49.530 --> 03:52.800
(laughs)
WHAT'D YOU GET ME?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.935
YOU KNOW, MAN,
THIS IS WEIRD.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.671
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE SAME AS LAST YEAR,

03:57.671 --> 03:59.973
LIKE, THERE'S SOME STRANGE
CONNECTION BETWEEN US.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.775
REALLY?
HANG ON.

04:06.614 --> 04:10.818
I GOT YOU A FREE ROUND OF GOLF
AT OCEAN PINES!

04:10.818 --> 04:14.121
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T GET
THE TWO-FOR-ONE DEAL?

04:14.121 --> 04:17.291
YOU DON'T USE DISCOUNTS
ON GIFTS. IT CHEAPENS IT.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.760
OH.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.761
COME ON.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.730
OH, GOD, DUDE,
I FEEL TERRIBLE, MAN.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.765
HERE, YOU SHOULD
HAVE THIS BACK.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.968
ALL RIGHT, WELL, AS ALONG AS
YOU LEARNED A LESSON.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.970
YEAH.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.375
(footsteps approach)

04:34.375 --> 04:36.810
DAMN IT, JACK,
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

04:36.810 --> 04:39.179
HOW CAN YOU MAKE ME WORK
ON CHRISTMAS EVE?

04:39.179 --> 04:41.449
I'M GOING TO MIAMI
WITH MY FAMILY,

04:41.449 --> 04:43.517
AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT
YOU CAN SAY--

04:43.517 --> 04:45.386
OH, IT'S YOU.
WHERE THE HELL IS YOUR MOM?

04:45.386 --> 04:47.555
SHE'S COMING.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.825
IS YOUR SUITCASE EMPTY?

04:51.825 --> 04:54.962
NO, UM, IT'S HOT IN MIAMI.
ALL MY CLOTHES ARE LINEN.

04:56.430 --> 05:00.534
BUT IT REALLY FEELS LIKE
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.804
UNTIL YOU GOTTA TAKE A TEST,
HUH? GET IN THE CAR.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.106
DAMN IT, JACK,
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

05:06.106 --> 05:08.008
HOW CAN YOU MAKE ME
WORK ON CHRISTMAS EVE?

05:08.008 --> 05:10.444
I AM GOING TO MIAMI
WITH MY FAMILY,

05:10.444 --> 05:12.446
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN SAY--

05:12.446 --> 05:15.749
WHERE THE HELL
IS YOUR MOM?!

05:15.749 --> 05:19.520
SHE'S COMING.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.022
GOD, DO YOU EVEN HAVE
ANYTHING IN HERE?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.357
ARE YOU CRAZY, CARMEN?

05:23.357 --> 05:25.459
NOW WHEN SECURITY ASKS ME
IF ANYBODY HANDLED MY BAG,

05:25.459 --> 05:26.894
I HAVE TO SAY "YES."

05:26.894 --> 05:29.830
YOU PUT THE WHOLE TRIP
IN JEOPARDY. GET IN THE CAR.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.300
THESE KIDS,
YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOTHIN'

05:33.300 --> 05:34.668
WITHOUT TOUCHIN' EVERYTHING,

05:34.668 --> 05:35.869
(footsteps approach)

05:35.869 --> 05:37.571
DAMN IT, JACK,
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

05:37.571 --> 05:39.573
HOW CAN YOU MAKE ME WORK
ON CHRISTMAS EVE?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.575
I AM GOING TO MIAMI
WITH MY FAMILY,

05:41.575 --> 05:44.077
AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU
CAN SAY THAT WILL STOP ME!

05:44.077 --> 05:45.613
EXCEPT THAT.

05:45.613 --> 05:49.049
I DIDN'T KNOW
PEOPLE'S JOBS WERE IN DANGER.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.385
WELL, THIS IS UNEXPECTED--
ALL RIGHT.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.854
I'LL BE THERE--ALL RIGHT!

05:53.854 --> 05:55.823
I'LL BE THERE.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.491
GOD!

05:57.491 --> 05:59.092
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:59.092 --> 06:04.097
YOU DIDN'T GET IT FROM THAT?

06:04.097 --> 06:06.099
WHAT?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.936
I CAN'T GO TO MIAMI, ANGIE.
I GOTTA WORK!

06:08.936 --> 06:12.272
ON CHRISTMAS EVE? NO. NO WAY.
I'M CALLING JACK.

06:12.272 --> 06:16.043
NO, HE SAID THAT THERE WAS A BIG
SCREWUP WITH THE BOEING ORDER,

06:16.043 --> 06:18.311
AND IF WE DON'T
GET THIS STUFF OUT,

06:18.311 --> 06:20.147
WE'RE GONNA LOSE
THE CONTRACT

06:20.147 --> 06:22.450
AND PEOPLE ARE
GONNA GET LAID OFF!
THIS SUCKS.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.685
I KNOW, BUT WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.687
I GUESS I HAVE TO CALL
AUNT CLAUDIA

06:26.687 --> 06:29.690
AND TELL HER THAT
WE CAN'T COME TO MIAMI.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.092
IF YOU HAVE TO WORK, THEN WE'RE
GONNA STAY HERE WITH YOU.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.763
NO, ANGIE, LOOK, I DON'T WANT
YOU TO MISS YOUR FAMILY REUNION.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.931
JUST BECAUSE MY CHRISTMAS
IS GONNA BE RUINED

06:37.931 --> 06:40.668
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOURS SHOULD BE.

06:43.236 --> 06:47.808
GEORGE LOPEZ,
SOMETIMES YOU SURPRISE ME.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.610
JUST WHEN I WAS ABOUT
TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU

06:49.610 --> 06:53.080
ABOUT BEING SELFISH,
YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.752
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE HOLIDAYS.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.454
WE SHOULDN'T BE CRITICAL
OF EACH OTHER.

07:00.454 --> 07:05.826
WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW JUDGMENTAL
YOU ARE AFTER THE NEW YEAR.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.227
UNLESS YOU CAN
WORK ON IT BY THEN,

07:07.227 --> 07:09.997
BUT I'M NOT HOLDING
MY BREATH.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.033
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.935
I MEAN,
SPENDING CHRISTMAS ALONE,

07:14.935 --> 07:16.303
YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
YOUR MOM

07:16.303 --> 07:17.905
BECAUSE SHE'S GAMBLING
IN RENO.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.908
OH, ANGIE, I'M GONNA BE FINE.
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY--

07:20.908 --> 07:23.410
YOU SEEING YOUR FAMILY
ON CHRISTMAS

07:23.410 --> 07:27.080
IS MY GIFT TO YOU, HUH?
LET'S OPEN IT TOGETHER.

07:27.080 --> 07:32.152
THIS IS A REALLY SWEET THING
YOU'RE DOING.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.021
MWAH.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.656
JUST KNOW THE WHOLE TIME
YOU'RE GONE,

07:35.656 --> 07:37.457
I'LL BE THINKING OF YOU,
BABY, OKAY?

07:37.457 --> 07:41.529
BYE.
I MISS YOU ALREADY.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.875
MOM SAID YOU HAD
THE TICKETS.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.445
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR GOLF CLUB?

07:58.445 --> 07:59.947
I'M THROWIN' A TANTRUM

07:59.947 --> 08:01.949
'CAUSE I CAN'T BE
WITH MY FAMILY ON CHRISTMAS!

08:01.949 --> 08:04.384
WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER?
WHY ME?!

08:04.384 --> 08:08.155
IT'LL BE OKAY, DAD.
THANKS. I NEVER
THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.157
YOU BETTER GO NOW, MAX,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.893
BECAUSE I FEEL THE DARKNESS
COMING BACK, OKAY?

08:12.893 --> 08:16.496
BE A GOOD BOY, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY, BYE-BYE NOW.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.935
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

08:25.405 --> 08:27.274
* ALL MY FRIENDS

08:27.274 --> 08:30.844
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

08:32.445 --> 08:34.214
* THE LOW RIDER

08:34.214 --> 08:37.284
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

08:49.496 --> 08:52.432
THEN I PLAYED
A LITTLE GOLF,

08:52.432 --> 08:53.934
WENT TO A MOVIE,
SMOKED A CIGAR

08:53.934 --> 08:55.535
AND ORGANIZED ALL THE TOOLS
IN MY GARAGE.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.304
ASK ME WHERE MY HAMMER IS.
WHERE?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.607
BY THE FRONT DOOR RIGHT THERE
WITH THE LITTLE OUTLINE. BLACK.

08:59.607 --> 09:04.477
(laughs) DAMN,
YOU GOT A LOT DONE.
FINISH IT UP.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME,

09:04.477 --> 09:06.479
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.882
IT'S ONLY 6.
WHY ARE THEY CLOSING?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.350
DUDE, IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.252
EVERYBODY'S GOTTA GO HOME
TO THEIR FAMILIES.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.553
NOT US. WE'RE GOIN' OUT!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.823
TWO BACHELORS,
JUST LIKE BACK IN THE DAY!

09:15.823 --> 09:18.425
ACTUALLY, I CAN'T.
I GOTTA GO TO BAKERSFIELD.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.128
WE'RE GONNA SPEND CHRISTMAS
WITH MY TIA LENCHA.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.163
WHAT, LENCHA?

09:23.163 --> 09:24.832
WASN'T SHE THAT TEACHER
THAT GOT FIRED

09:24.832 --> 09:27.434
FOR HAVIN' AN AFFAIR
WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD STUDENT?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.436
YEAH,
BUT IT'S NOT THAT WEIRD.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.238
YOU KNOW,
HE'S TALL FOR HIS AGE

09:31.238 --> 09:35.142
AND SHE REALLY DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE SHE'S IN HER 50s.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.377
I BET THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE GOT CAUGHT

09:37.377 --> 09:38.779
IF SHE HADN'T HAVE
GONE TO THE PROM.

09:38.779 --> 09:42.616
YEAH. YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT
HERE BY YOURSELF?

09:42.616 --> 09:44.051
ME? ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:44.051 --> 09:46.019
YOU KNOW MY MOM NEVER
CELEBRATED CHRISTMAS.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.289
I'M USED TO SPENDING IT ALONE.
I KINDA LIKE IT NOW.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.158
OKAY, THEN. I'M GOING.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.660
ALL RIGHT.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.198
YOU SURE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

09:58.198 --> 10:01.134
YEAH, MAN, I'M GONNA BE FINE.
NOW GET OUTTA HERE.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.402
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, MERRY CHRISTMAS.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.637
OKAY, MERRY CHRISTMAS.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.038
HEY, CALL ME ALL YOU WANT

10:05.038 --> 10:08.175
BECAUSE I GOT A LOT OF
HOLIDAY MINUTES.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.311
SERIOUSLY, MAN, WE'RE CLOSED.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.813
OKAY, I'M OUTTA HERE.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.548
HEY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT
DOIN' ANYTHING,

10:15.548 --> 10:16.717
MAYBE YOU WANT TO GO
CATCH A MOVIE?

10:16.717 --> 10:17.985
MOVIE? IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.153
I'M SPENDING IT
WITH MY FAMILY.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.722
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYONE?

10:21.722 --> 10:24.191
YEAH, BUT I LIED AND SAID
THAT I HAD TO WORK

10:24.191 --> 10:25.793
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND TIME
WITH MY WIFE'S FAMILY.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.194
THEY LOOK DOWN ON ME.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.662
I WONDER WHY THEY LOOK DOWN
ON A LIAR

10:28.662 --> 10:30.864
WHO SPENDS CHRISTMAS EVE
IN A BAR.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.969
ALL RIGHT, THE TRUTH IS
I'M A CHRISTMAS ANGEL

10:35.969 --> 10:37.971
SENT DOWN HERE TO SEE
IF YOU'D BE KIND TO A STRANGER

10:37.971 --> 10:39.673
AND GUESS WHAT? YOU FAILED.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.244
SO GOOD LUCK DRIVING HOME
ON THE ICY ROADS TONIGHT.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.612
THIS IS L.A.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.948
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS L.A.,

10:47.948 --> 10:49.717
THE CITY OF ANGELS,

10:49.717 --> 10:54.187
WHERE MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN FOR
THOSE WHO BELIEVE. WATCH OUT.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.723
(glasses clink)

10:57.557 --> 10:58.992
WANT ME TO CALL YOU A CAB?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.427
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.302
(door opens and closes)

11:19.379 --> 11:21.849
AAH!
AAH!

11:21.849 --> 11:26.086
JEEZ. YOU SCARED
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.588
MA, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GAMBLING.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.557
OH, I GOT KICKED OUT
OF THE CASINO.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.025
APPARENTLY, TONY ORLANDO

11:32.025 --> 11:35.295
DOESN'T LIKE TO HAVE
PANTIES THROWN AT HIM.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.264
YOU WENT TO
A TONY ORLANDO CONCERT?

11:37.264 --> 11:40.033
NO.
HE WAS PLAYING BLACKJACK.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.469
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HOME?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.171
I DIDN'T GO TO MIAMI.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.638
HEY, LOOK,
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,

11:45.638 --> 11:46.774
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STEAL
MY TEQUILA.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.275
WHY DON'T WE JUST HANG OUT?

11:48.275 --> 11:51.611
OH, WOW, GEORGE,
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN,

11:51.611 --> 11:53.814
BUT, UM, I GOTTA
GET TO WORK.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.016
I'M YOUR BOSS.
I KNOW THE FACTORY'S CLOSED.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.550
YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.852
DO I HAVE TO MAKE UP
ANOTHER ONE,

11:58.852 --> 12:02.289
OR ARE YOU GONNA LET ME
OFF THE HOOK?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.291
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
SPEND THE HOLIDAYS TOGETHER

12:04.291 --> 12:06.493
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME
FOR ONCE?

12:06.493 --> 12:08.228
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT, GEORGE.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.163
I'M JUST GONNA GO GET
SOME SMOKES OUT OF THE CAR

12:10.163 --> 12:13.333
AND WE'LL FINALLY HAVE
THAT CHRISTMAS YOU WANTED.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.071
I'M-A HEAR YOUR CAR PEELING OUT,
AREN'T I?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.740
GEORGE, PLEASE,
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.177
I'M JUST GONNA COAST DOWN
THE HILL AND POP THE CLUTCH.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.214
YOU WON'T HEAR A THING.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.756
MERRY CHRISTMAS, MOMMY.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.280
(door opens)

13:05.986 --> 13:08.655
ANGIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

13:08.655 --> 13:11.191
SHH! CARMEN'S SLEEPING.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.794
BEFORE YOU GET MAD,
THE TREE WAS HALF PRICE.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.265
I TOLD YOU, WE DON'T HAVE MONEY
TO WASTE ON A CHRISTMAS TREE!

13:18.265 --> 13:20.133
WELL, I'M SORRY. THIS IS WHAT
NORMAL PEOPLE DO ON CHRISTMAS.

13:20.133 --> 13:24.137
MY MOM USED TO HAVE A TREE
IN EVERY ROOM

13:24.137 --> 13:26.139
AND DECORATE EACH ONE
WITH A DIFFERENT THEME.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.474
WELL, WE WERE POOR,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.309
SO WE HAD OUR OWN
CHRISTMAS TRADITIONS.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.544
EVERY CHRISTMAS EVE,
I'D SNEAK INTO THE LIVING ROOM

13:31.544 --> 13:33.146
AND HANG MY SOCK
ON THE FIREPLACE...

13:33.146 --> 13:34.647
OH.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.284
THEN MY SHIRT AND MY PANTS
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A DRYER.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.921
HONEY, I KNOW.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.389
I KNOW YOU HAD IT ROUGH,

13:42.389 --> 13:46.459
BUT IT'S TIME TO START
OUR OWN TRADITIONS.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.561
IT'S YOUR DAUGHTER'S
FIRST CHRISTMAS.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.963
WE SHOULD MAKE IT SPECIAL.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.731
SHE'S NOT GONNA REMEMBER
ANY OF THIS, ANGIE.

13:51.731 --> 13:54.167
SHE'S 3 MONTHS OLD.
SHE HASN'T EVEN SMILED YET.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.336
OH, SO CHRISTMAS MEANS
NOTHING TO YOU?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.371
NO. IT MEANS DOUBLE TIME
AT THE FACTORY.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.273
THAT'S WHY I SIGNED ON
FOR ANOTHER SHIFT.

14:00.273 --> 14:04.477
YOU'RE WORKING ON
CHRISTMAS EVE?!

14:04.477 --> 14:05.812
(baby Carmen cries)

14:05.812 --> 14:09.516
OH, SHH.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.186
IT'S OKAY, CARMEN.
COME HERE. OHH.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.057
OH, COME HERE. SHH.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.529
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY. SHH.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.565
HERE, LET ME TRY.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.739
THIS IS NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE ON CHRISTMAS.

14:32.739 --> 14:37.277
WE SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING.
THE BABY SHOULDN'T BE CRYING.
ANGIE.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.946
YOU SHOULD WANT TO BE
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.547
ANGIE, LOOK.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.614
WHAT?

14:41.614 --> 14:43.383
ANGIE, CARMEN'S SMILING.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.221
IT'S HER FIRST SMILE.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.590
SHE LIKES THE LIGHTS.

14:50.590 --> 14:55.428
THAT, OR IT'S GAS.
NO, IT'S THE LIGHTS.

14:55.428 --> 15:00.900
I'M SO HAPPY WE WERE ABLE TO SEE
HER FIRST SMILE TOGETHER.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.036
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M-A CALL THE FACTORY

15:03.036 --> 15:05.038
AND GET OUT OF MY SHIFT.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.241
I WANT TO BE WITH MY FAMILY
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.978
HEY, GIRL, HEY...

15:14.514 --> 15:17.517
I'M OKAY.
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

15:17.517 --> 15:21.288
I LIKE BEING ALONE.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.256
(carolers) * JINGLE BELLS

15:23.256 --> 15:25.959
* JINGLE BELLS,
JINGLE ALL THE WAY... *

15:25.959 --> 15:28.895
CAROLERS! YES! PEOPLE!

15:28.895 --> 15:33.433
* JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS,
JINGLE ALL THE WAY *

15:33.433 --> 15:37.604
* OH, WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE
* IN A ONE-HORSE--

15:40.240 --> 15:42.109
WHY DID YOU GUYS STOP?
COME ON IN, EVERYBODY!

15:42.109 --> 15:43.476
WE CAN ALL SING ONE TOGETHER!
I'LL BE LIKE,

15:43.476 --> 15:46.313
* JINGLE BELLS,
JINGLE BELLS... *

15:46.313 --> 15:49.416
WE GOT OTHER HOUSES TO GET TO.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.351
LOOK, I'LL MAKE HOT CHOCOLATE
AND GET A CANDY CANE.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.420
WE CAN ALL STIR IT.
COME ON!

15:53.420 --> 15:56.523
KIDS, GET IN THE VAN.
THIS IS NOT A DRILL!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.529
WHERE YOU GUYS GOING?

16:04.764 --> 16:06.966
I'LL PUT PANTS ON!

16:11.138 --> 16:13.573
FINE! BE LIKE THAT!
I DON'T NEED YOU.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.411
I'M NOT ALONE!
I GOT TV!

16:18.411 --> 16:21.281
TV's ALL I'VE EVER HAD
AND TV's ALL I EVER NEEDED.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.650
IT ALWAYS CHEERS ME UP.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.985
(man) DO HOLIDAYS
MAKE YOU DEPRESSED?

16:25.985 --> 16:29.422
OH, SHUT UP.

16:37.697 --> 16:42.802
ONE FINAL TOUCH, AND I'LL HAVE
A FRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.204
OH, NO!

16:44.204 --> 16:47.040
I CAN'T DO NOTHING!

16:47.040 --> 16:48.408
PERFECT TIMING.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.577
MY SCOTCH WAS GETTING WARM.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.612
WHY YOU CRYING?

16:52.612 --> 16:58.151
I MADE A BIG, STUPID MISTAKE
THIS MORNING.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.555
COME ON, GEORGE!

17:02.555 --> 17:05.658
THE WHOLE FAMILY IS GONNA
HELP SANTA DELIVER TOYS.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.795
UH, SORRY, BUT I HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.930
YOU KNOW, PUT THE TOOLS AWAY
IN THE TOY SHOP,

17:10.930 --> 17:13.566
CLEAN OUT THE REINDEER BARN.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.635
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SANTA'S
FEEDING BLITZEN,

17:15.635 --> 17:17.504
BUT I KNOW HOW
HE GOT HIS NAME.

17:17.504 --> 17:22.809
BUCKLE UP, MY POINTED-EARED
FRIENDS. IT'S SHOW TIME!

17:22.809 --> 17:24.311
HO-HO-HO!
BYE, HONEY!

17:24.311 --> 17:26.045
BYE, DAD! BYE!
BYE, DAD! BYE!

17:26.045 --> 17:30.016
I LIED BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT'D BE FUN

17:30.016 --> 17:33.253
TO SMOKE CIGARS
AND HANG OUT BY MYSELF,

17:33.253 --> 17:36.856
BUT NOW I'M LONELY.
WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND?

17:36.856 --> 17:40.127
NO. I HAVE A DATE WITH
A BIG JOLLY GUY IN A RED SUIT

17:40.127 --> 17:42.061
WHO LIKES ME TO BOUNCE
ON HIS LAP.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.364
BUT SANTA'S OUT
DELIVERING PRESENTS.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.066
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT SANTA?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.969
WHOO!

17:49.969 --> 17:53.940
* ALL ALONE ON CHRISTMAS EVE

17:53.940 --> 17:58.978
* WHY'D I LET MY FAMILY LEAVE?

17:58.978 --> 18:01.414
* 'TIS A SEASON WITHOUT GLEE

18:01.414 --> 18:07.287
* WOE IS, WOE IS, WOE IS ME

18:21.701 --> 18:26.139
HELLO? I NEED TO BE
ON THE FIRST FLIGHT TO MIAMI.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.507
I KNOW IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE!

18:27.507 --> 18:30.410
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT COSTS, OKAY?

18:30.410 --> 18:33.012
FIRST CLASS, FULL PRICE,
WHATEVER.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.682
I JUST NEED TO SEE
MY FAMILY.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.584
HOW MUCH?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.621
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT MY MOM DIED

18:41.621 --> 18:43.956
AND I'M GOING TO HER FUNERAL?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.726
IT'S STILL THAT MUCH?

18:46.726 --> 18:51.130
UH, ACTUALLY, I JUST NEED
TO SEND MY MOM'S GREAT DANE

18:51.130 --> 18:52.665
TO THE FUNERAL.

18:52.665 --> 18:56.135
YOU DON'T LOOK
IN THOSE CRATES, DO YOU?

18:59.939 --> 19:03.843
HERE'S MY DEATH CERTIFICATE.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.879
I HAVE TO SAY I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD SEE MY SON

19:06.879 --> 19:11.184
TRY TO GET A CHEAPER AIRLINE
TICKET WITH A FUNERAL SCAM.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.223
I'M PROUD OF YOU, GEORGE.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.558
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS,
ANYWAY?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.092
OH, I GOT IT WHEN
I WENT TO GRACELAND.

19:20.092 --> 19:24.264
I JUST WHITED OUT
ELVIS' NAME.

19:24.264 --> 19:28.201
(imitating Elvis)
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAMA.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.239
HEY, HONEY.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.406
ANGIE!

19:33.406 --> 19:35.007
(all) MERRY CHRISTMAS!

19:35.007 --> 19:36.243
OH, MY GOD!
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

19:36.243 --> 19:38.678
YOU GUYS ARE HOME!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

19:38.678 --> 19:40.447
OH, I WANTED TO CALL YOU
FROM THE AIRPORT,

19:40.447 --> 19:42.482
BUT THE KIDS WANTED
TO SURPRISE YOU.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.651
LOOK, AND I WAS GONNA
SURPRISE YOU GUYS, TOO.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.919
I WAS GONNA FLY TO MIAMI 'CAUSE
I MISSED YOU GUYS SO MUCH,

19:46.919 --> 19:49.589
THEN YOU LEFT AND THE PENGUIN
WENT TO SLEEP WITH SANTA

19:49.589 --> 19:52.659
AND THE CAROLERS CAME OVER,
BUT I WASN'T WEARING ANY PANTS.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.462
OH, MY GOD. THIS IS
GRANDMA'S DEATH CERTIFICATE.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.798
DAD KILLED GRANDMA,
NOW HE'S DRUNK AND CELEBRATING!

19:58.798 --> 20:01.634
NO, I WAS GONNA USE IT
TO GET A CHEAPER FLIGHT,

20:01.634 --> 20:04.304
BUT I REALIZED THAT I NEVER
WANT TO SPEND CHRISTMAS

20:04.304 --> 20:05.938
WITHOUT MY FAMILY AGAIN...

20:05.938 --> 20:07.474
AND THE BEAUTIFUL THING IS

20:07.474 --> 20:10.310
THAT YOU ALL FELT THE SAME WAY
AND FLEW ALL THE WAY BACK

20:10.310 --> 20:12.312
JUST TO BE WITH ME.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.514
OR THERE WAS A STORM
IN CHICAGO,

20:14.514 --> 20:16.549
AND OUR FLIGHT TO MIAMI
WAS CANCELED.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.850
MAX!

20:17.850 --> 20:20.119
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THIS WAS MEANT TO BE.

20:20.119 --> 20:23.523
THIS IS
OUR CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!

20:25.191 --> 20:27.760
THE LOPEZ FAMILY'S
BACK TOGETHER.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.897
SANTA, YOU CAN STOP
THE STORM IN CHICAGO. OVER.

20:32.799 --> 20:38.371
DAMN IT. COVER BLOWN.
CODE RED. GET ME OUT!

20:43.676 --> 20:47.380
YOU NEVER LEAVE A MAN BEHIND!
