Excuse me.
Just a minute.

Ma’am, this woman is asleep
next to me, and I really
have to get out.

00:36.495 --> 00:40.238
It’sjust that this book is so exciting.
Do you like mysteries?

00:40.333 --> 00:43.621
Well, I’m an FBI. agent.
So mysteries are
sort of my thing.

Why does whatever’s going on
between Roxie and Angela matter to you?

Because Angela and I
were engaged.

over Greenland.
Can we land there to refuel?

worry. They have cops there. Lots of them.

Um, two people,
they go away together,

10:22.039 --> 10:24.655
and they pack one bag—
that means something, right?

10:24.750 --> 10:27.833
You mean Angela and Roxie?

10:29.421 --> 10:31.912
Well—

10:32.007 --> 10:34.714
Yeah, it means something.

10:42.017 --> 10:45.134
Excuse me.
What’s going on?

10:45.229 --> 10:48.062
Listen. Would you happen
to have a measuring tape
and tweezers?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.059
[Gasps]
There’s been a murder!

10:50.192 --> 10:52.774

tweezers for an autopsy.
Shh! N0!

10:52.903 --> 10:56.236
Code red. Code red.
Shh! No code red.
Don’t wake Nadine up.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.234
I will explain everything to you later.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.318
I promise, Charlotte. Ijust need
those things. Do you have ’em?

11:02.412 --> 11:05.950
Well, I didn’t hear a gunshot,
so it must’ve been a knifing.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.283
/ sa w Dr. Temperance Brennan,
the mystery writer, in first class.

11:09.378 --> 11:12.040
/ bet she’s doing the autopsy
Listen.

11:12.130 --> 11:16.248
I was awake the whole time.
And anyone who went that way,
they came back again.

11:16.343 --> 11:20.006
So ifthe victim is a passenger,
he or she is in first class.

11:20.097 --> 11:23.009
Probably she, because most
murder victims are women.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.591
Wow. You really are
into murder, aren’t you?

11:26.979 --> 11:29.721
Okay, thanks.
Wait!

11:29.857 --> 11:32.473
Dr. Brennan will need this.
What’s that for?

11:32.568 --> 11:34.980
It’s a probe.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.446
This is the best flight
I’ve ever been on.

11:44.705 --> 11:48.038
Okay, sweetie, we ’Ve got
a solid link here, aud/o/ visual.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.333
So you should be able to beam us
all the digital photographs you can.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.331
Okay, we’ve isolated
the crime scene.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.835
And we’ll try to compromise
the forensics as little as possible.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.379
Look what I got.
Oh, a probe.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.797
That’s great.
I didn’t think ofthat.
Yeah, lucky I did.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.507
- Hey, Booth. Good ﬂight so far?
- I’m having trouble sleeping.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.468
Looks like you managed to get
the remains out ofthe oven.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.554
Yeah, They’re, uh, kind of, uh—
Well, they— they—

12:11.648 --> 12:13.900
The y’ve fallen apart
a little bit there.

12:13.984 --> 12:17.101
Hey, Bones. Did you knock
the phone off this cradle?

12:17.195 --> 12:18.935
No.

12:23.702 --> 12:27.160
I’ve informed the FAA, the N.T.S.B. and
the Chinese we have a dead body on board.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.614
- Who else has access
to the galley down there?
- All of us.

12:30.709 --> 12:34.122
it’s kind of our geta way place,
to chill out from passengers.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.586
Who was the last person who made a call
from the satellite phone
down there?

12:36.673 --> 12:39.415
- I can get you the number called.
- It— It was me.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.420
[Booth]
You? What are you?

12:41.511 --> 12:44.093
A spy or a smuggler?
No.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.422
She’s in love, Agent Booth.

12:46.516 --> 12:50.054
And her boyfriend works for this
airline at the Shanghai airport.

12:50.187 --> 12:53.930
It’s against the rules.
So is having sex with
passengers in the bathroom.

12:55.484 --> 12:59.147
Okay / think we ’re all
under a lot of stress here.

12:59.237 --> 13:02.946
I used the phone right after dinner.
There was no dead body
cooking in the microwave.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.149

26:24.167 --> 26:27.625
I can report electrical issues.
Maybe give you an extra hour.

26:27.712 --> 26:30.920
Great. I’ll take that as a sign
of cooperation, Captain.

26:31.007 --> 26:34.124
[ Si ghs ]
It’s a beautiful view.
Look at that.

26:35.845 --> 26:38.712
How long do I have
to stay here?

26:38.806 --> 26:41.593
I was interested
in some ofthe things
you were saying earlier.

26:41.684 --> 26:44.175
Hey, I answered every question
the scary woman asked me.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.808
Yeah. Well, the thing is,
she’s a lawyer.
So she’s very direct.

26:47.940 --> 26:51.103
Scary.
She has a knack for putting
people into federal prison.

26:51.194 --> 26:55.312
I believe she likes to do it.
I have a more
psychological mojo.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.522
You don’t look like
you have a mojo.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.610
I’m interested in what you know
about Elizabethjones’s personal life.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.242
[Scoffs]

27:06.459 --> 27:08.871
I did not have sex
with that woman.

27:09.003 --> 27:12.291
But you wanted to.
Yeah, but I didn’t.

27:12.423 --> 27:16.132
Was she the type
to have affairs?
Yes.

27:16.219 --> 27:18.881
Have you got a name?

27:18.971 --> 27:21.713
I could go get MissJulian again
ifyou’re more comfortable with her.

27:21.849 --> 27:25.467
Artie.
All I know is Artie.
Artie. Okay.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.893
Well, let’s talk
about Elizabeth and Artie.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.517
Now, how resentful were you...

27:30.608 --> 27:34.021
that Elizabeth slept with him
and not with you?

27:35.404 --> 27:37.941
Well, he’s married.
I’m not.

27:38.032 --> 27:41.524
So, yeah.
Maybe I’m a little resentful.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.370
It’s a Band-Aid.

27:50.461 --> 27:54.170
Oh, yeah. Thanks.
I was totally flummoxed.

27:54.257 --> 27:56.589
So the clean part here
must be where it overlapped.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.509
And then the darker part must
be where it came in contact
with the skin.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.506
I’m not an expert,
but I’m pretty sure...

28:01.597 --> 28:04.805
even you can’t get
a DNA. result from
a digital photograph.

28:04.892 --> 28:08.430
No. But what about
a finger size?
Oh.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.763
Wow. Right.
That’s kind of brilliant.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.810
Eighty-two millimeters
in circumference.
All right.

28:13.943 --> 28:16.855
[Beeping]
Well, mine’s 62.

28:16.946 --> 28:19.028
So it’s a pretty big guy.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.408
Or overweight.
Look at the perforations.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.071
Vertical stretching
along the pad.
I see it.

28:24.161 --> 28:26.743
But I have no idea what it means.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.867
It was locked
in a bent position.

28:28.958 --> 28:32.041
Oh, that would explain
the creases.

28:32.128 --> 28:35.120
So if/ highlight the parts
where the adhesive wore oﬂ,r

28:35.214 --> 28:37.296
it was bent more than 90 degrees.

28:37.383 --> 28:42.594
I really love...
working with you.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.844
Me too. We’re really
good together...

28:47.977 --> 28:49.808
at these things.

28:49.896 --> 28:52.137
Yeah.

28:56.652 --> 29:00.520
I gotta ask you
something, Angela.
Yeah.

29:00.615 --> 29:03.231
I got that from
the fast double back.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.817
This thing with Roxie.

29:05.953 --> 29:09.821
It’s real. Yeah.
No, | get that.
I see that.

29:09.957 --> 29:12.369
Is that what got between us?
I’d love to say yes to that.

29:12.460 --> 29:15.623
Because I think it would
make you feel better.

29:15.713 --> 29:18.830
But you can fall
in love with a man?

29:18.925 --> 29:22.133

Sweetie. God.

Totally forgot you were there.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.187
I guess you heard
everything, huh?

29:38.277 --> 29:40.609
Yes. It was fascinating.

29:40.696 --> 29:44.280
- Well, what do you think?
- Well, the onlyjoint that’ll
bend over 90 degrees...

29:44.367 --> 29:47.484
is between the proximal
and intermediate phalanges.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.035
Right.
Finger stuff.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.454
We’re looking for

29:52.541 --> 29:54.998

flexor tenosynovitis.

That’s great, sweetie.
But what about the rest
ofthe conversation?

Oh, I’m sorry, Ange.
I wasn’t paying attention.

- Yes. What we need to do now
is find a passenger...

on their locked proximal

Raise your hands.
1 00k at that, huh?

the number of books we need

- Roast pork.

- Yeah, I love shooting.

Doesn’t mean I’m not a reader.

31:22.715 --> 31:25.502
Tell you what. Why don’t
you come with us. Come on.

named Elizabethjones, no.

Hey, Sweets.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.349
Are you still with
Elizabeth Jones’s editor?
Yes. And I have—

31:35.436 --> 31:37.677
Ask him if he knows someone
by the name of Nick Devito.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.680
Is this, like, a question
to get my free book?
Where’s your Band—Aid?

31:40.775 --> 31:43.767
- Do you know Nick Devito?
- Must have come offwhile I was asleep.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.817
I twitch. I’m twitchy.

31:45.946 --> 31:49.985
I had lunch once
with Danny DeVito.
He says no. I have information.

31:50.076 --> 31:53.739
Elizabeth Jones was having
an affair with a man
known only as Artie.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.740
The relationship’s been
going on for over a year.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.696
But it went bad
in the last month or so.

31:57.792 --> 32:01.125
He’s married. His wife is sick.
And his kid is a pain in the ass.

You know what, Sweets?
You are the man of the hour.

32:04.924 --> 32:08.257
I owe you a beer
and a rye chaser, my friend.

32:08.344 --> 32:10.380
That sounds like it
would make me sick.

32:10.513 --> 32:12.799

You can go back to your seat.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.381
Why?

32:15.476 --> 32:19.060
Well, we have
a much better suspect.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.549
I think you know
why I’m here.

32:47.633 --> 32:51.467
Look, I’m sorry about my son.
He’s a teenager.
His mother’s very ill.

32:51.554 --> 32:54.842
It’s not about your son,
Artie.

32:54.932 --> 32:57.423
it’s about Elizabeth jones.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.850
My wife doesn’t know about E].
I would like to keep it that way.

33:07.945 --> 33:10.482
Did Elizabeth Jones ask you
to leave your wife?

33:10.573 --> 33:13.360
From the very beginning,
I told Elizabeth
that would never happen.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.692
You see the shape that
Ann’s in? My first priority
right now...

33:16.787 --> 33:18.368
is to be a good husband
and a good father.

33:18.455 --> 33:20.366
By dragging a dying woman
to China?

33:20.457 --> 33:23.995
No. To stand on the Great Wall
ofChina has been Ann’s dream
since she was a little girl.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.793
Our last chance
to do something amazing
as a family together.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.872
So Elizabethjones
followed you?

33:28.966 --> 33:30.627
Obviously.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.887
And you killed her?
Of course not.

33:33.971 --> 33:36.178
Excuse me.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.881
I am a lawyer.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.718
Hmm. Your wife
didn’t know about her?

33:41.812 --> 33:43.973
She knows that
there was someone.

33:44.106 --> 33:46.563
Did you talk
to Elizabeth?
Yes.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.687
I begged her
to leave us alone.
Ann was asleep.

33:49.778 --> 33:53.646
As I said, Agent Booth,
I’m an attorney.

33:53.741 --> 33:56.357
You have no evidence
and very little time
before we land in Shanghai.

33:56.452 --> 34:01.116
Ifyou want to find out who
killed E.J., | suggest you not
waste any more time with me.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.874
I enhanced the photographs
ofthe sternum.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.501
Light was reﬂected
off ofthis area here.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.503
Skin wouldn’t do that.

34:13.594 --> 34:16.085
There were tiny metal shards
embedded in the bone.

34:16.180 --> 34:18.216
And silicon melted
into it as well.

34:18.307 --> 34:22.266
- Fake boobs? How’s that help?
- Silicon, not silicone.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.264
It was a chip of some kind.

34:24.355 --> 34:27.472
A SIM card from a phone,
memory chip from a camera.

34:27.608 --> 34:31.100
But we need to see it
to make a positive I.D.
How did it go with Bilbrey?

34:31.195 --> 34:33.311
He’s an attorney.
He’s not saying much
ofanything.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.272
- And the gun nut, Devito?
- Most likely his Band-Aid...

34:36.367 --> 34:38.278
was stuck to the wheel
ofa food cart.

34:38.369 --> 34:40.405
Find me the smoking gun,
cheri

34:40.496 --> 34:43.579
or that killer disappears into
a billion people when you land.

34:43.666 --> 34:47.500
1.29 billion, approximately.
Are you pressuring us?

34:47.586 --> 34:51.579
- Have a lovely flight.
- I wasjust contacted
by Shanghai International.

34:51.674 --> 34:55.166
They’ve arrested a man named
Felix Clossen, a Dutch national
who works for the airline.

34:55.302 --> 34:58.260
He was passing stolen
credit card numbers.
That’s ﬁasc/nat/ng.

34:58.347 --> 35:00.929
But we’re more interested
in solving a murder
investigation right now.

35:01.016 --> 35:04.133
All the credit card numbers were
from passengers on this plane.

35:04.228 --> 35:06.560
And Clossen is our
flight attendant’s boyfriend.

35:06.647 --> 35:09.639
Ming.

35:09.733 --> 35:14.477
Your call to C lossen was made
within minutes of the victim
being placed in the oven.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.904
- Minutes.
- I got the credit card numbers
offthe computer...

35:17.992 --> 35:20.074
and called them in
to my boyfriend.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.784
And Elizabethjones
caughtyou?
Yes.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.078
- I mean, no.
- Well, which one is it?

35:25.165 --> 35:29.704
I didn’t know who it was.
I heard them coming
and figured it was Kate.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.127
So I hid in the aeronautics
compartment.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.330
Well, who was
with Elizabeth?

35:34.425 --> 35:37.462
/ cou/dn ’t hear because
of the engine noise
in the compartment

35:37.553 --> 35:39.509
All I could see
was their feet.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.133
Well, male or female?
What kind ofshoes?

35:42.224 --> 35:46.467
They were wearing slippers—
the ones we give out
in first class.

35:46.562 --> 35:50.521
They’re all the same.
They walked by me,
and I ran upstairs.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.440
I didn’t kill anyone.

35:55.988 --> 35:59.276
Whoever killed her has to have
traces of blood on their slippers.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.277
That could cause the gun
to smoke for Caroline.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.199
Look, Bones.
You’re gonna need
an A.L.S. light.

36:03.287 --> 36:06.154
Not even those dotty
old mystery buffs carry
that in their giant purses.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.155
We can make one.
How are you gonna make one?

36:08.292 --> 36:11.034
Hope you can do it fast. We’re
gonna be landing very soon.
N o, n o.

36:11.128 --> 36:13.210
You’re not landing this plane
until I tell you
you land this plane.

36:13.297 --> 36:15.379
- Remember, you’re still a suspect.
- It’s not about me or you.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.752
We’re going to run out of fuel
in 20 minutes.

36:24.183 --> 36:27.596
[Brennan ] Okay, Booth,
we need the blue lamp
out of the o verhead projector.

36:30.356 --> 36:34.019
Do you, by any chance,
ha ve an y yel/o w-tin ted
shooting glasses?

36:34.109 --> 36:37.522
Sure. What do you need?
Daylight, artificial light
or moonlight?

36:37.613 --> 36:40.320
Let’s see.

36:40.407 --> 36:44.116
These will do. Thanks.

36:44.203 --> 36:47.787
This is brill/ant. They’re
making an A. LS. emitter.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.615
- What’s that for?
- To find blood.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.826
Ready?
[Brennan]
Got ’em.

36:53.921 --> 36:56.037
Hit the lights.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.668
[ Booth]
Oh.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.715
Easy, Bones.
You see anything?

37:00.803 --> 37:04.216
No. No. Nothing.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.431
[Booth]
What about over here?
Right there?

37:08.519 --> 37:10.259
[Brennan]
No. Nothing.

37:10.354 --> 37:13.187
[Booth]
Oh, geez.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.182
Booth? Over there.
You got something?

37:17.319 --> 37:19.526
Yes, there.
Are you sure?

37:19.613 --> 37:21.695
Yes, Booth.

37:21.782 --> 37:23.647
Turn the lights on.

37:25.411 --> 37:27.402
What is going on, please?

37:27.496 --> 37:30.203
- Your son killed Elizabeth Jones.
- Hey, how long till we land?

37:30.290 --> 37:32.952
- We’re on our final descent.
- Eli? That’s impossible.

37:33.043 --> 37:35.329
Oh, why?
You can’t think ofa motive?
Like maybe he loves his mother?

37:35.421 --> 37:37.503
He wants to keep
his family together?

37:37.589 --> 37:39.580
You probablyjust think
he’s some dumb—ass kid.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.753
[Caroline] I beg your pardon?
Listen, Caroline.
I’m ready to make an arrest.

37:42.845 --> 37:45.587
You’re more than sure,
right, cheri?
You’re damn sure?

37:45.681 --> 37:48.423
Well, it’s circumstantial,
but it’s compelling. So do
you have a warrant to sign?

37:48.559 --> 37:50.470
Yes.
Sign it so I can
make the arrest.

37:50.561 --> 37:53.303
-Just a minute, please.
- [Caroline]
That’s the lawyer, right?

37:53.397 --> 37:56.309
- You can always tell
a damn lawyer.
- I represent my son.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.187
