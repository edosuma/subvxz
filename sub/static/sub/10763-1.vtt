00:12.145 --> 00:13.713
You trying to save Frasier from me

00:13.713 --> 00:15.615
or you trying to save him for yourself?

00:15.615 --> 00:16.604
Are you out of your mind?

00:17.117 --> 00:18.084
Are you in love with him?

00:19.119 --> 00:20.620
Tell me now or I swear to God,

00:20.620 --> 00:23.214
I will walk out of here
and I will not come back!

00:23.390 --> 00:24.624
There's no chance

00:24.624 --> 00:26.092
you'll change your mind, is there?

00:26.092 --> 00:29.152
No, KACL is ancient history,

00:33.099 --> 00:34.067
Niles,,,

00:34.067 --> 00:35.068
I need to talk to you,

00:35.068 --> 00:37.070
You're not with Frasier, are you?

00:37.070 --> 00:39.061
Why does everybody treat us
like we're joined at the hip?

00:39.372 --> 00:42.075
I do have coffee with people
other than my brother, you know?

00:42.075 --> 00:43.376
Good, 'cause I'm avoiding him,

00:43.376 --> 00:44.365
Well, then, talk fast,

00:45.078 --> 00:47.080
He's meeting me in five minutes,

00:47.080 --> 00:48.381
It's about my new job,

00:48.381 --> 00:50.083
It's a nightmare,

00:50.083 --> 00:51.818
Didn't you just start today?

00:51.818 --> 00:53.319
Yes,,, my boss already hit on me,

00:53.319 --> 00:55.810
I'm supposed to work
nights and weekends,

00:56.322 --> 00:58.324
and my assistant is an
idiot and I can't fire her

00:58.324 --> 01:00.815
'cause she's like three
minorities rolled into one,

01:03.329 --> 01:05.331
I can't believe I left KACL

01:05.331 --> 01:06.833
over some stupid snit,

01:06.833 --> 01:08.334
Oh, yes, yes--
your ultimatum,

01:08.334 --> 01:09.836
Frasier told me about that,

01:09.836 --> 01:12.839
Listen, this isn't an easy
subject to broach, but,,,

01:12.839 --> 01:15.341
is it possible you're
in love with Frasier ?

01:15.341 --> 01:17.343
Absolutely not,

01:17.343 --> 01:18.833
You sound sure, I am sure,

01:19.345 --> 01:20.346
If I were going to fall for him,

01:20.346 --> 01:21.347
it would have been two years ago

01:21.347 --> 01:22.336
when we slept together,

01:22.849 --> 01:24.350
Well, another theory
I'd like to explore is,,,

01:24.350 --> 01:25.339
Whoa, back up!

01:28.321 --> 01:30.312
You and Frasier slept together?

01:30.757 --> 01:31.758
He didn't tell you

01:31.758 --> 01:33.191
No,

01:34.694 --> 01:36.696
Well, I suppose it's only natural,

01:36.696 --> 01:38.198
When the wolf and the
lamb work together,

01:38.198 --> 01:40.200
it's only a matter of time
before the wolf gets his way,

01:40.200 --> 01:43.169
I hope you were gentle with him,

01:43.169 --> 01:46.172
Just promise me you
won't tell him I told you,

01:46.172 --> 01:47.173
I promise, I promise,

01:47.173 --> 01:48.675
So,,, you're not in love,

01:48.675 --> 01:50.165
But your behavior last night

01:50.677 --> 01:52.178
clearly indicates some sort of crisis,

01:52.178 --> 01:53.179
As a psychiatrist,,,

01:53.179 --> 01:54.681
I just want my job back,

01:54.681 --> 01:56.171
I'm not looking for some therapy trip,

01:56.683 --> 01:57.672
All right, well,,,

01:58.184 --> 02:00.186
why don't you just sweep
your emotions under the rug

02:00.186 --> 02:01.688
and waltz back to the station

02:01.688 --> 02:03.189
as if nothing ever happened?

02:03.189 --> 02:04.691
That's perfect , Thanks,

02:04.691 --> 02:06.192
No, no,

02:06.192 --> 02:07.694
I was being facetious,

02:07.694 --> 02:08.895
My real advice would be,,, I know,

02:08.895 --> 02:11.498
Talk about my feelings,,,
blah-blah, woof-woof,

02:11.498 --> 02:12.499
I got to go, Niles,

02:12.499 --> 02:13.500
Thanks again,

02:13.500 --> 02:15.502
DAPHNE: Hey, Roz, Hey, Roz,

02:15.502 --> 02:16.503
Hello, darling,

02:16.503 --> 02:18.505
Hey, you,

02:18.505 --> 02:20.507
Well, we're all set,

02:20.507 --> 02:24.210
I got us a home pregnancy
test, a basal body thermometer,

02:24.210 --> 02:25.370
and ovulation kit,

02:25.745 --> 02:27.269
NILES: Perfect,

02:27.313 --> 02:28.381
I can upload all your data

02:28.381 --> 02:30.517
into this fertility program I bought,

02:30.517 --> 02:32.485
You kids sure know how
to keep the romance alive,

02:32.852 --> 02:34.420
Uh, two coffees, please,

02:34.420 --> 02:35.819
Since when do you need

02:36.189 --> 02:38.191
a chemistry set to make a baby?

02:38.191 --> 02:39.659
I hear a "in my day" coming,

02:39.659 --> 02:41.261
In my day, it was simple,

02:41.261 --> 02:43.263
The girl would put on something slinky,

02:43.263 --> 02:45.254
a guy comes home, has a couple of pops

02:45.565 --> 02:47.267
throws some Dean Marti n on the hi-fi,

02:47.267 --> 02:49.258
 and bim-bam-boom--
you're lighting a Lucky

02:50.203 --> 02:51.504
FRASIER: Dad, Daphne, hi,

02:51.504 --> 02:53.199
How you doing?

02:53.506 --> 02:54.507
Listen, Niles, I've got
to cancel our dinner,

02:54.507 --> 02:55.508
I have to meet Roz's replacement

02:55.508 --> 02:57.210
over at the station before the show,

02:57.210 --> 02:59.512
What's this?

02:59.512 --> 03:01.214
Are you pregnant?

03:01.214 --> 03:03.216
Not yet, but we're trying,

03:03.216 --> 03:04.217
Oh, well, congratulations,

03:04.217 --> 03:06.219
You've got all the fertility software

03:06.219 --> 03:07.520
and so forth?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.523
Of course, We're not animals,

03:10.523 --> 03:12.225
We're very excited,

03:12.225 --> 03:13.226
Yes, we were up half the night

03:13.226 --> 03:14.527
imagining life with our first child,

03:14.527 --> 03:17.223
Well, first child you know about,

03:17.530 --> 03:18.531
What does that mean?

03:18.531 --> 03:20.226
Well, it's not what you think, Daphne,

03:20.533 --> 03:21.534
I was just referring to the time

03:21.534 --> 03:23.536
when Niles sold his
sperm to a sperm bank,

03:23.536 --> 03:25.231
Surely, you told her about it,

03:28.241 --> 03:29.230
Off I go,

03:30.543 --> 03:33.239
You sold your sperm?

03:33.546 --> 03:35.537
Well, it was when I was
home from medical school,

03:36.249 --> 03:38.251
I saw an ad for sperm
donors, so I sold my sperm

03:38.251 --> 03:38.910
to the sperm bank,,,

03:39.319 --> 03:40.718
Stop using that word!

03:42.322 --> 03:45.348
Say "S, "

03:47.360 --> 03:49.662
I sold my "S" to earn some money

03:49.662 --> 03:51.926
so I could buy Dad a Christmas present,

03:52.332 --> 03:53.433
Which present?

03:53.433 --> 03:54.457
The fishing pole,

03:54.734 --> 03:57.794
You bought that with "S" money?

03:59.739 --> 04:00.728
Why didn't you tell me

04:01.441 --> 04:02.442
Well, it was such a long time ago,

04:02.442 --> 04:03.431
it completely slipped my mind,

04:03.743 --> 04:04.744
You're not really upset, are you?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.446
Well, of course I am,

04:06.446 --> 04:07.743
That was my favorite pole,

04:09.849 --> 04:10.850
I just thought this would be

04:10.850 --> 04:12.352
the first child for both of us,

04:12.352 --> 04:14.343
You could be a daddy already,

04:14.854 --> 04:17.357
There could be dozens of little
Niles Cranes running around,

04:17.357 --> 04:18.858
He could be your son,

04:18.858 --> 04:20.360
Or him,

04:20.360 --> 04:22.362
Oh, please, they look nothing like me,

04:22.362 --> 04:24.864
Besides, I only went
down there one time,

04:24.864 --> 04:26.855
It's possible they never used my sample,

04:27.367 --> 04:29.358
Can I borrow your sugar?

04:29.869 --> 04:30.358
DAPHNE: Yeah,

04:30.870 --> 04:33.862
I'd better look into this,

04:43.416 --> 04:44.717
There she is,

04:44.717 --> 04:46.419
Now, I've got to warn you, Doc,

04:46.419 --> 04:48.717
She's in an eelchair-way,

04:50.423 --> 04:54.359
Does her handicap preclude her
from understanding Pig Latin?

04:57.597 --> 04:59.360
Dr, Frasier Crane, king of the shrinks,

04:59.666 --> 05:01.367
meet Dana Willoughby,
queen of the sound board,

05:01.367 --> 05:02.368
Hello, Dana,

05:02.368 --> 05:03.369
Oh, it's my pleasure,

05:03.369 --> 05:04.671
Likewise, I'm sure

05:04.671 --> 05:05.660
Listen, if you have any questions,

05:06.372 --> 05:06.673
anything you'd like to know .

05:06.673 --> 05:08.374
please feel free to call on me,

05:08.374 --> 05:09.375
I'm here for you,

05:09.375 --> 05:10.677
You know, actually
there was one thing,,,

05:10.677 --> 05:12.372
Will you excuse me?

05:12.612 --> 05:13.680
Julia!

05:13.680 --> 05:14.681
Oh, hi, Frasier!

05:14.681 --> 05:16.382
Listen, we still on for dinner

05:16.382 --> 05:17.383
at Chez Henri tonight?

05:17.383 --> 05:18.685
Yes, of course, Do
you have reservations?

05:18.685 --> 05:19.686
Not as long as you're wearing

05:19.686 --> 05:20.675
something black and slinky,

05:21.387 --> 05:21.688
Ten seconds, Dr, Crane,

05:21.688 --> 05:23.389
Oh,,,

05:23.389 --> 05:25.391
Listen, why don't you
stop by my place tonight

05:25.391 --> 05:26.392
for a cocktail first?

05:26.392 --> 05:27.460
I'll see you at 7:00,

05:27.460 --> 05:28.518
Okay,

05:33.032 --> 05:35.535
Hello, Seattle, This
is Dr, Frasier Crane,

05:35.535 --> 05:37.025
Our topic today is,,,

05:38.538 --> 05:40.028
"New Beginnings, "

05:40.540 --> 05:42.542
I'd like you all to join me

05:42.542 --> 05:44.533
in welcoming a new member
to the KACL family,,,

05:44.844 --> 05:45.778
Hey, Kenny,

05:45.778 --> 05:46.779
Sorry I'm late

05:46.779 --> 05:47.780
Hey, Roz,,, Whoa, whoa!

05:47.780 --> 05:49.482
What are you doing here?

05:49.482 --> 05:50.483
I work here,

05:50.483 --> 05:51.472
You quit!

05:51.784 --> 05:52.485
Oh, come on, Kenny,

05:52.485 --> 05:53.786
If I quit, would I be here?

05:53.786 --> 05:54.775
Who's that

05:56.389 --> 05:58.691
I'm sorry-- I hired
her because I thought,,,

05:58.691 --> 06:00.693
Didn't you quit?

06:00.693 --> 06:01.694
Kenny, what's wron g with you?

06:01.694 --> 06:04.397
Never mind-- I'll
fix it like always,

06:04.397 --> 06:05.386
Oh, thanks, Roz,

06:05.565 --> 06:07.624
I owe you one,

06:08.134 --> 06:09.101
As many of you may know,

06:09.569 --> 06:11.037
my producer of ten years, Roz Doyle,

06:11.037 --> 06:14.040
has left us for greener pastures,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.042
Now, Roz was not only known

06:16.042 --> 06:18.544
for her producing prowess, but also for

06:18.544 --> 06:22.503
her warmth, her kindness
and her gentle spirit,

06:23.783 --> 06:28.421
Very well, then-- a
beginning of a new era,

06:28.421 --> 06:30.423
Let's go to our first caller,

06:30.423 --> 06:31.412
We have Scott on line two,

06:41.100 --> 06:42.802
WOMAN: Niles Crane,

06:42.802 --> 06:45.202
Hi, I'll get you a cup
and you can start,,,

06:45.671 --> 06:46.172
Oh, uh, no, no, no,

06:46.172 --> 06:47.673
I've already donated

06:47.673 --> 06:49.175
my essence to your establishment,

06:49.175 --> 06:51.177
Now I'd like to get it back,

06:51.177 --> 06:56.080
I'm sorry, It's against our
policy to return essences,

06:56.549 --> 06:57.447
Oh, I see,

06:57.950 --> 06:59.452
Well, could I at least check and see

06:59.452 --> 07:00.953
whether my donation was used?

07:00.953 --> 07:02.455
You know, see if my

07:02.455 --> 07:05.958
deposit has drawn any interest,

07:05.958 --> 07:07.448
Sir, I've worked here 28 years,

07:07.960 --> 07:09.962
Think you can tell me
one I haven't heard?

07:09.962 --> 07:11.953
Go ahead, Try me,

07:14.967 --> 07:16.969
No,

07:16.969 --> 07:20.173
According to our records,
your sample wasn't used,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.675
So there are no little
Niles Cranes running around,

07:22.675 --> 07:24.177
What a relief,

07:24.177 --> 07:26.168
Isn't it?

07:28.147 --> 07:30.138
Thank you for your time

07:31.651 --> 07:34.153
Just a quick question,

07:34.153 --> 07:35.655
Based on my qualifications,

07:35.655 --> 07:37.657
I'd assumed there' d be some interest,

07:37.657 --> 07:39.557
Any nibbles?

07:40.059 --> 07:42.662
According to our records,
your sample was discarded,

07:42.662 --> 07:45.654
It was rated substandard,

07:47.633 --> 07:49.168
Substandard?

07:49.168 --> 07:51.904
Your sperm had very low motility,

07:51.904 --> 07:53.997
So they're,,,

07:54.607 --> 07:56.575
Slow movers,

07:56.742 --> 07:57.810
Really?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.512
But that, that was
more than 20 years ago,

07:59.512 --> 08:01.514
s There's a chance that my situation'

08:01.514 --> 08:03.149
improved since then, isn't there?

08:03.149 --> 08:06.915
Can you run faster now
than you did 20 years ago?

08:09.589 --> 08:11.090
So, you're saying it might be difficult

08:11.090 --> 08:13.259
for my wife and me to conceive?

08:13.259 --> 08:15.557
Very difficult, yes,

08:17.864 --> 08:19.889
I'm sorry,

08:20.166 --> 08:21.929
Uh, thank you,

08:27.573 --> 08:28.574
Ah!

08:28.574 --> 08:29.876
Excuse me, sir, Terribly sorry,

08:29.876 --> 08:31.571
Carry on,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.524
(doorbell ringing)

08:44.524 --> 08:45.752
Eddie, you get stuck in there again

08:46.259 --> 08:47.749
and you're on your own

08:52.765 --> 08:53.766
Hey, Niles,

08:53.766 --> 08:54.755
Hey, Dad, Is Frasier here?

08:55.268 --> 08:55.757
Uh, primping,

08:56.269 --> 08:57.270
Oh,

08:57.270 --> 08:57.759
He's going out with Julia,

08:58.271 --> 08:59.272
Right, right,

08:59.272 --> 09:00.773
Daphne's out with her mum tonight,

09:00.773 --> 09:02.275
so I thought I'd borrow a DVD,

09:02.275 --> 09:04.266
Oh, well, you're in luck

09:04.777 --> 09:05.778
I just picked this one up,

09:05.778 --> 09:07.280
Crime Scene Bloopers 4:

09:07.280 --> 09:09.271
You Have the Right to Remain Zany,

09:12.018 --> 09:13.586
Sounds tempting, but I'm, uh,

09:13.586 --> 09:16.088
I'm looking for something
a little more soothing,

09:16.088 --> 09:18.090
I didn't have the best day,

09:18.090 --> 09:19.079
Oh, what happened?

09:19.592 --> 09:23.095
Got some bad news at the "S" bank,

09:23.095 --> 09:26.132
Apparently I suffer from low motility,

09:26.132 --> 09:27.700
Oh, I'm sorry, son,

09:27.700 --> 09:29.190
How'd Daphne take it?

09:29.735 --> 09:31.637
Uh, well, I haven't had
the heart to tell her yet,

09:31.637 --> 09:33.139
but, uh, I'm hoping I won't have to,

09:33.139 --> 09:34.640
I did some research
today and I found out

09:34.640 --> 09:37.143
there's some things I can
do to help rouse the troops,

09:37.143 --> 09:37.944
Oh, yeah?

09:37.944 --> 09:39.775
Like what?

09:40.046 --> 09:41.138
Uh, well, such as wearing baggy pants,

09:41.614 --> 09:43.616
and, uh, boxers instead of briefs,

09:43.616 --> 09:44.605
Studies show that men who allow

09:45.151 --> 09:46.619
their genitals to swing freely,,,

09:46.619 --> 09:48.348
Okay, I got it,

09:52.158 --> 09:55.661
No hot baths, no alcohol, raw seafood,

09:55.661 --> 09:58.664
and I've started a regimen
of dietary supplements,

09:58.664 --> 10:00.655
Which reminds me,

10:02.702 --> 10:04.003
What's that ?

10:04.003 --> 10:07.406
French maritime pine bark extract,

10:07.406 --> 10:11.978
It boosts fertility and
also acts as a mild euphoric,

10:11.978 --> 10:13.969
which accounts for the
well-known joviality

10:14.680 --> 10:15.977
of French sailors,

10:17.817 --> 10:19.876
Terrible aftertaste though,

10:20.386 --> 10:21.375
(grunts)

10:23.389 --> 10:26.256
I thought those were
supposed to be crunchy,

10:28.194 --> 10:29.752
Oh, Niles,

10:30.262 --> 10:31.764
Dad, Julia's on her way,

10:31.764 --> 10:33.755
You told me you'd keep to
your room while she's here ,

10:34.266 --> 10:35.768
And take your
Cheeto-stained dog with you,

10:35.768 --> 10:37.258
MARTIN: Eddie, come on, boy,

10:40.706 --> 10:42.975
too, I'll be,,, I'll be leaving,

10:42.975 --> 10:45.044
Oh, no, Niles, could you
stay for just a moment?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.746
There's something going on in my life

10:46.746 --> 10:47.735
that requires a bit of mulling,

10:48.047 --> 10:48.741
Sherry?

10:48.881 --> 10:49.949
No, thanks,

10:49.949 --> 10:50.938
No?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.653
But we never mull without sherry,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.054
Not for me,

10:55.054 --> 10:56.055
Very well,

10:56.055 --> 10:57.456
Have a seat,

10:57.456 --> 10:59.048
Uh, I'd rather stand,

11:01.727 --> 11:03.729
Suit yourself,

11:03.729 --> 11:06.032
Anyway, it's about Roz

11:06.032 --> 11:08.367
After quitting her job,

11:08.367 --> 11:12.304
twice, she shows up
back at work again today,

11:12.304 --> 11:14.795
Waist deep in a sea of denial,

11:15.307 --> 11:16.797
Well, I confronted her on the issue,,,

11:18.310 --> 11:20.813
What the hell are you doing?

11:20.813 --> 11:23.115
Sorry, Go on,

11:23.115 --> 11:24.684
Anyway, I confronted her on the issue,

11:24.684 --> 11:26.686
and she refused to discuss it with me,

11:26.686 --> 11:29.188
She wouldn't even look me in the eye,

11:29.188 --> 11:32.680
Leads me to just one conclusion, Niles,

11:34.193 --> 11:36.062
She's in love with me,

11:36.062 --> 11:39.793
Uh,,, I wouldn't necessarily
jump to that conclusion,

11:40.032 --> 11:41.795
That's because you
don't have all the facts,

11:42.068 --> 11:44.770
I never shared this
with you before, Niles,

11:44.770 --> 11:46.005
so brace yourself,

11:46.005 --> 11:49.842
Two years ago Roz and I slept together,

11:49.842 --> 11:51.343
Get out!

11:51.343 --> 11:53.834
You and Roz?!

11:54.313 --> 11:57.316
We did have a chance to
discuss it thoroughly,

11:57.316 --> 11:59.307
Talked things out,

11:59.819 --> 12:04.188
And at the time she seemed
happy to remain friends,

12:04.890 --> 12:12.098
I realize now that I must
have kindled a spark in her--

12:12.098 --> 12:15.727
that lit the torch she
carries to this day,

12:15.935 --> 12:18.370
So what do you think,,, (humming)

12:18.370 --> 12:20.770
Are your pants humming?

12:23.909 --> 12:28.114
It's,,, it's my test
icular hypothermia device,

12:28.114 --> 12:31.817
It promotes motility by
keeping my nether regions

12:31.817 --> 12:33.808
at a cool and constant 96 degrees

12:34.086 --> 12:35.747
(doorbell ringing) Oh, dear,

12:35.888 --> 12:37.446
No, no, that wasn't me,,,
Yes, I know,I know that,

12:42.461 --> 12:44.463
Oh, Julia, hi, Hello,

12:44.463 --> 12:45.965
Good to see you, What's all this ?

12:45.965 --> 12:47.466
It's dinner, I know,
We said we'd go out,

12:47.466 --> 12:50.469
but I thought it'd be
more fun to stay in,

12:50.469 --> 12:51.470
And what's in here

12:51.470 --> 12:52.471
Is this dessert?

12:52.471 --> 12:53.973
Well, you could call it that,

12:53.973 --> 12:55.964
Oh! Hello, Niles,

12:56.342 --> 12:57.409
Hello,

12:57.409 --> 13:00.412
Well, I'll just go start dinner,

13:00.412 --> 13:01.401
Fine,

13:03.415 --> 13:04.850
Well,,,

13:04.850 --> 13:07.419
Looks like someone's
getting lucky tonight,

13:07.419 --> 13:09.785
She was, but I'm beginning
to have second thoughts,

13:09.989 --> 13:11.081
Why?

13:11.557 --> 13:13.559
Niles, Julia and I have
never been together sexually,

13:13.559 --> 13:15.550
Look what happened with Roz,

13:16.061 --> 13:17.062
We slept together
two years ago--

13:17.062 --> 13:18.051
she's still suffering,

13:19.965 --> 13:22.902
In the sense of pining,

13:22.902 --> 13:25.404
Frasier, you don't really suppose

13:25.404 --> 13:26.906
that after one night, Julia,,,

13:26.906 --> 13:28.407
Open your eyes, Niles!

13:28.407 --> 13:29.909
It's the same scenario,

13:29.909 --> 13:31.911
An infatuated coworker,
a night of passion,

13:31.911 --> 13:33.913
What if things don't
work out between us?

13:33.913 --> 13:36.415
Every day she'll be forced

13:36.415 --> 13:40.352
to stare through the glass at me,,,

13:40.352 --> 13:42.822
wondering what might have been

13:42.822 --> 13:46.280
until one day, like Roz, she goes mad,

13:49.261 --> 13:52.264
Um, I'm leaving now

13:52.264 --> 13:55.267
Can I pick you up anything on Earth?

13:55.267 --> 13:57.970
Oh, Niles, don't you see?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.972
I'm just trying to be responsible,

13:59.972 --> 14:00.973
I don't want to sleep with Julia

14:00.973 --> 14:02.270
until I know that
there' s a future for us,

14:02.975 --> 14:03.976
Well, Frasier,

14:03.976 --> 14:05.273
I'm sure you'll make the right choice,

14:05.978 --> 14:07.279
but if you'll permit me an observation,

14:07.279 --> 14:09.281
you do tend to take things to extremes,

14:09.281 --> 14:11.283
(beeping) Oh, I have to plug myself

14:11.283 --> 14:13.979
into my cigarette lighter and recharge,

14:16.222 --> 14:18.213
So,,,

14:18.924 --> 14:20.915
alone at last,

14:22.161 --> 14:24.152
Yes,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.866
But, you know, there's
really no need for you

14:26.866 --> 14:28.167
to go to all this trouble,

14:28.167 --> 14:30.169
We can still have dinner at Chez Henri,

14:30.169 --> 14:32.171
No, dinner's coming along great ,

14:32.171 --> 14:33.873
In fact, um,,,

14:33.873 --> 14:35.875
I've got a little sauce right here

14:35.875 --> 14:36.864
if you want to taste it,

14:38.878 --> 14:40.880
Oh,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.177
Well,,,

14:48.087 --> 14:51.579
Mm, That's yummy, yes,

14:53.592 --> 14:55.094
I've had such a stressful day,

14:55.094 --> 14:57.096
You know what would feel great?

14:57.096 --> 14:58.586
A back rub

14:59.098 --> 15:02.101
 You know where I could find
a pair of strong, manly hands?

15:02.101 --> 15:07.106
You know, I think Zoltan from
the club makes house calls,

15:07.106 --> 15:09.108
Let me get you his number

15:09.108 --> 15:10.910
Frasier, is everything all right?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.411
Yes, of course,

15:12.411 --> 15:14.380
Because if you're not interested,,,

15:14.380 --> 15:15.915
Oh, no, no, no, I am, I am,

15:15.915 --> 15:17.906
I'm very interested ; It's just that,,,

15:20.920 --> 15:23.411
Before we take things to the next level,

15:23.923 --> 15:28.060
you should know there are certain risks,

15:28.060 --> 15:30.062
Oh, my God,

15:30.062 --> 15:32.064
You've got a sexually
- transmitted disease,

15:32.064 --> 15:33.565
No, no, no, no,

15:33.565 --> 15:35.534
Of course not, Of course not,,,

15:35.534 --> 15:38.037
Oh,,, Although, in a
manner of speaking,,,

15:38.037 --> 15:39.038
(doorbell ringing)

15:39.038 --> 15:40.027
Oh, excuse me,

15:43.042 --> 15:44.543
It's Roz,

15:44.543 --> 15:46.101
What's she doing here?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.616
Listen, uh, just give us a moment or
two together and I'll get rid of her,

15:50.616 --> 15:52.607
Fine,

15:54.620 --> 15:56.121
Hey, Fras,

15:56.121 --> 15:57.056
Hi, Roz,

15:57.056 --> 15:59.124
Can I come in?

15:59.124 --> 16:01.024
Yes,

16:01.293 --> 16:03.996
Is,,, everything okay?

16:03.996 --> 16:08.000
Look, I know how crazy
I've been acting lately,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.004
I,,, here last night and
today at the radio station,

16:12.004 --> 16:13.301
I mean, I don't even
understand it myself,

16:14.006 --> 16:15.307
But then I took this long walk

16:15.307 --> 16:17.241
and I think I finally figured it out,

16:17.977 --> 16:18.744
I just feel so stupid,

16:18.744 --> 16:20.245
No, Roz,

16:20.245 --> 16:22.236
Not stupid,

16:22.748 --> 16:24.238
Human,

16:24.750 --> 16:27.252
And all too vulnerable,

16:27.252 --> 16:30.122
You've realized that
you're in love with me,

16:30.122 --> 16:33.025
No, that's not it,

16:33.025 --> 16:34.626
Come on, I can see

16:34.626 --> 16:36.662
why you would think that
based on how I've been acting,

16:36.662 --> 16:37.663
but that's not it,

16:37.663 --> 16:40.065
Okay, okay, just to be clear,

16:40.065 --> 16:43.002
you haven't been pining over
me since we slept together?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.766
God, no, Weren't you there ?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.512
Just, uh,,, hold that thought,

16:53.512 --> 16:55.514
I've got to get in the kitchen

16:55.514 --> 16:58.517
and move something back
to the front burner,

16:58.517 --> 17:00.019
Julia,

17:00.019 --> 17:01.077
Oh, let me guess,

17:01.520 --> 17:03.222
Roz is staying for dinner,

17:03.222 --> 17:04.522
No, no, no, Just us,

17:04.522 --> 17:07.226
Listen, I'd like to apologize

17:07.226 --> 17:10.529
for,,, being skittish earlier,

17:10.529 --> 17:14.532
I,,, just chalk it up
to nerves, all right?

17:14.532 --> 17:17.236
I mean, after all, this
is a big night for us,

17:17.236 --> 17:19.538
We've never done this before,

17:19.538 --> 17:22.141
I have,

17:22.141 --> 17:25.444
Well, as have I, What I meant was,,,

17:25.444 --> 17:27.445
No, no, I know what you meant,

17:27.445 --> 17:28.446
So,,,

17:28.446 --> 17:29.448
You're forgiven,

17:29.448 --> 17:30.437
Thank you,

17:31.150 --> 17:32.451
Where were we? Oh, oh, yes,

17:32.451 --> 17:36.155
I believe we were about
to sample some sauce,

17:36.155 --> 17:38.157
Ow! Ow! That's hot! Hot!

17:38.157 --> 17:39.458
Oh, God!

17:39.458 --> 17:41.160
I'll just go get rid of Roz!

17:41.160 --> 17:43.162
You know, we've got
so much to talk about,

17:43.162 --> 17:45.164
What do you say we pick
this up again tomorrow

17:45.164 --> 17:46.165
over a cup of coffee?

17:46.165 --> 17:47.166
(laughing) : Okay,

17:47.166 --> 17:49.468
My God, you have quite the ego on you,

17:49.468 --> 17:52.171
We slept together like two years ago,

17:52.171 --> 17:56.733
What do you think, you're some kind
of slow-acting time-release love bomb?

17:59.278 --> 18:02.281
I don't remember you having any
complaints when we were in bed,

18:02.281 --> 18:04.583
I seem to recall hearing
the term "stallion-like, "

18:04.583 --> 18:05.584
I never said that,

18:05.584 --> 18:09.655
Well, one of us did,

18:09.655 --> 18:11.145
Okay, this is just too weird,

18:11.657 --> 18:12.658
Julia,,,

18:12.658 --> 18:15.160
No, this is obviously
a bad night for you,

18:15.160 --> 18:16.662
Look, Roz was just leaving,

18:16.662 --> 18:18.653
Well, I'll send the
elevator back up for her,

18:19.164 --> 18:21.133
Juli,,, Oh,

18:21.133 --> 18:24.636
Frasier, I'm so sorry about that,

18:24.636 --> 18:25.471
No, it's my fault

18:25.471 --> 18:27.166
I never should have let you in,

18:30.476 --> 18:33.178
Well, I guess I've given Julia

18:33.178 --> 18:35.481
another reason to hate me,

18:35.481 --> 18:38.183
She doesn't hate you, Roz,

18:38.183 --> 18:39.485
Oh, well, she doesn't like me,

18:39.485 --> 18:41.487
and when the girlfriend
doesn't like the friend,

18:41.487 --> 18:43.188
guess who gets the boot,

18:43.188 --> 18:44.490
That's not always true,

18:44.490 --> 18:47.192
Just went through this with my dad,

18:47.192 --> 18:48.454
I was always really close to him,

18:48.861 --> 18:50.863
even after my parents split up,

18:50.863 --> 18:53.866
and six months ago he married this woman

18:53.866 --> 18:57.825
I don't get along with,
and it's like I don't exist

18:58.237 --> 19:00.171
I'm sorry,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.474
That's what I finally realized tonight,

19:02.474 --> 19:05.477
I guess I saw Julia
getting her hooks into you

19:05.477 --> 19:06.478
and I,,, I freaked,

19:06.478 --> 19:08.469
Roz,,,

19:08.947 --> 19:11.383
the day a woman tells me that
I can't be friends with you

19:11.383 --> 19:13.715
is the day I know I
picked the wrong woman,

19:14.219 --> 19:15.709
Thanks, Frasier,

19:18.357 --> 19:21.660
Say, Julia has a dangerously
hot meal cooking in the kitchen,

19:21.660 --> 19:23.362
Why don't you stay?

19:23.362 --> 19:24.663
Oh, that sounds great,

19:24.663 --> 19:25.652
But wait, She went to all this trouble

19:26.365 --> 19:27.666
to make this dinner for you,

19:27.666 --> 19:30.369
If she finds out I'm the one
who ate it, it'll kill her,

19:30.369 --> 19:31.370
You can't tell her, Roz,

19:31.370 --> 19:33.361
Come on, please,

19:35.908 --> 19:39.878
(soft music plays)

19:39.878 --> 19:41.869
Hello?

19:42.881 --> 19:43.870
Hello,

19:46.251 --> 19:47.252
Daphne!

19:47.252 --> 19:49.388
What are you doing here?

19:49.388 --> 19:51.590
I thought you had plans tonight,

19:51.590 --> 19:53.524
Who says I don't?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.229
Champagne?

19:57.229 --> 19:58.530
Oh, sounds wonderful,

19:58.530 --> 20:02.234
Uh, on second thought, not tonight,

20:02.234 --> 20:05.537
I just thought you might like
something to wash down these oysters,

20:05.537 --> 20:08.240
Oh,,,

20:08.240 --> 20:10.242
Actually, I'm avoiding raw seafood,

20:10.242 --> 20:12.972
Would it be too much trouble
to put them in a bisque?

20:13.478 --> 20:14.467
Now?

20:14.980 --> 20:17.482
I'm sorry, I'm just,,,

20:17.482 --> 20:19.985
a little surprised by all this,

20:19.985 --> 20:22.487
I thought I'd follow
your father's advice,

20:22.487 --> 20:25.490
A little less science,
a little more romance,

20:25.490 --> 20:28.891
(whirring and beeping)

20:30.929 --> 20:33.921
And apparently it's working,

20:36.435 --> 20:40.772
That would be my TestiCool 2000,

20:40.772 --> 20:42.672
Your what?

20:44.676 --> 20:46.667
I should have told you this earlier,

20:47.379 --> 20:49.381
I had some disappointing news today,

20:49.381 --> 20:51.683
It seems that I suffer from low motility

20:51.683 --> 20:55.387
and it might not be
possible for us to conceive,

20:55.387 --> 20:56.376
Oh,

20:56.688 --> 20:57.689
I'm so sorry,

20:57.689 --> 20:59.391
Don't be sorry

20:59.391 --> 21:01.393
We'll be all right

21:01.393 --> 21:03.395
There's so many things
they can do these days

21:03.395 --> 21:04.384
to help infertile couples,

21:04.696 --> 21:05.697
True,

21:05.697 --> 21:07.699
And until we find out more,

21:07.699 --> 21:11.370
I don't see why we don't
give Mother Nature a shot,

21:11.370 --> 21:12.667
I took the test today,

21:13.372 --> 21:15.670
I'm ovulating,

21:16.375 --> 21:17.609
Mmm,,,

21:17.609 --> 21:18.610
(chuckling)

21:18.610 --> 21:20.612
Well, in that case,,,

21:20.612 --> 21:23.315
Iast one upstairs is a rot,,,

21:23.315 --> 21:25.617
Oh, Daph, this isn't the ovulation kit,

21:25.617 --> 21:27.619
It's the pregnancy test,

21:27.619 --> 21:28.620
Oh, silly me,

21:28.620 --> 21:29.609
They look so much,,,

21:33.458 --> 21:35.949
We're pregnant

21:36.461 --> 21:37.951
Oh, my God, we are, aren't we?

21:38.463 --> 21:40.363
But my slow sperm,,,

21:42.668 --> 21:46.071
I must have fast eggs,

21:46.071 --> 21:48.407
Daphne, I love you,

21:48.407 --> 21:50.909
I love you, too,

21:50.909 --> 21:54.413
Oh, ow, oh, ow, that hurts,

21:54.413 --> 21:56.415
Something seems to be short-circuiting,

21:56.415 --> 21:59.418
Ow! Ow!

21:59.418 --> 22:00.407
Ow!

22:05.457 --> 22:07.448
That's your daddy,

22:08.305 --> 22:14.516
