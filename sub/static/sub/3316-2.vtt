Screw you, Judas bitch.

42:09.451 --> 42:11.783
Stand up, Grace. Stand up.

42:13.956 --> 42:17.915

42:17.993 --> 42:21.156
She's not the one who deserves
to be punished. I am.

42:21.230 --> 42:23.630

a desperate friend.

42:25.067 --> 42:27.501

42:42.351 --> 42:46.082
So that makes 40 for you, Sir Galahad.

43:00.669 --> 43:02.762
