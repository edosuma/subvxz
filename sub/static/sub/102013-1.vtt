WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.175
Previously on Nancy Drew...

00:06.006 --> 00:08.175
You had every

00:08.175 --> 00:10.302
opportunity to tell me the truth

00:10.302 --> 00:12.888
that Ryan Hudson
is my biological father?

00:12.888 --> 00:14.473
Oh, my God.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.473
All we knew

00:14.473 --> 00:16.808
was what Lucy told us.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.101
Hey. You left this in my car.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.436
Is this you?

00:19.436 --> 00:21.396
This is a picture
of Lucy as a baby.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.023
Why do you look
like twins?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.275
NANCY:
Lucy wanted me to find out

00:25.275 --> 00:28.070
that she had her baby
before she died,

00:28.070 --> 00:29.321
and that the baby survived.

00:29.321 --> 00:30.739
I survived.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.032
CARSON:
I'll sleep

00:32.032 --> 00:33.367
in my office loft.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.868
I'll give you that
space you want.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.620
NANCY:
My friends and I did this ritual

00:36.620 --> 00:40.290
to call to this sea spirit.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.209
And it worked. The-the Aglaeca
answered my call,

00:42.209 --> 00:44.086
but the problem is,

00:44.086 --> 00:45.837
I couldn't hold up my end
of the bargain.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.798
And now we've triggered this,
uh, curse.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.132
(screaming)

00:49.132 --> 00:50.592
(roars)

00:50.592 --> 00:52.803
(panting)

00:52.803 --> 00:54.805
(screams)

00:54.805 --> 00:56.556
(body thuds)

00:56.556 --> 00:57.724
(gasps)

01:00.477 --> 01:03.689
NANCY: I used to go looking
in the dark to find the truth.

01:03.689 --> 01:07.526
I was Nancy Drew,
girl detective of Horseshoe Bay,

01:07.526 --> 01:10.028
solver of everyone else's
mysteries.

01:10.028 --> 01:13.532
Then I learned that I was
the biggest mystery all along.

01:13.532 --> 01:16.243
Everything I thought I knew
about my life had been a lie.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.578
I have no idea who I am anymore.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.373
And now I may never get
the chance to figure it out.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.457
(roaring)

01:24.376 --> 01:26.920
(screams)

01:26.920 --> 01:28.964
Because a vengeful sea spirit
called the Aglaeca

01:28.964 --> 01:31.758
is about to kill me
and my friends.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.510
(entry bell jingles)

01:33.510 --> 01:35.137
I burned alive
at the Marvin Estate.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.390
Hanged from a meat hook
right here.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.601
Drowned in my truck.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.398
I drowned, too.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.942
NANCY:
I fell from
the bluffs.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.320
Just like my mother.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.448
BESS:
Maybe these

01:54.448 --> 01:56.450
are visions of what
could potentially happen,

01:56.450 --> 01:59.202
you know,
not actually our future.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.496
Like, a-a proposed death.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.832
Like a serving suggestion
on a waffle box.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.459
You can't actually...

02:03.832 --> 02:05.459
Or maybe our time is running out

02:05.459 --> 02:06.877
and we're all gonna die.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.712
Nobody is dying.

02:08.712 --> 02:11.340
And spiraling out of fear
is not useful right now.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.966
We may know how the Aglaeca
wants to kill us,

02:12.966 --> 02:14.051
but we don't know when.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.553
We need a plan.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.055
BESS:
Oh, I know.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.349
We destroy the implements
of each other's demise.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.683
Like, I can get rid
of Nick's truck.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.185
Hey, I kind of
love that truck.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.562
We're gonna drown inside it.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.980
Oh, okay, okay.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.607
Bess, lose-lose my truck.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.817
Um, I'll get rid of the
meat hooks in the cooler

02:30.817 --> 02:33.612
and anything else
that looks impale-y.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.948
I'll try to render Bess
nonflammable.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.075
(entry bell jingles)

02:40.744 --> 02:42.162
Detective Tamura.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.164
Nancy Drew?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.916
Up for debate, but sure.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.334
Gonna need you to come with me.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.711
Why?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.711
20 minutes ago,

02:49.711 --> 02:51.463
we got an incident report
from the edge of Gorham Woods.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.343
Some girl came running
out of the forest,

02:56.343 --> 02:57.803
got sideswiped by park rangers.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.429
(gasping)

03:00.722 --> 03:02.349
She'd been attacked

03:02.349 --> 03:03.350
prior to that.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.185
No I.D., no phone.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.271
Before she lost consciousness,
she said your name.

03:09.564 --> 03:13.068
Nancy Drew.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.571
NANCY:
Just when I thought I had
enough problems for one night.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.365
♪ ♪

03:30.335 --> 03:31.962
NANCY: Totally happy to help you
identify your Jane Doe,

03:31.962 --> 03:34.172
but I have something
very urgent to get back to.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.091
More urgent than being a suspect
in a comatose girl's assault?

03:36.091 --> 03:37.342
You have four eyewitnesses

03:37.342 --> 03:39.136
to verify my whereabouts
this evening.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.887
I hoped you'd have something
to contribute besides attitude.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.222
Wait there.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.476
Parental warning. Six o'clock.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.858
I cannot deal with
Carson right now.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.317
I'll cover you.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.610
TAMURA:
Drew.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.154
Go.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.080
(mouths)

04:07.080 --> 04:08.582
Hey, Mr. Drew.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.375
George. Hey.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.377
Is everything okay?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.377
Yeah.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.920
No. I mean, i-it's nothing.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.839
I just thought I had
appendicitis, but it turns out

04:15.839 --> 04:17.632
it was just bad fried clams
from The Claw.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.968
Oof. Yeah, I've had that exact
same experience.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.887
A couple of times.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.847
You might want to look
into changing vendors.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.183
Good tip. Smart. Thanks.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.226
Yep.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.395
I got a new client in the ER.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.022
Congrats. Are you--
you're representing doctors now?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.106
Uh, not exactly.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.818
Okay, well, really cool.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.903
That's awesome,
Mr. D. I got to go.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.404
Bye.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.824
Hey, George.
How's Nancy doing?

04:42.824 --> 04:45.410
I moved out yesterday,
so I haven't seen her.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.497
Um, she's totally fine.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.457
Yeah, no. She-She's
staying out of trouble.

04:50.457 --> 04:54.628
Bye.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.963
NANCY:
I've never seen her before.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.841
Yet she clearly knew you.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.259
I'm known for solving cases
around town.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.345
Maybe she needed my help
with something.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.972
Right.
The Hero of Horseshoe Bay.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.390
Great fansite, by the way.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.809
Well, thank you.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.770
Did you notice the, uh,
numbers on her hand?

05:14.814 --> 05:18.735
No. I'm an incredibly
unobservant detective.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.278
They mean anything to you?

05:20.278 --> 05:22.364
No.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.364
All right.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.324
We're done here.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.829
You know, it is weird, though,
that she was seen

05:29.829 --> 05:32.624
running out of Gorham Woods
on a full moon.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.209
I mean, you know
what they say.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.795
What do they say?

05:36.795 --> 05:39.839
Just that the woods are haunted
by the Gorham Wraith.

05:39.839 --> 05:43.009
It's a phantom that rises
with the full moon,

05:43.009 --> 05:45.679
and feeds on the fear
of those lost in the woods.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.681
It draws you
deeper and deeper in

05:47.681 --> 05:49.599
until you can't find
your way out.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.476
It's the last anybody
ever hears from you.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.394
Cute.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.356
You can go now.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.442
I just...

05:59.442 --> 06:01.486
I hope
she wakes up soon...

06:03.488 --> 06:05.699
...gives you the answers
you're looking for.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.077
Well, let's hope her answers
corroborate yours.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.056
Hey. Carson's gone.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.058
How's Jane Doe?

06:32.058 --> 06:36.354
She is still unconscious, but
she's got a great handshake.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.066
That is "Aglaeca" hidden in
the code written on her hand.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.652
How do you have the bandwidth
for another mystery right now?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.654
Because I think that
Jane Doe's mystery

06:44.654 --> 06:46.531
has something to do with ours.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.870
ACE: Thanks for making sure
I don't die in there

06:51.870 --> 06:53.455
with my bloodied,
writhing body hanging

06:53.455 --> 06:54.873
in what was once my happy place.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.499
Hey, Nancy was right.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.086
Spiraling about fear
won't get us anywhere.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.796
She was just saying that
for morale.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.298
I don't think
she believes it herself.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.299
It's not like you to have doubts

07:04.299 --> 07:05.884
about Nancy.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.677
You were ready
to drink poison for her.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.055
I knew that was water.
This is not water.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.265
This is a death curse
which we only caught

07:12.265 --> 07:14.267
because we helped Nancy
call to the Aglaeca.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.518
Well, if you
blame Nancy,

07:15.518 --> 07:17.604
why are you hacking for her
right now?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.439
Enlightened
self-preservation.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.441
Code might be Aglaeca-related.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.153
Whoa, where is that coming from?

07:32.994 --> 07:36.164
I believe that's Aglaeca
for "don't mess with me."

07:36.164 --> 07:37.832
(door opens)

07:37.832 --> 07:39.042
Did you find anything
from the code?

07:40.043 --> 07:41.544
Uh, yeah.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.423
Led to an anonymizing browser
and an encrypted outbox,

07:45.423 --> 07:47.175
which...

07:47.175 --> 07:48.802
I just cracked.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.971
And it contained a single

07:51.971 --> 07:54.432
outgoing message

07:54.432 --> 07:57.227
directed to you, Nancy.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.104
NANCY:
"Nancy Drew,
I have a mirror

07:59.104 --> 08:01.106
"that can be used
against the Aglaeca.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.651
"Be at the old hatchery barn
outside Gorham Woods

08:04.651 --> 08:06.486
at 1:00 a.m.
Bring the cash."

08:06.486 --> 08:07.821
What cash?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.447
Wait, someone
wants to sell us

08:09.447 --> 08:11.408
an Aglaeca-fighting
mirror?

08:11.408 --> 08:13.535
Someone and her partner.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.578
Look, that's a man's hand
in the photo.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.163
NICK:
Hey, 1:00 a.m.
was 30 minutes ago.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.498
He could still be there.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.958
Maybe he waited.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.958
GEORGE:
Hold up.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.584
Before we go galloping
off into the Gorham Woods

08:21.584 --> 08:23.128
on a full moon,
how do we know

08:23.128 --> 08:24.921
that this mirror can help
us fight the Aglaeca?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.881
Yeah, and how did Jane Doe
and her MIA partner

08:26.881 --> 08:28.383
know we even needed help?

08:28.383 --> 08:30.677
I give you a tweet

08:30.677 --> 08:32.887
from @NancyDrewNews.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.349
"Nancy needs your help.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.978
"Cash reward for any leads
related to the fearsome Aglaeca.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.354
#MatterOfLifeOrDeath."

08:41.354 --> 08:42.856
I did not post that.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.023
I sure as hell
didn't.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.567
And I'm not
on social media.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.776
Guess who is.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.989
Okay, yeah, I sent out an SOS.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.450
You Twitter-sourced
our death premonitions,

08:53.450 --> 08:55.285
and you offered a reward.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.412
Okay, you know when you
have a vision

08:57.412 --> 08:58.663
of yourself as a crème brûlée,

08:58.663 --> 09:00.331
it's-it's a good time
to try things.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.459
Oh, and, um, Nick.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.754
D-Do you mind lending me
the-the 750 bucks?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.213
GEORGE:
$750 for what?

09:07.213 --> 09:08.840
We still have no idea

09:08.840 --> 09:11.050
if this mirror has anything
to do with the Aglaeca.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.305
We do.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.514
And it does.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.099
I recognize the snake carvings.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.934
I-It belonged to
the Women in White--

09:19.934 --> 09:22.103
the first people
who called to the Aglaeca.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.272
See? Progress.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.732
ACE:
Don't forget,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.275
this still leaves us in
the middle of some haunted woods

09:27.275 --> 09:28.693
on a full moon.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.153
There's nothing to say
that the wraith

09:30.153 --> 09:31.780
isn't urban legend.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.365
Except centuries of
lore and superstition,

09:34.365 --> 09:37.327
and the occasional person
who was never seen again.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.578
And the fact that every
urban legend we encounter

09:38.578 --> 09:40.955
in Horseshoe Bay
turns out to be real.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.332
Okay. Oh, dear.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.666
Devil's advocate.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.293
So far, we've been
playing defense

09:45.293 --> 09:47.170
against a bunch of
hallucinations.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.922
At least we know
this mirror exists.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.134
A lead worth following.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.553
Only one we got.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.138
Who's in?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.648
(crickets chirping)

10:07.941 --> 10:09.526
NANCY:
Looks like no one's here.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.827
I found a lighter.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.704
(loud clattering)

10:21.704 --> 10:23.581
Whoa.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.791
(whispers):
Sorry.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.840
Hey, Nick. Shine
a light over here.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.804
Oh. I got a phone.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.391
Hey. And some...

10:41.391 --> 10:44.811
kind of medication or drug.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.563
It's still sealed.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.152
I'll get it unlocked.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.821
It's some kind of messaging app.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.740
Gil, where are you?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.740
NANCY:
That's our Jane Doe.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.993
Keep your pants on, Amanda.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.995
Leaving the lodge now,
all right? I got it.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.629
(chuckles):
Who's that handsome devil?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.256
Send the picture I just took,

11:13.256 --> 11:14.799
the message, encrypt it all.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.302
Hey, code's on your hand.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.636
Don't screw this up.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.722
Don't patronize me.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.644
GIL:
Fine.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.105
But only because
you're two minutes older.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.315
Twins.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.025
BESS:
Okay, so why
did they use

11:32.025 --> 11:33.526
the video messages?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.445
It's a dark web app.
They expire

11:35.445 --> 11:37.864
in a matter of hours and
the police can't trace them.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.699
Um, by the way,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.785
you have an hour
to refill your pump.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.370
You're welcome.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.122
(shrieking)

11:44.370 --> 11:46.122
Wha...? Gil?

11:46.122 --> 11:49.208
Gil? Is that you?

11:49.208 --> 11:52.712
(lighter flicking)

11:49.208 --> 11:52.712
Why isn't this working?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.213
(breath trembling)

11:54.213 --> 11:56.382
Oh, come on, c-come on.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.718
Gil?

11:59.928 --> 12:00.970
Gil?

12:05.308 --> 12:06.684
(shrieking)

12:05.308 --> 12:06.684
(screaming)

12:07.685 --> 12:09.687
(screaming continues)

12:09.687 --> 12:11.814
Get off-- get off me!

12:13.316 --> 12:16.277
Was that the wraith?
So it is real.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.613
No, no, we can't make
anything out from the video.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.823
Whatever it was,
Amanda ran from it,

12:20.823 --> 12:23.117
and she got past the boundary
of the woods.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.453
That's how she escaped, and she
found herself outside this barn.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.413
Right. Well,

12:27.413 --> 12:29.874
we're about a half a mile
from where Amanda was found.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.168
So she must have
kept running west

12:32.168 --> 12:34.671
and then fallen down this slope.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.589
That's where she got
her injuries.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.589
ACE: Amanda said Gil

12:36.589 --> 12:38.383
had to refill his
pump in the video.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.884
A pump could mean
he's diabetic.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.219
I'm willing to bet
that vial

12:41.219 --> 12:43.471
is insulin.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.471
But he

12:41.219 --> 12:43.471
never made it back.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.723
Say something happened to Gil
when he was leaving the lodge.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.101
How far could he be from here
if Amanda expected him back

12:48.101 --> 12:50.186
in an hour?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.186
ACE: There's

12:48.101 --> 12:50.186
an old hunting lodge

12:50.186 --> 12:52.188
on the north edge
of the Gorham Woods.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.774
I used to hike a lot when
I was an Eagle Scout.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.068
Nobody ever seemed
to use the place.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.068
GEORGE: Mm-hmm.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.945
Right here.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.446
Pinecrest Lodge.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.446
BESS:
Yep.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.907
Built in 1850.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.369
Owned by the Hudson
Family Trust.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.958
(quietly):
Of course.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.960
(sighs):
Come on.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.341
(gate creaks)

13:21.592 --> 13:23.386
So, Gil's bootprints
have triangles.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.223
The ground's pretty soft

13:27.223 --> 13:29.017
from yesterday's rain.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.144
I'll take a look around,
see if he left any tracks.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.646
Yeah. I-I'll keep an eye out
for bears.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.732
The rest of us
can head into the lodge

13:35.732 --> 13:38.026
to see if Gil's
still in there.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.204
(lock clicking)

14:00.882 --> 14:03.384
(whispers):
All right, shh, shh.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.136
I can hear a voice.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.515
(whispers):
You're imagining things.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.100
(sighs)

14:16.856 --> 14:19.484
(quiet chatter)

14:19.484 --> 14:21.944
Oh...

14:21.944 --> 14:23.529
Or not.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.365
Mr. Hudson.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.825
I can explain.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.285
By all means.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.710
I'd love to hear it.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.643
Mr. Hudson
will be with you soon.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.811
Please, no.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.938
(panting)

14:56.938 --> 14:58.314
Oh, my God.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.108
Is that a meat hook?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.078
You know, if your grandfather
was gonna kill someone,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.747
this is definitely the
room he would do it in.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.290
Okay, remember, Everett
does not know we are related,

15:16.290 --> 15:17.500
and I'd like
to keep it that way.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.335
But aren't you just
a little bit curious

15:19.335 --> 15:20.711
about all of
this, Nancy?

15:20.711 --> 15:22.088
The-the society,

15:22.088 --> 15:23.881
the-the money...

15:22.088 --> 15:23.881
And the murders

15:23.881 --> 15:26.217
and the... the bullying my
mother into suicidal depression

15:26.217 --> 15:27.885
and the threats
to kill me as a baby?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.595
Yeah, all that happened
before I was even born.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.514
God knows what
he would do to me now.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.099
Yeah, but he is

15:31.514 --> 15:33.099
your blood.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.099
And I am...

15:33.099 --> 15:35.268
nothing like him or the Hudsons.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.270
God, that really doesn't
answer my original concern

15:37.270 --> 15:39.063
about us getting killed

15:39.063 --> 15:41.065
in a room
with very spiky walls.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.192
So, I think that this is where
they bleed out the venison.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.902
And where they keep

15:44.902 --> 15:46.404
their Aglaeca-related
heirlooms.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.447
Gil must have snagged
that mirror off the wall

15:48.447 --> 15:49.907
before Everett got here tonight.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.534
Who would've thought that
Mr. Hudson would be hanging out

15:51.534 --> 15:53.494
here, having some weird
insomniac rich-people gathering?

15:53.494 --> 15:56.289
No, and he clearly
didn't want us to crash.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.291
Otherwise, why would
he put us in here?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.044
EVERETT:
A man has a right

16:02.044 --> 16:04.505
to defend himself
from intruders.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.636
Okay, can I just be straight up?
Is this your killing room?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.388
Who do you think I am?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.765
ACE:
Someone who
kills people.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.434
12 innocent men on a ship.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.978
Also, you put a hit out
on Carson Drew when
he was in prison.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.439
Why so quiet tonight?

16:21.439 --> 16:22.857
I don't know,
it's just I'm thinking

16:22.857 --> 16:24.817
about what you were doing
with your secret council.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.736
My guess is, plotting
to get yourself acquitted

16:26.736 --> 16:28.279
of 12 murders.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.656
Or strategizing my defense
for my upcoming trial.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.159
When you say it out loud,

16:33.159 --> 16:35.578
it sounds downright criminal.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.578
ACE:

16:33.159 --> 16:35.578
Says the man

16:35.578 --> 16:37.371
who put us in a room
full of knives

16:37.371 --> 16:38.456
and a drain on the floor.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.210
Why are you on my property?

16:49.467 --> 16:50.635
Well, Miss Drew?

16:50.635 --> 16:52.178
(door opens)

16:52.178 --> 16:53.387
RYAN:
I invited her.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.024
Well, Nancy isn't
answering my texts...

17:05.024 --> 17:06.692
(sighs):
as usual.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.908
And you know she's gonna figure
out we're together, right?

17:13.908 --> 17:16.661
(sighs):
Uh... maybe we tell her.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.747
Or maybe we let ourselves drown
horrifically in your truck

17:19.747 --> 17:22.541
and get out of a really
awkward conversation.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.169
Look at you,
always finding the bright side.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.379
Yeah.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.595
Hey, this is the last place
Gil was standing before he left

17:34.595 --> 17:36.555
to meet his sister
at the hatchery barn.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.561
And those are
his bootprints.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.567
GEORGE:
Maybe he cut
through the Gorham Woods.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.611
No local would be caught dead
there during a full moon.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.363
Perfect getaway plan.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.365
Yeah, but he didn't
make their meet,

17:54.365 --> 17:55.825
so he's probably
still in that forest.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.951
With the wraith

17:56.951 --> 17:57.910
that could kill us.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.745
One problem at a time.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.666
Come on.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.881
NICK:
Looks like Gil started walking

18:10.881 --> 18:13.092
three yards this way...

18:13.092 --> 18:16.345
He was heading south
towards the hatchery barn.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.930
And he changed direction.

18:20.433 --> 18:24.186
Looks like he...
he started running.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.063
Like he was being chased.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.415
I'm good.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.542
I didn't realize
that Nancy

18:46.542 --> 18:49.170
was gonna come through
the back door,

18:49.170 --> 18:51.797
but I invited her here
because I wanted to thank her.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.215
For?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.925
For finding out
the truth

18:54.925 --> 18:57.303
about Lucy Sable.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.139
Yeah, she told me things
that I needed to know.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.559
Made me realize
how lucky I was

19:03.559 --> 19:05.394
to have her help.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.231
So I figured that
that deserved

19:09.231 --> 19:12.068
a face-to-face
conversation

19:12.068 --> 19:14.904
and a little something
for her troubles.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.660
So you decided

19:21.660 --> 19:24.580
to tip her
in the middle of the night?

19:24.580 --> 19:25.915
Well, yeah.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.209
Soon as she got done working
at that lobster shack.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.669
I mean, come on, she
doesn't set her own hours.

19:30.669 --> 19:34.256
And she felt the need
to bring an entourage with her?

19:34.256 --> 19:36.967
Well, she enjoys
traveling with wingmen.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.220
She's a lot like you
in that way.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.806
You're welcome, Ryan.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.474
I didn't mean to intrude.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.602
I think you and
your father have

19:46.602 --> 19:47.853
some important things
to get back to.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.024
Show your guests out.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.617
You have a lovely home.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.080
When you get back...

20:06.080 --> 20:08.916
you will apologize to my friends
for the interruption.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.085
Those guys?

20:11.085 --> 20:14.004
(scoffs) Come on,
they're not your friends.

20:14.004 --> 20:17.174
No, they're just the
latest group of suits
that you're gonna...

20:17.174 --> 20:19.677
drag into
a risky business venture.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.470
They'll go down
for your actions.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.764
You'll walk away
scot-free.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.100
That's how it
always happens.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.687
But maybe I tell them
to walk away instead.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.272
Hmm.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.441
They can't.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.443
Their fortunes
are tied to mine.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.446
Just as mine
are tied to yours.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.448
If I go down,

20:40.448 --> 20:42.283
I bring you with me.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.454
Hey. Nick just texted.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.955
They found footprints.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.248
Come on.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.334
I'll catch up.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.502
Okay.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.503
Thanks.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.089
Your story was inspired.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.257
You didn't have
to cover for me.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.092

Thanks for not pressing charges
about the stolen mirror.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.531

it was a gift.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.533

family's appreciation

35:18.533 --> 35:20.118
for all your hard work.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.412

35:24.539 --> 35:27.625

Well, what I didn't tell them

35:27.625 --> 35:29.878
was you can't steal
a family heirloom

35:29.878 --> 35:32.672
when it belongs to
your actual family.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.177

from the ground up

36:07.040 --> 36:08.625
because I fired you, huh?

36:08.625 --> 36:11.628
Because I was wrongfully
accused of murder.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.005
Not great for business.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.841
What's going on with Nancy?

36:16.841 --> 36:19.302
I saw you with her.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.302
Yeah, that's-that's between

36:19.302 --> 36:21.513
her and I.
It's a family matter.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.641
If she's in trouble,
that's something that...

36:21.513 --> 36:24.641
If she's in trouble, it doesn't

36:24.641 --> 36:27.060
concern you, Carson.
She made that perfectly clear.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.478
A-And listen, before you go

36:28.478 --> 36:31.314
and you get in my face about it,
please, just remember

36:31.314 --> 36:34.526
I can tell this entire town
exactly who Nancy is.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.986

for kidnapping, now, that...

36:36.986 --> 36:39.322

for business either.

36:42.242 --> 36:43.993

junkyard's flooded.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.892

giving it away.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.604
In fact, in fact, Fred,
for you, I will give it away.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.856

Water damage like that?

37:54.856 --> 37:56.774
God knows what it's
done to the engine.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.860
Sorry, pal.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.070
No one's taking that thing off
your hands. You're out of luck.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.072
Yeah.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.200
Thanks.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.496

38:09.496 --> 38:13.333
If I were to roll this truck
off a cliff,

38:13.333 --> 38:14.751
what do you want to bet...

38:14.751 --> 38:16.503
It would land on a
flock of seagulls

38:16.503 --> 38:18.338
that would fly its ass
right back up here?

38:18.338 --> 38:20.381
I'd bet it all, baby.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.677
The Aglaeca wants us
to die in this truck.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.107
Hey.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.782
I know that you blame me

38:45.782 --> 38:48.326
for getting us
into this situation.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.038
And I really want
to make it right,

38:52.038 --> 38:55.959

38:58.211 --> 38:59.921
