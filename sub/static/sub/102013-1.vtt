WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.175
Previously on Nancy Drew...

00:06.006 --> 00:08.175
You had every

00:08.175 --> 00:10.302
opportunity to tell me the truth

00:10.302 --> 00:12.888
that Ryan Hudson
is my biological father?

00:12.888 --> 00:14.473
Oh, my God.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.473
All we knew

00:14.473 --> 00:16.808
was what Lucy told us.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.101
Hey. You left this in my car.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.436
Is this you?

00:19.436 --> 00:21.396
This is a picture
of Lucy as a baby.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.023
Why do you look
like twins?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.275
NANCY:
Lucy wanted me to find out

00:25.275 --> 00:28.070
that she had her baby
before she died,

00:28.070 --> 00:29.321
and that the baby survived.

00:29.321 --> 00:30.739
I survived.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.032
CARSON:
I'll sleep

00:32.032 --> 00:33.367
in my office loft.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.868
I'll give you that
space you want.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.620
NANCY:
My friends and I did this ritual

00:36.620 --> 00:40.290
to call to this sea spirit.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.209
And it worked. The-the Aglaeca
answered my call,

00:42.209 --> 00:44.086
but the problem is,

00:44.086 --> 00:45.837
I couldn't hold up my end
of the bargain.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.798
And now we've triggered this,
uh, curse.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.132
(screaming)

00:49.132 --> 00:50.592
(roars)

00:50.592 --> 00:52.803
(panting)

00:52.803 --> 00:54.805
(screams)

00:54.805 --> 00:56.556
(body thuds)

00:56.556 --> 00:57.724
(gasps)

01:00.477 --> 01:03.689
NANCY: I used to go looking
in the dark to find the truth.

01:03.689 --> 01:07.526
I was Nancy Drew,
girl detective of Horseshoe Bay,

01:07.526 --> 01:10.028
solver of everyone else's
mysteries.

01:10.028 --> 01:13.532
Then I learned that I was
the biggest mystery all along.

01:13.532 --> 01:16.243
Everything I thought I knew
about my life had been a lie.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.578
I have no idea who I am anymore.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.373
And now I may never get
the chance to figure it out.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.457
(roaring)

01:24.376 --> 01:26.920
(screams)

01:26.920 --> 01:28.964
Because a vengeful sea spirit
called the Aglaeca

01:28.964 --> 01:31.758
is about to kill me
and my friends.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.510
(entry bell jingles)

01:33.510 --> 01:35.137
I burned alive
at the Marvin Estate.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.390
Hanged from a meat hook
right here.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.601
Drowned in my truck.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.398
I drowned, too.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.942
NANCY:
I fell from
the bluffs.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.320
Just like my mother.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.448
BESS:
Maybe these

01:54.448 --> 01:56.450
are visions of what
could potentially happen,

01:56.450 --> 01:59.202
you know,
not actually our future.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.496
Like, a-a proposed death.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.832
Like a serving suggestion
on a waffle box.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.459
You can't actually...

02:03.832 --> 02:05.459
Or maybe our time is running out

02:05.459 --> 02:06.877
and we're all gonna die.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.712
Nobody is dying.

02:08.712 --> 02:11.340
And spiraling out of fear
is not useful right now.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.966
We may know how the Aglaeca
wants to kill us,

02:12.966 --> 02:14.051
but we don't know when.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.553
We need a plan.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.055
BESS:
Oh, I know.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.349
We destroy the implements
of each other's demise.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.683
Like, I can get rid
of Nick's truck.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.185
Hey, I kind of
love that truck.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.562
We're gonna drown inside it.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.980
Oh, okay, okay.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.607
Bess, lose-lose my truck.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.817
Um, I'll get rid of the
meat hooks in the cooler

02:30.817 --> 02:33.612
and anything else
that looks impale-y.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.948
I'll try to render Bess
nonflammable.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.075
(entry bell jingles)

02:40.744 --> 02:42.162
Detective Tamura.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.164
Nancy Drew?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.916
Up for debate, but sure.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.334
Gonna need you to come with me.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.711
Why?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.711
20 minutes ago,

02:49.711 --> 02:51.463
we got an incident report
from the edge of Gorham Woods.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.343
Some girl came running
out of the forest,

02:56.343 --> 02:57.803
got sideswiped by park rangers.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.429
(gasping)

03:00.722 --> 03:02.349
She'd been attacked

03:02.349 --> 03:03.350
prior to that.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.185
No I.D., no phone.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.271
Before she lost consciousness,
she said your name.

03:09.564 --> 03:13.068
Nancy Drew.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.571
NANCY:
Just when I thought I had
enough problems for one night.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.365
â™ª â™ª

03:30.335 --> 03:31.962
NANCY: Totally happy to help you
identify your Jane Doe,

03:31.962 --> 03:34.172
but I have something
very urgent to get back to.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.091
More urgent than being a suspect
in a comatose girl's assault?

03:36.091 --> 03:37.342
You have four eyewitnesses

03:37.342 --> 03:39.136
to verify my whereabouts
this evening.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.887
I hoped you'd have something
to contribute besides attitude.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.222
Wait there.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.476
Parental warning. Six o'clock.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.858
I cannot deal with
Carson right now.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.317
I'll cover you.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.610
TAMURA:
Drew.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.154
Go.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.080
(mouths)

04:07.080 --> 04:08.582
Hey, Mr. Drew.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.375
George. Hey.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.377
Is everything okay?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.377
Yeah.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.920
No. I mean, i-it's nothing.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.839
I just thought I had
appendicitis, but it turns out

04:15.839 --> 04:17.632
it was just bad fried clams
from The Claw.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.968
Oof. Yeah, I've had that exact
same experience.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.887
A couple of times.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.847
You might want to look
into changing vendors.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.183
Good tip. Smart. Thanks.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.226
Yep.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.395
I got a new client in the ER.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.022
Congrats. Are you--
you're representing doctors now?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.106
Uh, not exactly.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.818
Okay, well, really cool.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.903
That's awesome,
Mr. D. I got to go.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.404
Bye.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.824
Hey, George.
How's Nancy doing?

04:42.824 --> 04:45.410
I moved out yesterday,
so I haven't seen her.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.497
Um, she's totally fine.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.457
Yeah, no. She-She's
staying out of trouble.

04:50.457 --> 04:54.628
Bye.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.963
NANCY:
I've never seen her before.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.841
Yet she clearly knew you.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.259
I'm known for solving cases
around town.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.345
Maybe she needed my help
with something.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.972
Right.
The Hero of Horseshoe Bay.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.390
Great fansite, by the way.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.809
Well, thank you.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.770
Did you notice the, uh,
numbers on her hand?

05:14.814 --> 05:18.735
No. I'm an incredibly
unobservant detective.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.278
They mean anything to you?

05:20.278 --> 05:22.364
No.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.364
All right.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.324
We're done here.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.829
You know, it is weird, though,
that she was seen

05:29.829 --> 05:32.624
running out of Gorham Woods
on a full moon.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.209
I mean, you know
what they say.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.795
What do they say?

05:36.795 --> 05:39.839
Just that the woods are haunted
by the Gorham Wraith.

05:39.839 --> 05:43.009
It's a phantom that rises
with the full moon,

05:43.009 --> 05:45.679
and feeds on the fear
of those lost in the woods.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.681
It draws you
deeper and deeper in

05:47.681 --> 05:49.599
until you can't find
your way out.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.476
It's the last anybody
ever hears from you.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.394
Cute.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.356
You can go now.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.442
I just...

05:59.442 --> 06:01.486
I hope
she wakes up soon...

06:03.488 --> 06:05.699
...gives you the answers
you're looking for.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.077
Well, let's hope her answers
corroborate yours.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.056
Hey. Carson's gone.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.058
How's Jane Doe?

06:32.058 --> 06:36.354
She is still unconscious, but
she's got a great handshake.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.066
That is "Aglaeca" hidden in
the code written on her hand.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.652
How do you have the bandwidth
for another mystery right now?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.654
Because I think that
Jane Doe's mystery

06:44.654 --> 06:46.531
has something to do with ours.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.870
ACE: Thanks for making sure
I don't die in there

06:51.870 --> 06:53.455
with my bloodied,
writhing body hanging

06:53.455 --> 06:54.873
in what was once my happy place.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.499
Hey, Nancy was right.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.086
Spiraling about fear
won't get us anywhere.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.796
She was just saying that
for morale.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.298
I don't think
she believes it herself.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.299
It's not like you to have doubts

07:04.299 --> 07:05.884
about Nancy.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.677
You were ready
to drink poison for her.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.055
I knew that was water.
This is not water.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.265
This is a death curse
which we only caught

07:12.265 --> 07:14.267
because we helped Nancy
call to the Aglaeca.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.518
Well, if you
blame Nancy,

07:15.518 --> 07:17.604
why are you hacking for her
right now?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.439
Enlightened
self-preservation.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.441
Code might be Aglaeca-related.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.153
Whoa, where is that coming from?

07:32.994 --> 07:36.164
I believe that's Aglaeca
for "don't mess with me."

07:36.164 --> 07:37.832
(door opens)

07:37.832 --> 07:39.042
Did you find anything
from the code?

07:40.043 --> 07:41.544
Uh, yeah.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.423
Led to an anonymizing browser
and an encrypted outbox,

07:45.423 --> 07:47.175
which...

07:47.175 --> 07:48.802
I just cracked.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.971
And it contained a single

07:51.971 --> 07:54.432
outgoing message

07:54.432 --> 07:57.227
directed to you, Nancy.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.104
NANCY:
"Nancy Drew,
I have a mirror

07:59.104 --> 08:01.106
"that can be used
against the Aglaeca.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.651
"Be at the old hatchery barn
outside Gorham Woods

08:04.651 --> 08:06.486
at 1:00 a.m.
Bring the cash."

08:06.486 --> 08:07.821
What cash?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.447
Wait, someone
wants to sell us

08:09.447 --> 08:11.408
an Aglaeca-fighting
mirror?

08:11.408 --> 08:13.535
Someone and her partner.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.578
Look, that's a man's hand
in the photo.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.163
NICK:
Hey, 1:00 a.m.
was 30 minutes ago.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.498
He could still be there.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.958
Maybe he waited.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.958
GEORGE:
Hold up.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.584
Before we go galloping
off into the Gorham Woods

08:21.584 --> 08:23.128
on a full moon,
how do we know

08:23.128 --> 08:24.921
that this mirror can help
us fight the Aglaeca?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.881
Yeah, and how did Jane Doe
and her MIA partner

08:26.881 --> 08:28.383
know we even needed help?

08:28.383 --> 08:30.677
I give you a tweet

08:30.677 --> 08:32.887
from @NancyDrewNews.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.349
"Nancy needs your help.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.978
"Cash reward for any leads
related to the fearsome Aglaeca.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.354
#MatterOfLifeOrDeath."

08:41.354 --> 08:42.856
I did not post that.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.023
I sure as hell
didn't.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.567
And I'm not
on social media.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.776
Guess who is.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.989
Okay, yeah, I sent out an SOS.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.450
You Twitter-sourced
our death premonitions,

08:53.450 --> 08:55.285
and you offered a reward.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.412
Okay, you know when you
have a vision

08:57.412 --> 08:58.663
of yourself as a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e,

08:58.663 --> 09:00.331
it's-it's a good time
to try things.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.459
Oh, and, um, Nick.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.754
D-Do you mind lending me
the-the 750 bucks?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.213
GEORGE:
$750 for what?

09:07.213 --> 09:08.840
We still have no idea

09:08.840 --> 09:11.050
if this mirror has anything
to do with the Aglaeca.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.305
We do.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.514
And it does.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.099
I recognize the snake carvings.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.934
I-It belonged to
the Women in White--

09:19.934 --> 09:22.103
the first people
who called to the Aglaeca.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.272
See? Progress.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.732
ACE:
Don't forget,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.275
this still leaves us in
the middle of some haunted woods

09:27.275 --> 09:28.693
on a full moon.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.153
There's nothing to say
that the wraith

09:30.153 --> 09:31.780
isn't urban legend.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.365
Except centuries of
lore and superstition,

09:34.365 --> 09:37.327
and the occasional person
who was never seen again.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.578
And the fact that every
urban legend we encounter

09:38.578 --> 09:40.955
in Horseshoe Bay
turns out to be real.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.332
Okay. Oh, dear.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.666
Devil's advocate.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.293
So far, we've been
playing defense

09:45.293 --> 09:47.170
against a bunch of
hallucinations.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.922
At least we know
this mirror exists.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.134
A lead worth following.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.553
Only one we got.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.138
Who's in?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.648
(crickets chirping)

10:07.941 --> 10:09.526
NANCY:
Looks like no one's here.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.827
I found a lighter.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.704
(loud clattering)

10:21.704 --> 10:23.581
Whoa.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.791
(whispers):
Sorry.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.840
Hey, Nick. Shine
a light over here.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.804
Oh. I got a phone.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.391
Hey. And some...

10:41.391 --> 10:44.811
kind of medication or drug.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.563
It's still sealed.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.152
I'll get it unlocked.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.821
It's some kind of messaging app.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.740
Gil, where are you?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.740
NANCY:
That's our Jane Doe.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.993
Keep your pants on, Amanda.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.995
Leaving the lodge now,
all right? I got it.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.629
(chuckles):
Who's that handsome devil?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.256
Send the picture I just took,

11:13.256 --> 11:14.799
the message, encrypt it all.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.302
Hey, code's on your hand.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.636
Don't screw this up.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.722
Don't patronize me.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.644
GIL:
Fine.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.105
But only because
you're two minutes older.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.315
Twins.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.025
BESS:
Okay, so why
did they use

11:32.025 --> 11:33.526
the video messages?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.445
It's a dark web app.
They expire

11:35.445 --> 11:37.864
in a matter of hours and
the police can't trace them.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.699
Um, by the way,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.785
you have an hour
to refill your pump.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.370
You're welcome.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.122
(shrieking)

11:44.370 --> 11:46.122
Wha...? Gil?

11:46.122 --> 11:49.208
Gil? Is that you?

11:49.208 --> 11:52.712
(lighter flicking)

11:49.208 --> 11:52.712
Why isn't this working?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.213
(breath trembling)

11:54.213 --> 11:56.382
Oh, come on, c-come on.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.718
Gil?

11:59.928 --> 12:00.970
Gil?

12:05.308 --> 12:06.684
(shrieking)

12:05.308 --> 12:06.684
(screaming)

12:07.685 --> 12:09.687
(screaming continues)

12:09.687 --> 12:11.814
Get off-- get off me!

12:13.316 --> 12:16.277
Was that the wraith?
So it is real.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.613
No, no, we can't make
anything out from the video.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.823
Whatever it was,
Amanda ran from it,

12:20.823 --> 12:23.117
and she got past the boundary
of the woods.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.453
That's how she escaped, and she
found herself outside this barn.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.413
Right. Well,

12:27.413 --> 12:29.874
we're about a half a mile
from where Amanda was found.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.168
So she must have
kept running west

12:32.168 --> 12:34.671
and then fallen down this slope.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.589
That's where she got
her injuries.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.589
ACE: Amanda said Gil

12:36.589 --> 12:38.383
had to refill his
pump in the video.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.884
A pump could mean
he's diabetic.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.219
I'm willing to bet
that vial

12:41.219 --> 12:43.471
is insulin.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.471
But he

12:41.219 --> 12:43.471
never made it back.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.723
Say something happened to Gil
when he was leaving the lodge.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.101
How far could he be from here
if Amanda expected him back

12:48.101 --> 12:50.186
in an hour?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.186
ACE: There's

12:48.101 --> 12:50.186
an old hunting lodge

12:50.186 --> 12:52.188
on the north edge
of the Gorham Woods.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.774
I used to hike a lot when
I was an Eagle Scout.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.068
Nobody ever seemed
to use the place.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.068
GEORGE: Mm-hmm.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.945
Right here.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.446
Pinecrest Lodge.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.446
BESS:
Yep.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.907
Built in 1850.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.369
Owned by the Hudson
Family Trust.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.958
(quietly):
Of course.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.960
(sighs):
Come on.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.341
(gate creaks)

13:21.592 --> 13:23.386
So, Gil's bootprints
have triangles.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.223
The ground's pretty soft

13:27.223 --> 13:29.017
from yesterday's rain.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.144
I'll take a look around,
see if he left any tracks.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.646
Yeah. I-I'll keep an eye out
for bears.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.732
The rest of us
can head into the lodge

13:35.732 --> 13:38.026
to see if Gil's
still in there.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.204
(lock clicking)

14:00.882 --> 14:03.384
(whispers):
All right, shh, shh.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.136
I can hear a voice.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.515
(whispers):
You're imagining things.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.100
(sighs)

14:16.856 --> 14:19.484
(quiet chatter)

14:19.484 --> 14:21.944
Oh...

14:21.944 --> 14:23.529
Or not.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.365
Mr. Hudson.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.825
I can explain.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.285
By all means.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.710
I'd love to hear it.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.643
Mr. Hudson
will be with you soon.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.811
Please, no.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.938
(panting)

14:56.938 --> 14:58.314
Oh, my God.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.108
Is that a meat hook?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.078
You know, if your grandfather
was gonna kill someone,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.747
this is definitely the
room he would do it in.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.290
Okay, remember, Everett
does not know we are related,

15:16.290 --> 15:17.500
and I'd like
to keep it that way.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.335
But aren't you just
a little bit curious

15:19.335 --> 15:20.711
about all of
this, Nancy?

15:20.711 --> 15:22.088
The-the society,

15:22.088 --> 15:23.881
the-the money...

15:22.088 --> 15:23.881
And the murders

15:23.881 --> 15:26.217
and the... the bullying my
mother into suicidal depression

15:26.217 --> 15:27.885
and the threats
to kill me as a baby?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.595
Yeah, all that happened
before I was even born.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.514
God knows what
he would do to me now.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.099
Yeah, but he is

15:31.514 --> 15:33.099
your blood.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.099
And I am...

15:33.099 --> 15:35.268
nothing like him or the Hudsons.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.270
God, that really doesn't
answer my original concern

15:37.270 --> 15:39.063
about us getting killed

15:39.063 --> 15:41.065
in a room
with very spiky walls.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.192
So, I think that this is where
they bleed out the venison.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.902
And where they keep

15:44.902 --> 15:46.404
their Aglaeca-related
heirlooms.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.447
Gil must have snagged
that mirror off the wall

15:48.447 --> 15:49.907
before Everett got here tonight.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.534
Who would've thought that
Mr. Hudson would be hanging out

15:51.534 --> 15:53.494
here, having some weird
insomniac rich-people gathering?

15:53.494 --> 15:56.289
No, and he clearly
didn't want us to crash.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.291
Otherwise, why would
he put us in here?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.044
EVERETT:
A man has a right

16:02.044 --> 16:04.505
to defend himself
from intruders.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.636
Okay, can I just be straight up?
Is this your killing room?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.388
Who do you think I am?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.765
ACE:
Someone who
kills people.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.434
12 innocent men on a ship.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.978
Also, you put a hit out
on Carson Drew when
he was in prison.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.439
Why so quiet tonight?

16:21.439 --> 16:22.857
I don't know,
it's just I'm thinking

16:22.857 --> 16:24.817
about what you were doing
with your secret council.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.736
My guess is, plotting
to get yourself acquitted

16:26.736 --> 16:28.279
of 12 murders.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.656
Or strategizing my defense
for my upcoming trial.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.159
When you say it out loud,

16:33.159 --> 16:35.578
it sounds downright criminal.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.578
ACE:

16:33.159 --> 16:35.578
Says the man

16:35.578 --> 16:37.371
who put us in a room
full of knives

16:37.371 --> 16:38.456
and a drain on the floor.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.210
Why are you on my property?

16:49.467 --> 16:50.635
Well, Miss Drew?

16:50.635 --> 16:52.178
(door opens)

16:52.178 --> 16:53.387
RYAN:
I invited her.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.024
Well, Nancy isn't
answering my texts...

17:05.024 --> 17:06.692
(sighs):
as usual.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.908
And you know she's gonna figure
out we're together, right?

17:13.908 --> 17:16.661
(sighs):
Uh... maybe we tell her.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.747
Or maybe we let ourselves drown
horrifically in your truck

17:19.747 --> 17:22.541
and get out of a really
awkward conversation.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.169
Look at you,
always finding the bright side.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.379
Yeah.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.595
Hey, this is the last place
Gil was standing before he left

17:34.595 --> 17:36.555
to meet his sister
at the hatchery barn.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.561
And those are
his bootprints.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.567
GEORGE:
Maybe he cut
through the Gorham Woods.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.611
No local would be caught dead
there during a full moon.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.363
Perfect getaway plan.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.365
Yeah, but he didn't
make their meet,

17:54.365 --> 17:55.825
so he's probably
still in that forest.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.951
With the wraith

17:56.951 --> 17:57.910
that could kill us.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.745
One problem at a time.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.666
Come on.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.881
NICK:
Looks like Gil started walking

18:10.881 --> 18:13.092
three yards this way...

18:13.092 --> 18:16.345
He was heading south
towards the hatchery barn.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.930
And he changed direction.

18:20.433 --> 18:24.186
Looks like he...
he started running.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.063
Like he was being chased.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.415
I'm good.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.542
I didn't realize
that Nancy

18:46.542 --> 18:49.170
was gonna come through
the back door,

18:49.170 --> 18:51.797
but I invited her here
because I wanted to thank her.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.215
For?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.925
For finding out
the truth

18:54.925 --> 18:57.303
about Lucy Sable.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.139
Yeah, she told me things
that I needed to know.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.559
Made me realize
how lucky I was

19:03.559 --> 19:05.394
to have her help.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.231
So I figured that
that deserved

19:09.231 --> 19:12.068
a face-to-face
conversation

19:12.068 --> 19:14.904
and a little something
for her troubles.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.660
So you decided

19:21.660 --> 19:24.580
to tip her
in the middle of the night?

19:24.580 --> 19:25.915
Well, yeah.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.209
Soon as she got done working
at that lobster shack.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.669
I mean, come on, she
doesn't set her own hours.

19:30.669 --> 19:34.256
And she felt the need
to bring an entourage with her?

19:34.256 --> 19:36.967
Well, she enjoys
traveling with wingmen.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.220
She's a lot like you
in that way.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.806
You're welcome, Ryan.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.474
I didn't mean to intrude.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.602
I think you and
your father have

19:46.602 --> 19:47.853
some important things
to get back to.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.024
Show your guests out.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.617
You have a lovely home.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.080
When you get back...

20:06.080 --> 20:08.916
you will apologize to my friends
for the interruption.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.085
Those guys?

20:11.085 --> 20:14.004
(scoffs) Come on,
they're not your friends.

20:14.004 --> 20:17.174
No, they're just the
latest group of suits
that you're gonna...

20:17.174 --> 20:19.677
drag into
a risky business venture.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.470
They'll go down
for your actions.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.764
You'll walk away
scot-free.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.100
That's how it
always happens.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.687
But maybe I tell them
to walk away instead.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.272
Hmm.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.441
They can't.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.443
Their fortunes
are tied to mine.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.446
Just as mine
are tied to yours.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.448
If I go down,

20:40.448 --> 20:42.283
I bring you with me.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.454
Hey. Nick just texted.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.955
They found footprints.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.248
Come on.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.334
I'll catch up.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.502
Okay.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.503
Thanks.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.089
Your story was inspired.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.257
You didn't have
to cover for me.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.092
Yeah,
you're right.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.345
Well, especially since the
last time we had a conversation,

21:03.345 --> 21:05.347
you shut the
door in my face.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.975
Although I guess
you saying that you

21:07.975 --> 21:09.059
didn't want me in your life,

21:09.059 --> 21:10.978
that must not apply to...

21:10.978 --> 21:12.646
when you're in a jam?

21:12.646 --> 21:15.274
Okay, well, now that my jam's
concluded, I really have to go.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.317
(stammers)
No.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.069
I want you to keep
it. You earned it.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.696
I don't want any Hudson money.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.198
Well, then don't think
of it as Hudson money.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.033
Think of it as money
from a friend.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.201
Well, if you were my friend,

21:25.201 --> 21:26.494
you wouldn't be
comparing me to Everett.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.872
(sighs)

21:32.583 --> 21:34.376
(crickets chirping)

21:36.462 --> 21:39.215
NANCY:
For the record,
you're not my wingmen.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.341
ACE:
Noted.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.176
You okay?

21:43.511 --> 21:46.305
You want me to tell you you're
nothing like your grandfather?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.433
That you don't... drag your
friends into bad situations?

21:51.060 --> 21:53.604
Yeah. Kinda.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.482
While you walk us
into a haunted forest

21:56.482 --> 21:59.485
to look for a solution
to a fatal curse

21:59.485 --> 22:02.071
that only got triggered
because we helped you.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.155
GEORGE:
Hey, Gil's bootprints

22:03.155 --> 22:04.490
veer off here.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.418
It looked like...

22:16.418 --> 22:18.420
someone
attacked him here.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.005
Ripped off
his insulin pump.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.715
Okay, we really need
to call the police.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.008
Come on.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.552
Still no signal.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.011
NICK:
If he doesn't have
any insulin,

22:26.011 --> 22:27.221
he's running out of time.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.056
This is now
a rescue mission.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.059
â™ª â™ª

22:41.318 --> 22:42.820
Dang it. I lost my
bracelet back there.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.614
Okay, didn't we pass this
tree, like, ten minutes ago?

22:45.614 --> 22:48.450
I can't tell. They're
all starting to look the same.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.999
BESS:
What are those?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.379
ACE:
Scarecrows.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.383
Locals put 'em up
to keep the hikers out.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.136
Um, I always heard
they were to keep the wraith in.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.346
Come on.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.181
The footprints
go this way.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.352
â™ª â™ª

23:38.125 --> 23:40.127
(whimpers, sniffles)

23:40.127 --> 23:42.379
(rustling)

23:42.379 --> 23:46.091
Guys, I really think
we should just go back.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.602
(panting softly)

23:58.437 --> 23:59.855
Oh, God.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.732
Oh.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.734
Okay, that wasn't so bad.

24:03.734 --> 24:04.818
(exhales sharply)

24:04.818 --> 24:06.820
(creaking)

24:08.864 --> 24:11.492
(shrieking)

24:08.864 --> 24:11.492
(screaming)

24:13.994 --> 24:16.038
GEORGE:
Run!

24:16.038 --> 24:17.331
ACE: Go!

24:16.038 --> 24:17.331
BESS: Hurry up!

24:17.331 --> 24:18.666
ACE:
Don't look back, go!

24:21.043 --> 24:22.127
GEORGE:
Run!

24:23.253 --> 24:24.505
Over here!

24:25.798 --> 24:28.425
ACE:
Run! Go!

24:31.512 --> 24:33.472
â™ª â™ª

24:34.723 --> 24:36.642
Come on.

24:36.642 --> 24:40.229
Come on, come on,
come on, get on quick.

24:40.229 --> 24:43.190
(panting)

24:40.229 --> 24:43.190
Are you okay?

24:43.190 --> 24:45.150
I was so cold.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.068
MAN: Hands inside
the windows, please.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.068
(gasps)

24:46.068 --> 24:47.945
Who said that?

24:47.945 --> 24:50.239
As impressed as I am
that you found me,

24:50.239 --> 24:52.032
I don't want to get killed
by that scary-ass thing

24:52.032 --> 24:53.909
in the woods.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.577
Gil Bobbsey.

24:55.577 --> 24:56.787
(breathing heavily)

24:56.787 --> 24:59.248
Nancy Drew.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.874
Did you bring it?

25:00.874 --> 25:03.127
Your insulin pump? Yeah, I fou--
we found it in the woods...

25:03.127 --> 25:05.003
No, no, no. Forget
that. The money.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.089
Did you bring the money?

25:07.089 --> 25:09.091
What?

25:07.089 --> 25:09.091
I believe the terms

25:09.091 --> 25:12.219
were $750 for a mirror
to be used by a certain someone.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.972
Gil, forget the money.
Your body is shutting down.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.683
Let us help you.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.683
All right.
Well, now it's... $850.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.643
Is he negotiating?
How are you negotiating?

25:19.643 --> 25:21.729
What? You know, if you die,
you don't get anything.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.063
If I die,
you don't get the mirror.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.274
(breathing heavily)

25:25.274 --> 25:27.067
Are we having fun yet?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.198
Um...

25:31.488 --> 25:33.198
He's going into shock. Get
him that-- get him that pump.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.200
The c-- the cannula,
the cannula goes into the slot.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.660
It's okay. I got it.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.660
Here, here, here.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.954
NICK:
Okay.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.456
Stay with us.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.249
My dad's diabetic.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.835
(panting)

25:44.835 --> 25:48.172
Okay, okay, okay.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.759
Okay, the insulin's
running again.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.135
GEORGE:
Damn, the Bobbsey twins

25:53.135 --> 25:54.636
are hardcore.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.680
Okay, Nancy.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.765
Does he have
the mirror or not?

25:57.765 --> 25:58.974
Let's find out.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.690
Uh-uh.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.275
Don't try and steal
from a thief.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.860
Payment first.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.739
Wait, where-where's my sister?

26:13.739 --> 26:15.449
The hospital.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.159
Why? What happened?

26:17.159 --> 26:18.660
The wraith got to her first.
But she's--

26:18.660 --> 26:20.537
She escaped. She's fine.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.289
I have to see her.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.582
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.582
Hey, no, no.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.417
We can't go anywhere.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.502
No, the wraith
is out there.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.878
So you, uh,

26:27.878 --> 26:29.213
had a run-in, too?

26:29.213 --> 26:31.340
How long are
we safe in here?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.008
That depends
on how it finds its victims.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.134
Well, according
to local legend,

26:34.134 --> 26:35.803
it sniffs you out by your fear.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.763
So just don't
be afraid?

26:37.763 --> 26:40.474
It will find us and kill us all.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.518
â™ª â™ª

26:50.275 --> 26:51.401
(panting)

26:51.401 --> 26:52.903
GIL:
So, we, uh,

26:52.903 --> 26:54.696
got some Aglaeca trouble, do we?

26:54.696 --> 26:56.073
How'd you
piss her off?

26:56.073 --> 26:57.574
Okay, you know what,
I thought we were trying

26:57.574 --> 26:59.785
to not be afraid.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.785
You start.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.537
What do you know
about the mirror?

27:01.537 --> 27:03.080
I remembered seeing it

27:03.080 --> 27:04.748
in the Hudsons' lodge
when I was a kid.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.667
My dad was
the caretaker.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.585
He said that the
mirror belonged

27:08.585 --> 27:11.630
to a Hudson ancestor.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.883
One of the first women
to call out the Aglaeca.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.385
Okay.
Apple don't fall far.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.011
(shriek in distance)

27:18.011 --> 27:20.013
BESS:
Okay.

27:20.013 --> 27:20.806
It could be a deer.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.140
You know,
do...

27:22.140 --> 27:23.684
do deers make
that sound?

27:23.684 --> 27:25.269
GIL:
Only if something terrible's
happening

27:25.269 --> 27:26.603
to them.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.313
I don't see anything.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.066
We got to ignore our fear.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.819
Otherwise we're like,
um, catnip to the wraith.

27:33.819 --> 27:34.611
Right?

27:34.611 --> 27:36.154
(skittering)

27:36.154 --> 27:37.489
Okay. Don't think
about the wraith.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.574
Think about...

27:38.574 --> 27:39.741
think about happier times
before now.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.327
Uh, go.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.328
Uh, okay.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.705
This-this summer.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.748
Um... Fourth of July.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.876
It was my first fireworks
in Horseshoe Bay.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.460
You see, I like
sparkly things.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.129
They-they
calm me.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.171
They have s...

27:52.129 --> 27:53.171
(loud bang)

27:53.171 --> 27:54.631
(shouts)

27:54.631 --> 27:57.134
Okay, eyes on me.
I-I remem-- I remember that.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.844
That was my first day
at The Claw.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.054
And the first day
that we were all together.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.306
Yeah.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.306
BESS: Yeah,

28:01.054 --> 28:02.306
that was a good day.

28:02.306 --> 28:03.891
NANCY:
Yeah.

28:02.306 --> 28:03.891
It was.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.726
GEORGE:
It was okay.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.603
No, it was terrible.

28:07.603 --> 28:08.645
Right this way.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.397
(thunder rumbling)

28:08.645 --> 28:10.397
(rain falling)

28:12.816 --> 28:14.985
Drew, where's that halibut
for table nine?

28:18.238 --> 28:19.281
(shattering)

28:19.281 --> 28:20.782
BESS:
Ace!

28:19.281 --> 28:20.782
Bess is in trouble.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.535
Ace, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't realize.

28:23.535 --> 28:27.080
I-I-I just-- The plates
are slippy, and I didn't...

28:27.080 --> 28:29.666
Oh... I'm sorry, okay?

28:32.586 --> 28:35.631
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

28:32.586 --> 28:35.631
S-- I'm sorry. I'm-- My fault.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.591
No, I'm s... I'm sorry.
No, my-my fault. Um...

28:40.677 --> 28:43.013
Uh, could I, uh...
could I...

28:43.013 --> 28:45.807
could I get a coffee to go,
please?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.101
(exhales)

28:48.101 --> 28:49.937
NANCY:
Yeah, it was terrible.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.857
And then it wasn't.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.069
Eventually, the rain stopped.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.987
The fireworks
started.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.198
I got my sisters.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.198
Mm-hmm.

29:01.198 --> 29:02.866
I took Florence.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.160
I met somebody
by the pier.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.455
Or I-I bumped
into him again.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.250
â™ª â™ª

29:13.961 --> 29:15.087
GIL:
You know, I never thought

29:15.087 --> 29:17.297
I'd actually say this,
but, uh...

29:17.297 --> 29:19.007
your stories...

29:19.007 --> 29:20.300
have me rooting for the wraith.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.719
It all...

29:22.719 --> 29:24.638
led us to each other.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.934
(quietly):
It did.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.018
(loud bang)

29:28.934 --> 29:30.018
(shrieking)

29:30.018 --> 29:31.728
Did you hear that?!

29:31.728 --> 29:33.522
Don't think about it, Bess.
It's okay.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.982
BESS:
Okay, okay, everything is good.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.982
Okay?

29:34.982 --> 29:37.317
Everything is great.

29:34.982 --> 29:37.317
(rattling)

29:37.317 --> 29:38.110
(screaming)

29:37.317 --> 29:38.110
(wraith shrieking)

29:38.110 --> 29:39.152
NANCY:
Stay calm.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.404
Stay calm.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.655
It-it can't find us

29:41.655 --> 29:42.948
if we're not afraid.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.324
(screaming)

29:44.324 --> 29:46.785
Okay, we have

29:44.324 --> 29:46.785
to get out of here.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.785
(rattling)

29:46.785 --> 29:48.453
GEORGE:
Go! The front door!

29:46.785 --> 29:48.453
Nancy, come on!

29:48.453 --> 29:50.122
Come on!

29:48.453 --> 29:50.122
No. No! It will only follow us.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.164
We got to get out of here.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.124
(thumping)

29:51.164 --> 29:52.124
No, let the others go.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.542
If it can only sense my fear,

29:53.542 --> 29:55.502
then it'll give them
enough time to run.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.379
Hey, look,
you can't sacrifice yourself.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.715
I will not let my
friends get killed.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.092
(thumping)

30:02.092 --> 30:03.802
Go!

30:03.802 --> 30:06.179
(creaking)

30:03.802 --> 30:06.179
(wraith snarling)

30:06.179 --> 30:08.682

30:08.682 --> 30:10.183
GEORGE:
Where's Nancy?

30:11.393 --> 30:12.310
(thumping)

30:12.310 --> 30:13.770
(screams)

30:13.770 --> 30:15.981
(panting)

30:15.981 --> 30:18.025

30:18.025 --> 30:20.027
â™ª â™ª

30:23.363 --> 30:24.573
LUCY:
Don't let the Hudsons know
about her.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.367
(shrieks)

30:26.033 --> 30:27.367
KATE:
See me

30:27.367 --> 30:29.661
sitting under a big green tree.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.455
I love you.

30:31.455 --> 30:32.873
(breathing shakily)

30:32.873 --> 30:34.041
(whispers):
Not that. Not that. Not that.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.967
I'm afraid.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.470
I'm afraid of me.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.638
I'm afraid
that I don't know who I am,

30:48.638 --> 30:51.683
that I-I'm just the worst
parts of all of them, that...

30:51.683 --> 30:53.018
(screams)

30:51.683 --> 30:53.018
(shrieks)

30:55.562 --> 30:56.980
(snarling)

31:00.609 --> 31:03.278
(shrieks)

31:03.278 --> 31:04.863
Oh, it's scared of fire.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.745
(mutters)

31:17.876 --> 31:19.711
(gasping)

31:19.711 --> 31:20.796
(shrieking)

31:26.718 --> 31:28.720
Nancy, come on.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.640
(Nancy coughing)

31:41.108 --> 31:44.778
(wraith shrieks)

31:52.327 --> 31:55.330
Hey. Thank you.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.332
For the assist.

31:57.332 --> 32:01.128
$750.

31:57.332 --> 32:01.128
You mean $950?

32:22.065 --> 32:23.525
There it is.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.110
Can you hold this?

32:29.281 --> 32:31.908
I learned this on a bungalow
case in middle school.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.577
(gasps)

32:35.036 --> 32:36.246
Can I get a knife?

32:36.246 --> 32:39.082
Not your first
mirror mystery, huh?

32:49.176 --> 32:51.761
Whoa.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.761
"From sailor's lips,

32:51.761 --> 32:54.181
"s-sweet songs were spun,

32:54.181 --> 32:57.559
"but for the Aglaeca,
only lies were spun.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.769
"Dark spirit you seek,
keeper of the deep.

32:59.769 --> 33:04.065
Her truth lies hidden
in their sea shanty."

33:04.065 --> 33:07.319
So, the key
to defeating the Aglaeca

33:07.319 --> 33:09.404
is hidden in a sea shanty?

33:09.404 --> 33:11.239
Like, a sailor's song?

33:09.404 --> 33:11.239
What, from the 1800s?

33:11.239 --> 33:14.034
(siren wails)

33:11.239 --> 33:14.034
Where are we gonna find...?

33:22.792 --> 33:24.419
(car doors open and close)

33:25.962 --> 33:27.589
Nancy Drew.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.466
What's that old saying?

33:29.466 --> 33:32.010
Where there's smoke,
there's a miscreant teen sleuth

33:32.010 --> 33:33.803
who's about to be arrested?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.803
NICK:

33:32.010 --> 33:33.803
Arrested?

33:33.803 --> 33:36.014
On what grounds?

33:33.803 --> 33:36.014
TAMURA:

33:33.803 --> 33:36.014
Possession of stolen property.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.308
I got a positive ID

33:38.308 --> 33:40.644
on Amanda
right after Nancy left.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.395
Oh, and you're not the only ones
who know how to decrypt messages

33:42.395 --> 33:43.605
from the dark web.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.440
When the rangers
reported that fire this morning,

33:45.440 --> 33:46.608
I figured it was you.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.652
Mr. Bobbsey,

33:48.652 --> 33:52.030
while you and your sister
may not be identical,

33:52.030 --> 33:54.074
your rap sheets certainly are.

33:54.074 --> 33:55.825
Yeah, well, if you don't want me
to resist arrest,

33:55.825 --> 33:57.494
I need to see my sister.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.873
(car door opens)

34:00.121 --> 34:01.873
Nancy.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.251
Gilbert.

34:04.251 --> 34:07.170
Your chariot awaits.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.190
I can't believe
you fell asleep on the job.

34:27.190 --> 34:30.527
Easiest $950 we ever made.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.112
(both chuckle)

34:38.827 --> 34:40.453
Let me guess.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.455
Tacking on a few more
charges? See what sticks?

34:42.455 --> 34:44.249
Nope.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.042
Please turn around.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.589
(handcuffs clicking)

34:50.463 --> 34:51.589
It's your lucky night.

34:51.589 --> 34:54.426
So, I am growing on you.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.970
Incorrect.

34:56.970 --> 34:59.180
And I'm not the one
who let you off the hook.

35:11.026 --> 35:14.279
Thanks for not pressing charges
about the stolen mirror.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.531
I told the police
it was a gift.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.533
A token of my
family's appreciation

35:18.533 --> 35:20.118
for all your hard work.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.412
You were gonna tip me again?

35:22.412 --> 35:24.539
I'm touched.

35:24.539 --> 35:27.625
(chuckles)
Well, what I didn't tell them

35:27.625 --> 35:29.878
was you can't steal
a family heirloom

35:29.878 --> 35:32.672
when it belongs to
your actual family.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.177
This is yours.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.821
Wow. Rough night?

35:56.821 --> 35:59.616
I was with a client.

36:02.369 --> 36:05.121
RYAN:
Who, him? Oh, you are

36:05.121 --> 36:07.040
rebuilding your practice
from the ground up

36:07.040 --> 36:08.625
because I fired you, huh?

36:08.625 --> 36:11.628
Because I was wrongfully
accused of murder.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.005
Not great for business.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.841
What's going on with Nancy?

36:16.841 --> 36:19.302
I saw you with her.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.302
Yeah, that's-that's between

36:19.302 --> 36:21.513
her and I.
It's a family matter.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.641
If she's in trouble,
that's something that...

36:21.513 --> 36:24.641
If she's in trouble, it doesn't

36:24.641 --> 36:27.060
concern you, Carson.
She made that perfectly clear.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.478
A-And listen, before you go

36:28.478 --> 36:31.314
and you get in my face about it,
please, just remember

36:31.314 --> 36:34.526
I can tell this entire town
exactly who Nancy is.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.986
And getting charged
for kidnapping, now, that...

36:36.986 --> 36:39.322
that wouldn't be great
for business either.

36:42.242 --> 36:43.993
Are you threatening me?

36:43.993 --> 36:45.912
No. No.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.705
Just letting you know

36:47.705 --> 36:49.249
that I could ruin you
if I chose to.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.044
But, hey.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.421
Don't let me hold you up.

36:54.421 --> 36:56.256
Meal ticket's
waiting for you.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.847
NICK:
No way.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.314
I thought you got rid of it.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.525
BESS:
Um, yeah, I did.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.694
(clang)

37:17.694 --> 37:20.780
Nickerson.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.491
You parked your truck on
our lot with this on it.

37:24.701 --> 37:28.288
"Please crush this

37:24.701 --> 37:28.288
in your truck crusher.

37:28.288 --> 37:30.999
TYSSM."

37:30.999 --> 37:33.835
First off, we don't
operate on a note system.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.504
Okay, that was me.
I'm-I'm sorry.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.006
It doesn't matter anyway.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.924
I had to shut down
early this morning.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.634
Must've been a water
main break or something,

37:41.634 --> 37:43.678
'cause the whole
junkyard's flooded.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.431
Hey. Uh, hey.
Uh, you want to buy it?

37:46.431 --> 37:48.892
Uh, the price is low.

37:48.892 --> 37:50.268
I-I'm practically
giving it away.

37:48.892 --> 37:50.268
(chains rattle)

37:50.268 --> 37:52.604
In fact, in fact, Fred,
for you, I will give it away.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.856
(chuckles)
Water damage like that?

37:54.856 --> 37:56.774
God knows what it's
done to the engine.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.860
Sorry, pal.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.070
No one's taking that thing off
your hands. You're out of luck.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.072
Yeah.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.200
Thanks.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.496
(sighs)

38:09.496 --> 38:13.333
If I were to roll this truck
off a cliff,

38:13.333 --> 38:14.751
what do you want to bet...

38:14.751 --> 38:16.503
It would land on a
flock of seagulls

38:16.503 --> 38:18.338
that would fly its ass
right back up here?

38:18.338 --> 38:20.381
I'd bet it all, baby.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.677
The Aglaeca wants us
to die in this truck.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.107
Hey.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.782
I know that you blame me

38:45.782 --> 38:48.326
for getting us
into this situation.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.038
And I really want
to make it right,

38:52.038 --> 38:55.959
but I can't do that
if you're mad at me.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.921
What I'm mad at

38:59.921 --> 39:03.466
is the idea that I
might die very soon.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.468
Right when I'm finally
figuring out how to be

39:05.468 --> 39:07.804
a part of something
I really care about.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.936
'Cause I've never had a crew

39:14.936 --> 39:17.397
like us.

39:17.397 --> 39:20.191
I'm not gonna let us die.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.193
I never doubted that.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.696
So, you're still mad?

39:25.905 --> 39:28.658
I'm scared.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.870
Sometimes
you just have to let fear be.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.915
(locker opens)

39:35.915 --> 39:38.501
The next time you feel
like sacrificing yourself

39:38.501 --> 39:41.170
to prove you're not a Hudson,
please don't.

39:41.170 --> 39:44.132
(locker closes)

39:44.132 --> 39:46.467
Just 'cause I'm mad at you
doesn't mean I want to lose you.

39:57.895 --> 40:01.399

NANCY:
I still may not know who I am,

40:12.744 --> 40:14.287
but if I'm ever gonna
figure it out,

40:14.287 --> 40:16.414
I have to find a way
to survive this curse.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.542
If not for myself,
then for my friends.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.590
Time to go find a sea shanty.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.886
