Great!
To start today's adventure,

everybody say
the pirate password...

01:12.706 --> 01:14.773
Yo-ho-ho!

[Mr. Smee] Oh, careful, boys!

01:29.657 --> 01:35.027
The cap'n has had that old
treasure chest ever since
he was a wee pirate lad.

01:35.029 --> 01:38.430
And it holds some of me
most valuable treasures.

01:38.432 --> 01:43.335
- Like golden gold?
- And jewels,
shiny and sparkly-like?

01:43.337 --> 01:46.839
Oh, much more
valuable than that.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.807
'Tis me trumpet!

01:48.809 --> 01:52.177
One of the very first
treasures I ever found.

01:52.179 --> 01:56.215
- [blows discordant note]
- [wind howling]

01:56.217 --> 01:58.283
Storm's a-brewin'!

01:58.285 --> 02:00.586
[thunder crashes]

02:01.888 --> 02:02.788
Ah!

02:04.624 --> 02:06.525
Me treasure!

02:08.061 --> 02:11.196
- Waves away!
- Gangway!

02:11.198 --> 02:16.235
- Yay-hey! [laughs]
- Whoo-hoo! [laughs]

02:16.237 --> 02:19.538
Look alive, me hearties!
A ship's coming in.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.573
A ship in a bottle!

02:23.576 --> 02:24.977
Cool! Let's check it out!

02:24.979 --> 02:27.346
[gasps] Those puny pirates

02:27.348 --> 02:29.014
have found something.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.084
Methinks it's me
treasured trumpet!

02:32.086 --> 02:34.119
Cap'n, do you really
think it's...

02:34.121 --> 02:36.421
Captain Hook does
not need to think!

02:36.423 --> 02:39.691
I am certain they have
found me trumpet!

02:39.693 --> 02:45.230
- You know what to do, boys.
- [Sharky, Bones] Set sail
for Pirate Island!

02:46.766 --> 02:50.269
I wonder how long
this ship-in-a-bottle's
been floating.

02:53.239 --> 02:57.643
Whoo-hoo!
It sure is great to be free!

02:57.645 --> 03:00.646
There's never enough room
in that bottle! Ha-ha!

03:00.648 --> 03:04.917
Shiver me timbers!
Who are you?!

03:04.919 --> 03:07.519
I'm Pip, the Pirate Genie.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.688
You're a genuine genie?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.591
One hundred percent,
through and through!

03:12.593 --> 03:15.527
- From me head to me toes!
- Wow!

03:15.529 --> 03:18.096
Are you the kind of genie
that makes wishes come true?

03:18.098 --> 03:20.766
Aye, but not just
any old wishes.

03:20.768 --> 03:25.904
I'm a pirate genie.
And that means I make wishes
for treasure come true!

03:25.906 --> 03:29.241
<i>¶ I'm a genuine genie</i>
<i>of the pirate sort ¶</i>

03:29.243 --> 03:31.710
¶ And I grant treasure-wishes

03:31.712 --> 03:35.047
<i>¶ For galleons, jewels</i>
<i>or gold doubloons ¶</i>

03:35.049 --> 03:37.883
<i>¶ Or a tail</i>
<i>like a mermaid fish's ¶</i>

03:37.885 --> 03:41.153
<i>¶ I never met a matey</i>
<i>on the Never Sea ¶</i>

03:41.155 --> 03:44.056
<i>¶ Or anywhere else at that </i>

03:44.058 --> 03:47.259
<i>¶ Who didn't have a hundred</i>
<i>treasure wishes ¶</i>

03:47.261 --> 03:49.795
<i>¶ Under their pirate hat </i>

03:49.797 --> 03:52.998
<i>- ¶ What be your wish? </i>
<i>- ¶ Your treasure wish </i>

03:53.000 --> 03:55.867
<i>- ¶ What be your wish? </i>
<i>- ¶ Your treasure wish </i>

03:55.869 --> 03:58.670
<i>¶ You can wish for treasure</i>
<i>great or grand ¶</i>

03:58.672 --> 04:04.109
<i>¶ 'Cause your wish</i>
<i>be my command ¶</i>

04:04.111 --> 04:06.211
- Yo-ho!
- Awesome!

04:06.213 --> 04:09.648
- Yippee!
- I want a hang-glider that
can turn into a sail wagon.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.150
I want a skateboard ramp taller
than Never-Ever Peak Mountain!

04:12.152 --> 04:14.319
I want a music box
that plays every song!

04:14.321 --> 04:17.623
- And I want a box of crackers
that's never empty...
- Whoa, whoa!

04:17.625 --> 04:22.094
- Hold onto your bandanas!
- OK, but let's not
hold on too long.

04:22.096 --> 04:25.464
I'll probably think
of a kajillion more
things to wish for.

04:25.466 --> 04:29.935
Oh, no. You see, there be pirate
genie-rules to treasure-wishing.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.005
The crew that sets me free
and keeps a hold of me bottle

04:33.007 --> 04:35.707
gets one treasure-wish
per matey.

04:35.709 --> 04:40.646
And since there be one,
two, three, four of ye,
four wishes is what ya get.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.348
[Cubby] Yay-hey!
This is gonna be awesome!

04:43.350 --> 04:46.385
Oh, awesome, indeed!

04:46.387 --> 04:50.022
Why, my wish has
already come true!

04:50.024 --> 04:52.090
What wish might
that be, cap'n?

04:52.092 --> 04:56.261
That there is a genie who
can grant wishes for treasure,

04:56.263 --> 04:58.330
and you know how
I loves me treasure.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.999
- [both] Oh, that we do!
- [thunder crashes]

05:01.001 --> 05:03.135
[all shout]

05:03.137 --> 05:06.438
Stormin' crackers!
Thar she blows!

05:06.440 --> 05:08.707
Whoa! You said it, Feathers!

05:08.709 --> 05:11.677
If we don't find cover soon,
we'll all be blown away!

05:11.679 --> 05:16.281
- To the Hideout, crew!
- [all shouting]

05:21.554 --> 05:24.256
Where'd everybody go?

05:24.258 --> 05:27.526
Hey! Nice place
you got here, mates.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.662
Looks like it has everything
a pirate could ever want.

05:30.664 --> 05:35.067
Yep, our hideout's pretty fun
all right, but can we start
making our treasure-wishes?

05:35.069 --> 05:38.537
[laughs] Well,
might as well try. So...

05:38.539 --> 05:40.272
...treasure-wish away!

05:40.274 --> 05:45.377
I treasure-wish for a music box
that'll play whatever song
I wanna hear!

05:45.379 --> 05:48.513
Uh, OK. Here it goes.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.550
To the little lady
from Never Land,

05:51.552 --> 05:54.753
your treasure-wish
is my command!

05:55.888 --> 05:58.123
- [frog croaks]
- Whoa!

05:58.125 --> 06:02.127
- I wasn't expecting that!
- Let me try again.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.297
- Oh!
- Hey!

06:05.299 --> 06:07.899
Shiver me toads!

06:07.901 --> 06:12.137
- What was that all about?
- Pip, is there something wrong?

06:12.139 --> 06:15.107
Well, truth is,
there is something wrong.

06:15.109 --> 06:18.076
You see, my treasure-wishing
power is running out.

06:18.078 --> 06:21.279
There's gotta be a way for you
to get your wishing power back.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.883
There is!
The Treasure-Wishing Well.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.687
It holds the magic
that can help me restore
my treasure-wishing power!

06:28.689 --> 06:32.424
I've been looking everywhere
for it and Never Land
is my last hope.

06:32.426 --> 06:36.661
Pip, do you have any clue where
on Never Land the well might be?

06:36.663 --> 06:40.599
I've got a bunch of clues.
It's all in the
Pirate Genie Code.

06:40.601 --> 06:44.636
"First you must go somewhere,
then find leaves
that point the way

06:44.638 --> 06:48.840
to a vast giant canyon where
the winds blow night and day.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.411
Then you'll end up nowhere,
and ancient rocks will tell

06:52.413 --> 06:56.081
the straight and twisty path
to the Treasure-Wishing Well."

06:56.083 --> 06:59.551
Cubby, maybe you can help Pip
find the Treasure-Wishing Well.

06:59.553 --> 07:03.021
Sure thing, Jake.
Hey, check this out.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.958
The Pirate Genie Code says that
we gotta go somewhere, right?

07:06.960 --> 07:12.063
Well, here's a place
we've never been to before:
the Valley of Somewhere.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.899
Wish-tastic!

07:13.901 --> 07:16.568
Mateys, let's help
Pip the Pirate Genie

07:16.570 --> 07:19.037
get his treasure-wishing
power back!

07:19.039 --> 07:21.306
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.910
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,
they'll appear.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.879
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

07:27.881 --> 07:31.383
- Is everybody ready?
- I got my sword,

07:31.385 --> 07:33.919
and the Pirate Genie's
ship-in-a-bottle.

07:33.921 --> 07:37.589
- I got my map!
- And I've got my Pixie Dust!

07:37.591 --> 07:41.092
And I'm ready to get my
treasure-wishing power back!

07:41.094 --> 07:45.197
Then yo-ho, let's go find
the Treasure-Wishing Well!

07:47.934 --> 07:51.036
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

07:51.038 --> 07:53.505
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

07:53.507 --> 07:54.906
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

07:54.908 --> 07:58.176
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

07:58.178 --> 08:01.246
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

08:01.248 --> 08:04.616
<i>¶ And me </i>

08:04.618 --> 08:07.853
Oh! There goes
that plucky Bucky,

08:07.855 --> 08:11.323
with the sea pups,
oh, and the genie! [laughs]

08:11.325 --> 08:14.259
Follow that genie!

08:15.127 --> 08:16.228
Ah!

08:16.230 --> 08:18.363
Once I get me
treasure-wishing power back,

08:18.365 --> 08:23.168
- I'll be as good as new!
- Great! 'Cause I got a big
treasure-wish to make!

08:23.170 --> 08:27.072
- What would you wish for, Pip?
- No one's ever
asked me that before.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.608
Hm... I know!

08:30.743 --> 08:33.178
I would treasure-wish
for a pirate ship

08:33.180 --> 08:38.350
big enough so that I could
sail the Never Sea and go on
adventures, like you mates!

08:38.352 --> 08:42.320
But a Pirate Genie
isn't powerful enough
to grant a wish for themselves.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.789
Rotten berries, that's not fair!

08:44.791 --> 08:47.526
Heads up, mateys!
We've reached Somewhere:

08:47.528 --> 08:49.961
The Valley of Somewhere.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.398
- But it looks like
a whole lot of nothing.
- Hold on, Cubby.

08:53.400 --> 08:59.004
Remember, "First you must go
somewhere, then find leaves
that point the way."

08:59.006 --> 09:03.742
Well, we're somewhere,
but there aren't any leaves
to point the way.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.077
Ahoy, me hearties! Look!

09:06.079 --> 09:10.582
There are drawings of leaves
on the ground that point
the way out of the valley.

09:10.584 --> 09:15.287
Way to go! We found the leaves
that point the way to the
Treasure-Wishing Well,

09:15.289 --> 09:17.389
and we got three gold doubloons.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.391
Let's grab 'em and go!

09:19.393 --> 09:24.829
The code said, "First you must
go somewhere, then find
leaves that point the way

09:24.831 --> 09:29.935
to a vast, giant canyon where
the winds blow night and day."

09:29.937 --> 09:34.172
Looks like this
is the place, Pip,
a vast giant, windy canyon!

09:34.174 --> 09:38.843
Whoa! It oughta be called
the "Impossible-To-
Get-Across Canyon!"

09:38.845 --> 09:43.615
What's the problem?
We got Pixie Dust.
You guys can just fly across.

09:43.617 --> 09:48.720
No way! The winds are too
strong, even for Pixie Dust!

09:48.722 --> 09:52.123
- Then how are we
gonna get across?
- Let me help.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.927
I've still got a trick
or two up me sleeve. [whistles]

09:59.966 --> 10:04.069
Hop on! All aboard my
magic flying pirate flag!

10:04.071 --> 10:05.403
- All right!
- Cool!

10:05.405 --> 10:07.572
- Coconuts!
- [Captain Hook] Hurry, men!

10:07.574 --> 10:09.507
Catch that flag!

10:09.509 --> 10:12.944
- [grunts]
- [all] Captain Hook?!

10:12.946 --> 10:15.780
- [men shouting]
- What are you doing here?

10:15.782 --> 10:19.351
To put it simply,
I want that Pirate Genie

10:19.353 --> 10:22.053
- to make me treasure-wishes
come true!
- [fabric rips]

10:22.055 --> 10:25.890
- [all shouting]
- [Mr. Smee] The flag,
it's unraveling!

10:25.892 --> 10:29.494
- [shouting]
- Hold on, Captain Hook!

10:31.297 --> 10:33.264
Captain Hook, can we...?

10:33.266 --> 10:35.333
Save your breath,
puny pirates!

10:35.335 --> 10:38.203
I'll have no help
from the likes of you!

10:38.205 --> 10:41.873
Way-hey! We got across
the giant, windy canyon,

10:41.875 --> 10:44.409
and we got
three more gold doubloons!

10:44.411 --> 10:47.245
Let's grab 'em and go!

10:48.581 --> 10:50.115
So where do we go next?

10:50.117 --> 10:52.083
Now we're supposed
to end up nowhere,

10:52.085 --> 10:55.754
and ancient rocks will tell
the straight and twisty path

10:55.756 --> 10:59.491
- to the Treasure-Wishing Well.
- Nowhere, huh?

10:59.493 --> 11:01.693
If there was
a Valley of Somewhere,

11:01.695 --> 11:05.330
maybe there's
a Valley of Nowhere! Huh?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.132
A-ha!

11:07.134 --> 11:11.736
The Pirate Genie's
ship-in-a-bottle is mine!

11:11.738 --> 11:15.106
And you know what that means,
bitty buccaneers?

11:15.108 --> 11:18.543
- That you're a cranky crook?
- No.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.046
It means I, Captain Hook,

11:21.048 --> 11:25.050
am now the master
of the Pirate Genie!

11:25.052 --> 11:27.018
Yay-hey, no way!

11:27.020 --> 11:30.055
Step lively,
Pirate Genie of mine.

11:30.057 --> 11:35.493
I'm looking forward
to you making all me
treasure-wishes come true!

11:35.495 --> 11:39.064
[sighs] Coming, master.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.032
You can't get away
with this, Hook!

11:41.034 --> 11:44.903
Oh, I can and I will!

11:47.373 --> 11:49.874
<i>¶ Which wish will I wish</i>
<i>for me treasure-wish? ¶</i>

11:49.876 --> 11:52.210
<i>¶ Which wish will I wish</i>
<i>to come true? ¶</i>

11:52.212 --> 11:54.412
¶ Emeralds and rubies
to put on me hook ¶

11:54.414 --> 11:56.815
¶ Or a coat
made of gold doubloons ¶

11:56.817 --> 11:59.150
<i>¶ Will I wish to be king</i>
<i>of the Never Sea ¶</i>

11:59.152 --> 12:01.486
<i>¶ With a throne</i>
<i>at the helm of me ship? ¶</i>

12:01.488 --> 12:03.955
<i>¶ And will I sit down</i>
<i>and adjust me crown ¶</i>

12:03.957 --> 12:07.425
<i>¶ Then I'll wish</i>
<i>for another wish? ¶</i>

12:07.427 --> 12:09.928
<i>¶ Which wish will I wish</i>
<i>for me treasure-wish? ¶</i>

12:09.930 --> 12:12.230
<i>¶ He's got more wishes</i>
<i>than a kettle of fishes ¶</i>

12:12.232 --> 12:14.299
<i>¶ Which wish will</i>
<i>I wish to come true? ¶</i>

12:14.301 --> 12:16.935
<i>¶ So many he's choosing</i>
<i>It's kind of confusing ¶</i>

12:16.937 --> 12:19.304
<i>¶ It's hard to choose</i>
<i>which wish I will use ¶</i>

12:19.306 --> 12:21.639
<i>¶ So me wish be</i>
<i>to wish every wish ¶</i>

12:21.641 --> 12:26.778
<i>¶ Me wish be to wish</i>
<i>every wish ¶</i>

12:26.780 --> 12:31.583
Well now, Pirate Genie,
let us get down to business.

12:33.486 --> 12:37.255
I have a few things on me
wish list to go over with you.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.191
- Sorry, Captain Hook, but...
- But what?

12:40.193 --> 12:42.927
I can't make your
treasure-wishes come true.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.697
Can't... or won't?

12:45.699 --> 12:49.234
Can't. I'm afraid me
treasure-wishing magic is gone.

12:49.236 --> 12:54.405
- Poof!
- No wishes?!
What kind of a genie are you?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.574
Not a very good one, obviously.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.811
This is why I need to find
the Treasure-Wishing Well.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.480
It's the only way
to restore me power.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.316
Treasure-Wishing Well, eh?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.519
I like the sound of that.

13:07.521 --> 13:13.191
Lead the way, genie!
I want me wishes!

13:14.593 --> 13:19.164
Oh, Pirate Genie, are we getting
any closer to this Wishing Well?

13:19.166 --> 13:22.333
All I have is this last clue
from the Pirate Genie Code:

13:22.335 --> 13:26.638
"We need to end up nowhere,
and ancient rocks will tell

13:26.640 --> 13:30.175
the straight and twisty path
to the Treasure-Wishing Well."

13:30.177 --> 13:32.944
I know where we are.
We're nowhere!

13:32.946 --> 13:36.981
Why, that's the most
ridiculous thing I ever... Wait!

13:36.983 --> 13:39.918
That's it! We're nowhere!

13:39.920 --> 13:43.788
We're in...
the Valley of Nowhere! [echoes]

13:43.790 --> 13:46.291
[Sharky] All I sees are
is bunch of old rocks!

13:46.293 --> 13:50.461
That's them, Sharky!
Them those are the
ancient rocks!

13:50.463 --> 13:55.333
And look, they mark a path
just like the Pirate Genie said!

13:55.335 --> 13:59.871
Wonder-wish! We found the
Treasure-Wishing Well!

13:59.873 --> 14:03.675
[Well] Welcome, Pirate Genie,
this is what to do:

14:03.677 --> 14:08.847
Come closer, so my wishing magic
can wish-wash over you!

14:11.050 --> 14:14.385
[laughs] That tickles!

14:14.387 --> 14:16.988
[Well] Return to your
ship-in-the-bottle,

14:16.990 --> 14:19.357
and the next time
that you're free,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.459
your magic will return,

14:21.461 --> 14:25.930
and a powerful Pirate Genie
you again shall be!

14:25.932 --> 14:27.799
Aye, aye!

14:27.801 --> 14:29.567
Pip! We're here!

14:29.569 --> 14:31.769
[Skully] But I think
we're too late!

14:31.771 --> 14:36.574
Oh, pity!
It seems I, not you,

14:36.576 --> 14:41.613
am helping
the Pirate Genie get his
treasure-wishing power back.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.849
Yo-ho-ho and a rub-a-dub too,

14:44.851 --> 14:49.754
come out and make me
treasure-wishes come true.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.624
Yowza-wowza!

14:52.626 --> 14:55.059
My treasure-wishing
power is back!

14:55.061 --> 14:57.795
Come on, Pip!
Let's fly away from here!

14:57.797 --> 15:00.098
Sorry, Jake, but I can't.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.301
As long as Captain Hook has his
hooks on me ship-in-the-bottle,

15:03.303 --> 15:05.169
I'm stuck with him!

15:05.171 --> 15:07.705
I've gotta
grant him his wishes.

15:07.707 --> 15:12.110
Let us not dawdle
one more minute!
Men, back to the <i>Jolly Roger!</i>

15:12.112 --> 15:16.781
But cap'n, walking all the way
to the Never Sea
will take us forever!

15:16.783 --> 15:21.052
Oh! I wish we were on the
<i>Jolly Roger</i> this instant!

15:21.054 --> 15:24.289
To the sneakiest snook
in all of Never Land,

15:24.291 --> 15:26.891
- your treasure-wish
is my command.
- What?!

15:26.893 --> 15:29.494
No! Wait!

15:31.697 --> 15:35.099
- That wasn't my wish!
- I'm sorry, cap'n.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.136
But the rules are one
treasure-wish per matey.

15:38.138 --> 15:42.173
- It's someone else's turn now.
- Ooh, goody!

15:42.175 --> 15:45.043
- I treasure-wish for a...
- Bones!

15:45.045 --> 15:47.812
You are going
to wish for me!

15:47.814 --> 15:51.015
- Treasure-wish away!
- Pirate Genie-guy,

15:51.017 --> 15:55.687
I treasure-wish that the <i>Jolly</i>
<i>Roger</i> be filled with treasure!

15:55.689 --> 15:58.690
- Lots and lots of it!
- Get ready!

15:58.692 --> 16:01.926
To the fellow most mellow
in all of Never Land,

16:01.928 --> 16:05.630
your treasure-wish
is my command!

16:07.866 --> 16:10.635
Scuffle me boots! Treasure!

16:10.637 --> 16:13.905
And more treasure!

16:13.907 --> 16:16.741
And it's all mine!

16:16.743 --> 16:20.044
- [water bubbling]
- Oh, my! Oh, my!

16:20.046 --> 16:24.048
We're sinking!
Abandon ship!

16:33.258 --> 16:38.229
This is all your fault, you
wishy-washy wish-mongerer!

16:38.231 --> 16:40.531
All I did was follow
your wish, master.

16:40.533 --> 16:44.736
- You wanted treasure...
- But I lost it all! Oof!

16:44.738 --> 16:48.373
Cheer up, cap'n. Me and Sharky
still have our wishes.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.275
- Maybe we can help.
- Of course you can!

16:51.277 --> 16:53.878
Smee, go for it!

16:53.880 --> 16:57.015
- Treasure-wish away!
- [clears throat]

16:57.017 --> 17:01.219
"I treasure-wish for a chest of
gold in a place well-protected

17:01.221 --> 17:05.189
from any thieving pirates,
puny or otherwise."

17:05.191 --> 17:08.059
To the finest
first mate in Never Land,

17:08.061 --> 17:11.329
your treasure-wish
is my command!

17:15.034 --> 17:17.135
What have you done?!

17:17.137 --> 17:19.937
I gave you exactly
what you wanted:

17:19.939 --> 17:22.673
A chest of gold in a
place well-protected.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.143
And what better place
than Crocodile Creek!

17:25.145 --> 17:30.014
- [all shouting]
- [slurps, growls]

17:30.016 --> 17:33.317
Sharky, treasure-wish away!

17:33.319 --> 17:37.188
Ooh, this is a biggun'!
I treasure-wish for...

17:37.190 --> 17:39.724
...a mountain of gold!

17:39.726 --> 17:42.593
- To one of the most...
- And this time,

17:42.595 --> 17:47.365
- no Pirate Genie tricks!
- Why, of course not, master.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.435
To one of the most
musical mates in Never Land,

17:50.437 --> 17:53.371
your treasure-wish
is my command!

17:56.408 --> 18:01.446
Finally! A mountain of gold,
all for me!

18:01.448 --> 18:03.448
Now let us get digging!

18:03.450 --> 18:06.784
That mountain of gold
has to be a Captain Hook wish.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.357
- [rumbling]
- What in plunder?

18:13.359 --> 18:15.626
[all] Avalanche!

18:15.628 --> 18:19.931
Blasted Pirate Genie!
This is all his fault!

18:19.933 --> 18:22.900
But it was your
treasure-wish, sir!

18:22.902 --> 18:25.403
And you did get
what you wanted!

18:25.405 --> 18:29.974
- [Mr. Smee moans]
- [Sharky, Bones]
This is an emergency!

18:29.976 --> 18:34.278
- [all shouting]
- Captain Hook, here's
a little Pixie Dust for you!

18:34.280 --> 18:37.715
Pixie Dust away!

18:37.717 --> 18:40.551
- Oh, dear!
- [Captain Hook shouts]

18:40.553 --> 18:44.288
All right! We saved
Captain Hook and his crew,

18:44.290 --> 18:47.024
and we got six more
gold doubloons!

18:47.026 --> 18:48.793
Let's grab 'em and go!

18:49.561 --> 18:50.795
For the record,

18:50.797 --> 18:53.297
I did not ask for your help!

18:53.299 --> 18:56.701
But, speaking on behalf
of the captain and crew,

18:56.703 --> 18:59.637
thank you ever so much!

18:59.639 --> 19:04.842
Blast! This is not
what I wished for!

19:04.844 --> 19:07.712
No! I cannot abandon me ship!

19:11.683 --> 19:14.485
Oh, no! My ship!

19:16.455 --> 19:19.223
Me gold! No!

19:19.225 --> 19:21.659
Where is that
Pirate Genie pest?

19:21.661 --> 19:25.897
- I am not through with him!
- I'm afraid it's too late, sir.

19:25.899 --> 19:30.735
We've already used up
all of our... I mean,
your treasure-wishes.

19:30.737 --> 19:34.238
[sighs] Then our
work here is done.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.208
To the <i>Jolly Roger,</i> men.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.478
[Pip] Alas, me ship,
it's a shipwreck!

19:40.480 --> 19:44.015
It may not have been much, but
it was the only ship I ever had.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.817
Well, we still have your bottle.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.188
That's great news, Jake! Now
that it's back in your hands,

19:50.190 --> 19:52.723
at least I can make your
treasure-wishes come true.

19:52.725 --> 19:58.062
Then yo-ho, let's get
back to Pirate Island
and start treasure-wishin'!

19:59.665 --> 20:01.332
Ready with your
wishes, mateys?

20:01.334 --> 20:04.402
Well, I was going to wish
for a hang-glider...

20:04.404 --> 20:07.471
I was thinking
about a music box...

20:07.473 --> 20:10.374
I was going
for a box of crackers...

20:10.376 --> 20:14.378
- Hey, I've got an idea!
- [whispering]

20:14.380 --> 20:16.514
So, what be your treasure-wish?

20:16.516 --> 20:21.252
Well, a Pirate Genie friend
of ours once told us

20:21.254 --> 20:24.322
what he'd wish for
if he could make a wish.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.959
But since genies can't make
their own wishes come true...

20:27.961 --> 20:32.730
What if we put all of our
treasure-wishes together
and made a wish for you?

20:32.732 --> 20:36.968
Why, no crew has ever given up
all their wishes before.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.503
But, hey, it's worth a try.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.572
Treasure-wish away!

20:41.574 --> 20:46.210
We wish for a big pirate ship
for Pip the Pirate Genie

20:46.212 --> 20:48.980
so that he can sail
the Never Sea.

20:48.982 --> 20:53.184
You got it, buckos! To the best
pirate crew in Never Land,

20:53.186 --> 20:56.887
your treasure-wish
is my command!

21:02.527 --> 21:07.131
Wish-tastic!
Thanks to all of you,
my treasure-wish has come true!

21:09.067 --> 21:12.036
<i>¶ I never met mateys</i>
<i>on the Never Sea ¶</i>

21:12.038 --> 21:14.171
¶ Or anywhere else, you know

21:14.173 --> 21:17.975

21:36.529 --> 21:38.596
See ya sometime soon, mates!

21:38.598 --> 21:40.131
- So long, Pip!
- Goodbye!

21:40.133 --> 21:41.866
- Anchors away!
- Happy wishes!

21:41.868 --> 21:45.136
Thanks for helping Pip the
Pirate Genie today, mateys.

21:45.138 --> 21:49.307
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons into our
Team Treasure Chest.

21:56.581 --> 21:58.883
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:58.885 --> 22:00.951
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>

Come on! Count with us!

22:08.227 --> 22:10.728
[all] Yeah!

22:10.730 --> 22:14.598
[Jake] One, two, three...

22:14.600 --> 22:17.234
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

22:17.236 --> 22:22.406
[Izzy] Seven, eight,
nine, ten, 11, 12!

22:22.408 --> 22:25.543
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

22:25.545 --> 22:28.813
we got 12 gold doubloons!

22:28.815 --> 22:33.784
And we got to make a Pirate
Genie's wish come true!

22:34.786 --> 22:38.389
Once again, I am treasure-less.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.925
And don't forget
treasure-wish-less.

22:42.728 --> 22:45.863
[Pip laughs] Fair wishes to ya!

22:45.865 --> 22:51.635
Blast! I wish I was
far, far away from that
pathetic Pirate Genie!

22:51.637 --> 22:53.070
- [groans]
- [thudding]

22:53.072 --> 22:55.306
[gasps]

22:55.308 --> 22:58.309
[Captain Hook screaming]

22:58.311 --> 23:00.544
- Well, what do you know?
- [crashing]

23:00.546 --> 23:05.983
- The captain's wish came true!
- And so did ours! [laughs]

23:05.985 --> 23:10.621
<i>¶ When I'm on the deck and</i>

23:10.623 --> 23:14.792
