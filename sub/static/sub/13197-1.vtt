00:31.564 --> 00:33.857
<i>It was a day like no other.</i>

00:37.528 --> 00:40.239
<i>It was a day I had always dreamed of.</i>

00:41.156 --> 00:43.324
<i>A day I would never forget.</i>

00:45.535 --> 00:49.497
Will you marry this woman
and take her to your heart,

00:49.581 --> 00:52.417
forever devoted and forever young?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.168
I will.

00:54.252 --> 00:58.840
And will you marry this man
and take him to your heart,

00:58.923 --> 01:01.426
forever devoted and forever young?

01:01.509 --> 01:03.469
I will.

01:03.553 --> 01:06.680
Would you now place the ring on her finger?

01:09.892 --> 01:11.560
I now declare...

01:14.938 --> 01:17.858
<i>What a shame we had uninvited guests.</i>

01:20.736 --> 01:23.822
I'll have what I came for this day!

01:26.325 --> 01:28.202
<i>Jack politely asked him to leave.</i>

01:28.535 --> 01:30.411
Kiss steel, bastard!

01:43.674 --> 01:45.384
Jack!

02:02.442 --> 02:04.528
Hold tight! I'm coming!

02:08.490 --> 02:11.535
<i>His temper flared,</i>
<i>but he fought like a gentleman.</i>

02:34.890 --> 02:39.395
<i>My one true love had fought bravely,</i>
<i>but it wasn't enough.</i>

02:51.281 --> 02:53.366
<i>There was only room for one more.</i>

02:53.449 --> 02:56.035
<i>It was either my love or myself.</i>

02:56.119 --> 03:00.498
- You take it, my love.
- Never! Those maggots will not have you.

03:00.665 --> 03:03.293
They will not have me for long.

03:03.376 --> 03:06.670
I have consumption
and will be dead before the year is out.

03:06.753 --> 03:10.883
You were gonna marry me
with consumption? Why didn't you tell me?

03:10.966 --> 03:13.135
I didn't want to spoil things.

03:13.218 --> 03:14.511
- Go.
- No!

03:14.595 --> 03:16.889
Live to fight another day.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.853
Whatever makes you happy.

03:28.524 --> 03:31.861
<i>With Jack, my happiness always came first.</i>

03:33.654 --> 03:35.531
<i>I faced my fate alone.</i>

03:35.698 --> 03:38.743
<i>The 10 turned to 20, the 20 to 40.</i>

03:38.826 --> 03:42.038
<i>Could this be the end of</i>
<i>my freedom, my salvation, my...</i>

03:42.121 --> 03:44.832
Hey, gorgeous!

03:45.625 --> 03:47.919
Hiya, Joanie!

04:01.640 --> 04:03.725
What happened?

04:35.047 --> 04:39.008
"Was this the end of my freedom,
my salvation?"

04:41.469 --> 04:43.555
My career?

05:56.499 --> 05:58.752
Gorgeous day. Huh, gorgeous?

05:58.835 --> 06:01.254
We got blue skies,

06:01.338 --> 06:04.674
nice warm water and a cold beer.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.679
Honey, did you get any more Buds?

06:09.763 --> 06:14.725
No, I just didn't have time today
to ravage the Riviera for your beer.

06:15.684 --> 06:19.021
- Tough day, huh?
- Yeah, you could say it was tough.

06:19.104 --> 06:22.733
But then when the going gets tough,
the tough...

06:25.277 --> 06:27.154
I don't know what the tough do.

06:27.238 --> 06:30.324
I don't know what the pirates do,
or what anybody does.

06:30.407 --> 06:33.911
- Jack...
- Oh, honey. I know, baby. I know.

06:37.038 --> 06:39.958
Look out there. What do you see?

06:40.917 --> 06:42.919
- Bloomingdale's?
- No.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.462
Greece.

06:44.546 --> 06:48.216
Yeah. Mykonos, Lesbos, ouzo, olive oil.
Honey, we're going.

06:48.299 --> 06:52.387
Wait. I thought you said that
we were going back to New York for a while.

06:52.470 --> 06:55.431
Absolutely.
When the summer's over we're going.

06:55.515 --> 06:59.810
Oh, Jack, we've been on this boat
half a year now. I need shore leave.

06:59.893 --> 07:03.480
I promised Gloria I'd finish that book
three months ago, and I can't.

07:03.564 --> 07:05.649
I don't know what happens next.

07:05.732 --> 07:08.527
I thought you wanted
to sail around the world with me.

07:08.610 --> 07:11.822
Well, I do, but not all of it this week.

07:12.239 --> 07:15.033
I mean, Jack, this is just becoming a blur.

07:15.117 --> 07:19.872
Exotic ports and great parties
and spectacular sunsets...

07:19.955 --> 07:21.622
It's not enough.

07:21.706 --> 07:23.958
It's not enough?!

07:24.041 --> 07:28.379
You sound like someone who's got what they
wanted and now don't want what they got.

07:28.462 --> 07:31.966
- I wanna do something serious.
- Serious? Come on!

07:32.049 --> 07:34.468
How much romance can one woman take?

07:34.552 --> 07:36.846
Joan Wilder?

07:39.473 --> 07:41.976
From your most devoted friend.

07:42.685 --> 07:44.769
Thank you.

07:51.067 --> 07:55.322
"This afternoon we shall meet... awaiting
the moment." What's this afternoon?

07:55.405 --> 08:00.243
- Must be somebody coming to the reception.
- That's not till next Tuesday.

08:01.828 --> 08:04.331
This is "next Tuesday", Jack.

08:20.554 --> 08:25.601
- Jack, you said you were getting a car.
- If I knew it was Tuesday, I would've. Sorry.

08:25.684 --> 08:27.770
That's all right.

08:27.853 --> 08:31.190
Whaddaya say we spin that roulette wheel
while we're there?

08:31.272 --> 08:33.357
Sounds great.

08:43.076 --> 08:44.369
Jack.

08:44.452 --> 08:46.329
- Yeah?
- She can't leave now.

08:46.412 --> 08:49.207
- Why not?
- What do you mean, "Why not?"

08:49.290 --> 08:52.794
- Oh, my God.
- I'm your biggest fan!

08:52.877 --> 08:55.212
- I read all your books.
- Thank you.

08:55.295 --> 08:59.550
I'm so happy to see you.

08:59.633 --> 09:02.886
- This is my publisher. Gloria Horne.
- Oh, your publisher.

09:03.470 --> 09:06.390
- And this is...
- You are Mr Wilder?

09:06.974 --> 09:09.810
No, I'm Mr Colton. Jack Colton.

09:09.893 --> 09:12.229
What do you do, Mr Colton?

09:12.312 --> 09:14.398
Casino work.

09:14.481 --> 09:19.068
Yeah. I think I'll go downstairs and punch in.
Excuse me, excuse me.

09:19.151 --> 09:21.654
- But...
- I'll be back!

09:23.155 --> 09:25.408
God, I've got to have a drink!

09:25.491 --> 09:27.952
Literary functions are not Jack's speed.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.956
I mean, his favourite author
is the man who wrote "Pull Tab to Open".

09:32.039 --> 09:35.960
- I am his favourite author.
- You saying it's none of my business?

09:36.043 --> 09:39.088
Let me tell you, Jack is not the marrying kind.

09:39.172 --> 09:43.216
I am worried. You're the girl who
never gets a book back late to the library.

09:43.300 --> 09:48.471
You are three months past your deadline.
What gives? <i>Un scotch, double.</i>

09:48.555 --> 09:53.476
My heart just isn't in it. Romance
just doesn't seem real to me any more.

09:53.560 --> 09:58.106
Real? You don't write "real". You write
about people that sail off into the sunset.

09:58.190 --> 10:02.903
- And the next day when the sun comes up?
- There is no next day in romance.

10:02.986 --> 10:06.322
Stop confusing real life
with a romantic novel.

10:06.697 --> 10:10.284
- Joanie, just finish it.
- I can't.

10:10.367 --> 10:13.412
After 17 books,
I don't know how it ends any more.

10:13.495 --> 10:16.540
Then permit me to tell you.

10:19.835 --> 10:21.921
It doesn't end.

10:22.004 --> 10:25.841
It only begins anew
when you journey down the Nile with me.

10:27.343 --> 10:30.053
- Have you got the right woman?
- No.

10:31.262 --> 10:36.392
My name is Omar Khalifa and I have travelled
1,000 miles to tell you I need you.

10:36.476 --> 10:39.312
- You sent me the flowers.
- They pale by your beauty.

10:39.395 --> 10:41.064
Oh, Mary!

10:41.147 --> 10:45.360
- I read about you.
- Yes, I know. <i>Time</i> magazine.

10:45.443 --> 10:50.031
Well, I'm afraid the Western press
cannot understand the spirit of my vision.

10:50.114 --> 10:53.033
You are a writer. You can understand.

10:53.909 --> 10:57.538
So, Joan Wilder,
you must come and write my story.

10:58.705 --> 11:01.041
I only write romance novels.

11:01.124 --> 11:05.128
Yes. And you haven't finished the one
you're working on right now.

11:05.963 --> 11:10.300
You are a gifted storyteller.
You create heroes in a world of cynics.

11:10.551 --> 11:14.429
Journey down the Nile with me
and I'll give you a chance to record history.

11:14.513 --> 11:17.056
- Come. We must leave today.
- Joanie!

11:17.640 --> 11:22.728
In just four nights I will become Emperor,
and you will have the exclusive story.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.648
- They have emperors on the Nile?
- They do now.

11:26.524 --> 11:28.609
Oh, shit.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.505
So now what are we celebrating?

11:50.589 --> 11:53.091
- The Nile!
- Oh, the Nile.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.177
We've been invited to Africa.

11:56.052 --> 11:58.180
Jack Colton, Omar Khalifa.

11:58.930 --> 12:01.224
How do you do?

12:01.308 --> 12:07.479
He's asked me - me - to write his story.
It's just what I've always wanted to do!

12:07.563 --> 12:11.901
And now Joan's work will receive
the serious attention that it deserves.

12:11.984 --> 12:15.029
And this will be her biggest accomplishment:

12:15.112 --> 12:17.198
My biography.

12:17.865 --> 12:21.368
What's so important there
that you have to write the book now?

12:21.452 --> 12:23.954
- Mr Khalifa has...
- Omar, please.

12:24.538 --> 12:28.791
Omar has been chosen
to unite the tribes of the Nile

12:29.042 --> 12:31.961
and end the strife that has bloodied his land.

12:32.045 --> 12:35.215
He will carry on the work of
the missing Great Redeemer.

12:35.298 --> 12:39.177
- You have listened very well.
- You got all that in 20 minutes?

12:41.095 --> 12:45.099
As a friend of Miss Wilder's,
you are welcome to be my guest also.

12:45.642 --> 12:47.727
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.523
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?

12:58.237 --> 13:00.322
I thought you wanted to go to New York.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.699
- That's all changed.
- That fast?

13:02.783 --> 13:07.079
But to write a biography -
it's something important, something real.

13:07.162 --> 13:11.333
- This is what I've been looking for.
- Isn't it a little bit over your head?

13:11.416 --> 13:13.918
I think it's a great chance.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.087
So you got your heart set on it?

13:20.967 --> 13:23.427
Mine's set on Greece.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.017
So when are you gonna leave?

13:31.185 --> 13:33.938
Tonight. He has a private jet and...

13:34.021 --> 13:36.314
Oh, he's got a private jet.

13:38.441 --> 13:41.945
- Oh, what the hell. We had a good run.
- Oh, Jack, come on.

13:42.028 --> 13:44.823
This is just five or four weeks of research.

13:44.906 --> 13:47.701
Maybe you're right. Maybe we need a break.

13:47.784 --> 13:50.203
It's been kind of tough lately.

13:50.287 --> 13:53.832
Yeah. When the going gets tough,
the tough go to Greece.

13:57.836 --> 14:01.088
- Well, I'll write you.
- Where?

14:02.840 --> 14:04.633
Yeah.

14:04.717 --> 14:06.594
Where?

14:19.398 --> 14:23.359
I think I'll go down and
give that roulette wheel one more chance.

14:33.369 --> 14:35.455
You take care of yourself.

14:37.957 --> 14:40.043
And you stay out of trouble.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.679
Look out for her, will ya?

14:52.763 --> 14:56.975
I can offer you this comfort:
She leaves you for a higher purpose.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.147
Yeah.

15:17.411 --> 15:19.497
Free <i>Al-Jawhara!</i>

15:49.150 --> 15:53.446
Don't be frightened. You know,
a man of vision has many enemies.

15:53.530 --> 15:57.491
And my destiny is to outsmart them.
You see?

15:58.450 --> 16:00.536
Like it?

16:00.995 --> 16:03.330
It's OK.

16:45.662 --> 16:48.874
Well, sweetheart, I guess it's just you and me.

16:48.957 --> 16:51.752
Goddamn it, she was the best time I ever had.

16:52.127 --> 16:54.963
Don't cry, scumbag! I'll keep you company.

16:58.509 --> 17:01.845
Cartagena, Colombia!
Long time no... Oh, shit.

17:01.929 --> 17:05.933
- Go ahead. Gimme a reason. Make my year!
- Hey, go easy with the gun.

17:06.016 --> 17:10.685
Did you miss me? I missed you.
You're all I thought about for six months.

17:10.936 --> 17:15.733
They threw me in a jail filled with rejects
from the communicable disease ward.

17:15.983 --> 17:20.738
Every wacko, drippy,
open-sored lowlife was in that joint!

17:20.821 --> 17:23.281
All wanting to be my proctologist.

17:23.532 --> 17:26.786
And rats! I'm full of rat bites.

17:27.954 --> 17:32.958
Ten weeks of rabies shots this long and
all I thought of was you, Colton. Just you!

17:33.041 --> 17:37.629
Well, I'm flattered, pal.
And I'm sorry you had such a tough time.

17:39.005 --> 17:40.966
How about 100 bucks?

17:41.049 --> 17:44.970
I'll give you a one-way ticket to Harp Land!
What'd you do with it?

17:45.053 --> 17:48.348
- What are you talking about?
- The stone, moron! I'm cocked!

17:48.431 --> 17:53.227
- Let's talk about this like gentlemen.
- Gentlemen! Did I tell you I got malaria?

17:53.310 --> 17:57.773
Every time I shake, I shake like this. Know
what happens if I shake my trigger finger?

17:57.857 --> 18:01.902
And I feel an attack coming on!
Know what happens if that happens?

18:01.986 --> 18:04.822
It's the end of Mr Lucky. That's the end of...

18:05.406 --> 18:07.658
Holy shit!

18:08.659 --> 18:11.996
Quiet! Next time you'll not be so lucky.

18:12.079 --> 18:16.041
- I am Tarak. You must come with me now.
- What the hell are you?

18:16.125 --> 18:19.919
- Omar steal our jewel. <i>Al-Jawhara.</i>
- Jewel?

18:20.003 --> 18:24.549
You were invited with the woman. You can
get into Omar's palace. My people cannot.

18:24.632 --> 18:29.429
- What people? What are you talking about?
- You must help me find the Jewel.

18:29.512 --> 18:31.890
- What jewel?
- The Jewel of the Nile.

18:31.973 --> 18:34.475
- Our most priceless jewel.
- Oh, that jewel.

18:34.559 --> 18:38.313
Omar has stolen my people's jewel.
Omar is a very bad man.

18:38.396 --> 18:40.481
Oh, that scum! I spit on him!

18:40.564 --> 18:44.193
Jack, buddy, let's help this nice man
get his jewel back.

18:44.276 --> 18:47.863
- Yes.
- Look, I don't know where you're from,

18:47.946 --> 18:50.032
but I'm sailing my boat tonight.

18:50.115 --> 18:54.578
No, you must come to help find the Jewel
now before Omar kill many people.

18:54.870 --> 18:58.665
As long as Omar have the Jewel,
nothing can stop him.

18:58.749 --> 19:02.794
Look, I'm going on the boat.
You guys can do what you want.

19:08.341 --> 19:10.218
The boat blew up!

19:12.595 --> 19:14.472
My boat blew up.

19:14.555 --> 19:16.599
The boat blew up!

19:16.682 --> 19:18.768
Everything's gone.

19:20.978 --> 19:24.482
Who are you? The Prince of Darkness?
Don't you got any friends?

19:24.649 --> 19:26.733
This is the work of Omar.

19:28.151 --> 19:32.030
- Omar blew up my boat, huh?
- Your woman is in danger, too.

19:32.113 --> 19:34.115
I will take you to him.

19:34.199 --> 19:36.701
- I'm coming, too.
- The hell you are!

19:37.285 --> 19:40.288
Look, you owe me, Colton.

19:40.372 --> 19:43.083
So wherever you're going, I'm going.

19:44.376 --> 19:46.670
Where we going?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.296
Africa.

20:18.867 --> 20:22.120
- Do you recognise my home?
- I wrote this!

20:22.203 --> 20:27.458
Yes! In <i>The Return of the King.</i>
I had the same uniforms designed.

20:40.053 --> 20:42.347
Hello. Hi!

20:45.434 --> 20:48.812
- Is all this yours?
- It belongs to the country. To my people.

20:48.896 --> 20:50.772
Oh.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.946
Why point out the negative?

20:58.030 --> 21:01.073
In three nights in Kadir
the moon will be full,

21:01.157 --> 21:06.662
and all my people will unite behind me
in peace and none of this will be necessary.

21:06.746 --> 21:11.209
- Now let me show you my humble house.
- Thank you.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.800
I'm really blessed. My people love me.

21:19.884 --> 21:23.553
Well, yes. They seem very... enthusiastic.

21:30.185 --> 21:34.773
Oh, this is a good shot for you -
the little boy holding up my picture.

21:34.856 --> 21:36.942
Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.

21:59.046 --> 22:00.714
My humble house.

22:00.798 --> 22:03.425
You must forgive us. We are a poor people.

22:13.351 --> 22:15.979
Everything you need, they will bring you.

22:16.062 --> 22:17.522
Oh, thank you.

22:17.605 --> 22:21.609
Here only strangers say thank you.
Family and friends have no need.

22:23.570 --> 22:25.572
What was that?

22:25.655 --> 22:27.740
Cats. Come.

22:30.076 --> 22:31.744
I have a cat.

22:39.334 --> 22:41.420
I hope this is satisfactory.

22:42.963 --> 22:46.258
Oh, yes, this is OK. Fine.

22:46.341 --> 22:48.886
Here you'll write your masterpiece.

22:48.969 --> 22:51.180
Ah, I have a few questions...

22:51.263 --> 22:54.766
I see the writer is already at work. Good.

22:55.851 --> 22:58.269
Explore your new world.

22:58.352 --> 23:01.772
Feel free to go anywhere and see anything.

23:02.106 --> 23:04.192
Talk to anyone.

23:04.775 --> 23:08.529
I'm glad you're here, Joan.
Together we'll make history.

24:06.043 --> 24:08.128
It's like a fishbowl!

24:08.211 --> 24:12.799
Why do these Third World cesspools
always gotta be so hot, will you tell me that?

24:15.051 --> 24:17.137
Hey, where the hell you going?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.686
Holy shit!

24:41.785 --> 24:46.373
Well, Colton, looks like
we've hitched our wagon to a star.

25:15.318 --> 25:17.403
Stop that! Stop it!

25:26.077 --> 25:28.163
Excuse me?

25:29.247 --> 25:31.708
What does this mean?

25:35.796 --> 25:39.049
- Do you speak English?
- "Give back the Jewel."

25:39.633 --> 25:43.135
- Give back the jewel?
- Yeah. <i>Eid lana Al-Jawhara.</i>

25:48.015 --> 25:50.518
You can't do that! I'm a professional.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.445
We'll see about that.

26:03.364 --> 26:06.741
<i>If you don't tell me</i>
<i>what the hell is going on here,</i>

26:06.825 --> 26:11.037
- I'll be on the first plane back to New York.
- It's impossible.

26:11.621 --> 26:16.709
Tomorrow we journey to Kadir. You must be
there. It will be your most important chapter.

26:16.793 --> 26:20.839
- I can't write if you keep secrets from me.
- What secrets?

26:23.675 --> 26:25.760
What is the Jewel?

26:28.053 --> 26:30.389
The Jewel is a legend.

26:30.472 --> 26:32.558
I am real.

26:33.142 --> 26:36.562
Do not be distracted
from your mission, Joan Wilder.

26:37.271 --> 26:39.356
Make yourself comfortable.

26:39.898 --> 26:42.860
You stay with me until our book is done.

26:42.943 --> 26:45.028
You can't keep me here!

26:47.781 --> 26:49.867
Go. You are free to leave.

26:53.077 --> 26:57.206
Only the worst kind of fool
would attempt our desert alone.

27:07.550 --> 27:11.804
I gotta get off this camel.
It's breaking my ass! Colton!

27:11.888 --> 27:14.473
- You gotta hang on and take it.
- I can't.

27:14.556 --> 27:18.018
- The camp's coming up.
- Shit!

27:33.325 --> 27:35.410
You are welcome!

27:37.037 --> 27:39.663
We have food! We have drink!

27:39.747 --> 27:41.832
You got a toilet?

27:46.712 --> 27:49.006
So how big is this jewel?

27:54.720 --> 27:57.807
Very, very big. Very big. Very, very big.

27:57.890 --> 27:59.058
Very big.

28:00.226 --> 28:02.936
It's as big as this orange?

28:10.693 --> 28:14.572
- It's as big as an orange.
- The Jewel is the heart of our people.

28:14.739 --> 28:17.158
Omar steals the heart of our people.

28:17.242 --> 28:19.536
- Omar is thief.
- Omar is very bad man.

28:19.869 --> 28:22.872
Before Omar steal Jewel, everything good.

28:22.956 --> 28:24.873
Now everything is shit!

28:33.507 --> 28:38.262
You help us find the Jewel,
and we give you great reward.

28:38.345 --> 28:41.682
But if you lie to us, you die.

28:43.433 --> 28:45.394
But now we dance!

29:20.385 --> 29:22.471
Look at these guys, Colton.

29:22.554 --> 29:24.639
No sheep is safe tonight.

29:36.066 --> 29:39.904
We split it right down the middle,
Colton. 50-50.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.072
What are you talking about?

29:42.156 --> 29:44.700
Don't play stupid with me, partner.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.660
The Jewel.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.538
And don't you even think of
messing with me.

29:55.211 --> 29:59.130
Oh, what's that I hear?
A heart breaking? You sap!

29:59.214 --> 30:01.090
Keep your mind on business.

30:01.174 --> 30:05.762
You'll wind up getting yourself killed
over some broad who dumped you.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.307
Jewels!

30:09.390 --> 30:11.726
Oh, Omar!

30:40.420 --> 30:42.965
I want you lot to be careful!

30:43.715 --> 30:48.845
See that word "Fragile" on the side?
It means don't drop... Why don't you listen?

30:48.928 --> 30:53.683
I might love your country, your culture,
and even your people! That means I love you!

30:53.766 --> 30:57.562
But you drop one more of my boxes,
and I'll smash your bloody face in!

30:59.981 --> 31:05.027
You tell Omar, right - Omar -
that his special-effects wizard has arrived!

31:05.111 --> 31:07.196
Come on, then.

32:33.445 --> 32:36.323
War plans? Oh, my God! What is he up to?

32:41.870 --> 32:44.622
Wait till <i>Time</i> magazine sees this.

33:09.104 --> 33:11.606
You bastard! You burnt my hand!

33:11.690 --> 33:16.653
I didn't say it wouldn't burn.
I said it wouldn't hurt! There's no blistering.

33:16.736 --> 33:21.241
- I've done it hundreds of times on stage.
- This is not a cheap theatrical stunt!

33:21.324 --> 33:26.621
- It's a miracle! My people have to believe it!
- Omar, trust me. Trust what I've got to say.

33:26.705 --> 33:31.667
Look, if I can make gods out of rock'n'roll
stars, imagine what I can do for you.

33:31.750 --> 33:35.713
For your information,
I am not a rock'n'roll star!

33:35.796 --> 33:39.091
The people must believe
I have the same powers as the Jewel.

33:39.175 --> 33:41.510
Come! I want to see him now.

33:41.594 --> 33:45.806
If it weren't for the Jewel,
I'd have led my people to power long ago.

33:55.190 --> 34:00.236
Westerners understand nothing. The Jewel
represents the spiritual world of my people.

34:00.320 --> 34:04.908
Unless I convince them I am their spiritual
leader, they will never follow me into battle.

34:04.991 --> 34:07.076
That is why you are here.

34:32.016 --> 34:36.146
- Tell me how it's done, magician.
- It's not magic trick. It's miracle.

34:37.438 --> 34:39.815
I am losing patience with you.

34:39.899 --> 34:43.860
But you cannot kill me.
Even you are superstitious.

34:43.945 --> 34:46.614
<i>Al-Jawhara</i> lives.

34:46.697 --> 34:49.784
Two nights from now it will not matter.

35:05.382 --> 35:07.384
Oh, no.

35:11.721 --> 35:13.723
A woman?

35:13.974 --> 35:17.018
- Most unexpected.
- I gotta get outta here.

35:17.102 --> 35:19.187
I gotta stop Omar.

35:19.438 --> 35:22.232
Did you bring an army?

35:22.315 --> 35:26.527
- No. I'm just Joan Wilder.
- Just-Joan Wilder, I'm <i>Al-Jawhara.</i>

35:29.321 --> 35:31.782
The Jewel of the Nile.

35:32.116 --> 35:34.452
I don't understand.

35:34.535 --> 35:37.913
- You are the Jewel?!
- Yes. For the moment.

35:37.997 --> 35:42.918
In two nights at the holy city of Kadir
Omar will proclaim himself Emperor.

35:43.002 --> 35:47.047
Without me to oppose him, he'll march
across North Africa like a madman.

35:48.674 --> 35:51.509
But the world will see me
as the saviour of my people.

35:51.593 --> 35:56.473
No, it won't. The world won't believe you.
I've been in your office and seen your vision.

35:56.556 --> 35:58.933
- I'll write the truth about you.
- The truth?

35:59.267 --> 36:02.312
If I wanted the truth,
I would have hired <i>60 Minutes.</i>

36:02.395 --> 36:05.440
What do you know about truth?
You fantasise everything.

36:05.523 --> 36:10.945
Why do you think I brought you here? You
stay here and write what <i>I</i> tell you to write!

36:12.572 --> 36:16.742
- You think no one knows I'm here?
- Oh, yes, Jack! I forgot to tell you.

36:17.034 --> 36:19.536
Jack is dead.

36:20.496 --> 36:24.333
Don't be ridiculous.
Jack would never die without telling me.

36:24.666 --> 36:26.752
Nevertheless, he is dead.

36:33.675 --> 36:38.346
You look pale, Miss Wilder.
I'll send you my personal physician.

36:44.727 --> 36:47.146
It can't be true.

36:52.610 --> 36:56.280
This Jack... He is friend for you?

36:57.782 --> 36:59.533
Yes.

36:59.616 --> 37:01.701
He is my best friend.

37:14.631 --> 37:17.134
What? I don't see shit!

37:18.301 --> 37:20.303
We must stop here.

37:20.387 --> 37:23.431
It is dangerous for Sufis to enter Omar's city.

37:24.014 --> 37:26.725
Now, wait. He's already tried to kill me once.

37:28.894 --> 37:31.188
You are guest of Omar.

37:31.772 --> 37:34.900
Find for us the Jewel. Accept your destiny.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.238
Destiny, my ass! Excuse me.

37:40.406 --> 37:43.159
When you hook up with jujubes,
see what happens.

37:43.242 --> 37:46.203
Just take your lead from me, and we'll be fine.

37:47.662 --> 37:52.125
- We gonna walk through the centre of town?
- I'm gonna put you up a camel's ass.

37:52.208 --> 37:53.877
I might like it.

37:59.507 --> 38:02.093
- What are you doing?
- In one of my books,

38:02.177 --> 38:04.262
<i>Angelina's Savage Secret,</i>

38:04.345 --> 38:09.017
she used her nailfile to cut
the mortar away from the window box.

38:09.559 --> 38:11.685
How long did this take?

38:11.769 --> 38:13.729
Two pages.

38:13.812 --> 38:18.442
But... it's not the bars
that make the prison. It is the desert.

38:18.525 --> 38:22.362
So I'll travel at night. I don't care.
I have to stop Omar.

38:22.446 --> 38:25.199
I gotta get out to write the truth about him.

38:25.282 --> 38:27.367
I have to get to Kadir.

38:27.910 --> 38:31.371
Wait a minute.
You are the one that has to get to Kadir.

38:31.455 --> 38:34.791
You are the only one that can stop Omar.
You have to go with me!

38:37.543 --> 38:39.837
Maybe you are the one.

38:41.923 --> 38:43.382
I accept.

38:43.758 --> 38:45.843
We are sworn, Just-Joan.

38:47.887 --> 38:51.182
- Right. But it's just Joan.
- Right. Just-Joan.

38:51.265 --> 38:54.936
- Right. We just have to get out this window.
- Please.

39:00.190 --> 39:03.110
- Magic!
- Dry rot.

39:05.153 --> 39:11.201
I bet you could pick up a swell three-bedroom
town house here for about five or six dollars.

39:14.162 --> 39:15.914
Hi. My name is Colton.

39:15.997 --> 39:19.709
I've been invited by your Omar.
I'm here to see Joan Wilder.

39:22.545 --> 39:25.047
Hey, Rachid! How are you?
Good to see you again.

39:25.131 --> 39:27.341
Joan Wilder does not want to see you.

39:31.637 --> 39:34.849
Well, now, Rachid,
I don't think you understand.

39:36.434 --> 39:40.938
We're here on official business.
This is Mr... Fatush from the US Embassy.

39:41.021 --> 39:45.150
He's got something very important
to talk to all you guys about.

39:49.529 --> 39:52.866
Look, we don't want to
create an international incident here.

39:52.949 --> 39:56.077
I mean, after all, she is an American citizen.

39:56.161 --> 40:00.331
If you'll just let us see her, no paperwork.
Mum's the word. Everything...

40:02.876 --> 40:06.379
Guys, no sweat, OK?
We'll catch you next time we're in town.

40:06.463 --> 40:08.797
- Take it easy.
- Say hello to her for us.

40:08.881 --> 40:12.634
You know what they say: Once
they've had a holy man, they never go back.

40:13.218 --> 40:17.431
- Quickly, Just-Joan!
- Are you sure you know where you're going?

40:22.686 --> 40:25.731
Those guys can go for hours
without coming up for air.

40:25.814 --> 40:29.902
Ease up, will ya?
All right, there's gotta be another way in here.

40:29.985 --> 40:35.823
I can't wait for another smooth move. How
about us at the back door in pussycat suits?

40:35.907 --> 40:39.786
- When they come with the milk...
- How about you takin' it in the ear!?

40:39.869 --> 40:43.081
Look, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't be on to this.

40:43.289 --> 40:46.209
Subsequently I should shoot you
the first chance I get!

40:46.292 --> 40:47.835
Jack!

40:48.252 --> 40:50.338
You're alive!

40:50.421 --> 40:52.590
Kinda goin' outta your way to duck me!

40:52.673 --> 40:55.050
You bastard!

41:03.642 --> 41:06.520
Oh, Jack! I thought I'd never see you again.

41:06.603 --> 41:10.565
They told me you were dead.
I never wanna feel that way again.

41:11.024 --> 41:13.819
Does this mean you apologise?

41:13.902 --> 41:18.072
I feel like I'm back in eighth grade.
Is this <i>The Young and the Stupid?</i>

41:18.155 --> 41:22.535
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Don't get cagey with me. I'm on to it.

41:22.618 --> 41:24.703
I know how you two operate.

41:27.123 --> 41:30.251
I'll get in there with or without you dinks!

41:39.051 --> 41:44.139
Hey, look, guys! Lighten up!
I'm only saying hello to an old girlfriend here!

41:44.222 --> 41:47.976
- Just-Joan, we need to go!
- Wait a minute, who's this guy?

41:48.059 --> 41:51.396
- He's a friend.
- You made friends in there?

42:07.703 --> 42:10.664
- OK. Let's go, come on!
- Wait. He's coming with us.

42:11.832 --> 42:15.627
Don't start with me! I've come
halfway across Africa to rescue you.

42:15.711 --> 42:18.505
Rescue me? I was doing fine without you.

42:20.299 --> 42:23.635
- I am guide. I can help.
- I don't need a guide. I need a miracle!

42:23.719 --> 42:25.804
Jack, he's coming with us.

42:29.599 --> 42:33.895
All right. But if we get out of this alive,
I'm gonna kill you.

42:33.978 --> 42:35.438
Let's go.

43:10.222 --> 43:12.808
- Who are you?
- Is this where Al Jolson's buried?

43:12.891 --> 43:15.643
- Who the hell are you?
- Don't provoke me, pal!

43:15.726 --> 43:20.314
I had a tough day. You know
how hot it is here? It's 120 <i>º</i> in the shade.

43:22.441 --> 43:25.820
I'm like this with Weinberger.
We'll be all over you!

43:33.786 --> 43:35.663
Let me in!

43:37.747 --> 43:39.874
Holy shit and shove me in it.

44:12.239 --> 44:14.324
Oh, no. Over the wall!

44:48.190 --> 44:50.567
Excuse me. Excuse me.

44:54.446 --> 44:56.323
Come on!

44:56.406 --> 44:58.075
No! No!

45:02.746 --> 45:05.791
OK, flyboy,
your estimated time of departure is now!

45:24.517 --> 45:27.478
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything!

45:28.521 --> 45:32.108
- Well, do something!
- All right. I'm trying!

45:35.276 --> 45:37.654
I mean, this isn't Space Invaders!

45:43.743 --> 45:46.663
- Jack, the wall!
- Oh, no!

46:27.076 --> 46:31.247
- It is Space Invaders!
- That'll show 'em!

46:41.007 --> 46:42.925
All right, yeah!

46:43.676 --> 46:46.386
Oh, shit!

46:48.555 --> 46:50.640
Let's get outta here!

47:06.323 --> 47:08.407
This is gonna be tight!

47:13.329 --> 47:15.581
This is my first time in airplane.

47:28.260 --> 47:30.596
How do you stop this thing?

47:36.935 --> 47:38.812
Sorry!

47:47.070 --> 47:49.906
- Do you know where you're going?
- Give me a break!

48:34.782 --> 48:37.618
- Your friend steal the Jewel.
- What?

48:42.289 --> 48:45.375
- You! You are liar to me!
- No!

48:45.834 --> 48:48.128
I come back and you're dead!

48:53.133 --> 48:56.303
You thieving bastard!
You ain't stiffin' me again!

48:56.386 --> 48:59.765
I promise ya.
I'll feed ya to the maggots! I'll get...

49:59.363 --> 50:01.240
Great! We're out of quarters.

50:01.323 --> 50:03.450
Well, try that one there.

50:09.039 --> 50:11.125
Now what?

50:11.583 --> 50:13.669
Damn it!

50:23.428 --> 50:25.179
Yes!

50:26.013 --> 50:28.683
Hey, that's not bad for your first time.

51:03.049 --> 51:05.176
Come on, we'll get him. We'll get him.

51:05.259 --> 51:07.803
Colton, you ain't gettin' away.

51:28.740 --> 51:30.825
Where the hell's the horn?

51:32.077 --> 51:34.829
Get outta here! Get out of the way!

51:53.013 --> 51:54.473
Sandstorm.

52:04.441 --> 52:07.027
Stop!

52:07.403 --> 52:09.780
What are you gonna do?

52:11.323 --> 52:13.908
Either save us or kill us. Hang on!

53:15.134 --> 53:18.095
- Now you are dead.
- No! Don't cut off my head!

53:18.179 --> 53:22.223
- You stole our jewel.
- It was the mook! He's always screwin' me.

53:22.307 --> 53:25.268
I swear to God on my eyes
I never seen that jewel!

53:26.895 --> 53:29.522
No, wait, wait!

53:29.606 --> 53:32.150
You need me. I can help you find him.

53:32.233 --> 53:37.155
- You are his friend.
- No! No friend. Stop saying that.

53:37.238 --> 53:39.574
Friends don't stab each other in the back.

53:39.657 --> 53:44.287
Come on. Look, we'll team up.
We'll find him, we'll get him good.

53:44.370 --> 53:48.665
He knows that I will not be denied!
Colton's future is bleak!

53:49.333 --> 53:51.418
<i>Very bleak!</i>

53:54.380 --> 53:56.256
Any idea where we are?

53:56.340 --> 54:01.303
The best I can figure out is that we head
due east. We should make it to the border.

54:01.387 --> 54:06.975
- Well... is that the way to Kadir?
- <i>La.</i> Kadir is in the west, over that mountain.

54:07.101 --> 54:10.645
Well, the best of luck to you, pal.
Joan, let's get going.

54:10.728 --> 54:12.897
Jack, we have to take him to Kadir.

54:14.190 --> 54:17.652
What are you talkin' about?
We got him out, like you said. Come on.

54:17.735 --> 54:20.863
We swore an oath, Just-Joan and I.
We go to Kadir.

54:22.365 --> 54:24.867
What is it with you?!

54:24.951 --> 54:29.664
Jesus! Everything's always gotta be
your way? It's just like the goddamn boat!

54:29.747 --> 54:34.167
What do you mean "my way"? It wasn't
my idea to spend six months on your boat!

54:34.251 --> 54:38.714
- Oh, debate good. I enjoy.
- OK, let me tell you what I put up with.

54:39.089 --> 54:43.343
We're moored off the Canary Islands.
Midnight, sound asleep.

54:43.427 --> 54:46.054
Three crazed Joan Wilder fans

54:46.138 --> 54:49.599
decide they want the anchor
of the <i>Angelina</i> for a souvenir!

54:49.683 --> 54:55.105
- We were drifting for days! And the other...
- Stop. I'm sorry. It's time for Just-Joan.

54:55.188 --> 54:58.357
- Remember the Costa del Sol, Jack?
- Oh, come on!

54:58.441 --> 55:01.277
He's gotta meet me
at the governor's for dinner.

55:01.360 --> 55:06.323
And you show up with the entire
national basketball team!

55:06.407 --> 55:08.284
They were hungry.

55:08.367 --> 55:11.996
This is what I'm talking about.
Sometimes you could think about me.

55:12.079 --> 55:16.333
Oh, I suppose you were thinking all about me
when you took off with Omar?

55:16.417 --> 55:18.502
- He blew up my boat!
- Our boat?

55:18.586 --> 55:22.464
- Oh, now it's our boat?
- Good debate. It's equal, no winners.

55:22.547 --> 55:25.842
- Just-Joan, we must hurry.
- Wait. He blew up our boat?

55:25.925 --> 55:29.179
Why are you risking your life for this guy?

55:30.513 --> 55:34.350
I made a commitment. I can't break it.

55:38.229 --> 55:40.899
OK. Fine.

55:40.982 --> 55:44.777
But I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I didn't come here for you anyway. No!

55:44.860 --> 55:47.946
I'm on to something big.

55:48.572 --> 55:53.577
- A jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.
- Come with us. I am <i>Jawhara!</i>

55:54.578 --> 55:57.873
- That means Joe.
- Thanks, Joe, but no thanks.

55:58.332 --> 56:01.335
I wouldn't want her
to break her commitment.

56:02.044 --> 56:04.129
Oh, Jack...

56:04.546 --> 56:06.631
Come on.

56:44.918 --> 56:47.003
That's for the <i>Angelina.</i>

56:48.130 --> 56:50.215
I still owe you for Joan.

56:53.801 --> 56:58.472
Oh, no. Oh, God.
Please, let me get out of this alive.

56:58.597 --> 57:02.601
I swear to God
I'll be a good boy from tomorrow on.

57:08.107 --> 57:10.192
But tonight I gotta kill Colton.

57:23.997 --> 57:26.416
<i>Heydi Joan Wilder!</i>

57:40.512 --> 57:44.266
- Why you didn't tell your friend about me?
- Oh, I know him.

57:44.850 --> 57:49.313
He'd go halfway round the world for a party.
He wouldn't cross town for a noble cause.

57:49.396 --> 57:53.358
- People can surprise you.
- No, he's just Jack. He'll never change.

57:53.442 --> 57:55.527
Like a...

57:56.111 --> 57:58.238
Like a stone.

57:58.322 --> 58:02.076
It's always a stone. Open your hand.

58:03.326 --> 58:06.579
Change is not always visible.

58:06.746 --> 58:09.916
- Let's show some hustle!
- What?

58:09.999 --> 58:13.961
Your buddy Omar!
What is it? He can't live without you?

58:17.799 --> 58:20.635
- Are we jogging?
- We are jogging.

58:33.397 --> 58:35.899
Greece is looking better and better.

58:44.950 --> 58:47.035
Oh, shit!

58:48.495 --> 58:51.414
Just tell me why this guy wants you so bad.

58:52.331 --> 58:54.792
- Hey, Joe, where you going?
- This way.

58:54.875 --> 58:58.212
- You gotta be kidding.
- He knows the mountains better than you.

58:58.295 --> 59:00.381
Joan, will you give me a break?

59:00.464 --> 59:02.883
America - democracy. We vote, huh?

59:57.394 --> 59:59.480
Stop!

01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:13.576
Hurry up. Let's go!

01:00:14.494 --> 01:00:15.745
Get down!

01:00:19.999 --> 01:00:22.085
It's a black day for democracy.

01:00:23.502 --> 01:00:27.547
- Do not worry. It's not my destiny to die here.
- What about us?

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:31.343
That's another ball game.

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:42.521
Rachid!

01:00:46.525 --> 01:00:48.734
Joan Wilder!

01:00:48.818 --> 01:00:51.195
I wish no harm to you!

01:00:51.612 --> 01:00:54.198
I'm your friend! Your fan!

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.951
Please surrender!

01:00:57.034 --> 01:01:01.205
What did you do for this guy Omar
you never did for me?

01:01:01.288 --> 01:01:03.374
Bloody bitch!

01:01:13.091 --> 01:01:15.176
Oh, shit! Look out!

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.543
Hey, Omar! Eat rocks!

01:01:51.462 --> 01:01:52.963
Let's go.

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:23.825
I got something.

01:02:27.913 --> 01:02:30.082
Nubians.

01:02:30.165 --> 01:02:32.501
I was hoping to avoid them.

01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:41.635
Sell any books here?

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:48.641
- Main man! Hey, my man!
- What are you so happy about?

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:52.978
Just keep smiling. Maybe they'll think
we're from <i>National Geographic.</i>

01:02:59.151 --> 01:03:01.237
Hey! How ya doin'?

01:03:32.474 --> 01:03:35.602
He says it's many days'
long trip over high mountains.

01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:38.313
And he wishes us a very pleasant journey.

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:42.735
Thank you.

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:46.947
All right. Thank you, guys.
Catch you next time. Goodbye.

01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:49.116
Come on, Jack.

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:58.041
Ah, Mr Jack! Just-Joan! The Chief's son, he
wishes to make a blessing for your marriage.

01:04:00.168 --> 01:04:02.628
We're not married.

01:04:23.273 --> 01:04:28.570
He says, because you are not married,
that his son wishes to court you.

01:04:28.987 --> 01:04:31.490
- Oh, I just...
- Oh, no, that's...

01:04:32.532 --> 01:04:36.828
That's very nice, but the lady is...
She's with me.

01:04:43.042 --> 01:04:48.339
He says that because there is more than
one suitor, that you must wrestle his son.

01:04:48.673 --> 01:04:50.758
I gotta wrestle his son?

01:04:55.846 --> 01:04:57.932
How ya doin'?

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.646
OK. This one I think I can handle.

01:05:04.312 --> 01:05:06.189
OK!

01:05:11.027 --> 01:05:12.278
No?

01:05:12.862 --> 01:05:14.948
<i>Hussein!</i>

01:05:34.883 --> 01:05:38.637
Wait a minute, guys.
Let's talk this over like gentlemen!

01:05:41.223 --> 01:05:43.684
All right. You guys are with me, huh?

01:05:43.767 --> 01:05:45.728
Yeah, me. All right.

01:05:45.811 --> 01:05:49.815
Do me a favour. Tell him
we lived together for six months. Shit.

01:05:49.898 --> 01:05:52.233
All right, what are the rules?

01:06:16.715 --> 01:06:18.884
Right.

01:06:30.479 --> 01:06:32.481
I'm sorry about that.

01:06:35.233 --> 01:06:37.486
No, not the left one! No!

01:06:41.572 --> 01:06:44.450
No pain, no gain.

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:46.619
Let me go!

01:06:53.167 --> 01:06:55.252
- No!
- Can we talk about this?

01:06:56.212 --> 01:06:58.297
Stop it!

01:06:58.798 --> 01:07:00.883
We have to do something!

01:07:01.591 --> 01:07:03.677
I am doing something.

01:07:24.822 --> 01:07:26.907
Joe, he's...

01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:34.805
- That was great!
- Great, huh? I could've gotten killed!

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:35.906
This is the marriage dance. In this tribe,
the women, they choose the man.

01:09:36.281 --> 01:09:40.703
And then, according to the custom,
they will be together for life.

01:09:40.786 --> 01:09:43.162
They get all that from one dance?

01:09:43.247 --> 01:09:44.915
It's beautiful!

01:09:50.377 --> 01:09:55.174
Ralph, if you want to be one of us,
take off your shoes and socks.

01:09:56.009 --> 01:09:59.762
If you want to be one of us,
you must see with the eyes of your heart,

01:09:59.846 --> 01:10:02.640
- not with the eyes of your head.
- Gotcha, yeah.

01:10:02.724 --> 01:10:05.977
Your heart will never give you fear or pain -

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.146
if you know our way.

01:10:10.313 --> 01:10:11.982
Ralph.

01:10:12.065 --> 01:10:15.402
No, thanks, pal. Keep your friggin' jewel.

01:10:15.485 --> 01:10:17.571
- No!
- Are you afraid?

01:10:18.488 --> 01:10:20.365
I just had my feet resoled.

01:10:20.657 --> 01:10:24.828
- What is the worst that can happen to you?
- I could wind up a Chicken McNugget.

01:10:24.911 --> 01:10:30.792
- What is the best that could happen to you?
- I could get through this and find the Jewel.

01:10:30.876 --> 01:10:32.960
It's your choice.

01:10:33.044 --> 01:10:35.129
Look down.

01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:40.718
Hot coals!

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:46.557
I did it! I did it! I'm one of us!

01:11:14.084 --> 01:11:16.169
All right! Yeah!

01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:44.320
Your fears - they make you foolish.

01:11:51.369 --> 01:11:53.454
Go to her, Jack.

01:13:15.616 --> 01:13:19.578
- I'm sorry I got people shooting at you again.
- You kidding?

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:22.998
We're the perfect couple
when we got people shooting at us.

01:13:23.082 --> 01:13:27.795
- Just the slow times I'm not too good at.
- I guess I just expect too much.

01:13:27.878 --> 01:13:29.963
Maybe we both expect too much.

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.260
Oh, boy.

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:39.389
Thank you for coming to Kadir with me.

01:14:07.457 --> 01:14:09.960
This valley is gift of the Nile.

01:14:18.593 --> 01:14:20.762
I've been away from here too long.

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:28.769
You know, I'm getting to like this guy Joe.
He's growing on me.

01:14:28.853 --> 01:14:32.189
What do you say we cut him in
on this jewel, if we ever find it?

01:14:32.273 --> 01:14:34.358
Jack...

01:14:35.151 --> 01:14:37.236
We have the Jewel.

01:14:38.237 --> 01:14:40.406
What are you talking about? Where?

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.284
Well, there.

01:14:46.954 --> 01:14:49.040
- What, Joe's got the Jewel?
- No.

01:14:50.498 --> 01:14:52.584
Joe is the Jewel.

01:14:56.254 --> 01:14:58.465
Joe is the Jewel of the Nile?

01:14:58.548 --> 01:15:02.719
He's a holy man. That's his religious title.

01:15:04.846 --> 01:15:07.140
Joe is the Jewel.

01:15:15.022 --> 01:15:18.817
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
Why'd you keep it from me?

01:15:18.901 --> 01:15:22.029
Because I thought if you knew,
you wouldn't come with us.

01:15:22.112 --> 01:15:24.198
Maybe I would've surprised you.

01:15:25.074 --> 01:15:29.078
I think I've come through once or twice,
if I remember right.

01:15:29.161 --> 01:15:31.872
I'm sorry.

01:15:31.955 --> 01:15:34.875
You're right. You come through all the time.

01:15:42.465 --> 01:15:44.550
It's funny.

01:15:45.593 --> 01:15:48.096
I really thought we had a chance.

01:16:03.151 --> 01:16:05.153
Look! The train to Kadir!

01:16:05.237 --> 01:16:08.448
Come on, Jack.
<i>Inshallah,</i> we'll be there tonight.

01:16:08.532 --> 01:16:12.703
- What a lot of people!
- They are going to see the false redeemer.

01:16:12.786 --> 01:16:16.123
- Omar again, huh?
- We'll see about that.

01:16:52.073 --> 01:16:54.159
Shit!

01:18:04.059 --> 01:18:06.144
What are you doing?

01:18:06.603 --> 01:18:08.897
Come on!

01:18:09.147 --> 01:18:10.816
Jump!

01:18:14.486 --> 01:18:15.904
No!

01:18:46.766 --> 01:18:48.852
No! Hang on, Joan!

01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:09.330
Jack, watch out!

01:19:09.413 --> 01:19:11.415
It's...

01:19:39.859 --> 01:19:43.655
Guys, wait up! Come on, Humphrey.
Go, go, go!

01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:55.290
Do something!

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.459
What do you want me to do?

01:21:30.214 --> 01:21:31.924
Colton!

01:21:33.509 --> 01:21:36.888
Your ass is grass,
and I'm a lawn mower, Colton!

01:21:36.971 --> 01:21:39.807
Colton, I'll get you! Colton, I'm on to ya!

01:22:13.256 --> 01:22:14.924
Colton.

01:23:10.394 --> 01:23:12.479
All right, yeah!

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:18.193
All right! Let's go, come on.
Let's get out of here!

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.118
Just-Joan, you're gre...

01:23:28.953 --> 01:23:30.830
Welcome.

01:23:30.913 --> 01:23:36.044
I don't usually travel by train,
but I had a small accident with my helicopter.

01:23:49.348 --> 01:23:51.642
May we reach Kadir in time.

01:24:14.497 --> 01:24:18.542
Once we get inside,
we must find the entrance to the catacombs.

01:24:19.418 --> 01:24:21.504
T-shirts! Buy T-shirts!

01:24:21.587 --> 01:24:26.050
Gimme the T-shirt.
I'll buy it, I'll buy it. Get outta here, will ya?

01:24:46.319 --> 01:24:50.198
You know, I really admire
your loyalty to each other.

01:24:50.907 --> 01:24:54.828
And I'm going to give you a chance
to be together to the very end.

01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:56.788
Well, not exactly.

01:24:56.871 --> 01:24:59.999
One will watch the other die.

01:25:05.129 --> 01:25:07.214
But which one?

01:25:08.882 --> 01:25:10.968
Rachid.

01:25:12.678 --> 01:25:15.931
- Is that the goat's blood?
- Yes.

01:25:16.015 --> 01:25:20.102
Very popular
with the inhabitants of these catacombs.

01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:24.814
- Rats.
- Yes. They eat until they get the last drop.

01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:28.234
But don't worry, Mr Colton.
You won't be alone.

01:25:29.027 --> 01:25:34.157
Rachid is now placing acid
that will eat through Miss Wilder's rope.

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.160
What kind of sick pervert
would go to this trouble?

01:25:37.619 --> 01:25:39.621
- Why don't you shoot us?!
- Jack!

01:25:39.704 --> 01:25:43.625
What kind of demented psychopath
would even think of this?

01:25:43.833 --> 01:25:46.335
- <i>The Savage Secret.</i>
- What?

01:25:47.502 --> 01:25:49.379
Was my biggest seller.

01:25:53.634 --> 01:25:58.263
Think about this pit
as your last adventure, Joan Wilder.

01:25:59.723 --> 01:26:02.017
My people await me.

01:26:22.203 --> 01:26:25.748
What you talkin' about?
I work with professional people.

01:26:25.831 --> 01:26:29.835
You tell His Highness
the show starts with him or without him.

01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:41.721
Goddamn beanie convention.
Wind up goin' home with a rug.

01:26:41.805 --> 01:26:43.890
The entrance!

01:26:55.025 --> 01:26:57.319
Give me a red to the yellow. And cue!

01:26:59.196 --> 01:27:01.740
I said give me a red gel down there!

01:27:07.621 --> 01:27:10.666
And cue! For Gawd's sake, cue!

01:27:35.273 --> 01:27:38.276
Build it, build it softly.
And give me some smoke.

01:28:08.638 --> 01:28:13.059
That's good, that's good, that's very good.
Now, bring it up slowly.

01:29:30.258 --> 01:29:32.719
There are many rooms and many ways.

01:29:32.802 --> 01:29:35.013
You! You go this way.

01:29:35.096 --> 01:29:37.390
And, you! You go this way.

01:29:37.473 --> 01:29:39.933
And we: We go this way.

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:03.080
Boy, it stinks in this place.

01:30:07.418 --> 01:30:10.046
What looks good, amigo?

01:30:10.129 --> 01:30:14.008
You go from this way. And... I go this way.

01:30:14.091 --> 01:30:16.177
All right.

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.055
What a fruit loop.

01:30:20.598 --> 01:30:22.683
- How'd they get out?
- What?

01:30:22.767 --> 01:30:25.727
In <i>The Savage Secret,</i> how'd they get out?

01:30:27.562 --> 01:30:30.440
Jesse had a knife hidden in his boot.

01:30:31.733 --> 01:30:34.736
You wouldn't happen to have a knife,
would ya?

01:30:34.819 --> 01:30:37.864
- I'm not even wearing underwear.
- Great!

01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:41.076
No!

01:31:00.302 --> 01:31:03.013
We were good together,
weren't we, Joan Wilder?

01:31:03.097 --> 01:31:05.266
The best.

01:31:05.349 --> 01:31:08.269
- And we're gonna make it.
- Yeah.

01:31:11.605 --> 01:31:14.023
Oh, God. I love you, lady.

01:31:14.107 --> 01:31:16.025
I love you, Jack.

01:31:16.359 --> 01:31:18.444
Will you marry me?

01:31:19.737 --> 01:31:23.032
- Yes!
- Because I never want you leaving me again.

01:31:23.741 --> 01:31:27.745
You're not just saying that
because this is it, are you?

01:31:29.455 --> 01:31:33.501
I'm saying it
because I'm not afraid to say it any more.

01:31:47.764 --> 01:31:51.059
So where do you wanna go
on our honeymoon?

01:32:12.538 --> 01:32:16.709
Rats! Get out of here, you...
Goddamn rat farm! Go on!

01:32:17.084 --> 01:32:22.797
- Ralph! Get us out of here, will ya?
- Ah! And there's the biggest rat of all.

01:32:23.715 --> 01:32:25.800
Colton, look at you. You...

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:29.387
You don't know how many nights
I dreamed of this.

01:32:29.471 --> 01:32:34.893
- Except your flesh was torn off your body.
- Ralph, please, just help us down.

01:32:34.976 --> 01:32:37.062
Jack! Hold on!

01:32:38.355 --> 01:32:41.107
Well, well, well, Colton.

01:32:41.191 --> 01:32:45.653
I think this calls for a renegotiation.
Don't you, Tarzan? Huh?

01:32:45.736 --> 01:32:48.989
This looks a little bit more like 70-30.

01:32:49.073 --> 01:32:53.577
- Or maybe even 80-20.
- Ralph, will ya get the rats off that rope?!

01:32:54.203 --> 01:32:58.499
- I don't go near rats, buddy.
- Ralph, do not be afraid.

01:32:59.959 --> 01:33:02.670
Remember the Sufi way: See with your heart.

01:33:03.295 --> 01:33:07.091
My heart sees rats, Pop.
Don't let this garb fool you.

01:33:07.174 --> 01:33:09.425
Come on, Colton. Where's the Jewel?

01:33:09.509 --> 01:33:13.846
Ralph, I am the Jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.

01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:17.058
And I'm a kumquat from Queens.
Pipe down, towel-head!

01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:20.311
- Come on, Ralph.
- Take the ladder and put it over the well.

01:33:20.395 --> 01:33:24.065
- Please, don't let us die!
- That's a good idea, Legs.

01:33:24.148 --> 01:33:29.570
I ain't gonna let you die, but I ain't movin' no
ladder until you come across with the rock!

01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:45.877
Lookin' more like 90-10! Huh, kumquat?

01:33:47.754 --> 01:33:51.592
- Did you get the ladder all right?
- Jack, help me unlock the Jewel.

01:33:51.675 --> 01:33:56.387
The Jewel? You mean you weren't
shittin' me? That guy really is the Jewel?

01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:59.599
Come on.
We still got time to stop Omar. Let's go.

01:34:00.725 --> 01:34:03.686
Ralph, that is not the Sufi way.

01:34:03.769 --> 01:34:08.983
I don't know what got into me, Jewels. Every
time I'm around this guy he makes me crazy.

01:34:09.066 --> 01:34:13.279
Come on. Tell him to cut me down, Jewels.
Come on, huh?

01:34:58.447 --> 01:35:02.159
Don't fuck around with the equipment!
Bloody woman!

01:35:26.266 --> 01:35:28.351
Here they come, Jack.

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.251
Oh, my God. Look at this. Looks like
Our Lady of Mount Palmer schoolyard.

01:35:56.752 --> 01:35:58.671
Hold it!

01:36:02.967 --> 01:36:05.678
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

01:36:07.305 --> 01:36:08.973
Oh, Rachid.

01:36:09.056 --> 01:36:13.102
How ya doin'? Let's talk this over
before you butcher me alive.

01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:15.688
What are you getting so steamed about?

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:21.026
Look at that. It worked!

01:38:01.372 --> 01:38:03.541
Get over the wall. Come on!

01:38:03.916 --> 01:38:06.002
Get goin'.

01:38:10.965 --> 01:38:13.050
Keep going.

01:38:38.824 --> 01:38:42.286
I knew we'd hook up again, Colton. Get it?

01:38:45.039 --> 01:38:47.166
I swear to God!

01:38:47.249 --> 01:38:49.335
My right hand to God!

01:38:49.418 --> 01:38:51.503
Come on!

01:39:32.417 --> 01:39:37.631
I am dead, Miss Wilder.
All that will be written for Omar is an epitaph.

01:39:38.006 --> 01:39:40.092
But I will not be alone.

01:39:49.767 --> 01:39:52.311
Who is going to save you now?

01:39:54.981 --> 01:39:56.440
Who?

01:40:37.563 --> 01:40:39.648
Well, you got your story.

01:40:40.608 --> 01:40:42.693
I got a lot more than that.

01:41:06.799 --> 01:41:08.593
You are married!

01:41:38.497 --> 01:41:41.208
Always a bridesmaid, never the bride.

01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:43.793
As usual, it's zilch for poor Ralphie.

01:41:46.712 --> 01:41:48.798
You are Sufi.

01:41:50.883 --> 01:41:52.969
Keep it always.

01:41:54.345 --> 01:41:56.430
Guys!

01:41:58.808 --> 01:42:00.893
Sufis rule!

01:45:45.733 --> 01:45:48.236
