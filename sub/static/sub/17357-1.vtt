00:06.853 --> 00:08.543
Ghosts tend to stick around

00:08.544 --> 00:12.782
when they have some kind
of unfinished business.

00:12.783 --> 00:15.466
Oftentimes, the type of haunting

00:15.467 --> 00:17.987
will give me some sort of insight

00:18.051 --> 00:20.272
into what that unfinished business is.

00:20.273 --> 00:22.192
And finishing unfinished business,

00:22.193 --> 00:25.276
well, that literally is my business.

00:27.196 --> 00:29.481
Let's get down to it.

00:29.482 --> 00:31.270
These disturbances

00:31.271 --> 00:34.086
of which we spake over
the phone at great lengths,

00:34.087 --> 00:36.472
would you mind walking me through it again?

00:36.473 --> 00:39.654
Evidently, I didn't write anything down,

00:39.655 --> 00:42.104
so all of it would be helpful.

00:42.105 --> 00:45.119
Things move around in the attic at night.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.207
We hear creaking. The
exterminator find nothing.

00:47.208 --> 00:49.029
And then one day, my wife,

00:49.030 --> 00:52.078
she find this under her pillow.

00:52.079 --> 00:53.272
Mm.

00:55.292 --> 00:58.008
- I've seen this before.
- What is it?

00:58.009 --> 01:00.393
I'm trying to think of
the most delicate way

01:00.394 --> 01:02.911
to say this without offending you.

01:02.912 --> 01:05.960
Scrabble? It's a popular word game.

01:05.961 --> 01:07.950
You make words out of
these cute tiles here.

01:08.809 --> 01:10.101
It doesn't matter.

01:10.102 --> 01:12.423
The point is that I think this is a crue.

01:14.011 --> 01:15.866
Clue. This is a clue.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.854
So, what does the A mean?

01:17.855 --> 01:19.807
The A? Oh, yes.

01:19.808 --> 01:21.298
I have no idea.

01:21.299 --> 01:23.754
I'll have to ask the ghost.

All right, here we are.

02:04.737 --> 02:07.684
Why don't we start with this?

02:07.685 --> 02:11.461
You obviously chose this tile for a reason.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.350
Right?

02:13.351 --> 02:16.596
You guys do everything
for a reason, don't ya?

02:16.597 --> 02:18.089
Hm?

02:19.512 --> 02:21.039
Herro?

02:22.693 --> 02:26.008
Oh, f... king f... king, f... k fart!

02:29.221 --> 02:31.638
What is it? What?

02:31.639 --> 02:33.960
Oh, what's this?

02:35.382 --> 02:36.709
A...

02:38.034 --> 02:39.291
Ang... Ang...

02:39.292 --> 02:41.446
Ang... Angina.

02:41.447 --> 02:44.593
Ang... ange... Angus. Angus burger.

02:44.594 --> 02:47.144
Please, tell me you're spelling
"Angus burger" right now.

02:47.145 --> 02:49.264
I remember this one time
I had an Angus patty,

02:49.265 --> 02:51.617
it was so juicy, I didn't
just eat that thing,

02:51.618 --> 02:54.267
I literally performed cunnilangus on it.

02:54.268 --> 02:56.421
La-la-la-la-la. I'm gonna
stop you right there.

02:56.422 --> 02:58.409
No, no, let me just
finish this Angus memory.

02:58.410 --> 03:00.364
Angus? But I'm spelling Angie.

03:00.365 --> 03:02.021
Uh, Angie.

03:02.022 --> 03:03.511
Oh, whoa.

03:03.512 --> 03:06.327
Can you...? Oh, my.

03:06.328 --> 03:08.749
- Who are you?
- Name is Kevin Pacalioglu.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.999
I know it's a bit of a mouthful.
You can just call me Pac.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.357
That's what all my friends call me.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.980
Well, my friend.

03:13.981 --> 03:15.140
My drug dealer.

03:15.141 --> 03:17.029
Why are you here?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.714
Because Mr. and Mrs. Lee downstairs

03:19.780 --> 03:21.669
said that you've been haunting their house,

03:21.736 --> 03:23.390
and they've asked me
to come and help, Angie.

03:23.391 --> 03:25.146
Oh, no, no, I'm actually Daniel.

03:25.147 --> 03:27.299
Daniel. Who's Angie then?

03:27.300 --> 03:30.747
Angela, my girlfriend, she
used to live in this house,

03:30.748 --> 03:32.700
and we'd come up here and make out,

03:32.701 --> 03:35.848
and I really thought
she was gonna be the one.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.908
What happened?

03:36.909 --> 03:38.299
The war.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.155
I joined the army, and
within the first week,

03:40.156 --> 03:42.042
got a bullet through the back of my head.

03:42.043 --> 03:45.191
Worst part about it is, I
never got to see any action.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.609
Mm, right, because of your head hole?

03:47.610 --> 03:49.233
Well, no, actually, I never, um,

03:49.234 --> 03:52.214
even got to fire my
gun, you catch my drift?

03:52.215 --> 03:53.739
Yeah, I thought I did,

03:53.740 --> 03:55.660
until you just said
"if you catch my drift."

03:55.661 --> 03:57.747
I never got to have sex. I died a virgin.

03:57.748 --> 03:59.407
Ah, yes.

03:59.472 --> 04:01.657
Got it, okay, you were
gonna bring her up here

04:01.658 --> 04:04.175
and bareback her on that
ratty old mattress over there.

04:04.176 --> 04:06.164
Romantic. Got it. That's
why you're still here.

04:06.165 --> 04:08.814
Hey, this may sound crazy,
but since you can hear me,

04:08.815 --> 04:10.602
maybe there's something else you can do.

04:10.603 --> 04:12.425
If you're talking about a possession,

04:12.426 --> 04:13.882
you are out of luck.

04:13.883 --> 04:15.638
I do not do that anymore.

04:15.639 --> 04:17.891
So isn't there something else we can do

04:17.892 --> 04:19.548
so I can pay my rent and you can move on?

04:19.550 --> 04:22.033
I'm here for Angela, that's it.

04:22.034 --> 04:24.452
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

04:24.453 --> 04:26.341
- That's clever.
- I know.

04:26.342 --> 04:27.733
- Ha-ha-ha!
- But really.

04:27.734 --> 04:28.925
- You're serious?
- Very.

04:28.926 --> 04:30.550
Shit.

04:38.269 --> 04:40.620
So how you doin', Pac?

04:40.621 --> 04:42.443
A happy meal, please.

04:42.444 --> 04:44.034
You always get the happy meals.

04:46.253 --> 04:49.038
Ooh. Come on, man, you're a little light.

04:49.103 --> 04:50.560
You're a little dark.

04:50.561 --> 04:52.150
I can't keep floatin' you like this.

04:52.151 --> 04:53.840
- Come on, Roof.
- Ehh...

04:53.841 --> 04:55.762
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you want me to say.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.518
I'm not gettin' jobs like I used to, okay.

04:57.519 --> 04:59.971
People are living longer,
so there's fewer ghosts,

05:00.037 --> 05:02.190
and everybody's so
desensitized to these hauntings

05:02.191 --> 05:04.243
because of the paranormal festivity movies.

05:04.244 --> 05:08.218
Plus, you know, I've just
gotten, like, so lazy.

05:08.219 --> 05:10.538
I think you're sellin' yourself short, man.

05:10.539 --> 05:12.095
- Am I?
- You got a prodigious ability.

05:12.096 --> 05:13.520
You got to capitalize on that.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.542
You don't charge your clients enough.

05:15.543 --> 05:17.198
My clients are usually more willing

05:17.199 --> 05:19.119
to put up with the ghosts
than they are with me.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.577
Okay, whatever. It's your life.

05:20.578 --> 05:22.168
- It is my life.
- Your life.

05:22.169 --> 05:24.423
And I wanna be high, heh.

05:28.894 --> 05:32.305
A my guest today is
celebrated paranormal communicator

05:32.306 --> 05:33.435
Miss Camomile White.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.749
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

05:36.813 --> 05:38.899
Lovely to see you. Thank
you, ladies and gentlemen.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.953
Miss Camomile White has graced us

05:40.954 --> 05:42.809
with a new book that she has entitled,

05:42.810 --> 05:44.465
The Ghost Who Came Inside.

05:44.466 --> 05:45.957
Nice title.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.282
I will be appearing

05:47.283 --> 05:49.335
at the Occult Classics Bookstore

05:49.336 --> 05:51.257
tomorrow for a book signing.

05:51.258 --> 05:53.114
She's so dreamy.

05:53.115 --> 05:55.896
You gotta go down to that book
signing and spark up a convo.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.187
- What?
- Mm-hm.

05:57.188 --> 05:59.010
No, a girl like her, and a guy like me,

05:59.011 --> 06:01.925
we're from different worlds, we can't talk.

06:01.926 --> 06:04.545
- It would never work.
-  Come on, y'all both mediums.

06:04.611 --> 06:07.193
But she's a celebrity, she's beautiful.

06:07.194 --> 06:09.712
I'm just, like, this lowly jackass

06:09.713 --> 06:11.567
who can't even afford his rent.

06:11.568 --> 06:13.025
Matter of fact, I might be homeless

06:13.026 --> 06:14.749
by the time I finish this joint.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.801
I am gonna have to go
through with this possession.

06:16.802 --> 06:19.552
This teenager was a
soldier and died in the war.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.840
This poor kid, he died a virgin.

06:23.197 --> 06:25.352
He just wants my body to
have sex with his girlfriend.

06:25.417 --> 06:26.642
Wait, wait, wait. You got a job,

06:26.643 --> 06:28.099
all you gotta do is get laid to get paid?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.524
Yeah.

06:29.525 --> 06:31.016
When's the last time you had sex?

06:31.017 --> 06:32.606
I don't know. What's today, Friday?

06:32.607 --> 06:33.634
Tuesday.

06:33.635 --> 06:35.786
Tuesday. Okay, so like...

06:35.787 --> 06:37.843
Eight years ago.

06:42.016 --> 06:45.030
Danny, the virgin, I've reconsidered.

06:45.031 --> 06:47.482
- I'm gonna bone your girlfriend.
- Really?

06:47.483 --> 06:49.371
I'm gonna bone your
girlfriend, my good man!

06:49.372 --> 06:51.392
Ghost high-five! All right!

06:51.393 --> 06:53.347
Okay, two things.

06:53.348 --> 06:55.268
First thing, is she attractive?

06:55.269 --> 06:57.289
- She's beautiful.
- Oh, thank God.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.642
Two, this is a one-time deal, right?

06:59.643 --> 07:00.835
I'm not coming back every time

07:00.836 --> 07:02.693
time you wanna dip the old wick. You are...

07:03.552 --> 07:05.473
I just wanna get laid.

07:05.474 --> 07:08.358
Where does she live?

07:16.638 --> 07:18.129
Ah, hi.

07:18.130 --> 07:21.112
Ah, Miss Diinooki, I hope?

07:21.113 --> 07:23.761
It's Dinucci. Can I help you?

07:23.762 --> 07:25.917
Ho, oh, wow.

07:25.983 --> 07:27.471
Ah, yes.

07:27.472 --> 07:29.361
This is gonna sound a little bit strange.

07:29.362 --> 07:31.613
I understand that. Here it goes, anyway.

07:31.614 --> 07:35.490
I have been sent here by
Daniel, your boyfriend who died.

07:35.491 --> 07:37.878
He's haunting a house that
I've been hired to exorcise,

07:37.943 --> 07:39.865
and the only way that he will move on

07:39.932 --> 07:41.983
is if he can possess my body

07:41.984 --> 07:45.397
and use it as a vessel with
which to make love to you.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.553
With me.

07:49.075 --> 07:51.095
- I'm here to f... k you.
- I'm calling the cops.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.520
No, no cops! No cops!

07:52.521 --> 07:54.442
I'm not gonna have sex with you.

07:54.443 --> 07:57.059
Technically, you'd be having
sex with your boyfriend,

07:57.060 --> 07:59.477
so no harm, no foul. I'm a lesbian.

07:59.478 --> 08:01.863
That's just a phase. You're in mourning.

08:01.864 --> 08:03.288
- For who?
- For whom?

08:03.289 --> 08:05.375
I don't know what you're saying.

08:05.376 --> 08:07.364
Eh, let's try this again, okay?

08:07.365 --> 08:10.049
Here.

08:11.438 --> 08:13.160
Hi there. Are you Angie Dinooki?

08:13.161 --> 08:14.387
- No.
- No. Okay,

08:14.388 --> 08:16.275
is there anybody here by that name?

08:16.276 --> 08:18.131
Yeah, she's watching her program.

08:18.132 --> 08:19.955
Nonna!

08:20.749 --> 08:23.069
What is it, bellissima?

08:24.327 --> 08:27.277
Oh, that war.

08:36.586 --> 08:40.792
Ms. Dinucci, I should really
explain myself a little better.

08:40.793 --> 08:42.116
Save it, Casanova.

08:42.118 --> 08:43.874
My granddaughter already told me

08:43.875 --> 08:45.729
all about your little spiel.

08:45.730 --> 08:48.744
Okay, look, trust me,
I know when I tell you

08:48.745 --> 08:51.561
there are spirits that stick
around in the human realm

08:51.562 --> 08:53.781
for a long time after they've passed.

08:53.782 --> 08:54.907
Yeah, sure, I believe that.

08:54.908 --> 08:56.499
I watch that Camomile White

08:56.500 --> 08:58.087
every time she's on one of my programs.

08:58.088 --> 08:59.678
I like her.

08:59.679 --> 09:01.402
But that doesn't mean I go along with it.

09:01.403 --> 09:02.494
What? Why? Why not?

09:02.495 --> 09:04.913
My Daniel was a beautiful boy.

09:04.914 --> 09:08.922
He had a face like Rudolph Valentino.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.533
A culo you could eat the real scarpino.

09:12.534 --> 09:14.853
- Oh, really?
- Look, I'm sorry,

09:14.854 --> 09:17.571
but my answer is no.

09:19.789 --> 09:20.915
Okay.

09:20.916 --> 09:23.105
You should know though,

09:23.170 --> 09:26.284
that if I hadn't taken about
20 of your goiter analgesics,

09:26.285 --> 09:28.635
drank a half a bottle of cough syrup,

09:28.636 --> 09:31.319
and popped about 15 of those sugar cubes,

09:31.320 --> 09:34.005
I would be utterly heartbroken right now.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.787
Good day, sir.

10:45.734 --> 10:48.946
"Even though he was gone,

10:48.947 --> 10:51.897
"I could feel him around me,

10:51.898 --> 10:53.584
inside me.

10:53.585 --> 10:56.601
A gentle breeze wafted through the bedroom

10:56.602 --> 11:00.112
and caressed my creamy
white immaculate thighs.

11:00.113 --> 11:02.828
I thought about closing the window,

11:02.829 --> 11:04.651
but when I looked over,

11:04.652 --> 11:06.738
I saw that it was already

11:06.739 --> 11:08.762
closed."

11:11.013 --> 11:13.133
Thank you so much for that, Miss White.

11:13.134 --> 11:16.413
That was paranormal erotica at its finest.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.414
Thank you.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.740
Okay, I'd like to open it up

11:18.741 --> 11:20.595
to the audience for some questions.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.151
I have a question.

11:22.152 --> 11:23.774
So Occult Classics has been

11:23.775 --> 11:25.763
in my family for three generations.

11:25.764 --> 11:29.742
My grandfather actually died here.

11:30.701 --> 11:32.754
There were some odd circumstances

11:32.755 --> 11:34.411
surrounding his death,

11:34.412 --> 11:35.717
and I don't mean to put you on the spot,

11:35.718 --> 11:37.552
but I was hoping right here
in front of all these people,

11:37.553 --> 11:39.802
you could maybe tell me exactly

11:39.803 --> 11:42.132
what happened the night that he died.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.963
I see him.

11:52.964 --> 11:54.455
I see your grandfather.

11:54.456 --> 11:58.624
But I see some negative energy around him.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.909
Is... is that making sense to you?

12:01.910 --> 12:05.157
Um, not really. He died in a fire.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.244
- A fire!
- Yes!

12:07.245 --> 12:09.199
Yes, yes, I see it.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.789
I see a fire.

12:10.790 --> 12:14.831
He actually died trying
to put out that fire.

12:14.832 --> 12:17.350
He died trying to save

12:17.351 --> 12:20.300
this bookstore that he loved.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.214
- Ah.
- I hated this place.

12:23.215 --> 12:25.101
I was the one who started the fire.

12:25.102 --> 12:27.524
Wait, you didn't talk to her?

12:27.588 --> 12:28.945
She made all that up?

12:28.946 --> 12:30.867
Wait, you can hear me?

12:30.868 --> 12:32.324
Wait, she can't hear you?

12:32.325 --> 12:34.182
- Wait.
- Wait.

12:35.573 --> 12:37.957
Camomile White is a fraud?

12:37.958 --> 12:40.445
Hey, if you can hear me,

12:40.509 --> 12:42.198
you need to tell these people the truth.

12:42.199 --> 12:44.683
No, no, I'm not gonna be
the meat in that sandwich.

12:44.684 --> 12:46.903
I've been trapped here for 20 years.

12:46.904 --> 12:48.790
I don't want to be remembered as a martyr

12:48.791 --> 12:50.481
for a place I didn't give a damn about.

12:50.482 --> 12:52.104
- Say something, you!
- No!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.496
Just... just... you just...

12:53.497 --> 12:55.355
- Excuse me.
- What?

12:55.419 --> 12:57.342
We're having a moment here.

12:57.407 --> 13:01.574
I'm so sorry, I'm just having
my own moment over here.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.429
That's okay, love, you're
just a bit confused.

13:04.430 --> 13:08.598
You know, my powers can
be pretty scary to people

13:08.970 --> 13:11.686
when they don't understand how they work.

13:11.687 --> 13:13.541
I... I understand them just fine.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.193
I... I am, myself,

13:16.260 --> 13:17.848
actually a medium.

13:17.849 --> 13:19.571
Really?

13:19.572 --> 13:21.661
'Cause to me, you look more like a large.

13:24.276 --> 13:26.496
You're gonna take that?
Stand up for yourself.

13:26.497 --> 13:28.548
Set me free.

13:28.549 --> 13:30.868
Now, if you don't mind, medium.

13:30.869 --> 13:32.758
Actually, Shelly,

13:32.759 --> 13:35.408
I don't mind.

13:35.409 --> 13:38.721
I don't mind, big time, okay?

13:38.722 --> 13:41.636
Your grandfather didn't die
trying to save this place.

13:41.637 --> 13:43.625
He died trying to set this thing on fire.

13:43.626 --> 13:45.314
The only reason he had it

13:45.315 --> 13:46.973
in the first place was because...

13:47.038 --> 13:48.793
Grandmother loved to read.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.146
Your grandmother loved
to read so much, you know,

13:51.147 --> 13:52.603
and when then she died, he was like,

13:52.604 --> 13:54.294
"good, get rid of it. I don't want it."

13:54.295 --> 13:56.880
So he decided he was gonna... burn it.

13:56.944 --> 13:58.900
Stage a fire, collect the insurance money,

13:58.966 --> 14:00.889
- and open up...
- The restaurant.

14:00.954 --> 14:02.477
The restaurant he'd dreamed of having,

14:02.478 --> 14:05.225
and name it Ralphie's, after his son,

14:05.226 --> 14:07.814
your father, and if the
restaurant didn't start

14:07.877 --> 14:09.500
paying for itself after the first quarter,

14:09.501 --> 14:11.124
he was gonna light another fire,

14:11.125 --> 14:12.784
and burn that sucker down,

14:12.847 --> 14:15.034
and... uh...

14:15.035 --> 14:16.458
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm being told

14:16.459 --> 14:18.545
to shut my mouth by the ghost,

14:18.546 --> 14:20.136
because I have said enough already.

14:20.137 --> 14:22.223
That does make sense.

14:22.224 --> 14:24.114
We good?

14:25.967 --> 14:28.253
Grandpa was a shyster,

14:28.254 --> 14:30.208
and gam-gam loved to read,

14:30.209 --> 14:32.361
and she hated when I called
her gam-gam, and she...

14:32.362 --> 14:34.216
How did you know all that?

14:34.217 --> 14:38.324
Ahhhh-mooo!

14:38.325 --> 14:41.009
A-boon deshift deshy-a!

14:41.010 --> 14:42.602
Tooak-eenee!

14:42.666 --> 14:46.047
Shamm-a-hiya! Cach!

15:00.890 --> 15:04.036
Cool, tag sale.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.858
Fun.

15:05.859 --> 15:07.713
What do we got?

15:07.714 --> 15:09.801
Ah, I already have all this stuff.

15:09.802 --> 15:11.490
Wait a second.

15:11.491 --> 15:14.173
Ah! Just the man

15:14.174 --> 15:16.363
I was hoping never to see again in my life.

15:16.428 --> 15:17.884
You're out!

15:17.885 --> 15:19.840
No, wait, you can't just
sell all my treasures.

15:19.841 --> 15:21.959
I mean, my giant remote?

15:21.960 --> 15:24.314
I was hoping it would pay
back the three months' rent,

15:24.378 --> 15:25.935
but this is worthless!

15:25.936 --> 15:27.958
No one wants a plunger that says "mama."

15:27.959 --> 15:29.581
It says "moma."

15:29.582 --> 15:31.003
It's from the museum. It's probably art!

15:31.004 --> 15:32.792
- No one wants it!
- I want it!

15:32.793 --> 15:35.480
I'll take everything. How much?

15:36.307 --> 15:38.824
I give you everything for 500.

15:38.825 --> 15:40.480
- Thirty.
- Deal.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.805
You still owe me rent!

15:41.806 --> 15:44.425
- Tabboulleh!
- I'm coming!

15:46.180 --> 15:49.855
Look, I've been thinkin'
a lot about Daniel,

15:49.856 --> 15:51.546
and when we were young,

15:51.547 --> 15:54.562
he used to write me
letters, and on the envelope

15:54.563 --> 15:56.815
he would always just
put one single letter a.

15:56.816 --> 16:00.063
And when I saw that tile
that you left the other day,

16:00.129 --> 16:02.248
it reminded me of that, and him,

16:02.249 --> 16:04.270
and how much he meant to me.

16:04.271 --> 16:06.357
So...

16:06.358 --> 16:07.982
So maybe you're not my type,

16:08.046 --> 16:10.963
but it's just something I gotta do.

16:11.029 --> 16:12.221
I'm in.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.076
You're in? Oh, yes!

16:14.077 --> 16:16.163
Oh, my God, you have no
idea how happy that makes me.

16:16.164 --> 16:19.444
Today has just been like
the worst day of all time.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.566
Hang on, hang on.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.214
Oh, God.

16:24.215 --> 16:26.534
- What's that?
- Magic mushrooms.

16:26.535 --> 16:29.017
See, for a possession like this to work,

16:29.018 --> 16:32.200
my mind needs to be in a
more mushiable, dark state.

16:32.201 --> 16:36.343
Basically, I need to
go on a really bad trip.

16:51.815 --> 16:54.232
Did you get any lube?

16:54.233 --> 16:56.355
All they had was this kimchi mayo.

17:02.681 --> 17:05.334
You... you feelin' the mushrooms yet?

17:08.711 --> 17:10.368
It's hard to really tell.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.827
Here.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.118
What's that?

17:18.119 --> 17:20.704
This is a list of my insecurities.

17:20.704 --> 17:22.825
Mushrooms only get me halfway there.

17:22.826 --> 17:25.411
I need to be broken down
emotionally and physically.

17:25.476 --> 17:27.266
If you would be so kind...

17:30.579 --> 17:32.369
Please.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.520
"You're a loser.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.673
Your only friend is your drug dealer."

17:36.674 --> 17:38.960
Your breath smells like spoiled concetta.

17:38.961 --> 17:40.617
Wait, is that on there?

17:40.618 --> 17:42.042
Ah, just a pitch.

17:42.043 --> 17:43.996
"You've been in the same
business for ten years

17:43.997 --> 17:45.586
and you have nothing to show for it.

17:45.587 --> 17:47.773
You finally met the girl of your dreams

17:47.774 --> 17:49.761
and now you got your heart broken

17:49.762 --> 17:52.047
because she turned out not
to be who you thought she was,

17:52.048 --> 17:53.969
so you gave up on love,

17:53.970 --> 17:57.019
and you're resolved to spend
the rest of your life alone."

18:08.282 --> 18:09.904
Daniel?

18:09.905 --> 18:11.630
Daniel!

18:13.352 --> 18:15.802
Daniel,

18:15.803 --> 18:18.586
I can't believe it's really you.

18:18.587 --> 18:20.974
It's been so long.

18:23.588 --> 18:26.471
You're more beautiful than
the day that I shipped off.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.759
I'm so glad I get a second chance.

18:35.119 --> 18:36.512
Are you ready?

19:08.185 --> 19:10.074
Oh, my God.

19:17.296 --> 19:19.383
So you wanna go again?

19:19.384 --> 19:22.197
You know it's just me
now, right, Mrs. Dinucci?

19:22.198 --> 19:23.358
I'm game if you are.

19:23.359 --> 19:25.114
Yeah.

19:25.115 --> 19:27.168
Oh, I see.

19:27.169 --> 19:28.927
Ooh.

19:37.837 --> 19:39.626
That's him. Stop the car.

19:39.627 --> 19:42.044
Hey, you!

19:42.045 --> 19:43.453
Hey.

19:43.454 --> 19:46.039
Listen to me, you hungry hungry hippo.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.828
Ah!

19:47.829 --> 19:49.682
I don't know who you
are, or what your game is,

19:49.683 --> 19:52.366
but if you ever pull a
stunt like that again,

19:52.367 --> 19:54.487
I will rip off your balls and turn them

19:54.488 --> 19:56.906
into tiny mini dangling earrings.

19:56.907 --> 19:59.489
- Am I making myself clear?
- Yes, perfectly.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.576
Don't you ever contradict me.

20:01.577 --> 20:02.769
I was just trying to help.

20:02.770 --> 20:04.426
I don't need your help.

20:04.427 --> 20:06.680
No, I mean I was just
trying to help somebody else.

20:06.681 --> 20:08.832
No one else needs your help. I help people.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.257
I give them closure.

20:10.258 --> 20:13.239
How does vomiting blue slushie

20:13.240 --> 20:15.128
help give people closure?

20:15.129 --> 20:18.508
But why would you say that?

20:20.098 --> 20:21.524
Uh, because it...

20:22.550 --> 20:26.827
Tiny little dangling earrings.

20:27.654 --> 20:29.309
- Clear?
- Yes.

20:29.310 --> 20:32.426
Yes. Yes.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.253
Get in the car now!

20:58.537 --> 21:01.618
Ah! Oh.
