02:12.125 --> 02:14.058
Excuse me.

02:18.726 --> 02:20.359
Oh, I just.

02:24.526 --> 02:27.359
They're not all for me,
they're my son's favourites.

02:27.392 --> 02:28.659
Mine, too.

02:28.692 --> 02:30.492
Dr. Malcolm to Ward 3.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.559
Dr. Malcolm to Ward 3.

02:43.259 --> 02:45.392
Have a great night.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.659
No, no!

05:05.125 --> 05:07.592
Get out of my house!

05:08.659 --> 05:10.225
Get out of my fucking house.

05:10.259 --> 05:12.225
Open the door!

05:12.259 --> 05:14.259
I have your phone.

05:17.792 --> 05:19.759
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:19.792 --> 05:22.759
I'm not here to hurt you.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.759
I'm not here to hurt you.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.726
You remember?
You remember me?

05:28.759 --> 05:30.692
I don't.

05:34.225 --> 05:37.225
I'm gonna slowly just back out
into this bathroom.

05:38.559 --> 05:41.158
And we're gonna go downstairs,

05:41.192 --> 05:43.259
and we're gonna sit down, and
we're gonna talk about this.

05:43.292 --> 05:46.259
Now I know right now, that
my word right now doesn't

05:46.292 --> 05:49.092
mean fucking shit.

05:49.125 --> 05:50.392
I get that.

05:50.425 --> 05:51.792
I get that.

05:51.826 --> 05:56.392
I just need you to just come
with me, okay?

05:56.425 --> 05:58.425
Please.

06:00.492 --> 06:03.058
Give me my phone.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.559
Then I'm not
going anywhere.

06:11.759 --> 06:14.759
Fuck!

06:31.826 --> 06:33.759
I need you
to look at these.

06:42.325 --> 06:44.559
Please.

06:44.592 --> 06:46.726
Look.

07:29.359 --> 07:31.225
This is Charlotte, right?

07:33.826 --> 07:36.025
I remember her.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.092
You're the dad?

07:47.392 --> 07:49.392
Now I need you

07:51.092 --> 07:53.092
keep that man alive.

08:07.526 --> 08:08.492
I sort him out,

08:08.526 --> 08:11.092
you take him outta this
house, you understand?

08:11.125 --> 08:13.826
I don't care what other
shit you do with him,

08:13.859 --> 08:15.792
I just want you both gone.

08:19.158 --> 08:20.659
You know a response to any
of this would be greatly

08:20.692 --> 08:23.392
fucking appreciated?

08:35.292 --> 08:37.259
Hey?

08:39.592 --> 08:41.792
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry,
I finished later than I thought.

08:41.826 --> 08:43.792
I need you to just keep
him a little bit longer tonight

08:43.826 --> 08:46.626
if that's okay?

08:46.659 --> 08:49.459
Might have to be for the
whole night if you can?

08:49.492 --> 08:52.459
Yeah, I know what night it is.

08:52.492 --> 08:55.459
Crap, yeah, put him on.

08:55.492 --> 08:56.459
Hey, buddy!

08:56.492 --> 08:58.158
I've been waiting, you're late!

08:58.192 --> 08:59.659
Yeah, I know.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.292
Uh listen,
Nana's gonna take you

09:02.325 --> 09:03.292
trick or treating
tonight, okay?

09:06.192 --> 09:07.759
Yeah, I'm still here.

09:09.192 --> 09:12.158
Uh no,
I didn't get the costume,

09:12.192 --> 09:13.759
I was feeling pretty sick,
hon.

09:13.792 --> 09:16.259
Yeah, I know I did.

09:16.292 --> 09:18.158
Okay, hon, you know, I can't
really talk right now, okay.

09:18.192 --> 09:19.225
Um...

09:20.692 --> 09:22.726
Hey, what!

09:22.759 --> 09:25.726
No, she said that at school?

09:25.759 --> 09:28.292
Do what she says.

09:29.225 --> 09:32.359
Yeah, no,
that's pretty crazy, it is.

09:35.192 --> 09:36.158
Uh-huh.

09:36.192 --> 09:37.559
Okay, hon, hey.

09:37.592 --> 09:39.225
You know, I can't
really talk now, okay?

09:39.259 --> 09:41.626
Um, nothing.

09:41.659 --> 09:44.559
I'm going to uh, pick
you up in the morning

09:44.592 --> 09:47.592
and we're gonna eat all the
candy for breakfast, okay?

09:50.192 --> 09:52.526
You know, I love you.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.559
Goodbye!

10:16.559 --> 10:19.125
I'm Chris.

10:22.325 --> 10:24.325
Fuck you.

10:36.392 --> 10:38.359
I know him.

10:38.392 --> 10:40.759
His name is Alan.

10:45.526 --> 10:48.526
He raped your daughter?

10:59.158 --> 11:00.158
Fuck.

11:00.192 --> 11:02.192
Grab me my kit.

11:23.158 --> 11:26.292
The ratio of milk to cereal
in your sister's bowl

11:26.325 --> 11:28.692
is bordering on absurdity.

11:28.726 --> 11:31.125
What's the solution?

11:31.158 --> 11:33.225
Let her keep eating?

11:33.259 --> 11:35.125
Mmhmm.

11:35.158 --> 11:37.726
I gotta work late, so Francis
is gonna pick you guys up,

11:37.759 --> 11:39.792
take you guys out.

11:39.826 --> 11:40.325
Alright?

11:40.359 --> 11:41.659
Save me the suckers.

11:41.692 --> 11:42.692
Love your face.

11:42.726 --> 11:44.559
Love you, too.

12:00.559 --> 12:01.759
What is this?

12:01.792 --> 12:04.792
I can't have this near
the fucking house?

12:09.859 --> 12:11.759
Office.

13:23.659 --> 13:26.492
It's just kids.

13:26.526 --> 13:28.425
What?

13:28.459 --> 13:31.225
It's Halloween.

13:31.259 --> 13:34.225
You don't have
to stay here for this.

13:34.259 --> 13:36.626
You can just go.

13:36.659 --> 13:39.526
Yeah,
I think it's a little late for that.

13:39.559 --> 13:42.526
I'm invested now.

13:42.559 --> 13:45.526
Besides, this is my house.

15:03.459 --> 15:06.826
So how old's your son?

15:06.859 --> 15:09.058
7.

15:41.092 --> 15:44.092
So you've got him tied to
a chair in my kitchen.

15:46.492 --> 15:49.359
You took this to trial.

15:49.392 --> 15:52.392
He walked.

15:53.559 --> 15:55.826
You said you were a witness?

15:55.859 --> 15:59.058
I didn't actually see anything.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.492
You said he did it?

16:03.492 --> 16:05.125
He did.

16:05.158 --> 16:07.092
Based on what?

16:11.659 --> 16:13.225
Fuck me.

16:13.259 --> 16:14.626
I didn't pull this off

16:14.659 --> 16:17.359
without some sense of
fucking certainty.

16:17.392 --> 16:18.158
Prove it.

16:18.192 --> 16:21.092
It was a fingerprint
in my house.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.225
His.

16:22.259 --> 16:24.058
And his people kept trying
to threaten me every time

16:24.092 --> 16:25.025
I tried to press charges.

16:25.058 --> 16:28.158
And he had a car that was...
that was parked

16:28.192 --> 16:30.559
two blocks away from my
house on the same night.

16:30.592 --> 16:33.626
And my wife... my wife worked for
him,

16:33.659 --> 16:36.325
and so he knew about us.

16:36.359 --> 16:37.792
He knew my daughter.

16:37.826 --> 16:40.526
It's like he stood there
in front of a prosecutor

16:40.559 --> 16:42.626
with a fucking smoking gun

16:42.659 --> 16:45.726
and... and nobody could see
it except for me.

16:45.759 --> 16:47.259
And you haven't
heard the stories.

16:47.292 --> 16:48.526
About him raping kids?

16:48.559 --> 16:49.692
I'm pretty sure
I'd remember that.

16:49.726 --> 16:52.526
Let me tell you something,
this guy's shit list is so...

16:52.559 --> 16:53.726
You know, everybody has shit!

16:53.759 --> 16:55.759
It doesn't make it
necessarily true.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.259
You're gonna take his side?

16:57.292 --> 17:00.292
You beat a guy half to death!

17:01.092 --> 17:02.792
Broke into my house,
made me lie to my kid!

17:02.826 --> 17:06.025
Tied up my fucking
landlord in my kitchen.

17:07.157 --> 17:09.592
And you could've
called the cops.

18:01.592 --> 18:02.592
Okay!

18:02.626 --> 18:05.092
That's enough,
that's enough!

18:07.392 --> 18:09.125
Shit.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.325
Oh shit.

18:14.359 --> 18:15.459
Okay, head forwards,
head forwards, head forwards.

18:21.492 --> 18:23.092
Can you breathe?

18:26.125 --> 18:28.826
Can I call my kids please?

18:28.859 --> 18:30.559
I gotta reset your nose
and I need you

18:30.592 --> 18:32.626
to just take a couple
of deep breaths.

18:32.659 --> 18:34.125
If I don't do it now,
it's gonna...

18:34.158 --> 18:35.626
No, please. Just stop, stop!
Please stop!

18:40.092 --> 18:41.759
Look, I uh, I don't know

18:41.792 --> 18:43.292
what he has told you.

18:43.325 --> 18:45.092
But you are only getting
one side of a very

18:45.125 --> 18:48.058
complicated story told to you by
a very sick individual...

18:48.092 --> 18:48.826
Oh, I'm fucking sick!

18:48.859 --> 18:49.492
Huh?

18:49.526 --> 18:52.259
- Enough!
- I'm fucking sick!

18:52.292 --> 18:52.792
Stop!

18:52.826 --> 18:55.092
Don't!

18:55.125 --> 18:56.592
No!

19:15.392 --> 19:18.092
I need a bathroom.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.826
So do it.

19:34.692 --> 19:36.592
What?

19:36.626 --> 19:39.225
What now?

19:39.259 --> 19:41.459
You speak, you get bathroom
privileges?

19:41.492 --> 19:42.492
I've got nothing to say.

19:42.526 --> 19:44.526
Fuck you!

19:44.559 --> 19:45.759
Fuck you.

19:45.792 --> 19:47.792
No.

19:49.559 --> 19:51.125
Just relax.

19:51.158 --> 19:53.259
Do you or do you not have
something to do with...

19:53.292 --> 19:54.526
Don't get her involved.

19:54.559 --> 19:55.826
I can speak for myself.

19:55.859 --> 19:56.726
It's her place, her kitchen.

19:56.759 --> 19:59.192
It's your property,
you piece of shit.

19:59.225 --> 20:01.592
Well, then why is she here?

20:04.225 --> 20:06.158
What do you want?

20:07.259 --> 20:09.259
Fucking want?

20:10.726 --> 20:13.025
Confession.

20:16.425 --> 20:20.125
Can I call my kids?

20:20.158 --> 20:22.192
No, I uh...

20:24.559 --> 20:26.225
I won't...
I won't say anything.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.726
You can put a knife to
my throat or whatever it is

20:28.759 --> 20:31.559
you feel like,
that you need to do.

20:38.259 --> 20:40.692
I need you to read this.

20:40.726 --> 20:42.058
I need you to read this.

20:42.092 --> 20:43.325
What is that?

20:43.359 --> 20:45.125
Read it.

20:48.392 --> 20:50.292
Please just read.

20:53.425 --> 20:55.158
Out loud.

21:03.325 --> 21:05.826
"My daughter's room was just
above the living room."

21:45.092 --> 21:46.726
Charlotte?

21:57.359 --> 21:59.259
Charlotte!

22:01.692 --> 22:04.259
Charlotte!

22:07.192 --> 22:09.225
Charlotte!

22:11.425 --> 22:12.626
Okay, you know what?

22:12.659 --> 22:13.526
No.

22:13.559 --> 22:15.292
Just keep...
Please just keep reading.

22:15.325 --> 22:16.125
Please.

22:16.158 --> 22:17.826
This kitchen is not
a courthouse,

22:17.859 --> 22:19.659
I am not a clerk.

22:19.692 --> 22:22.459
Look, I think if you want
this to be said out loud,

22:22.492 --> 22:24.359
then perhaps you should
say it.

22:31.425 --> 22:34.125
I can't.

22:44.859 --> 22:47.058
"Took me a minute,

22:50.492 --> 22:53.225
I uh, then
I heard another scream."

23:31.459 --> 23:33.292
"I...

23:33.325 --> 23:35.626
then I heard another scream."

23:37.125 --> 23:39.392
Sorry, "I found her at the park

23:39.425 --> 23:41.626
in one of those coloured
tubes.

23:42.526 --> 23:45.659
She was shaking and she
won't even look at me.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.459
I pick her up.

23:47.492 --> 23:50.058
I can feel her shaking

23:50.092 --> 23:52.158
and there...

23:52.192 --> 23:54.359
was blood on my hands from
holding her.

23:56.158 --> 23:58.325
Her pants are torn down
the middle.

23:58.359 --> 24:00.192
The doctor said that
she had tears and had been..."

24:00.225 --> 24:02.459
Stop.

24:02.492 --> 24:06.659
Your car was parked
two blocks down from my house.

24:08.392 --> 24:09.792
What car?

24:09.826 --> 24:12.259
Make, model, year.

24:13.659 --> 24:16.325
My story has not
changed, okay?

24:16.359 --> 24:19.325
I stand by it and
so did a prosecutor.

24:20.359 --> 24:23.092
Huh.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.425
Yeah, nice guy,
Alan, right?

24:24.459 --> 24:26.192
Nice guy.

24:26.225 --> 24:27.559
Man of the people,
man of the city,

24:27.592 --> 24:29.325
but you just remember one thing?

24:29.359 --> 24:31.292
Your shit-list runs as
high as anybody else's...

24:31.325 --> 24:33.225
Okay,
Chris is this what you want?

24:33.259 --> 24:35.359
Are you gonna pull
a gun on me now or what?

24:35.392 --> 24:36.359
What is this?

24:36.392 --> 24:37.692
You just say the
word, fuck stick,

24:37.726 --> 24:38.526
because I've got one outside.

24:38.559 --> 24:39.959
Enough already.

24:39.993 --> 24:42.092
And I'll fucking put a bullet
right between your fucking eyes.

24:42.125 --> 24:43.092
This is... Jesus Christ, Chris.

24:43.125 --> 24:45.359
I've been unfaithful.

24:45.392 --> 24:47.559
I've engaged in lewd and
questionable behaviour

24:47.592 --> 24:48.759
around others.

24:48.792 --> 24:51.092
But I didn't run
from it, I fought it.

24:51.125 --> 24:51.993
And this?

24:52.025 --> 24:53.792
This is affordable
housing for people.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.259
I mean, surely she can attest to
this, pipe in if you'd like?

24:56.292 --> 24:58.292
This is nothing to do with this.
This is just you and me.

24:58.325 --> 24:59.492
I'm not getting between
the middle of you,

24:59.526 --> 25:00.459
this is between the two
of you...

25:00.492 --> 25:01.425
It's your narrative,
you've gotta understand.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.058
- You're dragging this off base.
- What base?

25:04.092 --> 25:05.792
I don't even know what grounds
you're trying to stand on?

25:05.826 --> 25:07.826
Truth!

25:07.859 --> 25:10.826
Truth!

25:10.859 --> 25:13.158
You've got me tied
to a chair.

25:15.125 --> 25:18.392
Now something terrible
happened to your daughter,

25:18.425 --> 25:20.259
without question.

25:20.292 --> 25:22.826
A parked car on a street
does not thus equal

25:22.859 --> 25:25.425
condemnation as a rapist
of children.

25:25.459 --> 25:27.826
Which as a father of two,
goes against every moral fibre

25:27.859 --> 25:29.659
of my being.

25:29.692 --> 25:32.526
So fuck you
and your accusations.

25:32.559 --> 25:34.559
You know, that I own
multiple properties in this city

25:34.592 --> 25:36.325
and one of them
happens to sit in

25:36.359 --> 25:38.826
the subdivision where you
were living at the time.

25:38.859 --> 25:40.425
This has all been
carefully broken down,

25:40.459 --> 25:44.392
my time as been more
than accounted for.

25:44.425 --> 25:46.192
You were in my house.

25:46.225 --> 25:48.359
I was never there.

25:48.392 --> 25:49.225
Yes, you were.

25:49.259 --> 25:51.726
I never set foot
in that fucking house.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.359
You know, I have proof.

25:54.392 --> 25:55.692
Yeah, a finger print, right?

25:55.726 --> 25:56.692
And that it was mine?

25:56.726 --> 25:58.425
Fine, I don't deny that.

25:58.459 --> 26:01.526
But what I do deny and
will continue to deny is

26:01.559 --> 26:04.192
that I was the one
who planted it there.

26:04.726 --> 26:05.826
Specifically
and coincidentally,

26:05.859 --> 26:09.726
in your upstairs
fucking hallway.

26:09.759 --> 26:11.626
Told her about
any of this?

26:15.192 --> 26:17.192
What?

26:19.359 --> 26:21.726
That I was sleeping
with his wife.

26:24.492 --> 26:26.659
She told you, she did.

26:26.692 --> 26:29.158
She confessed it in front
of a wolf pack of lawyers

26:29.192 --> 26:30.692
and my wife.

26:34.325 --> 26:37.392
I didn't do what you think
I did?

26:37.425 --> 26:38.726
I never said anything.

26:38.759 --> 26:42.459
No, I know what you fucking
think I did!

26:42.492 --> 26:44.058
I know!

26:44.092 --> 26:47.158
Stop.

26:47.192 --> 26:48.726
He wants to say it,
he wants to fucking say it.

26:48.759 --> 26:50.425
Chris.

26:50.459 --> 26:52.392
Look at his eyes.

26:52.425 --> 26:53.726
- Look at his fucking eyes.
- Chris?

26:53.759 --> 26:56.092
Can you stop?

26:56.125 --> 26:58.058
Just fucking look at his eyes
and you fucking tell...

26:58.092 --> 26:58.993
No!

26:59.025 --> 27:00.626
Listen to me,
I need you to look at me.

27:00.659 --> 27:02.325
I need you to fucking look
at his eyes!

27:02.359 --> 27:03.225
Chris!

27:03.259 --> 27:05.826
This is not going anywhere.

27:05.859 --> 27:07.492
You think I did it, huh?

27:07.526 --> 27:08.792
Just fucking say it.
You can fucking tell me?

27:08.826 --> 27:10.325
I did not say that.

27:13.359 --> 27:16.559
I wanted to fucking crucify you,
you and my wife.

27:17.792 --> 27:20.058
I wanted to fucking
crucify you both.

27:20.092 --> 27:23.759
I would never, I would never
fucking touch my little girl.

27:24.459 --> 27:26.759
Nobody is saying that you did.

27:29.292 --> 27:32.292
I didn't rape my kid!

27:34.259 --> 27:36.526
Neither did I.

27:36.559 --> 27:38.425
No, no!

27:40.692 --> 27:42.692
Move.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.125
I will go through you.

27:50.225 --> 27:52.526
You're gonna have to.

28:17.225 --> 28:19.325
Why are you a part of this?

28:21.092 --> 28:23.359
- Is it because of the...
- Just...

28:24.825 --> 28:28.192
Shut up.

28:30.392 --> 28:31.292
You know there's a number,

28:31.325 --> 28:34.792
uh you don't have to call,
you just text.

28:34.826 --> 28:37.292
And they'll send somebody
to take care of this.

29:12.325 --> 29:15.292
Hand me the phone?

29:15.325 --> 29:16.459
Hey?

29:16.492 --> 29:18.492
Hand me the phone.

29:40.826 --> 29:43.092
I'm not your subject.

29:43.125 --> 29:46.225
You can't come here into
my home and use me for

29:46.259 --> 29:48.559
whatever bullshit it is
that you're doing here.

29:48.592 --> 29:50.325
Okay, I'm sorry for what
happened to your daughter,

29:50.359 --> 29:52.292
I really am.

29:52.325 --> 29:55.392
But I was her fucking
nurse and nothing more.

29:58.092 --> 30:01.092
Okay, you know,
I had something happen to me.

30:01.759 --> 30:03.626
I played it out so many
times in my head that

30:03.659 --> 30:05.225
I'm not even sure if that's
exactly what fucking

30:05.259 --> 30:06.225
happened anymore.

30:06.259 --> 30:07.626
But it's been six months
for me and it's already

30:07.659 --> 30:08.726
twisted into something
else up here.

30:08.759 --> 30:10.192
It's been, what?

30:10.225 --> 30:12.459
Five years for you, Chris?

30:12.492 --> 30:14.092
Maybe you should start
thinking about things

30:14.125 --> 30:15.792
a little differently.

31:38.425 --> 31:40.659
Thanks very much.

31:51.225 --> 31:52.392
Who is this?

31:57.092 --> 31:58.125
I know.

31:58.158 --> 31:59.592
Know what?

31:59.626 --> 32:02.626
I know you know him.

32:03.659 --> 32:05.692
Uh yeah,
I told you that I did.

32:05.726 --> 32:07.158
So?

32:07.192 --> 32:10.726
He's my fucking landlord
and nothing more.

32:10.759 --> 32:12.425
Okay?
That's your big conspiracy.

32:12.459 --> 32:14.292
Once or twice a year he leaves
a fancy car of his

32:14.325 --> 32:16.192
in my shed for the season
and that is it.

32:16.225 --> 32:18.392
Not that any of this
is your fucking business!

32:19.392 --> 32:22.359
Fuck you.

32:22.392 --> 32:25.325
You hear me, fuck you.

32:25.359 --> 32:27.192
I don't want you in this
house anymore.

32:27.225 --> 32:28.425
I don't want you here.

32:56.259 --> 32:58.225
I've got someone on the way.

33:07.259 --> 33:10.125
Did you do it?

33:41.726 --> 33:44.692
Uh, uh,
uh I didn't uh...

33:44.726 --> 33:47.692
I didn't do
what he said I did.

33:49.826 --> 33:50.792
Okay?

34:11.626 --> 34:12.559
Move.

34:57.225 --> 35:00.359
Don't go.

35:27.092 --> 35:28.826
Just say it.

35:28.859 --> 35:33.092
I don't...
I don't know what you want me to say?

35:40.792 --> 35:43.492
You raped my daughter.

35:51.259 --> 35:52.392
Oh shit!

35:52.425 --> 35:53.759
You fucked her.

35:58.125 --> 35:59.559
Ah Jesus!

36:01.792 --> 36:03.459
Chris.

36:11.358 --> 36:13.125
No!

36:13.158 --> 36:15.526
Oh!

36:20.526 --> 36:22.526
You went into her room.

36:29.592 --> 36:31.158
You grabbed her.

36:36.692 --> 36:39.392
And I shoulda been there

36:39.425 --> 36:42.659
to protect her from you.

36:42.692 --> 36:45.359
You sick fuck!

36:53.092 --> 36:55.492
Just

36:55.526 --> 36:57.392
Say it.

36:58.492 --> 37:01.092
Say it, fucking say it.

37:01.125 --> 37:02.826
Fucking say.

37:02.859 --> 37:04.292
Stop it, Chris.

37:04.325 --> 37:05.659
Stop it.

37:05.692 --> 37:07.659
Please stop, please
stop, please.

37:07.692 --> 37:09.425
Please stop, please stop.

37:09.459 --> 37:13.392
Look, stop I didn't,
I didn't touch your...

37:13.425 --> 37:14.692
I did not touch your daughter.

37:14.726 --> 37:16.325
I did not touch
your daughter.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.325
Okay?

37:17.359 --> 37:19.158
Please, I have two
daughters of my own and I

37:19.192 --> 37:21.492
just wanna see them again
please, just stop it

37:21.526 --> 37:24.192
please, just stop it,
Chris, please just stop it.

37:24.225 --> 37:27.092
Stop it please.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.592
No, you just

38:19.359 --> 38:22.158
I know you
fucking did it.

40:19.392 --> 40:21.325
It's okay.

40:21.359 --> 40:24.225
It's for me.

41:22.526 --> 41:23.626
Go, go!

41:23.659 --> 41:24.726
Get her!

41:35.659 --> 41:36.692
Roll over!

41:36.726 --> 41:38.559
Yeah, get her!

41:44.359 --> 41:46.359
Get her hands!

41:49.259 --> 41:52.259
Get her feet!

41:58.259 --> 42:00.058
Yeah.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.826
Let's go.

42:10.859 --> 42:12.292
Fuck it.

42:16.425 --> 42:17.592
Who are you?

42:17.626 --> 42:19.526
Huh?

42:22.592 --> 42:24.225
What the fuck?

42:24.259 --> 42:26.292
Get his hands.

43:03.826 --> 43:06.626
Let's get her up.

43:07.626 --> 43:09.292
No, please, listen to me.

43:09.325 --> 43:10.526
You don't have to do this.

43:10.559 --> 43:12.259
I have nothing, this has
nothing to do with me.

43:12.292 --> 43:13.425
Come on!

43:13.459 --> 43:14.559
Get up!

43:14.592 --> 43:16.459
I think,
you don't have to do...

43:16.492 --> 43:17.459
Take her upstairs.

43:17.492 --> 43:18.259
Come on!

43:18.292 --> 43:19.259
Please!

43:19.292 --> 43:20.592
Please, this has nothing
to...

43:23.459 --> 43:24.626
Fuck sakes!

43:24.659 --> 43:26.225
Holy fuck.

43:26.259 --> 43:28.158
Alright.

43:28.192 --> 43:29.592
No!

43:29.626 --> 43:31.626
No, no!

43:36.359 --> 43:38.058
No!

43:41.459 --> 43:43.392
Alright, get him too.

43:46.325 --> 43:49.158
Alright, here we go.

44:56.626 --> 44:59.592
You okay?

44:59.626 --> 45:01.325
This piece of shit.

45:01.359 --> 45:03.392
Motherfucker piece of...

45:06.425 --> 45:08.225
Oh.

46:23.626 --> 46:26.325
You son of a bitch!

46:26.359 --> 46:27.492
Oh fucker!

48:21.726 --> 48:23.726
What is this?

48:26.225 --> 48:28.425
This is not me.

50:08.158 --> 50:09.492
They're not gonna let us leave.

50:17.659 --> 50:19.325
Ouch!

50:19.359 --> 50:20.592
Just stop!

50:20.626 --> 50:21.659
Hey!

50:21.692 --> 50:23.392
I don't... listen!

50:23.425 --> 50:26.259
I don't know what
to do right now.

50:26.292 --> 50:28.559
But something is happening
that is completely

50:28.592 --> 50:30.659
out of our control.

50:37.759 --> 50:40.759
Now, I can't do
this by myself.

50:42.158 --> 50:43.726
Okay?

55:05.759 --> 55:08.225
Alright bitch,
fucking come and get it.

55:09.792 --> 55:11.492
Get the fuck off me!

55:11.526 --> 55:14.092
Get the fuck...

55:15.792 --> 55:18.092
Fuck!

55:18.125 --> 55:20.292
Fuck!

55:37.225 --> 55:40.092
Oh my God!

56:05.692 --> 56:07.459
Oh, oh my God!

56:55.726 --> 56:58.359
Bitch!

57:50.792 --> 57:53.759
Oh.

57:53.792 --> 57:54.526
Shit.

57:54.559 --> 57:57.559
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

57:57.592 --> 58:00.526
Easy.

58:00.559 --> 58:01.659
Fuck.

58:01.692 --> 58:02.526
Yeah, yeah.

58:02.559 --> 58:04.659
Alright.

58:04.692 --> 58:06.492
Yeah.

58:06.526 --> 58:08.692
Take it easy.

58:08.726 --> 58:10.792
Nice and slow.

58:13.826 --> 58:15.792
Jesus Christ.

58:15.826 --> 58:17.626
What the fuck is this?

58:21.492 --> 58:23.492
She's got a fucking gun.

58:27.459 --> 58:30.425
Alright, everybody,
stay fucking calm.

58:33.826 --> 58:35.325
Be cool.

58:35.359 --> 58:38.125
Huh?

58:38.158 --> 58:39.659
No, let him go.

58:39.692 --> 58:42.092
Can't do that.

58:43.325 --> 58:44.158
You let him go!

58:44.192 --> 58:45.259
Jesus, fuck!

58:45.292 --> 58:46.359
Run.

58:46.392 --> 58:47.392
Someone fucking get her.

58:47.425 --> 58:49.392
Romina, run.

58:49.425 --> 58:51.259
Can someone
fucking grab this whore?

58:51.292 --> 58:52.259
Run!

58:52.292 --> 58:54.025
Fucking Jesus!

58:56.692 --> 58:58.325
I'm sorry.

59:04.125 --> 59:05.058
Get her!

59:47.259 --> 59:48.826
Get that son of a bitch!

01:02:08.592 --> 01:02:11.425
No, no, no, no!

01:04:25.158 --> 01:04:28.125
Please, please,

01:04:28.158 --> 01:04:31.158
please I just wanna call
my kids, please?

01:04:38.359 --> 01:04:40.726
What do you want?

01:04:42.859 --> 01:04:45.425
I want it all.

01:04:52.392 --> 01:04:55.392
Chris.

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:59.425
Chris?

01:05:01.726 --> 01:05:03.726
Chris!

01:06:09.459 --> 01:06:10.492
Him.

01:06:16.125 --> 01:06:17.325
He did it.

01:06:24.826 --> 01:06:26.726
He did it.

01:08:37.792 --> 01:08:38.526
No.

01:08:38.559 --> 01:08:39.492
No.

01:08:39.526 --> 01:08:41.792
No, no, no!

01:10:19.859 --> 01:10:23.058
I'm sorry, Chris.

01:14:04.225 --> 01:14:06.626
Oh God.

01:14:26.626 --> 01:14:29.359
Trick or treat?

01:14:41.492 --> 01:14:43.259
Thank you.

01:14:43.292 --> 01:14:45.659
Happy Halloween!
