00:13.381 --> 00:15.215
Let's try something different.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.219
That look in your
eyes is scaring me.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.554
I got two words for you.

00:20.588 --> 00:21.755
Yeah?

00:21.789 --> 00:23.557
Handcuffs.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.793
That's just one word.

00:55.523 --> 00:56.657
The key fell in the grate.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.592
I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.428
No, that doesn't matter.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.029
It's not about that.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.196
Then what is it about?

01:03.230 --> 01:04.831
It's about you.

Someone once said,

02:25.613 --> 02:27.681
"It's better to
have loved and lost

02:27.715 --> 02:29.783
"than not to
have loved at all."

02:29.817 --> 02:32.720
I wanna punch
that guy in the face.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.522
It's a pretty trippy thing

02:34.555 --> 02:35.923
when your girlfriend
breaks up with you

02:35.956 --> 02:38.926
when she's naked
and handcuffed to a bed.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.429
It's something that
really makes you think.

02:41.462 --> 02:45.833
And the thing I kept
thinking about was, "Why?"

02:45.866 --> 02:49.236
Not, "Why did she
break up with me?"

02:49.269 --> 02:52.840
But, "Why do I get in relationships
in the first place?"

02:52.873 --> 02:56.309
A year later, I was still
asking the same question.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.711
And then I met Sunny.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.615
You think dogs are
smarter than people?

03:01.649 --> 03:03.784
I think
I like them more.

03:03.817 --> 03:07.888
We run around trying to pay
our rent, stressed out about

03:07.921 --> 03:11.659
the price of gas,
pussy and cars.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.193
Not necessarily in that order.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.828
Right.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.064
Meanwhile, look at Herman.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.366
Look at your boy.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.368
Just licking the mess out
of his own dick. Yeah.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.704
If he's not smarter, he's
definitely more flexible.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.474
I mean,
look at the way these dogs

03:26.507 --> 03:28.576
interact with each other.
No bullshit.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.843
Look at these two.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.679
"Well, hello."

03:31.712 --> 03:33.013
"Oh, hi."

03:33.046 --> 03:34.247
"I'm gonna fuck you."

03:34.281 --> 03:37.084
"I expect nothing less.
What do you think?"

03:37.117 --> 03:38.519
"It's a little gamey."

03:38.552 --> 03:40.888
"Well, that's just rude,
isn't it?"

03:40.921 --> 03:43.857
"Who am I kidding?
Tell me how good I am."

03:45.258 --> 03:47.294
"I'm done. Bye."

03:47.327 --> 03:48.729
"Bye."

03:50.330 --> 03:52.633
Holy shit.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.067
Look at that.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.970
Hi.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.472
All right.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.041
Taking into account
the fact that

04:01.074 --> 04:02.910
you're desperate
and super pathetic,

04:02.943 --> 04:04.878
I'm gonna give you exactly
five seconds to make a move

04:04.912 --> 04:07.581
before I take over this
operation and make it my own.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.850
Sweet, sweet thing.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.285
Yes. Hi, you sweet thing.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.421
You are so cute.

04:14.454 --> 04:16.824
You're so cute.

04:16.857 --> 04:20.793
One, one thousand.
Two Mississippi.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.863
Three and four and...
All right. Okay.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.967
What do I do?
Use the dog.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.135
Hi.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.537
Hi there, sweetie.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.606
Hi. Hi.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.374
Yeah.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.543
Is he yours?

04:35.576 --> 04:37.344
Yeah, he's mine.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.880
This one and, uh,
the one over there,

04:39.913 --> 04:42.182
treating his body
like a candy store.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.051
That's Herman.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.187
And, uh, what's this one's name?

04:47.220 --> 04:48.889
This one is named Grandma.

04:48.922 --> 04:49.923
Grandma?

04:51.324 --> 04:52.593
Grandma has balls.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.095
Yeah, yeah, I know,
Grandma has balls.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.965
No, I just, uh, I like the name.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.067
I thought it'd be funny
to say things like,

05:00.100 --> 05:02.102
"Grandma shit on
the floor again,"

05:02.135 --> 05:05.172
or "I put Grandma
in his cage again."

05:05.205 --> 05:07.941
So, what does that
make you, great grandpa?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.477
That's me, great grandpa.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.246
No, I'm, uh, Sydney. Hi.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.415
Sunny. Hi, Sunny.
Nice to meet you.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.884
Nice to meet you.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.086
I'm sure that you have
some kind of absolute rule

05:19.119 --> 05:21.789
that you never break that
when you're, you know, hiking

05:21.822 --> 05:25.626
or without your friends, or when
you're wearing shorts or something,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.728
that no matter what,
under any circumstance,

05:27.761 --> 05:30.798
you don't give out
your phone number,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.933
but I think you should
give me your phone number,

05:32.966 --> 05:35.502
and I think you should
let me take you out.

05:35.535 --> 05:36.970
Really?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.806
I do.
And why is that?

05:38.839 --> 05:43.110
Because I'm a nice guy,

05:43.143 --> 05:46.079
and because I have a
nice physique, you know.

05:46.113 --> 05:49.216
I eat right, and I have a
strict calisthenic routine,

05:50.951 --> 05:56.790
and I promise to take you out on a
really nice old-fashioned date.

05:56.824 --> 06:00.694
What do you say? Let me
take you out for a drink,

06:00.728 --> 06:04.097
and, uh, I'll try not
to say anything stupid?

06:04.131 --> 06:08.001
"Alcohol gives you infinite
patience for stupidity."

06:08.035 --> 06:10.638
Sammy Davis, Jr. said that.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.005
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.042
Okay, so you're available or...

06:15.075 --> 06:16.610
Yes.

06:18.178 --> 06:21.148
It's scary to
put yourself out there.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.785
We all remember when
we got our first scar

06:24.818 --> 06:27.988
the first time love burned us.

06:28.021 --> 06:33.794
For Roger, it was fifth grade,
Wednesday, lunch period.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.998
Meatloaf day.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.350
Growing up, Roger Waldman
was one of those kids

06:57.384 --> 07:00.620
that needed just a little more
attention than everyone else.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.957
Ironically,
it was at this moment,

07:03.991 --> 07:07.094
as he was seeking the love
and attention of his peers

07:07.127 --> 07:09.629
that love first found him.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.699
Roger, can I talk to you?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.501
Yeah.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.603
Megan Hernandez.

07:16.636 --> 07:19.172
Rumor had it
she was an epic slut.

07:21.508 --> 07:25.612
Roger. Roger, do you
know Cathy Kramer?

07:25.645 --> 07:28.215
He had no idea who she was.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.983
Uh, yeah.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.853
Well, she likes you.
Do you like her?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.654
He was 12.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.825
He got a hard-on
if he wore sweatpants.

07:37.858 --> 07:41.729
Yeah. Yeah, I really,
really like her a lot.

07:41.762 --> 07:45.365
Well, she wants you
to ask her out.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.900
Really?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.136
Okay.

07:49.169 --> 07:55.976
Uh, so, Cathy, do you
wanna go out with me?

07:58.111 --> 07:59.046
Okay.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.914
So she wasn't what he expected,

08:00.948 --> 08:03.116
but she was willing.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.886
And that was enough.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.390
Um, you wanna share my brownie?

08:10.423 --> 08:11.959
Okay.

08:15.328 --> 08:20.533
Do you want me to throw
your tray away for you?

08:23.436 --> 08:25.405
She was a real keeper.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.279
Roger?
Hey.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.150
Cathy doesn't wanna go out
with you anymore.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.586
She thinks you're
moving way too fast.

08:39.619 --> 08:43.924
Roger's first love didn't
even make it to recess.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.559
I shouldn't have
drunken all that!

08:52.699 --> 08:54.902
♪ I wanna be normal

08:56.369 --> 09:00.473
♪ I wanna do
normal people things

09:25.866 --> 09:27.600
Hey.
Hi.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.369
Come on in.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.704
I just need one more minute
to finish getting ready.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.306
Okie-dokie.
Okay.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.846
This is
a really nice house.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.815
You could live here,
and if you need extra cash,

09:41.849 --> 09:43.817
you could sell crack.

09:43.851 --> 09:46.353
I know it's a mess,
but I love it.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.455
You know, Henry Miller
used to live here.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.422
Is that true?

09:49.456 --> 09:52.059
Well, he bought it
for his girlfriend.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.361
At least, that's what
the landlord told me.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.463
Either way, it's super cheap.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.966
Is it free?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.468
How long
have you lived in L.A.?

10:01.501 --> 10:04.838
I moved here about eight
years ago from Pittsburgh.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.439
Oh, really?

10:06.473 --> 10:09.376
I'm from Philly.
Why did you leave the Burgh?

10:10.643 --> 10:12.112
Pittsburgh is
kind of like Newark

10:12.145 --> 10:14.047
without the cultural advantages.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.782
It's a Johnny Carson quote.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.219
What, did you buy a
quote book from, like, 1973?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.921
If you quote Vinnie Barbarino,

10:20.954 --> 10:22.890
I'm not taking you to dinner.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.158
No, I collect
stupid quotes.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.294
I have a whole journal
full of them.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.097
My grandpa used to do it,
and then, when he died,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.099
I just kind of
kept the thing going.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.469
For some reason, when my
grandfather died, he left me his toupee.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.605
I guess he was
really proud of it.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.007
It did look pretty good.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.443
Anyway, who did these paintings?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.045
I did.

10:46.679 --> 10:47.881
Wow.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.718
You look amazing.

10:51.751 --> 10:55.255
And I love your paintings,
they're really great.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.057
Thank you.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.226
Is that what you do,
you're a painter?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.328
Well, it's what I like to do.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.097
But, you know, I'm a bartender.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.999
I get it.
Yeah.

11:06.033 --> 11:11.038
I'm having a little trouble getting
somebody to show these in town.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.206
Confidence is
a bit low so, you know,

11:13.240 --> 11:16.409
I'm willing to take
all the compliments you got.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.713
Well, your hair looks very nice.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.616
I love the color yellow
in that painting over there.

11:23.650 --> 11:27.587
You're very tall, you have a
nice smile, very pleasant aroma.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.223
Your hygiene in general
seems way above average.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.724
Am I doing good?
Wow.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.760
Thank you. Yeah, that's great.
You want some more?

11:33.793 --> 11:36.463
Sure. Bring 'em. Okay. I'll tell
you on the way to dinner. Okay.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.865
Let me see what I can think of.
I like this date already.

11:38.898 --> 11:41.301
I like your dress.
I like your purse.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.570
Your attitude
needs some adjustment.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.208
So, do you do this often?

11:48.241 --> 11:50.277
I've never
been here before.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.379
My friend suggested it.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.981
He said he thought
it would be fun,

11:54.014 --> 11:55.983
but I'm beginning to think,
for a long time now,

11:56.016 --> 11:57.417
that he may be an idiot.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.154
So, you're not a gun guy?
You don't own a gun?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.956
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm too volatile.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.591
I'd probably
wind up shooting myself

12:04.624 --> 12:07.427
'cause I had a bad audition
for, like, a soap commercial.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.728
Jesus.

12:10.597 --> 12:14.001
Okay, this is like a psychotic
bowling alley, is how I see this.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.902
They're like,
"You're on lane seven,

12:15.935 --> 12:17.870
"here's a gun,
here's some bullets,

12:17.904 --> 12:20.540
"try not to shoot yourself in the
face, try not to shoot anyone else."

12:20.573 --> 12:22.409
I think we should go.
What do you think?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.844
No. We're here.
I wanna shoot guns.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.279
I wanna shoot guns, too.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.315
I wanna fire my sidearm at that

12:28.348 --> 12:30.050
fat Tom Selleck
over there. All right.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.457
Come on. You can do it.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.029
Nice shot.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.730
Yeah. I'm done.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.897
You're up.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.399
Okay.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.072
Let's see it, Sundance.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.646
That's amazing.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.049
You shot every single thing
out there except the target.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.384
You're a miracle!

13:04.417 --> 13:06.119
You know, what I love
about Los Angeles is that

13:06.153 --> 13:09.656
every single cliche you ever
heard about it is true.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.325
That is very true.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.562
Hello, it's Felipe.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.064
Pablo. Yeah.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.898
Where does
he even get his bill?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.745
So, um, did you always
want to be an actor?

13:32.779 --> 13:35.615
I wanted to be an actor
who did, like, good stuff

13:35.648 --> 13:38.051
like Pacino kind of stuff,
or like Shakespeare.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.621
Instead, I, uh, kind of became
like the Oscar Mayer wiener guy,

13:41.654 --> 13:43.256
stuff like that, you know?

13:43.290 --> 13:44.691
Can't be that bad, come on.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.293
Yeah, I do a lot of commercials.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.129
And, uh, I basically get paid

13:49.162 --> 13:51.264
to make a fool of myself,
you know.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.566
It's kind of brutal at points.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.735
Well, I completely understand

13:55.768 --> 13:58.438
because I cannot wait till I don't
have to serve drinks anymore,

13:58.471 --> 14:00.840
and can just paint
full time, you know?

14:00.873 --> 14:03.276
Yeah. I know
what you mean.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.378
Before I came to
pick you up tonight,

14:05.412 --> 14:07.547
I actually,
uh, wrote a short story.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.882
Okay. What was
the story about?

14:09.916 --> 14:11.818
The worst first date ever.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.123
And what happens on this date?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.857
The guy dies.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.460
Wow. So, I guess I'm really
lucky that I got dinner then.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.195
You are.
You're lucky you got dinner.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.198
So I'm paying,
is what you're telling me.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.733
Yes, I was gonna
tell you in a bit.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.501
Great. That's fantastic.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.306
What?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.308
How are you still single?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.445
I'm difficult.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.681
How long ago was
your last breakup?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.151
Almost a year. Yours?

14:44.184 --> 14:47.053
Exactly a year.

14:47.086 --> 14:50.022
Did you get your heart broken?

14:50.056 --> 14:53.326
Why don't we just skip that chat

14:53.360 --> 14:56.028
and assume we're both
slightly damaged goods?

14:56.062 --> 14:58.865
Broken heart's
a rite of passage.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.767
No one gets away scot-free.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.703
True that.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.539
The beginning of a
relationship is a game.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.676
We may not want to
play it, but we do.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.714
The one guy
who tried not to play,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.951
he got burned pretty bad.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.353
This is the story

15:20.387 --> 15:23.523
of Jean-Pierre
and Ms. Evelyn Zingerelli

15:23.556 --> 15:25.758
of Boca Raton, Florida.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.540
Everything was
perfect through dinner.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.776
The wine was sweet,
the prime rib was prime,

15:43.810 --> 15:46.646
and Jean-Pierre
a perfect gentleman.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.785
But when the early bird
special dessert arrived,

15:52.819 --> 15:54.621
things took a turn.

15:55.855 --> 16:01.361
Evelyn, I would like to ask you,

16:01.394 --> 16:03.796
do you believe
that men and women

16:03.830 --> 16:07.634
must always play games
with one another?

16:07.667 --> 16:13.906
Or can it be more honest
and true to our nature?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.977
I'm too old
to play games.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.779
Then I will go on.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.583
Evelyn,

16:23.616 --> 16:28.355
I wish to enjoy
the wonder of your body

16:29.356 --> 16:33.860
and let you explore mine.

16:33.893 --> 16:34.927
Jean...

16:34.961 --> 16:38.265
I took three Viagras
this afternoon.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.067
And now I am as hard

16:41.100 --> 16:43.703
as a stale Stromboli!

16:47.707 --> 16:50.343
We are animals.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.679
We want to fuck like animals.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.118
I wish to drink
your sweet nectar.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.153
I want your hands upon...

17:01.187 --> 17:03.390
Evelyn just sat there

17:03.423 --> 17:06.659
too stunned to speak,
too shocked to move.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.662
Jean-Pierre continued
with his disgusting imagery

17:09.695 --> 17:12.699
and his elaborate
sexual desires.

17:12.732 --> 17:13.733
And then...

17:18.771 --> 17:19.872
Oh!

17:23.310 --> 17:26.746
Jean-Pierre died of a
Viagra-induced heart attack,

17:26.779 --> 17:30.917
and Ms. Evelyn Zingerelli
was left to pay the bill.

17:34.454 --> 17:38.124
For her remaining years, Evelyn
was haunted by the date.

17:38.157 --> 17:42.995
But she could never ignore that little
voice that whispered, "Perhaps."

17:43.029 --> 17:45.698
Perhaps Jean-Pierre
had been right

17:45.732 --> 17:48.301
and this game between the sexes

17:48.335 --> 17:52.271
was a game that did
not need to be played.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.975
It's really, really funny.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.311
Seriously, thank you
so much for reading it.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.679
It means a lot to me.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.314
I'm just glad it didn't suck.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.149
I once went on
a date with this musician,

18:03.182 --> 18:05.985
this gorgeous, gorgeous musician.
He was built like a...

18:06.018 --> 18:08.355
I get it, he was nice-looking.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.689
Well, then he
played me his demo.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.223
Oh, boy.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.192
Any time I tried to say
anything, he would shush me

18:13.225 --> 18:16.796
'cause he really wanted me to vibe
out to his really shitty music.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.531
I remember,
when it was all over,

18:18.565 --> 18:20.867
I ended up looking at him
and I thought to myself,

18:20.900 --> 18:22.669
"I have never
been less attracted

18:22.702 --> 18:24.571
"to anyone
in my entire life."

18:24.604 --> 18:26.806
So, you're saying you're,
like, super attracted

18:26.839 --> 18:29.342
to me because I'm so talented?

18:31.310 --> 18:34.246
Well, let's just say that I'm willing
to go on another date with you,

18:34.280 --> 18:38.718
which is more than I can say
for the gorgeous musician.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.953
Who said I wanted to go
on another date with you?

18:42.121 --> 18:45.458
♪ Is it better to be
honest and be unknown?

18:45.492 --> 18:50.096
♪ Will we break from this

Reminds me

19:37.176 --> 19:40.447
That was his lover
of many, many years.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.814
Was a nice-looking lady.

19:41.848 --> 19:42.949
Hmm.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.152
You know, he used to say he knew

19:46.185 --> 19:48.120
he wasn't in love
with people anymore

19:48.154 --> 19:52.091
when they became more contorted
and ugly in his paintings.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.094
This must've been right,

19:55.127 --> 19:56.429
right at the end.

19:57.764 --> 20:02.301
His father was a painter.
Don Ruiz.

20:02.334 --> 20:07.273
He, uh, taught art in Malaga,
where Picasso grew up.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.509
He painted pigeons.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.745
When Picasso was 11,

20:12.779 --> 20:14.881
he was already a great artist.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.585
And his father's eyesight
was getting worse and worse.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.390
One day, he was
having trouble painting

20:24.423 --> 20:27.426
the tiny little feet
on the pigeons,

20:27.460 --> 20:29.962
and before he left to go
teach his class that day,

20:29.996 --> 20:32.965
he asked his
11-year-old son, Pablo,

20:32.999 --> 20:36.503
if he could help him
with the pigeons' feet.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.305
He went off, taught his class,

20:39.338 --> 20:42.642
and when Don Ruiz got home,

20:42.675 --> 20:45.512
he saw what his son had done.

20:45.545 --> 20:49.682
And it was so magnificent,

20:49.716 --> 20:52.519
so beautiful that

20:52.552 --> 20:55.221
he quit painting forever.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.758
Is that true?

20:59.158 --> 21:00.459
Mmm-hmm.

21:01.894 --> 21:05.932
I bet you have
a killer quote by Picasso.

21:08.868 --> 21:12.772
"It took me four years
to paint like Raphael,

21:12.805 --> 21:16.208
"but it took me a lifetime
to paint like a child."

21:30.022 --> 21:32.792
This little piggy
went to Las Vegas

21:32.825 --> 21:35.127
and won $3,000 on a nickel slot,

21:35.161 --> 21:37.864
but then lost it all in an
awkward sexual encounter

21:37.897 --> 21:39.666
with an overweight prostitute.

21:39.699 --> 21:45.437
This piggy developed adult
chickenpox and got very, very sick.

21:45.471 --> 21:48.708
This little piggy here

21:48.741 --> 21:52.378
drowned, but the police
do not suspect foul play.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.581
These little piggies
have really shitty luck.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.482
Yes, they do.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.350
But not this piggy.

21:58.384 --> 22:01.387
This one went wee-wee...

22:01.420 --> 22:03.222
Stop it!

22:03.255 --> 22:04.957
wee, all the way home.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.564
Okay. So tell me,

22:11.598 --> 22:14.533
what about this little piggy?

22:28.047 --> 22:30.482
All they say is they're
looking for character types.

22:30.516 --> 22:35.154
Which basically means, bring in
as many weirdos as you can find.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.756
If I'm still going on
commercial auditions

22:36.789 --> 22:40.059
when I'm 50,
you have to kill me.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.829
Thank you for coming.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.097
I just wanna see what the hell
it is you do at these things.

22:45.131 --> 22:49.401
Well, I go in there, and I dance
like a kind of meat puppet.

22:49.435 --> 22:53.505
They give me some embarrassing shit
to do, and I basically rape myself.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.774
Hey, Sydney.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.509
Jesus, Devin!
What happened, man?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.311
Ah, crushed it, man.

22:59.345 --> 23:01.648
Guess they'd never
seen anything like it.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.182
But, you know,
I've been so hot lately.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.184
You know, I just booked
this Pizza Hut national,

23:05.217 --> 23:07.086
and I got a couple
of Coke spots running,

23:07.119 --> 23:09.588
and I'm up for
a co-star on NCIS.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.557
I'm talking
about your neck, man.

23:11.590 --> 23:15.662
Oh, yeah, that. I got into a skiing
accident, broke a couple of bones.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.929
C2, C3.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.197
You okay?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.332
Yeah, man. Never been busier.
Work's been great.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.636
I actually gotta jet to the Valley
right now for a Taco Bell audish.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.705
Break a leg in there.

23:27.306 --> 23:29.108
What was that?

23:29.141 --> 23:31.077
This is my life.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.479
You wanted to see? It's dark. It's dark.
Jesus. It's dark.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.014
Sydney Greenbaum.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.082
Okay.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.150
Profiles, please.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.727
Great. So it's
Chevy Summer Sales event

23:47.760 --> 23:49.762
and you are Chevy's
new team mascot, okay?

23:49.796 --> 23:53.833
So, you're leading the team of
cars onto the field, all right?

23:53.866 --> 23:56.969
You're gonna charge through
this locker room here,

23:57.003 --> 23:59.138
you're gonna jump
through this hoop

23:59.171 --> 24:01.073
and then a team of cars
are gonna drive out

24:01.107 --> 24:02.308
into the field
after you, all right?

24:02.341 --> 24:05.111
Real simple. Got it?

24:05.144 --> 24:09.015
You actually want me
to jump through the hoop?

24:09.048 --> 24:10.616
Like a mascot.
You jump through the hoop,

24:10.649 --> 24:13.119
and then you jump
up and down. Cool?

24:13.152 --> 24:15.087
You want me to do
a tap dance, too?

24:15.121 --> 24:16.222
Sure, man, yeah.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.758
Make it your own.
Whatever you gotta do.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.093
Action!

24:24.797 --> 24:27.499
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

24:27.533 --> 24:28.901
Chevy!

24:28.935 --> 24:29.969
Cut!

24:30.737 --> 24:32.371
Good, good, real good.

24:32.404 --> 24:33.940
Uh, we'll do it again.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.775
A little more energy, okay?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.910
And what happened
to the tap dance?

24:44.751 --> 24:46.018
Look,
if I want your opinion,

24:46.052 --> 24:47.619
I'll tell it to you, all right?

24:48.955 --> 24:50.823
But I think that's why
my wife and I

24:50.857 --> 24:52.424
have such a great relationship.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.527
We have this agreement
to always fight fair.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.063
It's like a contract.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.697
They really do. They have
an excellent relationship.

24:58.731 --> 24:59.899
They know how to communicate.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.100
It's great seeing you, man.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.735
It's really nice
to see you, too.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.771
Yeah. So, what's the story

25:04.804 --> 25:06.272
with this, what's going on?

25:06.305 --> 25:08.174
We've been together
for three months now.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.042
Three months?
Okay. What do you do?

25:10.076 --> 25:12.278
I'm a painter.
I'm sorry?

25:12.311 --> 25:13.445
A painter.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.786
I'm sorry. Come on, that's
even worse than an actress.

25:19.819 --> 25:22.088
A painter and an actor.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.024
I hope you guys have
separate bank accounts,

25:25.057 --> 25:27.226
not that there'll
ever be anything in them.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.929
Listen, one bit of advice.
Slow it down.

25:29.962 --> 25:32.932
Enjoy this, right?
The courting?

25:32.965 --> 25:35.601
This whole thing, no reason
to rush into anything.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.003
You're young,
you think you know.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.105
Trust me, you don't know, right?

25:39.138 --> 25:41.407
I know.
I'm married 11 years.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.475
Yeah, 11 years.
It's unbelievable.

25:43.509 --> 25:44.777
I'm not saying
this isn't gonna work.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.212
It is unbelievable.

25:46.245 --> 25:49.148
This just might work.
But just take your time.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.516
Enjoy.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.551
Excuse me.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.353
You okay?

25:54.386 --> 25:55.687
I'll be right back. Yeah, I'm
just gonna run to the restroom.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.256
You sure?
Yeah.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.759
Bro.
Yo.

26:00.793 --> 26:01.894
You're killing me right now.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.262
What are you talking about?

26:03.295 --> 26:06.999
You either hear it
from me or from a judge.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.439
I know that my friend
was being an asshole.

26:13.472 --> 26:15.474
And I want you to be able
to feel how you wanna feel.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.177
I want you to be able
to say what you're thinking.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.812
Every relationship
I've ever had,

26:19.846 --> 26:21.013
I've always felt like I was

26:21.047 --> 26:22.414
walking on eggshells, you know?

26:22.448 --> 26:24.350
Like, I never knew
what I was gonna say or do

26:24.383 --> 26:26.685
that was gonna spin someone
out, cause them to get upset.

26:26.718 --> 26:29.989
Even when it had nothing to do
with me, I would try to fix it.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.723
Okay, that's my thing.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.994
And I've never felt that
eggshell thing with you, ever.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.029
Until tonight.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.167
Well, it wasn't
about you, you know?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.634
That's just how I react.

26:42.668 --> 26:45.604
When I get upset, I clam up.

26:45.637 --> 26:49.175
But, Sydney, I can't be responsible
for your insecurities.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.943
I know that.
I'm not asking you to be

26:50.977 --> 26:52.578
responsible for my insecurities.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.814
I just think it's important
for us to make this work,

26:55.848 --> 26:59.685
that we should know the areas that
could be problem areas, you know?

26:59.718 --> 27:01.520
My shit and your shit,
where they don't line up

27:01.553 --> 27:04.123
and where it could
flare up, that's all.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.926
Yeah.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.627
Yeah, okay.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.897
Okay?

27:10.930 --> 27:12.298
I feel like that was amazing,

27:12.331 --> 27:15.201
like that was very
grown-up, you know?

27:15.234 --> 27:16.768
Didn't that feel
grown-up to you?

27:16.802 --> 27:18.304
It was pretty
grown-up of us.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.371
Very adult.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.406
God.

27:21.407 --> 27:22.541
We're so mature.

27:22.574 --> 27:23.709
I'd like to think so.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.344
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

27:26.712 --> 27:29.348
Then we can do this.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.350
Ruff! Ruff!

27:32.551 --> 27:34.253
What is that
supposed to be?

27:34.286 --> 27:36.155
It's a hand monster.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.442
Do you wanna go
to the park, babe?

27:58.978 --> 28:00.579
Sunny?

28:01.747 --> 28:03.315
Sunny!

28:06.085 --> 28:07.486
♪ If I never met you baby

28:07.519 --> 28:10.389

28:46.025 --> 28:47.659
So, you give me a title,

28:47.693 --> 28:49.728
and I tell you what
the movie's about.

28:49.761 --> 28:51.763
Got it. Okay.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.799
"Baby, baby, baby."

28:53.832 --> 28:54.866
That's a good title.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.268
I know.

28:56.302 --> 28:59.571
"Baby, baby, baby"
is about this guy

28:59.605 --> 29:00.839
living in Los Angeles,

29:00.872 --> 29:05.311
and then one day he meets
this beautiful woman,

29:07.046 --> 29:09.415
and she's just got this
awful personality,

29:09.448 --> 29:12.051
it's just terrible.

29:12.084 --> 29:18.557
And she's got the best smile
he's ever seen in his life.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.028
And they both throw
away all their bullshit

29:22.061 --> 29:25.631
and their baggage,
and they fall in love.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.102
I don't know,
it sounds kinda boring.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.837
You didn't let me finish.
You see,

29:31.870 --> 29:35.307
'cause what makes "Baby,
baby, baby" so special

29:35.341 --> 29:38.977
is it's a true story.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.251
I love you.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.454
I love you, too.

29:49.888 --> 29:52.324
Baby, baby, baby.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.864
The baby thing
kinda freaks me out.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.366
Yeah, I know.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.234
Sometimes I think that
if you don't have children,

30:02.268 --> 30:05.671
then you get to
be one, you know?

30:05.704 --> 30:08.207
I'm not saying I wanna
have them now or anything.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.677
I'm just wondering
what you think of kids.

30:11.710 --> 30:15.514
Well, I think they're
small with big heads.

30:15.547 --> 30:18.317
You know, they usually
are kind of smaller,

30:18.350 --> 30:21.087
and I guess their heads
are kind of bigger.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.021
They usually come in
sets of two or four.

30:23.055 --> 30:26.058
'Cause, you know, single
children are awful people.

30:26.092 --> 30:30.129
And with three, you get a
middle child that's troubled.

30:31.863 --> 30:33.232
I'm a middle child.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.733
Case in point.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.104
You're an only child.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.605
I'm awful.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.875
What if you had
a baby that was a, uh,

30:43.909 --> 30:46.145
ginger, like me?

30:46.178 --> 30:48.514
Ooh. Hmm...

30:48.547 --> 30:51.483
Well, I mean, if I had a ginger
girl, it would be fabulous.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.253
Fire-red hair, bright
green eyes, very cute.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.255
Beautiful.
Yeah.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.424
But, a ginger boy,

30:58.457 --> 31:01.260
I'd throw him in a sack
and drown him in the river.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.562
Really? You wouldn't
give him away

31:03.595 --> 31:05.431
to some sweet couple
trying to have a baby?

31:05.464 --> 31:07.599
I'd be way too scared
that he'd come back

31:07.633 --> 31:09.935
when he was older
seeking revenge.

31:09.968 --> 31:13.705
I mean, there's nothing more
dangerous than a vengeful ginger.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.941
Better to drown him.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.344
Hmm.
That's good thinking, too.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.380
You should write
a book on parenting.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.438
Perfect.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.576
I'm not sure I understand
why I gave up

31:50.609 --> 31:53.545
my apartment to move into this crack den.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.315
I thought you said you
were excited to fix it up.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.485
No, I'm very
excited to fix it up.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.153
It's just, now that I'm looking

32:01.187 --> 32:03.755
at the full extent of its, uh,

32:03.789 --> 32:05.424
fucked-up-ed-ness...

32:05.457 --> 32:07.159
So, what are you saying?

32:07.193 --> 32:08.660
I think you
should break up with me

32:08.694 --> 32:11.797
and you should
start seeing Bob Vila.

32:11.830 --> 32:15.801
What I think is that you are freaked
out about moving in together

32:15.834 --> 32:18.337
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with this place.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.871
How could you say that?

32:19.905 --> 32:24.443
Because you're freaked out
about moving in together.

32:24.476 --> 32:28.079
Okay, I'm a little
scared about moving in together,

32:28.113 --> 32:29.215
but that's because,

32:29.248 --> 32:30.449
when you move in with someone,

32:30.482 --> 32:33.219
it turns into,
like, a science experiment.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.086
You're being
observed all the time.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.688
Okay, first of all,

32:36.722 --> 32:37.989
you're not moving in
with someone,

32:38.023 --> 32:39.491
you're moving in with me.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.361
Second of all, could we
have had this conversation

32:42.394 --> 32:45.931
maybe before you
gave up your apartment?

32:45.964 --> 32:49.235
Listen to me.
I wanna move in with you,

32:49.268 --> 32:53.239
but I have moments
where it's scary, right?

32:53.272 --> 32:55.106
And you just called me on one.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.109
And that's why
I wanna move in with you,

32:58.143 --> 32:59.545
because you call me
on stuff like that.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.046
But that's why I'm afraid
to move in with you,

33:01.079 --> 33:02.481
because you do stuff like that.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.750
Does that make sense?
This is gonna be fun.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.117
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.864
She came out first.

33:18.897 --> 33:21.199
I came out a minute later.
Smooth as hell.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.601
No one knew a thing.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.670
Congratulations on being
a mile-high member.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.506
Yeah. Yeah,
it's a pretty big deal.

33:27.539 --> 33:28.574
Hmm.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.077
Now it's my turn.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.079
I'm scared. Okay.
Okay.

33:34.112 --> 33:38.950
Have you ever been with more
than one guy at the same time?

33:38.984 --> 33:40.686
Don't ask me that.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.221
Jesus Christ.
You better talk, woman.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.626
I was in college, and there was

33:47.659 --> 33:50.529
a lot of drugs
and alcohol involved.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.698
Right. Do you really
wanna hear this?

33:52.731 --> 33:55.367
I really don't wanna talk about it.
Come on.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.903
Go on, I'm a big boy,
I can handle it.

33:57.936 --> 33:59.538
What, two guys?

33:59.571 --> 34:01.540
No, it was more than two.

34:06.077 --> 34:09.047
More than two? How many?

34:09.080 --> 34:11.650
You know, let's just drop it.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.851
No, no, no. I'm not gonna drop it.
I need to know.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.422
And that's the game.
How many?

34:17.755 --> 34:19.425
Five.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.928
Five?
Mmm.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.632
Five?
Yeah.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.135
Five disgusting frat boys
at the same time.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.402
Okay, they weren't frat boys.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.071
They were in the art department.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.572
Oh, right, of course.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.308
They were in the art department.

34:36.342 --> 34:38.543
I was drunk, I was on ecstasy.

34:38.577 --> 34:42.280
I felt awful about it when it was
happening. I was embarrassed.

34:42.313 --> 34:46.752
I still am. I've never... I've
never talked about it with anyone.

34:46.784 --> 34:51.590
Five. You know, five is an
entire starting basketball team.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.992
I'm sorry, were they
a basketball team?

34:54.025 --> 34:55.561
We promised not to
judge each other.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.128
That was your rule, by the way.

34:57.162 --> 35:00.899
I'm not judging. I'm just...
I'm judging a little bit.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.034
It's not like
they all came in me!

35:03.068 --> 35:06.438
What? What part of
your brain do you feel like

35:06.472 --> 35:09.107
that is supposed to
make me feel better?

35:09.140 --> 35:10.542
In the same part of my brain

35:10.576 --> 35:14.012
that should be telling that
you're a total asshole!

35:17.282 --> 35:19.117
I shouldn't have told you.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.787
No, I'm glad you told me.
I prefer the truth.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.321
But I think you should give me

35:23.355 --> 35:24.656
a little room to react here.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.892
That's pretty hardcore.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.462
Was it like...

35:33.298 --> 35:34.666
No. No,
it wasn't like that,

35:34.700 --> 35:38.470
because there were
two more dudes involved.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.873
That's great. Thank you.
Makes me feel better.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.542
You're welcome.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.653
You think it's this cold
in the North Pole?

35:54.686 --> 35:57.423
Aren't you from the East Coast?
Yeah.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.190
But I've lived here too long.

35:59.224 --> 36:01.026
I got soft.
Hmm.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.030
You want me to warm you up?

36:05.063 --> 36:07.733
You sure you don't wanna invite
the neighbors over first?

36:07.766 --> 36:09.568
See if they wanna join in on it?

36:09.601 --> 36:11.570
Fuck you, Sydney!

36:13.004 --> 36:14.444
I'm never telling you
anything again.

36:14.473 --> 36:15.874
Oh, come on.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.909
I'm sorry. I mean,
it was definitely my fault.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.845
I shouldn't have asked
that stupid question.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.212
You told me you were grateful

36:21.246 --> 36:22.347
for everything in my past

36:22.380 --> 36:23.682
because it made me who I am

36:23.715 --> 36:25.417
and brought me to you!

36:25.451 --> 36:29.721
That was before I knew you were
the Jezebel of Pittsburgh.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.232
I'm so sorry.

36:41.266 --> 36:43.101
That wasn't fair.
I don't wanna talk about it.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.703
Well, we don't
have to talk about it.

36:44.736 --> 36:48.874
We never have to
talk about it again.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.877
You know, that was a
messed-up time in my life

36:51.910 --> 36:55.714
and a really painful experience,

36:55.747 --> 36:57.449
and you're just
throwing it in my face.

36:57.483 --> 36:58.917
I didn't mean to.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.852
I really didn't.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.023
If I'm honest, the truth is

37:05.056 --> 37:06.424
it actually kinda turns me on.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.193
Oh, my God! Please.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.829
You know why they put

37:10.862 --> 37:13.364
those little ribbons
on hotel toilets?

37:13.398 --> 37:14.638
They're there to make you think

37:14.666 --> 37:16.702
no one's ever been there before.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.838
But trust me,
they've been there.

37:19.871 --> 37:23.475
Oh, yeah. They have
definitely been there.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.245
Karl and Susie had only
been dating for a year

37:27.278 --> 37:29.781
when they decided
to move in together.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.017
He was making good money
at the firm now,

37:32.050 --> 37:36.187
and her cooking blog
was really taking off.

37:36.221 --> 37:40.125
So they figured,
"Why not take a chance?"

37:40.158 --> 37:41.927
Where do you want this one?

37:41.960 --> 37:44.362
Oh, just in the corner there.

37:44.395 --> 37:46.598
What's in there?

37:46.632 --> 37:48.800
My baggage.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.869
What do you mean?

37:50.902 --> 37:54.506
You know, my baggage
that I brought with me.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.547
What are you doing?
It's a big box.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.582
You need some help?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.016
No, I'm good.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.756
Who's this?
Oh.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.625
Evan Lazarus,
my sixth grade boyfriend.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.160
I let him feel me up
in the auditorium,

38:15.193 --> 38:17.162
and he told
the whole school about it.

38:17.195 --> 38:18.797
She had great tits.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.398
I mean, I still have
nice tits. I have great tits.

38:20.431 --> 38:22.333
What the hell is he doing here?
It's my baggage.

38:22.367 --> 38:23.769
Bonjour.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.336
Who's this clown?

38:27.205 --> 38:28.840
Hi.

38:29.608 --> 38:32.243
Pierre?

38:32.277 --> 38:36.648
Hi. I met him the first
time I went to Paris.

38:36.682 --> 38:41.987
He, um, was the
best lover I ever had.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.455
I compare you to him
every time we have sex.

38:44.489 --> 38:48.326
I know it's not fair,
but I just can't help it.

38:48.359 --> 38:50.461
It was so good.
Mmm.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.263
A woman is a delicate flower,

38:52.297 --> 38:54.966
and you must always
water a flower from the top,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.102
never the bottom.
Yeah.

38:57.135 --> 39:01.339
And they will open just
like a beautiful rose.

39:01.372 --> 39:03.675
You're a lucky man.
Mmm.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.977
Thanks for the watering tip.

39:07.378 --> 39:08.880
Hello.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.683
My first lesbian experience.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.218
Hi. Who...

39:13.251 --> 39:14.653
My old boss.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.890
The basketball team.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.226
Basketball team.
Come on in, guys.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.361
And the coach.

39:23.394 --> 39:25.163
Very good student.

39:25.196 --> 39:28.700
Professor.
I really wanted an A.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.169
Oh, I felt
really bad for that one.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.505
My best friend's dad.
That was a low moment.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.907
That's it!

39:35.941 --> 39:37.508
No, not the lacrosse team?

39:37.542 --> 39:38.877
No, no. That's...
Just basketball?

39:38.910 --> 39:40.378
Yeah.
And the coach.

39:40.411 --> 39:41.512
This is exciting.

39:41.546 --> 39:42.914
Mmm, for who?

39:42.948 --> 39:44.750
For us, because,
like, I don't know,

39:44.783 --> 39:46.785
now you know
everything about me.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.787
Hey, where do you want this one?

39:48.820 --> 39:50.321
Oh, you can just leave
it right there actually.

39:50.355 --> 39:52.523
Or put it on the side.
Thanks. I'll take care of it.

39:52.557 --> 39:53.659
What's that?

39:53.692 --> 39:55.526
Oh, like, uh,

39:55.560 --> 39:57.796
towels and stuff.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.931
He makes me laugh.
You know,

39:59.965 --> 40:02.734
but at the same time,
he's an amazing person.

40:02.768 --> 40:04.202
As long as you're happy.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.204
I am.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.373
It's just,
he's a little insecure.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.743
It's kind of like he always needs
everybody to like him all the time.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.144
Needs a lot of attention.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.445
Actors, man.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.481
Either they have an extra
gene, or they're missing one.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.218
But, at the same time,

40:20.251 --> 40:21.753
I love being with him.

40:21.787 --> 40:24.756
And he makes me laugh.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.926
Yeah. You said that already.

40:34.733 --> 40:35.767
Sorry.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.436
Sorry about that.
Excuse me.

40:38.469 --> 40:41.139
Sorry. Thank you.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.677
Excuse me.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.785
Hey.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.721
Oh, hey, Sydney.

40:55.754 --> 40:58.957
This is
Sebastian Kurtz-Wuhler.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.859
Hello.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

41:00.892 --> 41:03.294
Sebastian, he owns
the Kurtz-Wuhler Galleries.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.897
You know, the ones I'm constantly
going on and on about?

41:05.931 --> 41:08.399
I mean, they're kind of
the biggest in the world.

41:08.433 --> 41:09.735
You exaggerate.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.136
Yes, they are.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.706
Well, congratulations.
That's great.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.775
Thank you. It is my passion.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.780
And, uh, what is your costume?

41:21.813 --> 41:24.149
I'm a naked guy in a barrel.

41:25.383 --> 41:27.018
Why?

41:28.319 --> 41:33.624
'Cause I lost all my clothes
in a poker game,

41:33.658 --> 41:35.426
or it's the Old West.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.496
It doesn't matter. I'm a naked
guy in a barrel, right?

41:38.529 --> 41:42.367
Sebastian was just actually telling
me this hilarious story

41:42.400 --> 41:44.269
about this swimming goat.

41:44.302 --> 41:45.470
Yes.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.172
I mean...

41:47.205 --> 41:49.174
Swimming goat.
It's just an anecdote

41:49.207 --> 41:52.277
from my family's
vineyard in Espana.

41:53.411 --> 41:54.946
Vineyard?

41:54.980 --> 41:58.316
It's a small vineyard. Can you
believe that? It's amazing.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.486
My grandfather used to grow
wine grapes around his sukkah.

42:02.921 --> 42:05.556
They're pretty good,
too, I think.

42:05.590 --> 42:06.858
Hmm.

42:06.892 --> 42:08.659
Let me just get this
out of the way for you.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.428
Hey, babe.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.331
Jesus.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.067
Okay. It was nice
meeting you.

42:16.101 --> 42:17.668
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.872
Sunny, a pleasure meeting you.

42:20.906 --> 42:22.273
Pleasure was all mine.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.409
I look forward to
seeing your work sometime.

42:24.442 --> 42:26.044
Thank you.

42:26.744 --> 42:27.913
Wow.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.014
Kind of a...

42:29.047 --> 42:30.048
I have to get back to work.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.250
Talk to you in a bit.

42:34.252 --> 42:37.555
L'chaim, cowboy.
Nice barrel.

42:37.588 --> 42:39.690
What you got under there?

42:39.724 --> 42:42.293
Oh! Just an incredibly
small penis.

42:46.431 --> 42:48.900
Let me drop some
knowledge on you, okay?

42:48.934 --> 42:50.735
I have three very simple rules

42:50.768 --> 42:52.703
for Halloween costumes for men.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.372
One, you gotta look good.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.508
You gotta feel sexy or whatever.

42:57.542 --> 43:00.611
Two, you gotta
be comfortable. And C,

43:00.645 --> 43:02.780
you gotta have easy,
quick access to your bits.

43:02.814 --> 43:06.717
Whether that's to make water
or sow the seeds of love.

43:06.751 --> 43:10.521
And you, my friend, have broken
all three of those rules.

43:10.555 --> 43:14.525
Women, on the other hand,
they just have one rule,

43:14.559 --> 43:16.327
and that's that
it has to be slutty.

43:16.361 --> 43:19.130
The costume's gotta be slutty.

43:19.164 --> 43:21.099
With or without cat ears.

43:21.132 --> 43:23.734
Look at that, slutty nurse.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.270
Hi.

43:25.303 --> 43:28.406
Slutty girl from
Gatsby who golfed.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.942
Slut... I don't
even know what that is.

43:30.976 --> 43:32.743
That's a loofah.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.512
That's a good costume, man.

43:34.545 --> 43:36.181
Hey, babe.

43:39.450 --> 43:41.352
I need to get scrubbed later.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.354
Now. I need to
get scrubbed now.

43:50.795 --> 43:54.933
He's kind of
a big deal, isn't he?

43:54.966 --> 43:58.970
It's my biggest dream to show
at one of his galleries.

44:01.006 --> 44:04.342
You think you're
too beautiful for me.

44:04.809 --> 44:06.711
What?

44:06.744 --> 44:13.318
It's just you are so
beautiful and so wonderful.

44:13.351 --> 44:17.388
And I'm like this sick mantis.

44:17.422 --> 44:18.756
Praying mantis.

44:18.789 --> 44:20.458
Yeah.

44:20.491 --> 44:23.161
Or, um, E.T., you know, when he's
all sick and dying by the river,

44:23.194 --> 44:24.896
and he's flaky and white.

44:28.499 --> 44:31.469
Then tell me,
what are you so afraid of?

44:34.372 --> 44:36.541
This ending.

44:40.178 --> 44:45.550
"I have loved the stars too fondly
to be fearful of the night."

44:47.585 --> 44:49.420
Galileo.

44:51.556 --> 44:54.192
Galileo never met you.

44:58.896 --> 45:05.070
♪ I just want you

45:05.103 --> 45:08.606
♪ To love me

45:12.443 --> 45:14.112
Don't be this guy.

45:14.145 --> 45:15.346
Be that guy.

45:16.081 --> 45:18.383
Don't be this guy.

45:18.416 --> 45:20.818
Ooh, ooh, come here. Come here, it's me.
Be that guy.

45:20.851 --> 45:23.188
Don't be this guy.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.023
Be that guy.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.192
Don't be this guy.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.459
It's really funny.

45:28.493 --> 45:29.527
Be that guy.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.263
It's awful.
It's humiliating.

45:32.297 --> 45:34.132
I'm like the before picture.

45:34.165 --> 45:37.402
Oh, come on. You're adorable.
You're cute.

45:37.435 --> 45:40.538
I don't wanna do
these commercials anymore.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.873
I've been thinking about it.

45:42.907 --> 45:45.143
I wanna focus on my writing.

45:45.176 --> 45:46.611
What do you think?

45:46.644 --> 45:48.013
I think that's great.

45:48.046 --> 45:50.548
I was reading this New Yorker
short story the other day,

45:50.581 --> 45:53.251
and I was like,
"Okay, this is good,"

45:53.284 --> 45:55.153
but it's not like,
you know, I wanna change

45:55.186 --> 45:56.954
my religion or anything,
you know?

45:56.988 --> 45:59.457
And that's The New Yorker. And
I thought, "I could do that."

45:59.490 --> 46:01.292
Well, then that's
what you should do.

46:01.326 --> 46:04.495
"Be bold and mighty forces
will come to your aid."

46:04.529 --> 46:06.031
Basil King.

46:07.298 --> 46:08.733
I have no idea who that is.

46:11.069 --> 46:13.038
I was thinking about
it the other night.

46:13.071 --> 46:15.006
I was just like,
"I should do this."

46:15.040 --> 46:18.176
Then I fell asleep
and I dreamt I got

46:18.209 --> 46:22.713
eaten by a school
of clown fish. Yeah.

46:22.747 --> 46:25.816
You know,
I, uh, once had this dream

46:25.850 --> 46:29.420
that I was sitting across from
my mom at the dinner table,

46:29.454 --> 46:31.922
and all of a sudden, she
just rips open her chest,

46:31.956 --> 46:33.491
pulls out a rib

46:33.524 --> 46:37.028
and starts screwing me with it.

46:39.164 --> 46:40.598
I think we should break up.

46:40.631 --> 46:44.135
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

46:44.169 --> 46:46.037
I think you need to...

46:46.071 --> 46:48.606
It was horrible! I couldn't talk
to my mom for, like, three months.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.208
I wonder if it
was worse to have it

46:50.241 --> 46:52.710
than to have you tell
me about it, honestly.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.146
It's bad news, man.

46:55.180 --> 46:56.514
You still love me, right?

46:56.547 --> 46:57.415
Yeah, yeah, sure.

46:57.448 --> 46:58.816
I'm gonna pull out my rib

46:58.849 --> 47:01.086
and take care of you in a second.

47:04.522 --> 47:06.957
Why would anyone want duck
for Thanksgiving?

47:06.991 --> 47:08.959
I'm a turkey man.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.461
I like at 3:00
in the morning,

47:10.495 --> 47:12.029
you come down for leftovers,

47:12.063 --> 47:15.166
and you take a little cold
turkey, a little cold stuffing,

47:15.200 --> 47:16.334
a little cold mashed potatoes,

47:16.367 --> 47:18.069
a little cold cranberry, gravy,

47:18.103 --> 47:20.343
you smoosh it between two of
those King's Hawaiian rolls,

47:20.371 --> 47:22.407
and you shove it in your face
in your underpants.

47:23.374 --> 47:24.614
I like that.
That's what I like.

47:24.642 --> 47:26.177
I've never had one of those.

47:26.211 --> 47:29.747
Well, you're not
a patriot like me, so...

47:30.981 --> 47:32.750
Sydney?

47:34.018 --> 47:35.253
Hey.

47:35.886 --> 47:37.222
Hey, how are you?

47:37.255 --> 47:39.857
I'm amazing.

47:39.890 --> 47:43.094
Wow. That's, uh, great.
I'm happy to hear that.

47:43.128 --> 47:47.165
Yeah, I'm having a terrific
time in my life right now.

47:47.632 --> 47:48.666
Oh.

47:49.134 --> 47:51.001
How are you?

47:51.035 --> 47:53.070
Uh, I'm great. I'm great.

47:53.104 --> 47:55.506
You know, pregnant.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.945
I guess it's good that
you're not just fat, right?

48:00.978 --> 48:02.780
Yeah, yeah.

48:03.781 --> 48:04.849
Hi, I'm Sunny.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.284
Courtney.

48:06.317 --> 48:09.887
Oh, right, yeah. Courtney,
this is, um, Sunny.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.722
Sunny, this is Courtney.

48:11.756 --> 48:13.358
Yeah.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.826
So, how's the, um, acting?

48:15.860 --> 48:17.828
It's good. I kind of
took a break from it.

48:17.862 --> 48:20.731
I'm focusing on my writing
right now a lot.

48:20.765 --> 48:22.133
Is it going well?

48:22.167 --> 48:23.634
Oh, yeah, it's amazing.

48:23.668 --> 48:25.670
It's really going...
And we moved in together,

48:25.703 --> 48:28.773
and that's really nice also.
It's really good.

48:28.806 --> 48:31.008
I'm happy for you, Sydney.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.710
It was really great seeing you.

48:32.743 --> 48:35.180
Yeah, it was amazing
to see you. Really amazing.

48:35.213 --> 48:36.947
Yeah, okay.

48:36.981 --> 48:39.584
Well, um, I hope you guys have
a really nice Thanksgiving.

48:39.617 --> 48:42.287
Yeah. You, too. And
also congratulations.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.390
Yeah, also congratulations.

48:51.662 --> 48:52.897
What?

48:52.930 --> 48:54.265
"Amazing"?

48:54.299 --> 48:56.534
Really?

48:56.567 --> 49:00.405
May your stuffing be tasty,
may your turkey plump.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.940
May your potatoes,
gravy nary a lump.

49:02.973 --> 49:07.578
May your yams be delicious
and your pies take the prize,

49:07.612 --> 49:10.080
and may your Thanksgiving
dinner stay off your thighs.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.116
Oh!

49:14.118 --> 49:16.187
All right.
Down there, J.B.

49:16.221 --> 49:17.855
I love you, man.

49:17.888 --> 49:20.258
I love you, too. I love your face.
I love your neck.

49:23.194 --> 49:25.496
I don't drink.

49:25.530 --> 49:27.632
The plan is for
everyone to stay clothed

49:27.665 --> 49:29.400
- the whole night.
- The whole night.

49:29.434 --> 49:30.768
I can do it.
I can do it. I'm not...

49:30.801 --> 49:31.836
Please.

49:31.869 --> 49:33.871
Sunny, what's the story
with you and the...

49:33.904 --> 49:35.105
No, I don't eat gluten.

49:35.139 --> 49:36.274
I'm so sorry.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.309
So sorry.
That was so rude of me.

49:40.745 --> 49:42.580
That's
what I like, class!

49:46.317 --> 49:48.486
I told you!
My friend is a classy man.

49:48.519 --> 49:51.689
I don't eat animals.

49:51.722 --> 49:54.259
Nice that people
celebrate the annihilation

49:54.292 --> 49:56.126
of a race and
the stealing of their land.

49:57.528 --> 49:58.863
That's our thing.

49:58.896 --> 49:59.997
Seriously.

50:00.030 --> 50:02.767
In January at
the Los Angeles Gallery.

50:02.800 --> 50:06.337
And we'd like to
present a new artist.

50:06.371 --> 50:11.909
And we agree that we would
be most happy to have you.

50:15.413 --> 50:16.814
Wait, are you serious?

50:16.847 --> 50:18.549
Yes, of course.

50:18.583 --> 50:20.985
I don't even know what to say.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.219
You must say yes.

50:22.253 --> 50:23.354
Um, yes, of course!

50:24.955 --> 50:27.024
No, believe me, it's a
smart move on my part.

50:27.057 --> 50:28.326
It's incredible.

50:28.359 --> 50:29.860
My own show.
It's incredible, yeah.

50:29.894 --> 50:32.797
I... Oh, my God. Thank you.

50:33.831 --> 50:35.032
That's great.

50:35.065 --> 50:36.934
And I thank you.

50:36.967 --> 50:38.403
How cool is this guy?

50:41.572 --> 50:43.941
Your girl seems really nice.

50:43.974 --> 50:47.578
She's tall and thin.

50:47.612 --> 50:49.580
I met her in
a woodworking class.

50:49.614 --> 50:52.049
You're taking woodworking?
What? No.

50:52.082 --> 50:53.618
No?
No.

50:55.286 --> 50:58.956
What the hell was with that Sebastian guy?
He's the worst.

50:58.989 --> 51:01.258
No. Man's a sweetheart.

51:01.292 --> 51:04.261
You know where he went? He
went to get better champagne.

51:04.295 --> 51:06.263
And he invited me skiing.

51:06.297 --> 51:09.567
Apparently, he's got a
sick chalet up in Mammoth.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.901
Of course he does.

51:10.935 --> 51:13.270
And she just loves
a guy with an accent.

51:13.304 --> 51:17.342
I don't know, man. Lately, I feel
like there's been this, like,

51:17.375 --> 51:19.076
growing distance between us.

51:19.109 --> 51:21.211
Whoa, brother.

51:21.245 --> 51:23.914
You gotta take a step back.

51:23.948 --> 51:25.750
Take three steps back.

51:25.783 --> 51:30.521
Because if you're chasing it, I guarantee
you, it's running away from you.

51:30.555 --> 51:32.957
Yeah, that's easy to say, but,
okay, we're living together.

51:32.990 --> 51:34.992
You know what I mean?
I mean, I'm in.

51:35.025 --> 51:37.795
She's not in as far as I am.

51:37.828 --> 51:41.298
In every relationship, you've
got the lover and the loved,

51:41.332 --> 51:46.337
and the loved always has
the upper hand, my man.

51:48.939 --> 51:53.378
I think it is
a beautiful tradition, um,

51:53.411 --> 51:55.846
this, um,
taking a moment to express

51:55.880 --> 51:57.360
the things for
which you are grateful.

51:58.182 --> 51:59.417
Um...

52:00.551 --> 52:04.321
We did not do it
when I was growing up.

52:04.355 --> 52:09.660
But every year, I go and
build houses and schools

52:09.694 --> 52:13.197
for the impoverished
children of Namibia.

52:13.230 --> 52:17.134
That trip always reminds me

52:17.167 --> 52:22.740
that I must live in
a place of gratitude.

52:22.773 --> 52:26.844
Because it is so
important to remember that

52:26.877 --> 52:33.117
you cannot be grateful only
for one day, for one meal.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.952
- Hear, hear, man.
- Hear, hear.

52:34.985 --> 52:36.921
You brought
that home quite nicely.

52:36.954 --> 52:41.592
I'm sorry. So, what exactly is
it that you're grateful for?

52:41.626 --> 52:44.395
For this moment
and for your kindness.

52:44.429 --> 52:46.864
That's nice. That's really nice.
That is beautiful.

52:46.897 --> 52:48.699
Thank you.
That is beautiful.

52:48.733 --> 52:51.035
Well, I guess I'm thankful
that we're all here.

52:51.068 --> 52:53.871
And I'm not talking about
this house, either, you guys.

52:53.904 --> 52:56.574
I'm talking about here.
I'm talking about being alive.

52:56.607 --> 52:58.976
Starting with our great, great,

52:59.009 --> 53:01.579
great grandparents
meeting and fucking

53:01.612 --> 53:03.481
and our parents.

53:03.514 --> 53:05.683
Coitus. Filthy.

53:06.484 --> 53:09.319
Loveless.

53:09.353 --> 53:14.625
You change one tiny grain of
sand in that entire equation,

53:15.860 --> 53:18.529
none of us
is even a thought.

53:21.031 --> 53:26.571
Now, I'm also thankful for this
one's background in dance.

53:26.604 --> 53:31.108
Cecilia, um,
what are you grateful for?

53:31.141 --> 53:35.580
Oh, I prefer to keep my
gratitudes to myself. Thank you.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.553
He didn't have any
plans for Thanksgiving.

53:42.587 --> 53:44.622
Besides, he's great.

53:44.655 --> 53:46.290
And he's giving me
my own show, which,

53:46.323 --> 53:48.759
I mean, do you understand
how huge that is for me?

53:48.793 --> 53:50.360
I'm just surprised
that Mr. Wonderful

53:50.394 --> 53:54.932
didn't have a million
Thanksgiving invitations.

53:54.965 --> 53:58.636
And you give me shit about how
I act when I see Courtney.

53:58.669 --> 54:00.237
Courtney's your
ex-girlfriend!

54:00.270 --> 54:01.939
What the hell does she
have to do with anything?

54:01.972 --> 54:04.975
You turn into a schoolgirl
around this guy.

54:05.009 --> 54:06.511
It's gross.

54:12.116 --> 54:16.654
Yeah, and sure, he's rich,
and he's, uh, charming,

54:16.687 --> 54:18.923
and he's successful,
and he's funny,

54:18.956 --> 54:20.825
but, you know,
he's got an art gallery.

54:20.858 --> 54:22.960
You take all that away,
really, what has he got?

54:22.993 --> 54:25.630
Okay, in case you
didn't realize, Sydney,

54:25.663 --> 54:29.133
I'm going to bed
with you, not Sebastian.

54:29.166 --> 54:31.068
It's just frustrating
to see your girlfriend

54:31.101 --> 54:32.970
flirting with a geriatric case.

54:33.003 --> 54:35.606
Oh, my God!
I was not flirting with him!

54:35.640 --> 54:38.609
Plus, you know, you've been
drinking like every day lately.

54:38.643 --> 54:41.145
Okay, okay, it's Thanksgiving.
Give me a fucking break.

54:41.178 --> 54:44.081
Yeah, I know. And yesterday,
it was Wednesday,

54:44.114 --> 54:45.550
and the day before
that it was Tuesday,

54:45.583 --> 54:47.184
and I think before that, Monday.

54:47.217 --> 54:48.686
So explain this to me, okay?

54:48.719 --> 54:50.287
What is it exactly
you're upset about?

54:50.320 --> 54:52.089
The fact that you think
that I'm an alcoholic now

54:52.122 --> 54:54.024
or that I was
flirting with Sebastian?

54:54.058 --> 54:55.359
I'm not upset!

54:55.392 --> 54:57.562
I'm just frustrated because...
You're frustrated.

54:57.595 --> 54:58.896
You know, you live with someone,

54:58.929 --> 55:00.531
and you start to see
things that you go,

55:00.565 --> 55:02.166
"Okay, that can
improve that person,

55:02.199 --> 55:04.501
"that can improve the
relationship," and so you...

55:04.535 --> 55:06.704
You call them out.

55:06.737 --> 55:08.573
Okay, well, I'll be
sure to call you out

55:08.606 --> 55:11.909
tomorrow morning on
all of your bullshit.

55:17.882 --> 55:20.250
Don't fucking
try it, Sydney.

55:21.619 --> 55:23.554
I mean it.

55:47.411 --> 55:49.046
Oh, my God.

55:49.079 --> 55:50.547
I told you.

55:50.581 --> 55:52.617
That is amazing.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.552
Mmm.

55:55.586 --> 55:58.155
You're not getting this back.

55:58.188 --> 55:59.790
Okay.

56:10.334 --> 56:12.870
Was at this party and we had
a big fight. I was so miserable.

56:12.903 --> 56:16.240
So I said to myself, "You take a
picture of yourself right now."

56:16.273 --> 56:18.776
And I said, "You remember
how miserable you are."

56:18.809 --> 56:20.344
"So, in six months,
when you're like,

56:20.377 --> 56:22.446
"'I gotta get her back!
I gotta get her back, '

56:22.479 --> 56:25.716
"you look at that picture and you
remember how miserable you were."

56:25.750 --> 56:30.387
So I did it. Six months later, I'm
exactly where I said I was gonna be.

56:30.420 --> 56:32.623
I look at the picture.

56:32.657 --> 56:36.761
I say to myself, "I don't
look miserable at all."

56:48.839 --> 56:51.275
God, this is so relaxing.

56:55.846 --> 56:58.415
You sure this is mud?

56:58.448 --> 57:01.686
I don't think this is mud.

57:01.719 --> 57:03.821
You just don't
know how to relax.

57:03.854 --> 57:05.990
I didn't realize
that submerging yourself

57:06.023 --> 57:08.125
in warm fecal matter
was relaxing.

57:08.158 --> 57:10.627
Hey, coming here was
your idea, remember?

57:10.661 --> 57:12.629
No, I'm really glad
we came here.

57:12.663 --> 57:16.500
I wanted to do something
nice for your birthday.

57:16.533 --> 57:19.136
I'm having a really good time.

57:19.169 --> 57:22.439
Yeah, you look it.

57:22.472 --> 57:26.076
Are you ready for
your placenta facial?

57:26.110 --> 57:26.977
Yeah.

57:27.011 --> 57:28.445
I'll be right back.

57:28.478 --> 57:29.814
Thank you.

57:41.892 --> 57:45.362
I have mud in crevices
I didn't even know I had.

57:45.395 --> 57:46.831
You hope it's mud.

57:46.864 --> 57:48.899
You hope it's mud.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.807
What you doing?

57:56.841 --> 57:59.844
Just working on some
stuff for the show.

58:06.683 --> 58:08.452
What's this?

58:08.485 --> 58:10.755
It's a hockey stick.

58:22.733 --> 58:24.168
Oh, baby.

58:24.201 --> 58:25.736
I got you the kind you like.

58:25.770 --> 58:28.405
And I thought you could
just take it anywhere.

58:28.438 --> 58:29.706
It's perfect.

58:29.740 --> 58:31.241
Yeah, you like it?

58:31.275 --> 58:33.043
Oh, I love it.

58:33.077 --> 58:36.046
You do?
I do. You're so sweet.

58:36.080 --> 58:38.448
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

58:42.252 --> 58:44.188
I got something else
for you, too.

58:44.221 --> 58:45.055
Oh, yeah?

58:45.089 --> 58:47.892
Yeah.
What is that?

58:51.595 --> 58:52.797
Syd.

58:52.830 --> 58:54.531
Sunny.

58:54.564 --> 58:56.801
Syd.
Sunny.

58:56.834 --> 58:59.003
Syd, stop please.

59:00.104 --> 59:01.605
What?

59:01.638 --> 59:03.941
I just... I don't...

59:03.974 --> 59:06.743
I don't feel like...

59:06.777 --> 59:09.613
I really need to finish
this right now, okay?

59:09.646 --> 59:11.816
And I really wanna relax.

59:11.849 --> 59:14.084
Yeah, that's what
I wanna do, too.

59:14.118 --> 59:16.153
I wanna relax.
Let's relax.

59:16.186 --> 59:19.189
Syd, no, I'm serious.
I'm serious.

59:21.358 --> 59:22.759
I...

59:22.793 --> 59:24.694
I wanna fool around later, okay?

59:24.728 --> 59:26.596
Yeah.

59:26.630 --> 59:31.235
But right now, I really need to
finish this, and I wanna be mellow.

59:31.268 --> 59:33.637
Sure.

59:33.670 --> 59:37.107
Plus, I think that treatment
gave me a bit of a headache.

59:37.141 --> 59:40.044
Another headache, huh?
You okay?

59:40.077 --> 59:43.147
Yeah.
Well, I've been exhausted.

59:43.180 --> 59:45.816
I've been working five
nights a week at the bar

59:45.850 --> 59:48.518
and then doing this all day.

59:48.552 --> 59:52.056
I'm rundown,
I'm exhausted, I'm tired.

59:53.891 --> 59:55.759
But that's it, okay?

59:55.792 --> 59:57.161
Sure.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.798
I was just trying to be cute.

01:00:02.232 --> 01:00:03.233
Hey.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:07.304
You are cute.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.339
And sweet.

01:00:11.508 --> 01:00:13.978
Will you just lay with me?

01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:17.214
Yeah.

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:18.849
Sure.

01:00:20.017 --> 01:00:22.352
Whatever you want.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:24.288
Thank you.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.863
When you give
your heart to someone,

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:34.698
all it takes is one look,

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:39.203
and they can turn your entire
world to black and white.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:48.345
Stan and Genevieve Taft
met in college.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:51.648
They fell in love
and they got married.

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:55.552
But lately,
Stan had noticed a shift.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:03.427
Genevieve seemed distant,
withdrawn.

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:10.067
It seemed that
her love for him was fading.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.136
Maybe there was another man.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:16.373
Or maybe their love
had just run its course.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:20.677
Stan began to panic.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:23.247
He began to grow insecure.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.649
And as he got more
and more insecure,

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:29.453
he began to notice a very
strange thing happening.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:46.436
At first, it seemed impossible.

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:53.043
But then it was undeniable.

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:04.221
Stan was shrinking.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:17.234
The more she pulled away,
the more insecure he got.

01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:22.439
The more insecure he got,
the more he shrank.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:26.943
And the more he shrank,
the more she pulled away.

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:48.298
One Friday afternoon, he came
home to find an empty house.

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:53.703
She was gone, and there was
nothing he could do to change it.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.544
And that was the end of
the Incredible Shrinking Stan.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:07.984
Smidge higher
than the rest of them.

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:10.754
You know what I mean? I kinda
want it to be the focal point.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.789
That's okay.

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:15.692
You know, or we can even just
lower the ones on the side.

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:16.926
Hey, you.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.062
Hey!

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:19.763
Looks amazing in here.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:20.930
It's like a real art show.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.232
Right?

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.404
Is that a painting of me?

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:29.073
No.

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:31.508
Looks like me.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.344
It's an amalgamation of a
bunch of different people.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:40.016
Looks like a ugly-ass,
twisted version of me.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:41.685
To me.

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:43.687
Way to be egocentric.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.890
No, I'm just remembering the
story you told me about Picasso

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.092
when he started
falling out of love

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.226
with people, they got uglier...

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:51.961
Well, it's not you, okay?

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.597
How's Sebastian doing?

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.299
You know what, Sydney,
I'm really busy right now,

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.966
so maybe we could just
do this a little bit later?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.268
What? I'm just asking,
how is he?

01:03:58.302 --> 01:03:59.903
Can you stop
being such an asshole?

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:01.838
Oh, really? I didn't realize
it was an asshole thing to do

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.607
to support your girlfriend
while she tries

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.375
to make her dreams a reality.
I'm sorry.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:07.411
It is when you
make it all about you.

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:10.380
Hey, guys, who does that
painting look like to you?

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:13.850
To me, it looks like a Georges
Braque imitation, only more surreal.

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:16.386
Not the painting, the guy in
it, who does that look like?

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.388
I thought it was a cat.
Sydney.

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:20.524
Sydney.
Oh, this clown.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:23.059
Hey, Sebastian, how are you?
Hey, Sydney.

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:24.261
I'm very well, thanks.
How are you?

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.895
I'm good. I'm good.

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:27.164
Can I ask you a question real quick?
Sydney, don't.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.565
No, no, no, real quick.

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.700
Um, who does that
painting look like to you?

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:33.203
Sunny told me
it was a painting of you.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:34.571
She did? She said that?

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.506
I think it is very beautiful.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.409
What I said is it's an
amalgamation of a bunch of people,

01:04:39.443 --> 01:04:41.511
and you're one of them, yes.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:44.281
Yes, no, to me you said that.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:46.583
To the most interesting man
in the world over there,

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.418
you said just
it is a painting of me.

01:04:48.452 --> 01:04:49.653
Sebastian, I am so sorry.

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:51.421
Would you mind
giving us a second?

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:53.357
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
Sorry. Nice to see you.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.925
Guys, would you mind?
Thank you. Sure.

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:57.661
See ya, fellas.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.599
So what, Sydney, honestly?

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.269
It's my work.
It's my painting.

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:09.173
You know, in your stories, you
make me seem like this cold bitch.

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:13.310
Well, you know,
if it quacks like a duck.

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:15.412
Oh, and by the way, this
whole thing with Sebastian?

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:19.549
There's a word for people who
flirt with somebody to get ahead.

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:22.319
Are you calling me a whore?

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:25.322
Well, that depends on
if you fucked him or not.

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:34.164
Oh, baby.

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:38.468
Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:43.440
I don't even know who's
payin' me, and I don't want to know.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.008
What's the difference?

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.810
Didn't it occur to you
why they want you to do it?

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:50.079
Certainly it did, but that
makes them suckers, not me.

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:51.781
I'm the guy
who's gettin' it made.

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:54.083
Listen, Sheriff, a man
can stand for so much

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:55.819
and no more.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:58.622
Now, before the war, I
drifted and drifted and ran.

01:05:58.655 --> 01:06:01.191
Always lost in
the great big crowd.

01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:03.327
Hey.
Hey.

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.598
You wanna talk?

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:12.336
I think that's
a good idea, don't you?

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:18.808
I've been feeling
really far from you lately,

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:20.544
and that makes me very insecure.

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:23.179
And I do stupid shit, okay?

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:25.449
And if you wanna
paint me like that,

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.284
of course you should be able
to paint me like that.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.853
Can we talk?

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:31.655
I mean, really talk.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.257
If you tell me that you love me,

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.024
but you're not in love with me,

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:36.726
I'm just telling you right now,
I'm gonna have a freak-out.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.695
I'm gonna freak out right now.
No!

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.898
I just don't think
I love you anymore.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:47.771
Love is like faith, you know?

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:51.908
You can't fake it. You
either have it or you don't.

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:56.513
You don't have some special quote
for ripping a guy's heart out?

01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:00.717
"Breaking up is hard to do."

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.922
Really?

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.392
You suck.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:11.160
♪ Kissin', kissin', kissin'

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.830

♪ I miss your kissin'

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:47.263
What the fuck is this?

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:49.766
It's a video I cut together.
I'm gonna send it to her.

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:53.603
No. No, man, you're
not gonna send her this.

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:57.307
What are you doing?
Yes, it's gonna make her cry.

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:01.244
Why do you wanna make her cry?

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.483
The words "I don't
love you anymore," hey,

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:09.619
you can't take those back.
That's what she said, okay?

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:11.154
That ends the show, man.

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:12.622
That's game over.

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.991
I'm so angry at her.

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.292
Good.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:19.028
Good. That means
you're already past denial.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:21.930
Now you just gotta figure out
bargaining and, uh, depression,

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:25.635
and I think there's some...
There's a few other stages.

01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:28.372
And then you're in the clear.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.975
Come hit with me.

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:34.344
Yes.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:38.214
Spinalingading. Dong.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.249
Let's go.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.520
I wish I could get her back so
that I could break up with her.

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:45.921
Well, that sounds reasonable.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.459
I wish I knew that the last time
we fucked, that was the last time.

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:51.961
That sounds logical.

01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:54.330
I wish she got hit
by a fucking train...

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:57.401
That sounds a little crazy.
That's crazy talk, man.

01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:59.636
Listen, go write something.

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:01.871
Go sleep with
a waitress or a barista,

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.741
anyone in the food
service industry.

01:09:04.774 --> 01:09:06.876
Get your confidence back,
you know?

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:09.312
Start feeling
like yourself again.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:12.682
Feeling good.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:15.452
I'm sorry, man. That was way too hard.
I'm sorry.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.687
I'm sorry.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:23.192
They say heartbreak actually
leaves little tiny tears on your heart,

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:27.296
and there's no doctor in the
world that can help you.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.633
Well, maybe there's one.

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:35.138
Well, Mr. Carlin,
that wasn't so bad, was it?

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.840
Okay, what's the word, Doc?

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:39.242
All in all,
your health seems fine.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:40.844
Yeah?

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.746
But it appears you've
developed a heart condition.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:45.749
A heart condition! Oh, my God!
What? What is it?

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:49.953
Well, a protective shell
has formed around your heart.

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:51.154
A shell?

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.622
Yeah.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:55.124
It's a result of past trauma.
It's not uncommon.

01:09:55.158 --> 01:09:56.225
Is it dangerous?

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:57.827
Well,

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:00.229
it might keep you from living
a full and complete life.

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:03.232
Well... It can lead to
depression, solitude,

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:06.936
and, in extreme cases, the
adoption of many, many cats.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:10.674
Oh, my...
But that's just in women.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.010
Have you gone through
a break-up recently?

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.279
Yes, I have
just a few months ago!

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:17.547
Uh-huh.

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:19.883
I'm gonna write
you a prescription.

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:25.622
Now, I must warn you,
it is a bit experimental.

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:28.291
What is it?

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.426
Let me show you.

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:45.141
You should take her three times a day.
Excuse me?

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:48.444
I also recommend
walks on the beach with her,

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:55.852
candlelit dinners, weekend getaways,
and the occasional argument.

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:59.155
It is my
hope that Gisela here

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:01.891
will penetrate that
wall that has formed

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:03.827
around your heart and open it up

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.997
so that you may live
a full and complete life.

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:12.001
Really? It's amazing how far
medical science has come.

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:14.504
Yeah, but I must warn you again,

01:11:14.538 --> 01:11:18.041
she comes with
potential side effects.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.185
Is this covered by my insurance?

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.520
No, baby.

01:11:30.554 --> 01:11:32.188
It's cash only.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:37.520
Hey, Sydney.

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.590
Wow. That's a real baby
you got there.

01:12:40.624 --> 01:12:42.025
Yeah.

01:12:43.627 --> 01:12:46.129
You seem really happy.
That's good.

01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:47.430
Yeah.

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.332
You don't.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.300
What's going on, Syd?

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:54.037
Did you break up
with that pretty girl?

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:57.941
Yeah, we broke up and...

01:12:57.974 --> 01:13:01.611
Can I ask you a question?
You'll answer me honestly?

01:13:01.645 --> 01:13:03.512
I'll try.

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:06.049
Is there
something wrong with me?

01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:08.952
There's something
wrong with all of us.

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:11.855
But am I more fucked-up?

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.423
Like, when we were going out.

01:13:14.457 --> 01:13:17.593
I keep watching myself make the
same mistakes over and over again.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.129
And there's nothing more
frustrating than watching yourself

01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:21.765
and I know
I'm making the mistakes,

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:24.300
and I still can't
do anything about it.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.469
What are you looking for?

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:28.805
How'd you get here?

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:30.139
Is it just because you never had

01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:32.809
your heart broken,
you can just...

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:35.544
Oh, God. Of course
I've had my heart broken.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:39.983
When we broke up,
my heart was destroyed.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:43.386
Really? You remember
that you broke up with me?

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.888
Yeah, I know, Syd.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:47.456
But it sucks on
both sides, believe me.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:50.794
I feel like I come to these
relationships with my head bowed

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:55.164
waiting for someone to just chop my
neck, like I'm doing it on purpose.

01:13:55.198 --> 01:13:57.633
Syd, I'm sorry. I...

01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:00.036
You know, he's gotta eat.

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:12.148
I'm gonna take off.
Oh, no.

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.516
Why don't you stay?

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:16.119
Jake will be home soon,
and you can finally meet him.

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.987
No. And we can all
have dinner, yeah.

01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:21.057
No, I definitely think
I'm gonna skip that one.

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:22.325
Okay.

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:25.729
Hey. Hey, baby.

01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:27.563
One last question.

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:30.700
Um, this baby here,

01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:34.503
there's, uh, no way that he...

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:38.607
I had him almost two years
after we broke up, Sydney.

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:40.710
Do the math.

01:14:40.744 --> 01:14:42.846
I was never good at math.
Yeah.

01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:45.114
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:28.591
Bentley was a happy mantis.

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:32.361
He had a great job,
he kept himself in shape.

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:36.165
And when he met Tatiana, he knew
he had found his soul mate.

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:40.736
She had six long legs,
big, beautiful eyes,

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:45.474
and this sense of humor
that was just irresistible.

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:47.243
He loved her.

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:51.114
But sometimes, it seemed
that his love wasn't enough,

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:54.483
and that just made
him hold on tighter.

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:58.154
One day, Bentley came home
from a hard day's work,

01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:00.924
and he found
Tatiana waiting for him.

01:16:00.957 --> 01:16:05.428
She had this
strange glint in her eye.

01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:08.664
That night, the two made love.

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:10.633
It was beautiful.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:14.971
And when they finished,
Tatiana, she pulled him close,

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:17.841
she looked him
square in the eyes

01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:22.311
and then she began
to eat his head.

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:26.782
And as his last breath
escaped him, he wondered,

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.485
"Did he bring this
on himself?"

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:33.422
Of course, he would never be
able to answer that question.

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:35.624
He had no head.

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:40.396
That spring, Tatiana gave
birth to 107 baby mantises.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:46.135
"Twenty-seven survived."

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:50.373
And, uh, that's the end of the
story, so thank you guys so much.

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:59.182
Thank you. We sell any books?
Yeah, man.

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:01.717
Yes, we did.
We sold one copy, my friend.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.853
Doing good. Yeah.
Crushing it.

01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:07.623
I gotta bounce. Gotta pick up this
chick that works at the Planetarium.

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:09.425
Let me ask you this.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.594
Her little name tag says "NG" on it.
How would you say that?

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:14.730
I don't think there's a name there.
I think it's just silent.

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:16.499
I think you just nod to her.

01:17:16.532 --> 01:17:18.401
You're a weird guy.

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:22.605
Mmm.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.578
Sydney?

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:35.684
Hey. I, uh, didn't know
you were doing a reading.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:40.856
I just came in for a coffee,
and I heard your voice.

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:46.295
Decaf, soy latte, two pumps of
vanilla, lots of whipped cream?

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:49.098
Actually, back on the caffeine.

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:51.634
Life's too short for decaf, huh?

01:17:52.936 --> 01:17:57.040
So, how have you been?

01:17:57.073 --> 01:18:00.343
And please don't say "amazing,"
even if you have been.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:05.048
Definitely not amazing,
but I'm not too bad, either.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:07.984
You look great, of course.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.318
How are you?

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:12.288
Amazing.

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:16.993
I loved your story,
it was so funny.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:22.265
Can I ask, am I
the devouring lady mantis?

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:25.101
Tatiana the mantis
is an amalgamation

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:27.103
of a bunch of different people.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.105
Right.

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:32.241
Well, whatever it is,

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:36.245
I'm glad you got published.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:42.952
Sorry if I got a little bit Stalkery
McStalksalot a few months back.

01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:44.687
It was a tough couple of months.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.355
Yeah.

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:49.925
Here, take a book.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.794
Oh, I already have one.

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:53.462
I'm excited to read
the whole thing.

01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:56.832
Oh, you're the one
who bought it.

01:18:56.865 --> 01:19:00.469
You wanna finish the rest
of your coffee with me?

01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:05.708
This is "Flower Petal."

01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:13.549
"Take it Take it all, woman

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:17.820
"I am man,
and man must be strong

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:21.657
"In the depths of your wetness
Is where I belong

01:19:22.725 --> 01:19:25.028
"An oil well sprang forth

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:27.163
"The world
covered in my tar..."

01:19:27.196 --> 01:19:28.831
It's called The Vanity Press,

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:31.167
and you have to pay to get
your own work published.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.269
That's okay.
I mean, it's still in print.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.004
You can touch it.

01:19:35.038 --> 01:19:36.672
It's really what matters, right?

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:38.141
Yeah.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.910
What about you?

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:44.147
Um...

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.982
Well, I quit the bar.

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:48.484
It was about time.

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.653
Way past due.

01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:55.524
The show did really well, and
I sold a lot of paintings,

01:19:55.558 --> 01:19:58.661
so I just quit the next day.

01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:01.664
I have another one
coming up in Spain, actually.

01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:03.366
I leave next week.

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:05.234
Spain?
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:06.069 --> 01:20:08.104
With Sebastian, huh?

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:11.374
Yup. It's his gallery.

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:15.544
I have to ask you.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:19.014
Sebastian and you,
when we were dating,

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:21.117
did you, um...

01:20:21.884 --> 01:20:24.053
He's gay, Sydney.

01:20:25.188 --> 01:20:26.655
Sebastian's gay?

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:30.493
That explains
why he invited J.B.

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:34.497
to his ski chalet, I guess, huh?

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.865
I wonder if I should be offended
I never got the invite.

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:43.106
Spain, huh?
That's really cool.

01:20:43.139 --> 01:20:45.774
Yeah, I'm pretty
excited about it.

01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.643
You should be.

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:55.084
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:20:56.752 --> 01:20:58.754
It just

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:02.191
changed.

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:09.298
Oh, I have to go.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:17.406
It was really good seeing you.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.576
I think it was really
good to see you, too.

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:24.147
Bye.

01:21:25.648 --> 01:21:30.018
Hasta luego.
Have a good time in Spain.

01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:49.505
Remember that guy who said
it's better to have loved and lost?

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:53.242
Well, I still wanna
punch that guy in the face.

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:57.746
But the truth is he's right.

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:15.431
Because in spite
of all the bullshit,

01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:18.467
in spite of the desperation
and the pain,

01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:23.071
when it's great,
when it's really great,

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.274
it's all worth it.

01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:27.243
Excuse me.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.011
Hi. Sorry,
I don't wanna bother you.

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:32.215
I just wanted to tell you
your story is hilarious.

01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:34.250
I laughed my arse off.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.452
You are really funny.

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.688

you wanna join me?
