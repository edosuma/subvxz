00:21.642 --> 00:23.269
I'm GO Gwang-ryeol.

00:23.561 --> 00:24.144
What?

00:24.144 --> 00:25.563
Goni sent me.

00:25.980 --> 00:27.690
- You know my son?
- Yes.

00:27.690 --> 00:28.357
Goni?

00:29.817 --> 00:32.820
He sent this money.

00:33.153 --> 00:34.989
Our company can't run without him there.

00:35.573 --> 00:37.283
What company is that?

00:37.283 --> 00:39.326
You must be his uncle.

00:39.827 --> 00:40.661
What do you make?

00:40.661 --> 00:44.832
Well, we make ah...zapping batteries!

00:44.999 --> 00:46.041
Is that cash?

00:46.041 --> 00:46.834
Yes.

00:47.751 --> 00:49.211
Oh my!

00:49.336 --> 00:50.546
Must've made it big.

00:51.046 --> 00:52.131
I'll count it.

00:52.339 --> 00:53.966
Are you okay?

00:54.633 --> 00:56.552
- Get some pants.
- Okay.

00:59.346 --> 01:00.889
Dae-gil, stay inside.

01:00.889 --> 01:02.141
Tell me the truth...

01:02.141 --> 01:06.103
Damn it.

01:07.229 --> 01:09.773
Hi. Who are you?

01:13.319 --> 01:15.654
You're Goni's nephew, right?

01:15.654 --> 01:18.365
You look just like him! Come in.

01:18.365 --> 01:20.784
Handsome boy.

01:21.952 --> 01:22.995
What's your name?

01:22.995 --> 01:26.582
My last name was PARK,
then it changed to HAM Dae-gil.

01:26.582 --> 01:28.167
But my step dad died last year.

01:28.167 --> 01:30.169
My name could change again.

01:30.169 --> 01:31.545
Life is full of changes.

01:34.923 --> 01:36.425
Is that so?

01:37.926 --> 01:40.846
I'll give you some money.

01:43.307 --> 01:45.851
This is for listening to your mom.

01:46.018 --> 01:46.935
Thank you.

01:46.935 --> 01:47.936
And this...

01:48.020 --> 01:49.897
-for studying hard.
- Thank you.

01:49.897 --> 01:51.190
And this...

01:51.190 --> 01:52.650
for not fighting with friends.

01:52.650 --> 01:55.027
Right. Don't fight.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.362
For eating well.

01:57.488 --> 01:59.406
Right. Eat well.

01:59.406 --> 02:00.908
For not J-walking.

02:01.033 --> 02:05.663
Right. Don't J-walk.

02:05.663 --> 02:08.207
This kid's a hustler!

02:08.414 --> 02:10.501
- See you next time.
- Thank you!

02:14.922 --> 02:16.715
What's a hustler?

02:22.596 --> 02:24.765
It's almost time to go, so let's bet big.

02:25.015 --> 02:25.724
400 cards.

02:25.974 --> 02:29.228
We're eating out tonight, so let's end this.

02:29.687 --> 02:30.437
I'll see you.

02:31.397 --> 02:32.439
And raise you 600!

02:33.399 --> 02:34.066
I'll see you.

02:39.113 --> 02:40.322
And raise you 1000!

02:45.494 --> 02:46.954
Lend me 800 cards.

02:47.329 --> 02:49.081
80 cards interest, okay?

02:50.874 --> 02:52.251
Robot pair!

02:52.251 --> 02:55.087
Only the universe or water can beat robots!

02:55.087 --> 02:56.755
But there are no such cards!

02:56.755 --> 03:00.217
Thank you!

03:00.467 --> 03:01.760
Wait.

03:01.802 --> 03:04.388
Dying to eat out. What's the rush?

03:07.141 --> 03:08.434
Stupid!

03:08.434 --> 03:11.395
Doc can't beat a snail! Stupid!

03:11.395 --> 03:12.146
Stupid!

03:12.271 --> 03:13.772
Water beats robots, right?

03:21.071 --> 03:22.156
Sweat isn't water!

03:22.406 --> 03:23.741
Sweat isn't water!

03:26.034 --> 03:27.411
I want one...

03:28.412 --> 03:29.913

04:36.772 --> 04:39.316

04:39.316 --> 04:41.068
Just get a new player.

See you in a few days.

05:25.654 --> 05:30.075
So, you're the kid who's a hustler

What?

05:34.121 --> 05:36.874
Gwang-chul...bro.

05:37.624 --> 05:41.169
In gambling, money is king
and the better player rules

05:41.169 --> 05:43.922
Shit.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.552
Prepare to wet your pants, kid.

05:49.636 --> 05:50.721
Sure.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.235
7 pair! He wins again!

06:05.235 --> 06:06.278
Did I wet my pants?

06:06.987 --> 06:09.239
Out of cash already?

06:09.781 --> 06:11.825
Y'all got curfews?

06:12.367 --> 06:14.453
Shut up and deal.

06:14.494 --> 06:15.495
Sure man!

06:15.495 --> 06:16.580
Sure man

06:16.663 --> 06:19.750
See. Never seen this, huh

06:21.501 --> 06:23.879
Hurray, he's up to it again.

06:37.935 --> 06:40.437
Get your foot off me!

06:40.437 --> 06:41.939

Make money by honest work.

06:47.986 --> 06:49.696
Go to your room!

06:55.577 --> 06:57.621
Yes, I'll move the car.

06:57.621 --> 06:59.081
We walked here.

07:10.217 --> 07:11.426
You know me?

07:11.927 --> 07:13.011
First time seeing you.

07:14.471 --> 07:15.931
First time seeing a stranger?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.562
Just checking if I saw right.

07:24.815 --> 07:26.233
YUP, you're pretty.

What's your name?

07:35.158 --> 07:36.159
I'm HAM Dae-gil.

07:36.410 --> 07:37.244
Move.

07:37.327 --> 07:39.413
Gwang-chul's younger sister...

07:40.914 --> 07:41.540
named Gwang-sook?

07:41.748 --> 07:42.457
I'll start.

07:44.334 --> 07:45.085
What?

07:52.634 --> 07:54.344
What are you doing!

07:55.887 --> 07:59.850
Bro! Don't get me wrong!

08:16.074 --> 08:19.244
She's dang cute!

08:19.494 --> 08:23.040
There's a pretty girl in our town! Yes!

08:35.135 --> 08:37.721
How sweet!

08:37.721 --> 08:39.431
Bastards!

08:39.431 --> 08:42.642
Think I'm a sucker? This game is rigged!

08:42.642 --> 08:43.934
- You set me up!
- Shut up!

08:43.934 --> 08:47.689
Screw you! Know who my nephew is!

08:47.689 --> 08:49.983
You'll all rot in jail tonight!

08:49.983 --> 08:53.779
I saw you change cards!

08:53.779 --> 08:55.405
Call the cops!

08:57.032 --> 08:59.284
I'm sorry, sir!

08:59.367 --> 09:00.285
Sorry...

09:00.285 --> 09:04.414
Making me pound a man twice my age...

09:04.915 --> 09:06.041
Damn it.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.585
It's time I break your habit.

09:08.752 --> 09:10.670
- Take off your briefs.
- What?

09:10.670 --> 09:11.505
Strip naked.

09:11.838 --> 09:14.007
And stand here for a picture.

09:14.007 --> 09:15.383
Please! I'm sorry!

09:15.383 --> 09:17.260
You'll be even sorrier.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.970
I won't do it again!

09:18.970 --> 09:20.889
Cut the crap.

09:21.515 --> 09:22.933
Ghost speaking.

09:24.101 --> 09:24.976
Yes, Mr. JANG!

09:25.352 --> 09:26.436
No, sir.

09:26.895 --> 09:28.396
Hold on.

09:28.396 --> 09:32.442
If he's not naked when I'm back, you'll be.

09:32.442 --> 09:33.860
Yes, sir!

09:36.029 --> 09:37.280
Are you okay?

09:37.739 --> 09:38.532
Smiling?

09:39.449 --> 09:40.784
Son of a bitch!

09:40.784 --> 09:44.704
Take off your briefs or I'll crush your balls.

09:45.705 --> 09:47.707
Old bastard.

09:47.707 --> 09:50.293
Stand straight!

09:50.293 --> 09:51.086
Good.

09:51.211 --> 09:52.045
Head up.

09:52.295 --> 09:54.089
Not like that, fool!

09:54.089 --> 09:55.298
Good.

09:55.298 --> 09:57.676
One, two...

10:03.056 --> 10:03.682
Grandpa!

10:07.102 --> 10:08.770
I lost 60 grand.

10:09.271 --> 10:14.484
Your mom's savings. What do I do, Dae-gil

10:15.610 --> 10:16.862
First, get dressed.

10:17.112 --> 10:18.780
Let's talk at home.

10:19.197 --> 10:20.490
Let's go.

10:35.255 --> 10:37.090
Come on, asshole!

10:38.425 --> 10:39.217
A knife

10:43.096 --> 10:46.808
You're the Chinese food boy. Why you little!

10:47.058 --> 10:49.436
Get up! You fool!

10:58.153 --> 10:59.821
Son of a bitch...

11:13.627 --> 11:15.795
Let's go, Dae-gil!

11:16.963 --> 11:19.174
Let's run! Hurry!

11:20.842 --> 11:23.178
There's $6000 inside. Take it and run!

11:23.178 --> 11:27.390
He's not dead. Just stay low.

11:27.390 --> 11:31.102
Things happen in life.

11:31.186 --> 11:32.771
Don't worry.

11:32.771 --> 11:34.481
You'll get through this.

11:34.481 --> 11:36.900
It's okay. Stay healthy.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.860
It's okay.

11:38.860 --> 11:41.446
- I'm sorry, Mom.
-It's okay.

11:54.334 --> 11:55.669
Gwang-sook.

12:06.012 --> 12:06.721
Do it again?

12:06.721 --> 12:07.847
No, wait!

12:08.431 --> 12:09.391
Want my brother?

12:09.474 --> 12:10.850
No, I came to see you.

12:11.643 --> 12:12.519
For what?

12:13.728 --> 12:15.063
What's your real name?

12:18.358 --> 12:19.150
HUH Mina.

12:19.401 --> 12:20.235
HUH Mina, I love you.

12:20.527 --> 12:21.903
- Thanks.
- Hey, wait!

12:23.822 --> 12:28.118
Even if you liked me,
I suck now so it's no good.

12:29.202 --> 12:30.161
I'm leaving town.

12:31.037 --> 12:31.955
But...

12:32.289 --> 12:35.208
When we meet again, I'll be worth your while.

12:35.875 --> 12:36.751
If you wait...

12:37.419 --> 12:38.878
I'll come for you in style.

12:39.671 --> 12:40.797
Are you proposing?

12:42.465 --> 12:43.425
Yup.

12:43.508 --> 12:45.010
You're cute.

12:45.093 --> 12:46.428
- Wanna kiss?
- No.

12:46.428 --> 12:47.762
Next time, then.

12:48.305 --> 12:49.556
No problem.

12:49.806 --> 12:50.849
Stay healthy.

12:50.932 --> 12:51.808
HAM Dae-gil.

12:53.143 --> 12:55.061
Your zipper's down.

12:55.103 --> 12:56.438
You bowed to me.

12:59.316 --> 13:00.567
HUH Mina.

13:01.484 --> 13:05.030
I proposed to you! I'll come for you!

13:05.363 --> 13:07.115
Oops. Not here.

13:08.616 --> 13:09.909
You know what?

13:09.909 --> 13:11.494
You're so cute!

13:21.546 --> 13:23.715
Jjari! Heard you made it big!

13:23.923 --> 13:26.384
You're all I've got!

13:26.551 --> 13:27.344
Okay-

13:27.344 --> 13:28.595
Thank you!

13:28.595 --> 13:30.013
I gave you a good deal.

13:30.013 --> 13:31.765
It'll take me 3 hours.

13:32.432 --> 13:33.933
Wait for me!

13:34.225 --> 13:35.894
Thanks a lot!

13:36.519 --> 13:38.772
No need to thank me, man.

13:38.772 --> 13:41.608
Some people are born to make it.

13:41.608 --> 13:44.235
You should be driving a Benz and living large.

13:45.278 --> 13:46.738
A Benz sounds nice.

13:47.113 --> 13:48.114
When can I start

13:48.156 --> 13:49.282
Hold on, man.

13:49.282 --> 13:51.868
You taught me to play. I got your back.

13:53.495 --> 13:54.913
A Rolex

13:55.163 --> 13:56.873
Gangnam gambling houses must be hot.

13:56.915 --> 13:59.793
Gambling for work is hard.

13:59.793 --> 14:00.835
You said you stopped gambling.

14:02.045 --> 14:03.671
Just asking.

14:03.838 --> 14:05.840
Gambling's brutal here.

14:05.965 --> 14:07.467
No fun. Just money.

14:08.593 --> 14:11.262
Learning gambling from you back home was fun.

14:11.846 --> 14:13.723
- Bro
- What?

14:15.100 --> 14:16.810
Aren't you going back home?

14:16.810 --> 14:18.269
Why would I go back?

14:19.938 --> 14:20.688
You going back

14:23.316 --> 14:24.818
Not like this.

14:25.318 --> 14:27.737
I saw some nice buildings on the way.

14:27.862 --> 14:31.408
I'll buy one within 5 years
and give you a floor.

14:34.077 --> 14:35.078
For fun.

14:35.078 --> 14:37.914
Come on! At least give me half!

14:39.416 --> 14:42.836
Anyway, now that you're in Seoul, live it up!

14:43.294 --> 14:44.212
Here. Cheers!

14:44.629 --> 14:45.755
FIGHTING!

14:46.214 --> 14:49.217
And call me Charlie here.

14:49.217 --> 14:50.218
Drink it.

14:50.969 --> 14:54.264
You won't find a place here for this price.

14:54.264 --> 14:57.600
It's quiet with a good view.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.979
"MOVE UP NEXT YEAR!"

15:00.979 --> 15:04.732
"ME, TOO! MOVE UP NEXT YEAR!"

15:18.955 --> 15:20.123
Charlie!

15:21.332 --> 15:24.335
Why are you so late?

15:24.544 --> 15:25.795
Bought shoes?

15:27.630 --> 15:29.424
This is it?

15:29.674 --> 15:31.926
Let's start by parking.

15:31.926 --> 15:33.344
Hustlers park cars here

15:33.344 --> 15:35.180
The man in charge is out.

15:37.182 --> 15:38.475
Morning, sir.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.730
Where's SHIN?

15:43.730 --> 15:45.148
Out to collect, sir.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.442
Did you find a cook?

15:47.442 --> 15:50.445
It's hard to find the right person, sir.

15:50.445 --> 15:51.779
Greet him.

15:52.655 --> 15:53.615
Who's he?

15:53.615 --> 15:56.659
A hometown friend, sir. So many cars came.

15:56.784 --> 15:58.912
We can't let just anyone work here.

15:58.912 --> 16:02.081
He'll just help out today. Trust me, sir.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.877
Get to work.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.880
- Charlie Ramen noodles.
- Yes, sir.

16:10.673 --> 16:12.133
Cool. Who's that?

16:12.509 --> 16:13.593
He's Ggojang-

16:14.010 --> 16:14.802
What?

16:14.802 --> 16:16.304
The boss.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.974
Today's horoscope.

16:20.433 --> 16:23.228
A helper will come...

16:27.106 --> 16:28.858
Hope you like abalone, sir.

16:34.989 --> 16:37.158
Right amount of water.

16:39.661 --> 16:41.871
It's good.

16:43.164 --> 16:45.375
Ah, sir?

16:46.709 --> 16:48.169
I want to work here, sir.

16:51.047 --> 16:52.090
What's your name?

16:52.090 --> 16:54.300
HAM Dae-gil, sir.

16:55.802 --> 16:57.136
HAM Dae-gil.

16:57.470 --> 16:58.429
Nice name.

17:00.348 --> 17:01.724
Date of birth?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.768
November 4th, 1987, sir.

17:04.102 --> 17:05.435
A Scorpio.

17:05.728 --> 17:08.897
Scorpios are loyal and good at getting revenge.

17:09.691 --> 17:10.692
Give me your hand.

17:14.695 --> 17:17.531
Your palm lines look good. You're loyal.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.117
A man should be loyal.

17:21.868 --> 17:23.288
What did Jjari say about me?

17:24.329 --> 17:25.832
That you live on loyalty.

17:31.004 --> 17:32.297
Go get him.

17:33.381 --> 17:36.050
Boss is very picky with people,

17:36.050 --> 17:37.844
but it's cuz you're my friend.

17:37.844 --> 17:39.178
The hell

17:39.178 --> 17:41.264
He read that I'm a hustler.

17:41.848 --> 17:43.766
Who'd gamble here?

17:49.230 --> 17:52.609
It's like a real company here.

17:52.692 --> 17:55.361
We're raking in the dough.

17:57.864 --> 18:00.074
This is Chief SHIN, head of security.

18:00.074 --> 18:01.451
I'm HAM Dae-gil, sir.

18:01.451 --> 18:03.244
Security is everything here.

18:04.746 --> 18:06.748
Why so many crackdowns?

18:06.748 --> 18:08.207
Get the curtains

18:08.207 --> 18:08.958
US$50

18:10.335 --> 18:11.878
One, two, three, four.

18:11.961 --> 18:15.048
Old MacDonald

18:15.298 --> 18:16.924
had a farm

18:16.924 --> 18:19.677
E-I-E-I-O

18:19.677 --> 18:21.763
Stand hut! One, two!

18:36.027 --> 18:39.197
One by one, please!

18:39.197 --> 18:41.824
There's nothing here, inspector.

18:41.908 --> 18:43.326
Dropped your cigarettes

18:43.743 --> 18:44.994
Yup. It's mine.

18:45.328 --> 18:46.537
See ya.

18:46.537 --> 18:48.998
Let's just go! Your zipper's down.

18:51.417 --> 18:52.919
She's Madam Little.

18:52.919 --> 18:55.088
Sorry, Director LEE.

18:55.088 --> 19:00.009
She lends money and takes the vig here.

19:00.009 --> 19:01.969
- Know what a vig is?
- What?

19:02.220 --> 19:05.682
During their 6-hour slots,
some people run out early.

19:05.682 --> 19:07.141
- Then what?
- Thanks!

19:07.141 --> 19:10.978
- They get a loan from her.
- A loan, please.

19:10.978 --> 19:11.938
I'll pay you soon!

19:11.938 --> 19:15.149
- Win big!
- They borrow and borrow...

19:15.733 --> 19:17.527
and lose it completely.

19:17.527 --> 19:22.490
The customer who loses money is king here!

19:23.324 --> 19:24.325
Hello, sir.

19:24.325 --> 19:25.702
Why you!

19:26.285 --> 19:28.996
Think you're a hustler cuz I let you play lead

19:29.414 --> 19:31.999
Why didn't you close the door?

19:32.375 --> 19:33.418
Who's this?

19:33.418 --> 19:34.877
The new skivvy, sir.

19:40.758 --> 19:42.719
Acts so big. Who's he

19:42.719 --> 19:44.721
Chief SEO, the main player here.

19:45.972 --> 19:47.306
A Gangnam hustler?

19:47.306 --> 19:48.558
A total son of a bitch!

19:48.558 --> 19:52.562
I wanna crush him so bad!

19:53.354 --> 19:55.022
- Bro
- What

19:55.648 --> 19:57.608
What does a skivvy do?

19:57.608 --> 19:59.026
Two ramen! $100, please.

19:59.026 --> 19:59.736
Looks good!

19:59.736 --> 20:01.654
Dae-gil! Got a Dunhill?

20:03.906 --> 20:04.866
$20, please.

20:04.866 --> 20:07.785
$20 for just a pack of smokes

20:07.785 --> 20:10.204
Prices went up a lot these days, sir.

20:10.204 --> 20:12.165
- Give me two packs.
- Great!

20:12.165 --> 20:14.375
- Hurry!
- You take a stab.

20:14.792 --> 20:17.170
What's to think. A man should go straight!

20:17.170 --> 20:21.132
- Vitamin drinks here!
- Okay!

20:22.258 --> 20:25.428
$20 for <i>2</i> bottles but I'll give you 4 for $50!

20:25.428 --> 20:27.221
So cute!

20:27.221 --> 20:28.347
Cuz you're special.

20:28.347 --> 20:29.849
- Did you eat?
- Who cares?

20:29.849 --> 20:34.562
<i>- I'll</i> pay. I wanna give him a tip.
- No, I'll pay!

20:35.521 --> 20:38.024
Way to go.

21:27.365 --> 21:28.533
Boss wants you.

21:29.659 --> 21:31.327
How long did you work here?

21:31.536 --> 21:32.912
Almost 5 months, sir.

21:32.912 --> 21:34.580
Heard you played back home.

21:34.580 --> 21:36.582
The best in my town, sir.

21:36.582 --> 21:38.167
Some country suckers are coming,

21:38.167 --> 21:41.003
but SEO's appendix burst. Done.

21:41.546 --> 21:44.006
No need to borrow a player, right

21:47.009 --> 21:48.052
How about it?

21:52.598 --> 21:55.309
So sorry! I won again!

21:55.309 --> 21:58.271
Told 'ya rainy days are lucky!

21:58.271 --> 22:00.648
Damn noisy, I feel like puking.

22:00.857 --> 22:03.609
Then, take some pills.

22:03.651 --> 22:05.778
Hurry on up and deal!

22:06.404 --> 22:07.154
Bet.

22:07.154 --> 22:09.031
Oh, right! One, two, three...

22:09.031 --> 22:11.576
Three times the charm!

22:11.576 --> 22:12.910
Oh my!

22:14.871 --> 22:17.957
I'm on a roll!

22:18.958 --> 22:19.750
Hey!

22:19.750 --> 22:21.460
How many cards you got?

22:22.336 --> 22:23.296
Four, right

22:23.504 --> 22:25.256
You gave me six! See

22:25.923 --> 22:27.592
You dealt wrong.

22:27.758 --> 22:30.177
$1,000 for the mistake and start over!

22:32.638 --> 22:34.724
Deal right, will you?

22:34.849 --> 22:37.143
It's not your first time.

22:37.602 --> 22:39.520
Sorry. My mistake.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.772
It's okay. I had bad cards anyway.

22:41.772 --> 22:44.650
How about a break?

22:45.693 --> 22:47.194
Let me deal for once.

22:47.194 --> 22:51.574
Who cares who deals? I'll win anyway!

22:51.866 --> 22:53.075
Hurry up and deal!

22:53.075 --> 22:56.495
Hold your horses pal!

22:56.495 --> 22:59.707
Here! I bet $10,000.

23:03.085 --> 23:03.753
<i>7</i> points.

23:03.753 --> 23:04.420
9 points.

23:04.503 --> 23:05.296
You win.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.088
Seven pair.

23:06.213 --> 23:06.881
Eight pair!

23:06.881 --> 23:07.798
Stop!

23:07.965 --> 23:09.175
Let's play cards.

23:10.343 --> 23:12.428
It all adds up to 256 points!

23:12.553 --> 23:15.389
That's $25,600 each!

23:15.890 --> 23:17.934
Anyone need a loan?

23:24.857 --> 23:25.983
Seven points.

23:27.151 --> 23:28.653
Eight points.

23:29.779 --> 23:31.072
Six pair!

23:32.365 --> 23:33.908
Eight pair!

23:34.617 --> 23:36.452
One Go!

24:00.351 --> 24:03.688
Don't tell Jjari.

24:04.605 --> 24:05.898
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM!"

24:06.399 --> 24:08.693
- Nothing for me?
- Why you!

24:48.649 --> 24:50.651
Leaving already?

24:50.651 --> 24:52.778
You left your phone, Ms. WOO.

24:55.156 --> 24:55.906
What's wrong?

24:59.744 --> 25:02.621
You always win!

25:03.664 --> 25:04.498
Why are you crying?

25:04.498 --> 25:06.792
You always get the good cards!

25:06.792 --> 25:08.836
And take all the good cards, right before me!

25:08.836 --> 25:10.629
It's just a game. Don't cry!

25:11.630 --> 25:13.507
Stop it!

25:14.550 --> 25:15.885
Don't cry.

25:15.885 --> 25:17.470
Teach me how to play cards.

25:17.636 --> 25:18.220
What?

25:18.220 --> 25:20.097
You're a hustler. Please

25:20.848 --> 25:22.892
Please teach me!

25:22.892 --> 25:25.519
Teach me!

25:25.519 --> 25:26.687
Fine!

25:26.896 --> 25:28.105
I'll teach you everything.

25:28.105 --> 25:29.148
So stop!

25:30.399 --> 25:32.151
I'll buy drinks. Let's go.

25:32.151 --> 25:35.571
Let's drink, play cards, and talk

25:35.821 --> 25:38.282
I don't have any money...

25:38.282 --> 25:40.284
I have lots!

25:40.284 --> 25:42.620
How does wine sound?

25:43.537 --> 25:46.248
Wow, Ms. WOO!

25:47.500 --> 25:49.043
What's your name?

25:50.419 --> 25:51.087
Me

25:52.254 --> 25:52.922
WOO...

25:54.256 --> 25:55.466
Ji-yeon.

25:56.008 --> 25:56.592
HAM...

25:57.760 --> 25:59.011
Dae-gil.

26:02.306 --> 26:03.349
Seeing anyone

26:03.349 --> 26:05.726
Yes, of course.

26:06.685 --> 26:08.729
I'll get some beer.

26:09.647 --> 26:11.690
This is my lover.

26:15.194 --> 26:16.779
Shit.

26:17.238 --> 26:20.616
Like any man can resist you.

26:20.783 --> 26:22.118
Can I call you babe?

26:22.618 --> 26:27.456
I haven't met the right man,
so this is my lover.

26:43.013 --> 26:44.807
Do you love me?

27:12.960 --> 27:16.881
Do you love me?

27:19.008 --> 27:20.467
I love you.

28:23.280 --> 28:27.618
She's the easiest target. A rich widow.

28:27.618 --> 28:31.163
With the old man gone, she's living it up.

28:31.538 --> 28:32.873
How much is she worth?

28:33.082 --> 28:34.583
At least $10 million.

28:35.876 --> 28:38.170
- Who is?
- Ms. WOO.

28:39.755 --> 28:44.343
Let's set her up. Mind as well eat the cake
before someone else.

28:44.885 --> 28:46.762
How much is our goal?

28:46.804 --> 28:49.807
She could brush off $1 million as bad luck.

28:49.807 --> 28:53.477
$3 million should keep her from gambling again.

28:53.727 --> 28:54.853
Lesson learned.

28:55.896 --> 28:59.233
Fine, $3 million. Who'll play?

28:59.233 --> 29:02.569
I'll play and Madam Little can add to the pot.

29:02.695 --> 29:04.113
Will one player do?

29:04.113 --> 29:05.239
So, I was thinking...

29:07.950 --> 29:10.411
I think Dae-gil should play the lead.

29:11.495 --> 29:13.747
Women all love Dae-gil.

29:14.039 --> 29:16.583
Good looking, fun, with a big dick.

29:17.626 --> 29:18.335
Saw it?

29:18.544 --> 29:21.630
I can tell.

29:21.630 --> 29:24.049
The set up is best coming from someone close.

29:25.009 --> 29:27.052
Play by the book. What do you think?

29:29.179 --> 29:30.347
I think Jjari would be safer...

29:30.347 --> 29:31.098
No.

29:31.557 --> 29:33.058
SEO is right.

29:33.350 --> 29:37.938
The set up has to be perfect.
Next time, Charlie.

29:39.440 --> 29:40.816
Yes, sir.

29:41.066 --> 29:42.818
Who'll lure her in?

29:44.069 --> 29:45.654
Mrs. SONG is perfect.

29:46.613 --> 29:49.533
She's the one who first brought her here.

29:49.533 --> 29:53.454
She gambles so much,
she's about to lose her shop.

29:53.912 --> 29:57.624
WOO's close with her.
She won't suspect a thing.

29:57.624 --> 30:00.878
I love this game!

30:00.878 --> 30:05.257
She wants to raise the stakes.
She's asking to die.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.468
Then, so be it!

30:07.718 --> 30:09.762
Good acting, Dae-gil.

30:09.762 --> 30:11.430
Looking so worried.

30:11.430 --> 30:12.306
$100 grand!

30:12.348 --> 30:17.353
Win at first, then lose it all at the end.

30:20.939 --> 30:22.274
Nine pair.

30:24.860 --> 30:27.112
Don't sulk when others win!

30:27.112 --> 30:31.658
Wait! This is so heavy!

30:33.619 --> 30:36.747
When will we ever win?

30:36.747 --> 30:40.000
- Let's go get a massage.
- Sure!

30:40.000 --> 30:41.085
Wanna come

30:41.085 --> 30:43.170
Dang noisy!

30:53.305 --> 30:54.515
Thank you.

31:04.650 --> 31:06.777
Lose $400 grand more.

31:07.277 --> 31:10.280
If this job fails, we'll go under.

31:14.868 --> 31:15.869
Honey?

31:33.262 --> 31:34.680
Don't come here anymore.

31:35.681 --> 31:37.224
Did I win too much?

31:37.433 --> 31:39.685
They're losing to get to your money.

31:41.228 --> 31:42.229
Who?

31:46.984 --> 31:50.446
SEO, Madam Little, and Mrs. SONG.

31:50.946 --> 31:52.739
Why are you so naive?

31:53.907 --> 31:54.950
What about you?

31:58.078 --> 31:59.163
Don't come here.

31:59.955 --> 32:01.498
Then, nothing will happen.

32:14.887 --> 32:18.474
She hasn't shown in 3 weeks!

32:20.058 --> 32:22.102
Then, we won't get our cuts

32:22.394 --> 32:25.272
What if the bitch heard something?

32:27.774 --> 32:28.567
HAM Dae-gil.

32:30.277 --> 32:31.069
Yes

32:32.529 --> 32:33.405
I...

32:35.574 --> 32:37.451
want ramen noodles.

32:39.036 --> 32:40.078
Dae-gil!

32:40.078 --> 32:42.122
She's here! Go in!

32:42.122 --> 32:44.791
- Go on! Hurry!
- Who

32:44.791 --> 32:47.503
Give me that.

32:47.836 --> 32:49.046
Go get her!

32:52.007 --> 32:55.802
Learn to play from me.

32:55.802 --> 32:59.348
Mrs. SONG never stops...

33:04.061 --> 33:06.104
This is getting boring.

33:06.647 --> 33:08.565
Let me deal for a change.

33:12.277 --> 33:14.279
Can I bet $2 million?

33:17.741 --> 33:18.825
Now!!

33:20.661 --> 33:21.912
End it here.

33:24.081 --> 33:25.415
Change cards.

33:30.837 --> 33:31.880
Let's play-

33:33.840 --> 33:34.800
$100,000 on 'lo.

33:35.133 --> 33:37.344
I bet $100,000 on 6.

33:37.344 --> 33:39.304
If I die, don't play at my funeral.

33:39.638 --> 33:40.639
$700,000 on 5!

33:42.015 --> 33:44.059
What if you lose big?

33:44.059 --> 33:46.144
We'll see about that.

33:46.144 --> 33:47.479
Dae-gil?

33:51.942 --> 33:53.318
$100,000 on 6.

33:53.527 --> 33:57.030
Okay. Lady luck.

33:57.030 --> 33:58.031
Let's win!

33:58.699 --> 34:02.578
- Come to mama!
- Chief SEO, pass the lighter

34:02.578 --> 34:06.456
Forget the lighter, how's this?

34:06.456 --> 34:08.875
Cool!

34:12.795 --> 34:15.257
I should've bet $700,000.

34:15.591 --> 34:17.967
9 points.

34:18.802 --> 34:20.846
Looks good.

34:20.846 --> 34:23.431
Okay, there.

34:24.474 --> 34:25.225
9 points, too.

34:25.225 --> 34:28.895
I got seven pair.

34:28.895 --> 34:29.688
Seven pair!

34:30.355 --> 34:32.315
She'll buy a building!

34:32.565 --> 34:33.817
Come on...

34:34.525 --> 34:35.152
One...

34:35.402 --> 34:36.570
Three...

34:37.112 --> 34:41.199
What? 9 pair

34:41.617 --> 34:42.326
Oh my!

34:42.576 --> 34:44.411
I got a 9 pair!

34:44.411 --> 34:45.286
Look!

34:46.246 --> 34:47.414
Oh my!

34:47.748 --> 34:49.708
I won! I'm rich!

34:51.877 --> 34:54.588
I told you I'm lucky here!

35:08.185 --> 35:09.936
No word from Ms. WOO

35:10.020 --> 35:11.813
Of course not.

35:12.606 --> 35:16.860
The boss lost everything. He's screwed.

35:17.611 --> 35:19.655
Where's SEO these days?

35:19.655 --> 35:21.948
He's out gambling to help the boss.

35:22.199 --> 35:23.617
So stupid.

35:23.617 --> 35:27.871
Acting so big, but losing to a dang girl.

35:28.580 --> 35:30.207
Any place I can gamble, too?

35:30.999 --> 35:33.251
It's hard to win on others' turf.

35:37.172 --> 35:39.800
But I know this one rich fool.

35:40.175 --> 35:42.636
You came a long way. I'm JANG Dong-shik.

35:42.636 --> 35:43.929
This way, please.

35:44.262 --> 35:48.266
He used to be famous in his hay days.

35:48.266 --> 35:49.393
For what?

35:49.810 --> 35:51.228
Crimes of course.

35:51.228 --> 35:54.898
- Hit me!
- You bitch!

35:55.774 --> 35:59.319
The people are nice here. Very kind.

35:59.444 --> 36:01.154
They're...

36:09.371 --> 36:11.790
You're their bodyguard

36:13.500 --> 36:14.793
Worried about your winnings

36:15.669 --> 36:17.337
We don't pull that shit.

36:17.421 --> 36:19.798
Have some coffee in the next room.

36:19.798 --> 36:21.299
No use standing and watching.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.345
The new kid's good.

36:25.595 --> 36:27.222
- KIM!
- Yes

36:30.684 --> 36:31.643
Go

36:32.060 --> 36:33.061
Wait there.

36:39.985 --> 36:42.070
Come on in!

36:42.612 --> 36:44.740
Is someone else joining?

36:46.241 --> 36:51.079
My niece wanted to play.

36:51.288 --> 36:52.914
You'll like her.

36:52.914 --> 36:54.624
She's really pretty.

36:57.210 --> 36:58.712
Come in.

37:04.926 --> 37:06.094
Sit down.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.066
Know each other?

37:20.192 --> 37:20.984
You know me?

37:25.155 --> 37:26.323
No.

37:28.074 --> 37:29.701
First time seeing a stranger.

37:31.828 --> 37:32.788
I told you she's pretty.

37:35.081 --> 37:37.042
I'm Charlie from Gangnam. And you?

37:37.167 --> 37:39.294
They call me Gwang-sook.

37:39.419 --> 37:40.629
Okay!

37:40.629 --> 37:42.589
Now that we're all acquainted...

37:43.131 --> 37:45.425
Let's set the rules.

37:45.759 --> 37:46.802
Share the winnings

37:46.802 --> 37:49.221
- Sure. Whatever.
- Wait.

37:49.387 --> 37:51.890
Why share the winnings. We're not friends.

37:52.349 --> 37:53.350
You know me?

37:53.350 --> 37:56.645
Fine. How about a cap?

37:56.686 --> 37:57.395
What?

37:57.395 --> 38:00.023
Limited or unlimited liability
to major winnings

38:00.065 --> 38:00.941
Unlimited!

38:04.110 --> 38:08.615
Such a manly young man!

38:09.783 --> 38:13.537
Shall we start with $10 a point

38:13.537 --> 38:15.205
Let's begin.

38:22.879 --> 38:23.547
I fold.

38:30.762 --> 38:31.888
Shit.

38:34.641 --> 38:37.644
Losing big from the start...

38:37.644 --> 38:39.271
How about $20 a point?

38:39.855 --> 38:41.064
Why not.

38:57.372 --> 38:58.290
$50 a point.

39:07.841 --> 39:09.759
Damn it!

39:11.177 --> 39:13.263
$100 a point. Okay?

39:13.763 --> 39:15.557
Where's the bathroom?

39:17.559 --> 39:18.727
Dae-gil.

39:19.728 --> 39:20.729
What?

39:21.646 --> 39:23.398
We won lots, let's stop.

39:26.943 --> 39:29.070
Don't worry and follow my lead.

39:33.074 --> 39:36.328
Damn. When will I win big?

39:36.953 --> 39:38.121
Cut the deck good.

39:42.751 --> 39:43.710
That reeks.

39:45.003 --> 39:46.880
Did you shit your pants?

39:58.808 --> 40:00.310
It doesn't stink.

40:00.310 --> 40:01.603
Then, what's this stench?

40:01.603 --> 40:03.480
It doesn't smell!

40:03.480 --> 40:04.648
Dang.

40:05.482 --> 40:07.567
Sucks. I fold.

40:13.657 --> 40:14.282
Yes!

40:14.991 --> 40:16.076
I'm on a roll!

40:28.296 --> 40:30.131
Oh my!

40:30.882 --> 40:31.633
One card each, please

40:32.884 --> 40:33.802
One Go!

40:50.568 --> 40:51.945
Two Go!

40:54.322 --> 40:55.657
Let's go!

41:06.334 --> 41:09.504
This quadruples my points.

41:17.929 --> 41:18.888
Three Go!

41:41.453 --> 41:42.162
Four Go!

41:56.968 --> 41:58.636
Shit.

41:59.679 --> 42:00.680
Doesn't look good.

42:08.438 --> 42:09.397
Five Go!

42:25.121 --> 42:26.956
Let's do this.

42:27.290 --> 42:31.544
$1 million divided by 12 months.

42:32.128 --> 42:38.927
That comes to around $82,000 a month each.

42:39.886 --> 42:44.849
Not too bad for young men like you. Right.

42:44.849 --> 42:46.893
SHIN!

42:46.893 --> 42:47.977
KIM!

42:47.977 --> 42:51.564
- SHIN!
- KIM!

42:51.564 --> 42:52.440
SHIN!

43:00.031 --> 43:01.282
Yes, boss

43:04.786 --> 43:06.454
Go bring the thing.

43:07.205 --> 43:09.624
"LOU"

43:10.458 --> 43:14.087
Ever heard of WANG, who tried to run from me

43:14.629 --> 43:16.089
He lost his you know what.

43:17.465 --> 43:18.883
I'll pay you, sir.

43:26.933 --> 43:29.727
An eye for an eye.

43:29.978 --> 43:33.022
How dare he play his boss for a fool.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.819
He's lucky we didn't break his bones.

43:38.403 --> 43:40.530
I appreciate your help.

43:41.364 --> 43:43.199
Thank you.

43:44.659 --> 43:46.578
It was fun.

43:46.578 --> 43:50.623
It'll be a month soon. Think he'll pay up

43:55.086 --> 43:59.048
I'll squeeze it out of him.

44:27.452 --> 44:29.245
Who are you bastards!

44:38.796 --> 44:41.049
Mom I'll call you later.

44:41.174 --> 44:43.134
Get the kidney as usual.

44:43.259 --> 44:44.636
Let's do it.

45:00.568 --> 45:02.362
My hand!

45:07.116 --> 45:08.117
Shit...

45:17.752 --> 45:20.046
Up already

45:20.255 --> 45:21.089
You okay

45:21.089 --> 45:23.341
What the hell did you do!

45:23.341 --> 45:24.425
What's with his hand?

45:24.759 --> 45:26.594
Hit it on the way.

45:27.262 --> 45:29.722
How can I get my money with him like that?

45:30.098 --> 45:34.269
Just drug him up and give him to the bitches.

45:34.269 --> 45:35.603
I'll kill you!

45:46.823 --> 45:49.993
Only to here. Perfect.

45:51.202 --> 45:54.539
Don't strain yourself and listen.

45:55.081 --> 45:57.417
Your apartment and accounts...

45:57.417 --> 46:02.005
and the kidney paid for 2 months.

46:02.380 --> 46:03.631
Get better.

46:03.965 --> 46:06.926
Take this if it hurts.

46:08.344 --> 46:09.804
It works well.

46:12.515 --> 46:14.350
<i>I'll get you!</i>

46:19.814 --> 46:21.357
Hope you don't run off.

46:21.816 --> 46:23.526
Try if you dare.

46:24.819 --> 46:27.363
Give him an IV to heal faster.

46:27.739 --> 46:28.573
Okay-

46:28.573 --> 46:30.825
How long till he can go?

46:30.825 --> 46:33.661
I'll send him out next week.

46:35.913 --> 46:38.916
Make sure you get everyone. Here he comes.

46:39.751 --> 46:41.294
On the van, now!

46:41.294 --> 46:43.421
Boss won't be out for a while.

46:43.421 --> 46:46.924
SEO and Madame Little went into hiding, too.

46:46.924 --> 46:48.926
Stay low till I call you.

46:50.678 --> 46:52.430
And watch out for JANG.

47:11.199 --> 47:13.368
- Are you done
- Yes.

47:34.555 --> 47:37.141
Get up. JANG's men are coming.

47:46.275 --> 47:47.693
This place is good.

47:48.736 --> 47:50.571
No smoking!

47:51.030 --> 47:52.031
We're done.

47:57.328 --> 47:59.664
Got one.

48:08.881 --> 48:10.049
Shit.

48:13.761 --> 48:17.682
Wanna go some place nice to talk

48:19.392 --> 48:20.518
How about the sea

48:21.436 --> 48:23.187
You're on the run.

48:24.188 --> 48:25.940
But I'm tied down.

48:30.987 --> 48:31.654
What's this?

48:31.988 --> 48:33.072
It's yours.

48:40.204 --> 48:42.206
Money from selling you out.

48:43.458 --> 48:44.625
It's yours now.

48:48.504 --> 48:49.338
What?

48:49.755 --> 48:51.132
It's from scamming you.

48:54.343 --> 48:58.598
You got cleaned out by JANG.

49:01.058 --> 49:02.768
Cut the deck good.

49:04.937 --> 49:06.481
Did you shit your pants?

49:07.023 --> 49:08.816
What happened before the cut?

49:10.985 --> 49:14.071
Didn't you learn if a girl shows her underwear,
they'll trick ya?

49:14.614 --> 49:15.740
Jjari...

49:17.366 --> 49:18.951
He was watching.

49:18.951 --> 49:20.578
Stupid.

49:21.037 --> 49:23.539
Jjari's the one who changed cards for JANG!

49:24.415 --> 49:29.045
Stay low till I call you.

49:29.045 --> 49:30.963
Watch out for JANG.

49:42.892 --> 49:45.686
Call JANG Dong-shik now!

49:45.895 --> 49:47.271
If you call him, you're dead.

49:48.147 --> 49:49.357
I don't care.

49:50.733 --> 49:51.692
Think I'm a loser

49:53.277 --> 49:54.362
Shit! Call him!

49:54.529 --> 49:56.531
I don't have a phone! Call him!

49:56.531 --> 49:58.199
Now!!

49:59.825 --> 50:00.910
Is it here?

50:01.244 --> 50:02.495
Where is it

50:03.162 --> 50:04.247
Where's the phone!

50:05.998 --> 50:07.250
You covering him

50:14.590 --> 50:15.466
Look“.

50:17.426 --> 50:19.345
I just saved your life.

50:20.721 --> 50:22.765
Sons of bitches!

50:25.685 --> 50:27.353
Bastards!

50:34.151 --> 50:35.444
Don't look for me.

50:36.153 --> 50:38.364
If we're meant to meet, we will.

50:40.116 --> 50:41.742
Why are you doing this?

50:42.702 --> 50:46.205
Can't let a guy who proposed just die.

50:49.709 --> 50:52.003
If this is for saving my life...

50:52.920 --> 50:55.548
Then, my life is yours.

51:04.473 --> 51:06.100
The hell

51:19.238 --> 51:20.573
Son of a bitch!

51:20.573 --> 51:24.493
Think you can pull one on me!

51:24.493 --> 51:26.912
What the hell!

51:27.830 --> 51:29.540
Crazy asshole!

51:30.541 --> 51:31.959
Think I'd like the 9 pair

51:32.043 --> 51:34.795
Then, he must have an 8 pair.

51:34.795 --> 51:36.714
I knew it! So predictable.

51:36.714 --> 51:38.841
You have the 10 pair to clean us out, huh

51:38.841 --> 51:40.801
- Let go!
- Hold still!

51:40.801 --> 51:44.388
Know what happens when you're caught cheating!

51:44.388 --> 51:46.724
I didn't cheat!

51:46.807 --> 51:49.226
Mister. Open his cards.

51:49.352 --> 51:50.478
See his hand

51:51.062 --> 51:54.774
With the 10 pair, you'll end up like him!

51:55.816 --> 51:56.734
It's 10 points.

51:58.861 --> 52:00.571
Then, what about yours?

52:00.696 --> 52:01.614
Mine

52:02.657 --> 52:03.699
Just <i>2</i> points.

52:04.950 --> 52:06.243
Let me see your hands!

52:06.243 --> 52:07.828
What? This?

52:08.079 --> 52:09.872
It can't be.

52:10.331 --> 52:11.540
Please.

52:13.292 --> 52:16.629
Us gamblers should trust each other and play.

52:16.629 --> 52:20.508
Too bad about your cards. This game's a bust.

52:20.675 --> 52:23.719
I'm too scared to play here. Good luck!

52:31.310 --> 52:32.395
Mister!

52:35.856 --> 52:37.066
Mister!

52:39.652 --> 52:40.611
Me?

52:40.736 --> 52:42.613
Why? What's up?

52:42.613 --> 52:44.031
Why'd you help me?

52:44.031 --> 52:46.784
Helped you No way.

52:46.784 --> 52:48.160
See ya.

52:49.286 --> 52:51.205
You changed my pair.

52:51.372 --> 52:52.331
Are you a hustler?

52:52.373 --> 52:57.712
That's crazy! I'm just a factory worker.

52:57.712 --> 52:58.838
Bye.

52:58.838 --> 53:00.047
What do you make?

53:00.673 --> 53:03.801
Why do I have to tell you?

53:03.801 --> 53:09.265
I work at a factory for ah...zapping batteries!

53:09.265 --> 53:11.142
Now, move!

53:11.517 --> 53:13.102
Freeze!

53:15.271 --> 53:18.190
Just as I expected.

53:18.190 --> 53:20.109
Told ya they're fishy.

53:20.109 --> 53:20.901
Time to pay!

53:21.944 --> 53:24.071
Guess this can look suspicious.

53:24.071 --> 53:25.865
You deserve a beating!

53:25.865 --> 53:28.743
It's a misunderstanding!

53:29.493 --> 53:30.828
Good job.

53:31.495 --> 53:32.329
What's this?

53:32.329 --> 53:34.081
Get them!

53:34.081 --> 53:37.918
- No! I don't know him!
- Come here!

53:38.169 --> 53:42.715
Stop running! If I catch you, you're dead!

53:43.007 --> 53:46.385
If you wear my only sweats, what do I wear?

53:46.469 --> 53:48.095
I've been thinking.

53:48.095 --> 53:50.931
Aren't you leaving? You said you'll go.

53:50.931 --> 53:52.475
How about being partners?

53:52.808 --> 53:55.394
Why be partners with a cripple like me?

53:55.561 --> 53:57.646
I have a good feeling.

53:57.855 --> 53:59.398
Don't have anywhere to go?

54:01.692 --> 54:05.362
Don't worry. I used to play in Gangnam houses.

54:05.529 --> 54:07.656
If you don't believe me, try me.

54:11.994 --> 54:13.204
What's with your hand?

54:14.121 --> 54:15.623
It's nothing.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.084
Cut the deck.

54:22.505 --> 54:23.923
Where are you from?

54:24.131 --> 54:25.007
Why?

54:25.007 --> 54:27.301
You remind me of someone.

54:28.719 --> 54:29.553
Who?

54:32.014 --> 54:33.933
Someone with a stormy life.

54:35.142 --> 54:37.353
They're always at it!

54:37.853 --> 54:40.773
How can they live like that?

54:49.490 --> 54:50.324
Open our cards

54:51.742 --> 54:53.285
What's the use?

54:53.327 --> 54:54.995
You're a hustler all right!

54:55.496 --> 54:56.372
10 pair.

54:56.622 --> 54:57.748
Accept your loss?

55:00.501 --> 55:03.921
Try switching to your left hand.

55:03.921 --> 55:06.257
Kids can sneak bottom cards better.

55:06.757 --> 55:07.591
You saw?

55:07.591 --> 55:11.178
Don't have to. I could hear it.

55:11.178 --> 55:14.265
Anyway, you lost. We're partners.

55:14.598 --> 55:16.183
Open my cards.

55:18.978 --> 55:22.147
My hand was cut with the 9 pair.

55:23.315 --> 55:26.819
But my partner saved my life on just 3 points.

55:27.862 --> 55:30.739
Sometimes 1 point can win a 10 pair.

55:34.201 --> 55:35.578
It's been 3 days.

55:37.288 --> 55:38.539
I've been thinking.

55:38.539 --> 55:40.165
What's to think about!

55:40.249 --> 55:41.876
Please be my teacher.

55:42.585 --> 55:44.628
Not partners, okay?

55:44.628 --> 55:46.463
You always talk so much

55:47.047 --> 55:48.465
You'll be my secret master.

55:48.465 --> 55:51.886
They always die cuz of their disciples.

55:52.177 --> 55:53.929
If you die, I'll get revenge.

55:54.847 --> 55:58.601
I'll drop you off at the bus terminal up ahead.

55:58.601 --> 55:59.935
Hey!

56:00.352 --> 56:02.271
Why you!

56:02.271 --> 56:05.566
Just practicing hand tricks won't work!

56:05.566 --> 56:07.985
Watch it!

56:08.903 --> 56:10.487
You said to use my left.

56:10.487 --> 56:11.363
Why you!

56:11.363 --> 56:15.200
You always get crushed cuz you play
with your hands!

56:15.200 --> 56:18.120
- Then, play with my feet
- With your heart!

56:18.120 --> 56:23.000
Read the people, not the cards.
Read their minds.

56:23.417 --> 56:26.295
Hustlers can predict...

56:31.300 --> 56:34.303
My horoscope warned of someone jumping
into my life.

56:34.803 --> 56:38.891
Bad news. Gotta change all four tires.

56:38.891 --> 56:40.601
Or else you'll die!

56:40.601 --> 56:43.062
If they think they found a sucker...

56:43.354 --> 56:45.481
their lips curl up.

56:45.481 --> 56:46.565
It's an old car...

56:46.565 --> 56:51.612
When they're eyebrows curl...
they're testing you out.

56:51.612 --> 56:53.697
It'll cost $5000.

56:53.697 --> 56:55.616
If they avoid eye contact?

56:56.075 --> 56:56.784
It's a lie!

56:56.784 --> 56:59.078
I'll do it for $4000 cash with free waxing.

56:59.078 --> 57:01.789
Enough with the basics, give me more!

57:01.789 --> 57:03.374
Could you look at my tires

57:03.374 --> 57:05.417
- Coming...
- More Sure!

57:05.834 --> 57:08.587
The pupils. The eyes can't lie.

57:08.587 --> 57:10.839
They get bigger when excited.

57:11.131 --> 57:12.091
You played cards again!

57:12.091 --> 57:15.636
And shrivel up at what they hate,
like your dick.

57:16.136 --> 57:20.057
Then, why do you get scammed,
knowing he's lying

57:20.057 --> 57:21.934
I never get scammed.

57:22.685 --> 57:24.395
Shit.

57:24.728 --> 57:26.647
Why hello!

57:27.272 --> 57:29.233
Just the waxing left, sir.

57:29.733 --> 57:31.527
Take your time.

57:32.403 --> 57:33.696
Playing cards

57:35.489 --> 57:36.991
Can you play cards?

57:36.991 --> 57:39.994
Wait! You can't leave yet!

57:39.994 --> 57:41.870
I have to get going. Why?

57:41.870 --> 57:44.498
The game's over. You want more tip

57:44.498 --> 57:46.834
Who plays cards for tips?

57:47.376 --> 57:49.962
How about raising the stakes for another game

57:49.962 --> 57:52.339
I'm no gambler. No way!

57:55.342 --> 57:56.802
Man!

57:57.761 --> 57:59.304
You lost a lot today.

57:59.304 --> 58:02.891
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

58:03.392 --> 58:05.561
Your nephew is really good.

58:05.561 --> 58:07.396
Just luck.

58:16.447 --> 58:18.157
Lend me the DuPont.

58:21.535 --> 58:22.953
"Dull

58:22.953 --> 58:24.038
Du

58:24.955 --> 58:28.042
- Like in Adieu!
- Funny.

58:30.419 --> 58:31.295
What?

58:31.420 --> 58:32.755
There's a card missing!

58:33.422 --> 58:35.632
Someone must've hid one!

58:36.050 --> 58:38.802
This is not good!

58:38.802 --> 58:40.554
Everyone, hands up!

58:40.554 --> 58:43.057
Flip them! No card?

58:43.057 --> 58:45.809
Then, shake them! No?

58:45.809 --> 58:50.522
Then, look on the floor! Not there?

58:50.522 --> 58:53.984
Then, buy new cards.

58:54.985 --> 58:56.278
Go buy a new pack.

58:56.695 --> 58:57.863
"CLOSED TODAY"

58:57.863 --> 59:00.574
I didn't win much. Why call me again?

59:00.657 --> 59:01.784
Have a seat.

59:01.784 --> 59:03.827
We sit here?

59:04.411 --> 59:09.083
It's as if we've been set up to sit here, huh?

59:12.961 --> 59:15.881
Just kidding!

59:15.881 --> 59:18.884
It's not where you sit, but how you play, right

59:19.134 --> 59:21.637
Oh, the car out front is getting towed.

59:21.637 --> 59:25.432
- Number 6784. Go after it!
- Damn!

59:25.557 --> 59:27.267
Run!

59:27.684 --> 59:30.020
Uncle. Can I sit there?

59:30.020 --> 59:32.940
Sure! It's not like there's a surveillance cam.

59:34.900 --> 59:36.735
Camera 1 is out.

59:36.735 --> 59:39.488
Not my day today!

59:41.031 --> 59:45.202
It's dry in here. Can I turn on a humidifier?

59:45.786 --> 59:49.498
I have a sore throat. I need this thing.

59:49.498 --> 59:51.041
It's a humidifier.

59:54.878 --> 59:58.090
Why are you all like this?

01:00:06.682 --> 01:00:07.558
US$1,000

01:00:08.934 --> 01:00:11.103
I'll see that and raise you $2000.

01:00:11.228 --> 01:00:12.187
Raise you $4000.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:13.689
US$8,000

01:00:14.565 --> 01:00:15.274
All in.

01:00:16.608 --> 01:00:17.401
Okay-

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:18.443
Check!

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:20.320
Eight pair.

01:00:24.199 --> 01:00:25.534
Wait!

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.286
Nine pair.

01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:39.548
Bring lots of money.

01:00:41.508 --> 01:00:42.593
Hello everyone!

01:00:42.759 --> 01:00:45.387
Where'd you get all that money?

01:00:45.387 --> 01:00:49.349
Have a seat anywhere. Want us to move seats?

01:00:50.184 --> 01:00:52.060
A new table?

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.063
Before we start, I'll charge my phone

01:00:55.063 --> 01:00:56.940
- Should've done it before.
- Sorry.

01:00:57.024 --> 01:01:00.944
Dae-gil! Pull that out and plug in my phone.

01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:05.616
You got one kidney, that's good for you.

01:01:05.616 --> 01:01:07.910
Gotta keep healthy to gamble.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.953
Enough ﬂagging-

01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:12.331
And quit smoking!

01:01:15.334 --> 01:01:17.836
Isn't it time we play in bigger pools

01:01:18.003 --> 01:01:20.964
Think you're good cuz you beat a few suckers

01:01:20.964 --> 01:01:22.633
Didn't you see me crush a hustler?

01:01:22.758 --> 01:01:23.717
What hustler?

01:01:23.842 --> 01:01:28.263
The one with small eyes. Looks just like you.

01:01:28.263 --> 01:01:31.892
Hustlers with big eyes can be read by others.

01:01:31.892 --> 01:01:34.728
When I started out, I had big eyes like you.

01:01:34.728 --> 01:01:37.773
You look exactly like me back then.

01:01:37.773 --> 01:01:38.815
Totally!

01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:41.068
Shit!

01:01:41.568 --> 01:01:43.070
Why is that shit!

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:45.447
My eyes have evolved.

01:01:45.447 --> 01:01:46.657
They've deteriorated!

01:01:46.657 --> 01:01:49.284
No way! I can see everything fine!

01:01:59.503 --> 01:02:00.545
What?

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:03.382
Thank you, sir.

01:02:03.548 --> 01:02:06.093
Nice acting.

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:08.762
Your partner's good.

01:02:08.762 --> 01:02:10.138
He's my disciple.

01:02:10.138 --> 01:02:12.099
It's an honor, sir.

01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:16.520
I'm Dark Knight from Ansan.

01:02:16.895 --> 01:02:19.564
I'm Mr. GO. See you around.

01:02:19.564 --> 01:02:20.899
Yes, sir.

01:02:21.858 --> 01:02:24.861
Watch your wrist and may the kings be with you.

01:02:24.861 --> 01:02:26.905
- The kings be with you.
- Bye.

01:02:37.207 --> 01:02:41.837
At times, enemies can be friends
and friends enemies.

01:02:41.837 --> 01:02:42.963
Get it

01:02:43.213 --> 01:02:44.423
- Sir
- What

01:02:45.257 --> 01:02:46.174
I respect you.

01:02:46.174 --> 01:02:47.467
Why you.

01:02:48.176 --> 01:02:50.554
There are two types in gambling.

01:02:50.554 --> 01:02:53.223
The loser and the winner.

01:02:53.724 --> 01:02:55.934
No need for words.

01:02:56.143 --> 01:02:59.813
I know! Cuz the money and cards talk.

01:02:59.813 --> 01:03:00.939
What's a sucker?

01:03:00.939 --> 01:03:02.899
- The king!
- Good!

01:03:03.734 --> 01:03:05.569
What a nice day.

01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:07.654
Pack up! Let's go play with flowers!

01:03:07.654 --> 01:03:09.323
Where to, sir?

01:03:09.323 --> 01:03:12.784
- Wherever the cards lead us!
- After you!

01:03:13.076 --> 01:03:14.202
Stop!

01:03:14.202 --> 01:03:15.162
Let's see.

01:03:15.162 --> 01:03:17.956
Double on 8 points.

01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:21.835
And I called 'Go' 3 times.

01:03:21.835 --> 01:03:26.423
No, 5 times with all 5 kings!
You'll need more cash.

01:03:26.423 --> 01:03:29.092
The young man cleaned us out!

01:03:32.846 --> 01:03:33.555
Who cares!

01:03:33.555 --> 01:03:34.973
I bet everything!

01:03:35.682 --> 01:03:37.267
Open!

01:03:37.267 --> 01:03:42.022
Open the cards!

01:03:47.903 --> 01:03:49.488
I have a question.

01:03:49.488 --> 01:03:50.155
What?

01:03:50.155 --> 01:03:52.199
Let's say you have to play naked.

01:03:52.616 --> 01:03:55.869
But you have to hide a card.

01:03:56.036 --> 01:03:57.245
What do you do?

01:03:57.662 --> 01:03:58.872
Eat it.

01:03:59.289 --> 01:04:01.875
It's plastic. How can you eat it

01:04:01.875 --> 01:04:03.668
There's nothing a hustler can't eat!

01:04:03.668 --> 01:04:05.253
A hustler ain't no dog!

01:04:05.587 --> 01:04:06.671
Did you ever eat it?

01:04:06.838 --> 01:04:08.799
I'm no dog. Why would I?

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.515
What's going on?

01:04:21.603 --> 01:04:22.813
Jjari!

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.316
Dae-gil...

01:04:26.441 --> 01:04:27.275
Long time no see.

01:04:27.442 --> 01:04:28.402
What's up?

01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:30.237
How have you been?

01:04:30.237 --> 01:04:33.031
Good. I'm late for something.

01:04:33.031 --> 01:04:35.033
<i>- I'll</i> go with you!
-It's okay!

01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:42.207
Bastard! Leave me alone!

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:43.166
Why'd you do that to me?

01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:44.543
Shit! What!

01:04:44.543 --> 01:04:47.421
You sold me off to JANG! Bastard!

01:04:47.587 --> 01:04:48.797
So What if I did.

01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:50.715
Why'd you do it!

01:04:50.715 --> 01:04:53.093
Hustler, my ass.

01:04:53.093 --> 01:04:56.304
You cheated and crushed countless people!

01:04:56.304 --> 01:05:00.976
Where's the thanks for getting you the job!

01:05:00.976 --> 01:05:05.272
Cuz you can play, boss only looked after you!

01:05:05.272 --> 01:05:06.148
Son of a bitch.

01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:07.649
That's the reason?

01:05:08.567 --> 01:05:11.820
You ungrateful bastard!

01:05:17.325 --> 01:05:20.954
If you sold me off,
why aren't you living it up?

01:05:21.413 --> 01:05:22.998
Why'd you end up like this?

01:05:22.998 --> 01:05:25.333
I got done in by SEO, too!

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:26.251
What?

01:05:26.251 --> 01:05:30.422
It was SEO who set up the boss
to lose everything!

01:05:30.464 --> 01:05:31.465
What do you mean!

01:05:31.465 --> 01:05:36.511
It wasn't a set up for WOO but the boss!

01:05:37.512 --> 01:05:39.181
Lose $400 grand more.

01:05:39.181 --> 01:05:40.515
Let's set her up.

01:05:40.515 --> 01:05:42.684
If this job fails, we'll go under.

01:05:42.684 --> 01:05:43.602
Dae-gil?

01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:45.395
Chief SEO?

01:05:45.479 --> 01:05:46.480
Pass me the lighter.

01:05:47.898 --> 01:05:49.316
What about Ms. WOO?

01:05:49.316 --> 01:05:53.403
What else? She's the hustler!

01:05:56.281 --> 01:05:57.324
Do you love me?

01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:08.335
Dae-gil.

01:06:09.336 --> 01:06:10.629
I'm sorry.

01:06:13.507 --> 01:06:15.717
That girl, Mina...

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.928
She got sold cuz of you.

01:06:21.348 --> 01:06:24.267
This is my fight, sir.

01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:30.148
I'll come back, if I'm lucky.

01:06:52.837 --> 01:06:54.297
Asshole! That's mine!

01:06:56.883 --> 01:06:57.968
Who are you?

01:07:05.475 --> 01:07:06.643
Shit!

01:07:14.401 --> 01:07:16.570
Son of a bitch!

01:07:18.863 --> 01:07:20.615
Hey, Stop!

01:07:28.123 --> 01:07:28.873
Who's this?

01:07:29.249 --> 01:07:30.208
Chinese delivery?

01:07:31.459 --> 01:07:32.794
You the boss here?

01:07:33.044 --> 01:07:35.755
Where's the respect, kid?

01:07:35.755 --> 01:07:37.716
How old are ya. Let go.

01:07:42.262 --> 01:07:43.179
Where's Mina?

01:07:43.638 --> 01:07:46.474
HUH Mina?

01:07:47.434 --> 01:07:48.768
Gwang-sook?

01:07:49.185 --> 01:07:50.103
No idea where she is...

01:07:50.103 --> 01:07:51.730
Where is she!

01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:53.106
Shut up or else!

01:07:57.569 --> 01:07:58.862
Where's Mina?

01:08:04.659 --> 01:08:07.537
Sell her to me.

01:08:20.675 --> 01:08:23.261
My dear Gwang-sook!

01:08:23.553 --> 01:08:25.846
Your knight has come to rescue you.

01:08:25.889 --> 01:08:28.642
Hey, move!

01:08:28.642 --> 01:08:31.478
Take a break folks and watch the big game.

01:08:36.774 --> 01:08:40.069
Move! Now!

01:08:49.203 --> 01:08:51.497
Listen carefully to the rules.

01:08:51.497 --> 01:08:53.541
Just one game.

01:08:53.875 --> 01:08:57.754
Winner gets to cut the wrist.

01:08:58.087 --> 01:09:01.841
A gambler's hand raises the stakes, huh?

01:09:02.634 --> 01:09:06.554
If you win, leave the money and take the girl.

01:09:06.554 --> 01:09:10.642
But you get to cut the wrist. Too bad.

01:09:11.685 --> 01:09:12.977
But if you lose

01:09:12.977 --> 01:09:18.149
The girl stays along with her hand.
And I'll lessen her debt.

01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:20.652
Damn! It's hard to explain.

01:09:22.278 --> 01:09:23.988
If I win, burn that.

01:09:23.988 --> 01:09:25.365
Cut the wrist first.

01:09:26.448 --> 01:09:29.285
Stupid. I told you not to come here.

01:09:29.493 --> 01:09:31.371
My life is yours, remember?

01:09:31.537 --> 01:09:32.997
You'll lose no matter what.

01:09:34.416 --> 01:09:35.959
I'll just watch your eyes.

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:37.460
I promise...

01:09:37.544 --> 01:09:38.920
Let's get out together.

01:09:40.921 --> 01:09:45.093
Playing lovebirds here. That's cute.

01:09:45.301 --> 01:09:47.178
Here. I'll deal.

01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:42.525
The crowd's curious. Open your cards.

01:10:42.525 --> 01:10:43.777
Lady first.

01:10:51.159 --> 01:10:52.452
9 Pair!

01:10:52.535 --> 01:10:54.287
That's my girl!

01:10:54.454 --> 01:10:58.124
A girl with one hand ain't
gonna be pretty, right?

01:10:58.166 --> 01:10:59.793
You're screwed kid.

01:11:00.084 --> 01:11:01.127
Open it.

01:11:06.216 --> 01:11:09.719
The dickhead picked a stupid card!

01:11:17.644 --> 01:11:20.939
Nasty fool! You won to save your hand!

01:11:20.939 --> 01:11:22.190
Shut up!

01:11:22.524 --> 01:11:23.817
Give me the IOU.

01:11:25.193 --> 01:11:26.361
Cut the hand first.

01:11:31.366 --> 01:11:34.244
Back off you bastards!

01:11:57.976 --> 01:11:59.310
What the hell?

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:01.187
You said the winner gets to cut.

01:12:01.479 --> 01:12:03.356
It's up to me to choose whose hand!

01:12:03.356 --> 01:12:05.817
You fucking son of a bitch!

01:12:05.817 --> 01:12:06.901
Why?

01:12:07.777 --> 01:12:10.280
It's not enough to make me a cripple

01:12:30.842 --> 01:12:31.801
Give me a smoke

01:12:43.813 --> 01:12:46.608
Damn bastards! There's no smoking here...

01:13:03.249 --> 01:13:04.459
Game over.

01:13:10.298 --> 01:13:12.675
Hey! Take your lighter!

01:13:16.804 --> 01:13:18.348
Pretty cool, bastard.

01:13:18.681 --> 01:13:22.185
You can take her, but pay off her interest.

01:13:22.185 --> 01:13:23.436
Bastard! What interest!

01:13:23.519 --> 01:13:25.271
Calm down.

01:13:25.897 --> 01:13:29.609
You paid off JANG, but you still owe me.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:35.323
Interest and compensation
for breaking my heart.

01:13:35.823 --> 01:13:38.534
Just pay me $500,000.

01:13:38.743 --> 01:13:39.619
What if we can't?

01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:41.162
Then, work here.

01:13:41.245 --> 01:13:44.499
But what good would a cripple be?

01:13:45.166 --> 01:13:46.960
Mina will have to sell her body.

01:13:47.085 --> 01:13:48.211
Here's the money.

01:13:55.885 --> 01:13:58.221
Take that and let them go.

01:13:58.596 --> 01:14:00.932
If it isn't Mr. GO!

01:14:01.599 --> 01:14:04.102
I heard you play in small pools.

01:14:04.644 --> 01:14:06.521
If you show up, my uncle said

01:14:06.771 --> 01:14:10.650
you'd lose your remaining hand.

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:12.068
Didn't you hear?

01:14:13.695 --> 01:14:14.904
This isn't enough.

01:14:16.114 --> 01:14:19.075
With this it'll be over $500,000.

01:14:19.909 --> 01:14:20.868
Let them go!

01:14:23.871 --> 01:14:24.664
No way.

01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:31.087
The owner here doesn't keep his word.

01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:34.924
Who'd come if you can't leave
with your winnings?

01:14:44.559 --> 01:14:45.393
Secret code

01:14:45.476 --> 01:14:48.271
Nice and easy. 1234.

01:14:52.692 --> 01:14:53.818
Let's go.

01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:08.374
She slept straight for two days.

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:11.919
She's not suited for this world either.

01:15:12.587 --> 01:15:16.591
You're not one to get rich on gambling either.

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:19.552
What riches for a gambler?

01:15:20.511 --> 01:15:22.472
Then, Why'd you gamble all your life?

01:15:22.472 --> 01:15:26.350
It's because I couldn't walk away.

01:15:29.729 --> 01:15:31.397
Let me help.

01:15:35.651 --> 01:15:36.736
In the past...

01:15:38.071 --> 01:15:41.991
there were 3 legendary gamblers in the country.

01:15:42.617 --> 01:15:45.369
PYUNG, Jjak-gwi,

01:15:45.787 --> 01:15:47.413
and Agwi.

01:15:47.705 --> 01:15:50.666
PYUNG fell off a running train.

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:53.211
Jjak-gwi lost an ear to Agwi

01:15:53.211 --> 01:15:57.131
and ended up in a nursing home.

01:15:57.965 --> 01:15:59.509
And Agwi...

01:15:59.509 --> 01:16:01.511
He)', GO Gwang-ryeol!

01:16:07.934 --> 01:16:09.477
Never cross paths with Agwi.

01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:13.689
He's the devil of gambling.

01:16:14.732 --> 01:16:20.279
He ended up getting his hand
cut by PYUNG's disciple.

01:16:22.156 --> 01:16:24.283
Gamblers have one fate.

01:16:24.742 --> 01:16:27.578
If you don't quit, you'll face misfortune.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.251
What happened to the disciple?

01:16:36.546 --> 01:16:38.256
He became the Hands of God

01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:41.926
The ultimate for a hustler.

01:16:42.385 --> 01:16:46.597
When he had the ultimate, unbeatable cards...

01:16:47.932 --> 01:16:50.601
he got up and walked away
from gambling forever.

01:16:52.353 --> 01:16:55.398
If you think she's worth it,

01:16:55.398 --> 01:16:57.024
then try being the Hands of God.

01:17:11.998 --> 01:17:13.207
This place is good.

01:17:14.041 --> 01:17:15.293
Have some more.

01:17:17.044 --> 01:17:18.129
How's your hand?

01:17:18.462 --> 01:17:19.797
How's Gwang-chul?

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.509
He's in prison.

01:17:25.803 --> 01:17:27.305
He killed a man cuz of me.

01:17:28.723 --> 01:17:30.808
Wanna hear the dark story?

01:17:32.393 --> 01:17:36.147
Tell me whenever.
We'll be together from now on.

01:17:36.147 --> 01:17:37.523
Says who?

01:17:37.523 --> 01:17:38.816
HUH Mina of course.

01:17:39.442 --> 01:17:40.568
You said you loved me.

01:17:40.776 --> 01:17:41.944
When?

01:17:41.944 --> 01:17:43.404
When you pulled the knife out...

01:17:43.779 --> 01:17:45.406
your eyes said so.

01:17:46.365 --> 01:17:47.658
The eyes can't lie.

01:17:49.785 --> 01:17:51.746
Just hear the story.

01:17:52.997 --> 01:17:54.999
Know my brother's friend Wang

01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:58.628
He introduced him to Ghost.

01:18:00.463 --> 01:18:02.548
This is my friend, sir.

01:18:03.216 --> 01:18:04.467
I'm HUH Gwang-chul, sir!

01:18:05.593 --> 01:18:07.011
Where's HUH Gwang-chul?

01:18:07.428 --> 01:18:09.222
Come out now! Why work in a shithole!

01:18:09.222 --> 01:18:14.894
I went in to get my brother
and caught JANG's eye.

01:18:14.894 --> 01:18:17.313
Get out!

01:18:19.148 --> 01:18:25.196
He sent my brother on a job to Dr. HWANG.

01:18:25.655 --> 01:18:27.573
Have a drink before you go.

01:18:28.074 --> 01:18:30.284
The bastards set him up.

01:18:31.577 --> 01:18:32.787
Thank you, sir.

01:18:34.664 --> 01:18:35.873
Thank you.

01:18:38.251 --> 01:18:40.211
My naive brother...

01:18:41.837 --> 01:18:45.466
got drugged up and used.

01:18:47.593 --> 01:18:53.766
Made him owe Ghost, then came to me.

01:18:55.351 --> 01:18:57.395
Said I could pay off his debt.

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.692
JANG said...

01:19:03.234 --> 01:19:09.365
Just dress up and play cards with some men.

01:19:10.616 --> 01:19:12.576
And drink coffee.

01:19:17.373 --> 01:19:19.417
I got drugged UP---

01:19:21.168 --> 01:19:25.339
and dragged around dozens of times.

01:19:28.676 --> 01:19:31.053
My brother didn't mean to kill Wang...

01:19:32.763 --> 01:19:34.432
but he lost it.

01:19:39.353 --> 01:19:41.397
I'm a filthy bitch.

01:19:43.566 --> 01:19:44.817
Meet someone better.

01:19:46.736 --> 01:19:49.196
Who's better than the girl who saved my life?

01:19:51.365 --> 01:19:54.660
I'm not a great man yet.

01:19:55.745 --> 01:19:58.456
But if a gambler quits gambling, isn't that great?

01:19:59.957 --> 01:20:02.710
Live a new life from now on.

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.090
With me.

01:20:11.177 --> 01:20:12.636
Wanna kiss?

01:20:25.608 --> 01:20:27.234
Why'd you sell her?

01:20:27.568 --> 01:20:28.736
What?

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:32.365
I told you not to sell her to anyone else.

01:20:33.824 --> 01:20:34.909
She's mine.

01:20:37.787 --> 01:20:41.540
I'll find another useful gal for you.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:47.046
If you're dumb, you should at least listen.

01:20:48.714 --> 01:20:51.175
When your uncle is so great...

01:20:53.469 --> 01:20:57.264
Close your house down and work under me.

01:20:57.848 --> 01:20:58.808
Like a dog.

01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:05.815
You have pretty eyes.

01:21:07.066 --> 01:21:07.942
KIM

01:21:09.026 --> 01:21:10.194
Yes, boss.

01:21:10.653 --> 01:21:14.281
Call Dr. HWANG and ask if he needs two eyes.

01:21:14.573 --> 01:21:15.533
Yes, sir.

01:21:27.294 --> 01:21:30.589
Find her and text me before brunch tomorrow.

01:21:32.508 --> 01:21:33.634
Yes, sir.

01:21:35.302 --> 01:21:39.140
Go back to your hometown or move out.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:42.476
How can I made you
lose all your retirement money.

01:21:42.476 --> 01:21:44.937
I'll support you for life.

01:21:44.937 --> 01:21:47.273
How?You quit gambling.

01:21:47.273 --> 01:21:49.650
- Chinese restaurants suck here.
- So

01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:51.777
- Let's run one.
- What?

01:21:51.777 --> 01:21:55.531
Mina and I'll cook, you can deliver.

01:21:55.531 --> 01:21:58.367
What! Me, deliver

01:22:05.624 --> 01:22:08.127
My boss wants to see you.

01:22:08.252 --> 01:22:09.795
For what. The deal's done.

01:22:10.171 --> 01:22:11.964
I'm not sure.

01:22:11.964 --> 01:22:13.883
But my boss wants me to bring you two.

01:22:14.216 --> 01:22:15.050
Who's he?

01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:16.010
Take Mina and run.

01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:18.554
My boss says to bring you right now.

01:22:18.888 --> 01:22:20.014
Come here.

01:22:20.181 --> 01:22:21.515
Like chicken?

01:22:29.273 --> 01:22:30.149
Dae-gil!

01:22:31.066 --> 01:22:32.902
Hurry!

01:22:34.069 --> 01:22:35.779
Hurry UP!

01:22:35.779 --> 01:22:37.072
You can't come in here.

01:22:37.072 --> 01:22:39.700
Help us, please

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.911
Some bastard is...

01:22:42.077 --> 01:22:43.204
There! See

01:22:43.204 --> 01:22:44.455
Wait.

01:22:46.207 --> 01:22:48.292
You can't come in here.

01:22:49.627 --> 01:22:50.753
See that

01:24:08.747 --> 01:24:09.957
Dae-gil...

01:24:09.999 --> 01:24:13.210
I'm dying. How'd this happen...

01:24:13.294 --> 01:24:14.503
Sir...

01:24:15.963 --> 01:24:17.298
Dae-gil...

01:24:21.093 --> 01:24:23.137
No revenge.

01:24:25.097 --> 01:24:26.181
Okay?

01:24:27.016 --> 01:24:27.725
Got it?

01:24:27.725 --> 01:24:30.477
Bastards!

01:24:31.895 --> 01:24:37.109
Oh no! Please! No!

01:24:37.109 --> 01:24:38.819
Help me!

01:24:41.363 --> 01:24:42.156
Sir...

01:24:42.156 --> 01:24:45.909
Love hard. Passionately...

01:24:46.535 --> 01:24:48.120
What are you saying?

01:24:52.374 --> 01:24:53.917
Sir!

01:25:23.113 --> 01:25:25.157
It's been six months.

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:26.867
I've been busy.

01:25:27.117 --> 01:25:31.121
I heard Ghost lost everything and went in under JANG.

01:25:31.372 --> 01:25:32.706
Damn fly went to shit.

01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:34.500
Are you behind it?

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:35.793
Found your friend?

01:25:36.293 --> 01:25:37.878
Don't do anything dangerous.

01:25:37.878 --> 01:25:40.005
Leaving them be is more dangerous.

01:25:45.302 --> 01:25:46.804
I'll send you his number.

01:25:47.221 --> 01:25:50.099
His name's CHO Hwa-baek.

01:25:52.559 --> 01:25:54.269
Two months left, right?

01:25:55.521 --> 01:25:58.732
Sorry for being a big brother like this...

01:26:00.359 --> 01:26:02.403
When you get out, let's live normally.

01:26:03.153 --> 01:26:05.823
Get married and eat out on salaries.

01:26:05.823 --> 01:26:07.658
Save up and buy homes.

01:26:08.992 --> 01:26:12.871
And play cards just on Thanksgiving
and New Year's.

01:26:15.582 --> 01:26:17.668
Be careful you!

01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:23.507
Don't worry, I'm a hustler.

01:26:23.716 --> 01:26:25.175
Why you.

01:26:27.052 --> 01:26:28.470
How's Dae-gil?

01:26:34.435 --> 01:26:38.355
Says CHO Hwa-baek is a pro
at setting people up.

01:26:38.397 --> 01:26:42.943
And his friend Plier is good
at picking locks and stuff.

01:26:49.324 --> 01:26:53.078
Feel bad going against his will not
to get revenge

01:26:53.537 --> 01:26:55.831
I'm not getting revenge for him.

01:26:57.458 --> 01:26:58.751
Don't worry.

01:27:01.712 --> 01:27:03.464
It's for the chicken that got dropped.

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.723
I'm originally from a different field.

01:27:12.723 --> 01:27:15.684
I used to be a theatrical actor.

01:27:16.351 --> 01:27:18.520
Know Hamlet Shakespeare?

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.482
"Frailty, thy name is woman."

01:27:21.857 --> 01:27:24.693
Hey, Plier. Why isn't this working?

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.283
I owe Gwang-chul from prison together.

01:27:31.366 --> 01:27:33.452
He saved you from being raped.

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.665
Almost from being raped.

01:27:39.208 --> 01:27:41.210
What's our schedule like this month?

01:27:44.129 --> 01:27:46.590
The job is to get $5 million.

01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:49.259
After investor's interest and so on,

01:27:49.259 --> 01:27:51.094
we'll still give you $1 million each.

01:27:51.512 --> 01:27:53.263
If we get more, we'll divide it.

01:27:55.474 --> 01:27:58.227
I heard you work for the thrill, not the money.

01:27:58.310 --> 01:28:00.270
Why didn't you say so?

01:28:02.064 --> 01:28:05.692
Who, when, where, how do you want us to set up?

01:28:06.985 --> 01:28:08.946
I win!

01:28:09.238 --> 01:28:12.449
Like you said, the bitch is gambling crazy.

01:28:12.699 --> 01:28:15.911
She owes rent and workers' pay,
but has money to gamble.

01:28:16.453 --> 01:28:19.748
Get her with this rigged set.

01:28:20.582 --> 01:28:23.502
See! All five kings!

01:28:23.919 --> 01:28:25.546
Stop! I'm done!

01:28:26.213 --> 01:28:27.798
Now what?

01:28:27.798 --> 01:28:29.800
Take the spoon from the hungry.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.926
Plier

01:28:33.387 --> 01:28:36.056
Wait one week. I got robbed.

01:28:36.056 --> 01:28:39.935
I guess for you, Mrs. SONG. I'll wait.

01:28:40.102 --> 01:28:42.688
Thanks! I'll pay you lots of interest!

01:28:42.688 --> 01:28:45.065
Enter Mina.

01:28:45.065 --> 01:28:48.026
Mr. CHO! How've you been?

01:28:48.026 --> 01:28:50.779
Madam! What brings you here?

01:28:50.779 --> 01:28:53.240
What else? To spend money.

01:28:53.574 --> 01:28:54.700
How's business?

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:56.994
- Same old...
- Who's she?

01:28:56.994 --> 01:29:01.456
A rich old man's girl who sucks at gambling.

01:29:01.456 --> 01:29:02.332
3 pair.

01:29:02.416 --> 01:29:04.251
4 pair.

01:29:05.961 --> 01:29:07.129
Dang it!

01:29:10.591 --> 01:29:14.845
- She keeps winning. There must be cameras.
- Bye!

01:29:29.526 --> 01:29:31.987
Okay. 6 pair.

01:29:36.533 --> 01:29:39.161
-$'lo grand.
- I raise $20,000 more!

01:29:39.161 --> 01:29:40.370
I raise $30,000 more!

01:29:40.537 --> 01:29:42.539
I raise $50,000 more!

01:29:42.539 --> 01:29:44.541
I raise $100,000 more!

01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:50.005
I'll see that and raise $300,000 more.

01:29:53.717 --> 01:29:54.885
Take collateral?

01:29:57.721 --> 01:29:59.056
Not your body.

01:29:59.890 --> 01:30:00.891
Is it higher than 9 pair?

01:30:00.891 --> 01:30:04.394
Shit! I have 8 pair.

01:30:11.443 --> 01:30:12.235
What is it?

01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:14.613
See for yourself.

01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:16.740
What the hell!

01:30:25.791 --> 01:30:26.959
Here's a tip.

01:30:33.048 --> 01:30:35.717
To be or not to be! Money is the question!

01:30:35.717 --> 01:30:37.427
Ophelia, where art thou?

01:30:37.636 --> 01:30:39.930
Stop! You base fellow!

01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:42.641
Money!

01:30:42.641 --> 01:30:45.143
Let's go on to the next act!

01:30:47.938 --> 01:30:51.817
I'll end up in the streets thanks to you, sir.

01:30:51.817 --> 01:30:56.196
Sorry. I promise to lose big, next week.

01:30:56.196 --> 01:30:59.074
How can I win off a pro like you, sir

01:30:59.074 --> 01:31:00.409
Why you.

01:31:00.409 --> 01:31:03.286
- You were great today.
- Thanks.

01:31:04.329 --> 01:31:07.624
Pay the rest when you move in next month.

01:31:07.624 --> 01:31:10.252
You bought it at a good price.

01:31:11.211 --> 01:31:13.880
You can learn a few things from me.

01:31:14.089 --> 01:31:16.883
I'll teach you after my golf game.

01:31:18.051 --> 01:31:19.594
Don't be late.

01:31:24.224 --> 01:31:26.101
I'm from Interpol.

01:31:28.603 --> 01:31:29.813
Know this man?

01:31:29.813 --> 01:31:31.481
Yes, sir. Bye.

01:31:31.690 --> 01:31:33.358
Why did he cancel everything?

01:31:33.358 --> 01:31:34.401
I think he caught on.

01:31:34.401 --> 01:31:38.655
After all the bait money! What about our house?

01:31:40.782 --> 01:31:41.533
Hello

01:31:41.783 --> 01:31:43.702
Hi, Chief SEO.

01:31:43.702 --> 01:31:46.997
Yes, I saw your text.

01:31:47.789 --> 01:31:50.042
Then, I'll see you there.

01:31:50.333 --> 01:31:51.501
Bye.

01:31:52.294 --> 01:31:53.712
We got them!

01:31:54.504 --> 01:31:55.797
Plier!

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.225
What the hell!

01:32:07.225 --> 01:32:09.853
- Honey! A towel! Sorry.
- Damn.

01:32:09.853 --> 01:32:11.521
Pass the lighter.

01:32:12.147 --> 01:32:13.607
What did you spill?

01:32:13.607 --> 01:32:17.903
Oh no, your pants...Here's a towel.

01:32:20.113 --> 01:32:21.448
I'm sorry.

01:32:21.448 --> 01:32:23.075
Why drink coffee during a game?

01:32:23.075 --> 01:32:25.702
Why'd you put it here?

01:32:28.121 --> 01:32:30.290
Blue Stripes for grabs.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.668
Red Stripes for grabs.

01:32:33.668 --> 01:32:34.377
Three of a kind.

01:32:34.503 --> 01:32:36.171
Quadruple points.

01:32:39.549 --> 01:32:41.343
Got the 3 points for Blue Stripes!

01:32:41.384 --> 01:32:42.385
You could win big!

01:32:44.346 --> 01:32:45.138
One Go.

01:32:47.641 --> 01:32:48.600
I'm screwed.

01:32:51.895 --> 01:32:54.189
Godori up for grabs!

01:33:00.737 --> 01:33:02.614
Quadruple points if I win over you.

01:33:04.699 --> 01:33:05.450
One Go.

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.251
Red Stripes, huh?

01:33:15.127 --> 01:33:17.462
I'm out. It's up to you two.

01:33:18.088 --> 01:33:20.549
Damn!

01:33:20.799 --> 01:33:22.092
I'm sorry.

01:33:25.804 --> 01:33:27.055
This is terrible.

01:33:35.564 --> 01:33:36.898
A whammy!

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.034
One card each, please.

01:33:50.787 --> 01:33:51.580
Shit.

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:52.914
I have no choice.

01:33:55.917 --> 01:33:56.710
Two Go.

01:34:05.719 --> 01:34:06.845
This one's mine.

01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:09.556
Three Go.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.948
How many points?

01:34:26.948 --> 01:34:28.742
4 kings, 5 birds,

01:34:28.742 --> 01:34:31.995
3 animals, 1 stripe, 12 pawns...

01:34:31.995 --> 01:34:34.873
and Three Go totals 28 points.

01:34:34.873 --> 01:34:37.167
Quadruple for winning over you, 224 points.

01:34:37.167 --> 01:34:41.171
Triple for no kings and tens. 1792 points.

01:34:41.171 --> 01:34:43.715
Double for Three Go. 3584

01:34:43.715 --> 01:34:47.928
You have to pay for Mr. CHO. 3584
plus 1792 points...

01:34:47.928 --> 01:34:51.473
5376 points times $50G...

01:34:54.059 --> 01:34:57.979
You owe $2,688,000. Any questions

01:35:01.942 --> 01:35:06.613
Looks like around $200 grand.
What about the $2.5 mill?

01:35:07.113 --> 01:35:09.574
I heard you're rich. Please...

01:35:09.574 --> 01:35:12.577
But I'm playing with my uncle's money.

01:35:16.122 --> 01:35:17.374
Uncle

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:20.293
Could you come up?

01:35:21.753 --> 01:35:23.463
This is a lot too...

01:35:23.755 --> 01:35:24.631
Mr. CHO

01:35:24.881 --> 01:35:25.966
The door, please.

01:35:47.696 --> 01:35:49.739
Been a long time, SEO.

01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:51.658
SONG? Did you lose weight?

01:35:51.658 --> 01:35:52.909
Thank you.

01:35:53.285 --> 01:35:54.119
How much?

01:35:54.244 --> 01:35:55.245
Minus the small change?

01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:56.538
Of course not.

01:35:56.538 --> 01:35:58.707
It's exactly $2,688,000.

01:36:00.458 --> 01:36:02.210
Those not involved may go.

01:36:06.047 --> 01:36:07.215
Thank you.

01:36:16.391 --> 01:36:19.019
An eye for an eye.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.439
That's what you said, right?

01:36:27.569 --> 01:36:30.530
Dr. HWANG. They're all yours.

01:36:30.613 --> 01:36:34.200
The woman would be worth more
after having the baby.

01:36:35.118 --> 01:36:36.119
Sir!

01:36:36.453 --> 01:36:37.996
Do I know you?

01:36:37.996 --> 01:36:40.498
Sir! Please!

01:36:40.498 --> 01:36:43.752
Please! No!

01:36:49.924 --> 01:36:53.136
Good job. Not bad in acting.

01:36:54.512 --> 01:36:56.056
Really?

01:36:58.266 --> 01:37:02.187
Be good or else you'll meet me again.

01:37:11.029 --> 01:37:15.492
Please, I don't need this.

01:37:16.159 --> 01:37:19.204
That's no respect for your pretty hand.

01:37:24.876 --> 01:37:25.877
Hold on.

01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:30.507
Hello

01:37:46.731 --> 01:37:48.566
Sounds easy.

01:37:49.734 --> 01:37:50.693
But why me?

01:37:50.735 --> 01:37:52.404
It can't fail.

01:37:53.905 --> 01:37:55.657
No man can resist you.

01:37:58.076 --> 01:38:00.995
But I'm working on something these days.

01:38:00.995 --> 01:38:04.082
The diamond's too small.

01:38:05.208 --> 01:38:06.876
That's no respect for your hand.

01:38:10.422 --> 01:38:11.923
What percentage will I get?

01:38:13.216 --> 01:38:14.217
The norm.

01:38:15.343 --> 01:38:17.262
You've changed so much.

01:38:17.554 --> 01:38:19.222
So, you're in?

01:38:25.687 --> 01:38:27.355
How about truth or dare?

01:38:28.314 --> 01:38:29.691
Did you love me?

01:38:31.526 --> 01:38:32.527
With all my heart.

01:38:32.527 --> 01:38:34.154
Do you still love me?

01:38:52.755 --> 01:38:54.174
I don't get it.

01:38:54.466 --> 01:38:55.508
What?

01:38:55.508 --> 01:38:58.136
Take the gold mine yourself.

01:38:58.136 --> 01:39:01.139
Why would you share it with me?

01:39:02.849 --> 01:39:07.020
It's a large sum and I'm kinda scared.

01:39:07.395 --> 01:39:12.275
I want someone to help,
but I've nowhere to turn to.

01:39:12.901 --> 01:39:16.029
I need a talented pro like you.

01:39:18.406 --> 01:39:20.450
- Ghost
- Yes

01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:21.910
Eat outside.

01:39:22.911 --> 01:39:24.204
Yes, sir.

01:39:33.087 --> 01:39:35.423
How about going out for a drink?

01:39:35.673 --> 01:39:37.217
Enough business talk.

01:39:37.675 --> 01:39:38.968
Who's behind you?

01:39:39.302 --> 01:39:40.512
What?

01:39:43.723 --> 01:39:45.099
Behind me

01:39:45.934 --> 01:39:47.477
Must be HAM Dae-gil.

01:39:48.353 --> 01:39:53.566
I heard he cleaned out SONG and SEO.

01:39:53.566 --> 01:39:56.611
Probably did that to get money ready.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.489
Let me guess what he asked you.

01:39:59.614 --> 01:40:04.869
Approach JANG Dong-shik
and find out where his money is.

01:40:05.078 --> 01:40:06.663
Or have him sit in a game.

01:40:06.871 --> 01:40:10.959
Or lure me to hand all my money to you.

01:40:10.959 --> 01:40:13.169
You should become a writer.

01:40:16.673 --> 01:40:19.551
I don't trust women in short skirts.

01:40:27.308 --> 01:40:29.269
See yourself out.

01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:35.942
You must be a eunuch!

01:41:30.413 --> 01:41:31.748
Just take half.

01:41:32.457 --> 01:41:33.416
Millions in gambling money...

01:41:33.416 --> 01:41:34.250
"MONEY FOUND IN WAREHOUSE"

01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:35.501
"5 MILLION SEIZED"

01:41:35.501 --> 01:41:36.628
JANG Dong-shik's millions found.

01:41:36.628 --> 01:41:37.629
"LEDGER OF BRIBES FOUND"

01:41:37.629 --> 01:41:38.546
"APOLOGY FROM BRIBED POLICE"

01:41:38.546 --> 01:41:39.672
We are deeply sorry.

01:41:39.672 --> 01:41:40.632
Officers' names in the ledger...

01:41:40.632 --> 01:41:41.799
There is a reward on JANG.

01:41:41.799 --> 01:41:43.176
"WANTED: JANG DONG-SHIK"

01:41:58.775 --> 01:42:00.276
She's pretty.

01:42:01.235 --> 01:42:02.236
How old?

01:42:03.488 --> 01:42:04.781
Count it, ma'am.

01:42:04.906 --> 01:42:06.824
Call me babe like you used to

01:42:09.077 --> 01:42:10.328
I'm leaving the country.

01:42:10.411 --> 01:42:11.329
Dae-gil

01:42:13.081 --> 01:42:14.290
Let's go together.

01:42:41.526 --> 01:42:45.196
I got the money.
Get me a passport and a ship out.

01:42:45.613 --> 01:42:48.783
If you can't get Dae-gil, get at least WOO!

01:42:48.783 --> 01:42:50.243
I'm wanted so...

01:42:51.119 --> 01:42:53.329
I'll call back later.

01:43:01.754 --> 01:43:03.631
Why aren't they picking up?

01:43:03.631 --> 01:43:04.507
" Hay que casarse"

01:43:04.507 --> 01:43:05.591
"INCHEON AIRPORT"

01:43:06.259 --> 01:43:07.635
What's that?

01:43:09.387 --> 01:43:11.431
I'll tell you in Barcelona.

01:43:12.557 --> 01:43:14.642
"WILL YOU MARRY ME?"

01:43:16.352 --> 01:43:17.770
Why didn't you pick up?

01:43:17.854 --> 01:43:20.398
Oh, I wonder why.

01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:24.235
Bring the money or they're dead.

01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:48.092
So loyal.

01:43:48.092 --> 01:43:50.219
Shut up. Where are they?

01:43:51.596 --> 01:43:52.889
Come here!

01:43:55.349 --> 01:43:56.100
Money!

01:44:00.396 --> 01:44:01.063
Go check.

01:44:15.745 --> 01:44:16.913
People first.

01:44:40.144 --> 01:44:41.395
Money first.

01:44:43.981 --> 01:44:45.399
Let's meet half way.

01:44:56.494 --> 01:44:57.537
Are you all right?

01:45:12.218 --> 01:45:12.844
Hey!

01:45:14.178 --> 01:45:14.804
Shit!

01:45:21.727 --> 01:45:22.854
No!

01:45:23.437 --> 01:45:26.399
Bring water! Now!

01:46:32.089 --> 01:46:33.215
Hope this works.

01:46:33.215 --> 01:46:35.384
Now what? No!

01:46:53.569 --> 01:46:57.573
Shit! I almost died!

01:46:57.573 --> 01:47:00.201
What? He could talk?

01:47:00.201 --> 01:47:02.828
He's from Mongolia. Says he almost died.

01:47:02.828 --> 01:47:04.288
- You okay
- You all right?

01:47:04.288 --> 01:47:05.706
What if I'm not?

01:47:05.706 --> 01:47:07.750
When did you get your license?

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.543
I didn't.

01:47:51.961 --> 01:47:53.254
Mina...

01:48:24.243 --> 01:48:25.745
Thanks.

01:48:25.995 --> 01:48:28.456
For destroying those bastards.

01:48:41.761 --> 01:48:44.013
Here's your passport.

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:47.767
Good work.

01:48:48.851 --> 01:48:50.227
Which ship do I go on

01:48:51.187 --> 01:48:52.897
Got him!

01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:55.816
Shit!

01:48:56.150 --> 01:48:58.652
That's enough.

01:49:00.529 --> 01:49:02.281
You'll kill him.

01:49:05.159 --> 01:49:06.285
Get rid of him.

01:49:12.333 --> 01:49:13.876
Hold on.

01:49:15.628 --> 01:49:17.963
This won't be enough.

01:49:18.464 --> 01:49:19.924
I don't understand.

01:49:33.646 --> 01:49:38.192
What did you just say?

01:49:38.901 --> 01:49:41.862
Sure your uncle will do it?

01:49:41.904 --> 01:49:43.531
Let's go to him now.

01:49:43.572 --> 01:49:47.827
We should drink to celebrate.

01:49:47.827 --> 01:49:48.953
I guess next time.

01:49:48.953 --> 01:49:51.288
We can drink in Hawaii.

01:49:51.413 --> 01:49:53.499
I'm sick of this country.

01:49:54.375 --> 01:49:57.378
Then, a toast with this

01:49:58.087 --> 01:49:59.255
Cheers.

01:50:28.909 --> 01:50:30.536
She had a miscarriage.

01:51:50.324 --> 01:51:51.575
Open it.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:00.709
Sir

01:52:00.876 --> 01:52:01.752
I'll be going.

01:52:02.378 --> 01:52:05.047
Throw the trash out, you rubbish!

01:52:05.464 --> 01:52:07.967
- Who's that
- My disciple.

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:10.219
He's good at sneaking bottom cards out.

01:52:10.594 --> 01:52:11.971
Remember him.

01:52:12.221 --> 01:52:15.140
He'll rule the gambling world some day.

01:52:17.101 --> 01:52:18.894
This looks like poison.

01:52:19.770 --> 01:52:21.981
I won it in gambling. It's clean.

01:52:21.981 --> 01:52:25.150
Let's see if touching it will kill me or not.

01:52:38.914 --> 01:52:40.916
I expect some company.

01:52:41.375 --> 01:52:43.711
Sir Some guests have come.

01:52:57.641 --> 01:52:58.851
Ghost?

01:52:59.685 --> 01:53:00.686
What are you doing here?

01:53:00.686 --> 01:53:04.106
Gwang-chul! What the hell are you doing here?

01:53:04.106 --> 01:53:06.650
Shut up and tell me where JANG is.

01:53:09.153 --> 01:53:12.823
How can they talk to me like that?

01:53:12.823 --> 01:53:15.534
The young man just said what I wanted to say.

01:53:15.951 --> 01:53:17.870
Just shut up for now.

01:53:18.162 --> 01:53:20.331
You came a long way. Come in.

01:53:20.873 --> 01:53:22.291
Looks like we need to talk.

01:53:22.499 --> 01:53:24.209
Make yourselves at home.

01:53:38.515 --> 01:53:40.059
What brings you here

01:53:40.142 --> 01:53:43.145
I came to kill JANG Dong-shik.

01:53:43.395 --> 01:53:44.897
JANG Dong-shik

01:53:45.481 --> 01:53:47.274
From the outskirts

01:53:48.692 --> 01:53:51.653
One out of 10 gamblers want revenge on him.

01:53:51.653 --> 01:53:54.615
But why look for him here?

01:53:59.703 --> 01:54:03.040
You said you won it.

01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:06.668
You worthless shit!

01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:09.213
Where's JANG?

01:54:09.213 --> 01:54:10.464
Probably dead.

01:54:11.924 --> 01:54:14.593
He's not one to die to you.

01:54:15.344 --> 01:54:19.098
I think he'll come through that door today.

01:54:19.848 --> 01:54:21.475
What timing!

01:54:24.019 --> 01:54:25.813
You son of a bitch!

01:54:41.453 --> 01:54:44.873
I'm JANG Dong-shik, sir.

01:54:44.873 --> 01:54:46.208
Please excuse my manners.

01:54:50.254 --> 01:54:51.296
Mr. Agwi, sir.

01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:54.174
Welcome, Mr. JANG.

01:54:54.716 --> 01:54:57.886
We met over 10 years ago in Yeosu, right?

01:54:57.970 --> 01:55:00.514
You remember me? It's an honor, sir.

01:55:00.639 --> 01:55:02.015
What brings you here?

01:55:02.015 --> 01:55:04.601
Your nephew took my bag by mistake.

01:55:04.601 --> 01:55:06.311
Like hell I did!

01:55:06.311 --> 01:55:08.647
I won it off you! You damn pig!

01:55:13.068 --> 01:55:15.988
If you give me my bag, I'll go quietly.

01:55:15.988 --> 01:55:17.614
Who Says!

01:55:17.614 --> 01:55:19.241
Your nephew's neck is on the line.

01:55:19.241 --> 01:55:22.953
You bastard! Think you can threaten me!

01:55:23.287 --> 01:55:24.955
Take off your shoes, asshole!

01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:39.386
Call back in 5 minutes.
If I don't answer, come up.

01:55:42.598 --> 01:55:43.348
Look.

01:55:44.057 --> 01:55:46.310
You want JANG's head, right

01:55:47.352 --> 01:55:48.145
And you?

01:55:48.812 --> 01:55:53.066
My money and that fool's organs.

01:55:53.192 --> 01:55:54.610
So scary.

01:55:55.527 --> 01:55:58.447
And you need that in U.S. dollars
to leave the country

01:55:58.447 --> 01:55:59.656
I'll give you some, Uncle.

01:55:59.865 --> 01:56:03.076
Forget it. Don't need it.

01:56:03.869 --> 01:56:04.745
Let's do this.

01:56:05.996 --> 01:56:08.290
Resolve gambling problems by gambling.

01:56:08.665 --> 01:56:09.791
In one game.

01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:13.712
Winner takes all that money.

01:56:13.879 --> 01:56:15.797
But it's mine to begin with.

01:56:15.797 --> 01:56:17.841
You lost it! It's mine!

01:56:17.841 --> 01:56:19.343
Forget the money.

01:56:19.343 --> 01:56:20.844
I just want JANG's head.

01:56:20.844 --> 01:56:24.848
Who says we bet just money.
We bet our heads, too.

01:56:26.016 --> 01:56:28.185
Play till you run out.

01:56:28.185 --> 01:56:32.940
The winner can kill the loser
if he wants or not.

01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:34.441
Why should we play?

01:56:37.736 --> 01:56:39.947
Don't you want one last game?

01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:44.993
Looks like you all want to end your damn ties.

01:56:45.786 --> 01:56:47.788
How can we trust you?

01:56:47.788 --> 01:56:49.540
I'll play for my nephew.

01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:53.293
If I lose, you can kill us both.

01:56:53.544 --> 01:56:56.922
JANG will need more incentive, right?

01:56:56.922 --> 01:56:59.091
How about $1 million each to play?

01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:03.136
Too little for your lives $2 million then?

01:57:04.721 --> 01:57:07.349
If you don't have enough, bring a player.

01:57:07.599 --> 01:57:10.936
Winner gets all, loser goes to hell.

01:57:11.186 --> 01:57:13.605
Doesn't it sound fun?

01:57:33.625 --> 01:57:35.460
Pick the time and place.

01:57:38.922 --> 01:57:40.841
Did you all eat?

01:57:47.306 --> 01:57:50.517
Never thought you'd borrow money from me.

01:57:51.518 --> 01:57:55.439
Pay me back. Don't make me get it out of you.

01:57:56.398 --> 01:57:58.859
Whatever. Thanks.

01:57:58.859 --> 01:58:00.277
Come back alive.

01:58:00.277 --> 01:58:02.237
If you don't, she'll die tragically.

01:58:02.237 --> 01:58:03.363
Wait! Hold on!

01:58:03.614 --> 01:58:06.033
I'll get Dae-gil! I can beat him!

01:58:06.241 --> 01:58:10.329
Think he'll come alone? You need my help!

01:58:10.329 --> 01:58:13.081
If I lose, kill me then!

01:58:15.208 --> 01:58:17.961
Sorry, I wasn't there when you got out.

01:58:20.464 --> 01:58:22.758
Don't ever go back in there.

01:58:23.967 --> 01:58:25.844
Don't worry, I won't.

01:58:26.553 --> 01:58:27.471
Bro

01:58:28.847 --> 01:58:30.474
Stay out of this one.

01:58:32.684 --> 01:58:34.895
Let me be a big brother for once.

01:58:40.233 --> 01:58:42.402
What did you and Dae-gil talk about?

01:58:44.905 --> 01:58:47.991
Just guys' talk.

01:59:00.671 --> 01:59:04.841
You can lose it all. Just come back alive.

01:59:05.133 --> 01:59:06.218
Thank you, sir.

01:59:07.302 --> 01:59:10.263
Want me to read your palm?

01:59:15.227 --> 01:59:16.937
You'll live a long life.

01:59:17.521 --> 01:59:18.980
If you quit gambling.

02:00:57.162 --> 02:00:59.748
A fine day to gamble, isn't it?

02:01:03.001 --> 02:01:05.796
Did the ladies hear what'll happen if you lose?

02:01:06.004 --> 02:01:06.963
What?

02:01:07.172 --> 02:01:08.757
I wonder what?

02:01:08.757 --> 02:01:11.551
He likes to cut and he likes to crush.

02:01:11.885 --> 02:01:13.220
You choose.

02:01:13.303 --> 02:01:15.847
Just don't freak out when you lose.

02:01:15.847 --> 02:01:17.682
Can't you tell I'm crazy?

02:01:19.017 --> 02:01:20.685
She's a feisty one.

02:01:20.769 --> 02:01:23.021
She's Crazy. Who are you?

02:01:23.104 --> 02:01:25.941
Must we exchange names?

02:01:26.650 --> 02:01:28.902
Used to be called Ace.

02:01:28.902 --> 02:01:31.488
Now, I'm just a bitch. Happy?

02:01:32.572 --> 02:01:34.825
You brought Crazy and Bitch as helpers

02:01:34.908 --> 02:01:37.994
Any last words before we start

02:01:40.872 --> 02:01:42.541
- Let's play naked.
- What?

02:01:43.416 --> 02:01:46.086
How can I beat hustlers who use tricks?

02:01:46.169 --> 02:01:49.506
Strip so you can't hide cards
under your clothes.

02:01:50.799 --> 02:01:53.969
I'd love it, but are you up for it?

02:01:54.135 --> 02:01:55.595
Just don't get too excited.

02:01:59.182 --> 02:02:00.392
Can't get your dick up, right?

02:02:07.190 --> 02:02:08.692
I have a condition, too.

02:02:10.735 --> 02:02:13.488
Let's play with these.
New cards every 10 games.

02:02:13.864 --> 02:02:16.449
You'll mark them with your nails.

02:02:16.449 --> 02:02:19.035
- Trust you old lady
- How old are you?

02:02:19.035 --> 02:02:21.872
Obviously younger than you.

02:02:25.041 --> 02:02:27.335
Here's the store receipt.

02:02:27.335 --> 02:02:29.754
Open any pack and check.

02:02:30.130 --> 02:02:35.093
Or send someone to buy them
if you don't trust me.

02:02:36.386 --> 02:02:38.179
It's hot in here.

02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:41.725
Just play with these.

02:02:42.225 --> 02:02:44.144
Where would we buy some now?

02:02:44.394 --> 02:02:47.063
Anything else?

02:02:47.063 --> 02:02:48.106
Let's play with one hand.

02:02:48.481 --> 02:02:51.067
Make sure there's no cheating.

02:02:51.359 --> 02:02:53.111
Let's just play with our left hands.

02:02:53.111 --> 02:02:56.907
Play with one hand or both.

02:02:57.157 --> 02:02:59.034
I don't care.

02:02:59.159 --> 02:03:00.619
Anything you'd like to add?

02:03:02.287 --> 02:03:03.580
Just beer, please.

02:03:03.747 --> 02:03:04.956
Get it for him.

02:03:05.332 --> 02:03:11.630
Now, let's play a clean, honest game, shall we?

02:03:11.630 --> 02:03:13.632
But what if you're caught cheating

02:03:14.925 --> 02:03:17.969
Let's cut off the elbow not the wrist.

02:03:18.178 --> 02:03:19.679
Elbow for people...

02:03:19.930 --> 02:03:21.681
and the neck for the pig.

02:03:21.765 --> 02:03:22.849
Think that'll do?

02:03:25.435 --> 02:03:27.270
Smith & Wesson 38.

02:03:28.021 --> 02:03:30.315
This made my hand like this.

02:03:32.317 --> 02:03:33.443
No spectators.

02:03:33.568 --> 02:03:34.819
Everyone out.

02:03:35.111 --> 02:03:36.279
Yes, sir.

02:03:47.332 --> 02:03:48.959
What's going on?

02:03:51.628 --> 02:03:52.837
Take them off.

02:04:04.224 --> 02:04:05.225
Bitch.

02:04:05.225 --> 02:04:07.102
Of all things in a game...

02:04:08.645 --> 02:04:09.980
Take this off, too?

02:04:13.858 --> 02:04:14.693
Let's roll.

02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:24.828
<i>7</i> points.

02:04:25.412 --> 02:04:26.121
8 points.

02:04:26.287 --> 02:04:27.080
8 points.

02:04:27.747 --> 02:04:29.916
8 pair.

02:04:29.916 --> 02:04:31.751
Shit!

02:04:40.343 --> 02:04:40.969
US$5,000

02:04:40.969 --> 02:04:41.970
Raise you $5,000.

02:04:41.970 --> 02:04:42.804
Raise you $10,000.

02:04:42.846 --> 02:04:44.848
-$20,000
-$30,000 more.

02:04:44.848 --> 02:04:45.765
$100,000 total.

02:04:56.026 --> 02:04:57.193
Check.

02:04:58.862 --> 02:04:59.863
9 points.

02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:01.823
3 pair.

02:05:07.871 --> 02:05:09.205
I fold.

02:05:10.206 --> 02:05:11.499
Just us two left.

02:05:13.209 --> 02:05:14.544
I bet $10,000.

02:05:15.837 --> 02:05:16.880
Raise you $10,000 more.

02:05:17.630 --> 02:05:18.423
$50,000 more.

02:05:19.215 --> 02:05:19.883
US$100,000

02:05:20.425 --> 02:05:21.468
US$400,000

02:05:25.263 --> 02:05:27.682
How much will it take to see your cards?

02:05:27.766 --> 02:05:29.809
Put in $400,000 more.

02:05:33.063 --> 02:05:33.980
Take it.

02:05:36.232 --> 02:05:37.025
6 points.

02:05:37.025 --> 02:05:38.234
<i>7</i> points.

02:05:38.735 --> 02:05:39.944
-2 pair.
-3 pair.

02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:41.821
-1 pair.
-10 pair.

02:05:43.156 --> 02:05:46.326
That pig eats well. Must be seeing the cards.

02:05:48.953 --> 02:05:50.246
Change cards.

02:05:50.663 --> 02:05:52.082
Open a new pack.

02:05:54.417 --> 02:05:58.046
Stop smoking, my head kills.

02:06:14.938 --> 02:06:16.898
What's a hustler?

02:06:17.357 --> 02:06:23.154
He has eyes on hands, ears on eyes,
and a nose on ears!

02:06:23.154 --> 02:06:25.740
I don't see anything. What markings?

02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:29.911
A hustler's eyes are special.

02:06:30.078 --> 02:06:33.540
Focus and you will see.

02:06:45.385 --> 02:06:46.719
I'm out.

02:06:53.434 --> 02:06:54.435
US$10,000

02:06:55.603 --> 02:06:56.521
Agwi...

02:06:56.646 --> 02:06:58.523
-1 and 4 for 5 points.
-$20,000 more.

02:06:59.065 --> 02:07:00.108
I'll see that.

02:07:00.108 --> 02:07:02.110
JANG has a 3 pair.

02:07:02.694 --> 02:07:03.403
And $100,000.

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.573
-$100,000 more.
- JANG wins.

02:07:07.198 --> 02:07:07.949
$200,000 more.

02:07:08.366 --> 02:07:09.200
$200,000 more.

02:07:09.325 --> 02:07:11.119
$300,000 on top.

02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:13.454
Pay it to see my cards.

02:07:20.170 --> 02:07:21.254
Check.

02:07:21.421 --> 02:07:22.088
3 pair.

02:07:26.801 --> 02:07:27.802
4 pair.

02:07:33.558 --> 02:07:34.601
Why?

02:07:34.934 --> 02:07:36.227
Think I cheated?

02:07:36.728 --> 02:07:37.687
No, sir.

02:07:37.687 --> 02:07:39.564
Yeah, right.

02:07:39.731 --> 02:07:42.442
There's a price for cheating.

02:07:57.957 --> 02:07:59.250
Watch carefully.

02:07:59.417 --> 02:08:01.920
I'll show you a magic trick.

02:08:03.463 --> 02:08:06.966
Crazy girl folded with 9 points, right?

02:08:08.134 --> 02:08:10.970
You had 7 points.

02:08:11.888 --> 02:08:14.140
It's like these cards are transparent.

02:08:14.641 --> 02:08:16.726
And the self-called Bitch

02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:18.645
5, 6 loser cards.

02:08:20.897 --> 02:08:23.650
You brought some amusing cards.

02:08:24.442 --> 02:08:25.693
Go out and wait.

02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:27.737
It won't take long.

02:08:29.864 --> 02:08:31.074
I didn't do it!

02:08:31.241 --> 02:08:32.867
JANG gave them to me!

02:08:32.867 --> 02:08:35.203
Bastard! You gave them to me!

02:08:35.245 --> 02:08:37.747
Dae-gil! This! This!

02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:39.207
You bastard!

02:08:39.290 --> 02:08:42.335
You bastards! I'll kill you all!

02:08:42.961 --> 02:08:45.421
Son of a bitch!

02:08:51.928 --> 02:08:53.721
Let's see your glasses.

02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:56.641
If you wanna see, place a bet.

02:08:56.975 --> 02:08:58.851
What'll it take to see?

02:09:00.061 --> 02:09:05.233
An eye from you and Dae-gil each, sir.

02:09:05.608 --> 02:09:07.860
Bastard! Dare make threats!

02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:17.203
If I lose everything...

02:09:17.704 --> 02:09:21.457
then cut my throat and see. Not before then.

02:09:22.292 --> 02:09:24.544
Looks like you know how to play.

02:09:25.086 --> 02:09:27.630
Fine. We'll gamble it out.

02:09:28.339 --> 02:09:29.882
If you're a true gambler...

02:09:30.216 --> 02:09:32.302
cut his throat with your cards.

02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:37.932
Turn up the boiler.

02:09:39.225 --> 02:09:40.560
I'll chip in for gas.

02:09:44.188 --> 02:09:45.940
Get rid of these cards.

02:09:46.941 --> 02:09:49.569
Go bring the cards you boys play with.

02:09:49.819 --> 02:09:50.903
And turn the boiler up.

02:09:57.702 --> 02:09:58.703
6 points.

02:09:58.703 --> 02:09:59.954
8 points.

02:10:00.204 --> 02:10:01.247
5 pair.

02:10:01.247 --> 02:10:02.540
9 pair.

02:10:04.334 --> 02:10:05.668
- I fold.
- I fold.

02:10:11.549 --> 02:10:12.717
US$5,000

02:10:13.134 --> 02:10:14.093
I fold.

02:10:14.218 --> 02:10:15.261
US$100

02:10:15.678 --> 02:10:16.387
Take it.

02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:24.395
1,000

02:10:26.731 --> 02:10:28.232
You followed GO

02:10:28.399 --> 02:10:29.525
SQ?

02:10:30.693 --> 02:10:35.615
Did he say he shit his pants
when I cut off his hand?

02:10:36.908 --> 02:10:38.034
Huh!

02:10:39.285 --> 02:10:40.620
Say that again?

02:10:40.745 --> 02:10:43.539
Looks like a tiger followed around a mouse.

02:10:43.998 --> 02:10:46.376
Wanna learn from a real pro?

02:10:48.127 --> 02:10:50.129
Shut up and place your bet.

02:10:51.964 --> 02:10:54.717
Sorry, not interested.

02:10:55.593 --> 02:10:56.969
I fold.

02:11:55.361 --> 02:11:56.237
Light, please.

02:12:01.367 --> 02:12:02.785
Aren't you betting?

02:12:04.912 --> 02:12:07.582
Just saw the mouse's ass following him

02:12:07.707 --> 02:12:08.332
What?

02:12:08.332 --> 02:12:09.917
Filming porn here?

02:12:10.209 --> 02:12:12.503
Why put your hand in her underwear?

02:12:13.171 --> 02:12:14.422
No, he didn't.

02:12:14.422 --> 02:12:16.007
Stop!

02:12:16.007 --> 02:12:16.841
You'll lose your hand!

02:12:16.841 --> 02:12:18.718
Shut up eunuch!

02:12:18.718 --> 02:12:20.636
I heard you sneak the bottom card.

02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:22.430
Open your hands.

02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:23.681
Why should I listen to you?

02:12:23.681 --> 02:12:25.933
We can cut off his hand and see.

02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:28.686
See?

02:12:29.437 --> 02:12:30.271
There.

02:12:30.855 --> 02:12:31.689
Happy?

02:12:31.731 --> 02:12:33.316
Like hell!

02:12:35.610 --> 02:12:37.862
Don't move or you'll lose your hands.

02:12:39.655 --> 02:12:41.991
You probably gave me a 9 pair.

02:12:43.034 --> 02:12:44.577
JANG?

02:12:45.244 --> 02:12:46.329
An 8 pair.

02:12:46.329 --> 02:12:48.498
You were going to win with a 10 pair?

02:12:48.956 --> 02:12:50.875
Think you can play me for a fool?

02:12:50.875 --> 02:12:53.127
You must be drunk.

02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:55.796
Place your bets.

02:12:55.796 --> 02:12:57.673
$1,000 to start.

02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:58.966
I'll raise that.

02:12:59.258 --> 02:13:02.720
I bet my head and money
that you have a 10 pair.

02:13:03.596 --> 02:13:07.558
I bet my head and money
there's a card in her panty.

02:13:09.519 --> 02:13:12.730
Show your ass and take it all if you can.

02:13:13.147 --> 02:13:14.649
What will you bet?

02:13:14.649 --> 02:13:15.983
What if I won't?

02:13:17.902 --> 02:13:20.571
Then die, fool!

02:13:22.698 --> 02:13:25.117
You'll regret this!

02:13:52.895 --> 02:13:53.604
Open it.

02:13:54.981 --> 02:13:55.773
Wait!

02:13:57.441 --> 02:13:59.569
My mentor told me something.

02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:00.486
What?

02:14:00.736 --> 02:14:03.864
That you lost your hand to PYUNG's disciple.

02:14:17.086 --> 02:14:19.422
How do you know Goni?

02:14:21.632 --> 02:14:23.342
You know my uncle?

02:14:28.723 --> 02:14:29.640
Open it.

02:14:39.525 --> 02:14:40.568
It's 1 point.

02:14:43.613 --> 02:14:46.240
Sometimes 1 point can beat a 10 pair.

02:14:46.574 --> 02:14:48.618
The old man is dead.

02:14:49.785 --> 02:14:52.163
Know what'll happen if you make her strip?

02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:57.710
Strip.

02:15:08.304 --> 02:15:10.139
A $10 million strip show, huh

02:15:12.767 --> 02:15:14.518
My backside is a killer.

02:15:33.454 --> 02:15:35.122
The pig is dead, too.

02:15:37.917 --> 02:15:38.876
Game over.

02:15:39.293 --> 02:15:41.128
Pack up the money.

02:16:01.482 --> 02:16:02.441
Ghost.

02:16:02.858 --> 02:16:03.859
Yes

02:16:04.026 --> 02:16:04.985
The hell

02:16:05.194 --> 02:16:07.738
I'll give you all my money, if you shoot!

02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:10.616
Crazy pig! Don't give me orders!

02:16:10.825 --> 02:16:13.869
I'll do it! You bastard!

02:16:15.413 --> 02:16:16.372
What now, Uncle?

02:16:16.372 --> 02:16:17.623
Don't. They won.

02:16:18.165 --> 02:16:19.750
Take all the money.

02:16:20.042 --> 02:16:22.753
But your uncle owes me.

02:16:23.087 --> 02:16:25.506
His nephew will have to pay.

02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:26.507
Blow his hand.

02:16:27.216 --> 02:16:29.260
Agwi has lost his taste.

02:16:29.343 --> 02:16:30.094
<i>Shoot!</i>

02:16:42.481 --> 02:16:44.608
Son of a bitch!

02:17:06.379 --> 02:17:07.715
Gwang-chul...

02:17:38.829 --> 02:17:40.331
Asshole.

02:17:42.583 --> 02:17:44.543
You're not worth it.

02:17:49.423 --> 02:17:53.385
You can't kill me, bastards!

02:18:37.054 --> 02:18:38.763
Shit!

02:18:39.306 --> 02:18:41.683
You bastards!

02:19:01.787 --> 02:19:02.913
Bro!

02:19:07.793 --> 02:19:08.585
Gwang-chul!

02:19:14.341 --> 02:19:16.010
What are you doing?

02:19:16.468 --> 02:19:19.263
This is mine! I'm taking it all!

02:19:19.430 --> 02:19:21.139
Stay back!

02:19:40.409 --> 02:19:41.660
Bro!

02:19:49.043 --> 02:19:50.169
Gwang-chul!

02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:04.350
The body of a man

02:20:04.350 --> 02:20:05.851
"32 YEAR OLD MAN'S BODY FOUND"

02:20:05.851 --> 02:20:07.603
who flung millions 10 days ago has been found.

02:20:07.603 --> 02:20:10.481
Found in the remote mountains...

02:20:10.481 --> 02:20:13.317
police identified the man as HUH Gwang-chul.

02:20:13.317 --> 02:20:16.236
He died of a gunshot wound.

02:20:22.326 --> 02:20:23.661
Have some soup.

02:20:27.414 --> 02:20:28.582
Back then...

02:20:29.375 --> 02:20:30.084
What?

02:20:30.584 --> 02:20:31.835
That extra card...

02:20:35.798 --> 02:20:37.508
Where'd you hide it?

02:20:42.888 --> 02:20:44.139
I ate it.

02:20:50.104 --> 02:20:51.313
Here.

02:20:56.527 --> 02:20:59.488
-It's for you.
- Thank you.

02:21:07.663 --> 02:21:09.665
My dear sister, Mina.

02:21:09.665 --> 02:21:13.252
A letter Gwang-chul wrote before he died came.

02:21:13.252 --> 02:21:16.171
I'm sorry for leaving you like this.

02:21:17.256 --> 02:21:22.261
Here's a map to a small gift for you.

02:21:24.555 --> 02:21:30.728
It should be enough for you two
to make a fresh start.

02:21:32.813 --> 02:21:40.237
He wrote how he did everything to protect us.

02:21:43.782 --> 02:21:46.118
It explained how he died.

02:22:14.313 --> 02:22:20.903
As I left home for Seoul,
I suddenly had a thought...

02:22:23.238 --> 02:22:25.365
Could I ever give up gambling?

02:22:29.536 --> 02:22:31.330
Ever heard of the Hands of God?

02:22:32.305 --> 02:22:38.808
