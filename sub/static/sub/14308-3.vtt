WEBVTT

00:11.633 --> 00:13.600
- ON YOUR LEFT!
- GOT HIM!

00:13.633 --> 00:15.200
ON YOUR RIGHT.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.833
YEAH!

00:17.867 --> 00:19.400
- I HEAR ZOMBIES
EXPLODING, TAYLOR.

00:19.433 --> 00:20.500
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN CHECK
AND SEE

00:20.533 --> 00:21.800
HOW CLEAN YOUR ROOM IS?

00:21.833 --> 00:23.400
- YOU COULD,
BUT I'D RATHER SEE YOU

00:23.433 --> 00:25.833
PAMPER YOURSELF
WITH A HOT BATH.

00:25.867 --> 00:28.967
- HOW ABOUT I PAMPER MYSELF
WITH A ROOM CHECK INSTEAD?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.500
- CHECK AWAY.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.433
MILES, I TOTALLY FORGOT
TO CLEAN MY BEDROOM.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.867
SHE'S GONNA FREAK.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.900
- LET ME GET THIS FOR YOU.

00:37.933 --> 00:39.367
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR A CHANCE TO CLEAN

00:39.400 --> 00:43.733
THAT PIGSTY FOR WEEKS.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.200
I CLEANED YOUR DESK,

00:45.233 --> 00:46.567
MADE YOUR BED,
AND VACUUMED YOUR RUG.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.200
QUICK QUESTION:
DO YOU PREFER YOUR CLOTHES

00:48.233 --> 00:50.433
ORGANIZED BY COLOR
OR PATTERN?

00:50.467 --> 00:54.600
- TAYLOR!

00:54.633 --> 00:57.200
YOUR ROOM...

00:57.233 --> 00:59.467
IS SPOTLESS.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.733
- OF COURSE IT IS.

01:00.767 --> 01:02.633
- WELL, I'M REALLY SORRY

01:02.667 --> 01:04.367
FOR DOUBTING YOU.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.967
I APPRECIATE HOW GOOD
YOU'VE BEEN ABOUT CHORES,

01:06.067 --> 01:08.933
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MOVE.

01:13.733 --> 01:15.767
HI, MILES.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.967
YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:17.067 --> 01:18.533
- MM. MM.

01:18.567 --> 01:20.533
- MILES, WHAT'S THAT
IN YOUR MOUTH?

01:20.567 --> 01:21.933
- MM-MM!

01:21.967 --> 01:24.800
AAH!

01:32.400 --> 01:36.833
OH, PSSH,
YOU MEAN THAT?

01:36.867 --> 01:39.367
- TAYLOR, WHY ARE YOUR CLOTHES
ALL IN MILES' MOUTH?

01:39.400 --> 01:44.200
IS THAT NOT WHERE THEY GO?

01:46.900 --> 01:50.233
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

01:50.267 --> 01:52.900
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

01:52.933 --> 01:55.200
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

01:55.233 --> 01:58.967
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

01:59.067 --> 02:01.467
* DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:01.500 --> 02:05.767
* BUT I GUESS YOU COULD CALL US
THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS *

02:05.800 --> 02:08.567
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:08.600 --> 02:11.267
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:11.300 --> 02:14.400
*

02:14.433 --> 02:17.433
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:21.833 --> 02:23.867
- WHAT MORE DO THOSE JUDGES
WANT FROM US?

02:23.900 --> 02:25.433
WE NAILED OUR ROUTINES,

02:25.467 --> 02:29.433
AND WE HAVE SUPER CUTE
MATCHING PONYTAILS.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.667
- I STILL SAY
UNTIL WE GET NEW UNIFORMS,

02:31.700 --> 02:33.533
WE'LL NEVER BE
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

02:33.567 --> 02:35.567
- I DON'T KNOW.
I LIKE MY UNIFORM.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.233
I THINK THE COFFEE BROWN COLOR
IS AN INTERESTING CHOICE.

02:39.267 --> 02:40.767
- THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WHITE.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.367
- EW!

02:44.733 --> 02:46.433
THE SCHOOL WILL NEVER PAY
FOR NEW ONES.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.767
THEY SPEND PLENTY OF MONEY

02:47.800 --> 02:49.200
ON THE SCIENCE FAIR.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.767
FIRST PRIZE
WOULD TOTALLY COVER

02:50.800 --> 02:52.333
THE COST OF NEW UNIFORMS.

02:52.367 --> 02:56.733
- EXCEPT ONE OF US
WOULD HAVE TO WIN.

02:56.767 --> 02:59.233
- YEAH, SOME SERIOUS BRAINS
ENTER THAT THING,

02:59.267 --> 03:00.633
AND THE KID WHO WEARS SPOCK EARS
HAS WON IT

03:00.667 --> 03:02.367
THREE YEARS IN A ROW.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.567
- SOON TO BE FOUR, EARTHLINGS!

03:13.500 --> 03:14.867
- LET'S FACE IT.

03:14.900 --> 03:18.333
IT'D TAKE A MIRACLE
TO WIN.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.933
- I THINK I LEFT MY PHONE
IN MY GYM BAG.

03:26.967 --> 03:28.333
MILES!

03:28.367 --> 03:30.567
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY GYM BAG?

03:30.600 --> 03:34.367
- IT'S NOT WEIRD.
IT'S JUST MY HEAD.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.233
LISTEN, I LOVE SCIENCE.

03:36.267 --> 03:37.833
PLUS I'M GREAT AT IT.

03:37.867 --> 03:39.533
AND I HAVE GHOSTING POWERS.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.633
FIRST PLACE
IS A SURE THING.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.400
- GUYS, I'M GONNA WIN
THE SCIENCE FAIR.

03:47.433 --> 03:49.333
- I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
YOU LIKED SCIENCE.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.567
I LOVE SCIENCE!

03:51.600 --> 03:55.233
YOU GOT BIOLOGY,
PHYSICS...

03:55.267 --> 03:59.633
THAT OTHER ONE
WHERE YOU MIX STUFF TOGETHER.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.867
- THERE YOU GO!

04:02.900 --> 04:04.867
THE POINT IS,
I'M SURE I CAN COME UP

04:04.900 --> 04:07.967
WITH SOMETHING SO GOOD,
IT WILL ALMOST SEEM...

04:08.067 --> 04:09.433
SUPERNATURAL.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.467
- YOU REALIZE
THE FAIR IS TOMORROW?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.500
- YES, I DO.

04:13.533 --> 04:16.600
UNIFORMS.

04:20.267 --> 04:21.767
LADIES, WE'RE INCHWORMS.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.233
TIME WE START LOOKING
LIKE IT.

04:24.267 --> 04:27.233
- TAYLOR, IF YOU PULL THIS OFF,
WE'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.467
- TOTALLY.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.633
FORGET WHAT?

04:33.333 --> 04:35.267
- HOW ABOUT THIS
FOR YOUR PROJECT?

04:37.833 --> 04:39.533
- WHOA!

04:43.400 --> 04:46.233
- MY FRIENDS ARE GOING
TO LOVE ME.

04:46.267 --> 04:48.933
IF YOU DO THIS, WE ARE GONNA
CRUSH THE SCIENCE FAIR.

04:48.967 --> 04:51.800
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.433
FAMILY MEETING.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.667
WAIT, HOW DO YOU SUMMON
GHOSTS AGAIN?

04:54.700 --> 04:57.900
- HEY, GHOSTS!

04:57.933 --> 04:59.800
- THANK YOU, FRANKIE.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.900
OH, SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

05:03.933 --> 05:05.667
OKAY, MAYBE A LITTLE.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.333
- FIRST THINGS FIRST.

05:07.367 --> 05:08.767
I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW

05:08.800 --> 05:10.533
THAT I'VE GIVEN THIS
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.267
- YOU'RE MOVING OUT!

05:13.300 --> 05:14.800
- NO.

05:14.833 --> 05:16.900
- YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT!

05:16.933 --> 05:18.400
- NO.

05:18.433 --> 05:19.933
I'VE MADE A DECISION
TO PUT A STOP

05:19.967 --> 05:21.967
TO ALL THE GHOSTING HELP
IN THIS HOUSE.

05:22.067 --> 05:23.700
WHY?

05:25.300 --> 05:26.500
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

05:26.533 --> 05:27.700
CAN I HAVE SOME CANDY?

05:27.733 --> 05:30.967
- NO.
WHY?

05:31.067 --> 05:32.700
- FOCUS, PEOPLE.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.467
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THE GHOST SHORTCUTS

05:34.500 --> 05:36.333
ARE AFFECTING THINGS
AROUND HERE.

05:36.367 --> 05:39.433
IT'S MAKING CERTAIN PEOPLE
VERY LAZY.

05:39.467 --> 05:42.633
YEAH, FRANKIE.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.667
- I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
WHICH PERSON

05:44.700 --> 05:47.633
AND GHOST
MICHELLE'S TALKING ABOUT.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.733
- BUT, DAD, I LIKE HELPING.

05:49.767 --> 05:54.267
- I'M OFFICIALLY DISGUSTED.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.900
- MICHELLE'S RIGHT.
SHORTCUTS ARE NOT THE ANSWER.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.600
- THANK YOU,
AND SINCE RAY AND I AGREE,

05:58.633 --> 06:00.833
IT'S SETTLED.
NO MORE GHOST HELP.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.933
- YOU GUYS CAN'T DO THIS!

06:02.967 --> 06:05.900
I JUST PROMISED MY FRIENDS
THAT I'D GET US NEW UNIFORMS.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.667
THEY'RE COUNTING ON ME
TO WIN.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.867
- THEN YOU BETTER
HIT THE BOOKS.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.267
BOYS, DO I HAVE YOUR WORD?

06:10.300 --> 06:11.733
- I HAVE NO INTEREST

06:11.767 --> 06:15.333
IN HELPING ANY OF YOU.

06:15.367 --> 06:18.633
- THANK YOU, LOUIE.
MILES?

06:18.667 --> 06:20.933
OKAY, I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

06:20.967 --> 06:25.500
NO MORE HELP.

06:25.533 --> 06:28.933
BETTER ALREADY.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.367
- DO I LOOK
LIKE I'M READY, SON?

06:38.567 --> 06:41.700
HOW ABOUT NOW?

06:41.733 --> 06:45.433
- NOPE.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.533
OKAY, OKAY.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.800
LET'S DO THIS.

06:53.633 --> 06:56.733
- NOTHING. BUH-BYE.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.167
- LOUIE.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.400
EVERY SUNDAY,
WE GET TOGETHER

06:59.433 --> 07:01.567
TO DO A LITTLE
FATHER AND SON BONDING.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.633
WE SNEAK AROUND,
FIND JUST THE RIGHT PERSON--

07:04.667 --> 07:09.333
- AND THEN SCARE THE POO
OUT OF 'EM.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.400
- THAT SOUNDS FUN.
I'M IN.

07:11.433 --> 07:13.400
- UH-UH, GHOSTS ONLY.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.700
NO FRANKIES.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.533
I CAN SCARE PEOPLE.

07:18.567 --> 07:21.400
- POOR, SILLY GIRL.
I LAUGH AT YOU.

07:21.433 --> 07:23.500
HA, HA...

07:23.533 --> 07:25.833
HA.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.733
- LOUIE, BE POLITE.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.733
- NO, IT'S FINE.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.867
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL,
I'LL LEAVE.

07:41.967 --> 07:45.300
- ARM ON THE FLOOR!
ARM ON THE FLOOR!

07:45.333 --> 07:47.400
- GOTCHA.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.233
- AH, COME--

07:50.267 --> 07:53.233
I GOTTA ADMIT,
THAT WAS NOT BAD.

07:53.267 --> 07:56.767
I'M THINKING IT MIGHT BE FUN
TO BRING FRANKIE ALONG.

07:58.233 --> 07:59.400
- SURE.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.833
THIS GIRL
MIGHT HAVE POTENTIAL.

08:04.667 --> 08:07.733
- SWEET!

08:10.600 --> 08:14.700
I BETTER OPEN THE DOOR.

08:14.733 --> 08:15.933
- STUPID ARM.

08:15.967 --> 08:18.633
OUT OF MY WAY.

08:18.667 --> 08:21.667
BAD FAKE ARM! BAD!

08:27.533 --> 08:28.700
- NO BIG DEAL.

08:28.733 --> 08:30.333
I JUST HAVE TO USE POTATOES
TO MAKE

08:30.367 --> 08:32.267
A SELF-REVOLVING
SOLAR SYSTEM.

08:32.300 --> 08:33.767
I CAN TOTALLY DO THIS.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.900
- AND I CAN TOTALLY WATCH YOU
WITHOUT FEELING TEMPTED

08:35.933 --> 08:38.433
TO GIVE ANY HELP.

08:38.467 --> 08:41.733
AT ALL.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.733
- WELL, THIS GOES HERE--

08:43.767 --> 08:47.800
- NUH--
N-NUH-UH.

08:47.833 --> 08:49.633
- UM...

08:49.667 --> 08:51.300
THIS GOES HERE.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.600
- N-N-N-N--

08:53.633 --> 08:55.667
- MILES!
THIS ISN'T HELPING.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.833
- GOOD, BECAUSE I MADE
A SOLEMN OATH NOT TO.

08:58.867 --> 09:00.500
NEXT TO MY BOW TIE COLLECTION,

09:00.533 --> 09:03.900
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME
THAN MY WORD.

09:03.933 --> 09:05.967
- LET'S TRY THIS.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.867
OW!

09:09.900 --> 09:12.233
- W--HEY, PROGRESS.

09:12.267 --> 09:14.433
AT LEAST THE POTATO
DIDN'T EXPLODE LIKE LAST...

09:16.300 --> 09:18.833
TIME.

09:18.867 --> 09:21.567
YOU'RE GONNA CLEAN THIS UP,
RIGHT?

09:24.967 --> 09:27.300
- I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S A BAD FUSE OR THE WIRING.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.733
ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE
A BAD OUTLET.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.500
MAYBE A SHORT CIRCUIT
OR A LONG CIRCUIT.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.500
IT'S HARD TO KNOW.

09:33.533 --> 09:37.900
- UNTIL YOU STOP YAPPING,
WE WON'T.

09:37.933 --> 09:40.467
- YOU'RE FUN.

09:42.267 --> 09:46.400
- ALL RIGHT, SCARIES,
I THINK WE FOUND OUR TARGET.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.867
THIS GUY'S A PIECE OF WORK.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.533
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO BACK OUT?

09:50.567 --> 09:53.267
- NO WAY.
BRING IT.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.800
- ALL RIGHT, LOUIE,
WHAT'S YOUR SCARE?

09:55.833 --> 09:58.267
- EASY. BATS.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.433
- HMM.
- A WHOLE SWARM OF THEM.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.533
AND THIRSTY FOR BLOOD.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.933
YEAH!
GO GET 'EM, SON.

10:10.567 --> 10:13.733
- BUTTERFLIES.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.567
- JUST LIKE THE ONES
I USED TO CATCH

10:16.600 --> 10:20.800
AS A BOY DURING MY SUMMERS
IN MAINE.

10:20.833 --> 10:23.867
I SHOULD CALL MOTHER.

10:23.900 --> 10:26.567
- NO!
- AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SON.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.433
I DON'T THINK THIS GUY'S
AN EASY SCARE.

10:30.467 --> 10:33.267
- BOO!

10:39.500 --> 10:41.600
- I THINK I'M DONE.

10:41.633 --> 10:44.700
- WOW!
IT'S A, UM...

10:44.733 --> 10:48.300
POTATO BALL FACTORY.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.600
- POTATO-POWERED
SOLAR SYSTEM.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.467
AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I PUSH THIS BUTTON.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.867
- CAREFUL, TAY,
THOSE ARE LIVE WIRES, AND--

10:57.733 --> 10:59.667
I NEVER DOUBTED YOU, SWEETIE.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.567
WOW.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.567
TAYLOR, AMAZING.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.300
- I THINK I ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT
TO WIN THIS THING.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.500
- OHH.

11:08.533 --> 11:09.967
- THANKS, MOM.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.933
DOING IT ALL ON MY OWN
FEELS A LOT BETTER

11:11.967 --> 11:13.467
THAN USING GHOST SHORTCUTS.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.300
MOM KNOWS HER STUFF.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.233
OH, IS IT JUST ME,

11:18.267 --> 11:20.067
OR IS SATURN'S RING TILTED
JUST A FRACTION TO THE--

11:20.067 --> 11:23.533
- MOM, IT'S PERFECT.
TRUST ME.

11:23.567 --> 11:25.467
BESIDES, I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON THIS ALL DAY.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.700
I'M EXHAUSTED.

11:26.733 --> 11:29.067
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S PERFECT.

11:33.533 --> 11:36.067
HMM.

11:38.067 --> 11:40.667
JUST A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.

11:42.567 --> 11:46.167
OKAY.
MICHELLE, DON'T PANIC.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.633
IT COULD BE WORSE.

11:52.667 --> 11:55.200
WORSE!

12:02.067 --> 12:04.700
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I DESTROYED
TAYLOR'S PROJECT.

12:04.733 --> 12:07.700
OH!
COME ON, COME ON.

12:07.733 --> 12:10.667
- I'M TELLING YOU, LILLY,
IT'S AWESOME.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.467
I TOLD YOU I'D WIN
AND GET US THOSE UNIFORMS.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.367
TELL THE GIRLS
IT'S IN THE BAG.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.800
YEAH, I'LL TEXT YOU
A PICTURE RIGHT NOW.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.400
MOM, WHY IS IT COVERED UP?

12:22.433 --> 12:23.867
- UH, TO PROTECT IT.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.733
FROM THE ELEMENTS.

12:25.767 --> 12:27.867
- I'M JUST TAKING
A PICTURE FOR LILLY.

12:27.900 --> 12:30.367
- NO! UH, WHAT IF LILLY

12:30.400 --> 12:33.200
SEES A PHOTO
AND STEALS YOUR IDEA?

12:33.233 --> 12:34.867
- LILLY ISN'T EVEN
IN THE SCIENCE FAIR.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.867
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THIS LILLY?

12:36.900 --> 12:39.767
IF THAT'S EVEN
HER REAL NAME.

12:41.533 --> 12:42.567
- I DON'T THINK
I LIKE YOUR TONE.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.600
OFF TO BED!

12:43.633 --> 12:45.433
- BUT IT'S ONLY 7:30.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.900
- YOU SAID YOU WERE TIRED.
DON'T CONTRADICT ME.

12:47.933 --> 12:52.700
- AND SOMEHOW, THE GHOSTS ARE
THE NORMAL ONES IN THE HOUSE.

12:52.733 --> 12:55.400
- OKAY.

12:58.733 --> 13:02.200
I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIX
TAYLOR'S PROJECT.

13:02.233 --> 13:06.667
- I THINK YOU'RE CONFUSED
ABOUT WHAT THE WORD "FIX" MEANS.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.367
- MILES, YOU CAN HELP ME.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.767
WHAT DO I DO FIRST?

13:10.800 --> 13:12.200
- MM-MM-MM,
MOVE TO A NEW CITY

13:12.233 --> 13:15.167
AND CHANGE YOUR NAME
TO JANET?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.367
- OH, COME ON.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.500
I

13:19.533 --> 13:21.500
- MICHELLE, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I WANT

13:21.533 --> 13:23.567
TO HELP TAYLOR,
BUT YOU SAID NO MORE GHOST HELP,

13:23.600 --> 13:24.767
AND I GAVE MY WORD.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.567
- OH, TO ME.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.400
AND NOW I'M SAYING
IT'S OKAY.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.133
- SORRY, BUT WE MADE
AN ORAL CONTRACT.

13:31.167 --> 13:34.367
- PFFT!

13:34.400 --> 13:38.733
OH, I NEVER KID ABOUT
LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENTS.

13:38.767 --> 13:41.767
- FINE, I'LL--
I'LL FIX IT MYSELF.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.333
OKAY, OKAY, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

13:52.367 --> 13:53.533
WHAT'S FLAT...

13:53.567 --> 13:54.733
- AND BROWN

13:54.767 --> 13:57.900
AND SITS OUTSIDE
YOUR FRONT DOOR, CRYING?

13:57.933 --> 14:00.367
- SCAREDY-MAT.
- OH!

14:00.400 --> 14:02.833
YOU DO KNOW THEM ALL.

14:04.533 --> 14:08.767
I'M OUTTA HERE.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.600
- I'M GIDDY.

14:13.633 --> 14:15.800
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:15.833 --> 14:18.833
- GOOD QUESTION.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK MY DAD?

14:18.867 --> 14:20.667
- YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.

14:21.933 --> 14:23.733
DID MY DAD TELL YOU
TO SAY THAT?

14:23.767 --> 14:25.667
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE
ANY SENSE!

14:25.700 --> 14:28.700
- DAD-STEALER.

14:33.833 --> 14:37.600
- I'D LIKE SOME ALONE TIME,
PLEASE.

14:39.733 --> 14:41.167
- YOO-HOO!

14:41.200 --> 14:43.233
- MY DAD AND MILES
AREN'T HERE.

14:43.267 --> 14:46.133
- ACTUALLY, LOUIE,
I CAME UP HERE TO SEE YOU.

14:46.167 --> 14:47.700
I MADE LEMON SQUARES.

14:47.733 --> 14:49.867
- I DON'T EAT LEMON SQUARES.

14:49.900 --> 14:53.367
I'M AN ALL-POWERFUL GHOST.

14:57.533 --> 14:59.200
- IT RELAXES ME.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.567
I HAD A HARD DAY--

15:00.600 --> 15:02.833
NOT THAT ANYONE
AROUND HERE CARES.

15:02.867 --> 15:05.933
- AW, SWEETIE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:05.967 --> 15:07.400
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

15:07.433 --> 15:10.633
CAN YOU PLEASE
STATE YOUR PURPOSE?

15:10.667 --> 15:11.833
- FINE.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.400
I'VE BEEN UP FOR HOURS

15:13.433 --> 15:14.833
REBUILDING
TAYLOR'S SCIENCE PROJECT.

15:14.867 --> 15:16.300
I PUT EVERYTHING
BACK IN THE RIGHT SPOT,

15:16.333 --> 15:18.567
BUT THE PLANETS
STILL WON'T ROTATE.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.567
- SO...

15:20.600 --> 15:22.467
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:22.500 --> 15:25.767
- I NEED
YOUR GHOSTING ABILITIES.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.533
- YOU NEED
MY GHOSTING ABILITIES?

15:28.567 --> 15:31.633
- YES.
- FINALLY!

15:31.667 --> 15:34.333
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY APPRECIATES
MY TALENTS.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.333
- YEAH, I'LL DO IT.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.533
- WAIT.

15:38.567 --> 15:41.600
YOU SAID WE COULDN'T HELP.
IS THIS A TRICK?

15:41.633 --> 15:43.200
- OH, NO.
I'M A MOTHER.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.367
WE SAY A LOT OF GOOFY THINGS.
GET USED TO IT.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.900
- I'M NEXT.
IS EVERYBODY HERE?

15:51.933 --> 15:53.300
- RAY'S GOT A GIG
WITH HIS GHOST BAND,

15:53.333 --> 15:54.500
BUT HE SAYS GOOD LUCK.

15:54.533 --> 15:56.167
WE'RE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.133
WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT!

16:00.733 --> 16:03.333
WHAT I MEANT WAS, "WHEE!"

16:03.367 --> 16:05.967
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

16:06.067 --> 16:09.767
WHEE!

16:09.800 --> 16:12.367
- WOW, TAYLOR,
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.133
- I LOVE HOW YOU MADE
THE PLANETS ROUND.

16:15.167 --> 16:18.667
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.500
- WOW, YOU CAN SEE
THE CHICKEN WIRE

16:20.533 --> 16:22.767
COMING OUT OF THIS NOSE.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.167
AMATEUR HOUR.

16:27.567 --> 16:29.133
- HEY, LOUIE,
YOU STILL MAD AT ME?

16:32.567 --> 16:33.767
- I DON'T GET IT.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.333
I DO.

16:35.367 --> 16:37.800
LITTLE GUY'S JEALOUS.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.433
- IT'S BECAUSE HE TRIED
TO IMPRESS MY DAD

16:39.467 --> 16:41.133
WITH HIS GHOSTING ABILITIES,

16:41.167 --> 16:43.467
AND THEN YOU CAME IN
AND OUTDID HIM.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.300
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.400
OH, NOW I FEEL AWFUL.

16:48.433 --> 16:51.567
I'M GONNA GO FIND A WAY
TO MAKE IT UP TO HIM.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.167
RIGHT AFTER I FINISH FINDING OUT
WHERE BOOGERS COME FROM.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.667
- UP NEXT,
WE HAVE TAYLOR HATHAWAY.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.833
- THANK YOU, JUDGES.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.967
MY PROJECT IS A SCALE MODEL
OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,

17:04.067 --> 17:06.267
FEATURING THE SUN, MOON,
AND ALL OUR PLANETS.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.967
BUT THAT'S ONLY HALF OF IT,

17:08.067 --> 17:10.200
BECAUSE IT ROTATES
IN EACH PLANET'S ORBIT.

17:10.233 --> 17:13.500
IT DOES SO HARNESSING THE POWER
OF ORDINARY POTATOES.

17:17.767 --> 17:20.267
- LET OPERATION
"LOUIE IS AWESOME,

17:20.300 --> 17:23.233
AND FRANKIE IS JUST
A DOO-DOO HEAD" BEGIN.

17:23.267 --> 17:26.633
CAME UP WITH THE NAME
MYSELF.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.267
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HELPING
TAYLOR'S PROJECT.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.767
- STAY OUT OF THIS,
BOY SCOUT.

17:33.267 --> 17:34.800
- BUT LOUIE'S
A BEGINNER GHOST.

17:34.833 --> 17:38.467
HIS POWERS
ARE A LITTLE...IFFY.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.733
LOOK AT THOSE SUCKERS SPIN.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.133
- UH, THAT'S A LITTLE FAST.

17:47.167 --> 17:51.467
SO THIS CONCLUDES
OUR DEMONSTRATION.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.133
- OKAY, LOUIE,
EASE UP, BIG GUY.

17:54.167 --> 17:55.500
- OKAY, OKAY.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.967
UH-OH.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.800
- UM, I THINK
IT'S OVERHEATING.

18:06.833 --> 18:09.500
- UH, COMPLETELY.

18:15.633 --> 18:17.767
- I THINK IT'S GONNA BLOW!

18:23.900 --> 18:25.733
- OH!

18:25.767 --> 18:28.400
- OH!

18:33.833 --> 18:36.833
- GLOBAL WARMING.
I THINK I MADE MY POINT.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.633
- CHIN UP, TAYLOR.

18:40.667 --> 18:44.167
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER WHEN WE GET
THOSE BRAND-NEW UNIFORMS.

18:50.533 --> 18:52.500
- I THOUGHT
I PUT THIS TOGETHER PERFECTLY.

18:52.533 --> 18:54.200
- YOU DID.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.900
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

18:55.933 --> 18:58.767
I LET THE TEAM DOWN.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.867
- SO...
FUNNY STORY.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.533
LAST NIGHT,
I BROKE YOUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

19:07.567 --> 19:11.667
AND THEN I SORT OF GOT
GHOST HELP TO FIX IT.

19:16.867 --> 19:18.933
MOM, HOW COULD YOU BREAK
YOUR OWN RULE?

19:18.967 --> 19:20.733
- I AM SO SORRY, HONEY.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.967
I WANTED YOU TO WIN
SO BADLY.

19:23.067 --> 19:24.700
I-I MADE A MISTAKE.

19:24.733 --> 19:28.600
AND THEN THAT MISTAKE TURNED
INTO A REAL DOOZY.

19:28.633 --> 19:31.200
IT'S MY FAULT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET THAT TROPHY.

19:31.233 --> 19:32.833
- WHO CARES
ABOUT THE TROPHY?

19:32.867 --> 19:34.733
I WANTED NEW UNIFORMS.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.700
I WANTED TO COME THROUGH
FOR THE GIRLS.

19:36.733 --> 19:38.367
- I FEEL TERRIBLE, BABY.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.467
I'D DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

19:47.967 --> 19:49.533
- OH, ON YOUR LEFT!

19:49.567 --> 19:51.200
- GOT HIM!
ON YOUR RIGHT.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.567
- HIYAH!
- NICE.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.733
MOM, YOU'RE AWESOME.

19:55.767 --> 19:57.767
THE GIRLS CAN'T WAIT TO GET
THEIR NEW UNIFORMS.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.367
- WELL, THEY MIGHT GET
DONE FASTER

19:59.400 --> 20:01.500
IF YOU'D JUMP ON OVER HERE
AND HELP ME.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.600
- THINK I'M GONNA LET YOU
FLY SOLO ON THAT ONE, MOM.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.733
BUT JUST THINK OF HOW GOOD
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL

20:06.767 --> 20:10.367
AFTER DOING IT ON YOUR OWN.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.867
SORRY, GHOST GIG WENT LATE.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.500
DOUBLE ENCORE.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.833
BEN FRANKLIN THREW
HIS POWDERED WIG ONSTAGE.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.633
SO HOW'D THE SCIENCE FAIR GO?

20:19.667 --> 20:21.600
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE
TO HEAR THIS, RAY,

20:21.633 --> 20:25.333
BUT THERE WERE
GHOST SHORTCUTS USED.

20:26.833 --> 20:28.533
I THOUGHT MICHELLE AND I
WERE PERFECTLY CLEAR

20:28.567 --> 20:30.233
ON WHAT WE EXPECTED.

20:30.267 --> 20:33.200
- I'M NOT SURE
WE WERE PERFECTLY CLEAR.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.133
FINE, IT WAS ME.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.367
I ASKED FOR LOUIE'S HELP
WHEN I RUINED TAYLOR'S PROJECT.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.233
- I SEE.
I NEED DETAILS.

20:40.267 --> 20:43.333
- I DON'T THINK POPS NEEDS
TO HEAR ABOUT ALL THAT.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.867
HE LOOKS...TIRED.

20:45.900 --> 20:48.200
- NO, HE SHOULD KNOW.

20:48.233 --> 20:51.567
LOUIE PUT ON THE MOST EPIC SCARE
EVER AT THE SCIENCE FAIR.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.533
- I GUESS I DID SEND
THE WHOLE PLACE RUNNING.

20:55.567 --> 20:57.133
- IT WAS WILD.

20:57.167 --> 20:59.567
THERE WAS SCREAMING,
EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.533
I HEAR THEY EVEN HAD
TO CALL IN JANITORS

21:01.567 --> 21:04.200
FROM OTHER STATES
TO HELP WITH THE CLEANUP.

21:04.233 --> 21:08.333
- LOUIE, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.333
JANITORS FROM OTHER STATES?

21:11.367 --> 21:13.400
THAT'S MY BOY!

21:13.433 --> 21:15.600
HEY, YOU KNOW, I HEAR
THE MEAN DELIVERY GUY

21:15.633 --> 21:17.367
IS STOPPING BY THE BAKERY
TOMORROW.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.767
YOU TWO UP
FOR SOME MORE SCARING?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.833
- NOT ME,
I CAN'T MEASURE UP,

21:21.867 --> 21:24.500
ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT I SAW
OUT OF LOUIE TONIGHT.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.833
- HMM. OKAY.
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.367
GUESS TOMORROW WILL BE
JUST US GUYS.

21:34.267 --> 21:36.133
- THANKS.

21:36.167 --> 21:39.400
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!

21:46.700 --> 21:49.700
- BECAUSE I'M ALMOST...

21:49.733 --> 21:51.700
DONE.

21:51.733 --> 21:54.633
HMM!
SO PRETTY COOL, RIGHT?

21:54.667 --> 21:56.200
- THEY'RE AWESOME.

21:56.233 --> 22:01.133
BUT WHO ARE
THE FIGHTING INCHWARTS?

22:02.833 --> 22:05.133
- YOU DIDN'T DO THAT
ON ALL OF THEM, DID YOU?

22:05.167 --> 22:08.500
- OH.
PLEASE LEAVE, SWEETHEART.
