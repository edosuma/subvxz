00:22.390 --> 00:24.423
Horton, H-O-R-T-O-N.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.457
That's the guy
you should have brought in here.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.360
Miss, I've been here
40 minutes.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.095
I just need to know
where she is.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.397
I told you
before, sir--

00:31.399 --> 00:33.399
I have to check
with Admitting.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.234
This is ridiculous.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.602
NURSE:
Get a doctor, stat!

00:36.604 --> 00:38.437
MAN:
I need some help
in here please! Now!

00:38.439 --> 00:40.372
She's turning blue.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.507
She can't breathe.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.608
Get the ambu-bag.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.276
No pulse. Call a code!

00:44.278 --> 00:47.513
Come on, let's go, move!

00:47.515 --> 00:49.481
I need a line in!

00:49.483 --> 00:51.450
Get the defibrillator.

00:51.452 --> 00:54.453
You knew that wasn't right.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.427
You can't go in there, sir.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.394
Call a guard.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.063
Sir!

01:05.833 --> 01:07.199
No pulse.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.267
Curette the I.V.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.543
No response.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.577
Get me adrenaline.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.610
Excuse us, please,
wait outside.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.612
We're doing everything
we can.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.613
What's going on?

01:21.615 --> 01:23.148
That's my daughter.
Please.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.550
Please, you can't
come in here.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.617
This is off limits.
Don't even try!
What's going on?

01:25.619 --> 01:31.290
The last blood gases.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.658
Let's call it.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.460
23:17.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.662
Oh, my God,
what the hell happened?

01:36.664 --> 01:39.298
Your daughter
had cardiac arrest.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.566
Well, resuscitate her!
Defib her!

01:40.568 --> 01:43.569
Please, please,
your daughter is dead.

01:43.571 --> 01:44.503
Where you going?
I don't get this.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.171
She only had
a sore throat.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.239
This is insane!
Some help, please.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.574
Come on, pal....

01:48.576 --> 01:50.509
No, guys, she only
had a sore throat!

01:50.511 --> 01:51.927
She didn't even have a fever!

01:51.928 --> 01:53.344
She only came in
for a prescription!

01:53.347 --> 01:55.247
I don't understand, guys...

01:56.584 --> 02:00.652
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

03:20.234 --> 03:21.333
<i> Where</i> was
she murdered?

03:21.335 --> 03:23.735
I told you--
Urban Medical Center.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.370
I'm sorry, Mr. Morton.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.239
I'm a little confused.

03:27.241 --> 03:30.676
Your daughter was killed
at the hospital?

03:30.678 --> 03:32.211
Yeah, in the emergency room.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.712
And I want to swear
out a murder complaint

03:33.714 --> 03:35.547
against the resident
in charge of it.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.916
This resident was treating her?

03:37.918 --> 03:40.652
No, killing her.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.988
But she was
at the hospital

03:42.990 --> 03:44.256
for treatment.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.924
Yeah, a sore throat,
muscle aches.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.360
She only went in
to get a prescription

03:48.362 --> 03:50.963
for some antibiotics.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.664
Well, sometimes people

03:52.666 --> 03:55.267
are a lot sicker than they look.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.702
Listen to me--

03:56.704 --> 03:58.403
I was a medic in Vietnam.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.838
I know who's dying
and who isn't.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.007
My daughter was not that sick.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.375
Somebody in that emergency room

04:03.377 --> 04:04.810
did something
that killed her.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.312
Who does he want
to bring charges against?

04:07.314 --> 04:09.014
The resident in charge
of the emergency room.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.582
Oh, come on, Max.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.985
People die
in hospital emergency rooms

04:12.987 --> 04:14.886
every hour of every day.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.889
Now that may indeed be tragic,
but it is not criminal.

04:17.891 --> 04:21.026
Unless somebody was
criminally negligent.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.394
And how the hell
would Mr. Morton know

04:22.396 --> 04:23.862
if that had happened?

04:23.864 --> 04:26.031
He was a medic
in Vietnam.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.801
He says she wasn't
sick enough to die.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.037
He was very convincing.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.774
I'm not saying no.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.347
I just had my first day off

04:42.349 --> 04:44.049
in two weeks.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.718
There is a world out there.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.920
LOGAN:
You're the intern who
treated a young girl

04:48.922 --> 04:51.323
named, uh, Suzanne Morton.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.992
Yeah, she's the last patient
I admitted before I took off.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.296
Bronchitis. She dramatized her
symptoms a bit.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.665
So I ordered a chest x-ray

04:59.667 --> 05:01.400
and put her aside
to wait for a bed.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.834
Why?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.836
Right now we're doing
a routine investigation

05:04.838 --> 05:05.837
of her death.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.373
Death?

05:08.375 --> 05:09.975
Why, she died?

05:09.977 --> 05:12.944
You sound surprised.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.083
Don't people croak
here every day?

05:20.788 --> 05:23.355
Well, she wasn't that sick.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.858
You don't die from bronchitis.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.761
Suzanne Morton,
she had pneumonia.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.697
The sputum examination
and blood culture

05:31.699 --> 05:32.864
were indicative.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.399
We discussed it
during rounds.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.034
Pneumonia, huh?

05:36.036 --> 05:38.437
Lot of people die
of that these days?

05:38.439 --> 05:39.971
When it's complicated
by chemical pneumonitis.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.973
Sometimes.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.509
The patient was feverish
and fell unconscious.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.378
She must have aspirated
some of the contents

05:46.380 --> 05:47.779
of her stomach.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.082
Stomach acid and lungs
do not mix well.

05:50.084 --> 05:52.017
This can happen fast?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.352
Yes, it can.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.820
Excuse me.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.358
Hmm. Busy woman.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.062
Yeah, so busy she can't
even make eye contact.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.031
Suzanne Morton.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.768
Yes, if you see Mr. Morton,
please extend my condolences.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.404
Dr. Raza, were you on rounds
when they reached her?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.106
Yes, yes, that is right.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.874
I came right away.

06:17.111 --> 06:18.410
Why?

06:18.412 --> 06:20.045
I didn't think
she was that sick.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.113
We've heard bronchitis,
maybe pneumonia.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.449
No, no, no,
she was very sick.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.784
She should have been
in the intensive care unit.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.819
Unfortunately,
there were no beds.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.455
In my country,
we accept death.

06:30.457 --> 06:34.826
But here, you're expected
to live forever.

06:34.828 --> 06:38.497
You ever hold a human heart
in your hands?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.532
Only mine.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.868
What year are you in?

06:42.870 --> 06:43.935
Third.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.221
We go hands on.

06:46.222 --> 06:48.506
Did you ever lay your hands
on Suzanne Morton?

06:48.509 --> 06:49.808
The pneumonia.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.109
I spent 40 minutes

06:51.111 --> 06:52.844
trying to find an orderly

06:52.846 --> 06:54.930
to take her to
intensive care.

06:54.931 --> 06:57.015
On the way back, I passed a
gunshot wound through the neck

06:57.017 --> 06:58.817
with a six-inch exit.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.852
You ever see
one of those?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.454
Yeah, well, they're
not so exciting

07:02.456 --> 07:04.022
when you run into one
in a crack house.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.924
Financial advisor needed in E.R.
WOMAN (<i> over P.A.</i> ):

07:07.127 --> 07:08.927
GREEVEY:
Tell me some more.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.128
This guy in the
emergency room--

07:10.130 --> 07:12.431
must have been his
daughter was sick--

07:12.433 --> 07:15.033
he's going nuts, yelling,
"Why didn't they do this?
Why didn't they do this?"

07:15.035 --> 07:16.902
Sounded like he knew
his way around.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.136
Around the hospital?

07:18.138 --> 07:20.472
Around sick people.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.442
Those doctors...
something wasn't right.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.010
The way they looked.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.112
Worried? Excited?

07:27.114 --> 07:30.081
Embarrassed.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.052
Embarrassed.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.223
Does this make sense
to you, Max?

07:38.225 --> 07:40.058
Sure, she had bronchitis.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.493
She had pneumonia.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.794
She was fine
when she got here,

07:42.796 --> 07:44.029
she was dying
when she got here.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.630
God-like pronouncements

07:45.632 --> 07:48.934
sound like normal
medical procedure to me.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.505
So, Max, what's your problem?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.540
Meaning?

07:55.542 --> 07:58.043
Meaning your attitude.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.110
'82.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.912
My partner and I

08:00.914 --> 08:03.181
go into this fleabag S.R.O.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.550
to pick up
some junkie bank robber.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.252
I'm putting the cuffs on him.

08:07.254 --> 08:11.156
His girlfriend comes from
out of nowhere, jumps me.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.558
We're rolling around, I hit my
head against the radiator.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.928
You know, it hurt like hell,
but it's no big deal.

08:18.499 --> 08:22.133
Week later,
I start slurring words.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.506
I go see a neurologist--

08:27.508 --> 08:30.509
quote, "Top guy in Manhattan."

08:30.511 --> 08:33.044
He looks at me, he says,
"I want you in the hospital.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.081
I'm going to do a C.A.T. scan."

08:36.083 --> 08:39.017
Yeah, well,
I would definitely freak.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.219
Next day,
Dr. God comes in

08:41.221 --> 08:44.656
says, "you have
an inoperable brain tumor

08:44.658 --> 08:46.091
in your cerebellum."

08:46.093 --> 08:48.994
He said it like
he was telling me

08:48.996 --> 08:51.997
they'd be serving chicken
for dinner.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.131
We decided to get

08:53.133 --> 08:54.900
a second opinion.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.235
I go see
another "top" neurologist.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.037
He does another C.A.T. scan.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.705
He comes in and says

09:00.707 --> 09:04.209
"You don't have a brain tumor
in your cerebellum.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.312
You have
a subdural hematoma here."

09:10.217 --> 09:12.284
A month later, I was fine.

09:12.286 --> 09:15.220
Hey, at least he caught
the mistake.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.889
All right?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.190
Yeah.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.963
And when they don't,
they just bury them.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.667
Dr. Auster will see you now.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.937
Let's go see
the chief of medicine.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.205
I'm sure he'll be godlike too.

09:34.207 --> 09:39.578
A diagnostician
is like a detective.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.279
As a matter of fact,

09:41.281 --> 09:43.281
Conan Doyle
modeled Sherlock Holmes

09:43.283 --> 09:45.684
on Dr. Joseph Bell.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.253
You solve every case
you work on?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.288
We can tell a felony
from a traffic ticket.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.024
A patient walks in
with a headache.

09:53.026 --> 09:56.027
Does she have
a subarachnoid hemorrhage,

09:56.029 --> 09:59.030
a berry aneurysm,
a retro-orbital tumor

09:59.032 --> 10:01.299
or does she just have
a headache?

10:01.301 --> 10:06.004
Do you give here an aspirin,
or do you saw open her skull?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.239
You make this speech
at funerals?

10:08.241 --> 10:11.343
AUSTER:
I saw that girl in
the emergency room on rounds.

10:11.345 --> 10:14.312
She was in the hands
of competent staff.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.031
The girl is dead.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.749
Well, people like
to believe that medicine

10:17.751 --> 10:19.017
is pure science.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.386
Medicine<i> is</i> a science.

10:21.388 --> 10:26.024
But doctors know
it's also a lottery.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.192
See what I mean?

10:27.194 --> 10:29.194
The guy is chief of medicine

10:29.196 --> 10:31.663
and all he could
come up with is

10:31.665 --> 10:33.732
"It's a lottery."

10:35.969 --> 10:37.736
Proceed, Sherlock.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.346
What do you do
when you make a mistake--

10:48.348 --> 10:50.115
use Wite-Out?

10:50.117 --> 10:52.217
Uh-uh, you cross it out
and initial it.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.752
This ain't no
letter to Dear Abby.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.286
These charts got
to show everything

10:55.288 --> 10:59.124
or there could be
serious legal repercussions.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.993
Serious legal repercussions,
that's what we have here.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.430
Somebody used Wite-Out
on Suzanne Morton's chart.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.803
Now, on top
of the Wite-Out

11:11.805 --> 11:15.173
it says "acetaminophen,"
a common every day painkiller.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.941
But underneath
the Wite-Out...

11:17.911 --> 11:21.112
it said "meperidine."

11:21.114 --> 11:22.781
That's a narcotic.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.782
Big difference.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.784
Third-rate cover-up.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.785
Whoever did it
probably wasn't expecting

11:27.788 --> 11:29.955
an investigation.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.123
Whoever wrote merpidine
also wrote acetaminophen.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.460
Look at the "e's"
in acetaminophen.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.095
See, italic,
cursive penmanship

11:37.097 --> 11:40.799
an English style,
popular in the colonies.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.868
See the shape and the angle
of the loop?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.805
Now, it matches notations
that were here,

11:46.807 --> 11:48.840
here,

11:48.842 --> 11:50.241
and here,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.911
all of them
initialed "E.R."

11:52.913 --> 11:54.813
Emergency room?

11:54.815 --> 11:57.048
Eqbal Raza.

11:58.452 --> 12:00.852
MAN:
<i> and a low-grade fever.</i>

12:00.854 --> 12:01.853
<i> Nothing more.</i>

12:01.855 --> 12:03.488
I gave her an antibiotic

12:03.490 --> 12:04.856
and an antihistamine.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.492
No doctor would have done
anything more.

12:07.494 --> 12:11.029
Sounds like you're
on solid ground.

12:11.031 --> 12:15.133
Her psychiatrist had her
on phenelzine sulfate.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.969
She was seeing a shrink?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.438
She'd been depressed
since her mother's death.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.874
When did that happen?

12:22.876 --> 12:25.393
Last year.

12:25.394 --> 12:27.911
She developed peritonitis
after a hysterectomy.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.918
This, uh... fenal...

12:33.920 --> 12:35.086
what is it?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.021
Phenelzine...
Doctor?

12:37.023 --> 12:39.124
Miss Rossi is ready.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.526
Thank you.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.927
Phenelzine sulfate,
an antidepressant.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.497
A strong one.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.237
The patient died,
but don't worry.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.073
The doctor is doing just fine.

12:57.043 --> 13:00.211
Okay, the tox screen
shows acetaminophen.

13:00.213 --> 13:04.149
It shows aspirin,
and it shows an antihistamine.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.217
So there's no sign
of meperidine?

13:06.219 --> 13:09.220
We ran the standard
gas and chromatography.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.790
We know the girl
was on something

13:11.792 --> 13:12.991
called phenelzine.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.093
Not a trace.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.194
Meperidine, phenelzine,
recreational drugs--

13:17.197 --> 13:18.897
do another tox screen.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.933
I think you're wasting
your nickel.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.936
Nobody takes meperidine
<i>and</i> phenelzine,

13:24.938 --> 13:28.072
unless they want to risk
ending up here.

13:28.074 --> 13:31.543
It can be
a fatal combination.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.014
I was exhausted.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.982
I just came off
the cancer ward.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.585
I wrote meperidine
without thinking,

13:40.587 --> 13:42.954
but I gave her acetaminophen.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.989
What about the Wite-Out?

13:44.991 --> 13:48.993
There is paperwork required
when you write a narcotic,

13:48.995 --> 13:51.129
and I did not have time
for that.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.564
Dr. Raza,

13:52.566 --> 13:54.199
you just confessed

13:54.201 --> 13:57.101
to falsifying
hospital records.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.537
That's a Class E felony.

13:59.539 --> 14:03.374
When they look at me here,
they see an Indian or a Paki.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.977
They don't even know
the difference.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.379
We're all supposed
to be bad doctors.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.632
You ask anybody.

14:10.633 --> 14:12.884
I have to be twice as good
as everybody else

14:12.886 --> 14:16.621
just so they will think
I am<i> as</i> good as everybody else.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.990
My children want
to stay in this country,

14:18.992 --> 14:20.158
my wife wants
to stay in this country,

14:20.160 --> 14:22.260
and to stay,
all I have to do

14:22.262 --> 14:24.362
is to be perfect
all the time.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.398
Well, you fell a little
short of perfection

14:27.400 --> 14:29.167
on Suzanne Morton's chart.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.969
It was a simple mistake.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.136
Really?

14:32.138 --> 14:34.606
If the toxicologist
finds meperidine

14:34.608 --> 14:36.040
in Suzanne Morton's body,

14:36.042 --> 14:39.644
you'll be lucky if
you're only deported.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.013
please report to Admitting
Dr. Fleming,
WOMAN (<i> over P.A.</i> ):

14:42.015 --> 14:44.415
Cancer Care Center.
in the Comprehensive

14:44.417 --> 14:46.117
Have fun.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.185
Thanks.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.122
Max, dig this.

14:51.124 --> 14:55.059
Now, here's a guy
who swallowed his false teeth,

14:55.061 --> 14:58.029
and then they bit through
his intestines.

14:58.031 --> 15:02.200
What did Dr. Raza prescribe--
a good flossing?

15:02.202 --> 15:04.235
Oh, here we go.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.906
Mistake, crossed out,
initialed.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.140
Same here.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.075
You know, look at this.

15:11.077 --> 15:14.279
We could be holding in our hands
the evidence to a mass murder

15:14.281 --> 15:16.948
and we wouldn't even know it.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.117
All these have
evening rounds

15:19.119 --> 15:21.052
at 6:00 to 6:30,

15:21.054 --> 15:24.188
and the night that
Suzanne Morton died,

15:24.190 --> 15:26.357
rounds were after 9:00.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.127
If you hear hoof beats,

15:29.129 --> 15:32.130
it's probably a horse,
not a zebra.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.366
Old medical school saying.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.202
Students tend
to find exotic diseases

15:38.204 --> 15:39.938
in ordinary symptoms.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.472
They need to be reminded

15:41.474 --> 15:44.342
that most things are
what they appear to be.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.078
You, gentlemen,
are on a zebra hunt.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.649
Well, either a zebra
or a horse using Wite-Out.

15:51.651 --> 15:55.086
Maybe Dr. Raza made
a mistake on the chart.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.089
Maybe he made a mistake
in the emergency room.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.993
You trust Dr. Raza,
don't you?

16:01.995 --> 16:03.227
Offered him a job.

16:03.229 --> 16:06.230
Wrote a letter
to immigration this morning.

16:06.232 --> 16:10.735
Strange time
to be hiring the guy.

16:10.737 --> 16:15.006
A good doctor is a good doctor.

16:15.008 --> 16:18.109
GREEVEY:
What time were rounds
that night?

16:18.111 --> 16:20.161
Sometime after 6:00.

16:20.162 --> 16:22.212
They stand around gabbing,
and we're trying

16:22.215 --> 16:25.450
to keep some poor jerk
from bleeding to death.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.019
So what happened that night?
Why were rounds so late?

16:28.021 --> 16:31.055
We waited
for the chief of medicine.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.123
Dr. Auster?

16:32.125 --> 16:34.125
God on high descending.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.628
Well, he descended late.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.130
He said he'd been delayed
at some retirement party

16:39.132 --> 16:41.132
for one of the service chiefs.

16:41.134 --> 16:44.135
had a good time.
Seemed like Dr. Auster

16:44.137 --> 16:46.104
What do you mean?

16:46.106 --> 16:50.775
It smelled like
he had been drinking.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.411
a hospital blood drive
There will be
WOMAN (<i> over P.A.</i> ):

16:53.413 --> 16:55.179
we need volunteers.
beginning next Monday;

17:00.053 --> 17:03.221
The hospital wanted
to lay out cheese in a can

17:03.223 --> 17:05.023
and white wine from Bulgaria.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.758
So, I had the party catered.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.428
Duck-liver pate,
beluga malossol caviar.

17:10.430 --> 17:14.799
Oh, yes, anesthesiology
has been very good to me.

17:14.801 --> 17:18.102
Did Dr. Auster
have a good time?

17:18.104 --> 17:19.303
Oh, I hope so.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.140
The caviar cost
400 bucks a pound.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.142
Did Dr. Auster
have a drink?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.377
Oh, yes, that's
why I had a bar.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.447
Happy Hour Catering,
25 bucks a head.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.053
You guys just
supply bartenders?

17:35.055 --> 17:37.055
We supply bartenders,
barmaids if you want them,

17:37.057 --> 17:39.157
ice, glasses, napkins, mixers.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.158
Booze?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.459
You supply, you save.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.127
You work the hospital job?

17:43.129 --> 17:46.164
I was there, two waitresses,
and Rory, another bartender.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.398
You remember this guy?

17:49.135 --> 17:51.102
Yeah, Jim.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.503
No, Ed--

17:52.505 --> 17:54.272
Edward Auster.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.407
No, no, Jim... Green.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.509
The bourbon?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.211
That's what he drank--

18:00.213 --> 18:03.081
on the rocks,
one every five minutes.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.115
I can smell it.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.350
Somebody gave her
the wrong drugs.

18:06.352 --> 18:09.253
I don't know if it
was Gunga Din or Auster,

18:09.255 --> 18:11.589
but one of them
screwed the pooch.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.560
Mike, you look like
you got a problem.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.829
All I know about hospitals

18:17.831 --> 18:20.565
is that my father
is still walking today

18:20.567 --> 18:23.501
because he had
a heart transplant in one

18:23.503 --> 18:24.869
seven years ago.

18:24.871 --> 18:30.608
I'm not saying
all doctors are bad.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.810
99% of them
are solid pros.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.245
It's the rotten
one percent--

18:34.247 --> 18:36.280
to quote our friend Auster--

18:36.282 --> 18:38.349
that make it a lottery.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.418
You bet your life.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.486
Come on, Max, you ain't exactly
a fan of the profession.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.455
I just want them held
to the same standards

18:44.457 --> 18:45.890
that cops are
when somebody gets shot

18:45.892 --> 18:47.592
or pilots when there's a crash.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.128
Yeah, and that's
what bothers me.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.530
Listen, say I'm out with Maggie.

18:52.532 --> 18:56.134
We're having dinner;
I have a few pops, okay?

18:56.136 --> 18:57.852
Mm-hmm. Go on.

18:57.853 --> 18:59.569
I look out the window;
I see someone getting mugged.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.572
I run out,
pull my service revolver

19:01.574 --> 19:03.441
out of my sock,
I yell, "halt!"

19:03.443 --> 19:05.176
Now, one of the muggers

19:05.178 --> 19:08.279
reaches into his pocket,
takes something out,

19:08.281 --> 19:09.680
turns around...

19:09.682 --> 19:11.549
I blow him away.

19:11.551 --> 19:14.252
Yeah, but the something
ain't a weapon.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.854
It's the victim's wallet.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.223
It is still
a totally righteous shoot.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.258
You know that.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.210
I know that.

19:22.211 --> 19:24.161
Internal Affairs smells
liquor on my breath--

19:24.164 --> 19:25.897
they crucify me.

19:28.234 --> 19:32.937
I got to tell you this,
that's how this feels to me.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.672
Well, you know,
there's a difference

19:34.674 --> 19:37.675
between a few pops and a bourbon
every five minutes.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.577
Come on,
the kid's exaggerating.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.679
Maybe he wasn't.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.183
No one said Auster
looked or acted drunk.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.451
They smelled it on his breath.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.324
Now, you know looking
and acting drunk

19:53.326 --> 19:55.526
don't mean squat.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.662
What are you guys talking about?

20:00.600 --> 20:03.968
Uh, back when Max and I
were partners,

20:03.970 --> 20:07.338
I had a little bit
of a drinking problem.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.207
So, finally,

20:09.209 --> 20:13.211
he told me that he wouldn't
partner with me

20:13.213 --> 20:14.946
unless I went to A.A.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.634
And?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.986
And I told him to mind
his own freaking business!

20:21.988 --> 20:23.621
I was under control.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.756
I knew what I was doing.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.359
I was just a social drinker.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.328
He made me so damn mad,

20:30.330 --> 20:34.232
I went out and I had
a few social drinks.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.268
Couple of hours later,

20:37.270 --> 20:40.771
I was standing in the middle
of Lexington Avenue,

20:40.773 --> 20:42.974
not looking or acting drunk,

20:42.976 --> 20:46.510
but I had my gun pointed
at a taxi driver

20:46.512 --> 20:49.313
because I didn't like the way
he was honking his horn.

20:52.518 --> 20:56.654
That night, I went
to my first meeting,

20:56.656 --> 20:59.724
and I been sober ever since.

21:07.734 --> 21:13.337
So, get back to the hospital
and twist a few people, huh?

21:13.339 --> 21:17.441
I'm begging you,
don't make me torpedo my career.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.577
We need
a second witness.

21:19.579 --> 21:20.811
Hmm?

21:20.813 --> 21:23.080
Look...

21:23.081 --> 21:25.348
Auster forgets more
every week than I know.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.451
I came to New York
because of him.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.453
Do you know what it means

21:29.455 --> 21:33.624
to be able to say I studied
under Dr. Edward Auster?

21:35.762 --> 21:39.563
He could destroy
the rest of my career.

21:39.565 --> 21:42.033
What career?

21:50.576 --> 21:52.343
He was drunk.

22:05.591 --> 22:08.359
The girl had muscle pains.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.594
The doctor ordered meperidine.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.464
The resident said something
about phenelzine.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.732
I didn't...

22:14.734 --> 22:16.834
I don't even
think he even heard.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.738
He took the meperidine,
and he injected it himself.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.406
No one tried
to stop him?

22:22.408 --> 22:24.041
What are we going to do?

22:24.043 --> 22:26.510
Wrestle Dr. Edward Auster
to the floor?

22:26.512 --> 22:28.646
I didn't even know he was wrong.

22:28.648 --> 22:32.083
You know now.

22:32.085 --> 22:33.451
Now we have to get approval

22:33.453 --> 22:35.753
from an executive
assistant D.A.?

22:35.755 --> 22:38.356
Stone's the boss.
What do you want me to do?

22:38.358 --> 22:40.391
This case is
politically sensitive.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.626
It gets tougher
all the time, Mike.

22:42.628 --> 22:46.130
The Davids kid already
made the term once.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.766
He said flat out,
Auster was drunk.

22:48.768 --> 22:53.404
D.A.:
I want to go in with more
than a nervous resident.

22:53.406 --> 22:58.142
The bartender says Auster
drank like a fish at the party.

22:58.144 --> 23:02.380
If the resident testifies,
there's a good chance,

23:02.382 --> 23:06.417
we get the rest
of the E.R. team to follow suit.

23:06.419 --> 23:09.553
Pick him up.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.156
Dr. Dematthews to C.C.U.
WOMAN (<i> over P.A.</i> ):

23:12.158 --> 23:14.792
Dr. Dematthews to C.C.U. please.

23:14.794 --> 23:18.429
We did a procedure
called balloon angioplasty.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.565
WOMAN:
Oh, but the pain?

23:21.567 --> 23:23.801
I don't think
it will come back.

23:23.803 --> 23:27.438
Look, I'm not saying
you can take up racquetball,

23:27.440 --> 23:29.807
but you will be able to walk,
climb stairs, and swim.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.442
Oh, thank you.

23:31.444 --> 23:35.513
Guess we won't
need our guns.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.148
Edward Auster?

23:40.520 --> 23:42.920
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.562
Practicing medicine drunk--
it's not prosecuted much.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.131
First in his class
at Harvard Medical School.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.733
Residency and fellowship
at Mass General.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.169
Say hello
to Philip Nevins--

23:58.171 --> 23:59.703
Dr. Auster's attorney.

23:59.705 --> 24:00.938
Author of the classic

24:00.940 --> 24:02.573
textbook on cardiology.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.141
Winner of the Lasker
Award for medical research.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.610
Published
175 journal articles.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.279
Does he walk on water?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.947
The trash that you people
usually prosecute

24:09.949 --> 24:11.816
can't murder fast enough

24:11.818 --> 24:14.552
to kill as many people
as Edward Auster has saved.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.954
Now I'm just trying to save you
from a mistaken perspective.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.957
Failing to perceive a
substantial and unjustified risk

24:19.959 --> 24:22.827
that might cause
Suzanne Morton's death--

24:22.829 --> 24:24.995
criminally negligent homicide.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.464
Consciously disregarding

24:26.465 --> 24:27.932
that substantial,
unjustified risk--

24:27.934 --> 24:29.600
manslaughter two.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.507
See you in court, Stone.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.810
Nevins is gonna flood
the witness stand

24:39.812 --> 24:42.947
with famous doctors
swearing that
Auster's a cross

24:42.949 --> 24:45.249
between Albert Schweitzer
and Albert Einstein.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.817
And we've got a father

24:46.819 --> 24:48.953
who was a medic
25 years ago?

24:48.955 --> 24:49.954
Morton took on heavy odds.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.822
Maybe we can
even them out.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.957
I want you

24:52.959 --> 24:55.593
to interview people
who know Auster.

24:55.595 --> 24:59.630
So, you're the dipstick
who's prosecuting Bud Auster.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.900
Is that what you call Dr. Auster
around the fishing hole?

25:02.902 --> 25:06.036
It's what I've called him
since the second grade.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.572
Some people do things

25:08.574 --> 25:10.207
and others...

25:10.209 --> 25:11.909
What do you and Auster do?

25:11.911 --> 25:14.578
We catch trout in Maine.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.779
Last time was in June.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.848
We sleep in the woods.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.917
Tell each other we're
just as young as we used to be.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.652
And drink?

25:21.654 --> 25:24.255
Somebody pass a law
against drunk fishing?

25:28.728 --> 25:30.728
I first admired America

25:30.730 --> 25:33.597
when I saw
<i> Judgment at Nuremberg.</i>

25:33.599 --> 25:36.300
Everybody pays for their crimes.

25:36.302 --> 25:40.004
I never thought
it would be me.

25:40.006 --> 25:45.276
There will be no prosecution
if you testify against Auster.

25:46.279 --> 25:48.746
And no job.

25:48.748 --> 25:52.683
I get to love America
and leave it.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.021
Two or three times each month
he calls and says he's coming.

25:57.023 --> 26:00.691
He's always late
because he's drunk.

26:00.693 --> 26:04.094
Do you know
what they call those rounds?

26:04.096 --> 26:06.797
Liver rounds.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.332
Everyone knew.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.302
Suzanne Morton
did have pneumonia.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.771
Dr. Auster did
tell you to lie.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.876
I have flexible hours
in my training.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.745
Do you know
how important that is

26:21.747 --> 26:24.315
when you're raising a child?

26:24.317 --> 26:26.317
That's non-responsive, doctor.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.586
Auster didn't act drunk.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.287
He never acted drunk.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.623
But he was drunk,
wasn't he?

26:32.625 --> 26:34.858
He was always drunk
on liver rounds.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.361
Wasn't he?

26:39.699 --> 26:41.966
And he did tell you to lie,

26:41.968 --> 26:44.101
didn't he?

26:49.709 --> 26:51.909
That poor girl.

26:51.911 --> 26:57.114
All she needed was some aspirin
and an antibiotic.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.352
Am I going to lose my license?

27:03.723 --> 27:06.123
That's not my decision, Doctor.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.058
However, I will give you

27:08.060 --> 27:10.928
immunity from prosecution
for conspiracy

27:10.930 --> 27:12.262
if you testify.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.935
You suspect. You know.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.670
What are you going to do?

27:19.672 --> 27:21.805
Contact the medical society?

27:21.807 --> 27:25.643
Sure. Intern Steven Simonson
wishes to file a complaint

27:25.645 --> 27:28.679
against the leading cardiologist
in the United States?

27:29.682 --> 27:32.383
Look, I admitted Suzanne Morton.

27:32.385 --> 27:35.185
It looks like
I blew the diagnosis.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.755
Is that what's
bothering you?

27:44.930 --> 27:47.665
Six months ago,
I get this guy.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.932
He's 25 years old.

27:48.934 --> 27:50.934
He's basically healthy, right?

27:50.936 --> 27:52.069
He walks in

27:52.071 --> 27:54.204
with the worst headache
in his life.

27:54.206 --> 27:57.207
His neck is sore,
but that's ambiguous.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.009
And Auster showed up?

27:59.011 --> 28:01.011
He prescribes meperidine
for the headache,

28:01.013 --> 28:02.880
without a patient workup.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.882
It's the worst thing
he can do.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.117
It masks the symptoms
of meningitis,

28:07.119 --> 28:08.719
which is what the guy had.

28:08.721 --> 28:11.422
We saved him...
barely.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.924
Now every time I see Auster
walk into the E.R.,

28:13.926 --> 28:16.160
I want to grab
whoever I'm treating

28:16.162 --> 28:18.162
and hide him in a closet.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.863
(<i> door opening</i> )

28:25.171 --> 28:28.005
Good afternoon, Dr. Simonson.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.174
Sir.

28:30.176 --> 28:33.444
That will be all,
thank you.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.815
So, are we early?

28:37.817 --> 28:41.218
from Dr. Simonson.
We got what we needed

28:41.220 --> 28:44.088
An intern, Mr. Stone.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.824
Are you planning on
asking the cleaning lady

28:46.826 --> 28:48.125
to testify, too?

28:48.127 --> 28:49.827
About the time
I threw the tissue

28:49.829 --> 28:52.096
into the waste paper
basket and missed?

28:52.098 --> 28:53.097
Ed, please.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.966
Every doctor
in this country

28:55.968 --> 28:58.235
has to worry about
some shyster lawyer

28:58.237 --> 29:00.003
suing for malpractice.

29:00.005 --> 29:04.141
Now we've got a prosecutor
looking over our shoulder.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.877
The next time
I write a prescription,

29:06.879 --> 29:09.813
am I supposed
to ask the Supreme Court

29:09.815 --> 29:11.181
to vote on the dosage?

29:11.183 --> 29:13.951
Look, Stone, you haven't got
a chance to convict.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.753
But this trial alone
can stain

29:15.755 --> 29:17.221
Dr. Auster's reputation.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.523
Are you proposing we give him
the Nobel Peace Prize

29:19.525 --> 29:20.891
and call it even?

29:20.893 --> 29:23.026
No. Adjournment with
an eye toward dismissal.

29:23.028 --> 29:27.030
Because of Dr. Auster,
a young woman is dead.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.199
A doctor, Mr. Stone,
is not a magician.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.768
drove drunk,
If you

29:30.770 --> 29:33.137
this would be
an open-and-shut case.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.973
When you practice medicine,
Mr. Stone,

29:35.975 --> 29:38.041
sometimes a patient dies.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.977
And when you're
a lawyer, Dr. Austin,

29:39.979 --> 29:43.847
some of the people
you prosecute are convicted.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.985
Defendant's Index, 1983.

29:47.987 --> 29:51.855
Where are computers
when you need them?

29:51.857 --> 29:53.257
Here's a little job for you.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.226
Keyboard every lawsuit
ever filed in New York County

29:56.228 --> 29:57.795
into a computer.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.531
Most malpractice
doesn't result in lawsuits.

30:00.533 --> 30:02.266
You got any better ideas?

30:02.268 --> 30:03.901
Go door to door?

30:03.902 --> 30:05.535
Ask if anybody saw
Auster kill the person?

30:05.538 --> 30:07.871
We're going
to do that next.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.073
Oh...

30:10.075 --> 30:13.076
I just saved us
a lot of shoe leather.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.945
<i> "Stivic versus Auster.</i>

30:14.947 --> 30:19.283
In re: The death
of Angela Stivic, age 11."

30:19.985 --> 30:21.585
When Dr. Auster's attorney

30:21.587 --> 30:24.321
told us they'd offer us
a settlement,

30:24.323 --> 30:26.323
my husband said, "Take it.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.825
"It will be over.

30:27.827 --> 30:30.594
"We can stop
thinking about Angela

30:30.596 --> 30:32.196
all the time."

30:34.033 --> 30:39.036
We bought the apartment
and the furniture.

30:39.038 --> 30:42.339
My husband
sat in the recliner once.

30:46.612 --> 30:47.978
I'm sorry.

30:50.583 --> 30:54.618
When Dr. Auster
came out of Angela's room

30:54.620 --> 30:58.055
to say
they couldn't stop the bleeding,

30:58.057 --> 31:01.158
I smelled liquor on his breath.

31:03.128 --> 31:05.095
Bourbon.

31:06.932 --> 31:09.933
All I wanted
was for Dr. Auster to say,

31:09.935 --> 31:11.935
"I killed Angela Stivic--

31:11.937 --> 31:16.139
the beautiful daughter
of George and Melanie Stivic."

31:18.644 --> 31:20.310
Excuse me.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.214
You know the difference

31:24.216 --> 31:27.284
between Auster
and a serial killer?

31:29.355 --> 31:31.889
The weapon.

31:39.164 --> 31:42.032
You objected to
administering meperidine?

31:42.034 --> 31:44.301
I suggested
acetaminophen,

31:44.303 --> 31:45.969
but Dr.Auster grew angry.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.337
He said if I didn't like

31:47.339 --> 31:49.139
the way the hospital
was being run,

31:49.141 --> 31:51.441
that I should continue
to do my training elsewhere.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.211
Thank you, doctor.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.179
Do you know how long Dr. Auster

31:56.181 --> 31:59.016
has been practicing medicine
Dr. Reesah?

31:59.018 --> 32:00.417
Raza.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.551
I don't know.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.387
25 years, maybe?

32:03.389 --> 32:06.990
And do you know
where he went to medical school?

32:06.992 --> 32:09.026
Harvard, I believe.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.527
That's correct.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.297
How long have you been
a doctor?

32:13.299 --> 32:14.998
Two years, sir.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.266
I see.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.969
Where did you go
to medical school?

32:18.971 --> 32:23.140
At the University
of Peshawar.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.342
Thank you.

32:27.346 --> 32:30.080
STONE:
Dr. Mills, were you
present on March 15,

32:30.082 --> 32:32.082
when Suzanne Morton
was admitted?

32:32.084 --> 32:33.984
Yes.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.485
And what was your reaction

32:35.487 --> 32:38.021
when Dr. Auster prepared
to inject Suzanne Morton

32:38.023 --> 32:40.223
with meperidine?

32:40.225 --> 32:44.995
I said her chart showed
she was taking phenelzine.

32:44.997 --> 32:48.031
Meperidine was contraindicated.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.500
And where do you go
to medical school?

32:50.502 --> 32:53.103
Harvard.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.205
Thank you.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.646
So, in your expert opinion,

33:02.648 --> 33:04.114
the administration of meperidine

33:04.116 --> 33:06.149
in conjunction with phenelzine

33:06.151 --> 33:08.118
killed Suzanne Morton?

33:08.120 --> 33:09.386
That's correct.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.154
No further questions.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.090
But isn't it true

33:13.092 --> 33:17.060
that you had to run
a second toxicological screen

33:17.062 --> 33:18.161
to even find meperidine

33:18.163 --> 33:21.164
and phenelzine in Suzanne
Morton's body?

33:21.166 --> 33:25.068
That's because both drugs
are unusual unto themselves...

33:25.070 --> 33:27.137
Thank you, Doctor.

33:27.139 --> 33:28.538
...and would not be found
unless specifically requested...

33:28.540 --> 33:29.573
Thank you, Doctor!

33:29.575 --> 33:31.408
...which they were.

33:31.410 --> 33:35.312
Isn't it possible that pneumonia
killed Suzanne Morton?

33:35.314 --> 33:39.282
It's<i> possible</i> that death rays
from Mars killed her...

33:39.284 --> 33:41.084
(<i> spectators laughing</i> )

33:41.086 --> 33:43.286
...but I don't think so.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.294
Dr. Auster must have
spoken to you

33:51.296 --> 33:52.462
during the course of the party.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.231
Every five minutes.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.599
"Fill 'er up."

33:55.601 --> 33:57.367
Was his speech slurred?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.169
Not so I remember.

33:59.171 --> 34:02.105
Did he seem drunk in any way?

34:02.107 --> 34:05.475
I never saw anyone
hold his liquor better.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.717
During your years of research

34:13.719 --> 34:15.585
into alcoholism, Dr. Walters,

34:15.587 --> 34:18.455
have you observed people
who appear to be sober

34:18.457 --> 34:20.457
but are in fact drunk?

34:20.459 --> 34:22.292
It happens all the time.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.194
It could happen to Dr. Auster?

34:24.196 --> 34:25.495
Objection.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.197
It could happen
to my Aunt Minnie,

34:27.199 --> 34:29.099
but it doesn't.
Sustained.

34:29.101 --> 34:33.136
I'll rephrase the question.

34:33.138 --> 34:40.744
If a 55-year-old man,
weighing 185 pounds,

34:40.746 --> 34:44.381
having consumed ten shots
of bourbon in two hours,

34:44.383 --> 34:48.118
appears to be
stone-cold sober,

34:48.120 --> 34:50.687
does that mean
he is in fact

34:50.689 --> 34:52.489
in full possession
of his faculties?

34:52.491 --> 34:54.424
No.

34:54.426 --> 34:58.395
Now, if that same 55-year-old,
man weighing 185 pounds

34:58.397 --> 35:04.601
has several drinks, and he
appears to be quite sober,

35:04.603 --> 35:06.636
but makes a mistake,

35:06.638 --> 35:08.572
would that mistake

35:08.573 --> 35:10.507
necessarily be caused
by his drinking

35:10.509 --> 35:12.776
or might he have made
that mistake anyway?

35:12.778 --> 35:15.779
Obviously,
that's impossible to say.

35:15.781 --> 35:19.716
You'd have to be
that 55-year-old man to know.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.295
We've got Auster drunk
at Suzanne Morton's bedside,

35:32.297 --> 35:33.663
prescribing the medicine
that killed her.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.533
Why do I feel like
we're on the ropes?

35:36.535 --> 35:38.702
We're going back over
every shred of evidence

35:38.704 --> 35:40.470
and find out what we missed.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.239
Just because
Auster's brilliant

35:42.241 --> 35:44.574
doesn't mean he didn't do
something dumb.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.610
And, cheer up,
we got all weekend.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.416
Over the past five years,

35:53.418 --> 35:55.418
the state health department
has been notified

35:55.420 --> 35:57.354
of six adverse occurrences

35:57.356 --> 35:58.622
in the Urban Medical Center
emergency room.

35:58.624 --> 36:01.758
"Adverse occurrences."
Nice phrase.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.760
They were people who died

36:03.762 --> 36:05.762
for reasons
not immediately clear.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.764
In all six cases,
no fault was found.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.299
Five of the cases
happened on nights

36:09.301 --> 36:12.369
Dr. Auster happened to be
in the emergency room.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.770
Interesting.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.405
Not evidence.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.674
Suzanne Morton,
Angela Stivic,

36:17.676 --> 36:20.377
a 25-year-old guy
with meningitis.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.379
Now statistical anomalies.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.581
This is beyond
coincidence.

36:24.583 --> 36:25.782
In the case
of the Morton girl,

36:25.784 --> 36:28.852
you cannot prove
that he crossed the line

36:28.854 --> 36:33.456
between criminal recklessness
and unfortunate mistake.

36:33.458 --> 36:36.459
If he knew he was an alcoholic,

36:36.461 --> 36:40.864
then drinking before work
was criminally reckless.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.333
The crime
did not take place

36:43.335 --> 36:45.268
in the emergency room.

36:45.270 --> 36:48.238
It took place
at the cocktail party.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.740
Excellent.

36:50.742 --> 36:54.578
Okay, okay, I'm an alcoholic,
and I know I'm an alcoholic.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.780
What do I do, buy liquor?

36:56.782 --> 37:00.483
We've got charge receipts
for enough bourbon to prove...

37:00.485 --> 37:01.785
It proves he drank.

37:01.787 --> 37:04.788
It doesn't prove
he knew he was a drunk.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.823
Go to A.A. meetings?

37:06.825 --> 37:10.293
We can't canvas hundreds of A.A.
meetings for tomorrow afternoon,

37:10.295 --> 37:12.395
and there are no A.A. meetings

37:12.397 --> 37:14.264
in his calendar.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.565
Whoa.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.802
What?

37:18.804 --> 37:20.804
Whenever he left town,

37:20.806 --> 37:24.274
he called the office
every day, collect...

37:24.276 --> 37:26.910
except on
his last fishing trip.

37:26.912 --> 37:30.814
STONE:
Where did you spend the week
of June 10, Mr. Hoffman?

37:30.816 --> 37:32.882
In Maine, fishing.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.318
Was Edward Auster with you?

37:45.397 --> 37:48.365
Was Edward Auster with you?

37:49.935 --> 37:52.502
No.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.905
Did he ask you to tell people
that he had been

37:55.907 --> 37:58.541
with you on that trip?

37:58.543 --> 37:59.809
Yes.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.878
Why was that, Mr. Hoffman?

38:01.880 --> 38:05.749
He didn't want anyone to know
where he was.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.718
Why was that?

38:10.822 --> 38:12.922
He was embarrassed.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.658
And why was that?

38:16.561 --> 38:19.562
He checked himself
into a clinic.

38:19.564 --> 38:20.964
What clinic?

38:20.966 --> 38:22.866
The Colson Clinic.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.869
What kind of clinic

38:25.871 --> 38:29.339
is the Colson Clinic?

38:29.341 --> 38:31.441
Mr. Hoffman?

38:31.443 --> 38:34.344
It's a substance abuse clinic.

38:34.346 --> 38:35.979
Thank you.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.558
In his first group sessions at
the clinic, Dr. Auster told us

38:48.560 --> 38:51.428
he had gone through college
in three years,

38:51.430 --> 38:53.863
and he became
chief of medicine

38:53.865 --> 38:56.599
at a major New York hospital
in only ten years.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.468
STONE:
Anything else?

38:58.470 --> 39:01.771
I believe
he also mentioned

39:01.773 --> 39:03.873
that he skipped
fifth grade.

39:03.875 --> 39:07.377
Dr. Auster had
very little patience

39:07.379 --> 39:09.379
with our program.

39:09.381 --> 39:12.749
How long does
your treatment program last?

39:12.751 --> 39:14.384
28 days.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.753
How long did
Dr. Auster stay?

39:16.755 --> 39:18.621
Six days, he left
against our advice..

39:18.623 --> 39:20.023
STONE:
Would you say

39:20.025 --> 39:22.459
that Dr. Auster knew
he was an alcoholic

39:22.461 --> 39:24.394
by the time he left?

39:24.396 --> 39:27.897
He would never have come in
the first place if he hadn't.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.033
I have no further questions.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.435
Are you positive?

39:36.007 --> 39:38.775
Now I am going to ask you
to limit your responses

39:38.777 --> 39:40.977
to a simple "yes" or "no,"

39:40.979 --> 39:44.581
so we can avoid the subjective
flights of fantasy

39:44.583 --> 39:47.584
that your last statement
exemplified.

39:47.586 --> 39:50.520
Do you understand my request,
Dr. Rasmussen?

39:50.522 --> 39:51.921
Yes.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.057
Good. Thank you.

39:54.059 --> 39:59.996
Now, did Dr. Auster say to you,
"I am an alcoholic"?

39:59.998 --> 40:02.065
No.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.435
In fact,
didn't Dr. Auster say to you

40:05.437 --> 40:07.704
"I am not an alcoholic"?

40:07.706 --> 40:09.539
You must...

40:09.541 --> 40:12.442
Yes or no, Dr. Rasmussen,
please.

40:12.444 --> 40:15.612
Did he say
"I am not an alcoholic"?

40:20.485 --> 40:22.485
Yes.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.524
No more questions.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.893
JUDGE:
You may step down, Doctor.

40:29.895 --> 40:33.630
STONE:
Did Dr. Auster
discuss his drinking with you?

40:33.632 --> 40:37.567
Anything that transpired
between Dr. Auster and myself

40:37.569 --> 40:40.570
is protected
by patient-doctor privilege.

40:40.572 --> 40:44.007
But as well as patient
and doctor, you're friends?

40:44.009 --> 40:45.542
We are.

40:45.544 --> 40:48.645
Where did you have lunch
with him on June 7th?

40:48.647 --> 40:50.046
In your office?

40:50.048 --> 40:51.781
No.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.750
At the Four Seasons.

40:53.752 --> 40:57.053
Did you conduct your physical
examination of Dr. Auster there?

40:57.055 --> 40:59.722
Uh, no.

40:59.724 --> 41:03.927
Did you bill him for your time?

41:05.564 --> 41:07.063
No, it was a, uh...

41:07.065 --> 41:09.065
A friendly lunch.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.000
Yes.

41:11.002 --> 41:13.670
So, privilege is not

41:13.672 --> 41:15.605
an issue here.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.006
Did you say

41:17.008 --> 41:20.076
anything during
your friendly lunch

41:20.078 --> 41:22.612
that upset him?

41:22.614 --> 41:24.047
Doctor?

41:25.851 --> 41:27.851
I... I...

41:27.853 --> 41:30.053
I told him that, uh...

41:30.055 --> 41:36.559
if he didn't stop drinking,
he'd be dead in five years.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.802
Thank you.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.137
Does the defense wish to begin
or do you prefer to break

41:48.139 --> 41:50.907
for an early lunch, Mr. Nevis?

41:50.909 --> 41:52.726
If it please the court,

41:52.727 --> 41:54.544
the defense can bring its one
witness before noon.

41:54.546 --> 41:55.912
Proceed.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.814
The defense calls

41:57.816 --> 41:59.949
Dr. Edward Auster.

42:03.788 --> 42:08.057
...and so the tragic death
of a six-year-old

42:08.059 --> 42:13.563
led to sight for one child
and a new heart for another.

42:13.565 --> 42:16.165
The boy who got the heart,
is now the star shortstop

42:16.167 --> 42:18.801
for a little league
baseball team.

42:18.803 --> 42:22.038
NEVINS:
And finally, how many doctors
and immediately family members

42:22.040 --> 42:25.141
have you treated
in the past ten years?

42:26.978 --> 42:30.046
I... I really have no idea.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.081
Well, I do.
I did some research.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.350
Over 300.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.618
So it seems that you're
the kind of doctor whose hands

42:36.621 --> 42:39.155
other doctors
put their lives in.

42:39.157 --> 42:43.126
I certainly hope
I've lived up to that trust.

42:43.128 --> 42:45.094
Oh, brother.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.030
The defense rests, Your Honor.

42:47.032 --> 42:50.600
Mr. Stone, the hour's almost up.

42:50.602 --> 42:51.935
Could you hold your
cross-examination

42:51.937 --> 42:53.603
until after lunch?

42:53.605 --> 42:54.971
Of course, Your Honor.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.172
(<i> gavel pounding )</i>

42:57.108 --> 42:58.641
Good job.

42:58.643 --> 42:59.976
Thanks a million.

43:08.653 --> 43:10.987
(<i> whispering</i> )

43:14.192 --> 43:16.726
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

43:43.021 --> 43:45.221
(<i> whispering</i> )

43:47.292 --> 43:49.225
That many?

43:50.295 --> 43:52.795
So then you do think
patients should know

43:52.797 --> 43:55.098
as much as possible
about the doctors
that treat them?

43:55.100 --> 43:58.034
Yes, of course, where he was
trained and who trained him.

43:58.036 --> 43:59.802
Personal habits?

43:59.804 --> 44:02.205
I don't see why.

44:02.207 --> 44:07.110
Unless it impacts upon
his ability as a physician.

44:07.112 --> 44:10.013
Well, let's talk
about that.

44:13.952 --> 44:16.319
Have you had
a drink today?

44:16.321 --> 44:18.955
Objection, Your Honor,
relevancy.

44:18.957 --> 44:21.024
I'll allow it.

44:23.228 --> 44:25.161
Yes.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.864
More than one?

44:30.235 --> 44:32.101
Yes.

44:33.938 --> 44:36.072
How many more than one?

44:41.079 --> 44:43.046
I'm not sure.

44:43.048 --> 44:47.316
Do you recall, was it
between two and five drinks?

44:47.318 --> 44:50.186
I don't recall.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.088
Doctor, is it not a fact

44:52.090 --> 44:55.224
that you had six bourbons
on the rocks

44:55.226 --> 44:58.861
at Chances Pub
not 45 minutes ago?

44:58.863 --> 45:00.797
Objection, Your Honor.

45:00.799 --> 45:02.031
JUDGE:
I'll allow it.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.232
Let's move on, Mr. Stone.

45:03.234 --> 45:05.301
the well, Doctor Auster?
Would you step into

45:05.303 --> 45:08.971
no need for Dr. Auster to stand.
Objection, Your Honor, there's

45:08.973 --> 45:11.974
Side-bar, please,
Your Honor.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.914
What's going on, Mr. Stone?

45:17.916 --> 45:19.348
Does Dr. Auster look
drunk to you, Your Honor?

45:19.350 --> 45:20.983
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

45:20.985 --> 45:22.251
I must be allowed to show

45:22.253 --> 45:24.153
Dr. Auster is in the courtroom
and he's drunk.

45:24.155 --> 45:26.089
Your Honor,
I strenuously
object to this.

45:26.091 --> 45:27.290
Overruled.

45:27.292 --> 45:29.258
Proceed, Mr. Stone.

45:29.260 --> 45:33.062
Step into the well,
Doctor.

45:38.002 --> 45:40.236
This is the New York City
Police Department Manual.

45:40.238 --> 45:44.874
I'm going to administer
a standard test

45:44.876 --> 45:48.344
to determine whether a person
is operating a motor vehicle

45:48.346 --> 45:50.279
under the influence.

45:50.281 --> 45:52.882
This is an outrage.

45:52.884 --> 45:55.351
Do as Mr. Stone instructs you,
Doctor.

45:58.156 --> 46:02.024
Raise your arm
to the level of your shoulder,

46:02.026 --> 46:04.327
close your eyes,

46:04.329 --> 46:09.365
