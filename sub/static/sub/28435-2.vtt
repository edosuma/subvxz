00:02.000 --> 00:06.998
# Yeah, not going out
Not staying in

00:06.999 --> 00:09.998
# Just hanging around with my head
in a spin

00:09.999 --> 00:12.998
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:12.999 --> 00:15.998
# We're not going out

00:15.999 --> 00:18.934
# We are not going out! #

00:25.999 --> 00:30.132
<font color="#FFFF00"> Aw. See?
What did I say? It's lovely.</font>

00:30.133 --> 00:32.998
Give it a chance.
Anna and Toby aren't here yet.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.998
Are you sure this was
such a good idea?

00:35.999 --> 00:37.533
<font color="#FFFF00"> What's not to like?</font>

00:37.534 --> 00:40.998
<font color="#FFFF00"> The New Forest, no kids,
just us and our friends.</font>

00:40.999 --> 00:43.998
Exactly, friends.
Let's keep it that way.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.998
<font color="#FFFF00"> What do you mean? </font>It's one thing
sharing a coffee,

00:45.999 --> 00:47.998
it's a different thing
going to a holiday cottage

00:47.999 --> 00:50.998
for the whole weekend. They'll spend
the whole time bickering.

00:50.999 --> 00:53.933
<font color="#FFFF00"> They might not. The change of scene
might mellow them.</font>

00:53.934 --> 00:54.998
Yeah, that's right.

00:54.999 --> 00:57.399
Send them off into the middle
of a forest and suddenly

00:57.400 --> 00:59.998
it'll be like...
What's that romantic comedy called?

00:59.999 --> 01:00.999
Deliverance.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.999
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hi, Anna!</font>

01:06.079 --> 01:07.543
<font color="#FFFF00"> Got you.</font>

01:07.544 --> 01:10.543
I knew she wasn't there,
the temperature hadn't dropped.

01:10.544 --> 01:13.079
<font color="#FFFF00"> Let's have a look at the bedrooms.</font>

01:15.812 --> 01:18.543
It's not exactly like the website,
is it?

01:18.544 --> 01:21.543
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, there's a good view of...</font>

01:21.544 --> 01:23.543
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..the car parking spaces.</font>

01:23.544 --> 01:25.543
<font color="#FFFF00"> That might come in handy, actually.</font>
Why?</font>

01:25.544 --> 01:27.544
In case we decide to attach
a hose to the exhaust pipe

01:27.545 --> 01:29.543
and asphyxiate ourselves.

01:29.544 --> 01:31.302
<font color="#FFFF00"> Maybe we should unpack?</font>

01:31.304 --> 01:33.303
What, and then jump in the suitcase
and sleep in there?

01:33.304 --> 01:35.105
There'll be more room.

01:35.106 --> 01:38.304
Come on, let's have a look at
the upstairs bedroom.

01:39.972 --> 01:42.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Erm, heavy suitcase?</font>

01:42.304 --> 01:44.239
Yeah, bring that.

01:48.304 --> 01:50.303
Oh, this is more like it.

01:50.304 --> 01:53.303
They obviously only took
photos of the better one.

01:53.304 --> 01:56.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Same reason you're hardly
in our wedding album.</font>

01:57.304 --> 01:59.303
Oh, and it's got a Nespresso!

01:59.304 --> 02:01.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's only a coffee machine.</font>

02:01.304 --> 02:03.304
Oh, why does Clooney bother?

02:05.304 --> 02:06.704
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, this is awkward.</font>

02:06.705 --> 02:09.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> What is?</font>
Deciding who gets this room.</font>

02:09.304 --> 02:12.571
Don't be silly,
I'll let you share it with me.

02:12.572 --> 02:14.571
There's nothing to decide.
It's ours.

02:14.572 --> 02:17.303
First come, first served -
it's an unwritten rule.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> We can't just claim it.</font>

02:18.839 --> 02:20.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> Anna and I booked this together.</font>

02:20.572 --> 02:23.437
<font color="#FFFF00"> The unwritten rule is
that they have to offer it to us.</font>

02:23.438 --> 02:25.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> We have to wait until they arrive.</font>

02:25.304 --> 02:27.303
We should at least
mark our territory.

02:27.304 --> 02:30.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> If you do that,
I'm sleeping in the car.</font>

02:30.304 --> 02:32.437
Just something small,
a little sign that establishes

02:32.438 --> 02:34.303
that is our room.

02:34.304 --> 02:35.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Like what?</font>

02:35.305 --> 02:37.303
Unpack.

02:37.304 --> 02:39.238
<font color="#FFFF00"> Unpack?</font>

02:39.239 --> 02:42.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why don't we just both strip off
and get in the bath?</font>

02:44.304 --> 02:46.238
<font color="#FFFF00"> That's not an actual suggestion.</font>

02:46.239 --> 02:47.303
Well, what, then?

02:47.304 --> 02:50.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> We could leave our bags
in here. How's that?</font>

02:50.304 --> 02:52.303
OK.

02:52.304 --> 02:54.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Not on the bed!</font>

02:54.304 --> 02:56.305
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's too obvious. Next to the bed.</font>

02:59.304 --> 03:01.705
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, it's too close. Put them...</font>

03:09.304 --> 03:11.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..there.</font>

03:11.304 --> 03:13.105
<font color="#FFFF00"> Perfect.</font>

03:13.106 --> 03:14.437
<font color="#FFFF00"> That sends exactly
the right message.</font>

03:14.438 --> 03:16.303
Yeah, if that message is,

03:16.304 --> 03:18.839
I'm a passive-aggressive
psychopath.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.572 --> 03:42.105
It's got to be first come,
first served.

03:42.106 --> 03:44.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can we talk about something else?</font>

03:44.304 --> 03:46.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> What do you want to do this weekend?</font>

03:46.304 --> 03:49.238
I don't know, I don't mind.
What are the options?

03:49.239 --> 03:51.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's a craft museum
where you can try your hand</font>

03:51.304 --> 03:53.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> at traditional lace-making.</font>

03:53.304 --> 03:56.303
Ooh, I'm not as young as I used
to be. Think of me heart.

03:56.304 --> 04:00.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Or there's the ruins
of an Anglo-Saxon monastery.</font>

04:05.304 --> 04:08.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Or Jungle Jeremy's Crazy-Fun Zoo.</font>

04:08.304 --> 04:10.303
Mmm!

04:10.304 --> 04:11.304
Difficult decision.

04:11.305 --> 04:13.303
Ruins, fun?

04:13.304 --> 04:14.304
Ruins, fun?

04:14.305 --> 04:16.303
Talk of the devil.

04:18.303 --> 04:21.303
So, you finally got here.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> We'd have been here a lot sooner
if Toby didn't drive so slowly.</font>

04:24.304 --> 04:27.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, it's hard to build up enough
speed when your wife's</font>

04:27.304 --> 04:30.303
<font color="#11FF11"> packed so much.
Four cases for a single weekend.</font>

04:30.304 --> 04:34.106
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hmm, a single weekend
would be a lovely idea.</font>

04:35.304 --> 04:38.303
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm only joking. I actually find
it strangely soothing</font>

04:38.304 --> 04:40.239
<font color="#11FF11"> watching you pack your bags.</font>

04:42.106 --> 04:44.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sorry, awful journey.</font>

04:44.304 --> 04:47.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Let's unpack.
What are the bedrooms like?</font>

04:47.304 --> 04:50.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, well, we haven't really
looked yet, have we, Lee?</font>

04:50.304 --> 04:53.303
No, just slung our bags
in the first bedroom we came to.

04:53.304 --> 04:56.238
<font color="#11FF11"> What, that one over there?</font>
Erm, no.

04:56.239 --> 04:57.437
It was the one upstairs, actually.

04:57.438 --> 05:00.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> The first bedroom
you came to was upstairs?</font>

05:00.304 --> 05:03.303
Well, always start at the top
of the house and work your way down.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.105
I learned that from...

05:05.106 --> 05:06.304
..Father Christmas.

05:07.839 --> 05:11.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, nothing's been decided.
Have a look around.</font>

05:20.304 --> 05:22.105
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, this is nice.</font>

05:22.106 --> 05:24.303
<font color="#00FFFF">I see you've started settling in.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, no.</font>

05:24.304 --> 05:27.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> Like we say,
we just dumped the bags in here.</font>

05:27.839 --> 05:30.303
<font color="#11FF11"> You've already had a bit
of a lie down, I see?</font>

05:30.304 --> 05:32.105
Just five minutes.

05:32.106 --> 05:34.105
You know what it's like
after a long drive -

05:34.106 --> 05:36.304
I just like to slip
my shoes and pants off.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> He didn't do that.</font>

05:41.304 --> 05:43.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, this is a lovely room.</font>

05:43.304 --> 05:45.303
If you like that sort of thing.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.304
Which we do.

05:46.305 --> 05:50.304
OK, Anna, shall we check out
the other bedroom? <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#11FF11"> Mmm.</font>

05:59.972 --> 06:03.303
What are they doing? They should
have just offered us this room.

06:03.304 --> 06:05.303
Why are they checking
out the other one?

06:05.304 --> 06:06.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> They've probably gone to see</font>

06:06.305 --> 06:09.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> if you've been sleeping in that bed
too, Goldilocks.</font>

06:09.304 --> 06:11.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> I specifically told you
not to touch it.</font>

06:11.304 --> 06:13.437
Touch it? I'm beginning to wish
we'd had sex in it.

06:13.438 --> 06:16.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> They'll be back in a second,
this is your last chance.</font>

06:16.304 --> 06:18.303
Well, I'm up for it if you...

06:18.304 --> 06:20.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> Your last chance to start
behaving like an adult!</font>

06:20.972 --> 06:22.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> Don't make this awkward.</font>

06:22.572 --> 06:24.303
HE SIGHS

06:24.304 --> 06:26.106
FOOTSTEPS

06:29.304 --> 06:31.437
So, how is the other room?

06:31.438 --> 06:33.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> Uh, cosy.</font>

06:34.304 --> 06:37.238
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Right, so...?</font>
So, who's going to go where, then?</font>

06:37.239 --> 06:40.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, we really don't mind
either way, do we, Lee?</font>

06:40.304 --> 06:41.304
Well...

06:41.305 --> 06:44.303
<font color="#11FF11"> We don't mind either way either.</font>

06:44.304 --> 06:47.303
<font color="#11FF11"> I suppose we could always toss
a coin to decide who sleeps where?</font>

06:47.304 --> 06:50.304
Didn't think it was going
to be that sort of a weekend!

06:52.304 --> 06:54.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I really don't have a preference.</font>

06:54.304 --> 06:57.304
Me neither.
I'm happy with you or Toby.

07:00.304 --> 07:03.571
I guess, as nobody minds either
way...

07:03.572 --> 07:06.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Which we don't. </font>And neither do we.</font>

07:06.304 --> 07:09.704
..and given that our
suitcases are already...

07:09.705 --> 07:12.303
<font color="#11FF11"> There is just one thing.</font>

07:12.304 --> 07:14.303
What?

07:14.304 --> 07:16.238
<font color="#11FF11"> Anna's a very light sleeper.</font>

07:16.239 --> 07:18.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, now, Toby!</font>

07:18.304 --> 07:20.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I told you not to make
a fuss about this.</font>

07:20.304 --> 07:23.303
<font color="#11FF11"> You did. I'm sorry, darling.</font>

07:23.304 --> 07:26.238
<font color="#11FF11"> It's just with this
being the quieter room,</font>

07:26.239 --> 07:28.303
<font color="#11FF11"> with it being upstairs
and, I don't know,</font>

07:28.304 --> 07:32.303
<font color="#11FF11"> perhaps it makes more sense
if we take this one?</font>

07:32.304 --> 07:33.304
Hmm.

07:35.438 --> 07:37.437
<font color="#FFFF00"> Of course.</font>

07:37.438 --> 07:42.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Only if you're absolutely
110% sure you don't mind.</font>

07:42.304 --> 07:46.303
Not sure it's possible to be 110%
sure about anything...

07:46.304 --> 07:48.303
..and yet we are.

07:48.304 --> 07:50.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's settled, then.</font>

07:50.304 --> 07:53.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> Toby, help take
their bags downstairs.</font>

08:11.304 --> 08:12.838
Light sleeper?

08:12.839 --> 08:15.303
I thought the undead never slept.

08:15.304 --> 08:18.571
We should just stand her upright
in the larder.

08:18.572 --> 08:22.105
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, I'm just glad
you're taking this so well.</font>

08:22.106 --> 08:24.303
What, so they mean,
this is the noisy room?

08:24.304 --> 08:27.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Doesn't sound very noisy to me.</font>
It does to me.</font>

08:27.304 --> 08:29.303
I don't even care about the bedroom.

08:29.304 --> 08:31.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> I have to say, that is coming
across very strongly.</font>

08:31.304 --> 08:33.437
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's the principle.</font>
What principle?</font>

08:33.438 --> 08:36.303
The United Nations international
declaration on first dibs.

08:36.304 --> 08:39.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> And you know this
won't be the end of it. </font>Oh, good.</font>

08:39.304 --> 08:41.303
Now they know they can
trample all over us.

08:41.304 --> 08:44.303
By Sunday night, we'll be serving
them little cakes on doilies

08:44.304 --> 08:46.303
and answering to "garcon".

08:46.304 --> 08:49.303
And I bet you any amount of money
they try and leave first

08:49.304 --> 08:50.571
on the final day.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why would they do that?</font>

08:52.304 --> 08:53.971
It's the oldest trick in the book.

08:53.972 --> 08:56.303
Then we are lumbered
with the bulk of the tidying-up.

08:56.304 --> 08:58.105
People always try that one.

08:58.106 --> 09:00.303
My dad used to do it
to whole marriages.

09:00.304 --> 09:03.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Anna and Toby won't try
and leave first.</font>

09:03.304 --> 09:05.571
Trust me, they'll do it.

09:05.572 --> 09:07.437
Taking the bigger bedroom. Pfft!

09:07.438 --> 09:10.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Lee, I really think
you need to let this go.</font>

09:10.304 --> 09:11.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> Rise above it.</font>

09:11.972 --> 09:14.105
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's a story in the Bible
where Jesus says,</font>

09:14.106 --> 09:17.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> "If a man steals your coat,
then give him your shirt too."</font>

09:17.572 --> 09:20.303
Yeah, there's also story
in the Bible about how Jesus got

09:20.304 --> 09:22.571
kicked out of five-star
accommodation and had to sleep

09:22.572 --> 09:24.303
in a shed.

09:24.304 --> 09:26.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> We're going to show them
that we're not petty.</font>

09:26.304 --> 09:28.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> In fact, we're going
to go the opposite way</font>

09:28.304 --> 09:29.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> and be really lovely about it.</font>

09:29.972 --> 09:32.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> We're going to go in there and prove
that we're the better people</font>

09:32.304 --> 09:34.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> and offer to make them dinner.</font>

09:34.304 --> 09:36.971
So, let me get this right.
Not only are we sleeping below them

09:36.972 --> 09:39.571
in the rubbish accommodation,
we're now going to cook for them?

09:39.572 --> 09:41.572
What is this, Downton Abbey?

09:44.304 --> 09:47.105
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

09:47.106 --> 09:50.303
<font color="#11FF11"> In your pyjamas already?</font>
These aren't my pyjamas.

09:50.304 --> 09:52.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's OK if you want to wear
your bed things for dinner.</font>

09:52.304 --> 09:54.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> We wouldn't dream of
trying to stop you.</font>

09:54.304 --> 09:56.303
Good, because I sleep naked.

09:56.304 --> 10:00.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> This music's nice.
Where's it coming from?</font>

10:00.304 --> 10:02.303
<font color="#11FF11"> I connected my phone.</font>

10:02.304 --> 10:04.303
What to, the spirit world?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.704
<font color="#11FF11"> We have other music, if you prefer.</font>

10:06.705 --> 10:09.571
<font color="#11FF11"> Arias From The
Coloratura Repertoire.</font>

10:09.572 --> 10:12.438
WOMAN SINGS LIVELY ARIA

10:14.305 --> 10:16.303
If this is Barry White,

10:16.304 --> 10:18.303
I don't think it's playing
on the right speed.

10:18.304 --> 10:20.838
<font color="#11FF11"> Not a fan of the Italian classics,
then?</font>

10:20.839 --> 10:22.303
No, no, it's perfect.

10:22.304 --> 10:25.303
Goes really well with
the screaming in me head.

10:25.304 --> 10:27.303
MUSIC OFF

10:27.304 --> 10:30.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, what do people
want to do tomorrow?</font>

10:30.304 --> 10:32.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> The zoo. </font>We're open to anything.</font>

10:32.304 --> 10:33.304
The zoo.

10:33.305 --> 10:36.303
<font color="#11FF11"> I notice there's an Anglo-Saxon
monastery not far away.</font>

10:36.304 --> 10:38.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Could be interesting.</font>

10:40.304 --> 10:43.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Or the zoo sounds good too.
Doesn't it, Anna?</font>

10:43.304 --> 10:44.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hmm.</font>

10:44.305 --> 10:46.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, what's it going to be?</font>

10:46.304 --> 10:49.704
<font color="#FFFF00"> St Audoem's Monastery
or Jungle Jeremy's Cra...?</font>

10:49.705 --> 10:52.303
You don't need to say
the name of the zoo.

10:52.304 --> 10:55.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Why don't we head off
to the monastery in the morning,</font>

10:55.304 --> 10:58.303
<font color="#11FF11"> see how it goes, and take
the rest of the day from there?</font>

10:58.304 --> 10:59.571
But they're miles apart.

10:59.572 --> 11:00.971
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's settled, then.</font>

11:00.972 --> 11:02.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right, I'm famished.</font>

11:02.304 --> 11:03.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, good.</font>

11:03.305 --> 11:06.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Because I'm cooking
dinner for us all.</font>

11:06.304 --> 11:08.105
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh!</font>

11:08.106 --> 11:09.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> What a lovely gesture.</font>

11:09.304 --> 11:10.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> Spag bol.</font>

11:10.972 --> 11:12.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right.</font>

11:12.304 --> 11:13.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> But we can't let you do that.</font>

11:13.305 --> 11:16.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> You were lovely and gave us
the quieter room.</font>

11:16.304 --> 11:18.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, I insist.</font>

11:18.304 --> 11:19.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> I won't hear of it.</font>

11:19.305 --> 11:22.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're going to do all the cooking
for the whole weekend.</font>

11:22.304 --> 11:23.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> Don't be silly.</font>

11:23.572 --> 11:27.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> How about tonight I do
smoked salmon tartlets,</font>

11:27.304 --> 11:32.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> followed by sirloin steaks
and then a raspberry Pavlova?</font>

11:39.304 --> 11:41.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> Honestly, I'd be more then
happy to do my spag bol.</font>

11:41.839 --> 11:43.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Absolutely not.</font>

11:43.304 --> 11:44.704
<font color="#00FFFF"> Spag bol?</font>

11:44.705 --> 11:47.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> You're on holiday,
you're supposed to have a treat.</font>

11:47.304 --> 11:51.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> Come on, Toby, let's get the rest
of the food from the car.</font>

11:52.304 --> 11:53.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> The cheek!</font>

11:53.839 --> 11:57.437
<font color="#FFFF00"> Did you hear the way she said "spag
bol" like she was spitting it out?</font>

11:57.438 --> 11:59.238
Well, she's quite posh.

11:59.239 --> 12:01.303
She probably doesn't know
what spag bol is.

12:01.304 --> 12:05.303
Perhaps you should have added
the words "hetti" and "ognese".

12:05.304 --> 12:08.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Thanks for your support. </font>Well, you
didn't support me about the zoo.

12:08.304 --> 12:10.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> That's because I don't care
about the bloody zoo.</font>

12:10.572 --> 12:12.704
Oh, right, so you'd rather
go to the monastery?

12:12.705 --> 12:15.303
What kind of person wants
to spend their Sunday mornings

12:15.304 --> 12:16.304
in a church?

12:16.305 --> 12:19.303
Anyway, I thought
you were rising above it.

12:19.304 --> 12:22.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, I was until she started taking
control of the kitchen.</font>

12:22.305 --> 12:26.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> And it's the way she did it,
standing there with a big fake smile</font>

12:26.304 --> 12:27.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> on her face.</font>

12:27.305 --> 12:29.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> I can't stand it when
people are insincere,</font>

12:29.304 --> 12:31.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> acting like everything's fine
when...</font>

12:31.972 --> 12:34.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can I give you a hand with that,
Anna?</font>

12:34.304 --> 12:37.105
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, you sit yourselves down
and relax.</font>

12:37.106 --> 12:38.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why don't I make a salad?</font>

12:38.304 --> 12:43.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, Toby's on salad duty.
He has an affinity with wet lettuce.</font>

12:43.304 --> 12:45.705
<font color="#11FF11"> Whereas Anna is more iceberg.</font>

12:47.106 --> 12:49.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're being far too nice, Anna.</font>

12:49.304 --> 12:52.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> There must be something
Lee and I can do.</font>

12:52.304 --> 12:54.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, if you absolutely insist.</font>

12:54.304 --> 12:55.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> I do.</font>

12:55.305 --> 12:59.105
<font color="#00FFFF"> What would be really helpful,
and doing me an enormous favour,</font>

12:59.106 --> 13:01.572
<font color="#00FFFF"> would be if you could lay the table.</font>

13:04.304 --> 13:07.303
<font color="#00FFFF">If you're sure you don't mind?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> Course not.</font>

13:07.304 --> 13:10.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's times like this you miss
having the children around to help.</font>

13:10.304 --> 13:13.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Not that we're comparing
you to children, of course.</font>

13:13.304 --> 13:15.105
<font color="#00FFFF"> Of course not.</font>

13:15.106 --> 13:16.572
<font color="#00FFFF"> Lee, clothes on,
dinner won't be long.</font>

13:23.572 --> 13:25.303
Will you keep still?

13:25.304 --> 13:28.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> I would if I could find a sliver
of mattress that didn't feel</font>

13:28.572 --> 13:31.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> like a pincushion.</font>

13:31.304 --> 13:34.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm getting back ache.
And it stinks.</font>

13:35.304 --> 13:38.304
Is now a really bad time
to ask for sex?

13:39.304 --> 13:43.105
Told you this weekend
was a bad idea.

13:43.106 --> 13:45.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Only 36 hours to go.</font>

13:45.304 --> 13:47.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> They're intolerable.</font>

13:47.304 --> 13:51.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> The food, the music, your clothes -
they want to control everything.</font>

13:51.972 --> 13:53.304
What can we do?

13:57.304 --> 13:59.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> We play them at their own game.</font>

13:59.304 --> 14:02.105
<font color="#FFFF00"> We stop apologising
and we start taking control.</font>

14:02.106 --> 14:06.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> We make them do what we want to do,
and we don't take no for an answer.</font>

14:06.304 --> 14:08.303
Show them who's the daddy.

14:08.304 --> 14:09.704
<font color="#FFFF00"> We're the daddy.</font>

14:09.705 --> 14:12.304
And daddy's taking us
to the zoo tomorrow.

14:14.304 --> 14:17.239
That sounded better in my head.

14:23.304 --> 14:25.303
<font color="#11FF11"> ALL: </font>Morning!</font>

14:25.304 --> 14:26.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Sleep well? </font>Like a log.</font>

14:26.305 --> 14:29.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, we thought you were
a light sleeper, Anna?</font>

14:29.304 --> 14:31.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I slept like a light log.</font>

14:31.304 --> 14:32.572
<font color="#11FF11"> Like a twig.</font>

14:34.304 --> 14:36.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> Bacon sarnies, everyone?</font>

14:36.572 --> 14:40.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, now you put that away.</font>

14:40.304 --> 14:42.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> Breakfast is already taken care of.</font>

14:43.305 --> 14:45.303
Anna, is there
no end to your talents?

14:45.304 --> 14:47.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, when does it end?</font>

14:47.304 --> 14:51.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's no problem, we don't want
you two to do anything.</font>

14:51.304 --> 14:54.303
Perhaps you should digest
and excrete it for us too.

14:54.304 --> 14:56.303
All right, that was a bit much.

14:56.304 --> 14:59.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> I might take a couple
of these for the monkeys.</font>

14:59.304 --> 15:01.303
<font color="#11FF11"> What monkeys?</font>

15:01.304 --> 15:03.303
The monkeys at the zoo.

15:03.304 --> 15:05.303
<font color="#11FF11"> What about the monastery?</font>

15:05.304 --> 15:07.305
No, they don't have
monkeys at a monastery.

15:09.304 --> 15:11.304
You're thinking of monks.

15:13.304 --> 15:15.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> We thought we were looking
round the monastery first.</font>

15:15.304 --> 15:17.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, we thought we'd go to the zoo
first,</font>

15:17.572 --> 15:20.437
because mornings at the best time
to beat the crowds. <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Right.</font>

15:20.438 --> 15:24.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Actually, we've been thinking
that we might struggle to do both.</font>

15:24.304 --> 15:25.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, dear.</font>

15:25.839 --> 15:27.437
<font color="#FFFF00"> Looks like we'll have to choose.</font>

15:27.438 --> 15:29.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, what's it going to be?</font>

15:29.304 --> 15:30.438
<font color="#00FFFF"> Toby?</font>

15:32.304 --> 15:33.838
<font color="#11FF11"> Right. Erm...</font>

15:33.839 --> 15:35.838
<font color="#11FF11"> The thing is... </font>What?

15:35.839 --> 15:40.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> Now, Toby, don't start making a fuss
about my allergies to animals.</font>

15:42.304 --> 15:45.305
<font color="#FFFF00"> You've never mentioned that before.
Which animals?</font>

15:47.304 --> 15:48.304
<font color="#11FF11"> Penguins.</font>

15:50.839 --> 15:53.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Penguins? </font>Yep.</font>

15:53.304 --> 15:56.437
It's amazing what you can
p-p-p-pick up from them.

15:56.438 --> 16:00.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, would you mind awfully if we
play safe and avoid the zoo?</font>

16:01.304 --> 16:05.303
Look, Lucy didn't want
me to mention this,

16:05.304 --> 16:10.304
but today just happens
to be our anniversary.

16:10.305 --> 16:13.105
<font color="#11FF11"> Your anniversary's in December.</font>

16:13.106 --> 16:17.303
Not our wedding anniversary, the
anniversary of the first time we...

16:17.304 --> 16:19.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm not sure I'm ready to hear this.</font>

16:19.304 --> 16:22.303
Of the first time we met.

16:22.304 --> 16:24.303
Which was at the zoo.

16:24.304 --> 16:26.238
Wasn't it, Lucy?

16:26.239 --> 16:27.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah.</font>

16:27.304 --> 16:30.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I thought you met when
you were Lucy's lodger?</font>

16:30.304 --> 16:34.304
Yeah, we did, but she actually
found me at the zoo.

16:35.304 --> 16:37.305
<font color="#11FF11"> Was it a rehoming scheme?</font>

16:39.304 --> 16:43.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> So we always like to try and get
along to a zoo at this time of year.</font>

16:43.304 --> 16:46.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> If we can. </font>You must have been to a
lot of zoos over the years.</font>

16:46.304 --> 16:48.303
Yeah, we have.

16:48.304 --> 16:50.304
London, Whipsnade...

16:52.304 --> 16:53.304
..Babylon.

16:53.305 --> 16:59.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, why don't we go to the zoo,
but avoid the penguins?</font>

16:59.304 --> 17:02.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I tell you what.
Why don't you two go,</font>

17:02.304 --> 17:05.105
<font color="#00FFFF"> and we'll stay behind
and get started on dinner?</font>

17:05.106 --> 17:07.570
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, no, we don't want
you to miss out.</font>

17:07.571 --> 17:10.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> And besides, I'm cooking tonight.</font>

17:10.304 --> 17:12.105
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, no.</font>

17:12.106 --> 17:13.971
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're cooking all weekend, remember?</font>

17:13.972 --> 17:15.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, I won't hear of it.</font>

17:15.839 --> 17:17.570
<font color="#FFFF00"> You've done far too much already.</font>

17:17.571 --> 17:21.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> And besides, I wanted to share with
you the first meal we ate together.</font>

17:21.304 --> 17:22.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> At the zoo.</font>

17:22.305 --> 17:24.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Was it peanuts?</font>

17:24.304 --> 17:27.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Do you remember what it was, Lee?</font>

17:27.304 --> 17:29.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Was it spag bol?</font>

17:29.304 --> 17:30.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes, it was!</font>

17:30.972 --> 17:33.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> And so we're cooking
tonight, aren't we, Lee?</font>

17:33.304 --> 17:35.303
What were you going to cook?

17:35.304 --> 17:37.304
I mean, yes, we are!

17:39.304 --> 17:41.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, zoo first</font>

17:41.304 --> 17:43.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> and then spag bol.</font>

17:43.304 --> 17:46.238
<font color="#FFFF00"> If that's OK with you?</font>

17:46.239 --> 17:49.238
<font color="#00FFFF"> How could we possibly object?</font>

17:49.239 --> 17:52.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> Toby, c-c-can you think
of the way we could object?</font>

17:57.705 --> 18:00.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're not a very good liar.</font>
I don't have to be.

18:00.304 --> 18:03.238
It might not have been at the zoo,
but today just happens

18:03.239 --> 18:05.437
to be the anniversary
of the first day we met.

18:05.438 --> 18:07.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, is it?</font>

18:07.304 --> 18:08.438
See, I AM a good liar.

18:12.304 --> 18:14.304
THUNDER RUMBLES

18:18.304 --> 18:19.437
Did you enjoy that?

18:19.438 --> 18:23.303
<font color="#11FF11"> I can honestly say I will remember
that day for years to come.</font>

18:23.304 --> 18:25.105
<font color="#FFFF00"> Me too.</font>

18:25.106 --> 18:27.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> How often do you get
the chance to see a gazelle?</font>

18:27.304 --> 18:30.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, we saw a few on our
four-night safari in Kenya.</font>

18:30.304 --> 18:33.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes, but how often you get the
chance to see a gazelle</font>

18:33.304 --> 18:36.303
<font color="#11FF11"> in a ten-foot enclosure being fed
Quavers by a toddler?</font>

18:36.304 --> 18:37.304
Music?

18:37.305 --> 18:39.304
I know how you two
like the Italian classics,

18:39.305 --> 18:42.105
so this one's especially
for you guys.

18:42.106 --> 18:44.303

18:44.304 --> 18:46.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Is this Joe Dolce? </font>Sure is!

18:46.304 --> 18:49.704
Don't tell me, it was playing
on the day you first met? <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Yep!</font>

18:49.705 --> 18:53.303
# What's-a matter you? Hey!
Gotta no respect? #

18:53.304 --> 18:56.105
<font color="#11FF11"> I wouldn't exactly
call it classical.</font>

18:56.106 --> 18:58.105
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's a bit loud.</font>

18:58.106 --> 19:00.303
# ..It's-a not so bad... #

19:00.304 --> 19:02.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Could you turn it down a touch?</font>

19:02.304 --> 19:04.304
# ..Ah, shaddap-a you face! #

19:10.304 --> 19:14.303
Will you also be wearing pyjamas for
dinner tonight, darling?

19:14.304 --> 19:15.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Of course.</font>

19:15.305 --> 19:19.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> But I'm thoroughly enjoying
our anniversary so far.</font>

19:19.304 --> 19:20.304
Me too.

19:20.305 --> 19:21.571
It's brilliant.

19:21.572 --> 19:24.303
Tomorrow, let's make
them go to Laser Quest.

19:24.304 --> 19:28.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> I think our Joe-Dolce-themed
spag bol night will be enough.</font>

19:28.304 --> 19:30.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Then we're even.</font>

19:30.304 --> 19:34.303
Not quite. We're still leaving
before they do tomorrow morning.

19:34.304 --> 19:35.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Not this again.</font>

19:35.305 --> 19:37.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> No-one leaves early
so others clean up.</font>

19:37.304 --> 19:40.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's all in your head.</font>
You wait, they will try it.

19:40.304 --> 19:44.303
So, you're not annoyed that I lied
about it being our anniversary?

19:44.304 --> 19:47.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, it doesn't count as a lie
if you use it to get something</font>

19:47.304 --> 19:48.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> you really want.</font>

19:48.305 --> 19:51.303
I must remember
to tell the kids that.

19:51.304 --> 19:53.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Anyway, it was a necessary evil.</font>

19:53.304 --> 19:56.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Anna's my friend but, my God,
she's pushy sometimes.</font>

19:56.304 --> 19:59.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's like Airbnb-ing
in Hitler's bunker.</font>

19:59.304 --> 20:00.971
Toby's just as bad.

20:00.972 --> 20:03.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, he just does
whatever Anna wants.</font>

20:03.304 --> 20:05.438
<font color="#FFFF00"> He's like Siri,
but with less initiative.</font>

20:07.304 --> 20:08.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hi, Toby.</font>

20:08.305 --> 20:10.571
Yeah, the old "he's standing
behind you" routine

20:10.572 --> 20:13.972
doesn't really work if they're
in a different room.

20:17.304 --> 20:18.437
Hello.

20:18.438 --> 20:21.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Just popped out
to the car to get a book.</font>

20:21.304 --> 20:23.303
Didn't see you standing there.

20:23.304 --> 20:24.571
<font color="#11FF11"> Right.</font>

20:24.572 --> 20:26.305
<font color="#11FF11"> See you at dinner, then.</font>

20:29.304 --> 20:31.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> Did you know he was standing there?</font>
Of course, Lee.</font>

20:31.972 --> 20:34.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> It was seeing his face
that reminds me to slag off him</font>

20:34.304 --> 20:35.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> and his wife!</font>

20:35.572 --> 20:37.303
Do you think you heard us?

20:37.304 --> 20:38.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't know!</font>

20:38.305 --> 20:41.303
Oh, God, we admitted we were lying
about our anniversary.

20:41.304 --> 20:43.303
And we compared him to a human Siri.

20:43.304 --> 20:45.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> You think that's bad -
I said being with Anna</font>

20:45.304 --> 20:48.105
<font color="#FFFF00"> was like sharing
a cottage with Hitler.</font>

20:48.106 --> 20:50.303
Well, if he is like Siri,
maybe he misheard and thought

20:50.304 --> 20:53.303
you said it was like sharing
porridge with Bette Midler.

20:53.304 --> 20:55.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, God. </font>Well, it could be worse.

20:55.304 --> 20:56.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> How?</font>

20:56.572 --> 21:00.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> If I'd called her a stuck-up witch
married to a neutered poodle?</font>

21:03.304 --> 21:05.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Forgot to lock the boot.</font>

21:05.304 --> 21:07.304
CAR ALARM CHIRRUPS

21:19.106 --> 21:22.304
All right, you big ugly knobheads?

21:23.305 --> 21:27.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm sorry? </font>I was just saying to Lucy
how it's great with friends

21:27.304 --> 21:30.303
that you can jokily insult them
and no-one takes you seriously.

21:30.304 --> 21:32.303
Wasn't I, you fat smelly muppet?

21:32.304 --> 21:35.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> What are you doing?
I thought we were cooking tonight.</font>

21:35.972 --> 21:37.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> And we decided not to let you.</font>

21:37.305 --> 21:40.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Why? </font>You can't cook
on your anniversary, Lucy.</font>

21:40.304 --> 21:42.303
<font color="#11FF11"> No, it's your special day.</font>

21:42.304 --> 21:44.303
Well, it's not that special.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.303
It's not our real anniversary.

21:46.304 --> 21:47.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> We know.</font>

21:47.305 --> 21:50.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's the anniversary
of the day you met.</font>

21:50.304 --> 21:51.971
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#00FFFF"> At the zoo. </font>With the spag bol.</font>

21:51.972 --> 21:54.304
<font color="#11FF11"> And Shaddap You Face.</font>

21:55.572 --> 21:58.437
<font color="#11FF11"> How long were you stood
at that window? </font>Why do you ask?</font>

21:58.438 --> 22:02.303
I'm always scratching me arse
when I think no-one's watching.

22:02.304 --> 22:03.838
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, I didn't see anything.</font>

22:03.839 --> 22:05.303
Did you hear anything?

22:05.304 --> 22:07.304
<font color="#11FF11"> How loud were you scratching it?</font>

22:15.304 --> 22:18.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's good of you to dress
for dinner tonight, Lee.</font>

22:18.304 --> 22:21.303
Well, you made such an effort
we thought we should.

22:21.304 --> 22:23.303
<font color="#11FF11"> And it's your anniversary.</font>

22:23.304 --> 22:25.437
<font color="#00FFFF"> How many years ago
did you meet, exactly?</font>

22:25.438 --> 22:27.303
Seven.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.305
<font color="#11FF11"> You've got a son older than that.</font>

22:31.304 --> 22:33.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> He means 2007.</font>

22:33.304 --> 22:35.704
<font color="#FFFF00"> Anyway, enough about us.
What do you guys do</font>

22:35.705 --> 22:37.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> to celebrate your anniversaries?</font>

22:37.304 --> 22:40.238
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, nothing special,
just the traditional stuff.</font>

22:40.239 --> 22:42.106
Two minutes' silence?

22:43.304 --> 22:46.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, we're certainly not
like you two, with your big</font>

22:46.304 --> 22:48.304
<font color="#11FF11"> romantic, fanciful celebrations.</font>

22:51.304 --> 22:52.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> This food is lovely.</font>

22:52.305 --> 22:55.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, make sure you leave room
for dessert, because Anna has made</font>

22:55.304 --> 22:57.303
<font color="#11FF11"> something very special for you.</font>

22:57.304 --> 22:59.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, don't be silly, Toby.</font>

22:59.304 --> 23:01.437
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's nothing much.
I just had to cobble something</font>

23:01.438 --> 23:05.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> together from a few basic
ingredients because,</font>

23:05.304 --> 23:09.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> obviously, we had no idea
it was your anniversary.</font>

23:09.304 --> 23:12.105
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's only the anniversary
of the first day we met.</font>

23:12.106 --> 23:13.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, you can't play it down now.</font>

23:13.304 --> 23:16.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Not now we've seen how
important it is to you.</font>

23:16.304 --> 23:18.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Happy anniversary.</font>

23:18.304 --> 23:19.571
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, watch that flame, Anna.</font>

23:19.572 --> 23:22.304
<font color="#11FF11"> Don't want anybody's pants on fire.</font>

23:25.239 --> 23:26.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> We certainly don't, Toby.</font>

23:26.304 --> 23:28.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> And tell them the other
thing we decided.</font>

23:28.304 --> 23:30.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Ah, yeah.</font>

23:30.304 --> 23:33.571
<font color="#11FF11"> We feel really bad about getting
in the way of your romantic break,</font>

23:33.572 --> 23:36.838
<font color="#11FF11"> so to let you have the last
little bit of the weekend</font>

23:36.839 --> 23:38.303
<font color="#11FF11"> all to yourselves...</font>

23:38.304 --> 23:41.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're leaving a few hours
early tomorrow.</font>

23:42.304 --> 23:44.303
See!

23:44.304 --> 23:47.304
<font color="#11FF11"> What? </font>You're not pulling that one
on us.

23:47.305 --> 23:49.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> But it's your anniversary.</font>

23:49.304 --> 23:51.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, come off it, we know you know.</font>

23:51.304 --> 23:53.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Know what? </font>You know.

23:53.304 --> 23:56.303
And we know you know we know.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Is that another Joe Dolce song?</font>

23:58.304 --> 24:01.303
You heard our conversation
through the window.

24:01.304 --> 24:03.704
<font color="#11FF11"> Did I? What conversation?</font>

24:03.705 --> 24:06.303
The conversation about us
inventing our anniversary

24:06.304 --> 24:08.305
so we could get our own way.

24:10.305 --> 24:12.839
<font color="#FFFF00"> You did hear that, didn't you?</font>

24:15.304 --> 24:17.105
<font color="#11FF11"> Course I heard it!</font>

24:17.106 --> 24:20.303
<font color="#11FF11"> As if it wasn't obvious that Lee
was lying right from the start.</font>

24:20.304 --> 24:24.238
<font color="#00FFFF"> Watching Lee thinking on his feet
is like watching our son explain</font>

24:24.239 --> 24:28.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> that a ghost got in
and ate all the Jaffa Cakes.</font>

24:28.304 --> 24:31.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Nobody celebrates the anniversary
of the day they met.</font>

24:31.304 --> 24:33.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> You don't remember the day we met?</font>

24:33.304 --> 24:35.305
<font color="#11FF11"> I said celebrate, not remember.</font>

24:38.304 --> 24:40.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I can't believe you went
along with it, Lucy.</font>

24:40.304 --> 24:43.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, maybe it was a bit far-fetched
saying I met Lee at the zoo.</font>

24:43.305 --> 24:46.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Actually, that's the one
part that did ring true.</font>

24:46.304 --> 24:50.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look, I'm sorry, but the reason
we did it was because...</font>

24:50.304 --> 24:52.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> Please try not to be
too offended, but...</font>

24:52.972 --> 24:55.437
<font color="#FFFF00"> We just thought that
your behaviour was a bit...</font>

24:55.438 --> 24:57.971
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> ..pushy. </font>Pushy? How?</font>

24:57.972 --> 25:00.304
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, we don't need to go
into all the little details.</font>

25:00.305 --> 25:02.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, go on, tell me. Now!</font>

25:02.304 --> 25:06.238
<font color="#00FFFF"> How am I pushy?
Go on, how am I pushy? How?!</font>

25:06.239 --> 25:08.303
Well, you took the bigger bedroom.

25:08.304 --> 25:10.303
<font color="#11FF11"> You said you didn't mind about that.</font>

25:10.304 --> 25:13.105
Oh, we're liars, you should have
worked that out by now!

25:13.106 --> 25:15.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> And it wasn't just the room,
it was all sorts of things.</font>

25:15.572 --> 25:18.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> The food, the music,
dressing for dinner -</font>

25:18.304 --> 25:19.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> everything.</font>

25:19.839 --> 25:21.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I see.</font>

25:21.304 --> 25:25.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I'd be lying if I said
you were the first to say it.</font>

25:25.304 --> 25:28.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Other people have told me
similar things in the past.</font>

25:28.304 --> 25:31.304
<font color="#11FF11"> Their bodies still
haven't been discovered.</font>

25:33.106 --> 25:36.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> And I admit, we do like
things a certain way.</font>

25:36.304 --> 25:39.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Especially me,
I can come across as bossy.</font>

25:39.304 --> 25:43.303
<font color="#11FF11"> And perhaps sometimes we do take
things a little bit far.</font>

25:43.304 --> 25:44.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm sorry.</font>

25:44.305 --> 25:47.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> Why don't you take
our bedroom tonight?</font>

25:47.304 --> 25:50.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, thank you...</font>
We don't want your bedroom.</font>

25:50.304 --> 25:52.971
We could all sleep in the same bed.

25:52.972 --> 25:55.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> We don't really go
in for partner swapping.</font>

25:55.304 --> 25:57.838
<font color="#00FFFF"> I suggested it once,
but apparently you have to take</font>

25:57.839 --> 26:00.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> your own husband back afterwards.</font>

26:01.438 --> 26:05.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> We're sorry. This was supposed
to be a relaxing break for us all.</font>

26:05.304 --> 26:08.303
Well, we've still got
half a day tomorrow. <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Exactly.</font>

26:08.304 --> 26:10.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> And we'll be going to that
monastery.</font>

26:10.304 --> 26:13.303
<font color="#FFFF00"> But only if that's
what you'd like to do, of course.</font>

26:13.304 --> 26:15.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> That would be lovely, thank you.</font>

26:15.304 --> 26:17.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm sorry we made you uncomfortable.</font>

26:17.304 --> 26:18.571
<font color="#FFFF00"> And I'm sorry we lied.</font>

26:18.572 --> 26:21.303
<font color="#11FF11"> And I'm sorry we took
the bigger bedroom.</font>

26:21.304 --> 26:23.303
And I'm sorry we compared you
to a poodle,

26:23.304 --> 26:25.304
and said Anna was like Hitler.

26:35.304 --> 26:37.704
How long were you stood
at that window?

26:37.705 --> 26:40.303
<font color="#11FF11"> Only a few seconds.</font>

26:40.304 --> 26:42.303
So you didn't hear us say that bit?

26:42.304 --> 26:43.304
<font color="#11FF11"> No.</font>

26:43.305 --> 26:45.303
Right.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.303
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're leaving first in the morning.</font>

26:47.304 --> 26:48.304
<font color="#00FFFF"> You two can clear up.</font>

26:48.305 --> 26:50.304
Yeah, that's fine.

26:53.305 --> 26:57.238
# Yeah, not going out
Not staying in

26:57.239 --> 27:00.303
# Just hanging around with my head
in a spin

27:00.304 --> 27:03.303
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

27:03.304 --> 27:06.303
# We're not going out

27:06.304 --> 27:09.839
# We are not going out. #
