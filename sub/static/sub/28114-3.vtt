00:39.740 --> 00:42.042
Are-are you ready for your...
for your film?

00:42.076 --> 00:43.744
Wait. And go.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.879
- He's got the clap.
What?

00:45.913 --> 00:48.449
You schmuck!
You're ruining my story.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.119
Should've wore a jimmy hat.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.021
Oh, I don't wear jimmy hats.
I never have.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.024
-Mm-hmm.
-They impede sensation.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.726
And by the way...

00:58.759 --> 01:00.128
Who-who get...

01:00.161 --> 01:03.030
who gets the clap anymore, hmm?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.897
Guys who don't wear jimmy hats.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.135
Oh, sheesh.

01:07.168 --> 01:11.038
The women my age stopped getting
their periods 70 years ago.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.773
My parts are grinding to a halt,

01:12.806 --> 01:15.576
except for my follicle
production.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.246
Oh, my God. Me, too, Rosie.
Me, too!

01:20.814 --> 01:24.252
-But you look so beautiful.
-Oh, I look how I look.

01:24.285 --> 01:28.556
Ah, you know what? You'll never
believe what I just found.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.259
I was looking through
my projects folder,

01:31.292 --> 01:35.529
and I found a script
written by me and...

01:37.097 --> 01:39.467
Tamara Gonsales.
Yeah!

01:40.801 --> 01:44.104
Tamara Gonsales?
You and I.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.974
We wrote a script together.
Remember?

01:48.142 --> 01:49.443
Oh...

01:49.477 --> 01:53.414
Alan, I think
you're confusing me.

01:53.447 --> 01:57.151
You know I'm Sam, right?
I'm Phil and Murray's daughter.

01:57.185 --> 02:01.088
Oh... Oh, shit.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.492
This is embarrassing.

02:04.525 --> 02:07.495
- Oh. You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:08.729 --> 02:12.099
Murray.
God rest his soul.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.702
What a pain in the ass.

02:14.735 --> 02:18.339
-Your father was a funny man.
-Yeah.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.108
- Oh, and dirty.
- Now, wait a minute.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.778
I was the funniest. Your father
was the second funniest.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.014
Ask your mother,
she'll tell you.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.116
Loved your mother. Oh.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.186
She-she was scary but classy.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.322
She was so mean.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.824
-Mean as a snake.
-Hmm.

02:36.857 --> 02:40.561
She's with a shvartze now.
Yeah. I heard about it.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.062
Rocket, you can't say that word.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.798
I can. You can't.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.067
It was delicious,
her-her rudeness.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.136
But even wh... even when she was

02:49.169 --> 02:52.039
really, really, awfully mean,

02:52.072 --> 02:55.175
she still had this little
twinkle in her eye.

02:55.209 --> 02:59.012
Always made me feel like,
"I got a shot."

03:01.282 --> 03:04.818
-Her accent is what got me.
-Her tits are what got me.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.154
-Irwin!
-She was gorgeous.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.423
-She still is.
-I like that.

03:09.457 --> 03:13.361
A daughter who appreciates
her parents.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.497
Not like my motherless,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.766
deadbeat, drug-addicted son.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.268
Irwin.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.436
-Easy, yeah?
-How about this?

03:26.374 --> 03:28.876
He's a piece of meat
with two eyes.

03:28.909 --> 03:29.877
Oh...

03:29.910 --> 03:32.546
At least his mother is dead.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.648
She didn't have to live
to see this.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.921
This guy and his silver linings.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.897
Rosie.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.266
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.801
I got one for you.
I got one.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.403
I got-I got one.
I got one for you.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.906
Okay?
Um, a Murray Fox proverb.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.073
Oh.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.545
You get stuck...

04:04.578 --> 04:06.314
in writing...

04:06.347 --> 04:09.717
- Huh.
- ...in marriage, in life,

04:09.750 --> 04:11.419
you get stuck...

04:12.753 --> 04:14.722
"Shake the Cocktail."

04:14.755 --> 04:16.957
-Oh, yeah!
-All right, shake the cocktail.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.759
Shake the cocktail!

04:20.192 --> 04:22.763
-I love it. Thank you, Rocket.
-You schtuck.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.264
Schtuck?

04:24.298 --> 04:27.267
He can't say schtum,
but he says schtuck!

04:32.673 --> 04:35.142
- You know your sister is in a summer
blockbuster. - Uh-huh.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.945
She's gonna be the next Lara
Croft: Middle-aged Tomb Raider.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.313
Is that the monster one?

04:39.347 --> 04:41.349
A mother.
I'm playing a mother.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.183
Everyone's miserable.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.853
I was gonna complain
about the AC in my trailer.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.020
Well, at least the money's good.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.956
Otherwise,
I'd have peaced day one.

04:48.989 --> 04:52.192
No, it's not. They're paying us
barely scale on this.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.293
Not me, baby.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.797
- Oh, damn.
- I'm making

04:56.830 --> 04:58.799
a fraction of what the actor
who's playing my husband

04:58.832 --> 05:01.201
is making, and nobody
knows who the hell he is.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.270
They're cheating on turnaround.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.038
No one's ever heard
of union rules.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.308
It's a shitshow,
and it's gonna make a fortune.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.943
It's a nice paycheck.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.013
A nice paycheck you were asking
for, that's what you wanted.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.716
There was a manager
on set yesterday,

05:15.749 --> 05:18.652
said we should consider
filing a grievance for, like,

05:18.686 --> 05:22.022
- a stunt adjustment, or some shit like
that. - I'm sure your manager's

05:22.055 --> 05:24.458
all over this, but I'm getting
Donte a stunt adjustment,

05:24.492 --> 05:27.461
and I'm filing a grievance on
his behalf and Princess' behalf.

05:27.495 --> 05:30.531
-You want in?
-Ooh. How much are they getting?

05:30.564 --> 05:32.533
-200 bucks.
-Mm.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.668
So you should talk
to your manager, Tressa.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.405
I mean, you're Sam Fox, number
two on the call sheet. Come on.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.673
-Number three.
-My client's ten.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.876
And that makes sense, as I tend
to gravitate toward men

05:42.910 --> 05:45.679
of lower status in life
and on the set.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.681
You're so funny!

05:48.716 --> 05:50.050
Who's this manager?

05:50.083 --> 05:53.086
I don't know.
Some cool lady with a face.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.390
What cool lady with a face?
You talking about Boatie Trell?

05:56.424 --> 05:58.526
No, not a Boatie.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.728
-Mer Kodis?
-That one.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.696
-Are these names? Really?
-Mm-hmm.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.264
She make a pass at you?

06:04.297 --> 06:06.700
What? No.
Calm down.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.411
I'm straight.
I'm a straight girl.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.747
- I won't tell.
- She's a flipper, Sam.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.616
Flip-per. Woo, boy,

06:22.650 --> 06:23.951
you are right up her alley.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.719
That's her thing, she likes
to flip straight girls.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.054
She's a flipper.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.022
-Stop saying flipper.
-Is she cute?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.158
I dated a lesbian once.
Business school.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.295
She's got to be cute if she's
a successful serial flipper.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.597
I don't know.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.466
For the record, I don't hate
where this is going.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.067
I always wanted you
to have a girl phase.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.802
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.136
-I didn't.
-Mm-hmm?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.238
I mean, I don't think
it's in me.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.874
I mean,

06:46.907 --> 06:49.810
I like it... in me.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.580
Mom, gross.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.982
You guys are so binary.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.984
I'm not sure what that means,

06:57.017 --> 06:58.986
but I'm pretty sure
I'm all about that "D."

07:02.422 --> 07:04.958
I'm with Frankie...
I don't see sexual preference.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.093
That is such bullshit.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.929
-Mer Kodis is danger, okay?
Listen to me. -Yup,

07:08.962 --> 07:11.298
very, so straight.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.667
Is that something
people are still doing?

07:13.701 --> 07:16.604
Yup.
Still doing straight.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.840
I do straight
with straight men... people.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.446
I've said nothing.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.749
She was on set,
giving her client advice.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.518
I saw her for,
like, ten seconds,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.520
and now all of a sudden
you're acting like

07:32.553 --> 07:34.955
we're running away together.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.926
Jesus. You're so sensitive
and jealous.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.528
I am not jealous.

07:40.561 --> 07:44.297
Okay. Okay. Can we not have
a feelings talk?

07:44.331 --> 07:47.601
I'm not having a feelings talk,
I'm just giving you some tips.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.638
I'm good.
I'm all good.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.306
I feel like you just
had a feelings talk.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.446
-Hello! Darling...
-Hi.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.815
-...look what I brought you.
-Oh, Phil. I don't.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.951
-Hi, Walter.
-Hello, Sam.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.286
Don't bring that into the house.
I have five of those already.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.021
Yes, but it's
a manual can opener.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.623
-I told you I don't want you
to bring -If you mean to...

08:09.657 --> 08:11.124
-any more stuff to my house.
-Well, I want you to have it

08:11.158 --> 08:12.359
and I'm going
to leave it, anyway.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.460
For the lady.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.296
We have to think about
the scenarios

08:16.329 --> 08:17.698
of disaster very carefully.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.832
-Mm.
-I'm the president

08:18.866 --> 08:21.301
of the emergency
preparedness committee.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.003
Voted unanimously into office.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.573
Well, I've seen
my share of disasters.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.411
Are we staying for dinner, Phil?

08:31.444 --> 08:33.380
Dinner.
I hadn't thought...

08:33.413 --> 08:36.416
No, no, no, now,
we don't want to intrude.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.385
What's this?
Risotto?

08:39.419 --> 08:41.488
-Mm.
-Oh, Walter, we must.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.791
Then we must.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.829
Hmm. It's interesting
how plain it tastes.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.404
Hi.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.438
-Hey.
-Hi.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.907
I know who you are.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.875
-Hi. Reiki..
-Sam.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.444
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to finally meet you.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.779
What's up?

09:05.813 --> 09:08.548
Sorrow, your dad's here.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.718
They've been giving
each other tattoos.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.553
She's on the toilet.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.956
Whoa, is that Sharpie?

09:15.989 --> 09:18.291
Are you crazy?
It's eyeliner.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.227
-Of course.
-Can Sorrow

09:20.260 --> 09:21.762
and Pepper sleep over tonight?

09:21.795 --> 09:24.097
-I don't know, it's a...
-Please?

09:24.131 --> 09:25.532
-We're talking about a school night.
-Please, please.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.767
How do we feel about that?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.602
-I'm good.
-I'm good.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.470
Yes!

09:30.503 --> 09:32.372
-So, come on in.
-Great.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.141
Did you guys eat?

09:34.174 --> 09:36.043
-No.
-Stay. Stay.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.711
It smells delicious.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.413
-It is delicious. Come on.
-Okay.

09:40.447 --> 09:45.152
Don't you want to check the car?

09:45.185 --> 09:47.320
Oh, God, yes, yes.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.956
-What...
-Great.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.758
-What are you checking?
-Just simmer down.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.994
Oh, your art is so beautiful.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.663
I love it.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.397
Yeah, I love it, too.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.266
-Yeah.
-Come on.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.968
Let me wine you and dine you.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.269
Thank you.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.972
-Reiki, this is my mom, Phil.
-Hi.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.440
-Hello.
-And her special friend Walter.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.810
-Walter, hi.
-Nice to meet you.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.779
-That's my bro Marion.
-Hello. Nice to meet you.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.280
-And the rest.
-Hey.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.116
-I'm Rich, hi. I'm the rest.
-Hi, Rich. Hi.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.485
-Red or white?
-Anything nonalcoholic.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.453
-All right, I got you.
-So, you're the decorator.

10:20.487 --> 10:21.689
I am.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.491
You're with Sunny's bum
of a husband?

10:24.524 --> 10:25.793
You should meet my mother.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.263
He's her ex-husband.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.800
And I find him charming
in every way.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.969
-Every way?
-Mm-hmm. All the ways.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.271
Well, there's a lid
for every pot.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.008
Yeah, well, his lid
certainly fits my pot.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.643
Cheers.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.881
Cheers.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.282
Everyone...

10:49.316 --> 10:52.485
this is Dexter.
Hello.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.988
-The fuck?
-And his handler Linda,

10:55.022 --> 10:56.556
-as required by state law.
-Hi. Jump.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.459
- Yeah, check this out. He jumps.
- Come on.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.660
Look at that.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.529
-Yeah.
-Get it off me. Get it off me.

11:02.562 --> 11:03.997
Get it off.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.800
My God. Frankie! Jason!

11:06.834 --> 11:10.070
Girls, get down here right now!

11:10.103 --> 11:12.039
-Are you okay, Mom? It's okay.
-Stay.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.473
I love monkeys.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.075
She does.
She loves 'em, yeah.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.576
Her birthday's next week,
so I found her one.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.145
We've been hanging out all day.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.682
Oh.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.517
Mom, Mom, can we keep it?

11:24.551 --> 11:26.319
- Well, I mean, it's just a rental, so...
- Can we rent it?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.821
Mom, can we rent it? Mom?

11:27.855 --> 11:29.256
-Bro!
-Mom, please.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.192
He's here now.
Play with him now. Ow.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.738
That's it?
He catches a grape? That's, uh,

11:44.772 --> 11:46.774
a little underwhelming.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.908
A grape out of your ear, maybe.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.376
You should get him
some cymbals or something.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.378
Honey, you want to throw
a grape to the monkey?

11:51.411 --> 11:53.781
It feels very intense

11:53.814 --> 11:55.715
to have a primate
in the house.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.784
Mm.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.955
Oh. She's not into it.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.190
-You see his shorts?
-Yeah, I did.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.925
-Is that what those are?
-Yeah, those are shorts.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.229
Mm...

12:09.262 --> 12:12.032
What about Jeff's new lady?
I mean...

12:12.065 --> 12:14.034
holy crap, right?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.568
I know.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.237
-That face.
-Yeah, you think it's real,

12:17.270 --> 12:18.972
-or work done?
-I don't know.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.608
But good for him.
Wow.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.143
How old do you think she is?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.312
Who cares? She's fantastic.
So sexy.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.115
Mm.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.087
It's still half
plus seven, right?

12:34.121 --> 12:36.389
I mean, that's the rule.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.392
Half...
Half your age, plus seven.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.294
Wow, that's strong.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.596
Well, I'm breaking that rule.
My new boyfriend's 25.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.731
Get out of here.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.099
Mm-hmm.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.806
I wonder if his friends
whisper about me like this.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.242
Whether or not
you've had injections

12:55.275 --> 12:56.676
in your lips, you mean?

12:56.709 --> 12:58.745
How dare you.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.847
Of course I have.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.621
Oh, Jesus,
you guys hotboxed the garage.

13:08.655 --> 13:09.823
-Dinner's ready.
-You want? You want?

13:09.857 --> 13:11.124
Yerp.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.726
Does she...
know that I'm... out here?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.763
Careful, it's really strong.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.698
Uh, yeah.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.500
-Is this your boyfriend's?
-What? Yeah.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.969
That's not old people weed.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.537
-This'll kill you. I can't
have any more. -I can.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.672
I used to have to smoke
nine joints.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.640
Now it's one hit and...

13:27.674 --> 13:30.377
-Oh, yeah.
-...I'm a dolphin.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.546
- Oh... oh, wow.
- Yeah.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.182
How long were we there?

13:35.215 --> 13:38.151
- Hours, days...
- No. 30 minutes.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.352
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.988
-I came looking for you...
-Oh, that's good.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.289
...after 20 minutes.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.291
Is it weird that
I can't feel my hair?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.459
- No, that's not so...
- I have so little left.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.494
Can you usually feel your hair?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.865
You know, and then you get

13:51.899 --> 13:53.233
the onions and the shallots.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.535
Mm-hmm.
- And, um,

13:55.568 --> 13:59.139
you can either use, if you don't
have any tomatoes...

13:59.172 --> 14:02.475
-Oh.
-What?! My baby.

14:02.509 --> 14:06.646
Oh, oh, hi, baby!

14:06.679 --> 14:07.747
Hi, Mom.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.051
Hi from college.
We're making dinner.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.486
-Risotto. Say hi to everybody.
-Ooh.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.488
-Hi, darling Max.
-Hey, Max.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.525
Hi. Oh, hi, Gram.
Hi, Walter.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.227
Is it cold in the tundra?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.562
I haven't seen my legs
in, like, three weeks.

14:23.730 --> 14:24.864
You're wearing a tank top.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.034
Oh, I know, we, like,
crank up the heat.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.002
- Mom, I need to tell you...
- We got a monkey.

14:29.036 --> 14:32.072
- Hmm?
- Oh, my God!

14:32.105 --> 14:35.042
You wait until I leave
to get a monkey?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.877
-I don't know. Not ours.
-Oh.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.713
Did you order those
Korean face masks?

14:40.747 --> 14:42.849
Yes, I did.

14:45.919 --> 14:49.689
Honey, so how are you?
Are you making friends?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.358
Yeah, it's, uh, it's great.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.526
Everyone's really chill,
you know.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.128
I mean, it's different.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.696
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.099
That's good.
I'm so proud of you.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.469
So, Mom, I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna finish the semester.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.405
-But... -Oh, I got to
serve the plates now.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.207
I got to serve the... the...

15:07.240 --> 15:09.142
Finish... finish the semester?

15:09.176 --> 15:11.211
She may.
Pretty sure.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.412
She may finish the semester.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.951
We're doing a pop-up restaurant
in Echo Park.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.219
-Oh, really?
-What?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.420
-Yeah.
-That's right.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.223
Limited menu, mostly barbecue.
Small bites.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.058
Gauge investor interest.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.393
-Hmm.
-Aw, they're gonna love it.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.928
Yeah, he's a natural.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.397
I do a few things well.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.931
-Not like Sam.
-Aw.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.001
I didn't know you cooked.

15:34.034 --> 15:38.505
Well, you know,
Sunny hates eating.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.639
Mm.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.941
I don't like men in the kitchen.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.443
It seems undignified.
Do you know,

15:43.476 --> 15:46.279
my father severed
the top of his thumb off,

15:46.313 --> 15:49.582
and I didn't notice, but it had
gone right into the pastry,

15:49.616 --> 15:50.850
and I rolled it up.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.353
I think I ate
a bit of it, or just the nail.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.656
What is...

15:56.689 --> 15:58.858
-happening?
-But I've never told it.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.995
Did you ever hear this story?

16:02.029 --> 16:04.764
-Hello, hello, hello.
-Just the nail?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.899
- Oh.
- Hi.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.039
-Hello.
-Hi.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.612
Uh, am I interrupting?

16:19.646 --> 16:23.316
I just, um... Sorrow!

16:23.350 --> 16:25.718
Uh...

16:25.752 --> 16:27.387
she's staying.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.956
Yeah, they're doing, like,
a sleepover thing.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.524
I thought I was...
I mean, I'm staying

16:31.558 --> 16:33.193
at the house tonight, so...

16:33.226 --> 16:34.194
Hi, Mark.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.795
Hi.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.298
You guys, come in.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.732
Join us, come on.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.801
I made lemon risotto.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.703
It's got, like,
a million trillion calories.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.138
So good.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.673
Oh, it's so good.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.209
-Hi, hi, hi.
-Hi, I'm Mark.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.911
-Mwah. Hi, hi. -Hi. -Pleasure.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.747
-Marion. I didn't know you were in town.
-Hello, gorgeous.

16:54.781 --> 16:55.982
Mark. Hi, there.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.185
-Right this way, table waiting.
-Hi.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.387
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.854
Oh, good. Good. Okay.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.256
You guys sit together.
You can talk

17:03.290 --> 17:05.092
about money
and Republican-y stuff,

17:05.125 --> 17:07.827
- and I'll get you guys some bowls.
- Ha, ha.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.429
I'll be right back.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.765
So you're a Republican?

17:12.799 --> 17:14.201
Yes. Yes I am.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.736
-Still?
-Mm...

17:16.769 --> 17:19.906
-But he loves the gays.
-True. Can't get enough.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.342
Oh, um,

17:22.375 --> 17:25.345
Mark and I drank one
of your bottles of kombucha.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.013
-I'll replace it, I...
-No, it's no big deal.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.782
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.752
Do you all live together,
like in a commune?

17:32.785 --> 17:35.054
Oh. No.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.358
I can't even
share a bathroom. No.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.127
We share the house.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.795
The... the kids stay put.
We, um,

17:42.829 --> 17:45.198
-alternate days.
-You what?

17:45.232 --> 17:46.766
Sounds dreadful.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.868
It's called nesting, dear.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.570
I can hear you.
You don't have to shout.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.305
- It's working well.
- Yeah,

17:52.339 --> 17:53.973
the kids don't have
to move around, I get it.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.375
I thought the whole
point of getting divorced

17:55.408 --> 17:56.809
was that you don't
have to get annoyed

17:56.843 --> 17:58.478
at the empty pickle jar
in the fridge anymore,

17:58.511 --> 18:00.813
with the single pickle floating
around like a turd.

18:00.847 --> 18:04.451
I've always felt that about
a single pickle in a jar.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.918
-Looks like a turd?
-Yeah.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.154
Or that's the whole reason
for divorce?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.788
Jeff loves

18:08.821 --> 18:11.458
to leave his laundry
in the hamper,

18:11.491 --> 18:13.726
like there's some
magic laundry fairy

18:13.760 --> 18:15.728
that's just gonna go,
you know, like, "Poof."

18:15.762 --> 18:18.064
Hmm.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.899
That's... that's hilarious.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.802
Yeah. That happened once
in six months.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.904
So...

18:24.937 --> 18:26.773
Sounds awfully complicated.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.842
In our day, we just stayed
married and had affairs.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.687
- Mm.
- Oh, come on, darling.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.088
Eat up.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.258
That's really good.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.526
- You made this?
- Thank you. Oh, yeah.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.495
- Lovely, really good.
- Thank you.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.633
-Yeah, it's the framboise.
-Oh, is that what gives it that

18:53.666 --> 18:55.635
-little bit of brown there?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.937
It smells so good.
Bro, smell.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.606
Dessert's for children
and people don't care

18:59.639 --> 19:01.341
what they look like.
We need to talk.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.777
Oh. That's my brother's
serious voice.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.014
I want to talk to you
about Phil's mental state.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.682
Well, I don't.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.651
For example, she shouldn't
be driving a car.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.520
Oh, Jesus.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.154
Can you just please
give this to Duke?

19:35.408 --> 19:37.877
You've been saying this
for ten years now.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.547
Every time you see her,
you want to sell the house,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.749
take away her car
and put her in a home.

19:42.782 --> 19:46.185
She lost her American Express
card four times this summer.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.820
Yes, four.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.656
She lost her phone twice.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.425
And when she does her answer her
phone, she does it in an accent.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.093
-Not English.
-Yeah.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.929
That's because she gets
so many telemarketers.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.931
She doesn't want them
to know it's her.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.501
Hello?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.503
That's just smart.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.205
You won't think it's funny
when she really hurts herself

20:06.239 --> 20:07.840
or someone else.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.243
Let me ask you something.

20:10.277 --> 20:13.112
Do you have any intention
of moving to L.A.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.382
and driving her to bridge
every Tuesday?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.684
Or picking her up
from Ross Dress for Less

20:17.717 --> 20:20.687
or Jewish Council Thrift
on an hourly basis?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.889
I didn't think so.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.593
So, please, bro,
hoe your own row.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.228
What is my row, Sam?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.631
You know.
Doing bank shit.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.367
Money.
Being afraid of your wife.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.536
Basically never doing anything

20:36.569 --> 20:40.106
to help me, ever.
I handle Phil.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.216
God...

20:50.249 --> 20:52.218
He's right, Cookie.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.721
Could you and Mom

20:54.754 --> 20:56.889
have gone a little bit
easier on him?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.759
He's so wound up. He's got
such a chip on his shoulder.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.628
It wasn't intentional.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.062
He's the firstborn.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.897
The burned pancake.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.266
And the second child
is like a rewrite.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.235
Always comes out
a little better.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.737
Dad.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.105
-Yes?
-Let me ask you something.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.941
Mm-hmm?

21:14.974 --> 21:18.077
Do you think I should
take Phil's car away?

21:18.110 --> 21:19.479
Put her in a home?

21:19.512 --> 21:21.180
Let me ask you something.

21:21.213 --> 21:24.183
You ever win a knife fight
with a midget?

21:30.690 --> 21:34.527
Whoa.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.765
Uh, Truman Capote?

21:38.798 --> 21:41.033
-Long time ago.
-Very fat. Very, very, very fat.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.636
--Uh, Winston Churchill.
Chubby Checker.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.171
- Ponytail. With a ponytail.
- No, with a beard.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.474
- The, ugh...
- Jackie Gleason.

21:47.507 --> 21:50.109
-Fatty Arbuckle!
-Warrior. Rode a-rode a horse.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.879
-Fat horse rider?
-A very fat Oriental.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.515
-Other team!
-Genghis Khan.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.684
- Yes! - -Phil,
you cannot help them.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.152
I'm not under
your control, darling.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.788
It's upside down.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.323
Give!

22:04.357 --> 22:05.858
Black-and-white,
black-and-white.

22:05.892 --> 22:09.161
- Penguin!
- Yes!

22:09.195 --> 22:12.399
- That was good.
- Pickup truck.

22:24.043 --> 22:27.414
Hey, kiddo.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.416
What are you doing?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.995
That's a good girl.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.669
Here.
