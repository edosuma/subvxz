01:27.338 --> 01:28.923
Yeah!
(LAUGHS)

(LAUGHS) All right!

MAKALYA: Whoo-hoo!

01:51.279 --> 01:53.823
Madison, Makalya,
this is awesome!

01:53.906 --> 01:56.200
Best. Invention. Ever!

01:59.203 --> 02:00.997
I told you that modifying
the wing load ratio

02:01.080 --> 02:02.401
would generate
a much higher lift.

02:02.457 --> 02:03.499
Good call.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.793
Although I told you that
streamlining the airfoil

02:05.877 --> 02:07.211
would not only look better,

02:07.295 --> 02:09.005
but lower the drag coefficient.

02:09.088 --> 02:10.882
And you were so right.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.300
But I was right first.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.885
KARA: <i>Guys,
I think I found it!</i>

02:15.762 --> 02:18.765
The perfect spot for my
community garden project!

02:19.057 --> 02:20.767
I'm going in for a closer look!

02:24.020 --> 02:25.021
Whoa.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.148
Kara, watch your descent!

02:27.231 --> 02:29.651
Ease back on the throttle
or the engine might stall!

02:29.734 --> 02:31.319
Feels fine to me.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.613
You guys worry too much.

02:34.364 --> 02:35.698
Whoa!

02:36.991 --> 02:37.992
BOTH: Kara!

02:38.785 --> 02:39.994
Purge the fuel pump!

02:40.078 --> 02:41.162
Trim the rudder!

02:41.245 --> 02:42.413
And hold onto your earrings.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.165
Close the cowl flap!

02:44.248 --> 02:46.751

any of those words mean!</i>

03:58.614 --> 04:00.950
Baron Von Ravendale,
call the royal physician!

04:01.033 --> 04:03.077
Right away, Your Highness.

04:03.161 --> 04:04.912
I don't need a doctor.

04:04.996 --> 04:08.082
Seriously, Mom, Dad.
I'm fine.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.167
(SCREAMS)

04:10.168 --> 04:12.170
Nothing to worry about.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.885
Darling, you just
fell out of the sky.

04:18.968 --> 04:22.638
I believe that absolutely qualifies
as something to worry about!

04:22.764 --> 04:24.640
And another thing, young lady...
(HORN HONKING)

04:26.517 --> 04:27.935
(TIRES SCREECH)
(BOTH GASP)

04:28.019 --> 04:29.437
Are you okay?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.397
(SCOFFS) Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

04:31.481 --> 04:32.690
I'm fine...

04:34.233 --> 04:35.234
Oh.

04:35.902 --> 04:37.737
We'll fix you right up.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.490
Guys, lam so sorry.

04:40.573 --> 04:41.783
It's not your fault.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.285
We didn't anticipate the drop
in manifold pressure.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.369
Oh.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.289
Back to the digital
design board.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.624
Live and learn.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.419
Next time I'll remember
to purge the rudder.

04:53.503 --> 04:55.880
Cowl, thingy?

04:55.963 --> 04:58.549
There will be no
"Next time," young lady.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.802
What on earth
were you thinking?

05:00.885 --> 05:03.346
You could have been
critically injured or worse!

05:03.429 --> 05:06.015
It's no big deal!
I'm fine!

05:06.098 --> 05:08.810
Now, can we please talk about
something more important?

05:09.060 --> 05:11.729
Like the fact that
I found the best spot ever

05:11.813 --> 05:13.397
for my community
garden project!

05:13.523 --> 05:17.568
It's right near the creek, so the soil
gets plenty of water for irrigation.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.904
And everyone in
the kingdom can help.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.824
People can get outdoors,
get to know each other.

05:22.907 --> 05:25.284
You know, really connect!

05:25.576 --> 05:27.620
Kara, am I to understand

05:27.703 --> 05:29.247
that you just risked your life

05:29.330 --> 05:31.791
looking for a spot
to grow cucumbers?

05:31.916 --> 05:33.876
(LAUGHING) No!

05:34.418 --> 05:36.671
Not just cucumbers.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.507
I'm pretty sure we'll
plant zucchini, turnips.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.175
Maybe even some pea pods.

05:41.259 --> 05:43.386
This isn't amusing, Kara.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.514
Mom, Dad. I'm sorry.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.933
I didn't mean to
scare you like that.

05:49.225 --> 05:52.520
I just want to contribute
something to the kingdom!

05:52.603 --> 05:54.856
Of course, my dear. Ah!

05:55.439 --> 05:58.401
You could act as Grand Marshal
at the annual parade!

05:59.110 --> 06:00.361
(GRUNTS) Ow!

06:00.778 --> 06:02.780
I meant something important.

06:02.864 --> 06:04.699
Representing the royal family

06:04.782 --> 06:07.827
with a well-placed
wave is important.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.370
And safe.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.706
More like boring.

06:12.164 --> 06:16.335
Kara, you and your sisters are
the future of this kingdom

06:16.419 --> 06:20.047
and the world is a much more
dangerous place than you realize.

06:20.131 --> 06:22.383
Isn't that so, Baron?

06:22.466 --> 06:24.343
Without question, Your majesty.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.971
These are
troubling times, indeed.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.723
See? There. Ha.

06:28.806 --> 06:32.059
Our most wise and
insightful advisor agrees.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.562
And he has never
been wrong before.

06:40.610 --> 06:44.238
That's me, reliable to a fault.

06:44.322 --> 06:47.617

06:47.867 --> 06:49.744
But no more, Bruce.

06:49.827 --> 06:53.706
Now I shall finally claim
what is rightfully mine!

06:54.916 --> 06:57.084
Everyone knows it was my family

06:57.168 --> 07:00.630
who first claimed the Kingdom
of Windemere centuries ago!

07:00.922 --> 07:02.840
Granted, my great-great
Grandfather lost it

07:02.924 --> 07:05.259
during a rather foolish game
of rock-paper-scissors.

07:05.343 --> 07:06.594
But Still.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.679
It should belong to me!

07:08.763 --> 07:11.349
I want to sit in the big chair

07:11.432 --> 07:13.351
and wear the big crown.

07:14.018 --> 07:17.146
Not merely because I can
do a much better job

07:18.147 --> 07:20.191
but because I deserve it!

Uh-oh.

08:18.082 --> 08:19.291

08:19.959 --> 08:21.502
Why you...

08:22.670 --> 08:23.671
(GRUNTING)

08:23.754 --> 08:26.966
Do you have any idea
how long it took me

08:27.049 --> 08:29.468
to find the ingredients
for that elixir?

08:29.552 --> 08:31.387
All for naught!

08:31.470 --> 08:33.304
Down the drain!

08:33.847 --> 08:36.808
And now, I must start all over again!
(GASPING)

08:37.393 --> 08:39.186
I should truss you up
with that tongue

08:39.270 --> 08:41.647
and roast you like
a Cornish game hen.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.264
KARA: Who would
like some tea?

09:15.347 --> 09:18.476
Oh, you guys have to try
the jam, it's delicious.

MADISON: Have seen the latest

09:22.646 --> 09:25.733
Gabby, we should take
Corinne to the new zoo!

09:25.816 --> 09:28.944
It wasn't open yet when she
came to visit last summer.

09:29.028 --> 09:30.571
You like animals, right?

09:30.654 --> 09:32.782
Of course she
likes animals, Zooey!

09:32.865 --> 09:34.825
Who doesn't like animals?

09:35.159 --> 09:36.202
I don't.

out of control.</i>

09:38.329 --> 09:40.247
At the museum opening
a couple of days ago?

09:40.331 --> 09:42.750
My mom wouldn't
let me cut the ribbon

09:42.833 --> 09:45.586
because she thought the safety
scissors were too sharp.

09:47.505 --> 09:48.672
Not funny.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.007
If my parents had their way,

09:50.132 --> 09:52.259
I'd spend the rest of
my life throwing galas

09:52.343 --> 09:53.844
and perfecting my curtsey.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.597
It's called being
a Princess, Kara.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.765
What's wrong with that?

09:59.058 --> 10:01.310
I'm just saying
that hosting royal teas

10:01.393 --> 10:03.729
and going to parties sounds
pretty great to most people.

10:03.813 --> 10:06.273
And don't get me
started on all the shoes.

10:06.357 --> 10:08.609

my life isn't great.

10:08.692 --> 10:12.696
But all the ceremonial
stuff, it's not enough.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.698

are overreacting,

Headache?

11:12.256 --> 11:14.091
Muscle fatigue?
Did you eat the egg salad?

11:14.175 --> 11:16.468
Intestinal discomfort could be
an early sign of food poisoning.

ingestion of contaminated dairy,

will show up?

to be rescued?

Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) I was just
wondering if the royal family's

37:43.262 --> 37:45.431
had the chance to meet
Super Sparkle in person

37:45.514 --> 37:47.433
to thank her
for what she's done.

37:47.516 --> 37:48.726
Maybe even give her a medal.

a big enough pat on the back?

Don't be silly, dear.
Of course, she is.

incredibly grateful

to go up to them right now and yell,

I'm Super Sparkle!

you're proud of!"

making a difference,

No, you weren't.

01:04:38.834 --> 01:04:40.586
I was always jealous of you.

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:43.422
Your life just seems
so much better than mine.

01:04:43.631 --> 01:04:45.216
Trust me, it isn't,

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:48.094
not when you consider the way
I've been acting lately.

01:04:48.177 --> 01:04:50.763
