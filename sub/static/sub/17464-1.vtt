00:05.367 --> 00:07.779
When you're always youself all the time,

00:07.780 --> 00:09.941
it feels like you no longer exist.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.329
But there's this little part
of you that's insistent

00:13.330 --> 00:15.617
that you remember all the pain,

00:16.242 --> 00:18.099
and all that you have lost.

00:20.340 --> 00:23.259
Daniel Holden confessed
to killing Hanna.

00:23.260 --> 00:26.386
The sentence was vacated
on a DNA technicality.

00:26.387 --> 00:28.316
Now that I'm here in this world,

00:28.317 --> 00:30.181
I don't have figured out yet.

00:30.182 --> 00:32.238
It will be glorious, Daniel.

00:32.238 --> 00:34.417
Did you have feelings for him, Tawney.

00:35.703 --> 00:39.370
There are people around here, Mom,
that want to see Daniel dead.

00:43.272 --> 00:46.797
It's time to join the human race,
and all its privitations.

00:47.532 --> 00:49.701
And tell how we make this right, Daniel?

00:49.702 --> 00:51.702
How we exist as a family now?

00:52.109 --> 00:54.626
You're the most reluctant
innocent man I ever seen.

00:54.627 --> 00:56.911
Did you kill Hanna Dean?

00:56.912 --> 00:58.711
So Daniel just leave town now?

00:58.712 --> 01:00.241
As a convicted murderer.

01:00.242 --> 01:01.954
I wanna give it my best shot.

01:01.955 --> 01:03.255
I know you will.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.880
What's up, Dan?

04:06.097 --> 04:08.058
The order. It's done.

04:09.192 --> 04:10.277
Okay.

04:11.282 --> 04:13.195
Wow. Uh...

04:13.549 --> 04:15.335
It's not really time
to start a new order.

04:16.454 --> 04:18.975
Why don't you slip out
early? I'll clock you out.

04:22.208 --> 04:23.475
Is that a problem?

04:25.694 --> 04:29.044
Um, my bus doesn't get here
for another 45 minutes.

04:29.376 --> 04:30.231
Well...

04:31.547 --> 04:33.484
Go hang out in the break
room or somethin'.

04:35.034 --> 04:37.318
Maybe I could, uh, get my check, too,

04:37.319 --> 04:39.288
uh, while I'm here?

04:39.757 --> 04:41.109
You don't work for free?

04:42.348 --> 04:44.705
No, not working for free.

04:45.906 --> 04:47.229
Hell with that, right?

04:48.783 --> 04:50.076
Hell with that.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.002
Everything going well

04:58.624 --> 05:01.044
with, uh... everything?

05:02.331 --> 05:05.211
Grateful to have a job, you know.

05:06.090 --> 05:07.631
We're glad to have you, Dan.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.578
Really are.

05:10.619 --> 05:12.354
Well, I'm glad you're glad.

05:15.592 --> 05:16.961
See you tomorrow.

05:23.933 --> 05:25.545
What's up?

05:25.546 --> 05:27.307
I-I'm sorry. Uh...

05:27.837 --> 05:31.173
Should I come back now to
clock out or... or not?

05:31.685 --> 05:34.170
I got you covered, pal. No sweat.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.088
The most important
thing we can do here

05:46.089 --> 05:47.656
at the New Canaan Project...

05:47.657 --> 05:49.190
is to help you gain employment.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.694
And then keep that employment.

05:53.695 --> 05:56.622
Some of y'all might be
better at getting jobs,

05:57.317 --> 05:59.134
others at keepin' 'em.

05:59.135 --> 06:01.375
But if you can't do both out here...

06:01.837 --> 06:04.586
well, you know how that story ends.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.059
In the old days, you might
lie about your past,

06:08.777 --> 06:10.528
not that that was ever a good idea.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.457
Maybe it wouldn't catch up with you.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.400
That's not an option today. Why is that?

06:17.253 --> 06:19.289
Hmm? Why is lying a bad idea?

06:20.390 --> 06:22.108
- Yes, ma'am.
- Internet.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.226
Background checks. Much easier now.

06:25.227 --> 06:26.562
One click.

06:26.863 --> 06:29.597
If you did the time,
that they will find.

06:30.133 --> 06:33.000
- So what you gotta do?
- Tell the truth.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.319
Tell the truth.

06:36.739 --> 06:38.932
Have you ever been
convicted of a felony?

06:41.878 --> 06:45.558
Remember, Brittany, most
prospective employers

06:45.559 --> 06:47.545
are already gonna know
you're an ex-offender.

06:48.057 --> 06:50.084
It's just kind of shameful
to talk about it.

06:50.085 --> 06:51.905
Well, the more times
you tell your story,

06:51.906 --> 06:53.943
the easier it'll get, I promise.

06:53.944 --> 06:56.425
It's not about making you ashamed.

06:56.944 --> 06:57.822
Okay?

06:58.226 --> 06:59.566
Ready?

07:01.263 --> 07:02.926
Were you ever convicted of a felony?

07:03.474 --> 07:04.647
Yes, ma'am.

07:05.078 --> 07:08.069
I was incarcerated at the
Darbyville State Prison.

07:08.070 --> 07:09.806
And what were you in there for?

07:12.685 --> 07:13.874
Sorry to interrupt.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.234
Um, here's my pay stub.

07:17.502 --> 07:19.992
Dan, this is Brittany.

07:20.916 --> 07:23.250
- Hello, Brittany.
- Hello.

07:23.251 --> 07:25.233
Dan's one of our clients, too.

07:26.339 --> 07:29.086
How long you been out?

07:30.125 --> 07:31.455
Few months.

07:32.189 --> 07:33.463
I've only been out a week.

07:34.731 --> 07:36.398
Quite an adjustment, huh?

07:36.788 --> 07:38.319
I'll say.

07:38.888 --> 07:41.245
Dan's one of our many success stories.

07:41.849 --> 07:45.339
I-I'd call it more a-a work in progress.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.202
You wanna share how long you were in?

07:48.811 --> 07:51.312
Um, sure.

07:51.313 --> 07:53.447
A little over 19 years.

07:54.100 --> 07:54.853
Wow.

07:55.636 --> 07:57.431
I only did four.

07:57.432 --> 08:00.143
Four years is... is still a long time

08:00.757 --> 08:02.052
in one's life.

08:02.613 --> 08:05.847
The point is, by using our techniques,

08:05.848 --> 08:08.096
Dan was able to get a good-paying job.

08:08.791 --> 08:10.197
Took a while.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.800
Which is the norm.

08:11.801 --> 08:14.369
Most clients have to
interview multiple times

08:14.370 --> 08:15.903
before getting a job.

08:15.904 --> 08:17.035
Right, Dan?

08:18.595 --> 08:20.074
Well, that's... that's right, Maggie.

08:20.075 --> 08:23.813
Uh, which is why we... we treat each...

08:24.389 --> 08:27.606
job interview as a... as
an opportunity to learn

08:28.416 --> 08:32.852
rather than a-a positive or...
or... or a negative experience,

08:32.854 --> 08:34.923
based on the end result of that...

08:36.154 --> 08:37.994
e-experience.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.831
That's a smart way to think about it.

08:42.777 --> 08:45.928
Yeah, they... they kind of got
things figured out 'round here.

08:46.868 --> 08:48.509
You'll be in good hands.

08:53.922 --> 08:54.965
See you later.

09:05.053 --> 09:08.000
<i>Hey, Daniel. It's your mama.</i>

09:09.291 --> 09:11.125
<i>Not much to say today,</i>

09:11.126 --> 09:14.186
<i>other than everybody
misses you terribly.</i>

09:15.530 --> 09:18.228
<i>Let's see. Jared got a new bike.</i>

09:19.123 --> 09:21.232
<i>He isn't much interested in cars yet,</i>

09:22.003 --> 09:23.338
<i>which is good.</i>

09:23.339 --> 09:25.051
<i>Bikes are a lot cheaper.</i>

09:25.753 --> 09:27.881
<i>And your job sounds interesting, honey.</i>

09:28.428 --> 09:30.090
<i>You know, a good place to start.</i>

09:30.655 --> 09:31.673
<i>Proud of you.</i>

09:32.735 --> 09:34.583
<i>Anyway, call me again
if you get the chance.</i>

09:34.584 --> 09:37.174
<i>I-I promise to have the
phone near me next time.</i>

09:37.886 --> 09:39.443
<i>No pressure, though.</i>

09:40.088 --> 09:41.178
<i>We love you.</i>

10:01.510 --> 10:04.384
Don't see many dudes getting
letters on the outside.

10:05.678 --> 10:07.304
Everybody's texting.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.628
Y-yeah.

10:12.121 --> 10:15.152
Anyway, group's startin' in a few.

10:16.958 --> 10:17.979
Thanks.

10:27.470 --> 10:30.605
For me, keeping busy on the inside

10:30.606 --> 10:32.537
was a way to keep out of trouble.

10:33.171 --> 10:34.676
It's the same out here, really.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.644
Yeah, it's a good way
to look at it, Nate.

10:36.645 --> 10:38.480
Y'all got to keep busy,

10:38.481 --> 10:40.283
especially if you don't have a job yet.

10:42.779 --> 10:44.106
What's going on, Pickle?

10:44.688 --> 10:47.087
Oh, you know. Keepin' on, keepin' on.

10:47.512 --> 10:49.309
All right. Good, good.

10:51.341 --> 10:53.075
Uh, let... let's see.

10:53.996 --> 10:55.529
Went on another job interview today.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.698
Number 14, not that I'm countin'.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.701
Mm-hmm. How'd it go?

10:59.702 --> 11:02.202
Well, you know, they always
perk up when they hear

11:02.203 --> 11:04.538
I was in the laundry
business for 23 years,

11:04.539 --> 11:07.442
till they realize I was washing
nasty-ass convict clothes.

11:11.469 --> 11:13.548
Then you see that... fear, judgment,

11:13.549 --> 11:15.245
whatever come up in 'em.

11:15.650 --> 11:17.106
How do you respond to that?

11:17.961 --> 11:19.321
Do like y'all say.

11:19.322 --> 11:21.990
Turn the positive into a negative, uh,

11:21.991 --> 11:24.400
uh, negative into a positive.
You know what I'm sayin'.

11:24.986 --> 11:26.889
Tell 'em I learned from my mistakes,

11:27.370 --> 11:29.390
paid my debt to society.

11:29.391 --> 11:31.684
Be a good employee if
anybody give me a chance.

11:31.685 --> 11:34.034
You feel like you have a chance?

11:34.035 --> 11:37.103
A real chance to get a job
when they're interviewing you?

11:40.856 --> 11:44.195
I ain't had a job outside a
prison in 25 years, Avery.

11:46.037 --> 11:48.461
How I'm supposed to know what
a real chance feel like?

11:49.150 --> 11:51.661
Okay, that's honest. Hmm?

11:52.454 --> 11:55.389
That's all we want, fellas,
for y'all to be honest.

11:55.390 --> 11:57.463
Ain't no right or wrong, just honest.

11:57.943 --> 11:59.517
You're going to get a job, Pickle.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.763
Can't every employer out
here be a dumb-ass.

12:03.384 --> 12:04.702
'Preciate that, Nate.

12:07.816 --> 12:09.186
Jesse, you wanna share?

12:11.106 --> 12:12.673
Might just pass tonight.

12:13.162 --> 12:14.439
You sure now?

12:15.377 --> 12:16.745
Yeah, I'm sure.

12:16.746 --> 12:17.872
Okay.

12:18.481 --> 12:20.719
You got some family coming
in this weekend, right?

12:22.183 --> 12:25.720
My little girl's comin'.
My mom's bringing her.

12:26.089 --> 12:27.613
That's something to look forward to.

12:28.527 --> 12:29.572
Yes, sir.

12:30.058 --> 12:31.793
Always have something to look
forward to. Right, fellas?

12:31.794 --> 12:33.227
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right, sir.

12:33.228 --> 12:34.430
Right.

12:39.568 --> 12:41.016
Mr. Tyrus...

12:41.725 --> 12:44.456
how are things in the world
of mass communications?

12:47.112 --> 12:49.443
- Can I get real?
- Lord, Tyrus.

12:49.444 --> 12:51.346
This is the one place
you <i>better</i> get real.

12:51.347 --> 12:52.613
All y'all had.

12:53.281 --> 12:55.472
Get real now or forever hold your peace.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.354
Sometimes people say shit,

12:59.355 --> 13:02.090
- shit that in prison...
- Now hold on, hold on.

13:02.091 --> 13:03.524
People at your work say shit?

13:03.525 --> 13:06.160
Remarks and shit, like,
connotations or whatever.

13:06.859 --> 13:07.613
You know, like in prison,

13:07.614 --> 13:09.663
you knew when somebody
was disrespecting you.

13:10.030 --> 13:11.536
Out here, I don't know if they...

13:12.656 --> 13:14.269
messing with me or not.

13:14.270 --> 13:16.071
Maybe they <i>are</i> messing with you, Tyrus.

13:16.072 --> 13:18.472
But messing with you out here
ain't the same as inside.

13:18.473 --> 13:21.076
You can't just go bumping
titties with some homie

13:21.077 --> 13:22.744
'cause he looked at you sideways.

13:23.149 --> 13:25.245
It ain't all about respect
and disrespect, Tyrus,

13:25.246 --> 13:27.649
that's some... that's some
prison yard bullshit, man.

13:27.650 --> 13:29.031
That's right.

13:30.025 --> 13:31.227
I hear you.

13:32.069 --> 13:33.554
Just get twisted sometime.

13:33.555 --> 13:36.758
Who don't, man? That's...
that's... that's life.

13:36.759 --> 13:38.759
Things take time, too, Tyrus.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.427
Can't learn the straight life overnight

13:40.428 --> 13:42.723
just like we didn't learn
the convict life that way.

13:42.724 --> 13:45.133
- That's right.
- Damn, Tyrus.

13:45.134 --> 13:46.500
You might just learn something

13:46.501 --> 13:47.869
from the middle-aged white man, too.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.437
Radical.

13:55.810 --> 13:58.603
Dan? How are you this evening?

14:01.350 --> 14:03.072
Uh, things are good, sir.

14:04.035 --> 14:05.118
That's good.

14:05.648 --> 14:07.221
Good that things are good.

14:15.530 --> 14:16.709
I, um...

14:17.649 --> 14:23.297
it's, uh, I'm grateful to have
full-time employment now.

14:25.161 --> 14:27.111
I, uh, I got another paycheck today,

14:28.654 --> 14:31.814
uh, which is the point... I guess.

14:34.071 --> 14:36.030
U-um, went to the bank,

14:36.766 --> 14:39.924
came back to get ready for
group, and now I'm here.

14:44.559 --> 14:47.217
Yes, you are. Here.

14:48.230 --> 14:49.599
Thanks for sharing, Dan.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.336
All right, well, let's
close it out. Nate?

14:55.337 --> 14:59.611
Sure. God, grant me...

14:59.612 --> 15:02.844
the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

15:02.845 --> 15:05.480
the courage to change things I can't,

15:05.481 --> 15:07.815
and the wisdom to know the difference.

16:35.258 --> 16:37.523
Hey, Dan. We got a problem.

16:38.185 --> 16:39.095
Problem?

16:39.096 --> 16:40.786
With the big order last week.

16:41.961 --> 16:43.345
The one you filled.

16:44.735 --> 16:47.336
But I always recheck my orders.

16:47.337 --> 16:49.466
I don't know what happened.
I just know it was wrong.

16:50.006 --> 16:52.456
They're sending back the
whole order, on us.

16:53.443 --> 16:55.378
Well, y-you could cross-reference that

16:55.379 --> 16:59.048
and check whether it was
their error or ours.

16:59.049 --> 17:00.265
To what end?

17:01.452 --> 17:02.986
I-I'm sorry?

17:02.987 --> 17:05.454
Zyndeck is one of our biggest customers.

17:05.455 --> 17:07.222
They believe it's our mistake.

17:07.223 --> 17:09.501
It's not our job to convince
them otherwise, is it?

17:09.890 --> 17:11.131
Why not?

17:12.962 --> 17:14.630
It's our job to make it right.

17:14.631 --> 17:17.200
- But if it was their mistake...
- So here's what's gonna happen.

17:17.201 --> 17:20.403
Earl, you and Dan are gonna
refill the order ASAP.

17:20.404 --> 17:22.672
- Can't Cedric help him?
- Really, Earl?

17:22.673 --> 17:24.240
I don't care how long it takes.

17:24.241 --> 17:25.942
Just get it done by
tonight. Is that clear?

17:25.943 --> 17:27.212
Yes, sir.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.366
Supposed to go to that Jamey
Johnson show tonight.

17:43.459 --> 17:45.495
Nice work, dude.

17:45.496 --> 17:48.176
I-it wasn't my fault.

17:48.598 --> 17:50.161
You tell my girlfriend that?

17:53.136 --> 17:56.438
I-I think if we both, uh, pull orders

17:56.439 --> 17:59.942
and... and recheck them
against one list, it...

17:59.943 --> 18:03.111
Yeah, well, I've been doing
this a lot longer than you.

18:03.112 --> 18:04.713
And we'll pull them together

18:04.714 --> 18:07.684
so we don't screw it up
like the first time.

18:07.685 --> 18:08.914
Grab a ladder.

18:15.879 --> 18:17.081
There a problem?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.385
It's all good, dude.

18:37.967 --> 18:39.244
The transformer.

18:40.117 --> 18:42.651
They're telling us it's gonna be
at least an hour, maybe more.

18:44.841 --> 18:46.984
Can we go get some food off site?

18:47.831 --> 18:49.361
Yeah, that'd probably be all right.

18:50.990 --> 18:54.383
Just make sure you stay
close by. Take your phones.

18:56.048 --> 18:59.124
Let's go get some barbecue and beer.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.566
You wanna come with us?

19:06.598 --> 19:09.180
Uh... well...

19:11.500 --> 19:13.033
Ain't no big deal, man.

19:14.536 --> 19:16.778
Maybe I'll just go for a walk.

19:17.841 --> 19:19.307
Thank you, though.

19:19.922 --> 19:21.927
All right. Suit yourself.

20:42.592 --> 20:43.953
Can we help you?

20:46.328 --> 20:49.965
I-I just saw you with
the bird and was...

20:49.966 --> 20:50.798
Appalled?

20:52.936 --> 20:56.337
- Uh... more curious.
- Like, train wreck curious?

20:57.267 --> 21:00.110
I-if a train wreck is absurd.

21:01.244 --> 21:04.645
- W-what is this place?
- We're an artists' cooperative.

21:04.646 --> 21:06.448
Sometimes we're an
artists' dysfunctional,

21:06.449 --> 21:08.717
but, uh, mostly we're cooperative.

21:12.587 --> 21:15.356
Are you an artist?

21:15.696 --> 21:18.061
No, I-I'm a warehouseman.

21:22.065 --> 21:23.564
That's cool.

21:26.268 --> 21:30.237
Do you want to <i>be</i> an artist?

21:30.238 --> 21:32.531
Aren't you either an
artist or not an artist?

21:33.400 --> 21:35.410
How 'bout a patron of the arts?

21:35.411 --> 21:36.987
We prefer those, anyway.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.984
I don't think I have enough
money to qualify. I'm sorry.

21:41.985 --> 21:45.720
Or there are other ways.
You can donate your brawn.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.221
You are shameless.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.076
I know.

21:49.025 --> 21:52.093
We're putting on our annual
Art Walk... uh, Art Mingle...

21:52.094 --> 21:55.229
in a couple of weeks, and we
need help lifting and loading.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.631
Sound irresistible?

21:57.135 --> 22:00.101
It's sort of like being a
warehouseman for free.

22:01.595 --> 22:05.172
Sorta, but in a warehouse
that's trying to do something

22:05.173 --> 22:09.310
that's worth a shit...
something that matters.

22:09.311 --> 22:12.747
Or you could just, you
know, come to the show.

22:12.748 --> 22:13.991
Tell your friends.

22:15.218 --> 22:17.120
Sure, no problem.

22:27.872 --> 22:29.306
Uh, that's mine.

22:32.501 --> 22:34.133
You like shiny things?

22:35.451 --> 22:37.006
I like these.

22:38.207 --> 22:39.373
Why?

22:42.344 --> 22:45.212
Well, they're... they're mostly metal,

22:45.213 --> 22:48.140
but somehow still delicate.

22:50.318 --> 22:53.171
Make no inference towards their creator.

22:56.526 --> 22:57.802
None made.

23:06.602 --> 23:10.607
Civilization staves off
anarchy one more time.

23:12.952 --> 23:14.723
Aren't you kind of disappointed?

23:18.040 --> 23:19.406
I should go.

23:39.235 --> 23:41.280
Are you sure you don't wanna...

23:42.019 --> 23:43.503
create something?

23:44.473 --> 23:46.131
It's really powerful.

23:48.577 --> 23:51.229
Scary, isn't it?

24:00.155 --> 24:01.610
It's more than that.

24:03.377 --> 24:04.540
What do you mean?

24:12.267 --> 24:13.735
Everything okay, buddy?

24:17.739 --> 24:21.208
No, I-I-I should go.
Thank you for the tour.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.910
Hey, uh, what's your name?

24:23.671 --> 24:25.347
It's, um...

24:32.654 --> 24:35.524
It doesn't matter.

24:35.525 --> 24:37.240
Why doesn't it matter?

24:39.167 --> 24:40.340
This isn't real.

24:52.471 --> 24:53.467
Hey, Dan.

24:58.078 --> 24:59.914
Past curfew.

25:03.015 --> 25:06.640
I had to work late. Missed my bus.

25:08.521 --> 25:09.486
You call in?

25:10.839 --> 25:12.325
I don't think so.

25:14.027 --> 25:15.414
Jesse's gone.

25:16.429 --> 25:17.786
Is that right?

25:18.976 --> 25:21.099
Took a urine test
yesterday with his P.O.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.736
Came back dirty today.

25:23.837 --> 25:26.607
Guess that's why he left
sometime in the night.

25:31.110 --> 25:33.011
I'll be.

25:33.012 --> 25:34.266
Jesse talk to you?

25:34.880 --> 25:36.019
'Bout what?

25:37.073 --> 25:38.319
Anything.

25:42.489 --> 25:43.614
No.

25:56.117 --> 25:58.566
Y'all still thinking y'all
in prison or something?

25:59.673 --> 26:01.876
Now <i>I'm</i> The Man? Is
that what's happening?

26:03.844 --> 26:05.411
Any of y'all can leave right now.

26:05.412 --> 26:06.912
You don't have to fail a piss test.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.514
Just walk out that front
door, your own free will.

26:09.515 --> 26:11.016
Some of us gotta be here, Avery.

26:11.017 --> 26:12.095
Here?

26:12.096 --> 26:14.456
At a halfway house.
Terms of our probation.

26:15.454 --> 26:17.105
Well, then go somewhere else.

26:17.624 --> 26:20.126
If you don't like it here,
go to some other house.

26:20.127 --> 26:21.926
The Old Canaan House. Your mama's house.

26:21.927 --> 26:23.561
We won't stop you and
we won't report you.

26:23.562 --> 26:25.393
We not law enforcement.

26:25.947 --> 26:27.465
We know that, Avery.

26:27.466 --> 26:29.468
I'm not so sure about that "we," Nate.

26:29.469 --> 26:33.472
But I do know this... a
divided house will fall.

26:33.473 --> 26:35.741
A sick house <i>will</i> fall.

26:35.742 --> 26:37.143
And I'll clean out the
whole goddamn place

26:37.144 --> 26:38.468
'fore I let that happen.

26:38.469 --> 26:40.645
I'll move the good ones
to some other residence

26:40.646 --> 26:43.091
and let the rest of y'all
follow your bliss. You feel me?

26:46.807 --> 26:47.980
Yes, sir.

26:51.491 --> 26:53.077
Now I'm gonna go to <i>my</i> house.

26:54.027 --> 26:56.933
And whoever's here tomorrow,
I'll assume wants to be here.

27:09.708 --> 27:12.545
Y'all are acting like Dan
wouldn't rat Jesse out,

27:12.546 --> 27:14.046
that he was protecting
him from something.

27:14.047 --> 27:15.761
From... from what?

27:16.683 --> 27:17.657
From help?

27:18.652 --> 27:21.520
Truth is, I think Dan didn't even know

27:21.521 --> 27:23.301
a thing about Jesse <i>to</i> tell.

27:24.790 --> 27:26.066
Do you, Dan?

28:13.673 --> 28:15.641
What's going on, Dan?

28:15.642 --> 28:18.176
- Not much.
- Weren't you out there

28:18.177 --> 28:20.145
when Avery threatened to
kick us all out the house?

28:20.146 --> 28:22.080
I think I was, yes.

28:22.081 --> 28:23.648
Then why you in here reading a book

28:23.649 --> 28:24.984
like that didn't just happen?

28:27.887 --> 28:30.155
What do you want me to do?

28:30.156 --> 28:34.193
When you don't talk to people, Dan,

28:34.194 --> 28:35.895
let 'em get to know you,

28:35.896 --> 28:38.597
people start thinking you don't like 'em

28:38.598 --> 28:41.567
or that you think you're
better than they are.

28:41.568 --> 28:43.470
That's not what I think.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.059
Or that you're hiding something.

28:45.638 --> 28:48.604
People don't know what to
think. Just human nature.

28:49.604 --> 28:53.546
I'm just not comfortable
being around people.

28:53.547 --> 28:56.181
It... it's not personal to any of you.

28:56.182 --> 28:58.082
Then don't let the door hit
your ass on the way out.

28:58.083 --> 28:59.818
Hey, hey. Hold on now, Tyrus.

28:59.819 --> 29:02.837
Seriously. It comes down to
either you in or you out.

29:04.124 --> 29:04.952
Right?

29:08.294 --> 29:10.497
I guess I'm out then.

29:12.765 --> 29:14.266
Now hold on, hold on, hold on.

29:14.267 --> 29:17.947
Look, we're not trying to force you out.

29:18.444 --> 29:20.105
Trying to get this house in order

29:20.106 --> 29:21.909
'fore Avery take it in
his own hands, you know?

29:26.166 --> 29:28.079
You're a bright guy, Dan.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.229
Real bright.

29:29.230 --> 29:31.323
Everybody in this house recognizes that.

29:32.085 --> 29:34.019
But I'm gonna be honest with you.

29:34.020 --> 29:36.655
Jesse didn't need the
smartest guy in the room.

29:36.656 --> 29:38.357
He needed somebody who showed
a little interest in him,

29:38.358 --> 29:40.467
who cared about him some.

29:41.978 --> 29:44.029
You know, if he had
that guy for a roomie,

29:44.030 --> 29:46.000
who's to say he wouldn't still be here?

29:47.267 --> 29:48.878
Who's to say?

29:51.804 --> 29:53.964
We ain't trying to make
you the bad guy here.

29:56.009 --> 29:57.675
Now we all had a part in this.

29:57.676 --> 29:59.294
Ultimately, Jesse his own man.

30:01.047 --> 30:04.883
But whatever he needed and
didn't get in this house,

30:04.884 --> 30:08.087
that <i>is</i> on us, <i>all</i> of us.

30:09.026 --> 30:11.698
To some degree, we got to
be our brother's keeper.

30:12.358 --> 30:13.853
Am I right?

30:15.710 --> 30:17.798
Probably so.

30:19.366 --> 30:21.332
That's how places like this work.

30:21.333 --> 30:23.202
It's really the only way they <i>can</i> work.

30:26.906 --> 30:28.908
We just need you to be one of us.

30:32.912 --> 30:35.402
I may just not be up to the task.

30:35.781 --> 30:38.117
To help others or to
let others help you?

30:41.354 --> 30:44.692
Both. Neither.

30:45.925 --> 30:50.598
Well, that's something you'll
have to decide for yourself.

30:57.169 --> 30:58.705
Okay.

30:59.438 --> 31:01.207
We'll leave you be then.

31:55.236 --> 31:57.230
Wasn't sure you'd still be here, Dan.

31:58.145 --> 31:59.238
Have a seat.

32:07.637 --> 32:09.356
Hell is other people.

32:10.727 --> 32:12.107
I don't follow.

32:12.108 --> 32:15.615
It's a quote from a play
that I-I read in prison

32:16.218 --> 32:17.785
called "No Exit."

32:17.786 --> 32:20.389
Dan, you weren't into
escapist fare, were you?

32:21.823 --> 32:25.194
The three characters in
the play were in hell.

32:25.195 --> 32:29.598
Forced to be together, just be together,

32:29.599 --> 32:31.515
in a room for eternity.

32:32.435 --> 32:34.471
And that was their hell.

32:35.938 --> 32:38.740
Well...

32:38.741 --> 32:42.871
Like I said last night, Dan,
you don't have to be here.

32:44.657 --> 32:46.328
Certainly not for eternity.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.231
That's the problem.

32:50.285 --> 32:54.690
I'm not sure I can be out
there either in the world.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.198
Now that sounds like hell.

32:59.344 --> 33:03.397
Those other guys in the
house, Nate, Pickle, Tyrus,

33:03.398 --> 33:04.899
when they were in prison,

33:04.900 --> 33:07.668
they were usually around a
lot of other guys, right?

33:08.362 --> 33:09.449
Interacting.

33:10.315 --> 33:11.562
Sounds like prison.

33:12.222 --> 33:15.676
I was alone, interacting with myself.

33:15.677 --> 33:17.378
I'm aware of that.

33:17.379 --> 33:19.515
Or the voices inside the grate.

33:20.850 --> 33:22.586
Voices?

33:28.523 --> 33:30.686
The other inmates on the row.

33:31.393 --> 33:35.398
We would communicate with each
other through the grates.

33:36.632 --> 33:38.127
I see.

33:40.266 --> 33:42.638
Sometimes with friends,

33:42.639 --> 33:46.608
sometimes with... no friends at all.

33:46.609 --> 33:48.409
But no matter who it was,

33:48.410 --> 33:51.445
I would never get to
see them or feel them,

33:51.446 --> 33:53.339
their... their presence.

33:54.716 --> 33:56.618
And that's not the same.

33:56.619 --> 33:59.353
No. No, it's not.

33:59.808 --> 34:00.811
And I did that.

34:01.357 --> 34:03.394
I lived like that for 20 years.

34:03.989 --> 34:05.100
That's a long time.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.337
It's a strange way to exist.

34:11.362 --> 34:12.636
It's inhuman.

34:16.472 --> 34:17.840
What is it, Dan?

34:23.745 --> 34:25.255
If not now, when?

34:32.359 --> 34:34.485
After my friend was executed,

34:34.956 --> 34:36.645
I became despondent...

34:37.458 --> 34:38.969
more despondent.

34:40.043 --> 34:42.659
I guess depressed. Enraged.

34:44.385 --> 34:46.485
But more than anything, I was lonely.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.672
So deeply lonely.

34:52.774 --> 34:57.254
He had protected me from
that more than I realized.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.172
I bet.

34:59.614 --> 35:03.433
When you are alone with
yourself all the time,

35:04.520 --> 35:06.420
with no one but yourself,

35:06.421 --> 35:09.825
you begin to go deeper
and deeper into yourself

35:09.826 --> 35:13.115
until... you lose yourself.

35:13.595 --> 35:15.588
It's a perverse contradiction.

35:18.582 --> 35:21.370
It's like your ego
begins to disintegrate

35:21.371 --> 35:25.073
until you... have no ego.

35:25.074 --> 35:28.943
Not in the sense that you...
you become humble or...

35:28.944 --> 35:33.782
or... or gain some kind of perspective,

35:33.783 --> 35:37.982
but that you literally
lose your sense of self.

35:40.690 --> 35:43.591
And I'm not sure anyone, unless
they have gone through it,

35:43.592 --> 35:46.026
can... can... can truly
understand how...

35:47.763 --> 35:50.040
profound that loss is.

35:53.069 --> 35:54.936
It's like the psychic glue

35:54.937 --> 36:00.202
that binds your whole notion
of existence is gone,

36:01.058 --> 36:03.773
and you become unglued.

36:04.647 --> 36:07.182
I think, therefore I am.

36:07.183 --> 36:09.684
I think too much, therefore I am not.

36:09.685 --> 36:11.586
I am not, therefore I am nothing.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.555
I am nothing, therefore I am dead.

36:13.556 --> 36:18.829
And if I am dead, then why am
I still so goddamn lonely?

36:24.467 --> 36:26.328
It's good that you're
talking about this, Dan.

36:30.286 --> 36:32.301
What you've been through
and what you've lost...

36:33.110 --> 36:35.276
Part of the grieving process, you know?

36:37.045 --> 36:39.536
Is there a 90-day plan for that, too?

36:40.273 --> 36:43.718
A New Canaan House grief plan?

36:43.719 --> 36:45.986
What color binder is that housed in?

36:45.987 --> 36:47.248
Ain't no plan for that.

36:48.491 --> 36:51.156
But we're here to help
you. We really are.

36:51.987 --> 36:54.995
The problem with your
program is I don't fit.

36:54.996 --> 36:56.932
You're a human being, Dan. You fit.

36:56.933 --> 36:58.800
One of your biggest tenets or dictums

36:58.801 --> 37:01.570
or whatever you call it is...
is to be upfront, yeah?

37:01.571 --> 37:03.389
Be straight, be real.

37:03.390 --> 37:05.073
Tell the world what you did, right?

37:05.074 --> 37:08.175
No, not tell the world,
just who you need to.

37:08.176 --> 37:10.778
The tiny little issue
I am having, Avery,

37:10.779 --> 37:14.356
is that I don't know what real is.

37:15.951 --> 37:19.071
I don't truly know what
I did or didn't do.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.301
I can say I am a convicted murderer,

37:24.056 --> 37:25.128
which is true.

37:25.767 --> 37:27.071
I am convicted.

37:27.529 --> 37:30.931
And I can say that I killed
her, too... Hanna...

37:31.734 --> 37:34.102
which I have said more than once.

37:36.099 --> 37:39.106
And I can even imagine
that I killed her,

37:39.107 --> 37:42.034
which I have imagined,

37:42.777 --> 37:47.697
because that's what I've been
asked to do multiple times.

37:48.494 --> 37:50.629
But I honestly can't say

37:50.630 --> 37:54.518
that I did, in fact, kill her.

37:58.505 --> 38:00.287
Because I just don't remember,

38:02.549 --> 38:03.883
for the life of me.

38:07.487 --> 38:09.071
And that's...

38:10.503 --> 38:11.814
Your truth.

38:14.576 --> 38:15.526
Yes.

38:18.979 --> 38:20.290
That's my truth.

38:25.922 --> 38:28.058
And what if you never
know what happened?

38:30.366 --> 38:31.748
I don't know.

38:33.029 --> 38:35.680
And I don't know what to
do with that unknowing.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.623
Sounds like you got to accept it.

38:38.090 --> 38:39.521
What else can you do?

38:40.603 --> 38:41.937
It's not so easy.

38:41.938 --> 38:43.177
Of course it isn't, but...

38:43.772 --> 38:45.304
you never tried, have you?

38:46.335 --> 38:47.091
No.

38:47.630 --> 38:49.311
- Why not?
- I don't know.

38:49.312 --> 38:52.113
Come on. You know why not.

38:52.114 --> 38:54.224
Because I don't feel like I deserve it.

38:54.225 --> 38:56.117
I-is that the answer you wanna hear?

38:56.118 --> 38:58.688
Deserve what? A life?

39:03.996 --> 39:05.934
I didn't think it would end this way.

39:06.444 --> 39:08.098
That you'd get out?

39:12.248 --> 39:13.357
Alive.

39:16.589 --> 39:17.505
No.

39:17.923 --> 39:20.008
Then that's what you've got to decide,

39:20.009 --> 39:23.713
whether you deserve a
life or not, out here,

39:24.445 --> 39:25.808
after all you've been through.

39:26.426 --> 39:29.818
After all that punishment,
after all that suffering,

39:29.819 --> 39:31.073
your one life.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.263
Do you deserve to live it?

39:34.824 --> 39:38.359
And just because you don't
remember or know for sure

39:38.360 --> 39:40.762
whether you killed that girl or not,

39:40.763 --> 39:42.311
that doesn't mean you did it either.

39:43.263 --> 39:44.333
Right?

39:47.770 --> 39:50.007
Maybe you oughta lean
the other way for a while,

39:51.239 --> 39:52.780
that you didn't do it.

39:55.911 --> 39:58.879
But if I lean that
way, it... it means...

39:58.880 --> 39:59.704
Means what?

40:02.520 --> 40:04.653
That I'm just making a decision.

40:04.654 --> 40:05.627
Okay.

40:06.154 --> 40:09.122
What else can you do?
Not make a decision?

40:10.025 --> 40:11.658
And isn't that the same thing?

40:12.367 --> 40:16.366
And didn't you already make
a decision the other way?

40:19.835 --> 40:22.420
This may sound hokey as shit, but...

40:23.226 --> 40:25.720
you gotta figure out some
way to love yourself.

40:41.492 --> 40:42.376
Hello.

40:43.619 --> 40:44.572
Hello.

40:49.188 --> 40:51.078
I-I'm sorry about yesterday.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.367
I'm... I'm not always like that.

40:56.131 --> 40:58.819
We're emotional beings. It happens.

41:00.690 --> 41:03.726
I-I don't know if you still
need help with things.

41:03.727 --> 41:07.785
Uh, or if it's too late,
which I understand.

41:08.144 --> 41:09.504
It's never too late.

41:16.573 --> 41:18.080
I'm, uh...

41:21.645 --> 41:23.109
I was in prison

41:23.747 --> 41:26.750
for a, you know,

41:26.751 --> 41:28.693
a pretty long time, actually.

41:29.673 --> 41:30.845
And I, uh,

41:31.455 --> 41:35.224
I haven't been out very
long, really, you know,

41:35.225 --> 41:37.156
in... in the context of time.

41:38.430 --> 41:41.906
And I-I don't know many people out here.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.040
I just needed to state that, I guess.

41:55.814 --> 41:59.183
Well...

41:59.184 --> 42:00.784
I was in a sorority once

42:00.785 --> 42:02.830
and I don't feel too good about that,

42:03.754 --> 42:05.746
but... here we are.

42:09.727 --> 42:10.996
I'm Daniel.

42:12.296 --> 42:13.277
My name.

42:14.298 --> 42:16.772
Hello, Daniel. I'm Chloe.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.673
Well, that didn't help.

42:23.674 --> 42:26.443
Which means it did.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.161
Playing Tonk.

42:44.595 --> 42:45.773
Is that right?

42:47.046 --> 42:49.172
- No, you di'int.
- Yes, I did.

42:54.372 --> 42:55.668
You ever play Tonk, Dan?

42:56.591 --> 42:58.629
No. Never.

42:59.296 --> 43:00.318
That's cool.

43:00.711 --> 43:02.545
Boom!

43:02.546 --> 43:04.748
Oh, man.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.036
Looks saucy.

43:06.651 --> 43:08.184
Get that way sometimes.

43:08.185 --> 43:09.323
You need to save some of that luck

43:09.324 --> 43:10.583
for your job hunt, dill Pickle.

43:10.584 --> 43:12.889
Oh. Oh. Okay.

43:12.890 --> 43:15.800
You funny.

43:21.540 --> 43:22.771
You wanna play, Dan?

43:25.169 --> 43:26.769
Maybe I'll just watch.

43:27.794 --> 43:28.771
Okay.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.825
Well, that ain't no fun.

43:37.714 --> 43:40.285
Come on, get on in here.
We'll walk you through it.

43:45.856 --> 43:48.726
Okay. Sure.

43:51.696 --> 43:53.253
Can't be too hard.

43:53.254 --> 43:55.220
Otherwise, Tyrus wouldn't be playing.

43:55.221 --> 43:56.756
You gonna be like that, old man?

43:56.757 --> 43:59.123
- Just telling the truth.
- Here we go.

43:59.124 --> 44:00.991
I'm gonna deal out five
cards to each of us.

44:00.992 --> 44:02.151
Okay.

44:02.152 --> 44:03.041
Draw.

44:04.594 --> 44:06.530
You ever play any kind of cards, Dan?

44:09.056 --> 44:10.606
A-a long time ago.

44:12.769 --> 44:14.703
My sister and I would... would...

44:14.704 --> 44:16.477
would play with my father.

44:18.041 --> 44:19.405
Oh, that's cool.

44:20.837 --> 44:22.298
What kind of game you play?

44:23.314 --> 44:26.973
It was Rummy. We... we played Rummy.

44:29.419 --> 44:32.429
Well, shoot. You'll pick
this up in no time.

44:32.923 --> 44:34.591
Sure, it's a lot like Rummy.

44:34.592 --> 44:36.274
I'll tell you what, let's
play an open hand.

44:36.275 --> 44:39.518
- Slam down. We'll explain it.
- Okay.

44:39.857 --> 44:41.947
So all these face cards,
they're worth 10.
