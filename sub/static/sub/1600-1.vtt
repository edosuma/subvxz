Mom?

01:02.650 --> 01:05.652
Dad?

01:08.757 --> 01:10.758
Mom!

01:14.196 --> 01:16.764
Mom?

01:16.832 --> 01:20.144
Mom!
Mom, open the door!

01:21.665 --> 01:23.566
Mom!

01:23.667 --> 01:25.535
What is it, Norman?

01:25.602 --> 01:29.505
It's dad.
He's--hurry!

01:39.650 --> 01:43.085
Dad? Dad? Dad?

01:43.153 --> 01:45.154
Dad...

01:52.296 --> 01:53.229
Norman...

02:00.571 --> 02:02.538
Norman?

02:05.142 --> 02:08.144
Norman.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.323
Oh, honey.
I'm so sorry.

02:21.592 --> 02:23.659
Dad.

02:52.956 --> 02:54.957
This is the part where you say,

02:55.058 --> 02:59.462
"Mother, this is beautiful.

02:59.529 --> 03:02.798
"I am so happy
we're moving here.

03:02.900 --> 03:07.603
You are so smart
to have thought of this."

03:07.704 --> 03:10.339
Mother, this is so beautiful.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.808
I'm so happy
you're making me move here.

03:12.876 --> 03:14.477
You're so smart

03:14.544 --> 03:19.282
to force me to do things
I have no say in.

03:19.349 --> 03:22.351
You're an ass.

03:26.957 --> 03:30.660
Okay, no peeking!

03:30.727 --> 03:33.329
Keep 'em closed.

03:33.430 --> 03:36.999
Okay.
Okay, not yet.

03:49.613 --> 03:53.049
Open your eyes.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.151
What do you think?

04:00.824 --> 04:04.393
This is crazy, mom.

04:04.461 --> 04:08.030
It's not crazy.
It's not.

04:08.098 --> 04:10.232
We're gonna run this place.
Mm-hmm.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.035
Yeah.

04:13.103 --> 04:16.172
We own a motel, Norman Bates.

04:18.141 --> 04:22.077
Come on.
I wanna show you the house.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.680
I bought the whole thing,

04:24.781 --> 04:27.783
the house and the motel,
on a foreclosure.

04:36.159 --> 04:37.360
And everything came with it.

04:37.461 --> 04:38.794
Awesome.

04:38.895 --> 04:40.129
You can't buy furniture
like this anymore.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.464
You have to imagine this room

04:41.565 --> 04:43.733
without all this crap in it.

04:43.834 --> 04:46.135
Just simple,
elegant furnishings,

04:46.203 --> 04:48.204
open space, light.

04:48.271 --> 04:51.941
Linen drapes, fresh peonies.

04:52.009 --> 04:55.644
This space is beautiful.

04:57.447 --> 05:00.983
Come on.
I want to show you upstairs.

05:04.354 --> 05:06.589
What's up here?
My room?

05:06.656 --> 05:09.658
No, I put you down here,
closer to me.

05:12.095 --> 05:15.831
This...is your room.

05:22.072 --> 05:26.008
And this...
is my room.

05:33.450 --> 05:35.251
Norman,
we've been through a lot.

05:35.352 --> 05:37.186
This is our chance
to start over.

05:37.287 --> 05:40.189
Maybe some people
don't get to start over.

05:40.290 --> 05:42.358
Maybe they just bring themselves
to a new place.

05:42.459 --> 05:44.760
They do get to start over,

05:44.828 --> 05:47.463
but they have to try.

05:47.564 --> 05:51.133
Yeah?
Norman, please, for me.

05:51.201 --> 05:54.737
It's all gonna be good.
You'll see.

07:06.368 --> 07:08.425
You're new.
What's your name?

07:08.630 --> 07:09.715
Norman Bates.

07:09.835 --> 07:11.205
When did you move here,
Norman Bates?

07:11.273 --> 07:12.774
Last night.

07:12.841 --> 07:14.876
Where?
What house?

07:14.977 --> 07:16.644
Oh, here.
The house at the motel.

07:16.745 --> 07:18.479
Oh, so you bought the motel?

07:18.547 --> 07:19.781
Are you actually
gonna live here,

07:19.848 --> 07:21.482
or are you just flipping
the property?

07:21.550 --> 07:23.818
- We're not flipping.
- Do you have any brothers?

07:23.919 --> 07:26.220
An older brother.
But he doesn't live here.

07:26.288 --> 07:29.457
- Just me and my mom.
- You have a girlfriend?

07:29.558 --> 07:31.192
No.

07:31.293 --> 07:33.728

- Come on.

07:39.635 --> 07:41.035
Come with us. Come on.

07:47.810 --> 07:48.977
Am I too heavy?

You have any questions
at school, you call me.

08:09.131 --> 08:12.133
- Okay?
- Thanks.

08:37.025 --> 08:39.559
Hello, Dylan.

08:39.662 --> 08:43.030
Thanks for letting me know
you moved, mom.

08:43.131 --> 08:46.067
Well, I'm pretty sure
the last time we spoke,

08:46.135 --> 08:48.102
you told me
to "drop dead, bitch."

08:48.203 --> 08:49.937
Sorry I took it personally.

08:50.039 --> 08:51.372
What, so you thought
that it was okay

08:51.473 --> 08:55.710
not to tell your own son
that you moved?

08:55.778 --> 08:58.746
What if I was hurt?
What if I was in the hospital?

08:58.847 --> 09:00.948
What if I needed you?

09:01.050 --> 09:03.718
Are you hurt?
Are you in a hospital?

09:03.786 --> 09:07.321
I need some money.
My job fell apart.

09:07.423 --> 09:11.759
Hello? Norma?
Hello?

09:11.860 --> 09:14.796
So I want you to just think
about poetry tonight.

09:14.863 --> 09:17.598
I mean, what does it mean?
Why is it timeless?

09:17.700 --> 09:20.001
Why is there power in words

09:20.102 --> 09:22.737
arranged in cadences
and structures?

09:22.838 --> 09:26.841
Be ready to talk tomorrow.

09:26.942 --> 09:30.445
Norman, can I talk to you
for a minute?

09:30.512 --> 09:31.846
Sure.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.614
I'm gonna be your advisor here,

09:33.682 --> 09:36.584
and I was just reviewing
your school records and, um...

09:36.685 --> 09:39.353
Your test scores are...

09:39.421 --> 09:41.689
really impressive.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.958
But your grades
just don't match up with them.

09:44.059 --> 09:45.860
That's a shame.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.029
Why do you think that is,
Norman?

09:48.130 --> 09:50.164
- We move a lot.
- Mm-hmm, yeah, I see that.

09:50.232 --> 09:52.333
You've been
to five different schools.

09:52.434 --> 09:53.935
Is everything okay at home?

09:54.036 --> 09:56.938
Yeah, yeah.

09:57.039 --> 10:00.341
My mom's just a little...
impulsive.

10:00.409 --> 10:01.776
She gets these ideas
about things,

10:01.877 --> 10:05.379
and--and then we move
and start over...

10:05.481 --> 10:07.749
- which is good.
- Mm.

10:20.395 --> 10:21.729
You know, I think
it might be a good idea,

10:21.797 --> 10:22.964
now that you're here,

10:23.065 --> 10:25.166
to try to put down some roots.

10:25.234 --> 10:27.802
You know, get involved,
maybe join a sports team?

10:27.870 --> 10:29.871
I don't really play any sports.

10:29.972 --> 10:31.405
My mom never really liked them.

10:31.507 --> 10:35.143
Hmm.
What about track?

10:36.879 --> 10:39.714
You look like a runner.

10:39.782 --> 10:43.084
- You ever do any running?
- Not as a sport, no.

10:43.152 --> 10:45.253
Well, track team tryouts
are today.

10:45.354 --> 10:48.156
Why don't you go talk
to coach carpenter after school?

10:48.257 --> 10:51.826
I'll--I'll tell him
that you're coming down.

10:51.894 --> 10:54.662
Okay.

10:54.763 --> 10:57.665
Norman, I...

10:57.766 --> 10:59.934
I see that you
lost your dad recently.

11:00.002 --> 11:02.170
I know how hard that must be.

11:02.237 --> 11:04.906
So please know
that you can come to me

11:04.973 --> 11:09.043
if you have any issues
or questions about anything,

11:09.144 --> 11:12.980
because I'm here for you.
Okay?

11:14.550 --> 11:17.185
I have to go now.

11:30.799 --> 11:33.367
Wow.
Dinner smells great, mom.

11:46.181 --> 11:49.150
I've been--
I've been waiting for you.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.619
I stayed after school
to try out for the track team.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.120
Oh, the track team?

11:53.188 --> 11:55.890
Yeah, well, it was
Miss Watson's idea, I...

11:55.991 --> 11:57.091
Who's Miss Watson?

11:57.192 --> 11:59.460
My language arts teacher.

11:59.561 --> 12:01.796
But yeah, she thought
it'd be a good idea

12:01.897 --> 12:05.132
for me to get involved
at school.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.568
That it'd be good for me.

12:07.636 --> 12:11.639
I need you to sign this parent's
permission slip, though.

12:18.180 --> 12:20.081
Honey, this is, like,
every day after school,

12:20.182 --> 12:22.250
and track meets on Saturdays?

12:22.351 --> 12:25.019
We just bought a motel.

12:25.087 --> 12:26.854
I mean, how do you
expect me to get it

12:26.922 --> 12:28.522
up and running
without your help?

12:28.624 --> 12:31.525
I mean, you're putting me
in a tough spot here.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.261
Mom, it's okay.
I don't have to do it.

12:33.362 --> 12:35.162
No, I'm not gonna be

12:35.264 --> 12:39.834
the mother who tells her kid
he can't be on the track team.

12:39.935 --> 12:41.535
It's fine.
It's okay.

12:41.637 --> 12:46.040
I'll just do everything myself,
the way I always do.

12:46.108 --> 12:48.709
Mom, come on, sit down.
Let's eat dinner.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.546
You know, Norman,
I just spent all day...

12:52.648 --> 12:55.016
doing all of this.

12:55.117 --> 12:57.385
You know, I just--

13:05.560 --> 13:08.562
Never mind, I'm not hungry.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.667
It's fine.

13:12.734 --> 13:15.403
You know, it doesn't matter.

13:15.470 --> 13:19.473
I have to get some groceries.
Just eat your dinner.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.744
Mother!

13:33.221 --> 13:36.390
- Norman Bates?
- Yes.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.978
Just moved in
a couple of nights ago.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.593
How do you like it?

13:39.661 --> 13:41.147
Yeah, it's fine so far.

13:41.267 --> 13:42.997
You live here with your mom?

13:43.098 --> 13:45.666
Yeah.
Yeah, do you know her?

13:45.767 --> 13:49.103
I know--
I know about her.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.772
- Do you want me to get her?
- You're 17.

13:51.840 --> 13:54.008
You're from Arizona,
and your father died.

13:54.109 --> 13:57.912
- Yeah, let me get my mom.
- It's just the two of you.

13:58.013 --> 14:00.681
What do you know about
running a motel, anything?

14:00.749 --> 14:02.350
'Cause you look like
a little kid to me.

14:02.451 --> 14:03.718
I don't think you could run
much of nothing.

14:03.819 --> 14:06.387
Can I help you with something?

14:06.488 --> 14:07.849
I think it's you
that needs help.

14:07.856 --> 14:10.925
Really?
How might that be?

14:11.026 --> 14:14.595
I'm Keith Summers.

14:16.865 --> 14:18.032
Summers!

14:18.133 --> 14:20.968
This is my family's property.

14:21.036 --> 14:24.138
My great-great-grandfather
built this house in 1912,

14:24.206 --> 14:27.441
and my grandfather
built that motel in the '50s.

14:27.509 --> 14:30.544
And that's
my grandmother's rug!

14:30.645 --> 14:34.215
This property has been in
my family for over a century.

14:39.588 --> 14:43.324
I'm sure it was very hard
for you to lose it to the bank,

14:43.392 --> 14:47.328
and I'm very sorry, but, uh...

14:48.864 --> 14:50.664
well, it is ours now.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.501
I know everything
about this place.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.102
Every nook and cranny.

14:55.203 --> 14:57.104
Every dirty secret.

14:57.205 --> 14:59.640
You don't know
how this place works.

14:59.741 --> 15:00.941
This town?

15:01.043 --> 15:03.411
You know nothing
about this town.

15:03.512 --> 15:06.280
What makes you think you
can run this place by yourself?

15:06.381 --> 15:09.383
Because I can.

15:11.420 --> 15:14.188
Now get the hell off
my property.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.024
And if I ever see you here again
I will call the police,

15:17.125 --> 15:20.594
or I will shoot you myself.

15:20.695 --> 15:22.263
You're gonna call the police?

15:22.330 --> 15:26.100
- Get in, get in!
- Go ahead, call the police.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.135
I go fishing with half of 'em.

15:28.236 --> 15:30.871
I grew up here.
This is my house!

15:30.972 --> 15:32.840
So you're gonna
call the cops on me?

15:32.941 --> 15:36.944
Well go ahead!
Go ahead, call 'em!

15:40.148 --> 15:44.151
Do you think you should've
said all that stuff to him?

15:46.388 --> 15:49.557
He's just some pathetic,
drunk loser slob, honey.

15:49.624 --> 15:51.792
He's--he's not gonna
bother us anymore.

16:50.952 --> 16:52.553
Oh, we're friends
with Norman from school

16:52.621 --> 16:54.355
and we're going to the library,

16:54.456 --> 16:57.691
and we were wondering if he
wanted to come study with us.

16:57.792 --> 17:00.461
- Hey.
- Hey, Norman.

17:03.798 --> 17:05.232
I'm sure he would love to go,

17:05.333 --> 17:07.468
but we're in the middle
of a lot of stuff.

17:07.536 --> 17:11.271
We still have unpacking to do.

17:11.339 --> 17:14.708
I totally understand.

17:14.809 --> 17:17.278
I like your house.
It's so cool.

17:17.345 --> 17:19.547
Thank you.
There's--

17:19.614 --> 17:21.882
We got a lot of work to do,
but it's--it's got potential.

17:21.983 --> 17:23.651
- Well, maybe I could--
- No, Norman, not tonight.

17:23.718 --> 17:25.819
No, it's not a good idea, no.
Another time.

17:25.921 --> 17:27.253
No worries.

17:27.355 --> 17:28.889
It was really nice meeting you,
Mrs. Bates.

17:28.990 --> 17:31.725
Nice to meet you too.
Thanks for stopping by.

17:31.826 --> 17:33.761
- Nice to meet you.
- Good night, Norman.

17:33.828 --> 17:36.830
- See you, Norman.
- See ya.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.900
How could you do that?

17:40.001 --> 17:41.569
You didn't even let me answer.

17:41.636 --> 17:42.937
Well, there was no point
in answering

17:43.004 --> 17:44.638
because I knew
you would say "Yes,"

17:44.739 --> 17:47.241
and I knew that
I would have to say "No."

17:47.342 --> 17:48.909
I could have gone, mom.

17:49.010 --> 17:51.912
You can go another time,
when we're settled in.

17:52.013 --> 17:53.973
This is what it's always
gonna be like with you.

17:54.015 --> 17:55.950
"Later."
"Another time."

17:56.017 --> 17:57.451
When, mom?

17:57.552 --> 17:58.786
You said you wanted me
to have a life here--

17:58.887 --> 18:00.454
this is how you have one!

18:00.555 --> 18:02.089
You meet friends, you let
other people in your life!

18:02.190 --> 18:03.691
- Friends?
- Yeah, she's pretty.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.093
Maybe she kind of likes me.
I'm 17!

18:06.194 --> 18:07.361
Norman,
you don't even know them!

18:07.462 --> 18:08.702
You have to be
a little careful.

18:08.730 --> 18:10.130
Why do I have to be careful?

18:10.198 --> 18:11.865
Norman, don't lose
your temper with me!

18:11.933 --> 18:15.102
I'm just looking out for you.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.512
Well, maybe you better
just stay there

18:25.614 --> 18:28.616
the rest of the night then!

18:40.629 --> 18:43.030
I suck.

19:30.414 --> 19:33.013
Oh, my God, you're so cute.

19:33.133 --> 19:35.129
You actually thought
we were gonna go study.

There's a lot to look at.

20:55.799 --> 20:58.334
Is that a line?

20:58.435 --> 21:00.403
You don't seem like
a guy who would have lines.

21:00.471 --> 21:02.805
No, I've--
I mean, really.

21:02.906 --> 21:06.409
There's a lot to look at.

21:06.477 --> 21:07.910
It wasn't a line.

21:08.011 --> 21:10.913
You're different, aren't you?

21:11.014 --> 21:14.383
I don't know, maybe.

21:14.485 --> 21:16.185
I think people who are different
don't know they're different

21:16.286 --> 21:19.288
'cause they have nothing
to compare it to.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.725
Yeah.
You're different.

21:22.826 --> 21:25.928
- What's so different about me?
- I don't know, it's just...

21:26.029 --> 21:30.099
a feeling I get.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.568
You're like...

21:32.669 --> 21:36.572
a beautiful, deep, still lake

21:36.673 --> 21:40.009
in the middle
of a concrete world.

21:40.110 --> 21:42.912
I am?
That's...kind of weird.

21:43.013 --> 21:46.282
You're kind of weird.

21:46.383 --> 21:48.684
Weird good.

21:51.221 --> 21:53.289
Hey, Brad, you know who's
doing the recycling around here?

21:53.390 --> 21:55.124
Oh, hey, Richard.

21:55.225 --> 21:58.761
You get your diorama finished?

21:58.862 --> 22:00.863
Richard had to do a diorama
for the globe theater

22:00.931 --> 22:02.598
for his drama lit class.

22:02.666 --> 22:04.967
I mean, seriously,
what grade are we in?

22:05.035 --> 22:07.570
Yeah, I got it done,
and it actually kills.

22:07.671 --> 22:11.574
Richard, this is Norman.

22:11.675 --> 22:13.409
- He's new at our school.
- Hey.

22:13.477 --> 22:16.445
Hey.

22:16.547 --> 22:19.749
Babe, Jones just got here.
Let's go say hi, all right?

22:19.850 --> 22:22.585
Okay.
You wanna come?

22:22.686 --> 22:24.253
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm--I'm good.

22:24.321 --> 22:27.790
You sure?

22:29.760 --> 22:32.795

24:01.618 --> 24:04.420
No!

24:08.792 --> 24:11.160
Norman!

24:16.800 --> 24:19.168
Norman!
Aah!

24:38.789 --> 24:41.724
Ow! Ow!

24:41.792 --> 24:43.359
Norman!

24:43.427 --> 24:45.761
Norman!

24:45.862 --> 24:49.799
Norman!

25:03.146 --> 25:05.815
This house...

25:05.882 --> 25:07.750
This house is mine.

25:07.818 --> 25:10.986
And everything
in this house is mine.

25:20.530 --> 25:23.332
Norman!

25:28.004 --> 25:31.674
Norman! No!

25:35.178 --> 25:38.614
Norman!

25:58.268 --> 26:00.336
Norman!

26:00.437 --> 26:02.538
Mom?

26:04.474 --> 26:07.143
Norman, the handcuffs.
See if he has a key.

26:22.092 --> 26:24.160
Hurry, hurry!

26:24.261 --> 26:28.731
Give it to me.
Give it to me, give it to me!

26:36.006 --> 26:39.809
- Ow!
- Mom, your hand.

26:39.910 --> 26:42.178
Get the emergency kit.
It's in the bathroom cabinet.

26:42.279 --> 26:44.647
Yeah.

27:20.851 --> 27:23.285
You liked it.

27:46.009 --> 27:48.210
Mother!

27:58.655 --> 28:00.456
We have to call 911.

28:00.557 --> 28:02.491
No!
No.

28:02.592 --> 28:04.159
We're not calling 911.
Not doing it.

28:04.227 --> 28:07.496
Mom, he attacked you.
It was self-defense.

28:12.669 --> 28:14.803
It was self-defense,
wasn't it?

28:14.871 --> 28:19.241
Norman, no matter what,
this will become public.

28:19.309 --> 28:21.777
And it'll be in all the papers.

28:21.845 --> 28:23.345
Everyone in town
will know about it.

28:23.413 --> 28:27.316
Who is gonna book a room
in the rape/murder motel?

28:27.417 --> 28:30.185
It will ruin us!

28:30.287 --> 28:34.523
It's gonna make me
a laughingstock.

28:34.591 --> 28:37.526
You know, we came here
to start over.

28:37.594 --> 28:41.030
We came here to start over.
I am starting over!

28:43.767 --> 28:46.936
And where the hell
were you, Norman?

28:47.037 --> 28:48.370
I-I was upstairs.

28:48.471 --> 28:49.972
No, you were not!
You were not upstairs.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.540
If you were upstairs,
you would have come down,

28:51.608 --> 28:54.643
and you would have helped me.
So where were you?

28:54.744 --> 28:58.647
I snuck out of my room
and went to a party.

28:58.748 --> 29:00.215
Mom, I thought
I was gonna study with them,

29:00.317 --> 29:02.151
but they took me to a party.
I didn't know.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.886
It hardly matters right now.
There's a--

29:03.954 --> 29:05.521
there's a dead man on the floor,
there's a lake of blood!

29:05.588 --> 29:07.056
What are we supposed to do,

29:07.157 --> 29:08.457
clean this up with paper towels
and spray cleaner?

29:08.525 --> 29:09.992
I don't think so.

29:10.060 --> 29:11.727
Holy hell, mother,
we're totally screwed!

29:11.795 --> 29:13.462
What are we doing?
We don't know what we're doing!

29:13.563 --> 29:14.697
- Norman? Norman.
- We just don't know

29:14.798 --> 29:16.231
- what we're doing!
- Okay.

29:16.333 --> 29:18.834
Calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

29:18.935 --> 29:20.402
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.

29:20.503 --> 29:23.005
Look, it's gonna be fine.

29:23.073 --> 29:27.076
It's gonna be okay.

29:27.143 --> 29:29.912
Here's what we're gonna do...

29:29.980 --> 29:31.747
Okay, we're gonna take
all the bed linens

29:31.848 --> 29:33.649
from every motel room,
and we're gonna use it

29:33.750 --> 29:35.517
to soak this all up.

29:35.618 --> 29:38.053
We're gonna wrap the body
in one of the comforters,

29:38.154 --> 29:40.422
and we'll put it in a--
in one of the tubs

29:40.523 --> 29:42.191
in one
of the motel rooms just--

29:42.258 --> 29:46.095
just until I can figure out
what to do with it tomorrow.

29:46.162 --> 29:49.298
Okay.
Yeah?

29:50.300 --> 29:51.734
Norman, I'm sorry.

29:51.801 --> 29:55.404
I'm sorry that this dirtbag
raped me, okay?

29:55.505 --> 29:58.674
But here you are,
and here I am,

29:58.775 --> 30:01.810
and he's not gonna win
this one.

30:10.687 --> 30:12.421
Go wash up a little.

30:12.522 --> 30:15.524
Put your bloody clothes
in the trash bag.

30:24.968 --> 30:27.102
Mother, are you sure
we shouldn't call for help?

30:31.908 --> 30:35.244
No one's ever
gonna help us, Norman.

30:37.881 --> 30:40.549
No one's ever helped us.

30:46.890 --> 30:48.123
Don't go so fast.

30:48.224 --> 30:50.292
I can't walk that fast
backwards.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.994
It's heavy!

30:52.095 --> 30:54.897
Shh.

30:56.433 --> 30:58.467
Norman!

31:00.270 --> 31:01.470
How can there still
be more blood?

31:01.538 --> 31:02.971
Just get him in the tub first,

31:03.073 --> 31:05.841
then we'll figure
everything else out.

31:15.351 --> 31:16.618
Unh.

31:16.719 --> 31:20.789
Get him off me!
Get him off me.

31:20.890 --> 31:22.858
Okay.

31:22.959 --> 31:25.194
One...two...three.

31:38.908 --> 31:41.510
Mom, what are gonna do?

31:41.611 --> 31:44.613
We're gonna deal with the rug.

31:54.624 --> 31:56.892
We're gonna have to pull up
the whole carpet.

31:56.993 --> 31:58.293
Tonight?
It's already midnight.

31:58.361 --> 31:59.995
And not only this one,

32:00.096 --> 32:02.131
we're gonna have to pull up
four through seven.

32:02.198 --> 32:04.867
They all have the same carpet.

32:04.934 --> 32:06.401
So that way,
this creep goes missing,

32:06.469 --> 32:09.905
anyone comes,
starts asking us questions,

32:10.006 --> 32:12.174
you know, nothing will be
out of the ordinary here.

32:12.275 --> 32:15.077
We're just--just doing
some renovations, you know?

32:15.178 --> 32:18.180
We're just--
just recarpeting.

32:20.617 --> 32:24.186
How the hell
do we pull up carpeting?

34:21.120 --> 34:24.956
Good evening, gentlemen.

34:25.024 --> 34:26.937
I was about to tell you

34:27.056 --> 34:29.201
we're not open
for business yet, but...

34:29.607 --> 34:32.697
it doesn't look like
you're looking for a room.

34:32.764 --> 34:36.034
I'm Norma Bates.
We moved in a few days ago.

34:36.101 --> 34:37.902
No, ma'am.
No, not looking for a room.

34:38.003 --> 34:40.204
Deputy Zack Shelby.

34:40.306 --> 34:42.639
- This is Sheriff Alex Romero.
- We just wanted to make sure

34:42.741 --> 34:44.141
everything was all right here.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.877
We didn't know anybody
had moved in yet.

34:45.945 --> 34:48.579
Oh, that's kind of you.
Yeah, we're all fine.

34:48.647 --> 34:50.081
Yeah, my son and I are just

34:50.181 --> 34:51.649
pulling up some carpeting
we're replacing.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.918
We're just updating.
God knows it could use--

34:54.018 --> 34:55.420
You have a son?

34:55.487 --> 34:58.589
Yeah, my son, Norman.
He's 17.

34:58.657 --> 35:02.360
- Norma and Norman.
- Yeah.

35:02.461 --> 35:04.662
That's...unusual.

35:04.763 --> 35:07.265
Well, boys take their father's
names all the time.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.567
You know, it's almost
2:00 in the morning.

35:09.668 --> 35:10.935
Your son's got school tomorrow.

35:11.036 --> 35:12.203
You really think
this is a good idea to--

35:12.304 --> 35:14.839
I had no idea it was that late.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.841
But thanks for letting me know.
I'm gonna go close up shop.

35:16.942 --> 35:18.576
What happened to your hand?

35:18.677 --> 35:20.445
Um...

35:20.546 --> 35:23.681
I just--
I scratched it with, um...

35:23.749 --> 35:26.451
I was cutting carpet,
and it just--

35:26.552 --> 35:29.387
It's nothing.
It's a nick.

35:34.326 --> 35:36.627
It was nice to meet you.

35:36.695 --> 35:39.764
Thank you.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.936
- Mrs. Bates, you...
- Yes, sheriff?

35:45.037 --> 35:48.306
Wouldn't mind if we take
a look inside, would you?

35:48.407 --> 35:50.608
No, no, not at all.
Come.

35:50.676 --> 35:53.044
Yeah.

36:00.853 --> 36:02.153
Evening.

36:06.225 --> 36:08.793
Norman...

36:08.861 --> 36:11.562
This is Sheriff Romero
and Deputy Shelby.

36:11.663 --> 36:13.798
They--they saw the lights on
and were kind enough

36:13.866 --> 36:15.066
to check on us.

36:15.134 --> 36:18.102
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

36:18.203 --> 36:21.672
That's extremely good of you.

36:23.609 --> 36:25.276
Oh, everything's good here.

36:25.344 --> 36:28.846
- Except for this carpeting.
- Sheriff Romero wanted to...

36:28.947 --> 36:30.448
Well, you wanted
to see what we're doing.

36:30.516 --> 36:32.984
I guess you're
a little interested in design?

36:33.052 --> 36:35.286
Wouldn't put it that way.

36:35.387 --> 36:38.322
It's a rare man that is.

36:38.424 --> 36:41.793
Let me tell you, nothing bored
my late husband more,

36:41.860 --> 36:43.294
may he rest in peace.

36:43.395 --> 36:46.064
Oh, you're a widow.
Sorry about that.

36:46.184 --> 36:47.799
Yeah.
Six months ago.

36:47.866 --> 36:50.101
We're trying to get used to it.

36:50.169 --> 36:52.837
Can I use your bathroom?

36:52.938 --> 36:56.307
- This bathroom?
- Yeah.

36:56.408 --> 37:00.211
- This bathroom is broken.
- What's wrong with it?

37:00.312 --> 37:02.232
- It's not flushing.
- All these toilets do that.

37:02.247 --> 37:05.483
I told Summers he needed
to replace them ten years ago.

37:05.584 --> 37:07.819
You gotta jiggle the chain.
It--I'll take a look at it.

37:27.306 --> 37:29.574
- Nice night, huh?
- Yeah.

37:30.053 --> 37:31.587
Where you guys from?

37:31.688 --> 37:33.956
We're from--
we're from Arizona.

37:34.057 --> 37:35.297
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, right--like,

37:35.358 --> 37:36.725
right outside of Scottsdale.

37:36.826 --> 37:38.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I know Arizona.

37:38.161 --> 37:39.628
I was there once.

37:39.729 --> 37:42.130
Yeah, the air there,
it was--

37:42.232 --> 37:44.933
it was unlike anything else
I'd ever experienced.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.735
The air here at night
is nice too.

37:46.803 --> 37:50.239
Yep, yeah.
Yeah, it is, it's--

37:50.340 --> 37:52.875
It is.

38:05.455 --> 38:07.456
You just gotta jiggle it.

38:08.992 --> 38:10.553
Unit one,
we have a vehicle collision,

38:10.560 --> 38:12.928
multiple injuries,
at Ocean and Sea Bluff.

38:16.900 --> 38:21.403
Ma'am...
Get the boy to bed, ma'am.

38:21.471 --> 38:23.472
Ms. Bates.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.728
He's new, all right?

39:19.829 --> 39:22.397
He's not used to the food yet.

39:23.566 --> 39:25.834
Make sure you're done.

39:25.935 --> 39:29.504
Don't try to cut it short
just because it's embarrassing.

39:29.572 --> 39:33.208
I think I'm done.

39:33.309 --> 39:37.179
Mint.
It'll calm your stomach.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.513
Thanks.

39:38.581 --> 39:40.182
I'm kind of an expert
on vomiting.

39:40.283 --> 39:43.352
I have C.F., so I've been
on meds my whole life.

39:43.453 --> 39:45.554
Some of them give you any number
of hideous side effects,

39:45.655 --> 39:48.757
puking being one
of the more pleasant ones.

39:51.094 --> 39:53.362
Do you have some sort
of chronic illness?

39:53.463 --> 39:55.664
- No.
- Oh.

39:57.767 --> 40:00.335
I'm Emma...Decody.

40:00.403 --> 40:01.737
Nor--Norman Bates.

40:01.838 --> 40:05.273
Yeah, I think we have
Language Arts together.

40:06.776 --> 40:11.013
Well, I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

40:11.114 --> 40:14.016
Are you...okay?

40:14.117 --> 40:16.418
I'm okay.

41:07.603 --> 41:10.939
God, I hope he fits
in the trunk.

41:35.064 --> 41:36.665
Are you all right?

41:36.766 --> 41:39.768
I'm fine.
Let's do this.

41:55.351 --> 41:57.652
I suck.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.654
Mom, he attacked you.

41:59.756 --> 42:02.991
I'm not even talking about him.

42:04.494 --> 42:07.529
I found out today
that the city is building

42:07.597 --> 42:09.998
a new bypass
on the far side of town.

42:10.066 --> 42:12.058
It's gonna be
the new main road.

42:14.670 --> 42:16.872
I bought a motel that no one

42:16.973 --> 42:18.874
is ever gonna know
is even there.

42:18.975 --> 42:21.543
Why didn't the real estate guy
tell you that?

42:21.611 --> 42:24.346
Because, Norman, people suck.

42:24.447 --> 42:27.649
I'll tell you, everyone
I have ever known has sucked.

42:27.717 --> 42:30.819
Except you.

42:34.312 --> 42:35.824
God, you're too good for me.

42:35.892 --> 42:37.826
I'm the worst mother
in the world.

42:37.894 --> 42:40.164
- Mother--
- Look at what we're doing, Norman.

42:40.284 --> 42:42.664
You deserve so much better.

42:42.732 --> 42:44.333
You know, when you were born,
it was like

42:44.367 --> 42:47.269
God gave me a second chance.
And all I ever wanted

42:47.336 --> 42:50.397
was for life to be beautiful
for you, and look at it.

42:51.629 --> 42:53.842
Look at what your life
has been.

42:53.910 --> 42:57.579
I mean,
what good am I doing you?

42:57.680 --> 43:01.249
Mom, you're everything...

43:01.350 --> 43:03.718
everything to me.

43:03.820 --> 43:07.823
And I don't ever want to live
in a world without you.

43:09.692 --> 43:13.361
You're my family.

43:13.462 --> 43:17.465
My whole family, my whole life,
my whole self.

43:20.169 --> 43:23.171
You always have been.

43:25.441 --> 43:29.077
It's like there's
a cord between our hearts.

43:33.015 --> 43:37.886
Honey, that's--
that's from <i>Jane Eyre.</i>

43:37.987 --> 43:40.889
Yeah.
Orson Welles says it to...

43:40.990 --> 43:44.426
- Joan Fontaine.
- Right.

43:44.527 --> 43:47.095
But you know what I mean.

43:47.196 --> 43:51.066
It's you and me.
It's always been you and me.

43:54.270 --> 43:56.905
We belong to each other.

43:59.008 --> 44:00.675
I love you, Norman.

44:00.743 --> 44:03.901
You're the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

44:04.135 --> 44:05.344
I love you too, mom.

44:19.984 --> 44:21.718
I guess this is deep enough.

45:59.490 --> 46:03.126
Come here!
I have a surprise for you.

46:05.497 --> 46:06.696
Okay, look, look, look,
look, look!

46:06.797 --> 46:08.441
I turned it on.

46:11.969 --> 46:15.104
I made it blue.
It's your favorite color.

46:15.205 --> 46:17.249
- It's cool, mom.
- Yeah.

46:17.369 --> 46:19.623
It's ours, Norman.
It's our very own.

46:21.245 --> 46:24.046
And you know what?
You know that new bypass?

46:24.148 --> 46:27.083
- They're not gonna build it.
- When did that happen?

46:27.151 --> 46:29.719
It didn't, yet.

46:29.786 --> 46:31.821
I'll think of something.

46:31.889 --> 46:34.824
I'm sure you will.

46:34.892 --> 46:37.065
What's important
is that we're together.

46:37.286 --> 46:39.034
And as long as we're together,

46:39.135 --> 46:41.170
then nothing bad
can really happen.

46:41.237 --> 46:44.707
- Right, Norman?
- Right, mother.

46:44.774 --> 46:47.610
Yeah.
