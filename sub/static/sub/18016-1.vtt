<i>It's</i> a
<i>beautiful Birmingham morning</i>

04:40.440 --> 04:43.046
<i>and the holiday season
looks merry and bright.</i>

04:44.000 --> 04:46.128
<i>Are you ready for the holidays?</i>

04:46.200 --> 04:47.565
<i>Not me.</i>

04:47.680 --> 04:49.808
<i>Man, I got five kids.</i>

04:49.880 --> 04:51.450
<i>Four of them are mine.</i>

04:51.560 --> 04:53.289
<i>Allegedly.</i>

04:54.560 --> 04:57.609
<i>Have you been naughty?
Or have you been nice?</i>

04:58.560 --> 05:00.562
<i>So many people coming into town.</i>

05:00.640 --> 05:01.641
<i>What about you?</i>

05:01.720 --> 05:03.449
<i>You got family or friends
coming to town?</i>

05:05.040 --> 05:06.087
<i>Me?</i>

05:06.240 --> 05:08.481
<i>I hope it's not my in-laws.</i>

05:08.560 --> 05:10.164
<i>Unless they're listening.</i>

05:10.240 --> 05:14.086
<i>If so, I can't wait to see ya!</i>

05:14.880 --> 05:18.885
<i>On the way, a little music to
get you in the holiday spirit.</i>

05:18.960 --> 05:20.086
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

05:26.480 --> 05:27.766
Yeah.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.641
All right.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.086
Here we go.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.321
I'm sorry.
I need to take this. Here.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.721
Daddy, what's going on?
Your message sounded urgent.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.326
I can't find that tin of hers.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.890
The ones with Mama's recipes?

06:04.960 --> 06:06.041
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:06.120 --> 06:08.566
They're where the pots
and pans are, Daddy.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.085
You're not trying
to cook, are you?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.447
Not without those recipes,
I'm not.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.567
Okay, good.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.800
Now, don't drive yourself
too crazy with it, all right?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.410
You know how you can get.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.369
<i>I can't wait to see you all.</i>

06:19.600 --> 06:21.602
Even your sister?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.445
<i>I can count on you two to be
civil with each other, right?</i>

06:24.520 --> 06:26.409
Yeah, of course.
I can't wait to see Rachel.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.529
<i>I'll be civil with her as
long as she's civil with me.</i>

06:29.600 --> 06:30.936
You know,
I'm looking forward to it.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.040
Rach, can I please
finish what I'm saying?

06:33.200 --> 06:36.409
Look, I'm just saying that we all want to
spend as much time as we can with Dad.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.216
What's wrong with me trying
to get you there faster?

06:38.240 --> 06:39.280
<i>I'm not some charity case.</i>

06:39.320 --> 06:42.642
Just because I'm in law school doesn't
mean I can't afford to buy plane tickets.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.880
That's exactly what it means.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.326
We talked about this.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.410
Ma'am?
Yes?

06:47.480 --> 06:48.811
This tire's got a hole in it.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.363
Just put on the spare.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.240
You mean, one of the two
you're already using?

06:57.800 --> 06:59.404
Hey! Yeah, I gotta go.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.682
Well, there's always the bus.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.841
Why?

07:06.480 --> 07:08.976
Promise me you are not gonna be
on that phone the entire holiday.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.001
I'm not. That was Rach.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.447
And you do realize I'm in the
middle of a campaign, right?

07:12.520 --> 07:13.931
Yes, and I support you.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.126
Give me that bunny!

07:15.200 --> 07:16.281
No!

07:16.360 --> 07:17.407
Slow, please.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.440
But family time is important too, which
is why you have a campaign manager.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.163
Besides, it's only a week.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.522
Promise me we'll have fun
at your dad's.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.681
Promise.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.361
Family time.

07:34.760 --> 07:35.966
I was cutting it off.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.202
I thought you were
getting here last night?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.965
Well, coach dropped another practice
on us, but I'm on my way now.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.122
All right, all right.
Just drive safe.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.488
And none of that Tweetbooking,
or Faceprogramming

07:47.560 --> 07:48.800
<i>or Snap whatever that is, okay?</i>

07:48.840 --> 07:49.921
Dad, it's...
88.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.336
I gotta go. Yeah.
I'ma see you soon.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.361
Okay. I love you.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.408
Love you too, Pops.
No, stay down. Stay down.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.968
Got an early Christmas gift.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.011
Shoulder's good as new.
Yes!

08:01.080 --> 08:03.606
You can finally get off those
meds and back on the field

08:03.680 --> 08:06.604
because you've been cleared
for the bowl game!

08:06.680 --> 08:07.681
Yes!

08:07.760 --> 08:10.525
Yo, 88 is back
in the building, man!

08:10.600 --> 08:11.965
Yeah. Thank you, Coach.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.367
Listen, I am really proud of all the hard
work you've been putting in lately.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.441
Thanks.

08:18.240 --> 08:22.211
And I know that this is gonna be
your first holiday at home since...

08:22.280 --> 08:23.281
Coach, you know what?

08:24.240 --> 08:25.685
I'm really good. I'm good.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.450
All right. Happy holidays.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.846
Yeah, same.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.923
All right.
Listen up, everyone.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.207
I don't want you pigging out
over the holidays.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.327
Gotta win this thing.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.289
Come on, Coach.
It's Christmas!

08:52.800 --> 08:55.371
I love how the ring
just glimmers.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.169
See? When the light hits it?

08:57.520 --> 08:59.329
I was a champion in Croatia.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.970
You know I played
in the NBA also?

09:01.120 --> 09:03.202
1991, Seattle SuperSonics.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.602
I made the last shot
in the playoffs.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.843
They called me
Lonnie "Shatao" Maclay.

09:08.920 --> 09:09.920
You know what Shatao is?

09:09.960 --> 09:13.328
Shatao is the sound that the ball
makes when it goes through the net.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.767
Shatao! Like, Shatao!

09:15.840 --> 09:18.207
So, would you like
a mid-size or a sedan?

09:18.280 --> 09:20.328
Could I get a little
help here, Lonnie, huh?

09:20.400 --> 09:21.447
A sedan!

09:21.520 --> 09:23.363
What are you talking
about over there?

09:23.440 --> 09:25.169
Will you help me with the bags?

09:25.480 --> 09:27.642
Here's a little
early Christmas gift.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.407
Could be worth a lot
of money on eBay.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.045
But let it marinate.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.485
Okay. Okay?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.241
Lonnie!

09:36.480 --> 09:37.720
Did you bring those damn cards?

09:40.360 --> 09:41.521
Shatao!

09:41.640 --> 09:42.801
Your face.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.841
Yeah.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.246
Shit!

10:19.240 --> 10:20.401
Yeah!

10:34.880 --> 10:36.325
Oh, man.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.481
I'm trying.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.090
May Devaroux, Johnson, Davis...

10:57.160 --> 10:58.605
Shit, there was a lot of them.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.883
I am here. And how's my
favorite brother-in-law doing?

11:02.640 --> 11:04.881
May, I'm your only
brother-in-law.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.411
Well, lucky you!

11:06.720 --> 11:09.246
Damn, I forgot how old you are.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.490
Come on, give it to me.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.765
How you doing, baby?

11:14.840 --> 11:15.841
It's coming.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.091
It's coming.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.361
You holding on?

11:19.440 --> 11:20.441
I'm holding on.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.601
You holding on, baby.

11:21.680 --> 11:26.641
Yeah, I was expecting you
in a day, or two, or three...

11:26.960 --> 11:28.450
If I'd have known,
I would have...

11:28.520 --> 11:30.329
Dusted. Damn, Walter!

11:30.840 --> 11:32.080
Changed the locks.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.088
Your ass is old, so I'm
gonna let that one slide.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.611
Now, I just thought my brother-in-law
could use a little extra help

11:38.760 --> 11:40.125
so I said, what the hell.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.005
And Stevie Wonder blind ass
done canceled the tour

11:43.080 --> 11:44.416
because they gave him
the schedule.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.728
Who gonna give his blind ass
the schedule? Damn!

11:47.800 --> 11:49.564
Messing with my money, baby.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.847
But such is the life
of a background singer.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.649
Now, listen, my bags are in the driveway
so be a dear and go get them for me.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.096
And I'ma whip
a little something up

11:58.120 --> 11:59.856
so the kids have something
to eat when they get here.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.008
Perfect. As long as
I don't have to eat it.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.163
Walter Meyers, you can kiss
all my ass, okay?

12:05.240 --> 12:08.164
You know the shit I cook is
good shit. Don't do that now.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.960
You've been eating that bad shit.
That's why your ass looks so frail.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.850
Look at yourself.
Knees knocking and shit.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.326
And where's the liquor, Walter?

12:15.600 --> 12:17.568
And I hope it ain't
that dark liquor, damn it.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.689
Because that dark liquor
make a bitch wanna fight!

12:20.800 --> 12:22.040
<i>Pop-pop!</i>

12:22.640 --> 12:23.971
We made it!

12:24.040 --> 12:25.690
Hi, Grandpa!
Hi!

12:26.760 --> 12:28.489
You're even prettier
than I last saw you.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.890
Yeah! How do you do that?

12:31.960 --> 12:32.961
I don't know.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.610
How you doing, Granddad?

12:35.840 --> 12:37.763
You still hitting those books, I see.
Yes, sir.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.605
Yes, he got six A's and one B.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.170
The B was in gym.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.965
When your Uncle Evan gets here,
he can help you out with that.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.849
Grandpa, can I go inside
and get some cookies?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.285
Of course you can!

12:48.360 --> 12:51.284
Cameron! Just one. Just one!
I want some too!

12:51.360 --> 12:52.456
It'll be fine. Just, come on.
Honey?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.656
He's always working.
Give me a second.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.886
Sweetheart!

12:55.040 --> 12:56.644
Hey! Hey! Hey! Pop!

12:57.960 --> 12:59.371
Man, don't do that.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.721
Aw!

13:03.280 --> 13:04.281
How are you, Pop?

13:04.360 --> 13:07.489
I'm a little tired, but a
lot better seeing you all.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.082
Oh, my God! ls that...

13:10.160 --> 13:12.891
Christian, you promised.
Family time.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.856
No, no. That's what this will...
That's what this is.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.963
He's here so that I won't have
to be on the phone as much.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.088
Which gives me more time for family.
Oh, my God.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.536
Andy Brooks.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.976
He's my campaign manager, Pop.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.721
Boy, you have raised a very
promising, young, future congressman

13:26.800 --> 13:29.451
and his beautiful wife,
who you didn't raise.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.726
You raised him. He's your son.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.520
Hope that doesn't come
as a surprise to you.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.456
I didn't know you're
campaigning over the holidays.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.561
These cookies are amazing!

13:35.640 --> 13:36.721
Give me that.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.526
Hey, Cameron. Take
your aunt's luggage in. There.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.045
That's a lot of luggage.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.645
Probably half of them are wigs.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.211
Hey, and take yours in.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.441
We're staying here?

13:46.560 --> 13:47.891
Mmm-hmm.
Yay!

13:47.960 --> 13:50.611
Hold on, son. We're not staying here.
We're staying at a hotel.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.011
We are staying at the hotel?

13:52.080 --> 13:54.128
I thought we were. I assumed.
Let me talk.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.486
No.
No.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.643
Pop, we got a hotel room because
we didn't wanna be a bother.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.404
Family is never a bother.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.484
We're all going
to stay right here.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.642
The kids can sleep in
the bunk beds in the basement.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.210
Aw! Thanks, Pop.
Yeah. Okay.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.009
This is great.
Sounds good to me.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.684
Sounds good to you?

14:10.760 --> 14:12.205
Really, Brooks?

14:12.520 --> 14:14.488
You know what?
I'm gonna like that hotel.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.690
It's actually a really good hotel. They
got a free breakfast and a free spa.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.286
And I encourage everybody
to join me. For the breakfast.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.091
I think the four of us
in a spa would...

14:25.120 --> 14:26.296
Just a little bit. Thanks.
Okay.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.736
This is the last time
I'm gonna let you...

14:27.760 --> 14:28.966
I know. I know.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.969
He's a lot, but he's
the best at what he does.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.280
Sir, sir.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.647
I just wanted to express
my condolences on your loss.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.042
The African American woman is the
backbone of the black family.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.043
Really of the whole
American family.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.647
I mean, who wasn't raised by a black woman?
I know I was.

14:45.720 --> 14:46.816
You know what?
I'm getting a phone call,

14:46.840 --> 14:50.401
so I'm gonna have to put a
pause on this conversation,

14:50.480 --> 14:51.891
which I'm really
enjoying. It's...

14:51.960 --> 14:55.646
You're a wonderful conversationalist.
I hope someone's told you that.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.131
Dan! Dan, you said
the call was in 15 minutes.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.801
See them at the game.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.968
Yeah, man. I got the pics.
I'm on my way.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.690
Hey, what's up?
Hey, Evan.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.401
I got them, man.
I'm on my way right now.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.456
I'ma hit you tomorrow though,
because I can't kick it tonight.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.686
I'ma hit you after church.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.491
Boy, you ain't going to church, man.
Get outta here.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.051
No, no! No, I got it.
All right.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.963
I got it.
Happy holidays.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.080
Okay.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.201
Twigs!

15:33.680 --> 15:34.681
Who's Twigs?

15:35.120 --> 15:36.963
My nickname in high school.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.128
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.
What's up?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.406
Hey!

15:40.720 --> 15:42.051
You must be Niya.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.600
We haven't been properly
introduced. I'm Malachi.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.081
Nice to meet you.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.969
Let me grab these bags.
I got it.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.969
Don't bother. Let me
help you with your bags.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.042
Why? Because I'm a woman,
I can't help myself?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.846
No. Because I'm a grown man,
and that's what grown men do.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.081
Munchie?

15:56.280 --> 16:00.205
Munchie, don't forget to get the
Eskimo Pies from the store, baby.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.281
Okay, Mama.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.603
And would you get
me the vinegar potato chips, baby?

16:05.040 --> 16:06.166
All right, and a mud pie.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.446
Okay, Mama.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.645
Hey, Rachel!

16:10.840 --> 16:11.887
You know he's single.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.081
Ha.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.723
Rach!
Auntie!

16:15.800 --> 16:17.484
Hey!
Hi, baby!

16:18.240 --> 16:19.401
Hey, Malachi!

16:20.280 --> 16:21.725
Cameron! Dee!

16:25.720 --> 16:26.960
So, where's your husband?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.690
Ex-husband.
Yeah?

16:31.680 --> 16:33.842
Oh. Oh.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.049
Since I'm here visiting my mom for
the week, maybe we can grab a...

16:37.120 --> 16:38.121
I'm okay.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.491
You sure you don't want a hand?

16:42.800 --> 16:43.801
No, thanks.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.002
No, no. No, I got it. Thank you.
You sure?

16:46.080 --> 16:47.360
It's not a problem.
No. I got it.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.811
Those bags look heavy.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.001
I got it.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.048
Clearly,
it's a different technique.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.646
See? I had it.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.121
Had it the whole time.
I do Pilates. So...

17:00.600 --> 17:01.681
This girl.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.569
Somebody come
help me with these bags!

17:08.920 --> 17:11.844
I was in the kitchen.
I was helping Aunt May.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.160
Hi!

17:14.119 --> 17:16.441
What's... It still
doesn't even seem real.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.288
I know. I know.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.721
How was your trip?

17:24.040 --> 17:25.804
Good. Good.

17:25.880 --> 17:26.961
How's school?

17:28.240 --> 17:31.050
Good. I may have
to sit out next semester...

17:31.120 --> 17:32.565
What? What are you
talking about?

17:32.640 --> 17:33.721
No. It's expensive.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.643
Who's that making
all that noise out here?

17:35.760 --> 17:37.444
Part-time job. I'll be okay.
Okay.

17:37.760 --> 17:38.966
Hey, Daddy!

17:39.360 --> 17:40.600
How are you?

17:40.680 --> 17:41.727
God!

17:41.800 --> 17:45.168
A lot better now that
my little baby girl's here.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.368
How are you really?

17:47.480 --> 17:48.481
Um...

17:50.720 --> 17:52.245
It's Christmas.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.286
I miss you.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.769
Somebody else is here.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.083
Guess who? Hi! Daddy!

18:00.160 --> 18:01.525
Hey! Look at you!

18:04.760 --> 18:07.081
Look at you!

18:07.160 --> 18:08.161
God!

18:09.400 --> 18:10.765
Sonya!

18:12.160 --> 18:13.525
Cheryl, I missed you.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.442
You look amazing!
Politics agrees with you.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.760
Thank you!

18:19.720 --> 18:20.721
Hey!

18:21.200 --> 18:22.247
Rachel!

18:22.320 --> 18:23.651
Hi, Cheryl.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.643
Wait. Who is that?
Lonnie!

18:29.200 --> 18:30.406
Hey, Lonnie.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.051
Merry Christmas, everybody!

18:34.920 --> 18:36.046
Good to be here!

18:36.120 --> 18:38.361
Uh-oh. I got a little
something for you.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.250
How about an early
Christmas gift for everybody.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.243
Lonnie, nobody
wants that right now.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.651
Everybody wants it. Come on.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.926
Here you go. One for you.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.936
You get one, and you're going
to appreciate that one.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.176
What is this?
One for you.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.281
You have hair!

18:50.360 --> 18:51.600
Of course I had hair in '93.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.961
Hey, that's going to be
very valuable one day.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.536
I'm telling you, if something happens
to me, something happens to you!

18:56.560 --> 18:58.085
In a good way,
if you know what I mean.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.965
So, hold on to it.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.203
Walter, I'm so hungry. I've been traveling.
Right, baby? Oh!

19:03.280 --> 19:04.496
Anything in the kitchen to eat?

19:04.520 --> 19:06.363
Aunt May's putting
something together to eat.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.647
Why does that sound like
a terrorist threat to me?

19:08.720 --> 19:11.769
Say another damn thing, Lonnie!
Your ass is whooped in here tonight!

19:11.840 --> 19:13.496
I'm going to make sure these
two don't kill each other.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.807
Granddad! Can we please
turn on rooftop Santa?

19:15.880 --> 19:17.370
When are we going to turn it on?

19:17.440 --> 19:21.570
I'm sorry, buddy, but I couldn't
get it to work this year.

19:21.920 --> 19:26.323
Oh! You know, when I left the
league, I dabbled in electronics.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.401
You know what that means?

19:27.920 --> 19:30.924
That means I'm going to have
that Santa working in no time.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.001
Ding, ding, ding!

19:32.680 --> 19:34.045
Thanks, Uncle Lonnie!

19:34.640 --> 19:36.608
Uncle Lonnie's going
to fix rooftop Santa!

19:36.680 --> 19:38.205
You worked
two weeks at Best Buy.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.926
You're right.
But I worked like a dog!

19:41.000 --> 19:44.766
If I do my math right, that's
like 14 weeks in dog years.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.444
I left that place barking.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.682
They will never forget
Lonnie Maclay.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.371
Uh-oh! Auntie May,
I smell that food.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.771
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.201
I'm in the bathroom!

19:55.440 --> 19:58.284
He's a regular Renaissance man.
You should be so proud.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.683
Well, why don't you all
get settled in?

20:02.760 --> 20:05.764
I have to run down to the shelter.
I'll be back in a minute.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.216
Do you want me
to come with you, Daddy?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.083
No, no, no.
Yeah, no. I'll come.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.369
No, no, no.
You two, you connect up.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.847
You haven't seen each other,
I don't know when.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.570
I'll be back, okay?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.485
Love you both.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.761
Walter?

21:24.520 --> 21:26.204
Hi!

21:26.360 --> 21:28.567
Oh. Good.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.968
My goodness!
It's so good to have you here.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.040
Oh, boy.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.970
Christmas would not be
Christmas without you.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.441
And my Grace, you couldn't
drag her away from here.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.931
Remember when
the lights went out?

21:42.360 --> 21:46.001
Yeah, the lights went out. You
know I'm scared of the dark.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.162
We tried to find
candles everywhere.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.605
Everything.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.810
I'm telling you, you and Grace
were my best friends.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.928
I know.
I've missed you guys so much.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.326
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.447
Hey, Walter.
All right.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.683
Thank you. I have something for you.
Okay.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.491
I do.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.562
Grace had it framed

22:04.640 --> 22:07.211
and she didn't have a chance
to give it to you.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.523
Who knew her sweet heart
would give out so suddenly?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.287
She's so beautiful.

22:16.680 --> 22:17.727
I'll be right back.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.245
All right.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.926
Hi, kids! Don't forget, we have
finger painting later today.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.001
Wow.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.888
You sure are fine, girl.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.602
I don't look that bad either.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.696
Sorry it took so long for dinner.
I hope y'all ready.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.736
I figured y'all would be hungry
from all that traveling,

22:42.760 --> 22:44.256
so I put a little something
together for y'all.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.362
You shouldn't have.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.256
You didn't have to go through
all that trouble, Aunt May.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.363
Baby, this is no trouble at all.
Now y'all are my family.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.841
And this right here,

22:52.920 --> 22:57.323
this is my spiced mung bean
winter casserole.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.642
Got that from Ike
and Tina Turner, 1972.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.246
And right here,

23:01.320 --> 23:06.531
this is my Korean dry, squid
salad with authentic kimchi.

23:06.680 --> 23:10.127
Mick Jagger, 1983.
That was a special tour.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.966
This looks like
all the ingredients to vomit.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.691
And this here is Aunt May's
prized possession, baby.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.211
I put my foot in this.

23:17.280 --> 23:20.090
This is my potato salad
from Poland.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.289
Pickled fish, duck sausage
with mayonnaise.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.850
And to wash it all down,

23:24.960 --> 23:28.806
some milk tea
with boiled tapioca balls.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.962
Little Richard gave me
that one. Yes!

23:33.000 --> 23:34.001
Who wants pizza?
Me!

23:34.080 --> 23:35.081
I do!
Extra sausage.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.456
- Pepperoni!
- We like thick crust.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.016
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Thick crust.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.121
Hey! Wait a minute.

23:39.200 --> 23:43.091
Your Aunt May went through a lot
of trouble preparing all this.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.207
Yes, I did.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.647
The least we could do

23:46.720 --> 23:50.042
is to eat her...

23:51.520 --> 23:52.567
What's this?

23:52.640 --> 23:53.640
Thank you, Walter.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.125
Because this right here, baby,

23:55.200 --> 23:59.569
this is my spiced mung bean
winter casserole

23:59.680 --> 24:00.681
with a hint of...

24:00.760 --> 24:01.761
Spam.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.444
Limburger cheese.
Baby lotion?

24:03.520 --> 24:05.966
You all remind my ass
when to laugh, okay?

24:06.040 --> 24:09.010
Aunt May, this looks
like a million bucks.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.081
Thank you, baby.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.288
And Cameron is going to be
the first one to try it.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.966
Wait! Why do I have to eat it?
I didn't do anything wrong!

24:15.040 --> 24:16.336
Don't talk back
to your mother, boy.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.486
Why can't you eat it?

24:17.600 --> 24:18.656
Don't talk back to your daddy.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.682
Y'all are all going
to owe me a huge apology.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.966
Here we go.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.441
Just a little taste
to kick off the celebration.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.520
I don't want to die.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.846
Open your mouth.

24:26.920 --> 24:30.447
Here, hold his nose. Hold his
nose so he opens his mouth.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.284
Be a man now.
Hold his nose!

24:32.400 --> 24:34.402
Open! Okay.
Open up. Get it in.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.130
There you go.
Seal it!

24:36.240 --> 24:37.685
- Chew it!
- Cameron, are you okay?

24:37.760 --> 24:39.330
You ungrateful bastards!

24:39.400 --> 24:40.686
The whole lot of you!

24:40.760 --> 24:42.856
Now I'm in there slaving my ass
off trying to make it right.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.963
You think his ass upset right now? Wait
till he finds out you not his daddy.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.041
Aunt May!
Aunt May!

24:47.120 --> 24:49.646
It's not that we wouldn't like it.
We just don't recognize it.

24:49.720 --> 24:50.881
Kiss my ass.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.610
Put it on a plate then.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.656
And I guarantee you it's better
than this food on this table.

24:54.680 --> 24:56.330
And I don't know
where your ass been at.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.447
Lonnie.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.761
Am I wrong?

24:59.920 --> 25:01.081
I'm sorry, Walter.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.400
Look, well, at least
there's bread.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.736
Here, baby, have some bread.
Here, have some bread.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.416
Baby, you know, Brooks has
got me on a meal plan.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.521
Mommy!

25:08.600 --> 25:09.656
It doesn't look good in here.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.727
It's a low-carb...

25:10.800 --> 25:15.362
Daddy, Aunt May doesn't think she's actually
cooking Christmas dinner, does she?

25:15.440 --> 25:16.851
With any luck, she's not.

25:16.920 --> 25:20.367
Grace always believed in
everybody pitching in.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.361
Grandma let me snap the peas.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.363
She did, she did.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.090
She used to make me
clean a tub of greens.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.243
She would be like, "Rachel, make sure
you get those bugs out them greens."

25:29.320 --> 25:30.367
Yeah.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.001
Somehow I always ended up having a
ton of bugs in my greens anyway.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.243
But you barreled through. Didn't you?
Didn't let that stop you.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.845
Extra protein.
Yeah.

25:39.160 --> 25:42.926
Remember after I got married, Mom
finally let me make the stuffing?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.650
That obviously didn't work out.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.881
Okay, really?

25:45.960 --> 25:48.201
I was talking
about the dressing.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.123
You cannot help yourself,
and it is baffling.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.248
We were talking about our mother

25:52.360 --> 25:53.936
and somehow you made it
about my marriage.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.930
I wasn't talking about your marriage.
I was talking about your divorce.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.520
At least I was smart enough
to get one.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.564
Smartness! Hey, I'm still in the room.
Okay? Girls!

26:01.640 --> 26:04.291
88's in the house!

26:07.000 --> 26:08.126
Are y'all fighting already?

26:08.200 --> 26:09.576
Niya, pack your stuff.
We're going to a hotel.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.256
A hotel? A hostel, hotel,
it's the same thing.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.456
Girls! It'll be an adventure.
Come on.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.130
Don't waste a bus pass
on my account.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.776
Pack your bags, Lonnie.
Hey, Rachel! That's called karma.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.041
We're getting the hell out of here.
Hey, Rachel! Cheryl!

26:19.760 --> 26:20.886
Here we go.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.849
You two. Get down here now!

26:23.680 --> 26:25.576
What's wrong with you two?
I didn't start this, Daddy.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.696
Oh, my God! You always start it.
Actually, you both started it.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.600
You stay out of it.
You're just making it worse.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.642
I'm makin'...
Okay. I'm Lonnie, now.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.882
This is exactly why I wanted
to stay in a hotel, Pop.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.096
Well, what's stopping you
now, huh?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.360
Nothing's stopping me.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.722
Quiet! Quiet! Hey, quiet!

26:43.640 --> 26:48.680
What would your mother say if she could
see you carrying on like this, huh?

26:50.600 --> 26:51.726
Five days.

26:52.720 --> 26:57.521
Just five days for you all
to act like a family.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.365
To act like you have the good
sense you were raised with.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.921
Five days so we can make it
through Christmas.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.081
That's all I'm asking.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.490
Can you do that? Huh?

27:13.720 --> 27:14.960
Love you, Pops.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.042
You gotta hug me back.
I need it. There it is!

27:35.360 --> 27:37.488
You all should feel
like a bunch of dumbasses.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.643
No, Aunt May, I came here with
the purest of intentions.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.364
You are just
straight up delusional!

27:42.440 --> 27:43.930
Shut up!
You're the one being stupid!

27:44.000 --> 27:45.081
Shut up!

27:45.160 --> 27:47.891
Now just shut the shit up!
I'm sick of it.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.008
Your daddy too damn old
for all this bullshit.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.416
Now if y'all don't get your asses in
that kitchen and apologize right now,

27:53.440 --> 27:56.091
I'm kicking everybody's ass
in here. Come on.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.321
Well, I just walked in.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.731
Boy, listen here.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.361
Your little ass got on them red Bozo shoes.
That's why you gotta apologize.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.805
Get your asses in the kitchen.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.696
Y'all need to get yourselves together
so we can go to church tomorrow.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.769
Look at this.
Look at this young shit, here.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.049
Push a bitch again!

28:13.120 --> 28:15.964
Push a bitch again!
God damn it!

28:16.120 --> 28:18.521
Y'all gotta go to church
tomorrow. You get there early.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.967
Lonnie, get your ass
away from me.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.804
This don't make no sense.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.162
They're just going
to blow my buzz.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.167
We're not going to make it
to Christmas, are we?

28:31.240 --> 28:33.083
Huh! Not a damn chance.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.480
<i>That's some good liquor
right there, baby.</i>

28:37.480 --> 28:39.440
And the award for the most
outstanding performance

28:39.480 --> 28:42.370
on offense, defense,
and special teams

28:42.440 --> 28:45.046
for the Sportsman
of the Universe...

28:45.160 --> 28:47.322
I'm talking
for the entire millennium.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.802
Ladies and gentlemen,
number 88, Evan Meyers!

28:53.280 --> 28:54.327
Is it...

28:55.320 --> 28:56.970
I can't...

28:57.640 --> 29:01.326
You guys are so kind.
My gosh! Thank you!

29:03.160 --> 29:08.007
You know what I mean.
That's just how I do.

29:27.320 --> 29:30.927
Uncle Evan, Granddad said hurry
up. We're going to be late for church.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.729
All right, Cam. I'm coming.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.604
<i>God, you're holy Yes, you are</i>

30:11.680 --> 30:14.126
<i>God, you're worthy Yes, you are</i>

30:14.200 --> 30:15.884
<i>We give you our praise</i>

30:17.960 --> 30:21.521
Now, you know not one of us has been
to church since we left Birmingham.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.696
And now we're just supposed to
come in here and act like...

30:23.720 --> 30:25.210
We anointed!

30:25.280 --> 30:27.009
Praise Him!
Hallelujah!

30:27.080 --> 30:28.366
How are you?

30:28.440 --> 30:29.680
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

30:29.760 --> 30:31.728
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

30:31.800 --> 30:33.882
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

30:40.240 --> 30:43.244
"Unto us a child is born.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.964
"Unto us, a son is given.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.927
"And his name

30:50.080 --> 30:52.048
"shall be called Wonderful."

30:52.160 --> 30:53.764
Wonderful!

30:53.920 --> 30:55.524
Before we get started
this morning,

30:55.600 --> 31:00.640
I want to welcome all of our
visitors and our CME Christians.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.530
They only make it on Christmas,
Mother's Day, and Easter.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.922
Also, want to recognize
one of our longest serving

31:10.000 --> 31:12.207
and dearest brothers in Christ,

31:12.280 --> 31:16.365
Brother Walter Meyers, here
with his beautiful family.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.010
Lonnie! Lonnie!

31:20.280 --> 31:22.931
Let's not make it about me.
This is about Jesus.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.323
Stop it. Sit down.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.208
Now we haven't seen
Brother Meyers for a while

31:32.280 --> 31:35.250
since the passing
of our dearest Grace.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.560
You all right, son?

31:36.640 --> 31:38.296
If you're in the
neighborhood... Yeah.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.004
Stop on by and say hello.
Okay.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.082
I'm sure he would
welcome the company.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.161
Amen.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.321
Amen.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.371
Amen.

31:48.520 --> 31:52.445
Uncle Lonnie, are we still going
to fix rooftop Santa tonight?

31:52.520 --> 31:54.284
Has Uncle Lonnie
ever let you down?

31:54.720 --> 31:56.006
Yes!
Yes!

31:56.640 --> 31:59.405
Lonnie, don't you think
you should wait for Evan?

31:59.520 --> 32:01.488
Hey, I'm doing it for the kids!

32:01.560 --> 32:02.686
Your kids!

32:03.000 --> 32:06.641
My hands are going up your ass.
Ain't got no gloves or nothing.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.891
Last time a man gave you a
prostate exam with no gloves on?

32:09.960 --> 32:12.611
I really don't think you should be
messing around in there, Lonnie.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.126
Don't listen to the Grinch,
okay? I got this.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.804
Uncle Lonnie got this for you!

32:16.880 --> 32:18.530
Are you kids ready for Santa?

32:18.680 --> 32:20.091
Yeah!
Yeah!

32:20.240 --> 32:23.369
I said, who's ready for Santa?

32:23.520 --> 32:25.010
We are!
We are!

32:25.080 --> 32:26.176
I'm going to make you an icepack

32:26.200 --> 32:28.806
for the knot that's going to
be on your head when you fall.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.096
Come on, give it up for the Grinch.
Give it up for the Grinch.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.930
Cut that out! It's freezing out here.
Let's get in the house!

32:34.000 --> 32:36.401
Auntie, please. Can we stay
for just a little bit longer?

32:36.520 --> 32:38.204
Please, Mommy?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.001
All right.

32:41.720 --> 32:44.246
But the minute he's done,
you come inside, okay?

32:44.320 --> 32:46.402
Okay, Mommy.
Okay, bunny.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.491
Okay.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.766
Careful, Lonnie!

32:52.840 --> 32:54.046
Whatever.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.206
I got this. Uncle Lonnie
got this for you, okay?

32:59.280 --> 33:00.850
Uncle Lonnie said
he would do it...

33:01.880 --> 33:02.881
Ooh!

33:03.600 --> 33:05.568
Get out! Ow! Ow!

33:06.200 --> 33:07.201
Whoo!

33:08.080 --> 33:10.082
I got a little buzz
on my finger that time.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.528
Does Uncle Lonnie know
what he's doing?

33:12.600 --> 33:13.647
No.

33:13.760 --> 33:17.003
<i>Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!</i>

33:17.080 --> 33:18.320
It's working!

33:18.760 --> 33:19.761
He actually got it!

33:19.840 --> 33:20.841
Great job, Uncle Lonnie.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.001
Who's the man?

33:22.080 --> 33:23.525
Uncle Lonnie!

33:23.600 --> 33:24.960
That's what it's all about!

33:26.760 --> 33:29.047
Ding, ding, ding-
Ding, ding, ding-

33:29.760 --> 33:30.841
Good job, Uncle Lonnie!

33:30.920 --> 33:33.048
Good job! You actually did it!

33:33.120 --> 33:35.851
I did not let the Grinches
ruin Christmas for you.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.445
Uncle Lonnie!
Uncle Lonnie!

33:40.440 --> 33:41.487
That's not good.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.607
Oh! Shit!

33:46.280 --> 33:47.327
Shit!

33:52.240 --> 33:53.287
Oh, shit!

33:55.280 --> 33:56.280
<i>Ho-ho-ho!</i>

33:57.400 --> 33:59.084
Uncle Lonnie killed Santa!

33:59.960 --> 34:01.724
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Mommy!

34:01.800 --> 34:03.689
Did you get that?
I just posted it.

34:03.800 --> 34:04.800
- Good.
- Mommy!

34:04.840 --> 34:07.730
Don't tell Cheryl.
Do not tell Cheryl, okay?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.290
Uncle Lonnie has it, okay?

34:09.480 --> 34:11.050
Shit!
My gosh!

34:11.960 --> 34:13.121
Shit!

34:18.480 --> 34:19.969
Is he still breathing?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.322
We should take a selfie.

34:27.600 --> 34:31.286
Don't tell Cheryl.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.041
Hmm.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.001
You could tell me
where the tin is.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.610
Thought I heard somebody
down here.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.569
Hey, sweetheart.
Hey.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.681
<i>HEY-</i>

35:12.320 --> 35:13.970
God, she had the best smile.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.681
Yeah, she had the best everything.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.204
It's good to have you
home. Yeah.

35:22.360 --> 35:24.681
I wish you and Cheryl
were getting along better.

35:24.760 --> 35:25.886
Yeah.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.725
Been that way
since we were kids.

35:27.800 --> 35:32.010
I don't know, I mean, I guess even in
family sometimes people just don't fit.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.480
You should have seen how I used
to fight with my big brother.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.376
I know you're not trying to make
Mom's sweet potato pie, are you?

35:40.400 --> 35:43.563
There's never been a Meyers
Christmas without it.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.648
And if I'm going to make it,

35:47.160 --> 35:48.571
I'm going to make it right.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.936
<i>The top five in the
draft were supposed to be</i> a <i>lock.</i>

35:54.960 --> 35:57.122
<i>However, now that doctors
have cleared Evan Meyers</i>

35:57.200 --> 35:58.416
<i>to play in
the upcoming bowl game,</i>

35:58.440 --> 36:01.250
<i>that changes everything, everybody.
That changes everything!</i>

36:01.320 --> 36:04.164
<i>He may be naughty, but the
boy's game is real nice.</i>

36:04.240 --> 36:06.004
Poetic injustice, good morning.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.004
Look. It's the accident child
in his natural habitat.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.611
He's unfunny and, therefore,
a liability to the pride.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.965
It's a shame, he won't make it.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.640
I was not an accident.

36:17.720 --> 36:21.406
Everyone has their fourth child
in their 50s. That's common.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.376
<i>You better not
shrink from the spotlight.</i>

36:23.400 --> 36:25.209
<i>Merry Christmas, young man.</i>

36:25.640 --> 36:26.766
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

36:34.320 --> 36:36.561
Hey. Evan.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.045
You locked me out.
What?

36:39.120 --> 36:40.451
You locked me out!

36:40.520 --> 36:42.010
What? I can't hear you.
What happened?

36:42.080 --> 36:43.206
Evan, quit playing.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.362
I am freezing out here,
and I'm in my underwear.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.882
Oh! I'm sorry.
It must have been an accident.

36:47.960 --> 36:52.045
Evan. Evan!
I'm melting!

36:52.120 --> 36:53.884
Evan! Evan!

36:57.200 --> 36:59.089
Happy Kwanzaa, Mrs. Olakanday.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.481
Mmm-hmm.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.690
Evan! Evan! Evan!

37:06.400 --> 37:07.481
Okay.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.161
Oh!

37:28.240 --> 37:29.241
No!

37:29.320 --> 37:31.322
Evan, come on. Evan?

37:31.400 --> 37:35.450
Come on. Evan? Evan! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.091
You're not an accident.
Evan, don't be like this.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.606
Don't be like this.
God does not like ugly, Evan.

37:40.680 --> 37:41.920
Evan, please.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.446
Please, please. Come on!

37:45.200 --> 37:47.407
Twigs. You need some help?

37:47.480 --> 37:48.561
No, I'm fine.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.923
Is there a reason you have a
tattoo that says "sesame chicken"?

37:54.040 --> 37:55.496
It does not say
"sesame chicken," okay?

37:55.520 --> 37:56.560
If you were more cultured,

37:56.600 --> 37:58.720
you would know that it says
"Unbreakable" in Mandarin.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.809
Well, I actually took Mandarin
for a semester in college,

38:01.880 --> 38:03.803
I'm pretty sure it says
"sesame chicken."

38:03.880 --> 38:05.291
Stop looking at my ass.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.362
You know what? You're right.

38:07.760 --> 38:08.886
You got it.

38:08.960 --> 38:12.123
I think it says, "Free fortune
cookie with delivery."

38:13.440 --> 38:14.680
Really?

38:14.840 --> 38:16.016
Let me try to get you
out of here.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.202
No! No, no, no.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.656
It's not that kind of party! Okay?
It's not that kind of party.

38:20.680 --> 38:23.047
Let me use two hands. I just...
Get from behind me!

38:23.120 --> 38:25.009
No! No!

38:28.680 --> 38:31.047
Get... Get from behind me! No!
Just...

38:31.240 --> 38:33.288
Hold on.
Back up off of my butt!

38:33.880 --> 38:35.723
No! No! No!

38:36.200 --> 38:37.486
There you go.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.164
You okay?
Yeah. I'm good.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.765
What's wrong with you?
I'm good. Okay?

38:42.720 --> 38:43.926
I got it.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.481
You Okay?

38:49.480 --> 38:51.209
Evan, I'm going to kill you!

38:55.240 --> 38:57.129
Phew! Everybody
got everything?

38:57.200 --> 38:58.281
Hey, Mom.
Hey.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.441
Hey, Aunt Rachel.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.124
Look who's up!
How was your morning?

39:01.200 --> 39:02.201
Don't ask.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.805
Hey, baby girl.
Hey.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.365
We got a lot of food.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.930
I see this.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.970
I swear, if I close my eyes,

39:10.080 --> 39:12.924
I can almost see her in here
like it was yesterday.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.401
The thought of having Christmas
dinner without her...

39:15.520 --> 39:17.216
Thought of cooking Christmas
dinner without her...

39:17.240 --> 39:19.129
She was a great cook.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.770
Guess it runs in the family.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.246
You need a cough drop, baby?

39:23.680 --> 39:25.682
It's a shame
we can't find her recipes.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.689
- Where are they?
- Who knows?

39:27.800 --> 39:30.121
She stashed them in a tin
around here somewhere.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.201
That's right.
You know,

39:31.280 --> 39:34.921
I saw her make those recipes a
million times. I should know them.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.200
I just always thought
she'd be here.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.571
She is here.

39:39.880 --> 39:43.487
She's in every pot,
in every pan, every cabinet,

39:44.120 --> 39:45.565
and every drawer.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.644
We are all standing
on holy ground.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.371
This is the Church of Grace.

39:51.480 --> 39:55.724
Y'all didn't hear me?
This is the Church of Grace!

39:55.800 --> 39:58.246
Hallelujah!

39:58.320 --> 40:00.527
In the Church of Grace,
we need music.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.936
Let's get that music, Miss Niya.
Thank you, Jesus!

40:02.960 --> 40:03.960
Let's do it!

40:04.000 --> 40:05.729
Put your music on, Miss Niya.
Here we go.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.490
Let's see what
you gonna work with.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.090
This is not church dancing!

40:12.160 --> 40:14.162
Don't you get down!
Don't you get down!

40:14.760 --> 40:15.761
Come on, Mom.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.161
Give it to 'em.
Show 'em what you got.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.976
All right, Aunt May. Show Aunt
May what you're working with.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.400
What do y'all know
about this stuff?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.530
You got my jam!

40:29.040 --> 40:31.884
Sonya, you better get your
titties off my back, girl,

40:31.960 --> 40:33.769
with your non-dancing ass!

40:33.840 --> 40:34.921
Right here.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.206
Cheryl! Cheryl!
Do our routine!

40:37.680 --> 40:39.045
Wait, let me get my shoes off!

40:44.760 --> 40:46.444
That's it!
Okay, that's enough of that.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.726
We got it.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.365
What? What?

40:49.520 --> 40:51.966
Let Aunt May play
some real music.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.731
Okay, there go mine.
Remember that? Remember that?

40:55.800 --> 40:58.136
Remember, Aunt May taught y'all
that when y'all was little girls?

40:58.160 --> 41:00.003
Remember that? Come on.
What you got?

41:00.960 --> 41:02.962
Bring it back. Bring it back.
Now take it low.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.804
What? What? Now pop that.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.291
All right.
I'm doing second round.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.209
- Come on. Come on.
- Here we go.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.930
Now, take it back. Come on.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.002
Bring it back. Come on.
Pump that.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.801
Remember? Step! Bring it up.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.125
Here it goes!

41:20.360 --> 41:21.486
There it goes!

41:21.560 --> 41:23.210
Now, take it back!

41:23.360 --> 41:24.486
Come on, Aunt May.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.730
Wait, Aunt May,
you been drinking again?

41:28.840 --> 41:30.416
Join us, Pop-pop.
You gotta move it.

41:30.440 --> 41:31.646
Daddy, Daddy!

41:31.720 --> 41:34.087
Come on, Walter.
Bring your old ass in here.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.920
Go, Daddy. Go, Daddy.
Go, Daddy.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.129
Get 'em, Pop! Show 'em!

41:46.720 --> 41:48.449
Push, Lonnie. Dang!

41:48.600 --> 41:50.090
Push with your legs.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.366
Y'all did it.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.489
That's the biggest tree
I've ever seen.

41:55.560 --> 41:56.686
We've had bigger, sweetie.

41:56.760 --> 41:57.807
Yeah!

41:57.880 --> 42:00.042
Like the year Mom
let Evan pick the tree.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.363
It was so big we had to saw off the
top just to get it in the house.

42:04.440 --> 42:06.442
What did you do with
the other half you sawed off?

42:06.520 --> 42:09.444
We stood it up next to the bigger half.
We had two trees that year.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.965
You're welcome, by the way.

42:11.040 --> 42:14.089
Like your mother always said,
"The bigger the tree..."

42:14.200 --> 42:15.964
"The bigger the love!"

42:19.120 --> 42:20.121
Man.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.081
Yeah.

42:24.720 --> 42:28.566
Look here. I'm going to go into the
garage and get the ornaments. Okay?

42:28.640 --> 42:29.721
You need some help, Daddy?

42:29.800 --> 42:32.485
I'm all right, sweetie.
All right.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.296
All right, y'all. Well, let's
bring this thing to life.

42:34.320 --> 42:35.936
Yes. Christian, go get
some water for the tree.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.804
I can't. I gotta go meet
Brooks in town square.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.605
Well, the kids would love to go
to town square and meet Santa.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.728
Come on, y'all. Let's do this.
All right, have fun.

42:43.800 --> 42:46.256
All right, Evan, baby. Get a broom
so we can get up these pine needles.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.456
I can't. I told Eric that I'ma
hang with him for a little bit.

42:48.480 --> 42:49.925
But you love
decorating the tree.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.765
I know. But when y'all
mess up, then I get to fix it.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.616
Don't be chasing
them fast-ass girls.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.563
- Nah. Bye, y'all.
- Be careful, baby.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.096
Now, Rachel and Cheryl,
do y'all think

42:58.120 --> 42:59.696
y'all can go in the kitchen
and put something together?

42:59.720 --> 43:01.136
Some snacks,
without killing each other?

43:01.160 --> 43:02.286
Yes.
I appreciate that.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.200
Y'all go on and be
big girls for Aunt May.

43:04.880 --> 43:05.961
Depending on y'all.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.496
And, Lonnie, I'm going to need you
to get me the dustpan and the broom

43:08.520 --> 43:09.936
so you can help me
get up these pine needles.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.008
Okay. We'll get 'em up.
Thank you.

43:12.120 --> 43:14.441
But let me tell you something.
What?

43:14.520 --> 43:16.602
I love how your hair
just drapes your face.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.364
It just like...

43:18.440 --> 43:19.771
You know, you feathered it.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.367
And it's just so nice how it just, you
know, shapes your face real nice.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.496
Thank you, Lonnie. I appreciate that.
Take care of yourself.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.760
Thank you. Yes, indeed.

43:26.840 --> 43:31.289
It's like you did a big-ass
peach and a big-ass wig

43:31.360 --> 43:34.603
and you put that wig on top of that
peach, and you drape it the same way.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.728
Lonnie, go on, boy.

43:36.880 --> 43:39.256
I don't feel like you right now.
Get you on. All right, all right.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.009
Let me get that broom.
Get on!

43:54.800 --> 43:57.406
<i>Which tree do you think
we should take home, Evan?</i>

43:57.480 --> 43:58.720
This one?

43:59.120 --> 44:01.566
<i>I want this one, Mommy.</i>

44:01.640 --> 44:04.484
<i>Perfect. Just like you.</i>

44:24.520 --> 44:26.010
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>

44:26.080 --> 44:28.082
What up, fam?
Come on, Santa Claus!

44:28.160 --> 44:29.810
Time to go get
them ho, ho, ho's.

44:29.880 --> 44:32.770
Good to see you, boy. You
always shining like a little...

44:32.840 --> 44:34.490
God damn!
What's that? Soul Glo?

44:34.560 --> 44:36.085
Man, beauty supply store.
Aisle two.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.488
I'm up here way too high.
Hang on. There it is.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.329
Hold up. Boy, you ain't cool enough.
What?

44:41.440 --> 44:43.400
Come on, baby. You ain't
going to leave me behind.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.016
Come on, now.
Who do you think taught you?

44:45.040 --> 44:46.610
You ready?
I'm ready. Let's go.

44:46.680 --> 44:47.976
Hold on, I'm gonna put
my seat belt on.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.096
Because we all know
you can't drive.

44:49.120 --> 44:52.044
Let's get it. You know
what I'm saying?

44:53.600 --> 44:55.536
Okay... Daddy!
Can we go see Santa, Daddy?

44:55.560 --> 44:56.561
Huh?

44:56.640 --> 44:58.130
Can we go see Santa?

44:58.200 --> 44:59.201
Santa?

44:59.280 --> 45:02.204
You know, 75% of all sidewalk
Santa's have Hepatitis C.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.362
Don't put your fingers
in his beard.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.807
Thank you for that
very fun fact, Brooks.

45:06.880 --> 45:08.256
Look, baby, soon
as Daddy's done here,

45:08.280 --> 45:10.176
I'm going to take you to do
whatever you want to do, okay?

45:10.200 --> 45:11.690
Like that's going to happen.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.842
Come on. I'll take you. Okay.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.410
He gets that from his mother.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.289
Let's take a walk.

45:17.440 --> 45:20.171
We just lost Van Kirk.
He's supporting Baxter.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.321
What?

45:22.320 --> 45:25.130
Our biggest donor
just backed out? Wow.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.241
Politics.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.526
Yeah, so what do we do now?

45:27.600 --> 45:30.251
Well, the Brigham Group is
still looking for a way to...

45:30.320 --> 45:31.367
Control our campaign.

45:31.440 --> 45:32.440
No.
Yeah.

45:32.480 --> 45:33.561
To support you...
Not me.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.336
Because they believe in
your vision to invest in you.

45:35.360 --> 45:38.536
No, what they believe in is that if we win,
they're the first in line for a favor.

45:38.560 --> 45:41.404
Their last favor
downsized a factory!

45:41.520 --> 45:44.364
1,500 people out of work! Their
last candidate is now a senator.

45:44.440 --> 45:46.408
Andy Brooks, just, please.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.096
I'm an adult.
Just tell me what they want.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.610
It's not even a done deal yet.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.808
We will talk more about this
after the interview.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.526
What interview?

45:53.680 --> 45:57.401
<i>We are here with congressional
candidate Christian Meyers.</i>

45:57.520 --> 45:58.936
<i>New poll numbers show...
Christian's on</i> TV!

45:58.960 --> 46:00.216
<i>- That you really have</i>
a <i>good chance-</i> What?

46:00.240 --> 46:01.416
<i>Yeah, but we will not stop</i>

46:01.440 --> 46:02.800
<i>until the last vote is in.</i>
My <i>gosh!</i>

46:03.520 --> 46:06.760
Politics aside, how are you enjoying being
home for the holidays with your family?

46:07.000 --> 46:09.207
Daddy! Daddy!
It's Christian! Hurry!

46:10.160 --> 46:12.527
Hey! That's the tie
I bought him!

46:12.680 --> 46:13.920
Move, Cheryl. Move!
Geez Louise!

46:14.040 --> 46:15.456
<i>And the other highlight
is Santa Claus.</i>

46:15.480 --> 46:17.369
<i>Have you had a chance
to sit on his lap yet?</i>

46:17.440 --> 46:18.840
<i>No, I'm leaving that up
to the kids.</i>

46:19.360 --> 46:21.283
If you did sit on Santa's lap,

46:21.360 --> 46:23.656
I'm sure everyone at home would love
to know what you would ask for.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.409
Ask for a suit that fits.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.456
Because he going to mess around
and get a yeast infection.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.496
May! And that cream
don't work on men, Cheryl.

46:29.520 --> 46:30.931
You used to keep
a yeast infection.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.331
Aunt May!
That itching, burning...

46:32.400 --> 46:34.129
It didn't do good for you.

46:34.200 --> 46:36.487
They ain't Instagram
models, but they a'ight.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.096
'Cause anytime you ask them to do
something, they gonna be like, "A'ight."

46:39.120 --> 46:41.376
Put some gas in the car. "A'ight."
Pour my bath water. "A'ight."

46:41.400 --> 46:43.084
I don't even take baths.
I take showers.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.161
What can I get for you?

46:44.280 --> 46:45.361
Everything.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.889
Can I get
the chili cheese bacon burger?

46:48.000 --> 46:49.411
And can I get some fries?

46:49.480 --> 46:50.936
And can you please tell them
to make it crispy.

46:50.960 --> 46:53.656
I need to hear the
when I eat. You know what I'm saying?

46:53.680 --> 46:55.887
And can I get a milkshake?

46:56.480 --> 46:57.527
With extra whipped cream.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.216
Because last time,
they forgot my whipped cream.

46:59.240 --> 47:00.896
So I'm going to need
my last time whipped cream

47:00.920 --> 47:02.922
and this time whipped cream,
and some apple pie.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.490
Can I just get a chicken breast,

47:04.560 --> 47:06.376
side of asparagus,
and some brown rice, please?

47:06.400 --> 47:07.526
Absolutely.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.289
Everything's coming right up, baby.
Okay.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.169
All right, baby.
You got mine? Baby?

47:11.240 --> 47:14.687
Baby, baby, baby! I heard you
1 O times already. Okay!

47:14.760 --> 47:16.016
Obviously you didn't.
A bag of sugar.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.336
<i>A</i> bag of sugar.
Two sticks of butter.

47:17.360 --> 47:18.816
<i>Two sticks of butter.
And some vanilla extract.</i>

47:18.840 --> 47:20.080
<i>Don't forget, Lonnie.</i>

47:20.200 --> 47:22.136
<i>And the vanilla wafers, and
bananas...</i> I'ma call <i>you</i> back.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.889
Call you back!

47:24.040 --> 47:25.320
Let me give you
a hand with that.

47:25.760 --> 47:26.761
Oh! See that?

47:26.840 --> 47:29.969
I'm used to putting my hands up like that.
Crashing the boards.

47:30.040 --> 47:32.850
I know a little bit
about boxing out, myself.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.843
Okay. You play basketball?

47:34.920 --> 47:36.206
I did.

47:36.280 --> 47:37.884
I did. What about you?

47:38.720 --> 47:40.085
You know, a little bit.

47:41.400 --> 47:42.481
Who hasn't?

47:43.560 --> 47:44.971
Lonnie Maclay?

47:47.120 --> 47:50.727
My dad is a huge
Seattle SuperSonics fan.

47:50.800 --> 47:51.847
Wow.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.161
I remember game four,

47:54.600 --> 47:57.285
1991, game-winning shot.

47:57.360 --> 47:59.966
You remember?
You saw that game?

48:00.120 --> 48:01.565
Did I?

48:01.640 --> 48:04.041
We wore green
for like a week straight!

48:04.120 --> 48:05.963
Wow.
Shatao!

48:07.120 --> 48:08.963
Don't tell me you know
about "shatao."

48:09.040 --> 48:11.407
I know all about "shatao."

48:12.240 --> 48:13.241
Wow.

48:13.560 --> 48:17.326
I don't think anyone's going to
believe that I actually met you.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.164
Would you mind
if I take a selfie?

48:19.240 --> 48:22.244
If you know about "shatao," you can
take as many photos <i>as</i> you want.

48:22.320 --> 48:23.321
Okay.

48:28.160 --> 48:30.128
Love that!
Can we take another?

48:30.200 --> 48:31.326
Funny face.
Okay.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.129
All right, you ready? Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.162
Love that!
Let me see.

48:40.240 --> 48:41.765
That's great!
Right?

48:41.840 --> 48:44.081
You know what? I would love
a copy of that picture.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.446
Yeah.

48:45.680 --> 48:47.216
You want to put
your number in my phone?

48:47.240 --> 48:48.616
And I'll just send it
to you when I get off?

48:48.640 --> 48:50.802
Okay, I'll put my number.
Okay, put it in.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.370
My number in here.

48:52.920 --> 48:56.288
I would love to put
this photo on my fan wall.

48:56.440 --> 48:58.761
Especially someone
as beautiful as you.

48:59.520 --> 49:00.681
That's me.

49:02.360 --> 49:03.361
I got it.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.685
So, I'll send it.

49:05.760 --> 49:07.364
You better send it.

49:07.440 --> 49:08.521
I will.

49:08.840 --> 49:11.127
But you're not going
to get me fired. Okay.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.924
It's a pleasure
meeting you, Lonnie.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.136
<i>Attention, all shoppers.</i>

49:15.160 --> 49:18.243
<i>Special holiday savings today
with your Clubs Card.</i>

49:18.320 --> 49:20.322
Pleasure's all mine.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.166
Twigs!

49:23.400 --> 49:24.686
Twigs! Hold up!

49:25.960 --> 49:27.200
Cool!

49:27.280 --> 49:29.203
Workout partner for the week.

49:29.480 --> 49:32.131
I missed the last three days.
Had to double up.

49:32.200 --> 49:33.440
How far do you usually run?

49:33.520 --> 49:35.727
A lot farther when people
aren't talking to me.

49:35.800 --> 49:38.565
Me, I love the company.
Helps the time go by.

49:38.680 --> 49:40.409
I don't. It distracts me.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.641
Girl, I swear, you haven't
changed one bit.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.561
Except for this jogging thing.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.085
Looks good on you.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.924
And neighborhood's looking good.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.480
I gotta say, your pops did a real
good job fixing up the house.

49:54.560 --> 49:57.848
Okay, what part of "it's
distracting" don't you understand?

49:59.200 --> 50:01.806
Probably the same part of
"there's a cicada in your hair"

50:01.880 --> 50:03.325
that you don't understand.

50:03.520 --> 50:07.809
Get it! Get it! Get it!

50:07.880 --> 50:09.041
Have a good rest of the day.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.167
Get it! Get it! Get it!

50:11.920 --> 50:13.570
Get it Off!

50:16.600 --> 50:18.443
Did you find everything
you need?

50:20.240 --> 50:25.007
Sometimes you find things that
you're not even looking for.

50:26.120 --> 50:27.121
Crazy.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.045
I seen your interview, E.

50:30.120 --> 50:31.167
What interview?

50:31.240 --> 50:32.321
The one on ESPN.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.280
They said your shoulder
was good. You all right?

50:35.440 --> 50:36.771
Yeah.

50:36.840 --> 50:38.171
Coach is...

50:38.240 --> 50:41.483
He's trying to get me to stay on these
pills for like another week or two.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.165
I just forgot to get my
prescription filled before I left.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.496
You think your boy
can get me some?

50:46.520 --> 50:48.443
Who? Lil' Discount?
Mmm-hmm.

50:48.520 --> 50:49.567
Man. He good.

50:49.640 --> 50:52.530
Got your suits, pills,
negative pregnancy results.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.642
Listen, the baby is not yours.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.924
Ask him if he can get these.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.091
My man can do it all, bro.
I got you.

51:03.160 --> 51:04.400
I'ma to talk to him for you.

51:04.480 --> 51:05.561
Thanks, man.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.326
Oh, God.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.086
I found her!

51:13.120 --> 51:14.724
Hey!
Hey.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.371
Who's Munchie?

51:26.000 --> 51:30.164
His name is Malachi, and we used
to be friends in high school.

51:30.240 --> 51:32.200
Then why didn't you let him
help us with the bags?

51:32.240 --> 51:34.891
Because first they help you
with your bags

51:34.960 --> 51:37.376
and next thing you know, they're
taking somebody else to prom.

51:37.400 --> 51:40.131
Mom, can I tell you something?

51:40.240 --> 51:41.765
And not get in trouble for it?

51:42.520 --> 51:43.521
What?

51:43.800 --> 51:45.370
Am I going to get in trouble?

51:45.440 --> 51:46.441
Probably.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.450
You're an attractive woman.

51:48.520 --> 51:52.161
You have a lot to offer a guy but
you gotta stop running them off.

51:52.520 --> 51:53.616
I'm not running anybody off.

51:53.640 --> 51:54.687
Really?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.446
Remember my gym teacher, Mr.
Harrison? Yeah.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.761
He said you were beautiful.
He said he loved your hair.

51:59.840 --> 52:02.764
And you said, "So if I was bald,
I wouldn't be beautiful?"

52:02.840 --> 52:07.164
No. See, I just don't think a woman's
beauty should be defined by her hair.

52:07.240 --> 52:08.730
Well, what about
the gas station?

52:08.800 --> 52:11.136
It was storming, and that really
cute guy asked to pump our gas.

52:11.160 --> 52:12.525
And I let him.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.681
Well, yeah.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.808
Until he hit regular unleaded,
and you said,

52:15.880 --> 52:18.451
"So a black woman
can't afford premium?"

52:18.520 --> 52:19.520
Exactly.

52:19.560 --> 52:22.450
You had to pump your gas in the
rain while it ruined your hair.

52:22.520 --> 52:24.249
I was getting my hair done
the next day.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.766
Mom, you're missing the point.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.410
Men aren't that smart.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.840
So we have to trick them into
thinking things are their idea

52:30.880 --> 52:32.006
when it's really ours.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.136
Like Brandon, my boyfriend.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.241
I'm sorry.

52:35.760 --> 52:36.921
You have a boyfriend?

52:37.000 --> 52:38.126
Mom, stay focused.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.656
I don't like carrying
my bag all the time.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.921
So when Brandon's around, I
act like it hurts my shoulder

52:42.000 --> 52:43.240
and he carries it for me.

52:43.320 --> 52:45.376
He gets to be a hero, and I
don't have to carry my bag.

52:45.400 --> 52:46.560
When did you get a boyfriend?

52:46.840 --> 52:48.285
Focus, Mom.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.001
Trust me.

52:50.080 --> 52:53.801
Life's a whole lot easier when there's
someone to help carry the load.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.608
Even if you can
carry it yourself.

53:04.760 --> 53:07.136
People want jobs, and
small businesses want capital.

53:07.160 --> 53:09.056
It's not enough to create
centers for small businesses.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.844
We have to pool...

53:10.920 --> 53:13.651
We have to cultivate resources.

53:13.760 --> 53:16.491
Pop. Hey, morning! Morning!
Morning!

53:16.560 --> 53:18.256
I'm gonna whip up some pancakes here.
You want some?

53:18.280 --> 53:21.648
No, I'm trying to lay off them
processed carbs right now.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.246
Yeah.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.642
I cannot tell you how excited we
were watching you on TV yesterday.

53:31.640 --> 53:35.008
You know, it's not often

53:36.480 --> 53:42.044
the son of an old mechanic becomes
a United States congressman.

53:42.120 --> 53:44.885
You own six auto shops, Pop.

53:44.960 --> 53:46.803
And I do have
to win the election first.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.644
It's only a formality.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.164
Hey, your mother...

53:53.400 --> 53:58.645
She would have turned this whole house
into your campaign headquarters.

53:58.720 --> 53:59.846
Yep-

54:00.720 --> 54:02.768
She'd have been so proud of you.

54:06.480 --> 54:09.450
You know, maybe you can say a few
words at the shelter this year.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.568
I mean, hearing
from a future congressman

54:12.160 --> 54:15.209
would make the year
even more special.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.171
I'd love to.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.161
Hey!

54:24.160 --> 54:25.844
Oh! Buddy.

54:27.640 --> 54:29.688
You ain't worried about me
embarrassing you?

54:30.480 --> 54:33.211
Whoo! Here we go.

54:34.600 --> 54:36.568
I thought we supposed
to be playing some football.

54:36.680 --> 54:38.489
Come on, old man. Let's go!

54:39.600 --> 54:41.523
Who you talking to?

54:41.600 --> 54:43.841
Hey. Come on, old man.

54:44.520 --> 54:45.681
Hut! Hike!

54:48.040 --> 54:49.041
Here I come!

54:50.880 --> 54:52.450
Get him, son. Get him!

54:53.200 --> 54:55.885
This is great.
Quality family time.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.486
A beautiful day. Beautiful day.
Yes, it is.

54:58.560 --> 55:00.130
They gonna kill
each other out there.

55:02.280 --> 55:03.884
- Block!
- Look at the old man!

55:04.840 --> 55:06.490
Here! Right here!
Throw the ball!

55:06.560 --> 55:08.056
- Lonnie, heads up!
- Nice catch, Lonnie.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.162
That's how
they did it in Croatia.

55:10.240 --> 55:12.129
What's up with those
pink pants, Malibu Barbie?

55:12.200 --> 55:13.576
I left mine at home.
These are Cheryl's.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.329
Yeah. No, we all believe that.

55:19.800 --> 55:20.801
I'm down.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.081
First down for me.
It's touch!

55:22.160 --> 55:24.288
Get off my sister, man.
I got you.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.686
I was down, Lonnie!

55:30.080 --> 55:31.570
Cheryl, that's how you do it.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.001
Whoo!
What are y'all doing?

55:34.080 --> 55:37.050
I taught you that!
I taught you that, baby.

55:37.120 --> 55:38.804
We got skills over here.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.680
Hey, Aunt May.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.607
That's for you, baby.
She don't want you!

55:44.160 --> 55:46.162
Uh-oh!
Somebody got a boyfriend!

55:46.440 --> 55:49.489
They'd make an excellent couple.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.609
I got vibrators
older than that child.

55:55.080 --> 55:57.128
Go, baby! Go, baby!

55:57.280 --> 55:58.725
Rachel, stop trying to pump him.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.882
What's all this freaking
going on? Come on!

56:01.080 --> 56:02.570
What are you doing?

56:02.720 --> 56:04.529
Cameron, don't you want to play?

56:04.680 --> 56:07.604
Is it better to be
on the team or own it?

56:10.120 --> 56:11.121
Where's the flag?

56:11.200 --> 56:12.576
Get your ass up, boy.
Come on. Get up, boy.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.931
Come on, Ev.
Damn!

56:19.080 --> 56:20.127
'Got it!

56:20.200 --> 56:21.247
What was that, Lonnie?

56:21.320 --> 56:22.810
Evan! Evan! Don't!

56:22.920 --> 56:24.856
What the hell was that? You tripped him!
What are you doing?

56:24.880 --> 56:26.006
Lonnie, don't!

56:26.760 --> 56:28.603
World Star!

56:28.760 --> 56:30.569
Lonnie, have you lost your damn mind?
Lonnie!

56:30.640 --> 56:32.120
- Lonnie!
- Wait a minute!

56:32.800 --> 56:34.040
Man, you saw where I was going!

56:34.080 --> 56:35.570
You gonna try to trip me?
Stop it!

56:35.640 --> 56:37.085
You had to trip him?

56:37.160 --> 56:38.571
That's his career!

56:38.640 --> 56:40.369
Not your dumb, made up one!

56:40.440 --> 56:41.616
Really?
What's that, right there?

56:41.640 --> 56:43.244
What is that?
Everyone knows

56:43.320 --> 56:45.527
you go overseas when you
don't make it in the NBA.

56:45.600 --> 56:46.886
You're a joke!

56:46.960 --> 56:49.566
Oh. At least he had a career,
Miss Teacher-Veterinarian.

56:49.640 --> 56:50.766
Or is it attorney now?

56:50.840 --> 56:52.888
Which, given the salary
of a divorced, single mom

56:52.960 --> 56:55.088
working graveyard shifts
at the Waffle House,

56:55.160 --> 56:57.003
will take till 2050 to afford.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.764
Rachel, Cheryl! Okay.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.971
Okay, game's over!
Game's over.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.845
Good game! Good game!
Good game! Yeah!

57:04.920 --> 57:06.604
Good game. Let's go get...

57:06.680 --> 57:08.444
Let's go get dinner. Okay?

57:08.520 --> 57:10.522
As long as
it's not Waffle House.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.250
The hell is wrong with him?

57:14.760 --> 57:17.923
Go ahead. I got the baby.
Come on, babies.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.684
I got y'all. Come on. Come on.

57:23.040 --> 57:25.691
We were doing so well.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.045
You were great, Mom.

57:40.280 --> 57:42.442
Yeah, man. I'm all right.
I almost whooped that...

57:42.560 --> 57:44.642
We almost whooped his ass.

57:44.720 --> 57:46.006
Yo, you got that
for me, or what?

57:46.080 --> 57:47.605
Yeah, I got it.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.201
Yes!

57:50.320 --> 57:51.924
Damn, man!
I didn't need this many!

57:52.040 --> 57:53.883
No, a couple of 'em SweeTARTS.

57:57.480 --> 57:58.976
Come on, Christian.
Just hear me out.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.129
This is exactly why I said I didn't
want them to back my campaign!

58:02.200 --> 58:04.965
They just blow into town and start
steamrolling over small businesses.

58:05.040 --> 58:07.840
No, they blow into town, and they
turn state senators into congressmen.

58:07.880 --> 58:10.281
This is not good!
I can't do this!

58:10.360 --> 58:11.576
I think you're
over thinking this.

58:11.600 --> 58:12.656
They're just going
to go downtown.

58:12.680 --> 58:15.176
They're going to turn some old, shitty
buildings into beautiful lofts.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.964
What's the problem?
My mom.

58:17.280 --> 58:20.011
The homeless shelter
is in the district.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.684
It meant a lot to my mom.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.681
Look, after you're elected,

58:26.760 --> 58:28.416
you're going to rebuild
that homeless shelter.

58:28.440 --> 58:31.046
And it's going to be beautiful.
Your mother would love it.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.963
Andy Brooks,

58:33.040 --> 58:35.884
no announcement
until after the holidays.

58:40.920 --> 58:41.921
Fine.

58:50.440 --> 58:51.965
Hey, Lonnie.

58:53.120 --> 58:54.963
Can I get some help in the back?

59:46.680 --> 59:48.011
Hmm!

59:48.520 --> 59:50.010
No, you didn't.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.241
Ooh!

59:54.760 --> 59:56.000
Sorry.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.081
Rachel.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.206
Rachel Meyers.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.600
Do we know each other?

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.722
Jasmine.
Chloe's little sister.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.729
From high school.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.848
Yeah, right!
Right. How is she?

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.531
She's good. She's coaching
women's basketball at Kansas.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.840
Nice!
Yeah.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.127
Wow! You look the same.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.009
Like no time passed.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.167
How have you been?

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.370
Seem to be blowing up
over there.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.041
Boyfriend?

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.201
Um...

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.171
He just invited me to Chicago
for the weekend.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.124
Must be nice.
$8.49.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.731
He can't get enough of you.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.525
Do you mind?

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.011
He's so cute.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.929
Look how perfect
we are together.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.726
Shit.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.404
That's what I said.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.886
Want to see another?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.411
Um... Oh!

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.610
Yeah. Confirmation
of your love.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.046
I was hoping I wouldn't have
to spend Christmas alone.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.000
But he's got to take care
of his Grandma Cheryl.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.441
She's really old.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.841
Yeah.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.449
I had an old
Grandma Cheryl once.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.443
She was a mean, old bitch.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.207
You said you were going
to be alone on Christmas?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.331
Yeah.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.890
You don't have to be.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.610
I don't?
Nope.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.041
Our family has
so much love to give.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.525
Obviously.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.965
That's what's up.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.920
Some game, huh?

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.401
Yeah.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.562
Hey, don't worry
about what your sister said.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.721
Being single isn't bad.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.040
Thanks. Feel a lot better.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.527
What is wrong with you?

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.441
You know, nothing.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.923
Except that you keep trying to act
like we're cool when we're not.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.569
Why aren't we cool?
Really?

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.925
Belinda "Big teeth"?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.047
Who?

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.521
Your prom date? Horse face?

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.881
Her teeth weren't really that big.
She had a small mouth.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.896
And, okay, I took her to the prom.
What's the big problem?

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.496
You took her to the prom!
That's the problem.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.409
After you canceled on me
at the last minute.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.970
Like you even wanted
to go with me!

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.724
Why do you think
I asked you to go?

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.686
I heard him.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.610
Heard who?
Your dumb jock friend.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.968
He was laughing about how easy it would
be for the star basketball player

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.964
to take his nerdy next-door
neighbor to bed that night.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.281
I heard him. And you just
let him talk about me.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.203
You didn't say anything!

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.246
You're right. I didn't.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.243
And neither did he
after I broke his nose.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.884
That's how Damien
broke his nose?

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.804
You would have known if you weren't
such a dramatic little princess.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.009
You would have known why I canceled
if you weren't such a dumb jock.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.176
Wouldn't have mattered anyway

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.200
'cause there wouldn't have been enough
room in the limo for the three of us.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.480
The three of us?
Yeah.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.971
Me, you, and your ego.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.129
Oh. We'd have fit.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.800
Because your low self-esteem doesn't
take up too much real estate.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.530
You know what?
I'm glad we didn't go.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.001
That makes two of us. It
would've been a terrible night.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.161
Worst prom ever.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.163
Absolute worst!

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.409
It would have been
a horrible night.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.881
Awful.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.121
Ooh!

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.560
Okay. Here.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.127
Aunt May, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.170
Hold it. Aunt May
is in concert, baby.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.720
You don't interrupt
Aunt May's concerts.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.362
Just hold it
a little longer, Cam.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.565
Is Cameron all right?

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.802
That food is still running
through him.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.002
<i>Heaven and nature sing</i>

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.891
<i>Heaven and nature sing</i>

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.050
I've been sipping!

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.525
This is good to me.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.601
Ah!

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.927
Come on.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.048
It's getting me up
outta my seat!

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.680
You feel that?

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.161
You sound beautiful, Aunt May.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.448
I'm gonna go ahead
and let Cameron sip some.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.091
Hell no.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.001
Double the temperature,

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.891
half the time.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.087
Boom!

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.362
<i>You've got to finish strong, baby.</i>

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.616
<i>I haven't even done
my small business speech yet.</i>

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.244
That's our "Yes, We Can" speech.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.656
I don't know what's in that
speech, but just keep saying it

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.364
because you're now
the growth candidate.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.807
That means
that you are going to be...

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.927
What the hell is this?

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.896
The rezoning's going to happen
with or without me, Pop.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.736
They don't need my support.
Our prime purpose in life...

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.976
If I plan to get into office, I
need theirs... is to help others.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.056
If you can't help them, at the
very least, don't hurt them.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.216
But if I do not get elected into
office, how can I help, Pop?

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.447
Great progress
requires great sacrifice.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.085
Did you come up
with that yourself?

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.003
Or did your campaign manager
write it for you?

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.129
People figure it out, Pop.
They always figure it out.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.885
Your mother was seven years
old when your aunt was born.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.096
Pop, please don't bring
Mom into this.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.009
Your grandparents
were having a tough time

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.971
and having another mouth to
feed didn't make it any easier.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.248
They ended up losing their home.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.050
And moving into a shelter.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.765
That shelter.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.281
That's why it was
so important to her.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.201
So the next time you talk
about people figuring it out,

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.641
remember, one of those people
was your mother.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.886
Oh, my God!

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.200
What the hell?

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.449
My macaroni and cheese!

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.887
It was going to be disgusting.
I did you a favor.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.571
Well, then do me a damn favor.
Don't burn down the damn house!

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.687
'Got it!

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.886
Damn!
Lonnie!

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.721
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.564
What the hell did you all do?

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.336
And you done sprayed some shit
on me, Lonnie?

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.408
I ought to whip your ass.
You raise your goddamn...

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.686
Shut up!

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.406
You can't afford to buy me
no more outfits like this.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.726
This my damn Chaka Khan.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.325
Chaka Khan. Chaka Khan!

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.647
Five days.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.528
I knew it was going to be tough.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:22.846
But I said, "Surely the
children she loved so much

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.446
"and damn near gave her life for

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.604
"would find a way
to make it work."

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.564
Obviously, I was wrong.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.165
And disappointed.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:40.926
I expect you all
will clean this up.

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:48.444
I'll tell you what. I'll be the better
man between the both of us. Okay?

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.845
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.040
You going to be the better man
between the both of us?

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.923
There! Messed up
my damn Chaka Khan wig.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.176
You see what happened just now?
Do you see what happened?

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.536
You don't do that to a man!

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.496
That wasn't no man I did it to.
Here, you take this rag.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.536
You old big-lipped son of a bitch.
You take that one.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.607
Good luck.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.444
No. Don't even try, Christian.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.856
I'm not the one who tried to
deep-fry the whole kitchen, am I?

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.850
No. And I don't think I was making the
blackeroni and cheese over there.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.529
So I think we should just go.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.055
You want some pizza
and wings or something?

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.376
You know I gotta watch
my carbs, right?

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.447
That's fine.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.576
They got that high school cheerleader
menu you can order from.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.840
Shut up, dude.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.160
It's all good.
Right?

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.729
Okay, I'm done.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.081
Great!

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.366
So now, I can remake
the macaroni you ruined.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:51.091
No. I'm going to make
the dressing you ruined.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.249
Rachel, you're being ridiculous.
No. I need to get my stuff.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.845
Rachel, stop.
You always do this.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.166
I need all this.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.526
Why are you taking my stuff?

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.602
I need the noodles.
No.I need...

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.485
Oh, my God.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.161
Oh.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.406
Mom's fried chicken.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.324
"Always use
a cast iron skillet."

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.816
That's why mine
never turned out right.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.285
Yeah, she did.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.764
Buttermilk biscuits.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.844
Christian would kill for this.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.002
And Brooks would kill us.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.764
Let's give it to him.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.171
Carbs!

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.488
Her collard green recipe.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.291
Smoked turkey necks,
half a cup of sugar,

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.283
and a pinch of bugs.
Bugs.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.326
So amazing.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.244
Did you find
the sweet potato pie recipe?

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.370
Oh, God. Mom made it so often I
don't even think she wrote it down.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.769
Look at this.
Wow.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.321
Aw!

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.726
I think I'm going
to go outside for a minute.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.006
<i>What's up? It's your girl,
Jazz. Leave a message.</i>

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.850
Hey, Jasmine. It's Rachel.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:14.925
Look, I made a mistake
in inviting you to dinner.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.490
And I'm really sorry.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.171
And I hope it doesn't totally
screw up your whole day.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.011
Merry Christmas.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.728
There's maybe
more sugar, butter.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.565
It looks like Grace's.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.044
Will it taste like it?
Let's see.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.170
What are you doing here?

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.323
Me and bunny were elected
to tell you that

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.129
everyone is really sorry.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.284
They say you wouldn't be mad
at me 'cause I'm too cute.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.165
And they are right.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.049
You all ready for Santa?

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.121
Am I'.>

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.170
I get to see all my presents,
and eat all the dessert I want,

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.567
and not get in trouble.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.167
And Nana's sweet potato pie
is my favorite.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.364
Mine too.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.410
I just hope my version
doesn't disappoint everyone.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.243
So far, it hasn't been
going that good.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.243
Are you smiling
when you make it?

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.531
When Nana cooked,
she always smiled.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.489
You haven't smiled a lot,
Pop-pop.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.005
When I get sad,

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.368
I just think about all the
things that make me happy.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.680
And then I smile.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.089
Maybe you should try it.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.564
Maybe I will.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.641
Hot!

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.685
What do you think, love?

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.051
Eggs.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.729
Just a little bit of cinnamon.
Now, remember that. Little bit.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.770
Sweet vanilla.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.091
All right?

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.491
And nutmeg.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.361
That's the bomb.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.801
I can't remember how much milk
you put in this.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.687
Uh-huh.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.606
Yeah.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.808
Hey, yo, Pops.
Santa came early.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.806
Oh, man.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.009
You want some
sweet potatoes, baby?

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.921
30. Daddy?
Hmm?

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.120
How do you like the cranberry salad?
Pretty good, huh?

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.207
Very good.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.968
I made the stuffing.
Do you like it?

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.883
Tasty.
Cheryl, would you like some?

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.169
Yes. I would, Rachel.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.685
That's very nice of y'all.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.603
There you go.
I'm going to be a copycat.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.170
Thank you.
I want some stuffing too.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.561
You can't get
enough stuffing, can you?

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.085
Sure can't.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.367
Let me get that.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.289
Do you want some stuffing, baby?

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.442
Boy, I'm a grown-ass woman.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.336
Cameron, you mind passing me
the green beans, please?

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.521
Don't eat too much.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.762
We should save some for
the shelter. Right, Granddad?

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.080
That's right, buddy.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.446
This is really delicious.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:11.484
Listen, if I promise not to cook,
can we do it again tomorrow?

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:16.082
Oh. Careful. Watch the floors
there, Cam.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.481
Never know when
we gotta resell. Right, Pops?

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.160
Right.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.369
If you want to get scratches out of
wood floors, here's a little trick.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.284
You get some shoe polish
and some Crisco oil.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.646
Get a pair of old underwear.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.451
Wrap the old underwear around
your hand, nice and tight,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.525
and you buff it out.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.410
Put a little muscle to it.
Buff it out real good.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.136
I'm sure you got a pair of old
underwear lying around, Walter.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.810
Little trick I learned
over in Croatia.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.521
Listen.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.130
I'ma stab your ass with this fork.
Do you hear me?

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.361
I would love that.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.601
Evan.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.896
What's going on with you? You've
been moping around all day.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.680
Nothing, yo. I guess
I just lost my appetite.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.080
Well, that's never
happened before.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.680
I love the new paint
on the porch, Pops.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.680
Evan, we were talking to you.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.886
And the hedges.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.806
You've been meaning to clean those
up for a while now. It's nice.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.566
I guess you finally
got around to it now, huh?

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.481
Yeah.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.561
I guess I did.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.766
You know they have these new
fiberglass gutters, right?

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.928
- Lonnie, shut your ass up.
- Lonnie, please.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.486
Now, damn!

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:24.040
Evan, baby,
what you talking about?

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.889
What am I talking about?

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.284
Tell 'em, Dad. Tell everybody
what it is I'm talking about.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.960
Wait a minute.
What the hell is going on?

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.280
Dad, you're selling the house?

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.842
No. You're joking, right?

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.642
You did this without
saying anything to us?

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.376
Cheryl, give that to me.
That's not what that is.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.209
Let me see this.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.408
Come on now, Walter.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.776
You know you should've
said something to somebody.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.096
Pop, Mom would have
spoken to everyone in this house

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.600
before she made
that kind of decision.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.376
Mom wouldn't even think
about selling the house.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.526
This is the family home.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.761
It's my house.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.976
Let me tell y'all something.
I understand...

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.525
We're just a little confused.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.204
It's really sudden, Dad.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.201
It's my house.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.816
Why would you
even consider that?

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.002
It's my house!

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.169
I'm supposed to ask your
permission to sell my house?

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.124
Evan, baby. Get him.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.361
Evan!

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.566
Evan, come back!

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.288
Well, at least we know
it can't get any worse.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.806
I'll get it.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.327
Hey, everybody,
there's a lady named Jasmine.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.010
She says
she's Aunt Rachel's friend.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.647
Hey!

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.881
Hey!
What are you doing here?

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.485
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.686
You invited me.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.967
I did. Did you not
get my message?

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.246
No. Oh.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.561
Um...

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.680
I never check my voicemails.
I'm a texter.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.804
What was it?
Am I not supposed...

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.880
No. No.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.002
I just wanted to make sure
you brought something.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.969
And you did!
You're a mind reader.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.121
This is great.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.201
Jasmine,

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.127
this is my family.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.201
Family, this is Jasmine.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.611
Okay, we have names.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:46.090
That's sister, father,
brother, sister-in-law, child.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.360
Nice to meet you all.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.240
- You can sit right here.
- Welcome.

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.486
Why would you do that?

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.936
Why would I do that?
Why would you do that?

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.376
What are you trying to do?
Break up a happy home?

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.576
Obviously, it's not that happy

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.720
if you are banging the cashier
from the Piggly Wiggly.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:02.731
You invited her to Christmas
dinner with your sister.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.202
Who does that?

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.361
Who does what?

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.570
Who puts paprika
in potato salad?

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.608
Who does that?

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.563
Everybody.
Not my family.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.684
We don't put paprika on potato salad.
We just don't do that.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.001
Okay, Lonnie, you're being
ridiculous. Come on.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.496
I'm talking to your sister
about the potato salad.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.216
Okay, we're in the middle
of Christmas dinner.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.685
You can talk to her later.
Okay.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.364
Come on now. Come on.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.726
Help me!

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.647
Okay. You like
them brownies, don't you?

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.609
This must be a special recipe.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.641
I love your home, by the way.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.006
Yeah? Thank you.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.286
It's so beautiful.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.696
I really think
you should. They're very good.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.736
I already had 'em, baby.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:49.807
Really pretty.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.130
I love your family.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.326
Thank you.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.686
I still have some.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.922
That's okay.
That's okay.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.490
Yeah, they are good.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.841
Is there any more dressing?

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.969
No dressing on this table.
I'm going to go grab some.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.166
Lonnie, sit down.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.046
Lonnie?

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.403
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.570
What are you doing here?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.365
Rachel, you know Lonnie.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.049
I'd love some ham. Thank you.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.121
Some ham?

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:37.568
How about I just stick a slice
at a time in your mouth?

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.761
You were trying to surprise me.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.206
That is so sweet.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.283
So, you two know each other?

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.405
Yeah, well, when you called me
from the supermarket

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.165
when I was getting those ingredients
for the banana pudding.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.521
Bananas, the vanilla,
the vanilla wafers.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.649
It's not every day around here you
run into a professional athlete

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.122
who invites you to spend
a weekend in Chicago.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.056
- What is going on?
- And you definitely don%run

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.687
into people nice enough to invite you
to such a beautiful Christmas dinner.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.241
So, Rachel knew that you knew Lonnie
when she invited you to our dinner?

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.361
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.688
I got a little toothache here.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:23.807
Orajel.

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.166
You were saying?

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.287
Well...

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.931
See, she recognized him
from one of our pictures.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.001
Oh!

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.004
There's pictures!

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.127
Shit!

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.486
You got a Instagram?

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.607
Want to see?

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.161
No.

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.611
I'd love to.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.211
Are you getting this?

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.691
How sweet!

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.841
Right?

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.962
Just cute.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.405
Christian?

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.362
Oh. Uh... Don't swipe left.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.205
I was thinking Lonnie and I wouldn't
get to spend Christmas together

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.203
because of his grandma.

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.081
Cheryl?

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440
Oh! Shit!

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.885
Shit!
Hey, Cameron,

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.296
you and Niya take
your sister downstairs.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.536
Finish your meal
down there, okay?

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.616
- But I didn't even get to see the pictures.
- Now!

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.608
I need to see these pictures.

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.170
You get your plate.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.216
- And you get yours. And your napkin.
- You can move faster than that.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.376
See? I always get treated like this.
You need to whip his ass.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.896
This is the problem
with these children nowadays.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.604
I never get to see stuff.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.887
Sonya, you gotta take
more control.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.604
This is not fair.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.646
Be on back.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:33.801
Is that oil?

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.001
I Skyped you.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.520
- Thank you.
- Wait for me.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.849
All right. Here we go.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.087
Your Grandma Cheryl.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.522
It's obvious that
she misunderstood...

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.250
Thanks.
What I said.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:57.244
You said your grandmother was sick,
and you had to take care of her.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.456
And I love that about you, babe.

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.496
- Just shut up.
- So proud of you.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:04.161
Where is she? I would love
to meet your grandma.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.730
I'd love to meet Grandma Cheryl.

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.929
No, baby. You don't want
to meet Grandma Cheryl.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.201
You know what?

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.640
I'll get Grandma.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.361
Baby.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.848
Aunt May going to ask you
not to go get Grandma.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.046
Don't disturb Grandma.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.849
I think it's the perfect time
for it.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.056
I'ma ask that
you let Grandma rest

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.324
because every time Grandma come out,
something different starts to happen.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.641
We don't have to impress
nobody with Grandma.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:30.451
Walter, your old ass need
to do something.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.456
Now, you sitting there like
you don't hear this shit.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.561
Lonnie,

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.568
you don't want her
to get Grandma.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.841
Christian.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.289
Let's go in the kitchen.
How about that?

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.361
I'm good.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.325
Sonya.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.491
Auntie May, let's go
make some kimchi balls.

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.291
Hey, Lonnie. Can't help you.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.764
Baby, did I say something wrong?

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.004
You said a lot of things wrong.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.366
You want to meet Grandma?

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.526
Well, here she is.

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.096
- Don't shoot me!
- Wait a minute.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.168
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.689
Cheryl! Cheryl! Wait!

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.320
Give me that gun!

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.724
You all knew who Grandma was!

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:17.881
That's not Grandma!

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.247
This is ridiculous!
Somebody say something!

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.691
Lonnie, what the hell
is going on?

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.761
Shut up!

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.126
I'm his wife, you dumb bitch.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.480
Who you calling a dumb bitch?

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.927
You! You dumb bitch, young
bitch, silly bitch, dead bitch.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.126
She got the gun, bitch.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.576
Lonnie, if you're going to bring
bitches in here, bring a smart bitch.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.682
Give me that rifle,
and give it to me right now!

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.330
Stay out of this, Christian.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.527
Christian, get her!

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.124
I'm too old for this shit.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.161
Shit!

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.287
Shit!

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.441
Christian, stop her.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.122
Cheryl, please! No, no, no!

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.720
Cheryl, drop the gun.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.805
Cheryl, you're not going
to shoot me.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.690
You're not going to shoot me outside
in front of all these people.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.650
- Cheryl, please!
- Enough!

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.016
- Walter.
- Okay. That's enough.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.327
Shit! You shot me!
Cheryl, please. Enough.

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.051
She's the best shot
in the family, Lonnie.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.806
If she wanted to shoot
your ass, she would have.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.966
Come on.
I'm taking the gun now.

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.401
Give it to him, baby.
Let me have it.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.601
I got you.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.491
We all got you.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.289
We all got you, all right?

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.251
Something happened
to Uncle Evan!

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.526
What?

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.205
Evan's going to be fine.
Thank God.

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.965
He's a little banged up,
but very lucky.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.289
We still need to run a few more tests,
but he should be okay to go home.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:20.801
I don't need...

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.006
Any help.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.881
I know.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:39.722
I can't believe this is
how we're going to remember

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.723
our last Christmas in the house.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.130
At least Evan's okay.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.006
Cheryl...

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.484
What I did...

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.001
No matter what,
no matter how I felt,

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.041
it was awful.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.604
Yeah, it was.

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.171
I'm sorry.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.090
No.

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.402
You probably did me a favor.

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:27.283
Lonnie had a wandering eye

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.003
and a wandering everything else.

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.730
He wasn't going to change.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.809
And he refused to floss.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.082
But as much as I want to blame
Lonnie for everything,

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.127
I probably could have been
a little less...

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.526
Overbearing?

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.965
Controlling.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.087
You're also ambitious
and generous

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.242
and the smartest woman
that I know.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.650
I always wanted to be like you.

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.526
You wanted to be like me?

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:14.082
Yeah! You're my big sister.
Of course.

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.571
I was always jealous of you.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.924
I mean, Mom and Dad always let you
just figure it out on your own.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.844
Highly overrated.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.691
I was jealous of you
because you never had to.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.647
Also overrated.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.406
So, what are you going to do?

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:44.640
I don't know.

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:51.240
Maybe you could help me
with my divorce?

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:54.404
If you ever get that law degree.

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:56.970
You can't help yourself,
can you?

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.683
I just can't.
Just gotta... You know?

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.603
Learned this one.
I earned it.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.451
How you doing?

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.802
Okay.
Yeah.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.890
Quite an accident, huh?

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.204
Being high on pain pills
probably didn't help.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.006
Mom's never going
to see me graduate,

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.482
never see me in pros,

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.844
get married,

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.289
have my first kid.

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.601
She was supposed
to be my date to the draft.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.729
We talked about what we was
going to wear and everything.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.962
I know you're missing
your mother.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:58.442
She was always there for you.

01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:59.646
Yeah.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.844
Yeah, she was.

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.647
She was always cheering
the loudest.

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.442
Every time I caught the ball.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.167
Every time I dropped the ball, she
still was cheering the loudest.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.601
Every moment in my life,

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.961
my mother was there for me.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.849
The one time...

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.969
The one moment
that she needed me,

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.963
I was not there for her.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.246
Evan.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.090
You were exactly
where she wanted you.

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:45.808
Watching you do what you love

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.928
is what she loved.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.250
I mean, she's still watching you
and loving every minute of it.

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.043
It's not fair.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.929
It's not. I know.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.967
But numbing the pain
doesn't make it go away.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.088
Neither does selling the house.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:20.331
Without

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.804
your mother,

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.326
it's like...

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.646
It's like

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.569
learning to walk again.

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.885
Though...

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:46.283
I guess we're gonna
both have to learn together.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.650
There they are. Managing
directors of Brigham's.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.296
They just want to meet you
before they leave town.

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.321
It's not a big deal.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.656
Let's just get it over with.
All right?

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.200
Let's get it over with.
Come on. Smile.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.289
Walter, I'm so glad
you could make it.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.121
We needed you more
than ever this year.

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.087
I think I needed you even more.

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:24.931
Merry Christmas.

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.089
Merry Christmas.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.256
- That is so true.
- I tell ya.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.124
Because the truth is, we are going
to make more money than anybody.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.248
It's going to make people sick.
And you, my man...

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.404
We're going to take you
to the White House.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.329
Yes, sir. I'm not joking.

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.845
Don't think I'm playing.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.041
<i>Our prime purpose in life</i>

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.764
<i>is to help people.</i>

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.282
<i>And if we cannot help them, at
the very least, don't hurt them.</i>

01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.896
You're going to be happy.

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.440
And you, my man,
are going to be happy.

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:02.681
Right?

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.085
I can't do this.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.567
I'm serious. We can take
it to the top. What?

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.411
I believe it. I know we can.

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.403
Have a good evening, gentlemen.

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.888
Merry Christmas and God bless.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.009
I'm not allowing this place
to go without a fight.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.010
Don't worry, Pop.
You won't be fighting alone.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:43.728
You see this old man
skimping on your dressing?

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.285
Come on, Pop.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.328
That's more like it.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.845
Merry Christmas to you.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.161
Thank you.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.608
I love you, Pop.
I love you, son.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.084
"If you're going to help me
with my divorce,

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.562
"you gotta finish law school
first. Cheryl."

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.201
Wow.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.247
<i>Is this Grandmaster Munchie
Mega Mellow Mix, Volume 7?</i>

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.846
<i>It's Mellow Mega Mix, Volume 8.</i>

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.160
The one I made just for you.

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.243
That was a good mix tape.

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.451
It was.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.926
What are you doing?

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.961
We missed out on something
special 20 years ago.

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.560
And I'll be damned
if I let that happen again.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:30.123
So, I was wondering,
if you're not busy tonight

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:33.003
will you let me take you
to the prom?

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.561
Rachel?

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.081
Rachel?

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.364
Just gonna leave me
out here like that?

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.849
I was digging through my mother's attic
for two hours looking for this tape.

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.096
Munchie? You
making a lot of noise out there...

01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.202
Ma, go to bed!

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.771
This is crazy.

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.089
She ain't never gonna change.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.481
Damn.

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.771
Damn.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.725
It's Cheryl's.

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.850
I kind of barbecued mine

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.803
after, you know...

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.290
May I have this dance?

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:50.761
Yeah.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.240
It's gonna be a terrible night.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:08.004
Absolute worst.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.243
Talk about going out
with a bang.

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.120
Yeah.

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.011
I sure am going
to miss this old house.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.046
Yeah.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:10.921
Hmm.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.127
When I

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.963
proposed to Grace,

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.329
I knew I was going
to do everything I could

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.641
to give her
the best life possible.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:32.971
Sometimes I...

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.482
Sometimes I think
I didn't do enough.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.126
I really didn't think
it was possible.

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.641
But you really are dumber
than you look.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.485
You know,

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.208
I've performed with some
of the greatest entertainers

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.801
to ever grace a stage.

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.923
And I've dined atop
of the Eiffel Tower

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.364
as the lights shined as
bright as a thousand stars.

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.608
Even got drunk
in a pub in Denmark

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:16.206
with the Count of Rosenberg.

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.450
He was a huge fan.

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.410
That was when I was on that
Sly and the Family Stone tour.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.520
Mmm-hmm.
Remember that one?

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.800
Little Sister.
Yes.

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.131
Yes, indeed.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:32.960
You know,

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:40.089
I'm living
my happily ever after.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.284
And because of you

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.405
and with you,

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:49.086
my beautiful sister

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.403
got to live
her happily ever after, too.

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.405
Yes, she did.

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.484
How you like it?

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.686
That's Turkish coffee.

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.560
Got that on the Chaka Khan tour.
Tell Me Something Good, 1982!

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.970
Best coffee I ever had.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.047
Yes, indeed.

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.731
You know what?

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.127
We ain't tried your pie, Walter.

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.168
Maybe it's for the best.
No.

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.129
How bad could it be?

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.521
Well. Well, we gonna see.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.403
I'm tryin' to scoop
that piece out of there.

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:45.971
You put this together, Walter. Now,
let's see what we're dealing with.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.206
I'll be damned.

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:42.051
Well, wait a minute,
Walter. Damn!

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.122
You ain't gonna eat
all of it! Give me some.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.165
There's a little crust there.

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:49.801
Hey!

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.927
Hey, Cheryl! Sonya!

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.126
Come on.
Rachel, come on. All of you!

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.567
Come on down here
and get some of this pie!

01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.801
I did it!

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.121
I did it!

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.521
I'ma get some more of this
Turkish coffee for everybody.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:06.761
Okay, then.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:10.208
Hey! Come and get
some of this pie! I did it!

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.770
Come on, all of you!

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.205
Hey, Christian, all of you!

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.886
Hey, Cheryl! Evan! Rachel!

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:06.841
Nuts.

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.885
Am I tasting your nuts?

01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:16.806
You feeling like that,
Rachel? Huh?

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.086
'Cause I'm every woman.

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:19.896
I ain't scared of you, Aunt May.
Well, then bring...

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.081
Bitch!

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.008
Cut. Cut!

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:28.407
Okay, Santa.
I'm going back in, baby.

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.766
How do you like that?

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.009
Too much, Santa?

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.081
Hold on, now.

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:40.246
To wash it all down, some milk
tea with boiled tapioca balls.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.925
We don't put balls in our mouth.

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:43.730
Not necessarily.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.361
Aunt May studied tae kwon do
in a dojo in Taipei,

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:53.046
and they called me
Sensei Titty Chop.

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:56.203
You know why they called me that?
Because I chops bitches' titties.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.486
Ask Tina Turner about me.

01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:01.003
I can always kick her ass. One time,
I had to titty-chop that bitch.

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.736
Well, I'ma tell you, you can't
have none of this ass, Lonnie.

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.000
If you were biting your wife's ass some
more, maybe y'all have a happier marriage.

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.016
Bite it, lick it,
whatever you need to do.

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:10.400
She look unhappy
as shit out there,

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.966
worrying about do the fish
have goddamn teeth.

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.406
Baby, do I bite your ass?

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.971
Every night.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.766
You heard that?

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.408
My bags are in the car.
Mmm-mm.

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.045
My bags aren't in the damn car.

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.043
They in the driveway. Okay?

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:28.616
That's where my shit is.

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.722
And because I ain't had
my medication,

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:33.167
I don't know what I'm saying,
goddamn Walter.

01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:34.281
Damn!

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.887
You could just have something rolled for
me or something when I come to visit.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:40.088
That's why you killed
my damn sister off.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.730
Because you
don't treat her right.

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.847
Shit!

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:48.687
Cut.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.525
<i>All right, cut! Cut!</i>

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.604
<i>Cut! Cut. Let's do it again.</i>
