00:13.662 --> 00:16.782
There are cabinet members
who question whether you're fit

00:16.873 --> 00:19.827
to continue as chief
executive of this country.

00:19.918 --> 00:22.374
We are invoking the 25th Amendment.

00:22.462 --> 00:28.501
I intend to show your erratic and irrational
behaviour since the start of this crisis.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.001
You see the results.
The vote is against you.

00:31.096 --> 00:34.346
Please remove yourself from
the decision-making process.

00:34.433 --> 00:39.391
I swear that I will faithfully execute the
office of the President of the United States,

00:39.479 --> 00:40.855
so help me God.

00:40.939 --> 00:45.566
I got a message that the president
called off the military offensive.

00:45.652 --> 00:46.897
- Is it true?
- Yes.

00:46.987 --> 00:48.564
- You knew about it?
- I did.

00:48.655 --> 00:52.819
Why keep my people processing
intel on a scrapped operation?

00:52.909 --> 00:57.037
There's a strong possibility
the White House will reinstate the attack.

00:57.122 --> 00:59.411
- Dad?
- Sweetheart.

00:59.499 --> 01:03.663
- I've been trying to reach you.
- Are you at the sheriffs station?

01:03.753 --> 01:08.083
They're taking me to the Mathesons' house
to pack up my things. Glad you're OK.

01:08.175 --> 01:09.455
Me too.

01:09.551 --> 01:11.425
- Have you got the audio file?
- No.

01:11.511 --> 01:15.260
Are you saying there's
no audio file on that chip?

01:15.348 --> 01:17.471
If there were, they were destroyed.

01:17.559 --> 01:21.058
Michelle traced the sequence
to a hacker named Alex Hewitt.

01:21.146 --> 01:24.978
- He created the Cyprus audio file?
- Yes.

01:27.110 --> 01:30.775
I'm checking up on a man
who engineered the recording.

01:30.864 --> 01:34.529
Are you convinced
that the Cyprus recording is forged?

01:34.618 --> 01:37.572
Yes, sir, without a doubt.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.738
Alex?

01:52.636 --> 01:55.471
- Hewitt's not here.
- I'm not surprised.

01:55.555 --> 01:58.924
Check the garage,
see if his car's still here.

02:21.790 --> 02:25.657
Even with the delay, we predict
we have not lost the element of surprise.

02:25.752 --> 02:30.580
As you can see here, sir, the primary
targets are still relatively unguarded.

02:30.674 --> 02:33.425
Resistance should be insignificant.

02:33.510 --> 02:37.294
- When were these pictures taken?
- Ten minutes ago, sir.

02:38.140 --> 02:40.713
Then we can proceed
with the attack as planned.

02:40.809 --> 02:42.967
Yes, Mr President.

02:54.614 --> 02:56.987
I need your key codes, sir.

03:03.999 --> 03:06.371
How much longer will Prescott detain me?

03:06.460 --> 03:09.247
Until after the press conference.

03:09.337 --> 03:13.335
In a couple of hours, he's going
to announce the US response to the bomb,

03:13.425 --> 03:16.130
and his ascension to the office.

03:17.637 --> 03:23.261
Your key codes belong
to President Prescott now. It's protocol.

03:59.346 --> 04:01.422
Confirmed.

04:27.916 --> 04:29.992
Know why Chappelle called this meeting?

04:30.085 --> 04:34.248
No, he just told everybody
to save their work and get in here.

04:35.757 --> 04:38.082
This information is confidential.

04:38.176 --> 04:40.393
It'll stay inside until
it's been made public,

04:40.437 --> 04:42.969
which should be in the next few hours.

04:43.056 --> 04:47.350
The cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment
and removed David Palmer from office.

04:47.436 --> 04:50.970
- Jim Prescott is now the president.
- Why?

04:51.064 --> 04:53.935
That isn't relevant to our charge.

04:54.025 --> 04:57.026
- Yes, it is, Ryan.
- What's your problem, Almeida?

04:57.112 --> 05:01.026
We know Palmer was removed cos
he didn't wanna go on with the bombings.

05:01.116 --> 05:03.689
That makes what Bauer's
doing more relevant.

05:03.785 --> 05:07.783
Bauer has cried wolf twice already.
He's come up with nothing.

05:07.873 --> 05:11.407
I have an order from District
that disallows any further resources

05:11.501 --> 05:13.328
from being expended on him.

05:13.420 --> 05:17.833
Why is everybody so afraid to look at all
the sides of this? What if Bauer's right?

05:17.924 --> 05:22.136
What if it was forged and we're about
to bomb three innocent countries?

05:22.220 --> 05:26.681
Tony, let me first say that your office
has done a remarkable job today.

05:26.767 --> 05:30.681
There is no way the people on the Hill
are not going to reward every one of you

05:30.771 --> 05:33.096
for your role in averting disaster.

05:33.190 --> 05:36.938
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Let me finish.

05:37.027 --> 05:41.570
The success of this office today
is due in large part to the technical team.

05:41.656 --> 05:45.108
The same team that has concluded
that the Cyprus audio

05:45.202 --> 05:48.487
is an untreated, unforged original.

05:48.580 --> 05:54.416
There comes a time when you have
to let go. Not every hunch works out.

05:54.503 --> 06:00.007
Bauer's chasing a ghost.
I can't put it any simpler than that.

06:00.091 --> 06:01.883
That's all.

06:06.139 --> 06:09.804
- What are you gonna do?
- I have to talk to one of Prescott's staff.

06:09.893 --> 06:14.306
If Jack comes in with the evidence,
we need somebody in place to take it to.

06:14.397 --> 06:17.315
If Chappelle finds out
you're doing an end run...

06:17.400 --> 06:20.070
I know. I know.

06:26.868 --> 06:29.276
- The car is gone.
- OK.

06:29.371 --> 06:34.246
- What do you wanna do?
- Kingsley took anything important.

06:34.334 --> 06:38.711
- We gotta find Hewitt. Let's go.
- Stop right there!

06:39.881 --> 06:42.372
- Sit down!
- Let go of me!

06:42.467 --> 06:45.587
Don't move. Don't move!

06:45.679 --> 06:49.759
Who are you? Don't look at her,
look at me! Who are you?

06:49.850 --> 06:52.804
- I'm nobody.
- He's my private bodyguard.

06:52.894 --> 06:56.310
- Secret Service?
- Ex.

07:01.069 --> 07:03.821
- Mrs Palmer.
- Jack Bauer.

07:04.656 --> 07:06.732
- Stand up.
- Why?

07:06.825 --> 07:08.983
- Stand up!
- What are you gonna do to me?

07:09.077 --> 07:11.485
Turn around.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.367
I'm not carrying any weapons.

07:16.126 --> 07:18.249
Take a seat.

07:32.476 --> 07:34.883
- Why are you here?
- Trying to help David.

07:34.978 --> 07:39.142
- You're no longer part of his life.
- Don't believe everything you read.

07:39.232 --> 07:46.030
David's asked me to pool my resources to
see if I can find out who's behind the bomb.

07:46.114 --> 07:50.112
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care what you believe.

07:57.584 --> 08:01.416
Do you know who did this?
Who ransacked this place?

08:01.505 --> 08:06.083
- You're here for the same reason I am.
- What reason would that be?

08:06.176 --> 08:09.296
- To find Alex Hewitt.
- Why?

08:09.387 --> 08:13.136
- You must know. You're here.
- Why don't you tell me?

08:13.225 --> 08:17.685
He created a recording
that's about to start a war.

08:28.156 --> 08:29.650
How do you know about that?

08:29.741 --> 08:32.528
I don't like the way
this conversation is going.

08:32.619 --> 08:36.616
- How do you know about Cyprus audio?
- How dare you talk down to me!

08:36.706 --> 08:39.659
I am not a politician.
I will not debate this with you.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.953
Answer me. What do you know
about the Cyprus recording?

08:43.046 --> 08:46.711
Every expert in the government
with priority clearance

08:46.800 --> 08:50.335
has been working on it for six hours.
I've got a lot of sources.

08:50.429 --> 08:55.933
- What do you know about Alex Hewitt?
- That he's a freelance audio technician.

08:56.017 --> 08:58.805
- Who does he work for?
- A man named Peter Kingsley.

08:58.895 --> 09:00.306
Why?

09:00.397 --> 09:03.980
Kingsley represents Caspian Sea
oils interests that want the US

09:04.067 --> 09:09.062
at war with the Middle East. Kingsley hired
Hewitt to fabricate the Cyprus recording.

09:09.156 --> 09:12.738
Mr Bauer, I've walked the corridors
of power my entire life.

09:12.826 --> 09:17.488
You'd be surprised how much information
you can get if you have something to trade.

09:17.581 --> 09:21.365
- What are you doing?
- Take a seat.

09:23.044 --> 09:25.333
Take a seat!

09:40.645 --> 09:43.646
Come out!

09:44.900 --> 09:48.980
Open the door slowly,
I wanna see both your hands! Now! Now!

09:49.070 --> 09:51.147
Please don't hurt me!

09:51.239 --> 09:53.315
- Get on the ground!
- OK. OK.

09:53.408 --> 09:57.488
Don't move. Get on the ground!
Who are you?

09:57.579 --> 09:58.610
- Mrs Palmer?
- Alex.

09:58.705 --> 10:01.326
You said you would help me.
Why does he have a gun?

10:01.416 --> 10:04.583
- Shut up. Go sit with her.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

10:04.669 --> 10:06.164
- Move!
- You said you'd...

10:06.254 --> 10:09.172
Shut up. Don't say anything.
He's a federal agent.

10:09.257 --> 10:11.084
- Shut up.
- I am not talking to you!

10:11.176 --> 10:13.465
- Shut up!
- Don't say anything, Alex.

10:13.553 --> 10:16.175
Alex, don't say anything!

10:17.265 --> 10:19.341
You're gonna talk to me now.

10:33.698 --> 10:38.657
You took voice samples from three leaders
and intercut them with Ali's for the audio?

10:38.745 --> 10:41.153
- I didn't say that.
- And Kingsley paid you.

10:41.248 --> 10:43.573
- No!
- You're a traitor.

10:43.667 --> 10:47.617
- You know what they'll do to you?
- I'm not. I didn't know, I swear.

10:47.712 --> 10:49.705
I told Mrs Palmer. She'll tell you.

10:49.798 --> 10:52.040
Forget about her. She can't help you.

10:52.134 --> 10:56.297
But if you tell me everything about
the Cyprus audio, I'll do what I can.

10:56.388 --> 11:00.255
- I won't say anything until I see a lawyer.
- I am your lawyer, son.

11:00.350 --> 11:05.510
Those people you worked for thought
you'd die in the bomb. They're after you.

11:05.605 --> 11:09.306
If you wanna stay alive,
start telling me everything.

11:09.401 --> 11:11.477
No, I only wanna talk to Mrs Palmer.

11:14.990 --> 11:20.411
Why her? How's she connected to this?
How do you know her?

11:20.495 --> 11:23.698
I just met her today.
She called, said she could help me.

11:23.790 --> 11:28.582
I know she's the president's ex-wife.
She's got connections high up.

11:28.670 --> 11:34.376
She can't help you now, Alex.
I'm the only one who can help you now.

11:36.511 --> 11:38.753
I wanna to talk to her.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.937
OK. Let me see what I can do.
Give me your keys.

11:48.023 --> 11:50.596
- Why?
- Give me your keys.

11:54.613 --> 11:58.112
- Which one of these locks this door?
- This one.

12:00.911 --> 12:03.283
Just step back.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.916
- What did he say?
- Why are you here?

12:16.009 --> 12:19.176
Please don't tell me
it's to help the president.

12:19.262 --> 12:23.260
All right. I came here to protect myself.

12:23.934 --> 12:27.516
Alex was paid by Kingsley
to record certain conversations.

12:27.604 --> 12:30.807
Some of those were with me,
they incriminate me.

12:30.899 --> 12:33.390
You're collaborating with Peter Kingsley?

12:33.485 --> 12:37.020
He assured me that the bomb
would never go off.

12:37.114 --> 12:40.779
What were you thinking?
What the hell were you thinking?

12:40.867 --> 12:43.156
- Who are you calling?
- CTU.

12:43.245 --> 12:46.696
I'm a sworn federal agent.
You just confessed to a federal crime.

12:46.790 --> 12:51.084
- I suggest you hang up that phone.
- I need to speak to Tony Almeida.

12:51.169 --> 12:53.874
I am the only one
who can get Hewitt to cooperate.

12:53.964 --> 12:57.796
And for that, I'll want
full immunity from prosecution.

12:58.635 --> 13:02.253
Now hang up the phone
and I'll tell you everything.

13:03.181 --> 13:08.424
- Jack, it's Tony, what's going on?
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.

13:11.940 --> 13:13.434
Start.

13:18.155 --> 13:22.567
- Start!
- I wanted to bring down David's presidency.

13:22.659 --> 13:25.862
I was so angry with David
for what he did to me.

13:25.954 --> 13:31.197
I worked tirelessly for years to put him
into office. I sacrificed everything.

13:31.293 --> 13:35.540
My career, my family. David betrayed me.

13:35.630 --> 13:39.082
So you wanted revenge.
What did Kingsley want?

13:41.136 --> 13:44.884
Money. A war in the Middle East
would triple the value of his oil.

13:44.973 --> 13:47.974
You're here to ensure
no one connects you to Kingsley.

13:48.059 --> 13:51.678
Yes, like I told you,
I came to protect myself.

13:51.772 --> 13:56.065
Look, Mr Bauer, there's only one person
you need to prosecute for this.

13:56.151 --> 13:59.567
And that person is sitting
in that room there.

13:59.654 --> 14:02.858
I want full immunity.

14:03.533 --> 14:07.697
Otherwise, it's just your word against mine.

14:26.723 --> 14:29.095
She'll talk with you.

14:36.566 --> 14:39.437
- I know you're scared.
- You said I would be OK.

14:39.528 --> 14:43.146
I know there's been a little wrinkle,
but we can fix that.

14:43.949 --> 14:49.191
What do you think, Aaron? You think
I'm unfit to fulfil my duties as president?

14:49.746 --> 14:54.373
Sir, I'm under orders
not to discuss this with you.

14:54.459 --> 14:56.535
Are you under orders not to listen?

14:58.588 --> 15:00.664
- No, sir.
- Good.

15:02.134 --> 15:06.926
Then I'll do all the talking.
I assume you remember Jack Bauer.

15:07.013 --> 15:08.923
He believes the Cyprus recording,

15:09.015 --> 15:12.515
the single piece of evidence
propelling us into this war,

15:12.602 --> 15:14.761
was fabricated.

15:14.855 --> 15:19.351
I've been removed from office
because I believe in Bauer.

15:19.443 --> 15:24.270
If it wasn't for Jack, Los Angeles
would be a killing field by now.

15:24.364 --> 15:29.904
Still, Prescott and the cabinet
refuse to believe that he might be right.

15:31.371 --> 15:36.116
If Jack finds the evidence after the planes
have dropped their payloads,

15:36.209 --> 15:38.368
then it'll be too late.

15:38.462 --> 15:41.581
We will be at war against
three innocent countries.

15:43.216 --> 15:48.341
I'm sure if Jack Bauer finds evidence,
Vice President Prescott...

15:48.430 --> 15:53.139
I mean, the president,
will recall the bombers.

15:55.979 --> 16:01.104
- You're under orders not to speak to me.
- I'm doing my best, sir.

16:01.193 --> 16:04.727
- Your best would be to help me.
- By doing what?

16:06.990 --> 16:11.319
I need to talk to Jack Bauer.
Find out if he's secured the evidence.

16:22.506 --> 16:26.420
If I remember correctly,
you have a son in the Navy.

16:26.510 --> 16:28.965
Yes, sir, I do.

16:30.514 --> 16:35.935
It's a fine thing to defend one's country.
You should be proud.

16:36.686 --> 16:40.138
Let's make sure the cause
he's fighting for is the just one.

16:42.734 --> 16:46.814
Get me a sat phone. I need a secure line.

16:49.866 --> 16:55.287
Put these in the overnight database.
Chappelle's gonna need 'em for his briefing.

16:55.372 --> 16:58.657
Why are you giving this to me?
This is your situation report.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.372
I'm on something else.

17:01.461 --> 17:03.537
What else?

17:04.381 --> 17:07.964
I don't have to explain myself
to you, Carrie. Just do it.

17:08.050 --> 17:10.507
You do need to explain yourself

17:10.595 --> 17:16.016
cos I think you're going behind
Chappelle's back, trying to help Jack Bauer.

17:18.561 --> 17:21.895
Do you really wanna do this, Carrie?
Come after me?

17:21.982 --> 17:24.703
I've been letting you get away
with a lot since you got here,

17:24.903 --> 17:27.818
but if you want the
gloves to come off, fine.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.074
What's going on here?

17:33.160 --> 17:38.201
She's asking me to take on some of
her workload. I just wanna know why.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.366
Why don't you wanna tell her?

17:44.588 --> 17:46.913
It's none of her business, Tony.

17:47.007 --> 17:50.957
Look, just tell her, so we can
get back to work here.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.256
All right.

17:55.348 --> 17:59.429
District's asked me to step in as a liaison
to facilitate the power shift.

17:59.519 --> 18:02.971
I'll be on the phone for the next two hours.

18:03.064 --> 18:06.268
Sounds like a promotion. Congratulations.

18:11.615 --> 18:15.233
- You think she believed me?
- No.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.627
Go over it again.
Look, I need you to find it fast,

18:26.713 --> 18:31.541
even if you need to pull agents who can
help you. This needs to take first priority.

18:31.635 --> 18:34.552
Division's breathing down
my neck for some reason.

18:34.638 --> 18:37.722
- That's something I don't need.
- I'll take care of it.

18:37.808 --> 18:39.468
All right.

18:39.559 --> 18:41.682
- Mr Chappelle.
- Yes, Carrie?

18:42.354 --> 18:45.224
In my opinion, Tony Almeida's
not fit to run CTU.

18:46.316 --> 18:49.767
- Why not?
- He's got Michelle working off book.

18:49.861 --> 18:52.020
- Doing what?
- I can't say for sure.

18:52.114 --> 18:56.775
But I have a feeling the two of them
are still trying to help Bauer.

18:57.828 --> 18:59.904
Thank you.

19:14.636 --> 19:16.593
It'll be fine.

19:19.641 --> 19:22.761
Here you go, thanks.

19:22.853 --> 19:24.726
- Almeida.
- Tony, it's Jack.

19:24.813 --> 19:28.597
- What's happening?
- President still holding off on the attack?

19:28.692 --> 19:32.357
Things have gotten worse.
It's not public, but Palmer's been pulled.

19:32.446 --> 19:35.779
- What do you mean?
- His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment

19:35.866 --> 19:39.317
because he wanted to wait
for confirmation of the recording.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.487
Prescott's now president.

19:41.580 --> 19:46.621
I'll bring evidence proving the recording's
been forged. Prescott won't listen to it?

19:46.710 --> 19:51.455
He won't wait for it. Get me that evidence
quickly, and I'll call Prescott with it.

19:51.548 --> 19:54.465
Start by sending a chopper
to the address you gave me.

19:54.551 --> 19:57.303
- I got Hewitt.
- He definitely made the recording?

19:57.387 --> 20:00.341
- Yes, absolutely.
- Will he testify?

20:01.892 --> 20:03.516
We're working on it.

20:03.602 --> 20:06.971
If I go to Chappelle and request
a chopper for you, he'll deny it.

20:07.063 --> 20:10.230
- He's got orders from District.
- Deal with it, Tony.

20:10.317 --> 20:14.101
We got bombers in the air.
Hewitt's our only chance of stopping this.

20:14.196 --> 20:15.227
I'll do my best.

20:15.322 --> 20:17.113
OK, thanks, Tony.

20:17.199 --> 20:19.986
I know, Alex. I understand your concern.

20:20.076 --> 20:23.991
But the fact remains,
we both made a mistake.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.034
But we're lucky because they need us.

20:27.125 --> 20:32.998
Any deal I make will include you, and vice
versa. Remember, we're in this together.

20:33.089 --> 20:35.166
Are you sure about this?

20:35.258 --> 20:39.801
Honey, I would never lie to you.
But you have to remember this one thing.

20:39.888 --> 20:44.301
I am the only one looking after
your interest. No one else.

20:44.392 --> 20:45.856
I know how these things work.

20:45.885 --> 20:48.971
Just do as I say,
and it'll all turn out well.

20:49.064 --> 20:50.641
What about him?

20:50.732 --> 20:54.812
Don't worry about him. I'll handle
Agent Bauer. He won't be a problem.

20:54.903 --> 20:56.979
He's very low on the food chain.

20:58.949 --> 21:02.483
So, if I do this,
you can keep me out of jail?

21:02.577 --> 21:06.990
Absolutely. You'll be granted
full immunity just like I promised.

21:07.082 --> 21:09.158
OK?

21:17.092 --> 21:19.134
All right, Jack, this
is how it's gonna work.

21:19.235 --> 21:21.718
He'll come in and testify.

21:21.805 --> 21:25.850
He can demonstrate the technology
in a matter of minutes.

21:28.228 --> 21:32.356
Good. The chopper's on its way.

21:39.656 --> 21:43.701
You heard Chappelle. He won't let us
have a chopper if he knows it's for Jack.

21:43.785 --> 21:47.119
But Jack's got Hewitt,
who definitely made that recording.

21:47.205 --> 21:51.452
- Chappelle can't ignore that.
- He can do whatever he wants.

21:51.543 --> 21:55.078
Yeah. Mm-hm. OK.

21:56.131 --> 21:58.622
Let me get back to you, Marc.

21:58.717 --> 22:01.172
- What?
- Jack Bauer just contacted us.

22:01.261 --> 22:02.506
Really? Where is he?

22:02.596 --> 22:04.588
- North Hollywood.
- What's he doing?

22:04.681 --> 22:07.931
He wants to bring in the guy
who forged the Cyprus recording.

22:08.018 --> 22:09.216
Fine, let him.

22:09.311 --> 22:11.980
He's too far away.
We need to send a chopper.

22:12.063 --> 22:14.981
We've been through this, Tony.
I'm done with Bauer.

22:15.066 --> 22:18.767
He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere.
We're onto other things.

22:18.862 --> 22:25.363
More important than the US launching
military strikes based on false information?

22:25.452 --> 22:28.406
The thing is, Tony, you've been reassigned.

22:30.874 --> 22:33.447
Reassigned? Where?

22:33.543 --> 22:36.959
I'll let you know in a few days.
For now, you can go home.

22:37.047 --> 22:39.170
Ryan, you can't reassign me now.

22:39.257 --> 22:45.130
This recording is real. We are going to war.
We need to prepare for domestic response.

22:45.222 --> 22:48.970
You have made yourself a liability
I just can't afford.

22:49.059 --> 22:52.891
You've got 15 minutes
to clean out your desk and get out.

23:28.890 --> 23:30.219
What are you doing?

23:30.308 --> 23:32.791
They took the disk that had my comb filter.

23:32.991 --> 23:35.647
I'll need to rebuild that
file to demonstrate.

23:38.275 --> 23:43.696
OK, the tarball has to decompress.
It'll take about 20 minutes.

23:43.780 --> 23:46.188
- How's it gonna work?
- I'll make a recording.

23:46.283 --> 23:49.486
Right on the spot, shift it around,
reframe segments.

23:49.578 --> 23:53.029
It'll have the same specs as Cyprus.
It'll blow their minds.

23:54.708 --> 23:57.329
- Good.
- And then I'm free to go, right?

23:57.419 --> 23:59.826
That's what she said.

24:02.632 --> 24:05.005
Yes, you'll be fine, Alex.

24:06.219 --> 24:08.675
How come you're being
so nice all of a sudden?

24:08.764 --> 24:11.385
- What do you mean?
- Before, it was all my fault,

24:11.475 --> 24:15.555
you called me a traitor,
and now everything's "Fine, Alex"?

24:20.525 --> 24:23.099
- You're gonna screw me.
- We won't screw you.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.816
You two made a deal,
you're gonna hang me out.

24:25.906 --> 24:30.366
Alex, calm down. We can't hang you out.
You have the proof.

24:30.452 --> 24:33.655
- Without you, there is no deal.
- Then I want it in writing.

24:33.747 --> 24:35.905
- Why can't I have an attorney?
- No time.

24:35.999 --> 24:38.455
There are bombers in the air to start a war.

24:38.543 --> 24:41.330
- You'll have to trust me.
- Why should I trust you?

24:41.421 --> 24:44.956
Why don't you have federal counsel
meet us wherever we're going?

24:45.050 --> 24:46.877
- Excuse me?
- One phone call.

24:46.968 --> 24:52.343
- That's right. We want federal counsel.
- No. I'm not trading with you, Alex.

24:52.432 --> 24:57.260
You're gonna do your demonstration,
then I help you. That's the deal. That's it.

25:01.483 --> 25:04.235
- I wanna talk to you in private.
- What are you doing?

25:04.319 --> 25:07.106
- I handled everything.
- What are you afraid of?

25:07.197 --> 25:10.530
I'm the one who can make this happen.
I wanna talk to him alone.

25:10.617 --> 25:14.531
OK, all right, whatever you want.
I'll be over here.

25:25.215 --> 25:27.706
- What's going on?
- Is she trying to screw me?

25:30.387 --> 25:35.132
- No. She's trying to help you.
- Why? I mean, she doesn't even know me.

25:35.767 --> 25:39.385
Maybe because she thinks
you got tricked into doing something

25:39.479 --> 25:41.306
you didn't fully understand.

25:41.398 --> 25:45.645
She wants to use her influence
with the president to try and help you.

25:45.735 --> 25:49.104
- Because she thinks I'm innocent?
- Yeah, maybe.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.909
And I think she likes me.

25:55.912 --> 25:58.582
I think she does.

26:25.942 --> 26:29.561
- Do you need any help?
- No, it should only be one suitcase.

26:32.699 --> 26:34.303
Take your time. I'll
be waiting in the car.

26:34.753 --> 26:35.750
Thanks.

27:11.238 --> 27:14.571
He just reassigned you?
He didn't give any explanation?

27:14.658 --> 27:19.320
Chappelle doesn't want me in the job. He's
got his own people, and I'm not one of them.

27:19.412 --> 27:23.161
What are you going to do?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.491
Tony, it's Satcom.

27:29.339 --> 27:31.711
- Almeida.
- This is David Palmer.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.373
Mr President, what can I do for you, sir?

27:34.469 --> 27:37.091
I need to speak to Bauer.
Can you reach him?

27:37.180 --> 27:40.632
- Can you hold on, sir?
- For a moment.

27:49.693 --> 27:51.769
- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Tony.

27:51.862 --> 27:55.562
- I have President Palmer on the line.
- OK, good. Patch him through.

27:55.657 --> 27:57.282
How we doing on the chopper?

27:57.367 --> 27:59.276
- Working on it.
- Work faster.

27:59.369 --> 28:04.245
Here's the President. Mr President,
I have Jack on the line. Jack, go ahead.

28:04.332 --> 28:05.957
Yes, Mr President.

28:06.042 --> 28:08.913
I don't know if you've heard,
but I've been unseated.

28:09.004 --> 28:10.284
Yes, I have. I'm sorry.

28:10.380 --> 28:12.788
Where are you on your investigation?

28:12.883 --> 28:15.800
I can tell you the Cyprus audio
has been forged.

28:15.886 --> 28:19.089
I have the man who engineered it.
I'm bringing him in soon.

28:19.181 --> 28:22.514
We'll patch him through to the
White House, so he can testify.

28:22.601 --> 28:26.301
Meanwhile, CTU is trying to process
everything they can on him.

28:26.396 --> 28:29.979
Mr President,
there is something else though.

28:30.066 --> 28:31.940
What?

28:32.027 --> 28:35.230
Your ex-wife, sir.
Sherry, she's here with me.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.729
How did that happen?

28:39.242 --> 28:42.576
- Jack?
- Yes, sir.

28:43.580 --> 28:45.786
- You can't talk?
- No, sir.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.783
Don't trust her, Jack. Do you understand?

28:49.878 --> 28:52.451
Yes, Mr President.

28:52.547 --> 28:55.501
- Let me talk to her.
- He wants to talk with you.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.348
- David?
- What are you trying to do?

29:04.434 --> 29:07.435
- I'm just trying to help you.
- How can you help me?

29:07.521 --> 29:09.893
You shouldn't have lied to me.

29:09.981 --> 29:13.813
That's the problem, David.
It's not always about the truth.

29:13.902 --> 29:15.729
And what's that supposed to mean?

29:15.821 --> 29:18.673
The truth is,
the Cyprus recording was forged.

29:18.773 --> 29:21.028
The truth is you are right
and they are wrong.

29:21.118 --> 29:24.451
The truth is, you're trying
to prevent an unnecessary war,

29:24.538 --> 29:28.120
and Jack Bauer and I are
the only ones who can help you.

29:28.834 --> 29:33.377
- Stay out of his way, Sherry.
- All right. All right, David.

29:33.463 --> 29:35.705
Let me talk to Jack.

29:40.345 --> 29:44.094
- Yes, Mr President?
- I need this man to come forward now.

29:44.182 --> 29:47.682
- I understand, sir.
- All right. Thank you.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.763
- Tony, you still there?
- I'm here.

29:50.856 --> 29:53.311
- How much time have we got?
- Six minutes.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.476
- Tony, can you hear me?
- Go ahead.

29:55.569 --> 29:58.486
- We need that chopper now.
- You'll have it.

29:58.572 --> 30:00.030
Thank you.

30:07.164 --> 30:09.370
I'm gonna need your help.

30:20.427 --> 30:23.048
I'm still here at the Matheson house.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.981
- Where is it, sir?
- Where is what?

30:40.363 --> 30:43.982
Please, David, don't make me do this.

30:44.868 --> 30:47.026
Give me the phone.

31:06.056 --> 31:10.136
- Place Pierce under arrest.
- Mike, don't.

31:10.227 --> 31:15.683
- I coerced him into getting it for me.
- You didn't coerce anyone.

31:15.774 --> 31:19.772
Shame on you,
for placing us both in this position.

31:19.861 --> 31:23.645
It should be you putting yourself
on the line. Instead, Aaron did.

31:23.740 --> 31:28.367
- I tried to be a friend to you, sir.
- I don't want a friend!

31:28.453 --> 31:31.490
I need someone to do the right thing.

31:35.127 --> 31:38.163
I'm sorry, Aaron.

31:38.255 --> 31:41.873
There's nothing to be sorry for,
Mr President.

33:01.797 --> 33:04.003
Officer, is that you?

33:18.230 --> 33:20.306
Hello?

33:29.616 --> 33:32.534
- Dessler.
- You ready?

33:32.619 --> 33:36.154
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

33:44.506 --> 33:47.258
- Yeah.
- Rudin needs you. He's in Holding Room 2.

33:47.342 --> 33:51.422
- Tell him to call me.
- The comm's out in that room.

33:51.513 --> 33:54.430
All right, I'm on my way.

34:20.750 --> 34:22.827
Where's Rudin?

34:32.888 --> 34:36.422
I got this.
Go send that chopper to pick up Jack.

34:57.996 --> 35:00.617
- When are your people getting here?
- Soon.

35:03.126 --> 35:08.583
It's not just out of my own selfish desire
that I'm trying to stay clean on all this.

35:08.673 --> 35:09.871
Really?

35:09.966 --> 35:14.842
It wouldn't be good for David's presidency
if his ex-wife was implicated in this bomb.

35:14.930 --> 35:17.765
So, now you care about his presidency?

35:19.309 --> 35:24.185
In light of what's happened today,
my resentments seem obscenely petty.

35:26.399 --> 35:30.065
I don't know what I was thinking.

35:30.153 --> 35:33.605
There's something I haven't
told you yet about Mr Palmer.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.691
- Mr Palmer?
- Yes, Mr Palmer.

35:38.078 --> 35:41.411
His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment
less than an hour ago.

35:41.498 --> 35:44.071
- What?
- Prescott's president now.

35:44.167 --> 35:47.002
Oh, my God.

35:47.838 --> 35:50.126
You got what you wanted. Yeah.

35:50.215 --> 35:53.666
It's Tony. The chopper's about
to leave. ETA's about 20 minutes.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.927
- So, Chappelle's on board with us?
- Not exactly.

35:57.013 --> 35:59.683
- What do you mean?
- It's better if you don't know.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.637
You'll have to get
the Attorney General involved.

36:02.727 --> 36:05.432
- What for?
- Mrs Palmer wants to cut a deal.

36:05.522 --> 36:08.095
- A deal?
- Hewitt's testimony incriminates her.

36:08.191 --> 36:11.441
- I'll make sure it's in place.
- It has to go like clockwork.

36:11.528 --> 36:14.612
- There's no margin for error.
- I know.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.817
What did you mean, "I want to cut a deal"?

36:20.912 --> 36:24.661
I explained to you that Alex won't say
anything without my permission.

36:24.749 --> 36:28.996
All I care about now is that
he convinces Prescott and the Joint Chiefs

36:29.087 --> 36:30.996
that he forged the Cyprus audio.

36:31.089 --> 36:33.439
After that,
you're free to try and cut a deal.

36:33.639 --> 36:35.466
That is not what we discussed.

36:35.552 --> 36:38.588
- I'm sorry, that's the way it is.
- We'll see about that.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.215
Mrs Palmer, the conversations end here.

36:42.309 --> 36:46.009
You don't talk to him again,
do you understand me?

36:46.897 --> 36:49.138
Don't try me, Mrs Palmer.

36:51.109 --> 36:53.944
Take a seat on the couch.

37:49.709 --> 37:51.785
Kim?

37:55.715 --> 37:58.289
You know this is all your fault, don't ya?

38:01.805 --> 38:06.597
Carla would probably still be alive
if it wasn't for you. Probably.

38:14.151 --> 38:17.235
You think I wanted to hurt her? I didn't.

38:18.613 --> 38:20.689
I loved her.

39:14.085 --> 39:17.585
- CTU. Dessler.
- This is Kim. I need to speak to my father.

39:17.672 --> 39:21.753
- Kim, your Dad's not here right now.
- Please find him. It's an emergency.

39:21.843 --> 39:24.002
All right, hold on.

39:33.855 --> 39:34.529
Yeah, Tony.

39:34.729 --> 39:36.940
No Jack, it's Michelle.
Your daughter's on the line.

39:37.025 --> 39:39.267
OK, fine. Put her through.

39:40.904 --> 39:42.778
- OK, Kim, go ahead.
- Dad.

39:42.864 --> 39:46.399
- Sweetheart, what's wrong?
- I'm at the Mathesons' house.

39:46.493 --> 39:49.494
Gary was here. He has a gun.

39:49.579 --> 39:52.551
He killed the officer
that brought me here.

39:52.751 --> 39:53.244
Where is he now?

39:53.333 --> 39:55.871
He's passed out. I knocked him out.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.665
- OK, get out of the house.
- What if I killed him?

39:58.755 --> 40:01.424
It doesn't matter.
Just get out of the house now.

40:01.508 --> 40:03.880
OK.

40:03.969 --> 40:06.211
Oh, God! No!

40:06.304 --> 40:08.511
- Kim, what's going on?
- He's moving.

40:08.598 --> 40:11.516
- Grab his gun.
- I've got it.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.231
- Shoot him.
- What?

40:18.316 --> 40:20.392
- Shoot him.
- I can't.

40:20.485 --> 40:23.937
I want you to point the gun at his chest
and pull the trigger.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.782
No, I can't.

40:26.867 --> 40:29.986
Kim, shoot him now!

40:30.078 --> 40:34.705
Kim. You little bitch.

40:37.252 --> 40:40.372
Kim! Kim!

40:41.256 --> 40:43.332
- Kim, can you hear me?
- Dad!

40:44.134 --> 40:47.467
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.

40:50.307 --> 40:53.640
Again. I want you to shoot him again.

40:58.648 --> 41:01.139
Shoot him again now, Kim.

41:02.444 --> 41:04.769
Shoot him again now!

41:32.933 --> 41:35.471
- Dad?
- Is he dead?

41:35.560 --> 41:38.312
- Yeah.
- OK, sweetheart, listen to me.

41:38.980 --> 41:43.274
I'll send someone to pick you up now.
Go downstairs and wait. Can you do that?

41:43.360 --> 41:46.776
- Yeah.
- OK, baby, hurry.

41:54.830 --> 41:57.321
- Where you going?
- I don't trust you any more.

41:57.415 --> 42:01.283
Everyone is looking to hunt you down:
Kingsley, the government.

42:01.378 --> 42:04.332
We can help you. Without us,
you don't stand a chance.

42:09.302 --> 42:11.710
- Hello?
- Kate, it's Jack Bauer.

42:11.805 --> 42:14.557
- Is everything all right?
- No. I need your help.

42:14.641 --> 42:17.476
My daughter was in a shooting,
I think she's in shock.

42:17.561 --> 42:20.431
Take the police officer
that I left behind with you,

42:20.522 --> 42:22.978
and go and pick her up
and take her over to CTU.

42:23.066 --> 42:27.395
- I'm sorry, Jack, I sent the officer home.
- Son of a bitch.

42:27.487 --> 42:31.651
- I don't know what else to do.
- I could do it. Go pick up Kim.

42:31.741 --> 42:33.200
- Can you?
- Yeah.

42:33.285 --> 42:37.365
Please call the police and tell them
to meet you at 12, Bluetree Drive.

42:37.456 --> 42:39.532
OK, do you know where it is?

42:39.624 --> 42:41.700
- Yeah.
- OK. I'll call CTU now.

42:41.793 --> 42:44.747
- OK, I'll leave right away.
- Please, Kate, hurry.

42:47.007 --> 42:48.834
- Get out of my way.
- No.

42:48.925 --> 42:52.377
Alex, get back to work!
Sherry, stay away from him!

42:52.971 --> 42:55.972
I need to speak to Tony Almeida
and Michelle Dessler.

42:56.057 --> 42:59.640
- Is it an emergency?
- Yes, it's an emergency.

42:59.728 --> 43:01.851
Alex, you...

43:08.820 --> 43:11.738
Alex!

43:12.783 --> 43:15.487
Help me.

43:18.246 --> 43:19.444
Alex!

43:20.305 --> 43:26.642
