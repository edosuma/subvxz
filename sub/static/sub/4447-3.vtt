Mom, what is this? It says
my scholarship was canceled.

00:05.458 --> 00:06.708
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:06.708 --> 00:08.083
I have one now.
For cheerleading.

00:08.083 --> 00:10.000
Hello, Marti.
Welcome to Cheertown.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.333
Vanessa, I'm sure you remember
the famous coach Red Raymond.

00:12.333 --> 00:14.625
So we're clear
I have a boyfriend.

00:14.625 --> 00:17.542
- Things change.
- Hi, I'm Vanessa Lodge.

00:17.542 --> 00:19.834
- My girlfriend.
- Nice to meet you.

00:19.834 --> 00:22.166
- Tighten up!
- Oh!

00:22.166 --> 00:24.667
Six weeks?
I'll miss qualifiers.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.208
Lewis asked Vanessa if he could
make you his permanent flyer.

Weren't they, like, a thing?

- No, I'm kidding. You look hot.

Why are you asking me, anyways?

Well, he's your friend
and I want it to go well.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.875
Believe it or not, I don't
get asked out that much.

Marti, come on.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.959
This is my first secular date.

01:33.959 --> 01:36.708
I'm used to group dates
stage-managed by my church.

01:36.708 --> 01:37.792
I'm sorry. It's just...

01:37.792 --> 01:39.750
[sighs]
It's weird.

01:39.750 --> 01:42.417
'I mean, you dating Dan
of all people.'

01:42.417 --> 01:44.708
All people?

01:44.708 --> 01:46.250
All people.
What does that even mean?

01:46.250 --> 01:48.291
Well, for one thing,
he's big and you're little.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.750
I mean, you two could be
Russian nesting dolls.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.917
But, um, mostly, he's...

01:53.875 --> 01:56.208
...he's a player.

01:56.208 --> 01:57.834
You're not the kind
of girl he dates.

01:57.834 --> 01:58.917
What kind of girl
does he date?

01:58.917 --> 02:00.875
Party girls, hookups.

02:00.875 --> 02:03.000
You're relationship material.
He's not used to that.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.792
Marti, why are you
being so negative?

02:08.917 --> 02:10.959
- Do you have a thing for Dan?
- What?

02:10.959 --> 02:13.000
- If you do, I'll back off.
- No.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.458
I don't wanna create drama
within the squad.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.291
Dan and I are just buds.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.917
I mean, we're friends.
You know? That's it, yeah.

02:20.750 --> 02:23.083
Look, I'm just saying manage
your expectations, you know.

02:23.083 --> 02:25.083
I-I know the guy.

02:26.458 --> 02:28.959
Well, thanks for the advice.

02:28.959 --> 02:31.708

02:32.834 --> 02:34.291
Get out here now, guys.

Vanessa's calling
an emergency meeting.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.333
Gather up, Hellcats.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.625
The university is pulling
our funding for regionals.

02:45.625 --> 02:48.333
Wait. What? Why?
We-we just qualified.

02:48.333 --> 02:52.500
The girls volleyball team
also qualified in their league.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.667
The school was paying
to send us and not them.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.291
The ladies didn't think
that was fair

02:56.291 --> 02:57.750
and they're filing a lawsuit
against the school.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.166
[scoffs]

02:59.166 --> 03:01.375
I hate them,
but that is genius.

03:01.375 --> 03:04.667
The NCAA recognizes
volleyball as a sport.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.959
'Cheerleading, not so much.'

03:06.959 --> 03:09.375
The university is looking
to avoid a legal fight

03:09.375 --> 03:12.000
and so they are reallocating
our funding to volleyball.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.583
So we can't move
to the next level?

03:13.583 --> 03:15.917
Well, we qualified,
so we're free to go

03:15.917 --> 03:18.166
providing that we can
figure out how to pay

03:18.166 --> 03:22.375
for our away uniforms,
entrance fees, travel.

03:23.625 --> 03:25.500
If we foot
the bill ourselves

03:25.500 --> 03:29.208
uh, it breaks down
to about ten grand.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.583
- Oh, my gosh.
- What, so that's it?

03:31.583 --> 03:33.834
- We're done?
- Oh, we're never done.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.708
(Vanessa)
'We're just moving on
to plan B.'

03:35.708 --> 03:39.750
There are two ways
to get to nationals.

03:39.750 --> 03:43.166
'We can go step-by-step
from regionals to sectionals'

03:43.166 --> 03:46.041
'all the way to nationals
building our routines.'

03:49.542 --> 03:52.375
Or since we don't have
the money we need

03:52.375 --> 03:56.083
the second option
is to submit a bid video

03:56.083 --> 03:59.041
directly to the national
organization.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.708
The competition's
a lot stiffer.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.375
But if we win a bid

04:02.375 --> 04:04.417
the national organization
pays our full freight.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.542
If it's free, why didn't we just
do that in the first place?

04:06.542 --> 04:08.875
- Well, because of you.
- Alice--

04:08.875 --> 04:11.041
It's the truth.

04:11.041 --> 04:13.458
Vanessa is afraid to put
an inexperienced flyer like you

04:13.458 --> 04:16.666
on video up against
the best stunters in the nation.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.416
Wow. Okay.

04:20.416 --> 04:23.375
Hey, look, we all have
total faith in you, Marti.

04:23.375 --> 04:26.083
And may I remind everyone
that if it wasn't for Marti

04:26.083 --> 04:27.708
we would not
have won at qualifiers.

04:27.708 --> 04:31.083
- Exactly.
- Yes. Marti! Whoo!

04:31.083 --> 04:32.750
(Alice)
'Come on, we all know
we're just marking time'

04:32.750 --> 04:34.375
until my wrist healed
enough for me to come back

04:34.375 --> 04:36.333
and take my rightful spot.

04:36.333 --> 04:39.000
Okay, it sucks
to be sidelined with an injury.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.750
I know, and I'm sorry, but your
wrist needs time to heal.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.750
My wrist is fine.
It doesn't even hurt anymore.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.750
If we're shooting a video,
you need me on that mat.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.083
You guys, tell her.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.208
Hey, um, look.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.583
I know this is the worst
possible timing

04:52.583 --> 04:54.792
but I can't be late
for this seminar again.

04:54.792 --> 04:57.125

as always.

didn't affect your claws.

to pay for her law classes.

on the mat, the better.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.250
(Julian)
Oh, Miss Perkins.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.500
In a court of law, what happens
when one party is late?

05:36.500 --> 05:39.333
The, um, late party
is held in contempt.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.625
That's correct.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.917
But that's not
the real punishment.

05:43.917 --> 05:47.125
Does anyone know what
the real punishment is?

05:47.125 --> 05:48.333
Mr. Pepper.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.959

05:49.959 --> 05:52.834

the outcome of your case

05:52.834 --> 05:54.500
they won't take you seriously.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.500
In the American justice system,
perception is reality--

05:57.500 --> 06:00.708
Please stop speaking,
Mr. Pepper.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.458

And we are gonna get him out.

students to help me

06:32.333 --> 06:35.917

and interviews and legwork.'

So sign your names
for consideration.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.417
You know, Harvard and Yale Law,
they love when they see

06:42.417 --> 06:44.417
'those kind of side projects
on a transcript.'

06:44.417 --> 06:47.041
Beware, this is not easy.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.208
You will work harder
than you ever have.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.750
And if there's any blood,
sweat or tears left at the end

06:52.750 --> 06:54.875
you're not doin' it right.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.875
It'll be the worst time
of your life

06:57.875 --> 06:59.834
but it'll also be the best.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.125
So if you are not serious...

07:08.417 --> 07:10.208
...do not bother.

Ow, ow, ow.
I'm, I'm coming down.

about the bid video?

The Third Circuit ruled
the three-strikes law

are political plutonium.

09:54.917 --> 09:57.875

But I need serious and committed

10:24.792 --> 10:27.291
The reason I'm a cheerleader's
because I need the scholarship.

10:27.291 --> 10:29.417

is you're overextended.

Oh. My dad is gonna kill me.

- The fighting?
- No, the fine.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.542
You know what, I could lose
my scholarship over this.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.458
Really?

26:30.458 --> 26:34.750
Yup, Lancer athletics'
code of conduct.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.875
Well, not to add
to your heap of woe

26:36.875 --> 26:39.750
but we're here
till we're arraigned

26:39.750 --> 26:43.250
which probably won't happen
till Monday, so...

26:43.250 --> 26:46.458
You sure know a lot
about getting arrested.

26:46.458 --> 26:49.708
- It's a family knack.
- What do you want?

26:49.708 --> 26:53.959
- We're Irish.
- Thanks, so...

26:53.959 --> 26:56.875
Marti tells me
you used to play football.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.959
Yeah, freshman year.

26:58.959 --> 27:00.625
I loved being on the field, bro.

27:00.625 --> 27:04.917
T-the strategy, the rush of
the game, working as a team.

27:04.917 --> 27:06.917
Why'd you quit?

27:06.917 --> 27:09.500
Uh, it was personal reasons.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.166
- Like?
- Like the personal kind.

27:12.166 --> 27:13.917
Okay.

27:13.917 --> 27:17.125
Uh, Lancer football just,
just wasn't for me, man.

27:20.458 --> 27:22.792
Why'd you switch
to cheerleading?

27:24.792 --> 27:27.959
I lost my football scholarship.
Needed a new one.

27:27.959 --> 27:31.000
Plus, I get to look up
girls' skirts all day long.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.542
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.959
Yeah.

27:35.959 --> 27:39.333
Look, I, uh, I haven't
got to thank you

27:39.333 --> 27:41.583
for jumping in that
fight back there, man.

27:41.583 --> 27:44.291
Hey, look, where I come from

27:44.291 --> 27:47.625
you don't jump into a fight
at the drop of a hat

27:47.625 --> 27:49.667
nobody bothers
to learn your name.

27:51.458 --> 27:54.000
I think you're a good dude,
Dan Patch.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.166
A good dude whose made some
bad decisions about his hair.

27:58.166 --> 28:00.792
But, uh, still
a good dude, bro.

28:00.792 --> 28:02.166

28:02.166 --> 28:04.875
(male #1)
They're right in here, coach.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.500
- I do appreciate this, Glenn.
- Well.

28:06.500 --> 28:09.166
Anything to help
the boys win next week.

28:09.166 --> 28:12.291
Uh, boys, it's been fun

28:12.291 --> 28:16.166
but looks like my ride's here,
so goodnight.

28:16.166 --> 28:19.959
- Don't be cocky, moron.
- Oh, uh, hey, uh, fellas.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.166
Hi, has Lewis Flynn
told you all

28:22.166 --> 28:24.166
how he's become
a cheerleader now?

28:24.166 --> 28:26.834
Uh-huh.
Uh, pompoms and everything.

28:26.834 --> 28:28.333
Lewis, what is
your new job called?

28:28.333 --> 28:31.166
Is it, is it catcher or base?

28:31.166 --> 28:32.583
Bottom bitch?
Do you go by bottom bitch?

28:32.583 --> 28:33.875
- Keep talking, man.
- Really?

28:33.875 --> 28:34.917
Did I stutter?

28:36.166 --> 28:37.250
You did not, sir.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.875
Goodnight.

28:43.708 --> 28:45.333
Go, jailbirds!

28:46.708 --> 28:48.583
I see why you quit.

28:54.667 --> 28:56.708
Okay, so according to this,
they won't be

28:56.708 --> 28:58.417
arraigned until Monday.

28:58.417 --> 29:00.500
If we can get them out now,
they won't go into the system.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.041
And Lewis keeps
his scholarship?

29:02.041 --> 29:04.208
Yeah. That's the theory.

29:04.208 --> 29:07.000
But we need a lawyer,
a pit bull.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.583
Now? In the middle
of the night?

29:08.583 --> 29:10.542
How do we do that?

29:10.542 --> 29:13.708
- Well, I have one idea.
- Yeah?

29:13.708 --> 29:15.458
Unfortunately,
it involves suicide.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.041
That doesn't sound very fun.

29:23.083 --> 29:25.375
Miss Perkins?

29:25.375 --> 29:27.083
I'm so sorry to be here
at your doorstep

29:27.083 --> 29:28.583
at this time of night
when I should be at home

29:28.583 --> 29:30.291
studying for your special
law assignment.

29:30.291 --> 29:32.917
Look, I know I'm blowing my shot
at your law clinic as we speak

29:32.917 --> 29:35.375
but right now, two of
my friends are in jail.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.250
One, well, he's gonna
lose his scholarship

29:37.250 --> 29:38.917
and the other,
he can't afford to pay.

29:38.917 --> 29:40.542
Technically, neither of them
can really afford to pay.

29:40.542 --> 29:41.708
Get to the point.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.500
We need your help.

29:51.583 --> 29:54.500
Sergeant, my name
is Julian Parrish.

29:55.291 --> 29:57.417
I know who you are.

29:57.417 --> 30:00.083
What brings a big gun like you
down here at this hour?

30:00.083 --> 30:02.458
Well, you have two of my clients
locked up in holding.

30:02.458 --> 30:04.583
I think I'd know if I had
a couple of your clients.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.333
Their names are
Dan Patch and Lewis Flynn.

30:07.333 --> 30:09.458
- Who?
- Couple of college students.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.125
They were brought in with
a bunch of football players.

30:11.125 --> 30:12.667
Oh, those two.

30:12.667 --> 30:15.917
Well, uh, I didn't realize
they had counsel.

30:15.917 --> 30:18.083
And, uh, just to be clear,
we haven't had any

30:18.083 --> 30:20.250
football players
in here in lockup, not--

30:20.250 --> 30:21.750
Are you sure about that?

30:21.750 --> 30:23.542
'Cause a bunch of people
saw them arrested

30:23.542 --> 30:24.959
down on Beale Street
earlier this evening.

30:24.959 --> 30:28.291
Oh. Well, they were, uh,
material witnesses.

30:28.291 --> 30:33.208
Ah. Well, in that case, could I
see their statements, please?

30:33.208 --> 30:36.583
You know, I-I really don't
have time for this. Alright?

30:36.583 --> 30:38.542
We're on a skeleton shift here

30:38.542 --> 30:40.834
what, with all
the damn budget cutbacks.

30:40.834 --> 30:44.166
Can you come back,
uh, uh, Monday?

30:47.291 --> 30:49.291
I'll be here with bells on.

30:49.291 --> 30:50.875
And I wanna thank you, sergeant

30:50.875 --> 30:52.667
from the bottom
of my withered lawyer's heart

30:52.667 --> 30:55.458
this is gonna be fantastic.

30:55.458 --> 30:56.959
- What do you mean?
- Well.

30:56.959 --> 30:58.708
Freeing the football players
while keeping my clients

30:58.708 --> 31:00.625
locked up, that's unequal
protection under the law

31:00.625 --> 31:03.166
and it's a violation
of their civil rights.

31:03.166 --> 31:06.166
And civil rights suits,
they get a lot of attention.

31:06.166 --> 31:09.083
Now, that's Burnett
with two Ts.

31:09.083 --> 31:10.625
I wanna make sure
I get your name right

31:10.625 --> 31:12.542
for the press conference,
we're gonna hold it

31:12.542 --> 31:15.667
right out here
on the front steps.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.667
But you know what the best
part's gonna be?

31:18.667 --> 31:21.041
Questioning Red Raymond himself
on the stand

31:21.041 --> 31:23.291
as a hostile witness.

31:23.291 --> 31:24.875
That is unparalleled
legal theater.

31:24.875 --> 31:27.375
And all the boosters
and the city fathers will know

31:27.375 --> 31:29.542
that Officer Burnett
with two Ts

31:29.542 --> 31:31.708
is the man that made it
all happen.

31:34.208 --> 31:35.458
Okay, counselor.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.834
What do you want?

31:46.375 --> 31:48.000
Oh, Marti, hey, look.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.917
- I-I owe you really huge.
- Hey, I'm your flyer.

31:50.917 --> 31:54.041
- It comes with the job, man.
- Yeah.

31:54.041 --> 31:56.041
I'm so sorry about
getting you arrested.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.208
You only got into that fight
because

31:57.208 --> 31:58.542
the football player
pushed me.

31:58.542 --> 32:02.708
Ah, it's not your fault,
I'm a born hero.

32:02.708 --> 32:05.667
I'm also sorry about
acting like such a freak.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.375
Clearly, I had nothing
to be nervous about.

32:07.375 --> 32:09.125
Well, not nothing,
I do have a certain

32:09.125 --> 32:10.417
street cred to maintain.

32:10.417 --> 32:12.750
Stop making jokes.

32:12.750 --> 32:15.583
I'm trying to thank you
for being so sweet.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.000
So thank you.

32:18.959 --> 32:20.291
You're welcome.

32:29.917 --> 32:32.083
Somebody's gotta
hold her hair. She's--

32:32.083 --> 32:35.875
If you see her getting sick,
it will scar her for life.

32:35.875 --> 32:38.834
- I'll call a cab. Yeah.
- 'Good, man.'

32:40.291 --> 32:42.458
Oh, hey. Thank you so much.

32:42.458 --> 32:43.834
I'm so sorry to drag you
down here like this.

32:43.834 --> 32:45.750
I hope you at least
learned something.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.750
I learned the cops around here
have no problem lying.

32:48.750 --> 32:50.750
Everyone lies.

32:50.750 --> 32:53.333
That's my first rule
for successful litigation.

32:53.333 --> 32:55.625
You look for the lie
and you make it work for you.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.291
- I won't ever forget it.
- Look, it's 6:00 am.

32:58.291 --> 32:59.500
Stop kissing my ass.

33:01.417 --> 33:03.750
And start thinking about
the assignment I gave you.

[grunting]

33:13.250 --> 33:15.333
Aah!

33:15.333 --> 33:16.750
Your back hurt?

33:16.750 --> 33:19.125
Yeah, I just slept on it wrong.

33:19.125 --> 33:22.250
No one forced you
to sleep on the sofa.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.708
Sit down.

33:25.708 --> 33:27.000
And just for the record,
I happened to

33:27.000 --> 33:30.458
fall asleep on the sofa,
I wasn't...

33:30.458 --> 33:32.667
You know, I wasn't trying
to make a statement.

33:32.667 --> 33:34.917
- You kinda were.
- Well, maybe a little one.

33:36.542 --> 33:37.750
Can we talk about it?

33:39.875 --> 33:43.667
Last night when I was sitting
there on the sofa stewing...

33:43.667 --> 33:46.208
...I actually started to wonder
if we had made a mistake

33:46.208 --> 33:47.834
moving in together so fast.

33:47.834 --> 33:50.667
No. We did not
make a mistake.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.625
I hope not.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.375
But what does it say
about our relationship

33:54.375 --> 33:58.000
that you actually felt like you
had to keep this from me?

33:58.000 --> 34:01.333
It says I messed up.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.959
And like I said, I'm sorry.

34:02.959 --> 34:05.250
But what was so awful, Vanessa?

34:05.250 --> 34:07.875
College girls hook up with
older men all the time, right?

34:07.875 --> 34:12.000
So what makes this one time
so horribly embarrassing?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.333
He had a wife. Emily.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.458
Oh.

34:19.083 --> 34:22.542
So how did it happen?
The affair?

34:22.542 --> 34:25.333
- Do you really wanna know?
- Yeah. Yeah, I wanna know.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.708
It had a big effect
on your life.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.083
I should know this stuff.

34:32.208 --> 34:35.708
Well, we'd been flirting
for a while.

34:35.708 --> 34:37.875
And one night,
I'm walking by his office

34:37.875 --> 34:39.375
and I stick my head in

34:39.375 --> 34:41.708
and he's going over tapes
of high school seniors

34:41.708 --> 34:44.542
who are applying
for football scholarships.

34:44.542 --> 34:47.458
And I'm there and he opens
a bottle of wine.

34:47.458 --> 34:51.875
And one thing leads
to another and...

34:52.917 --> 34:54.667
So how did it end?

34:57.417 --> 35:01.500
It ended the night
I finally met Emily.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.875
- The wife?
- Yeah.

35:03.875 --> 35:05.959
We were about a year
into our affair

35:05.959 --> 35:09.792
and it was at some dinner
for the athletic department

35:09.792 --> 35:14.000
and I didn't even realize
who she was at first.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.542
She was...

35:16.542 --> 35:19.750
...talking about
wanting kids and...

35:19.750 --> 35:22.417
She was really nice.

35:22.417 --> 35:25.625
And then Red walked up
and kissed her.

35:25.625 --> 35:29.125
And that's when
everything just came

35:29.125 --> 35:31.166
'crashing down
like a ton of bricks.'

35:31.166 --> 35:36.125
I mean, all the guilt
over what I had been doing.

35:36.125 --> 35:39.625
- Did you break it off?
- I did, but it was too late.

35:39.625 --> 35:43.250
The university found out that
Red was sleeping with a student

35:43.250 --> 35:48.083
and Bill Marsh covered it up,
but he forced Red to resign

35:48.083 --> 35:50.750
and Emily left him.

35:54.291 --> 35:57.000
- I ruined Red's life.
- Oh, hold on, Vanessa.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.834
Red knew exactly
what he was doing. Okay?

35:59.834 --> 36:01.792
Now he was in a position
of responsibility

36:01.792 --> 36:03.875
and you were nothing more
than a student.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.625
Well, he was 25.

36:05.625 --> 36:09.000
He was six years older than me.
We were kids.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.166
Stupid, reckless kids.

36:12.166 --> 36:15.834
And we hurt a woman
who didn't deserve it.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.667
So now you know.

36:22.667 --> 36:24.166
I do.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.458
Do you really think we made
a mistake moving in together?

36:29.458 --> 36:32.083
Oh.

36:32.083 --> 36:34.375
Not even close.

36:45.291 --> 36:48.458
Good morning, darlin'.
What's wrong, sugar?

36:48.458 --> 36:51.542
This special assignment
my law professor gave me.

36:51.542 --> 36:52.875
It's for a court case
that doesn't exist.

36:52.875 --> 36:54.708
- I've been looking all weekend.
- Oh.

36:54.708 --> 36:58.041
Well, I guess law classes
have everyone workin' overtime.

36:58.041 --> 37:01.083
- What do you mean?
- That hottie over there.

37:04.583 --> 37:07.041
Um, yeah, rule one,
never refer to anyone

37:07.041 --> 37:09.208
I have classes with
as a hottie.

37:09.208 --> 37:11.166
Rule two, never use
the word hottie.

37:11.166 --> 37:13.166
Ah. Hmm.

37:13.166 --> 37:14.208
Okay.

37:19.542 --> 37:21.291
Uh, you're,
you're Morgan, right?

37:21.291 --> 37:22.875
Yes.

37:22.875 --> 37:25.458
We're in Parrish's
law seminar together.

37:26.708 --> 37:28.166
'Oh, wow.
What's the big secret?'

37:28.166 --> 37:29.708
Nothing.

37:29.708 --> 37:32.041
I'm working on a private
assignment for Julian.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.041
Oh, well, yay for you.

37:34.041 --> 37:36.000
And I seriously doubt
he lets you call him Julian.

37:39.542 --> 37:41.625
By any chance,
is your special assignment

37:41.625 --> 37:44.125
Kobayashi v. Tennessee?

37:44.125 --> 37:46.583
How could you possibly
know that?

37:46.583 --> 37:49.333
That sneaky bastard.
Did he ask you to look it up?

37:49.333 --> 37:51.041
- You know, keep it a secret?
- Yeah.

37:51.041 --> 37:53.250
Was it after disparaging you
for being overextended?

37:53.250 --> 37:55.583
He disparaged me, but not for
being overextended.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.125
- He called me off-putting.
- Hmm.

37:57.125 --> 37:59.375
He said my face was punchable.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.166
He was kidding, obviously.

38:01.166 --> 38:03.000
So he made us all
feel like failures

38:03.000 --> 38:05.708
and then gave us one chance
to redeem ourselves.

38:07.291 --> 38:08.917
Basically,
it's an impossible assignment

38:08.917 --> 38:11.750
because there is no such case.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.750
Oh. Duh.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.458
- It's Kobayashi Maru.
- Huh?

38:16.458 --> 38:17.792
Kobayashi Maru
from "Star Trek."

38:17.792 --> 38:20.500
- The TV show?
- Ah, yes.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.792
And successful film franchise.

38:22.792 --> 38:24.834
Eighty five million
opening weekend?

38:24.834 --> 38:26.792
- Hello?
- Why would you know that?

38:26.792 --> 38:28.959
The Kobayashi Maru scenario
is a test

38:28.959 --> 38:31.125
that Starfleet Academy
gives its cadets.

38:31.125 --> 38:34.750
It's an impossible task to see
how you deal with failure.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.375
Why?

38:36.375 --> 38:39.208
Because only through failure
is true character revealed.

38:40.959 --> 38:44.125
You see, I don't do failure.

38:44.125 --> 38:46.125
Morgan, do you wanna help me
kick some ass?

Hopefully all of you realize

that the interview
wasn't just an interview.

39:23.792 --> 39:27.500
It was a test,
a test of character.

39:27.500 --> 39:31.208
'And what I hoped was to see
how you note-taking drones'

39:31.208 --> 39:34.333
react when faced
with an impossible task.

39:34.333 --> 39:38.208
Who would rise
to the challenge?

39:38.208 --> 39:40.291
Who of you could surprise me?

39:40.291 --> 39:42.208
Actually, Kobayashi v. Tennessee
does exist.

39:42.208 --> 39:44.542
Yeah. Surprise.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.542
No, I invented it.
Kobayashi isn't a real name.

39:46.542 --> 39:48.208
It's a reference
to a fictional--

39:48.208 --> 39:50.708
Yeah, yeah, "Star Trek,"
85 million opening

39:50.708 --> 39:53.708
nerds rule the Earth,
mm-hmm.

39:53.708 --> 39:57.000
You two created a case
called Kobayashi v. Tennessee.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.083
We reprogrammed the scenario
just like Jim Kirk.

39:59.083 --> 40:00.667
We filed it on behalf of

40:00.667 --> 40:02.542
Charlie Kobayashi
of Hickory Withe, Tennessee.

40:02.542 --> 40:04.208
Hickory Withe needs street lamps

40:04.208 --> 40:06.166
and Mr. Kobayashi
has taken up the cause.

40:06.166 --> 40:08.750
You lied about the case
and we made the lie work for us.

40:10.375 --> 40:14.750
To be clear, what you did was
not the conduct

40:14.750 --> 40:16.417
of a proper lawyer.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.500
And I hate proper lawyers.

40:21.875 --> 40:23.917
You're in.

40:23.917 --> 40:25.625
'My law clinic starts Monday.'

40:27.917 --> 40:30.291
- Oh, just.
- Right. Okay.

40:40.583 --> 40:43.125
Give them to me.

40:43.125 --> 40:45.750
- Give what to you?
- The drugs.

40:45.750 --> 40:48.708
- I saw Jake give them to you.
- Well, you saw wrong.

40:48.708 --> 40:51.291
Every single one of those guys
is on something.

40:51.291 --> 40:54.041
And I know you've been
practicing with a hurt wrist.

40:54.041 --> 40:56.250
So what did he
give you? Hmm?

40:56.250 --> 40:58.875
HGH? Steroids, Alice?

40:58.875 --> 41:01.291
- Painkillers? What?
- Oh.

41:01.291 --> 41:04.625
So all of a sudden, you care.

41:04.625 --> 41:06.166
We may not be together,
but that doesn't mean

41:06.166 --> 41:08.458
I wanna see bad things
happen to you, okay?

41:08.458 --> 41:10.500
Now trouble follows Jake.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.458
You should really
steer clear of him.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.125
So you do care.

41:22.458 --> 41:24.208
Good to know.
