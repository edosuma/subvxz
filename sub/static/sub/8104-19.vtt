WEBVTT

00:37.246 --> 00:38.830
Visualizing?

00:39.665 --> 00:41.999
All right. You're up, tiger.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.962
You feel all right?
You look a little pale.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.463
I'm fine.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.673
Does your neck still hurt?

00:48.799 --> 00:50.049
It'll be fine.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.135
Maybe you should do
the two-and-a-half instead.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.469
I'm gonna do the three.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.555
Well, it's better to nail
the two-and-a-half...

00:55.681 --> 00:57.724
I'm gonna nail the three.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.060
All right.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.020
Well, let's show these senior citizens

01:03.147 --> 01:05.481
what a well-coached
12-year-old can do, huh?

01:21.957 --> 01:25.793
Next diver, two-time
national junior champion, Mary Carroll.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.316
Damn it.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.777
You can do this. Come on, just...

01:50.903 --> 01:53.070
See it. See it.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.586
Big jump. Pike out. Rip it.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.742
Call 911. We need an ambulance.

03:47.686 --> 03:48.728
I saw the light on.

03:48.854 --> 03:49.937
It's daytime.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.773
Yeah, it's a figure of speech.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.775
Always so literal.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.697
Got a new cane.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.450
Yeah.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.911
Guy in the store said it was slimming.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.871
Vertical stripe.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.748
Why are you here?

04:08.874 --> 04:10.082
Vogler is dead.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.126
What? What happened?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.337
Again with the literal translation.

04:14.463 --> 04:15.880
Vogler, the idea.

04:16.006 --> 04:19.008
Mr. Destructo, Mr. Moneybags.
"Bow down before me."

04:19.134 --> 04:21.260
He is gone from the hospital.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.304
So things can go back
to the way they were.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.890
The way they were was kind of weird.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.308
Hmm.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.602
Weird works for me.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.938
What are you saying? Literally.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.149
I want you to come back.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.609
Why?

04:41.990 --> 04:45.117
Please unclench.
You're not on the clock,

04:45.243 --> 04:47.995
and when you do that, I clench,
and then it's a whole thing.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.498
Could you look at your pager?

04:56.630 --> 04:59.840
It's no big deal. Some sort of
epidemic. Not my area.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.384
You should go. It's important.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.844
What I'm doing now is important.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.554
Why do you want me back?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.306
Because you're a good doctor.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.519
That's it?

05:11.645 --> 05:12.770
That's not enough?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.023
Not for me.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.279
Go deal with your plague.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.748
You are in a quarantined area.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.042
Please remain calm and stay in line.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.586
A doctor will see you shortly.

05:37.713 --> 05:41.507
When you see a doctor,
you will receive a blue or yellow form.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.386
Patients with blue forms must
immediately exit to the parking lot.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.431
Dr. House. Need you here.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.018
Sorry. Lot of sick people.
I might catch something.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.145
A judge at the campus pool center
collapsed.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.106
LP revealed a virulent form of
bacterial meningitis.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.108
Great. You got it diagnosed.
You don't need me.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.361
2,500 people at the pool center
were exposed.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.613
They're being bussed to
all the neighboring hospitals.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.199
That's a problem with resources,
not diagnostics.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.910
I'd be completely lost,
get in everyone's way.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.539
Joe, Dr. House doesn't have
a blue slip.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.625
No one leaves the quarantine area
without a blue slip.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.294
You are a doctor at this hospital.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.670
Act like one.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.047
And...

06:22.716 --> 06:23.924
...take these.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.726
102.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.605
You win a trip to the second floor.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.939
Next.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.238
All right. No fever. No rash.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.116
You're fine. Take these two pills,

06:49.826 --> 06:53.162
and show this blue slip to Security
on your way out.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.581
Next.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.041
Take these. Go home.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.001
Talk to your daughter.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.419
What?

07:00.921 --> 07:04.173
Your pants, your blouse, your scarf
are all freshly dry cleaned.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.675
Everything except your jacket.
It's got a smudge on it.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.511
Probably two days old.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.513
Which means you didn't know
the jacket had been worn.

07:10.639 --> 07:14.058
So either your husband is
a cross-dresser,

07:14.184 --> 07:16.936
or your daughter's been borrowing
your clothes without telling you.

07:17.062 --> 07:20.856
She probably wants to look older
to get into bars.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.234
I don't have a daughter.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.489
Next.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.117
So I have it?

07:31.243 --> 07:32.576
Take the yellow form
to the second floor.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.161
- You're gonna be fine.
- I'm gonna die.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.790
It's treatable, as long as
you go to the second floor.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.792
Next.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.174
Fever. Does that mean I have it?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.927
Do you have a rash? Come on.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.224
It's from my new bathing suit.
I've had it a week.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.892
Yeah.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.269
Does your neck hurt?

07:58.395 --> 07:59.520
If it does, you hit the trifecta.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.065
It's nothing. I pulled it trying to do
a three-and-a-half tuck.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.608
Where are your parents?

08:04.734 --> 08:05.860
We live in Chicago.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.903
I'm here with my coach.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.120
I wanted to see what you were writing.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.664
Go like this.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.713
Go like this.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.470
Take these pills.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.015
Blue slip will get you out of here.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.976
Next.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.104
You're coming with me.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.566
Proceed to the second
floor for further examination.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.903
You're gonna need a CT scan.
Second floor.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.696
Take the elevators, follow the parade.

08:50.822 --> 08:51.697
Next.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.662
Maybe it's something systemic.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.664
Or maybe it's meningitis.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.957
She's had the rash a week.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.210
If it was this meningitis,
she'd be dead by now.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.878
You guys figure we're done down there?

09:06.004 --> 09:09.089
The 800 people milling around are
just waiting for the bathroom?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.674
12-year-old female.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.344
Fever, rash, neck pains.
Not meningitis.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.137
It's the definition of meningitis.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.931
Sure. Pus in the spinal canal

09:17.057 --> 09:18.432
makes it hurt to move your head
up and down,

09:18.558 --> 09:20.351
but her neck only hurts
moving side to side.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.560
Oh, side to side.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.603
Doesn't fit.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.939
The three of you, lobby, now.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.775
Those little pills
you're passing out so efficiently

09:27.901 --> 09:29.777
aren't gonna do Miss Louganis squat.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.654
You just don't want to deal with
the epidemic.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.656
That's right.
I'm subjecting a 12-year-old

09:33.782 --> 09:35.783
to a battery of dangerous
and invasive tests

09:35.909 --> 09:37.493
to avoid being bored.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.456
Okay, maybe I would do that.
But I'm not.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.583
If it turns out she's got meningitis,
you're right, you win,

09:44.709 --> 09:46.502
but if we go back downstairs
and she dies,

09:47.879 --> 09:49.922
your face will be so red.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.842
You have one hour.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.053
Get a lumbar puncture.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.722
Some brain infections can be
pretty clever at hide-and-seek.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.682
I'll get on her blood work.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.016
No, you won't.

10:01.142 --> 10:04.603
You, sir, will research all the causes
in the universe of neck pain.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.064
The list is, like, two miles long.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.565
Start with the letter "A."

10:08.692 --> 10:10.359
And put her on rifampin.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.069
Rifampin is for meningitis.
You just said...

10:12.195 --> 10:13.988
In case I'm wrong.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.906
It has happened.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.674
Brenda, I need a CBC CHEM-7 in 2046.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.259
Hold on.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.593
Excuse me. Excuse me.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.012
Hey, there's a line here.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.514
That's why I said excuse me.
Brenda, I need a bed and...

10:40.640 --> 10:41.557
We all need stuff.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.559
Push me again.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.561
Brenda, I need a bed and a nurse
for a lumbar puncture.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.855
No beds, no nurses
for at least four hours.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.898
- I've only got one.
- Your patient only has an hour to live

10:50.025 --> 10:52.526
unless she gets a lumbar puncture?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.737
Cuddy only gave us an hour
to work on the patient.

10:54.863 --> 10:55.946
Back of the line.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.536
Do not leave
the quarantine area

11:02.662 --> 11:04.621
until you have been seen by a doctor.

11:04.748 --> 11:08.542
When you see a doctor,
you will receive a blue or yellow form.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.546
This Novocaine will numb you
for the lumbar puncture.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.840
Sorry this has to be so public, Mary.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.469
Normally I'm in a bathing suit
with 5,000 people staring at my butt.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.387
I can block this out.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.182
These kids are all very mature.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.352
Travel around the country
from event to event.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.397
Okay, I want you to hold your knees
and tuck your head.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.565
Like a dive?

11:31.691 --> 11:32.775
Exactly.

11:33.985 --> 11:38.572
Good. Great. Don't forget to breathe.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.410
All right.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.871
Sorry.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.082
Jeez. Coach, help me out here.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.627
Play a little defense
before I poke the wrong thing.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.800
Okay, here we go.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.680
I feel it.
I feel it. I feel...

12:03.807 --> 12:05.641
Try to relax, Mary. Try to relax.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.309
Relax.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.694
What letter are you up to?

12:18.655 --> 12:19.738
"A."

12:19.864 --> 12:22.825
Torture combing through all that stuff,
ain't it?

12:22.951 --> 12:25.160
Real dull. Awful.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.787
It's no problem.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.164
Well, thank goodness.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.459
A lot of people would resent
having to do this.

12:37.799 --> 12:41.677
If you receive
a blue form, please exit the area.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.930
If you receive a yellow form,
please proceed to the second floor.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.932
Where's the 12-year-old girl
that was here?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.392
Needed the gurney.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.019
She just had a lumbar puncture.
She's not supposed to be moved.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.729
Sorry. We needed the gurney.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.324
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.201
You okay? How's your head feeling?

13:06.327 --> 13:08.078
She's got a headache and she's dizzy.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.582
She shouldn't have been moved
after the procedure. I'm sorry.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.002
I'm fine. What did the test show?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.254
No meningitis and no other infections.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.549
But you're not carrying a blue form.

13:20.675 --> 13:21.884
I have something else, don't I?

13:22.010 --> 13:24.219
Something's causing your symptoms.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.846
We're gonna keep you here overnight.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.389
I know it's a little crazy in here,

13:27.515 --> 13:28.640
but hopefully it'll settle down

13:28.766 --> 13:31.226
and we'll be able to get you a room.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.563
I'm sorry.

13:34.689 --> 13:37.816
I'm not usually all emotional
like this. I just...

13:39.861 --> 13:41.445
You're doing great.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.197
Your folks land in a few hours.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.908
I just... I haven't slept.
I'm so tired.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.913
Oh, my God. My eye's bleeding.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.081
What is it? What's happening?

13:56.878 --> 13:58.420
Oh, don't worry.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.130
The antibiotic we gave you

14:00.256 --> 14:03.592
in case you had meningitis
can turn your tears reddish.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.260
That's not blood.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.020
But that...

14:17.273 --> 14:18.941
That's blood.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.783
That's going into my stomach?

14:27.909 --> 14:29.910
The lavage showed blood
in your GI tract.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.246
We need to find where it's coming from.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.706
You won't feel it. I'm gonna numb
the back of your throat,

14:34.832 --> 14:38.001
and Dr. Foreman is gonna give you
a sedative. Open.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.506
Swallow.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.924
Now lay on your side for me.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.095
And here we go.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.601
Yell "fire" or something.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.728
People, this area is highly contagious.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.523
Please step back. Highly contagious.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.902
All right. Try to relax, Mary.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.821
This shouldn't take too long.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.908
I don't see any tears or lesions.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.830
All right. I'm in her stomach.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.332
There's no bleeding.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.167
There was more than a tablespoon of
blood in the mouth,

15:19.294 --> 15:20.460
so it's gotta be there.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.671
Maybe her small intestine.

15:22.797 --> 15:23.922
30 feet of digestive tract.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.008
It could be anywhere in there.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.011
We're not gonna see it with this.

15:30.763 --> 15:35.267
Believe it or not, this is a camera.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.856
You swallow it, and it goes
all the way through your system.

15:40.982 --> 15:44.443
The antennae pick up
the signal from the pill.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.903
Then we look at the video of
your intestines,

15:47.030 --> 15:49.948
see where the blood is coming from,
and fix it.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.868
All right? Water?

15:52.994 --> 15:54.911
Down the hatch.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.176
Think I've seen this movie.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.054
The ending's kind of dark.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.139
You want one?

16:16.142 --> 16:18.393
How come you did the endoscopy?

16:18.895 --> 16:19.728
He asked for help.

16:19.854 --> 16:20.937
Her blood pressure was high.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.273
- I was worried...
- Foreman is not your boss.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.984
When I tell you to do something...

16:26.319 --> 16:29.363
Whoa. Hold it there.
Back it up a couple of frames.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.285
Oh, yeah. That's your money shot.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.163
I don't see anything. Really?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.706
Ginormous thing on the right side

16:39.832 --> 16:41.416
of her intestine.
That doesn't intrigue you?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.419
Does "ginormous" mean really big,
or really, really small?

16:44.545 --> 16:45.712
'Cause I don't see anything.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.881
There? The Dieulafoy?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.467
Oh. Well, we can burn off
the swollen blood vessel,

16:50.593 --> 16:52.844
but it still doesn't account for
her other symptoms.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.806
No, but it does tell us something.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.808
Though I have no idea what.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.560
Could be a precursor to
intestinal intussusception.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.398
Precursor isn't causing
all her other symptoms. What else?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.901
You, in the lobby now.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.820
I hurt my leg. I have a note.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.864
You had your hour. Three, actually.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.326
Dr. Chase, I told you to tell us
when our time was up.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.372
- She has intestinal bleeding.
- She'll wait.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.833
Two more buses just arrived.
We need you downstairs.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.962
No, you need more nurses,
but you cut back on the nursing staff,

17:27.088 --> 17:29.423
so now you've got doctors doing
what nurses should be doing.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.882
That's true.

17:31.008 --> 17:35.554
I wonder if that has anything to do
with you costing us $100 million.

17:40.768 --> 17:44.521
Attention.
If you do not have a blue form,

17:44.647 --> 17:48.275
you will not be allowed to leave
the quarantined area.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.651
Go. Be free.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.779
If it's not the intussusception,
what about stomach cancer?

17:52.905 --> 17:53.864
Does she have
any abdominal pain?

17:53.990 --> 17:54.823
No.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.867
Then it's not stomach cancer.
Have you ruled out sepsis?

17:56.993 --> 17:59.578
The LP and blood smears showed
no signs of infection.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.413
Here. Take these two pills
and you can go.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.373
Well, the lab's working
at double their capacity.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.791
Maybe someone screwed up.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.169
No fever, no neck pain.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.754
Take the elevator to the third floor.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.046
Wrong form.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.716
No fever, no neck pain. She's fine.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.218
Smell her hair. No chlorine.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.887
Which means she wasn't at the pool,

18:17.013 --> 18:18.930
which means she's come to
a quarantined area

18:19.056 --> 18:22.225
because she's an idiot or she's insane.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.727
No one is that stupid.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.104
East wing, psych ward. Bye-bye.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.692
Neck pain could be a symptom
for bone cancer.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.861
You up to the "B's"? Well done.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.113
That would account for
all her meningeal symptoms,

18:35.239 --> 18:36.656
rash, fever.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.700
You're fine. Take these two pills.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.869
Get a sample of her bone marrow.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.205
- From here?
- Break time.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.831
I need more than 15 minutes.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.500
Use Chase's break, too.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.836
Go.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.965
You should just fire Chase.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.051
What, and miss out on all this fun?

18:56.177 --> 18:58.386
So you're gonna torture him for a while
and then fire him?

18:58.513 --> 19:00.764
- That's cold.
- You don't think he has it coming?

19:00.890 --> 19:02.682
Hey, I said fire him.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.226
That's cold.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.394
- All he did was save his job.
- What?

19:06.521 --> 19:08.939
He completely screwed you over.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.566
Right rudder.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.611
Bank, bank, bank.

19:14.737 --> 19:15.779
Good coffee?

19:15.905 --> 19:19.324
The rest of this hospital is busting
its tail, and you're...

19:19.450 --> 19:20.492
What are you doing?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.494
Trying to think of anything
except the produce department

19:22.620 --> 19:24.663
at Whole Foods.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.915
I am working. It got hot.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.708
Stop acting like a 13-year-old.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.836
Sorry.
You just don't usually see breasts

19:30.962 --> 19:32.295
like that on deans of medicine.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.715
Oh, women can't be heads of hospitals?
Or just ugly ones?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.425
No, they can be babes.

19:37.552 --> 19:40.053
It's just you don't usually see
their fun bags.

19:41.055 --> 19:44.724
Your 3:00 interview for Dr. Cameron's
position is in your office.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.685
Not interviewing today.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.145
I don't know if you've heard,
but there's this big-time epidemic.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.731
Many sick people puking
in the hallways. It's crazy.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.483
I'll send the interview home.
We can reschedule.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.776
No, you won't.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.403
You will interview this person.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.572
And if he can put
two sentences together,

19:58.698 --> 20:01.658
you will send him to the lobby
where he will do his job.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.159
Unlike the two of you.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.372
Come on.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.875
You know I can't do a bone marrow
aspiration in the hallway.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.835
And I can't give you a procedure room.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.588
I just need something at least close to
a sterile environment.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.965
I need 10 more nurses.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.509
Brenda, listen. Listen. She'll die.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.345
At least she'll have a bed, then.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.014
Put that over there.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.942
Are there dead people
in those cabinets?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.696
I hope that's who's in there.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.416
Just be calm. Relax.

21:00.843 --> 21:06.765
Hang on.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.396
You know, I really admire the way

21:13.522 --> 21:14.606
you don't care what anyone thinks.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.859
You just do what you want,
the way you want.

21:19.028 --> 21:22.280
So you went to Hopkins for
both undergrad and med school?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.783
- That's right.
- He's in a band.

21:26.327 --> 21:27.911
You're into music?

21:28.037 --> 21:29.788
Totally.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.414
What kind of music do you play?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.249
Mostly blues, you know,

21:33.376 --> 21:35.377
James Cotton, some original stuff.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.755
Oh, dude, you are so hired.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.423
Really?

21:40.549 --> 21:41.758
Not a chance.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.011
- Why?
- Tattoo.

21:47.640 --> 21:52.352
Wow. I thought you'd be the last person
to have a problem with nonconformity.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.895
Nonconformity. Right.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.398
I can't remember the last time I saw
a 20-something kid

21:56.524 --> 21:58.191
with a tattoo of
an Asian letter on his wrist.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.026
You are one wicked freethinker.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.487
You want to be a rebel?
Stop being cool.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.281
Wear a pocket protector like he does,
and get a haircut,

22:05.408 --> 22:08.159
like the Asian kids who don't leave
the library for 20-hour stretches.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.746
They're the ones who don't care
what you think.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.998
Sayonara.

22:20.881 --> 22:24.134
So, should I go through all the résumés
looking for Asian names?

22:24.260 --> 22:27.095
Actually, the Asian kids are probably
just responding to parental pressure,

22:27.221 --> 22:29.431
but my point is still valid.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.768
So when do they think
you're getting out of here?

22:33.894 --> 22:35.145
They don't know.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.771
You don't look sick.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.816
Better hope you're not. This equipment
looks like it's 100 years old.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.860
Just got it out of storage.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.821
It is the previous generation,
but it works just fine.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.657
Could you...
Could you guys give us a second?

22:47.783 --> 22:50.326
If it's good news, you can tell them.

22:50.453 --> 22:54.330
Okay. We're pretty sure
it's not cancer.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.915
Hey, that's great.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.208
I'll call your parents.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.543
Well, we still can't release her.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.879
We still don't know yet
exactly what's causing the...

23:05.843 --> 23:08.553
Mary? What's wrong?

23:08.679 --> 23:10.847
She's having an absence seizure.
Mary? You okay?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.140
She looks fine.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.600
I need some help over here.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.518
Push two milligrams Ativan, stat.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.541
Are you sure it was an absence seizure?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.919
Absolutely.
She was totally unresponsive

23:41.045 --> 23:43.963
and unaware of
what was going on around her.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.218
Do you mind? We're trying to work.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.470
We should get back out there.
Cuddy's gonna be looking for us.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.014
Looking, but not finding.
Did you do an EEG?

23:53.140 --> 23:54.682
Seizure frequency is increasing.

23:54.809 --> 23:56.684
They're almost constant now.
Five in the last half hour.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.770
- Which tells us...
- It's definitely in her brain.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.647
And it's getting worse.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.689
And?

24:02.983 --> 24:06.361
Good Lord. Are you having
a bowel movement or a baby?

24:06.487 --> 24:08.071
Could be
barbiturate withdrawal.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.489
No, it can't be drugs.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.574
She's tested at every meet
she competes at.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.576
A bleed in the brain
could cause seizures.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.662
Rat poison?
Could also cause the neck pain.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.373
You think she's eating off the floor of
her folks' garage?

24:18.499 --> 24:20.250
Doesn't have to be.

24:20.918 --> 24:23.128
Who would poison a 12-year-old?

24:23.254 --> 24:26.381
Well, let's see, now.
There's the 18-year-old has-been

24:26.507 --> 24:27.674
that she beat out to make Nationals,

24:27.800 --> 24:32.512
the has-been's parents, jealous
siblings, sociopathic swim fan,

24:32.638 --> 24:35.765
and then there's just your plain
old garden-variety wack job.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.731
Hey.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.317
You know what a hemorrhoid is?

24:46.443 --> 24:49.279
- No.
- Well, Google it.

24:49.405 --> 24:52.699
And try some Raisin Bran
instead of the donuts.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.287
Do a CT scan.
Check for intercranial bleeding.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.831
Not a chance.
Radiology's totally swamped.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.624
If our patient's bleeding
into her brain,

25:01.750 --> 25:02.834
she's gonna be dead in eight hours.

25:02.960 --> 25:07.005
She could be, but a meningitis patient
will be without a CT scan.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.383
When I was in med school,
I had this old professor...

25:10.509 --> 25:13.469
Who touched you in the naughty place?

25:13.596 --> 25:15.430
Before the CT scan was introduced,

25:15.556 --> 25:17.724
he specialized
in transcranial ultrasound.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.517
Hmm.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.937
Ancient, but if there's enough bleeding
it might work.

25:23.063 --> 25:26.900
Okay, do what the guy who didn't
specialize in neurology said.

25:27.902 --> 25:28.985
It was my idea.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.364
You've still gotta cover "Q" to "Z."

25:42.208 --> 25:45.627
Sorry I'm late. I was taking a dump.

25:46.754 --> 25:47.629
I'm guessing I'm better off

25:47.755 --> 25:51.007
interviewing right after
than right before.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.760
Dr. Petra Gilmar, Dr. Gregory House.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.595
You actually speak four languages,

25:55.721 --> 25:59.098
or are you just banking on never
being interviewed by anyone who does?

25:59.225 --> 26:02.143
It's true, and I can swear in two more.

26:03.145 --> 26:05.438
Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.232
Did you fall for him
and can't handle it,

26:07.358 --> 26:08.942
or was it the other way around?

26:09.068 --> 26:11.319
Yes, well, pretty much every fellowship
ends that way.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.528
No, it was nothing like that.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.697
- You Jewish?
- Yes.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.866
Is it true what they say about
Jewish foreplay?

26:16.992 --> 26:19.077
- Two hours of begging?
- I heard four.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.746
Well, actually, I'm only half Jewish.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.335
Look, I know you like to play games
with people.

26:27.461 --> 26:30.255
I know you like to say outrageous
things and study how they react.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.799
What you should know about me is
that I grew up with four brothers.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.592
Keep your hands to yourself,

26:34.718 --> 26:37.887
I'm okay with anything
that comes out of your mouth.

26:39.139 --> 26:42.725
Uh... Well, that's great.
I think that's all we need.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.811
Thank you for coming by. Thank you.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.827
That's our Hitler!

27:00.953 --> 27:02.578
No way.

27:02.705 --> 27:04.872
Are you kidding?
Her background's perfect.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.500
She's smart, she can obviously deal
with your insanity.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.544
- Did you see her shoes?
- Her shoes?

27:09.670 --> 27:11.129
What, did your horoscope in Vogue

27:11.255 --> 27:12.755
tell you to avoid women
wearing green shoes?

27:12.881 --> 27:17.468
The eyes can mislead, a smile can lie,
but the shoes always tell the truth.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.678
They were Prada.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.014
- Means she has good taste.
- They were not Prada.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.641
You wouldn't know Prada
if one stepped on your scrotum.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.269
Okay. Well, they were nice. Pointy.

27:26.395 --> 27:29.689
Exactly. They were stylish,
and very painful to wear.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.066
Only an incredibly shallow,
insecure woman

27:32.192 --> 27:33.693
would rather be in pain all day long

27:33.819 --> 27:35.361
than wear a decent-looking,
comfortable shoe,

27:35.487 --> 27:37.697
and that's exactly the type
I don't need around here.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.532
No. Someone who can handle
a lot of pain

27:39.658 --> 27:41.868
is exactly the type you do need.

27:58.552 --> 27:59.802
Excuse me.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.985
What are you doing?

28:58.112 --> 29:00.071
I'm ultrasounding your head.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.281
You're still having seizures.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.368
This should help us figure out
what's going on.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.415
Blue form to the security guard.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.291
You're not gonna be happy with anyone.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.127
So, what, your advice is

29:14.253 --> 29:16.546
hire someone I'm not happy with
and be happy?

29:16.672 --> 29:18.339
No, my advice is much more subtle.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.841
Stop being an ass.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.635
You always find some tiny little flaw
to push people away.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.928
Oh, now it's people.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.638
I thought we were talking about
fellowship applicants.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.014
You have a history of this.

29:27.141 --> 29:28.891
Well, when I do decide
to push you away,

29:29.017 --> 29:30.768
I hope there's a small person
kneeling behind you,

29:30.894 --> 29:32.562
so you fall down and hurt your head.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.313
Take these. There's water over there.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.983
Blue form to the guard.
And you're done.

29:37.526 --> 29:41.612
You had the perfect person,
and you blew it.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.364
You saw the shoes.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.491
I'm not talking about her.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.909
You're talking about Cameron.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.871
I'm talking about every woman
you've ever given a damn about.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.248
Cameron is so not perfect.

29:52.374 --> 29:53.624
Well, nobody's perfect.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.042
Mother Teresa?

29:55.169 --> 29:56.419
Dead.

29:56.545 --> 29:57.628
Angelina Jolie?

29:57.754 --> 29:59.797
- No medical degree.
- Now who's being picky?

29:59.923 --> 30:02.675
You're gonna wind up alone, House.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.428
You were right. There's a significant
bleed in her temporal lobe.

30:05.554 --> 30:06.512
But no poisons.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.681
Did tox screens on her blood,
urine, and hair.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.766
Nothing. Did them twice.

30:10.893 --> 30:11.893
He's a little dehydrated.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.686
Put him on a saline drip
and give him some orange juice.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.147
I need an operating room
and a neurosurgeon.

30:16.273 --> 30:19.108
Oh, well. Given the current crisis,
I'm tempted to say no,

30:19.234 --> 30:21.194
but since you've been so sweet to me
today...

30:21.320 --> 30:24.655
Our little mermaid is bleeding
into her temporal lobe.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.617
- How fast can you have her prepped?
- 20 minutes.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.536
You'll have a surgeon
in the room in 10.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.514
Mr. and Mrs. Carroll?

30:49.640 --> 30:51.182
Are you Dr. House?

30:51.308 --> 30:52.934
This is Dr. Foreman.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.519
Is Mary all right?

30:54.645 --> 30:56.354
The operation went well.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.772
The intracranial pressure's been
relieved,

30:57.898 --> 30:59.398
and the swelling's already going down.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.733
Oh, thank God.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.984
Well, what happened?

31:02.110 --> 31:03.861
I mean, did she bang her head
at a meet, or did she...

31:03.987 --> 31:06.030
No, nothing like that.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.657
Then why is she bleeding?

31:07.783 --> 31:09.534
Is she gonna be all right?

31:10.536 --> 31:12.620
I'm sorry. We still don't know.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.605
No toxins,
no tumor, no bone cancer.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.899
Renal failure could cause
the rash, fever, and muscle pain.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.651
Maybe it's some sort of
genetic kidney disorder.

31:43.777 --> 31:44.819
No family history.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.113
And no blood in her urine or uremia.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.489
Not yet.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.242
You want to do a differential
based on symptoms that might happen?

31:51.368 --> 31:52.451
You got a better idea?

31:52.578 --> 31:53.744
Stop it.

31:54.830 --> 31:58.082
Stop looking for things we don't know,
and focus on what we do know.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.502
What do we actually know,
besides what's up there?

32:03.755 --> 32:04.589
Come on.

32:05.007 --> 32:07.008
How hard can it be to tell me
what you already know?

32:07.134 --> 32:08.134
She's 12.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.761
She spends a lot of time in pools,
exposure to chemicals.

32:10.887 --> 32:13.055
- She travels a lot.
- But never out of the country.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.599
What else?

32:15.809 --> 32:17.184
Come on!

32:38.999 --> 32:41.000
We're missing something.

32:41.585 --> 32:42.585
What?

32:42.711 --> 32:45.630
Well, if I knew that,
it wouldn't be missing.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.798
Maybe she's adopted,
and we've got the wrong history.

32:47.924 --> 32:52.470
No. She's got her mom's eyes
and a red patch of hair, just like Dad.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.347
What about
an allergic reaction?

32:54.473 --> 32:56.098
That could explain the rash
and muscle pain,

32:56.224 --> 32:59.101
but probably not the bleeding
or seizures.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.520
That's a lot of balloons.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.564
You think she's allergic to polyester?

33:03.690 --> 33:07.068
Not unless she's been competing
in the nude all these years.

33:07.194 --> 33:11.155
Then what are you thinking?
What do the balloons mean?

33:15.661 --> 33:19.330
What if the rash isn't a rash?

33:19.456 --> 33:20.581
What are you talking about?

33:20.707 --> 33:22.249
Who gave her the balloons?

33:22.376 --> 33:23.626
Some of the girls from her team.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.294
They've been visiting
her pretty regularly,

33:25.420 --> 33:26.462
but none of them are sick.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.588
What about the guys?

33:27.714 --> 33:28.631
None of them are sick, either.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.633
Which guys visited her?

33:32.511 --> 33:33.969
Actually, none.

33:37.391 --> 33:39.642
She's cute. She's nice.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.769
She's a kick-ass diver.

33:42.479 --> 33:43.604
You'd think the guys would be

33:43.730 --> 33:45.564
falling all over themselves
to get close to her.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.108
She's 12.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.734
The youngest guy on her team is 16.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.071
Okay, so maybe they're just
not interested, or...

33:52.197 --> 33:53.989
They're avoiding her.

33:54.741 --> 33:57.702
There any cell fragments
in her blood smears?

33:58.829 --> 34:01.956
No. Red blood cells were intact.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.715
Check them again.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.894
Blood looks like it's been put
through the blender now.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.938
- You done yet?
- You were right.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.356
The rash wasn't a rash.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.608
She's bleeding into her skin.
It's purpura.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.069
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?

34:32.195 --> 34:34.613
Starts with "T." You were so close.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.282
What could have set it off?

34:36.408 --> 34:38.367
She had no traces of
E. coli in her cultures.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.287
She's obviously not menopausal,
so no estrogen.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.914
There is one other possible cause.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.335
Oh, God.

34:56.678 --> 35:00.014
Pregnancy causes all kinds of
chemical and biological changes

35:00.140 --> 35:01.849
in a woman's body,

35:02.934 --> 35:05.728
or a girl's body, as the case may be.

35:09.608 --> 35:14.236
In extremely rare cases, everything
goes haywire. It's called TTP.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.988
Blood starts clotting like crazy

35:16.114 --> 35:19.366
and clogs the vessels
in your brain and kidneys.

35:20.035 --> 35:23.954
Red blood cells end up getting shredded
as they squeeze past the clot,

35:24.080 --> 35:26.624
like a fat guy in a crowded bar.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.628
I'm sure you know what that's like.

35:30.754 --> 35:33.339
I mean, you're only 12,
but you're all grown up, right?

35:33.465 --> 35:37.593
Travel on your own,
hang out in hotel rooms,

35:37.719 --> 35:39.720
getting room service
with your teammates.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.431
Maybe someone sneaks in
a couple of beers.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.099
You start playing spin the bottle.

35:44.226 --> 35:47.144
Next thing you know, you're waking up
with nothing on but your socks.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.063
It wasn't like that.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.272
Of course not.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.149
You wanted it.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.610
Yeah. I did.

35:54.736 --> 35:55.986
He turned out to be a jerk, but...

35:56.112 --> 35:59.490
Actually, under New Jersey law,
the term is "felon."

36:01.076 --> 36:03.160
I knew what I was doing.

36:05.539 --> 36:08.374
We're gonna have to do something
called plasmapheresis.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.835
Cleans the antibodies from your blood.

36:10.961 --> 36:14.213
We're also gonna have to
terminate the pregnancy.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.593
You gonna tell my parents?

36:20.303 --> 36:23.848
Someone should.
Rock, paper, scissors?

36:23.974 --> 36:26.517
They don't need to know.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.269
I'll be all right.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.355
Of course you will.

36:31.481 --> 36:34.400
I mean, if you're old enough to bleed
out of your vagina,

36:34.526 --> 36:36.443
then obviously you're mature enough

36:36.570 --> 36:38.070
to handle a simple thing
like an abortion

36:38.196 --> 36:40.406
without Mommy and Daddy's help.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.745
You gonna tell my parents?

36:50.500 --> 36:54.628
Under New Jersey law,
you're the boss.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.224
Your daughter has TTP.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.060
Don't worry. It's curable.
She'll be fine.

37:10.186 --> 37:13.355
Well, wait. I mean,
what does TTP stand for?

37:14.232 --> 37:17.401
Some really big words
that you've never heard before,

37:17.527 --> 37:19.069
and, when we're done,
will never hear again.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.279
Have a nice day.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.740
Well, when can we take her home?

37:23.825 --> 37:25.618
In a few days.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.287
She needs some minor surgery to
remove the underlying cause

37:28.413 --> 37:30.414
before we can do the...

37:30.540 --> 37:31.957
Another really big word.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.335
What's the underlying cause?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.464
She has an abnormal growth
in her abdomen.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.673
What kind of surgery?

37:39.799 --> 37:41.383
It's...

37:41.509 --> 37:43.928
It's very simple.
We do it here all the time.

37:44.054 --> 37:45.512
Could you be a little more specific?

37:45.639 --> 37:47.139
Actually, no.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.310
I'm sorry.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.629
We're almost done.

38:22.509 --> 38:23.968
Hang in there.

38:31.685 --> 38:33.560
You're doing good.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.480
You feeling okay?

38:36.898 --> 38:38.482
- Yeah.
- You should be.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.192
Your platelets count's up.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.610
How's your neck?

38:44.572 --> 38:47.533
Looks good.
Anything else we can get you?

38:48.368 --> 38:49.618
No, thanks.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.412
Okay.

38:53.623 --> 38:54.748
Yeah.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.462
Can I see my mom and dad?

39:31.661 --> 39:33.287
Plasmapheresis is working.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.788
She's gonna be fine.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.666
I know.

39:51.264 --> 39:52.765
Hi. I've got these.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.452
I can't even tell you
how much I appreciate

40:13.578 --> 40:15.871
the opportunity to meet with you.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.794
The moment I heard
you had another fellowship opening...

40:21.920 --> 40:23.712
There is no opening.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.756
House.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.468
- You have to hire someone.
- I know.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.013
The position's been filled.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.101
Why am I interviewing for a position
that's already been filled?

40:37.227 --> 40:38.560
Exactly.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.691
I called to confirm the interview
this morning.

40:44.818 --> 40:47.402
You figure if you keep arguing
I'm gonna cave,

40:47.529 --> 40:50.114
admit it's all a lie and hire you?

40:56.663 --> 40:59.456
Do you need your parking validated?

41:15.098 --> 41:17.432
I don't want to interview anyone else.

41:17.559 --> 41:19.476
You're interviewing?
I thought you'd just have them

41:19.602 --> 41:22.437
send a head shot along with their CV.

41:23.273 --> 41:24.523
Ha!

41:25.441 --> 41:31.405
That's good, and why I need you around,
to keep me in my place.

41:31.531 --> 41:34.074
I can't come back. I told you that.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.325
Wasn't listening.

41:35.451 --> 41:36.451
Right.

41:37.537 --> 41:41.123
You want me to listen to you more?
I can do that.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.333
Right.

41:43.459 --> 41:46.420
I already accepted a position
somewhere else.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.506
With who?

41:49.632 --> 41:51.341
Yeuell, at Jefferson.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.343
Un-accept it.

41:53.469 --> 41:54.803
Why?

41:57.432 --> 41:59.725
Because Yeuell is boring.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.436
And he's pedantic and preachy.

42:03.438 --> 42:05.147
Because he's short.

42:07.442 --> 42:09.902
Because I want you to come back.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.575
Not good enough.

42:19.996 --> 42:22.623
Want more money?

42:22.749 --> 42:25.542
A car allowance?
A better parking space?

42:29.172 --> 42:30.464
Dinner.

42:33.968 --> 42:37.304
And not just a meal
between two colleagues.

42:37.430 --> 42:38.722
A date.

42:47.649 --> 42:49.816
You'll come back to work

42:50.860 --> 42:53.737
if I go out on a date with you?

42:53.863 --> 42:54.988
Yes.

42:59.786 --> 43:01.453
Okay.

43:03.164 --> 43:04.706
It's a deal.

43:13.675 --> 43:15.676
See you tomorrow morning.

43:17.387 --> 43:18.762
Don't be late.

43:18.888 --> 43:20.264
I won't.
