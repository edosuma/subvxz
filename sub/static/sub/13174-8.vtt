00:01.189 --> 00:02.697
Previously on Wrecked...

00:03.203 --> 00:04.435
Yolonzo! Yolonzo?

00:04.470 --> 00:06.170
- Yolonzo's dead.
- What?

00:07.777 --> 00:08.969
Oh, my God!

00:08.970 --> 00:10.403
We got to keep you out of sight

00:10.439 --> 00:11.671
because if they knew you were down here,

00:11.706 --> 00:13.006
they'd eat you.

00:13.041 --> 00:14.841
You chowed down on a dead dude,

00:14.876 --> 00:16.543
and now he's talking to you.

00:16.578 --> 00:18.445
Maybe it's because you're crazy.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.547
Keep your eyes open. Is the safety off?

00:20.582 --> 00:21.881
Of course, it's off.

00:24.286 --> 00:26.453
Accident or not, Danny shot Pack,

00:26.488 --> 00:27.820
and he deserves to be punished.

00:27.856 --> 00:30.023
Danny, I give you three
weeks in the pit,

00:30.058 --> 00:31.758
and, Owen, you'll be joining him.

00:31.793 --> 00:33.126
We're not gonna go in your pit.

00:33.162 --> 00:35.028
I'm banishing myself and Danny.

00:35.063 --> 00:38.498
Once you leave, you can never return.

Steve, what are you doing here?

01:02.320 --> 01:03.956
You're struggling with your satchel.

01:03.992 --> 01:05.090
That's quite nice, actually.

01:05.126 --> 01:07.561
Hey, hey, Steve.

01:07.596 --> 01:08.961
Steve, take it easy.

01:16.984 --> 01:20.353
ONE WEEK EARLIER

01:20.553 --> 01:22.175
¶ Every day she takes her morning bath ¶

01:22.211 --> 01:24.644
¶ She wets her hair ¶

01:24.680 --> 01:26.112
¶ Wraps a towel around her ¶

01:26.147 --> 01:29.048
¶ As she's heading for
the bedroom chair ¶

01:29.084 --> 01:32.085
¶ It's just another day ¶

01:32.120 --> 01:36.489
¶ Slipping into stockings,
stepping into shoes ¶

01:36.525 --> 01:39.226
¶ Dipping in the pocket
of her raincoat ¶

01:42.564 --> 01:45.965
¶ It's just another day ¶

01:46.000 --> 01:49.936
¶ At the office where the papers
grow, she takes a break ¶

01:49.971 --> 01:51.904
¶ Drinks a mug of coffee ¶

01:51.940 --> 01:54.574
¶ And she finds it hard to stay awake ¶

01:54.610 --> 01:58.545
¶ It's just another day ¶

02:00.249 --> 02:01.981
¶ It's just another day ¶

02:03.252 --> 02:06.586
Steve... we're letting
your department go.

02:07.256 --> 02:08.722
Go where?

02:08.757 --> 02:11.591
We're laying off your whole department.

02:11.627 --> 02:13.159
It's just me and Kevin.

02:13.194 --> 02:16.996
Well, actually, we're moving
Kevin over to finance.

02:24.773 --> 02:26.172
Wait. It's just me?

02:26.207 --> 02:28.908
Steve, this is one of the
hardest rounds of layoff

02:28.943 --> 02:30.143
I've ever had to do.

02:30.178 --> 02:31.745
I've been here 15 years.

02:31.780 --> 02:34.013
All right, you don't have
to be a dick about it.

02:34.048 --> 02:40.354
¶ So sad ¶

02:40.355 --> 02:41.747
¶ Sometimes you feel ¶

02:41.748 --> 02:43.173
Carol!

02:44.025 --> 02:46.626
What are you doing here?

02:46.662 --> 02:49.862
What am I doing here?

02:49.898 --> 02:51.631
Wait. This isn't my house.

02:51.667 --> 02:52.832
You thought this was your house?

02:52.867 --> 02:54.701
I've done it again.

02:54.736 --> 02:56.035
I've come to another person's house.

02:56.070 --> 02:57.604
Eric, you sexy devil,

02:57.639 --> 02:59.706
are you talking to
yourself out there again?

02:59.741 --> 03:01.308
Who is that?

03:01.343 --> 03:03.743
Steve, what are you doing home?

03:03.779 --> 03:06.212
What am I doing? What's he doing?

03:06.247 --> 03:09.616
Eric, you just fired me.
Why would you come here?

03:12.120 --> 03:14.153
Well, I thought you'd go
to a bar or something.

03:19.194 --> 03:20.694
The timing couldn't be worse, mate.

03:20.729 --> 03:22.595
I just renewed my gym membership, and...

03:22.631 --> 03:23.863
Steve.

03:23.898 --> 03:24.964
Steve.

03:24.999 --> 03:25.998
Steve.

03:26.034 --> 03:28.134
- Steve.
- What?

03:28.169 --> 03:29.969
Is this okay for the
rope for the shelter?

03:31.092 --> 03:32.039
Oh, yes.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.272
Thanks, Kurt. That's perfect.

03:42.150 --> 03:44.701
My God, Em, you're burning up.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.622
What do I do?

03:46.623 --> 03:49.389
You have to get me off this island.

03:49.424 --> 03:51.391
Mengshu Fever acts really quickly.

03:51.426 --> 03:54.026
If I don't get the proper medication...

03:54.062 --> 03:56.195
This is all my fault.

03:56.231 --> 03:59.632
That whole stupid girls'
trip was my idea,

03:59.668 --> 04:01.368
and now we're stranded here,

04:01.403 --> 04:04.036
and Menshu Fever.

04:04.072 --> 04:05.972
- Mengshu.
- Menshu?

04:06.007 --> 04:07.306
Mengshu.

04:07.342 --> 04:09.208
- Mengshu.
- Mengshu.

04:09.244 --> 04:10.243
Mengshu.

04:10.278 --> 04:11.878
I can't even do anything.

04:11.913 --> 04:14.881
I just... Tiny bottles of water.

04:14.916 --> 04:16.815
What about Owen's boat?

04:16.851 --> 04:18.651
What about Owen's boat?

04:18.687 --> 04:21.087
We can use it. You just have to fix it.

04:21.122 --> 04:23.656
I'm not the one who fixes things.

04:23.692 --> 04:24.924
It's what you always do.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.159
Well, now I need you.

04:27.195 --> 04:29.195
I've always needed you.

04:30.899 --> 04:33.900
You do it. You just need to find a way.

04:41.109 --> 04:42.909
Well, that was the...

04:42.944 --> 04:45.344
No more peanuts. Yep.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.846
No more peanuts.

04:46.882 --> 04:48.681
I've had too many peanuts today.

04:48.717 --> 04:50.016
I might be allergic to them.

04:50.051 --> 04:51.183
Yeah.

04:53.789 --> 04:57.710
- I'm so hungry, man. I am so hungry.
- My stomach hurts with hunger pains.

04:59.127 --> 05:00.993
I just wish Karen were here.

05:01.029 --> 05:03.763
We'd be up to our assholes
in boar meat right now.

05:03.799 --> 05:05.698
Why don't we go hunting?

05:05.734 --> 05:06.933
Us?

05:06.968 --> 05:08.768
How hard could it be, really?

05:08.804 --> 05:10.303
That's true. Can't be that hard.

05:10.338 --> 05:12.305
- We are men.
- Yeah. Men hunt things.

05:12.340 --> 05:14.941
We created weapons to kill
things for this reason.

05:14.976 --> 05:17.844
We're the most dominant
species on the planet.

05:17.879 --> 05:19.145
Top of the food chain.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.681
We took a killer whale out of the ocean

05:21.716 --> 05:23.249
and put it in a fish tank.

05:23.284 --> 05:24.350
How do we even do that?

05:24.385 --> 05:26.419
We wear other animals as hats.

05:26.455 --> 05:29.155
Sheep aren't walking around
wearing manskin coats.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.990
- Fuck sheep!
- Yeah. Fuck sheep!

05:31.025 --> 05:32.926
- We're gonna kill boars!
- Let's go kill boars right now!

05:32.961 --> 05:35.094
Oh, my God. I just got scared.

05:35.129 --> 05:37.029
- For the boars!
- Yeah!

05:49.344 --> 05:52.378
Pack, look at you.

05:52.413 --> 05:54.013
Pretending to be nice,

05:54.048 --> 05:57.851
like you're not a friggin'
animal who ate a dude.

05:57.886 --> 06:01.253
Yeah, well, you're dead,
so who's gonna know?

06:01.289 --> 06:02.421
Pack!

06:02.457 --> 06:04.123
You were saying?

06:06.260 --> 06:07.727
I've been looking for you.

06:07.762 --> 06:08.995
Hey.

06:09.030 --> 06:11.965
Karen found something in the jungle.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.432
Something I think we need to talk about.

06:13.468 --> 06:16.369
You're screwed, dude.

06:16.404 --> 06:19.271
Steve, I was starving out there.

06:19.307 --> 06:22.274
He was already dead. I'm
not a cannibal, I swear!

06:23.116 --> 06:24.243
- What?
- What?

06:24.278 --> 06:25.311
What?

06:25.346 --> 06:27.380
What?

06:27.415 --> 06:29.348
W-What?

06:29.384 --> 06:31.518
What?

06:31.553 --> 06:34.954
Karen found your Xanax in the jungle.

06:34.990 --> 06:37.156
I was gonna suggest we ration them out.

06:37.191 --> 06:38.958
Yeah, that's a good idea.

06:38.994 --> 06:41.928
What were you talking about there?

06:41.963 --> 06:44.263
Did you eat someone out there?

06:45.901 --> 06:47.233
I was just trying to survive.

06:49.037 --> 06:51.905
Oh, God!

06:51.940 --> 06:54.073
All right.

06:56.477 --> 06:59.445
Pack, no one can ever know about this.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.949
They'll think you're a monster!

07:02.984 --> 07:04.951
You have to promise not to tell anyone.

07:04.986 --> 07:07.319
Please!

07:07.355 --> 07:08.955
I will.

07:08.990 --> 07:12.191
But if I do, I need to know
that I can trust you, too.

07:19.094 --> 07:20.860
It's finally here.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.745
My last day in the pit.

07:24.753 --> 07:26.185
You know what that
means, don't you, buddy?

07:26.221 --> 07:28.187
Time to get you out of here.

07:28.223 --> 07:30.256
Don't start. You know
what they would do if...

07:31.325 --> 07:34.160
I have no choice, all right?

07:36.131 --> 07:37.263
Come here.

07:37.298 --> 07:39.232
I know, I know.

07:39.267 --> 07:41.768
Remember the plan. Just
remember the plan, buddy.

07:41.803 --> 07:44.336
Once you get topside, you
take off for that jungle,

07:44.372 --> 07:46.005
and you don't look back.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.175
...I know. I won't be there.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.343
I won't be there. I know...

07:54.468 --> 07:57.183
Be good now. You hear?

07:58.113 --> 07:59.451
Ready?

07:59.487 --> 08:01.254
No, Meat, here we go.

08:01.289 --> 08:04.290
One, two...

08:10.257 --> 08:11.697
...No!

08:12.178 --> 08:13.218
What the hell is this?!

08:13.219 --> 08:14.433
Karen. Oh, God.

08:14.468 --> 08:16.235
Did you just throw a boar at me?

08:16.271 --> 08:17.270
Look, look, look.

08:17.305 --> 08:18.737
He's my little guy,

08:18.773 --> 08:20.239
and he's just going to the jungle

08:20.275 --> 08:21.774
where he belongs, all right?

08:21.810 --> 08:23.709
So just let him go to the jungle, okay?

08:23.744 --> 08:26.946
Just do the right thing,
Karen, please, please.

08:26.981 --> 08:28.014
Oh, I will.

08:29.236 --> 08:30.482
Oh, Karen.

08:30.518 --> 08:32.217
I love you!

08:32.253 --> 08:33.485
I hate you!

08:33.520 --> 08:35.788
He's been hoarding live contraband

08:35.823 --> 08:37.155
down there the whole time.

08:37.192 --> 08:38.756
His name's Meat.

08:38.793 --> 08:39.991
You know, I'm just disappointed, Todd.

08:40.028 --> 08:42.094
We were gonna let you out today,

08:42.130 --> 08:44.396
but after this... pit extension.

08:44.432 --> 08:46.398
If you touch one hair on his chin,

08:46.434 --> 08:49.135
I will split your tiny nuts...

08:49.170 --> 08:50.402
Relax, Todd.

08:50.438 --> 08:52.905
Nothing's gonna happen with the boar.

08:52.941 --> 08:54.406
Not until we've fattened him up.

08:54.442 --> 08:56.542
...No, no, no, Steve!

08:56.577 --> 08:58.344
Steve! Meat!

08:58.379 --> 09:01.881
No! No!

09:06.254 --> 09:07.887
This should work.

09:10.058 --> 09:11.157
It has to.

09:11.192 --> 09:12.758
So, you've built a raft?

09:12.793 --> 09:15.161
Emma and I are gonna sail
it to find some help.

09:15.196 --> 09:16.896
I don't know, Flo. Emma's really sick.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.965
If she doesn't see a doctor
soon, she's gonna die.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.068
The two of you out on the
ocean? You'll get lost.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.336
You'll both die.

09:23.371 --> 09:25.338
It's a risk we have to take.

09:25.373 --> 09:28.374
So, all I need from you
is just some food,

09:28.409 --> 09:30.910
water, just a few supplies.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.545
I can't do it. We have low supplies.

09:33.581 --> 09:36.249
I can't devote what little we
have to a suicide mission.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.917
Steve, are you listening?

09:37.952 --> 09:39.886
It's now or never for Emma.

09:39.921 --> 09:41.587
Well, then, it's never.

09:42.799 --> 09:43.956
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

09:43.992 --> 09:46.092
I just... I have to look out
for the island, all right?

09:46.127 --> 09:49.628
What's best for the island.
You understand.

09:54.402 --> 09:57.904
This feels like a place that a boar
would like to hang out in, right?

09:57.939 --> 09:59.171
Yeah, totally.

09:59.207 --> 10:02.008
And when it comes...

10:02.043 --> 10:04.662
- Down goes the perp.
- The perp?

10:04.663 --> 10:05.912
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:05.947 --> 10:08.147
You never really had any sort
of police training, right?

10:08.182 --> 10:11.918
Oh, no, no, but I know enough
basic cop tricks to get by.

10:11.953 --> 10:14.086
Cop tricks? What cop tricks?

10:14.122 --> 10:15.955
You know, standard police officer stuff.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.292
Keep a round in the chamber,
always shoot your hostage.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.393
Always shoot your hostage?

10:20.428 --> 10:22.628
Always shoot the hostage.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.898
Okay, say a bad guy has a lady hostage.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.666
You can't get a clean shot
'cause she's in the way.

10:27.701 --> 10:29.568
You put one in her leg...

10:29.603 --> 10:31.971
she goes down, he's all yours.

10:34.309 --> 10:36.142
That is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.643
What if you kill the hostage?

10:37.678 --> 10:39.611
Sometimes you gotta roll the dice.

10:54.262 --> 10:56.728
How long is gonna go on for?

11:01.102 --> 11:03.202
No, I don't want to be part of the...

11:03.237 --> 11:04.503
Okay.

11:07.073 --> 11:08.075
Well, I'm glad that that's...

11:08.076 --> 11:08.975
Okay.

11:09.010 --> 11:10.309
Second gun.

11:13.614 --> 11:16.048
In your mind, is this like a six shooter

11:16.084 --> 11:17.984
or like an actual police gun?

11:18.019 --> 11:19.485
.45.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.087
Hey...

11:21.122 --> 11:22.455
What, what? What is that?

11:22.490 --> 11:23.489
- What is that noise?
- What is that?

11:23.524 --> 11:25.157
What is that?

11:25.193 --> 11:26.625
What is that?

11:26.660 --> 11:28.660
- What is that sound?
- Do you hear something?

11:28.696 --> 11:30.698
- Was that something?
- It's coming this way.

11:30.699 --> 11:32.303
What is that? What is that?

11:34.399 --> 11:35.634
Oh, my God! It's a boar!

11:36.770 --> 11:38.637
They're everywhere!
They've surrounded us!

11:38.672 --> 11:40.172
Be faster, go!

11:40.208 --> 11:41.207
I can't run faster!

11:41.242 --> 11:42.308
Then let me pass you!

11:42.343 --> 11:43.577
Oh, no!

11:46.514 --> 11:48.314
Hey, Kurt.

11:48.349 --> 11:51.732
You guarding all the supplies
from the island thieves?

11:51.733 --> 11:54.020
Yeah, Steve asked me to.

11:54.055 --> 11:55.354
I don't really get why.

11:55.390 --> 11:57.223
Cool.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.258
Man...

11:59.293 --> 12:01.260
do you ever get so horny?

12:03.664 --> 12:06.032
Yeah.

12:06.067 --> 12:08.100
Sure. I mean, sometimes.

12:08.136 --> 12:09.135
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:09.170 --> 12:11.270
You don't happen to know

12:11.305 --> 12:13.472
where we can find a condom, do you?

12:14.702 --> 12:16.608
I could find one.

12:16.644 --> 12:18.444
I could get one right now.

12:18.479 --> 12:20.612
How about you go do that?

12:20.648 --> 12:22.348
I'll guard the stuff.

12:22.383 --> 12:24.016
I'll be right back.

12:24.052 --> 12:26.285
Holy shit.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.354
Yes, bitch!

12:44.172 --> 12:46.105
People of the island!

12:46.140 --> 12:47.739
It pains me to have to do this,

12:47.775 --> 12:52.144
but Florence, unfortunately, has
been caught stealing supplies.

12:53.177 --> 12:53.916
Yeah.

12:53.917 --> 12:56.348
I'm trying to save Emma,
and he won't let me.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.251
Florence, even if that were true,

12:59.287 --> 13:00.819
you could have come and seen me.

13:00.854 --> 13:04.256
I... I would have been happy
to help you out there, okay?

13:04.292 --> 13:06.792
I mean, it's a shame you
didn't. It's a shame.

13:07.331 --> 13:08.660
You're insane.

13:08.696 --> 13:11.297
He's totally insane. I
went to go see him.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.432
No, she didn't. All right, lower her in.

13:13.468 --> 13:15.334
You have to believe me,
I went to go see him.

13:15.369 --> 13:16.735
Down you go! Shush!

13:16.770 --> 13:19.037
You only like him 'cause
he's got a stupid accent!

13:19.073 --> 13:20.672
Keep quiet as you're going down there.

13:20.708 --> 13:23.509
He's wearing a hat at night
like a freakin' weirdo!

13:23.544 --> 13:25.311
Don't talk as you're being lowered.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.412
Down you go!

13:28.082 --> 13:30.048
That's the way, just accept it.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.285
Well, well, well.

13:33.321 --> 13:35.254
Look what the sex swing lowered in.

13:35.289 --> 13:37.523
Todd, Steve's gone insane.

13:37.558 --> 13:40.493
I know. He took my Meat.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.328
We have to get out of here.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.196
Todd's listening.

13:44.232 --> 13:46.232
Okay, the raft is right here.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.667
All of the supplies we need are here.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.369
If you can grab the supplies,

13:50.404 --> 13:52.505
I can meet you with Emma and
the raft down by the water,

13:52.540 --> 13:54.106
and then we're out.

13:54.142 --> 13:56.575
Just one problem...
we're stuck in the pit.

13:56.611 --> 13:58.277
No one's ever escaped the pit.

13:58.312 --> 14:00.179
Then we're gonna have to be the first.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.714
Hey, guys. I'm standing right here.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.683
Okay, I can hear everything
that you're saying.

14:04.718 --> 14:08.454
Your stupid plan, so just
shut up and go to bed!

14:15.129 --> 14:16.595
New plan.

14:16.631 --> 14:19.765
We wait till he falls asleep,
or there's a guard change.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.867
You boost me out of here, okay?

14:21.902 --> 14:23.302
And then I can snap...

14:23.337 --> 14:24.436
Guys!

14:24.472 --> 14:25.771
Everything you're saying

14:25.806 --> 14:28.174
is literally being amplified by the pit.

14:28.209 --> 14:31.109
It's like you're screaming
your bullshit into my ear.

14:31.145 --> 14:33.212
And by the way, there is no guard...

14:41.053 --> 14:43.153
All right, here you go.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.644
And you're out. There we go.

14:48.078 --> 14:49.008
Hi.

14:49.009 --> 14:51.366
Did you really think I was gonna let
you rot in the pit your whole life?

14:51.367 --> 14:53.434
- Come here.
- What?

14:54.117 --> 14:57.305
God, I have waited so long to do that.

14:58.210 --> 14:59.941
Look, we gotta get out of here.
I heard the whole plan.

14:59.977 --> 15:01.610
I mean, that pit is
basically a megaphone.

15:01.645 --> 15:03.244
Come on.

15:03.279 --> 15:06.347
I'm sorry. Who are you?

15:06.382 --> 15:07.716
Who am I?

15:07.751 --> 15:09.618
Corey.

15:09.653 --> 15:12.420
It's me... Corey. Do
you not know who I am?

15:12.455 --> 15:14.422
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Corey!

15:14.457 --> 15:15.924
It's me... Corey.

15:15.959 --> 15:18.292
I've literally been on the
island the entire time.

15:18.328 --> 15:19.861
I mean, my God, Florence.

15:19.896 --> 15:22.296
I kind of thought you and I had

15:22.332 --> 15:24.866
sort of an unspoken connection, right?

15:28.347 --> 15:29.504
Don't come in, Harry.

15:31.775 --> 15:33.508
My vote is for...

15:35.892 --> 15:37.345
Florence!

15:37.380 --> 15:39.513
What? Obviously.

15:39.745 --> 15:41.315
Hey, you!

15:41.351 --> 15:43.752
Water's great today!

15:44.435 --> 15:46.054
Cool!

15:46.089 --> 15:48.356
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

15:48.391 --> 15:51.359
This is unbelievable right now.
Are you kidding me?

15:51.394 --> 15:52.961
It's like there's 10 of you

15:52.996 --> 15:55.697
that think the entire island
just revolves around you.

15:55.732 --> 15:57.632
I mean, my God, what am I? What are we?

15:57.668 --> 16:00.969
Just background actors in the
story of your freakin' lives?

16:01.004 --> 16:02.937
I can't believe I left Beth for you.

16:02.973 --> 16:05.367
- Who?
- What? Who?

16:05.368 --> 16:06.507
- Beth.
- Beth?

16:06.543 --> 16:07.776
You don't know Beth?

16:07.811 --> 16:09.811
She crashed here with
her brother, Lamar.

16:09.846 --> 16:11.846
Beth and Lamar?

16:11.882 --> 16:14.382
They found that secret
cove a couple weeks ago.

16:14.417 --> 16:15.750
It had all those maps in it.

16:15.786 --> 16:17.451
Could be the key out of here.

16:17.487 --> 16:19.287
It's all anyone was talking
about the whole time.

16:19.322 --> 16:20.588
Are you serious?

16:20.623 --> 16:22.057
They could have lost
their freakin' lives!

16:22.092 --> 16:23.992
- I mean, Jesus Christ!
- All right!

16:24.027 --> 16:25.794
Do you think about anyone
other than yourselves?!

16:25.829 --> 16:27.528
Just keep your voice down, Lamar!

16:27.564 --> 16:29.363
- I'm not Lamar!
- Right.

16:29.399 --> 16:30.832
It's Beth and Lamar.

16:30.867 --> 16:33.467
I'm Corey. This is outrageous right now.

16:33.503 --> 16:36.771
I came over here to stick my
neck out to save the two of you.

16:36.807 --> 16:38.372
I don't even know why I did that.

16:38.408 --> 16:39.874
In fact, right now, I'm
gonna go get Steve,

16:39.910 --> 16:41.743
maybe give him the heads-up
on the big escape pl...

16:44.547 --> 16:45.947
I'm back in 100%.

16:45.982 --> 16:47.849
- Sorry I lost my cool.
- Okay.

16:47.884 --> 16:50.651
So, Todd, you have to go
get those supplies, okay?

16:50.687 --> 16:52.087
And then we are gonna go get the raft...

16:52.122 --> 16:53.621
Change of plans, hombres.

16:53.656 --> 16:54.989
I gotta go take care of something.

16:55.025 --> 16:57.558
What? Todd! What about the plan?

16:57.594 --> 16:59.094
Oh, you son of a bitch.

16:59.129 --> 17:00.773
Let him go. We gotta get out of here.

17:00.799 --> 17:01.572
Oh, Christ...

17:05.902 --> 17:07.635
God damn it!

17:09.539 --> 17:12.506
Let's just go back. We're
starving out here.

17:12.541 --> 17:13.875
At least back there, we'll be fed.

17:13.910 --> 17:16.410
Danny, I said no.

17:16.445 --> 17:18.946
If this is about you protecting
me from the pit, it's okay.

17:18.982 --> 17:20.548
Dude, it's not.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.105
Seriously. I don't mind.
I'll go back and do my time.

17:23.106 --> 17:23.818
You don't have to worry about...

17:23.854 --> 17:26.619
Danny, I don't care
about you in the pit.

17:31.328 --> 17:33.594
I mean, do you not realize that Steve

17:33.630 --> 17:36.131
has got everybody here brainwashed?

17:36.166 --> 17:39.533
They want to stay here forever,
and if we go back now,

17:39.569 --> 17:41.936
then Steve wins and we're stuck here.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.641
So, the trial, that was never about me.

17:46.676 --> 17:49.610
That was about you
getting back at Steve.

17:49.646 --> 17:51.846
I don't know. Yes, sure.

17:53.716 --> 17:55.984
So, this is what you do?

17:56.019 --> 17:58.619
Flight attendant going from city
to city, never letting anybody in.

17:58.655 --> 17:59.888
What are you doing? What is this?

17:59.923 --> 18:02.523
Now I know why you want to leave so bad.

18:02.558 --> 18:05.493
If you're stuck here, somebody
might actually get to know you.

18:05.528 --> 18:07.628
Danny, get away from me.

18:07.664 --> 18:08.997
I'm not gonna leave you.
You're my friend.

18:09.032 --> 18:10.665
Dude, I am not your friend!

18:10.700 --> 18:12.733
We are just stuck here together!

18:16.639 --> 18:18.006
Okay.

18:33.223 --> 18:34.588
Okay, you get her feet,
I'll get the head.

18:34.624 --> 18:35.756
You said you'd get the feet.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.010
I want her head.

18:37.227 --> 18:38.759
One, two, three.

18:38.795 --> 18:40.461
Who the hell are you?

18:40.496 --> 18:42.864
What? Corey. It's me... Corey.

18:42.899 --> 18:44.765
- How does no one remember?
- You know Corey.

18:44.801 --> 18:46.667
She loves... She loves you, Corey.

18:46.703 --> 18:48.970
- She never... She never stops
talking about you. - No.

18:49.005 --> 18:50.972
- She's always, like,
"Corey's the best." - Who?

18:51.007 --> 18:53.474
Meat, Meat! Oh, God.

18:53.509 --> 18:55.543
Oh, God. Hey, hey, buddy.

18:55.578 --> 18:58.079
I know, I know. I told you
I'd come back for you.

18:58.114 --> 19:00.581
I told you I'd come back
for you, and I did.

19:00.616 --> 19:01.850
...I know you can be mad,

19:01.885 --> 19:04.118
but listen, listen, bro, okay?

19:04.154 --> 19:06.120
You got to go.

19:06.156 --> 19:08.022
No, you gotta go.

19:08.058 --> 19:10.024
There's freaks here, and
they want to eat you,

19:10.060 --> 19:12.060
and you gotta go to the
other side of the island

19:12.095 --> 19:13.794
where the other boars are, all right?

19:16.532 --> 19:17.531
Don't you dare!

19:17.567 --> 19:19.533
Don't you dare do that to me, Meat.

19:19.569 --> 19:22.436
I love you so much, but you
can't stay, all right?

19:22.472 --> 19:25.539
You can't do that. All
right, you got to go.

19:25.575 --> 19:28.109
All right, buddy.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.945
Yeah, shag ass, stud!

19:32.151 --> 19:34.349
You're like the wind, man!

19:36.186 --> 19:40.688
They can't hurt you anymore,
Meat. You're gone.

19:40.723 --> 19:43.157
You're gone.

19:51.210 --> 19:53.010
Wait. Who's that?

19:53.045 --> 19:54.879
Todd, I thought you bailed.

19:54.914 --> 19:56.914
No, but they're right behind me.

19:56.949 --> 19:58.749
Karen saw me stealing the supplies.

19:58.785 --> 20:00.518
You guys push off. I'll hold them back.

20:00.553 --> 20:03.086
No, wait! You're staying here?

20:04.216 --> 20:06.557
If that pig taught me anything,

20:06.592 --> 20:08.859
it's that you gotta fight
for the ones you love.

20:08.895 --> 20:10.260
I can't leave Jess behind.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.798
Wow! Even after Chet?

20:13.833 --> 20:14.965
What's that you say?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.869
Yeah, Jess and Chet are banging.

20:18.905 --> 20:22.005
All right it, fuck it. Let's go.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.341
Look, they're getting away! God damn it!

20:24.376 --> 20:26.076
Someone's got to stay
back and hold them off.

20:26.111 --> 20:27.812
I want you to paddle,

20:27.847 --> 20:30.681
and I don't want you to
ever look back, okay?

20:30.716 --> 20:33.350
Oh, God, I'll find you
in this life or the next

20:33.385 --> 20:34.384
because I swear...

20:34.385 --> 20:36.019
Harry, hurry the fuck up!

20:36.055 --> 20:38.288
Yep, you got it, okay. Here we go.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.257
Goodbye, my love!

20:40.292 --> 20:41.926
- Bye.
- Goodbye!

20:42.249 --> 20:43.808
What do we on that, Steve?

20:44.008 --> 20:46.396
Stay back! Everybody back!

20:46.432 --> 20:49.120
Get back! Get back!

20:49.121 --> 20:50.316
Give it! Give it!

21:02.256 --> 21:03.146
Cool gun.

21:03.182 --> 21:04.915
Where'd you get it?

21:10.556 --> 21:14.057
Can you maybe not tell Carol about this?

21:14.093 --> 21:16.794
Yeah, I'm probably gonna tell her.

21:16.829 --> 21:20.698
It's just, it'd feel
weird not telling her.

21:20.733 --> 21:22.833
Hey, you know what you need?

21:22.869 --> 21:24.835
A fresh start.

21:24.871 --> 21:28.906
Yeah, you need to go someplace
far away where nobody knows you.

21:28.941 --> 21:31.942
Someplace you can start
again, be a new man.

21:43.155 --> 21:44.688
Holy shit!

21:44.724 --> 21:45.856
Oh, my God!

21:45.892 --> 21:48.025
That son of a bitch shot me!

21:54.834 --> 21:58.235
No one else leaves my island!

21:58.270 --> 21:59.970
Do you hear me?!

22:00.006 --> 22:02.006
No one!

22:13.305 --> 22:19.851
