00:06.473 --> 00:10.558
Ybor City in the early 1900s was the
Southern version of the Wild West.

00:10.559 --> 00:12.503
And it was violent.

00:12.504 --> 00:15.925
Immediately, like, I feel,
like, a murder/suicide.

00:15.926 --> 00:19.214
You could see right through her.
She had no color. It was a ghost.

00:19.215 --> 00:22.198
Some things are very difficult
to accept and believe.

00:22.199 --> 00:25.034
There were different things
done in different rooms.

00:25.035 --> 00:27.130
Would you be surprised
if tomorrow you found

00:27.131 --> 00:29.323
out there were bodies in his basement?

00:29.324 --> 00:31.090
No.

00:31.091 --> 00:34.670
A lot of dead people are here.

00:34.671 --> 00:37.480
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.481 --> 00:39.548
There's something down there.

00:39.549 --> 00:40.984
I see dead people...

00:40.985 --> 00:42.916
He doesn't want me back there.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.168
I speak to dead people...

00:45.169 --> 00:46.481
She's pissed.

00:46.482 --> 00:47.808
And they speak to me.

00:47.809 --> 00:50.181
She doesn't like the people who live here.

00:50.182 --> 00:53.166
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:53.167 --> 00:54.905
Someone did hang themselves here.

00:54.906 --> 00:56.677
- Where?
- There.

00:56.678 --> 00:58.521
I rely on my partner.

00:58.522 --> 01:01.964
I'm Steve Dischiavi I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:01.965 --> 01:03.424
Did you want to kill him?

01:03.425 --> 01:07.056
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.057 --> 01:08.804
She did die in this house.

01:08.805 --> 01:10.170
It's my job to reveal them.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.540
Would you be surprised if there
were bodies in his basement?

01:12.541 --> 01:13.344
No.

01:13.345 --> 01:15.078
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.079 --> 01:17.013
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.014 --> 01:18.515
Until the very end.

01:18.516 --> 01:19.828
Not good.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.918
Will we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.919 --> 01:22.906
Will it get worse?

01:22.907 --> 01:24.287
Or time to get out?

01:24.288 --> 01:26.208
- Oh, yes.
- Whew.

01:26.209 --> 01:29.269

01:48.512 --> 01:51.081
(Amy) Steve will conduct his investigation,

01:51.082 --> 01:54.772
without knowing anything
that I've encountered.

01:54.773 --> 01:57.873
He interviews the witnesses.

01:57.874 --> 02:00.836
He gathers the facts.

02:00.837 --> 02:03.778
He finds out the history.

02:03.779 --> 02:09.679
And at the end, we'll come
together to compare our findings.

02:11.548 --> 02:17.222
(Steve) I'm in Tampa, Florida, in the
historic district of Ybor, City.

02:17.223 --> 02:23.123
Ybor City was the cigar capital
of the world about 100 years ago.

02:23.475 --> 02:27.982
I'm investigating a hotel
called the Don Vicente Inn.

02:27.983 --> 02:30.756
The owner Tessa called me
because she encountered,

02:30.757 --> 02:33.132
a female apparition in
the basement of the inn.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.870
She didn't really know what to make of it,

02:34.871 --> 02:38.938
until guests started reporting similar
sightings all over the hotel.

02:38.939 --> 02:44.778
Now I'm gonna go meet with her now and
see if I can get to the bottom of it.

02:44.779 --> 02:47.779
(Eerie music playing)

02:57.791 --> 03:01.107
(Amy) Matt will go in before me.

03:01.108 --> 03:03.738
And he'll remove any information,

03:03.739 --> 03:09.139
that may distract me from
communicating with the dead.

03:14.174 --> 03:20.074
And then I come in not knowing anything
and do my walk through the location.

03:20.113 --> 03:23.113
(Eerie music playing)

03:35.867 --> 03:41.248
This is a dead guy here, and
he's a nasty, nasty guy.

03:41.249 --> 03:44.129
(Chuckles nervously)

03:44.717 --> 03:48.007
A lot of dead people are here.

03:48.008 --> 03:53.168
There's a lot of people
coming out of the walls.

04:08.109 --> 04:09.452
(Steve) Tessa.

04:09.453 --> 04:11.062
- Steve, nice to meet you.
- How are you?

04:11.063 --> 04:12.129
Thank you for coming.

04:12.130 --> 04:14.170
Thanks for having me.
This place is beautiful.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.337
Thank you.

04:15.338 --> 04:20.009
Now that I'm here, we spoke on the
phone about things going on here.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.873
Maybe you could explain a little bit about
what's happening and, uh, what you do here.

04:23.874 --> 04:27.553
My dad bought the building in 1998.
It was completely condemned.

04:27.554 --> 04:30.143
Um, it took us about two years to restore.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.840
We have now 16 guest rooms.

04:31.841 --> 04:35.576
We've got 14 on the third floor,
2 on the main floor here.

04:35.577 --> 04:39.897
And we also have a basement downstairs.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.565
Now was this always a hotel?

04:43.566 --> 04:46.087
It wasn't always a hotel, actually.
It was...

04:46.088 --> 04:49.915
Vicente Ybor, who founded Ybor City,
built it as a development corporation.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.729
And then it became a
hospital for some time.

04:52.730 --> 04:54.566
Oh, so this was a hospital at one point.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.681
- Yep.
- And how long has it been a hotel?

04:56.682 --> 04:58.713
It's been a hotel for the past 11 years.

04:58.714 --> 05:00.592
Okay, and you run/own it?

05:00.593 --> 05:04.878
My brother and I run and own it, my dad
restored it, and he comes and goes.

05:04.879 --> 05:06.781
So when we spoke on the phone earlier

05:06.782 --> 05:09.172
you mentioned that you guys are
kind of uncomfortable about

05:09.173 --> 05:11.596
certain things maybe you could
explain some of that for me.

05:11.597 --> 05:13.838
We're kind of concerned about
some of the energy here.

05:13.839 --> 05:17.087
Well, when you say the energy, are you
talking about, like, a negative energy...

05:17.088 --> 05:18.948
Yes.

05:20.492 --> 05:26.392
I've experienced some things. Um, our
guests have experienced some things.

05:27.340 --> 05:33.240
So we kind of want to know who
we're sharing our space with here.

05:36.233 --> 05:39.844
Tessa seems genuinely concerned about
her hotel, and I want to help.

05:39.845 --> 05:41.961
But her description of
this negative energy,

05:41.962 --> 05:46.222
really doesn't give me a strong lead.

05:49.883 --> 05:50.937
(Laughter echoing)

05:50.938 --> 05:54.206
There's, like, this little lady.

05:54.207 --> 05:55.245
(Exhales sharply)

05:55.246 --> 05:57.344
She's taking care of people.

05:57.345 --> 06:01.944
She's doing a lot of stuff
and taking care of people.

06:01.945 --> 06:05.029
And she's, like, doing
it all the time, 24/7.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.145
Back and forth, back and
forth, back and forth.

06:07.146 --> 06:13.046
And she's wearing, like, the, you know,
nurse-y shoes, like, the white shoes.

06:20.022 --> 06:23.036
- So where are we headed now?
- We are headed to our basement.

06:23.037 --> 06:24.905
I am terrified to be down here.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.690
So whenever I am down here by myself,

06:26.691 --> 06:29.643
I take these steps in two
steps going back up.

06:29.644 --> 06:32.384
When we bought it, it was a
little creepy crawl space.

06:32.385 --> 06:38.285
My dad kind of dug it out, and now
we do a lot of parties down here.

06:38.587 --> 06:40.469
So it was 2:30 on a Tuesday afternoon.

06:40.470 --> 06:44.303
I came downstairs, I had my purse on my
shoulder, said good-bye to my brother.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.412
And walked over here to
the women's bathroom,

06:46.413 --> 06:51.874
and that's when the most frightening thing
that's ever happened to me happened.

06:51.875 --> 06:57.775
I walked into the bathroom, turned on the
lights, and there it was, right there.

06:58.139 --> 07:00.809
- What was?
- Well, it was a ghost.

07:00.810 --> 07:03.701
And, um, for several days,
I couldn't figure out

07:03.702 --> 07:06.280
what I really saw until
I had thought about it.

07:06.281 --> 07:08.315
And I know that it was a Spanish woman.

07:08.316 --> 07:10.652
Was she older, younger? Do you remember?

07:10.653 --> 07:13.287
You know, I really... I was
so terrified that I don't...

07:13.288 --> 07:15.417
I don't remember whether
she was old or young.

07:15.418 --> 07:17.551
But you could see right through
her, she had no color.

07:17.552 --> 07:19.762
That had to scare the hell
out of you, I would assume.

07:19.763 --> 07:23.236
I went flying backwards, screaming.
My purse fell off my shoulder.

07:23.237 --> 07:27.240
All the contents ended up on the
basement floor. I was terrified.

07:27.241 --> 07:30.241
(Eerie music playing)

07:31.080 --> 07:33.600
(Door squeaks)

07:38.224 --> 07:41.665
She walks up and down, up
and down, up and down,

07:41.666 --> 07:44.223
up and down, up and down,
up and down, up and down.

07:44.224 --> 07:46.719
A lot on here, up, back,
forth, back, forth,

07:46.720 --> 07:49.671
back and forth, back and forth,
back and forth, back and forth.

07:49.672 --> 07:52.741
But you know what's weird is that, um...

07:52.742 --> 07:55.975
You know, like she... I'm
getting two ages on her.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.782
So I see her, like...

07:58.783 --> 08:00.882
So maybe that's how, like...

08:00.883 --> 08:03.117
How long she was doing this or something?

08:03.118 --> 08:07.318
And she's short. She's really short.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.399
(Steve) So Tessa's seen a Spanish woman,

08:14.400 --> 08:17.428
but she can't give me any specifics
on the experience that she had.

08:17.429 --> 08:18.940
(Door squeaks)

08:18.941 --> 08:21.800
That doesn't help me in a hotel
that used to be a clinic.

08:21.801 --> 08:27.698
Where there would've been hundreds,
if not thousands, of deaths.

08:27.699 --> 08:30.356
Unfortunately, I can't speak to
guests that have come and gone.

08:30.357 --> 08:32.357
But I can speak to Tessa's father.

08:32.359 --> 08:36.499
He may know something Tessa doesn't.

08:42.024 --> 08:43.745
(Steve) So I was talking to your daughter,

08:43.746 --> 08:46.203
and she was saying some interesting
things are happening here.

08:46.204 --> 08:49.703
I'm curious as to you and...

08:49.704 --> 08:54.305
What you might have experienced
here, if anything.

08:54.306 --> 08:58.806
The most significant thing that occurred...

09:00.215 --> 09:02.727
Difficult to talk about things like that.

09:02.728 --> 09:06.868
It sounds so fantastical, so bizarre.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.540
(Indistinct whispering)

09:14.402 --> 09:17.502
(Steve) So I met with Tessa
who owns and runs this hotel,

09:17.503 --> 09:20.237
and she explained her concerns to me.

09:20.238 --> 09:22.327
But I want to talk to her father Jack.

09:22.328 --> 09:27.022
Jack renovated this place, and I'm
sure he knows a lot about its history.

09:27.023 --> 09:28.900
Now, I was talking to
your daughter and she was

09:28.901 --> 09:31.272
saying some interesting
things are happening here.

09:31.273 --> 09:34.702
I'm curious as to you and...

09:34.703 --> 09:37.935
What you might have experienced
here, if anything.

09:37.936 --> 09:41.716
One day, when we were
excavating the basement,

09:41.717 --> 09:45.720
I was sitting down there,
I had my notes, I saw...

09:45.721 --> 09:48.971
Well, it's the basement.
There's no windows there.

09:48.972 --> 09:54.383
But I was sitting there, and I noticed a
light, some brightness over in the corner.

09:54.384 --> 09:57.744
I saw a very small lady.

09:58.501 --> 10:00.528
Latin, definitely...

10:00.529 --> 10:03.589
But very, very small.

10:03.689 --> 10:09.428
And I looked at her, and she just
was there looking back at me.

10:09.429 --> 10:15.329
I was so surprised by the whole thing that
it didn't register, I mean, you know?

10:16.240 --> 10:19.443
Some things are very difficult
to accept and believe.

10:19.444 --> 10:22.011
(Steve) So Jack and his daughter
both have seen a Spanish woman.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.013
I can't be sure that they've
seen the same woman,

10:24.014 --> 10:25.715
but it's definitely an odd coincidence.

10:25.716 --> 10:28.366
Am I the first person to
hear you tell the story?

10:28.367 --> 10:30.947
- Yes.
- Okay.

10:44.242 --> 10:47.302
(Amy) The third floor is
difficult to understand.

10:47.303 --> 10:52.176
I'm being pulled in so many different
directions and to so many different rooms.

10:52.177 --> 10:55.641
Fortunately, the room with the
strongest pull is vacant.

10:55.642 --> 11:00.023
- Can I go? I don't know.
- You can go in there.

11:00.024 --> 11:00.838
(Sighs)

11:00.839 --> 11:02.184
I don't know what this is.

11:02.185 --> 11:07.345
Uh, there's, like, somebody
laying in the hallway.

11:10.193 --> 11:12.194
How are they laying?

11:12.195 --> 11:15.435
Face up. It's a woman.

11:19.001 --> 11:24.901
So I guess I'll go in here and touch
that, see what's up with that.

11:27.043 --> 11:28.194
Oh.

11:28.195 --> 11:30.595
Oh, my God.

11:35.010 --> 11:38.076
(Steve) What year did this
change from a clinic to a hotel,

11:38.077 --> 11:40.914
or did it go from a clinic to
something else and then a hotel?

11:40.915 --> 11:46.505
Well, it, uh, it remained a
clinic until, uh, 22 years ago.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.596
So I had the opportunity uh...

11:49.597 --> 11:53.626
To rehabilitate this building
into what it is now.

11:53.627 --> 11:56.739
So many people, I would
assume, passed away here.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.217
Many, many, yes.

11:58.218 --> 12:02.838
Many were born, and many passed right here.

12:14.332 --> 12:19.382
(Amy) Like, so I walk in here, and
I'm, like, you know, immediately...

12:19.383 --> 12:20.837
Like, I'm...

12:20.838 --> 12:24.318
Feel like a murder/suicide.

12:26.242 --> 12:27.912
I'm feeling sick, though.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.093
(Inhales sharply, sighs)

12:32.742 --> 12:36.822
There was a body in the bathroom...

12:38.154 --> 12:41.694
And I feel it was a woman.

12:42.642 --> 12:44.562
Mm...

12:46.003 --> 12:50.923
Yeah, I fell sick, though.
I really feel sick.

12:52.776 --> 12:55.776
(Eerie music playing)

13:05.761 --> 13:07.888
(Steve) Hey, Ray. How you doing? I'm Steve.

13:07.889 --> 13:10.171
Pleasure meeting you.

13:10.172 --> 13:13.806
I'm doing an investigation on the
building and its background.

13:13.807 --> 13:16.813
Um, and I'm investigating some of
the things that have been going on.

13:16.814 --> 13:19.029
So I was wondering if
you had any experiences

13:19.030 --> 13:23.118
or you heard of any experiences
that people had here?

13:23.119 --> 13:25.317
Anybody come down and mentioned
to you that they might

13:25.318 --> 13:27.542
have seen an apparition
or something like that?

13:27.543 --> 13:30.963
One lady, she was in 305.

13:31.162 --> 13:34.201
And she swore she saw a...

13:34.202 --> 13:36.448
A shadow or a ghost figure.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.369
Because that's what I asked her. I
said, are you sure it wasn't a shadow?

13:39.370 --> 13:42.143
And she said, no, it was
somebody staring at me.

13:42.144 --> 13:43.978
She said, I could feel the presence.

13:43.979 --> 13:47.655
She came a lot of times after that but...

13:47.656 --> 13:49.860
She never wanted to be in that room again.

13:49.861 --> 13:55.501
- She never wanted to be in 305 again?
- That's correct.

13:59.123 --> 14:00.975
(Steve) So I checked with Jack and Tessa,

14:00.976 --> 14:05.076
and to their knowledge, there have been no
crimes or violent incidents in room 305.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.276
Or anywhere else in the
hotel, for that matter.

14:07.277 --> 14:10.112
But they can't speak for when
this place was a clinic.

14:10.113 --> 14:13.700
From what I'm finding
out about Ybor City...

14:13.701 --> 14:15.914
It has a pretty violent criminal history.

14:15.915 --> 14:20.823
I'm talking execution-style killings,
money laundering, racketeering.

14:20.824 --> 14:23.438
This all sounds like organized crime to me.

14:23.439 --> 14:27.151
But I'm not sure it's Mafia-related,
so I'm gonna go meet with a historian.

14:27.152 --> 14:32.852
Maybe he can shed some light
on the city's violent past.

14:42.126 --> 14:45.528
Ybor City has an era
called the era of blood.

14:45.529 --> 14:48.342
In the early 1900s,
different Mafia factions,

14:48.343 --> 14:50.934
fought for control of Tampa's underground.

14:50.935 --> 14:53.975
And a lot of historians say it was the
Southern version of the Wild West.

14:53.976 --> 14:58.296
There were brothels and gambling houses.

15:03.977 --> 15:07.801
(Amy) I kind of am getting
a little bit of a...

15:07.802 --> 15:10.390
Kind of Mafia thing here.

15:10.391 --> 15:12.948
But this is like... you know,
the thing is, is, like,

15:12.949 --> 15:15.835
not everybody here is Italian, you know?

15:15.836 --> 15:18.863
Um... (Clears throat) It's all races.

15:18.864 --> 15:21.144
And, um...

15:21.825 --> 15:24.285
And dealings.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.110
Lots of people down here.

15:27.111 --> 15:29.708
Laughing. (Clears throat)

15:29.709 --> 15:32.941
I mean, people having a pretty good time.

15:32.942 --> 15:35.668
I feel, like, it went wrong, though.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.735
Like, it went wrong.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.282
I'm not exactly sure how...

15:40.283 --> 15:45.178
But it went wrong in a... in
a big way, it went wrong.

15:45.179 --> 15:47.085
(Paul) Then there was a...

15:47.086 --> 15:52.506
War all the Italian families
here, and it was violent.

15:52.507 --> 15:55.827
With all the murders that
took place around this hotel,

15:55.828 --> 16:01.255
they would probably have taken them to the
closest medical clinic, which was this one.

16:01.256 --> 16:03.536
And, um...

16:04.632 --> 16:07.212
I feel like...

16:09.782 --> 16:12.172
No, I can't say that, not for all of them.

16:12.173 --> 16:16.793
Um, I think that some of them were killed.

16:17.569 --> 16:20.629
(Indistinct whispering)

16:28.731 --> 16:31.851
(Trolley bell clanging)

16:41.711 --> 16:44.351
I feel, like...

16:44.845 --> 16:48.205
Some of them were killed.

16:52.589 --> 16:53.749
(Seagull screeches)

16:53.750 --> 16:56.817
(Steve) Paul gave me a lot of information
about the crime in Ybor City,

16:56.818 --> 16:59.712
but I need more information
about the hotel itself.

16:59.713 --> 17:01.710
So I'm going to meet with a local expert

17:01.711 --> 17:07.050
that can tell me more about
when it was a hospital.

17:13.710 --> 17:16.784
So I understand the location's
an inn now, it's a hotel.

17:16.785 --> 17:17.608
Mm-hmm.

17:17.608 --> 17:20.576
It's been that way for about 11 years,
but I understand way back when,

17:20.577 --> 17:23.115
it was actually a clinic or a hospital.

17:23.116 --> 17:26.751
It was one of the most famous
medical clinics in Tampa.

17:26.752 --> 17:31.587
This was not merely an outpatient
clinic, this was a modern hospital.

17:31.588 --> 17:34.391
The key figure in
understanding that building,

17:34.392 --> 17:38.185
is a man by the name of
Jose Luis Avellanal.

17:38.186 --> 17:41.517
He had so many lives, so many disguises.

17:41.518 --> 17:46.009
Born in Tampa in 1903, the
only child of privilege.

17:46.010 --> 17:50.099
- And his father operated the clinic.
- Was he a doctor?

17:50.100 --> 17:54.218
Honestly, I'm not sure whether
he had a medical degree or not.

17:54.219 --> 17:59.423
He had been investigated, uh, by the
government for running a diploma mill.

17:59.424 --> 18:01.103
So, basically, with this diploma mill,

18:01.104 --> 18:03.788
he could've made himself
anything he wanted to be.

18:03.789 --> 18:06.323
He was anything he wanted to be.

18:06.324 --> 18:09.717
It turned out he went to
Mexico in the mid-1940s.

18:09.718 --> 18:13.700
Bribed his way into creating
this legion of honor.

18:13.701 --> 18:18.069
Which allowed him to be decorated
with the rank of Lieutenant General.

18:18.070 --> 18:23.441
He would not respond to you
unless you called him General.

18:23.442 --> 18:25.628
Now did he eventually
come back to The States?

18:25.629 --> 18:30.262
He did, and stayed in Ybor City
until his death in January 1982.

18:30.263 --> 18:31.273
Never married?

18:31.274 --> 18:35.853
Never married, but claims
in a suicide note...

18:35.854 --> 18:38.255
That he had 500 relationships.

18:38.256 --> 18:40.491
All right, so he decides
to write a suicide note,

18:40.492 --> 18:42.875
- but doesn't kill himself.
- (Chuckles) Yes, yes.

18:42.876 --> 18:46.536
It's a disturbing, rambling...

18:47.202 --> 18:50.969
Jarring portal to his soul, I guess.

18:50.970 --> 18:54.947
Uh, he's writing that no woman
could ever satisfy him.

18:54.948 --> 19:00.348
It's rather a disturbing
document if you look at it.

19:04.182 --> 19:08.742
Okay, so this is not good. (Clears throat)

19:09.425 --> 19:11.467
(Rubbing arms)

19:11.468 --> 19:13.518
(Chuckles nervously)

19:13.519 --> 19:18.135
(Amy) The Mafia presence in the
basement feels strange to me.

19:18.136 --> 19:20.929
I'm getting that this was a hospital.

19:20.930 --> 19:25.149
And now I'm sensing an even darker energy.

19:25.150 --> 19:28.478
And I'm getting a little nervous.

19:28.479 --> 19:31.761
All the bad things that I did.

19:31.762 --> 19:33.899
(Chuckles)

19:33.900 --> 19:35.820
Uh...

19:36.394 --> 19:40.992
And there were different things
done in different rooms.

19:40.993 --> 19:44.654
And, like, you know, it's weird
because it's, like, I hear fire,

19:44.655 --> 19:46.631
but I'm, like, getting this gas.

19:46.632 --> 19:50.944
Like, it's so weird. Like, it's like a gas.

19:50.945 --> 19:53.744
Like, it doesn't really,
like, smell like smoke

19:53.745 --> 19:58.605
or taste like smoke.
It's like a gas almost.

20:00.932 --> 20:04.017
(Gary) The strangest aspect of this,

20:04.018 --> 20:09.418
was Avellanal's obsession
with death and eternal life.

20:09.452 --> 20:13.659
Avellanal, he was constantly
petitioning local boards...

20:13.660 --> 20:16.724
To experiment on cats.

20:16.725 --> 20:19.005
To restore cats' lives.

20:19.006 --> 20:23.715
And God knows whether he was ever
experimenting with humans there,

20:23.716 --> 20:27.886
but he was simply convinced
that only he had the truth.

20:27.887 --> 20:30.087
So he was convinced, in his
brain, he could bring...

20:30.088 --> 20:30.991
Yes.

20:30.992 --> 20:32.919
Dead animals and/or humans back to life.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.780
Yes.

20:39.051 --> 20:42.961
Like, some really wicked
[Bleep] went down here.

20:42.962 --> 20:44.942
Sorry.

20:45.127 --> 20:46.891
Uh, just feel there...

20:46.892 --> 20:50.661
Uh, there's... there's panic going on.

20:50.662 --> 20:52.909
Like, there's confusion going on.

20:52.910 --> 20:55.730
And, um... (Sighs)

20:56.568 --> 20:59.808
Yeah, I'm feeling that.

21:00.181 --> 21:03.762
And there's, like, tunnels.
There's, like, tunnels.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.063
Um, like, there's tunnels.

21:06.064 --> 21:10.924
There's, like, this whole
freaking thing, man.

21:12.784 --> 21:17.160
Now was there any evidence that he
might have used the hospital to...

21:17.161 --> 21:19.235
With this reviving of dead bodies stuff?

21:19.236 --> 21:23.127
Well, if you connect the dots,
I mean, he lived literally...

21:23.128 --> 21:28.799
25 yards from that clinic, and the
family owned that clinic until 1982.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.471
And it's interesting you mentioned
this, there were tunnels in Ybor City.

21:32.472 --> 21:35.919
And it was always assumed, I
think, it was for prohibition.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.305
But that never made sense because
Ybor City was a wide-open town.

21:40.306 --> 21:44.127
So if you wanted to get rid of any
kind of, uh, let's say, evidence,

21:44.128 --> 21:45.821
he could have burned it up at the clinic?

21:45.822 --> 21:48.582
Could have, sure.

21:50.522 --> 21:55.065
Like, there feels, like, there should
have been a way to go through this wall,

21:55.066 --> 21:57.946
to the other room.

22:00.061 --> 22:04.716
(Amy) It's frustrating because I can't
follow these people into the walls.

22:04.717 --> 22:08.091
And so our conversations
keep ending abruptly.

22:08.092 --> 22:09.936
As soon as one person walks away,

22:09.937 --> 22:14.056
another person walks in and
gives me new information.

22:14.057 --> 22:15.988
(Amy) This is a dead guy here.

22:15.989 --> 22:20.726
And, um, it's almost like he's afraid
he's gonna get busted for something.

22:20.727 --> 22:25.162
So he's trying to, like, be quiet about it.

22:25.163 --> 22:27.369
He's definitely dead.

22:27.370 --> 22:28.939
And...

22:28.940 --> 22:30.860
Uh...

22:31.953 --> 22:34.768
(Whispers) Maybe he doesn't know.

22:34.769 --> 22:39.122
Uh... yeah, he doesn't know he's dead.

22:39.123 --> 22:42.363
(Inhales sharply) [Bleep]

22:44.296 --> 22:47.169
Yeah. There's a lot, um...

22:47.170 --> 22:50.350
There's a lot of history here, so...

22:50.351 --> 22:52.077
And, I mean, like, active.

22:52.078 --> 22:54.798
Like, active history here.

22:54.799 --> 22:59.022
What I mean is like a lot
of dead people are here.

22:59.023 --> 23:03.111
(Amy) The longer I stay in the
basement, the more agitated I feel,

23:03.112 --> 23:06.718
because there are so many dead people
down here that want to talk to me,

23:06.719 --> 23:09.312
and they're all trying
to talk to me at once.

23:09.313 --> 23:14.726
I actually... I don't know
if it was a hospital or...

23:14.727 --> 23:19.577
A place for people who,
um, were mentally ill.

23:19.578 --> 23:20.636
(Matt) Mm-hmm.

23:20.637 --> 23:23.943
Um, and I'm still not sure,

23:23.944 --> 23:27.218
really, which one it was.

23:27.219 --> 23:31.254
And then there was a lady
upstairs that was...

23:31.255 --> 23:36.175
Um, seemed to me to be
kind of like a nurse.

23:38.463 --> 23:40.725
So given what you know about
this man right now...

23:40.726 --> 23:44.279
He's a pathological liar,
he's obsessed with the dead.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.504
He's got a narcissistic
personality, to say the least...

23:47.505 --> 23:49.546
Would you be surprised
if tomorrow you found

23:49.547 --> 23:51.789
out there were bodies in his basement?

23:51.790 --> 23:53.590
No.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.224
And there's people coming out of the walls.

23:58.225 --> 24:01.599
There's a lot of people
coming out of the walls.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.660
(Inhales sharply)

24:02.661 --> 24:05.490
- And...
- Are they all related to this event?

24:05.491 --> 24:07.177
And this stuff going down here, or they...

24:07.178 --> 24:10.160
I don't know. It's just,
like, they just all came...

24:10.161 --> 24:13.641
Like, I almost feel like...

24:13.797 --> 24:15.602
Some of them were in the wall.

24:15.603 --> 24:17.834
Like... like...

24:17.835 --> 24:19.963
(Clears throat)

24:19.964 --> 24:23.804
Like, literally. They're a mess.

24:25.988 --> 24:27.613
What do they look like?

24:27.614 --> 24:31.253
They've got, like, crushed faces...

24:31.254 --> 24:33.774
Broken arms...

24:33.872 --> 24:37.422
And they feel... all feel, like,
they're in, like, they're vibrating.

24:37.423 --> 24:39.523
(Groans)

24:39.651 --> 24:42.711
(Indistinct whispering)

24:50.871 --> 24:52.872
(Eerie music playing)

24:52.873 --> 24:55.993
(Trolley bell clanging)

25:01.450 --> 25:04.319
Ooh, and there's people
coming out of the walls.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.262
(Inhales sharply)

25:05.263 --> 25:08.743
Like, I almost feel like...

25:08.903 --> 25:10.675
Some of them were in the wall.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.256
Like... like...

25:14.972 --> 25:16.548
Like, literally.

25:16.549 --> 25:20.186
And they feel... all feel, like,
their inner, like they're vibrating.

25:20.187 --> 25:21.205
(Groans)

25:21.206 --> 25:24.855
Like, they're just in that moment, and...

25:24.856 --> 25:27.160
What moment?

25:27.161 --> 25:28.327
Yeah.

25:28.328 --> 25:30.627
(Amy) These people seem
confused and terrified

25:30.628 --> 25:33.604
because they don't know
how they got in here.

25:33.605 --> 25:39.024
I'm having trouble understanding what they
want because they're in so much pain.

25:39.025 --> 25:43.474
Someone's yelling fire, so...
and that's a male.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.130
Can you describe him?

25:45.131 --> 25:49.495
Um, he's wearing, like,
actually, a really nice suit.

25:49.496 --> 25:55.088
And he has dark brown hair, and
it has, like, the goop in it.

25:55.089 --> 25:57.173
And it's, like, combed back.

25:57.174 --> 26:01.360
And he has a white shirt
on, the suit's dark.

26:01.361 --> 26:03.931
And he has even has, like,
the little bow tie on.

26:03.932 --> 26:08.664
Mm-hmm, no facial hair.
Um, like, strong face.

26:08.665 --> 26:09.958
Yeah.

26:09.959 --> 26:14.459
But he wants to figure out what happened.

26:17.856 --> 26:19.980
(Steve) So I start out looking
for a little old lady,

26:19.981 --> 26:22.543
and I find out that maybe
thousands of people

26:22.544 --> 26:25.620
died in this building when it was a clinic.

26:25.621 --> 26:31.475
Now I discover that the son of the doctor
who ran the clinic was obsessed with death.

26:31.476 --> 26:36.336
He kept journals of bizarre
medical procedures.

26:37.508 --> 26:42.938
And he left a suicide note
which is nine pages of lunacy.

26:42.939 --> 26:46.060
I mean, this guy kind of had the
psych profile of a serial killer.

26:46.061 --> 26:48.110
Charming, he was power-hungry,

26:48.111 --> 26:54.011
and he had plenty of money to basically
do whatever the hell he wanted.

27:06.593 --> 27:09.413
(Voices whispering)

27:16.302 --> 27:18.762
[Bleep] Okay.

27:19.838 --> 27:23.374
Somebody's here, and they're, like...

27:23.375 --> 27:26.268
Is this that other guy?

27:26.269 --> 27:29.473
What... oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh,
oh, I don't like that.

27:29.474 --> 27:31.088
What's going on?

27:31.089 --> 27:32.889
Oh!

27:34.652 --> 27:39.190
Like, a little push, a
little nudge on my back.

27:39.191 --> 27:42.817
I thought it was a female
coming up behind me.

27:42.818 --> 27:44.463
And, uh...

27:44.464 --> 27:47.228
But I'm not sure now.

27:47.229 --> 27:50.613
Because they went away, and then I
was wondering if it was that guy.

27:50.614 --> 27:53.137
Like seriously, I'm getting
chills up and down my back.

27:53.138 --> 27:57.776
Because they're touching me on my back.
(Voices whispering)

27:57.777 --> 28:00.019
Oh, I don't... okay.

28:00.020 --> 28:02.360
(Shuddering)

28:03.148 --> 28:04.330
(Squeals)

28:04.331 --> 28:07.271
I don't like that.

28:13.358 --> 28:17.118
(Amy) Sometimes I get to a point
where I just need to shut down.

28:17.119 --> 28:21.633
The dead people here are angry with
me because I can't help them all.

28:21.634 --> 28:25.894
So now they're starting to attack me.

28:25.962 --> 28:29.862
There's just so much going on that
I'm starting to feel physically ill.

28:29.863 --> 28:33.883
And I think we need to leave now.

28:45.671 --> 28:48.131
(Owl hooting)

28:55.030 --> 28:57.746
I encountered so many
dead people on my walk.

28:57.747 --> 29:01.573
That nobody really stood out,
except for this one man.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.086
Who seemed to be attached to the location.

29:04.087 --> 29:07.858
So I'm gonna have the
sketch artist sketch him.

29:07.859 --> 29:11.459
He is very masculine-looking.

29:12.336 --> 29:14.499
- Square jaw?
- Yes.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.787
Okay.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.998
Uh, light haired, gray haired?

29:17.999 --> 29:20.533
- Oh, dark hair.
- Dark hair, okay.

29:20.534 --> 29:21.923
He has it slicked back.

29:21.924 --> 29:23.859
- Slicked back.
- Black hair.

29:23.860 --> 29:27.760
It's like very, um, suave. Yeah.

29:28.852 --> 29:31.047
Very, um...

29:31.048 --> 29:32.806
Meticulous.

29:32.807 --> 29:35.261
He, uh, definitely was very vain.

29:35.262 --> 29:40.062
And what we would call
today a Metro Sexual.

29:41.159 --> 29:43.825
He would clean his, uh...

29:43.826 --> 29:45.914
- Nails every day.
- Mm hmm.

29:45.915 --> 29:49.452
He would, um, he filed them.

29:49.453 --> 29:53.713
It's like O.C.D. about these things.

29:55.908 --> 30:00.811
He would shave the hair
off of his, um, fingers.

30:00.812 --> 30:03.938
Like he's... like, even,
like, constantly doing this,

30:03.939 --> 30:07.417
with his arm hair to keep it nice.

30:07.418 --> 30:09.445
Like, even the eyebrows,
like, brushing them up

30:09.446 --> 30:15.206
and cutting them to make sure
that they're, like, perfect.

30:16.530 --> 30:18.348
And then, like, you know, he got older,

30:18.349 --> 30:24.049
he had a lot of power and
control over a lot of things.

30:27.218 --> 30:28.410
All right.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.892
Something like that?

30:29.893 --> 30:32.653
Yep, that's him.

30:33.112 --> 30:36.172
(Indistinct whispering)

30:43.147 --> 30:46.147
(Eerie music playing)

30:51.443 --> 30:55.883
(Signal bell clanging, train horn blaring)

31:07.728 --> 31:11.079
(Steve) Amy and I have not seen each other
since the beginning of the investigation.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.707
I have no idea what she's encountered,
what she saw, what she felt.

31:14.708 --> 31:17.692
But now we get to sit down and see
if any of our findings match up.

31:17.693 --> 31:20.295
Amy, this is Tessa and Jack.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.698
They are the owners of the hotel we're in.

31:22.699 --> 31:26.064
They called us in because they've
had some issues with guests,

31:26.065 --> 31:28.879
seeing apparitions and
bizarre events going on.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.899
Okay.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.268
Tessa has actually
encountered an apparition

31:32.269 --> 31:34.777
in the basement in the restroom area.

31:34.778 --> 31:35.606
Okay.

31:35.607 --> 31:37.769
And if you can explain to her what you saw.

31:37.770 --> 31:40.948
It was in the female restroom
in the basement downstairs,

31:40.949 --> 31:45.351
and walked in on a very
dark, dark restroom.

31:45.352 --> 31:47.325
Went to turn the light
on, and there she was.

31:47.326 --> 31:48.356
Okay.

31:48.357 --> 31:51.247
And I actually know that she was of...

31:51.248 --> 31:54.047
Um, hispanic or Spanish descent.

31:54.048 --> 31:56.447
Okay. Very interesting.

31:56.448 --> 32:00.850
Well, I did encounter an
older female in her 70s.

32:00.851 --> 32:03.649
Um, who stayed here for some time.

32:03.650 --> 32:05.451
She was very petite.

32:05.452 --> 32:09.712
Um, she's on the third floor, mainly.

32:10.167 --> 32:13.999
Um, she does have a hispanic heritage.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.644
And she, um, what...

32:16.645 --> 32:20.385
Was some type of nurse or
something like that, a caretaker.

32:20.386 --> 32:23.471
There was a lady upstairs that was...

32:23.472 --> 32:27.156
Um, seemed to me to be
kind of, like, a nurse.

32:27.157 --> 32:28.635
Mm-hmm.

32:28.636 --> 32:32.836
And she's short. She's really short.

32:32.886 --> 32:35.890
Now you don't know this, but
your father informed me

32:35.891 --> 32:39.330
that he actually saw something himself.

32:39.331 --> 32:42.008
And I was really the only
person he's ever told.

32:42.009 --> 32:46.004
I didn't want to look
foolish, uh, in that respect.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.855
So I was allowed to look
foolish with my story,

32:47.856 --> 32:49.768
telling everybody all these
years, and you just,

32:49.769 --> 32:54.077
- you know, keep it to yourself.
- I never, never told anybody.

32:54.078 --> 32:57.438
I saw a very small lady.

32:58.045 --> 33:03.945
And I looked at her, and she just
was there looking back at me.

33:04.318 --> 33:07.019
Who do you think my lady was?
Do you think it was her?

33:07.020 --> 33:09.740
- Maybe the same...
- I think it was probably the same...

33:09.741 --> 33:12.108
The same woman, so...

33:12.109 --> 33:16.563
The little nurse is a very
active presence here.

33:16.564 --> 33:21.356
She feels a responsibility
to continue doing her job.

33:21.357 --> 33:25.004
And I think that's why she presented
herself to Jack and Tessa.

33:25.005 --> 33:27.972
To let them know that she's still here.

33:27.973 --> 33:31.393
I'm happy that I'm sane.

33:31.641 --> 33:35.178
Because that lady, that
really threw me for a loop.

33:35.179 --> 33:39.759
That's why I never told anyone
in my family, any of my friends.

33:39.760 --> 33:44.691
But I know that someone
interviewed our front desk, Ray.

33:44.692 --> 33:47.687
I was wondering how that came out?

33:47.688 --> 33:51.529
Well, when I spoke to Ray, I specifically
asked him if he'd seen anything,

33:51.530 --> 33:54.491
because I had heard from you two guys.

33:54.492 --> 33:57.032
He hadn't, but he said a couple of guests,

33:57.033 --> 34:01.833
did mention a shadowy
figure in a room, 305.

34:01.955 --> 34:03.712
- Yes.
- Okay.

34:03.713 --> 34:05.824
305 was unusual.

34:05.825 --> 34:09.965
Um, as soon as I opened the door...

34:10.568 --> 34:12.342
Immediately...

34:12.342 --> 34:16.422
Like, I feel like a murder/suicide.

34:16.960 --> 34:21.400
I'm feeling sick, though. (Groans, sighs)

34:23.252 --> 34:26.042
There was a body in the bathroom.

34:26.043 --> 34:29.583
And I feel it was a woman.

34:30.771 --> 34:32.434
Well, it was a hospital.

34:32.435 --> 34:34.889
Well, all the rooms here
were hospital rooms.

34:34.891 --> 34:37.918
People were... died there, treated there.

34:37.918 --> 34:38.753
Okay.

34:38.754 --> 34:41.848
- So each room...
- It was really bad and very intense.

34:41.849 --> 34:43.505
Saw many stories.

34:43.507 --> 34:47.337
Ybor City has a tremendous,
tremendous history

34:47.338 --> 34:50.670
as far as, um, the Mafia
and the mob down here.

34:50.672 --> 34:54.145
The beginning of the 1920s, there was
a time of, a span of almost 30 years.

34:54.146 --> 34:56.272
There was a big mob war down here.

34:56.273 --> 34:58.064
They called it the era of blood.

34:58.065 --> 35:00.739
Because there was so much
violence so many homicides,

35:00.740 --> 35:03.622
so many murders because of the gambling.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.925
Most of those victims came here.

35:05.926 --> 35:08.479
- This was the only clinic in the area.
- Okay.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.227
So you're gonna have,

35:10.228 --> 35:13.113
I don't know how many murders within
a year that actually wound up...

35:13.114 --> 35:14.835
Even if they were alive when they got here,

35:14.836 --> 35:17.142
they may have eventually passed
away when they were here.

35:17.143 --> 35:18.954
Does that make any sense to you?
Does that...

35:18.955 --> 35:20.039
Yes, it does.

35:20.040 --> 35:23.413
There was a character here that
lived here for many, many years.

35:23.414 --> 35:25.574
His name was Jose Luis Avellanal.

35:25.575 --> 35:30.511
Now this guy was a handsome,
tall, charismatic guy.

35:30.512 --> 35:34.712
Real narcissist. Meticulous
the way he dressed.

35:34.713 --> 35:38.028
- Does that sound familiar to you at all?
- Yes, it does.

35:38.029 --> 35:43.162
Well, you know what? I have
a photo of, uh, this guy.

35:43.163 --> 35:46.230
I want you to take a look at it.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.091
Wow!

35:48.804 --> 35:51.864
(Indistinct whispering)

36:02.950 --> 36:06.070
(Trolley bell clanging)

36:06.552 --> 36:11.850
(Steve) Well, you know what? I
have a photo of, uh, this guy.

36:11.851 --> 36:14.920
I want you to take a look at it.

36:14.921 --> 36:16.781
Wow!

36:21.068 --> 36:24.911
What I normally do during our investigation
is put her together with a sketch artist.

36:24.912 --> 36:27.104
As far as, uh, who she encounters.

36:27.105 --> 36:30.009
So I had a sketch artist come in.

36:30.010 --> 36:35.910
And they seal it. I don't get to
see it until now, actually, so...

36:42.169 --> 36:44.293
Well, tell me what you think.

36:44.294 --> 36:45.858
That's pretty close. (Chuckles)

36:45.859 --> 36:47.184
Wow, that's incredible.

36:47.185 --> 36:50.103
That's kind of the outfit that
he had on with the bow tie.

36:50.104 --> 36:52.024
Yeah.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.182
The eyes, I think. Yeah.

37:01.183 --> 37:03.184
(Amy) When I encounter the dead,

37:03.185 --> 37:07.689
they project themselves how
they want me to see them.

37:07.690 --> 37:10.923
So it's always kind of shocking when,

37:10.924 --> 37:14.977
I see an actual photograph
of someone I've met.

37:14.978 --> 37:16.399
(Steve) What was your take on him?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.727
I mean, what kind of a
person do you think he was?

37:18.728 --> 37:21.875
Well, he definitely had
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

37:21.876 --> 37:23.212
That's the first thing.

37:23.213 --> 37:26.924
He was in some type of a powerful position.

37:26.925 --> 37:28.613
Just because,

37:28.614 --> 37:31.389
he had that authority.

37:31.390 --> 37:36.404
Um, confidence that you get from being
in some type of power position.

37:36.405 --> 37:37.779
Okay.

37:37.780 --> 37:40.131
Let me paint a little picture of, uh...

37:40.132 --> 37:41.250
Mr. Avellanal.

37:41.251 --> 37:44.453
He had a diploma mill that he ran.

37:44.454 --> 37:48.009
And he gave himself diplomas.

37:48.010 --> 37:50.001
And he was selling them, also.

37:50.002 --> 37:54.179
But he was a doctor, a lawyer, a
minister, name it, he was it.

37:54.180 --> 37:58.940
He was so far into this being powerful,
he used to actually walk around...

37:58.941 --> 38:03.090
In a Mexican General's outfit
through Tampa and Ybor City.

38:03.091 --> 38:05.279
So to give you an idea of
what kind of a guy he was.

38:05.280 --> 38:09.177
And you'll see this stuff. He was
really into trying to revive the dead.

38:09.178 --> 38:13.374
He used to actually write letters
to the Mayo clinic, Harvard.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.428
They all rejected him.

38:15.429 --> 38:20.085
Because they realized the guy's out of
his mind, but he would experiment...

38:20.086 --> 38:22.925
Using this type of stuff
for reviving the dead.

38:22.926 --> 38:26.834
This was the kind of machinery
he used to do that.

38:26.835 --> 38:31.742
And there's rumors that he might
have experimented on cats, animals.

38:31.743 --> 38:35.972
Now Jose Luis actually lived right diagonal
from here, at the El Pasaje hotel.

38:35.973 --> 38:39.707
In his younger years, he actually
wrote a 9-page suicide note.

38:39.708 --> 38:45.350
Now in this note, he talks
about how many women he's had.

38:45.351 --> 38:48.837
He had over 500 women in his life,
and none of them could satisfy him.

38:48.838 --> 38:51.027
Talked about taking over the world.

38:51.028 --> 38:54.503
This is all in the same note, and
he talks about committing suicide,

38:54.504 --> 38:57.444
which he never did.

38:57.649 --> 39:00.986
You know, I was really
interested in Avellanal for,

39:00.987 --> 39:03.108
a lot of the bad things that happened here.

39:03.109 --> 39:06.413
You know, kind of everything
was pointing towards him.

39:06.414 --> 39:09.253
Do you think this guy killed anyone?

39:09.254 --> 39:11.054
No.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.014
Even though the guy, in my
opinion, is a sociopath,

39:15.015 --> 39:17.060
he's a lunatic, he's a liar, narcissistic.

39:17.061 --> 39:21.801
He, yeah, definitely he
didn't kill anybody.

39:21.983 --> 39:26.116
(Amy) Steve uncovered some unflattering
information about Avellanal.

39:26.117 --> 39:30.022
But when I met Avellanal,
he seemed more confused,

39:30.023 --> 39:33.203
about his own death than anything else.

39:33.204 --> 39:36.045
He was definitely an eccentric man.

39:36.046 --> 39:39.509
But I don't think that
he was ever dangerous.

39:39.510 --> 39:42.322
And I don't think that he'll be a threat,

39:42.323 --> 39:46.283
to Jack or Tessa or their guests.

39:46.615 --> 39:49.650
All I know is what I got, and...

39:49.651 --> 39:54.514
You know, my concern is, is always trying
to keep it as accurate as possible.

39:54.515 --> 39:57.486
I'm not saying that everything I uncover
is gonna jive with what you find.

39:57.487 --> 39:59.308
- Right.
- But I just in this case...

39:59.309 --> 40:02.371
I thought there was relevance there. But
if she says it isn't, it isn't so...

40:02.372 --> 40:04.342
(Steve) You've been a
Detective as long as I have,

40:04.343 --> 40:06.841
you know that you've got to go
by your gut instincts sometimes.

40:06.842 --> 40:09.694
And my gut tells me Avellanal
was up to no good.

40:09.695 --> 40:12.310
But I have to go with Amy's
findings on this one.

40:12.311 --> 40:14.895
Avellanal, did he... why is he here?

40:14.896 --> 40:17.956
Well, I think that...

40:18.013 --> 40:20.409
Because he did have such a
strong attachment to it,

40:20.410 --> 40:24.566
it is a place that he was familiar
with and is familiar with.

40:24.567 --> 40:27.904
So that may be why he comes and goes.

40:27.905 --> 40:29.536
Um...

40:29.537 --> 40:32.625
He wasn't present the entire time.

40:32.626 --> 40:35.437
So I'm not sure if he stays
here all the time or not.

40:35.438 --> 40:40.876
But a lot of dead will just kind
of converge sometimes at places.

40:40.877 --> 40:43.778
Um, and being that this was a hospital,

40:43.779 --> 40:48.230
a lot of people were brought
here to the morgue.

40:48.231 --> 40:51.711
Like, I almost feel like...

40:51.956 --> 40:54.940
Some of them were in the wall, like...

40:54.941 --> 40:57.026
Like, literally.

40:57.027 --> 40:59.727
They're a mess.

41:01.017 --> 41:02.637
What do they look like?

41:02.638 --> 41:06.207
They've got, like, crushed faces...

41:06.208 --> 41:08.608
Broken arms.

41:08.619 --> 41:10.854
And they all feel, like, their inner...

41:10.855 --> 41:13.658
Like they're vibrating, like... (Groans)

41:13.659 --> 41:15.976
The people who fell out of the wall...

41:15.977 --> 41:19.385
Um, which I'm kind of
relating to the morgue.

41:19.386 --> 41:22.350
Now, the only thing with them
is just they want to leave,

41:22.351 --> 41:25.129
they're not harmful in any way,
they're just normal people

41:25.130 --> 41:27.982
that are, like, hey, I want to leave now.

41:27.983 --> 41:31.032
But you are safe, the guests are safe,

41:31.033 --> 41:34.220
and the nurse is still
working and doing her job,

41:34.221 --> 41:36.980
taking care of everybody, you know?

41:36.981 --> 41:40.150
- That's what we want is a happy place.
- Yeah.

41:40.151 --> 41:44.302
(Amy) Hotels can be hard to investigate,
especially in cases like this.

41:44.303 --> 41:47.470
Jack and Tessa have entity's
that are happy to be here.

41:47.471 --> 41:50.752
And they have entity's who
no longer want to be here.

41:50.753 --> 41:54.921
But like the living sometimes all
the dead want is to be heard.

41:54.922 --> 41:57.713
And now that their story's have been told.

41:57.714 --> 42:00.155
I think many of them are ready to move on.

42:00.156 --> 42:02.405
Everyone will benefit in the end.

42:02.406 --> 42:05.088
Both the living and the dead.

42:05.089 --> 42:10.989
