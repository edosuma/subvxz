WEBVTT

00:12.179 --> 00:14.806
-That was all right, wasn't it?
-Yeah. Yes.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.646
-I think it's better now, isn't it?
-I agree. Yeah.

00:20.729 --> 00:24.775
Well, pressure's off, innit?
There's no cycles, ovulation windows.

00:24.858 --> 00:30.781
I feel like I'm a professional
tennis player who's retired.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.281
And now that I'm playing for fun,

00:32.366 --> 00:36.203
I've sort of, like,
fallen back in love with the game.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.207
It's nice not to use protection
as well, innit?

00:40.290 --> 00:44.628
You know, you just gotta,
you know, plug and play.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.006
I think it's just nature
evening things up.

00:48.090 --> 00:52.761
Blind people get great hearing,
infertile people get great sex!

00:55.973 --> 00:57.015
Hello.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.892
Right.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.441
Jason!

01:07.234 --> 01:08.610
Jason!

01:14.116 --> 01:15.117
What?

01:15.993 --> 01:17.661
It's from the adoption people.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.912
-Is it?
-Yeah.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.373
-Don't you want to open it?
-No, no. I know what it says.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.583
It says we don't give children

01:22.666 --> 01:25.002
to people who admit they drink too much,
smoke and have no money.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.837
Okay. All right.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.682
It's fine, it's fine. Just tell me.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.352
-Jason.
-It says-- It says...

01:44.229 --> 01:46.023
...nothing.
It's just more forms, by the looks of it.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.107
-What?
-Yeah.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.192
-They didn't reject us?
-No.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.818
-We're still in with a chance?
-It looks like it.

01:49.902 --> 01:50.903
-How?
-I don't know.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.071
Maybe they're so desperate
for people, they'll take anyone.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.448
That's so great.

02:00.829 --> 02:04.499
Look, I think this is gonna be
a pretty long, drawn-out process.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.836
So maybe we should just, you know,
pace ourselves, take it easy.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.295
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.423
-Absolutely, absolutely.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

02:11.507 --> 02:14.259
I'm gonna go get a pen. I'm so excited.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.493
-Jason.
-Yeah.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.578
-We need to talk.
-Why, is something wrong?

02:42.538 --> 02:44.540
You got problems, dude.

02:44.623 --> 02:48.168
You "have" problems, dude.
Have problems.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.837
Hi.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.631
Do we have to have the talk again?

02:53.173 --> 02:56.385
Alisha, I've got to vary the lessons.
They're getting bored.

02:56.468 --> 02:57.511
How many times?

02:58.136 --> 03:02.182
You cannot teach English
through Rihanna songs and football chants.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.435
This is a business,
not Dead Poets Society.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.520
I know, but it--

03:06.603 --> 03:09.481
Look, I have half the budget
and half the time I need

03:09.565 --> 03:11.650
to do this job properly.

03:11.733 --> 03:15.946
And I'm too exhausted to argue.
Just work the textbook.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.906
Yeah, but the textbooks are old.
They need new ones.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.491
Well, we can't afford them.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.785
I mean, the maps have still got
Yugoslavia on 'em.

03:21.869 --> 03:26.874
Okay, let me explain something to you:
Britain is done.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.250
It is done.

03:28.333 --> 03:32.462
It is old, and it is dying,
and no one is coming here.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.007
And when people don't come,
neither does their money.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.677
Alisha, we promise these kids a lot.
We're not meeting their expectations.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.264
They're from Eastern Europe.
They don't have any expectations.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.934
I saw two of them in the toilets
taking a selfie with a Dyson Airblade.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.102
No, you didn't.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.521
Just get them out and into jobs

03:49.605 --> 03:51.982
so they can send money
back to their haggard families.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.238
Yeah, I know you wanna be at the birth,

03:58.322 --> 04:02.159
but it's just a very busy time for us
and we just don't have the cars.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.495
Right. Yeah, no.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.749
I know you're frustrated.
I do. I understand that.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.375
But this really isn't our fault.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.544
You know, maybe your sister
shouldn't have got pregnant

04:12.628 --> 04:14.838
exactly nine months before a bank holiday.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.757
Do you know what I mean?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.678
Is Ruby about?
Just need her to proofread some contracts.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.348
I could do that if you want.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.975
Okay, yeah.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.522
No, it's okay. I'll--

04:32.356 --> 04:34.483
Yeah. No. Thanks, though.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.988
Well, I literally don't know
how to help you.

04:42.241 --> 04:45.202
Yeah. Have you thought
about getting the bus?

04:47.538 --> 04:50.958
Right, and exactly how far
is Cornwall from Scotland?

04:53.085 --> 04:54.545
Yeah, that is far.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.843
Let's see what we've got then.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.887
-Crisps?
-Yeah.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.389
-And 7UP?
-Lovely.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.683
It's a support group, not a sleepover.

05:08.892 --> 05:12.187
-Oh, my God, barbecue?
-Well, we love barbecue.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.856
They're French.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.440
Did you get them from the
guy at the market

05:15.524 --> 05:17.025
that we said we weren't
gonna go to anymore?

05:17.109 --> 05:18.360
-He's all right.
-Jase.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.488
He sold me some tartar sauce
that was best before 2002.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.450
Barbecue. They're not sophisticated.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.161
-Why didn't you get the posh flavors?
-What's the posh flavors?

05:28.245 --> 05:29.246
Right. It goes:

05:29.329 --> 05:32.332
sea salt and cracked black pepper,
salt and balsamic vinegar,

05:32.416 --> 05:34.960
lightly salted,
cheese and onion, prawn cocktail,

05:35.043 --> 05:37.880
and then chicken at the bottom,
and then barbecue.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.428
Jase, you've got a stain.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.805
Yeah, I know.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.473
I wetted it and then it was damp,

05:48.557 --> 05:50.225
so I couldn't see
if it was still there or not.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.310
Hang on...

05:54.438 --> 05:56.648
-Made it worse.
-Yeah, I know.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.192
Don't worry about it.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.360
Hello.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.363
We didn't bring a rug.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.157
All right, mate?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.076
-Hiya.
-Hello, hi. Marcus.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.536
-I'm Nikki.
-Hello, Nikki.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.621
Hello, Marcus. Jason.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.331
-Jason, nice to meet you.
-Yeah, nice to meet you.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.083
-Brought some things for the...
-Thank you.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.796
Yeah, you know,
should we pop this under the table

06:19.880 --> 06:21.256
-outta the sun for now?
-Yeah, okay.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.884
There we go. Thank you.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.136
-Is this all up for grabs, Marcus? Yeah?
-You help yourself.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.387
-Yeah, yeah.
-Thank you.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.472
Lovely.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.183
Cracking spread.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.311
So, are all these people adopting?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.395
Trying to.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.106
The borough's pretty oversubscribed.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.483
-God.
-Bloody hell.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.734
Excuse me, I'm just gonna...

06:40.817 --> 06:42.778
-Okay.
-Fair, mate.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.115
Never really thought
about there being competition.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.326
Don't worry. We got game.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.662
Jason, really.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.829
Out of all these people here,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.207
why would they give a kid to a bloke
who just licked his own top?

06:56.333 --> 06:59.044
There's a razor-thin line
between the T-shirts you wear to bed

06:59.127 --> 07:00.629
and the ones you wear during the day.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.713
Step it up.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.010
Well, I suppose we're all just waiting

07:07.094 --> 07:09.596
to see the long-term effects
of the regional adoption agencies.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.681
Yeah.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.724
The Adoption Support Fund's
been given 12 million,

07:12.808 --> 07:15.686
-which is, you know, a drop in the ocean.
-It's amazing.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.689
Right, yeah. Of course.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.108
So, what is it that you both do?

07:21.191 --> 07:22.943
I'm an educational consultant.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.778
Cool.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.697
-And...
-Journalist, political.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.159
Financial advisor.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.328
My wife's an artist, ceramics.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.538
Cardiologist.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.706
Solicitor.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.917
A filmmaker. Wildlife documentaries.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.377
I work for the council.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.671
Okay.

07:42.754 --> 07:46.967
Yeah, I'm the strategic lead for business
development and commercial partnerships.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.014
Have you done much prep reading?

07:53.432 --> 07:55.976
-Have you read The Connected Parent?
-No.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.519
It's great on bonding.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.604
-Is it?
-No.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.105
Five Stages of Infant Attachment?

08:01.315 --> 08:04.067
I think we said we wanted to wait
for the film on that one, didn't we?

08:06.945 --> 08:09.114
We've been told they like you
to have experience with kids,

08:09.198 --> 08:10.699
so we've been volunteering.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.868
Yeah, and luckily my work
gives me a lot of exposure.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.370
What is it that you do exactly?

08:15.454 --> 08:16.872
Educational consultant?

08:16.955 --> 08:19.833
I work with adults
with learning and behavioral difficulties.

08:19.917 --> 08:20.918
No way. So do I.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.086
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:23.921 --> 08:24.922
My boss.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.467
Your boss has behavioral difficulties?

08:30.135 --> 08:31.220
No.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.306
-Sorry, I don't understand.
-It was a joke. I was just--

08:35.557 --> 08:38.809
'Cause she's a pain in the ass.
No, she's all there.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.354
All right.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.858
So, what do you do?

08:46.151 --> 08:48.278
Me? I teach English as a foreign language.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.949
I did that for a summer when I was 18.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.868
Yeah. Lot of fun. Lot of fun.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.664
Oh, God.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.208
We're competing against
the cream here, Jase.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.627
Yeah. Maybe we should just
move to a shittier borough, hey?

09:03.710 --> 09:05.128
Yeah, maybe.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.632
I mean, that Ben man talked to me
about American politics for 30 minutes.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.551
-God.
-I couldn't talk about any politics

09:10.634 --> 09:11.927
for 30 minutes.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.013
Well, not unless
I talked really, really slowly.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.851
Hang on. Magic.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.489
So, this group's a little like prison.

09:32.573 --> 09:35.158
You're not supposed to ask
why people are here, but...

09:35.242 --> 09:37.578
Well, we had some fertility issues.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.871
I'm so sorry.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.914
Cheesecake's out.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.833
-Hello.
-This is Luke. Luke, this is Jason.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.002
-Jason. How are you, mate?
-Yeah, nice to meet you.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.212
IVF?

09:47.296 --> 09:50.465
Yeah. We tried it, but it's complicated.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.926
Juice not worth the squeeze,
Luke, if you know what I mean.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.845
My window wasn't as big as other people's.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.930
-No.
-I should have been sluttier in my 20s.

09:57.014 --> 10:00.184
-Well, you gave it a good go.
-Yeah, I did.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.438
So, why are you adopting?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.690
We both have penises.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.985
-That makes sense, yeah.
-And where are you at with it all?

10:10.068 --> 10:11.486
-We're going for our second.
-Wow.

10:11.570 --> 10:12.905
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.991
-This is Jade, our first.
-Stop it.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.701
-Gorge.
-Absolutely beautiful.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.870
-She's so beautiful.
-Actually, really beautiful, man.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.623
-I hate you so much.
-Yeah, we've been really lucky.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.542
Passed panel first time.
Got the child of our dreams.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.753
Getting on really well
with the biological parents.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.213
That is so good to hear.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.633
Honestly, it's amazing.
You're gonna love it.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.469
Oh, God. I mean, can we adopt you?
Like, is that--

10:35.552 --> 10:36.887
Well, I only wanna give you a hug.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.597
-Is he available?
-I'm gonna do it. I'm giving a hug.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.141
Here, Jase. Can you hold my drink?
Come here.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.226
This is good.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.145
All right. Careful, he's not on fire.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.940
All right, should we go? Just--

10:50.359 --> 10:53.153
-Handshake. All right, then.
-Come here.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.613
This is nice.

10:59.660 --> 11:00.661
Thanks, guys.

11:03.497 --> 11:07.709
-I see you met Luke and Kwame.
-Yeah, so nice, so positive.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.003
Yeah. But then, I would be too.

11:10.087 --> 11:14.758
I think it's a bit easier when you're,
you know, black.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.388
Yeah, this area has a lot
of minority kids,

11:19.471 --> 11:22.766
and they like to, you know, "match."

11:22.850 --> 11:25.018
Yeah. Well, I mean,
that makes sense, doesn't it?

11:29.648 --> 11:30.732
Good to go?

11:33.694 --> 11:34.903
Have you got worms?

11:35.988 --> 11:37.531
They're just a couple of racists.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.242
The sort of people who think
immigrants get all the council houses.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.911
-No, they didn't look racist.
-You can't tell anymore.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.997
It's all white-collar now.
It's been gentrified.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.623
We're at the bottom of the queue.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.751
They all go to museums and art galleries.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.379
-They have degrees.
-Degrees don't mean anything.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.591
Yeah, you can say that. You all have one.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.176
Yeah, but theirs are from Portsmouth.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.596
-It's a good uni.
-It's a conference center with a motto.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.681
It's top 15 in sports science.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.559
He's literally got a degree in burpees.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.936
This doesn't work when I do it.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.104
Can you...

12:11.940 --> 12:13.275
Doesn't mean anything.

12:14.443 --> 12:15.527
Yeah.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.197
You should read
The Connected Parent though.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.281
It's great on bonding.

12:21.700 --> 12:27.289
Turn to page 22 in the textbooks.
We're gonna look at greetings.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.291
Formal and informal greet-- Yes?

12:29.374 --> 12:31.877
-The answers are already in here.
-What?

12:31.960 --> 12:35.214
Someone has written already
the answers in the book.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.298
-Really?
-Yeah.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.967
-Has everyone got that?
-Yes.

12:40.135 --> 12:43.514
I'm sorry. Um, all right. So let--

12:44.389 --> 12:46.016
Everyone put their left hand
over the answers

12:46.099 --> 12:47.267
that have been written in their book.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.852
What is "tosser"?

12:49.770 --> 12:51.146
What? What's "tosser"?

12:51.230 --> 12:52.648
Tosser.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.817
Well, it's-- Let's have a look.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.448
Wow, yeah.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.868
This is quite offensive.

13:05.744 --> 13:09.456
We need new books.
We pay our money for this.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.167
I know.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.088
Listen, though, do you know what?
This is good.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.589
Actually, this is good,

13:17.673 --> 13:19.800
'cause if you're gonna work
with English people,

13:19.883 --> 13:22.010
then you're gonna need to know
these words.

13:22.845 --> 13:27.099
Okay, right. No, this is good.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.726
Toss-er.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.146
Any other words you've come across
that you might not understand?

13:33.230 --> 13:34.189
"Knobhead"?

13:35.440 --> 13:36.441
Knobhead.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.569
It's a silent K.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.655
Knob as in "penis," head.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.032
Lovely. Anything else?

13:44.116 --> 13:45.659
"Wanker."

13:46.118 --> 13:47.953
-"Wanker."
-Wanker.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.288
Wanker, exactly.

13:49.371 --> 13:55.544
Wank-er. Wanker. There you go.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.173
Hi.

14:33.749 --> 14:38.003
So, it's basically a competition
and the winner gets a kid?

14:39.463 --> 14:43.217
-Try not to think of it like that, Jen.
-So, everyone gets a kid?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.427
-No.
-So, how do they decide?

14:46.261 --> 14:48.013
It's just based on
how good a candidate you are.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.683
Right. Does sound like a competition.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.688
Sort of think it can't be that hard
if Madonna did it.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.815
No, I don't think
she went through the council.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.484
She sort of went direct.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.071
-Ruby, have you got those contracts?
-The ones you wanted proofread?

15:04.154 --> 15:05.906
Fantastic. Thank you. Oh, you're great.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.241
-Thank you. Cheers.
-Anytime.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.380
-Hey.
-Hello.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.800
-Want some?
-I've just-- I'm trying to give up.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.051
Yeah.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.219
Good to you.

15:34.685 --> 15:37.187
-Sorry to be complaining.
-That's okay.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.358
I need to speak better for work.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.610
-Do you have work?
-Yeah.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.196
In restaurant only.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.700
What would you like to do?
Where would you like to work?

15:49.783 --> 15:52.077
-I'm a teacher.
-No way.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.580
Yeah. Was a teacher at home.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.498
I just need to...

15:57.207 --> 15:58.208
Speak better.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.293
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.339
Right. Well, listen,
you're not gonna get what you need here.

16:04.423 --> 16:08.135
So, you should maybe think
about some private tuition.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.097
-I have no money.
-Right.

16:12.181 --> 16:13.849
Which you can't get
until you get a better job,

16:13.932 --> 16:16.476
-which you can't get until you can...
-Speak better.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.354
Right, yeah, yes.

16:19.438 --> 16:20.439
Yeah.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.737
Listen, if you want,
I could give you some extra help.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.406
-I have no money, remember?
-Yeah, I know.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.034
But I don't need money. So...

16:32.117 --> 16:34.161
-What? Really?
-Yeah, it's fine.

16:36.705 --> 16:37.956
Thank you.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.958
-It's okay.
-Cool.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.507
Don't worry too much
about reading all of these.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.093
It's 80% making sure you've got wet wipes.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.639
And it'll be easier for you 'cause you can
just drink all the way through it.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.433
I mean, I sort of did too,
but you're not supposed to.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.355
And your body's not gonna change.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.316
I really miss my tits.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.609
I used to have spectacular tits.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.613
I mean, I love my kids.
I wouldn't swap my kids for my tits.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.031
Okay, well, no. That's good.

17:11.114 --> 17:14.492
But if I could just
have my tits at, like, weekends

17:14.576 --> 17:17.246
and then get the kids back
on Monday, then I'd probably do that.

17:25.921 --> 17:28.006
I don't think
it's supposed to feel like this.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.178
It didn't with Lauren.

17:35.764 --> 17:36.849
Hey.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.815
How are things with Freddy?

17:46.692 --> 17:48.151
Right, still no sex.

17:50.153 --> 17:53.949
He says that he has been
emotionally scarred by the birth.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.535
Wow. Right.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.496
Okay, well,
that's quite an annoying thing to say.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.583
Because you were actually
scarred by the birth.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.210
Yeah, he can be quite an annoying person.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.298
No, it's fine. It's just a difficult time.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.550
It'll pass.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.973
Oh, God. They are lovely.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.523
Let's go out. I'll buy you dinner.

18:26.607 --> 18:28.984
Yeah? I mean,
I think you sort of have to now.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.037
I booked us tickets to a lecture.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.082
-On purpose?
-Yes, on purpose.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.630
It's more of a talk on child psychology.

18:49.713 --> 18:52.132
-Luke and Kwame go to them.
-All right.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.051
Jase, this is just something
that we do now.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.219
Okay.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.388
Also, we should start watching the news.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.349
-I already watch the news.
-Do ya?

19:00.432 --> 19:03.977
Yes, I do. Sometimes it's nice to see
someone else having a worse day than you.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.525
What you doing?

19:09.608 --> 19:10.734
Lesson plan.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.197
-You got nice writing.
-Why, thank you.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.075
It's nice how your generation
values good penmanship.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.333
Get off me.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.503
Get-- J, get off me.

19:33.841 --> 19:36.343
It's a queue.
You bought us tickets to a queue.

19:36.426 --> 19:37.511
Stop it.

19:39.972 --> 19:43.642
Twenty pounds?
For a book we're not even gonna read?

19:43.725 --> 19:46.186
You have to buy the book.
It's rude otherwise.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.480
-How long is it?
-It's about, I don't know, 400 pages.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.816
-No, I mean the lecture.
-It's one hour.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.569
-Then another hour.
-Mate.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.904
It's just 20 minutes after that.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.616
What's it even about?

20:00.659 --> 20:03.370
"Sub-- Subjectivity speak--"
How am I gonna understand the lecture

20:03.453 --> 20:05.497
if I can't understand
the title of his book?

20:05.581 --> 20:06.790
Twenty pound-- All right, mate.

20:06.874 --> 20:07.875
Hiya.

20:08.959 --> 20:11.587
Could you put, "To Nikki and Jason.

20:11.670 --> 20:15.132
Thank you for coming.
Always keep learning.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.595
And good luck with the adoption"?

20:27.352 --> 20:28.353
Sorry.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.111
That was weird.

20:36.195 --> 20:38.655
Shut up.
I get nervous around clever people.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.668
-Got all the gear, haven't you?
-Yeah.

20:51.752 --> 20:54.796
-Three different color highlighters?
-Yeah, 'cause we might need them.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.965
-Got your compass in there?
-No.

20:57.049 --> 20:59.218
-Set square?
-It's not that kind of lecture.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.261
-Protractor?
-Shut up.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.848
Welcome, and thank you so much for coming.

21:04.932 --> 21:08.393
Okay, so, let's slay some dragons.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.230
What I propose is a link

21:11.313 --> 21:17.778
between Winnicott's transitional object
and Lacan's objet petit a...

21:18.779 --> 21:22.991
...viewed in the context of the child's
development of desire and subjectivity.

21:24.034 --> 21:27.704
-And so, let Winnicott be our guide.
-"Allcock."

21:27.788 --> 21:31.625
On this, I can really recommend
his whole oeuvre.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.460
In fact, I would recommend everyone...

21:33.544 --> 21:34.962
-What's an oeuvre?
-Don't embarrass me.

21:35.045 --> 21:38.257
...in this room to go right back
to his clinical notes on child disorder...

21:38.340 --> 21:45.055
So, we've understood
self as subject, self as object

21:45.138 --> 21:48.016
and the self with object.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.353
Okay, I think we'll
take a short break here.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.522
Is everyone happy
if I lose this from the screen?

21:53.605 --> 21:55.649
Oh, no, no. Hang on. Hang on.

22:00.404 --> 22:01.405
Great.

22:02.239 --> 22:06.451
When we come back,
we'll be moving on to self as other.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.996
There be monsters.

22:11.957 --> 22:14.126
Is that it? All right, thank God for that.
Come on, let's go.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.752
No, I'm enjoying it. I'm learning a lot.

22:15.836 --> 22:17.588
You don't understand this
any more than I do.

22:17.671 --> 22:18.672
Yes, I do.

22:18.755 --> 22:21.717
Says the woman who had to pause
Avengers: Infinity War every five minutes.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.845
-Come on.
-At least I'm trying.

22:24.928 --> 22:27.598
What's the matter?

22:29.558 --> 22:31.393
-What's the matter?
-You're not taking it seriously.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.644
'Cause this isn't us.

22:32.728 --> 22:35.814
We hate stuff like this. We make fun
out of people who come to stuff like this.

22:35.898 --> 22:37.900
Well, maybe I'm tired
of being that person.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.617
Nikki.

22:47.117 --> 22:51.330
-Nikki. Hey. What's going on?
-No, I don't want to talk about it.

22:52.206 --> 22:53.207
Okay.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.669
I want to have something to say
when I talk to these people.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.839
-What people?
-You know, the people.

23:00.923 --> 23:03.383
The people, Jason.
The people that are gonna be judging us

23:03.467 --> 23:05.302
and taking notes on everything
we say from now on.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.388
You've met one bloke who's read a book
on American politics and you flip out.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.475
-Yeah, because I'm sick of feeling stupid!
-Nikki, you are not--

23:11.558 --> 23:14.811
Sorry, but I am. I'm sick of panicking
in every conversation I have

23:14.895 --> 23:16.897
just in case I use a word
in the wrong way,

23:16.980 --> 23:19.274
or in case someone asks me
where I went to university.

23:19.358 --> 23:21.777
-Come on. None of that stuff matters.
-It matters to me!

23:26.490 --> 23:30.827
These people, Jason,
they always see through me,

23:30.911 --> 23:32.788
and so will the social workers.

23:34.289 --> 23:35.707
Well, you know what?

23:36.792 --> 23:39.336
Screw 'em, hey? Screw 'em.

23:40.295 --> 23:42.214
They're no better than us.

23:42.297 --> 23:45.843
We're good people. We love each other.
We got good jobs.

23:46.969 --> 23:48.178
Yeah, right.

23:48.929 --> 23:54.560
There is a sign near my desk reminding me
to say my name when I answer the phone.

23:54.643 --> 23:57.688
We've got jobs that people get stuck in,
not jobs people choose.

23:57.771 --> 24:00.315
Look, I might not have
a fancy title and earn lots of money,

24:00.399 --> 24:02.025
but it's a good job, all right?

24:03.318 --> 24:07.072
And I work hard. I work really hard.
So, can we-- Look...

24:08.574 --> 24:13.787
Can we just go home? 'Cause, actually,
I'd love to just watch Avengers now.

24:14.246 --> 24:15.247
No.

24:16.081 --> 24:18.292
If you wanna go, go.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.085
But I'm gonna take this seriously.

24:20.169 --> 24:23.839
I am 33 and I want to take something
in my life seriously.

24:26.008 --> 24:28.594
And maybe if we'd taken
ourselves seriously earlier,

24:28.677 --> 24:32.347
we wouldn't both be stuck in jobs
that pay nothing and are really hard.

24:33.098 --> 24:33.932
Sorry.

25:16.225 --> 25:18.143
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, of course. Sorry, mate.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.788
-Cheers. Thank you.
-There you go. Enjoy your meal.

25:53.136 --> 25:55.430
Do you know that Steve Jobs
never went to university?

25:57.266 --> 25:58.517
Nor did Oprah Winfrey.

26:01.395 --> 26:04.565
Or, uh, Larry Ellison.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.277
-Who's Larry Ellison?
-No idea. But he never went to university.

26:12.281 --> 26:14.616
Is this supposed to be an apology?

26:15.534 --> 26:18.620
If you wanna go to more talks and stuff,
then we can do that, all right?

26:19.621 --> 26:22.708
-It's fine. It doesn't matter.
-No, no, really. I was actually--

26:23.542 --> 26:28.338
I was quite getting into it near the end.
There were some pretty interesting points.

26:29.006 --> 26:30.048
-Jason.
-Yeah.

26:30.132 --> 26:31.550
This isn't just about us anymore.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.468
We need to convince other people
that we're great.

26:33.552 --> 26:35.971
I know, Nikki, but the people
that we need to convince

26:36.054 --> 26:39.349
aren't the social workers
and the adoption panels or any of that.

26:39.433 --> 26:40.642
It's the kids.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.104
The kids are the ones
that have gotta love us.

26:44.188 --> 26:47.357
And you know who loves rubbish films

26:47.441 --> 26:50.110
and eating burgers
and hates learning stuff?

26:50.194 --> 26:51.195
Kids.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.324
We're gonna be their favorites.
They're all gonna wanna come home with us.

26:55.407 --> 26:58.994
We're gonna have to back the car up
and just start piling 'em in.

27:04.625 --> 27:06.168
You don't have to say all this.

27:06.877 --> 27:08.003
Who are they gonna prefer?

27:08.754 --> 27:15.427
People that make them go to museums
and art galleries, or people that do this?

27:18.096 --> 27:18.931
See?

27:20.265 --> 27:21.683
You got the mind of a child.

27:22.935 --> 27:24.394
They're gonna love you.

27:26.188 --> 27:27.397
And I love you.

27:28.899 --> 27:30.108
I love you.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.238
You're so ridiculous.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.160
It's all right.
They'll oeuvre it up later.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.330
Look, she loves it.

27:45.249 --> 27:46.750
Have I got something on my lip?

27:48.085 --> 27:49.419
You're so daft.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.645
What do you guys do?

28:06.728 --> 28:11.483
Well, it's taken a lot.
Started training and...

28:14.778 --> 28:16.780
-This one's ready.
-Okay.

28:16.864 --> 28:19.867
And then the two salads and...

28:23.036 --> 28:25.247
All right, gents. In the back!

28:25.789 --> 28:26.957
Sofia.
