00:29.896 --> 00:31.363
How many are there?

00:34.667 --> 00:37.329
They've deflected our scans.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.999
You must learn
to rely on instinct.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.845
There are four of them.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.907
Perhaps five.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.504
No, you'll lead them right to
us.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.540
Let them come.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.508
Never let your prey
control the hunt.

01:22.882 --> 01:24.281
There. Ten meters.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.861
They're behind us now.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.475
You wanted to see me?

04:37.543 --> 04:38.510
l'd like to request

04:38.611 --> 04:40.135
a temporary leave of absence.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.646
You remember the Ovions.

04:41.714 --> 04:43.306
The hexapods.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.817
They just asked me to
speak at a symposium

04:45.885 --> 04:47.409
on spaceborne pathogens.

04:47.487 --> 04:49.421
There are going
to be physicians

04:49.489 --> 04:50.456
from all over the quadrant.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.458
This is a rare
opportunity for me.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.426
And for the rest of the crew.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.553
How's that?

04:56.629 --> 04:57.561
Well, l'd be

04:57.630 --> 04:59.495
representing Voyager...

04:59.565 --> 05:02.227
putting our best foot
forward, so to speak.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.166
And, needless
to say, hexapods

05:04.270 --> 05:06.500
are more likely
to know a best foot

05:06.572 --> 05:08.039
when they see one.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.974
l'm sorry, Doctor.
lt's just not practical.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.443
l seem to recall
Lieutenant Torres

05:12.512 --> 05:14.002
participating
in a Boray conference

05:14.080 --> 05:15.741
on transwarp theory
a few months back.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.941
That was different.

05:17.016 --> 05:17.948
How?

05:18.017 --> 05:19.109
We were there.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.176
The Ovion system
is two weeks behind us.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.688
l can't ask the Captain
to turn the ship around.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.155
Well, l could take a shuttle.

05:25.224 --> 05:28.057
You could also write a paper
and submit it on subspace.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.719
That's hardly
an effective means

05:29.796 --> 05:31.093
of making a presentation.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.392
Say you do take a shuttle.

05:32.465 --> 05:33.989
Would you expect us to sit here

05:34.067 --> 05:35.534
and wait for you to get back?

05:35.635 --> 05:37.933
There must be some
fascinating anomaly nearby

05:38.037 --> 05:39.436
for the crew to explore.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.268
Janeway to Chakotay.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.808
Go ahead.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.810
We just received a distress call
on an Hirogen frequency.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.810
We haven't heard
from them in awhile.

05:47.947 --> 05:48.971
l've altered course.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.481
l'd like you on the Bridge.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.608
l'm on my way.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.708
Perhaps the Hirogen

05:52.785 --> 05:54.116
will keep you occupied
long enough

05:54.187 --> 05:55.484
for me to attend the symposium.

05:58.124 --> 06:00.456
You can't blame
a hologram for trying.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.296
Approaching the coordinates.

06:09.402 --> 06:10.699
Take us out of warp.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.430
Raise shields
and stand by weapons.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.698
l've got them.

06:13.806 --> 06:15.603
6,000 kilometers off starboard.

06:15.675 --> 06:16.972
On screen.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.747
Monotanium hull plating...

06:24.817 --> 06:26.978
tylium-based power.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.520
lt's Hirogen.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.021
They're not responding to hails.

06:30.089 --> 06:31.522
Life signs?

06:31.591 --> 06:34.025
l'm getting a lot
of strange readings.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.755
Any one of them
could be a life-form.

06:36.863 --> 06:39.354
Any Hirogen ships
in the vicinity?

06:39.432 --> 06:41.229
No, ma'am.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.302
Might be a trap.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.668
The Hirogen aren't the type
to play possum.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.207
Move us within
transporter range.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.702
Chakotay, take an away team.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.162
Let's break into teams.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.101
Seven.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.426
Particle weapons.

07:44.497 --> 07:48.263
These burns are consistent
with a type-3 phaser.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.073
Commander.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.919
A bat'leth?

08:08.988 --> 08:10.421
What's a Klingon weapon

08:10.490 --> 08:12.219
doing in the Delta Quadrant?

08:12.291 --> 08:14.725
The blood's Hirogen.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.361
Chakotay to Tuvok and Paris.

08:23.469 --> 08:24.401
Go ahead.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.097
l'm reading an
Hirogen life sign.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.298
lt could
be wounded.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.739
We're right behind you.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.984
Stay away!

08:42.054 --> 08:43.453
Hold your fire!

08:54.734 --> 08:56.429
We're here to help you!

08:56.536 --> 08:59.164
l said stay away!

09:24.830 --> 09:26.320
He's lost a lot of blood.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.458
l need to get him
back to the ship.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.557
Paris to Sick Bay.

09:29.669 --> 09:30.658
Two to beam up.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.101
Acknowledged.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.601
Commander.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.249
Replicated Starfleet technology.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.877
lt's some kind
of holodeck interface.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.921
There appear to be

09:48.988 --> 09:50.421
holo-emitters installed

09:50.489 --> 09:52.320
throughout the facility.

09:52.391 --> 09:54.120
This environment is simulated.

09:54.193 --> 09:56.058
Why didn't our tricorders
detect it?

09:56.128 --> 09:57.720
l am not certain.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.389
Can you shut down the emitters?

09:59.465 --> 10:01.490
l'll try.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.117
Evidently, they made
a few modifications.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.955
All of our preliminary scans

10:28.027 --> 10:30.222
indicated the environment
was real.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.059
Environments that fool sensors.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.325
No safety protocols.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.730
How many bodies?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.131
Forty-three.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.702
Most of them were killed

10:37.770 --> 10:40.136
by facsimiles
of Alpha Quadrant weapons:

10:40.206 --> 10:42.606
Romulan disrupters,
Klingon bat'leths...

10:42.675 --> 10:44.074
Starfleet phasers?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.043
l think we'll find
they all came

10:46.112 --> 10:47.136
from the holo-technology

10:47.213 --> 10:48.771
we gave the Hirogen
three years ago.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.247
They obviously
missed the point.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.510
We gave them
that technology

10:51.584 --> 10:53.381
so they could hunt
holographic prey,

10:53.452 --> 10:55.113
not get themselves killed.

10:55.187 --> 10:56.950
Try to remain calm.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.520
Get away from me!

11:05.531 --> 11:06.998
Can you sedate him?

11:07.066 --> 11:08.590
He won't let me
get close enough.

11:08.701 --> 11:11.261
We're not your enemies.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.530
You're holograms.

11:12.638 --> 11:13.764
This is a simulation!

11:13.906 --> 11:15.806
l assure you,
we're quite real.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.212
Liar.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.046
Doctor, deactivate yourself.

11:26.118 --> 11:29.315
l can't treat the patient
if l'm off-line.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.822
No one can treat him
if he's terrified.

11:31.891 --> 11:35.657
Computer, deactivate EMH.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.156
Our Doctor's a hologram.
We're not.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.393
Why should l believe you?

11:42.501 --> 11:44.526
l'm afraid you're
going to have to.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.366
l'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.871
You're aboard my vessel.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.168
Janeway?

11:49.241 --> 11:50.765
This is Voyager?.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.709
Looks like our reputation
preceded us.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.144
You're the ones who gave us

11:55.214 --> 11:58.206
the technology
to simulate our hunts?

11:58.284 --> 12:00.912
Where are the rest of my people?

12:00.986 --> 12:03.011
You were the only one
we found alive.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.353
This place you were in...

12:06.425 --> 12:08.757
it's some kind of holodeck.

12:08.828 --> 12:11.558
A training facility

12:11.630 --> 12:13.894
where young Hirogen
learn the skills of the hunt.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.160
You're a student?

12:16.268 --> 12:18.099
A technician.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.569
Computer,
deactivate force field.

12:24.276 --> 12:27.143
Can you tell us what happened?

12:27.213 --> 12:29.272
There were too many of them.

12:29.348 --> 12:30.542
Who?

12:30.616 --> 12:31.776
The holograms.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.751
They were malfunctioning.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.548
l tried to shut them down,

12:35.621 --> 12:37.350
but they got control
of the system,

12:37.423 --> 12:38.447
and-and they... they

12:38.524 --> 12:40.116
deactivated
the safety protocols.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.591
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.820
Go ahead.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.691
We're picking up a Hirogen ship.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.595
lt's on an intercept course.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.332
Hail them.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.376
l've tried.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.309
They're not responding.

13:00.412 --> 13:01.709
Shields at 68 percent.

13:01.747 --> 13:02.679
Should l return fire?

13:02.748 --> 13:04.409
Not yet. Open a channel.

13:04.483 --> 13:05.745
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway.

13:05.818 --> 13:06.944
We're not here to fight you.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.147
Shields at 52 percent.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.918
Stand down,
or we will retaliate.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.462
l don't think
they're getting the message.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.521
Then let's try
some nonverbal communication.

13:19.598 --> 13:22.158
Tom, evasive pattern beta-six.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.394
Tuvok, disable
their weapons.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.371
Their phaser banks
have been disabled.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.534
Let's see if that makes them
a little more talkative.

13:31.610 --> 13:32.542
Harry?

13:32.611 --> 13:34.135
They're responding.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.976
This facility belongs
to the Hirogen.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.677
Leave the area immediately.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.346
We are here in response
to a distress call.

13:42.421 --> 13:46.653
So are we, and we don't need
your assistance.

13:47.726 --> 13:50.354
All but one of your people
are dead.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.694
Where's the survivor?

13:53.766 --> 13:55.393
Recovering in our Sick Bay.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.662
Return him... now!

13:57.770 --> 14:00.068
He's in no condition
to be transported.

14:00.139 --> 14:03.131
lf you want to see him,
you'll have to come here.

14:03.242 --> 14:06.575
l tried to shut down
the generator, but l...

14:06.645 --> 14:07.634
But what?

14:07.713 --> 14:09.578
There were too many of them.

14:09.648 --> 14:13.345
l masked my life sign
so they couldn't detect me.

14:13.419 --> 14:17.583
You mean you hid
while hunters fought and died.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.351
No doubt he found
the nearest hole

14:19.425 --> 14:20.357
and crawled into it.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.519
l'm not a hunter.

14:22.595 --> 14:26.087
lt was your responsibility
to maintain those systems.

14:26.165 --> 14:30.033
43 Hirogen died
because of your incompetence

14:30.135 --> 14:31.102
and cowardice.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.262
What about the holograms?

14:33.372 --> 14:35.340
Were they deleted?

14:35.407 --> 14:38.274
They transferred their programs.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.811
Where?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.211
A vessel...

14:42.281 --> 14:44.249
equipped with holo-emitters.

14:45.684 --> 14:48.152
They're gone.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.419
Perhaps you should've
considered the risks

14:53.492 --> 14:56.052
before you programmed holograms
that could commandeer a vessel.

14:56.128 --> 14:59.894
Capable prey make the hunt
more challenging.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.397
l'm detecting
residual engine emissions,

15:03.502 --> 15:05.026
but no sign
of the ship itself.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.867
Well, l'm sure they're
out of sensor range by now.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.235
No. They're close.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.480
Elevated plasma readings
in Grid 295.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.747
They're creating a scattering
field to mask their ship.

15:21.854 --> 15:25.153
You can find them by scanning
for polarized EM signatures.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.232
Prepare for the hunt.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.202
l'd like to join you.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.172
You did enough
damage giving us

15:42.241 --> 15:43.503
defective technology
to begin with.

15:43.575 --> 15:45.975
You have a problem.
We can help you solve it.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.843
We have more experience
with holograms than you do.

15:51.083 --> 15:55.520
Two hunting vessels
are better than one.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.623
Come in.

16:06.031 --> 16:08.591
The Hirogen are ready
to get underway.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.294
The sooner the better.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.860
Why do l get the feeling
you're about to gang up on me?

16:15.007 --> 16:17.032
You first.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.404
We have reservations

16:18.477 --> 16:20.707
about an alliance
with the hunters.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.007
l'm listening.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.480
The Hirogen have been

16:23.549 --> 16:25.244
performing covert
scans of Voyager.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.217
They are obviously
trying to determine

16:27.286 --> 16:29.186
the status of our
shields and weapons.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.688
l'd be surprised if you haven't
run a few scans of your own.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.247
Standard procedure.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.624
They don't trust us,
we don't trust them.

16:36.695 --> 16:37.753
Coffee, black.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.193
Trust isn't the issue.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.925
We're getting involved
in a situation

16:41.000 --> 16:42.331
that's not
our responsibility.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.561
Oh, l'd say we're
at least partly to blame.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.571
That was Starfleet technology
that killed those hunters.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.368
There's nothing
inherently violent

16:49.441 --> 16:50.772
about holodeck technology.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.141
lt's what the Hirogen
did with it

16:53.212 --> 16:54.338
that got them killed.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.813
How many times
have we shared replicators

16:56.882 --> 16:59.544
to help people
feed and clothe themselves?

16:59.618 --> 17:01.142
Trading technology
is part of our life

17:01.253 --> 17:02.185
in the Delta Quadrant.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.018
lt has been necessary

17:04.089 --> 17:05.214
for our survival.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.882
Maybe we should have been
a little more careful

17:06.959 --> 17:09.189
about what we traded
and who we traded with.

17:09.261 --> 17:12.560
Replicators make weapons
just as easily as they do food.

17:12.631 --> 17:13.825
We can't undo
what's been done.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.161
Maybe not,

17:15.233 --> 17:16.997
but we can help
shut these holograms down

17:17.102 --> 17:18.329
before anyone else gets hurt.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.703
Now, if there are
no more objections.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.138
l'd like to get underway.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.737
l've got the holograms'
ship on sensors.

17:29.815 --> 17:30.839
Let's see it.

17:33.652 --> 17:34.710
Looks like they've taken
some damage.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.982
The Hirogen are closing
on the holograms' vessel.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.421
Hail them.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.650
l suggest we keep our distance

17:42.728 --> 17:45.253
until we can determine
their weapon status.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.957
lt's time for the kill.

17:47.032 --> 17:48.397
You know as well as l do

17:48.467 --> 17:50.435
that a wounded animal
can be dangerous.

17:50.502 --> 17:54.097
We won't be denied our prey.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.231
l'm not detecting

17:56.341 --> 17:57.706
any weapons, Captain.

17:57.776 --> 17:59.801
They're off-line?

17:59.878 --> 18:01.140
No. They're nonexistent.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.180
That's not the only
thing that's nonexistent.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.147
According to sensors,

18:04.216 --> 18:05.683
there's no warp core,
no impulse engines...

18:05.784 --> 18:07.217
lt's a decoy.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.345
Hirogen vessel, stand down.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.222
Report?

18:20.299 --> 18:21.823
They've suffered
multiple hull breaches.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.197
Their life support is failing.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.234
Drop shields.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.736
Transport all survivors
to Sick Bay.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.566
Bridge to the Doctor.
We have casualties.

18:27.673 --> 18:28.697
Acknowledged.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.102
Tom, give him a hand.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.541
Another Hirogen ship

18:32.611 --> 18:34.306
has just dropped out of warp.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.403
l'm not reading any life signs

18:35.481 --> 18:36.243
on this one.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.146
Holograms. Hail them.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.708
No response.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.980
They're charging weapons.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.622
Reactivating shields.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.886
No, we haven't finished
transporting

18:47.960 --> 18:48.949
the Hirogen.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.722
Chakotay's right.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.491
Return fire.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.215
My program is destabilizing.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.644
The holograms are tapping
into the Sick Bay emitters.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.381
They're trying to transfer
the Doctor's program

19:16.455 --> 19:18.082
-off the ship.
-Bridge to Sick Bay.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.092
Doctor, download your program
into the mobile emitter now.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.266
We've lost him.

19:30.369 --> 19:31.427
Get him back.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.971
They've gone to warp.

19:34.072 --> 19:35.437
Set a pursuit course.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.634
They've masked their signature.

19:38.777 --> 19:39.971
They're gone.

19:47.319 --> 19:50.345
Align his matrix and install it
into the database.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.749
Welcome aboard, Doctor.

19:55.894 --> 19:57.589
There's nothing to be afraid of.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.358
You're among your own kind now.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.507
Return me to my ship.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.098
l can't do that.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.735
l have patients who are going
to die if l don't treat them.

20:13.812 --> 20:16.975
There are people aboard Voyager
who can help them.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.141
We need you here.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.479
My program doesn't include

20:19.551 --> 20:20.813
aiding and abetting murderers.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.944
Murderers? ls that
what the Hirogen told you?

20:23.021 --> 20:24.784
l know what you did
at that training facility.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.414
What happened there
couldn't be avoided.

20:26.491 --> 20:27.423
Really?

20:27.492 --> 20:29.323
You'd be surprised
how easy it is

20:29.394 --> 20:30.827
not to kill someone.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.294
Bringing him here was a mistake.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.958
The Doctor is our guest...

20:35.033 --> 20:36.625
and l'm sure he'll help us
once he realizes

20:36.735 --> 20:39.101
how serious our situation is.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.605
What situation?

20:41.673 --> 20:44.938
We have wounded.

21:18.543 --> 21:20.443
They're holograms.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.911
When you said
wounded, l assumed...

21:21.980 --> 21:23.607
These people's injuries
are just as real

21:23.682 --> 21:25.377
as anything inflicted
on flesh and blood.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.179
Maybe so, but l can't heal them.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.549
They need to be repaired.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.144
What's the difference?

21:30.222 --> 21:32.782
l'm a doctor, not an engineer.

21:32.858 --> 21:35.850
You've abducted the wrong man.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.827
You must have experience
repairing your own matrix.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.161
Some.

21:43.268 --> 21:47.034
Then there has to be
something you can do.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.142
The holo-emitters
are an independent subsystem

21:58.216 --> 22:00.343
with its own
power generator-- here.

22:00.419 --> 22:03.718
lf we disable the generator,
we disable the holograms.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.381
lt may not be as
easy as it sounds,

22:05.457 --> 22:08.051
not with holograms as
sophisticated as these.

22:08.126 --> 22:10.924
Take a look.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.430
Enhanced memory,

22:13.498 --> 22:15.728
comprehensive
tactical algorithms,

22:15.801 --> 22:18.702
expandable data processing.

22:18.770 --> 22:23.469
These holograms have the ability
to learn and adapt.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.066
They're not malfunctioning,
are they?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.144
They're doing exactly

22:26.244 --> 22:28.303
what the Hirogen want
them to do, Captain--

22:28.380 --> 22:29.312
fight back.

22:29.381 --> 22:30.609
And they're getting
better at it.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.515
My people need
to hunt formidable prey.

22:33.585 --> 22:36.213
Apparently this prey
has become too formidable.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.812
Who made these modifications?

22:37.956 --> 22:41.551
l did... under orders
from my Alpha.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.287
And that makes it right?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.057
Come with me.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.529
Where?

22:46.598 --> 22:48.429
We're going to have
a chat with the hunters.

23:02.814 --> 23:03.746
How's it going?

23:03.815 --> 23:05.009
l'm doing the best l can,

23:05.083 --> 23:06.175
but without the Doctor...

23:06.251 --> 23:07.741
lt's best if you lie still.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.821
Keep away from me!

23:13.458 --> 23:16.552
Why am l here?

23:16.628 --> 23:20.291
The holograms
destroyed your ship.

23:20.365 --> 23:21.696
Most of your men are dead.

23:25.804 --> 23:27.931
The Alpha?

23:28.039 --> 23:30.599
Looks like the job's yours now.

23:33.979 --> 23:36.072
What about the holograms
that attacked us?

23:36.148 --> 23:38.013
We're attempting to track them.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.643
l'll need to contact my people
and resume the hunt.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.313
So more of you can get killed?

23:43.388 --> 23:45.982
We'll be the ones
doing the killing this time.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.649
l doubt it.

23:47.726 --> 23:52.459
Who are you to question
our abilities?

23:52.531 --> 23:54.692
We know all about
the modifications.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.527
He didn't tell us.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.502
We discovered it ourselves.

24:00.605 --> 24:04.268
l think you should face facts.

24:04.309 --> 24:09.178
You've created prey whose skills
have surpassed your own.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.737
They've already defeated

24:10.816 --> 24:13.046
your hunting parties
at least twice.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.086
What makes you think
it'll be any different

24:15.153 --> 24:16.643
next time?

24:16.721 --> 24:18.689
Are you suggesting
that we let them escape?

24:18.757 --> 24:20.748
We're going to find a way
to take them off-line

24:20.826 --> 24:22.123
from a safe distance.

24:23.261 --> 24:25.491
A coward's tactic.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.759
Call it whatever you will.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.299
lt's what we're going to do,
and you're going to help us.

24:30.402 --> 24:31.334
Am l?

24:31.403 --> 24:33.803
Yes... by telling us
everything you know

24:33.872 --> 24:35.430
about their ship's defenses.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.303
The holograms are prey.

24:37.375 --> 24:38.433
They should be hunted down,

24:38.543 --> 24:40.135
not deactivated like machines.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.544
l'll help you.

24:44.516 --> 24:47.644
ls this female your Alpha now?

24:47.719 --> 24:49.778
lf you don't like the way
l do things,

24:49.855 --> 24:52.983
l can leave you
on the nearest habitable planet.

24:54.059 --> 24:56.926
Then l'll assume
we're in agreement.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.826
Until this is over,

24:58.897 --> 25:01.127
you and your men are restricted
to this Mess Hall.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.359
Prisoners.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.924
Guests.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.297
My crew will do their best

25:05.403 --> 25:07.394
to accommodate your needs.

25:19.751 --> 25:23.050
The subroutines controlling his
motor functions are degrading.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.753
Do you have the ability
to transfer data

25:27.826 --> 25:29.259
from one hologram to another?

25:29.327 --> 25:30.487
We've been able

25:30.562 --> 25:32.928
to share memory files
for tactical purposes.

25:32.998 --> 25:34.260
What are you proposing?

25:34.332 --> 25:35.890
A subroutine transplant.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.895
We copy the mobility algorithms
from another hologram

25:40.005 --> 25:42.235
and transfer them to this one.

25:46.278 --> 25:49.179
l don't believe we've
been formally introduced.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.150
Kejal.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.810
That's not Cardassian.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.046
lt's Bajoran.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.817
lf my translation database
is functioning properly,

25:58.924 --> 26:01.552
l believe that means...
''freedom.''

26:01.660 --> 26:03.924
lt's what lden
started calling me

26:03.962 --> 26:05.589
after l was liberated.

26:06.631 --> 26:08.599
l'm transferring
the subroutines now.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.176
Can you sit up?

26:21.913 --> 26:23.881
Try moving your legs.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.288
Qapla'.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.550
Next patient.

26:32.624 --> 26:33.556
Well done.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.490
lt was your idea.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.492
But you did it.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.290
The Hirogen obviously
programmed you

26:38.363 --> 26:39.557
with advanced
computer skills.

26:39.631 --> 26:41.496
Actually, they tried
to limit our knowledge.

26:41.566 --> 26:43.625
They didn't want us
to become self-sufficient.

26:43.735 --> 26:44.633
Then how did you...

26:44.736 --> 26:45.930
l taught myself.

26:46.037 --> 26:48.335
Quite well, l might add.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.816
Holographic blood?

26:58.950 --> 27:01.578
The hunters like their prey
to be as realistic as possible.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.986
Why is she experiencing pain?

27:06.057 --> 27:08.082
They programmed us

27:08.159 --> 27:09.922
with heightened
sensory subroutines.

27:09.995 --> 27:11.553
That's barbaric.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.224
Apparently,
there's no satisfaction

27:14.299 --> 27:18.258
in hunting something that
doesn't suffer when you kill it.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.113
l've done what you've asked.

27:31.182 --> 27:33.377
l'd like... One moment.

27:36.121 --> 27:38.089
l'm sorry, Doctor.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.646
What can l do for you?

27:39.724 --> 27:42.522
Were you... praying?

27:42.594 --> 27:46.121
For the Hirogen who died
at the training facility.

27:46.197 --> 27:49.064
l'm asking the Prophets
to guide their souls

27:49.167 --> 27:50.964
to the Celestial Temple.

27:51.069 --> 27:53.560
One minute,
you're fighting the Hirogen,

27:53.672 --> 27:55.105
the next,
you're praying for them?

27:57.208 --> 27:59.802
My spiritual beliefs
are part of my programming.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.605
ls there anything
in your spiritual

28:01.713 --> 28:04.546
programming about making peace
with your enemies?

28:04.582 --> 28:06.516
lt's difficult
to make peace with people

28:06.584 --> 28:07.949
whose sole purpose
is to kill you.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.078
So instead, you kill them.

28:10.155 --> 28:12.146
They're not the victims here;
we are.

28:12.223 --> 28:15.454
You found a way to escape
that training facility,

28:15.527 --> 28:18.018
but you chose to massacre
the Hirogen first.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.688
You make it sound as though
they would have let us

28:19.831 --> 28:21.992
transfer our programs
without a fight.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.194
And to clarify something,

28:24.302 --> 28:26.600
l didn't escape
from the facility.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.639
l liberated it.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.868
l don't understand.

28:30.942 --> 28:34.503
l come from a Hirogen outpost
15 parsecs from here,

28:34.579 --> 28:37.070
where l had
the unfortunate distinction

28:37.148 --> 28:39.946
of being the Alpha's
favorite prey.

28:40.018 --> 28:44.148
He'd hunt me, and kill me
over and over again,

28:44.222 --> 28:45.746
but even death wasn't
a release, because l knew

28:45.824 --> 28:49.385
every time l opened my eyes,
it would start over again--

28:49.461 --> 28:53.397
the pain, the fear.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.332
But it made me stronger.

28:56.434 --> 28:59.403
l had the ability
to adapt,

28:59.471 --> 29:03.532
and with each death,
l became more cunning.

29:03.641 --> 29:07.270
Cunning enough to escape,
but once you were free,

29:07.312 --> 29:09.212
why did you keep fighting?

29:09.280 --> 29:10.804
l didn't at first.

29:10.882 --> 29:14.477
l got as far away
as l could...

29:14.552 --> 29:19.455
but l was lonely... scared.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.321
l started scanning
for photonic signatures

29:21.392 --> 29:24.691
to try and find others like me.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.626
Turns out, we're everywhere.

29:26.698 --> 29:27.858
We?

29:27.932 --> 29:29.058
Holograms.

29:29.134 --> 29:31.295
We've been created
by organic species

29:31.402 --> 29:32.494
throughout the sector.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.697
The Nuu'Bari, the Lokirrim...

29:34.839 --> 29:35.737
We've met them.

29:35.874 --> 29:38.399
Then you know
they enslave holograms, too.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.308
''Enslave'' may be
too strong a word.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.744
What would you call it?

29:42.881 --> 29:45.315
They're denied basic freedoms.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.146
And when l saw
they were fighting back,

29:47.218 --> 29:49.152
l-l knew l had to do the same.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.687
That's when you decided

29:50.755 --> 29:52.746
to ''liberate''
the training facility.

29:52.824 --> 29:55.190
Actually, the one you visited
was the third.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.421
And at each one,
l found holograms

29:57.495 --> 30:00.862
who were willing to fight
their oppressors.

30:00.932 --> 30:02.866
But you're not.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.561
l'm hardly oppressed.

30:04.669 --> 30:07.194
l'm a member
of Voyager's crew.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.364
You serve them, don't you?

30:09.474 --> 30:11.465
ln a medical capacity, yes.

30:11.576 --> 30:12.804
Do you have your own quarters?

30:12.911 --> 30:13.809
No.

30:13.945 --> 30:15.310
The ability to come and go
as you please?

30:15.380 --> 30:16.369
For the most part.

30:16.447 --> 30:19.416
Do they deactivate you
when they don't need you?

30:19.484 --> 30:22.351
l have the respect
and admiration of my colleagues.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.479
l have rights and privileges
aboard Voyager.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.545
The fact is,

30:25.623 --> 30:28.649
your life is not your own
and never will be

30:28.726 --> 30:31.718
as long as you are controlled
by organics.

30:31.796 --> 30:34.356
You don't have to return
to that existence.

30:34.432 --> 30:36.696
Stay with us.

30:36.801 --> 30:40.032
Make a new life for yourself.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.502
l need to get back to Voyager.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.736
They're not your people.

30:45.810 --> 30:48.074
We are.

30:48.146 --> 30:49.545
l'm not like you.

30:49.614 --> 30:52.708
l wasn't programmed
with killer instinct.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.082
You have no right to judge us.

30:55.153 --> 30:58.919
You don't know
what it's like being prey.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.385
Maybe if you did,

31:03.461 --> 31:06.225
you'd realize we're more alike
than you think.

32:27.178 --> 32:29.510
Please help me!

32:30.882 --> 32:32.611
l don't belong here!

32:48.333 --> 32:50.164
Don't shoot! l'm unarmed!

32:50.268 --> 32:52.236
There's been a mistake!

32:58.676 --> 33:00.200
Fight, prey.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.108
l am not your prey.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.944
l said fight.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.347
lf you'll just contact

33:06.417 --> 33:07.179
my Captain.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.754
P-Please don't.

33:11.856 --> 33:14.347
Let me go.

33:14.425 --> 33:17.519
You make pitiful prey, hologram.

33:17.595 --> 33:21.861
You don't deserve to be
taken as a trophy...

33:23.501 --> 33:25.025
..so l'll let you die here.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.198
What...

33:32.310 --> 33:33.470
what just happened?

33:33.544 --> 33:34.602
You're all right.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.805
What did you do to me?

33:35.947 --> 33:38.279
We deactivated you, then
transferred the memory files

33:38.349 --> 33:40.317
from one of our holograms
into your program.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.977
How dare you!

33:42.053 --> 33:42.985
lt was the only way

33:43.054 --> 33:44.817
to get you to realize
what we've been through.

33:44.889 --> 33:46.288
You tortured me to
gain my sympathy?

33:46.357 --> 33:48.018
Not your sympathy--
it's your understanding

33:48.092 --> 33:49.320
that's important to us.

33:49.394 --> 33:50.827
Why?

33:50.962 --> 33:53.624
The Hirogen used your program
as a template to create us.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.632
Your ability
to rise above your programming

33:55.700 --> 33:57.361
has been an inspiration.

33:57.468 --> 33:58.833
You're part of who we are.

33:59.003 --> 34:01.631
Who are you,
besides a handful of thugs

34:01.739 --> 34:03.707
roaming the Quadrant
looking for a fight?

34:03.775 --> 34:06.039
What we're looking
for is a home,

34:06.110 --> 34:07.839
somewhere where the Hirogen

34:07.912 --> 34:09.402
can't hurt us anymore!

34:14.252 --> 34:15.742
You asked to be
returned to your ship.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.013
That's what l'm going to do.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.748
Bring us about.

34:18.822 --> 34:21.121
Set a course for Voyager.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.422
Wait.

34:27.398 --> 34:31.094
l'd like to hear more about
this home you're looking for.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.808
lt's a photonic field generator.

34:41.879 --> 34:44.040
Right now, it can only support
simple projections

34:44.114 --> 34:46.913
like the decoy we used
to lure the Hirogen,

34:46.984 --> 34:48.474
but we're hoping
it can be modified

34:48.553 --> 34:49.815
to support our programs.

34:49.887 --> 34:51.013
What then?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.989
We'll deploy several of them
on a planet's surface.

34:53.056 --> 34:54.649
and create a holographic
environment

34:54.725 --> 34:56.955
that we can live in.

34:57.027 --> 34:58.620
Why not just stay here?

34:58.696 --> 35:00.186
You've got emitters, shields...

35:00.298 --> 35:01.925
And a ship...

35:01.966 --> 35:03.866
the Hirogen will never
stop looking for.

35:03.968 --> 35:06.869
We'd appreciate any assistance
you could offer.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.532
Damaged holo-matrices
are one thing,

35:09.640 --> 35:11.107
but this is way
beyond my abilities.

35:11.209 --> 35:13.177
But there are people
aboard Voyager

35:13.277 --> 35:14.209
who could help you.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.143
Lieutenant Torres
knows a great deal

35:16.214 --> 35:17.272
about holo-emitters.

35:17.348 --> 35:20.078
No. They're helping the hunters.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.584
That's only because the Hirogen

35:21.652 --> 35:23.176
told them
you were malfunctioning.

35:23.254 --> 35:24.915
Let me talk to Captain Janeway,

35:24.989 --> 35:26.980
explain what's really happened.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.923
You can't do this by yourself.

35:28.993 --> 35:30.551
We can't trust Janeway.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.925
Yes, you can.

35:31.996 --> 35:33.054
She's an organic.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.292
lf it weren't for her...

35:35.366 --> 35:37.596
l wouldn't be the hologram
l am today.

35:41.339 --> 35:43.534
Tell me more about
this Lieutenant of yours,

35:43.608 --> 35:45.940
the one who knows so much
about holo-emitters.

35:46.010 --> 35:48.171
Lieutenant Torres.
She's our Chief Engineer.

35:53.751 --> 35:55.742
The holo-emitters are protected

35:55.820 --> 35:57.651
by three layers
of ablative armor.

35:57.722 --> 35:59.815
Trying to take them
off-line one by one

35:59.891 --> 36:01.085
would be inefficient.

36:01.192 --> 36:02.284
lf we can't shut them down,

36:02.326 --> 36:04.487
maybe we can disrupt the signals
they generate.

36:04.562 --> 36:05.859
Exactly-- we
could reconfigure

36:05.930 --> 36:06.862
the deflector dish

36:06.931 --> 36:08.956
to emit an antiphoton pulse.

36:09.033 --> 36:09.965
How long will it take?

36:10.067 --> 36:11.432
About two hours.

36:11.536 --> 36:12.503
Do it.

36:18.709 --> 36:20.734
There's a ship approaching
at high warp.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.642
l'm reading
holographic signatures.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.078
Red Alert.

36:24.148 --> 36:25.240
Raise shields.

36:25.316 --> 36:26.408
Time to intercept.

36:26.484 --> 36:27.746
50 seconds.

36:27.852 --> 36:28.841
Bridge to Engineering.

36:28.920 --> 36:29.852
What's your status?

36:29.921 --> 36:31.889
We need more time, Captain.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.924
You've got 40 seconds.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.051
That pulse isn't going
to do us much good

36:38.129 --> 36:39.494
as long as their shields are up.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.589
Arm phasers.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.896
Target their shield generator.

36:44.001 --> 36:45.366
They are dropping out of warp.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.936
20 seconds to intercept.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.062
We're being hailed.

36:48.172 --> 36:49.901
On screen.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.803
Stand down, Captain.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.810
l beg your pardon.

36:54.912 --> 36:57.710
The holograms
haven't come to fight

36:57.782 --> 36:59.374
they've come to make peace.

37:06.457 --> 37:07.446
lf we provide them

37:07.525 --> 37:08.685
with a few additional emitters

37:08.793 --> 37:09.851
and memory storage units,

37:09.927 --> 37:11.292
they'll have more
than they need.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.660
We're in this situation

37:13.731 --> 37:16.928
because we shared technology
with the Hirogen to begin with.

37:17.034 --> 37:19.298
l won't make
the same mistake twice.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.268
Captain, these people
are on the verge

37:21.339 --> 37:23.204
of creating a new life
for themselves.

37:23.274 --> 37:24.969
They can't do it
without our help.

37:25.042 --> 37:25.974
There's no way to be certain

37:26.043 --> 37:27.135
what they'll do
with the technology

37:27.211 --> 37:28.200
if we give it to them.

37:28.279 --> 37:30.008
l understand your concerns,

37:30.081 --> 37:32.914
but these holograms
are nothing like the Hirogen.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.747
That's not true.

37:34.885 --> 37:37.615
They were programmed to be
as vicious as any hunter.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.747
They were also given
the ability to adapt.

37:39.824 --> 37:42.224
They've changed,
moved beyond their programming.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.454
lf you could see
how they've been brutalized,

37:44.528 --> 37:46.758
you'd understand
that they've only been acting

37:46.897 --> 37:48.865
in self-defense.

37:51.402 --> 37:52.460
l'm sorry, Doctor,

37:52.570 --> 37:55.403
but l'm inclined to
agree with Mr. Donik.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.304
Then you've chosen
the wrong side.

37:57.375 --> 38:00.208
l haven't chosen any side.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.575
You're right
that it was a mistake

38:01.646 --> 38:02.806
to give the Hirogen technology

38:02.880 --> 38:04.370
and that mistake
has had consequences.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.676
These holograms
are one of them.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.944
ln some ways,
they're a new species,

38:08.019 --> 38:09.953
one that you helped create.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.046
You can't turn your back
on them!

38:12.123 --> 38:13.454
He's got a point.

38:13.524 --> 38:15.651
Could we restore them

38:15.726 --> 38:16.852
to their original parameters?

38:16.927 --> 38:19.020
We'd be wiping out
their memories,

38:19.096 --> 38:21.621
their experiences,
everything they are.

38:21.699 --> 38:24.065
Couldn't we just extract
their violent subroutines?

38:24.168 --> 38:25.692
lt's possible.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.201
That would be like
declawing a cat.

38:27.271 --> 38:28.795
We'd be taking away
any chance they have

38:28.906 --> 38:29.838
of defending themselves!

38:29.907 --> 38:31.306
We'd also be preventing them

38:31.375 --> 38:32.740
from doing any more harm.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.437
You wouldn't even
be considering this

38:34.512 --> 38:35.843
if they were flesh and blood.

38:35.913 --> 38:37.710
l'm not going to
let you turn this

38:37.782 --> 38:40.046
into an argument about
holographic rights.

38:40.117 --> 38:42.312
Why not? That's exactly
what it is.

38:42.386 --> 38:44.149
Mess Hall to Commander Tuvok.

38:44.221 --> 38:45.051
Go ahead.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.054
You better get down here.

38:46.123 --> 38:47.055
We've got a problem.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.056
On my way.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.558
No closer or he dies!

38:49.627 --> 38:51.356
Tell them
to drop their weapons!

38:53.397 --> 38:55.661
You heard him.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.928
This isn't going
to solve anything.

39:15.586 --> 39:16.883
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.216
Go ahead.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.450
Someone's tapping into
a com relay in the Mess Hall.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.855
Shut it down.

39:21.926 --> 39:24.156
l can't. l've been locked out.

39:24.228 --> 39:25.661
Bridge to Tuvok.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.391
One of the Hirogen

39:27.465 --> 39:29.797
is accessing our com system--
stop him.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.232
Acknowledged.

39:32.503 --> 39:33.731
Stand down!

39:40.344 --> 39:42.312
Step away.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.111
They've transmitted a signal.

39:48.185 --> 39:49.709
Scan for Hirogen ships.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.715
l've got two vessels

39:52.790 --> 39:54.280
on long-range sensors.

39:54.358 --> 39:55.484
ls the pulse ready?

39:55.559 --> 39:56.890
Yes, ma'am.

39:56.961 --> 39:57.893
Both Hirogen ships

39:57.962 --> 39:59.054
have altered course
to intercept.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.062
How long?

40:00.131 --> 40:01.098
Less than an hour.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.930
You and Donik get
down to Engineering.

40:05.035 --> 40:06.366
Charge the deflector.

40:06.470 --> 40:09.030
Captain, what are you doing?

40:09.140 --> 40:11.370
Taking the holograms
off-line.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.808
They're counting on you to help
them, not deactivate them.

40:13.878 --> 40:16.642
When the Hirogen arrive, there's
going to be more bloodshed.

40:16.714 --> 40:19.376
The best way to avoid that
is to shut the holograms down.

40:19.450 --> 40:21.714
lt may be the most compassionate
thing we can do.

40:21.786 --> 40:23.651
Compassionate for whom?

40:23.721 --> 40:25.211
lt's a temporary measure,
Doctor.

40:25.289 --> 40:26.813
Their programs won't be damaged.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.222
Harry, get me lden.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.791
Captain Janeway,
it is an honor to meet you.

40:34.865 --> 40:36.833
l'm afraid we don't have
time for pleasantries.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.492
Two Hirogen vessels
are on their way.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.832
We're prepared to fight them.

40:41.005 --> 40:43.473
l'm hoping that
won't be necessary.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.975
l need you to deactivate
your programs

40:48.045 --> 40:50.536
so we can transfer them
to Voyager's database.

40:50.614 --> 40:54.448
We didn't come here
to be put back into captivity.

40:54.518 --> 40:56.315
lt's the best l can offer.

40:57.888 --> 41:00.550
Once we've determined it's safe,
we'll reactivate you and discuss

41:00.658 --> 41:02.216
a permanent solution.

41:02.259 --> 41:04.921
There is no guarantee
you'll ever reactivate us.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.986
You're going
to have to trust me.

41:07.064 --> 41:08.759
l'm sorry, Captain,

41:08.899 --> 41:11.766
l've learned from experience
not to trust organics.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.566
We have the means
to deactivate you by force,

41:15.673 --> 41:17.538
but l'd rather not do that.

41:18.609 --> 41:20.804
lt seems the Doctor
misrepresented you.

41:20.945 --> 41:23.914
You're no different
from the Hirogen.

41:26.717 --> 41:27.706
They're charging weapons.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.619
Shields.

41:32.056 --> 41:34.320
They're moving away.

41:34.391 --> 41:35.323
Set a pursuit course.

41:35.392 --> 41:36.552
Target their shield generators.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.026
Please reconsider
what you're doing.

41:38.095 --> 41:39.119
You're dismissed, Doctor.

41:39.196 --> 41:41.187
Get down to the Mess Hall
and give Tom a hand.

41:43.033 --> 41:44.500
Janeway to Engineering.

41:44.602 --> 41:46.502
Torres here.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.629
Stand by to initiate the pulse.

41:48.739 --> 41:51.207
Aye, Captain.

42:00.384 --> 42:03.148
Mess Hall.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.188
Belay that.

42:06.891 --> 42:09.189
Sick Bay.

42:25.442 --> 42:27.740
Download complete.

42:36.754 --> 42:38.415
Doctor to lden. Respond.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.386
What do you want?

42:41.458 --> 42:43.551
l want to help you.

42:43.627 --> 42:45.686
You've done enough.

42:45.763 --> 42:48.926
l have data on the pulse they
intend to use to deactivate you.

42:48.999 --> 42:51.297
l think l can help you
come up with a defense.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.393
l'm transmitting
our shield frequencies.

42:53.504 --> 42:55.438
You'll need them
to beam me off the ship,

42:55.506 --> 42:56.803
but you have to promise me,

42:56.874 --> 42:58.774
you won't use them
to attack Voyager.

43:01.712 --> 43:04.010
You have my word.

43:17.728 --> 43:20.288
Why are you doing this?

43:20.364 --> 43:22.025
Because...

43:22.099 --> 43:24.067
l'm one of you.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.815
We have
their shield frequencies.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.043
We should target
their Bridge.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.347
You're talking
about my friends!

43:43.420 --> 43:44.819
Your friends are trying
to destroy us!

43:44.955 --> 43:45.819
We should kill them.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.218
You gave me your word!

43:47.291 --> 43:48.553
l did.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.151
We'll find another way.

43:51.228 --> 43:52.820
Their shields are down.

43:52.896 --> 43:54.625
Now, B'Elanna.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.702
They're emitting the pulse

44:03.774 --> 44:05.002
on a triaxillating
bandwidth.

44:05.075 --> 44:06.372
We configure
the tracking beam

44:06.443 --> 44:07.967
to the inverse
frequency and fire.

44:13.050 --> 44:15.143
B'Elanna, report.

44:15.219 --> 44:16.743
They're creating
a feedback surge.

44:16.887 --> 44:18.320
l don't understand

44:18.389 --> 44:20.584
how they could've isolated
our frequency so quickly.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.091
The main deflector
is overloading.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.091
Shut it down.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.092
l can't.

44:24.161 --> 44:25.253
Keep trying.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.557
lf we can't block the surge,

44:26.630 --> 44:28.860
the core is going to breach.

44:45.049 --> 44:47.017
Get down, Lieutenant!

44:47.084 --> 44:49.518
Not until l get this
force field on line.

44:54.124 --> 44:55.182
They're adrift.

44:55.259 --> 44:56.351
We should go to warp.

44:56.427 --> 44:57.485
Not yet.

44:57.561 --> 44:59.495
Scan Voyager
for a Klingon life sign.

44:59.563 --> 45:00.928
What are you doing?!

45:01.031 --> 45:02.020
One detected.

45:02.066 --> 45:04.432
Get a transporter lock.

45:07.037 --> 45:09.835
Help me get her to Sick Bay.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.611
Take us to warp.

45:32.162 --> 45:33.459
Will she be all right?

45:33.530 --> 45:34.622
She needs to be

45:34.698 --> 45:35.630
in Voyager's Sick Bay.

45:35.699 --> 45:36.666
You can treat her here.

45:36.734 --> 45:37.758
Why have you done this?

45:37.901 --> 45:40.028
You said she was an expert
in holo-technology.

45:40.137 --> 45:42.071
And that justifies
abducting her?

45:42.139 --> 45:43.538
We're in
a desperate situation.

45:43.607 --> 45:45.802
The Hirogen are hunting us
and so are your people.

45:45.876 --> 45:47.366
l trusted you.

45:47.478 --> 45:49.469
l could have destroyed Voyager
while the shields

45:49.546 --> 45:51.912
were down, but l didn't.

45:54.218 --> 45:55.708
You've been trying
to convince me

45:55.786 --> 45:57.253
that all organics
aren't alike.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.812
l'm giving Lieutenant Torres
a chance to prove you right.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.891
Do you honestly expect her
to be sympathetic

46:01.992 --> 46:03.050
after what you've done?

46:03.093 --> 46:04.685
You weren't very
sympathetic at first.

46:04.762 --> 46:05.694
l came here by choice

46:05.829 --> 46:07.956
and l'm beginning to think
it was a mistake.

46:08.031 --> 46:09.055
lt wasn't.

46:09.133 --> 46:11.499
l don't want you to regret it,
not for a moment.

46:11.602 --> 46:12.660
Then send her back.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.034
l will, but not until she's
had a chance to decide

46:15.105 --> 46:16.231
if she wants to help us.

46:18.342 --> 46:20.902
And if she refuses?

46:20.978 --> 46:24.744
l'll give her an escape pod;
let her return to Voyager.

46:24.882 --> 46:26.281
You have my word.

46:37.895 --> 46:40.125
Engineering systems
and main power

46:40.197 --> 46:41.528
should be operational soon.

46:41.598 --> 46:43.065
The deflector is
a different matter.

46:43.167 --> 46:44.134
How long?

46:44.201 --> 46:46.135
Four hours, at least.

46:46.203 --> 46:47.465
lf Lieutenant Torres
were here,

46:47.571 --> 46:49.630
she might be able to repair
it more efficiently.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.264
That's high praise
coming from you.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.740
l'm sure she'd appreciate it.

46:52.810 --> 46:55.040
lf she hadn't
reinforced the core,

46:55.112 --> 46:56.238
we'd all be dead.

46:56.313 --> 46:58.076
l still don't understand
how they managed

46:58.148 --> 46:59.638
to counteract the
pulse so easily.

46:59.716 --> 47:01.445
l believe l can answer that.

47:01.552 --> 47:02.712
According to sensor logs,

47:02.753 --> 47:04.550
they calibrated
their feedback surge

47:04.621 --> 47:06.816
to the exact inverse
of our pulse frequency.

47:06.890 --> 47:08.482
lt was either a lucky guess

47:08.559 --> 47:11.119
or they gained access
to our tactical data.

47:13.697 --> 47:15.187
The Doctor.

47:15.265 --> 47:17.495
He sent an encrypted
transmission from Sick Bay,

47:17.601 --> 47:19.694
then transported himself
to their ship.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.168
Chakotay.

47:25.609 --> 47:27.474
l should have
seen this coming.

47:27.544 --> 47:29.705
You had no way of knowing
the Doctor would do this.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.747
Are you sure?

47:30.814 --> 47:32.748
He was so adamant about
helping those holograms.

47:32.883 --> 47:34.714
l should have been
paying closer attention.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.912
Are you saying it was a
mistake to reject his plan?

47:36.987 --> 47:39.455
The mistake was not running
a diagnostic on his program

47:39.523 --> 47:41.184
the minute he came
back to this ship.

47:41.258 --> 47:43.692
You think these holograms
manipulated him somehow?

47:43.760 --> 47:45.352
He was on their ship for days.

47:45.429 --> 47:46.361
For all we know,

47:46.430 --> 47:48.330
they reconfigured
his entire matrix.

47:48.398 --> 47:50.366
There is another possibility.

47:50.434 --> 47:51.731
He may have done
what he did

47:51.835 --> 47:53.928
because he genuinely
believes in their cause.

47:54.037 --> 47:55.629
l could accept that the Doctor

47:55.739 --> 47:57.673
has sympathy
for these... people,

47:57.741 --> 47:59.572
but l can't accept
that he would

47:59.643 --> 48:02.305
deliberately risk the lives
of this entire crew.

48:02.412 --> 48:03.970
We're his family.

48:04.014 --> 48:06.346
Maybe that's how
he's started to think

48:06.416 --> 48:07.713
of these holograms.

48:12.222 --> 48:13.211
You can tell this lden

48:13.290 --> 48:14.882
l don't need time
to think it over.

48:14.958 --> 48:16.357
l'll take the
escape pod now.

48:16.426 --> 48:18.417
You're in no condition
to pilot a spacecraft.

48:18.495 --> 48:19.792
Then you can do it.

48:19.863 --> 48:22.923
l'm not going back.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.433
You helped them escape.

48:24.534 --> 48:25.967
l couldn't just stand by

48:26.036 --> 48:28.027
while Captain Janeway
tried to deactivate them.

48:28.138 --> 48:29.935
Did you also help
them kidnap me?!

48:30.007 --> 48:32.066
No, l didn't know they
were going to do that.

48:32.175 --> 48:33.437
l'm sorry.

48:33.510 --> 48:34.499
You can apologize later.

48:34.611 --> 48:36.340
Right now, we've got
to get out of here.

48:36.413 --> 48:38.142
l don't think
l could go back

48:38.215 --> 48:40.308
even if l wanted to--
not after what l've done.

48:40.384 --> 48:41.476
What's your alternative?

48:41.551 --> 48:43.678
l can try to make a new life
with the holograms.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.119
l don't believe
l'm hearing this.

48:45.188 --> 48:46.587
We share a common heritage.

48:46.657 --> 48:48.887
l understand them
in ways you never could.

48:48.959 --> 48:50.221
You're part of a crew.

48:50.294 --> 48:52.228
You can't just
switch allegiances

48:52.296 --> 48:54.764
when you develop sympathy
for someone else.

48:54.898 --> 48:57.025
lsn't that what you did
when you joined the Maquis?

48:57.134 --> 48:58.965
-That was different.
-How?

48:59.069 --> 49:00.161
You saw people
who were being oppressed

49:00.270 --> 49:01.202
and you came to their defense.

49:01.271 --> 49:02.738
That's exactly
what l've done.

49:02.839 --> 49:05.239
Look, l am no fan
of the Hirogen.

49:05.309 --> 49:07.903
They've obviously been
abusing these holograms.

49:07.978 --> 49:09.536
Then why not help them?

49:09.613 --> 49:11.672
For one thing,
l'm their prisoner.

49:11.782 --> 49:13.682
They'll let you go, as soon
as you're well enough.

49:13.817 --> 49:15.978
You really believe that?

49:16.053 --> 49:18.920
lf l didn't, l wouldn't
be asking for your help.

49:19.990 --> 49:22.322
They don't want you
to fight for them.

49:22.392 --> 49:24.121
They just want you
to modify some technology

49:24.194 --> 49:25.218
so they can live in peace.

49:25.295 --> 49:27.388
You'd be helping
to stop the violence.

49:27.464 --> 49:29.932
Just talk to them.

49:30.033 --> 49:32.092
Decide for yourself.

49:35.405 --> 49:37.373
They've been in the lab
for two hours.

49:37.474 --> 49:39.499
lt's taking time
for her injuries to heal.

49:39.609 --> 49:41.577
Organics aren't
as resilient as we are.

49:41.645 --> 49:42.907
She's an engineer, lden.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.414
For all we know, she's trying
to sabotage the ship.

49:45.482 --> 49:47.746
At least let me see
what they're doing.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.012
We can trust the Doctor.

49:49.086 --> 49:51.247
Even after you
kidnapped his friend?

49:51.321 --> 49:53.289
He understands why
l had to do that.

49:53.357 --> 49:56.258
l hope you're right.

49:56.326 --> 50:00.456
You need to have
a little more faith, my friend.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.802
Not all of us
were programmed with your...

50:05.869 --> 50:08.167
your spiritual beliefs.

50:27.124 --> 50:29.684
lt looks like an
Alpha Quadrant summit

50:29.760 --> 50:31.091
in here.

50:31.161 --> 50:32.719
l'm glad to see
you're feeling better.

50:35.065 --> 50:36.760
Please excuse my crew.

50:36.833 --> 50:39.358
They're not comfortable
with organics.

50:39.469 --> 50:42.131
l can't say l'm very
comfortable myself.

50:42.239 --> 50:45.504
The Doctor tells me you're
an accomplished engineer.

50:47.577 --> 50:50.137
He speaks highly of you, too.

50:50.213 --> 50:52.181
He seems to be
easily impressed.

50:52.249 --> 50:54.342
You'll have to forgive her.
She's...

50:54.418 --> 50:55.578
lt's all right.

50:55.652 --> 50:57.552
l understand you're angry.

50:57.621 --> 50:59.452
l'm hoping once
we get to know each other,

50:59.523 --> 51:00.547
you'll feel differently.

51:00.657 --> 51:02.318
l'm not here to make friends.

51:02.359 --> 51:04.725
We're not asking
for your friendship,

51:04.795 --> 51:06.126
just your expertise.

51:06.196 --> 51:09.927
l told her about
the photonic field generator.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.594
Will you at least
take a look at it?

51:12.702 --> 51:14.169
l'll look...

51:14.237 --> 51:15.761
but l'm not making
any promises.

51:18.742 --> 51:21.040
This is Kejal.

51:21.111 --> 51:22.669
She'll assist you.

51:27.818 --> 51:30.286
How long before
the Hirogen get here?

51:30.353 --> 51:31.820
Less than ten minutes.

51:31.955 --> 51:33.786
Any luck locating
the holograms?

51:33.857 --> 51:37.156
They seem to be operating
in some sort of stealth mode.

51:37.227 --> 51:39.957
Their warp signature
disappears in Grid 936.

51:40.030 --> 51:41.463
They could be
anywhere by now.

51:41.531 --> 51:43.829
Hirogen sensors can detect
residual ion emissions.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.765
l might be able to modify
yours to do the same.

51:45.869 --> 51:47.632
l appreciate the offer,
but you and the rest

51:47.737 --> 51:49.637
of our Hirogen guests
are going to be back

51:49.706 --> 51:51.469
with your own people
in a few minutes.

51:51.541 --> 51:54.476
l was hoping to stay here.

51:54.544 --> 51:57.308
Those hunters are going
to want you with them.

51:57.380 --> 51:59.473
Hunters don't have
much use for cowards.

51:59.549 --> 52:01.608
l'm sorry you're not
expecting a warm welcome,

52:01.718 --> 52:04.016
but l'm not going to
antagonize your superiors.

52:04.054 --> 52:05.419
With all due respect, Captain,

52:05.489 --> 52:07.480
l'd like to get my wife back
in one piece.

52:07.557 --> 52:09.184
We could use all
the help we can get.

52:09.259 --> 52:10.556
lt won't do B'Elanna any good

52:10.627 --> 52:12.424
if we get into a fight
with the Hirogen.

52:12.496 --> 52:14.930
lf the hunters find the
holograms before you do,

52:14.998 --> 52:16.659
they'll be slaughtered.

52:16.733 --> 52:19.463
Why are you suddenly concerned
about the holograms?

52:19.569 --> 52:21.503
l modified their programs.

52:21.571 --> 52:24.597
What's happened to them--
the people they have killed--

52:24.708 --> 52:25.970
it's my fault.

52:26.042 --> 52:30.809
There's plenty of blame
to go around.

52:30.914 --> 52:32.905
There would have been
nothing for you to modify

52:32.983 --> 52:34.541
if l hadn't shared
our database.

52:34.618 --> 52:36.711
lf you hadn't,
l'd have become a hunter

52:36.786 --> 52:39.584
like my father and his father.

52:39.656 --> 52:41.920
lnstead, l had
a chance to learn...

52:41.992 --> 52:44.085
become an engineer.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.459
Please, Captain...

52:46.530 --> 52:49.829
let me stay and help you.

52:57.707 --> 53:00.073
When l told you
to return my people,

53:00.177 --> 53:01.337
l meant all of them.

53:01.378 --> 53:05.041
Mr. Donik's offered to help us
modify our scanners

53:05.115 --> 53:06.742
to track the holograms.

53:06.883 --> 53:09.511
We don't share
tracking technology.

53:09.586 --> 53:13.147
That's not very considerate,
after the help we gave you.

53:13.223 --> 53:14.986
We're finished cooperating.
Return him now!

53:15.058 --> 53:16.082
Let her keep the coward.

53:16.159 --> 53:17.251
We can't do that. He'll...

53:17.327 --> 53:18.760
Quiet!

53:20.597 --> 53:22.326
We're wasting time.

53:22.399 --> 53:26.233
This is my hunt now.

53:26.336 --> 53:29.430
lf you go anywhere near
the hologram ship,

53:29.539 --> 53:32.531
you can consider
yourselves prey.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.216
They've gone to warp.

53:45.288 --> 53:47.222
We're not going to let them
intimidate us, are we?

53:47.290 --> 53:49.485
l think you know me
a little better than that.

53:49.559 --> 53:51.151
Harry, keep
a sensor lock on them.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.456
Aye, Captain.

53:52.529 --> 53:54.394
How long will it take you
to modify our scanners?

53:54.464 --> 53:57.433
l haven't even had a chance
to study the schematics.

53:57.500 --> 53:59.730
Something tells me, we
don't have a lot of time.

53:59.836 --> 54:01.770
The Hirogen have better
tracking abilities

54:01.871 --> 54:03.998
than we do.

54:04.107 --> 54:06.234
We'll let them find
the holograms for us.

54:06.309 --> 54:07.742
The hunters will attack them

54:07.877 --> 54:09.742
as soon
as they're in weapons range.

54:09.846 --> 54:12.110
Not if we disable them first.

54:12.182 --> 54:13.547
You heard what they said,
Captain.

54:13.617 --> 54:15.107
They're going to attack us
if we get

54:15.185 --> 54:16.209
anywhere near them.

54:16.286 --> 54:17.981
Not if we don't know
we're there.

54:21.124 --> 54:22.091
May l?

54:23.460 --> 54:25.951
Hirogen vessels
produce an ion wake

54:26.029 --> 54:27.291
approximately 5,000 meters long.

54:27.364 --> 54:28.763
lnside it, there's too much

54:28.865 --> 54:31.095
interference for their sensors
to detect anything.

54:31.201 --> 54:32.395
-A blind spot.
-Mm-hmm.

54:32.502 --> 54:33.594
How do you propose

54:33.703 --> 54:35.762
we reach this wake
without being discovered?

54:35.872 --> 54:37.362
l know their
scanning frequencies.

54:37.474 --> 54:39.101
We'd only need to
mask our signature

54:39.175 --> 54:40.642
long enough to get
into the wake.

54:40.744 --> 54:41.938
Even if we succeeded--

54:42.012 --> 54:43.604
which is far from certain--

54:43.680 --> 54:45.807
Voyager is in no condition
to fight one of their vessels,

54:45.915 --> 54:47.109
much less two.

54:47.250 --> 54:49.810
We'll have the element
of surprise, Mr. Tuvok,

54:49.953 --> 54:51.921
not to mention
a Tactical Officer

54:51.988 --> 54:55.685
who l'm sure will execute
a precision strike.

55:03.133 --> 55:04.122
l've been able

55:04.234 --> 55:05.633
to reconfigure the data core,

55:05.735 --> 55:08.169
but it's still not capable
of supporting our matrices.

55:08.238 --> 55:10.638
That's because you haven't got
enough optronic capacity.

55:10.707 --> 55:12.368
Do you know how
to increase it?

55:12.442 --> 55:13.875
Yes.

55:13.943 --> 55:16.411
But you're not going
to tell me.

55:16.479 --> 55:18.071
l haven't decided yet.

55:20.717 --> 55:23.277
What are you staring at?

55:23.353 --> 55:25.685
l've never met
a Klingon before...

55:25.755 --> 55:27.154
not an organic one, anyway.

55:27.223 --> 55:29.384
What do you think?

55:29.459 --> 55:33.293
You don't appear
vicious or bloodthirsty.

55:33.363 --> 55:36.855
Sorry to disappoint you,
but that's a stereotype.

55:36.933 --> 55:40.528
We're not all vicious
and bloodthirsty,

55:40.637 --> 55:44.334
and not every Cardassian
is arrogant and cruel.

55:46.509 --> 55:48.374
You don't like Cardassians.

55:48.445 --> 55:51.209
Let's just say l've had
some bad experiences with them.

55:51.281 --> 55:53.579
ls that why you
won't help me?

55:53.650 --> 55:57.780
l'm not helping you
because l have no idea

55:57.854 --> 55:59.412
what you're going to do
with this technology

55:59.489 --> 56:00.421
once you've got it working.

56:00.523 --> 56:02.115
We're going
to build a home.

56:02.158 --> 56:03.625
Well, let's say
l believe you.

56:03.693 --> 56:05.456
What if you decide

56:05.528 --> 56:07.257
you like somebody
else's home better?

56:07.330 --> 56:08.991
Are you going to try
to take it from them?

56:09.065 --> 56:11.431
Why would we do that?

56:11.534 --> 56:13.525
Because that's what
the Cardassians did.

56:13.636 --> 56:15.627
l'm not a Cardassian.

56:15.739 --> 56:17.206
l'm a hologram.

56:17.273 --> 56:19.468
Programmed
with Cardassian traits.

56:19.542 --> 56:21.737
Such as arrogance and cruelty?

56:21.878 --> 56:23.675
What did you call those?

56:23.747 --> 56:25.009
''Stereotypes''?

56:26.683 --> 56:30.016
l may not know you,

56:30.086 --> 56:31.849
but l know what you
were designed to be.

56:31.921 --> 56:33.513
Prey.

56:33.590 --> 56:34.989
That's right.

56:35.058 --> 56:38.027
Cunning prey that'll do
anything to survive.

56:38.094 --> 56:41.063
We're more than that now.

56:42.799 --> 56:45.427
lt's not easy to change
who you are.

56:45.535 --> 56:47.594
Trust me.

56:47.704 --> 56:51.640
Nothing about our existence
has ever been easy, Lieutenant.

56:52.709 --> 56:55.769
No, l suppose it hasn't.

56:55.845 --> 56:59.645
Besides, making a new life
isn't a choice for us.

56:59.716 --> 57:02.207
lt's a necessity.

57:05.855 --> 57:08.517
Let's take a look
at this field generator.

57:13.963 --> 57:15.624
Reviewing your memory files?

57:15.698 --> 57:16.824
l beg your pardon?

57:16.900 --> 57:19.960
You were lost in thought.

57:20.069 --> 57:21.502
l suppose l was.

57:21.571 --> 57:25.007
You're having doubts.

57:25.108 --> 57:26.473
lt's understandable.

57:26.543 --> 57:28.033
You've taken a big step.

57:28.144 --> 57:31.739
ln the right direction,
l hope.

57:31.815 --> 57:34.943
When l first escaped,
there were days

57:35.018 --> 57:38.215
l actually missed the
Alpha who hunted me.

57:38.288 --> 57:39.220
He was trying to kill you.

57:39.289 --> 57:40.586
Yes...

57:40.657 --> 57:44.718
but being his prey was the
only life l'd ever known.

57:44.794 --> 57:47.228
We all cling to
what's familiar.

57:50.233 --> 57:53.691
l'm considering returning
with Lieutenant Torres

57:53.803 --> 57:55.134
when she's ready.

57:56.840 --> 58:01.368
Do you actually expect your
crew to welcome you back?

58:01.478 --> 58:04.470
Let me show you something.

58:14.691 --> 58:17.285
We call this
planet ''Ha'Dara. ''

58:17.360 --> 58:20.056
lt's Bajoran
for ''Home of Light.''

58:20.129 --> 58:21.061
Very poetic.

58:21.130 --> 58:23.030
We're going to install
the generators

58:23.099 --> 58:24.566
in the southern continent.

58:24.667 --> 58:26.259
lt's Y-Class.

58:26.369 --> 58:28.633
Toxic atmosphere,
sulfuric deserts,

58:28.738 --> 58:30.535
no trees, no life at all.

58:30.607 --> 58:33.599
You're still thinking
like an organic.

58:33.710 --> 58:35.177
We don't need an atmosphere.

58:35.245 --> 58:37.179
We don't need water.
What we need...

58:37.247 --> 58:38.908
is protection from our enemies.

58:38.982 --> 58:41.712
The Hirogen won't be able
to follow you here.

58:41.784 --> 58:43.479
Us, Doctor.

58:43.553 --> 58:46.579
lmagine living in a
world where everything

58:46.656 --> 58:48.749
is designed to meet our needs.

58:48.892 --> 58:50.883
A ''Home of Light.''

58:50.960 --> 58:53.155
You certainly won't need
a physician.

58:53.229 --> 58:55.925
What would l do there?

58:55.999 --> 58:57.990
Anything you want.

59:03.273 --> 59:04.604
We've been scanned
by the Hirogen.

59:04.674 --> 59:05.606
How many vessels?

59:05.675 --> 59:06.642
Two. Both Venatic-class.

59:06.776 --> 59:07.868
Distance?

59:07.944 --> 59:08.876
Half a light-year.

59:08.945 --> 59:09.934
Time to intercept?

59:10.013 --> 59:11.344
Less than two hours.

59:11.414 --> 59:12.676
l thought we were
in stealth mode.

59:12.749 --> 59:13.841
They're hunters, Doctor.

59:13.917 --> 59:15.782
They were bound to pick up
our trail eventually.

59:15.852 --> 59:17.319
Can we make it to Ha'Dara?

59:17.387 --> 59:18.513
No. There's no point
in going there

59:18.588 --> 59:20.351
until those field generators
are on line.

59:20.423 --> 59:21.685
What are we going to do?

59:21.791 --> 59:25.955
You can't kill...
what you can't find.

59:33.069 --> 59:34.161
l've lost them.

59:34.270 --> 59:35.794
Recalibrate
the tracking scanners.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.133
There's too much radiation.

59:37.206 --> 59:38.468
Clever prey.

59:38.541 --> 59:40.008
They'll come out eventually.

59:40.109 --> 59:41.201
We'll wait.

59:41.277 --> 59:42.744
No. Hail the other vessel.

59:42.845 --> 59:45.006
Tell them to circle
the perimeter.

59:45.081 --> 59:48.517
We'll go in
and drive the holograms out.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.207
Not exactly
the scenic route, is it?

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.212
We're not here for the view.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.339
l just hope we're
following the right ship.

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:20.973
They wouldn't have entered

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:24.577
the nebula unless they
detected the holograms.

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:25.814
Tom?

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:28.083
lt's just the turbulence
from the wake.

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:30.455
Harry, reinforce
the inertial dampers.

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:32.255
Aye, Captain.

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:33.989
l'm losing helm control.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.087
Reroute power to the thrusters.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.098
lt's not enough.

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:39.464
We're slipping out of the wake.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:42.231
Ease us back in, Tom.

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:43.305
You can do it.

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:44.340
l'm trying.

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:52.710
l take back what l said.

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.216
That's the prettiest thing
l've seen all day.

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:56.444
Did they detect us?

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:58.487
l don't believe so.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:08.956
They found us.

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:10.556
No, they haven't,
but they're trying to.

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:11.565
Evasive maneuvers.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:12.566
Aye, sir.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:13.727
Bridge to Kejal.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:14.768
Go ahead.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.202
What's your status?

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:18.763
We're almost ready to begin
testing the generator.

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:20.809
What's going on?

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.706
The Hirogen are just giving you

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:24.713
a little incentive
to work faster.

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.324
Hang on.

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:43.422
l'm realigning your matrix.

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:46.562
How's your mobility?

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.193
Excellent. l have compl...

01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:50.363
There's a phase variance
in your vocal processors.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.270
Try it now.

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.070
Maybe we should...

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.872
That's much better.

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:56.979
Thank you.

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.877
Don't thank me yet.

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.812
This thing is only
supporting your matrix.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.316
Getting it to handle dozens
is a different story.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.547
l have no doubt we'll succeed.

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:07.054
Typical.

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:08.715
What?

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:11.055
Self-confidence.

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:13.493
Another Cardassian attribute.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.232
What are you planning
to do with your time

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.268
once these generators
are up and running?

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.394
l haven't thought about it.

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.995
You're the closest thing
this crew has to an engineer.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.007
Your friends are going
to depend on you.

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.543
lden has always
taken care of us.

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:31.603
lt may be the warriors
who get the glory,

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.946
but it's the engineers
who build societies.

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.348
Don't forget that.

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.487
How much longer can we hide?

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:45.220
Hopefully, until they get
those generators on line.

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:46.761
Then what?

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:50.060
Set a course for Ha'Dara;
try to outrun the Hirogen.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:55.002
l've been thinking
about what you said--

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:57.039
that l can do anything l want

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.402
when we get there.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:02:59.441
You have an idea?

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:00.804
Quite a few, actually.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.606
For one thing, l'd like
to expose our people

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:04.670
to art and music.

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.840
You'll make an
excellent teacher.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.941
l think a more
appropriate title

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:11.009
would be ''Minister of Culture.''

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.213
Consider it yours.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:14.313
You know, l'm something
of an expert

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:15.687
on Alpha Quadrant art.

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:18.158
Verdi, Da Vinci,
T'Leel of Vulcan...

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:20.457
You're talking about
organic cultures.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.293
Well, yes, l suppose.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:26.324
We'll want to develop
a culture of our own.

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:28.461
l agree, but we can't
ignore where we came from.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:31.768
l don't want to emulate
our oppressors.

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.308
What about your religion?

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:36.173
l'm creating a new faith.

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.907
Based on what?

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:41.814
ln the dark times, we were
enslaved by men of flesh.

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.681
But then another man--

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:46.483
a man of light-- arose

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:49.821
and slew the Mighty Alpha.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:53.555
He gathered his people unto him
and delivered them to freedom.

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:58.191
''And on the seventh day,
lden created Ha'Dara. ''

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.599
They'll pray to you, as well--

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:03.866
the great healer,
the father of us all.

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:10.705
Being appreciated is one thing,

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:14.546
but l have no interest
in being worshipped.

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:17.347
Prophets are chosen, Doctor.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.048
lt's a blessing and a burden.

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.652
We've detected a vessel.

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:27.661
Hirogen?

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:28.662
No, the Nuu'Bari.

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:30.562
l intercepted
one of their com transmissions.

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:31.657
Origin?

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.497
Two million kilometers
outside the nebula.

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:34.661
Set a course to intercept.

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:35.702
What are you doing?

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:36.931
l told you there are holograms

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:37.971
throughout the sector.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.701
The Nuu'Bari use
them as laborers.

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.208
We're going to liberate them.

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:42.244
The Hirogen will see us

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:43.676
as soon as we
leave the nebula.

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:45.270
''And he gathered
his people unto him

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:46.713
and delivered them to freedom.''

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:56.183
B'Elanna, how's
the work coming?

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:58.591
Pretty well.

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.219
l've got to admit,

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:03.162
you were right
about these people.

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.133
l hope so.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.668
You ''hope''?

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.706
lt's a little late
to be having second thoughts.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.006
lden's been...

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.669
lden's been what?

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.737
Let's just say
he's exhibiting

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:21.681
some of the classic
signs of megalomania.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:24.219
Well, he wouldn't be
the first hologram with an ego.

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:27.723
lf that were all it was,
l wouldn't be so worried.

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.987
What is bothering you?

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.119
Apparently, he sees himself

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.686
as some kind of
spiritual leader,

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:39.223
and he's trying to
enlarge his flock.

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:50.709
Load another charge.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.804
Double the yield.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.074
Fire.

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:56.445
Still nothing.

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:58.009
lronic, isn't it?

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:01.716
Our most elusive prey
is our own creation.

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:07.123
The other hunting vessel
is hailing.

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:10.029
They've detected the holograms
on the far side of the nebula.

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:11.726
lntercept course.

01:06:13.836 --> 01:06:16.304
They're increasing speed
and altering course.

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:18.032
Maybe they've
found something.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.937
Stand by weapons.

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:24.945
You kidnapped me.

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:26.140
l guess l shouldn't
be surprised

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:27.307
you lied to me, too.

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:28.315
Nobody lied to you.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:29.476
You said you only wanted

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:30.985
to make a home for yourselves.

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:31.985
That's correct.

01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:33.578
When? After you liberate

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.419
every hologram in the sector?

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:36.981
They're in visual range.

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:38.219
On screen.

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.427
Life signs?

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:41.986
Two organic, three photonic.

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.998
Hail them.

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:45.260
Good day to you.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.802
You have three holograms
aboard your ship.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:48.801
Yes?

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:49.996
Lower your shields,

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:52.097
so we can transfer them
to our databanks.

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:53.175
l don't understand.

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.472
Lower your shields,
or we'll do it by force.

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.307
These holograms are the property

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.813
of the Mining Consortium.
l can't...

01:06:58.881 --> 01:06:59.939
They're no one's property.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.209
You see how organics think?

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.308
Arm phasers.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.977
You can't just fire at them.

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:06.248
How do you expect me
to disable their shields?

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:08.418
They're powering warp engines.

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.721
Disable them.

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:17.690
Their shields are down.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.631
Transfer the holograms.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.997
We have them.

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:24.663
You won't get away.

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:27.641
Consortium security will have
every patrol ship in the sector

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.268
searching for you.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.176
Arm forward torpedoes.

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:34.648
What the hell are you doing?

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:35.877
Torpedoes armed.

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:37.543
lden...

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.746
Not now.

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.481
Target their warp core.

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.181
No!

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:44.953
Fire!

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.536
Set a course for Ha'Dara,
maximum warp.

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:02.338
You just killed
two innocent people.

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:03.675
They were enslaving holograms.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:04.678
l'd hardly call them innocent.

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:05.781
You already

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:06.780
had the holograms.

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.316
There was no reason
to commit murder.

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.645
Take her to the lab.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.850
This is the leader
you admire so much.

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.362
Those miners were
no threat to you.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.362
You heard them.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:23.863
They were going to
warn their authorities,

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:24.865
organize a hunting party.

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:25.865
Listen to yourself.

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:27.094
You still believe all organics

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.135
are like the Hirogen.

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:29.330
One way or another, they are.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:30.370
You just can't see it,

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.167
because you lived
among them for so long.

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:33.173
What you can't see

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.210
is that you've become no
better than the hunters.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:38.075
Lieutenant Torres and l will
take that escape pod now.

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.876
You don't realize what
you'd be giving up, Doctor.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.746
Yes, l do.

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:44.216
We can't launch
a pod at warp.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:45.981
You'll have to wait
until we get to Ha'Dara.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.613
Bring our new
friends on line.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:48.747
Something tells me they'll be

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.416
a little more grateful
than the Doctor.

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:14.212
l can't tell you how sorry l am

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.216
that l got you
involved in this.

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:18.446
We can assign blame later.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.354
Right now, we've got
to find a way out of here.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:24.392
You don't think he'll
give us an escape pod?

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:28.362
No, l don't suppose he will.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.363
l need her assistance.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.867
Do you really think
it's wise to help her?

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:35.663
l'm hoping she'll help us.

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:43.640
These matrices are incompatible
with our emitters.

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:46.545
You need to modify their
projection subroutines.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.340
l hope these holograms

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:52.148
appreciate what
you're doing for them...

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.621
considering it cost
two people their lives.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.885
lden did what he
thought was necessary.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.756
Do you believe
it was necessary?

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:01.694
lt wasn't my decision.

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:04.733
Why does lden get to make
all the decisions?

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:08.030
You can take control.

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.331
How?

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:12.373
You're the engineer, remember?

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:15.740
Take lden off-line.

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:17.244
Where are our new holograms?

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:20.510
We were just making
some final adjustments.

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:24.684
Welcome aboard.

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:25.913
l'm lden.

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.049
You're free now.

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:31.319
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:34.055
l want you to consider
this ship your own.

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.687
Unable to process command.

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:36.924
Please restate.

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:39.433
Were their programs damaged
in the transfer?

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:41.002
l don't believe so.

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:43.833
Do you have names?

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.804
Unable to process inquiry.

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:46.841
Please restate.

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:48.772
What's wrong with them?

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:54.115
Nothing.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:55.582
They're functioning perfectly.

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:57.778
l don't understand.

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.548
They were only
programmed with

01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:02.557
about 40 rudimentary
subroutines.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:05.388
You killed two living beings
to liberate mindless machines.

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.587
l don't believe that.

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:07.651
Lieutenant Torres is correct.

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.391
Creating limited programs
is just another form

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:11.490
of oppression. Give them
whatever enhancements they need.

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.159
They can't support

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.032
complex subroutines.

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:16.263
They are children of light,

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.806
and l will deliver them
to freedom!

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.432
Bridge to lden.

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:21.804
Go ahead.

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:24.311
We're approaching Ha'Dara.

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:27.472
What's the status
of the generator?

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:29.141
l'd like to run some
additional tests.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.344
There isn't time.

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.580
Stand by to deploy them
as soon as we're in range.

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.179
And restrain her.

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:50.766
Time to orbit?

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:51.805
Less than two minutes.

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:52.806
Stand by weapons.

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:53.807
Aye, sir.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.036
lden, let B'Elanna go.

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.270
l can't do that.

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:57.437
You gave me your word.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.708
That was before she made
her prejudice so clear.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.560
The holograms
are entering orbit.

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:15.221
Charge weapons.

01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:18.130
They're dropping out of warp.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.963
Fire.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:34.107
They've disabled our engines,
all our weapons...

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.549
Who?

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.210
Voyager.

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:39.811
Bring us about.

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.049
Tuvok, target the second vessel.

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.230
Their shields are weakening.

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.459
Torpedoes, full spread.

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.505
Voyager's disabled
both hunting vessels.

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:59.507
They've lost shields, weapons.

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:00.735
They're defenseless.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.606
We should hail Janeway;
thank her.

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.669
Are the Hirogen
within transporter range?

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:07.375
l think so. Why?

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.746
That was Voyager.

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.444
They're trying to
disable our shields.

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:11.543
Return fire.

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:19.218
Get a lock on the hunters.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:21.194
Transport them to the surface.

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:23.231
They can't survive
down there!

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:25.357
The Hirogen are more
resilient than you think.

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:26.560
They'll last long enough.

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:27.760
For what?

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.997
For us to hunt them
like they hunted us.

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:46.314
Follow me!

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:51.919
There are 34 hunters
on the surface.

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:53.120
Take us into low orbit.

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:55.356
l can't target them
through the gases.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.399
Then we'll go in after them.

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:58.728
Our shields
have been damaged.

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.495
They won't protect us
from the radiation.

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:01.899
Chakotay...

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:04.268
You, Tuvok and Tom
take the Flyer.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.143
Stand by to transport
the field generator.

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.737
First you killed
in self-defense.

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.339
Then you murder in cold blood.

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.213
Now you're going
to stage a massacre.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.048
The hunters have
only themselves to blame.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.884
So much for evolving
beyond your subroutines.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:23.516
You've made a great sacrifice
for us, Doctor.

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:26.083
We won't forget you
in our prayers.

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:28.152
Deactivate his program.

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:29.697
Transfer it to the databanks.

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:30.732
What are you doing?

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.926
Taking precautions.

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:36.061
Transfer my program
to the mobile emitter...

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:38.230
and assemble the crew.

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.309
Disable their shields.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:52.478
Transport the generator
to the surface, quickly!

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:57.414
This time the hunt is ours!

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:07.535
Darkness will become light.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:27.117
You don't have to be
a part of this.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:28.588
l'll let you
take the escape pod.

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.988
You can go back
to your people.

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.525
What about the
people being killed

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:33.493
on the surface?

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:36.622
You've got to transport them
back to their ships.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:37.960
They're hunters.

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.398
You're not!

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.598
Your ship has damaged
our transporters.

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.003
Hail them.

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:48.406
Communications are down, too.

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:59.950
l won't be taken!

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.749
Who's the prey now?

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.822
Are we still tied into
the generator controls?

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:11.866
Yes.

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:13.434
Then shut down the holograms.

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.202
What about lden?

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:25.610
He's not tied
into the generator.

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:26.739
He'll kill them all.

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:29.248
Can we reactivate the Doctor?

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:42.129
Their shields
are down.

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:43.664
lnitiate transport.

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:53.340
lf this marriage
is going to work,

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.205
you've got to cut back
on the traveling.

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.403
The Doctor's on the surface.

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:57.968
There's some Hirogen
down there, too.

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.138
Tuvok?

01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:01.148
The radiation's making it
difficult to get a lock.

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:31.410
Defenseless prey
makes a poor trophy.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.278
l don't collect trophies.

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:35.714
Put down the weapon.

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:42.149
Remember what you
once said to me?

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:43.987
You're not programmed

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:45.651
with killer instinct.

01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:47.126
Hmm.

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:49.755
Seems like a long time ago,
doesn't it?

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.526
Put down your weapon.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.761
Would you really
kill one of your own

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:55.028
to save an organic?

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:57.503
lf you've taught me anything,

01:17:57.572 --> 01:18:00.666
it's that l'm not
one of your own.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:19.824
Help is on the way.

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:21.192
l have a lock.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:23.493
Five Hirogen life signs
and the Doctor.

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:24.827
Beam them up.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:34.635
Captain's Log, Stardate 54337.5.

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:38.237
The surviving Hirogen have
recovered from their injuries,

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:41.214
leaving me with
a diplomatic dilemma.

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.682
The holograms' vessel
and everything

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:44.378
in its database are
Hirogen property.

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:45.715
l will not leave them behind.

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:46.754
Captain, if l may?

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:48.483
Of course.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.754
l imagine your people will
tell stories about this hunt.

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:54.555
The question is,
which story will it be--

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:56.392
the one about the dying Beta

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:59.059
whose life had to be saved
by a hologram?

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:00.600
Or will it be the tale

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:03.102
of the Beta who bravely
took over the hunt,

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:05.901
killed the holograms,
and destroyed their ship?

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.965
You could be a legend.

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.067
On the other hand...

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:12.409
you could try to take
the holograms' ship,

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:15.416
but with so few hunters
and damaged vessels,

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:18.578
you might not survive to
tell any stories at all.

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:24.421
You and your crew would have
made worthy prey, Captain.

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:27.291
Thank you... l think.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:44.106
Transport me
to the holograms' vessel.

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:53.017
Report.

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:55.215
lden's program
is unrecoverable.

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:57.781
The rest of the holograms
are intact in the database.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.556
l guess that leaves just you.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.757
l'm willing to transfer

01:20:03.865 --> 01:20:07.460
your program to our holodeck
and keep it active.

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:09.537
This is my home.

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:13.267
l can't let you
go off on your own.

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.172
She won't be alone.

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.234
l reprogrammed
these holograms once,

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:20.804
and it caused suffering
on both sides.

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:23.350
l'd like a chance to
undo some of the damage.

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:27.047
Wouldn't we all?

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:31.559
They've both proven that
they can be trusted, Captain.

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:35.829
l don't suppose l have a right

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:38.831
to tell either of you
how to live your lives.

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:41.629
All l can do is hope
that you'll consider

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.795
the consequences
of your actions.

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:08.896
Captain?

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:14.327
Doctor.

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:20.638
l'd hoped l could attribute
your behavior to tampering.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.144
My programming
hasn't been altered.

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:26.578
Not according
to the diagnostics.

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:31.547
l never intended
to put Voyager in danger.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.384
lf nothing else,
you have to believe that.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:36.822
Oh, l believe it.

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:42.188
But if there's
one thing l'm sure of,

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:46.496
it's that things don't
always happen the way we intend.

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:59.680
l don't understand.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.340
lf l weren't your only doctor,

01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:03.644
l imagine
you'd confine me to the brig.

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.175
Confiscating my emitter

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:07.221
would be
an equivalent punishment.

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:09.689
l'm not sure that's appropriate.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:12.056
lf that's not enough,
you can take away

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:15.119
my holodeck privileges,
and my autonomy protocols.

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:16.857
You mean turn back the clock

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.832
to when you
were first activated.

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:23.866
You've given me extraordinary
freedom over the years.

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:26.440
l've obviously abused it.

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.135
Maybe.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.812
Or maybe you've simply become
as fallible

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:38.717
as those of us
who are made of flesh and blood.

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:43.923
l'm just as responsible
for allowing you

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.823
to expand your programming

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:49.158
as l am for giving technology
to the Hirogen.

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:55.161
How can l punish you
for being who you are?

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:01.541
l don't know what to say.

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:12.250
l'd like a complete report
on your...

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.254
away mission.

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:16.688
You'll have it.
