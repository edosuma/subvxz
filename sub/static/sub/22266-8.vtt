00:09.885 --> 00:10.921
Oh, my God...

00:11.470 --> 00:13.177
Oh, my God what? Who is that?

00:16.975 --> 00:18.182
That's Tommy Merlyn.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.185
He died over four years ago.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.101
Oliver, who's Tommy Merlyn?

00:28.403 --> 00:29.519
Thea's other brother.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.028
And my best friend.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.207
We're gonna need a moment alone.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.342
He's a crony.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.504
- Anachronism.
- That's what I said.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.554
Lately, we've been dealing
with Anachronisms.

00:57.641 --> 01:00.304
It's people and things
displaced throughout time.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.762
Okay, but why would Nazis from 1945
want to crash my wedding?

01:04.355 --> 01:06.598
Crab legs. They were delicious.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.191
Well, Iris has a point though.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.317
If they're out of time,
they would have targeted

01:10.404 --> 01:12.066
the military or law enforcement.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.856
Tommy was plucked from five years ago
and put in the Prometheus wardrobe.

01:14.950 --> 01:15.940
That doesn't make any sense.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.321
It does if we're not dealing
with an Anachronism.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.911
Visitors from another Earth?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.196
What, there are more than one?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.156
There are 52, actually.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.793
Though I'm hard-pressed to think
of one where Nazis are ascendant.

01:26.962 --> 01:27.952
I can.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.750
There's a 53rd Earth.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.211
And it's called Earth-X.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.431
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

01:44.438 --> 01:46.179
It doesn't have a designation

01:46.273 --> 01:47.809
because it's a place so awful,

01:47.899 --> 01:50.061
so horrific,

01:50.652 --> 01:52.609
no sane person
would ever travel there.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.604
It's basically our Earth,

01:54.698 --> 01:56.940
same history, same timeline with

01:57.618 --> 01:59.951
one crucial and critical difference.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.444
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>Let me hypothesize.</i>

02:01.747 --> 02:05.411
The Nazis developed the atomic bomb
before the United States did

02:05.500 --> 02:06.866
and they were more than happy
to use it?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.043
Yes. The Nazis won the war.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.501
And New York, London, Paris
and Moscow were all obliterated.

02:12.591 --> 02:15.925
The SS set up outposts not only
all throughout Europe

02:16.011 --> 02:17.798
<i>but also all throughout the Americas,</i>

02:18.639 --> 02:20.847
and Hitler continued his brutal reign,

02:21.350 --> 02:24.593
aided by prime ministers
and presidents sympathetic to him,

02:24.978 --> 02:26.059
until his death

02:26.730 --> 02:28.016
in 1994.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.474
Now they're not happy ruling
just one Earth.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.648
God, this is making me
physically ill.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.399
Yeah, line starts behind me.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.777
We have to find them.

02:39.284 --> 02:42.072
I mean, do you think they're using
the breach to hop between worlds?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.154
That, or they're operating
from a staging area,

02:44.247 --> 02:45.909
somewhere in Central City
or close by.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.916
Well, good thing we have a metric ton
of smart people in this building.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.208
And Rory.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.545
Let's get to work on finding
our new friends from Earth-X.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.707
- OLIVER: Earth-X.
- That's right.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.920
And I'm dead on this Earth?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.176
That's right.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.099
I'd almost prefer that.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.349
I was born into the Reich.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.019
The whole world is the Fatherland.

03:12.109 --> 03:15.352
We don't have elementary schools
and summer camps.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.062
We have youth groups

03:18.990 --> 03:20.151
and military training.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.780
We all grow up without choice.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.323
You have a choice now.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.665
You can tell me where to find
the others from Earth-X.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.999
On my Earth, you are my best friend.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.375
I would die for you.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.628
I would have died for you.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.097
- "Would have"?
- You beat me to it.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.929
I lost you. It was like...

03:48.895 --> 03:51.103
It was like losing a limb and...

03:54.276 --> 03:55.687
You weren't just my best friend.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.523
Tommy, you were my brother

03:58.864 --> 04:02.357
and you sacrificed yourself
for a woman that we both loved

04:02.451 --> 04:04.568
and I was there
and I had you right here.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.084
You were a good man here.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.664
And I believe
that you still can be.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.083
No, you don't understand.
If I talk...

04:20.927 --> 04:23.089
If I break, the FÃ¼hrer will kill

04:23.722 --> 04:27.056
my father. He'll kill my mother.
Everyone that I love...

04:27.142 --> 04:28.303
I will not let that happen.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.177
I will stop him.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.015
Do you think you can do that?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.483
I promise you that I can do that.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.228
(SIGHS)

04:46.870 --> 04:50.489
Then you really are
a special kind of idiot.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.164
Your naivete would be charming

04:56.463 --> 05:00.002
if your weakness wasn't so pathetic.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.792
Is this how it is on your planet?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.170
Everybody's swayed by sentiment?

05:06.264 --> 05:10.053
Is everyone here really so weak?

05:12.729 --> 05:13.970
The Reich will change that.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.309
<i>The weak will be eliminated.</i>

05:16.399 --> 05:19.767
Your entire world will be enslaved.
But you, you...

05:21.363 --> 05:23.275
You won't be around
to witness it.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.819
He is going to feel your skull crack

05:29.329 --> 05:32.868
under the weight of his boot.
Everyone you care about,

05:33.375 --> 05:35.332
<i>everyone you love,</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:38.581
they're gonna die badly.

05:42.217 --> 05:47.008
In ways that would give
even monsters nightmares.

could live to see it.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.221
He's gone.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.767
Who? Merlyn?

06:44.988 --> 06:47.150
The biosensor in his suit indicates
his heart stopped.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.028
He always seemed kinda soft to me.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.157
- Oliver...
- He died for you.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.907
And we will make
his death worthwhile.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.752
That doesn't change the fact
that now we're down a man.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.872
Keep your focus where it belongs.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.549
And get to work on locating
that Prism.

07:07.636 --> 07:08.717
Watch your tone.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.553
Or I'll watch it for you.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.349
Oliver!

07:21.066 --> 07:23.900
Did you just tell me
to watch my tone?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.942
You're angry...

07:29.824 --> 07:32.407
- And I like it.
- Don't you mock me.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.610
Don't threaten me.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.653
Or have you forgotten...

07:37.582 --> 07:41.246
I could end your life
before you birth your next thought.

07:43.672 --> 07:47.541
Try it, once I break
every bone in your body.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.375
Okay.

07:51.346 --> 07:54.680
We're all a little emotional.
Here's what I suggest.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.725
I will stop vibrating my hand,

07:58.561 --> 08:02.350
you stop breaking my wrist,
and you...

08:02.816 --> 08:06.105
Be 10% less brooding.

We accomplish nothing by arguing
amongst ourselves.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.198
It's the accomplishing nothing
that has me concerned.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.750
We came here to conquer this Earth,
or have you forgotten?

08:23.837 --> 08:24.998
Locate the Prism.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.539
Please.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.585
Once we have identified
the location of the target,

08:33.304 --> 08:34.966
I will devise a plan of attack.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.558
I'm sorry about Merlyn.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.607
He should've died in the church

08:46.693 --> 08:48.434
before he allowed himself
to be captured.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.897
Kara, we need that Prism.
We are running out of time.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.983
You have to trust
in the plan, Oliver.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.577
You should. It's yours.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.326

for the Earth-Xers.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.857
I linked S.T.A.R. Labs' system
up with ours

using some sort of
dimensional something.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.543
I told Curtis to do the same thing
with quantum field analysis.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.719
- I'm sorry about Tommy.
- That wasn't Tommy.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.719
He said that they are trying
to mount some sort of invasion.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.679
I guess the silver lining
to Black Siren

10:06.773 --> 10:08.810
is that we have experience
with doppelgangers.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.525
So, if it's not Tommy I'm reading
on your face, what's up?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.030
You know what it is.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.535
Well, maybe we should wait
until we repel invaders

10:21.621 --> 10:24.034
from another Earth
to have this conversation.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.332
Remember when we got back from Ivy Town?
Do you remember Ivy Town?

10:27.418 --> 10:28.659
Mmm. So fondly.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.962
When we got back,
you said that we could do this

10:33.675 --> 10:35.337
and we could still have our lives.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.461
- That was you.
- Yeah.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.758
So, um...

10:42.475 --> 10:44.341
This impending invasion
notwithstanding,

10:46.020 --> 10:49.013
may we take two minutes
and talk about this?

10:50.775 --> 10:51.891
Yeah.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.404
So maybe what wasn't fair was me
saying I didn't want to marry you.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.735
I mean, not the way I did.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.695
Not with the most terrible timing
in the world.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.121
Well, was it how I said it?

11:06.207 --> 11:09.166
Because I know that it was really...
I mean, it was spontaneous.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.584
It was so lovely.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.870
It was so sweet.

engaged two years ago.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.914

12:49.352 --> 12:50.468
we're on our own.

We're trying to find the guys
from Earth-X and

12:54.857 --> 12:55.973
we're coming up with nothing.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.775
I'm sorry. Would you excuse us
for a moment?

13:00.780 --> 13:01.816
Happily.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.442
We don't wanna step on whatever...

13:03.533 --> 13:06.116
- Come on, Harry. It's not about you.
- ...awkward, awkward thing that is.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.737
Grey, we got Nazis
from a parallel Earth running around.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.618
- We don't have time...
- Which is precisely why

13:11.708 --> 13:14.826
we cannot afford to be at odds
with each other right now.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.162
I hardly need a psychic connection
to know that you're upset with me.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.543
- But I could stand to know why.
- Just forget about it, man.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.876
It would make some sense if my
decision to be with my family

13:23.970 --> 13:26.087
forced you to leave the <i>Waverider.</i>

13:26.306 --> 13:29.720
But I accounted for that variable
and yet you're still upset.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.017
- You just don't get it...
- No, I don't get it.

13:33.271 --> 13:36.105
My retirement requires you
to give up nothing.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.024
It requires me to give up you, Grey.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.686
Look, I thought I made
my peace with it.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.240
I thought, okay, fine,
I'll stay on the <i>Waverider.</i>

13:46.451 --> 13:49.319
Maybe I can't be Firestorm,
but I can still be a Legend.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.324
But then it hit me.

13:52.123 --> 13:56.242
I still can't be Firestorm,
and I can't be a Legend with you.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.788
I never knew my father.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.582
But I got to know you.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.591
You're the closest thing
I've got to a dad, and...

14:06.804 --> 14:08.011
Now you're leaving.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.107
Hey.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.436
- Hey.
- How are you?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.236
Well, punching Nazis.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.031
That was definitely as satisfying
as I imagined it would be.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.985
You okay?

14:31.496 --> 14:34.534
Yeah. Oh, me?
No, I'm okay.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.705
I'm completely okay.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.658
- I'm okay, okay. Okay.
- Okay.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.247
Okay.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.168
This isn't going to be
a thing, right?

14:44.258 --> 14:46.716
Yeah, no, no, no.
I'm okay, I'm good.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.546
Hey, I was looking for you.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.472
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.015
Why is everybody asking me
that question?

14:54.185 --> 14:58.350
Well, you sort of look like
you just killed someone's puppy.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.391
Uh, no. I'm fine.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.649
It's just this whole thing
with Sara.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.819
God, it was a mistake.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.776
A mistake? But...

15:09.492 --> 15:11.905
You came here to have fun
at a wedding and...

15:11.994 --> 15:15.908
Okay, Nazi invaders aside,
you had a good time, right?

15:16.124 --> 15:19.993
No. I mean,
this was all kinds of wrong.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.629
Waking up with a strange woman
in a strange bed?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.958
I have never had
a one night stand before.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.301
And this whole thing is just...

15:29.804 --> 15:31.340
It's got me spinning.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.678
Kara, I mean, what...

15:33.474 --> 15:35.386
What if I made a huge mistake?

15:35.476 --> 15:37.012
- No...
- Okay, no, no, no. I mean, look,

15:37.103 --> 15:39.470
I know, I wanna have kids.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.436
But Maggie was real.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.892
I mean, what we had, that was real.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.943
And now, with everything,
I just...

15:51.075 --> 15:54.489
I chose to let her go.
I chose that.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.570
I mean, what was I thinking?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.747
Alex, Maggie was amazing.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.917
And you two were amazing together
but the best part about her

16:02.837 --> 16:05.170
was that she showed you
how to be true to yourself.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.506
You want kids. She doesn't.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.007
You just had to do
what was right for you.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.472
What if I was wrong?

16:24.901 --> 16:27.063
How long till you brainiacs
find these Nazis?

16:27.236 --> 16:30.820
My answer hasn't changed in the two
minutes since you last asked me.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.735
Sorry.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.901
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.579
Dealing with some Oliver stuff.

16:39.665 --> 16:45.707
Not "Nazis ruined the happiest day
of our life" stuff, but stuff.

16:46.422 --> 16:50.041
Stuff like, "You don't want
to marry him" stuff?

16:51.761 --> 16:54.299
You might've said it a little loudly
at the rehearsal dinner.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.470
What happened?
I thought at the salon,

16:56.557 --> 16:57.638
you said you guys were good.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.808
We are good. We're great.
We're just as...

17:00.853 --> 17:02.845
We're just as good as we were
the last time we got engaged

17:02.939 --> 17:04.055
and I got shot.

17:06.317 --> 17:09.526
That was the beginning
of the end for us.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.441
I don't want to tempt fate again.
You know?

17:19.955 --> 17:21.413
Break-in at Dayton Optical Systems.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.202
I know this sounds terrible,

17:23.291 --> 17:24.749
but maybe we should let the police
handle it.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.373
I mean, we need our peeps
to focus on the Nazis.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.167
- This is Nazis.
- How do you know?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.337
I'll go get Barry.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.669
Yeah, okay.

I don't have it.

18:04.875 --> 18:05.911

18:07.545 --> 18:09.127
So, what do we know about this place?

Why are the Earth-Xers targeting it?

18:11.632 --> 18:12.713

18:16.012 --> 18:17.628
They had something we need.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.550
Whatever you stole...

18:22.643 --> 18:23.850
We're gonna want it back.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.477
You've faced some of the greatest

And you've defeated them.

of yourselves,</i>

18:33.571 --> 18:34.732

- that comes your way...

18:46.334 --> 18:47.620
How do you feel about us?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.001
This is sick.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.428
To be looking at your reflection
and seeing only weakness?

19:01.432 --> 19:02.468
I agree.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.719
- Thawne.
- Direct from Earth-1.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.846
Do you like my face?

19:09.482 --> 19:11.769
It's the face you were wearing
when I became the Flash.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.066
I thought I'd put it on again.

19:13.152 --> 19:17.613
You know, for old times' sake.
Plus, handsome.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.731
- I watched you die.
- Or did you?

19:20.493 --> 19:21.859
It's time travel, Barry.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.617
So very confusing. I always seem
to be saying that to you, don't I?

19:27.583 --> 19:28.744
Tommy killed himself.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.700
I heard your Tommy died years ago.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.585
That's what this Earth does.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.380
Makes people soft.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.503
We've been watching you.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.585
<i>We've been watching all of you.</i>

19:40.221 --> 19:43.385
And how you've squandered
the potential of two worlds.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.301
On our Earth, we've developed
a meritocracy.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.848
We've accomplished greatness.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.225
You're perverse.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.602
No, Kara, you're the perversion.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.186
The most powerful being
on the planet

19:57.530 --> 20:00.273

20:01.659 --> 20:04.618

in the Fatherland.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.785
Then go back there.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.908
This is not your Earth.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.618
Leave.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.325
I don't answer to the likes of you.

20:11.836 --> 20:16.126
My allegiance is to the Fatherland
and to my wife.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.420
His wife? Gross.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.338
No offense.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.887
Last chance.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.763

No, this arrow won't.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.454
Is that a Kryptonite arrow?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.629
Why do you have a Kryptonite arrow?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.958
In case an evil you ever showed up.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.145

21:15.149 --> 21:17.232
- Are you all right?
- I'm pissed.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.859
(CREAKING)

22:09.537 --> 22:11.403
We need to stabilize the building.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.149
- Site's clear.
- And stabilized.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.227
- Nice work.
- Let's not celebrate just yet.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.733
We gave those doppelgangers
the window they needed to escape.

22:45.823 --> 22:46.939
SUPERGIRL: <i>Escape with what?</i>

22:47.032 --> 22:48.568
Dayton Optical Systems
calls it "the Prism."

22:48.659 --> 22:51.868
What on Earth do they need
a sub-light generator for?

22:51.954 --> 22:53.240
It's basically a spectral emitter...

22:53.330 --> 22:54.787
BOTH: Which uses quantum entanglement.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.491
They could also use it to create
a stable fusion reaction.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.834
Okay, which all means what?

23:01.797 --> 23:05.666
No, guys, really, I'd like to know
what you're talking about.

23:05.759 --> 23:06.840
You got this.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.930
Well, basically the device they stole
can be converted into a neutron bomb.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.006
Boom...

23:13.475 --> 23:14.716
I take it back.

23:15.436 --> 23:16.847
The bottom line is
that we have to catch

23:16.937 --> 23:18.473
these parallel Earth goose-steppers.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.680
This might help.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.273
Is that a Kryptonite arrow?

23:22.359 --> 23:23.566
- Yup.
- I know I shouldn't have to ask

23:23.652 --> 23:24.813
this question, but I have to ask
this question.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.021
- Oliver didn't shoot Kara, did he?
- Sort of.

23:27.698 --> 23:32.113
The other archer and flying woman
are Oliver and Kara of Earth-X.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.403
When you said that Earth-X
was "horrible,"

23:34.496 --> 23:35.532
you might've been under-sold it.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.956
Wait a minute.
How could there be another Kara?

23:38.042 --> 23:39.283
HARRISON: There are 53 Karas.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.502
Just like there's 53 Kryptons
and 53 Earths.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.043
And the Thawne from our Earth
is working with them.

23:45.633 --> 23:46.669
He's an idiot.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.175
If that arrow has Not-So-
Supergirl's blood on it...

23:49.261 --> 23:51.924
We could track it using
quantum analysis.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.050
- We could.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.676
<i>I think I might have a quicker way.</i>

These red blood cells are suffused
with short-wave radiation.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.349
- Solar radiation?
- Yeah. Incredibly high amounts.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.728
Like nothing I've ever seen.

24:04.818 --> 24:05.808
Can you track it?

24:06.111 --> 24:08.819
Well, I once caught a deranged serial
killer off his face cream, so...

24:09.990 --> 24:12.277
- No joke.
- Let's just do it. Fast.

24:12.368 --> 24:13.529
Okay.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.493
Will it work?

24:20.709 --> 24:21.790
It will.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.081
With a few adjustments.

24:24.922 --> 24:26.834
And a significant power source.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.257
My husband's on his way
to handle that as we speak.

24:29.343 --> 24:32.836
Your husband has a choice to make.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.304
Me or the Reich?

24:34.974 --> 24:35.964
That's right.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.516
Because we have two goals.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.680

24:41.063 --> 24:44.807
if we can't accomplish them both,
he's gonna choose you

24:45.192 --> 24:47.855
over a second Earth flying
under our banner.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.235
Oliver will not abandon our mission.

24:50.698 --> 24:53.566
I've seen this before in 1945.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.868
Hitler and his men
were equally short-sighted.

24:56.954 --> 25:00.573
Hitler was driven by passion
and childish need.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.124
Oliver is 10 times
the man Hitler ever was.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.873
Not when he's blinded
by his love for you.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.918
If it comes to Oliver choosing
between me and the Reich,

25:13.971 --> 25:16.463
I'll make sure he chooses
the Fatherland.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.681
- How?
- If it comes to it,

25:20.102 --> 25:22.264
by taking the choice
out of his hands.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.142
Maybe tracking her off of face cream
would have been easier.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.817
HARRISON: Supergirl-X's blood

25:29.903 --> 25:32.987
is filled with solar radiation,
more than it should be.

25:33.073 --> 25:36.942
But if I can try to get that to act
as a kind of beacon...

Bring the other you out of you.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.003
- You don't wanna know.
- Sure I do.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.504
It happens when I'm scared or angry.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.513
So, if I were to, um... Boo!

- HARRISON: Boom.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.853
Whatever's going on
with Kara-X's blood,

26:05.939 --> 26:08.101
- it's intensifying.
- Worse for her is better for us.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.683
Better for us for tracking her,
at least.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.234
We should have her location
any minute.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.493
I can't believe he's back.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.788
I don't know if I'll ever be
rid of him.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.657
I know.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.334
I know how much you're hurting.

how this week was supposed to go.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.063
We can't think about that right now.

26:57.157 --> 27:01.572
You should. We fight to protect
the people that we love,

27:01.662 --> 27:03.779
so you guys, recognize what you have.

It's the same for you

27:17.010 --> 27:18.467
I don't know, Barry. I...

27:19.721 --> 27:22.384
She told me she doesn't believe
in marriage.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.016
I'm not feeling sorry for myself,
I just...

27:26.770 --> 27:28.887
I think that if she loved me
the way I loved her,

27:28.981 --> 27:30.097
she would wanna marry me.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.147
Oliver, I've known Felicity
for five years.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.692
And I'm here to tell you,
as sure as I'm standing here,

27:34.778 --> 27:36.861
- she loves you.
- Felicity...

27:36.947 --> 27:38.904
- I appreciate that, guys.
- Just turn.

outside Danville.

All right. We'll get the band
back together.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.535
Yeah.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.376
- Oliver...
- It's okay.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.754
We can talk when I'm back.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.253
Right now I need to have my head
in the game.

the sub-light generator,

into some kind of super-weapon.
