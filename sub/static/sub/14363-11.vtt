WEBVTT

00:05.554 --> 00:07.801
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:08.831 --> 00:10.884
Oh, my God.

00:12.388 --> 00:14.520
Really? No one's even gonna say, "what?"

00:14.965 --> 00:18.459
Pam Staggs just Facebook friended me.

00:18.460 --> 00:20.361
Pam freakin' Staggs!

00:20.362 --> 00:21.273
Who's Pam Staggs?

00:21.930 --> 00:23.522
She's that "Wheel of Fortune" lady

00:23.522 --> 00:24.639
your mom went to high school with.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.919
She's not just the
"Wheel of Fortune" lady, Mike.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.089
She won a million dollars!

00:30.090 --> 00:33.272
She solved "pardon my French"
with just a "p" and an "r."

00:33.273 --> 00:35.254
And I thought it was, "purell my friend."

00:35.255 --> 00:37.044
I know she moved to St. Louis,

00:37.045 --> 00:38.426
but then I didn't hear a thing after that.

00:38.427 --> 00:40.197
- This close to not asking.
- Like, I couldn't make the first move.

00:40.198 --> 00:41.479
- Yeah.
- She's Pam Staggs!

00:41.480 --> 00:45.327
And now she has friended me. Me, Mike, me!

00:45.328 --> 00:47.155
You do realize you're an adult now?

00:47.156 --> 00:48.877
Mom, Dad.

00:48.878 --> 00:50.415
You are not gonna believe this.

00:50.416 --> 00:51.199
Wait, me first.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.110
How long should I wait before I accept

00:53.111 --> 00:54.306
a Facebook friend request?

00:54.307 --> 00:56.382
Oh, you gotta jump on that.
It could've been a mistake.

00:56.383 --> 00:57.529
Good thinking.

00:57.530 --> 00:58.417
Anyway...

00:58.418 --> 00:59.837
I was perusing KicklnltTenstyle's

00:59.838 --> 01:02.298
sister web site...
KicklnltCollegeStyle.com...

01:02.299 --> 01:05.066
and I learned some very life-changing intel

01:05.066 --> 01:08.328
on a surefire way to get into
the university of your choice.

01:08.329 --> 01:11.161
One word... oboe.

01:11.930 --> 01:13.882
Five words... you don't play the oboe.

01:13.883 --> 01:15.293
Don't worry, you guys. I got this.

01:15.294 --> 01:17.936
These universities need
to fill their oboe needs,

01:17.937 --> 01:20.032
and that is where Sue Heck comes in.

01:26.351 --> 01:28.552
Whoo! Feelin' kinda dizzy.

01:28.553 --> 01:30.297
Head between knees.

01:37.656 --> 01:40.297
Whoa, Devin, what up? You wanna hit a movie?

01:40.298 --> 01:41.823
- Busy.
- Come over later. Watch the game.

01:41.824 --> 01:43.939
- Can't.
- You hungry? I'm famous for my toast.

01:43.940 --> 01:45.412
- Pole.
- Whoa.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.913
All right, fine, I'll just keep
walking backwards around campus.

01:47.914 --> 01:48.922
This could be a date right here.

01:48.923 --> 01:49.963
- Except it's not.
- Why not?

01:49.964 --> 01:51.316
We went out, had a great
time, I don't get it.

01:51.317 --> 01:52.647
Is there someone else? Am I hideous to you?

01:52.648 --> 01:54.015
Look, I like you, Axl.

01:54.016 --> 01:56.107
I'm just not sure I can
do this whole dating thing.

01:56.108 --> 01:58.744
I have soccer practice every
day, and my grades suck.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.600
Mine suck, too. That's another
thing we have in common.

02:00.601 --> 02:02.252
We're like those two characters
from that book we never read.

02:02.253 --> 02:04.288
Why isn't this happening? Oh, my God.

02:04.289 --> 02:05.966
Maybe you do think I'm hideous.

02:05.967 --> 02:09.193
Yeah, I do. You disgust
me. I can't stand blue eyes,

02:09.193 --> 02:10.785
especially when they have
that stupid gold fleck

02:10.786 --> 02:11.438
in the corner.

02:11.439 --> 02:13.311
Your thick curly hair makes me wanna heave,

02:13.312 --> 02:14.521
and I hate your smile.

02:14.522 --> 02:15.664
You smile like you're embarrassed,

02:15.665 --> 02:16.895
you look down like you're shy,
and it makes me wanna kiss you,

02:16.896 --> 02:18.704
and I don't really want to want
to kiss anybody right now, okay?

02:18.705 --> 02:21.742
You can get that, can't you? Jeez.

02:29.678 --> 02:31.232
You take away my noisy toys

02:31.233 --> 02:32.979
and this, you're allowing?

02:33.506 --> 02:35.728
Very inconsistent
parenting, is all I'm saying.

02:37.816 --> 02:39.314
Hey, don't wreck your dinner.

02:39.315 --> 02:41.318
I've got pizza poppers in the microwave.

02:41.647 --> 02:42.652
You need help with that?

02:42.653 --> 02:45.102
No, that's okay. This one's on me.

02:45.103 --> 02:47.593
Ugh, literally.

02:47.594 --> 02:50.584
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.238 --> 03:03.947
Oh, come on!

03:07.643 --> 03:08.829
Frankie?

03:08.830 --> 03:10.735
Frankie Spence?

03:11.479 --> 03:12.839
Pam?

03:13.307 --> 03:15.095
What are you doin' here?

03:15.096 --> 03:17.882
Didn't you hear? I'm back, baby.

03:17.883 --> 03:20.600
Pam Staggs is back!

03:21.673 --> 03:25.423
Help! Pam Staggs is here!
Right outside, right now!

03:25.424 --> 03:27.298
She's parking down the street.

03:27.299 --> 03:28.621
I think I bought us a few minutes.

03:28.622 --> 03:30.789
If she asks, the curbs are being painted.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.614
Oh, my God. Somebody do something!

03:32.615 --> 03:34.366
It's a shantytown in here!

03:34.367 --> 03:38.755
Brick! Put on the news or something
that makes us look smarter!

03:39.275 --> 03:42.942
Stuff a sock in it, Sue!
Somebody cover the sinkhole.

03:42.943 --> 03:45.527
Why do I have to do everything around here?!

03:45.528 --> 03:48.076
When are you people gonna learn
to clean up after yourselves?!

03:48.632 --> 03:49.995
What's going on?

03:49.996 --> 03:53.462
Nothing good in this dump!
Get that hose out the window!

03:53.463 --> 03:56.011
All right.

03:56.012 --> 03:59.056
Change everything, clean
the tub, be different!

04:00.331 --> 04:01.181
Hey there, Pam.

04:01.182 --> 04:02.523
Such a pleasure to have you stop by.

04:02.524 --> 04:03.589
Come in, come in.

04:06.876 --> 04:08.793
- Well...
- Wow.

04:08.794 --> 04:10.224
This is cray cray, huh?

04:10.225 --> 04:12.426
I mean, I'm driving around
checking out the old hood,

04:12.427 --> 04:14.371
and, at first, I thought this homeless woman

04:14.372 --> 04:17.283
was picking through the trash,
and then I realized, oh, my God,

04:17.284 --> 04:19.857
that's not some bag lady.
That's Frankie Spence!

04:21.414 --> 04:24.808
Oh, this is my husband Mike.
He's president of the quarry.

04:24.809 --> 04:26.128
Anybody that wants a rock blown up,

04:26.129 --> 04:27.327
they gotta ask this guy first.

04:27.328 --> 04:30.225
And this is my youngest,
Brick, he reads. He's a reader.

04:30.226 --> 04:30.959
Show her your books.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.173
Oh, and this is my daughter
Sue. She plays the oboe.

04:33.174 --> 04:34.672
Don't play now. We don't wanna show off.

04:34.673 --> 04:37.990
I'm sorry my oldest son, Axl,
isn't here. He's very handsome.

04:37.991 --> 04:39.752
He's at college on a football scholarship.

04:39.753 --> 04:41.370
That's true. I mean, of course it's true.

04:41.371 --> 04:43.887
It's all true.

04:43.888 --> 04:45.740
Wow, Frankie, look at you.

04:45.741 --> 04:47.891
You just have hardly changed.

04:47.892 --> 04:49.443
Oh, yeah, you're just saying that.

04:49.444 --> 04:50.662
You're the one that hasn't changed.

04:50.663 --> 04:52.294
- Our kitchen's being remodeled.
- You know what?

04:52.295 --> 04:55.851
You and I are gonna go
out right now. Shut up!

04:55.852 --> 04:58.942
Because I will not take no for an answer.

04:58.943 --> 05:00.567
Is that okay, Mike?

05:00.568 --> 05:02.450
Can I borrow your wife for a bit?

05:02.451 --> 05:04.116
I'll do you one better. You can keep her.

05:04.117 --> 05:05.738
He does that.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.909
We joke about our love all the time.

05:08.172 --> 05:10.005
- Calm down.
- You calm down.

05:10.006 --> 05:12.412
Okay, then.
Well, I guess that's the plan.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.980
These two gals are hitting the town.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.166
So just put my pizza
poppers in the fridge, guys,

05:16.167 --> 05:18.123
'cause I'm going out
with Pam Staggs.

05:18.124 --> 05:19.242
Nice to meet you.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.407
My glass is empty, Kevin.

05:32.408 --> 05:34.298
You promised me this wasn't gonna happen.

05:35.209 --> 05:39.151
Oh, my God, Frankie. You
forget what Orson's like.

05:39.152 --> 05:41.207
- Yeah.
- It's so much slower.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.626
Everything moves fast in St. Louis.

05:43.627 --> 05:46.293
I mean, if you don't get
into T.G.I. Fridays by 6:00,

05:46.294 --> 05:47.155
you're not getting in.

05:47.156 --> 05:49.695
Anyway, what were we talking about?

05:49.696 --> 05:50.389
The "Wheel."

05:50.390 --> 05:52.212
You know what? I'm tired
of talking about the "Wheel"

05:52.213 --> 05:54.803
anymore and all the money I won
from solving "pardon my French"

05:54.804 --> 05:55.864
with only two letters.

05:55.865 --> 05:58.145
- Let's talk about us!
- Mm.

05:58.146 --> 05:59.847
We didn't have any classes together, did we?

05:59.848 --> 06:01.095
Oh, I don't really remember... seven...

06:01.096 --> 06:03.069
history, english, biology...

06:03.070 --> 06:05.801
Oh! So we both had Mr. Todd for biology.

06:05.802 --> 06:07.393
"Todd The Bod."

06:07.394 --> 06:09.558
Did he hit on you? 'Cause
he hit on all the girls.

06:10.006 --> 06:11.692
No, he didn't hit on me.

06:11.693 --> 06:13.073
But I sat in the back of the class, so...

06:13.074 --> 06:17.278
Oh! Remember that wild
party Nick Saltzman had

06:17.279 --> 06:20.285
where we all had to run away from the cops?

06:20.631 --> 06:22.661
I don't recall being invited to that.

06:22.662 --> 06:24.303
- But I think I had mono anyway.
- Oh.

06:24.304 --> 06:28.014
Kevin, is this drink gonna be better?

06:28.015 --> 06:29.630
I feel good about it.

06:29.631 --> 06:35.433
Mm, well, if you feel good, then I feel good.

06:35.993 --> 06:39.304
Yeah, Kevin, it better be good,
or I'm gonna tell your Mom.

06:39.305 --> 06:42.563
I know his Mom.
We joined curves together.

06:42.564 --> 06:44.870
Anyway, you know what?

06:44.871 --> 06:46.121
You haven't told me about your husband.

06:46.122 --> 06:46.947
What does he do?

06:46.948 --> 06:48.859
Uh, let's see, he gets half my winnings.

06:48.860 --> 06:49.922
We're divorced.

06:49.923 --> 06:51.357
Ooh, I'm so sorry. I...

06:51.358 --> 06:52.353
No, it's way better.

06:52.354 --> 06:55.180
We're... you know, we're
great. We're still best friends.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.881
And our son is in South America,
and he's helping the locals

06:57.882 --> 07:00.256
start a system of sustainable agriculture.

07:00.257 --> 07:01.464
Yeah.

07:02.662 --> 07:03.978
Mmm!

07:04.578 --> 07:06.443
Kevin! Get over here!

07:07.874 --> 07:10.783
This isn't good, Kevy, and my friend here

07:10.784 --> 07:14.808
has yet to taste a real St. Louis Melon Ball.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.724
You know what? Watch out. I'm coming over.

07:17.725 --> 07:19.760
You know, we're gonna be spending

07:19.761 --> 07:21.779
a lot of time here, Kevin.

07:21.780 --> 07:25.468
And we need our Melon Balls to be made right.

07:25.469 --> 07:27.860
Frankie, no! You spit that out right now.

07:27.861 --> 07:28.952
That's the bad one.

07:33.294 --> 07:36.469
So, Dad, I picked this up in
the free bin at the library,

07:36.470 --> 07:38.433
and I thought you and Mom
might find it very interesting.

07:38.434 --> 07:40.521
It's called "Far Out Parenting."

07:40.522 --> 07:42.693
It was written in the '70s,
but I think it still applies.

07:42.694 --> 07:44.863
Just substitute "flip-flops"
for "go-go boots,"

07:44.864 --> 07:45.866
and "oboe" for "drugs."

07:45.867 --> 07:48.426
Put it in the john. Maybe I'll check it out.

07:48.427 --> 07:52.823
Wow, ooh, oh, wow, wow.

07:53.350 --> 07:55.825
Ooh! Crazy night.

07:55.826 --> 07:59.103
Crazy, crazy night.

08:00.987 --> 08:03.729
Really? Nothing?

08:03.730 --> 08:06.726
Does nobody around here
care about my life at all?

08:06.727 --> 08:08.163
I saw the end of the night.

08:08.164 --> 08:10.731
I think I can connect the
dots on how you got there.

08:10.732 --> 08:13.706
So listen, this hose water is really
making this coffee taste weird.

08:13.707 --> 08:16.072
I was thinking we should...

08:16.073 --> 08:19.009
- Mm, oh, hang on a second. It's Pam.
- Mm.

08:19.010 --> 08:25.446
Was... Totally
in, period, sane, period.

08:26.510 --> 08:27.850
All right,
sorry, what were you saying?

08:27.851 --> 08:30.224
I'm saying we need to do
something about the sink situation.

08:30.225 --> 08:32.118
It's freezing out there. We're losing heat.

08:32.119 --> 08:33.207
No, Sue, no.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.650
No oboe today. My head can't take it.

08:36.013 --> 08:38.722
Honestly, I'm losing faith in my ability

08:38.724 --> 08:40.861
to master the oboe in the time required.

08:40.861 --> 08:42.631
But doesn't matter,

08:42.631 --> 08:44.890
because what I heard what
colleges are really looking for

08:44.891 --> 08:46.914
are girls who do rowing.

08:47.766 --> 08:49.097
But you don't do rowing.

08:49.098 --> 08:50.405
No, but...

08:50.406 --> 08:52.324
I have been working on my upper arm strength,

08:52.325 --> 08:55.013
and I think I could be really good at it.

08:55.014 --> 08:57.901
Look at this.  If
I were in a boat right now,

08:57.902 --> 08:59.396
I'd be, like, a hundred feet away.

09:02.271 --> 09:03.679
Is there room for two in that boat?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.870
Okay, change of plans.

09:05.871 --> 09:07.783
Mike, put my egg pockets back in the freezer.

09:07.784 --> 09:09.197
I'm going to brunch with Pam Staggs.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.296
Look! Mike!

09:15.297 --> 09:16.839
Aren't these pretty?

09:16.840 --> 09:19.533
They're from the Chico's in Santa Fe.

09:19.534 --> 09:24.010
Pam Staggs gave them to me
just 'cause I said I liked them.

09:24.011 --> 09:26.003
Well, maybe next time,

09:26.004 --> 09:27.605
you can tell her you like her sink.

09:28.941 --> 09:30.915
You're so funny.

09:30.916 --> 09:35.529
- All right, go to sleep. Sleepy, sleepy...
- Okay.

09:40.434 --> 09:42.323
Here's the thing
about trying to date a girl

09:42.324 --> 09:45.742
who's a lot like you...
you know her weaknesses.

09:45.743 --> 09:47.011
Quick game of horse. One game.

09:47.012 --> 09:48.851
If I win, you go out with me.

09:48.852 --> 09:50.559
If you win... highly doubtful...

09:50.560 --> 09:51.826
I'll leave you alone.

09:51.827 --> 09:53.761
Yeah, not doing that.

09:53.762 --> 09:56.230
Why not? You scared? You
don't think you can beat me?

09:56.231 --> 09:58.067
Uh, no, I know I can beat you.

09:58.068 --> 09:59.556
Well, prove it.

10:00.964 --> 10:02.187
Fine.

10:02.188 --> 10:05.467
Left hand, over the head,
no look, nothing but net.

10:20.273 --> 10:21.296
You know what they say...

10:21.297 --> 10:23.301
if at first you don't
beat a girl in basketball

10:23.302 --> 10:25.546
to win a date, try, try again.

10:26.589 --> 10:28.267
So this is your idea of leaving me alone?

10:28.268 --> 10:30.301
Ooh, somebody likes herself some her.

10:30.302 --> 10:31.896
You think I'm just out
running looking for you?

10:31.897 --> 10:33.738
- I'm training on my
off-season. - Oh, really?

10:33.739 --> 10:35.233
Funny how I've never
seen you out here before.

10:35.887 --> 10:36.920
Yeah. Funny. Race you to the mailbox.

10:36.955 --> 10:38.670
You trying to run away from
that body spray you have on?

10:38.671 --> 10:40.850
It's McConaughey by McConaughey for men.

10:40.851 --> 10:42.049
Then, why are you wearing it?

10:45.226 --> 10:46.845
So, Mike get this,

10:46.846 --> 10:50.230
Pam's house is one of
the Homearama 2014 houses.

10:50.231 --> 10:52.105
You would believe this place.

10:52.106 --> 10:54.203
They've got remote-control window shade

10:54.204 --> 10:57.173
there's a TV in every room,
but there's also a room

10:57.174 --> 10:58.538
just for watching TV.

10:58.539 --> 10:59.800
Frankie, I couldn't care less

10:59.801 --> 11:01.840
if Pam Staggs lives in a big house.

11:01.841 --> 11:03.814
I'm just saying, it's not
the worst thing in the world

11:03.815 --> 11:05.361
to have a millionaire for a best friend.

11:05.362 --> 11:06.846
Yeah, well, I could just use a break

11:06.847 --> 11:09.249
from the constant Pam Staggs updates.

11:09.250 --> 11:12.974
Oh, wow, okay, I get it. Just admit it.

11:12.975 --> 11:14.544
You don't like Pam Staggs.

11:14.545 --> 11:17.899
No, I don't like you when
you're with Pam Staggs.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.736
You act stupid. You act like a big dummy.

11:19.737 --> 11:21.217
Oh, you're a big dummy.

11:21.218 --> 11:23.661
Okay, you're not in high
school anymore, Frankie.

11:23.662 --> 11:26.071
So stop trying to act like you are.

11:26.072 --> 11:27.522
You've been out every night this week.

11:27.523 --> 11:29.799
Well...  I've been breaking rocks

11:29.800 --> 11:31.279
in this prison for 20 years.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.248
I think I've earned a
little time out in the yard.

11:33.249 --> 11:34.906
Wow.

11:35.605 --> 11:37.417
You don't want me to have any fun.

11:37.418 --> 11:39.465
I find that very sad.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.558
I want you to have fun.

11:40.559 --> 11:43.039
I just want you to have
old, married people, Mom fun.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.317
- The kids...
- Oh, don't bring the kids into this.

11:45.318 --> 11:47.066
The kids are older now. They're fine.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.620
I know what the kids are doing every second.

11:48.974 --> 11:49.956
This just isn't you, Frankie.

11:49.957 --> 11:52.299
I don't get why you're twisting yourself

11:52.300 --> 11:53.690
into something that you're not

11:53.691 --> 11:55.991
just to please some crazy
girl from high school.

11:55.992 --> 11:59.484
For your information,
Pam and I are very close.

11:59.485 --> 12:03.012
Who did she seek out when
she came back to Orson? Me.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.741
This is about more than just partying, Mike.

12:04.742 --> 12:06.056
Pam and I have a real connection.

12:06.057 --> 12:10.325
She told me about her divorce,
her uterus... heavy stuff.

12:10.326 --> 12:11.581
I told her stuff, too.

12:11.582 --> 12:12.663
Wait a minute.

12:12.664 --> 12:14.590
You talked about stuff. What stuff?

12:14.591 --> 12:16.784
Just that you were emotionally distant.

12:16.785 --> 12:18.485
But don't worry. I told
her we went to counseling.

12:18.486 --> 12:19.921
You came out sounding very good.

12:19.922 --> 12:21.375
- Frankie!
- What?

12:21.376 --> 12:23.331
She gave me divorce and uterus, Mike.

12:23.332 --> 12:24.314
What was I supposed to give her?

12:24.315 --> 12:26.832
That you don't put the cap back
on the ketchup bottle? Blah.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.345
I had to give her something
of equal or greater value.

12:29.346 --> 12:31.787
Oh, and in case she asks,
during your gambling addiction,

12:31.788 --> 12:33.150
I stayed for a month at my Mom's,

12:33.151 --> 12:34.656
but now we're closer than ever.

12:34.657 --> 12:36.915
Oh! I gotta go change. I'm meeting Pam.

12:36.916 --> 12:39.969
- Again?
- It's ladies drink free, Mike.

12:39.970 --> 12:41.642
I could stay here and drink our beer,

12:41.643 --> 12:42.860
and then we'd be losing money.

12:42.861 --> 12:44.361
I'll go out, drink some beer,

12:44.362 --> 12:46.325
and then like a mama bird, I will come home

12:46.326 --> 12:47.430
and spit in your mouth.

12:47.431 --> 12:48.831

13:19.022 --> 13:22.413
'cause believe me, I had called everybody,

13:22.414 --> 13:24.898
and I mean, everybody I liked in high school,

13:24.899 --> 13:26.329
and they've all moved.

13:27.233 --> 13:30.440
I guess everyone else left Orson

13:30.441 --> 13:32.143
to pursue their dreams but you.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.110
Oh, wait, here's the solo part.

13:46.404 --> 13:47.727
What?

13:47.728 --> 13:50.849
4-H. It's an organization for teens.

13:50.850 --> 13:52.346
It's something to do with agriculture,

13:52.347 --> 13:54.253
and you have to grow crops and stuff.

13:54.254 --> 13:56.098
Oh, yeah, and I might
have to raise an animal.

13:56.099 --> 13:57.739
Why would you wanna do that?

13:57.740 --> 14:01.910
Because everybody's caught on to
the whole oboe and rowing thing,

14:01.911 --> 14:04.222
but 4-H is kind of under
the radar these days.

14:04.223 --> 14:06.373
Yeah, but are you really
that interested in farming?

14:06.374 --> 14:08.384
Dad, just don't talk. You don't get it.

14:08.385 --> 14:09.531
Gladly.

14:15.270 --> 14:17.678
I gotta say, Brick,

14:17.679 --> 14:19.053
you're annoying me the least this week.

14:19.054 --> 14:20.417
Thanks, Dad.

14:20.418 --> 14:22.548
I know we don't always share
a lot of the same interests,

14:22.549 --> 14:24.199
but I think we're both very calm.

14:39.438 --> 14:41.206
Frankie, where were you?

14:41.827 --> 14:43.823
I thought we were supposed
to meet at Suds and Duds.

14:43.824 --> 14:46.558
You know, you don't have
to do laundry to drink.

14:46.559 --> 14:47.857
Yeah, Pam, I don't think...

14:47.858 --> 14:49.506
Oh, my God, are you mad at me?

14:49.507 --> 14:52.267
You're mad at me. You
got so quiet at karaoke.

14:52.268 --> 14:54.250
That thing I said... it just came out wrong.

14:54.251 --> 14:57.008
What I meant to say was, I
called all my real friends,

14:57.009 --> 14:58.290
and they had all moved.

14:58.291 --> 15:01.415
So thank goodness, you never
followed any of your dreams!

15:01.416 --> 15:05.120
Come on. Don't be mad at Peaches.

15:05.121 --> 15:08.233
Pam, it's not just that.
You know, I'm a little tired.

15:08.234 --> 15:10.190
- I got the kids and...
- Of course!

15:10.191 --> 15:11.743
Ugh, what was I thinking?

15:11.744 --> 14:33.655
We'll stay in!

14:33.656 --> 15:17.562
That's why I always bring purse wine. Whoo!

15:29.222 --> 15:31.351
- Boom.
- Seriously?

15:31.352 --> 15:32.593
Is there anything you're not good at?

15:32.594 --> 15:35.099
Word searches. I get way too frustrated.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.048
8-ball, corner pocket, for the win.

15:40.486 --> 15:41.359
Oh, my God.

15:42.168 --> 15:46.960
You scratched. I win! I win!  Loser!

15:46.961 --> 15:48.865
Of course, it's not really a loss

15:48.866 --> 15:49.884
'cause you get me.

15:50.554 --> 15:52.799
Wait a minute. Did you
just do that on purpose?

15:52.800 --> 15:53.693
Did you just let me win?

15:54.667 --> 15:55.954
You'll never know.

15:59.478 --> 16:02.070
Pick me up at 8:00. No body spray.

16:03.898 --> 16:06.787
All right, all right, all right.

16:11.439 --> 16:12.723
What are you doing?

16:13.134 --> 16:14.508
Oh, I had to get out of there.

16:14.509 --> 16:15.662
I don't know what's worse,

16:15.663 --> 16:17.028
your Mom going out with Pam Staggs,

16:17.029 --> 16:18.758
or your Mom staying in with Pam Staggs.

16:18.759 --> 16:22.078
I was hiding at the library.
I thought she'd be gone by now.

16:22.079 --> 16:23.656
Yeah, well, she's not.

16:25.169 --> 16:27.567

16:42.415 --> 16:44.519
It's not fun by myself.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.425
Yeah, you know, Pam, I'm not really in the...

16:46.426 --> 16:48.149
Oh, oh, I've got a great idea.

16:48.150 --> 16:50.932
Let's prank call Gary Pope, remember him?

16:50.933 --> 16:52.533
Yeah, he died.

16:52.534 --> 16:53.694
Oh.

16:54.011 --> 16:57.855
Well, here's to Gary. Gary! Gary!

16:57.856 --> 17:00.475
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary.

17:00.476 --> 17:02.019
Pam, this is really fun and all,

17:02.020 --> 17:03.773
but tomorrow's a workday,

17:03.774 --> 17:05.520
and most of us have to go to work.

17:05.521 --> 17:07.251
We didn't all win a million dollars.

17:07.252 --> 17:08.338
Yeah, but I did.

17:08.743 --> 17:11.292
Seriously, Frankie, if
you do go to work tomorrow,

17:11.294 --> 17:13.567
how much would you make? Why
don't I just write you a check?

17:13.568 --> 17:14.805
That is tempting,

17:14.806 --> 17:16.761
but tomorrow's the day I get to clean out

17:16.762 --> 17:19.539
- the saliva ejector...
- Oh, no. We're out of fun juice.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.723
Ugh, we gotta make a booze run.

17:21.724 --> 17:22.830
Where's the young one?

17:22.832 --> 17:25.681
Does he drive? I mean, I'll run in.

17:25.682 --> 17:27.986
You know, Pam, maybe this is a sign

17:27.987 --> 17:29.959
we should be winding things down a bit.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.396
Oh, isn't that great?

17:31.397 --> 17:33.480
Here, I want you to keep
it. Here, it's yours.

17:33.481 --> 17:35.475
Pam, you can't just keep
giving me your stuff.

17:35.476 --> 17:36.751
- No, come on, take it.
- Yeah, I don't want it.

17:36.752 --> 17:38.060
- Just take it.
- I don't...

17:38.061 --> 17:41.679
Mike, she won't dance with me
and she won't take my speaker.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.798
Okay.

17:42.799 --> 17:44.782
But you'll dance with me, won't you?

17:48.475 --> 17:50.911
Oh, you're so sweaty.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.877
I love me some salty snacks.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.410
Frankie.

18:02.009 --> 18:05.300
What are you doing?

18:05.301 --> 18:08.318
You just licked my husband.

18:08.319 --> 18:12.321
Look, I don't know how
they do things in St. Louis,

18:12.322 --> 18:15.203
but around here, we don't
lick each other's husbands.

18:15.204 --> 18:16.449
We just don't.

18:16.450 --> 18:19.490
I don't care if you are Pam Staggs.

18:19.491 --> 18:22.131
People don't exist just for you
to call them when you're bored,

18:22.132 --> 18:25.140
or back up your karaoke,
or loan you their lipstick

18:25.141 --> 18:26.295
so you can write your phone number

18:26.296 --> 18:27.565
on Kevin's windshield.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.007
What the hell is wrong with you?!

18:29.847 --> 18:31.671
A lot of things.

18:32.942 --> 18:37.209
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

18:37.210 --> 18:40.308
I don't know what's the matter with me!

18:40.309 --> 18:45.652
I...My life is such a mess! I'm such a mess!

18:47.675 --> 18:50.259
You know my whole life,
people always tried to put me

18:50.260 --> 18:54.477
way up here on one of those... Thingies,

18:54.478 --> 18:55.988
what do you call them? Those high things?

18:55.989 --> 18:57.935
- Pedestals?
- Yeah, those!

18:57.936 --> 19:00.305
But I-I don't belong up there.

19:00.306 --> 19:04.963
I belong down here because I am not perfect!

19:04.964 --> 19:07.151
You know, I had to move here from St. Louis

19:07.152 --> 19:08.922
because my husband left me.

19:08.923 --> 19:11.951
And he didn't even have
the decency to cheat on me.

19:11.952 --> 19:14.243
He just didn't wanna be with me.

19:14.244 --> 19:16.407
And my son...

19:17.778 --> 19:20.980
Yeah, he's in South America, all right...

19:22.741 --> 19:24.568
Growing pot!

19:25.359 --> 19:29.493
Oh, you have no idea what a
burden this money is, Frankie.

19:29.494 --> 19:32.137
You are so lucky that you have nothing.

19:32.138 --> 19:36.668
Don't you think that I
would love to dye my hair

19:36.669 --> 19:39.273
in my bathroom like you do and then ride off

19:39.274 --> 19:42.055
into the sunset with my salty husband?

19:42.056 --> 19:44.590
Because I would, and I'd do it in a second.

19:44.591 --> 19:46.955
Another thing, you know,

19:46.956 --> 19:49.827
the only thing Pat Sajak said to me was,

19:50.797 --> 19:52.950
"you're standing in my light."

19:53.265 --> 19:55.050
I lied.

19:55.051 --> 19:58.105
I'm a liar.

19:58.106 --> 20:04.240
I'm just a beautiful...
Wealthy liar!

20:04.854 --> 20:07.631
Pam, I-I am so sorry.

20:07.632 --> 20:09.839
I honestly had no idea.

20:09.840 --> 20:13.508
Oh, you've got a little snot thingie here.

20:13.509 --> 20:16.076
I'll get you a Kleenex.

20:24.828 --> 20:27.079
She's miserable, Mike.

20:27.411 --> 20:30.333
Pam Staggs is miserable!

20:30.334 --> 20:31.913
Her life is horrible!

20:31.914 --> 20:34.459
She wants what I have. Can you believe it?

20:34.460 --> 20:37.253
She wishes she was me!

20:38.947 --> 20:42.761
I guess it's true what they
say, money doesn't buy happiness.

20:42.762 --> 20:44.433
Not that being poor does either.

20:44.434 --> 20:48.470
But when you think about it, our
family really does have it all goin' on.

20:55.064 --> 20:56.919
Have you seen my Mom?

20:57.369 --> 21:02.328
And as for sad, pathetic Pam? Well, I
didn't see her much after that night.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.930
But I did hear she started
dating the real estate guy

21:04.931 --> 21:06.555
who sold her Homearama home.

21:09.381 --> 21:13.233
Me? I wouldn't trade places for the world.

21:13.234 --> 21:15.324
Because, pardon my French...

21:15.325 --> 21:18.221
I am Frankie freakin' Heck.
