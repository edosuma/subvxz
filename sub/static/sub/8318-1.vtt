01:07.208 --> 01:08.641
Madeline!

01:18.686 --> 01:20.620
Got ya.

01:39.841 --> 01:44.278
In an old house in Paris
that was covered in vines...

01:44.345 --> 01:46.375
lived 12 little girls...

01:46.448 --> 01:49.242
in two straight lines.

01:49.617 --> 01:52.950
In two straight lines
they broke their bread...

01:53.755 --> 01:56.089
and brushed their teeth...

01:57.258 --> 01:58.816
and went to bed.

02:00.361 --> 02:02.151
They smiled at the good...

02:04.465 --> 02:07.093
and frowned at the bad.

02:11.839 --> 02:16.367
And sometimes they were very sad.

02:20.615 --> 02:23.743
They left the house at half past nine...

02:23.818 --> 02:26.878
in two straight lines...

02:26.954 --> 02:28.285
in rain...

02:28.356 --> 02:30.290
or shine.

02:32.794 --> 02:36.560
The smallest one was Madeline.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.934
What do you think?

02:42.570 --> 02:45.232
It's great.
You've really captured it.

02:45.306 --> 02:47.297
- Madeline!
- Au revoir.

02:49.811 --> 02:52.974
The circus is coming!

02:53.047 --> 02:54.480
Come! Come!

02:54.549 --> 02:57.017
Come one, come all!

02:57.085 --> 03:00.020
See the Idiots Popopov!

03:00.088 --> 03:02.579
Experience the depths of terror...

03:02.657 --> 03:07.287
at the sight of the man-eating tiger!

03:08.029 --> 03:10.224
To the tiger in the zoo,
Madeline just said...

03:10.298 --> 03:11.731
Pooh-pooh!

03:14.936 --> 03:19.664
And nobody knew so well
how to frighten Miss Clavel.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.343
Get down!

03:26.481 --> 03:28.073
Take that!

03:32.720 --> 03:35.280
Bless Lady Covington...

03:35.356 --> 03:38.291
and protect her
that she may recover quickly...

03:43.564 --> 03:47.193
And bless this food
we are about to receive to our use...

03:48.269 --> 03:50.464
and us to Thy service.

03:53.741 --> 03:55.800
Amen.

03:59.547 --> 04:01.879
Chicken Helene.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.180
Good night, little girls.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.741
Thank the Lord you are well.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.549
And now go to sleep.

04:40.621 --> 04:43.215
Good night, good night, Miss Clavel.

04:48.062 --> 04:51.429
Elizabeth, Veronica, Sylvette...

04:51.499 --> 04:54.627
Marie-Odile, Serena, Beatrice...

04:54.702 --> 04:57.535
Lucinda, Chantal, Lolo...

04:57.605 --> 05:01.041
Victoria, Aggie and Madeline.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.445
Especially Madeline.

05:08.616 --> 05:10.049
Amen.

05:34.075 --> 05:37.567
Something is not right.

05:43.484 --> 05:45.247
Madeline's burning up!

05:46.153 --> 05:48.087
Should we call the fire department?

05:48.155 --> 05:50.248
No, Chantal.
"Burning up" is a metaphor.

05:50.324 --> 05:52.884
Like " Chantal is thick
as a plank."

05:52.960 --> 05:54.791
- Victoria.
- That's a simile.

05:54.862 --> 05:58.127
- Go get Helene. Now.
- Ooh, my tummy!

05:58.199 --> 06:00.133
She must've eaten something
super horrid!

06:00.201 --> 06:01.828
We all ate the same thing!

06:01.903 --> 06:04.770
- That means we're all gonna die!
- Girls, that's enough.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.564
My hat! Where's my hat?

06:31.632 --> 06:33.361
Girls, find Madeline's hat!

06:33.434 --> 06:35.368
I'll check.

06:41.342 --> 06:44.675
Where is it?
Think like a hat.

06:44.745 --> 06:46.679
I'm a hat.

06:54.655 --> 06:56.452
- Hurry up!
- Come on, everybody!

06:56.524 --> 06:58.321
Found it! We found it!

07:19.480 --> 07:21.505
Hold it very tightly.
That's good.

07:23.284 --> 07:25.218
I think they'll have
to take out her appendix.

07:25.286 --> 07:28.687
- My appendix?
- No, you'll be fine. She'll be fine.

07:28.756 --> 07:30.781
- Just please don't hurt me!
- Just repeat atter me, Madeline.

07:30.858 --> 07:32.849
I can do anything.

07:34.695 --> 07:37.027
Only patients from here on, madame.
I'm sorry.

07:37.098 --> 07:39.589
- But I must stay with her!
- Wait!

07:39.667 --> 07:41.191
- Please!
- I'll be right outside!

07:41.268 --> 07:43.532
I can do anything.

07:44.605 --> 07:47.369
- Are you her mother?
- No, I'm not.

07:47.441 --> 07:49.170
I'm her teacher.

07:49.243 --> 07:51.040
And where are her parents?

07:51.112 --> 07:53.046
She's a ward of the church.
She has no parents.

07:53.114 --> 07:56.845
- They died when she was very small.
- Oh. Here.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.248
I can do anything.

08:14.468 --> 08:18.495
We won't be visiting for long. It's only
been a few days since the operation.

08:18.572 --> 08:21.871
Madeline will be exhausted.

08:21.942 --> 08:23.876
We must be gentle with her.

08:44.799 --> 08:47.893
- Hi, everybody.
- You're okay.

08:47.968 --> 08:50.095
Madeline, you tricked us!

08:50.171 --> 08:51.661
Look at that dollhouse!

08:51.739 --> 08:55.004
- Oh, girls, your flowers.
- Vicki, she's got as many toys as you.

08:55.076 --> 08:59.069
Yes, but these aren't hers.
They're for charity cases.

08:59.146 --> 09:00.477
Look!

09:00.548 --> 09:02.243
- It's a crank!
- Chantal!

09:02.316 --> 09:05.683
- Glad you made it.
- Yes, we were super, super worried.

09:05.753 --> 09:09.189
- Was it scary?
- Did you see a white light?

09:09.256 --> 09:11.622
They cut a three-inch hole in me...

09:11.692 --> 09:15.526
and then they stuck their bare hands in
and pulled out my guts.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.793
- You're so lucky.
- Please.

09:20.034 --> 09:22.935
All right. I was asleep.

09:23.003 --> 09:26.439
So basically, all you did
was take a long nap.

09:26.507 --> 09:29.704
Wait. I haven't shown you
the best part yet.

09:32.513 --> 09:34.606
Look. Come over here.

09:34.682 --> 09:36.980
Come and look.

09:37.051 --> 09:41.044
Look what they gave me
in exchange for my appendix.

09:44.692 --> 09:46.557
It's not that big.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.822
Are you kidding? It's huge!

09:48.896 --> 09:51.330
It's gi-normous!

09:51.398 --> 09:53.559
All right, girls.
We'll say our good-byes now.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.966
Madeline's had a hectic
and sleepless evening.

09:56.036 --> 09:58.630
She's emotionally drained
and needs her rest.

09:58.706 --> 10:00.697
Bye, Madeline.

10:05.379 --> 10:08.177
- Can we visit Lady Covington?
- Not today, Aggie.

10:18.125 --> 10:21.561
Please report to surgery,
room 24 immediately.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.790
Lady Covington?

10:52.693 --> 10:55.457
Hi, there, Madeline.

10:55.529 --> 10:58.930
- You remember me?
- Of course I remember you...

10:58.999 --> 11:01.263
from my visit last Easter.

11:01.335 --> 11:03.269
- Yes.
- Come in.

11:05.306 --> 11:08.400
I heard one of our girls
was in this hospital.

11:10.344 --> 11:11.936
Are you feeling better?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.814
Yes, ma'am.

11:17.785 --> 11:20.253
I hope...

11:20.321 --> 11:22.721
they are giving you
a lot of ice cream.

11:22.790 --> 11:26.385
They are. I hope they're giving you
a lot of ice cream as well.

11:26.460 --> 11:29.054
Not much.

11:29.129 --> 11:33.566
- Are you teeling better?
- Much better.

11:33.634 --> 11:38.936
You know, Madeline,
my grandmother started the school...

11:39.006 --> 11:42.965
and I was a student there myself
when I was a little girl.

11:45.045 --> 11:48.014
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yes.

11:49.083 --> 11:53.315
When I was nine,
on the baseboard in the dortoir...

11:53.387 --> 11:56.584
I carved my name.

11:56.657 --> 11:59.649
You carved "Lady Covington"?

12:01.729 --> 12:05.927
No, my name was Marie Gilbert.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.938
- See if it's still there.
- Marie Gilbert.

12:12.006 --> 12:13.940
Who gave you permission
to be in here?

12:14.008 --> 12:16.772
Nobody, Lord Covington.

12:16.844 --> 12:19.369
This is a hospital.
It's not a playroom.

12:19.446 --> 12:21.471
You're not allowed
to just wander around.

12:21.548 --> 12:23.482
Yes, sir.

12:34.495 --> 12:36.486
Something is not right.

12:49.410 --> 12:51.071
What? What is it?

12:51.145 --> 12:56.208
We want our appendix out too!

12:59.186 --> 13:00.653
Good night, little girls.

13:00.721 --> 13:03.781
Thank the Lord you are well.

13:03.857 --> 13:06.257
Now, please, go to sleep!

13:07.161 --> 13:10.562
Good night, good night, Miss Clavel.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.808
Wait, Miss Clavel.

13:21.875 --> 13:24.241
But that's Lady Covington's room.

13:24.311 --> 13:27.678
Did she get better
and go home as well?

13:27.748 --> 13:29.682
No, Madeline.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.119
Lady Covington...

13:35.656 --> 13:38.682
Lady Covington passed away.

13:40.094 --> 13:41.686
But I only just spoke to her.

13:43.030 --> 13:48.229
She was very sick.
We'll miss her very much.

13:49.803 --> 13:51.737
I'm sorry.

13:58.779 --> 14:00.542
Are you all right?

14:19.166 --> 14:22.465
My first husband was a truck driver.
Stupid man!

14:28.175 --> 14:30.143
What's your name?

14:33.080 --> 14:35.571
Is this a pet chicken?

14:35.649 --> 14:38.482
You know the rule, Madeline.
No pets allowed.

14:39.787 --> 14:42.449
- Then what's it for?
- What is it for?

14:42.523 --> 14:45.617
What do you think it's for, dancing?
It's for eating.

14:45.692 --> 14:47.159
For eating?

14:47.227 --> 14:49.525
In honor of your return, Madeline...

14:49.596 --> 14:51.791
we'll have Chicken Helene.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.805
Enough is enough.

15:24.598 --> 15:28.261
- Hello, street. Hello, house, vines.
- Take care, Madeline.

15:28.335 --> 15:31.930
Madeline, the Spanish ambassador
is moving in next door.

15:36.376 --> 15:38.003
Wait! Hat, wait!

15:48.088 --> 15:49.988
The Spanish ambassador's a midget?

15:51.225 --> 15:53.921
This is Pepito,
the Spanish ambassador's son.

15:59.333 --> 16:03.099
We're off to the races!
No leaving the courtyard!

16:13.113 --> 16:15.104
That boy's bad hat.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.582
No, I don't think you should
judge people too quickly.

16:17.651 --> 16:20.518
But I guess
I understood him quickly.

16:31.498 --> 16:35.901
So you're Pepito, eh?

16:44.511 --> 16:47.002
He's positively Elvis!

16:47.080 --> 16:50.477
Don't give him any attention.
He he's bad hat.

16:50.550 --> 16:53.478
- I like his hat,
- And, Madeline, you're so young.

16:53.653 --> 16:55.444
This boy's got charisma.

16:56.290 --> 16:59.885
- But is he intelligent?
- Who cares? He's got a motorcycle.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.452
- It's a Vespa.
- He'll probably get run over someday.

17:03.530 --> 17:06.021
He is sort of handsome.

17:06.098 --> 17:09.329
Forget it, Aggie.
You don't stand a chance.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.333
Nobody wants a chance, Vicki,
except for you.

17:12.605 --> 17:14.071
"He's got charisma."

17:14.808 --> 17:16.901
You're all googly-eyed.

17:16.977 --> 17:18.874
I am not googly-eyed!

17:19.345 --> 17:21.780
He'll see us!

17:35.929 --> 17:37.362
Amen.

17:40.167 --> 17:44.831
Tonight, Madeline, I made
your very favorite: Chicken Helene.

17:46.873 --> 17:48.636
- Great!
- Oh, super!

17:48.709 --> 17:52.702
- It looks great, Helene.
- Yes.

17:52.779 --> 17:54.713
Smells gorgeous.

17:56.917 --> 17:59.442
Oh, no. Fred.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.454
Who's Fred?

18:03.523 --> 18:04.956
That's Fred.

18:05.025 --> 18:08.483
- The chicken?
- Chickens don't have names.

18:08.562 --> 18:11.326
- How do you know?
- Madeline, aren't you hungry?

18:11.398 --> 18:13.889
I've suddenly lost my appetite.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.527
You see, this chicken
was a friend of mine.

18:16.603 --> 18:21.666
I met him earlier in the car.
I think I'm a vegetarian.

18:21.742 --> 18:24.074
This is just too idiotic.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.739
If you knew the chicken the way I did,
Vicki, you wouldn't eat him.

18:27.814 --> 18:30.681
Of course I would.
He's nice and crispy...

18:30.751 --> 18:32.685
just the way I like him.

18:32.753 --> 18:34.812
Well, I'm not eating Fred.

18:34.888 --> 18:36.913
Fred's already dead. Look.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.823
Well, I think
I'm a "vegetable-arian" too.

18:39.893 --> 18:41.224
I can't eat it either.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.888
What's going on?

18:43.964 --> 18:46.023
Who is Fred? I don't understand.

18:46.099 --> 18:48.397
I'm sorry, Helene,
but you killed him.

18:57.444 --> 19:00.174
Well, I wasn't friends with Fred.

19:25.505 --> 19:28.406
Eat it, Lolo!

19:28.475 --> 19:30.807
Don't be one of them.
Eat it!

19:30.877 --> 19:33.971
Everyone is entitled
to her opinion.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.981
If Vicki wants to eat Fred...

19:36.049 --> 19:37.778
the chicken...

19:44.925 --> 19:46.859
May I ask what's going on?

19:53.166 --> 19:55.726
Excuse us, my lord.

19:55.802 --> 19:58.293
You found us in the middle
of a debate.

19:59.206 --> 20:01.140
A debate.

20:01.208 --> 20:05.201
Miss Clavel, I wonder
if I might have a word with you.

20:11.852 --> 20:15.253
What's Lord Cuckoo Butt doing here?

20:15.322 --> 20:18.519
- Lord Covington.
- Mm-hmm.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.583
On behalf of myself
and the girls...

20:20.660 --> 20:23.185
I would like to offer you
our deepest sympathy.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.663
Thank you very much, Miss Clavel.

20:27.934 --> 20:29.868
The girls.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.138
Yes. I'm afraid
they lack discipline.

20:35.375 --> 20:38.833
They are usually very well-behaved,
it I may say so.

20:38.912 --> 20:42.404
You may say so,
but it is not my experience.

20:42.482 --> 20:45.974
I've been going through
my wife's papers...

20:46.052 --> 20:48.282
putting her final affairs
in order.

20:48.355 --> 20:52.018
This must be a very difficult time
for you.

20:52.092 --> 20:54.424
In 43 years of marriage...

20:56.296 --> 20:59.697
the only thing that my wife and I
ever disagreed upon...

21:01.134 --> 21:03.125
was her indulgence of this school.

21:04.871 --> 21:07.465
It needed a new roof,
my wife wrote a check.

21:08.542 --> 21:12.478
Cook needed a new refrigerator,
my wife wrote a check.

21:12.546 --> 21:15.174
Trips to the zoo.

21:15.248 --> 21:18.046
She was a wondertully
generous woman.

21:18.118 --> 21:20.678
Well, it can't go on like this.

21:22.088 --> 21:23.487
I'm closing the school down.

21:25.559 --> 21:28.255
But the girls.

21:30.096 --> 21:32.360
Will find another school to attend.

21:34.467 --> 21:37.129
Eating chicken's not the same
as wearing leather shoes.

21:37.204 --> 21:38.637
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

21:38.705 --> 21:40.639
End of debate!

21:40.707 --> 21:43.767
If you won't eat your chicken,
it's off to bed with you.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.616
- What did we do?
- No dinner at all?

22:07.267 --> 22:10.236
"Marie Gilbert."

22:10.303 --> 22:13.067
- Who's that?
- A friend of mine.

22:13.139 --> 22:17.235
- I'm super hungry.
- You're "super" everything.

22:17.310 --> 22:21.337
It's better to be super everything
than super nothing.

22:21.414 --> 22:25.145
I don't think I'm super,
super everything.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.278
All right. We're all hungry.

22:28.355 --> 22:30.084
So let's eat.

22:30.156 --> 22:32.351
But we're not allowed.

22:32.425 --> 22:35.087
Pooh-pooh. Come on.

22:36.763 --> 22:39.391
I still don't think
we should do this.

22:42.335 --> 22:47.331
In the French resistance, we knew
how to deal with a man like Cuckoo Face.

22:48.008 --> 22:51.808
Oh, Helene, don't even joke
about such things.

22:51.878 --> 22:54.312
Who is joking?

23:02.355 --> 23:05.449
Shh! If they hear us,
we're dead meat.

23:05.525 --> 23:08.050
- But we're vegetarians.
- Shh! Stop whispering!

23:08.128 --> 23:10.062
You stop whispering!

23:13.800 --> 23:16.432
- It's Helene's knickers.
- It's her bra.

23:16.502 --> 23:18.336
Her booby baskets.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.133
Boobies, boobies, boobies.

23:22.208 --> 23:25.609
- Mmm, pickle sandwiches.
- Are dairy products all right?

23:28.048 --> 23:30.312
Yuck. Super bad smell.

23:30.383 --> 23:32.442
All right, who did it?

23:32.519 --> 23:34.453
- Smells like one of Vicki's.
- I need air.

23:34.521 --> 23:36.148
- Phew!
- Gross!

23:36.222 --> 23:39.453
- Aggie.
- She who smelt it dealt it.

23:39.526 --> 23:43.826
- Chantal.
- It's not me. It's this.

23:43.897 --> 23:46.388
Nobody breathe!
It's Helene's special cheese.

23:46.466 --> 23:50.402
- Close it!
- Give me a Jack!

23:51.871 --> 23:53.805
Go fish!

23:56.242 --> 23:59.040
Chicken Helene. Chicken.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.694
Now what's for dessert?

24:22.936 --> 24:24.335
We can bake a cake.

24:30.777 --> 24:33.405
Come back here, you!
I don't care who your father is.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.574
We're not in Spain.
We're not gonna take this.

24:36.649 --> 24:40.045
If you think you scare me,
well, you don't!

24:46.526 --> 24:50.656
- It is an outrage!
- We were just getting something to eat.

24:53.199 --> 24:55.099
It's all Pepito's fault.

25:11.317 --> 25:13.251
Who's going to clean up this mess?

25:13.319 --> 25:15.480
We are, Miss Clavel.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.955
And then what do you suggest?

25:20.727 --> 25:22.888
We eat!

25:27.967 --> 25:32.495
All right, but from now on
I do the cooking, okay?

25:32.572 --> 25:34.506
Hop, hop!

26:21.554 --> 26:24.089
Hello... A nun!

26:24.690 --> 26:26.790
Leopold's the name.

26:27.260 --> 26:29.518
Tutoring's the game.

26:30.295 --> 26:32.489
I'm Pepito's new tutor.

26:32.565 --> 26:34.890
I'm Miss Clavel
from the school next door.

26:35.735 --> 26:38.295
Pepito appears to be
a handful.

26:38.371 --> 26:41.534
It seems he needs an outlet
for his energy.

26:41.608 --> 26:44.076
Well, we all do, don't we?

26:44.144 --> 26:46.578
I thought he might appreciate this.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.581
It's a toolbox.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.947
Cheers.

26:52.018 --> 26:54.077
Do you mind if we talk
a little shop?

26:54.154 --> 26:57.351
These kids...

26:57.423 --> 27:01.757
What do you do to keep 'em occupied,
out of your hair, so to speak?

27:01.828 --> 27:04.991
Well, tomorrow, for instance,
I'm taking mine to the museum.

27:05.064 --> 27:07.225
The museum.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.200
Not bad.

27:10.436 --> 27:12.097
What do you do on your day off?

27:14.073 --> 27:16.007
I pray.

27:36.529 --> 27:39.589
Despite being rather tiny in size...

27:39.666 --> 27:42.567
Emperor Napoleon held France
in an iron grip.

27:42.635 --> 27:46.332
I don't want you
to simply copy the painting.

27:46.406 --> 27:49.170
I want you to loosen up.

27:49.242 --> 27:52.302
Express yourselves. Go wild.

27:53.780 --> 27:56.544
You have exactly 20 minutes. Draw.

28:02.655 --> 28:05.089
Madeline, where is your drawing pad?

28:05.158 --> 28:08.389
Oops. I left it in the other gallery.

28:09.929 --> 28:11.590
- I know where it is.
- Are you sure?

28:12.899 --> 28:15.299
- Yes.
- Then you may go and retrieve it.

29:06.219 --> 29:09.450
Where are you going, little girl?

29:09.522 --> 29:13.014
I asked you a question.

29:13.092 --> 29:15.686
What's the matter? Scared?

29:16.763 --> 29:18.788
I wasn't scared of you, Pepito.

29:19.732 --> 29:21.290
Were you looking for this?

29:21.367 --> 29:22.891
That's mine!

29:22.969 --> 29:25.802
- Hey, I know it's yours.
- You stole it.

29:25.872 --> 29:29.035
I was gonna give it back. You should
say "thank you," don't you think?

29:29.108 --> 29:31.406
Give it to me.

29:31.477 --> 29:35.345
Keep it down.
Some of us are trying to sleep.

29:36.783 --> 29:38.978
Adios, little girl.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.864
"Beware"?

30:01.941 --> 30:04.535
Beware of what?

30:04.610 --> 30:09.309
Girls, we've received an invitation
from our new neighbor.

30:10.383 --> 30:13.284
"His Excellency,
the Ambassador of Spain...

30:13.353 --> 30:15.548
requests your presence
for atternoon tea...

30:15.621 --> 30:18.089
to celebrate the tenth birthday
of his son."

30:18.157 --> 30:21.354
But we can't go.
The message said "beware"!

30:21.427 --> 30:23.622
It's a trap.
We'll never make it out alive.

30:23.696 --> 30:27.188
Of course we're going.
We never get invited anywhere.

30:27.266 --> 30:29.359
Vicki's right.

30:29.435 --> 30:31.266
We can't let him frighten us off.

30:32.238 --> 30:34.604
- It's only a boy, girls.
- Please, don't go in there!

30:34.674 --> 30:37.108
- But they are beginning a class!
- Excuse me, Miss Clavel.

30:37.176 --> 30:39.406
Now this is the room
that requires some attention.

30:39.479 --> 30:44.212
- May I help you, Lord Covington?
- May I ask you what these marks are?

30:44.283 --> 30:46.649
Those are for keeping track
of the girls' heights.

30:48.321 --> 30:49.913
Paint them over!

30:49.989 --> 30:51.616
Excuse me!

30:53.993 --> 30:56.291
We have just begun our class.

30:56.362 --> 30:59.661
Well, perhaps you'd be kind enough
to reconvene elsewhere, Miss Clavel.

30:59.732 --> 31:01.427
Go on.

31:07.340 --> 31:08.773
Downstairs, girls.

31:08.841 --> 31:11.309
In an orderly fashion.

31:14.814 --> 31:16.782
Ah, young ladies.

31:16.849 --> 31:19.443
Right. You, paint it over.

31:35.435 --> 31:39.428
No matter what you wear, Vicki,
you always look super gorgeous.

31:39.505 --> 31:42.963
You can wear whatever you like
to the party tomorrow.

31:43.042 --> 31:44.669
I know what I'll be wearing.

31:44.744 --> 31:48.680
Don't worry, Miss Clavel.
One of us will look smashing.

31:59.926 --> 32:01.791
Look at my dress.

32:06.933 --> 32:08.366
Girls.

32:18.544 --> 32:19.841
Hello.

32:19.912 --> 32:23.404
Oh, you all look so charming!

32:25.051 --> 32:26.484
Girls.

32:37.230 --> 32:39.562
Slowly. Girls.

32:42.068 --> 32:45.003
Pepito, they're here.

32:46.472 --> 32:51.500
Ladies, may I present the reason
we have opened to you our home.

32:51.577 --> 32:53.738
Our birthday boy...

32:53.813 --> 32:57.510
Señor José Marco
Filippo Juan Franloco...

32:57.583 --> 32:59.050
Lopez de Vega...

32:59.118 --> 33:01.052
Esteban Machado...

33:01.120 --> 33:03.611
Jorge Santiago de la Rocha...

33:03.689 --> 33:06.214
Gaspar Carlos de Fuentes...

33:06.292 --> 33:08.954
Coruna Diego y Sevilla.

33:13.099 --> 33:16.466
Of course,
his friends call him Pepito.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.798
What friends?

33:17.870 --> 33:21.237
Señoritas, you honor me
with your presence.

33:21.307 --> 33:24.276
Your limousine is waiting, sir.

33:24.343 --> 33:26.811
Do excuse us.
I wish we could stay.

33:26.879 --> 33:29.541
- Happy birthday.
- Bye-bye, darling.

33:29.615 --> 33:31.708
- Do you have the tickets?
- Yes.

33:36.789 --> 33:39.656
I think you look
very handsome, Pepito.

33:39.725 --> 33:43.252
But no one told us
this was a costume party.

33:43.329 --> 33:45.388
This is not a costume.

33:45.464 --> 33:48.365
This is the uniform
of a Spanish toreador...

33:48.434 --> 33:52.097
the great heroes
of the coliseums de Madrid.

33:52.171 --> 33:54.105
He's a bullfighter.

33:54.173 --> 33:57.233
Those must be some
pretty small bulls.

33:57.310 --> 34:00.575
Please.
You're not a real bullfighter.

34:02.848 --> 34:06.579
Señoritas, allow me
to show you my menagerie.

34:10.456 --> 34:12.389
What's a menagerie?

34:19.031 --> 34:22.159
You damn idiot!
I'll get him to the circus.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.725
- That's not your concern.
- I don't know.

34:24.804 --> 34:27.864
You just stick with the plan,
and we'll all be rich.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.703
I must talk to my brothers
about this.

34:29.775 --> 34:33.667
Look, no worries, mate.
He's as good as delivered.

34:49.862 --> 34:52.056
Do you happen to know my uncle?

34:52.130 --> 34:54.565
He's the British ambassador
in Madrid.

34:55.668 --> 34:57.795
Is there meant to be a clown
at the party?

34:57.870 --> 35:00.168
The only clown here is you.

35:13.219 --> 35:15.483
What's in there, Pepito?

35:15.554 --> 35:17.749
It's a surprise.

35:24.764 --> 35:26.732
I'm not afraid of mice.

35:26.799 --> 35:29.359
No? Perhaps you're afraid
of the snake...

35:29.435 --> 35:32.495
that's gonna have this mouse
for lunch.

35:33.606 --> 35:36.666
You wouldn't feed a live mouse
to that snake.

35:36.742 --> 35:39.336
Of course not.
That would be cruel.

35:39.412 --> 35:42.074
But what I would do
is execute him...

35:42.148 --> 35:44.116
with the guillotine I built.

35:48.120 --> 35:52.022
It's quick, silent and deadly.

35:52.091 --> 35:54.457
Like Helene's cheese.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.358
It's just an innocent little mouse!

35:58.330 --> 36:00.696
I'll show you!

36:01.667 --> 36:03.134
It was just a joke!

36:09.208 --> 36:11.301
Girls? Girls?

36:16.148 --> 36:18.446
Stupid idiot!

36:21.520 --> 36:23.147
Look.

36:24.724 --> 36:28.626
Come back here! I'll get you!

36:28.694 --> 36:30.924
Drop that rat, bullfighter!

36:30.996 --> 36:33.089
Stop it this instant!

36:33.165 --> 36:37.829
- I'll get you!
- If you can't behave, we're leaving now.

36:44.844 --> 36:46.277
Girls.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.354
What about the cake?

37:18.611 --> 37:21.774
There's only 197.

37:21.847 --> 37:23.781
Begin again.

37:25.317 --> 37:27.114
Thanks a lot, Madeline.

37:28.187 --> 37:30.348
I've never been so humiliated.

37:30.422 --> 37:32.583
Can you believe them?

37:32.658 --> 37:34.387
And that poor carrot.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.985
Trust Madeline to get us all
in trouble.

37:37.062 --> 37:39.462
It was a super bad punishment.

37:39.532 --> 37:40.965
He deserved it.

37:41.033 --> 37:44.833
He was about to kill a live
baby mouse right in front of us.

37:44.904 --> 37:47.668
But he did say he was joking.

37:47.740 --> 37:49.332
Aggie.

37:49.408 --> 37:53.105
What do you think?
I've been praying for inspiration.

37:53.179 --> 37:56.148
- Yes. I can see that.
- You don't like it?

37:56.215 --> 37:59.514
Listen to me.

37:59.585 --> 38:00.950
It's not my fault.

38:01.020 --> 38:04.649
The boy's bad hat.
How can you take his side?

38:04.723 --> 38:07.692
Have you all gone mad?
I did the right thing.

38:07.760 --> 38:10.320
The boy kills bulls.
He kills mice.

38:10.396 --> 38:12.796
- He's a maniac.
- Very interesting.

38:12.865 --> 38:16.357
I'll show that bullfighter,
that mouse-killer.

38:16.435 --> 38:19.029
I'll fight him myself!

38:19.104 --> 38:21.231
- Yes, Aggie.
- Take that, Pepito! And that!

38:33.953 --> 38:36.046
- Look!
- Somebody help her!

38:36.121 --> 38:39.557
- Help!
- The current is taking her!

38:43.729 --> 38:45.594
You can do it!

38:45.664 --> 38:48.462
- Keep your head up!
- Help!

38:53.172 --> 38:55.504
Where is she?

38:58.611 --> 39:00.203
Help!

39:08.120 --> 39:10.850
Follow me! Girls, quickly!

39:12.858 --> 39:15.850
Help!

39:16.929 --> 39:18.362
Quickly!

39:20.165 --> 39:22.258
Not too fast!

39:27.473 --> 39:29.805
- Madeline!
- There's a dog! Look!

39:52.498 --> 39:54.432
Thank you.

40:01.573 --> 40:04.770
Oh, Madeline! Hold on tight.

40:07.313 --> 40:09.679
The dog. Where's the dog?

40:09.748 --> 40:13.013
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.525
I was so scared.

40:30.069 --> 40:32.003
Tea, soup and covers.

40:32.071 --> 40:34.403
I want you to stay under the covers...

40:34.473 --> 40:37.408
eat your soup and drink your tea.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.341
You're giving me gray hair.

40:39.411 --> 40:41.504
- Can I see?
- No!

40:43.749 --> 40:46.309
Stay in bed.

40:46.385 --> 40:48.319
Bye, Madeline.

41:00.566 --> 41:04.559
Miss Clavel, can I stay home tomorrow?
I'm feeling sick.

41:04.636 --> 41:06.900
- No, Aggie.
- Please.

41:09.074 --> 41:12.305
Leopold, where are my keys?

41:21.487 --> 41:24.854
- Could you please find my keys?
- All right. Pipe down.

41:24.923 --> 41:28.017
- Can you or not? I can't start.
- You don't need a bloody key.

41:28.093 --> 41:31.153
- You can use a paper clip. Watch.
- Oh, yeah, right.

41:36.602 --> 41:38.536
It worked.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.623
You found me!

42:01.660 --> 42:04.629
Genevieve. Genevieve.

42:04.696 --> 42:07.859
You found me.
I never thought you would. Thank you.

42:07.933 --> 42:10.766
Well, I think you'll find
it's in immaculate condition.

42:10.836 --> 42:13.566
The house was built in 1852.

42:17.676 --> 42:19.439
It's charming, isn't it?

42:19.511 --> 42:22.537
Property's been in my late wife's family
for generations.

42:22.614 --> 42:24.775
What a place to invite your guests.

42:26.819 --> 42:30.016
- You don't have any children?
- No, just the two of us.

42:30.089 --> 42:33.718
Let's start in the dining room.
If you'd be kind enough to follow me.

42:33.792 --> 42:37.489
The house has been used for the past
few decades as a school for girls.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.661
Hence the sensible furniture.

42:41.733 --> 42:46.227
- What a spacious dining room.
- Oh, such a beautitul portrait.

42:46.305 --> 42:49.604
- Is that your wife?
- It's my late wife, yes.

42:49.675 --> 42:52.269
She was very lovely.

42:52.344 --> 42:54.812
Yes, indeed she was.

42:58.317 --> 43:00.945
Shall we go and have a look
at the kitchen?

43:01.019 --> 43:03.010
It has all the modern conveniences.

43:06.692 --> 43:09.752
Kitchens are my staff's business.
I never set foot in them.

43:09.828 --> 43:12.092
Please, just reassure me
that you have one.

43:12.164 --> 43:16.430
We have one.
Now this room speaks for itself.

43:16.502 --> 43:18.629
The music room.

43:18.704 --> 43:22.140
Yes, I think you'll agree
it has an air of real sophistication.

43:23.408 --> 43:27.367
- Splendid.
- So, upstairs?

43:27.446 --> 43:29.676
And have a look at these doors.

43:29.748 --> 43:32.512
Solid oak.
They don't make them like this anymore.

43:34.920 --> 43:37.013
Now.

43:37.089 --> 43:42.049
And so we arrive at yet another room
with the most elegant proportions.

43:42.127 --> 43:44.061
Think how splendid it'll be...

43:44.129 --> 43:47.121
to see the Liberian flag
fluttering out of that window.

43:47.199 --> 43:48.632
Indeed.

43:48.700 --> 43:50.793
Well, Lord Covington,
I see nothing to prevent us...

43:50.869 --> 43:53.667
from purchasing
this magniticent house.

43:55.874 --> 43:57.808
Did you hear something, Desmond?

43:59.645 --> 44:03.103
I can assure you,
the neighborhood is uniquely peaceful.

44:03.182 --> 44:05.207
What is that sound?

44:10.556 --> 44:11.887
That boy down there!

44:15.093 --> 44:16.890
The Spanish ambassador's son.

44:19.331 --> 44:22.926
We had a terrible little boy
next door to us in Ouagadougou.

44:24.403 --> 44:27.099
The worst three years of my life.

44:27.172 --> 44:30.938
He never slept.
Not ever.

44:31.009 --> 44:33.443
I'm sorry.
This just won't work.

44:33.512 --> 44:35.946
I should warn you
that I've had inquiries...

44:36.014 --> 44:39.108
from a number
of other foreign diplomats.

44:39.184 --> 44:41.618
Under no circumstances.
Never again.

44:41.687 --> 44:44.087
I'll get rid of the boy.
He's a pest.

44:44.156 --> 44:46.090
I'll speak to the Spanish government.

44:56.868 --> 45:00.895
Did you know that Joan of Arc was burned
at the stake when she was only 19?

45:00.973 --> 45:04.306
Girls, vite, vite.
Now go to bed.

45:04.376 --> 45:06.867
Listen, everybody.
I have something to tell you.

45:06.945 --> 45:09.106
I'm gonna be burnt
at the stake too someday.

45:09.181 --> 45:11.809
- What a neat way to die!
- You're all nuts.

45:11.883 --> 45:13.783
- Yeah. Cashews.
- Bless you.

45:13.852 --> 45:16.446
No, really. This is a big secret.

45:16.521 --> 45:18.284
The dog from the river!

45:19.992 --> 45:21.721
Oh, look!

45:21.793 --> 45:23.727
- I told you, you should stay.
- How sweet.

45:23.795 --> 45:26.593
- He's so cute.
- I'll give him my bow.

45:26.665 --> 45:29.065
So this is the big secret.

45:29.134 --> 45:31.432
No, this is not about Genevieve.

45:31.503 --> 45:33.903
- Great name.
- We'll never be able to keep her.

45:42.714 --> 45:45.478
Something is not right.

45:59.698 --> 46:01.962
I don't think she'll find her.

46:11.677 --> 46:15.340
- What's going on, girls?
- Nothing!

46:15.414 --> 46:17.678
We're not hiding anything!

46:17.749 --> 46:20.377
I'll tell you what's going on.
Lord Cuckoo Face is...

46:20.452 --> 46:22.044
- Covington.
- Cuckoo Face.

46:23.889 --> 46:26.323
He's going to sell the school.
I heard it.

46:28.193 --> 46:30.457
Is it true?

46:31.763 --> 46:33.731
Yes, girls.

46:33.799 --> 46:36.529
Lord Covington
intends to sell the school.

46:38.136 --> 46:40.969
- But that's terrible! He can't.
- Why?

46:47.312 --> 46:49.075
Please.

46:56.588 --> 47:01.548
All of this is no reason for us
to stop acting like proper young ladies.

47:01.626 --> 47:04.026
We will not fall to pieces.

47:04.096 --> 47:05.927
We will maintain composure.

47:06.998 --> 47:10.058
Lord Covington
is showing the house tomorrow...

47:10.135 --> 47:12.194
and I intend for it to be spo...

47:20.812 --> 47:22.245
spotless.

47:22.314 --> 47:23.838
Bless you.

47:23.915 --> 47:26.748
Thank you. Good night.

47:29.554 --> 47:32.216
And another thing.

47:32.290 --> 47:34.781
All of you young ladies know
that there is a strict rule...

47:34.860 --> 47:37.192
against pets in the school.

47:37.262 --> 47:40.390
What you do not know is that
I am highly allergic to dogs.

47:45.737 --> 47:49.298
Your new friend can sleep
in the garden shed.

47:52.043 --> 47:53.476
Now go to...

47:55.547 --> 47:57.310
bed.

48:00.318 --> 48:02.752
I can't believe she let us keep her.

48:04.689 --> 48:09.490
- She's just a dog from the street.
- She's the most beautitul dog.

48:09.561 --> 48:12.428
I can't believe
they're closing the school.

48:12.497 --> 48:14.795
We'll never see each other again.

48:14.866 --> 48:16.299
It's not fair.

48:16.368 --> 48:18.302
Close the school.

48:18.370 --> 48:21.828
That Cuckoo Face is super wicked.

48:21.907 --> 48:23.966
Chantal, what are you doing?

48:24.042 --> 48:25.737
Trying to find some way out of this.

48:25.811 --> 48:28.609
You only just found out
how to tie your shoelaces.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.444
Well, I think we're all being
terribly selfish.

48:31.516 --> 48:35.247
Just think of poor,
pathetic Madeline.

48:35.320 --> 48:38.153
She doesn't have any family at all.

48:38.223 --> 48:40.123
Yeah, think of Madeline.

48:40.192 --> 48:43.389
I can't believe she just said that.
She's not pathetic.

48:43.462 --> 48:47.023
I'm sure you'll find someplace
to stay, Madeline.

48:47.098 --> 48:50.397
I'm staying right here.
We all are.

49:12.390 --> 49:14.688
You three on construction.

49:14.759 --> 49:18.388
Aggie, you and Chantal
cover the kitchen.

49:18.463 --> 49:21.330
And you two on dog patrol.

49:21.399 --> 49:24.459
And the rest of you, fall out.

49:29.407 --> 49:31.773
And I'll negotiate with Spain.

49:34.112 --> 49:36.046
Hurry up.

49:37.382 --> 49:39.316
Yes, Vicki.

49:44.789 --> 49:46.723
Come on, Genevieve.

49:49.261 --> 49:50.694
Bye-bye.

50:21.393 --> 50:25.022
- You want me to go and break it up?
- No, look.

50:28.133 --> 50:31.660
That boy is simply misunderstood.

50:42.180 --> 50:46.708
The property's been in my late wife's
family for generations.

50:46.785 --> 50:50.915
The house has been used for the past
tew decades as a school for girls.

50:50.989 --> 50:53.287
Say hello to Lord Covington, girls.

50:53.358 --> 50:56.225
Good morning, Lord Covington.

50:58.964 --> 51:02.127
Young ladies.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.292
Miss Clavel.

51:04.803 --> 51:06.794
Charming.

51:11.309 --> 51:14.608
Hear the song of the nightingale

51:14.679 --> 51:19.275
Singing beautifully

51:19.351 --> 51:21.979
Everyone who listens to her song

51:22.053 --> 51:23.953
Sings along

51:24.022 --> 51:27.458
And think how lovely it will be to have
the Indian flag fluttering on the lawn.

51:29.127 --> 51:31.823
- Now this is the music room.
- Oh, yes.

51:31.896 --> 51:33.830
There is good karma here.

51:41.106 --> 51:43.404
What is that smell?

51:43.475 --> 51:45.409
I can't smell anything.

51:48.913 --> 51:51.609
What? Don't look at me.

51:51.683 --> 51:53.878
Oh, come on, Gopal.

51:56.688 --> 51:59.657
Have a look at these doors.
Solid oak, huh?

51:59.724 --> 52:01.624
They don't make them
like this anymore.

52:04.129 --> 52:07.064
That's probably a good thing.

52:11.369 --> 52:14.202
Now the garden.
Do come have a look at the garden.

52:14.272 --> 52:17.070
- Oh, yes.
- It's most delightful.

52:17.142 --> 52:20.578
Smiling happily

52:22.113 --> 52:24.005
lmmaculate lawns, of course.

52:26.484 --> 52:30.545
Such peace. Such tranquility.

52:31.623 --> 52:33.853
It's true.

52:33.925 --> 52:35.392
Well...

52:44.335 --> 52:45.893
Dance, you suckers!

52:45.970 --> 52:47.835
Dance!

52:53.111 --> 52:56.080
Look! It's Pepito!

52:58.083 --> 53:00.449
No, please! Please reconsider!

53:06.257 --> 53:09.420
The Uzbekistani ambassador
will be arriving soon!

53:09.494 --> 53:12.486
I know he means business!
Please reconsider!

53:19.637 --> 53:21.571
We did it!

53:21.639 --> 53:23.800
It was really funny.
He was, like...

53:32.417 --> 53:35.648
What exactly did you say to Pepito
this morning, Madeline?

53:35.720 --> 53:40.180
All I said is that we were having some
very important guests this morning...

53:40.258 --> 53:44.456
so could you pretty please
be very quiet at that time?

54:32.277 --> 54:34.211
Wait! Stop the car!

54:36.481 --> 54:39.882
If I may say so,
your little boy is a menace!

54:52.330 --> 54:55.322
- Your Excellency.
- I want an explanation.

54:55.400 --> 54:59.029
Why did this loco fellow
say our Pepito is a menace?

54:59.103 --> 55:00.968
I have no idea.

55:01.039 --> 55:04.531
Pepito is a sweet,
well-behaved child.

55:04.609 --> 55:08.010
There's just one problem
with Pepito.

55:08.079 --> 55:11.913
- What is that?
- He needs some diversion.

55:11.983 --> 55:14.850
He spends all day cooped up
in the house studying.

55:14.919 --> 55:16.887
I'm teaching him Latin.

55:16.955 --> 55:19.287
I'm teaching him biology,
algebration...

55:19.357 --> 55:22.622
calculometry, physiconomy
and astrology.

55:22.694 --> 55:24.889
But he can hardly read.

55:24.963 --> 55:27.693
No, he's taken huge leaps.

55:27.765 --> 55:30.598
- How wondertul!
- So, um...

55:30.668 --> 55:34.968
As a reward for all his hard work,
I'm gonna take him to the circus.

55:35.039 --> 55:36.973
The circus?

55:37.041 --> 55:39.669
I love the circus.
We'll all go to the circus.

55:39.744 --> 55:42.645
Oh, great idea.
We will all go!

55:42.714 --> 55:46.013
Look, no.
Just me and Pepito.

55:46.084 --> 55:47.517
Damn!

55:55.693 --> 55:58.628
Ah, Miss Clavel.
I wonder if I could have a moment.

55:58.696 --> 56:01.988
Lord Covington,
do you have any idea what time it is?

56:02.066 --> 56:04.462
- The girls are asleep.
- I'll be brief then.

56:04.535 --> 56:07.231
Here are 12 letters,
one for each one of your pupils.

56:07.305 --> 56:09.334
Kindly see that they reach
the parents.

56:09.407 --> 56:13.043
I'm informing them I shall be closing
the school at the end of the term.

56:13.110 --> 56:14.544
That's quite enough, Miss Clavel!

56:14.612 --> 56:17.706
After your little act of sabotage
this morning, I am in no...

56:17.782 --> 56:20.615
Miss Clavel wasn't the one
who did it. I was.

56:20.685 --> 56:22.448
Go back to bed, Madeline.

56:22.520 --> 56:24.852
Please see that those letters are
delivered tirst thing in the morning.

56:24.923 --> 56:28.757
You can't sell the school,
Lord Cuckoo Face. You can't.

56:33.464 --> 56:35.398
What did you call me?

56:35.466 --> 56:37.764
Lord, um, Covington.

56:37.835 --> 56:40.929
Oh, no, you didn't.
You called me Lord "Cuckoo Face."

56:41.005 --> 56:43.098
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

56:43.174 --> 56:44.971
Yes, she did.

56:46.377 --> 56:47.469
I heard you!

56:49.147 --> 56:53.584
Miss Clavel,
don't you teach your little brats...

56:53.651 --> 56:55.585
even the slightest respect
for their elders?

56:55.653 --> 56:59.316
They are not brats, Lord Covington.
They are young ladies.

57:00.825 --> 57:03.385
They respect their elders
between 7:00 in the morning...

57:03.461 --> 57:05.622
and 9:00 in the evening
when they go to sleep.

57:05.697 --> 57:08.757
This is insubordination, Miss Clavel.

57:10.902 --> 57:12.836
Madeline, please go to bed.

57:17.575 --> 57:19.509
Is this your resignation?

57:25.483 --> 57:30.113
As long as there are children here,
Lord Covington, I will teach them.

57:31.422 --> 57:33.356
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

57:35.059 --> 57:37.459
We won't be needing this one.

57:37.528 --> 57:39.462
Madeline has no family.

58:04.889 --> 58:07.289
They have an animal.

58:36.988 --> 58:39.218
Gotcha.

58:39.290 --> 58:41.053
He's leaving!

58:44.195 --> 58:46.686
And he's taking Genevieve away too!

58:51.602 --> 58:52.864
Leave her alone!

58:55.339 --> 58:57.603
Sir, leave Genevieve alone!

58:57.675 --> 58:59.905
No, Lord Cuckoo Face, no!

58:59.977 --> 59:02.946
Come on! I can't hear you!

59:05.283 --> 59:08.377
Now get out of here, you beast!

59:09.454 --> 59:12.218
Come away from the window.

59:12.290 --> 59:14.656
We have to go get her!

59:14.725 --> 59:18.752
- Girls, please!
- We have to get Genevieve now.

59:18.830 --> 59:20.764
It is the middle of the night.

59:20.832 --> 59:23.892
You are little girls and you know
I won't allow you to go out.

59:25.369 --> 59:28.031
Genevieve will be all right
for one night.

59:28.106 --> 59:30.040
We'll find her tomorrow.

59:30.108 --> 59:32.303
Now, to bed.

59:42.320 --> 59:46.814
Noblest dog in France,
you shall have your vengeance!

01:00:02.173 --> 01:00:03.902
Where can she be?

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:06.535
But, Miss Clavel,
it isn't 9:30 yet.

01:00:06.611 --> 01:00:09.273
Never mind, Serena.
We have a dog to find.

01:00:12.917 --> 01:00:17.354
- Wait for Vicki!
- I didn't get to brush my hair.

01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:20.356
She's about so big,
with a pink bow in her hair.

01:00:20.424 --> 01:00:24.326
She's really brave
and a fabulous swimmer.

01:00:24.395 --> 01:00:28.695
She runs really fast,
and she's got big golden eyes.

01:00:28.766 --> 01:00:32.327
She's got floppy ears and...

01:00:32.403 --> 01:00:35.304
Well, I can't tell you any more,
but please find her.

01:00:35.373 --> 01:00:36.806
You did very well.

01:00:41.379 --> 01:00:44.473
- Have you seen our dog, Genevieve?
- No, I haven't.

01:00:48.819 --> 01:00:51.583
Have you seen our dog?

01:00:51.656 --> 01:00:54.989
- She's quite skinny.
- And she's about that big.

01:00:55.059 --> 01:00:57.323
And it's a labrador...
um, a golden retriever.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.562
Are you sure?

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:13.840
She's gone. Genevieve's gone.

01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:17.711
No, she's not.
We'll find her. I promise you.

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:20.383
We have to have faith.

01:01:20.451 --> 01:01:24.182
I used to wish so hard
for my parents to be alive again...

01:01:24.255 --> 01:01:27.156
but you can't make something happen
just by wishing for it.

01:01:28.426 --> 01:01:29.859
Genevieve's gone.

01:01:29.927 --> 01:01:33.055
She doesn't have a home.
She needs a home.

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:34.757
I know she does.

01:01:34.832 --> 01:01:36.595
I need a home too.

01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:39.534
Madeline, you will always
have a home.

01:01:39.604 --> 01:01:42.368
Yes, but it won't always
be with you, will it?

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.508
Will it?

01:01:48.045 --> 01:01:52.846
There's no place on earth I'd rather be
than with you and the other girls.

01:01:52.917 --> 01:01:55.078
You know that, don't you?

01:02:02.026 --> 01:02:04.620
Get your tickets now!

01:02:05.863 --> 01:02:07.797
Last chance!

01:02:11.469 --> 01:02:13.960
Cirque Pandora!

01:02:27.718 --> 01:02:30.243
I was in love once
with a carnival man.

01:02:30.321 --> 01:02:32.414
He broke my heart, you know.

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:35.789
And he had a beautitul
tattoo that...

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.091
Helene! Please.

01:02:39.163 --> 01:02:40.790
All right, girls.

01:02:40.865 --> 01:02:45.564
Everyone stay with your partners
and let's have fun!

01:02:50.174 --> 01:02:52.108
Come, Madeline!

01:02:54.945 --> 01:02:57.141
I want to get a teddy bear.

01:02:57.415 --> 01:03:01.408
Oh, yeah, and then one of those games
where you go...

01:03:01.485 --> 01:03:02.918
Bang, you're dead!

01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:05.251
Ooh, and I want to get some candy!

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.626
I guess that means he's here.

01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:19.296
Hello, Miss Clavel!

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:25.808
Up here!

01:03:36.754 --> 01:03:38.415
Come on, Madeline.

01:03:44.762 --> 01:03:49.358
And now, the Idiots Popopov!

01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:09.007
They're so stupid!
That's why they're idiots.

01:04:14.326 --> 01:04:16.050
Aggie...

01:04:16.627 --> 01:04:19.218
I have something to tell you.

01:04:19.296 --> 01:04:21.890
I'm not going back with you.

01:04:21.966 --> 01:04:24.901
You're not going back?

01:04:24.969 --> 01:04:27.529
I'm running away with the circus.

01:04:27.605 --> 01:04:30.904
What are you talking about?
We have to go home.

01:04:30.975 --> 01:04:35.674
I don't have a home, Aggie.
The school's closing, and it's my fault.

01:04:36.547 --> 01:04:39.675
The circus will be my new home.
All I have to do...

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:43.777
is learn to juggle or tame lions
or eat fire or something.

01:04:43.854 --> 01:04:45.788
But what about Miss Clavel?

01:04:45.856 --> 01:04:48.488
I'll write to her,
explaining everything.

01:04:49.927 --> 01:04:52.361
You're my best friend
in the whole entire world.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.625
You can't tell anyone
where I went.

01:04:54.698 --> 01:04:57.963
- But, Madeline...
- No buts. You've got to promise.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:01.397
Do you promise,
Agatha Emily Walden?

01:05:03.107 --> 01:05:05.041
I promise.

01:05:09.713 --> 01:05:11.271
Good luck, Madeline.

01:05:44.348 --> 01:05:46.373
No, really.
I don't want to play.

01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:48.816
Oh, Carmen,
be a sport for once.

01:05:48.886 --> 01:05:52.185
- Go, Mom!
- Stay.

01:06:20.584 --> 01:06:23.781
- Whoa!
- Come on, let's go get a balloon.

01:06:23.854 --> 01:06:26.084
- But I'm watching this.
- Come on!

01:06:26.156 --> 01:06:29.216
- Ah, but please!
- Come on!

01:07:08.632 --> 01:07:11.533
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Quiet, kid.

01:07:18.342 --> 01:07:20.276
Oh, terrific.
It's Thumbelina.

01:07:20.344 --> 01:07:22.005
Leave him alone, you!

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:25.571
I knew it.
You're not really a tutor.

01:07:25.649 --> 01:07:29.050
Give Pepito back right now,
or I'll go get Miss Clavel.

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:33.356
Miss Clavel!
I'm terrified, really.

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:03.213
- Have you seen Pepito?
- No, I don't know!

01:08:14.732 --> 01:08:16.926
Tie the knot, idiot!

01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:20.129
Look, for the last time,
"Idiot" is a stage name. I'm Pierre.

01:08:20.203 --> 01:08:24.140
You won't get away with this. My father
will send the Spanish armada after you.

01:08:24.207 --> 01:08:27.666
Your father will thank me,
you spoiled brat!

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:31.304
Take that, you idiot!

01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:34.613
I thought we were just
kidnapping one kid.

01:08:34.685 --> 01:08:37.153
Two kids, two ransoms.

01:08:42.026 --> 01:08:45.689
- This is the life, eh?
- Get in the truck, idiot!

01:08:45.763 --> 01:08:47.196
And he's the smart one!

01:08:58.776 --> 01:09:01.210
One, two, three, four, tive, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven...

01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:03.212
Twelve. All right.

01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.746
Help! Save us, somebody!

01:09:13.823 --> 01:09:16.759
- Help us!
- Please, someone!

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.868
My coat is just dripping.

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:38.037
Let's go upstairs and dry off.
We don't want anyone to catch pneumonia.

01:09:38.115 --> 01:09:41.312
- Miss Clavel?
- Aggie, what is it?

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:44.081
- She ran away.
- Who ran away?

01:09:44.154 --> 01:09:47.817
Madeline. I tried to stop her.
I tried.

01:09:50.294 --> 01:09:51.522
Please, please.

01:10:41.945 --> 01:10:45.278
As I said before, he was with us
all atternoon, and then...

01:10:46.717 --> 01:10:50.016
... the clown in the act,
and then he was with his tutor.

01:10:50.087 --> 01:10:52.954
Oh, Miss Clavel!

01:10:53.023 --> 01:10:56.652
Señor Ambassador, have you seen
my smallest one? My Madeline?

01:10:56.727 --> 01:11:00.390
- Our Pepito's missing too.
- My baby!

01:11:00.464 --> 01:11:03.058
Is it possible the young boy
and the young girl...

01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:05.499
have run off together
on a romantic adventure?

01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:08.504
- Absolutely not.
- It's impossible.

01:11:09.573 --> 01:11:13.737
Yes. Perhaps if the boy
were French...

01:11:15.546 --> 01:11:17.912
We are doing everything possible.

01:11:17.981 --> 01:11:21.348
We have roadblocks everywhere.
Extra units have been called out.

01:11:22.085 --> 01:11:24.144
The proper thing
for you to do is to go home...

01:11:24.221 --> 01:11:26.985
and leave this
to the professionals, please.

01:11:27.057 --> 01:11:30.515
- But, Inspector...
- Don't worry your pretty little head.

01:11:30.594 --> 01:11:34.030
Mr. Ambassador,
we have this under control.

01:11:34.097 --> 01:11:37.828
This kind of thing happens all the time.
Children go to the circus.

01:11:37.901 --> 01:11:42.167
Their little eyes fill with big dreams
of the way life should be.

01:11:44.308 --> 01:11:45.935
What happened to the nun?

01:11:52.416 --> 01:11:56.182
... down six percent due to a lack
of consumer purchasing.

01:11:56.253 --> 01:11:58.813
The search is on tonight
for two missing children...

01:11:58.889 --> 01:12:01.756
who disappeared from the Cirque Pandora
carnival late this afternoon.

01:12:01.825 --> 01:12:05.090
French police are looking for the son
of the Spanish ambassador to France...

01:12:05.162 --> 01:12:06.629
and a local schoolgirl.

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:11.100
What it we never get out of here,
never go home?

01:12:11.168 --> 01:12:14.035
Your family will pay the ransom.

01:12:14.104 --> 01:12:16.971
So will yours.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.600
They can't.

01:12:19.676 --> 01:12:22.736
- I don't have a family.
- What do you mean?

01:12:24.314 --> 01:12:28.011
They're gone.
They're in heaven.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.381
I'm sorry.

01:12:32.489 --> 01:12:36.084
It's all right.
It happened a long time ago.

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:44.228
My parents probably don't want me back.
I'm a lot of trouble, you know?

01:12:45.168 --> 01:12:49.662
You are a lot of trouble.
But you know, you have got charisma.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.708
You think so?

01:12:54.611 --> 01:12:57.409
I miss the girls
and Miss Clavel.

01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:00.114
Don't worry, Madeline.

01:13:00.183 --> 01:13:02.413
I won't leave without you.
I promise.

01:13:02.486 --> 01:13:04.511
Thank you, Pepito.

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:09.957
There have been no signs
of the children.

01:13:10.027 --> 01:13:11.961
Foul play has not been ruled out.

01:13:12.029 --> 01:13:14.361
Authorities are asking
for public cooperation...

01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:16.365
in the departmental-wide canvass.

01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:17.695
Now sport.

01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:21.260
- How could she run away?
- Do you think she's okay out there?

01:13:21.338 --> 01:13:25.934
It's all my fault.
I should have never let her go.

01:13:26.009 --> 01:13:29.445
You did the right thing, Aggie.
I would have done it too.

01:13:31.315 --> 01:13:33.613
I miss Madeline so much.

01:13:45.295 --> 01:13:48.230
So where is she? Hmm?

01:14:05.782 --> 01:14:07.079
Where's your brother?

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:09.084
I don't know.

01:14:11.355 --> 01:14:13.949
I can do anything.

01:14:39.583 --> 01:14:41.073
Pepito, wake up!

01:14:41.885 --> 01:14:45.286
They left us here with the knives
that they juggle at the circus.

01:14:47.324 --> 01:14:49.053
What idiots!

01:14:50.127 --> 01:14:52.254
On the count of three, okay?

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:00.401
Okay, go.

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:06.268
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:06.343 --> 01:15:08.072
Move it!

01:15:11.248 --> 01:15:14.911
- You're getting better.
- Move! Now!

01:15:14.985 --> 01:15:17.453
Hurry up. They're leaving.

01:15:17.521 --> 01:15:20.081
But we're still trapped in here.

01:15:20.157 --> 01:15:22.489
Look! I've got it!

01:15:23.994 --> 01:15:25.120
So?

01:15:25.195 --> 01:15:28.926
So it's a motorcycle,
and you know how to drive one.

01:15:28.999 --> 01:15:31.024
This is our escape.

01:15:31.101 --> 01:15:36.038
But I drive a Vespa.
It doesn't even have gears.

01:15:37.107 --> 01:15:39.735
This is a motorcycle.
I can't drive something like this.

01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:42.904
Yes, you can, Pepito.
You can do it.

01:15:42.979 --> 01:15:47.746
Look, technically, I'm not even
allowed to leave my courtyard.

01:15:54.357 --> 01:15:55.824
Okay, give me your hairpin.

01:16:19.182 --> 01:16:21.616
Idiots! In the truck now!

01:16:21.685 --> 01:16:25.212
- Now! In the truck!
- Sorry about that.

01:16:27.023 --> 01:16:28.513
Hey, wait!

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.163
Yes! We did it!

01:16:39.236 --> 01:16:40.294
Yes!

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.007
Where are you, Thumbelina?

01:16:48.111 --> 01:16:49.510
Oh, no! Look!

01:16:51.114 --> 01:16:52.445
There!

01:16:55.919 --> 01:16:59.446
- Wait! I'll drive!
- Get off!

01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:15.595
Oh, I'm going to be sick!

01:17:15.672 --> 01:17:17.264
Come on, Pepito!

01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:20.605
I'm going!
Hang on, Madeline!

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:02.646
- Faster!
- Hey, you wanna drive or what?

01:18:09.292 --> 01:18:10.657
Hey, who's that?

01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:13.525
Oh, great! Miss Clavel!

01:18:13.597 --> 01:18:15.588
- Who's Miss Clavel?
- Oh, some nun.

01:18:15.665 --> 01:18:17.895
- A nun?
- A nun!

01:18:18.668 --> 01:18:21.068
Hold on, Genevieve.

01:18:43.827 --> 01:18:45.988
Don't kill the nun!

01:18:46.062 --> 01:18:48.758
Forget the nun!
Don't kill the idiots!

01:18:52.902 --> 01:18:54.529
Oh, no!

01:19:00.677 --> 01:19:02.110
Yeah!

01:19:02.178 --> 01:19:04.544
Yea, we did it!

01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:06.639
Ha-ha! We got you!

01:19:07.917 --> 01:19:10.477
Get 'em! Move, you idiot!

01:19:10.553 --> 01:19:13.954
Pierre! My name is Pierre!

01:19:14.024 --> 01:19:17.482
- Look! Look at them!
- Miss Clavel!

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:27.698
Hey, easy!
Are you all right?

01:20:06.643 --> 01:20:08.736
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Not now.

01:20:08.812 --> 01:20:11.178
- Mom, I drove a real motorbike!
- You did?

01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:17.381
- We'll never leave you again.
- Never again.

01:20:26.896 --> 01:20:28.329
She's here!

01:20:28.398 --> 01:20:30.332
Madeline, you're back!

01:20:33.503 --> 01:20:35.733
- I missed you.
- I missed you more.

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:41.272
Great car.

01:20:41.344 --> 01:20:42.606
I thought you were dead.

01:20:45.415 --> 01:20:47.576
Oh, thanks, Vicki.

01:20:47.650 --> 01:20:49.584
Oh, super.

01:20:51.154 --> 01:20:55.716
Tonight I'm going to make
a wonderful vegetarian dinner, okay?

01:20:55.792 --> 01:20:57.783
I want Chicken Helene.

01:20:57.861 --> 01:20:59.055
Oh, no.

01:21:13.309 --> 01:21:17.405
Lord Covington, please. We were
just about to have a celebration.

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.573
Well, yes, indeed.
Young ladies.

01:21:19.649 --> 01:21:23.585
The ambassador from Uzbekistan
has just agreed to buy the school.

01:21:23.653 --> 01:21:25.587
What's Uzbekistan?

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:30.249
Very nice.
Just like in the pictures.

01:21:32.662 --> 01:21:36.655
Very shortly, the Uzbekistani flag
will be fluttering from the root.

01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:42.504
I'm so sorry.

01:21:42.572 --> 01:21:46.303
The house has been used for the past
few decades as a school for girls.

01:21:46.376 --> 01:21:48.310
Yes, as you said.

01:21:48.378 --> 01:21:49.811
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:55.546
Very nice portrait.

01:21:55.618 --> 01:21:57.779
Yes, it's of my late wife.

01:21:57.854 --> 01:22:00.982
It was painted shortly atter
we got back from Venice one year.

01:22:02.392 --> 01:22:06.294
It's rather a good likeness.
I'm very fond of it.

01:22:07.397 --> 01:22:08.728
Marie Gilbert.

01:22:11.234 --> 01:22:14.465
- I know why you're doing this.
- What?

01:22:15.338 --> 01:22:17.806
It's because
you're all alone, isn't it?

01:22:19.609 --> 01:22:22.635
Please, young lady,
please mind your own business.

01:22:22.712 --> 01:22:26.808
You must have loved her very much.
She was your whole family, wasn't she?

01:22:29.285 --> 01:22:33.381
I thought you were mean, Lord Covington,
but you're not. I understand now.

01:22:33.456 --> 01:22:38.189
Understand? How can you possibly
understand? You're only a child.

01:22:41.231 --> 01:22:43.597
You see, my wife, Marie and l...

01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:48.164
This is totally inappropriate.

01:22:48.238 --> 01:22:50.331
Please go away.

01:22:50.406 --> 01:22:53.375
I lost my family too,
a long time ago.

01:22:53.443 --> 01:22:56.003
But they're not really gone,
are they?

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:58.776
She's not gone, is she?

01:22:58.848 --> 01:23:01.373
- She's dead. She's gone.
- No, she's not.

01:23:01.451 --> 01:23:04.579
She's still with you,
and she's in the school too.

01:23:06.322 --> 01:23:09.086
Please, Lord Covington.
She wouldn't want you to sell it.

01:23:12.262 --> 01:23:14.753
My love...

01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:18.790
no matter what happens, I'll make sure
that you and I will be together.

01:23:18.868 --> 01:23:19.800
No, Miss Clavel.

01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:22.235
- Yes!
- No!

01:23:25.341 --> 01:23:27.639
The child's right.

01:23:32.115 --> 01:23:33.707
Yes, you're right.

01:23:36.519 --> 01:23:40.216
But the school's already sold.
There's nothing I can...

01:23:43.526 --> 01:23:45.994
Unless I might be allowed...

01:23:46.062 --> 01:23:47.461
Please, Mr. Ambassador.

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:52.228
I know the girl's school
may not mean much...

01:23:52.302 --> 01:23:54.293
to Uzbekistan or to you, sir...

01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:56.429
I'm not the ambassador.

01:24:02.245 --> 01:24:03.906
I am the ambassador.

01:24:06.215 --> 01:24:07.739
Oh!

01:24:11.621 --> 01:24:14.055
You can keep your school.

01:25:11.214 --> 01:25:15.514
Girls! Stay together!
