WEBVTT

00:13.481 --> 00:14.914
Sorry.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.410
Which way?

00:19.587 --> 00:21.020
That one.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.150
- Excuse me. I need to see your pass.
- Shut up and close the door.

00:35.936 --> 00:39.337
Listen up. Stay in your seats.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.600
Stay calm and please don't move.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.607
Anybody tries to text
or make a phone call, they're dead.

00:46.847 --> 00:50.840
Now, which one of you
is Matt Driscoll?

00:58.592 --> 01:02.358
Show yourself, Driscoll,
or we kill everyone on this damn bus.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.962
- Get up.
- Wait, wait.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.425
I'm Matt Driscoll.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.676
Move it, Mr. Callen.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.508
I got more body mass
to move than you.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.741
You got a lot more excuses too.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.921
Use your legs, not your arms.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.880
I know how to climb.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.114
It doesn't look like it.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.486
From here
I can see your arms shaking.

02:08.929 --> 02:12.330
Ignore her. She's trying
to psych you out again.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.967
Careful, Mr. Callen.

02:15.136 --> 02:19.402
One small slip
and you drop a thousand feet

02:19.607 --> 02:21.700
to the jagged rocks below,

02:22.209 --> 02:24.905
splitting your head open
like a pumpkin.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.146
Where's Hetty?

02:29.316 --> 02:30.977
I'm up here, dear.

02:31.152 --> 02:34.178
Uh... Director Vance
is on the phone for you.

02:34.421 --> 02:35.718
You leave the wall, you forfeit.

02:38.993 --> 02:43.862
Tell the director that he needs to wait
the extra 30 seconds

02:44.031 --> 02:45.498
for Mr. Callen to fall.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.525
Don't let her get in your head, G.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.864
The director says it's urgent
and also to tell you "Archangel."

02:52.072 --> 02:54.506
Oh, bugger.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.034
All right.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.349
Meet us in the bullpen.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.154
You won. Come on.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.791
It's a lot faster going up than
it is coming down, all right, big guy?

03:18.999 --> 03:21.467
- Just let go.
- You gonna catch me?

03:21.669 --> 03:22.863
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.005
You have a mat, you'll be fine.
Come on.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.104
I'm letting go.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.004
I think I'm gonna need some ice.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.208
So, what's the word?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.907
We're waiting on Hetty.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.252
Nell, what do you know?

03:42.423 --> 03:45.551
Archangel is the Pentagon's
code alert for a major security breach.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.058
The Office of Naval Intelligence

03:48.229 --> 03:50.857
has discovered
someone's uploaded the file

03:51.065 --> 03:55.058
containing thousands of classified
Pentagon documents

03:55.236 --> 03:58.865
pertaining to the war in Afghanistan.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.240
Where's Mr. Callen?

04:01.442 --> 04:02.602
He's icing.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.069
- Uploaded where?
- We don't know yet.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.273
- Was it a hack or an inside job?
- We don't know that either.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.575
So, what do we know?

04:11.785 --> 04:14.777
We know it will be a bloody mess
if it goes public.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.286
Embarrassing to our government,
valuable to our enemies.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.153
Dangerous to our military.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.827
I've got something.
I've been working with the Pentagon,

04:22.029 --> 04:23.326
might have a lead on the leak.

04:23.564 --> 04:24.963
Maybe not who took it,

04:25.165 --> 04:28.657
but I've got the IP address of the person
that received the uploaded file.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.463
IP is owned by Ray Crossen.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.764
Good news is he's local.
Lives in Santa Monica.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.668
What's the bad news, Mr. Beale?

04:34.908 --> 04:39.072
He has his own popular web blog
specializing in governmental exposés.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.476
A bit of a recluse,
likes to keep his identity secret.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.547
Has he posted the file
onto his site yet?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.548
- Not yet.
- Can you shut down his server?

04:45.753 --> 04:48.745
His server, his cell service,
his electricity, you name it.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.685
Can you get me free cable?

04:50.924 --> 04:54.087
No, because that would be piracy.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.428
Shut him down, Mr. Beale.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.296
Mr. Hanna, Santa Monica,

04:59.466 --> 05:02.799
and take your gravitationally
challenged partner with you.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.537
Another day in paradise.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.807
Gotta love that fresh ocean air.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.610
You mean the smell of fish?

05:17.785 --> 05:19.625
It's one of the reasons
I moved away from here.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.813
We come from the ocean, G.
It's Mother Nature's womb.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.787
It's true.
It's the primordial soup of life.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.621
Stop with the New Age stuff.
You know that freaks me out.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.026
Next thing I know
you'll be rubbing me with crystals.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.862
You alienate yourself
from the cycles of the Earth,

05:34.034 --> 05:35.467
it's not good.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.503
That's why you can't sleep.
Your circadian rhythm is all messed up.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.174
Are you saying
I don't have any rhythm?

05:41.342 --> 05:43.537
Don't make me break out
my running man on you again.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.838
Last time you unleashed
your running man,

05:46.013 --> 05:48.106
people thought
you were having a seizure.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.008
How are we gonna do this?

05:53.220 --> 05:54.653
Where's the fun in that?

05:55.222 --> 05:56.484
Federal agents.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.420
Mr. Crossen?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.673
Got a body.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.736
It's Crossen.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.505
The place is clear.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.674
I'm guessing they waterboarded him
then drowned him.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.391
Here we go.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.525
That's our missing file.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.133
It's worthless
without the decryption key.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.399
- Yeah.
- Eric.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.541
Ray Crossen is dead.
Look, we got a computer here.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.974
It looks like it might be the classified
Pentagon file on it.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.045
You should have access to it now.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.114
- I got it.
- Can you open it?

06:57.317 --> 06:58.409
I'm trying.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.111
You okay?

07:02.756 --> 07:03.916
I'm okay.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.284
You don't look okay.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.419
I just don't understand
why someone would do this.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.597
Betray their own.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.632
A lot of different reasons
according to Nate.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.599
None of them good.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.070
Callen, this is seriously encrypted.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.798
Well, how long
until you can crack it?

07:22.009 --> 07:25.240
Anywhere between an hour and never.
I honestly don't know.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.913
Can you tell if anyone's opened it?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.775
Oh, somebody's been trying.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.280
Thirty-two attempts to be exact,
all of them failed.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.977
But they did make
a copy onto a flash drive.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.849
- Not good.
- Got it.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.156
They copied it.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.486
Gotta assume Crossen
didn't know the decryption key.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.961
But whoever sent him
the stolen Pentagon file does.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.098
They're next.

07:57.743 --> 07:58.835
Mr. Callen?

08:03.249 --> 08:05.342
I just got off the phone
with Director Vance.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.487
He's on his way to brief SECNAV,

08:08.654 --> 08:10.986
who in turn has an appointment
with the president.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.749
You know what that means,
don't you?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.220
Heads are gonna roll.

08:14.393 --> 08:18.159
It's that other end of one's anatomy
I'm worried about.

08:19.365 --> 08:22.960
The ass chewing gets worse
on the way back down the ladder.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.833
Well, does that mean you're next?

08:25.037 --> 08:29.565
No, because you're going to
resolve this before that happens.

08:30.242 --> 08:34.110
I will do my best
to protect your assets.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.238
Crossen's server
and laptop have drawn a blank.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.256
Compartmentalized encryption,
multiple proxies,

08:39.418 --> 08:41.750
and if he had an e-mail list,
it was in his head.

08:41.986 --> 08:44.581
But what we do have
are his loyal followers

08:44.757 --> 08:47.385
who log onto his website regularly
to read the latest doom.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.996
Now, I figure whoever uploaded
the classified files to his website

08:51.197 --> 08:53.062
was probably a frequent visitor.

08:53.232 --> 08:56.292
- How many frequent visitors?
- Over 700.

08:56.502 --> 08:59.198
So I filtered them
through Nell's data analysis.

08:59.371 --> 09:01.635
We've been anatomizing
the type of documents

09:01.807 --> 09:04.105
that might have been accessed
from the Pentagon.

09:04.276 --> 09:06.540
We can eliminate anyone
without the security clearance.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.577
And by cross-referencing
Eric's information,

09:08.748 --> 09:10.909
we were able to track it
to one standout candidate.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.551
The admin department
of one Shaktorn Defense Systems.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.050
They uploaded it to Crossen.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.085
It's a defense contractor,
works for the Navy.

09:17.289 --> 09:18.813
- We got a name?
- Not yet.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.492
They run their own internal network
through a secure system.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.594
So we can't tell
which computer was used.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.288
Whoever it was uploaded
the file to Crossen.

09:26.465 --> 09:28.729
Crossen hadn't posted it
onto his website yet

09:28.901 --> 09:30.391
because they didn't give him a key.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.230
So they're anxiously waiting.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.569
We send a message from Crossen

09:35.741 --> 09:38.141
to every computer
in the admin department.

09:38.310 --> 09:41.939
Tell them Crossen needs to meet
to discuss an important development.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.479
Flush out the real culprit.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.642
Sounds like a plan.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.984
How did they know?

09:52.158 --> 09:53.318
How did who know?

09:53.492 --> 09:55.153
The team
that's after this decryption key.

09:55.327 --> 09:56.487
The guys who killed Crossen.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.152
How did they know
the file was coming?

09:58.330 --> 10:00.195
One answer at a time.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.976
Ugh. If I drink another espresso

10:15.147 --> 10:17.707
somebody's gonna have to bring me
some Rolaids.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.284
I told you to switch to decaf.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.513
- Kensi, do you see anything?
- No.

10:23.722 --> 10:25.485
Oh, this is awesome.

10:25.658 --> 10:28.627
- What are you looking for?
- I'm looking for something to eat.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.662
Well, that's a glove compartment,
not a refrigerator.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.059
Yeah, like you don't stash
your Ho Hos in here.

10:34.233 --> 10:37.202
All right, come on, lady. Don't hold out
on me because I am starving.

10:37.369 --> 10:39.496
- I don't have anything.
- Yes, you do.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.902
- I don't have anything.
- How come I smell...

10:47.346 --> 10:49.541
- Peanut butter cups?
- What?

10:49.748 --> 10:52.080
Yeah, peanut butter, chocolate,
I smell it.

10:52.251 --> 10:54.981
- Where is it?
- No, no.

10:55.187 --> 10:56.484
Do you know why you smell them?

10:56.655 --> 10:57.986
- Because...
- Because?

10:58.190 --> 11:03.890
I left one on the seat and it melted
many, many, many months ago.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.655
So why do we smell it now?

11:12.738 --> 11:14.535
Got an anxious brunette
coming up on Callen.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.208
- She's clocking him.
- I got her.

11:20.512 --> 11:22.173
Ray Crossen?

11:22.348 --> 11:23.747
Sorry.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.748
Hey, hi, have a seat.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.186
- You must be...
- Jenny.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.622
It's nice to finally meet you, Jenny.

11:34.793 --> 11:36.158
What did you need to talk about?

11:37.730 --> 11:39.789
I just wanna ask you
some questions.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.455
You know,
my blog is important to me.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.692
I feel like what I do
has an impact on others.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.598
I agree.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.869
Then you agree that it's important
for people to know the truth.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.874
Like you say on the website,

11:51.043 --> 11:53.978
"True freedom only comes with
the transparency of our government."

11:54.179 --> 11:55.203
Exactly.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.245
My blog is my reputation,

11:57.449 --> 11:59.747
which is why I need to know
where you got that file from

11:59.919 --> 12:01.147
and what's in it exactly.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.548
I can't do that.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.747
I won't publish any names, I just
wanna make sure it's the real deal.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.449
Trust me, it is.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.321
But I have to protect my source.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.157
Heads up,
I think Jenny brought company.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.799
Callen,
check the couple behind you.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.762
Got them.

12:21.607 --> 12:24.201
There's another one coming
in the opposite direction.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.844
They're boxing them in. Let's go.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.078
- You hearing this, Sam?
- I hear what you're saying.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.781
Get ready to move.

12:37.356 --> 12:38.653
- Hey.
- We need to move now.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.135
- What are you doing?
- You're in danger.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.421
Expect me to say something?

12:41.593 --> 12:43.424
- How about excuse me?
- You bumped into me.

12:43.595 --> 12:44.619
Oh, really. Is that it?

12:46.131 --> 12:48.622
- Get the hell out of my way.
- Oh, you're one of those, huh?

12:48.801 --> 12:50.268
Think you own the sidewalk?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.314
I bet you do the same on the freeway.
Think you own that too.

12:52.338 --> 12:55.330
Maybe you gotta get home faster
than everybody else, is that it?

13:02.314 --> 13:03.804
Let's go.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.274
In your big fat European sports car.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.478
Hey, I'm talking to you.

13:16.795 --> 13:19.320
- Who are you?
- Did you lose somebody?

13:19.498 --> 13:20.658
I hate when that happens.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.497
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Whoa.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.534
Good morning.

13:32.077 --> 13:35.911
- You're making a big mistake.
- That's actually my line.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.174
Are you prepared to shoot
three FBI agents in broad daylight?

13:43.856 --> 13:45.585
May I?

13:45.791 --> 13:46.815
Left hand.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.160
You looking for this?

13:54.533 --> 13:56.865
Oh, buddy, that badge better be real

13:57.036 --> 13:59.561
or my partner's gonna kick you
in the FBI balls.

14:11.515 --> 14:13.039
Is that what you call surveillance?

14:13.251 --> 14:15.412
Well, we sure as hell surveilled
your FBI asses.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.588
You're interfering
with a federal investigation.

14:17.755 --> 14:20.656
- Our investigation, actually.
- We've been working this for months.

14:20.891 --> 14:22.916
Then it's clearly time for us
to take over.

14:23.127 --> 14:24.958
You wouldn't have even known
there was a leak

14:25.129 --> 14:26.707
if Naval Intelligence
hadn't discovered it.

14:26.731 --> 14:28.062
Isn't that an oxymoron?

14:28.266 --> 14:29.460
No.

14:29.634 --> 14:33.593
But there is a moron in all this.
Several, in fact.

14:33.771 --> 14:34.795
Oh, snap. What?

14:34.972 --> 14:37.065
Point, Kensi, FBI serves.

14:37.942 --> 14:39.773
You've overstepped your jurisdiction.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.410
We're the senior agency here.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.304
Good point,

14:43.547 --> 14:47.415
but it's best to be sure
about a thing like that.

14:47.585 --> 14:49.052
I'll get Hetty in on this.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.547
Hetty? As in Henrietta Lange?

14:52.757 --> 14:54.486
- Hetty, Callen.
- Do you know her?

14:55.326 --> 14:56.588
We've heard stories.

14:56.794 --> 14:58.591
Sounds like a whole lot
of urban legend.

14:59.964 --> 15:00.988
She's real.

15:01.165 --> 15:05.067
And you do not want that little
chupacabra surveilling your asses.

15:08.639 --> 15:10.163
She wants to talk to you.

15:14.111 --> 15:15.135
This is Agent Frisbee.

15:15.346 --> 15:18.372
Langdon Archibald Frisbee,
born in Hackensack, New Jersey.

15:18.616 --> 15:21.710
Agent Langdon Archibald Frisbee,
from Hackensack?

15:21.886 --> 15:24.081
- Yes.
- His wife's name is Darlene.

15:24.288 --> 15:27.519
- How's your wife, Darlene?
- She's fine.

15:27.725 --> 15:31.286
Lots of late-night phone calls
to this woman, a Heather Teasdale.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.535
She's a recent divorcée,
works in the same building.

15:33.698 --> 15:35.495
How's Heather?

15:39.303 --> 15:41.533
- Heather?
- Teasdale.

15:41.739 --> 15:43.001
Oh, no.

15:43.174 --> 15:46.200
Oh, was that a secret? I'm so sorry.

15:47.111 --> 15:48.373
I think we can both agree,

15:48.546 --> 15:52.642
Agent Frisbee, that this is a matter
of national security.

15:52.817 --> 15:53.841
It's Frisbee.

15:54.018 --> 15:56.714
I would hate to have to call Bobby
and complain to him

15:56.887 --> 16:01.517
about your reluctance to collaborate
with us on such a serious matter.

16:01.692 --> 16:03.319
Bobby?

16:04.128 --> 16:05.686
Your director.

16:05.863 --> 16:08.058
I don't think that will be necessary.

16:08.265 --> 16:10.256
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.

16:11.669 --> 16:14.001
Have a wonderful day,
Agent Frisbee.

16:14.205 --> 16:15.638
It's Fris...

16:22.446 --> 16:24.277
Is everything okay?

16:25.015 --> 16:26.505
Tell them.

16:29.453 --> 16:33.947
We were tasked to investigate a series
of low-level leaks here in Los Angeles.

16:34.158 --> 16:37.093
Our investigation has been focusing
on a petty officer.

16:37.261 --> 16:41.220
We know he had a partner, but we
didn't know who it was until today.

16:41.766 --> 16:42.790
The woman who met Sam.

16:43.033 --> 16:44.364
And her name is?

16:45.202 --> 16:47.295
Jennifer Weincroft.

16:47.471 --> 16:50.668
- She's an admin manager at...
- Shaktorn Defense Systems.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.400
Your turn. Where is she?

16:55.279 --> 16:57.304
I have no idea.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.723
Are you going to arrest me?

17:07.925 --> 17:10.290
It depends on what you've done.

17:10.761 --> 17:12.058
And what can be undone.

17:12.896 --> 17:14.421
How long do we have to stay
up here?

17:15.065 --> 17:16.555
Until it's safe enough to leave.

17:17.101 --> 17:18.590
Until you tell me what you know.

17:19.303 --> 17:21.430
And what makes you think
I need your help?

17:21.638 --> 17:23.607
Because I'm pretty sure
you don't wanna end up

17:23.773 --> 17:24.934
like the guy you came to see.

17:26.343 --> 17:28.277
Ray Crossen.

17:29.747 --> 17:32.773
- Who did that?
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

17:40.825 --> 17:42.520
My boyfriend's in the Navy.

17:43.961 --> 17:48.591
He compiled operational
and after-battle reports.

17:49.033 --> 17:52.264
First in Iraq,
more recently in Afghanistan.

17:53.804 --> 17:57.433
After a while it started to get to him.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.632
Get to him how?

17:59.810 --> 18:01.641
It wore him down.

18:01.846 --> 18:06.340
Day after day, reading the reports,
compiling casualty lists,

18:06.517 --> 18:08.542
feeling helpless to do anything.

18:08.786 --> 18:11.949
He's a petty officer
with top-level security clearance.

18:12.122 --> 18:16.183
At some point, our petty officer
went from believer to an observer.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.294
From patriot to traitor.

18:18.496 --> 18:20.726
He started stealing
classified documents?

18:20.898 --> 18:24.334
He asked me to leak material
onto the Internet.

18:25.035 --> 18:27.526
He just wanted someone to listen.

18:27.705 --> 18:29.366
And you agreed?

18:30.207 --> 18:32.641
I just wanted to help him
get through this.

18:32.810 --> 18:34.801
What started out as some
rather benign statistics

18:35.012 --> 18:39.210
eventually ballooned into a full-scale
breach of very sensitive material.

18:40.518 --> 18:41.712
What kind of material?

18:43.821 --> 18:44.845
We don't know exactly.

18:45.789 --> 18:46.881
He logged into a database

18:47.057 --> 18:49.821
that contained information
about past operations in Iraq

18:49.994 --> 18:53.725
and ongoing operations
in Afghanistan, including black ops.

18:54.899 --> 18:56.867
Your boyfriend
was trying to affect change

18:57.034 --> 18:59.525
by shaming the government
into changing its policy.

19:02.006 --> 19:03.564
What's your boyfriend's name,
Jenny?

19:03.807 --> 19:06.571
- We can't reveal that.
- You haven't brought him in?

19:06.810 --> 19:08.835
Oh, we know where he is,
every second.

19:09.013 --> 19:10.310
I thought we were cooperating.

19:10.514 --> 19:12.709
I think we've told you enough.

19:12.917 --> 19:14.544
Hetty is not gonna like that.

19:17.922 --> 19:18.946
That's probably her now.

19:21.625 --> 19:24.423
- Yeah.
- Her boyfriend's name is Matt Driscoll.

19:24.595 --> 19:27.530
Petty Officer Matt Driscoll.
I'm sending an address.

19:27.698 --> 19:30.098
- Got it.
- So?

19:31.468 --> 19:32.935
So I think we're good.

19:33.137 --> 19:34.764
Thank you for sharing.

19:34.972 --> 19:36.963
We'll be sure to let you know
if we find anything

19:37.141 --> 19:39.041
and I hope you'll do the same for us.

19:41.345 --> 19:43.074
Of course.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.716
Oh, and, uh,

19:48.619 --> 19:51.417
we don't validate,
just in case you're wondering.

19:55.059 --> 19:58.460
Oh, and, uh, be sure to try
the churros around the corner.

19:58.662 --> 20:00.289
They're awesome.

20:02.066 --> 20:04.626
Jenny's boyfriend
is Petty Officer Matt Driscoll.

20:04.802 --> 20:05.826
Lives in Silver Lake.

20:06.003 --> 20:08.369
- I e-mailed you the address.
- We're on it.

20:09.173 --> 20:10.231
- Eric.
- Yeah.

20:10.407 --> 20:13.740
We're gonna need everything
we've got on Petty Officer Matt Driscoll.

20:13.911 --> 20:15.173
Matt's a good man.

20:15.412 --> 20:17.505
Good men
don't steal national secrets.

20:17.748 --> 20:19.943
Matt's not a traitor, Agent Hanna.

20:20.618 --> 20:22.586
He just wants someone to listen.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.413
He took an oath
when he joined the Navy.

20:24.622 --> 20:28.149
I know and so does he.
He's just so torn up about doing this.

20:28.325 --> 20:31.988
I swear,
he just didn't know what else to do.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.524
Promise me you won't hurt him.

20:38.335 --> 20:40.462
I'm trying to help him.

20:42.306 --> 20:43.466
But he has to let us.

20:48.612 --> 20:50.204
Call him.

20:51.715 --> 20:54.013
Tell him to go home and wait.

20:55.352 --> 20:57.286
Tell him we're coming.

21:27.084 --> 21:29.075
I like the way you handled
that FBI agent.

21:29.253 --> 21:32.051
Can you believe her attitude?

21:33.757 --> 21:35.315
You should've thrown down
with her.

21:35.492 --> 21:36.982
Why, so you could
watch us catfight?

21:37.161 --> 21:40.153
What? No. Wait, maybe.

21:40.330 --> 21:41.888
What about a pillow fight in lingerie?

21:42.066 --> 21:44.557
See, now you're just teasing me.

21:44.735 --> 21:47.329
- Someone's inside.
- Driscoll?

21:47.504 --> 21:48.528
Didn't get a good look.

21:48.706 --> 21:50.697
I'll cover the back.
You take the front.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.705
Oh, Kensi?

21:55.112 --> 21:57.979
- Petty Officer Matt Driscoll?
- Yeah.

21:58.182 --> 21:59.774
NCIS.

22:01.418 --> 22:03.579
They've got weapons, get down.

22:08.192 --> 22:09.523
More company.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.598
- Six is clear.
- Okay.

22:25.943 --> 22:27.240
Go.

22:34.118 --> 22:36.746
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

22:51.600 --> 22:53.295
Yeah, got it.

22:56.238 --> 22:58.331
- Oh, my God.
- Stay here.

23:03.012 --> 23:05.207
- Driscoll?
- He came, he saw, he fled.

23:05.381 --> 23:06.848
Pick-up, Eric's putting out a BOLO.

23:07.016 --> 23:09.883
Two down, two got away.
Cashed up, no ID.

23:10.052 --> 23:11.542
They were inside waiting for him.

23:11.754 --> 23:13.187
- How's our girl?
- On edge.

23:16.459 --> 23:19.121
- Go.
- I'm putting you on speaker, Sam.

23:19.328 --> 23:22.388
Two shooters at Driscoll's house
were both contract soldiers.

23:22.631 --> 23:24.826
Travis Dale Donovan,
former British Army,

23:25.001 --> 23:28.732
and Peter Van Hoost, former
South African National Defence Force.

23:28.904 --> 23:29.996
Mercenaries.

23:30.206 --> 23:34.040
Arrived in the country
on tourist visas three weeks ago.

23:34.276 --> 23:36.039
Multiple entries into the U.S.,
Europe, Asia

23:36.212 --> 23:37.770
and Africa over the past 18 months.

23:37.980 --> 23:40.471
- These guys get around.
- Who do they get around with?

23:40.683 --> 23:43.379
Known associates,
Jans Christian Kemp,

23:43.552 --> 23:46.521
former captain in the old
South African Defence Force.

23:46.722 --> 23:49.919
Kemp runs a private security firm
based in Amsterdam.

23:50.092 --> 23:52.925
Boasts he has connections
on all levels of U.S. Government.

23:53.095 --> 23:58.795
And then there's Bradford Harris Elgin,
former Army Ranger from Ohio.

23:59.001 --> 24:00.491
Cashed out 12 years ago.

24:00.703 --> 24:02.330
Bet they all flew in
on the same flight.

24:02.538 --> 24:04.836
Send the photos to Kensi
and Deeks to ID.

24:05.007 --> 24:06.531
Eric, see if you can track Driscoll.

24:07.243 --> 24:08.369
Sam, what are you thinking?

24:08.544 --> 24:11.536
I'm thinking classified intel
is not worth much on the black market

24:11.714 --> 24:14.547
if everybody with a computer
can download it on the Internet.

24:14.717 --> 24:17.185
- They need that decryption key.
- They need Driscoll.

24:17.386 --> 24:19.616
FBI still claiming they don't know
what's in that file?

24:19.822 --> 24:21.187
- Yeah.
- You believe them?

24:21.357 --> 24:24.417
It's possible.
The only one who can answer that is...

24:24.593 --> 24:25.958
- Him again.
- Popular guy.

24:26.195 --> 24:28.026
Not with everyone.

24:28.230 --> 24:30.357
That is one of the guys.

24:30.966 --> 24:33.696
Yeah, there's your other one.

24:34.236 --> 24:36.397
Driscoll is downtown somewhere,
I can't pinpoint him.

24:36.572 --> 24:37.971
He turned off his GPS.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.801
Driscoll answered
last time Jenny called.

24:39.975 --> 24:43.206
The last time he did what she asked,
he ended up almost getting killed.

24:45.714 --> 24:47.147
Will you call Matt again?

24:57.059 --> 24:58.993
Leave
your number, I'll get back to you.

24:59.161 --> 25:02.130
Matt, it's Jenny.
Call me as soon as you get this.

25:06.502 --> 25:07.935
Where would he go
if he was scared?

25:09.371 --> 25:10.998
My place.

25:14.643 --> 25:15.974
Who are they?

25:16.145 --> 25:17.305
FBI.

25:18.747 --> 25:20.942
- What do they want?
- You.

25:23.119 --> 25:25.519
Agent Frisbee.
Hey, buddy, you missed a shootout.

25:25.754 --> 25:28.780
Oh, thanks for taking care
of our suspect. We'll take it from here.

25:28.991 --> 25:31.482
Sorry, I can't do that,
I just arrested her.

25:34.263 --> 25:36.288
How long will that process take,
Agent Blye?

25:36.465 --> 25:38.160
Forty-eight hours.

25:38.334 --> 25:40.529
Shocking, isn't it?

25:43.539 --> 25:44.801
Please...

25:47.309 --> 25:48.776
find him.

25:50.913 --> 25:52.346
This way.

25:58.921 --> 26:02.220
You guys waited too long to move.
And when you did it was too late.

26:03.025 --> 26:06.119
Now you wanna save face
by doing it all on your own.

26:07.196 --> 26:09.187
You guys don't even know
what Driscoll downloaded

26:09.365 --> 26:11.162
into those files, do you?

26:11.634 --> 26:14.228
We will win this. You know that.

26:14.470 --> 26:16.199
I'll tell Hetty to expect your call.

26:26.749 --> 26:27.807
Yeah.

26:27.983 --> 26:30.451
Eric, I need
Jenny Weincroft's address.

26:30.653 --> 26:32.587
- Copy that.
- Jenny reach him, Sam?

26:32.821 --> 26:35.881
He didn't pick up
but she says he'll go to her place.

26:36.559 --> 26:38.527
FBI just left empty-handed.
They're not happy.

26:38.727 --> 26:39.921
Now where's Jenny?

26:40.095 --> 26:42.154
Deeks and Kensi
are taking her to the boatshed.

26:42.364 --> 26:43.524
Address is on your phone.

26:43.699 --> 26:45.189
- Meet you there.
- Cool.

26:50.606 --> 26:52.733
- Yeah?
- Eric, I'm at the address.

26:52.908 --> 26:55.843
- What's G's ETA?
- Callen's still 20 minutes out, Sam.

26:56.045 --> 26:57.478
Thanks.

27:07.122 --> 27:10.387
Matt Driscoll,
Special Agent Sam Hanna, NCIS.

27:15.064 --> 27:16.292
Matt, Jenny sent me.

27:23.539 --> 27:24.699
Come on.

27:25.241 --> 27:27.106
- You alone?
- Yeah.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.780
What the hell is happening?
Is Jenny okay?

27:33.949 --> 27:35.541
Told me to go home,
when I got there...

27:35.718 --> 27:36.878
You walked into something.

27:37.086 --> 27:39.111
- Who were they?
- They want what you've got.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.086
What could I possibly have...?

27:42.591 --> 27:45.822
The decryption key.
They want the decryption key.

27:46.428 --> 27:48.658
The file is worthless without it.

27:50.466 --> 27:54.459
Here, give it to them for God's sake.

27:54.637 --> 27:57.299
- That quick, huh?
- That quick.

28:04.413 --> 28:06.244
What did you download exactly?

28:07.249 --> 28:09.308
You can see for yourself. I can't...

28:09.485 --> 28:12.147
I can't look at it anymore,
I can't keep doing it.

28:12.321 --> 28:14.346
This was Jenny's idea.

28:14.556 --> 28:17.457
Putting this file together,
she thought it would help.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.426
Did you ever do a tour?

28:23.999 --> 28:26.331
- No.
- Ever volunteer?

28:28.304 --> 28:30.932
Is that what you think?
I'm a coward?

28:31.140 --> 28:32.664
Are you?

28:34.143 --> 28:36.839
Every rotation, I volunteer.

28:37.012 --> 28:39.207
I always get knocked back.

28:39.381 --> 28:42.873
Same reason every time,
"too valuable."

28:47.890 --> 28:50.950
We who stay behind serve as well.

28:51.593 --> 28:53.788
Now they give a medal for that.

28:55.297 --> 28:59.393
That's me, too valuable.
Too good at what I do.

28:59.635 --> 29:01.466
What do you do?

29:04.540 --> 29:06.303
Turn names into numbers.

29:07.609 --> 29:10.203
People into statistics.

29:10.713 --> 29:12.738
Important stuff, right?

29:15.250 --> 29:17.218
Nobody's better at it.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.480
Good old Matt, Mr. Numbers.

29:22.157 --> 29:24.523
- Are you former military?
- SEAL.

29:26.495 --> 29:28.861
- You'll never understand.
- Try me.

29:36.338 --> 29:39.000
Operational debriefs.

29:40.442 --> 29:42.910
After-action reports.

29:46.281 --> 29:47.942
Names.

29:50.586 --> 29:52.349
Places.

29:54.089 --> 29:58.185
Dead, wounded,
breaking and broken.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.597
You know what my CO said to me?

30:13.976 --> 30:18.913
No one in the military knows
as much as I do in my field.

30:22.050 --> 30:23.745
No one.

30:30.225 --> 30:33.490
And at the end of the day,
I just turn them into numbers.

30:41.336 --> 30:42.997
Your friends are here.

30:43.205 --> 30:45.435
I'm only expecting one.

30:50.512 --> 30:52.104
Is there a back way out
of this place?

30:57.352 --> 30:59.081
Let's go.

30:59.855 --> 31:04.155
Eric, tell Callen we've got company,
Kemp.

31:05.027 --> 31:07.154
- Party of seven.
- Copy that.

31:07.362 --> 31:08.454
Nell, I need a street map.

31:08.630 --> 31:10.825
Six block radius centered
on Sam's current location.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.296
Typing.

31:12.468 --> 31:14.299
Alert Kensi and Deeks,
tell them to get there.

31:14.470 --> 31:16.529
Callen, we've got a little problem.

31:22.778 --> 31:23.836
Check the back.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.879
Move.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.885
If you stopped for doughnuts,
I will be pissed.

31:41.129 --> 31:42.653
I can stop if you want.

31:42.865 --> 31:44.389
What's the sit-rep?

31:44.566 --> 31:46.158
Driscoll's with me.

31:46.368 --> 31:49.303
We're south of the apartment building.
The cross street is 23rd.

31:49.505 --> 31:50.802
Can you get to your car?

31:52.174 --> 31:53.402
Kemp's flooding the area.

31:56.044 --> 31:58.638
- They're boxing us in.
- I'll be there in ten minutes.

31:58.847 --> 32:00.371
I'm not sure we got ten minutes.

32:01.049 --> 32:04.746
Wait, Sam, the FBI said they knew
where Driscoll was every second.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.286
Kemp must have hacked
into the system. Driscoll's bugged.

32:08.323 --> 32:09.984
- Give me your phone.
- Here.

32:12.661 --> 32:13.787
Hey, what the hell?

32:13.996 --> 32:16.988
You're bugged with a GPS locator.
Wristwatch, keys, anything electronic.

32:19.535 --> 32:21.503
Come on, come on.

32:23.805 --> 32:25.568
That's all I got.

32:26.008 --> 32:27.566
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

32:30.112 --> 32:31.704
- What about a cab?
- In L. A?

32:31.880 --> 32:33.711
What, are you kidding me?

32:39.922 --> 32:42.720
- Nowhere to run, G.
- Be there in five.

32:42.891 --> 32:44.518
- Drive faster.
- Where to?

32:46.423 --> 32:47.583
There.

33:07.381 --> 33:10.475
The Hollywood Safari Tour
will be leaving very shortly.

33:10.651 --> 33:13.085
They're still tracking you.
Empty your pockets.

33:19.193 --> 33:20.660
The garage remote.

33:25.566 --> 33:27.431
Excuse me, I need to see your pass.

33:27.601 --> 33:30.092
Shut up, close the door.

33:48.488 --> 33:50.979
Listen up. Stay in your seats.

33:51.191 --> 33:53.022
Stay calm

33:53.694 --> 33:55.127
and please don't move.

33:55.362 --> 33:57.922
Anybody tries to text
or make a phone call, they're dead.

33:59.733 --> 34:03.396
Now, which one of you
is Matt Driscoll?

34:12.279 --> 34:15.873
Show yourself, Driscoll,
or we kill everyone on this damn bus.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.889
- Get up.
- Wait, wait.

34:24.524 --> 34:25.752
I'm Matt Driscoll.

34:47.547 --> 34:51.608
The FBI assigns you one agent.
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

34:51.784 --> 34:54.413
You're worth more than that,
Driscoll.

34:55.455 --> 34:57.480
Off the bus, move.

35:05.866 --> 35:07.356
I don't have the decryption key.

35:08.001 --> 35:10.765
You don't get it, do you?
It's not the file I want.

35:10.971 --> 35:13.462
It's your talent
to get into the Pentagon database.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.471
You have any idea
how much that's worth to me?

35:17.844 --> 35:20.005
That's not him, that's not Driscoll.

35:36.663 --> 35:38.597
Eric, I need an ambulance, now.

35:38.799 --> 35:40.733
Multiple casualties,
one of them is Driscoll.

35:40.901 --> 35:42.391
On it.

35:55.148 --> 35:58.174
Help is on the way.
You hang in there.

35:58.752 --> 35:59.980
You hear me, Matt?

36:01.988 --> 36:03.512
Help's coming.

36:07.194 --> 36:11.130
Names, not numbers.

36:44.564 --> 36:46.225
It's too late.

36:47.067 --> 36:51.367
Next time you wanna entrap someone,
be prepared for the consequences.

37:04.117 --> 37:05.675
Come on, get in the car.

37:10.690 --> 37:15.457
Every time he applied for a posting,
I prayed they'd say no,

37:16.129 --> 37:17.892
and they did.

37:19.633 --> 37:21.464
Made me happy,

37:21.968 --> 37:23.492
made him sad.

37:24.070 --> 37:27.096
He said releasing the file
on the Internet was your idea.

37:29.643 --> 37:32.009
I thought it would help him.

37:33.447 --> 37:36.507
He was so haunted by his work.

37:42.756 --> 37:44.314
What happens now?

37:44.825 --> 37:47.123
There'll be an investigation.

37:47.727 --> 37:48.955
And the FBI?

37:49.429 --> 37:50.953
Them too.

37:54.534 --> 37:56.627
I did it for Matt.

37:57.971 --> 38:03.841
So he'd have something
he could be proud of.

38:10.016 --> 38:11.643
You haven't looked at the files.

38:12.319 --> 38:13.377
No.

38:21.461 --> 38:25.625
Agent Callen mentioned
that Matt said something?

38:33.840 --> 38:35.330
Your name.

39:11.411 --> 39:13.345
FBI is on their way over.

39:14.447 --> 39:16.381
I'll wait with her.

39:18.585 --> 39:20.416
Which would suggest
that I'm going somewhere?

39:28.361 --> 39:29.885
For Eric.

39:42.976 --> 39:45.035
What did Driscoll
really say before he died?

39:50.483 --> 39:52.644
"Names, not numbers."

40:02.896 --> 40:05.922
- See if that works.
- Decryption key.

40:07.367 --> 40:11.303
Hetty's looking for you.
Something about unfinished business.

40:12.105 --> 40:13.629
It works.

40:14.741 --> 40:16.003
They're all Special Forces.

40:18.445 --> 40:21.471
Somebody wanna explain
why this is so sensitive?

40:21.648 --> 40:23.582
It's not.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.377
The FBI just thought it might be.

40:28.455 --> 40:31.083
So, what is it exactly?

40:31.291 --> 40:32.383
A tribute.

40:32.592 --> 40:33.752
To the fallen.

40:37.631 --> 40:42.466
Driscoll wasn't accessing confidential
information to steal secrets.

40:43.336 --> 40:46.931
He was compiling the names of
soldiers killed on classified missions.

40:51.478 --> 40:54.208
Names, not serial numbers.

41:02.188 --> 41:04.850
You know, I didn't fire
my first gun until I was 20.

41:07.527 --> 41:10.724
A necessary evil in our trade,
I'm afraid.

41:10.964 --> 41:14.798
We are a violent bunch, aren't we?

41:14.968 --> 41:16.026
Humans.

41:16.569 --> 41:18.469
Sometimes.

41:19.239 --> 41:26.304
But we can also be poetic, musical,
spiritual, compassionate.

41:28.581 --> 41:30.845
So, what is it that made Driscoll
do what he did?

41:33.319 --> 41:36.948
Oh, misguided frustration.

41:37.157 --> 41:41.184
Throughout history,
warriors were heralded.

41:41.361 --> 41:45.764
Stories were told, songs were sung,
statues were built.

41:45.999 --> 41:51.437
Today it's easy to forget the sacrifices
our men and women make

41:51.604 --> 41:55.973
when much of the country is more
concerned with dancing celebrities.

41:56.443 --> 41:58.563
This is starting to sound an awful lot
like a pep talk

41:58.712 --> 42:00.179
in why we keep doing this.

42:00.847 --> 42:02.747
I don't need to tell you that.

42:03.750 --> 42:08.380
No, this is where I give you
a chance to feel better

42:08.555 --> 42:11.285
by granting you a rematch.

42:12.592 --> 42:14.492
Climbing wall.

42:15.095 --> 42:17.063
Ten minutes.

42:18.231 --> 42:20.495
And what makes you think
I want a rematch?

42:22.402 --> 42:26.805
I just thought you'd like to dispel
the rumor going around

42:27.006 --> 42:30.942
that you were owned
when we last met.

42:33.813 --> 42:35.246
Yeah.

42:36.382 --> 42:38.373
You can't hold back, G.
You gotta go for it.

42:38.585 --> 42:40.917
You win up here, not up there.

42:41.121 --> 42:43.817
Don't look. She's just gonna
think you're nervous.

42:44.057 --> 42:45.524
Thank you, coach.

42:45.959 --> 42:49.895
Ha. I'm not nervous, I am resigned.

42:50.096 --> 42:55.090
Come on, Mr. Callen,
I can't hang out up here all night.

42:55.268 --> 42:57.463
Don't want her beating you
before you get to the wall.

42:57.670 --> 43:01.037
- She's already beat me three times.
- Best of seven. You can do it.

43:01.241 --> 43:03.732
- So I can lose one more?
- Where's your fighting spirit, G?

43:03.943 --> 43:06.411
Sam, it's Hetty.

43:12.185 --> 43:13.584
Yeah.

43:14.420 --> 43:15.978
You're screwed.
