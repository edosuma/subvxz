10:03.930 --> 10:08.060
Almost as sad as me not
getting into Moss and Scones!

[ Sobbing ]

10:13.480 --> 10:15.940
That's it, buddy.
Let it out.

[ Sobbing ]

10:21.450 --> 10:23.330
I'm so sad!
[ Sobs ]

10:23.410 --> 10:25.830
I know.
It's been tough.

10:25.910 --> 10:28.210
Well...

10:28.290 --> 10:30.170
I didn't get
into that club.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.540
I've been in the Mortimer Club
my whole life.

10:32.630 --> 10:36.130
I'd love to expand!
[ Sobs ]

10:36.210 --> 10:39.050
[ Gasps ] I think I can help you
with that.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.850
Mortimer.
Yes?

10:43.930 --> 10:45.180
We have a problem.

10:45.260 --> 10:48.560
Something very dear to us
has gone missing,

10:48.640 --> 10:50.980
nowhere to be seen
on this island.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.190
Oh, dear.

10:52.270 --> 10:54.360
This could be very bad
for us.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.440
This could disrupt the very
fabric of our reality,

10:57.530 --> 11:00.700
and an object of our love
could be in very real danger!

11:00.780 --> 11:01.910
Huh?!

11:01.990 --> 11:03.740
I'm talking of course
about my footie pajamas.

11:03.820 --> 11:05.080
I cannot find them.
