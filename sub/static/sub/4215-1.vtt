02:59.096 --> 03:00.096
Don't.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.348
Calm down.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.933
Hey, fuck you.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.935
Calm down.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.853
Fuck you.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.203
Looks like
his chute didn't open.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.600
Single shooter.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.811
How do you know?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.795
Please stop doing that.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.429
You're shooting at
the wrong people.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.765
How do I know?

04:28.018 --> 04:31.770
Because otherwise, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.115
All right.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.326
You wanna show me
the right ones?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.457
Nikolai.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.792
I mean, I'm Nikolai.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.633
What's the last thing
you remember, Nikolai?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.845
War. Yeah.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.388
I was with the Chechnya.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.808
And there was a light.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.145
And then I... Then
I woke up and I was...

05:13.355 --> 05:14.813
Falling.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.817
Yeah, same thing.
I was in Baja.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.819
And then
there was a light.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.030
And then ch ingao.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.749
Where are we?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.836
Maybe she knows.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.340
Shit.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.847
You wanna
lower the weapon?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.519
I've never seen
this jungle.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.188
And I've seen most.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.525
All right, you think
this is Asia?

06:00.026 --> 06:01.110
Maybe Africa?

06:01.278 --> 06:03.570
Too hot for
this time of year.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.031
And the topography
is all wrong.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.701
Amazon, maybe.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.203
I saw more parachutes.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.789
Which way?

06:13.957 --> 06:15.541
Why?

06:20.547 --> 06:24.300
So I can figure out who threw
me out of a fucking airplane.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.560
Fuck.
Where's he going?

06:38.315 --> 06:40.566
All right, let's hit
the fucking road.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.327
Fuck.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.874
You remember a plane?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.754
I woke up in freefall.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.631
You?

07:46.383 --> 07:48.133
Same.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.512
You're IDF?

07:51.596 --> 07:52.888
Yeah.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.973
Are you in
the service?

07:55.975 --> 07:57.309
Not exactly.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.479
You motherfucker.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.232
Come on,
you motherfucker.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.084
You with him?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.210
No.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.385
Then why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

08:32.971 --> 08:34.763
We have bigger problems right now.

08:35.390 --> 08:39.058
Okay, boss.
Whatever you say.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.482
I will finish
what you started.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.699
Strength in numbers, huh?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.617
Something like that.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.702
Yeah?

08:56.911 --> 08:59.538
Maybe we should get that
guy hanging in the tree?

08:59.706 --> 09:02.040
Help me!

09:02.125 --> 09:03.584
Fuck!

09:03.668 --> 09:07.045
Help me! Somebody!

09:08.840 --> 09:10.799
Fuck. Help!

09:12.802 --> 09:14.303
Hello?

09:14.387 --> 09:17.181
I'm trapped in a parachute
in a fucking tree.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.849
Hey, man, why don't
you shut the fuck up?

09:19.434 --> 09:20.893
Oh. Thank God.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.561
I think I can...

09:22.729 --> 09:24.730
Stop moving. You're breaking the branch.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.441
You have anything to
cut yourself down with?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.276
Why would I...
No, I don't.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.361
Look, if we get rope
from one of the chutes...

09:31.446 --> 09:32.571
Do something.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.536
Help!

09:39.621 --> 09:41.163
It was taking too long.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.915
Help!

09:49.172 --> 09:50.714
Who the hell are you?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.258
I'm a doctor.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.011
I was on
my way to work.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.516
Can someone please
just tell me, uh,

10:02.560 --> 10:05.312
what the fuck
is going on here?

10:34.842 --> 10:37.302
Your ass is awesome.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.855
Look.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.407
Goddamn. Who the hell is this guy?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.967
What the hell
is that?

11:27.770 --> 11:29.354
Who would do this?

11:29.939 --> 11:33.317
Whoever they are,
they take trophies.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.361
In my culture

11:36.654 --> 11:38.739
the warrior with
the greatest trophies

11:38.823 --> 11:40.365
commands
the most respect.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.492
Whatever.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.246
It's a test.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.167
To see how we do
under pressure.

11:50.460 --> 11:54.129
If this were a test,
you'd all be military.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.505
Total strangers.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.341
Live rounds.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.010
This is something else.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.012
Maybe it's ransom.

12:02.180 --> 12:06.350
Back in Tijuana,
we kidnap you,

12:06.434 --> 12:08.685
put you in
an oil drum.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.355
The ransom's not paid,

12:12.273 --> 12:14.399
we light you on fire.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.652
I hear these stories

12:16.736 --> 12:19.112
about these experiments
they run on cons.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.530
They stick drugs
in your food

12:20.615 --> 12:22.574
and they sit back
and watch what happens.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.326
Well, it's not drugs.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.787
If it was
a psychotropic compound,

12:26.871 --> 12:28.580
we'd be feeling
the residual side effects.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.417
Loss of motor skills,
blurry vision.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.047
And if it was a behavioral
experiment... I mean, there...

12:37.131 --> 12:38.590
There'd be a point.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.470
What if we are dead?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.187
I was going to be
executed in two days.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.022
And I was in combat.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.109
So was I.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.861
This is hell.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.989
Last time I looked, you didn't
need a parachute to get there.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.785
It doesn't matter
what happened, or why.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.079
We're here.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.792
Only question is,
how do we get out?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.714
Where you going?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.590
To high ground.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.300
We need to
stick together.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.139
Then you should
follow me.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.803
Uh, yeah,
I wouldn't do that.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.979
Yep.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.691
Archaefructus
liaoningensis.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.861
That is really,
really poisonous.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.030
Wouldn't take more
than one scratch

14:25.114 --> 14:27.240
to cause
total paralysis.

14:30.495 --> 14:34.539
Thank you. I'll watch for you out here.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.544
You made a buddy.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.846
Hey.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.808
We need to rest.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.894
So rest.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.564
You look like
you could use it, too.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.069
You got a name?

15:07.990 --> 15:09.783
Look.

15:09.867 --> 15:13.161
I'm sorry. You want to
play scout leader, great.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.956
All right? You wanna
follow me, fine.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.041
But I'm not doing this.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.710
I'm better on my own.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.464
Wanna see
something fucked up?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.905
Well, between that
and the sun,

15:49.991 --> 15:52.033
I'd say we have
a real problem.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.869
What about the sun?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.247
Hasn't moved
since we got here.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.339
What do you think
is really going on?

16:09.927 --> 16:11.803
What do I think?

16:14.891 --> 16:16.516
Spetsnaz.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.351
Alpha Group.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.521
Los Zetas,
cartel enforcer.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.899
RUF.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.568
It's a death squad
from Sierra Leone.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.029
Yakuza, Inagawa-kai.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.198
And the FBI's
Most Wanted.

16:32.283 --> 16:35.410
And him.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.998
They're all heavy-hitters.
He doesn't belong.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.584
Belong to what?

16:45.671 --> 16:48.089
I'd say we were chosen.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.221
What about you?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.350
What about me?

17:01.187 --> 17:05.272
You know the jungle.
Know the players.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.278
I'm guessing ex-military.
Black ops.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.156
Probably a mercenary.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.241
You got a problem
with that?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.829
Not at the moment.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.125
Good.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.605
Something was
dropped here.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.483
Same as us.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.111
Not the same as us.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.870
You said
we were chosen.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.124
Chosen for what?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.545
Oh, shit.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.956
Looking good there, boss.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.755
Look out!

20:15.840 --> 20:16.923
Down!

20:20.386 --> 20:21.761
Shit!

20:41.907 --> 20:42.991
Help!

20:43.075 --> 20:44.075
Shit.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.212
Damn it.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.827
12 o'clock.
110 meters.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.746
Take him. Take him.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.581
I don't have to.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.294
Don't have to.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.929
We triggered
a dead man's trap.

21:48.474 --> 21:53.186
It's two weeks, judging from
the rate of decomposition.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.813
He took up
a position here.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.986
Shooting in all directions.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.656
This was a last stand.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.540
United States
Special Forces.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.793
This is strange.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.838
He is supposed to be
deployed in Afghanistan.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.675
What's he doing here,
setting traps for us?

22:24.009 --> 22:26.052
They weren't meant for us.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.347
He was hunting
something else.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.266
Something a lot bigger.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.142
Bigger?

22:34.228 --> 22:36.104
The trunk was a deadfall.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.647
Rule of thumb
with a deadfall

22:37.731 --> 22:40.733
is you set the weight five
times that of the target animal.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.195
Whatever it was, it got
through the trip wires.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.030
And it did this.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.162
Let's move.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.102
What is it?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.564
What is it?

23:27.906 --> 23:29.615
Nothing.

23:40.461 --> 23:44.589
What is it?
Nothing. Nothing.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.215
Nothing.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.454
We're gonna need
a new plan.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.892
Hey, where are we going?

25:19.977 --> 25:22.270
Someone put us
on this rock.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.772
There's got to be
a way off it.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.984
What the fuck?

25:33.031 --> 25:35.450
You know what?
Fuck this.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.243
This is bullshit, man.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.870
I want a gun.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.581
Come on, man, you got two
motherfucking guns, man.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.374
Somebody give me a gun.

25:44.042 --> 25:48.171
Come on, Russian.
You got a big fucking gun.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.509
Come on, man.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.970
Give me a gun.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.015
Give me your gun.
Right now.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.351
Give me your gun.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.068
I'm ready to die.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.405
Are you?

27:27.729 --> 27:28.854
Oh.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.487
Help!

27:45.205 --> 27:47.999
Oh, shit!

27:49.334 --> 27:50.418
Oh.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.461
Shit! Fuck!

28:11.356 --> 28:12.356
Help!

28:15.444 --> 28:18.195
Fuck you! Fuck you!

28:25.162 --> 28:26.621
Looking good there, boss.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.970
Go! Go!

28:43.055 --> 28:44.889
Come on. Come on.

28:54.316 --> 28:55.733
Oh, shit!

29:04.451 --> 29:05.785
Come on!

29:08.914 --> 29:09.955
No!

29:41.154 --> 29:43.280
As bad as you are,

29:44.658 --> 29:46.742
those things are worse.

30:04.928 --> 30:08.139
So they... They just, what, left?

30:09.349 --> 30:10.433
No.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.268
The whistle.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.478
They were called.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.897
All right, listen up.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.191
Everybody do
a shell count.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.736
We got to
conserve ammunition.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.655
Reload. Do it now.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.743
Excuse me. Just what the
hell is going on here?

30:30.036 --> 30:31.537
We're being hunted.

30:34.708 --> 30:38.461
The cages. The soldier. All of us.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.673
All brought here
for the same purpose.

30:44.593 --> 30:47.052
This planet is
a game preserve.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.638
And we're the game.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.686
In case you didn't notice,

30:55.771 --> 30:58.481
we just got flushed out.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.067
They sent the dogs in,

31:02.152 --> 31:04.862
just like you would
if you were stalking boar

31:04.946 --> 31:06.197
or shooting quail.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.700
They split us apart
and they watched.

31:09.785 --> 31:10.868
Testing us.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.376
How do you know this?

31:20.504 --> 31:22.046
Because

31:22.756 --> 31:24.590
that's what I would do.

31:27.469 --> 31:28.636
Fantastic.

31:29.471 --> 31:30.721
Wait.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.433
There are only
seven of us.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.603
Help me!

31:47.697 --> 31:49.240
Help!

32:16.309 --> 32:17.560
Help.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.982
Wait.
What?

32:24.359 --> 32:26.193
It's a trap.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.414
Help me.

32:52.846 --> 32:54.138
Fuck me.

32:55.849 --> 32:57.516
Help.

33:01.479 --> 33:02.980
Wound one man.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.401
Make him suffer.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.654
Make him bleed.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.409
Make him
call out for help,

33:15.493 --> 33:19.246
and set a trap and kill those who come.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.628
I know because
I have done this.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.424
So we're gonna leave him here, right?

33:31.384 --> 33:35.179
Come on, look at him. He's done.

33:35.805 --> 33:39.308
There's nothing else
we can do, right?

33:39.392 --> 33:40.893
Right?

33:48.610 --> 33:49.818
We leave him.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.905
I can't.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.908
Then, that's on you.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.427
Help me.

34:38.702 --> 34:41.870
Help me.

34:52.047 --> 34:54.049
Help me. Help me.

34:54.134 --> 34:56.510
It's a trap. It's a trap.
It's a trap.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.658
What are we gonna do?

35:20.952 --> 35:23.287
We should go to
higher ground.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.747
Really?

35:25.081 --> 35:27.041
We're trapped on
an alien hunting planet.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.252
You really think the
solution is to walk more?

35:34.632 --> 35:36.633
It wants us to run.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.637
That's how it hunts.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.435
This is its jungle.

35:47.437 --> 35:49.271
Its game.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.316
Its rules.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.320
We run,

35:57.781 --> 35:59.281
we die.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.327
What's
the alternative?

36:04.579 --> 36:07.247
We need to know
who we're dealing with.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.918
Dog tracks go that way.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.464
We go after it.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.109
Well?

36:35.985 --> 36:38.028
No movement.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.401
It looks like we're not the
only things being hunted.

39:43.256 --> 39:44.548
Holy shit!

39:45.633 --> 39:46.925
What the fuck?

39:47.010 --> 39:48.677
What the fuck
is that thing?

39:49.804 --> 39:52.723
This is a mistake.
We have to leave. Now.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.517
Where is
the tough guy?

40:00.189 --> 40:01.898
He left us.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.152
He's here.

40:22.712 --> 40:25.130
Run!

41:05.630 --> 41:08.090
Run! Run! Run!

42:59.952 --> 43:02.078
You set us up.

43:03.706 --> 43:06.082
He led us into
that death camp,

43:06.167 --> 43:08.752
then hid and waited
for that thing to strike.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.254
We were bait.

43:12.757 --> 43:15.425
I needed to know
who we were up against.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.761
Now I do.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.096
A man is dead
because of that.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.600
This morning you were
ready to kill him.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.269
It ain't this
goddamn morning, is it?

43:26.354 --> 43:28.188
At least he didn't
die in vain.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.398
Why? So we could
find out firsthand

43:30.483 --> 43:32.984
what it feels like
to have our asses kicked?

43:33.069 --> 43:35.695
No. We found out that
there's more than one of them.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.657
That they use projectile
and energy-based weapons.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.867
That they have some sort
of cloaking device.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.786
That they're bigger than us,

43:42.870 --> 43:45.622
stronger,
but also heavier.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.627
You put us at risk
for yourself.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.296
You want to be
on your own,

43:54.131 --> 43:55.131
you got it.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.300
Why don't you tell
them the truth?

43:57.760 --> 43:59.052
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:59.136 --> 44:00.136
You know what
I'm talking about.

44:00.221 --> 44:01.972
The way you looked at that
thing that was strung up,

44:02.056 --> 44:04.349
the way you reacted.

44:05.309 --> 44:09.062
She knows what it is.
Don't you?

44:28.624 --> 44:30.250
We don't have
a name for them.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.757
'87, Guatemala.

44:40.052 --> 44:43.263
A spec ops team
went into the jungle.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.848
High end.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.726
Six men plus
a CIA liaison.

44:48.519 --> 44:50.478
Only one made it out.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.356
In his debrief,

44:53.441 --> 44:56.401
he said they came in
contact with something.

44:56.485 --> 44:58.987
He gave a detailed
description.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.657
The thing
on the totem.

45:05.494 --> 45:09.623
It wore some kind of camouflage
that adjusted to ambient light.

45:09.707 --> 45:12.584
Made it nearly invisible
in our spectrum.

45:13.377 --> 45:16.087
It could see
in infrared.

45:16.172 --> 45:18.298
Heat signatures.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.509
He used mud
to block his.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.762
That's how
he beat it.

45:26.140 --> 45:29.476
It hunted and
killed his team,

45:32.938 --> 45:34.564
one by one.

45:37.276 --> 45:39.110
Whatever it is,

45:40.446 --> 45:42.322
wherever they're from,

45:44.116 --> 45:46.368
we're going to
kill them all.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.871
We set up
a defensive perimeter.

45:49.955 --> 45:52.248
Make it look like
we are holing up.

45:52.333 --> 45:54.167
That'll bring them to us.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.753
We force them into
a choke point.

45:56.837 --> 45:59.714
We get them in
overlapping fields of fire.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.050
It can be done.

46:04.261 --> 46:06.596
I can't do it alone.

46:41.924 --> 46:44.926
You know, man, if we ever make it home,

46:45.302 --> 46:48.430
I'm gonna do so much
fucking cocaine.

46:49.724 --> 46:52.100
I'm gonna rape
so many fine bitches.

46:53.686 --> 46:56.229
I'll be like, "What time is it? 5:00?

46:56.897 --> 46:58.398
"Damn.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.317
"Time to go rape me
some fine bitches. "

47:01.402 --> 47:02.694
You know what
I'm saying?

47:02.862 --> 47:05.071
Oh, yeah. Totally.

47:05.156 --> 47:07.824
Like, 5:00,

47:08.993 --> 47:10.744
it's bitch-raping time.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.203
Mmm.

47:12.413 --> 47:13.580
Yeah.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.216
You should stay away from him. Yeah.

47:36.896 --> 47:38.146
You still pissed?

47:39.273 --> 47:40.690
Fuck you.

47:53.954 --> 47:56.372
You know what the difference
between you and me is?

47:57.917 --> 48:00.460
We both do
the same thing.

48:00.753 --> 48:02.128
You just do it
for a country,

48:02.213 --> 48:04.631
so you don't have to admit you like it.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.635
What happened to you?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.887
What made you
so fucked up?

48:14.558 --> 48:18.228
"There is no hunting
like the hunting of a man.

48:18.604 --> 48:21.648
"And those who've hunted
armed men long enough,

48:22.107 --> 48:24.234
"and like it,

48:24.318 --> 48:27.403
"never really care for
anything else thereafter. "

48:30.407 --> 48:32.408
That's pretty poetic.

48:33.953 --> 48:36.746
Did you come up with
that all by yourself?

48:36.831 --> 48:38.832
No, actually.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.418
That was Hemingway.

49:20.541 --> 49:21.541
Fuck.

49:24.628 --> 49:25.962
Why isn't it coming?

49:29.383 --> 49:31.384
They see our traps.

49:48.694 --> 49:50.069
Hey, Doc.

49:50.154 --> 49:51.779
Hey.

49:51.864 --> 49:55.325
I think I just figured out
a way you can be useful.

50:04.835 --> 50:06.878
Shit. Shit.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.632
I hate this. I hate this. I hate this.

50:10.716 --> 50:12.008
Oh!

50:17.056 --> 50:18.932
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

50:21.226 --> 50:22.477
Oh, shit!

50:22.561 --> 50:23.686
Come on. Come on.

50:23.771 --> 50:25.521
Fucking shoot!

50:27.024 --> 50:28.191
Shoot already!

50:39.036 --> 50:40.703
Fuck

50:41.914 --> 50:43.915
all of you!

50:52.591 --> 50:56.552
Is he dead? Why ain't
you smiling? Oh, shit.

50:57.262 --> 50:59.055
The thing
from the cages.

50:59.139 --> 51:01.975
Maybe it thought we're the
ones who dropped it here.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.940
Good shot, though.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.403
I missed.

51:21.286 --> 51:23.621
Over here.

51:27.584 --> 51:29.502
Over here.

51:37.594 --> 51:38.803
Over here.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.811
Turn around.

51:57.781 --> 52:00.616
What the fuck are you?

52:12.004 --> 52:13.629
I'm alive.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.014
You talk too loud.

52:29.980 --> 52:32.732
Smelled you
since you got here.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.236
If I can smell you,

52:37.321 --> 52:39.489
if I can hear you,

52:40.574 --> 52:42.075
they can, too.

52:47.164 --> 52:50.083
Storm coming soon.
This way.

52:51.168 --> 52:52.710
Wait.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.006
Who are you?

52:59.176 --> 53:01.594
Noland,

53:01.678 --> 53:04.097
run away,

53:04.181 --> 53:07.225
live to fight
another day.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.773
I'm the one
that got away.

53:15.776 --> 53:18.027
The one you
don't fuck with.

54:46.450 --> 54:47.909
Come on.

54:47.993 --> 54:50.494
Feel the vibe
of this place.

55:05.302 --> 55:06.552
Where are we?

55:06.637 --> 55:09.639
It's a drill
somebody left behind.

55:09.723 --> 55:14.268
The machine is dead,
but the power source ain't.

56:17.874 --> 56:19.625
Wow,
what a shithole.

56:19.710 --> 56:20.960
You live here?

56:21.044 --> 56:25.840
Oh, no. No.
This is my summer home.

56:25.924 --> 56:28.092
I winter in the Riviera.

56:28.176 --> 56:31.304
The schools are
so much nicer there.

56:31.388 --> 56:32.596
And the men...

56:33.223 --> 56:34.598
Ooh, la, la!

56:36.101 --> 56:38.602
By the way,
you're welcome.

56:39.271 --> 56:41.605
How have you survived?

56:46.403 --> 56:50.489
Salvaging what I can,
when I can,

56:50.574 --> 56:53.576
from whatever I can.

56:55.537 --> 56:56.662
Oh.

56:58.206 --> 57:00.666
Noland, Ronald.

57:00.751 --> 57:03.169
Air Cav.

57:03.253 --> 57:05.171
They...

57:05.255 --> 57:07.048
They drop you
all in, too?

57:07.924 --> 57:09.884
Yeah.

57:10.093 --> 57:12.136
Hmm.

57:12.888 --> 57:14.638
What a rush.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.398
Hey.

57:24.483 --> 57:26.192
Yeah, I'll tell him.

57:26.276 --> 57:30.946
Hey, Agent Orange,
you wanna put that down?

57:31.031 --> 57:32.198
Certain people
around here

57:32.282 --> 57:33.407
are particular
about other people

57:33.492 --> 57:34.617
messing with their shit.

57:36.119 --> 57:37.703
Very important, though.

57:37.788 --> 57:41.207
Disrupts the
heat signature.

57:41.291 --> 57:43.084
You motherfuckers.

57:45.712 --> 57:47.630
So, you killed one?

57:48.465 --> 57:49.465
Uh-uh.

57:49.549 --> 57:51.634
I killed two.

57:53.011 --> 57:54.470
Maybe three.

57:55.222 --> 57:57.807
I can't remember. Anyway,

57:59.726 --> 58:02.436
there's two different types
of them out there.

58:02.521 --> 58:05.106
Hmm? Now they're similar,
but they're different.

58:05.190 --> 58:08.025
It's kind of like the difference
between dogs and wolves.

58:08.485 --> 58:11.404
The ones that are
running things up there,

58:11.488 --> 58:14.240
the larger ones,
hunt the smaller ones.

58:14.324 --> 58:17.243
It's some kind of
blood feud, I guess.

58:17.327 --> 58:19.703
Been going on
for a long time.

58:22.165 --> 58:23.749
They do this
just for sport?

58:23.834 --> 58:27.837
Oh, yeah, they bring in fresh
meat season after season.

58:27.921 --> 58:30.423
I mean, shit you
wouldn't believe.

58:31.383 --> 58:33.092
Bring it in,

58:33.176 --> 58:37.471
and hunt it and kill it. In that order.

58:39.558 --> 58:41.725
How long you
been here, man?

58:43.103 --> 58:44.186
Uh...

58:45.272 --> 58:48.357
Seven seasons, I think.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.444
What? Ten?

58:52.028 --> 58:53.362
Damn.

58:53.447 --> 58:57.366
Anyway, every once in a while,
one of us kills one of them.

58:58.285 --> 59:01.954
And, let me tell you, that's
when they get real interested.

59:02.038 --> 59:06.208
See, they learn quick.
They adapt.

59:07.711 --> 59:10.171
They develop a whole new set of skills.

59:10.255 --> 59:15.050
They come back the next season
in threes, always in threes.

59:15.135 --> 59:17.178
Their armor
might've changed,

59:17.262 --> 59:20.014
or their weapons
have changed,

59:20.098 --> 59:22.391
or their tactics
have changed.

59:23.727 --> 59:25.394
It's amazing.

59:25.979 --> 59:27.938
So, it's like evolution.

59:29.149 --> 59:32.818
They're trying to make
themselves into better killers.

59:33.320 --> 59:34.570
Mmm-hmm.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.948
You said they come back.

59:40.118 --> 59:41.327
How?

59:41.620 --> 59:43.412
They got a ship.

59:43.747 --> 59:44.914
A ship?

59:44.998 --> 59:45.998
Yeah.

59:46.082 --> 59:48.375
It's 30 yards
from their camp.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.088
I told you
they wouldn't see it.

59:53.465 --> 59:55.132
I told you
they wouldn't.

59:55.217 --> 59:56.342
You were there.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.597
You could've helped us.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:06.977
How do we kill them?

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:11.106
However you can.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.276
They must have
a weakness.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:17.821
Not many.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:23.869
You want to survive? You
dig in deep. You stay hid.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.956
Yeah, well, we're gonna
go with door number two.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.958
How do we get out
of this valley?

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.501
Oh.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.795
Ten seasons.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.131
First two seasons... No,
three seasons I was here,

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.884
I was walking
in the same direction,

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:42.304
trying to reach the
edge of the preserve.

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:48.519
Let me tell you something,

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:51.230
there ain't no edge
of the preserve.

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:57.278
Maybe you and your friend
wanna tell me about that ship?

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.198
Let's see.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.620
That's a brilliant idea.
Brilliant.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.917
The whole time I've been
here, it never occurred to me

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.044
to commandeer
the alien spacecraft.

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:18.340
But I wouldn't know
how to fly it.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.302
He would.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.637
Of course,
you know how to fly.

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:25.931
I'll give it a shot.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.061
Well...

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.732
I'm gonna get
some sleep.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:38.319
No noise.
They're out there.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:41.322
They're always
out there.

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.909
Water in there.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:51.165
Help yourself.
All of you.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:16.023
Who's that?

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.984
My kids.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:24.948
Big one, Ilya.
And that's Sascha.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:32.623
Uh...

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.836
This is, uh, Candy Lee.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.465
Tits like howitzers.

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:45.594
Is that your girlfriend?

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.348
No. It's my sister.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:10.577
This is old.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.788
Very old.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.833
They've been doing this
for a long time.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.293
You speak English.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.963
Yes.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:24.133
Why don't you
say more?

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.640
Because I talk too much.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.708
Thanks.

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:12.723
Do you know what I was
doing when I was taken?

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:19.271
Isaac, my spotter.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.857
He was caught.

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:24.193
I could have
done something,

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.403
but then I would have been
slaughtered along with him.

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:29.490
So, I hid.

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:32.910
I watched him die.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.751
I wish I pulled
that trigger.

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:43.337
You do what you have to,
to survive.

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:46.882
You said we were chosen.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.469
I asked, "For what?"

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.140
I should've asked why.

01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:58.268
It's because
we are predators.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.355
Just like them.

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:05.692
We're the monsters
of our own world.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.489
It's probably better that
we're never going back.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.366
I am going back.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.373
I'm going
after that ship.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.586
You learn how to fly it in
the last hour and not tell me?

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:26.338
No.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:30.008
That thing strung up
at the camp might know.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:34.221
My guess is, it'd do just
about anything to get free.

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:38.267
Enemy of my enemy.

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:41.103
That doesn't
make it a friend.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.610
So what
do I call you?

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.286
Smoke.

01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:59.371
Hey, smoke.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:01.707
Fuck.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.214
Where's Noland?

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:13.969
He's a scavenger.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.596
He wants what we have.

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:28.150
Come on!
There must be a way out!

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:32.362
Damn it.
Do it!

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.323
You see the shit you've
gotten us into, man?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.075
I told you that. You
never listen to me, though.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.494
Six more. Six more fucking
mouths to feed.

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:41.830
I can barely stand
living with you.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:44.458
How am I gonna
live with them, too?

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.336
Damn it!

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:48.837
What?

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.964
Say goodbye to
your little friend.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:56.011
You're in my house,
motherfucker!

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:00.933
Get down.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.815
Yeah, that didn't
open up shit.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:12.069
Wasn't meant to, asshole.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.196
I'm calling in
the cavalry.

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.206
How the fuck
can we get out of here?

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.752
Open up,
you hanky fucker.

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:51.733
Come on!

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.365
Oh.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.867
Finally found me,
huh, big dog?

01:08:02.036 --> 01:08:04.997
Well, what took
you so long?

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.003
It's not gonna open!

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.173
God damn it!

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:47.913
It's toying with us.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.267
Guys?

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:32.477
Oh, shit.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.617
Hey!

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.875
This way.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:44.466
Hey!

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:48.511
I lost you guys!

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.017
You got to get me
out of here, man.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.519
Come on. Come on.

01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:58.980
Let's move.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.760
Oh...

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.186
Oh!

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:30.840
We killed it.

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:34.219
We killed it!
We fucking...

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:38.056
We fucking killed it.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.058
We killed it. Whoo!

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.268
We fucking killed it.
Huh?

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:46.606
Who's your daddy now,
motherfucker?

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:48.149
Hunt my dick, bitch!

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.584
Die, you space faggot!

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.253
Who do you think
you're dealing with, hoss?

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.587
Is that all you've got?

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.840
Go! Go!

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.103
Come on.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.772
Come on!

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.559
Let's get to
that ship.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:30.640
We're close. Come on.

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:33.976
Ow! Shit!

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.021
Shit.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:43.778
Fuck!

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:52.495
Another inch, it would've
hit my tibial artery.

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:54.247
I guess this
is my lucky day.

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:57.458
It isn't. That trap
wasn't meant to kill.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:19:59.794
It was meant to maim.

01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:02.505
He's dead weight.
Come on.

01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:03.881
Uh, um...

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:07.885
No, I can still walk.

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.638
Oh!
Shit. God.

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:12.390
No, he can't. Look.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.350
He's done.

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:16.185
You're gonna beg us
to slow down.

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:18.855
No, no, no.
To carry you.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.609
You can't leave me here.

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:26.446
You can't.
I have a family.

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:29.490
I got kids.

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:31.617
I'm sorry.

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:36.080
We need to go.

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.540
No. No!

01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:39.667
You are taking me
with you!

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:41.043
Look, you and I
can still make it.

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:43.087
We use him.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:44.672
We booby-trap him.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:47.049
No.

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.635
They'll go to him
to take trophies.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.679
This is our last chance.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:53.806
This isn't right.
He's one of us!

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:54.891
He is.

01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:56.642
That's what
they're counting on.

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:59.270
They want you to feel
something for this man.

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.980
To be human.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.608
And what are you?

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:05.902
Alive.

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:10.156
What's that worth?

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.200
You can't. Please.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:14.035
Please,
I'm begging you.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:15.787
Please.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:16.996
You should go.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.214
Shit.

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.430
You should've gone with him. I know.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:02.917
Hey.

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:30.778
I want off this planet.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:35.449
You understand me?

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:40.121
I'll cut you down.

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:43.124
You take me
to the ship.

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:45.459
Ship.

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:51.048
You understand me,
don't you?

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.428
Huh?

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:30.630
I'm sorry.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.340
We're not dead yet.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.552
Shit.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:22.736
I guess he made it.

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:39.503
If you could
do it over again,

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:43.424
would you make
the same choice?

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.429
Yes.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:04.111
Thank you.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:08.532
When the time comes,

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:11.452
I'll do us both.

01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:14.997
I promise
it'll be quick.

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:17.333
No.

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:22.087
It won't.

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.063
Cool.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:43.108
That's right.

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:46.487
It's a neurotoxin.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:48.948
There's so many to
choose from around here.

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.825
But don't worry.
It's not fatal.

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:55.579
You'll be able to
experience everything.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:32.157
I guess now you realize
why they chose me.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:36.620
I was right in front of
you guys the whole time.

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:38.956
Just watching you.

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:42.084
Earning your trust.

01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:48.716
You couldn't see me
for what I really am.

01:29:50.093 --> 01:29:52.136
You see, back home,

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.138
I'm a murderer.

01:29:56.683 --> 01:29:58.058
I'm a freak.

01:29:59.519 --> 01:30:00.728
But here,

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.731
among the monsters,

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:09.737
I'm normal.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.573
I like it here.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.034
I wanna stay.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.807
Oh! You came back.

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:41.769
I missed my ride.

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:44.396
Oh, thank God.

01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:45.939
Help us get out of here.

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:08.128
She's paralyzed.

01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:11.715
It gave her something.
I don't know what,

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.051
but it paralyzed her.

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:19.306
Come on.

01:31:37.784 --> 01:31:40.828
You're so busy
taking care of others,

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.704
you forgot to look out for yourself.

01:31:44.582 --> 01:31:46.166
We're getting
out of here.

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:48.335
You just hang
tight, okay?

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:50.629
I didn't think
you'd come back.

01:31:52.382 --> 01:31:54.258
But she,

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.635
she never lost
faith in you.

01:31:57.554 --> 01:31:59.388
I guess I owe you
an apology.

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:04.017
You are a good man
after all.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:06.854
No.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:08.897
I'm not.

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:15.070
But I'm fast.

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:31.962
Come here.

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:40.429
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

01:32:40.972 --> 01:32:42.306
I won't.

01:33:57.423 --> 01:33:58.924
Help me.

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:02.261
I'm one of you.

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:35.752
Yes.

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:38.171
Come on. Come on.

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:41.883
Come on.
Come on. Do it.

01:34:42.635 --> 01:34:44.094
I'm here. Kill me.

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:47.931
Come on.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.516
Do it now. Kill me!

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:01.797
Oh, shit.

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:57.180
Did you get it?

01:38:57.974 --> 01:38:59.307
Yeah.

01:39:12.405 --> 01:39:14.072
I'm Royce.

01:39:17.076 --> 01:39:19.286
Nice to meet you, Royce.

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:23.290
I'm Isabelle.

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:51.378
Now,

01:40:52.421 --> 01:40:55.590
let's find a way off
this fucking planet.

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:20.657
Don't tell Aunt Mary
about Uncle John

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:23.034
He claims he has the music
But he has a lot of fun

01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:26.997
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

01:41:27.081 --> 01:41:32.794
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

01:41:32.878 --> 01:41:35.505
Well, long, tall Sally
She's built sweet

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:38.174
She's got everything
that Uncle John needs

01:41:38.259 --> 01:41:42.178
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

01:41:42.263 --> 01:41:48.018
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:51.021
Well, I saw Uncle John
with bald-head Sally

01:41:51.105 --> 01:41:53.398
He saw Aunt Mary coming and
he ducked back in the alley

01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:57.402
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

01:41:57.486 --> 01:42:02.866
Oh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.075
Ahhh!

01:42:17.548 --> 01:42:20.341
Well, long, tall Sally
She's built sweet

01:42:20.426 --> 01:42:23.219
She's got everything
that Uncle John needs

01:42:23.304 --> 01:42:27.223
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

01:42:27.308 --> 01:42:32.020
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight

01:42:32.104 --> 01:42:35.690
Have some fun
Having me some fun tonight

01:46:51.113 --> 01:46:52.113
