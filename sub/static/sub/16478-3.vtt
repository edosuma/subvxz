Susan, run!

How come Brody called
you back but not me?

01:30.107 --> 01:31.438
Well, you didn't call.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.840
You texted,
that's different.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.042
How so?

01:34.044 --> 01:36.177
Really? Okay.

01:36.179 --> 01:40.048
When you want to see
one of your many lady friends,

01:40.050 --> 01:41.883
do you call or text?

01:41.885 --> 01:44.126
Well, first off, I don't have
many lady friends.

01:44.127 --> 01:44.616
Hmm.

01:44.620 --> 01:46.754
Or any, for that matter.

01:46.756 --> 01:48.254
Second, what's your point?

01:48.256 --> 01:49.856
My point is,

01:49.858 --> 01:52.793
calls get return calls,
texts return texts.

01:52.795 --> 01:55.696
Welcome to the 21st century,
Country Mouse.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.732
Still can't figure out that
"Country Mouse" thing.

01:59.601 --> 02:01.334
Not sure I want to.

02:01.336 --> 02:03.770
What are you
still doing here?

02:03.772 --> 02:04.904
I'm working.

02:04.906 --> 02:06.271
By the way,
I can't find the Java,

02:06.273 --> 02:08.273
so if you're gonna make some,
I'll take a cup.

02:08.275 --> 02:10.275
Uh, excuse me.

02:10.276 --> 02:11.610
That's Brody's desk.

02:11.612 --> 02:12.945
Didn't she quit?

02:15.983 --> 02:18.017
What's going on?

02:18.019 --> 02:19.752
Made the decision last night.

02:19.754 --> 02:21.187
Wanted to tell you both
in person.

02:21.189 --> 02:23.621
Uh, what decision is that?

02:23.623 --> 02:25.456
Talked to Isler.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.392
Borrowing Gregorio from FBI
for a bit.

02:28.394 --> 02:29.694
Until we can identify

02:29.696 --> 02:32.530
cartel imbeds DC wants
out of NOLA.

02:32.532 --> 02:34.565
Is there a pending case?
No.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.601
But we don't know which cases
lead to the cartel

02:36.603 --> 02:37.769
till we're working on them.

02:37.771 --> 02:41.504
Figured best to join forces
for now.

02:45.544 --> 02:47.477
Coffee?
Love some.

02:47.479 --> 02:48.946
Cream?

02:50.983 --> 02:53.250
Well, ain't they chummy.

02:56.821 --> 03:01.824
King, are you sure this is
a good idea, bringing her in?

03:01.826 --> 03:05.094
We keep working the same beat in
a town this small, Christopher,

03:05.096 --> 03:07.363
someone's bound to get caught
in the crossfire.

03:07.365 --> 03:08.898
Can't let that happen.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.033
Yeah. I get that.

03:11.035 --> 03:15.003
I also get that once you let the
fox in the henhouse,

03:15.005 --> 03:16.704
you ain't getting it out.

03:16.706 --> 03:19.207
We have our own way of doing
things down here.

03:19.209 --> 03:20.776
All right, we call
our own shots.

03:20.778 --> 03:22.443
No bureaucracy, no bull.

03:22.445 --> 03:25.247
That's how we keep this city
and service members safe.

03:25.249 --> 03:28.083
How we do things
isn't gonna change.

03:28.085 --> 03:30.484
But how we do things
is what got us reviewed

03:30.486 --> 03:32.019
by DC in the first place.

03:32.021 --> 03:34.688
Look, just because
the FBI cleared us,

03:34.690 --> 03:37.057
doesn't mean they won't
try to indict us again.

03:37.059 --> 03:38.525
I hear ya.

03:38.527 --> 03:44.765
Fastest way to get Gregorio
and the FBI back to DC

03:44.767 --> 03:46.733
is to root out the cartel.

03:46.735 --> 03:49.368
And the fastest way to do that
is to work together.

03:55.010 --> 03:58.377
<i>Sorry. I'm still</i>
<i>playing catch-up here.</i>

03:58.379 --> 04:01.014
When you guys finish a case,
doesn't it get reviewed?

04:01.016 --> 04:02.381
Pride reviews it.

04:02.383 --> 04:04.482
Right.
But who reviews him?

04:04.484 --> 04:08.187
Girl. I give you a week.

04:08.189 --> 04:09.487
Dead sailor.

04:09.489 --> 04:12.124
1501 Dave Dixon Drive.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.592
Hey, isn't that right
next to the Superdome?

04:14.594 --> 04:16.261
Yep.
Let's go. I'm driving.

04:17.397 --> 04:20.199
You keep your weapon
in a file cabinet?

04:20.201 --> 04:22.233
A locked file cabinet.

04:24.403 --> 04:25.837
Dead sailor.

04:27.073 --> 04:28.706
That means you're with us.

04:28.708 --> 04:31.408
Right.

04:33.479 --> 04:37.315
The victim's Petty Officer
Collin Barrett, 41,

04:37.317 --> 04:40.583
from Naval Air Station Joint
Reserve Base in Belle Chasse.

04:40.585 --> 04:43.453
Now it says here he's done
multiple tours of duty,

04:43.455 --> 04:45.021
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

04:45.023 --> 04:48.558
Recipient of the Bronze Star
for bravery,

04:48.560 --> 04:51.061
and not a single strike
against him on his record.

04:51.063 --> 04:52.929
King.

04:52.931 --> 04:54.130
Excuse me.

04:54.132 --> 04:56.031
Oh, hey, Alex.
Hey.

04:56.033 --> 04:57.799
How you doing?
Good. Good to see you.

04:57.801 --> 04:59.351
Wish it was under
better circumstances.

04:59.352 --> 04:59.857
Yeah.

04:59.871 --> 05:02.637
Your men get anything
from surveillance cams?

05:02.639 --> 05:03.839
No. No, they didn't.

05:03.841 --> 05:05.207
It looks like they
were all offline.

05:05.209 --> 05:06.708
We're questioning
arena security

05:06.710 --> 05:08.377
as we speak, though.
All right, thanks.

05:08.379 --> 05:09.544
- You find anything, let us know.
- All right.

05:09.546 --> 05:11.280
Will do.
See you soon.

05:11.282 --> 05:13.381
Wait. Don't touch that.

05:13.383 --> 05:15.449
Don't you have to wait for
the evidence response team?

05:15.451 --> 05:18.452
God. You are not
in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

05:18.454 --> 05:21.289
Down in these here parts

05:21.291 --> 05:22.690
we're CSI, SWAT,

05:22.692 --> 05:24.825
SVU all rolled into one.
Really?

05:24.827 --> 05:26.928
Telling me you specialize
in all those fields?

05:26.930 --> 05:30.264
We don't have the divisions
and resources FBI has.

05:30.266 --> 05:31.498
We make do.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.968
Of course, I guess how we
make do is why DC's

05:34.970 --> 05:36.870
- so concerned with us.
- Oh. Maybe.

05:36.872 --> 05:40.007
Just a different way
of doing things is all.

05:40.009 --> 05:41.942
We're a one-stop shop.

05:41.944 --> 05:43.576
Get you a hat, if you'd like.

05:43.578 --> 05:46.245
Two stops if you
need my findings.

05:46.247 --> 05:49.115
He has defensive wounds
on his hands.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.952
Suggests a definite altercation.

05:52.954 --> 05:56.289
And this oval-shaped tear
along his neck,

05:57.992 --> 06:00.126
looks like he was grazed
by a bullet.

06:00.128 --> 06:02.261
It wasn't a bullet
that killed him, though.

06:02.263 --> 06:04.662
No. As a matter
of fact...

06:04.664 --> 06:06.431
He fell.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.666
Uh, ya think?

06:09.937 --> 06:12.537
If this is the bullet
that grazed him,

06:12.539 --> 06:15.673
judging by the depth
and angle of entry,

06:15.675 --> 06:17.742
the gunman was up there, too.

06:17.744 --> 06:22.779
Must have taken his shot from
the catwalk, 11 o'clock-ish.

06:22.781 --> 06:24.448
What she said.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.550
Follow me.

06:29.422 --> 06:30.955
Bullet markings.
Four of them.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.389
One, two...

06:35.261 --> 06:37.793
Three... four.

06:38.997 --> 06:42.432
This one indicates the shot
was fired from behind Barrett.

06:42.434 --> 06:44.133
Had to be close range, too.

06:44.135 --> 06:45.468
The killer must have
surprised him.

06:45.470 --> 06:46.769
And then they scuffled.

06:46.771 --> 06:49.638
Then, Barrett fell over
the ledge.

06:51.042 --> 06:53.609
Tried grabbing the railing
before he took the plunge.

06:53.611 --> 06:56.044
Question is, what was he
doing here to begin with?

06:56.046 --> 06:58.146
Well, the question also is,

06:58.148 --> 07:01.249
who else was up here with him
and why?

07:02.486 --> 07:04.353
It could be that rifle
will give us some clues.

07:08.258 --> 07:09.524
Just saying.

07:09.526 --> 07:12.326
Right.
All right, Gregorio.

07:12.328 --> 07:14.528
Get that rifle to Sebastian.

07:14.530 --> 07:16.830
See if he can get us any leads,
find out who it belongs to.

07:16.832 --> 07:19.100
Christopher, Sonja,
deep-dive Barrett.

07:19.102 --> 07:21.369
Get Patton to look into
his digital footprint, too.

07:21.371 --> 07:23.004
Find out what brought him here,

07:23.006 --> 07:24.838
go a long way in helping us
figure out

07:24.840 --> 07:26.773
who killed him and why.

07:32.214 --> 07:34.147
The rifle is
no ordinary rifle.

07:34.149 --> 07:37.750
It's a IM .50-caliber
tranquilizer gun.

07:37.752 --> 07:39.052
Tranquilizer?

07:39.054 --> 07:40.487
Yeah, it's usually used
to hunt big...

07:40.489 --> 07:42.955
Sorry. It's okay.

07:42.957 --> 07:45.224
Uh, it's usually used
to hunt big game.

07:45.226 --> 07:48.160
It's, uh, meant to knock a lion
out from distance in seconds.

07:48.162 --> 07:50.595
Of course, that-that doesn't
necessarily guarantee

07:50.597 --> 07:51.630
that you're not gonna get eaten.

07:51.632 --> 07:52.998
You know who
it's registered to?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.100
I do. Yeah.
It was registered to...

07:55.102 --> 07:57.102
Petty Officer Barrett.

07:57.871 --> 07:59.038
Huh.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.206
Middle of the night, Barrett

08:01.208 --> 08:02.973
goes to the arena...

08:02.975 --> 08:05.910
climbs to the rafters
with a tranq gun... Why?

08:05.912 --> 08:07.445
He's looking to
take somebody out

08:07.447 --> 08:08.779
from far away,
I guess.

08:08.781 --> 08:10.415
Killer?

08:10.417 --> 08:12.183
Or maybe somebody else.

08:12.185 --> 08:14.885
Oh, Agent Gregorio... Hello.

08:14.887 --> 08:16.820
Hi.
Is this a cartel case?

08:16.822 --> 08:18.856
- 'Cause I thought you were actually...
- No. It's actually...

08:18.858 --> 08:21.258
Oops. Sorry.
I just hit the wrong button.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.326
He's used to it.
Okay.

08:23.328 --> 08:24.461
What's this?

08:24.463 --> 08:26.496
So I just got off the phone
with NOPD.

08:26.498 --> 08:29.933
Arena security says two
of the emergency alarm exits

08:29.935 --> 08:32.001
were tripped right
after Barrett's TOD.

08:32.003 --> 08:35.205
One in the upper decks
and one on the court.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.206
Ten stories apart.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.807
No way the killer could have
set them both off.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.308
That means there had to be
somebody else.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.211
A third person on the court.

08:42.212 --> 08:44.113
Third person.

08:44.115 --> 08:45.914
Third person doing what?

08:45.916 --> 08:48.584
Well, if we had a
little more manpower,

08:48.586 --> 08:50.352
we'd be able to find out.

08:51.956 --> 08:54.355
FBI's right across town.

08:54.357 --> 08:57.792
Too many cooks
slows the investigation.

08:57.794 --> 09:01.096
We got everybody we need
right here in house.

09:01.098 --> 09:02.997
Okay.

09:02.999 --> 09:04.632
<i>Your sailor got an e-mail</i>
<i>last night</i>

09:04.634 --> 09:07.235
from someone I think wanted
to do him harm.

09:07.237 --> 09:09.404
"Barrett. You try going
through with this,

09:09.406 --> 09:11.871
and I promise you,
you will regret it."

09:11.873 --> 09:13.540
Them sound like
fighting words.

09:13.542 --> 09:15.275
Can you trace the ID
of the sender?

09:15.277 --> 09:17.111
It'll be faster
if you give me the Intel.

09:17.113 --> 09:19.079
I'll send it to FBI
Cyber Crimes to run it.

09:19.081 --> 09:20.647
Oh, I know you didn't just
say that.

09:20.649 --> 09:22.182
Triple P crack-a-hacks

09:22.184 --> 09:23.984
twice as fast
as your cyber agents.

09:23.986 --> 09:26.019
Watch and learn, newbie.

09:26.021 --> 09:28.287
All right.
Pulling up the header.

09:28.289 --> 09:32.125
Copying the routing information
and the IP address.

09:32.127 --> 09:33.826
And bam!

09:33.828 --> 09:35.161
Read 'em and weep.

09:35.163 --> 09:38.030
Hank Clarkson, 36 Forshey
Street, New Orleans.

09:38.032 --> 09:39.732
Retired Army Ranger.

09:39.734 --> 09:41.900
Had a string of run-ins with the
law after his service.

09:41.902 --> 09:44.569
Done time for armed robbery
and grand theft.

09:44.571 --> 09:46.904
So a trained killer
with a record

09:46.906 --> 09:49.374
sends a threat to our sailor
the night he's murdered.

09:49.376 --> 09:51.376
Sounds like probable cause
to me.

09:51.378 --> 09:53.645
Let's pick him up before
he hurts anybody else.

09:56.350 --> 09:57.982
You realize, of course,
what you just did there

09:57.984 --> 09:59.451
is illegal, right?

09:59.453 --> 10:02.052
Don't ask, don't tell.

10:06.959 --> 10:09.826
Don't call the police.

10:09.828 --> 10:12.630
I got the door.
Copy that.

10:15.868 --> 10:16.967
NCIS!

10:18.303 --> 10:19.802
Federal agents!
Freeze!

10:19.804 --> 10:22.038
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

10:22.040 --> 10:23.773
Don't move or I'll shoot!
Hey! No, no!

10:23.775 --> 10:25.007
Ma'am, ma'am, you need
to step away from him.

10:25.009 --> 10:26.442
Step away from him right now.
You don't understand.

10:26.444 --> 10:28.010
He's a suspect in a murder case.

10:28.012 --> 10:30.446
He is my husband.

10:30.448 --> 10:32.682
And we are just trying
to save our son!

10:47.257 --> 10:48.073
Put your hands behind your back.

10:48.097 --> 10:49.779
Hey. Please, look, it's
not what it looks like.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.913
Oh, no? It looks like
you were threatening your wife!

10:51.915 --> 10:53.448
He wasn't trying to hurt me!
He was trying

10:53.450 --> 10:54.816
to console me!

10:54.818 --> 10:57.152
Gregorio, I think
we should hear 'em out.

10:57.154 --> 10:59.188
It's FBI protocol to do this...
Not an FBI case.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.590
Sailor's NCIS,

11:01.592 --> 11:02.957
I'm in charge.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.793
Put your cuffs away.

11:09.499 --> 11:11.265
Our son, Drew.

11:11.267 --> 11:14.468
He's a petty officer
stationed out of San Diego.

11:14.470 --> 11:18.472
Three days ago, he went down
to Mexico for a little R & R.

11:18.474 --> 11:21.242
And that's the last
that we've heard from him.

11:21.244 --> 11:23.410
Until we got
the ransom demand.

11:23.412 --> 11:25.778
Hostage takers wanted
a million dollars to let him go.

11:25.780 --> 11:27.247
But we don't have
that kind of money.

11:27.249 --> 11:28.915
Did you report it
to the authorities?

11:28.917 --> 11:29.949
There are procedures
in place...

11:29.951 --> 11:32.085
Of course we reported it.

11:32.087 --> 11:34.487
The Navy did all
that they could. But then...

11:34.489 --> 11:36.989
the Feds and the State
Department got involved, saying

11:36.991 --> 11:40.093
that paying a ransom was against
policy or some crap like that.

11:40.095 --> 11:43.095
Unfortunately, it's the truth,
Mr. Clarkson. If the government

11:43.097 --> 11:44.496
paid
every ransom demand,

11:44.498 --> 11:46.765
we'd have more people
like your son taken hostage.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.800
So, what, they're just gonna
pretend like it didn't happen?

11:48.802 --> 11:50.001
They're gonna let Drew die?

11:50.003 --> 11:52.738
What if it was
your son, lady, hmm?

11:52.740 --> 11:55.140
Assume you didn't
let it go at that,

11:55.142 --> 11:57.542
tried to take matters
into your own hands?

11:57.544 --> 11:59.611
I got in touch
with a military contractor

11:59.613 --> 12:03.013
that had experience in Mexico,
Logan Black.

12:03.015 --> 12:06.517
I paid him so that he could
negotiate with the kidnappers,

12:06.519 --> 12:07.818
but they wouldn't budge.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.820
That's when
I called Collin.

12:09.822 --> 12:10.685
Petty Officer Barrett.

12:10.709 --> 12:13.035
We grew up together.
I asked him for help.

12:13.293 --> 12:15.992
He told us we should go through
with the kidnapper's plan

12:15.994 --> 12:17.661
and pretend we had the money.

12:17.663 --> 12:20.664
Thought if he could... catch
the contact at the drop,

12:20.666 --> 12:23.133
we might be able
to exchange him for our son.

12:23.135 --> 12:26.836
Contact got the jump on Barrett
instead, turned the tables.

12:26.838 --> 12:28.739
I knew it was risky.

12:28.741 --> 12:31.374
That's why I e-mailed him
and tried to scare him off.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.910
And if Collin would've listened,
he might still be alive.

12:34.912 --> 12:36.579
Whoa, wait.

12:36.581 --> 12:40.283
You were the other person
at the arena, on the court?

12:40.285 --> 12:43.452
She was just trying to get our
son back, any way that we could.

12:46.591 --> 12:49.891
When's the last time you heard
from the hostage takers?

12:54.364 --> 12:56.631
Don't follow orders,

12:56.633 --> 12:58.600
I'll be executed.

12:58.602 --> 13:00.635
Go to the police,

13:00.637 --> 13:02.604
I'll be executed.

13:03.473 --> 13:05.472
Don't pay the money,

13:05.474 --> 13:08.041
I'll be executed.

13:08.043 --> 13:10.778
This is your last chance
to save my life.

13:10.780 --> 13:13.914
8:00 p.m., answer the phone.

13:15.884 --> 13:18.185
Mom, Dad, don't do it! Don't
give these pricks anything!

13:20.189 --> 13:22.922
Whoa.

13:22.924 --> 13:26.793
Clarksons were sent this
video just this morning,

13:26.795 --> 13:28.294
so clock's ticking.

13:28.296 --> 13:31.698
We got less than five hours
to find him.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.734
Need to figure out
who took him first.

13:34.736 --> 13:37.169
Means we need to find
the only person

13:37.171 --> 13:40.071
who's had direct contact with
the hostage takers and fast.

13:40.073 --> 13:42.273
The Clarksons' negotiator,
Logan Black.

13:42.275 --> 13:44.209
Unfortunately, he's MIA.

13:44.211 --> 13:46.812
Sent NOPD to pick him up
for questioning like you said--

13:46.814 --> 13:48.213
he's nowhere to be found.

13:48.215 --> 13:49.781
We got a BOLO
out on him.

13:49.783 --> 13:52.684
Not good enough.
Running out of time to find him.

13:52.686 --> 13:55.086
Let's hope
Gregorio's doing better.

14:00.626 --> 14:03.227
Pulled a few favors from
my friends at State Department.

14:03.229 --> 14:05.929
Think I know where Drew Clarkson
was taken hostage.

14:05.931 --> 14:08.265
Cayucas Nightclub,

14:08.267 --> 14:11.402
Mazatlan. Apparently, he was
throwing around a lot of cash,

14:11.404 --> 14:13.536
even got a table
in the VIP lounge.

14:13.538 --> 14:16.373
So a 19-year-old,
fresh off the base,

14:16.375 --> 14:20.744
cash in his pocket, goes to
a club to let off some steam?

14:20.746 --> 14:23.212
Wanted to live like
a big shot for a night.

14:23.214 --> 14:24.881
There's no crime in that.

14:24.883 --> 14:27.517
No, but his spending made him
look like a high roller

14:27.519 --> 14:29.218
to H&E crews casing the place.

14:29.220 --> 14:30.886
Any idea which
crew took him?

14:30.888 --> 14:32.788
No, this is the first time
they set up a direct call

14:32.790 --> 14:36.024
to the Clarksons. FBI's
setting up a tap and trace.

14:36.026 --> 14:39.327
Should be able to locate
and identify who's behind this.

14:39.329 --> 14:41.463
Well, if a call came in over the
Internet, you can't trace that

14:41.465 --> 14:43.399
unless you get a warrant.
Warrant and tap it

14:43.401 --> 14:45.467
to the cable provider's
main terminal.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.302
Done and done.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.470
Not bad.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.239
All right. So we find out
where they're holding Drew

14:52.241 --> 14:54.609
and we go in there
and find him, right?

14:54.611 --> 14:57.478
In Mexico? I don't think so.
NCIS isn't sanctioned

14:57.480 --> 15:00.515
to carry out an
international rescue mission.

15:00.517 --> 15:02.149
Okay, then what
are we supposed to do?

15:02.151 --> 15:03.751
What NCIS is allowed to do,

15:03.753 --> 15:05.351
find the sailor's killer.

15:05.353 --> 15:07.654
He's probably
still stateside.

15:07.656 --> 15:11.190
Call might give us a lead. But
as for Drew, that's up to State.

15:12.494 --> 15:15.261
So you're saying
<i>they'll</i> rescue him.

15:15.263 --> 15:17.363
They'll determine a plan
that ensures the greatest good

15:17.365 --> 15:18.665
for the greatest number
of people.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.000
What is that?

15:21.002 --> 15:23.101
Is that something that comes
straight out of the damn

15:23.103 --> 15:25.370
FBI manual?
Don't you care about this kid?

15:25.372 --> 15:27.339
Of course I care about him.
Who wouldn't?

15:27.341 --> 15:30.676
But I know better than to let
my emotions dictate my job.

15:30.678 --> 15:32.678
Otherwise I wouldn't
be able to do my job.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.880
Yeah, well, that's not how
we do things down here.

15:34.882 --> 15:37.316
All right, when they find
the kid, we go down there

15:37.318 --> 15:40.217
and rescue him. You got it?
Ain't that right, King?

15:41.287 --> 15:42.720
We're gonna take this

15:42.722 --> 15:44.956
one step at a time, Christopher.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.359
Gregorio's
right.

15:48.361 --> 15:50.562
For now, we're only sanctioned

15:50.564 --> 15:52.597
to find Barrett's killer.

15:52.599 --> 15:53.698
Let's
just see

15:53.700 --> 15:56.299
how it all plays out.

15:56.301 --> 15:57.768
NOPD just found

15:57.770 --> 15:59.703
our negotiator,
Logan Black,

15:59.705 --> 16:01.905
hanging from a streetlight
in Central City.

16:01.907 --> 16:04.741
His body is landing
on Wade's table as we speak.

16:04.743 --> 16:08.211
At least you know
your killer's still stateside.

16:08.213 --> 16:10.380
Go. See if Loretta
gets any clues off the body

16:10.382 --> 16:11.715
that'll help us find the killer.

16:11.717 --> 16:15.718
Then meet us at FBI
HQ for the call.

16:18.957 --> 16:22.157
<i>It's not that I don't trust</i>
<i>Pride. You know I do.</i>

16:22.159 --> 16:24.226
But if we start letting
FBI call the shots,

16:24.228 --> 16:26.161
next thing you know,
it's gonna be their letters

16:26.163 --> 16:27.864
hanging outside our squad room.

16:27.866 --> 16:30.699
Uh, the FBI is expediting
the tap and trace.

16:30.701 --> 16:32.634
We should be grateful,
especially if we don't get

16:32.636 --> 16:34.703
any leads here.
Yeah, still, if we find the kid,

16:34.705 --> 16:36.304
he'll give us
all the leads we need

16:36.306 --> 16:38.072
into finding
Barrett's killer, too.

16:38.074 --> 16:39.841
Yeah, but Gregorio's right.

16:39.843 --> 16:43.311
Rescuing Drew is up to State,
not us.

16:43.313 --> 16:45.146
The problem is,
if we leave it up to State,

16:45.148 --> 16:46.647
by the time they're finished
passing memos

16:46.649 --> 16:49.984
and approvals around,
the kid might be dead.

16:50.853 --> 16:52.720
Whoa!

16:52.722 --> 16:54.555
Not a pretty sight.

16:54.557 --> 16:57.190
Judging from
the multiple compound fractures,

16:57.192 --> 17:00.327
blunt force trauma,
petechial hemorrhaging,

17:00.329 --> 17:02.663
lacerations,
it's safe to say

17:02.665 --> 17:05.632
this poor man was tortured
before they killed him.

17:05.634 --> 17:06.952
Cut out his tongue
for good measure.

17:08.169 --> 17:11.570
MS-13, Norteños.
Cutting out

17:11.573 --> 17:14.540
the tongue is a trademark of
all major South American crews.

17:14.542 --> 17:17.276
Meant to warn people:
you rat, you die.

17:17.278 --> 17:20.378
Well, they must've known
we were looking for Clarkson's negotiator.

17:20.381 --> 17:22.013
Hung his body
on that streetlight

17:22.016 --> 17:24.683
to scare anyone else
from telling us who they are.

17:24.685 --> 17:27.152
Were you or Sebastian able
to get anything off the body

17:27.154 --> 17:29.655
to help us I.D. the killer?
He cleaned up after himself,

17:29.657 --> 17:31.823
he wiped down the corpse.
Sebastian's trying

17:31.825 --> 17:34.125
to pull prints,
but it'll take time.

17:34.127 --> 17:35.994
That's time we don't have.

17:35.996 --> 17:37.728
Call's in 30 minutes.

17:37.730 --> 17:40.197
Which means we'd better hope
FBI gets us some leads,

17:40.199 --> 17:43.200
'cause we just struck out.

17:43.202 --> 17:45.102
<i>Patch me</i>
<i>into the Clarksons' home.</i>

17:45.104 --> 17:47.638
<i>Okay, everyone, be ready.</i>

17:47.640 --> 17:51.108
Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson,
one minute until call.

17:51.110 --> 17:53.678
What-what if they catch on?

17:53.680 --> 17:55.478
Just take deep breaths,
stick to the script.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.981
You do that,
you'll be fine.

17:59.217 --> 18:01.150
All right, look,

18:01.152 --> 18:05.254
if FBI can pinpoint the location
of our hostage takers,

18:05.256 --> 18:06.823
tell us who we're dealing with,

18:06.825 --> 18:09.006
should help us I.D.
the stateside killer.

18:09.007 --> 18:11.860
Still, I'm worried
about the kid, King.

18:11.862 --> 18:13.062
So am I, Chris.

18:13.064 --> 18:14.463
Direct connection.

18:14.465 --> 18:16.398
Incoming call to
the Clarksons' IP.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.634
Okay, here we go. Remember,
I need him on the phone

18:18.636 --> 18:20.636
for one minute
to get the trace.

18:20.638 --> 18:22.871
Whenever you're ready.

18:22.873 --> 18:25.841
Do you have the ransom?

18:25.843 --> 18:28.077
Yes. We do.

18:28.079 --> 18:30.078
Then listen carefully.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.313
I will say this only once.

18:32.315 --> 18:35.249
Agent Gregorio, we are
locked on. Commencing trace now.

18:35.251 --> 18:37.118
One half hour, Jackson Square.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.353
Come alone,
or we will kill your son.

18:39.355 --> 18:42.657
No more games,
do you understand?

18:42.659 --> 18:43.925
The script, Susan.

18:43.927 --> 18:45.659
Read it now.

18:45.661 --> 18:49.029
We want to speak
to Drew first.

18:49.031 --> 18:50.196
No.

18:50.198 --> 18:52.032
Please, we just need

18:52.034 --> 18:53.734
to know that he's alive.
He is.

18:53.736 --> 18:55.902
Need another 30 seconds.
You will have to take my word.

18:55.904 --> 18:58.538
Listen to me, Susan,
I know you're scared,

18:58.540 --> 19:00.741
but you got to try and keep him
on the line, all right?

19:00.743 --> 19:02.275
Try again.

19:02.277 --> 19:04.209
Please, I'm his mother,

19:04.211 --> 19:06.578
and I-I need to hear him.

19:06.580 --> 19:09.381
Otherwise, no deal.

19:13.621 --> 19:15.320
Very well.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.196
Say something.
Go to hell!

19:25.198 --> 19:26.998
Drew!
Mom, Mom!

19:27.000 --> 19:28.066
Baby, are you all right?

19:32.438 --> 19:34.039
I said

19:34.041 --> 19:35.606
no more games!
No, no!

19:35.608 --> 19:36.574
Wait, wait!

19:36.576 --> 19:37.975
Susan, tell him he's wrong.

19:37.977 --> 19:38.909
Drew!
Wait!

19:38.911 --> 19:40.144
Dad, Dad, Dad!

19:44.684 --> 19:46.150
Oh, my God.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.986
Oh, no! No!

19:48.988 --> 19:52.455
Oh, my God.

20:07.212 --> 20:10.447
Hey. Anything?

20:10.449 --> 20:13.583
Keep trying to find something
FBI got from this call,

20:13.585 --> 20:15.952
but... it's a whole lot
of nothing.

20:15.954 --> 20:19.389
No location,
no kidnapper identity.

20:19.391 --> 20:22.325
Just another dead sailor
and a devastated family.

20:22.327 --> 20:24.025
Well, where's everybody else?

20:24.027 --> 20:26.562
Well, Pride's with Patton,
and Gregorio,

20:26.564 --> 20:28.263
she hasn't shown up yet.

20:28.265 --> 20:31.367
Ooh. Can you blame her?

20:31.369 --> 20:33.869
Well, as a matter of fact,
yeah, I can.

20:33.871 --> 20:35.838
Christopher.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.707
Look, I know she meant
well and everything,

20:38.709 --> 20:41.576
but thanks to her and the FBI,

20:41.578 --> 20:44.144
things went bust in a big way.

20:44.146 --> 20:46.313
And if we would've got
to do it our way...

20:46.315 --> 20:48.249
Nothing would've changed.

20:48.251 --> 20:52.253
We had less than they had.
We didn't even have a lead.

20:52.255 --> 20:55.857
The FBI was
our only option.

20:55.859 --> 20:57.758
And Drew's.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.559
We just...

20:59.561 --> 21:02.629
we just got into
this whole thing too late.

21:02.631 --> 21:05.832
And as much as I hate to say it,

21:05.834 --> 21:08.435
so did Gregorio.

21:10.372 --> 21:12.939
In here.

21:17.278 --> 21:19.545
- No more games.
- No, no! Wait, wait!

21:19.547 --> 21:21.079
Susan, tell him he's wrong.

21:21.081 --> 21:22.681
Wasn't listening to it once
bad enough?

21:24.184 --> 21:26.251
Moment of impact,
when the bullet hit Drew...

21:26.253 --> 21:28.687
or so the kidnappers
wanted us to think.

21:28.689 --> 21:31.623
I ran it through an exclusive
piece of Triple P software,

21:31.625 --> 21:34.025
analyzing the impact's
sine wave,

21:34.027 --> 21:37.128
amplitude and frequency
to try to find an acoustic match

21:37.130 --> 21:38.596
in my sound library.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.764
Like an audio fingerprint.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.132
Bingo.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.934
And the results:

21:44.203 --> 21:46.237
The bullet didn't hit flesh.

21:46.239 --> 21:48.205
It hit a brick wall.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.574
Meaning what?
Meaning

21:50.576 --> 21:53.777
Drew Clarkson could still
very well be alive.

21:53.779 --> 21:56.480
I was up all night thinking,
remembered how H&E crews

21:56.482 --> 21:59.316
typically find other ways
to profit from a hostage,

21:59.318 --> 22:01.852
even after the ransom
demand fails.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.019
Profit how?

22:03.021 --> 22:04.254
Prisoner exchange.
Mm-hmm.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.922
Drug mule.
Organ donor.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.690
Yes, but...

22:07.692 --> 22:11.193
assuming that Patton's right
about the bullet, okay,

22:11.195 --> 22:13.596
and Drew's still alive,

22:13.598 --> 22:15.130
we know that they won't

22:15.132 --> 22:16.899
keep him in the same
place for long.

22:16.901 --> 22:18.734
Still, without a location
and no way

22:18.736 --> 22:20.603
of contacting
the hostage takers,

22:20.605 --> 22:23.805
finding Drew's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

22:23.807 --> 22:25.707
And without knowing
who took Drew,

22:25.709 --> 22:27.909
we can't figure out who killed
Petty Officer Barrett.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.377
Well, maybe we flip it--

22:29.379 --> 22:31.012
find Barrett's killer,
and use that

22:31.014 --> 22:33.849
to find out who took Drew.

22:33.851 --> 22:36.852
Sebastian...

22:36.854 --> 22:39.220
Ah. He thinks he
might've found a way

22:39.222 --> 22:41.455
to get a fingerprint
off the negotiator's body.

22:41.457 --> 22:42.756
That could get us to the killer.

22:42.758 --> 22:45.125
Which also may help us
rescue Drew.

22:46.195 --> 22:47.461
Yeah, all right, look,

22:47.463 --> 22:49.663
Patton, keep listening,
all right?

22:49.665 --> 22:51.799
See if you can hear anything
else that'll help us

22:51.801 --> 22:53.701
find him.
Hey, where you going?

22:53.703 --> 22:55.903
Let someone off the hook.

23:02.477 --> 23:05.011
Doesn't get
much better than this.

23:05.013 --> 23:08.180
Picked a great place
to stay, Gregorio.

23:08.182 --> 23:10.182
Quarter'll win you over
if you're not careful.

23:10.184 --> 23:12.585
Spare me the
folksy charm.

23:12.587 --> 23:15.754
I don't belong here, Pride.
You know that as well as I do.

23:15.756 --> 23:17.255
Last night
proves that.

23:17.257 --> 23:19.090
Last night
had nothing to do with you.

23:24.064 --> 23:26.097
I don't know.

23:26.099 --> 23:27.666
I was trained

23:27.668 --> 23:30.402
to profile ISIS rebels,

23:30.404 --> 23:32.269
Hezbollah, Boko Haram--

23:32.271 --> 23:34.605
bad guys I don't mind
seen taken out.

23:34.607 --> 23:38.242
But getting to know the victims
and their families?

23:38.244 --> 23:40.310
That's not something
I'm used to.

23:40.312 --> 23:43.881
Maybe not up in DC, but,
uh, down here, that's just...

23:43.883 --> 23:46.450
part of the way we do things.
Yeah, well, it's bad policy.

23:46.452 --> 23:48.117
Emotions cloud judgment,
get in the way.

23:48.119 --> 23:49.920
I mean, look at me,
I'm a wreck.

23:49.922 --> 23:51.988
Just means you care, is all.

23:51.990 --> 23:54.123
How's that bad?

23:55.226 --> 23:56.860
Can't connect
with the victims,

23:56.862 --> 23:58.728
can't connect with yourself,
that's worse.

24:00.365 --> 24:02.699
You get that out of
a Nola fortune cookie?

24:02.701 --> 24:04.167
Yes, I did.

24:07.638 --> 24:10.105
Could still use your help...

24:10.107 --> 24:12.307
finding Drew.

24:13.644 --> 24:15.477
No offense, but, uh...

24:15.479 --> 24:17.613
we didn't trust the FBI
with the final word,

24:17.615 --> 24:20.382
so we ran our own analysis,
pretty sure he's still alive.

24:20.384 --> 24:22.283
What?
Yeah.

24:22.285 --> 24:25.086
Let's work together,
Gregorio, we can do this.

24:26.222 --> 24:28.556
If I get you Barrett's killer,

24:28.558 --> 24:30.424
you think you could
get your fancy suits

24:30.426 --> 24:33.494
to ID the crew
that kidnapped Drew?

24:41.870 --> 24:43.136
Hi.

24:43.138 --> 24:47.140
Uh, see, relative humidity
of at least 75% is ideal

24:47.142 --> 24:49.275
for activating
fingerprint residue.

24:49.277 --> 24:52.045
Which means once the killer's
prints rise to the surface,

24:52.047 --> 24:55.715
all I need to do is capture them
with my trusty vapor glue wand

24:55.717 --> 24:58.884
and I dust 'em
with some contrast powder,

24:58.886 --> 25:00.252
and...

25:00.254 --> 25:02.321
boom.

25:02.323 --> 25:06.225
All right.
You got yourself a finger...

25:06.227 --> 25:09.028
Man, I can't see.
Someone take...

25:09.030 --> 25:10.596
Who is that?

25:10.598 --> 25:11.998
It's me.
Okay.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.465
You think it's enough
to ID our killer?

25:14.467 --> 25:17.068
Well, it's only a partial,
but it should be enough

25:17.070 --> 25:19.270
to narrow down
who we're looking for, at least.

25:22.542 --> 25:24.408
That's more matches
than I would've hoped for.

25:24.410 --> 25:26.044
24 potential suspects.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.545
Yeah, clock's ticking,
we don't have time

25:27.547 --> 25:29.880
to go around questioning
a couple of dozen suspects.

25:29.882 --> 25:31.348
Need to narrow it down.

25:31.350 --> 25:32.783
Wait, wait, wait.

25:32.785 --> 25:35.218
Cross-check it
with arena employees.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.021
That might explain
how the killer was able

25:37.023 --> 25:40.057
to bypass security cams
before he killed Barrett.

25:40.993 --> 25:42.459
I'm on it.

25:44.130 --> 25:47.030
Diego Martinez,
former employee of ShieldNet,

25:47.032 --> 25:49.498
a private security company
that worked the arena.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.333
Yeah, former
Mexican special forces.

25:51.335 --> 25:54.170
Been using his skills
to do more harm than good.

25:54.172 --> 25:55.905
The guy's got a serious record.

25:55.907 --> 25:57.807
Notify the Marshals Service?

25:57.809 --> 26:00.777
We did, but we were too late.
Martinez cleared customs

26:00.779 --> 26:03.646
at Mazatlán International
Airport two hours ago.

26:03.648 --> 26:06.548
Which means not only have
we lost our best chance

26:06.550 --> 26:08.650
at Barrett's killer,
we've also

26:08.652 --> 26:10.218
lost our chance
at finding Drew.

26:10.220 --> 26:13.088
I might be able to help.
Pulled a few strings

26:13.090 --> 26:15.190
when Martinez's name
came across the wire,

26:15.192 --> 26:17.893
got actionable Intel on
where he might be in Mazatlán.

26:17.895 --> 26:20.028
Good work, Gregorio.
Talk to me.

26:20.030 --> 26:22.196
You have to understand,
I'm pretty sure Director Isler's

26:22.198 --> 26:25.399
only going to approve
of us going after Martinez.

26:25.401 --> 26:27.267
Yeah, but what about Drew?

26:27.269 --> 26:29.336
He won't authorize that.
Neither will State.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.472
You are not allowed
to rescue the hostage.

26:36.378 --> 26:38.444
I'm sorry.

26:51.629 --> 26:53.729
No, I'm clear about
how you obtained Intel

26:53.781 --> 26:55.246
on Barrett's killer,
what I'm not clear about

26:55.248 --> 26:56.648
is who gave you permission

26:56.650 --> 26:58.550
to reach out
to International Ops to get it?

26:58.552 --> 27:00.251
Agent Gregorio
was assisting us...

27:00.253 --> 27:01.653
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to her.

27:01.655 --> 27:03.455
Sir, you assigned me
to help NCIS,

27:03.457 --> 27:05.089
and that's all I
was trying to do.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.358
Martinez fled the country

27:06.360 --> 27:08.526
before Pride and his
team could grab him.

27:08.528 --> 27:10.895
Time was of the essence.
<i>Is</i> of the essence.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.564
All right.
Show me what you got.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.701
Diego Martinez
goes by several aliases,

27:17.703 --> 27:20.937
one of which the DEA UC spotted
heading into a remote,

27:20.939 --> 27:23.640
heavily guarded village
on the outskirts of Mazatlán.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.744
Happens to be where
the El Cautivo Crew hides out,

27:26.746 --> 27:28.745
and we know he's
a high-ranking member.

27:28.747 --> 27:30.713
Did you want to tell me
that El Cautivo

27:30.715 --> 27:32.548
are also believed
to be responsible

27:32.550 --> 27:34.684
for taking Drew Clarkson
hostage?

27:34.686 --> 27:38.187
And that these two cases might
be-- probably are-- connected?

27:38.189 --> 27:40.289
I read your report.
Sir, if you're insinuating that...

27:40.291 --> 27:41.624
I'm not insinuating
anything.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.459
I just want
to understand exactly

27:43.461 --> 27:45.894
what you and Agent Pride
are asking me to do here.

27:45.896 --> 27:48.263
We're only asking you
to get DOJ to request

27:48.265 --> 27:50.432
a provincial arrest warrant

27:50.434 --> 27:53.502
from the Mexican attorney
general for Diego Martinez.

27:53.504 --> 27:55.069
And clearance
from the state department for us

27:55.071 --> 27:56.772
to go down there
to make the arrest.

27:56.774 --> 27:58.039
What about
the hostage,

27:58.041 --> 27:59.408
Clarkson?

27:59.410 --> 28:01.910
I've briefed
Agent Pride on our

28:01.912 --> 28:04.211
relevant protocol, and
he's assured me that

28:04.213 --> 28:06.046
Martinez is his only interest.

28:06.048 --> 28:08.716
Good, then we're clear.

28:08.718 --> 28:11.218
Just curious, though--
what is the protocol

28:11.220 --> 28:13.220
if we happen to get Intel
on where they're

28:13.222 --> 28:14.622
holding Clarkson
while we're down there?

28:14.624 --> 28:16.490
You hand that Intel
over to State

28:16.492 --> 28:18.158
and let them handle it.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.959
What if we find out the boy
won't last long enough

28:19.961 --> 28:21.928
for State to handle it?
Agent Pride,

28:21.930 --> 28:23.797
Mexico is our ally.

28:23.799 --> 28:25.398
And we have strict
rules of engagement

28:25.400 --> 28:26.966
with their government,
ones which we cannot

28:26.968 --> 28:28.701
vary from, do you understand?
Mm-hmm.

28:28.703 --> 28:31.003
You cannot and will not
break protocol

28:31.005 --> 28:32.772
for any reason,
otherwise you and your team

28:32.774 --> 28:34.340
will face
criminal charges.

28:34.342 --> 28:36.008
This is not a rescue mission.

28:36.010 --> 28:37.543
Are we clear?

28:38.612 --> 28:40.412
Crystal.

28:42.282 --> 28:44.316
Gregorio will take lead,

28:44.318 --> 28:46.051
coordinate with the <i>federales.</i>

28:46.053 --> 28:47.419
Good luck.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.720
Thank you.

28:48.722 --> 28:51.790
Gregorio, a word.

28:53.927 --> 28:55.827
I need you
to keep an eye on him.

28:55.829 --> 28:58.195
Why? He's no longer under review.
You know what I mean,

28:58.197 --> 29:00.598
and you know how he operates.

29:02.602 --> 29:05.402
Don't get caught up in his ways,
Tammy, I'm warning you.

29:05.404 --> 29:07.171
'Cause if he
crosses the line,

29:07.173 --> 29:09.106
it'll be your shield, too.

29:09.108 --> 29:10.640
Do you understand?

29:11.710 --> 29:13.242
Yes, sir.

29:18.183 --> 29:20.316
Call the referent agent
in Mazatlán,

29:20.318 --> 29:21.618
tell him we're on our way.

29:21.620 --> 29:22.919
We're good to go?

29:22.921 --> 29:24.454
To get Barrett's
killer, yes.

29:24.456 --> 29:25.789
But what about Drew?

29:25.791 --> 29:27.890
We're only authorized

29:27.892 --> 29:29.592
to bring Martinez back.

29:29.594 --> 29:31.527
Let's gear up.
Flight leaves in an hour,

29:31.529 --> 29:33.061
with or without us.
Pride,

29:33.063 --> 29:36.532
um... Mrs. Clarkson's here.

29:36.534 --> 29:37.733
Now, we didn't know

29:37.735 --> 29:39.034
what to say, so

29:39.036 --> 29:40.569
she's in the courtyard.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.585
Mrs. Clarkson.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.955
Agent Pride.

30:00.957 --> 30:04.024
I'm sorry to drop in
all unexpected like this.

30:04.026 --> 30:07.227
No-no need to apologize.
I-I don't know if you got my...

30:07.229 --> 30:09.329
He was our only child.

30:11.066 --> 30:14.668
I still can't believe he's gone.

30:15.971 --> 30:17.337
I just...

30:17.339 --> 30:21.340
I want you to know
that Hank and I know

30:21.342 --> 30:23.042
you did everything you could

30:23.044 --> 30:25.912
to try and
bring Drew back.

30:25.914 --> 30:29.782
We don't blame you
for what happened.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.183
Mrs. Clarkson...

30:31.185 --> 30:33.853
No, I mean it.
This is not

30:33.855 --> 30:35.220
your cross to bear.

30:35.222 --> 30:37.923
There was nothing
more you could do.

30:37.925 --> 30:39.891
Just promise me this:

30:39.893 --> 30:42.393
that you will do
everything you can

30:42.395 --> 30:45.864
to find who did this
and bring them to justice...

30:45.866 --> 30:49.834
so they can't hurt anybody else.

30:56.275 --> 30:59.342
I promise you
I'm gonna do more than that,

30:59.344 --> 31:01.579
Mrs. Clarkson.

31:02.882 --> 31:06.116
I can't give you
any of the details...

31:06.118 --> 31:09.519
but we believe your boy
is still alive.

31:10.622 --> 31:13.422
What? Wha...

31:13.424 --> 31:16.192
My team and I--

31:16.194 --> 31:18.327
we're gonna do
everything we can

31:18.329 --> 31:20.597
to bring him home to you,

31:20.599 --> 31:22.832
safe.
Oh...

31:22.834 --> 31:25.101
Oh.

31:42.597 --> 31:44.164
<i>Entraremos por el norte.</i>

31:44.166 --> 31:46.299
<i>Capturen a Martinez--</i>
<i>lo quiero vivo.</i>

31:46.301 --> 31:48.301
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

31:48.303 --> 31:50.403
Me no comprende.

31:50.405 --> 31:51.737
No?

31:51.739 --> 31:53.306
Well, that was
some good Spanish,

31:53.308 --> 31:55.107
but you're gonna have
to <i>habla inglés</i> the plan

31:55.109 --> 31:56.708
so I can understand it, too.
All right.

31:56.710 --> 31:59.111
What about Pride and Percy?
They need to know this, too.

31:59.113 --> 32:01.880
Oh, they're just
gearing up over there. Go ahead.

32:04.584 --> 32:06.651
Looks like
they're ready to roll.

32:07.921 --> 32:10.322
Come on, Patton.
Running out of time here.

32:10.324 --> 32:12.590
You got to narrow
it down for me.

32:12.592 --> 32:16.061
See a church nearby,
or better yet, a church bell?

32:16.863 --> 32:18.896
Uh, yup, see a church tower,

32:18.898 --> 32:20.764
about 300 yards away
from the compound.

32:20.766 --> 32:25.469
Any music? A lot of acoustics,
maybe a guitar or something?

32:25.471 --> 32:28.205
Street musicians

32:28.207 --> 32:30.607
- across from the church.
- Then, nearby

32:30.609 --> 32:32.909
is where the shots was fired,
which means Drew is close.

32:32.911 --> 32:35.012
Good work, Patton.

32:35.014 --> 32:37.246
Stand by.
Hey. She's coming.

32:37.248 --> 32:38.747
What are you gonna tell her?

32:38.749 --> 32:40.683
Tell her the truth.

32:40.685 --> 32:43.019
You and Percy will ride
with assault team 2,

32:43.021 --> 32:44.887
Lasalle and I'll take the lead
in the convoy.

32:44.889 --> 32:46.956
You got enough manpower
for Martinez.

32:46.958 --> 32:48.691
We think we've found Drew.

32:48.693 --> 32:50.426
We're gonna go after him.

32:50.428 --> 32:52.362
The hell you are. You're
under my orders down here.

32:52.364 --> 32:54.829
Well, it looks like
I'm gonna be disobeying them.

32:54.831 --> 32:56.598
What?
You better hurry.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.133
You don't want
to lose Martinez.

32:58.135 --> 32:59.701
What are you talking about?
We're here for you.

32:59.703 --> 33:01.769
Martinez is an NCIS target,
remember?

33:01.771 --> 33:03.305
Isler will bury us both.

33:03.307 --> 33:05.307
Then you tell him
I didn't give you any choice.

33:05.309 --> 33:07.175
Blame me for everything.
I don't care.

33:07.177 --> 33:11.212
Right now, I'm gonna do the
right thing, go rescue that kid.

33:11.214 --> 33:13.981
Pride!

33:37.605 --> 33:38.771
All right, so if we get the kid,

33:38.773 --> 33:40.206
and Tammy throws us
under the bus,

33:40.208 --> 33:41.641
by this time tomorrow,

33:41.643 --> 33:42.975
we'll be updating our résumés

33:42.977 --> 33:44.577
instead of filing
a case report.

33:44.579 --> 33:46.178
It's possible.

33:46.180 --> 33:48.447
And if you want to sit
this one out, I'd respect that.

33:48.449 --> 33:50.715
You're a good
agent, Sonja.

33:50.717 --> 33:52.151
You do what's right for you.

33:52.153 --> 33:54.053
This <i>is</i> what's right.

34:05.265 --> 34:06.764
That's got to be it.

34:06.766 --> 34:08.831
Upside down flag usually
means a stash house.

34:08.833 --> 34:11.302
I used to see it all the time
working with ATF.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.208
All right, look.

34:17.210 --> 34:18.775
You go in the front.

34:18.777 --> 34:20.143
If anybody's inside,
you keep 'em occupied.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.379
I'll go around back,
see if I can find him.

34:32.324 --> 34:34.623
<i>Hola.</i>

34:34.626 --> 34:38.226
Um... <i>yo soy Sonja.</i>

34:40.630 --> 34:45.634
I got separated
from my, uh, group.

34:45.636 --> 34:49.405
Um, so what I need is a...

34:49.407 --> 34:51.540
El mapo.

34:51.542 --> 34:53.507
We don't have no maps.

35:13.829 --> 35:16.196
Nice try, hombre.

35:26.475 --> 35:28.707
Pride, are you okay?
Do you need backup?

35:48.195 --> 35:49.961
Drew?

35:51.064 --> 35:54.266
Hey. Hey.
I'm Agent Pride.

35:54.268 --> 35:57.802
NCIS. I'm here
to take you home.

35:57.804 --> 35:59.671
Sonja, got him.

35:59.673 --> 36:01.572
How are things out front?
We're coming out.

36:01.574 --> 36:03.207
A lot of gunfire.

36:03.209 --> 36:05.108
Expect some company real soon.

36:07.146 --> 36:08.712
Can you walk?

36:11.984 --> 36:14.285
You knew they were gonna do
this, didn't you?

36:14.287 --> 36:17.288
We're a team.
Don't ever forget that.

36:17.290 --> 36:19.021
King, we got Martinez
in custody.

36:19.023 --> 36:20.209
Headed to you.
How's it looking?

36:20.233 --> 36:21.758
Well, we got Drew in hand.

36:21.759 --> 36:23.759
We're at the back of the store.
What's your ETA?

36:23.761 --> 36:25.027
One minute.

36:25.029 --> 36:27.096
We don't have one minute.

36:37.541 --> 36:39.774
You're late.
You're welcome.

36:40.411 --> 36:42.244
In here.

36:43.714 --> 36:45.146
Drive!

37:11.039 --> 37:13.707
Just got off the phone
with the State Department.

37:13.709 --> 37:18.578
They wanted to congratulate
us on a job well done.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.714
For the successful apprehension

37:20.716 --> 37:23.983
of an international fugitive,
and

37:23.985 --> 37:26.785
for rescuing a hostage
without incident.

37:26.787 --> 37:29.821
That's great.
Mm.

37:30.858 --> 37:33.125
However, since the state

37:33.127 --> 37:35.093
never authorized
the rescue,

37:35.095 --> 37:38.364
and because the
press is curious,

37:38.366 --> 37:41.400
they ask me, how'd you do it?

37:42.903 --> 37:44.669
It's a good question,
don't you think?

37:45.739 --> 37:47.505
What did you tell them?

37:47.507 --> 37:50.808
I told them
I'd have to get back to them...

37:50.810 --> 37:53.645
after I talk to my lead agent.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.882
Got more details.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.484
They're gonna want to know

38:00.486 --> 38:02.519
that we didn't violate
international protocol

38:02.521 --> 38:04.120
to pull this off,

38:04.122 --> 38:06.156
and I'm telling you...

38:06.158 --> 38:09.693
you better not have violated
protocol to pull this off.

38:13.231 --> 38:15.666
So...

38:15.668 --> 38:17.533
Okay.

38:21.238 --> 38:24.006
Agent Gregorio,

38:24.008 --> 38:27.209
walk me through the apprehension
of Diego Martinez

38:27.211 --> 38:30.212
and the rescue of Drew Clarkson

38:30.214 --> 38:32.548
from the top, please.

38:51.467 --> 38:53.900
What do you think
she's gonna do?

38:53.902 --> 38:55.135
Who?

38:55.137 --> 38:57.904
Shut up. You know who.

38:57.906 --> 39:01.542
Well, whatever Gregorio
does or doesn't do

39:01.544 --> 39:04.911
doesn't change what we did,
and I stand by it.

39:04.913 --> 39:07.481
Look, you got

39:07.483 --> 39:09.048
two choices in life.

39:09.050 --> 39:10.817
You either do the right thing,
or you don't.

39:10.819 --> 39:12.352
Simple as that.

39:12.354 --> 39:15.888
And I learned that
from that man.

39:15.890 --> 39:19.359
Straightened things out for me,
made decisions more clear.

39:20.729 --> 39:23.195
Never doubted you
for a second, King.

39:23.197 --> 39:25.331
Uh-huh.

39:26.266 --> 39:28.132
What do you think
she's gonna do?

39:28.134 --> 39:30.702
I hope the right thing.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.419
What's up?

39:48.421 --> 39:50.087
What's up? You kidding me?

39:50.089 --> 39:51.955
How screwed are we?

39:52.958 --> 39:55.292
As far as I know, not at all.

39:55.294 --> 39:56.560
I told Director Isler

39:56.562 --> 39:58.863
what I saw.
While Lasalle

39:58.865 --> 40:00.196
and I were getting Martinez,

40:00.198 --> 40:01.931
you and Pride were under attack,

40:01.933 --> 40:05.468
fought back and, uh, stumbled
across the hostage.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.738
<i>Stumbled</i> across?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.673
Like I said, I wasn't there.

40:10.675 --> 40:12.341
You thought the hostage
was in harm's way,

40:12.343 --> 40:14.010
and you did what you had to do.

40:14.012 --> 40:18.947
<i>Federales</i> seemed all right with
it, so who was I to complain?

40:18.949 --> 40:20.649
And Isler bought that?

40:20.651 --> 40:23.218
Give or take.

40:23.220 --> 40:26.388
Didn't hurt that we made him
look like a hero to State.

40:32.996 --> 40:35.430
Cream, right?

40:35.432 --> 40:37.565
Please.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.740
So you covered for us.

40:45.742 --> 40:49.577
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:11.365 --> 41:13.666
What are we doing here?

41:13.668 --> 41:16.969
Just thought you might like
to see why we do what we do.

41:16.971 --> 41:21.474
Not just about protocol,
or catching bad guys.

41:21.476 --> 41:23.308
Am I about to get another speech

41:23.310 --> 41:26.077
about how it's a good thing
to get to know the victims?

41:26.079 --> 41:29.046
Maybe.
So, what?

41:29.048 --> 41:31.583
The end justifies the means,
is that what you're saying?

41:31.585 --> 41:34.118
Depends on the
means, and the ends.

41:38.625 --> 41:40.558
Why're you showing me this,
Pride?

41:40.560 --> 41:43.093
What does it matter to you?

41:43.095 --> 41:45.395
It matters because

41:45.397 --> 41:48.999
it's one thing to review us
at arm's distance, DC style,

41:49.001 --> 41:53.537
but you're gonna be
working with us for a while,

41:53.539 --> 41:56.807
it's important
you see who we really are.

41:57.977 --> 42:01.477
What it's really all about.
