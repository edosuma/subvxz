00:10.611 --> 00:13.245
He was just the
kindest man you could ever meet.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.515
He brought me home
flowers every Friday.

00:39.389 --> 00:41.606
Even after he got sick,
he'd have them delivered.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.175
Sweet Jesus.

00:51.652 --> 00:55.220
Just a ray of sunshine,
he brightened every life he touched,

00:55.222 --> 00:56.288
not just mine,

00:57.358 --> 00:58.724
not just Hannah's.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.397
He had one of those smiles you
couldn't help but smile back at.

- What's wrong?
- I um...

01:20.181 --> 01:22.147
It's... it's grandpa's funeral.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.185
Of course.
It's hard on all of us.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.753
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.689
Oh, thank you, honey. I'm
sorry you got dragged here.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.858
I don't mind, really.

01:32.860 --> 01:36.562
We always love having you
around in good times or bad.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.084
I'm glad you're here, Maggie.

01:42.085 --> 01:43.735
Your father would be happy
you made it... eventually.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.604
Well, he didn't know I was late.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.674
Oh.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.379
Hey!

01:57.184 --> 01:58.317
Hi.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.752
So, my condolences
for your loss.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.822
Thanks. You too.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.358
So, how long do you think
you'll be in town for?

02:06.360 --> 02:09.627
Oh, well, I don't know,
maybe for a little while.

02:09.630 --> 02:14.233
It'll be nice to be closer to Michael and...
well, you guys too.

02:14.235 --> 02:18.837
It would be really great to have you
around more. Wouldn't it, Hannah?

02:18.839 --> 02:19.805
Sure.

02:19.807 --> 02:26.512
Well, if you are around long enough, you should
stop by one of my bowling team's matches.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.481
I'm always telling Hannah how she
should check out the fulfillment

02:29.483 --> 02:34.620
that comes with the game of bowling.
It's really a life changer.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.357
Definitely.

02:38.359 --> 02:42.461
Are you guys still in that
McMansion on Bishop?

02:43.430 --> 02:44.429
Yep.

02:44.431 --> 02:52.237
Thatcher, from my Aerial Silks Retreat said
that real estate is a great investment.

02:52.239 --> 02:55.174
Yeah, I mean it's
usually stable but...

02:55.176 --> 02:57.809
I mean there's all the work that
goes into managing a property.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.645
I can't believe you.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.347
- What?
- You're gonna ask for money at dad's funeral?

03:02.349 --> 03:05.000
I didn't ask for money.

03:05.001 --> 03:07.652
"Oh, you guys have such a nice house. What a
great investment. All that money you don't need."

03:07.655 --> 03:09.855
If you need money, we can help.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.722
Luke.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.324
What?

03:12.326 --> 03:13.559
She's family.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.661
We haven't even seen
her since our wedding.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.697
Okay, I'm gonna go.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.603
Fine. Maggie. Maggie, wait.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.440
Oh come on, don't be
such a drama queen.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.909
You don't get to play Evita at
the Beach Grove playhouse

03:30.911 --> 03:33.645
without being a little
bit of a drama queen.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.715
Well, you've always
had a talent for it.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.883
Thank you.

03:37.885 --> 03:42.821
Look, if you're gonna be in town for a while,
we should get together sometime.

03:43.924 --> 03:47.526
Coffee or you could
come by the house.

03:47.528 --> 03:51.230
I tried to start a garden,
you could come look at it.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.973
I think that dad would have liked
us to spend more time together.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.055
Yeah.

04:00.056 --> 04:03.016
Well, I guess it really doesn't
matter much anymore now, does it?

04:07.014 --> 04:08.880
That was nice.

Get me drunk.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.036

05:07.741 --> 05:08.774
Oh.

05:11.378 --> 05:14.713
- So, you don't want any more of my money?
- Not tonight I don't.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.815
Alrighty then.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.520
You're sure you're okay?
You want me to call you a cab?

05:24.058 --> 05:27.559
- How about you give me a ride?
- I don't usually...

05:27.561 --> 05:31.797
How about you give me
a ride to your house?

05:31.799 --> 05:34.733
Um, no ma'am. Thank you. No.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.967
Your loss.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.591
- Surprise!
- What are you doing here?

06:32.593 --> 06:36.661
You said you wanted to hang
out more. So, let's hang out.

06:36.663 --> 06:40.031
I... I didn't mean
at 2 in the morning.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.634
I'll go get the guest
room ready.

06:42.636 --> 06:46.104
No, Luke, wait.
What... can't you stay at Michael's?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.473
I didn't want to bother him.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.543
So, you bother us?

06:51.544 --> 06:54.624
Well, I didn't think seeing your
sister was gonna be such a bother.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.551
No, you're right. Luke,
can you grab some sheets?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.730
How about that garden?

07:11.732 --> 07:13.732
It's 2:00 a.m.

07:13.734 --> 07:19.171
Come on. I thought you said you
wanted to show it off. Come on.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.476
So, I planted some cherry
tomatoes over there

07:24.478 --> 07:30.081
and I planted some beans too-those
are over... over there somewhere.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.651
Huh?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.421
Not up
to your standards?

07:36.890 --> 07:39.958
I guess I'd be more
impressed if I could actually see it.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.616
All right, you should
be all set.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.038
Thanks for having me crash here.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.775
Wait, group hug.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.945
Come on. Come on.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.981
- Have a good night.
- Okay. Thanks.

08:13.627 --> 08:17.229
<i>Come up into

08:18.232 --> 08:21.633
<i>Exhale. Inhale.</i>

08:22.669 --> 08:29.274
<i>Now raise your right leg up into
three legged downward facing dog.</i>

08:30.577 --> 08:32.544
<i>Exhale.</i>

08:32.546 --> 08:36.581

knee into your chest.</i>

08:43.657 --> 08:44.756
It's yoga.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.659
It's relaxing.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.628
<i>Inhale.</i>

08:49.629 --> 08:51.596
Your legs are shaking.
That can't possibly be relaxing.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.132
<i>and spread your
arms into warrior...</i>

08:54.134 --> 08:56.234
I'm building up my
strength, okay?

08:56.236 --> 08:59.170
Hey, any chance you want
to build up some breakfast?

09:01.008 --> 09:02.974
I already had lunch.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.644
Yeah? Well, I had a late night.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.979
I know.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.681
Eh...

09:09.683 --> 09:11.883
- You want a pop-tart?
- Mm-Hm.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.926
Thanks for breakfast.

09:20.928 --> 09:24.829
- Got any plans today?
- My mom's coming over.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.598
Why?

09:26.600 --> 09:27.999
I don't want her to be alone.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.568
Okay, that sounds lame.

09:29.570 --> 09:34.773
I mean Luke wants to take me to disco bowling
alley but I'm not really up for it yet.

09:35.642 --> 09:39.878
- Disco bowling?
- Yeah, it's the new big thing at least around here.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.881
Sounds better than
your mom.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.116
Oh, I don't know.
We're gonna open up a bottle of wine

09:45.118 --> 09:47.852
and work on a puzzle
of the Sagrada Familia.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.956
Oh geez, you are still
such a wet blanket.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.843
Hey guys.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.028
- You sleep okay, Maggie?
- Oh yeah. I feel much better.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.197
Hey, got any big plans today?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.900
Yeah, Hannah's mom
is coming over.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.636
We're putting together
Notre Dame.

10:04.638 --> 10:05.770
Sagrada Familia.

10:05.772 --> 10:09.874
Right, Sagrada Familia.
You're welcome to join.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.844
Oh, wow. You know,

10:13.714 --> 10:17.949
as much as I love puzzles,
I think I'm gonna pass.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.951
All right. Your loss.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.332
Oh, hey. What are you up to?

10:34.334 --> 10:38.269
Oh, just checking in
on the puzzle party.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.838
Seems festive.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.614
Are you sure you
don't want to join?

10:49.149 --> 10:50.682
I'm glad to see you, Maggie.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.419
I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.956
Wow, that's really nice of you May,
but I think I'm gonna be all right.

11:00.193 --> 11:04.796
Your father would be so happy to see us
all together putting together a puzzle.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.033
You haven't even opened the box.

11:09.036 --> 11:13.304
I was speaking about it in a
more family spirit kind of way.

11:13.306 --> 11:18.343
Oh, I'm not sure dad would
want me in his spirit group.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.446
Well, he may not have always
approved of your choices

11:22.282 --> 11:24.249
but he still loved you.

11:24.251 --> 11:29.154
Yeah. Well, I guess he came around
once he got a do-over with Hannah.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.957
What?

11:31.958 --> 11:34.759
Come on, with you he got what he wanted.
Good school, good job,

11:34.761 --> 11:37.462
cookie-cutter house with the
cookie-cutter husband to match.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.365
I mean it really didn't
matter what I did.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.617
That's not fair.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.868
Well, I'm sorry for opening up
my cookie-cutter home to you.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.372
I'm sure she didn't
mean it as an insult.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.975
Of course she did. She just walks around
saying whatever the hell she wants.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.279
Should we get this
puzzle started?

11:54.281 --> 11:58.016
It was just a joke.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.785
Geez. What's
with all the drama?

12:01.488 --> 12:04.122
You are such suburbanite.

12:04.123 --> 12:07.123
Just show some respect for my family
and my home. That's all I ask.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.827
All right.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.897
- Who's ready for a drink?
- Sure, why not.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.166
No. The last thing anyone
needs are drinks.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.935
I think I should go.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.470
Mom, you don't have to go.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.290
That's okay.

12:21.291 --> 12:24.109
- Why don't we all go down to the disco bowling alley?
- Yes.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.977
I think I'll call it a night.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.179
If you need anything,
please call.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.215
Oh. Same with you.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.217
Love you.

12:35.822 --> 12:36.855
Bye, mom.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.291
Thanks.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.994
Uh-oh, naturally
this is my fault.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.229
No one said that.

12:45.065 --> 12:48.767
Sad women and disco
bowling don't mix.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.301
We are all sad.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.221
I feel fine.

12:53.222 --> 12:55.262
Then I don't know what
the hell is wrong with you.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.917
Welcome to disco bowling.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.957
Whoo!

13:12.959 --> 13:14.025
Yes!

13:30.210 --> 13:32.944
Yeah. Yeah.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.998
Come here. All right.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.505
Loser.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.978
Come one honey, you
got this. Just bowl it.

14:06.980 --> 14:10.548
You can't root for him.
We're all playing against each other.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.617
He's my husband.
I can be supportive.

14:13.920 --> 14:18.623
Why be supportive of someone who doesn't
have your best interest at heart?

14:18.625 --> 14:20.525
It's just bowling.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.778
For now.

14:23.779 --> 14:27.030
But just wait till he has to go
on a work cruise with Melissa

14:27.033 --> 14:30.969
and it's all about business but
you know what's really going on.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.271
I don't really think that's
applicable in this situation.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.975
Mm, just wait.
It's always the perfect seeming couples

14:36.977 --> 14:38.910
that have the most
skeletons in their closet.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.345
I think you've had enough.

14:40.347 --> 14:44.415
I don't think so, sister.
I'm just telling you like it is.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.152
- Yes!
- Way to go!

14:50.590 --> 14:55.994
Don't mess up, Hannah.
We'd be all so disappointed if you messed up.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.232
I'm being supportive.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.601
I want you to knock
down all of the pins.

15:04.638 --> 15:08.006
I want you to knock
down all the pins and then

15:08.008 --> 15:13.044
marry the best pin and then
have perfect little pin babies.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.414
Stop it, Maggie. Stop it.

15:22.055 --> 15:27.592
Oh, looks like she's not so perfect
after all, ladies and gentlemen.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.993
It's just bowling.

15:29.629 --> 15:30.995
For now.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.931
You think you could do better.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.132
No shit.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.138
Excuse me, just a second.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.440
- Yeah.
- We're gonna need to borrow your lane.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.308
Sure.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.976
Relax, Rosy Lee.

15:44.978 --> 15:45.576
Thank you.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.978
What are you doing?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.580
This is a bowling duel.

15:49.582 --> 15:53.418
You and me. Get in your lane.

16:10.737 --> 16:14.238
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Come on guys!

16:14.240 --> 16:18.009
This is a disgrace to the
beautiful game of bowling.

16:20.113 --> 16:24.682
Yes, I win! You're a loser.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.518
I'm not a loser. You're a loser.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.989
You just lost, dude.
You're a loser.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.161
Let's get out of here.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.432
Michael, where
are you going? Wait. What...

16:42.702 --> 16:46.437
- What are you doing here?
- Luke invited us.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.272
Then why are you leaving?

16:48.274 --> 16:51.142
I'm sick of being embarrassed
by my mom, okay.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.144
We're both adults. It shouldn't
happen anymore.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.781
It was just some friendly
competition, that's all.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.683
You were making a scene.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.220
What? Come on, don't leave.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.421
What is that? What...

17:05.125 --> 17:07.625
- What is that?
- I'm sorry, what?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.426
That ring. What's that ring?

17:10.430 --> 17:13.431
Oh, um, we're engaged.

17:15.402 --> 17:19.670
- And you didn't tell me?
- It's a private thing. It just happened.

17:20.707 --> 17:25.108
- When?
- A couple weeks ago.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.712
A couple weeks ago?
I don't believe this.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.415
Mom, I'm sorry, but we just
wanted to keep it quiet,

17:30.417 --> 17:32.698
especially with, you know,
granddad being sick and all.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.421
You're not supposed
to not tell your mother.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.289
I'm supposed to know.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.391
I know, I'm sorry
but now you know.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.532
Hey, can I come in?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.896
I... I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about what happened with Michael.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.140
Did you know he was engaged?

17:59.612 --> 18:04.348
I know things are tough but you
can still fix things with him.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.619
- What the hell do you know about that?
- Excuse me?

18:09.856 --> 18:13.257
You don't know what it's like
to be a mother, how hard it is.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.392
And you do?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.662
Yes, of course I do.

18:17.664 --> 18:21.566
You were never a mother to him.
A mother needs to be around.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.069
They need to be an adult.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.571
Now I'm supposed to take advice from
my little sister about being an adult?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.806
I was married before
you were even born.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.142
- And how'd that go?
- Oh-oh.

18:31.144 --> 18:34.312
I have a life,
a husband, a career.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.748
Right, office work,
such a career.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.352
I'll have you know,
I'm up for a big promotion at my office job.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.122
Wooptido.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.891
You don't even know what I do. You've
never asked. You only care about yourself.

18:46.893 --> 18:50.528
Right, I only care about myself
and making you miserable.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.699
You're making yourself miserable. This
train wreck act is getting a little stale.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.535
That's so profound.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.905
Do you want to publish
those thoughts?

19:00.907 --> 19:03.341
I can't keep
feeling sorry for you.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.409
Sorry for me? No.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.278
I should feel sorry for you.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.515
That boring job
and your boring life.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.484
I can do what I want.
I answer to no one.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.355
You know what? You're right, you
seem to have it all figured out.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.369
I should kick her out.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.471
- She is difficult.
- And disrespectful.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.772
But she's family.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.509
I wish my dad were here.
Maybe he could help.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.679
Your dad couldn't help her
even when he was alive.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.281
She was his wild child.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.383
And you were
his perfect princess.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.752
Right, perfect.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.854
Maybe staying with
us will ground her.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.724
Some of the perfect
might rub off on her.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.194
Yeah. Maybe she'll grow up.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.667
Who is that?

20:04.804 --> 20:06.737
That's some crazy old lady.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.575
Oh, that's bad ass. I'm
gonna go dance with her.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.743
- No, you fucking won't.
- Yes.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.349
Well, what are you waiting for?

20:23.590 --> 20:27.892
Can you come with that guy?
Cannot even believe him, he is such a tool.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.801
You dance pretty good.

20:36.803 --> 20:40.871
- What?
- I said you dance pretty good.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.474
It's pretty well.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.512
And you dance pretty mediocre.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.295
Oh...

21:08.334 --> 21:09.433
Oh.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.070
Oh, you've got
to be shitting me.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.040
What are you doing?

22:23.042 --> 22:26.043
Going through your
Playgirl stash.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.413
Get out.

22:29.415 --> 22:34.118
Sorry. I used positive
visualization to get in here

22:34.120 --> 22:38.422
and I promise to be more careful
with my powers next time.

22:38.424 --> 22:39.457
Get out.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.093
Now.

22:43.096 --> 22:46.130
Okay. Jeez.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.882
I could write better bullshit
than these idiots.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.432
You're right.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.783
...safe zone.

23:55.784 --> 23:57.133
It's a safe zone.
And everyone there is safe.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.536
No, no, no.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.688
And done.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.459
Top that, Hannah.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.680
They make me feel sentimental
but do they bring me joy.

24:42.682 --> 24:47.084
I think the question is whether or not we would
use them. And the answer is definitely not.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.186
But they might bring me joy.

24:49.188 --> 24:52.122
- Is that that Chinese woman again?
- Japanese.

24:53.125 --> 25:00.097
We have really huge houses in America. So,
if you want to keep them, we can find room.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.633
That's true.

25:02.634 --> 25:05.168
It might be too soon to thank them for
their service and send them on their way.

25:10.076 --> 25:14.078
- Well, that's not bringing you pleasure, is it?
- I'm not sure.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.182
I need a break.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.923
Hey, Hannah, come here.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.627
- What?
- You've gotta see this.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.537
<i>I know you guys usually come here to
watch me and my friends play video games</i>

25:39.539 --> 25:43.908
<i>but today I really need to bring
your attention to something.</i>

25:43.910 --> 25:47.945
- And where did you find this?
- Oh, this dude kills the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.

25:47.947 --> 25:51.082
Just hold on.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.218
<i>Now, I'm not much of a reader but you guys,
I just read a book that changed my life.</i>

25:54.220 --> 25:55.553
Hello.

25:55.555 --> 25:56.921
We're in the kitchen.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.590
<i>I Like Me</i> by Doctor
Margaret Schultz.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.982
Holy shit.

26:01.983 --> 26:04.373
<i>Now I know what
you guys are thinking.</i>

26:04.374 --> 26:07.576
<i>Max, you have thousands of subscribers,
why would you need a self-help book?</i>

26:07.600 --> 26:09.734
What are you guys watching?

26:09.735 --> 26:11.869
- Why don't you tell us?
- <i>The truth is</i>

26:11.870 --> 26:14.004
<i>sometimes I just didn't know what
direction I wanted to go in, you know.</i>

26:14.006 --> 26:17.641
<i>It felt like other people were constantly
telling me what I should be doing,</i>

26:17.643 --> 26:19.877
<i>like society or my mom.</i>

26:19.879 --> 26:22.279
- I don't get it.
- <i>But what did I really want?</i>

26:22.281 --> 26:24.882
<i>Doctor Margaret Schultz
helped me figure that out.</i>

26:24.884 --> 26:28.402
Is this video about me?

26:28.403 --> 26:31.921
<i>You see, Doctor Schultz reminded me that
what really matters in my life is me.</i>

26:31.924 --> 26:36.026
<i>I mean, it's my life and this stuff I do,
I'm the one doing it.</i>

26:36.028 --> 26:38.862
<i>My life need a more
positive in me</i>

26:38.864 --> 26:42.066
<i>and the power to say
"I like me" and I am great.</i>

26:43.069 --> 26:48.639
<i>I needed to take control of my life.
And you need to take control of yours.</i>

26:48.641 --> 26:51.308
<i>Don't listen to anyone
besides yourself. But</i>

26:51.310 --> 26:55.279
<i>also listen to me.
Definitely read</i> I Like Me.

26:56.182 --> 27:00.384
- How did this happen? Do you know him?
- So, that's your book?

27:00.386 --> 27:05.322
Well, who else could possibly
be Doctor Margaret Schultz?

27:05.324 --> 27:08.659
You're not even Doctor
Margaret Schultz.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.996
- Am I famous?
- It has two hundred thousand views.

27:11.998 --> 27:15.032
- Oh my God!
- So, you wrote a book?

27:15.034 --> 27:19.236
Yeah! But I didn't think
anyone would read it.

27:19.238 --> 27:24.308
I mean, really shouldn't have underestimated
the power of people's stupidity.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.843
Let me see here.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.783
You were my inspiration.

27:38.124 --> 27:41.358
They love me.
You should read it.

27:43.195 --> 27:48.332
Doctor Margaret Schultz got
her PhD in Social Psychology

27:48.334 --> 27:51.035
from the University
of the Pacific Rim.

27:52.071 --> 27:57.908
I was very affected by that movie.
It taught me a lot about the human psyche.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.710
I can't believe it.

27:59.712 --> 28:03.113
Wow. You believed
all the other garbage.

28:03.115 --> 28:06.183
Maybe you should try some
"positive in me" in your life.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.387
Wha...

28:12.358 --> 28:13.390
Okay.

28:15.828 --> 28:20.030
"Dear Doctor Schultz,
I am writing in the hope you can help me.

28:20.032 --> 28:24.168
I recently discovered my wife was
having an affair with our dog walker.

28:24.170 --> 28:27.905
I don't know what to do.
She is the love of my life.

28:27.907 --> 28:32.142
I don't want to lose her although she
says the dog walker is very well hung

28:32.144 --> 28:35.379
and great with our
Shih Tzu. So..." Okay.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.081
Whoo.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.450
"It's not cheating if
there's money involved."

28:40.419 --> 28:41.385
Okay.

28:41.387 --> 28:47.424
"We would love to have you as a guest to
talk about your inspirational new book."

28:48.794 --> 28:50.227
I have to find a new outfit.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.484
Yes.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.854
Congratulations.

29:16.856 --> 29:20.791
Thank you. The trick
is to believe in yourself.

29:22.294 --> 29:25.229
You know, I think
you can use my book.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.004
- Good morning.
- Hi.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.791
Okay, not so fast.

29:53.793 --> 29:54.892
Just breathe.

29:56.095 --> 29:58.262
I am key to the door of success.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.305
Hello, Hannah.
How are you today?

30:08.307 --> 30:11.008
Oh, I... I was just heading
to the copier.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.044
Is that all?

30:14.046 --> 30:17.064
Yes.

30:17.065 --> 30:20.083
Well, no. I... I thought while I was on my
way to the copier I would stop in and ask

30:20.085 --> 30:23.220
if you had received my application
for the account director position.

30:23.222 --> 30:26.023
I think all those applications
are still down at HR.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.326
Oh, okay.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.994
Do you know when
you'll be reviewing them?

30:30.996 --> 30:34.832
After HR screen them.
Maybe in a week.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.269
And I'll get through the screen, right?
Because I already work here.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.337
Sure.

30:46.879 --> 30:50.914
But I'll get through the screen, right?
I mean inside hires are cheaper.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.252
We're looking for the best
candidates, not the cheapest.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.873
Am I the best?

30:58.874 --> 31:01.274
That's really up to Dana. She
handles most of the recruiting.

31:03.295 --> 31:06.296
Well, I do recruiting
but Cheryl does the hiring.

31:08.968 --> 31:12.636
Account Director.
Account Director.

31:12.638 --> 31:17.307
Yes, it's a very important position.
They oversee the handling of accounts.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.209
Like accounting?

31:20.145 --> 31:23.881
No, like companies
we do PR work for.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.617
I think my assistant Finn
is handling that one.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.353
Great.

31:32.992 --> 31:36.260
At this point in the process we're just
running candidates through Fonterra.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.462
And where does she sit?

31:38.464 --> 31:41.031
Fonterra Recruitment Pro.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.500
It's a computer program
that screens candidates.

31:44.403 --> 31:49.273
Oh. So, would they even use that for
applicants from within the company?

31:49.275 --> 31:51.195
How else would we know
if they're qualified?

31:57.583 --> 31:59.483
I'm gonna need the living room.

31:59.485 --> 32:00.485
What?

32:03.389 --> 32:04.405
I need the living room.

32:04.406 --> 32:06.246
It's the... the living
room. Just enter it.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.425
Yes, ma'am.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.364
Luke, I thought
you left already.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.006
So...

32:57.042 --> 32:58.762
What are you doing up
before noon?

33:00.012 --> 33:02.612
Very funny, little sister.

33:04.516 --> 33:09.286
I'm sorry, she'll be out of our way in
just a second and then we can begin.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.158
Oh wait.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.695
Yes, I packed you breakfast.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.433
Remember what I always say?

33:25.104 --> 33:29.272
A healthy breakfast
is the start of a positive day.

33:29.274 --> 33:30.394
- You...
- I get it.

33:34.413 --> 33:35.413
Of course.

33:36.482 --> 33:37.748
Thank you.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.318
It was nice to meet you.

33:53.465 --> 33:59.069
Okay. So, your son boinked
your neighbor's wife, right?

33:59.071 --> 34:02.539
What? No. I boinked...

34:03.575 --> 34:06.576
I mean I slept with
the neighbor's wife.

34:06.578 --> 34:11.581
Wow. For a second there I thought we had a
classic Mrs. Robinson situation on our hands.

34:13.118 --> 34:14.284
A what?

34:14.286 --> 34:16.053
You know, from <i> The Graduate</i>.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.081
Well, how did you know
her name was Robinson?

34:21.126 --> 34:22.759
I have that sense.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.129
It's what I do.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.206
You've gotta be kidding me.

34:39.610 --> 34:43.380
- Hey, someone left this book in my office?
- Yep.

34:43.382 --> 34:48.685
That was me. And you, you gotta read it.
It literally changed my life.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.788
- Oh it did, did it?
- Oh yeah.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.324
This Doctor Schultz is a genius.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.460
It's like she can read my mind.

34:56.462 --> 34:59.296
To be honest, I think it can
help you with the promotion.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.700
Well, thank you.

35:03.702 --> 35:04.801
You're welcome.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.471
You know that's my sister.

35:07.473 --> 35:10.540
- No way.
- Oh yeah. well, my half-sister.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.143
Oh my God. Are you guys close?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.512
You could say that.

35:15.514 --> 35:22.385
Wow. I mean, when you see her,
you tell her that she has a fan in me.

35:22.387 --> 35:25.856
I'll have plenty of opportunities.
She lives in my guest room.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.898
- Hey, I'm gonna get some coffee. Do you want any?
- No.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.840
Okay. Relax. Just relax.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.151
Happy place.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.186
Happy place.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.421
Happy place.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.161
No. Screw it.

36:06.231 --> 36:07.430
Sad place.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.839
I feel really good about the
progress that we made today.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.608
That'll be hundred dollars.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.878
- You brought cash, right?
- Well, of course. Of course.

36:23.415 --> 36:26.316
- Bless you.
- Oh, bless you.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.975
So, what... what will you
be having, sweetheart?

36:51.977 --> 36:54.611
Oh. I don't know.

36:55.581 --> 36:58.741
You don't know? If you're gonna sit here,
I think you should drink here.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.784
- Beer.
- Beer.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.553
Could you be a bit
more specific?

37:05.791 --> 37:06.791
No. Wine.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.626
- Wine.
- Definitely wine.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.427
Definitely wine.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.628
- Red.
- Red.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.631
- And cheap.
- Cheap red wine. We got that.

37:16.969 --> 37:18.501
Here you go.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.560
Hannah.

37:43.562 --> 37:44.694
Yeah!

37:44.696 --> 37:46.696
Not you. Hannah.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.733
She's not back from
work yet. What's up?

37:52.537 --> 37:56.506
I sold five hundred thousand
copies of my book.

37:57.676 --> 38:01.311
- Is that good?
- Yeah, I think so.

38:01.313 --> 38:08.018
I mean it's just a book but I mean that's
pretty much everyone that still reads, right?

38:08.020 --> 38:09.586
Yeah, I guess so.

38:10.589 --> 38:11.955
You want to play Call of Duty?

38:13.759 --> 38:15.492
You know what?

38:15.494 --> 38:18.295
Yes. Yes, I do.

38:19.731 --> 38:23.900
Okay. So, left joystick move,
right joystick orientation,

38:23.902 --> 38:28.705
hold down the left trigger to aim and then
right trigger is shoot. Okay? And go.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.775
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:31.777 --> 38:35.478
Do I have to push any of these
pretty buttons over here?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.480
Don't worry about those.
Only if you need to jump.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.916
Shoot him. Shoot.
Shoot that guy right there. Right there.

38:39.918 --> 38:40.850
Terrorist. Terrorist.

38:40.852 --> 38:46.456
Shoot. Shoot. Shoot the terrorist. That's a
terrorist. That is a terrorist. Shoot him.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.525
Oh. Hey.

38:49.361 --> 38:52.362
Maggie just sold five hundred
thousand copies of her book.

38:52.364 --> 38:53.830
Isn't that amazing?

38:55.834 --> 38:57.767
Yes, it's wonderful.

39:02.407 --> 39:03.873
What's her problem?

39:04.743 --> 39:06.076
Must have had a hard day.

39:07.713 --> 39:08.812
She'll be fine.

39:09.815 --> 39:10.780
- Okay, go.
- Oh, wait.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.115
Go, go, go, go, go. Terrorist.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.350
My God.

39:19.991 --> 39:25.061
Welcome back to "Hello Hello." And let's
give a hello, hello, hello to our guest,

39:25.063 --> 39:28.832
life coach and hit author
Doctor Margaret Schultz.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.834
Thank you for having me, Rita.

39:30.836 --> 39:34.537
Let's start off with a burning
question everyone is dying to know.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.539
What is your morning
beauty routine?

39:36.541 --> 39:39.542
Oh, well, that's a very
interesting question.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.780
I would say yoga,

39:44.850 --> 39:47.751
avocado facial mask

39:47.753 --> 39:50.871
and grapefruit.

39:50.872 --> 39:53.990
That's great. That's great.
I am quite the yogini myself. Namaste.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.693
Namastadi indeed.

39:56.695 --> 40:00.864
Now this book, full disclosure,
I am a journalist and all,

40:00.866 --> 40:05.668
I've not finished it yet, but there's
so much buzz around it. Why is that?

40:05.670 --> 40:10.006
I think I'm getting at something that's
really bothering a lot of people.

40:10.008 --> 40:13.710
With so many people in the world,
we're forgetting about ourselves.

40:13.712 --> 40:14.811
Too true.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.147
I was having this
problem myself and

40:17.149 --> 40:22.519
then I realized that all I had to do was
look deep inside myself and realize that

40:22.521 --> 40:24.654
I like me...

40:24.656 --> 40:26.723
And find out why.

40:26.725 --> 40:30.927
And this book is helping
people find out that why.

40:30.929 --> 40:34.764
Wow. That is so inspirational.

40:34.766 --> 40:40.470
Do you have any advice for any young aspiring
writers out there who may be watching today

40:40.472 --> 40:43.740
and saying to themselves,
"How can I be like her?"

40:43.742 --> 40:45.508
Well, yes I do.

40:47.813 --> 40:52.515
Follow the advice in my book
and live your dreams.

40:52.517 --> 40:55.218
No one is stopping you but you.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.054
We are all great.

40:58.056 --> 41:02.058
Just look inside you and realize
how much you love yourself

41:02.060 --> 41:05.161
and spread that love
into the world.

41:05.997 --> 41:11.067
I like me and I am
great and so can you.

41:12.537 --> 41:15.839
Well, that's all the time we have today.
It's been a pleasure.

41:15.841 --> 41:19.609
<i>I Like Me</i> by Doctor Margaret
Schultz available online.

41:19.611 --> 41:22.145
I urge you all to get
your copy today.

41:37.062 --> 41:38.962
Thanks for tonight.
I needed this.

41:38.964 --> 41:42.499
Thank you. Dinner would
not have been as nice alone.

41:43.168 --> 41:46.135
How would I have eaten all that cheese by myself?

41:47.506 --> 41:49.973
You're such a goofball.

41:49.975 --> 41:51.508
I love you.

41:51.510 --> 41:52.742
I love you too.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.012
What is going on?

41:57.749 --> 41:59.082
Maggie!

42:04.256 --> 42:06.022
It's still! Run!

42:11.663 --> 42:14.864
Yo, Doctor Schultz is
the shit at beer bong, man.

42:14.866 --> 42:18.768
Great. Can you please get all of
these people out of my house?

42:18.770 --> 42:24.841
Oh, lighten up. My book sold
five hundred thousand copies.

42:24.843 --> 42:28.245
We're celebrating.

42:28.246 --> 42:31.648
Whoo! Five hundred thousand
books! Books! Books! Books!

42:31.650 --> 42:34.150
Books! Books!

42:35.120 --> 42:36.319
Luke!

42:40.292 --> 42:43.560
They're already here, right?
We might as well have fun.

42:43.562 --> 42:46.162
God damn it.
Are all you people insane?

42:47.265 --> 42:53.570
Maggie! Maggie! Maggie!
Maggie! Maggie! Maggie!

43:00.145 --> 43:01.711
Hey, you leaving already?

43:02.681 --> 43:04.614
We... we need

43:04.616 --> 43:07.083
more booze.

43:08.153 --> 43:10.219
I'll pay if you give me
a lift somewhere.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.022
Okay.

43:13.024 --> 43:13.923
Yep.

43:13.925 --> 43:19.696
I'm... I'm... I'm really glad we
finally got some time alone.

43:21.066 --> 43:22.765
I really... I really like you.

43:23.668 --> 43:25.001
You what?

43:25.003 --> 43:26.636
Um...

43:26.638 --> 43:28.938
I... I really like you.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.942
Okay. So, do you think you
could just keep pushing?

43:34.212 --> 43:35.378
Yeah.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.880
- Thanks.
- But... but I... I like you.

43:39.050 --> 43:40.050
Hey, Michael.

43:41.886 --> 43:42.886
Michael!

43:46.057 --> 43:47.757
Can I help you?

43:47.759 --> 43:51.861
Can you tell Michael
mom is here?

43:51.863 --> 43:53.196
Michael's not here.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.165
Did he move?

43:56.167 --> 43:59.102
No. He's on his honeymoon.

43:59.104 --> 44:00.303
You're his mom?

44:01.373 --> 44:03.272
Yes.

44:03.274 --> 44:06.309
I'm pretty confident
of the maternity.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.312
Then how come I didn't
see you at the wedding?

44:37.108 --> 44:38.875
I can clean this.

44:39.811 --> 44:41.678
Really? You can clean it up?

44:43.148 --> 44:44.847
You knew about
Michael, didn't you?

44:44.849 --> 44:48.985
Just leave everything to Hannah,
she'll take care of everything?

44:48.987 --> 44:50.853
Listen to me.

44:50.855 --> 44:51.855
What?

44:53.091 --> 44:54.924
You knew he got married?

44:56.761 --> 44:57.761
Yeah.

44:58.930 --> 44:59.930
We knew.

45:01.166 --> 45:03.199
Luke, can you just
give us a minute?

45:05.370 --> 45:06.370
All right.

45:13.144 --> 45:16.813
They told us about
the wedding. it was small.

45:16.815 --> 45:20.216
- They didn't want a big thing.
- How could you do that?

45:20.218 --> 45:23.186
I didn't want to get in the
middle of a private issue.

45:23.188 --> 45:25.254
You didn't want to
get in the middle?

45:26.157 --> 45:27.423
You're supposed to be my sister.

45:27.425 --> 45:30.093
And you're supposed
to be his mother.

45:30.095 --> 45:33.496
- Again, what does that mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

45:34.999 --> 45:37.166
Oh, fuck this.

45:37.168 --> 45:39.402
Maggie, where are you going?

45:39.404 --> 45:40.404
Come on.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.351
Ma'am, are you alright?

45:57.222 --> 45:59.873
Yes. I'm great.

45:59.874 --> 46:03.234
Well, do you mind getting out?
You're in the middle of my birthday party.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.428
Oh.

46:05.163 --> 46:06.163
Okay.

46:22.046 --> 46:24.180
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

46:38.029 --> 46:41.063
- Do you want something to drink or anything?
- Nope.

46:45.336 --> 46:46.536
Why don't you have a seat?

46:52.544 --> 46:53.910
Is everything alright?

46:55.013 --> 46:58.281
Yes. Why wouldn't
everything be alright?

46:58.283 --> 46:59.283
Okay.

47:00.218 --> 47:01.951
You were at Michael's wedding.

47:03.288 --> 47:04.387
Yes, I was.

47:04.389 --> 47:06.222
Of course you were.

47:07.859 --> 47:09.025
You don't look right.

47:09.027 --> 47:16.933
You know, he thinks you're the good guy and
I'm this super villain. But he has no idea.

47:19.370 --> 47:20.837
Are you still at Hannah's?

47:21.506 --> 47:24.006
Yes, but not because
I have to be.

47:24.008 --> 47:27.844
In case you didn't know, I am
a best-selling author now.

47:27.846 --> 47:29.078
Right.

47:31.115 --> 47:34.917
- Well, aren't you gonna congratulate me?
- Congratulations.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.486
Yep.

47:37.488 --> 47:39.956
Doctor Schultz.

47:39.958 --> 47:41.991
I think you should
get some rest.

47:41.993 --> 47:43.753
Well, I'm glad that's
what you think.

47:47.131 --> 47:50.166
You know, I used
to be his favorite.

47:50.168 --> 47:54.370
I was the fun one. You were always
this fuddy-duddy rule follower.

47:54.372 --> 47:57.006
Well, if a fuddy-duddy
rule follower

47:57.008 --> 48:00.910
means that I was around
for my son, I'm okay with that.

48:00.912 --> 48:02.345
I was around.

48:02.347 --> 48:04.380
You were gone for
months at a time...

48:04.382 --> 48:09.886
traveling theater troupes, silent retreats,
poetic explorations, the circus.

48:09.888 --> 48:13.389
Never the circus. And he
could have come with me.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.124
He had school.

48:15.126 --> 48:16.926
I could have homeschooled.

48:16.928 --> 48:20.363
Look, what's done is done.
He turned out great.

48:22.100 --> 48:25.201
He hates me.

48:25.202 --> 48:28.303
He doesn't hate you. He cares about you.
We all care about you.

48:28.306 --> 48:33.075
He's just trying to figure out how to
fit you into his life. That's all.

48:34.979 --> 48:36.279
Ugh.

49:04.642 --> 49:07.443
- Yes?
- Oh my God, you're Doctor Schultz.

49:08.413 --> 49:10.112
Yes, I... I am.

49:10.114 --> 49:11.948
You changed my life.

49:11.950 --> 49:15.685
I never realized how great I
could be until I read your book.

49:15.687 --> 49:18.254
Oh, that makes me really happy.

49:18.256 --> 49:20.456
I've read it so many times.

49:21.426 --> 49:24.694
I wish I had your book with me
so I could get you to sign it.

49:24.696 --> 49:28.664
Oh, that would have been great,
wouldn't it have? Hi sweetie.

49:28.666 --> 49:30.166
Sign me!

49:31.736 --> 49:33.469
Excuse me?

49:33.471 --> 49:36.305
I want your mark on me forever.

49:37.709 --> 49:43.179
You know, the permanent and permanent marker
really doesn't meant... okay, okay. Okay.

49:49.220 --> 49:50.319
Oh.

49:51.522 --> 49:55.591
Thank you. And bless your soul.

49:55.593 --> 49:57.159
Bless you too.

50:20.018 --> 50:25.054
"When all else fails, look to yourself,
you have all the answers."

50:29.427 --> 50:31.460
"Don't put yourself on a shelf."

50:32.563 --> 50:36.232
"Remember, I like me
and I am great."

50:37.435 --> 50:40.603
God. I'm a fucking genius.

50:41.439 --> 50:44.206
So, the whole thing kind
of blew up in my face.

50:44.208 --> 50:49.512
But what am I supposed to do when my nephew
tells me not to tell his mom about his wedding?

50:49.514 --> 50:54.050
What sort of positive outcome could
I visualize in that situation?

50:54.052 --> 50:56.419
But... but she's still
living with you?

50:56.421 --> 50:59.221
She seems quite
committed to the idea.

50:59.223 --> 51:02.591
I don't think I've ever seen her have such
strong follow through on something before.

51:02.593 --> 51:05.795
Well, she also started
a self-help movement.

51:05.797 --> 51:07.363
Yeah.

51:07.365 --> 51:09.285
Hannah, could I please
see you in my office?

51:10.568 --> 51:11.767
Yes, of course.

51:13.271 --> 51:14.336
All right.

51:20.111 --> 51:23.345
I wanted you to be the first to
know that you didn't get the job.

51:25.616 --> 51:27.716
Did... didn't... didn't
get the job?

51:27.718 --> 51:30.419
Did not. I'm very sorry.

51:33.191 --> 51:38.160
But why? I... I... I've been here five years,
I'm a leader, I'm... I'm qualified.

51:38.162 --> 51:41.397
That's all true but there was
someone more qualified.

51:41.399 --> 51:44.200
- Who? An outside hire?
- Jermaine.

51:45.136 --> 51:46.602
- Jermaine?
- Yes.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.138
I'm very sorry about this.

51:49.140 --> 51:49.738
But

51:49.740 --> 51:56.412
I really look forward to seeing all the great
work you continue to do in your current capacity.

51:59.550 --> 52:01.283
Now if you could please leave.

52:13.364 --> 52:14.563
Congratulations.

52:16.134 --> 52:18.634
Thank you. Hey, I'm
pretty sure it was close.

52:20.338 --> 52:21.871
Close doesn't cut it.

52:21.873 --> 52:25.441
Look, I know you may
not be her biggest fan

52:25.443 --> 52:28.611
but to be honest, I feel like you
should read your sister's book.

52:28.613 --> 52:33.149
I don't think I would have gotten the
job without it. Maybe it can help you.

52:37.255 --> 52:38.921
Un-fucking-believable.

52:42.927 --> 52:45.895
I like me and I am great.

52:45.897 --> 52:48.764
I like me and I am great.

52:48.766 --> 52:51.901
I like me and I am great.

52:54.805 --> 52:57.306
Step two, jogging.

53:00.444 --> 53:02.444
Hi. Want to join me?

53:02.446 --> 53:03.812
Doing what?

53:03.814 --> 53:05.414
Jogging.

53:05.416 --> 53:08.584
- You jog?
- Of course. It's in my book.

53:08.586 --> 53:11.453
Healthy living and eating clean.

53:11.455 --> 53:14.757
- What does eating clean mean?
- Wash your hands?

53:20.665 --> 53:23.766
Hey, how was work?

53:23.768 --> 53:25.401
I didn't get the promotion.

53:28.406 --> 53:30.639
My bowling team
didn't make the playoffs.

53:31.542 --> 53:34.343
- What?
- Well, technically we were disqualified

53:34.345 --> 53:37.813
because as it turns out Ronnie was
taking performance-enhancing drugs.

53:37.815 --> 53:41.584
But it's like should we all get punished
because of Ronnie's Napoleon complex?

53:41.586 --> 53:43.819
Luke, what about my thing?

53:43.821 --> 53:45.521
What thing?

53:45.523 --> 53:49.291
Oh, yeah, that really sucks.

53:49.293 --> 53:50.593
But you're young.

53:51.762 --> 53:54.697
You still have time
to work your way up.

53:54.698 --> 53:57.633
Yeah, but it's still really disappointing.
I wanted to move on to something new.

53:57.635 --> 53:58.635
Yeah.

53:59.570 --> 54:00.570
For sure.

54:04.775 --> 54:06.542
I'm gonna go to bed.

54:06.544 --> 54:08.864
- You want to get something to eat?
- No.

54:40.845 --> 54:41.845

Nope.

what about you?

55:46.477 --> 55:48.744
Welcome!

55:48.746 --> 55:50.879
- This really works.
- Yeah!

55:50.881 --> 55:52.881
- Are you sure?
- Hope so because this sucks.

55:54.552 --> 55:56.585
Talking to come.

55:56.587 --> 55:59.488
- What?
- I'm not totally clueless.

56:00.758 --> 56:03.492
It's marriage, right?
Ups and downs.

56:03.494 --> 56:05.174
You should come
to one of my meetings.

56:07.698 --> 56:10.499
Think about it.
It's not as bad as it seems.

56:21.512 --> 56:22.878
Jesus Christ.

56:30.855 --> 56:34.089
Welcome. Everyone,
welcome Hannah.

56:34.091 --> 56:36.525
Welcome, Hannah.

56:36.527 --> 56:38.026
Thanks.

56:38.028 --> 56:39.995
Why don't you come in
and have a seat?

56:46.804 --> 56:51.473
Now, why don't you tell us what's
causing you anxiety today?

56:53.444 --> 56:55.043
Well, um,

56:55.913 --> 56:58.814
my dad died recently

56:58.816 --> 57:04.186
and I was passed over
for this promotion at work and

57:05.423 --> 57:08.991
I feel a little unappreciated
at home.

57:08.993 --> 57:13.195
Could it be that you don't
appreciate yourself enough?

57:13.197 --> 57:14.496
Mmm.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.467
No, I don't think that's it.

57:18.469 --> 57:24.840
It sounds to me like you're not
thinking about what makes you great.

57:24.842 --> 57:27.576
And that's what's leading
to these struggles.

57:30.848 --> 57:33.482
Hannah, repeat after me.

57:36.086 --> 57:38.587
Please make eye contact with me.

57:42.726 --> 57:47.563
I like me and I am great.

57:50.100 --> 57:52.634
I like me and I am great.

57:53.504 --> 57:54.970
Okay.

57:54.972 --> 57:57.039
Well, I didn't really
believe that.

57:58.075 --> 58:01.477
Should we show her
how it's done, everyone?

58:01.479 --> 58:04.680
I like me and I am great.

58:04.682 --> 58:06.915
I like me and I am great.

58:06.917 --> 58:08.116
Again.

58:08.118 --> 58:10.219
I like me and I am great.

58:10.221 --> 58:11.220
One more time.

58:11.222 --> 58:13.222
I like me and I am great.

58:13.224 --> 58:14.690
Keep it going.

58:14.691 --> 58:16.157
I like me and I am great.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.694
I like me and I am great!

58:18.696 --> 58:20.729
I like me and I am great!

58:20.731 --> 58:23.265
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up!

58:25.202 --> 58:30.105
Hannah, we try to only use positive
words in this environment.

58:31.041 --> 58:33.909
Oh, shove it up
your ass, Maggie.

58:33.911 --> 58:37.546
Now, I know you're upset.

58:37.548 --> 58:40.649
Why don't we try and rephrase
that in a more positive manner?

58:41.585 --> 58:43.852
You're all so full of shit.

58:45.055 --> 58:47.756
I mean, you all look up
to her and worship her.

58:47.758 --> 58:50.692
You know why?
Because you're all worthless.

58:50.694 --> 58:54.963
You... you haven't accomplished shit in your
lives and now you think maybe this will work.

58:54.965 --> 58:57.099
Well guess what?
That's not how life is!

58:58.035 --> 59:00.802
Why don't we just
sit down and relax?

59:00.804 --> 59:03.939
No, no, no, I will not relax.

59:03.940 --> 59:07.075
You... you... you... you cannot wish or...
or love anything into existence.

59:07.077 --> 59:10.012
The world is not your playground.
No one gives a shit about you,

59:10.014 --> 59:13.749
not your family, not your friends,
and certainly not Doctor Schultz.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.785
When we're gone,
our time on this earth

59:16.787 --> 59:19.621
will have been useless
and will all be forgotten!

59:21.759 --> 59:27.296
I think we need to try and refrain from taking
your anger out on these wonderful people.

59:27.298 --> 59:29.965
I'll take my anger out
wherever I see fit.

59:32.603 --> 59:35.037
I like me and I am great.

59:35.906 --> 59:38.941
I like me and I am great.

59:38.943 --> 59:42.044
I like me and I am great.

59:42.046 --> 59:44.813
I like me and I am great.

59:44.815 --> 59:46.648

I'm gonna kick her out.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:17.893
Hi. I'm gonna pick you up at
work and take you out to dinner.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.805
Oh, whatever.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:32.340
I'm rich now.

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:16.218
After the many months of
working with the monks in Tibet,

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:20.589
I found what really works
is focusing on everything

01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:23.158
that is good about ourselves.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.930
Only then could you then spread
that goodness out into the world.

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:29.965
Wow.

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:33.101
That is truly inspirational.

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.202
Right?

01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:36.938
Why did you go to Tibet?

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.342
Was there something you
were trying to deal with?

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:44.613
No, nothing that I was
personally dealing with.

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:51.987
It was more of a search for spiritual
truth on behalf of my clients.

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:55.390
Max, have you been studying for
your geometry test on Monday?

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.125
Mom, we're recording.

01:04:57.127 --> 01:05:01.296
Oh, oh, you're recording.
I thought you said you were contorting

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:03.999
- and I got a bit worried.
- Mom, please.

01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:06.935
Sorry. I'll get
out of your hair.

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:10.438
Um, I was about to make some
grilled cheese for lunch.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.308
- Would your friend like some?
- Oh, I'd love some.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:19.915
Okay, I've got white or wheat bread...
well, actually it's potato and wheat bread.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.651
- Is potato considered white?
- Mom, we're busy.

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:25.553
Wheat would be great.

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:34.095
She can be so annoying
sometimes.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:38.066
It's okay. I'm a daughter
of a mother. I understand.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:44.139
Sometimes she would
just leave, you know.

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:47.175
Right. I mean,
wouldn't it be great

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:51.179
if she went like on a three-month she went
like on a three-month poetry slam tour?

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:53.698
What?

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:56.216
No, it's just the saying, she
couldn't actually leave. I mean,

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:59.287
who'd make my lunch
or do my laundry?

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:02.744
Well, you could go with her,
wouldn't that be exciting?

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.260
What about school?

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:08.997
What is with you people
and school?

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:11.166
I'm fifteen, I don't
want to be a truant.

01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:14.569
Anyway, let's get back on topic.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:17.739
So, your life was perfect

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:21.676
but you went to Tibet
to help your clients?

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:24.980
Right.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:27.550
Well,

01:06:29.052 --> 01:06:31.119
maybe it wasn't
all about my clients.

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:36.658
I might have needed some
help from the monks too.

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:42.697
Maybe I needed the monks
to help me better myself.

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:50.238
But I thought that the me that
we are is the best me we can be.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:55.611
I gotta go.

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:00.596
But what about lunch?

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:06.755
Christ what? What is-
...what is wrong?

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:11.126
Could I come in for a moment?

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:15.730
Um, sure, fine.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.241
You can sit there.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.609
- Thank you.
- Mm-Hm.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.347
I heard you visited dad.

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:35.216
Yes.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.719
I know we haven't always
seen eye-to-eye

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.655
but I think it's important
to keep him in my life.

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:41.657
Right.

01:07:43.794 --> 01:07:45.193
Have you read my book yet?

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:48.530
No. I've been busy, I'm sorry.

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.298
Not a problem.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.500
I happen to have
a copy right here.

01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:59.674
You know once you read the book,
you'll see the error of your ways.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:02.343
The error of my ways?

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.380
Not including me
in your wedding.

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:06.714
Oh, right.

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:10.685
I wanted to talk to you about that.
You see, the reason why you...

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:16.691
You'll see in the book that it all comes
down to you not liking yourself enough.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:20.127
And if you could admit
that you like you,

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:23.631
then you could have spread that
acceptance out into the world to me and

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:27.535
would have invited me to come.

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:30.705
Actually, that's not
the reason why.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:33.174
No.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:35.642
This whole wedding business is you
expressing your "negative in me"

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:38.379
instead of your
"positive in me."

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:42.617
It really is a common mistake with
those who aren't my followers.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:46.254
Could you please just stop for
just a second? I want to talk...

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:50.457
But once you read the book and
come to a few of my meetings,

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.728
you'll realize that
you were wrong all along.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:56.397
I mean you'll
learn to like yourself

01:08:56.399 --> 01:09:00.602
and realize that you're
great and I'm great too.

01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:03.270
See, this is... this is why.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:05.874
- Huh?
- This is why I didn't invite you.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.211
Because you always
make it about yourself.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.714
I don't see how this
is about me at all.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:15.350
Well, then you need
to be more self aware.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:17.484
I wrote the book
on being self aware.

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:24.392
I don't see how you get off
saying this is about me at all.

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:28.196
This has always
been about you.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.399
Driving you to school,

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:34.536
making you dinner,

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:39.439
wiping your ass when you
shit yourself as a baby.

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:41.309
That's what parents
are supposed to do.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:46.481
And then I would offer to make you
and your friends grilled cheese

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:48.316
and you wouldn't even thank me.

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:49.684
When did that ever happen?

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:52.819
Well, you know what?

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:54.556
I don't care what you think.

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:59.661
I like me and I am great.

01:09:59.663 --> 01:10:02.397
This has nothing to do
with not liking you.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.518
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.652
What are you up to?

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:26.754
Nothing.

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:29.490
I've got something
for you to do.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:33.828
I can't do anything.
I'm terrible at everything.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.697
You know that's not true.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.433
What do you want from me?

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.304
I want you to talk to Maggie.

01:10:43.306 --> 01:10:46.341
What? No. Why?

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:50.778
She was just over at Michael's
and he said she was really upset.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.715
That's her own damn fault.
I'm not gonna let her ruin my life anymore.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:54.849
Oh.

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:59.454
And how has she
ruined your life?

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.591
- She gave Jermaine confidence.
- Mm.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.594
- She attacked me with an army of her minions.
- Mmm.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:09.564
And she probably
gave my dad cancer.

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:11.599
That's ridiculous.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.969
Well, stress can do a lot
of damage to a person.

01:11:15.839 --> 01:11:16.839
Hmm.

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:21.809
You should talk to her.

01:11:24.681 --> 01:11:30.652
You're calm, you're kind and you're
really the only person she has left now.

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.022
Yeah, maybe.

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:49.904
Hi. I'd like to see if I can
sell any of these books.

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:53.675
All right. Let me take a look.

01:12:01.618 --> 01:12:04.719
All right. Looks like this
is the only one we'll take.

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:09.023
- Really just... just the one?
- Yeah.

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:12.827
You'd be surprised how many people come
in to offload their self-help books

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:15.749
when they realize there's nothing
they can do with their sad lives.

01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:22.737
Or maybe they were just so successful
they didn't need them anymore.

01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:24.972
Right. That could be it.

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:32.580
I'm like perfectly happy, so don't go
waving around your generalizations at me.

01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:33.648
Okay.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:37.485
I'm doing so great that I know
I'll never need these books again,

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:41.306
so you can just have them all.

01:12:41.307 --> 01:12:45.126
Well, we really only want the one, ma'am.
So, would that be cash or store credit?

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:47.662
Cash.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:04.512
Oh, hey, you're Doctor
Margret Schultz's sister, right?

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:06.748
Yes. And... and you are?

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.684
I'm a friend first and a client.

01:13:09.686 --> 01:13:12.387
It may be something more
someday if she lets me.

01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:15.990
Um, okay.

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:19.394
Is she alright? I haven't
seen her in a while.

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:22.830
Oh, I don't know, she doesn't
live with me anymore.

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:25.867
Well, next time you see her, could...
could you tell her to call me?

01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:29.737
Our meetings have really been helping
me get in touch with my inner self.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.875
I'll be sure to mention it.

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:37.162
Thanks.
Thank you so much.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:40.523
You know I can see the path, I'm just
having trouble clearing out the weeds.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.718
- Sure.
- Yeah.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.720
Sweet, all right.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.956
<i>An apple pie?</i>

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:52.026
<i>You think I need a fucking apple pie?</i>

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:55.196
<i>You're so useless.</i>

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:58.766
Oh shit.

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:01.067
<i>What would he think?
No wonder he left us.</i>

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:05.606
No go away, I don't
want any room service.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:06.808
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.576
It's Hannah.

01:14:08.578 --> 01:14:10.711
Can you please open the door?

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:12.647
I'll be nice. I promise.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.850
<i>Can
you just be more like...</i>

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:17.886
<i>Fine.</i>

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:28.896
<i>You doing some early
spring cleaning?</i>

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:31.467
<i>Mom.</i>

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:36.070
<i>Are you in...</i>

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.040
What happened here?

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.510
Negative in me.

01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:46.047
<i>Sorry.
I found this in my desk.</i>

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:48.549
<i>Yeah? What is
that? What are you doing?</i>

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:52.086
<i>Oh, come on.
You wore at that Halloween. Would you like...</i>

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:53.187
Is that you?

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:55.923
<i>You know, you're at the mall.</i>

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:57.558
<i>Had to have that even though...</i>

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.377
Yeah.

01:14:59.378 --> 01:15:01.195
I did a TV pilot a
couple of years ago.

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:03.764
Wow, that's impressive.

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:05.900
Yeah.

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:08.035
I mean it was never really
officially picked up by a network

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:11.172
and we had to stop
halfway through because the...

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:15.276
the main backer, well, he
got arrested for racketeering.

01:15:15.278 --> 01:15:16.744
Jesus.

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:18.045
Yeah.

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:20.515
But I really thought it
had some potential.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:25.853
Are you here to yell at me?

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:30.825
No, I'm here because
Luke told me to come.

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:34.262
Great.

01:15:34.264 --> 01:15:37.965
But also because I ran into
some frat bro at a bookstore

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:42.203
and he said you're good at
clearing the weeds from the past.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:43.871
Like yard work?

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.573
No, like life advice.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:47.608
Oh.

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:52.580
I don't think I'm really qualified
to give anybody life advice.

01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:55.983
I'll take anything
I can get at this point.

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:59.020
Uh, girlfriend,

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:01.589
I think I am all out of mantras.

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:07.028
Hey, why don't you consult one
of those stupid books of yours?

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:08.229
I sold them all.

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:11.032
Really?

01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:14.035
Well, I tried to but the bookstore
didn't want most of them.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:17.104
But I'm definitely planning
on getting rid of them soon.

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:20.207
Do you still have them
with you now?

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:31.152
Okay. So, can I give
you a bit of advice?

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.506
Sure.

01:16:35.507 --> 01:16:37.257
Always aim for the
biggest payoff.

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:40.227
Is that your new mantra?

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:42.129
Huh, I don't know.

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:43.664
I guess it could be.

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:47.736
Hey!

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.037
Maggie?

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:52.274
No.

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:02.683
So, do you think I can move back in
with you just for a little while?

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:05.052
I thought you were
a self-made millionaire.

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:10.691
Well, it seems that online publishing is not
the goldmine that most people think it is.

01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:14.228
Sure. I guess.

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:15.296
Thank you.

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:20.768
But you're gonna have to do
some of the household chores.

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:23.104
You've got to earn your
keep in this sisterhood.

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:26.941
Oh Jesus. We're not gonna
have to sit in the Red Tent too?

01:17:28.411 --> 01:17:29.777
Okay, deal.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.880
Ready?

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:35.650
Oh!

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:04.979
I saved you a pair of sevens.

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:06.447
Oh, thank you.

01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:10.051
Welcome. You need all the
help you can in this game.

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:13.721
The least I can do is give you
a properly sized pair of shoes.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:22.363
That was for you.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:24.098
That was pretty...

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:30.438
<i>♪ All my life I was waiting
For someone ♪</i>

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.874
<i>♪ Was waiting
For someone to love ♪</i>

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:37.011
<i>♪ Someone to love ♪</i>

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:39.012
Hey, guys, I'll be
back in a second.

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:40.781
<i>♪ Someone to love ♪</i>

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:44.251
Next one is for you.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.362
Oh!

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.034
Hey, better luck
next time, guys.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:02.269
It's not fair. You're
practically a professional.

01:19:03.106 --> 01:19:06.474
- Hey, has mom come back yet?
- Um, I don't think so.

01:19:10.046 --> 01:19:11.326
I think I found a clue.

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:17.151
"Hannah, thank you for all you've
done for me over the past months,

01:19:17.153 --> 01:19:19.386
namely letting me
live in your home.

01:19:19.388 --> 01:19:21.388
That was very sisterly of you.

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.291
And because you are my
sister, I hope I can entrust you

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:27.328
with letting everyone know

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:30.364
that I'm off to lead a therapeutic
water polo retreat in Santa Cruz."

01:19:30.366 --> 01:19:32.166
What?

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:35.603
"After watching so much bowling,

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:39.039
I really think I can help people sort out
their problems through physical aggression.

01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:43.344
Also, if you could let my boss know, I will
be absent for a while, that would be great.

01:19:43.346 --> 01:19:44.812
Hugs, Maggie."

01:19:57.927 --> 01:20:00.561
Well, what did we expect?

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.232
I guess I thought she'd changed.

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:10.571
At least she left a note, right?

01:20:15.111 --> 01:20:16.944
You guys wanna bowl
another round?

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:18.546
- Yeah.
- Sure.

01:20:18.548 --> 01:20:19.548
All right.
