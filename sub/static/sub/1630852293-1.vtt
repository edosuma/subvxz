WEBVTT

00:09.480 --> 00:10.400
Please come in.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.839
So...

00:12.359 --> 00:14.759
-This way, Federico.
-Shall I sit here?

00:14.880 --> 00:16.679
-Yes, Chiara, this way.
-Okay.

00:17.039 --> 00:18.760
Welcome here.

00:19.559 --> 00:23.199
Lovely. So there are no...
There are cameras.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.079
Lovely.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.280
What do we do?

00:27.559 --> 00:30.679
Just talk, honey.
What do you think you should do?

00:33.119 --> 00:35.039
-Good morning.
-Morning. Welcome.

00:35.119 --> 00:36.280
Good morning.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.280
You can go start while I get comfortable.

00:40.960 --> 00:46.200
Be as direct as possible in telling me
the reason why you are both here.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.840
-You go?
-Go first, Chiara.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.200
For me, having a relationship more...

00:51.880 --> 00:53.920
It depends too much on his moods,

00:54.000 --> 00:58.359
if he is in a good mood, he is nice,

00:58.439 --> 01:03.000
but if he's down,
it's hard to deal with him.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.239
It's difficult for me
because I am more consistent.

01:06.319 --> 01:09.719
I am rarely very angry or down.

01:09.799 --> 01:13.280
I think that sometimes
we do far too many things.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.760
I would like to have some time
to spend alone with her.

01:17.359 --> 01:20.120
While many times
we are surrounded by this...

01:20.719 --> 01:24.079
By this traveling circus of people
and we are always...

01:24.159 --> 01:28.039
-They're family, friends.
-Not just family. Her friends, not mine.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.920
-You haven't got many friends.
-I don't have any.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.400
I'd rather have other people around
so that when he wants to do his own thing,

01:36.479 --> 01:42.120
and he needs his own space, I don't have
to stay there all alone, like a fool.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.520
Okay. Then I'll throw something
on the table.

01:44.599 --> 01:46.280
-Wait.
-Wait. Follow me too.

01:46.359 --> 01:49.599
What is it that you don't like
about what she is saying?

01:49.680 --> 01:52.840
That when I have problems of my own,

01:52.920 --> 01:56.400
-I look for a solution on my own.
-Okay.

01:56.479 --> 02:00.239
I usually try not to burden others
with my problems.

02:00.319 --> 02:03.159
-They are a burden though, but...
-Instead, she...

02:03.239 --> 02:05.120
Let him finish talking, Chiara.

02:05.200 --> 02:10.759
She has this tendency to want to talk
at length and push me into talking

02:10.840 --> 02:12.439
when I really don't want to.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.000
And this only makes me clam up even more.

02:16.079 --> 02:19.240
I don't open up easily.

02:19.319 --> 02:20.599
No, but what happens?

02:20.719 --> 02:24.840
He is much more touchy and negative
than me in general about life,

02:24.879 --> 02:30.599
so spending a whole day at home with him
when he refuses to talk seems silly.

02:30.719 --> 02:33.599
I say, "Okay, what happened?
Let's talk about it."

02:33.719 --> 02:37.079
Sorry, it's difficult to talk about
a problem to someone

02:37.159 --> 02:39.159
who says those issues are pointless.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.159
-They aren't all pointless. No.
-You just said it.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.840
-You said we value them differently.
-They aren't all pointless.

02:45.879 --> 02:48.800
I'm touchy, I get angry about
meaningless things.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.840
So I should talk to you about issues
you think are pointless? Tell me that.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.680
Would you talk to someone
who thinks your issues are pointless?

02:59.599 --> 03:02.199
All together. A big family hug.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.319
Come on, honey.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.000
You are stressing me out.

03:06.439 --> 03:08.680
Chiara wrote that Fede is an asshole.

03:08.759 --> 03:11.199
Chiara thinks she is having contractions.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.719
Oh! Fuck!

03:15.199 --> 03:18.240
We are trying to do
a first Versace fitting.

03:18.319 --> 03:20.319
I wanted to have a chill Sanremo.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.039
-Like this?
-Come on, Luis!

03:32.479 --> 03:35.039
-I love you even more.
-You are beautiful.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.879
-To Leone and Vittoria!
-Yes, to Franco!

03:37.960 --> 03:39.280
-You sure?
-About what?

03:39.360 --> 03:41.759
-That she is mine?
-Can you imagine?

03:46.599 --> 03:49.960
Everything started
With a dog and a bow tie

03:50.039 --> 03:50.879
How about that?

03:50.960 --> 03:54.479
And now we're expanding
The family a bit more

03:54.560 --> 03:55.920
Like a yo-yo

03:56.079 --> 03:59.599
Because every time you kiss me
You knock me out

03:59.680 --> 04:02.800
So kiss me, stupid,
And the show begins

04:02.919 --> 04:04.439
The Ferragnez

04:09.960 --> 04:12.639
MILAN - DECEMBER 17TH, 2020

04:12.719 --> 04:15.680
-Are you ready, honey?
-I got socks in my hand.

04:17.439 --> 04:19.680
Okay, I'll go and get ready for Sanremo.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.120
What do you need to do?

04:21.199 --> 04:23.199
-I go down some stairs.
-That's it?

04:23.240 --> 04:25.319
Do they introduce you one by one?

04:25.439 --> 04:27.800
No, they call someone else
and I come down.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.319
What do you need to do?

04:29.360 --> 04:32.159
In Sanremo Giovani,
the young singers perform

04:32.240 --> 04:34.560
and then the older ones take the stage.

04:34.639 --> 04:37.720
They say, "Here are Fedez
and Francesca Michielin"?

04:37.800 --> 04:39.000
Something like that.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.800
-The photos thing makes me laugh.
-Which one?

04:41.879 --> 04:44.519
-That you have to pose...
-Holding the award?

04:44.600 --> 04:47.879
They take the picture of all of you today?
And I wonder...

04:47.920 --> 04:51.800
Don't you have to wear the same thing
that you will at Sanremo?

04:51.879 --> 04:54.040
I mean, you'll have a different look.

04:54.120 --> 04:59.600
Like with the Oscar, in the picture
you have the same look as when you won it.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.360
I don't think people really care
about our look.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.160
I don't think so, honey.

05:05.519 --> 05:08.800
-Okay, bye.
-Fuck, give me a real good bye.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.160
Say good bye, dear.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.680
Have you said it to Leo?

05:15.560 --> 05:16.879
I'll do it when I leave.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.560
-You got a bit of lipstick left.
-Thanks.

05:19.639 --> 05:21.600
-Break a leg!
-Thanks.

05:23.439 --> 05:24.240
Go ahead.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.680
Christmas holidays
are always special to us.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.480
We are leaving
with all my family for Como.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.480
Fede is going to Sanremo instead

05:32.560 --> 05:36.000
because he has to be physically there
for the music festival.

05:36.079 --> 05:36.920
Okay.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.240
He'll join us tomorrow.

05:38.399 --> 05:40.600
My favorite suitcase. Brilliant.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.879
A PIC WITH A SUITCASE, AFTER YEARS!

05:46.920 --> 05:48.959
Okay, just to keep a low profile.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.639
Meanwhile I leave with my sisters,
Leo and my brothers-in-law.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.199
Valentina and Luca
are a very funny couple,

05:56.199 --> 05:57.360
I adore them.

06:01.560 --> 06:05.079
Francesca and Ricky have been an item
for a very long time.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.040
They are very sweet and a great couple.

06:08.519 --> 06:09.800
Bye, everybody!

06:09.879 --> 06:14.399
To me, it's wonderful being able
to spend the holidays with so many people.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.839
-Hi, Stefano. Hi, Ale.
-Hi.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.120
Let's go, we are a bit late, guys.

06:20.199 --> 06:24.079
Usually, I don't get excited
about the holidays.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.279
I don't look forward to them...

06:27.560 --> 06:30.560
eagerly. So, I really...

06:30.720 --> 06:33.040
-For Leo!
-It's for Leo!

06:33.120 --> 06:38.199
Come here. Go, Mati, go, honey, go.
One, two, three. Go.

06:38.279 --> 06:39.639
Go, Mati, come on!

06:39.879 --> 06:45.840
Chiara really loves being with her family,
being all together, sharing experiences...

06:45.920 --> 06:47.920
Shall we fasten our belts?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.079
-Yes.
-Good.

06:49.159 --> 06:54.600
She can't wait for the chance
to gather all her family together.

06:54.759 --> 06:55.920
I...

06:58.439 --> 07:00.160
I can do without them.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.480
I don't care much about Christmas.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.360
I feel it tight. Fuck!

07:06.439 --> 07:10.000
But a few days ago, I had a cast done
to dress up as Santa Claus.

07:10.079 --> 07:12.160
Good. Let's start from plaster casts.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.680
I risked suffocating
so that I could surprise Leone.

07:15.759 --> 07:16.759
-Terrible.
-Okay.

07:16.879 --> 07:17.839
I am here, Fede.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.560
I hope I handled it like a man.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.879
No, to be honest I don't care about it.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.920
Come on, you made it.

07:29.439 --> 07:31.879
Never again, guys, what the fuck!

07:31.959 --> 07:33.879
This will last forever.

07:33.959 --> 07:35.680
Who the fuck cares? I mean...

07:35.759 --> 07:38.879
I hope that when we get back to Milan,
Leone will like it.

07:39.879 --> 07:43.680
WE ARE LEAVING
TOWN FOR THE WEEKEND

07:49.920 --> 07:52.840
Honey, are you ready to go to Lake Como?

07:55.240 --> 07:57.360
Did you remember everything?

07:57.439 --> 07:59.040
I have a feeling I didn't.

07:59.680 --> 08:04.360
I couldn't pack anymore because
we have been at home for months

08:04.439 --> 08:06.279
so I am not used to it anymore.

08:11.079 --> 08:15.399
The year 2020
has been difficult for everyone.

08:15.480 --> 08:20.040
In the tribulations of this moment
I have found,

08:20.120 --> 08:22.839
I should say, the inspiration to do more.

08:22.920 --> 08:28.839
For us, it has been a year of awareness,
in relation to how to put to good use

08:29.879 --> 08:32.399
what we have got.

08:32.759 --> 08:36.519
Thank you all, guys. We have reached
more than 42,000 donations.

08:36.600 --> 08:41.120
My wife corrected me. It's donations
from 93 countries all over the world.

08:41.200 --> 08:47.120
This year has brought Fede and myself
to express ourselves on so many things

08:47.200 --> 08:51.080
and to try and do something positive
for our community.

08:51.159 --> 08:54.519
Thanks to this spontaneous movement
which started from us,

08:54.639 --> 08:57.600
but that without the involvement
of all the people,

08:57.639 --> 08:59.519
we wouldn't be able to do much.

08:59.639 --> 09:04.639
Hi, guys. We are getting ready to go
and collect our Ambrogino d'Oro award.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.480
Beautiful!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.360
This is my look,

09:08.440 --> 09:12.279
including the electronic tag
that they have forgotten to take out.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.120
Chiara Ferragni and Fedez.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.000
Fede and Chiara! Chiara!

09:16.080 --> 09:17.600
NANA CIANA WATCHES
HER GRANDSON FEDEZ ON STREAM

09:17.759 --> 09:20.039
Ambrogino d'Oro award and Nana crying.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.320
I felt proud for us as a family.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.519
I think we can really build
important things that can last.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.759
With their ironic story
of a Milanese family in lockdown,

09:31.879 --> 09:36.200
they have shown the importance
of helping the most vulnerable,

09:36.279 --> 09:39.080
in line with the authentic
Ambrosian spirit.

09:39.159 --> 09:43.039
The ugliness of this year
has revealed many beautiful moments

09:43.200 --> 09:47.440
and many beautiful things to remember.

09:47.519 --> 09:51.639
You look and I'll know by the expression
on your face. I'll understand.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.879
No? Is it negative?

09:59.720 --> 10:01.879
-You are a mom!
-I'm a double mommy!

10:01.960 --> 10:03.639
You are a double mommy!

10:03.759 --> 10:06.480
Look how beautiful the lake is, honey.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.879
LAKE COMO

10:09.960 --> 10:11.519
Wow!

10:14.639 --> 10:16.480
How beautiful!

10:17.720 --> 10:19.159
Did you see?

10:19.879 --> 10:22.879
Did you see the rose window
with all the lights?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.080
Very beautiful!

10:26.080 --> 10:28.120
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

10:28.399 --> 10:31.720
-I'm Rosy, I'm the villa's housekeeper.
-Nice to meet you.

10:31.759 --> 10:34.000
See how pretty it is, honey?

10:34.080 --> 10:35.720
What would you like to see?

10:35.759 --> 10:39.240
-The horses!
-There are horses! Shall we go?

10:39.600 --> 10:44.000
Becoming a mom, you start to change
the way you see things and act.

10:44.159 --> 10:45.360
Everything okay?

10:45.440 --> 10:49.639
There are many beautiful things,
but you also start being scared, anxious.

10:49.759 --> 10:51.960
I suffered a bit from that, especially.

10:52.039 --> 10:54.639
I'm here, don't be scared. Okay.

10:54.759 --> 10:59.240
I also have the advantage
of having a wonderful little boy

10:59.320 --> 11:01.879
who makes my day much better.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.360
-My head is spinning.
-Your head is spinning?

11:07.639 --> 11:10.799
Don't be scared, I'm here. See?

11:13.360 --> 11:17.039
I also like the idea that I will have
a young lady to raise,

11:17.120 --> 11:22.159
passing on my values to her
and everything I feel is right for her.

11:23.679 --> 11:26.919
I'm getting through this pregnancy
better than with Leo's.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.159
I was becoming a dad for the first time.

11:29.240 --> 11:33.639
I had crises, didn't feel I was up to it,
instead now... I mean,

11:33.799 --> 11:36.639
I feel I'm up to it
and I am enjoying the moment.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.120
-What is that?
-What?

11:38.200 --> 11:39.440
The pink one.

11:39.519 --> 11:42.080
It is the top of the mountain
with the snow.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.519
No, I would start from me and Francesca.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.360
We need to communicate, the big comeback,
after so many years.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.360
Fedez and his PR prepare a statement
about his presence at the Sanremo Festival

11:51.519 --> 11:52.600
Yes?

11:52.679 --> 11:58.679
And the desire to go
and have an experience.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.320
I mean, at a time when
you're not allowed to perform on stage.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.639
Wow! Beautiful.

12:14.399 --> 12:15.840
Hi, Fede.

12:16.679 --> 12:18.039
Wow, guys.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.480
This house is a dream!

12:25.440 --> 12:29.159
-Okay, what do I need to do?
-A photo with Francesca downstairs.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.240
-Then change.
-Perfect.

12:32.039 --> 12:34.759
-Hi! Welcome!
-Honey, hi!

12:35.480 --> 12:39.440
-We can hug each other, guys.
-Oh, at last!

12:40.759 --> 12:44.799
We are a super sisterhood.
We have different characters.

12:44.879 --> 12:45.879
VALENTINA
CHIARA'S SISTER

12:45.960 --> 12:49.440
But we complete one another very well.

12:49.679 --> 12:52.320
We push each other to be the best
we can be.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.080
Where is Fede in all this?

12:56.159 --> 12:58.399
In Sanremo. He will join us tomorrow.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.240
This evening they're announcing
the contestants.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.879
-Oh, live?
-Live?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.759
-Shall we watch?
-At what time?

13:04.840 --> 13:06.799
-I don't know.
-Sweet!

13:08.080 --> 13:09.279
I think it's nice.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.960
Yes, but what size?
From how many years ago?

13:14.039 --> 13:16.159
-Oh, are they mine? Fuck.
-Yes.

13:16.799 --> 13:18.879
We got them specifically for this.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.440
Why do you keep putting on my socks.
I can do it myself.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.639
I'm a polite and professional person.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.159
When they are not filming me,
you can help me, otherwise no.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.320
Oh, okay.

13:32.879 --> 13:36.720
-It's a bit tight. It's a strange look.
-Great study!

13:37.759 --> 13:40.879
Ready for the six o'clock mass.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.360
Oh, I'm looking a little chubby, guys.
No, it's terrible.

13:44.559 --> 13:46.039
Oh, voilà!

13:46.120 --> 13:49.480
-How do I look? A classic look.
-Yes.

13:49.559 --> 13:51.840
Would you like the wine menu, sir?

13:52.480 --> 13:55.360
-Cheers, guys!
-To these beautiful days together.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.960
-Would you like a taste of Amarone?
-A Taste?

13:58.039 --> 13:59.480
No, I'm joking.

13:59.919 --> 14:01.759
Where is Francesca? And Bea?

14:02.440 --> 14:03.600
Here he is!

14:03.679 --> 14:06.440
How long have you been ready for?
How many hours?

14:06.519 --> 14:07.440
FRANCESCA MICHIELIN
SINGER

14:07.519 --> 14:10.120
-Many?
-I usually touch up everything again.

14:10.200 --> 14:14.039
I'm wearing a suit from last year
and it doesn't fit.

14:15.799 --> 14:17.639
I can't do anything.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.919
-Will you send a video to Daddy?
-Yes.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.600
-"Break a leg, Daddy."
-Say, "break a leg, Daddy."

14:22.679 --> 14:24.000
Break a leg, Daddy.

14:24.399 --> 14:27.000
-"I love you very much."
-I love you very much.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.799
Okay, send him a kiss. Well done!

14:32.519 --> 14:36.000
Fede and I are always together,
and in the important moments,

14:36.080 --> 14:39.639
we're there for one another,
supporting each other.

14:40.559 --> 14:44.480
I would have loved to be there
because I know he'll be anxious.

14:44.919 --> 14:46.000
Put this hand back.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.200
-The other in your pocket.
-It looks like it's on her butt.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.279
Okay, this way.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.919
Is it Saremo Giovani or Sanremo Giovani?

14:56.279 --> 14:58.440
Not saremo. Sanremo.

14:58.519 --> 15:01.360
-Right, Sanremo Giovani.
-What's Saremo Giovani?

15:01.440 --> 15:03.879
-How should I know?
-"We will be young"...

15:04.000 --> 15:05.159
"We will be young"...

15:09.879 --> 15:11.639
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

15:11.799 --> 15:13.799
-Vale, my sister...
-Yeah?

15:13.879 --> 15:19.399
...didn't know Sanremo Giovani,
she thought the show was called

15:19.480 --> 15:20.759
"We Will Be Young."

15:22.200 --> 15:24.600
What show is it, "We Will Be Young"?

15:24.679 --> 15:28.159
Now I have to go there and he will ask,

15:28.240 --> 15:31.799
"First time at the festival?"
And I'll have to answer, wait...

15:32.799 --> 15:36.080
"At a time when..." Wait.

15:36.679 --> 15:40.559
He'll say, "First time at the festival?"
And I'll have to answer...

15:40.639 --> 15:41.480
"Look..."

15:42.879 --> 15:45.240
-Wait, wait.
-Honey, are you drunk?

15:45.559 --> 15:50.000
Imagine if he says, "First time
at the Festival?" and I start laughing...

15:50.080 --> 15:53.919
-Say, "First time at the festival?"
-"First time at the festival?"

15:54.759 --> 15:57.360
Look, at a time when we can't...

15:57.919 --> 15:59.759
We can't...

15:59.960 --> 16:03.279
I don't remember what the fuck
I'm supposed to say. Wait.

16:03.360 --> 16:07.080
Sanremo doesn't represent only
the most important stage in Italy

16:07.159 --> 16:11.159
but at this moment and in this situation,
it is also the only stage.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.639
Super cool, honey.

16:15.879 --> 16:16.960
Very beautiful.

16:17.039 --> 16:20.639
Are you wearing a Bulgari necklace
at ten o'clock at night?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.840
Honey, we were having dinner.

16:22.919 --> 16:25.720
-You have dinner with a Bulgari necklace?
-Sure!

16:25.799 --> 16:29.559
This is not a real reality.
I mean, you usually... Say it.

16:29.639 --> 16:34.919
At home, of course not, but here it's like
being in a restaurant, all together here.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.559
-Okay, I have to go. You got on my nerves.
-Hey! No! Hey!

16:39.639 --> 16:42.200
-I love you, bye.
-Say it better.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.200
If you would have been here,
we would have had sex.

16:45.279 --> 16:46.399
Stop it!

16:47.279 --> 16:50.720
We have sex in the series as well,
because after the series,

16:51.639 --> 16:54.399
-we can release the sex tape.
-Honey, stop.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.320
-What an idiot. Break a leg!
-Thanks, bye.

16:58.399 --> 17:00.799
-Later. Bye, honey.
-Bye.

17:02.879 --> 17:03.840
He's nuts.

17:05.400 --> 17:10.200
Okay, come on! We are late, aren't we?

17:12.319 --> 17:13.799
Ask me the question.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.640
Is it your first time in Sanremo?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.799
Look... Amadeus,

17:18.920 --> 17:22.920
in a year when we have had
no opportunities to perform live,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Sanremo doesn't only represent...

17:33.640 --> 17:36.640
An incredible evening.
I hope you are enjoying it.

17:37.319 --> 17:41.319
-Twenty-six champions competing...
-Can I sit with you?

17:41.440 --> 17:43.799
...with this incredible couple.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.799
She is a young singer songwriter.

17:46.920 --> 17:51.799
He is a rapper, producer, entrepreneur,

17:51.880 --> 17:57.559
at the center of important
charity campaigns together with his wife.

17:57.680 --> 18:02.559
Here in Sanremo,
Francesca Michielin and Fedez!

18:05.319 --> 18:08.160
Let's see if he remembers that sentence.

18:08.559 --> 18:12.559
Welcome to Sanremo!
Francesca Michielin and Fedez.

18:12.640 --> 18:16.319
-Don't they get the mic?
-And the song you will sing?

18:16.440 --> 18:19.680
Shall we say it together?
Go ahead. Three, two, one...

18:19.759 --> 18:22.680
"Call Me by My Name."

18:22.759 --> 18:23.799
And the sentence?

18:23.880 --> 18:28.240
We will listen to Francesca Michielin
and Fedez in Sanremo.

18:28.319 --> 18:30.200
-We have waited for an hour.
-Thanks.

18:30.279 --> 18:32.079
We waited an hour.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.640
No, over an hour. One hour and a half.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.799
They didn't give him the microphone.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.400
-Do I go up this way?
-Cool, wasn't it?

18:43.480 --> 18:45.799
Saw the big sentence I had prepared?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.920
LAKE COMO - DECEMBER 18TH, 2020

18:57.680 --> 18:59.480
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

18:59.559 --> 19:01.920
Today, yoga lesson with my sisters.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.799
-Hi!
-There's mommy.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.559
Let's see how it goes.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.079
-It's an honor.
-Thanks.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.279
Good morning.

19:08.319 --> 19:12.000
The kundalini yoga lessons
have a particular routine,

19:12.079 --> 19:16.319
we start reciting a mantra
and we finish reciting another mantra.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.079
I'm not very yoga friendly.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.400
Exhale and relax.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.400
I would like to learn to do it better,
but it's not really 100% my thing.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.759
Let's start now. I say, "Om..."
And you, "Om..."

19:38.400 --> 19:40.079
-It's Francesca!
-Splendid.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.759
It came out a bit nasal.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.400
It came out...

19:51.720 --> 19:53.799
SANREMO - DECEMBER 18TH, 2020

19:54.720 --> 19:58.920
It's official. You are on the festival
stage, a new target for you.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.079
It's a new experience. Sure is.
And certainly, a new target.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.319
What are you expecting?

20:04.519 --> 20:06.559
I have no expectations, it is nice

20:06.640 --> 20:09.480
because whatever happens
it will be something new.

20:09.559 --> 20:10.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:11.319 --> 20:13.480
SANREMO CASINO
FEDEZ AND FRANCESCA MICHIELIN SHOOTING

20:13.559 --> 20:14.799
-Good morning.
-Hi.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.799
-Good morning.
-Hello.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.240
-Hi, beautiful. What's up?
-How are you?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.319
-Good?
-Good.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.440
You look good.

20:21.519 --> 20:22.720
ARISA
SINGER

20:22.880 --> 20:25.240
-I'm out of breath.
-We...

20:26.000 --> 20:29.440
-I wish you the best.
-Thank you.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.160
-Big hug. Enjoy your holidays.
-Thank you.

20:32.559 --> 20:34.759
-Bye, yes.
-Bye.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.720
I have a booger in my nose.

20:38.799 --> 20:42.279
I think it's a scab because
while trying to get rid of it,

20:42.319 --> 20:44.440
I hurt my nose.

20:44.519 --> 20:47.759
I go on trying to get rid of it,
but it is not a booger.

20:47.799 --> 20:49.640
-Does it grow back?
-Yes, it hurts.

20:49.720 --> 20:50.640
STEFANO CLESSI
MANAGER - MUSICAL EDITOR

20:50.720 --> 20:53.400
We have to find a solution.
Who should we call?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.079
An expert in nostrils.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.799
Of boogerology?
With the expert in numerology?

20:57.920 --> 21:00.160
Yesterday we called the numerology expert.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.720
-The...
-Don't you know about this?

21:02.799 --> 21:04.319
A numerologist?

21:05.079 --> 21:08.519
-Well, since... Since I...
-Working together.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.680
Since we started working together...

21:10.759 --> 21:12.720
For fear of doing any damage...

21:12.799 --> 21:16.480
Every release date has been chosen
by the numerologist.

21:17.559 --> 21:20.200
-Are you joking?
-Do not diminish our work.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.799
-He supported it.
-Yes, and at one point...

21:22.960 --> 21:25.480
-Is he some kind of a magician?
-He is.

21:25.559 --> 21:28.920
A friend of mine who is basically
an expert in numerology.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.440
Later, I will call him for a consultation.

21:31.519 --> 21:35.319
Ask him what to do.
I believe in these kinds of things.

21:36.079 --> 21:38.440
Let's see how the evenings will go.

21:38.519 --> 21:39.920
Go, okay.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.799
-Tell me one, two, or three.
-Three.

21:42.279 --> 21:44.559
-Another one.
-Seven.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.759
The evenings are going very well.

21:49.799 --> 21:54.000
And maybe your guardian angel
will show himself again above you.

21:56.279 --> 21:59.240
-I'm feeling a bit hungry now.
-Mother of God!

21:59.319 --> 22:01.039
But I ate like a pig.

22:01.119 --> 22:03.799
I don't want to eat until this evening.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.720
You are always hungry when pregnant.

22:05.799 --> 22:07.880
I'm not pregnant and I'm hungry.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.279
-After eating you feel heavier right away.
-What will I do when I'm pregnant?

22:12.359 --> 22:13.640
I'm always hungry.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.079
-How much weight have you gained so far?
-Seven kilos.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.079
Not much.

22:18.160 --> 22:23.160
It's enough for seven months. But I think
I will get to 15, like with Leo.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.880
What a dream!

22:24.960 --> 22:29.680
I love Leone,
but the idea of a little girl now...

22:29.759 --> 22:30.680
FRANCESCA
CHIARA'S SISTER

22:30.759 --> 22:33.880
I love it and I can't wait to see her.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.880
Hello, family, I'm home.

22:38.799 --> 22:41.519
-Speech!
-Wanna see the house?

22:41.599 --> 22:43.400
-Welcome, Fede.
-Yes.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.680
I want to take a shit in a place
where I can sit on my ass.

22:46.759 --> 22:50.000
-Do you have the microphone?
-So?

22:50.079 --> 22:51.559
They will switch it off.

22:51.640 --> 22:56.000
In Sanremo, I have to shit standing,
like at the service station.

22:56.079 --> 22:58.839
-Yuck! Come on, please!
-I want to sit to shit.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.359
There are Turkish toilets.

23:00.440 --> 23:04.599
Fede sometimes says horrendous things

23:04.680 --> 23:09.240
I try to remind him
of you guys watching us,

23:09.359 --> 23:10.920
but I can only do so much.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.160
Shall we have a look, honey?

23:14.240 --> 23:15.480
Come, look.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.559
-Ready, steady... Go!
-Go!

23:18.640 --> 23:20.119
Let's go!

23:20.880 --> 23:23.680
-Let's go!
-Where is it?

23:23.759 --> 23:26.160
-Leo!
-Oh, look, come and see.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.160
Everything lights up.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.400
Ready, steady, go!

23:35.960 --> 23:37.680
How lovely!

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
-We have a surprise. Shall we go and see?
-Surprise!

23:42.640 --> 23:43.480
Go.

23:43.559 --> 23:45.920
-Look at those big reindeers!
-Go faster.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.839
Go. Look how beautiful

23:50.920 --> 23:52.599
How beautiful!

23:52.680 --> 23:56.799
-Hold my hand, honey.
-What are we doing here?

23:57.640 --> 24:00.400
The first love, the first mistake
The first sun...

24:00.480 --> 24:02.440
A skating rink?

24:02.880 --> 24:04.960
Daddy's a very good skater, you know?

24:05.039 --> 24:07.000
How lovely, Leo!

24:08.440 --> 24:10.440
Don't hurt yourselves, sisters.

24:11.119 --> 24:13.240
Look, ever seen auntie
in physical therapy?

24:14.480 --> 24:17.319
Okay. Go with Daddy, honey, because...

24:17.400 --> 24:19.519
Only with Daddy.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.680
-Only with Daddy.
-Mommy can't do it because of the baby.

24:23.759 --> 24:25.680
-Voilà.
-Done. Vo-la-la.

24:26.119 --> 24:27.880
-Vo-la-la.
-Vo-la-la!

24:28.759 --> 24:30.519
You are my big potato.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.400
No, I'm so scared.

24:32.480 --> 24:37.160
-The worst that can happen is you falling.
-The 2026 Olympics are not far.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.200
Come on. You can walk.

24:39.839 --> 24:40.799
Can you manage?

24:41.720 --> 24:44.559
-Well done, like a ballerina.
-He's wearing heels.

24:44.720 --> 24:45.920
Well done.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.920
I have never questioned myself on the type
of educational model we use with my son.

24:51.519 --> 24:53.559
I don't know, everyone... I don't know.

24:53.640 --> 24:54.480
Okay.

24:54.599 --> 24:56.759
I think we have a common line.

24:57.079 --> 24:59.799
But if he does it when young...

25:00.559 --> 25:04.440
You can see that he is a happy child.

25:06.480 --> 25:10.480
The best thing is to create
as many opportunities as possible for him.

25:10.559 --> 25:11.680
Go, honey!

25:11.759 --> 25:15.000
And not have expectations
about what he will want to do.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.200
Hold on tight.

25:18.039 --> 25:21.160
-Hi, Mommy!
-Hi, honey!

25:22.680 --> 25:24.839
Come here, Daddy.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.759
-Come here, Daddy, Leo!
-Wait, shit.

25:27.839 --> 25:30.079
-Steady... Go!
-Go!

25:30.680 --> 25:33.279
When Leo will be a grown up,
I have no idea.

25:33.359 --> 25:36.880
He is very expressive, so we joke,
"He will become an actor."

25:36.960 --> 25:39.519
You are a ballerina, honey.

25:39.599 --> 25:43.799
But I hope he will find his way
and I hope he will feel free

25:43.880 --> 25:47.640
to follow his heart
and do whatever he likes the most.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.200
-Let's go.
-Did you enjoy yourself, honey?

25:50.279 --> 25:52.240
I had fun with Daddy.

25:52.839 --> 25:54.680
-Oh, well done.
-What, honey?

25:55.039 --> 25:57.480
I had fun with Daddy.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.799
You had fun with Daddy.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.240
And then he goes.
Don't you say bye? Thanks.

26:03.319 --> 26:06.279
-You leave just like that?
-You little monkey!

26:06.359 --> 26:08.039
Little monkey!

26:08.519 --> 26:09.880
Are you tired?

26:09.960 --> 26:13.160
Ale will be here soon
and she will take care of him.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.400
-You are a bit of a little monkey too.
-Why?

26:17.599 --> 26:18.880
What have I done?

26:20.240 --> 26:24.119
You look beautiful.
Have you seen how smart I am?

26:24.200 --> 26:27.440
-You never pay me a compliment.
-I said you look beautiful.

26:27.519 --> 26:28.599
Why complain?

26:28.680 --> 26:31.079
I said it and you say that I don't say it.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.519
Until then you didn't.

26:32.599 --> 26:35.160
-But I said it now.
-I want some sweetness.

26:35.240 --> 26:38.240
Desserts are waiting in the library.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.720
Where is the library?

26:39.799 --> 26:42.000
It's the door behind you, on the left.

26:42.079 --> 26:44.559
Strange they didn't ask what a library is.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.559
Upstairs? Okay. Thanks.

26:47.799 --> 26:50.359
Bye, honey. Good night.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.000
Bye, Lellito.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.720
Bye, Lellito.

26:57.359 --> 26:59.240
Mother of God, I'm dead, honey.

26:59.799 --> 27:01.880
Honey, you haven't done shit today.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.799
Can you stop being an asshole?

27:03.880 --> 27:05.960
-I'm joking.
-Stop it, fuck!

27:06.119 --> 27:09.039
I'm seven months pregnant
and I haven't done shit?

27:09.720 --> 27:13.039
By nature I just

27:13.119 --> 27:17.599
get really angry only when it's something
I think is really serious,

27:17.680 --> 27:20.000
otherwise I try and be calmer.

27:20.119 --> 27:23.839
And knowing him,
I think that if I attacked him as well,

27:23.920 --> 27:25.599
it would be ten times worse.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.279
-It would escalate.
-It doesn't come natural,

27:28.359 --> 27:30.319
but it also doesn't have an answer.

27:30.400 --> 27:34.640
Do you understand that when he attacks,
the truth is that he is hurt?

27:35.839 --> 27:38.680
-Yes, maybe. Yes.
-You are not sure?

27:38.880 --> 27:41.559
Sometimes I understand it,
sometimes I don't.

27:41.720 --> 27:46.920
Sometimes he seems a bit
of an asshole with his words.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.440
While from my point of view,
I always try and find a solution.

27:51.519 --> 27:54.359
Because to me it's important
to find a solution.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.759
When he is fine, all the people
around him are fine too...

27:57.839 --> 28:00.240
So he has a big impact on all the family?

28:00.319 --> 28:02.720
On me for sure. So...

28:02.799 --> 28:05.240
Stop for a second, and tell him clearly.

28:05.319 --> 28:08.000
When you shut yourself away, I feel...

28:08.079 --> 28:10.279
-I feel...
-No, tell him.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.720
-Now he is a little bit withdrawn.
-I tell you, don't I?

28:13.799 --> 28:17.480
When you don't talk to me,
it's the worst thing you can do to me.

28:17.559 --> 28:19.599
How do you feel in that moment?

28:19.680 --> 28:22.680
I feel excluded from his life and useless.

28:22.759 --> 28:26.160
Okay, stop for a minute.
Do you see her? Look at her tears.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.920
No, it's like this.
She is telling you something important.

28:31.039 --> 28:34.559
It's small each time, but multiplying it,

28:34.640 --> 28:37.480
it makes your relationship too intense.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.119
There's tissues under there,

28:40.200 --> 28:43.559
-people often cry at the shrink.
-It is such a cliché.

28:45.119 --> 28:47.720
If you don't judge that crying,

28:47.799 --> 28:50.480
-what do you feel seeing her cry?
-I feel bad.

28:51.119 --> 28:55.680
Okay, do her exercise.
Look at her in the eyes and tell her?

28:56.880 --> 29:01.440
When I'm hurting,
I don't want to hurt you too.

29:01.880 --> 29:05.799
It's that I'm hurting a lot
and I need to be alone.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.640
-No, you missed the central piece.
-Which one?

29:08.799 --> 29:12.079
"I'm sorry that while I'm hurting
it makes you feel hurt."

29:12.240 --> 29:16.200
I'm sorry that while I'm hurting
it makes you feel hurt as well.

29:17.279 --> 29:21.519
Okay. I understand.
I mean, I understand part of it.

29:25.119 --> 29:28.079
-Let me feel Vittoria.
-You didn't cuddle with me.

29:28.160 --> 29:31.640
But I'm doing it now.
You complain when I do things.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.279
Let me feel Vittoria. Get comfortable...

29:35.359 --> 29:36.960
I'm comfortable this way.

29:37.039 --> 29:39.319
-Come on.
-So...

29:39.559 --> 29:41.640
-Women against men.
-Let's not play.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.680
-No. We are playing.
-I need a nap.

29:43.759 --> 29:45.279
No, honey, we gotta play.

29:45.359 --> 29:47.079
A Christmas nap.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.519
Taboo really is the best family game.

29:50.599 --> 29:54.079
When we miss each other,
but we can't meet, what do we do?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.400
-Call.
-Celebrate.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.880
-Verb? Good.
-To call.

29:57.039 --> 29:59.960
When there are people
who throw themselves...

30:00.039 --> 30:01.039
-Suicide.
-No.

30:01.119 --> 30:04.279
There are stories,
from a couple of years back,

30:04.359 --> 30:07.200
in which Vale and Fede have excelled.

30:07.359 --> 30:09.599
That's why we want to do it every year.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.799
Marilyn would put five drops
of Chanel and it was a...

30:13.039 --> 30:14.759
-Perfume.
-Then...

30:15.279 --> 30:17.240
-Mussolini was a...
-Dictator.

30:17.319 --> 30:19.319
-Synonym?
-Despot?

30:19.400 --> 30:21.480
-Another one?
-Tyrant!

30:21.839 --> 30:24.640
-You can't do these things!
-To kill the...

30:24.720 --> 30:25.839
Time!

30:25.960 --> 30:28.559
-If you do a bad concert they throw a...
-Stop!

30:28.640 --> 30:29.880
-Tomato.
-Awesome.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.960
Shit, Fede is... Is great!

30:35.079 --> 30:36.000
We're great!

30:36.079 --> 30:38.400
Yes, have to get your act together.

30:38.480 --> 30:41.319
When he's in a good mood, he's great.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.599
It gets everybody involved.

30:44.759 --> 30:46.799
-It's fantastic.
-One, two, three...

30:46.880 --> 30:50.400
You are a rapper. You are good
at talking and communicating.

30:50.480 --> 30:52.640
One, two, three...

30:53.359 --> 30:55.799
Because we don't bother you, it's that...

30:57.799 --> 30:59.400
Shall we go look upstairs?

30:59.480 --> 31:02.119
No, let's go downstairs
or they will complain.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.839
We have been on Lake Como
for a couple of days.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.039
Today, the grandparents are joining us.

31:07.119 --> 31:08.279
Well done!

31:08.359 --> 31:10.559
Fede's parents are coming.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.839
The legendary Franco and Tatiana,
also known as Tati,

31:13.920 --> 31:15.599
who works with Fede as well.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.079
It's Tatiana and Franco.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.440
Is it my father's car?

31:20.519 --> 31:22.599
Yes. You didn't know, honey?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.920
What kind of car has he bought?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.720
You didn't know? Actually...

31:27.160 --> 31:29.400
-Hi!
-Hi, honey!

31:29.480 --> 31:30.359
Hi!

31:30.440 --> 31:34.079
My in-laws are very nice.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.000
Obviously from time to time

31:36.160 --> 31:41.279
they irritate you, but 90% of the time
they are super nice.

31:41.359 --> 31:42.279
Hi.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.440
Have you had breakfast?

31:45.519 --> 31:46.720
No, a while ago.

31:46.799 --> 31:49.000
We are different from Chiara's family.

31:49.079 --> 31:54.319
Her family shows love in a physical way.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.119
-Hi, Tatiana.
-Hi.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.240
-How's the belly?
-Good.

31:58.319 --> 32:01.319
Less visibly affectionate.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.839
Maybe, we are a bit more cold as well.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.480
So, how are things?

32:09.640 --> 32:10.480
Good.

32:10.559 --> 32:12.119
My parents are coming too.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.839
My mother Marina, who is a writer,

32:14.920 --> 32:17.160
and my father Marco, who is a dentist.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.400
MARCO
CHIARA'S FATHER

32:19.559 --> 32:21.839
-Hi!
-Hi!

32:21.920 --> 32:23.400
-Hi!
-Oh, beautiful.

32:23.599 --> 32:26.359
-Hello, honeys.
-How are you?

32:26.440 --> 32:27.400
Hello, honey.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.440
Hi, wonderful Francesca. Hello, Luca!

32:30.640 --> 32:31.920
Daddy!

32:32.160 --> 32:33.240
-Welcome.
-Hi.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.359
-Have you seen how beautiful the house is?
-Gorgeous.

32:36.440 --> 32:37.519
It's my house.

32:38.119 --> 32:39.640
It's our new house.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.599
I told you I bought it.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.440
How are things? Are you hungry?

32:43.519 --> 32:46.640
-I'll show you.
-I haven't seen you for more than a month.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.440
But not even us!

32:49.440 --> 32:51.240
They are only interested in me.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.279
-Hello, big Daddy.
-Hi, sorry.

32:53.359 --> 32:59.119
In Chiara's family they are more outgoing,
they hug each other three times a day.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.079
How are you?

33:00.240 --> 33:03.559
If I see Fede today and tomorrow
I just say, "Hello."

33:03.640 --> 33:05.480
Hey!

33:06.160 --> 33:07.680
Fede, good morning.

33:07.759 --> 33:10.160
-Good morning.
-Hi, good morning.

33:10.240 --> 33:13.480
Greet them properly.
You haven't seen them in a while.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.440
A hug.

33:14.519 --> 33:17.440
I don't hug my parents,
let alone my mother-in-law.

33:17.519 --> 33:19.400
I find it embarrassing.

33:19.559 --> 33:20.480
Thanks.

33:21.079 --> 33:21.920
A lot.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.960
-Shall we go and eat?
-Shall we?

33:24.039 --> 33:30.039
Federico is more sensitive
and less aggressive than he lets on.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.440
What can you do? He is like that.

33:34.079 --> 33:36.000
-Guys, cheers!
-Cheers all!

33:36.079 --> 33:38.160
-To us!
-To this beautiful reunion.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.640
You can serve, Marina.

33:40.839 --> 33:42.359
I would like the octopus.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.599
Very good.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.640
The scallops are very good.

33:46.839 --> 33:50.279
The reunion with my girls has been nice
and satisfying.

33:50.359 --> 33:51.359
MARCO
CHIARA'S FATHER

33:51.440 --> 33:54.559
I hadn't see them for two months.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.519
Fede, you saw the car for the first time?

33:59.599 --> 34:01.799
-No, I saw it before.
-Do you like it?

34:01.880 --> 34:03.640
-It's a bit tacky.
-Tacky?

34:03.720 --> 34:04.839
Look who's talking.

34:06.519 --> 34:07.599
If you say so.

34:07.680 --> 34:11.800
Celebrations are an opportunity
to distance myself from everything.

34:11.960 --> 34:15.480
Being just with my wife
and my son would be the best

34:15.559 --> 34:18.559
because I don't get to be
with them that much.

34:18.760 --> 34:21.960
As you can see, we are so many,
which is lovely,

34:23.599 --> 34:25.800
But it is also... noisy.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.800
-Franco looks younger.
-Thank you.

34:28.880 --> 34:32.159
Your face seems like it's smoother.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.079
-Yes?
-Maybe ten years younger.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.599
Go check your eyesight!

34:36.440 --> 34:40.599
If I had to give a title to the love story
between Chiara and Federico,

34:40.639 --> 34:42.679
it's "A Happy Meeting of Two Opposites."

34:42.800 --> 34:44.480
-Hi, Honey.
-Hi, Baby.

34:44.559 --> 34:46.840
How beautiful are you?

34:46.920 --> 34:49.480
This Christmas weekend has been wonderful.

34:49.559 --> 34:50.559
VALENTINA
CHIARA'S SISTER

34:50.639 --> 34:53.840
Getting together with the whole family,

34:54.000 --> 34:57.159
seeing Leo so excited about everything,

34:57.280 --> 34:59.400
I'm very happy.

34:59.599 --> 35:01.639
-That's great!
-It's snowing!

35:01.679 --> 35:03.199
Is the snow beautiful?

35:04.159 --> 35:07.400
Oh, yes, you can eat the snow.

35:10.840 --> 35:11.800
Beautiful!

35:11.880 --> 35:12.880
The snow!

35:12.960 --> 35:14.960
-It's snowing!
-How lovely, Leo!

35:15.039 --> 35:17.000
Let's go and see, come here!

35:17.079 --> 35:19.800
The surprises on Lake Como
have all worked out.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.840
So beautiful!

35:21.920 --> 35:24.440
The snow was beautiful and Leo loved it.

35:24.559 --> 35:27.800
Franco, come and do it with me.
I haven't got a partner!

35:27.880 --> 35:31.880
Fede thinks it was a bit exaggerated,
but it's okay.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.760
Shaving cream falling out of the sky.
Too much.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.320
Come on, honey! The snow!

35:37.400 --> 35:40.440
It's the tackiest thing
I have ever seen in my life.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.880
It has been a wonderful weekend.
A lovely Christmas present.

35:48.960 --> 35:49.800
MILAN - DECEMBER 20TH, 2020

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
Perfect, I will get ready with Leo here.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.480
-Bye.
-Bye.

35:53.559 --> 35:55.840
Honey, your guest is arriving.

35:56.519 --> 35:58.159
Where are you taking Gianni?

35:58.280 --> 36:01.320
The airport was that way,
the aircraft was that way.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.000
I'm turning into Santa Claus
as a surprise to Leone.

36:07.639 --> 36:10.320
Doing something like this,
you have two ways.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.880
-Everything good?
-Yes, so far.

36:13.320 --> 36:19.159
Start a chat about the make-up world,
trying to analyze the topic...

36:19.280 --> 36:21.559
But will I look like Santa Claus?

36:21.639 --> 36:24.000
-With the beard and the wig, yes.
-Okay.

36:24.079 --> 36:28.920
-Without?
-You'll look like a fat, old man.

36:29.000 --> 36:29.840
Okay.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.679
Or spend hours of hell
putting makeup on complaining.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.960
It's in my nose.

36:35.039 --> 36:37.280
I think I have chosen the second option.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.000
What a pain in the ass.

36:44.159 --> 36:47.639
I don't look like Santa Claus.
I look like a sausage.

36:47.679 --> 36:49.159
No, I hate it!

36:50.639 --> 36:52.880
Ho ho ho, sons of a bitches!

36:58.039 --> 37:00.159
-Who is it, Mommy?
-Who do you think?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.920
So exciting, honey!

37:04.679 --> 37:06.039
Are you excited?

37:06.159 --> 37:07.599
-Yes.
-Yes?

37:07.800 --> 37:08.760
Yes!

37:11.440 --> 37:12.639
Hello, Leone!

37:14.119 --> 37:16.559
I'm Santa Claus! How are you?

37:16.679 --> 37:17.559
Daddy.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.480
-No...
-Take it off, Daddy.

37:20.559 --> 37:22.400
I'm Santa Claus, honey!

37:22.480 --> 37:23.840
It's not true, Daddy!

37:25.440 --> 37:27.880
It's not Daddy, honey. It's Santa Claus!

37:27.960 --> 37:28.960
Daddy!

37:29.039 --> 37:31.320
Honey, I'm Santa Claus!

37:31.519 --> 37:33.920
I brought you a present. Wanna see it?

37:34.280 --> 37:35.960
-Daddy!
-It's not Daddy.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.440
-It's not Daddy.
-Daddy

37:37.519 --> 37:40.639
Pretend, it took me eight hours
to put the make-up on.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.639
-Take it off!
-Come on, honey!

37:42.760 --> 37:44.639
I got busted what shall I do?

37:44.679 --> 37:48.920
-Couldn't you make a voice a bit more...
-When I speak to him, I do it.

37:49.880 --> 37:50.679
Awesome.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.480
Eight hours in make-up.

37:54.760 --> 37:56.000
Take it off, Daddy!

37:56.079 --> 37:57.880
Okay, come to get a pic, come.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.760
You look really weird.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.159
-No, come on.
-It is really funny though.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.559
You are so heavy, honey!

38:15.480 --> 38:17.480
No, honey, not like this... Ouch!

38:28.400 --> 38:30.639
-Honey!
-Honey!

38:36.159 --> 38:40.119
That child rocks, guys.
He has just beaten up Santa Claus.

38:40.840 --> 38:41.639
Honey!

38:42.519 --> 38:44.840
-That's making your dad very proud.
-Leo!

38:44.920 --> 38:48.920
Beating up old strangers who come
into your house to kiss your mom.

38:51.639 --> 38:52.679
Counselor.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.679
Unfortunately, I live in a warzone.

38:56.119 --> 38:57.480
Discipline him, though.

38:57.559 --> 38:59.880
-Look at her!
-I can't see anything.

39:05.119 --> 39:09.440
Our aim in this session
is to understand if your differences

39:09.519 --> 39:13.440
constitute a resource
or an obstacle for your relationship.
