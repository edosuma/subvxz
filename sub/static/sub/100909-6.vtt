00:09.850 --> 00:11.850
My mind does not find peace.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.370
He is looking for a
way out of the darkness.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.880
I think of the roads I could choose.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.980
About the signs that I did not see.

00:26.990 --> 00:29.250
Before me is a myriad of roads.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.759
But they all lead me

00:33.850 --> 00:35.850
in the same place.

01:55.410 --> 01:57.410
Good morning. Good morning.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.470
Do you know what
people cook in the kitchen?

02:02.550 --> 02:05.060
Well, yes, I read about it somewhere.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.780
Where's the coffee? He is there.

02:22.380 --> 02:24.950
If I were you, I wouldn't risk it.

02:27.650 --> 02:29.650
Still alive. Okay.

02:40.460 --> 02:44.490
You was right. Dominic's
lawyer pulled Carrie out of prison.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.440
How do you know? He himself admitted.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.340
He said he wanted to protect me.

02:50.510 --> 02:52.510
And do you believe him?

02:53.930 --> 02:55.930
Did he kill Edward?

03:06.040 --> 03:08.060
Be careful.

03:08.140 --> 03:11.360
If he was following you,
he could find out that you are here.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.710
I did not follow. Are you sure?

03:18.540 --> 03:21.650
What will you do?
Papers with Ed notes.

03:22.340 --> 03:24.620
I need them. They
were taken by the police.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.720
I know, but the only way I
understand why they killed Ed.

03:38.690 --> 03:41.240
I have to go. Good.

03:45.170 --> 03:49.160
Today at one o’clock in the morning,
UBS contacted the City of London police.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.130
Kveku Adoboli was
arrested this morning.

03:52.220 --> 03:55.930
City lacked only the
trader’s accusations of fraud.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.130
He would like to stay in the old school.
His old school is a dangerous place.

04:36.260 --> 04:38.360
And his new one is damn expensive.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.440
Why money if you don’t spend it, Toy?

04:40.540 --> 04:42.760
You have been
spending too much lately.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.120
What could be more
important than bros?

04:46.600 --> 04:48.970
I love you, Oliver Harris. Yes?

04:50.630 --> 04:52.780
I still like you too. Yes?

04:53.080 --> 04:55.310
Wait a minute,
I'll replenish the card.

05:08.530 --> 05:10.530
Good morning sir.

05:11.910 --> 05:13.910
Is everything okay?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Yes.

05:18.010 --> 05:20.010
Come on.

06:00.730 --> 06:03.550
Hey! Look here! Here! Just one photo!

06:32.460 --> 06:35.700
Something happened to
my pass. Come with me.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.590
And what? Something
is wrong? Come with me.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.960
So what's going on?
Wait with the rest.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.250
Did you see the news in the morning?

07:07.330 --> 07:09.556
Someone from UBS was arrested
for concealing risky transactions.

07:09.580 --> 07:11.980
Yes, we have seen. We did the same!

07:18.380 --> 07:20.490
Relax. Sooner or
later we will find out.

07:20.580 --> 07:22.780
Well yes, relax. You will get fired.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.860
But I changed VAR.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.800
They can arrest me!
And show in the news!

07:28.880 --> 07:30.880
You are too small a bipod for news.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.930
They will uplift Massimo in public,
and we will hang out next.

07:48.890 --> 07:50.890
Has anyone understood why we are here?

07:51.320 --> 07:54.080
We faked VAR. I knew you were smart,
Oliver.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.930
But how did they
find out? It was a trap.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.440
And you fell into it.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.840
And who arranged it?

08:05.450 --> 08:07.450
You four go with me.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.860
What the hell are you here for?

08:22.950 --> 08:26.490
Chris will soon be my deputy.

08:27.260 --> 08:29.760
Congratulations. Thanks, Eleanor.

08:30.270 --> 08:32.270
Paul McGinan will lead
the trading department.

08:32.409 --> 08:35.630
Massimo is his boss! And
Paul doesn’t even work here!

08:35.720 --> 08:38.780
Paul was taken back.
Massimo was the boss.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.250
From this moment he
is an ordinary trader.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.690
Have questions? Yes.

08:45.030 --> 08:47.030
What the hell?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.400
Kalim wanted to say

08:49.770 --> 08:52.850
that Paul is a good trader,
but he cannot compare with Massimo.

08:52.940 --> 08:55.380
No one compares. You heard Mr. Morgan.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.510
So they don’t fire us?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.860
Not yet, but the day has just begun.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.240
You will not leave us?

09:09.400 --> 09:12.450
Why didn't you fire me?
So you crap loot elsewhere?

09:12.710 --> 09:16.840
You think I won’t leave myself?
If you leave, I will condemn you.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.640
It's not my fault.
Your team is guilty.

09:22.590 --> 09:24.810
Why are you doing this? What for?

09:24.890 --> 09:27.950
You left me no choice! Threw
one fortress after another.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.396
Did you really think that I
would close my eyes to...

09:32.420 --> 09:35.230
I’m not your boy. You will
go and earn me money.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.620
In time,
you will return your position.

10:25.470 --> 10:27.630
Nick? Hi Sofia.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.890
Similar crimes can be repeated,

10:29.970 --> 10:32.650
since bankers are
forced to make a profit...

10:32.740 --> 10:35.920
How bad is the situation
in European markets?

10:36.460 --> 10:38.820
Perhaps we are witnessing
the beginning of a new crisis?

10:43.880 --> 10:45.880
Hi Sol, where is he?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.390
The future of the next generation.

10:50.540 --> 10:54.430
This story is with UBS on all
channels! You did a great job.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.420
Apparently, like you.

11:00.210 --> 11:02.210
Turn off the recording.

11:02.380 --> 11:05.290
Your dedication
delights... So shut up!

11:05.520 --> 11:08.960
Turn off the computer when
doing something similar!

11:09.210 --> 11:11.210
Do not you know!

11:14.790 --> 11:16.790
And now what?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.770
Apparently,
our Italian friend finally trusts you.

11:19.870 --> 11:23.260
I think yes. So it's time
to devote it to business.

11:23.470 --> 11:26.320
Yes, but first he needs
to be given what he asks.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.610
I... I did not want
to take your place.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.910
Only in this way could I return.
I need a job. You fired me.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.060
Well, good luck, Paul.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.140
I know I'm not as good as you.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.430
Everyone knows that.

12:01.530 --> 12:04.450
I have to say something. No,
give him time.

12:06.060 --> 12:08.060
Oliver!

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
What?

12:15.080 --> 12:19.190
I was just scared that
they would put me in jail.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.800
Previously, you had to think.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.850
Yes, I know, just now my brother
is going to a new school and...

12:25.940 --> 12:27.980
I wanted to shit on your brother.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.430
Then I will return to work. Yes,
go ahead.

12:34.890 --> 12:38.310
Due to one of the charges,
Duvall went on the run, right?

12:38.390 --> 12:40.650
Insider trading.

12:40.740 --> 12:44.090
The accusation of divulging
state secrets is much more serious.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.510
Therefore, the United States, Great
Britain, Germany and Switzerland -

12:47.590 --> 12:50.310
all issued warrants for his arrest.

13:03.140 --> 13:06.170
My favorite Italian. How are you,
Massimo?

13:06.250 --> 13:08.330
Fine. I have more work for you.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.730
You know, I like to work.

13:10.820 --> 13:13.170
I want you to find everything you can

13:13.250 --> 13:15.700
to Sabterrania activist Sofia Flores.

13:16.130 --> 13:19.090
Sophia Flores. Okay, I’ll do it.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.080
You are not very happy to see me.

13:41.290 --> 13:43.410
I did not expect you, that’s all.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.560
I do not for a long time.

14:00.150 --> 14:02.150
Did Dominic send you?

14:02.960 --> 14:05.210
I heard what happened and I'm sorry.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.700
And no, I wanted to see you.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.150
What for? Your war must end.

14:14.110 --> 14:16.440
Until you have done what you regret.

14:18.410 --> 14:22.370
He's manipulating you.
Dominic is manipulating everyone.

14:26.410 --> 14:28.410
Do you think he made Carrie leave you?

14:34.220 --> 14:36.220
But I asked her.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.970
For you.

14:43.330 --> 14:46.880
I don't want to hear that. Do
you know why she listened to me?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.580
Because I loved you. I, I...

14:49.790 --> 14:52.876
She left because she knew that you would
be better off in the world of Dominic.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.020
What the hell are you talking about?

14:56.120 --> 14:58.120
And why are you saying this just now?

14:58.210 --> 15:00.210
So you live on.

15:03.020 --> 15:05.020
As I had to.

15:09.350 --> 15:12.510
Your wife is dead. My son is dead.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.960
We must live on.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.250
Together. You better leave.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
Go away

16:20.220 --> 16:22.640
Cool track! Really shakes?

16:22.980 --> 16:26.220
Who's that? Is your brother there?

16:40.610 --> 16:44.510
My boss could get you
some Ed Stewart papers.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.980
What does he want in return?

16:47.060 --> 16:49.730
So you become his man in NYL.

16:49.860 --> 16:52.830
You think I'm thirsty to spy
on a group of anarchists?

16:53.170 --> 16:55.590
Dominic dropped you today.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.240
Rumors quickly disperse.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.610
You represent a danger to him.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.450
He could fire you.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.790
You need these papers.

17:12.569 --> 17:14.569
Agreed.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.700
I will tell him. Under one condition:

17:19.150 --> 17:21.150
We must meet in person.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.680
What for?

17:23.910 --> 17:25.990
I will trust this person my life.

17:26.180 --> 17:28.180
I want to understand
who I'm dealing with.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.750
You ask for a lot. Like him.

17:39.650 --> 17:44.930
Silence! Silence! Get back in line!

17:45.350 --> 17:48.570
Do what I ask, otherwise they
won’t take care of your business!

17:49.000 --> 17:51.140
First,
take the electronic queue number,

17:51.220 --> 17:53.270
the machine is over there.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.710
When they call your number,
come and tell us about your problem.

17:56.890 --> 17:59.430
Clear? Yes! Clear.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.280
I thought your visa was okay,
Mr. Ruggiero.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.460
I need to talk to you.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.220
Because of you,
I was demoted and transferred.

18:17.370 --> 18:19.370
I didn’t want that, I'm sorry.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.880
Say why you came, and get out.

18:22.180 --> 18:25.890
You were right. Ed
Stewart didn’t kill himself.

18:26.030 --> 18:28.330
Thank! But I already knew that.

18:28.420 --> 18:31.440
But it was not me who killed
him. Help me find the killer.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.080
Sounds like I can help? Ed Documents.

18:36.170 --> 18:38.170
I have to see them.

18:38.750 --> 18:42.690
Is this Ed Stewart's writing?
Massimo Ruggiero. Massimo Ruggiero.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.970
Massimo Ruggiero. Massimo Ruggiero.

18:46.590 --> 18:48.870
I look, you do not take arrogance.

18:49.440 --> 18:54.750
Give me the papers, and I'll give you
something in return. More precisely, someone.

18:54.860 --> 18:57.860
Not interested. Daniel Duvall.

18:58.260 --> 19:00.570
Press it - return your position.

19:00.650 --> 19:02.650
Maybe you’ll even be promoted.

19:03.580 --> 19:06.090
How do you know Daniel Duvall?

19:09.510 --> 19:11.510
I sleep with his assistant.

19:14.910 --> 19:16.910
Hit her in the back?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.060
Daniel Duvall in
exchange for those papers.

19:29.980 --> 19:32.300
Good morning. I spoke with Duval.

19:33.780 --> 19:37.090
He is ready to meet. In the evening I
will inform you of the time and place.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.920
Agreed. So we are
definitely on the same side.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.700
Apparently so.

20:01.270 --> 20:04.420
He got in touch with the wrong people
and got involved in criminal matters.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.820
The US is moving towards
a protracted recession.

20:07.970 --> 20:10.850
Experts advise the government...
Where have you been all morning?

20:10.940 --> 20:13.240
Paul put me in the freezer. Freezer?

20:13.320 --> 20:15.830
Yes, to the electronic trading
floor. New powerful servers

20:15.910 --> 20:18.260
work at a temperature
not exceeding two degrees.

20:18.340 --> 20:22.110
And he gave me Southern
Europe. Depression and stagnation.

20:22.340 --> 20:24.890
But he didn’t give me anything.
Is this an alarming sign?

20:25.340 --> 20:28.300
Without a doubt. You're
in the ass! That's bad...

20:28.380 --> 20:31.900
Mr. Harris? Mr. Morgan is
waiting for you. Right now.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.630
Mr. Morgan? What for?

20:34.870 --> 20:37.290
Mr. Morgan does not
like to wait. Come on.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.910
In theory,
a single currency favors investment,

20:44.990 --> 20:47.010
low interest rates, competition...

20:47.100 --> 20:50.320
Just like a dollar in the
States. Euro is not a dollar.

20:50.430 --> 20:53.390
There is no financial or
political unity in the Eurozone.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.600
California is the seventh
largest economy in the world.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.830
If she went bankrupt

20:58.910 --> 21:00.910
the US government
would come to her aid.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.150
Spain, Italy, Portugal,
Greece, Ireland -

21:04.230 --> 21:07.140
they have fewer resources than
California, but they are in shit.

21:07.220 --> 21:09.220
And who will come to their aid?

21:09.330 --> 21:11.360
But the euro is popular.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.670
People think it balances the dollar.

21:13.850 --> 21:16.720
The Euro and the
European Union are dogma.

21:16.810 --> 21:19.750
And you can challenge it,
you can change its perception.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.280
The only question is - how?

21:23.550 --> 21:25.550
Well?

21:25.630 --> 21:29.100
Have you calculated the total
salary of everyone in this office?

21:29.670 --> 21:33.140
How to explain to people

21:33.230 --> 21:36.890
why these countries
are just useless trash.

21:38.420 --> 21:40.420
Mr. Harris?

21:41.010 --> 21:43.040
This is your chance to show

21:43.120 --> 21:45.270
why Massimo considers you promising.

21:47.590 --> 21:49.590
I beg.

22:07.310 --> 22:09.310
Hello.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.840
Can? Yes, please.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
PIGS. What?

22:51.480 --> 22:55.270
Portugal, Ireland,

22:55.720 --> 22:58.490
Greece, Spain.

23:00.130 --> 23:02.130
PIGS.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.590
All these countries have

23:07.680 --> 23:09.790
disgusting amounts of debt,

23:09.940 --> 23:13.640
sloppy state budgets. Pigs.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.250
Well, firstly, you forgot about Italy.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.540
So let there be two
"And." I do not understand.

23:26.630 --> 23:28.820
If you call them that,
they will not get better.

23:29.110 --> 23:31.460
This may affect public opinion.

23:32.220 --> 23:35.180
Oliver, you're really cool.

23:36.420 --> 23:40.220
OK, you can submit a report on Pigs.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.300
By the end of today? Yes of course.

23:43.010 --> 23:45.280
Super. Come on! Get back to work.

23:46.190 --> 23:48.190
Fine. Very well.

23:58.090 --> 24:00.750
Hey. We can meet?

24:02.060 --> 24:04.600
At me, in half an hour. See you later.

24:12.090 --> 24:14.290
Please guys. Thank.

24:17.660 --> 24:21.220
Hi Sam. Vic! What are the fates?

24:21.690 --> 24:24.540
I'm a little tired of
yelling at people. Yeah.

24:24.620 --> 24:26.930
I decided to stop by and
say hello to an old friend.

24:27.020 --> 24:31.190
Yes, I am always glad to see you,
but my shift has come to an end.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.270
Hold on a minute, okay?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.200
What?

24:36.290 --> 24:38.860
I need to look at the
evidence in the Stuart case.

24:39.550 --> 24:42.140
Sorry, you know the rules.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.360
And you’re no longer
working on a case.

24:44.630 --> 24:47.290
I just forgot to make
a copy of one paper.

24:47.380 --> 24:49.420
Make a copy of the evidence -

24:49.500 --> 24:51.500
it’s not quite according to the rules.

24:51.950 --> 24:55.940
You already forgot how last year I
forgot about the rules in your account.

25:00.190 --> 25:02.690
Only a couple of grams disappeared,
and then only once.

25:04.980 --> 25:10.910
Now I'm clean. I fastened.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.290
Remember then the rules,
you would not work here.

25:18.280 --> 25:22.330
Looks like your Miss Flores was being
watched by our friends from Interpol.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.820
Mostly because of ties to Sabterrania.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.940
AND? Have a drink?

25:27.020 --> 25:29.340
Oh yes. Will you have whiskey?

25:30.240 --> 25:34.070
And pour yourself. You also
want when you hear everything.

25:37.620 --> 25:40.970
Long list. Where to begin?

25:41.800 --> 25:43.800
Start from the beginning. Good.

25:45.460 --> 25:49.790
Her parents died in a car accident
in Buenos Aires when she was seven.

25:50.150 --> 25:53.260
Then her brother,
Ramiro, took care of her.

25:53.900 --> 25:56.440
He had a small production. Thank.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.450
Until two thousand and one...

26:01.840 --> 26:05.140
Return my money! Ramiro went bankrupt.

26:06.030 --> 26:08.030
No!

26:10.090 --> 26:12.450
And she had to live on the street.

26:12.660 --> 26:14.660
Heck.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.260
He said it was a sad
story. What did she live for?

26:20.090 --> 26:26.110
Like other desperate
girls. So she met Duval.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.840
At that time he was an economist,

26:30.040 --> 26:32.040
flew to Buenos Aires for a conference.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.180
His marriage has just broken up.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.850
And he lost his place in college.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.190
How old was she? Sixteen,
maybe seventeen.

26:41.340 --> 26:43.340
Did he sleep with her?

26:44.880 --> 26:46.880
No idea.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.140
Duval just founded Sabterrania
when Sofia entered the university,

26:50.220 --> 26:53.940
and he paid for his studies.
She received an honors degree.

26:55.570 --> 26:58.970
Since then they travel the
world and expose bankers

26:59.050 --> 27:02.260
and hedge fund managers.
Now aiming at you.

27:03.400 --> 27:07.090
Probably. May I pick it up?

27:07.170 --> 27:09.170
Of course. Fine.

27:15.420 --> 27:17.420
Come in.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.330
This is the report that
Mr. Morgan requested.

27:21.070 --> 27:23.300
Oh... pigs.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.930
You doused them with mud? Doused,
sir. One dirt.

27:31.470 --> 27:33.710
Super! Come on, drink something.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.570
What now? After all, only five hours.

27:36.710 --> 27:39.680
We just have to be in
time. Where to catch?

27:40.070 --> 27:42.370
I told clients that you are
shorting Spanish banks.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.800
AND? They abut. - Wait.

27:44.950 --> 27:47.656
When the banks begin to roll in,
customers will come back to you smarter

27:47.680 --> 27:50.140
followed by the rest. Keep shorting?

27:50.240 --> 27:52.570
Yes. Where is Kalim? In the freezer.

27:52.650 --> 27:54.710
Bring him to me as soon as you can.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.800
Good. Thank.

28:20.860 --> 28:22.900
Massimo... Hello.

28:22.980 --> 28:25.920
Thank god you called
me. I chilled to the bones.

28:26.150 --> 28:29.160
I want to find old folders. I'm
afraid we did not digitize them.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.290
Ok, which ones?

28:31.370 --> 28:34.200
On the bankruptcy of De
Rosa Bank in Argentina in 2001.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.600
Yes! I remember what
happened then. Truth?

28:37.950 --> 28:41.160
A small bank,
five billion dollars in assets,

28:41.240 --> 28:44.600
one of the three that fell on
the seventh of March 2001.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.750
Almost sure it was Wednesday.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.850
Why do you remember all this? Massimo,
have you really forgotten about this?

28:50.920 --> 28:52.950
About what?

28:53.030 --> 28:55.490
We bought all non-working
assets of the bank.

28:57.230 --> 28:59.330
That was your idea.

29:00.980 --> 29:05.220
We bought all the non-performing assets
of the banks of the Mercosur block,

29:05.310 --> 29:07.540
and dofiga earned it.

29:35.120 --> 29:39.330
We destroyed the borrowers.
Shit happens. But that was cool.

29:44.410 --> 29:47.190
We have earned five
hundred million dollars!

29:47.570 --> 29:50.210
Rivers of champagne flowed that day.

29:52.340 --> 29:54.660
Everyone went home, dancing.

30:09.390 --> 30:12.950
And you got a prize from Dominic - the
brand new Porsche. Do you remember?

30:19.290 --> 30:21.290
Yes.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.930
I don’t know about you,
but I need a drink. I'm with you.

30:28.520 --> 30:31.450
Massimo,
what do you say? Our turn to treat.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.540
I still have to work.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.290
Come on. Okay. Come on.

30:36.380 --> 30:38.380
Let's go. - Till! See you later!

30:39.160 --> 30:42.170
We do not need this at all!
We asked for something else!

30:42.250 --> 30:45.100
We do not need hunger,
we do not need poverty!

30:45.220 --> 30:47.300
We did not apply to the
International Monetary Fund.

30:47.380 --> 30:50.480
Argentina! Argentina!

30:50.860 --> 30:53.420
Emma. Home in the house.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.020
We are together again.

30:57.110 --> 30:59.280
How much is enough
for us - hell knows!

31:00.240 --> 31:02.240
Do you have anybody?

31:03.140 --> 31:06.500
Yes, I have a girlfriend. Latoya.

31:07.150 --> 31:10.820
Latoya is a wonderful name.
Do not offend her and do not mow.

31:12.540 --> 31:14.750
Yes, you are just lucky today.

31:15.710 --> 31:17.710
You won’t get off for a long time.

31:18.150 --> 31:21.260
Understand. I have no illusions.

31:21.340 --> 31:23.730
Okay, I’ll go out. I'll be back soon.

31:28.510 --> 31:32.050
Just don’t mess with this guy, otherwise
you will end up in a monkey house!

31:34.190 --> 31:37.490
Hey. Are you sucking on a new boss?

31:37.760 --> 31:41.610
If not for Massimo, you would
still have passed exams for others.

31:41.790 --> 31:45.250
If not for the two of you,
Massimo would have been the boss.

31:46.190 --> 31:48.640
And if not... Forget it.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.080
Detective?

32:32.640 --> 32:34.640
I know the time and place.

33:16.180 --> 33:19.080
Remember my former workmate,
Sergeant Winx?

33:19.160 --> 33:22.530
Mr. Ruggiero. Do you have documents?

33:22.990 --> 33:25.300
Get them when we take Duval.

33:25.950 --> 33:28.340
We value your service to
the community, Mr. Ruggiero.

33:28.680 --> 33:31.450
Help in catching two fugitives.

33:31.790 --> 33:34.030
Two? Yes.

33:34.110 --> 33:37.690
If your girlfriend was hiding Duval,
she is his accomplice.

33:38.830 --> 33:41.480
They both go to jail
for a very long time.

33:42.410 --> 33:44.410
Really wonderful?

33:44.570 --> 33:47.990
To side with the law, at least once.

33:59.900 --> 34:01.980
Did you really get him the documents?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.540
I have them.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.400
But how?

34:08.159 --> 34:10.159
Do not ask.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.960
If we take Duval,
do you really give them away?

34:20.150 --> 34:22.150
We will see.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.100
And if he does not surrender Duvall?

34:28.320 --> 34:33.969
We are already at the bottom.
Without Duval, we will remain there.

35:05.180 --> 35:08.200
The address has
changed. Bankside Pier.

36:13.930 --> 36:17.910
What the hell is he doing?!
More likely! Come on! Faster!

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Get out of the way faster!

36:21.050 --> 36:23.250
Do not lose it, Henry!

36:30.100 --> 36:32.100
Come on, come on, come on!

36:37.340 --> 36:39.340
He is there, there!

36:46.130 --> 36:48.540
You cannot keep up
with him on this car.

37:24.620 --> 37:26.680
Faster, faster, faster!

37:26.760 --> 37:28.760
He is waiting for us on board. Hey.

37:29.260 --> 37:31.300
What? “You need to run.” What?

37:33.440 --> 37:35.730
What are you talking about?
The police are coming here.

37:39.070 --> 37:41.940
They promised me to give
evidence in exchange for Duval.

37:42.870 --> 37:47.440
I'm sorry you have to
run. Forgive me. Go away.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.520
Don't you dare touch me!

38:11.640 --> 38:14.760
What are you doing?
And where is Duval?

38:15.250 --> 38:18.250
He did not come. What do you mean,
didn’t come?

38:20.470 --> 38:22.470
I'm sorry.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.760
But I need these documents. Highly.

38:25.850 --> 38:28.131
Then it was worth fulfilling
its part of the transaction.

38:31.020 --> 38:33.230
Come, Henry, back to the bottom.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.500
Your mother...

39:13.570 --> 39:16.160
You should invest better in security.

39:16.530 --> 39:18.530
I can call the police.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.950
You already called them in the morning

39:21.040 --> 39:24.510
when they visited Detective
Bale at the immigration center.

39:28.150 --> 39:30.420
You weren’t on that boat, right?

39:31.710 --> 39:35.560
You know, we are very
similar. Nothing in common.

39:35.780 --> 39:38.440
I used to be an economist,

39:38.520 --> 39:40.750
consultant to
international corporations.

39:40.830 --> 39:43.310
Oh really? We acted like this:

39:43.850 --> 39:48.040
Found an underdeveloped
country that had something valuable,

39:48.120 --> 39:50.820
for example, gold and even rubber.

39:51.410 --> 39:53.850
Then I convinced this country

39:53.930 --> 39:57.700
to take huge loans from the
World Bank for development.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.940
Only the country has
not seen this money.

40:02.350 --> 40:05.630
They went to my real
customers - contractors.

40:07.190 --> 40:10.990
In fact, we took the money
and left the country in debt.

40:11.450 --> 40:15.940
And then - picking up her
resources was just as easy,

40:16.060 --> 40:18.230
how to take candy from a child.

40:20.380 --> 40:25.390
I was a killer. Economic killer.

40:26.730 --> 40:28.730
I was killing people

40:30.700 --> 40:33.250
without weapons.

40:33.380 --> 40:38.200
I do not kill people. Just
like you kill, Massimo.

40:45.660 --> 40:49.010
Kill. Such as brother Sofia.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.120
You are only a pawn
in a dishonest game,

40:53.200 --> 40:56.330
where the poor get poorer
and the rich get richer.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.750
But this bubble will burst soon.

41:00.300 --> 41:02.300
Earlier than you think.

41:02.590 --> 41:06.120
And then it is better to be
on the side of the winners.

41:19.350 --> 41:22.220
How many peasants did
you put Sofia into bed?

41:23.070 --> 41:25.300
How many? What does
it mean - how much?

41:26.260 --> 41:28.400
As far as I know,

41:28.550 --> 41:30.610
she slept with you
of her own free will.

41:32.200 --> 41:36.060
But perhaps human
desires are alien to you.

41:47.180 --> 41:49.180
You know how to find me.

42:02.780 --> 42:04.780
This is the most serious law.

42:04.870 --> 42:07.340
About unauthorized
trade in British history.

42:07.420 --> 42:09.420
And again to the
news of "Sabterrania" -

42:09.500 --> 42:12.770
an underground organization
founded by Daniel Duvall.

42:12.860 --> 42:16.040
The purpose of the organization,
according to its founder, is

42:16.120 --> 42:20.960
Exposing the fraud of governments,
banks and corporations...

42:21.510 --> 42:24.620
Here's a secret report,
an internal study from NYL,

42:24.710 --> 42:27.510
one of the largest banks in the city.

42:27.940 --> 42:31.880
So what is PIIGS? And what
does the pig have to do with it?

42:32.050 --> 42:34.290
In fact,
these are the countries of Europe:

42:34.920 --> 42:38.580
Portugal, Ireland,
Greece, Spain. Plus Italy.

42:38.940 --> 42:42.870
Insiders in the financial sector
call them pigs for slaughter.

42:43.050 --> 42:46.220
This is my report. Your mother... Why
are they called pigs for slaughter?

42:46.300 --> 42:49.360
Because they have poor fundamentals.

42:49.620 --> 42:52.430
And they take the last from
the economy of Northern Europe.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.420
You just waste your time!

42:55.500 --> 42:58.050
You do what you don’t like,

42:58.130 --> 43:00.740
to continue another hated occupation!

43:02.490 --> 43:04.570
Watch the news, Margaret.

43:04.650 --> 43:06.660
Yes? Is there something good there?

43:07.450 --> 43:09.770
Someone leaked the
press one secret report.

43:10.670 --> 43:12.880
Now everyone is talking about pigs.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.170
Fine! But I also have news,

43:16.260 --> 43:18.300
and they are bad. Tell me.

43:18.380 --> 43:21.390
"Standard & Poor’s" is going to
downgrade the US government debt rating.

43:21.470 --> 43:23.610
They withdraw the AAA
rating from the Treasury.

43:23.690 --> 43:25.690
They will not dare!

43:25.770 --> 43:28.630
We’ll have to act
faster than we planned,

43:28.720 --> 43:30.970
and this administration
will not help us.

43:31.060 --> 43:33.330
Our friend from Reintaler
Bank will not be happy.

43:33.420 --> 43:36.020
We have been cussing
with them for too long.

43:36.370 --> 43:39.680
I’ll deal with everything. Thanks,
House. I was hoping for it.

44:48.980 --> 44:50.980
I didn’t think that I
would see you again.

44:51.770 --> 44:53.920
Why did you change your mind?

44:56.720 --> 45:01.930
Why didn’t you just finish the job?

45:02.290 --> 45:04.290
Because I think

45:04.950 --> 45:06.950
you have to work for me.

45:16.730 --> 45:20.080
Already worked. Corrected your jamb.

45:39.620 --> 45:41.960
Papers by Edward Stewart? Yeah.

45:59.470 --> 46:03.030
How did you get them? Penetrated
Detective Bale’s apartment.

46:05.410 --> 46:08.530
She will see that they
are gone. Shit happens.

46:09.100 --> 46:11.100
Yes.

46:13.430 --> 46:15.430
Let's figure it out.

46:32.840 --> 46:36.040
They claim that the cause
of the crisis is terrible pigs!

46:36.120 --> 46:38.320
Well, you know,
PIIGS? What other PIIGS?

46:38.400 --> 46:41.430
Financial markets are shaking
from a group of European countries.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.630
Called PIIGS. Or, otherwise, "Pigs."

46:44.710 --> 46:46.710
The idea of ​​Eurobonds is supported

46:46.790 --> 46:48.930
representatives of the
so-called PIIGS countries,

46:49.020 --> 46:51.376
Let me remind you, these are Portugal,
Italy, Greece and Spain.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.400
"Pigs."

46:56.060 --> 46:58.060
"Pigs."

46:58.140 --> 47:02.410
Portugal, Ireland, Italy,
Greece, Spain. We are all pigs.
