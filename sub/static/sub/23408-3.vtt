WEBVTT

00:05.880 --> 00:07.040
You've done well,
Numidian.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.000
There's one more thing
I want you to do.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.240
I am Vitus Aurelius,

00:11.280 --> 00:12.640
optio of the Eighth Legion.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.960
Fuck off back to Rome!

00:15.000 --> 00:16.440
Now it's a war.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.560
Yesterday, I sent an envoy
to parley with your father.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.000
Did he change his mind?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.120
Does he even know you're here?

00:22.160 --> 00:26.120
Stop killing my people.
Then I'll talk.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.320
The Regni will
accept you here,

00:27.360 --> 00:29.640
but only as allies
against the Cantii scum.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.000
You trust the Regni?

00:32.040 --> 00:33.840
Hatred
is far more reliable.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.480
Camp here.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.360
If I'm not back by sunrise,
you join the others.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.160
You understand?

00:38.200 --> 00:39.320
Yes, sir.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.520
Fuck me.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.560
Dad wasn't at home.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.240
He could have been
taken prisoner.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.480
Your dad's dead.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.720
I saw him get killed.

00:47.760 --> 00:48.920
You lying bastard!

00:48.960 --> 00:50.000
All right, I made it up.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.040
I'll find the fucking Romans
myself!

00:53.080 --> 00:55.600
You have been warned,
Aulus Plautius!

00:55.640 --> 00:57.200
Make amends!

00:59.240 --> 01:00.880
Are you sure
you're ready, Rome?

01:00.920 --> 01:03.560
Ready for what you'll find?

01:03.600 --> 01:05.239
I'm ready.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.240
Then let's begin.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

02:00.800 --> 02:03.600
He looks... shiny.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.080
Shiny, or slippy?

02:10.440 --> 02:12.280
Like a newborn baby.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.120
Our baby.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.800
That's it.
I'm off.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.120
Just give it a minute.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.280
He said if he's not
back by sunrise.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.840
It's sunrise.
It was an order.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.160
If he comes back,
finds we've gone,

02:28.200 --> 02:29.160
he's not going
to be happy.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.400
So give it a minute.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.600
One minute.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.360
You hear those
wolves last night?

02:37.520 --> 02:39.240
Wolves, Decimus?

02:39.280 --> 02:40.240
Banshees...

02:40.280 --> 02:41.320
screaming warnings to us

02:41.360 --> 02:43.400
to depart this
devil-infested land.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.120
And they're not wrong, mate.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.640
Who are we
waiting for again?

02:50.680 --> 02:52.360
What?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.160
I just forgot.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.720
I just forgot.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.880
The General, you nob.
What's wrong with you?

02:59.920 --> 03:02.400
Where did he go?
The General?

03:02.440 --> 03:03.880
And where did he go?

03:03.920 --> 03:05.880
The General?

03:05.920 --> 03:07.160
Search me.
He never said.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.160
Are you all right, mate?

03:10.200 --> 03:12.400
I'm just a bit sleepy.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.400
I'm just a bit sleepy.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.280
Aren't you?

03:18.320 --> 03:20.040
Now that you mention it...

03:21.240 --> 03:22.600
Now that you mention it...

03:22.640 --> 03:23.720
One...

03:23.760 --> 03:25.600
two...

03:25.640 --> 03:27.280
three.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.760
Morrigan!

03:59.800 --> 04:03.320
Long time no see!

04:03.360 --> 04:05.400
What are you doing
with these assholes?

04:10.800 --> 04:13.280
Tell me about it.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.160
I wouldn't be seen dead
with them either...

04:17.360 --> 04:19.399
but these are dark times.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.760
No turning back now.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.960
Cantii!

05:47.000 --> 05:49.080
The Romans are back.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.080
Before the snows come,

05:53.120 --> 05:55.800
we'll drive the bastards

05:55.840 --> 05:58.160
back into the sea
from where they came!

06:25.080 --> 06:26.080
Hi.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.760
Drop it, now!

06:30.800 --> 06:32.360
-Gentlemen...
-Are you deaf?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Who are you?

06:35.040 --> 06:36.560
A passing stranger.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.680
What are you doing?

06:37.720 --> 06:39.600
I was passing,

06:39.640 --> 06:41.320
as you do when you're...
you know...

06:41.360 --> 06:43.440
but then I saw you had food,

06:43.480 --> 06:45.200
so at first,
I was going to just...

06:45.240 --> 06:48.680
eat the food while you slept,
so... and then sneak away,

06:48.720 --> 06:51.240
but then
I changed my mind.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.800
I had a better idea,

06:52.840 --> 06:54.640
and so I stuck around.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.720
It is a much more
dangerous option,

06:59.760 --> 07:01.680
but the benefits
are potentially huge.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
You see?

07:48.520 --> 07:49.880
Let's just cut his
throat and be on our way.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.480
He could be
worth something.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.760
He stinks like
a dead camel.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.800
He could know stuff.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.280
It's true. I could.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.320
I could know stuff.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.800
Shut the fuck up.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.880
Milo got five talents
bringing in that spy in Gaul.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.120
That's because
he was a spy,

08:05.160 --> 08:07.160
not some Celt tramp
smelling of shit.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.840
Strictly speaking,
I'm not a Celt.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.960
Not a big deal.
I know we all look the same.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.400
He'll slow us down.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.000
Five talents
is five talents.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.560
Why don't you
let the gods decide?

08:15.600 --> 08:17.040
You do have gods?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.840
Toss a coin, let them choose.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.760
Here, I've got one
here in my pocket.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.680
This is Roman.

08:24.720 --> 08:25.840
Yeah.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.000
Actually, it's yours.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.120
You took my coin?

08:28.160 --> 08:30.080
While you were sleeping.
Sorry. Sorry.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.440
Fucking hell!

08:32.480 --> 08:34.640
Come on,
get it over with.

08:34.679 --> 08:35.679
Call.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.760
Heads...
no, tails.

08:37.799 --> 08:38.880
Tails what?

08:38.919 --> 08:39.960
Tails, we do him,
or tails, he lives?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.039
Which is better?

08:41.080 --> 08:42.320
Mind if I choose,
since it's my life?

08:42.360 --> 08:43.280
Shut the fuck up!

08:45.320 --> 08:46.280
All right.
Heads, he lives.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.320
Tails, we do him.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.600
Tails.

08:48.640 --> 08:49.480
You don't have
to call it.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.720
You said I did.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.840
Can we just do this?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.040
Best of three?

08:55.080 --> 08:56.560
Wha... is that fair?

08:56.600 --> 08:58.160
You stay out of this.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.800
Again.
Again!

09:02.240 --> 09:03.200
Give me that!

09:03.240 --> 09:05.200
This could take a while.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.480
Heads.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.320
Come on...

09:18.160 --> 09:20.200
All right.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.720
This is the one.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.880
Who are you?

11:42.760 --> 11:43.760
Why did you go
to the Romans?

11:45.520 --> 11:46.920
To save the lives
of our people.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.080
You betrayed your king
to save a few slaves?

11:50.120 --> 11:52.000
If it was betrayal, why
didn't you tell him?

11:52.040 --> 11:53.880
Admit it.
You did it just to defy him.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.400
You blame him for what happened
to your mother.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.720
So I'm vengeful
and reckless,

11:57.760 --> 11:59.840
yet still you didn't tell him.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.280
You want to know why
I didn't tell him?

12:07.320 --> 12:08.400
Because we both know

12:08.440 --> 12:10.080
he'd go straight
to the Druids,

12:10.120 --> 12:11.440
and the Druids would have you
flayed alive.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.320
And we both know

12:12.360 --> 12:14.680
that I would have deserved it.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.200
The Druids are infallible.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.720
They speak for the gods.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.840
Is that why you cut the balls
off the husband they chose?

12:21.040 --> 12:23.560
Yet... you did their bidding.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.080
Amena is a snake.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.280
Her ambition is endless.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.600
I married her for my tribe.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.160
For my people,
I'll sacrifice everything...

12:30.200 --> 12:32.480
as you clearly
will for yours.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
Thank you.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.880
What for?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.240
Just saying that.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.760
For saving my life.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.920
For not telling.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.440
You've not been here long,

12:40.480 --> 12:43.320
yet already, I owe you
a whole litany of debts.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.520
Keeping
a close eye?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.800
Question is, on who?

12:54.840 --> 12:56.520
Here's some advice.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.040
Keep an eye on your husband.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.000
You really don't
trust anyone

13:02.040 --> 13:04.120
who didn't suck
on your mummy's tit.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.760
Guilty.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.680
I trust my own blood,
occasionally my wife,

13:09.720 --> 13:11.480
but I never trust a Gaul.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.920
Just to say,
we haven't forgotten about you,

13:21.960 --> 13:24.000
but we've got rather
a lot of big stuff

13:24.040 --> 13:25.600
to deal with at the moment.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.920
Well, thanks
for the update,

13:26.960 --> 13:29.120
but that's not why
you came, is it?

13:29.160 --> 13:31.720
You came because
I summoned you.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.800
How exactly
did you summon me?

13:32.840 --> 13:35.560
Don't pretend you
don't know who I am.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.760
You are Ania,

13:37.800 --> 13:41.080
niece of our sworn enemy,
Antedia.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.200
You really don't, do you?

13:43.240 --> 13:44.360
Although to be fair,
there's nothing in the prophecy

13:44.400 --> 13:45.200
to say you should.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.240
The prophecy?

13:48.480 --> 13:49.880
Ania is my earthly name,

13:49.920 --> 13:52.320
but in truth,
I am something else...

13:52.360 --> 13:55.160
something
far, far more powerful.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.360
So who are you?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.160
I am Brenna.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.640
The goddess of war?

13:59.680 --> 14:03.880
And dreams, and wells.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.480
You knew, didn't you?

14:06.440 --> 14:07.960
Look, it's been a long day.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.320
Brenna has four aspects.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.680
Water, fire,
wind, earth.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.880
I am her earthly form.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.520
There I was,

14:15.560 --> 14:17.200
thinking that I'd captured
a Regni princess,

14:17.240 --> 14:19.200
whereas actually, I've captured
an immortal goddess.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.080
Don't blame yourself.
It was foretold.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.320
What, in the prophecy?

14:22.360 --> 14:23.920
Exactly.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.600
I need you to lie with me.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.680
The prophecy tells

14:30.720 --> 14:35.120
that Brenna will be rescued
by a golden-haired mortal,

14:35.160 --> 14:37.840
and together,
they will spawn a pantheon

14:37.880 --> 14:40.640
to rule the heavens
for a thousand years.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.000
I see.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.200
It's your destiny.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.400
You will be honoured
by the gods.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.200
My mother, Danu,
will shine fortune upon you

14:53.240 --> 14:56.360
and upon your tribe forever.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.840
Well, I suppose
I could spare five minutes.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Help!

15:33.480 --> 15:34.440
Help!

15:34.480 --> 15:35.840
Help me!

15:43.040 --> 15:44.240
We'd struck camp

15:44.280 --> 15:46.560
and were heading north
through the forest,

15:46.600 --> 15:47.600
when we were ambushed.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.120
Out of nowhere,
they surrounded us.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.000
How many?

15:51.040 --> 15:52.720
Two dozen, maybe more.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.000
How many down?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.560
Three that I saw,
but...

15:55.600 --> 15:57.920
I don't think
anyone survived.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.040
Except you.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.760
How long ago was this?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.760
Just after sunrise.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.720
Maybe later.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.640
Nine miles away.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.560
Give or take.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.960
Don't say anything
to the men,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.840
not until the
General returns.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.320
There was a skirmish.
You got separated.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.360
You came back here.
Understood?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.280
Understood, sir.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.480
Take this man.
Get him cleaned up.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.400
Give him wine
for the pain.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.960
Thank you,
Praefectus.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.720
Thank you, sir.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.680
Where the hell
are you, Aulus?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.600
Fuck it!

17:00.520 --> 17:02.760
You all right, man?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.440
I can't sleep.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.599
Soon as I close my eyes,

17:05.640 --> 17:08.839
I see Islene and Cait
all alone.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.520
You know how I
sleep at night?

17:12.560 --> 17:14.520
I dream I'm pissing in
that bastard's skull.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.359
I may try that.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.800
You!

17:22.760 --> 17:23.960
Come here.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.320
You were talking
to your lover there.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.240
What did you say?

17:37.280 --> 17:39.760
Nothing, sir.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.520
Do I look stupid?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.520
Tell me what you said.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.880
I didn't say anything.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.680
Upsy-daisy,
lover boy.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.040
Please, sir...

17:52.080 --> 17:53.240
Up you get!

17:53.280 --> 17:54.120
Have mercy.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.200
"Please, sir, have mercy."

17:58.200 --> 17:59.720
Hey!

18:12.200 --> 18:13.560
Sir.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.920
This slave
attacked Tiberius.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.600
Bring him inside.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.560
I've been thinking,

18:27.600 --> 18:31.520
and I'm interested to know
why you guys came back here.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.360
I mean,
your ancestors' bones lie here,

18:34.400 --> 18:35.520
unburied,

18:35.560 --> 18:38.080
unanointed...

18:38.120 --> 18:40.880
their spirits doomed
to wander forever.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.720
Seriously,

18:42.760 --> 18:44.080
who wants
a second helping of that?

18:44.120 --> 18:45.800
My ancestors
are in Sicily,

18:45.840 --> 18:47.840
safely cremated,
in the family vault.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.440
Yeah, but it didn't
exactly go well last time.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.880
I mean, last time,
Nature herself took revenge.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.360
A great storm
destroyed your ships,

18:56.400 --> 18:57.640
drowned your soldiers.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.880
So we got unlucky
with the weather.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.360
It won't happen twice.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.960
Suit yourself, Decimus.

19:02.000 --> 19:02.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

19:06.080 --> 19:07.680
How'd you
know my name?

19:07.720 --> 19:09.920
Well, you're Decimus Sentus...
from Sicily.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.600
Your family are goat farmers,

19:11.640 --> 19:13.360
but you, you hate
the little bastards,

19:13.400 --> 19:14.720
so you joined the army.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.160
Who told you that?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.680
Well, he did,

19:19.720 --> 19:20.920
while you were having
a shit back there.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.120
No, I never!

19:22.160 --> 19:24.680
Come, come now,
Philo of Rome...

19:24.720 --> 19:26.400
who is not sure
who his real parents are,

19:26.440 --> 19:29.880
and grew up penniless
in a house full of whores.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.200
You know...

19:31.240 --> 19:32.880
Decimus here thinks
your mum was one of them...

19:34.480 --> 19:36.040
but he has no proof,

19:36.080 --> 19:37.320
so it's just theory.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.520
What the fuck?

19:39.560 --> 19:40.600
My mother wasn't a whore.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.160
No...

19:42.200 --> 19:43.040
but it stands to reason.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.120
Fuck you.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.160
Fuck me?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.280
Fuck you,
and your whore mother.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.920
Boys, boys,
don't do this.

19:49.960 --> 19:50.920
You're friends.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.200
-Say it again.
-Shut your...

19:52.240 --> 19:53.960
Don't say it again.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.800
You have no proof
that Philo's mum was a whore,

19:57.840 --> 19:59.960
no proof whatsoever.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.360
Listen.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.080
Listen very carefully.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.400
I'm going
to show you something.

20:12.760 --> 20:13.840
You see this pebble?

20:13.880 --> 20:17.080
This is a very special pebble.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.520
It is called...

20:20.320 --> 20:21.800
the Big...

20:23.200 --> 20:24.640
Big Pebble.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.560
It's nice, isn't it?

20:27.600 --> 20:28.440
It's lovely.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.720
It's lovely
and smooth.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.480
Yeah.
Now, keep looking at it.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.640
Now, what does it
make you feel?

20:36.680 --> 20:38.000
-Calm.
-Happy.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.040
-Excellent.
-Big Pebble.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.160
Big Pebble.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.640
Excellent.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.080
Good.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.360
Now, here's what
we are going to do.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.000
First, you're going
to untie me...

20:54.320 --> 20:56.960
and then we are all going
to travel together,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
like friends,

20:59.040 --> 21:01.840
and you're going
to show me your camp.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.520
So what do you say?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.680
Do we have a deal?

21:12.640 --> 21:15.120
Why did you attack
my centurion?

21:15.160 --> 21:18.440
Because I felt like it.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.800
You just...
felt like it.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.600
Our dead will see you,
and you know it.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.680
You know what I see
when I look in your eyes?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.480
Fear.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.200
Now, tell me, what do you see
when you look in mine?

21:32.880 --> 21:34.040
Well, now...

21:39.640 --> 21:41.040
let's have a look.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.400
You've just given me an idea.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.800
To hell with the invaders!

22:04.120 --> 22:06.080
Death to the invaders!

22:13.880 --> 22:15.360
Cait...

22:24.840 --> 22:26.840
Now...

22:26.880 --> 22:28.760
let's have a closer look
at those eyes.

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
Ah!

22:33.480 --> 22:35.080
Behold the rebel!

23:15.080 --> 23:17.040
They'll ransom us.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.680
A Roman must be worth more
alive than dead.

23:19.720 --> 23:20.960
In Gaul,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.120
we offered a thousand talents
for one soldier.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.920
They sent back his heart
on a wooden plate.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.720
So why are we still alive?

23:28.760 --> 23:30.760
Because they
want information,

23:30.800 --> 23:32.680
and they'll do everything
in their power to get it,

23:32.720 --> 23:35.440
and we must do everything
to prevent that.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.040
I can do it.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.400
You can have
no doubts.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.520
Not one.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.200
I'm not afraid.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.280
In any battle...

23:45.320 --> 23:47.560
on any field.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.560
For every man,
no matter how strong,

23:50.600 --> 23:53.240
there comes a river
he cannot cross.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.440
Cut my tongue out.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.280
I don't have a knife.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.840
If you ever make it
back to Rome,

24:23.880 --> 24:26.280
will you tell
my wife and children?

24:28.800 --> 24:31.320
It will be
the first thing I do.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.920
We were going
to kill Vespasian.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.000
We drew lots.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.200
That's not important now.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.840
I've disgraced my legion.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.680
But your courage
now absolves you.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.920
You die with honour.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.840
Thank you, brother.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.800
My friend didn't feel
like talking today.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.680
But you do?

25:31.240 --> 25:32.640
No.

25:32.680 --> 25:33.880
Well...

25:33.920 --> 25:36.520
we'll see.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.880
Are you hurt?

25:50.920 --> 25:53.760
Where are
your bodyguards?

25:53.800 --> 25:54.840
Have they not returned?

25:54.880 --> 25:55.880
No.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.480
Where's Vespasian?

25:58.520 --> 25:59.560
Dead.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.920
The recce party
was ambushed in country.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.240
Wiped out...

26:04.280 --> 26:05.040
all except one.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.920
Who escaped?

26:06.960 --> 26:07.840
Some grunt,

26:07.880 --> 26:10.040
spinning a story
I'm not buying.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.880
Ambush or mutiny,

26:11.920 --> 26:13.120
everyone else
is dead or captured.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.320
What's this?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.080
Ah, some... bullshit.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.320
Where the fuck have you been?

26:19.360 --> 26:21.920
I turn my back
for five minutes...

26:32.760 --> 26:34.480
What's going on?

26:34.520 --> 26:36.800
I went to see the Druids.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.280
How many ships?

26:53.600 --> 26:55.160
How many ships?

27:36.800 --> 27:39.120
How many ships?

27:42.080 --> 27:43.200
So...

27:43.240 --> 27:45.720
you have nothing to say?

27:48.320 --> 27:49.920
How's your daughter?

27:49.960 --> 27:51.680
What?

27:51.720 --> 27:54.160
The pretty one...

27:55.160 --> 27:56.080
with the red hair.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.440
She came to see us.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.160
Tell her...

28:07.200 --> 28:09.560
the General
sends his best.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.160
Father...

28:23.440 --> 28:24.760
Did you know this?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.040
No, Father.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.120
Tell me the Roman lies.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.800
He casts a spell
to throw us off-course.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.040
He speaks the truth.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.640
Since you were a child,

28:48.680 --> 28:49.720
you've despised me,

28:49.760 --> 28:53.240
but my love
drowned out your hate,

28:53.280 --> 28:55.200
your endless defiance,

28:55.240 --> 28:58.720
and now I see
that it wasn't love.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.040
It was weakness.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.560
I've sent messengers
to Veran the Druid.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.640
The Druids now
will decide your fate.

29:05.680 --> 29:08.200
Your life, your soul,

29:08.240 --> 29:10.440
is in their hands.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.720
Then you throw
me to the winds.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.440
You did it
to yourself,

29:13.480 --> 29:15.960
to follow your mother,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.520
a path you planned
long ago.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.600
You're wrong, Father.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.480
I don't hate you.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.200
You are a good man,

29:23.240 --> 29:25.080
but your faith
has blinded you.

29:25.120 --> 29:28.680
It is not you who I despise.
It is the Druids.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.160
You say that to wound me
a thousand times deeper.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.480
I say it
because it is the truth.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.320
So let them come here.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.240
Let them condemn me,

29:38.280 --> 29:39.720
and as they tear my flesh,

29:39.760 --> 29:41.160
I will do as she did.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.400
I will look you in the
eye to let you know

29:42.440 --> 29:44.320
that there is no blame
for you,

29:44.360 --> 29:45.680
no hatred,

29:45.720 --> 29:48.560
and no fear for their blind,
mindless chaos

29:48.600 --> 29:50.760
that you call justice.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.480
Guards!

29:54.440 --> 29:55.480
Know this.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.000
Whatever the Druids decide,

29:58.040 --> 30:01.200
you are dead to me.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.960
Know this.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.400
Whatever the Druids decide,

30:06.440 --> 30:08.680
I love you...

30:08.720 --> 30:10.640
just as she did.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.040
Well, this is a surprise.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.560
Your next word
will be your last.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.720
No, I mean it, mate.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.400
You're the best
friend ever.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.880
Rubbish, mate.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.440
You are.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.240
Listen, mate,
you were right.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.080
My mother was a whore.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.440
Well,
she was...

31:04.000 --> 31:05.480
she was still your mother,

31:05.520 --> 31:07.800
and that's what counts.

31:07.840 --> 31:08.800
Thanks, Decimus.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.920
That means a lot.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.240
Looks like your general
is returned.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.120
Here.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.480
Thanks, friend.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.360
That's lovely.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.720
Now...

31:31.760 --> 31:35.360
we are going
to focus on the circle,

31:35.400 --> 31:37.280
because this is important.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.760
Now, keep looking.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.480
Here's the plan.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.600
Are we listening?

31:49.640 --> 31:50.720
All ears.

31:50.760 --> 31:51.960
Good.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.880
We wait 'til
night falls.

31:54.920 --> 31:58.120
Then we're going
to tie me up again,

31:58.160 --> 32:00.880
and you're going
to take me into the camp,

32:00.920 --> 32:03.120
into the General's tent.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.760
Easy.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.400
Right.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.640
Now, I'm a spy.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.480
I have important information...

32:15.480 --> 32:16.320
What do you want?

32:16.360 --> 32:17.960
-Who's this?
-Who are you?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
I need your help.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.120
Go away.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.000
Can't you see I'm busy?

32:21.040 --> 32:22.840
-She's scaring me.
-Go away!

32:22.880 --> 32:24.280
It's fine. It's fine.
She's nothing.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.120
Sit down.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.520
It's fine.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.960
Focus.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.040
Focus on the circle.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.320
What do you see?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.000
Oh, oh, oh!

32:33.040 --> 32:34.040
What happened?

32:35.240 --> 32:36.520
Shit...

32:39.480 --> 32:40.360
Stay...

32:41.720 --> 32:42.560
here.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.360
Ow!

32:55.280 --> 32:56.640
You give that back right now.

32:56.680 --> 32:57.760
Don't come near me.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.520
You have no idea
what you're messing with.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.520
I need your help.

33:01.560 --> 33:02.360
Give it back.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.840
Stay away!

33:03.880 --> 33:05.040
Give it back.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.520
The force of that stone

33:06.560 --> 33:09.000
is too dark
for you to comprehend.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.120
Now...

33:10.160 --> 33:11.160
Now.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.040
What have you done?

33:23.240 --> 33:25.160
Oh, so you're going
to cut me open

33:25.200 --> 33:26.560
to get your stone...

33:26.600 --> 33:27.840
a small girl.

33:27.880 --> 33:33.480
Do you have any idea
the power I'm up against?

33:33.520 --> 33:35.360
Lokka doesn't play games.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.400
If you're going
to do it,

33:37.440 --> 33:39.000
do it!

33:42.200 --> 33:44.400
My father's in the camp.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.760
I've seen him.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.920
They've hurt him, badly.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.000
No, no, no...

33:50.040 --> 33:51.720
I'll give you back your stone,

33:51.760 --> 33:55.960
but I have to get him out
before they kill him.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.120
Please help me.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.680
I should have cut your throat
first time I saw you.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.520
Please...

34:14.960 --> 34:17.199
So, guys, there's been
a slight change of plans.

34:17.239 --> 34:19.080
-Why?
-For what?

34:22.880 --> 34:24.000
I'm going
to tell you a story.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.800
It's a story about
an old friend of mine,

34:26.840 --> 34:28.560
a friend from below,

34:28.600 --> 34:31.440
from the hottest, molten depths
of Hell.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.880
His name...

34:37.840 --> 34:40.000
His name...

34:40.040 --> 34:41.440
is Pwykka.

34:49.239 --> 34:50.880
Do you remember that soldier,

34:50.920 --> 34:52.280
the one that brought me
the message?

34:52.320 --> 34:55.000
The one you buried alive?

34:57.080 --> 34:58.120
My errand boy.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.920
I sent him off
with a message.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.560
Turns out,
he was a good errand boy,

35:07.600 --> 35:09.800
because when I got
to the place,

35:09.840 --> 35:12.000
they were waiting for me,
our friends.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.880
We talked.
I made them an offer...

35:15.920 --> 35:18.600
in exchange for, um...
something.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.400
What did you offer them?

35:21.440 --> 35:24.000
Well, the one thing
nature cares about...

35:24.040 --> 35:26.160
certitude.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.800
And what did they offer you?

35:29.880 --> 35:31.120
Well,
the one thing I care about...

35:31.160 --> 35:32.240
victory.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.000
At what cost?

35:34.040 --> 35:35.680
Well, the going rate...

35:35.720 --> 35:38.120
which, in this war,
is any cost whatsoever.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.040
You've made a mistake.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.440
A calculated risk.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.920
The men are spooked
enough as it is.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.280
They think we're
at war with ghosts.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.440
We've got mutiny and
rebellion up the arse.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.440
We are on the brink,

36:01.480 --> 36:02.600
and you're out there

36:02.640 --> 36:05.160
playing ghouls
and fucking goblins.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.280
We go back a long way,
you and I.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.240
You're my closest friend.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.240
Don't ever question
my authority again,

36:23.280 --> 36:24.360
or you'll regret it.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.080
Do you understand?

36:36.760 --> 36:38.160
Yes...

36:38.200 --> 36:39.920
sir.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.440
You know Caesar's
mistake?

36:54.040 --> 36:56.000
He thought it was all about
forts and ramparts...

36:56.040 --> 36:58.200
numbers...

37:00.560 --> 37:02.400
Tactics.

37:04.560 --> 37:05.720
You don't defeat
these people

37:05.760 --> 37:08.480
by fighting their warriors.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.720
You defeat them
by fighting their gods.

37:18.600 --> 37:21.360
It's their gods
you've got to kill.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.480
Someone approaching!

37:26.520 --> 37:29.640
Sounds like we have visitors.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.360
Stations!
Sound the alarm!

37:32.400 --> 37:34.960
The fuck...

37:38.080 --> 37:39.880
Back off!

37:41.280 --> 37:43.120
We are all ghosts.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.680
All of us...

37:45.720 --> 37:47.880
everyone.

37:47.920 --> 37:48.920
We are the dead.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.520
We are the dead!

37:52.560 --> 37:55.000
We are the dead!

37:57.840 --> 37:59.560
Sorcery!

37:59.600 --> 38:00.920
We don't
belong here!

38:02.200 --> 38:03.360
He's cursed us all.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.120
We need to go home!

38:09.600 --> 38:10.720
It worked.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.640
This is our chance.

38:12.680 --> 38:13.840
Go. Hurry!

38:13.880 --> 38:15.400
Go, go, go!

38:23.280 --> 38:24.280
Where am I?

38:26.400 --> 38:28.040
Fuck!

38:31.440 --> 38:32.240
You're on your own.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.480
What?

38:33.520 --> 38:35.440
You said,
"get me inside."

38:35.480 --> 38:36.280
There's something
I need to do.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.280
Father.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.160
Father, it's me.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.160
Cait? Cait!

38:59.200 --> 39:00.800
I'm here.
I'm here.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.680
I need you
to stay here.

39:03.720 --> 39:04.840
Where
are you going?

39:05.920 --> 39:06.880
Be careful!

39:06.920 --> 39:08.360
No! No time!

39:08.400 --> 39:09.200
Go! Go with
your father.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.440
Hurry!

39:10.480 --> 39:11.320
Go! Go now!

39:11.360 --> 39:12.720
Come here.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.440
He brought this on us!

39:19.480 --> 39:20.920
He cursed us all!

39:26.040 --> 39:28.640
Any man who doesn't want
to see his home again,

39:28.680 --> 39:31.280
step forward
and run me through...

39:35.440 --> 39:37.880
or...
all at once.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.080
Come.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.000
You afraid?

39:56.360 --> 39:58.280
Our gods protect us,

39:58.320 --> 40:00.200
and I protect you...

40:02.280 --> 40:03.480
your general,

40:03.520 --> 40:06.880
Aulus Plautius,
a Roman, as you are Romans.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.640
Not men.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.560
Not scared children.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.000
Romans.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.360
You go back to your tents.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.520
Now.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.240
Do as I command.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.520
You're alive,
Father.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.480
Where is Islene?
Is she safe?

41:27.080 --> 41:28.920
Is Islene safe?

41:30.840 --> 41:32.400
She's safe, Father.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.720
Thanks to the gods.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.840
Islene sent you,
didn't she?

41:42.880 --> 41:44.640
She sent me.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.800
We're safe.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.480
They've sent for us.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.360
Mighty Lokka.

43:10.640 --> 43:12.360
We are rising.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.080
We are rising.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.800
The voices were clear.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.920
Are you ready to follow
the will of the gods?

43:27.960 --> 43:30.080
But if loving my mother
angers the gods,

43:30.120 --> 43:31.320
they are no gods of mine.

43:31.360 --> 43:35.440
You just made
a very big decision.

43:35.480 --> 43:38.760
Now the gods will make theirs.
