00:05.638 --> 00:08.173
- Honey.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
- Hi.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.346
- Hey.

00:19.252 --> 00:22.354
I'm awake, right?

00:22.356 --> 00:25.457
I have these dreams sometimes.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.593
- I'm helen from tupperware.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.029
- Yep, that's one of them.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.400
- Oh, ray,
I'm so glad you're home.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.569
Listen, you got to help me
get set up for this part.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.605
- Oh, oh, that thing is tonight?

00:39.607 --> 00:41.140
- That thing?

00:41.142 --> 00:43.409
Ray, I told you about this party
again this morning.

00:43.411 --> 00:46.145
You know, you never listen
to anything I say.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.648
- Well, you say a lot.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.483
- Who are the pizzas for?

00:51.485 --> 00:54.253
- See, here's the funny thing.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.055
- Ray.

00:56.057 --> 00:59.491
- A couple of the guys might be
coming over to watch the fight,

00:59.493 --> 01:02.227
Maybe, might be.

01:02.229 --> 01:06.565
- Ray, I have been planning
this tupperware party for weeks.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.700
- But, look,
the fight's only tonight.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.770
I mean, come on, you can
get plastic jugs anytime.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.406
- That's not a jug.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.275
That's our innovative
pick-a-deli.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.510
It's easy lift-up strainer
lets you select a pickle

01:18.512 --> 01:22.081
Without getting
your fingers wet.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.416
- Mm.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.653
We're been living like animals.

01:33.726 --> 01:36.095
- Ray, come on.
Don't ruin tonight for me.

01:36.097 --> 01:38.197
I'm only doin' this
to see my friends for once

01:38.199 --> 01:40.099
And to have a little fun.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.233
- And to find out
what's on the cutting edge

01:41.235 --> 01:42.234
Of food storage systems.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.802
- Right.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.771
[doorbell rings]

01:45.773 --> 01:46.839
- Okay.

01:46.841 --> 01:47.840
- Hey!

01:47.842 --> 01:49.608
- Hi.
- Hi, come on in.

01:49.610 --> 01:53.612
- Yeah, hi.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.613
- Hey, ray.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.814
- Ray, very classy.

01:55.816 --> 01:59.318
Pay-per-view and dates.

02:00.854 --> 02:05.224
- Do I pick them,
or do they pick me?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.725
- Are these guys staying?

02:06.727 --> 02:08.627
- No, they're only here
to watch the fight,

02:08.629 --> 02:10.729
Which they will be watching
from upstairs in the bedroom.

02:10.731 --> 02:11.730
- The bedroom?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.633
Ooh, the hot zone!

02:18.538 --> 02:20.839
- All right,
now, listen, ray.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.541
Here's the deal:
I'm letting your friends stay.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.909
- Thank you.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.278
- All right, but they're
not allowed to touch anything.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.480
I don't want them looking
in the closet or in the drawers.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.781
I don't want them
trying on my shoes.

02:29.783 --> 02:33.819
[doorbell rings]

02:33.821 --> 02:35.654
- Hi, ray.
- Hi. Hi.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.556
- Hi, ray.
- Hello.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.592
- What's with the broads?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.261
- Yeah. All right,
here's what's gonna happen:

02:42.263 --> 02:43.662
Guys upstairs for the fight,

02:43.664 --> 02:45.497
And ladies down here
for your crap.

02:45.499 --> 02:49.568
- All right.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.736
- Let's go.
Ready?

02:50.738 --> 02:51.770
- Yeah, yeah.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.839
Just want to
say good-bye to amy.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.507
- Bye, honey.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.542
Have fun.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.481
- See ya later, amy.

03:05.451 --> 03:08.420
- Okay, girls, it's time
to play barnyard bingo.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.588
All: Oh!

03:09.590 --> 03:11.490
- Winner gets a melon baller.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.392
- Bingo!
That's what I need.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.361
- Everybody think of your
favorite barnyard animal.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.362
- Horse.
- Uh, duck.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.664
- Deb, deb,
deb, deb.

03:18.666 --> 03:23.669
Chicken.
Chicken.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.672
- Raymond, I got
your crab and artichoke dip

03:26.674 --> 03:28.574
For your sports thing.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.776
Oh, hi.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.211
What's all this?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.645
- Big tupperware party.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.581
- Tupperware?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.883
Debra's giving
a tupperware party?

03:37.885 --> 03:44.356
Oh, I didn't know
anything about this.

03:44.358 --> 03:47.226
- Ray, I told you
to invite your mother.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.293
Did you forget?

04:01.774 --> 04:02.708
- Yes, I did.

04:05.378 --> 04:06.912
- Sorry, marie.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.480
Listen, just have a seat.
I'll get you a soda.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.715
- Okay.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.715
- Yeah,
and we're playing a game.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.884
You have to think of your
favorite barnyard animal.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.519
- Okay.

04:14.521 --> 04:17.623
Oh, I like that movie "babe"
with the talking pig.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.559
I'll be that.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.394
What do you think,
debra?

04:22.396 --> 04:25.264
- I'm gonna
get the sodas.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.770
- Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.739
I totally forgot
that you told me to invite her.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.340
- You didn't forget.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.508
I never told you
to invite her

04:36.510 --> 04:37.809
Because
I didn't want her here.

04:41.748 --> 04:45.651
- So this wasn't my fault.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.885
- I just can't believe this.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.754
I can't have one night
with my friends

04:48.756 --> 04:51.790
Without her here butting in
and making me crazy.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.458
- Yeah, well,
what are you gonna do,

04:53.460 --> 04:56.962
Call off the party
and maybe let my friends

04:56.964 --> 05:01.333
Come down and watch
the fight on the big tv?

05:01.335 --> 05:02.701
- No, ray. No, no.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.603
I'm just gonna
make the best of this.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.671
I mean,
I have my friends here,

05:05.673 --> 05:06.671
And, I don't know,

05:06.673 --> 05:08.807
Maybe your mother will
buy a lot of tupperware.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.376
- That's the spirit.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.511
Come on, debra.
We need you.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.512
You're our chicken.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.614
- Okay.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.050
Cocka-freakin'-doodle do.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.753
- So bernie says to me,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.689
"all right, I'm gonna
get the curtain rods

05:23.691 --> 05:24.923
For the bay windows."

05:24.925 --> 05:27.392
What, do you think
he measures it first? No.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.961
He says to me,
"I can eyeball it."

05:29.963 --> 05:32.531
- Why don't men
ever want to measure anything?

05:32.533 --> 05:33.899
- Why do you think?

05:33.901 --> 05:37.903
[laughter]

05:37.905 --> 05:41.473
- Why?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.041
- Anyway, I got to tell ya,

05:43.043 --> 05:48.347
He had to go back to that
hardware store 12 times.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.782
- 12 times
to buy curtain rods?

05:50.784 --> 05:53.018
Maybe bernie's
fooling around.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.822
- [laughs weakly]

05:56.824 --> 05:59.024
I have to use your phone.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.364
- Okay,
for more free tupperware,

06:05.366 --> 06:06.365
It's time to play

06:06.367 --> 06:07.632
"guess whose nightie?"

06:07.634 --> 06:10.702
[all whooping]

06:10.704 --> 06:12.404
Did everybody put
their nightie in the bag?

06:12.406 --> 06:13.472
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.973
- No,
I didn't bring one.

06:14.975 --> 06:18.643
I wasn't told
about the party.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.978
- Well,
why don't you pick first?

06:19.980 --> 06:22.881
- Okay.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.616
Ooh!

06:24.618 --> 06:26.418
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

06:26.420 --> 06:27.452
- I guess amy.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.920
- Yes!

06:28.922 --> 06:30.889
- Amy? No.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.425
- Well, I never wear it.

06:33.427 --> 06:38.397
Actually, I bought it
special for this game.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.098
Really.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.735
Robert's never seen it.

06:43.737 --> 06:48.507
I'm sorry.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.841
- Well, let's pick again.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.743
- Oh, okay.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.813
Oh, my,
what is this?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.548
- Marie,
it's not your turn.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.650
You had your turn
already.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.651
[fabric tears]
- no!

06:59.653 --> 07:01.019
I wore that
on my honeymoon.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.587
- I'm sorry, gayle.
I'm so sorry.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.456
I could just
put it back to--

07:04.458 --> 07:05.624
- Bernie's not home.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.192
I called the office.
I called nemo's.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.693
Where is he?

07:08.695 --> 07:12.497
- Oh, my god,
I was only joking, dear.

07:12.499 --> 07:13.598
I never would
have said anything

07:13.600 --> 07:16.868
If I thought
he was cheating.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.203
- You call that
a fight?

07:18.205 --> 07:20.005
- Fight?
I thought those two guys

07:20.007 --> 07:24.443
Were gonna skip out of the ring
and go antiquing.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.577
- Want to catch
a good fight?

07:25.579 --> 07:26.678
Wait'll debra
sees our bedspread.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.549
- Good night,
ladies.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.751
Anybody need a ride?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.519
- What's your hurry?
Stay a while.

07:34.521 --> 07:35.754
I made my special dip.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.955
- Ray.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.890
- Ma,
we've eaten already, really.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.225
- Well,
what about all this food

07:40.227 --> 07:42.027
That debra made
that nobody touched?

07:42.029 --> 07:47.132
What are these, sandwiches?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.201
- Mrs. Barone,
I don't know what's in this dip,

07:49.203 --> 07:52.003
But if you
weren't married...

07:52.005 --> 07:54.172
- Take her.
I'll throw in the dip.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.178
- I'm sorry, debra.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.179
I have to go.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.180
- Oh, no.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.215
- Hey, tell bernie
I said "hi."

08:03.217 --> 08:05.150
- Yeah, right!

08:05.152 --> 08:06.751
- Linda...

08:06.753 --> 08:07.853
- Come on, guys. Sit down.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.087
- Marie,
I'm sure ray's friends

08:09.089 --> 08:11.156
Are not interested
in tupperware.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.525
- Actually, I could use
some new ice trays.

08:13.527 --> 08:17.662
My cubes smell.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.831
- Amy, what is this
doin' here?

08:19.833 --> 08:24.236
Did ma see this?

08:24.238 --> 08:25.770
- Holy crap!

08:25.772 --> 08:27.172
It's a whole bag
of nighties.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.141
- No, frank, that--

08:30.143 --> 08:31.943
It's for a game.
Just--

08:31.945 --> 08:35.013
- I'm in!

08:35.015 --> 08:38.016
- You know, I should
probably get going too.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.718
- Oh, please.
Now, wait. Wait.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.020
There's still lots
of free stuff here.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.889
Well, at least
take catalogs!

08:43.891 --> 08:47.092
This territory blows.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.261
- Gayle, please,
can't you stay?

08:49.263 --> 08:51.830
You know, these guys
are leavin' in just a minute.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.165
Oh, god, this is
not what I wanted!

08:54.167 --> 08:56.868
- Of course it isn't, dear.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.905
Nobody wants
to give a bad party.

09:09.315 --> 09:12.851
- Hey, that tupperware stuff
is pretty good.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.554
I just did my whole back
with that scrub brush.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.822
- That's for fruit.

09:20.092 --> 09:24.663
- You might want
to rinse that.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.997
Still mad
about the party?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.632
- No, I'm fine.

09:27.634 --> 09:28.934
- Good.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.168
What's that
you're writin' there?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.704
- A letter to your mother.

09:39.879 --> 09:43.615
- [quietly]
why?

09:43.617 --> 09:47.152
- Well, to start with,
she ruined my party.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.320
- You're writing that?

09:48.322 --> 09:49.988
- Yep.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.690
- Yeah, but it's for therapy.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.291
You're not gonna send it.
- Oh, I'm sending it.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.594
- No! No! No! No!

09:55.596 --> 09:57.596
Stop and listen
for a second.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.064
Come on,
if anybody ruined the party,

09:59.066 --> 10:00.665
It was the guys,
and they were my fault.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.968
So you should write me.
Write me a letter.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.236
- No, ray, I can't keep
blaming her for everything

10:05.238 --> 10:06.236
If I've never been
honest with her,

10:06.238 --> 10:09.307
And I have never actually
told her how she makes me feel

10:09.309 --> 10:11.309
When she does the things
that she does.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.979
- But you don't
put that in writing.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.081
Oh, no! No!

10:16.083 --> 10:19.150
If it's in writing, then
you can't deny it, you know?

10:19.152 --> 10:20.785
You can't
say things like,

10:20.787 --> 10:22.320
"you didn't hear me right,"

10:22.322 --> 10:25.156
Or "I didn't say that.
You must have misunderstood,"

10:25.158 --> 10:26.157
Because there it is.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.225
It's in writing.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.727
- You know,
if it were up to you,

10:28.729 --> 10:30.328
You'd have me
do nothing.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.964
- Hey, let's not
underestimate nothing.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.899
- No, no, ray,
I'm not spending

10:34.901 --> 10:36.234
The rest
of my life this way,

10:36.236 --> 10:37.669
With your mother saying
she's sorry

10:37.671 --> 10:38.937
That you ever married me.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.939
- She's never said that.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.008
- She doesn't
have to say it to say it.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.242
Everything
she does says it.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.677
- Like what?

10:45.679 --> 10:47.679
- Like when she rewashes
the kids' clothes.

10:47.681 --> 10:48.980
- Okay.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.383
- Yeah, and then she
rewashes the kids.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.184
- Look, look,

10:53.186 --> 10:57.122
All that stuff my mom does,
that's how she helps.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.291
- No, no, ray,
that's how she criticizes.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.794
Only good can come
from this letter,

11:02.796 --> 11:03.995
And I'm doin' it.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.165
- Mmm.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.904
[whining]

11:17.276 --> 11:19.411
[whines]

11:25.051 --> 11:26.384
No, no,
don't do it.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.953
Think it over.
- Let go! Let go of the pad!

11:28.955 --> 11:31.823
Get off that!

11:31.825 --> 11:33.191
Stop it.

11:33.193 --> 11:37.062
- I had to try.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.265
- You know what
you could try, ray?

11:40.267 --> 11:43.968
You could try supporting me.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.036
- All right,
all right.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.705
Okay, you're right.

11:46.707 --> 11:47.906
You're right.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.107
I am. I am.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.475
I'm gonna
support you.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.244
Look, just 'cause
I can't confront my mother

11:53.246 --> 11:56.715
Doesn't mean I should
stop you from doing it.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.750
- Thank you, ray.

11:58.752 --> 11:59.818
I appreciate it.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.787
I do.

12:02.789 --> 12:03.788
[sighs]

12:03.790 --> 12:04.489
You know what I need?

12:04.491 --> 12:05.890
- A hug?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.959
- More paper.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.201
- Hey.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.036
- Hey, ray.
- Oh, hi, dear.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.337
Want some waffles?

12:19.339 --> 12:22.807
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.143
Soooo...

12:25.145 --> 12:29.280
You guys get your mail yet?

12:29.282 --> 12:30.348
- No, why?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.817
- Because I
was just wondering,

12:32.819 --> 12:34.385
Because we didn't
get ours either, you know,

12:34.387 --> 12:37.489
And sometimes we might
get something of yours,

12:37.491 --> 12:40.024
And you might get
something of ours.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.994
- What do you get of mine?

12:42.996 --> 12:45.330
- You know, I don't know,
just junk mail.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.165
- Like what?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.968
- Whatever.
Uh, flyers and coupons.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.503
- Where are they?

12:51.505 --> 12:52.937
- I throw them out.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.172
- You throw out coupons?

12:54.174 --> 12:55.774
That's money!

12:55.776 --> 12:57.442
- Look, I'm just--
all I'm saying

12:57.444 --> 12:59.911
Is that you might
get some of my mail.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.813
- Well, how much
were the coupons for?

13:01.815 --> 13:03.081
- I don't know!

13:03.083 --> 13:04.549
- Jeez aloo!

13:04.551 --> 13:06.151
Did you get the one
for carpet cleaning?

13:06.153 --> 13:07.485
- I don't know. Maybe.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.387
- That's a $10 coupon!

13:09.389 --> 13:10.789
I was looking
for that one!

13:10.791 --> 13:12.290
- All right, look, dad,
I'll give you $20

13:12.292 --> 13:14.359
If you stop talking
about this.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.560
- You think
I won't take it.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.195
I'll take it!
- I'll give it to ya!

13:17.197 --> 13:19.430
- It would teach you
a lesson! Come on!

13:19.432 --> 13:21.533
- No, no! You're not
taking his money!

13:21.535 --> 13:23.067
- I'm gonna take it,

13:23.069 --> 13:24.903
Because how else
is he gonna learn?

13:24.905 --> 13:27.972
He's got to stop
throwing out people's mail!

13:27.974 --> 13:29.941
- Well,
that's not how you do it.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.576
If you want to
teach him a lesson,

13:31.578 --> 13:33.945
You make him clean
the carpet himself.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.480
That he'll remember.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.817
You want boysenberry
or maple syrup, dear?

13:38.819 --> 13:40.819
- Maple.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.353
- Hey.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.822
Waffles?

13:43.824 --> 13:45.123
- Yeah, how many?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.091
- Six, boysenberry.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.459
- Is that the mail?

13:48.461 --> 13:49.459
- I'll get it
for you, dad.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.962
- Uhp, buhp, buhp,
buhp, buhp, buhp.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.998
Hands off, sticky fingers.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.467
Crap...Crap...

13:56.469 --> 13:58.603
Crap...
Crap...

13:58.605 --> 14:01.506
Coupon!

14:01.508 --> 14:04.509
Here's one
that made it through.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.618
Marie, do we need
our chimney swept?

14:13.620 --> 14:14.618
- No.

14:14.620 --> 14:18.223
- Here. This is
for your collection.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.024
- Hey, marie.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.559
This is a letter for you.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.361
- Oh, how nice.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.963
- Hey, ma, are we eatin'
or readin'?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.297
- Oh.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.299
Oh, this is odd.
It's from debra.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.934
- Ah! You know what that is?

14:29.936 --> 14:31.903
That's the invitation
to the tupperware party,

14:31.905 --> 14:33.638
But you already went,
and you had a good time.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.873
- No, no, no, no.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.074
That's not
an invitation.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.242
No, that's a letter.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.309
- It's an invitation.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.544
It's got a lot of pages
like this

14:39.546 --> 14:41.379
Because it has
directions to our house.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.914
- Now, come on.

14:42.916 --> 14:46.484
- Dad!

14:46.486 --> 14:48.219
- This is your mother's mail.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.555
What is wrong with you?

14:52.992 --> 14:56.494
"dear marie,

14:56.496 --> 14:59.931
This letter has been
a long time coming."

14:59.933 --> 15:01.032
- [chuckles]

15:01.034 --> 15:04.369
It must be a thank-you note.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.304
- Oh, yeah?
[chuckles]

15:06.306 --> 15:07.639
- All right, dad,
give it to me now.

15:07.641 --> 15:10.408
- No, no, no, no, no.
What does it say?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.410
- "for eight years now,

15:12.412 --> 15:14.279
"I've held my tongue

15:14.281 --> 15:18.583
"and never told you
how hurtful and destructive

15:18.585 --> 15:21.586
Your behavior
can sometimes be."

15:21.588 --> 15:24.455
- Oh, my god.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.931
- I have to go.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.165
- Here. Sit down.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.434
- Ma, look,
it's between you and debra,

15:36.436 --> 15:37.568
And you should go over
there

15:37.570 --> 15:40.471
And read that yourself
and let me out.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.640
- We have no secrets
in this family.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.975
Keep reading, frank.

15:43.977 --> 15:47.345
- With pleasure.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.547
"just because
we are family

15:49.549 --> 15:51.983
"and happen
also to be neighbors

15:51.985 --> 15:55.720
"does not give you the right
to constantly interfere

15:55.722 --> 15:58.423
In every aspect
of my life..."

15:58.425 --> 16:00.525
[laughs]

16:00.527 --> 16:02.427
[coughs]
ahem.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.461
Ahem.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.396
[coughing]

16:05.398 --> 16:07.165
"from raising my children

16:07.167 --> 16:09.701
To my choice
of liquid fabric softener."

16:09.703 --> 16:11.602
- I want you guys
to know right now

16:11.604 --> 16:14.272
That debra
has a drinking problem.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.177
- Keep reading.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.079
Go on, keep reading.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.147
- Stop it!

16:23.149 --> 16:26.217
"I'm sure you
don't even realize

16:26.219 --> 16:31.089
When you're being overbearing,
critical, and intrusive."

16:31.091 --> 16:34.192
Is this a petition?

16:34.194 --> 16:37.695
Where do I sign?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.731
- All right, all right.
I've heard enough.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.300
- Oh, ma. Mom.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.109
- "dear...

16:51.111 --> 16:52.510
Debra..."

16:52.512 --> 16:55.213
- Oh, no, ma,
not another letter, please.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.215
- I'm intrusive?

16:57.217 --> 16:58.516
Debra's not the only one

16:58.518 --> 17:01.085
Who can throw around
fancy words.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.525
Where's my dictionary?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.360
- Oh, ma, stop.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.663
Ma, she didn't mean it.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.700
- Hi, uh, did you guys
happen to get the--

17:15.702 --> 17:18.369
- Mail? Oh, yeah.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.041
- Ray, did everybody
read that?

17:23.043 --> 17:25.643
- You're my favorite writer.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.157
- Hello, debra.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.725
- Hello, marie.

17:40.727 --> 17:45.129
- I got your special delivery.

17:45.131 --> 17:48.299
- Marie, I'm sorry.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.268
It was a mistake
to send that letter.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.703
- Now? You say that now?

17:55.641 --> 17:59.110
I got to tell you,
your timing sucks.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.753
- I should have just talked
to you face-to-face.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.255
- Go ahead.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.490
- Oh.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.092
- I've dealt with my fair share

18:14.094 --> 18:15.092
Of domestic disputes,

18:15.094 --> 18:17.562
And everyone should know
that this is a high risk--

18:17.564 --> 18:18.629
- Eat your waffles,
robbie.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.164
- All right.

18:25.704 --> 18:29.373
- Look, marie, I'm sorry
that the letter upset you.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.243
When I wrote it,
I was very angry.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.378
- And drunk.

18:41.887 --> 18:45.223
- It's just that sometimes
you're very hard to talk to,

18:45.225 --> 18:47.592
And so I thought I could
say it better in a letter.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.294
- I think you said it
very clearly, debra.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.629
You think,
among other things,

18:51.631 --> 18:54.198
That I'm intrusive,
critical.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.534
- Overbearing.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.842
- I have always known that
you felt that way about me.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.677
You think
I'm all those things.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.479
Well, maybe
I wouldn't be that way

19:08.481 --> 19:10.615
If I was welcome
in your house.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.216
- But, marie,
don't you see?

19:12.218 --> 19:14.552
You're over all the time.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.221
You don't give me a chance
to welcome you.

19:17.223 --> 19:20.391
- Well, I-I-I-I...

19:23.629 --> 19:26.931
Okay, maybe I am
those things sometimes,

19:26.933 --> 19:28.633
But that's just because

19:28.635 --> 19:31.536
That's my way of trying
to make us a family.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.204
That's all I ever want.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.207
- Well, that is all
I want too

19:36.209 --> 19:40.444
Is for us to be a family,
a real family.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.246
- But I always thought

19:42.248 --> 19:44.549
That you didn't like
my being in your family.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.385
- I thought you didn't
like me being in your family.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.287
- Why would you say that?

19:49.289 --> 19:54.559
- Well, you know when you
bring food over to the house?

19:54.561 --> 19:57.461
- I do it because I care.

19:57.463 --> 20:01.465
- Oh, but, see, I feel
like that's a criticism,

20:01.467 --> 20:04.702
You know, like you're saying
I'm not as good as you.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.838
- You don't have to be
as good as me.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.414
I love you
for what you are.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.850
- I love you too.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.353
- Oh, I'm so glad we talked.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.289
- Yeah, me too.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.757
You know what?

20:26.759 --> 20:28.693
The tupperware's in,
and it's over at that house.

20:28.695 --> 20:29.894
You want to come over
and get yours?

20:29.896 --> 20:31.462
- Oh, I'd love to, honey.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.397
Oh, and the little scraper
for potato.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.832
- Yeah. That's in.
- Ooh, I love that.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.634
- You got to show me
how to make those potatoes.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.336
- I will, and I'll show you
how to freeze them.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.853
- What in hell's bathroom
was that?

21:01.727 --> 21:06.030
- I-I think it was a fight.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.701
- That's a fight?

21:10.703 --> 21:15.339
- You know, like,
uh, a woman's fight.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.742
- I'm glad we didn't order
that on pay-per-view.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.816
- Robert, are you crying?

21:25.818 --> 21:27.585
- No, no.

21:40.399 --> 21:41.899
- See, ray, that letter

21:41.901 --> 21:44.335
Actually made your mother
and I closer.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.337
- I told you
not to send it.

21:50.342 --> 21:52.576
- Look, you don't understand.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.680
We had to have that blowout
to get past it,

21:55.682 --> 21:58.683
And now that we did the letter
and it's behind us,

21:58.685 --> 22:01.686
We can move on.

22:01.688 --> 22:05.856
- Frank, what's debra's letter
doing in the garbage?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.458
- You read it already.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.528
- You don't throw this away.

22:10.530 --> 22:15.066
Not ever.

22:15.068 --> 22:18.569
Not...Ever.
