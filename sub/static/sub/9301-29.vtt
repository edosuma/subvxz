WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:27.159 --> 01:30.390
Grr, please, Great Skeletor...

01:30.862 --> 01:32.762
Give me one more chance.

01:33.532 --> 01:34.966
I beg you. Don't...

01:34.991 --> 01:38.084
Don't send me away from Snake Mountain.

01:40.072 --> 01:42.302
Silence, you furry fool.

01:42.441 --> 01:43.611
I've had it with your whining

01:43.636 --> 01:45.195
and bumbling.

01:45.777 --> 01:48.170
You're finished here, do you understand?
Cast out.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.362
Banished.

01:49.481 --> 01:52.075
Say, what's Beast Man done, anyway?

01:52.851 --> 01:54.806
Nothing. Skeletor's had one too

01:54.831 --> 01:56.888
many defeats from He-Man and...

01:56.888 --> 01:59.755
he's taking it out on poor old fuzz-face.

01:59.958 --> 02:01.051
Just be grateful,

02:01.076 --> 02:02.710
that's not you down there.

02:03.261 --> 02:05.354
Your whip, Beast Man.

02:13.405 --> 02:16.397
And finally,
your seat at the council table.

02:19.478 --> 02:22.057
Go, and don't let me see your

02:22.082 --> 02:24.838
mangy hide around here again.

02:26.852 --> 02:29.343
Alright, I'll go...

02:30.088 --> 02:32.022
but I'll be back.

02:32.324 --> 02:34.758
Oh, you will, will you?

02:34.960 --> 02:37.142
Yes! I'll show you all,

02:37.167 --> 02:40.012
the true power of Beast Man.

02:40.832 --> 02:44.165
You haven't seen the last...

02:44.270 --> 02:45.270
of meee.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.618
There, all the adjustments are done.

03:04.856 --> 03:06.870
The Attak Trak's ready for the

03:06.895 --> 03:08.976
king's royal tour of Eternia.

03:09.194 --> 03:09.945
That's great.

03:09.970 --> 03:11.413
When do we get started?

03:11.596 --> 03:13.712
We, don't.
The king will be going

03:13.737 --> 03:16.201
alone on this tour,
accompanied only...

03:16.201 --> 03:17.592
by me and his mightiest,

03:17.617 --> 03:18.955
most courageous warrior.

03:19.890 --> 03:20.890
Ahem!

03:21.406 --> 03:23.542
You, Prince Adam?
-Well, I'm hoping he picks me...

03:23.542 --> 03:25.533
-as his guard.
-No fair.

03:25.811 --> 03:27.812
I wanna go too.
I'm real helpful.

03:29.447 --> 03:32.314
You can be a big help by
staying out of the way.

03:32.484 --> 03:35.385
But I won't cause any trouble, I promise.

03:35.787 --> 03:36.845
Whoops!

03:39.145 --> 03:40.145
Yipe!

03:40.392 --> 03:42.292
-Orko? -He's trapped inside.

03:48.133 --> 03:49.361
Let me out!

03:49.601 --> 03:50.832
Voice scan: Negative.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.321
You are not recognized.

03:52.504 --> 03:53.698
You are an intruder.

03:53.905 --> 03:56.840
Which one is the turn off switch?

04:04.583 --> 04:06.175
Oh, stop!
Stop!

04:06.685 --> 04:09.210
I think we need a little help.

04:09.454 --> 04:11.752
By the power of Grayskull!

04:18.129 --> 04:22.259
I have the power!

04:33.612 --> 04:35.409
What's going on around here, Duncan?

04:38.850 --> 04:41.614
We're having some trouble
with the Attack Trak, Sire,

04:41.853 --> 04:43.718
but He-Man is taking care of it.

05:03.508 --> 05:04.839
He-Man!

05:05.944 --> 05:07.479
Attack Trak, this is He-Man.

05:07.479 --> 05:10.004
Cease all functions immediately.

05:10.181 --> 05:11.739
Voice scan: Positive.

05:12.017 --> 05:13.285
He-Man: Confirmed.

05:13.285 --> 05:15.048
All functions: Ceased.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.786
Last stop.
Everybody out.

05:24.696 --> 05:27.164
You said you wanted to help?

05:33.705 --> 05:34.501
He-Man...

05:35.607 --> 05:37.387
I saw how you rescued Orko.

05:37.412 --> 05:38.862
That was very brave.

05:38.977 --> 05:40.032
Thank you, Sire.

05:40.057 --> 05:42.264
I'm just glad that
no one got hurt.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.278
You do a great service to
Eternia, young man.

05:45.517 --> 05:48.384
We are proud,
you are on our side.

05:48.553 --> 05:49.679
Thank you, Your Majesty.

05:52.190 --> 05:54.818
So you still think you'll
be the king's escort, eh?

05:55.026 --> 05:56.027
Sure. Why not?

05:56.027 --> 05:58.723
Well, sometimes,
he hasn't been too pleased with you.

05:58.930 --> 06:01.833
You know, as Adam,
I may act like a goof now and then but...

06:01.833 --> 06:03.868
well that's only to keep my secret...

06:03.868 --> 06:05.838
Besides,
I'd never really do anything,

06:05.863 --> 06:07.505
to make my father ashamed of me.

06:07.505 --> 06:09.996
Hmm, I hope he knows that.

06:15.013 --> 06:16.973
Adam, Duncan, I called you in to

06:16.998 --> 06:18.984
tell you that I have made the choice for...

06:18.984 --> 06:21.145
My honor guard escort.

06:21.386 --> 06:24.556
The young man I've selected has
won the admiration of myself...

06:24.556 --> 06:27.058
and our people many times over.

06:27.058 --> 06:28.582
-He-Man.
-He-Man?

06:28.860 --> 06:32.057
Duncan, you've had great
success in summoning He-Man before.

06:32.330 --> 06:35.197
Would you please contact him now?
-Of course, Your Majesty.

06:35.433 --> 06:36.301
But father I...

06:36.301 --> 06:39.327
Well, I thought you and I
might make this trip together.

06:39.771 --> 06:40.829
Really, Adam?

06:41.072 --> 06:43.666
But you've never shown any
interest in state affairs.

06:43.875 --> 06:46.343
Sorry, son.
I'm afraid on this trip...

06:46.578 --> 06:47.744
I'll need someone,

06:47.769 --> 06:50.231
a bit more experienced and reliable.

06:50.782 --> 06:52.113
I see.

07:01.092 --> 07:02.810
You seem troubled, Adam.

07:02.835 --> 07:04.051
How can I help?

07:04.262 --> 07:06.898
For a long time,
I've had the power of He-Man but...

07:06.898 --> 07:10.061
to keep that power a
secret, I've had to pretend...

07:10.335 --> 07:12.929
you know,
to be careless and irresponsible.

07:13.204 --> 07:16.173
More than anything,
I want to give up that disguise...

07:16.374 --> 07:18.501
and make my father proud of me.

07:18.843 --> 07:20.936
I understand your sorrow, Adam.

07:21.379 --> 07:23.014
But you must also recognize...

07:23.014 --> 07:25.847
the responsibility your power brings.

07:26.117 --> 07:28.014
If Skeletor or any of He-Man's

07:28.039 --> 07:30.441
other enemies learned your secret...

07:30.822 --> 07:33.036
they would not rest, until they had

07:33.061 --> 07:35.215
destroyed you or the ones you love.

07:35.660 --> 07:38.196
Well,
I can't endanger my family...

07:38.196 --> 07:39.674
but I can make my father respect

07:39.699 --> 07:41.314
me without telling him my secret.

07:41.566 --> 07:45.525
You must do what you think is right, Adam.
But be careful.

07:50.575 --> 07:54.841
So, after all those years of service...

07:55.880 --> 08:00.817
Skeletor, just throws me out.

08:06.825 --> 08:09.453
Why, that skull-faced creep.

08:10.061 --> 08:12.256
Where does he come off pushing me around?

08:15.467 --> 08:17.203
I'm still Beast Man, right?

08:17.737 --> 08:19.737
The master of all the animals.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.040
Right?

08:25.243 --> 08:26.710
You there, Bush Tail!

08:27.512 --> 08:30.140
Bring me down that fruit
and make it snappy!

08:33.885 --> 08:36.428
Oh let's face it, without the power

08:36.453 --> 08:38.642
of Snake Mountain behind me...

08:39.057 --> 08:40.649
I'm nothing.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.766
What's that?

08:52.704 --> 08:54.350
I still think He-Man would've been

08:54.375 --> 08:55.807
a better choice for this trip.

08:55.807 --> 08:57.775
But father, I'm going to be king one day.

08:57.775 --> 09:00.073
I'll have to learn how to run the kingdom.

09:00.345 --> 09:01.487
Just remember, Adam.

09:01.512 --> 09:03.338
We're on an important journey.

09:03.548 --> 09:04.881
We'll have no time for

09:04.906 --> 09:06.541
your antics on this trip.

09:06.851 --> 09:09.376
I know, father.
You can count on me.

09:13.958 --> 09:15.192
It's the king,

09:15.217 --> 09:17.509
and with no guards here.

09:17.929 --> 09:19.796
Why, if I could capture him,

09:19.821 --> 09:22.583
Skeletor would gladly take me back.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.768
C'mon, you beasts!

09:25.103 --> 09:27.765
We have work to do.

09:33.912 --> 09:36.312
What's the first stop, Duncan?

09:36.614 --> 09:39.606
The city of Drisdos,
lies on the other side of this forest.

09:39.817 --> 09:42.047
We should be there in a few hours.

09:44.055 --> 09:45.613
What's that?

09:51.262 --> 09:52.490
Shadow Beasts!

09:57.535 --> 09:59.158
They shorted out our generator.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.120
We're defenseless and losing power.

10:18.690 --> 10:20.590
Stay down, father.
I'll handle this.

10:22.827 --> 10:24.590
Adam, wait! Come back!

10:26.731 --> 10:28.631
This freeze ray will slow them down.

10:30.668 --> 10:33.068
Well, lookie here.

10:34.272 --> 10:36.706
It's the cowardly Prince Adam.

10:40.878 --> 10:43.745
Let us go, Beast Man,
or you'll pay for this.

10:44.015 --> 10:45.561
Sorry, Prince.

10:45.586 --> 10:47.475
It's you who's going to pay...

10:48.152 --> 10:49.653
if you ever want to see

10:49.678 --> 10:51.373
your father a free man.

10:54.626 --> 10:56.743
Bring all the gold from the palace

10:56.768 --> 10:59.053
to Snake Mountain tonight.

10:59.597 --> 11:01.394
Do as I say...

11:01.633 --> 11:03.666
or the king will never

11:03.691 --> 11:06.185
leave Skeletor's Dungeon.

11:07.605 --> 11:09.436
Let me go!
-Father!

11:09.741 --> 11:13.074
And just so you don't try to follow us.

11:14.145 --> 11:17.945
We'll be long gone before that wears off.

11:33.298 --> 11:34.925
Right this way...

11:35.233 --> 11:36.757
Your Majesty.

11:39.137 --> 11:39.989
You furry devil.

11:40.014 --> 11:41.823
You'll never get away with this.

11:42.006 --> 11:43.735
Who's going to stop me?

11:43.975 --> 11:45.909
That weakling son, of yours?

11:46.911 --> 11:50.005
When he shows up tonight
I'll get him...

11:50.248 --> 11:52.478
and all your gold too.

11:54.218 --> 11:57.085
Monster, if you touch one
hair on that boy's head.

11:57.422 --> 11:59.617
Yeah.
Yeah, come on.

11:59.891 --> 12:02.917
You've got a date with Skeletor.

12:14.572 --> 12:17.507
Intruders!

12:21.045 --> 12:22.637
Hold it right there!

12:23.448 --> 12:25.712
Put that down, you fool.
It's me.

12:27.685 --> 12:29.687
What are you doing back here?

12:29.687 --> 12:32.952
I've brought Skeletor, a little gift.

12:33.758 --> 12:35.248
King Randor?!

12:36.828 --> 12:38.796
Well done, Beast Man.

12:39.230 --> 12:42.358
Skeletor is sure to take you back now.

12:43.401 --> 12:47.098
Where is the old skull face anyway?

12:47.805 --> 12:50.501
On a destruction mission out in space.

12:51.776 --> 12:53.641
He took the others with him.

12:53.911 --> 12:56.744
I got stuck with guard duty.

12:57.248 --> 12:58.825
Well, What do you say,

12:58.850 --> 13:00.618
we lock up our guest...

13:00.618 --> 13:03.143
and celebrate my return?

13:03.321 --> 13:04.845
Excellent!

13:10.395 --> 13:11.496
Are you alright?

13:11.496 --> 13:13.896
I'm fine, but the King...

13:14.198 --> 13:17.099
I know,
He's Beast Man's prisoner.

13:17.502 --> 13:20.037
Why didn't you turn to He-Man, lad?

13:20.037 --> 13:21.118
I wanted to show my

13:21.143 --> 13:23.189
father that I could be a hero too.

13:23.374 --> 13:25.035
but I failed.

13:25.376 --> 13:26.343
Look, son...

13:26.544 --> 13:28.474
You were given He-Man's power

13:28.499 --> 13:30.561
for a reason: to help others.

13:30.782 --> 13:32.297
No one ever said you could use

13:32.322 --> 13:34.139
that power to make yourself happy.

13:34.585 --> 13:35.820
I know that now,

13:35.845 --> 13:38.238
and I know what I have to do.

13:38.689 --> 13:41.089
By the power of Grayskull!

13:47.565 --> 13:51.501
I have the power!

14:03.681 --> 14:06.411
You stay here and get the
Attack Trak rolling again.

14:06.617 --> 14:08.258
I think this is one mission,

14:08.283 --> 14:10.099
He-Man should tackle himself.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.950
To Beast Man!

14:14.975 --> 14:19.052
The craftiest of Skeletor's warriors.

14:19.430 --> 14:21.660
Next to myself, that is.

14:22.266 --> 14:25.403
Actually,
I'm surprised you came...

14:25.403 --> 14:28.804
back, considering the
way you were treated...

14:31.843 --> 14:34.175
No, are you kidding?

14:34.445 --> 14:36.277
Old bone-head couldn't make

14:36.302 --> 14:38.269
a move without yours truly.

15:11.616 --> 15:12.951
Did you hear something?

15:13.351 --> 15:15.914
No, that's your imagination.

15:15.939 --> 15:17.402
Quit worrying.

15:34.805 --> 15:37.000
King Randor? Are you in there?

15:39.243 --> 15:40.801
I guess not.

15:41.012 --> 15:42.070
He-Man?

15:42.713 --> 15:44.180
Down here.

15:44.482 --> 15:46.916
He-Man, praise the Sorceress.

15:46.918 --> 15:48.230
Shh... quiet, Your Highness,

15:48.235 --> 15:49.820
with any luck I'll have you out of here

15:49.820 --> 15:50.787
and back to safety before

15:50.812 --> 15:51.971
the others know you're gone.

15:56.327 --> 15:57.453
Then again...

15:59.463 --> 16:02.660
The prisoner alarm!
The king...

16:02.665 --> 16:03.665
is escaping.

16:05.002 --> 16:07.197
[click] Skeletor's

16:07.838 --> 16:09.569
Hover Robots will bring him back.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.649
Surrender, intruders.
There is no escape.

16:19.850 --> 16:22.444
You better let me handle this, Sire.

16:22.687 --> 16:24.348
What? And miss a good scrap?!

16:24.589 --> 16:26.257
I never told Adam or Man-At-Arms...

16:26.257 --> 16:28.316
but I used to be quite a rowdy in my youth.

16:38.636 --> 16:41.434
Wouldn't Adam be surprised
if he could see me now?

16:41.639 --> 16:43.607
Yes, he would.

17:06.262 --> 17:09.493
I haven't fought like
that since I was a boy.

17:10.867 --> 17:14.269
Nice to know,
I still have the ol' left hook.

17:14.472 --> 17:16.440
Beast Man didn't hurt my son, did he?

17:16.440 --> 17:17.930
No, he's fine.

17:18.542 --> 17:20.413
I love that boy, you know?

17:20.438 --> 17:22.594
I'm hard on him sometimes...

17:22.680 --> 17:25.506
but I hope he knows how much I care.

17:26.083 --> 17:30.645
It's hard for a father to say,
'' I love you '', to his son.

17:31.055 --> 17:34.513
Sometimes,
it's hard for Adam to say that too.

17:34.725 --> 17:36.317
This way, Sire.

17:36.661 --> 17:39.289
You'll go nowhere, fool.

17:40.598 --> 17:43.863
You're not spoiling my victory, He-Man.

18:13.497 --> 18:14.828
He-Man!

18:17.601 --> 18:19.330
Naughty, naughty.

18:20.504 --> 18:23.337
It's not nice to sneak up on people.

18:31.449 --> 18:33.508
I guess we showed them.

18:34.952 --> 18:36.447
Let's go, Your Highness.

18:36.472 --> 18:38.776
Adam will be happy to see you.

18:46.097 --> 18:50.329
Well, Beastman, you've done it again.

18:50.668 --> 18:53.762
Skeletor won't be happy
when he hears about this.

18:54.405 --> 18:55.963
Skeletor?

18:57.141 --> 19:01.202
Do you think I care what
that bone-faced creep thinks?

19:01.612 --> 19:04.342
That arrogant loudmouth!

19:05.816 --> 19:08.498
If I ever see his ugly face again,

19:08.523 --> 19:11.403
it will be too soon.

19:12.456 --> 19:14.356
You furry flea-bitten fool.

19:14.592 --> 19:17.026
I'll cover my throne with your hide.

19:17.428 --> 19:19.453
Sk... Skeletor, I...

19:19.830 --> 19:23.095
I... I can explain everything...

19:23.300 --> 19:24.385
And so you will,

19:24.410 --> 19:26.782
once you clean up this mess.

19:26.971 --> 19:29.303
You too Mer-Man. Get busy.

19:30.007 --> 19:32.976
Well, I hope you're happy fool, now we're..

19:33.177 --> 19:34.872
both in trouble.

19:35.646 --> 19:37.665
Oh, I don't know,

19:37.690 --> 19:41.370
it's kind of nice to be home.

19:49.226 --> 19:51.786
I see the Attack Trak's
no worse for wear...

19:51.996 --> 19:54.590
after our little meeting
with the shadow beasts.

19:55.099 --> 19:56.826
And you're no worse for wear,

19:56.851 --> 19:58.650
after your encounter with Beast Man.

19:58.736 --> 19:59.799
Thanks to He-Man.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.920
You can learn a lot from him, Adam.

20:02.106 --> 20:04.404
I, think I already have.

20:05.142 --> 20:06.609
Now, what does that mean?

20:06.911 --> 20:10.247
Nothing, father...
do I look like the kind who'd

20:10.247 --> 20:13.216
argue with someone with a
good, left hook.

20:13.984 --> 20:15.611
No, I guess not.

20:17.121 --> 20:18.912
W-What?!

20:18.923 --> 20:22.484
I wonder... N-No.
It couldn't be.

20:27.064 --> 20:29.333
Today's story was about love,

20:29.333 --> 20:30.801
A very special kind.

20:30.801 --> 20:32.703
It was about the love a
parent has for a child.

20:32.703 --> 20:34.972
And I bet that's the
strongest love there is.

20:34.972 --> 20:37.441
Because, for one thing,
there's just about nothing that can

20:37.441 --> 20:39.033
change it, no matter what.

20:39.343 --> 20:40.778
Maybe, like Adam's father,

20:40.778 --> 20:43.747
your parents find it a little
difficult to say "I love you".

20:43.914 --> 20:46.517
Even so, you can be sure they do.

20:46.517 --> 20:48.819
Besides, let me ask you something:

20:48.819 --> 20:51.155
when was the last time you said

20:51.155 --> 20:52.645
"I love you" to them?

20:52.890 --> 20:53.982
Bye!
