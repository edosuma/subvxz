WEBVTT

00:02.735 --> 00:04.399
FELIX (into phone):
We'll be right down.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.934
Car's here.

00:05.935 --> 00:08.167
Your London internship awaits.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.739
Felix, I can't do this.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.374
Of course you can.

00:12.375 --> 00:15.210
Just remember, women are
birds, men are blokes,

00:15.211 --> 00:18.579
and a shag is more than
just a kind of carpet.

00:19.681 --> 00:21.215
Don't shag any blokes.

00:22.684 --> 00:27.225
No, I mean I can't be away
from you for three whole months.

00:27.226 --> 00:27.930
How about this?

00:27.931 --> 00:30.128
We can have breakfast
together every single day

00:30.129 --> 00:32.397
via the miracle of video conferencing.

00:32.398 --> 00:33.632
You can't do that.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.233
That'll be, like, 3:00 a.m. for you.

00:35.234 --> 00:36.401
Nonsense!

00:36.402 --> 00:38.569
Or as they say across
the pond, codswallop.

00:40.238 --> 00:42.040
You're so calm about this.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.376
Just a week ago,
you were begging me to stay.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.978
Well, I thought about it,

00:45.979 --> 00:48.113
and I trust you and I
trust our relationship.

00:48.114 --> 00:49.948
And even though we'll be
an ocean apart,

00:49.949 --> 00:52.149
I couldn't feel more secure.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.322
Where is she?!

00:57.323 --> 00:59.257
Why hasn't she called me?

00:59.258 --> 01:00.325
Maybe she met someone!

01:00.326 --> 01:01.093
Yes, that's it.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.028
I knew this would happen!

01:03.029 --> 01:05.096
(video call ringtone)

01:05.098 --> 01:07.199
Oh, hey, sweetie.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.434
There you are.

01:09.435 --> 01:10.502
<i>Hi, sorry I'm late.</i>

01:10.503 --> 01:13.005
I was out until 2:00 in the morning.

01:13.006 --> 01:15.240
Fergus took all of the
interns to the coolest pub.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.508
<i>(laughs)</i>

01:16.509 --> 01:18.243
That Fergus, what a guy.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.544
Handsome, charming,

01:19.545 --> 01:22.379
always blurring the line
between boss and employee.

01:25.751 --> 01:27.419
Fergus has taught me so much.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.921
This experience has been amazing.

01:29.922 --> 01:32.424
<i>I can't believe that
it's over in three days.</i>

01:32.425 --> 01:33.859
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

01:33.860 --> 01:36.094
<i>Just three more days until
the ceremonial shaving</i>

01:36.095 --> 01:38.597
<i>of my beard of devotion.</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:40.899
There's a ceremony?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.768
So, what's on tap for today?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.469
Oh, I forgot to tell you!

01:44.470 --> 01:46.405
This morning, I got a text from Fergus.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.905
Yay! More him!

01:50.509 --> 01:53.045
And he is so happy with
what I've been doing

01:53.046 --> 01:54.746
<i>that he asked me to
spend the weekend...</i>

01:54.747 --> 01:56.981
<i>(voice breaking up)</i>

01:58.116 --> 01:59.418
Spend the weekend doing what?

01:59.419 --> 02:00.819
Emily, you froze up.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.287
Doing what?

02:02.288 --> 02:03.721
Hello? Hello?!

02:05.157 --> 02:07.259
Hello?

02:07.260 --> 02:08.493
Damn it!

02:08.494 --> 02:09.894
Which way is England?

02:11.963 --> 02:13.564
Emily, hello?

02:14.633 --> 02:17.069
What is going on?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.336
Oh, just a nightmare.

02:20.439 --> 02:24.242
That moved in with me
and refuses to leave.

02:24.243 --> 02:25.911
I'm looking for a hotspot!

02:25.912 --> 02:27.344
You're about an hour late.

02:29.815 --> 02:31.616
Put your hand down.

02:31.617 --> 02:34.086
EMILY: <i>Felix? Hello?</i>

02:34.087 --> 02:36.588
Oh, good, you're back.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.757
Hi...

02:38.758 --> 02:40.525
guys.

02:40.526 --> 02:42.828
That's a pretty scarf.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.329
Thanks.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.965
There's a woman in Camden
Market who makes them by hand.

02:46.966 --> 02:50.836
Yeah, because now is definitely
the time for scarf talk.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.660
<i>You were saying something
about you and Fergus</i>

02:52.661 --> 02:53.638
<i>and a weekend?</i>

02:53.639 --> 02:54.639
Oh, yes.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.374
He asked me to spend the weekend

02:56.375 --> 02:58.443
designing pieces for the fall line

02:58.444 --> 02:59.811
while he's out of town!

02:59.812 --> 03:01.045
Oh, thank God.

03:02.047 --> 03:03.482
That, um...

03:03.483 --> 03:05.383
that he is recognizing your talent

03:05.384 --> 03:08.820
which was bestowed on you
by our Lord, amen.

03:08.821 --> 03:11.289
All right, well, Felix,
I should go, but...

03:11.290 --> 03:12.657
I love you.

03:12.658 --> 03:13.725
I love you more.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.827
No way, mister... I love <i>you</i> more.

03:15.828 --> 03:17.809
That's impossible, because
I love you so much...

03:18.764 --> 03:22.234
Sorry, I didn't see that ever ending.

03:22.235 --> 03:23.502
I know.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.670
These last three months
have taken quite a toll.

03:25.671 --> 03:27.239
I just miss Emily so much,

03:27.240 --> 03:31.309
and I'm terrified of
someone coming between us.

03:31.310 --> 03:32.877
We know the feeling.

03:35.213 --> 03:37.648
Not the threesome I was hoping for.

03:39.484 --> 03:40.885
Me neither.

- Will you stop with the blender?

04:17.678 --> 04:18.690
Sorry.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.559
I'm making Emily's welcome home dinner.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.581
I thought Emily wasn't
coming home till tomorrow.

04:25.864 --> 04:28.300
A romantic dinner requires preparation.

04:28.301 --> 04:31.770
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to tenderize my goose.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.104
You won't have to do that
when Emily gets back.

04:36.741 --> 04:39.644
Why does everybody hate high-fives?

04:39.645 --> 04:41.078
(faint shouting)

04:43.882 --> 04:45.116
Dani, what are you doing?

04:45.117 --> 04:46.518
Storing my stuff here.

04:46.519 --> 04:47.719
Now that Emily's coming back,

04:47.720 --> 04:49.023
I have to clear out of her place

04:49.024 --> 04:50.388
and find myself an apartment.

04:50.389 --> 04:51.489
What about your apartment?

04:51.490 --> 04:52.657
I can't go back there,

04:52.658 --> 04:54.219
with the high rent and the bad plumbing

04:54.220 --> 04:55.803
and the creepy neighbor who spies on me

04:55.804 --> 04:57.978
through the bullet hole in the wall.

05:00.177 --> 05:02.334
Well, I'm sure you'll
find someplace great.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.002
Not as good as Emily's,

05:04.003 --> 05:05.971
with the free cable
and the clear water,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.605
and is no one concerned
about the bullet hole?

05:11.943 --> 05:14.244
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have to glaze my strudel.

05:15.991 --> 05:18.482
He won't have to do that
when Emily gets back.

05:21.586 --> 05:23.754
I believe you're on the clock.

05:26.244 --> 05:27.325
- Hi, Dani.
- Hi, Charlotte.

05:27.326 --> 05:28.326
I'm off to work.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.167
I'll see you tonight?

05:29.168 --> 05:30.191
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

05:30.192 --> 05:30.929
Ooh, big plans?

05:30.930 --> 05:32.497
Yes, a little birdie reminded me

05:32.498 --> 05:34.232
that it's our three-month anniversary.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.034
So that birdie's
boyfriend is taking her

05:36.035 --> 05:37.636
to a romantic dinner.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.304
Yes, they're going to be
the cutest couple at Langford's.

05:41.706 --> 05:42.940
Langford's?

05:44.342 --> 05:46.344
The sports bar where
we go all the time?

05:46.345 --> 05:47.679
Where you're so comfortable,

05:47.680 --> 05:50.882
you've literally worn pajama bottoms?

05:50.883 --> 05:53.218
You're saying good things,

05:53.219 --> 05:56.487
but in a tone that makes me feel shame.

05:57.622 --> 06:00.725
I just assumed we were
going someplace special,

06:00.726 --> 06:03.361
given the occasion,
but Langford's is fine.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.896
That's right, I mean, let's face it,

06:04.897 --> 06:06.798
we've only been going
out for three months,

06:06.799 --> 06:09.393
and at our age, three months
goes by in, like, a day.

06:11.202 --> 06:12.037
"Our age"?

06:12.038 --> 06:13.571
My age.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.240
Not our age.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.641
I was just thinking that for me,

06:16.642 --> 06:19.843
time goes by really fast,
except for now.

06:21.579 --> 06:23.480
Which feels like forever.

06:24.516 --> 06:27.918
This is how walls get bullet holes.

06:29.054 --> 06:30.588
I will see you tonight.

06:30.589 --> 06:33.491
Why don't you wear your fancy pajamas?

06:33.492 --> 06:34.992
Ooh, the one with the feet!

06:37.228 --> 06:44.102
(video call ringtone)

06:44.103 --> 06:47.339
Emily, what a surprise.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.040
I should warn you,
if this is a booty call,

06:49.041 --> 06:50.742
we are not alone.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.077
Ugh.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.346
<i>I'm calling because
I have some great news.</i>

06:54.347 --> 06:55.547
Well, at least I think it's great,

06:55.548 --> 06:56.715
and I hope that you do too.

06:56.716 --> 06:58.049
<i>I'm sure I will... what is it?</i>

06:58.050 --> 06:59.184
Well, Fergus just called.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.251
Of course he did!

07:00.252 --> 07:02.153
He calls you all the time!

07:02.154 --> 07:04.422
And he's so happy with
what I've been doing

07:04.423 --> 07:06.057
that he asked me to help him

07:06.058 --> 07:07.759
at the big jewelry show in Paris.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.994
<i>And that's tonight?</i>

07:08.995 --> 07:13.631
No, it's in three weeks, so...

07:13.632 --> 07:15.432
I'd be home in a month.

07:18.303 --> 07:20.572
Damn it, the screen froze.

07:20.573 --> 07:21.972
Felix?

07:23.174 --> 07:24.274
<i>Screen didn't freeze.</i>

07:26.044 --> 07:27.579
<i>He's just in shock.</i>

07:27.580 --> 07:29.280
<i>Right, Felix?</i>

07:29.281 --> 07:31.483
Oh, wow.

07:31.484 --> 07:32.917
Wow, another month.

07:32.918 --> 07:33.918
Whoo!

07:33.919 --> 07:35.152
Exciting news, though.

07:35.728 --> 07:37.790
Hey listen, don't you worry
about your apartment.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.352
I will get your mail,
water your plants,

07:39.353 --> 07:40.736
and upgrade your cable to premium.

07:40.737 --> 07:42.867
<i>The Walking Dead</i> is coming back!

07:52.307 --> 07:53.777
You know, I was kind of disappointed

07:53.778 --> 07:55.045
in that tapas restaurant.

07:55.046 --> 07:58.548
Is that because you
thought I said "topless"?

07:58.549 --> 07:59.883
No!

07:59.884 --> 08:01.383
Yes.

08:03.653 --> 08:05.622
Actually, let's go to your place.

08:05.623 --> 08:07.391
Why aren't we going in?

08:07.392 --> 08:08.225
It's Felix.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.493
He's moping over Emily.

08:09.494 --> 08:11.395
I can ignore him,
but you'll get sucked in.

08:11.396 --> 08:12.796
You've got a girl heart.

08:12.797 --> 08:13.897
Emily?

08:13.898 --> 08:14.965
Oh, sorry.

08:14.966 --> 08:16.400
I heard a woman's voice

08:16.401 --> 08:18.934
and thought I might
have a reason to live.

08:21.071 --> 08:22.072
Phew!

08:22.073 --> 08:22.973
That was a close one.

08:22.974 --> 08:23.906
Let's go.

08:26.009 --> 08:28.144
Girl heart.

08:29.513 --> 08:30.781
Felix,

08:30.782 --> 08:31.882
what are you doing?

08:31.883 --> 08:33.250
Just because Emily can't be here

08:33.251 --> 08:35.315
is no reason to let this
delicious meal go to waste.

08:35.316 --> 08:36.285
I thought I could use it

08:36.287 --> 08:38.570
to plug the empty hole
where my heart used to be.

08:41.323 --> 08:42.558
Plug away, pal!

08:42.559 --> 08:43.626
Charlotte, let's go!

08:43.628 --> 08:45.462
Oscar!

08:45.463 --> 08:47.064
We can't leave him alone like this.

08:47.065 --> 08:48.131
He's in pain.

08:48.132 --> 08:49.800
I wish I were in pain.

08:49.801 --> 08:51.834
That would mean I could still feel.

08:53.270 --> 08:54.137
Here we go.

08:54.138 --> 08:55.539
Oscar!

08:55.540 --> 08:56.807
We're staying.

08:56.808 --> 08:57.841
Wonderful.

08:57.842 --> 08:59.209
Help yourselves to goose.

08:59.210 --> 09:00.677
I will grab some extra plates.

09:00.678 --> 09:03.712
And yes, Oscar, your Batman fork.

09:05.549 --> 09:07.017
How can you be so callous?

09:07.018 --> 09:08.418
I'm just sick of it.

09:08.419 --> 09:10.620
He's been wallowing over
Emily for three months now.

09:10.621 --> 09:11.688
He's a wallower,

09:11.689 --> 09:15.058
and I will no longer
swallow that wallow.

09:15.059 --> 09:16.426
He's a romantic.

09:16.427 --> 09:18.962
Not that I'd expect you to understand.

09:18.963 --> 09:21.298
What's that supposed to mean?

09:21.299 --> 09:22.962
I was afraid you were
going to abandon me,

09:22.963 --> 09:24.734
like so many others.

09:24.735 --> 09:25.836
Thank you for being here.

09:25.837 --> 09:28.871
Well, the vote was a tie.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.141
CHARLOTTE: Felix,

09:31.142 --> 09:33.210
have you told Emily how upset you are?

09:33.211 --> 09:35.786
Oh yes, and show her that I'm
the neediest man in the world?

09:35.787 --> 09:36.580
Women love that.

09:36.581 --> 09:38.715
You need to tell her how you feel.

09:38.716 --> 09:41.184
It's just so hard to talk about
feelings over the computer.

09:41.185 --> 09:43.386
Have you thought
about flying to London?

09:43.387 --> 09:45.301
Talking to her in person?

09:45.302 --> 09:46.469
What? That's insane.

09:46.470 --> 09:47.603
Who does that?

09:47.604 --> 09:48.805
Oh, I don't know,

09:48.806 --> 09:51.073
someone with romance in his soul?

09:51.074 --> 09:54.010
Who's never heard of a telephone.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.511
That's a great idea.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.480
I could fly out tomorrow morning,

09:57.481 --> 10:00.183
surprise her, take her in my arms,

10:00.184 --> 10:02.050
and kiss her enthusiastically
on the mouth.

10:03.085 --> 10:04.821
I can do this.

10:04.822 --> 10:06.255
I mean, I'm terrified of flying,

10:06.256 --> 10:08.958
but I'm more terrified of
another month without Emily.

10:08.959 --> 10:09.959
I'm going!

10:09.960 --> 10:11.543
Should I pack the goose or carry it on?

10:11.544 --> 10:13.449
You know what,
they have geese in England!

10:14.664 --> 10:17.266
I'll have you know I can
be pretty damn romantic.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.668
Remember last night,

10:18.669 --> 10:20.412
when we shared that
milkshake at Langford's?

10:20.413 --> 10:22.004
It was your third one.

10:22.005 --> 10:24.073
You couldn't finish it,
so you pushed it over to me

10:24.074 --> 10:27.009
and said you had to
unbutton your pants.

10:27.010 --> 10:30.378
And that is why I wear pajama bottoms.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.720
Thanks for helping me plan my date.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.122
I really want Charlotte to
know that I'm a romantic guy.

10:40.123 --> 10:41.190
You got it.

10:41.191 --> 10:42.625
I'm your agent...

10:42.626 --> 10:45.027
...of love.

10:45.028 --> 10:47.563
Here's what I got so far:
put on a suit...

10:47.564 --> 10:48.498
One that fits.

10:48.499 --> 10:49.464
Good, that's good.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.568
Then a carriage ride through the park,

10:52.569 --> 10:53.836
followed by dinner...

10:53.837 --> 10:56.506
At a place that doesn't
serve curly fries.

10:56.507 --> 10:58.607
Damn it, Teddy, you're on fire!

11:00.576 --> 11:02.612
Yeah!

11:02.613 --> 11:05.915
Then we come back here,
I put on a little mood music...

11:05.916 --> 11:07.483
she loves her Boyz II Men.

11:07.484 --> 11:09.252
That's one classy lady.

11:09.253 --> 11:12.087
Then I'll light some candles
and wow her with...

11:13.222 --> 11:14.490
Oh, Oscar, I'm flattered,

11:14.491 --> 11:18.160
but I think my wife might
have a problem with that.

11:18.161 --> 11:19.078
No, not that!

11:19.079 --> 11:21.199
I need you to help me come
up with some grand gesture.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.584
Something that will show Charlotte

11:22.585 --> 11:23.933
that I have romance in my soul.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.769
If only I had a way of
knowing what women think,

11:26.770 --> 11:28.404
what goes on in their brains.

11:28.405 --> 11:29.388
Well, you know, Oscar...

11:29.389 --> 11:31.641
Not now, Dani!

11:31.642 --> 11:34.075
Now I don't feel so bad
about taking your toaster.

11:36.012 --> 11:37.747
Why does this have to be so hard?

11:37.748 --> 11:39.592
Charlotte and I have been
going out for three months.

11:39.593 --> 11:40.679
I thought we were way past

11:40.680 --> 11:42.685
this whole having-to-prove-
yourself thing.

11:42.686 --> 11:44.687
(laughing)

11:44.688 --> 11:48.190
Oh, you poor, magnificent man-child.

11:48.191 --> 11:49.574
I've been married almost 20 years,

11:49.575 --> 11:50.626
and let me tell you,

11:50.627 --> 11:52.428
you always have to
keep proving yourself.

11:52.429 --> 11:53.529
- Seriously?
- Yes.

11:53.530 --> 11:56.098
Women need to feel
loved and appreciated.

11:56.099 --> 12:00.169
"Romance" is just a fancy word
for showing you give a crap.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.938
Damn.

12:01.939 --> 12:04.039
You should give a seminar.

12:06.042 --> 12:08.711
I'll make some calls
and see if I can come up

12:08.712 --> 12:10.546
with a romantic surprise for tonight.

12:10.547 --> 12:12.114
Thanks, Teddy.

12:12.115 --> 12:16.017
"Give... a... crap."

12:18.521 --> 12:21.023
Well, I'm off to the airport.

12:21.024 --> 12:22.992
Quick question:

12:22.993 --> 12:24.726
do you know where my arm is?

12:26.729 --> 12:29.164
Maybe you packed it in your suitcase?

12:31.200 --> 12:32.500
Aha!

12:33.769 --> 12:35.071
What's going on?

12:35.072 --> 12:38.140
Hm? Oh, maybe it was
those pills that you gave me.

12:38.141 --> 12:39.542
The sleeping pills?

12:39.543 --> 12:41.210
I told you to take those at the airport

12:41.211 --> 12:42.878
so you wouldn't freak out on the plane!

12:42.879 --> 12:44.080
I took them early

12:44.081 --> 12:46.748
so that I would not
freak out in the Uber.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.385
I'll be all right.

12:49.386 --> 12:51.986
Oh, look, this monkey wants
me to take a nap with him.

12:54.323 --> 12:55.958
Felix, come on!

12:55.959 --> 12:57.627
You're going to miss your plane.

12:57.628 --> 12:59.128
No, no, can't do that.

12:59.129 --> 13:02.263
Must show Emily that she's
worth crossing an ocean for.

13:07.136 --> 13:09.238
I'm not going to make it!

13:09.239 --> 13:12.141
Tell Emily I love her
more than life itself!

13:12.142 --> 13:14.210
I'm not going to England.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.610
I was talking to the monkey.

13:17.580 --> 13:20.516
Felix, I hate seeing
you torn up like this.

13:20.517 --> 13:21.683
(knock at door)

13:26.522 --> 13:28.724
Somebody call a car for the airport?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.059
Felix, come on!

13:30.060 --> 13:32.627
You gotta get up and
tell Emily how you feel!

13:34.830 --> 13:37.065
So nobody's going to the airport?

13:39.235 --> 13:40.770
You know what?

13:40.771 --> 13:43.239
I guess I am.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.841
Just get some ticket money...

13:45.842 --> 13:48.409
Ooh, I'm gonna be flying first class!

13:57.135 --> 14:00.003
(rapid knocking)

14:00.351 --> 14:02.319
Who is it?

14:02.320 --> 14:04.821
I should warn you, I'm American,

14:04.822 --> 14:08.825
so I'm aggressive and overconfident!

14:08.826 --> 14:10.561
OSCAR: It's me... Oscar.

14:10.562 --> 14:12.195
Oscar?

14:12.196 --> 14:14.798
What are you doing here?

14:14.799 --> 14:16.600
It's 3:00 a.m.

14:16.601 --> 14:19.102
And... England.

14:19.103 --> 14:20.537
Felix can't live without you.

14:20.538 --> 14:22.072
You gotta come back to New York.

14:22.073 --> 14:23.273
And can I use your loo?

14:23.274 --> 14:24.241
What?

14:24.242 --> 14:26.510
Loo. It's British for
"bathroom," right?

14:26.511 --> 14:27.478
I don't understand.

14:27.479 --> 14:29.146
It was a really long flight,

14:29.147 --> 14:32.649
and there was always
somebody in the bathroom,

14:32.650 --> 14:33.984
and those signs at the airport

14:33.985 --> 14:35.399
can be really confusing.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.933
Not that.

14:36.934 --> 14:41.037
If Felix is missing me so
much, why did he send you?

14:41.038 --> 14:44.540
Why didn't he just come himself,
or I don't know, call me?

14:44.541 --> 14:47.009
Are there dishes in
your sink right now?

14:47.911 --> 14:49.482
Bathroom's right there.

14:49.483 --> 14:50.883
Okay, thank you.

14:56.656 --> 15:02.027
(video call ringtone)

15:08.134 --> 15:10.704
Surprise!

15:10.705 --> 15:14.340
I am... not in London.

15:14.341 --> 15:15.775
What time is it?

15:15.776 --> 15:17.310
It's 3:00 in the morning.

15:17.311 --> 15:18.278
What?

15:18.279 --> 15:19.145
What's happening?

15:19.146 --> 15:20.547
<i>We need to talk.</i>

15:20.548 --> 15:22.315
<i>(toilet flushing)</i>

15:22.316 --> 15:23.650
Was that a toilet flush?

15:23.651 --> 15:25.452
Is someone there with you?

15:25.453 --> 15:27.187
<i>Yeah, that's what we
need to talk about!</i>

15:27.188 --> 15:28.455
<i>I knew it!</i>

15:28.456 --> 15:30.056
<i>It's Fergus, isn't it?!</i>

15:30.057 --> 15:34.394
You're leaving me for that
scone-munching tea-slurper!

15:34.395 --> 15:36.896
Felix, what are you talking about?

15:36.897 --> 15:38.998
I never should have trusted you.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.233
<i>Okay.</i>

15:40.234 --> 15:43.837
First of all, Fergus is gay.

15:43.838 --> 15:47.273
Exactly... he's just your type.

15:47.274 --> 15:49.442
And you couldn't trust me?

15:49.443 --> 15:52.345
Is that why you sent your
lackey to spy on me?

15:52.346 --> 15:53.179
What?

15:53.180 --> 15:54.380
Oh, man!

15:54.381 --> 15:56.394
I didn't think that was ever gonna end.

15:57.413 --> 15:58.714
Oscar, what are you doing there?

15:58.715 --> 16:00.448
When I saw you couldn't go to England,

16:00.449 --> 16:01.749
I felt bad for you.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.217
So I figured I'd go for you

16:03.218 --> 16:05.052
and tell Emily how you feel.

16:05.053 --> 16:07.288
Oh, he just told me how he feels.

16:07.289 --> 16:08.890
He thinks I'm a slut.

16:08.891 --> 16:09.991
I never said that.

16:09.992 --> 16:12.525
Felix, have you seen Oscar?

16:15.496 --> 16:17.565
<i>Honey, look where I am!</i>

16:17.566 --> 16:19.967
Are you in London?

16:19.968 --> 16:21.235
What are you doing?

16:21.236 --> 16:23.371
Felix sent him to spy on me.

16:23.372 --> 16:25.439
Oscar, we're supposed
to be having dinner.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.707
Didn't you get my text?

16:26.708 --> 16:28.543
Uh, yeah, I did.

16:28.544 --> 16:32.712
"Airplane, British flag,
watermelon, cactus."

16:34.415 --> 16:37.051
I've got big thumbs!

16:37.052 --> 16:39.120
So you just flew to London?

16:39.121 --> 16:40.417
All right, it's a long story.

16:40.418 --> 16:41.719
<i>See, when Felix...</i>

16:41.720 --> 16:43.654
<i>(voice breaking up)</i>

16:43.655 --> 16:44.955
Frozen.

16:44.956 --> 16:46.556
To Oscar's bedroom!

16:50.861 --> 16:53.497
<i>And that about explains everything.</i>

16:53.498 --> 16:55.299
Oscar, can you do that again?

16:55.300 --> 16:58.334
That's not the first time
you've said that in that bed.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.238
Felix missed Emily,

17:01.239 --> 17:03.240
and he wanted to tell her in person.

17:03.241 --> 17:06.443
But he couldn't make his flight,
so I came for him.

17:06.444 --> 17:07.778
Seriously?

17:07.779 --> 17:09.413
I'm sorry I missed our dinner.

17:09.414 --> 17:11.181
I can't believe you did that.

17:11.182 --> 17:15.385
That is... incredibly romantic.

17:15.386 --> 17:17.553
Right!

17:19.021 --> 17:21.191
Because...?

17:21.192 --> 17:25.162
Flying halfway around the
world in the name of love?

17:25.163 --> 17:27.030
It's beautiful!

17:27.031 --> 17:28.365
Well, what can I say?

17:28.366 --> 17:29.899
I love love.

17:32.402 --> 17:33.504
EMILY: <i>Well!</i>

17:33.505 --> 17:34.638
Now that that's settled,

17:34.639 --> 17:36.707
maybe I can get back to whoring around.

17:36.708 --> 17:37.841
Right, Felix?

17:37.842 --> 17:38.825
That's not what I meant.

17:38.826 --> 17:41.111
Then why don't you just
tell me what you did mean?

17:41.112 --> 17:42.146
Okay, Emily.

17:42.147 --> 17:43.700
From the bottom of my heart...

17:43.701 --> 17:44.968
TEDDY: <i>Oscar? Charlotte?</i>

17:44.969 --> 17:46.102
BOTH: In here.

17:47.938 --> 17:49.306
Hello!

17:49.307 --> 17:50.606
We're Boyz II Men.

17:54.711 --> 17:55.979
Ta-da!

17:55.980 --> 17:57.314
You must be Charlotte.

17:57.315 --> 17:59.442
Oscar thinks you're a
very special lady.

17:59.443 --> 18:00.308
And that's why

18:00.309 --> 18:01.131
he wants you to...

18:01.132 --> 18:03.133
â™ª Close your eyes â™ª

18:03.134 --> 18:05.603
â™ª Make a wish â™ª

18:05.604 --> 18:09.974
â™ª And blow out the candlelight â™ª

18:09.975 --> 18:14.778
â™ª I'll make love to you, â™ª
â™ª like you want me to â™ª

18:14.779 --> 18:18.248
â™ª And I'll hold you tight, â™ª
â™ª baby, all through the night â™ª

18:18.249 --> 18:19.483
Wait, wait, wait!

18:19.484 --> 18:22.286
(singing stops)

18:22.287 --> 18:23.886
Where's Oscar?

18:25.155 --> 18:26.423
<i>Hey, Teddy!</i>

18:26.424 --> 18:27.658
<i>Guess where I am?</i>

18:27.659 --> 18:28.792
<i>I'm sorry I didn't tell you.</i>

18:28.793 --> 18:29.727
<i>I'm in London!</i>

18:29.728 --> 18:30.437
Damn it, Oscar!

18:30.438 --> 18:32.079
Do you know how many
strings I had to pull

18:32.080 --> 18:33.181
to get Boyz II Men here?

18:33.182 --> 18:34.632
I sat in the fourth row

18:34.633 --> 18:36.667
at your Madison Square Garden concert.

18:36.668 --> 18:37.668
I remember.

18:37.669 --> 18:39.102
Oh, you do not!

18:41.472 --> 18:43.440
How could I forget
such a beautiful face?

18:43.441 --> 18:44.508
Oh!

18:44.509 --> 18:45.943
Back off, Boyz II Men!

18:45.944 --> 18:48.178
Everyone shut up!

18:48.179 --> 18:50.681
Not you guys, obviously,
you guys sound really great.

18:50.682 --> 18:52.716
Maybe you could give me
some back-up, in fact?

18:52.717 --> 18:55.552
â™ª I'll make love to you... â™ª

18:55.553 --> 18:57.321
I'm sorry that I didn't trust you.

18:57.322 --> 18:58.460
I guess I was just afraid.

18:58.461 --> 19:00.361
But when you said you weren't
coming back for another month,

19:00.362 --> 19:02.790
part of me was worried that
you weren't coming back at all.

19:02.791 --> 19:04.057
That's crazy!

19:04.058 --> 19:05.726
Of course I'm coming back.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.160
I love you.

19:07.161 --> 19:08.529
I love you too, Emily.

19:08.530 --> 19:10.564
If you're worried,
I'll come back right now.

19:10.565 --> 19:11.732
No, no, no.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.156
Now that I see how silly I've been,

19:13.157 --> 19:14.401
I want you to stay.

19:14.402 --> 19:16.065
I'll be waiting for you
when you get back.

19:16.066 --> 19:17.237
Um, you know,

19:17.238 --> 19:18.906
we have a show here

19:18.907 --> 19:21.174
if you want to come check us out.

19:21.175 --> 19:24.043
OSCAR: <i>Hey, Boyz II Men, get
your mitts off my girl!</i>

19:25.078 --> 19:26.313
I'm sorry.

19:26.314 --> 19:30.717
I'm taken by my very
romantic boyfriend.

19:30.718 --> 19:32.152
Fair enough... our job is done.

19:32.153 --> 19:33.453
Uh, hey!

19:33.454 --> 19:35.055
Oscar's paying you for a full hour,

19:35.056 --> 19:36.990
so you mind swinging by my place?

19:36.991 --> 19:38.725
You know any Fifth Dimension?

19:38.726 --> 19:40.894
Oscar Madison,

19:40.895 --> 19:43.063
you get back here as soon as you can.

19:43.064 --> 19:44.731
I'll be on the next plane.

19:44.732 --> 19:48.569
And Felix, I'll be thinking
about you every minute.

19:48.570 --> 19:50.403
I love you, Emily.

19:52.406 --> 19:53.240
All right.

19:53.241 --> 19:54.240
Oh!

20:03.328 --> 20:06.092
Only a few more boxes... and I am back

20:06.093 --> 20:07.694
in Emily's apartment.

20:07.695 --> 20:10.599
I don't know why I'm holding
on to these Beanie Babies.

20:15.769 --> 20:18.705
Oscar says he's in the lobster.

20:18.706 --> 20:21.441
I think he means "lobby."

20:21.442 --> 20:24.176
You know, I'm starting to
think it's not his thumbs.

20:25.578 --> 20:27.547
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

20:27.548 --> 20:29.815
I'm back from England!

20:30.950 --> 20:33.185
Can't help it... I love him.

20:35.088 --> 20:36.189
Got something for you.

20:36.190 --> 20:37.290
Oh no, Oscar,

20:37.291 --> 20:38.755
you've already done too much for me.

20:38.756 --> 20:39.755
You sure?

20:42.984 --> 20:44.651
He says he doesn't want you.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.686
Emily!

20:49.223 --> 20:51.285
What about your jewelry show?

20:51.560 --> 20:53.394
Paris is the most
romantic city in the world.

20:53.395 --> 20:55.396
I didn't want to be there without you.

20:55.397 --> 20:57.430
Thank you, Oscar.

20:58.599 --> 20:59.667
Oh!

20:59.668 --> 21:01.035
Hey, Dani, I'm back!

21:01.036 --> 21:03.236
Son of a bitch!
