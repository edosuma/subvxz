01:00.228 --> 01:02.966
<i>An energy being

Which one of you motherfuckers
wants me to jerk a knot
in your ass?

01:14.027 --> 01:14.936
[Cliff] Fuck me.

[Mr. Nobody] <i>One day,
these clowns jumped

broke out.</i>

[Ezekiel]
Now comes their reckoning.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.830
They lashed their whips
at you, dear Lord,

03:15.866 --> 03:20.336
and now they will be lashed
with eternal flame.

03:20.370 --> 03:22.872
I have been faithful

04:07.084 --> 04:10.818
Grant Morrison fans,
Reddit trolls with
DC subscriptions,

04:10.854 --> 04:14.955
and the three new fans
who stuck around
after the donkey fart.

04:14.991 --> 04:17.826
You still think you control
this story, don't you?

04:17.860 --> 04:22.031
Haven't seen any evidence
to the contrary, old friend.

04:22.064 --> 04:27.064
To wit. You've slipped through
my fingers for the last time.

04:30.805 --> 04:32.454
[Larry] No!

04:35.975 --> 04:38.225
It's the Chief!

04:42.016 --> 04:46.221
[screaming and grunting]

04:46.254 --> 04:47.855
[screaming]

04:47.889 --> 04:48.889
No!

04:57.264 --> 05:00.970
[Cliff] Jane! Jane!

05:01.002 --> 05:02.237
Don't do it.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.838
Wait! No, don't do it!

05:04.872 --> 05:06.673
No. Jane, what are you doing?

05:06.673 --> 05:09.644
No! No. Jane!

05:09.677 --> 05:11.627
Jane! No! No!

05:27.728 --> 05:30.427
[Cliff] Holy shit.

05:38.004 --> 05:42.810
-[explosion]
-[Cliff gasps]

05:42.845 --> 05:46.281
Holy shit!

05:46.314 --> 05:49.483
-[gasps] Holy shit!
-We get the point!

05:49.519 --> 05:51.987
We all saw it, there's no need
to restate the obvious.

05:52.021 --> 05:54.557
[Cliff] I'm sorry.
Am I reacting too much
for you?

05:54.557 --> 05:56.725
[Rita] I just don't see how
hysterics are going to help.

05:56.725 --> 05:58.259
[Cliff] One,
I don't get hysterical.

05:58.293 --> 05:59.927
Two, what are you
doing to help?

05:59.961 --> 06:03.031
Me? Well, nothing.

06:03.064 --> 06:05.165
Look, it's all going
to be fine.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.502
Chief disappears all the time.

06:06.535 --> 06:08.504
[Cliff]
Into a fucking hole?

06:08.536 --> 06:10.305
In the fucking ground?

06:10.338 --> 06:12.673
[Rita] Well, don't get
snippy with me.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.242
I've known Niles Caulder
a long time,

06:14.276 --> 06:17.778
and no matter
how long he's gone,
he always comes back.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.281
[Cliff] What about Jane?

06:19.314 --> 06:20.482
What about the town?

06:20.514 --> 06:22.218
Jane can take care
of herself, believe me.

06:22.252 --> 06:25.153
And Chief will know
what to do about the town
when he gets back.

06:25.187 --> 06:27.189
[Cliff]
So, denial beats hysteria?

06:27.223 --> 06:31.560
You're ignoring the part
where Chief said his enemies
were coming for him.

06:31.593 --> 06:33.629
Actually,
you ignored that part

06:33.661 --> 06:36.764
when you insisted on
staying behind to, what?

06:36.798 --> 06:39.502
Protect some townies?
Punch some bad guys?

06:39.535 --> 06:41.170
We could've been
miles from here by now.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.673
[Cliff] But you're not.
You turned the bus
around for me.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.706
Jane turned the bus
around for you.

06:45.740 --> 06:48.711
I went along with it
in a moment of
temporary insanity.

06:48.711 --> 06:50.512
[Cliff] So, sue me for
wanting to do the right thing.

06:50.512 --> 06:53.781
And what does the right thing
look like now?

06:53.814 --> 06:57.418
Look around, Cliff.

06:57.451 --> 07:02.324
You can't punch nothing.

07:02.357 --> 07:06.725
[Cliff] Someone is
responsible for this.

07:06.761 --> 07:08.697
[Larry] We are.

07:08.730 --> 07:13.002
Everything that's happened
went exactly as it was
supposed to.

07:13.035 --> 07:16.939
This is what
the world looks like
when we try to live in it.

07:16.971 --> 07:18.906
Niles warned us.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.975
Then proved himself right.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.011
We'd be well-served
to take the Chief's advice
from now on.

07:26.548 --> 07:28.449
[Cliff] You're kidding me.

07:28.483 --> 07:29.685
You're gonna run again?

07:29.718 --> 07:32.487
[Larry] As far away
from here as possible.

07:32.521 --> 07:35.088
[Cliff]
Where are you going?

07:35.124 --> 07:36.959
It's Thursday.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.026
Trash day?

07:38.060 --> 07:39.528
[Cliff] So that's it?

07:39.562 --> 07:41.161
I'm going this alone.

07:41.196 --> 07:43.966
What did you expect, Cliff?

07:43.999 --> 07:47.370
We're not heroes.

08:23.271 --> 08:28.271

it wants to talk to you.

08:32.514 --> 08:34.913

09:56.365 --> 09:58.634
<i>I just downloaded your
systems report for analysis.</i>

09:58.667 --> 10:00.500
Nothing to debrief,
simple mugging.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.101
<i>Oh, thank God for Cyborg.</i>

10:02.134 --> 10:03.740
<i>You saved a whole $600.</i>

10:03.773 --> 10:05.307
And a possible murder victim.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.841
She saw the mugger's face.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.211
This was the second location,
there wasn't going
to be a third.

10:09.245 --> 10:13.148
<i>So you spent 57 seconds
messing with the perps
instead of disarming them.</i>

10:13.182 --> 10:16.618
-Can we just fast-forward
to your conclusion?
<i>-Okay.</i>

10:16.652 --> 10:19.220
<i>You're capable of better.</i>

10:19.254 --> 10:21.322

Do better. Copy that.

10:55.490 --> 10:58.158
<i>I know you sent us out here
to investigate an attack,</i>

10:58.192 --> 11:00.461
but, uh, there's nothing here.

rope it off?</i>

11:04.701 --> 11:08.638
[Jim] <i>Yeah. Call it
water contamination or
a gas leak or some shit.</i>

11:08.668 --> 11:10.840

[Frank] <i>Cloverton.
Cloverton, Ohio.</i>

11:28.724 --> 11:32.225
So, what have you got planned
for the rest of the day?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.562
After you fix my eye.

11:34.596 --> 11:36.562
There is no "after," Vic.

11:36.599 --> 11:40.735
Improving your programming
is a full-time job.

11:40.769 --> 11:44.870
-Finally.
-[door hisses]

11:44.904 --> 11:47.341
Niles!

11:47.375 --> 11:49.009
Vic. [laughs]

11:49.043 --> 11:52.148
Good God!
Have you grown another inch
since I last saw you?

11:52.182 --> 11:55.481
Impossible.
The cybernetics froze his
growth after the accident.

11:55.518 --> 11:57.585
And you haven't
changed a bit.

11:57.620 --> 11:58.918
How the hell are you, Silas?

11:58.955 --> 12:02.625
Impatient.
We said 10:30, Niles.

12:02.657 --> 12:04.591
[sighs]

12:04.625 --> 12:06.094
You know, the astronomers
at Atacama

12:06.129 --> 12:08.532
couldn't figure out why I was
so interested in their glass.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.067
And the Chinese,
they wouldn't even
let me into Yunnan.

12:11.099 --> 12:16.099
So I had to crib
my lensing technique from
an exiled Burmese engineer.

12:16.471 --> 12:18.041
So, just a regular day
at the office.

12:18.072 --> 12:20.875
Well, the exercise
keeps me young.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.610
And it was worth it.

12:22.644 --> 12:24.177
How's the circus in Cloverton?

12:24.211 --> 12:25.215
[Niles] It keeps me busy.

12:25.245 --> 12:29.518
I'm working with
some fascinating people.

Each one of them is just...

Uh, a great sky country.

13:35.484 --> 13:39.788
[Larry] Great. I've been
wanting to work on my tan.

[electricity crackling]

15:04.437 --> 15:05.639
[groans in frustration]

15:05.673 --> 15:07.143
You son of a bitch.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.312
-What do you want from me?
-[people yelp]

15:09.344 --> 15:13.148
I'm trying to protect
people... from you!

15:13.178 --> 15:14.716
From you!

15:14.750 --> 15:16.451
Just let me go.

15:16.484 --> 15:18.552
Let me go!

15:18.586 --> 15:19.937
[panting]

15:43.245 --> 15:47.981
[Cliff grunts]
Here, donkey, donkey, donkey.

15:48.017 --> 15:51.284
Here, boy. Come here.

15:51.321 --> 15:53.822
Hold still. No, donkey!
Hee-haw!

15:53.855 --> 15:55.724
Fuck! Hey, wait up.

15:55.758 --> 15:59.058
[donkey braying]

15:59.094 --> 16:04.094
Donkey! Son of a...
[grunts in frustration]

16:04.231 --> 16:07.034
Come here. Here.
Get over here, you jackass!

16:07.067 --> 16:10.738
God damn it!
Brain the size of
a fucking walnut.

16:10.738 --> 16:14.042
Fucking ass! Hey!
I'm talking to you!

16:14.076 --> 16:19.076
You can run all you want,
stupid donkey.
I don't get tired.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.548
Looking for this?

16:21.581 --> 16:22.850
[Cliff] Who are you?

16:22.884 --> 16:24.219
Vic Stone.

16:24.219 --> 16:25.985
Some people call me Cyborg.

16:26.022 --> 16:27.154
Here to help.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.557
[Cliff] Nice eye.
You're in my way.

16:29.591 --> 16:32.461
-What's with the donkey?
-It sent us a message.

16:32.495 --> 16:34.397
Been chasing this fleabag
all morning.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.197
Full of some kind of secrets
or some shit.

16:36.230 --> 16:39.335
I saw footage of
you and your pals
messing up that diner.

16:39.368 --> 16:42.537
Wanna explain how
you managed to obliterate
the rest of the town?

16:42.571 --> 16:43.971
Oh, Cyborg!

16:44.004 --> 16:45.474
The guy who nobody asked
to be here,

16:45.508 --> 16:47.777
who pokes his nose
into business that ain't his!

16:47.807 --> 16:48.875
Hi.

16:48.909 --> 16:51.913
Man, you must be
one of Niles' strays.

16:51.947 --> 16:53.182
-You know the Chief?
-I do.

16:53.215 --> 16:54.750
Why didn't you say
you know the Chief?

16:54.783 --> 16:57.817
Because watching you
trying to be effective
is real distracting.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.522
-Where is he?
-He's gone.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.687
Ground opened up.

17:01.724 --> 17:03.259
Swallowed him
and the whole town.

17:03.292 --> 17:08.290
Our housemate Jane
tried to save him,
now she's gone, too.

17:08.630 --> 17:09.865
Sorry.

17:09.897 --> 17:12.432
-I just need
a second just to...
-Oh, no, go ahead. Yeah.

17:12.468 --> 17:13.768
...get this straight.

17:13.803 --> 17:15.304
[sighs]

17:15.336 --> 17:18.740
How does
a band of circus freaks
manage to screw up so badly

17:18.772 --> 17:22.576
that they lose their leader
and the whole entire town
at the same damn time?

17:22.612 --> 17:25.814
[Cliff] Hey,
Monday-morning QB, I don't
feel good about it either.

17:25.846 --> 17:27.048
Did you see who made the hole?

17:27.082 --> 17:28.652
[Cliff] I was busy
not getting swallowed by it.

17:28.682 --> 17:32.153
-Where's the hole now?
-It swallowed itself.

17:32.188 --> 17:33.855
Did you see anything useful?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.356
[Cliff] Yes, damn it!
The donkey!

17:35.390 --> 17:36.723
What's the donkey
got to do with it?

17:36.759 --> 17:39.428
[Cliff] That's what I'm
trying to figure out, asshole!

17:39.460 --> 17:42.308
[brays and retches]

17:46.933 --> 17:50.236
I take it that's Jane.

17:56.845 --> 17:59.847
[sighs]

17:59.881 --> 18:01.682
[door opens]

18:13.661 --> 18:15.365
Larry.

18:15.396 --> 18:18.401
I'm just, um,
borrowing some...

18:18.432 --> 18:21.701
Hmm. I don't know
what I'm doing.

18:21.737 --> 18:24.076
I thought you left.

18:25.508 --> 18:29.644
[Larry sighs]
I ran from you, you know.

18:29.678 --> 18:31.278
When you...

18:31.313 --> 18:33.816
-you know, in Cloverton.
-Mmm.

18:33.847 --> 18:36.785
You needed us.

18:36.817 --> 18:39.721
Me.

18:39.755 --> 18:40.990
[Larry sighs]

18:41.021 --> 18:46.021
I ran away
because I can't control
this thing inside of me.

18:47.261 --> 18:49.865
I would've run from me, too.

18:49.897 --> 18:54.897
If I could run from me
right now, I would. [chuckles]

19:00.509 --> 19:03.912
We don't have
to get involved.

19:03.944 --> 19:07.714
Especially if we
make things worse.

19:07.750 --> 19:11.652
-[Cliff] We got a live one!
-[door opens]

19:11.685 --> 19:13.488
Jane? What happened?

19:13.521 --> 19:15.057
[Cliff]
The donkey spit her out.

19:15.088 --> 19:16.924
-What?
-[Cliff] The donkey spit her out.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.661
You know, when he
says it twice like that,
it really does sound crazy.

19:20.694 --> 19:23.865
Name's Vic.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.866
Cyborg.

19:26.902 --> 19:28.103
From Detroit.

19:28.134 --> 19:32.173
So you're some sort of
big city hero?

19:32.207 --> 19:33.709
I wouldn't say that.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.478
Heroes never do.

19:35.509 --> 19:39.861
See? No need to get involved.

19:48.655 --> 19:52.558
[laughter]

19:52.594 --> 19:55.230
[Niles laughing]

19:55.262 --> 19:57.700
[Vic panting]

19:57.731 --> 20:00.433
[grunting in pain]

20:00.469 --> 20:04.204
-[sighs loudly]
-Whew. Got some wheels
there, Grandpa.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.643
So how did you
break your eye anyway, Vic?

20:06.673 --> 20:09.076
Catching bank robbers?
Busting gangs?

20:09.111 --> 20:11.814
[chuckles]
Protecting and serving.

20:11.846 --> 20:15.451
Dad thinks I got a real shot
at the Justice League
in about five years.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.652
Maybe sooner if I stay
on top of my training.

20:17.683 --> 20:18.987
[Niles] Is that so?

20:19.019 --> 20:20.387
How about you, old man?

20:20.423 --> 20:21.756
How come you're not
in the game?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.026
Who says I'm not?

20:23.057 --> 20:25.594
-Dad says you're more of
a social worker these days.
-Ha!

20:25.625 --> 20:27.896
You know,
taking in those strays,
putting them back together.

20:27.930 --> 20:31.732
Yeah, well,
not all battles are won
on the front lines, Vic.

20:31.768 --> 20:35.701
You know, you should
come out to Cloverton sometime
and see for yourself.

20:35.737 --> 20:38.204
I have room for you.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.576
There are people there
you might find

20:39.576 --> 20:42.308
far more interesting
than your street-level thugs.

20:42.344 --> 20:44.246
I've already got plans.

20:44.278 --> 20:46.078
Dad's plans?

20:53.054 --> 20:55.356
-[sobbing]
-[Cliff] Jane?

20:55.390 --> 20:57.490
I know you've
been through a lot,

20:57.527 --> 21:00.326
but I really need to know
what happened to Chief.

21:00.362 --> 21:02.698
-Jane?
-[faint shuffling]

21:02.698 --> 21:04.097
[as Silvia] Jane isn't here
right now.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.164
[gasps]

21:05.201 --> 21:07.469
Dead in his arms.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.637
Dead in his arms.
Dead in his arms.

21:10.673 --> 21:13.209
Dead in his arms.
Dead in his arms.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.777
Dead in his arms.
Dead in his arms.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.313
Is she saying Niles is dead?

21:18.346 --> 21:21.182
[Cliff] Jane,
did you see the Chief?

21:21.214 --> 21:26.214
-[Silvia] Dead in his arms.
-[Cliff] Jane?

21:27.221 --> 21:28.923
[scoffs]

21:28.959 --> 21:31.228
[as Hammerhead] You don't
care about the Chief.

21:31.259 --> 21:35.762
You just wanna blame him
for keeping you away from
the daughter you fucked up.

21:35.798 --> 21:38.097
-What is she talking about?
-[Cliff] Shut up.

21:38.134 --> 21:39.781
[screaming]

21:43.837 --> 21:45.204
Jane, stop that. Stop.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.839
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Jane--

21:46.875 --> 21:48.544
Don't fucking touch me.

21:48.576 --> 21:51.778
[as Scarlet Harlot]
Oh, please touch me.

21:51.813 --> 21:56.384
Please touch me. [moaning]

21:56.419 --> 21:59.020
[as Hammerhead]
You sackless Judas.

21:59.054 --> 22:03.392
What, did you screw the nanny
while your baby girl was
in the other goddamn room?

22:03.423 --> 22:06.394
You filthy-- [stifled stutter]

22:06.429 --> 22:10.000
[as Penny Farthing]
Dead in his arms.
Dead in his arms.

22:10.030 --> 22:13.902
[stutters]
Penny for your thoughts...
Oh, dear! Cheerio.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.002
[gasps]

22:15.036 --> 22:18.942
[sighs in relief]

22:18.972 --> 22:22.545
[as Hammerhead]
What are you two
shit-for-brains looking at?

22:22.576 --> 22:27.576
-Okay, Cliff,
can I talk to you a minute?
-[blows raspberry]

22:32.153 --> 22:35.990
Okay, um...

22:36.022 --> 22:37.326
How does she work exactly?

22:37.357 --> 22:40.228
[Cliff] Work?
She's not a fucking machine.

22:40.259 --> 22:41.596
And I have no idea.

22:41.630 --> 22:44.164
-You'd have to ask the Chief.
-Glad we cleared that up.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.901
Jane?

22:45.932 --> 22:48.067
[Cliff] I wouldn't...

22:48.103 --> 22:49.971
[gasps]

22:50.005 --> 22:51.605
[as Baby Doll] Oh, my gosh.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.875
I know who you are.
You're Cyborg.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.107
[Baby Doll squeals]

22:55.143 --> 22:56.243
[Cliff] Of course she does.

22:56.277 --> 22:58.480
In the flesh.
And you are?

22:58.512 --> 23:01.347
Uh, Baby Doll, duh.
I'm your biggest fan.

23:01.384 --> 23:05.884
[gasps] Whoa,
you are so cool.

23:06.887 --> 23:08.323
Way cooler than the Flash.

23:08.355 --> 23:10.326
[chuckles]

23:10.356 --> 23:12.294
You wanna know a secret?

23:12.326 --> 23:13.759
[whispers]
He's not even that fast.

23:13.795 --> 23:16.262
[giggles]

23:16.298 --> 23:21.298
-[Vic] Don't tell anybody.
-[giggles]

23:21.569 --> 23:25.038
What is that thing?

23:25.073 --> 23:26.339
That's Cliff.

23:26.375 --> 23:27.540
Is he scaring you?

23:27.576 --> 23:29.411
[Cliff] Really, buddy?

23:29.442 --> 23:33.182
It's so ugly.

23:33.213 --> 23:35.615
I don't want it here.
Make it leave.

23:35.652 --> 23:39.054
-[Cliff] Jane...
-Make it leave!

23:39.086 --> 23:43.125
Don't worry. I got this.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.460
[Cliff imitates mockingly]
"Don't worry. I got this."

23:45.493 --> 23:46.961
Punk-ass robo-tween.

23:46.996 --> 23:49.630
I don't really know anything
about Jane, really.

23:49.663 --> 23:50.713
Really?

24:17.557 --> 24:21.307
All right. Let's do this.

Hey. Hey, Baby Doll?

Do you think we could
talk about the Chief?

27:35.457 --> 27:38.228
[giggling]

27:38.259 --> 27:41.630
It would mean a lot to me
if you told me what happened.

What you saw when you went...
when you went away.

27:45.468 --> 27:47.933
Oh, I can't tell you that,
silly.

27:47.969 --> 27:49.170
Why not?

draw it for me?</i>

28:22.470 --> 28:25.271
[Jane] <i>I don't know.</i>

28:25.307 --> 28:30.307
[Niles] <i>You don't talk to her?</i>

28:30.679 --> 28:32.280
[Jane] <i>Not to Katy.</i>

28:32.314 --> 28:35.915
<i>The ones like Katy,
they keep to themselves.</i>

28:35.951 --> 28:40.355
[Vic] Baby Doll,
I need you to focus.

28:40.387 --> 28:41.756
Niles meant a lot to me.

28:41.789 --> 28:44.893
And I know he meant
a lot to you, too.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.362
Cliff told me
you dove after him.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.163
No.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.201
Mmm-mmm. No, I didn't.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.368
Baby Doll, no one's
gonna be mad at you.

28:53.402 --> 28:58.402
-Just tell me what you saw.
-I didn't see anything.

28:59.207 --> 29:01.343
Someone else did.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.243
[Vic] Who?

29:03.277 --> 29:06.816
Who saw something?

29:06.847 --> 29:09.719
[Baby Doll] Katy.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.153
Katy saw something.

29:11.185 --> 29:12.921
-Katy saw something.
-[Vic] Yeah. Katy...

29:12.953 --> 29:17.953
Okay, well, let's...
let's talk to Katy.

29:19.125 --> 29:24.125
<i>Why... does Katy stay so deep
in the Underground?</i>

29:28.336 --> 29:31.036
<i>Because...</i>

29:33.576 --> 29:38.576
<i>she doesn't like
to be interrogated.</i>

29:39.814 --> 29:41.762
[Cliff] Shit!

29:49.789 --> 29:52.160
Nobody wants to talk to Katy.

29:52.192 --> 29:53.961
[Vic] I do.

29:53.996 --> 29:58.996
I want to...
[chuckles softly]
I'd love to talk to Katy.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.337
[Cliff] Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

30:03.337 --> 30:04.538
Whoa, Katy!

30:04.570 --> 30:08.611
I was just trying to help!

30:08.643 --> 30:11.044
[Katy screeches]

30:25.460 --> 30:26.795
Not giving me
much choice here.

30:26.826 --> 30:30.877
-[elevator dings]
-[grunts]

30:32.298 --> 30:33.602
What gives, man?

30:33.634 --> 30:35.336
[Cliff] Don't hurt her.

30:35.371 --> 30:36.538
She's still Jane.

30:36.570 --> 30:41.371
Actually,
the name's Lucy Fugue.

30:43.045 --> 30:45.213
And you're the one
who wanted a fight.

30:45.247 --> 30:50.048
-[Cliff] Jane--
-[both groaning]

30:55.825 --> 30:57.660
Jane...

30:57.692 --> 31:01.163
Uh, Hammerhead... it's me.

31:01.195 --> 31:03.631
[as Hammerhead]
I know who you are, shit bag.

31:03.664 --> 31:07.366
[Cliff screams]

31:07.402 --> 31:12.075
[music playing on speakers]

31:12.106 --> 31:14.576
-Care to join me outside?
-Why?

31:14.607 --> 31:18.807
-[Cliff screams]
-[crashing]

31:20.347 --> 31:22.048
I could use some air.

31:22.085 --> 31:24.451
[Cliff grunting and groaning]

31:24.451 --> 31:26.020
[as Silvertongue]
Fuck you, you piece of shit.

31:26.020 --> 31:27.488
[Cliff] Oh, come on. Stop.

31:27.521 --> 31:29.423
You're so fucked.

31:29.457 --> 31:31.093
[Cliff] What?

31:31.125 --> 31:32.393
Shit!

31:32.428 --> 31:33.795
Hey, Jane, stop it!

31:33.826 --> 31:36.932
Come out.
Jane, are you in there?

31:36.963 --> 31:41.336
Are you in the Underground?

31:41.371 --> 31:46.371
What do you know
about the Underground?

31:46.973 --> 31:48.674
[Cliff] Not a lot.

31:48.710 --> 31:51.546
I know Chief was
trying to help you.

31:51.578 --> 31:56.250
Maybe...
Maybe I can help you, too.

31:56.286 --> 32:00.688
-[grunts]
-[Vic] Right on time, baby.

32:00.721 --> 32:02.459
[Cliff] I had that.

32:02.490 --> 32:05.861
If the word "fucked" had
landed an inch to the left,
it'd be in your brain.

32:05.894 --> 32:07.130
[Cliff] Back off, kid.

32:07.162 --> 32:11.097
Kid? I just saved
your rusty ass.

32:11.134 --> 32:16.134
You're even more stupid
than you look.

32:18.105 --> 32:20.209
[Larry] I can't get it
out of my head.

32:20.209 --> 32:22.076
Now, how does Jane go
into a hole in the ground

32:22.076 --> 32:23.278
and come out of a donkey?

32:23.313 --> 32:25.247
[Rita] Oh, God.
Please don't get us involved.

32:25.279 --> 32:27.347
I thought we were
on the same page here.

32:27.383 --> 32:29.585
We're the ones who
don't do anything.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.586
But, Rita, what if...

32:31.618 --> 32:34.588
What if the donkey
is a door?

32:34.622 --> 32:37.093
[Vic] That's what
I was wondering.

32:37.125 --> 32:40.394
Hmm. My scan says it's
a perfectly normal donkey.

32:40.429 --> 32:43.432
Thank God that's solved.
Mint juleps?

32:43.463 --> 32:46.468
Somebody's gotta step out
the science of this for me.

32:46.500 --> 32:47.603
[Larry] Science?

32:47.634 --> 32:48.836
What science?

32:48.871 --> 32:50.403
Here.

32:50.438 --> 32:52.339
Dimensions. Wormholes.

32:52.375 --> 32:54.942
Other buzzwords
from the two
theoretical physics books

32:54.977 --> 32:56.377
I read in the '50s.

32:56.411 --> 32:59.280
Not that I care, but
can't that thing inside of you

32:59.314 --> 33:01.615
tear a hole
into another dimension?

33:01.647 --> 33:03.116
[Larry sighs]
How should I know?

33:03.152 --> 33:04.920
It's a being of pure energy.

33:04.953 --> 33:08.655
Even if it knows something
about the other dimensions,
I don't.

33:08.691 --> 33:10.790
And we do not communicate.

33:10.826 --> 33:11.893
[Vic] Holy crap.

33:11.924 --> 33:15.865
What is it?

33:15.896 --> 33:18.500
This thing's throat
is a keyhole.

33:18.531 --> 33:20.769
The donkey is a door.

33:20.803 --> 33:22.470
Ugh, God. To what?

33:22.502 --> 33:24.637
Wherever Jane went?

33:24.673 --> 33:26.339
Where the Chief still is?

33:26.375 --> 33:28.442
Where an entire town
is still trapped.

33:28.478 --> 33:32.980
Or it's a perfectly
normal donkey.

33:33.012 --> 33:37.085
Okay, so let's
take a look inside.

33:37.118 --> 33:40.269
I can't get in there.

33:43.258 --> 33:44.759
Oh, no.

33:44.794 --> 33:45.928
No.

33:45.961 --> 33:48.063
Under no circumstances.

33:48.096 --> 33:49.731
Rita, I've seen what you
can do with your body.

33:49.731 --> 33:53.536
No. You've seen
what happens to my body
when it gets stressed out.

33:53.567 --> 33:55.505
And do you know what's
stressing me out right now?

33:55.505 --> 34:00.076
The idea of shoving my face
down the slimy throat
of a diseased animal.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.509
Is this funny to you?

34:01.544 --> 34:03.645
Does my humiliation
get your blood pumping?

34:03.645 --> 34:05.445
I'd like to know what
you're picturing right now.

34:05.445 --> 34:08.318
Are you going to shove me
in a sack, hmm? A trash bag?

34:08.349 --> 34:11.786
Cut a little hole so you
can squeeze me into
that syphilitic beast

34:11.820 --> 34:13.355
like a tube of toothpaste?

34:13.389 --> 34:15.625
Push my eye into a funnel
and force me into the bowels

34:15.657 --> 34:20.657
of a braying shit-factory
without my consent?

34:21.130 --> 34:24.833
Would that work?

34:24.867 --> 34:29.067
I am a Golden Globe nominee.

34:30.237 --> 34:33.242
-[door closes]
-Treat me like some
carnival grotesque.

34:33.275 --> 34:36.210
I was the lead in
<i>Cupid Knocks Thrice.</i>

34:36.246 --> 34:40.849
Tell me she's given up
something about the Chief,
or the townies, or whatever.

34:40.882 --> 34:44.920
[Cliff] See for yourself.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.121
I think she's getting worse.

34:47.155 --> 34:48.922
You were right, Rita.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.592
I have no clue
how to fix this.

34:51.626 --> 34:54.925
I'm fucking powerless.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.599
Oh, for the love of God.

34:59.635 --> 35:02.483
I need a trash bag.

35:06.643 --> 35:10.746
Whether the weather be cold,
or whether the weather
be hot...

35:10.777 --> 35:12.179
Whether the weather be cold...

35:12.215 --> 35:13.782
[Vic] What is she doing?

35:13.817 --> 35:16.485
[Larry sighs] I don't know.
Rita needs to emote
in order to blob.

35:16.518 --> 35:18.952
...whether the weather
be hot...

35:18.987 --> 35:21.456
Let's set some ground rules.

35:21.489 --> 35:25.027
One, during this
entire ordeal, nobody is
allowed to look at me.

35:25.061 --> 35:30.061
Two, when I am in the bag,
you will only squeeze me
as I ask to be squeezed.

35:30.331 --> 35:33.568
Three, when I see
whatever is in
this disgusting keyhole,

35:33.603 --> 35:38.438
you will immediately
pull me out and we will
never speak of this again.

35:38.472 --> 35:40.871
Cone of silence.

35:43.510 --> 35:44.880
[sighs]

35:44.913 --> 35:46.447
[squelching]

35:46.481 --> 35:51.481
[Rita] Ew. Ew.
Ew, ew, ew, ew. Oh, ew.

35:52.018 --> 35:54.889
Oh, God.
It's slimy, it stinks.

35:54.925 --> 35:58.193
[Larry] Just FYI, if I vomit,
I have no choice
but to choke on it.

35:58.226 --> 36:02.130
[Rita] Stop talking!
I'm almost in.

36:02.163 --> 36:05.967
Oh, my! It's beautiful.

36:06.001 --> 36:07.668
Rita, what do you see?

36:07.702 --> 36:10.737
[Larry] Um, problem...

36:10.773 --> 36:11.773
Rita, you're slipping.

36:11.773 --> 36:14.175
[Rita] They're in here,
they're all in here!

36:14.210 --> 36:16.244
-[Vic] Rita!
-[Rita] Oh, God!

36:16.277 --> 36:18.947
-Rita! Rita!

36:18.980 --> 36:21.715
-[Vic grunts]
-[donkey brays]

36:21.750 --> 36:23.885
-Oh, no!
-[Larry] What?

36:23.918 --> 36:25.487
We're going in!

36:25.518 --> 36:27.619
[both yelling]

36:37.764 --> 36:39.202
[Vic] Help me out here.

36:39.233 --> 36:40.835
I'm inside a donkey or what?

36:40.871 --> 36:44.773
[Larry] The question is,
how do we get outside
the donkey?

36:44.806 --> 36:46.675
Oh, my God.

36:46.708 --> 36:48.958
It's Cloverton.

37:05.027 --> 37:08.476
No way out but forward.

37:23.978 --> 37:26.081

<i>First up,

<i>Small town America,

37:48.536 --> 37:51.106
<i>Bored of our pretension yet?</i>

37:51.139 --> 37:52.942
<i>Next, in the center
of the gallery,</i>

37:52.974 --> 37:54.577
<i>our newest
interactive exhibit.</i>

37:54.610 --> 37:57.679
<i>These three meat puppets
will be performing

37:57.713 --> 38:00.416
<i>of their search
for their fearless leader.</i>

38:00.449 --> 38:02.786
[Larry] Uh...
Is he talking about us?

38:02.818 --> 38:04.987
[Mr. Nobody]
Our radioactive fly boy asked,

38:05.018 --> 38:07.855
<i>hoping desperately that
Cyborg would take charge.</i>

38:07.889 --> 38:09.326
This is crazy.

38:09.358 --> 38:12.327
[Mr. Nobody] <i>Cyborg exclaimed,
as if it even need to be said.</i>

38:12.362 --> 38:17.362
<i>Rita opened her mouth
even though she had
nothing to contribute.</i>

38:18.934 --> 38:22.335
<i>The trio continued onward,
eager for an exclusive look</i>

38:22.371 --> 38:27.371
<i>at what the Chief was up to
at this very moment.</i>

38:28.344 --> 38:33.344
<i>The trio continued onward.</i>

38:40.755 --> 38:43.304
[Cliff squeaking]

38:56.871 --> 38:58.373
[laughs] Daddy.

38:58.407 --> 39:01.911
I got it, I got it.
No crust.

39:01.943 --> 39:04.911
[imitates Clara]
Crusts are gross.
Don't make me eat them.

39:04.947 --> 39:06.447
No crusts.

39:14.356 --> 39:16.157
Oh, fuck me.

39:21.063 --> 39:22.130
House special.

39:22.163 --> 39:25.000
Crustless PB and J triangles.

39:25.032 --> 39:28.001
[as Baby Doll]
Oh, wow. Thanks.

39:28.036 --> 39:30.773
[faint shuffling]

39:30.806 --> 39:32.675
[as Hammerhead]
Too bad three of us
are gluten-free,

39:32.708 --> 39:34.809
twelve of us are allergic
to peanut butter

39:34.844 --> 39:39.844

39:50.760 --> 39:54.295
[Mr. Nobody] <i>As they
approached the canvases,

<i>futility.</i>

40:11.413 --> 40:12.748
This isn't real.

40:12.782 --> 40:16.318
[director] Of course not.
It's Hollywood, baby.

40:16.351 --> 40:19.822
[Mr. Nobody] <i>Who's to say
what's real, anyway?</i>

40:19.855 --> 40:22.090
<i>In Rita's heart,
something sparked.</i>

40:22.123 --> 40:23.559
Do you hear that voice?

40:23.592 --> 40:27.496
Ha! You're a riot, Rita.
Jeez, I don't
gotta do nothing.

40:27.527 --> 40:29.731
-You're gorgeous.
-Your skin is just glowing.

40:29.764 --> 40:33.536
I mean, you are radiant.
I... I'm jealous of you.
What's your secret?

40:33.568 --> 40:35.335
[Mr. Nobody] <i>A desire,
an old thirst.</i>

40:35.371 --> 40:38.273

40:38.306 --> 40:42.143
<i>Dream or not,

and she was the star.</i>

40:42.177 --> 40:45.777
Damn right I'm the star.

41:19.983 --> 41:22.016
<i>Grab the stick.
You know you want to.</i>

41:22.050 --> 41:23.251
[rattling]

41:23.284 --> 41:26.721
<i>You know you have to.</i>

41:26.755 --> 41:28.255
[grunting]

41:28.289 --> 41:29.789
[rumbling]

41:33.827 --> 41:35.197
[Mr. Nobody] <i>Yes!</i>

41:35.230 --> 41:38.532
<i>Our hotshot test pilot
is back.</i>

41:38.568 --> 41:40.666
Whoo! [laughs]

41:44.940 --> 41:48.478
[Mr. Nobody]
<i>And as for Cyborg,
this wasn't his first rodeo.</i>

41:48.510 --> 41:52.947
<i>He wouldn't be
so easily seduced
by self-indulgent fantasies.</i>

41:52.981 --> 41:54.684
<i>Which is great,
because it frees me up</i>

41:54.715 --> 41:57.751
<i>to skip straight
to the torture, right, Victor?</i>

41:57.786 --> 42:00.121
You bastard.

42:00.152 --> 42:02.190
[groaning in pain]

42:02.224 --> 42:04.724
[panting]

42:04.760 --> 42:06.260
[grunting]

42:12.034 --> 42:14.969
[Mr. Nobody] <i>Young Victor's
pain was intense.</i>

42:15.003 --> 42:17.039
<i>It was all he could do
not to shit himself to death</i>

42:17.072 --> 42:19.108
<i>right there
on the Stone family yard.</i>

42:19.139 --> 42:20.510
Screw you!

42:20.543 --> 42:22.710
[Mr. Nobody]
<i>But that was nothing
compared to the pain he felt</i>

42:22.746 --> 42:27.746
<i>when he remembered
his mother was with him
when the explosion happened.</i>

42:28.081 --> 42:30.585
[Vic] No. No!

42:30.585 --> 42:34.289
This is not real!

42:34.322 --> 42:35.489
Who are you?

42:35.523 --> 42:37.728
[Mr. Nobody] <i>You'll find out
soon enough.</i>

42:37.760 --> 42:42.530
<i>But at the moment,
I'm interested in a much more
complex question, Victor.</i>

42:42.563 --> 42:46.563
<i>Namely, who are you?</i>

42:48.969 --> 42:51.070
[soft humming]

43:02.349 --> 43:06.221
[continues humming]

43:06.255 --> 43:09.157
[Jane as Penny Farthing]
Dead in his arms.
Dead in his arms.

43:09.190 --> 43:10.693
A penny...

43:10.724 --> 43:15.197
[Cliff] Great stuff, Jane...
or whoever.

43:15.230 --> 43:17.364
I know you
don't want to talk,

43:17.398 --> 43:21.835
but I have some questions
I gotta ask.

43:21.871 --> 43:24.273
Why did you turn
that bus around for me?

43:24.304 --> 43:26.943
I don't...
I don't deserve that.

43:26.974 --> 43:28.643
I just found out
my daughter's alive

43:28.679 --> 43:33.679
and all I can think about is
how shitty her last memories
of me must be.

43:33.949 --> 43:38.652
I was so mad at the Chief
for keeping her from me,
but the truth is...

43:38.688 --> 43:41.023
I don't deserve to see her.

43:41.056 --> 43:44.059
So what's the point of hurting you,
just to find Chief?

43:44.094 --> 43:47.630
I don't want
to cause you more pain.

43:47.630 --> 43:48.996
I'll never know
what kind of trauma

43:48.996 --> 43:53.202
makes a girl split herself
apart so many times.

43:53.233 --> 43:54.835
[squeaking]

43:54.835 --> 43:56.572
We don't have to talk
about the Underground,

43:56.572 --> 44:00.742
or your life,
or anything, just...

44:00.777 --> 44:05.081
I just want you to feel safe.

44:05.114 --> 44:09.050
[Jane] Would you make me
another sandwich?

44:09.083 --> 44:10.117
[Cliff] Yeah.

44:10.152 --> 44:11.621
[director] And, action.

44:11.652 --> 44:14.956
[Mr. Nobody] <i>Like riding
a bicycle, Rita knew
how to hit her marks,</i>

44:14.989 --> 44:18.559
<i>find her light,
sell the drama.
This was it!</i>

44:18.594 --> 44:20.262
<i>This was her Oscar moment.</i>

44:20.295 --> 44:22.364
[in Southern accent]
But I never had no momma.

44:22.398 --> 44:26.402
So I never knew
that boys could be so mean,
so cruel.

44:26.434 --> 44:30.072
[sobs] And now
this baby's gonna grow up
not knowing her daddy.

44:30.105 --> 44:33.643
[Mr. Nobody] <i>In other words,
Rita's an idiot.</i>

44:33.675 --> 44:38.675
And I, I see her daddy
in her little eyes, and...

44:39.081 --> 44:40.581
I resent her.

44:40.614 --> 44:45.614
[sobbing] I resent
her sweet angel face.

44:46.188 --> 44:50.893
[Mr. Nobody] <i>I mean,
she knows this is a trap,
and still she plays along.</i>

44:50.925 --> 44:52.693
[in normal tone]
What else am I supposed to do?

44:52.728 --> 44:56.030
-Cut.
-No, wait.

44:56.030 --> 44:56.931
[Rita gasps]

44:56.931 --> 44:58.934
[Mr. Nobody]
<i>Ah, the desperation.</i>

44:58.967 --> 45:01.505
<i>Still she clings
to her faded glory.</i>

45:01.536 --> 45:04.373
Whoever you are,
you can shut the fuck up.
You don't know me.

45:04.407 --> 45:08.577
[Mr. Nobody]
<i>Oh, but I do, Rita Farr.
I know your whole story.</i>

45:08.610 --> 45:12.880
[baby crying]

45:12.914 --> 45:15.452
<i>I know all your stories.</i>

45:15.483 --> 45:20.483
<i>I know what drove you
into the sky over
and over again, Larry.</i>

45:21.188 --> 45:22.556
I wanted to be a hero.

45:22.590 --> 45:24.992
[Mr. Nobody]
<i>A hero or a hypocrite?</i>

45:25.027 --> 45:26.929
<i>Because that's what
you really were.</i>

45:26.960 --> 45:28.898
-You don't know me.
-[Mr. Nobody] <i>Oh, really?</i>

45:28.929 --> 45:32.201
<i>I know flying is just
another word for fleeing.</i>

45:32.233 --> 45:33.835
<i>Just ask your wife.</i>

45:33.869 --> 45:35.871
Larry, when are you
coming home?

45:35.902 --> 45:37.539
The boys miss their daddy.

45:37.572 --> 45:39.309
I wasn't running away
from my family.

45:39.340 --> 45:43.478
[Mr. Nobody] <i>Right!
You were running from
your family and your lover.</i>

45:43.510 --> 45:44.947
I don't have to be
the one you choose.

45:44.947 --> 45:46.514
But you have to
make a choice.

45:46.550 --> 45:48.818
[Mr. Nobody] <i>But you
couldn't even do that,
could you, Larry?</i>

45:48.849 --> 45:50.585
<i>Instead,
you just stayed the course.</i>

45:50.585 --> 45:53.722
<i>And the suckers
who loved you the most
paid the price.</i>

45:53.755 --> 45:55.523
[John screams]

45:55.556 --> 45:58.393
Larry! Larry!

45:58.425 --> 46:01.730
[alarm beeping]

46:01.764 --> 46:03.500
[Mr. Nobody] <i>And how do you
call yourself a hero</i>

46:03.500 --> 46:07.568
<i>when your mother died
in a lab accident
you caused?</i>

46:07.603 --> 46:09.204
You don't get it.

46:09.237 --> 46:13.208
You think forcing me
to relive this is torture?

46:13.242 --> 46:16.710
I relive this
every time I go to sleep.

46:16.746 --> 46:20.248
I relive this
when I close my eyes.

46:20.282 --> 46:22.085
You may know who I am,

46:22.085 --> 46:24.952
but you don't know
shit about me.

46:24.987 --> 46:28.989
If you did, you would know
that every criminal I bust

46:29.023 --> 46:32.393
and every person I save,
is me fulfilling a pledge
to my mom

46:32.427 --> 46:35.697
that she'll never get to hear.

46:35.730 --> 46:39.480
Trying to make her proud.

46:41.237 --> 46:46.175
Knowing I'm the reason
she's not around to see it.

46:46.206 --> 46:50.143
That's my burden.

46:50.179 --> 46:54.684
That's what it means
to be Cyborg.

46:54.715 --> 46:58.188
[Mr. Nobody]
<i>What an origin story!</i>

46:58.219 --> 47:03.219
<i>Wow! Too bad
it's a load of donkey shit.</i>

47:03.626 --> 47:05.992
What's that supposed
to mean?

47:06.027 --> 47:07.027
Hey!

47:07.063 --> 47:08.230
-[Mr. Nobody] <i>You are wrong...
-[baby crying]</i>

47:08.230 --> 47:10.867
<i>...so wrong,
to doubt the narrator.</i>

47:10.898 --> 47:14.469
<i>I mean, I'm the narrator.
Think about that.</i>

47:14.503 --> 47:17.938
<i>-I exist outside
of time and space.
-[baby continues crying]</i>

47:17.974 --> 47:20.509
<i>I know your past,
present, and future.</i>

47:20.541 --> 47:24.045
Please... don't do this to me.

47:24.079 --> 47:26.148
[Mr. Nobody]
<i>I know what you did.</i>

47:26.181 --> 47:28.416
<i>What you are willing to do.</i>

47:28.451 --> 47:33.021
<i>So, if you don't want
your sad, solipsistic,
utterly useless lives</i>

47:33.054 --> 47:34.856
<i>dissected in front
of the world,</i>

47:34.889 --> 47:38.994

<i>-you're the most
tragic one of all.
-[gasps]</i>

47:43.197 --> 47:46.568
You don't even have memories.
You have programming.

47:46.601 --> 47:49.268

Get out of my head!

47:49.304 --> 47:50.407
Get out of my head!

47:50.438 --> 47:52.974
-Are you talking to me,
or to your father?
-[grunts]

47:53.009 --> 47:55.844
Either way,
you're on the right track.

47:55.876 --> 47:59.481
[screaming in pain]

47:59.514 --> 48:03.251
The worst thing
about not knowing
your own past...

48:03.284 --> 48:05.188
[screaming]

48:05.219 --> 48:08.757
...is that you're doomed
to repeat it.

48:08.791 --> 48:10.525
[crying in pain]

48:10.559 --> 48:13.193
Who are you?

48:13.228 --> 48:16.697
Me? I'm Nobody.

48:16.731 --> 48:20.335
Help! Help me, Larry!

48:20.367 --> 48:22.505
Larry!

48:22.538 --> 48:25.340
[Mr. Nobody] <i>Go ahead, Larry.
Save the day.</i>

48:25.373 --> 48:27.076
<i>That's what heroes do.</i>

48:27.108 --> 48:29.311
<i>But, of course
you never were a hero.</i>

48:29.344 --> 48:32.146
<i>No wonder you resent
the thing inside you so much.</i>

48:32.179 --> 48:34.416
[grunting]

48:34.451 --> 48:39.121
<i>A-ha! Your deus ex
is right on time.</i>

48:39.152 --> 48:43.559
<i>The sight of him
helplessly flailing about
to free you all</i>

48:43.590 --> 48:45.693
<i>is so stirring. Ugh!</i>

48:45.728 --> 48:49.331
<i>You can thank this glowing baby bird
for ending your torture early,</i>

48:49.362 --> 48:51.431
<i>but don't forget,</i>

48:51.465 --> 48:55.570
you're all at my mercy.

49:40.882 --> 49:44.483
[gasps, exhales sharply]

49:55.530 --> 49:57.032
[Vic] You two okay?

49:57.065 --> 49:59.969
Not in the slightest.

50:00.001 --> 50:02.804
-[Larry] What was that?
-A warning.

50:02.838 --> 50:05.706
-Think you might have
saved us, Larry.
-[door opening]

50:05.739 --> 50:07.409
[Larry] I didn't do anything.

50:07.443 --> 50:09.844
Thank that thing
inside of you for me.

50:09.878 --> 50:10.911
Whatever it is.

50:10.947 --> 50:12.179
[Cliff]
What the hell happened?

50:12.179 --> 50:13.782
The donkey was a door.

50:13.815 --> 50:17.818
-What?
-The donkey was a door.

50:17.853 --> 50:20.521
I see what you did there,
and I hate you.

50:20.554 --> 50:22.056
Well, thank God you got out.

50:22.090 --> 50:23.791
I could've told you
it was a trap.

50:23.826 --> 50:25.795
Oh, good. Jane's back.

50:25.795 --> 50:26.996
[Cliff]
Any sign of the Chief?

50:26.996 --> 50:28.197
We know he's alive.

50:28.230 --> 50:29.965
And we met
the bastard who took him.

50:29.998 --> 50:31.800
Calls himself Nobody.

50:31.833 --> 50:34.237
[Cliff] Nobody?
That's less than helpful.

50:34.268 --> 50:36.204
The good news is,
he's scared of us.

50:36.237 --> 50:38.206
-He's scared of us?
-[Vic] Yeah.

50:38.239 --> 50:40.943
This is how I know
we're onto something.

50:40.976 --> 50:43.746
Why else would Nobody
lay a trap,

50:43.777 --> 50:47.215
make threats,
mess with our heads?

50:47.250 --> 50:50.684
[scoffs]
That's not omniscient.

50:50.719 --> 50:52.521
That's insecure.

50:52.554 --> 50:55.623
-In fact, all we need--
-[Silas] Victor!

50:55.657 --> 51:00.460
[car door shuts]

51:00.496 --> 51:05.032
Dad?

51:05.067 --> 51:09.605
[Cliff] Someone's in trouble.

51:09.639 --> 51:12.375
So much for privacy mode.
How did you find me?

51:12.407 --> 51:15.710
When you vanish
from the face of the Earth,
I get a damn notification.

51:15.742 --> 51:17.277
What happened?

51:17.313 --> 51:19.380
I could try to explain,
but the science
really wouldn't hold up.

51:19.414 --> 51:22.050
Where's Niles?
Did he talk you
into coming here?

51:22.083 --> 51:24.418
He's gone, Dad.

51:24.452 --> 51:25.889
He's in trouble.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.389
Well, whatever
he's gotten himself into,
he can figure his own way out.

51:28.422 --> 51:30.157
He always does.
We're going home.

51:30.193 --> 51:33.027
-Dad...
-This is not a job for Cyborg.

51:33.061 --> 51:35.496
The work
we're doing in Detroit
is important.

51:35.530 --> 51:37.666
It means something.

51:37.699 --> 51:39.135
It's gonna get you noticed.

51:39.166 --> 51:42.268
Catapult you
to bigger and better things.

51:42.304 --> 51:46.742
And even if it doesn't,
it means something to me.

51:46.773 --> 51:50.010
And your mom.

51:50.045 --> 51:52.715
Every criminal we bust,

51:52.746 --> 51:55.016
every person we save,

51:55.050 --> 52:00.050
is us fulfilling a pledge
to your mom.

52:00.621 --> 52:02.190
Doing her proud.

52:02.190 --> 52:04.791
That's our burden, Vic.

52:04.827 --> 52:09.827
That's what it means
to be Cyborg.

52:10.931 --> 52:13.434
You should go home.

52:13.469 --> 52:15.503
I'm staying here
until I find Niles Caulder.

52:15.536 --> 52:18.304
Like hell you are.

52:18.340 --> 52:20.443
You...

52:20.474 --> 52:24.143
You've been here a day,
you're covered in slime,

52:24.179 --> 52:29.179
palling around with a bunch
of inept circus freaks.

52:29.384 --> 52:32.188
Vic...

52:32.219 --> 52:34.789
you get your act together,

52:34.822 --> 52:37.326
I will upgrade you.

52:37.358 --> 52:41.730
Turn you into
a godlike force for good.

52:41.764 --> 52:45.568
[scoffs]
I need a couple of days
to figure this out.

52:45.601 --> 52:47.869
I'll check in on schedule.
Don't worry about me.

52:47.902 --> 52:50.706
-I always do.
-Why?

52:50.737 --> 52:53.641
[scoffs]

52:53.675 --> 52:57.911
I'm Cyborg... right?

52:57.947 --> 53:01.581

53:12.827 --> 53:14.626
[door beeps]

54:28.501 --> 54:29.552
[sighs]

54:35.143 --> 54:37.813
I'm supposed to thank you.

54:37.844 --> 54:39.045
[scoffs]

55:03.838 --> 55:06.942
Okay.

55:06.974 --> 55:09.077
You can do it.

55:09.110 --> 55:12.179
[sighs heavily]

55:12.213 --> 55:14.463
You'll wake up.

55:17.987 --> 55:21.822
You'll wake up.

55:21.856 --> 55:23.206
[exhales]

56:02.264 --> 56:03.398
Oh.

56:03.431 --> 56:08.237
Uh, sorry, I'm...
looking for a guest room.

56:08.268 --> 56:10.472
Well, this isn't some motel.

56:10.505 --> 56:13.509
You'll have to pick up
after yourself. Chip in.

56:13.541 --> 56:15.744
I think I can handle that.

56:15.777 --> 56:20.777
Guest room
is last door on the right.

56:23.318 --> 56:27.021
You did good today, Rita.

56:27.054 --> 56:30.425
I know it was hard, but, um...

56:30.458 --> 56:35.297
Just... You were a star today.

56:35.331 --> 56:39.081
Damn right you're a star.

56:41.170 --> 56:42.603
[music continues playing]
