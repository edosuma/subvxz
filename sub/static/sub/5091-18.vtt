This is my brother, Danny.

09:09.102 --> 09:13.155
Lyle is, um, very familiar
with Salazar.

09:13.156 --> 09:15.140
Very familiar, and
very unsuccessful.

09:15.141 --> 09:16.775
Salazar's still
on the street.

09:16.776 --> 09:19.311
And subtlety is not
his strong suit.

09:19.312 --> 09:20.646
Must run in the family.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.115
Salazar has been
on our radar

09:23.116 --> 09:24.550
since over a year ago,

09:24.551 --> 09:27.119
when cheap Peruvian powder
starting flooding the city.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.038
We haven't been able
to directly link him

09:29.039 --> 09:30.489
to the drug supply.

09:30.490 --> 09:32.825
And we've never found a witness
willing to testify against him.

09:32.826 --> 09:34.894
I guess today's your
lucky day, then.

09:34.895 --> 09:37.296
Our Peruvian counterparts
tell us he has a history

09:37.297 --> 09:39.531
of torturing and killing
potential witnesses

09:39.532 --> 09:40.883
in his home country.

09:40.884 --> 09:43.435
This was the body of a
lieutenant in his organization

09:43.436 --> 09:45.387
who agreed to testify
against Salazar.

09:45.388 --> 09:48.040
He was killed,
in broad daylight, in Lima,

09:48.041 --> 09:49.074
by one of Salazar's men.

09:49.075 --> 09:51.710
Not a single witness
would come forward.

09:51.711 --> 09:52.845
Until now.

09:52.846 --> 09:55.080

It was him.

09:55.081 --> 09:56.515
It was dark.
You were under fire.

09:56.516 --> 09:58.367
I just told you. It was him.

09:58.368 --> 10:00.119
That's how Salazar's lawyers
are going to go after you

10:00.120 --> 10:01.520
on the stand,
if you find him.

10:01.521 --> 10:04.189

He's constantly on the move.

10:04.190 --> 10:06.558
He never stays more than one
night in the same place.

10:06.559 --> 10:09.662
He changes his addresses
and vehicles like underwear.

10:09.663 --> 10:12.131
I tell you what.
When I lock his ass up,

10:12.132 --> 10:14.533
I'll know exactly
where to find him.

10:15.535 --> 10:17.720
Is that the DEA transcripts
and tracking data?

10:17.721 --> 10:18.904
Right. All here.

10:18.905 --> 10:21.540
You know the one thing
I can't figure out?

10:21.541 --> 10:23.676
Is why a kingpin like Salazar
would go to the effort

10:23.677 --> 10:25.778
of doing a hit on a clean
kid like David Taylor?

10:25.779 --> 10:27.980
I mean, wouldn't he use
one of his gang to do it?

10:27.981 --> 10:30.115
Well, there is a connection.

10:30.116 --> 10:32.318
According to the DEA, Mark
Taylor, the victim's brother,

10:32.319 --> 10:34.086
was suspected
of funneling money

10:34.087 --> 10:37.856
from El Mal into money market
accounts on Wall Street.

10:37.857 --> 10:40.693
But we never found proof
of that.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.395
Keep me posted.

10:43.396 --> 10:45.414
Thank you.

10:48.084 --> 10:49.335
Look, I know what
you're going to say.

10:49.336 --> 10:50.586
I'll be nicer next time.

10:50.587 --> 10:53.539
No, I like that you don't
sugarcoat anything.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.424
It's refreshing after
a full day of lawyers.

10:55.425 --> 10:57.459
What I wanted to say was...

10:57.460 --> 10:58.944
I'm glad you're okay.

10:58.945 --> 11:02.298
Aw... Sis. See?

11:02.299 --> 11:04.767
I knew all that playing Superman as
kids would work out.

11:04.768 --> 11:06.752
I'm bulletproof still.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.988
Yeah, well, Salazar thinks
he's bulletproof, too.

11:08.989 --> 11:11.957
Be careful.
I will.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.196
Thanks for coming down,
Mr. Taylor.

11:17.197 --> 11:19.198
We've identified the person
who killed your brother.

11:19.199 --> 11:20.866
Who was it?

11:20.867 --> 11:22.067
Raymundo Salazar.

11:22.068 --> 11:24.903
We'd like for you
to help us find him.

11:24.904 --> 11:26.805
We have been checking
out his known haunts,

11:26.806 --> 11:28.574
and we're coming up dry.

11:28.575 --> 11:29.742
I'm sorry.
I don't, uh,

11:29.743 --> 11:31.844
I don't know
who that is.

11:31.845 --> 11:33.278
Yes, you do.

11:33.279 --> 11:34.513
You launder money
for him.

11:34.514 --> 11:36.715
No, I don't.

11:36.716 --> 11:38.417
Yeah, you do.
What happened,

11:38.418 --> 11:40.302
your Wall Street bonuses weren't
enough for you?

11:41.554 --> 11:44.723
If you had any proof, the SEC
would already have my license

11:44.724 --> 11:46.458
and I would be in jail.

11:46.459 --> 11:48.977
Come on, Mark, this guy's
a major drug kingpin

11:48.978 --> 11:50.596
who killed your brother,
a clean kid.

11:50.597 --> 11:52.831
Why would he do that
if it wasn't personal, hmm?

11:52.832 --> 11:54.566
If it was personal,

11:54.567 --> 11:56.635
then it probably had
something to do with you.

11:56.636 --> 12:00.155
What were you doing, Mark,
stealing money from Salazar?

12:00.156 --> 12:01.407
No!

12:01.408 --> 12:03.475
You know, I watched him
kill your brother.

12:03.476 --> 12:05.644
Your brother died in my arms.

12:05.645 --> 12:08.146
Hey, look at me.

12:08.147 --> 12:11.450
You gonna let this guy
get away with that?

12:11.451 --> 12:14.586
You gonna help us find
his killer?

12:16.723 --> 12:20.008
Look, I don't know why Raymundo
Salazar killed my brother.

12:20.009 --> 12:21.460
Yes, you do.

12:21.461 --> 12:25.230
Look, then just tell us
where to find him.

12:29.018 --> 12:32.237
If he knew I told you anything,
he would kill me, too.

12:32.238 --> 12:33.439
Do the right thing,
Mark.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.006
You don't want to do it for us,

12:35.007 --> 12:37.059
you don't want to do it
for your dead brother,

12:37.060 --> 12:38.744
do it for your brokenhearted
mother, okay?

12:38.745 --> 12:41.179
Tell us where to find him.

12:44.751 --> 12:47.486
When he comes to New York,

12:47.487 --> 12:51.323
Salazar, sometimes he stays
with a girlfriend in Harlem.

12:51.324 --> 12:53.525
Her name is Sylvia.

12:53.526 --> 12:55.794
Where do we find this Sylvia?

12:56.863 --> 13:01.934
She works at a barbershop
on 125th Street.

13:15.047 --> 13:17.850
Sylvia, police.
Keep walking.

13:17.851 --> 13:19.718
I need to ask you
some questions

13:19.719 --> 13:21.019
about your boyfriend
Raymundo Salazar.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.220
Never heard of him.

13:22.221 --> 13:24.123
Maybe I'll refresh your memory.
Get in the car.

13:24.124 --> 13:26.925
Come on, get inside.

13:26.926 --> 13:28.243
Come on.
Scoot over.

13:28.244 --> 13:31.747
All right, Raymundo Salazar.

13:31.748 --> 13:32.865
I never seen
him before.

13:32.866 --> 13:34.199
Oh, you never seen him.
No.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.334
Okay, well,
maybe you've seen

13:35.335 --> 13:36.785
some of his victims,
like this guy.

13:36.786 --> 13:39.121
He was doused in gasoline
and set on fire.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.707
And then there's this guy,
he was buried alive.

13:41.708 --> 13:45.477
Maybe you've seen his latest
victim, David Taylor.

13:49.449 --> 13:50.415
Oh, you know him?

13:50.416 --> 13:52.818
No.
Really?

13:52.819 --> 13:54.520
Salazar shot him in the chest,
killed him.

13:56.890 --> 13:59.057
Strange,

13:59.058 --> 14:00.959
but when David died in my arms
the other night,

14:00.960 --> 14:03.228
he had the same bracelet
on as you.

14:03.229 --> 14:05.197
What a coincidence.

14:05.198 --> 14:06.999
Did he give you that bracelet?

14:09.102 --> 14:10.619
So you and David Taylor
are together?

14:11.988 --> 14:13.455
You tell us
about it here

14:13.456 --> 14:16.274
or we're gonna have
to take you down to the station,

14:16.275 --> 14:18.577
you can tell us there.

14:18.578 --> 14:20.679
We'll take her down
to the station.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.998
No.

14:22.999 --> 14:24.216
Wait.

14:24.217 --> 14:26.685
No, no, no,
we're going to the station.

14:26.686 --> 14:29.788
I met David a few months ago
at a party,

14:29.789 --> 14:31.857
at his brother's place.

14:31.858 --> 14:33.458
Mark Taylor.

14:33.459 --> 14:37.062
Started talking and told him
I want to get my GED.

14:37.063 --> 14:38.964
He started tutoring me.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.799
He's really sweet.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.734
So cute, you know?

14:42.735 --> 14:44.503
He's so funny.

14:44.504 --> 14:46.838
You ever meet someone like that?

14:46.839 --> 14:52.010
Someone you just want
to be with all the time?

14:52.011 --> 14:54.580
Yeah, I married her.
So what happened?

14:54.581 --> 14:56.715
Salazar find out
about you and David?

14:56.716 --> 14:59.952
Yeah. He started asking
questions about David.

14:59.953 --> 15:01.853
Told him he was
just tutoring me,

15:01.854 --> 15:04.256
but told me not to see him
anymore.

15:04.257 --> 15:05.524
And did you?

15:05.525 --> 15:07.059
No.

15:09.195 --> 15:12.514
Couldn't.

15:12.515 --> 15:14.967
Thought we could keep it
a secret, but...

15:18.738 --> 15:20.606
Can't keep secrets
from a guy like Salazar.

15:20.607 --> 15:22.975
Why don't you tell us
where we could find him?

15:22.976 --> 15:25.394
You know what he would do to me?

15:25.395 --> 15:26.445
He would...

15:26.446 --> 15:28.346
I know what he did
to David Taylor.

15:28.347 --> 15:30.282
What do you think,
you're gonna get

15:30.283 --> 15:31.950
a free pass from him?
No.

15:31.951 --> 15:34.236
Please, please.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.355
Listen, I watched him kill
David.

15:36.356 --> 15:39.124
I'm gonna testify against
Salazar in a court of law.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.226
I'm gonna put his ass away
for the rest of his life

15:41.227 --> 15:42.894
so you won't have to look over
your shoulder

15:42.895 --> 15:43.895
for the rest of yours.

15:43.896 --> 15:46.582
Okay.

15:46.583 --> 15:49.701
You gotta tell us
where we could find him.

15:52.221 --> 15:56.275
Lupino is his lieutenant.

15:56.276 --> 15:57.776
He called the shop today

15:57.777 --> 15:59.544
to make an appointment
for Salazar.

15:59.545 --> 16:03.348
He's scheduled to come in
tomorrow at 10:00.

16:06.736 --> 16:08.437
Okay.

16:08.438 --> 16:10.889
<i>You guys finish your homework</i>
<i>first,</i>

16:10.890 --> 16:13.025
then come down.

16:13.026 --> 16:14.109
What's for dessert, babe?

16:14.110 --> 16:16.328
You know what I noticed
about you tonight?

16:16.329 --> 16:18.797
What, that I look
incredibly handsome?

16:18.798 --> 16:22.417
You change the subject
every time

16:22.418 --> 16:24.703
I bring up Raymundo Salazar.

16:24.704 --> 16:26.672
Who?
Very funny. You can joke

16:26.673 --> 16:29.341
all you want, but no one has
ever testified against him.

16:29.342 --> 16:31.410
And if they try,
he has them killed

16:31.411 --> 16:33.912
before they get a chance.
Look, honey, you gotta stop

16:33.913 --> 16:36.682
believing everything you read
in the newspapers, okay?

16:36.683 --> 16:38.684
And he's on the FBI's
Most Wanted list.

16:38.685 --> 16:40.886
And guess who's on my most
wanted list right now?

16:41.387 --> 16:42.771
What?
Forget it.

16:42.772 --> 16:44.189
You can't be serious!

16:44.190 --> 16:46.608
Look, all right,
I'm sorry, okay?

16:46.609 --> 16:48.226
I just don't want you
to worry about me.

16:48.227 --> 16:49.961
I got enough people worried
about me already.

16:49.962 --> 16:52.097
Look, I'm testifying
against him.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.566
I watched this guy kill
an innocent kid in cold blood.

16:54.567 --> 16:55.934
I'm gonna testify.

16:55.935 --> 16:57.703
You know, this is not some...

16:57.704 --> 17:00.205
corner drug dealer we're talking about.
Well,

17:00.206 --> 17:02.641
since we're on the subject,
you know if we grab him up,

17:02.642 --> 17:05.127
I'm probably gonna have to send
you and the boys over to Dad's

17:05.127 --> 17:07.378
for a couple days,
just for safety.

17:07.380 --> 17:08.329
Are you serious?

17:08.330 --> 17:10.165
What do you want me
to do?

17:10.165 --> 17:11.750
It's a precaution.
When?

17:11.751 --> 17:15.319
Tomorrow, so you should probably
start packing tonight.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.089
I don't like this.

17:17.089 --> 17:18.490
I don't like it either!

17:18.491 --> 17:21.326
Look, what do you want me to do?

17:21.327 --> 17:24.311
Just think of it as like
a nice midweek vacation

17:24.313 --> 17:25.664
for you and the boys, okay?

17:25.665 --> 17:26.897
You'll have fun.
Okay.

17:26.898 --> 17:28.734
All right.
I'm gonna have a blast.

17:28.735 --> 17:30.435
Mm-hmm.
What am I gonna do with you?

17:30.436 --> 17:32.471
Mmm, I can think
of a lot of things

17:32.472 --> 17:34.139
you can do with me right now.

17:36.475 --> 17:39.661
Don't worry.

17:39.662 --> 17:41.413
It's gonna be all right.

17:53.676 --> 17:55.594
Hey. Police. Let's go.

17:55.595 --> 17:57.863
Put your hands up
against the wall.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.800
Let's go.

18:08.691 --> 18:12.644
Raymundo Salazar,
change of plans, buddy.

18:12.645 --> 18:14.112
What are you
talking about?

18:14.113 --> 18:16.181
You're under arrest
for the murder of David Taylor.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.349
Good thing you missed me.

18:18.350 --> 18:20.786
Nice haircut, by
the way. Let's go.

18:28.372 --> 18:31.223
Hey, babe. No, everything's
going according to plan.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.544
There's two detectives
at the boys' school.

18:32.635 --> 18:34.085
Right after dismissal,
they'll pick 'em up

18:34.086 --> 18:36.453
and bring 'em over
to the place I told ya.

18:36.481 --> 18:38.199
We're gonna proceed with your
pickup the same way

18:38.200 --> 18:39.584
we did in the '06 case,
all right?

18:39.585 --> 18:40.985
I got it.
You got nothing to worry about.

18:42.715 --> 18:44.950
Hey, I love you.

18:44.981 --> 18:47.083
I love you, too.
I'll check in later.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.651
Yeah.

18:48.652 --> 18:50.736
You almost done
with this mutt's pedigree?

18:50.737 --> 18:51.954
Yeah.

18:51.955 --> 18:53.756
It's a shame to waste your time
and you paper.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.890
I not gonna be here long.

18:54.891 --> 18:56.792
Mmm, ice in his veins, this one.

18:56.793 --> 18:58.561
Yeah, and you know what
for brains.

18:58.562 --> 19:00.329
You're going down
for A1 felony, bub.

19:01.331 --> 19:02.965
Take him downtown, Jack.
Yep.

19:02.966 --> 19:04.399
We'll see.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.734
We'll see?

19:05.735 --> 19:08.070
You know, you might be able
to intimidate

19:08.071 --> 19:10.873
the rest of your witnesses,
but you won't intimidate me.

19:13.510 --> 19:15.010
Well, well, well.

19:15.011 --> 19:16.712
Looks like
you made a friend.

19:16.713 --> 19:17.713
I try. What's up?

19:17.714 --> 19:19.414
I wanted you to know
I'm convening

19:19.415 --> 19:21.584
the grand jury on Friday
to get an indictment.

19:21.585 --> 19:22.918
I need you
to be there.

19:22.919 --> 19:23.953
Two days?
I'm impressed.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.187
It'll be the first time

19:25.188 --> 19:26.889
we've been able to
make charges stick.

19:26.890 --> 19:29.024
Yeah, well, maybe you're
a little bit worried

19:29.025 --> 19:31.694
that Salazar may try to
have me killed. Coffee?

19:31.695 --> 19:35.815
Salazar-- I don't put anything
past that animal.

19:35.816 --> 19:39.235
Well, that animal has never
run into a Reagan before.

19:43.039 --> 19:44.807
Good afternoon.
Thanks for coming.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.009
The New York City Police
Department is announcing

19:47.010 --> 19:48.711
the capture and arrest

19:48.712 --> 19:52.348
of alleged drug kingpin
Raymundo Salazar.

19:52.349 --> 19:55.751
He was taken into custody
without incident this morning

19:55.752 --> 19:59.588
by NYPD detectives
and is being held

19:59.589 --> 20:02.591
pending indictment for the
murder of David Taylor.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.393
Questions? John.

20:04.394 --> 20:06.328
Commissioner, rumors are that
the arresting officer was

20:06.329 --> 20:07.997
your son Daniel Reagan;
that he was

20:07.998 --> 20:11.317
involved in a gun battle
with the suspect, and is

20:11.318 --> 20:12.668
your eyewitness.
Will you confirm?

20:12.669 --> 20:14.403
No.

20:14.404 --> 20:16.355
The El Mal crew has a history
of witness intimidation.

20:16.356 --> 20:17.523
Does that concern you?

20:17.524 --> 20:18.808
No.

20:18.809 --> 20:20.509
When can we expect
an indictment?

20:20.510 --> 20:22.745
I'll take that.

20:22.746 --> 20:25.331
Special Narcotics prosecutor
Lyle Greene.

20:25.332 --> 20:27.049
First of all, I want to thank

20:27.050 --> 20:28.350
the New York City
Police Department

20:28.351 --> 20:31.203
for their excellent work
in apprehending Mr. Salazar.

20:31.204 --> 20:34.823
As to the indictment, we expect
that after Detective Reagan

20:34.824 --> 20:37.393
testifies before the grand jury
Friday afternoon,

20:37.394 --> 20:40.346
they will vote to indict
swiftly and surely.

20:40.347 --> 20:42.798
That's all for today. Thank you.

20:48.305 --> 20:51.223
Your grandstanding
for a sound bite

20:51.224 --> 20:53.342
just confirmed
our witness's name.

20:53.343 --> 20:54.693
I apologize.

20:54.694 --> 20:58.113
I can understand you're
sensitive-- it's your son.

20:58.114 --> 21:01.417
I'm always sensitive when
my people are put in harm's way.

21:01.418 --> 21:05.187
The guy from <i>Dia Noticias</i>
all but announced it.

21:05.188 --> 21:07.022
And where did that come from?

21:07.023 --> 21:08.657
It didn't come from my people.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.192
You got a leak.

21:30.347 --> 21:31.397
Ready to go?

21:31.398 --> 21:33.933
Yeah, one sec.

21:35.385 --> 21:37.152
Here, let me help you.

21:37.153 --> 21:38.320
Thanks.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.826
What precinct do you guys
normally work out of?

21:43.827 --> 21:44.860
Midtown usually.

21:44.861 --> 21:47.729
Oh, yeah?
North or South?

21:47.730 --> 21:48.697
North.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.232
Up on 67th, right?

21:50.233 --> 21:51.584
Yeah, that's it.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.209
You know what?

22:00.210 --> 22:02.577
I think I forgot
my wallet.

22:29.656 --> 22:31.874
Oh, thank you.

22:33.710 --> 22:36.178
Oh. M.E. just released
the autopsy.

22:36.179 --> 22:39.281
Uh... a 9mm slug
was sent to ballistics.

22:39.282 --> 22:42.084
Well, my eye-wit or not, I'd
sure like to have that gun.

22:42.085 --> 22:43.519
Mm-hmm.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.487
All right. Just brung up
Salazar's right-hand man

22:45.488 --> 22:46.889
Jorge Lupino.

22:46.890 --> 22:49.692
He was arrested in 2009
for Assault One. Huh.

22:49.693 --> 22:51.427
Guess what the result was?

22:51.428 --> 22:52.728
Witness recanted.

22:52.729 --> 22:54.663
Surprise, surprise.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.133
Reagan.

22:58.134 --> 22:59.518
What do you mean?

23:01.304 --> 23:03.072
Nah. No, I'll call her.

23:03.073 --> 23:05.641
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll call you back.

23:05.642 --> 23:07.826
Everything good?
Yeah, should be.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.395
Hello, Detective.

23:26.396 --> 23:27.496
Who's this?

23:27.497 --> 23:28.964
This is your worst nightmare.

23:28.965 --> 23:30.299
Come on. Put Lin on the phone.

23:30.300 --> 23:31.850
She's not available right now,

23:31.851 --> 23:34.853
and won't be until you decide
not to testify

23:34.854 --> 23:37.139
against Salazar
in the grand jury hearing.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.607
Who is this?

23:38.608 --> 23:40.376
Let me speak
to my wife right now.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.543
She's kind of pretty.

23:41.544 --> 23:43.178
Keep her that way.

23:43.179 --> 23:45.814
And, amigo,
don't try to find her,

23:45.815 --> 23:47.249
or we'll know about it.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.985
If you hurt one hair on her
head, I promise you...

23:49.986 --> 23:51.620
Hello?

23:51.621 --> 23:53.789
Hello?

24:24.712 --> 24:28.499
Nothing like a grilled cheese
sandwich on a chilly night.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.851
What did you tell the kids
when you picked them up?

24:30.852 --> 24:33.086
I...

24:33.087 --> 24:35.789
Hey. Where's Sean and Jack?

24:35.790 --> 24:37.357
In doing homework.

24:37.358 --> 24:38.525
Don't worry.
They don't know anything?

24:38.526 --> 24:39.927
Daddy!
Daddy!

24:39.928 --> 24:41.728
Hey. Hey.

24:41.729 --> 24:42.963
Daddy!
Hey.

24:42.964 --> 24:44.648
Hey.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.099
Hey, guys.

24:46.100 --> 24:49.653
Daddy, great-grandpa picked us
up with two men in a cop car!

24:49.654 --> 24:50.837
Yeah?

24:50.838 --> 24:52.689
That's great.

24:52.690 --> 24:54.808
Well, I used to have
your grandpa's job, remember.

24:54.809 --> 24:55.909
I just thought

24:55.910 --> 24:57.444
it would be fun for them.

24:57.445 --> 24:59.413
Where's Mom?

24:59.414 --> 25:02.482
Um, Mom's going to stay
at a spa tonight, boys.

25:02.483 --> 25:04.117
It's an early birthday gift.
Oh.

25:04.118 --> 25:05.519
That way
it can be boys' night out.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.820
Just you guys, okay?

25:06.821 --> 25:08.689
Well, when is she coming back?

25:08.690 --> 25:10.924
Jack, I have a feeling

25:10.925 --> 25:12.859
you know
where I hide the video games.

25:12.860 --> 25:14.294
I do, Grandpa.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.396
Well, I'm feeling
generous tonight.

25:16.397 --> 25:18.048
You got exactly one hour.

25:18.049 --> 25:19.550
Let's go! Come on!
Let's go!

25:19.551 --> 25:22.135
Come on, Sean!
Run!

25:25.974 --> 25:27.541
What's wrong?

25:27.542 --> 25:30.210
They got Linda, Dad.

25:50.498 --> 25:51.999
LINDA
Hi. This is Linda.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.667
Please leave your name
and number

25:53.668 --> 25:55.802
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can. Thanks.

25:57.005 --> 25:58.939
This is Detective Daniel Reagan.

25:58.940 --> 26:02.542
I want proof of life.

26:02.543 --> 26:04.210
You're going to call me back

26:04.211 --> 26:06.246
and put my wife Linda
on the phone

26:06.247 --> 26:07.781
and let me speak to her,

26:07.782 --> 26:11.285
or I promise you,
your boss is going down.

26:11.286 --> 26:13.553
And then I'm gonna come
and I'm gonna find you.

26:13.554 --> 26:16.590
And I'm gonna rip your friggin'
heart right out of your chest,

26:16.591 --> 26:19.860
do you understand me?

26:22.780 --> 26:24.731
Hey, Dad. What's going on?

26:24.732 --> 26:28.335
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.805
Erin's going to join us.

26:31.806 --> 26:33.974
Oh.

26:33.975 --> 26:35.409
Want something to eat?

26:35.410 --> 26:36.743
No. I'm good.
I got to get back.

26:36.744 --> 26:38.078
Here she is.

26:45.553 --> 26:47.554
Something's happened?

26:51.192 --> 26:53.960
They have Linda.

27:00.068 --> 27:01.234
What about the boys?

27:01.235 --> 27:02.653
They're safe.

27:02.654 --> 27:04.304
They're with Pop.

27:07.842 --> 27:09.276
What are we going to do?

27:09.277 --> 27:11.645
Well,

27:11.646 --> 27:13.847
it is, um...

27:13.848 --> 27:17.384
my considered opinion

27:17.385 --> 27:20.020
that if this gets out,

27:20.021 --> 27:22.422
if the media gets ahold of it,

27:22.423 --> 27:26.126
she won't have much
of a chance.

27:37.939 --> 27:39.439
<i>I don't understand.</i>

27:39.440 --> 27:42.075
Is there something
I'm not getting?

27:42.076 --> 27:45.846
I'm failing to understand
why we're even here.

27:45.847 --> 27:47.748
I need to have a conversation
with the guy, that's all.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.851
About what? I mean,
what didn't we cover

27:50.852 --> 27:52.552
when we were speaking
to him yesterday?

27:52.553 --> 27:54.654
I need to talk to him alone.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.958
Why do you need
to talk to him at all?

27:58.826 --> 28:00.660
I'll be a minute.

28:06.901 --> 28:08.168
Where is she?

28:08.169 --> 28:10.370
Who?

28:10.371 --> 28:12.506
My wife.

28:13.841 --> 28:16.676
You want to play dumb, huh?

28:17.545 --> 28:20.147
Well, I came
to make you a promise.

28:20.148 --> 28:21.882
I will get
on that stand tomorrow

28:21.883 --> 28:23.316
and I will testify,

28:23.317 --> 28:25.051
and you will spend the rest
of your life in prison.

28:25.052 --> 28:26.486
When I'm done with you,

28:26.487 --> 28:28.855
I'm going to round up
the rest of the El Mal crew,

28:28.856 --> 28:29.890
and I'm gonna spread the word

28:29.891 --> 28:31.458
that Raymundo Salazar
cooperated,

28:31.459 --> 28:33.059
and I think you know
what's going to happen

28:33.060 --> 28:34.961
to you after that.

28:34.962 --> 28:38.765
You're playing a very
dangerous game, Detective.

28:39.834 --> 28:42.335
I'm not playing.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.737
You want to tell me
what's going on?

29:00.738 --> 29:02.155
You bring me here,

29:02.156 --> 29:03.690
and then you leave me
standing outside.

29:03.691 --> 29:05.425
You look like hell.

29:05.426 --> 29:07.327
I don't even know
what we're doing here.

29:07.328 --> 29:10.063
And now you're going to testify
against this guy tomorrow.

29:10.064 --> 29:12.232
What is happening?

29:12.233 --> 29:14.267
Yeah.

29:14.268 --> 29:16.002
Talk to me.

29:16.003 --> 29:18.605
I'll tell you outside.

29:46.067 --> 29:47.767
♪ ♪

29:52.940 --> 29:55.075
Sir, here's the material
you requested.

29:55.076 --> 29:57.294
Did TARU isolate
the phone dumps

29:57.295 --> 29:58.578
from the throwaway phones?

29:58.579 --> 29:59.846
Yes, sir.

29:59.847 --> 30:02.949
And this is all calls,
incoming and outgoing,

30:02.950 --> 30:04.134
from the phone we confiscated

30:04.135 --> 30:05.852
from Salazar at his arrest.

30:05.853 --> 30:07.654
This is cross-referenced data

30:07.655 --> 30:08.989
from all known associates.

30:08.990 --> 30:10.290
And this is all pertinent data

30:10.291 --> 30:13.593
from all personnel involved
in the Salazar case.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.512
Thank you.

30:15.513 --> 30:16.596
Rest of the schedule,

30:16.597 --> 30:17.647
Councilman Singer at 16:00.

30:17.648 --> 30:18.665
Chiefs' briefing

30:18.666 --> 30:20.466
at 16:45, and DCPI at...

30:20.467 --> 30:23.370
Danny's wife's been taken.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.808
I'll clear the schedule, sir.

30:37.668 --> 30:39.652
Hi. Anything?

30:39.653 --> 30:42.005
I spoke to three El Mals,
all doing major time.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.206
They gave me a few addresses,

30:43.207 --> 30:44.657
but none of them panned out.

30:44.658 --> 30:47.360
Although, one of them did
confirm our suspicion.

30:47.361 --> 30:48.929
Salazar's definitely
getting information

30:48.930 --> 30:49.863
from somebody in the inside.

30:49.864 --> 30:51.231
He doesn't know
who it is, though.

30:51.232 --> 30:53.166
This guy thinks it might be
a cop. He doesn't know.

30:53.167 --> 30:55.068
Oh, I hate to think that.

30:55.069 --> 30:56.069
You got anything?

30:56.070 --> 30:57.170
Well, uh...

30:57.171 --> 30:58.772
working on the cell report.

30:58.773 --> 31:01.541
Your first call to Linda
pinged off a tower

31:01.542 --> 31:03.243
near the Third Avenue Bridge.
Okay.

31:03.244 --> 31:05.312
The second call, the
FDR tower in Harlem.

31:05.313 --> 31:07.247
Trouble is, we lost the ping.

31:07.248 --> 31:10.317
Knowing Linda, it's probably
her cell phone battery died.

31:10.318 --> 31:11.618
We're narrowing it down, Reagan.

31:11.619 --> 31:12.819
I know.

31:12.820 --> 31:15.255
Hey, what are you
guys working on?

31:15.256 --> 31:16.723
You never seem to go home.

31:16.724 --> 31:18.091
You checking up on us?

31:18.092 --> 31:20.560
Easy, I'm just
making conversation.

31:20.561 --> 31:21.928
Make it somewhere else.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.500
I know this is
a stupid question,

31:27.501 --> 31:29.169
but are you okay?

31:30.004 --> 31:32.539
Yeah. No.

31:33.407 --> 31:35.475
We're going to
figure it out, okay?

31:35.476 --> 31:36.710
I know.

31:41.882 --> 31:42.983
Yeah, Dad.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.384
They found the Hummer

31:44.385 --> 31:46.519
under the 59th Street Bridge.

31:47.554 --> 31:50.957
And, Danny,
there's a body in the car.

31:51.926 --> 31:53.760
An unidentified female.

31:53.761 --> 31:55.161
I'm on my way.

31:55.162 --> 31:57.447
They found a body, a female,
under the 59th Street Bridge.

31:57.448 --> 31:59.916
Okay, okay. I'll drive.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.568
Car's ready, sir.

32:16.968 --> 32:18.084
Danny.

32:18.085 --> 32:20.770
It's not her!
It's not Linda.

32:20.771 --> 32:21.754
Dad, are you sure?

32:21.755 --> 32:22.755
I'm sure.

32:22.756 --> 32:23.690
You okay?

32:23.691 --> 32:26.092
Yeah.
All right.

32:27.594 --> 32:28.728
Preliminary indicates

32:28.729 --> 32:30.263
Sylvia Montoya.

32:34.535 --> 32:36.236
Okay.

32:36.237 --> 32:38.104
Salazar's girlfriend.

32:38.105 --> 32:39.605
Yeah.

32:39.606 --> 32:41.041
She's the one
that led us to him.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.275
I'm thinking it
wasn't enough for him

32:42.276 --> 32:45.345
to kill her lover.
He had to see her dead, too.

32:45.346 --> 32:47.313
Oh, God.

32:55.581 --> 32:57.366
All these cell phone records.

32:57.403 --> 32:59.687
People waste half
their life on the phone.

32:59.688 --> 33:02.390
We need to ask TARU
to make a subset

33:02.391 --> 33:05.293
of where all these
throwaway phones are sold.

33:05.294 --> 33:07.361
Hello.
In here.

33:07.362 --> 33:09.080
How's Danny?

33:09.081 --> 33:12.767
I sent him back to the station
to try to get some sleep.

33:12.768 --> 33:15.837
As if any of us can.

33:15.838 --> 33:17.739
There's a mountain
of stuff here.

33:17.740 --> 33:20.759
They got to have someone
on the inside.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.878
Erin had a good idea,
but it went right over my head.

33:23.879 --> 33:26.815
Something about where
these phones were purchased.

33:34.907 --> 33:36.941
Hey. Thought you went home.

33:36.942 --> 33:39.360
Thought <i>you</i> went home.

33:39.361 --> 33:41.629
You need to eat.

33:41.630 --> 33:42.831
Yeah.

33:42.832 --> 33:44.365
Chinese food, huh?

33:44.366 --> 33:45.900
Yeah.

33:54.176 --> 33:57.045
Good morning, Commissioner.

33:57.046 --> 33:58.713
Hey.

33:58.714 --> 34:00.348
What's up?

34:00.349 --> 34:02.767
Well, you know how much
I like working on cars?

34:02.768 --> 34:04.052
How's mine,
by the way?

34:04.053 --> 34:05.453
Perfect.

34:05.454 --> 34:07.555
Anyway, I got the Five's
from last night,

34:07.556 --> 34:10.775
and there was all this stuff in
there about the Hummer, right?

34:10.775 --> 34:12.293
Car was completely tricked out.

34:12.293 --> 34:14.228
Bulletproof armor,

34:14.230 --> 34:15.964
hidden drop boxes
and hydraulic trapdoors.

34:15.965 --> 34:17.732
Very high-end stuff.

34:17.733 --> 34:19.784
Where would somebody go
to get that kind of work done?

34:19.784 --> 34:22.603
Most of the small body shops,
they just...

34:22.605 --> 34:24.906
Here's your coffee.
Thanks, Mary.

34:24.907 --> 34:27.708
They just build these traps in
the natural cavities of a car,

34:27.710 --> 34:29.811
but this kind of work
can cost 50 grand.

34:29.812 --> 34:32.947
Out of all five boroughs,
it came back down to one shop.

34:32.947 --> 34:35.283
They trick out vehicles
for celebrities, rappers,

34:35.284 --> 34:37.185
and my guess would be
high-end drug dealers.

34:37.186 --> 34:38.453
Does Danny know?

34:38.454 --> 34:40.088
Yeah, he does now.

34:40.089 --> 34:42.956
That's detective-level
police work, Officer Reagan.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.659
Thought you were
working a tour today.

34:45.661 --> 34:48.263
I called in sick, Commissioner.

34:49.364 --> 34:50.998
<i>I don't know who</i>

34:51.000 --> 34:52.634
customized that car.
It wasn't me.

34:52.635 --> 34:54.835
Oh, it was you.
The Hummer was tricked out here,

34:54.837 --> 34:56.187
and you're the guy
who tricked it out.

34:56.188 --> 34:57.839
now tell me where you
dropped off the Hummer.

34:58.941 --> 35:02.110
Look, I'd give up an
address if I were you.

35:02.111 --> 35:04.712
I got work to do.

35:05.848 --> 35:07.248
Well, I got work to do.

35:07.249 --> 35:09.000
What are you doing, man?
You could blind me for life.

35:09.001 --> 35:10.285
You're gonna tell me
where you dropped the Hummer,

35:10.286 --> 35:11.419
or I'm gonna torch you and

35:11.420 --> 35:12.954
this whole damn place.
What, are you, crazy?

35:12.955 --> 35:14.222
Yes, he is.

35:14.223 --> 35:15.990
Tell me!

35:15.991 --> 35:17.208
I didn't drop it off anyplace.

35:17.209 --> 35:18.626
This is El Mal!
They don't give you an address

35:18.627 --> 35:20.461
and a phone number!
Not good enough!

35:20.462 --> 35:22.597
Tell me where
you dropped off the Hummer.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.515
Look, okay, okay,
stop, man, stop! Look.

35:24.516 --> 35:26.834
Look, I delivered
a trapped-out Benz

35:26.835 --> 35:28.703
for those people
up in Harlem.

35:28.704 --> 35:29.938
Some grungy squat.

35:29.939 --> 35:31.806
36 West 128th.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.527
Come on.
I find out you're lying,

35:36.528 --> 35:39.147
I'm coming back
to finish the job.

35:44.153 --> 35:46.054
We got a good address in Harlem.

35:46.055 --> 35:48.873
I'll have ESU
and a bus standing by.

35:48.874 --> 35:51.242
If it looks good,

35:51.243 --> 35:53.695
execute the raid.

35:53.696 --> 35:57.699
Three, two, one. Go.

36:06.892 --> 36:08.559
Where's my wife?

36:08.560 --> 36:10.044
Look, she's not here, man.

36:10.045 --> 36:11.946
I said, where is she?

36:11.947 --> 36:13.848
Against the wall.
Go ahead.

36:15.150 --> 36:17.652
2064 Fifth Avenue, all right?

36:17.653 --> 36:19.904
I got an address, Jack.
Somebody cuff him.

36:19.905 --> 36:21.322
Come on.

37:11.623 --> 37:13.107
Linda?!

37:14.043 --> 37:15.309
Linda?!

37:16.912 --> 37:20.214
I got him. I got him.

37:20.215 --> 37:22.250
Come on!

37:24.353 --> 37:26.187
Second floor clear.

37:26.188 --> 37:28.356
Is anyone else in here?

37:28.357 --> 37:30.141
Okay. Okay.

37:30.142 --> 37:32.093
Okay.

37:32.094 --> 37:33.361
Okay, baby.

37:33.362 --> 37:34.645
Oh, Danny.

37:34.646 --> 37:35.697
It's all right.

37:35.698 --> 37:38.149
Okay.
Oh.

37:40.602 --> 37:41.969
On your stomach.
Turn over.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.604
Turn over!
Hands behind your back!

37:45.107 --> 37:46.657
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

37:46.658 --> 37:48.242
You promise?
Yeah.

37:48.243 --> 37:49.977
Did they hurt you?
No.

37:50.696 --> 37:53.114
I knew you
would find me.

37:54.450 --> 37:56.501
I know you would.

38:17.206 --> 38:18.773
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced
our panel.

38:18.774 --> 38:21.909
It seems our witness
is a no-show.

38:21.910 --> 38:24.746
Mr. Salazar,
in light of the fact

38:24.747 --> 38:27.281
the State can't produce a weapon
or any physical evidence

38:27.282 --> 38:28.983
linking you to the murder,
we have no choice

38:28.984 --> 38:30.251
but to release...

38:30.252 --> 38:33.404
Sorry. My apologies
for being late.

38:33.405 --> 38:37.375
Detective Reagan, witness
to the murder of David Taylor.

38:50.889 --> 38:52.873
You wanted to see me,
Commissioner?

38:52.874 --> 38:54.041
Thanks for coming.

38:54.042 --> 38:55.343
You know my daughter Erin.

38:55.344 --> 38:56.511
Hi, Lyle.

38:56.512 --> 38:57.678
Please, sit down.

38:57.679 --> 38:59.847
Erin and I were going
out to dinner

38:59.848 --> 39:01.048
to celebrate.

39:01.049 --> 39:03.718
Great thing for the NYPD
and the DA's office,

39:03.719 --> 39:04.886
this indictment.

39:04.887 --> 39:06.654
Yeah, there will
be many indictments

39:06.655 --> 39:07.989
out of this
investigation.

39:07.990 --> 39:09.857
You know,

39:09.858 --> 39:13.728
sometimes, Lyle, I am just
so proud of my daughter.

39:13.729 --> 39:16.464
But I'm getting ahead
of myself. Erin?

39:16.465 --> 39:22.336
See, there were phone calls made
with your throwaway phones.

39:22.337 --> 39:24.739
What throwaway phones?

39:24.740 --> 39:26.440
The ones that you bought
at Bleecker Street Electronics

39:26.441 --> 39:27.608
right around the corner

39:27.609 --> 39:28.609
from your apartment.

39:28.610 --> 39:29.944
You were smart
and paid cash,

39:29.945 --> 39:31.579
but the owner ID'd you.

39:31.580 --> 39:32.847
He must be mistaken.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.882
Well, see, we found the
store because we noticed

39:34.883 --> 39:37.318
most of the phone calls to
and from Salazar and his crew

39:37.319 --> 39:40.521
were from throwaway phones
sold at one location.

39:40.522 --> 39:42.356
Then we noticed the
proximity to you.

39:42.357 --> 39:44.559
And then, we concentrated
on you, Lyle.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.694
You were the mole.

39:46.695 --> 39:48.963
Oh, we'll get an
indictment, Lyle.

39:48.964 --> 39:50.698
And then, when we go to trial,

39:50.699 --> 39:54.468
we'll produce a key witness
against you-- Raymundo Salazar.

39:54.469 --> 39:57.271
Yeah, because once he finds out
you can't help him anymore,

39:57.272 --> 39:59.440
he's going to trade you in
like a used car.

39:59.441 --> 40:02.176
I'm leaving.

40:02.961 --> 40:05.546
Lyle Greene,
you're under arrest

40:05.547 --> 40:07.515
for bribe receiving
and official misconduct.

40:07.516 --> 40:09.684
Would you like
to do the honors, sweetheart?

40:09.685 --> 40:11.252
Sure.

40:11.253 --> 40:13.387
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:13.388 --> 40:15.656
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

40:15.657 --> 40:16.891
in the court of law.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.160
You have the right to
speak to an attorney,

40:19.161 --> 40:22.430
and to have that attorney
present during questioning.

40:22.431 --> 40:24.799
If you cannot afford a lawyer,
one will be appointed to you.

40:31.874 --> 40:34.242
I make a mean coleslaw,

40:34.243 --> 40:37.245
but I can't touch
this concoction by Tilden's.

40:37.246 --> 40:40.831
I can't identify
the mystery ingredient.

40:40.832 --> 40:42.416
Probably sugar.

40:42.417 --> 40:43.618
Yeah?
Yeah.

40:43.619 --> 40:44.985
Where's Mom and Dad?

40:44.986 --> 40:47.922
Well, I guess they're late.

40:49.191 --> 40:50.424
I miss Mom.

40:50.425 --> 40:52.627
You've been a real trooper,
Sean.

40:52.628 --> 40:54.295
You, too, Jack.

40:54.296 --> 40:55.796
Hey, we're here.

40:56.765 --> 40:57.965
Hey.
Mommy.

40:57.966 --> 41:00.501
Hey, Mom.

41:02.004 --> 41:03.437
There they are.

41:03.438 --> 41:05.039
Welcome back.

41:06.275 --> 41:07.408
Hey, Aunt Linda.

41:07.409 --> 41:08.743
I missed you, Mommy.

41:08.744 --> 41:10.044
How was your
time at the spa?

41:10.045 --> 41:11.812
My time at the spa was...

41:11.813 --> 41:13.848
fabulous.

41:13.849 --> 41:15.149
Those mud baths

41:15.150 --> 41:16.317
are awesome.

41:16.318 --> 41:19.370
I'm really glad
to see you, Mom.

41:19.371 --> 41:20.521
You said it, kid.

41:20.522 --> 41:21.589
Hey, guys,

41:21.590 --> 41:22.890
we've only got a small window

41:22.891 --> 41:23.991
for this fish and chips.

41:23.992 --> 41:26.244
Otherwise, it's
gonna be cold batter

41:26.245 --> 41:28.162
and soggy fries.
I'm okay.

41:28.163 --> 41:30.364
Mommy, Grandpa let us
stay up until midnight

41:30.365 --> 41:31.632
and play video games.

41:31.633 --> 41:33.217
What?

41:33.218 --> 41:34.568
Hey, what did I tell you guys?

41:34.569 --> 41:36.637
Whatever happens with Grandpa

41:36.638 --> 41:38.872
has to stay with Grandpa.

41:40.108 --> 41:42.093
I would, uh, like

41:42.094 --> 41:43.227
to say something.

41:43.228 --> 41:45.212
Uh, I don't want
to get corny,

41:45.213 --> 41:47.448
but I would just
like to say that, uh,

41:47.449 --> 41:51.519
I feel very lucky
to have you all here.

41:51.520 --> 41:55.690
And I know your mother,
your grandmother,

41:55.691 --> 41:57.792
would feel the same way.

41:57.793 --> 42:00.494
I know people
don't make time

42:00.495 --> 42:03.030
for this kind of thing nowadays,
but, uh...

42:03.031 --> 42:04.865
I'm glad we do.

42:04.866 --> 42:07.768
Family's what makes us strong.

42:13.375 --> 42:15.109
And, Linda...

42:16.845 --> 42:20.114
I'm glad you had a nice time
at the spa.

42:20.115 --> 42:23.484
Why, thank you.

42:23.485 --> 42:26.787
And I thought you might like
to say grace.

42:31.560 --> 42:34.528
Bless us, O Lord,

42:34.529 --> 42:36.630
for these gifts

42:36.631 --> 42:39.834
which we are about
to receive...
