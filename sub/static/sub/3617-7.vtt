- What about great dates?

Oh, no. Great dates never
end on the front porch.

00:12.999 --> 00:16.567

question: was this a good date
or a great date?

- Yes. Miles is not her type.

I don't remember.

38:15.584 --> 38:18.942
I don't know, Phoebe.
I don't know here.

38:19.042 --> 38:20.542
Piper, come on.

38:21.459 --> 38:23.692
Right, go right.

38:23.792 --> 38:25.584
Oh, God, forgive me.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.250
PHOEBE: We're going
the wrong way, it's behind us.

[GUNSHOTS]

38:47.584 --> 38:49.983
OFFICER 1:
S.F.P.D. Drop your weapon!

38:50.083 --> 38:52.167
OFFICER 2:
On the ground, now!

38:54.584 --> 38:56.417
OFFICER 3:
Put your hands behind your back!

40:10.334 --> 40:12.459
PIPER:
Phoebe, can we...?

40:13.417 --> 40:14.417
[WHISTLES]

40:18.167 --> 40:21.275
Oh, okay.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.025
How long have you guys
been standing there?

40:23.125 --> 40:26.192
Long enough to know you've got
some serious '80s dance moves.

40:26.292 --> 40:28.999
I guess you don't
need comfort food.

40:31.999 --> 40:34.150
- What you doing?
- A little laundry.

40:34.250 --> 40:35.359
Mm-hm.

40:35.459 --> 40:37.734
- Yeah, you don't do laundry.
- Yeah.

40:37.834 --> 40:39.999
- Are you okay?
- No.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.918
- PHOEBE: Are those
chocolate chip?
- Mm-hm.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.275
[SIGHS]

40:46.375 --> 40:48.692
I'm never gonna be okay
losing an innocent.

40:48.792 --> 40:50.859
You know, and I just--

40:50.959 --> 40:53.692
I'm having a really hard time
accepting the fact

40:53.792 --> 40:56.651
that I wasn't supposed
to save him.

40:56.751 --> 41:00.209
Wasn't Miles a little bit more
than just an innocent to you?

41:02.501 --> 41:05.109
I think I wanted him to be.

41:05.209 --> 41:07.359
For all the reasons Piper said.

41:07.459 --> 41:11.150
But I just have to concentrate
on me right now.

41:11.250 --> 41:14.667
You know, and not be afraid
that I may never find love
again.

41:16.792 --> 41:20.667
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.
You will definitely find love
again.

41:22.501 --> 41:25.899
- You think?
- Actually, I know.

41:25.999 --> 41:29.899
And I, for one, can guarantee
you that when it does happen for
you,

41:29.999 --> 41:32.567
I will not be
holding you back at all.

41:32.667 --> 41:35.567
Thanks, I think.

41:35.667 --> 41:38.667
Piper, is there something
you know that we don't know?

41:40.459 --> 41:43.459
Well, let's just say I had
a little premonition of my own.

41:44.999 --> 41:47.584
- Hey.
- Piper, hey.
