WEBVTT

00:00.591 --> 00:03.392
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.393 --> 00:04.727
Good job, everybody.

00:04.728 --> 00:06.762
Fresh off their
first dinner service victory.

00:06.763 --> 00:08.731
We actually finished
dinner service.

00:08.732 --> 00:10.232
Let's go.

00:10.233 --> 00:11.734
The men tried
to repeat their success.

00:11.735 --> 00:12.701
We ain't stopping.

00:12.702 --> 00:14.103
In the lamb challenge...

00:14.104 --> 00:15.571
Rack of lamb's in the oven.

00:15.572 --> 00:17.406
The women
questioned Robyn's timing...

00:17.407 --> 00:18.407
Don't you think
that's too early?

00:18.408 --> 00:19.942
This is a team event.

00:19.943 --> 00:21.510
You have to listen
to what your teammates say.

00:21.511 --> 00:23.012
...Which
came back to haunt them.

00:23.013 --> 00:23.746
<i>The lamb is raw.</i>

00:23.747 --> 00:25.381
<i>I'd like to eat that,</i>

00:25.382 --> 00:26.749
but I've still got
four children to look after.

00:26.750 --> 00:27.216
As the men...

00:27.217 --> 00:28.651
Blue team.
Yes!

00:28.652 --> 00:30.552
Claim their
first challenge win...

00:30.553 --> 00:31.987
I feel like I just gave birth.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.555
...Bring punishment...

00:33.556 --> 00:34.823
Now it's time to get cliquey.

00:34.824 --> 00:36.392
You just feel like giving me
an attitude today.

00:36.393 --> 00:38.027
I just feel like
giving you an attitude.

00:38.028 --> 00:39.428
...The red
team continue to splinter.

00:39.429 --> 00:40.896
Get on this side!

00:40.897 --> 00:43.232
No, I'm always quiet,
now I'm pissed off.

00:43.233 --> 00:45.067
If you with me,
you're gonna hear my mouth.

00:45.068 --> 00:46.335
This is when it gets ugly.

00:46.336 --> 00:47.870
And the bad will...

00:47.871 --> 00:49.204
Waiting on garnish,
waiting on garnish!

00:49.205 --> 00:50.339
Carried
into dinner service.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.974
Hurry up!

00:51.975 --> 00:54.410
You can't handle that
garnish, that's your ass, not mine.

00:54.411 --> 00:55.577
As the red team...

00:55.578 --> 00:56.779
Wellington up.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.447
<i>It's still stone-cold.</i>

00:58.448 --> 00:59.915
...Completely fell apart.

00:59.916 --> 01:01.483
Roshni is crashing
and burning right now.

01:01.484 --> 01:03.385
It's raw!
Get out!

01:03.386 --> 01:04.753
In the blue kitchen...

01:04.754 --> 01:06.255
Hurry up, please, guys.

01:06.256 --> 01:08.023
Brian quickly
lost chef Ramsay's confidence

01:08.024 --> 01:09.491
<i>on the fish station.</i>

01:09.492 --> 01:11.860
Brian! Come here!
Cat food. off, will you?

01:11.861 --> 01:13.829
I just can't
seem to cook fish.

01:13.830 --> 01:15.998
What's the matter
with that jerk?

01:15.999 --> 01:17.633
But Donald lost the
confidence of his whole team.

01:17.634 --> 01:19.268
Sirloin needs to cook.
Raw.

01:19.269 --> 01:21.236
Royce, shut up.
I am ready to go.

01:21.237 --> 01:23.605
Raw. Come on, Donald!

01:23.606 --> 01:26.842
As for chef Ramsay, he
lost his patience with both teams.

01:26.843 --> 01:28.944
It is like having a root canal

01:28.945 --> 01:31.080
<i>and passing a kidney stone
at the same time.</i>

01:31.081 --> 01:33.849
<i>The losing team...
Both teams.</i>

01:33.850 --> 01:36.018
I know about five monkeys that
could've done a better service.

01:36.019 --> 01:36.852
The blue team nominated...

01:36.853 --> 01:38.687
Don and Brian.

01:38.688 --> 01:40.122
The red team nominated...

01:40.123 --> 01:41.657
Roshni and Danielle.

01:41.658 --> 01:44.052
In the end,
chef Ramsay sent...

01:44.053 --> 01:45.495
Don.
Packing.

01:45.496 --> 01:46.028
<i>Give me your
jacket, big boy.</i>

01:46.029 --> 01:48.030
But he wasn't done yet.

01:48.031 --> 01:49.398
I'm not going on like this.

01:49.399 --> 01:50.866
Roshni, give me your jacket.

01:50.867 --> 01:52.368
You're in the blue team.

01:52.369 --> 01:54.069
Giving Roshni a new team,

01:54.070 --> 01:56.772
and another chance
to become head chef

01:56.773 --> 02:01.643
at Gordon Ramsay's Steak
at the Paris in Las Vegas.

<i>And now, the continuation

03:02.906 --> 03:04.573
I'm in disbelief right now,

03:04.574 --> 03:08.510
just how close I was
to being eliminated.

03:08.511 --> 03:11.213
I promise you it will not
happen again.

03:11.214 --> 03:12.548
We got faith in you, man.

03:12.549 --> 03:14.483
I joke around a lot,

03:14.484 --> 03:15.984
but now things are gonna
be a little different.

03:15.985 --> 03:17.386
It's no joke now.

03:17.387 --> 03:19.188
Yo, we don't have
an ashtray over here.

03:19.189 --> 03:20.656
<i>Rosh, bring me
an ashtray, please.</i>

03:20.657 --> 03:22.091
Please.

03:22.092 --> 03:23.392
I'm blue now, man.

03:23.393 --> 03:24.860
Aw, come on.

03:24.861 --> 03:27.029
It was not my decision
to go on the blue team.

03:27.030 --> 03:29.498
But whatever color it is,
red, white, blue, purple...

03:29.499 --> 03:31.133
I'm gonna give 'em 110%.

03:31.134 --> 03:32.167
Welcome to team blue.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.469
We're all fighters.

03:33.470 --> 03:35.437
I'm a fighter.

03:35.438 --> 03:37.339
While the men welcome
their newest member to the blue team,

03:37.340 --> 03:40.909
the women...

03:40.910 --> 03:42.010
Who?

03:42.011 --> 03:43.112
...Are a team divided.

03:46.116 --> 03:49.017
The red team have a
big rift in it right now.

03:49.018 --> 03:52.471
And, uh, we all
hate each other.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.730
It's gonna start getting dirty.

04:05.502 --> 04:07.936
After a
rough dinner service

04:07.937 --> 04:09.304
and a small shake-up
on the blue team...

04:09.305 --> 04:10.973
Roshni, come on.

04:10.974 --> 04:13.308
...The chefs are
more focused than ever,

04:13.309 --> 04:14.843
and that's good,
because chef Ramsay...

04:14.844 --> 04:16.211
Let's go.

04:16.212 --> 04:18.313
...ls not letting up.

04:18.314 --> 04:20.214
Big, big, big day today.

04:20.216 --> 04:24.286
There's one cuisine that I have
come to love in a big way.

04:24.287 --> 04:28.190
It's something that
we've never focused on

04:28.191 --> 04:30.225
<i>here in Hell's Kitchen
ever before.</i>

04:30.226 --> 04:31.960
That cuisine is...

04:31.961 --> 04:33.028
Mexican.

04:33.029 --> 04:34.496
Yes!

04:34.497 --> 04:36.431
I'm fired up.

04:36.432 --> 04:39.001
I love Mexican food, I cook
Mexican food all the time,

04:39.002 --> 04:40.636
I eat Mexican food
all the time.

04:40.637 --> 04:43.438
This is my strength.
We're winning.

04:43.439 --> 04:46.842
Scott, get your
big ass in here. Let's go.

04:47.944 --> 04:51.413
<i>Yeah, dude, pinata.</i>

04:51.414 --> 04:52.414
That's a big donkey.

04:54.217 --> 04:56.251
<i>Now, that's a pinata.
Wow.</i>

04:56.252 --> 04:58.086
I definitely
want to take a whack

04:58.087 --> 05:00.455
at chef Scott's ass.

05:00.456 --> 05:02.591
So, for today's challenge,

05:02.592 --> 05:08.063
you'll be turning five Mexican
classics into fine dining food.

05:08.064 --> 05:09.631
In a moment, these balls

05:09.632 --> 05:11.567
<i>are going to be
scattered everywhere.</i>

05:11.568 --> 05:12.467
Each of them has
a different ingredient on them.

05:12.468 --> 05:14.603
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

05:14.604 --> 05:16.972
Each team has 90 seconds

05:16.973 --> 05:21.910
<i>to grab a maximum of 25 balls,</i>

05:21.911 --> 05:24.012
and you split those ingredients

05:24.013 --> 05:26.181
<i>to make five stunning dishes.</i>

05:26.182 --> 05:29.952
On your marks...

05:29.953 --> 05:32.521
Get set...

05:32.522 --> 05:35.324
Go!

05:35.325 --> 05:36.758
Oh, !

05:40.463 --> 05:42.598
I did not expect
40 gazillion balls to fall

05:42.599 --> 05:44.633
<i>from the ceiling and bounce
all over the place.</i>

05:44.634 --> 05:47.002
<i>Balls are
literally everywhere.</i>

05:47.003 --> 05:48.704
20 seconds to go!

05:48.705 --> 05:50.405
Right here, I've got...

05:50.406 --> 05:51.440
yeah, I got carnitas.

05:51.441 --> 05:53.308
What about crema?

05:53.309 --> 05:56.211
I got swordfish, I got mushroom,
pineapple seed...

05:56.212 --> 05:58.146
I knew there was
a few specific balls

05:58.147 --> 06:00.349
that I needed
to get my hands on.

06:00.350 --> 06:02.718
So I got down on my knees,
and I just grabbed, uh...

06:02.719 --> 06:05.187
I grabbed whatever balls
were in front of me.

06:05.188 --> 06:07.289
<i>Garbanzo beans.
Three...</i>

06:07.290 --> 06:08.423
<i>Cucumber!
Two...</i>

06:08.424 --> 06:09.891
<i>Tomatillos. Tomatillos.
One...</i>

06:09.892 --> 06:10.959
And stop!

06:10.960 --> 06:12.194
It was a lot of balls.

06:12.195 --> 06:14.229
<i>Line up. Okay.</i>

06:14.230 --> 06:18.734
You have 35 minutes
to make five stunning dishes.

06:18.735 --> 06:19.735
Everybody ready?

06:19.736 --> 06:20.802
Yes, chef.

06:20.803 --> 06:23.405
Your time starts...

06:23.406 --> 06:25.474
Now. Yeah, let's go.

06:25.475 --> 06:27.909
Using the ingredients
written on the balls they selected,

06:27.910 --> 06:29.611
each team must create
fine-dining versions

06:29.612 --> 06:32.147
of five traditional
Mexican dishes.

06:32.148 --> 06:33.215
I call burrito.

06:33.216 --> 06:34.683
I'm taking enchilada.

06:34.684 --> 06:35.784
I'll make the soup.

06:35.785 --> 06:37.152
I'm gonna do tacos.

06:37.153 --> 06:38.320
Tacos, anybody else
want to do tacos?

06:38.321 --> 06:39.021
<i>I'll do tacos.</i>

06:39.022 --> 06:40.022
I'll do a tostada.

06:40.023 --> 06:41.590
<i>Everybody ready?</i>

06:41.591 --> 06:43.759
All seven
chefs will cook a dish.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.794
But each team
must choose which five

06:45.795 --> 06:47.796
they will present
to chef Ramsay for judging.

06:47.797 --> 06:49.464
What kind of tacos
are you doing, Brian?

06:49.465 --> 06:51.166
Shrimp with two sauces.

06:51.167 --> 06:54.736
I know how to put together
a beautiful Mexican plate.

06:54.737 --> 06:55.904
My dish is sexy.

06:55.905 --> 06:59.107
It's simple, it's beautiful,

06:59.108 --> 07:02.044
and it melts,
and it's pure ecstasy.

07:02.045 --> 07:04.813
That's what I'm all about.

07:04.814 --> 07:05.914
I'm about simplicity and sex.

07:07.817 --> 07:10.018
While Brian's in
love with what he's cooking...

07:10.019 --> 07:11.553
That was hot.
I didn't know that.

07:11.554 --> 07:12.988
Over in the red kitchen...

07:15.958 --> 07:18.260
Danielle isn't warming up
to her burrito.

07:18.261 --> 07:20.762
I'm really worried
about Danielle right now.

07:20.763 --> 07:23.565
I don't care if she had never
worked with Mexican before.

07:23.566 --> 07:25.767
It's really
not that hard.

07:25.768 --> 07:28.003
Needs something.
I don't know what.

07:28.004 --> 07:30.105
It's my first time
cooking Mexican ever.

07:30.106 --> 07:32.474
I'm nervous.

07:32.475 --> 07:34.509
I'm gonna give it 125%.

07:34.510 --> 07:36.845
15 seconds to go.
Yes, chef.

07:36.846 --> 07:38.246
Is everybody plating?

07:38.247 --> 07:40.148
<i>Yes.</i>

07:40.149 --> 07:43.352
Now start deciding
which one you're serving

07:43.353 --> 07:44.986
and which one you're dropping.

07:44.987 --> 07:46.254
In the red kitchen...

07:46.255 --> 07:47.622
Yeah, that's good.
This looks great.

07:47.623 --> 07:48.957
The women quickly decide

07:48.958 --> 07:51.059
which dishes
to present to chef Ramsay.

07:51.060 --> 07:53.161
All right, we're ready
to rock and roll over here.

07:53.162 --> 07:54.896
But over
in the blue kitchen...

07:54.897 --> 07:56.598
Which dish are you dropping?

07:56.599 --> 07:58.400
They're struggling to choose

07:58.401 --> 07:59.701
between Royce
and Brian's tacos.

08:02.405 --> 08:05.006
And they've decided to give
Patrick the final vote.

08:05.007 --> 08:06.341
<i>10 seconds left!</i>

08:06.342 --> 08:07.075
Which one tasted better?

08:07.076 --> 08:08.210
Hurry up.

08:08.211 --> 08:09.311
Guys, I'm going with Royce's.

08:09.312 --> 08:10.412
That's it.

08:10.413 --> 08:11.980
You gotta be
kidding me, man.

08:11.981 --> 08:14.916
It's a bad call.

08:14.917 --> 08:17.352
Okay, for this challenge,
I brought in

08:17.353 --> 08:21.089
two fantastic, amazing judges.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.658
First, we have the owner
and the executive chef

08:23.659 --> 08:25.160
of the stunning restaurant
Ortega 120.

08:25.161 --> 08:26.161
Wow.

08:26.162 --> 08:27.396
Thomas Ortega.

08:27.397 --> 08:30.265
<i>Thomas.
Good to see you, sir.</i>

08:30.266 --> 08:31.400
Likewise.

08:31.401 --> 08:32.801
<i>How are you?
Good. Very good.</i>

08:32.802 --> 08:33.568
Thank you so much for coming.

08:33.568 --> 08:35.003
Thanks for having me.

08:35.004 --> 08:38.340
Our next judge is the executive
chef at Rivera and Playa

08:38.341 --> 08:39.573
<i>here in L.A.</i>

08:39.575 --> 08:41.109
John Sedlar.

08:46.749 --> 08:48.450
John, thank you so much
for joining us.

08:48.451 --> 08:50.318
Thank you very much.
Good to see you.

08:50.319 --> 08:51.853
It feels really
good to put your dish

08:51.854 --> 08:53.255
in front of these
big-time chefs.

08:53.256 --> 08:55.090
You want 'em
to taste your food.

08:55.091 --> 08:56.491
When they say it's good,
you know it's good.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.260
Okay, let's start off.
Tacos. Let's go.

08:58.261 --> 09:01.029
First up in the
Mexican fine-dining challenge,

09:01.030 --> 09:03.265
Royce and Kimmie
will go head to head.

09:03.266 --> 09:04.933
Let's start off
with, um, Royce.

09:04.934 --> 09:07.936
I, uh, thought
traditional pork tacos.

09:07.937 --> 09:10.071
<i>I also have
smoked pimenton potatoes.</i>

09:10.072 --> 09:12.007
<i>One thing that
doesn't attract me</i>

09:12.008 --> 09:13.575
is the greasiness
of the tortilla.

09:13.576 --> 09:17.012
I agree with Thomas.

09:17.013 --> 09:18.113
Kimmie.

09:18.114 --> 09:20.348
Um, I made
a shrimp fajita taco.

09:20.349 --> 09:21.750
Why did you choose

09:21.751 --> 09:23.919
a flour tortilla
over a corn tortilla?

09:23.920 --> 09:26.721
<i>I'm from Memphis, so we eat
a lot of flour stuff.</i>

09:26.722 --> 09:28.924
The abundance of vegetables,
and the variety

09:28.925 --> 09:31.159
that you put on these tacos...
they look very appetizing.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.661
The flavors are very strong.

09:32.662 --> 09:34.095
Dammit.

09:34.096 --> 09:37.499
I'm gonna have to go with
the red team on this one.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.633
Red team. John?

09:38.634 --> 09:39.634
I agree. Red team.

09:41.838 --> 09:46.341
My tacos were
beautiful, vibrant, fresh.

09:46.342 --> 09:48.443
As certain as this is
my right hand,

09:48.444 --> 09:50.879
Kimmie would not
have beaten me.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.113
Uh, next up,
the burritos, please.

09:52.114 --> 09:53.515
<i>Let's go.</i>

09:53.516 --> 09:56.117
<i>Let's go, Clemenza.</i>

09:56.118 --> 09:59.721
Danielle, please explain
the dish to our guests.

09:59.722 --> 10:01.490
I went with the New York strip.
I grilled that.

10:01.491 --> 10:04.659
It's kind of falling apart.

10:04.660 --> 10:08.563
Did you roll it tightly?

10:12.168 --> 10:15.070
It's a little hard to eat.

10:15.071 --> 10:16.872
Clemenza,
please present the dish.

10:16.873 --> 10:19.841
We have kind of
a Mexican-Italian burrito.

10:19.842 --> 10:21.576
I got the two cheeses,
provolone and mozzarella,

10:21.577 --> 10:24.012
with a, uh, pork and chicken,

10:24.013 --> 10:26.114
and I just kind of tried to make
everything work together.

10:26.115 --> 10:27.215
I've always found
that Mexican food

10:27.216 --> 10:29.951
and Italian food are compadres.

10:29.952 --> 10:32.320
That's a good idea.
Thank you.

10:32.321 --> 10:35.156
I like that you've...
that you thought out of the box.

10:35.157 --> 10:36.858
I'm gonna go
with the blue team on this one.

10:36.859 --> 10:38.627
John.
I agree. Blue team.

10:38.628 --> 10:39.794
<i>Excellent.
Good job, Clemenza.</i>

10:39.795 --> 10:41.162
Thank you, sir.

10:41.163 --> 10:43.431
It was a fantastic feeling.

10:43.432 --> 10:45.300
I wanted to pull down my pants

10:45.301 --> 10:46.601
and slide across the floor
in my underwear

10:46.602 --> 10:48.703
like risky business.
Yeah!

10:48.704 --> 10:49.971
Thank you.

10:49.972 --> 10:52.007
The soup, please.

10:52.008 --> 10:54.709
With the teams tied at
one, Tiffany's crab salsa soup...

10:54.710 --> 10:57.178
It tastes good because the
delicious flavor of the crab...

10:57.179 --> 11:00.248
...ls up against Justin's
pickled shrimp tortilla soup.

11:00.249 --> 11:01.850
I, actually, overall,
like the flavor of that.

11:01.851 --> 11:03.318
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

11:03.319 --> 11:05.120
And although
both dishes impress...

11:05.121 --> 11:07.222
I have to say that the red team
did it for me.

11:07.223 --> 11:08.523
I agree.

11:08.524 --> 11:09.724
Thank you.

11:09.725 --> 11:11.259
Tiffany gets the point,

11:11.260 --> 11:12.961
putting the women up by one.

11:12.962 --> 11:15.397
Okay, next up,
enchilada, please. Let's go.

11:15.398 --> 11:19.034
Christina's fine-dining
take on carnitas enchiladas...

11:19.035 --> 11:20.769
I feel that that dish
has been sanitized

11:20.770 --> 11:22.103
of anything Mexican.

11:22.104 --> 11:23.505
...Takes a hit.

11:23.506 --> 11:24.973
Lacking the authenticity.

11:24.974 --> 11:26.841
While Patrick's
lobster enchilada...

11:26.842 --> 11:28.810
Flavor is so good.

11:28.811 --> 11:30.445
And, uh, had
the spirit of Mexico.

11:30.446 --> 11:31.212
...Packs a punch.

11:31.213 --> 11:32.213
Red team or blue team?

11:32.214 --> 11:33.548
Uh, blue team.

11:33.549 --> 11:35.517
I'm gonna have to go
with the blue team.

11:35.518 --> 11:36.618
<i>Congratulations.
Good job, Patrick.</i>

11:36.619 --> 11:39.754
<i>Okay. Tied up, 2-2.</i>

11:39.755 --> 11:42.057
Last dish is the round
of the tostada. Let's go.

11:42.058 --> 11:43.124
Come on, Roshni-ro.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.426
Yeah, baby!

11:44.427 --> 11:45.927
We got a shot
to actually win this.

11:45.928 --> 11:47.529
I'm stoked, we're tied up.

11:47.530 --> 11:49.664
Roshni's up against
her former team.

11:49.665 --> 11:52.067
Wouldn't it be something if
Roshni were to pull off the win

11:52.068 --> 11:54.302
for the blue team?

11:54.303 --> 11:55.604
Come on, Rosh.

11:55.605 --> 11:57.372
Okay, um, Dana.

11:57.373 --> 12:00.008
I did a seared
ahi tuna tostada.

12:00.009 --> 12:01.610
Nice idea,
the watermelon and mango.

12:01.611 --> 12:02.811
Thank you, chef.

12:02.812 --> 12:04.245
I like the way the tuna

12:04.246 --> 12:06.181
went with a little bite
of the jicama

12:06.182 --> 12:07.482
<i>and the watermelon.</i>

12:07.483 --> 12:09.184
Come on, Dana.

12:09.185 --> 12:11.252
We can pull this point off,
and we can win this.

12:11.253 --> 12:12.320
Let's do this.

12:12.321 --> 12:14.756
Good job.
Thank you, chef.

12:14.757 --> 12:16.524
Roshni, please present
your dish.

12:16.525 --> 12:18.526
<i>I went with a grilled tostada.</i>

12:18.527 --> 12:20.128
<i>With a chili crab filling.</i>

12:20.129 --> 12:21.496
I brought my roots
into it a little bit.

12:21.497 --> 12:25.800
<i>I roasted off
coriander seed first.</i>

12:30.339 --> 12:32.007
Thomas, what'd you think?

12:32.008 --> 12:33.675
I love the flavor of
the coriander and the spice

12:33.676 --> 12:34.509
at the back end.
Very nice.

12:34.510 --> 12:35.910
Thank you, chef.

12:35.911 --> 12:37.278
I'm gonna have to go
with the blue team.

12:37.279 --> 12:38.813
<i>Blue team.</i>

12:38.814 --> 12:40.949
I really like
the vibrant flavor in my mouth.

12:40.950 --> 12:43.218
Um, the salsa is the best salsa
I've had here today.

12:43.219 --> 12:45.086
Thank you, chef.

12:45.087 --> 12:48.323
<i>But the red team created
the best overall fresh dish.</i>

12:48.324 --> 12:50.992
<i>Red team. Wow.</i>

12:50.993 --> 12:52.661
Two very well
thought-out dishes.

12:52.662 --> 12:54.396
Oh, .
Now we're at a draw.

12:54.397 --> 12:55.830
What happens now?

12:55.831 --> 12:57.432
Um, gents, we're faced
with a tough decision.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here

13:08.965 --> 13:12.468
<i>It's the final round
of Hell's Kitchen's first-ever</i>

13:12.469 --> 13:14.570
Mexican fine-dining
challenge...

13:14.571 --> 13:16.539
I'm gonna have to go
with the blue team.

13:16.540 --> 13:17.773
Uh, John, it's all down to you.

13:17.774 --> 13:19.341
The red team.

13:19.342 --> 13:21.444
...And the guest
judges have come to a draw.

13:21.445 --> 13:22.912
We're faced
with a tough decision.

13:22.913 --> 13:23.679
<i>Well done.
Thank you, chef.</i>

13:23.680 --> 13:25.481
Both back in line.

13:25.482 --> 13:27.783
Now it's up to
chef Ramsay to break the tie

13:27.784 --> 13:30.853
between Dana and her
former teammate Roshni.

13:30.854 --> 13:35.191
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

13:35.192 --> 13:37.393
I'm staring at chef Ramsay,

13:37.394 --> 13:40.229
trying to use the Jedi powers
of, "blue, blue, blue,

13:40.230 --> 13:43.799
blue, blue, blue, blue."

13:43.800 --> 13:48.771
<i>Blue, blue, blue,
blue, blue, blue...</i>

13:48.772 --> 13:52.541
Congratulations.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.143
Red team.

13:55.979 --> 13:58.280
I won for our team,

13:58.281 --> 14:00.316
and it feels
so, so, so, so good.

14:00.317 --> 14:03.285
That dish was the best
overall dish of the day.

14:03.286 --> 14:05.621
Thank you, chefs.

14:05.622 --> 14:11.026
What's up? Who's the best
on the red team? I am.

14:11.027 --> 14:12.128
Thomas, thank you so much.

14:12.129 --> 14:13.395
Thank you, Gordon.

14:13.396 --> 14:14.597
John, best wishes.
Thank you so much.

14:14.598 --> 14:16.565
Well done.
Brilliant.

14:16.566 --> 14:18.067
Ladies, as your reward,

14:18.068 --> 14:21.203
<i>you're all gonna
have an amazing day</i>

14:21.204 --> 14:22.304
inspired by Mexican culture.

14:22.305 --> 14:25.007
Yeah.
Whoo!

14:25.008 --> 14:26.742
You're gonna head off to John
Sedlar's restaurant, Rivera...

14:26.743 --> 14:28.144
Oh, my God.

14:28.145 --> 14:29.278
For a stunning, gourmet lunch.

14:29.279 --> 14:30.980
Yes!

14:30.981 --> 14:34.216
And there is a big
surprise waiting for you there.

14:36.052 --> 14:37.686
Go get changed,
because your limo is waiting.

14:37.687 --> 14:39.889
Off you go.
Good job.

14:39.890 --> 14:42.992
Good job, guys.
Aah!

14:42.993 --> 14:44.627
<i>Blue team,
you'll be having a day</i>

14:44.628 --> 14:47.830
of Mexican misery.

14:47.831 --> 14:49.365
It's Mexican night.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.600
<i>You'll be prepping
all the salsas by hand,</i>

14:51.601 --> 14:52.668
<i>all the tortillas.</i>

14:52.669 --> 14:53.869
Off you go.

14:53.870 --> 14:55.804
I was robbed of my chance

14:55.805 --> 14:59.942
to bounce back from my
performance last night.

14:59.943 --> 15:02.144
With my dish there,
we would've won.

15:02.145 --> 15:03.946
Brian wants redemption,

15:03.947 --> 15:05.681
so I'm sure he's
a little perturbed at me.

15:05.682 --> 15:07.183
You know, whatever.

15:07.184 --> 15:08.417
This is what happens
when you lose, Roshni.

15:08.418 --> 15:09.952
Welcome to losing.

15:09.953 --> 15:12.988
While Roshni officially
becomes a loser on the blue team,

15:12.989 --> 15:16.392
the red team gets ready
to enjoy their victory.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.060
Let's go get intoxicated!

15:18.061 --> 15:19.562
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

15:19.563 --> 15:21.497
Bye, guys.

15:21.498 --> 15:23.699
Bye!

15:23.700 --> 15:26.602
Hey.
Cheers.

15:26.603 --> 15:27.603
Whoo!

15:27.604 --> 15:29.271
Welcome to Rivera.

15:29.272 --> 15:30.906
Thank you.

15:30.907 --> 15:32.775
I am definitely excited
to be eating in style today.

15:32.776 --> 15:34.510
Oh, my gosh.

15:34.511 --> 15:39.215
<i>What you have is the
classic Yucatan puerco pibil.</i>

15:39.216 --> 15:41.383
This is so good.

15:41.384 --> 15:42.384
Perfect, right?

15:42.385 --> 15:43.719
I love Mexican food.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.022
Oh, the civet de porc
was so good.

15:47.023 --> 15:51.327
I love to experience food.
Honestly.

15:51.328 --> 15:52.928
It was the best meal
I've ever had in my entire life.

15:52.929 --> 15:54.096
It was that good.

15:54.097 --> 15:57.233
To the red team!

15:57.234 --> 16:00.035
So where is
the blue team right now?

16:00.036 --> 16:01.904
Here we go, guys.

16:01.905 --> 16:04.640
Tripe.

16:04.641 --> 16:08.010
Oh, I like tripe.

16:08.011 --> 16:10.179
My joke when I eat tripe
is I say it tastes like grass.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.914
This is gonna taste like ass.

16:11.915 --> 16:13.849
I'm about to throw up
before we even start eating.

16:13.850 --> 16:15.718
That's disgusting.
I don't like tripe.

16:15.719 --> 16:18.554
It's got an awful,
awful, awful smell.

16:18.555 --> 16:22.258
It's this musky,
nasty, dead, .

16:22.259 --> 16:23.892
Just keep that
away from me.

16:23.893 --> 16:24.960
I hate tripe.

16:26.029 --> 16:27.029
Ugh...

16:27.030 --> 16:28.764
Gonna barf on the table.

16:28.765 --> 16:30.766
I'm telling you, a little lemon,
I'd be golden.

16:33.903 --> 16:38.173
<i>Oh, my God.
Are you serious?</i>

16:38.174 --> 16:39.908
Hey, guys.
Why don't you come up?

16:39.909 --> 16:41.644
<i>Let's all learn some salsa.
Come on.</i>

16:41.645 --> 16:43.212
Oh, .

16:43.213 --> 16:44.880
Salsa dancing?

16:44.881 --> 16:47.783
I'm kinda scared.

16:47.784 --> 16:49.451
<i>One, two, three, to the side.</i>

16:49.452 --> 16:51.287
One...
Five...

16:51.288 --> 16:53.389
<i>I don't know how to dance.
I'm from the South.</i>

16:53.390 --> 16:54.957
We bounce in the South.

16:54.958 --> 16:57.192
We don't... we don't do
this little slow stuff.

16:57.193 --> 16:59.495
I mean, we get down
in the South.

16:59.496 --> 17:02.998
<i>One... to the back.
One, three, to the sides.</i>

17:02.999 --> 17:04.967
You like that?

17:04.968 --> 17:08.069
<i>One, two, three... yeah!
To the side.</i>

17:08.070 --> 17:10.071
While the red
team is cutting loose,

17:10.073 --> 17:13.876
the blue team
is just cutting...

17:13.877 --> 17:17.146
And cutting...

17:17.146 --> 17:20.049
And cutting.

17:20.050 --> 17:21.617
Patrick, you done
with this over here?

17:21.617 --> 17:23.319
<i>Listen to me, Patrick.</i>

17:23.319 --> 17:25.087
I keep talking to you
a lot of times,

17:25.088 --> 17:25.621
and you're just
still not answering me.

17:25.622 --> 17:26.722
<i>Patrick.</i>

17:26.723 --> 17:28.991
If you're gonna take
the lead, lead.

17:28.992 --> 17:30.793
I'm trying to figure
something out.

17:30.794 --> 17:32.461
Then you want to come over
and out,

17:32.462 --> 17:33.796
<i>and expect me
to listen.</i>

17:33.797 --> 17:35.230
<i>You can do
whatever you want.</i>

17:35.231 --> 17:36.065
Honestly, you can do
whatever the you want.

17:36.066 --> 17:37.633
That's like the tenth time!

17:37.634 --> 17:38.934
I've got everybody
asking me questions...

17:38.935 --> 17:39.735
<i>I'm trying to give direction.</i>

17:39.736 --> 17:41.470
Now you hear me.

17:41.471 --> 17:44.006
I'm not gonna lead
everybody to the promised land.

17:44.007 --> 17:46.575
If you need me to tell you
to go prep some ,

17:46.576 --> 17:48.210
you shouldn't even
be here.

17:55.118 --> 17:57.886
Hey, guys.

17:57.887 --> 17:58.921
How was it?

17:58.922 --> 18:00.255
Fabulous.

18:00.256 --> 18:02.224
Tequila was excellent.

18:02.225 --> 18:04.693
<i>Whoo!</i>

18:04.694 --> 18:08.063
Not winning is
like pulling your lips

18:08.064 --> 18:09.765
to the back of your head,

18:09.766 --> 18:13.268
while someone throws
dripping acid on your face.

18:13.269 --> 18:15.304
Whoo!

18:15.305 --> 18:16.405
It sucks.

18:16.406 --> 18:20.309
<i>* La cucaracha *</i>

18:20.310 --> 18:22.711
After a long punishment,

18:22.712 --> 18:24.947
the blue team finally
gets a chance to unwind.

18:24.948 --> 18:27.316
They don't even use flour
tortillas in mexico.

18:27.317 --> 18:29.551
But someone is still
bitter about the challenge.

18:29.552 --> 18:31.587
Some girl from Memphis is not
gonna make a better

18:31.588 --> 18:33.622
flavored taco than me.

18:33.623 --> 18:35.724
Especially when you're
going into a taco challenge

18:35.725 --> 18:37.359
<i>that's supposed to be
somewhat traditional,</i>

18:37.360 --> 18:39.962
you don't use flour tortillas.

18:39.963 --> 18:41.397
I don't want to listen
to anybody bitch.

18:41.398 --> 18:42.765
No bitching.

18:42.766 --> 18:44.566
I'm on a no-bitching
policy now.

18:44.567 --> 18:47.403
Despite her
no-bitching policy,

18:47.404 --> 18:49.238
<i>after drinking it over...</i>

18:49.239 --> 18:52.307
Everybody's like,
"What? Uhh...Ehh..."

18:52.308 --> 18:54.610
Tiffany makes it her duty

18:54.611 --> 18:56.578
to fill in Kimmie
and Robyn on the gossip.

18:56.579 --> 19:00.349
So what do our lovely ladies
have to say this evening, Tiff?

19:00.350 --> 19:01.550
Uh, .

19:01.551 --> 19:03.085
There was a lot
of said.

19:03.086 --> 19:06.522
Dana and, uh,

19:06.523 --> 19:09.658
Christina and Danielle

19:09.659 --> 19:12.828
said something like...

19:12.829 --> 19:14.797
The problem is...

19:14.798 --> 19:16.765
They don't even use flour
tortillas in mexico.

19:16.766 --> 19:19.368
...ln her current
state, she somehow decides

19:19.369 --> 19:21.336
what Royce said
was actually said

19:21.337 --> 19:23.138
by three members
of her own team.

19:23.139 --> 19:25.507
They just...
I mean, basically,

19:25.508 --> 19:27.943
it was like the whole, like,
"oh, she's from the South,

19:27.944 --> 19:30.145
<i>"so why is she using flour
tortillas?" Type of .</i>

19:30.146 --> 19:31.380
I got the point,
though, right?

19:31.381 --> 19:33.282
Exactly.

19:33.283 --> 19:34.950
Dana, Danielle, and Christina

19:34.951 --> 19:36.885
are all talking behind my back.

19:36.886 --> 19:38.554
I just... I don't understand where
all those girls' heads are at.

19:38.555 --> 19:40.355
I didn't see Christina
pull a point.

19:40.356 --> 19:42.424
<i>Didn't see Dani pull a point.</i>

19:46.129 --> 19:48.664
It's the start of a new day,

19:48.665 --> 19:51.066
and before the red team heads
down to the kitchen to prep...

19:51.067 --> 19:52.935
Please, could we just squash
whatever's going on out?

19:52.936 --> 19:54.970
I don't have a problem
with anybody.

19:54.971 --> 19:58.173
Robyn is
determined to clear the air.

19:58.174 --> 19:59.741
I heard that people were
talking about Kimmie's dish.

19:59.742 --> 20:01.176
About her dish?

20:01.177 --> 20:02.177
Something like that.

20:02.178 --> 20:03.612
No.
So...

20:03.613 --> 20:04.585
<i>Nobody talked
about her dish.</i>

20:04.586 --> 20:07.649
all right,
someone's lying, then.

20:07.650 --> 20:09.518
This is all "he
said, she said," .

20:09.519 --> 20:11.220
Let's get it out on
the open table and discuss it.

20:11.221 --> 20:13.655
I think all three of y'all
are pieces of

20:13.656 --> 20:17.459
For talking about me
about last night at the jacuzzi.

20:17.460 --> 20:19.061
Can you tell me
when you heard this?

20:19.062 --> 20:20.062
<i>Yeah, tell me what we said.</i>

20:20.063 --> 20:21.697
Okay, so you didn't say

20:21.698 --> 20:23.465
that I should've made corn
tortillas instead of flour.

20:23.466 --> 20:24.933
I said nothing about your dish.

20:24.934 --> 20:26.602
You heard somebody
say something,

20:26.603 --> 20:28.403
<i>and now you're coming at us.</i>

20:28.404 --> 20:29.571
I'm just telling you
what was said to me, man.

20:29.572 --> 20:31.173
You're making assumptions,

20:31.174 --> 20:32.674
<i>and you're mad at us,
and we don't know why.</i>

20:32.675 --> 20:33.909
<i>That's not really fair.</i>

20:33.910 --> 20:36.011
You are, because you weren't
there, and you didn't hear it.

20:36.012 --> 20:37.079
<i>You guys quit
interrupting me</i>

20:37.080 --> 20:37.913
and screaming over me...

20:37.914 --> 20:39.848
Dana, you can kiss
my ass.

20:39.849 --> 20:41.350
You're a bitch.

20:41.351 --> 20:43.352
Where I come from,
that's how I .

20:43.353 --> 20:45.087
You come up to ,
call me a piece of .

20:45.088 --> 20:46.989
Damn right I call people...
damn right.

20:46.990 --> 20:49.024
I don't give a
about her tacos.

20:49.025 --> 20:50.726
<i>You could tell me how ghetto
you are from Memphis,</i>

20:50.727 --> 20:53.428
like, do what you want,
come hit me if you want.

20:53.429 --> 20:56.098
I said nothing about your dish.

20:56.099 --> 20:57.499
<i>You're a bitch.</i>

21:02.636 --> 21:05.370
Tonight is the
first-ever Mexican night

21:05.371 --> 21:05.770
in Hell's Kitchen.

21:05.771 --> 21:06.838
But right now,

21:06.839 --> 21:08.139
a misunderstanding
on the red team

21:08.140 --> 21:09.674
caused by Tiffany...

21:09.675 --> 21:11.810
<i>I said nothing
about your dish.</i>

21:11.811 --> 21:14.646
...Has the women
at each other's throats.

21:14.647 --> 21:16.614
I don't need
to apologize for .

21:16.615 --> 21:18.450
I didn't do anything,
you came at me,

21:18.451 --> 21:20.218
and now we have a problem.

21:20.219 --> 21:21.753
If you ever...
get used to it.

21:21.754 --> 21:22.821
I'm not gonna get used to it.

21:22.822 --> 21:24.389
I'm just not gonna talk to you.

21:24.390 --> 21:25.523
<i>I'll talk to you in the kitchen
when I have to talk to you,</i>

21:25.524 --> 21:27.759
and that's it.
She's a child.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.494
I'm still pissed.
They're all lying bitches.

21:29.495 --> 21:30.995
I don't trust any of them.

21:30.996 --> 21:32.664
I just don't know if fighting

21:32.665 --> 21:36.134
right before service
was a good idea.

21:36.135 --> 21:38.002
You need me to move?

21:38.003 --> 21:42.073
While the women
have lost all common courtesy,

21:42.074 --> 21:43.074
in the blue kitchen...

21:43.075 --> 21:44.242
Thank you.

21:44.243 --> 21:46.311
Everyone is on
their best behavior.

21:46.312 --> 21:48.313
The fact that Roshni
is in the kitchen with us,

21:48.314 --> 21:50.048
we're holding back
on the cursing and the yelling.

21:50.049 --> 21:51.983
<i>.</i>

21:51.984 --> 21:53.785
<i>Don't use that word, man.
That ain't cool.</i>

21:53.786 --> 21:54.652
<i>Sorry.</i>

21:54.653 --> 21:55.653
You know,
there's a woman present.

21:55.654 --> 21:56.955
You don't want
to be disrespectful,

21:56.956 --> 21:58.289
so we're all better guys
with her on our team.

21:59.592 --> 22:00.592
Bless you.

22:00.593 --> 22:03.328
Thank you.

22:03.329 --> 22:05.263
Ladies, let's go.

22:05.264 --> 22:06.464
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

22:06.465 --> 22:09.934
Line up, please.
Let's go.

22:09.935 --> 22:12.337
Okay, tonight we're
making history.

22:12.338 --> 22:16.118
<i>Why? Because it's our
first ever Mexican night.</i>

22:16.119 --> 22:17.417
I am so excited.
Aren't you guys?

22:17.418 --> 22:17.976
Yes, chef!

22:17.977 --> 22:20.078
Thank you.
Go to your stations. Let's go.

22:20.079 --> 22:23.281
All right, James.

22:23.282 --> 22:25.550
What the
are you wearing?

22:25.551 --> 22:26.551
Chef.
Honestly.

22:28.654 --> 22:30.321
<i>I'd rather give a wave
than wear that.</i>

22:30.322 --> 22:32.123
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Yes, chef.

22:32.124 --> 22:37.128
<i>Si, senor!</i>

22:50.776 --> 22:54.145
For tonight's
fine-dining Mexican night,

22:54.146 --> 22:56.714
chef Ramsay has created
a special menu,

22:56.715 --> 23:00.018
featuring an ahi tuna tostada,
tequila cilantro mussels,

23:00.019 --> 23:02.253
and a New York strip
with mojo verde.

23:02.254 --> 23:03.254
Order in, chef.

23:03.255 --> 23:04.255
Ladies, let's go.

23:04.256 --> 23:05.356
Four couples, table 30.

23:05.357 --> 23:06.457
<i>Two tuna, two mussels.</i>

23:06.458 --> 23:08.126
Yes, chef.

23:08.127 --> 23:10.228
It's really important
to start off strong.

23:10.229 --> 23:12.297
The apps have to come
right out the gate

23:12.298 --> 23:13.631
and take the lead.

23:13.632 --> 23:14.799
I'm hoping Barbie
can pull it out.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.767
How long for the mussels?

23:15.768 --> 23:19.904
Walking with mussels, chef.

23:23.175 --> 23:24.242
me.

23:24.243 --> 23:27.078
One's full of flavor, here,

23:27.079 --> 23:29.113
<i>and one's totally
abandoned and abused.</i>

23:29.114 --> 23:30.181
Even the color's different.

23:30.182 --> 23:31.716
Bland, delicious.

23:31.717 --> 23:33.718
Unbelievable.
Yes, chef.

23:33.719 --> 23:35.620
<i>Can somebody
help Barbie, please?</i>

23:35.621 --> 23:38.056
You got it? I'll back off
if you got it.

23:38.057 --> 23:39.824
<i>It's right here.
I got it.</i>

23:39.825 --> 23:40.959
I had some trouble
starting off.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.961
But I'm gonna fight back.
I can do this.

23:42.962 --> 23:45.797
While the red team
starts over on their first ticket...

23:45.798 --> 23:47.498
Come on, we can't get behind.

23:47.499 --> 23:48.733
...Back in the blue kitchen...

23:48.734 --> 23:50.335
Let's go. Two tuna.

23:50.336 --> 23:53.705
Guy is ready to impress
with his first appetizers.

23:53.706 --> 23:55.206
Walking with tuna.

23:55.207 --> 23:56.240
Walking with the tuna.

23:56.241 --> 23:57.709
<i>I know my .</i>

23:57.710 --> 24:00.144
<i>I will not,
under any circumstances,</i>

24:00.145 --> 24:01.145
put out bad food.

24:01.146 --> 24:04.849
That's it.

24:04.850 --> 24:06.484
Oh, me. Guy!

24:06.485 --> 24:09.654
Come here. I've got one raw,
and one st... touch that.

24:09.655 --> 24:11.889
Stone cold.
It's good, it's good.

24:11.890 --> 24:15.793
You wanna argue?

24:15.794 --> 24:17.261
I want it at room temperature.

24:17.262 --> 24:19.697
Look at me.
Just do it.

24:19.698 --> 24:21.032
I don't want tuna
tasting of the fridge.

24:21.033 --> 24:22.266
Got it?

24:22.267 --> 24:24.836
Yes, chef!
Firing another two right now.

24:24.837 --> 24:26.904
The tuna... I mean, come on.

24:26.905 --> 24:28.373
You're pan-searing a piece
of tuna, guy. Get it right.

24:28.374 --> 24:30.408
Tuna!
Coming up, chef!

24:30.409 --> 24:31.843
Tuna!

24:31.844 --> 24:35.346
<i>Where's the tuna?</i>

24:38.851 --> 24:40.652
Finally.
Service, please.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.687
Thank you.

24:42.688 --> 24:44.789
Guy's tuna has garnered
chef Ramsay's stamp of approval...

24:44.790 --> 24:46.324
Walking with the wraps.

24:46.325 --> 24:48.226
Service, please.

24:48.227 --> 24:50.328
And appetizers are
quickly leaving the blue kitchen.

24:50.329 --> 24:51.596
<i>Is yours good?
Very good.</i>

24:51.597 --> 24:53.131
Now Barbie is ready...

24:53.132 --> 24:54.866
Walking with mussels, chef.

24:54.867 --> 24:57.201
to get her vote
of confidence from chef Ramsay

24:57.202 --> 25:02.206
with her second attempt
at the first appetizers.

25:04.710 --> 25:06.811
Service, please.

25:06.812 --> 25:08.746
A half-hour
into dinner service,

25:08.747 --> 25:10.581
Barbie has bounced back.

25:10.582 --> 25:12.116
And her mussels are making

25:12.117 --> 25:14.185
their way out
to the dining room.

25:14.186 --> 25:15.987
<i>They're perfect, I think.
Mm-hmm.</i>

25:15.988 --> 25:17.321
Coming right back
with the garnish.

25:17.322 --> 25:19.157
Service, please.

25:19.158 --> 25:21.325
With appetizers now
steadily leaving the kitchen...

25:21.326 --> 25:22.393
Two snapper,
two New York strip.

25:22.394 --> 25:23.795
Two chicken, two pork.

25:23.796 --> 25:25.463
<i>Danielle on meat...</i>

25:25.464 --> 25:27.365
We're coming, chef, in about
30 seconds, with the pork.

25:27.366 --> 25:31.335
And Dana and Kimmie are ready
to move on to entrees.

25:31.336 --> 25:33.071
Are you putting this
all on one thing?

25:33.072 --> 25:37.742
Yup.

25:37.743 --> 25:41.045
Oh, hey.

25:41.046 --> 25:43.014
Fish and meat on the same tray.

25:43.015 --> 25:47.719
Meat dripping into the fish,
fish dripping into the meat.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.520
I said to her, "where do you
want me to put this?

25:49.521 --> 25:51.055
"Do you want it
on this tray?"

25:51.056 --> 25:52.457
She's like, "yeah, sure,
put it on that tray."

25:52.458 --> 25:53.257
Who put that on there?

25:53.258 --> 25:55.293
That's disgusting.

25:55.294 --> 25:57.061
<i>Who done that?</i>

25:57.062 --> 25:59.163
<i>I'm waiting on
Dana to say she did it,</i>

25:59.164 --> 26:00.965
because that bitch did it.

26:00.966 --> 26:03.167
How could you put that
onto one tray?

26:03.168 --> 26:05.069
<i>I think Kimmie needs
to grow some balls.</i>

26:05.070 --> 26:06.871
It's your station.
Man up.

26:06.872 --> 26:08.372
Who put that on there?

26:08.373 --> 26:09.907
<i>Was it a ghost?</i>

26:09.908 --> 26:11.776
<i>Somebody tell me
what is happening!</i>

26:11.777 --> 26:13.177
idiots.

26:21.214 --> 26:24.983
An hour into Hell's
Kitchen's first-ever Mexican night...

26:24.984 --> 26:26.952
Hey, look.

26:26.953 --> 26:29.054
Chef Ramsay has made
a disappointing discovery.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.089
Fish and meat on the same tray.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.226
Meat dripping into the fish,
fish dripping into the meat.

26:34.227 --> 26:37.929
But no one on the red team
will admit to the crime.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.332
Who put that on there?

26:40.333 --> 26:42.534
Who put that on there?

26:42.535 --> 26:44.870
<i>Who?</i>

26:44.871 --> 26:45.871
I did, chef.

26:48.508 --> 26:50.575
Dana put
that on there.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.778
I said I did it to chef Ramsay
because it was my station.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.446
But it was her fault.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.281
I got it. Move.
I got it, I got it. Move. Okay.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.350
Get off my station.

26:58.351 --> 27:01.353
So now we're dragging
the New York strip.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.255
I was pissed
that I'm getting in trouble

27:03.256 --> 27:04.122
for something
somebody else did.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.392
Yeah. All right, just checking.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.328
Dana, did you
put that on there?

27:09.329 --> 27:10.329
No, I asked her specifically,
"do you want this... "

27:10.330 --> 27:11.930
no, you put it on there.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.665
Who the cares?

27:13.666 --> 27:15.000
Just finish the food,
and shut the up!

27:15.001 --> 27:15.867
I don't want to hear it!

27:15.868 --> 27:17.536
Stop.

27:17.537 --> 27:19.471
<i>Just stay over
there, and off my .</i>

27:19.472 --> 27:20.639
Nasty bitch, dude.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.674
Kimmie, like, for a
big girl, is a big baby.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.042
That's what she is.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.310
I don't need to
deal with that

27:25.311 --> 27:26.345
while trying to help you.

27:26.346 --> 27:27.546
That's .

27:27.547 --> 27:28.980
Dude, I was
totally stoked

27:28.981 --> 27:30.549
till that bitch...

27:30.550 --> 27:32.050
<i>All right,
we'll discuss it later.</i>

27:32.051 --> 27:32.551
Let's bounce back.

27:32.552 --> 27:34.219
Balls to the wall.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.121
While Kimmie
stews in the red kitchen,

27:36.122 --> 27:37.255
over in the blue kitchen...

27:37.256 --> 27:38.924
Entree. One chicken,
one pork, one New York strip.

27:38.925 --> 27:39.925
How long?

27:39.926 --> 27:41.927
1 1/2 minute, chef.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.262
Patrick and Guy are
ready with their first entrees.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.064
I'm going up fast
with the chicken.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.766
Chicken!
Do you have the New York strip?

27:47.767 --> 27:50.769
... up to the best.
Three strips.

27:55.575 --> 27:58.076
Unbelievable.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.745
Stop!

27:59.746 --> 28:01.046
One just slightly overcooked.

28:01.047 --> 28:05.317
And one that is dry.

28:05.318 --> 28:07.753
Come on, talk to me, Guy!

28:07.754 --> 28:09.488
Come on,
Guy, get it right.

28:09.489 --> 28:10.856
I know you can cook a steak.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.792
We've all done this
a million times before.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.160
It's not rocket science.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.028
<i>Patrick!
Yes, chef?</i>

28:17.029 --> 28:19.464
<i>He's given up, he's stopped.
He's off. He's switched off.</i>

28:19.465 --> 28:21.800
You need to control it.
You got to start showing up now.

28:21.801 --> 28:22.934
Yes, chef.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.436
I guess his expectation for me

28:24.437 --> 28:25.203
is a lot higher
than everybody else.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.805
And that's fine.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.174
I'm always willing
to step up and take the lead.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.542
All right, brother.
Hold it tight. You got it.

28:30.543 --> 28:31.810
No problem.

28:31.811 --> 28:34.079
While Patrick
gets Guy going on the grill,

28:34.080 --> 28:36.515
back in the red kitchen,
Danielle...

28:36.516 --> 28:38.116
Yo, my pork is, like,
the bomb, yo.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.419
Who said Dani can't grill?

28:40.420 --> 28:42.087
<i>...Is confident
that they're now ready</i>

28:42.088 --> 28:42.888
<i>with their first entrees.</i>

28:42.889 --> 28:43.722
Okay, I'm ready!

28:43.723 --> 28:45.457
Walking now, chef!

28:45.458 --> 28:47.592
I'm feeling
confident the pork is perfect.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.094
You know,
this is my time to shine.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.562
Chef, one pork.
Let's go.

28:50.563 --> 28:54.733
Come on, let's go.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.936
me.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.705
. All of you! Stop!
Yes, chef!

29:00.706 --> 29:02.007
Come here.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.910
The ultimate insult.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.645
Raw pork.

29:06.646 --> 29:08.280
<i>Not pink...</i>

29:08.281 --> 29:10.882
Not slightly undercooked...

29:10.883 --> 29:12.651
Raw!

29:12.652 --> 29:14.186
!

29:14.187 --> 29:17.022
He was pissed.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.825
I felt really bad for the pig.

29:19.826 --> 29:22.394
The pig didn't do it.
It was Danielle.

29:22.395 --> 29:24.162
I'm sorry, chef.
Oh, Danielle...

29:24.163 --> 29:26.031
<i>Got two more in the oven?</i>

29:26.032 --> 29:26.631
Two more in the oven,
and drop two more.

29:26.632 --> 29:27.732
Sear two more.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.268
<i>We gotta do that
whole check again!</i>

29:30.269 --> 29:31.970
While Danielle
starts over on her pork,

29:31.971 --> 29:33.071
in the blue kitchen...

29:33.072 --> 29:34.506
<i>I'm starting to cut.
You ready?</i>

29:34.507 --> 29:35.574
Yes, I am.

29:35.575 --> 29:37.509
Guy and Patrick are ready

29:37.510 --> 29:40.145
to have their entrees
blessed by chef Ramsay.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.446
Guys, I'm going to the pass.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.582
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:43.583 --> 29:46.318
, it's not...

29:46.319 --> 29:47.652
Well, almost ready.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.588
Two chicken, how long?

29:49.589 --> 29:51.690
I have a chicken in the oven,
it'll be one more minute, chef.

29:51.691 --> 29:52.991
I'm very sorry.
I'm working on it.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.459
Yeah, off with you.
Piss off!

29:54.460 --> 29:55.527
Sorry, chef.

29:55.528 --> 29:56.795
Have you sliced the strip?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.797
Yeah, I did.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.165
<i>You let him slice,</i>

30:00.166 --> 30:01.066
and your chicken's
one more minute.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.033
<i>Piss off!</i>

30:02.034 --> 30:03.335
What're you gonna do?

30:03.336 --> 30:05.170
You shouldn't have sliced it.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.105
Patrick, you told
me to cut the steak.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.807
You didn't give me
the right time.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.576
You told me it's ready,
and it wasn't ready.

30:11.577 --> 30:12.978
you, .

30:12.979 --> 30:13.979
Come here, you two.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.915
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

30:16.916 --> 30:20.218
Hey, piss off.

30:20.219 --> 30:24.222
I've never been thrown
out of anything in my life,

30:24.223 --> 30:27.259
so it's a bad place to be,
and it's a feeling.

30:29.695 --> 30:32.697
So whatever.

30:32.698 --> 30:37.002
I up a chicken,
I up the table.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.074
With Patrick and
guy banished to the dorms...

30:43.075 --> 30:44.676
Two pork, two chicken, guys!

30:44.677 --> 30:46.478
...The remaining members
of the blue team

30:46.479 --> 30:48.046
try to come together
on the entrees.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.715
We can do this, baby,
let's just pull this off.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.517
And in the red kitchen...

30:52.518 --> 30:53.518
Where's the pork?

30:53.519 --> 30:54.786
Right here!

30:54.787 --> 30:56.888
Danielle is looking
to redeem herself

30:56.889 --> 30:59.190
with her second attempt
at the pork.

30:59.191 --> 31:02.594
I think it's good. If it's not,
I'm gonna freak out.

31:02.595 --> 31:04.262
Oh, .
Danielle, he's cutting it.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.898
<i>So just get another one going.</i>

31:06.899 --> 31:09.434
It's coming back.
It's coming back. It's raw.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.037
Dani, get another pork
working now.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.972
Hey.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.240
<i>Stop!</i>

31:15.241 --> 31:16.875
<i>Raw pork again.</i>

31:16.876 --> 31:18.510
Pink and bloody in the middle.

31:18.511 --> 31:21.680
I give up.

31:21.681 --> 31:23.315
And one more thing, get out!

31:23.316 --> 31:25.717
Danielle sent out raw pork,

31:25.718 --> 31:29.287
and she didn't send it out once,
but twice, she sent up raw pork.

31:29.288 --> 31:30.689
Christina,

31:30.690 --> 31:33.391
<i>flash that pork on that
griddle pan, urgently.</i>

31:33.392 --> 31:35.026
Yes, chef.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.362
An hour and 15
minutes into dinner service,

31:37.363 --> 31:39.998
three chefs have been
kicked out of the kitchen.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.400
You hungry, there, baby?
I know.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.302
<i>No entrees have been served.</i>

31:44.303 --> 31:46.638
One chicken, one pork,
one New York strip. How long?

31:46.639 --> 31:50.208
<i>And chef Ramsay's patience
is understandably wearing thin.</i>

31:50.209 --> 31:52.611
<i>New York is walking.</i>

31:52.612 --> 31:54.112
I'm going up with pork,
two chicken, guys!

31:54.113 --> 31:55.280
Where's the other pork?

31:55.281 --> 31:56.448
One more pork. How long?

31:56.449 --> 31:57.882
None of them are cooked.

31:57.883 --> 31:59.985
<i>Two more minutes on the pork!</i>

31:59.986 --> 32:01.686
<i>Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?</i>

32:01.687 --> 32:02.153
This is ready right here!

32:02.154 --> 32:04.623
<i>.</i>

32:04.624 --> 32:06.591
Justin, don't put out
the pork.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.259
Don't put out the pork,
it's not cooked.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.494
It's ready right here.
Here.

32:09.495 --> 32:10.895
Sorry, chef.
I apologize.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.597
<i>Sure that was done?</i>

32:12.598 --> 32:14.065
Don't put out the pork,
it's not cooked,

32:14.066 --> 32:17.969
don't put out the pork,
it's not cooked.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.472
Don't put out the pork.
It's not cooked.

32:20.473 --> 32:22.107
Hey.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.742
Both of you, come here!

32:23.743 --> 32:24.743
I said it wasn't done.

32:24.744 --> 32:25.977
That is it.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.846
Get out!

32:27.847 --> 32:30.315
Yes, chef.
I said it wasn't done.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.416
Get out!

32:31.417 --> 32:33.018
I just told you

32:33.019 --> 32:34.352
the pork's not cooked
five times.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.887
It's my fault, Clemenza.

32:35.888 --> 32:38.156
How dumb can you be?

32:38.157 --> 32:40.892
The total number of chefs
in the dorms is now up to five.

32:40.893 --> 32:45.230
And in the red kitchen, Barbie
is taking special precautions

32:45.231 --> 32:47.365
to make sure
she doesn't join them.

32:47.366 --> 32:48.867
Hey, you, come here, you.

32:48.868 --> 32:50.068
Give me that.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.270
The day we need...
look at me.

32:52.271 --> 32:55.440
A thermometer.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.977
The day we need that
to cook a breast of chicken.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.212
You, get out!

33:01.213 --> 33:02.714
I don't know why
she can't cook chicken.

33:02.715 --> 33:04.349
I really don't.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.984
Cooking a breast of chicken

33:05.985 --> 33:08.119
is about as easy
as taking a .

33:08.120 --> 33:09.120
Anybody can do it.

33:09.121 --> 33:12.857
Are you that dumb?

33:15.194 --> 33:16.761
Tiffany.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.363
Yes, chef. Put that down.
Look at me.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.998
Seriously, I've had enough.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.133
burnt mash.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.468
Get out.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.036
Get out!

33:25.037 --> 33:26.738
I swear to God.

33:26.739 --> 33:28.673
I don't give a if the
whole team goes home tonight.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.408
I don't care.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.311
Chef Ramsay is on, like,
a kicking-out spree tonight.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.947
I'm kind of scared
right now, I'm not gonna lie.

33:35.948 --> 33:38.416
It's the four of us now.
Let's get this done. Let's go!

33:38.417 --> 33:40.452
90 minutes
into dinner service,

33:40.453 --> 33:42.287
and tonight
is on its way to being

33:42.288 --> 33:45.090
the worst dinner service
since opening night.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.558
God help one person

33:46.559 --> 33:48.393
that makes one more -up
on that table.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.261
<i>Where's the chicken?
It's up!</i>

33:50.262 --> 33:53.364
And chef Ramsay
is ready to snap.

33:55.968 --> 33:58.269
Hey, chef.
chef, come here.

33:58.270 --> 34:02.407
Burned bits of crispy skin.
Eat that.

34:02.408 --> 34:03.541
How did that taste?

34:03.542 --> 34:06.644
Terrible, chef.
Get out!

34:06.645 --> 34:08.913
<i>Hey. I'm done.</i>

34:08.914 --> 34:11.049
You're over your head.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.685
Get out of here.

34:13.686 --> 34:15.786
All of a sudden,
it's just me and Rosh.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.589
Holy .

34:17.590 --> 34:19.257
I don't give a
if I finish this table

34:19.257 --> 34:20.458
on my own with Scott.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.360
I don't care anymore.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.161
We are screwed, big-time.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.397
Both of you, come here!

34:32.943 --> 34:35.444
It's more than two
hours into Mexican night...

34:35.445 --> 34:37.045
Hey, piss off!

34:37.047 --> 34:41.617
and so far, chef Ramsay
has said adios to eight chefs.

34:41.618 --> 34:43.485
Get out of here.

34:43.487 --> 34:45.221
And the last two members
of the blue team

34:45.222 --> 34:46.554
may be about to join them.

34:46.556 --> 34:49.792
Both of you, come here!

34:49.793 --> 34:51.460
I swear to God,
on my children's life,

34:51.460 --> 34:53.496
you that table,
that's it.

34:53.496 --> 34:56.899
<i>Yes, chef.
It's history.</i>

34:56.900 --> 34:59.035
I look at Brian,
Brian looks at me,

34:59.036 --> 35:00.102
I said, "come on, Brian,
we'll push this out."

35:00.103 --> 35:01.270
How's it looking, Brian?

35:01.271 --> 35:02.638
Beautiful.

35:02.639 --> 35:03.973
<i>You ready?
I'm ready.</i>

35:03.974 --> 35:05.441
<i>Let's go.
Sauce is up.</i>

35:05.442 --> 35:09.178
Two chicken.

35:11.214 --> 35:12.548
Service, please.

35:12.549 --> 35:14.316
While Brian and Roshni...

35:14.317 --> 35:16.118
Walking with the garnish.

35:16.119 --> 35:18.354
Walking with the wrap.

35:18.355 --> 35:20.389
manage to rise from
the rubble in the blue kitchen,

35:20.390 --> 35:21.924
the remaining chefs
on the red team...

35:21.925 --> 35:23.793
Come on, ladies.
Let's do this.

35:23.794 --> 35:25.895
are also coming together
to get their food out.

35:25.896 --> 35:27.630
Chicken, walking to window.

35:27.631 --> 35:29.265
Walking to the window
on mushrooms.

35:29.266 --> 35:31.067
<i>Service, please.</i>

35:31.068 --> 35:32.301
And both teams
complete dinner service.

35:32.302 --> 35:33.502
Good job, Rosh.

35:33.503 --> 35:35.337
Brian, you too.

35:35.338 --> 35:37.406
Being one of the last two
people in the kitchen tonight...

35:37.407 --> 35:40.943
whoo, God!
That feels good.

35:40.944 --> 35:45.581
Tonight turned out to be
an absolute disgrace.

35:47.217 --> 35:50.186
Raw pork.

35:50.187 --> 35:52.588
<i>Kimmie.
Yes, chef.</i>

35:52.589 --> 35:54.690
Honestly, New York strip

35:54.691 --> 35:57.693
touching snapper
on the same tray?

35:57.694 --> 35:59.161
<i>Dana was the one that put</i>

35:59.162 --> 36:00.162
the steak on with the fish.

36:00.163 --> 36:01.597
Is that true, Dana?

36:01.598 --> 36:04.333
That is not
how I recall it happening.

36:04.334 --> 36:06.469
Are you putting this
all on one thing?

36:06.470 --> 36:08.337
Yup.

36:08.338 --> 36:10.372
I asked her if she was
using the same tray,

36:10.373 --> 36:13.142
<i>and the answer was yes,
so if I put it on there,</i>

36:13.143 --> 36:14.743
then I did under her direction,

36:14.744 --> 36:17.980
and that's what
I remember happening.

36:17.981 --> 36:19.248
Patrick,

36:19.249 --> 36:22.084
<i>as the oldest person
in this kitchen,</i>

36:22.085 --> 36:23.085
are you tired?

36:23.086 --> 36:25.187
No, chef, I'm not tired.

36:25.188 --> 36:27.756
I'm tired of you.

36:27.757 --> 36:29.992
I don't get it.

36:29.993 --> 36:31.861
Both teams lose.
Let's get that right.

36:31.862 --> 36:33.996
<i>You should be embarrassed.</i>

36:33.997 --> 36:35.965
Both teams, get upstairs.

36:35.966 --> 36:39.101
<i>And come up with two
individuals for elimination.</i>

36:39.102 --> 36:40.769
Yes, chef.

36:40.770 --> 36:44.607
off out of here.
Leave me alone, will you?

36:44.608 --> 36:46.275
This was not
a hard service.

36:46.276 --> 36:47.009
We should be mortified.

36:47.010 --> 36:48.477
All of us.

36:48.478 --> 36:51.013
Everybody on this team
needs to be held accountable.

36:51.014 --> 36:52.481
We have to obviously
pick somebody.

36:53.850 --> 36:55.684
The two stations
that really went down,

36:55.685 --> 36:57.753
<i>and then people
had to really help.</i>

36:57.754 --> 37:00.055
<i>And the initial people on them
should be what it is,</i>

37:00.056 --> 37:03.926
so I feel Patrick and Guy.

37:03.927 --> 37:05.394
Based on tonight,
I have to go with the same.

37:05.395 --> 37:08.164
<i>Patrick and Guy.</i>

37:08.165 --> 37:10.099
I think it's a strategic move
on their part to put me up now.

37:10.100 --> 37:11.767
I'm a man amongst boys,

37:11.768 --> 37:15.204
and they're vultures
waiting to feast on my carcass.

37:15.205 --> 37:18.474
And I'm gonna bring the biggest
fight they've ever seen.

37:18.475 --> 37:20.643
While Patrick
prepares for battle,

37:20.644 --> 37:23.879
on the red team,
the gloves are already off.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.282
You us on the tuna
with that mussels.

37:26.283 --> 37:27.283
Well, you know what?

37:27.284 --> 37:29.185
<i>I got kicked out</i>

37:29.186 --> 37:30.753
for sticking a thermometer
in a piece of chicken.

37:30.754 --> 37:32.454
No, you didn't, bitch!

37:32.455 --> 37:34.089
No, no "bitch" words!

37:34.090 --> 37:36.091
No, it's gonna go down!
You know how I talk!

37:36.092 --> 37:40.329
<i>Barbie is the weakest link
on the red team. Period.</i>

37:40.330 --> 37:42.264
If this was the hood,
this bitch would already be

37:42.265 --> 37:43.499
beat the down
right now.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.167
<i>I think Kimmie,
like, blew it.</i>

37:45.168 --> 37:46.835
And she didn't try
to make it right at all.

37:46.836 --> 37:47.803
I'm not putting myself up.

37:47.804 --> 37:49.338
<i>No. Hell no.</i>

37:49.339 --> 37:51.440
Because I don't feel like
I deserve to be up there.

37:51.441 --> 37:53.342
<i>Kimmie, she deserves
to be up there.</i>

37:53.343 --> 37:55.978
<i>I think Kimmie should go home.</i>

37:55.979 --> 37:57.980
<i>Listen,
this is how I feel.</i>

37:57.981 --> 38:00.916
Common sense, it's her.
Because she served raw pork.

38:00.917 --> 38:02.851
I know, but it's not like
I up all night.

38:02.852 --> 38:04.353
That was the first thing.

38:04.354 --> 38:05.821
I don't think
I up royally.

38:05.822 --> 38:07.723
I just sent out a raw pork.

38:07.724 --> 38:09.358
I just feel like Danielle

38:09.359 --> 38:10.559
<i>doesn't deserve
to go home tonight,</i>

38:10.560 --> 38:11.994
<i>based on her performance.</i>

38:11.995 --> 38:15.264
It's close between Dani,
Barbie, and Kimmie.

38:15.265 --> 38:17.199
I think I need to talk
to Christina right now,

38:17.200 --> 38:20.469
because Danielle
is my best friend here,

38:20.470 --> 38:22.338
and I don't want her
to go home.

38:22.339 --> 38:24.807
Kimmie, Robyn, and Tiffany
have a alliance.

38:24.808 --> 38:28.544
I feel like the three of us
need to stick together,

38:28.545 --> 38:30.579
because if we don't, they're
gonna pick us off one by one.

38:30.580 --> 38:32.181
<i>If you don't vote for her,</i>

38:32.182 --> 38:33.682
I think she might not go up.

38:33.683 --> 38:35.317
Talking to Dana,

38:35.318 --> 38:37.186
she brought up a lot
of really good points.

38:37.187 --> 38:40.122
But Dani had the pork
come back twice.

38:40.123 --> 38:42.358
I don't want to see
Dani go home,

38:42.359 --> 38:44.393
and Kimmie really was
a earlier in the day.

38:44.394 --> 38:48.464
I don't know.

39:02.012 --> 39:07.716
Mexican night.
It was a massacre.

39:07.717 --> 39:10.386
Clemenza,
first nominee and why.

39:10.387 --> 39:12.788
First nominee was Pat.

39:12.789 --> 39:14.723
<i>Just didn't think
the communication was there,</i>

39:14.724 --> 39:15.391
I think he broke down
a little bit.

39:15.392 --> 39:16.659
Never.

39:16.660 --> 39:18.127
Second nominee and why.

39:18.128 --> 39:20.663
Blue team nominated Guy.

39:20.664 --> 39:22.731
He made a few mistakes,
he put some things out wrong

39:22.732 --> 39:25.100
<i>that kinda screwed us.</i>

39:25.101 --> 39:27.403
<i>Barbie, first nominee and why.</i>

39:27.404 --> 39:32.074
The red team's first nominee
tonight was me, chef.

39:32.075 --> 39:33.842
Because I was weeded
on the hot app station.

39:33.843 --> 39:35.744
Second nominee.

39:35.745 --> 39:39.048
Red team's second
nominee tonight...

39:47.174 --> 39:48.941
After a dinner service

39:48.942 --> 39:50.543
that finished with more
chefs in the dorms

39:50.544 --> 39:52.078
than in the kitchen,

39:52.079 --> 39:55.014
the blue team has nominated
Guy and Patrick.

39:55.015 --> 39:57.683
The red team
has nominated Barbie,

39:57.684 --> 39:59.552
and now must give
their second nominee.

39:59.553 --> 40:03.122
The red team's
second nominee tonight...

40:03.123 --> 40:06.325
is Dani, chef.

40:06.326 --> 40:08.661
Because she served
the raw pork,

40:08.662 --> 40:11.897
<i>and just couldn't seem
to get herself together.</i>

40:11.898 --> 40:15.401
<i>Okay, Guy, Patrick,
Barbie, Danielle, step forward.</i>

40:15.402 --> 40:20.339
Let's go.

40:20.340 --> 40:21.340
Patrick.

40:21.341 --> 40:22.808
Yes, chef.

40:22.809 --> 40:24.677
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

40:24.678 --> 40:26.612
I've been consistent,
professional.

40:26.613 --> 40:30.049
<i>Tonight I made a poor
decision on the chicken.</i>

40:30.050 --> 40:32.184
<i>It was the mistake I made
tonight. I own up to that.</i>

40:32.185 --> 40:33.853
But I never make
the same mistake again.

40:33.854 --> 40:35.287
You're beat, aren't you?

40:35.288 --> 40:37.490
I am not beat, chef.
Nowhere near beat.

40:37.491 --> 40:40.259
<i>Guy.
Yes, chef.</i>

40:40.260 --> 40:41.894
<i>Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

40:41.895 --> 40:43.029
<i>First of all,</i>

40:43.030 --> 40:45.031
I've been solid so far,

40:45.032 --> 40:46.966
<i>about everything.</i>

40:46.967 --> 40:48.734
<i>I've never lowered
my standards for nothing.</i>

40:48.735 --> 40:50.703
And I'm definitely a fighter.

40:50.704 --> 40:52.505
<i>Are you in over your head?
No.</i>

40:52.506 --> 40:54.573
I can look you
in the eyes and tell you.

40:54.574 --> 40:57.176
I'm not over my head.

40:57.177 --> 41:00.413
Uh, Danielle.
Back again.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.747
Yes.

41:01.748 --> 41:03.883
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

41:03.884 --> 41:06.052
I put myself on a station
that I've never worked

41:06.053 --> 41:10.723
because I want to be here.
I want to stand out.

41:10.724 --> 41:12.358
Well, yes, I messed up
a pork chop.

41:12.359 --> 41:13.225
And I'll probably
never do that again.

41:13.226 --> 41:15.294
<i>Barbie.
Yes, chef.</i>

41:15.295 --> 41:17.463
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

41:17.464 --> 41:19.165
I don't feel like I deserve
to be up here, chef.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.900
<i>I don't feel like
I'm the weakest, chef.</i>

41:20.901 --> 41:22.902
So I don't feel like
I deserve to be here.

41:22.903 --> 41:24.851
Do you know what?

41:26.940 --> 41:30.976
You're right.
Back in line.

41:30.977 --> 41:35.848
This is tough, this one.

41:40.454 --> 41:44.390
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...
