02:16.375 --> 02:17.608

<i>That girl isn't me.</i>

02:19.646 --> 02:20.944
Grab my balls.

02:20.946 --> 02:22.847
- My Christmas balls.
- Oh, oh, sorry.

02:22.849 --> 02:25.250
Kat, quit daydreaming
and do something.

02:25.252 --> 02:29.086
- Take these.
- And these.

02:29.088 --> 02:31.288
You guys know I'm not
your servant, right?

02:31.290 --> 02:33.159
You kind of are.

02:34.326 --> 02:35.658
Well, I need to get going.

02:35.660 --> 02:37.027
I'm supposed to be at work
in 20 minutes.

02:37.029 --> 02:39.598
Fine, but I need to get
a Starbucks first.

02:42.601 --> 02:44.335
She wants you, Dominic.

02:44.337 --> 02:46.871
- What're you waitin' for?
- Yeah? You should go for her.

02:46.873 --> 02:49.841
- Skylar's not really my type.
- Skylar's everybody's type.

02:49.843 --> 02:52.810
Ah, she's more into her Insta
followers than a relationship.

02:52.812 --> 02:54.679
And who's talking
relationship?

02:54.681 --> 02:56.950
We're just gonna pop in here
for a sec, okay?

02:58.750 --> 03:00.518
Alright, I'm late.
I gotta get to work.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.720
Man, you act like
your dad makes you work.

03:02.722 --> 03:04.389
But you secretly like it.

03:04.391 --> 03:05.823
Yeah, it's..

03:05.825 --> 03:08.025
...like you wanna be
a poor person.

03:08.027 --> 03:10.497
You know, a job probably
won't kill you, Jackson.

03:11.563 --> 03:14.097
Probably not, but...
why take the chance.

03:14.099 --> 03:17.033
Kat, where's the car?
You have one job.

03:17.035 --> 03:18.936
- Sorry.
- Ah, you're dragging the bags.

03:18.938 --> 03:20.437
Use those little spaghetti arms.

03:20.439 --> 03:21.705
- And raise them up.
- Oh, my God!

03:21.707 --> 03:22.840
Is it a sale?

03:22.842 --> 03:24.875
It's Dominic Wintergarden.

03:24.877 --> 03:26.978
'He's like a Kardashian,
but even classy.'

03:26.980 --> 03:28.611
I need to get him
in my vlog.

03:28.613 --> 03:30.080
Take this.
Move, out of my way.

03:30.082 --> 03:32.515
Take this and get out
of my way.

03:36.055 --> 03:38.055
'So clumsy.'

03:38.057 --> 03:42.095
The joy of kindness walked right
into this humiliating situation.

03:46.665 --> 03:48.668
I ordered the decaf.

03:49.301 --> 03:50.800
I am so sorry.

03:50.802 --> 03:53.204
Some clumsy girl,
threw her Starbucks

03:53.206 --> 03:56.373
all over the gorgeous
Dominic Wintergarden.

03:56.375 --> 03:59.477
You okay?
You hurt yourself?

03:59.479 --> 04:00.811
Uh, no.

04:09.122 --> 04:11.555
What a gentleman.

04:11.557 --> 04:15.692
Dominic gets top place
this week at joy of kindness.

04:15.694 --> 04:17.194
What's that? What happened?

04:17.196 --> 04:19.262
Oh, my God!
You totally ruined his shoes!

04:19.265 --> 04:21.630
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.
- 'It's not fine.'

04:21.632 --> 04:24.400
I'm so, so sorry.
Uh, I can replace them.

04:24.402 --> 04:27.371
They don't sell couture
at Nordstrom Rack, sweetie.

04:27.373 --> 04:28.939
Come on.

04:28.941 --> 04:32.208
- 'I'm so sorry, I-I...'
- 'Come on, Dominic.'

04:32.210 --> 04:36.347
And this hot mess gets
the loser of the week award.

04:43.388 --> 04:45.623
I can help you with your ears,
I know how to do all that stuff.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.825
- Yeah, they look so cute.
- Hey!

04:47.827 --> 04:50.994
Hi, Chip the dancin' elf,
you wanna be Chip the fired elf?

04:50.996 --> 04:52.962
Get to work.
Get to work.

04:52.964 --> 04:55.165
Thank you. Move.
Where is she?

04:55.167 --> 04:57.535
She is going to be here,
Mr. Mujiza.

04:57.537 --> 04:59.135
- Just relax.
- You relax, Isla.

04:59.137 --> 05:00.571
I got a line of
pissed-off toddlers

05:00.573 --> 05:02.573
'waiting for Santa
and his elves.'

05:02.575 --> 05:04.340
I don't have a show
if I don't have a star.

05:04.342 --> 05:06.844
- She's fashionably late.
- Fash.. You funny, you...

05:06.846 --> 05:08.345
I'm so sorry, Mr. Mujiza.
I know, I'm...

05:08.347 --> 05:10.513
You're late!
We have two rules here, Kat.

05:10.515 --> 05:11.849
First rule, don't be late.

05:11.851 --> 05:14.085
Other rule,
the most important rule.

05:14.087 --> 05:16.052
All performers in costumes

05:16.054 --> 05:18.054
at all times equals magic.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.224
Yes, I know, it's a stupid rule,
but you like money?

05:20.226 --> 05:22.727
You wanna keep your job
as an elf? Get to work!

05:22.729 --> 05:24.998
- Move. Go. Both of y'all!
- Yes.

05:32.804 --> 05:35.705
Hey, are you the new Santa?

05:35.707 --> 05:37.107
Hey, uh, yeah.

05:37.109 --> 05:38.741
Yeah, yeah,
I just started.

05:38.743 --> 05:40.578
I'm Nick.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.116
Like, Saint Nick.
Cute.

05:46.118 --> 05:48.885
You look like you're having
a little trouble there.

05:48.887 --> 05:52.056
Uh, serious question.

05:52.058 --> 05:53.523
Does this suit make me
look fat?

05:55.527 --> 05:58.563
That's funny. Y'all havin' a
good time as a group of friends.

05:58.565 --> 06:01.701
Do you want me to report you
to Mr. Wintergarden?

06:03.169 --> 06:04.602
Get out there
and do your show!

06:04.604 --> 06:07.140
Santa, a pillow,
a hat, get jolly!

06:08.373 --> 06:09.573
You get Santa pulled together

06:09.575 --> 06:11.174
and I will start
one of our numbers.

06:11.176 --> 06:13.076
- We're going. We're going.
- Wastin' my time.

06:13.078 --> 06:16.179
- Breathe.
- What's wrong with you people?

06:16.181 --> 06:18.816
Uh, sorry, I am..

06:18.818 --> 06:20.284
...obviously not
a professional.

06:20.286 --> 06:23.354
No, whereas I
obviously am.

06:23.356 --> 06:25.422
Uh, I'm Kat by the way.

06:25.424 --> 06:26.724
Hey, have we met before?

06:26.726 --> 06:29.792
Uh, it's kinda hard
to tell with the..

06:29.794 --> 06:31.929
Yeah, you're right.

06:31.931 --> 06:33.998
So, Kat, you're, uh,
one of the Santa Land singers?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.434
Yeah, when I'm not
selling out arenas

06:36.436 --> 06:37.868
I sing here.

06:37.870 --> 06:40.171
But I, I write the music,
so that's a bonus.

06:40.173 --> 06:43.073
Ah, nice. You're a songwriter.
That's awesome.

06:43.075 --> 06:45.277
Yeah, I'm huge with the four
to six year olds.

06:47.546 --> 06:50.614
Okay, that's it.
Give me this.

06:50.616 --> 06:54.318
Now, Santa's been on a cleanse,
that is way better.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.421
Ah, yeah, you fill out
the suit quite nicely.

06:57.423 --> 07:01.292
I mean, you know,
with-without the pillows.

07:01.294 --> 07:03.096
I mean, um..

07:04.395 --> 07:06.265
So, you ready to go?

07:12.371 --> 07:13.837
No, I think
you'll really like it

07:13.839 --> 07:15.974
Yeah, i-i-it's cheesy,
but it's good.

09:00.645 --> 09:02.446
So..

09:02.448 --> 09:04.514

09:04.516 --> 09:07.518
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.220
Sure you don't.

09:09.222 --> 09:12.388
Come on, I have to
tell you about the super-fun

09:12.390 --> 09:14.691
mortifying adventure
with my steps today.

09:14.693 --> 09:16.093
Yeah.

09:16.095 --> 09:18.162
And you're sure
it was Dominic Wintergarden?

09:18.164 --> 09:19.997
Oh, a hundred percent.

09:19.999 --> 09:22.832
He was... surrounded
by all of his rich friends.

09:22.834 --> 09:26.170
Oh, his girlfriend
insulted my shoes.

09:26.172 --> 09:27.604
I like your shoes.

09:27.606 --> 09:29.840
Yeah, it was like a scene
from a horror movie.

09:29.842 --> 09:32.075
Everyone was laughing
and staring at me.

09:32.077 --> 09:33.710
And the steps did nothing.

09:33.712 --> 09:35.012
Oh, no, they did something.

09:35.014 --> 09:37.814
Joy took a video of it
and put it on her vlog.

09:37.816 --> 09:41.250
Yeah.
Oh, so humiliating.

09:41.252 --> 09:44.021
If I ever saw him again,
I would die.

09:44.023 --> 09:45.590
I mean, that's kind of unlikely

09:45.592 --> 09:47.557
'cause we run
in different circles.

09:47.559 --> 09:50.793
But, you know
who does run in our circle?

09:50.795 --> 09:52.362
- Sexy Santa.
- Isla.

09:52.364 --> 09:55.532
I'm just saying, I wonder
if Mr. Mujiza has rules

09:55.534 --> 09:57.468
where elves can't
hook-up with Mr. Claus.

09:57.470 --> 10:01.370
He hasn't even seen me
with... out my elf face.

10:01.372 --> 10:04.175
- But your elf face is so cute.
- Okay, it's not happening.

10:04.177 --> 10:07.277
I'm just saying, he looked
really into it today.

10:07.279 --> 10:10.413
You sounded amazing
and the song was so good.

10:10.415 --> 10:13.051
Yeah, well, I liked it better
watching you do it.

10:13.818 --> 10:15.484
Why are you so scared?

10:15.486 --> 10:17.821
You're so talented, Kat,
if I had half your voice

10:17.823 --> 10:20.224
I would be a star.

10:20.226 --> 10:21.859
If I had half your
self-confidence

10:21.861 --> 10:23.896
I'd rule the world.

10:26.731 --> 10:29.133
'Real housewives
of Manhattan Beach..'

10:29.135 --> 10:32.069
No, no, Grace,
th-the stamp is upside-down.

10:32.071 --> 10:34.104
Stamps go in the corner,
I've seen mail, mom.

10:34.106 --> 10:36.806
Yes, but the actual stamp
is upside-down.

10:36.808 --> 10:39.409
Details matter. You don't
want people thinking you're simple.

10:39.411 --> 10:42.012
Oh-ho, my hand, it's killing me.

10:42.014 --> 10:43.681
My tongue is dry.

10:43.683 --> 10:45.081
Sorry, I'm late.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.018
The line was around
the corner tonight.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.686
How dare you just waltz in here

10:48.688 --> 10:50.387
after a night out on the town?

10:50.389 --> 10:53.389
- I've been working.
- Tomato, tamato.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.825
While you were off
in your fantasy world

10:54.827 --> 10:55.859
of being Debbie Gibson...

10:55.861 --> 10:56.893
I don't know who that is.

10:56.895 --> 10:58.261
The point is, these girls

10:58.263 --> 10:59.797
were here doing your work

10:59.799 --> 11:01.031
'and poor Joy is suffering'

11:01.033 --> 11:02.899
from carpal tunnel and Grace..

11:02.901 --> 11:04.902
- My tongue is so dry.
- Hm.

11:06.270 --> 11:09.505
Oh, Bruno, that's my boy.
Hi!

11:09.507 --> 11:11.941
That mangy, flea-bitten
wheelbarrow dog

11:11.943 --> 11:13.143
peed in the corner.

11:13.145 --> 11:15.414
Well, did anybody
take him out?

11:18.885 --> 11:20.750
- Well, I'll clean it up.
- Of course, you will.

11:20.752 --> 11:22.887
You'll also do the dishes,
the floors, the laundry.

11:22.889 --> 11:24.220
You have to hand wash
my Spanx.

11:24.222 --> 11:25.955
And get the hair clog
out of my shower.

11:25.957 --> 11:27.157
You need to Febreze
all my shoes.

11:27.159 --> 11:28.691
And address all those cards.

11:28.693 --> 11:30.726
- We've to get them out first.
- What are those for?

11:30.728 --> 11:32.329
We've been here months now
and haven't received

11:32.331 --> 11:34.230
a single invitation
to anything

11:34.232 --> 11:35.932
'I'm sending those out
to all the affluent...'

11:35.934 --> 11:37.500
- And rich.
- Families of the city.

11:37.502 --> 11:41.171
- With single sons for us...
- Do-do.. Don't tell her.

11:41.173 --> 11:44.041
Alright, well, just let me
take Bruno out

11:44.043 --> 11:45.710
and then I'll be back
to do my chores.

11:45.712 --> 11:47.679
Aren't you forgetting something?

11:49.715 --> 11:51.215
We all have to contribute.

11:51.217 --> 11:53.117
That dog eats his weight
in kibble.

11:53.119 --> 11:55.652
Remind me how we're all
contributing again.

11:55.654 --> 11:57.753
You're so ungrateful.

11:57.755 --> 11:59.255
How am I ungrateful?

11:59.257 --> 12:01.224
I work six hours a day
at Santa Land.

12:01.226 --> 12:02.558
Santa Land.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.027
I do holiday singing grams
every night.

12:04.029 --> 12:06.363
- Quit bragging.
- I'm not bragging.

12:06.365 --> 12:09.365
I just would like to keep
some of my tip money

12:09.367 --> 12:13.036
since you won't give me
any of the money my dad left me.

12:13.038 --> 12:16.907
He gave it to me to use
as I see fit until you turn 18.

12:16.909 --> 12:18.374
And I don't see fit otherwise.

12:18.376 --> 12:20.244
- Why?
- How dare you.

12:20.246 --> 12:21.845
Your father left me
a widow.

12:21.847 --> 12:23.147
He left you everything.

12:23.149 --> 12:25.282
Watch your mouth.

12:25.284 --> 12:28.087
You know, anything can happen
in four months.

12:35.060 --> 12:36.695

Hey, dad,
what's up?

15:06.877 --> 15:08.711
Oh, hey, Nick.

15:08.713 --> 15:12.615
Oh, huh, you, uh,
going in to work today?

15:12.617 --> 15:14.218
Family tradition, you know?

15:14.220 --> 15:16.452
Yeah, I know. I'm, uh,
goin' in this afternoon.

15:16.454 --> 15:18.422
Oh, good, good.

15:18.424 --> 15:21.191
Hey, uh, dad, I wanted
to ask you something.

15:21.193 --> 15:22.926
Yeah?

15:22.928 --> 15:24.961
Well, I had an idea
for this year's gala.

15:24.963 --> 15:26.763
Uh-huh.

15:26.765 --> 15:28.398
Give me a sec.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.099
Uh, you know,
like with the entertainment.

15:30.101 --> 15:31.868
I've been workin' on something.

15:31.870 --> 15:33.636
Yeah, I gotta take this.

15:33.638 --> 15:36.606
- Hello, yeah?
- Got it.

15:36.608 --> 15:38.210
Uh-huh.

15:39.745 --> 15:42.046
Nick?

15:42.048 --> 15:44.348
Tell me what you had
in your mind.

15:44.350 --> 15:46.749
Uh, no, do your thing.

15:46.751 --> 15:48.784
It's all good.

15:48.786 --> 15:50.422
See you, dad.

15:52.323 --> 15:53.956
I'm here.

15:53.958 --> 15:58.427
Oh, my God, I got over 10,000
views on my Starbucks girl vlog.

15:58.429 --> 16:00.129
At least, Kat is good
for something.

16:00.131 --> 16:01.665
Yeah, she needs to get
a life.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.133
- Right.
- 'Girls.'

16:03.135 --> 16:06.806
The Wintergarden's just
announced their Christmas gala.

16:08.174 --> 16:10.806
Oh, it's an animal charity.

16:10.808 --> 16:12.908
Oh, what a waste
of perfectly good money.

16:12.910 --> 16:15.878
Dominic's dad?
God, he's so crazy rich!

16:15.880 --> 16:18.614
He owns, like, half the hotels
in the city.

16:18.616 --> 16:20.550
Do you think Dominic has seen
my vlog?

16:20.552 --> 16:22.085
Hotels, restaurants.

16:22.087 --> 16:24.821
He even owns that Santa Land,
Kat works at.

16:24.823 --> 16:25.989
Santa Land.

16:25.991 --> 16:28.425
Who cares?
We're not invited.

16:28.427 --> 16:30.261
His wife died last year

16:30.263 --> 16:33.997
leaving your Dominic
without a mommy.

16:33.999 --> 16:36.867
I think, he'd be delighted

16:36.869 --> 16:39.301
to meet a widow as..

16:39.303 --> 16:42.940
...fit and available
as myself.

16:42.942 --> 16:44.606
Ew, gross, mom.

16:44.608 --> 16:46.810
And Dominic will be there.

16:46.812 --> 16:48.277
I have to get into
that party.

16:48.279 --> 16:49.479
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

16:49.481 --> 16:51.380
- But how?
- I'm trying to ask you.

16:51.382 --> 16:55.351
- Oh.
- Dead dad was his total bestie.

16:55.353 --> 16:57.622
- What?
- Who?

16:58.991 --> 17:00.157
- Dead dad.
- Who?

17:00.159 --> 17:01.959
- What?
- Dead dad.

17:01.961 --> 17:03.627
Are you talking
about Kat's father?

17:03.629 --> 17:05.328
That's what I said, dead dad.

17:05.329 --> 17:07.296
It's in all Kat's photobooks.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.568
- Move.
- Get out of my way, mom.

17:20.878 --> 17:24.445
"Kilimanjaro, 2002,
Wintergarden and Decker."

17:24.448 --> 17:25.881
"North Pole, 2005."

17:25.883 --> 17:27.751
"Terry Wintergarden
and Jason Decker"

17:27.752 --> 17:30.320
All these stupid trips
he took before we met.

17:30.322 --> 17:31.654
Taking care of wildebeests

17:31.656 --> 17:33.622
or one-legged flamingoes
or something.

17:33.624 --> 17:36.459
- Maybe it will finally pay off.
- What're we looking for?

17:36.461 --> 17:38.227
Anything that will get us
into that party.

17:38.229 --> 17:40.429
What is this garbage?

17:40.431 --> 17:42.398
"I won't be fake,
I will not break."

17:42.400 --> 17:44.434
"I'll be the change,
unique and strange."

17:45.469 --> 17:46.837
She sounds like a psycho.

17:46.839 --> 17:49.005
Do you think anybody cares
about her stupid songs?

17:49.007 --> 17:50.506
Oh, and then there's
this silly little thing.

17:50.508 --> 17:51.707
She's always looking at

17:51.709 --> 17:53.409
like it's goin' to start
talking to her.

17:53.411 --> 17:55.046
I have no friends.

17:56.648 --> 17:58.782
"North Pole, 2005."

17:58.784 --> 18:01.851
Wintergarden was on this trip.
Oh, this is good.

18:01.853 --> 18:03.852
- This is good.
- What do you do with it?

18:03.854 --> 18:05.121
What you do with it
doesn't matter.

18:05.123 --> 18:06.689
- It's what it does for us.
- Yeah?

18:06.691 --> 18:09.391
Joy, hide this in your room,
keep looking.

18:09.393 --> 18:11.029
Keep looking.

18:12.965 --> 18:15.197
<i>My dear Mr. Wintergarden</i>

18:15.199 --> 18:18.033
<i>it is with great sadness
I must inform you</i>

18:18.035 --> 18:20.802
<i>of my beloved husband,
Jason Decker's death.</i>

18:20.804 --> 18:22.772
<i>The photos from your
journeys together</i>

18:22.774 --> 18:24.174
<i>to the Antarctic icebergs</i>

18:24.176 --> 18:26.275
<i>and the misty Tanzawa Ranges
in Japan</i>

18:26.277 --> 18:28.544
<i>made me feel
such a connection to you.</i>

18:28.546 --> 18:30.613
...Jason in India
with Wintergarden?

18:30.615 --> 18:31.680
Let's find out.

18:31.682 --> 18:33.448
<i>He considered you family,</i>

18:33.450 --> 18:34.484
<i>and so shall I.</i>

18:34.486 --> 18:36.052
Let's work on the Antarctic,

18:36.054 --> 18:37.186
the light hitting the ice..

18:39.457 --> 18:41.291
<i>We relocated here, this year.</i>

18:41.293 --> 18:44.093
<i>And it would be our privilege
to meet with you to honor</i>

18:44.095 --> 18:45.128
<i>the memory of Jason.</i>

18:45.130 --> 18:47.597
...misty Tanzawa Mountain
Ranges.

18:47.599 --> 18:50.501
<i>Our family is generally
free this holiday season</i>

18:50.503 --> 18:52.801
<i>reserving the daylight hours
to attend to the needs</i>

18:52.803 --> 18:55.872
<i>of sick and homeless
shelter animals.</i>

18:58.677 --> 19:01.781
<i>With fond regards,
Deirdre Decker.</i>

19:04.749 --> 19:06.382
'I've got the groceries.'

19:08.119 --> 19:10.587
Those are my books.
Why is my stuff out?

19:10.589 --> 19:12.254
That's what I want to know.

19:12.256 --> 19:13.389
I think the dog did it.

19:13.391 --> 19:14.893
Clean it up.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.097
Oh, and you're trending
Starbucks girl.

19:20.098 --> 19:21.098
You can thank me now.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.698
Okay, you need
to take that down.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.167
Deirdre she's ruining my life.

19:24.169 --> 19:27.038
You're lucky to be part
of her artistic vision.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.805
Well, I have to get to work.

19:29.807 --> 19:32.407
Oh, the dog also pooped
in the corner.

19:32.409 --> 19:33.676
I'll take care of it.

19:33.678 --> 19:35.448
I already did.

19:36.582 --> 19:38.514
- Thank you, Grace.
- I put it on your bed.

19:38.516 --> 19:39.985
Oh.

19:45.890 --> 19:47.690
'My snow globe is missing.'

19:47.692 --> 19:49.727
'Well, has anyone seen it?'

19:50.996 --> 19:53.466
- Oh, uh, we...
- No idea.

19:54.466 --> 19:55.932
Uh, no idea.

19:55.934 --> 19:57.967
Well, could you guys
please help me look for it?

19:57.969 --> 19:59.636
It's really important to me.

19:59.638 --> 20:02.338
It's important to me that you
stop yammering and go to work

20:02.340 --> 20:05.175
'so I can binge watch "The
housewives of Manhattan Beach."'

20:09.880 --> 20:12.115
Merry Christmas.

20:12.117 --> 20:13.786
And off you go.

20:18.357 --> 20:19.825
Hey, you okay?

20:20.559 --> 20:22.628
Oh, yeah, it's nothing.

20:24.929 --> 20:26.428
Hey, you're really good
with them.

20:26.430 --> 20:28.698
Oh, well, I like kids.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.867
Comes pretty natural to me.

20:30.869 --> 20:32.569
Makes me think of
my parents.

20:32.571 --> 20:34.740
Oh, yeah, where are they?

20:35.207 --> 20:36.809
Oh, um..

20:37.876 --> 20:39.841
My mom died when I was eight.

20:39.843 --> 20:42.478
And my dad died
a couple of years ago.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.749
I am so sorry.

20:46.884 --> 20:49.254
I kinda suck at
jolly and merry.

20:51.022 --> 20:52.554
Why don't you come
and sit on Santa's lap

20:52.556 --> 20:55.657
and tell me what you want
for Christmas, little elf?

20:55.659 --> 20:57.627
That is so incredibly creepy.

20:57.629 --> 20:59.998
- Too much?
- A little bit. Little bit.

21:01.199 --> 21:02.865
But, uh, for real.

21:02.867 --> 21:04.904
What's your
Christmas wish, Kat?

21:05.670 --> 21:07.469
Oh, it's..

21:07.471 --> 21:08.705
It's not possible.

21:08.707 --> 21:10.106
It's not even
a wish really.

21:10.108 --> 21:12.641
It's more like
a unlikely dream.

21:12.643 --> 21:14.112
Tell me.

21:17.716 --> 21:19.882
I wanna write and sing songs.

21:19.884 --> 21:21.618
Like, not for Santa Land

21:21.620 --> 21:25.855
but for movies
and Broadway shows.

21:25.857 --> 21:28.594
I-I wanna sell out arenas.

21:29.761 --> 21:32.763
Oh, my God,
that sounded so cringey.

21:32.765 --> 21:34.731
- I'm so sorry.
- Why? Why?

21:34.733 --> 21:38.201
If you can write
as well as you can sing

21:38.203 --> 21:40.072
what's holding you back?

21:42.573 --> 21:44.407
My dad used to say

21:44.409 --> 21:46.879
if I could dream it,
I could be it.

21:48.546 --> 21:51.080
I used to believe that.

21:51.082 --> 21:53.249
I know that sounds
so cheesy.

21:53.251 --> 21:55.385
Oh, my God. Can we stop talking
about me? It's your turn.

21:55.387 --> 21:57.686
Oh, definitely not happening.
No way.

21:57.688 --> 21:59.888
Whoa!
You are the biggest jerk.

21:59.890 --> 22:02.628
Come on.
Come on.

22:05.530 --> 22:07.696
I have a couple of bands.

22:07.698 --> 22:08.831
Why are we whispering?

22:08.833 --> 22:11.301
Because I don't want
my dad to hear.

22:11.303 --> 22:13.101
Is your dad,
Mr. Mujiza?

22:14.339 --> 22:17.206
No, I just, I'm gonna
keep it on the D-L.

22:17.208 --> 22:20.310
Okay, uh, you sing in a couple
of bands, that's cool.

22:20.312 --> 22:22.012
No, I-I manage 'em.

22:22.014 --> 22:25.514
- Have you heard of Trash File?
- Uh, maybe.

22:25.516 --> 22:27.082
DJ Sock Puppet?

22:27.084 --> 22:29.285
Oh, yeah.
I mean they're...

22:29.287 --> 22:30.785
- Well, that's my..
- Hi, Santa.

22:30.787 --> 22:33.724
Ho-ho-ho, it's a lot
on that list, huh?

22:33.726 --> 22:35.058
Okay, smile for the camera.

22:35.060 --> 22:38.764
- Big picture. Smile.
- And off you go.

22:40.064 --> 22:42.331
So, yeah, that's my band.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.099
That's awesome.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.769
Why would you keep that
from your dad?

22:45.771 --> 22:47.870
I don't know, I..

22:47.872 --> 22:49.839
I like music.

22:49.841 --> 22:52.074
And I'm good at it.

22:52.076 --> 22:53.576
But I just don't think
it's what my dad

22:53.578 --> 22:55.278
had in mind for me.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.983
I don't know. I'm just afraid
I'll disappoint him.

23:01.754 --> 23:05.288
Well, I think your dad
will be proud of you.

23:05.290 --> 23:07.189
Thanks.

23:07.191 --> 23:09.327
I think your dad will be too.

23:13.631 --> 23:15.098
What?

23:15.100 --> 23:16.765
Uh, sorry to bother you...

23:16.767 --> 23:18.734
Not interested.

23:18.736 --> 23:21.771
I'm here on behalf
of Mr. Wintergarden.

23:29.747 --> 23:31.880
Are you okay?

23:31.882 --> 23:35.452
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

23:35.454 --> 23:37.285
Uh, please, please, come in.

23:37.287 --> 23:38.823
'Come in.'

23:40.191 --> 23:43.592
Can I offer you a-a refreshment?
Some-some coffee?

23:43.594 --> 23:45.061
Something stronger?

23:45.063 --> 23:47.730
No, I'm, I'm working.

23:47.732 --> 23:51.935
You were saying,
Mr. Wintergarden sent you.

23:51.937 --> 23:55.538
Yes, I'm looking
for the lady of the house.

23:55.540 --> 23:57.773
You found her.

23:57.775 --> 23:58.942
Wonderful.

23:58.944 --> 24:01.176
Oh. Ignore him.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.146
He showed up years ago,
and we can't get rid of him.

24:03.148 --> 24:04.446
You know the Wintergarden's
are all about

24:04.448 --> 24:05.982
helping out special animals
like this.

24:05.984 --> 24:07.582
And he can't get rid of us.

24:07.584 --> 24:11.387
We absolutely adore him.

24:13.890 --> 24:15.090
Don't take it personally.

24:15.092 --> 24:18.360
He's, um, nervous
around strangers.

24:18.362 --> 24:20.064
Hmm.
He came right up to me.

24:21.632 --> 24:23.867
So, you were saying..

24:23.869 --> 24:27.971
Yes, it is my privilege
to present to

24:27.973 --> 24:30.273
Mrs. Jason Decker,
that is you, yes?

24:30.275 --> 24:32.210
In the flesh.

24:34.078 --> 24:36.611
And his daughter
Katherine Decker

24:36.613 --> 24:38.514
two invitations

24:38.516 --> 24:41.984
to the annual
Wintergarden Christmas Eve Gala.

24:41.986 --> 24:43.352
Just five days away.

24:43.354 --> 24:47.389
And a personal letter
to you and Katherine

24:47.391 --> 24:49.224
from Mr. Wintergarden.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.293
He remembers Katherine, then?

24:51.295 --> 24:53.530
When he was reading
your e-mail his eyes lit up

24:53.532 --> 24:54.830
like it was Christmas morning.

24:54.832 --> 24:56.131
- Did they?
- They did.

24:56.133 --> 24:58.033
And in the true spirit
of the season...

24:58.035 --> 25:00.302
Yes, yes, true spirit,
that's wonderful.

25:00.304 --> 25:03.004
There's just
the teensiest misunderstanding.

25:03.006 --> 25:05.108
You see, I have two daughters.

25:05.110 --> 25:06.842
And it wouldn't be Christmas

25:06.844 --> 25:10.146
if I had to leave
the younger one here, alone.

25:10.148 --> 25:11.848
I just have
the one daughter here.

25:11.850 --> 25:14.449
It's just, my youngest daughter
is special.

25:14.451 --> 25:16.519
Children are gifts.

25:16.521 --> 25:17.753
Aren't they, though?

25:17.755 --> 25:21.657
It's just this one is <i>special.</i>

25:21.659 --> 25:23.426
Like the dog.

25:23.428 --> 25:25.797
And it is a charity.

25:26.596 --> 25:29.133
A Christmas charity.

25:38.176 --> 25:40.743
Well, it has been
such a pleasure.

25:40.745 --> 25:45.082
I am so looking forward to
helping the hippos and all that.

25:46.050 --> 25:48.384
Hot Santa is so into you.

25:48.386 --> 25:49.551
No, he's not.

25:49.553 --> 25:50.953
And I think you're into him.

25:50.955 --> 25:52.554
I am not.

25:52.556 --> 25:53.790
I saw you guys today.

25:53.792 --> 25:55.692
You were like laser beams
on each other.

25:55.694 --> 25:56.859
- It's not like that.
- Ah..

25:56.861 --> 25:58.895
He's just a good listener.

25:58.897 --> 26:01.296
I started talking about my dad
and how he used to tell me..

26:01.298 --> 26:02.999
If you could dream it,
you could be it?

26:03.001 --> 26:06.734
Yeah. Oh, right there.
I don't know.

26:06.736 --> 26:09.071
Just when we were talking today
he made me feel like

26:09.073 --> 26:10.506
there could be
something more for me.

26:10.508 --> 26:13.243
There will be, Kat.
You're extraordinary.

26:13.245 --> 26:15.343
You just don't know it yet.

26:15.345 --> 26:18.813
But you know who knows it?
Hot Santa.

26:18.815 --> 26:19.982
Why are you so weird?

26:19.984 --> 26:21.649
He knows it
and he wants to get it.

26:21.651 --> 26:23.919
- No, he doesn't.
- And you wanna get it too.

26:23.921 --> 26:27.890

hot sexy Santa.

It's never, ever fair.

Calm down, darling.

27:21.545 --> 27:22.645

27:22.647 --> 27:24.879
She doesn't even know
about the gala.

27:24.881 --> 27:28.117
- It's pronounced gala.
- What?

27:28.119 --> 27:32.053
I've been working
on my upper-class accent.

27:32.055 --> 27:34.090
I didn't even get to work
on an accent.

27:34.092 --> 27:35.890
There's no accent.
Pull it together.

27:35.892 --> 27:37.526
I am way better than, Kat.

27:37.528 --> 27:39.728
Dominic would never go

You're right.

27:47.205 --> 27:50.072

four years old.

33:14.098 --> 33:15.764
like that.

33:15.766 --> 33:18.503
You would
look amazing in that.

33:19.403 --> 33:22.105
Not in this lifetime, though.

33:22.107 --> 33:23.371
Who knows?

33:23.373 --> 33:25.808
You're due for
a Christmas miracle.

33:25.810 --> 33:28.709
I'd settle for a lock
on my door.

33:28.711 --> 33:30.678
I mean, a miracle would
be better, I'm just saying.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.313
'Oh, but seriously.
What I'm gonna wear?'

33:35.085 --> 33:36.918
- Oh, why not?
- Maybe this one, come here.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.521
Come tighten me, because
if I'm not gonna do this..

33:38.523 --> 33:40.122
Obviously this one
makes you look fat.

33:40.124 --> 33:42.358
Well, I'm not..
I hate every single dress.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.793
From the looks of the
dresses, they hate you, too.

33:46.864 --> 33:48.696
Potatoes wear sacks
better than you.

33:48.698 --> 33:51.333
Oh, kindness, Joy,
like your vlog.

33:51.335 --> 33:52.568
I apologize.

33:52.570 --> 33:54.169
You have the perfect figure

33:54.171 --> 33:55.538
for a potato sack.

33:55.540 --> 33:56.738
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

33:56.740 --> 34:00.108
Whoa, what's goin' on here?

34:00.110 --> 34:02.744
Well, she's going to find out
sooner or later.

34:02.746 --> 34:05.883
We've been invited to
the Wintergarden Charity Gala.

34:07.383 --> 34:09.784
- W-we have?
- No, no, no, no.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.320
We have.

34:11.322 --> 34:14.054
Oh, look at you, so sad.

34:14.056 --> 34:15.591
Oh, oh, he-he-he.

34:15.592 --> 34:17.693
Don't cry on the dresses,
they're not paid for yet.

34:17.695 --> 34:20.062
- Oh!
- Kindness, ladies.

34:20.063 --> 34:22.797
Poor girl. We only received
three tickets.

34:22.800 --> 34:26.367
Although I did everything in my
power to try to get a fourth.

34:26.369 --> 34:28.137
How did you get tickets?

34:28.139 --> 34:29.637
Well, what do you think
I do all day?

34:29.639 --> 34:31.371
Troll the internet
and wear spray tan.

34:31.373 --> 34:34.010
You know speaking of tanning,
you could use some color.

34:34.012 --> 34:37.911
- You like a fetus.
- So small, can't even talk.

34:37.914 --> 34:40.614
I slave away for this family
trying to make ends meet.

34:40.617 --> 34:42.551
- Well, my father...
- Your father..

34:42.553 --> 34:43.818
You think traipsing
around the world

34:43.820 --> 34:45.652
saving manatees,
feeds the family?

34:45.655 --> 34:47.255
You're as pathetic as he was.

34:47.257 --> 34:49.958

I'm saying no to that one.'

34:49.960 --> 34:52.726

I know Mr. Mujiza has his rules,
but..

36:03.300 --> 36:04.566
...I'm gonna take off my beard.

36:04.568 --> 36:05.867
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

36:05.869 --> 36:07.468
And you're gonna take off
your hat, your wig

36:07.470 --> 36:09.171
and your cute little
elf ears.

36:09.173 --> 36:11.941
No, no, I mean..

36:11.943 --> 36:16.412
Yeah, I-I'd like you to take off
your whole thing.

36:16.414 --> 36:19.347
The Santa bit,
not like everything.

36:19.349 --> 36:21.115
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

36:21.117 --> 36:22.818
Okay, rule number one

36:22.820 --> 36:24.486
costumes equal magic.

36:24.488 --> 36:27.455
Forget rule number one,
alright?

36:27.457 --> 36:29.992
I want you to know
the real me.

36:29.994 --> 36:32.426
And I wanna know
the real you.

36:32.428 --> 36:34.129
Oh, God.

36:34.131 --> 36:35.800
Wait, uh..

36:38.401 --> 36:40.001
Alright.

36:40.003 --> 36:41.537
I took off mine.

36:41.539 --> 36:43.137
Now you take off yours.

36:45.008 --> 36:46.711
This is crazy.

36:49.613 --> 36:51.081
Okay.

36:54.617 --> 36:57.184
- Mm..
- Oh, nice ears.

36:57.186 --> 36:59.787
Be quiet.

36:59.789 --> 37:03.024
- Okay. Now you.
- Alright.

37:03.026 --> 37:04.193
Here goes nothing.

37:12.135 --> 37:13.836
Oh, my God.

37:13.838 --> 37:16.508
You're Dominic Wintergarden.

37:17.575 --> 37:19.307
Yeah.

37:19.309 --> 37:21.343
- Okay, so you own all of...
- No, but..

37:21.345 --> 37:24.079
My dad does. But hold on,
don't change the subject.

37:24.081 --> 37:26.213
It's your turn.

37:26.215 --> 37:27.684
Um..

37:28.318 --> 37:29.751
I can't.

37:29.753 --> 37:32.387
I, um, don't wanna get fired.

37:32.389 --> 37:34.055
- Oh, come on.
- No, seriously.

37:34.057 --> 37:36.727
You can't lose your job,
I can.

37:37.727 --> 37:40.629
Okay.
Okay, you're right.

37:40.631 --> 37:41.729
- It's just...
- Okay, wait.

37:41.731 --> 37:43.131
- Um..
- Yeah.

37:43.133 --> 37:44.633
The gala,
wh-what about the gala?

37:44.635 --> 37:46.135
You're gonna go, right?

37:47.572 --> 37:49.872
Yeah, I was planning on it.

37:49.874 --> 37:52.340
'Cause you're
Dominic Wintergarden, yeah.

37:52.342 --> 37:54.276
Um..

37:54.278 --> 37:56.080
What if we met there?

37:57.180 --> 37:59.316
Like a blind date?

38:00.517 --> 38:03.253
Yeah, like a, a blind date.

38:05.588 --> 38:07.388
I wanna kiss you.

38:11.494 --> 38:13.461
We're up!

38:13.463 --> 38:15.963
Or we can be up later.

38:15.965 --> 38:18.633
Oh, my God.
You're Dominic Wintergarden.

38:18.635 --> 38:20.503
I'm gonna go..

38:20.505 --> 38:22.370
...feed the reindeer.

38:22.372 --> 38:23.840
Mm.

38:27.677 --> 38:30.044
What is happening?

38:31.782 --> 38:34.515
Do you wanna be singin' elves
or toilet scrubbin' elves?

38:34.517 --> 38:35.783
- 'On the stage now.'
- Mm.

38:35.785 --> 38:37.921
I need to hear everything.

38:38.389 --> 38:39.923
Come on.

38:53.537 --> 38:55.137
Oh, hi.

38:55.139 --> 38:57.773
'Uh, sorry,
I-I didn't see you there.'

38:57.775 --> 39:00.075
Hello, dear.

39:00.077 --> 39:02.977
You seem happy.

39:02.979 --> 39:05.180
Huh? No.

39:05.182 --> 39:06.948
I'm, I'm not.

39:06.950 --> 39:09.017
I'm not, not, um..

39:09.019 --> 39:11.687
- Where is everyone?
- They're out.

39:11.689 --> 39:13.825
It's just us girls.

39:15.758 --> 39:18.929
- Are you okay, Deirdre?
- Mm-hm.

39:20.030 --> 39:22.633
We never spend any
time together.

39:30.974 --> 39:33.209
You're writing a new song.

39:33.211 --> 39:34.742
Oh, it's nothing.

39:34.744 --> 39:36.544
It's not nothing.

39:36.546 --> 39:39.046
It's your dream, isn't it?

39:39.048 --> 39:42.119
- N-no.
- Aren't dreams wonderful?

39:42.986 --> 39:45.387
I used to have dreams.

39:45.389 --> 39:46.988
Did you know that?

39:46.990 --> 39:48.155
Um... no.

39:48.157 --> 39:50.758
I was a beautiful dancer
when I was young.

39:50.760 --> 39:52.894
I was going to be
a prima ballerina.

39:52.896 --> 39:55.700
- Don't laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing.

39:57.101 --> 39:59.867
I didn't always look like this.

39:59.869 --> 40:01.702
I was a swan.

40:01.704 --> 40:05.374
I had the best arabesque
in New Mexico.

40:05.376 --> 40:08.109
And do you know what happened?

40:08.111 --> 40:09.410
Bunions!

40:09.412 --> 40:10.745
Bunions happened.

40:10.747 --> 40:13.816
Ruining my beautiful
dancing feet. Look at them.

40:13.818 --> 40:18.086
Oh, I'm so sorry, Deirdre.

40:23.227 --> 40:25.394
And I'll tell you
something else, missy.

40:27.331 --> 40:28.700
I was a true artist.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.501
And I can still
recognize talent.

40:33.503 --> 40:35.072
And you, my dear..

40:37.275 --> 40:39.106
...don't have it. Heh.

40:39.108 --> 40:41.876
So you should just keep
that little job at Santa Land

40:41.878 --> 40:44.780
because that's all
you're ever going to be.

40:44.782 --> 40:47.349
And this little song notebook,
well, you might as well burn it.

40:47.351 --> 40:50.084
Because it will never be more
than a sad reminder

40:50.086 --> 40:52.488
of your unfulfilled dreams.

40:54.423 --> 40:56.892
Mom, Joy said I weigh
more than my I.Q.

40:56.894 --> 40:58.792
You do.

40:58.794 --> 40:59.928
She does.

40:59.930 --> 41:01.396
I have a very slim I.Q.

41:01.398 --> 41:04.235
Yes, you do, dear.
Yes, you do.

41:05.235 --> 41:08.271
Lovely chatting with you.
Mm.

41:25.488 --> 41:27.021
Hey.

41:27.023 --> 41:28.890
What's with the face?

41:28.892 --> 41:30.559
Deirdre reminded me
that I'll never amount

41:30.561 --> 41:32.528
to anything more than
a minimum wage elf.

41:32.530 --> 41:35.997
Your stepmom is a jealous
old crone.

41:35.999 --> 41:37.932
She can bear the fact
that you have more talent

41:37.934 --> 41:39.066
in your big toe than she

41:39.068 --> 41:41.669
and her horrible
daughters combined.

41:41.671 --> 41:42.970
- Thank you.
- And..

41:42.972 --> 41:45.173
Did she happen to see
that elf hooking up with

41:45.175 --> 41:48.145
Dominic-fricking-Wintergarden
yesterday?

41:50.046 --> 41:53.215
Kat, he was falling
all over himself for you.

41:53.217 --> 41:54.716
This is epic.

41:54.718 --> 41:57.718
What did he say when he realized
you were a Starbucks girl?

41:57.720 --> 41:58.954
He didn't.

41:58.956 --> 42:00.155
He didn't recognize you?

42:00.157 --> 42:02.260
I didn't take off my wig.

42:02.659 --> 42:03.861
Why?

42:05.262 --> 42:08.196
He probably would not have
even remembered you from that.

42:08.198 --> 42:10.198
Everyone remembers me
from that, yeah.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.401
Thanks to Joy, I'm viral.

42:12.403 --> 42:13.936
I told him
I'll see him at the gala.

42:15.773 --> 42:18.773
- Isla, I like him.
- Hm.

42:18.775 --> 42:20.809
Like, I really,
really like him.

42:20.811 --> 42:22.410
But when he finds out

42:22.412 --> 42:24.579
that I'm sad little
Starbucks girl

42:24.581 --> 42:25.981
who wears knock-off brands

42:25.983 --> 42:28.983
and gets bullied
by her step-family, uh, I..

42:28.985 --> 42:31.919
I don't know, he won't
ever wanna see me again.

42:31.921 --> 42:33.320
Okay, first of all

42:33.322 --> 42:35.925
you make knock-offs
look like couture.

42:35.927 --> 42:38.426
And second,
once you turn 18

42:38.428 --> 42:39.693
it's bye-bye bullies.

42:39.695 --> 42:41.763
True.

42:41.765 --> 42:44.367
Yeah.
So let's stop moping.

42:45.769 --> 42:48.803
Now, I brought you here
for a reason.

42:48.805 --> 42:50.805
Mm, very mysterious.

42:50.807 --> 42:52.740
I, as you know

42:52.742 --> 42:54.209
am hopeless romantic.

42:54.211 --> 42:57.144
And when I see a love garden
trying to blossom

42:57.146 --> 42:58.280
I have to tend to its soil.

42:58.282 --> 42:59.481
What are you talking about?

42:59.483 --> 43:01.850
- I'm the gardener of love, Kat.
- Heh.

43:01.852 --> 43:03.785
So, I really need you
to go to that gala

43:03.787 --> 43:05.322
and get you that man.

43:06.923 --> 43:08.323
Deirdre would never
let me go.

43:08.325 --> 43:11.358
- Don't tell her.
- I have nothing to wear.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.894
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

43:12.896 --> 43:14.863
- What are you doing?
- I'm just moving some coffee.

43:14.865 --> 43:17.466
Okay.
You could not have bought the green dress.

43:17.468 --> 43:18.966
It costs like a fortune.

43:18.968 --> 43:20.438
I didn't buy it.

43:24.242 --> 43:25.508
I made it.

43:29.180 --> 43:32.113
No. No.
No crying.

43:32.115 --> 43:33.682
You're gonna make me
start crying. Stop.

43:33.684 --> 43:35.983
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

43:35.985 --> 43:37.818
- I love you.
- I love you!

43:37.820 --> 43:39.320
You're gonna look
so good in it.

43:40.590 --> 43:43.091
'Ho, ho, ho, it's time to go.'

43:43.093 --> 43:45.327
'Santa Land is now closed.'

43:45.329 --> 43:47.997
'But Santa and his elves
will be back tomorrow'

43:47.999 --> 43:50.134
'for more Christmas cheers.'

43:56.472 --> 43:59.441
- You haven't talked much.
- Who are you going with today?

43:59.443 --> 44:01.041
Are you okay?

44:01.043 --> 44:02.676
The fact we almost kissed.

44:06.215 --> 44:08.050
Are you really gonna
make me wait two more days

44:08.052 --> 44:09.718
until I see you
in your human form?

44:09.720 --> 44:11.120
I am.

44:11.122 --> 44:13.854
Wow.
You are one mean elf.

44:31.275 --> 44:33.073
'Living on the edge, huh?'

44:38.381 --> 44:41.649
So, how would your
girlfriend feel

44:41.651 --> 44:43.619
'about our almost kiss?'

44:43.621 --> 44:45.486
Girlfriend?

44:45.488 --> 44:47.789
Come on.
You're Dominic Wintergarden.

44:47.791 --> 44:50.658
Everyone knows you have, like,
a bunch of Insta-girlfirends.

44:51.961 --> 44:54.229
- "Insta-girlfirends?"
- 'Yeah.'

44:54.231 --> 44:57.298
Wow! Is that what people think?

44:57.300 --> 44:59.533
People are pretty quick
to judge.

44:59.535 --> 45:01.169
They always think
they know who I'm dating

45:01.171 --> 45:03.238
who I'm friends with.

45:03.240 --> 45:06.177
I don't even know
who I'm friends anymore.

45:07.510 --> 45:08.646
That's tough.

45:09.813 --> 45:11.048
I, um..

45:12.182 --> 45:14.182
I guess I'm lucky
to have Isla.

45:14.184 --> 45:16.751
Yeah. We should all
hang out together.

Yeah, we should.

Bruno, there' my boy.

48:36.218 --> 48:37.885
I had an amazing
day today, Bruno.

48:46.662 --> 48:49.030
I need some place
to hide this.

48:49.032 --> 48:50.500
Some place safe.

48:54.271 --> 48:56.537
You're such a smart dog.

48:56.539 --> 48:59.374
They would never think
to look anywhere near your bed.

48:59.376 --> 49:00.878
Good boy.

49:06.182 --> 49:07.351
Good boy.

49:07.916 --> 49:09.082
Good boy.

49:21.564 --> 49:23.267
Good morning, Bruno.

49:28.171 --> 49:29.340
Bruno?

49:30.173 --> 49:31.872
Bruno?

49:31.874 --> 49:35.109
Bruno, come on. Tsk-tsk.
Bruno, where are you?

49:35.111 --> 49:37.111
'You've been lying to
us, Katherine'

49:37.113 --> 49:39.948
Hi.
Oh, you scared me.

49:39.950 --> 49:42.117
Why are you holding Bruno?

49:42.119 --> 49:43.984
And why are you up so early?

49:45.322 --> 49:46.921
You've upset mother.

49:48.425 --> 49:51.559
Hi. Did you guys choreograph
this or something?

49:51.561 --> 49:52.959
Seriously, why is everyone
dressed up?

49:52.961 --> 49:55.095
So unfortunate really.

49:55.097 --> 49:57.698
Just as we
were becoming friends.

49:57.700 --> 50:00.135
What are you talking about?

50:00.137 --> 50:03.338
- Can you give me my dog?
- First things first.

50:03.340 --> 50:05.640
Joy, we're ready.

50:05.642 --> 50:08.376
Oh, Kat..

50:08.378 --> 50:09.611
...I love it.

50:09.613 --> 50:12.981
Such a thoughtful gift.

50:12.983 --> 50:15.216
I mean, it's a little plain
but I can fix that.

50:15.218 --> 50:19.320
I think I'm going to name
my next vlog after you.

50:19.322 --> 50:21.057
"The Joy of Christmas Giving."

50:23.059 --> 50:25.227
That's my dress.

50:25.229 --> 50:26.660
You have no right.

50:26.662 --> 50:29.164
Whine and cry.
Whine and cry.

50:29.166 --> 50:31.733
Not really
the holiday spirit, is it?

50:31.735 --> 50:34.301
'Girls, can you excuse us?'

50:34.303 --> 50:36.606
I need to talk
to your stepsister.

50:39.543 --> 50:41.475
I'm still waiting for my gift.

50:46.115 --> 50:47.985
I don't like being lied to.

50:51.488 --> 50:52.956
That's my ticket.

50:54.023 --> 50:55.923
Can.. Can I have it back?

50:55.925 --> 50:58.693
Wait. Please, uh,
it was given to me.

50:58.695 --> 51:00.428
Was it or did you steal it?

51:00.430 --> 51:02.997
No.
Look, I'm sorry.

51:02.999 --> 51:05.033
It was wrong of me,
I should have told you.

51:05.035 --> 51:06.700
Don't, please.

51:06.702 --> 51:08.903
How does it hurt you
if I go to the gala?

51:08.905 --> 51:11.972
You've hurt us by lying
and being deceitful

51:11.974 --> 51:14.943
I know,
I-I'm-I'm so sorry, Deirdre.

51:14.945 --> 51:17.878
But, please,
I never ask for anything.

51:17.880 --> 51:20.048
- 'I want to go to the gala.'
- Oh, I'm sure you do.

51:20.050 --> 51:21.515
But if you care
about your inheritance

51:21.517 --> 51:23.885
you'll do exactly as I say.

51:23.887 --> 51:25.954
It's all so silly really.

51:25.956 --> 51:27.988
Did you think that
the Wintergardens would want you

51:27.990 --> 51:29.624
at their gala. Heh-heh.

51:29.626 --> 51:34.695
Look at you, all that earnest
scribbling in your notebook.

51:34.697 --> 51:36.997
You're nothing but a dreamer.

51:36.999 --> 51:39.035
Just like your father.

51:42.505 --> 51:44.541
Those dishes won't clean
themselves.

52:02.592 --> 52:04.158
- Hey.
- 'Good morning.'

52:04.160 --> 52:07.128
Warm up that voice, you have
a holiday groom to get to.

52:07.130 --> 52:08.463
I wasn't on the schedule.

52:08.465 --> 52:09.865
'Don't worry.
I covered you at work.'

52:09.867 --> 52:12.767
'Hey, hold on
to that pole, please.'

52:12.769 --> 52:14.702
Isla, I need to tell you
something.

52:14.704 --> 52:16.872
I have to tell you something.

52:16.874 --> 52:19.908
It's at the Wintergarden estate.

52:19.910 --> 52:22.776
- 'Guys, hands to yourselves.'
- What?

52:22.778 --> 52:24.278
Why would Dominic do that?

52:24.280 --> 52:25.879
Because he's obsessed with you

52:25.881 --> 52:28.749
and can't get enough
of your cute little elf ears.

52:28.751 --> 52:31.119
'Hey, you're gonna be fine.'

52:31.121 --> 52:33.387
'Plus, he probably just wants
to hang out.'

52:33.389 --> 52:35.289
But if he does
want you to sing

52:35.291 --> 52:36.724
you should do that
Christmas song you've been

52:36.726 --> 52:38.024
working on
'cause it's amazing.

52:38.026 --> 52:40.195
'You know the one
you sent me last week.'

52:40.197 --> 52:41.528
It's just..

52:41.530 --> 52:43.999
My steps just did
something awful.

52:44.001 --> 52:46.937
Tell me about it later.
You're due at the estate in 20.

52:51.974 --> 52:55.175
♪ Sunday to Sunday
now you're taking.. ♪♪

52:55.177 --> 52:57.812
So,
let-let me get this straight..

52:57.814 --> 53:00.682
You're into this Santa Land girl
who you've never met.

53:00.684 --> 53:02.450
Even though Skyler

53:02.452 --> 53:04.619
'who can have anyone
she wants..'

53:04.621 --> 53:07.220
- 'Anyone, dude.'
- 'Is obsessed with you.'

53:07.222 --> 53:08.888
Yeah, that's right.

53:08.890 --> 53:11.059
- Is she at least hot?
- Look, that's not the point.

53:11.061 --> 53:13.894
Alright? I like her.
She's funny, she's smart she's...

53:13.896 --> 53:17.097
She's a dog, isn't she?
What does he look like?

53:17.099 --> 53:18.867
Uh, dude, he said,
it's not the point.

53:18.869 --> 53:21.401
But, no, for real though,
w-what does she looks like?

53:21.403 --> 53:23.437
I don't know.

53:23.439 --> 53:26.740
Like a sort of adorable
little elf.

53:26.742 --> 53:28.309
You're freaking me out, man.

53:28.311 --> 53:30.410
And she's got one of the best
voices I've ever heard.

53:30.412 --> 53:31.445
Yeah.

53:31.447 --> 53:33.448
Well, you'd know, Simon Cowell.

53:34.851 --> 53:37.488
Okay, guys, she's here.

53:38.320 --> 53:39.854
Don't be jerks, okay?

53:39.856 --> 53:42.055
We'll be on our best behavior.

53:42.057 --> 53:45.358
Guys, I'm serious.
Do not mess this up for me.

53:45.360 --> 53:48.896
- Bring on the singer now.
- You're so mature, Noah.

53:48.898 --> 53:51.631
Oh, are you jealous
of the singing elves gal?

53:51.633 --> 53:53.566
- Heh.
- Yo, she so jealous.

53:57.407 --> 53:58.909
- Hi
- Hi.

54:00.276 --> 54:03.611
- Ho, ho, ho, holiday Gram.
- He-he-he.

54:03.613 --> 54:05.515
You are amazing.

54:07.284 --> 54:08.682
What are we doing here?

54:08.684 --> 54:11.551
I mean, did you hire me
for a singing gram.

54:11.553 --> 54:13.120
Yeah, I did.

54:13.122 --> 54:15.622
I want you to come over and
I didn't know if you would, so..

54:15.624 --> 54:17.392
Oh, so you're,
you're stalking me.

54:17.394 --> 54:19.129
Come in.

54:23.133 --> 54:25.767
Wow, you really take
Mr. McJesus costumes

54:25.769 --> 54:27.334
little seriously, don't you?

54:27.336 --> 54:29.102
I don't totally. Heh.

54:29.104 --> 54:30.437
Come on.

54:30.439 --> 54:32.305
This is beautiful.

54:32.307 --> 54:33.610
Yeah, thanks.

54:34.811 --> 54:37.410
Hey, I, um, I need
to tell you something

54:37.412 --> 54:38.748
about my invitation.

54:40.316 --> 54:41.318
'Oh.'

54:42.385 --> 54:44.053
Um, you have company.

54:45.655 --> 54:47.421
I wanna introduce you
to my friends.

54:47.423 --> 54:49.222
This is Noah.
This is Jackson.

54:49.224 --> 54:51.658
This is Ashley.
And that's Skyler.

54:51.660 --> 54:54.294
Guys... this is Kat.

54:54.296 --> 54:56.631
- Whaddup?
- Hi.

54:56.633 --> 55:00.066
So are you gonna sing
or something?

55:00.068 --> 55:01.903
- No, she is not here to sing..
- Oh, no.

55:01.905 --> 55:03.803
Oh, why not? Dominic keeps
telling us

55:03.805 --> 55:05.773
how amazing you are.

55:05.775 --> 55:08.343
Um, I think
I should probably go.

55:08.345 --> 55:11.780
Hey, hey, hey. Sky, Sky,
you're scaring her.

55:11.782 --> 55:14.080
Don't be scared, elfy.
I'll sing with you.

55:14.082 --> 55:15.682
Wait, honestly, man,
it's not even funny.

55:15.684 --> 55:17.050
I-I need to get
in character here.

55:17.052 --> 55:18.320
- 'Jackson, stop!'
- 'Give me the hat.'

55:18.322 --> 55:19.988
- Oh, no. Uh, no.
- Do, do you mind?

55:19.990 --> 55:21.588
- No, no, no. Stop.
- 'What the hell happened?'

55:21.590 --> 55:24.524
- What did you do, Jackson?
- 'I didn't even touch her.'

55:24.526 --> 55:26.528
- Are you okay?
- Wait, hold up.

55:26.530 --> 55:27.562
Wait, I know you.

55:27.564 --> 55:30.097
Wait, isn't she a meme?

55:30.099 --> 55:32.700
Yo! The Starbucks girl.
Whaddup, girl?

55:32.702 --> 55:36.370
'It is her.
I'd recognize her if she's anywhere.'

55:36.372 --> 55:37.671
Cover your Prada, everyone?

55:37.673 --> 55:39.474
- Just stop.
- Well, shut up, Jackson!

55:39.476 --> 55:41.642
- You too, Skylar.
- Dude, relax, I'm joking.

55:41.644 --> 55:44.646
- Oh, this ain't good.
- Oh, Ka-Kat!

55:44.648 --> 55:46.613
Why are you like this?

55:46.615 --> 55:49.283
Please, I'm so sorry, alright?
I just wanted you to meet them.

55:49.285 --> 55:51.251
I bet you did.

55:51.253 --> 55:53.820
It must be fun playing
rich people games.

55:53.822 --> 55:56.090
- Humiliating someone like me.
- Kat, no.

55:56.092 --> 55:57.858
- It's not like that.
- 'I bet they loved it.'

55:57.860 --> 55:59.227
Dominic Wintergarden hanging out

55:59.229 --> 56:02.997
with poor little elfy,
and her knock-off shoes.

56:02.999 --> 56:05.233
God, I thought
you liked me.

56:05.235 --> 56:07.135
Wait, what-what-what
are you talking about?

56:07.137 --> 56:09.671
No, I do like you.
I just..

56:09.673 --> 56:11.673
Look, I wanted you
to meet my friends.

56:11.675 --> 56:14.144
Well, I met them.
You can keep them.

56:15.979 --> 56:19.312

57:08.131 --> 57:11.097

57:11.099 --> 57:14.234
I don't know.
Whatever you think.

57:14.236 --> 57:15.903
What's going on?

57:15.905 --> 57:18.872
You're not looking forward
to t-tomorrow.

57:18.874 --> 57:21.041
Yeah. Sure.

57:21.043 --> 57:22.675
Alright, come on, talk to me.

57:25.414 --> 57:26.914
Dad, I messed up.

57:26.916 --> 57:29.483
- It's a girl.
- I think it's the girl.

57:29.485 --> 57:30.818
It's the one you work with,
isn't it?

57:30.820 --> 57:33.090
Dad, she's amazing.

57:34.423 --> 57:37.658
- What's that you got?
- Oh, um..

57:37.660 --> 57:39.794
This is her song writing book.

57:39.796 --> 57:43.396
She, uh, left it
when she ran out today.

57:43.398 --> 57:46.233
She is the most
talented person I've ever met.

57:46.235 --> 57:48.001
She's smart, she's gorgeous.

57:48.003 --> 57:50.204
And, dad, she liked me

57:50.206 --> 57:53.341
before she knew
I was a Wintergarden.

57:53.343 --> 57:54.941
I totally blew it.

57:54.943 --> 57:57.577
You know what?
I don't buy that.

57:57.579 --> 57:59.879
Whatever happened,
we can fix it.

57:59.881 --> 58:02.184
I don't think
even you can fix this one.

58:10.626 --> 58:11.992
Voila!

58:11.994 --> 58:13.995
It's like a week in Ibiza.

58:13.997 --> 58:16.263
You look like
an Oompa Loompa.

58:16.265 --> 58:18.999
Ugh. Where's that horrible
snow globe?

58:19.001 --> 58:21.371
- It's in my bag.
- Don't forget it.

58:22.204 --> 58:24.305
Ugh.

58:24.307 --> 58:26.207
- Give me this.
- No. I had it first.

58:26.209 --> 58:27.541
It doesn't matter what you wear.

58:27.543 --> 58:29.108
No one's gonna be looking
at you anyway.

58:29.110 --> 58:30.510
- Don't step on..
- It's mine.

58:30.512 --> 58:32.280
You have to earn tiaras.

58:32.282 --> 58:34.782
Well, look who decided
to show up.

58:34.784 --> 58:36.783
You know some of us have
a gala to attend?

58:36.785 --> 58:39.322
Mom, that's my accent!

58:41.858 --> 58:43.358
You need to put
all that away.

58:43.360 --> 58:46.260
I don't want you tainting us
with your bad energy.

58:46.262 --> 58:48.965
- How can I help you?
- Zipper my dress.

58:50.332 --> 58:51.802
'I'm waiting.'

58:55.539 --> 58:57.872
Um, it's not really working

58:57.874 --> 58:59.439
because of all the stuff
you added.

58:59.441 --> 59:00.807
- 'Forget it, we need to go.'
- Make it work.

59:00.809 --> 59:02.477
Kat, have fun tonight.

59:02.479 --> 59:04.379
I've left you a list
of a few things to do.

59:04.381 --> 59:07.013
The living room, the laundry,
the dishes, the bathroom...

59:07.015 --> 59:09.483
Grace, get the tickets,
I almost forgot.

59:09.485 --> 59:12.084
'You can finish the Chinese food
from last week.'

59:12.086 --> 59:14.088
Enjoy little you time.

59:14.090 --> 59:15.555
- Oh, my bag.
- I got it.

59:15.557 --> 59:16.957
It's okay.

59:19.294 --> 59:21.562
- That's my snow globe.
- No, it isn't.

59:21.564 --> 59:24.064
- Yes, it is.
- No.

59:24.066 --> 59:25.566
You stole it from my room?

59:25.568 --> 59:29.137
Now, Katherine, your sister
was just admiring it.

59:29.139 --> 59:30.771
Why would you take it?

59:30.773 --> 59:34.975
You guys all knew how crazy
I was going looking for it.

59:34.977 --> 59:36.943
You lied to me.

59:36.945 --> 59:39.245
- Give it back.
- No! No! Stop it! Ow!

59:39.247 --> 59:42.383
Why the Grinch.
An ugly mean little Grinch.

59:42.385 --> 59:44.419
- Ow, I just wanted to see it!
- Give it to me!

59:45.454 --> 59:47.521
All of this for
a worthless trinket.

59:47.523 --> 59:49.689
- Stop it!
- It's not worthless to me.

59:49.691 --> 59:50.925
No!

59:55.030 --> 59:57.566
All because you couldn't share.

01:00:00.637 --> 01:00:01.905
Clean it up.

01:00:04.807 --> 01:00:06.610
Now it is worthless.

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:23.659
Oh, dad.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.162
What am I supposed to do?

01:00:31.834 --> 01:00:33.566
Hi.

01:00:33.568 --> 01:00:36.405
Bruno, it's been
a really bad day.

01:00:40.142 --> 01:00:41.441
Bruno, what is it?

01:00:45.514 --> 01:00:47.316
Bruno? What is this?

01:00:51.086 --> 01:00:53.555
"Deirdre and Katherine Decker."

01:00:59.561 --> 01:01:03.232
"I look forward to seeing
the two of you at the gala."

01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:09.570
You know what, Bruno?

01:01:09.572 --> 01:01:11.905
They can take my money.

01:01:11.907 --> 01:01:13.140
They can take my time

01:01:13.142 --> 01:01:15.445
they can even take
my green dress.

01:01:18.014 --> 01:01:20.150
But they can't take my name.

01:01:22.619 --> 01:01:23.850
Come on, Bruno.

01:01:23.852 --> 01:01:25.655
We've got a gala to go to.

01:01:35.865 --> 01:01:37.698
Pull it together, girls.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.336
We deserve this.

01:01:41.805 --> 01:01:45.204
- Well... I deserve this.
- Mother.

01:01:45.206 --> 01:01:47.173
I absolutely
must find Dominic.

01:01:47.175 --> 01:01:48.541
There's no accent, Joy.

01:01:48.543 --> 01:01:50.878
And we must find
Mr. Wintergarden.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.312
Oh, I found him.

01:01:52.314 --> 01:01:54.113
Oh, hello, Mr. Wintergarden

01:01:54.115 --> 01:01:56.050
I'm charming to meet you.

01:01:56.052 --> 01:01:57.818
Mom, I get to do the accent.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.421
Trust me, Wintergarden
won't be wearing a scarf.

01:02:00.423 --> 01:02:02.559
And nobody's doing an accent.

01:02:04.793 --> 01:02:07.827
- Isla, are you sure?
- It's the perfect plan.

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:10.231
Come on, I'll just walk you in
with the performers

01:02:10.233 --> 01:02:11.999
then you head into the party
and find Dominic

01:02:12.001 --> 01:02:13.300
and Mr. Wintergarden.

01:02:13.302 --> 01:02:14.800
Clear your name,
arrest the steps

01:02:14.802 --> 01:02:16.436
for impersonating you

01:02:16.438 --> 01:02:19.273
and then we all have ourselves
a merry old Christmas.

01:02:19.275 --> 01:02:21.943
Yeah, you make it sound
so easy.

01:02:21.945 --> 01:02:23.410
And why am I
in my elf gear?

01:02:23.412 --> 01:02:24.845
Isn't that gonna
make me stand out?

01:02:24.847 --> 01:02:27.517
Ah, I don't think you need
to worry about standing out.

01:02:29.651 --> 01:02:31.818
- Heh-heh. Yeah.
- Oh!

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.653
Charming to meet you.

01:02:33.655 --> 01:02:35.655
Charming to meet you.

01:02:35.657 --> 01:02:38.024
Oh, is that shrimp?

01:02:38.026 --> 01:02:40.528
- Oh, mom.
- Huh!

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:41.963
There he is.

01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:43.262
'Claws out, pussy cats.'

01:02:43.264 --> 01:02:44.965
Time to go for the kill.

01:02:44.967 --> 01:02:46.267
Oh!

01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:48.068
I would recognize you anywhere

01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:50.704
my dear, dear
Mr. Wintergarden.

01:02:50.706 --> 01:02:53.506
But I guess
you wouldn't recognize me.

01:02:53.508 --> 01:02:55.075
I'm sorry.
Do we know each other?

01:02:55.077 --> 01:02:57.376
Well, you could say
we're family.

01:02:57.378 --> 01:02:59.278
- Uh, yeah.
- Charming.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.182
I'm charming to meet you.

01:03:01.184 --> 01:03:04.952
No, I'm charming to meet you.

01:03:04.954 --> 01:03:08.254
I-I'm sorry I don't follow,
are you friends of Dominic's?

01:03:08.256 --> 01:03:09.557
Well, if I were naughty

01:03:09.559 --> 01:03:13.359
I'd say I'm his future
mother-in-law.

01:03:13.361 --> 01:03:15.896
- Don't be wicked, mother.
- Or rather.

01:03:15.898 --> 01:03:18.432
You know what,
perhaps you could start again.

01:03:18.434 --> 01:03:20.867
- I'm Terrence Wintergarden.
- It's Deirdre.

01:03:20.869 --> 01:03:24.470
- Deirdre Decker, Jason's widow.
- Oh, for God's sake.

01:03:24.472 --> 01:03:27.307
And I think you might remember
this gorgeous girl, Terry.

01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:29.676
May I call you Terry?
This is Katherine.

01:03:29.678 --> 01:03:33.314
- Jason's beautiful daughter.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:33.316 --> 01:03:36.550
I'm so sorry, I really didn't
recognize you. Look at you.

01:03:36.552 --> 01:03:40.153
You, you're so tall and,
and you've got red hair.

01:03:40.155 --> 01:03:41.921
We can dye it brown.

01:03:41.923 --> 01:03:43.657
Uh, weren't your eyes brown?

01:03:43.659 --> 01:03:45.925
Uh, contacts, teenagers
these days always wanting

01:03:45.927 --> 01:03:48.629
to change their looks.

01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:50.131
Don't suppose
you recognize me?

01:03:50.133 --> 01:03:52.064
- I do.
- No, you don't.

01:03:52.066 --> 01:03:53.566
No, dear, you don't.

01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:55.535
Uh, this is Grace,
my youngest.

01:03:55.537 --> 01:03:57.405
Very nice to meet you, Grace.

01:03:57.407 --> 01:03:59.773
I'm charming, Your Highness.

01:03:59.775 --> 01:04:03.176
Y-Yes, you are charming,
and I'm not a Highness.

01:04:03.178 --> 01:04:05.345
But, Katherine, please,
tell me everything.

01:04:05.347 --> 01:04:08.082
Uh, I have so many fond memories
of you and your father.

01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:10.350
Do you remember
any of those times?

01:04:10.352 --> 01:04:12.354
Mm-hm.

01:04:13.756 --> 01:04:17.390
Uh, Kat, honey, why don't you
tell Mr. Wintergarden

01:04:17.392 --> 01:04:21.128
all the facts about daddy
that you love?

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:24.832
- Mm-hm?
- Right. Right. Right.

01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:28.135
- Did you know Jason Decker...
- No, there's no accent, dear.

01:04:28.137 --> 01:04:31.137
We travel so often she sometimes
slips in through an accent.

01:04:31.139 --> 01:04:33.573
Oh, rather.

01:04:33.575 --> 01:04:36.809
- Anyway, did you know Jason...
- Daddy.

01:04:36.811 --> 01:04:38.611
Oh, uh, daddy

01:04:38.613 --> 01:04:40.580
traveled to the Earth's
most remote locations

01:04:40.582 --> 01:04:43.117
to care for people in high risk,
high altitude situations

01:04:43.119 --> 01:04:45.419
'but this American doctor
didn't just save lives.'

01:04:45.421 --> 01:04:47.722
- Decker...
- Daddy.

01:04:47.724 --> 01:04:50.490
Daddy, was also
a keen photographer

01:04:50.492 --> 01:04:52.425
who took a stunning pictures
depicting everything

01:04:52.427 --> 01:04:55.428
from the light,
hitting an Antarctic iceberg

01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:58.332
to the misty Tanzawa
mountain range in Japan.

01:04:58.334 --> 01:05:01.501
Well, you know your facts.

01:05:01.503 --> 01:05:03.336
I suppose you
miss him terribly?

01:05:03.338 --> 01:05:06.205
- Yes.
- Mm.

01:05:06.207 --> 01:05:09.142
Oh?
Yes, dad, yes.

01:05:09.144 --> 01:05:10.912
I miss him.
Yes.

01:05:10.914 --> 01:05:12.613
Mm-hm.

01:05:12.615 --> 01:05:14.048
Also in addition to exploring

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:16.149
some of the harshest topography
in the world

01:05:16.151 --> 01:05:18.251
Dec-daddy, yes, I know, daddy

01:05:18.253 --> 01:05:20.019
was also credited
with helping shift

01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:23.090
the Animal Rights movement
to a more utilitarian focus

01:05:23.092 --> 01:05:24.758
including a focus
on chicken.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.994
- That's enough, dear. Please.
- Chicken..

01:05:26.996 --> 01:05:29.829
Please, Terry, continue.

01:05:29.831 --> 01:05:32.466
Uh, I, um..

01:05:32.468 --> 01:05:34.100
I just want to say that I, uh

01:05:34.102 --> 01:05:35.869
I became very close
with your father.

01:05:35.871 --> 01:05:37.437
As he did with you.

01:05:37.439 --> 01:05:39.573
And-and you know, it breaks
my heart when I heard that..

01:05:39.575 --> 01:05:41.140
- I..
- Oh, shut up. It's Dominic.

01:05:41.142 --> 01:05:42.575
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, Nick.

01:05:42.577 --> 01:05:43.776
- What's up, Mr. T?
- Hey, Noah.

01:05:43.778 --> 01:05:45.412
Nick, this is, uh,
Mrs. Decker.

01:05:45.414 --> 01:05:47.013
- Deirdre.
- Deirdre.

01:05:47.015 --> 01:05:48.615
Uh, that's Jason's wife

01:05:48.617 --> 01:05:51.251
and her daughters,
Grace and Katherine.

01:05:51.253 --> 01:05:53.019
Call me Kat.

01:05:53.021 --> 01:05:55.622
Wow, you're the second Kat
I've met this month.

01:05:55.624 --> 01:05:57.457
I actually invited
my Kat tonight

01:05:57.459 --> 01:06:00.026
but I don't think
that is happening.

01:06:00.028 --> 01:06:02.062
So now we're backstage,
when the performers go on

01:06:02.064 --> 01:06:04.231
you follow one of the waiters
into the party.

01:06:04.233 --> 01:06:06.332
- Easy-peasy.
- Yeah. Piece of cake.

01:06:06.334 --> 01:06:08.602
- Mm-hm. Come on.
- Oh, God.

01:06:08.604 --> 01:06:10.704
I don't know if you remember,
but you played together

01:06:10.706 --> 01:06:12.573
when you're
four or five years old?

01:06:12.575 --> 01:06:14.774
You know I, I think I remember
playing doctor with you

01:06:14.776 --> 01:06:17.510
maybe we should
play that game again.

01:06:17.512 --> 01:06:19.379
- No, I'm not sick.
- I am.

01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:23.450
Got a, got a little
somethin'-somethin'.

01:06:23.452 --> 01:06:25.588
I'll make an appointment,
doctor.

01:06:31.327 --> 01:06:33.626
Whoo! Hold up.
Uh, who are you?

01:06:33.628 --> 01:06:36.796
- Um, I'm a singer.
- Look, she's late.

01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:39.468
- It's who she is.
- Uh, what? Right now?

01:06:41.236 --> 01:06:43.039
- Okay. Follow them.
- Okay.

01:06:44.472 --> 01:06:47.407
- Hey!
- Mm.

01:06:47.409 --> 01:06:48.941
'Where do you think
you're going?'

01:06:48.943 --> 01:06:50.744
I have to go talk
to Mr. Wintergarden.

01:06:50.746 --> 01:06:52.479
Well, there's no performers
allowed out front.

01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:54.613
And I don't have my ears.

01:06:54.615 --> 01:06:57.149
Get ears!
I need ears here now.

01:06:57.151 --> 01:06:59.954
But do it on stage
because we are ready to go.

01:06:59.956 --> 01:07:03.923
You sure we've never met?
'Cause you look so familiar.

01:07:03.925 --> 01:07:07.260
Oh, no, but giant pandas

01:07:07.262 --> 01:07:09.129
are an extinct species.

01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:12.198
Um, dung beetles are not, they
eat the feces of other animal..

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.568
Another fascinating
tit-bit she learned from daddy.

01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:16.503
Oh, isn't the show
about to start?

01:07:16.505 --> 01:07:17.974
Uh, everyone?

01:07:20.876 --> 01:07:22.843
'One minute to curtain!'

01:07:22.845 --> 01:07:24.611
You-you have to
get me out of here.

01:07:24.613 --> 01:07:25.678
I can't be on that stage
when the curtain goes up.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.046
I don't know what I'm doing

01:07:27.048 --> 01:07:28.548
and if the steps see me
it'll all be over.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:29.682
Okay, okay, just follow me,
follow me.

01:07:29.684 --> 01:07:32.551
- Um..
- No. No, no.

01:07:32.553 --> 01:07:35.155
All elves start onstage.

01:07:35.157 --> 01:07:37.624
Sorry, onstage. Go.

01:07:37.626 --> 01:07:40.630
- I'm sorry.
- Curtain's up in 10 seconds!

01:07:44.566 --> 01:07:46.702
Uh, sorry, sorry.

01:08:32.814 --> 01:08:33.950
Ah!

01:08:36.451 --> 01:08:38.587
Oh, sorry. Oh!

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:42.957
- Mom, isn't that Kat?
- You stay here.

01:08:42.959 --> 01:08:44.925
Keep them occupied.
Do not let them leave.

01:08:44.926 --> 01:08:47.063
Forgive me, Terry,
I have to tinkle.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.934
Look at us,
just one big happy family, hm?

01:08:53.935 --> 01:08:56.535
Dad, I gotta go do something.
I'll catch you later.

01:08:56.537 --> 01:08:58.372
Wha.. Dominic, wait!
No, uh, wait.

01:08:58.374 --> 01:09:00.175
Dominic, I'm coming.

01:09:05.113 --> 01:09:06.115
Ah!

01:09:10.384 --> 01:09:11.586
Oh!

01:09:23.064 --> 01:09:24.698
There you are.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.099
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.368
- Skylar, I'll catch you later.
- What's your hurry?

01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:30.435
I think I saw some
mistletoe around here.

01:09:30.438 --> 01:09:33.372
Yeah? Hey, Jackson,
you just go find it.

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:35.475
Is this about
that little elf girl?

01:09:35.478 --> 01:09:37.408
You can't be serious, Nicky.

01:09:37.411 --> 01:09:38.743
She's an elf.

01:09:38.746 --> 01:09:40.613
She's nowhere near my league.

01:09:40.616 --> 01:09:43.015
You're right, she's not.

01:09:43.018 --> 01:09:46.154
But Skylar,
you can always dream.

01:09:55.964 --> 01:09:58.164
- What are you doing?
- I-I'm losing my grip.

01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:00.467
Don't let go.

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:12.511
Oh, I am so, so sorry.

01:10:12.513 --> 01:10:15.649
You're right,
I-I've done enough. Oh!

01:10:15.651 --> 01:10:17.717
That was terrible.
Oh, it was really bad.

01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:19.752
- It was really bad, wasn't it?
- You were fine.

01:10:19.754 --> 01:10:21.454
But did you see
what your stepsister

01:10:21.456 --> 01:10:23.023
did to my dress?

01:10:23.025 --> 01:10:23.824
She's an animal.

01:10:23.826 --> 01:10:27.261
Okay, I need to get out of here.

01:10:27.263 --> 01:10:28.895
Stop, right now.

01:10:28.897 --> 01:10:30.196
You are gonna go on
for the Snow Queen.

01:10:30.198 --> 01:10:32.097
What? Uh, why me?

01:10:32.099 --> 01:10:34.400
Well, because the original
Snow Queen is unconscious

01:10:34.402 --> 01:10:36.102
and you made her that way.

01:10:36.104 --> 01:10:40.306
Oh, that's very bad.
I'm so, so sorry.

01:10:40.308 --> 01:10:42.242
You're a singer, right?

01:10:42.244 --> 01:10:45.546
Oh, I, I can't. I..

01:10:45.548 --> 01:10:47.247
I won't be able
to fit into the costume.

01:10:47.249 --> 01:10:49.050
I have something for you.

01:10:51.018 --> 01:10:53.620
I made it after you told me
what the steps did

01:10:53.622 --> 01:10:54.922
and it's gonna
make that green dress

01:10:54.924 --> 01:10:56.190
look like a dish towel.

01:10:56.192 --> 01:10:58.124
Isla, this is insane.

01:10:58.126 --> 01:11:01.261
No, this is
your Christmas miracle.

01:11:01.263 --> 01:11:02.930
You got this, Kat.

01:11:02.932 --> 01:11:05.766
Your music deserves
to be heard.

01:11:05.768 --> 01:11:07.066
- She's gonna do it.
- Great.

01:11:07.068 --> 01:11:09.203
- We need a dresser here!
- Uh, um..

01:11:09.205 --> 01:11:10.703
No, no, no.

01:11:10.705 --> 01:11:12.471
Just like a holiday grim.

01:11:12.473 --> 01:11:14.641
Just like you're singing
to a family.

01:11:14.643 --> 01:11:16.110
A family of hundreds
of people.

01:11:16.112 --> 01:11:18.477
- Isla!
- I'll give 'em your track.

01:11:20.883 --> 01:11:22.748
Oh, ma'am, sorry,
authorized personnel only.

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:24.818
I'm a VIP.
Where are you, Kat?

01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:26.252
I know you're in here somewhere.

01:11:26.254 --> 01:11:27.620
Aren't you little old
to be an elf?

01:11:27.622 --> 01:11:29.088
- Come on out.
- Hey!

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:31.123
- I'll destroy you.
- What are you doing here?

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:34.093
Oh, I'm a patron of the arts.
I just, I saw an elf...

01:11:34.095 --> 01:11:35.596
Excuse me.

01:11:35.598 --> 01:11:37.062
I don't think so.

01:11:37.064 --> 01:11:39.168
Don't you know who I am?
Dominic!

01:11:41.036 --> 01:11:42.038
Kat?

01:11:50.045 --> 01:11:51.147
Wow!

01:11:56.351 --> 01:11:57.987
It's you.

01:12:00.321 --> 01:12:01.957
It's me.

01:12:04.026 --> 01:12:06.059
You made it.

01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:07.360
You did too.

01:12:07.362 --> 01:12:09.695
Well, it is my party.

01:12:09.697 --> 01:12:11.364
No, I-I know.

01:12:11.366 --> 01:12:14.267
Um, I just meant..

01:12:14.269 --> 01:12:17.136
I was afraid I was
never gonna see you again.

01:12:17.138 --> 01:12:18.672
I'm so sorry.

01:12:18.674 --> 01:12:20.974
I tried to find you, but I..

01:12:20.976 --> 01:12:22.876
I didn't even
know your last name.

01:12:22.878 --> 01:12:25.311
No, I'm so sorry,
I-I'm so sorry

01:12:25.313 --> 01:12:27.146
I-I ruined your show.

01:12:27.148 --> 01:12:29.682
I wanted to find you and it was
the only way to get in.

01:12:29.684 --> 01:12:32.785
Uh, the ticket
might have been easier.

01:12:32.787 --> 01:12:36.056
I tried to tell you,
my stepmother burned it.

01:12:36.058 --> 01:12:38.492
- What? Who's your stepmother?
- 'Hey!'

01:12:38.494 --> 01:12:41.727
How dare you make a mockery
of Terry's gala?

01:12:41.729 --> 01:12:44.864
- This would be her.
- Get off!

01:12:44.866 --> 01:12:46.600
- Wait..
- I'm so sorry, Dominic.

01:12:46.602 --> 01:12:48.638
- You guys know each other?
- You know this party crasher?

01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:52.940
Hi, mom!

01:12:55.777 --> 01:12:58.511
I hate to interrupt
this little reunion

01:12:58.513 --> 01:13:00.881
but we've got a show to do.

01:13:00.883 --> 01:13:03.850
- I-I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

01:13:03.852 --> 01:13:06.352
You left your songbook
at my house.

01:13:06.354 --> 01:13:07.689
It's..

01:13:08.823 --> 01:13:11.291
Your dad was right.

01:13:11.293 --> 01:13:13.360
You dreamed it..

01:13:13.362 --> 01:13:15.194
...now go be it.

01:13:15.196 --> 01:13:17.029
Uh, Dominic,
I, I hate to disagree...

01:13:17.031 --> 01:13:18.097
Alright, well, don't.

01:13:18.099 --> 01:13:20.534
We'll deal with this later.

01:13:20.536 --> 01:13:21.871
Kat..

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.471
...you got this.

01:13:26.308 --> 01:13:28.244
Alright, people, please.

01:13:29.378 --> 01:13:30.713
Come on.

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:36.682
Hey!

01:13:36.684 --> 01:13:39.618

Thank you.

01:17:09.063 --> 01:17:11.631
I want you to meet someone.

01:17:11.633 --> 01:17:14.667
Dad, this is Kat.

01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:17.035
The girl from Santa Land
I was telling you about.

01:17:17.037 --> 01:17:19.508
Kay, you were remarkable.

01:17:20.674 --> 01:17:21.975
Hey, Kat.

01:17:21.977 --> 01:17:24.776
Right, uh, Kat this is Kat.

01:17:24.778 --> 01:17:27.980
That's so weird.
Isn't that weird, mom?

01:17:27.982 --> 01:17:30.816
Her name isn't Kat, it's Joy.

01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:32.785
She's my stepsister.

01:17:32.787 --> 01:17:34.287
And that's Grace.

01:17:34.289 --> 01:17:37.422
And this is my stepmother,
Deirdre.

01:17:37.424 --> 01:17:40.262
She scammed her way in here
to try to take advantage of you.

01:17:41.996 --> 01:17:44.230
I'm Katherine Decker.

01:17:44.232 --> 01:17:46.365
I hate to do this to you, Joy,
but...

01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:49.069
- What?
- Not you, Katherine. Her.

01:17:49.071 --> 01:17:51.372
Excuse me.
Uh, may I..

01:17:55.343 --> 01:17:57.144
'There's only two these
in the world.'

01:17:57.146 --> 01:17:59.447
- I know.
- I have the other one.

01:18:01.049 --> 01:18:05.885
My father brought it back
from the North Pole.

01:18:05.887 --> 01:18:08.821
He and his friend Terry

01:18:08.823 --> 01:18:11.257
found them on their expedition.

01:18:11.259 --> 01:18:14.095
I'm so sorry that I lost touch
with your father.

01:18:15.897 --> 01:18:18.898
He was a true friend
and an extraordinary man.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.934
You know, he didn't care
about me being a billionaire.

01:18:20.936 --> 01:18:23.072
Is that billion with a 'B?'

01:18:26.273 --> 01:18:29.208
- So, you're Terry?
- And you're Jason's Katherine.

01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:30.842
And there are those
beautiful brown eyes.

01:18:30.844 --> 01:18:32.345
You know, Terry,
I can explain...

01:18:32.347 --> 01:18:34.213
- Please, stop talking.
- No, no. Listen. listen.

01:18:34.215 --> 01:18:36.682
This is just a huge
misunderstanding.

01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:40.086
I was trying to protect
Katherine from any more pain.

01:18:40.088 --> 01:18:42.989
I've spent my life
trying to protect her.

01:18:42.991 --> 01:18:45.461
Mm.
Like you protected her here.

01:18:47.329 --> 01:18:51.765
The joy of kindness walked right
into this humiliating situation.

01:18:51.767 --> 01:18:53.966
- Fake news.
- Shut up, Joy.

01:18:55.269 --> 01:18:58.203
Well, this has been
a lovely reunion.

01:18:58.205 --> 01:19:00.873
But Kat has to get back
to her real life now.

01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:04.011
Her-her father, I'm in charge
of her inheritance.

01:19:04.013 --> 01:19:06.745
And, well,
Kat had so many expenses.

01:19:06.747 --> 01:19:09.216
So you see..

01:19:09.218 --> 01:19:12.054
...there's nothing left
for you to inherit.

01:19:16.223 --> 01:19:18.423
I guess it's a good thing
I'm a billionaire.

01:19:18.425 --> 01:19:23.029
And that is billion
with a 'B.'

01:19:23.031 --> 01:19:24.597
You know, Kat,
I can't guarantee that

01:19:24.599 --> 01:19:25.797
you're gonna be
a famous songwriter

01:19:25.799 --> 01:19:27.167
but I can guarantee that

01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:29.202
you'll have a chance
to chase your dreams.

01:19:29.204 --> 01:19:30.502
Don't worry about
expenses anymore.

01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:32.872
It's the least I can do
for your dad.

01:19:32.874 --> 01:19:34.806
First of all,
I think you're gonna need

01:19:34.808 --> 01:19:36.376
an apartment for yourself.

01:19:36.378 --> 01:19:38.380
Lord knows you're
gonna wanna move.

01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:44.182
- I-I don't know what to say.
- Say yes. Um-hm.

01:19:44.184 --> 01:19:47.185
Um, yes, yes, yes.

01:19:47.187 --> 01:19:49.254
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:19:49.256 --> 01:19:51.056
- And Deirdre?
- Yes, Terry..

01:19:51.058 --> 01:19:52.691
Mr. Wintergarden, s-sir.

01:19:52.693 --> 01:19:54.927
I think it's time
for you and your girls

01:19:54.929 --> 01:19:56.895
'Grace and Joy, is it?'

01:19:56.897 --> 01:20:00.199
- My name is Katherine Decker.
- Oh, shut up, Joy.

01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:01.834
I think it's time you leave.

01:20:01.836 --> 01:20:04.604
- Scott?
- Yes, sir.

01:20:04.606 --> 01:20:07.140
Would you please escort
these ladies to the door?

01:20:07.142 --> 01:20:09.042
- With pleasure.
- Thank you so much.

01:20:09.044 --> 01:20:10.446
Charmed, Your Highness.

01:20:12.179 --> 01:20:14.946
'Get your hands off of me.
You'll live to regret this.'

01:20:14.948 --> 01:20:16.748
Oh, hey, what's up, dog?

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:18.450
- Oh!
- Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:20:18.452 --> 01:20:21.354
- This party's beneath me.
- Leaving so soon?

01:20:21.356 --> 01:20:24.623
Kat, I am so sorry
about what happened.

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:27.293
My friends were such jerks
and I didn't do anything

01:20:27.295 --> 01:20:30.297
and I promise that will
never happen again.

01:20:30.299 --> 01:20:34.499
No, I am so sorry.
I completely overreacted.

01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:37.736
I just thought
that someone like you

01:20:37.738 --> 01:20:41.274
might not be interested
in someone like me.

01:20:41.276 --> 01:20:43.242
Someone like you?

01:20:43.244 --> 01:20:46.111
You mean, funny, kind

01:20:46.113 --> 01:20:48.681
talented, gorgeous?

01:20:48.683 --> 01:20:52.418
- Someone like that?
- Yeah.

01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:55.421
Yeah. I'm interested.

01:20:55.423 --> 01:20:58.490
Really, really interested.

01:20:58.492 --> 01:21:01.994
Are you interested?

01:21:01.996 --> 01:21:05.998
Yeah, I'm really interested.

01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:12.504
- "DJ Sockpuppet?"
- "DJ Sockpuppet?"

01:21:12.506 --> 01:21:15.440
- Wait, dad?
- Mm.

01:21:15.442 --> 01:21:18.477
Come on, you didn't think
I knew about your bands?

01:21:18.479 --> 01:21:20.145
Son, you have an excellent ear
for talent.

01:21:20.147 --> 01:21:21.948
You're gonna make
a great manager.

01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:23.749
Wait, how did you..
How did you get them?

01:21:23.751 --> 01:21:25.553
Eh, it's what I do.

01:21:28.589 --> 01:21:30.123
You know what,
I may be distracted

01:21:30.125 --> 01:21:32.525
from time to time..

01:21:32.527 --> 01:21:34.530
...but you'll always come first.

01:21:35.696 --> 01:21:36.831
Come here.

01:21:40.134 --> 01:21:42.636
Go on, go talk
to your girl.

01:21:42.638 --> 01:21:43.906
Thanks, dad.

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:50.709
Oh, and, uh, we have
another family tradition.

01:21:50.711 --> 01:21:52.410
Every year we get
to choose a girl

01:21:52.412 --> 01:21:54.413
to dance with at the gala.

01:21:54.415 --> 01:21:55.851
And rumor has it..

01:21:56.817 --> 01:21:58.885
...they fall in love.

01:21:58.887 --> 01:22:01.820
You just made that up right now,
didn't you?

01:22:01.822 --> 01:22:04.824
Traditions gotta start
somewhere.

01:22:04.826 --> 01:22:07.226
