Hello?

00:58.318 --> 01:01.370
Hi, honey. It's me.

01:01.405 --> 01:03.407
I went to see the doctor today,

01:03.907 --> 01:06.410
'Cause ever since you've been gone,

01:06.445 --> 01:09.878
I had a pain deep down inside.

01:09.913 --> 01:12.916
He says there's nothing
really wrong with me.

01:12.951 --> 01:15.436
I'm just missin' my man.

01:15.471 --> 01:17.886
So, honey, please...

01:17.921 --> 01:20.924
come on home as soon as you can.

Of getting in if you come by cab.

01:41.078 --> 01:43.080
You're really worried about getting in?

01:43.115 --> 01:44.046
Yes.

01:44.081 --> 01:46.083
I thought you'd been
here several times before.

01:46.118 --> 01:47.049
Not the front way.

01:47.084 --> 01:48.085
They were private parties.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.051
We came in the back.

01:49.086 --> 01:51.521
We look really good tonight.

01:51.556 --> 01:53.957
I'm sure we're going to get in.

01:57.594 --> 01:59.596
Get back.

02:01.098 --> 02:03.350
Let's get a cab.

02:03.385 --> 02:05.567
Maybe you're right.

02:05.602 --> 02:08.104
When we get out, don't
stop where the crowd is.

02:08.139 --> 02:09.071
Just follow me right in.

02:09.106 --> 02:10.607
When we get out, we just follow you in.

02:11.108 --> 02:11.608
Yeah.

02:12.058 --> 02:14.611
Why don't you put this on?

02:14.646 --> 02:16.113
What?

02:16.613 --> 02:18.064
Just until we get inside.

02:18.148 --> 02:19.616
I don't get it.

02:37.134 --> 02:39.636
We're all together.

02:41.138 --> 02:42.053
Van!

02:42.088 --> 02:43.605
Only him.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.643
We're together. Come on, van.

02:46.678 --> 02:48.412
This is important.

02:48.447 --> 02:50.112
These are my friends.

02:50.147 --> 02:52.899
You can go in, but they'll have to wait.

02:54.151 --> 02:56.603
Hey, nice coat.

03:04.161 --> 03:06.163
Don't worry, Jimmy. We don't care.

03:06.198 --> 03:07.164
I can't believe it.

03:07.664 --> 03:09.131
Yeah, what an asshole.

03:09.166 --> 03:10.167
You know, that had nothing to do

03:10.202 --> 03:11.133
With you guys.

03:11.168 --> 03:12.669
Van just wanted to put me in my place.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.171
Apparently, it happens all the time.

03:14.206 --> 03:15.137
Jerk.

03:15.172 --> 03:16.673
It's happened to you before?

03:16.708 --> 03:18.675
No, but it was overdue.

03:19.176 --> 03:20.677
You know, none of us
really wanted to go anyway.

03:20.712 --> 03:22.196
Yeah, we're exhausted.

03:22.231 --> 03:23.680
No, I really wanted to go.

03:28.185 --> 03:30.152
There's Jimmy Steinway.

03:30.187 --> 03:31.688
I can't believe it...
He's already leaving?

03:31.723 --> 03:34.156
You like him?

03:34.191 --> 03:36.193
I could never be interested in anyone

03:36.228 --> 03:37.694
Who worked in advertising.

03:39.196 --> 03:41.163
God. You were right.

03:41.198 --> 03:45.202

really hard to get into.

It's not what you think.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.765
I'm...

05:23.800 --> 05:25.302
I think I'm gay.

05:25.337 --> 05:28.770
What?

05:28.805 --> 05:30.807
That's not possible.

05:32.809 --> 05:33.775
How?

05:33.810 --> 05:35.277
It's always been there, I guess.

05:35.312 --> 05:37.314
I've only begun to acknowledge it now.

05:37.349 --> 05:40.817
You really think you're gay?

05:40.852 --> 05:41.783
Taxi.

05:41.818 --> 05:43.320
I was just starting law school

05:43.355 --> 05:44.286
When the first up-Tempo

05:44.321 --> 05:45.822
Philadelphia international hits broke:

05:45.857 --> 05:47.324
Some people don't
consider that disco...

05:47.359 --> 05:48.325
Because
it's good...

05:48.825 --> 05:51.828
But I remember feeling
absolutely electrified.

05:51.863 --> 05:53.097
You feel electrified often.

05:53.132 --> 05:54.331
No, but this was different.

05:54.831 --> 05:55.797
I loved the idea that there'd be

05:55.832 --> 05:57.334
All these great places
for people to go dancing,

05:57.369 --> 05:59.336
After the terrible social wasteland

05:59.371 --> 06:01.105
Of our college years. Uhff.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.741
You've been to a lot of discos?

06:03.776 --> 06:05.810
No. In fact, practically none.

06:05.845 --> 06:07.809
For me, law school wasn't easy,

06:07.844 --> 06:09.346
And I haven't had much of a social life

06:09.381 --> 06:10.812
Since coming to the city, either.

06:10.847 --> 06:13.350
But I still consider
myself a loyal adherent

06:13.385 --> 06:14.368
To the disco movement.

06:14.403 --> 06:15.352
It's a "movement"?

06:15.387 --> 06:16.353
Sort of.

06:16.603 --> 06:17.854
What I found terribly encouraging

06:18.355 --> 06:19.856
Was the idea that when
the time in life came

06:20.357 --> 06:20.857
To have a social life,

06:21.358 --> 06:22.859
There'd be all these great places

06:22.894 --> 06:23.825
For people to go to,

06:23.860 --> 06:25.111
Because, as you'll remember,

06:25.146 --> 06:26.363
For many years, there were none.

06:26.398 --> 06:27.329
Yeah.

06:27.364 --> 06:28.830
What I didn't realize...

06:28.865 --> 06:31.368
is that it gets so
impossible to get into.

06:31.403 --> 06:33.387
Let's call it a night.

06:33.422 --> 06:35.372
No, wait. I have an idea.

06:35.407 --> 06:36.838
Jimmy.

06:36.873 --> 06:38.875
Here take this. Jimmy!

06:38.910 --> 06:41.378
Take this. Jimmy!

06:44.881 --> 06:45.882
Oh, hi.

06:45.917 --> 06:46.848
Hi.

06:46.883 --> 06:47.884
You're des's friend.

06:47.919 --> 06:49.386
Yeah, hi.

06:52.389 --> 06:54.391
Where are Marshall and Steve?

06:54.426 --> 06:56.393
They've gone back to the hotel.

06:56.428 --> 06:57.894
Jim, come on.

06:58.395 --> 06:58.895
I can't believe it.

06:59.396 --> 07:00.730
Jim, let's go.

07:03.399 --> 07:05.401
They wanted me to apologize for them.

07:05.436 --> 07:06.402
They were really bushed.

07:06.437 --> 07:07.403
What a disaster.

07:07.903 --> 07:08.869
No.

07:08.904 --> 07:10.906

07:24.920 --> 07:26.887
It's not obviously connected, but...

07:26.922 --> 07:28.924
I think that's what made
me a little more tolerant

07:28.959 --> 07:30.426
Of the guys at Hampshire.

07:30.461 --> 07:32.393
What do you mean?

07:32.428 --> 07:34.395
You were a bit critical.

07:34.430 --> 07:36.432
The guys there preferred
women more..."laid-Back."

07:36.932 --> 07:38.899
I'm laid-Back.

07:38.934 --> 07:40.901
For whatever reason,

07:40.936 --> 07:42.938
You didn't have much
of a social life there.

07:42.973 --> 07:44.905
I had a
social life...

07:44.940 --> 07:46.942
Just not one of those
terrible pretend-Marriages.

07:46.977 --> 07:48.444
The Hampshire guys were jerks,

07:48.944 --> 07:50.946
Hippy-Dippy suburbanites
with all this hair...

07:50.981 --> 07:53.216
And extremely dim
intellectual interests.

07:53.251 --> 07:55.451
I'm sorry, I don't
consider the guy who did

07:55.486 --> 07:56.952
The Spiderman comics a serious writer.

07:56.987 --> 07:58.419
Alice, one thing I've noticed

07:58.454 --> 07:59.955
Is that people hate being criticized.

08:00.456 --> 08:01.922
Everyone hates that.

08:01.957 --> 08:03.959
It's one of the great
truths of human nature.

08:04.460 --> 08:06.927
I think it's why my
parents got divorced.

08:06.962 --> 08:08.964
I'm sorry... It's just
that you're so terrific...

08:09.465 --> 08:10.466
It makes me sick to think
that you might get in

08:10.966 --> 08:12.217
That terrible situation again,

08:12.252 --> 08:13.469
Where everyone
hated you...

08:13.504 --> 08:14.935
Hated me?

08:14.970 --> 08:17.438
You're wonderful.

08:17.473 --> 08:20.976
Maybe, in physical terms,
I'm a little cuter than you,

08:21.011 --> 08:23.479
But you should be much
more popular than I am...

08:23.514 --> 08:24.945
it would be such a shame

08:24.980 --> 08:26.982
If what happened in
college repeated itself.

08:27.017 --> 08:29.485
Why would it repeat itself?

08:29.985 --> 08:31.452
You're right.

08:31.487 --> 08:32.453
I just think it's so important

08:32.488 --> 08:34.990
To be in control of
your own destiny...

08:35.025 --> 08:37.457
Not to fall into that fifties cliche

08:37.493 --> 08:39.495
Of waiting by the
phone for guys to call:

08:39.530 --> 08:40.496
The right ones never do.

08:40.996 --> 08:41.962
Those who do,

08:41.996 --> 08:43.999
You have to make the most
ridiculous excuses to:

08:44.034 --> 08:46.001
The nice ones get hurt
feelings and hate you;

08:46.036 --> 08:47.503
The jerks inevitably corner you

08:47.538 --> 08:49.004
Into going out anyway.

08:49.505 --> 08:50.471
Late at night you find yourself

08:50.506 --> 08:52.508
With some awful guy
with disgusting breath,

08:52.543 --> 08:53.776
Thrusting his belly up against you,

08:53.811 --> 08:55.010
Trying to stick his slobbering tongue

08:55.511 --> 08:56.977
In your mouth. Ugh, yecch.

08:57.012 --> 08:59.515
Thank god this is a

08:59.550 --> 09:01.517

Marshall didn't come...

09:18.569 --> 09:21.304

09:21.339 --> 09:24.039
Don't worry about it. So what.

09:24.074 --> 09:25.005
It's so stupid.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.541
I'm sure it's Jimmy.

09:26.576 --> 09:28.043
I think it's much better to wait

09:28.544 --> 09:29.545
Until things happen naturally.

09:30.045 --> 09:31.547
Forcing things never works.

09:31.582 --> 09:32.513
That's not true.

09:32.548 --> 09:35.050
Forcing things usually
works beautifully.

09:35.085 --> 09:37.553
You know, even if he's in advertising,

09:37.588 --> 09:38.554
Someone will want him.

09:39.054 --> 09:40.521
I just think it's so important

09:40.556 --> 09:42.507
That we be in control
of our own destinies.

09:42.542 --> 09:43.776
It doesn't matter.

09:43.811 --> 09:44.975
Marshall's a really good guy.

09:45.010 --> 09:47.012
He doesn't really care
about this kind of stuff.

09:47.047 --> 09:49.031
I can't believe it.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.981
Uh, excuse me...

09:51.016 --> 09:52.517
has anyone ever told
you you look just like

09:53.018 --> 09:54.519
Kate Preston's brother rod?

09:54.554 --> 09:55.986
Who?

09:56.021 --> 09:58.023
Rod Preston. Do you know him?

09:58.058 --> 10:00.025
Uh, no.

10:00.525 --> 10:02.027
Have you ever noticed that
people who look just alike

10:02.062 --> 10:04.029
Never seem to know each other?

10:04.064 --> 10:05.530
Hunh.

10:07.532 --> 10:08.498
Hi.

10:08.533 --> 10:10.910
Hey. How've you been?

10:10.945 --> 10:13.288
Fine. How are you?

10:15.007 --> 10:16.506
He's really depressed.

10:16.541 --> 10:19.043
God, isn't this place great?

10:19.078 --> 10:21.313
It's fantastic! I love it.

10:21.348 --> 10:23.548
I really like this song.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.015
Yeah.

10:25.050 --> 10:27.552
Do you like to dance?

10:27.587 --> 10:29.071
W- W-Would
you?

10:29.106 --> 10:30.331
Sure. Great.

10:30.366 --> 10:31.521
Shall we all go?

10:31.556 --> 10:34.559
I... I think he's
too depressed to dance.

10:34.594 --> 10:36.561
Hey, Jimmy, we're
going to dance... Come on.

10:36.596 --> 10:38.063
I'm too depressed to dance.

10:38.098 --> 10:39.147
Go ahead.

10:46.071 --> 10:47.537
What's wrong?

10:47.572 --> 10:49.574
Absolute disaster.

10:49.609 --> 10:50.540
What?

10:50.575 --> 10:52.327
I had to get some clients into the club,

10:52.362 --> 10:54.079
So I gave the boss
my coat to wear...

10:54.579 --> 10:56.081
"Here, wear this."

10:56.581 --> 10:58.548
It's really stupid.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.085
I can't believe what an idiot I am.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.552
Why? Your coat's nice.

11:02.587 --> 11:04.088
Well, that's just it: It is nice.

11:04.123 --> 11:05.590
But this guy's...
Marshall's...

11:05.625 --> 11:07.092
Clothes are hideous.

11:07.127 --> 11:08.558
It's famous.

11:08.593 --> 11:11.096
But to give him my
coat to put over them...

11:11.596 --> 11:12.597
It's so stupid.

11:13.098 --> 11:14.599
It's just really stupid.

11:14.634 --> 11:16.566
It's not stupid.

11:16.601 --> 11:18.103
This club's really hard to get into.

11:18.603 --> 11:21.071
It was unbelievably, incredibly dumb.

11:21.106 --> 11:23.608
He's a really nice
guy, and I insulted him.

11:23.643 --> 11:25.610
This nice guy that I stupidly insulted

11:25.645 --> 11:26.611
Is basically my boss.

11:27.112 --> 11:30.082
God, it was really stupid.

11:30.117 --> 11:32.368
Guess you're right.

11:32.403 --> 11:34.619
It was pretty stupid.

11:39.624 --> 11:42.627
Uh, can I get you a drink?

Hi!

12:38.166 --> 12:39.167
What do you mean?

12:40.669 --> 12:42.170
When I turned him away
with a group of his clients,

12:42.205 --> 12:45.173
He snuck around back,
where you let them in.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.175
I didn't let 'em in.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.910
They're inside.

Rick just saw them.

I'm not out here on jerk patrol

Van told him you were letting people

In the back again.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.721
When you let people in the back,

13:32.756 --> 13:33.722
Is a cover being charged?

13:51.775 --> 13:53.206
That isn't true, is it?

13:53.241 --> 13:54.743
No, it's true. I can confirm that.

13:54.778 --> 13:55.744
This Jimmy Steinway,

13:56.244 --> 13:56.745
I don't want in the club.

still let in people

14:09.292 --> 14:10.258
From the list.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.725
Don't contradict me, des.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.261
I don't want a lot of
ad people in the club,

14:13.762 --> 14:15.263
Particularly not this guy.

14:15.597 --> 14:16.730
Well, I didn't let him in.

14:16.765 --> 14:18.767
If van didn't either,
he's not in the club.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.268
Did I ever tell you that my first job

14:20.303 --> 14:22.235
Was in
advertising... At y&r?

14:22.270 --> 14:25.774
In those days, the big thing
was to be nice to everybody...

14:25.809 --> 14:28.276
To the secretaries, to
the "media department,"

14:28.311 --> 14:30.045
To the art director,
to the client...

14:30.080 --> 14:31.780
Well, I don't think it's that way now.

14:31.947 --> 14:32.746
I don't care.

14:32.781 --> 14:36.251
I don't want that element in the club.

14:36.286 --> 14:38.787
Jimmy is, like, my best friend.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.606
And you've been a good
friend to him, des,

14:41.641 --> 14:44.292
But this Jimmy is not
a good friend to you.

14:44.327 --> 14:45.293
He's out of control.

14:45.794 --> 14:47.295
He's an egomaniac.

14:48.796 --> 14:50.297
Uh, Jimmy.

14:50.798 --> 14:52.049
Where were you? What a nightmare?

14:52.084 --> 14:53.300
Listen, I don't know how you got in,

14:53.335 --> 14:54.301
But you'd better go.

14:54.336 --> 14:55.319
What?

14:55.354 --> 14:56.268
This way.

14:56.303 --> 14:57.805
You're asking me to leave?

14:57.840 --> 14:59.271
Van has gone crazy.

14:59.306 --> 15:01.308
He made Bernie promise to fire me

15:01.343 --> 15:02.274
If he found you here.

15:02.309 --> 15:04.311
Bernie hates ad agency
people. It's nuts.

15:04.812 --> 15:05.778
I can't believe it!

15:05.813 --> 15:07.064
That's like something out of the nazis!

15:07.099 --> 15:08.315
Come on. I will get
you back on the list,

15:08.350 --> 15:09.584
But tonight, it's best if you go.

15:09.619 --> 15:10.818
Could I at least go tell my client

15:10.853 --> 15:11.819
That I've
got to go...

15:11.854 --> 15:12.786
No.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.286
Please.

15:14.321 --> 15:16.323
Tell him I got ejected.

15:16.358 --> 15:17.324
His name is hap.

15:17.359 --> 15:18.290
Ok.

15:18.325 --> 15:20.577

15:20.612 --> 15:22.830
Who's occupying my booth. Alice.

15:22.865 --> 15:24.296
She's irritating?

15:24.331 --> 15:25.332
I thought she seemed nice.

15:25.367 --> 15:26.834
You know her?

15:27.167 --> 15:28.719
Well, she's been here 2 times before.

15:32.339 --> 15:33.590
How is she irritating?

15:33.625 --> 15:34.807
I can't believe it.

18:25.012 --> 18:27.014
Ever since I was 6 years old or so,

18:27.049 --> 18:28.515
I sensed I was somehow...

18:28.815 --> 18:30.983
different.

18:31.018 --> 18:34.521
Then, every time
you made love to me...

18:34.556 --> 18:35.522
You must have wanted to vomit.

18:36.023 --> 18:38.991
No. No, no.

18:39.026 --> 18:40.527
Oh, you're beautiful!

18:41.028 --> 18:44.031
You don't have to be some sweaty, horny,

18:44.531 --> 18:48.035
Hetero he-Ape to admire
and... And appreciate...

18:48.070 --> 18:49.501
female beauty...

18:49.536 --> 18:52.504
only very, very recently

18:52.539 --> 18:54.041
Did the final realization come.

18:54.124 --> 18:57.044
Exactly when did the
final realization come?

18:57.079 --> 18:59.011
2 days ago.

18:59.046 --> 19:01.548
I get up late and
usually turn on the TV,

19:01.583 --> 19:03.067
Sort of as a reflex.

19:03.102 --> 19:04.516
Wednesday afternoon,

19:04.551 --> 19:06.518
There was a rerun of wild kingdom,

19:06.553 --> 19:10.057
Mutual of Omaha's nature
program with marlin Perkins

19:10.092 --> 19:15.062
And that... attractive, younger guy.

19:16.563 --> 19:19.531
It triggered something.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.568
Suddenly everything fell into place.

19:21.603 --> 19:24.036
I'm gay...

19:24.071 --> 19:27.039
and always have been.

19:27.074 --> 19:30.077
You only found out you were gay

19:30.112 --> 19:31.543
On Wednesday?

19:31.578 --> 19:34.081
Only then definitively.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.083
Wednesday was...

19:36.583 --> 19:39.586
gay day for me.

19:41.588 --> 19:42.839
Finished eavesdropping?

19:42.874 --> 19:44.091
I wasn't eavesdropping.

19:44.591 --> 19:46.593
Come on. Anything interesting?

19:46.927 --> 19:48.560
Shh. God!

19:48.595 --> 19:51.598
Listen, it's much better
you're with Tom than Jimmy.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.567
You two really look great together.

19:53.602 --> 19:54.566
You think so?

19:54.601 --> 19:57.104
It's too bad we weren't
closer friends in college.

19:57.139 --> 19:59.573
I think I could really
have helped you there.

19:59.608 --> 20:02.109
For most guys,

20:02.242 --> 20:04.111
Sexual repressiveness is a turn-Off.

20:04.277 --> 20:06.113
You're saying this for my benefit?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.580
You're a good conversationalist but...

20:08.615 --> 20:10.117
there's something of
the kindergarten teacher

20:10.152 --> 20:11.083
About you.

20:11.118 --> 20:12.619
It's really nice, but...

20:12.786 --> 20:15.122
the guys you like also tend
to be on the ethereal side.

20:15.288 --> 20:16.206
It can get pretty far away

20:16.241 --> 20:17.124
From any kind of physicality.

20:17.624 --> 20:20.127
This is gonna sound
dumb, but it really works.

20:20.162 --> 20:21.093
Whenever you can,

20:21.128 --> 20:23.130
Throw the word "sexy"
into your conversation.

20:23.630 --> 20:25.132
It's kind of a signal.

20:25.167 --> 20:26.098
Like, um...

20:26.133 --> 20:30.137
"there's something really
sexy about strobe lights."

20:30.172 --> 20:33.105
Or, uh...

20:33.140 --> 20:35.642
"this fabric is so sexy."

20:37.110 --> 20:41.113
Yeah, it is.

20:41.148 --> 20:45.152

make it on through ♪♪

20:45.187 --> 20:47.154

20:47.654 --> 20:49.406
Josh?

20:49.441 --> 20:51.123
Uh, hi.

20:51.158 --> 20:52.659
What are you doing here?

20:52.694 --> 20:54.161
In New York or in the club?

20:54.196 --> 20:55.627
In the city.

20:55.662 --> 20:57.629
I'm an a.D.A. In Morgenthau's office.

20:57.664 --> 21:00.167
An assistant district
attorney for manhattan.

21:00.202 --> 21:01.686
They call us "a.D.A.'S."

21:01.721 --> 21:03.135
You're a prosecutor?

21:03.170 --> 21:04.421
God, how did you get that?

21:04.456 --> 21:05.672
It's not such a big deal...

21:06.673 --> 21:09.676
I'm perfectly competent
to do the job, des.

21:09.711 --> 21:11.143
Great. Good.

21:11.178 --> 21:13.145
I wasn't implying anything.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.682
I was just surprised to see you here.

21:18.685 --> 21:20.687
Going to Harvard must have been great.

21:20.722 --> 21:21.653
Well...

21:21.688 --> 21:22.689
the people at Hampshire were nice,

21:23.190 --> 21:25.192
And pretty smart, in
a nontraditional way,

21:25.227 --> 21:27.159
But I was out of place there.

21:27.194 --> 21:29.661
I'm sorry, I don't consider the guy

21:29.696 --> 21:31.698
Who did the Spiderman
comics a serious writer.

21:31.733 --> 21:33.200
Yeah, I thought it was the green hornet

21:33.235 --> 21:35.469
People took more seriously.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.669
Um, excuse me, are you Alice?

21:37.704 --> 21:40.207
Jimmy Steinway gave me this
vodka-Tonic to give you,

21:40.242 --> 21:41.007
But I'm afraid I sampled it.

21:41.541 --> 21:42.209
I'll get you another.

21:42.244 --> 21:43.210
Jimmy's gone?

21:43.543 --> 21:45.177
You're "hap"?

21:45.212 --> 21:46.713
Yeah, he wanted me to
tell you he's sorry,

21:46.748 --> 21:47.714
But he was ejected from the club.

21:47.749 --> 21:50.217
He was ejected?

21:50.550 --> 21:51.718
Apparently he snuck one of his clients

21:51.753 --> 21:53.685
In the back of the club.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.722
That's odd he knew
I drank vodka-Tonics.

21:55.757 --> 21:57.725
I never told him.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.658
It's uncanny.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.193
You mean, it's a complete cliche?

22:01.228 --> 22:03.230
"All women recent college
graduates drink vodka-Tonics,"

22:03.265 --> 22:04.231
Or something like that?

22:04.266 --> 22:07.199
Well, maybe.

22:07.234 --> 22:09.201
So Jimmy think's I'm a total cliche

22:09.236 --> 22:11.238
I ordered a vodka-Tonic,
too... So what?

22:11.538 --> 22:12.739
You're plenty original

22:13.073 --> 22:14.241
Without having to
order some weirdo drink.

22:14.741 --> 22:15.375
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.

22:15.742 --> 22:16.708
Can I get you another?

22:16.743 --> 22:19.246
Thanks. Actually, if you don't mind,

22:19.281 --> 22:20.247
I think I'd prefer...

22:20.413 --> 22:22.249

23:22.976 --> 23:23.777
Great.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.781
I'm a little worried about that guy.

23:27.816 --> 23:29.049
I think he might be having

23:29.084 --> 23:30.248
A manic episode of some kind.

We were all at Harvard together.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.326
How did you get involved
with environmental causes?

24:13.361 --> 24:14.327
I think that's great.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.329
You're interested in the environment?

24:16.364 --> 24:17.295
Very much so.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.331
Actually, there's one theory

24:18.832 --> 24:19.833
That the environmental
movement of our day

24:20.333 --> 24:21.835
Was sparked by the re-Release of bambi

24:21.870 --> 24:22.801
In the late 1950s.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.838
For many members of the
baby boom generation,

24:25.338 --> 24:25.839
It was traumatic...

24:26.339 --> 24:27.841
the hunters killing bambi's mother.

24:27.876 --> 24:30.308
Yeah, it was terrible.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.345
For 6-Year-Olds,
it's devastating.

24:32.380 --> 24:34.347
To this day, no one wants to identify

24:34.382 --> 24:36.116
With those hunters.

24:36.151 --> 24:37.851
I think you're right.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.356
You're living in some women's residence,

24:43.391 --> 24:44.823
Aren't you?

24:44.858 --> 24:46.860
Yeah. It's terrible.

24:46.895 --> 24:48.862
No guests.

24:48.897 --> 24:51.064
Huh.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.341
Wow.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.378
It's really nice.

25:05.413 --> 25:06.379
Thanks.

25:10.133 --> 25:13.253
Would you like anything to drink?

25:14.888 --> 25:15.889
What?

25:15.924 --> 25:16.855
Um...

25:16.890 --> 25:18.892
could I have...

25:20.059 --> 25:21.227
a pernod?

25:21.262 --> 25:22.395
Sure.

25:22.896 --> 25:23.897
This is supposed to be good

25:24.314 --> 25:25.398
For cigarette mouth.

25:25.433 --> 25:26.399
Do you smoke?

25:26.766 --> 25:27.901
When I drink or go out at night,

25:28.401 --> 25:29.402
I usually smoke.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.404
I live dangerously.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.907
On the edge.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.693
I'm no kindergarten teacher.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.415
What's this?

25:42.916 --> 25:44.918
Um, I collect original edition

25:45.418 --> 25:46.419
Scrooge Mcduck comics.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.921
It sounds a little odd.

25:48.421 --> 25:49.422
Not at all.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.425
This is original artwork by Carl barks,

25:52.926 --> 25:55.428
Who created the uncle scrooge comics.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.932
He's considered a bit of a genius.

26:02.936 --> 26:06.940
There's something really

27:56.885 --> 27:58.235

27:58.270 --> 27:59.550
I didn't check.

27:59.585 --> 28:02.053
Well, was it light or dark?

28:02.088 --> 28:04.090
Why do you care what time I got in?

28:04.125 --> 28:05.556
Sorry. No reason.

28:05.591 --> 28:07.593
We've got to get an
apartment of our own.

28:07.628 --> 28:09.095
Do you know how long it takes

28:09.130 --> 28:10.061
To become an editor?

28:10.096 --> 28:12.414
You mean associate editor.

28:12.449 --> 28:14.733
Yeah. Associate editor.

28:15.601 --> 28:17.102
What's the minimum amount of time

28:17.137 --> 28:18.604
To become an associate editor?

28:18.639 --> 28:20.106
How many years?

28:20.606 --> 28:21.607
That's hard to say.

28:21.941 --> 28:22.608
Approximately.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.110
Maybe 4 years.

28:24.577 --> 28:25.576
But more than years,

28:25.611 --> 28:28.114
Before you can become
an associate editor,

28:28.149 --> 28:29.080
You have to have a best seller.

28:29.115 --> 28:30.616
How can you be sure
you'll get a best seller?

28:30.651 --> 28:31.582
You cannot.

28:31.617 --> 28:33.119
But what if you don't find one?

28:33.154 --> 28:34.620
You have to.

28:34.753 --> 28:36.122
Show them the outline.

28:36.422 --> 28:37.588
You might want to see this.

28:37.623 --> 28:40.626
It's the Scott Meredith
best seller outline.

28:40.661 --> 28:42.145
"Create sympathetic characters,

28:42.180 --> 28:43.594
"With whom readers identify.

28:43.629 --> 28:46.465
Give them problems,
make these problems big."

28:49.135 --> 28:50.636
Could I photocopy this?

28:50.671 --> 28:52.405
Yes, but I need it back.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.291
I'd like a copy, too.

28:54.326 --> 28:56.107
That stuff is such crap.

28:56.142 --> 28:58.144
This does describe a
lot of best sellers.

28:58.179 --> 28:59.645
That's true.

28:59.945 --> 29:01.147
It's completely formulaic.

29:01.363 --> 29:03.149
Of course it's
formulaic. It's a formula.

29:03.649 --> 29:05.651
That's why I prefer nonfiction.

29:06.152 --> 29:07.653
It's good you want to
be an editor so much.

29:07.688 --> 29:09.120
In this era of television,

29:09.155 --> 29:11.657
You are devoted to the printed word.

29:11.692 --> 29:12.623
Actually, ultimately,

29:12.658 --> 29:14.125
I'd like to work in television.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.626
But right now, what I need's a raise.

29:15.661 --> 29:17.128
Alice and I have been
looking at apartments,

29:17.163 --> 29:19.165
But we can't afford one on
what we get as assistants.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.168
That's so comical.

29:22.203 --> 29:23.169
What?

29:23.419 --> 29:26.672
That giris like you really
worry about paying rent.

29:26.839 --> 29:28.757
Aren't your fathers heavily subsidizing

29:28.792 --> 29:30.676
Your living expenses
with big allowances?

29:30.843 --> 29:31.642
They're not big at all.

29:31.677 --> 29:33.144
In a few years, you'll marry

29:33.179 --> 29:35.646
Some incredibly rich corporate lawyers.

29:35.681 --> 29:38.184
It's not as if you really
worry about paying the rent

29:38.219 --> 29:39.650
Like the rest of us.

29:39.685 --> 29:40.686
Oh, you worry about paying the rent?

29:41.103 --> 29:42.153
Yeah.

29:42.188 --> 29:43.154
Then you're way ahead of us

29:43.189 --> 29:45.157
'Cause we don't even have an apartment.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.657
What if, in a few years,

29:46.692 --> 29:48.944
We don't marry some corporate lawyer?

29:48.979 --> 29:51.197
What if we marry some meatball like you?

29:51.232 --> 29:52.698
But not you personally,

29:52.831 --> 29:55.701
But someone with similarly
low socioeconomic prospects?

29:58.204 --> 29:59.670
Can you believe that?

29:59.705 --> 30:02.208
They really think that way.

30:02.541 --> 30:04.376
Disco sucks.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.177
What a dope.

30:06.212 --> 30:08.179
Would you ever go out

30:08.214 --> 30:10.216
With anyone who worked in the company?

30:10.251 --> 30:11.182
Fortunately,

30:11.217 --> 30:12.718
There's absolutely no temptation.

30:12.753 --> 30:14.220
Charlotte, telephone.

30:14.255 --> 30:15.721
It's a man.

30:21.227 --> 30:22.728
Hello?

30:22.763 --> 30:24.195
Oh, hi.

30:24.230 --> 30:26.232
We were thinking of having
some people for dinner

30:26.267 --> 30:27.198
Saturday night.

30:27.233 --> 30:28.234
Wanted to know if you could come.

30:28.734 --> 30:30.235
About 7:30.

30:30.270 --> 30:31.702
Ok. Where?

30:31.737 --> 30:34.240
Actually, I'll have to
call you back with that.

30:34.275 --> 30:35.508
Yeah.

30:35.543 --> 30:36.643
Thanks.

30:36.678 --> 30:37.961
Ok.

30:37.996 --> 30:39.245
Bye.

30:39.495 --> 30:40.711
That was Jimmy Steinway.

30:40.746 --> 30:43.249
He's coming for dinner Saturday night.

30:43.284 --> 30:45.301
You called him?

30:47.253 --> 30:49.255
I thought you said you
could never be interested

30:49.290 --> 30:51.188
In anyone who worked in advertising.

30:51.223 --> 30:53.759
No one could say something
like that seriously.

30:53.794 --> 30:56.227
It was obviously a joke.

30:56.262 --> 30:58.264
Anyway, it's not like
it's a date or anything.

30:58.299 --> 30:59.765
He's invited as part of a group.

30:59.898 --> 31:00.731
It's really important

31:00.766 --> 31:02.733
There be more group social life,

31:02.768 --> 31:05.271
Not just all this ferocious pairing off.

31:05.306 --> 31:06.773
You like Tom.

31:06.808 --> 31:08.240
Invite him.

31:08.324 --> 31:10.801
We don't even have an apartment.

31:10.836 --> 31:13.279
How can we have a dinner party?

31:13.529 --> 31:15.781
Well, it's another incentive to get one.

31:22.288 --> 31:24.790
Does the Lexington avenue
express stop at 86th street?

31:24.825 --> 31:25.756
I think so.

31:25.791 --> 31:27.793
We'd better hurry.

31:27.876 --> 31:29.795
Do you really think we
know each other well enough

31:29.830 --> 31:31.262
To room together?

31:31.297 --> 31:32.763
Well, maybe that's good.

31:32.798 --> 31:36.302
It's not just that we
don't know each other well.

31:36.337 --> 31:38.804
I'm not even sure we
really like each other.

31:38.839 --> 31:40.306
That's ok.

31:42.308 --> 31:43.274
You know, Alice,

31:43.309 --> 31:46.312
I'm not so much of a
bitch as I might seem.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.316
You'll find holly's a little sensitive

31:50.351 --> 31:51.317
About her intelligence.

31:51.352 --> 31:52.318
She's dumb?

31:52.785 --> 31:54.303
Harvard guys, even the ones that

31:54.338 --> 31:55.830
Seem reasonably cool on the outside,

31:55.865 --> 31:57.323
Are all essentially wimps and bookworms

31:57.358 --> 31:58.789
On the inside.

31:58.824 --> 32:01.327
They love being seen out
with this lovely girl,

32:01.362 --> 32:02.595
But after a date or two,

32:02.630 --> 32:03.980
Rather than risk rejection,

32:04.015 --> 32:05.296
They pretend to drop her,

32:05.331 --> 32:07.833
Going around complaining
about how dull she was.

32:07.868 --> 32:08.834
Is she dull?

32:08.967 --> 32:10.801
A little, but that's not the point.

32:10.836 --> 32:12.338
Once you start worrying
about something like that,

32:12.373 --> 32:13.839
You're lost.

32:14.139 --> 32:15.306
Holly was devastated.

32:15.341 --> 32:17.092
She stopped dating entirely,

32:17.127 --> 32:18.809
And weekends either went home

32:18.844 --> 32:22.348
Or just hung around the
library at pine manor.

32:22.383 --> 32:24.850
What do you think you're doing?

32:24.885 --> 32:26.518
Shove off, Mack!

32:27.353 --> 32:28.354
Deviant!

32:28.487 --> 32:30.272
Creep! Off!

32:34.360 --> 32:36.362
So I wouldn't develop any illusions

32:36.397 --> 32:37.328
About Harvard guys.

32:37.363 --> 32:39.782
They can be amazing creeps, too.

32:43.369 --> 32:44.370
Ah, there you are.

32:44.405 --> 32:45.336
Hi.

32:45.371 --> 32:47.873
Our friend still isn't here.

32:51.877 --> 32:53.879
Sorry. I forgot which
way the numbers went

32:53.914 --> 32:55.381
On the east side.

33:02.855 --> 33:06.357
It's what's called a railroad apartment.

33:06.392 --> 33:10.896
It's long and rather
narrow like a railroad car.

33:12.898 --> 33:15.901
Each room opens directly onto the other.

33:17.403 --> 33:19.370
It's very nice.

33:19.405 --> 33:21.407
The closets are here.

33:21.442 --> 33:23.409
This is the other bedroom.

33:26.462 --> 33:28.914
The bathroom is back here at this end.

33:29.415 --> 33:30.916
And the kitchen.

33:31.917 --> 33:34.920
So to get to the bathroom
from the living room,

33:34.955 --> 33:36.922
You have to clomp through both bedrooms?

33:37.222 --> 33:39.425
Well, there are 2 outside doors,

33:39.460 --> 33:40.926
So in theory,

33:41.427 --> 33:42.928
You can use the exterior hall

33:43.429 --> 33:44.930
To go between the kitchen
and the living room.

33:45.431 --> 33:46.897
Huh.

33:46.932 --> 33:49.935
Even with 2 roommates, the
layout is a bit awkward.

33:50.436 --> 33:51.437
You can't afford something bigger?

33:51.937 --> 33:52.938
We all work in book publishing.

33:53.439 --> 33:54.440
Couldn't your parents help?

33:54.940 --> 33:55.941
They already are.

33:56.442 --> 33:58.026
So what do you think?

33:58.061 --> 33:59.611
I think it's really nice.

34:00.446 --> 34:02.865
Isn't the layout a bit awkward?

34:02.900 --> 34:05.284
Well, I think we should take it.

34:07.419 --> 34:08.918
Here you go.

34:08.954 --> 34:10.922
It's good to see bourgeois giris

34:10.958 --> 34:12.458
Building up a sweat.

34:12.623 --> 34:13.458
Why is that good to see?

34:13.958 --> 34:14.925
You live around here?

34:14.960 --> 34:16.462
There was a guild
meeting at asphalt green.

34:16.496 --> 34:17.761
A guild meeting?

34:17.795 --> 34:18.964
The newspaper guild
is organizing clerical

34:19.465 --> 34:20.966
And editorial staff for book publishing.

34:21.467 --> 34:22.967
I'm supposed to organize our department.

34:23.469 --> 34:25.471
Oh, my god. We're all
gonna lose our jobs.

34:25.804 --> 34:26.472
You should support this.

34:26.972 --> 34:29.942
You were just complaining
how lousy the pay is.

34:31.476 --> 34:33.478
Are you rooming with them?

34:33.978 --> 34:36.482
That's gonna be really tough.

34:40.619 --> 34:41.487
Aren't we behind schedule?

34:41.987 --> 34:43.989
Nope. This recipe's extremely fast.

34:51.496 --> 34:51.996
Hello.

34:52.498 --> 34:53.998
Uh, it's Dan.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.168
Dan?

34:58.504 --> 35:00.005
Hi. Come up.

35:01.507 --> 35:02.508
Dan from your department.

35:03.008 --> 35:04.510
I invited him.

35:05.010 --> 35:06.512
Departmental Dan?

35:08.514 --> 35:09.515
You know...

35:10.015 --> 35:11.517
he went to Harvard.

35:11.683 --> 35:13.735
So?

35:16.021 --> 35:17.523
Yeah, I've got to meet
some clients at 10:00

35:18.023 --> 35:19.157
And get them into the club.

35:22.027 --> 35:23.494
Tom isn't coming?

35:23.529 --> 35:25.531
If he does, he'll be very late.

35:25.864 --> 35:27.533
Isn't this what they
call a railroad apartment?

35:28.033 --> 35:29.034
Uh-Huh.

35:29.451 --> 35:30.536
People always say how terrible they are,

35:30.571 --> 35:32.037
But it seems pretty nice.

35:32.204 --> 35:34.505
Well, the layout's not so good.

35:34.540 --> 35:35.506
It's amazing the little things in life

35:35.541 --> 35:37.543
One doesn't appreciate
until they're missing,

35:37.578 --> 35:39.545
Such as hallways.

35:39.711 --> 35:41.129
These apartments were actually planned

35:41.164 --> 35:42.548
In the last century as tenement housing

35:42.583 --> 35:44.014
For working class families.

35:44.049 --> 35:45.551
Now all the yuppie roommate combos

35:45.586 --> 35:47.386
Are crowding them out.

35:49.054 --> 35:50.020
Well...

35:50.055 --> 35:52.558
that's just tough.

36:04.068 --> 36:05.319
Fight!

36:05.354 --> 36:06.571
Rumble!

36:11.492 --> 36:13.077
Actually, I was thinking I'd go home.

36:13.112 --> 36:14.043
What?

36:14.078 --> 36:15.329
You should come.

36:15.364 --> 36:16.546
I don't know.

36:16.581 --> 36:18.082
I'm not really a disco type.

36:18.117 --> 36:19.549
Well, who is?

36:19.584 --> 36:22.051
I probably wouldn't get in anyway.

36:22.086 --> 36:25.089
Of course you'll get
in. Holly's gorgeous.

37:27.151 --> 37:28.618
Have fun, jack, harry.

37:28.653 --> 37:30.655
Thanks a lot, des. I
really appreciate it.

37:30.690 --> 37:31.621
Fine, cool.

37:31.656 --> 37:33.658
I'm starting to realize how
important eye contact is.

37:33.693 --> 37:35.124
I can't talk to people in this thing.

37:35.159 --> 37:37.161
They get nervous. They
don't know who I am.

37:37.196 --> 37:39.128
Well, that's the point.

37:39.163 --> 37:41.165
You think tonight would be a good time

37:41.200 --> 37:42.632
To talk to van?

37:42.667 --> 37:45.169
Try to patch things up,
get a reprieve of some sort?

37:45.204 --> 37:47.136
Uh, no.

37:47.171 --> 37:49.138
My job's sort of on the line, des.

37:49.173 --> 37:51.175
And not all clients
will be such good sports

37:51.210 --> 37:52.642
As harry and jack.

37:52.677 --> 37:54.679
If it's a question of groveling,

37:55.012 --> 37:55.645
I can do that.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.181
Just point me in the right direction.

37:57.216 --> 37:58.648
Shh! God!

37:58.683 --> 38:00.685
Can I show you something?

38:00.720 --> 38:01.686
Sure. What?

38:05.072 --> 38:08.192
You know something
about banking, don't you?

38:08.227 --> 38:10.695
Yeah. Manny hanny used to be a client.

38:10.730 --> 38:12.161
Manufacturers hanover.

38:12.196 --> 38:14.699
I know what manny hanny is.

38:28.212 --> 38:29.964
Note...

38:29.999 --> 38:31.716
no lock.

38:52.570 --> 38:54.238
10 is the cover charge.

38:54.705 --> 38:56.741
God. Paying a cover
charge to get into a club?

38:56.776 --> 38:57.742
How humiliating.

38:58.242 --> 38:59.994
That's your reaction?

39:01.746 --> 39:03.713
Look at this.

39:03.748 --> 39:06.050
Kind of worrisome, don't you think?

39:07.251 --> 39:08.217
Yeah.

39:08.252 --> 39:10.254
To me, shipping cash to Switzerland

39:10.289 --> 39:11.220
In canvas bags

39:11.255 --> 39:12.722
Doesn't sound honest.

39:12.757 --> 39:16.260
To me, it suggests possible illegality.

39:16.295 --> 39:18.227
Well, what are you gonna do?

39:18.262 --> 39:20.765
Well, I'm not going
into that room anymore.

39:22.767 --> 39:23.768
Uh, gimlet, please?

39:23.984 --> 39:26.612
Domestic beer or bud?

39:26.647 --> 39:29.240
Um... whiskey sour?

39:30.741 --> 39:32.708
Excuse me.

39:32.743 --> 39:34.745
You're Alice Kinnon, aren't you?

39:34.780 --> 39:35.711
Yeah.

39:35.746 --> 39:37.248
We met at that party in sag harbor,

39:37.283 --> 39:38.714
Labor day weekend.

39:38.749 --> 39:40.250
You were just coming
in as I was leaving,

39:40.285 --> 39:41.752
And you asked me where the kitchen was.

39:41.787 --> 39:43.219
Do you remember?

39:43.254 --> 39:45.256
I do remember getting to the kitchen.

39:45.291 --> 39:46.222
Uh, excuse us.

39:46.257 --> 39:48.759
We're here sort of as a group.

39:48.794 --> 39:50.261
If you don't mind?

39:51.762 --> 39:52.763
Excuse me.

39:54.265 --> 39:56.232
Why did you say that?

39:56.267 --> 39:58.234
I didn't like the look of him at all.

39:58.269 --> 40:01.272
Didn't you notice how
he was eyeballing you?

40:01.307 --> 40:02.238
Creepy.

40:02.273 --> 40:04.275
Frankly, I thought he
might've been the guy

40:04.310 --> 40:06.044
That bothered me on the subway.

40:06.079 --> 40:07.778
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

40:07.813 --> 40:08.744
Poor guy.

40:08.779 --> 40:10.246
It's no big deal.

40:10.281 --> 40:12.283
That kind of thing happens all the time.

40:12.318 --> 40:14.285

How did it go?

40:45.351 --> 40:46.282
Fine.

40:46.317 --> 40:47.818
You know, they closed the airport.

40:47.853 --> 40:49.337

41:16.130 --> 41:18.849
Do you remember the conversation we had

41:18.884 --> 41:20.316
Labor day weekend?

41:20.351 --> 41:22.853
Had a huge impact on me.

41:22.888 --> 41:23.819
Really?

41:23.854 --> 41:26.357
Jennifer and I had been talking all year

41:26.392 --> 41:27.323
About either acknowledging

41:27.358 --> 41:28.859
The permanence of our
relationship and marrying

41:29.109 --> 41:30.826
Or finally just breaking up.

41:30.861 --> 41:33.364
I had no idea you were
even dating anyone.

41:33.864 --> 41:35.566
I thought you knew.

41:37.368 --> 41:39.870
No. We've been together since college.

41:39.905 --> 41:41.372
But the weekend after labor day,

41:41.407 --> 41:43.339
We had this long talk.

41:43.374 --> 41:45.341
Jennifer proposed a trial separation,

41:45.376 --> 41:47.378
Which normally I'd have
considered ridiculous,

41:47.413 --> 41:49.880
But I couldn't help thinking of you

41:49.915 --> 41:51.382
And went along.

41:51.799 --> 41:53.349
Out of some sort of

41:53.384 --> 41:54.885
Residual loyalty to Jennifer,

41:54.920 --> 41:56.352
I didn't call you immediately

41:56.387 --> 41:58.639
And instead started coming to the club.

41:58.674 --> 42:00.891
I'm not a very
good dancer, but...

42:00.926 --> 42:02.358
No, you are.

42:02.393 --> 42:04.895
I was also curious if
the sexual revolution

42:04.930 --> 42:07.165
Went as far as everyone said it had.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.400
But emotionally, I couldn't handle it.

42:09.900 --> 42:12.402
I got so depressed, and...

42:12.437 --> 42:14.905
when I saw you that night,

42:15.322 --> 42:17.873
You were... a vision,

42:17.908 --> 42:20.160
Not just of loveliness, but of...

42:21.412 --> 42:22.413
virtue...

42:22.913 --> 42:24.915
and sanity.

42:27.418 --> 42:28.419
What?

42:28.535 --> 42:30.386
I shouldn't talk about it.

42:30.421 --> 42:32.873
I'll just end up sounding like an idiot.

42:32.957 --> 42:33.841
No, what?

42:34.425 --> 42:35.926
You're very sexy

42:36.427 --> 42:39.930
And good-Looking and modern and hot.

42:40.431 --> 42:41.932
But what I was craving

42:42.433 --> 42:44.435
Was a sort of sentient individual

42:44.935 --> 42:46.437
Who wouldn't abandon her intelligence

42:46.887 --> 42:48.439
To hop into bed with every guy she meets

42:48.939 --> 42:49.440
In a nightclub.

42:49.890 --> 42:51.442
Why... why is it that when people have

42:51.942 --> 42:52.943
Sex-With-Strangers
on their mind,

42:53.444 --> 42:56.447
Their I.Q. Just drops, like, 40 points?

42:56.947 --> 42:58.449
All that affected

42:58.949 --> 43:01.368
Sexy seductress slinking around?

43:01.952 --> 43:03.454
And uncle scrooge is sexy?

43:03.954 --> 43:06.407
I mean, my god, is there no limit?

43:06.490 --> 43:07.339
No. That
was to...

43:07.374 --> 43:08.424
Do you think I'm an idiot?

43:08.459 --> 43:11.962
I'm so sick of all
the lies and nonsense!

43:12.163 --> 43:13.629
Alice?

43:13.664 --> 43:15.166
Alice, what's wrong?

43:16.667 --> 43:17.668
What happened?

43:22.673 --> 43:23.674
Mcgrath! Where is he?

43:23.891 --> 43:26.677
I'd say it's definitely not a good idea

43:26.712 --> 43:28.179
To approach van tonight.

43:28.214 --> 43:29.680
There he is.

43:29.715 --> 43:31.147
Mcgrath!

43:31.182 --> 43:32.615
Drew Mcgrath.

43:32.650 --> 43:35.186
You're out of here right now.

43:35.221 --> 43:36.152
What?

43:36.187 --> 43:37.688
Bernie. Bernie!

43:38.155 --> 43:39.673
Where is he? Here he is.

43:39.708 --> 43:41.192
Bernie, this guy's through.

43:41.525 --> 43:42.658
What's going on?

43:42.693 --> 43:45.195
We had a public safety
situation in the front.

43:45.230 --> 43:47.698
This jerk comes out,
trying to make it worse.

43:47.998 --> 43:48.699
Is this true?

43:48.916 --> 43:51.202
Public safety situation?
Give me a break.

43:51.237 --> 43:52.668
It was a joke. I'm sorry.

43:52.703 --> 43:55.063
We had a public safety situation.

43:55.098 --> 43:57.424
The cops came. It was no joke.

43:58.209 --> 44:00.211
I tease him a tiny bit.

44:00.511 --> 44:01.712
No teasing, des.

44:01.929 --> 44:04.215
No teasing?

44:04.381 --> 44:05.716
Either he goes or I do.

44:06.183 --> 44:07.718
Come on, van. Des, grow up.

44:07.753 --> 44:09.237
Cut it out.

44:09.272 --> 44:10.721
Ok. Sorry.

44:13.724 --> 44:15.226
It's the ad guy.

44:15.359 --> 44:17.228
So, it's the dancing ad man.

44:17.695 --> 44:18.729
You're finished.

44:19.146 --> 44:22.233
Ok, I work in advertising.
Is that a crime?

44:22.268 --> 44:24.285
What's happening in this country?

44:25.402 --> 44:27.738
There they are! Get 'em!

44:29.740 --> 44:31.742
Get the tin man. Get him.

44:33.744 --> 44:36.297
Get this jerk out of the club.

44:37.548 --> 44:39.750
You're fired, des. You're out of here.

44:39.785 --> 44:41.019
You can't fire me, van.

44:41.054 --> 44:42.253
Only Bernie can fire me.

44:42.419 --> 44:43.719
Ok.

44:43.754 --> 44:45.256
You're fired.

44:45.472 --> 44:49.226
And take this yuppie scum with you.

44:56.233 --> 44:57.268
Good riddance!

44:57.303 --> 44:59.235
Yuppie scum?

44:59.270 --> 45:01.237
In college, before dropping out,

45:01.272 --> 45:04.024
I took a course in the
propaganda uses of language.

45:04.059 --> 45:06.777
One objective is to deny
other people's humanity

45:06.812 --> 45:08.046
Or even right to exist.

45:08.081 --> 45:09.245
In the men's lounge,

45:09.280 --> 45:11.782
Someone scrawled "kill yuppie scum."

45:11.817 --> 45:13.749
Do yuppies even exist?

45:13.784 --> 45:15.751
No one says, "I am a yuppie."

45:15.786 --> 45:17.788
It's always the other
guy who's a yuppie.

45:17.823 --> 45:19.255
I think for a group to exist,

45:19.290 --> 45:21.292
Somebody has to admit to be part of it.

45:21.327 --> 45:22.758
Of course yuppies exist.

45:22.793 --> 45:26.297
Most people would say you
two are prime specimens.

45:26.332 --> 45:27.263
We're not yuppies!

45:27.298 --> 45:28.764
You think we're yuppies?

45:28.799 --> 45:31.302
You're seriously saying
you're not yuppies?

45:31.337 --> 45:32.303
No.

45:33.804 --> 45:37.308
Yuppie stands for "young
upwardly mobile professional."

45:37.343 --> 45:40.311
Nightclub flunky is not
a professional category.

45:40.346 --> 45:41.277
Contrary to popular belief,

45:41.312 --> 45:43.814
Junior-Level ad jobs
don't pay well at all.

45:44.031 --> 45:45.781
I wish we were yuppies:

45:45.816 --> 45:47.818
Young, upwardly mobile, professional.

45:47.853 --> 45:49.820
Those are good things, not bad things.

45:49.855 --> 45:50.838
Where we going?

45:50.873 --> 45:51.822
Rex's. Oh, no.

45:52.323 --> 45:53.574
What's wrong with rex's?

45:53.609 --> 45:54.790
Well, you can't dance there,

45:54.825 --> 45:56.326
And it's full of boring preppies.

45:56.361 --> 45:57.828
Oh, and we're so interesting.

45:57.863 --> 45:59.295
You can dance at rex's.

45:59.330 --> 46:01.832
Yeah, but why rex's?
Why not some other place?

46:01.867 --> 46:02.798
Well, for one thing,

46:02.833 --> 46:04.335
Everyone at the club
knows that I go there,

46:04.370 --> 46:05.336
So when they come looking for me,

46:05.371 --> 46:06.802
I wanna be there.

46:06.837 --> 46:08.589
Why would they come looking for you?

46:08.624 --> 46:10.306
What happened tonight was a mistake,

46:10.341 --> 46:12.343
Which even now Bernie's
probably very much regretting.

46:12.378 --> 46:13.809
He's a smart guy.

46:13.844 --> 46:15.846
Not without good qualities...

46:15.881 --> 46:17.848
even if very few.

46:18.015 --> 46:19.850
I wouldn't be very surprised
if he's already called rex's

46:19.885 --> 46:21.317
To retract my dismissal.

46:21.352 --> 46:23.854
How can you be so sure of that?

46:23.889 --> 46:25.856
Well, I'm not sure of it.

46:26.857 --> 46:28.324

Hey. Hey, rex.

46:38.888 --> 46:40.169
Welcome to rex's.

46:40.204 --> 46:41.705
Alice, you look like you've seen

46:41.740 --> 46:42.706
The dark side of the moon.

46:42.741 --> 46:43.672
What did Tom say?

46:43.707 --> 46:45.174
No. I feel much better.

46:45.209 --> 46:47.711
I love your idea of
social life as a group,

46:47.746 --> 46:50.481
Without all this ferocious pairing off.

46:50.516 --> 46:53.217
I couldn't have stood
being alone tonight.

46:58.355 --> 47:01.225
I thought Bernie was smarter than that.

47:01.260 --> 47:04.228
What a blunder.

47:04.361 --> 47:07.231
When they do call, we'll
get you immediately.

47:07.266 --> 47:08.232
Thanks, rex.

47:09.233 --> 47:11.235
Rex is such a great guy.

47:11.535 --> 47:13.737
Yeah. Charlotte says she can
tell if a guy's gay or not

47:13.772 --> 47:14.738
Just by looking in his eyes.

47:15.072 --> 47:16.740
How?

47:16.873 --> 47:19.243
Maybe it's related to
how they look at you.

47:19.278 --> 47:20.709
It's hard to define,

47:20.744 --> 47:23.247
But I think women can tell.

47:23.282 --> 47:24.713
I can't.

47:24.748 --> 47:27.834
Are Jimmy or I gay?

47:27.869 --> 47:30.921
Come on, don't.

47:32.256 --> 47:33.507
Jimmy?

47:33.542 --> 47:34.758
No.

47:38.262 --> 47:39.228
Well, not your eyes,

47:39.263 --> 47:41.231
But you do have a gay mouth.

47:41.315 --> 47:42.231
A gay mouth?

47:42.266 --> 47:43.267
I have a gay mouth?

47:43.302 --> 47:44.268
What does that mean?

47:44.434 --> 47:45.734
Just what I said.

47:45.769 --> 47:47.771
It's true, des. Your
mouth does look gay.

47:48.105 --> 47:50.774
God! How moronic can you get?

47:50.809 --> 47:52.276
What nonsense!

47:52.409 --> 47:54.278
Don't think I don't know your whole act.

47:54.778 --> 47:55.279
Excuse me?

47:55.779 --> 47:57.246
Pretending to be gay

47:57.281 --> 47:58.532
To get sympathy from women

47:58.567 --> 47:59.783
While cruelly dumping them,

48:00.284 --> 48:02.286
And to seem cooler
than you actually are.

48:02.452 --> 48:04.621
I despise your whole pathetic act.

48:04.656 --> 48:06.790
You're not fit to lick the boots

48:06.825 --> 48:08.258
Of my real gay friends.

48:08.342 --> 48:10.794
Well, I don't want to lick the boots

48:10.829 --> 48:13.547
Of your real gay friends.

48:13.582 --> 48:16.266
You know, I could be gay.

48:16.350 --> 48:18.302
I see through you completely.

48:18.769 --> 48:20.304
Oh, you see through me completely.

48:20.604 --> 48:21.305
Yeah, I do.

48:21.688 --> 48:22.806
That's the dark side of feminism.

48:23.307 --> 48:24.273
What?

48:24.308 --> 48:27.311
You have a kind of free pass
to make any kind of wounding

48:27.346 --> 48:28.812
Or derogatory comment you want.

48:29.313 --> 48:31.315
I am hardly a militant feminist.

48:31.350 --> 48:32.316
No, you're not.

48:32.816 --> 48:33.817
A militant feminist
would be a lot fairer.

48:34.117 --> 48:35.319
It's women like you
whose attitudes to men

48:35.652 --> 48:36.820
Are so dehumanizing.

48:37.154 --> 48:38.003
Like what?

48:38.038 --> 48:40.289
That men are swine,

48:40.324 --> 48:42.326
Obsessed with large breasts

48:42.361 --> 48:43.792
And the sex act,

48:43.827 --> 48:45.829
Devoid of any idealistic
or romantic sensibility

48:45.864 --> 48:46.795
When in fact,

48:46.830 --> 48:48.332
We have that idealistic sensibility

48:48.367 --> 48:49.333
In spades.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.300
For instance, you have no idea

48:51.335 --> 48:53.837
What men really think
about women's breasts.

48:53.872 --> 48:56.805
What do men think about women's breasts?

48:56.840 --> 48:59.367
Well, it's not something
you just blurt out.

48:59.402 --> 49:01.895
It's far more complicated
and nuanced than that.

49:06.350 --> 49:07.851
Ok, I'll tell you a story.

49:07.886 --> 49:09.318
When I was in college,

49:09.353 --> 49:10.604
There was a girl I had a crush on

49:10.639 --> 49:11.855
Who always had older boyfriends,

49:11.890 --> 49:12.821
Invariably some senior.

49:12.856 --> 49:14.323
Finally, they all graduated,

49:14.358 --> 49:16.860
And one night we went
back to her room alone.

49:16.895 --> 49:18.827
Suddenly, her shirt was off,

49:18.862 --> 49:21.330
And I was confronted with these breasts,

49:21.365 --> 49:22.866
Which turned out to be
completely surprising

49:23.367 --> 49:24.868
And frankly, disconcerting.

49:25.369 --> 49:28.505
They were rather large and not ugly

49:28.872 --> 49:30.339
Or especially strange-Shaped,

49:30.374 --> 49:32.876
But in all the time that
I had thought about her,

49:33.377 --> 49:35.379
These breasts had never figured.

49:35.629 --> 49:37.881
She took off her shirt so quickly,

49:38.014 --> 49:39.383
There was no time for adjustment,

49:39.883 --> 49:41.385
And I said something arrogant about it,

49:41.885 --> 49:44.388
As if her abrupt unveiling
of her largish breasts

49:44.888 --> 49:47.391
Was somehow going to
slay my swinish male self,

49:47.891 --> 49:49.393
As if I hadn't already been slayed

49:49.893 --> 49:51.611
On a much higher level.

49:53.397 --> 49:54.898
Her name was Alice, too.

49:55.399 --> 49:56.865
Oh, come on, des.

49:56.900 --> 49:57.901
You know that's not true.

49:58.235 --> 49:59.403
What do you mean, it isn't true?

49:59.703 --> 50:00.904
Her name wasn't Alice.

50:01.204 --> 50:03.373
Well, I'm not gonna use her real name.

50:03.408 --> 50:05.325
Would you like to dance?

50:07.077 --> 50:09.246

50:20.424 --> 50:23.393
If what's bothering you relates to Tom,

50:23.477 --> 50:24.928
I wouldn't take it personally.

50:25.429 --> 50:26.430
Did you know Tom and Jennifer

50:26.465 --> 50:28.199
Had a trial separation,

50:28.234 --> 50:29.933
Which was to end tonight?

50:31.268 --> 50:32.436
What you might not know

50:32.936 --> 50:33.937
Is that about a week ago,

50:34.438 --> 50:36.940
They started seeing
each other on the sly,

50:37.324 --> 50:40.444
Cheating on their trial separation.

50:40.944 --> 50:42.446
How do you know that?

50:42.913 --> 50:43.447
Working at the club,

50:43.947 --> 50:44.948
You find out all kinds of things.

50:45.449 --> 50:46.450
You know, this is the way
people used to dance in bars

50:46.950 --> 50:47.451
In the old days.

50:47.951 --> 50:49.453
Do people ever really dance in bars?

50:49.953 --> 50:51.455
I thought that was a myth.

50:51.955 --> 50:53.957
People my older brother's
age, uh, they did.

50:54.458 --> 50:55.959
Your brother must be a lot older.

50:56.460 --> 50:56.960
Before disco,

50:57.461 --> 50:58.962
This country was a dancing wasteland.

50:59.463 --> 51:00.964
You know the woodstock
generation of the 1960s

51:01.465 --> 51:02.466
That were so full of themselves

51:02.966 --> 51:03.467
And conceited?

51:03.967 --> 51:05.469
None of those people could dance.

51:19.733 --> 51:21.485
What happened over there?

51:21.651 --> 51:22.451
I think she noticed

51:22.486 --> 51:24.237
That, for a moment, I flinched.

51:24.272 --> 51:25.989
She dropped me like a rock.

51:26.024 --> 51:27.956
I was crushed.

51:27.991 --> 51:30.459
I couldn't take it, so I dropped out

51:30.494 --> 51:32.496
And got in the night
club business early,

51:32.996 --> 51:33.497
Thanks to which

51:33.997 --> 51:35.499
I probably owe my success today.

51:35.632 --> 51:36.500
Let's share a cab.

51:36.535 --> 51:37.501
We're thinking of going.

51:37.536 --> 51:39.002
You're all going?

51:39.037 --> 51:39.968
Yeah.

51:40.003 --> 51:41.505
Have they called yet from the club?

51:42.005 --> 51:42.506
I don't think they will call.

51:43.006 --> 51:44.007
Bernie will probably send some emissary.

51:44.042 --> 51:44.973
That's more his style.

51:45.008 --> 51:46.760
What should we do with the oz costumes,

51:46.795 --> 51:48.512
Just, uh, bring 'em
by the club tomorrow?

51:48.547 --> 51:50.031
Actually, those costumes are mine.

51:50.066 --> 51:51.541
Just get 'em back to me when you can.

51:51.576 --> 51:52.981
I thought we were here as a group.

51:53.016 --> 51:55.018
You talked about the
tremendous importance

51:55.053 --> 51:56.537
Of group social life.

51:56.572 --> 51:57.986
Well, it's really late.

51:58.021 --> 51:59.523
Yeah, Alice, it's getting really late.

51:59.558 --> 52:00.524
We'd better get going.

52:01.024 --> 52:02.025
Hey, thanks again, des.

52:02.060 --> 52:03.043
Ciao.

52:03.078 --> 52:04.053
Bye.

52:04.088 --> 52:05.028
Bye.

52:06.029 --> 52:07.496
All week charlotte's been talking about

52:07.531 --> 52:10.033
The tremendous importance
of group social life,

52:10.068 --> 52:12.303
Opposing all this ferocious pairing off.

52:12.338 --> 52:14.538
Well, group social life has its place,

52:14.573 --> 52:15.504
But at a certain point,

52:15.539 --> 52:18.041
Other biological factors come into play.

52:18.542 --> 52:19.543
Our bodies weren't really designed

52:19.578 --> 52:21.510
For group social life.

52:21.545 --> 52:23.011
A certain amount of pairing off

52:23.046 --> 52:24.548
Was always part of the original plan.

52:24.881 --> 52:26.049
God, I can't believe you'd say that.

52:26.084 --> 52:27.015
What?

52:27.050 --> 52:28.517
What did I say?

52:28.552 --> 52:30.554
What you mean to say is
that they've all gone back

52:30.589 --> 52:31.555
To screw their brains out?!

52:31.590 --> 52:32.521
No, I didn't say that!

52:32.556 --> 52:33.557
I said they were going to pair off.

52:34.057 --> 52:35.559
Well, wait, don't go!

52:36.026 --> 52:37.294
I didn't mean to say anything

52:37.329 --> 52:38.946
Anyone could be offended by.

52:38.981 --> 52:40.529
Oh, thank god. He's here.

52:40.564 --> 52:42.531
Des, Bernie regrets what happened.

52:42.566 --> 52:44.067
It was a mistake, and he wants you back.

52:44.401 --> 52:48.071
I'm sorry. I know why you're so upset.

52:48.106 --> 52:49.037
I mean,

52:49.072 --> 52:50.574
I know what really happened with Tom.

52:51.074 --> 52:51.575
What?!

52:52.075 --> 52:52.576
That he thought

52:53.076 --> 52:54.077
You were really slutty or something.

52:54.578 --> 52:56.079
That's so stupid!

52:58.081 --> 53:01.084
You can't worry about
what misinterpreters think!

53:01.119 --> 53:02.551
That's so unfair!

53:02.586 --> 53:04.588
Come back to my place. We should talk.

53:04.623 --> 53:06.054
Nothing will happen!

53:06.089 --> 53:07.591
I just need somebody to talk to.

53:07.626 --> 53:09.059
Maybe you do, too.

53:10.594 --> 53:12.596
89th and first.

53:20.804 --> 53:22.789
89th and first.

53:24.290 --> 53:25.792

53:56.357 --> 53:57.789
If you could publish any book?

53:57.824 --> 53:59.325
Anything that might become a bestseller.

53:59.742 --> 54:02.161
Aside from that. Your dream book.

54:03.329 --> 54:06.332
I'd say... a collection of
new J.D. Salinger stories,

54:06.833 --> 54:08.835
But more in the direction
of the laughing man

54:09.085 --> 54:11.337

54:11.471 --> 54:13.840

An introduction.

54:13.923 --> 54:15.842
Did you know that, in his own day,

54:16.342 --> 54:17.844
Mary McCarthy and Alfred Kazin

54:18.344 --> 54:20.346
Wrote devastating pieces on Salinger?

54:20.480 --> 54:21.347
No.

Yeah. They really destroyed him.

55:06.225 --> 55:08.728
Get out! Get out!

55:11.698 --> 55:12.699
That was pretty bad.

55:12.734 --> 55:13.950
God!

55:30.717 --> 55:33.136
What's the matter now?

55:33.171 --> 55:34.087
What?

55:34.170 --> 55:35.603
All the
noise...

55:35.638 --> 55:37.590
Clomping around, banging pans.

55:37.674 --> 55:39.142
Sorry. I didn't realize it.

55:39.309 --> 55:40.643
You obviously intended it.

55:40.927 --> 55:42.645
What do you mean?

55:43.096 --> 55:44.147
That's very aggressive.

55:44.647 --> 55:45.648
You don't clomp around, banging pans

55:45.683 --> 55:46.649
For no reason.

55:47.066 --> 55:48.151
Like what reason?

55:48.518 --> 55:50.586
You know perfectly well.

55:50.621 --> 55:52.655
Because I only bang pans?

55:55.158 --> 55:58.411
Well, frankly, that's not what I heard.

56:12.175 --> 56:14.177
Ok. Anything I did that was wrong,

56:14.212 --> 56:15.628
I apologize for.

56:15.712 --> 56:18.181
But anything I did that was not wrong,

56:18.216 --> 56:19.349
I don't apologize for.

56:22.685 --> 56:25.938
God, Alice is such a scorpio.

56:41.704 --> 56:43.456

56:43.491 --> 56:45.208

Shame on you!

57:11.769 --> 57:13.236
Bitch!

57:13.319 --> 57:14.528
I've decided to go ahead

57:14.563 --> 57:15.738
With the Tibet book proposal.

57:16.189 --> 57:17.205
What?

57:17.240 --> 57:19.242
The memoir by the Dalai
lama's older brother?

57:19.277 --> 57:20.743
Oh.

57:21.110 --> 57:22.210
I'd like to bring it up

57:22.245 --> 57:23.746
At Wednesday's editorial meeting.

57:23.946 --> 57:26.249
You really liked that?

57:26.332 --> 57:27.750
Other people liked it, too?

57:28.251 --> 57:30.119
Yeah.

57:32.255 --> 57:33.923
Ok. I'll take another look.

57:35.258 --> 57:37.260
You know, it's considered
a little self-Indulgent

57:37.295 --> 57:38.726
To read too much of a manuscript

57:38.761 --> 57:41.264
If it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

57:41.299 --> 57:44.232
Have you known holly long?

57:44.267 --> 57:46.269
Just since we found the apartment. Why?

57:46.304 --> 57:48.789
She's very, uh...

57:48.824 --> 57:51.239
quiet, isn't she?

57:51.274 --> 57:53.276
Well, I would say, not more than normal.

57:53.776 --> 57:56.279
Your standard of normal could
be different from other people's.

57:56.314 --> 57:58.281
How do you mean?

57:59.782 --> 58:01.284
I don't understand that.

58:01.784 --> 58:03.285
I guess what
I'm asking is...

58:03.320 --> 58:04.787
You do like holly, don't you?

58:04.822 --> 58:06.254
Yeah, of course.

58:06.289 --> 58:09.292
But... she is intelligent, isn't she?

58:09.327 --> 58:10.793
Well, sometimes I question

58:10.828 --> 58:12.312
Her dating choices.

58:12.347 --> 58:13.761
God, you're tough.

58:13.796 --> 58:15.798
I'm not tough in the least.

Charlotte. Oh, charlotte.

58:42.024 --> 58:42.790
That was so moving,

58:42.825 --> 58:44.327
What you said about our
obligation to writers.

58:44.443 --> 58:45.328
Thanks.

58:45.411 --> 58:46.829
And how often we fall short of that.

58:47.280 --> 58:48.296
Well, let's face it,

58:48.331 --> 58:50.333
Most authors are still conceited dopes.

58:50.500 --> 58:52.835
Oh, you... You
can't say that.

58:53.035 --> 58:54.302
You're an editor.

58:54.337 --> 58:55.838
You don't have to deal
with them on a daily basis.

58:56.255 --> 58:57.340
When you're an assistant,

58:57.707 --> 58:59.342
It's harder to dodge their calls.

58:59.458 --> 59:00.808
Good going, Alice.

59:00.843 --> 59:02.310
I'm really glad we got this book.

59:02.345 --> 59:05.348
I understand that you know
some people at the club.

59:05.383 --> 59:07.315
Do you think that maybe, um,

59:07.350 --> 59:09.352
Sometime you could, uh,
get us in there some night?

59:09.852 --> 59:11.354
Yeah. Certainly. We'll arrange that.

59:11.389 --> 59:12.855
Very good. Thanks.

59:15.858 --> 59:16.859
Thanks a lot, Dan.

59:17.360 --> 59:17.860
Sure.

59:18.361 --> 59:20.328
Do you have any idea why Jimmy's

59:20.363 --> 59:21.864
Suddenly so interested
in your social life?

59:21.899 --> 59:23.866
No. He's interested in my social life?

59:24.367 --> 59:25.868
Haven't you noticed?
He's always wondering

59:25.903 --> 59:27.370
Why you don't go out or go to the club.

59:27.820 --> 59:28.371
He is?

59:28.871 --> 59:29.620
You know, Alice,

59:29.655 --> 59:31.374
You've been hanging
around the apartment a lot.

59:31.490 --> 59:33.876
You've kind of set up office there.

59:34.327 --> 59:36.829
None of the rest of us has any privacy.

59:36.913 --> 59:38.397
The railroad apartment wasn't my idea.

59:38.432 --> 59:39.908
Yeah, that's true, but it's just odd

59:39.943 --> 59:41.384
That you're so much friendlier to Jimmy

59:41.419 --> 59:42.385
Now he's with me.

59:42.468 --> 59:45.388
I just think the
situation's kind of awkward.

59:46.422 --> 59:47.355
What do you want me to do,

59:47.390 --> 59:48.891
Promise not to talk to him anymore?

59:48.975 --> 59:49.892
I'm sure you know perfectly well

59:50.393 --> 59:51.394
How to subtly get a guy to cool it

59:51.894 --> 59:52.895

Oh, damn? Thanks.

You're here to see van?

You don't mind, do ya?

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:16.620
Well, I sorta do.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.122
I hate asking that guy for favors.

01:00:19.255 --> 01:00:20.690
They're not gonna keep me on much longer

01:00:20.725 --> 01:00:22.125
If I can't get clients into the club.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.627
It's that important to you

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.095
To stay in advertising?

01:00:26.596 --> 01:00:30.100
Ok. Better see him while
he's still on his upswing.

01:00:34.604 --> 01:00:36.106
Hey, des.

01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:37.522
Hi.

01:00:37.557 --> 01:00:38.583
God, what happened to you?

01:00:38.618 --> 01:00:39.609
Jesus. Josh, you're a mess.

01:00:39.644 --> 01:00:41.076
I'm a mess.

01:00:41.111 --> 01:00:42.077
I got to talk to you.

01:00:42.112 --> 01:00:44.614
You sure you don't want
to clean up a little?

01:00:44.649 --> 01:00:46.081
It's kind of serious.

01:00:46.116 --> 01:00:47.617
I'll look for Alice and charlotte,

01:00:47.652 --> 01:00:49.119
See if they've come in.

01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:57.092
That's Audrey Rouget,

01:00:57.127 --> 01:00:59.129
The youngest person
ever to be made an editor

01:00:59.164 --> 01:01:01.631
In the history of farrar, Straus.

01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:03.400
How do you know her?

01:01:03.435 --> 01:01:05.135
She interviewed me.

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:06.801
How did it go?

01:01:06.836 --> 01:01:08.687
Have you ever been in an interview

01:01:08.722 --> 01:01:11.141
And gotten the impression they
see through you completely?

01:01:13.643 --> 01:01:15.145
I didn't get an offer.

01:01:16.146 --> 01:01:18.148
You don't want to clean up a little?

01:01:18.183 --> 01:01:19.114
No.

01:01:19.149 --> 01:01:20.650
You know, you look really bad.

01:01:21.151 --> 01:01:22.902
I know. That's actually good in my work.

01:01:22.937 --> 01:01:24.654
It puts people at
ease, looking like this.

01:01:25.155 --> 01:01:26.621
They feel, frankly, superior to me

01:01:26.656 --> 01:01:28.658
And say things they ordinarily wouldn't.

01:01:28.693 --> 01:01:30.928
It's very disarming.

01:01:30.963 --> 01:01:32.563
Phew! What happened?!

01:01:32.598 --> 01:01:34.129
I was having drinks

01:01:34.164 --> 01:01:35.165
With some friends in the village,

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.183
And there was this terrible guy

01:01:36.218 --> 01:01:37.193
Really bothering this girl,

01:01:37.228 --> 01:01:38.168
So I decided to intervene,

01:01:38.668 --> 01:01:40.169
But it turns out they were married.

01:01:40.204 --> 01:01:41.688
What's this now? You're not here

01:01:41.723 --> 01:01:43.138
On official business, are you?

01:01:43.173 --> 01:01:44.674
Knowing that we went
to college together,

01:01:44.709 --> 01:01:46.176
They asked me to talk to you.

01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:48.153
Who is "they"?

01:01:48.188 --> 01:01:50.061
I can't tell you.

01:01:50.096 --> 01:01:51.598
I couldn't believe you'd be involved

01:01:52.098 --> 01:01:52.599
In the kinds of things

01:01:53.099 --> 01:01:53.600
That have been going on here

01:01:53.635 --> 01:01:55.567
And told them so.

01:01:55.602 --> 01:01:57.604
I consider you a person
of some integrity,

01:01:57.639 --> 01:01:59.070
Except, you know,

01:01:59.105 --> 01:02:00.607

No, I don't want to play that stuff.

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:41.062
All right. I'll let him know.

01:02:41.097 --> 01:02:42.098
Take the tortoise and the hare.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:43.600
Ok, the tortoise won one race.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.793
Do you think the hare
is really gonna lose

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.487
Any more races to
turtles? Not on your life.

01:02:47.522 --> 01:02:49.070
I liked that tortoise.

01:02:49.105 --> 01:02:51.072
So do I, but if you
were a betting person,

01:02:51.107 --> 01:02:53.610
Would you say, "that
tortoise won against the hare.

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:55.076
In future races I'm backing him"?

01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:56.578
No. That race was
almost certainly a fluke,

01:02:56.613 --> 01:02:57.614
And, afterwards, the
tortoise is still a tortoise,

01:02:58.114 --> 01:02:59.365
And the hare, a hare.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.509
Domestic beer. A bud.

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:01.831
Mm-Hmm.

01:03:01.866 --> 01:03:03.084
Vodka tonic, please.

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:06.623
Um, I'll just have a coca-Cola.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.458
You're not drinking?

01:03:10.126 --> 01:03:12.128
Alice is not having a cocktail?

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:13.630
I can't believe it.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.131
Well, I'm not.

01:03:15.632 --> 01:03:16.598
What is it?

01:03:16.633 --> 01:03:18.635
Do you have strep throat or some flu

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.603
You're taking antibiotics for?

01:03:22.856 --> 01:03:25.141
Oh, my god! You have
the clap, don't you?

01:03:25.475 --> 01:03:26.608
You're on antibiotics,

01:03:26.643 --> 01:03:28.645
And the doctor told you not to drink

01:03:28.862 --> 01:03:29.611
Or something.

01:03:29.646 --> 01:03:31.147
That's why you're not drinking.

01:03:31.531 --> 01:03:33.650
Usually there's no coming between Alice

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:34.835
And a cocktail.

01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:35.985
How could you?

01:03:38.154 --> 01:03:39.656
No. I'm sure I'm right.

01:03:40.156 --> 01:03:41.658
The bottle of tetracycline

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.124
On her bureau top.

01:03:43.159 --> 01:03:45.161
Tetracycline's specific for the clap.

01:03:45.662 --> 01:03:47.128
How could you say that?!

01:03:47.163 --> 01:03:50.250

01:04:11.571 --> 01:04:14.155
I am so, so sorry.

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:16.192
I should never have said that.

01:04:16.693 --> 01:04:18.194
I have some sort of sick compulsion

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:19.696
To say everything that occurs to me.

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:20.662
I just want to let you know,

01:04:20.697 --> 01:04:22.198
As soon as I can find
a new rooming situation,

01:04:22.699 --> 01:04:24.701
I'm moving out. I can't take it anymore.

01:04:25.001 --> 01:04:26.669
It's not possible.

01:04:26.704 --> 01:04:28.338
You're not serious.

01:04:29.205 --> 01:04:31.207
Just let me know when
you're ready to go.

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.208
Ok.

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:35.211
Please, Alice.

01:04:35.428 --> 01:04:36.177
Rooming with you and holly

01:04:36.212 --> 01:04:37.213
Has been the most important thing

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:38.715
To happen to me in my life.

01:04:39.215 --> 01:04:42.218
You're the first woman
friends I've ever had.

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:44.185
The anger you're feeling now

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.723
Is actually more
justified than you know.

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:48.224
When we were at Hampshire,

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.726
I really hated you.

01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:51.728
You seemed so moralistic and judgmental.

01:04:52.228 --> 01:04:55.732
I had no idea, then,
how you really were.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:57.233
When guys wanted to ask you out,

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:58.735
I'd talk them out of it.

01:04:59.235 --> 01:05:01.738
Oh, my god. I can't
believe how evil I was.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.204
But I've completely changed.

01:05:03.239 --> 01:05:04.205
If you will give me another chance,

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.207
I'll be the best friend you've ever had.

01:05:06.242 --> 01:05:08.244
If the apartment situation
weren't so impossible,

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:09.210
I'd move out now.

01:05:09.245 --> 01:05:11.748
I can understand how
you'd feel that way.

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:13.214
You're right to.

01:05:13.249 --> 01:05:15.216
But things aren't always as they seem.

01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:17.754
Bad and inexcusable as
what I said back there

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.022
Might have been, I think you'll find

01:05:19.057 --> 01:05:20.256
It'll actually improve your reputation

01:05:20.757 --> 01:05:21.758
With these guys enormously.

01:05:21.975 --> 01:05:24.761
You'll be more popular than ever. Watch.

01:05:24.928 --> 01:05:26.227
Vd's not all bad.

01:05:26.262 --> 01:05:28.264
You'll find there are actually

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:29.265
Positive aspects to it.

01:05:29.766 --> 01:05:30.732
What?

01:05:30.767 --> 01:05:32.769
Well, you know that "please inform

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:34.288
All previous partners" thing?

01:05:34.323 --> 01:05:35.772
It's actually a terrific way

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:36.738
To get back in touch

01:05:36.773 --> 01:05:38.024
With guys you might have liked

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:39.275
But have lost contact with.

01:05:39.776 --> 01:05:40.777
Just in my own experience,

01:05:41.277 --> 01:05:42.278
It's twice led to renewed relationships

01:05:42.779 --> 01:05:44.280
With guys that lasted quite a while

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:46.282
And were really... sweet.

01:05:46.616 --> 01:05:48.284
I'm not talking about herpes infections,

01:05:48.785 --> 01:05:50.286
Which are far more serious

01:05:50.787 --> 01:05:51.788
And apparently incurable,

01:05:52.288 --> 01:05:53.789
Just standard vd and other conditions

01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:55.291
Easily treatable with antibiotics.

01:06:05.018 --> 01:06:07.770
God, are you following me or something?

01:06:08.805 --> 01:06:10.807
You said you weren't taking anything.

01:06:11.107 --> 01:06:12.809
Well, I'm not. It was a gift.

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.310
I never buy the stuff,

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:15.812
And anyway, it hardly affects me.

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:16.813
Oh, no.

01:06:17.063 --> 01:06:18.189
Actually, what I'm high about

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.280
Is the situation with Alice.

01:06:19.315 --> 01:06:20.817
This makes her seem
much more accessible.

01:06:21.317 --> 01:06:22.819
She's not operating on a plane

01:06:23.236 --> 01:06:24.821
So far removed from the rest of us.

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:26.789
There's hope for me.

01:06:29.325 --> 01:06:32.328
What did josh want to talk to you about?

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:34.295
Is everything ok?

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:37.834
Uh, no... not exactly.

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:41.838
I'm sorry to bug you about this,

01:06:42.338 --> 01:06:43.339
But I'd be really grateful

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.807
If we could talk with van soon.

01:06:45.842 --> 01:06:48.344
The way it's going, if I
can't get people in here,

01:06:48.845 --> 01:06:50.346
I'm going to lose my job.

01:06:50.847 --> 01:06:53.349
Des! You lied to me!

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.852
I thought you were a wonderful man,

01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:57.854
But it was all lies!

01:06:57.987 --> 01:06:58.820
No!

01:06:58.855 --> 01:07:00.321
You said you loved me!

01:07:00.356 --> 01:07:02.358
And then you said you were gay,

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.860
But you're not!

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:06.327
Everyone knew but me!

01:07:06.362 --> 01:07:08.364
You completely humiliated me!

01:07:08.664 --> 01:07:10.832
I could be gay.

01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:13.870
You're saying again you're gay?

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.837
Tell me honestly,

01:07:15.872 --> 01:07:19.674
Have you had sex with men?!

01:07:19.709 --> 01:07:22.378
♪♪ I got to go where
the people dance... ♪♪

01:07:22.879 --> 01:07:25.381
Well, that's defining
it rather narrowly.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.384
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:07:28.768 --> 01:07:29.886
Bullshit!

01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:41.031
Between games, as planned,

01:07:41.364 --> 01:07:43.533
A huge box containing
thousands of disco records

01:07:44.034 --> 01:07:45.035
Was blown up.

01:07:58.548 --> 01:08:00.050
The rest was unplanned.

01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:02.552
Fans stormed out onto the
field in the thousands.

01:08:03.002 --> 01:08:05.055
Disco records were hurled like frisbees.

01:08:05.221 --> 01:08:07.522
Bonfires were set. Bottles where thrown.

01:08:07.557 --> 01:08:10.060
The batting cage was
torn down and destroyed.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.561
Fistfights broke out.

01:08:17.567 --> 01:08:20.069
Manhattan district
attorney Robert Morgenthau,

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:21.486
At his press conference,

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.075
Congratulated prosecutors on
their successful convictions

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:27.577
In the probe of...

01:08:27.743 --> 01:08:30.080
...speaking for the first time
on his real estate task force's

01:08:30.115 --> 01:08:33.582
18 convictions of executives
at 6 commercial brokerages,

01:08:33.618 --> 01:08:35.352
Promised a vigorous prosecution

01:08:35.386 --> 01:08:37.051
Of corporate and white collar crime

01:08:37.087 --> 01:08:39.589
In a wide-Ranging series
of investigations...

01:09:04.613 --> 01:09:07.117
I'll just be a second.

01:09:32.142 --> 01:09:34.644
Alice, congratulations on the TV sale.

01:09:34.679 --> 01:09:35.645
Thanks.

01:09:37.147 --> 01:09:38.398
Hi.

01:09:38.433 --> 01:09:39.649
Hi.

01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:41.151
How's holly?

01:09:41.651 --> 01:09:42.152
Fine.

01:09:42.652 --> 01:09:45.620
Is she, um, going out with anyone?

01:09:45.654 --> 01:09:48.658
Yeah, this really nice guy
who went to Denver university

01:09:49.158 --> 01:09:50.160
And works in real estate.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.162
He found her this
incredibly cheap apartment.

01:09:52.662 --> 01:09:55.415
She no longer lives with you guys?

01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:58.168
You hold what happened against me.

01:09:58.203 --> 01:09:59.634
Not that you broke up,

01:09:59.669 --> 01:10:01.171
Just that you go out with people

01:10:01.206 --> 01:10:02.940
Based primarily on looks.

01:10:02.975 --> 01:10:04.575
Holly's also very nice.

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.141
A lot of people are nice.

01:10:06.176 --> 01:10:09.179
You only asked out the
fabulously good-Looking one.

01:10:09.462 --> 01:10:11.181
You hold that against me.

01:10:11.514 --> 01:10:12.647
Well, pretty shallow.

01:10:12.682 --> 01:10:15.185
You know, Alice, except for politics,

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.704
We've got a lot in common.

01:10:16.739 --> 01:10:18.153
We're both pretty serious

01:10:18.188 --> 01:10:20.690
And, I think, respect each other's

01:10:20.725 --> 01:10:21.691
Bases for judgment.

01:10:22.192 --> 01:10:22.692
Occasionally,

01:10:23.193 --> 01:10:24.694
I get reactionary thoughts, too.

01:10:24.729 --> 01:10:26.463
I'm not reactionary.

01:10:26.498 --> 01:10:28.599
Well, aesthetically.

01:10:28.634 --> 01:10:30.700
Oh, well, aesthetically.

01:10:37.707 --> 01:10:40.877
You mean you think I gave it to you?

01:10:42.212 --> 01:10:44.214
How can you be sure?

01:10:44.249 --> 01:10:46.181
I'm sure.

01:10:46.216 --> 01:10:51.221
Well, you were a lot
more active than I was.

01:10:51.256 --> 01:10:55.225
You were obviously very experienced.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.191
No.

01:10:56.226 --> 01:10:57.692
Oh, come on.

01:10:57.727 --> 01:11:00.230
How did you know all that?

01:11:00.265 --> 01:11:02.732
Well, I read a lot.

01:11:03.733 --> 01:11:06.236
You must've been with some guys.

01:11:06.271 --> 01:11:09.204
You weren't a virgin.

01:11:09.239 --> 01:11:13.743
I didn't consider myself a virgin,

01:11:13.778 --> 01:11:14.744
But...

01:11:16.246 --> 01:11:17.247
what?

01:11:18.248 --> 01:11:19.749
I don't know.

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:21.251
Technically...

01:11:24.254 --> 01:11:25.204
what?

01:11:25.288 --> 01:11:27.523
If I'm making love,

01:11:27.558 --> 01:11:29.659
The man... spurts...

01:11:29.694 --> 01:11:31.726
outside the woman,

01:11:31.761 --> 01:11:34.764
Does that count as sexual intercourse?

01:11:34.799 --> 01:11:36.266
"Spurts"?

01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:41.521
If it squirts outside,
without getting in,

01:11:41.556 --> 01:11:45.417
Does that count as
losing your virginity?

01:11:45.452 --> 01:11:49.279
No part of the man got in at any time?

01:11:49.314 --> 01:11:53.248
I don't think so.

01:11:53.283 --> 01:11:58.253
I think part has to get in...

01:11:58.288 --> 01:12:00.790
to be considered sexual intercourse.

01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:04.794
So then I was a virgin.

01:12:04.829 --> 01:12:07.297
Oh... I can't believe that.

01:12:09.299 --> 01:12:11.766
The first time
you make love, I...

01:12:11.801 --> 01:12:16.806
I give you both "g"
and an "h" infection.

01:12:17.056 --> 01:12:18.808
"H"?

01:12:26.816 --> 01:12:27.732
Your move.

01:12:27.767 --> 01:12:30.785
I'm beginning to think that maybe

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.822
That old system of
people getting married

01:12:33.323 --> 01:12:35.325
Based on mutual respect
and shared aspirations,

01:12:35.825 --> 01:12:36.826
And then slowly, over time,

01:12:37.327 --> 01:12:38.828
Earning each other's
love and admiration,

01:12:39.329 --> 01:12:40.795
Worked the best.

01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.332
Well, we'll never know.

01:12:42.367 --> 01:12:43.333
Almost ready.

01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:45.335
God, waiting around all night

01:12:45.835 --> 01:12:48.588
For the unemployed guy
to get around to shaving.

01:12:48.623 --> 01:12:51.341
You're so busy you can't
shower until midnight?

01:12:51.376 --> 01:12:54.344
Excuse me. Unemployed is not who I am.

01:12:54.379 --> 01:12:55.810
I'm a fully-Employed person

01:12:55.845 --> 01:12:58.097
Who just happens not
to have a job right now,

01:12:58.132 --> 01:13:00.350
Largely because of
some structural problems

01:13:00.385 --> 01:13:01.816
In the advertising industry.

01:13:01.851 --> 01:13:03.853
I'm sorry. That was
really inconsiderate.

01:13:03.888 --> 01:13:05.855
Please forgive me.

01:13:07.857 --> 01:13:08.990
♪♪ Spin me ♪♪

01:13:09.025 --> 01:13:11.027
♪ ♪♪ All around the floor... ♪

01:13:12.528 --> 01:13:13.529
Of course, if
you talk enthusiastically

01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:15.031
About your work in advertising,

01:13:15.531 --> 01:13:16.532
You sound like a total cretin.

01:13:17.033 --> 01:13:18.284
No. Your enthusiasm

01:13:18.319 --> 01:13:20.178
Is actually enormously appealing.

01:13:20.213 --> 01:13:22.038
In fact, I used to not think so well

01:13:22.073 --> 01:13:23.539
Of people in advertising,

01:13:23.823 --> 01:13:25.006
But it's one of the great things

01:13:25.041 --> 01:13:27.543
About getting out of college
and into the real worid,

01:13:27.626 --> 01:13:30.546
How experience changes
and improves your views.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.013
During college, I
remember seeing couples

01:13:32.048 --> 01:13:35.051
With crying babies and
thinking "how horrible."

01:13:35.086 --> 01:13:37.053
Lately, I've been spending a lot of time

01:13:37.088 --> 01:13:38.054
With my niece and nephew.

01:13:38.554 --> 01:13:40.056
Saturday, I took my niece, who's 7,

01:13:40.172 --> 01:13:41.057
To see the Disney movie,

01:13:41.557 --> 01:13:43.059
Lady and the tramp. She loved it,

01:13:43.094 --> 01:13:44.525
Was so cute.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.527
I'm beginning to fall in love

01:13:46.562 --> 01:13:48.564
With the whole idea of having kids.

01:13:48.599 --> 01:13:49.833
I hate that movie.

01:13:49.868 --> 01:13:51.468
What?

01:13:51.503 --> 01:13:53.034
It's so... tacky,

01:13:53.069 --> 01:13:55.071
Not to mention depressing.

01:13:55.154 --> 01:13:58.074
This sweet movie about
cute cartoon dogs,

01:13:58.109 --> 01:13:59.075
You found depressing?

01:13:59.325 --> 01:14:01.410
There is something depressing about it.

01:14:01.445 --> 01:14:03.544
And it's not really about dogs.

01:14:03.579 --> 01:14:07.083
Except for some superficial
bow-Wow stuff at the start,

01:14:07.118 --> 01:14:09.050
The dogs all represent human types,

01:14:09.085 --> 01:14:10.586
Which is where it
gets into real trouble.

01:14:10.703 --> 01:14:12.646
Lady, the ostensible protagonist,

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:14.590
Is a fluffy blonde cocker spaniel

01:14:15.007 --> 01:14:16.557
With absolutely nothing on her brain.

01:14:16.592 --> 01:14:18.594
She's great-Looking,
but... Let's be honest...

01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:19.560
Incredibly insipid.

01:14:19.595 --> 01:14:22.098
Tramp, the love interest,

01:14:22.598 --> 01:14:25.101
Is a smarmy braggart of
the most obnoxious kind:

01:14:25.136 --> 01:14:27.103
An oily jailbird out for a piece of tail

01:14:27.603 --> 01:14:29.105
Or whatever he can get.

01:14:29.388 --> 01:14:30.071
Come on.

01:14:30.106 --> 01:14:31.607
No. He's a self-Confessed chicken thief

01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:32.608
And all-Around sleazeball.

01:14:33.109 --> 01:14:35.111
What's the function
of a film of this kind?

01:14:35.611 --> 01:14:36.612
Essentially, it's a
primer on love and marriage

01:14:37.113 --> 01:14:38.079
Directed at very young people,

01:14:38.114 --> 01:14:40.116
Imprinting on their
little psyches the idea

01:14:40.151 --> 01:14:41.117
That smooth-Talking delinquents

01:14:41.617 --> 01:14:42.618
Recently escaped from the local pound

01:14:43.119 --> 01:14:45.121
Are a good match for nice
giris from sheltered homes.

01:14:45.621 --> 01:14:47.123
When in 10 years, the icky human version

01:14:47.289 --> 01:14:49.125
Of tramp shows up around the house,

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.591
Their hormones will be racing,

01:14:50.626 --> 01:14:52.628
And no one'll understand
why. Films like this

01:14:52.663 --> 01:14:54.630
Program women to adore jerks.

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:56.632
God, you're nuts.

01:14:56.999 --> 01:14:58.099
The only sympathetic character,

01:14:58.134 --> 01:15:01.137
The little scotty who's so
loyal and concerned about lady,

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:03.139
Is mocked as old-Fashioned
and irrelevant

01:15:03.174 --> 01:15:04.605
And shunted off to the side.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.142
Isn't the whole point
that tramp changes?

01:15:07.177 --> 01:15:09.645
Ok, maybe in the past he stole chickens,

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.147
Ran around without a license,

01:15:11.263 --> 01:15:12.148
And wasn't always sincere

01:15:12.648 --> 01:15:14.149
With members of the opposite sex.

01:15:14.184 --> 01:15:15.918
But through his love for lady

01:15:15.953 --> 01:15:17.618
And the beneficent influences

01:15:17.653 --> 01:15:20.656
Of fatherhood and
matrimony, he changes...

01:15:20.691 --> 01:15:23.927
and becomes a valued member of that,

01:15:23.962 --> 01:15:27.163
You know, rather idyllic household.

01:15:27.279 --> 01:15:29.046
I don't think people
really change that way.

01:15:29.081 --> 01:15:32.168
We can change our context,
but we can't change ourselves.

01:15:32.368 --> 01:15:33.269
What does that mean?

01:15:33.304 --> 01:15:34.170
Well, you've changed.

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:35.171
Come on, des.

01:15:35.621 --> 01:15:37.173
That's a little different.

01:15:37.208 --> 01:15:38.639
I agree with josh.

01:15:38.674 --> 01:15:40.676
The scotty is the only
admirable character.

01:15:40.876 --> 01:15:43.179
It would have been a much better movie

01:15:43.214 --> 01:15:45.181
If lady'd ended up with him.

01:15:45.514 --> 01:15:46.647
I'm really surprised.

01:15:46.682 --> 01:15:48.649
I think tramp really changed.

01:15:48.684 --> 01:15:50.686
Maybe he wanted to
change, or tried to change,

01:15:50.721 --> 01:15:52.455
But there's not a lot
of integrity there.

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:54.190
First, he'd be hanging around the house,

01:15:54.225 --> 01:15:55.656
Drinking and watching ball games

01:15:55.691 --> 01:15:57.693
And maybe knocking lady around a bit,

01:15:57.728 --> 01:15:59.160
But pretty soon he'll be back

01:15:59.195 --> 01:16:00.696
Down at the town dump chasing tail.

01:16:00.731 --> 01:16:01.662
Oh, give me a break.

01:16:01.697 --> 01:16:03.198
Are you taking your medication,

01:16:03.233 --> 01:16:04.717
'Cause what you're saying is

01:16:04.752 --> 01:16:06.202
Completely nuts! God, des...

01:16:06.402 --> 01:16:07.668
no! I think people should know

01:16:07.703 --> 01:16:09.705
That our friend here
has a certain condition.

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.207
How can Morgenthau shut up! Employ you?

01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.100
He knows about mass. Mental health

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.710
And the loony tunes junior year?

01:16:15.077 --> 01:16:17.830
Of course he knows about it.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:18.714
God!

01:16:28.057 --> 01:16:29.391
Jimmy, do you know where Alice is?

01:16:29.426 --> 01:16:30.726
No. I don't know where she is.

01:16:30.761 --> 01:16:32.228
Uh, excuse me.

01:16:32.478 --> 01:16:34.230
Were you at Leo Burnett in Chicago?

01:16:34.265 --> 01:16:35.749
Oh, my god, how are you?

01:16:35.784 --> 01:16:37.009
Um, do you know betty?

01:16:37.044 --> 01:16:38.234
Jimmy Steinway, hi.

01:16:38.269 --> 01:16:39.200
Hi.

01:16:39.235 --> 01:16:40.701
Are you still with ishmoco?

01:16:40.736 --> 01:16:42.238
Yeah. There's a sales
conference at the Americana.

01:16:42.738 --> 01:16:44.740
I'm actually with the
international side now,

01:16:44.775 --> 01:16:45.741
Based in Spain.

01:16:46.025 --> 01:16:46.742
How's that?

01:16:47.243 --> 01:16:48.209
Barcelona's beautiful,

01:16:48.244 --> 01:16:50.746
But, in human terms, uh, pretty cold.

01:16:50.913 --> 01:16:51.712
How 'bout you?

01:16:51.747 --> 01:16:53.749
I was at Mccallum, but just got sacked.

01:16:53.916 --> 01:16:55.251
Have you found anything else?

01:16:55.701 --> 01:16:56.252
No.

01:16:56.752 --> 01:16:57.253
Any leads?

01:16:57.753 --> 01:16:58.719
No.

01:16:58.754 --> 01:17:00.756
You know, there're a
lot of agencies in Spain

01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:02.758
Looking for people with
experience from here.

01:17:02.841 --> 01:17:04.225
There's one in Madrid

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.761
Some Burnett people
have affiliated with.

01:17:05.796 --> 01:17:07.263
I could give 'em a call.

01:17:07.346 --> 01:17:09.765
That sounds great.

01:17:09.848 --> 01:17:11.058
Michael.

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.268
Good times.

01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:16.272
I don't identify with tramp at all.

01:17:16.307 --> 01:17:17.773
I was just sticking up for him

01:17:17.808 --> 01:17:19.275
Because no one else was.

01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:20.241
I actually identify

01:17:20.276 --> 01:17:22.278
With the loyal scotty dog, too.

01:17:22.313 --> 01:17:23.279
I've changed.

I can't continue on this case.

There's a conflict.

01:18:27.843 --> 01:18:29.810
Well, we know that.

01:18:29.845 --> 01:18:32.848
You told us. You know this guy...

01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:35.351
That's ok.

01:18:35.851 --> 01:18:37.853

Hi. Hey.

01:18:55.871 --> 01:18:57.373
God, what a dump.

01:18:57.408 --> 01:18:58.374
Yeah.

01:18:58.874 --> 01:19:00.376
No. I don't mean your place.

01:19:00.876 --> 01:19:01.377
Outside.

01:19:01.877 --> 01:19:02.378
Oh.

01:19:02.878 --> 01:19:04.380
You iron your own shirts?

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:07.383
Well, if I'm going to court,
I wear a laundry-Ironed shirt,

01:19:07.883 --> 01:19:09.385
But, otherwise, I do it myself.

01:19:09.885 --> 01:19:11.387
That's a great moment in life

01:19:11.887 --> 01:19:12.888
When you can start

01:19:13.389 --> 01:19:14.890
Sending all your shirts
out for laundering.

01:19:15.391 --> 01:19:16.892
At the agency, after my last promotion,

01:19:17.393 --> 01:19:18.394
I briefly had that.

01:19:18.894 --> 01:19:20.896
In any case, I doubt I'll
be working there much longer.

01:19:21.397 --> 01:19:21.897
What?

01:19:22.347 --> 01:19:23.899
I'm thinking of quitting.

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.366
You can't do that.

01:19:25.401 --> 01:19:26.867
Why not? What's it to you?

01:19:26.902 --> 01:19:28.404
You assured me if I helped you,

01:19:28.904 --> 01:19:30.406
You'd be around to protect des.

01:19:30.656 --> 01:19:32.408
Well, the situation's changed.

01:19:32.691 --> 01:19:34.410
How's it changed?

01:19:34.493 --> 01:19:35.911
I can't say.

01:19:36.412 --> 01:19:38.414
You can't say.

01:19:42.418 --> 01:19:46.422
Maybe des is more
involved than I thought.

01:19:46.457 --> 01:19:50.426
Or more involved with someone you know.

01:19:50.592 --> 01:19:51.892
That's a conflict, josh.

01:19:51.927 --> 01:19:55.931
I still can't believe Alice
is really serious about des.

01:19:56.131 --> 01:19:56.882
Why not?

01:19:57.433 --> 01:19:59.400
She seems smarter than that.

01:19:59.435 --> 01:20:01.186
That doesn't matter. There's something

01:20:01.221 --> 01:20:02.903
Deeply ingrained in human biology.

01:20:02.938 --> 01:20:06.442
Women prefer bad over
weak and indecisive

01:20:06.809 --> 01:20:07.943
And unemployed.

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.945
I don't know about that.

01:20:10.112 --> 01:20:11.447
You think they do
prefer weak, indecisive,

01:20:11.482 --> 01:20:12.781
And unemployed?

01:20:20.991 --> 01:20:23.424
Jimmy's terribly closed off now.

01:20:23.459 --> 01:20:26.462
His previous girlfriends
weren't very nice to him.

01:20:26.962 --> 01:20:28.464
I still think I'll be
able to break through

01:20:28.964 --> 01:20:30.916
To him emotionally at some point.

01:20:32.968 --> 01:20:33.934
Oh...

01:20:33.969 --> 01:20:35.971
Bernie wants to see you.

01:20:41.977 --> 01:20:43.944
Could you wait for me?

01:20:43.979 --> 01:20:44.945
Let's have breakfast together.

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:46.982
I have something I want
to talk to you about.

01:20:47.017 --> 01:20:47.948
Ok.

01:20:47.983 --> 01:20:49.450

Uh, Bernie, you wanted to see me?

01:21:06.537 --> 01:21:07.468
Yeah.

01:21:07.503 --> 01:21:09.004
Sometimes I get the impression

01:21:09.039 --> 01:21:10.506
You hardly know me, des.

01:21:10.541 --> 01:21:11.972
I care about ideas.

01:21:12.007 --> 01:21:14.475
I care about them a lot.

01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:16.477
Did you know that in college,

01:21:16.512 --> 01:21:19.515
My senior paper was on Ernest Hemingway?

01:21:21.517 --> 01:21:22.483
Thanks, baby.

01:21:22.518 --> 01:21:25.270
I'm not a nice person, des.

01:21:25.305 --> 01:21:28.023
But some things are important,

01:21:28.058 --> 01:21:29.990
Such as loyalty.

01:21:30.025 --> 01:21:32.528
Loyalty's not eyewash,
not like niceness.

01:21:32.563 --> 01:21:33.994
I've been loyal to you, des.

01:21:34.029 --> 01:21:36.532
I could've fired you, lots of times,

01:21:36.567 --> 01:21:37.498
But never did.

01:21:37.533 --> 01:21:39.500
Maybe you're not aware of this, des,

01:21:39.535 --> 01:21:42.037
But there's some sort of
investigation underway.

01:21:42.072 --> 01:21:45.040
I think to myself,
"how could this happen?

01:21:45.075 --> 01:21:47.042
"How could they get this information?

01:21:47.077 --> 01:21:48.811
"Has some disgruntled employee,

01:21:48.846 --> 01:21:50.446
"Former or current, informed on us?

01:21:50.481 --> 01:21:52.015
"Is there some sort of spy here?

01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:53.549
How could agents even get in?"

01:21:53.584 --> 01:21:54.965
I mean, really,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.527
They would stand out in this crowd

01:21:57.562 --> 01:22:00.055
And, normally, not get past the door.

01:22:02.057 --> 01:22:04.024
Do you know how they got in?

01:22:04.059 --> 01:22:07.312
Uh, no. Could van be letting them in?

01:22:07.347 --> 01:22:10.566
They're coming in as ad agency clients.

01:22:10.601 --> 01:22:11.532
What?

01:22:11.567 --> 01:22:13.033
Oh, I can't believe it.

01:22:13.068 --> 01:22:15.035
After all I did for that guy.

01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:18.023
So, you don't know anything
about this investigation?

01:22:18.106 --> 01:22:20.541
No! Well, a sort of acquaintance of mine

01:22:20.576 --> 01:22:23.078
Who now works in Morgenthau's
office approached me,

01:22:23.579 --> 01:22:25.581
But I didn't tell him anything.

01:22:25.616 --> 01:22:27.350
You didn't tell me about that.

01:22:27.385 --> 01:22:29.084
I didn't think it was important.

01:22:29.119 --> 01:22:30.353
It only just happened.

01:22:30.388 --> 01:22:31.587
When? Tonight. Just now.

01:22:33.088 --> 01:22:35.090
Why did you use the past perfect then?

01:22:35.125 --> 01:22:37.860
I used the past perfect?

01:22:37.895 --> 01:22:40.596
Yeah. "I was approached..."

01:22:41.597 --> 01:22:44.099

Don't talk to me.

01:23:03.619 --> 01:23:05.120
Bernie knows about the investigation.

01:23:05.155 --> 01:23:06.587
I haven't told you anything.

01:23:06.622 --> 01:23:08.373
There was some leak
at the precinct level.

01:23:08.408 --> 01:23:10.125
Bernie had an informant,
but it's been fixed.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.627
It's not a problem any longer.

01:23:11.662 --> 01:23:12.593
It's a problem.

I've never said anything to you.

01:23:14.129 --> 01:23:15.631
You have to make that clear to everyone.

01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:16.632
That doesn't matter.

01:23:16.667 --> 01:23:17.633

And it might not look so good.

01:23:23.472 --> 01:23:25.140
Cut out the drugs, des.

01:23:25.175 --> 01:23:26.141
What?

01:23:26.558 --> 01:23:29.144

01:23:40.155 --> 01:23:41.156
Well...

01:23:42.157 --> 01:23:43.909
who's accusing me of this?

01:23:43.944 --> 01:23:45.626
This is you, isn't it, josh?

01:23:45.661 --> 01:23:48.864
That's a conflict. We
both like the same girl.

01:23:50.666 --> 01:23:52.668
So, you really want
to go to a beef house?

01:23:52.703 --> 01:23:53.686
A beetha.

01:23:53.721 --> 01:23:54.696
A beefha.

01:23:54.731 --> 01:23:55.671
A beefha.

01:23:55.837 --> 01:23:58.173
They go topless at a beefha.

01:23:58.674 --> 01:24:00.676
I hear san Sebastian's pretty good.

01:24:01.176 --> 01:24:02.177
Oh, look, there's blood.

01:24:02.678 --> 01:24:03.628
Ciao.

01:24:06.682 --> 01:24:08.684
Ciao. Good night.

01:24:09.685 --> 01:24:10.686
Look out.

01:24:10.852 --> 01:24:12.187
Oh, god!

01:24:17.609 --> 01:24:20.112
Oh, my god!

01:24:24.199 --> 01:24:25.867
I didn't know anything about it.

01:24:26.201 --> 01:24:27.152
The agency just funneled

01:24:27.703 --> 01:24:29.204
Clients they wanted to get
into the club through me.

01:24:29.704 --> 01:24:31.205
Usually, before I got into the car,

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.672
I hadn't even met them.

01:24:32.707 --> 01:24:35.209
I just assumed they were
clients from out of town.

01:24:35.244 --> 01:24:36.711
That the I.R.S. Was our largest client

01:24:36.746 --> 01:24:38.162
Didn't occur to me then.

01:24:38.245 --> 01:24:42.216
I swear I didn't know
anything about it, des,

01:24:42.333 --> 01:24:43.217
At first.

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.184
You scumbag.

01:24:45.219 --> 01:24:47.671
Josh promised me you'd be protected.

01:24:47.755 --> 01:24:50.189
Oh, great. What's a little shocking

01:24:50.224 --> 01:24:52.727
Is that they'd do something
so obvious and clumsy

01:24:53.177 --> 01:24:54.193
And move so fast,

01:24:54.228 --> 01:24:56.230
No matter how richly I
may feel you deserved it.

01:24:56.731 --> 01:24:57.732
These were just some creeps

01:24:58.232 --> 01:24:59.734
Mad van'd turned them away before.

01:25:00.234 --> 01:25:02.702
Van's operating under
tremendous pressure.

01:25:02.737 --> 01:25:04.739
I'm starting to feel a lot
of sympathy for the guy.

01:25:04.774 --> 01:25:06.741
Oh, great. That's priceless.

01:25:06.857 --> 01:25:09.243
You and van, oh, I love that.

01:25:09.278 --> 01:25:11.245
Oh!

01:25:11.495 --> 01:25:13.247
Want a snort?

01:25:13.497 --> 01:25:14.714
Guess not.

01:25:14.749 --> 01:25:17.001
I have a very bad feeling
about the club, des.

01:25:17.036 --> 01:25:19.253
It's like a meteorite is
headed straight for it.

01:25:19.288 --> 01:25:20.720
It's gonna destroy everything.

01:25:20.755 --> 01:25:22.757
The greatest club the
worid has ever seen

01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:24.759
Is going to be smashed to smithereens.

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:27.762
Yeah, well, I don't think
it'll be a meteorite.

01:25:29.263 --> 01:25:30.765
Bye.

01:25:33.267 --> 01:25:36.270
Alice and I are having
breakfast together.

01:25:36.305 --> 01:25:39.273
It's a date. You can't come.

01:25:39.308 --> 01:25:40.775
Sorry.

01:25:41.776 --> 01:25:43.778
Try to get some sleep.

01:25:43.861 --> 01:25:46.280
That's what guys do
who want to date you?

01:25:46.614 --> 01:25:47.782
They say they have a book idea?

01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:49.283
Maybe.

01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:51.285
Did he say what the book was?

01:25:51.485 --> 01:25:53.252
He said he had some crazy ideas

01:25:53.287 --> 01:25:54.789
For a book on the
criminal justice system.

01:25:54.824 --> 01:25:56.255
Of course. That makes sense.

01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:58.793
Crazy ideas are the kind
that josh would have.

01:25:58.828 --> 01:26:00.760
Be careful of that guy.

01:26:00.795 --> 01:26:02.797
I was there when he flipped out.

01:26:02.832 --> 01:26:04.298
Really scary.

01:26:04.381 --> 01:26:06.300
He got up on a table at a
cafeteria off Harvard square

01:26:06.335 --> 01:26:09.303
And started weirdly singing this hymn.

01:26:09.637 --> 01:26:12.723
Apparently, religious
mania is highly typical

01:26:12.758 --> 01:26:15.785
Of manic depression
entering its manic phase.

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.813
Josh is not just your
garden-Variety loon.

01:26:18.848 --> 01:26:20.314
He is a serious nutcase.

01:26:20.764 --> 01:26:22.817
What gets me is that
this serious nutcase

01:26:22.852 --> 01:26:24.819
Now presumes to judge others.

01:26:27.988 --> 01:26:29.824
You really think the
neurological effects of coffee

01:26:29.859 --> 01:26:31.593
Is similar to that of cocaine?

01:26:31.628 --> 01:26:33.327
That's what I read somewhere.

01:26:42.837 --> 01:26:44.839
In addition to amazing stories,

01:26:44.874 --> 01:26:45.805
There are a lot

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.341
Of entertaining prosecutors' anecdotes.

01:26:47.376 --> 01:26:48.860
And then there's the whole culture

01:26:48.895 --> 01:26:50.344
Of the downtown legal district.

01:26:50.461 --> 01:26:51.811
It could be good.

01:26:51.846 --> 01:26:55.850
Like everything, it all
depends on execution.

01:26:56.050 --> 01:26:57.316
This is sort of related.

01:26:57.351 --> 01:26:58.853
It's an article I wrote for Harper's

01:26:58.888 --> 01:27:00.855
During law school.

01:27:04.859 --> 01:27:06.861
Did you really just want to have lunch

01:27:06.896 --> 01:27:08.863
To discuss a book proposal?

01:27:08.898 --> 01:27:10.865
Um... no.

01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:15.135
How serious are you and des?

01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:17.621
Is it absolutely, completely,

01:27:17.656 --> 01:27:19.338
Irrevocably serious?

01:27:19.373 --> 01:27:20.875
Did he tell you the story about

01:27:21.375 --> 01:27:22.877
How he was traumatized
by a Radcliffe girl

01:27:22.912 --> 01:27:24.343
Taking off her shirt,

01:27:24.378 --> 01:27:26.380
Suddenly revealing her largish breasts,

01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:28.382
Which he never thought about before?

01:27:28.883 --> 01:27:30.850
He tells that story all the time

01:27:30.885 --> 01:27:32.386
To get sympathy and to justify himself,

01:27:32.887 --> 01:27:33.888
As if he were the victim

01:27:34.388 --> 01:27:35.389
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity.

01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:36.891
That wasn't true?

01:27:37.057 --> 01:27:38.858
No, it was true. He was the victim

01:27:38.893 --> 01:27:40.394
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity,

01:27:40.429 --> 01:27:41.861
But so was everyone else.

01:27:41.896 --> 01:27:44.398
Not everyone then went on a rampage

01:27:44.433 --> 01:27:45.399
Exploiting the opposite sex.

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.402
He thinks his problem is just
that he falls in love a lot.

01:27:48.736 --> 01:27:51.438
Well, a lot of people
fall in love a lot.

01:27:53.574 --> 01:27:56.410
I'm really surprised
you'd be taken in by him.

01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:00.915
You should notice I didn't
answer your original question.

01:28:01.248 --> 01:28:02.381
My original question,

01:28:02.416 --> 01:28:06.370
Whether you were
absolutely committed to des,

01:28:06.453 --> 01:28:08.188
You didn't answer?

01:28:08.223 --> 01:28:09.924
What does "loon" mean?

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.426
Des calls me that.

01:28:13.928 --> 01:28:15.429
I sort of like it.

01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:17.932
It's, uh, short for "lunatic"

01:28:18.382 --> 01:28:21.435
And also the lake bird
with the eerie call.

01:28:24.939 --> 01:28:26.941
It's the other terms
des uses for me...

01:28:26.976 --> 01:28:28.943
"Nutcase,"
"freakazoid," etcetera...

01:28:28.978 --> 01:28:30.945
I kind of mind.

01:28:33.948 --> 01:28:35.414
A lot of people like to say

01:28:35.449 --> 01:28:37.451
They won't take "no" for an answer.

01:28:37.486 --> 01:28:38.953
I just wanted you to know

01:28:38.988 --> 01:28:40.419
I'm not one of them.

01:28:40.454 --> 01:28:42.956
I can be easily discouraged.

01:28:42.991 --> 01:28:45.459
I will take "no" for an answer.

01:28:45.494 --> 01:28:47.228
Ok.

01:28:47.263 --> 01:28:48.928
No.

01:28:48.963 --> 01:28:50.464
You don't mean that.

01:28:50.499 --> 01:28:51.966
No.

01:29:05.729 --> 01:29:07.606
I'm sorry.
She's not in right now.

01:29:07.641 --> 01:29:09.483
Ok. I'll have her call
you back. Thank you.

01:29:09.518 --> 01:29:10.484
Alice, sorry.

01:29:10.519 --> 01:29:11.450
What?

01:29:11.485 --> 01:29:13.487
You better see bob.

01:29:15.489 --> 01:29:17.491
Bob wants to see you right away.

01:29:17.526 --> 01:29:18.958
It's something bad?

01:29:18.993 --> 01:29:20.995
The author of your
Tibet book doesn't exist.

01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.996
He's a fraud.

01:29:22.413 --> 01:29:23.697
Carol thinks it could be worse

01:29:23.998 --> 01:29:26.500
Than the Clifford Irving case.

01:29:27.001 --> 01:29:29.478
Carol thinks it's as bad
as the Clifford Irving case.

01:29:29.513 --> 01:29:31.955
Turns out the author isn't
the Dalai lama's brother,

01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:34.525
But a Los Ángeles writer
named John Disimio.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.036
It's a shame. This
is a really good book.

01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:39.513
Dan thinks it's one of the best things

01:29:39.548 --> 01:29:41.015
Ever written on Tibetan Buddhism.

01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:41.981
What a mess.

01:29:42.016 --> 01:29:44.768
I'm sorry I haven't been more of a help.

01:29:44.803 --> 01:29:47.521
I've been a little preoccupied myself.

01:29:47.556 --> 01:29:49.023
I'm late for my period.

01:29:49.523 --> 01:29:50.024
How late?

01:29:50.524 --> 01:29:51.025
A day.

01:29:51.525 --> 01:29:53.027
A day late, and you're worried?

01:29:53.062 --> 01:29:54.493
I'm sure I'm pregnant.

01:29:54.528 --> 01:29:56.030
But isn't that what you wanted?

01:29:56.065 --> 01:29:57.496
What do you mean?

01:29:57.531 --> 01:29:58.998
Well, I thought you said

01:29:59.033 --> 01:30:01.035
You wanted to have
Jimmy Steinway's babies.

01:30:01.535 --> 01:30:03.037
Yeah, but not this way.

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:07.791
I'm not an addict.

01:30:07.826 --> 01:30:09.008
I'm a habitual user.

01:30:09.043 --> 01:30:10.544
I'm sick of you and that nut case

01:30:10.579 --> 01:30:12.046
Going around judging everybody.

01:30:12.546 --> 01:30:13.512
"Oh, he's an addict."

01:30:13.547 --> 01:30:14.513
"Oh, he's basically honorable

01:30:14.548 --> 01:30:16.050
Except for his treatment of women."

01:30:16.085 --> 01:30:17.551
I am not a womanizer.

01:30:18.052 --> 01:30:20.019
In fact, I hate womanizers.

01:30:20.054 --> 01:30:22.556
In any case, Alice
completely changed all that.

01:30:28.062 --> 01:30:29.563
Isn't that a little morbid?

01:30:29.598 --> 01:30:30.564
Morbid?

01:30:31.065 --> 01:30:33.067
Why take on all that baggage?

01:30:33.102 --> 01:30:35.034
Isn't he a bit of a sicko?

01:30:35.069 --> 01:30:37.071
From the start, you know he's defective.

01:30:37.571 --> 01:30:39.073
Usually you don't find that out

01:30:39.573 --> 01:30:40.489
Until much later.

01:30:40.524 --> 01:30:42.576
And what if you have kids?

01:30:42.611 --> 01:30:44.345
It can be hereditary.

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.045
One thing about Jimmy:

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:48.547
I know he'll make a good father.

01:30:48.582 --> 01:30:50.584
There's always some
problem, some baggage.

01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:53.087
Oh, my god, you're serious.

01:30:53.122 --> 01:30:56.039
Well, not necessarily.

01:30:58.092 --> 01:31:00.059
Coming.

01:31:00.094 --> 01:31:02.096
Tonight I'm gonna tell Jimmy.

01:31:02.131 --> 01:31:03.597
Wish me luck.

01:31:05.599 --> 01:31:08.101
You know, I think my father could have

01:31:08.136 --> 01:31:10.569
Been an undiagnosed manic-Depressive.

01:31:10.604 --> 01:31:13.607
Hi. Uh, do you know josh
is downstairs waiting?

01:31:13.642 --> 01:31:15.109
Yeah. Thanks.

01:31:15.144 --> 01:31:16.075
Bye.

01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:18.577
Bye. Bye.

01:31:18.612 --> 01:31:19.578
Alice is so great.

01:31:19.613 --> 01:31:22.116
I've gotta be a better friend to her.

01:31:22.616 --> 01:31:23.617
Yeah.

01:31:29.123 --> 01:31:30.589
Before leaving the D.A.'S office,

01:31:30.624 --> 01:31:33.627
I'd like at least once the chance to use

01:31:33.662 --> 01:31:35.897
The expression, "book this clown!"

01:31:35.932 --> 01:31:38.132
Heh. I thought only police said that.

01:31:38.167 --> 01:31:39.901
No, I think an a.D.A. Could,

01:31:39.936 --> 01:31:41.786
In certain circumstances,

01:31:41.821 --> 01:31:43.637
Perhaps not very typical.

01:31:43.672 --> 01:31:44.971
Are you aware

01:31:45.006 --> 01:31:46.973
All your clothes are slightly big?

01:31:47.008 --> 01:31:49.510
I'm still waiting for my growing spurt.

01:31:49.545 --> 01:31:52.013
Both my father and
brother are over 6'3".

01:31:52.048 --> 01:31:54.515
You can still grow in your twenties.

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:55.982
There are cases on record.

01:31:56.017 --> 01:31:58.519
Tall people tend to
have great personalities,

01:31:58.554 --> 01:32:00.021
This kind, compassionate comprehension

01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:02.023
Of the rest of the worid.

01:32:02.523 --> 01:32:05.026
My father and brother are both that way.

01:32:07.028 --> 01:32:08.494
What's wrong?

01:32:08.529 --> 01:32:09.530
Just remembering something.

01:32:09.565 --> 01:32:11.532
What?

01:32:12.033 --> 01:32:13.034
It's kind of maudlin.

01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:14.000
It was here

01:32:14.035 --> 01:32:16.037
My depression first descended.

01:32:16.072 --> 01:32:17.538
Oh.

01:32:18.039 --> 01:32:19.540
"To the valiant seamen

01:32:19.575 --> 01:32:21.007
"Who perished in the Maine

01:32:21.042 --> 01:32:23.544
By fate unwarned, in death unafraid."

01:32:23.579 --> 01:32:25.814
Isn't this the strangest,

01:32:25.849 --> 01:32:28.283
Most forlorn monument?

01:32:28.318 --> 01:32:30.718
Yeah, it's very sad.

01:32:32.553 --> 01:32:34.555
What happened with your depression?

01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:35.521
Nothing at first.

01:32:35.556 --> 01:32:38.059
I just went back to
Cambridge very depressed.

01:32:38.559 --> 01:32:41.027
Then there was the incident
at the hayes-Bickford,

01:32:41.062 --> 01:32:44.065
After which I was taken to
mass. Mental for observation.

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:47.068
While there, I cut my hand
trying to open a stuck window,

01:32:47.568 --> 01:32:49.070
And they put me on a suicide watch,

01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:52.072
Though I don't think I
was ever really suicidal,

01:32:52.107 --> 01:32:54.575
At least no more than a
lot of people that age.

01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:56.577
But you're ok now?

01:32:56.612 --> 01:32:57.578
Uh...

01:32:58.079 --> 01:32:59.045
yeah.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:02.583
Actually, a lot of people
spend considerable sums of money

01:33:02.618 --> 01:33:05.086
To get the high I get
absolutely naturally.

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:06.052
Now, with lithium,

01:33:06.087 --> 01:33:08.589
Which is, in fact, a
naturally occurring salt,

01:33:09.090 --> 01:33:11.592
I can stay on a perfectly even keel,

01:33:11.627 --> 01:33:13.094
Perhaps too even.

01:33:14.595 --> 01:33:17.098
Did they prescribe lithium right away?

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:18.599
Lithium wasn't so standard then.

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:22.103
There was a lot of muddling
through various therapies.

01:33:22.138 --> 01:33:24.372
Because my right hand was bandaged,

01:33:24.407 --> 01:33:26.607
I used my left to write friends cards,

01:33:27.108 --> 01:33:28.074
Which was a mistake.

01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:30.611
My handwriting looked weird
and really scared people.

01:33:31.112 --> 01:33:33.579
I... I don't think
I was ever that...

01:33:33.614 --> 01:33:36.117
that badly off, but
others might disagree.

01:33:38.119 --> 01:33:39.585
Do you know the words

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:42.588
To the hymn dear lord
and father of mankind?

01:33:42.623 --> 01:33:46.627
While I was in the hospital,
it became a sort of mantra.

01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:48.129

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:49.630

What's wrong?

You think I'm a wacko?

01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:32.172
What's wrong?

01:34:32.207 --> 01:34:33.639
Uh, I don't know.

01:34:33.674 --> 01:34:34.675
Charlotte's in terrible pain.

01:34:35.176 --> 01:34:36.642
It's her back.

01:34:36.677 --> 01:34:37.678
No, nothing happened.

01:34:37.978 --> 01:34:40.681
We were just talking.

01:34:40.716 --> 01:34:41.647
About what?

01:34:41.682 --> 01:34:43.684
Charlotte said she
had something important

01:34:43.719 --> 01:34:45.651
She wanted to talk to me about,

01:34:45.686 --> 01:34:48.154
But before we got to
that, her period started.

01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:50.691
Afterwards, I mentioned
that it might be a good time

01:34:50.726 --> 01:34:51.657
To start thinking about

01:34:51.692 --> 01:34:53.694
Whether we were really
right for one another

01:34:53.729 --> 01:34:55.196
Or we should start thinking about,

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:57.198
You know, breaking up.

01:35:07.041 --> 01:35:09.710
Josh hasn't called since that night.

01:35:09.745 --> 01:35:11.212
Of course he hasn't.

01:35:11.345 --> 01:35:13.214
What do you mean?

01:35:13.464 --> 01:35:15.299
Oh, come on. You told me.

01:35:15.334 --> 01:35:17.277
He sang a hymn or something.

01:35:17.312 --> 01:35:19.185
You were totally weirded out.

01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.222
I can't believe how intolerant you are.

01:35:21.722 --> 01:35:23.974
Some of those old hymns are beautiful.

01:35:24.009 --> 01:35:26.192
I've sung them on the street myself.

01:35:26.227 --> 01:35:28.729
I didn't realize it
was so controversial.

01:35:30.231 --> 01:35:34.700

There are a couple of alternatives

01:36:35.262 --> 01:36:36.228
That aren't that that-Bad.

01:36:36.263 --> 01:36:38.265
First, some guy who's
already been around a lot

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.767
And almost certainly has it anyway,

01:36:39.802 --> 01:36:40.768
So it'd be no problem

01:36:41.268 --> 01:36:42.770
And, in fact, would give
you something in common.

01:36:42.853 --> 01:36:43.771
The other would be some guy

01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:45.272
So idealistic and in love with you

01:36:45.689 --> 01:36:47.274
That he'd want to commit himself to you

01:36:47.775 --> 01:36:49.777
Prior to that step
because his dream would be

01:36:50.277 --> 01:36:52.279
To be with you forever,
always, exclusively anyway.

01:36:52.314 --> 01:36:54.898
I think skip's a bit that way.

01:37:17.421 --> 01:37:18.270
What?

01:37:18.305 --> 01:37:20.307
I need to see des. It's urgent.

01:37:20.724 --> 01:37:21.774
He's busy.

01:37:21.809 --> 01:37:23.811
He'll wanna know this.

01:37:25.813 --> 01:37:27.314
Des!

01:37:27.514 --> 01:37:28.816
Des!

01:37:29.099 --> 01:37:29.817
Des, open up!

01:37:30.317 --> 01:37:32.319
I didn't let him in, des.

01:37:32.653 --> 01:37:34.321
He got by me.

01:37:34.488 --> 01:37:36.824
Jesus Christ. Are
you out of you mind?

01:37:36.907 --> 01:37:40.327
It's about to start.
Get rid of all your "gifts"

01:37:40.362 --> 01:37:42.329
And anything else you might have.

01:37:44.331 --> 01:37:45.297
Oh.

01:37:45.332 --> 01:37:47.835
Step aside. Coming through.

01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:48.836
Names.

01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:55.342
Take this guy at the door.

01:37:56.844 --> 01:37:58.345
We're on the list.

01:38:03.684 --> 01:38:05.352
Jesus Christ, you're not
gonna use that against me

01:38:05.853 --> 01:38:06.819
With Alice, are you?

01:38:06.854 --> 01:38:08.856
Francesca was just feeling
terribly needy tonight.

01:38:09.273 --> 01:38:11.567
It has nothing to do with
how I feel about Alice.

01:38:11.602 --> 01:38:13.861
You're not gonna take
unfair advantage of that.

01:38:14.361 --> 01:38:14.862
Ok.

01:38:15.312 --> 01:38:16.864
All right, let's go!

01:38:19.366 --> 01:38:20.484
I'm a cop.

01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:24.872
This way, gentlemen.

01:38:24.907 --> 01:38:26.839
All right, let's go!

01:38:26.874 --> 01:38:28.375
Downstairs first. Harry, jack.

01:38:41.922 --> 01:38:44.424
We're gonna
come in here. This way.

01:38:49.930 --> 01:38:51.396
You can't touch those.

01:38:51.431 --> 01:38:52.933
Those are my personal papers.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.435
Yeah. Well, they're
part of the premises now,

01:38:55.936 --> 01:38:58.271
And as such, the warrant applies. Sam.

01:39:05.946 --> 01:39:07.080
Book this clown.

01:39:17.924 --> 01:39:18.425
Hi.

01:39:18.925 --> 01:39:19.426
Hi.

01:39:19.926 --> 01:39:22.429
What are you doing here in the dark?

01:39:22.464 --> 01:39:23.847
I was just resting.

01:39:26.433 --> 01:39:28.435
Have you seen josh at all?

01:39:28.601 --> 01:39:30.387
Yeah.

01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:31.454
Is he ok?

01:39:31.489 --> 01:39:32.439
Sure.

01:39:32.522 --> 01:39:33.940
Why wouldn't he be ok?

01:39:34.357 --> 01:39:34.941
I don't know.

01:39:35.442 --> 01:39:36.443
He hasn't called in a while.

01:39:36.776 --> 01:39:38.410
Josh is a bit thin-Skinned.

01:39:38.445 --> 01:39:41.948
He's the kind of guy
who will take no for an answer.

01:39:41.983 --> 01:39:42.914
Sag harbor.

01:39:42.949 --> 01:39:47.037
Did you know I was sort of
infatuated with you then?

01:39:48.455 --> 01:39:50.123
I assumed you preferred Tom.

01:39:52.158 --> 01:39:54.461
Also, you seemed a little...

01:39:54.961 --> 01:39:55.462
irritating.

01:39:55.879 --> 01:39:57.964
How was I irritating?

01:39:58.081 --> 01:39:58.965
Well...

01:39:59.466 --> 01:40:00.932
you weren't.

01:40:00.967 --> 01:40:02.434
There's no chance of you

01:40:02.469 --> 01:40:05.221
Getting infatuated
with me again, is there?

01:40:08.475 --> 01:40:10.343
Just had to confirm that.

01:40:21.988 --> 01:40:24.491
Let me keep your passport for you.

01:40:24.526 --> 01:40:25.457
No.

01:40:25.492 --> 01:40:26.493
Come on, help me out.

01:40:26.993 --> 01:40:27.959
Should people just be allowed

01:40:27.994 --> 01:40:29.996
To steal from each
other and the government,

01:40:30.031 --> 01:40:31.515
And out of selfishness or indifference

01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:32.999
Or a kind of fashionable cynicism,

01:40:33.034 --> 01:40:34.466
The rest of us do nothing?

01:40:34.501 --> 01:40:36.002
I thought better of you than that.

01:40:36.503 --> 01:40:36.968
You did?

01:40:37.003 --> 01:40:39.005
Well, wrong again.

01:40:39.506 --> 01:40:41.508
Listen, you've got all their
books and all their documents.

01:40:42.008 --> 01:40:44.010
Why do you need me who
knew practically nothing?

01:40:44.511 --> 01:40:47.013
This is the only body I've got.

01:40:47.514 --> 01:40:48.765
Good-Bye, josh.

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.016
Kennedy airport.

01:40:54.521 --> 01:40:56.488
Are you a bit of a cad,

01:40:56.523 --> 01:40:58.858
Leaving town with your
girlfriend in the hospital?

01:40:58.893 --> 01:41:00.727
It might look that way.

01:41:01.027 --> 01:41:01.693
But it isn't?

01:41:01.728 --> 01:41:03.029
I've been through this before.

01:41:03.064 --> 01:41:03.995
After graduation,

01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:05.532
Laurie and I were gonna break up,

01:41:05.567 --> 01:41:06.533
But the same day,

01:41:07.033 --> 01:41:08.534
She came down with terrible back spasms.

01:41:08.569 --> 01:41:10.053
I hung around the hospital all summer,

01:41:10.088 --> 01:41:11.538
And I almost bankrupted her parents.

01:41:12.038 --> 01:41:14.005
And as soon as I left
town, she recovered.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.543
By going away and putting
an ocean between us...

01:41:17.043 --> 01:41:18.510
I.E., making a
definitive break...

01:41:18.545 --> 01:41:20.547
Charlotte's likely to
recover much faster.

01:41:20.630 --> 01:41:23.550
What makes you think
putting an ocean between you

01:41:23.585 --> 01:41:26.553
Necessarily means a definitive break?

01:41:27.053 --> 01:41:28.555
That's a depressing thought.

01:41:30.056 --> 01:41:33.059
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf in Spain.

01:41:33.094 --> 01:41:36.062
I'm gonna turn over several new leaves.

01:41:44.571 --> 01:41:45.572
You know that Shakespearean admonition,

01:41:45.607 --> 01:41:47.591
"To thine own self be true"?

01:41:47.626 --> 01:41:49.541
It's premised on the idea

01:41:49.576 --> 01:41:52.078
That "thine own self"
is something pretty good,

01:41:52.113 --> 01:41:54.045
Being true to which is commendable,

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.584
But what if "thine own
self" is not so good?

01:41:57.619 --> 01:41:59.551
What if it's pretty bad?

01:41:59.586 --> 01:42:01.588
Wouldn't it be better in that case

01:42:02.088 --> 01:42:04.591
Not to be true to thine own self?

01:42:04.626 --> 01:42:06.057
See? That's my situation.

01:42:06.092 --> 01:42:08.059
The one I like is, "et tu, brute."

01:42:08.094 --> 01:42:10.346
There are different ways of being loyal.

01:42:10.381 --> 01:42:12.599
Some may seem on the surface disloyal,

01:42:13.099 --> 01:42:13.600
But they're not.

01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:15.101
There's a higher loyalty.

01:42:15.136 --> 01:42:16.603
The way I see it,

01:42:17.103 --> 01:42:19.439
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar.

01:42:20.607 --> 01:42:22.574
By stabbing him in the back,

01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:25.111
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar?

01:42:29.616 --> 01:42:32.619
You know, I probably should
have stayed and testified.

01:42:32.654 --> 01:42:33.585
Josh is right.

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:36.623
Bernie is a bad guy,
probably worse than they know.

01:42:36.658 --> 01:42:38.590
That's what van thinks.
Van's cooperating.

01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:42.128
Staying and cooperating would
have been the right thing to do,

01:42:42.163 --> 01:42:44.648
But instead I'm running like a rat

01:42:44.683 --> 01:42:47.133
Because to thine own self be true.

01:42:52.138 --> 01:42:54.641
They say I can probably
go home tomorrow.

01:42:54.676 --> 01:42:55.642
Great.

01:42:57.644 --> 01:43:00.146
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

01:43:00.181 --> 01:43:02.148
Do you think Jimmy's
going away could have

01:43:02.649 --> 01:43:04.651
Had anything to do with him, you know...

01:43:04.686 --> 01:43:05.617
having some sort

01:43:05.652 --> 01:43:08.154
Of bizarre, pathetic crush on you?

01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:09.621
I don't know.

01:43:09.656 --> 01:43:12.158
Well, did he ever say anything?

01:43:15.161 --> 01:43:16.137
Yes.

01:43:16.172 --> 01:43:17.113
What?

01:43:17.197 --> 01:43:18.164
Well,
he...

01:43:18.665 --> 01:43:19.631
"Why don't you love me

01:43:19.666 --> 01:43:21.668
Instead of jerks like des and josh?"

01:43:21.703 --> 01:43:23.670
That kind of thing?

01:43:25.171 --> 01:43:27.173
I knew it.

01:43:27.257 --> 01:43:28.139
You bitch!

01:43:28.174 --> 01:43:30.376
I knew it was something like that.

01:43:32.178 --> 01:43:35.647
I don't think I want to
room with you anymore.

01:43:35.682 --> 01:43:39.686
Being around you hasn't
been good for me or my back.

01:43:39.721 --> 01:43:41.653
I'd like you to move out.

01:43:41.688 --> 01:43:43.940
I don't know how I'll afford it,

01:43:43.975 --> 01:43:46.157
But my sanity and my integrity

01:43:46.192 --> 01:43:48.159
Are more important to me than money.

01:43:48.194 --> 01:43:51.364
I have to start looking
out for myself now.

01:43:52.198 --> 01:43:53.700
Have you heard the news?

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.167
No, what?

01:43:56.202 --> 01:43:57.203
They're selling the company.

01:43:57.570 --> 01:43:58.705
What?

01:43:58.988 --> 01:44:00.598
We're merging with Simon & Schuster.

01:44:00.633 --> 01:44:02.208
There'll be the usual consolidation

01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:03.675
And economies of scale.

01:44:03.710 --> 01:44:06.713
A lot of us are gonna lose our jobs.

01:44:06.748 --> 01:44:07.714
God, that's sad.

01:44:08.164 --> 01:44:09.180
I love the company.

01:44:09.215 --> 01:44:10.717
They've been so great to us there.

01:44:11.217 --> 01:44:12.468
Well, I don't know.

01:44:12.503 --> 01:44:13.720
We were exploited,

01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:15.722
But they were nice about it.

01:44:16.172 --> 01:44:17.724
Maybe it'd be good if they got rid

01:44:18.224 --> 01:44:20.191
Of some of the deadwood in that company,

01:44:20.226 --> 01:44:22.729
Particularly if it meant
paying the rest of us

01:44:22.764 --> 01:44:24.230
Decently enough to live in this city

01:44:24.731 --> 01:44:26.733
With at least a modicum of privacy.

01:44:33.238 --> 01:44:34.740
Why don't we do something?

01:44:34.775 --> 01:44:35.706
Like what?

01:44:35.741 --> 01:44:37.708
Well, at this time of day,

01:44:37.743 --> 01:44:39.494
Employed people often have lunch.

01:44:39.529 --> 01:44:41.246
I can't. I've gotta go uptown.

01:44:41.281 --> 01:44:42.212
Why?

01:44:42.247 --> 01:44:43.999
Alice and I are having lunch.

01:44:44.034 --> 01:44:45.751
You're having lunch with Alice?

01:44:45.786 --> 01:44:47.019
Great. Let's all go.

01:44:47.054 --> 01:44:48.253
It's, uh, at Lutece.

01:44:48.754 --> 01:44:49.720
You're on unemployment

01:44:49.755 --> 01:44:51.256
And taking Alice to Lutece?

01:44:51.757 --> 01:44:53.759
Um, doesn't irrational expenditures

01:44:53.794 --> 01:44:55.761
Signal the start of a manic phase?

01:44:56.261 --> 01:44:58.764
If it were my invitation,
you'd be right,

01:44:58.799 --> 01:44:59.730
But it's not.

01:44:59.765 --> 01:45:02.267
Alice is taking you to Lutece?

01:45:02.768 --> 01:45:04.234
Why'd she take you?

01:45:04.269 --> 01:45:06.737
Celebrating her promotion.

01:45:06.772 --> 01:45:08.774
When Alice wants to celebrate something,

01:45:08.809 --> 01:45:09.792
She calls you?

01:45:09.827 --> 01:45:10.802
Alice made editor?

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:11.742
Associate editor.

01:45:11.777 --> 01:45:13.528
Well, what happened with her book?

01:45:13.563 --> 01:45:15.280
I thought it was some kind of fiasco.

01:45:15.315 --> 01:45:16.782
What Alice did, rather cleverly,

01:45:16.817 --> 01:45:17.748
Was shift the category

01:45:17.783 --> 01:45:19.785
From nonfiction to self-Actualization.

01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.787
The book jackets
hadn't been printed yet.

01:45:21.822 --> 01:45:23.288
Reincarnation,
life after death...

01:45:23.323 --> 01:45:24.557
Mumbo jumbo of all kinds

01:45:24.592 --> 01:45:25.756
Has been highly commercial

01:45:25.791 --> 01:45:27.793
Throughout the history
of book publishing.

01:45:27.828 --> 01:45:29.812
The first printed book was the bible.

01:45:29.847 --> 01:45:31.762
Actually, I'm not upset I was laid off.

01:45:31.797 --> 01:45:34.299
This'll motivate me to get
a better job in television,

01:45:34.334 --> 01:45:36.068
Which is where my interests truly lie.

01:45:36.103 --> 01:45:37.803
I've watched television all my life.

01:45:38.303 --> 01:45:38.804
If you're really

01:45:39.304 --> 01:45:39.805
Interested in television,

01:45:40.305 --> 01:45:41.306
You should come over and watch

01:45:41.341 --> 01:45:42.307
Wild kingdom sometime.

01:45:42.342 --> 01:45:43.273
Sure.

01:45:43.308 --> 01:45:44.810
Are you taking the "e" train?

01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:45.811
Yeah.

01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:46.812
$2. Thanks.

01:45:47.312 --> 01:45:47.813
Hey, van!

01:45:48.230 --> 01:45:48.814
What happened?

01:45:49.314 --> 01:45:51.566
Ah, the new owners
couldn't make it work.

01:45:51.601 --> 01:45:53.819
Finally had to hire
people to stand outside,

01:45:53.854 --> 01:45:55.588
Pretend that they couldn't get in.

01:45:55.623 --> 01:45:57.322
Anyway, disco's over. It's dead.

01:45:57.823 --> 01:45:58.824
What do you mean?

01:45:59.274 --> 01:46:01.827
Well, people just aren't
going out like they used to.

01:46:01.862 --> 01:46:02.793
They're tired.

01:46:02.828 --> 01:46:04.579
Some are sick or strung out.

01:46:04.614 --> 01:46:06.331
It's not just the prosecutions

01:46:06.832 --> 01:46:08.834
And all the owners
that Bernie squealed on.

01:46:09.034 --> 01:46:11.336
Could part of it be related
to the herpes epidemic?

01:46:11.371 --> 01:46:12.838
Maybe. I've got a friend

01:46:13.338 --> 01:46:14.339
At Casablanca records and tapes,

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:16.842
And she says that, like, 2 months ago,

01:46:17.342 --> 01:46:20.345
The bottom dropped out
of all disco record sales.

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:21.847
Suddenly, it's...

01:46:21.882 --> 01:46:23.348
dead, over.

01:46:23.548 --> 01:46:25.950
God, that's sad.

01:46:25.985 --> 01:46:28.318
We're getting older.

01:46:28.353 --> 01:46:30.856
We've lived through
a period that's ended.

01:46:31.356 --> 01:46:32.858
It's like dying a little bit.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.362
Disco will never be over.

01:46:37.646 --> 01:46:39.865
It will always live in
our minds and hearts.

01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:41.634
Something like this, that was this big

01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:43.368
And this important and this great,

01:46:43.403 --> 01:46:44.369
Will never die.

01:46:44.619 --> 01:46:46.872
Oh, for a few years, maybe many years,

01:46:47.072 --> 01:46:48.874
It'll be considered
pass? And ridiculous.

01:46:48.957 --> 01:46:49.875
It will be misrepresented

01:46:50.375 --> 01:46:51.626
And caricatured and sneered at,

01:46:51.661 --> 01:46:52.878
Or worse, completely ignored.

01:46:53.378 --> 01:46:54.880
People will laugh about John Travolta,

01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.882
Olivia newton-John,
white polyester suits

01:46:57.382 --> 01:46:58.917
And platform shoes and going like this.

01:46:59.384 --> 01:47:01.887
Though we had nothing
to do with those things

01:47:01.922 --> 01:47:02.888
And still loved disco.

01:47:03.388 --> 01:47:04.890
Those who didn't understand
will never understand.

01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:07.392
Disco was much more and
much better than all that.

01:47:07.893 --> 01:47:08.859
Disco was too great

01:47:08.894 --> 01:47:10.896
And too much fun to be gone forever.

01:47:11.396 --> 01:47:12.898
It's got to come back someday.

01:47:13.398 --> 01:47:16.017
I just hope it will be
in our own lifetimes.

01:47:16.902 --> 01:47:19.404
Sorry. I've got a job
interview this afternoon,

01:47:19.439 --> 01:47:21.371
And I was trying to get revved up,

01:47:21.406 --> 01:47:23.909
But most of what I said, I, uh, believe.

01:47:24.025 --> 01:47:26.361
I was pretty furious when you had

01:47:26.444 --> 01:47:27.679
My passport lifted, confiscated,

01:47:27.714 --> 01:47:28.914
At the airport, but you were right.

01:47:28.949 --> 01:47:29.915
I'm glad I stayed.

01:47:30.365 --> 01:47:30.916
At least you saved me

01:47:31.416 --> 01:47:32.417
From being stuck in some foreign city

01:47:32.701 --> 01:47:34.060
With the likes of Jimmy Steinway.

01:47:34.095 --> 01:47:35.385
But there's one thing I don't get.

01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.422
You did a good job with the prosecution,

01:47:37.457 --> 01:47:39.424
Getting Bernie to squeal that way.

01:47:39.459 --> 01:47:40.891
Why'd they lay you off?

01:47:40.926 --> 01:47:42.427
There was a conflict involving

01:47:42.928 --> 01:47:44.930
Giving preferential
treatment to a friend

01:47:45.013 --> 01:47:47.432
Which they felt I handled badly.

01:47:47.467 --> 01:47:48.433
Oh.

01:47:50.435 --> 01:47:53.054
Well, congratulate Alice for us.

01:47:54.439 --> 01:47:55.440
Bye.

01:47:55.475 --> 01:47:56.441
Bye.

01:47:56.558 --> 01:47:57.407
Bye.

01:47:57.442 --> 01:48:00.445
I don't envy her, though,
stuck in book publishing.

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.411
Oof. Yeah.

01:48:01.446 --> 01:48:03.949
I've gotta get to
unemployment and sign up.

01:48:04.449 --> 01:48:05.951
I'm going to Florida this afternoon.

01:48:06.451 --> 01:48:06.952
So long.

01:48:07.402 --> 01:48:08.954
Bye. Bye.

01:48:12.457 --> 01:48:14.960
One of the things that
makes me happy in life

01:48:14.995 --> 01:48:16.962
Is knowing that I don't envy anyone.

01:48:16.997 --> 01:48:18.981
I don't want to be anybody else

01:48:19.016 --> 01:48:20.966
Or do anything but what I'm doing,

01:48:21.001 --> 01:48:22.432
Which, right now, is nothing,

01:48:22.467 --> 01:48:24.970
But I have good projects for the future.

01:48:25.005 --> 01:48:26.471
Can I speak honestly?

01:48:26.506 --> 01:48:27.437
Yeah.

01:48:27.472 --> 01:48:28.939
You and I are similar.

01:48:28.974 --> 01:48:30.475
We both got big personalities.

01:48:30.976 --> 01:48:33.478
That's good. The worid, frankly,
needs more big personalities.

01:48:33.979 --> 01:48:36.731
But perhaps ours burn too brightly,

01:48:36.766 --> 01:48:39.126
Are too big for people with normal,

01:48:39.161 --> 01:48:41.451
Healthy-Size personalities like Alice

01:48:41.486 --> 01:48:44.489
Or abnormal, healthy-Sized
personalities like josh

01:48:44.524 --> 01:48:45.956
Or itsy-Bitsy,
teeny-Weeny,

01:48:45.991 --> 01:48:47.993
Polka-Dot-Bikini-Size
personalities

01:48:48.028 --> 01:48:49.011
Like Jimmy Steinway.

01:48:49.046 --> 01:48:49.960
That's why I'm confident

01:48:49.995 --> 01:48:51.997
I'll ultimately be
successful in television.

01:48:52.032 --> 01:48:53.964
Absolutely. See, one of the problems

01:48:53.999 --> 01:48:56.001
Of finding the right
person and settling down

01:48:56.036 --> 01:48:58.003
Is it takes all the fun and interest

01:48:58.503 --> 01:48:59.504
Out of going to nightclubs.

01:49:00.005 --> 01:49:01.506
I mean, if you're already
living with somebody,

01:49:02.007 --> 01:49:02.973
Why bother going out?

01:49:03.008 --> 01:49:04.509
Getting seriously involved with someone

01:49:05.010 --> 01:49:07.012
Really just means
ruining your nightlife.

01:49:07.047 --> 01:49:09.281
What I mean to say is,

01:49:09.316 --> 01:49:11.516
Jimmy, Alice, Josh...

01:49:11.551 --> 01:49:12.482
so what?

01:49:12.517 --> 01:49:13.984
That's what I say.

01:49:14.019 --> 01:49:16.021
I think I agree with you.
