09:07.257 --> 09:08.482
Jackie, who would you pick?

09:08.484 --> 09:09.848
I'd go by myself.

09:09.851 --> 09:12.786
Okay, let's say if you went by yourself,

09:12.788 --> 09:14.154
you would starve to death.

09:14.156 --> 09:15.689
- That's fine.
- Oh.

09:15.691 --> 09:18.125
I'd pick Van because he's rich, and...

09:18.127 --> 09:19.693
people would probably look for him.

09:19.695 --> 09:21.962
Also, I can tell by his brittle nails

09:21.964 --> 09:23.697
that he has an iron deficiency,

09:23.699 --> 09:25.463
so by day ten...

09:25.466 --> 09:27.701
I'd be able to overpower him,

09:27.703 --> 09:29.703
and then I'd eat him.

09:29.705 --> 09:31.972
Piece by piece.

09:31.974 --> 09:35.175
While he was still alive so
that the meat doesn't spoil,

09:35.177 --> 09:37.577
and I could survive long
enough to be rescued.

09:44.586 --> 09:46.153
- Teddy, you're up!
- Well...

09:46.155 --> 09:48.155
Team building is super lame,

09:48.157 --> 09:49.723
but obviously, if I
had to pick somebody,

09:49.725 --> 09:52.726
I would pick my boy,
Ron, because he's my boy.

09:52.728 --> 09:53.827
Awe.

09:53.829 --> 09:55.026
Ron, what about you?

09:55.029 --> 09:57.564
- Oh, I know, I'd pick...
- Go ahead.

09:57.566 --> 09:59.566
- Um...
- Go ahead.

09:59.568 --> 10:01.969
- Jackie.
- Awkward!

10:03.372 --> 10:05.372
How are you not picking me?

10:05.374 --> 10:08.976
It's just that Jackie's
smart and practical, and plus,

10:08.978 --> 10:11.745
she's a mom so you know she
keeps snacks in her purse.

10:11.747 --> 10:13.133
Yeah, but we're best friends.

10:13.136 --> 10:14.815
If we were doing practical,
I would've picked Emily.

10:14.817 --> 10:16.250
Aww, Teddy, that...

10:16.252 --> 10:17.484
But I don't want to
spend time with Emily.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.586
I wanna hang out with my bro!

10:19.588 --> 10:21.422
Fine, look, if you must know,

10:21.424 --> 10:23.824
it's just that nothing's
ever good enough for you.

10:23.826 --> 10:25.159
And if you're on a desert island,

10:25.161 --> 10:26.560
you must remain positive.

10:26.563 --> 10:28.762
There's a reason why Tom
Hanks put a smiley face

10:28.764 --> 10:30.864
- on that volleyball.
- Oh, come on,

10:30.866 --> 10:33.500
at best, that volleyball
looked nonplussed.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.552
He was bewildered.

10:34.555 --> 10:36.337
Well, I wouldn't bring Teddy because

10:36.339 --> 10:38.405
he's too frail to catch or be food.

10:38.407 --> 10:40.407
Well, I would never bring you, Wendy.

10:40.409 --> 10:43.210
And by the way, I have been
blasting my quads lately,

10:43.212 --> 10:44.745
and they are a healthy
dose of lean protein.

10:44.747 --> 10:46.013
- Jackie, feel my thigh.
- No.

10:46.015 --> 10:47.475
- Feel the thigh!
- No!

10:47.478 --> 10:49.550
I told you, I don't want
to eat any of you idiots.

10:49.552 --> 10:50.998
I just want to die alone.

10:51.001 --> 10:53.854
Well, luckily for you, that
is definitely going to hap...

10:53.856 --> 10:55.889
Don't finish that sentence
if you want to live.

10:55.891 --> 10:57.017
Okay, guys,

10:57.020 --> 10:59.092
I think we're missing
the point of the game.

10:59.095 --> 11:00.894
You're supposed to
say something positive.

11:00.896 --> 11:03.530
Well, I'm positive that
Teddy couldn't spear a fish

11:03.532 --> 11:06.100
to save his life.

11:06.102 --> 11:08.302
The hell I can't.

11:08.304 --> 11:11.305
I bet you 50 bucks you
can't throw this tiki torch

11:11.307 --> 11:13.307
hard enough to knock
over that trash can.

11:13.309 --> 11:14.575
Again, not the game.

11:14.577 --> 11:15.876
- You're on.
- Yeah!

11:15.878 --> 11:18.144
Oh, I'm going in on this action.

11:18.147 --> 11:19.947
Oh, God.

11:19.949 --> 11:21.497
All right, give me some
room. Give me some room,

11:21.499 --> 11:23.784
- give me some room.
- All right, all right, all right.

11:23.786 --> 11:25.352
Here we go.

11:27.156 --> 11:29.590
all: Oh!

11:29.592 --> 11:31.158
So, that happened...

11:32.862 --> 11:34.595
<i>Gas breach.</i>

11:34.597 --> 11:36.597
- Oh!
- Follow me!

<i>Gas breach.</i>

11:46.172 --> 11:47.538
<i>Gas breach.</i>

11:51.510 --> 11:53.043
Good thinking, Wendy.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.578
Okay, we should all get the gas masks.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.814
Oh, they're out there.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.616
What? Where?

11:59.618 --> 12:01.519
Why did you bring us in here, then?

12:01.522 --> 12:03.587
Uh, because it has everything we need.

12:03.589 --> 12:06.423
A particle accelerator, a
quantum field synthesizer,

12:06.425 --> 12:09.059
and a bucket where we
can go to the bathroom.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.261
But there's no food or water.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.630
Well, there's that karaoke
machine you love so much.

12:13.632 --> 12:15.265
- Oh, goody!
- Ah, it's broken.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.300
No, it's right...

12:16.302 --> 12:18.469
Oh.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.780
I changed my mind.

12:19.783 --> 12:21.638
I'm picking Teddy for
that desert island thing.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.640
Oh, look at that! Maybe Jackie's my boy.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.676
How dare you! Traitor!

12:25.678 --> 12:28.445
Okay, okay, we are a little stressed.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.114
Now, if we can get the gas masks,

12:30.116 --> 12:32.850
we can get supplies, and
somewhere safe, and...

12:32.852 --> 12:35.452
Who went in the bucket?

12:35.454 --> 12:36.620
You gave me four volcanoes.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.489
I'm only a man.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.690
All right.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.058
It's not a big deal.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.093
One of us will go get the hazmat suit,

12:43.095 --> 12:46.130
grab the gas masks, and come back.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.165
Where are the hazmat suits?

12:48.167 --> 12:49.700
Well, you planned a costume party

12:49.702 --> 12:51.119
the first night of the retreat,

12:51.122 --> 12:54.571
so Dorothy and Randy went as
Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.471
Can we focus?

12:56.496 --> 12:58.496
We just need someone
to hold their breath,

12:58.521 --> 13:00.321
and go out there, and get the masks.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.546
We don't know what that
gas will do to my skin,

13:02.581 --> 13:03.947
or my white linen suit.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.234
Well, I shouldn't go.

13:05.259 --> 13:06.934
I'm a bit of a wildcard.

13:06.959 --> 13:08.955
You can't trust what I'll do out there.

13:08.980 --> 13:09.922
Yeah, and we've already established

13:09.924 --> 13:12.389
that I'm totally useless in
a survival situation, so...

13:12.391 --> 13:13.557
Okay, well, that's fine

13:13.559 --> 13:15.592
because I am perfectly happy

13:15.594 --> 13:17.561
staying here and dying alone.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.163
Check, please.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.567

"So that happened."

18:16.410 --> 18:17.642

18:17.644 --> 18:19.077
<i>Would you like a cherry Danish?</i>

18:19.079 --> 18:20.512
Get him!

18:20.514 --> 18:22.314
<i>- Pull me back in, Teddy!</i>
- Go!

18:22.316 --> 18:23.949
- A little help, a little help...
- You got it, you got it!

18:23.951 --> 18:25.117
- You got this.
- A little help?

18:25.119 --> 18:26.418
I'd help, but...

18:26.420 --> 18:27.753
Pull it!

18:27.755 --> 18:28.976

18:36.864 --> 18:39.331
She was so mean!

18:41.969 --> 18:44.302
Do you think I use my
cuteness as a crutch?

18:44.304 --> 18:45.785
No, Ron.

18:47.774 --> 18:48.956
So now what?

18:48.959 --> 18:52.144
The bathroom bucket's gone,
and Emily's about to die.

18:52.146 --> 18:54.546
We need to fix one of these things.

18:54.548 --> 18:58.784
You know, I'm not usually one
for making speeches, but, uh...

18:58.786 --> 19:01.953
Do you remember what it was
like before Emily came here?

19:01.955 --> 19:03.789
We were all just a bunch of strangers

19:03.791 --> 19:05.957
working in the same office...

19:05.959 --> 19:07.959
but then, a funny thing happened.

19:07.961 --> 19:10.550
A lady named Emily arrived,
and she taught us how to love.

19:10.553 --> 19:11.797
She taught us how to care.

19:11.799 --> 19:14.800
By taking care of all of us.

19:14.802 --> 19:16.901
- Is he doing an accent?
- Yeah.

19:16.904 --> 19:21.039
But she made us a family,
and family means doing...

19:21.041 --> 19:23.946
even if you're doing something
you might not want to do,

19:23.949 --> 19:26.845
but doing it we're gonna do.

19:26.847 --> 19:29.047
And not just for us...

19:29.049 --> 19:31.049
for Emily!

19:31.051 --> 19:33.409
That. Was. Beautiful.

19:36.422 --> 19:39.858
And look at the
instrument I had to play.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.626
Guys, Van...

19:41.628 --> 19:43.862
slash, Gabe, is right.

19:43.864 --> 19:47.032
I think we know the
sacrifice we need to make

19:47.034 --> 19:50.035
to get Emily back in here.

19:50.037 --> 19:52.070

So you really don't remember anything?

20:37.251 --> 20:39.150
No, it's a complete blank.

20:39.152 --> 20:42.306
So, even though we never
made it to Coast City,

20:42.309 --> 20:44.892
you guys really think it was
the best retreat you've ever had?

20:44.895 --> 20:46.157
Oh, for sure.

20:46.159 --> 20:48.193
And it was all thanks to you, Emily.

20:48.195 --> 20:49.761
Thanks, Emily.

20:49.763 --> 20:51.963
Aw, guys, come on. You
don't need to thank me.

20:51.965 --> 20:53.698
Sure.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.656
You know, we appreciate
how much you do for us,

20:55.659 --> 20:57.225
but, like, you don't have to.

20:57.228 --> 20:58.103
You're family.

20:58.105 --> 20:59.905
We love you no matter what.

20:59.907 --> 21:01.907
Plus we'd hate for you
to go all psycho on us.

21:03.677 --> 21:06.577
I don't even know what
that would look like.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.113
But maybe you're right.

21:08.115 --> 21:10.115
I do need to be able to trust you guys,

21:10.117 --> 21:12.117
and that's part of being a family too.

21:12.119 --> 21:14.871
You know, we're thinking
about going to karaoke tonight.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.202
- Do you wanna...
- I'm in!

21:16.205 --> 21:18.382
I love karaoke.

21:18.385 --> 21:19.351
We figured.

21:19.354 --> 21:20.601
Can we sing Kelly Clarkson?

21:20.604 --> 21:22.360
Mm-hmm.

21:22.403 --> 21:23.972
Heh. That's funny.
