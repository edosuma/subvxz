00:18.310 --> 00:22.064
- Get off the stage!

00:22.147 --> 00:25.025
Okay, thank you! That was...
that was really something.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.319
- We'll be in touch.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.447
Well, I'm glad I don't have eardrums,
'cause they would be bleeding!

00:30.531 --> 00:32.115
I didn't think they were all bad.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.867

00:35.827 --> 00:37.037
Huh? Sorry.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.872
I was listening to Atomic Pink.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.582
Didn't hear any of that.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.209
Look, those acts were fine,

00:42.334 --> 00:45.087
but is fine really good enough
for the first concert

00:45.170 --> 00:47.047
in Brighton's new
and improved bandshell?

00:47.214 --> 00:50.634
No! We need something
that'll rock this town!

00:50.717 --> 00:51.635
Exactly!

00:51.718 --> 00:53.262
Like Kenny Star!

00:53.345 --> 00:55.097
- Who's Kenny Star?

00:55.180 --> 00:57.599
Kenny Star is Brighton's
biggest celebrity.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.476
Well, technically he was born
in Tuscaloosa,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.311
but his great-great grandmother's

01:01.395 --> 01:03.188
second cousin once removed
did summer school here,

01:03.272 --> 01:05.148
which means Kenny's basically
a Brightonian!

01:05.232 --> 01:07.609
- Check him out!

Never trust a musician.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.039
They'll listen to your
self-produced demo tapes,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.708
promise to make you a star,
then leave you standing in the rain

02:04.791 --> 02:05.876
with an acoustic guitar

02:05.959 --> 02:07.919
and a suitcase full of broken dreams.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.590
Uh... what?

02:11.715 --> 02:14.801
People! This guy is a huge celebrity!

02:14.885 --> 02:16.928
He's never stepping foot in Brighton!

02:17.012 --> 02:18.972
Oh, really? Wait 'til you see

02:19.056 --> 02:20.515
what I have planned!

02:20.599 --> 02:21.683
Ah!

02:21.767 --> 02:23.685
We're going to murder him!

02:23.769 --> 02:24.603
What? No!

02:24.686 --> 02:27.272
Right now Kenny's tour bus
is on its way to Cleveland,

02:27.356 --> 02:29.399
and we are going to intercept him!

02:29.483 --> 02:32.027
<i>Assuming Kenny is, as his song
states, an "ordinary man,"</i>

02:32.110 --> 02:33.987
<i>who weighs approximately 180 pounds,</i>

02:34.071 --> 02:36.531
and his tour bus, which
leaves from here at noon,

02:36.615 --> 02:38.033
traveling 65 miles an hour,

02:38.116 --> 02:38.992
<i>add in his insatiable need</i>

02:39.076 --> 02:40.577
<i>for a fresh cup of Colombian dark roast</i>

02:40.661 --> 02:41.828
<i>-every 3.2 hours,</i>

02:41.912 --> 02:44.539
factoring in a stiff easterly wind
from this high-pressure system,

02:44.623 --> 02:47.084
<i>and his need to stretch
his perfect porcelain legs</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:48.502
<i>-to avoid varicose veins,</i>

02:48.585 --> 02:50.462
he'll be arriving
at this highway rest stop

02:50.545 --> 02:52.255
near Brighton in exactly...

02:52.339 --> 02:54.383
- thirty minutes!
- Molly, that was...

02:54.466 --> 02:55.801
- Brilliant!
- Absolutely insane!

02:56.218 --> 02:58.845
Did you stay up all night
half-baking that plan?

03:00.931 --> 03:03.225
Huh? Sorry, I fell asleep with
my eyes open for a second.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.228
What'd you say? Oh, yes, right.
I stayed up all night working on this.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.772
Because Brighton deserves
the greatest concert ever!

03:08.855 --> 03:12.734
And when it comes to people we care about,
McGees go the extra mile!

03:12.818 --> 03:16.196
Well, I'm not a McGee,
and I hate extra miles!

03:16.279 --> 03:17.114
Count me out!

03:17.239 --> 03:18.949
Okay!

03:20.742 --> 03:23.203
Oh, Scratch!

03:23.286 --> 03:25.414
Nope. No-no-no-no-nope!

03:25.497 --> 03:27.582
This is kidnapping! I'm under duress!

03:27.666 --> 03:29.418
I hate this curse.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.171
- Now let's go get Kenny Star!

03:33.255 --> 03:34.673
- Kenny Star?

03:34.756 --> 03:35.757
Kenny Star?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.217
- Here?
- It's gonna be huge!

03:37.300 --> 03:39.553
There's going to be pyrotechnics, and...

03:39.636 --> 03:40.804
Acrobatics, and...

03:40.887 --> 03:42.973
- A real live eagle!

03:43.056 --> 03:46.393
<i>It's gonna be the greatest concert ever!
See you there, BBs!</i>

03:48.562 --> 03:49.855
Have you heard the big news?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.107
Kenny Star's playing
at the bandshell tonight!

03:52.190 --> 03:54.359
It's happening! It's finally happening!

03:54.568 --> 03:57.279
My hopes are as high
as my dreams right now!

03:57.362 --> 03:58.989
- Uh, actually--
- That's right!

03:59.072 --> 04:00.449
He will definitely be here,

04:00.532 --> 04:02.701
and you can count on it!

04:02.909 --> 04:05.495
What? Cat's out of the bag,
might as well feed it some mice!

04:12.627 --> 04:14.838
Well, well, well,
would you look at that?

04:15.839 --> 04:17.716
He's not here. Humph.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.304
Whoa.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.597
I'm sorry, you were saying?

04:25.140 --> 04:27.476
Somebody get me
a Colombian dark roast.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.227
Mister Star, you may not know this,

04:29.311 --> 04:32.856
but there's a whole town
full of extraordinarily ordinary people,

04:32.939 --> 04:36.735
just like you, who are counting on you
to make their wildest dreams come true.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.361
I'm talking about Brighton,

04:38.445 --> 04:41.740
home of the bravest Wilder Scouts,
awesomest junior softball team,

04:41.823 --> 04:43.742
and the most efficient
elderly construction

04:43.825 --> 04:45.118
crew you've ever seen!

04:45.202 --> 04:48.371
Please, Mister Star,
embrace your Brightonian roots

04:48.455 --> 04:51.208
and come play our newly
rebuilt bandshell tonight!

04:51.291 --> 04:55.545
Make your great-great grandma's
second cousin once removed proud!

04:55.629 --> 04:57.964
I don't know
who you are, little lady,

04:58.048 --> 05:01.468
but that was the most beautiful
speech I've ever heard.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.763
Just one problem. I'm not Kenny Star.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.349
I'm his stunt double.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.268
Oh!

05:10.977 --> 05:12.062
Hello? Kenny?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.022
Mm. Kenny?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.107
Um... where's Kenny?

05:16.191 --> 05:18.652
Thirty thousand feet in the air
on his private jet.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.656
Oh, I'm an ordinary man.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.450
I put my rhinestone britches
on one leg at a time

05:25.534 --> 05:26.743
just like everybody else.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.120
I'm sorry, miss,
but there's nothing I can do.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.372
Now if you'll excuse me,

05:30.497 --> 05:31.623
I have to use the restroom.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.297
How could this happen?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.216
I planned for everything...

05:41.299 --> 05:42.342
except for this.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.261
Now we don't have any band for tonight.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.222
That's music to my ears.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.224
'Cause I told you this
was a ridiculous idea!

05:49.307 --> 05:51.351
Listen, let's go grab some
ice cream sandwiches

05:51.434 --> 05:52.519
and beef jerky while we're here.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.729
I mean, we made the drive and all.

05:54.938 --> 05:55.814
Let's go.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.483
Another rock star, another broken dream.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.235
Best you learn this lesson early, kid.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.029
Wait, what? I mean, that... that's it?
You're giving up?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.155
Aren't you gonna, you know,

06:04.239 --> 06:07.158
be all positive
and optimistic and annoying?

06:07.242 --> 06:08.952
No, Scratch. I tried my best.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.245
And it didn't work.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.289
- I let everyone down.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.461
<i>When it comes to
the people we care about,</i>

06:18.545 --> 06:20.338
<i>McGees go the extra mile.</i>

06:20.422 --> 06:23.341
Nope! No, no, no! Get out of my head!
That's not what's happening here!

06:23.425 --> 06:24.426
<i>People we care about...</i>

06:24.509 --> 06:26.011
I don't care about anyone!

06:26.094 --> 06:27.387
And also, I can't hear you!

06:27.470 --> 06:28.847
- La la la la la!
<i>McGees go...</i>

06:28.930 --> 06:30.265
I'm not a McGee!

06:30.348 --> 06:33.351
. <i>..the extra mile!</i>
- No, no, no!

06:33.852 --> 06:36.605
Okay, fine! You win!

06:36.688 --> 06:37.772
I'll fix this!

06:37.856 --> 06:40.984
But it doesn't mean anything!

06:41.443 --> 06:45.405
Yow!

06:45.488 --> 06:46.990
I'll tell ya what!

06:48.241 --> 06:49.826
Plane is really fast.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.912
Nobody likes a showoff, sir!

06:52.120 --> 06:53.747
Okay!

06:53.830 --> 06:55.206
All right! Plan B.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.168
Ooh, a tour bus.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.879
I mean, bands all sound
the same these days, right?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.464
Yeah, they sure do, Scratch!

07:02.547 --> 07:03.632
You're great at this!

07:03.715 --> 07:04.591
Thanks, Plan B.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.800
Yeah, bud, no problem.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.302
Here when you need me.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.520
All that work Brighton put into
rebuilding the bandshell,

07:17.896 --> 07:19.648
and now I've ruined the big debut.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.816
Look, Molly, it's not that bad.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.944
I'm sure everyone will understand.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.322
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!

07:27.405 --> 07:28.531
Kenny!

07:28.615 --> 07:30.283
Good thing I got my new hip,

07:30.367 --> 07:33.870
'cause Patty is gonna shake it tonight!

07:34.120 --> 07:35.080
Oh, boy.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.706
You don't have to go up there by yourself.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.749
We'll go as a family.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.501
Thanks, Mom.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.170
But I must face the non-music alone.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.766
Uh, you sure this is the way to Cleveland?

07:54.849 --> 07:55.850
Uh, yep, Cleveland!

07:55.934 --> 07:58.853
The... land of Cleve,
that's where we're going!

08:02.691 --> 08:05.568
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!

08:07.445 --> 08:10.031
Hi... everyone.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.284
- So, good news and bad news.

08:13.368 --> 08:17.330
The good news is we're all
here, you know, together,

08:17.414 --> 08:19.124
and I am so happy...

08:20.750 --> 08:23.795
...to see all your many,
many smiling faces.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.922
Less talking, more rocking!

08:26.006 --> 08:27.382
Yes. So,

08:27.465 --> 08:28.675
the bad news...

08:44.232 --> 08:47.777
The truth is, I promised you a big star,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.863
- but I've made a terrible mistake.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.118
Well, time to get back to work.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.039
Everybody out, go, go, go!

08:59.122 --> 09:00.999
Get on stage now! Wait!

09:01.082 --> 09:01.916
I got a star!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.169
- M-maybe even more than one!
- What? Who?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.837
How should I know? Just go with it!

09:06.129 --> 09:09.174
You see,
I made the mistake of telling them

09:09.257 --> 09:11.593
that Brighton doesn't like to rock!

09:11.676 --> 09:15.013
No! We love to rock!

09:15.096 --> 09:18.349
Okay, well, now that we got that
cleared up, enjoy the show!

09:20.060 --> 09:22.645
Hello, Cleveland!

09:22.729 --> 09:26.941
Your city is smaller
