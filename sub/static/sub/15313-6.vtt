00:02.766 --> 00:04.825
If you're not good, I warn you,
he will kill you.

00:04.902 --> 00:06.334
We're good.

00:06.403 --> 00:08.463
We're the best you'll ever meet.

00:08.539 --> 00:11.167
Arrogant too! I like it.

00:14.879 --> 00:17.677
The rest when Hood is in my vaults.

00:44.744 --> 00:46.735
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.571
Ah, let's have a look.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.443
Ah!

00:52.520 --> 00:54.317
That'll scrub up nice.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.855
Good.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.123
- Thank you.
- OK.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.187
Bye now.

01:09.638 --> 01:11.435
Who'd have thought?

01:11.506 --> 01:13.997
An artist, masquerading as a butcher.

01:16.879 --> 01:18.847
What do you want?

01:20.416 --> 01:21.712
What is this?

01:21.784 --> 01:23.217
Beetroot?

01:23.286 --> 01:25.618
It's perfectly good meat.

01:25.688 --> 01:27.714
- Never hurt anyone.
- Then you eat it.

01:29.292 --> 01:30.919
- It's not cooked.
- Eat!

01:31.528 --> 01:32.825
Eat it!

01:34.098 --> 01:35.565
You sell this?

01:36.066 --> 01:39.696
People save for a month, they give everything
they have for a piece of meat for the children,

01:39.770 --> 01:41.135
and you give them this?

01:41.705 --> 01:43.833
The rancid leftovers from the castle kitchen?

01:44.475 --> 01:47.604
- They're my economy cuts.
- You'll get another kind of cut in a minute.

01:47.679 --> 01:51.171
Your economy cuts nearly poisoned
half of Locksley village.

01:52.050 --> 01:56.111
You've got enough for yourself now.

01:56.187 --> 01:58.179
Not a word!

02:02.528 --> 02:03.893
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:03.963 --> 02:06.728
- We've come for the Sheriff's order.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.064
It's all here.

02:09.136 --> 02:11.297
Outlaws in the storeroom!

02:12.806 --> 02:14.603
Storeroom.

02:18.778 --> 02:20.246
Aaargh!

02:20.314 --> 02:22.474
Stop him! Quickly!

02:36.797 --> 02:38.789
Master?

02:38.867 --> 02:41.097
The sewer? No!

02:41.937 --> 02:43.962
Oh, yes!

02:46.875 --> 02:50.039
Aaaargh...!

02:50.713 --> 02:52.907
Aaaargh!

02:53.683 --> 02:55.515
Oh! Ugh!

02:57.787 --> 02:59.085
Oh, lovely!

02:59.322 --> 03:01.416
Like a pig in slops.

03:01.492 --> 03:02.789
Well, then you should be happy.

03:02.859 --> 03:05.693
- What?
- That's what it means.

03:05.763 --> 03:08.357
A pig in slops, it means you're happy.

03:08.432 --> 03:10.731
I've never understood that.

03:10.802 --> 03:13.270
Why would anyone be happy in slop?

04:29.519 --> 04:31.612
Madam?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.383
I am the Abbess...

04:33.456 --> 04:36.688
The Abbess of Rufford.
I seek the protection of your Sheriff.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.160
What's happened?

04:38.229 --> 04:39.958
Pilgrimage...

04:40.031 --> 04:41.932
Outlaws in the forest...

04:42.000 --> 04:43.364
Outlaws.

04:44.736 --> 04:47.068
Take her to the castle, get a physician.

04:47.139 --> 04:48.697
I will return shortly.

04:49.775 --> 04:51.675
Thank you.

05:09.362 --> 05:12.799
I'm just a poor farmer.
I'm going into town to sell some goat's milk.

05:12.865 --> 05:16.768
- You will not make money.
- We won't make much.

05:16.837 --> 05:19.271
Just enough to keep me
and the orphan lad alive.

05:20.374 --> 05:21.966
You will not make anything.

05:22.042 --> 05:23.703
This is a male goat.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.511
Well, well! Poverty's not what it used to be.

05:30.585 --> 05:32.075
It's a family heirloom.

05:32.153 --> 05:34.883
Liars... we do not like.

05:34.956 --> 05:36.185
What is this?

05:36.258 --> 05:39.226
That is crown property.
And I am ordering you to put it back!

05:39.294 --> 05:41.627
Speaks grand for a farmer.

05:41.697 --> 05:43.528
More like a taxman to me.

05:43.599 --> 05:46.591
It's not too late
for everyone just to go on their way.

05:47.804 --> 05:49.134
Too late for you.

05:49.205 --> 05:50.571
Please, sir! No!

06:03.553 --> 06:05.545
Marian!

06:12.063 --> 06:14.828
Forgive me, I do not have
as much time as I had planned.

06:16.535 --> 06:18.628
I have a gift for you.

06:18.704 --> 06:20.763
Sir Guy. You bring too many gifts.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.474
My mother used to say...

06:24.543 --> 06:27.137
if you have wronged somebody,
or if they're upset,

06:27.212 --> 06:29.306
do not be proud, offer them friendship.

06:29.382 --> 06:32.407
If they reject you, offer a second time,
and a third until they accept.

06:32.484 --> 06:35.477
And that is what I intend to do with you.

06:36.156 --> 06:39.354
Please, I do not need gifts.

06:41.494 --> 06:42.928
No.

06:43.964 --> 06:45.988
You need a husband.

06:51.539 --> 06:54.269
This world is not safe for a woman alone.

06:57.044 --> 06:58.671
Outlaws.

07:00.015 --> 07:01.448
I can protect myself.

07:02.951 --> 07:04.942
Even pilgrims...

07:05.854 --> 07:08.584
There 's an Abbess at Nottingham, half dead.

07:08.657 --> 07:09.955
I must tend to her.

07:14.864 --> 07:16.729
Then I would not delay you.

07:18.701 --> 07:20.692
Good day.

07:22.539 --> 07:23.835
I will keep giving.

07:32.617 --> 07:35.279
- What have we got?
- Tax collector.

07:35.353 --> 07:36.877
Oh!

07:37.755 --> 07:39.450
Very good.

07:39.524 --> 07:41.890
At least get the facts straight.
I am a tax inspector.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.521
It's two grades higher than a tax collector.

07:44.596 --> 07:47.794
I do the bookwork,
I don't dirty my hands with the money.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.096
How can you be so proud?

07:52.505 --> 07:53.972
This is not taxation.

07:55.074 --> 07:56.166
This is extortion.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.403
I count the wealth of the world. I don't judge it.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.639
No, we judge it.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.444
This is 1192, my friend.
The time for heroes is gone.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.416
This is the age of the book-keeper now.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.713
These markings.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.951
They mean something.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.721
I will not divulge state secrets.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.392
- You! Put him down!
- Hey! Word of advice, mate.

08:20.468 --> 08:21.799
Be nice to Little John.

08:21.869 --> 08:25.430
- Put my father down. He has a weak heart!
- Your father?

08:27.408 --> 08:28.637
John!

08:28.710 --> 08:30.768
Let the gentleman down.

08:34.683 --> 08:36.616
What state secrets?

08:39.489 --> 08:40.784
John?

08:43.092 --> 08:44.491
Leave him alone!

08:44.561 --> 08:48.623
We do not like it when people hold back on us.
Now, tell me.

08:48.698 --> 08:50.689
What state secrets?

08:56.607 --> 08:59.804
Gisborne seemed angry.
What did you say to him?

08:59.877 --> 09:01.970
I said I would marry him and have his children.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.177
You could do worse.

09:04.248 --> 09:06.649
Yes, if I married the Sheriff.

09:06.717 --> 09:08.810
I would sooner be a nun than Gisborne's wife.

09:09.553 --> 09:11.454
When is this willfulness going to stop?

09:11.523 --> 09:14.321
- Not to mention the other nonsense?
- What other nonsense?

09:14.392 --> 09:17.884
- The Night Rider or whatever you call yourself.
- I do not call myself anything.

09:17.963 --> 09:19.760
They say Nightwatchman.

09:19.832 --> 09:23.563
It is dangerous. It is foolish.
And I have forbidden it.

09:25.037 --> 09:26.937
Father, I must do what I can.

09:27.006 --> 09:29.702
The poor cannot feed themselves,
their children...

09:29.775 --> 09:31.470
I forbid it.

09:31.544 --> 09:33.011
Your hair was a warning.

09:33.079 --> 09:34.445
Next time you will hang.

09:35.048 --> 09:36.413
That is my problem.

09:36.483 --> 09:38.383
How can you be so selfish?

09:38.452 --> 09:40.215
It is my neck.

09:41.889 --> 09:45.256
I am your father. This is my house and...

09:45.326 --> 09:46.953
You fear for your own neck.

09:47.028 --> 09:48.928
That is the truth.

09:51.065 --> 09:53.727
If you cannot obey me, if you...

09:53.801 --> 09:55.735
I cannot obey you.

09:59.742 --> 10:01.710
Then you leave this house.

10:11.086 --> 10:14.022
If I tell you, how do I know
you're not just going to kill us anyway?

10:14.090 --> 10:16.422
- You don't.
- That's not much of a deal.

10:16.493 --> 10:19.860
Well, in the real world,
things don't always add up.

10:20.897 --> 10:23.298
- Very original.
- But true.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.739
The tax money for the whole of the north...

10:33.811 --> 10:35.779
is being held in Nottingham castle.

10:41.820 --> 10:43.185
All of it?

10:43.255 --> 10:47.784
The Sheriff has the trust of the Prince. He has
been Annual Collector for the last three years.

10:47.859 --> 10:52.092
That's true. My father used to make
extra strongboxes this time of year.

10:52.165 --> 10:54.155
In case you have any ideas,

10:54.232 --> 10:57.202
Prince John sends a unit of his army
to protect the shipment.

10:57.270 --> 10:58.669
And yet he does not protect you?

10:58.738 --> 11:01.730
Hmph! I do not move the money.
I merely count it.

11:01.808 --> 11:06.269
Check it out as it leaves Nottingham,
check it in as it arrives in London.

11:06.346 --> 11:08.075
Good.

11:10.918 --> 11:12.408
Master...

11:14.188 --> 11:16.521
No, surely...

11:16.591 --> 11:19.525
Robin... The castle's as tight as leeches' lips.

11:19.593 --> 11:21.425
You're scared.

11:21.496 --> 11:24.988
Well, yeah.
Look, I've dangled from a rope there.

11:25.066 --> 11:27.467
- Not funny.
- I want that money.

11:28.937 --> 11:30.929
I want that money before it gets to London.

11:31.006 --> 11:32.803
Do you think taxes pay for themselves?

11:32.875 --> 11:35.969
People sweat for them.
Give their lives for them.

11:36.045 --> 11:39.412
And when they save up enough,
they can't even afford a decent piece of meat.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.410
My friend here lost his mother.

11:42.485 --> 11:45.182
- It's not my fault.
- You're part of the system.

11:46.089 --> 11:48.614
Taxes we do not like.

11:48.692 --> 11:50.626
It's one of our bugbears.

11:50.694 --> 11:53.630
We'd give that money back
to the people it was stolen from.

11:54.097 --> 11:55.429
Where in the castle?

11:57.701 --> 12:00.830
In the vault.
Maximum security. You'd never get in.

12:00.905 --> 12:03.499
Yeah, you're right. We wouldn't...

12:03.574 --> 12:05.269
May I say, I am relieved!

12:05.344 --> 12:10.805
I mean, as much as I want to see that money
returned to the people, I just think that...

12:10.882 --> 12:14.545
We wouldn't get in, but you...

12:15.087 --> 12:16.384
you would.

12:18.791 --> 12:24.525
- She was leading a pilgrimage to Canterbury.
- Ah, Canterbury, Canterbury. Thomas A Becket.

12:24.596 --> 12:26.462
Everybody loves a martyr.

12:26.533 --> 12:28.694
Her retinue were robbed
and scattered to the four winds.

12:28.768 --> 12:30.963
She's been stumbling
through the forest all night.

12:31.037 --> 12:33.597
Aww! No servants?

12:33.673 --> 12:36.198
No adoring novice nuns? Poor thing.

12:36.276 --> 12:40.475
- I have some sympathy.
- Well, don't.

12:41.448 --> 12:45.714
They call themselves
Father Abbot and Mother Superior.

12:45.786 --> 12:47.618
They call themselves by parents' names

12:47.689 --> 12:50.123
so that we don't notice them
getting fat at our expense.

12:50.192 --> 12:52.217
They are...

12:53.261 --> 12:56.162
parasites dressed as pious.

13:00.336 --> 13:05.740
There are worse things
to dress up as than pious, my Lord.

13:05.808 --> 13:08.834
Ah, that remark was not meant for you.

13:08.911 --> 13:11.778
- I think it was.
- Yes...

13:11.848 --> 13:16.046
Yes, it was. For people like you. What can I say?

13:17.187 --> 13:18.518
I'm not sorry.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.985
Then I cannot grant you forgiveness.

13:22.726 --> 13:26.287
Oh, where you come from,
that must be a devastating thing to withhold.

13:26.363 --> 13:27.660
But here...

13:30.235 --> 13:34.672
I've no intentions of being a parasite
in your castle, my Lord. Pious or otherwise.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.541
I shall be leaving forthwith.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.238
Good. I wish you a safe onward journey.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.707
I've sent one of your messengers to Rufford.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.979
Assuming the outlaws you are so
clearly incapable of controlling

13:47.052 --> 13:48.542
allow him to get through,

13:48.621 --> 13:51.146
a retinue will arrive to escort me home directly.

13:52.091 --> 13:57.359
I've given instructions for funds to be brought.
You will be paid for your... hospitality.

13:57.429 --> 13:59.591
Oh!

14:01.101 --> 14:04.594
Er, monies raised here
go directly to support the King and his army,

14:04.671 --> 14:07.401
Funds raised by the Church
go to the glorification of God.

14:07.474 --> 14:09.067
Not war.

14:09.143 --> 14:11.076
Ah! Just as I thought.

14:11.144 --> 14:15.081
It is meant to be a Holy War but it is paid for
out of my taxes, not yours,

14:15.149 --> 14:16.616
Mother!

14:16.684 --> 14:20.051
I had heard Nottingham under your stewardship
was a godless place.

14:20.689 --> 14:22.713
I had no idea how godless.

14:22.790 --> 14:26.420
Yes, I know.
I should have been struck down by now.

14:27.863 --> 14:31.390
I hope you're still here for dinner. No charge.

14:46.016 --> 14:47.950
- This is your chapel?
- I'm sorry, my Lady.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.008
The chapel is out of bounds.

14:51.855 --> 14:54.380
We do not know for sure it was Hood.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.619
The Abbess was very clear.

14:56.694 --> 14:58.992
Does it matter? We just blame him anyway.

14:59.063 --> 15:00.894
Robin Hood, pilgrim robber.

15:03.101 --> 15:06.593
No. I want Hood to be comfortable...

15:08.039 --> 15:10.837
confident... bold.

15:12.544 --> 15:13.978
Do you have a scheme?

15:18.551 --> 15:23.012
Sir, you may be comfortable
with godlessness, I am not.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.990
I am comfortable with godlessness.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.460
In fact, I would hate to be...

15:29.528 --> 15:32.498
godlessness-less.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.469
I am denied access to your chapel,

15:37.538 --> 15:39.801
and so I am denied access to my god.

15:39.873 --> 15:42.934
Whether you accept it or not,
he is your god too.

15:43.011 --> 15:45.774
Currently my God has another use
for the chapel.

15:47.882 --> 15:50.316
There can be only one use for a chapel.

15:50.385 --> 15:52.786
Hm. Well, today there are two.

15:58.894 --> 16:00.885
Let me see what I can do.

16:28.793 --> 16:30.728
Staying for long, sir?

16:32.564 --> 16:35.362
Depends on how much money you
have got for us to count.

16:36.735 --> 16:39.135
That your same boy? Frederick?

16:39.204 --> 16:40.569
Cedric.

16:42.140 --> 16:44.371
Cedric.

16:44.444 --> 16:46.002
I'll get you an escort, gents.

16:52.919 --> 16:55.252
Taxes in the chapel of the Lord.

16:56.190 --> 16:57.589
I love irony.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.667
Good.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.032
Let the lady get on her knees to her god.

17:12.073 --> 17:15.406
My Lord, is this safe?
If something were to go wrong...

17:15.477 --> 17:17.000
- Post two more guards.
- Yes, my Lord.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.069
She's only a nun.

17:20.848 --> 17:22.680
Ah! Forgive me if I don't join you.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.015
- You want forgiveness now?
- It was a turn of phrase.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.054
Or was it your conscience talking?

17:29.758 --> 17:31.419
I don't know. Have I got a conscience?

17:32.928 --> 17:35.328
You like to spar with words.

17:36.932 --> 17:39.163
I like to spar with actions too.

17:40.436 --> 17:42.029
- You forgive me.
- What for?

17:42.105 --> 17:44.073
For not praying for your soul.

17:46.644 --> 17:47.940
I can see you.

17:49.045 --> 17:51.014
What?

17:51.082 --> 17:53.676
I can see you.

17:53.751 --> 17:57.949
Underneath all that
Mother Superior performance,

17:59.090 --> 18:00.956
there 's a naughty little girl,

18:01.026 --> 18:03.186
isn't there? Hm? Am I right?

18:03.427 --> 18:06.794
Underneath all the haughty,
there 's quite a bit of naughty.

18:06.865 --> 18:08.230
How dare you?

18:10.769 --> 18:13.739
I think you probably like to spar with words.

18:14.907 --> 18:18.207
I think you probably like to spar
with actions too.

18:23.449 --> 18:24.780
Ouch...

18:26.619 --> 18:29.783
The door will be locked,
so knock if you want to get out.

18:29.857 --> 18:33.588
You're locking me in?!
In the chapel of the Lord?

19:25.583 --> 19:27.210
- Money! Please!
- My Lady!

19:27.285 --> 19:30.551
- Please!
- My children are starving!

19:30.622 --> 19:31.816
Please!

19:34.126 --> 19:36.856
Help! Somebody help me!

19:36.928 --> 19:39.796
- Somebody help me, please!
- Break it up! Break it up!

19:44.503 --> 19:49.271
Don't have anything to do with them,
your Ladyship. You don't belong with that sort.

19:56.016 --> 19:58.109
Your escort, sir.

20:06.927 --> 20:09.589
Ah... The taxman cometh.

20:21.978 --> 20:24.502
That was impressive. Thank you.

20:24.580 --> 20:27.378
Seeing as you owe me one, can we talk?

20:27.450 --> 20:29.576
No...

20:29.652 --> 20:31.779
Master, our mission!

20:32.555 --> 20:33.522
One minute...

20:39.495 --> 20:41.258
What mission?

20:41.331 --> 20:43.493
You will find out soon enough.

20:45.903 --> 20:47.131
Do you have a problem?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.036
More than I can say in one minute.

20:50.974 --> 20:55.570
This life, this pretence, is driving me mad.

20:55.646 --> 20:59.082
Gisborne sniffs around me like a little spaniel.

20:59.150 --> 21:00.947
My father would have me marry him

21:01.019 --> 21:04.079
for fear of anyone guessing we are not wholly
in league with the Sheriff.

21:04.155 --> 21:08.752
As for the Nightwatchman, it is not enough for
me and it is much too much for my father.

21:08.828 --> 21:10.818
What I want, who I am...

21:11.897 --> 21:13.558
does not count.

21:16.669 --> 21:18.933
I am sick of it all.

21:19.004 --> 21:21.097
I'm leaving home.

21:21.174 --> 21:23.471
To go... where?

21:24.678 --> 21:26.771
I do not know.

21:26.847 --> 21:28.839
That is unwise.

21:29.684 --> 21:34.552
I am sick of people and it is always men
telling me what is wise and what is not.

21:34.622 --> 21:36.213
Then tell me what it is you want.

21:36.289 --> 21:40.557
Help! I want somebody, for once,
to think about how they can help me.

21:40.628 --> 21:43.097
Help me to do what I want to do,

21:43.165 --> 21:45.099
what I think is wise.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.225
Master!

21:48.170 --> 21:51.105
- I have to go.
- Of course you do.

21:51.173 --> 21:53.403
- I have to go too.
- Master!

21:55.177 --> 21:57.270
We will continue this conversation.

21:58.180 --> 22:00.149
I'd like to help.

22:00.917 --> 22:02.908
No need.

22:05.054 --> 22:06.521
I've made my decision.

22:12.529 --> 22:14.589
Ah, Gisborne.

22:14.665 --> 22:17.725
Marian wants to petition
our visiting Mother Superior.

22:17.802 --> 22:19.429
What for?

22:19.503 --> 22:22.905
To borrow a pound.
What do you think? To become a nun.

22:24.341 --> 22:26.367
Oh.

22:26.445 --> 22:27.809
Really?

22:29.848 --> 22:31.281
A nun?

22:32.984 --> 22:35.613
My father is displeased with me.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.848
In the abbey I could learn obedience.

22:37.923 --> 22:39.721
But surely there are other ways.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.793
Go and knock on her ladyship's door.
She's in the chapel.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.525
Tell the guards I sent you.

23:03.050 --> 23:05.144
Mother?

23:05.220 --> 23:08.712
Forgive this intrusion.
I have a request to make of you.

23:08.790 --> 23:10.655
Speak quickly, child.

23:10.725 --> 23:12.158
It is a difficult matter...

23:12.227 --> 23:14.525
Quickly or not at all.

23:15.697 --> 23:17.131
Very well.

23:17.199 --> 23:19.667
I should like to be a novice in your order.

23:20.703 --> 23:23.672
Come to my abbey in a month.
I will consider you then.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.641
With respect, you are here today.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.701
Consider me now.

23:30.413 --> 23:31.709
You are bold.

23:33.183 --> 23:34.650
Do you know who I am?

23:34.718 --> 23:36.811
Forgive me. I am bold.

23:36.887 --> 23:39.721
That is why I do not belong here. It is stifling.

23:39.789 --> 23:42.315
You think an abbey is a place to be bold?

23:42.393 --> 23:44.553
I think it is a place to breathe.

23:45.395 --> 23:47.955
I should like to be clear.
I would stay for a year at most,

23:48.031 --> 23:49.556
and I can fund my keep.

23:49.634 --> 23:51.864
Forgive me, something about you.

23:51.936 --> 23:54.132
You are an unlikely novice.

23:54.206 --> 23:56.298
You are an unlikely abbess.

23:57.041 --> 23:59.476
You are spirited.

23:59.545 --> 24:01.911
I could use someone like you.

24:02.881 --> 24:05.247
I have no intention of being used.

24:18.932 --> 24:20.332
Aargh!

24:26.407 --> 24:27.374
Will!

24:45.060 --> 24:47.153
I hate this.

24:51.867 --> 24:53.994
So, did she agree?

24:56.405 --> 24:57.702
Yes.

25:00.744 --> 25:03.713
I'm surprised you've not
mentioned this to me before.

25:03.779 --> 25:05.111
Should I have?

25:06.582 --> 25:07.880
Yeah.

25:08.585 --> 25:10.678
It is done now.

25:10.754 --> 25:13.086
I leave with her when her retinue comes.

25:13.156 --> 25:14.953
Tonight, probably.

25:15.460 --> 25:16.721
I must pack my things.

25:18.730 --> 25:20.026
I thought we were friends.

25:22.567 --> 25:25.035
I thought in time you would consider...

25:27.472 --> 25:28.770
What?

25:30.074 --> 25:31.474
Marriage.

25:38.018 --> 25:40.452
That you would consider...

25:41.754 --> 25:44.450
Perhaps I am not the marrying kind.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.058
But you will be a bride of Christ?

25:50.598 --> 25:53.396
It was a difficult decision, I confess.

26:14.089 --> 26:16.182
Now, listen here, I've played my part.

26:16.258 --> 26:18.226
- What about my son?
- Quiet.

26:18.293 --> 26:20.159
- No. I have to know he's safe.
- Enough!

26:31.441 --> 26:32.703
Oi!

26:38.849 --> 26:41.283
You're wasting your time.
We've been tricked.

26:57.569 --> 26:58.866
- Clever.
- But it's true.

26:58.937 --> 27:02.374
The taxes of the north do come
through Nottingham. Every year at this time.

27:02.441 --> 27:04.136
I helped make these chests.

27:04.210 --> 27:05.734
That's why it was clever.

27:06.445 --> 27:09.312
An inch of truth makes the lie hard to spot.

27:09.381 --> 27:12.009
I knew we shouldn't have done this! I said!

27:12.084 --> 27:13.677
Shh!

27:13.754 --> 27:15.187
Let me think.

27:18.592 --> 27:20.219
We're going to hang now.

27:20.293 --> 27:21.954
We are not going to hang!

27:26.167 --> 27:27.759
Master, what do we do?

27:28.770 --> 27:30.066
I have a plan.

27:30.137 --> 27:31.571
No, you don't.

27:32.807 --> 27:34.503
You're right.

27:34.575 --> 27:36.042
I don't.

27:39.615 --> 27:40.843
I've got a plan.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.591
As promised.

27:56.666 --> 27:59.863
Robin Hood is in your vault. And retinue.

27:59.936 --> 28:02.337
Hood? How?

28:02.406 --> 28:04.737
- With all the tax chests?
- Moved for the occasion.

28:04.808 --> 28:08.404
Gisborne, this is Flaxton. Give him a big kiss.

28:08.479 --> 28:11.505
He's achieved something
none of us could manage.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.077
Well, come along.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.120
Let's go and gloat.

28:17.188 --> 28:20.589
Before that... if you could settle
the remainder of my payment?

28:20.658 --> 28:21.990
I have risked my life.

28:22.060 --> 28:23.925
I haven't taken delivery yet.

28:23.995 --> 28:25.758
He's not going anywhere.

28:25.831 --> 28:29.130
It's just that I'm not keen
to stick around for the trial.

28:30.802 --> 28:33.738
A trial? How quaint.

28:33.806 --> 28:37.741
You'll be paid. Gisborne, make the
arrangements. Five hundred pounds.

28:37.810 --> 28:39.107
Really?

28:41.480 --> 28:44.939
We weren't allowed to fit the locks on these.
They had to be the best.

28:45.017 --> 28:47.111
As good as the castle locks.

28:47.187 --> 28:48.916
What does that mean?

28:50.057 --> 28:53.549
It means they might well
be made by the same locksmith.

28:55.295 --> 28:58.231
I don't suppose there 's any point
telling you to hurry up?

28:58.299 --> 29:00.597
- No.
- Right.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.718
Guards!

30:32.067 --> 30:33.125
Cluster ball!

30:37.807 --> 30:40.866
Stop! Stop! Stop!

30:40.942 --> 30:42.534
No one has to die here today!

30:44.680 --> 30:46.807
I think you know how this goes.

30:48.517 --> 30:50.178
How much did you pay him?

30:50.252 --> 30:52.277
He was surprisingly cheap.

30:52.355 --> 30:55.017
Did you really think he was a tax inspector?

30:55.091 --> 30:57.617
Was it enough to sacrifice his boy's life?

30:57.693 --> 31:00.788
You can kill him if you like.
Nobody will miss him, least of all me.

31:00.864 --> 31:04.300
- You are revolting.
- Yes. I am godless, aren't I?

31:04.368 --> 31:06.233
Let's finish this here, Hood.

31:06.303 --> 31:08.465
Forget the Sheriff, forget the soldiers.
Just you and me.

31:08.538 --> 31:10.131
Sorry, Gisborne.

31:10.208 --> 31:12.642
Trial by combat's not big and it's not clever.

31:12.710 --> 31:16.806
- So you are a coward.
- I am no coward.

31:16.881 --> 31:21.148
I just do not trust you. Or them.
Now, step aside.

31:21.219 --> 31:23.586
Only a coward would steal from pilgrims!

31:23.655 --> 31:24.985
What pilgrims?

31:25.057 --> 31:26.648
Defenseless women!

31:26.725 --> 31:29.694
Women in holy orders!
Who's showing their breeding now, eh?

31:29.762 --> 31:31.593
Step aside.

31:32.598 --> 31:34.725
Now!

31:41.541 --> 31:42.804
Do you know about this?

31:42.876 --> 31:45.640
Pilgrims? I haven't touched any pilgrims.

31:45.712 --> 31:47.078
- John?
- No.

31:51.985 --> 31:54.614
The Abbess of Rufford is still alive,
no thanks to you.

31:54.688 --> 31:56.485
Never heard of her.

31:56.557 --> 32:00.152
But he dies unless you drop the portcullis!

32:02.763 --> 32:04.823
Now!

32:09.971 --> 32:12.667
A taxman that isn't a taxman,

32:12.741 --> 32:15.802
pilgrims no one's ever heard of...

32:15.878 --> 32:17.778
I think we've both been had.

32:21.317 --> 32:23.717
Get after them!

32:38.902 --> 32:40.893
No!

32:42.240 --> 32:44.230
No!

32:48.913 --> 32:50.608
Mother...

32:50.682 --> 32:52.207
Superior!

33:18.246 --> 33:20.543
She was not the Abbess of Rufford.

33:22.215 --> 33:23.478
No.

33:41.871 --> 33:43.167
You look like a boy.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.305
You look like a girl.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.967
If my father is hurt...

33:47.043 --> 33:48.840
What will you do? Cry?

33:49.579 --> 33:52.639
Maybe. Wouldn't you, if it was your father?

33:52.715 --> 33:56.208
My father was killed by you English.

33:56.287 --> 33:57.583
Crusaders!

33:58.588 --> 33:59.920
Then you know how I feel.

33:59.990 --> 34:04.927
I was brought to this country as a slave,
tied up like an animal.

34:04.995 --> 34:06.690
Have sympathy with me.

34:06.764 --> 34:10.165
And on that journey,
I learned every way there is...

34:10.234 --> 34:13.966
of trying talk my way out of bondage.

34:15.106 --> 34:16.402
So save your breath.

34:17.609 --> 34:19.235
You can't blame me for trying.

34:44.838 --> 34:47.170
- We've been tricked.
- How?

34:47.241 --> 34:49.801
- He's not really a tax man.
- Shh!

34:49.876 --> 34:52.572
It's not just us, the Sheriff's been tricked too.

34:52.646 --> 34:55.137
Yeah, how do we know that exactly?

34:55.783 --> 34:58.217
- The inch of truth.
- What?

34:59.420 --> 35:00.978
The money.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.990
The bit about the tax money was true.

35:03.058 --> 35:05.856
- And?
- Anybody as good as our friendly tax inspector

35:05.928 --> 35:09.193
wouldn't settle for a few pounds
for catching some outlaws.

35:09.265 --> 35:11.927
Not when the whole of the tax money
for the north is on offer.

35:12.935 --> 35:14.732
So...

35:14.804 --> 35:16.567
So, Djaq.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.574
You go back. Untie him.

35:19.642 --> 35:21.371
Let him overpower you.

35:21.443 --> 35:24.106
Now, we will follow him and if I am right...

35:25.215 --> 35:27.911
he will lead us to some very wealthy crooks.

35:27.984 --> 35:30.350
No need. Look.

35:37.595 --> 35:38.926
Clever beggar!

35:43.602 --> 35:46.036
That is weird!

35:46.104 --> 35:48.129
It's like a circus act.

35:52.444 --> 35:54.435
Ah, that is horrible.

35:59.451 --> 36:01.784
Ohh! Come on!

36:01.854 --> 36:03.879
Three groups.

36:03.956 --> 36:06.015
Switch pursuit. Silent running.

36:06.092 --> 36:07.491
Go!

36:11.432 --> 36:13.195
You are really going?

36:13.267 --> 36:16.065
I have an arrangement
with the Abbess of Rufford.

36:19.773 --> 36:21.765
What would I have to do
to persuade you to stay?

36:21.842 --> 36:23.639
It's too late.

36:23.711 --> 36:25.703
I meet the Abbess in the castle in an hour.

36:25.780 --> 36:27.337
She expects her retinue tonight.

36:27.415 --> 36:29.940
Surely it is never too late
between a father and a daughter?

36:30.786 --> 36:32.776
What can I do?

36:37.893 --> 36:42.592
Support me, as the Nightwatchman.
I want to do more, not less.

36:42.665 --> 36:44.895
Protect me from the Gisbornes of this world.

36:44.967 --> 36:46.559
Accept me.

36:46.635 --> 36:48.570
The daughter you have.

36:48.638 --> 36:50.538
Not the daughter you wanted.

36:51.741 --> 36:53.107
And if I cannot?

36:53.176 --> 36:55.542
Then I go to meet the Abbess.

36:56.780 --> 36:59.716
- Those are your terms?
- Those are my terms.

36:59.783 --> 37:01.717
I'm sorry.

37:03.755 --> 37:07.589
The Nightwatchman may as well
put a noose around both our necks.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.391
Goodbye.

37:13.464 --> 37:15.558
Wait.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.828
If you feel that strongly...

37:21.640 --> 37:22.971
You will support me?

37:24.978 --> 37:26.467
I have no choice.

37:28.781 --> 37:30.476
Then I will stay.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.156
Gisborne came to see you.

37:39.226 --> 37:42.093
Just now. I sent him away.

37:43.931 --> 37:45.864
He will be back.

37:45.933 --> 37:47.924
We will be strong.

38:14.597 --> 38:15.894
Woah!

38:17.633 --> 38:19.966
Welcome back, lad. Woah!

38:20.037 --> 38:21.436
Tell me we are in business.

38:22.972 --> 38:24.338
No.

38:24.408 --> 38:26.103
Oh.

38:26.176 --> 38:27.973
Not unless we want to be!

38:28.045 --> 38:31.208
We will never have to be in business again!

38:31.683 --> 38:34.208
Come on, boy.
Come and sit next to your retirement.

38:37.188 --> 38:39.349
No retirements just yet.

38:39.424 --> 38:41.289
- Is this him?
- You should be dead!

38:41.359 --> 38:43.759
- Many times over.
- How did you escape?

38:43.828 --> 38:45.796
Oh, a wriggle and a pop of the shoulders.

38:45.864 --> 38:48.800
I told you, always check the tail.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.733
Listen. We've not taken from you.

38:50.802 --> 38:53.966
- We were never after you.
- No. We were just the bait.

38:54.039 --> 38:55.802
Get over it.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.537
You get over it.
You might as well have been tax collectors.

38:58.612 --> 39:00.580
- You do exactly the same thing.
- You can talk.

39:00.647 --> 39:02.739
You live on the wrong side of the law
just like us.

39:02.816 --> 39:05.341
That is because the law
has itself become criminal.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.545
England is rotting from the top down.

39:08.622 --> 39:09.987
Then why stay?

39:10.056 --> 39:13.117
We were going to Holland
to set ourselves up as nobles.

39:13.194 --> 39:16.755
Why not join us?
We'd make a wonderful combination.

39:18.900 --> 39:22.063
There are many more fools like the Sheriff
of Nottingham in this world.

39:22.136 --> 39:24.468
It is our duty to cheat them.

39:24.539 --> 39:28.442
They're greedy.
That's why they are so easy to trick.

39:28.510 --> 39:34.779
Join us. With our strategies
and your remarkable talents...

39:39.821 --> 39:41.915
It would be so different.

39:41.991 --> 39:44.619
Forget the others, just you and me.

39:46.262 --> 39:47.786
What's he doing?

39:50.167 --> 39:51.964
Now you see what I have to put up with?

39:52.036 --> 39:53.663
What do you say?

39:55.805 --> 39:57.774
I say...

39:59.977 --> 40:01.604
Little John.

40:03.113 --> 40:04.513
What?

40:08.987 --> 40:10.648
You are pigs.

40:10.722 --> 40:12.713
And you are in slops.

40:12.791 --> 40:15.919
But I think you'll find
they are not pigs in slops!

40:16.628 --> 40:18.425
What else have we got here?

40:22.368 --> 40:24.563
You wouldn't have wanted to retire on this.

40:28.574 --> 40:29.872
Dirty money.

40:43.123 --> 40:45.354
May I say I'm glad to see you there?

40:45.426 --> 40:48.189
You have said it. If you will excuse me.

40:56.138 --> 41:02.168
When you said that you would go to Rufford,
I admit, I was disturbed.

41:02.244 --> 41:08.376
Sir Guy, have I ever indicated that you would
have a right to be disturbed?

41:09.653 --> 41:12.087
Well, I would like to earn that right.

41:12.155 --> 41:14.452
And I'm glad that I still have the chance.

41:15.492 --> 41:18.792
The so-called Abbess. She was an impostor.

41:19.996 --> 41:21.362
Pardon?

41:22.565 --> 41:26.092
I came straightaway.
I told your father. Did he not tell you?

41:28.139 --> 41:30.573
No.

41:30.641 --> 41:33.508
I think maybe he was being kind to me.

41:35.212 --> 41:37.840
There are other people
who would like to be kind to you.

41:40.651 --> 41:42.244
If you would let them.

41:55.368 --> 41:58.428
I saw him coming.
I would have headed him off.

41:58.505 --> 41:59.994
He told me.

42:02.508 --> 42:05.603
- It makes no difference.
- Yes, it does.

42:05.679 --> 42:09.137
I had nowhere to run.
You did not need to agree to my terms.

42:12.186 --> 42:15.623
Irealized that the daughter I had
was the daughter I wanted.

42:26.201 --> 42:27.600
Good morning!

42:28.837 --> 42:31.705
I have a proposition for you.

42:31.774 --> 42:33.866
The next time you have meat
to take to Nottingham,

42:33.942 --> 42:37.435
you take it to the village of Locksley,
you take it to the village of Wadlow,

42:37.513 --> 42:39.141
you take it to the village of Clun.

42:40.483 --> 42:42.509
What are you trying to do?
Feed the world?

42:42.586 --> 42:44.247
Don't give me ideas.

42:44.321 --> 42:47.154
Good morning! A proposition for you...

42:47.224 --> 42:51.024
The next time you have meat for the market,
you take it to the village of Nettlestone.

42:52.129 --> 42:56.191
Now, I am paying you over the odds,
I am paying you in advance.

42:56.267 --> 42:58.531
For this year and the next.

42:59.670 --> 43:01.137
Do you know who I am?

43:01.205 --> 43:02.172
I am Robin Hood.

43:02.240 --> 43:03.207
Don't let me down.

43:04.305 --> 43:10.246
