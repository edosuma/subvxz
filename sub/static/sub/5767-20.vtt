WEBVTT

00:06.400 --> 00:09.335
MAN (singsongy):
He could be president.
(laughs): Oh, please, stop.

00:09.370 --> 00:11.668
What? He's
handsome enough.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.735
He's certainly
tall enough.

00:13.780 --> 00:17.204
Oh, Peter isn't even sure
if he's running for governor.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.706
Oh, he'll run
for governor.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.308
I don't know.

00:20.350 --> 00:22.284
He has to decide by next week.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.288
ALICIA:
Hello, Jackie.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.085
Alicia.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.678
You have a moment?

00:28.720 --> 00:31.359
I do.

00:38.670 --> 00:41.537
I haven't seen you
for a while, Alicia.

00:41.570 --> 00:43.709
How are you?
Why, Jackie?
Why'd you do it?

00:43.740 --> 00:45.537
Why did I... do it?

00:45.570 --> 00:46.798
The house.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.172
The house Zach
and Grace grew up in.

00:49.210 --> 00:51.542
The house I lived in
for 13 years.

00:51.580 --> 00:54.174
Why did... I put a
down payment on it?
Yes.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.085
I didn't want
to see It go

00:56.120 --> 00:57.348
to another family.
You knew I put

00:57.390 --> 00:59.210
an offer on it,
and you didn't want

00:59.260 --> 01:00.454
me to get it.
1-1 was visiting

01:00.490 --> 01:01.718
a friend in Highland Park,

01:01.760 --> 01:04.228
and I saw the "for
sale" srgn, and...

01:04.260 --> 01:06.399
I decided to put a
down payment on it.

01:06.430 --> 01:09.297
Because you just so happened
to need a four-bedroom,

01:09.330 --> 01:12.299
3,400-square-foot house?
No, it's not for me.
It's for Peter

01:12.340 --> 01:14.399
and the kids.
We struggled for
three years, Jackie.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.408
We lost our home.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.362
We took Zach and Grace
out of school.

01:18.410 --> 01:19.570
Where was_ all
this generOSIty...

01:19.610 --> 01:23.205
Alicia, I offered you
a place in my home,

01:23.250 --> 01:24.774
I offered you loans,

01:24.810 --> 01:27.813
and every time you said,
"I want to do it on my own."

01:27.850 --> 01:30.216
Well, I don't have
that many years left,

01:30.250 --> 01:32.582
and I'd like to leave
something for my children.

01:32.620 --> 01:34.383
And you'll live there
with them.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.183
What?
You're giving

01:36.230 --> 01:37.356
Peter and the kids the house,

01:37.390 --> 01:39.119
and you will
live there with them.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.650
I don't know.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.292
I-I don't want to presume.

01:42.330 --> 01:44.423
Well, you're finally getting
what you wanted, Jackie.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.131
And what is that?

01:46.170 --> 01:47.467
Replacing me.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.266
Oh, Alicia, I am
not replacing you.

01:51.310 --> 01:53.608
You left.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.301
I'm stopping you.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.410
I'm not really sure
how you'll do that.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.372
I'm a lawyer; watch me.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.381
DIANE:
Lindsey...

02:07.420 --> 02:08.648
Megan...

02:08.690 --> 02:10.282
and Pamela.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.922
These three young women

02:11.960 --> 02:14.428
have spent five years
in prison, Your Honor,

02:14.460 --> 02:17.463
five years, for a murder
they did not commit.
Excuse me,

02:17.500 --> 02:19.536
Your Honor,
that is still unproven.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.561
Yes, but what is proven
is that the DNA

02:21.600 --> 02:23.431
tying these girls to
the body was bogus.

02:23.470 --> 02:24.505
Again, Your Honor, an assertion.
Yes,

02:24.540 --> 02:27.338
but it's not looking good
for you, is it, Mr. Agos?

02:27.380 --> 02:28.335
This is the
fifth case

02:28.380 --> 02:30.371
I've had through here
due to the malfeasance

02:30.410 --> 02:33.243
of the Illinois Crime Lab,
and I've overturned all of them.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.181
But those four cases
were built only on DNA.

02:36.220 --> 02:37.710
Here, there was
physical evidence.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.047
The shoe prints
of all three of these women

02:39.090 --> 02:41.752
were found in the vicinity
of the body.
'Cause it was on a trail

02:41.790 --> 02:44.554
that they used every day.
And witnesses at the summer camp

02:44.590 --> 02:48.299
testified to them
repeatedly bullying...

02:48.330 --> 02:50.969
Rosa Torres on the day
of her murder, Your Honor.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.391
It is unfair to discount
the totality of that eVIdence

02:55.440 --> 02:58.466
_ due_to one
Simple Infraction.
"One simple infraction"?

02:58.510 --> 03:00.808
Really? The cornerstone
of your case

03:00.840 --> 03:02.979
was the DNA-- the
Jury was lied to.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.478
Not by the state's
attorney's office.
Which is why

03:05.510 --> 03:08.968
the state's attorney's
office should_sha_re in our
anger at this injustice.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.545
They should be agitating
for the immediate release
of these women,

03:11.590 --> 03:12.852
not fighting against it.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.653
Okay. Thank you, everyone.
You can sit down now.

03:14.690 --> 03:18.888
Given the egregious
nature of these crime
lab infractions,

03:18.930 --> 03:22.661
I have no choice other than
to vacate these convictions.
DIANE: Your Honor, we would

03:22.700 --> 03:23.860
move for an immediate release.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.458
Mr. Agos, do you
intend to proceed

03:25.500 --> 03:26.694
on the original charges?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.628
We do, Your Honor.
And we would oppose bail.

03:28.670 --> 03:30.535
It was denied in
the original trial,

03:30.570 --> 03:33.437
and we see no compelling reason
for it to be granted now.
I would agree.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.402
The defendants are
held for retrial.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.871
What's that _mean?
I stay inSIde?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.411
Just for the moment.
But this was the big one,

03:42.450 --> 03:44.486
getting the
conviction vacated.
I'm gonna cry.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.012
It's good, Lindsey.
I know, it's just, I
don't think they'll let me out.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.278
I have this nightmare
of this open door.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.299
Every time I get close to it,
it shuts in my face.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.399
PETER:
Damn it.
It's okay.

03:54.430 --> 03:57.820
CARY:
Key thing is, we kept
them behind bars.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.963
You know what this is,
don't you?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.468
I'm paying for the sins
of the past.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.705
Crime lab screws up
under Childs...

04:04.740 --> 04:06.605
I have to pay the price.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.471
Do we retry?
They bullied

04:08.510 --> 04:10.774
and killed that girl.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.971
Not only that...

04:13.020 --> 04:15.716
I promised the Torres family
that I wouldn't let the killers

04:15.750 --> 04:17.411
of their daughter go unpunished.

04:17.450 --> 04:19.384
Well... (sighs)

04:19.420 --> 04:21.456
Judge Romano seems
to be leaning against this.

04:21.490 --> 04:25.278
It's crime lab fatigue.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.593
Offer them an Alford plea.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.935
I've got to get this
off our ledger.

04:32.970 --> 04:34.995
(phone rings)
Hello?

04:35.040 --> 04:36.632
Yeah. Hold on. Cary.

04:37.570 --> 04:39.879
Everybody has to sign on though.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.468
If that's what you want.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.876
Hey, Alicia, what's up?

04:43.910 --> 04:45.878
(door closes)
What?

04:45.910 --> 04:48.549
She said she bought the house
for you and the kids.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.309
She said what?

04:50.350 --> 04:52.454
This is the first
I've heard of it.
It's not that

04:52.490 --> 04:53.684
I don't want you
in there, Peter,

04:53.720 --> 04:56.484
it's just weird being separated
and having the kids wanting

04:56.530 --> 04:59.727
to be in the house with you
while I'm on the outs.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.352
Yeah.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.369
But... y-you were thinking
of buying the house, too, right?

05:04.400 --> 05:05.924
Well, yeah, because
of this condo conversion.

05:05.970 --> 05:08.598
Yeah, but then it would've
been you in the house

05:08.640 --> 05:11.063
with the kids
and me on the outs.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.072
Um... you're right.

05:14.110 --> 05:16.499
I-I'm sorry,
we should've talked.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.745
Okay. Well...

05:18.780 --> 05:21.578
Don't worry,
I will speak to Jackie.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.440
Thank you.

05:24.650 --> 05:26.356
(sighs)

05:29.990 --> 05:31.787
MIKE:
Must be odd

05:31.830 --> 05:33.752
working in the same
town as your husband.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.926
Nope, it isn't.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.121
What can I help you with,
Mr. Kresteva?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.967
Mike. Nice kids.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.365
Thanks, Mike.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.436
Eh, it's just,
how do you handle it,

05:42.470 --> 05:43.664
fighting criminal cases

05:43.710 --> 05:45.507
when your husband's
on the other side?

05:45.540 --> 05:48.100
With great delicacy.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.108
I like you, Alicia.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.516
You have wit.
Thank you.

05:52.550 --> 05:56.611
I didn't think it ended so well
the last time we spoke, Mike.

05:56.650 --> 05:59.653
So what is it
that you need?
I thought it ended pretty well.

05:59.690 --> 06:01.681
I never try to
make enemies.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.688
Whenever I disagree
with someone, I think:

06:03.730 --> 06:05.550
today I can't
see their side,

06:05.590 --> 06:06.796
but tomorrow,
who knows?

06:06.830 --> 06:09.048
So y-you see my side?
Well, I've come

06:09.100 --> 06:11.591
to present you with
the report from our
blue ribbon panel.

06:11.630 --> 06:13.769
I recused myself.
Yes, but we've changed

06:13.800 --> 06:16.530
our conclusions--
you convmced us.

06:16.570 --> 06:19.607
We censure _the officers for
not announcmg themselves,

06:19.640 --> 06:23.542
shooting an unarmed
man, and possibly even
placing a drop gun

06:23.580 --> 06:25.445
in his hand to
cover their tracks.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.710
And it also censures my husband
for covering it up?

06:27.750 --> 06:29.172
Well... yes.

06:29.220 --> 06:31.780
Truth is truth, isn't it?

06:31.820 --> 06:34.118
You wouldn't have us
compromise the truth

06:34.160 --> 06:37.129
_ out of some
misplaced deference
to family connections?

06:37.160 --> 06:39.799
No. So then you understand
why I have to recuse myself.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.422
That's why I'm here.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.122
I'm offering you a chance
to write a minority report.

06:44.170 --> 06:47.094
And what would that say?
Whatever you want.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.631
Whatever your conscience
guides you to say.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.864
Mm-hmm.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.969
I think I'll decline.

06:53.010 --> 06:55.774
Mrs. Florrick, I know
you don't trust me,

06:55.810 --> 06:58.199
but I've come_ around
to your Side.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.571
A|| tyranny needs
to gain a foothold

07:00.620 --> 07:03.987
is for people of
good conscience to
remain silent, so...

07:04.020 --> 07:06.557
(knocking)
don't remain silent.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.784
Michael?

07:07.820 --> 07:10.880
Hello. How are you?
I'm good, Diane.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.750
You look great.
You, too.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.950
Now, don't you dare think
about poaching Alicia.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.696
We've got our
hooks into her.
Actually, I was here

07:17.730 --> 07:18.799
to poach you.
Ha!

07:18.830 --> 07:21.060
Alicia just asked
me in to discuss

07:21.100 --> 07:22.601
our blue ribbon panel.
DIANE:
Really?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.039
Well, I hope that
all works out.

07:24.070 --> 07:25.833
I'm sure it will.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.531
Aanay, Alicia, thank you.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.672
It was most helpful.

07:28.710 --> 07:32.043
And thank you, Diane, for
putting Alicia on the panel.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.587
Well... odd that.

07:38.620 --> 07:39.780
Yes.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.811
So, uh, Cary called,
and we have

07:41.860 --> 07:43.555
an Alford plea.

07:43.590 --> 07:44.852
Really?
Yes.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.255
My guess is
they're worried

07:46.290 --> 07:47.655
about a lawsuit.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.827
Lindsey will need
some hand-holding.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.225
We don't want her
to take it?

07:52.270 --> 07:53.931
Oh, no, we just...

07:53.970 --> 07:56.768
want her to know
all the facts.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.630
VANESSA:
So, what do I do?

07:58.670 --> 08:00.228
Don't sleep with
other people.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.168
And that will
get me elected?

08:02.210 --> 08:03.905
I'd vote for you.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.508
Here's how people

08:05.550 --> 08:07.814
will elect you as
Illinois state senator.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.647
You're a woman.
Thank you.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.783
There are three other
men in the race.

08:11.820 --> 08:12.980
They will split
the male vote.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.851
You will win
the female vote,

08:14.890 --> 08:17.927
but... only if you
win the female vote.

08:17.960 --> 08:21.020
Meaning. . .?
Female voters
are traditional.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.665
They don't like
a modern woman.
And that's why you're going

08:23.700 --> 08:26.066
to stand beside me,
stand by your woman?

08:26.100 --> 08:28.660
Vanessa, that is not
what I was saying.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.930
But it's the point,
isn't it?

08:30.970 --> 08:34.531
Having my ex-husband
approving of me

08:34.580 --> 08:36.639
makes me more traditional.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.807
Vanessa.
What?

08:38.850 --> 08:41.273
I'm not saying
we have to mean it.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.311
I'm talking about politics.

08:43.350 --> 08:45.113
Just politics?

08:45.150 --> 08:46.651
Yes.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.681
What else is there?

08:48.720 --> 08:50.722
I don't know.

08:52.760 --> 08:53.988
You tell me.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.862
*

08:58.900 --> 09:00.891
Uh-oh.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.139
A what?

09:04.170 --> 09:05.762
An Alford plea.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.835
It's a form of a...

09:07.880 --> 09:09.074
a guilty plea.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.805
_No.
Wait, just...
just hear us.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.101
I already said...
ALICIA:
Lindsey, listen.

09:12.150 --> 09:14.209
We'll do whatever you want,

09:14.250 --> 09:16.980
but with an Alford plea,
you get out.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.681
You acknowledge
to the prosecution

09:18.720 --> 09:20.358
that they have enough
evidence to convict,

09:20.390 --> 09:21.948
but you get out.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.150
Do they?

09:23.190 --> 09:25.852
Have enough evidence to convict?

09:25.890 --> 09:27.323
Without the DNA,

09:27.360 --> 09:29.794
normally we would say no,
but you never know

09:29.830 --> 09:31.764
for sure what
a jury will do.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.791
So if I take
this... plea...

09:33.840 --> 09:37.037
The state's attorney agrees
to a sentence of time served.

09:37.070 --> 09:39.732
You go free.
Now. Immediately.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.772
Really?
Yeah, Megan, but
there are drawbacks.

09:42.810 --> 09:44.744
You won't be able
to clear your name.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.772
You'll be a convicted felon
for the rest of your life.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.084
And one parole violation,
and you're right back here.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.884
But if I don't take it,
I have to stay here?

09:52.920 --> 09:54.979
Yes. At least until
you get a new trial.

09:55.020 --> 09:56.829
And that's how long?

09:56.860 --> 09:57.884
I don't know.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.354
I want you to have
a complete picture here, Pamela.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.062
The state's attorney
offers this plea

10:04.100 --> 10:06.898
because they're afraid
of being sued.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.864
As part of the plea
agreement, you have
to promise not to sue.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.831
But I get out?

10:10.870 --> 10:12.235
Yes. That's why they do it.

10:12.270 --> 10:14.636
They dangle freedom
in front of your eyes

10:14.680 --> 10:15.908
to get a guilty plea.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.908
And if I turned it down
and sued?

10:17.950 --> 10:20.839
DIANE:
The last crime lab lawsuit
against Cook County

10:20.880 --> 10:23.041
resulted in
a $10 million reward.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.318
$10 million?

10:24.350 --> 10:26.147
That's...
Not a guarantee.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.681
And any award
you would get,
you would have

10:28.720 --> 10:29.880
to split three ways.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.922
Do you think I should
reject this plea?

10:32.960 --> 10:34.996
No. We're just laying
out the options.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.918
We have a very good case

10:36.970 --> 10:38.995
against the state's
attorney's office.

10:39.030 --> 10:43.865
We won a lawsuit last year
on exactly these kind of
crime lab missteps.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.764
And it's important to hold
these people responsible.

10:45.810 --> 10:48.938
But...
We're not the ones
who have to Sit in prison

10:48.980 --> 10:50.004
for another year.

10:51.750 --> 10:55.015
You have no idea what that
kind of money would mean.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.312
My family...

10:56.350 --> 10:58.682
It would change
everything for us.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.883
I guess the question,
then, is...

11:01.920 --> 11:04.923
is it worth it to spend
another year in prison

11:04.960 --> 11:06.325
to maybe change everything?

11:06.360 --> 11:07.952
More or less.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.423
And how long do
I have to decide?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.960
72 hours.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.069
(exhales)

11:15.100 --> 11:17.660
What would you do?

11:20.110 --> 11:22.101
I have no idea.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.971
(door buzzes)

11:24.010 --> 11:25.841
(elevator bell dings)

11:26.920 --> 11:28.774
So, what do you think?

11:28.820 --> 11:30.117
I think she needs the money.

11:30.150 --> 11:31.378
Who doesn't?

11:31.420 --> 11:33.058
(phone vibrates)

11:41.200 --> 11:42.394
(keyboard clicking)

11:42.430 --> 11:43.897
REPORTER:
A recently released report

11:43.930 --> 11:45.864
from an independent
police review authority

11:45.900 --> 11:47.197
has found evidence of a cover-up

11:47.240 --> 11:49.162
meant to protect
a Chicago police officer.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.430
This panel investigated
the controversial shooting

11:51.470 --> 11:52.437
of an unarmed man

11:52.470 --> 11:54.028
on Chicago's El Train.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.001
MIKE:
This report,

11:55.040 --> 11:56.871
exhaustively investigated

11:56.910 --> 11:58.969
by a prestigious
blue ribbon panel

11:59.010 --> 12:00.739
that even included the wife

12:00.780 --> 12:02.042
of the state's attorney himself,

12:02.080 --> 12:06.210
has found a cover-up
by local officials,

12:06.250 --> 12:07.888
including the state's attorney.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.410
REPORTER:
Kresteva also dropped
a bombshell

12:09.460 --> 12:10.324
that should complicate

12:10.360 --> 12:12.419
the ongoing
Illinois political scene.

12:12.460 --> 12:16.226
I am running for governor
of the great state of Illinois.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.889
Together, we need to stop
corruption like this.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.398
We need to stop people
like the state's attorney

12:23.440 --> 12:26.307
from covering up
police shootings like this one.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.978
What's wrong?

12:29.010 --> 12:31.399
Everything.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.924
I was never
the best father or husband

12:47.960 --> 12:50.497
or (chuckles) person, really.

12:50.530 --> 12:53.328
But then something
happened to me.

12:53.370 --> 12:55.338
My son was diagnosed

12:55.370 --> 12:59.568
as having acute
lymphoblastic leukemia,

12:59.610 --> 13:01.430
and I just woke up,

13:01.480 --> 13:03.948
like Paul on the
road to Damascus,

13:03.980 --> 13:07.472
except I was at
a Bears tailgater

13:07.520 --> 13:08.839
stripped down to my underwear.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.086
Damn it. Damn it.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.439
What's wrong?

13:11.490 --> 13:12.514
I just didn't see
something coming.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.188
(sighs)
Have you seen my shoe?

13:14.220 --> 13:15.289
It's on your foot.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.254
Yeah, the other one.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.848
Who's that?

13:18.890 --> 13:19.857
The competition.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.128
My competition?

13:21.160 --> 13:23.094
No, Peter's.
Peter's.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.825
You're thinking about him,

13:24.870 --> 13:25.495
aren't you?

13:25.530 --> 13:27.862
You're in bed with me,

13:27.900 --> 13:28.992
but you're thinking about him.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.009
You're joking, right?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.064
That was a joke?

13:32.110 --> 13:33.134
Come here.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.831
No, I need my shoe.
Eli, come here.

13:35.880 --> 13:36.778
Oh, my God, look at this,
ten messages.

13:36.810 --> 13:37.970
He's been trying to reach me
all morning.

13:38.010 --> 13:38.840
Come over here.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.019
NEWSMAN: You're referring
to Peter Florrick,

13:48.060 --> 13:49.152
the state's attorney?

13:49.190 --> 13:50.953
This was a mistake,
wasn't it?

13:50.990 --> 13:52.423
Yes.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.423
Now go off to your Peter.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.961
Not without my sh...

13:57.000 --> 13:59.423
(giggles)

13:59.470 --> 14:02.394
Our first date.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.533
MIKE:
Now that would be bad enough,

14:04.570 --> 14:06.879
Yeah, this was a mistake.
but then something else
happened.

14:06.910 --> 14:08.502
The wife
of the state's attorney,

14:08.540 --> 14:10.542
Alicia Florrick,
asked me into her office

14:10.580 --> 14:12.639
and told me
ifI changed this report

14:12.680 --> 14:14.545
and exonerated her husband,

14:14.580 --> 14:16.241
that she would sign it, too.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.315
Damn it. Damn it!

14:17.350 --> 14:19.955
So, we only get the Alford
plea if we all agree.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.412
So, where are we?

14:21.460 --> 14:23.587
CALLIE: Pamela wants to
hold out for a civil suit.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.895
Oh, I'm sure she does
after your sales job.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.090
Excuse me, are you accusing me?

14:28.130 --> 14:29.199
It's money to you.

14:29.230 --> 14:31.164
It's a potential
$10 million lawsuit,

14:31.200 --> 14:32.929
and you get 20% of that.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.938
You can't get 20%
of freedom.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.904
Okay, let's keep it civil.
Tommy?

14:36.940 --> 14:38.464
Megan wants to take the plea.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.239
She was beaten up
in prison yesterday.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.929
So, here we go
with the emotional blackmail.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.277
No, it's not blackmail;
I'm just telling you the facts.

14:43.310 --> 14:44.902
She's being targeted
in prison.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.577
And_ this talk of a civil suit's
just making it worse.

14:46.610 --> 14:48.248
What about your client?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.679
Lindsey hasn't
made up her mind yet.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.415
She doesn't want to admit to
something she didn't do.

14:51.450 --> 14:53.088
Exactly.
ALICIA:
But she doesn't want to spend

14:53.120 --> 14:54.917
the rest of her life
in prison, either.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.609
Look, we all know this case
is a slam dunk.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.218
The only reason
the state's attorney

14:58.260 --> 14:59.659
is even offering us
the Alford plea

14:59.690 --> 15:01.658
is because he's on the run.

15:01.700 --> 15:02.655
You're married to him, right?
Tell us.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.327
I can't speak to that.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.621
Well, none of us can.

15:05.670 --> 15:06.728
We all know of cases
which seemed like

15:06.770 --> 15:09.364
slam dunks and turned out
not to be.
Okay, so we have

15:09.400 --> 15:11.664
three days to figure out
whether we have a slam dunk.

15:11.710 --> 15:12.460
I agree.

15:12.510 --> 15:13.329
Our clients are looking

15:13.380 --> 15:14.438
for an assessment
of their chances,

15:14.480 --> 15:18.177
and the prosecution is using
our dissention against us.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.247
So let's use this remaining time
to see what case we have, okay?

15:21.280 --> 15:23.282
You're on it, right?

15:23.320 --> 15:25.618
Yeah, I put a call into
the medical examiner's office.

15:25.650 --> 15:26.787
Oh, and, um,

15:26.820 --> 15:30.028
Kalinda, can I hire you to
look into something for me?

15:30.060 --> 15:31.084
Sure, what is it?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.427
Just a...

15:32.460 --> 15:33.654
I think there might
be something wrong

15:33.700 --> 15:36.225
in a financial arrangement.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.488
Okay, sure, whose?

15:39.700 --> 15:42.066
I will need to know.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.102
My mother-in-law's.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.664
(knocking)

15:46.710 --> 15:48.701
Hey, bum.
Callie.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.970
(giggles)
What are you up to here?

15:51.010 --> 15:52.546
The slumber camp murder?

15:52.580 --> 15:54.445
Yeah, we're trying
to win them some money,

15:54.480 --> 15:55.640
but what happened
to kids today?

15:55.680 --> 15:56.669
They don't want money.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.746
They want freedom.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.758
You look good suspended.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.121
Yep. You got any pointers?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.082
(chuckles)
Don't get rusty.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.428
You've been suspended, what,
six months, right?

16:07.460 --> 16:08.495
Yep.

16:08.530 --> 16:10.395
I was a year.

16:10.430 --> 16:11.590
Addiction. Cocaine use.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.268
I didn't know that.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.632
Yeah,
some of my best summations

16:15.670 --> 16:16.694
were done high.

16:16.740 --> 16:19.265
But don't I seem calmer
these days?

16:19.310 --> 16:21.437
You do.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.038
So, what are you doing?

16:23.080 --> 16:25.469
I'm reading a
book I wrote.

16:25.510 --> 16:26.602
How is it?

16:26.650 --> 16:28.379
Notgood.
Gaughs)

16:29.720 --> 16:32.143
Oh, sorry.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.681
No, it's just one more
thing I know I can't do.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.210
I have something
you might be interested in.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.488
Behind the Bar.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.351
It's a support group
for sanctioned lawyers.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.220
Disbarment, suspension,

16:42.260 --> 16:43.466
drugs...

16:43.500 --> 16:44.489
Sounds exciting.

16:44.530 --> 16:46.498
(laughing) Oh, come on,
what are you doing anyway?

16:46.530 --> 16:48.691
Just lying around all day?

16:48.740 --> 16:51.061
Didn't we almost go out
on a date three years ago?

16:51.110 --> 16:53.476
Yeah, you stood me up.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.569
I was in rehab.

16:55.610 --> 16:58.249
So, we'll make this our date.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.645
Come on.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.773
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

17:01.820 --> 17:03.378
Kalinda, where you been?

17:03.420 --> 17:04.819
Oh, hibernating.

17:04.850 --> 17:07.114
You guys haven't been
too forthcoming lately.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.650
Yeah, well,
that's all changing.

17:08.690 --> 17:09.759
We're all loosening up
around here.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.326
Really? Why's that?

17:11.360 --> 17:14.329
I don't know, but, uh,
your name is no longer dirt.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.055
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:16.100 --> 17:16.828
Into the lab.

17:16.860 --> 17:18.725
No, that way.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.260
What do you need?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.666
Summer camp killing, 2007.

17:22.700 --> 17:23.837
Three girl killers.

17:23.870 --> 17:24.666
Oh, yeah, that one.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.802
I thought that
was getting kicked.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.707
Yeah, state's attorney's office
is considering retrying.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.469
Ah, yes, dead horse
beaten yet again.

17:30.510 --> 17:31.738
Come on.

17:33.150 --> 17:34.469
Uh, 16-year-old girl.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.442
Three other girls brought
her into the woods.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.516
They stabbed her eight times,

17:38.550 --> 17:40.154
(grunts) slashed her carotid.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.511
Weapon was never found.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.380
Ah, ooh, and look at this.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.125
What?

17:46.160 --> 17:48.651
A note for you.

17:49.530 --> 17:51.464
ASA Agos, he's, uh,

17:51.500 --> 17:52.660
one step ahead of you.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.236
Mm, for the moment.

17:57.170 --> 17:59.104
Oh, she was found

17:59.140 --> 18:00.869
without her clothes?
Yeah, they thought
rape at first--

18:00.910 --> 18:02.275
cops always think rape--

18:02.310 --> 18:04.107
but no semen, no penetration,
so they thought

18:04.150 --> 18:06.573
the killer stripped her down
to make it look like a rape.

18:06.610 --> 18:08.817
What's this?

18:08.850 --> 18:10.613
Hypostasis.

18:10.650 --> 18:11.719
Lividity caused

18:11.750 --> 18:12.819
by the blood
settling after death.

18:12.850 --> 18:13.817
No, this.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.384
I don't know.

18:15.420 --> 18:16.614
But no lividity there.

18:16.660 --> 18:17.820
Probably something in contact

18:17.860 --> 18:20.420
with her body,
something on the ground.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.859
No.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.561
It's on the other side
of the ankle, too.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.397
Oh, my God,

18:25.430 --> 18:26.499
you're right.

18:26.530 --> 18:27.758
You solved it.

18:29.470 --> 18:30.801
MIKE:
Alicia Florrick asked me

18:30.840 --> 18:34.139
into her ofﬁce and told me
ifI changed this report

18:34.180 --> 18:36.808
and exonerated her husband
that she would...

18:36.840 --> 18:38.808
It's a lie, Eli;
he's lying.

18:38.850 --> 18:40.249
So, you weren't on this
blue ribbon panel?

18:40.280 --> 18:42.168
No, I was, but I...

18:42.220 --> 18:43.289
So, you didn't meet with him?

18:43.320 --> 18:44.844
I met with him.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.380
I mean, he met with me.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.352
He came here,

18:47.390 --> 18:50.154
but he came here to ask me
if I wanted to write

18:50.190 --> 18:52.181
a minority report,
and I said no.

18:52.230 --> 18:53.925
So, all that stuff about Peter
trying to cover up a shooting,

18:53.960 --> 18:55.325
that's not true?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.863
Unfortunately, I can't

18:57.900 --> 18:59.822
say anything
about those proceedings

18:59.870 --> 19:01.735
because _
they were confidential.

19:01.770 --> 19:03.203
Okay, so that's it.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.663
Wait, Eli, you have
to put out a statement

19:05.710 --> 19:06.904
or something.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.532
Saying what?
Saying that it's not true.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.401
I-I didn't ask him
to stop the report.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.576
Why would we do that?

19:12.610 --> 19:14.168
Because he's lying, Eli.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.575
(chuckles)
Alicia,

19:16.620 --> 19:19.180
people lie,
and politicians

19:19.220 --> 19:20.858
are just people.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.552
The problem is when you run
around putting out statements

19:23.590 --> 19:25.421
saying that people
lied, it just brings

19:25.460 --> 19:27.223
more attention to the lie.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.488
People think there's
something wrong with you

19:28.530 --> 19:29.895
for making such a fuss about it.

19:29.930 --> 19:30.862
People think you lied

19:30.900 --> 19:32.765
because you're making
a fuss about a lie.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.939
That's crazy.
It's a 24-hour news story.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.392
It'll go away

19:36.440 --> 19:37.930
unless we take the bait.
But it's...

19:37.970 --> 19:41.906
It makes me look bad,
and-and he gets away with it?

19:41.940 --> 19:42.907
Yep.

19:42.940 --> 19:44.407
You have to let
it go, AliCia.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.543
It's the big leagues.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.411
You file a few off.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.233
KALINDA:
It's a bicycle clip.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.670
You wear it on your
ankle to keep your pants

20:13.710 --> 20:15.439
from getting caught
in the bike chain.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.505
Which one is this for,
my mother-in-law?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.506
(chuckles)
The victim's body.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.370
Something was pressed
against her ankles

20:21.420 --> 20:22.944
when she was murdered.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.914
Here and here; that's why
there was no lividity.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.417
But there's nothing
in the police report

20:26.450 --> 20:27.986
that says she was riding
a bike that night.

20:28.020 --> 20:28.987
I know.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.954
And yet...

20:30.990 --> 20:34.357
So, where was she riding it?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.361
A bicycle?

20:40.400 --> 20:42.368
There was a chance that Rosa

20:42.400 --> 20:43.708
rode a bicycle that night
just before she was killed.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.264
But she didn't
have a bike.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.608
I mean, we weren't allowed
to bring anything.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.608
They didn't want
any of us off grounds.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.301
What about the counselors?

20:51.350 --> 20:53.318
Mary Jane had a bike.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.977
The counselor in Rosa's cabin,
she had a mountain bike.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.772
She was always
going off riding.

20:56.820 --> 20:57.889
Good, thanks.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.046
That's helpful.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.284
Wait.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.753
What about the plea?

21:01.790 --> 21:02.984
What are Pamela and Megan

21:03.020 --> 21:05.352
gonna do?
Oh, yes.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.893
Pamela doesn't want
to take the Alford plea,

21:07.930 --> 21:09.022
but Megan does.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.392
Megan's being beaten up
in prison.

21:11.430 --> 21:12.624
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.729
Maybe I should
take the plea.

21:14.770 --> 21:15.964
Here's what we're trying
to do, Lindsey.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.709
We want to line up the evidence
to demonstrate to Judge Romano

21:19.740 --> 21:20.934
that the state's attorney

21:20.980 --> 21:23.847
has no evidence
to hold you to trial.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.007
They're merely trying
to neutralize a civil suit.

21:26.050 --> 21:28.018
If we're successful,

21:28.050 --> 21:29.608
you won't have to plead guilty.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.083
You'll just be released.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.782
But you have to do that
before the plea expires?

21:33.820 --> 21:36.709
Yes, that's why
we're pursuing this evidence.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.025
Okay, and you want me
to sit tight?

21:40.060 --> 21:41.857
Yes, just for a little
while longer.

21:41.900 --> 21:42.958
Then I will.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.358
Tell Megan to stay strong.

21:49.900 --> 21:50.901
Thank you,

21:50.940 --> 21:52.032
Alicia.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.935
(door buzzes)

21:53.980 --> 21:55.333
You still having nightmares?

21:55.380 --> 21:56.870
No.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.775
KALINDA:
So, we have evidence that

22:02.820 --> 22:05.539
the victim, Rosa Torres,
might have ridden a bike

22:05.590 --> 22:07.353
the night she was killed.

22:07.390 --> 22:09.654
I understand that, uh,
you had a bike, right?

22:09.690 --> 22:11.658
Yeah. Why?

22:11.690 --> 22:13.123
And you reported it stolen?

22:13.160 --> 22:15.025
But then you found it, right?

22:15.060 --> 22:18.359
Yeah, a week later. Why?

22:18.400 --> 22:21.039
Uh, Rosa borrowed it that night,
intending to return it,

22:21.070 --> 22:22.389
but then, she was murdered.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.805
How do you know all this?

22:23.840 --> 22:26.001
Where did you find it?
What does it matter?

22:26.040 --> 22:28.406
Well, it matters, because
Lindsey is innocent,

22:28.440 --> 22:30.806
and my guess is, Rosa borrowed
your bike that night

22:30.850 --> 22:32.169
to meet someone
off the grounds,

22:32.210 --> 22:36.647
and he or she moved her body
back onto the grounds,

22:36.680 --> 22:38.409
but never knew about the bike.

22:38.450 --> 22:39.849
So, where'd you find it?

22:39.890 --> 22:42.484
MIKE: _
I want complete separation

22:42.520 --> 22:46.854
between the legal
and the political.

22:46.890 --> 22:49.097
Anyway, I think
you all get it,

22:49.130 --> 22:51.098
and with that,
I need a moment.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.929
Alicia, good
to see you.

22:54.970 --> 22:56.437
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything

22:56.470 --> 22:57.869
about my press
conference yesterday.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.937
I didn't want to let my campaign
get in the way of the panel.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.107
So, I invited you
to my office?

23:04.150 --> 23:05.674
You...

23:05.710 --> 23:07.644
Excuse me?
You said,
I invited you

23:07.680 --> 23:10.478
to my office, and tried
to get you to change the report

23:10.520 --> 23:12.579
about Peter?
Yes.

23:12.620 --> 23:13.780
Which is a lie.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.151
Which part?

23:15.190 --> 23:17.454
All of it.

23:17.490 --> 23:20.948
First of all,
do you want some water,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.092
or something
to drink?
No.

23:22.130 --> 23:23.495
And second of all,

23:23.530 --> 23:24.861
I'm not... I'm not sure

23:24.900 --> 23:26.424
what you're disagreeing about.

23:26.470 --> 23:27.459
I'm not disagreeing
about anything.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.637
I'm telling you to stop

23:28.670 --> 23:29.796
lying about me.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.432
Alicia, I'm not lying
about anything.

23:31.470 --> 23:32.698
You invited me into your office.

23:32.740 --> 23:35.709
No, I didn't.

23:35.740 --> 23:38.049
You came to my office.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.604
Because you invited me.

23:39.650 --> 23:43.108
And then you asked me
to change the report.

23:43.150 --> 23:45.482
No. Y came to my office,

23:47.150 --> 23:49.186
_ if I wanted
to write a minority report.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.756
Alicia, uh... (laughs)

23:50.790 --> 23:52.724
I'm sorry. I...

23:52.760 --> 23:54.227
Our memories seem
to diverge here.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.899
You invited me into your office,
and I was stunned

23:56.930 --> 23:58.898
when you asked me
to change the report.

23:58.930 --> 24:01.137
I asked you if this was
covered by confidentiality.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.797
You said, "No."

24:02.840 --> 24:04.569
Otherwise, I never
would have mentioned it

24:04.610 --> 24:06.760
in my press conference.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.138
What are you talking about?

24:10.180 --> 24:12.239
You're lying!
No.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.214
I'm not.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.514
How can you pretend
that isn't what happened?

24:16.550 --> 24:17.539
One second,

24:17.590 --> 24:20.081
Ginger. I'll
be right out.

24:27.290 --> 24:29.656
You're gonna lose.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.224
I am? To whom?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.226
Peter.
No.

24:33.270 --> 24:34.999
You know why I won't?

24:35.040 --> 24:37.099
Because he isn't gonna
enter the race.

24:37.140 --> 24:39.233
He's too smart. He
knows he's vulnerable.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.932
Stop... lying about me.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.175
Alicia... (scoffs)

24:44.210 --> 24:46.906
Don't pretend what I'm saying
isn't the truth.

24:46.950 --> 24:49.976
I know a lie can travel
halfway around the world

24:50.020 --> 24:52.113
_ while the truth
is putting its shoes on.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.152
But still...

25:00.730 --> 25:03.699
MARY JANE:
I found it here,

25:03.730 --> 25:06.528
a week later just leaning
there against a tree.

25:06.570 --> 25:07.662
Chain broken.

25:11.270 --> 25:13.773
Who lives here?

25:13.810 --> 25:15.107
Some people who
work in town.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.938
And counselors?

25:17.980 --> 25:19.538
A few.
(knocking)

25:19.580 --> 25:21.172
Hi. I'm so sorry to bother you.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.812
I was thinking
of sending my daughter

25:22.850 --> 25:24.283
to the summer camp up the road.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.878
Do you think it's a good...?

25:25.920 --> 25:27.046
(knocking)

25:27.090 --> 25:28.079
Hi. Uh, my name is Kalinda,

25:28.120 --> 25:30.156
and I was thinking
of working as a counselor...

25:32.330 --> 25:35.299
and working as an investigator
for a reality TV show,

25:35.330 --> 25:37.298
looking
into the slumber camp murder.

25:37.330 --> 25:40.128
Really? I worked
at the camp then.

25:40.170 --> 25:41.068
Really?

25:41.100 --> 25:42.636
Yeah, Rosa was a great girl.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.831
That was a tragedy,
what happened.

25:44.870 --> 25:47.009
Yeah. Must have been tough.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.099
Were you guys close?

25:49.140 --> 25:50.300
Thanks.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.275
No, just, um...
just the usual

25:53.310 --> 25:54.777
instructor-camper
relationship.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.845
You ran a photography program?

25:56.880 --> 25:58.347
Yeah.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.585
I also taught at the
community college

26:00.620 --> 26:02.588
before everything
went digital.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.224
There was an
art form to film.

26:04.260 --> 26:06.888
Now everybody just worries
about computer bytes.

26:06.930 --> 26:10.252
Nobody cares about
process anymore.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.097
I loved working at
that camp, though.

26:12.130 --> 26:13.734
Those kids inspire me.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.635
In-in what way?

26:15.670 --> 26:18.662
Mm, their reverence
for nature.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.302
There's not a lot of
reverence anymore.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.331
There she is.

26:24.310 --> 26:26.346
There's Rosa.

26:26.380 --> 26:29.247
Nice girl.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.284
(laughs quietly)

26:32.320 --> 26:35.209
ELI:
I don't know.
He hasn't decided yet.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.784
Well, which way
is he leaning?

26:36.820 --> 26:38.629
Well, to be honest,
Peter is leaning

26:38.660 --> 26:39.649
against running
for governor.

26:39.690 --> 26:40.827
Why?

26:40.860 --> 26:43.192
He feels the Democratic
Committee is yanking him around.

26:43.230 --> 26:46.620
They promise him a speech at
convention, then they back down.

26:46.670 --> 26:48.262
It doesn't help that
Kresteva has declared.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.631
He's pretty
popular, you know.

26:49.670 --> 26:51.069
I spoke to him.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.874
You... When?

26:53.910 --> 26:55.935
Today.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.948
You spoke to him
about lying.

26:57.980 --> 26:59.709
Didn't you?

26:59.750 --> 27:02.844
You couldn't help yourself.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.984
And he said,
he wasn't lying, but

27:05.020 --> 27:06.385
you misremembered, right?

27:06.420 --> 27:07.387
Yes.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.389
Alicia, I am good at my job.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.079
I know what people do.

27:13.130 --> 27:15.394
So when I say,
don't speak to them again,

27:15.430 --> 27:17.694
please believe me,
I know what

27:17.730 --> 27:19.721
I speak of.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.658
Peter should run.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.401
I know.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.635
He needs your help.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.974
Kresteva is dangerous.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.419
He's like Blagojevich dangerous.

27:35.450 --> 27:36.940
Stop selling, Eli.

27:36.980 --> 27:38.641
Quit while you're ahead.
Okay.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.716
I'm ahead?

27:42.760 --> 27:45.388
You tell me what you need,
and I will think about it.

27:45.430 --> 27:46.351
No kids.

27:46.390 --> 27:48.051
I know.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.391
And there it is.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.906
You didn't have to
say that, AliCia.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.101
I know.

28:01.140 --> 28:03.131
(heavy sigh)

28:03.180 --> 28:04.875
_I'm not sure
if I'm running.

28:04.910 --> 28:06.275
Yes.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.119
That's what Eli said.

28:08.150 --> 28:10.015
Hmm.

28:10.050 --> 28:12.746
Well, Kresteva's
no worse than most.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.815
Mm.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.749
I'm not sure I agree,
but either way,

28:17.790 --> 28:19.758
this isn't about him.

28:19.790 --> 28:22.998
It's about you wanting
to see me elected?

28:24.900 --> 28:27.164
Peter, we have had our...

28:27.200 --> 28:29.839
issues,
but I've always respected

28:29.870 --> 28:31.963
your political abilities.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.934
And I've always thought you were
better in office than...

28:34.980 --> 28:37.073
the alternative.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.345
You know, to be honest, Alicia,

28:41.380 --> 28:44.087
I'm finally enjoying
what I'm doing here.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.985
Maybe that's why I'm thinking
of not running.

28:48.020 --> 28:51.023
Okay... if that's the reason.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.992
Hey.

28:55.030 --> 28:58.488
Your support
means a lot to me.

28:58.530 --> 29:01.465
Run, Peter.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.491
You'd be a good governor.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.508
MAN:
That's when I found out

29:10.540 --> 29:12.849
I was disbarred.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.348
(crying)

29:15.380 --> 29:18.918
I've worked... I worked
my life to become a lavwer.

29:18.950 --> 29:20.508
It was everything to me.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.780
(sobbing)

29:22.820 --> 29:24.526
This was fun.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.959
(laughs)

29:25.990 --> 29:27.526
There are usually more people.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.448
Yup, that's all
this needs.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.195
You know, one of the dangers

29:31.230 --> 29:33.562
of not having the law
to fall back on?

29:33.600 --> 29:34.567
Coming here with you?

29:34.600 --> 29:36.465
Distractions.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.434
Drugs, alcohol, gambling.

29:38.470 --> 29:40.438
Anonymous sex with strangers.

29:40.470 --> 29:44.042
It's a good thing
we're not strangers.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.275
I could pretend
to be a stranger.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.983
(rifling through papers)

29:51.020 --> 29:53.113
My apartment
is ten minutes from here.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.158
I'll leave first.

29:56.190 --> 29:58.055
If we left,

29:58.090 --> 30:00.081
he'd be alone.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.151
My address.

30:16.910 --> 30:18.878
PETER:
Mom, how are you?

30:18.910 --> 30:20.002
Good.

30:20.050 --> 30:22.848
Oh, I love
seeing you here.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.882
Seems so... appropriate.

30:26.190 --> 30:28.454
(sighs)

30:28.490 --> 30:30.458
Don't buy the
house, Mom.

30:30.490 --> 30:32.549
Oh, she talked to you?

30:32.590 --> 30:33.921
(sighs)

30:33.960 --> 30:35.222
Yes, Alicia
talked to me.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.488
She doesn't understand.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.623
She thinks I'm doing this
to hurt her.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.138
I'm doing this for you

30:41.170 --> 30:42.296
and the kids.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.568
I know, and thank you.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.862
Now, don't buy the house.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.332
You know, she wants to buy it.

30:46.370 --> 30:47.598
She wants to live there
Without you.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.631
Mom, it's not
your house.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.274
I put a down payment on it.

30:52.310 --> 30:53.914
I'll lose that.

30:53.950 --> 30:55.872
No, you'll lose
the earnest money at the most.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.012
I can't afford losing that.

30:57.050 --> 30:58.915
Yes, you can.
You'll be fine.

30:58.950 --> 31:01.510
Peter, I love you.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.085
You have a good heart, but

31:04.130 --> 31:06.655
you don't know when people
are manipulating you. I do.

31:06.690 --> 31:09.921
Alicia is manipulating you.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.622
Alicia and I are trying
very hard to act like adults.

31:12.670 --> 31:15.935
I need you to butt out.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.164
(laughs)

31:19.210 --> 31:21.269
Peter, H can't believe it.

31:21.310 --> 31:22.436
No, listen to me.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.471
_Sit down.
Listen to me.

31:25.650 --> 31:29.245
Do not buy that house.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.089
Do you understand me?

31:31.120 --> 31:35.159
Peter, she's controlling you.
Mother!

31:35.190 --> 31:37.920
Do you want me
in your life?

31:37.960 --> 31:39.655
Yes or no?

31:39.690 --> 31:41.089
Yes.

31:41.130 --> 31:42.427
Then stop it.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.462
Stop it right now!

31:45.500 --> 31:48.663
Call the seller _
tomorrow, or I Will.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.668
Do you understand me?

31:55.410 --> 31:57.401
Mm.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.968
Good.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.011
Thanks for coming in.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.411
You think he was having
a sexual relationship with her?

32:10.460 --> 32:11.586
I checked his record.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.121
Two years after the murder,
another camper accused him

32:14.160 --> 32:15.491
of sexual harassment.

32:15.530 --> 32:18.021
So you're saying, Rosa
took Mary Jane's bike

32:18.070 --> 32:19.560
and rode it to this
counselor's house?

32:19.600 --> 32:21.488
Yeah. Justin Varney,
but no one ever knew,

32:21.540 --> 32:24.338
because the body was found in
the woods back near her cabin.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.167
The killer must have
dumped it there.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.529
Why would he kill her?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.333
Accusations of criminal
sexualabuse.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.041
She was 16, he was 25.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.048
So, call an emergency hearing,
ask for

32:33.080 --> 32:35.275
a reconsideration
on bail.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.719
(sighs)

32:36.750 --> 32:38.615
It's worth a shot.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.140
Okay.

32:40.190 --> 32:41.259
I'll prepare
the motion.
Mm.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.078
You take it head-on.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.358
We had problems
in our marriage,

32:45.390 --> 32:47.051
but we've worked hard
to mend fences.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.024
Mend fences?

32:49.060 --> 32:51.028
Do you have a better clich?

32:51.070 --> 32:52.662
Just a second.

32:53.700 --> 32:56.089
Hey, Frank.
What's up?

32:56.140 --> 32:58.028
You tell me.

32:58.070 --> 33:00.129
You saw Mike Kresteva
announce for governor.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.239
I did.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.077
Is Peter running
against him?

33:03.110 --> 33:04.646
Is the Democratic Committee
supporting him?

33:04.680 --> 33:06.079
You come out for Peter,

33:06.110 --> 33:07.304
he'll run.

33:07.350 --> 33:09.511
Is that your ex-wife?

33:14.120 --> 33:16.179
Yes. Vanessa.

33:16.220 --> 33:18.279
And she's running
for state senate?

33:18.330 --> 33:20.628
Yes.
And you're running
her campaign?

33:20.660 --> 33:22.355
Consulting.
I can do both

33:22.400 --> 33:24.095
at the same time;
don't worry.

33:24.130 --> 33:26.098
And what if you can't?

33:28.700 --> 33:30.065
What's up, Frank?

33:30.100 --> 33:31.328
We don't want her to run.

33:31.370 --> 33:33.338
What about Robert Mulvey
for state senator?

33:35.210 --> 33:37.178
Don't do this to me, please.

33:37.210 --> 33:39.303
She jumped the line, Eli.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.818
We don't want a
woman in the race.

33:41.850 --> 33:43.818
Mulvey wins the women's
vote without her...

33:43.850 --> 33:45.408
Then let Mulvey compete.
No.

33:45.450 --> 33:47.111
That's not how
this works.

33:47.150 --> 33:50.711
He loses the women's
vote, he loses.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.387
You want us to help Peter,

33:52.430 --> 33:55.058
you drop out of your
ex-wife's campaign.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.226
This is crazy.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.818
No, it's not.
I can't do that to her.

33:57.860 --> 33:59.396
Yes, you can.

33:59.430 --> 34:01.694
She can run in four
years; help her then.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.267
(quietly):
Damn it!

34:05.310 --> 34:08.234
Uh... don't go getting
melodramatic on me, Eli.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.770
You don't care

34:09.810 --> 34:12.108
about the state race.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.641
Peter's the ball game.

34:14.680 --> 34:18.480
Just tell her you can't
help with her campaign.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.681
Good to see
you, Eli.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.075
(exhales)

35:05.300 --> 35:07.120
JUDGE:
And what do we have today,

35:07.170 --> 35:08.489
Counselors?
DIANE:
We're here because,

35:08.540 --> 35:11.509
Your Honor, my client
and her codefendants

35:11.540 --> 35:14.373
don't have the luxury
of waiting for a trial.

35:14.410 --> 35:16.332
Hey, Justin Varney
has an alibi.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.245
He was at a bar
with some friends

35:18.280 --> 35:21.613
at the time
of the murder.

35:21.650 --> 35:23.413
ALICIA:
The timeline could be off?

35:23.450 --> 35:24.587
Yeah, but there's

35:24.620 --> 35:25.644
something else.

35:25.690 --> 35:28.409
That's a friendship bracelet,
the kind teenage girls

35:28.460 --> 35:30.815
give to their boyfriends
and keep one for themselves.

35:30.860 --> 35:32.555
And that is Megan.

35:32.590 --> 35:35.423
Megan gave Justin her
friendship bracelet.

35:35.460 --> 35:36.495
Justin didn't do it.

35:36.530 --> 35:38.327
He was dating girls
from the camp,

35:38.370 --> 35:40.759
but he wasn't at home
the night of the murder.

35:40.800 --> 35:41.892
Rosa went there
to see him, and...

35:41.940 --> 35:44.329
Megan was jealous.
Yeah, and Megan laid
in wait for her.

35:44.370 --> 35:45.667
Is Cary anywhere near this?

35:45.710 --> 35:47.302
Not yet, but I
wouldn't chance it.

35:47.340 --> 35:48.307
And our client?
I don't know,

35:48.340 --> 35:50.638
I think the only one
involved is Megan, but...

35:50.680 --> 35:51.840
Their fates are tied.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.417
Uh, okay, go show it to Diane.

35:54.450 --> 35:57.419
And thanks for the help
with my mother-in-law.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.179
(clears throat)

35:59.220 --> 36:01.882
Yes, Jackie.
The money for the down payment,

36:01.920 --> 36:04.320
you borrowed it
from Zach and Grace's trust,

36:04.360 --> 36:05.884
and that is...

36:05.930 --> 36:07.329
What?

36:07.360 --> 36:09.419
I had a stroke.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.588
You... Oh, come on, Jackie.

36:12.630 --> 36:16.259
Alicia, I can't reach Peter.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.337
Please, you need to call him.

36:19.370 --> 36:22.305
I'm in the hospital.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.170
(beep)

36:34.720 --> 36:35.948
And here we are.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.787
Yep, here we are.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.186
Have you decided?

36:42.300 --> 36:43.892
No private lives.

36:43.930 --> 36:46.592
Ah. Mafia rules?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.992
We can come after
each other but
not the families.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.632
Nope.

36:52.670 --> 36:55.434
Peter, sorry, my one
play here is...

36:55.480 --> 36:57.778
Sorry, guys,
can you grab the next one?

36:57.810 --> 36:59.641
Thanks.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.979
My one play here is to
keep you out of the race.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.682
And how do you keep an
ambitious man from running?

37:06.720 --> 37:08.711
Tell him you'll
go after his family

37:08.760 --> 37:10.648
with everything you got.

37:11.860 --> 37:14.351
You're a real piece
of work, aren't you?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.719
I try to be.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.729
(laughs) Well, I'm
gonna come after you

37:18.770 --> 37:20.397
with everything I've got,

37:20.430 --> 37:22.398
everything I can find.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.533
Sure.

37:24.570 --> 37:25.730
Why not.

37:26.910 --> 37:30.801
Peter, you enter the race,
I can promise you one thing:

37:30.840 --> 37:34.412
you may not regret it,
but your wife will.

37:34.450 --> 37:37.544
Oh, and...
your phone's ringing.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.285
(phone vibrating)

37:42.460 --> 37:44.052
Hi, Alicia.

37:44.090 --> 37:45.728
What?

38:10.580 --> 38:12.741
I forgive you.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.551
Is she all right?

38:17.820 --> 38:20.789
I don't know.

38:20.830 --> 38:23.822
Mom, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry I
yelled at you.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.792
It's gonna
be all right.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.811
I'm sorry.
Really?

38:43.850 --> 38:45.989
I thought I could handle
two campaigns at once,

38:46.020 --> 38:47.612
but I just don't
have the bandwidth

38:47.650 --> 38:49.789
to do either well.
So you chose him.

38:49.820 --> 38:53.028
I chose the campaign I was
managing, not consulting.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.722
I'm sorry.

38:58.630 --> 39:02.088
This is because we slept
together, isn't it?

39:02.140 --> 39:03.937
No.

39:03.970 --> 39:07.064
I don't believe you.
Look, Vanessa, it
pains me to do this.

39:07.110 --> 39:10.079
Well, I'm so sorry
for yo pain!

39:11.880 --> 39:13.575
Look, I just...
What?

39:13.610 --> 39:16.909
I just hope that we can
still be friends, because...

39:16.950 --> 39:19.145
this has been nice.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.919
(groans)

39:20.950 --> 39:23.657
Good-bye, Eli.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.958
CARY:
Okay, run this by me again.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.550
Hypothetically...
Of course.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.965
if I_ could
convmce you

39:32.000 --> 39:34.969
that one of the codefendants
was actually guilty but

39:35.000 --> 39:36.035
the other
two weren't...
That's a big if.

39:36.070 --> 39:38.402
would you drop the charges
against the other two?

39:39.610 --> 39:40.736
(sighs)

39:40.770 --> 39:42.579
Alicia, it's not
my call to make.

39:42.610 --> 39:44.032
I still have a job
to protect here.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.843
For the time being,
at least.

39:45.880 --> 39:49.475
But I thought you liked the--
what did you call it?

39:49.520 --> 39:50.748
Clarity.

39:50.780 --> 39:53.544
(chuckles)
Well, let's just say

39:53.590 --> 39:55.114
it's getting murkier
by the day.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.526
I'm sorry, Alicia,
honestly.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.468
You don't seem
happy here, Cary.
Really?

40:07.500 --> 40:08.831
Here in my cubicle?

40:08.870 --> 40:11.031
Got my Family Circus
cartoons and my ficus.

40:11.070 --> 40:13.538
What more could I want?

40:13.570 --> 40:16.038
I'll talk to you.
Yeah.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.099
Peter, it's time to do this.

40:20.150 --> 40:22.618
It's time to decide.

40:22.650 --> 40:25.983
Yeah, I know.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.215
Which way are you going?

40:28.250 --> 40:29.888
Let's do it.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.182
Good.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.754
We'll win this.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.121
I don't know about that, but...

40:37.160 --> 40:39.128
it's been decided.

40:40.170 --> 40:42.195
(beep)

40:44.570 --> 40:46.208
(sighs)

40:51.550 --> 40:53.643
No.
Callie,

40:53.680 --> 40:55.739
all our clients are
gonna Sit in jail

40:55.780 --> 40:58.715
for another year,
while the state's
attorney's office

40:58.750 --> 41:00.183
devotes every
resource they have

41:00.220 --> 41:02.586
to figuring out how
to prove them guilty.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.759
Do you really think
they're not gonna find this?
It's not about

41:04.790 --> 41:06.724
what I think, Diane-- my
client has made up her mind.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.227
Then your client needS
to be told the facts.

41:08.260 --> 41:11.593
This evidence against
Megan looks equally
bad for all of us.

41:11.630 --> 41:12.824
There's no way
to prove that Lindsey

41:12.870 --> 41:14.064
and Pam didn't
help Megan do this.

41:14.100 --> 41:14.930
We'll take our chances.

41:14.970 --> 41:17.234
No. You want the money
from a lawsuit--

41:17.270 --> 41:19.261
that'S why you'll
take your chances.
Oh, grow up.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.232
Don't play the
martyr here.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.932
You were just aS much
into the money aS I waS.

41:25.310 --> 41:29.144
And what if... Lindsey
testifies against your client?

41:29.180 --> 41:29.919
What?

41:29.950 --> 41:31.269
It's a new trial.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.912
Cary needs new
witnesses

41:32.950 --> 41:34.247
to replace the DNA evidence.

41:34.290 --> 41:36.258
Lindsey would make
a good witness.

41:36.290 --> 41:40.954
She'd lie?
She wants out of prisons;
she's desperate.

41:40.990 --> 41:43.094
You never know what
a desperate person Will say.

41:43.130 --> 41:45.963
So I'm wrong to want money,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.127
but you are not wrong
to blackmail?

41:48.170 --> 41:50.161
That's right.

41:58.110 --> 42:00.146
How'S that door looking?

42:00.180 --> 42:00.999
Within reach.

42:01.050 --> 42:03.245
You have any idea
what you're gonna do?

42:04.280 --> 42:05.747
No.

42:05.790 --> 42:07.883
I used to like volleyball.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.514
I wouldn't mind playing
some volleyball.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.055
This is where

42:13.090 --> 42:15.194
(door buzzeS, unlocks)
the nightmare always ended.

42:15.230 --> 42:17.255
(metal creaks)

42:19.800 --> 42:21.097
WOMAN:
Lindsey.

42:21.130 --> 42:23.234
(Lindsey laughs, gasps)
Oh, my baby!

42:23.270 --> 42:26.103
It's over.
Oh, sweetheart!

42:26.140 --> 42:29.268
PETER:
We've had it for far too long
in the state of Illinois.

42:29.310 --> 42:34.270
It's the politics
of divisiveness and discord,

42:34.310 --> 42:38.246
personal attacks
instead of public achievement,

42:38.280 --> 42:42.580
negative campaigning
instead of positive creation.

42:42.620 --> 42:44.850
And that is why today

42:44.890 --> 42:47.188
I am throwing my cap
into the race

42:47.230 --> 42:50.051
and announcing my candidacy
for the governor of Illinois.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.295
(whooping, clapping)

42:52.330 --> 42:55.094
MAN:
Our next governor!

42:55.140 --> 42:58.098
(clapping, indistinct Shouts)
