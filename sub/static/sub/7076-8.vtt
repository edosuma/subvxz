00:01.538 --> 00:03.120
Why did I come to Greendale?

00:03.360 --> 00:07.163
So I can keep my job
and get busy with my education.

00:08.561 --> 00:10.066
To meet different people.

00:10.100 --> 00:14.670
Because Greendale's
a slam dunk.

00:14.705 --> 00:16.038
- So why should you--
- Why should you--

00:16.073 --> 00:17.406
Why should you go Greendale?

00:17.441 --> 00:18.841
That's easy.

00:18.876 --> 00:21.010
Greendale has
the most advanced typing class

00:21.044 --> 00:22.578
in the southwestern
Greendale area.

00:22.613 --> 00:24.714
And now you can register
by fax.

00:24.748 --> 00:27.183
Go Greendale,
go Greendale, go!

00:27.217 --> 00:29.519
That, as you probably know,

00:29.553 --> 00:31.571
is the currently-running
commercial for our school.

00:31.605 --> 00:33.656
Yeah, I always see it
during late-night marathons

00:33.690 --> 00:34.690
of <i>Fantasy Island.</i>

00:34.724 --> 00:36.025
That's not an accident.

00:36.059 --> 00:38.027
It's the result
of intensive targeting.

00:38.061 --> 00:40.246
But now,
Greendale's School board

00:40.280 --> 00:44.733
has given me a budget of
$2,000 to update our little ad.

00:44.751 --> 00:46.285
Are you sure it should change?

00:46.336 --> 00:47.736
I chose Greendale
over city college

00:47.754 --> 00:49.505
because of the way
that one dude goes...

00:50.043 --> 00:51.693
Ah, okay, okay.

00:51.701 --> 00:54.053
You know I love to be seen
agreeing with you, Troy.

00:55.062 --> 00:56.745
But this is our chance to make

00:56.763 --> 00:59.148
Greendale's most reasonable
dreams come true.

00:59.183 --> 01:01.300
And I need your help--
All of you.

01:01.351 --> 01:03.636
That's okay, Jeffrey.

01:03.687 --> 01:04.953
You can say no.

01:04.988 --> 01:07.206
This school asks
very little of its students.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.558
It mainly gives.

01:08.592 --> 01:11.694
I feel like you guys might know
what I'm talking about.

01:12.996 --> 01:14.997
How can we help?

01:15.032 --> 01:16.616
Oh, thanks for asking.

01:16.650 --> 01:19.318
I've chosen you,
Greendale's brightest,

01:19.369 --> 01:21.454
most coincidentally diverse,
hispanics not withstanding,

01:21.488 --> 01:24.507
study group to star
in our commercial.

01:24.541 --> 01:26.042
- Ooh.
- Pick a character.

01:26.076 --> 01:27.543
We start this weekend.

01:27.578 --> 01:29.011
Oh, we get to be on tv!

01:29.046 --> 01:30.279
But if we're shooting
this weekend,

01:30.297 --> 01:31.664
why are these cameras here?

01:31.715 --> 01:34.834
Abed, true to form, has
decided to do the weird thing

01:34.885 --> 01:37.637
and film a documentary
instead of helping.

01:37.671 --> 01:39.121
As a student of character,
I have a feeling

01:39.156 --> 01:40.122
that trying to make
this commercial

01:40.157 --> 01:41.691
may cost the dean his sanity.

01:41.725 --> 01:44.060
And my camera follows
the fire, not the smoke.

01:44.094 --> 01:45.261
Ever seen <i>Hearts of Darkness?</i>

01:45.295 --> 01:46.729
Way better than <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

01:46.763 --> 01:48.931
What's the catering sitch
going to be on this picture?

01:48.966 --> 01:50.032
This isn't Hollywood, Pierce.

01:50.067 --> 01:52.101
If it was, these glasses
would be tinted,

01:52.135 --> 01:53.135
and I'd be friends
with Stevie Nicks.

01:53.153 --> 01:54.520
No catering.

01:54.571 --> 01:55.905
This is outrageous.

01:55.939 --> 01:57.323
I'm not leaving my trailer
till there's food.

01:57.357 --> 01:58.908
You don't have a trailer.

01:58.942 --> 02:00.526
Well, then,
I'll rent a trailer.

02:00.577 --> 02:02.979
And I won't leave it till
I have the one I don't have.

02:03.013 --> 02:04.280
I'm an actor,
not a circus freak.

02:04.314 --> 02:05.748
Oh, no.

02:05.782 --> 02:07.833
I needed to go that way.

02:07.868 --> 02:09.985
Eh, I'll loop around.

02:10.020 --> 02:13.856
♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪

02:13.891 --> 02:16.926
♪ give me the hope

02:16.960 --> 02:20.062

02:36.847 --> 02:40.182
All right, let's rehearse
this mamajama.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.535
Does everyone know
who they are?

02:42.569 --> 02:43.920
Where's my script girl?

02:43.954 --> 02:45.371
It's supervisor,
and I'm right behind you.

02:45.405 --> 02:47.540
Thank you, supervisor girl.

02:47.574 --> 02:49.375
Faster than a locomotive.

02:49.409 --> 02:51.077
A script supervisor
is the person

02:51.128 --> 02:52.695
that tells everyone
to stay on script

02:52.713 --> 02:56.165
and keeps careful notes to
prevent logical inconsistencies.

02:56.199 --> 02:58.534
So... basically the star.

02:58.552 --> 03:00.803
We open on
a typical day at Greendale,

03:00.837 --> 03:02.271
only the students
all look happy

03:02.306 --> 03:03.973
and you can't smell that smell.

03:04.007 --> 03:05.257
Troy?

03:05.309 --> 03:06.876
"Why do I go Greendale?"

03:06.910 --> 03:08.394
"With three kids at home,

03:08.428 --> 03:10.062
you better believe
every penny counts."

03:10.097 --> 03:12.014
"To meet different people."

03:12.048 --> 03:13.716
And then, you and Troy hug--

03:13.734 --> 03:15.601
if you're comfortable with that.

03:15.652 --> 03:17.052
- Of course.
- Yeah, Troy and I are buds.

03:17.070 --> 03:19.071
Best buds. Air buds, even.

03:22.859 --> 03:24.744
Feeling stupid.

03:24.778 --> 03:27.747
And then, the camera pans,
and enter Dean Pelton.

03:27.781 --> 03:30.116
I got stuck with
the role of the dean.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.835
So I'm going to show him
how much of a dean I can be.

03:32.869 --> 03:36.172
And I've got a feeling
I won't make the cut.

03:36.206 --> 03:37.573
Welcome to Dean-Dale

03:37.591 --> 03:38.624
community colle-dean.

03:38.675 --> 03:40.459
I'm a silly goose.

03:40.510 --> 03:43.245
Honk, honk.
Dean-a-Lee-doo.

03:43.263 --> 03:44.263
- Look at me.
- Stop.

03:44.297 --> 03:46.081
This is my sister's outfit.

03:46.099 --> 03:48.351
Jeffrey, stop.

03:48.385 --> 03:50.603
You've hit gold.
Save some for the screen.

03:50.637 --> 03:52.254
All right, people,
scene six is up first.

03:52.272 --> 03:53.990
Oh, and I don't think
Pierce is coming back.

03:54.024 --> 03:55.608
Can someone fill in
as the pencil?

03:55.642 --> 03:58.260
Pierce Hawthorne,
screen of stage and star,

03:58.295 --> 04:01.147
will not leave this trailer
until he gets a trailer.

04:01.198 --> 04:04.633
And then I'm not leaving that
trailer until there's catering.

04:04.668 --> 04:06.502
And I'm not eating
the food until--

04:06.536 --> 04:08.170
And action.

04:08.205 --> 04:10.039
Why go Greendale?

04:10.073 --> 04:14.143
Just because, just dean it!
Dean machine.

04:14.177 --> 04:15.294
Got dean, got much,
much got--

04:15.328 --> 04:17.046
And cut.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.647
Oh, a star is born.

04:18.682 --> 04:20.983
I suggested to the dean
that we shoot my scenes

04:21.017 --> 04:23.019
in front of
the Luis Guzman statue

04:23.053 --> 04:24.670
because the dean
has no legal right

04:24.721 --> 04:26.722
to broadcast Guzman's image,

04:26.757 --> 04:29.125
which means every shot
will be unusable.

04:29.159 --> 04:31.427
I even put a call in to
Guzman's lawyers to alert them.

04:31.461 --> 04:33.429
I'm always willing
to go the extra mile

04:33.463 --> 04:34.797
to avoid doing something.

04:34.815 --> 04:36.232
Like sex with women.

04:36.266 --> 04:37.817
Shut up, Leonard,
you smell like mentholyptus.

04:37.851 --> 04:39.568
What are you even doing here?

04:39.603 --> 04:42.154
I'm thinking about
breaking into the tv game.

04:42.189 --> 04:44.824
Since it's apparently
sticking around.

04:44.858 --> 04:46.525
I don't want to wake up
in 30 years

04:46.576 --> 04:49.345
and wonder "what if?"

04:49.379 --> 04:52.114
"Because this full-time mama
ain't breaking the bank

04:52.149 --> 04:53.949
with your expensive tuition."

04:53.984 --> 04:55.051
Okay, cut.

04:55.085 --> 04:56.752
Shirley, the voice.

04:56.787 --> 05:00.039
Can you make it, um--
I thought it would be more s--

05:00.090 --> 05:04.360
What's another word that means
happy/threatening?

05:04.394 --> 05:06.429
The worde's looking for
is "sassy."

05:06.463 --> 05:08.431
He better pray
he don't find it.

05:09.499 --> 05:10.933
As soon as we get this shot,

05:10.967 --> 05:12.101
we are done.

05:12.135 --> 05:14.103
- Your phone is ringing.
- Oh.

05:14.137 --> 05:16.439
- Dean deaning.
- Dean Pelton?

05:16.473 --> 05:18.574
Hey, man, how you doing?
It's Luis Guzman.

05:18.608 --> 05:20.526
I hear you're making
a commercial for Greendale,

05:20.560 --> 05:22.695
and you need permission
to use my face or something?

05:22.729 --> 05:26.398
Well, I, um...
Uh...

05:26.450 --> 05:28.067
Well, why not
use the real thing?

05:28.118 --> 05:29.485
I'm sorry?

05:29.519 --> 05:31.454
I'm saying, I'd love
to be in your commercial.

05:31.488 --> 05:33.956
Wowee!

05:33.990 --> 05:37.860
A real big-time celebrity
wants to be in my commercial.

05:37.878 --> 05:39.862
Wowee.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.231
A real big time celebrity
wants to be in my commercial.

05:42.265 --> 05:43.466
- Come on down.
- Yeah, that's cool.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.134
But listen, I've got
to finish this movie,

05:45.168 --> 05:48.237
so, you know, I can't come for
a couple of weeks, all right?

05:48.271 --> 05:49.889
Mr. Guzman, Luis,
thank you.

05:49.923 --> 05:51.340
And can I just say,

05:51.374 --> 05:54.059
I loved you in--

05:54.094 --> 05:59.098
Innnnnnnn...

06:00.433 --> 06:02.434
IMDb.

06:02.486 --> 06:04.553
See you soon, man.

06:04.571 --> 06:07.055
That was tragic.

06:07.073 --> 06:09.825
The students here mean well,
they really do.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.661
But what Greendale has
always needed is a miracle.

06:12.696 --> 06:14.780
This is it.

06:14.831 --> 06:16.866
This is how I get
to put Greendale on the map.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.502
You know, I thought this
commercial was going to be okay.

06:19.536 --> 06:20.503
Well, guess what?

06:20.537 --> 06:22.454
It just officially
became great.

06:22.506 --> 06:24.123
Let me give you
a little rundown

06:24.174 --> 06:26.074
of this commercial's
great elements.

06:26.092 --> 06:30.112
Luis Guzman is in it.

06:32.649 --> 06:34.099
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?

06:34.134 --> 06:37.269
Everyone gather 'round,
quick announcement.

06:37.304 --> 06:38.988
Come on around.

06:39.022 --> 06:42.141
Everything that we shot so far
is worthless.

06:42.192 --> 06:43.425
I've thrown it out,

06:43.460 --> 06:44.927
and we're starting over
tomorrow morning.

06:44.961 --> 06:46.662
- Why?
- Because...

06:46.696 --> 06:50.649
Luis Guzman
is in the commercial now, so...

06:50.700 --> 06:52.434
Yeah. For realsies.

06:52.452 --> 06:56.872
Everyone, go home.
I'm rewriting all of your parts.

06:56.907 --> 06:58.874
Except for you, Jeffrey.

06:58.909 --> 07:01.276
You have locked
into something here.

07:01.294 --> 07:04.680
And the only thing
your character needs

07:04.714 --> 07:06.982
is more screen time.

07:07.017 --> 07:09.001
It's great that
he got a celebrity,

07:09.052 --> 07:11.086
- but why reshoot everything?
- Perfectionism.

07:11.121 --> 07:12.621
The dean's first step
down a road

07:12.656 --> 07:14.256
that ends
in self-destruction.

07:14.291 --> 07:16.510
That sounds...
Horrible.

07:16.630 --> 07:19.261
Actually, I might end up
taking this to some festivals.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.401
The dean's production has
taken over the entire school.

07:30.435 --> 07:31.499
Classes are shut down.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.308
The quilting club is being
forced to sew costumes.

07:33.428 --> 07:35.389
Two females, both 5'10",

07:35.423 --> 07:37.336
one brunette, one with asthma.

07:37.945 --> 07:40.113
He's also using the P.A.
system for casting calls.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.554
Okay, everyone--

07:41.588 --> 07:43.356
Does everyone have
their new script?

07:43.390 --> 07:46.492
Uh, it says I'm supposed to be
a book reading a book.

07:46.526 --> 07:47.660
That--that doesn't
make sense.

07:52.399 --> 07:54.150
What's this?

07:54.184 --> 07:56.135
Scene four.

07:56.153 --> 07:58.020
Last night, I had an epiphany.

07:58.071 --> 08:00.690
I'm ready to step
this mother up a notch.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.358
This commercial is going
to push every button,

08:02.409 --> 08:04.110
starting with the one
that is so hot,

08:04.144 --> 08:05.745
it will sizzle
your finger--

08:05.779 --> 08:07.830
racccccce.

08:07.864 --> 08:09.548
And action.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.984
"To meet
different people."

08:12.002 --> 08:14.370
Cut!
I'm coming in.

08:18.692 --> 08:22.545
I am trying to pull
a 400-year-old dagger

08:22.596 --> 08:27.833
out of this nation's heart,
and you two are hugging.

08:27.851 --> 08:29.885
Her, I understand, but you?

08:29.936 --> 08:31.053
What did I do?

08:31.104 --> 08:33.172
You didn't.
Let's take it again!

08:33.190 --> 08:36.342
"To meet
different people."

08:36.376 --> 08:38.010
Again.

08:38.028 --> 08:40.196
"To meet
different people."

08:40.230 --> 08:41.864
I need more!

08:41.898 --> 08:43.115
More!

08:43.150 --> 08:44.700
Wrong!
Fight the power!

08:44.735 --> 08:46.235
Fight it with your hugs.

08:46.286 --> 08:48.621
Tear down those walls.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.557
Okay, you get this wrong
one more time,

08:51.591 --> 08:54.026
I'm segregating the school.

08:54.044 --> 08:55.861
"To meet different people."

08:55.879 --> 08:58.197
You can't even do it
when we're helping you!

08:59.900 --> 09:00.900
Somebody help her!

09:00.934 --> 09:02.367
To meet different people!

09:02.385 --> 09:04.086
Stop saying I'm different!

09:04.137 --> 09:06.972
Dean, we've spent
12 hours on this scene.

09:07.007 --> 09:09.475
Maybe it's time
to move on to something else.

09:09.509 --> 09:12.261
I'm in Psych 101, and even I
don't know what's happening.

09:12.312 --> 09:15.047
The dean is going insane
and taking all of you with him.

09:15.082 --> 09:18.050
If you know that,
then do something!

09:18.085 --> 09:20.786
I'm doing everything I can.
I only have so many cameras.

09:23.774 --> 09:25.224
- Oh!
- Aah!

09:25.242 --> 09:28.393
I've spent an entire day
in this thing for no reason.

09:28.411 --> 09:30.746
What if the shoot drags on
for another day?

09:30.781 --> 09:32.531
Or, God forbid, two.

09:35.235 --> 09:36.769
And action, and move.

09:36.803 --> 09:38.471
"This full-time mama
ain't breaking the bank--"

09:38.505 --> 09:40.039
Cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut, cut--Garrett,

09:40.073 --> 09:42.758
you're not taking advantage of
the motion capture technology.

09:42.793 --> 09:44.477
You have to move.

09:44.511 --> 09:45.778
I forgot what I am again.

09:45.812 --> 09:48.647
Oh, for crying out--
you are a microscope!

09:48.682 --> 09:50.616
No, that's a toilet.

09:50.650 --> 09:52.918
No, that's clearly a frog
who can't get out of a box.

09:52.936 --> 09:55.104
Jeff thinks he has it bad?

09:55.138 --> 09:57.523
As Jeff's understudy,
I have to wear my Jeff wig

09:57.557 --> 10:00.626
on top of my Chang hair and
then my bald cap on top of that.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.311
There's no air
getting through here.

10:02.362 --> 10:04.113
I'm literally dying.

10:04.147 --> 10:06.615
But you'll never hear my story.

10:06.650 --> 10:09.034
I mean, now you heard it,
but... That was close.

10:09.069 --> 10:11.403
Are you sure you can't
work a little faster?

10:11.437 --> 10:12.771
Nobody asked for perfection.

10:12.789 --> 10:14.773
Well, perfection
is what you're getting.

10:14.791 --> 10:16.441
And if you don't like it,
you can fire me.

10:16.459 --> 10:18.110
Yeah, if we don't like it,

10:18.128 --> 10:20.746
at this point,
we definitely will fire you.

10:20.780 --> 10:24.283
Good.
That's how I like it. Ha!

10:24.301 --> 10:26.085
I'm surrounded by assassins.

10:26.119 --> 10:28.454
By own school's paper
has turned on me.

10:28.488 --> 10:29.955
But when this is all over,

10:29.990 --> 10:32.291
I'll have a commercial
with Luis Guzman in it,

10:32.309 --> 10:35.728
and all they'll have are
their words and their fears

10:35.762 --> 10:37.146
and whatever
embarrassing photos

10:37.180 --> 10:39.465
they can get from
my two-faced mother.

10:41.034 --> 10:42.468
Garrett, I've got
two men in diapers here.

10:42.502 --> 10:43.519
I know one of them is playing

10:43.570 --> 10:45.070
the dawn of a new era
in education,

10:45.105 --> 10:46.322
but I've got nothing
on the other one.

10:46.356 --> 10:48.340
Oh, um,
just a guest of the dean's.

10:48.375 --> 10:50.976
Well, both of you
go that way, then.

10:51.011 --> 10:52.995
The dean had
his seventh epiphany today,

10:53.029 --> 10:54.780
which has given me
an epiphany of my own.

10:54.814 --> 10:56.649
The dean is a genius.

10:56.683 --> 10:58.200
He has to be.

10:58.251 --> 11:00.219
If he isn't, I've given
almost two weeks of my life

11:00.253 --> 11:02.171
to an idiot.
That is unacceptable.

11:02.205 --> 11:05.024
Therefore the dean is a genius.

11:05.058 --> 11:07.493
And I will die
protecting his vision.

11:07.527 --> 11:10.429
Are you by any chance familiar
with Stockholm Syndrome?

11:10.463 --> 11:12.214
Is it something
that the dean created?

11:12.265 --> 11:13.682
Because if not, I don't care.

11:13.717 --> 11:16.302
We all wanna go,
but the dean won't let us.

11:16.336 --> 11:18.337
I think Pierce played this
the smartest from the beginning.

11:18.355 --> 11:20.105
He's probably at home
watching <i>Forensic Files</i>

11:20.140 --> 11:21.540
and eating cheesy popcorn.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.731
Well, about time.

11:28.782 --> 11:31.066
Hey, that's for Luis Guzman.

11:31.117 --> 11:35.404
Well, when you get me
my trailer, he can have it back.

11:35.455 --> 11:37.406
And make it
as nice as this one.

11:37.457 --> 11:39.825
Hey, Dean.
Dean? Hey, Dean!

11:39.859 --> 11:41.994
Pierce mistook me
for the dean today.

11:42.028 --> 11:45.564
- I want windows.
- How did that make you feel?

11:45.599 --> 11:47.566
I've become
a stranger to myself.

11:47.601 --> 11:51.220
I'm bald now.
I've always been bald.

11:51.254 --> 11:53.505
I merely dreamt of having hair.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.841
And now the bald man is awake.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.009
Jeff?

11:57.043 --> 11:58.928
It's time.

12:02.282 --> 12:06.018
Lights, camera, Dean.

12:06.052 --> 12:08.254
Action.

12:08.288 --> 12:11.690
Why go Greendale?
Just because!

12:11.724 --> 12:13.559
Cut.
Cut.

12:15.728 --> 12:17.196
Lose the bald cap.

12:17.230 --> 12:19.565
- What?
- I don't like it.

12:19.599 --> 12:21.066
It's hokey, it's fake.

12:21.084 --> 12:23.735
Take it off.

12:25.872 --> 12:27.606
No.

12:29.309 --> 12:32.577
I beg your pardon, actor?

12:32.595 --> 12:36.882
I have worn this stupid thing
for 12 days.

12:36.916 --> 12:38.300
I have made bald friends.

12:38.351 --> 12:40.185
Well, that's your mistake.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.388
Because it's a lie.
It's Hollywood crap.

12:42.422 --> 12:44.773
And I won't allow it
in my commercial.

12:44.808 --> 12:47.559
You're not bald.

12:47.594 --> 12:49.761
Yes, I am.

12:49.779 --> 12:52.998
Well, then, you're wrong
for the part!

12:53.033 --> 12:55.951
Understudy!

13:00.123 --> 13:02.408
That's it.

13:02.442 --> 13:05.644
That's reality.

13:05.679 --> 13:07.079
Winger, you're done.
Go home.

13:07.113 --> 13:08.881
Go home.

13:11.167 --> 13:13.185
Okay, I don't know why,
but this is the last straw.

13:13.219 --> 13:14.837
As a licensed psychology major,

13:14.888 --> 13:18.590
I am declaring this production
a violation of human rights.

13:18.624 --> 13:21.860
You have made us prisoners
of your insanity.

13:21.895 --> 13:23.162
Shut your face, Britta.

13:23.196 --> 13:25.014
If the dean wants his role

13:25.065 --> 13:27.983
to be played by a Chinese man
in a blond wig--

13:28.018 --> 13:30.135
Oh, my God, you are insane.

13:30.153 --> 13:31.803
All right, I'm sick and tired

13:31.821 --> 13:32.988
of hearing complaints

13:33.023 --> 13:35.107
that I'm forcing people
to be here.

13:35.141 --> 13:39.712
Anyone who doesn't want
to help me can leave!

13:41.000 --> 13:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:51.891 --> 13:54.676
- Abed, stop!
- Okay.

13:54.711 --> 13:56.541
Keep rolling.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.066
Hello?
Hello.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.451
Hello?

14:20.259 --> 14:24.379
Hello, it's me.
Luis Guzman.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.247
- Hello!
- Hi.

14:26.282 --> 14:30.602
Hi, Mr. Guzman,
Dean/Director Craig Pelton.

14:30.636 --> 14:33.054
Sorry, I've been editing.

14:33.088 --> 14:34.305
It's a ltle bit of a mess.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.092
What the --  is that?

14:38.110 --> 14:39.761
Oh, that's a possum.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.095
Once you spend
some time with them,

14:41.113 --> 14:45.867
you see they're just like
big, gentle rats.

14:45.901 --> 14:48.203
- Who's the guy?
- I'm no one.

14:48.237 --> 14:50.321
That's Abed.
He's a little bit odd.

14:50.373 --> 14:52.774
Now, without further ado,

14:52.808 --> 14:56.494
here is the commercial
you will be staring in.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.665
Why do I go Greendale?

15:06.338 --> 15:08.757
- Aah!
- What's in the box?

15:08.791 --> 15:10.825
Ohh...Oh...

15:13.863 --> 15:15.764
I've got to make a phone call.

15:15.798 --> 15:18.850
I had to tell this dean
I couldn't do his commercial.

15:18.901 --> 15:20.902
He didn't take that
too well either.

15:20.936 --> 15:22.470
Y'all gotta help this dude.

15:22.505 --> 15:23.822
I mean, aren't you his friends?

15:23.856 --> 15:25.940
I'm more of a fly on the wall.

15:25.974 --> 15:27.826
What is go--

15:27.860 --> 15:29.360
what?

15:29.412 --> 15:31.579
You won't be in my commercial,

15:31.614 --> 15:33.832
but you'll be in
his stupid documentary?

15:33.866 --> 15:35.650
All he does
is follow people around.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.619
Yeah, but haven't you seen
<i>Hearts of Darkness?</i>

15:37.653 --> 15:39.037
- Way better than--
- I want you

15:39.088 --> 15:41.423
the hell off of my campus,
you ungrateful backstabber.

15:41.457 --> 15:42.874
I already got rid
of your trailer.

15:42.925 --> 15:44.125
I had a trailer?

15:44.159 --> 15:46.044
Can anyone hear me?

15:46.095 --> 15:48.379
I will walk off
this production.

15:48.431 --> 15:51.015
I will quit!
Hello?

15:51.050 --> 15:53.017
I come here to shoot
this commercial for Greendale.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.836
That's what you had
written on the script.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.337
Ugh, that script was terrible.

15:56.355 --> 15:57.388
I thought it was pretty good.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.673
Of course you'd think that.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.275
You went here.

16:03.446 --> 16:06.231
Oh, I get it.

16:06.282 --> 16:09.016
You're worse than crazy.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.685
You're ashamed of your school.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.187
And that--that statue
of me out there,

16:13.205 --> 16:14.188
that's just wrong, man.

16:14.206 --> 16:15.623
Well, the bronze
adds ten pounds.

16:15.658 --> 16:17.358
- Nah, man--
- It's not going to be perfect.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.026
Screw you.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.963
I'm just saying, don't worship
the people leaving Greendale.

16:21.997 --> 16:23.998
Worship the people
that are here.

16:24.032 --> 16:27.585
Worship this place.
It changes people's life.

16:27.636 --> 16:30.672
Look, I loved my time here.
I got laid like crazy.

16:30.706 --> 16:32.807
That's way before
<i>Boogie Nights</i> too.

16:32.842 --> 16:36.911
Look, this is a special school.

16:40.149 --> 16:42.383
You don't deserve to be here.

16:49.057 --> 16:50.525
Are you still filming, Abed?

16:50.559 --> 16:52.076
Yeah, but try not
to address me.

16:52.111 --> 16:55.113
I'm not really here.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.582
Neither am I.

16:57.616 --> 17:01.736
I don't think I can finish
my commercial.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.405
But I think I know
how your documentary ends.

17:08.511 --> 17:10.044
Hi, I'm Craig Pelton,

17:10.078 --> 17:12.297
Dean of Greendale
Community College.

17:14.349 --> 17:16.550
I have failed this school.

17:16.585 --> 17:18.303
I have failed it
because I thought

17:18.354 --> 17:20.722
I was better than Greendale.

17:20.756 --> 17:23.107
See, I went to a university,

17:23.142 --> 17:26.310
so I thought it was my job
to improve this place.

17:26.362 --> 17:28.646
But it turns out that the only
thing wrong with Greendale

17:28.697 --> 17:30.899
is that it's run by
an insecure wreck

17:30.933 --> 17:33.968
who holds five dances
and two talent shows a year

17:34.003 --> 17:36.204
because he's afraid that
the school isn't good enough.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.607
But Greendale is good enough

17:39.642 --> 17:41.776
because it accepts me
for what I'm not.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.979
Greendale is the best school
in the entire world,

17:45.014 --> 17:49.517
and I'm so sorry
what I've done to it.

17:49.552 --> 17:51.786
And I'm sorry what I've done
to the ice cream machine.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.472
Aah!

17:54.506 --> 17:59.327
Please, no one eat out of it
until you clean the nozzles.

17:59.361 --> 18:01.829
The janitor knows how.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.632
I'm horrible.

18:05.734 --> 18:07.135
I'm horrible.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.272
Gentlemen, what I'm about
to show you

18:11.307 --> 18:13.775
is not the commercial
you paid me to create.

18:13.809 --> 18:15.026
What I am about to show you

18:15.077 --> 18:16.778
is a glimpse into
my mind and soul.

18:16.812 --> 18:18.780
Please hold your questions
until the end.

18:18.814 --> 18:20.481
I know you will have
a lot of them,

18:20.516 --> 18:23.818
but I'll understand
if you'd rather I just leave.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.791
Why do I go Greendale?

18:29.825 --> 18:31.709
The dean is a genius.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.294
To meet different people.

18:33.328 --> 18:34.712
With three kids at home,

18:34.763 --> 18:36.831
you better believe
every penny counts.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.634
I loved my time here.
I got laid like crazy.

18:39.668 --> 18:40.885
So why should you--

18:40.936 --> 18:42.053
Why should you--

18:42.104 --> 18:44.505
Why should you
go to Greendale?

18:44.540 --> 18:48.059
Greendale is the best school
in the entire world.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.746
Go Greendale,
go Greendale, go!

18:53.882 --> 18:54.899
It's good.

18:54.950 --> 18:55.984
Y-you know what,
better than good.

18:56.018 --> 18:57.201
Good enough.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.821
Is there any more
of the crazy Chinese guy?

18:59.855 --> 19:01.322
He pops.

19:01.356 --> 19:03.207
I'm confused.
That's not my commercial.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.742
I-I didn't make that.

19:04.793 --> 19:07.028
Yeah, yeah, okay, Zemeckis,
it moved through you.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.197
Anyway, congratulations.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.549
That should last us
another 16 years.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.501
So, uh, what's next?

19:13.535 --> 19:16.471
- Chump's rusty bucket?
- Quarter taps.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.344
- Did you do this?
- You did mostly.

19:23.378 --> 19:25.179
You got the footage
you needed on the first day.

19:25.213 --> 19:29.851
I added a little bit of
my footage to fill in the gaps.

19:29.885 --> 19:32.420
I thought you were
a fly on the wall.

19:32.454 --> 19:34.422
Some flies are too awesome
for the wall.

19:34.456 --> 19:36.424
Documentarians are supposed
to be objective,

19:36.458 --> 19:38.426
to avoid having
any effect on the story.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.361
And yet we have more effect
than anyone.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.729
Because we decide to tell it.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.114
And we decide how it ends.

19:43.165 --> 19:44.666
Will your story be
yet another sad one

19:44.700 --> 19:46.701
of yet another man
who just wanted to be happy?

19:46.735 --> 19:49.671
Or will your story acknowledge
the very nature of stories

19:49.705 --> 19:51.706
and embrace the fact
that sharing the sad ones

19:51.740 --> 19:53.074
can sometimes make them happy?

19:53.092 --> 19:54.592
Ugh.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.879
Before you say anything...

19:57.913 --> 19:59.263
Nope, I've got nothing.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.182
Can you just forgive me?

20:05.921 --> 20:07.438
Yep.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.757
Why?

20:09.775 --> 20:12.643
Because we've all been there.

20:12.695 --> 20:14.779
Which is why we're all here.

20:19.368 --> 20:23.104
Aww!

20:23.122 --> 20:24.489
I'm a good Dean?

20:24.540 --> 20:26.958
Yeah.

20:26.992 --> 20:31.079
Can someone help me get
a live possum out of my office?

20:31.113 --> 20:32.246
We could do that.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.299
It just keeps jumping
and skittering.

20:35.334 --> 20:38.119
And you think you're prepared,
and then it skitters again.

20:39.955 --> 20:41.122
Okay, scene's over.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.757
Hmm?

20:46.578 --> 20:50.078

They'll be ready for you
in 20 minutes, Mr. Garland.

20:57.025 --> 20:57.995
Great.

20:58.115 --> 20:59.938
I'm a star!

20:59.972 --> 21:01.373
Give me that.

21:01.407 --> 21:04.242
I will not be mitigated.

21:09.254 --> 21:10.348
Okay, you know what?

21:10.383 --> 21:12.100
I'm not coming out of
this trailer

21:12.135 --> 21:14.419
until I get a new trailer.

21:17.133 --> 21:19.149
And get me
a granola bar!
