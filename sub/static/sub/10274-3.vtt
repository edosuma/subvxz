00:01.770 --> 00:02.464
-Her great aunt?

00:03.170 --> 00:05.468
-E|izabeth, you may stay up for
a while and take care of her.

00:05.470 --> 00:06.334
-Mom!

00:06.340 --> 00:07.659
-Happy birthday, Henry!

00:07.660 --> 00:09.912
-That was a long
time to be away.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.501
How did the kids do?

00:11.510 --> 00:13.068
-I just told them my
aunt was too sick.

00:13.070 --> 00:15.584
I couldn't leave.

00:15.590 --> 00:17.490
We have to be able
to trust each other.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.194
-I know.

00:18.200 --> 00:18.894
I'm sorry.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.266
-Do we even know if this is the
first time she's checked on us?

00:21.270 --> 00:22.692
-I'm looking for
the phone number

00:22.700 --> 00:24.748
and address for Helen Levis.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.378
-We're taking the kid to the
rides at the park on Saturday.

00:27.380 --> 00:30.122
-I'd love to get a look
at Paige and Henry.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.495
-Jared's a senior?

00:31.500 --> 00:33.900
-He's going to Carnegie
Mellon next year.

00:33.910 --> 00:34.604
-Emmett?

00:38.180 --> 00:41.115
Paige and Henry, go!

00:41.120 --> 00:44.817
I saw him walking back to
the room when I was leaving.

00:47.550 --> 00:49.393
-They want us to check
out Emmett's agent.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.685
-Did you get the settings?

00:50.690 --> 00:51.543
-What settings?

00:51.550 --> 00:53.882
-The plant where they're
grinding the propellers

00:53.890 --> 00:54.595
is moving.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.851
It's the one chance
to get In there

00:55.860 --> 00:57.646
and read the settings
on the machine.

00:57.650 --> 01:00.335
-Mr. Dameran, I put my life
on the line to get here.

01:00.340 --> 01:03.389
-Last guy walked into the Soviet
Embassy, gave him the trigger

01:03.400 --> 01:05.834
designs they use
on all their nukes.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.659
-Bruce Dameran.

01:06.670 --> 01:09.230
-Purple heart in Vietnam,
Department of Agriculture--

01:09.240 --> 01:10.810
-Currently employed World Bank.

01:10.820 --> 01:16.474
_-I never worried about
Page and Henry being safe.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.792
How are we going
to live like this?

01:20.800 --> 01:21.869
-He shits a lot.

01:24.430 --> 01:25.510
Cries a lot too.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.977
He finally found
us something good.

01:27.980 --> 01:30.653
-How is Emmett handling it?

01:30.660 --> 01:32.093
-Oh, he's a natural.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.192
-Really?

01:33.200 --> 01:35.668
-I hear him sometimes
at night by the crib

01:35.680 --> 01:37.307
singing, "Here, there,
and everywhere."

01:37.310 --> 01:38.652
You know that Beatles song?

01:38.660 --> 01:39.979
-Yeah, I think so.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.503
-The revolver album is the best.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.696
What about you guys?

01:46.700 --> 01:48.099
Have you started trying?

01:48.100 --> 01:49.169
-No.

01:49.170 --> 01:51.126
-When do you think?

01:51.130 --> 01:52.848
-I'm not sure.

01:52.850 --> 01:55.774
I mean, it's not something
I've always wanted.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.054
-Kids?

01:57.060 --> 01:58.504
-Not really.

01:58.510 --> 01:59.966
-I wouldn't tell
the centre that.

02:02.790 --> 02:06.055
Listen, I need to
ask you something.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.381
-OK.

02:08.390 --> 02:09.539
-It's hard to
trust anyone, but I

02:09.540 --> 02:11.462
feel like I can
tell you anything.

02:11.470 --> 02:12.209
-You can.

02:12.210 --> 02:12.904
What's wrong?

02:12.910 --> 02:13.604
-Nothing.

02:13.610 --> 02:14.827
Nothing at all.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.639
I just need you
to do me a favour.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.334
-There he is.

02:54.630 --> 02:55.324
-Looks good.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.562
-How long have
you been watching?

03:00.570 --> 03:01.730
-Not long enough.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.267
-Any word?

03:11.270 --> 03:15.229
-We drive to Newport News
as soon as you're dressed?

03:15.230 --> 03:17.095
-Seriously?

03:17.100 --> 03:19.261
What about the kids?

03:19.270 --> 03:22.319
-The centre is going
to put someone on them.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.014
Limited.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.203
Just while we're not here.

03:24.210 --> 03:25.199
-I don't like it.

03:25.210 --> 03:28.020
-They'll never see it.

03:28.030 --> 03:28.803
We'll never see it.

03:28.810 --> 03:31.529
-Is this supposed to
make us feel better?

03:31.530 --> 03:33.498
-I think so, yes.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.359
-Do you feel better?

04:23.250 --> 04:24.547
-It's not going to work.

04:24.550 --> 04:25.619
-How do you know?

04:25.630 --> 04:27.484
-'Cause you bought it out
of the back of a comic book.

04:27.490 --> 04:29.822
-IF I can just attach
these two pieces.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.138
-Attach what?

04:31.140 --> 04:31.834
My star wheel.

04:34.910 --> 04:36.468
-Let me see.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.278
-See, what you're supposed
to do is rotate the wheel

04:39.290 --> 04:42.088
to the time you want, and then
match it with the real stars.

04:42.100 --> 04:45.513
I really want to memorise
the constellations.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.545
-Knock yourself out.

04:47.550 --> 04:48.244
-Thanks, Dad.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.274
That's awesome.

04:49.280 --> 04:49.985
-Yes, I am.

04:49.990 --> 04:50.684
-See, Paige?

04:50.690 --> 04:51.315
-Whatever.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.685
-We may be a little
late at work tonight.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.362
Can you look after your brother?

04:54.370 --> 04:55.064
-Yeah, sure.

04:55.070 --> 04:56.162
-And we should be
home by dinner.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.967
-You know, Salisbury
steak is technically

05:00.970 --> 05:04.997
hamburger in the
shape of a steak.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.888
-Come here.

05:06.900 --> 05:07.719
-What?

05:07.720 --> 05:09.290
-Just, come here.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.399
You 're wearing
too much lip gloss.

05:20.040 --> 05:20.836
You're so beautiful.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.125
You don't need it.

05:32.910 --> 05:33.604
-Oh.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.134
-Hey.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.949
-Hey.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.654
-Want coffee?

05:50.660 --> 05:51.422
-Sure, that'd be great.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.769
Are you going somewhere?

05:56.770 --> 05:59.921
-Yeah, I have my first seminar
for the Werner Erhard course,

05:59.930 --> 06:02.125
the one that Dawn and Mary did.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.529
-Ah, right, right.

06:03.540 --> 06:08.136
-They said it just
transformed their lives.

06:08.140 --> 06:10.028
There you go, careful.

06:10.030 --> 06:12.988
-You look nice.

06:12.990 --> 06:15.379
-Thanks.

06:15.390 --> 06:17.995
Huh, so how was your night?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.891
-I watched a guy do
laundry all night.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.687
What single guy does
four loads of laundry?

06:24.690 --> 06:28.638
-What married guy does
four loads of laundry?

06:28.640 --> 06:31.803
-That's a good point.

06:31.810 --> 06:33.300
-Matthew's in the shower.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.629
So--

06:34.640 --> 06:35.800
-OK, I got him.

06:35.810 --> 06:36.504
-OK.

06:36.510 --> 06:38.341
-Go, have fun.

06:38.350 --> 06:39.374
-No,no.

06:39.380 --> 06:45.432
It's not fun, Stan,
it's work on myself.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.022
-That's what I meant.

06:48.030 --> 06:48.724
-OK.

06:56.410 --> 06:58.901
-Hey Henry, after school
a few of the girls

06:58.910 --> 07:00.286
are going into
Georgetown to buy jeans.

07:00.290 --> 07:02.781
You'll be OK by yourself
for a few hours, right?

07:02.790 --> 07:04.530
-Yeah, sure, I
won't say anything.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.235
-Thanks, I appreciate it.

07:06.240 --> 07:06.934
-Yeah.

07:24.050 --> 07:25.540
-Cobbler said
General Westmoreland

07:25.550 --> 07:30.396
is going to ask for
100,000 more troops.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.697
-You have to put this out now.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.530
-I did.

07:32.540 --> 07:35.179
I made a drop at the site
at 14th, by the embassy.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.886
- You brought
with you?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.050
-He was worth it
in this situation.

07:45.750 --> 07:49.538
-The centre heard there's a
new assessment at the Pentagon.

07:49.540 --> 07:52.270
They know two people
who have access to it

07:52.280 --> 07:54.851
and they want you to try
one of them tomorrow night.

08:00.250 --> 08:03.902
-This war, they're
killing everyone.

08:03.910 --> 08:07.141
They're never going to stop.

08:07.150 --> 08:07.844
-I know.

08:11.090 --> 08:11.784
I know.

08:23.810 --> 08:24.504
-I'm ready.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.657
-Are you sure?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.609
-You'll make a good father.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.360
-You all right?

09:12.370 --> 09:14.918
-I made a few phone calls.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.593
He's been taken in by a family.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.580
-Jared?

09:20.590 --> 09:23.081
-Friend of Emmett and Leann's.

09:23.090 --> 09:26.981
People who used to
babysit for her.

09:26.990 --> 09:30.448
-Well, it's a shred
of decent news.

09:36.890 --> 09:38.721
You don't have to do it.

09:38.730 --> 09:40.129
-I made a promise.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.062
-The police could be
watching the house.

09:42.070 --> 09:42.764
-I know.

09:42.770 --> 09:43.646
-You want a soda?

09:46.310 --> 09:49.404
-What if this happens to us?

09:49.410 --> 09:51.571
Who's going to take the kids?

09:51.580 --> 09:52.569
-The Beemans.

09:52.570 --> 09:53.309
-I'm serious, Phillip.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.386
We don't have any real friends.

10:03.390 --> 10:04.880
-Isn't that how you wanted it?

10:04.890 --> 10:06.209
-Me?

10:06.220 --> 10:07.494
What's that supposed to mean?

10:07.500 --> 10:08.717
-I don't know, Elizabeth.

10:15.660 --> 10:17.730
-I hate it when they have
to rush these things.

10:36.350 --> 10:38.818
-I never knew there was so
much corn this close to DC.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.603
-Excuse me?

10:43.610 --> 10:45.350
-50 miles and you're
in the boonies.

10:48.030 --> 10:50.169
-You do this trip a lot?

10:50.180 --> 10:51.875
-Every week.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.110
To see my dad.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.553
-He lives up here.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.006
-He and my mom can't
live in the same state.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.230
-Seriously?

11:02.240 --> 11:04.868
-I mean, they can legally.

11:04.870 --> 11:06.417
But they won't.

11:06.420 --> 11:10.356
I'm going up and back tonight,
because my mom doesn't want me

11:10.360 --> 11:13.261
staying with him on a
night that's not his.

11:13.270 --> 11:14.237
-Yikes.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.174
-Yep.

11:16.180 --> 11:18.535
Why aren't you in school today?

11:18.540 --> 11:23.318
-Um, I'm going to see my aunt.

11:23.330 --> 11:25.116
-You don't sound so
psyched about it.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.064
-No, no, I am.

11:26.070 --> 11:28.982
I'm just-- I'm surprising her.

11:31.910 --> 11:33.400
-What was his injury?

11:33.410 --> 11:37.289
-Bullet in the right hip,
shattered his pelvis.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.440
He ended up at Walter
Reed for two years.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.577
-Walter Reed.

11:42.580 --> 11:47.392
Makes me think of peeling
paint, every single wall.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.413
I came back from Kason
with third-degree burns

11:49.420 --> 11:51.399
on both legs.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.219
-I didn't know.

11:52.220 --> 11:56.338
-I was only in the ward a
month, but, uh, I can tell you,

11:56.340 --> 11:58.376
those guys who are
in there for years?

11:58.380 --> 12:00.962
It's their life.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.915
Their new life.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.252
-I was in the FBI at the time.

12:05.260 --> 12:07.160
So was I but I
volunteered anyway.

12:13.940 --> 12:16.306
-Dameran was top at
his high school class.

12:16.310 --> 12:19.700
Did a year at Purdue before
he lost the deferment.

12:19.710 --> 12:23.897
Maybe he gets out of Walter
Reed, tries to restart the life

12:23.900 --> 12:25.720
he dreamed about in college.

12:25.730 --> 12:27.140
But it's tough.

12:27.150 --> 12:30.301
He gets a dead-end desk at
the Department of Agriculture,

12:30.310 --> 12:33.268
ends up pushing pencils
at the World Bank.

12:33.270 --> 12:35.067
-Not a bad KGB target.

12:35.070 --> 12:35.991
-Except they don't find him.

12:36.000 --> 12:36.773
He finds them.

12:44.620 --> 12:47.578
-Hi, we're with SBN
Secure Transport.

12:47.580 --> 12:50.003
-Driver's licences.

12:50.010 --> 12:53.798
Waiting for you
by the main shop.

12:53.800 --> 12:54.767
-Excuse me.

12:54.770 --> 12:56.442
Are you the people
supervising the move?

12:56.450 --> 12:59.214
What the hell's going on
with the debris pickup?

12:59.220 --> 13:01.359
I've got two tonnes of junk
sitting out on the north dock.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.009
-I can get that answer for you.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.885
-You folks are moving too slow.

13:04.890 --> 13:07.836
We need to be fully operational
in Portsmouth by Tuesday.

13:07.840 --> 13:08.943
-It'|| happen.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.394
-Yeah.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.277
-We've got a new facility
up there-- courtesy

13:12.280 --> 13:14.168
of the Reagan military budget.

13:14.180 --> 13:15.670
Thank god, because
this place is falling

13:15.680 --> 13:17.989
apart, but still
moving's a bitch.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.649
-Well, we're here
to help, so I'll

13:19.660 --> 13:20.695
go check on the north dock.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.725
Jackie, do you need to handle
the mill situation, right away.

13:22.730 --> 13:22.855
-I should.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.543
Why don't you attend
to this gentleman--

13:24.550 --> 13:24.845
-Sure.

13:24.850 --> 13:26.181
---and I will track you
down when you're done.

13:26.190 --> 13:26.997
-Perfect.

13:27.000 --> 13:27.694
-Excuse me.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.099
Is there a quicker
route to the mill?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.374
I didn't wear my sneakers today?

13:30.380 --> 13:31.677
-Through the cavitation tunnel.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.374
-Thank you so much.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.757
-Yep.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.763
-They split up for a while,
like, a few months ago.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.021
-But they're back together?

13:39.030 --> 13:39.917
-Yeah.

13:39.920 --> 13:40.989
-That's good.

13:40.990 --> 13:42.981
-I guess so, yeah.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.686
They're pretty private
about stuff like that.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.430
Everything, actually.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.452
-Aren't all parents?

13:48.460 --> 13:50.303
-Yeah, I guess.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.473
-It's just, it
feels like there's

13:53.480 --> 13:56.711
always something going on.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.645
I thought maybe one of them was
having an affair or something.

14:00.650 --> 14:02.993
I'd just really
love to like know.

14:05.790 --> 14:07.576
-This is me.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.242
-Thanks for making
this trip fly by.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.788
It always feels better to have
someone to talk to, doesn't it?

14:13.790 --> 14:15.098
-Yeah, totally.

14:15.100 --> 14:21.312
-Here, um, give me a
call when you get back.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.096
You know, if you
want to hang out

14:24.100 --> 14:26.148
with other people who get it.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.815
-Hi there.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.708
-Hi.

14:52.710 --> 14:53.654
-Can I help you?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.059
-What's your name?

14:55.060 --> 14:55.754
-Derek.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.967
-Great, I'm Jackie with
the moving company.

14:57.970 --> 15:00.598
I need to find a C and
C cylindrical grinder.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.431
They want extra
padding in the crate.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.055
The nine axis C and C?

15:04.060 --> 15:05.948
-Yeah.

15:05.950 --> 15:07.429
-It's in Annapolis.

15:07.430 --> 15:11.059
It was moved
yesterday by the DOD.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.823
-What'd you say your name was?

15:12.830 --> 15:18.063
-Jackie Macklehend.

15:18.070 --> 15:19.332
-I'm going to go
call my supervisor.

15:20.060 --> 15:20.754
-Hang on a second.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.747
-Yeah, I mean, I don't think we
need to bother your supervisor.

15:30.390 --> 15:34.326
You're sure the machine_has
been moved off the premises?

15:34.330 --> 15:36.309
-Pretty sure, yeah.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.120
-Wow, my boss is really
going to kill me.

15:39.130 --> 15:42.520
Is there another C and C
on site here, that maybe

15:42.530 --> 15:44.612
I could measure, or--

15:44.620 --> 15:46.872
-Not that exact one.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.939
I mean, there are
other machines.

15:48.950 --> 15:50.906
Would that help?

15:50.910 --> 15:53.174
-Mm-mm.

15:53.180 --> 15:56.957
Do you operate the
machine I'm looking for?

15:56.960 --> 15:57.779
Derek.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.815
-I clean it.

15:59.820 --> 16:02.368
That's all I do.

16:02.370 --> 16:04.702
-What are we going to
do about this, Derek?

16:04.710 --> 16:06.530
I mean--

16:06.540 --> 16:09.919
-Wait, the blades
that machine grinds?

16:09.930 --> 16:10.851
They haven't been moved yet.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.896
They're still in the dry dock.

16:12.900 --> 16:13.730
-The blades?

16:13.740 --> 16:16.288
-Yeah, I saw plans with them
that are marked classified.

16:16.290 --> 16:19.828
But you probably have clearance.

16:19.830 --> 16:21.878
-Which way is the dry dock?

16:21.880 --> 16:22.574
-This way.

16:26.980 --> 16:29.346
-You know the new plant is
going to be closer to my house.

16:29.350 --> 16:32.137
And I'm going to get
to see my kids more.

16:36.110 --> 16:38.578
This-- this is them.

16:38.580 --> 16:44.268
That's Lucas, and Ryan,
and-- and that's Danny.

16:52.130 --> 16:52.858
-Three boys.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.999
They must keep you on your feet.

16:55.010 --> 16:55.977
-They do.

17:00.870 --> 17:01.939
They expect me home for supper.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.580
-I can't see any reason
why you'd miss it, can you?

17:14.530 --> 17:15.519
Let's go.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.558
The grinding machine made this?

17:36.560 --> 17:37.254
-Yeah.

17:37.260 --> 17:39.069
-Jackie.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.219
Hey, take a look.

17:41.220 --> 17:42.482
This guy from the
mill's going to help

17:42.490 --> 17:43.536
us with our packing problem.

17:46.270 --> 17:47.259
-That's what you need, right?

17:47.270 --> 17:48.237
-Why don't we wait over here?

18:29.650 --> 18:30.344
-Hello?

18:35.320 --> 18:36.014
Anyone home?

18:38.670 --> 18:39.364
Hello?

18:43.670 --> 18:44.819
Aunt Helen?

19:00.960 --> 19:03.030
-Sloppy movers.

19:03.040 --> 19:03.734
Let's go Jackie.

19:09.750 --> 19:10.830
-I can't do what you wanted.

19:13.210 --> 19:13.904
Please.

19:16.680 --> 19:17.749
-Can I see your pictures again?

19:33.230 --> 19:34.219
Danny, right?

20:17.660 --> 20:19.423
-Oh!

20:19.430 --> 20:22.149
You're here.

20:22.150 --> 20:23.777
I should have wore
something different,

20:23.780 --> 20:26.010
or done up my hair, or--

20:26.020 --> 20:27.066
-Helen?

20:27.070 --> 20:29.163
-I'll make up your
room right away.

20:29.170 --> 20:33.539
And I'll get out your Raggedy
Ann lamp, and then we can eat.

20:33.540 --> 20:36.589
I'm happy you're home, Shelly.

20:36.590 --> 20:39.582
-Wait, I'm not Shelly.

20:39.590 --> 20:41.080
I'm Paige.

20:41.090 --> 20:43.001
Elizabeth's daughter.

20:43.010 --> 20:43.704
-I don't understand.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.856
-We need to initiate
a covert Investigation

20:55.860 --> 20:57.703
into one of your employees.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.439
Now the vice chairman
and you are the only two

20:59.450 --> 21:00.758
people who can know about this.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.614
-I understand.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.407
-What can you tell me
about Bruce Dameran.

21:05.410 --> 21:06.342
-Dameran.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.580
He's a relatively new hire.

21:08.590 --> 21:09.318
Let me see.

21:13.820 --> 21:15.708
-Did they change the
dress code around here?

21:15.720 --> 21:17.699
-Uh-- could you imagine?

21:17.710 --> 21:18.802
He!

21:18.810 --> 21:21.734
No, we have an event today
with our new chief executive.

21:21.740 --> 21:25.221
My wife said my dress shoes
were too scuffed, so--

21:25.230 --> 21:27.607
-They look sharp.

21:27.610 --> 21:29.475
-Is Mr. Dameran in trouble?

21:29.480 --> 21:33.484
-At this juncture, we're
just gathering information.

21:33.490 --> 21:35.242
-This is his most recent review.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.069
His only review.

21:36.070 --> 21:37.469
He's only been here six months.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.391
Nothing out of the ordinary.

21:42.830 --> 21:44.946
-Is he on a group
or a team you can

21:44.950 --> 21:46.815
call upstairs for a meeting?

21:46.820 --> 21:48.424
I'd like to walk by his desk.

21:48.430 --> 21:49.124
-Yeah, sure.

21:51.980 --> 21:53.675
-Steven, it's Gary.

21:53.680 --> 21:57.434
Can you send the DWG
market analysis group up?

21:57.440 --> 21:58.668
Really?

21:58.680 --> 21:59.374
Got it.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.814
Thanks.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.094
Dameran called in sick today.

22:06.430 --> 22:08.466
-He'|| stay quiet.

22:08.470 --> 22:11.189
-Better than having
him disappear.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.328
If you're going to make it
home for dinner, you should go.

22:14.330 --> 22:15.570
-Sorry?

22:15.580 --> 22:17.878
-There's a 410 train,
I'll drop you off.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.188
-Where are you going?

22:19.190 --> 22:19.884
-You know where.

23:02.120 --> 23:04.099
-You said he's been
here six months?

23:04.110 --> 23:06.453
There's hardly
anything in his office.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.870
-I haven't checked.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.643
-That World Bank event
you mentioned today.

23:10.870 --> 23:12.963
-The board of governors
and executive directors

23:12.970 --> 23:14.597
from England, France,
Germany, and Spain.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.862
-And where is it?

23:15.870 --> 23:18.327
-The Marquee Hotel, in
the Jefferson ballroom.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.171
Boring, but classic.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.011
-The Marquee on D Street?

23:21.020 --> 23:21.725
-That's the one.

23:21.730 --> 23:22.424
-Call 9-1-1.

23:22.430 --> 23:23.545
Tell them to go there.

24:38.670 --> 24:41.980
FBI, don't move!

24:41.990 --> 24:44.231
You don't want to die, Bruce.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.299
That's not why
you're doing this.

24:46.310 --> 24:49.086
Why don't you put
that rifle down?

24:49.090 --> 24:51.752
We can talk.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.250
-FBI.

24:53.260 --> 24:55.251
What, you're here to
protect the World Bank.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.888
Do you know who they are?

24:57.890 --> 25:00.905
What they do to ordinary
people like me and you?

25:00.910 --> 25:04.118
-Why don't you tell me about it?

25:04.120 --> 25:06.031
I want to help you, Bruce.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.302
Let me help you.

25:10.020 --> 25:11.112
-You know, when
I was in Vietnam,

25:11.120 --> 25:15.238
they told me who the enemy
was and I believed them.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.571
But when I got home,
do you know what I saw?

25:17.580 --> 25:20.458
-What?

25:20.460 --> 25:22.678
-I saw the real enemy.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.489
And it's right here.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.139
The men who own everything.

25:26.140 --> 25:27.425
-OK.

25:27.430 --> 25:31.059
OK, let's talk that through.

25:31.060 --> 25:35.963
-No, I have to do something.

25:35.970 --> 25:38.165
The only reason that they
get away with everything,

25:38.170 --> 25:39.398
that they're able
to take advantage--

25:39.400 --> 25:40.651
-Don't move that gun, Bruce.

25:40.660 --> 25:42.366
---nobody ever does anything.

25:42.370 --> 25:43.189
Nobody cares.

25:43.190 --> 25:44.669
-Stop moving the gun!

25:44.680 --> 25:46.659
-Ronald Reagan doesn't care!

26:05.550 --> 26:06.949
-What was the favour
you wanted to ask?

26:12.370 --> 26:16.477
-Emmett and I wrote
a letter to our son,

26:16.480 --> 26:20.359
in case anything
ever happens to us.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.849
-Tell me.

26:21.860 --> 26:26.888
-I just-- I'd want
him to know the truth.

26:26.890 --> 26:35.138
Who we are, and where we
come from, what we do.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.747
You can understand that, right?

26:45.190 --> 26:47.397
If it ever comes to that--

26:47.400 --> 26:48.799
-I'll give it to him.

26:48.810 --> 26:49.504
I promise.

28:35.890 --> 28:39.018
-I was so relieved
when I got your Signal.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.373
-Hm.

28:40.380 --> 28:44.032
-They said there wasn't
any evidence around.

28:44.040 --> 28:47.464
-We||, these things happen.

28:47.470 --> 28:49.859
-I'm glad you're safe.

28:49.860 --> 28:53.205
-If it weren't for you, Ava,
I'd have killed a lot of people.

28:53.210 --> 28:55.155
-If it weren't for you, not me.

28:55.160 --> 28:55.854
-I know.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.077
I was just doing my job.

29:03.010 --> 29:04.272
They say they want
to give me a medal.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.009
-All my life they tell us
terrible things about you.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.218
You oppress your own people.

29:16.230 --> 29:17.731
You want to destroy us.

29:20.370 --> 29:21.064
Then I meet you.

29:24.390 --> 29:28.099
I'm proud of you, Stan.

29:28.110 --> 29:29.486
-I love you, Nina.

29:37.700 --> 29:38.394
-Hello?

29:42.050 --> 29:43.881
-Anybody home?

29:43.890 --> 29:44.584
Paige?

29:44.590 --> 29:45.329
Henry?

29:45.330 --> 29:46.024
-Here Dad!

29:49.060 --> 29:49.754
Hey!

29:49.760 --> 29:51.204
What's going on?

29:51.210 --> 29:54.794
-Hey, I'm just going to
find Polaris tonight.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.267
The North star?

29:56.270 --> 29:58.329
-Yeah, I have heard of it.

29:58.340 --> 30:01.013
-Stays in the same place all
year, no matter what time.

30:01.020 --> 30:04.274
And all the other
stars rotate around it.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.089
-So you can always count on it.

30:06.090 --> 30:07.022
-Exactly.

30:07.030 --> 30:10.181
Well, if you can find it.

30:10.190 --> 30:12.408
-Where's your sister?

30:12.420 --> 30:15.753
-She had to stay late at school.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.967
-Is that right?

30:17.970 --> 30:19.289
-Yeah, but don't be mad.

30:19.290 --> 30:20.803
She bought me home,
and then she went

30:20.810 --> 30:23.381
to go try out for some
club or something.

30:23.390 --> 30:25.301
Clubs are good for your
college application.

30:25.310 --> 30:27.244
And you were right.

30:27.250 --> 30:28.103
-About what?

30:28.110 --> 30:30.988
-Road and Track says the
228 is the front-runner

30:30.990 --> 30:31.684
for car of the year.

30:34.690 --> 30:36.487
Oh, but I still think you
should get a Corvette.

30:36.490 --> 30:37.343
-Hello?

30:37.350 --> 30:38.886
-Good evening, Phillip.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.168
-It's Aunt Helen.

30:44.170 --> 30:48.129
I just wanted to tell you,
Paige came to visit today.

30:48.140 --> 30:51.689
She should be on
her way home by now.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.543
-Thank you for letting me know.

31:25.690 --> 31:28.488
-Hi, I'm Ann Chadwick from
the child advocacy centre.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.649
We spoke on the phone.

31:29.660 --> 31:30.490
You must be Nancy.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.354
-Yes, hi, come in please.

31:37.010 --> 31:38.944
-The state mandates
these visits.

31:38.950 --> 31:40.895
It's the only way to know
how he's acclimating.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.902
-It's so soon.

31:42.910 --> 31:45.231
-A child's adjustments
starts on day one,

31:45.240 --> 31:47.344
especially for trauma victims.

31:47.350 --> 31:49.989
Their entire understanding
of trust has been shattered.

31:49.990 --> 31:51.969
-Oh, of course.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.392
-Do you know Jared well?

31:53.400 --> 31:56.267
-Oh, we adore him.

31:56.270 --> 31:59.250
Been overpaying him to
babysit for a few years now.

31:59.260 --> 32:03.742
It's up to $8 an hour
to keep him coming back.

32:03.750 --> 32:06.526
-What is it about him?

32:06.530 --> 32:09.215
-He's amazing with the kids.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.734
Gets my son to do his homework.

32:11.740 --> 32:13.446
Taught him to play the guitar.

32:13.450 --> 32:16.226
He's got an amazing voice.

32:16.230 --> 32:19.347
-I didn't know that.

32:19.350 --> 32:21.921
-We had to do something to help.

32:21.930 --> 32:25.343
Even if it's only a year
until he goes to college.

32:25.350 --> 32:28.911
-The thing he needs most
now is to feel safe.

32:28.920 --> 32:32.424
That's all kids really want.

32:32.430 --> 32:34.318
Would it be OK ifI had a
few minutes alone with him?

32:57.090 --> 32:59.069
-You're home.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.433
-Dad, uh, sorry.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.839
I got stuck at school.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.149
Did I tell you I'm trying
out for the debate club?

33:04.160 --> 33:05.149
-No.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.879
-Well, it's super competitive.

33:06.890 --> 33:08.755
You have to prepare
a subject to debate.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.239
And I'm doing the
ethical ramifications

33:10.240 --> 33:13.653
of test tube babies.

33:13.660 --> 33:16.606
-Good luck with that.

33:16.610 --> 33:18.396
-Um, where's mom?

33:18.400 --> 33:19.765
-She had to go by the office.

33:19.770 --> 33:21.169
She'll be home in a bit.

33:21.180 --> 33:22.920
Have a seat.

33:22.930 --> 33:23.851
-I have homework to do.

33:23.860 --> 33:26.818
-Paige, sit please.

33:42.060 --> 33:44.858
Lying will not be tolerated.

33:44.860 --> 33:45.554
-What do you mean?

33:50.370 --> 33:55.103
-Aunt Helen called to say
her daughter came to visit.

33:55.110 --> 33:58.079
Her daughter who
died in 1974 And who

33:58.080 --> 34:00.583
now apparently has red hair.

34:00.590 --> 34:01.682
That's when I
called your school.

34:01.690 --> 34:02.839
How is your strep throat?

34:02.850 --> 34:03.532
-I'm sorry.

34:06.520 --> 34:11.219
-This is the most irresponsible
thing you have ever done.

34:11.230 --> 34:14.654
I, I don't even
know what to say.

34:14.660 --> 34:16.298
-She's our only living relative.

34:16.300 --> 34:17.528
I wanted to meet her.

34:17.530 --> 34:20.624
-You were under firm
instructions to be at home.

34:20.630 --> 34:21.904
-OK.

34:21.910 --> 34:22.604
Fine.

34:22.610 --> 34:28.037
-Watch it, young lady.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.429
I am sorry we don't
have more of a family,

34:30.430 --> 34:34.446
but your mother and I have
worked hard to create this one.

34:34.450 --> 34:36.577
I lost my father when I was six.

34:36.580 --> 34:39.743
Six years old, do
you understand that?

34:39.750 --> 34:43.254
You're lucky to
have what you have.

34:43.260 --> 34:43.954
-Am I excused?

34:47.580 --> 34:49.923
-Tell me you understand.

34:49.930 --> 34:50.624
-Yes.

34:55.390 --> 34:56.084
-Good.

35:19.290 --> 35:20.769
-In love with you, Nina.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.729
I love you, Nina.

37:10.530 --> 37:11.212
-Are you sleeping?

37:14.070 --> 37:15.059
-Sort of.

37:15.060 --> 37:18.552
Yeah, I don't know.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.278
-But you're comfortable here?

37:24.050 --> 37:27.053
The advocacy centre
is committed to giving

37:27.060 --> 37:29.415
you anything that you need.

37:29.420 --> 37:32.366
You know you're entitled to a
leave of absence from school.

37:32.370 --> 37:35.055
-No, I'll go.

37:35.060 --> 37:35.879
-To school?

37:38.940 --> 37:39.998
No one expects you to.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.194
-My parents would.

37:53.010 --> 37:54.671
-This is going to
be a process, Jared.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.004
Healing takes time.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.159
Especially when
there are no answers.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.909
-I've had this ear infection.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.195
-I'm sorry?

38:19.200 --> 38:20.997
-I didn't go to the
doctor, or anything,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.139
but you know when
you can just tell?

38:23.140 --> 38:23.834
-Yeah.

38:29.250 --> 38:32.185
-My mom didn't.

38:32.190 --> 38:33.293
She didn't want me in the pool.

38:38.410 --> 38:41.937
If I'd-- god, if I
didn't go swimming.

38:41.940 --> 38:42.634
If I didn't--

38:42.640 --> 38:45.074
-Oh, no, no, no.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.286
None of this is your fault.

38:46.290 --> 38:47.518
Do you understand that?

38:47.520 --> 38:48.589
None of this is your fault.

39:58.960 --> 39:59.722
-Kel|y?

39:59.730 --> 40:02.073
It's Paige.

40:02.080 --> 40:02.774
You too!

40:02.780 --> 40:04.008
Hey, do you want to hang out?
