00:01.967 --> 00:05.482
Captain's log, stardate 46071.6.

00:05.567 --> 00:08.286
We have been called to aid
a transport ship

00:08.367 --> 00:10.437
attacked near Rekag-Seronia.

00:10.527 --> 00:14.566
Hostilities between two factions
on that planet have intensified,

00:14.647 --> 00:18.037
threatening an important
Federation shipping route.

00:18.127 --> 00:21.085
Captain, sensors have located
the transport ship.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.476
Two Rekag battle cruisers
are flanking it.

00:23.567 --> 00:25.444
Red alert. Shields up.

00:25.527 --> 00:28.166
Phasers on line. Torpedoes ready.

00:28.247 --> 00:30.363
Is the transport still under attack?

00:30.447 --> 00:32.961
The cruisers' weapons
are powered up.

00:33.047 --> 00:36.039
The Rekag ships
are heading out of range.

00:36.127 --> 00:37.719
They won't take us on.

00:37.807 --> 00:40.719
- We're within visual range.
- On screen.

00:40.807 --> 00:43.879
Sensors indicate damage
to the Dorian subspace emitter.

00:44.687 --> 00:48.123
- Audio communication only.
- Open a channel, Mr. Worf.

00:48.207 --> 00:49.686
Aye, sir.

00:50.247 --> 00:54.525
This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of
the Federation Starship Enterprise.

00:54.607 --> 00:58.566
Capt Talmadge of the Dorian.
I'm glad you're here.

00:58.647 --> 01:02.117
We took shield damage from
the Rekag ships, but we're intact.

01:02.887 --> 01:06.926
Do you have any injuries?
Can we assist you in any way?

01:07.007 --> 01:12.127
No injuries. I'd like to transport
two passengers to your ship.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.166
Of course.

01:14.247 --> 01:17.045
We're conveying
a mediator to Seronia.

01:17.127 --> 01:19.595
He's the reason they fired on us.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.962
Captain, I'm losing you.

01:27.047 --> 01:29.163
Beam your passengers on board.

01:29.247 --> 01:32.284
See to their needs
then escort them to my ready room.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.119
Yes, Captain.

01:34.207 --> 01:37.802
Cancel red alert.
Mr. Worf, take the weapons off line.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.927 --> 01:51.966
- I'm Counsellor Deanna Troi.
- Ambassador Ves Alkar.

01:52.567 --> 01:55.798
And my mother, Sev Maylor.

01:57.007 --> 02:00.204
Counsellor, it's imperative
that I speak to the Captain.

02:00.967 --> 02:03.003
You think he's attracted to you.

02:03.087 --> 02:06.557
But he isn't.
You offer him nothing.

02:06.647 --> 02:10.116
She hasn't been well.
Could she be taken to quarters?

02:10.207 --> 02:14.519
Of course. Chief.
I'll take you to Capt Picard.

02:16.287 --> 02:18.357
Mother, go with her.

02:20.687 --> 02:26.045
Don't pursue him. I won't have it.
I'll stop you.

03:02.327 --> 03:05.399
Space, the final frontier.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.323
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:10.927 --> 03:14.920
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

03:16.127 --> 03:19.403
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

03:20.447 --> 03:24.201
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:20.367 --> 04:24.440
I am grateful for
the Federation's offer to escort me.

04:24.527 --> 04:28.918
But if I arrive on Rekag-Seronia
on board the Enterprise,

04:29.007 --> 04:31.316
the armed flagship of Starfleet,

04:31.407 --> 04:34.763
my mission as negotiator of peace
will be compromised.

04:34.847 --> 04:39.125
There must be a Federation transport
ship somewhere that could take me.

04:39.207 --> 04:41.516
With all due respect.

04:41.607 --> 04:46.158
Admiral, to put the Ambassador
on another unarmed transport

04:46.247 --> 04:48.158
would invite a second assault.

04:48.247 --> 04:51.717
I believe the attack was
an isolated incident, nothing more.

04:51.807 --> 04:53.763
Ambassador Alkar.

04:53.847 --> 04:58.045
The dispute has threatened
Federation ships for many months.

04:58.127 --> 05:00.800
We are grateful that you undertook
this mission

05:00.887 --> 05:02.639
and you have our support.

05:02.727 --> 05:04.126
Thank you, sir.

05:04.207 --> 05:07.517
However, we recognize
that safety is an issue,

05:07.607 --> 05:10.804
not just yours,
but the crew that escorts you.

05:10.887 --> 05:14.846
To send you on an unarmed transport
puts everyone at risk.

05:14.927 --> 05:19.205
I think it best to proceed
to Rekag-Seronia on the Enterprise.

05:20.527 --> 05:22.085
Then I have no choice.

05:22.767 --> 05:27.443
Once you get there, you can conduct
negotiations as you see fit.

05:27.527 --> 05:31.202
Until then you'll be in good hands
with Capt Picard.

05:32.967 --> 05:34.525
I understand, sir.

05:34.607 --> 05:36.962
Good luck
and a successful journey.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.922
- Picard to Riker.
- Yes, sir.

05:46.007 --> 05:49.204
- Set a course for Seronia.
- Aye, sir.

06:19.927 --> 06:21.326
That is all for today.

06:21.407 --> 06:24.922
There will be another class tomorrow
at 0700 hours.

06:28.087 --> 06:32.080
The skills are demanding.
You're very disciplined.

06:32.167 --> 06:35.443
I believe in a strong connection
between body and mind.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.683
You share the same convictions.

06:38.767 --> 06:42.442
Yes, I do,
only sometimes my body has a problem

06:42.527 --> 06:44.358
conforming to my mind's wishes.

06:47.967 --> 06:51.357
I imagine that your self-discipline
helps your work.

06:51.447 --> 06:53.085
I don't know about that.

06:53.167 --> 06:55.840
I think maybe
my biggest asset is patience.

06:57.127 --> 06:59.687
I let everyone talk
until they're exhausted

06:59.767 --> 07:02.918
and when I start,
they're too tired to argue.

07:03.007 --> 07:05.840
You'll need all your patience
in Seronia.

07:05.927 --> 07:08.999
I can't imagine
how you'll get the sides talking.

07:09.087 --> 07:10.486
Neither can I.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.884
I won't know that
until we get there.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.323
I tend to
feel my way through a situation.

07:22.247 --> 07:24.363
Deck nine.

07:24.447 --> 07:28.122
If I were empathic like you,
I'd have a real advantage.

07:28.207 --> 07:30.402
I thought Lumerians were empathic.

07:30.487 --> 07:33.206
Only with each other,
not other species.

07:33.287 --> 07:39.681
So, I don't have any idea
what you might be feeling just now.

07:39.767 --> 07:44.124
Curiosity. What I sense
from you is very unusual.

07:44.207 --> 07:47.165
Calmness, serenity, tranquillity.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.801
You embody the qualities
that you hope to draw out in others.

07:52.527 --> 07:56.964
Tell me, have you ever been involved
in diplomatic negotiations?

07:57.047 --> 07:59.117
Several times with Capt Picard.

07:59.207 --> 08:02.961
There are instances when having
an empath along is helpful.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.925
I'm sure. I could use
some of that help.

08:08.367 --> 08:10.722
Would you come with me to Seronia?

08:10.807 --> 08:13.321
If the Captain authorizes it,
of course.

08:13.407 --> 08:16.444
Good. I hope to see you again.

08:17.527 --> 08:18.880
You're late.

08:19.327 --> 08:22.603
Mother, I told you
that I'd be gone for over an hour.

08:22.687 --> 08:24.837
You're late because of her.

08:25.967 --> 08:27.764
Have you mated with him yet?

08:28.407 --> 08:30.841
- What?
- That's what you want.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.078
Mother. Please, come in.

08:34.567 --> 08:38.879
I can always tell. The ones
with a certain look in their eye.

08:40.006 --> 08:43.443
- I'd better go.
- I'll tell you this.

08:43.527 --> 08:47.600
If you do, you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

08:47.687 --> 08:50.759
Mother, come in, please.
You should lie down.

09:08.687 --> 09:10.200
Come in.

09:10.887 --> 09:14.004
Hi. It's that time again.

09:16.527 --> 09:18.722
The dreaded crew-evaluation reports.

09:19.127 --> 09:20.958
Does it have to be today?

09:21.047 --> 09:23.766
It's not going to be
any easier tomorrow.

09:23.847 --> 09:25.246
It might.

09:27.807 --> 09:29.286
What's wrong?

09:31.087 --> 09:35.558
I've just had a disturbing
encounter with Alkar's mother.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.004
She frightens me.

09:39.087 --> 09:42.397
The feelings
I sense from her are malevolent.

09:42.487 --> 09:44.955
They're out of proportion.
They're evil.

09:46.007 --> 09:50.683
I know she's been sick. She's
very old. She's probably senile.

09:51.807 --> 09:53.798
We could all end up that way.

09:58.727 --> 10:00.524
You're right.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.046
OK.

10:04.127 --> 10:06.846
Let's get through these
and when we're done,

10:06.927 --> 10:10.363
I'm going to reward myself
with two ice-cream sundaes.

10:11.447 --> 10:16.840
First, molecular biology.
Lt Jeffrey Fratis.

10:16.927 --> 10:19.600
- Worf to Cmdr Riker.
- Go ahead.

10:19.687 --> 10:23.885
Can you report to Ambassador Alkar's
quarters? There is an emergency.

10:23.967 --> 10:25.798
We're on our way.

10:29.287 --> 10:30.925
40cc inaprovaline.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.325
I'm sorry, Ambassador.

10:52.367 --> 10:56.121
She was ill. I never should
have brought her along.

10:57.247 --> 11:01.081
She was 93. She'd lived a long life.

11:02.887 --> 11:04.923
I should be grateful for that.

11:05.007 --> 11:07.646
Alkar, is there anything I can do?

11:09.327 --> 11:13.684
Counsellor,
there's a funeral meditation.

11:14.127 --> 11:16.197
Part of our rituals.

11:16.287 --> 11:20.485
As an empath, you're the only person
who could perform it with me.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.239
I'll be glad to help.

11:34.487 --> 11:37.877
This meditation is one
of our most sacred ceremonies.

11:41.647 --> 11:43.524
Hold the stone like this.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.606
Say after me.

11:50.847 --> 11:54.396
- An end to grief.
- An end to grief.

11:54.487 --> 11:58.196
- An end to pain.
- An end to pain.

11:58.287 --> 12:02.838
- Strength comes from love.
- Strength comes from love.

12:02.927 --> 12:05.361
And courage from wisdom.

12:05.447 --> 12:07.961
And courage from wisdom.

12:21.447 --> 12:22.880
Thank you.

12:48.127 --> 12:50.721
Computer,
today's appointment calendar.

12:50.807 --> 12:55.358
0900 hours, counselling session
with Ensign Janeway.

12:55.447 --> 12:57.642
1000 hours, counselling session...

12:57.727 --> 13:01.276
Cancel them.
Cancel everything till after lunch.

13:01.367 --> 13:03.119
Acknowledged.

13:13.607 --> 13:15.199
You wanted to see me?

13:15.287 --> 13:18.324
Yes, Captain.
Sorry, but I'm a little concerned.

13:18.407 --> 13:21.240
I can't determine
the cause of death.

13:21.327 --> 13:24.364
She was elderly.
Alkar said she had been ill.

13:24.447 --> 13:27.007
But I found no evidence
of any disease.

13:27.087 --> 13:29.282
I did find abnormally high levels

13:29.367 --> 13:32.723
of neurotransmitter residue
in her cerebral cortex.

13:32.807 --> 13:34.320
What are you suggesting?

13:35.007 --> 13:37.077
I'd like to do an autopsy.

13:37.167 --> 13:41.365
I've spoken to Alkar and
he informs me that custom forbids it.

13:41.447 --> 13:43.119
Could you speak with him?

13:45.087 --> 13:48.762
You suspect that her death
poses a threat to the Enterprise?

13:49.527 --> 13:51.165
Well...

13:53.647 --> 13:55.000
No.

13:56.687 --> 14:00.646
Then we have no alternative
but to concur with his wishes.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.486
Deanna.

15:33.207 --> 15:34.526
Hello.

15:36.407 --> 15:38.363
Come in, please.

15:41.087 --> 15:45.797
I thought you might like some
company, if you're not too busy.

15:45.887 --> 15:48.196
Nothing that can't wait.

15:48.287 --> 15:51.518
Would you like something to drink?

15:51.607 --> 15:53.040
No.

15:54.047 --> 15:56.561
I'd like you to talk to me.

15:57.127 --> 15:58.958
About?

15:59.047 --> 16:00.446
About you.

16:01.447 --> 16:04.564
I don't know anything about you.

16:04.647 --> 16:06.399
And I'd like to.

16:06.927 --> 16:11.000
There's very little to know.
I lead a very simple life.

16:13.287 --> 16:15.926
What kind of woman
do you find attractive?

16:19.007 --> 16:21.282
Do you find me attractive?

16:22.287 --> 16:24.039
Extremely.

16:25.047 --> 16:28.722
And when you find someone
attractive, what do you usually do?

16:32.087 --> 16:35.796
That depends on a lot of things.

16:37.567 --> 16:40.001
Is it really so complicated?

16:43.887 --> 16:46.037
It can be.

16:46.567 --> 16:50.116
Well,
perhaps you over think things.

16:57.407 --> 16:58.999
Deanna.

17:00.567 --> 17:01.841
Yes?

17:03.407 --> 17:04.964
I'm sorry.

17:05.527 --> 17:07.801
If I led you to believe...

17:10.007 --> 17:11.884
You are very beautiful.

17:13.967 --> 17:18.404
But our relationship
can't be like that.

17:36.367 --> 17:37.959
Deck four.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.841
Sir.

18:08.007 --> 18:08.996
Will...

18:10.207 --> 18:13.119
We were supposed to finish
the evaluation reports.

18:13.207 --> 18:14.879
Of course. Come in.

18:18.887 --> 18:21.401
- Sir.
- As you were.

18:21.487 --> 18:24.684
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir. I was just leaving.

18:24.767 --> 18:27.998
If there's anything else I need,
I know where to find you.

18:28.727 --> 18:30.046
Yes, ma'am.

18:35.167 --> 18:37.476
Are you bothered by his being here?

18:38.527 --> 18:41.758
- Of course not.
- Good. It's none of your business.

18:42.327 --> 18:44.045
I know that.

18:44.727 --> 18:48.356
I believe we were with
Lt Fratis and molecular biology.

18:49.007 --> 18:50.998
Why do I think you're upset?

18:51.087 --> 18:55.638
I don't know. Could we just
continue with the evaluation?

18:56.527 --> 18:59.246
Will,
remember who you're talking to.

18:59.927 --> 19:01.963
You are bothered, I can tell.

19:03.287 --> 19:05.721
Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.155
When you're ready to work,
give me a call.

19:09.247 --> 19:10.646
I will.

19:20.007 --> 19:23.522
Captain's log, stardate 46073.6.

19:23.607 --> 19:26.758
We have arrived
without incident at Rekag-Seronia

19:26.847 --> 19:30.635
where two members of Alkar's
delegation have been waiting.

19:30.727 --> 19:34.845
They have joined us to report
on the situation in the capital city.

19:34.927 --> 19:37.077
Things have deteriorated.

19:37.167 --> 19:40.682
Rekag sympathizers in outlying
districts have attacked towns.

19:40.767 --> 19:43.565
I understood there was a ceasefire.

19:43.647 --> 19:47.435
It was broken. A Rekag shuttle
strayed into Seronian space

19:47.527 --> 19:49.882
and was destroyed by fighter craft.

19:49.967 --> 19:54.518
The Rekags retaliated.
There's been fighting ever since.

19:55.207 --> 19:57.402
If they would just sit down...

19:57.487 --> 20:00.604
The Rekags won't go
into Seronian territory for talks.

20:00.687 --> 20:04.316
The Seronians won't go to Rekag.
In the meantime, they fight.

20:04.407 --> 20:06.637
Ambassador, it sounds so volatile.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.797
Perhaps a cooling-off period?

20:08.887 --> 20:11.242
These people need an end now.

20:11.327 --> 20:16.162
To delay a week, even a few days,
could cost thousands of lives.

20:16.247 --> 20:20.525
Then I recommend that we ask
both sides to meet in Darthen.

20:20.607 --> 20:21.676
Why Darthen?

20:21.767 --> 20:25.157
It is a coastal city
that has been neutral throughout.

20:25.247 --> 20:30.401
Both Seronian and Rekag loyalists
live there. It's a compromise.

20:31.327 --> 20:33.158
Contact their leaders.

20:33.247 --> 20:36.922
If they'll meet me in Darthen,
I'll join them there tomorrow.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.637
I know it must be my imagination.

20:39.727 --> 20:43.606
But it seems as though Lt Pinder
doesn't want me in his section.

20:43.687 --> 20:46.759
- What makes you think that?
- He's so critical.

20:46.847 --> 20:48.405
I can't ever please him,

20:48.487 --> 20:53.083
and I try to make sure there's
nothing he could find fault with.

20:53.167 --> 20:54.759
Give me an example.

20:54.847 --> 20:59.238
Well, yesterday, I ran routine
diagnostics on the sensor pallets.

20:59.327 --> 21:02.239
They checked out,
but Lt Pinder questioned me

21:02.327 --> 21:04.682
because I allowed a 0.023 variance.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.997
That's well within specifications.

21:07.407 --> 21:09.921
He goes out of his way
to criticize me.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.601
Do you know why he might do that?

21:12.687 --> 21:15.440
No. That's why I'm here.

21:16.607 --> 21:20.566
Well, maybe he's just tired
of hearing you complain.

21:21.047 --> 21:25.245
- Pardon me?
- I know I'm certainly tired of it.

21:25.327 --> 21:29.923
How do you think it feels to listen
to someone whine all the time?

21:31.727 --> 21:33.160
I didn't realize I was...

21:33.247 --> 21:35.203
This isn't Starfleet Academy.

21:35.647 --> 21:38.081
You're not going to be coddled.

21:38.167 --> 21:42.160
If you can't take it here,
think about a transport ship.

21:42.247 --> 21:44.283
There's less pressure there.

21:44.367 --> 21:48.076
But I love the Enterprise.
I don't want to be anywhere else.

21:48.447 --> 21:52.042
If you aren't up to it,
you don't deserve to be here.

21:52.127 --> 21:55.324
- Isn't that right?
- I guess so.

21:55.847 --> 22:00.477
You better take a hold of yourself
or be prepared for transfer.

22:01.887 --> 22:04.765
I will, Counsellor. Thank you.

22:09.087 --> 22:10.645
Glad I could help.

22:23.847 --> 22:27.965
Yeah, here we go.
Biofilter log on Sev Maylor.

22:32.647 --> 22:35.764
Geordi, could this log
have been damaged?

22:35.847 --> 22:37.883
I don't think so. Why?

22:38.287 --> 22:40.517
There's a discrepancy between the log

22:40.607 --> 22:43.838
and the tricorder readings
I took three days later.

22:43.927 --> 22:47.442
The tricorder shows
massive physiological deterioration

22:47.527 --> 22:50.485
compared with
when she beamed aboard.

22:50.567 --> 22:53.127
I can't believe that so much damage

22:53.207 --> 22:56.085
could have occurred
in such a short time.

22:56.167 --> 23:00.126
I can run a diagnostic
on the biofilter and your tricorder.

23:00.207 --> 23:03.040
Thanks. The best way
to get information

23:03.127 --> 23:04.958
would be to do an autopsy.

23:15.967 --> 23:17.844
Ambassador.

23:17.927 --> 23:20.566
We've received word
from the delegates.

23:20.647 --> 23:23.241
They'll meet you
in Darthen tomorrow.

23:23.327 --> 23:24.965
Thank you, Commander.

23:32.767 --> 23:35.725
Counsellor Troi
has altered her appearance.

23:37.607 --> 23:39.325
Am I interrupting?

23:39.407 --> 23:41.238
Hello, Counsellor.

23:43.127 --> 23:47.439
You want him, I can tell,
but you have nothing to give him.

23:47.527 --> 23:51.998
- Could I talk to you in private?
- You're envious of him!

23:52.087 --> 23:55.477
You pretend to support him
but you want him to fail.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.637
- That's not so.
- Please.

23:58.647 --> 24:01.684
- Return to your quarters.
- I want to be with you.

24:01.767 --> 24:06.602
Ambassador, the Counsellor and I
are needed on the bridge.

24:07.807 --> 24:09.604
Of course, Commander.

24:19.247 --> 24:23.160
I don't know what you were doing.
You were way out of line.

24:23.247 --> 24:24.726
Deck nine.

24:29.487 --> 24:34.436
Alright, Deanna,
just what the hell is all this?

24:34.527 --> 24:36.006
Anxiety.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.044
Do you still care about me?

24:39.127 --> 24:43.484
Of course I care about you.
I'm worried about you.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.205
What's all this?

24:45.287 --> 24:47.164
Don't you think I'm attractive?

24:48.647 --> 24:50.126
This just isn't you.

24:51.487 --> 24:53.284
It is.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.318
You want me, don't you?

24:58.527 --> 24:59.596
Deanna.

24:59.687 --> 25:01.086
I need you.

25:07.167 --> 25:08.964
What is this?

25:10.967 --> 25:12.366
Please.

25:27.247 --> 25:28.566
Come in.

25:31.487 --> 25:34.206
Deanna,
I'm leaving for the surface.

25:38.567 --> 25:41.877
- You said you'd take me with you.
- I know.

25:43.327 --> 25:44.965
But that's not possible now.

25:45.047 --> 25:48.403
You said I'd be helpful.
You needed me.

25:48.487 --> 25:51.081
I still do. You've done so much.

25:51.407 --> 25:53.762
Then take me. Don't leave me here.

25:57.447 --> 25:59.324
Is Liva going with you?

25:59.407 --> 26:03.844
She's been on Seronia for weeks.
She knows the situation.

26:03.927 --> 26:07.044
She wants to take you away from me.

26:08.007 --> 26:11.124
Deanna, you are my anchor.

26:11.767 --> 26:15.362
I need you more than you realize.
Do you understand?

26:15.447 --> 26:19.281
I need you here,
making it possible for me to work.

26:20.087 --> 26:23.397
I won't let her have you!
I'll stop her.

26:30.007 --> 26:32.646
I will go with you! Take me with you!

26:32.727 --> 26:35.287
Please, Alkar. Don't leave me!

26:36.287 --> 26:38.039
Don't do this!

26:40.687 --> 26:43.121
No!

26:44.487 --> 26:46.557
You wouldn't have recognized her.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.558
Her dress, her hair.

26:49.487 --> 26:51.557
Everything about her was...

26:53.487 --> 26:56.638
I'm closer to Deanna
than I've ever been to anyone.

26:56.727 --> 27:00.766
Last night, she was someone
that I had never seen before.

27:02.007 --> 27:05.602
You don't know what caused her
to behave like that?

27:05.687 --> 27:09.475
No. I've thought about it.
I don't have an answer.

27:10.807 --> 27:14.766
Computer?
Location of Counsellor Troi.

27:14.847 --> 27:17.725
- Deck six, corridor B.
- Let's go.

27:23.287 --> 27:24.436
Ambassador.

27:24.527 --> 27:29.681
I came to alert you that the Rekags
and Seronians disagree about seating.

27:29.767 --> 27:31.166
I'm not surprised.

27:31.247 --> 27:34.683
The good news, however,
is that the ceasefire is holding.

27:35.527 --> 27:39.884
And that is by far
the best news. Thank you, Captain.

27:39.967 --> 27:41.286
Chief.

27:43.167 --> 27:44.759
Will you take me with you?

27:44.847 --> 27:45.757
Deanna!

27:45.847 --> 27:50.318
- Deanna, I already told you...
- I won't let her have you.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.322
Security to transporter room two.

28:03.847 --> 28:06.566
Don't try and stop me!

28:07.967 --> 28:09.798
Let go!

28:10.207 --> 28:13.916
It's nothing. It's superficial.
What happened to Deanna?

28:15.007 --> 28:17.362
All her systems
have elevated readings.

28:17.447 --> 28:21.360
Take her to sickbay.
I want to see you in sickbay, too.

28:21.447 --> 28:25.122
Captain, perhaps
we should delay transporting.

28:25.207 --> 28:28.563
No. You should
proceed with your mission.

28:28.647 --> 28:30.365
- Very well.
- Chief.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.836
Transport them
to the planet surface.

28:35.527 --> 28:38.121
We'll have to sedate her.
20cc melorazine.

28:38.207 --> 28:39.640
Yes, Doctor.

28:42.487 --> 28:46.719
- How's it feeling?
- A little stiff, but it'll be fine.

28:46.807 --> 28:49.605
- It'll disappear in a day.
- Dr Crusher.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.996
I think you should see
these readings.

28:52.087 --> 28:55.966
Her neurotransmitter levels
are 300 percent above normal.

29:00.927 --> 29:04.124
If you remember,
I found extremely high levels

29:04.207 --> 29:07.358
of neurotransmitter residue
in Alkar's mother.

29:08.127 --> 29:10.357
Has Deanna picked up
a disease from her?

29:10.447 --> 29:14.326
I don't know.
I need to do that autopsy.

29:14.407 --> 29:17.285
I don't care about the customs
of Alkar's people.

29:17.367 --> 29:21.724
I need to find out if there's a
connection between Maylor and Troi.

29:24.647 --> 29:27.639
- Picard to Lt Worf.
- Worf here.

29:27.727 --> 29:31.800
Mr. Worf, contact Ambassador Alkar.
I need to speak with him.

29:31.887 --> 29:35.846
Doctor, neural energy
is now 340 percent above normal.

29:35.927 --> 29:39.044
Captain, Ambassador Alkar
is in negotiation

29:39.127 --> 29:40.765
and cannot be disturbed.

29:44.727 --> 29:47.002
Proceed with the autopsy.

29:48.047 --> 29:51.562
Medical log, stardate 46075. 1.

29:51.647 --> 29:54.207
I have performed an autopsy
on Alkar's mother.

29:54.287 --> 29:56.437
Instead of answering our questions,

29:56.527 --> 29:59.724
the results have created
an even deeper mystery.

29:59.807 --> 30:02.162
I don't have any explanation
for this.

30:02.247 --> 30:07.241
When I examined Maylor's body,
her heart, her lungs, her skeleton,

30:07.327 --> 30:11.036
most of the systems in her body,
were 30 years old.

30:11.607 --> 30:14.075
But how? We saw the woman.

30:14.167 --> 30:18.445
That's not all.
I compared Maylor and Alkar's DNA.

30:18.527 --> 30:22.918
I don't know who that woman was,
but she was not his mother.

30:26.367 --> 30:29.200
Deanna's condition
is deteriorating rapidly.

30:29.287 --> 30:33.838
She could die. There are questions
that only Alkar can answer.

30:36.327 --> 30:39.046
- Picard to Lt Worf.
- Worf here.

30:39.127 --> 30:41.800
Meet me in transporter room two.

30:41.887 --> 30:45.118
- We're going to the surface.
- Aye, sir.

30:51.047 --> 30:55.438
- No, she wasn't my mother.
- She wasn't 93 years old.

30:55.527 --> 30:58.883
Captain, did you perform an autopsy
against my wishes?

30:58.967 --> 31:01.037
Yes, for a very good reason.

31:01.127 --> 31:04.005
Counsellor Deanna Troi
is in sickbay, dying.

31:04.087 --> 31:06.237
Dr Crusher doesn't know the cause.

31:06.327 --> 31:08.522
I believe you do.

31:08.607 --> 31:13.556
Alkar, we need you. The Rekags have
withdrawn some of their concessions.

31:13.647 --> 31:16.320
The Seronians are threatening
to break off talks.

31:16.407 --> 31:19.240
- I'll be right there.
- But...

31:22.327 --> 31:25.922
They've been arguing for hours.
It seems hopeless.

31:26.887 --> 31:30.323
But now,
when expectations are lowest,

31:30.407 --> 31:33.399
now is the moment
I can be most effective.

31:33.487 --> 31:37.400
If I'm focused, centred,
free of disquieting thoughts,

31:37.487 --> 31:39.876
I can turn these factions
toward peace.

31:39.967 --> 31:41.798
- Alkar.
- Hear me out, Captain.

31:41.887 --> 31:44.447
It's important you understand.

31:50.127 --> 31:52.402
You see, I discovered long ago

31:52.487 --> 31:55.763
I had the ability
to channel my darker thoughts,

31:55.847 --> 31:59.362
my unwanted emotions to others,
leaving me unencumbered.

32:01.167 --> 32:04.876
Is this what you've been doing
to Counsellor Troi?

32:04.967 --> 32:06.400
I hadn't planned it.

32:06.487 --> 32:09.638
I'd expected Maylor
to live through the negotiation.

32:09.727 --> 32:12.241
Her death
could not have been more untimely.

32:12.327 --> 32:15.205
So then,
you deliberately used Deanna.

32:16.327 --> 32:18.238
She's an empath.

32:18.327 --> 32:21.399
I was certain
I could establish a link with her.

32:21.487 --> 32:24.399
Frankly, I was amazed
at how quickly she'd aged.

32:24.487 --> 32:27.445
Usually, my receptacles
survive for years.

32:27.527 --> 32:28.846
Receptacles?

32:28.927 --> 32:30.679
Come, now, Captain.

32:31.687 --> 32:35.043
Surely you can see
there's a broader canvas here.

32:35.127 --> 32:39.757
If I came to these peace talks
hindered by unwanted emotions,

32:39.847 --> 32:43.283
the Rekags and Seronians
would be condemned to fight.

32:43.367 --> 32:47.360
You cannot explain away
a wantonly immoral act

32:47.447 --> 32:51.838
because you think that it is
connected to some higher purpose.

32:53.207 --> 32:54.845
Captain,

32:54.927 --> 32:59.603
do you know how many have died
on this planet in the last 48 hours?

32:59.687 --> 33:01.564
Thousands.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.207
Deanna Troi is just one individual.

33:04.287 --> 33:06.721
That does not
justify brutalizing her,

33:06.807 --> 33:08.877
nor any others you have used.

33:10.487 --> 33:14.480
Ask the Seronian and Rekag children
in fear of their lives.

33:15.647 --> 33:20.767
Captain, I get no payment.
I have no power base, no agenda.

33:20.847 --> 33:23.998
I am willing to risk my life
simply to help others.

33:24.087 --> 33:27.238
Do you think that makes you
appear courageous?

33:27.327 --> 33:31.445
Because you're mistaken.
You're a coward, Alkar.

33:31.527 --> 33:34.360
You exploit the innocent

33:35.047 --> 33:36.719
because you're unwilling

33:36.807 --> 33:40.766
to shoulder the burdens
of unpleasant emotions.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.923
Well, this time,
you will be held accountable.

33:45.007 --> 33:48.124
I'm taking you to the Enterprise
to release Troi.

33:48.207 --> 33:50.846
I have no intention
of releasing her ever.

33:50.927 --> 33:55.318
Alkar, everything is falling apart.
You have to come now.

33:57.007 --> 33:59.396
- If you'll excuse me, Captain.
- Mr. Worf.

34:04.327 --> 34:05.521
I'm needed.

34:05.607 --> 34:08.565
You and your security chief
will leave.

34:30.286 --> 34:32.277
Lock on to Alkar's signal.

34:32.367 --> 34:35.916
I am sure the Seronians have
reactivated their security field.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.317
Work with Mr. La Forge
to break through it.

34:39.407 --> 34:41.795
- Aye.
- I'll be in sickbay.

34:43.647 --> 34:46.764
If Alkar is flooding her
with psychic waste,

34:46.847 --> 34:49.804
that explains
the high level of neurotransmitters.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.481
All these negative emotions
pouring into her

34:52.567 --> 34:54.717
have caused a chemical response.

34:54.806 --> 34:56.603
Can you counteract it?

34:56.687 --> 35:00.999
Enzymic decontaminants
can reduce neurotransmitters.

35:01.087 --> 35:04.204
But I can't make any headway
unless Alkar stops.

35:04.287 --> 35:06.517
He has no intention of stopping.

35:06.607 --> 35:09.644
He feels justified
in using her until she dies.

35:10.447 --> 35:11.926
Then Deanna has to die.

35:13.687 --> 35:17.919
In order to save Deanna,
Alkar has to break his link with her.

35:18.007 --> 35:21.795
The only way he'll do that
is if she's no longer adequate.

35:21.887 --> 35:25.243
When Maylor died,
Alkar turned immediately to Deanna.

35:26.047 --> 35:28.800
If Deanna dies,
and he breaks the link with her,

35:28.887 --> 35:32.357
he will choose someone else,
possibly from his delegation.

35:32.447 --> 35:35.007
You're talking about killing Deanna!

35:35.087 --> 35:38.796
I can resuscitate her
if it's not more than 30 minutes.

35:38.887 --> 35:41.242
The question is, is that enough time?

35:41.327 --> 35:45.240
Alkar has to link with someone else
before we revive Deanna,

35:45.327 --> 35:47.283
or else he might turn back to her.

35:47.367 --> 35:51.838
We must bear in mind that we'll
be putting his next victim at risk.

35:51.927 --> 35:55.840
I want every security measure
taken to protect that person.

35:58.767 --> 35:59.995
How will you?

36:00.087 --> 36:04.478
I'll give her a hypospray
of dylamadon. It's the gentlest way.

36:04.887 --> 36:06.479
Proceed, Doctor.

36:21.927 --> 36:23.679
Well, my friend,

36:23.767 --> 36:27.521
the era of bloodshed and conflict
appears to be over.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.079
What is it?

36:30.167 --> 36:32.761
I'm fine. Just a little light-headed.

36:32.847 --> 36:35.566
- You're exhausted.
- Do you want a doctor?

36:35.647 --> 36:37.205
No, of course not.

36:37.287 --> 36:40.996
Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar.
Respond, sir.

36:41.087 --> 36:42.440
I'm here, Captain.

36:42.527 --> 36:43.562
Ambassador.

36:43.647 --> 36:47.117
You must return to the Enterprise
immediately. Troi is dying.

36:47.207 --> 36:51.086
We will transport you
whether you come willingly or not.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.522
Security force fields
are protecting us.

36:53.607 --> 36:55.086
They won't any longer.

36:55.167 --> 36:58.239
Transporter room two,
prepare to energize.

36:58.807 --> 37:01.275
We're ready, Captain.

37:12.967 --> 37:14.480
Computer, make a note.

37:14.567 --> 37:18.196
Death occurred at 1430 hours
from respiratory and renal failure.

37:20.207 --> 37:24.120
- Wait for me in my quarters.
- Of course.

37:31.847 --> 37:34.645
It's tragic,
but her death had a purpose.

37:34.727 --> 37:37.924
I'll make certain you answer
for what you have done.

37:38.007 --> 37:42.762
Your own Federation Council promised
me safe passage back to my planet.

37:42.847 --> 37:44.883
I expect you to honour that.

37:58.047 --> 38:00.800
- How long do we have?
- Three minutes, 40 seconds.

38:00.887 --> 38:05.119
Transporter room two. Lock on
to the woman in Alkar's quarters.

38:05.207 --> 38:07.437
We may have to transport her.

38:07.527 --> 38:10.758
Mr. Worf, station yourself
outside her quarters.

38:22.367 --> 38:25.723
She helped me so much.

38:28.407 --> 38:33.197
Without her, I couldn't
have accomplished what I did.

38:33.287 --> 38:38.156
I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

38:42.047 --> 38:43.639
Yes.

38:45.527 --> 38:47.165
There is something.

38:50.007 --> 38:53.477
If we could share
the funeral meditation.

38:56.287 --> 38:59.836
We have a minute and a half.
Prepare the cordrazine.

38:59.927 --> 39:02.395
We'll use that
with the cortical stimulators.

39:02.487 --> 39:03.636
Yes, Doctor.

39:19.327 --> 39:21.522
We can't wait any longer.

39:22.487 --> 39:24.876
- Release the stasis field.
- Doctor.

39:24.967 --> 39:27.083
10cc cordrazine.

39:30.927 --> 39:32.406
Cortical stimulators.

39:39.207 --> 39:40.196
Now.

39:43.287 --> 39:44.720
An end...

39:44.807 --> 39:49.039
- An end to pain.
- An end to pain.

39:50.287 --> 39:51.276
Again.

39:53.807 --> 39:56.321
She has a pulse.
Blood pressure climbing.

39:56.407 --> 39:59.683
90 over 40. Cortical activity
approaching normal.

39:59.767 --> 40:01.962
Neutralize the neurotransmitters.

40:02.047 --> 40:04.356
Initiate decontamination sequence.

40:04.447 --> 40:08.156
Levels are dropping.
Down to 420 percent above normal.

40:10.007 --> 40:11.440
390 percent.

40:12.887 --> 40:14.843
Picard to transporter room three.

40:14.927 --> 40:17.725
Not yet. We won't know
if it's working

40:17.807 --> 40:20.002
till the levels
are below 300 percent.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.560
Alkar.

40:31.727 --> 40:34.287
Alkar, what's wrong?

40:34.407 --> 40:37.365
Neurotransmitter levels
are down to 310 percent.

40:39.287 --> 40:41.517
- 290 percent.
- Now.

40:41.607 --> 40:43.757
Transporter room three, energize.

40:43.847 --> 40:45.075
Let me go!

40:58.927 --> 41:02.806
Neurotransmitter levels
are down to 230 percent.

41:19.007 --> 41:22.795
Worf to Capt Picard.
Ambassador Alkar is dead.

41:37.167 --> 41:38.600
Will...

41:48.567 --> 41:51.639
Beverly thinks Alkar
was at a susceptible point

41:51.727 --> 41:53.206
in the ceremony.

41:53.287 --> 41:55.039
He was vulnerable.

41:55.127 --> 42:00.042
Then the flow of negative emotions
was reversed back to him somehow?

42:00.127 --> 42:03.961
That's our guess, like a man
with no immune system.

42:04.047 --> 42:06.356
- And Liva?
- She seems fine.

42:06.447 --> 42:09.007
He wasn't able to establish a link.

42:10.687 --> 42:13.406
Looking back on the past few days

42:13.487 --> 42:18.515
it's as though I'm looking at a
holodeck projection of someone else.

42:18.607 --> 42:20.643
That's how it seemed to us.

42:22.127 --> 42:24.083
Thanks for sticking by me.

42:25.807 --> 42:27.479
I always will.

42:28.527 --> 42:30.722
Even when you're old and grey.

43:42.487 --> 43:43.476
