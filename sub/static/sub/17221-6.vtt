00:05.539 --> 00:07.308
OH, YEAH, AH, AH.

- WHEN I HEARD, I JUST--
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.836
THE GIRL WHO DRY HUMPED A STATUE
OF THURGOOD MARSHALL.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.573
- YES, I DID,
AND IT WAS THUR-GREAT.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.641
[laughter]

00:40.674 --> 00:42.176

CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.747
I HEAR YOU FINALLY

00:46.780 --> 00:49.750
I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
FOR YOU TO PASS THAT BAR.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.685
- MM, WELL, IF ANYONE KNOWS
HOW HARD IT IS TO PASS A BAR,

00:51.719 --> 00:52.686
IT'S YOU.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.322
GLUG, GLUG, GLUG, GLUG.

00:54.355 --> 00:57.725

ISN'T THIS GREAT?

00:57.758 --> 01:01.395
THE OLD GANG FROM LAW SCHOOL

01:01.429 --> 01:02.396
- TOM...

01:02.430 --> 01:04.298
- DID NOT TELL ME
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE

01:04.332 --> 01:05.299
IN MY COURTROOM TODAY.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.201
- YEAH, OR ME IN YOURS.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.238
- WELL, I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU TWO
LOVE SURPRISES.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.873
NOW, REALLY, IS THIS GONNA BE
A PROBLEM IN THE COURTROOM?

01:12.906 --> 01:13.874
PLEASE SAY YES.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.975
- OF COURSE NOT.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.345
I MEAN, I JUST CAME OVER
'CAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:17.378 --> 01:18.679
THAT I GOT A FAIR TRIAL.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.881
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF JUDGES
ARE OUT THIS WEEK, SO...

01:20.914 --> 01:22.883
[chuckles]
SHORT STRAW.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.252
- YOU'RE SHORT.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.486
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.887
- VERY ON THE NOSE.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.824
MWAH.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.194

01:33.227 --> 01:34.328
- [laughs]
- [groans]

01:34.362 --> 01:36.264
- OH, DANA MCCOY.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.832
- SHE HAS NOT CHANGED A BIT.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.301
SHE'S THE WORST.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.869
- SHE IS, GOD.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.538
BUT I'M SO JEALOUS
YOU HAVE A RIVAL.

01:44.572 --> 01:45.839
WISH I HAD A RIVAL.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.741
I MEAN, MY OIL CHANGE GUY,
HE'S PRETTY MEAN,

01:47.775 --> 01:50.211

[upbeat music]

01:53.247 --> 02:01.255
*

02:04.358 --> 02:06.394
- OKAY, WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

02:06.427 --> 02:07.728
- A BOLT OF PELTS.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.163
- WHAT?

02:09.197 --> 02:10.531
PLEASE TELL ME THAT
THAT'S NOT REAL FUR.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.300
- NO, IT'S FAUX.
- FO SHO?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.634
- FO REAL.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.203
STOPPED BY MY FURRIER
THIS MORNING.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.770
- GOSH, HOW MANY FAKE CATS
GAVE THEIR LIVES

02:16.804 --> 02:17.771
FOR THAT BOLT?

02:17.805 --> 02:18.839
- MM.
- WHAT'S IT FOR?

02:18.872 --> 02:20.274
- I'M MAKING A BARBARIAN OUTFIT.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.375
- WHAT?

02:21.409 --> 02:23.311
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT 30 SECONDS
TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF

02:23.344 --> 02:25.246
BEFORE YOU GET OUT
OF MY OFFICE.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.847
- CONAN-CON.
- WHAT?

02:26.880 --> 02:29.450
- CONAN-CON IS A CONVENTION
THAT HAPPENS DOWNTOWN

02:29.483 --> 02:31.319
WHERE WE CELEBRATE
THE STOIC MAJESTY

02:31.352 --> 02:32.820
OF CONAN THE BARBARIAN.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.222
OKAY, WE DRESS UP,

02:34.255 --> 02:36.324
DRINK MEAD,
WATCH THE MOVIE.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.825
- SO IT'S LIKE
CAVEMAN COMIC-CON?

02:37.858 --> 02:38.892
- FANTASY, THANK YOU.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.328
BUT BASICALLY,

02:40.361 --> 02:41.695
SCHWARZENEGGER'S
GONNA BE THERE THIS YEAR.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.331
- OOH.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.432
- OH, NO, I'M BUSY
THAT NIGHT.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.534
- I DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT NIGHT IT WAS GONNA BE ON.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.336
- YEAH, BUT GENERALLY
FOR THESE TYPES OF INVITATIONS,

02:48.369 --> 02:50.204
I'M BUSY ALL NIGHTS, SO--

02:50.238 --> 02:51.805
- LOOK, REBECCA,
IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.274
IT WAS WRITTEN BY OLIVER STONE,

02:53.307 --> 02:54.475
JOHN MILIUS.
- OOH.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.977
- JAMES EARL JONES
TURNS INTO A SNAKE.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.379
- [gasps]
- JUST TURNS INTO A SNAKE.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.179
IT'S A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.581
- YEAH, WELL,
IF IT'S SO GREAT,

03:00.614 --> 03:01.949
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
BY YOURSELF?

03:01.982 --> 03:03.517
- 'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO HANG
OUT WITH A BUNCH

03:03.551 --> 03:05.286
OF DRUNK WHITE PEOPLE
HOLDING SWORDS--I NEED BACKUP.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.654
- YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO BE YOUR TOKEN WHITE?

03:06.687 --> 03:08.956
- MM-HMM.
- I AM DECLINING POLITELY.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.191
THANK YOU.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.597
MR. TAD LATARDO,

03:16.630 --> 03:20.268
CURRENTLY THE STARTING
QUARTERBACK FOR SOCAL STATE...

03:20.301 --> 03:23.471
- GO BULLDOGS!
[chuckles]

03:23.504 --> 03:25.273
- GOT DRUNK

03:25.306 --> 03:26.740
AND HUNG HIS BARE BUTTOCKS

03:26.774 --> 03:28.642
OUT THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW

03:28.676 --> 03:30.278
OF HIS FRIEND'S CAR.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.812
MS. MAYHEW SAW
THE BUTTOCKS,

03:31.845 --> 03:34.515
FELL, AND SUSTAINED
MINOR INJURIES.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.785
SHE IS SEEKING DAMAGES
IN THE AMOUNT OF...

03:37.818 --> 03:39.920
$3 MILLION?
- YEP.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.422
- TOM, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.356
- I AGREE, REBECCA.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.024
I MOVE FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.459
LET'S THROW
THIS CASE OUT RIGHT NOW.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.727
- DANA, UH...

03:46.760 --> 03:47.761
[clears throat]
MS. MCCOY,

03:47.795 --> 03:49.997
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND I
HAVE SOME HISTORY

03:50.030 --> 03:50.998
OUTSIDE OF THE COURTROOM,

03:51.031 --> 03:52.900
BUT IN MY COURT,

03:52.933 --> 03:55.603
I'D LIKE YOU TO REFER
TO ME AS JUDGE WRIGHT.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.271
OKAY?

03:57.305 --> 03:59.039
MR. BARLOW,
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE

03:59.072 --> 04:00.708
TO SUBSTANTIATE
THESE CLAIMS?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.310
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

04:02.343 --> 04:05.045
MS. MAYHEW CAN NO LONGER
FUNCTION IN SOCIETY.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.947
SINCE THIS INTENTIONAL EXPOSURE,

04:06.980 --> 04:10.384
SHE CAN'T EAT FOOD
THAT'S SERVED ON BUNS,

04:10.418 --> 04:12.353
SHE WON'T GO OUTSIDE
DURING A FULL MOON,

04:12.386 --> 04:14.888
AND SHE LOST
HER CRAFTING BUSINESS

04:14.922 --> 04:19.560
BECAUSE SHE COULD NO LONGER SAY
NOR HEAR THE WORD "BUTTON."

04:19.593 --> 04:20.561
- [gags]
- SORRY.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.795
SO SORRY.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.664
- YOU CAN'T PROVE CAUSATION.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.400
REBECCA--
WRIGHT, COMMA, JUDGE.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.336
THIS CASE IS ABSURD.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.371
A LOT OF JUDGES WOULD HAVE
THROWN THIS CASE OUT ALREADY.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.872
- WELL, I AM NOT
A LOT OF JUDGES.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.742
- I'LL SAY.
APPOINTED BY SCHWARZENEGGER.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.410
- I'M SORRY, WHAT'S THAT?
- OH, NOTHING.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.244
- NO, GO AHEAD
AND SAY IT.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.613
- YOU'RE
A SCHWARZENEGGER APPOINTEE.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.081
- AND?
- MM?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.750
- OKAY, COUNSELOR,
PLEASE APPROACH.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.817
- HMM.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.319
- I'M GONNA JOIN UP HERE.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.321
I WANT TO GET SOME RINGSIDE
SEATS FOR THIS ONE.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.757
- SO GO AHEAD
AND SAY WHAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.493
- OKAY, WELL,
IT'S A WELL-KNOWN FACT

04:52.526 --> 04:53.861
THAT WHEN SCHWARZENEGGER
WAS GOVERNOR,

04:53.894 --> 04:56.797
THE NUMBER OF YOUNG,
ATTRACTIVE FEMALE APPOINTEES,

04:56.830 --> 04:57.965
INCLUDING YOURSELF,

04:57.998 --> 05:00.501
WENT UP ALMOST,
MM, 200%.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.769
I CALL IT THE BREAST LIFT.
[chuckles]

05:01.802 --> 05:04.438
- WELL, UH, IT'S ALSO
A WELL-KNOWN FACT

05:04.472 --> 05:05.873
THAT I GRADUATED
TOP OF OUR CLASS,

05:05.906 --> 05:07.341
AND MY RECORD'S IMPECCABLE.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.377
- AND YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST JUDGE
EVER APPOINTED

05:09.410 --> 05:11.078
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.012
- YEAH, I KNOW.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.747
I USE THAT
IN ALL MY COMMENCEMENT SPEECHES.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.416
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS CHITCHAT,

05:15.449 --> 05:17.885
AND I'M NOT GONNA BUY INTO
THESE UNSUBSTANTIATED RUMORS.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.119
- [imitating Schwarzenegger]
IT'S NOT A RUMOR.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.921
- OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU COMING
DOWN WITH, LIKE, A HEAD COLD?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.623
- NO, IT'S SCHWARZENEGGER,
KINDERGARTEN COP.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.124
- SPOT-ON SCHWARZENEGGER.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.258
THAT WAS--
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.628
- I THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE THAT
OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM

05:27.661 --> 05:29.697
BECAUSE I THINK THESE PEOPLE
DESERVE BETTER, HMM?

05:29.730 --> 05:32.099
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID WHEN
I FOUND OUT YOU WERE A JUDGE.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.133
- GOD, IF YOU WERE ANY TALLER,

05:33.166 --> 05:34.702
I WOULD SLAP YOU
ACROSS THE FACE,

05:34.735 --> 05:36.570
BUT YOU'RE SO SMALL,
I CAN'T REACH YOU.

05:36.604 --> 05:39.707
FYI, SCHWARZENEGGER
DID NOT MAKE ME VALEDICTORIAN,

05:39.740 --> 05:41.442
HE DID NOT HELP ME
PASS THE BAR,

05:41.475 --> 05:42.676
AND HE DID NOT MAKE ME
A STELLAR D.A.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.944
TOM, CALL YOUR WITNESS.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.514
- YES, LET'S DO.
- [whistles]

05:53.086 --> 05:53.487
.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.555
- MS. MAYHEW, COULD YOU DESCRIBE
THE NIGHT IN QUESTION?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.758
- I WAS OUT
FOR EXOTIC SMALL PLATES

05:57.791 --> 05:58.992
WITH MY SCRAPBOOKING GROUP.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.895
WE HAD JUST FINISHED
A VERY INVOLVED SESSION

06:01.929 --> 06:02.930
HELPING ONE OF OUR MEMBERS SCRAP

06:02.963 --> 06:04.765
A FAMILY VACATION TO LEGOLAND,

06:04.798 --> 06:06.066
AND WE NEEDED TO UNWIND.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.801
WE WERE WAITING
TO CROSS THE STREET

06:07.835 --> 06:12.105
WHEN THE DEFENDANT'S CAR
PULLED UP, AND...

06:12.139 --> 06:13.941
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SAY THIS
IN COURT.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.108
- GIVE IT A SHOT.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.777
I'LL PULL YOU BACK
IF YOU GO TOO FAR.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.880
- WELL,
THIS DISGUSTING YOUNG MAN

06:19.913 --> 06:21.482
LEANED OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW

06:21.515 --> 06:23.484
AND YELLED

06:23.517 --> 06:24.718
"YOLO, HOS"

06:24.752 --> 06:26.086
TOWARD MY FRIENDS AND I.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.822
THEN HE PULLED DOWN HIS PANTS

06:28.856 --> 06:31.759
AND HUNG HIS BUTTOCKS AND...

06:31.792 --> 06:33.160
MAYBE A LITTLE EXTRA
OUT THE WINDOW.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.828
- A LITTLE EXTRA?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.864
- YOU KNOW, THE...

06:38.766 --> 06:40.868
THE DRAGON FRUIT.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.702
I WAS SO SHOCKED
BY THE SIGHT OF IT,

06:41.735 --> 06:42.870
I TRIPPED BACKWARDS
OVER THE CURB,

06:42.903 --> 06:44.805
AND I STUMBLED INTO A BUSH,

06:44.838 --> 06:46.840
WHERE I INCURRED
BODILY INJURY.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.942
- DID YOU THINK
IT WAS GOING TO CHASE YOU,

06:48.976 --> 06:49.943
MS. MAYHEW?

06:49.977 --> 06:51.845
- THE PHYSICAL INJURIES HEALED,

06:51.879 --> 06:54.815
BUT PSYCHOLOGICALLY,

06:54.848 --> 06:56.950
THOSE BARE BUTTOCKS
ARE IN MY MIND

06:56.984 --> 06:58.952
UNTIL THE DAY I DIE.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.988
- THANK YOU, MS. MAYHEW.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.990
YOUR WITNESS.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.593
- YOU'VE MENTIONED
THAT THE DEFENDANT'S BUTTOCKS

07:05.626 --> 07:07.828
HAS BEEN BURNED IRREVOCABLY

07:07.861 --> 07:08.829
INTO YOUR MIND.

07:08.862 --> 07:09.830
- YES.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.465
- SO IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME

07:11.499 --> 07:13.634
THAT YOU CAN ACCURATELY DESCRIBE
THE DEFENDANT'S BUTTOCKS.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.102
- YES, I CAN.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.937
- SO NO MOLES,
NO BIRTHMARKS,

07:16.970 --> 07:19.072
NO IDENTIFYING FEATURES
OF ANY KIND?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.674
- NO.
- OKAY.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.175
YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE

07:22.209 --> 07:24.678
WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT
EXHIBIT A,

07:24.712 --> 07:27.247
A PHOTOGRAPH
OF THE DEFENDANT'S BUTTOCKS.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.149
LET THE RECORD SHOW

07:29.182 --> 07:32.853
THE DEFENDANT HAS A TATTOO
ON HIS RIGHT BUTTOCKS.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.922
- BUTTOCK.
IT'S SINGULAR.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.924
- WELL, WHEN IT COMES
TO THAT PART OF THE ANATOMY,

07:36.957 --> 07:37.925
YOU'RE THE EXPERT.

07:37.958 --> 07:38.792
- YEAH, I AM,

07:38.826 --> 07:40.193
'CAUSE I'M LOOKING
AT ONE RIGHT NOW.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.930
- CLEARLY THAT WAS NOT
THE BUTTOCK

07:42.963 --> 07:44.932
YOU SAW.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.634
- SO, UH, MR. LATARDO,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.969
WHAT--WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.003
- IT'S ALEC BALDWIN.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.672
HE'S DOPE.

07:51.705 --> 07:52.840
- AH.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.107
LOOKS A LITTLE MORE
LIKE BILLY BALDWIN.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.609
- WAS HE IN BIO-DOME?

07:55.643 --> 07:56.844
- THAT'S
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BALDWIN.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.546
- THAT'S STEPHEN BALDWIN.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.981
- BILLY BALDWIN
WAS IN BACKDRAFT.

08:01.014 --> 08:04.151
HEY, WHEN YOU SIT DOWN, DOES IT
TURN INTO DANIEL BALDWIN?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.153
- HOMICIDE:
LIFE ON THE STREET.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.187
- [chuckles]

08:07.220 --> 08:08.822
NOW, MR. LATARDO,
I'M ASSUMING

08:08.856 --> 08:10.858
THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH THAT BUTT,

08:10.891 --> 08:12.993
IT DOES BELONG TO YOU, IN FACT.
- YUP.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.262
- I AM TELLING YOU,
THAT TATTOO WASN'T THERE.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.830
- ORDER, MS. MAYHEW,
ORDER.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.667
- THAT MAN
ATTACKED MY EYES

08:19.700 --> 08:20.968
WITH HIS BODY.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.102
HE USED IT AS A WEAPON,

08:22.135 --> 08:23.303
AND YOU DON'T EVEN GET IT.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.972
I WISH I HAD GOTTEN
A REAL JUDGE

08:25.005 --> 08:26.807
INSTEAD OF SOME BIKINI MODEL

08:26.840 --> 08:28.241
WHO GOT THEIR JOB
FROM THE BOTTOM

08:28.275 --> 08:30.010
OF ARNOLD'S HOT TUB.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.044
- MS. MAYHEW--

08:31.078 --> 08:32.613
TOM--
MS. MAYHEW.

08:32.646 --> 08:33.714
FIRST OF ALL--

08:33.747 --> 08:35.048
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

08:35.082 --> 08:36.950
BECAUSE I DO TRY TO DO
WHAT I CAN TO KEEP FIT,

08:36.984 --> 08:37.751
SO YOU KNOW--

08:37.785 --> 08:39.286
BUT I AM A REAL JUDGE,
ALL RIGHT?

08:39.319 --> 08:41.789
I WIELD REAL POWER
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

08:41.822 --> 08:43.056
AND I GET TO DO THIS.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.057
[gavel claps]
- OH.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.560
- BOOM, LUNCH.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.962
MMM, HECTOR, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS ALL MORNING.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.698
I SWEAR, IF YOU WEREN'T PARKED
RIGHT HERE,

08:50.731 --> 08:51.765
I WOULD ISSUE A BENCH WARRANT.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.066
- [chuckles]
OH, MIRA.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.167
ONE MORE THING.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.203
FRESH GUAC.
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.906
- HEY, UM,
HECTOR, I'VE GOT TO ASK.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.142
HOW COME YOU ALWAYS
GIVE ME FREE GUAC?

09:02.175 --> 09:04.878
- AH, I GIVE ALL THE PRETTY
LADIES FREE GUACAMOLE.

09:04.912 --> 09:05.746
- ALL THE PRETTY LADIES?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.280
- YEAH, AND ESPECIALLY
THE REDHEADS.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.349
RAWR!

09:09.382 --> 09:10.918
- I'D LIKE TO PAY FOR IT.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.219
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.021
YEAH, THAT'LL BE--
THAT'LL BE $7.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.889
- STARTING NEXT TIME,
OKAY?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.858
- CONAN THE BARBARIAN FESTIVAL,

09:17.891 --> 09:19.593
DOWNTOWN CONVENTION CENTER,

09:19.627 --> 09:21.228
TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.630
GOT TWO TICKETS.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.631
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

09:23.664 --> 09:24.765
- OH, TWO TICKETS.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.834
NO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO BE A THIRD WHEEL, SO--

09:26.867 --> 09:27.835
HEY, HAVE FUN
WITH YOUR FRIEND.

09:27.868 --> 09:28.836
- NO--

09:28.869 --> 09:29.803
HAVE YOU EVER HAD MEAD?

09:29.837 --> 09:31.705
I'M TALKING, LIKE--
THIS IS GOOD MEAD TOO.

09:31.739 --> 09:32.906
GIRL, IT'LL GET YOU MESSED UP.

09:32.940 --> 09:33.974
- LISTEN, I WISH I COULD,

09:34.007 --> 09:35.676
BUT I HAVE IRONCLAD PLANS.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.210
I'M INTEGRATING MY CATS,

09:37.244 --> 09:38.812
AND TOMORROW NIGHT
IS A CRUCIAL MOMENT.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.314
IT'S--IT'S THEIR FIRST
MUTUAL LITTER BOXING.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.183
[exhales sharply
and murmurs]

09:43.216 --> 09:44.818
- ALL THE MUTTON YOU CAN EAT.

09:44.852 --> 09:45.919
ON ME, HUH?

09:45.953 --> 09:47.354
- TIPPY DOESN'T LIKE ME
TO EAT LAMB.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.623
SHE SAYS IT MAKES ME LETHARGIC.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.025
PLUS, THAT TICKET SHOULD GO
TO A REAL FAN.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.161
- TOM, MUTTON--
IT'S THE MEAT OF WARRIORS.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.629
IT'S A MAGICAL NIGHT.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.930
I MEAN,
THAT I CAN PROMISE YOU.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.766
- I AM NOT GOING.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.267
- OKAY, BUT WHAT IF I SAID--
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.035
MAY I BORROW YOU
FOR JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE?

10:02.069 --> 10:03.804
- ABSOLUTELY, TEDWARD, YOU WAIT
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE.

10:03.837 --> 10:04.905
COME ON, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.874
- MUTTON, OKAY?
REMEMBER MUTTON.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.877
- SIR, HAVE YOU HEARD
OF THE BREAST LIFT?

10:09.910 --> 10:11.311
- YOU BET.
MY WIFE HAD ONE FIVE YEARS AGO.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.412
FANTASTIC.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.613
- NO, NO.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.315
SIR, I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN
SCHWARZENEGGER WAS GOVERNOR,

10:15.348 --> 10:17.885
HE APPOINTED
AN UNUSUALLY HIGH NUMBER

10:17.918 --> 10:19.820
OF ATTRACTIVE WOMEN
TO THE BENCH.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.789
I MEAN, IS THAT TRUE?

10:21.822 --> 10:24.725
- WHO CAN SAY?
TRUTH IS SO SUBJECTIVE.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.126
- YEAH, BUT I MEAN IS IT
SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD?

10:26.159 --> 10:27.828
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.263
ONE HEARS SO MANY THINGS
IN THESE HALLS OF JUSTICE.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.431
- YOU'RE DODGING MY QUESTION.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.933
- ABSOLUTELY NOT--
I'M SO SORRY,

10:32.966 --> 10:34.401
BUT I THINK I LEFT TEDWARD
WAITING FOR ME.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.435
TEDWARD.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.870
TEDWARD?

10:46.446 --> 10:46.847
.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.180
- TEDWARD...

10:48.415 --> 10:51.351
I'M LOOKING AT ALL THE JUDGES
THAT SCHWARZENEGGER APPOINTED.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.253
THEY'RE ALL ATTRACTIVE WOMEN.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.022
LOOK AT THESE WOMEN.
HOT.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.691
HOT. HOT.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.558
SUPER HOT.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.460
- LOOK, I'M SURE
THEY'RE NOT ALL HOTTIES.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.428
LOOK.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.063
OH, LOOK, THEY HIRED HER
FOR HER PERSONALITY.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.132
SCHWARZENEGGER APPOINTEE
RIGHT THERE.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.399
- LINDA SHRIVER.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.101
- OKAY, WELL,
THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.102
- EH.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.771
- JUDGE WRIGHT,
YOUR HONOR,

11:10.804 --> 11:12.405
I'M SO SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.808
MY CLIENT WAS TOTALLY
OUT OF LINE IN THERE.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.343
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE NOT A SEXY JUDGE.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.411
[laughs]
I MEAN YOU ARE, BUT--

11:18.445 --> 11:21.048
OH, I SEE NOW
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.049
IT'S LIKE A VERBAL TRAP.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.250
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

11:23.283 --> 11:24.752
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S REALLY ANY VALIDITY

11:24.785 --> 11:25.652
TO WHAT DANA SAID?

11:25.685 --> 11:26.619
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
THERE IS A THING?

11:26.653 --> 11:29.356
THIS BREAST LIFT THING,
YOU THINK IT'S TRUE?

11:29.389 --> 11:30.457
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.458
- NO, NO.
- THAT'S NOT--MM-MM.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.126
- RIDICULOUS.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.294
BOTH OF YOU...
- MM-HMM.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.462
- I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT ME

11:35.495 --> 11:37.464
AND SAY THE FIRST WORD

11:37.497 --> 11:38.866
THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND.
GO.

11:38.899 --> 11:39.933
- PRETTY.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.401
- CHLAMYDIA.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.402
- WHAT?

11:42.435 --> 11:43.403
- [grunts]

11:43.436 --> 11:44.805
YOU SAID THE FIRST WORD
THAT CAME INTO MY HEAD,

11:44.838 --> 11:45.773
AND THAT WAS THE WORD.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.275
- WHY IS THE FIRST WORD
A VENEREAL DISEASE?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.410
- I CAN'T POSSIBLY
ANSWER THAT.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.512
THE HUMAN MIND
AND ITS WORKINGS

11:52.545 --> 11:54.247
ARE STILL A MYSTERY
TO US ALL.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.248
- MM.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.449
- THAT IS--
THAT IS VERY TRUE.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.350
- LISTEN, TOM.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.787
AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE YOU
SUCKING UP

11:59.820 --> 12:01.421
OR TRUTH TELLING,

12:01.454 --> 12:04.157
I THINK YOU SHOULD PREPARE
YOUR CLIENT FOR THE WORST.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.525
I'M PROBABLY GONNA THROW
THE CASE OUT.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.961
- OH, GOD,
THAT IS GREAT.

12:07.995 --> 12:08.796
THANK YOU.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.463
SHE HAD A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN
AT LUNCH

12:10.497 --> 12:12.499
WHEN SOMEONE BUTTERED
THEIR BUN.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.500
- MM.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.501
- NO MORE PRO BONO WORK.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.302
- ALL RIGHT.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.870
- SEE YOU IN THERE.
- BYE, TOM.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.806
- TEDWARD,

12:18.839 --> 12:20.207
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
TO COME TO TERMS

12:20.240 --> 12:22.776
WITH THE FACT
THAT I WILL NEVER KNOW

12:22.810 --> 12:25.445
WHY SCHWARZENEGGER
APPOINTED ME.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.447
- YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.951
I MEAN, THE ONLY WAY
YOU COULD TALK TO HIM IS IF...

12:30.984 --> 12:32.119
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
[gasps]

12:32.152 --> 12:33.520
- [gasps]

12:33.553 --> 12:35.422
- I COULD ASK HIM.
HE'S GONNA BE AT CONAN-CON.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.456
- YES, HE IS.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.325
- * OH, TEDWARD

12:38.358 --> 12:40.127
- MM-HMM?
- I'M GONNA BE YOUR DATE.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.796
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

12:42.830 --> 12:43.663
- WHAT?

12:43.696 --> 12:45.765
- YOU GO,
YOU GOT TO GO ALL THE WAY.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.236
- FULL REGALIA?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.470
- FULL REGALIA!

12:50.503 --> 12:53.473
[dramatic music]

12:53.506 --> 12:59.913
*

12:59.947 --> 13:01.815
LOOK AT YOU, GIRL.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

13:01.849 --> 13:06.053
- WHO RUNS BARTERTOWN?

13:06.086 --> 13:08.021
- THAT'S THE WRONG MOVIE.
THAT'S MAD MAX.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.890
- OH.
THAT'S NOT THIS?

13:09.923 --> 13:12.059
- NO, BUT YOU LOOK GREAT,
THOUGH.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.060
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.594
- SO DO YOU. I LIKE WHAT YOU DID
WITH THAT SKIRT.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.096
I GUESS I THOUGHT
IN MY MIND,

13:16.129 --> 13:17.564
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE,
YOU KNOW,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.432
SHIRTS-AND-PANTSY,
BUT I LIKE IT.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.434
- YEAH,
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU,

13:21.468 --> 13:22.936
GOING TO THE ATM
BEFORE I GOT HERE

13:22.970 --> 13:24.604
WAS A LITTLE WEIRD,
KIND OF AWKWARD.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.039
- YEAH, WHERE DID YOU PUT
THE MONEY?

13:26.073 --> 13:27.574
- IT'S IN THERE.
- MM.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.043
*

13:30.077 --> 13:32.512
TEDWARD, THIS IS LIKE
A SAD NERD MUSEUM.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.446
AND NOBODY DRESSED UP.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.549
THAT GUY--
THAT GUY HAD A FANNY PACK ON.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.852
COME ON,
THEY'RE NOT VERY BARBARIANY.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.554
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON--
LOOK, LET ME CHECK.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.490
OKAY, LOOK,
IT SAYS HERE

13:43.523 --> 13:46.093

PANELS, COSTUME.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.464

I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.468
LOOK AT ME.
WHERE'S THE MEAD?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.104

LOOK, YOU LOOK GREAT,

13:58.638 --> 14:00.473

14:00.507 --> 14:03.110
WE GOT GRAY HAIR
PONYTAIL BARBARIAN.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.012
WE GOT PARENTS
DRESSING THEIR KIDS UP

14:05.045 --> 14:06.379
LIKE BABY BARBARIANS.
[dog barks]

14:06.413 --> 14:07.580
LOOK AT THOSE WILD DOGS
OVER THERE.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.149
- THOSE ARE POMERANIANS.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.251
THE WILD POMERANIANS
OF ENCINO.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.252
[dog barks]

14:12.285 --> 14:14.154
WHERE IS AHNULD?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.088

14:15.122 --> 14:16.589

WIZARDS, WITCHES,

14:16.623 --> 14:18.091
AND THOSE NOT IN COSTUME,

14:18.125 --> 14:19.960
PLEASE ACCEPT
OUR SINCERE APOLOGY.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.628
WE JUST LEARNED
THAT MR. SCHWARZENEGGER

14:21.661 --> 14:23.596
WILL NOT BE ATTENDING
TONIGHT'S EVENT DUE TO

14:23.630 --> 14:25.999
WE MISREAD HIS RSVP CARD.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.235
BUT MONGOL GENERAL NUMBER THREE

14:28.268 --> 14:30.470
IS STILL IN THE LOBBY
HANDING OUT FREE MUGS OF MEAD.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.940
- WHAT?
MONGOL GENERAL NUMBER THREE?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.441
- WHAT'S HE GONNA DO FOR ME?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.643
UNLESS HE SERVED
UNDER SCHWARZENEGGER.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.411
MAN.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.214
- JUDGE, WHY DOES THIS RUMOR
BOTHER YOU SO MUCH?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.283
- 'CAUSE IT JUST DOES, TEDWARD.
YOU KNOW, IT'S ANNOYING.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.186
IT'S LIKE A FLY
BUZZING AROUND MY HEAD.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.187
[cape tears]

14:47.220 --> 14:48.655
GET OFF MY CAPE, TEDWARD.

14:48.688 --> 14:53.293
- LOOK, I'M IN THAT COURTROOM
WITH YOU EVERY DAY,

14:53.326 --> 14:54.594
AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY
THAT YOU'RE THE BEST JUDGE

14:54.627 --> 14:55.528
I'VE EVER BEEN A BAILIFF FOR.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.530
- HOW MANY JUDGES
HAVE YOU BAILIFFED FOR?

14:57.564 --> 14:58.531
- WELL...

14:58.565 --> 14:59.566
- I'M THE ONLY ONE,
RIGHT?

14:59.599 --> 15:00.767
- YES, MM-HMM.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.603
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GIVE YOU
A QUOTE FROM CONAN, BUT--

15:03.636 --> 15:08.641
- GO RIGHT OVER MY HEAD
LIKE SUBOTAI'S GOD.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.577
- YOU WATCHED THE MOVIE.

15:10.610 --> 15:11.711
- WELL,
FIGURED IF I WAS GONNA BE

15:11.744 --> 15:13.580
AROUND A BUNCH OF DRUNKEN
WHITE PEOPLE WITH SWORDS,

15:13.613 --> 15:14.982
I BETTER KNOW WHAT I'M IN FOR.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.018
- MM-HMM.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.391
- [clears throat]

15:24.424 --> 15:25.392
- [grunting]

15:25.425 --> 15:27.160
- EVERYTHING OKAY,
MR. LATARDO?

15:27.194 --> 15:29.662
- NO, NO PROBLEM AT ALL,
YOUR HONOR.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.264
- WELL, IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU'RE HAVING

15:31.298 --> 15:32.265
A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE THERE.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.566
- OH, YEAH,
I JUST--

15:33.600 --> 15:35.535
I GOT INJURED IN PRACTICE.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.503
- YOU PRACTICE AT NIGHT NOW?

15:36.536 --> 15:37.704
- YUP.

15:37.737 --> 15:38.705
HELMET TO HIP.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.373
IT'S A VIOLENT SPORT.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.543
- SEEMS LIKE YOUR INJURY'S
RIGHT AROUND YOUR ALEC BALDWIN.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.745
- YOUR HONOR, I DON'T SEE
HOW HIS INJURY IS RELEVANT.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.214
- SIT DOWN, COUNSELOR.

15:47.247 --> 15:51.118
I HAVE A THEORY,
MR. LATARDO.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.453
YEAH, I THINK
YOUR ALEC BALDWIN'S NEW.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.555
I THINK YOU GOT IT
FOR YOUR DEFENSE,

15:55.588 --> 15:58.191
AND I THINK
ALEC BALDWIN'S INFECTED.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.459
- NOPE, NEXT WITNESS.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.094
- NO, I CALL THE NEXT WITNESS,

16:01.128 --> 16:06.433
AND I CALL ALEC BALDWIN
TO THE STAND.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.534
MR. LATARDO,
COME ON.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.036
COME ON.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.670
- [shuddering]

16:10.703 --> 16:12.705
OKAY, YEAH,
IT'S A NEW TATTOO,

16:12.739 --> 16:14.641
AND IT'S PRETTY
FRICKIN' INFECTED.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.709
- OKAY, SO JUST TO BE CLEAR,

16:16.743 --> 16:19.746
YOU GOT THIS NEW TATTOO
DURING THESE COURT PROCEEDINGS,

16:19.779 --> 16:21.281
YOU PUT SOMETHING ON IT
TO MAKE IT LOOK OLD

16:21.314 --> 16:22.482
FOR THE EVIDENCE PHOTOS,

16:22.515 --> 16:23.616
AND WHATEVER THAT WAS--

16:23.650 --> 16:24.784
PROBABLY TALCUM POWDER,
I'M GUESSING,

16:24.817 --> 16:25.785
CAUSED THE INFECTION?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.020
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

16:27.054 --> 16:28.688
- BECAUSE I GOT A TATTOO MYSELF.

16:28.721 --> 16:29.822
UPPER RIGHT THIGH.

16:29.856 --> 16:33.060
- OBJECTION--RELEVANCE
AND NAUSEOUSNESS, YOUR HONOR.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.362
- OVERRULED, COUNSELOR.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.630
ANYWAY, I CHANGED MY MIND
HALFWAY THROUGH,

16:37.664 --> 16:38.865
SO I GOT YIN
BUT NO YANG.

16:38.898 --> 16:43.070
SO I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING
ABOUT INFECTIONS IN BAD PLACES.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.804
- YES, WE'RE ALL VERY AWARE
OF THAT.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.439
- ALL RIGHT, COUNSELOR,
APPROACH.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.607
- OH.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.442
YES?

16:49.476 --> 16:50.577
- ONE MORE COMMENT LIKE THAT,

16:50.610 --> 16:52.079
AND I WILL FIND YOU IN CONTEMPT.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.146
- [gasps]

16:53.180 --> 16:55.248
WELL, I FIND IT CONTEMPTIBLE

16:55.282 --> 16:56.549
THAT YOU BRING YOUR SORDID
LITTLE PERSONAL LIFE

16:56.583 --> 16:57.784
INTO THE COURTROOM.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.219
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

16:59.252 --> 17:00.620
I WILL BE FILING
A FORMAL COMPLAINT

17:00.653 --> 17:01.821
WITH THE JUDICIAL BOARD
OF REVIEW,

17:01.854 --> 17:04.391
AND AHNULD ISN'T ON THAT.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.728
- [clears throat]

17:08.761 --> 17:11.631
RECESS WHILE I FIGURE OUT

17:11.664 --> 17:13.366
WHAT I SHOULD DO YOU WITH YOU,
MR. LATARDO.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.368
COURT NEEDS ABOUT TEN MINUTES
TO THINK ABOUT YOUR ASS.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.403
[gavel claps]

17:26.179 --> 17:26.313
.

17:26.346 --> 17:26.779
- PLEASE BE SEATED.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.450
SORRY, MR. LATARDO.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.152
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.686
- OKAY.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.222
MS. MAYHEW,

17:35.255 --> 17:36.523
YOU SAW AN ASS.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.158
I'M SORRY YOU FELL
INTO A BUSH,

17:38.191 --> 17:40.227
BUT YOU DON'T GET $3 MILLION
FOR IT.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.228
YOU DON'T EVEN GET 1.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.696
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOWING
ONE ANOTHER THEIR ASSES

17:43.730 --> 17:45.198
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.134
WE DO IT
BECAUSE IT'S HILARIOUS.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.568
ALL RIGHT?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.837
THROWING THE CASE OUT.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.272
I'M NOT FINISHED.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.440
MR. LATARDO,

17:53.473 --> 17:56.409
YOU TOOK A SMALL THING
AND MADE IT WORSE

17:56.443 --> 17:58.145
BY GETTING THAT TATTOO.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.547
YOU TAMPERED WITH EVIDENCE,
AND YOU LIED TO A JUDGE.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.681
LUCKILY FOR YOU,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.616
I HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE
OF HOW

18:03.650 --> 18:06.453
A TERRIBLE TATTOO
CAN BE ITS OWN FORM

18:06.486 --> 18:07.754
OF PUNISHMENT,

18:07.787 --> 18:09.856
SO I WILL SENTENCE YOU
TO NOTHING MORE.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.327
- GLAD YOU FINALLY DID
YOUR JOB, REBECCA.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.829
- ACTUALLY, DANA,

18:16.863 --> 18:18.198
IF YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB,

18:18.231 --> 18:19.432
YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT YOUR CLIENT

18:19.466 --> 18:20.367
WAS LYING TO YOU,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.169
AND I WARNED YOU
ABOUT CALLING ME REBECCA.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.536
I'M FINDING YOU IN CONTEMPT.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.239
TEDWARD, CUFF HER
AND GET HER OUT OF MY COURTROOM.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.208
- MY PLEASURE.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.243
- I MEAN, REALLY.

18:30.277 --> 18:34.214
- [kisses]

18:34.247 --> 18:36.216
- YOU'RE REALLY KILLING
THE OLD GANG HERE, REBECCA.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.217
YOUR HONOR.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.285
[clears throat]
JUDGE WRIGHT.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.353
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.557
HERE YOU GO, TEDWARD.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.260
TWO SHOTS OF YOUR FAVORITE.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.430
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

18:50.463 --> 18:53.200
- IT'S TWO SHOTS
OF BIRTHDAY CAKE VODKA.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.601
- NO WHIPPED CREAM?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.204
CAN'T DRINK BIRTHDAY CAKE VODKA
WITHOUT WHIPPED CREAM.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.271
- WHAT?

18:58.305 --> 18:59.272
- GIVE ME THOSE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.273
GOTTA DO EVERYTHING.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.841
- WHAT'S NEXT, SPRINKLES?

19:01.874 --> 19:04.811
- HEY, JUDGE,
HOW YOU DOING?

19:04.844 --> 19:07.214
- [sighs] SIR.
- REBECCA.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.283
- NICE TO SEE YOU SLUMMING IT
WITH US PLEBS.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.484
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL BE BRIEF.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.485
MAY I?

19:12.519 --> 19:14.487
- YEAH, PLEASE DO.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.756
- I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

19:16.789 --> 19:19.192
THAT I FEEL A BIT GUILTY
ABOUT HOW OUR CONVERSATION ENDED

19:19.226 --> 19:20.193
THE OTHER DAY
AT THE COURTHOUSE.

19:20.227 --> 19:23.596
- OH, SIR, UM, PLEASE,
THAT'S--

19:23.630 --> 19:25.365
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU,
BUT, UH--

19:25.398 --> 19:27.200
- JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT JUDGES--

19:27.234 --> 19:29.769
REALLY ALL PEOPLE
IN POSITIONS OF POWER--

19:29.802 --> 19:32.672
HAVE MOMENTS WHEN THEY QUESTION
HOW THEY GOT THERE.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.241
YOU MAY WONDER IF YOU ROSE
THROUGH THE RANKS

19:34.274 --> 19:35.608
BECAUSE YOU'RE
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN,

19:35.642 --> 19:37.977
OR YOU...
[sighs]

19:38.010 --> 19:38.811
MAY JUST THINK IT WAS BECAUSE

19:38.845 --> 19:41.714
YOU WERE
JUST ANOTHER MINORITY HIRE.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.250
[clears throat]

19:43.283 --> 19:44.784
AND I'M HERE
IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT

19:44.817 --> 19:47.420
THAT I DON'T LIKE MUCH TO
TELL YOU THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.223
DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU GOT
THE ROBE, REBECCA.

19:50.257 --> 19:53.226
IT JUST MATTERS WHAT YOU DO
WITH IT

19:53.260 --> 19:54.294
ONCE YOU GET THERE.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.763
AND YOU,

19:56.796 --> 19:58.898
YOU DO A GREAT JOB.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.972
- WOW, UH...

20:06.005 --> 20:07.774
THANK YOU, SIR.

20:07.807 --> 20:11.311
I REALLY NEEDED
TO HEAR THAT, AND...

20:11.344 --> 20:13.313
UH, WELL,
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME,

20:13.346 --> 20:15.515
COMING FROM YOU.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.849
- [mutters indistinctly]

20:16.883 --> 20:17.950
[clears throat]

20:17.984 --> 20:20.320
UM, I'M--
I'M GONNA GO TO THE BAR,

20:20.353 --> 20:21.588
AND I'M GONNA GET
A SHOT OF TEQUILA,

20:21.621 --> 20:22.822
AND I'M GONNA DRINK IT.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.591
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE
MY TWO FRENCH BULLDOGS

20:24.624 --> 20:26.426
ON A VERY BRISK HIKE.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.427
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.461
- GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.563
- BYE, JUDGE.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.300
WHAT'D HE WANT?

20:33.333 --> 20:38.371
- HE WANTED TO TELL ME THAT

20:38.405 --> 20:40.039
I'M A GOOD JUDGE.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.040
- REALLY?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.542
- [chuckles]

20:42.575 --> 20:46.279
- I TELL YOU THAT
ALL THE TIME!

20:46.313 --> 20:48.281
ALL THE TIME,
AND I GET NOTHING.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.982
AND THEN BOLO TIE RIDES IN HERE
ON HIS WHITE HORSE,

20:50.016 --> 20:51.951
AND YOU JUST BREAK DOWN
AND START SNIFFLING?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.019
UGH.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.288
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

20:55.322 --> 20:55.955
LOOK--NO, NO.
OH.

20:55.988 --> 20:56.956
- WHAT?

20:56.989 --> 20:58.991
- NO BIRTHDAY CAKE VODKA
FOR YOU.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.328
- UGH.
THAT'S NOT BOOZE EITHER.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.331
THAT'S A KIDS ICE CREAM FLAVOR.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.065
THAT IS NOT A PUNISHMENT
FOR ME.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.500
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.502
- * DON'T BRING ME DOWN

21:09.536 --> 21:11.504
[crowd cheering]
