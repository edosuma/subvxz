WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.660
I guess everybody knows

00:03.660 --> 00:06.140
that Frank was supposed 
 to tell tonight's story,

00:06.140 --> 00:08.180
but we have an unusual situation,

00:08.180 --> 00:10.740
and he's agreed 
 to pass the bag to Eric.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.420
Eric.

00:17.700 --> 00:21.380
My grandfather died this week.

00:23.460 --> 00:25.780
He was from Ireland,

00:25.780 --> 00:30.180
and he used to tell these 
 neat stories from Ardagh.

00:30.180 --> 00:33.060
He'd act out 
 all the different parts,

00:33.060 --> 00:37.060
and he used a new voice 
 for each character.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.460
Um, before he died...

00:40.660 --> 00:43.180
he gave me his hat.

00:43.180 --> 00:46.620
He said, "Eric, my lad, 
 guard it well.

00:46.620 --> 00:50.020
It's blessed with 
 the power of the pixies."

00:50.020 --> 00:51.580
What's a pixie?

00:51.580 --> 00:55.660
Well, they're what Pop-pop 
 used to call fairies.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.980
He said, "Lad, if they always 
 acted fair, I'd call them fairies."

00:59.980 --> 01:01.820
Pop-pop was our kind of guy.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.099
He'd only tell stories 
 about the evil ones.

01:04.099 --> 01:06.340
And he had this great one 
 about Kelpie,

01:06.340 --> 01:10.100
a kind of water horse that 
 invited little kids to hop on its back

01:10.100 --> 01:13.140
so he could swim out 
 into the ocean and eat them.

01:13.140 --> 01:17.220
But I think that Pop-pop's favorite 
 pixies were the leprechauns.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.220
That's where he said 
 he got his hat.

01:19.220 --> 01:21.420
What is a leprechaun?

01:21.660 --> 01:25.340
They're kind of like little old men, 
 and they make shoes,

01:25.340 --> 01:27.340
and they dress all in green,

01:27.340 --> 01:29.580
and they wear strange 
 little hats like this one.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.820
How did your grandfather 
 get the hat?

01:31.820 --> 01:33.420
Well, he said he got it in a trade.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.060
If a person offers 
 a pixie a trade,

01:35.060 --> 01:39.180
they can't refuse, 
 no matter how bad a deal it is.

01:39.180 --> 01:43.300
All you have to do is say, 
 "Mine be yours, and yours be mine."

01:44.900 --> 01:48.540
Anyway, this was one of 
 Pop-pop's favorite stories,

01:48.540 --> 01:52.620
so I'm going to try to tell it 
 the way he did.

01:52.620 --> 01:55.180
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:55.180 --> 01:57.660
I call this story...

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

02:16.260 --> 02:19.500
- [growls] 
 - [boy screams]

02:19.500 --> 02:23.420
Stop that screaming, lad. 
 or I'll eat out your liver.

02:23.420 --> 02:26.260
[screaming]

02:27.700 --> 02:30.140
Now, why would 
 a vile creature like you

02:30.140 --> 02:32.940
pick on a poor boy like this?

02:32.940 --> 02:35.620
Shamus Doyle, 
 you stay out of this.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.820
I've come to take what's mine.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.860
Ha ha ha!

02:43.700 --> 02:47.420
Stand aside, boy. 
 The battle's just begun.

02:51.740 --> 02:52.460
Sorry.

02:56.180 --> 02:58.220
Somebody help me with this wig.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.100
Props.

03:04.180 --> 03:08.580
Well, let's break 
 for the night, everyone.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.700
[man] 
 Good work!

03:09.700 --> 03:13.180
[Eric] Jake Dreiser wanted to be 
 an actor more than anything else.

03:13.180 --> 03:17.100
His big break came when he 
 landed the lead in will o' the wisp--

03:17.100 --> 03:19.220
a magical play about 
 leprechauns and goblins.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.260
It was Jake's first play,

03:21.260 --> 03:23.420
and, unfortunately, 
 it was going to be his last.

03:23.420 --> 03:26.820
Lucy! Lucy!

03:26.820 --> 03:29.220
I need my tea!

03:29.220 --> 03:32.460
I need me tea! Ah!

03:34.260 --> 03:37.660
Just the thing. 
 Just the thing.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.540
- Hey, Lucy. 
 - Mm-hmm.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.740
What's that stuff Erin's 
 always drinking?

03:46.740 --> 03:48.980
Herbal tea. 
 His own recipe.

03:48.980 --> 03:52.260
He says it helps him be creative.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.060
It must work. 
 He's brilliant.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.740
You think that stuff 
 would help me?

03:57.740 --> 04:01.780
- I'm not doing so hot. 
 - I think you're doing just fine, Jakie.

04:06.060 --> 04:09.700
Here's the recipe, 
 but I doubt you'll find the ingredients.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.340
Erin has his own stash, 
 and I don't think he'll share.

04:12.340 --> 04:13.900
Jake!

04:13.900 --> 04:16.820
- Oh, Jake! 
 - Thanks, Lucy.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.740
Good luck.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.740
Jake, me lad.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.300
I feel inspired.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.860
- Let's practice the jig. 
 - Sure.

04:31.940 --> 04:35.780
Look at this place... 
 over 100 years old...

04:35.780 --> 04:38.540
nearly as old as I am.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.220
Shut your eyes.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.700
Feel the magic of the stage, 
 the power of the theater.

04:46.700 --> 04:51.620
Let it transport you 
 into another realm

04:51.620 --> 04:54.460
and make you into a magician.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.380
[man humming]

05:01.340 --> 05:04.820
Take a good long drink, sugar,

05:04.820 --> 05:08.180
so you stay pretty and fresh.

05:10.940 --> 05:13.740
Hello? Anybody here?

05:13.740 --> 05:14.580
[clank]

05:20.220 --> 05:22.140
Whoa.

05:22.140 --> 05:27.220
You're looking at me like I was 
 a sight, but heed me words--

05:27.220 --> 05:30.260
you're the one 
 who has the glamour.

05:30.260 --> 05:32.260
I'm sorry. 
 It's just that...

05:32.260 --> 05:35.220
What do you mean 
 I "have the glamour"?

05:35.220 --> 05:37.660
Nothing at all. 
 Just a feeling.

05:37.660 --> 05:40.180
Sean O'Shaney's the name. 
 Remember it.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.580
You might be needing me.

05:43.820 --> 05:47.020
What is it I can do for you?

05:47.020 --> 05:48.740
Uh... oh, yeah. Yeah.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.180
I'm looking for some special 
 herbs to make tea.

05:51.180 --> 05:54.140
- Do you carry these? 
 - You've come to the right place.

05:54.140 --> 05:56.620
Me herb garden is one of the...

05:56.620 --> 06:00.180
Bluebells, foxgloves, 
 and ragweed!

06:00.180 --> 06:04.180
- How dare you bring this here! 
 - It's just--

06:04.180 --> 06:06.620
You'll not be getting 
 such herbs here.

06:06.620 --> 06:09.180
A pox upon you for asking!

06:09.180 --> 06:12.700
- It's just for tea. 
 - I know what it's for!

06:12.700 --> 06:14.860
Off with you! Off!

06:23.500 --> 06:27.660
[evil laughter]

06:27.940 --> 06:33.820
[man] Take his soul and grind it 
 whole and eat it with a fish.

06:33.820 --> 06:39.260
The boy be mine for all of time-- 
 This is what I wish.

06:39.260 --> 06:42.100
[evil laughter]

06:49.580 --> 06:51.740
Please! 
 Make me a leprechaun!

06:51.740 --> 06:55.060
The goblin can come back 
 any minute.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.940
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes! Hurry!

06:57.940 --> 07:01.540
- You'll never be a boy again. 
 - I don't care!

07:03.660 --> 07:05.620
[music playing]

07:05.620 --> 07:07.780
Then dance with me...

07:08.740 --> 07:11.740
and speak as I speak.

07:12.660 --> 07:15.780
The fairy ring does dance 
 and sing,

07:15.780 --> 07:18.620
the mortal gloom a dying thing.

07:21.780 --> 07:27.460
The fairy ring does dance and sing, 
 the mortal gloom a dying thing.

07:27.460 --> 07:33.940
Now turn me into spirit bright 
 and leave behind the human plight.

07:35.980 --> 07:39.060
[deep voice] 
 Turn me now into a spirit bright

07:39.060 --> 07:42.100
and leave behind the human plight.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.300
What? 
 What's happening?

07:44.300 --> 07:45.740
Keep going on!

07:45.740 --> 07:48.300
Don't stop now. 
 You're onto something.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.980
No! Stop. Stop it!

07:49.980 --> 07:52.700
All right. All right. 
 That's enough.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.420
That's all, everybody. 
 Good day. Good day.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.140
Jake. Jake.

07:57.140 --> 08:01.300
Me lad, you've got 
 to let yourself go.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.700
What's happening to you 
 now is the stuff of genius.

08:04.700 --> 08:08.260
- Trust me. 
 - [normal voice] But my voice changed.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.660
I changed. 
 It was scary.

08:10.660 --> 08:14.140
- It was wonderful. 
 - I don't like it.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.940
Jake, you've got to understand.

08:16.940 --> 08:22.220
When you're making magic up here, 
 it's like you've got the glamour.

08:22.220 --> 08:26.540
- The glamour? 
 - You have the gift, boy.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.620
Use it.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.460
Mr. O'Shaney. It's me.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.700
Go away. 
 You're not welcome here.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.220
Please! 
 I need to know about those herbs.

08:49.220 --> 08:53.100
Aye, I'm sure you do, 
 but I can see through you like crystal.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.740
- Leave me be! 
 - Ow! Please!

08:55.740 --> 08:57.340
Listen to me.

08:57.340 --> 09:00.700
You're taking me for a fool,

09:00.700 --> 09:04.660
and Sean O'Shaney is 
 anything but a fool.

09:04.660 --> 09:07.020
Good day!

09:08.780 --> 09:12.580
But something weird 
 is happening to me.

09:12.580 --> 09:17.260
You saw it. 
 It's like... I'm changing.

09:27.740 --> 09:29.700
What is this place?

09:29.700 --> 09:34.780
I've let you in to say your piece, 
 so get on with it!

09:34.780 --> 09:37.060
OK. I'm in this play.

09:37.060 --> 09:40.780
It's about a leprechaun 
 who saved me from a goblin

09:40.780 --> 09:43.300
by turning me into a leprechaun, too.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.860
Go on.

09:44.860 --> 09:49.180
But it's like the more we rehearse, 
 the stranger I feel,

09:49.180 --> 09:51.700
and last time 
 my voice even changed.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.860
It was scary. 
 Erin said that--

09:53.860 --> 09:56.340
- Erin? 
 - He's the leprechaun.

09:56.660 --> 10:00.300
He told me it was 
 because I had the glamour.

10:00.300 --> 10:04.900
That's what you called it, too. 
 This sounds dumb.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.220
Maybe I'm just nervous 
 about the play.

10:07.220 --> 10:10.980
You really don't know 
 about these herbs, do you?

10:10.980 --> 10:13.300
Just that Erin uses them 
 to make tea.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.140
Oh, he does, does he?

10:16.140 --> 10:21.300
Herbs can be very powerful 
 if used by those who know how...

10:21.300 --> 10:23.660
and if you know how to get them.

10:23.660 --> 10:27.420
- How did you get those? 
 - A trade with a spriggen.

10:27.420 --> 10:32.060
"Yours be mine, and mine be yours" 
 was all it took.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.740
Cost me my favorite toothpick.

10:35.740 --> 10:38.580
"Yours be mine, 
 and mine be yours."

10:38.580 --> 10:40.540
Sounds like a line from our play.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.740
When did you say 
 this play of yours is?

10:43.740 --> 10:45.300
We open tomorrow night.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.940
Last Rehearsal's tomorrow at noon.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.540
Why? 
 You want to come?

10:48.540 --> 10:53.220
I wouldn't miss it 
 for all the suds in Dublin.

11:01.380 --> 11:04.660
Then dance with me...

11:04.660 --> 11:07.620
and speak as I speak.

11:13.260 --> 11:17.220
Ha ha! 
 The fairy ring does dance and sing,

11:17.220 --> 11:19.820
the mortal gloom a dying thing.

11:19.820 --> 11:21.460
Saints and stars!

11:21.460 --> 11:23.860
[Jake] 
 The fairy ring does dance and sing,

11:23.860 --> 11:27.940
the mortal gloom a dying thing.

11:30.460 --> 11:35.100
Turn me now into spirit bright 
 and leave behind the human plight.

11:44.060 --> 11:47.100
[deep voice] 
 Turn me now into a spirit bright

11:47.100 --> 11:49.900
and leave behind the human plight.

11:50.580 --> 11:52.700
[woman] 
 Watch out!

11:53.700 --> 11:58.060
Lucy! Lucy! 
 Who's been mucking with these ropes?

11:58.060 --> 12:00.700
I want everybody, 
 all the actors, to the green!

12:00.700 --> 12:03.500
I'll get to the bottom of this.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.780
Psst! Laddie!

12:12.780 --> 12:15.540
Sean? 
 What are you doing here?

12:15.540 --> 12:17.660
Saving your life, 
 if you don't mind.

12:17.660 --> 12:20.660
- What? 
 - I'm the one who released the rope.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.140
Are you crazy? 
 You nearly killed me!

12:23.140 --> 12:27.220
Lad, you're in danger, 
 it is true, but it's not from me.

12:27.220 --> 12:30.580
Take a deep breath 
 and look at yourself.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.820
[screaming]

12:36.860 --> 12:39.580
- His ears for pointy? 
 - Weird.

12:39.580 --> 12:44.620
- Very weird. 
 - Yeah, and as Pop-pop used to say,

12:44.620 --> 12:49.220
this... is where the plot thickens.

12:51.060 --> 12:53.660
[Sean] 
 I felt it the first time I saw you.

12:53.660 --> 12:57.460
It's the glamour. 
 Every time you take the oath,

12:57.460 --> 12:59.820
you're a step closer 
 to becoming a changeling.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.940
A changeling!

13:00.940 --> 13:03.340
But it's a play. 
 It's not real.

13:03.340 --> 13:06.740
It's as real as those pointy ears.

13:08.100 --> 13:12.380
And tonight you'll take 
 the oath for the final time.

13:13.340 --> 13:17.460
This can't be happening. 
 Erin wouldn't do this to me.

13:17.460 --> 13:22.700
Hmph. He would 
 if he is who I think he is.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.660
Where does this Erin dwell?

13:25.660 --> 13:29.140
His room's downstairs, 
 but no one ever goes there.

13:29.140 --> 13:31.660
He always naps 
 before performances.

13:31.660 --> 13:35.620
What better time to pay him a visit?

13:41.580 --> 13:44.020
[whispering] 
 I don't think he likes visitors.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.820
Then let's be crafty about this.

13:53.540 --> 13:56.300
[Sean] 
 Lucky charms and four-leaf clovers.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.900
What are you doing?

13:59.900 --> 14:04.380
Help me now, lad, and 
 I'll answer all your questions later.

14:06.540 --> 14:09.100
Erin's not going to like this.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.820
[alarm sounding]

14:10.820 --> 14:12.380
Come on!

14:18.620 --> 14:21.460
[muttering]

14:42.420 --> 14:45.900
Just as I suspected.

14:47.580 --> 14:50.660
That's my hat. 
 That's my picture!

14:50.660 --> 14:53.820
Leave it be. 
 He'll know we've been here.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.620
Erin's got s pet toad?

14:56.620 --> 14:59.780
[Sean] That's no toad, lad. 
 It's a changeling.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.380
- [soft banging] 
 - We haven't much time.

15:02.380 --> 15:07.060
Come on! 
 Roundwort, uh, thyme--

15:07.060 --> 15:10.380
- It must be here someplace. 
 - He's coming back!

15:10.380 --> 15:13.060
Foxglove, cowslip... uh...

15:13.060 --> 15:15.420
Ah Got it!

15:15.420 --> 15:18.580
Rowan root. 
 Now we're in business.

15:18.580 --> 15:22.140
- Let's go! 
 - [door creaking]

15:22.140 --> 15:24.100
We're dead!

15:28.460 --> 15:31.100
[muttering]

15:41.660 --> 15:44.220
Heh heh heh heh.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.540
[low moaning]

16:11.380 --> 16:12.220
Ohhh...

16:21.660 --> 16:22.500
Ohhh...

16:35.980 --> 16:41.140
- Erin's a banshee? 
 - Aye. The cruelest of all the pixies.

16:41.140 --> 16:45.620
They drunk the tea of bluebells, 
 foxgloves, and ragweed.

16:45.620 --> 16:49.140
That's why I thought you were 
 the one who wanted the herbs.

16:49.140 --> 16:52.060
Then what does he want with me?

16:52.060 --> 16:53.980
Here where it gets sticky.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.580
They feed on human souls, 
 the banshees do.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.460
Every seven years, 
 they need to devour another one,

17:00.460 --> 17:04.980
leaving some poor creature 
 in its place.

17:04.980 --> 17:08.099
The toad! 
 The toad was a person.

17:08.099 --> 17:09.500
A changeling.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.579
That's the oath you've been 
 taking during the play...

17:12.579 --> 17:15.140
- for real. 
 - Lose this.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.180
I'll call Mom and Dad. 
 They'll get the police.

17:17.180 --> 17:21.900
Take it easy, skipper. 
 The process has already started.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.460
Look at your ears.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.500
You can't survive 
 as half a changeling.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.780
Then what can I do?

17:30.140 --> 17:33.780
You can beat him at his own game.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.500
I won't be taken!

17:47.540 --> 17:51.420
You have my mark!

17:51.660 --> 17:52.410
No!

17:53.500 --> 17:56.060
[evil laughter]

17:58.300 --> 18:01.020
[cheering]

18:04.820 --> 18:06.500
Sean?

18:06.500 --> 18:09.620
Not bad for an opening act.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.220
I thought you forgot.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.980
- Are you ready for the finale? 
 - As ready as I'll ever be.

18:14.980 --> 18:16.660
That's the spirit.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.940
Let's get to work.

18:19.220 --> 18:22.100
There are three rules 
 to beating a banshee.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.700
You must do them all, 
 or the game is lost.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.700
You with me?

18:25.700 --> 18:29.580
- Do I have a choice? 
 - No. Rule number one-- be fearless.

18:29.580 --> 18:31.220
Swallow these.

18:31.220 --> 18:34.060
[Jake] 
 Forget it.

18:34.060 --> 18:37.060
We don't have time, Jake. 
 Fearless!

18:41.500 --> 18:46.020
- Fearless? 
 - Good. Now, where's the bota bag?

18:49.300 --> 18:51.300
Now add these.

18:52.620 --> 19:00.900
Rowan-tree, redthreed, 
 puts the witches to their speed.

19:00.900 --> 19:05.140
Rule number two-- 
 give him a taste of his own medicine.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.220
Don't you drink that yourself.

19:07.220 --> 19:10.020
- Don't worry. 
 - Rule number three--

19:10.020 --> 19:14.460
Don't take your eyes off him. 
 You must spellbind him.

19:14.460 --> 19:18.740
Lock your eyes with his and 
 turn his own spell against him.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.220
Understand?

19:21.100 --> 19:24.660
Then let the angels be with you, lad.

19:32.940 --> 19:39.060
The fairy ring does dance and sing, 
 the mortal gloom a dying thing.

19:40.260 --> 19:44.660
The fairy ring does dance and sing, 
 and the mortal gloom a dying thing.

19:51.860 --> 19:56.980
Turn me now into a spirit bright 
 and leave behind the human plight.

20:01.580 --> 20:05.900
Turn me now into a spirit bright 
 and leave behind the human plight.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.020
Who have you been talking to, boy?

20:10.060 --> 20:12.460
I lost his gaze!

20:13.700 --> 20:17.340
[evil laughter]

20:18.780 --> 20:21.260
You're not afraid, are you?

20:21.260 --> 20:23.420
No! No! I'm fearless!

20:23.420 --> 20:25.940
Do you guys see what I'm seeing?

20:25.940 --> 20:28.580
What is-- did we miss this 
 in rehearsal or something?

20:28.580 --> 20:31.340
[deep voice] 
 You're all mine now.

20:31.340 --> 20:33.540
Help! Help, somebody!

20:33.540 --> 20:35.500
This is really happening!

20:35.500 --> 20:38.980
You're mine forevermore! 
 [evil laughter]

20:38.980 --> 20:41.500
[Sean] 
 Hello, Gort!

20:42.540 --> 20:45.780
Or is it Erin now?

20:45.780 --> 20:48.660
Sean O'Shaney.

20:50.060 --> 20:54.860
Well, you're too late this time.

20:54.860 --> 20:59.140
Gort, still up to your same old tricks.

20:59.140 --> 21:04.260
Because old tricks still work.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.740
Sean?

21:12.740 --> 21:15.300
Hee hee ha ha ha ha!

21:16.380 --> 21:20.940
So you thought the little 
 leprechaun would help you.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.980
Leave me alone.

21:22.980 --> 21:28.420
Seven years I've waited, 
 and now you're mine!

21:28.420 --> 21:29.170
No!

21:38.900 --> 21:42.460
[evil laughter]

21:42.460 --> 21:44.580
You're mine!

21:44.580 --> 21:48.300
Right you are, Gort. 
 He is yours,

21:48.300 --> 21:51.540
and this is mine!

21:51.540 --> 21:52.500
Me tail!

21:54.180 --> 21:58.020
Indeed, but now it's mine.

21:58.020 --> 22:02.500
I've kept it all these years. 
 Care to make a little trade?

22:02.500 --> 22:05.340
- No! 
 - Yes!

22:05.340 --> 22:09.900
Yours be mine, and mine be yours!

22:09.900 --> 22:10.650
No!

22:22.460 --> 22:31.260
Absent friend, distant place, 
 return, return, to the human race.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.860
What happened?

22:35.860 --> 22:39.340
You're free, lad! 
 You beat the banshee!

22:40.460 --> 22:42.700
[applause]

22:43.300 --> 22:45.140
It's not, uh...

22:57.820 --> 23:02.660
- Are you really a leprechaun? 
 - When the need arises.

23:07.340 --> 23:10.820
[Eric] Will o' the wisp was 
 never performed again,

23:10.820 --> 23:13.620
and Erin had disappeared forever.

23:13.620 --> 23:15.660
The End.

23:16.940 --> 23:20.940
And that one, Pop-pop, 
 was for you.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.700
