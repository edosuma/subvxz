She always said she felt like
she was losing something.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.055
At the time...

00:32.090 --> 00:37.090
...I was in middle school, and couldn't
understand what she meant.

00:37.590 --> 00:38.975
But...

00:39.010 --> 00:44.140
...those words had a strange effect on me.

00:51.230 --> 00:52.975
It was before the war...

00:53.010 --> 00:59.110
The big island of Ezo belonged
to another country.

01:18.550 --> 01:23.975
Wow!

01:24.010 --> 01:27.060
A plane?!

01:35.730 --> 01:38.365
Now, those days are long gone.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.850
Our promised place was beyond those clouds.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
KUMO NO MUKOU, YAKUSOKU NO BASHO

01:46.250 --> 01:47.545
In between the oh-so
violent...

01:47.800 --> 01:49.150
[March. Aomori Prefecture, Tsugaru District.]
...fevers and gasping...

01:49.250 --> 01:52.215
...you asked me to get...

01:52.250 --> 01:55.800
...the last bowl-ful of snow,
descended from the skies...

01:55.835 --> 01:59.720
The realm of galaxies and
suns and atmospheres...

01:59.755 --> 02:01.555
Upon two quarry-blocks of granite...

02:01.590 --> 02:03.970
...where the sleet is
lonesomely deposited...

02:04.005 --> 02:07.815
I perched upon them precariously.

02:07.850 --> 02:09.604
And from the glistening pine-boughs...

02:09.639 --> 02:12.315
...filled with cold transparent
beads that maintain...

02:12.350 --> 02:14.735
...the hoar-white, two-phase
equilibria betwixt snow and water,...

02:14.770 --> 02:18.440
- ... at the time, we were drawn by two things.
- I shall take away the last food for my little sister.

02:19.150 --> 02:19.785
How much more time do we have?

02:19.820 --> 02:22.000
We're still okay.
How much more time do we have?

02:31.750 --> 02:32.540
Here you go.

02:32.575 --> 02:33.295
Hot!

02:33.330 --> 02:34.545
Thank you.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.925
When do you want to go to work next, Hiroki?

02:36.960 --> 02:39.960
My club meets tomorrow,
so probably the day after.

02:39.995 --> 02:41.265
What about you, Takuya?

02:41.300 --> 02:43.640
Tomorrow morning is my last practice...

02:44.760 --> 02:46.890
So we'll go the day after tomorrow?

02:46.925 --> 02:48.010
Sounds good.

02:53.560 --> 02:57.730
One was our classmate, Sawatari Sayuri...

02:59.730 --> 03:06.740
The other was the giant tower
across the Tsugaru Strait.

03:17.535 --> 03:20.510
I was always looking up at that tower.

03:21.220 --> 03:27.600
I felt that something very
precious waited there.

03:27.635 --> 03:30.520
I yearned to go there.

03:56.710 --> 03:57.710
One day...

04:16.390 --> 04:17.985
One day...

04:18.019 --> 04:19.769
...I will go there.

04:27.780 --> 04:29.240
Shirakawa-senpai!

04:30.910 --> 04:32.330
We'll go on ahead.

04:32.365 --> 04:34.160
Ah, thanks.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.380
Umm, since you guys are
quitting the club today...

04:39.415 --> 04:41.340
We wanted to give you something.

04:42.090 --> 04:43.655
Go on, Kana-chan.

04:43.690 --> 04:45.220
Hey... wait...

04:47.590 --> 04:49.800
Umm...

04:50.970 --> 04:54.770
So you turned her down? Like always?

04:55.930 --> 04:57.140
Yeah.

05:00.150 --> 05:02.110
That freshman, Matsura...

05:02.145 --> 05:03.575
She's cute.

05:03.610 --> 05:05.190
So go out with her.

05:05.225 --> 05:06.575
What?

05:06.610 --> 05:08.530
If it were you, would you go out with her?

05:08.565 --> 05:10.757
Huh? No... why am I...?

05:10.792 --> 05:12.950
Is there someone you like?

05:12.985 --> 05:14.505
Huh... why?

05:14.540 --> 05:18.160
Well, I think she's cute, but...

05:18.195 --> 05:19.605
To go out with her...

05:19.640 --> 05:22.440
I wouldn't even know what to do...

05:26.000 --> 05:28.200
You weren't the one she confessed to.

05:28.235 --> 05:29.800
You're the one who asked me!

05:42.230 --> 05:42.900
Sawatari!

06:03.080 --> 06:03.920
Fujisawa-kun!

06:04.590 --> 06:06.265
Sawatari...

06:06.300 --> 06:07.925
You're going home pretty late.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.260
Yeah. It got late while I was practicing.

06:11.295 --> 06:12.300
The violin?

06:12.335 --> 06:13.815
Yeah.

06:13.850 --> 06:16.560
You aren't with Shirakawa-kun today?

06:16.595 --> 06:19.525
No, I went to my club today.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.900
I see you practicing archery by
yourself once in a while, Fujisawa-kun.

06:23.310 --> 06:24.575
Y- Yeah...

06:24.610 --> 06:27.900
I'm not very good.
I can't really seem to concentrate well.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.280
What are you going to do over
spring break, Fujisawa-kun?

06:36.460 --> 06:37.180
Well...

06:37.200 --> 06:39.210
Takuya and I are going to work.

06:39.245 --> 06:41.975
Work? That's good. Where?

06:42.010 --> 06:44.110
At a military factory in Hamana.

06:44.145 --> 06:46.175
We put guided missiles together.

06:46.210 --> 06:49.650
I see. It's really great that you work.

06:49.685 --> 06:53.090
I'm probably still going to go to my club.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.112
I see.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.100
Yeah.

07:07.350 --> 07:09.750
Next Stop, Nakaoguni, Nakaoguni.

07:09.785 --> 07:12.150
Following Nakaoguni is Oodaria.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.700
We're almost at my stop.

07:14.780 --> 07:16.875
You know, yesterday...

07:16.910 --> 07:20.040
...I dreamt of going home
with you like this.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.160
Bye bye. See you next term.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.170
Y- Yeah...

07:59.360 --> 08:02.745
Starting the 12th and spanning
a period of three days...

08:02.780 --> 08:06.375
...the 11th conference between the United
States and the Union will take place.

08:06.410 --> 08:10.910
They are expected to discuss the increasing
tensions between Japan's North-South divide.

08:10.945 --> 08:15.870
While the Union is opposed to the reinforcement
of the military base at Misawa...

08:15.905 --> 08:20.590
...the American government is uneasy
about the Union's unwillingness...

08:20.625 --> 08:22.765
...to announce the purpose...

08:22.800 --> 08:24.105
- ...of the giant tower at Ezo.
- Hello.

08:24.140 --> 08:25.975
Good, you're on break.

08:26.010 --> 08:27.810
Yeah, come sit down.

08:27.845 --> 08:29.075
Sure.

08:29.110 --> 08:30.110
You're late, Hiroki.

08:30.145 --> 08:31.165
Sorry.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.825
We heard the news, Hiroki.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.900
You guys stole a marine Chukar?

08:35.934 --> 08:36.284
I told you...

08:36.320 --> 08:37.860
...that's not true!

08:37.895 --> 08:39.365
We didn't steal it!

08:39.400 --> 08:41.510
We found it in the forest!

08:41.544 --> 08:43.585
So you guys did steal it.

08:43.620 --> 08:47.170
Well, you'll be okay since they've been
sending out a lot of drones for practice.

08:47.205 --> 08:50.000
Make sure you guys don't get caught.

08:50.035 --> 08:51.235
Yeah.

08:51.270 --> 08:54.380
This place is always under
government supervision.

08:56.340 --> 08:59.220
Don't say that kind of stuff.

08:59.510 --> 09:01.055
Get to work.

09:01.090 --> 09:02.185
Yes, sir.

09:02.220 --> 09:03.700
Later.

09:03.735 --> 09:05.145
Yeah.

09:05.180 --> 09:08.025
You guys come in tomorrow
and start working, too.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.900
I'll make you work harder than
you've ever worked before.

09:10.935 --> 09:12.062
Yes, sir.

09:12.097 --> 09:13.155
Okay, then...

09:13.190 --> 09:14.230
We'll see you tomorrow.

09:14.265 --> 09:15.110
Yeah.

09:16.740 --> 09:20.280
There was a reason we started working.

09:21.070 --> 09:23.500
When Ezo was still called Hokkaido,

09:23.750 --> 09:29.710
they planned to dig a tunnel
under the Tsugaru Strait.

09:30.570 --> 09:35.515
The plan was cancelled after the
North-South divide took place, but...

09:35.550 --> 09:42.140
...there are still abandoned factories,
stations, and rails all over these hills.

09:43.050 --> 09:47.000
We were going to one of those abandoned
stations at the top of the mountain...

09:47.250 --> 09:49.730
...to make something we had
wanted since last year.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.250
We worked at the Emishi
Manufacturing military factory...

09:54.500 --> 09:56.780
...to make money to buy parts.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.675
It was almost close enough to touch...

10:00.710 --> 10:03.320
...but we still couldn't go there.

10:04.530 --> 10:12.500
We both needed to see the island and the
giant tower with our own two eyes.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.130
The snow's almost all melted.
I want to get started again.

10:21.630 --> 10:24.490
As long as it's done snowing, we'll be okay.

10:24.525 --> 10:27.315
We have to get all of our parts ready, too.

10:27.350 --> 10:31.955
We still need the nanonet for
the exterior and the cell motor.

10:31.990 --> 10:35.990
We'll also need a big electric motor
and some kerosene later.

10:36.025 --> 10:39.990
What we make this week probably
won't be enough for that.

10:40.025 --> 10:43.200
We'll make it.
We still have summer break, too.

10:43.235 --> 10:44.240
That's right.

10:46.370 --> 10:55.000
We named the plane Velaciela, and we were
going to go to that tower across the border.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.180
[4 Months Later. Early Summer.]
The same dream again...

12:03.490 --> 12:04.070
Sawatari?

12:06.660 --> 12:07.820
Takuya-kun.

12:25.010 --> 12:25.840
Hey...
Hey...

12:26.550 --> 12:27.550
Sorry.

12:27.585 --> 12:28.550
No, no.

12:32.770 --> 12:33.850
Hiroki said...
Hiroki said...

12:40.020 --> 12:44.860
We've never really spoken
to each other, have we?

12:45.400 --> 12:46.860
You might be right.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.660
Do you like physics, Takuya-kun?

12:51.490 --> 12:55.120
Oh, this book? I'm kind of
interested in this stuff.

12:55.155 --> 12:56.465
That's great.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.650
My grandfather was a physicist.

12:59.685 --> 13:02.677
Wow, that's better than me.

13:02.712 --> 13:04.901
I never met him, though.

13:04.936 --> 13:07.090
The North-South divide?

13:07.125 --> 13:08.107
Yeah.

13:08.142 --> 13:09.090
I see.

13:12.850 --> 13:16.600
So, you guys are still working, right?

13:16.635 --> 13:17.735
Is it fun?

13:17.770 --> 13:19.195
I don't know about that...

13:19.230 --> 13:23.610
There's a scary guy working at the factory
who yells at us and treats us like slaves.

13:23.645 --> 13:25.205
Is he that scary?

13:25.240 --> 13:26.610
He's like the demon from Nebuta.

13:26.645 --> 13:27.745
Really?

13:27.780 --> 13:29.110
You want to see?

13:29.145 --> 13:30.085
Heh?

13:30.120 --> 13:32.295
But won't I bother you guys?

13:32.330 --> 13:34.740
No, Hiroki will probably be happy, too.

13:34.775 --> 13:36.365
Yeah, I'll go!

13:36.400 --> 13:40.280
The train for the Kanita - Minmaya line
will arrive on the second line shortly.

13:40.315 --> 13:43.410
Please wait behind the white line.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.970
Hey, Takuya-kun...

13:48.340 --> 13:52.260
This might sound weird, but...
do you promise not to laugh?

13:52.295 --> 13:54.177
What is it? I won't laugh.

13:54.212 --> 13:56.060
Then I'll tell you. It's...

14:13.910 --> 14:16.910
Hey, why'd you invite her?

14:16.945 --> 14:19.910
Sorry. It just slipped out.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.855
What do you want to do?

14:31.890 --> 14:33.930
You want to tell her about our
plan to fly to the tower?

14:33.965 --> 14:35.810
No, that would be bad.

14:36.430 --> 14:40.570
Yeah... but what if she asks
where we're going with it?

14:40.605 --> 14:41.700
Hmm...

14:43.860 --> 14:45.070
Hey...

14:46.070 --> 14:47.360
Yeah?

15:00.150 --> 15:01.845
Hello.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.710
Hey. It's hot today, isn't it?

15:03.745 --> 15:05.540
Hello. Sorry for interrupting.

15:05.575 --> 15:07.095
Ah... sorry!

15:07.130 --> 15:11.720
So you're a friend of my two idiots?

15:19.340 --> 15:22.525
Is Okabe-san single?

15:22.560 --> 15:25.560
No, I heard he was divorced.

15:25.595 --> 15:28.940
I think I can see why.

15:34.020 --> 15:37.700
What a beautiful place! It's so open!

15:50.090 --> 15:51.635
Wow!

15:51.670 --> 15:53.145
A plane?

15:53.180 --> 15:54.180
That's right.

15:55.530 --> 15:58.385
Are the two of you building
this by yourselves?

15:58.420 --> 16:01.820
Yeah, we've been slowly working
on it since junior year.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.290
We work at the factory to get parts...

16:04.325 --> 16:06.560
...and to ask advice from Okabe-san.

16:06.595 --> 16:07.517
Right?

16:07.552 --> 16:08.405
Yeah.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.650
But it's still not finished.

16:10.685 --> 16:13.115
It's incredible.

16:13.150 --> 16:15.700
Hey, it's really great!

16:16.820 --> 16:19.330
T- Thanks...

16:44.100 --> 16:44.695
Hey...

16:44.730 --> 16:48.150
When do you think the plane
is going to be finished?

16:48.185 --> 16:52.042
Well, we want to finish it
during summer break, but...

16:52.077 --> 16:55.900
We probably won't.
A lot of work still needs to get done.

16:55.935 --> 16:58.490
The end of the year might
be a more realistic goal.

16:58.525 --> 16:59.665
I see.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.700
Where are you guys going with that plane?

17:04.700 --> 17:06.710
We're going to that tower.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.175
By tower...

17:11.210 --> 17:12.170
...you mean the Union's tower?

17:15.339 --> 17:15.670
Yeah.

17:16.170 --> 17:19.089
We think we can get to the
tower in about forty minutes.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.010
We just need to figure out how
to get across the border.

17:22.045 --> 17:23.984
But we're working on that.

17:24.020 --> 17:27.140
Wow, wow! I want to go to Hokkaido.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.060
You want to come, Sawatari?

17:31.270 --> 17:31.940
Really?

17:32.190 --> 17:33.235
Yeah.

17:33.270 --> 17:36.110
Really? Yeah, I want to go!

17:36.900 --> 17:38.535
Thanks!

17:38.570 --> 17:41.030
But we really don't know if it'll fly yet.

17:41.065 --> 17:43.030
Don't worry, it'll fly!

17:43.065 --> 17:43.915
Yeah.

17:43.950 --> 17:46.120
So let's promise!

17:46.155 --> 17:47.585
Yeah.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.620
Then, it's a promise.

17:49.655 --> 17:50.580
Yeah!

17:57.760 --> 18:04.350
Back then, I felt that this place...
this time would last forever.

18:05.470 --> 18:08.500
The tower I admired that lay beyond the
clouds...

18:08.750 --> 18:12.610
...became the place of a precious promise.

18:13.570 --> 18:19.740
At that moment, we weren't
afraid of anything.

18:21.910 --> 18:27.450
But in reality, the world and the flow
of time kept on going all around me.

18:28.710 --> 18:32.850
Yet I couldn't help but feel that
the nighttime smell in the train,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.090
my friend's trust...

18:35.125 --> 18:40.680
...and the presence of Sayuri were
the only things in this world.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.660
Between last night and this morning...

18:47.670 --> 18:48.975
...in the DMZ between
the coast of Tsugaru...

18:49.010 --> 18:51.975
...and the 42nd parallel,
a short skirmish broke out...

18:52.010 --> 18:55.680
...between the Japanese/American
and the Union Armed Forces.

18:56.430 --> 18:57.650
As a result, the chief of police,...

18:57.800 --> 19:00.750
...anticipating backlash from
national Uilta and terrorist groups...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.450
...has dispatched a force
of 3300 peacekeepers...

19:03.600 --> 19:07.200
...to the Union embassy as a
precautionary measure.

19:07.350 --> 19:08.600
Yeah.

19:11.700 --> 19:16.210
Of course I'll sell you kerosene and
anything else, if you pay for it...

19:16.880 --> 19:19.260
...but jet fuel is expensive.

19:20.180 --> 19:24.220
Why don't you guys just use a
reciprocating or large electric motor?

19:27.060 --> 19:28.770
You know how to do the rest?

19:28.840 --> 19:29.435
Yes.

19:29.470 --> 19:30.730
Get to it.

19:43.660 --> 19:47.740
Why do you guys want to
use a jet engine, anyway?

19:47.775 --> 19:49.262
Because it looks cool!

19:49.297 --> 19:50.715
Is that the only reason?

19:50.750 --> 19:54.000
Wait a second... there were other reasons.

19:54.035 --> 19:55.750
Umm... oh, I know!

19:56.170 --> 19:57.500
Because we were lucky enough to find it!

19:57.535 --> 19:58.750
That's not it!

19:59.090 --> 20:01.710
What was it... there was a reason we
decided on two different engines...

20:01.745 --> 20:03.800
There was a good reason behind it.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.355
Oh, I know.

20:05.390 --> 20:07.285
We want it to transform!

20:07.320 --> 20:09.180
That's not it either!

20:09.930 --> 20:11.695
I don't really care.

20:11.730 --> 20:15.695
Just don't die...
I don't want it to get messy.

20:15.730 --> 20:19.400
Hey, you guys should come to work every
day once summer vacation starts.

20:19.435 --> 20:19.730
Yes, sir.

20:23.190 --> 20:24.285
Hey...

20:24.320 --> 20:26.365
Do I really have to play?

20:26.400 --> 20:28.410
Yeah, we'll go after school.

20:30.790 --> 20:33.910
I'm not really good.

20:34.540 --> 20:35.545
That's okay.

20:35.580 --> 20:37.880
I've never seen anyone play before.

20:37.915 --> 20:39.555
Play for me?

20:39.590 --> 20:41.250
I'd like to hear you play, too.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.670
I'm getting nervous...

21:47.610 --> 21:50.995
The nanonet won't reflect
radar waves, right?

21:51.030 --> 21:53.780
But we are going to fly through
a military no-fly zone.

21:53.870 --> 21:57.250
We have to do it right, or we might
get caught by the Americans...

21:57.500 --> 21:59.870
...before the Union even sees us.

22:01.380 --> 22:04.380
I guess we'll just have to fly really low.

22:04.415 --> 22:07.345
Try to blend in with the
waves and landforms.

22:07.380 --> 22:09.380
If we leave early in the morning, we could
probably hide in the morning fog.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.475
Do you have a map of Ezo?

22:11.510 --> 22:13.895
This is the only one with any real detail.

22:13.930 --> 22:16.185
We won't know the lay of
the land till we get there.

22:16.220 --> 22:19.560
So once we land, we'll have
to figure out our elevation.

22:19.595 --> 22:22.832
But if we land, we shouldn't
show up on the Union's radar.

22:22.867 --> 22:26.070
Velaciela should look smaller
than a little bird on the radar.

22:26.105 --> 22:29.000
Probably, but if we run
into some bad luck...

24:01.450 --> 24:01.830
Sawatari!

24:06.920 --> 24:07.840
Hang on!

24:13.220 --> 24:16.470
It's okay... it's not that far down...

24:22.980 --> 24:25.850
Have we... done this before?

24:29.860 --> 24:32.600
Thank God, I made it in time. I'll-

24:49.290 --> 24:50.340
Are you guys okay?

24:51.380 --> 24:52.670
Yeah.

24:52.760 --> 24:52.880
Sorry.

24:53.880 --> 24:54.840
Thanks.

24:56.380 --> 24:57.590
Hey!

25:00.470 --> 25:01.930
That surprised him!

25:02.560 --> 25:03.890
What did you do that for?!

25:04.650 --> 25:06.230
Stop it, Hiroki!

25:07.270 --> 25:08.480
Sorry, it was just too tempting.

25:08.515 --> 25:09.730
What?

25:10.650 --> 25:13.570
What are you trying to do?

25:13.605 --> 25:15.232
Don't get so angry.

25:15.267 --> 25:16.825
Of course I'm angry!

25:16.860 --> 25:18.820
Stay in the water forever!

25:18.855 --> 25:20.780
Let's go, Sawatari.

25:20.815 --> 25:22.205
Takuya!

25:22.240 --> 25:24.830
Sawatari, say something to him.

25:24.865 --> 25:26.722
Sorry, Takuya-kun.

25:26.757 --> 25:28.580
Hiroki's an idiot.

25:28.615 --> 25:29.885
Let's go.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.590
Hey, Takuya...

25:44.480 --> 25:49.400
Earlier, I was in a dream
for a brief moment.

25:49.435 --> 25:52.150
A dream? What kind of dream?

25:53.940 --> 25:59.070
I forget... but it was
probably about that tower.

25:59.105 --> 26:01.780
The scenery here is pretty dreamlike.

26:01.815 --> 26:04.005
The Union is amazing.

26:04.040 --> 26:08.370
It seems like the tower is
connected to another world.

26:23.850 --> 26:28.180
The sun... is taking its time setting.

26:30.310 --> 26:34.985
That was a really special summer.

26:35.020 --> 26:40.910
But the world around me would
betray me again and again after this.

26:42.370 --> 26:48.250
Since that day three years ago,
I haven't seen Sawatari once.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.365
[3 Years Later]

26:57.400 --> 26:59.100
[Union Territory - Ezo Airspace]

27:11.340 --> 27:12.845
[Fall. Aomori City.]

27:12.880 --> 27:15.960
[American NSA - Aomori Army
College Wartime Special Information
Processing Room.]

27:35.670 --> 27:38.130
We have some guests, but don't worry.

27:38.165 --> 27:40.590
First phase complete. Let's continue.

27:40.625 --> 27:41.300
Okay.

27:42.180 --> 27:43.590
Next, the filtration stage.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.645
Starting second phase.

27:45.680 --> 27:49.180
We have a 25% increase in the
resolution power to reach our target.

27:49.215 --> 27:52.020
Good, maybe we can make it this time.

27:52.055 --> 27:54.060
Pick your algorithms wisely.

27:54.095 --> 27:55.060
Yes, sir.

27:55.690 --> 27:57.285
Which algorithm, Shirakawa?

27:57.320 --> 27:59.820
I put a lot of work into the
group extraction filtering.

27:59.855 --> 28:01.650
I got it from a paper by Ekusun Tsukinoe.

28:01.685 --> 28:03.200
You mean the Ekusun Tsukinoe from...

28:03.235 --> 28:04.217
...the Union?

28:04.252 --> 28:05.165
That's right.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.745
What? How'd you manage th-

28:06.780 --> 28:09.150
Wait! Getting increased readings...

28:09.185 --> 28:10.795
Who's Ekusun Tsukinoe?

28:10.830 --> 28:12.500
He's a Union researcher
who was the first person...

28:12.750 --> 28:14.830
...to prove the existence
of parallel universes.

28:14.865 --> 28:16.580
He's thought to be the one
who designed that tower.

28:16.615 --> 28:17.675
Got it!

28:17.710 --> 28:21.300
I'm getting exposure readings
from the direction of XA YC ZC.

28:21.335 --> 28:24.220
It-shows five... no,
six diverging universes.

28:24.255 --> 28:26.550
Six? Begin the tune-in stage.

28:26.585 --> 28:27.975
Connect to it!

28:28.010 --> 28:30.295
Starting third phase.

28:30.330 --> 28:33.740
Connect to the closest parallel world.

28:33.775 --> 28:34.800
Yes, sir.

28:40.570 --> 28:41.740
He's fast.

28:42.570 --> 28:44.905
Shirakawa-kun is the closest one.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.240
Connection is possible in 12 exa.

28:47.275 --> 28:51.240
11... 10... 9.4... 9.2...

28:52.250 --> 28:53.620
I've connected!

28:54.080 --> 28:56.585
I've connected to one of the worlds.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.055
My exposure readings are steady.

28:59.090 --> 29:01.500
Let's move on to the transformation stage.

29:02.210 --> 29:03.225
Fourth phase.

29:03.260 --> 29:05.680
Replace space with the parallel world.

29:14.730 --> 29:18.860
Transformation of space with a radius
of 60 nm confirmed. Spreading quickly.

29:18.895 --> 29:21.115
It'll be visible to the naked
eye in a few moments.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.470
We can't do it.

29:47.180 --> 29:47.985
We can't do it.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.455
Exposure readings falling.

29:49.490 --> 29:52.470
We can't maintain our connection
to the world much longer.

30:02.650 --> 30:04.075
Wave function is converging.

30:04.110 --> 30:06.455
We've lost the connection
to the divergent world.

30:06.490 --> 30:10.280
We were able to switch a 1.3 mm
radius area with the other world.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.000
Good work.

30:21.500 --> 30:24.690
Doctor Tomisawa, is Shirakawa-kun free now?

30:24.725 --> 30:27.845
Yeah, he's free. You guys
are always together.

30:27.880 --> 30:32.510
You were the one who told me to stay
with him until he got used to it here.

30:32.545 --> 30:33.105
Did I?

30:33.140 --> 30:35.810
Oh yeah, Maki-chan, I'm going
to Tokyo tomorrow for work.

30:35.845 --> 30:37.735
You're going to report your findings, right?

30:37.770 --> 30:42.650
There's that too, but we think we've
found the key we were looking for.

30:42.685 --> 30:44.520
You mean the one you were
talking about a while ago?

30:44.555 --> 30:45.445
Yeah.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.740
Your cerebral science team
might get some work soon.

30:50.780 --> 30:51.780
Maki-san.

31:00.210 --> 31:02.625
A lot of soldiers have
been coming in lately.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.040
The guy in the suit is
probably from the NSA.

31:05.075 --> 31:06.765
NSA?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.315
The National Security Agency.

31:08.350 --> 31:12.010
I see. I guess there have been a lot
of rumors about terrorist attacks.

31:15.310 --> 31:17.185
Did everything go well today?

31:17.220 --> 31:18.895
We've still got a lot of work to do.

31:18.930 --> 31:21.770
We're starting to barely make it
out with the naked eye, but...

31:21.805 --> 31:24.110
...it's nothing compared
to the Union's tower.

31:24.145 --> 31:25.825
That's not your fault.

31:25.860 --> 31:29.780
They're way beyond the basic physics of it.

31:29.815 --> 31:32.780
I saw those aerial shots, too.

31:37.450 --> 31:41.790
What I don't understand is why the
transformation stops 2 km from the tower.

31:42.830 --> 31:46.085
If it were going to be used
in an attack, it'd be useless.

31:46.120 --> 31:52.015
Maybe something isnt' working right,
or perhaps that's all it can do.

31:52.050 --> 31:53.500
Or maybe the transformation
itself caused...

31:53.750 --> 31:57.385
...some disruption the
designer couldn't foresee.

31:57.420 --> 32:00.250
Professor Tomisawa thinks
there's an external factor...

32:00.500 --> 32:02.940
...as to why the tower isn't
used at full capacity.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.860
What are you doing tomorrow, Shirakawa-kun?

32:12.895 --> 32:14.820
You don't have school, right?

32:15.320 --> 32:17.200
There's something I want to find out...

32:17.235 --> 32:18.165
At the library?

32:18.200 --> 32:20.795
No, at an acquaintance's factory.

32:20.830 --> 32:24.210
You want to see? We aren't exactly a museum.

32:24.245 --> 32:25.330
Huh? What?

32:26.290 --> 32:28.065
A girl? How old?

32:28.100 --> 32:29.840
I don't know!

32:30.670 --> 32:33.560
But she's beautiful... I think...

32:33.595 --> 32:36.450
Okay, we'll be waiting for you.

32:52.940 --> 32:53.700
Wow...

32:54.200 --> 32:56.240
What a big antenna.

32:57.530 --> 33:00.865
It's not exactly legal, but...

33:00.900 --> 33:03.960
.. we can connect to some
interesting places with this.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.710
So, you specialize in the
study of the brain, Maki-san?

33:11.745 --> 33:14.720
Yes. Memory, dreams, sleep.

33:15.470 --> 33:18.225
You work with Takuya, right?

33:18.260 --> 33:21.160
Weren't you doing research on the tower?

33:21.195 --> 33:24.060
Yes. I'm doing research on the tower...

33:24.095 --> 33:25.905
How do I explain this...

33:25.940 --> 33:28.230
Both of our fields deal
with parallel universes.

33:28.265 --> 33:29.860
Parallel universes?

33:30.940 --> 33:35.740
The same way people have dreams,
this universe also has dreams.

33:36.530 --> 33:41.750
This world hides what it could
have been in its dreams,

33:41.900 --> 33:46.290
and that's what we call
parallel or divergent universes.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.900
My research deals with how those parallel
universes affect the human brain and dreams.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.770
There are theories that the Union's
tower is doing the same research.

33:58.805 --> 34:03.105
We've been using technology to
observe these parallel worlds, but...

34:03.140 --> 34:08.965
...organisms from long ago may have
unconsciously been able to perceive them.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
At the quantum level of the brain,

34:12.250 --> 34:16.739
we think information from parallel
universes is what triggers precognition.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.989
That's the type of research I do.

34:21.025 --> 34:22.245
I see.

34:22.280 --> 34:26.040
It's kind of romantic to think
that the universe has dreams.

34:26.074 --> 34:27.371
Romantic?

34:27.407 --> 34:28.635
What?

34:28.670 --> 34:29.710
Nothing...

34:30.290 --> 34:32.804
But you're pretty good, Maki-san.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.175
So young, yet doing research for
a government advisory board.

34:36.210 --> 34:37.000
No, it's not like that.

34:37.250 --> 34:41.850
But I have always been drawn to
that tower, so I really like doing it.

34:42.889 --> 34:45.600
Me, too. To tell you the
truth, I'm drawn to you.

34:45.635 --> 34:48.815
But Shirakawa-kun is the one who's great!

34:48.850 --> 34:52.360
He's our youngest member,
but he works the hardest.

34:52.395 --> 34:54.860
I've always thought he was pretty cool!

34:54.895 --> 34:56.360
No, it's not like that...

34:56.820 --> 34:58.190
I don't do much...

35:04.240 --> 35:06.335
I have to be going soon.

35:06.370 --> 35:10.620
I'm sorry, it seems like I
ate most of the cake.

35:10.655 --> 35:12.130
Don't worry about it.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.380
Takuya...

35:15.880 --> 35:17.055
You going into town?

35:17.090 --> 35:19.220
Yeah, I'm dropping Maki-san off.

35:19.255 --> 35:20.720
Can I come?

35:20.755 --> 35:21.487
What?

35:21.522 --> 35:22.476
Sure.

35:22.511 --> 35:23.430
What?!

35:35.820 --> 35:37.780
Can you take me to the train station?

35:37.815 --> 35:39.705
Aren't you going home, Okabe-san?

35:39.740 --> 35:41.910
I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow to do some work.

35:44.410 --> 35:45.410
Okabe-san.

35:47.490 --> 35:50.290
Did you think about what I asked?

35:50.325 --> 35:51.807
What was it again?

35:51.842 --> 35:53.290
About the Uilta.

35:54.670 --> 35:56.255
You're so persistent.

35:56.290 --> 35:59.130
It seems you're working
pretty hard at the lab.

35:59.165 --> 36:01.010
That suits you better, doesn't it?

36:01.045 --> 36:02.765
It's not like that.

36:02.800 --> 36:06.850
I just want to get everything out of
the way concerning the tower.

36:06.885 --> 36:08.750
[September. Tokyo.]

36:11.980 --> 36:13.600
Can I help you?

36:13.635 --> 36:15.115
Oh, no.

36:15.150 --> 36:17.860
I just didn't think you could
see the tower from Tokyo.

36:17.895 --> 36:20.397
Oh, on some days you can.

36:20.432 --> 36:22.900
The air is very calm today.

36:22.935 --> 36:23.860
This way.

36:29.740 --> 36:32.875
Those are the reports from when she arrived.

36:32.910 --> 36:36.540
Her condition started in her third
year of middle school, cause unknown.

36:36.575 --> 36:38.675
The time she spent asleep became longer...

36:38.710 --> 36:44.180
The only time she was able to stay
awake was during the first two months...

36:44.215 --> 36:47.600
And she has been sleeping
for the past three years...

36:47.635 --> 36:50.012
So she keeps having dreams, right?

36:50.047 --> 36:52.390
Those brain waves have been recorded.

36:53.230 --> 36:54.520
How about a DNA analysis?

36:54.555 --> 36:55.730
See page six.

36:57.940 --> 37:01.740
I see. From a split blood line.

37:01.775 --> 37:03.115
Thank you.

37:03.150 --> 37:06.285
Here's the Health and
Labor Ministry's request.

37:06.320 --> 37:09.740
As soon as we confirm the move date,
you'll receive the proper documents.

37:10.620 --> 37:11.915
What's this letter?

37:11.950 --> 37:15.040
The patient wrote this letter
when she first arrived.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.250
Have you read it?

37:17.285 --> 37:18.460
No.

37:19.290 --> 37:21.460
Emishi Manufacturing...

37:43.940 --> 37:47.925
By examining the diversity of the
universes and how they occur...

37:47.960 --> 37:51.910
...we will be able to predict the
future with great accuracy.

37:51.945 --> 37:54.965
This is something we wish to achieve.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
This is not just a theory
as we have seen before,

37:58.250 --> 38:02.000
but something based on the reality
of the future and its outcome.

38:02.035 --> 38:06.975
The effect this will have on the government
and military is surely immeasurable.

38:07.010 --> 38:12.500
However, to put it bluntly,
the Union's technology...

38:12.750 --> 38:17.020
...concerning quantum gravitational
theory greatly surpasses our own.

38:17.480 --> 38:20.750
The symbolic tower that stands in Ezo...

38:21.000 --> 38:23.500
...was first started in '74
after the North-South divide,

38:23.750 --> 38:27.530
and is thought to have
been operational since '96.

38:27.565 --> 38:31.600
It does seem ironic because
the designer, Ekusun Tsukinoe,

38:31.850 --> 38:37.370
was born on the island of Honshu.

38:40.670 --> 38:41.925
So...

38:41.960 --> 38:45.250
Moving on, I will explain the
technological aspects...

38:45.500 --> 38:48.720
...of searching for these
parallel universes.

38:51.180 --> 38:54.025
I thought someone rude was in the room.

38:54.060 --> 38:57.250
I was listening. You were saying
you're trying to sneak...

38:57.500 --> 39:02.520
...a peek at God's dreams
and foresee the future, right?

39:02.555 --> 39:04.000
Well, you pretty much have it.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.070
Are you interested in that
kind of stuff, Oka-chan?

39:06.105 --> 39:08.035
I studied up on it a bit.

39:08.070 --> 39:10.570
Anyway, how would you like to do
something tonight, for old times' sake?

39:14.740 --> 39:16.370
Shirakawa-kun is really smart.

39:16.405 --> 39:18.262
He has a good nature.

39:18.297 --> 39:20.085
I told you he'd be good.

39:20.120 --> 39:24.290
Yeah, but when did you start
hiring students, Oka-chan?

39:24.325 --> 39:24.380
Well...

39:25.590 --> 39:28.510
...those guys were kind of special.

39:28.545 --> 39:29.515
Those guys?

39:29.550 --> 39:33.340
Yeah. There's another guy who's supposed to
be in Tokyo that I'm getting worried about.

39:33.375 --> 39:36.145
I can't reach him.

39:36.180 --> 39:38.890
They were making a plane together.

39:38.925 --> 39:40.912
That brings back memories.

39:40.947 --> 39:42.900
Is that why you came to Tokyo?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.750
I thought you'd be here for another reason.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.550
What did you think I was here for?

39:47.350 --> 39:48.750
The matter concerning the Uilta.

39:49.700 --> 39:52.250
Actually, you're right.
That's what I'm really here for.

39:52.755 --> 39:55.890
I've been able to get my hands
on a PL outer-shell bomb.

39:55.925 --> 39:57.835
Don't ask how, though.

39:57.870 --> 40:00.270
I think I know your source.

40:00.305 --> 40:01.735
So what?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.000
Are you going to ask if
it'll work on the tower?

40:04.900 --> 40:06.000
That's right.
