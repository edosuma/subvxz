-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:42.300
in a court of law.

00:42.333 --> 00:46.333
-Our crime rate has gone down
nearly 50% in five years.

00:46.367 --> 00:50.467
And that has a lot to do with
our community-oriented
policing style

00:50.500 --> 00:53.567
that has been recently
implemented in those five years.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.733
So, it's here, it's a testimony,
it shows that it works.

00:56.767 --> 00:59.467
And it works very well on
bringing the crime rate down.

01:01.167 --> 01:03.733
Well, he has an equipment
violation, his headlight's out.

01:03.767 --> 01:07.433
Stop him, it's more of
an informative stop.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.367
Lot of times people
aren't aware

01:09.400 --> 01:11.900
that they'll have a tail light
out or headlight out.

01:11.933 --> 01:13.833
Oh, he's running.

01:13.867 --> 01:16.400
-(siren blares)
-2-26, I got one.

01:16.433 --> 01:20.533
Evading in a vehicle.
Gonna be on West Tarrant.

01:20.567 --> 01:22.700
Leaving Belt Line headed--

01:22.733 --> 01:25.667
Gonna be headed westbound.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.633
Gonna be a teal F-150.

01:27.667 --> 01:31.833
Gonna be going
to Grand Prairie High.

01:31.867 --> 01:35.433
We're approaching Stadium
on West Tarrant.

01:35.467 --> 01:37.633
I can't see at all.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.067
-(tires screech)

01:47.067 --> 01:48.333
-We're turning on Lexington.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.067
Bailing on foot.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.800
Don't move!

02:04.833 --> 02:07.200
Stop right there
or you're gonna get tased!

02:07.233 --> 02:08.867
Taser, taser, taser!

02:08.900 --> 02:11.233
-(electricity buzzing)
-(man screaming)

02:11.267 --> 02:12.600
-Stop with the taser!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.100
-Hands on your face!

02:14.133 --> 02:16.167
Hands on your face!

02:16.200 --> 02:18.600
-I don't know what to do,
boss, tell me!

02:18.633 --> 02:20.967
-On your face!

02:21.067 --> 02:22.667
Get on your face!

02:22.700 --> 02:24.467
-Okay, okay!

02:24.500 --> 02:25.767
-On your stomach.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.467
-Yes, sir.
-Do it now!

02:27.500 --> 02:28.967
-Okay!

02:29.067 --> 02:30.900
Oh, god!
-2-26,

02:30.933 --> 02:34.200
have one tased
near building ten.

02:34.233 --> 02:35.700
Hands behind your back.

02:35.733 --> 02:38.233
-Oh! Oh...

02:38.267 --> 02:40.167
-(panting)

02:44.967 --> 02:46.233
-Hands behind your back!

02:46.267 --> 02:47.400
-Yes, sir!

02:48.867 --> 02:52.133
-2-26, got one in custody.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.433
You live here?

02:53.467 --> 02:54.533
-Woman: Uh-huh.

02:54.567 --> 02:55.867
-Does he live here?

02:55.900 --> 02:56.933
-Who is that?

02:56.967 --> 02:59.100
-It's Benny.

02:59.133 --> 03:00.600
-Go back inside, ma'am.

03:00.633 --> 03:02.100
-Help! Please, help me!

03:02.133 --> 03:04.233
You shot me
in the chest, boss.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.167
-I'm gonna let you have him.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.967
-Oh, my god.

03:09.067 --> 03:10.733
-You got wires on you.

03:10.767 --> 03:14.200
-2-26, suspect vehicle is in
front of the apartment complex.

03:14.233 --> 03:17.333
Everyone's detained.
There's only one driver,
one suspect.

03:17.367 --> 03:18.667
-Stand up.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.433
-Come on.
-Okay, boss, I'm trying.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.633
-Let's go.

03:24.067 --> 03:25.533
-Oh, (bleep).

03:25.567 --> 03:26.900
-Go right here.

03:26.933 --> 03:29.067
-I want my (bleep)

03:32.700 --> 03:34.567
-What's your name, bro?

03:34.600 --> 03:37.067
-My name's Benny.

03:37.067 --> 03:38.967
Oww...

03:39.067 --> 03:40.400
-You have an ID?

03:40.433 --> 03:42.233
-Yes, sir.
-Where is it?

03:42.267 --> 03:43.533
-It's at home.

03:43.567 --> 03:45.367
-Okay. All you had to do
is stop, man.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.200
-Let's get him in this
car here.

03:47.233 --> 03:49.767
-Oh...
-Come on.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.467
One foot at a time.
There you go.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.733
-Please, listen
just a little bit, please.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.267
I'm not a bad person.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.633
-You doing all right?

03:58.067 --> 04:00.100
-Better than I was
ten minutes ago.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.167
-Okay.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.900
-Ugh.
-I'm about to check those,

04:02.933 --> 04:04.067
just don't move, okay?

04:04.067 --> 04:05.800
But first I gotta talk
to you real quick.

04:05.833 --> 04:07.133
-Okay.

04:07.167 --> 04:08.667
I'm not gonna lie to you,
officer,

04:08.700 --> 04:10.700
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.400
-Okay. Why were
you running tonight, man?

04:12.433 --> 04:13.867
All you had to do was stop.

04:13.900 --> 04:16.400
-That dumb ass bitch told me--
She said, "this is
a stolen vehicle."

04:16.433 --> 04:18.100
I said, "No the (bleep)
it's not."

04:18.133 --> 04:21.200
She said, "Yeah, I took it from
some guy named Johnny."

04:21.233 --> 04:23.333
-Yeah?
-I said, "Johnny who?"

04:23.367 --> 04:25.267
She said, "Johnny who's
been on the run."

04:25.300 --> 04:27.500
-Okay.
-I said, "So what do you
want me to do?"

04:27.533 --> 04:31.067
I said, "I"m good. I only have
a warrant out because
I didn't show up--"

04:32.133 --> 04:33.133
(coughs)

04:33.167 --> 04:34.467
"'Cause I didn't show up
for court

04:34.500 --> 04:36.567
"because I missed it because
my dad wasn't home

04:36.600 --> 04:37.967
"so I didn't have a ride there."

04:38.067 --> 04:39.667
-Okay.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.067
-She said, "well, I have drugs
on me and a gun."

04:42.100 --> 04:44.800
So she said, "You need
to pull over right now."

04:44.833 --> 04:47.733
I said, "Well, look, I'm not
gonna stay and do it right here.

04:47.767 --> 04:51.300
"I'll run this red light,
and I'll come down here
and I'll stop."

04:51.333 --> 04:53.633
She's like,
"Well, here's the gun."

04:53.667 --> 04:55.100
She throws it
in my (bleep) lap.

04:55.133 --> 04:56.600
I freak out, officer.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.233
I just get out
and I take off running.

04:58.267 --> 05:00.400
-I understand.
When did you see me?

05:02.067 --> 05:03.567
-What do you mean?
-When did you see me?

05:03.600 --> 05:05.800
Like, when I turned on
my red and blues?

05:05.833 --> 05:07.600
Or did you see me
turn around on you?

05:09.333 --> 05:11.100
-Whenever I seen
you turn around on me.

05:11.133 --> 05:13.333
I said, "Look,
there's a cop coming."

05:13.367 --> 05:16.367
And you got behind me,
and I was about to put it
in park right there.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.767
'Cause I'm already
at a red light.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.100
-And that's when
she said all this?

05:19.133 --> 05:20.767
-Yeah, that's when she
said all this.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.167
-Okay.
-I said, "What the (bleep)?
what do you want me to do?"

05:23.200 --> 05:24.600
And she pointed the gun at me,

05:24.633 --> 05:27.600
she's like, just go and she
throws the gun in my lap.

05:27.633 --> 05:30.267
And I didn't-- I freak out.
What am I supposed to do?

05:30.300 --> 05:32.067
I'm not gonna pick the gun up.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.733
'Cause then when you run up
to my window, you're gonna
point a gun at me.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.067
-Yeah.
-Obviously.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.267
-What kind of gun was it?

05:37.300 --> 05:40.633
-It was some big-ass
mother (bleep) revolver.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.067
I don't know what
it was, boss.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.333
-Was it--
-I have no idea.

05:43.367 --> 05:44.600
-What color was it?

05:45.833 --> 05:47.867
-It was a--
It was a black one.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.067
Black and silver.

05:49.067 --> 05:50.600
-What portion of it was silver?

05:50.633 --> 05:52.733
-The barrel that was
pointed at my face.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.400
-She pointed it
at you, too?
-Hell, yeah.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.867
-She pointed that
bitch right at-- I don't see
how you didn't see it.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.567
-Well, all my lights were
reflecting off that black glass

05:59.600 --> 06:01.467
so it was hard to see.
All right, bud.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.067
Well, we just had the paramedics
check you out, okay?

06:04.067 --> 06:05.500
-I just need some water.
-Okay.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.067
-You got-- Right there in the
door panel, you got two guns.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.700
-Ah.
-Bunch of shotgun shells.

06:12.733 --> 06:13.833
Have a cell phone.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.300
-There is a revolver, you know?

06:15.333 --> 06:18.167
I didn't think he was gonna
be honest about that, but...

06:18.200 --> 06:21.767
-There's two cell phones, too.
I'm sure those belong to them.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.233
-You know, he said that female
tossed the revolver in his lap.

06:25.267 --> 06:27.433
And then at one point he said
she pointed it at him.

06:27.467 --> 06:29.067
But, you know,
when I see it there,

06:29.100 --> 06:32.233
very unlikely she tossed it
into his lap

06:32.267 --> 06:33.867
and then during that chase

06:33.900 --> 06:36.567
conveniently tucked it perfectly
into the door jamb

06:36.600 --> 06:38.333
in its holster.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.433
Hello, ma'am, what's your name?

06:41.467 --> 06:43.433
-I'm Whitney.
I'm his girlfriend.

06:43.467 --> 06:45.433
I just got picked up because
I heard he got arrested.

06:45.467 --> 06:47.467
So I was just trying to see
what's going on.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.933
-Do you know a Christa?

06:48.967 --> 06:50.833
-Um, Chrissy?
-Yeah.

06:50.867 --> 06:53.200
-Uh, I know--
I've heard of her.

06:53.233 --> 06:56.067
Like, his friend.
That's a friend of his.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.433
-All right.
-Yeah.

06:58.467 --> 07:00.500
Some girl, like,
that he talks to

07:00.533 --> 07:02.067
that we got in
an argument about.

07:02.067 --> 07:05.167
-Okay. He's going to jail for
evading with her in a vehicle.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.467
-In this unit it seems like
we don't have a lot of time off.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.633
We're either at work
all the time,

07:11.667 --> 07:13.467
or we're at home
fielding phone calls.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.067
So when I am off, I do like
to spend

07:15.100 --> 07:16.600
as much time as I can
with my daughter

07:16.633 --> 07:18.367
traveling around watching her
play softball.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.600
Or, if I get a chance, I like
to ride my Harley as much
as possible.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.400
Usually also with my daughter.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.400
We're gonna stop a car up here.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.633
One of the detectives saw it
cut through a parking lot

07:27.667 --> 07:29.067
to avoid a traffic light,

07:29.100 --> 07:33.367
which is common for stolen cars
in this area.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.200
-Woman on radio:
82551, 82551.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.100
-Where are you guys
headed now?

07:42.133 --> 07:43.367
-Um, right up the road.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.433
-Up the road?

07:44.467 --> 07:46.100
-Yeah. I don't know the area
to well,

07:46.133 --> 07:47.700
so I was just taking directions.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.600
-Why are you shaking so much?

07:49.633 --> 07:51.900
-I'm not shaking.
-Yeah, you are.

07:51.933 --> 07:53.467
-Where were you going?

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
Why'd you cut through that
intersection to blow the light?

07:55.533 --> 07:57.800
-Uh, you know why, I--
-What intersection?

07:57.833 --> 07:59.400
-Right here.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.800
You went through
the parking lot.
-The store.

08:01.833 --> 08:03.267
To avoid the light.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.700
-Oh, I don't know. I was
just in a rush.

08:05.733 --> 08:07.133
-You in a rush?

08:07.167 --> 08:08.933
Why you in a rush?
-I'm supposed to be home.

08:08.967 --> 08:11.467
-Yeah, she's supposed to
be home. They picked me up
from Father Joe's over here.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.133
-She can talk. I don't need you
to answer for her.

08:13.167 --> 08:14.333
-I'm not talking to you.
-I'm sorry.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.767
-Okay, why don't you
hop out of the car.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.933
-Smells like weed.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.367
-You got any weed
or anything in the car?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.867
-I do not.
-Smelling some weed.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.067
Can you just do me a favor
and step to the back
of the car for me?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.267
-Sure.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.967
-Whose car is it?
-It's my car.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.333
-All right.

08:26.367 --> 08:29.067
You got the most to lose
'cause it's your car.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.200
-Where'd you say
you were coming from

08:31.233 --> 08:32.933
-Father Joe's house
over there.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.367
It's a sober house.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.467
And they were going home
to West Milford tonight,

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
so I told them that I would
take a ride home with them.

08:38.533 --> 08:39.633
-Yeah, to buy some drugs?

08:39.667 --> 08:41.267
-No, I don't
shoot no drugs, sir.

08:41.300 --> 08:42.867
-Okay.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.967
-Now we'll just
search the vehicle

08:45.067 --> 08:46.267
and see if we can
find narcotics

08:46.300 --> 08:47.767
or anything else
in the vehicle.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.133
-Oh, look, a needle.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.900
-A needle? No way.
-Watch your hands.

08:50.933 --> 08:52.533
-Oh, another one.

08:52.567 --> 08:55.067
-Two spikes.

08:55.067 --> 08:58.100
-On this side of the car there
was a hypodermic syringe,

08:58.133 --> 09:00.667
which is commonly used
to inject heroin.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.167
Oh, my god, look at that.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.733
-Oh, a $20 bag of coke.

09:03.767 --> 09:06.400
And a sonogram of
the kid that she's gonna have.

09:06.433 --> 09:08.133
-It's amazing what you find
when you look.

09:08.167 --> 09:10.767
-So far we found
a bag of cocaine

09:10.800 --> 09:12.567
and Suboxone pills,

09:12.600 --> 09:15.133
which are taken by heroin
addicts when they detox.

09:15.167 --> 09:17.233
Guess what,
we found drugs in the car.

09:17.267 --> 09:20.667
And I would have been willing
to bet my paycheck

09:20.700 --> 09:22.167
that I was gonna
find drugs in the car

09:22.200 --> 09:24.067
when I came up to this car.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.433
-I did not know there were
drugs in the car, honestly.

09:26.467 --> 09:27.833
-You didn't know?
-I did not.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.200
-It was right on your side.

09:29.233 --> 09:30.467
-Yeah.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.500
-Of the driver's side
of the vehicle where you were.

09:32.533 --> 09:34.067
-Okay.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.733
This is not my car.
-Whose car is it?

09:35.767 --> 09:37.200
-It's his car. Chris.

09:37.233 --> 09:38.367
-I really don't know.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.133
I don't think there's
anything else in here.

09:40.167 --> 09:42.567
-Listen, you lied to me once
already. You told me there's
no drugs in the car.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.467
-We found a bag
in the driver door,

09:44.500 --> 09:47.067
and then we found two spikes
in your glove compartment.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.500
So this is your car.

09:48.533 --> 09:50.300
You're gonna eat it
with your friends.
-Okay.

09:50.333 --> 09:51.767
-All right?
-I really don't know what else.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.233
-What else?
Whatever else we find.

09:53.267 --> 09:54.967
-There's nothing else in there.
-Nothing else there.

09:55.067 --> 09:57.967
So I should believe you?
Because that's what you
said the first time.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.000
-I didn't say anything
the first time. I'm saying--

10:00.000 --> 10:00.067
-I didn't say anything
the first time. I'm saying--
-Exactly. You didn't say
anything. But you said there
was nothing in the car.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.533
-Exactly. You didn't say
anything. But you said there
was nothing in the car.

10:02.567 --> 10:03.733
That's what you said to me.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.400
I said, "Is there anything
in the car?" You said no.

10:05.433 --> 10:06.867
"Do you have anything
on you?" You said no.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.333
-I don't have anything on me.

10:08.367 --> 10:10.267
-So that's your needle then?
'Cause that was in the glovebox.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.700
-I'm not gonna
say anything, to be honest.

10:11.733 --> 10:13.000
-Oh, okay.

10:13.033 --> 10:14.600
-All right.
Nobody knows anything.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.067
Come on over here, man.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.600
Why are we in Paterson?

10:17.633 --> 10:19.733
-I shouldn't--
-You came here with these
guys to buy drugs.

10:19.767 --> 10:21.833
-I shouldn't have came down
here, that's what I'm
trying to say.

10:21.867 --> 10:23.567
But I don't know what else
they got in that car.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.133
-So what does that mean?
You obviously know there's more.
-I think they have some.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.767
Yeah, because they shoot.
I don't shoot, dude.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.367
-So where's
the heroin in the car?

10:29.400 --> 10:31.000
-I don't know.
-Did you guys just buy it?

10:31.033 --> 10:32.333
-I think she did.

10:32.367 --> 10:33.700
-So where is it?
It's on her?

10:33.733 --> 10:35.633
-I think so, dude.
That's my-- I just--

10:35.667 --> 10:37.433
'Cause I don't want to be
charged with anything, dude.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.933
You know what I mean?
I'm trying to go home
to my mother.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.867
-All right. We don't want
to hear what your mom tells you.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.267
-Do the right thing, brother.
That's why I'm trying
to talk to you, bro.

10:44.300 --> 10:45.433
-Go stand by the police car.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.067
-Do we have a female
officer available?

10:47.100 --> 10:49.367
-One of the guys says she
probably has heroin on her.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.133
We told her six times, if you
have it, give it up now.

10:53.167 --> 10:55.300
-Turn around and face me
with your hands on your head.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.800
Nothing in here's
gonna stick me?

10:56.833 --> 10:58.400
-Mm-mm.
-Nothing nowhere?

10:58.433 --> 11:00.067
-I'm not gonna
find any needles?

11:00.067 --> 11:01.667
You sure?

11:03.400 --> 11:04.633
What's that?

11:04.667 --> 11:06.800
Seriously? Or is that something
that could have stuck me?

11:10.067 --> 11:12.367
-Ta-dah!
-That was dumb.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.833
Didn't I ask you
if you had a needle on you?
-That's what I said.

11:14.867 --> 11:17.100
The second time I said yeah.
-I asked you if you
had a needle, right?

11:17.133 --> 11:19.700
-Oh, two needles, nice.
I could have got stuck twice.

11:19.733 --> 11:21.567
How many times did I ask you
if you had a needle on you?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.200
-The second time
I did say yeah.

11:24.467 --> 11:26.567
-Looks like it's gonna
be three bundles of heroin.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.733
Which is about
approximately 30 pieces.

11:28.767 --> 11:32.067
Jessica, am I understanding
right from one of my detectives
that you're also pregnant?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.467
-Yeah. I just found out.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.633
-And at some point you
thought this was a good idea?

11:35.667 --> 11:37.300
Okay, well,
you're under arrest.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.067
Come on.
We're gonna put you in the car.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.600
-Have a seat.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.600
-Just so you know, your boy
sold you out.

11:48.633 --> 11:50.333
'Cause he told us that
you had the heroin on you.

11:50.367 --> 11:51.700
And you're how far
along pregnant?

11:51.733 --> 11:55.167
-I just found out. I'm not sure
the exact amount of time.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.067
I'm supposed to go
to the doctor next week.

11:58.067 --> 12:00.500
-When did you find out?
Just recently?
-Just recently.

12:00.533 --> 12:03.200
-I hope you haven't used
since you found out.

12:03.233 --> 12:06.200
-No, I've been on Suboxone

12:06.233 --> 12:09.133
stressing out about switching
my medication

12:09.167 --> 12:12.333
to Subutex because I'm not
supposed to be on Suboxone.

12:12.367 --> 12:14.233
It's just--
It's been very rough.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.667
Since I found out
it's been a lot.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.333
-Okay.

12:18.367 --> 12:20.133
Were you planning on using?

12:20.167 --> 12:23.067
-No, I was planning on going
home to my mom tonight.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.567
(crying)

12:24.600 --> 12:26.633
I've been in that car
the past week.

12:26.667 --> 12:29.600
I've been, like, supposed
to go to my mom's tonight.

12:29.633 --> 12:31.900
And everything's
supposed to get better.

12:31.933 --> 12:34.433
-You're living out of the car?
-I was, yeah.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.433
-All right.

12:38.433 --> 12:39.967
Chris, come on.
We're gonna put you in the car.

12:40.067 --> 12:41.367
This way.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.767
Do you understand
what's going on, Chris?
-Yup.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.233
-Understand why you're in
handcuffs and why you're
going to jail?

12:50.267 --> 12:52.100
-I told you, I want to take
the charges, too.

12:52.133 --> 12:53.833
-What's that?
-I'm taking all the charges.

12:53.867 --> 12:55.967
-You can't take her charges.
It's in her possession.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.133
-I put it in there.
-Chris, you understand
you have warrants?

12:58.167 --> 13:00.367
-Yeah.
-That's why you're
in handcuffs as well.

13:02.267 --> 13:04.833
-You're also aware
your girlfriend's pregnant?
-Yeah.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.400
-And you don't have a problem
coming out here with her
to buy heroin?

13:09.067 --> 13:10.667
I'm assuming it's your child?

13:10.700 --> 13:12.067
-Yeah.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.867
-If you'd like to go to court
and tell the judge

13:13.900 --> 13:15.500
that it's yours not hers,
that's up to you.

13:15.533 --> 13:16.667
-I'm not saying
anything else.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.700
-Okay.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.600
So the taller bald gentleman,
his main objective was

13:24.633 --> 13:27.100
to tell us what we wanted
to know so we'd let him loose.

13:27.133 --> 13:29.467
I mean, at this point,
we really had no reason
to arrest him anyway

13:29.500 --> 13:30.933
'cause she had it all
on her person.

13:33.767 --> 13:36.167
-Compassion's really important
for us to have out here
as police officers.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.533
Because a lot of times when
we deal with people

13:38.567 --> 13:40.300
it's a terrible day for them.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.900
So for us to put ourselves
in their shoes,

13:42.933 --> 13:45.567
it helps us get through
to people a whole lot better.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.500
And lets them know that--

13:48.533 --> 13:51.733
you know, the police officers
are people that can be trusted
and be talked to

13:51.767 --> 13:54.600
and genuinely care about them.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.200
-About 15 minutes ago
there was

13:57.233 --> 13:59.767
a robbery that occurred
at a local liquor store here.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.067
And officers obtained
some information

14:03.067 --> 14:05.167
that the suspect involved
in that robbery

14:05.200 --> 14:07.367
is staying at one of
the local motels.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.967
Now we're gonna try to go
over to this motel

14:09.067 --> 14:10.767
and make contact
with this suspect.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.433
-Man on radio:
Black male, gray shirt.
About 5'8", medium build.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.100
-Guys, I got lethal.

14:20.133 --> 14:22.533
-You go here.
Who's on the back?

14:22.567 --> 14:24.267
-I don't think there is a back.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.467
-There's no window?
They climbed out a window
earlier on us.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.100
-Try knocking.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.433
-Show us your hands!
-Get on the ground!

14:33.467 --> 14:35.367
-Get on the ground now!
-Get on the ground!

14:35.400 --> 14:37.500
-Get down on the ground!
-Sit on the ground!

14:37.533 --> 14:39.100
-Get down! Get down!
-On the ground!

14:39.133 --> 14:41.133
-I didn't do nothing!

14:41.167 --> 14:43.267
-Get your hands behind your back
or you're gonna get popped.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.067
Get your hands behind your back.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.567
-I didn't do nothing!

14:46.600 --> 14:48.067
-Cuffs, cuffs.
-I got it.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.300
-I didn't do nothing!

14:49.333 --> 14:51.067
-We're gonna get
you some clothes,

14:51.067 --> 14:52.800
and then we're gonna get you
in a police car,

14:52.833 --> 14:55.300
and then we will go
from there, okay?

14:55.333 --> 14:57.067
-I didn't do nothing!

14:57.100 --> 14:59.600
-You're under arrest, Bryant.
-What'd I do?

14:59.633 --> 15:01.667
-You have warrants.
-For what?

15:01.700 --> 15:03.300
-We'll talk to you about it
when you get outside.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.233
Relax, okay? Right now--
-What I got a warrant for?

15:05.267 --> 15:07.333
-Calm down. Let us get through
what we need to get through.

15:07.367 --> 15:10.733
Okay? And then we're gonna talk
to you about what happened
at the liquor store, okay?

15:10.767 --> 15:12.733
-So what's going on?

15:12.767 --> 15:14.900
-Obviously you know we
showed up here for some reason.

15:14.933 --> 15:16.933
Okay? So we'll talk about it.

15:16.967 --> 15:18.833
Just relax and we'll go
through it together.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.500
-So what am I being
arrested for?

15:20.533 --> 15:23.300
-Right now you're being arrested
for theft of this liquor

15:23.333 --> 15:24.733
that happened over
at the liquor store.

15:24.767 --> 15:27.100
So that's where we're at.
-I've been in here, man.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.100
-I understand that you say that,

15:29.133 --> 15:30.700
but everything
that you're wearing,

15:30.733 --> 15:32.233
and your physical description

15:32.267 --> 15:35.067
is exactly the suspect's
description when this occurred.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.500
Now I'm gonna ask you
your side of the story
and what occurred.

15:37.533 --> 15:39.667
-I was looking for
some Gentleman Jack.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.767
-Okay.
-You know what I'm saying?
He didn't have none.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.267
-All right.
-So he suspected
I stole the bottle.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.067
I didn't steal no bottle.

15:46.067 --> 15:48.600
-What I'm saying is is that you
did leave that store with
a bottle of liquor.

15:48.633 --> 15:50.500
You guys fought over it
in the parking lot.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.967
And I'm gonna suspect that
that's the bottle of liquor.

15:53.067 --> 15:55.433
In order for me to help you,
I've got to have honesty.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.867
-That's not Jack.
I didn't steal no bottle.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.467
-Something was
stolen from there.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.733
'Cause the bottle was in your
shirt when you fought with him.

16:01.767 --> 16:04.533
This is all on video.
You know how many cameras
they have in that thing?

16:04.567 --> 16:07.967
I don't want to see you get
caught up in court when
they plug in that tape

16:08.067 --> 16:10.067
and it shows you,
like I saw,

16:10.100 --> 16:12.300
stuffing a bottle in the front
of your pants,

16:12.333 --> 16:14.833
putting your shirt over,
and then trying to walk out,

16:14.867 --> 16:16.600
and then the clerk says,
"Hey, hey, hey, stop."

16:16.633 --> 16:18.067
The officer pulls up,

16:18.100 --> 16:19.767
you break free, run,
and bolt over a fence.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.400
Everything that I just told
you is what you didn't tell me.

16:22.433 --> 16:24.633
It's what I saw with my own
eyes on video.

16:24.667 --> 16:29.267
Now, honestly, man-to-man,
me to you, is that the bottle?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.267
-That bottle right,
that's not Jack Daniels.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.967
I already had that.
-I know it's not Jack Daniels.
Man, I can read.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.067
But you're digging yourself
a hole

16:36.067 --> 16:38.267
that's gonna be bad
for you in the long run.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.700
And I don't want to see that.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.067
Because you seem
like a good dude.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.767
-I am.
-You're being
respectful with me.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.067
You just made a mistake,
brother, and we
all make mistakes.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.833
And right now, you are
in a jam.

16:46.867 --> 16:49.400
You have all the evidence.
I've told you what you've done.

16:49.433 --> 16:52.200
I'm wanting you to say,
"This officer's got me.

16:52.233 --> 16:53.833
"And he's been respectful.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.400
"And right now I'm gonna
do what I can

16:55.433 --> 16:56.667
"because his fate's
in my hands,

16:56.700 --> 16:58.367
"so I'm gonna try to tell
him the truth."

16:58.400 --> 17:00.100
And all of that truth.

17:00.133 --> 17:01.433
Okay?

17:01.467 --> 17:03.833
And I just want to sew this up,
and let's do it together.

17:03.867 --> 17:06.233
Now talk to me truthful about
the bottle that you left with.

17:06.267 --> 17:07.967
-That's where I want
the honesty.

17:08.067 --> 17:09.900
Okay? This is the bottle?

17:09.933 --> 17:11.933
Okay. Did you get any
other bottles,

17:11.967 --> 17:13.500
or was it just this one?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.067
-Just that one.
-Okay.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.900
Now you're aware that
that was theft, right?

17:16.933 --> 17:19.300
You knew what you were doing
when you was walking
out of there.

17:19.333 --> 17:22.967
Now when he tried to stop you
at the door, Bryant,

17:23.067 --> 17:24.667
what happened there?

17:24.700 --> 17:26.967
Can you just say-- Just tell me
'cause I understand
he tried to stop you.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.400
-He pushed me
and I took off running.

17:28.433 --> 17:30.067
-Okay. Now you say
he pushed you.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.400
Now, remember,
I've seen the video.

17:31.433 --> 17:32.667
'Cause I've seen
him doing this.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.067
-I mean,
I was trying to get out.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.400
-Did you push him
to get out of the way?

17:35.433 --> 17:37.833
-I didn't-- I wasn't--
Know what I'm saying?

17:37.867 --> 17:40.667
-I mean, I know you didn't
clock him or nothing like that.
-No, I was just trying to--

17:40.700 --> 17:42.267
-You just trying to check him?
-Mm-hmm.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.967
-Okay, so you just
checked him to get
out of the way

17:44.067 --> 17:45.900
and you just wanted to get out
of there without anything--

17:45.933 --> 17:48.133
-But when we got down
the street, he hit me.
-Okay.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.967
-And you know, I don't blame him
'cause I took the bottle.

17:52.067 --> 17:54.867
I understand. I got a problem.
-Bryant...

17:54.900 --> 17:57.267
-And I'm probably gonna
lose my job and everything.

17:57.300 --> 18:00.067
Know what I mean?
I'm from Arkansas, man.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.500
-That's not a bad state.

18:01.533 --> 18:03.900
But I been to prison there,

18:03.933 --> 18:07.067
I moved to Minnesota. l've been
to prison in Minnesota.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.067
You know what I mean?
I got--

18:09.067 --> 18:12.633
When I was younger,
I got in a lot of bull crap.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.533
-I understand.
-Because of my history.

18:14.567 --> 18:17.200
Using drugs, you know
what I mean?

18:17.233 --> 18:20.067
Just trying to kill the...

18:20.100 --> 18:21.567
-Pain?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.833
Well, listen to me, this is
the first step to solving
the problem.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.067
-Sometimes I wanna kill
my own self, man.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.867
'Cause I know I--
-Watch your cigarette
on your shorts.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.400
-I know I can do better than.

18:29.433 --> 18:32.500
I know I'm a better person.
I was raised better.

18:32.533 --> 18:34.533
Now I'm in Kansas, man,

18:34.567 --> 18:36.500
and pfft...
-Tonight's the first step.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.933
Okay?

18:37.967 --> 18:39.533
First step.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.267
You wanna walk outside
and get some air, man?

18:41.300 --> 18:43.300
Let's get to the car.
-Smoke my Scaffold?

18:43.333 --> 18:44.533
-Yeah, you can finish that.

18:44.567 --> 18:46.300
As long as you stay
cool from here on out, man,

18:46.333 --> 18:48.333
there ain't gonna be
no problems.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.767
Hey, one of these guys is gonna
take you to a car, okay?

18:50.800 --> 18:53.433
I'm gonna talk to the boss
and see what we can do, okay?

18:53.467 --> 18:55.267
Keep your head up.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.067
Keep your head up. Okay?

18:58.100 --> 18:59.100
-I'm not a--

18:59.133 --> 19:00.633
-I know. Keep your head up.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.500
-Let's just come over here and
we'll talk about it together.

19:02.533 --> 19:03.900
-I got problems, man.

19:03.933 --> 19:06.900
You know what I'm saying?
I got problems bad, man.
-I know.

19:06.933 --> 19:09.600
And I bet it has everything
to do with crack-cocaine.

19:09.633 --> 19:11.067
Am I right?

19:11.067 --> 19:13.067
I know. It's a beast, man.

19:13.067 --> 19:15.167
We all make bad choices.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.533
All right? Come on.
Let's get in the car.

19:16.567 --> 19:18.667
And you can always get
through it. Let's start today.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.367
Do you want to just lean here
and get some air for a minute?

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
Do you mind standing with him
while he finishes smoking?

19:25.433 --> 19:26.967
-No problem.
-For right now, tonight,

19:27.067 --> 19:29.833
I'm gonna book you in there for
the robbery over the liquor.
Okay?

19:29.867 --> 19:32.233
Now what I'd like to--
-Would that be a felony
or misdemeanor?

19:32.267 --> 19:34.667
-It is a felony. Okay?
It's a felony.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.567
So I'm not gonna lie. I told you
I wouldn't lie to you and I have
no intention to now.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.167
You'll be there
through the weekend.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.433
Monday is when they'll
look at the case,

19:41.467 --> 19:43.100
and decide what they're
gonna do further.

19:43.133 --> 19:44.733
Okay? So you just
hang in there.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.367
All right? And you can
always get through it.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.633
Let's start today.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.467
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.433
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.467 --> 19:55.600
Cover is code three.

19:55.633 --> 19:58.600
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.433 --> 20:07.400
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.433 --> 20:08.600
-(theme music playing)
