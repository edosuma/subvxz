00:02.001 --> 00:03.753
Previously on Lost:

00:05.756 --> 00:08.841
- Has anyone seen Ethan?
- He took off on the path to the beach.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.843
There might have been a struggle.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.637
I think they've been taken.

00:32.073 --> 00:35.076
If you do not stop following me,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.745
I will kill one of them.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.291
- Over here!
- Jack!

00:42.376 --> 00:43.918
Where's Jack?

00:46.171 --> 00:48.423
- We need the doctor.
- He's right there.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.049
- Right there.
- Find someone!

00:50.134 --> 00:51.634
What happened?

00:52.428 --> 00:54.095
Doctor!

00:54.179 --> 00:56.305
- Claire!
- Is she alive?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.725
- What happened?
- Is she all right?

00:59.268 --> 01:00.560
Is she OK?

01:01.478 --> 01:04.397
- Where'd you find her?
- A mile north, looking for the dog.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.733
- Conscious?
- She collapsed in my arms.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.985
- Did she say anything?
- Is she injured?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.989
Is she all right?

01:13.824 --> 01:16.909
Everybody needs to back off, OK?
Just give her some air.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.254
Claire. Can you hear me?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.633
Wake up now. Hey.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.181
Wake up now.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.183
Hey.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.311
It's OK.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.856
Hey, it's OK.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.858
It's OK.

01:51.487 --> 01:54.197
OK. You're safe.

01:55.866 --> 02:06.417
Who are you?

02:06.502 --> 02:08.919
Who are you people?

02:31.068 --> 02:32.777
I don't understand.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.987
I don't know any Ethan.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.074
I don't remember.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.747
I don't remember any of you.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.582
I don't remember any of this.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.086
What do you remember?

02:55.259 --> 02:58.135
I was on a plane...

02:58.220 --> 02:59.887
...flying to LA from Sydney.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.314
We were all on that plane.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.942
It crashed here, on this island.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.739
That was almost a month ago.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.326
No! I'm due...

03:22.411 --> 03:24.161
Your baby's fine. He's kicking.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.456
Everything's normal. OK?

03:30.544 --> 03:34.297
Well, if it's been a month,
then why hasn't somebody come to get us?

04:16.464 --> 04:18.173
You think she escaped?

04:18.926 --> 04:21.969
You were right beside me, Boone.
You know as much as I do.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.180
But where'd she come from?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.765
We were out pretty deep.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.309
Nothing's out there.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.937
She didn't say anything about Ethan?

04:31.021 --> 04:33.147
She doesn't even remember Ethan.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.442
The guy pretends to be one of us,
he drags her into the jungle.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.027
She doesn't remember him?

04:39.863 --> 04:41.155
Apparently.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.370
You think he's around?

04:49.873 --> 04:52.041
I sure hope not.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.463
Here's your journal.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.383
It might help.

05:02.344 --> 05:06.472
And this is where you sleep.
It's quite cozy, isn't it?

05:14.856 --> 05:17.858
When he, Ethan...

05:17.943 --> 05:22.071
...when he took you away,
he took me too.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.741
The others came after us.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.203
They got me back. But you...

05:29.287 --> 05:30.830
You were gone.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.917
Who is he? Ethan?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.506
Ethan...

05:42.551 --> 05:44.635
Ethan's the bad guy.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.889
So we were together when...

05:48.974 --> 05:50.599
Yeah.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.937
Well, why did he leave you?

05:56.606 --> 06:00.401
Why don't we leave that lovely story
for the morning?

06:01.570 --> 06:03.362
You've had enough for one day.

06:03.447 --> 06:04.947
No, I won't be sleeping.

06:05.449 --> 06:08.701
Oh... lucky for me.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.454
Not much of a sleeper myself.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.748
Finally, I'll have someone
to stay up with.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.420
We're friends?

06:22.841 --> 06:27.303
Yeah, we're friends.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.647
How's that feel, mate?

06:39.691 --> 06:43.402
- Sodding fantastic.
- Good 'cause we're almost out.

06:43.487 --> 06:47.239
But we're not out yet?
Carpe diem, my friend.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.700
Save your French for someone
who appreciates it.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.328
Latin, Tommy. It's Latin.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.122
Well, is it Latin for
"I've got a pile of money

06:55.207 --> 06:59.877
so we can score vast quantities
of illicit substances?"

06:59.961 --> 07:03.089
- No.
- I suppose you ought to clean up then.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.257
It's time to put you to work.

07:14.726 --> 07:19.105
Ms. Lucy Heatherton, 22 and ripe
in oh, so many wonderful ways.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.524
Just graduated from Oxford,

07:21.608 --> 07:25.903
lives in Knightsbridge with dear
old dad, Mr. Francis Price Heatherton,

07:25.987 --> 07:28.781
who, my friend, is bloody loaded.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.118
How you amass this information
never ceases to amaze me.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.204
Ready to fall in love, Mr. Charlie Pace

07:35.288 --> 07:38.165
of the legendary rock band, Drive Shaft?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.711
Absolutely.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.475
Seriously, ladies, I demand you stop
buying me more drinks.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.980
I'm a man of high moral standing.

08:01.064 --> 08:04.316
Your obvious plan to take me home
and ravage me will not work.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.360
Saucy sirens.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.446
I believe in monogamy.
I will not be shared like a curry.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.241
- Are we that obvious?
- Dreadfully.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.161
Call yourself ladies.
Jane Austen would be ashamed.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.913
I personally...

08:24.296 --> 08:27.381
The girl is pregnant. Very pregnant.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.675
Are we to believe
that she escaped from him?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.260
- What're you getting at?
- Ethan infiltrated us.

08:32.345 --> 08:36.056
Whoever he is and wherever
he comes from, he's intelligent.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.434
- Who's to say he didn't send Claire?
- You're off your head, mate.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.270
Calm down. That's a stretch, Sayid.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.482
Tell me doctor, how many times
have you diagnosed amnesia?

08:45.567 --> 08:48.360
- And such a selective brand of it?
- OK. It's rare.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.904
She's been through a trauma.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.740
It is possible that her memory
reset to the crash.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.119
And the chances of
that memory returning?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.498
- I don't know.
- You know what?

09:01.583 --> 09:04.668
Talk about Claire all you want.
I'm gonna spend time with her.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.254
I get the impression
she might be a tad upset.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.429
Oh, Jin.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.681
You heading back to the caves?

09:21.811 --> 09:23.896
Safety in numbers, right?

09:23.980 --> 09:27.358
Of course, you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.487
How nice it must be to not be involved
in the bloody insanity

09:31.571 --> 09:34.073
that surrounds us at every turn.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.033
It's quite beautiful really.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.910
You take care of your wife.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.663
Everything else
is someone else's problem.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.083
No need to be involved in
the decision making process.

09:44.167 --> 09:47.920
No tree shaking behemoths,
French transmissions.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.464
Just sweet bloody ignorance.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.258
You don't know how lucky you are.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.510
Must be nice, you wake up and...

10:00.517 --> 10:02.142
What?

10:18.535 --> 10:20.703
Charlie, I want her back.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.707
- What?
- I want you to bring her back.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.210
What did you do to her?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.715
What did you do?

10:39.306 --> 10:40.556
You bring her here.

10:42.350 --> 10:46.895
If you don't, I'm going to
kill one of them.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.982
Then if you don't bring her back
before sundown tomorrow?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.817
I'll kill another.

10:51.901 --> 10:57.281
And another.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.616
One every day.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.243
And Charlie,

11:02.912 --> 11:04.913
I'll kill you last.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.477
What do we do?

11:26.561 --> 11:28.645
- We go out and we kill him.
- Calm down.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.647
We don't want the others
to get upset.

11:30.732 --> 11:34.026
- Forget them. He's out there now.
- I think he's right.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.696
The man threatens
to kill one of us, and what?

11:37.781 --> 11:39.698
We just wait for that to happen?

11:39.783 --> 11:42.659
We tracked him once before.
We can track him again.

11:42.744 --> 11:46.038
You've forgotten how that turned out.
He bested you. Physically.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.414
He hung you from a tree.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.709
Running into the jungle is not
gonna get it done.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.462
- So, what does get it done?
- We circle the wagons.

11:53.546 --> 11:57.049
Tell a select few, we post them
as sentries here and at the caves.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.384
"Tell a select few?"

11:59.302 --> 12:02.930
He does what he says he's gonna do
and that blood's on our hands.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.186
OK, Jack, we tell everyone.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.064
But you wanna protect them,
you need to think defense.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.109
We move everybody off the beach
back up into the caves.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.069
What if Ethan isn't alone?

12:18.530 --> 12:21.990
What if he delivered his threat
so that we would gather like sheep

12:22.075 --> 12:26.829
in a space where they could roll in
and take us all in one fell swoop?

12:29.124 --> 12:30.541
OK, John.

12:30.625 --> 12:34.169
I mean, obviously you have a plan,
so let's hear it.

12:59.737 --> 13:03.115
- The others are avoiding me.
- Sorry?

13:03.199 --> 13:05.492
No one will talk to me.

13:05.577 --> 13:09.455
You know, it just feels
like something's going on.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.710
Anything coming back?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.920
After the crash, no.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.548
Some of this stuff
is probably better forgotten.

13:20.383 --> 13:24.344
I don't know about you, but the rest
of us been having a wonderful time.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.098
We even built a golf course.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.688
You sure there's nothing's going on?

13:38.401 --> 13:40.027
Absolutely.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.156
OK.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.539
You're quite enamored of yourself.

13:52.624 --> 13:56.168
Now Lucy, I know it's our first date
and you need to appear demure,

13:56.252 --> 13:58.003
but if you want to invite me for sex,

13:58.087 --> 14:01.757
don't say "tea," say "sex."

14:01.841 --> 14:04.218
- Do you want tea or not?
- I'd love some.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.719
Brilliant.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.180
So where is the old man?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.848
I don't know.

14:09.933 --> 14:13.310
I think he's buying
some paper company up in Slough.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.355
Oh, yeah?

14:16.439 --> 14:17.940
You two get on?

14:18.024 --> 14:20.776
Dad's quite cool, actually.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.738
He was proud when I told him I was going
on a date with a bona fide rock star.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.663
It was Winston Churchill's.

14:34.249 --> 14:38.210
Dad collects all sorts of rubbish from
the great leaders of the Empire.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.046
- Hey, you should meet him.
- Winston? No thanks.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.633
- I heard he's quite moldy.
- My father.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.053
He's coming back tomorrow.
You should come around for dinner.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.223
I'd love to.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.309
Excellent.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.653
You look hungry.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.325
Thanks.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.167
Locke told us what happened.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.007
Why do you think he wants her back?

15:26.676 --> 15:28.343
I don't know.

15:32.849 --> 15:36.935
Maybe it's time you used that key
you've been wearing around your neck.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.896
There are four 9 millimeters
in the case...

15:39.981 --> 15:40.981
No.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.610
I hand them out, someone
hears something, gets scared...

15:44.694 --> 15:47.613
Chance of shooting each other
is higher than shooting him.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.114
We're beyond knives.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.783
I'm not putting guns in untrained hands.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.210
Trip it.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.672
Not bad.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.966
Four around the perimeter
will do the job.

16:08.051 --> 16:11.595
- I have fires at 20 meter intervals.
- Excellent.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.931
Some have volunteered for sentry duty.
I'll put them on shifts.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.058
I'll take a shift.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.310
OK.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.105
Absolutely. We're counting on you.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.074
- Maybe we should move her.
- She's safer here.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.159
What about the mountain? Another cave?

16:34.243 --> 16:37.204
- She's safer here.
- Nobody's safe!

16:41.292 --> 16:43.752
It's my fault he took her.
I was responsible.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.213
I should've taken care of her.
I should've...

16:47.131 --> 16:50.592
Nothing's gonna happen to her. OK?

16:53.221 --> 16:54.429
Yeah. OK.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.194
Well, I think my lovely daughter
would agree that

17:09.278 --> 17:14.031
you are the most impressive person
who's ever had dinner with us.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.951
My condolences, sir.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.871
I don't know if Lucy mentioned it,
but I was in a band once, you know.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.709
They were called
The Protestant Reformation.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.377
Yes. Ouch! Dreadful.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.713
You gave it up, then?

17:27.797 --> 17:30.465
Well, I was married,
Lucy was on the way.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.218
My mum, God rest her soul,
wanted me to keep trying,

17:33.302 --> 17:36.596
but I always wanted
to be more practical.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.015
Responsible, I guess.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.519
You know, a man has to provide,
take care of his family.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.688
A man has to think about the future.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.898
And of course,
your band was bloody awful.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.401
Yes, there was that too. Small detail.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.486
So, are you working on a new album?

17:53.364 --> 17:55.657
We're in a bit of a hiatus right now.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.247
Liam, my brother, just had a daughter,

18:02.331 --> 18:06.501
so, you know,
we're taking some time off.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.383
Quite a lot of time off.

18:13.468 --> 18:17.179
It's been a year since we were together.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.059
I'm thinking of doing a solo project.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.438
Liam and I don't exactly keep in touch

18:26.522 --> 18:31.026
and there's been some problems with...

18:31.110 --> 18:32.944
...royalties.

18:37.867 --> 18:41.453
The fact of the matter is, sir,

18:41.537 --> 18:44.289
I think that Drive Shaft

18:44.373 --> 18:47.042
might be dead.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.467
- You took a sodding what?
- A job.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.718
A job? Doing what?

18:59.472 --> 19:02.182
- Selling copiers.
- You took a job selling copiers?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.434
- I like her.
- She's a moose.

19:04.519 --> 19:07.479
- Don't say that.
- Are you off your bleeding chump, man?!

19:07.563 --> 19:10.816
I've been getting you off on my scag
for over a week now on spec.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.443
- Spec means "speculation."
- Yes, I know what...

19:13.528 --> 19:17.322
In this case, the speculation that
you'll execute your end of the plan

19:17.406 --> 19:20.492
and steal something of value
which I can in turn sell.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.911
By the time the bird
realizes it's missing,

19:22.995 --> 19:27.165
it never even occurs to her
the rock star Charlie bloody Pace

19:27.250 --> 19:31.253
could be responsible for such larceny.
And the bloody party continues.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.632
Look...

19:37.134 --> 19:40.178
I don't think Liam's coming back.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.430
- I have to think about my future.
- Future?

19:42.515 --> 19:43.515
- Yeah.
- Really?

19:43.599 --> 19:46.142
- Yes.
- When do you start this job?

19:46.227 --> 19:49.187
- Monday.
- Well, today's Friday, isn't it?

19:49.272 --> 19:53.316
A full weekend without a fix,
Monday should be bloody wonderful.

19:53.401 --> 19:56.862
Let's see how the future
treats you then.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.165
Over here.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.210
In the tree line.
Something tripped the alarm.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.891
I think we found
another missing castaway.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.317
- What happened?
- Is he alive?

21:59.402 --> 22:01.820
- Oh, God.
- How did he get past us?

22:17.753 --> 22:21.381
I thought those guys had
the full-on perimeter set up.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.924
Locke said it didn't matter.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.927
He came in from the water.

22:30.016 --> 22:34.102
You sure it wasn't an accident?
I mean, maybe the guy just drowned.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.981
His neck was broken. Both arms.
All the bones in his fingers.

22:38.065 --> 22:41.443
Yeah. OK. Got it.

22:43.404 --> 22:46.197
Guess old Steve drew the short straw.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.409
Dude, that was Scott.

23:01.797 --> 23:05.633
Scott Jackson worked for
an Internet company in Santa Cruz.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.136
He won a sales prize.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.347
Two-week Australian vacation,
all expenses paid.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.434
He was a good guy.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.063
I'm sorry I kept
calling you Steve, man.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.944
Amen, I guess.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.280
I don't know how to end these.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.882
Hi.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.510
Why is everyone staring at me?

23:49.470 --> 23:52.180
- I'm not staring at you.
- What's your name?

23:53.641 --> 23:56.643
- Shannon.
- You're staring.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.941
- You mean nobody's told you?
- Told me what?

24:05.194 --> 24:08.446
Why? Why did you lie to me?

24:08.531 --> 24:11.116
- OK, look...
- What else didn't you tell me?

24:12.118 --> 24:14.786
I thought there wasn't
anything that you could do.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.329
Nothing I could do?

24:18.374 --> 24:21.042
Why would you keep me in the dark?

24:22.211 --> 24:23.962
I'm already in the dark.

24:25.339 --> 24:26.881
Sorry.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.135
I just wanted to take care of you.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.470
I can take care of myself.

24:41.105 --> 24:45.733
Look at you. Charlie Pace,
respectable businessman.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.069
You didn't have to buy me this suit.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.406
What did you intend
on wearing for your first day?

24:52.032 --> 24:55.326
I have shirts with buttons.

24:56.579 --> 25:00.081
- You OK?
- Yeah, just nervous.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.125
Don't be. Dad's put the fix in.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.420
He's demanded they buy two copiers
to boost your confidence.

25:09.717 --> 25:13.887
- You memorized the manual?
- Backwards and forwards.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.056
Say something impressive.

25:20.477 --> 25:25.398
The Heatherton C815
Copy Center's leading scan offerings

25:25.482 --> 25:28.193
combine the benefits of document capture

25:28.277 --> 25:32.864
with instant delivery anywhere, anytime.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.533
- Anywhere?
- Anytime, baby.

25:36.827 --> 25:40.371
You've been on stage in front
of thousands of screaming fans.

25:40.456 --> 25:43.666
This is just some men who want
to buy a silly copy machine.

25:43.751 --> 25:47.170
You're gonna do great. I believe in you.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.882
I almost forgot. Wait here.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.300
OK.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.650
All right, I know you'll protest,

26:08.734 --> 26:12.111
but you simply can't be respected
unless you have one of these.

26:12.655 --> 26:15.448
Oh, Lucy.

26:17.159 --> 26:18.868
You're welcome.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.579
OK, well...

26:21.664 --> 26:23.623
I'm gonna be late. The bus...

26:23.707 --> 26:25.583
The bus? Are you daft?

26:25.668 --> 26:28.753
- I'm driving you.
- Oh, no, I'd rather you didn't.

26:28.837 --> 26:32.090
No arguments.
You have everything you need?

26:33.592 --> 26:36.302
- Yeah.
- Then let's get you to work.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.189
Wanna take a walk?

26:51.026 --> 26:52.735
What happens after the sun sets?

26:52.820 --> 26:55.571
Well, if we don't bring Claire to him?

26:55.656 --> 26:57.282
Rhetorical, Jack.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.951
Same thing happens tonight
happened last night.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.412
- You think you can track him?
- What, I'm sorry?

27:02.496 --> 27:04.622
We know where
he attacked Jin and Charlie.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.624
You think you could pick up the trail?

27:06.709 --> 27:09.043
- Maybe, but I wouldn't.
- Wouldn't?

27:10.713 --> 27:13.923
Jack, I'm not a cold man.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.800
I feel for the loss of one of our own.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.802
But nothing fundamental's changed.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.139
Whoever he is, wherever he comes from,
we're on Ethan's turf.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.640
He has the advantage.

27:22.725 --> 27:26.894
To him we're nothing more than
scared idiots with sharp sticks.

27:29.106 --> 27:32.358
What if I told you that I had
a way to get the advantage back?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.737
Then I would ask,
"What way might that be?"

28:03.766 --> 28:06.100
Why, doctor,
you've been holding out on us.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.608
I'm guessing you know
how to handle one of these?

28:34.922 --> 28:36.381
Are you insane?

28:36.465 --> 28:39.550
- It's the best chance we have.
- No bloody way.

28:39.635 --> 28:42.595
To capture Ethan we have
to ensnare him. The only way to do it

28:42.679 --> 28:45.431
- is by giving him what he wants.
- You have no idea.

28:45.516 --> 28:48.017
This guy, he will kill all of you.

28:48.102 --> 28:50.061
You can't protect yourself...

28:50.145 --> 28:51.896
I can talk for myself.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.733
They want to use you as bait.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.904
I don't remember Ethan.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.657
I don't remember what he did to me.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.743
But if I can help stop him
from hurting anyone else,

29:05.828 --> 29:07.328
I have to do that.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.582
I'm coming with you.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.584
You said there were four guns.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.878
You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?

29:23.804 --> 29:25.513
All right, we should do this.

29:25.973 --> 29:30.143
Let's figure out a game plan.
All right, Sayid, soldier.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.270
Locke, you're the hunter.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.939
Allow me to demonstrate
the awesome speed

29:35.023 --> 29:37.442
of the C815 using...

29:38.110 --> 29:40.278
...one of your...

29:40.362 --> 29:43.531
...technical manuals.

29:58.046 --> 30:02.675
Not a problem.
There's probably... something in here.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.225
One second. One second.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.227
Bear with me.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.162
Charlie's right.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.789
About what?

30:33.874 --> 30:37.460
We have four guns.
We should have four men.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.341
Help?

30:45.511 --> 30:47.845
You know how to handle a gun or not?

30:47.930 --> 30:50.515
I know at least one
polar bear seems to think so.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.941
Where'd you get the hardware, hoss?

31:02.110 --> 31:03.277
I wanna come.

31:04.071 --> 31:05.363
Sorry. We're out of guns.

31:05.447 --> 31:08.282
And no one goes out there unarmed.

31:09.243 --> 31:11.744
How much ammo you got?

31:15.082 --> 31:18.125
- Hundred rounds, give or take.
- All nines right?

31:19.628 --> 31:21.671
Nine millimeters? The guns?

31:21.755 --> 31:23.381
Yeah. Why?

31:23.465 --> 31:26.425
'Cause if the lady wants to come...

31:32.182 --> 31:35.142
Lifted this off the marshal
back in the old days.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.728
You remember him, don't you?

31:37.813 --> 31:41.232
Surly guy, kind of a square jaw?
Carried a Sig nine?

31:41.316 --> 31:44.652
Yeah. I remember you shot him.
And missed.

31:45.696 --> 31:48.656
Yeah, well... bygones.

31:50.867 --> 31:54.161
And hell, five guns
are better than four.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.431
You'll be surrounded at five points.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.433
Everyone will be in visual contact.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.644
Make sure you stay
in the area I've shown you.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.189
And remember, the guns are
a measure of the last resort.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.650
We want him alive.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.335
Over here.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.465
Jack's got him.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.429
Hold your fire. Don't shoot!

34:58.513 --> 35:00.264
We want him alive.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.694
- You all right?
- Yeah.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.448
Over here.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.742
- Hey! Hold your fire!
- Easy!

35:36.551 --> 35:39.470
Winner by a knockout. Nice one, doc.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.723
Maybe somebody can tell me
who or what this son of a bitch is.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.520
Jungle boy, not even for one sec.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.082
Why did you do it?

36:54.421 --> 36:56.714
'Cause he deserved to die.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.595
He could've told us where he came from.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.430
What he wanted with Claire.

37:04.514 --> 37:07.308
Do you really think
he would've told us anything?

37:11.855 --> 37:15.900
I wasn't gonna let that animal
anywhere near her again.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.235
Ever.

37:40.008 --> 37:42.676
I'm sorry.
I've been having some problems.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.929
- If I could just explain.
- Leave.

37:47.182 --> 37:50.434
- I made a mistake.
- You made a mistake?

37:50.518 --> 37:52.811
My father's sales manager
comes to my house

37:52.896 --> 37:55.898
to return a cigarette case
the EMTs pulled from your pocket

37:55.982 --> 37:58.859
at the bloody hospital
and it still smells of your sick.

38:00.487 --> 38:03.280
- I didn't mean...
- Oh, you meant to.

38:03.365 --> 38:06.450
You meant to from the start.
You're a liar.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.285
I believed you and you lied!

38:08.370 --> 38:10.788
I thought you wanted to...

38:10.872 --> 38:12.998
You said...

38:13.083 --> 38:15.042
You selfish bastard!

38:15.126 --> 38:17.628
- If I can just explain...
- Just tell me one thing,

38:17.712 --> 38:19.755
and don't you dare lie to me.

38:19.839 --> 38:23.008
I get why you pretended to like me.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.970
I understand why you stole,

38:26.054 --> 38:28.347
because you're a junkie,

38:30.892 --> 38:34.311
but I don't understand
why you took the job.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.774
Why did you take the job?

38:44.072 --> 38:47.741
I guess I...

38:52.080 --> 38:54.748
...wanted to be respectable.

38:58.712 --> 39:01.839
I wanted you to think
that I could take care of you.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.177
You'll never take care of anyone.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.433
I remember peanut butter.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.646
Why do I remember peanut butter?

40:04.152 --> 40:07.321
It was imaginary
peanut butter, actually.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.161
I don't know what happened to me.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.376
I'm scared.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.677
I want to trust you.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.273
Good night, Charlie.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.193
Good night, Claire.
