WEBVTT

00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:27.777 --> 00:28.987
Woohoo!

00:29.070 --> 00:30.947
Wahoo!

00:31.030 --> 00:32.782
Woohoo!

00:32.866 --> 00:35.493
Last one to the movie premiere
buys everyone snacks!

00:42.500 --> 00:45.712
Alright, my very first race
with my new license!

00:45.795 --> 00:46.963


00:47.046 --> 00:49.632
You're all about to
get minivanned!

00:52.343 --> 00:54.888
Hm. Let's see what we got going on.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.405
Sissy, if you wanted
to ride with a winner,

01:12.489 --> 01:14.324
you should have come with me.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.868
-Nice one!

01:23.541 --> 01:26.836
I-I know this is your first race,
so I'll go easy on you.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.380
Aw, that's so thoughtful of you.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.844
Hey! What the heck?

01:34.928 --> 01:37.388
I made some upgrades.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.057
Okay, that's it!

01:49.692 --> 01:53.238
Ha! Thanks for going easy on me!

02:02.622 --> 02:04.958
Who's winning now?

02:05.041 --> 02:06.543
Me! That's who!

02:06.626 --> 02:08.670
Pretty great, right?

02:09.212 --> 02:11.965
I think I like you better
as a strong, silent type.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.342
Hold on, we're taking a shortcut.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.347
Whoa!

02:20.765 --> 02:23.768
-Are you ready for an LA river flume ride?
-Yeah!

02:27.272 --> 02:29.399
Ah, man! My paint job!

02:30.859 --> 02:31.985
Hang on!

02:43.746 --> 02:45.123
You're good!

03:10.982 --> 03:13.234
Oh my gosh,
is that Layla Gray? Layla!

03:13.318 --> 03:14.903
-Over here!
-Layla!

03:17.780 --> 03:21.868
That's right, that's right,
it's me from the movie!

03:21.951 --> 03:25.788
"Yeah, you must have been
a great shortstop in Little League."

03:25.872 --> 03:27.957
"Now where's the cash?"

03:28.041 --> 03:30.001
-Yeah, that's my line!

03:30.084 --> 03:32.629
Keep an eye out for it!
It's going to be on the screen!

03:33.212 --> 03:35.757
Right here!
Hold it, beautiful. Got it!

03:38.343 --> 03:39.594
Layla!

03:41.971 --> 03:44.515
-You really know how to make an entrance.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.893
-Who are your friends?
-I'm Frostee Benson.

03:46.976 --> 03:50.730
It's such an honor to meet you.
I love everything about the Limo movies.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.608
You are amazing!

03:53.691 --> 03:54.525
Thank you.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.027
It's always nice to meet a fan

03:56.110 --> 03:58.613
and to know that my work
has enriched someone's life.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.199
It truly, truly has.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.618
But, I do have some notes.

04:03.701 --> 04:07.121
For one, what's with the title:
<i>Limo 3: The Stretchening</i>?

04:07.205 --> 04:09.791
Because to me, what makes Limo
such a relatable character

04:09.874 --> 04:11.918
is that he's a little car
with a big heart.

04:12.001 --> 04:15.088
In the first Limo, the chauffeur
finds him in the junkyard and says,

04:15.171 --> 04:18.091
"You got a big heart
for such a little car."

04:18.174 --> 04:20.551
So if you're implying
he needs to be bigger, that's--

04:20.635 --> 04:23.471
Uh, yeah… Oh, they need me.

04:23.554 --> 04:26.224
I'll catch up later. Much later.

04:28.851 --> 04:32.355
-Well, look who it is.
-Dom!

04:32.438 --> 04:34.649
-What are you doing here?

04:35.233 --> 04:37.402
I know every driver in this town.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.363
I gave half the people
in this movie their first start.

04:40.905 --> 04:45.034
I heard what you kids did,
how you saved LA.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.828
I'm proud of you all.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.623
Thanks, Dom. That means everything to us.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.625
You okay?

04:53.793 --> 04:57.005
I guess I'm just trying to figure out
my life now that I'm not a spy.

04:57.588 --> 05:00.925
Being a spy is just part of who you are.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.135
But you're a leader.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.723
You're the head of that family.
That's who you'll always be.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.266
Thanks.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.518
So you're the famous Dom Toretto.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.896
-That depends. Who's asking?

05:14.397 --> 05:17.567
Sissy Benson, and I have a few questions,
if you don't mind.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.862
Fire away, Ms. Benson.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.825
Where do you live?
Did you really win a car race in reverse?

05:25.908 --> 05:29.662
What do you prefer: unicorns or mermaids?
What mods do you have on your 440?

05:30.246 --> 05:33.249
Whoa, slow down, kid.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.960
You're gonna make
an excellent member of the team someday.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.260
We're here. Do you think
if we get this over with soon enough,

05:44.343 --> 05:45.762
we can make it to the premiere?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.847
<i>We're two hours out of the city!</i>

05:48.431 --> 05:53.895
We could take a helicopter.
I fly, you buy the popcorn.

05:53.978 --> 05:58.066
Guys, our agency inadvertently
created the world's greatest threat.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.652
Our job tonight is to make sure
it can never harm anyone ever again.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.573
-We're not going to the premiere.
-Aw…

06:15.917 --> 06:17.335
Load her in.

06:31.599 --> 06:36.771
You must have been
a great shortstop in Little League.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.440
Now where's the cash?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.442
-Look at Cisco!

06:42.110 --> 06:44.946
-Yeah, that's me, that's me!
-Great line.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.115
Sh! I'm trying to figure out
what's going on.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.616
Who's that guy?

06:48.699 --> 06:53.121
That's the chauffeur - the hero.
The car is his cyborg sidekick.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.997
The limo is part human?!

06:55.581 --> 07:00.211
<i>We've been through so much.</i>
<i>We've brought so many people home.</i>

07:01.170 --> 07:02.755
<i>Now we're going home.</i>

07:06.926 --> 07:11.848
<i>Ah, that's right, Limo.</i>
<i>This is gonna be our final ride.</i>

07:12.431 --> 07:15.560
Some of these lines are so cheesy!

07:15.643 --> 07:17.478
Yeah. Cheesy.

07:17.562 --> 07:21.107
I think I got some popcorn
in my eye. I'll be right back.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.158
Are those more Danns?

07:30.658 --> 07:32.410
Don't worry about them.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.913
They're super soldiers like Dann,
but they never got the AI upgrade she has.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.542
We're removing their enhancements today
and shutting down the entire program.

07:40.543 --> 07:44.839
-Alright, I finally get to use this thing!

07:44.922 --> 07:47.842
-But… I…

07:47.925 --> 07:49.594
-Gary!

07:49.677 --> 07:52.138
How do I use this thing?
What happened to the controls?

07:52.221 --> 07:55.850
Oh, the agency has been
upgrading their platforms!

07:55.933 --> 07:57.810
This runs on the new scheduling software.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.981
This is so great!
It's constantly learning and predicting.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.525
It's like it knows what I'm thinking
before I think it!

08:04.609 --> 08:06.569
I wish you were more like that.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.571
I can predict what you're thinking.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.908
Oh. That is not nice.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.952
-Just finish programming this thing!
-Okay, let's see here…

08:15.036 --> 08:17.288
Scheduling cybernetic update protocol.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.291
We want the lasers to open up
a pathway to Dann's neural network,

08:20.374 --> 08:22.001
not incinerate her.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.130
It's actually very interesting

08:26.214 --> 08:30.426
how laser technology formerly used
to destroy is now a medical marvel.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.973
Some of us want to
enrich our lives with knowledge.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.561
Fine. It's ready.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.818
Everyone, get a safe distance away.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.197
Uh, I thought you said
those lasers weren't set to incinerate.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.782
Well…

08:59.789 --> 09:02.083
-Okay, what now?

09:02.166 --> 09:04.585
That's weird. The software seems glitchy.

09:08.172 --> 09:11.842
No, it's not a holiday.
How many September birthdays are there?!

09:11.926 --> 09:15.096
It's like it's actually trying to stop us
from wiping Dann's software!

09:15.680 --> 09:17.932
Hold up. This scheduling software…

09:18.015 --> 09:21.018
Is this the same AI software
that was uploaded into Dann?

09:21.102 --> 09:23.229
Well, an early version of it,

09:23.312 --> 09:26.274
but Dann's AI mutated over time
and started to think on its own.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.818
This one is basically
a glorified calendar.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.951
-Take cover!

09:40.788 --> 09:43.624
-That is one angry calendar!
-What's happening?

09:43.708 --> 09:46.002
The AI program won't destroy itself!

09:47.712 --> 09:50.965
Oh, no. The AI
is uploading itself into those soldiers!

09:52.383 --> 09:53.509
Not good!

10:21.954 --> 10:24.040
It's alive!

10:49.732 --> 10:52.652
I know I'm never supposed to ask
who I'm transporting,

10:52.735 --> 10:53.903
but this is different.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.198
You're right.

10:57.281 --> 11:02.036
I made a vow I wouldn't do this,
but now I gotta break it.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.621
[suspenseful music plays

11:11.962 --> 11:14.507
<i>-What?! Cars don't ride in cars!</i>

11:14.590 --> 11:17.551
-Mm. This is getting good.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.262
Amazing!

11:20.346 --> 11:22.390
-Ugh.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.314
I think your girlfriend's
looking for you in there.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.818
You know, Sissy.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.113
It was a joke, Toretto.

11:38.030 --> 11:42.159
I-I know Dom's right, and I'm still an
awesome leader you all love and respect…

11:42.243 --> 11:44.453
He didn't say that, exactly.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.081
But I loved being a spy!

11:47.164 --> 11:51.001
I-I don't want to give that up.
I mean, w-what are you gonna do now?

11:51.585 --> 11:54.255
Me? I'll probably open a sandwich shop.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.714
-Really?!
-No!

11:55.798 --> 11:57.675
I'm gonna keep street racing.

11:57.758 --> 12:01.053
Nothing brings me joy
like embarrassing punks like you.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.764
First of all,
you've never embarrassed me, okay?

12:03.848 --> 12:07.184
And second of all, I-I-I…

12:07.268 --> 12:08.978
I don't have a second thing.

12:09.562 --> 12:13.399
Toretto, I think you just need to
accept that some things change,

12:13.482 --> 12:15.860
but me beating you will always remain.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.405
-That's it, we're racing right now.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.157
Hook, line and sinker!

12:23.993 --> 12:26.120
We gotta stop her
from getting those weapons!

12:26.203 --> 12:28.622
If we don't destroy
the original AI software,

12:28.706 --> 12:30.332
it won't matter what we do to Dann!

12:30.416 --> 12:32.251
It'll infect everything in the agency!

12:52.271 --> 12:54.315
That software's being stored here.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.692
Everyone, fall back! Go after them!

12:56.775 --> 12:58.569
I'll handle the AI.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.039
-Schedule this!

13:19.590 --> 13:20.424
-Echo.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.263
That's one calendar down.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.807
Oh, thank goodness.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.809
Now, get in! They're getting away.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.252
Someone get us unhooked!

14:11.642 --> 14:13.811
Get ready to bail. We're going down.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.606
-We're out of here!

14:24.196 --> 14:26.615
-Any chance they didn't make it?

14:31.412 --> 14:32.955
Of course not.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.837
Gary, call the base and tell them
to send a ride, and get ahold of Tony.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.965
Let him know that Dann and
two super soldiers are headed to LA.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.216
What are you doing?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.719
I'm going after that one.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.894
Okay, first to the garage wins. You ready?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.061
I was born ready.

14:56.145 --> 14:56.979
-Huh?

14:58.105 --> 14:59.398
<i>Tony, are you there?!</i>

14:59.481 --> 15:01.358
Gary? What's wrong?

15:01.442 --> 15:03.736
<i>Okay, so good news and bad news.</i>

15:03.819 --> 15:07.907
<i>The bad news is Dann is awake and heading</i>
<i>to LA with two other super soldiers.</i>

15:07.990 --> 15:10.492
Wait, wait, wait. There's more than one?!

15:10.576 --> 15:12.912
<i>Yeah, but the good news is</i>
<i>we can track them</i>

15:12.995 --> 15:14.872
<i>through their high-intensity explosives.</i>

15:14.955 --> 15:16.373
They have bombs?!

15:20.127 --> 15:21.879
So, change of plans then?

15:21.962 --> 15:23.464
Let's go find those things.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.805
Come on, pick up… Pick up…

15:46.820 --> 15:49.365
Limo, hold on a little longer!

15:49.448 --> 15:51.492
I need to disable that bomb!

16:02.544 --> 16:06.465
OMG. The stretchening!

16:15.849 --> 16:16.850
There they are.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.644
And I beat Layla.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.483
Oh, sorry, Toretto!
Looks like I win again!

16:24.566 --> 16:25.985
Oh, come on!

16:28.487 --> 16:30.531
Layla, we're gonna have to call a truce.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.574
Why? Because you're losing?!

16:32.658 --> 16:34.868
<i>Because Los Angeles</i>
<i>is under attack!</i>

16:35.703 --> 16:36.745
Whatever you say.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.678
-<i>Toretto, what's going on?</i>
-I'm tailing Dann. Where are you?

16:52.761 --> 16:55.222
<i>We're in a helicopter</i>
<i>about ten minutes out.</i>

16:55.305 --> 16:56.807
<i>Don't let them out of your sight.</i>

16:56.890 --> 16:59.727
Working on that.
What are they trying to do, anyway?

16:59.810 --> 17:03.564
<i>No clue. It doesn't matter,</i>
<i>it's something bad. It's always bad!</i>

17:03.647 --> 17:04.565
Any bright ideas?

17:04.648 --> 17:07.109
I think I may be able to get close.
How 'bout you?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.862
If you can do it, so can I.
What are you thinking?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.071
High low?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.489
Just like old times!

17:35.137 --> 17:36.847
They're on foot and splitting up!

17:39.975 --> 17:40.893
I see Dann!

17:41.477 --> 17:43.896
Looks like
I'm gonna get there first!

17:43.979 --> 17:45.439
I thought we called a truce!

17:45.522 --> 17:47.024
Truce over!

17:47.107 --> 17:49.401
See you at the next stop, Toretto.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.400
I'll survive. How about you?

18:44.540 --> 18:45.833
Huh?

19:17.614 --> 19:20.159
<i>Layla, I could use</i>
<i>a little help down here.</i>

19:20.242 --> 19:24.037
Well look, you got to Dann first, so
I thought I'd let you enjoy your victory.

19:25.497 --> 19:29.501
I'm on a runaway train
and she's trying to kill me!

19:30.002 --> 19:31.795
So dramatic!

19:41.388 --> 19:42.598
What are you up to?

19:49.980 --> 19:51.231
The fault line.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.867
No!

20:18.759 --> 20:21.011
-You want it?

20:22.095 --> 20:23.972
It's all yours!

20:34.274 --> 20:37.778
-Hello? Hello?

20:37.861 --> 20:39.238
Does anyone copy?

20:39.321 --> 20:41.281
Dann is enacting her old plan.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.743
<i>She's trying to trigger an</i>
<i>earthquake and send LA into the ocean!</i>

20:44.826 --> 20:47.621
<i>They've already set off one explosive!</i>

20:48.121 --> 20:51.416
Look. Here's the fault line,
and here's the train Tony's currently on.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.669
Where do they intersect?

20:54.211 --> 20:57.214
Toretto,
you gotta stop that train!

20:57.297 --> 20:59.591
<i>It's headed</i>
<i>straight for Hollywood!</i>

21:26.994 --> 21:29.204
Thanks for saving me.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.791
I haven't saved you yet.
Get in! We gotta stop that train.

21:41.967 --> 21:42.801
No!

21:52.811 --> 21:56.064
-Where's Dann?
-Look.

21:59.609 --> 22:05.240
Welcome to
LA's last day, Toretto.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.491
Run!

22:38.356 --> 22:40.275
