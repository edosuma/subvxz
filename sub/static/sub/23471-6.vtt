WEBVTT

00:05.547 --> 00:07.424
I am crushing it.

00:07.507 --> 00:11.302
I've never played so well.
I am burying you.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.223
You realize
you're the top half of the screen?

00:15.306 --> 00:16.933
No!

00:18.393 --> 00:20.937
Ah! I'm glad you're here, Schneider.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.566
Finally.
I knew I'd hear those words one day.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.569
The lights in the laundry room
are out still.

00:27.652 --> 00:30.655
I don't know whose bra this is,
but she has a wild side, and I'm into it.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.616
Can you do some work for once?

00:33.700 --> 00:35.744
Ah, what's the point?

00:35.827 --> 00:38.371
I change a light bulb.
A year later, I gotta change it again.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.123
I mean, what are we doing here?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.042
That's mine.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.463
Anyway, I'll fix the lights.
I gotta call my guy, Butch.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.464
So, do that.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.965
Don't micromanage me!

00:51.468 --> 00:56.139
What you need to do is to study with me
for our citizenship tests.

00:56.222 --> 01:00.685
Are you going to sit on that couch,
eating junk food, watching TV all day?

01:00.769 --> 01:02.520
Or are you going to be an American?

01:06.274 --> 01:09.110
Please. I'm very patriotic.
Look in that basket.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.570
There's a bald eagle thong.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.826
Check me out!

01:16.910 --> 01:18.703
Oh...

01:18.787 --> 01:21.790
Sweet kicks,  papito.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.751
Abuelita,  take a picture for my Insta.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.629
Gonna stare this way so it doesn't look
like I know you're doing it.

01:27.712 --> 01:31.007
-Okay. Okay.
-[phone camera shutter clicking]

01:34.636 --> 01:35.678
[chuckles]

01:36.721 --> 01:37.889
[chuckles]

01:37.972 --> 01:40.475
What's going on
south of your ankles, buddy?

01:40.558 --> 01:42.769
Aren't those the expensive sneakers
I said you couldn't have?

01:43.853 --> 01:46.272
They were a gift from an admirer.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.073
Mami...

01:55.740 --> 01:58.159
I can spend my money how I want to.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.661
How about contributing to the rent?

01:59.744 --> 02:01.788
I'm a senior! I'm on a fixed income!

02:03.915 --> 02:06.751
Mami,  I'm trying to teach Alex
the value of a dollar.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.962
You need to pay for those
or send them back.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.590
-I thought you wanted to get a summer job.
-Ah, what's the point?

02:12.674 --> 02:16.136
I get some money, I spend some money.
I mean, what are we doing here?

02:17.762 --> 02:18.680
Preach.

02:20.014 --> 02:23.393
Alex, those shoes stay in your closet
until you find a way to pay  Abuelita  back.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.311
Okay. Fine.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.818
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh...

02:31.901 --> 02:34.445
[deep inhale] Your debt is forgiven.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.822
[both chuckle]

02:35.905 --> 02:37.657
Stop pampering him!

02:37.740 --> 02:39.284
Scott and Lori are on vacation.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.162
Dr. Berkowitz needs somebody
in the office to help with filing.

02:42.245 --> 02:48.126
Oh... But if he goes to work with you,
I barely get to see him.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.712
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.716
-You start tomorrow.
-[sighs] You're so unfair!

02:57.093 --> 02:58.595
Alex seems very upset.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.388
I'm gonna buy him something.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.393
[laughs]

03:06.019 --> 03:07.729
What are you laughing at, freeloader?

03:07.812 --> 03:10.523
'Cause I'm pretty sure
I told you three times already

03:10.607 --> 03:11.816
you need to get a summer job.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.320
Yeah, I know. And that is why I got one.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.487
You did?

03:16.571 --> 03:18.197
Just hear me out.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.533
I started my own channel on Twitch.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.578
It's a site where you make money
when people watch you play video games.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.750
[laughs]

03:28.833 --> 03:29.792
Oh, my God.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.253
You had me there for a second. You did.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.381
No, no, no, no. It's a real thing.
It's like what they say,

03:35.465 --> 03:37.508
"Do what you love,
and the money will follow."

03:37.592 --> 03:41.512
Ay,  baby. That's for rich white ladies
who want to make jewelry.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.853
No, no. Penelope, this could be huge.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.605
Hey, can I be your unpaid intern?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.858
-What are your qualifications?
-This is all my stuff.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.860
-You're hired!
-Yes!

03:56.569 --> 03:58.238
Elena, you need to get a real job.

03:58.321 --> 04:02.867
One where you sweat, get blisters,
wear an ill-fitting polyester uniform.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.035
Those things don't breathe!

04:05.036 --> 04:05.870
[Lydia] Yeah.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.290
Listen, when I was your age,
I had three jobs.

04:09.374 --> 04:13.044
Courier, seamstress
and I sold Avon door-to-door.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.045
[Penelope] Thank you.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.422
When I was your age,
I was scooping ice cream.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.548
By the end of the summer,

04:17.632 --> 04:20.718
my right arm looked like Popeye,
the left one looked like Olive Oyl.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.515
Then I joined the army. Almost died.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.683
Get a job.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.061
All right. Mom, look. I have a plan.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.604
If I get 1,000 subscribers,

04:31.688 --> 04:34.399
I'll make more than I would doing
any minimum wage job.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.817
Just give me a chance.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.112
Okay.

04:39.195 --> 04:44.117
I do like that you are showing initiative,
so I'm gonna give you one week.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.662
Thank you, Mom. Come on.
We better get back to work.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.125
We're all going to hell.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.461
[theme song playing]

05:43.509 --> 05:44.635
Thanks, Doc.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.555
This is gonna be great for him and for me.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.558
I loved the summer I worked with my  papi.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.394
On the drive home,
we'd have these long talks,

05:53.478 --> 05:55.438
and they were the closest times
we ever had.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.734
When I go out with my daughters,
they make me follow in a separate cab.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.451
Alex, you are about to see your mom
in action.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.829
She is the best at what she does
and commands respect.

06:11.913 --> 06:12.872
Here's my urine.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.208
Okay, sir.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.920
Penelope, thanks again for squeezing me in
on short notice.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.714
Money's tight and it was great
not to miss a day of work.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.799
Ugh. I hear ya.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.301
Oh! This is right out of the oven.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.761
[laughs]

06:26.844 --> 06:28.846
So, we talked about your protein levels.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.849
-I'll call, soon as I get the results.
-Thank you.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.728
If every nurse were more like you,
people wouldn't hate going to the doctor.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.314
You're just saying that
so I give you a lollipop.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.691
-And here you go.
-[chuckles]

06:43.945 --> 06:44.946
Ha!

06:45.029 --> 06:48.116
You hear that,  papito?
I got followers in real life.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.534
[laughs]

06:50.535 --> 06:51.536
Papito?

06:53.412 --> 06:54.664
Come on!

06:55.832 --> 06:57.708
You are missing all the action.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.920
That guy just said
I am the Beyoncé of nurses.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.049
Okay, but I made a really good playlist.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.218
It's all songs with "boy" in the title.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.972
So I can remember how innocent I was
before you forced me to work here.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.391
Heh.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.269
When we're at work, we work.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.396
This is not a dance party.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.190
[singing in Spanish]

07:28.281 --> 07:29.740
[laughs] What are you doing here?

07:29.824 --> 07:32.618
Well, you left so quickly this morning

07:32.702 --> 07:37.540
that I didn't have a chance
to spritz  papito  with  violetas.

07:37.623 --> 07:41.377
No, no,  Mami.  This is a doctor's office.
You cannot be spraying that.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.090
Ah, damn it. Hit me.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.932
[sniffs] I thought I smelled your mother.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.937
Oh, I feel so proud of
my little genius  doctorcito.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.149
Hi, Lydia.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.776
Oh! Hi, Leslie. I forgot you work here.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.028
[chuckles]

08:07.111 --> 08:08.613
Don't mind me.

08:08.696 --> 08:12.366
I just brought  papito
a working man's lunch.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.912
So, we got a roast beef sandwich,

08:15.995 --> 08:17.914
a ham sandwich,

08:18.706 --> 08:20.500
a turkey sandwich,

08:21.334 --> 08:24.003
half of a rotisserie chicken,

08:25.171 --> 08:28.132
the other half of the rotisserie chicken

08:28.966 --> 08:32.512
and a whoopie pie. [chuckles]

08:33.012 --> 08:35.806
-What'd you bring me?
-Here is yogurt and some rouge.

08:37.725 --> 08:38.684
Siéntate.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.729
It's so good that your mother is here.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.191
You know, now, maybe, she could watch me
do my thang.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.569
You're not gonna start
with the magic tricks, are you?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.738
No, practicing medicine.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.492
I've been a little bit on edge
about our "relationship."

08:54.575 --> 08:57.537
-Why'd you put that in quotes?
-She asked me to.

08:59.247 --> 09:02.917
I get it. I was hoping
Alex could see me do my thang, too.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.336
But so far
it's just been cold cuts and hot pee.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.923
No, no, I get it.
If someone would just drop dead

09:09.006 --> 09:13.010
and I could revive them in front of her,
really give her a show!

09:14.595 --> 09:17.473
Papito,  there is mustard on your chin.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.352
Oh? Does someone need a napkin?

09:21.435 --> 09:22.436
No.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.367
So, how was your day? Wanna talk?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.661
Nah, I'm good.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.998
Come on, it was your first day on the job.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.835
What was the most interesting thing
that happened?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.088
I saw a folder for a guy
named David Davids.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.965
That was kind of weird.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.927
What? That's hilarious! [laughs]

09:56.137 --> 09:59.098
Actually, Mr. Davids passed away.
We should probably shred that file.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.645
Anything else you took away from today?

10:06.314 --> 10:09.984
Yeah. It must be hard to be a nurse.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.487
It is.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.448
It's so boring!

10:15.531 --> 10:19.577
So much of your day is shining a light
in people's noses and filling out forms.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.913
It's like you're an accountant
who also has to look at boogers.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.752
I don't know how you do this every day.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.047
Yeah, you can put the headphones back on.

10:33.716 --> 10:38.346
This is Blanquita16, and we are
about to get started playing in VR mode.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.349
So as you can see,
the graphics are amazing.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.559
That 4K is really working its magic.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.979
Schneider the intern, checking in.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.275
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.654
I just wanna say,
it's a real honor playing as a woman.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.325
A real pleasure.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.203
Stop it!

11:02.286 --> 11:03.454
I'm trying.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.165
How are women not distracted all day?

11:07.083 --> 11:09.085
I cannot believe you two.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.879
Talking to peoples who aren't even there.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.006
[scoffs] Can you believe this, Berto?

11:16.801 --> 11:18.761
Anyway...

11:18.844 --> 11:20.137
We're about to battle,

11:20.221 --> 11:24.225
but first, let's check out
those lifelike reflections on the floor.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.976
[both] Oh...

11:26.060 --> 11:29.563
[both exclaiming]

11:29.647 --> 11:31.732
But I'm a lady!

11:32.650 --> 11:35.319
-What the hell is going on?
-I'm working, Mom!

11:35.403 --> 11:40.074
Penelope, tell my third stepmother
I loved her!

11:41.992 --> 11:45.162
Not the second one, though.
She was kind of a jerk.

11:46.914 --> 11:50.084
Say goodbye to your whole stepfamily,
'cause you're...

11:50.167 --> 11:51.794
[exclaims] ...finished!

11:53.421 --> 11:55.589
Okay, guys, subscribe to my channel.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.884
This is Blanquita16 signing off.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.930
Peace in the real world,
chaos everywhere else.  Adiós!

12:03.889 --> 12:06.225
Sorry, I was wrong.
This is obviously work.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.519
It's like watching
a business class at Harvard.

12:08.602 --> 12:12.565
It's going great.
I'm up to over 100 subscribers.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.400
Yeah, Elena is legit.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.862
She's gonna be a mogul, have an entourage,
probably a jet.

12:17.945 --> 12:21.532
Mogul, entourage, jet?
Those are my things!

12:21.615 --> 12:24.160
Elena, give  papito  back his things.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.622
She's been working really hard at this.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.167
I'm so inspired. Makes me wanna get a job.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.711
-You have a job.
-No, this is just an internship.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.338
-Fix the lights.
-I'll call Butch.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.381
Whatever!

12:38.257 --> 12:40.885
Look, Elena, I'm glad this is going well.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.721
-But how much money have you made?
-Seven thousand...

12:44.472 --> 12:47.308
magic pebbles,
redeemable for virtual stickers.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.686
Elena, a real job is much more--

12:50.769 --> 12:52.188
Boring.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.024
Papito,  no.
You just came on the wrong day.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.693
It's usually much more exciting.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.320
The other day, this guy came in

12:59.403 --> 13:01.947
with a rash that looked like
a smiley face. [laughs] Come on.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.992
I'm gonna return the shoes.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.244
No. You have a job.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.621
And I hate that job.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.831
I wanna do what Elena's doing
or anything else.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.541
You can't quit after one day.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.336
You gotta see this rash.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.172
His nipples are the eyes.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.715
Ew!

13:22.885 --> 13:25.429
I'm going to teach you
a very important part of medicine.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.265
How to take a patient history.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.102
So, why don't you pretend to be...

13:32.186 --> 13:35.314
Oh, I don't know... your grandmother?

13:37.483 --> 13:38.484
That's weird.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.529
But I'm super bored, so sure.

13:41.612 --> 13:46.116
Great, great, great.
Okay. First question. Uh... Age?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.285
[imitates Lydia] A lady never tells.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.626
Of course. Of course. Any allergies?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.254
My Cuban blood is far too strong.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.465
Man, you are good.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.259
Okay. Okay.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.263
-Favorite flower?
-[in normal voice] That a medical thing?

14:07.346 --> 14:10.391
It's related to the allergies.
Just answer the question.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.853
-I guess gardenias.
-Perfect.

14:14.228 --> 14:18.148
So, Thai food at home
or duck à l'orange at a candlelit bistro?

14:19.984 --> 14:22.778
Look, Doc, my grandma likes you.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.447
You just need to be a little more chill.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.868
Not so available. Be busy sometimes.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.582
And that is why you always wear gloves.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.009
-Nurse Alvarez, do you have a second?
-Yeah. Of course I do. Come in.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.680
What can I do for you?

14:50.306 --> 14:53.767
I wanted to come back and tell you
that you totally screwed me over.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.354
[chuckles] Excuse me?

14:57.438 --> 15:00.441
My insurance company is charging me
for my physical,

15:00.524 --> 15:03.986
because it happened
in the same 365-day period as my last one,

15:04.069 --> 15:05.446
and I'm covered for one a year!

15:05.529 --> 15:07.323
I'm sorry that's happening,

15:07.406 --> 15:09.742
but you did call and ask to be seen
as soon as possible.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.536
No, I would have waited
if I knew it was gonna cost me money.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.954
[inhales, exhales]

15:14.038 --> 15:16.498
Know what? I'm gonna go
to Dr. Mazzara from now on.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.541
Send my stuff there.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.253
I'm sorry to hear that. I'll do that.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.838
Try not to screw that up, too.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.109
So, um, how was your day? Wanna talk?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.904
Nah. I'm good.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.077
What was the most interesting thing
that happened?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.831
Okay, I'll go first.

15:59.083 --> 16:03.253
I discovered that the coffee machine
also makes hot cocoa.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.171
What?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.548
Total game changer.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.889
[sighs] So, how about that guy
that went off on you?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.265
[scoffs]

16:15.808 --> 16:16.976
Does that happen a lot?

16:19.395 --> 16:20.270
Sometimes.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.899
[sighs] It's part of the gig.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.443
Gotta put up with crap you don't want to.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.405
Some days you're taking blood pressure,

16:29.488 --> 16:33.200
and you just wanna keep squeezing,
and squeezing and squeezing

16:33.283 --> 16:35.953
until their stupid eyes pop out
of their stupid head.

16:37.955 --> 16:38.998
Dang,  Mami!

16:40.124 --> 16:41.917
It's fine. Put those headphones back on.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.628
[screams]

16:46.672 --> 16:48.757
-I didn't push play yet.
-[exhales]

16:48.841 --> 16:50.676
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll wait till you push play.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.932
[screams and pants]

16:57.808 --> 17:00.936
Okay, guys. I'm finally on pace
to beat this speed run.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.189
Only 57 failed attempts.
No big. [chuckles]

17:05.274 --> 17:08.694
Elena, what are the first few words
of the Declaration of Independence?

17:08.777 --> 17:09.903
Leave me alone.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.530
I know that's the gist of it.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.658
Abuelita,  I'm working.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.036
Okay, fine. I don't need you anyways,

17:17.828 --> 17:22.416
because I have Cuban tricks
to remember American facts.

17:22.499 --> 17:27.379
Por ejemplo,  the American flag
is red, white and blue.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.507
The Cuban flag is red, white, and blue.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.677
The American flag has 50 stars.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.262
And Cuba has one.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.014
Me.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.145
I'm recording!

17:43.228 --> 17:44.980
What is going on now?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.066
I'm working and you're in my office!

17:47.566 --> 17:50.861
Elena, I had a long day at work.

17:50.944 --> 17:54.364
Can I have five minutes of peace and quiet
after I walk through the door?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.036
The usual?

18:09.213 --> 18:11.882
No, no. Leave the bottle.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.720
[squeals]

18:16.804 --> 18:20.849
Elena, when is the last time you slept...
[sniffs] ...or took a shower?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.268
Those aren't options
when you're building a brand.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.561
I can help.

18:25.437 --> 18:29.149
No, no, no. Get out of here!
I'm falling behind.

18:29.233 --> 18:33.487
My subscribers expect constant content.
There's this couple in Bulgaria

18:33.570 --> 18:36.365
who are just waking up
that I can't disappoint.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.951
Dobro utro,  Mr. and Mrs. Berbatov.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.412
Wait. Dude, you're in the final castle.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.582
I know. I'm almost there. Just one more--

18:48.127 --> 18:50.295
What? What is...

18:52.256 --> 18:53.924
Hey, guys.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.552
Butch was busy,

18:56.635 --> 18:58.929
so I was doing a little sleuthing
on the electrical panel.

18:59.012 --> 19:02.099
Question. Did the power go off
for a couple seconds?

19:03.058 --> 19:06.937
I have to start over. I'm gonna kill you!

19:07.020 --> 19:10.399
-Whoa! You seem stressed, boss. Coffee?
-Get over here!

19:10.482 --> 19:12.651
[screaming]

19:13.986 --> 19:15.237
[Penelope] Stop it!

19:15.320 --> 19:18.407
Yeah! And, girl, you smell rank.

19:21.535 --> 19:22.744
And like violets?

19:23.745 --> 19:25.330
-Get out!
-Okay, all right.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.667
Breathe. Come on, baby.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.171
What's wrong with you?
I need you to breathe.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.047
I'm going crazy.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.675
Last time I went to the bathroom,
18 hours ago,

19:37.217 --> 19:39.887
I looked in the mirror,
and all I saw was a wildling.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.806
I tried to swipe her away, but I couldn't.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.809
And she was trying to swipe me.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.230
Yeah. You're not doing this anymore.
It's over.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.190
What?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.691
Actually, thank you so much.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.487
I thought playing video games
for a living would be amazing.

19:57.571 --> 20:01.491
Then it got hard and tedious
and not fun. It's just more like--

20:01.575 --> 20:03.744
-A job?
-Yeah.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.205
Yes. It's okay.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.249
You're 16.
You don't need to build a brand.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.337
You need to make a little money,
so you could feel good about yourself.

20:15.005 --> 20:18.592
I know I told you my first job
was hard, but, um, was it?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.596
I spent the whole summer
eating free ice cream

20:22.971 --> 20:24.973
and flirting with Joe Camarda.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.976
Sounds pretty good.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.728
Especially if Joe were Jodi.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.064
There you go.

20:32.856 --> 20:36.026
The point is, you have
the rest of your life to hate your job.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.069
And you will.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.200
'Cause when you're an adult,
work is terrible.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.412
When you're not taking someone's pee,
you're taking their crap.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.959
[knocking at door]

20:55.921 --> 20:58.507
Ay,  Leslie. For me?

20:58.590 --> 21:01.468
Hi, Lydia. I forgot you lived here.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.893
Penelope, you remember Liese Aucoin?

21:10.519 --> 21:12.813
She was the patient
with all of the back pain.

21:12.896 --> 21:13.814
Yeah.

21:13.897 --> 21:17.109
I thought it was some sort
of strained muscle, but your mother,

21:17.192 --> 21:19.194
she could tell something was off.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.907
So we sent Liese in for more tests.
And we discovered it was lymphoma.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.869
But we caught it early,
she made a full recovery.

21:28.453 --> 21:32.291
And just last week, she had a baby girl.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.753
She said that she never
would've had a daughter without you.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.340
And so she named her Penelope.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.384
Oh...

21:43.218 --> 21:47.514
So, what I'm hearing is
this is not my gift basket?

21:54.187 --> 21:55.605
Mom, that's awesome.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.650
Yes. You see? Work isn't always terrible.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.569
This showed up after you left,

22:00.652 --> 22:04.239
and I knew you had a pretty rough day,
so I thought I would run it over.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.574
-Thanks, Doc.
-Yeah.

22:05.657 --> 22:09.119
Hey. Hey. I got something for you,
young man.

22:09.202 --> 22:12.372
Here you go. Thank you.
Good work this week.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.373
Thank you.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.418
Leslie, can I make you a plate for dinner?

22:19.212 --> 22:20.672
I wish I could, but I'm busy.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.133
You are? Doing what?

22:24.593 --> 22:25.802
I don't know!

22:29.765 --> 22:33.560
[chuckles] Guys, look at Baby Penelope.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.022
See? When I asked you
to come work with me, Alex,

22:37.105 --> 22:38.774
these are the things I wanted to share.

22:39.775 --> 22:43.195
-You know, this is what's important--
-Oh, my God! $80!

22:44.738 --> 22:45.864
Yeah!

22:45.947 --> 22:49.117
Okay. That's important, too.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.454
Check me out, I'mma make it rain.

22:55.791 --> 23:00.420
It's more like a drizzle, but all right.
Congratulations,  papito.

23:01.254 --> 23:04.508
Man, I worked so hard
and I never even made any money.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.221
Here you go, sweetheart.

23:12.265 --> 23:14.017
Get yourself a little something on me.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.145
-I'm gonna kill you!
-No! No!

23:17.229 --> 23:18.730
[both screaming]

23:18.814 --> 23:20.398
Whatever.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.028
-Hey, hey.
-Hey, Schneider.

23:25.112 --> 23:28.782
I noticed you finally fixed the lights
in the laundry room. Bravo.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.743
Ah, it was the least I could do.
Also, I didn't do it.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.830
See, I realized
why I wasn't happy at work.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.832
Because you never push yourself

23:36.915 --> 23:39.292
and you have the soft, white hands
of a geisha?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.630
Oh...  Arigato.

23:46.007 --> 23:49.970
But it's really that I'm more of a manager
than a "worker," per se.

23:50.053 --> 23:54.015
So I hired an assistant to handle
all the basics around the building

23:54.099 --> 23:56.226
while I focus on the big-picture stuff.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.323
Check it out. I'm Butch.
