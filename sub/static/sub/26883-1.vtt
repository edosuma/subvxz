00:53.880 --> 00:57.045
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Barnaby.

00:57.047 --> 01:00.630
Ho, ho, ho. I hope you're having
a blast this Christmas Eve.

01:00.632 --> 01:05.238
This new souped-up sleigh
is sure a lot of fun.

01:05.239 --> 01:09.878
Yeah, Santa, this was the most fun
I've ever had on all Christmases ever.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.214
A day to remember.

01:12.216 --> 01:15.606
Say, Santa, are we done
with delivering all the presents

01:15.608 --> 01:17.077
to all the good children
of the world?

01:17.079 --> 01:20.118
All done, and in record time.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.974
Where are we off to now, Santa?

01:21.976 --> 01:23.316
I hope there's more fun
to be had.

01:23.318 --> 01:26.261
He, he, he. Ho, ho, ho.
You got that right, Barnaby.

01:26.263 --> 01:28.405
There's a ton more fun
to be had.

01:28.407 --> 01:30.229
The day's not over yet.

01:30.231 --> 01:34.325
We're heading back home to celebrate this
Christmas with all our dear friends.

01:34.327 --> 01:37.238
Are you saying
we're gonna have a party, Santa?

01:37.240 --> 01:38.869
That would be so awesome.

01:38.871 --> 01:40.726
He, he. Ho, ho.

01:40.728 --> 01:44.181
It's gonna be
an amazing Christmas bash.

01:44.183 --> 01:49.301
There's gonna be storytellers and
dancing and music and sing-alongs.

01:49.303 --> 01:50.326
Ho, ho, ho.

01:50.328 --> 01:52.789
That sounds like
a total fun time, Santa.

01:52.791 --> 01:55.478
A great time indeed.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.430
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:57.432 --> 02:00.245
Off to the festivities we go.

02:00.247 --> 02:01.784
Ho, ho, ho.

02:04.696 --> 02:06.261
Ho, we made it. Ho, ho.

02:06.263 --> 02:08.725
And the party is in full swing.

02:08.727 --> 02:10.037
Swinging and ringing.

02:10.038 --> 02:11.829
Hey, look over there.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.646
It's my best pal,
Jimmy the Gingerbread Man.

02:14.648 --> 02:17.141
Oh, he's having
a time of his life,

02:17.143 --> 02:18.421
dancin' away.

02:18.423 --> 02:20.373
Merry Christmas, Jimmy,

02:20.375 --> 02:22.581
and a Happy New Year.

05:37.943 --> 05:40.696
Whoa. I never knew
Jimmy was such a great dancer.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.318
Well, check it out, Barnaby.

05:47.320 --> 05:52.341
That's our pal, Alfie the Elf,
dancing the Merry Macarena.

05:52.343 --> 05:54.550
Dancing and ringing
the New Year away.

05:54.552 --> 05:58.040
Merry Christmas, Alfie,
and a Happy New Year.

09:17.016 --> 09:20.980
Well, what do you know, it's the
coolest dancer in the North Pole.

09:20.982 --> 09:23.414
Hey, it's Nutty the Nutcracker.

09:23.416 --> 09:25.780
He's nuts and nuttier,
but what a dancer.

09:25.782 --> 09:30.134
Merry Christmas, Nutty,
and a Happy New Year to ya.

11:46.935 --> 11:48.660
Hey, look over yonder.

11:48.662 --> 11:50.772
It's Slinky the baby Squirrel

11:50.774 --> 11:52.726
dancin' up
a squirrel of a storm.

11:52.728 --> 11:54.037
Ho, ho, ho.

11:54.039 --> 11:56.023
Merry Christmas, Slinky.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.919
Aww, cute Slinky.

15:35.318 --> 15:37.237
Hey, Barnaby, what do you say,

15:37.239 --> 15:40.341
we go and listen
to an amazing Christmas story?

15:40.343 --> 15:42.005
Who'll tell us one?

15:42.007 --> 15:43.509
I have an idea.

15:43.511 --> 15:45.718
Let's go see Horace the Horse.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.445
He's a great storyteller,

15:47.447 --> 15:50.228
and he'll tell us
a marvelous Christmas story.

15:50.230 --> 15:51.318
Let's go.

15:57.206 --> 16:01.301
Hey, Horace, we're here to listen
to a great Christmas story.

16:01.303 --> 16:04.244
Yeah, we hear
you're an amazing storyteller.

16:04.246 --> 16:05.557
Will you tell us one?

16:05.559 --> 16:07.988
My pleasure, Santa and Barnaby.

16:07.990 --> 16:11.477
I have a great story.
Here is how it goes.

16:11.479 --> 16:15.444
Two little children were sitting by
the fire on one cold winter's night.

16:15.446 --> 16:18.612
All at once they heard
a timid knock at the door.

16:18.614 --> 16:20.118
And one ran to open it.

16:24.182 --> 16:26.901
There, outside in
the cold and the darkness,

16:26.903 --> 16:29.141
stood a child with no shoes
upon his feet

16:29.143 --> 16:31.668
and clad in thin,
ragged garments.

16:31.670 --> 16:33.525
He was shivering with cold,

16:33.527 --> 16:35.797
and he asked to come in
and warm himself.

16:35.799 --> 16:37.910
"Yes, come,"
cried both the children.

16:37.912 --> 16:40.629
"You shall have our place
by the fire. Come in."

16:40.631 --> 16:42.549
They drew the little stranger
to their warm seat

16:42.551 --> 16:45.364
and shared their supper with
him, and gave him their bed,

16:45.366 --> 16:47.445
while they slept
on a hard bench.

16:47.447 --> 16:50.709
In the night they were awakened
by strains of sweet music

16:50.711 --> 16:52.917
and, looking out,
they saw a band of children

16:52.919 --> 16:55.605
in shining garments
approaching the house.

16:55.607 --> 16:57.748
They were playing
on golden harps,

16:57.750 --> 16:59.701
and the air was full of melody.

16:59.703 --> 17:01.749
Suddenly the Stranger Child
stood before them,

17:01.751 --> 17:06.612
no longer cold and ragged,
but clad in silvery light.

17:06.614 --> 17:10.483
His soft voice said,
"I was cold, and you took Me in.

17:10.486 --> 17:13.012
"I was hungry, and you fed Me.

17:13.013 --> 17:15.701
"I was tired,
and you gave Me your bed.

17:15.703 --> 17:18.164
"I am the Christ Child,
wandering through the world

17:18.165 --> 17:20.884
"to bring peace and happiness
to all good children.

17:20.886 --> 17:26.420
As you have given to Me, so may this
tree every year give rich fruit to you."

17:26.422 --> 17:30.292
So saying, He broke a branch from the
fir tree that grew near the door,

17:30.294 --> 17:32.917
and He planted it
into the ground and disappeared.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.860
But the branch grew
into a great tree,

17:35.862 --> 17:40.023
and every year it bore wonderful
golden fruit for the kind children.

17:44.599 --> 17:47.477
Thank you for
that amazing story, Horace.

17:47.479 --> 17:50.421
Have a wonderful Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho.

17:50.423 --> 17:52.951
See you next time, Horace.
Goodbye.

17:54.231 --> 17:56.245
Ho, ho, ho. Look over there.

17:56.247 --> 17:58.068
It's Benny the Beaver,

17:58.070 --> 17:59.828
having the time of his life,

17:59.830 --> 18:01.845
kickin' up those webbed feet.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.244
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Benny.

18:04.246 --> 18:05.812

havin' a time.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.603
Look at those duck legs go.

25:23.605 --> 25:24.756
Ho, ho, ho.

25:24.758 --> 25:26.836
Merry Christmas, Danny.

27:44.407 --> 27:47.604
I think I know
where the most incredible dancer

27:47.606 --> 27:49.811
of all time is performing today.

27:49.813 --> 27:54.484
Rudolph the Rabbit is stomping those
big ol' bunny feet to a groovy tune.

27:54.486 --> 27:56.596
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Rudolph.

30:12.694 --> 30:17.523
Say, Barnaby, I'm in the mood
for a good Christmas story.

30:17.525 --> 30:19.317
Oh, yeah, me, too.

30:19.319 --> 30:21.172
Who will tell us
a great story, Santa?

30:21.174 --> 30:25.940
I know just the ruminant who can
tell the most amazing stories.

30:25.942 --> 30:27.349
Who would that be?

30:27.351 --> 30:30.612
Let's go see
Silky the Christmas Cow.

30:30.614 --> 30:31.892
Silky the Christmas Cow?

30:31.894 --> 30:34.739
I love her. She's the best
storyteller in the world.

30:34.741 --> 30:36.788
Ho, ho, ho. Indeed.

30:36.790 --> 30:37.719
Ho, ho, ho.

30:44.023 --> 30:46.323
Hey there, Silky.

30:46.325 --> 30:49.269
Santa, do I have
a story for you.

30:49.271 --> 30:51.155
Glad to hear that, Silky.

30:51.157 --> 30:53.172
What story will it be?

30:53.174 --> 30:54.547
What about one of my favorites?

30:54.549 --> 30:58.035
It's called the "Three Kings"
and it goes like this...

30:58.037 --> 31:00.403
Three kings came riding
from far away.

31:00.405 --> 31:02.453
Melchior and Gaspar
and Balthazar.

31:04.149 --> 31:06.259
Three Wise Men
out of the East were they,

31:06.261 --> 31:09.012
and they traveled by night
and they slept by day,

31:09.014 --> 31:12.213
for their guide was a beautiful,
wonderful star.

31:12.215 --> 31:15.156
The star was so beautiful,
large, and clear,

31:15.158 --> 31:19.859
that all the other stars of the sky
became a white mist in the atmosphere,

31:19.861 --> 31:22.421
and by this they knew
that the coming was near

31:22.423 --> 31:25.396
of the Prince foretold
in the prophecy.

31:25.398 --> 31:28.180
Three caskets they bore
on their saddle-bows,

31:28.182 --> 31:30.612
three caskets of gold
with golden keys,

31:30.614 --> 31:32.531
their robes were of
crimson silk,

31:32.533 --> 31:35.539
with rows of bells
and pomegranates and furbelows,

31:35.541 --> 31:38.964
their turbans like
blossoming almond trees.

31:38.966 --> 31:41.779
And so the Three Kings
rode into the West,

31:41.781 --> 31:44.723
through the dusk of night,
over hill and dell,

31:44.725 --> 31:47.443
and sometimes they nodded
with beard on breast

31:47.445 --> 31:49.909
and sometimes talked,
as they paused to rest,

31:49.911 --> 31:53.140
with the people they met
at some wayside well.

31:53.142 --> 31:55.539
"Of the child that is born,"
said Balthazar,

31:55.541 --> 31:57.492
"Good people, I pray you,
tell us the news,

31:57.494 --> 32:02.740
"for we in the East have seen his star, and
have ridden fast, and have ridden far,

32:02.742 --> 32:05.588
"to find and worship
the King of the Jews."

32:05.590 --> 32:07.987
And the people answered,
"You ask in vain,

32:07.989 --> 32:10.421
we know of no king
but Herod the Great."

32:10.423 --> 32:12.692
They thought the Wise Men
were men insane,

32:12.694 --> 32:15.188
as they spurred their horses
across the plain,

32:15.190 --> 32:18.004
like riders in haste
who cannot wait.

32:18.006 --> 32:21.875
And when they came to Jerusalem, Herod
the Great, who had heard this thing

32:21.877 --> 32:23.923
sent for the Wise Men
and questioned them,

32:23.925 --> 32:26.291
and said,
"Go down unto Bethlehem,

32:26.293 --> 32:28.947
and bring me tidings
of this new king."

32:28.949 --> 32:31.667
So they rode away,
and the star stood still,

32:31.669 --> 32:33.748
the only one
in the gray of morn,

32:33.750 --> 32:37.331
yet, it stopped, it stood still
of its own free will,

32:37.333 --> 32:42.420
right over Bethlehem on the hill, the
city of David, where Christ was born.

32:42.422 --> 32:45.044
And the Three Kings rode through
the gate and the guard,

32:45.046 --> 32:47.795
through the silent street, till
their horses turned and neighed

32:47.797 --> 32:49.907
as they entered
the great inn-yard,

32:49.909 --> 32:52.019
but the windows were closed
and the doors were barred,

32:52.021 --> 32:54.675
and only a light
in the stable burned.

32:54.677 --> 32:56.852
And cradled there
in the scented hay,

32:56.854 --> 32:59.475
in the air made sweet
by the breath of kine,

32:59.477 --> 33:01.269
the little child
in the manger lay,

33:01.271 --> 33:06.388
the child, that would be king one day
of a kingdom not human but divine.

33:06.390 --> 33:10.292
His mother Mary of Nazareth sat
watching beside his place of rest,

33:10.294 --> 33:12.499
watching the even flow
of his breath,

33:12.501 --> 33:14.323
for the joy of life
and the terror of death

33:14.325 --> 33:17.556
were mingled together
in her breast.

33:17.558 --> 33:19.603
They laid their offerings
at his feet,

33:19.605 --> 33:21.587
the gold was their tribute
to a King,

33:21.589 --> 33:23.411
the frankincense,
with its odor sweet,

33:23.413 --> 33:25.652
was for the Priest,
the Paraclete,

33:25.654 --> 33:27.699
the myrrh
for the body's burying.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.779
And the mother wondered
and bowed her head,

33:29.781 --> 33:32.276
and sat as still
as a statue of stone,

33:32.278 --> 33:34.131
her heart was troubled
yet comforted,

33:34.133 --> 33:38.836
remembering what the Angel had said of
an endless reign and of David's throne.

33:38.838 --> 33:40.883
Then the Kings rode out
of the city gate,

33:40.885 --> 33:43.091
with a clatter of hoofs
in proud array,

33:43.093 --> 33:45.139
but they went not back
to Herod the Great,

33:45.141 --> 33:47.539
for they knew his malice
and feared his hate,

33:47.541 --> 33:49.749
and returned to their homes
by another way.

33:53.302 --> 33:58.484
Thank you, Silky. That was a great
Christmas story, if I've ever heard one.

33:58.486 --> 34:00.211
It was indeed.

34:00.213 --> 34:02.870
Ho, ho, ho. Off we go.

34:08.021 --> 34:10.068
Hey, it's Parrot Pete.

34:10.070 --> 34:14.452
He knows the way
to More-To-Be-Had.

34:14.454 --> 34:18.967
Let's follow him. Fly high, fly
low, Parrot Pete, we're right with you.

34:24.502 --> 34:26.900
Hey-hey,
look over there, Barnaby.

34:26.902 --> 34:31.955
It's the Christmas Sheep just jumping
their little hooves off. Ho, ho, ho.

34:31.956 --> 34:34.452
Don't get too sleepy now,
Christmas Sheep.

34:34.454 --> 34:36.726
There's still more party
to be had. Ha, ha, ha.

Say, Barnaby, you know what
I'm in the mood for?

44:37.558 --> 44:39.571
What, Santa?

44:39.573 --> 44:43.604
A grand ol' Christmas story
to get me in the holiday mood.

44:43.606 --> 44:46.228
Me, too. Who will tell us one?

44:46.230 --> 44:49.394
What about our dear pal
Frosty the Donkey,

44:49.396 --> 44:52.595
who lives by the old
Bubbling Mill Creek?

44:52.597 --> 44:54.259
That's a great idea, Santa.

44:54.261 --> 44:56.627
He's the awesomest
storyteller ever.

44:56.629 --> 44:58.709
Ho, ho, ho, let's go.

45:07.701 --> 45:09.267
Hey-hey, Frosty.

45:09.269 --> 45:13.715
How about you tell us one of your
wonderful Christmas stories?

45:13.717 --> 45:15.636
Yeah, that would be great.

45:15.638 --> 45:19.507
By all means, fellas,
I sure do have a story for you.

45:19.509 --> 45:21.333
Here is how it begins.

45:23.669 --> 45:25.555
Piccola lived in Italy,

45:25.557 --> 45:30.548
where the oranges grow, and where all the
year the sun shines warm and bright.

45:30.550 --> 45:34.292
I suppose you think Piccola a very
strange name for a little girl,

45:34.294 --> 45:36.946
but in her country
it was not strange at all,

45:36.948 --> 45:40.595
and her mother thought it the
sweetest name a little girl ever had.

45:40.597 --> 45:44.595
Piccola had no kind father,
no big brother or sister,

45:44.597 --> 45:46.963
and no sweet baby
to play with and love.

45:46.965 --> 45:50.356
She and her mother lived
all alone in an old stone house

45:50.358 --> 45:52.787
that looked on a dark,
narrow street.

45:52.789 --> 45:56.883
They were very poor, and the mother
was away from home almost every day,

45:56.885 --> 45:58.963
washing clothes
and scrubbing floors,

45:58.965 --> 46:02.771
and working hard to earn money
for her little girl and herself.

46:02.773 --> 46:06.611
So you see, Piccola was alone
a great deal of the time.

46:06.613 --> 46:09.938
And if she had not been a very
happy, contented little child,

46:09.940 --> 46:12.244
I hardly know what
she would have done.

46:12.246 --> 46:15.668
She had no playthings except a
heap of stones in the backyard

46:15.670 --> 46:17.459
that she used
for building houses

46:17.461 --> 46:21.843
and a very old, very ragged doll that her
mother had found in the street one day.

46:21.845 --> 46:25.842
But there was a small round hole in the
stone wall at the back of her yard,

46:25.844 --> 46:30.068
and her greatest pleasure was to look
through that into her neighbor's garden.

46:30.070 --> 46:33.587
When she stood on a stone, and
put her eyes close to the hole,

46:33.589 --> 46:36.275
she could see the green grass
in the garden,

46:36.277 --> 46:38.451
and smell the sweet flowers,

46:38.453 --> 46:41.362
and even hear the water
splashing into the fountain.

46:41.364 --> 46:43.987
She had never seen
anyone walking in the garden,

46:43.989 --> 46:45.971
for it belonged
to an old gentleman

46:45.973 --> 46:48.307
who did not care
about grass and flowers.

46:48.309 --> 46:52.755
One day in the autumn her mother told her
that the old gentleman had gone away,

46:52.757 --> 46:55.955
and had rented his house to a
family of little American children,

46:55.957 --> 46:59.987
who had come with their sick mother
to spend the winter in Italy.

46:59.989 --> 47:02.643
After this, Piccola
was never lonely,

47:02.645 --> 47:06.548
for all day long the children ran and
played and danced and sang in the garden.

47:06.550 --> 47:10.003
It was several weeks
before they saw her at all,

47:10.005 --> 47:12.051
and I am not sure they ever
would have done so,

47:12.053 --> 47:14.644
but one day their kitten
ran away,

47:14.646 --> 47:16.755
and in chasing her
they came close to the wall

47:16.757 --> 47:20.179
and saw Piccola's black eyes looking
through the hole in the stones.

47:20.181 --> 47:22.643
They were a little
frightened at first,

47:22.645 --> 47:23.988
they did not speak to her,

47:23.990 --> 47:26.516
but the next day
she was there again,

47:26.518 --> 47:29.427
and Rose, the oldest girl,
went up to the wall

47:29.429 --> 47:31.283
and talked to her
a little while.

47:31.285 --> 47:35.091
When the children found that she had no
one to play with and was very lonely,

47:35.093 --> 47:38.322
they talked to her every day, and
often brought her fruits and candies,

47:38.324 --> 47:40.660
and passed them through
the hole in the wall.

47:40.662 --> 47:42.706
One day they even
pushed the kitten through.

47:42.708 --> 47:44.723
But the hole was hardly
large enough for her,

47:44.725 --> 47:47.347
and she mewed and scratched
and was very much frightened.

47:47.349 --> 47:49.908
After that the little boy
said he would ask his father

47:49.910 --> 47:52.147
if the hole might not
be made larger,

47:52.149 --> 47:54.708
and then Piccola could
come in and play with them.

47:54.710 --> 47:58.130
The father had found out that
Piccola's mother was a good woman,

47:58.132 --> 48:00.787
and that the little girl herself
was sweet and kind,

48:00.789 --> 48:03.379
so that he was very glad to have
some of the stones broken away

48:03.381 --> 48:05.938
and an opening made
for Piccola to come in.

48:05.940 --> 48:09.491
How excited she was,
and how glad the children were

48:09.493 --> 48:11.380
when she first stepped
into the garden.

48:11.382 --> 48:15.571
She wore her best dress, a long,
bright-colored woolen skirt and a white waist.

48:15.573 --> 48:17.650
Round her neck was
a string of beads,

48:17.652 --> 48:20.051
and on her feet were
little wooden shoes.

48:20.053 --> 48:23.763
It would seem very strange to us,
would it not, to wear wooden shoes,

48:23.765 --> 48:26.771
but Piccola and her mother
had never worn anything else,

48:26.773 --> 48:28.978
and never had
any money to buy socks.

48:28.980 --> 48:31.859
Piccola almost always
ran about barefooted,

48:31.861 --> 48:34.482
like the kittens and the
chickens and the little ducks.

48:34.484 --> 48:36.435
What a good time
they had that day,

48:36.437 --> 48:38.195
and how glad
Piccola's mother was

48:38.197 --> 48:42.034
that her little girl could have such
a pleasant, safe place to play in

48:42.036 --> 48:43.794
while she was away at work.

48:43.796 --> 48:48.979
By and by December came, and the little
Americans began to talk about Christmas.

48:48.981 --> 48:51.603
One day, when Piccola's
curly head and bright eyes

48:51.605 --> 48:53.234
came peeping through
the hole in the wall,

48:53.236 --> 48:55.122
they ran to her
and helped her in,

48:55.124 --> 48:57.490
and as they did so,
they all asked her at once

48:57.492 --> 49:00.466
what she thought she would have
for a Christmas present.

49:00.468 --> 49:02.579
"A Christmas present,"
said Piccola.

49:02.581 --> 49:04.274
"Why, what is that?"

49:04.276 --> 49:06.995
The children looked
surprised at this,

49:06.997 --> 49:12.242
and Rose said, rather gravely, "Dear
Piccola, don't you know what Christmas is?"

49:12.244 --> 49:16.659
Oh, yes, Piccola knew it was the happy
day when the baby Christ was born,

49:16.661 --> 49:19.666
and she had been to church on that
day and heard the beautiful singing,

49:19.668 --> 49:22.419
and had seen the picture
of the Babe lying in the manger,

49:22.421 --> 49:24.658
with cattle and sheep
sleeping round about.

49:24.660 --> 49:26.868
Oh, yes, she knew
all that very well,

49:26.870 --> 49:28.788
but what was
a Christmas present?

49:28.790 --> 49:32.403
Then the children began to laugh
and to answer her all together.

49:32.405 --> 49:33.810
There was such
a clatter of tongues

49:33.812 --> 49:36.755
that she could hear only a few
of the words now and then,

49:36.757 --> 49:38.995
such as "chimney,"
"Santa Claus,"

49:38.997 --> 49:41.011
"stockings," "reindeer,"

49:41.013 --> 49:44.562
"Christmas Eve,"
"candies and toys."

49:44.564 --> 49:46.547
Piccola put her hands
over her ears and said,

49:46.549 --> 49:50.611
"Oh, I can't understand
one word. You tell me, Rose."

49:50.613 --> 49:53.427
Then Rose told her
all about jolly St. Claus,

49:53.429 --> 49:56.146
with his red cheeks
and white beard and fur coat,

49:56.148 --> 49:58.803
and about his reindeer
and sleigh full of toys.

49:58.805 --> 50:00.596
"Every Christmas Eve,"
said Rose,

50:00.598 --> 50:04.882
"he comes down the chimney, and fills
the stockings of all the good children,

50:04.884 --> 50:06.835
"so, Piccola, you hang up
your stocking,

50:06.837 --> 50:11.347
and who knows what a beautiful Christmas
present you will find when morning comes."

50:11.349 --> 50:13.843
Of course Piccola thought
this was a delightful plan,

50:13.845 --> 50:15.635
and was very pleased
to hear about it.

50:15.637 --> 50:19.122
Then all the children told her of every
Christmas Eve they could remember,

50:19.124 --> 50:21.490
and of the presents
they had had,

50:21.492 --> 50:24.339
so that she went home thinking
of nothing but dolls and hoops

50:24.341 --> 50:27.762
and balls and ribbons and
marbles and wagons and kites.

50:27.764 --> 50:29.875
She told her mother
about Santa Claus,

50:29.877 --> 50:32.050
and her mother seemed to think
that perhaps he did not know

50:32.052 --> 50:34.324
there was any little girl
in that house,

50:34.326 --> 50:36.466
and very likely
he would not come at all.

50:36.468 --> 50:39.827
But Piccola felt very sure
Santa Claus would remember her,

50:39.829 --> 50:44.530
for her little friends had promised to send
a letter up the chimney to remind him.

50:44.532 --> 50:46.866
Christmas Eve came at last.

50:46.868 --> 50:49.267
Piccola's mother hurried home
from her work.

50:49.269 --> 50:53.906
They had their little supper of soup
and bread, and soon it was bedtime,

50:53.908 --> 50:55.730
time to get ready
for Santa Claus.

50:55.732 --> 51:00.275
But, oh! Piccola remembered that for the
first time that the children had told her

51:00.277 --> 51:04.595
she must hang up her stocking, and she
hadn't any, and neither had her mother.

51:04.597 --> 51:07.378
How sad, how sad it was.

51:07.380 --> 51:10.804
Now Santa Claus would come,
and perhaps be angry

51:10.806 --> 51:13.778
because he couldn't find
anyplace to put the present.

51:13.780 --> 51:16.211
The poor little girl
stood by the fireplace,

51:16.213 --> 51:19.090
and the big tears began
to run down her cheeks.

51:19.092 --> 51:23.026
Just then her mother called to her,
"Hurry, Piccola, come to bed."

51:23.028 --> 51:27.571
What should she do? But she stopped
crying, and tried to think,

51:27.573 --> 51:29.522
and in a moment she
remembered her wooden shoes,

51:29.524 --> 51:31.219
and ran off to get one of them.

51:31.221 --> 51:33.843
She put it close to the chimney,
and said to herself,

51:33.845 --> 51:36.402
"Surely Santa Claus will know
what it's there for.

51:36.404 --> 51:38.354
"He will know I haven't
any stockings,

51:38.356 --> 51:40.626
so I gave him the shoe instead."

51:40.628 --> 51:42.419
Then she went off
happily to her bed,

51:42.421 --> 51:46.483
and was asleep almost as soon as she had
nestled close to her mother's side.

51:46.485 --> 51:51.123
The sun had only just begun to shine
next morning when Piccola woke.

51:51.125 --> 51:54.579
With one jump she was out on the floor
and running toward the chimney.

51:54.581 --> 51:57.139
The wooden shoe was lying
where she had left it,

51:57.141 --> 52:00.179
but you could never,
never guess what was in it.

52:00.181 --> 52:02.354
Piccola had not meant
to wake her mother,

52:02.356 --> 52:06.770
but this surprise was more than any
little girl could bear and yet be quiet,

52:06.772 --> 52:11.602
so she danced to the bed with the shoe in her
hand, calling, "Mother, Mother! Look, look!

52:11.604 --> 52:14.163
See the present
Santa Claus brought me!"

52:14.165 --> 52:17.298
Her mother raised her head
and looked into the shoe.

52:17.300 --> 52:21.170
"Why, Piccola," she said, "a little
chimney swallow nestled in your shoe?

52:21.172 --> 52:23.986
What a good Santa Claus
to bring you a bird!"

52:23.988 --> 52:26.803
"Good Santa Claus, dear Santa
Claus!" cried Piccola.

52:26.805 --> 52:29.971
And she kissed her mother and kissed
the bird and kissed the shoe,

52:29.973 --> 52:33.394
and even threw kisses up
the chimney, she was so happy.

52:33.396 --> 52:35.027
When the birdling was
taken out of the shoe,

52:35.029 --> 52:38.483
they found that he did not try to
fly, only to hop about the room.

52:38.485 --> 52:42.163
And as they looked closer, they could see
that one of his wings was hurt a little.

52:42.165 --> 52:45.395
But the mother bound it up carefully,
so that it did not seem to pain him,

52:45.397 --> 52:48.435
and he was so gentle that he took
a drink of water from a cup,

52:48.437 --> 52:51.826
and even ate crumbs and seeds
out of Piccola's hands.

52:51.828 --> 52:54.611
She was a proud little girl when
she took her Christmas present

52:54.613 --> 52:56.498
to show the children
in the garden.

52:56.500 --> 53:01.298
They had had a great many gifts, dolls that
could say "mama," bright picture books,

53:01.300 --> 53:04.146
trains of cars, toy pianos,

53:04.148 --> 53:07.635
but not one of their playthings was
alive, like Piccola's birdling.

53:07.637 --> 53:10.867
They were as pleased as she,
and Rose hunted about the house

53:10.869 --> 53:12.850
until she found
a large wicker cage

53:12.852 --> 53:15.219
that belonged to a blackbird
she once had.

53:15.221 --> 53:16.914
She gave the cage to Piccola,

53:16.916 --> 53:20.050
and the swallow seemed to make
himself quite at home in it at once,

53:20.052 --> 53:23.283
and sat on the perch winking his
bright eyes at the children.

53:23.285 --> 53:25.747
Rose had saved a bag
of candies for Piccola.

53:25.749 --> 53:27.154
And then she went home at last,

53:27.156 --> 53:30.322
with the cage and her dear
swallow safely inside it.

53:30.324 --> 53:34.452
I'm sure there was not a happier little
girl in the whole country of Italy.

53:36.821 --> 53:40.626
Ho, ho, ho.
That was a great story, Frosty.

53:40.628 --> 53:43.089
Yeah, a lovely story.

53:43.091 --> 53:47.058
See you next time, Frosty. Have
a Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho.

53:47.060 --> 53:50.899
Hey, look over there.
Willy's having an icy ball.

53:50.901 --> 53:54.643
Merry Christmas, Willy,
and a Happy New Year.

55:43.509 --> 55:45.074
Hey, look over there.

55:45.076 --> 55:48.753
Gary the Frog is kicking up those
long legs at a holiday jig.

55:48.755 --> 55:52.562
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas,
Gary, and a Happy New Year.

58:27.667 --> 58:31.698
Barnaby, do my squinty eyes
betray me

58:31.700 --> 58:35.475
or is that a whole troupe
of dancing gingerbread men?

58:35.477 --> 58:37.491
It's the Ginger Snapper group.

58:37.493 --> 58:40.786
They are the best gingerbread
dancing fellas in the whole world.

58:40.788 --> 58:43.059
Let's check them out.

58:43.061 --> 58:45.170
You betcha.
They're enormous fun.

58:45.172 --> 58:48.017
Merry Christmas,
Ginger Snappers, ho,

58:48.019 --> 58:51.731
and a Happy New Year to you.
Ho, ho, ho.

01:01:30.067 --> 01:01:33.137
What do I see yonder
in the snowy woods?

01:01:33.139 --> 01:01:35.026
That's Theodore the Teddy Bear.

01:01:35.028 --> 01:01:37.716
He's having a holiday blast.
Look at him go.

01:01:40.883 --> 01:01:45.364
Merry Christmas, Theodore, and
a Happy New Year. Ho, ho, ho.

Say, Barnaby,

01:03:47.028 --> 01:03:50.193
all this partying just makes
me wanna let my beard down

01:03:50.195 --> 01:03:53.201
and kick up a dance-storm
with these snow boots.

01:03:53.203 --> 01:03:54.993
What are you waiting for, Santa,

01:03:54.995 --> 01:03:56.913
this is after all your holiday.

01:03:56.915 --> 01:03:58.258
You should be partying
with the best.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.075
North Pole, here I come. Ho ho.

01:04:01.077 --> 01:04:05.714
I'll show you what Christmas
dancing is all about. Let's go.

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.825
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:05:47.827 --> 01:05:52.787
This has been the best Christmas ever.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:55.026
A bash to remember.

01:05:55.028 --> 01:05:57.330
Merry Christmas, ho, ho.

01:05:57.332 --> 01:06:01.170
And a Happy New Year.
Ho, ho, ho.
