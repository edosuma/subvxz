WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.173
Oh, honey,
don't slouch.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.842
- Oh.
- Okay.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.745
So the gal's gala
is coming up.

00:12.747 --> 00:14.313
That means girls
will be asking boys

00:14.315 --> 00:16.281
To the dance
all week.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.484
They're gonna be
looking at you like
a steer at auction.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.953
Oh, honey,
hold on a second.

00:20.955 --> 00:23.188
You've got
an eyebrow hair
out of place.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.959
Mother, I do not need
your help to be awkward.

00:26.961 --> 00:28.460
Oh, come on.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.396
I bet the girls
are just lining up

00:30.398 --> 00:33.198
To ask my dashing
little love bug.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.770
I mean,
( clears throat )

00:37.772 --> 00:42.341
Creepy old lady who I
have never seen before.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.943
Sorry.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.779
Old people like
to touch my face.

00:46.781 --> 00:49.848
I have, like,
super soft baby skin.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.250
( laughs )

00:51.252 --> 00:52.518
Don't worry.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.652
I've got
a mom, too,

00:53.654 --> 00:55.487
Love bug.
( giggles )

00:55.489 --> 00:58.791
( giggles )

00:58.793 --> 01:00.626
A cheerleader just
talked to me, mom.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.228
Fix my other eyebrow.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.265
Okay, put this on
and don't ask questions.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.872
Okay, press
the button.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.611
( sighs )
oh.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.879
Another
satisfied customer.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.347
( laughs )
match-tastic!

01:23.483 --> 01:25.317
As ridgewood high's
premier matchmaker,

01:25.319 --> 01:27.519
I am known as
the queen of hearts.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.922
The motto is
"let liv let love live."

01:31.891 --> 01:32.958
- Hey, liv?
- Yeah?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.293
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.794
I need advice from
the queen of hearts.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.362
Ah, let me guess--

01:37.364 --> 01:38.764
You want
to ask joey
to the dance?

01:38.766 --> 01:39.832
How'd you know?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.272
Just a hunch.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.408
So will you
help me?

01:49.410 --> 01:51.443
( sighs )
willow,

01:51.445 --> 01:52.845
Your taste in
men baffles me,

01:52.847 --> 01:54.913
But your taste
in matchmakers
is impeccable.

01:56.483 --> 01:57.916
So, the queen
is going to get

01:57.918 --> 01:59.284
Joey and willow
together.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.853
Jillow is about
to be... ♪ real-o.

02:00.855 --> 02:02.988
( both giggle )

02:02.990 --> 02:04.957
All hail
the queen of hearts.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.993
I said
all hail the queen!

02:10.363 --> 02:12.397

03:12.425 --> 03:13.825
Dude, what
are you doing?

03:13.827 --> 03:15.928
I accidentally
stepped on my
cupcake.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.630
Don't want to waste
the frosting.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.933
That's so nasty.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.634
Want to taste?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.536
You know I do.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.538
Fall in,
dragons.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.875
I went to this dojo
when I was parker's age.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.744
Yeah, I actually made it
to the highest rank possible--

03:32.746 --> 03:34.713
"iron dragon."

03:34.715 --> 03:37.916
So, when his sensei
made a pilgrimage

03:37.918 --> 03:40.953
Out to her ancestral homeland
of irvine, california,

03:40.955 --> 03:42.788
I volunteered to fill in.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.556
The dragon is back.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.693
Rawr!

03:47.695 --> 03:48.894
But, like, picture that

03:48.896 --> 03:50.596
With, like, fire breath.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.930
Rawr!

03:52.865 --> 03:55.634
I am sensei maddie.

03:56.869 --> 03:59.404
Due to injury, I will
need assistance

03:59.406 --> 04:01.940
So top dragon
please step forward.

04:01.942 --> 04:05.744
Uh, we don't have
a top dragon.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.613
But do you mean
the snack captain?

04:07.615 --> 04:11.717
I guess dragon strike
martial arts

04:11.719 --> 04:12.818
Has gone soft.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.519
Without a top dragon,

04:14.521 --> 04:16.054
What goal
do you strive for?

04:16.056 --> 04:18.824
How will you learn
the way of the dragon?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.994
Burn strong,
strike fast,
no defeat.

04:21.996 --> 04:25.130
Oh, yeah.
That got changed

04:25.132 --> 04:28.500
To "smile bright,
hug hard, no owwies."

04:28.502 --> 04:30.602
- ( boys laugh )
- ( laughs mockingly )

04:30.604 --> 04:32.571
Unacceptable!

04:34.907 --> 04:37.042
Next class you will
all fight each other

04:37.044 --> 04:38.844
Until we find
the top dragon.

04:38.846 --> 04:43.815
Your last easy day
was yesterday.

04:43.817 --> 04:47.953
Rawr!

04:49.088 --> 04:50.889
But, like,
picture that

04:50.891 --> 04:52.958
But with, like,
fire breath.

04:57.730 --> 04:58.897
Joey rooney.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.732
Behold my glorious face
and see the man

05:00.734 --> 05:01.767
Who will be
attending the dance

05:01.769 --> 05:04.069
With your sister
on his arm.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.838
Future brother-in-law.
Burn!

05:08.841 --> 05:11.610
Has liv actually
asked you

05:11.612 --> 05:14.046
- To the gal's gala?
- A mere formality.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.481
I'm surprised
it hasn't happened already.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.683
Why, what have
you heard?

05:18.785 --> 05:20.185
Well, actually
this morning

05:20.187 --> 05:21.520
Liv was saying...

05:22.855 --> 05:24.256
Nothing about you!

05:24.258 --> 05:25.857
( laughs )

05:25.859 --> 05:27.993
Reeled you in
and burned you.  Burn!

05:28.928 --> 05:29.995
Yeah!

05:32.965 --> 05:33.865
You sure this
is gonna work?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.634
Yes, trust
your queen.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.770
Now fly,
my chicken.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.939
Here comes willow
to ask me to the dance.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.041
Ba-bawk!
Ba-bawk!

05:43.043 --> 05:45.510
Ba-bawk!  Ba-bawk!

05:45.512 --> 05:47.879
Will you go
to the gal's gala
with me?

05:47.881 --> 05:49.147
Look, willow...

05:50.083 --> 05:52.718
( rooster clucks, crows )

05:53.953 --> 05:55.554
She's asking me?!

05:55.556 --> 05:56.888
You're asking artie?

05:56.890 --> 05:59.024
She's asking artie!
( laughs )

05:59.026 --> 06:00.625
All part
of the queen's plan.

06:00.627 --> 06:03.161
Joey would never have
said yes to willow

06:03.163 --> 06:04.996
If she'd asked him
and I also knew that

06:04.998 --> 06:06.031
If she asked artie,

06:06.033 --> 06:07.766
Joey would get
crazy jealous

06:07.768 --> 06:09.534
And try
to steal her back.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.836
Really, talking
willow into wearing

06:10.838 --> 06:12.637
The chicken suit
was just for me,

06:12.639 --> 06:15.240
But, hey, queen has
to have a little fun.
( clicks tongue )

06:17.043 --> 06:18.243
Seriously?

06:18.245 --> 06:19.778
Artie?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.580
I thought she was
gonna ask me.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.882
I know.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.818
So super crazy
weird, right?

06:26.820 --> 06:29.287
- Yeah.
- I'm surprised, willow.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.123
I thought you
only had eyes
for joey.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.925
I realized
I was ba-bawking up
the wrong tree.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.928
S-so, wanna go?

06:36.930 --> 06:39.865
Well, let me think.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.566
Hmm.  Shall I...

06:42.969 --> 06:45.070
Go to the dance
with her?

06:45.905 --> 06:50.142
I guess my answer
to willow is going to be--

06:50.144 --> 06:52.911
Anyone want to jump in
under the wire?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.946
In three, two, one...

06:54.948 --> 06:57.115
Zero... Chance.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.850
( deep inhale )

06:58.852 --> 07:00.752
Your loss.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.855
Lady willow of
west stevens point,

07:03.857 --> 07:06.057
I cock-a-doodle
do want to go
with you.

07:08.995 --> 07:11.196
( laughs )

07:11.198 --> 07:12.964
( sighs )

07:12.966 --> 07:14.966
( gasps )

07:14.968 --> 07:16.268
Yeah.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.142
- Fight!
- ( sharp inhale )

07:24.144 --> 07:25.277
( grunts )

07:25.279 --> 07:26.278
- ( grunts )
- ( groans )

07:26.280 --> 07:27.712
Boys: Ooh.

07:27.714 --> 07:28.713
- Ow!
- Ha!

07:28.715 --> 07:29.748
Point,
parker.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.916
Now finish him.

07:30.918 --> 07:31.883
Finish him?
What do you mean?

07:31.885 --> 07:32.884
I already
scored the--

07:32.886 --> 07:35.086
I said
finish him!

07:39.659 --> 07:40.659
( shouts )

07:40.661 --> 07:41.760
Maddie:  <i>Ah.</i>

07:41.762 --> 07:44.062
Victory to parker!

07:44.997 --> 07:46.965
Sit on
the bench of shame.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.767
Go.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.370
Parker, you will
fight reggie

07:52.372 --> 07:53.738
In the finals
tomorrow.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.106
There are no friends...

07:55.108 --> 07:56.174
In this dojo.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.848
Dude, your sister's
one mean dragon.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.182
I know.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.318
I don't mind
punching a kid
in the gut,

08:06.320 --> 08:08.053
But not in
the feelings.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.656
I'll go talk
to her.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.726
Drop some psychology
on her, dr. P.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.063
- Hey, sis.
- Yeah?

08:18.065 --> 08:21.299
I'm a big fan
of humiliation
and yelling,

08:21.301 --> 08:22.834
But it's not
the best way

08:22.836 --> 08:23.835
To motivate
the class.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.403
Oh.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.073
Wow.  Okay.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.207
Never thought about
it that way.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.776
( chuckles )
thanks, little bro.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.880
All right, dragons,
let's round up

08:34.882 --> 08:37.015
For a little
mat chat, yeah?

08:39.085 --> 08:40.785
So...

08:40.787 --> 08:42.787
Parker here has,
um...

08:42.789 --> 08:44.823
Pointed out
to me that

08:44.825 --> 08:46.958
I might be
a little too intense

08:46.960 --> 08:48.460
And might need
to lighten up
a little bit,

08:48.462 --> 08:49.928
You think?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.030
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna happen!

08:53.900 --> 08:56.401
You've all been living
in a "no owwies" world.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.903
Well this world,
is full of owwies.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.438
Yeah, and I am gonna
toughen you up.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.974
So, parker and reggie,
you're gonna face-off tomorrow

09:02.976 --> 09:04.943
Until one of you drops,
and the loser will be

09:04.945 --> 09:06.878
Banned from
this class forever!

09:06.880 --> 09:07.946
Dismissed.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.714
Banned?
You can't--

09:09.716 --> 09:12.150
I said...
Dismissed.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.421
Rawr!

09:17.391 --> 09:20.225
She's not kidding
about that dragon breath.

09:26.999 --> 09:29.167
Huh, what's
going on here?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.403
My little
strawberry shortcake

09:31.405 --> 09:33.271
Artie is polishing
my locker.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.439
Ugh.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.075
Welcome to
the artie party.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.248
Oh.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.016
What's this
behind your ear?

09:49.055 --> 09:51.122
A rose
for my rose.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.525
So, I told
willow that

09:53.527 --> 09:55.460
The more she pretended
to be into artie,

09:55.462 --> 09:57.862
The more it would
drive joey crazy.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.198
I suppose it was
a bit cruel to make

10:00.200 --> 10:01.900
Artie a pawn
in my plan,

10:01.902 --> 10:04.869
But that is what he gets
for dressing as me
for Halloween.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.072
Darling, we have
to choose a moniker

10:07.074 --> 10:08.540
For artie and willow.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.008
Which do you
like better?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.076
Wartie...

10:12.778 --> 10:14.079
Or... Artillow?

10:15.514 --> 10:17.515
I can't choose.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.150
Joey, what
do you think?

10:19.152 --> 10:21.453
Oh, well,
I can't decide between

10:21.455 --> 10:22.988
Don't know,
and don't care.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.356
Joey:  <i>Ha.</i>

10:24.358 --> 10:27.025
Think I'll go with
I don't kn-are.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.160
How can he not kn-are

10:29.162 --> 10:31.363
When I kn-are
so much?

10:31.365 --> 10:33.231
I don't want
to be "wartie."

10:33.233 --> 10:35.300
I want to be
"jillow."

10:39.006 --> 10:41.906
I guess you're
not into liv anymore?

10:41.908 --> 10:44.009
I've had what
my mom refers to as

10:44.011 --> 10:46.011
A moment
of clarity.

10:46.013 --> 10:49.414
I'm only into girls
that are into me.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.551
Care to skip
to class, my peach?

10:53.553 --> 10:56.187
Only if I get to hold
your small, clammy hand.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.256
- Ta-da!
- Ah!

11:04.563 --> 11:06.031
Joey:
"dance... With...

11:06.033 --> 11:07.065
Me?"

11:07.067 --> 11:08.867
That's fun, emily.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.368
Whoever your asking
is a lucky guy.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.570
I'm asking you.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.472
Me?

11:14.474 --> 11:15.974
Why me?
I mean...

11:15.976 --> 11:18.143
( clears throat ) yes.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.249
Wow!  Whoo!

11:24.251 --> 11:27.085
A cute cheerleader
asked me to the dance.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.086
( giggles) oh!

11:28.088 --> 11:30.288
This is the best day ever.

11:30.290 --> 11:34.092
Even better than
the day that I completed
my state quarters collection

11:34.094 --> 11:36.594
By finding
the elusive utah,

11:36.596 --> 11:41.032
Which should give you
some idea of how excited I am.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.971
And the fake leg is done.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.074
Maddie wants us to take
each other out,

11:49.076 --> 11:50.975
Then we'll fake
a gruesome fight.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.977
Parker:
<i>I'm not gonna let</i>
<i>either of us be</i>

11:52.979 --> 11:54.212
Banished from the dojo.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.613
( sighs )

11:55.615 --> 11:58.383
Quit eating
the fake blood!

11:58.385 --> 12:00.385
I can't help it.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.421
You know I have a weakness
for strawberry preserves.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.924
Focus.  This has
to go perfectly.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.293
When maddie sees me
break your fake leg,

12:08.295 --> 12:11.062
We're gonna scare some
sense into that sensei.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.464
Hyah!

12:15.067 --> 12:17.035
Ooh, that hurt my real leg.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.006
- ( doorbell rings )
- ah.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.611
Hello, emily,

12:26.613 --> 12:30.048
The cheerleader that
asked me to the gala.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.516
<i>Come in.</i>

12:31.518 --> 12:32.584
Hey, joey.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.918
I brought this for you.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.186
Oh.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.922
I wanted to say
I'm super excited
about tonight.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.658
Oh, and could you meet me
at the bottom of the stairs

12:40.660 --> 12:42.227
At exactly 8:02?

12:42.229 --> 12:43.561
Yeah, yeah,
whatever you want.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.498
I will be there,

12:46.500 --> 12:47.932
Wearing nothing
but a smile

12:47.934 --> 12:49.234
And this boutonniere...

12:51.004 --> 12:53.071
I will also
be wearing clothes.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.706
Okay.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.474
See you tonight,
love bug.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.676
( joey giggling )

13:01.147 --> 13:05.150
Emily watson is taking you
to the gal's gala?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.285
Nice job, son.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.353
Thanks, dad.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.454
Prank!

13:11.590 --> 13:12.957
What?

13:12.959 --> 13:18.530
No way a girl
that cute wants to go
to the dance with you.

13:18.532 --> 13:20.431
Perhaps you
haven't noticed

13:20.433 --> 13:21.733
Because you see me
everyday,

13:21.735 --> 13:24.469
But I have blossomed.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.738
Earth to blossom,

13:26.740 --> 13:31.109
The flower is so
you can be spotted
in a crowd.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.978
The precise time
is when the prank
is being pulled off.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.182
And standing at the bottom
of the stairs is so they can
dump stuff on your head.

13:38.617 --> 13:43.021
Probably liquid, but possibly
some sort of animal by-product.

13:44.124 --> 13:49.294
Well, I think you've cracked
one too many walnuts
with your forehead.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.595
( laughs )

13:50.597 --> 13:53.064
She's totally into me.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.066
Right, dad?

13:55.068 --> 13:57.135
Well...

13:59.071 --> 14:00.471
I thought
the same thing

14:00.473 --> 14:03.174
As parker at first,

14:03.176 --> 14:06.444
But your mother and I
think you're quite a catch.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.213
Dad's right.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.381
There are
plenty of cheerleaders

14:10.383 --> 14:13.618
- Dying to go out with members
of the rocket club.
- ( joey scoffs )

14:13.620 --> 14:16.621
I am not just
a member.  Ha!

14:16.623 --> 14:19.490
I am vice chancellor of--

14:19.492 --> 14:22.293
Oh, I am
so getting pranked.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.342
See, my darling?

14:37.344 --> 14:41.346
I told you we'd be
the only ones in lavender.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.082
Yep, here we are
at the dance.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.217
Willow and artie,
together.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.620
Just like we both wanted.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.191
These are the texts that I
received from willow today.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.259
( clicks tongue )
so...

14:54.261 --> 14:56.761
"10:47.
Artie's actually into me.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.596
Fix this."
( chuckles )

14:58.598 --> 15:02.867
"12:30.
Joey has a date.
Fix this."

15:02.869 --> 15:07.238
And "3:25.  Pre-dance picnic
behind artie's stepdad's
burger stand.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.840
Fix this."

15:08.842 --> 15:10.575
Ugh.  I really messed up.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.111
- I have to fix this.
- ( cellphone chimes )

15:13.113 --> 15:15.179
Willow agrees.

15:16.348 --> 15:17.682
Wait!

15:17.684 --> 15:19.517
I can't let you two
go into the dance together.

15:20.686 --> 15:21.753
( sighs )
king artie...

15:21.755 --> 15:24.422
The magnificent.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.094
You have my attention.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.497
( insincerely )
liv rooney,

15:32.499 --> 15:36.467
Artie's my date.
What are you doing?

15:36.469 --> 15:38.469
Claiming
my king of hearts.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.139
Artie, will you go to...

15:41.141 --> 15:43.341
The dance with me?

15:46.812 --> 15:47.812
Minions,

15:47.814 --> 15:49.881
Curtain of privacy, please.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.817
Let's go.
Put it up!

15:54.520 --> 15:55.820
( excited scream )

15:55.822 --> 15:57.755
Yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes yes!

15:57.757 --> 16:00.558
-  <i>Yes! ( laughing )</i>
<i>- ( mouths )</i>

16:13.339 --> 16:15.206
Yeah, sure, whatever.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.179
I hope you
can forgive me,

16:21.181 --> 16:22.246
But I can live
with your hate.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.248
( shrieks )

16:35.794 --> 16:37.428
I can't help
but feel that

16:37.430 --> 16:39.497
Some of this
must be my fault.

16:40.799 --> 16:43.835
Mom, you are looking
at a prank-proof box.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.838
This box protects
my head from liquids

16:46.840 --> 16:50.508
And my waistband
from pantsing.
( laughs )

16:50.510 --> 16:53.678
No one's gonna make me
look ridiculous.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.216
Oh, you poor
damaged boy.

17:09.395 --> 17:12.463
Joey?
What are you wearing?

17:12.465 --> 17:15.967
A big box
of dignity,
dollface.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.435
Why?

17:17.437 --> 17:18.903
Please.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.872
You didn't really want
to go to the dance with me.

17:20.874 --> 17:24.542
This was all
an elaborate rouse
to prank me.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.612
Well, the rouse
is on youse.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.750
Who's trying to prank you?

17:32.752 --> 17:36.721
You and the rest of the snooty
yet beautiful people

17:36.723 --> 17:38.523
Who think
you own this school.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.425
Let me tell you
something, emily.

17:40.427 --> 17:43.361
You may be cute,
popular and on
the honor roll,

17:43.363 --> 17:44.896
But I have seen
your cartwheels

17:44.898 --> 17:46.731
And they are
inconsistent at best.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.766
( gasps )

17:48.768 --> 17:50.668
That's right.
I said it.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.969
I am my own man.

17:51.971 --> 17:55.406
Nobody puts joey rooney
in a box...

17:55.408 --> 17:58.810
Except joey rooney,
obviously.

17:58.812 --> 18:02.513
I wasn't trying
to prank you.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.917
I wanted to go
to the dance with
a cute, sweet, funny guy.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.919
Oh.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.387
Huh.

18:12.324 --> 18:14.692
Well, let's not let
two inches of
galvanized steel

18:14.694 --> 18:16.828
And bulletproof glass
ruin our night,

18:16.830 --> 18:18.763
'cause I can
still dance.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.598
Dance, dance,
dance.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.899
Goodbye, joey.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.768
Oh, and by the way,

18:23.770 --> 18:26.704
My cartwheels
are magnificent.

18:28.674 --> 18:29.707
Wait!

18:29.709 --> 18:31.976
No!  Wait!  No!

18:31.978 --> 18:36.347
I have a father and brother
who have no faith in me.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.015
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

18:38.017 --> 18:41.018
Mommy's here.
( mutters )

18:45.624 --> 18:48.392
Dragons, places for
the final showdown.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.932
- Fight!
- Boy: Get him good!

18:54.934 --> 18:56.501
Boy #2:
Woo!  Yeah!

18:56.503 --> 18:58.903
( boys cheering )

18:58.905 --> 19:00.972
- Boys:  <i>Ooh!</i>
<i>- Ooh! ( laughing )</i>

19:01.974 --> 19:03.608
( screams )

19:03.610 --> 19:04.775
Boys: Ooh!

19:04.777 --> 19:05.943
( gasps )

19:05.945 --> 19:07.879
I've got an owwie!

19:07.881 --> 19:09.947
I've got a big owwie!

19:11.817 --> 19:13.618
Reggie, are you okay?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.486
Don't worry.
I'll finish him.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.788
I will not
be banished from
this dojo.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.724
Dragon heart punch!

19:19.726 --> 19:21.792
( screaming )

19:28.333 --> 19:29.333
Ugh.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.434
Okay.

19:30.436 --> 19:31.969
You've made your point.
Show's over.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.005
Dragon arm attack.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.072
( yelling )

19:37.609 --> 19:41.112
( screaming )

19:41.114 --> 19:44.749
So, I've realized that,
as my brother was beating

19:44.751 --> 19:47.618
His best friend senseless
with his own dismembered arm,

19:47.620 --> 19:51.923
I may have pushed the kids
a little bit too hard.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.130
What am I supposed to do
with these fake teeth?

19:59.132 --> 20:00.398
( spits )

20:04.503 --> 20:06.804
Dragons, I owe you
an apology.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.807
I forgot that dragon strike
martial arts is about discipline

20:09.809 --> 20:11.409
And learning how
to defend yourself,

20:11.411 --> 20:13.878
Not being top dragon.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.446
So, in order
to make it up
to all of you

20:15.448 --> 20:17.815
I am buying everyone hot dogs
at the go-kart track.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.450
Boys and dad:
( cheering )

20:19.452 --> 20:20.952
Also, dad,
can I borrow some money

20:20.954 --> 20:22.920
For hot dogs and go-karts?

20:24.756 --> 20:25.890
All right, dragons,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.592
Gather up your loose limbs

20:27.594 --> 20:30.428
And hearts and meet me
at the minivan.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.096
It's time to ride!

20:32.098 --> 20:33.431
( boys cheering )

20:34.733 --> 20:35.900
You know I'm not gonna
be holding back out there

20:35.902 --> 20:37.535
On that go-kart track,
right?

20:37.537 --> 20:39.570
I do not care if you are
in middle school, I am gonna

20:39.572 --> 20:40.905
Dominate you.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.007
I'll run you
right into a wall,
old lady.

20:43.942 --> 20:45.843
Rawr!

20:45.845 --> 20:47.979
But, like, picture that,
but, like, fire breath.

20:47.981 --> 20:49.046
( laughs )

20:54.686 --> 20:55.820
Oh, I almost forgot.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.488
( claps )
minions.

21:03.929 --> 21:04.862
What?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.564
Wait, why do you
even have this?

21:06.566 --> 21:07.965
You had no idea
that I was gonna
ask you.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.166
You were all
gaga for willow.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.136
( laughs )
oh, I was never
into willow.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.137
You were--
you nev--

21:13.139 --> 21:14.205
You what?
What?  What?

21:15.173 --> 21:17.174
It was all part
of my master plan.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.876
Allow me to explain.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.145
Minions, some
'splaining music.
( snaps fingers )

21:22.114 --> 21:24.148
( electric keyboard plays )

21:24.150 --> 21:25.616
I knew that a girl
with a taste for joey

21:25.618 --> 21:26.884
Could never feel
the same way towards

21:26.886 --> 21:29.954
An elegant, gingery flavor
such as myself.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.590
It makes
no culinary sense.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.626
I knew it had to be the work
of the queen of hearts,

21:35.628 --> 21:38.896
So I faked an obsession
with willow, giving you

21:38.898 --> 21:40.598
No choice but to jump
on the grenade for her.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.800
And that grenade
is me.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.069
Boom!  Romance!

21:46.004 --> 21:47.071
<i>( camera shutter clicks )</i>

21:50.575 --> 21:53.010
Wait, I got outplayed?

21:53.012 --> 21:55.146
You're like
an evil genius...

21:55.148 --> 21:57.682
And I'm weirdly impressed.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.116
Wait till you see me tango.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.786
<i>( tango keyboard music plays )</i>

22:22.040 --> 22:23.207
Hey, joey.

22:23.209 --> 22:24.575
Oh.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.744
Hi, willow.
You look nice.

22:26.746 --> 22:27.878
Thanks.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.146
Where's artie?

22:29.148 --> 22:31.682
It's, uh, kind of rude
to ditch your date.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.585
Joey, I never wanted
to go to the dance
with artie.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.687
I wanted to go with you,
but I thought you'd say no.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.589
Good instinct.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.992
It's too bad
I'm in this box.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.862
We could go dance
as friends.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.798
( metal clangs )

22:50.268 --> 22:51.535
( squeals )

22:53.705 --> 22:55.873
So, how about that dance?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.908
- I'm afraid to say no.
- Good instinct.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.009
( screams )

22:59.945 --> 23:02.246
At 10:02,
artie texted this

23:02.248 --> 23:04.115
To the entire school.

23:07.018 --> 23:08.953
But it was all worth it

23:08.955 --> 23:11.055
When at 10:15,

23:11.057 --> 23:12.656
I got this.
