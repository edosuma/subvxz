I'M NOT GOING TO LIE, I PREPARED

08:31.178 --> 08:32.513
FOR THIS MOMENT, YOU KNOW,

08:32.513 --> 08:35.249
THOUGHT ABOUT IT A MILLION TI

08:35.249 --> 08:38.185
TIMES, AND I THINK JUST TO ME,

08:38.185 --> 08:41.055
PERSONALLY, I'D RATHER LISTEN TO

08:41.055 --> 08:42.456
YOU, I'D RATHER HEAR YOUR SIDE,

08:42.456 --> 08:47.061
BECAUSE I MEAN, WHAT I SAW, I

08:47.061 --> 08:48.295
GUESS I HAVE MY OWN VIEWS AND

08:48.295 --> 08:49.463
OPINIONS, BUT I WOULD RATHER

08:49.463 --> 08:51.332
HEAR YOUR SIDE SO I CAN GET THE

08:51.332 --> 08:55.002
WHOLE CLARITY, AND THEN TALK

08:55.002 --> 08:56.404
MOVING FORWARD, SO.

08:56.404 --> 08:56.804
>> YEAH.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.672
>> I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO

08:58.672 --> 09:01.675
KNOW, YOU KNOW, THE DISCONNECT,

09:01.675 --> 09:03.144
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR

09:03.144 --> 09:03.344
MIND.

09:03.344 --> 09:04.345
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT

09:04.345 --> 09:06.947
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN ‐‐ OR DIDN'T

09:06.947 --> 09:07.381
SHOW.

09:07.381 --> 09:07.615
>> YEAH.

09:07.615 --> 09:11.085
>> SO, IF, YEAH.

09:11.085 --> 09:13.087
>> THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND COMING

09:13.087 --> 09:16.891
INTO IT, I KNEW THAT I WAS ABLE

09:16.891 --> 09:19.560
TO GIVE IT EVERYTHING, BUT I

09:19.560 --> 09:24.231
WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO

09:24.231 --> 09:25.099
WOULD BE ABLE TO FALL IN LOVE

09:25.099 --> 09:27.968
WITH TWO PEOPLE.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.203
JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT I EVER

09:29.203 --> 09:32.807
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE.

09:32.807 --> 09:35.976
AND AS THIS WHOLE STORY UNFOLDS,

09:35.976 --> 09:38.045
YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU ARE GIVING

09:38.045 --> 09:40.981
100%, LIKE I SAID I WAS GOING TO

09:40.981 --> 09:41.749
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, IT'S

09:41.749 --> 09:44.018
VERY POSSIBLE, AND IT'S HARD

09:44.018 --> 09:47.688
BECAUSE OF THAT, AND AS THESE

09:47.688 --> 09:50.491
DAYS WERE WINDING DOWN, AND AS I

09:50.491 --> 09:51.158
SHARED MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS

09:51.158 --> 09:54.628
WITH YOU, THOSE WERE MY TRUE,

09:54.628 --> 09:57.231
HONEST THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS.

09:57.231 --> 09:59.266
I CARED, AND I DO CARE ABOUT

09:59.266 --> 10:00.334
YOUR FEELINGS, I CARE ABOUT YOU

10:00.334 --> 10:02.770
AS A PERSON.

10:02.770 --> 10:06.106
AND MY DECISION TO SHARE THAT I

10:06.106 --> 10:10.077
WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU, I WASN'T

10:10.077 --> 10:11.378
SHARING THAT BECAUSE I ALREADY

10:11.378 --> 10:12.613
HAD MADE A DECISION.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.748
I WAS SHARING THAT BECAUSE IT

10:14.748 --> 10:15.483
WAS SOMETHING THAT I HAD BEEN

10:15.483 --> 10:20.321
HOLDING BACK, AND BECAUSE I

10:20.321 --> 10:21.555
DIDN'T THINK I WAS CAPABLE OF

10:21.555 --> 10:22.857
FALLING IN LOVE WITH TWO PEOPLE,

10:22.857 --> 10:25.125
IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO

10:25.125 --> 10:27.661
HONESTLY COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT

10:27.661 --> 10:29.296
THAT, BECAUSE IT'S SCARY AND YOU

10:29.296 --> 10:30.264
ARE DATING IN THE PUBLIC EYE AND

10:30.264 --> 10:32.199
THERE'S ALL THESE DIFFERENT

10:32.199 --> 10:32.867
THINGS.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.969
YOU KNOW, YOU DO, YOU SEE PEOPLE

10:34.969 --> 10:35.669
GET RIDICULED FOR FALLING IN

10:35.669 --> 10:38.572
LOVE WITH TWO PEOPLE, AND ‐‐

10:38.572 --> 10:40.407
>> WHICH IS VERY POSSIBLE TO

10:40.407 --> 10:41.976
FALL IN LOVE WITH TWO PEOPLE.

10:41.976 --> 10:44.178
>> WHICH IT IS, AND IT'S NOT AN

10:44.178 --> 10:45.012
EASY THING TO BE IN THIS

10:45.012 --> 10:46.780
POSITION, BUT I HAD ASK YOU GUYS

10:46.780 --> 10:48.315
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST AND

10:48.315 --> 10:49.750
VULNERABLE WITH ME THE ENTIRE

10:49.750 --> 10:51.285
TIME, AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

10:51.285 --> 10:52.720
YOU GAVE TO ME FROM THE VERY

10:52.720 --> 10:53.754
START, AND THAT IS WHY MY

10:53.754 --> 10:56.323
FEELINGS COULD GET TO THAT

10:56.323 --> 10:57.191
POINT.

10:57.191 --> 10:59.193
AND, AS I'M FEELING THOSE

10:59.193 --> 11:00.928
FEELINGS, I FELT LIKE IT WOULD

11:00.928 --> 11:03.197
ALSO DO THE RELATIONSHIP TO A

11:03.197 --> 11:06.033
DISSERVICE TO NOT SHARE THEM.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.168
AND NOW, IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN

11:08.168 --> 11:13.040
MY DECISION IN THAT MOMENT, AND

11:13.040 --> 11:14.241
STRONG FEELINGS, I AM ALWAYS A

11:14.241 --> 11:15.509
PERSON TO THINK OF SOMEBODY

11:15.509 --> 11:17.311
ELSE, BUT IN THIS UNIQUE

11:17.311 --> 11:18.846
POSITION, I WANTED TO BE

11:18.846 --> 11:19.613
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH WHERE I

11:19.613 --> 11:21.048
WAS AT, AND THAT WAS THAT I WAS

11:21.048 --> 11:24.251
IN LOVE WITH YOU, AND SAYING

11:24.251 --> 11:25.886
THAT, IT WAS HARD AT THAT TIME,

11:25.886 --> 11:29.189
BECAUSE IT'S SCARY.

11:29.189 --> 11:38.699
AND IT'S SCARY WITH ALSO KNOWING

11:38.699 --> 11:39.266
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BREAK

11:39.266 --> 11:39.867
SOMEBODY'S HEART WITH WHO YOU

11:39.867 --> 11:40.534
SAID "I LOVE YOU" TO, AND THAT'S

11:40.534 --> 11:40.935
NOT EASY, EITHER.

11:40.935 --> 11:44.071
>> YEAH, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I

11:44.071 --> 11:46.674
MEAN, GOING HOME, I WASN'T OKAY,

11:46.674 --> 11:47.541
YOU KNOW?

11:47.541 --> 11:49.543
LIKE, THANK GOD FOR, YOU KNOW,

11:49.543 --> 11:53.047
EVERYONE, BUT I JUST, I PREPARED

11:53.047 --> 11:53.881
MYSELF WATCHING IT BECAUSE I

11:53.881 --> 11:54.815
KNEW I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO

11:54.815 --> 11:56.116
WATCH IT, I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO

11:56.116 --> 11:59.954
FACE YOU AT SOME POINT, AND, I

11:59.954 --> 12:03.691
MEAN, HONESTLY, I THANK YOU,

12:03.691 --> 12:05.192
JUST BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN

12:05.192 --> 12:05.893
THAT VULNERABLE IN A

12:05.893 --> 12:07.595
RELATIONSHIP IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

12:07.595 --> 12:10.097
USUALLY I AM RESERVED.

12:10.097 --> 12:10.798
USUALLY I DON'T SHOW EMOTIONS

12:10.798 --> 12:11.832
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S

12:11.832 --> 12:12.533
GOING TO GO YET OR WHERE IT'S

12:12.533 --> 12:15.436
GOING TO LEAD TO.

12:15.436 --> 12:19.607
I THINK, YOU KNOW, JUST TO ME,

12:19.607 --> 12:20.574
IT WAS HARD WATCHING BECAUSE I

12:20.574 --> 12:21.775
WAS SO TRULY IN LOVE WITH YOU.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.211
I WAS BEYOND IN LOVE WITH YOU.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.080
YOU KNOW, I WAS IN LOVE WITH

12:26.080 --> 12:26.780
YOUR FAMILY AND EVERYTHING THAT

12:26.780 --> 12:31.051
CAME WITH THAT, AND I DON'T

12:31.051 --> 12:34.121
KNOW, IT'S ‐‐ I COME IN A WAY,

12:34.121 --> 12:36.523
LIKE, ON THE OTHER SIDE, I FELT

12:36.523 --> 12:39.293
A LITTLE BIT OF MY LOVE WAS

12:39.293 --> 12:41.362
OVERLOOKED.

12:41.362 --> 12:43.697
BUT ALSO I DIDN'T KNOW THE FULL

12:43.697 --> 12:45.432
STORY.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.401
YOU KNOW, ONLY KNEW MY PORTION,

12:47.401 --> 12:51.505
ONLY MY PART, AND, YEAH, THAT

12:51.505 --> 12:54.008
LAST DAY WAS TOUGH.

12:54.008 --> 12:56.176
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO BREAK

12:56.176 --> 12:58.846
MY HEART BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY,

12:58.846 --> 13:00.614
WITH YOU, I KNEW THAT YOU SHOW

13:00.614 --> 13:02.249
YOUR EMOTIONS THROUGH YOUR EYES.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.951
EVERYTHING YOU DO, YOU SHOW IT

13:03.951 --> 13:04.551
THROUGH YOUR EYES, AND WHEN I

13:04.551 --> 13:07.821
WALKED OUT, I SAW THAT, OF

13:07.821 --> 13:08.989
COURSE, YOUR HEART WAS POINTING

13:08.989 --> 13:12.860
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION, AND

13:12.860 --> 13:13.961
WITH THE B AND EVERYTHING THAT

13:13.961 --> 13:17.765
DIDN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER, BUT

13:17.765 --> 13:19.633
YEAH, I JUST, AT THE END OF THE

13:19.633 --> 13:21.035
DAY, I DO WISH YOU THE BEST.

13:21.035 --> 13:22.803
I WISH YOU GUYS A HAPPY, HAPPY

13:22.803 --> 13:25.706
LIFE TOGETHER, AND, YOU KNOW, I

13:25.706 --> 13:27.875
DO MISS YOUR PARENTS.

13:27.875 --> 13:34.648
I'M SO SORRY.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.316
OKAY.

13:36.316 --> 13:40.821
BUT YEAH, JUST A LITTLE

13:40.821 --> 13:41.689
CONFUSED.

13:41.689 --> 13:42.389
JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED.

13:42.389 --> 13:46.060
I SAW, YOU KNOW, THAT YOU DIDN'T

13:46.060 --> 13:49.029
WANT IT TO BE NAYTE, AND THIS IS

13:49.029 --> 13:50.431
EVERYTHING BEFORE, YOU TELLING

13:50.431 --> 13:53.367

13:53.367 --> 13:54.234
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU SHARING

13:54.234 --> 13:56.437
THAT WITH ME BECAUSE THAT IS NOT

13:56.437 --> 13:58.138
EASY, AND BREAKING SOMEONE'S

13:58.138 --> 13:58.972
HEART ISN'T EASY, BUT I JUST

13:58.972 --> 14:00.708
FELT LIKE, YOU REALLY HAD TO

14:00.708 --> 14:05.713
PUSH NAYTE TO THAT POINT, AND IT

14:05.713 --> 14:06.513
WAS JUST KIND OF CONFUSING WHEN

14:06.513 --> 14:08.015
YOU NEVER HAD TO QUESTION ME BUT

14:08.015 --> 14:09.750
YOU HAD TO KEEP QUESTIONING HIM,

14:09.750 --> 14:13.487
BUT AGAIN, LIKE, SOMETIMES WE

14:13.487 --> 14:14.288
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR HEART

14:14.288 --> 14:17.691
IS TELLING US, AND SOMETIMES,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.126
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

14:19.126 --> 14:20.994
WANT, SO I JUST, AT THE END OF

14:20.994 --> 14:22.329
THE DAY, JUST THANK YOU, BECAUSE

14:22.329 --> 14:23.897
YOU GAVE ME STRENGTH, YOU KNOW,

14:23.897 --> 14:25.666
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY DID.

14:25.666 --> 14:26.433

14:30.370 --> 14:33.207
SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE, AND YEAH.

17:12.087 --> 17:13.923
>> WELL, NAYTE, I MEAN, YOU

17:13.923 --> 17:15.124
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU WERE

17:15.124 --> 17:16.692
GETTING INTO COMING ON THE SHOW.

17:16.692 --> 17:18.994
YOU'VE NEVER WATCHED BEFORE.

17:18.994 --> 17:21.197
AT WHAT POINT DID YOU REALIZE,

17:21.197 --> 17:22.932
OH, THIS IS REAL, AND I AM

17:22.932 --> 17:23.599
FALLING IN LOVE?

17:23.599 --> 17:26.602

17:26.602 --> 17:27.970

17:27.970 --> 17:29.038
BASKETBALL DATE, THE

17:29.038 --> 17:29.705
CONVERSATION I HAD WITH

17:29.705 --> 17:31.874
MICHELLE, THAT IS WHEN I REALLY

17:31.874 --> 17:33.642
REALIZED, LIKE, I HAVE NEVER MET

17:33.642 --> 17:36.478
ANYBODY LIKE THIS BEFORE, RIGHT,

17:36.478 --> 17:38.747
AND THEN THE BEST WAY I CAN KIND

17:38.747 --> 17:39.448
OF EXPLAIN HOW I KNEW I WAS

17:39.448 --> 17:43.485
FALLING IN LOVE, OUR FIRST ONE

17:43.485 --> 17:44.286
ON ONE ‐‐ YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

17:44.286 --> 17:45.187
LISTEN TO A SONG IN THE FIRST

17:45.187 --> 17:48.424
TIME YOU LISTEN ‐‐ I'M SUPER BAD

17:48.424 --> 17:49.058
WITH ANALOGIES.

17:49.058 --> 17:50.826
MICHELLE KNOWS I AM THE CRAZIEST

17:50.826 --> 17:51.460
WITH ANALOGIES.

17:51.460 --> 17:52.061
YOU KNOW YOU LISTEN TO A SONG

17:52.061 --> 17:53.729
AND THIS IS A GOOD SONG, THEN HE

17:53.729 --> 17:55.197
WAS IN THE SECOND TIME, OKAY,

17:55.197 --> 17:56.398
THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD

17:56.398 --> 17:57.833
SONG, HE WAS INTO ANOTHER TIME,

17:57.833 --> 17:59.301
THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE SONG, BUT

17:59.301 --> 18:00.703
IT TAKES TIME ‐‐ LIKE, IT TAKES

18:00.703 --> 18:02.004
TIME FOR YOU TO REALIZE THAT

18:02.004 --> 18:04.240
THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE SONG,

18:04.240 --> 18:04.773
RIGHT?

18:04.773 --> 18:05.474
MY FIRST ONE‐ON‐ONE WITH

18:05.474 --> 18:09.645
MICHELLE, I WAS LIKE, WHERE ‐‐

18:09.645 --> 18:10.579
IT WASN'T LIKE I HAD TO LISTEN

18:10.579 --> 18:12.414
TO THE SONG EIGHT OR NINE TIMES

18:12.414 --> 18:13.682
FOR ME TO REALIZE IT'S MY

18:13.682 --> 18:14.283
FAVORITE SONG.

18:14.283 --> 18:16.585
IT WAS LIKE, I AM LITERALLY

18:16.585 --> 18:17.686
WITNESSING MYSELF FALL IN LOVE.

18:17.686 --> 18:21.090
AND IT WAS ‐‐ I JUST COULDN'T

18:21.090 --> 18:21.624
BELIEVE IT.

18:21.624 --> 18:23.492
YOU DON'T ‐‐ YOU DON'T REALIZE

18:23.492 --> 18:24.193
THAT SOMETHING IS YOUR FAVORITE

18:24.193 --> 18:25.661
SONG INTO A LISTEN TO IT A

18:25.661 --> 18:26.996
COUPLE TIMES.

18:26.996 --> 18:28.163
MICHELLE, THAT FIRST ONE‐ON‐ONE,

18:28.163 --> 18:30.699
I WAS COGNIZANT AND AWARE EVERY

18:30.699 --> 18:34.303
SECOND THAT TICKED BY I WAS

18:34.303 --> 18:36.505
FALLING IN LOVE.

18:36.505 --> 18:37.539
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.

18:37.539 --> 18:39.708
I WANT TO KNOW NOW, YOU HAVE

18:39.708 --> 18:40.743
SPENT TIME TOGETHER.

18:40.743 --> 18:42.244
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY.

18:42.244 --> 18:44.113
IT WAS A STRUGGLE FOR NAYTE TO

18:44.113 --> 18:44.580
OPEN UP.

18:44.580 --> 18:45.414
HAVE YOU CONTINUED TO LET THOSE

18:45.414 --> 18:46.382
GUARDS DOWN?

18:46.382 --> 18:49.919
ARE WE STILL BEING VULNERABLE?

18:49.919 --> 18:51.186
>> OH, YES.

18:51.186 --> 18:52.588
>> AND SHARING OUR EMOTIONS?

18:52.588 --> 18:54.823
>> HE IS MORE VULNERABLE THAN

18:54.823 --> 18:55.424
ME.

18:55.424 --> 18:55.925
>> SHUT UP!

18:55.925 --> 18:58.193
>> HE IS.

18:58.193 --> 18:59.628
YOU PUT SOMEBODY IN A POSITION

18:59.628 --> 19:00.496
WHERE THEY HAVE TO ‐‐ WHERE THEY

19:00.496 --> 19:01.830
ARE TRYING TO BE VULNERABLE,

19:01.830 --> 19:03.198
RIGHT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, FALL

19:03.198 --> 19:05.200
IN LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEN

19:05.200 --> 19:06.268
YOU STICK PRODUCERS AND CAMERAS,

19:06.268 --> 19:09.104
IT'S GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE OFF,

19:09.104 --> 19:11.106
BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, HE REALLY

19:11.106 --> 19:11.674
WAS CHALLENGING HIMSELF, AND

19:11.674 --> 19:13.676
THAT'S THE THING, LOVE DOESN'T

19:13.676 --> 19:16.879
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THIS PERFECT,

19:16.879 --> 19:18.147
INTENSE, MAGICAL STORY THAT GOES

19:18.147 --> 19:20.115
FROM START TO END WITH NO SPEED

19:20.115 --> 19:21.317
BUMPS, LIKE, YOU KNOW?

19:21.317 --> 19:22.685
THE CONVERSATIONS HE HAD WITH MY

19:22.685 --> 19:24.320
FAMILY, IT SHOWED THAT THEY WERE

19:24.320 --> 19:25.287
ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THINGS, AND

19:25.287 --> 19:26.355
THAT IS WHAT I WANTED.

19:26.355 --> 19:30.359
WITH HIM AND I, HE IS SO

19:30.359 --> 19:31.527
VULNERABLE AND GIVES SO MANY

19:31.527 --> 19:32.127
WORDS OF AFFIRMATION.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.095
I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO CHECK

19:33.095 --> 19:34.930
MYSELF AND BE LIKE, OKAY, WHAT

19:34.930 --> 19:36.332
CAN I DO FOR HIM THAT IS

19:36.332 --> 19:36.598
ROMANTIC?

19:36.598 --> 19:38.701
HE REALLY IS.

19:38.701 --> 19:40.836
>> WE LOVE TO HEAR THAT.

19:40.836 --> 19:42.838
THAT DESERVES A ROUND OF

19:42.838 --> 19:44.039
APPLAUSE.

19:44.039 --> 19:44.673
PROUD OF YOU, NAYTE.

19:44.673 --> 19:44.940
[APPLAUSE]

19:44.940 --> 19:47.476
THAT IS REALLY SWEET.

19:47.476 --> 19:49.111
WHAT GOT YOU BOTH THROUGH THE

19:49.111 --> 19:50.412
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS?

19:50.412 --> 19:51.113
BECAUSE I HAVE UNFORTUNATELY

19:51.113 --> 19:52.281
BEEN IN THE POSITION OF THE

19:52.281 --> 19:53.315
HIDING OUT AND NOT BEING ABLE TO

19:53.315 --> 19:55.184
SHARE IT, AND LIKE YOU SAID, YOU

19:55.184 --> 19:56.852
WANTED TO RUN, BUT NOW WE WANT

19:56.852 --> 19:58.020
TO RUN TO THE WORLD AND SHARE

19:58.020 --> 19:58.787
IT.

19:58.787 --> 20:00.823
WHAT GOT YOU THROUGH THOSE TWO

20:00.823 --> 20:01.490
MONTHS OF FILMING AND AIRING AND

20:01.490 --> 20:03.726
ALL OF THAT?

20:03.726 --> 20:07.663
>> I THINK WHAT'S SO HARD IS

20:07.663 --> 20:08.697
THAT YOU GO THROUGH THIS

20:08.697 --> 20:10.032
EXPERIENCE AND YOU HAVE THESE

20:10.032 --> 20:12.067
MAGICAL MOMENTS, AND YOU LEAVE,

20:14.269 --> 20:16.038
SPEND SO MUCH MORE TIME

20:16.038 --> 20:16.305

20:21.710 --> 20:22.745
AND GET SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER,

20:22.745 --> 20:24.179
AND HE HAS TO ALSO WATCH ALL

20:24.179 --> 20:25.781
THESE OTHER STORIES UNFOLD, SO

20:25.781 --> 20:27.116
NAYTE HAS TO WATCH, YOU KNOW,

20:27.116 --> 20:28.450
HAD TO WATCH ME SAYING "I LOVE

20:28.450 --> 20:31.153
YOU," AND HE HAD TO BE

20:31.153 --> 20:32.287
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THAT.

20:32.287 --> 20:33.255
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS WE

20:33.255 --> 20:36.225
COMMUNICATE THROUGH EVERYTHING,

20:36.225 --> 20:37.426
AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

20:37.426 --> 20:38.293
THIS PERFECT COMMUNICATION BUT

20:38.293 --> 20:39.461
WE BOTH KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

20:39.461 --> 20:39.828
STICK IN IT.

20:39.828 --> 20:41.263
WE ARE GOING TO NOT LET GO.

20:41.263 --> 20:43.432
WE ARE GOING TO HOLD ON, AND

20:43.432 --> 20:44.633
THAT IS THE BIGGEST PART.

20:44.633 --> 20:46.201
BECAUSE IT IS NOT EASY.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.870
THERE'S GOING TO BE

20:47.870 --> 20:49.705
UNCOMFORTABLE EMOTIONS, AND WE

20:49.705 --> 20:50.272
DEFINITELY HAD THEM.

20:50.272 --> 20:51.840

20:52.641 --> 20:53.208
