01:09.095 --> 01:11.100
What's going on?
Who are you?

01:11.135 --> 01:15.055
Oh, for God's sake, you scared
the living crap out of me then! Jesus!

01:15.090 --> 01:19.255
- Are you all right?
- I just need to sit down for a second.

01:19.290 --> 01:21.020
Oh, shit!

01:21.055 --> 01:23.100
Sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

01:23.135 --> 01:25.615
That's all right.
You haven't got a towel, have you?

01:25.650 --> 01:27.180
Yes.

01:27.215 --> 01:32.135
Thanks. It's wetter than
a nun's cucumber out there tonight.

01:32.170 --> 01:36.095
Thanks. Can you...
Can you put the gun down, please?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.220
Of course.
It's not loaded,

01:38.255 --> 01:41.935
it was just a prop from a
student production of The Seagull.

01:41.970 --> 01:44.392
Can I ask what you're
doing in my rooms?

01:44.427 --> 01:46.780
I presume you didn't
break in for a towel.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.940
Well, I... I didn't break in.
Well, not technically.

01:49.975 --> 01:53.335
My boyfriend told me all professors
keep a key above their glory hole,

01:53.370 --> 01:55.420
so I sort of just let myself in.

01:55.455 --> 01:58.575
It was a stupid thing to do.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:58.610 --> 01:59.940
And you are?

01:59.975 --> 02:03.015
Nina.
Nina... Noonah.

02:03.050 --> 02:05.500
Nina Noonah.

02:05.535 --> 02:08.975
Well, not really, obviously,
but I don't want to get in any trouble.

02:09.009 --> 02:11.980
You're... You're not going to
call the police, are you?

02:12.015 --> 02:15.415
It's all right, Miss Noonah,
my bark is worse than my bite.

02:15.450 --> 02:17.820
Just tell me why you're here.

02:17.855 --> 02:21.255
It's just Simon, my boyfriend,
he studies at King's College

02:21.290 --> 02:23.580
and he's properly clever.

02:23.615 --> 02:28.095
He's got a bike and scarf
and all the Harry Potter shit.

02:28.130 --> 02:30.415
And he's sort of obsessed
with doing the crossword.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.020
And I don't mean the
quick ones you get

02:32.055 --> 02:34.815
with a picture of Vanessa Feltz
in the middle in Chat magazine,

02:34.850 --> 02:36.895
I mean, the cryptic.

02:36.930 --> 02:38.420
I see.

02:38.455 --> 02:40.100
And I try to help him sometimes

02:40.135 --> 02:42.215
and I... I look at the clues
and I feel like such a div

02:42.250 --> 02:44.292
because I can't
make head nor tail of them.

02:44.327 --> 02:46.300
They may as well be
written in Chinese!

02:46.335 --> 02:49.695
In Mandarin, yes.
And you're a student also?

02:49.730 --> 02:53.860
Oh, God, no! No.
I... I work at Greggs.

02:53.895 --> 02:56.700
I'm what you call...
emotionally intelligent.

02:56.735 --> 02:59.855
Well, sadly,
that won't help you with the cryptic.

02:59.890 --> 03:01.540
Sorry.

03:01.575 --> 03:03.420
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:03.455 --> 03:05.900
Anyway, Simon reckons you're
the Sphinx, or something.

03:05.935 --> 03:09.255
- Do you write the crossword in the student paper?
- That's correct.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.975
Crossword-setters traditionally
use a pseudonym, a made-up name.

03:13.010 --> 03:15.175
- What, like Nina Noonah?
- Yes.

03:15.210 --> 03:18.655
And I am know as the Sphinx.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.900
It's not exactly a secret,
especially here on campus.

03:23.935 --> 03:27.935
Anyway, I just thought that if I could maybe
see the answers to this week's crossword,

03:27.970 --> 03:30.592
then I could sit with
Simon and be, like,

03:30.627 --> 03:33.180
"18-down, do you think
that's Parachute?"

03:33.215 --> 03:37.335
And he'd be like,
"Yeah! Wow, you're so clever, and..."

03:37.370 --> 03:39.815
It was only meant to be a joke.
I'm really sorry.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.100
No, no, no, I quite understand.

03:42.135 --> 03:44.815
We all crave approbation
on some level.

03:46.335 --> 03:49.175
Tell me, what does your
boyfriend study, Miss Noonah?

03:49.210 --> 03:51.495
- Architecture.
- Architecture?

03:52.695 --> 03:54.180
Well, I teach.

03:54.215 --> 03:56.735
Yeah, I know.
I didn't think you were a student.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.180
Simon says you teach Classics.

03:58.215 --> 04:01.415
Is that, like, Gone With The Wind
and Pretty Woman and that?

04:01.450 --> 04:03.775
I teach wild creature
without hospital building.

04:06.855 --> 04:09.975
- Sorry, what?
- I teach...

04:10.010 --> 04:12.380
wild creature...

04:12.415 --> 04:15.775
without hospital building.

04:17.615 --> 04:20.820
- 12 letters.
- It's a clue!

04:20.855 --> 04:25.335
Yes. Not a very good one, I admit,
since you put me on the spot.

04:25.370 --> 04:30.455
So... A cryptic clue
always offers up two means of solution.

04:30.490 --> 04:32.692
The beginning or the
end of the sentence

04:32.727 --> 04:34.860
gives you the
definition of the word.

04:34.895 --> 04:37.675
Much as you might get
in a standard vanilla crossword.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.542
And the rest of the clue
is the wordplay, if you like,

04:40.577 --> 04:43.375
- which is a kind of riddle.
- Like on Catchphrase?

04:43.410 --> 04:45.140
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

04:45.175 --> 04:50.535
So, here we have a 12-letter word,
meaning "I teach", or "building".

04:50.570 --> 04:52.620
Now, here we have
the word "wild",

04:52.655 --> 04:56.140
which is what we refer to
as an anagram-indicator.

04:56.175 --> 04:58.895
It suggests the letters
can be jumbled up and rearranged.

04:58.930 --> 05:02.735
So anything such as
"upset", "excited", "insane".

05:02.770 --> 05:05.112
- Mashed up!
- Yes, if you like.

05:05.147 --> 05:07.501
- Wankered!
- That type of thing.

05:07.536 --> 05:09.820
It's telling us to
mix up the letters.

05:09.855 --> 05:12.860
So if we take the words
"I teach" and "creature"

05:12.895 --> 05:16.975
and make them "wild",
we might come up with a solution.

05:17.010 --> 05:18.700
OK, but that's too many letters.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.635
Yes, very good.
We're two letters over.

05:21.670 --> 05:24.500
So we look here,
"without hospital".

05:24.535 --> 05:27.915
Now, in terms of letters,
what could "hospital" be?

05:27.950 --> 05:31.260
- H?
- Yeah, but we need two letters, remember.

05:31.295 --> 05:35.055
If you were to have an accident,
if I'd shot you here in the dark...

05:35.090 --> 05:36.500
What, with an empty gun?
Good luck.

05:36.535 --> 05:40.215
But if I had, you'd head
straight for which department?

05:40.250 --> 05:42.300
- A&E?
- Excellent!

05:42.335 --> 05:44.855
So if we remove "A"
and "E" from "creature"

05:44.890 --> 05:47.220
ie "creature without hospital",

05:47.255 --> 05:51.495
and mix it up with "I teach",
then we get an anagram of 12 letters

05:51.530 --> 05:55.295
- meaning "building", which is...?
- Sorry, what?

05:55.330 --> 05:58.140
Architecture!

05:58.175 --> 06:00.300
See?
Not so hard, was it?

06:00.335 --> 06:02.380
Is that in this
week's crossword, then?

06:02.415 --> 06:04.980
No, no, no, no.
I haven't parsed it properly.

06:05.015 --> 06:08.095
I buried the anagram-indicator
in the fodder, but...

06:08.130 --> 06:09.820
it was simply an illustration.

06:09.855 --> 06:12.215
What, in Pictionary,
you can draw it?

06:12.250 --> 06:13.980
No.

06:14.015 --> 06:15.375
No, I was...

06:16.415 --> 06:17.735
I was just showing off.

06:18.775 --> 06:20.615
Trying to give you some insight.

06:20.650 --> 06:22.175
I'm sorry.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.375
OK, then, Professor.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.495
Sorry I woke you.

06:29.530 --> 06:30.895
It's Nigel.

06:32.135 --> 06:33.695
Nina.

06:35.415 --> 06:36.975
Bye.

06:41.295 --> 06:44.655
If you like, I can show you
the clues to tomorrow's crossword,

06:44.690 --> 06:46.455
see if any of them make sense.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.912
- You'd teach me?
- Yes.

06:48.947 --> 06:51.300
I teach wild creature?

06:51.335 --> 06:55.895
It's not quite Pygmalion, but...
I can give you some pointers.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.815
Here.

06:59.015 --> 07:00.980
Have a look.

07:01.015 --> 07:03.415
The answers all go in this grid.

07:05.615 --> 07:08.535
Have a look at one-across
and I'll make us some tea.

07:11.735 --> 07:16.335
"To wound and wander
destitute (4, 3, 3)"

07:16.370 --> 07:18.580
So, is this another nanagram?

07:18.615 --> 07:23.055
Possibly. Look for a verb or an adjective
that suggests movement.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.855
- Wander?
- Bingo!

07:35.775 --> 07:37.835
So, how many of
these have you done?

07:37.870 --> 07:39.860
Crosswords?
Four or five hundred.

07:39.895 --> 07:43.295
You must have a
very devious mind.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.260
It has been said.

07:45.295 --> 07:48.775
The Sphinx is a mythical creature
of Greek legend.

07:50.415 --> 07:52.660
A woman's head on a lion's body.

07:52.695 --> 07:55.980
She guarded the gates
of the ancient city of Thebes.

07:56.015 --> 07:59.735
Any traveller wishing to pass through
had first to solve her riddle.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.820
If they failed the test,
she would kill them

08:01.855 --> 08:06.495
by means of asphyxiation and then...
eat the remains.

08:08.295 --> 08:10.580
No pressure, then.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.740
She was devious and deadly.

08:12.775 --> 08:15.940
Perfect for a
cryptic crossword-setter.

08:15.975 --> 08:19.215
- "Down-and-out, meaning destitute."
- Excellent!

08:19.250 --> 08:21.300
By Jove, she's got it!

08:21.335 --> 08:22.575
Well, put it up on the grid.

08:30.895 --> 08:32.575
Is that what all
the cups are for?

08:32.610 --> 08:34.059
- Sorry?
- In the cabinet.

08:34.095 --> 08:37.914
Yes.
The Cambridge Cruciverbalist Club, the CCC.

08:37.950 --> 08:41.735
Much like the KKK,
only slightly less benevolent.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.255
Is this...
Is this your wife?

08:44.290 --> 08:45.980
Monica, yes.

08:46.015 --> 08:47.815
Does she do the crossword?

08:47.850 --> 08:50.232
She did.
She died last year.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.615
Sorry.
Did you have kids?

08:52.650 --> 08:54.260
No, no.

08:54.295 --> 08:58.015
There is no more sombre enemy of
good art than the pram in the hall.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.740
Well, you've
certainly won a lot.

09:00.775 --> 09:03.695
It's not exactly the
boat race, though, is it?

09:03.730 --> 09:06.060
How do you mean?

09:06.095 --> 09:09.500
Well, you can't beat someone
at a crossword, can you?

09:09.535 --> 09:13.535
I don't know, competitive solving
can be quite combative, believe me.

09:13.570 --> 09:15.660
Blood has been spilt.

09:15.695 --> 09:17.780
Metaphorically, of course.

09:17.815 --> 09:20.115
What's black and
white and red all over?

09:20.150 --> 09:22.415
The Cambridge
crossword competition.

09:22.450 --> 09:24.412
Or a nun chewing a razorblade.

09:24.447 --> 09:26.340
Or a penguin with sunburn.

09:26.375 --> 09:29.015
I've got one, but it's
quite rude, though.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.620
I teach Catullus, dear,
I'm hardly a prude.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.975
What's long and hard and full of seamen?
A submarine.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.300
Very good.

09:38.335 --> 09:41.615
- And what's pink and hard in the mornings? The...
- A cock?

09:42.855 --> 09:44.735
...Financial Times' crossword.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.460
Have a look at...
two-down.

09:49.495 --> 09:52.975
"This cover sounds
like a 50 Cent song."

09:53.010 --> 09:54.900
Is that, like, a cover version?

09:54.935 --> 09:56.695
"Sounds like"
indicates a homophone.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.892
Do you know what a homophone is?

09:58.927 --> 10:01.491
Is it an app for gays,
like Grinder?

10:01.526 --> 10:04.020
No.
It's two words which sound the same,

10:04.055 --> 10:07.315
but which are spelt differently,
like "their" and "there".

10:07.350 --> 10:10.575
- Where?
- Think of a four-letter word meaning "to cover",

10:10.610 --> 10:14.695
which sounds like a type of song.
Beginning with W?

10:16.455 --> 10:19.555
- Wrap!
- Correct! That's two in two minutes!

10:19.590 --> 10:22.655
You'll be challenging
for the Cup before long.

10:24.015 --> 10:26.140
And, of course, one-down,

10:26.175 --> 10:28.895
"Indian national product of
French-Italian agreement",

10:28.930 --> 10:30.900
is simply "of" in French,

10:30.935 --> 10:33.335
followed by an Italian
form of agreement,

10:33.370 --> 10:36.272
making "Desi" a
person from India.

10:36.307 --> 10:39.140
Why do you use such
difficult words?

10:39.175 --> 10:43.215
Every word is chosen
for its letters, Nina.

10:43.250 --> 10:46.575
For example, have
a look at 18-across.

10:49.175 --> 10:52.855
18-across:
"Tory leader on board for English flower."

10:52.890 --> 10:56.535
- So that's a five-letter word for Tory leader.
- Or...?

10:58.735 --> 11:01.375
English flower?
Poppy!

11:01.410 --> 11:03.100
- No.
- Daisy?

11:03.135 --> 11:06.615
Don't guess, Nina, dear.
Deduct!

11:07.855 --> 11:09.975
And don't take
anything for granted.

11:13.935 --> 11:17.415
Now...
What could "Tory leader" be?

11:17.450 --> 11:20.895
- Boris?
- No. Look at the word!

11:25.295 --> 11:27.375
- T.
- That's right!

11:27.410 --> 11:29.420
The leader of Tory is T.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.135
So put T on to a four-letter
word for "board"...

11:33.815 --> 11:36.515
- Plank! - Four letters.
- Wood. T-wood!

11:36.550 --> 11:39.215
A board has more than
one meaning, remember.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.940
- Fed up?
- No.

11:40.975 --> 11:43.575
- Cardboard? Snowboard?
- What kind of board do you pay?

11:43.610 --> 11:45.260
The exam board!

11:45.295 --> 11:48.940
No. Rent!
You pay to board somewhere.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.935
So put Tory leader "T" onto "rent",
it gives you...

11:51.970 --> 11:54.992
Trent!
But that... that's not a flower.

11:55.027 --> 11:58.015
- Who said it was a flower?
- You did!

11:58.050 --> 11:59.780
No, you said flower.

11:59.815 --> 12:03.455
What I actually
wrote was "flow-er".

12:03.490 --> 12:05.020
Something that flows.

12:05.055 --> 12:09.095
In this instance, an English
river called the Trent.

12:09.130 --> 12:12.455
Oh, my God, that is...
That's so clever!

12:12.490 --> 12:15.375
I knew you were devious!

12:20.015 --> 12:22.695
- It's very satisfying, isn't it?
- It is.

12:25.615 --> 12:30.015
So... Your boyfriend is reading architecture
at King's, is that correct?

12:30.050 --> 12:33.575
- Yeah.
- Is he studying under Pugh or Fairbrother?

12:33.610 --> 12:35.220
The first one.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.135
And how's he getting
on with old Pugh?

12:38.170 --> 12:39.972
He likes him.

12:40.007 --> 12:41.831
Gladys Pugh.

12:41.866 --> 12:43.620
He likes her.

12:43.655 --> 12:45.900
You do realise that
Pugh and Fairbrother

12:45.935 --> 12:48.735
are characters from the
comedy series Hi-de-Hi?

12:50.375 --> 12:52.655
I've...
I've not seen it.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.820
Well, lucky you.

12:54.855 --> 12:59.455
So, Simon, if that's his real
name, isn't a student at all.

12:59.490 --> 13:01.575
He's a muggle, just like you.

13:04.055 --> 13:06.180
Why did you lie?

13:06.215 --> 13:09.335
Because I didn't think you'd
take me seriously otherwise.

13:09.370 --> 13:12.340
Does he work in Greggs also?

13:12.375 --> 13:15.895
Don't patronise me, Professor, I...
I only want to learn.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.075
Of course.

13:19.110 --> 13:21.055
Nine-across!

13:22.655 --> 13:27.615
"Degas evacuated and bathed
before putting big picture in bog."

13:27.650 --> 13:31.295
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
- Patience, Nina, dear.

13:31.330 --> 13:32.700
Now, "Degas evacuated".

13:32.735 --> 13:34.660
If you evacuate something,
you clear it out.

13:34.695 --> 13:38.975
So we remove the middle letters to leave "DS".
With me?

13:39.010 --> 13:40.540
"Bathed" is another
word for "swam",

13:40.575 --> 13:46.375
so "bathed before" means we
put "swam" in front of "DS".

13:46.410 --> 13:48.540
And "putting big picture in".

13:48.575 --> 13:51.815
We need to insert another word
for a big picture, a grand scheme, a...

13:51.850 --> 13:54.420
- Plan.
- Plan! Precisely!

13:54.455 --> 13:57.255
So we put "plan"
between "swam" and "DS"

13:57.290 --> 13:59.572
to make "swamplands",
meaning "bog"! Yes?

13:59.607 --> 14:01.820
- Yes?
- Well, shouldn't it be "bogs"?

14:01.855 --> 14:04.815
- Not necessarily.
- You said it has to be precise.

14:04.850 --> 14:07.140
Yes, it is precise.
Not a word wasted.

14:07.175 --> 14:10.215
- Otherwise you'd be cheating, wouldn't you?
- I never cheat. Never!

14:18.015 --> 14:19.935
Have...
Have something to drink.

14:22.015 --> 14:25.095
Let's...
Let's have a bash at three-down, shall we?

14:25.130 --> 14:26.740
That should be easy.

14:26.775 --> 14:29.655
"A disturbed setter
concealed a tiny amount.

14:29.690 --> 14:32.535
"Why, it's enough to
take one's breath away."

14:33.695 --> 14:36.900
Well, the
crossword-setter is you,

14:36.935 --> 14:41.935
so, have you concealed
a tiny amount, Mr Sphinx? Maybe.

14:41.970 --> 14:49.015
So it's "A",
followed by an anagram of "Sphinx"

14:49.050 --> 14:53.780
and "tiny amount" is "iota",

14:53.815 --> 14:56.935
which is also the ninth letter
of the Greek alphabet,

14:56.970 --> 15:00.392
which I'm sure you know,
Professor Squires.

15:00.427 --> 15:03.815
And "why" is a homophone
of the letter "Y".

15:03.850 --> 15:08.375
Meaning:
To take one's breath away.

15:10.215 --> 15:12.755
It's rather prescient,
don't you think?

15:12.790 --> 15:15.322
I spotted it as soon
as I saw the clues.

15:15.357 --> 15:17.820
Some fairly easy ones
this week, I thought.

15:17.855 --> 15:21.895
A little bit vanilla for the King
of the Cambridge Cruciverbalists.

15:21.930 --> 15:24.872
"Dickens character undertakes
to be a cabinet maker."

15:24.907 --> 15:27.815
Well, that's obviously
Sowerberry from Oliver Twist.

15:27.850 --> 15:30.455
You'll be needing his
services before long.

15:30.490 --> 15:33.735
"Some smart aleck,
no wit, allegedly."

15:33.770 --> 15:36.015
Know-it-all.

15:37.655 --> 15:40.140
But you don't know
it all, do you, Prof?

15:40.175 --> 15:43.535
You didn't know, for example,
that I study Marine Biology.

15:43.570 --> 15:46.420
And what's the porpoise
of that, you might ask?

15:46.455 --> 15:49.335
Well, for one, I could get
my hands on some tetrodotoxin

15:49.370 --> 15:51.180
from the liver of a puffer fish.

15:51.215 --> 15:53.855
Highly toxic, as all the
best sushi chefs know.

15:53.890 --> 15:57.700
And, if consumed in,
say, a cup of tea,

15:57.735 --> 16:01.655
could lead to the gradual
paralysis of the internal organs,

16:01.690 --> 16:03.500
starting with the diaphragm.

16:03.535 --> 16:07.415
Resulting in respiratory
failure and death by three-down,

16:07.450 --> 16:09.935
the asphyxiation of the Sphinx.

16:13.135 --> 16:15.420
Simon was my brother.

16:15.455 --> 16:19.215
He got to the final of the
crossword competition six years ago.

16:19.250 --> 16:24.220
And he won!
He beat you fair and square!

16:24.255 --> 16:27.235
But you challenged him on a word.
Do you remember?

16:27.270 --> 16:30.215
"Auteur" saying the first
U looked more like a V.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.940
And the committee
found in your favour.

16:31.975 --> 16:34.495
The old boys' network
looking after their own.

16:34.530 --> 16:36.852
And Simon was disqualified.

16:36.887 --> 16:39.140
Do you know what he did?

16:39.175 --> 16:41.455
Do you, you pathetic old man?

16:43.375 --> 16:47.655
He went to his room and took
off his belt and hung himself.

16:49.015 --> 16:50.995
I'm afraid that's
incorrect, Miss Noonah.

16:51.030 --> 16:52.940
Pictures can be hung,
people are hanged.

16:52.975 --> 16:55.195
"He hanged himself", is
the correct conjugation,

16:55.230 --> 16:57.415
for which, of course, you
have my deepest sympathy.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.495
What the fuck?!
You're supposed to be dead!

16:59.530 --> 17:02.695
On the contrary.
I am very much alive.

17:04.895 --> 17:06.415
It's you who are dead.

17:07.775 --> 17:10.020
Will you permit me?

17:10.055 --> 17:14.255
22-down: "What is a frankfurter's
number-one bun? Don't start."

17:14.290 --> 17:17.712
Well, if we don't start "one" or "bun"
we get "neun",

17:17.747 --> 17:21.099
which is a number,
if you happen to come from Frankfurt.

17:21.135 --> 17:26.454
And 23-down: "The origins of a species
popularised savage serpents".

17:26.490 --> 17:28.940
"Origins" telling us
to take the first letters of,

17:28.975 --> 17:33.135
"a species popularised savage",
giving us the serpents.

17:33.170 --> 17:34.700
So?

17:34.735 --> 17:37.895
So there it is,
hiding in plain sight.

17:39.335 --> 17:46.095
I... swapped... cups.

17:48.695 --> 17:50.340
Very prescient, as you say,

17:50.375 --> 17:53.495
but the individual's urge for
self-preservation is a strong one.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.012
You bastard!

17:55.047 --> 17:56.460
Oh, please!

17:56.495 --> 17:58.375
No unnecessary violence.

18:07.855 --> 18:09.335
It's me.

18:09.370 --> 18:10.780
Yes, she is.

18:10.815 --> 18:13.015
Your services will
soon be required.

18:15.295 --> 18:19.655
That was Dr Tyler, your
personal tutor and confidant.

18:19.690 --> 18:22.335
He's on his way over
now with the vaccine.

18:22.370 --> 18:24.095
- He told you?
- Yes.

18:25.175 --> 18:27.060
He...
He wouldn't do that.

18:27.095 --> 18:29.695
Well, I'm afraid he
felt it was his duty.

18:31.055 --> 18:34.815
A brilliant student midway through
a master's degree in Marine Biology,

18:34.850 --> 18:37.980
but driven by a dark
desire for revenge.

18:38.015 --> 18:42.295
You needed his expertise to
extract the poison from the poisson,

18:42.330 --> 18:45.095
and he came straight
around to tell me.

18:46.215 --> 18:48.135
We go back a long
way, Tyler and I.

18:52.175 --> 18:54.855
Here!
Let me help you.

18:59.535 --> 19:01.255
Why...
Why don't you call the police?

19:01.290 --> 19:02.700
Sorry, what was that?

19:02.735 --> 19:05.180
Why...
don't you call the police?

19:05.215 --> 19:09.455
Well, why call the police when we can have
a little bit of fun with the crossword?

19:09.490 --> 19:13.615
It's these kind of challenges
that keep one's mind active.

19:13.650 --> 19:16.015
Let's have a
crack at five-down.

19:18.335 --> 19:22.935
"Knocked back beer and wine, then
put on one French undergarment."

19:22.970 --> 19:25.780
Any thoughts?

19:25.815 --> 19:29.975
Well, "knocked back" is telling us
to write something in reverse.

19:30.010 --> 19:34.335
In this instance,
a type of beer, "pils",

19:34.370 --> 19:37.220
and a type of wine, "red".

19:37.255 --> 19:40.935
Then, if we put on "one" in French,
which is "un",

19:40.970 --> 19:44.175
we get our undergarment.
See?

19:44.210 --> 19:47.015
"Un-der-slip."

19:48.575 --> 19:51.295
Do young women still wear underslips,
I wonder?

19:53.615 --> 19:57.175
I always found it quite sexy,
having an extra layer to tackle.

19:59.535 --> 20:02.455
Made the game rather
more interesting.

20:12.855 --> 20:15.815
Now, if you'll excuse me,
nature calls.

20:43.215 --> 20:45.420
Charlotte?

20:45.455 --> 20:47.815
You hang on in there, OK?

20:49.575 --> 20:51.055
Won't be long now.

20:52.255 --> 20:54.095
Crossword.

20:58.295 --> 21:02.775
"I hear American poet solved
the riddle of the pseudo-hotel patron."

21:02.810 --> 21:06.215
The American poet is Edgar Guest.
Mr E Guest.

21:06.250 --> 21:09.172
"A riddle solved"
is a mystery guessed

21:09.207 --> 21:12.095
and a "pseudo-hotel
patron" is a...?

21:12.130 --> 21:15.300
Mystery guest.
Very clever.

21:15.335 --> 21:18.575
Where have you been?
You said you'd be waiting outside.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.895
I had to go via my office
to pick up some things.

21:23.655 --> 21:26.815
A bit bloody dangerous, leaving me
alone with a girl in this condition.

21:28.295 --> 21:30.340
It was all I could do
not to slip her one.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.535
Oh, no, I don't think
that would be appropriate.

21:32.570 --> 21:34.140
I'm a red-blooded
mammal, Tyler,

21:34.175 --> 21:37.335
not like those bloody molluscs
you spend half your time with.

21:37.370 --> 21:39.900
She's still breathing,
I take it?

21:39.935 --> 21:44.655
Yes. The body can survive
in this state for up to six hours.

21:44.690 --> 21:47.495
She can still see
and feel and hear everything,

21:47.530 --> 21:49.775
she just...
can't move.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.540
It's horrible.

21:51.575 --> 21:53.695
Yes.
Well, let's not feel too sorry for her,

21:53.730 --> 21:55.815
that's what she wanted
to do to me, remember?

21:57.175 --> 21:59.015
- Well, go on, then.
- Sorry?

21:59.050 --> 22:00.812
Give her the antidote.

22:00.847 --> 22:02.575
There is no antidote.

22:04.535 --> 22:07.295
- What?
- For tetrodotoxin poisoning. She needs her stomach pumped.

22:07.330 --> 22:09.020
Some aggressive
airway management

22:09.055 --> 22:11.375
and an intravenous drip
as soon as possible,

22:11.410 --> 22:13.695
otherwise she'll be
dead within half an hour.

22:13.730 --> 22:15.592
But...
But you said six hours!

22:15.627 --> 22:17.420
Only with hospital treatment.

22:17.455 --> 22:20.255
Shit!
Right, well, let's do it, then.

22:21.735 --> 22:23.620
No.

22:23.655 --> 22:26.220
There's something I
want you to do first.

22:26.255 --> 22:29.215
- Is that going in this week's Varsity?
- What?!

22:29.250 --> 22:31.340
- The crossword.
- Yes.

22:31.375 --> 22:34.935
W... W... W... What's going on?
What are you doing?!

22:36.695 --> 22:38.175
I want you to eat her.

22:39.255 --> 22:41.940
Not all of her, of
course, just a sliver.

22:41.975 --> 22:45.375
Just enough that you can
say you devoured your victim.

22:47.295 --> 22:50.535
Jacob, what...?
Have you lost your mind?!

22:52.775 --> 22:55.100
When the Sphinx posed
her riddle to the Thebans,

22:55.135 --> 22:58.495
she strangled and ate anyone
who failed to answer correctly.

22:58.530 --> 23:01.255
That's right, isn't it?
I haven't misremembered it?

23:01.290 --> 23:02.780
Yes.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.335
What was the riddle again?

23:06.455 --> 23:07.780
I won't do this, Jacob.

23:07.815 --> 23:10.375
"What creature walks on
four legs in the morning,

23:10.410 --> 23:13.340
"two at noon and
three in the evening?"

23:13.375 --> 23:17.015
It's like something out of a Christmas
cracker rather than a Greek tragedy, isn't it?

23:17.050 --> 23:20.415
And it was Oedipus who gave the correct answer
- man.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.292
He crawls as a baby,

23:22.327 --> 23:24.100
then walks on two legs,

23:24.135 --> 23:26.735
before needing a
stick in his old age.

23:28.415 --> 23:30.415
A bit like you, Nigel.

23:31.775 --> 23:34.855
So...
Do you prefer leg or breast?

23:34.890 --> 23:37.252
That's it,
I'm calling the police.

23:37.287 --> 23:39.580
And tell them what exactly?

23:39.615 --> 23:41.780
That you're the victim
of a student prank?

23:41.815 --> 23:44.175
In 25 minutes, you'll have
a dead girl in your rooms

23:44.210 --> 23:45.820
in the middle of the night.

23:45.855 --> 23:49.075
You found out who she was, she
threatened you, so you killed her.

23:49.110 --> 23:52.295
No! I'll tell them the truth...
I'll say it was an accident.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.340
Well, then,
how do you explain this?

23:54.375 --> 23:57.375
You compiled this crossword
two days ago.

23:57.410 --> 23:59.340
It proves premeditation.

23:59.375 --> 24:04.415
The know-it-all received
a mystery guest at number neun

24:04.450 --> 24:08.015
and before long,
there's an asphyxiation.

24:08.050 --> 24:09.300
What's seven-down?

24:09.335 --> 24:11.140
"Catch a train before
a poisonous bite."

24:11.175 --> 24:15.015
Well, "catch" usually stands for "fish",
I know that much.

24:15.050 --> 24:17.815
"A train before" could be "puffer".

24:17.850 --> 24:23.015
So, yeah, "puffer fish".

24:24.975 --> 24:27.295
You even
concealed the murder weapon.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.580
I knew you
wouldn't be able to resist.

24:29.615 --> 24:32.100
This was just a bit of fun,
I was trying to teach the girl!

24:32.135 --> 24:35.415
You're publishing this in the
student paper for everyone to see.

24:35.450 --> 24:37.380
It's classic psychopathic behaviour.

24:37.415 --> 24:40.255
Tomorrow morning,
it'll be in every cubbyhole in Cambridge.

24:40.290 --> 24:43.735
And on the inside back
page is your confession.

24:44.815 --> 24:47.420
And when a "down-and-out"
finds the girl

24:47.455 --> 24:52.180
"wrapped" in her "underslip"
floating in the "swamplands",

24:52.215 --> 24:55.055
well, the police won't have to look
very far for the culprit, will they?

24:55.090 --> 24:57.220
- That isn't what happened!
- No, but it could do.

24:57.255 --> 25:00.175
A little drive out to the Fens,
acquaint our brilliant student

25:00.210 --> 25:03.112
with some of the marine
life she loves so much.

25:03.147 --> 25:06.321
You see, you're not
in charge of this situation.

25:06.356 --> 25:09.705
You can't fit it all neatly
into a 15-squared grid.

25:09.740 --> 25:13.055
This is messy and illogical
and out of control.

25:13.090 --> 25:14.740
This is my revenge, Nigel.

25:14.775 --> 25:17.935
So sit down whilst
I prepare your food!

25:19.695 --> 25:22.015
But she's your student,
for God's sake!

25:22.050 --> 25:23.735
No!

25:28.575 --> 25:30.575
I think I'll take
a bit off the rump.

26:02.415 --> 26:05.295
Why don't you
tell Nina the story?

26:05.330 --> 26:06.780
I bet she'd like to hear it.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.695
Keep her mind active
as her body seizes up.

26:12.255 --> 26:17.495
Jacob and I were...
students here almost 30 years ago.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.220
We roomed together for a while,

26:21.255 --> 26:25.055
then he met Monica, a
physicist from Keeble.

26:25.090 --> 26:26.820
They were madly in love.

26:26.855 --> 26:29.455
They were madly in love, they...
married,

26:29.490 --> 26:31.655
they even had two
children, twins.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.135
But Monica and I...
We began an affair.

26:38.015 --> 26:40.575
I didn't mean for it to
end up the way it did!

26:40.610 --> 26:42.540
I was about to
begin my doctorate,

26:42.575 --> 26:45.455
which probably would have
led to a teaching post,

26:45.490 --> 26:48.295
a room of my own, very
much like this one.

26:48.330 --> 26:51.935
But instead, I divorced my wife,

26:51.970 --> 26:53.980
took my babies away,

26:54.015 --> 26:56.935
to bring them up by myself,
in the Brecon Beacons.

26:58.975 --> 27:01.140
Here.
I haven't seasoned it,

27:01.175 --> 27:05.695
I didn't want to take away from the...
natural flavour.

27:07.015 --> 27:08.855
Jacob, this is...

27:10.335 --> 27:12.540
...this is preposterous!

27:12.575 --> 27:17.415
Eat it, or else I let the girl die
and you rot in prison.

27:30.855 --> 27:32.695
It tastes like
chicken, apparently.

27:34.255 --> 27:36.135
But, then, doesn't everything?

27:52.815 --> 27:55.860
And so, the mighty Sphinx

27:55.895 --> 27:58.815
consumes the flesh
of his conquest.

28:02.895 --> 28:05.255
I always hated
cryptic crosswords.

28:06.415 --> 28:09.815
Why can't people just say what they mean,
rather than trying to trick you all the time?

28:09.850 --> 28:12.780
It's when my son started
getting into them I wasn't happy.

28:12.815 --> 28:16.495
Became obsessed with entering
the stupid Cambridge crossword competition.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.975
Perhaps he thought he could
re-earn his mother's love

28:21.010 --> 28:24.015
by beating her new husband,
I don't know.

28:24.050 --> 28:26.060
Simon was your son?

28:26.095 --> 28:28.935
He entered the competition
under a pseudonym.

28:28.970 --> 28:30.900
You knew him as Rex.

28:30.935 --> 28:33.155
After Oedipus Rex,
the play by Sophocles.

28:33.190 --> 28:35.375
But you cheated him
out of his victory.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.180
But that means...

28:37.215 --> 28:40.795
Charlotte and I, we hatched
our revenge plan, didn't we?

28:40.830 --> 28:44.375
We said we would bring down
that cheating Professor Squires

28:44.410 --> 28:46.815
if it was the last thing we did.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.135
And it may well be.

28:49.575 --> 28:51.275
At least for her.

28:51.310 --> 28:52.975
She's your daughter?

28:54.495 --> 28:57.575
It's crazy, isn't it,
what the unhinged mind is capable of?

28:57.610 --> 29:00.975
But she came here tonight to kill me,
to poison me!

29:01.010 --> 29:02.860
That was the plan.

29:02.895 --> 29:04.855
So, why did you
tell me about it?

29:06.055 --> 29:08.020
Just so I'd do the crossword?

29:08.055 --> 29:09.975
Pretty much, yes.
I needed leverage.

29:12.455 --> 29:15.215
You sacrificed your only
daughter just to get at me?

29:15.250 --> 29:18.940
Well, that's the thing, you see.

29:18.975 --> 29:22.095
When Simon died,
there was an autopsy.

29:22.130 --> 29:24.212
Quite a thorough investigation.

29:24.247 --> 29:26.295
It turns out they're not my kids.

29:28.175 --> 29:29.615
They're yours.

29:30.975 --> 29:34.015
I always suspected that affair
started before you said it did.

29:34.050 --> 29:35.780
Oh, God!

29:35.815 --> 29:37.655
So there I was.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.015
I'd given up everything.

29:41.050 --> 29:42.415
My wife...

29:43.975 --> 29:45.795
...my home, my job.

29:45.830 --> 29:47.562
My entire life.

29:47.597 --> 29:49.260
All for a lie.

29:49.295 --> 29:53.695
So I'm sure you understand, Nigel,
why I had to seek my revenge.

29:53.730 --> 29:55.775
Help me get her
to a hospital, please!

29:55.810 --> 29:57.575
I think we're past that now.

29:58.655 --> 30:01.135
Just enjoy the time
you have left together.

30:02.775 --> 30:05.135
A little present for you there, Nigel.

30:06.455 --> 30:08.595
You know what Anton said.

30:08.630 --> 30:10.700
Never show a gun in Act One

30:10.735 --> 30:13.095
if you're not going
to fire it by Act Five.

30:14.535 --> 30:16.415
Otherwise people feel cheated.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.775
Isn't your middle name Hector,
by the way?

30:25.810 --> 30:27.180
Yes.

30:27.215 --> 30:28.775
How funny.
