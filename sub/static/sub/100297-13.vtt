WEBVTT

00:03.573 --> 00:05.959
And Zhang Ziyi is incredible in it.

00:05.961 --> 00:08.324
Her character, Xiao Mei, is a dancer,

00:08.326 --> 00:10.062
- Uh-huh.
- but she's really part

00:10.064 --> 00:12.062
of the anti-government underground.

00:12.064 --> 00:13.496
And the corrupt officials

00:13.498 --> 00:16.335
send police to spy on her but...

00:18.369 --> 00:19.607
... one of them,

00:19.609 --> 00:21.973
played by Takeshi Kaneshiro,

00:21.975 --> 00:23.435
- falls in love with her.
- Oh.

00:23.437 --> 00:25.893
And so he doesn't tell the
police what's really going on.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.412
- Lots of twists, lots of intrigue.
- Oh.

00:28.414 --> 00:30.180
Seriously, House of Flying Daggers is

00:30.182 --> 00:32.049
my favorite Chinese movie.

00:32.051 --> 00:34.050
- What's your favorite?
- Oh, oh,

00:34.052 --> 00:37.422
the one where Jackie Chan kicks
the crap out of that panda.

00:38.857 --> 00:41.592
Hi!

00:41.594 --> 00:43.760
I brought healthy movie night snacks.

00:43.762 --> 00:45.696
Jícama and tzatziki.

00:45.698 --> 00:49.600
Oh, the original names
of Batman and Robin.

00:49.602 --> 00:51.880
So, Jen, tell me about
this movie you picked.

00:51.882 --> 00:53.105
No, no.

00:53.107 --> 00:55.105
It'll literally take
longer than the movie.

00:55.107 --> 00:57.507
All right, I'll pick you up later.

00:57.509 --> 00:58.932
I got to get to the library.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.256
There's this one really wobbly chair...

01:01.258 --> 01:02.962
and I want to get it.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.870
Uh, so, my college
boy has his first test

01:06.872 --> 01:08.852
coming up in Philosophy.

01:08.854 --> 01:10.686
A Philosophy test?

01:10.688 --> 01:13.392
"Oh, the humanity!"

01:15.760 --> 01:17.761
Philosophy is one of the Humani...

01:17.763 --> 01:21.082
Oh, come on, it's a good joke.

01:21.084 --> 01:22.898
You get to laugh twice.

01:22.900 --> 01:24.467
Once when she says it

01:24.469 --> 01:27.206
and once when she explains it.

01:29.207 --> 01:31.642
First big test. Are you ready for this?

01:31.644 --> 01:33.139
- Well, I...
- He's ready for anything.

01:33.141 --> 01:34.377
He's gonna crush it.

01:34.379 --> 01:36.946
- Guys, tell him he's gonna crush it.
- You're going to crush it.

01:36.948 --> 01:38.627
Much like Xiao Mei in
House of Flying Daggers.

01:38.629 --> 01:39.883
Right, right. Right.

01:39.885 --> 01:41.742
This is where I came in,
this is where I take off.

01:41.744 --> 01:43.916
I s... I sold the '68 Camaro,

01:43.918 --> 01:46.240
I'm gonna take her out for one
last ride before I let her go.

01:46.242 --> 01:49.225
Aw. Oh, I guess the hardest part
of this car-flipping business

01:49.227 --> 01:51.061
is saying goodbye.

01:51.063 --> 01:52.829
She is a '68 Camaro,

01:52.831 --> 01:55.164
- I'm a human man.
- Mm.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.933
We both knew what this was.

01:57.935 --> 01:59.609
All right, I got to
get out of here, too.

01:59.611 --> 02:00.833
And go review my notes.

02:00.835 --> 02:03.339
Everyone is so smart at college.

02:03.341 --> 02:05.776
Even at night.

02:05.778 --> 02:07.777
You got this, babe.
You're gonna crush it.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.112
Oh, you know, I am so proud of Kyle.

02:10.114 --> 02:11.270
I think he's gonna do great.

02:11.272 --> 02:14.263
You're living in a dream world, lady.

02:16.292 --> 02:19.292
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

02:21.050 --> 02:22.539
What are you worried about?

02:22.541 --> 02:24.160
Kyle's got a light
schedule this semester.

02:24.162 --> 02:26.362
- I'm sure he'll do fine.
- Based on what?

02:26.364 --> 02:28.799
I mean, let's face it, he was
never the greatest student.

02:28.801 --> 02:31.200
- And it's even harder when you're older than everyone.
- Mm.

02:31.202 --> 02:33.302
Try being younger and
smarter than everyone.

02:33.304 --> 02:35.507
That's no picnic, either.

02:37.208 --> 02:40.110
Uh, hey, Mom, you are a tutor.

02:40.112 --> 02:42.611
I would like to hire
you to work with Kyle.

02:42.613 --> 02:43.802
But without paying you

02:43.804 --> 02:46.129
or letting him know what you're doing.

02:46.131 --> 02:49.618
Uh... Well, I-I, uh,
I'd be happy to help,

02:49.620 --> 02:51.555
but, uh, why can't Kyle know?

02:51.557 --> 02:53.557
Yeah, and why don't you have any money?

02:53.559 --> 02:55.158
This woman's time is worth something.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.694
Okay, if you could just...

02:57.696 --> 02:59.628
Uh, Kyle's confidence is shaky.

02:59.630 --> 03:01.797
And if-if he thinks that
people are doubting him,

03:01.799 --> 03:02.996
he'll start doubting himself,

03:02.998 --> 03:04.367
- and then he's screwed.
- Mm.

03:04.369 --> 03:06.902
Well, whatever I can
do to help. I'm all in.

03:06.904 --> 03:09.023
Uh, what exactly does Kyle need?

03:09.025 --> 03:11.474
Um, you know, study
habits, uh, note-taking,

03:11.476 --> 03:12.876
- test taking strategies.
- Okay.

03:12.878 --> 03:14.544
All the stuff you thought
I'd need, and then...

03:14.546 --> 03:17.546
... this happened.

03:17.548 --> 03:19.387
Okay. All right, well, honey, uh,

03:19.389 --> 03:20.503
bring him by tomorrow.

03:20.505 --> 03:23.353
I have got a lot of
surefire learning strategies.

03:23.355 --> 03:26.255
I'll help, too. I have lots
of free time after school

03:26.257 --> 03:29.494
because the homework in
this country is a joke.

03:30.388 --> 03:32.319
You know, it might be more of a picnic

03:32.321 --> 03:34.324
if you'd lose the attitude.

03:39.661 --> 03:42.637
- '51 Mercury Wagon.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.207
- Man, isn't she a beauty?
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:45.209 --> 03:48.778
- Mm.
- Could be "he's a beauty".

03:48.780 --> 03:52.349
Remember, Chuck, this
is 2020, all right?

03:52.351 --> 03:54.617
You know, that-that could be very nice

03:54.619 --> 03:55.850
once we flip it, huh?

03:55.852 --> 03:56.920
- Mm.
- Yeah?

03:56.922 --> 03:58.916
- Tough call.
- Mm-hmm.

03:58.918 --> 04:00.791
Maybe we should let
Mike weigh in on this.

04:00.793 --> 04:02.154
- Huh?
- Oh... Oh, there he is.

04:02.156 --> 04:03.849
- Good morning, guys.
- Morning, Mike.

04:03.851 --> 04:06.874
Mike, you remember that old
lady from Pagosa Springs,

04:06.876 --> 04:09.036
- right, with the '51 Woody?
- Oh, yeah.

04:09.038 --> 04:10.561
- Right, huh? Yeah.
- Beautiful car, man.

04:10.563 --> 04:12.578
Wood on the outside,
wood slats interior.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.371
That's so much wood,
it's like driving around

04:14.373 --> 04:17.964
in Dean Martin's den.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.524
- Do we make her an offer?
- Well, I-I'm not sure. It's...

04:20.526 --> 04:21.945
- T-There's a lot to weigh...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

04:21.947 --> 04:23.228
we don't have a buyer yet,

04:23.230 --> 04:25.790
- and it's going to take a hell of a lot of work...
- Right.

04:30.988 --> 04:33.756
Yes!

04:33.758 --> 04:36.960
- All right, looks like we're buying a Mercury.
- Yeah.

04:36.962 --> 04:39.328
- I thought you weren't sure.
- That's past tense, Mike.

04:39.330 --> 04:41.664
- Now I'm sure.
- Hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

04:41.666 --> 04:43.265
Somebody please tell me what's going on.

04:43.267 --> 04:45.734
Preferably somebody
that's not all liquored up.

04:45.736 --> 04:48.404
Ed doesn't make any tough car decisions

04:48.406 --> 04:52.008
until you throw your briefcase
and we see how it lands.

04:52.010 --> 04:53.642
Wow, that makes sense.

04:53.644 --> 04:55.479
- It's silly and stupid.
- Yes.

04:55.481 --> 04:57.279
It's worked for months, Mike.

04:57.281 --> 04:59.849
You toss the briefcase,
if it lands upright...

04:59.851 --> 05:01.585
- it's a green light. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

05:01.587 --> 05:04.421
And if it falls over
or, God forbid, hits Ed,

05:04.423 --> 05:07.143
- like that one time...
- Yeah, yeah...

05:07.145 --> 05:08.168
That's the red light.

05:08.170 --> 05:09.992
"Do not proceed. No".

05:09.994 --> 05:11.457
So, wait a minute.

05:11.459 --> 05:13.964
You're telling me that that
GTO that we bought and flipped

05:13.966 --> 05:16.856
for a lot of money, we bought
because I landed the briefcase?

05:16.858 --> 05:17.933
Yes.

05:17.935 --> 05:20.669
And the only time we
defied the briefcase

05:20.671 --> 05:22.987
was when we bought that '62 Imperial.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.244
Which turned out to be stolen.

05:24.246 --> 05:27.777
And I burned my mouth
on the soup that day.

05:27.779 --> 05:30.113
Well, you know, it's
good to know that we...

05:30.115 --> 05:32.948
we don't base our little car
business on sound practices

05:32.950 --> 05:35.217
like legwork and research.

05:35.219 --> 05:38.455
Mikey, we do all that. But we're humans.

05:38.457 --> 05:42.228
We make mistakes. The
leather never lies.

05:46.498 --> 05:48.832
Okay, Kyle's here.

05:48.834 --> 05:52.471
I know it's wrong, but I
just love fooling people.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.005
Hi, hi, uh, we just stopped by

05:56.007 --> 05:57.630
to pick up some of my old fabric.

05:57.632 --> 06:01.044
Uh, what cool, cool
thing are you kids up to?

06:01.046 --> 06:03.546
Oh, Vanessa and I were just discussing

06:03.548 --> 06:05.582
the best study techniques.

06:05.584 --> 06:08.484
Uh, yes, my tutoring company
is always looking to update

06:08.486 --> 06:10.160
its methods for the students.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.388
Fun! So fun.

06:11.390 --> 06:13.856
Right, Kyle?

06:13.858 --> 06:15.258
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.829
It's not, like,
spitting-off-a-bridge fun but...

06:19.330 --> 06:21.431
Well, hey, why don't you
stay up here with them

06:21.433 --> 06:23.065
and I'll grab the fabric
from the basement?

06:23.067 --> 06:24.534
Ooh, wait, but I thought
you brought me here

06:24.536 --> 06:26.782
- to help you carry it up.
- Oh. No need.

06:26.784 --> 06:28.939
I've got Thelma and Louise.

06:30.888 --> 06:34.186
Well, let me know if you need
any help from Lefty and Righty.

06:36.113 --> 06:38.347
Kyle, uh, why don't-don't you join us?

06:38.349 --> 06:40.784
- Here, come on, come.
- Yeah, you're going to be taking tests now.

06:40.786 --> 06:42.919
You would probably find
this super interesting.

06:42.921 --> 06:44.520
Uh, yeah, okay.

06:44.522 --> 06:47.222
Uh, okay, so, uh, I was
just saying to Jen that

06:47.224 --> 06:50.727
the key to studying is a
solid note-taking system.

06:50.729 --> 06:52.561
Like, uh, like with Roman numerals.

06:52.563 --> 06:54.698
Kyle, do you ever use Roman numerals?

06:54.700 --> 06:57.770
Oh, I try to stick to
American-made numerals.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.519
Okay. Uh, well, there is, uh,

07:02.521 --> 07:06.345
there's also the Mapping Method,
uh, which is much more visual.

07:06.347 --> 07:08.436
Oh, you know what? You
guys should try what I do.

07:08.438 --> 07:11.226
I make important notes in black pen

07:11.228 --> 07:15.158
and super important notes in blue pen.

07:17.255 --> 07:20.556
Aren't those colors kind of similar?

07:20.558 --> 07:22.092
Yes, and that's why

07:22.094 --> 07:24.897
I trace over my blue notes in red.

07:26.397 --> 07:27.964
Okay, okay, well, um,

07:27.966 --> 07:30.065
however you get your notes,

07:30.067 --> 07:32.102
you still have to retain
the information, so...

07:32.104 --> 07:35.005
Oh, I have a great trick for that.

07:35.007 --> 07:39.008
Memorize every word
forward and backward.

07:39.010 --> 07:40.609
When I was learning English,

07:40.611 --> 07:42.748
I did that with "The
Star-Spangled Banner".

07:44.750 --> 07:46.650
♪ Brave the of ♪

07:46.652 --> 07:50.623
♪ Home the and free... ♪

07:52.824 --> 07:55.659
♪ The of land ♪

07:55.661 --> 07:59.496
♪ The o'er. ♪

07:59.498 --> 08:00.666
Wow!

08:05.655 --> 08:08.345
- Oh, look at this meeting of the minds.
- Yeah...

08:08.347 --> 08:10.570
I smell brain cells burning.

08:10.572 --> 08:14.064
Maybe that's why my
head's starting to hurt.

08:14.066 --> 08:15.322
Wait, it is?

08:15.324 --> 08:17.045
No, no. No, we...

08:17.047 --> 08:19.972
we were just having a fun
conversation about learning.

08:19.974 --> 08:22.063
They were just telling
me my system doesn't work.

08:22.065 --> 08:24.590
Why would they do that? That
would hurt his confidence.

08:24.592 --> 08:26.914
Mom, Jen, tell him his system works.

08:26.916 --> 08:28.574
Uh, yeah, of course it does.

08:28.576 --> 08:32.462
We-we were just discussing
alternate learning methods.

08:32.464 --> 08:34.029
For fun. Y... 'Cause...

08:34.030 --> 08:36.835
... it's fun.

08:39.371 --> 08:42.642
Yeah. That's not fun.

08:43.662 --> 08:46.320
And it's too late for me
to change my methods now.

08:46.322 --> 08:48.711
I only have two more
lectures before the test,

08:48.713 --> 08:50.646
and I've already bought the pens. So...

08:50.648 --> 08:53.982
Yeah, he doesn't need any
alternate study methods.

08:53.984 --> 08:56.653
- He doesn't?
- No, he doesn't. He's doing fine.

08:56.655 --> 08:58.620
He's totally crushing it,
and he doesn't need your help.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.891
Get a life, nerds! Come on, Kyle.

09:07.031 --> 09:09.332
I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:09.334 --> 09:10.667
- Oh.
- A little peace offering for

09:10.669 --> 09:12.202
throwing you under the bus earlier.

09:12.204 --> 09:13.770
I can't drink.

09:13.772 --> 09:15.838
Well, you can drink, Jen.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.676
But you shouldn't.

09:18.844 --> 09:21.044
Uh...

09:21.046 --> 09:24.246
I'm not one to turn my
nose up at wine... Mm-hmm.

09:24.248 --> 09:25.615
What the hell was that?

09:25.617 --> 09:27.583
Kyle was rattled and
I had to pull the plug

09:27.585 --> 09:29.184
before he lost all his confidence.

09:29.186 --> 09:31.053
Well, we didn't mean to scare him.

09:31.055 --> 09:33.289
We were just offering
suggestions and then he took it

09:33.291 --> 09:37.092
- as criticism.
- Ugh. Men can be so sensitive.

09:37.094 --> 09:39.228
It's like they think taking any help

09:39.230 --> 09:41.297
is a sign of weakness.

09:41.299 --> 09:43.098
Well, especially from a woman.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.701
Look, they need to be the heroes.

09:44.703 --> 09:47.303
Come home from the hunt
and throw down the carcass.

09:47.305 --> 09:49.706
And look, hey, that is not a metaphor.

09:49.708 --> 09:51.707
Those scratches on my table?

09:51.709 --> 09:54.144
Antlers.

09:54.146 --> 09:56.578
Tell me about it. I scared
off so many boyfriends

09:56.580 --> 09:58.981
by saying these six simple words:

09:58.983 --> 10:00.917
- "I can reach that for you".
- Oh...

10:00.919 --> 10:02.385
So what do we do now?

10:02.387 --> 10:04.920
- How are we going to help Kyle?
- I don't know.

10:04.922 --> 10:07.823
We need to find a guy who thinks like us

10:07.825 --> 10:09.992
but who can tell Kyle
that accepting help

10:09.994 --> 10:11.827
doesn't make you less of a man.

10:11.829 --> 10:15.006
But where are we going to find
a man who thinks like that?

10:15.008 --> 10:18.432
♪ Howdy-hooooo. ♪

10:22.740 --> 10:24.240
Hello, ladies.

10:24.242 --> 10:26.976
I'm just returning the
DVD that I borrowed.

10:26.978 --> 10:29.482
- Oh, what is it?
- The Notebook.

10:30.916 --> 10:33.152
Gosling gets me every time.

10:35.353 --> 10:37.356
He's perfect.

10:40.658 --> 10:42.725
The old lady turned down
our offer on the Woody.

10:42.727 --> 10:44.312
- Oh.
- Her husband must've told her

10:44.314 --> 10:45.861
what it was worth before he died.

10:45.863 --> 10:47.764
Yeah, the bastard.

10:47.766 --> 10:49.832
Um, I mean, God rest his soul.

10:49.834 --> 10:52.602
Right. So we gonna make
another offer on it?

10:52.604 --> 10:56.105
Well, we might. We might not.

10:56.107 --> 10:58.842
We're waiting for... you know.

10:58.844 --> 11:00.512
The magic briefcase.

11:01.847 --> 11:04.613
Listen, uh, just do it,
uh, do it from about here

11:04.615 --> 11:06.381
'cause you need to have a nice arc.

11:06.383 --> 11:08.016
Need an arc, that's not bad.

11:08.018 --> 11:09.458
Come on.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.730
- Come on.
- Gotcha. All right.

11:11.732 --> 11:14.233
All right, here we go,
here we go, all right.

11:14.235 --> 11:15.501
Ah, refresh me.

11:15.503 --> 11:17.536
Yes?

11:17.538 --> 11:19.738
If it lands upright, we buy the car?

11:19.740 --> 11:22.736
Yes, Baxter, now come on, focus.
We-we-we really want this car.

11:22.738 --> 11:23.761
- Yes.
- Right.

11:23.763 --> 11:25.011
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Come on, come on.

11:25.013 --> 11:26.075
Here we go.

11:26.077 --> 11:29.234
Ah, big decision. Is
this briefcase worthy?

11:29.236 --> 11:30.659
You know, when you say it like that,

11:30.661 --> 11:32.951
you make it sound stupid,
so just toss the satchel.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.021
Just want to make sure
we're all on the same page.

11:35.023 --> 11:38.056
- Just be the briefcase, Baxter.
- Do this. You can do this.

11:38.058 --> 11:40.425
Okay, here we go, guys.

11:41.663 --> 11:43.419
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:43.421 --> 11:45.428
Now what are the rules?
Let me do it one more time.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.766
No, no. It's all about the first toss.

11:46.768 --> 11:48.233
It's a mulligan, it's a mulligan.

11:48.235 --> 11:50.904
Let it go, Baxter. The briefcase
knows more than we do,

11:50.906 --> 11:52.104
even when it hurts.

11:52.106 --> 11:53.872
I don't know what happened.
Maybe first time ever

11:53.874 --> 11:56.108
the pressure got to me. You
know, I really wanted that car.

11:56.110 --> 11:58.777
Come on, Chuck. We've... we
have our answer. You know?

11:58.779 --> 12:01.783
And I'm-I'm-I'm dumping out
that soup I brought for lunch.

12:03.451 --> 12:05.086
Ah, maybe next time, guys.

12:11.292 --> 12:14.093
And right here.

12:14.095 --> 12:15.728
Whoo!

12:17.731 --> 12:19.431
Thanks for the hand, buddy.

12:19.433 --> 12:23.035
Uh, that box is awfully
light. Are you okay?

12:23.037 --> 12:25.704
You think that I'm weak
because I'm asking you for help?

12:25.706 --> 12:27.940
With a box that weighs three pounds.

12:27.942 --> 12:31.109
A man can be strong
and still ask for help.

12:31.111 --> 12:32.914
Not with a box that weighs three pounds.

12:35.249 --> 12:37.449
Wait... there's nothing
in here but bubble wrap.

12:37.451 --> 12:40.509
It's not about the box,
okay? I can lift the box.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.000
I'm a very masculine guy.

12:42.002 --> 12:43.723
Well, sure, you have a beard.

12:43.725 --> 12:47.260
Too many men are stuck in
this primitive mindset, right?

12:47.262 --> 12:49.494
The male must go it alone.

12:49.496 --> 12:51.964
You see it in apes, you
see it in cockroaches.

12:51.966 --> 12:53.766
Don't bad-mouth the cockroach.

12:53.768 --> 12:57.002
Sometimes, when I was little,
they would lead me to the food.

12:57.004 --> 12:59.104
We can rise above our worst instincts.

12:59.106 --> 13:01.741
You can rise above. Just let people in.

13:01.743 --> 13:04.911
It is so simple. Say, "I need help".

13:04.913 --> 13:07.617
But I don't.

13:07.619 --> 13:09.482
Really? You don't need
help with anything?

13:09.484 --> 13:12.318
Like, even something... school?

13:12.320 --> 13:14.520
School? Wait, what's going on here?

13:14.522 --> 13:18.491
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hello, Mandy.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.693
Hey, babe. You helping Ryan?

13:20.695 --> 13:24.196
And, Ryan, are you accepting
help like a real man?

13:24.198 --> 13:26.398
Uh, yeah, Mandy, despite
our stellar acting,

13:26.400 --> 13:27.533
I think he's onto us.

13:27.535 --> 13:28.935
You told Ryan I needed help,

13:28.937 --> 13:31.137
just like you told Mrs.
B and Jen I needed help.

13:31.139 --> 13:33.104
Wh-Where is he getting this?

13:33.106 --> 13:34.973
Has he been sampling the wares?

13:34.975 --> 13:37.142
Hey, save it. You don't think
that I can do this, do you?

13:37.144 --> 13:38.344
No, of course she does.

13:38.346 --> 13:39.845
Ryan, you had your
chance and you blew it.

13:39.847 --> 13:42.381
Okay, well, I would
leave, but I work here,

13:42.383 --> 13:44.449
so I guess I'll just go to the other end

13:44.451 --> 13:46.088
of this very tiny store.

13:48.056 --> 13:51.213
Hey, of course I believe in
you. I'm the one who's been

13:51.215 --> 13:53.285
telling you that you're
crushing it, and you are.

13:53.287 --> 13:54.459
Keep crushing it.

13:54.461 --> 13:56.896
I thought we had a
relationship built on honesty.

13:56.898 --> 13:59.323
You know, but maybe sometime
you can ask Thelma and Louise

13:59.325 --> 14:00.594
to help you lift the truth.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.679
Hey, Dad.

14:13.681 --> 14:14.879
Hey, honey.

14:14.881 --> 14:17.009
Listen, I got a big inventory snafu.

14:17.011 --> 14:18.150
Can I help you with something?

14:18.152 --> 14:19.584
Well, it's no big deal.
I just stopped by

14:19.586 --> 14:20.946
to tell you I wrecked my marriage.

14:22.657 --> 14:24.059
That one with Kyle, huh?

14:26.027 --> 14:28.594
Wh-What-What's going on here?

14:28.596 --> 14:31.597
Um, I broke one of my wedding vows, Dad.

14:31.599 --> 14:33.940
S-Some of those vows
are bigger than others.

14:33.942 --> 14:35.401
What-what vow are we talking about?

14:35.403 --> 14:38.324
The one that says that you
can't doubt that your spouse

14:38.326 --> 14:40.492
will do well in college, even
though the last class he took

14:40.494 --> 14:41.840
was tenth grade wood shop

14:41.842 --> 14:44.709
and the napkin holder he
made won't hold napkins.

14:44.711 --> 14:48.414
Oh, yeah, th-that vow.

14:48.416 --> 14:51.119
Yeah, that cost Mickey
Rooney four marriages.

14:54.054 --> 14:56.888
You have doubts about Kyle in college?

14:56.890 --> 14:58.358
No, no, I don't have doubts.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.526
I just don't know if he can do it.

15:00.528 --> 15:02.060
Well, just for the sake of conversation,

15:02.062 --> 15:04.637
let's call those "doubts".

15:04.639 --> 15:07.161
H-H-Have you talked
about this with Kyle?

15:07.163 --> 15:08.935
No. No, he's my husband.

15:08.937 --> 15:11.070
What kind of a wife would
I be if I told him that?

15:11.072 --> 15:12.908
Well, m-maybe be an honest wife.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.310
The hard part about vows
are for better, worse;

15:17.312 --> 15:19.150
richer, poorer; in
sickness and in health.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.242
But that's not what this is.

15:20.244 --> 15:23.581
Although, I do have a
little bit of a throat thing.

15:23.583 --> 15:26.285
What all of that means is
that you got to be there

15:26.287 --> 15:28.887
for the other person in tough times

15:28.889 --> 15:31.824
and not just pretend
that they don't exist.

15:31.826 --> 15:35.661
Okay, wait, so you're saying
that I should tell Kyle

15:35.663 --> 15:37.997
that I have doubts about
this whole college thing?

15:37.999 --> 15:39.931
That would be really hard for me to do.

15:39.933 --> 15:41.901
- No, it wouldn't.
- Yes, it would.

15:41.903 --> 15:43.935
No, you can crush it. You got this.

15:43.937 --> 15:46.671
Not helping, Dad.

15:46.673 --> 15:49.308
Oh, whoa, whoa. What am I thinking?

15:49.310 --> 15:51.580
So it-it's annoying to
be told things are fine

15:51.582 --> 15:53.912
even though you're
not sure that they are?

15:53.914 --> 15:55.583
Yes.

15:57.745 --> 16:00.982
When am I gonna learn to
stop walking into this?

16:05.125 --> 16:07.926
- Hey, guys, I'm taking off.
- Hey, hey.

16:07.928 --> 16:09.328
Or you can come join us.

16:09.330 --> 16:10.863
- We're celebrating.
- Hey.

16:10.865 --> 16:12.364
Oh? What are we celebrating?

16:12.366 --> 16:14.702
Lola Falana coming to the Paramount?

16:16.303 --> 16:18.436
Maybe celebrating's too big a word.

16:18.438 --> 16:20.006
We're relieved.

16:20.008 --> 16:22.344
Some other guy bought that car.

16:22.346 --> 16:24.883
Yeah, or lady, Chuck. It's 2020.

16:26.279 --> 16:28.113
Whoever it is, I hope
they're good at digging

16:28.115 --> 16:29.614
through salvage yards because,

16:29.616 --> 16:31.862
according to the all-knowing briefcase,

16:31.864 --> 16:33.285
that thing's got a lot of problems.

16:33.287 --> 16:36.236
Yeah. Actually, the
engine's in perfect shape,

16:36.238 --> 16:37.622
so's all the wood paneling.

16:39.226 --> 16:41.794
Uh, what? How do you know that?

16:43.331 --> 16:45.533
You bought it.

16:46.567 --> 16:49.467
You went against the briefcase?

16:49.469 --> 16:51.767
Yeah, it was on its
side. You've cursed us.

16:51.769 --> 16:52.839
Yeah.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.906
I did that on purpose. Come on.

16:54.908 --> 16:56.874
Ed, you're the smartest
businessman I know,

16:56.876 --> 16:58.311
and, Chuck, you work near him.

16:59.610 --> 17:02.400
We don't need superstitious
voodoo to buy a car.

17:02.402 --> 17:05.661
Yeah, I know that, I know
that, but it's a lot of fun.

17:05.663 --> 17:08.396
And if things went wrong, we
didn't feel so bad about it.

17:08.397 --> 17:10.320
It gave us plausible deniability.

17:10.323 --> 17:12.323
Plausible? A flying briefcase?

17:12.325 --> 17:14.726
When you say it like that,
you make it sound stupid.

17:14.728 --> 17:16.762
- Mm-hmm. Hey.
- Hmm?

17:16.763 --> 17:18.496
Hey, look, Joe found us something.

17:18.498 --> 17:21.387
It's a '68 Charger. It
looks a little rough.

17:21.390 --> 17:22.835
Ooh, that's a nice car.

17:22.837 --> 17:24.403
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Look, it's got a HEMI in it.

17:24.405 --> 17:26.105
- Oh...
- People are looking for that car.

17:26.107 --> 17:28.941
But you just bought
us that Woody, and, uh,

17:28.943 --> 17:30.743
that's gonna take a lot of work.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.912
Yeah. What to do, huh?

17:32.914 --> 17:34.916
Tough call.

17:37.803 --> 17:39.426
All right, one more.

17:39.428 --> 17:41.604
- Okay. All right, here we go, here we go.
- Okay, come on.

17:41.606 --> 17:42.704
- Ed.
- Yeah?

17:42.706 --> 17:44.004
You got to move your Ermine.

17:44.006 --> 17:46.231
That's, uh, Ethel Ermine, please.

17:48.629 --> 17:50.681
All right, here we go. Oh, baby.

17:50.683 --> 17:51.896
- Come on, go. Here we go.
- You guys ready?

17:51.898 --> 17:53.131
- Yeah, itty-bitty toss, man.
- All right.

17:53.133 --> 17:55.100
- You can do it.
- Here we go.

17:55.102 --> 17:56.368
Yes! Yeah!

17:56.370 --> 17:58.070
Green light, people.

17:58.072 --> 18:00.360
- Oh. Geez.
- You all right? You okay, man?

18:00.362 --> 18:01.364
Sorry about that.

18:03.477 --> 18:06.579
Hey. Do you have time? We need to talk.

18:06.581 --> 18:08.079
Time?

18:08.081 --> 18:09.415
Well, Plato said,

18:09.417 --> 18:12.618
"Time is a moving image of reality".

18:12.620 --> 18:15.223
Pretty sure "time is money".

18:17.225 --> 18:20.158
Um, look, I didn't mean
to upset you earlier.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.660
Really? So I'm just supposed
to feel wonderful with you

18:22.662 --> 18:25.664
constantly telling me how
great and smart you think I am?

18:25.666 --> 18:28.067
I would.

18:28.069 --> 18:31.637
Well, Plato said, "I know
too well that these arguments

18:31.639 --> 18:34.572
from probabilities are imposters".

18:34.574 --> 18:37.743
I have no idea what that means.

18:37.745 --> 18:40.282
Neither do I.

18:41.983 --> 18:44.649
But you think I do because
you think I'm a genius.

18:44.651 --> 18:46.851
I don't. I don't think you're a genius.

18:46.853 --> 18:48.154
What?

18:48.156 --> 18:50.089
Well, I have doubts.

18:50.091 --> 18:51.937
I mean, yes, you always
finish the puzzle before me

18:51.939 --> 18:53.187
on Wheel of Fortune,
but that doesn't mean

18:53.189 --> 18:55.327
you know how to take college tests.

18:55.329 --> 18:58.097
I guess it doesn't.

18:58.099 --> 19:00.299
Yeah, and it's been, like, ten years

19:00.301 --> 19:02.434
since you've taken one.
What if things have changed?

19:02.436 --> 19:05.637
Oh, God, I hadn't thought of that.

19:05.639 --> 19:08.439
And-and I'm sorry, babe,
but going back to school

19:08.441 --> 19:11.145
is a huge deal and you weren't
that good the first time.

19:14.782 --> 19:17.136
Say something!

19:17.138 --> 19:19.308
Thank you.

19:21.121 --> 19:22.288
What?

19:22.290 --> 19:23.989
Well, the pressure was killing me.

19:23.991 --> 19:25.890
I mean, everyone was so
sure I was gonna do great.

19:25.892 --> 19:27.693
Have they met me?

19:27.695 --> 19:30.296
They were lying.

19:30.298 --> 19:32.081
Everyone has doubts about you.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.666
Yes!

19:33.668 --> 19:35.962
Wait, okay, so you don't
mind that we feel that way?

19:35.964 --> 19:37.321
No. Everyone should have doubts.

19:37.323 --> 19:38.837
This is gonna be really hard for me.

19:38.839 --> 19:40.673
I know, sweetie, but
just because I have doubts

19:40.675 --> 19:43.809
doesn't mean that I don't
believe in you. I do.

19:43.811 --> 19:46.861
This is so great because
now it's not all on me.

19:46.863 --> 19:48.580
I have someone I can talk to about this.

19:48.582 --> 19:50.482
Always.

19:50.484 --> 19:53.152
And from now on, I promise
to be honest with you,

19:53.154 --> 19:55.887
even if I think it might
hurt your feelings.

19:55.889 --> 19:57.322
And I'll do the same for you.

19:57.324 --> 19:59.191
Oh, sweetie...

19:59.193 --> 20:00.595
no.

20:08.668 --> 20:10.593
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man

20:10.595 --> 20:14.005
with the five least helpful
words in the English language:

20:14.007 --> 20:16.244
"You got this, no problem".

20:18.079 --> 20:19.544
Translation:

20:19.546 --> 20:22.915
"Please don't ask me
to do this for you".

20:22.917 --> 20:25.117
We all like to pretend
"You got this" means,

20:25.119 --> 20:26.784
"I believe in you", but let's face it,

20:26.786 --> 20:29.355
it just really means,
"It would be so great

20:29.357 --> 20:31.857
if you could just take care of
your own side of the street".

20:31.859 --> 20:33.896
I mean, sometimes you mean it,

20:33.898 --> 20:36.427
like the first time you let go
of the back of the two-wheeler

20:36.429 --> 20:39.130
and watch our kid wobble away.
"Y-You got this. You got this.

20:39.132 --> 20:42.368
Oh, oh, oh! Go, whoa, whoa. Good try.

20:42.370 --> 20:45.236
Try not to lead with
your head next time.

20:45.238 --> 20:47.473
I'll get a Band-Aid".

20:47.475 --> 20:50.908
Of course, more and more these
days, people don't get it.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.977
You don't believe me, ask a young person

20:52.979 --> 20:55.047
to grab the jack and change a tire.

20:55.049 --> 20:56.410
The kid's gonna look at you and go,

20:56.412 --> 20:59.217
"Wh-Who's Jack?"

20:59.219 --> 21:00.886
We spend a lot of energy

21:00.888 --> 21:02.987
teaching people how to ask for help,

21:02.989 --> 21:06.157
but if we teach people to
engage, fail, and learn,

21:06.159 --> 21:07.826
then we'll have people
who don't need help.

21:07.828 --> 21:09.595
Not from me, not from the government,

21:09.597 --> 21:11.230
and certainly not from some smart device

21:11.232 --> 21:13.235
that you bought to bug your own home.

21:16.137 --> 21:19.237
Listen, in the Bible, my
favorite carpenter says,

21:19.239 --> 21:23.075
"If you ask me anything
in my name, I will do it",

21:23.077 --> 21:25.444
but I wonder that under
his breath he actually said,

21:25.446 --> 21:27.354
"But I would prefer if you took a shot

21:27.356 --> 21:30.114
at figuring it out yourself.

21:30.116 --> 21:33.118
Come on, you got this, no problem".

21:35.656 --> 21:37.158
Baxter out.
