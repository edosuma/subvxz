00:35.957 --> 00:37.217
Hello, Trish.

00:38.145 --> 00:39.450
I'm John.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.800
Mind if I have a look at your aura?

00:49.500 --> 00:50.780
Tainted.

00:51.380 --> 00:52.750
By what?

00:53.580 --> 00:55.380
Let's have a look inside.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.790
Jeez! Bloody hell.

01:18.542 --> 01:21.505
Chas, Renee, I'm gonna need
a little more than five minutes.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.005
Why? What are you up to, John?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.791
I'm calling in a specialist.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.150
John! John!

01:28.500 --> 01:29.605
John!

02:06.835 --> 02:08.625
Your timing sucks, Johnny.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.345
I was right in the middle of a threesome
with a dryad and a sylph.

02:12.478 --> 02:14.675
Both of whom, I might add,
are better in the sack

02:14.710 --> 02:16.002
than you ever were.

02:16.038 --> 02:19.213
Hey, you were nothing to write
home to my mum about either, love.

02:19.290 --> 02:22.255
We both know that's not true.

02:22.390 --> 02:24.910
Now, what do you want
from the Nightmare Nurse?

02:28.420 --> 02:31.925
Well, I did swear an oath
to preserve life, do no harm,

02:31.960 --> 02:33.480
and all that other crap.

02:38.580 --> 02:39.925
So what do you think?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.385
I think you should shut up
and let me do my job.

02:42.420 --> 02:43.755
It's possession, right?

02:43.790 --> 02:46.064
What part of "shut up"
don't you understand?

02:49.920 --> 02:53.425
It's not possession, because
there's nothing here to possess.

02:53.460 --> 02:54.465
What?

02:54.500 --> 02:58.480
Her physical form is here,
but her essence? Her soul?

02:59.360 --> 03:00.465
It's gone.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.925
Well, someone was there a minute ago.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.670
Let's find out who.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.345
Help me.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.460
Trish? Trish, where are you?

03:23.496 --> 03:25.755
In a... In a cage.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.796
I think. It's hard to see,

03:28.210 --> 03:29.675
and it's so cold.

03:29.835 --> 03:34.868
- Are you alone?
- All alone, except when he comes.

03:34.904 --> 03:37.024
Who, Trish, who comes?

03:38.210 --> 03:39.620
The nasty man.

03:39.656 --> 03:40.965
Does he have a name?

03:42.081 --> 03:43.880
Trish, does he have a name?

03:49.080 --> 03:52.210
I have many names.

03:52.993 --> 03:55.480
Be careful to choose the right one.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.635
Well, then tell me what the name is.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.465
- Guess.
- This isn't a bloody game.

04:02.751 --> 04:04.295
It is to me.

04:04.330 --> 04:06.425
What do you want with the girl?

04:06.460 --> 04:13.002
Ooh, so many questions buzzing
in your little gnat brain.

04:13.053 --> 04:17.207
But if you want answers,
John Constantine,

04:17.711 --> 04:20.826
you'll have to come by for a visit.

04:21.170 --> 04:23.680
Come by? Come by where?

04:29.685 --> 04:32.695
John! John, open the damn door!

04:34.289 --> 04:37.254
Asa, are you okay?

04:40.250 --> 04:42.620
Give me a second to put my dress on.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.430
Son of a bitch! If I was
human, I'd be toast now.

05:02.540 --> 05:05.040
I'll get the paperwork
in as soon as I can.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.860
What the hell, John? Who's she?

05:13.896 --> 05:17.175
A private nurse I've hired to
watch over Trish while I'm away.

05:17.210 --> 05:18.320
Away?

05:18.540 --> 05:19.880
But where are you going?

05:20.260 --> 05:22.140
Los Angeles, apparently.
