01:02.363 --> 01:05.364
Thanks, Ryder.
Can I break another?

01:05.366 --> 01:05.898
(Laughing)

01:05.900 --> 01:08.400
Maybe you should work on
some other pup-fu skills

01:08.402 --> 01:11.336
before we run out of boards.

01:11.338 --> 01:12.504
The pups have been
working very hard.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.973
They're ready to test
for they yellow belts.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.875
That's fantastic,
Farmer Yumi.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.444
I'm most impressed with
Marshall.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.613
He's learning to move
as quietly as a mouse.

01:21.615 --> 01:22.414
Cool!

01:22.416 --> 01:25.050
Did you hear that,
Marshall?

01:25.052 --> 01:26.985
Marshall?

01:29.323 --> 01:29.955
Uh-oh.

01:29.957 --> 01:33.792
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:33.794 --> 01:35.360
Looking for me?

01:35.362 --> 01:36.095
Where'd you come from?

01:36.097 --> 01:38.530
I move more quietly
than a mouse.

01:38.532 --> 01:43.535
Everything I do is totally
unexpected.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.537
Huh?

01:45.539 --> 01:47.840
Whoa!

01:47.842 --> 01:48.841
Marshall!

01:48.843 --> 01:49.808
I'm okay!

01:49.810 --> 01:52.644
But I didn't expect that.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.413
(Bleating)

01:54.415 --> 01:57.382
(All laughing)

01:57.384 --> 01:58.550
Laugh while you can.

01:58.552 --> 02:02.387
My Catastrophe Crew
will get their yellow belts

02:02.389 --> 02:05.390
before those pesky pooches.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.865
(Cackling)

02:16.871 --> 02:18.437
You're all ready, pups.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.406
You practiced hard
and know your routines.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.509
Time to earn those
yellow belts.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.543
We can do it!

02:24.545 --> 02:26.011
Yellow belts, here we come!

02:26.013 --> 02:26.945
We got this!

02:26.947 --> 02:28.514
Yes, we can!
Yay!

02:28.516 --> 02:30.449
(Clucking)

02:30.451 --> 02:31.950
Oh, so mighty!

02:31.952 --> 02:33.485
Yet so adorable.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.654
Aren't you, Chickaletta?

02:35.656 --> 02:38.924
Welcome, PAW Patrol.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.493
Welcome, Mayor
and Chickaletta.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.461
(Clucking)

02:42.463 --> 02:45.464
Students, are you ready?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.533
Begin.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.837
Arf, arf!

02:53.007 --> 02:54.640
Ruff!

02:55.376 --> 02:58.443
Yip, yip!

02:58.445 --> 02:59.912
Ha!

03:04.552 --> 03:06.752
Hi-ya!

03:06.754 --> 03:07.519
Ha-da!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.588
Arf-ya!

03:09.590 --> 03:11.590
And now I will--

03:11.592 --> 03:13.592
A-- achoo!

03:13.594 --> 03:14.826
Oh.

03:14.828 --> 03:15.961
Sorry, sensei.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.796
I'm a little allergic to--

03:17.798 --> 03:19.865
(Meowing)
(Sneezing)

03:19.867 --> 03:20.566
Kittens?

03:20.568 --> 03:25.637
My Kit-tastrophe Crew will
now perform their cat-jitsu.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.675
Of course, cat-jitsu is much
better than pup-fu.

03:29.677 --> 03:33.745
Actually, Mayor Humdinger,
pup-fu rules.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.447
Cat-jitsu drools.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.014
What?!

03:36.016 --> 03:38.584
And there's nothing like
Hen-kido.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.886
It's not which art
is superior.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.556
The point is for all pups,
kittens, and mayors

03:44.558 --> 03:45.557
to try to do their best.

03:45.559 --> 03:49.461
Exactly. I try to do my best
more than anyone.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.062
Except me!

03:50.064 --> 03:52.431
I try to do my best
the most.

03:52.433 --> 03:52.998
(Chuckling)

03:53.000 --> 03:56.468
It is time for the kittens to
try their best.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.770
Kittens.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.977
(Meowing)

04:04.979 --> 04:06.678
(Meowing)

04:06.680 --> 04:09.848
Nice, kitties.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.482
(Meowing)

04:10.484 --> 04:14.519
(Meowing)

04:16.690 --> 04:17.556
(Hissing)

04:19.560 --> 04:20.926
Here.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.061
I'll show you
how a pup-fu master

04:23.063 --> 04:24.997
uses the zipline.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.065
Whee!

04:27.067 --> 04:29.701
(Meowing)

04:31.538 --> 04:35.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:35.709 --> 04:37.676
Are you okay, Marshall?

04:37.678 --> 04:38.143
Sure.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.645
A pup-fu master knows exactly
how to land.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.614
When they accidentally fall.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.651
Next we will have the sparring
segment of the belt test.

04:45.653 --> 04:49.821
Chase? Zuma?
Begin.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.560
Ha. Pup play.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.668
Hello.
What's this, then?

05:02.670 --> 05:05.704
A special scroll?

05:05.706 --> 05:08.240
What could be so special?

05:08.242 --> 05:10.809
(Laughing)

05:10.811 --> 05:12.944
Mayor Humdinger?

05:12.946 --> 05:13.378
Oh!

05:13.380 --> 05:14.813
Uh, interesting-looking
scroll.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.550
I was just admiring the, uh,
way it was, uh,

05:18.552 --> 05:19.718
rolled up! Yes.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.553
This ancient scroll
is very precious.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.889
I inherited it from my
grandfather,

05:23.891 --> 05:27.259
and it's been in the family
for hundreds of years.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.127
Wow! That is an old scroll.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.630
YUMI:
Yes. And it contains
the deepest secrets

05:31.632 --> 05:33.632
of the martial arts
masters.

05:33.634 --> 05:38.270
Hmm. It contains all the secrets
of the martial arts?

05:38.272 --> 05:39.037
In the wrong hands,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.672
the scroll could be very
dangerous.

05:40.674 --> 05:45.944
HUMDINGER:
Oh, my. It must be a very
powerful and precious scroll.

05:45.946 --> 05:46.778
(Laughing)

05:46.780 --> 05:49.581
YUMI:
It's time for the final test.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.582
Hi-woof!

05:50.584 --> 05:53.685
Woof-ha!

05:54.621 --> 05:58.724
Whoa!

05:58.726 --> 05:59.157
Hmm.

05:59.159 --> 06:03.562
Pup-fu?
That looks like pup-fail.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.766
Okay, it's time to present
the belts.

06:07.768 --> 06:08.700
It's time, it's time!

06:08.702 --> 06:09.701
I hope we win!
I hope I get it!

06:09.703 --> 06:11.670
YUMI:
Chase.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.639
Rubble.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.341

06:16.343 --> 06:17.843

06:17.845 --> 06:20.345

06:20.347 --> 06:21.813
Congratulations.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.815
(Cheering)

06:23.817 --> 06:24.816
(Whimpering)

06:24.818 --> 06:27.619
And Marshall.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.086
Huh?

06:28.088 --> 06:32.591
Your extra-hard work would
please the ancient masters.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.693
(Barking)

06:34.695 --> 06:37.362
(Cheering)

06:37.364 --> 06:39.164
I'm proud of you pups.

06:39.166 --> 06:39.831
Mayor Humdinger.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.300
Until your kittens learn to
control themselves

06:42.302 --> 06:42.968
and their tools,

06:42.970 --> 06:46.004
I'm afraid they cannot earn
their yellow belts.

06:46.006 --> 06:50.342
Why, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.743
(Meowing)

06:51.745 --> 06:53.845
I'm going to wear
my belt to bed.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.747
I'm going to wear my belt
forever!

06:55.749 --> 06:57.682
(Chuckling)

06:57.684 --> 07:01.286
Okay, pups, good night.

(Phone ringing)

07:40.260 --> 07:41.426
(Yawning)

07:41.428 --> 07:44.930
Hi, Farmer Yumi.
Ryder here.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.965
<i> Ryder, emergency.</i>

07:46.967 --> 07:47.833
<i> The scroll is gone.</i>

07:47.835 --> 07:49.668
What happened?

07:49.670 --> 07:50.302
<i> I don't know.</i>

07:50.304 --> 07:51.736
The hayloft door was open,

07:51.738 --> 07:53.338
but I didn't see
anything else.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.739
Don't worry.
The PAW Patrol will find it.

07:54.741 --> 08:00.712
No job is too big!
No pup is too small!

08:00.714 --> 08:01.680
PAW Patrol...

08:01.682 --> 08:02.747
to the Lookout!

08:02.749 --> 08:06.017
PUPS:
Ryder needs us!

08:06.019 --> 08:07.686
Quiet as a mouse.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.825
Look out!

08:16.463 --> 08:18.763
That's pup--

08:18.765 --> 08:19.865
fu.

08:19.867 --> 08:23.368

08:38.051 --> 08:41.353
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir!

08:41.355 --> 08:44.456
Sorry for waking you
so early, pups,

08:44.458 --> 08:46.858
but I got a call from Farmer
Yumi this morning.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.127
Someone stole her priceless
antique scroll.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.462
<i> Oh, no!</i>

08:50.464 --> 08:52.397
(Gasping)

08:52.399 --> 08:55.333
Chase, I'll need your zipline
and spy drone

08:55.335 --> 08:58.270
to help track down the scroll
and whoever took it.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.739
Spy Chase is on the case!

09:00.741 --> 09:03.775
Marshall, I need you
and your ladder

09:03.777 --> 09:05.443
to check the loft
and rafters for clues.

09:05.445 --> 09:09.381
My highly-trained paws
are at your service!

09:09.383 --> 09:12.817
All right! PAW Patrol

Ladder up!

10:26.827 --> 10:29.894
Is that a toy mouse?

10:29.896 --> 10:32.530
I thought barns had real mice.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.367

than a mouse.

sneeze like that.

Mayor Humdinger was looking at
the scroll yesterday,

11:04.965 --> 11:06.865
but the kittens weren't.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.334
Maybe the kittens
were here later.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.602
They must have come back.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.404
I found a toy mouse
in the hayloft.

11:12.406 --> 11:15.907
We can't let the scroll
fall into the wrong hands.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.374
Or paws.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.411
Yes, which is why
I'm naming you

11:19.413 --> 11:20.879
official guardian
of the scroll.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.580
Whaa?

11:22.582 --> 11:25.016
No student has shown greater
dedication

11:25.018 --> 11:26.418
to learning pup-fu.

11:26.420 --> 11:27.986
I know you'll keep
the scroll safe.

11:27.988 --> 11:32.023
Wow, I've never been the
guardian of anything before.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.925
Thanks, Sensei Yumi.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.460
(Sneezing)

11:35.462 --> 11:39.931
And no student has ever been
as alert as you.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.100
Yeah, that's it.
Alert.

11:42.102 --> 11:46.438
Let's go find Mayor Humdinger
and his kittens.

11:50.610 --> 11:51.976
(Sirens wailing)

11:51.978 --> 11:57.582
Let's see what secrets
this scroll holds.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.351
(Laughing)

12:00.353 --> 12:01.086
(Sirens wailing)

12:01.088 --> 12:03.154
Oh, we'll have to look
at these secrets later.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.357
Act casual, kitties.

12:08.662 --> 12:09.461
(Whistling)

12:09.463 --> 12:13.465
Oh, why, hello, Ryder.
Hello, pups.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.700
What brings you
to my fair city?

12:15.702 --> 12:17.502
Sorry to bother you,
Mayor Humdinger,

12:17.504 --> 12:20.605
but Farmer Yumi's special
scroll disappeared.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.774
What? The scroll is gone?

12:22.776 --> 12:24.476
But it's so valuable.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.479
Farmer Yumi must be very upset.

12:27.481 --> 12:28.213
She is very upset.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.014
Do you know
what happened to it?

12:30.016 --> 12:31.783
I have no idea.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.184
Ryder, what do you think
could have happened?

12:33.186 --> 12:36.588
Maybe one of your cat-jitsu
kittens took it,

12:36.590 --> 12:39.157
not realizing
how important it is.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.560
Hah, my kitties weren't
anywhere near the scroll.

12:42.562 --> 12:46.064
They were too busy practicing
for their cat-jitsu belts.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.165
Right, kitty-witties?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.534
(Meowing)

12:49.536 --> 12:51.636
(Sneezing)

12:51.638 --> 12:54.472
Excuse me. Allergies.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.340
You'll have to keep looking.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.075
Don't waste your time here.

12:57.077 --> 13:02.046
You'll never, ever find that
scroll in Foggy Bottom.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.214
Hmm.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.216
Let's go, pups.

13:05.218 --> 13:09.788
It's a good thing
Foggy Bottom is foggy.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.589
They won't see us hidden here.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.825
Okay, Chase sneezed by the case

13:13.827 --> 13:15.193
where Farmer Yumi kept the
scroll.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.695
A great big kitten sneeze.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.598
And you sneezed again near
Humdinger's kittens.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.434
If it was the kittens,
we should follow them.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.102
They'd see us.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.806
But a drone can secretly
track them.

13:27.808 --> 13:28.506
Chase?

13:28.508 --> 13:31.509
Spy Chase is on the case!

13:31.511 --> 13:32.243
(Barking)

13:32.245 --> 13:34.078
Drone!

13:37.551 --> 13:40.385
Launch!

13:40.387 --> 13:44.756
Follow those kittens!

13:46.459 --> 13:49.427
This is how a mayor walks
his kittens.

13:49.429 --> 13:55.567
After he makes sure
no nosy pups are following.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.505
My drone will follow Humdinger
and his kittens.

14:00.507 --> 14:04.742
If they have the scroll,
we'll find it.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.553
He's going along the shoreline.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.857
They're headed
for those big rocks.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.795
Uh-oh, he's gonna
see the drone!

14:26.399 --> 14:28.466
(Squawking)

14:29.603 --> 14:32.403
Annoying bird!

14:32.405 --> 14:35.206
That was a close one.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.176
CHASE:
Where'd they go?

14:38.178 --> 14:39.210
It's like they--

14:39.212 --> 14:41.412
disappeared.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.749
They have to be somewhere
along the shoreline.

14:44.751 --> 14:45.917
We need help.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.920
Pups, we need you.

14:48.922 --> 14:52.190
Skye, search the rocky beach

14:52.192 --> 14:55.860
where Humdinger and his kittens
went missing.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.729
This pup's gotta fly!

14:57.731 --> 14:59.430
Yip, yip!

14:59.432 --> 15:02.367
Wings!

15:06.773 --> 15:08.740
I don't see anything, Ryder.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.643
I'll go in closer.

15:11.645 --> 15:12.844
Yip, yip!

15:12.846 --> 15:14.512
Hold on.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.781
Ryder! I found paw prints!

15:16.783 --> 15:19.684
RYDER:
On our way.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.688
Let's follow them.

15:23.690 --> 15:28.226
Quiet as a mouse.

15:30.397 --> 15:34.465
The footprints just stop
at this rock wall.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.600
Strange.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.968
Zuma.

15:36.970 --> 15:37.902
<i> Right here, Ryder.</i>

15:37.904 --> 15:42.340
Take your hovercraft in to get
a look from the water.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.278
Whoa, I totally know that ride.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.683
I found the Kitten Carrier
hidden in the rocks.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.418
Okay, Zuma.

15:56.589 --> 15:57.388
(Sniffing)

15:57.390 --> 15:59.757
I'm smelling something like--

15:59.759 --> 16:00.725
Aah!

16:00.727 --> 16:02.460
Crabs!

16:02.462 --> 16:02.994
Shh.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.495
Quiet as a mouse.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.365
Here's the carrier,
but no kittens anywhere.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.833
There's nowhere
for them to go.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.769
It's like they vanished
into the rocks.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.939
Hmm.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.475
That's it.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.644
I don't see a cave door,

16:19.646 --> 16:22.714
but there are these
narrow holes in the rock.

16:22.716 --> 16:25.450
I know what'll fit in there.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.684
(Barking)

16:26.686 --> 16:29.554
Drone!

16:37.897 --> 16:42.333
Just need to steer it.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.534
Got it!

16:43.536 --> 16:44.936
Yes!

16:50.777 --> 16:53.811
RYDER:
It looks like some kind of
secret lair in there.

16:53.813 --> 16:57.582
RUBBLE:
They may be sneaky,
but they sure are cute.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.485
Cute? They have
a secret lair.

17:00.487 --> 17:04.455
Yeah, but they're still
pretty cute.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.925
CHASE:
Look! The scroll!

17:07.927 --> 17:08.860
MARSHALL:
I knew it.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.628
Okay, we found the scroll.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.997
But we need a plan
to get it out.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.699
We could use pup-fu.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.700
(Whistling)

17:15.702 --> 17:16.768
What's that?

17:16.770 --> 17:17.802
Great idea--

17:17.804 --> 17:18.736
Shh. Listen.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.806
Quiet as a mouse.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.979
Chase!
Zipline!

17:27.981 --> 17:29.747
(Barking)

17:29.749 --> 17:33.384
Zipline.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.695
Don't waste your time
with toys.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.398
Practice your cat-jitsu.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.639
Yes!

17:57.377 --> 17:58.910
(Sneezing)

17:58.912 --> 17:59.744
Kittens!

17:59.746 --> 18:02.580
Grab that scroll!

18:02.982 --> 18:05.550
CHASE:
No way!

18:05.552 --> 18:07.418
Let's clear this cave!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.053
Wait! Stop!

18:09.055 --> 18:10.655
(Sneezing)

18:10.657 --> 18:11.422
Too much--

18:11.424 --> 18:14.459
(Sneezing)
kitty fur!

18:14.461 --> 18:16.461
(Laughing)

18:16.463 --> 18:20.832
Hurry! Get in!

18:20.834 --> 18:21.933
(Gasping)

18:21.935 --> 18:25.570
Let's go!

18:25.572 --> 18:27.371
Quiet as a mouse!

18:28.608 --> 18:30.942
Quiet, but bad aim.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.410
(Laughing)

18:32.412 --> 18:34.779
Come on!
We need our vehicles.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.847
(Laughing)

18:35.849 --> 18:39.383
I shook off
that pesky PAW Patrol.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.087
That's what you think.

18:43.089 --> 18:46.991
Mayor Humdinger's still
heading down the beach, Ryder.

18:46.993 --> 18:50.595
We're on our way.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.731
Step on it, everybody!

18:55.902 --> 18:59.837
Let's try to get around them.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.972
Meddling mutts.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.876
You know what to do,
Catastrophe Crew.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.483
Whoa! Look out!

19:12.485 --> 19:14.619
We're having a ball!

19:14.621 --> 19:16.420
Whoa! Look out!

19:18.725 --> 19:19.590
(Gasping)

19:21.594 --> 19:23.628
Are you okay, Rubble?

19:23.630 --> 19:24.128
I'm fine,

19:24.130 --> 19:28.432
but somebody better stop that
beach from twirling around.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.667
(Chuckling)

19:29.669 --> 19:31.702
Uh-oh.

19:31.704 --> 19:35.072
Ryder, we can't see Humdinger
anymore.

19:35.074 --> 19:38.843
(Sneezing)

19:38.845 --> 19:40.611
They're still heading that way!

19:40.613 --> 19:42.780
My nose knows!

19:42.782 --> 19:46.784
Keep your eyes open.
Let's go.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.620
Ryder, how about I take
the cliff road?

19:49.622 --> 19:50.521
Okay, Marshall.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.723
Let us know
if you see anything.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.593
Let's go, go, go!

20:00.466 --> 20:03.501
Yes! We showed up
that pathetic PAW Patrol

20:03.503 --> 20:04.936
and the scroll is ours.

20:04.938 --> 20:08.906
The Kit-tastrophe Crew
will be unstoppable!

20:08.908 --> 20:10.541
(Laughing)

20:10.543 --> 20:16.681
Now to figure out what these
ancient secrets mean.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.950
Quiet as a mouse.

20:18.952 --> 20:21.519
(Laughing)

20:21.521 --> 20:23.054
Hi-ya!

20:23.056 --> 20:24.055
How did you get here?!

20:24.057 --> 20:27.758
I'm quiet as a mouse.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.126
As special guardian
of the scroll,

20:29.128 --> 20:33.030
I'm asking you to please return
what you shouldn't have taken.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.933
Taken?
But you misunderstand.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.535
I'm sure my naughty kitties

20:37.537 --> 20:41.606
had no idea
how valuable it is.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.674
But you did.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.509
Oh, very well.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.646
Return the scroll
to Marshall.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.618
(Gasping)

20:53.620 --> 20:55.586
Hi-ya!

21:00.693 --> 21:01.859
Great catch!

21:01.861 --> 21:04.829
Extra tuna for you!

21:12.572 --> 21:14.772
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:14.774 --> 21:15.873
Watch this move.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.309
Pup-fu!

21:20.546 --> 21:21.712
Nice move.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.014
But not nice enough.

21:23.016 --> 21:26.884
You know what to do,
Catastrophe Crew.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.226
(Whimpering)

21:40.700 --> 21:41.766
Stop right there!

21:41.768 --> 21:42.767
Drat you, Ryder,

21:42.769 --> 21:44.335
and your meddling mutts!

21:44.337 --> 21:45.636
Pups, you know what to do.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.772
PUPS:
Woof-ha!

21:47.774 --> 21:51.242
Hi-ya!
Ha!
Ha!

21:57.083 --> 21:57.848
Hey!
Wait for me!

21:57.850 --> 22:02.753
You-- you cowardly kittens!

22:02.755 --> 22:04.722
(Laughing)

22:04.724 --> 22:08.859
Ryder, Marshall,
all you pups.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.227
I don't know how
to thank you.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.764
You've saved my family's most
precious treasure.

22:13.766 --> 22:14.865
It's the least we can do.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.102
Whenever you're in trouble,
just yelp for help!

22:18.104 --> 22:20.705
Marshall, for your dedication
and bravery,

22:20.707 --> 22:25.910
I award you this
special golden belt.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.011
Wow!

22:27.013 --> 22:28.779
Awesome!
Pretty cool!

22:28.781 --> 22:30.981
Marshall, you mastered pup-fu.

22:30.983 --> 22:35.319
But Chickaletta has mastered
hen-kido.

22:35.321 --> 22:35.953
Chickaletta?

22:35.955 --> 22:38.756
(Clucking)

22:38.758 --> 22:40.858
¶ P-P-P-PAW Patrol ¶

22:40.860 --> 22:43.294
Whoa! What a good chicken.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.663
And what good pups.

22:45.665 --> 22:48.232
(All laughing)

22:51.170 --> 23:01.579
¶
