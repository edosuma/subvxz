15:28.493 --> 15:32.054
No, no. Look.
I came to it that day in the desert...

15:32.130 --> 15:34.565
when I walked away from him.

15:34.632 --> 15:38.227
Tess, I-l am sick
of living like this.

15:38.303 --> 15:42.467

unless I get Max to move on.

he can- he can go to hell for all I care.

for me to come here.

You can imagine.
And look.

16:01.426 --> 16:04.555

to admit that you need help...

16:04.629 --> 16:07.496
but you do.

16:07.565 --> 16:10.432

16:16.508 --> 16:18.636

in Roswell, anyway?

16:18.710 --> 16:20.644
A few months.

16:20.712 --> 16:22.806
What brought you here?

16:22.881 --> 16:25.646
I've always been into
the whole alien thing, I guess.

16:25.717 --> 16:31.053
But I have to admit, the sightseeing
has exceeded my expectations.

16:40.298 --> 16:42.630

- Shower.

- That is too young.
- That's what I said.

But you said that Romeo andjuliet
were even younger than us.

singing and dancing...

No. There's nowhere
to go back to.

30:08.205 --> 30:08.228
No. There's nowhere
to go back to.

30:11.575 --> 30:13.509
You're not there, are you?

30:13.577 --> 30:15.773
I can't help it.

30:18.448 --> 30:22.612
I love her.
What can I say?

30:23.687 --> 30:26.657
[Sighs]
You're hopeless.

30:38.368 --> 30:41.429
It didn't work.
We have to do something else.

30:41.504 --> 30:44.530
- No, I-l can't.
- You have to.

30:44.608 --> 30:49.068
<i>Do you know how hard it was for me
to tel! him that I didn't want to die for him?</i>

30:50.413 --> 30:53.075
He's the only reason
that I'm alive right now.

30:55.318 --> 30:58.447
Y-You've got to come up
with another plan.

30:59.556 --> 31:02.491
Please. Go to someone else.

31:02.559 --> 31:07.326
L- I just-
I can't do this anymore.

31:07.397 --> 31:13.097
Liz, 25 minutes before I came here,
I held Michael in my arms... dead.

31:14.571 --> 31:17.370
<i>Isabel died
two weeks before that.</i>

31:17.440 --> 31:19.408
Now you have to do this.

31:19.476 --> 31:21.604
You have to find a way.

31:22.846 --> 31:24.780
All of our lives depend on it.

31:24.848 --> 31:27.476
HOW?

31:27.550 --> 31:31.248
What can I do that's gonna
make you turn away from me?

31:31.321 --> 31:34.052
I don't know.

31:48.638 --> 31:50.572
What's wrong?

31:52.442 --> 31:55.844
- Uh, nothing.
- You look upset, Liz.

31:55.912 --> 31:58.472
L-I just can't talk about it.

31:58.548 --> 32:01.711
Oh, but I heard
about Michael and Courtney.

32:04.788 --> 32:07.018
What gets me is that-

32:07.090 --> 32:10.219
that Madame Vivian
bitch was right.

32:10.293 --> 32:12.489
I mean, granted, Michael is
the world's worst boyfriend.

32:12.562 --> 32:16.260
I know that. You know that.
America knows that.

32:16.333 --> 32:19.132
[Sighs]
But when I caught them together--

32:19.202 --> 32:21.136
that look of guilt on his face-

32:21.204 --> 32:24.504
- I've never felt so awful, Liz.
- Oh, my God.

32:24.574 --> 32:27.339
I know. I mean,
I guess it's a good thing, you know...

32:27.410 --> 32:32.348
'cause when I saw that, I realized there
was nothing he could do to make up for it.

32:32.415 --> 32:34.509
I know it's over.

32:40.390 --> 32:43.690
I need your help.

32:51.735 --> 32:56.002
So, we haven't really,
uh, talked much lately.

32:56.072 --> 32:58.700
Yeah. How's it going?

32:58.775 --> 33:01.938
- Not bad. I found Buddha.
- I don't think this is a good plan.

33:02.011 --> 33:04.673
What are you talking about?

33:04.748 --> 33:06.842
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

33:06.916 --> 33:09.146
I would never
bejealous of Kyle.

33:10.186 --> 33:12.314
Can you turn around?

33:17.660 --> 33:21.619
So that's like meditation, right?
Incense, that sort of thing?

33:21.698 --> 33:24.827
It's, uh, it's really about approaching life
from a spiritual place...

33:24.901 --> 33:27.233
and becoming in tune
with different planes of existence.

33:27.303 --> 33:30.136
- What a line of crap.
- Am I taking my boxers off?

33:30.206 --> 33:32.197
No. Undergarments stay on.

33:32.275 --> 33:34.300
<i>[ Kyle]

33:35.779 --> 33:39.841

- What? No. I'm talking about the towel.

34:10.647 --> 34:14.049
I meditated
on this entire situation...

and I'm, uh,
I'm at peace with it.

34:17.219 --> 34:21.248

34:21.324 --> 34:24.453

Yeah. Um, Kyle, look.
I just wanna make sure that I--

34:27.429 --> 34:31.924

that we're not gonna-

34:32.001 --> 34:35.197

- And when we kiss-
