WEBVTT

01:18.960 --> 01:20.689
<i>Two households,</i>

01:20.840 --> 01:22.683
<i>both alike in dignity,</i>

01:22.840 --> 01:25.764
<i>in Fair Verona,
where we lay our scene,</i>

01:25.920 --> 01:29.003
<i>from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,</i>

01:29.160 --> 01:32.881
<i>where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.</i>

01:33.040 --> 01:35.566
<i>And so the prince
has called a tournament</i>

01:35.720 --> 01:38.963
<i>to keep the battle
from the city streets.</i>

01:39.160 --> 01:41.845
<i>Now rival Capulets
and Montagues,</i>

01:42.000 --> 01:46.210
<i>they try their strength
to gain the royal ring.</i>

01:51.760 --> 01:52.841
Ride, cousin!

02:41.200 --> 02:43.885
We here declare Mercutio,

02:44.040 --> 02:46.691
from the house of Montague,
our champion.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.084
And so I bid you all
enjoy the day.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.920
Juliet?
Juliet, please.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.043
My lady and my lord
will soon be home

03:08.200 --> 03:09.645
with news of the tournament.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.962
Then hurry, nurse.
Why do you dally so?

03:12.120 --> 03:15.442
Oh, I should so hurry
till my heart gives out.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.206
Your heart is made
of sterner stuff than that.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.840
Your heart is made
of sterner stuff...

03:22.480 --> 03:25.689
that you should laugh
to see me so wore out.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.161
I keep you fast to make you
young and strong.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.962
Here,
what about this one?

03:41.600 --> 03:45.571
Do you not choke to see Lord
Tybalt bested by a Montague dog?

03:45.720 --> 03:47.484
Leave it. The quarrel
is between our masters.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.881
The quarrel is between
our masters and us, their men.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.682
Stop!

04:01.640 --> 04:02.926
Stop!

04:03.080 --> 04:05.048
Put down your sword!
You know not what you do.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.167
Hold up there.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.689
Turn now, Benvolio,
and look upon thy death.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.447
Tybalt, I do but keep the peace.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.648
Put up your sword or manage it
to part these men with me.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.565
What? Do you draw your sword
and talk of peace?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.721
I hate the word as I hate hell,

04:21.880 --> 04:24.121
all Montagues and thee.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.481
Back, Tybalt!
You argue with a child.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.689
Turn now and fight
your equal if you dare.

04:42.320 --> 04:46.166
Old Montague doth flourish
his blade in spite of me!

04:46.320 --> 04:48.084
- No!
- Enough!

04:48.240 --> 04:50.811
The prince! The prince!

04:50.960 --> 04:54.169
Rebellious subjects!
Stop this!

04:54.320 --> 04:58.644
Enemies to peace would stain
the pleasure of a tournament

04:58.800 --> 05:00.484
with bitter blood?

05:00.640 --> 05:03.610
Throw your ill-tempered
weapons to the ground...

05:04.400 --> 05:06.323
and hear the sentence
of your angry prince.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.051
Three civil brawls,

05:09.240 --> 05:13.131
bred of a foolish word by thee,
Lord Capulet or Montague,

05:13.280 --> 05:16.727
have thrice destroyed
the calm of our streets.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.211
If ever you disturb
our town again,

05:20.360 --> 05:23.284
your lives will pay the
price for the offense.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.370
You, Capulet,
you go along with me.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.410
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.083
And now, on pain of death,
all fighting men depart.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.921
- Good afternoon, my cousin.
- Is it so?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.764
I thought it should be night.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.445
Not much past 4:00.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.762
When I am sad,
the hours seem long.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.806
What sadness
lengthens Romeo's hours?

05:59.000 --> 06:03.085
I lack the thing which, if I
had it, would make them short.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.925
I see. You're in love.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.088
- How was the tournament?
- It served its turn...

06:10.120 --> 06:12.168
to launch another
clash with Capulets.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.243
So you must fence with hate,
and I with love.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.804
Love is a harsh tyrant
where he rules.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.928
Love is a smoke,

06:22.480 --> 06:24.562
raised on the fume of sighs,

06:24.720 --> 06:28.281
a madness drenched in syrup
and choked with rage.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.010
May I not know
who it is you love?

06:31.480 --> 06:33.209
I love a woman.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.723
- That much I found unaided.
- Who loves me not.

06:37.880 --> 06:43.330
Sweet cousin, say not so,
but may I have a name?

06:45.440 --> 06:46.362
Rosaline.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.045
Rosaline?

06:49.080 --> 06:50.889
- The niece of Lord Capulet?
- The same.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.846
Be ruled by me
and forget to think of her.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.731
Oh, teach me how
I should forget to think.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.370
Love will not
call on you but once,

06:59.560 --> 07:01.688
nor stay forever when he comes.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.684
Release your eyes.
Be glad she does not care.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.411
- Examine other beauties.
- To what purpose?

07:07.560 --> 07:09.369
Cousin, I pray
you change your mind.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.000
My child is still a stranger
to this world.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.804
Let two more summers
wither in their pride

07:15.960 --> 07:17.803
before we judge her right
to be a wife.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.361
Younger than she
are happy mothers now.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.843
Juliet is my only living child.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.765
She's the hopeful lady
of my earth...

07:30.200 --> 07:32.487
but woo her, gentle Paris.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.648
Win her heart.

07:34.800 --> 07:39.727
Now, Peter, sir,
come hither, pray.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.486
Take this list...

07:46.360 --> 07:47.805
of the last and final names,

07:47.960 --> 07:50.406
search them through Verona,
bid them come

07:50.560 --> 07:54.531
to feast and welcome
at my house this night.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.567
Go.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.091
Find out those men
whose names are written here.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.325
I must first find out
what names he here has writ.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.765
Pray you, sir.
Can you read?

08:17.920 --> 08:20.082
Aye. If I know the letters
and the language.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.323
Stay, fellow.
I can read.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.446
"Signor Martino
and his wife and daughters,

08:27.600 --> 08:29.762
Count Anselme and his
beauteous sisters,

08:29.920 --> 08:31.570
the lady widow of Vitravio,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.961
Signor Placentio
and his lovely wife,

08:34.120 --> 08:35.884
my nephew, Count Tybalt,

08:36.039 --> 08:38.042
and Lucio and lively Helena,

08:38.240 --> 08:40.971
my fairness, Rosaline."
What assembly is this?

08:41.159 --> 08:42.684
A masked gathering tonight
at our house.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.650
- Who's house?
- My master, the great Lord Capulet.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.370
If you not be
of the House of Montague,

08:47.520 --> 08:49.010
you're right welcome
for your help.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.650
I bid you thanks.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.686
So Rosaline sups
with Capulet this night.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.127
Do but compare her face
with some I know,

08:59.280 --> 09:01.567
and I will make you think
your swan a crow.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.882
As if there could be
fairer than my love.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.371
I'll go tonight,

09:05.560 --> 09:09.087
but only to rejoice and worship
at the glory of my choice.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.401
Hmm.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.920
Now, stay here.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.646
Heavens, child.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.564
- What are you thinking?
- Go, go, go on.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.961
Make haste.
The guests will be long gone

09:28.120 --> 09:30.168
ere you are ready
to receive them.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.041
What is it, Mother?

09:34.800 --> 09:37.246
Juliet...

09:37.400 --> 09:41.200
you're a woman now.
-  Not a woman.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.169
Well, she's nearly a woman.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.604
Nearly, but not yet.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.683
Nurse, I know my daughter's age.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.764
I think of her birth
as if 'twere yesterday.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.848
I remember, too,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.480
one day when she did fall
and cut her brow,

09:56.640 --> 09:58.847
my husband, rest his soul,
picked up the child.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.002
"Why do you fall
on your face?" says he,

10:01.200 --> 10:03.601
"You will fall backward
when you have more wit."

10:03.760 --> 10:06.047
And looking up at him,
the child said, "Yes."

10:06.200 --> 10:08.680
Enough of this. I pray you,
hold your peace.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.330
Yet, madam, I must laugh
to think a child

10:10.480 --> 10:12.608
could stop crying like that
and then say "yes" to Jack.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.206
Nurse, I pray you, stop.
I beg.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.567
Peace, I have done.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.808
But I must say,
you were the prettiest babe

10:19.960 --> 10:22.042
I ever nursed till now.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.487
If I could live to see you wed,
I'll have my wish.

10:24.680 --> 10:29.288
And that is the very theme
that I came to talk about.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.007
Tell me, daughter,
what do you think of marriage?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.726
- I never think of it.
- Well, think of it now.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.046
Younger than you are mothers.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.129
I was your mother, too,
when I was your age.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.520
I know it.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.483
Count Paris wants you
for his wife and love.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.244
Count Paris?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.402
So, daughter...

10:55.120 --> 10:58.727
can you love the man?
- I hardly know him.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.168
Then learn to know him
at the feast tonight.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.482
Seek how you feel.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.844
Study his eyes
and read the message there.

11:09.840 --> 11:10.807
See...

11:10.960 --> 11:12.803
if you can be happy with him.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.124
I'll look and try to like him,
if that is my parents' wish.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.611
Should we attempt
to talk our way inside

11:27.760 --> 11:29.922
or sweep past in a crowd
without a word?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.929
Say nothing,
lest you say too much.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.560
We will not challenge them
for fear they challenge us.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.290
We'll enter,
take the lady's measure,

11:36.440 --> 11:38.204
and having taken it, depart.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.567
Nay, gentle Romeo,
we must see you dance.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.171
Not I, Mercutio.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.130
You have the dancing shoes
and dancing feet to fill them.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.124
My soul is made of lead.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.123
It sticks me to the ground,
I cannot move.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.329
You are a lover.
Borrow Cupid's wings and fly.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.366
But should we enter?

12:02.520 --> 12:05.842
I start to fear some consequence
yet hanging in the stars

12:06.000 --> 12:07.764
shall bitterly begin
this fearful date.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.810
Maybe we should consider
what we do.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.611
I dreamed a dream last night.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.888
And so did I.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.485
Well, what was yours?

12:17.640 --> 12:19.165
That dreamers often lie.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.084
In bed asleep,
where they do dream things true.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.483
Ha! Then I see Queen Mab
has been with you.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.011
She is the fairies' midwife,

12:26.160 --> 12:30.245
and she comes in shape no bigger
than an agate stone

12:30.400 --> 12:31.970
on the forefinger
of an alderman,

12:32.120 --> 12:33.724
drawn with a team
of little atomies,

12:33.880 --> 12:36.531
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.047
Her chariot
is an empty hazelnut,

12:39.200 --> 12:42.727
and in this state,
she gallops night by night

12:42.880 --> 12:45.451
through lovers brains,
and then they dream of love,

12:45.600 --> 12:48.410
o'er courtiers knees that dream
on curtsies straight,

12:48.560 --> 12:53.487
o'er lawyers fingers,
who straight dream on fees,

12:53.640 --> 12:56.450
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.126
Peace, peace, Mercutio, enough.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.123
You talk of nothing.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.520
True, I talk of dreams,

13:04.720 --> 13:06.449
which are the children
of an idle brain

13:06.600 --> 13:08.170
begot of nothing
but vain fantasy,

13:08.320 --> 13:10.243
which is as thin
of substance as the air

13:10.400 --> 13:12.641
and more inconstant
than the wind.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.280
Much more of this,
and we shall be too late.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.246
Come, let us brave our
fears and steer our course.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.807
Whatever it may prove.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.088
On, lusty gentlemen.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.690
Welcome, gentlemen.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.571
Ladies that have their toes
unplagued with corns

13:37.720 --> 13:38.926
will walk about with you.

13:43.480 --> 13:47.121
I welcome you all.
Come, musicians play.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.765
A hall, a hall.
Make room.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.931
Methinks we have
the pick of what's on show.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.367
They all look hungrier
than a starving dog.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.161
My lady Juliet.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.000
Count Paris.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.845
Can I beseech that you will
pity me enough to dance

15:06.000 --> 15:08.480
and warm my evening
with a heavenly smile?

15:08.640 --> 15:12.201
Keep your unmannered
hand for lesser prey...

15:12.360 --> 15:14.727
and leave the fair one
to her own device.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.524
Is that not Rosaline?

15:25.720 --> 15:27.848
Aye, it is she.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.129
Should you not start
to make your case?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.722
My case?
When you carried me hither,

15:37.880 --> 15:40.690
that I might see
I have no case to make?

15:40.840 --> 15:43.320
Go, you speak with her.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.571
The Montagues
in Capulet's domain?

15:50.760 --> 15:53.081
Messer Benvolio,
have you all run mad?

15:53.240 --> 15:58.724
He that I stand for has run mad
for love of your green eyes.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.566
Since Romeo is here,
why is he in need of deputies?

16:02.720 --> 16:05.166
Of course, he means
to plead his cause himself.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.884
Indeed.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.964
From where we stand,
he looks well occupied.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.364
The lady Rosaline
is well disposed

16:28.520 --> 16:30.761
but trembles for your safety.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.846
What lady is that
who doth enrich

16:34.000 --> 16:35.001
the hand of yonder knight?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.764
I do not know.

16:37.720 --> 16:38.767
But Rosaline...

16:38.920 --> 16:40.888
Oh, she does teach
the torches to burn bright.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.771
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night

16:43.920 --> 16:47.049
like a fine jewel
in an Ethiope's ear.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.761
Beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.050
So shows the snowy dove
trooping with crows,

16:55.240 --> 16:58.130
as yonder lady o'er
her fellow shows.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.442
But what of your
old love, Rosaline?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.963
Did my heart love till now?

17:06.599 --> 17:07.964
Forswear the sight.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.204
I never saw true beauty
till this night.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.165
- Sirrah, I must protest.
- I have a prior claim.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.482
Count Paris,
come dance with me.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.568
What claim is that?

17:27.720 --> 17:29.848
The claim of love
that ever must be heard.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.010
Then shall I take
advantage of this turn,

17:40.200 --> 17:42.601
try my chances with fair Rosaline?

18:06.320 --> 18:09.085
Now, by the shield
and honor of my blood,

18:09.240 --> 18:10.765
to strike him dead,
I hold it not a sin.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.082
Why, how now, Tybalt,
why storm you so?

18:13.240 --> 18:15.766
Uncle, the man Juliet
is with is a Montague.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.842
Young Romeo, is it?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.363
It's him, that villain Romeo.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.608
Content thee, gentle coz.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.005
Let him alone.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.409
You heard the prince's
warning at the joust.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.360
To harm a Montague
under this roof means riot,

18:43.520 --> 18:45.284
and in its bloody wake,
our deaths.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.602
I would not for
the wealth of all the town

18:47.760 --> 18:49.569
let any harm beset him
in my house.

18:49.720 --> 18:50.767
I'll not endure it.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.888
You will endure it,
for I say you will.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.451
Am I master here or you?

18:54.600 --> 18:56.409
You'll make a mutiny
among the guests.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.449
You will set cock-a-hoop,
you'll be the man!

18:58.600 --> 19:00.807
- Uncle, 'tis a shame!
- Go to, go to.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.726
You shall contrary me.
You are a princox, go.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.726
Good my lord husband,
why are you so hot?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.086
He may be hot,
but I am hotter still

19:10.240 --> 19:12.447
to see a Montague
at leisure here.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.886
The Morisca!

19:14.040 --> 19:15.565
Morisca?

19:15.720 --> 19:19.247
Why, what a perfect
dance for our amusement.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.084
To find the dance
that's fit for Romeo,

19:21.240 --> 19:23.322
we first need to put
a rope around his neck.

19:23.480 --> 19:27.883
Nay, cousin, come,
tread a length with me,

19:28.040 --> 19:29.724
and I shall coax you
into company.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.281
Lead her, gentle nephew,
in a country dance

19:32.480 --> 19:35.370
that we may see your
anger is forsworn.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.561
If you so order, Uncle,
but be warned,

19:44.720 --> 19:47.246
this foul invasion,
that you think so sweet,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.528
shall turn to bitter gall
before the end.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.441
Speak, sir.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.809
You are too grave for one
who cuts a country dance.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.446
If I profane with
my own worthiest hand

20:49.640 --> 20:51.449
this holy shrine...

20:53.840 --> 20:56.889
my lips, two blushing pilgrims,

20:57.040 --> 21:00.806
ready stand to smooth that rough
touch with a tender kiss.

21:07.480 --> 21:11.201
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much.

21:13.040 --> 21:16.089
Which mannerly devotion
shows in this,

21:16.240 --> 21:19.084
for saints have hands
that pilgrim's hands do touch,

21:19.240 --> 21:21.208
palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.204
Have saints not lips,
and holy palmers, too?

21:24.360 --> 21:26.806
Aye, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.691
Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.729
They pray,

21:31.880 --> 21:34.042
grant thou, lest faith
turn to despair.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.771
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.570
Then move not...

21:44.880 --> 21:47.201
while my prayers'
effect I take.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.046
Thus from my lips,
by yours, my sin is purged.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.124
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.203
Sin from my lips?

22:11.360 --> 22:14.409
Oh, trespass sweetly urged.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.090
Give me my sin again.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.329
You kiss by the book.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.326
Madam... your mother
craves a word with you.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.810
Who is her mother?

22:51.960 --> 22:54.167
Her mother is
the lady of the house.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.001
- You mean she's a Capulet?
- She is.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.047
And I tell you, he that
can lay hold of Juliet

23:02.200 --> 23:03.440
shall have the chinks.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.683
Oh, my dear God.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.129
My life is my foe's debt.

23:24.360 --> 23:28.046
Know you the man
my cousin has made welcome?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.841
Nay, but he would seem
a goodly youth.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.331
Goodly and deadly.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.005
He is Romeo,

23:35.160 --> 23:37.003
hope of the House of Montague.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.766
Come hither, Nurse.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.522
Who is that gentleman
going through the door?

23:50.640 --> 23:53.086
His name is Romeo
and a Montague.

23:53.280 --> 23:56.409
The only son
of your great enemy.

24:02.200 --> 24:05.204
My only love sprung
from my only hate.

24:06.840 --> 24:09.241
To early seen unknown
and known too late.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.801
What's this? What's this?

24:14.040 --> 24:15.326
It's nothing.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.929
A somber face
to wear after a ball.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.809
If I am young,
must I always be glad?

24:34.960 --> 24:36.928
No blaggard then, has
cracked your peace of mind?

24:37.120 --> 24:40.363
- What blaggard would this be?
- None I would name...

24:41.720 --> 24:43.404
nor let their name
be spoken in this house.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.248
Cousin, I love thee.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.890
Tybalt, I know it.

24:49.040 --> 24:52.362
Your honor is as dear
to me as life.

24:56.760 --> 25:00.207
And with that warming thought,
I'll take my leave.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.644
Romeo?

25:13.600 --> 25:15.045
Romeo!

25:15.240 --> 25:17.368
Can I go home
when all my heart is here?

25:17.520 --> 25:19.329
Cousin Romeo?

25:19.480 --> 25:20.970
Romeo?

25:21.160 --> 25:23.606
Should I go home
when all my heart is here?

25:23.760 --> 25:26.525
Romeo!

25:26.680 --> 25:28.569
Romeo?

25:30.320 --> 25:33.449
Romeo?
Cousin Romeo?

25:33.600 --> 25:38.640
He is wise, and on my life,
has stolen home to bed.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.290
He ran this way.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.090
I know
he's jumped the wall.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.651
Let's call him, good Mercutio.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.962
Romeo?

25:46.120 --> 25:47.121
Suitor!

25:48.480 --> 25:49.811
Madman!

25:51.120 --> 25:53.805
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.201
But soft, what light through
yonder window breaks?

26:11.040 --> 26:14.886
It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.606
Arise, fair sun
and kill the envious moon

26:18.800 --> 26:20.484
who's already sick
and pale with grief

26:20.680 --> 26:23.684
that thou, her maid,
are far more fair than she.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.045
Wait...

26:33.440 --> 26:34.441
it is my lady.

26:37.800 --> 26:38.687
Oh, it is my love.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.487
Oh, that she knew she were.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.131
The brightness of her cheek
would shame the stars

26:46.280 --> 26:48.362
as daylight doth a lamp.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.729
Her eyes set in heaven
would give forth such light

26:51.920 --> 26:54.287
that birds would sing
and think it were not night.

26:56.680 --> 27:00.321
See how she leans her
cheek upon her hand.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.923
Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand

27:04.080 --> 27:06.686
that I might touch that cheek.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.530
Ah, me.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.091
She speaks.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.606
Oh, speak again, bright angel.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.128
Oh, Romeo, Romeo,

27:18.400 --> 27:20.323
where for art thou, Romeo?

27:24.720 --> 27:27.246
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name,

27:27.400 --> 27:29.164
or if thou wilt not,
but be sworn my love,

27:29.320 --> 27:31.004
and I'll no longer be
a Capulet.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.088
Shall I hear more
or shall I speak at this?

27:35.240 --> 27:37.971
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.930
You'd be yourself
if you were not called Montague.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.850
What's in a name?

27:46.200 --> 27:49.249
That which we call a rose by any
other name would smell as sweet.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.210
So Romeo would.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.248
Romeo, cast off thy name,
and for that name,

27:56.440 --> 27:58.329
which is no part of you,
take all of me.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.721
I take you at your word.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.201
Call me your love, and I'll be
new baptized henceforth.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.840
- I never will be Romeo.
- What man are you

28:06.000 --> 28:08.207
that hides within the shadows
of the night to spy on me?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.048
I know not how to
tell you who I am.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.883
My name, dear saint,

28:15.040 --> 28:18.840
is hateful to myself
because it is an enemy to you.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.924
I have not heard you
speak a hundred words,

28:22.080 --> 28:24.401
yet I do know the sound
of that sweet voice.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.961
Are you not Romeo
and a Montague?

28:27.120 --> 28:29.805
Neither, dear love,
if either you dislike.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.120
Why have you come?

28:35.280 --> 28:38.124
This place is death if any
of my kinsmen find you here.

28:38.320 --> 28:41.483
With love's light wings
did I o'er perch these walls...

28:43.040 --> 28:45.611
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

28:45.760 --> 28:49.401
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.801
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.161
To see you look severe

28:54.320 --> 28:56.448
more frightens me than
20 of their swords.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.484
Look you but sweet, and I am
proof against their enmity.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.845
I would not for the world
they saw you here.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.562
But I would not have missed
the words you spoke.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.761
I blush to think
what you have heard tonight.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.570
If I should ask you now for vows of
love, I know you would say aye...

29:19.640 --> 29:21.529
but if you swear,
you may prove false.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.965
They say that Jove does
laugh at lovers' perjuries.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.649
And will you now
call me too fast?

29:27.800 --> 29:30.849
When had you not heard me,
I should be slow as ice.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.048
Romeo, trust me, and
I will prove more true

29:33.200 --> 29:35.168
than those who play the game
with far more cunning wit.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.766
Lady, by yonder moon I swear

29:37.960 --> 29:40.008
that tips with silver
all the fruit tree tops.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.447
Oh, swear not by the moon,
the inconstant moon

29:42.600 --> 29:44.602
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

29:44.800 --> 29:46.529
lest that your love prove
likewise variable.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.087
What shall I swear by?

29:49.240 --> 29:53.165
Do not swear at all,
and listen hard.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.527
Are we too rash,
too unadvised, too quick?

29:55.680 --> 29:58.923
No, for this bud of love
in summer's breath

29:59.080 --> 30:02.323
will prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.329
- I promise.
- Juliet?

30:06.480 --> 30:07.766
Go and good night,

30:07.920 --> 30:11.129
and let sweet rest come to your
heart and mine within my breast.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.169
But will you leave me
so unsatisfied?

30:15.720 --> 30:17.529
What satisfaction
would you have tonight?

30:18.560 --> 30:21.484
The exchange of your love's
faithful vow for mine.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.086
I gave you mine
before you did request it.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.810
My lady?

30:27.920 --> 30:29.763
- Madam?
- Anon, good nurse.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.251
Sweet Montague, be true.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.767
Stay here a while,
and I will come again.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.889
I'm afraid all this is
but a dream.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.249
Too flattering sweet
to be substantial.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.566
Think if your love be pure,
your purpose marriage?

30:48.320 --> 30:50.482
It is, my lady.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.482
Then I will send to you
to learn my fate,

30:53.640 --> 30:55.404
where and what time
we will perform the rite,

30:55.560 --> 30:57.881
and all my fortunes
at your feet I lay

30:58.080 --> 31:00.845
and follow you, my lord,
throughout the world.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.610
Juliet!

31:04.200 --> 31:05.725
My lady?

31:09.400 --> 31:10.811
A thousand times, good night.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.962
A thousand times the worse,
to miss your light.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.407
- Romeo.
- My love.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.689
What time tomorrow
shall I send to you?

31:35.840 --> 31:39.049
- At 9:00.
- I will not fail.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.168
'Tis 20 years till then.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.004
I have forgotten
why I called you back.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.288
Let me stand here
till you remember it.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.646
I should forget
to have thee still stand there,

31:49.840 --> 31:52.161
remembering how
I love thy company.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.851
And I'll still stay
to have thee still forget,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.048
forgetting any other
home but this.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.885
Good night, good night.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.169
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

32:19.320 --> 32:22.210
Let us just say good night
till it be morrow.

32:27.440 --> 32:31.525
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes,
peace in thy breast.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.001
Oh! Lady, come in.
You will catch a chill.

32:37.160 --> 32:41.529
Would I were sleep and peace,
so sweet to rest.

32:47.600 --> 32:51.650
The earth is nature's mother
and her tomb.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.885
Within the petal trim
of this small flower,

32:56.040 --> 33:01.251
poison has residence
and medicine power.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.404
Boiled and mixed, the smell
will bring us health.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.485
- And swallowed?
- The result is instant death.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.203
Good morning, Father.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.249
Romeo!

33:17.160 --> 33:19.447
Up and about in early morn.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.610
I do not look to see
the young at dawn.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.491
Care keeps the old awake
and wakes them soon,

33:25.640 --> 33:28.371
but young men sleep
a golden sleep till noon.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.689
Or if they don't,
and here I'll guess it right,

33:33.840 --> 33:37.526
our Romeo hath not been
in bed tonight.

33:37.680 --> 33:41.241
That last is true,
but a sweet rest was mine.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.167
God pardon sin.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.446
Were you with Rosaline?

33:52.720 --> 33:57.009
Ah, I pray you were not
playing Satan's game.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.447
Who is Rosaline?
I have forgot the name.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.809
That's good, my son.
Where then have you been?

34:03.960 --> 34:06.804
I'll tell you, 'ere you
ask it me again.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.167
Oh, Father,
know my heart's desire

34:09.320 --> 34:11.641
is set on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.121
As mine on hers,
so hers is set as well.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.446
And how we met and woo'd,

34:15.600 --> 34:18.206
and how I fell I'll say
as we walk back.

34:18.360 --> 34:22.284
But this I pray:
you consent to marry us today.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.722
Holy St. Francis!

34:28.040 --> 34:29.643
What a change is here.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.531
Why is she cast off,
that you did love so dear?

34:32.679 --> 34:34.808
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine

34:34.960 --> 34:37.042
has washed your sallow
cheeks for Rosaline!

34:37.199 --> 34:39.009
You scolded me for
loving Rosaline.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.243
I scolded you
for moping like a child.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.607
I'd not believe
you'd tasted true love's joy.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.603
Then scold no more, for God has
taught me now to know true love,

34:47.760 --> 34:49.524
and Juliet has her face.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.802
Speak you so,
though she be a Capulet?

34:55.960 --> 34:58.327
What care I for
the quarrels of the past?

34:58.480 --> 35:00.642
Or rivalries now
buried in the tomb?

35:01.720 --> 35:02.801
Well, well.

35:05.680 --> 35:09.207
If this could carry
all before...

35:09.360 --> 35:12.284
I think I see a chance
to end the city's strife.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.361
If, as I pray, your marriage
should prove sweet,

35:17.520 --> 35:21.525
you'll turn your families'
rancor to pure love.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.249
Come... you waverer,
and go along with me.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.482
I'll grant your wish...

35:29.960 --> 35:31.724
and be your wedding priest.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.723
Where then is our Romeo?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.723
Did he come home last night?

35:41.880 --> 35:43.484
Not to this house.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.404
I've spoken with his man.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.051
Mercutio, there's news.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.567
Tybalt has sent a letter here,
addressed to him.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.480
A challenge on my life.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.926
Which Romeo will meet.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.560
Alas, poor Romeo,
he's already dead.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.240
Why?
Who and what is Tybalt,

36:01.400 --> 36:03.129
that he should be
so sure of victory?

36:03.280 --> 36:05.851
More than a prince of cats,
I tell you now.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.606
He fights like a music player,
all precision,

36:08.760 --> 36:11.081
and keeps his time
and distance perfect play.

36:11.240 --> 36:14.164
With one and two and three,
and in your chest.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.606
He's a gentleman and duelist,

36:15.760 --> 36:18.286
and none who fight him
live to tell the tale.

36:18.440 --> 36:21.171
Ah, gentlemen. I hope you've
helped to cover my tracks.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.646
Where did you vanish
to last night?

36:22.800 --> 36:24.768
You gave us both
the slip most prettily.

36:24.920 --> 36:27.287
Pardon, Mercutio,
I was much taken up.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.920
At such a time a man
may lose his grace.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.690
And more besides.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.968
Nay, we forgive you,
for you are Romeo again.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.521
Is this not better now
than groaning still for love?

36:36.680 --> 36:38.330
Now you are sociable.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.448
Great love will make
us only into fools.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.408
Stop there.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.522
Romeo, there's a letter
come for you.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.082
I fear it is a challenge
from Count Tybalt,

36:48.240 --> 36:50.288
which will not brook
delay in your reply.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.727
- You could soothe his rage...
- Excuse me, both, I prithee.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.291
Cousin?
Where are you going?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.767
Romeo! This heavy matter
cannot be ignored!

37:04.960 --> 37:07.566
Good sir,
I desire some talk with you.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.404
What tired old bawd is this?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.881
And who is he that wears
the hated coat of Capulet?

37:12.080 --> 37:13.809
Go to. I would walk
a while with her.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.126
Will we see you
at your father's dinner?

37:15.280 --> 37:17.487
Of course.
I'll be there.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.889
Why was the man so rude?

37:29.040 --> 37:30.565
That liked to use
his tongue to flay

37:30.720 --> 37:32.210
and wound a poor old woman?

37:32.360 --> 37:35.364
He is much enamored by
the sound of his own voice.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.324
And you stand by
and suffer such a knave

37:37.520 --> 37:39.010
to use me at his pleasure?

37:39.160 --> 37:40.924
If I knew any man
to use you for his pleasure,

37:41.080 --> 37:43.606
my weapon will be
quickly out, I swear.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.969
Now, before God, I'm so vexed
every part about me quivers.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.250
So, to the business.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.687
- My young lady, Juliet...
- What of her?

37:54.840 --> 37:57.491
She bade me seek you out
and say...

37:57.640 --> 38:00.325
First, if you should
do double with her,

38:00.480 --> 38:01.481
you will have me to answer to.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.642
- Nurse, I do protest.
- I'll tell her.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.569
Just listen.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.205
She must gain her mother's word

38:07.360 --> 38:09.203
to make confession
later on today.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.328
Let her but come
to Father Laurence's cell.

38:11.480 --> 38:14.723
There she will be absolved
and married, too.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.530
This afternoon, a bride?

38:16.680 --> 38:19.445
Farewell, be trusty and
commend me to your mistress.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.648
I... There's one thing more.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.006
What is it?

38:23.160 --> 38:26.130
There is a nobleman
in town, one Paris,

38:26.320 --> 38:28.209
who plans to marry
and lie with her.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.010
- And does she like him?
- Never!

38:30.200 --> 38:32.407
She would as soon have lain
with a stinking toad.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.086
Her thoughts are all with you,
as I have taunted her.

38:35.240 --> 38:38.403
- But you should know of him.
- And so I do.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.962
- And now commend me to my lady.
- I will.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.043
A thousand times.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.603
Why, my darling Nurse,
what news?

38:55.760 --> 38:57.125
- Tell me you found him.
- Oh...

38:57.280 --> 38:59.965
Oh! Oh...

39:00.120 --> 39:01.531
Good, sweet Nurse...

39:03.600 --> 39:06.763
Oh, Lord, you look so sad.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.287
Whatever news your bring,
cast off your gloom,

39:09.440 --> 39:11.204
and if your tale be glad,
then do not punish me

39:11.360 --> 39:12.805
by wearing such
a mask of tragedy.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.928
I'm so weary,
let me rest awhile.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.771
Oh, my bones ache
after the day I've had.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.968
I would exchange my bones
for all your news.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.360
Please speak, I pray you.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.806
Dear sweet Nurse, do tell.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.128
What's the rush?
A minute's patience, please!

39:25.280 --> 39:27.442
Can you not see
I'm out of breath?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.443
Are you out of breath when you
have breath to say to me

39:29.600 --> 39:32.080
that you are out of breath?
Is your news good or bad?

39:32.240 --> 39:35.005
Just answer that. Say either
and I'll wait to hear the rest.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.730
Let me just know
if it is good or bad.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.529
Well...

39:45.120 --> 39:46.645
I must say

39:46.800 --> 39:49.804
you have good taste in men.

39:50.680 --> 39:55.163
That Romeo's face
is handsome as the dawn.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.130
His body...

39:58.280 --> 40:03.923
figure, leg, foot
excel against the finest.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.641
His manners might improve,
but there is time.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.161
Now... have you dined already?

40:10.320 --> 40:11.560
Not yet.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.683
But Nurse, I knew
all this before.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.922
What says he of our marriage?
What of that?

40:16.080 --> 40:18.321
Lord, how my head aches.
Oh, what a head I have.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.046
It throbs as it would
break in 20 bits.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.009
And my back,
my back is killing me!

40:23.160 --> 40:24.924
It's all your fault
for sending me to town.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.526
In future,
take your messages yourself.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.889
In mercy, pity me!
What says my Romeo?

40:38.000 --> 40:41.243
Can you have leave today,
to make confession?

40:42.200 --> 40:44.043
I could.

40:44.200 --> 40:48.444
Then, go you from here
to Father Laurence's cell...

40:52.040 --> 40:53.451
you'll find a husband...

40:54.800 --> 40:57.121
keen to make you wife.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.882
But not until you've had a bath.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.245
I pray the heavens
smile upon this act,

41:17.400 --> 41:20.085
and do not punish us
with later sorrow.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.844
Amen.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.770
But come what sorrow can,

41:25.960 --> 41:27.769
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy

41:27.960 --> 41:30.201
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.169
Do thou but close our hands
with holy words...

41:34.040 --> 41:35.769
then love, devouring death,
do what he dare,

41:35.920 --> 41:37.968
it is enough
that I can call her mine.

41:38.120 --> 41:42.967
These violent passions
can have violent ends.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.930
And blaze up like gunpowder,
in their fiery glory,

41:46.080 --> 41:48.845
consuming themselves
and others.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.925
The sweetest honey
sickens when over-ate,

41:53.080 --> 41:55.082
defeating its own delight.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.005
Therefore, be moderate.
Long-lasting love must be.

42:00.200 --> 42:04.728
Love too fast can prove falser
than love too slow.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.088
Good evening
to my dearest confessor.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.846
Romeo gives thanks
to see you here.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.810
I owe those thanks to him
with all my heart.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.689
Oh, Juliet, if your heart,
like mine, is full

42:21.840 --> 42:23.808
and you have greater
skill than I to speak,

42:23.960 --> 42:26.122
then tell the joy
that waits us both this night.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.047
I cannot tell of
what is limitless.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.249
They are but beggars
who can count their worth.

42:33.440 --> 42:36.444
Enough of love talk.
Come along with me.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.331
For we will make short work
of binding oaths,

42:39.480 --> 42:41.801
and holy church
shall join two into one.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.771
Romeo...

43:07.880 --> 43:08.881
Juliet...

43:38.960 --> 43:40.405
Amen.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.441
- Amen.
- Amen.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.525
Juliet.

44:49.680 --> 44:50.806
My lady Juliet.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.770
Scarcely were you both gone
and on your way,

44:53.960 --> 44:56.042
a messenger
from Lord Capulet arrived.

44:57.160 --> 44:59.891
Your cousin Tybalt
has set forth in such a rage.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.849
There's trouble in the offing.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.490
Your father bids you hurry back.

45:03.640 --> 45:04.801
I will.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.281
Nurse, you go with her.
See her safely home.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.441
Till tonight.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.324
Which is a year away.

45:12.520 --> 45:14.602
Only a year?

45:14.760 --> 45:16.524
You do not
love me, then?

45:26.800 --> 45:29.929
I pray you, good Mercutio, let's go.
The Capulets are out.

45:31.080 --> 45:33.242
You are like the man
who snatches off his sword,

45:33.400 --> 45:35.528
on a tavern's table,
lays it down forthwith

45:35.680 --> 45:37.409
and vows to have no need of it.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.244
Till, with the second beer,
he takes it up

45:39.400 --> 45:40.845
and runs his host
right through.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.570
Am I like such a fellow?

45:42.760 --> 45:44.091
You know you are
as hot a Jack today

45:44.240 --> 45:45.366
as any to be found in Italy.

45:45.520 --> 45:46.965
Your mood as moody
as a bitch on heat.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.201
Is it so?

45:48.360 --> 45:50.886
Why, you'd quarrel with
a man for cracking nuts,

45:51.040 --> 45:52.530
for the insult given
to your hazel eyes.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.170
I've seen you
quarrel with a man

45:54.320 --> 45:56.322
for coughing in the street
because he woke your dog.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.683
And if I did, I'm still less
quick to find a fight than you.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.682
By heaven,
here come the Capulets.

46:05.840 --> 46:07.001
And do I care?

46:22.400 --> 46:24.641
Wait over here,
and I will speak with them.

46:24.840 --> 46:27.161
Good morrow, gentlemen.
A word with one of you.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.209
A single word
with one of us?

46:29.360 --> 46:32.364
Let's couple it with something.
Maybe a word and a blow?

46:32.560 --> 46:33.846
You'll find me good at that,
Mercutio,

46:34.000 --> 46:35.570
if you'll give me the chance.

46:35.720 --> 46:38.166
Can you not take the chance,
or must it be given?

46:39.280 --> 46:42.887
I've sent a letter writ to Romeo,
whom you consort with.

46:43.040 --> 46:46.010
Consort with?

46:46.160 --> 46:49.209
What? Do you imagine us
a pair of minstrels?

46:49.360 --> 46:51.647
For if you do,
expect the sharpest notes.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.802
Here's my baton that
shall make you dance.

46:53.960 --> 46:54.882
"Consorts," indeed.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.242
Mercutio, Tybalt,
this is a public place.

46:57.400 --> 46:58.925
Either withdraw into
some private place

46:59.080 --> 47:00.206
and there dispute
your grievance,

47:00.360 --> 47:01.725
or else, and better yet,
go home.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.366
Men's eyes were made to look
and let them gaze.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.887
I will not budge
for no man's pleasure, I.

47:12.520 --> 47:14.124
Whoa...

47:15.760 --> 47:17.762
Peace be with you, sir.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.570
- Here comes my man.
- Your man?

47:19.720 --> 47:21.165
I do not see him
in your livery.

47:21.320 --> 47:23.004
How dare you call
a Montague your man!

47:23.160 --> 47:24.924
Benvolio!

47:25.080 --> 47:26.605
- Is something here amiss?
- Romeo!

47:26.760 --> 47:30.481
The hate I bear thee can afford
no better term than this:

47:30.640 --> 47:32.290
Thou art a villain.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.171
Tybalt, the reason
that I have to love thee

47:35.320 --> 47:37.209
does much excuse
the appertaining rage

47:37.360 --> 47:39.362
to such a greeting.

47:39.520 --> 47:40.760
Villain am I none.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.610
Therefore, farewell.
I see you know me not.

47:42.760 --> 47:45.969
Boy! This will not temper
the injuries you have done me.

47:46.120 --> 47:49.169
Therefore, turn and fight.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.807
I do insist I never
injured you, but loved you

47:52.960 --> 47:55.486
better than you'll understand,
till you do know the reason.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.524
So, good Capulet,

47:58.680 --> 48:01.968
a name I love as dearly
as my own, be satisfied.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.930
A smooth, dishonorable,
vile submission!

48:05.640 --> 48:08.211
Tybalt.

48:09.520 --> 48:10.931
You rat catcher.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.366
Will you walk this way?

48:13.400 --> 48:14.606
What do you want from me?

48:14.760 --> 48:17.206
Good king of cats,
just one of your nine lives.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.249
You have it to spare,
with eight to use hereafter.

48:20.440 --> 48:23.649
What, do you dither now
to draw your sword?

48:23.800 --> 48:26.531
Make haste or I will
pluck you ere it's out.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.083
- I am for you.
- No, Mercutio, I beg you,

48:35.240 --> 48:37.083
- put your sword down.
- Come, sir.

48:37.240 --> 48:39.004
Are you ready?
Let's begin.

48:39.160 --> 48:42.369
Mercutio, stop! Benvolio,
help me hold them back!

48:42.560 --> 48:45.530
We must stop! Please!

48:45.680 --> 48:47.603
Mercutio! Tybalt!

48:52.880 --> 48:54.848
Gentlemen, for shame!

48:56.160 --> 48:58.322
Stop this brawl now!

48:58.480 --> 49:00.448
You know the prince
has made his wishes clear:

49:00.600 --> 49:03.604
an end to fighting
in Verona's streets!

49:03.760 --> 49:06.445
Tybalt, good Mercutio, hold!

49:06.600 --> 49:08.841
It is time for peace!

49:21.920 --> 49:23.524
Let's away.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.603
I am dead.

49:25.760 --> 49:28.240
Is Tybalt gone
with no wound to bear?

49:30.520 --> 49:33.126
You, sir, run to my
father's house! Fetch a surgeon!

49:33.960 --> 49:36.042
Tybalt!

49:36.240 --> 49:37.605
Romeo!

49:37.760 --> 49:40.286
Villain! Dog!

49:40.440 --> 49:44.047
If thou art brave,
come settle with me, boy.

49:47.200 --> 49:49.965
Have courage, man.
The wound cannot be much.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.286
No.

49:52.440 --> 49:57.446
'Tis not so deep as a well,
nor so wide as a church door,

49:57.640 --> 49:59.404
but 'tis enough.

50:00.480 --> 50:01.891
'Twill serve.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.809
Ask for me tomorrow, and you
shall find me a grave man.

50:07.720 --> 50:11.725
I am peppered, I warrant,
for this world.

50:13.200 --> 50:14.611
Why the devil came you
between us?

50:14.760 --> 50:15.966
He stabbed me under your arm.

50:16.120 --> 50:17.849
I thought all for the best.

50:20.440 --> 50:24.286
Our best intentions
pave the way to hell.

50:26.720 --> 50:29.644
To hell with the
Montagues and Capulets...

50:30.720 --> 50:34.167
whose angry war
has stolen all my days.

50:36.960 --> 50:40.567
Plague on both your houses.

50:49.600 --> 50:50.886
He's dead.

50:52.720 --> 50:56.441
His gallant spirit
is among the clouds.

51:05.400 --> 51:09.371
Stay here, Benvolio.
Be what help you may.

51:09.520 --> 51:12.603
I have some business
with a new relation.

51:14.520 --> 51:17.330
No! But, Romeo, stay!

51:19.320 --> 51:20.560
Tybalt!

51:22.240 --> 51:24.129
Let him pass.

51:36.520 --> 51:39.888
What, Romeo?
Is it cowardice that holds you back?

52:12.160 --> 52:14.128
Many have died
in this place, Montague.

52:14.280 --> 52:16.442
Befriend their spirits
while you still have time.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.887
They wait to welcome you
with open arms.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.803
They wait for one of us.
That much is sure.

52:40.680 --> 52:42.842
Cousin!

52:43.000 --> 52:44.206
- We're here, Tybalt.
- We're here for you, sir.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.282
Leave us!

52:55.480 --> 52:57.289
No!

52:57.480 --> 52:59.289
My Lord! My Lord?

53:22.280 --> 53:23.566
Romeo, away!

53:23.760 --> 53:25.489
The gods themselves are angry.
Tybalt's killed!

53:25.680 --> 53:28.524
- Tybalt is slain!
- Don't stand there dazed. Go!

53:28.720 --> 53:31.087
The prince will have your head
if you are taken. Go!

53:34.080 --> 53:35.889
Oh, I am fortune's fool.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.486
Romeo, begone.
Away you now!

54:04.280 --> 54:06.760
Tybalt, my nephew.

54:06.920 --> 54:09.161
He was my brother's child.

54:09.320 --> 54:12.688
See how the blood is spilled
of my dear kinsmen.

54:12.840 --> 54:15.127
Prince, as you are true,

54:15.280 --> 54:18.887
for blood of ours,
shed blood of Montague.

54:19.040 --> 54:22.442
Benvolio, who began
this bloody fight?

54:22.600 --> 54:25.490
Tybalt, here slain,
and I was witness how.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.443
Romeo did beg him to desist.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.841
Alas, nothing could stay
the rage of angry Tybalt,

54:31.000 --> 54:32.729
whose ears were deaf to peace.

54:32.880 --> 54:35.281
But what of the second act?

54:35.440 --> 54:37.283
Mercutio lies dead,

54:37.440 --> 54:40.649
and in his grief does
blinded Romeo entertain revenge.

54:40.800 --> 54:43.280
He is a cousin of the Montagues.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.010
Affection makes him false.

54:45.160 --> 54:47.527
Romeo killed Tybalt.

54:47.720 --> 54:49.131
Romeo must not live.

54:49.280 --> 54:52.284
Romeo killed him.
He killed Mercutio.

54:52.440 --> 54:54.886
Who is the guilty man
in all this grief?

54:55.040 --> 54:56.246
Not Romeo, Prince.

54:56.400 --> 54:58.084
He was Mercutio's friend,

54:58.240 --> 54:59.969
and killed his murderer.

55:00.120 --> 55:03.408
The very end the law
would have exacted.

55:10.680 --> 55:14.890
This offense means we do now,
at once, exile him hence.

55:17.720 --> 55:20.724
I will be deaf to
pleading and excuse.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.251
Therefore, use none.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.880
Let Romeo leave in haste.

55:25.040 --> 55:28.567
For if he's found,
that hour will be his last.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.811
Did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?

55:38.080 --> 55:39.923
It did.

55:40.080 --> 55:42.924
I weep to say it, but it did.

55:43.080 --> 55:46.971
And now the prince
has exiled Tybalt's murderer.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.600
- No.
- Shame on your Romeo.

55:49.760 --> 55:51.364
Blister your tongue!

55:51.520 --> 55:53.443
Oh, what a beast
I've been to chide him.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.887
Did Tybalt not first
stab Mercutio?

55:56.080 --> 55:58.811
Will you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?

55:59.000 --> 56:01.810
Shall I speak ill of him
that is my husband?

56:02.000 --> 56:03.445
How stupid I have been to rail,

56:03.600 --> 56:05.602
when now your news of him
is worse than Tybalt's death.

56:05.760 --> 56:07.842
Worse than your cousin's death?

56:08.000 --> 56:12.449
Indeed.
You told me Romeo is banished.

56:12.600 --> 56:15.080
And that one word is greater
grief to me than Father, Mother,

56:15.240 --> 56:17.447
Tybalt and myself
all dead and buried.

56:23.280 --> 56:27.046
Stay in your room,
and I'll find Romeo.

56:27.200 --> 56:30.761
I promise you
a husband for tonight.

56:38.760 --> 56:40.603
Give this ring to my true knight

56:40.760 --> 56:43.445
and bid him come
to take his last farewell.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.326
I will.

56:58.320 --> 57:00.561
What have I done
but murdered my tomorrow?

57:01.640 --> 57:03.529
In killing him whom she
most truly loved,

57:03.680 --> 57:06.251
I have tried and sentenced
my own heart to death.

57:09.240 --> 57:11.322
But if she can pity me
my suffering,

57:11.480 --> 57:14.723
then were it worth
a thousand torments more.

57:15.640 --> 57:18.610
Disasters follow you
like trusty dogs.

57:18.760 --> 57:21.161
You must be
married to calamity.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.607
Tell me the prince's verdict.
Am I to die so young?

57:24.680 --> 57:26.284
Not yet at least.

57:26.440 --> 57:30.161
His judgment has more pity
than you dread.

57:30.320 --> 57:33.802
He seeks to have you
banished and not dead.

57:34.840 --> 57:36.251
Not banishment.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.049
Be merciful, say "death,"

57:39.200 --> 57:41.885
for exile has more terror
in its look, much more than death.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.121
Do not say "banishment."

57:43.280 --> 57:46.523
All he asks is that
you leave Verona.

57:46.680 --> 57:51.129
It's not so much.
The world is broad and wide.

57:51.320 --> 57:53.084
There is no world
beyond the city's walls.

57:53.280 --> 57:56.966
Just purgatory, torture,
hell itself.

57:57.160 --> 57:59.925
And exile is
another word for "death."

58:00.120 --> 58:02.407
The prince's kindness
is a golden axe

58:02.560 --> 58:03.721
that cuts my head off.

58:03.880 --> 58:06.008
Rude, unthankful boy.

58:07.120 --> 58:10.841
The prince, in gentleness,
overturns the law!

58:11.000 --> 58:13.446
This is sweet mercy,
and you see it not!

58:13.600 --> 58:17.047
'Tis torture and not mercy.

58:17.200 --> 58:19.931
Heaven is here,
where Juliet lives,

58:20.080 --> 58:22.162
and every cat and dog

58:22.320 --> 58:24.322
and little mouse,
every unworthy thing,

58:24.520 --> 58:27.205
live here in heaven and may look
on her, but Romeo may not.

58:28.640 --> 58:31.769
More validity,
more honorable state,

58:31.920 --> 58:35.811
more courtship lives
in carrion flies than Romeo.

58:35.960 --> 58:40.249
And they may seize on the white
wonder of dear Juliet's hand.

58:42.120 --> 58:45.010
I mean, flies may do this,
but I from this must fly.

58:45.160 --> 58:46.764
They are free men,
but I am banished.

58:46.960 --> 58:49.201
Cease, Romeo,
in your ingratitude.

58:49.360 --> 58:51.328
You cannot talk
of what you do not feel.

58:51.480 --> 58:54.165
If you were young like me
and full of love,

58:54.320 --> 58:57.290
married an hour,
red with Tybalt's blood,

58:57.440 --> 58:59.124
hungry for Juliet
but banished from her side,

58:59.280 --> 59:00.930
then you could speak
and I would listen.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.843
Where is my lady's lord?

59:05.920 --> 59:07.081
Where is Romeo?

59:08.680 --> 59:12.446
Behold him now,
with his own tears made drunk.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.847
So is my lady Juliet
just the same,

59:19.000 --> 59:20.923
blubbering and weeping,

59:21.080 --> 59:22.320
weeping and blubbering.

59:22.480 --> 59:24.403
Good nurse, you speak
of Juliet?

59:25.320 --> 59:27.448
Say quick: Does she now
think I am a murderer?

59:27.600 --> 59:29.682
She weeps and weeps.

59:30.760 --> 59:32.410
And lies upon her bed, and...

59:32.560 --> 59:36.326
and then jumps up and cries out,
"Tybalt," and then, "Romeo."

59:36.480 --> 59:40.326
My name was fatal to her
from the start.

59:40.480 --> 59:44.405
It kills her, as it killed
her noble kinsman.

59:44.600 --> 59:46.887
Oh, tell me in what part of
my anatomy does lodge my name,

59:47.040 --> 59:49.247
- and I will hack it off!
- What?

59:50.440 --> 59:53.171
Wouldst kill yourself
and all the lady's hopes?

59:54.400 --> 59:56.209
Look to your wits!

59:57.760 --> 59:59.444
Your Juliet is alive.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.967
There you are happy.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.367
Tybalt would kill you,
but you instead killed Tybalt.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.521
Take heart.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.805
The prince has altered death
to simple exile.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.241
Another stroke of luck
to make you smile.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.687
Have done with pouting.
Go to your love.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.850
Climb to her chamber,
kiss and comfort her!

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.722
But leave before the watch
begins to walk,

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.564
to make the journey
safe to Mantua,

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.724
where you will live
till we can find a way

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.167
to blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends,

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.846
beg pardon of the prince
and call you back.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.450
Oh, what it is to
hear good counsel.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.568
You must return
to my lady Juliet.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.767
Say Romeo is coming.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.321
My Lord,
I'll tell my lady you will come.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.164
Say I am prepared
to be chastised.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.050
Here, sir,
a ring she did bid me give you.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.407
How well my comfort
is revived by this.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.524
Be sure
you leave before the dawn.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.087
Then make your home
in Mantua and wait.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.161
I will send you messages
with all our news.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.690
If I were not
to gain a joy past joy,

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.126
I would be sad to leave you.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.001
So farewell.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.364
Why the race
to drag her to the church?

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.922
Give her time to mourn her cousin.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.768
No. We have no time
to waste in sterile tears,

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.764
with Paris restive in the slips
and soon to be rid of her

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.445
if he be not
persuaded she is his.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.324
I do not think he
is so changeable.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.602
Let us not take a chance
with lovers' vows

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.842
when Jove does laugh
at their fragility.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.163
Do you want legal offspring
from our loins?

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.091
With Tybalt dead
and all our line at risk,

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.850
young Juliet is the
only living course

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.206
through which our blood can flow.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.647
You know I do.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.849
Well, then we shall
take action when we may

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.327
and strike while the iron is hot.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.811
This way, sir.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.647
Paris, welcome.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.161
How does my lady
in this sorrowful hour?

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.721
I would that I might be
some comfort to her.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.044
Tonight, she is imprisoned
in her grief,

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.771
but in the morning,
I will know her mind.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.003
Wife... when dawn breaks,

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.288
bid her make ready
for her wedding day.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.724
You will tell her on Thursday
she will wed the noble count.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.326
What say you to Thursday?

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.721
My Lord, I wish Thursday
were tomorrow.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.921
Thursday it is, then.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.724
<i>Come, gentle night.</i>

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.848
<i>Come loving,
black-brewed night.</i>

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.010
<i>Give me my Romeo,
and when he shall die,</i>

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.721
<i>take him and cut him out
in little stars.</i>

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.366
<i>He will make the face
of Heaven so fine</i>

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.887
<i>that all the world will be
in love with night</i>

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.611
<i>and pay no worship
to the garish sun.</i>

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.403
My husband.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.126
My wife.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.564
Must you be gone?

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.929
It's nowhere near the dawn.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.964
You heard the nightingale
and not a lark, I promise.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.044
She sings each night
sitting in yonder tree.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.323
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.087
It was the lark,
the herald of the morn.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.049
No nightingale.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.806
Look, love,

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.327
what envious streaks do lace
the severing clouds

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.045
in yonder east.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.891
Night's candles are burnt out,

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.567
and jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountain tops.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.403
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.769
I do not think the light
is daylight yet.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.286
I am content
if you would have it so.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.240
I have more heart to stay
than will to go.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.802
Come, death, and welcome.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.450
Juliet wills it so.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.769
I will lie with you
and say it is not day.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.731
It is. It is. Go now.
Begone. Away!

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.484
Oh, it is the lark
that sings so out of tune

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.847
with horrid discords
and unpleasant sharps.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.207
Oh, hurry now.
More light and light it grows!

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.801
More light and light,
more dark and dark our woes.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.285
- Madam!
- What is it?

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.761
Your mother is soon coming
to your chamber.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.730
The day is here.
Be careful and make haste.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.360
I shall be gone.
Your parents cannot know

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.000
that I have been part
of this deceit.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.366
Farewell, my love.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.329
One more kiss,
and I'll descend.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.528
No. Come this way.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.167
I'll teach Benvolio to learn
your news each day.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.687
No, more than that.
Each hour in each day.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.002
Each minute in each hour
is a day for pining lovers.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.605
And amen to that.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.531
Do you believe
we'll ever meet again?

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.807
I do not doubt it.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.362
Nor that we shall smile to think
of all these troubles in the past.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.649
If God would only
free me of foreboding.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.644
I think I see you,
now you are below,

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.962
as dim and pale
as dead men in their tombs.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.327
So are you dim, love,
in dawn's drab light.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.046
Our worries make us pale.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.410
So adieu.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.121
Oh, fortune, fortune,

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:41.285
all men call you fickle because
no fortune ever constant be.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.006
If that is so,
then change again, oh, fortune.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.249
Be fickle now
and send him back to me.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.804
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.127
Please, Benvolio,
be a guardian angel to my love.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.323
Watch her firmly and gently
as it would do the eye of God.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.091
I will. I promise you.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.129
Farewell, cousin.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.929
What is the rush?

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.809
I pray you tell, My Lord,
I will not marry yet,

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.327
and when I do, I swear
it shall be Romeo, whom I hate,

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.165
rather than Paris,
whom I despise!

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.124
Here comes your father.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.486
You can tell him so yourself.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.646
My girl is like a channel.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.802
What, more tears?

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.327
The level of the sea
will start to lift

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.966
if much more water flows
from your sweet eyes.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.331
Wife, have you told her
of her marriage plans?

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:06.690
I have, and she will have
none of it, I swear.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.367
Soft. Soft.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.364
Take me with you,
take me with you, wife.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.205
How? Will she none?

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.210
Does she not give us thanks?

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.964
Is she not proud?

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.363
Does she not think her blessed,
unworthy as she is,

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.761
that we have brought so worthy
a gentleman to be her groom?

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.400
Thankful I am,
and grateful for your love,

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.164
but proud I cannot be
of what I hate.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.164
How... how-how-how,
chopped logic.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.651
What is this?

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.565
"Proud" and "I thank you,"
but "I thank you not."

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.087
Thank me no thankings,
nor proud me no prouds!

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.005
Be ready, lady,
Thursday morning next,

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.367
to go with Paris
to St. Peter's Church

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.602
- or I will drag thee thither on a rail!
- Are you mad?

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.967
Good father,
I beseech you on my knees.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.209
Will you not give me leave
to plead my cause?

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.443
You...

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.762
I tell you what.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.566
Be there, Thursday church,

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.960
or never after look me
in the face.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.645
- I...
- Speak not.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.888
Reply not, do not answer me.
My fingers itch!

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.249
My lord, you're in the wrong,
my lord, to punish her.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.368
Is that my lady wisdom's view?
Take care.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.961
You dice with your place
in talking thus.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.406
May not one speak?

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.250
Oh, will you be quiet,
you fool!

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.489
- Now...
- No, husband, you are too hot.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.362
God's blood,
it does make me mad!

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.560
Day, night, month, year!

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.844
My constant care...

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.447
has been to have my only
child worthily matched.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.290
And here I find an educated man

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.808
of equal birth
with honorable parts,

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.611
with fine estates
and handsome to behold,

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.450
and what is my reward?

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.446
A puking fool, who answers,
"I'll not wed. I cannot love.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.120
I am too young.
I pray you pardon me."

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.806
Now think on this.
Thursday is near.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.086
If you will play the bride,

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.844
then are you my daughter
and all is forgot.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.890
If you will not,
then you are mine no more.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.647
Graze where you will.
You shall not house with me.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.684
Beg, starve or hang,

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.649
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.565
nor pass to you
the slightest thing that's mine.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:27.567
I swear to this, my word,
so help me God!

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.288
How can Father speak so
to a child

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.886
who loves him better
than she loves herself?

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.526
Oh, oh, God.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.162
Oh, Nurse,
how shall this be prevented?

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.085
I have a living husband
here on earth.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.447
What, should I take
a second in a lie

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.206
and cast myself forever into hell?

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.250
Well, here it is.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.243
Romeo is...

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.124
gone, and cannot come back,

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.169
except in stealth
at risk to life and limb.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.524
Given that case,
which will not alter soon...

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.731
I think it best
you marry with the count.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.124
Speakest thou from thy heart?

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.729
And from my soul.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.043
Or the devil take us all.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.481
Amen.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.282
Oh, Juliet,
I understand your grief.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.728
I strive and strain
to think howl may help.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.848
I know your father's
will is absolute

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.042
that Thursday next
you marry with the count.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.806
Why talk of what must
be which cannot be?

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.131
If you have no solution
to my plight,

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.964
then this knife
shall be my deliverer.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.963
Ah, Jesu Maria.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.201
God joined our hearts in bliss,
you joined our hands,

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.567
and death is better
than the ruin of all.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.961
So bless this blade,
unless you have a remedy,

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.407
and I'll exchange
my honor for my life.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.326
Daughter...

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.363
I do spy a kind of hope,

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.491
but it requires
a desperate execution.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.362
You have the strength of will to kill
yourself rather than marry Paris.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.727
Very well.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.009
You'll need that strength,

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.844
and I do know a way.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.483
Rather then marry Paris,
I would jump

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.246
from off the battlements
of yonder tower.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.920
Spend the long, dark night
walled in a tomb,

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.128
with rotting limbs
and hollow, grinning skulls.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.920
Or order me to lie
in a fresh grave,

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.731
and hide myself
inside the corpse's shroud.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.484
Things most hideous
will I gladly do

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.881
to keep myself unscarred
for Romeo's love.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.004
Then go home, be merry...

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.405
and agree to marry Paris.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.081
Oh, I am in earnest, Juliet.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.530
For I have knowledge
to concoct a mix

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.122
that will unlock you
from your present cell.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.727
If you but find the nerve
to swallow it.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.404
Tomorrow's Thursday.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.360
Now tonight,
make sure you sleep alone.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.241
And send your prying nurse
out of the room.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.962
Lie down upon your bed,
then take this phial...

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.643
and drink the clouded juice
to the last drop.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.441
<i>Soon, soft drowsiness
will close your eyes.</i>

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.845
<i>Your pulse will cease,</i>

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.971
<i>and there will be
no sign of life within you.</i>

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.485
<i>Neither warmth, nor breath,</i>

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.928
<i>nor roses in your cheeks
nor on your lips,</i>

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.961
<i>but stiff and stark
and every sign of death.</i>

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.890
<i>And in this borrowed likeness
of a corpse,</i>

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:31.328
<i>you will continue
for six and 20 hours,</i>

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.609
and then awake
as from a pleasant dream.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.450
So Paris, on his wedding morn,

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.207
will come to find his bride
is dead and ripe for burial

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.880
in the great vault
where Capulets do lie.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.285
<i>While I will write
with news to Romeo.</i>

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.243
<i>He and I will be there</i>

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.971
<i>when he will wake you
with a kiss.</i>

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.685
And he will carry you
to some far distant place,

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.004
where all your anguish
shall become pure joy.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.920
Give me the phial
and talk no more of fear.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.930
Then go.
At dawn tomorrow,

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.566
a novice will set out for Mantua
with letters for your lord.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.087
Farewell, dear Friar.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.331
And now, love...

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.451
give me strength.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.207
You said it was
a modest group of friends.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.930
And so it will be.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.366
Peter, what's the news?

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.888
Well, we've hired ten cooks
and 20 serving men.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.771
A quiet marriage leads
to speculation.

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:07.051
My daughter has the virtue of
a saint, and I would rather none

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.601
had leave to doubt.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.205
Come here, Nurse.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.727
My lord?

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.769
Is Juliet gone to
Friar Laurence's cell?

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.163
She is, to make confession
of her sins.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.042
Well, let's hope he may have
found some good in her.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.681
She's here.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.129
And merrier than
when she left.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:33.841
And where have you been,
my headstrong gadabout?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.729
The holy friar sends
me home to kneel

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.450
and ask forgiveness
for my mutiny.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.125
Pardon me, dear Father,
I beseech you.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.806
Henceforward,
I will live beneath your rule.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.846
Well said, my daughter.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.607
If you should find Romeo
in morbid grief or feverish,

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.410
these herbs will make him well.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.006
Be sure he's strong
to take the journey home.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.049
But do not fear.
My letter will revive him.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.282
Give me your blessing,
and I will be gone.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.328
God speed your path
and keep you safe from harm.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.041
Nurse, here is the key
to fetch more spices.

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:38.403
The cook wants dates
and quinces for the pies.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.006
We must a-move on.
Paris will be here.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.447
Get anything we need,
spare not the cost.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.046
My lady and my lord,
get you some rest

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.690
or you will not survive
the wedding feast.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.962
What nonsense!
I've been up all night before

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.849
for lesser cause than this.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.729
And I know why.

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:56.929
And look to have
no repetition now.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.811
A wife still jealous
after all these years?

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.804
Why, 'tis compliment
enough to give me cheer.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.281
Hmm? Hmm?

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.004
Wife!

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.248
Nurse!

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:23.041
- Will nobody obey me?!
- Oh, peace, peace!

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.044
Go waken Juliet.
Dress her and trim her.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.361
Pray, bring her down

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.251
to compliment the
bridegroom in his choice.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.401
Hmm.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.045
Mistress.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.565
My Juliet?

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.801
Oh, still fast asleep?

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.091
Come, lady. Come, lamb.
It's time to wake.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.725
Well, you'll profit
from a few hours dreams.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.210
Tonight, Count Paris
will have other plans.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.285
But if your marriage
will not let you rest,

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.329
just wait ten years.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.131
You'll sleep all you want.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.724
Heavens, how sound you slumber.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.730
I must needs wake you.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.241
Lady.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.885
Lady!

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.762
Oh, no!

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.681
Come, is my bride ready
to go to church?

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.161
Ready to go,
but never to return.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.445
My son...

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.130
the night before
your wedding day,

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.442
your wife was stolen from you.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.641
What?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.445
Are you saying she is dead?

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.249
Flower as she was...

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.643
Death is now my heir.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.842
My daughter he has married.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.723
I will die and leave him all.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:34.883
Life, living, all is Death's.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.566
This day had promised
all my happiness...

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.646
and now it shows me
such a sight as this?

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.646
Accursed, unhappy,
wretched, hateful day!

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.325
The worst that ever dawned.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.207
Most woeful day. Never was
so black a day as this.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.006
I am divorced...

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.566
wronged...

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.609
hated...

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.809
killed by Death,
but Death is my future.

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.122
He holds all I love.

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.525
Death that has killed
my daughter,

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.008
ties my tongue
and drains my eyes

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.322
and will not let me grieve.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.888
Oh, child.
My soul more than my child.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.725
Dead are you now.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.167
Alack. My child is dead...

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.407
and with my child,
all my joys are buried.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:48.530
Oh, come, sir, for shame.

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:55.802
And think of her poor soul,
freed now from care

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.685
and safe in heaven's bliss.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.449
Give up your grief and bring
sweet-smelling flowers

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.683
to lay upon her corpse
with gentle tears.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.684
Then take her to church,

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.526
where she may sleep
among her kin for all eternity.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.442
The plans we made
for joyful celebration

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.286
must turn instead
to mark our sorrowing woe.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.889
Our merry hymns
to sullen dirges change.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.360
Sir, madam,
make ready for our march,

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.922
to take this lovely child
to her grave.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.364
We cannot know why
it is heaven's will.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.807
But we must trust in him
who orders all.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.126
Stop! I beseech you, sir.
In heaven's name.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.800
Say now, are you
a holy man of God?

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.611
I am a novice,
but I serve God, yes.

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.001
Have you made study
in the art of herbs?

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.283
- I have.
- My son is sick.

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.090
I have an errand
to perform in Mantua.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.288
- By when?
- Before tonight.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.411
Mantua is but two leagues away.
I'll take you there myself.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.484
Then show me your child.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.160
Will there be
anything else, sir?

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.651
No, thank you, Jack.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.211
- Cousin.
- Benvolio!

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.486
Welcome.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.929
And with Verona's news?

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.083
I do bring news.
It's true.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.968
Then spit it out.
How does my lady?

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.929
Is my father well?

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.761
How does my Juliet?

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.088
See, I ask it twice.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.289
Then I must answer once...

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.604
to say the worst.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.324
Her body sleeps
among the Capulets...

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.723
in the great monument
that marks their fame.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.361
Juliet is dead?

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.610
Only her mortal part.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.803
Her soul lives on
in heaven's blessed care.

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.122
You know this
or you heard a story told?

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.408
I saw her laid inside
her kindred's vault.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.763
That done, I came as quick as
I could find a horse to bring me.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:22.721
Pardon me, cousin...

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.045
that I come with
a tale so full of grief.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.531
And it is so?

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.841
Then I must hurry.
Jack!

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.570
I beg you give
yourself some time.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.324
You must be riven
with a savage grief

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.323
and need a while to calm
your raging thoughts.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.687
Cousin, you're deceived.
I know my mind.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.285
Are there no letters to me
from the friar?

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.930
No, my good lord.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.725
No matter.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.451
Go with Jack.

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.880
Get fresh water for your horse.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.929
I'll meet you
by the city gates.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.250
Go.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.206
Well, Juliet...

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.003
I will lie with you tonight.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.926
As to the means,
I will not wonder long.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:43.089
I do remember an apothecary
who lives not far from here...

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.284
if it is life...

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.570
where there is neither gold...

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.849
nor food...

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.285
nor rest.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.006
Hey, there!

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.284
Apothecary!

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.442
Who calls so loud?

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.845
Come over here.

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.770
I see that you're poor.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.605
There is no crime in that.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.649
Nor pleasure, neither.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.802
Now, listen,
I seek a kind of poison

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.531
so powerful that swallowed
in one dram,

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.170
it stops a man and
drops him in his tracks

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.850
before he may but mark
the consequence.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.925
If this be murder,
the answer's no.

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:42.651
The victim's one I
have right to kill.

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.727
I have such mortal drugs.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.090
But Mantua's law brings death
to any man who issues them.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:56.084
Are you so thin and full of
wretchedness, yet scared to die?

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.925
Famine is in your cheeks.
The world is not your friend.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.287
You will not find that cherishing
the law makes you rich,

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:05.889
be not poor,
and break the law for this.

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:14.121
My poverty,
not my will, consents.

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.851
I pay your poverty
and not your will.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.168
I'm looking for Lord Romeo.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.765
He is gone.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.206
Gone?

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:50.649
And in great haste.
Back to Verona.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.928
What purpose had you with him?

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.889
Nothing now.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.361
You've had a wasted journey.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.170
Who can say?

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.682
I saved a child,
but failed in my delivery.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.205
God's ways are hard
for us to penetrate.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.129
Benvolio, you can come no further.

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.089
Now take this letter
early in the morn

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:49.328
and see you deliver it
to my lord and father.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.927
Farewell, Benvolio.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.407
Let us say good night.

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:02.801
No.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.928
But... but why descend
into this bed of death?

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.687
Partly, I must behold
my lady's face.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.128
Chiefly, I'd return this
precious ring to her fair hand

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.611
which gave it me.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.045
And now be gone.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.162
I go, and do not seek
to question you.

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:34.766
By which you show your love.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.171
Goodbye, dear friend.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.490
Banished Romeo Montague,

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.530
who murdered Juliet's cousin,
noble Tybalt...

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.283
causing her the grief
that took her to the grave.

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.330
And now he comes
to desecrate the dead.

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.690
Leave them to heaven
and attend to me.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.647
We needs must fight,
for you are bound to die.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.447
The very reason
why you find me here.

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:36.405
I am Count Paris,

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:40.525
and I here defend the grave of she
who should have been my bride.

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:44.002
Oh, good, gentle youth,
tempt not a desperate man.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.566
Put not another sin upon my head
by urging me to fury.

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:51.122
Oh, fly hence.
Be gone, survive.

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.209
What?

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:56.648
Should I buy this proof
of your concern?

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.167
Or is a Montague afraid to fight?

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.680
May God bless you, Paris.

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.560
Friar! Friar Laurence!

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.244
- Friar Laurence!
- Who's there?

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:05.804
Benvolio? What brings you
here to me at dead of night?

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.450
My care for one you love.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.046
The good lord Romeo,
he waits by Juliet's tomb,

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.770
all full of woe.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.129
Why talk of woe?
Say rather joy.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.926
How joy, when all his love
and life are in the grave?

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.285
Did he not receive my letter?

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.569
What letter's that?

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:50.164
Is that you, Tybalt,
in that mortal sleep?

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.966
Forgive me, cousin,
for the harm I did.

01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.609
There is no reparation
more than this,

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.286
that I shall kill the man
who once killed you.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.090
Leaving this sweet corpse
is trial enough.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.241
Oh, my love.

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.925
My wife.

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.886
It is time to join you
in all eternity.

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.323
Juliet, why are
you still so fair?

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.925
Death that has sucked
the honey of your breath

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.970
has had no power as yet
to spoil your beauty.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.526
Shall I believe he
has a plan in this?

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.364
That insubstantial Death
is amorous,

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.648
keeping you perfect
for his paramour?

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.848
For fear of that,
I will still stay with thee.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.529
And never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.850
Eyes... look your last.

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.326
Arms... take your last embrace.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.721
And lips...
the doors of breath,

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.605
be forever sealed
with a righteous kiss.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.724
Come, bitter conduct.

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:48.130
Come, unsavory guide.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.851
Here's to my love.

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.811
Oh, true apothecary,
thy drugs are quick.

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.403
Juliet.

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:31.725
Romeo.

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.922
Oh, no.

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.965
Thus, with a kiss, I die.

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:11.004
No. No.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:17.647
No.

01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:34.961
Oh, no.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.564
Oh, no.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.004
So pale?

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.840
My best beloved
husband lies here dead.

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.970
Not Romeo.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.003
My child.

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.002
Not him of all.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.846
Oh, what unkind hour
has brought to pass

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.411
this miserable deed.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:15.325
Alas, my lady,
we are overturned.

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:17.050
No.

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.283
A greater power
than we can contradict

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.050
has thwarted all our plans.

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:28.931
Come away from death,
contagion and unnatural sleep.

01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.401
Leaving my husband
to face this alone?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.206
The watchman.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.646
My lady, come away.

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.091
Unkind!

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:44.005
To drink it all and leave
no drop so I could follow after.

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.605
Nay, good my lady.

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.371
Listen now and come.

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.727
I will hide you
in a sisterhood of nuns.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.087
Stop, stop,
not to question why.

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.971
- We must away.
- You go.

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.009
I must bid farewell to Romeo.

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:07.083
Stay then,
until you are at peace.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:10.528
But linger not.
I'll hold back the watchman.

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.811
I'd kiss my love
for one last time.

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:18.361
Then follow you at once.

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:23.566
Do not be late.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.402
Who's there?

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.289
Who's there? Who's within?

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.527
Just one kiss,

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.889
in case some venom
lingers on your lips.

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:55.964
Your mouth is warm.

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:08.884
I will explain.

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.202
The boy has come here
at my bidding.

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.010
Somebody's coming.

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:19.330
Then I'll be brief.

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.284
Oh, happy dagger.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.644
This is thy sheath.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:49.290
There rust...

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.331
and let me die.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.685
Patience now.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.285
We should not disturb
this holy quiet.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.802
- Show me the way!
- Very well, very well.

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:11.531
If you insist.

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.449
We know now
how this sorrow came about,

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:55.365
and pardon all the players
in their end.

01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:00.446
Their own forbidden love
did murder them.

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.323
Yet can we take a lesson
from their deaths.

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:11.130
Capulet, Montague.

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:21.484
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate,

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:26.561
that heaven finds means
to kill your joy with love.

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.324
Oh, dearest Montague.

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:38.481
Give me your hand.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.610
<i>The sun, for sorrow,
will not show his head.</i>

01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.810
<i>And join with all in
grieving for the dead.</i>

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.568
<i>For never was a story
of more woe than this,</i>

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:33.203
<i>of Juliet and her Romeo.</i>
