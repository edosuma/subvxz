00:41.667 --> 00:43.668
<i>Before you were born,</i>

00:43.670 --> 00:47.538
<i>Amsterdam was captivated
by a flower.</i>

00:47.540 --> 00:50.274
<i>The tulip.</i>

00:50.276 --> 00:53.277
<i>They came from far away,
in the East,</i>

00:53.279 --> 00:55.411
<i>and were so rare and beautiful,</i>

00:55.413 --> 00:59.583
<i>for people lost their senses
in wanting to own them.</i>

00:59.585 --> 01:03.787
<i>Rich and poor were spending
and borrowing money</i>

01:03.789 --> 01:05.723
<i>to join the trade in bulbs,</i>

01:05.725 --> 01:09.527
<i>which were going up in price
all the time.</i>

01:09.529 --> 01:14.198
<i>None more so
than the rare striped tulips</i>

01:14.200 --> 01:16.467
<i>that were called breakers.</i>

01:18.738 --> 01:20.738
<i>A new breaker
came from nowhere,</i>

01:20.740 --> 01:24.676
<i>like an act of God,
and it changed people's lives.</i>

01:24.678 --> 01:29.279
<i>A white flower
with a God-given crimson stripe</i>

01:29.281 --> 01:32.348
<i>turned our lives upside down,</i>

01:32.350 --> 01:36.688
<i>mine and my mistress Sophia's.</i>

02:01.246 --> 02:03.247
Sophia!

02:08.687 --> 02:10.822
It's time to go!

02:10.824 --> 02:13.024
The abbess is calling!

02:13.026 --> 02:15.994
<i>But that was all to come
when Sophia exchanged her life</i>

02:15.996 --> 02:20.332
<i>at St. Ursula's for marriage
to Cornelis Sandvoort.</i>

02:21.767 --> 02:23.366
is a safe harbor.

02:23.368 --> 02:26.503
And you will have a fine house,
a servant,

02:26.505 --> 02:28.506
and you will have children.

02:28.508 --> 02:32.509
Give him an heir,
and everything will be fine.

02:32.511 --> 02:37.447
So, love, honor and obey.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.783
It's for the best.

02:50.696 --> 02:53.897
<i>In return
for Sophia's sacrifice,</i>

02:53.899 --> 02:57.300
<i>her siblings received
safe passage to New Amsterdam</i>

02:57.302 --> 02:58.970
<i>in the Americas</i>

02:58.972 --> 03:02.339
<i>to stay with their only living
relative, an aunt.</i>

03:02.341 --> 03:04.277
Whoa.

03:17.089 --> 03:20.692
<i>And so Sophia arrived
at the orphanage barefoot</i>

03:20.694 --> 03:24.360
<i>but left in a carriage.</i>

03:24.362 --> 03:27.031
Go on. Hyah!

03:38.577 --> 03:40.777
Don't let...
don't let the chickens out!

03:40.779 --> 03:43.114
Don't let the chickens out! No!

03:43.116 --> 03:44.848
No, come on!

04:20.152 --> 04:24.421
A man likes to leave something
of himself behind.

04:24.423 --> 04:30.030
A son to inherit my name
and fortune.

04:32.499 --> 04:35.565
My little soldier's dozy
tonight.

04:35.567 --> 04:38.502
Time to report for duty, sir.

04:38.504 --> 04:41.004
Give me your hand.

04:41.006 --> 04:44.007
There.

04:44.009 --> 04:46.946
Stand to attention, sir.

04:51.917 --> 04:55.719
- Cornelis. Meet my son and heir.

04:55.721 --> 04:58.991
- Congratulations.

05:00.793 --> 05:03.927
So you and your wife
didn't waste much time.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.863
I hear your wife's
been wasting yours.

05:07.066 --> 05:08.899
Well, not for lack of trying.

05:08.901 --> 05:10.101
That orphan girl,

05:10.103 --> 05:11.968
send her back then.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.038
You've tried enough.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.706
I'll give her six months.

05:15.708 --> 05:17.774
It's best if I give her up
after that.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.043
Which reminds me,
that woman in Utrecht,

05:20.045 --> 05:21.711
she keeps asking about you.

05:21.713 --> 05:23.714
Sh-She does? What does she say?

05:23.716 --> 05:25.785
Ha. She wants to know
when you'll be back.

05:37.864 --> 05:41.731
Just a touch of bright plumage
in the detail.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.232
A woman who's been married
three years needs

05:43.234 --> 05:45.937
to keep herself... interesting.

05:45.939 --> 05:48.107
Or life will become dulled.

05:53.112 --> 05:55.812
- Do you know who she is?
- Of course.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.915
She's DanaÃ«
being made love to by Zeus.

05:58.917 --> 06:02.086
That's Antonia Hocken,
the tinsmith's wife.

06:02.088 --> 06:04.956
She could tell you a thing
or two about him with the brush.

06:04.958 --> 06:07.124
- Really?
- Is that true?

06:07.126 --> 06:09.093
- And as for your dress,

06:09.095 --> 06:10.093
it'll be ready in a week.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.531
Thank you, Mrs. Overvalt.

06:17.268 --> 06:20.805
Nutmegs. Straight off the boat.

06:20.807 --> 06:23.074
They want 200 a keg.
Have a sniff.

06:24.944 --> 06:27.577
Quality is good. But, look,

06:27.579 --> 06:30.915
they've added shells
to make the barrels heavier.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.821
Banda Islanders up
to their tricks.

06:35.622 --> 06:38.855
Offer 85.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.591
I want every one
of those barrels,

06:40.593 --> 06:41.925
when they're on the quayside,

06:41.927 --> 06:44.193
I want them opened
and inspected!

06:44.195 --> 06:46.997
<i>These were happy times for me,</i>

06:46.999 --> 06:49.800
<i>and I would not have changed
places with Sophia.</i>

06:49.802 --> 06:51.968
<i>She treated me like a sister,</i>

06:51.970 --> 06:54.572
<i>while my master
rarely took notice of me.</i>

06:54.574 --> 06:56.040
Fish again, Maria?

06:56.042 --> 06:57.742
We'll be sprouting fins.

06:57.744 --> 06:59.810
But you always like herring done
in this way, sir,

06:59.812 --> 07:01.112
in sweet vinegar.

07:01.114 --> 07:02.846
But fish three times this week?

07:02.848 --> 07:06.716
And several times last week,
now I recall.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.152
Why? Are you in love
with the fishmonger?

07:22.869 --> 07:25.603
Will I come tomorrow?

07:25.605 --> 07:28.304
Yes.

07:28.306 --> 07:31.308
Only if you love me.

07:31.310 --> 07:34.247
I love you, Maria.

07:45.157 --> 07:47.157
Thank you.

07:47.159 --> 07:49.026
- Bye.
- Bye. Willem,

07:49.028 --> 07:50.594
go.

07:50.596 --> 07:51.928
Go.

08:05.812 --> 08:10.615
I think my little soldier's
ready tonight.

08:10.617 --> 08:13.886
Please, the candle.

08:33.672 --> 08:36.139
- Shh!

08:36.140 --> 08:38.674
Shh.

08:38.677 --> 08:40.614
Shh!

09:02.969 --> 09:05.902
I have to get something
from the apothecary.

09:05.904 --> 09:07.370
Do you have the purse?

09:07.372 --> 09:09.707
Ask him for something
to lift your spirits.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.307
I should ask you.

09:11.309 --> 09:13.376
What do you take
to make you so cheery?

09:13.378 --> 09:15.444
He doesn't keep it, madam.

09:43.810 --> 09:46.376
Is this the house of Dr. Sorgh?

09:46.378 --> 09:48.978
Sorgh himself at your service.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.179
Will you come in?

09:51.783 --> 09:53.950
Mm.

09:53.952 --> 09:55.285
Do you know Mrs. Overvalt?

09:55.287 --> 09:56.753
She's my dressmaker.

09:56.755 --> 09:58.154
Uh, I know her, yes.

09:58.156 --> 10:00.222
She said you were a doctor of...

10:00.224 --> 10:02.859
of female mysteries.

10:02.861 --> 10:04.762
You may speak
in complete confidence.

10:04.764 --> 10:06.097
It's difficult for me.

10:06.099 --> 10:08.264
Well, let me help you.
How late is it?

10:08.266 --> 10:10.937
How late is what?

10:15.206 --> 10:17.207
No.

10:17.209 --> 10:19.241
What did Mrs. Overvalt tell you?

10:19.243 --> 10:21.410
She said you would help me
to conceive.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.213
To give my husband a child.

10:23.215 --> 10:25.983
Oh, yes. Mrs. Overvalt.

10:25.985 --> 10:27.150
Yes.

10:27.152 --> 10:31.187
Now I remember her. Mm.

10:31.189 --> 10:34.858
My husband made two babies
with his first wife.

10:34.860 --> 10:36.526
God took them, all three.

10:36.528 --> 10:39.997
Years ago. Many years ago.

10:39.999 --> 10:43.165
Cornelis is old,
but he's very... willing.

10:43.167 --> 10:45.334
- Mm. Mm.
- Still, he saved me

10:45.336 --> 10:47.872
from a life of poverty,
and I must repay him.

10:47.874 --> 10:49.540
He wants a son.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.541
And I have not been blessed.

10:51.543 --> 10:53.175
Mrs. Overvalt said
you can help me.

10:53.177 --> 10:55.115
Of course.

10:58.084 --> 11:00.785
This way.

11:04.123 --> 11:06.457
- Thank you.
- There's the bed.

11:06.459 --> 11:09.324
Um, on your back
or your front... up to you.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.864
A thousand apologies!

11:14.866 --> 11:16.399
How dare you!

11:29.281 --> 11:32.816
...see that ye love one another

11:32.818 --> 11:37.555
with a pure heart fervently:

11:37.557 --> 11:40.356
being born again,
not of corruptible seed,

11:40.358 --> 11:41.891
but of incorruptible,

11:41.893 --> 11:44.227
by the word of God,

11:44.229 --> 11:47.565
which liveth
and abideth for ever.

11:47.567 --> 11:49.566
For all flesh is grass,

11:49.568 --> 11:54.604
and all the glory of man
as the flower of grass...

11:57.441 --> 11:59.208
Nice pig heads!

11:59.210 --> 12:02.478
Um, I'll take four chops
and a hen, for a guilder.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.881
Four chops.

12:03.883 --> 12:05.414
Cheer up, Simon.

12:07.919 --> 12:10.153
- Thank you very much.

12:10.155 --> 12:12.288
<i>The blessings of thy bounty,</i>

12:12.290 --> 12:14.491
in good times and bad,
now and for ever,

12:14.493 --> 12:18.996
may thy servants
be truly thankful. Amen.

12:18.998 --> 12:20.431
Amen.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.313
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:43.121 --> 12:45.188
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:50.295 --> 12:51.929
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:53.599 --> 12:57.236
I've decided to engage
the services of a painter.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.171
A portrait painter.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.878
And so I've hired Mattheus.

13:07.378 --> 13:10.145
He's been hard at work
scouring the art world

13:10.147 --> 13:12.250
- for a suitable candidate.

13:24.296 --> 13:28.397
- I'll see you tonight at tavern.

13:28.399 --> 13:30.667
I need a couple of whores
tomorrow... bring a friend.

13:30.669 --> 13:31.669
I'm doing a tavern scene.

13:31.671 --> 13:33.970
Doing the innkeeper's daughter
for Paul Nassau.

13:33.972 --> 13:37.007
Nassau can't paint tavern
scenes to save his life!

13:37.009 --> 13:38.373
<i>He's found an artist.</i>

13:38.375 --> 13:40.242
<i>I'm assured he's sober,</i>

13:40.244 --> 13:41.679
- <i>industrious and respectable.</i>
- Jan!

13:41.681 --> 13:45.648
- Jan!
- <i>His name is Jan Van Loos.</i>

13:45.650 --> 13:46.983
<i>He's one of the most promising</i>

13:46.985 --> 13:49.419
young artists in Amsterdam.

13:49.421 --> 13:51.386
So his price
is still reasonable.

13:51.388 --> 13:54.189
My skating scene.

13:54.191 --> 13:55.324
Hmm.

13:55.326 --> 13:56.727
<i>The Raising of Lazarus.</i>

13:56.729 --> 13:58.296
I'm the blind beggar.

14:00.431 --> 14:02.532
<i>The Drunkard's Downward Path.</i>

14:02.534 --> 14:04.701
Thank you
for showing me your work.

14:04.703 --> 14:06.605
They're good,
but they lack obsession.

14:08.106 --> 14:10.173
You will make a handsome...

14:10.175 --> 14:11.511
You think there's vanity in it?

14:13.578 --> 14:14.678
Well, there is some.

14:14.680 --> 14:18.015
And when everything else
about me has been forgotten,

14:18.017 --> 14:21.617
they'll say, "Look there
at that lucky old dog.

14:21.619 --> 14:24.255
Didn't he have
a lovely young wife?"

14:25.591 --> 14:27.657
Yeah.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.126
A double portrait,

14:29.128 --> 14:31.263
Cornelis Sandvoort
and his wife, Sophia.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.199
Obsession.

14:37.201 --> 14:39.368
- God, was I sozzled.
- Jan, listen,

14:39.370 --> 14:41.371
I got you a commission.

14:41.373 --> 14:44.040
Double portrait,
Cornelis Sandvoort

14:44.042 --> 14:45.608
- and his wife.
- Who?

14:45.610 --> 14:47.242
The king of peppercorns.

14:47.244 --> 14:51.314
He's a pompous old windbag,
but it's 50 guilders.

15:06.765 --> 15:09.367
- Oi, where's me money?
- It's coming soon.

15:16.273 --> 15:19.342
<i>So, in the form
of a struggling young artist</i>

15:19.344 --> 15:23.783
<i>minding his manners,
upheaval entered the house</i>

15:29.687 --> 15:31.755
I have an appointment.

15:31.757 --> 15:34.058
A globe for far-flung trade,

15:34.060 --> 15:35.691
scales for the weighing
of our sins

15:35.693 --> 15:38.561
on Judgment Day, and... death,

15:38.563 --> 15:40.295
to remind the spectator,
"Vanity,

15:40.297 --> 15:42.699
vanity, all is vanity."

15:42.701 --> 15:45.135
But where
would portrait painters be

15:45.137 --> 15:47.406
without a little bit of vanity?

16:03.621 --> 16:06.122
Like this, I think.

16:06.124 --> 16:07.623
And I here.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.028
Hmm?

16:14.466 --> 16:15.701
No.

16:20.205 --> 16:21.340
Here.

16:23.173 --> 16:25.077
Allow me.

16:31.382 --> 16:32.485
Hold still.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.461
Mmm.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.367
<i>I saw the future
in the mirror that day.</i>

16:52.369 --> 16:54.370
<i>But I didn't know it.</i>

17:02.847 --> 17:06.551
Yes, put your brush
to capturing my wife.

17:08.854 --> 17:10.285
Hmm.

17:10.287 --> 17:11.755
How's business?

17:11.757 --> 17:14.390
It is you
who are in business, sir.

17:14.392 --> 17:16.391
Granted.

17:16.393 --> 17:18.528
Our Dutch republic is
the richest nation on Earth.

17:18.530 --> 17:19.896
Supply and demand,

17:19.898 --> 17:22.297
that's how it goes...

17:22.299 --> 17:24.667
- peppercorns or portraits,
- Mouth.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.769
nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves,

17:26.771 --> 17:28.403
Chinese porcelain,

17:28.405 --> 17:31.439
and all more reliable
than tulip bulbs.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.876
But, of course,
my best investment was

17:33.878 --> 17:36.648
- my Sophia here.
- Cornelis, how can you?

17:45.422 --> 17:46.558
See you on the floor.

17:48.594 --> 17:50.826
- First time?
- Hey?

17:50.828 --> 17:52.394
Buying or selling?

17:52.396 --> 17:53.930
Are we talking about
tulip bulbs?

17:53.932 --> 17:55.599
- We are.
- Buying.

17:55.601 --> 17:56.933
Right answer.

17:56.935 --> 17:59.468
Follow me.

17:59.470 --> 18:00.871
I'll waive the formalities.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.541
Thank you, Reud.

18:04.543 --> 18:07.275
- Good man.
- Silence please, gentlemen!

18:07.277 --> 18:08.511
Let me have your attention!

18:08.513 --> 18:10.647
Can't hear myself think.

18:10.649 --> 18:12.916
<i>Willem charged headlong
into something</i>

18:12.918 --> 18:15.518
<i>he knew only by rumor:</i>

18:15.520 --> 18:18.286
<i>the tulip market.</i>

18:18.288 --> 18:20.591
<i>It happened in the back rooms
of taverns</i>

18:20.593 --> 18:24.227
<i>where huge sums of money
were made and lost</i>

18:24.229 --> 18:26.596
- <i>as people gambled on the color of the blooms.</i>
- Done!

18:27.865 --> 18:29.533
Where is this, sir?

18:29.535 --> 18:31.567
Calm down, gentlemen,
please. Quiet!

18:31.569 --> 18:34.437
- <i>He was risking everything for us.</i>

18:34.439 --> 18:36.672
Prater, sir,
do you accept the bid?

18:36.674 --> 18:38.909
- The bid is accepted.
- Done.

18:38.911 --> 18:40.342
I thank you!

18:40.344 --> 18:42.445
Prater's agent for St. Ursula's,

18:42.447 --> 18:43.814
the sisters' tulip garden.

18:43.816 --> 18:45.882
How much have you got to spend?

18:45.884 --> 18:47.382
18 florins.

18:47.384 --> 18:49.018
That might get you
a few single colors.

18:49.020 --> 18:52.255
Prater's got a parcel
of whites coming up.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.724
Don't be scared to speak up.

18:53.726 --> 18:55.758
Are they a good investment,
whites?

18:55.760 --> 18:58.661
The whole market's going up.
You won't go wrong.

18:58.663 --> 19:01.530
- Parcel of whites offered to the room...
- This is the one.

19:01.532 --> 19:02.833
...by Mr. Prater here.

19:02.835 --> 19:04.767
- Where are they?

19:04.769 --> 19:06.536
In the ground a while yet.

19:06.538 --> 19:09.640
It's the certificate of
ownership that changes hands.

19:09.642 --> 19:10.907
- Seven at the back.
- Eight up here!

19:10.909 --> 19:12.307
- Eight!
- Nine!

19:12.309 --> 19:14.044
- Nine!
- Ten here, sir!

19:14.046 --> 19:15.612
Ten from the new face
at the front.

19:15.614 --> 19:17.380
- Who's got 11? Show me 11.
- 13!

19:17.382 --> 19:19.548
- 13 from the ladies.
- 13 from the ladies on the stair.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.485
- 14.
- Good.

19:21.487 --> 19:23.285
- 15 here.
- 16!
- 16!

19:23.287 --> 19:24.320
16, 17, anyone?

19:24.322 --> 19:25.454
- Seventeen.
- Go on.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.690
- 18!
- 18!

19:27.692 --> 19:29.926
18 to the young man.

19:29.928 --> 19:32.996
- Can I get 19?
- Do I hear any 19s? No?

19:32.998 --> 19:36.033
Mr. Prater, sir,
bidding stands at 18 florins.

19:36.035 --> 19:38.333
- The id is accepted.
- Yours.

19:39.938 --> 19:41.938
Well done.

19:41.940 --> 19:43.573
Go and get the certificate.

19:43.575 --> 19:45.842
- Mr. Prater, sir.

19:45.844 --> 19:47.744
18 precisely. Many thank yous.

19:47.746 --> 19:49.478
- Very good.
- Thank you, sir.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.814
Done.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.348
An excellent investment.

19:52.350 --> 19:53.850
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

19:53.852 --> 19:56.753
- What are you gonna bid on next?
- I bid thee farewell.

19:56.755 --> 20:00.791
Yes, yes. Our church
has withdrawn our patronage

20:00.793 --> 20:03.359
from painters
and now it's our everyday lives,

20:03.361 --> 20:06.630
which are immortalized in the
rich colors of the altarpieces.

20:06.632 --> 20:10.302
We stand staring out
of our lives.

20:11.636 --> 20:13.603
They're paintings of silence.

20:13.605 --> 20:15.040
Cornelis, let him think.

20:16.642 --> 20:18.107
He's an artist.

20:18.109 --> 20:20.442
Well, I hope so.

20:20.444 --> 20:22.679
Eyes.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.017
Hand.

20:27.819 --> 20:29.085
Please don't break the pose.

20:29.087 --> 20:30.421
Mm.

20:38.997 --> 20:40.332
A bit tight.

20:43.134 --> 20:45.468
Where would you like me
to be placed?

20:45.470 --> 20:46.605
Stand here.

20:49.141 --> 20:50.476
Chin up.

20:51.109 --> 20:53.478
No, your chin.

20:54.747 --> 20:56.813
Gerrit...

20:56.815 --> 20:58.147
hold still.

20:58.149 --> 20:59.882
Flat.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.487
Gerrit.

21:21.507 --> 21:22.773
What is it?

21:22.775 --> 21:26.409
That painter;
I don't want him back.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.577
He's not coming back
for two weeks.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.045
My daylight hours
are spoken for.

21:30.047 --> 21:32.448
I don't want him here.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.150
I don't want us to have
our portrait painted.

21:34.152 --> 21:35.552
But why not?

21:35.554 --> 21:36.753
It's dangerous.

21:36.755 --> 21:37.888
Dangerous?

21:37.890 --> 21:40.891
To our standing in God's grace.

21:40.893 --> 21:42.558
It's vanity.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.427
"God's grace"?

21:44.429 --> 21:46.699
Come where we can sit.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.968
What is it really?

21:51.970 --> 21:54.136
It's too expensive.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.972
Not dangerous, but expensive?

21:56.974 --> 21:59.743
I don't like him.

21:59.745 --> 22:02.143
You're a whirligig of reasons.

22:02.145 --> 22:03.479
He's impudent.

22:03.481 --> 22:04.815
Well, he's an artist.

22:04.817 --> 22:06.650
But, look,

22:06.652 --> 22:08.183
I can pay him off,
we get another.

22:08.185 --> 22:10.987
There's no lack of artists
in Amsterdam.

22:10.989 --> 22:13.489
I'll get Thomas de Keyser.

22:13.491 --> 22:15.624
Yes.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.526
Get him.

22:17.528 --> 22:18.931
Anyone.

22:20.198 --> 22:21.997
Well, let it sit,

22:21.999 --> 22:25.904
and if you're still in
the same mind next week, then...

22:35.948 --> 22:38.017
Faster, you wanton hussy!

22:40.818 --> 22:43.920
Faster! Faster!

22:43.922 --> 22:46.489
Fire the cannons!

22:46.491 --> 22:49.860
Ah, my bones are shaken to bits!

22:49.862 --> 22:52.828
God, forgive me.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.229
That must be sinful.

23:00.905 --> 23:02.104
-What...?

23:02.106 --> 23:05.110
I've changed my mind.

23:06.778 --> 23:09.513
I don't want another painter.

23:09.515 --> 23:11.014
Let that man come back.

23:20.625 --> 23:22.758
- Oh, your ladyship.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.628
Please, may I speak
with your cook?

23:24.630 --> 23:26.062
Shh.

23:26.064 --> 23:27.263
They're both at home.

23:27.265 --> 23:29.230
Mm-hmm.

23:29.232 --> 23:30.869
Apologies.

23:43.146 --> 23:45.517
Oh, your hands.

23:51.022 --> 23:52.858
Mm.

24:21.653 --> 24:24.019
Oh, Maria.

24:28.893 --> 24:31.760
- Willem?
- Mm-hmm.

24:31.762 --> 24:34.567
Willem, we've been robbed.
It's empty.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.069
What is it?

24:40.005 --> 24:43.205
This will see us get married.

24:43.207 --> 24:46.910
Mm. With six children
'round our table...

24:46.912 --> 24:49.180
like we said.

24:52.182 --> 24:54.985
But you haven't
done anything foolish?

24:54.987 --> 24:56.686
<i>Gomez offered</i>

24:56.688 --> 24:59.321
to sell me the bulbs
for the price of a new coach,

24:59.323 --> 25:01.123
a good horse, harness and all.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.659
It's a madness.

25:02.661 --> 25:04.325
It goes against all reason.

25:04.327 --> 25:07.262
Isn't it supply and demand
just the same, Cornelis?

25:07.264 --> 25:09.264
Yes, but....

25:09.266 --> 25:11.101
If nutmegs grew like mussels,

25:11.103 --> 25:13.937
you'd get a barrelful
for a florin.

25:13.939 --> 25:16.371
I had no idea I had married
a philosopher of finance.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.643
Governor, a word.

25:20.645 --> 25:21.980
Forgive me.

25:43.868 --> 25:46.038
Don't move.

25:53.711 --> 25:56.311
That's the color of blue
the Italian masters used

25:56.313 --> 25:58.346
for the mother of Jesus.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.816
Do you know why they dressed
the Virgin in blue?

26:00.818 --> 26:03.886
Because
it's the color of purity.

26:03.888 --> 26:07.090
Because it's the color
which cost the most.

26:07.092 --> 26:09.158
<i>Oltremarino.</i>

26:09.160 --> 26:11.293
Blue from over the sea.

26:13.364 --> 26:16.466
From a blue stone mined
in one place only and far away.

26:58.209 --> 27:00.943
Finger.

27:17.863 --> 27:19.227
God help me.

27:19.229 --> 27:21.765
I'm in love.

27:30.173 --> 27:34.275
I'm going to Mrs. Overvalt,
my dressmaker.

27:34.277 --> 27:35.911
- I wasn't asking.

28:09.313 --> 28:12.015
Yes?

28:12.017 --> 28:13.250
Is Mr. Van Loos at home?

28:14.819 --> 28:17.056
He's not home.

28:19.222 --> 28:22.256
It wasn't important.

28:22.258 --> 28:25.229
I'll write to her.

28:34.972 --> 28:36.972
Get his arm.
Get his arm on it.

28:39.577 --> 28:41.342
Get him up!

28:41.344 --> 28:43.112
Oh, I get him.

28:43.114 --> 28:45.480
Pull!

28:50.588 --> 28:53.458
Took his own life
over a tulip bulb.

29:09.273 --> 29:11.874
What have you got there?

29:11.876 --> 29:15.410
I've had a letter
from Mr. Van Loos.

29:15.412 --> 29:18.179
The painter has written to you?

29:18.181 --> 29:20.048
Yes.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.919
What has the fellow got
to write to you about?

29:22.921 --> 29:25.190
Let me see.

29:26.356 --> 29:29.224
The audacity.

29:29.226 --> 29:32.393
The painter writes
to ask for my tulips.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.497
What do you say to that?

29:34.499 --> 29:36.666
Your week's wages wouldn't pay
for them.

29:36.668 --> 29:39.102
That could say something
about my wages.

29:39.104 --> 29:41.269
He only asks to borrow them

29:41.271 --> 29:43.006
before they lose their bloom.

29:43.008 --> 29:45.577
You should let him, sir,
if you want their likeness.

29:47.244 --> 29:50.013
Well, you can take them to him
in the morning.

29:50.015 --> 29:52.047
Uh, first day of the month
tomorrow.

29:52.049 --> 29:54.382
I have plans with my mother.

29:54.384 --> 29:57.185
Breakfast will be under
a cheesecloth in the larder.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.957
Well, my dear, would you mind

30:00.959 --> 30:04.226
taking Mr. Van Loos my tulips?

30:04.228 --> 30:07.231
Tell him I want them back
by close of day.

30:09.299 --> 30:11.198
Come on, hurry up!
Hurry up!

31:37.654 --> 31:39.289
You may rest, Mr. Sandvoort.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.335
May I?

31:54.404 --> 31:57.742
My wife tells me
our portrait pleases.

32:02.211 --> 32:05.447
You've caught her beauty, sir,

32:05.449 --> 32:10.786
as well as her innocence
and purity.

32:12.824 --> 32:16.562
My wife cannot abide
a compliment to herself.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.330
Is that so, Mrs. Sandvoort?

32:44.622 --> 32:46.692
If you will.

33:35.171 --> 33:37.843
First to flower,
first to fall.

33:57.595 --> 34:00.428
Sister,
uh, the abbess, please.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.797
- In the garden.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

34:07.805 --> 34:10.672
You're late, young man.

34:10.674 --> 34:14.208
And Lord save us,
you smell of fish.

34:14.210 --> 34:17.279
Mr. Prater says you know
your business, so look sharp.

34:17.281 --> 34:19.681
- The gate's locked at sundown.
- I am Willem Brok.

34:19.684 --> 34:22.417
- Do you mind staying downwind?

34:22.418 --> 34:24.386
Uh, I-I bought a parcel
of his whites.

34:24.388 --> 34:25.719
He said I should come here

34:25.722 --> 34:27.556
to get the certificate
countersigned.

34:27.559 --> 34:30.958
- Oh, so you're not the rat catcher?
- No. No.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.228
Would you kindly take me
to the abbess, please?

34:33.230 --> 34:36.465
Well, unless you have a pen and
ink pot about you, follow me.

34:55.987 --> 34:58.487
Is this an orphanage?

34:58.489 --> 35:00.622
We take them in
off the streets,

35:00.624 --> 35:02.858
feed them, school them,

35:02.860 --> 35:05.894
and send them out
to fend for themselves

35:05.896 --> 35:07.862
as kitchen maids,
scullery maids...

35:11.969 --> 35:14.236
They find husbands,
or worse,

35:14.238 --> 35:16.807
or remain here as novices.

35:26.516 --> 35:29.417
Ugh, the nerve of it.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.787
Oh...

35:32.956 --> 35:35.458
Mm, that's better.

35:35.460 --> 35:36.795
No offense.

35:37.996 --> 35:39.729
A Gouda, red and yellow.

35:39.731 --> 35:41.263
The least rare
of rarities,

35:41.265 --> 35:42.865
but our prize tulip so far.

35:42.867 --> 35:45.867
The purple and white
lords it above the Gouda,

35:45.869 --> 35:48.370
but top of the scale
is the crimson and white.

35:49.372 --> 35:51.539
That's rarely seen.

35:51.541 --> 35:52.941
St. Ursula's has been
growing tulips

35:52.943 --> 35:55.610
for the flower market
for years and years.

35:55.612 --> 35:58.279
Single-colored tulips
by the bushel.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.883
I paid 18 florins
for these whites.

36:00.885 --> 36:03.285
I'm told if they
continue to rise,

36:03.287 --> 36:06.621
in a month
they'll be worth double.

36:06.623 --> 36:07.923
Mm.

36:07.925 --> 36:09.995
Let's see.

36:11.795 --> 36:15.463
"Abbess" is a courtesy title.

36:15.465 --> 36:18.633
I see. Forgive me.

36:18.635 --> 36:21.936
50 whites, just come into bloom.
W. Brok.

36:21.938 --> 36:23.706
18 florins.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.574
Hmm.

36:25.576 --> 36:27.945
A month ago, you could have
had them for ten.

36:35.719 --> 36:37.989
Beautiful.

36:40.557 --> 36:43.059
What's that?

36:43.061 --> 36:45.896
That one?

36:49.534 --> 36:51.967
A miracle.

36:51.969 --> 36:53.968
It's a breaker.

36:53.970 --> 36:56.041
A breaker?

36:57.373 --> 36:59.575
Mr. Prater.

36:59.577 --> 37:02.377
You appear to have sold off
49 whites

37:02.379 --> 37:05.415
and one crimson and white
for 18 florins.

37:06.684 --> 37:09.784
God forgive me.

37:09.786 --> 37:11.052
God might.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.787
But I wish He, for once,

37:12.789 --> 37:16.691
wouldn't work
in mysterious ways.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.128
Cut the flower
and sell the bulb.

37:19.130 --> 37:22.429
<i>You have a rare one.</i>

37:55.932 --> 37:57.666
Eh, who are you?

37:57.668 --> 37:59.467
This is Willem's patch.

37:59.469 --> 38:01.103
Not anymore.
He sold it to me.

38:01.105 --> 38:03.738
- He sold his license?
- And his basket.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.007
What would you like today?

38:05.009 --> 38:06.174
Fresh bream?

38:06.176 --> 38:07.909
How about a length of eel?

38:07.911 --> 38:09.947
I've got a nice thick eel.

38:17.855 --> 38:19.621
You're not ready.

38:19.623 --> 38:20.889
It's 7:00.

38:20.891 --> 38:23.691
I don't want to go.

38:23.693 --> 38:25.994
But you enjoy playing cards
at the Steens'.

38:25.996 --> 38:28.496
- Last time you won.
- I feel sick.

38:28.498 --> 38:30.766
You go.

38:30.768 --> 38:32.802
Well, my night is ruined.

38:32.804 --> 38:35.003
I suppose we'll need
to stay home.

38:35.005 --> 38:37.505
No. I want you to go.

38:37.507 --> 38:40.642
I'm better alone, please.

38:40.644 --> 38:42.711
They're your old friends.

38:42.713 --> 38:46.581
I feel better if I know
you've got good company.

38:46.583 --> 38:49.920
I'll be home before the watch
sounds the trumpet.

39:18.516 --> 39:19.981
The bidding stands
at 810 guilders.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.483
Are we all done?

39:21.485 --> 39:23.017
- And 20.
- 20.

39:23.019 --> 39:24.519
- 30.
- 30.

39:24.521 --> 39:25.987
- And 40.
- 40.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.154
- 50.
- 50!

39:27.156 --> 39:28.557
- 60.
- 60.

39:28.559 --> 39:29.925
- 70.
- 70.

39:29.927 --> 39:32.628
- 80.
- 900!

39:32.630 --> 39:33.896
- 900.
- 910.

39:33.898 --> 39:36.632
910.

39:36.634 --> 39:38.566
Are we all done?

39:38.568 --> 39:40.068
Anyone for 920?

39:40.070 --> 39:42.704
920. Thank you, Mr. De Bye.

39:42.706 --> 39:45.039
Mr. Brok, 920 guilders.

39:45.041 --> 39:46.575
Do you accept the bid?

39:46.577 --> 39:47.809
Yes, sir. I do, sir.

39:47.811 --> 39:49.010
- Please.
- Sold!

39:49.012 --> 39:51.579
Well done, Mr. Brok.

39:51.581 --> 39:54.214
How much fish must you sell
to bring in 920 guilders, hmm?

39:54.216 --> 39:57.185
How do you know I sell fish?

39:57.187 --> 39:59.521
Did you already name
your flower, Mr. Brok?

39:59.523 --> 40:02.124
- Yes, sir. Admiral Maria.
- Unusual.

40:02.126 --> 40:04.559
You're a wealthy man, now.

40:04.561 --> 40:05.793
God loves you, Mr. Brok.

40:05.795 --> 40:07.630
Well, he must love my Maria,
also.

40:07.632 --> 40:08.831
"My Maria" now.

40:08.833 --> 40:10.900
Oh, no, no.
My future wife.

40:10.902 --> 40:12.867
We're getting married soon.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.268
Mr. Prater,

40:14.270 --> 40:17.237
I told myself I'd stop
after 800 florins.

40:17.239 --> 40:19.775
It's more than enough
for me, so...

40:19.777 --> 40:22.581
for the orphans, please.

40:25.615 --> 40:27.315
No, certainly not.

40:27.317 --> 40:28.983
- Would you like a hand with that, my darling?
- No, tart.

40:28.985 --> 40:30.653
You paid a fair price
there, sir.

40:30.655 --> 40:33.088
It'll drop if Admirals start
popping up like daisies.

40:33.090 --> 40:36.027
If not, you will double it.

40:37.594 --> 40:40.194
Next item on the stand,

40:40.196 --> 40:42.501
a single Alexandra bulb.

41:02.285 --> 41:03.786
Maria!

41:05.722 --> 41:07.726
Maria!

41:09.726 --> 41:11.261
Maria!

41:21.236 --> 41:23.641
Maria!

42:27.070 --> 42:30.303
- That baby needs a drop of gin.

42:30.305 --> 42:31.907
My own mother used to say...

42:31.909 --> 42:34.274
Do you know my prize mare
is in foal,

42:34.276 --> 42:36.310
and De Lesseps, the banker,
has paid me a fee

42:36.312 --> 42:38.847
to reserve the foal
for him to buy

42:38.849 --> 42:41.315
for ten Admiral De Keys tulips
when it's born.

42:41.317 --> 42:43.183
- Did you agree?
- Of course.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.353
It's free money.

42:45.355 --> 42:47.254
What do you think, Cornelis?

42:47.256 --> 42:49.156
I think De Lesseps
must believe

42:49.158 --> 42:51.459
those tulips will be
worth nothing...

42:53.263 --> 42:56.865
...nothing by the time he'll
get a prize foal for them.

42:56.867 --> 42:59.638
- I love you.
- I love you.

43:02.404 --> 43:05.740
When I left here, I thought,
"Once is everything.

43:05.742 --> 43:07.308
I can deny myself now."

43:07.310 --> 43:09.978
But then I saw you again,
and I thought, "No, twice.

43:09.980 --> 43:13.018
Please, God, please twice."

43:15.952 --> 43:16.952
Let me look at you.

43:23.860 --> 43:26.259
Don't move.

43:26.261 --> 43:27.729
No, Jan.

43:27.731 --> 43:29.299
It will comfort me
when you've gone.

43:39.341 --> 43:42.010
You've stolen my heart.

43:42.012 --> 43:44.682
And you've stolen mine.

43:50.285 --> 43:53.154
<i>Tell me about your family.</i>

43:53.156 --> 43:56.257
<i>No one's ever
asked me that before.</i>

43:56.259 --> 43:59.762
<i>A sickness took my parents
when I was young.</i>

43:59.764 --> 44:03.499
<i>My only family lives
across the sea.</i>

44:03.501 --> 44:06.101
Oh, darling, darling, oh...

44:06.103 --> 44:07.869
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

44:10.874 --> 44:12.172
What are you doing?

44:12.174 --> 44:14.075
Cornelis will come home early.

44:14.077 --> 44:15.176
I know him.

44:15.178 --> 44:16.979
Don't go.

44:16.981 --> 44:18.783
I must.

44:20.149 --> 44:21.483
When will you come back?

44:21.485 --> 44:24.252
Tomorrow?

44:24.254 --> 44:27.789
Oh, I don't know.

44:27.791 --> 44:29.357
You do love me, don't you?

44:29.359 --> 44:30.929
Yes, I love you.

44:39.135 --> 44:40.568
Oi!

44:40.570 --> 44:44.337
I remember you, darling, huh?

44:44.339 --> 44:47.508
Oh, someone's been celebrating
all right, huh?

44:47.510 --> 44:48.876
- No.
- Yeah?

44:48.878 --> 44:50.512
No. My life is over.

44:50.514 --> 44:53.346
Don't say that.
Listen.

44:53.348 --> 44:55.583
Ooh, you're a very big boy.

44:55.585 --> 44:58.352
You got a little something
for me in your trousers?

44:58.354 --> 45:00.555
- Mm-mm.
- No? Just a little bit?

45:00.557 --> 45:02.057
No! Piss off.

45:16.940 --> 45:19.076
No!

45:20.375 --> 45:22.143
Where's that filthy
little whore?!

45:22.145 --> 45:23.945
Where's that little bitch
just stole my purse?!

45:23.947 --> 45:25.413
I want it back.
Where is she?

45:25.415 --> 45:29.086
Oi! That's my little sister
you're calling a whore!

45:42.900 --> 45:47.501
Lads! Here's one for you!

45:47.503 --> 45:49.437
Let the Navy have him!

45:49.439 --> 45:50.572
Get him up.

45:50.574 --> 45:52.907
Come on.

45:52.909 --> 45:55.308
Welcome to the Navy, sailor.

45:55.310 --> 45:56.377
It'll take you a year
to get back.

45:56.379 --> 45:59.113
- No, no. No. No! No!
- Hey, that's enough.

47:18.996 --> 47:21.099
My little soldier's ready again.

47:22.364 --> 47:23.634
Sophia...

47:27.704 --> 47:30.671
Gone?

47:30.673 --> 47:32.673
How gone? Gone where?

47:32.675 --> 47:34.241
Nobody knows.

47:34.243 --> 47:37.115
There's rumors he's gone to sea.

47:39.448 --> 47:41.449
I really thought he loved me.

47:41.451 --> 47:43.584
My poor Maria.

47:43.586 --> 47:46.152
That's not all of it.

47:46.154 --> 47:49.223
What is it?

47:49.225 --> 47:51.228
I'm going to have a baby.

47:54.363 --> 47:56.700
- Did Willem know?
- No.

47:59.003 --> 48:01.670
What am I gonna do?

48:01.672 --> 48:04.304
- Your family...
- In Friesland.

48:04.306 --> 48:06.641
I'd die of shame.

48:06.643 --> 48:09.047
My father wouldn't have me
in the house, anyway.

48:17.185 --> 48:19.621
Are you going to throw me out?

48:19.623 --> 48:21.288
No.

48:21.290 --> 48:23.324
What can I do?

48:23.326 --> 48:27.796
When my husband hears of it,
he'll...

48:27.798 --> 48:31.265
I'll keep your secret
as long as I can.

48:31.267 --> 48:34.068
I didn't want to have
to do this, madam,

48:34.070 --> 48:35.236
but if you throw me out,
I'll tell your husband

48:35.238 --> 48:36.474
what you've been up to.

48:39.742 --> 48:42.077
I'll tell him, miss.

48:42.079 --> 48:45.079
How did you know?

48:45.081 --> 48:47.314
How would I not?

48:47.316 --> 48:48.784
I'll tell him.

48:48.786 --> 48:51.753
If we sink, we sink together.

48:51.755 --> 48:54.191
You wouldn't.

48:56.059 --> 48:58.327
Please, Maria.

49:02.065 --> 49:04.599
<i>Yes, I said that.</i>

49:04.601 --> 49:07.601
<i>And I was ashamed.</i>

49:07.603 --> 49:11.205
<i>I felt the shame in my blood.</i>

49:11.207 --> 49:15.145
It's done. Do you want to see?

49:22.585 --> 49:25.787
It's well done.

49:25.789 --> 49:28.158
What's the matter?

49:29.258 --> 49:33.426
Maria knows about us.

49:33.428 --> 49:35.632
And she's going
to tell Cornelis.

50:12.167 --> 50:14.171
Cornelis.

50:15.437 --> 50:17.707
Why are you awake?

50:28.519 --> 50:33.219
God took one child
and spared my wife.

50:33.221 --> 50:35.221
And when...

50:35.223 --> 50:38.626
she was in childbed again,
crying out,

50:38.628 --> 50:41.695
I couldn't put the thought away
from me.

50:41.697 --> 50:44.532
What thought?

50:44.534 --> 50:48.470
God heard me,
and he punishes me still.

50:48.472 --> 50:51.740
Because I didn't always treat
her well.

50:51.742 --> 50:54.608
It was not in your hands.

50:54.610 --> 50:56.811
I asked...

50:56.813 --> 50:59.880
that the baby should be spared
and...

50:59.882 --> 51:01.818
not...

51:03.753 --> 51:07.356
If it were one or the other,
that...

51:09.292 --> 51:13.494
To spare the child
and take the mother.

51:13.496 --> 51:17.433
And God punished me
by taking both.

51:27.577 --> 51:29.442
God has forgiven you.

51:29.444 --> 51:32.245
No.

51:32.247 --> 51:35.451
I wasn't gonna tell you
so soon...

51:37.453 --> 51:40.588
...but I'm going to have
our child.

51:42.659 --> 51:44.357
You.

51:44.359 --> 51:46.695
Oh.

51:46.697 --> 51:50.230
Oh, my-my sweet,
my sweet Sophia.

51:52.568 --> 51:55.503
Oh, praise be to God.

52:15.390 --> 52:16.422
Maria, are you all right?

52:16.424 --> 52:17.424
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

52:17.426 --> 52:18.693
Was it valuable?

52:18.695 --> 52:19.894
- Priceless.

52:19.896 --> 52:21.762
Six months of your wages.

52:21.764 --> 52:23.565
- Cornelis, it's just a vase.

52:23.567 --> 52:24.932
It's one of a pair.

52:24.934 --> 52:27.871
So say no more about it.

52:34.442 --> 52:39.046
I made a plan to save us both.

52:39.048 --> 52:40.782
- You hide your tummy, and I can...

52:40.784 --> 52:42.650
I can stuff a pillow
down my dress.

52:42.652 --> 52:44.653
And then what?
And then when the child is born?

52:44.655 --> 52:46.054
And then we have the baby
in the house,

52:46.056 --> 52:47.822
then you can be with it.

52:47.824 --> 52:49.824
Cornelis gets a baby,
Maria keeps her job,

52:49.826 --> 52:51.525
and we will be together.

52:51.527 --> 52:53.662
- Are you mad?
- You must trust me.

52:53.664 --> 52:55.664
How? How will we...

52:57.867 --> 52:59.668
What about a doctor?

52:59.670 --> 53:00.901
I know a doctor.

53:05.308 --> 53:06.708
Dr. Sorgh.

53:06.710 --> 53:08.008
In the parlor.

53:08.010 --> 53:09.843
And bring a basin of warm water.

53:09.845 --> 53:12.680
Good morning.

53:15.585 --> 53:17.084
Where did he come from?

53:17.086 --> 53:19.353
Dr. Sorgh.

53:19.355 --> 53:20.889
Good morning.

53:20.891 --> 53:22.791
And how are we feeling today?

53:22.793 --> 53:24.925
- Blood on the sheet.
- Only a drop.

53:24.927 --> 53:26.093
It was nothing.

53:26.095 --> 53:27.595
I'm sure you're right.

53:27.597 --> 53:30.097
How is your heart beating,
Mrs. Sandvoort?

53:30.099 --> 53:32.032
Allow me.

53:32.034 --> 53:35.936
Mm? Mm. Mm. M.

53:35.938 --> 53:37.639
Nice.

53:37.641 --> 53:39.673
Neither fast nor slow.

53:39.675 --> 53:42.811
All is well, but I'd better make
an examination

53:42.813 --> 53:44.749
just to be sure.

53:47.016 --> 53:48.382
Feet up.

53:49.552 --> 53:51.686
Cornelis?

53:51.688 --> 53:54.388
Will you see what's keeping
Maria with the doctor's basin?

54:08.804 --> 54:10.003
Ow.

54:10.974 --> 54:12.809
Is everything
all right, my love?

54:15.045 --> 54:17.512
All is well, sir.

54:17.514 --> 54:18.746
Thank the Lord.

54:18.748 --> 54:22.449
Are there any special...
instructions?

54:22.451 --> 54:25.619
Plenty of rest during the day,
plenty of fresh air,

54:25.621 --> 54:29.492
nutritious soups,
milky puddings.

54:32.595 --> 54:34.161
Oh, yes, of course.

54:34.163 --> 54:35.863
Most important of all.

54:35.865 --> 54:38.465
It's imperative,
owing to Missus Sandvoort's

54:38.467 --> 54:40.101
delicate bodily constitution,

54:40.103 --> 54:44.738
no conjugal relations
until the baby's safely born.

54:44.740 --> 54:47.440
- No...?
- I'm afraid so.

54:47.442 --> 54:50.512
I recommend separate bedrooms.

54:50.514 --> 54:52.079
If the mother
is unduly disturbed

54:52.081 --> 54:54.615
during the night,
well, I fear for the child.

54:54.617 --> 54:58.019
- If you say so.

54:58.021 --> 55:01.722
As to the child,
the sex, the gender?

55:01.724 --> 55:02.891
What signs do you...?

55:02.893 --> 55:04.525
Sniff, please.

55:04.527 --> 55:06.894
Do you feel nauseous?

55:06.896 --> 55:09.496
No.

55:09.498 --> 55:11.932
A boy.

55:11.934 --> 55:13.501
- You believe so? A b...
- Mm-hmm.

55:13.503 --> 55:14.968
A boy.

55:14.970 --> 55:16.938
A boy, but... Maria?

55:16.940 --> 55:19.507
Will you stay, please?

55:19.509 --> 55:22.043
Cornelis, I feel a little shy.

55:22.045 --> 55:25.145
A boy.

55:26.849 --> 55:29.149
How are you today?

55:30.786 --> 55:32.586
Hmm.

55:32.588 --> 55:34.688
Are you all right?

55:34.690 --> 55:36.960
- Feet up.

55:38.762 --> 55:40.628
Is this necessary?

55:40.630 --> 55:41.896
Not really.

55:41.898 --> 55:45.532
Force of habit.

55:45.534 --> 55:47.068
How are you feeling?

55:47.070 --> 55:49.236
I feel sick.

55:49.238 --> 55:52.974
Well, you're pregnant.

55:52.976 --> 55:54.809
You two really think
you'll carry this off?

55:59.916 --> 56:02.149
What choice do we have?

56:02.151 --> 56:04.885
What a game.

56:04.887 --> 56:08.690
Do you think it's true to life,
Mrs. Overvalt?

56:08.692 --> 56:10.925
Hmm. Yes.

56:10.927 --> 56:13.795
Yes, he's caught the shoulder
seam, the line of the bosom.

56:13.797 --> 56:15.496
Not so good on the cuffs,

56:15.498 --> 56:17.731
but the hem stitches
are quite well done.

56:17.733 --> 56:20.601
What do you ladies
think of the likeness?

56:20.603 --> 56:23.505
He has found you, Sophia.

56:23.507 --> 56:25.606
As for Cornelis...

56:25.608 --> 56:27.608
With an older man
like Cornelis,

56:27.610 --> 56:29.978
a likeness might be
too much of a good thing.

56:29.980 --> 56:32.882
Too much of "winter and spring"
about it.

56:38.755 --> 56:40.490
You're beginning
to show, my dear.

56:45.027 --> 56:48.963
Urgent business
calls me to Utrecht.

56:48.965 --> 56:51.566
I could be gone
for as long as a few weeks.

56:51.568 --> 56:53.867
Sophia, let Maria do that.

56:53.869 --> 56:55.869
We'll be fine, Cornelis.

57:10.586 --> 57:12.586
Oh, my poor dearest.

57:12.588 --> 57:15.590
It's only natural
in the first months.

57:15.592 --> 57:17.190
Please go, it's all right.

57:17.192 --> 57:20.227
It is a small price to pay.

57:32.108 --> 57:35.809
<i>That woman in Utrecht,
she keeps asking about you.</i>

57:35.811 --> 57:38.548
<i>Ha. She wants to know
when you'll be back.</i>

57:44.252 --> 57:46.019
<i>And when the baby's born,
what then?</i>

57:46.021 --> 57:48.722
<i>I don't know.</i>

57:48.724 --> 57:50.624
<i>Perhaps the world
will come to an end</i>

57:50.626 --> 57:52.326
before then.

57:52.328 --> 57:54.664
If I were rich,
I could take you away.

57:55.931 --> 57:58.032
He would find us.

57:58.034 --> 58:02.070
He would not stop looking for me
unless I was dead.

58:04.940 --> 58:07.242
I heard those bells every day.

58:09.243 --> 58:12.746
That's where I grew up when
the plague left me an orphan.

58:12.748 --> 58:14.816
- My poor Sophia.
- No.

58:14.818 --> 58:16.887
It was my good fortune.

58:18.655 --> 58:22.927
The sisters were kind,
and we lived amongst beauty.

58:25.027 --> 58:27.862
They had a tulip garden
in the courtyard.

58:27.864 --> 58:29.831
A tulip garden?

58:29.833 --> 58:31.769
Is it still there?

58:34.169 --> 58:35.836
What are we after?

58:35.838 --> 58:37.337
Buried treasure.

58:37.339 --> 58:39.275
What?

58:40.677 --> 58:43.143
- Tulip bulbs.
- Huh?

58:43.145 --> 58:44.310
Do you have the fork?

58:44.312 --> 58:46.145
I told you to bring a fork.

58:46.147 --> 58:48.315
- This is a fork.
- A garden fork.

58:48.317 --> 58:50.384
We haven't got a garden,
we have a kitchen.

58:50.386 --> 58:52.185
You should've said.

58:52.187 --> 58:53.657
We should've brought a ladder.

58:54.923 --> 58:56.657
Go on, then.

59:01.764 --> 59:03.231
Huh.

59:05.234 --> 59:06.232
That's handy.

59:06.234 --> 59:08.268
What is this place?

59:08.270 --> 59:09.873
- A convent.
- We're stealing from nuns?

59:11.141 --> 59:12.874
They don't belong to the nuns.

59:12.876 --> 59:18.079
They belong to... the pope.

59:18.081 --> 59:21.214
Oh, I don't mind stealing
from the pope.

59:21.216 --> 59:23.449
No, no, no, no.

59:23.451 --> 59:25.853
I don't mind stealing
from no pope.

59:27.321 --> 59:29.288
- Gerrit.

59:29.290 --> 59:31.257
Geese! Geese!

59:31.259 --> 59:33.931
Geese!

01:00:03.927 --> 01:00:05.459
I'm sorry.

01:00:05.461 --> 01:00:07.326
I'm glad to see you.

01:00:07.328 --> 01:00:10.263
- Why?
- I thought you were dead.

01:00:10.265 --> 01:00:12.066
Good morning.

01:00:12.068 --> 01:00:13.399
Who are you?

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:16.335
My name is Jan Van Loos,
I'm an artist.

01:00:16.337 --> 01:00:19.272
I'm in love with a woman
who loves me.

01:00:19.274 --> 01:00:22.274
I have no money.

01:00:22.276 --> 01:00:23.945
I can't think of anything else
to say about me,

01:00:23.947 --> 01:00:25.112
except that I'm very sorry.

01:00:25.114 --> 01:00:26.279
Evidently,
not a very good artist.

01:00:26.281 --> 01:00:28.686
I think I am becoming good.

01:00:31.987 --> 01:00:33.854
Why are you weighing them?

01:00:33.856 --> 01:00:35.923
The more they weigh,
the more they're worth.

01:00:35.925 --> 01:00:38.860
Also, the more babies. Look.

01:00:38.862 --> 01:00:43.263
These little nodes,
each one will become a bulb.

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:45.800
Here is a node
from our best bulb.

01:00:45.802 --> 01:00:48.769
It sold for 920 florins
at auction.

01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:53.272
Unfortunately, we had already
sold it privately for 18,

01:00:53.274 --> 01:00:56.543
hidden amongst ordinary
simple-color flowers.

01:00:56.545 --> 01:00:59.145
But it's found its way home,

01:00:59.147 --> 01:01:01.849
by the generosity
of the next purchaser,

01:01:01.851 --> 01:01:06.322
who had sentimental memories
of me from many years ago.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.323
Never underestimate God.

01:01:10.325 --> 01:01:11.958
He forgets nothing.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.328
I would like to get a foot
into the tulip business.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.067
I think it's the answer
to my problems.

01:01:19.101 --> 01:01:20.236
Will you help me?

01:01:26.009 --> 01:01:28.174
First you can get
your feet among those.

01:01:28.176 --> 01:01:31.781
They belonged to a fishmonger
who disappeared into the Navy.

01:01:34.283 --> 01:01:36.883
Lift them, store them,
put them into the market.

01:01:36.885 --> 01:01:40.523
Replace them, and then
invest wisely with the surplus.

01:01:42.025 --> 01:01:44.223
Perhaps you'll make
your fortune.

01:01:53.603 --> 01:01:55.068
We're selling!

01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.205
Jan!

01:01:59.141 --> 01:02:00.440
I don't feel right?

01:02:00.442 --> 01:02:01.842
Where?

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:03.243
My head.

01:02:03.245 --> 01:02:05.479
You just need some rest.

01:02:09.085 --> 01:02:10.952
- Make your bid.
- Ten!

01:02:10.954 --> 01:02:13.453
That's 49 whites
worth 49 guilders.

01:02:13.455 --> 01:02:16.122
- You're mad.
- 22 or I walk.

01:02:16.124 --> 01:02:18.324
- Done.
- <i>I have a terrible craving</i>

01:02:18.326 --> 01:02:21.028
for... sugared almonds.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.431
Sugared almonds?

01:02:23.932 --> 01:02:25.566
I'll get some tomorrow.

01:02:25.568 --> 01:02:27.901
You're very kind to me, madam.

01:02:27.903 --> 01:02:31.037
There's an Admiral Eyck
to be offered to the room.

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:33.608
20 florins each buys us
a 50th share

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:35.976
in a connoisseur's bulb,
maybe more.

01:02:35.978 --> 01:02:38.210
Word is, by the time
it goes back on the market,

01:02:38.212 --> 01:02:40.947
its value will have doubled;
that's how the market works!

01:02:40.949 --> 01:02:43.183
If the market keeps going up,
why is anybody selling anything

01:02:43.185 --> 01:02:44.451
if it's going to double
in a month?

01:02:44.453 --> 01:02:46.185
Then we can get in
early on a bulb

01:02:46.187 --> 01:02:47.347
that might triple in a month!

01:02:52.929 --> 01:02:54.426
But it can't go on forever,
can it?

01:02:54.428 --> 01:02:56.898
- Oh, it can! - Why not? Why can't it?
- Mr. De Bye!

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.568
I call it the
theory of the greater fool.

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:02.970
- There you are! Are you in? Are you in?

01:03:02.972 --> 01:03:04.370
- I'm in!
- Yes!

01:03:04.372 --> 01:03:06.941
Grout needs to be white, madam.

01:03:06.943 --> 01:03:08.308
What are you doing?

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:10.377
You're supposed to be resting.

01:03:10.379 --> 01:03:12.612
Bored.

01:03:12.614 --> 01:03:14.179
You don't just
wipe the ironwork.

01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:16.483
You have to polish it
in the summer.

01:03:16.485 --> 01:03:19.487
He notices if you don't
and he's coming back today.

01:03:19.489 --> 01:03:20.987
You'll need a bigger cushion.

01:03:20.989 --> 01:03:22.523
We'll start the auction at 240!

01:03:22.525 --> 01:03:24.659
We're gonna be rich.
We're gonna be rich!

01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:26.961
- 240!
- 540!

01:03:26.963 --> 01:03:29.228
- 580!

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:30.230
- 600!
- Six!

01:03:30.232 --> 01:03:32.364
- 720!
- Come on. Nine!

01:03:32.366 --> 01:03:34.467
Here, here, here! Sir!

01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:35.503
Seven!

01:03:35.505 --> 01:03:37.137
Right over here!

01:03:37.139 --> 01:03:38.270
750!

01:03:38.272 --> 01:03:39.706
Do we have 800? Anyone?

01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:40.977
I'll give you 12!

01:03:42.176 --> 01:03:43.375
Give me 1,200!

01:03:43.377 --> 01:03:45.915
The offer stands at 1,200.

01:03:47.181 --> 01:03:49.050
I'll take that bulb off you

01:03:49.052 --> 01:03:52.686
for a half-share
in five Miracle cream

01:03:52.688 --> 01:03:54.353
- and purples.
- Who are you?

01:03:54.355 --> 01:03:56.388
- Your landlord's bailiff.
- No.

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:58.726
It's a disgrace,
sending these bailiffs around!

01:03:58.728 --> 01:04:00.561
I'm worth hundreds!

01:04:00.563 --> 01:04:03.196
If I went liquid now, I'd be
a bigger fool than I look.

01:04:03.198 --> 01:04:04.999
Even bigger?

01:04:05.001 --> 01:04:06.136
Shut up, Gerrit.

01:04:08.137 --> 01:04:09.506
Hey!

01:04:12.141 --> 01:04:13.976
Hey, you forgot the nicest one!

01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:17.577
Do you see what's happening?

01:04:17.579 --> 01:04:18.979
The connoisseurs' bulbs
are rising

01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:21.682
more than the common bulbs.

01:04:21.684 --> 01:04:23.382
All we have to do
is put all our eggs

01:04:23.384 --> 01:04:24.751
in one basket.

01:04:24.753 --> 01:04:26.586
Yes.

01:04:26.588 --> 01:04:28.321
A single bulb.

01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:30.023
The rarer the better.

01:04:32.361 --> 01:04:34.393
Boat tickets, Mr. Van Loos.

01:04:34.395 --> 01:04:35.662
As ordered.

01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.063
600 florins.

01:04:37.065 --> 01:04:38.330
- Cash.
- Certainly.

01:04:38.332 --> 01:04:39.469
After tomorrow's auction.

01:04:42.472 --> 01:04:44.472
- 220!
- 230!

01:04:44.474 --> 01:04:46.740
- 250!
- 240!

01:04:46.742 --> 01:04:48.708
300!

01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:51.045
- Weren't you an artist?
- I still am, this is just...

01:04:51.047 --> 01:04:53.046
Oh-ho, I see.

01:04:53.048 --> 01:04:54.615
I'm still a weaver!

01:04:54.617 --> 01:04:56.017
500!

01:04:56.019 --> 01:04:59.285
- 550!
- 600!

01:04:59.287 --> 01:05:02.122
Mr. Prater tells me
you've been busy.

01:05:02.124 --> 01:05:04.592
He doesn't mean painting.

01:05:04.594 --> 01:05:06.292
You're losing your bloom
and, unlike tulips,

01:05:06.294 --> 01:05:08.461
yours will not be renewed
in the spring.

01:05:08.463 --> 01:05:10.163
I have a proposition.

01:05:10.165 --> 01:05:11.699
I'm worth a thousand florins
in bulbs and certificates

01:05:11.701 --> 01:05:13.700
at today's prices.

01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:16.637
I'd like to invest everything
in your fishmonger's Admiral.

01:05:16.639 --> 01:05:19.507
Your proposition is absurd.

01:05:19.509 --> 01:05:22.610
The Admiral Maria
is not a snapdragon.

01:05:22.612 --> 01:05:25.411
It's a 2,000 florin tulip bulb.

01:05:25.413 --> 01:05:27.815
Which I'm willing
to let go for 1,500,

01:05:27.817 --> 01:05:29.583
out of charitable feeling.

01:05:29.585 --> 01:05:31.216
1,200.

01:05:31.218 --> 01:05:32.720
Fourteen.

01:05:32.722 --> 01:05:35.154
And I have to go and choose
the hymns for matins.

01:05:35.156 --> 01:05:36.490
Done.

01:05:36.492 --> 01:05:38.525
- I'll need a week or two.

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:03.083
Willem. Go.

01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:24.137
- Maria?

01:06:24.139 --> 01:06:25.738
What's happening?

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.708
- Shh!
- Oh, it's starting.

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:30.143
- It's starting to hurt.
- Are you sure?

01:06:32.147 --> 01:06:33.717
Cornelis!

01:06:35.851 --> 01:06:37.283
Cornelis?

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:38.621
- I think it's starting!
- Maria!

01:06:40.154 --> 01:06:42.221
Maria, go fetch the midwife!

01:06:42.223 --> 01:06:44.525
- No, no. No.
- Go fetch the midwife!

01:06:44.527 --> 01:06:46.326
I need her here with me.

01:06:46.328 --> 01:06:48.664
Go! Go!

01:06:53.167 --> 01:06:54.534
Come here.

01:06:54.536 --> 01:06:55.802
Hurry.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:57.505
- Come on.

01:06:57.507 --> 01:06:59.339
- Take it slowly.
- Oh, it's coming.

01:06:59.341 --> 01:07:00.641
One step at a time.

01:07:13.388 --> 01:07:16.789
- Breathe. Breathe for me.

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:19.424
- Ooh, child.

01:07:37.379 --> 01:07:38.648
Dr. Sorgh, thank God!

01:07:40.916 --> 01:07:42.315
How is she?

01:07:42.317 --> 01:07:44.851
Your midwife won't let me in.

01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:48.388
Poor Sophia has been
in labor for four hours.

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:55.963
Who is it?

01:07:55.965 --> 01:07:57.266
Dr. Sorgh.

01:07:58.232 --> 01:07:59.232
Shh.

01:08:00.234 --> 01:08:01.601
Hmm. Hmm.

01:08:01.603 --> 01:08:03.303
Wait.

01:08:03.305 --> 01:08:04.771
- Shh.

01:08:14.951 --> 01:08:16.483
Sophia.

01:08:16.484 --> 01:08:17.751
You're doing so well.

01:08:17.752 --> 01:08:20.953
And breathe, and...

01:08:22.992 --> 01:08:25.491
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:08:29.497 --> 01:08:30.731
And again.

01:08:32.434 --> 01:08:33.603
Yes!

01:08:35.336 --> 01:08:37.435
- Mr. Sandvoort?
- Yes!

01:08:37.438 --> 01:08:39.270
Mr. Sandvoort.

01:08:39.273 --> 01:08:40.707
How is she?

01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:42.241
It's fine.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:44.408
The birth will be fine.

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:46.913
But I must just ask you some
questions about Mrs. Sandvoort.

01:08:46.916 --> 01:08:50.984
Has she suffered with great heat
these past weeks?

01:08:50.987 --> 01:08:52.486
Heat?

01:08:52.488 --> 01:08:55.354
Did she seem hot to the touch?

01:08:55.357 --> 01:09:00.325
In truth, my wife hasn't
wanted me to touch her

01:09:00.327 --> 01:09:02.261
for many months.

01:09:02.264 --> 01:09:03.696
Ah.

01:09:03.698 --> 01:09:06.332
Well, the skin
may have been painful.

01:09:06.334 --> 01:09:07.867
Why?

01:09:07.868 --> 01:09:10.270
I'm sure it's nothing.

01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.638
<i>Come here.</i>

01:09:31.761 --> 01:09:33.328
What's wrong?

01:09:36.599 --> 01:09:37.697
Hello?

01:09:37.698 --> 01:09:39.332
- No answer?

01:09:39.334 --> 01:09:41.433
- Shall I get that?
- Hello?

01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:47.339
My master sends me to ask Maria
a question.

01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:48.408
Ask me.

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.576
- Is it started yet?
- Yes.

01:09:50.578 --> 01:09:52.310
- What is it?
- What is what?

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:54.647
What it is that has started.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.849
- Did he ask you to ask that?
- No.

01:09:56.851 --> 01:09:58.418
What?

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.521
Dr. Sorgh?

01:10:00.523 --> 01:10:03.656
- Not now.
- Please, I need to speak to you.

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.424
- No. No.
- Dr. Sorgh!

01:10:05.426 --> 01:10:07.594
- Dr. Sorgh!
- No.

01:10:07.596 --> 01:10:10.030
Dr. Sorgh.

01:10:10.032 --> 01:10:12.332
- Sorgh.
- Dr. Sorgh!

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:15.102
Not now, please.

01:10:15.104 --> 01:10:16.673
I insist on speaking to you.

01:10:26.782 --> 01:10:29.549
I-If it should come
to a choice,

01:10:29.551 --> 01:10:32.585
let the baby go, I beg of you.

01:10:32.587 --> 01:10:35.824
In God's name, spare my wife.

01:10:38.425 --> 01:10:41.362
Isn't that up to God?

01:10:58.145 --> 01:11:00.349
Keep bearing down.

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.084
Oh, that's it.

01:11:04.086 --> 01:11:05.655
Oh, well done.

01:11:23.872 --> 01:11:25.808
Oh...

01:11:27.042 --> 01:11:29.713
Is that my baby?

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.527
Thank you.

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.999
Come on, child.

01:12:01.844 --> 01:12:03.009
- At that price...
- But they were fetching

01:12:03.011 --> 01:12:04.510
- over a thousand last week.
- Last week?

01:12:04.512 --> 01:12:06.112
Precisely.
The market has changed.

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:07.981
I'm not interested,
I'm not buying.

01:12:07.983 --> 01:12:10.651
I don't care.

01:12:10.653 --> 01:12:13.218
Please, are you really
not going to bid for this?

01:12:14.923 --> 01:12:17.023
Please, it's not that high.

01:12:17.025 --> 01:12:20.494
- 300, come on.
- 300? No. I'm sorry, Mr. Daan.

01:12:20.496 --> 01:12:22.463
- One week ago...

01:12:22.465 --> 01:12:23.632
Sorry, Mr. Daan, no.

01:12:26.935 --> 01:12:29.570
Is she all right?

01:12:29.572 --> 01:12:33.009
A healthy baby, sir,
congratulations, a daughter.

01:12:34.476 --> 01:12:36.578
But Sophia?

01:12:44.987 --> 01:12:46.919
Your attention!

01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:49.022
I have the most celebrated
new bloom

01:12:49.024 --> 01:12:52.692
for many a season!

01:12:52.694 --> 01:12:55.196
The Admiral Maria.

01:12:56.599 --> 01:12:59.164
Safely wrapped in straw

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:01.535
and stored for the man
that buys it today.

01:13:01.537 --> 01:13:03.268
- Why are you selling it now?
- Yeah, what is it you know?

01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:05.170
- What have you heard?
- I'm leaving Amsterdam.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:08.976
I sail for the East Indies
on tomorrow's tide.

01:13:08.978 --> 01:13:11.209
Well.

01:13:11.211 --> 01:13:13.546
There it is.

01:13:13.548 --> 01:13:16.214
A unique opportunity
to this room.

01:13:16.216 --> 01:13:18.152
Admiral Maria.

01:13:20.088 --> 01:13:21.890
Who will bid?

01:13:55.925 --> 01:13:57.924
It was the contagion.

01:13:57.926 --> 01:13:59.692
The foul waters of our city.

01:13:59.694 --> 01:14:01.563
You must not touch her.

01:14:13.609 --> 01:14:16.174
She's with God.

01:14:18.613 --> 01:14:19.882
What sort of God is that?

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:23.619
Why did he have to take her?

01:14:30.124 --> 01:14:33.059
I told you. Damn you!

01:14:33.061 --> 01:14:35.795
Damn you, I told you.
I begged you to spare her!

01:14:37.065 --> 01:14:39.799
- It was plague!
- Sir.

01:14:39.801 --> 01:14:42.602
By the law of the city,
the room must be fumigated,

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:44.604
- the bedding burned, the body taken...
- Let me kiss her.

01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:47.173
- Let me... let me kiss her!
- The room must be fumigated,

01:14:47.175 --> 01:14:48.842
- the bedding burned,
- Let me kiss her!

01:14:48.844 --> 01:14:50.611
and the body taken directly
to a place of burial

01:14:50.613 --> 01:14:51.844
without funeral.

01:14:51.846 --> 01:14:53.279
I need to kiss her!

01:15:13.166 --> 01:15:14.603
Four hundred.

01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:18.705
Thank you, madam. 400.

01:15:18.707 --> 01:15:21.911
Any advance from 400?

01:15:24.846 --> 01:15:27.245
Five hundred.

01:15:27.247 --> 01:15:30.017
Five. Five at the front.

01:15:30.019 --> 01:15:31.918
Five hundred.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.653
- 600 here.
- Six here.

01:15:33.655 --> 01:15:34.821
- 700 here.
- Seven.

01:15:34.823 --> 01:15:36.187
Here, sir.

01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:37.390
900! 900!

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.527
- Maria.

01:17:20.529 --> 01:17:22.865
Yes, you, too.

01:17:25.868 --> 01:17:28.768
We must call a wet nurse.

01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:31.772
The wet nurse already came.

01:17:31.774 --> 01:17:34.142
She sucked well.

01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:44.249
It's God's will
that your wife was taken.

01:17:44.251 --> 01:17:47.122
But it's also His will that
He has given you a daughter.

01:17:48.524 --> 01:17:53.730
A beautiful,
healthy daughter.

01:17:55.362 --> 01:17:58.364
For that we must be thankful.

01:17:58.366 --> 01:18:02.568
I will care for her

01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:05.006
as if she were my own child.

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:20.451
There, there.

01:18:20.453 --> 01:18:24.256
We will call you Sophia.

01:18:24.258 --> 01:18:28.460
She has my nose,
don't you think?

01:18:28.462 --> 01:18:31.031
I'm afraid there's a small extra
charge for the pallbearers.

01:18:31.033 --> 01:18:32.464
I had to buy their silence,
you understand.

01:18:32.466 --> 01:18:34.232
Of course.

01:18:34.234 --> 01:18:35.602
Do you see this?
Do you know how much

01:18:35.604 --> 01:18:37.536
Mr. De Bye is paying for this?
8,000 guilders.

01:18:37.538 --> 01:18:39.437
Enough for two houses
on the Herengracht.

01:18:39.439 --> 01:18:42.307
Come back later, you'll have
everything I owe you, I promise.

01:18:42.309 --> 01:18:44.076
Hmm, no disrespect, sir,
but I'll wait here.

01:18:44.078 --> 01:18:46.012
Do you have any libation?

01:18:46.014 --> 01:18:48.446
I've come to collect money
for your tickets.

01:18:48.448 --> 01:18:50.116
- Tickets?
- Two passages to the Indies

01:18:50.118 --> 01:18:51.585
on the <i>Empress of the East.</i>

01:18:51.587 --> 01:18:53.586
And I'm not leaving until
I've got money in my hands.

01:18:53.588 --> 01:18:56.022
- That's me orders, sir.
- You leaving the country?

01:18:56.024 --> 01:18:58.160
And he's not coming back!

01:19:00.028 --> 01:19:02.328
- Do you have the cash?
- I do. Do you have the bulb?

01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:04.063
I'm not accepting
the certificate only.

01:19:04.065 --> 01:19:05.431
Well, I shall fetch it
this instant.

01:19:05.433 --> 01:19:06.866
No, you don't.
The last time,

01:19:06.868 --> 01:19:08.267
you left me waiting
a whole month.

01:19:08.269 --> 01:19:10.035
What, you think I'm going
to slip my leash?

01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:11.638
- Yes.
- Can one of you explain to me

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.007
how I'm to bring the
Admiral Maria to Mr. De Bye

01:19:14.009 --> 01:19:16.342
and pay you all off if I am kept
prisoner in my own house?

01:19:16.344 --> 01:19:17.847
Send your friend.

01:19:21.181 --> 01:19:22.181
Are you sober?

01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:26.052
I can't remember
what a drink tastes like.

01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:27.418
Right. Take this.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.288
Bring it to St. Ursula's.

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:32.191
They'll have a package for you.
And, Gerrit, listen to me.

01:19:32.193 --> 01:19:33.529
Stay off the drink.

01:19:36.097 --> 01:19:38.364
Go.

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:51.477
Gerrit, you old tosspot!

01:19:51.479 --> 01:19:53.946
Come and have a jar!

01:19:53.948 --> 01:19:55.146
Mm-mm.

01:19:55.148 --> 01:19:57.415
Oi, Gerrit, where you going?

01:20:10.698 --> 01:20:14.432
- Sophia.

01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:18.073
- You're in our house.
- You're free.

01:20:20.074 --> 01:20:21.644
Easy.

01:20:23.545 --> 01:20:26.114
I've done a terrible thing.

01:20:30.953 --> 01:20:32.521
What have I done?

01:20:44.197 --> 01:20:45.902
Thank you, master.

01:20:49.269 --> 01:20:52.004
What is it?

01:20:52.006 --> 01:20:53.706
A gift from our garden.

01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:56.041
- An onion.
- Oh.

01:20:56.043 --> 01:20:57.744
Very nice.

01:20:57.746 --> 01:21:00.016
Nice to see it by daylight.

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:04.921
Remember your Bible.
There were two thieves.

01:21:08.221 --> 01:21:10.557
Thank you. Sorry.

01:21:10.559 --> 01:21:12.592
So sorry.

01:21:12.594 --> 01:21:15.293
Only one was saved.

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.282
Is he coming?

01:21:40.122 --> 01:21:42.557
Gerrit. Oh, thank God!

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.027
I've come for my money.

01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:51.262
Have a seat.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.040
I have to go back.

01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:04.044
I-I have to go.

01:22:04.046 --> 01:22:07.279
No, you have to stay here.

01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:10.652
Move! Move!

01:22:14.321 --> 01:22:16.055
Don't hurt the animal!

01:22:16.057 --> 01:22:18.058
That's not nice!

01:22:23.163 --> 01:22:26.066
You can't go.

01:22:26.068 --> 01:22:27.700
- Sophia, if you go...
- Please.

01:22:27.702 --> 01:22:28.701
...you'll bring us all
down with you.

01:22:28.703 --> 01:22:31.302
Gerrit... Gerrit the hero!

01:22:31.304 --> 01:22:34.306
Gerrit the hero!
Gerrit the hero!

01:22:34.308 --> 01:22:36.240
Gerrit the hero!
Gerrit the hero!

01:22:36.242 --> 01:22:39.545
Gerrit the hero!
Gerrit the hero...

01:22:39.547 --> 01:22:43.051
- Tell Jan I'm sorry.

01:22:45.087 --> 01:22:47.853
Tell him the fever broke.

01:23:04.337 --> 01:23:06.673
Drink! Drink! Drink!

01:23:06.675 --> 01:23:08.540
Drink! Drink! Drink!

01:24:44.304 --> 01:24:48.808
<i>So Sophia realized
there was no going back,</i>

01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:51.680
<i>and no way forward.</i>

01:24:55.448 --> 01:24:57.348
<i>She saw too late
it was a trap</i>

01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:59.852
<i>she had laid for herself,</i>

01:24:59.854 --> 01:25:02.891
<i>and she had been better dead.</i>

01:25:11.466 --> 01:25:12.799
You can do it.

01:25:17.805 --> 01:25:19.738
Come on, lads!

01:25:45.499 --> 01:25:47.799
- Coming.

01:25:57.612 --> 01:25:59.311
Willem.

01:25:59.313 --> 01:26:01.550
Maria.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:05.820
Where have you been?

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.621
Africa.

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:12.959
Africa. Africa!

01:26:12.961 --> 01:26:15.628
Listen, I've only come here
to tell you the truth, Maria.

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:17.565
You've been to Africa?!

01:26:19.701 --> 01:26:21.534
- Tell me the truth.
- What the, tell you the truth?

01:26:21.536 --> 01:26:22.835
What are you talking about?

01:26:22.837 --> 01:26:24.335
I saw you
and that bastard painter!

01:26:24.337 --> 01:26:26.338
- What? What-what?
- Betraying me, Maria!

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:28.339
- I didn't think you had that in you!
- Me and the painter?

01:26:28.341 --> 01:26:29.976
- I saw you, yes.
- That was my mistress

01:26:29.978 --> 01:26:31.878
and the painter.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.513
- Willem.

01:26:34.515 --> 01:26:37.016
Willem.

01:26:37.018 --> 01:26:40.989
That was Missus Sandvoort
and the painter.

01:26:45.592 --> 01:26:46.992
Shh.

01:26:55.402 --> 01:26:58.071
- Shh.

01:26:58.073 --> 01:26:59.608
Shh.

01:27:02.543 --> 01:27:04.977
She's yours.

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.786
She's ours.

01:27:29.136 --> 01:27:32.504
âª I've been fighting gypsies âª

01:27:32.506 --> 01:27:36.374
âª I've been saving donkeys âª

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:40.411
âª I've been fighting Bacchus. âª

01:27:40.413 --> 01:27:42.349
Where in God's name
have you been?

01:27:44.618 --> 01:27:47.789
I've been fighting gypsies.

01:27:51.493 --> 01:27:55.427
I've been fighting Bacchus.

01:27:55.429 --> 01:27:57.863
I fought 'em.

01:27:57.865 --> 01:27:59.600
And I won.

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.950
Where's the package?

01:28:17.451 --> 01:28:18.985
Gerrit.

01:28:18.987 --> 01:28:21.787
The package.

01:28:21.789 --> 01:28:24.891
From St. Ursula's.

01:28:24.893 --> 01:28:26.828
The onion?

01:28:29.130 --> 01:28:30.729
I ate it.

01:28:31.966 --> 01:28:34.599
- I don't believe it.
- I ate it.

01:28:34.601 --> 01:28:37.702
- Yeah.
- You've done what?

01:28:37.704 --> 01:28:40.473
- I don't believe it.
- You bloody fool.

01:28:40.475 --> 01:28:44.442
- What? - Bloody fool.
- Everything I had.

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.778
My boss ain't gonna
be happy about this.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:49.882
- We're all done for.
- You're finished.

01:28:49.884 --> 01:28:51.404
- What?
- We'll be back.

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:55.219
What have you done?

01:28:55.221 --> 01:28:58.627
Oh, dear.

01:29:02.161 --> 01:29:04.964
Let her stay gone, sir.

01:29:04.966 --> 01:29:06.702
Let her stay dead.

01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:10.769
Oh, sir...

01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:14.040
She was driven by madness.

01:29:14.042 --> 01:29:16.545
We all were.

01:29:38.065 --> 01:29:39.534
It's all right.

01:29:41.002 --> 01:29:42.938
It's all right.

01:29:58.019 --> 01:29:59.619
<i>"Mistress Maria,</i>

01:29:59.621 --> 01:30:01.218

01:31:34.782 --> 01:31:36.682
Where has she gone?

01:31:36.684 --> 01:31:38.283
She saw what she'd done.

01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:40.151
Jan...

01:31:40.153 --> 01:31:42.090
the bubble burst.

01:31:45.224 --> 01:31:47.160
I must find her.

01:31:48.762 --> 01:31:49.864
Sophia!

01:31:52.065 --> 01:31:53.330
Sophia!

01:31:55.301 --> 01:31:57.334
It's done, I'm sorry.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.710
I'm ruined!

01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:06.747
Jan!

01:32:15.023 --> 01:32:16.958
Oh, God.

01:32:20.127 --> 01:32:23.427
Jan. Jan! Stop! Stop!

01:32:23.429 --> 01:32:27.066
Sophia!

01:32:29.703 --> 01:32:31.639
Sophia!

01:32:33.239 --> 01:32:35.175
Sophia.

01:32:40.847 --> 01:32:43.347
She's gone.

01:32:43.349 --> 01:32:45.285
Sophia.

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:09.008
<i>Soon after, the government</i>

01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:11.943
<i>stepped in
and banned tulip trading.</i>

01:33:11.945 --> 01:33:13.277
<i>Overnight, the market crashed.</i>

01:33:13.279 --> 01:33:16.280
<i>Thousands were left destitute.</i>

01:33:16.282 --> 01:33:19.485
<i>All this stemmed
from a love of beauty,</i>

01:33:19.487 --> 01:33:21.954
<i>a passion for flowers</i>

01:33:21.956 --> 01:33:25.222
<i>whose lives are even briefer
than our own.</i>

01:33:25.224 --> 01:33:29.194
<i>But while the blooms had faded,</i>

01:33:29.196 --> 01:33:32.034
<i>the paintings remained.</i>

01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:08.432
You have brought her to life.

01:34:08.434 --> 01:34:10.902
Only to torment me the more
by knowing she's dead.

01:34:10.904 --> 01:34:13.004
- You know that, Mr. Van Loos?
- Yes.

01:34:13.006 --> 01:34:15.140
She drowned herself.

01:34:15.142 --> 01:34:17.374
We cannot say we know
more than we can know.

01:34:17.376 --> 01:34:19.244
Leave the rest to God.

01:34:19.246 --> 01:34:21.983
He doesn't like mopers.

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:25.550
Your patron brought me here,

01:34:25.552 --> 01:34:27.887
because he wishes
to commission a work from you.

01:34:30.891 --> 01:34:34.093
Think of this
as a place of solace.

01:34:34.095 --> 01:34:36.261
You will not be disturbed.

01:35:18.438 --> 01:35:21.574
<i>Stories don't end.</i>

01:35:21.576 --> 01:35:24.441
<i>They only go
their separate ways.</i>

01:35:24.443 --> 01:35:26.845
<i>We take leave of them.</i>

01:35:26.847 --> 01:35:28.314
<i>Not knowing what comes after.</i>

01:35:31.886 --> 01:35:34.218
<i>Cornelis has a new life...</i>

01:35:36.023 --> 01:35:38.557
<i>...and a family to love.</i>

01:35:38.559 --> 01:35:40.092
<i>As do I.</i>

01:35:41.895 --> 01:35:43.928
Oopsy daisy!

01:35:45.632 --> 01:35:49.503
Oh, look at this clever
little girl!

01:35:51.905 --> 01:35:54.039
Sophia! Sophia!

01:35:54.041 --> 01:35:58.943
<i>Your story is only beginning,
my little Sophia.</i>

01:35:58.945 --> 01:36:02.080
<i>And now you know the truth.</i>

01:36:02.082 --> 01:36:05.017
<i>You're named
for my dear friend,</i>

01:36:05.019 --> 01:36:08.352
<i>who, despite all
the wrong she did,</i>

01:36:08.354 --> 01:36:11.924
<i>helped bring you
into this world.</i>

01:36:11.926 --> 01:36:14.325
- Mommy, he's jumping around again.
- Oh, no.

01:36:14.327 --> 01:36:15.831
Help your sister through.

01:36:18.532 --> 01:36:20.598
- Jacob, make room for your sister.
- Daniel.

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.200
Come to the table.

01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:35.647
For what we are about
to receive, O Lord,

01:36:35.649 --> 01:36:39.050
for thy blessings
and thy bounty

01:36:39.052 --> 01:36:41.954
from the harvest
of the land and the oceans.

01:36:41.956 --> 01:36:44.222
And for this house
of Mr. Sandvoort,

01:36:44.224 --> 01:36:46.156
bless him and his new family
in the Indies.

01:36:46.158 --> 01:36:49.695
For everything that we have,

01:36:49.697 --> 01:36:52.497
in good times and bad,
now and forever.

01:36:52.499 --> 01:36:55.333
May your servants
be truly thankful.

01:36:55.335 --> 01:36:57.635
<i>It was Mr. Sandvoort's desire</i>

01:36:57.637 --> 01:36:59.537
<i>that Willem and I
should live in his house,</i>

01:36:59.539 --> 01:37:03.341
<i>and bring you up as
the daughter Sophia gave him.</i>

01:37:03.343 --> 01:37:06.711
<i>But now you know why we have
always loved you as our own.</i>

01:37:06.713 --> 01:37:09.580
<i>Our firstborn,
Willem's and mine,</i>

01:37:09.582 --> 01:37:11.983
<i>because that is what you were,</i>

01:37:11.985 --> 01:37:13.383
<i>and always have been.</i>

01:37:13.385 --> 01:37:16.154
<i>My own Sophia.</i>

01:37:16.156 --> 01:37:17.925
Amen.

01:37:19.025 --> 01:37:21.463
- Amen.
- Amen.
