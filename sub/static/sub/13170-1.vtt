01:45.339 --> 01:49.343
Sorry. Are you alright?
I'm getting my radar fixed Monday.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.345
- You live in New York?
- I do.

01:51.345 --> 01:56.350
- Lynn! There you are! I didn't see you there.
- You are shameless.

01:56.350 --> 02:00.287
- That woman was 6 months pregnant.
- Which is the reason I flirted with her.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.289
It made her day.
It made her feel really good.

02:02.356 --> 02:06.293
- So, it was out of compassion, right?
- I知 working on it.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.294
- Good. What about the other woman?
- Blind.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.298
- Blind.
- Blind... like love.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.569
So what about tonight? Am I going to see you?
Should I come to the restaurant?

02:15.669 --> 02:18.572
Tonight's not good. It's... so busy tonight.
I don't think so.

02:18.639 --> 02:22.643
- Maybe I'll come by and surprise you.
- I don't like surprises actually, no.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.178
Come on!

02:35.155 --> 02:37.890
I知 looking to see the Chilean Sea Bass.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.993
- It's not on the sideboard?
- No. I see no Bass.

02:40.727 --> 02:46.099
I知 gonna kill that son-of-a-bitch!
Fakir! Did you move my fish?

02:46.099 --> 02:50.037
I知 talking to you.
Did you move my fish?

02:50.170 --> 02:54.107
Could it be this one lying here
disguised as an Artic Char?

02:54.107 --> 02:59.079
Artic Char! The other son-of-a-bitch,
Glucksman, who calls himself the fish man.

02:59.079 --> 03:03.116
- Boss, I知 getting pissed.
- I validate that emotion. Netto, Problem!

03:03.150 --> 03:05.152
- Yes, boss.
- Bouillabaisse?

03:05.152 --> 03:08.088
- In there 20 minutes.
- This pot is empty.

03:08.088 --> 03:14.194
- This pot is bouillabaisse-less.
- Fakir! What did I tell you?

03:14.194 --> 03:17.130
- You got a minute, boss?
- Yeah. Where'd it go?

03:17.130 --> 03:20.067
- Taste it.
- Tumeric.

03:20.167 --> 03:23.003
- No tumeric!
- How much? Three or four?

03:23.103 --> 03:28.075
- Four.
- You're right. Perfect. Congratulations!

03:52.098 --> 03:55.035
Excuse me? I知 here to meet Will.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.608
Of course.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.116
I know, I got it, I got it.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.152
What happened to Lynn?

04:12.186 --> 04:14.087
I believe I baked that cake.

04:14.087 --> 04:18.156
Light up the oven. There's
a fresh bowl of batter at the door.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.195
I知 an easy-going guy, right?

04:22.062 --> 04:25.999
I知 good to my staff. I treat them well.
Is that a mistake?

04:26.099 --> 04:30.070
Because, an occasion, one of them has
stepped over the line and said very...

04:30.070 --> 04:32.408
familiar things about my private life.
- If I didn't feel like...

04:32.482 --> 04:35.279
I was leading these poor women to the
slaughter one after the other...

04:35.342 --> 04:38.079
I could build a shute to keep a count
by the front door.

04:39.079 --> 04:44.051
- So, warning you has no effect?
- No. It's like a Greek tragedy, isn't it?

04:44.117 --> 04:48.121
OK guys, I've got bad news.
I知 kicking you out...

04:48.155 --> 04:52.059
so other people may eat.
Here are your checks.

04:54.159 --> 04:59.031
The good news is the bar drinks
are on me. Tommy?

04:59.165 --> 05:01.068
- You got it.
- Thanks.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.837
Lady, what am I gonna do with you?
You're killing me.

05:04.937 --> 05:09.076
- Us? Come on!
- How about I set you up out on the patio?

05:09.076 --> 05:12.145
- Out on the patio?
- Before my bartender leaves his wife.

05:12.145 --> 05:16.083
- I was divorcing her anyway.
- Restrain yourself, Tommy.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.119
Eriko...

05:21.154 --> 05:25.092
- Are you too busy?
- It's frantic tonight, a madhouse.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.627
- Can you bear with me 2 minutes?
- Sure.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.062
Alright, I'll be back.

05:32.063 --> 05:35.447
We got the heat going now. Billy? The
heat's gonna be up all the way around?

05:37.169 --> 05:39.606
I got this and the champagne
is coming in any second.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.508
Happy Birthday to you...

05:41.641 --> 05:45.578
Happy Birthday to you...

05:45.578 --> 05:50.550
Happy Birthday dear Charlotte...

05:50.650 --> 05:56.623
Happy Birthday to you...

06:02.629 --> 06:06.566
Everything okay?
I'll come back later.

06:11.638 --> 06:15.575
- Finally. I知 sorry. You alright?
- Is that Will Keane? It sure is.

06:15.709 --> 06:22.515
He hasn't changed a bit. What did you
do, make a deal with the devil?

06:24.617 --> 06:31.591
- I知 sorry, do...
- Come on. It痴 Dolores Talridge.

06:31.624 --> 06:35.628
- Dolly? I can't believe it...
- Be careful of the cocktail.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.634
- Oh my God...
- I know.

06:41.634 --> 06:46.539
- Time has kicked my ass a little.
- No, don't be silly. You look wonderful.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.642
Will... spare me the bullshit.

06:57.684 --> 07:02.589
Honey, are you feeling alright?
You look sort of sea foam green.

07:02.622 --> 07:06.626
I知 fine.
It痴 him.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.562
- He's how old?
- Who cares?

07:09.629 --> 07:13.633
lf he's rich as well, you might
have a fight on your hands.

07:13.700 --> 07:20.607
I want you all to meet an old
chum of mine. He's irresistible.

07:20.674 --> 07:26.579
He's Will Keane. And he owns
this overpriced establishment.

07:26.613 --> 07:31.151
Overpriced? I can't believe you'd say...
Where else are you gonna find a beet salad...

07:31.185 --> 07:36.623
for under 35 bucks?
- I loved the Chilean Sea Bass. I'm Shannon.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.559
- Shannon. Thank you.
- I知 Simon.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.594
- Hi Simon.
- Nice to meet you.

07:41.594 --> 07:45.565
You too.
May I ask whose birthday this is?

07:45.665 --> 07:50.637
The birthday girl happens to be
my granddaughter, Charlotte.

07:53.673 --> 07:56.609
It痴 not Katie's daughter?

07:56.609 --> 08:01.581
You bet.
She's got Katie's eyes, hasn't she?

08:02.682 --> 08:05.618
And talent! Forget about it.

08:05.618 --> 08:11.591
Do you know that this kid made
from scratch all these crazy hats?

08:11.725 --> 08:15.662
- They're great.
- Then she got serious with mine.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.598
- Pretty sassy, isn't it?
- Very elegant.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.668
- Isn't it divine?
- You're not kidding about this?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.670
Have I ever lied to you?

08:23.703 --> 08:26.606
No, it's wonderful.
Really wonderful work.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.678
Do you speak?

08:33.613 --> 08:38.684
- Thank you.
- So, you're Katie's daughter.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.621
- So that makes you about...
- Twenty-two and never been kissed.

08:41.621 --> 08:46.693
No, I don't buy that.
Happy Birthday, Charlotte.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.629
- Thank you.
- Great to see you again, Dolly.

08:49.729 --> 08:54.701
- Great to see you, Will.
- Go right in there. There you go.

08:54.701 --> 08:59.673
- Great seeing you. Bye.
- Be still my beating heart.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.709
- Or, is that yours?
- I think it's mine.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.645
He's cute but
he's a little old for Charlotte.

09:05.779 --> 09:09.716
- He's simply fabulous.
- How do you know him?

09:09.716 --> 09:12.652
From Newport. He's an
old friend of your Mom's.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.759
Thanks, Melissa. Good night.

09:19.759 --> 09:24.597
When Will Keane comps 3 bottles of Crystal to
an underage girl, I know what'll happen.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.633
She's not underage. She's 22.

09:26.633 --> 09:30.704
- I know her grandmother.
- Tell me you're not gonna date her.

09:30.704 --> 09:34.641
The grandmother? I promise
I知 never touching that woman.

09:34.641 --> 09:38.712
You know what's wrong with people like
you? Too much sex. It melts the brain.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.648
- Here we go.
- No worry about that around our house.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.684
I知 on your side. I知 the good guy.

09:44.684 --> 09:48.621
I知 sorry. I melt
at least 3 times a week.

09:48.755 --> 09:52.692
- Is he lucky I知 off the market or what?
- They wouldn't even look at him.

09:52.692 --> 09:56.629
- You hear? They wouldn't look at you.
- You're going to do this, aren't you?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.665
What is it with you two?

09:58.798 --> 10:00.704
Will you give me some credit?

10:00.798 --> 10:04.704
I smile at this girl, she bushes from
head to toe. Why would I do this?

10:04.771 --> 10:08.675
Knock it off. You'd kill
to be in his place.

10:16.716 --> 10:20.720
- Okay bitch, I知 ready.
- Not me!

10:20.787 --> 10:27.627
- Can we start with "good-morning"?
- My God, I知 so sorry. Who is this?

10:27.727 --> 10:29.629
Guess.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.602
- You?
- I guess.

10:35.735 --> 10:39.673
- Who'd you think it was?
- My friend, Simon.

10:39.673 --> 10:44.644
He always call me the morning
after to... dish.

10:46.680 --> 10:51.651
- Do you want to talk to my grandmother?
- No, I was calling you.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.688
- You were?
- I got this little problem.

10:54.688 --> 11:00.096
I thought you could help me out. I got a
Benefit coming up. One of those...

11:00.196 --> 11:05.567
black tie worthy cause,
lousy food kind of thing.

11:05.667 --> 11:13.974
And I was wondering...
I'd like you to make a hat... for me.
Actually, not for me, it's for my date.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.677
I don't wear hats,
except to Yankee games.

11:20.747 --> 11:26.720
The problem is that I don't know her hat
size and I don't want to ask her...

11:26.720 --> 11:32.692
because it's a surprise.
- Was it that woman you were with last night?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.627
No.

11:35.762 --> 11:39.699
Cause she had an
abnormally small head.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.635
It might account for
the limited conversation.

11:43.770 --> 11:47.707
I could always put in
an adjustable band.

11:48.708 --> 11:53.680
- That's perfect. Wonderful.
- It is risky doing it this way.

11:53.780 --> 11:58.652
You can do it. Life rewards the
courageous few. You can do this.

11:58.752 --> 12:02.722
Can you give me
a point of inspiration?

12:02.722 --> 12:07.627
- Like what?
- Like an image. This hat is like...

12:07.794 --> 12:12.732
Like the line of a woman's hip.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.704
- Okay.
- When can I have it?

12:19.739 --> 12:23.643
- Let's say... two weeks.
- Great!

12:23.710 --> 12:28.615
- I'll give you till Thursday, 4 o'clock.
- Okay. Wow.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.684
One other thing...

12:30.817 --> 12:34.754
- you say "wow" an awful lot.
- I know.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.656
You're a grown-up now.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.658
- When is that going to stop?
- Soon.

12:38.792 --> 12:42.696
- I'll see you Thursday.
- Okay. Bye.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.667
Wow.

12:57.777 --> 13:02.682
- Mikey, how you doing?
- I can't complain.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.751
You're early, aren't you?

13:04.751 --> 13:07.787
In this soup, you're
better safe than sorry.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.724
- Will Keane?
- Visitor.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.635
He's going to a fancy party tonight.

13:23.670 --> 13:27.607
He's up on twenty-four.
I'll key the elevator for you.

13:35.715 --> 13:39.686
Tony, this was not an ace
Parmesan from Froman's...

13:39.786 --> 13:42.722
Tony, this was more like
a pepperino from Scarsdale...

13:42.722 --> 13:44.658
I know the difference!

13:44.758 --> 13:48.695
It痴 a different price.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.667
- You're late.
- I know.

13:53.767 --> 13:57.737
I知 so sorry. I tried to get a cab and
couldn't. I took the subway and...

13:57.737 --> 14:01.675
Yeah, yeah, it's alright.

14:01.775 --> 14:07.747
What's the point of being young and beautiful
if it's not to keep men waiting.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.607
In fact...

14:10.617 --> 14:15.655
I知 disappointed. I was looking forward to at
least another half-hour of suspense.

14:15.789 --> 14:21.761
- I could leave and come back.
- Too late.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.698
So, whaddya got?

14:39.679 --> 14:42.749
- Try it on.
- I知 soaked.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.652
It痴 alright.
Go ahead. Try it on.

14:47.821 --> 14:51.725
You have to imagine it on your friend.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.719
Is it the line of a woman's hip?

15:19.753 --> 15:22.722
- Is it?
- Yes.

15:25.659 --> 15:29.729
- What a shame.
- Why?

15:29.729 --> 15:33.667
- She stood me up.
- Who?

15:33.667 --> 15:38.638
My date. She called an hour ago;
said she had a cold.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.675
It sounded more like
the hiccups to me.

15:41.675 --> 15:47.647
- So, you mean you're not going to go?
- Alone? No, no...

15:47.781 --> 15:49.683
Unless...

15:50.750 --> 15:52.719
What?

15:53.820 --> 15:54.754
No... no...

15:54.821 --> 15:56.690
- Wait, no... wait...
- No. Forget it.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.726
No wait, what were you
going to say?

15:59.793 --> 16:01.661
I don't know. I don't know.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.733
You wouldn't want to go, would you?

16:08.768 --> 16:10.670
Great. Forget it. Thanks.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.706
Thank you very much.

16:12.806 --> 16:13.707
It's just...

16:15.742 --> 16:20.714
- You've got the hiccups!
- Are you kidding? I'd go in a heartbeat.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.749
- You're fabulous!
- Yeah?

16:24.784 --> 16:26.686
Oh dear...

16:27.721 --> 16:30.757
- It must be me.
- Must be.

16:32.692 --> 16:37.731
- Do you think I知 too old for you?
- No, I collect antiques.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.666
Or I aspire to.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.738
We appreciate it.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.710
I would love to go,
but I知 a disaster.

16:50.710 --> 16:57.717
I think with a little plaster and a
little paint, you're as good as new.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.690
Do you wanna see the dress?

17:04.824 --> 17:06.726
There's a dress?

17:25.824 --> 17:27.925
If you need me for anything, I'll be
in the back.

19:08.848 --> 19:13.820
I知 curious. What made you choose
my restaurant for your party?

19:13.820 --> 19:19.420
I had to pick a place for my party.
I read that article about you.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.263
- The magazine!
- The magazine.

19:24.264 --> 19:28.335
- It's so embarrassing.
- No. I liked it.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.280
You don't dance. You float.

19:41.315 --> 19:43.317
That's from my dad.

19:43.317 --> 19:48.288
I used to stand on his feet.
I was floating!

19:49.323 --> 19:53.260
My mom was a great dancer too.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.296
But, you knew that. Maybe.

19:56.430 --> 19:58.332
We danced a couple of times.

19:59.366 --> 20:03.303
Now you're dancing with me.
How weird is that?

20:04.304 --> 20:07.341
She was very special.

20:10.310 --> 20:14.348
I had great parents.
I was lucky.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.320
Shall we do this?

20:41.308 --> 20:43.343
Here you go!

20:45.379 --> 20:49.316
- Do you want something to drink?
- Yes, champagne please.

20:49.316 --> 20:52.352
I'll get you one. Sit at the table
and I値l be over in a second.

21:12.339 --> 21:16.343
I had to come. I work at the museum.
What's your excuse?

21:16.410 --> 21:20.314
- A date... sort of.
- With Will Keane, right?

21:20.347 --> 21:25.352
- Yeah, do you know him?
- Only by reputation.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.323
- I知 Lisa Biloy.
- I知 Charlotte.

21:29.323 --> 21:31.258
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.294
What's he like?

21:38.398 --> 21:42.302
Damn it, I see a huge donor
disappearing. I gotta go.

21:42.336 --> 21:44.304
- Enjoy yourself.
- Yes, you too.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.417
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:57.417 --> 22:01.355
- Who was that?
- Lisa somebody.

22:08.362 --> 22:11.398
- Here's to...
- Us!

22:17.371 --> 22:20.307
Some people star to fall
into recognizable patterns.

22:20.407 --> 22:24.278
The next step is that... immediately...
you know people...

22:24.378 --> 22:29.216
on sight. And if it's a woman...
it's a romance, forget it. It's just...

22:29.349 --> 22:34.254
this majorly chilling effect 'cause
you know exactly in the beginning...

22:34.421 --> 22:36.323
what's going to happen in the end.

22:37.357 --> 22:43.330
What I like about you is I find you...
completely unprecedented...

22:43.330 --> 22:47.267
and therefore, utterly unpredictable.

22:49.303 --> 22:54.274
God! That must be a relief.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.310
What?

22:56.410 --> 23:01.381
To finally deliver that speech to a
woman and have it apply to there.

23:01.381 --> 23:06.353
Because, coincidentally,
I am all those things you just said.

23:06.353 --> 23:09.389
- Yes.
- And so much more.

23:09.389 --> 23:13.327
My yoga teacher calls me a "unique".

23:13.460 --> 23:15.362
- Come again?
- A unique.

23:15.362 --> 23:18.398
A unique. He's a very wise man.
Are you sure he's not hitting on you?

23:18.398 --> 23:22.302
It痴 a woman! You are what
she would call a "typical".

23:22.369 --> 23:24.238
- Really?
- Yes! Really.

23:25.305 --> 23:30.310
I can prove it too.
You want me to?

23:30.377 --> 23:32.346
- Okay, try.
- Alright...

23:34.314 --> 23:36.283
Come here.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.290
I知 serious.

23:44.358 --> 23:46.326
Closer.

23:49.329 --> 23:51.298
Closer...

23:55.402 --> 23:57.271
Close enough?

23:59.373 --> 24:03.377
Yes. I was hoping
gravity would do the rest.

24:14.354 --> 24:17.357
Maybe I am "typical".

24:25.365 --> 24:27.267
We should go.

24:39.346 --> 24:42.416
I can smell the rain.

24:46.353 --> 24:49.289
When did I learn how to do that?

24:56.396 --> 24:58.298
What should we do, Will...

25:01.368 --> 25:04.271
with this moment that we're in?

26:08.368 --> 26:11.371
Boy, do you look guilty.

26:11.405 --> 26:13.340
I知 thinking.

26:15.375 --> 26:18.412
- You hungry?
- Yep.

26:26.420 --> 26:29.289
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it was bad manners...

26:29.289 --> 26:33.360
to stare at a girl
while she's eating like a pig?

26:46.340 --> 26:48.342
This isn't right.

26:51.411 --> 26:53.313
You... you are...

26:54.348 --> 26:56.350
Young.

26:56.383 --> 26:59.419
Yes, and I am...

26:59.419 --> 27:01.321
Old.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.357
- Older.
- Much older.

27:03.423 --> 27:05.392
Alright, much older.  The point is...

27:10.364 --> 27:14.301
Look, I could put this off,
but I genuinely like you.

27:14.401 --> 27:19.373
I want to be clear from the start, so
there's no confusion later on, okay?

27:21.408 --> 27:24.344
What I want to say to you is that...

27:25.379 --> 27:28.415
all I知 able to offer you...

27:28.415 --> 27:33.353
is this... what we have right now.
Nothing more.

27:33.353 --> 27:36.290
Until it ends.

27:38.325 --> 27:41.395
What I mean is..

27:41.395 --> 27:44.298
we have no future.

27:46.366 --> 27:48.368
I know.

27:55.375 --> 27:57.411
I知 sick.

28:00.347 --> 28:02.349
What do you mean?

28:02.349 --> 28:05.419
It痴 my heart.

28:05.419 --> 28:10.357
Nobody even thought I'd last this long.

28:13.427 --> 28:16.363
I could've put off telling you but...

28:16.363 --> 28:19.399
I genuinely like you.

28:19.399 --> 28:23.337
I wanted to be clear
right from the start...

28:23.337 --> 28:28.408
so there was no chance
for any confusion later.

28:30.444 --> 28:35.415
She's the perfect woman. Young,
beautiful and on her way out.

28:35.415 --> 28:39.353
- Not funny, John.
- I know it's not. It痴 sad.

28:40.387 --> 28:43.423
- She's so young.
- No, I mean you're sad.

28:43.423 --> 28:46.460
Even this, as far as it's gone.
You shouldn't be doing this.

28:46.460 --> 28:49.396
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's out of whack.

28:50.531 --> 28:52.432
It doesn't feel totally out of whack.

28:52.466 --> 28:56.403
It doesn't feel totally out of whack
to you because you're looking at her.

28:56.403 --> 29:00.440
I知 looking at you and it's fucked.
There ain't a right angle in it.

29:02.476 --> 29:05.412
Alright... I end it.

29:06.446 --> 29:08.482
I don't know.

29:08.482 --> 29:11.385
Make up your mind!
What do you want me to do?

29:11.518 --> 29:16.456
I don't know. Maybe it's a good thing.
Maybe it makes a sad girl happy and

29:16.490 --> 29:22.463
a desperate guy think. Anyway you look
at it, one thing... treat her nice.

29:23.464 --> 29:25.432
What do you mean, "desperate"?

29:26.400 --> 29:28.368
Treat her nice.

30:21.522 --> 30:28.395
- Well, well...
- Well, well...

30:28.395 --> 30:30.430
She'll be right down.

30:30.430 --> 30:34.368
She's upstairs, gilding the lily,
so to speak.

30:35.502 --> 30:39.439
- He's here!
- I知 coming!

30:39.439 --> 30:42.376
Now, come on. Do come in.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.411
These are for you, Dolly.

30:44.411 --> 30:47.481
Thank you very much.

30:48.482 --> 30:51.418
They are "Loverly".

30:52.419 --> 30:55.455
Aren't they... lovely?

30:57.491 --> 31:00.427
Care for a "cock-i-tail"?

31:00.561 --> 31:02.463
- Yeah, sure.
- Scotch?

31:02.463 --> 31:05.499
- Neat, please.
- My kind of guy.

31:06.533 --> 31:11.472
Sorry about the mess.
My maid died 14 years ago...

31:11.505 --> 31:15.442
and I have found it absolutely
impossible to replace her.

31:17.478 --> 31:21.415
What can I say, Will?
Time is a thief.

31:21.515 --> 31:25.486
One day, you're rich as an Arab.

31:25.486 --> 31:31.458
Next day, you're lucky
if you can afford pistachio nuts.

31:41.502 --> 31:48.442
It痴 funny. Most of us are young for
what? About a minute and a half?

31:49.510 --> 31:54.481
Not Katie.
Katie will be young forever.

31:55.482 --> 31:58.552
So will the guy she married.

31:58.552 --> 32:02.422
I console myself
with that idea sometimes.

32:07.561 --> 32:12.533
Who'd have thought
what time had in store for her.

32:13.534 --> 32:17.437
I知 sorry. I should have
called after the accident.

32:17.504 --> 32:19.506
Then, on the other hand...

32:19.506 --> 32:23.410
time is in love with some people.

32:23.410 --> 32:26.446
Like you, for instance.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.516
You look exactly the same!

32:29.516 --> 32:32.419
- Please...
- Handsome as ever.

32:32.486 --> 32:37.391
And up to your old tricks...
looks like to me.

32:40.494 --> 32:43.363
- Look, Dolly...
- Leave her alone!

32:44.498 --> 32:46.433
She's sick.

32:47.434 --> 32:50.471
Will, she's really sick.

32:58.512 --> 33:01.415
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

33:01.548 --> 33:04.485
Just how much you look
like your mom, is all.

33:05.486 --> 33:07.521
Yes... Yes, you do.

33:08.522 --> 33:10.557
Are you ready?

33:13.494 --> 33:16.430
Yes. Bye Dolly.

33:17.564 --> 33:19.466
Don't listen to her.

33:19.466 --> 33:21.502
Have fun!

33:28.509 --> 33:32.446
You gotta look on the bright side.
lf I wasn't sick...

33:32.446 --> 33:36.350
this would not work. There is no way
that we would be sitting here.

33:36.517 --> 33:39.453
We're totally wrong for each other.

33:40.454 --> 33:43.390
We're totally wrong for each other.
I know. I could be your father.

33:44.525 --> 33:48.462
I prefer, Uncle.

33:51.532 --> 33:53.433
Do you think we should break this off?

33:59.540 --> 34:02.442
Afraid you might feel something?

34:08.549 --> 34:10.449
Well, look at it this way.

34:10.484 --> 34:13.520
We can have it real,
which we both know is way better.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.556
And, you wouldn't have
to pay full price...

34:16.556 --> 34:18.492
because, in a year or so...

34:18.592 --> 34:23.397
I'd be just this sob story
you could use to bag more chicks.

34:24.398 --> 34:27.467
That is a pathetic characterization.

34:27.467 --> 34:30.370
I don't know. I don't accept that.

34:31.472 --> 34:34.440
The stench of truth.

34:48.489 --> 34:52.391
"O world, I cannot hold
thee close enough!

34:52.559 --> 34:56.429
Thy winds, they wide grey skies!

34:56.429 --> 35:00.501
Thy mists, that roll and rise!"

35:01.502 --> 35:06.473
It does feel like rain. You wanna get a
cup of coffee, and go to the West side?

35:06.540 --> 35:09.409
No, no. You'd abandon the universe...

35:09.543 --> 35:16.517
and me for a cafe late? No, let's not do
it. Let's not do no thoughtless thing.

35:22.389 --> 35:26.460
We can't talk about
he fact that you're sick?

35:27.461 --> 35:30.397
I知 right here, right now.

35:30.397 --> 35:32.432
Let's talk about you.

35:32.432 --> 35:35.469
- Come on, 49 years...
- 48!

35:35.469 --> 35:41.441
All right, 48 years. Come on,
tell me about it. Give it. Share it.

35:45.512 --> 35:50.484
You look at me in a way
that I haven't quite earned.

35:51.485 --> 35:53.520
Then earn it.

35:54.555 --> 35:56.457
Earn it, please.

35:57.591 --> 35:59.393
What do you want me to do?

35:59.493 --> 36:01.428
I知 yours. What is it?

36:05.499 --> 36:07.401
What are you doing?

36:07.501 --> 36:09.436
I知 keeping it.

36:11.472 --> 36:14.508
- This is my watch.
- Yep.

36:14.508 --> 36:19.480
- When do I get it back?
- When you forget that I have it.

36:30.424 --> 36:32.459
Mix this up a little bit...

36:33.460 --> 36:35.496
Sorry...

36:38.432 --> 36:40.400
What?

36:40.467 --> 36:42.469
Your mother used to do that.

36:42.503 --> 36:44.471
- Really?
- Yep.

36:44.505 --> 36:49.476
That's how we met. I was a waiter...

36:49.476 --> 36:54.448
at the Beach Club. Whenever I'd pass
with a tray, she's steal the garnish.

36:54.448 --> 36:56.483
What else did she do?

36:57.484 --> 36:59.520
What do you mean?

36:59.520 --> 37:02.456
I don't know. Little things.

37:04.591 --> 37:07.461
She'd eat her ice cream with a fork.

37:07.528 --> 37:09.496
- Really?
- Really. Yeah.

37:11.498 --> 37:14.535
She wrote great letters...

37:14.535 --> 37:17.504
But she couldn't spell.

37:22.476 --> 37:27.447
She was a McGovern Democrat
but incredibly snobbish.

37:27.447 --> 37:30.484
She hummed all the time.

37:32.519 --> 37:35.456
And Stephen Stills was
her favorite singer.

37:35.456 --> 37:37.491
Who?

37:38.492 --> 37:40.427
Never mind.

37:41.428 --> 37:43.464
What else?

37:43.464 --> 37:46.500
Considering the time...
she was actually...

37:46.500 --> 37:52.473
pretty straight. I think
she only tried drugs once.

37:52.506 --> 37:55.542
There was a lifeguard
who gave her a hash brownie.

37:55.542 --> 37:57.444
She threw it up all over him.

38:00.514 --> 38:03.550
She laughed just like that.

38:05.586 --> 38:08.489
Words and poetry is what she loved.

38:09.523 --> 38:11.558
She was a "unique".

38:17.531 --> 38:19.433
Okay, you guys.

38:47.661 --> 38:49.563
How about a toast?

38:49.563 --> 38:51.498
Welcome to Charlotte.

38:51.598 --> 38:54.535
Welcome.

39:00.641 --> 39:04.578
Cheers! Thanks, you guys.

39:06.613 --> 39:11.552
You know, call me crazy... but I could
swear your friends like me more...

39:11.552 --> 39:14.488
than they like you.
- That's altogether possible.

39:14.621 --> 39:19.560
- My friends definitely like me more.
- What's your point?

39:19.593 --> 39:22.496
That I知 way out front
in the love race.

39:22.529 --> 39:26.567
- Love? Love is not a race.
- Our love is.

39:26.567 --> 39:30.504
- Our love?
- Yes, we're going for it, aren't we?

39:30.537 --> 39:32.539
Why not?

39:35.609 --> 39:39.546
- Alright, I have to tell you something.
- What?

39:41.582 --> 39:44.518
I never had a date for the benefit.

39:44.518 --> 39:46.520
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:46.553 --> 39:49.590
I was kind of wondering about that.

39:49.590 --> 39:53.494
- I made that hat for myself?
- Yes.

39:53.627 --> 39:57.598
- You bought that dress for me?
- Yeah.

39:57.598 --> 40:02.569
You did all that so you could
get a hold of me and muss me up?

40:02.569 --> 40:04.571
Yes.

40:05.606 --> 40:10.544
First of all, you have great taste
because that dress was amazing.

40:10.577 --> 40:14.515
- Thank you.
- And second, you didn't have to lie.

40:14.615 --> 40:18.585
If you wanted to seduce me,
all you had to do was ask.

40:18.585 --> 40:21.555
That's not seducing,
that is asking.

40:21.622 --> 40:26.527
Besides - I don't know why - but women
seem to love it when you lie to them.

40:26.593 --> 40:30.597
There isn't a lie in the world
I'd rather hear than the truth.

40:30.597 --> 40:34.535
There she goes again, stepping out
on me and breaking my heart.

40:34.535 --> 40:36.570
Even he likes me more.

40:36.570 --> 40:39.506
You're fired.

40:40.541 --> 40:43.577
- Come on, it's just...
- No! Ouch! Ouch!

40:54.621 --> 40:56.523
I can't believe this!

41:06.567 --> 41:08.602
Breathe, breathe.

41:10.637 --> 41:15.609
Breathe... are you alright?

41:21.582 --> 41:27.554
That's not accurate. Neuroblastoma is a
soft-tissue malignancy, but not a cancer.

41:28.589 --> 41:32.526
Most common in children.
Very rare in young adults.

41:32.626 --> 41:36.597
In Charlotte's case...
the tumor is in her chest cavity.

41:36.597 --> 41:40.534
It痴 growing rapidly, it's proved
resistant to both the radiation...

41:40.634 --> 41:44.605
and the chemotherapy.
- What about alternative therapies?

41:44.605 --> 41:46.507
Eastern medicine...?

41:49.576 --> 41:51.578
You don't hum this away.

41:53.614 --> 41:56.550
Charlotte is the expert in that area.

41:57.584 --> 42:01.622
Eventually, she'll be treated for pain.

42:01.622 --> 42:06.593
I suppose, as a final effort...
surgery could become on option.

42:06.593 --> 42:11.531
But it's risky. So risky that
Charlotte has...

42:11.664 --> 42:14.191
signed a directive forbidding it,
or any other form...

42:14.201 --> 42:17.638
of heroic intervention.

42:17.638 --> 42:19.573
All right.

42:23.510 --> 42:29.450
Do you have any idea...
about time?

42:30.617 --> 42:35.522
A year. Maybe a year, at best.

42:44.631 --> 42:47.534
Real charmer, isn't she?

42:51.605 --> 42:55.542
How are you on
Cambodian money units?

43:01.648 --> 43:04.585
- Are you okay there?
- Yes, thank you.

43:41.688 --> 43:43.557
That's incredible.

43:43.624 --> 43:46.593
Doesn't it look exactly like
something she would have worn?

43:46.593 --> 43:48.529
Who?

43:48.695 --> 43:53.600
"Hope is a thing with feathers
That perches in the soul."

43:53.600 --> 43:55.502
Woody Allen?

43:57.671 --> 44:03.544
Emily Dickinson! Only the greatest
poet ever! Uncultured swine.

44:03.644 --> 44:08.615
We all have our areas. I知 a food guy.
Why don't you ask me about food.

44:10.651 --> 44:15.589
Why are you the food guy?
What is it about the food?

44:15.589 --> 44:18.625
Food... food is the only...

44:18.659 --> 44:23.497
beautiful thing that truly nourishes.

44:24.631 --> 44:26.533
Is that a quote?

44:29.603 --> 44:31.505
That's me.

45:33.600 --> 45:37.571
- Excuse me? Excuse me?
- Yes.

45:37.571 --> 45:40.474
The woman who just passed
by here and went in the door...?

45:40.607 --> 45:43.544
- Yes?
- It's not Lisa, is it?

45:43.610 --> 45:46.580
- Yes.
- Lisa Tyler?

45:46.580 --> 45:47.648
Yes.

45:52.619 --> 45:54.588
Could you...?

45:56.690 --> 45:58.559
No. Thanks.

46:19.680 --> 46:23.584
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, you look so great.

46:23.584 --> 46:25.519
- Where are the girls?
- They're upstairs.

46:25.619 --> 46:27.521
I知 going to run up and say hi.

46:28.655 --> 46:30.591
You're a dog. Oh, man!

46:32.626 --> 46:34.528
There's stuff... in the kitchen.

46:36.028 --> 46:38.599
You want to give the candy to the
trick-or-treaters... when they come?

46:38.599 --> 46:41.535
One, two, three, go! Go!

46:42.536 --> 46:46.607
Ricky, don't laugh, or you're
going to get snot in the water.

46:46.607 --> 46:53.580
- Snot? Where is this snot in the water?
- Can I get you a bone or something?

46:55.616 --> 46:58.552
Don't bite anything
that's not an apple.

47:08.695 --> 47:10.631
Guess who?

47:13.667 --> 47:16.603
- It's Wonder Woman.
- No.

47:16.603 --> 47:19.640
- Get your hands out of there.
- I got it!

47:19.640 --> 47:21.575
- We got the champ!
- Let me give you a hint.

47:21.675 --> 47:25.646
I was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

47:25.646 --> 47:29.516
- It couldn't be Lynn McHale.
- God! You are really bad!

47:29.583 --> 47:31.618
Lynn! I can't believe it!

47:31.618 --> 47:34.555
- Where are the kids?
- Upstairs in their room.

47:34.655 --> 47:37.524
Keep bobbing for apples in there.

47:37.591 --> 47:41.595
- Just one more.
- Please...?

47:41.662 --> 47:44.598
But then you're going to have to promise
you're going to get in your jammies.

47:44.598 --> 47:46.600
- Yes.
- You promise?

47:49.670 --> 47:50.571
Which one?

47:51.572 --> 47:55.642
I know, "Butterflies".

47:56.643 --> 47:59.580
"Two butterflies... went out at noon..."

47:59.580 --> 48:03.584
"And waltzed above a stream..."

48:03.650 --> 48:11.658
"Then stepped straight through the
firmament... and rested on a beam."

48:11.658 --> 48:18.599
"And then together bore away...
upon a shining...sea."

48:18.599 --> 48:23.570
"Though never yet, in any port...

48:23.637 --> 48:26.607
their coming mentioned me..."

48:28.709 --> 48:32.579
In my day, you bobbed for the apple...
may there's a nickel in it but...

48:32.646 --> 48:37.651
you eat the apple! Your little animals,
grab the coin and run for the door.

48:37.718 --> 48:41.622
- They're off to by crack.
- Definitely.

48:42.623 --> 48:46.560
- Where's my little puppy dog?
- I think he's upstairs.

49:20.694 --> 49:23.697
- There you are.
- Hi.

49:24.698 --> 49:27.634
We were just up on
the roof checking out...

49:27.634 --> 49:32.606
- The kids are sleeping.
- John's got this amazing set-up there.

49:32.706 --> 49:34.641
Lynn, I want you to meet Charlotte.

49:34.641 --> 49:39.713
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

49:50.657 --> 49:53.694
Something tells me
you're upset with me.

49:54.728 --> 49:56.630
What is it?

49:59.800 --> 50:02.703
I was just wondering if...

50:04.738 --> 50:07.674
if you had sex with that woman?

50:09.710 --> 50:14.681
With Lynn?
Ever?

50:16.717 --> 50:21.688
- The answer to that is kind of obvious.
- She's an old girlfriend.

50:22.689 --> 50:25.626
- You knew that.
- I meant... tonight.

50:26.627 --> 50:30.697
- On the roof.
- You're not serious?

50:31.732 --> 50:37.671
You are serious. no!
No, of course not.

50:37.704 --> 50:41.642
First off, it's... it's not
exactly my style. Second...

50:41.642 --> 50:44.678
You have a girlfriend.

50:44.678 --> 50:46.713
Isn't that for me to say?

50:48.649 --> 50:54.721
As far as Lynn goes, why would I do
that? It doesn't make any sense.

50:54.721 --> 50:59.693
I know. I mean,
that's what I was thinking...

50:59.693 --> 51:06.667
we're... so happy...
What would be his reason?

51:06.800 --> 51:11.638
I thought, God, if he did do it,
then you'd at least look... guilty.

51:11.772 --> 51:15.709
And you don't.
You look totally relaxed.

51:15.709 --> 51:18.745
You look more relaxed...
than before the party started.

51:18.745 --> 51:20.681
Well... there you go.

51:21.682 --> 51:23.717
But, you're a womanizer.

51:24.751 --> 51:26.720
You were a womanizer.

51:26.787 --> 51:32.693
- What is that exactly?
- Here we go.

51:32.759 --> 51:37.664
That's a guy who has sex with a lot of
women and is good at lying about it.

51:37.664 --> 51:44.638
Yes. But in this case I don't have
anything to lie about. Nothing happened!

51:49.710 --> 51:54.681
There's something about being sick...
in my heart.

51:56.784 --> 51:59.753
It痴 like I can feel every beat.

52:07.761 --> 52:10.697
I値l know if you're lying.

52:19.740 --> 52:21.742
Oh, God!

52:23.677 --> 52:25.612
Oh, my God!

52:35.756 --> 52:39.693
- Can you pull over, please?
- Don't do this.

52:47.701 --> 52:53.674
- Charlotte! Charlotte!
- Why?

52:56.743 --> 53:01.715
Look, I never pretended to be...
what I知 not.

53:01.715 --> 53:03.717
- Why?!
- Why?!

53:03.717 --> 53:05.752
All right, fine, why? Why?

53:07.788 --> 53:10.724
Because I felt like it.

53:11.758 --> 53:14.795
Because nothing stopped me!

53:16.830 --> 53:18.732
What about love?

53:20.768 --> 53:24.671
Why do you have to be so juvenile?!
It was nothing.

53:24.705 --> 53:27.641
It was nothing! It meant nothing!

53:27.641 --> 53:30.644
If I could be different... I would.

53:30.711 --> 53:33.747
What about love?

53:40.754 --> 53:42.723
You know what?

53:43.791 --> 53:48.695
This was all wrong. This was a mistake,
right from the beginning.

53:48.729 --> 53:51.665
You're a kid... I知 a creep.

53:51.799 --> 53:55.736
You've got better things to do with
your last... with your time...

53:56.770 --> 54:00.641
than spend it with a man like me.

55:05.739 --> 55:09.676
Look who's here.
The Belle of Amherst.

55:23.690 --> 55:26.593
I've seen that face before.

55:26.727 --> 55:31.698
- You have?
- On several occasions.

55:32.699 --> 55:35.636
All for the same reason.

55:36.770 --> 55:40.707
You said Mom and Will
were just friends.

55:41.742 --> 55:47.714
They were friends.
But she was just nuts about him.

55:49.750 --> 55:51.752
She never slept with him.

55:52.786 --> 55:55.722
Maybe because she was
an old-fashioned girl.

55:56.723 --> 55:58.659
But she was smart.

55:59.760 --> 56:03.730
Until she made the big mistake.
She told him how she really felt.

56:05.766 --> 56:08.669
It was up in Newport at the club.

56:08.802 --> 56:11.738
Labor Day weekend.
Big clam bake.

56:13.774 --> 56:15.676
Well, what happened?

56:15.809 --> 56:22.616
Next thing you knew, he was knocking
up Millie What's-her-name in a cabana.

56:22.749 --> 56:26.687
- Millie?
- Your mother's doubles partner.

56:28.755 --> 56:31.658
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

56:31.658 --> 56:37.731
- You know, you could have warned me.
- I could have. But I didn't.

56:37.731 --> 56:42.703
You never talk to me.
You never tell me what to do.

56:45.739 --> 56:48.675
Charlotte, take a good look at me.

56:50.711 --> 56:53.747
You want me to tell you what to do?

56:53.781 --> 56:58.719
Yes! You're my family!

56:59.753 --> 57:01.755
You're my family.

57:02.856 --> 57:06.727
You're supposed to take care of me.

57:22.743 --> 57:25.679
- Where you been?
- Home.

57:25.679 --> 57:28.715
- I called you ten times.
- I had the ringer off.

57:28.749 --> 57:32.686
- I don't get it.
- What's to get? I was hanging out.

57:33.687 --> 57:37.758
- Something happen at my party?
- You were there. We had a good time.

57:37.758 --> 57:39.660
- Come on! What's going on?
- Nothing!

57:39.693 --> 57:42.729
What is it, something with Charlotte?

57:43.730 --> 57:46.667
- We called it quits.
- You're shittin' me!

57:46.667 --> 57:50.737
It痴 not exactly we called it quits,
it was a more of, she called it quits.

57:51.738 --> 57:53.774
- What did you do?
- What do you mean...?

57:53.774 --> 57:55.709
- What did you do?
- What did l...?

57:55.709 --> 57:57.711
Don't bullshit me. What did you do?

57:57.711 --> 58:02.683
I had sex with Lynn McHale
up on your roof.

58:03.717 --> 58:05.719
You're kidding me.

58:09.790 --> 58:12.726
No, I知 not kidding you.

58:13.861 --> 58:16.697
Now she's gone. Totally.

58:18.832 --> 58:20.734
I知 really sorry you did that.

58:21.769 --> 58:23.771
I blew it.

58:24.805 --> 58:26.707
Can you get her back?

58:27.741 --> 58:30.778
- I blew it.
- So?

58:31.812 --> 58:35.749
So, I just go back to the way I was.

58:37.785 --> 58:39.787
And how are you going to do that?

58:44.758 --> 58:47.828
It was just going to get worse.

58:50.864 --> 58:53.801
The more attachment on both sides,
leading to what?

58:56.837 --> 58:59.773
It痴 now or later, right?

58:59.873 --> 59:03.844
I leave her a few months
from now, she...

59:03.844 --> 59:08.782
No, this is better.
This is much better.

59:15.889 --> 59:19.827
I wish the fuck I'd never met her.

59:21.862 --> 59:27.734
I hate to tell you, but there's
only two kinds of love stories.

59:27.734 --> 59:30.737
Boy loses girl.
Girl loses boy.

59:30.737 --> 59:33.774
That's it. Somebody
always gets left behind.

59:33.841 --> 59:38.745
Try and avoid that, you'll end up an
old man toasting yourself at Christmas.

59:38.745 --> 59:40.781
- Listen to me...
- I don't care!

59:40.848 --> 59:46.754
- you're going to die in your own arms!
- I don't care! I want it over with now!

01:00:52.853 --> 01:00:54.788
- Mr. Keane.
- Good night, Michael.

01:00:54.788 --> 01:00:59.760
You've got a visitor.
She's been waiting almost an hour.

01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:18.812
Lisa!

01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:28.856
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- No... you surprised me, that's all.

01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:32.793
Did you get my letter?

01:01:36.864 --> 01:01:39.800
What did you do with it, burn it?

01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:43.837
I read it.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.817
- Do you want to come upstairs?
- No, thank you. I知 sorry.

01:01:56.817 --> 01:02:00.788
I didn't plan this.
I didn't plan to come.

01:02:00.888 --> 01:02:04.825
Peter, my husband
thought it was pointless.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.797
But, as it turns out,
I知 pregnant... just a few months.

01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:15.869
- Lisa! Congratulations! That's great.
- Thank you.

01:02:17.805 --> 01:02:20.841
Anyway, that made me want to meet you.

01:02:20.874 --> 01:02:25.779
I've been a little sentimental
about parenthood lately.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.753
- Do you consider me your parent?
- In a lousy absentee sort of way, yeah.

01:02:34.855 --> 01:02:40.761
- So, how... how is Millie? Your mother?
- She's great. She's good.

01:02:40.828 --> 01:02:46.867
Well, she's a nut. She went to Costa
Rica last summer with some guy.

01:02:46.867 --> 01:02:50.804
He owns a charter airline
and wears sunglasses indoors.

01:02:50.804 --> 01:02:53.874
I think he's a gun runner, but...

01:02:53.907 --> 01:02:58.812
- Do you really care?
- No. No.

01:02:59.847 --> 01:03:01.849
I guess not.

01:03:04.918 --> 01:03:09.757
What about you? How long
have you lived in the city?

01:03:09.923 --> 01:03:13.827
Just a few months.
We moved from Austin.

01:03:13.894 --> 01:03:18.899
If you hadn't been on that magazine...

01:03:19.933 --> 01:03:24.772
I might not have recognized you. I only
have one photograph and it's ancient.

01:03:24.772 --> 01:03:28.842
I have one picture of you, too.

01:03:30.844 --> 01:03:35.716
Just one. Your mother sent me one...
a long time ago.

01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:40.788
You must have been about twelve.

01:03:41.922 --> 01:03:43.824
You had a horse.

01:03:45.859 --> 01:03:49.797
Summer camp. My teeth are
bigger than the horse's.

01:03:49.797 --> 01:03:55.769
- I hated that picture. I hate it.
- I don't. You were very beautiful.

01:03:57.838 --> 01:04:00.874
And you haven't changed a bit.

01:04:17.891 --> 01:04:20.928
- I should go.
- Why?

01:04:23.764 --> 01:04:28.802
I really just wanted to meet you.
And maybe...

01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:33.740
- I don't know.
- What? Tell me.

01:04:33.807 --> 01:04:38.812
It痴 not big deal. I've always had a
fantasy that you were looking for me.

01:04:38.879 --> 01:04:42.783
And all you really wanted was
to say that you were sorry.

01:04:55.863 --> 01:04:57.798
Lisa, I am.

01:05:11.945 --> 01:05:15.816
Hey, can l... Can I call you?

01:06:38.866 --> 01:06:40.768
How did you get in here?

01:06:43.837 --> 01:06:45.839
Dolly.

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:50.744
Would you mind leaving now, please?

01:06:54.882 --> 01:06:56.917
I need to talk to you.

01:06:57.818 --> 01:07:00.854
I think you've wasted
enough of my time.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.799
What I did was... very wrong.

01:07:17.905 --> 01:07:19.807
And stupid.

01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:26.847
I have no excuses...

01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:34.888
I did what I did because...

01:07:34.888 --> 01:07:39.827
- I was scared.
- You were a coward!

01:07:47.868 --> 01:07:49.870
Can you forgive me?

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:53.841
You betrayed me! For what?
Because you got the shakes?

01:07:53.841 --> 01:07:58.812
- I was scared.
- You don't think I知 scared?!

01:07:58.912 --> 01:08:02.850
You don't think I知 hanging onto
my courage by my fingernails!

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:07.821
Don't touch me! Get away from me!
Get out of here!

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:12.893
Just go!

01:08:13.961 --> 01:08:16.830
You're not good enough.

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:20.901
I know... I know I知 not.

01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:26.874
I just...

01:08:31.944 --> 01:08:34.881
Can you let me love you?

01:08:38.952 --> 01:08:40.854
Please.

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:44.925
Please. Please...

01:08:45.959 --> 01:08:47.961
Please let me try again.

01:08:48.996 --> 01:08:51.932
I知 so tired.

01:11:13.974 --> 01:11:19.880
"The stars are as soft
as flowers and as near."

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:24.387
"The hills are webs of shadow..."

01:11:24.388 --> 01:11:27.059
"...slowly spun."

01:11:27.259 --> 01:11:35.896
"No separate leaf or single blade.
All blend to one."

01:12:21.942 --> 01:12:23.844
I love you.

01:12:41.995 --> 01:12:44.932
We did it... that was great.

01:12:44.932 --> 01:12:47.968
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:12:51.939 --> 01:12:53.974
Are you jealous?

01:12:54.975 --> 01:12:58.946
- You think...? I am not jealous!
- Yes you are!

01:12:59.046 --> 01:13:04.918
Do I look jealous? I am not jealous.
I知 a little jealous.

01:13:06.954 --> 01:13:11.959
- Wait, check me out.
- Excellent! Go! Go! Go!

01:13:12.025 --> 01:13:15.929
Judges give it a ten!
A perfect ten!

01:13:16.964 --> 01:13:18.999
Charlotte!

01:13:27.975 --> 01:13:29.910
Doctor!

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:31.912
- Mr. Keane...
- Tell me.

01:13:31.912 --> 01:13:35.883
The repeat MRI and CAT scan
show interval progression.

01:13:35.983 --> 01:13:37.951
- The tumor's grown.
- Yes.

01:13:37.951 --> 01:13:42.856
Considerably. It痴 begun to obstruct
the outflow from her heart.

01:13:43.023 --> 01:13:46.927
I知 sorry, I wish there was...

01:13:46.994 --> 01:13:51.899
There's very little we can do.
We may be talking about weeks.

01:13:51.999 --> 01:13:53.934
- Weeks?
- I知 sorry.

01:13:54.001 --> 01:13:56.970
- You said she had a year!
- No, I said a year at best.

01:13:56.970 --> 01:13:59.006
That's not good enough!
You said a year!

01:13:59.006 --> 01:14:02.943
- I want to have a year!
- This is inappropriate.

01:14:02.943 --> 01:14:06.013
Alright, sorry, sorry.

01:14:09.049 --> 01:14:10.951
You said there would be
a point when surgery...

01:14:10.951 --> 01:14:15.022
- might be an option.
- lf Charlotte agrees to it.

01:14:15.022 --> 01:14:18.959
Let's assume that she did. When
would this operation take place?

01:14:18.959 --> 01:14:22.029
When it's clear we're losing her.

01:14:24.965 --> 01:14:28.902
- Would you perform it?
- I am not a surgeon.

01:14:28.902 --> 01:14:32.940
The point is not finding someone
who's qualified.

01:14:32.973 --> 01:14:36.910
It痴 finding someone who's qualified
who is willing to do the operation.

01:15:05.005 --> 01:15:06.907
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:15:08.041 --> 01:15:09.977
- How are you? You okay?
- Yes.

01:15:09.977 --> 01:15:14.014
- How do you feel?
- Stoned.

01:15:15.048 --> 01:15:17.951
You're killing my hand.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:25.926
Charlotte, there's something I would
like to talk to you about.

01:15:26.994 --> 01:15:28.862
Don't. Heavy. No heavy.

01:15:28.929 --> 01:15:32.933
Sibley and I have been talking...
about surgery.

01:15:34.001 --> 01:15:36.870
About the paper you signed.

01:15:36.937 --> 01:15:40.941
No violins. Come on.

01:15:42.009 --> 01:15:43.977
I知 fine.

01:15:43.977 --> 01:15:46.914
Woody, you're the head of surgery...

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:50.017
if you can't help me, who can?

01:15:50.017 --> 01:15:54.922
Are you trying to tell me that in all
of Mt. Sinai, there is not one single...

01:15:55.089 --> 01:15:58.992
Yeah, Sibley told me that.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.930
The 30th. Yeah, fine... blank.

01:16:03.931 --> 01:16:08.001
Ok, when will the doctor be out
of surgery?

01:16:08.068 --> 01:16:12.973
This is urgent. I have a friend
who says she's one of the few doc...

01:16:12.973 --> 01:16:16.009
I知 sorry. Thank you.

01:16:17.978 --> 01:16:20.981
Please, I don't... speak German.

01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:23.917
Please, I'd like to speak to a doctor.

01:16:27.955 --> 01:16:29.890
Where's the doctor?

01:16:31.925 --> 01:16:36.897
He can't be in surgery for a week
and a half. No! You do not hang up!...

01:17:31.051 --> 01:17:33.954
She doesn't have long.

01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:38.926
- Weeks. Maybe less.
- And they can't do anything for her?

01:17:38.926 --> 01:17:43.897
No, her doctor says when
it's hopeless at the end...

01:17:44.932 --> 01:17:49.970
...surgery could be an option.
Heroic surgery, she calls it.

01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:54.942
That's why I知 out looking for someone
to make sure that when the times...

01:17:54.942 --> 01:17:59.980
comes, it's a hero that performs it.
I haven't found anybody yet though.

01:18:00.013 --> 01:18:03.917
I can't find anybody who's even
willing to attempt it. I will!

01:18:03.984 --> 01:18:07.988
I知 going to find someone
because I can't lose her.

01:18:08.021 --> 01:18:11.925
It won't happen.
She's too young.

01:18:23.036 --> 01:18:27.941
I知 sorry. I知 here,
but I have no right to be here.

01:18:36.016 --> 01:18:40.020
There's no excuse for
what I did to you, Lisa.

01:18:41.088 --> 01:18:44.024
You're my child.

01:18:45.058 --> 01:18:47.061
You needed me.

01:18:56.103 --> 01:18:58.005
I知 so sorry.

01:19:04.111 --> 01:19:09.016
I want to help you... find a surgeon.

01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:15.055
I知 a researcher. I can find anyone.
Even you.

01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:22.029
What do you want for Christmas?

01:19:22.162 --> 01:19:26.033
You can be really selfish
about this... anything you want.

01:19:28.068 --> 01:19:31.004
Or we can go somewhere... anywhere.

01:19:31.004 --> 01:19:34.975
I値l take you to Bali...
Timbuktu... Buffalo.

01:19:35.075 --> 01:19:38.011
Don't you have a restaurant to run?

01:19:41.048 --> 01:19:44.985
What's more important,
is what do you want for Christmas?

01:19:45.018 --> 01:19:47.020
No, you already gave me my present.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.056
I forgot. Did you like it?

01:19:51.091 --> 01:19:52.993
What was it again?

01:19:52.993 --> 01:19:57.064
Misery, heartbreak, pain...

01:19:57.064 --> 01:20:00.000
...happiness, love...

01:20:00.167 --> 01:20:05.072
- life.
- I remember now.

01:20:06.106 --> 01:20:09.009
What can I give you?

01:20:09.143 --> 01:20:12.079
More of this.

01:20:39.039 --> 01:20:42.076
- Yeah?
- I've got him.

01:20:42.076 --> 01:20:45.012
Oh Lisa, hold on, hold on.

01:20:45.012 --> 01:20:48.048
- Yeah, go ahead.
- His name is Tom Grandy.

01:20:48.048 --> 01:20:52.019
Harvard undergrad. He's at
the Cleveland Heart Institute.

01:20:52.019 --> 01:20:56.056
- Ohio?!
- It's one of the best in the world.

01:20:56.090 --> 01:21:01.028
He did his residency at Brigham,
cardiac surgery training at Cleveland.

01:21:01.028 --> 01:21:05.099
He takes the cases no one else will
touch. They say he's a miracle worker.

01:21:05.099 --> 01:21:09.036
He spends a lot of time traveling,
a lot of time lecturing.

01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:14.007
I got you an appointment today at 12:30.
Do not be late. He only has 15 minutes.

01:21:14.108 --> 01:21:18.078
The surgeon that recommended him said
if you can get him to take the case...

01:21:18.078 --> 01:21:22.015
...you know Charlotte's got a chance.
He hates the fail.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.028
- Mr. Keane?
- Yeah, hi.

01:21:35.095 --> 01:21:38.999
Thanks for a seeing me. I've got
everything that you asked for.

01:21:39.066 --> 01:21:43.070
Just once I'd like
to get sent something simple.

01:21:44.071 --> 01:21:49.042
That never happens anymore.
The downside of being good at my job.

01:21:49.042 --> 01:21:55.015
Good? My daughter was told
you were the best.

01:21:56.049 --> 01:22:00.087
Like most people,
I do the best can.

01:22:02.523 --> 01:22:06.074
Last time she passed out she regained
consciousness almost immediately.

01:22:06.094 --> 01:22:10.031
Next time, or the time after, she won't.
When that happens, call me.

01:22:11.098 --> 01:22:13.067
Room 17 is ready, Dr. Grandy.

01:22:13.133 --> 01:22:17.137
They'll reach me wherever I am.
I値l coordinate with Sibley.

01:22:17.137 --> 01:22:21.075
- I can't thank you enough. Thank you.
- I haven't done anything yet.

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:25.012
I知 home.

01:22:26.046 --> 01:22:28.082
Hello.

01:22:32.119 --> 01:22:34.054
There you are.

01:22:35.055 --> 01:22:39.026
- Where were you today?
- What do you mean?

01:22:40.127 --> 01:22:43.063
When you called,
I thought you were at work...

01:22:43.063 --> 01:22:45.999
then when I called you back, John
said you hadn't been in all day.

01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:50.070
I was in Montclair, New Jersey.

01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:53.107
- Why?
- An opportunity.

01:22:53.107 --> 01:22:56.043
Do you mean sexual or professional?

01:22:57.077 --> 01:22:59.079
Sexual.

01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:01.115
I mean, professional!

01:23:53.133 --> 01:23:57.037
You get it in there without breaking
it, I値l give you another 5 bucks.

01:23:57.071 --> 01:24:00.140
Six dollars... six of you.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:04.078
It痴 way too crowded.
I知 way too claustrophobic.

01:24:04.078 --> 01:24:08.148
- I値l take the next one.
- You sure? Okay... bye. Help.

01:24:12.186 --> 01:24:16.090
- You're going away for the holidays?
- I doubt it.

01:24:16.156 --> 01:24:19.193
- Did Mr. Keane enjoy his trip?
- What trip?

01:24:19.193 --> 01:24:22.963
- Just yesterday.
- I wouldn't call that a trip.

01:24:23.097 --> 01:24:29.069
I've never been to Ohio. It痴 amazing
how little I've seen of this country.

01:24:31.105 --> 01:24:35.042
Cool... I知 gonna
get me some hot chocolate...

01:24:44.051 --> 01:24:47.121
- Is it straight?
- Not straight.

01:24:48.122 --> 01:24:51.058
What were you doing in Ohio?

01:24:52.126 --> 01:24:56.029
I had a meeting with heart specialist.
He's willing to operate.

01:24:58.165 --> 01:25:02.102
That's exactly what
I didn't want you to do.

01:25:02.102 --> 01:25:05.038
You went behind my back.
You lied to me.

01:25:05.172 --> 01:25:08.108
- This what we talked about...
- Cut it out! Stop!

01:25:08.108 --> 01:25:10.110
No, we talked about that!

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:13.046
You do not want to die!
You want to live!

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:17.117
You think I haven't
been through this? So many times!

01:25:17.117 --> 01:25:21.088
I don't want to give people hope
when there isn't any.

01:25:21.188 --> 01:25:23.991
Why not? Maybe, we need hope.

01:25:24.124 --> 01:25:28.062
Maybe, I need to know that I've
done everything that I could do.

01:25:28.062 --> 01:25:29.997
lf I知 gonna...

01:26:34.061 --> 01:26:39.066
What would I do, Will
if you weren't here?

01:26:41.101 --> 01:26:45.072
Where would I be? Seriously?

01:26:47.141 --> 01:26:50.010
You'll never have
to worry about that.

01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:58.085
I値l do whatever I have to do.

01:26:59.119 --> 01:27:05.025
I値l tear up the papers. I値l tell
the doctors. Whatever you want.

01:27:10.164 --> 01:27:13.033
Cause I really want...

01:27:15.135 --> 01:27:18.105
I don't want to leave you.

01:27:20.207 --> 01:27:21.041
You know?

01:27:23.077 --> 01:27:26.013
No. No, no, no.

01:27:39.093 --> 01:27:42.029
- This is really good.
- What?

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:50.037
- This is much better than mine.
- No, you didn't!

01:27:50.137 --> 01:27:52.072
- Yeah, I did.
- Oh, God!

01:27:52.072 --> 01:27:55.109
- Forgeries!
- Yeah, a lot of them.

01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:58.045
Mine...yours...

01:28:19.133 --> 01:28:21.068
Will?

01:28:27.141 --> 01:28:29.076
Will?

01:28:31.211 --> 01:28:35.149
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing.

01:28:42.156 --> 01:28:46.093
Hey, no, no! Go back!
Give me another minute, alright?

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:11.151
- No, you're going to tire yourself out.
- This I've got to see!

01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:14.188
- Go back! Back!
- I can't believe it.

01:29:14.188 --> 01:29:17.124
Oh, my God!

01:29:19.259 --> 01:29:21.195
Alright. Almost.

01:29:21.195 --> 01:29:24.064
Hold on, hold on.

01:29:24.131 --> 01:29:29.136
Finishing up. Hold on now.
Just a second.

01:29:31.138 --> 01:29:36.143
Here we are. Okay! Alright.
Surprise!

01:30:01.235 --> 01:30:03.170
It痴 New York.

01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:05.139
This is Grandy.

01:31:39.233 --> 01:31:42.136
- You won't have long.
- All right.

01:32:18.238 --> 01:32:25.179
"Time cannot break...
the bird's wing from the bird."
