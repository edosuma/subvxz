I've always wanted to become

03:44.724 --> 03:47.602
who serves the country

03:47.685 --> 03:49.771
I was always told
to become a police officer

03:49.854 --> 03:50.939
since I always fought against injustice.

a police officer since you were little?

05:50.725 --> 05:54.937
You know, the top student of Yangmun High
who got into KNPU this year.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.064
Jang Juchan.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.901
He said he had two months
before the semester starts,

05:59.984 --> 06:02.028

-So who is that person?

07:33.786 --> 07:36.122
You said you applied for this school
because of a certain person.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.624
That person is...

07:39.417 --> 07:41.794
Professor Cha Yugon.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.379
(quirky music)

07:43.463 --> 07:46.507
That's right. After seeing him on

07:46.591 --> 07:48.676
the high-quality crime documentary,
<i>Unsolved Mysteries</i>,

07:48.759 --> 07:50.178
I thought to myself,

07:50.261 --> 07:54.182
"I want to be a warm-hearted
and cool-headed cop like him."

07:54.265 --> 07:55.600
So...

07:56.184 --> 07:57.643
I read his book too.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.561
(chuckles, exhales)

07:58.644 --> 08:00.480
After reading this book,

08:00.563 --> 08:03.858
I wanted to become his student
more desperately.

08:03.941 --> 08:07.653
Please give me a chance to learn
from my role model, Professor Cha.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.406
I'll be a great police officer!

08:11.574 --> 08:12.533
(chuckles)

08:12.617 --> 08:14.202
You're flattering me.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.162

08:16.245 --> 08:19.499

EUNKANG: <i>What's the problem?</i>

08:22.877 --> 08:24.921
The interview accounts
for five percent of the entire score.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.714
Of course, I had to suck up to him.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.967
Anyway, he loved it.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.386
You should have complimented
all the professors evenly.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.222
There were other professors too.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.140
The rest must have taken away
all the points you earned from him.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.018
No. As they say, "If you run
after two hares, you will catch neither."

08:39.101 --> 08:40.937
It's better to focus on one hare.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.941
You don't understand.
It was all strategically planned.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.361
All right. Well done.
Are you coming straight home?

08:48.444 --> 08:50.446

-FRIEND 1: I was so distressed then.
-FRIEND 2: Why?

09:35.908 --> 09:38.452
My mom's fortune teller said
I wouldn't get into college.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.247
Is that why you had the talisman
in your underwear on CSAT day?

09:41.330 --> 09:42.832
You're so superstitious.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.501
Dude. It was very expensive.
And it actually got me into the school.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.588
-You want to see it? I still have it.
-SEUNGHYUN: Gross, man.

09:48.671 --> 09:49.505

He's definitely going to get in.

Then you'll get in.

-FRIEND 4: What? Are you crazy?
-FRIEND 2: What's wrong?

10:01.559 --> 10:02.893
He canceled the savings account.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.229
He took out the money
from the savings for our backpacking trip.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.188
ALL: What?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.899
I just took mine out.
I'll join the next one.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.359
-Why?
-What is it?

10:10.776 --> 10:13.237
He needed the money
to get his girlfriend a designer bag.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.239
-FRIEND 1: Designer bag? You're crazy.
-FRIEND 3: What...

10:15.323 --> 10:17.158
-FRIEND 2: You're blinded by love.
-FRIEND 3: Damn it.

10:17.241 --> 10:20.578
-I'm sorry. The drinks are on me.
-No. Call your girlfriend.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.997
-Why?
-FRIEND 1: You got her an expensive bag,

10:23.080 --> 10:26.042
so she's got to at least
pay for the drinks.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.211
He's right. Call her.
And Seunghyun hasn't met her.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.963
She should come over
and say hi to him too.

10:31.047 --> 10:31.964
MINYONG: But...

10:32.048 --> 10:34.133
(munching)
I'm not interested in others' girlfriends.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.843
-FRIEND 4: Gosh, bit still...
-FRIEND 1: There he goes again.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.678
-FRIEND 2: Unbelievable.
-SEUNGHYUN: However,

10:37.803 --> 10:40.097
I'd love to see
who ruined our brotherhood.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.891
Well, she's really busy lately.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.559
-FRIEND 4: Come on. Call her.
-FRIEND 1: Geez.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.019
-FRIEND 1: We know she's pretty. Call her.
-FRIEND 2: Come on.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.647
-Is she pretty?
-FRIEND 2: Is she pretty? Let me see.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.607
SEUNGHYUN: How old is she?

10:50.274 --> 10:51.108
(suspenseful music)

10:51.233 --> 10:53.069
-FRIEND 1: Don't hide it. Let me see.
-SEUNGHYUN: How old is she?

10:53.194 --> 10:54.695
-(laughing)
-FRIEND 4: Is it her? Let me see.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.405

10:57.406 --> 11:00.743

This is why you hurried me.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.988
Yes, coming!

11:38.614 --> 11:40.825
What am I supposed to do?
The part-timer didn't show up.

11:40.908 --> 11:43.119
Still, you would make me,
a high school senior, go on a delivery?

11:43.202 --> 11:46.706
Mom, I'm taking the CSAT soon.
Every second is precious to me.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.375
You should be more nervous.
What if I don't get accepted?

11:49.458 --> 11:52.294
I am nervous. I really am.
Come on. You'll get accepted. Don't worry.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.505
-But...
-Come on. Go. Hurry.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.423
-Gosh!
-Hurry up!

11:55.506 --> 11:58.175
-Excuse me. One beer, please.
-All right!

12:00.261 --> 12:02.805
Why do you always make me work
when Mikang is just idling?

12:03.556 --> 12:04.390
(grumbles)

12:05.266 --> 12:07.727
HEESOOK: Gosh.
You think being a high school senior

12:07.810 --> 12:09.520

12:11.731 --> 12:13.190
It was fun, wasn't it?

12:14.066 --> 12:17.027
-I'm hungry. Let's grab something to eat.
-MIKANG: Okay.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.489
(thrilling music)

12:32.293 --> 12:33.377
(doorbell chimes)

12:33.461 --> 12:35.504
(thrilling music continues)

12:40.009 --> 12:41.218
(door lock clicks open)

12:41.635 --> 12:43.679
(chuckles)
How much is it?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.055
Hello.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.893
(chuckles)
I thought it was pizza delivery.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.936
We're looking for a person.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.356
(chuckles)
I see.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.108
-Weird.
-Wait.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.276
Wait. One second!

12:57.359 --> 12:58.736
MIKANG: Honey, what's up?

12:58.861 --> 13:00.905
MAN: There are some crazy guys outside.
One second.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.200
What the...

13:06.702 --> 13:08.454
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

13:09.246 --> 13:10.372
Get off me!

13:11.499 --> 13:12.333
Mikang!

13:16.086 --> 13:17.046
(scoffs)

13:17.129 --> 13:19.131
(emotive music)

13:20.674 --> 13:21.675
(sighs)

13:22.468 --> 13:23.385
(thuds)

13:24.386 --> 13:25.638
What is it?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.313
Let go!

13:34.897 --> 13:38.025
-We broke up last week.
-I thought you were just kidding.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.319
MINYONG: How could you...
It's only been a week.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.948
Mikang. Don't tell me
you were two-timing me.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.366
(Mikang stammers)
What?

13:46.283 --> 13:48.244
(exhales)
Let's talk later.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.789
No. You should apologize now
if you were actually two-timing him.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.124
Move. It's none of your business.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.252
I can't until you apologize.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.796
-Then I'll call the police.
-What?

13:58.879 --> 14:02.216
Because I'm feeling threatened right now.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.133
(scoffs)

14:03.217 --> 14:05.719
You seem to be
relying on the public authority.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.514
But that's for good moral people
who have a conscience.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.267
Not for a shameless person like you.
That would be wasting taxes.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.643
So don't abuse it.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.186
MINYONG: Hey, stop it.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.938
Stop what? You idiot.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.649
She was just taking advantage of you.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.943
That gold digger
was just playing with you.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.611
-(crowd murmurs)
-SEUNGHYUN: Get a hold of yourself!

14:22.695 --> 14:23.904
-WOMAN: What's going on?
-Hey!

14:24.488 --> 14:25.698
MIKANG: Eunkang.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.867
What did you just say?

14:28.409 --> 14:31.370
-What did you just call my sister?
-A gold digger.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.706
(snickers)
How rude of you!

14:33.789 --> 14:35.541
What else should I call her?

14:35.624 --> 14:39.128
She broke up with my friend three days
after receiving a five million won bag.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.131
And she was two-timing him too.
My friend isn't a sucker.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.091
You're free to move on
but have some manners.

14:44.174 --> 14:47.720
If you were going to break up with him,
why did you accept the present? So cheap.

14:49.597 --> 14:50.723
It was a birthday present...

14:51.307 --> 14:53.017
EUNKANG: <i>Gosh. So you did accept it.</i>

14:53.100 --> 14:54.101
(crowd murmuring)

14:54.184 --> 14:56.103
Well, she accepted it
because he gave it to her.

14:56.186 --> 14:59.940
It was for his sake.
It would have been rude to refuse it.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.109
(gasps, clears throat)

15:02.526 --> 15:05.195
Tell me.
Did she ever ask you to buy her this?

15:05.821 --> 15:07.489
No.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.199
Not at all.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.244
I swear. I bought it
because I wanted to. I mean it.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.164
You heard him. Looks like he was
just trying too hard to impress her,

15:15.247 --> 15:16.749
which she never asked for.

15:16.832 --> 15:20.878
If you don't know what happened,
don't go accusing an innocent person.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.546
My sister isn't a pushover.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.508
Mikang, give him back
everything you got from him.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.302
This is so lame.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.595
No, no.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.348
That would make me feel bad.
You don't need to do that.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.265
Hey.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.101
She'll send every single thing
you gave her,

15:36.185 --> 15:37.645
so don't ever contact her again.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.356
Don't even be around our house.
If we ever see you around,

15:40.439 --> 15:41.941
we'll report you to the police.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.108
As if he wants to.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.402
My friend will never want to see
your sister again either.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.447
EUNKANG: Great. I guess we won't have
to see each other again then.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.574
Well, bye then. Let's go.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.659
Hurry up.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.243
(crowd murmuring)

15:55.162 --> 15:56.288
MAN: Where are you going?

15:58.874 --> 16:00.960
(scoffs)
Were you two-timing me?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.463
No.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.465
-I told you already--
-Yes, you were!

16:06.548 --> 16:09.259
Gosh. Why do you have to yell at me?

16:09.343 --> 16:10.260
Follow me.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.345
(crowd murmuring)

16:11.428 --> 16:12.972
-EUNKANG: Wait.
-MIKANG: Let go of me.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.098
EUNKANG: Excuse me.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.809
Geez. What's your problem?

16:16.892 --> 16:17.893
-Who are you?
-(groans)

16:18.477 --> 16:20.479
MAN: Answer me. What do you want?

16:21.063 --> 16:21.939
(Eunkang shrieks)

16:22.314 --> 16:23.983
-(man grunts)
-(crowd exclaiming)

16:24.942 --> 16:26.610
There's no need to use violence.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.863
-You don't like this either, do you?
-Hey! Let go of me.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.824
Let her go first. Then I'll let you go.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.201
(tense music)

16:35.995 --> 16:37.955
MAN: You know this woman is a two-timer.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.249
I do, but that doesn't mean
I'm okay with your violence.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.500
Because this is wrong.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.168
Pulling one's hand is violence too.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.338
What? Violence? You little...

16:46.797 --> 16:49.341
MAN: Violence? Why you...
Do you have more to say?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.010
This is just unbelievable. Hey.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.970
-MINYONG: Let go and we'll talk it out.
-EUNKANG: Come on!

16:53.053 --> 16:54.221
MINYONG: Please let go of him.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.931
Let go already, will you?

16:56.932 --> 16:58.809
-Hey. You...
-"Hey"? Did you say "Hey"?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.065
(comical music)

17:12.156 --> 17:12.990
(door closes)

17:14.700 --> 17:16.618
You're such a disgrace to our family.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.872
I wasn't two-timing him.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.624
I'm not that kind of person.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.628
You could have waited a bit
before seeing another guy.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.672
How could you start a new relationship
only after one week?

17:28.756 --> 17:29.798
You're such a sleaze.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.219
-Sit.
-Just say it.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.304
Sit down.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.221
(sighs)

17:38.682 --> 17:41.393
When two people click,

17:41.477 --> 17:44.855
they can be best friends
and even lovers in a single day.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.317
Love is about depth, not length.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.861
So love while you can.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.863
You only live once.
You don't want regrets later.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.865
You drive me nuts.

17:54.948 --> 17:55.949
EUNKANG: Geez.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.913
Anyway, give him back
everything you got from him. Okay?

18:03.540 --> 18:04.458
Answer me.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.127
I'm not the only one who got presents.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.630
I gave him a designer wallet
on his birthday too.

18:09.713 --> 18:13.300
-We gave presents to each other.
-The prices are different.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.260
Have a conscience, will you?

18:18.555 --> 18:19.932
Where's my answer?

18:21.433 --> 18:23.852
-Fine.
-You have to send them back. Okay?

18:23.936 --> 18:24.978
I'm going to check later.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.857
Where did you even get the money
to buy a wallet...

18:29.316 --> 18:30.442
(thrilling music)

18:30.526 --> 18:31.610
(inhales)

18:36.532 --> 18:38.867
You... No, you didn't.
(chuckles)

18:39.785 --> 18:41.995
(dramatic music)

18:43.664 --> 18:45.207
(Eunkang screaming)
Hey!

18:45.999 --> 18:47.501
-Hey!
-What?

18:47.584 --> 18:48.585
Hey!

18:49.962 --> 18:51.130
Come here!

18:51.213 --> 18:52.548
Calm down, Eunkang.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.509
Please, Eunkang. Calm down.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.386
"Calm down", my foot!

18:57.469 --> 18:58.720
Calm down!

18:58.804 --> 19:00.597
How could you! You're just...

19:00.722 --> 19:02.099
-Hey!
-It's me, your sister.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.226
-You're so dead!
-Come on. Calm down.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.436
-Calm down!
-Give me my money back!

19:06.520 --> 19:08.564
-Damn it!
-Just calm down!

19:08.647 --> 19:10.774
(slow quirky music)

19:14.778 --> 19:16.655
(inaudible)

19:20.826 --> 19:22.911
(slow quirky music continues)

19:30.252 --> 19:31.336
(sighs)

19:32.171 --> 19:34.506
Come on. Say sorry to Mikang.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.801
It's her fault.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.469
She took my money.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.014
I get it! But still,

19:42.514 --> 19:45.392
how could you
beat up your own sister like this?

19:45.475 --> 19:47.936
Does money matter more than your family?

19:48.478 --> 19:51.106
We have really got to do
something about her temper.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.400
We've been nice to you
so you can focus on your study.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.360
(chomping)
And this is how you repay us?

19:55.444 --> 19:57.571
Come on. Say sorry to Mikang.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.490
-Why am I the only one being scolded?
-Who else should I scold then?

20:00.574 --> 20:03.202
Why do I have to say sorry
when she's the one at fault?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.037
You always take her side
because she's sick.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.789
I'm not that strong either.
(sobbing)

20:08.540 --> 20:11.501
And you always make me go on deliveries.
(whimpers)

20:11.585 --> 20:13.086
-(sniffles)
-YANGCHUL: Ko Eunkang!

20:13.170 --> 20:14.421
(utensils clang)

20:15.464 --> 20:16.423
(chomping)
Stop yapping.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.552
How dare you talk back like that?
Have some respect for your mom!

20:21.386 --> 20:24.514
-(sighs)
-Gosh. What is wrong with her?

20:24.598 --> 20:27.142
What do you think you are, a fighter?

20:28.644 --> 20:29.519
Geez.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.772
(chomping)

20:32.272 --> 20:34.983
YANGCHUL: Oh, my. How scary. Geez.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.109
HEESOOK: Ko Eunkang!

20:38.237 --> 20:39.404
There's nothing wrong with me.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.531
I'm the sweetest
if no one gets under my skin.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.243
It's amazing that
I grew to be such a positive person

20:44.326 --> 20:45.619
in such a horrible environment.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.830
As soon as I get into college,
I'm going to move out of that house.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.541
And I won't even look back.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.169
-Goodness.
-What are you mumbling about?

20:55.420 --> 20:56.505
Hey.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.423
(chuckles)

20:59.258 --> 21:01.385
EUNKANG: Have you been staying
in the dorm?

21:01.468 --> 21:02.928
I haven't seen you in a while.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.555
JUCHAN: I was training
in a patrol division after the mid-terms.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.850
Right. How did the interview go?

21:09.393 --> 21:12.104
They asked me the exact questions
you shared with me.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.816
And the book helped a lot too.
Professor Cha's book.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.859
He was one of my interviewers.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.362
JUCHAN: Really? You were so lucky.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.781
EUNKANG: I'll treat you to dinner
if I get accepted.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.158
JUCHAN: No way. The dinner is on me.
Your job is to get in.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.076
(Eunkang chuckles)

21:26.618 --> 21:27.995
You're really odd.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.040
I thought it was a joke when you said
you wanted to come to my school.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.210
It was so bold of you
because your grades weren't good enough.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.256
It was only my math grades that were bad.
The rest were fine.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.340
Even my math...

21:40.841 --> 21:43.677
Anyway, I'm sure I'm the one
who made the biggest improvement last year

21:43.760 --> 21:44.928
in the entire school.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.180
EUNKANG: My teacher said it was a miracle.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.474
You have no idea how hard I tried.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.227
JUCHAN: All right. I'm really proud
of you. You're so dedicated.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.897
I guess I'm a bit book smart after all.

21:55.981 --> 21:56.898
No, you're not.

21:56.982 --> 21:57.816
(gasps)

21:58.734 --> 21:59.568
(chuckles)

22:00.235 --> 22:01.653
(dogs barking in distance)

22:02.863 --> 22:05.324
JUCHAN: You know the CSAT score takes up
50% of the entire score.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.993
-Keep your guard up until the end.
-I will.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.122
Here.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.416
(gasps)

22:14.875 --> 22:16.001
What's...

22:16.668 --> 22:17.586
(chuckles)

22:18.503 --> 22:19.338
(breathes heavily)

22:24.676 --> 22:27.804
PASS

22:27.888 --> 22:29.639
(upbeat music)

22:29.723 --> 22:30.974
They're "pass" candies.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.769
I hope you pass the exam.
So we can study together.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.021
Study...

22:37.564 --> 22:38.857
together?
(chuckles)

22:39.149 --> 22:41.526
-Head on in. I'm off.
-Bye.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.412

22:56.375 --> 22:58.335

23:27.656 --> 23:28.573
(music fades)

23:29.616 --> 23:30.992
(plastic rustles)

23:36.873 --> 23:39.793
-What is it?
-Minyong told me not to send it back.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.129
-See.
-Mikang.

23:42.796 --> 23:45.424
I'm going to be a police officer
once I get into KNPU.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.717
And police represent integrity.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.388
So how can I keep
such an unrighteous item at home?

23:52.639 --> 23:53.473
(grumbles)

23:53.557 --> 23:55.142
You better pass everything
before saying that.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.727
Just wait a while.
The results will be announced in two days.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.147
Seriously? Gold digger?

24:01.231 --> 24:04.901
I'm going to send it back
and make his friend apologize.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.071
Damn it. That idiot.

24:10.490 --> 24:12.242

Gosh, I can't watch.
What if she didn't get in?

24:20.667 --> 24:22.794
(screaming)
Hey! Watch your mouth.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.963
What? I'm just scared.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.756
Quiet. It's almost time.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.217

24:29.634 --> 24:30.719
-Four.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.055
One!

24:35.098 --> 24:37.476
Today, we're going to talk
about the juvenile drug crime

24:37.559 --> 24:39.269
that happened in an arcade recently

24:39.352 --> 24:42.314
together with Mr. Wi Giyong,
Chief of East Gyeonggi Police Office.

24:42.397 --> 24:43.523
INSIDE NEWS LINE

24:43.607 --> 24:44.566
Hello, sir.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.151
Hello.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.695
You're the most
experienced expert in Korea

24:48.778 --> 24:51.072
when it comes to drug investigations.

24:51.156 --> 24:51.990
(laughs)

24:52.073 --> 24:53.617
ANCHORWOMAN: It's already been ten years

24:53.700 --> 24:57.913
since you revealed the connections between
a drug cartel and Damos Hotel in Gangnam

24:57.996 --> 24:59.664
as Captain of the drug squad,

24:59.748 --> 25:01.875
which created quite a stir back then.

25:02.417 --> 25:05.629
What do you think of this drug crime?

25:06.213 --> 25:08.173
-Well, that case--
-Excuse me.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.758
Sorry.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.135
-We need to take a small break here.
-Sure.

25:16.139 --> 25:18.058
-(clears throat)
-ANCHORWOMAN: We apologize, sir.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.352
-We know how busy you are.
-It's okay.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.645
(laughs, breathes deeply)

25:22.521 --> 25:25.315
WIFE

25:27.025 --> 25:30.070
SOOKJA: <i>He got... the highest score!</i>

25:30.612 --> 25:31.571
(chuckles)

25:32.614 --> 25:34.366
Didn't you see it yet?

25:34.449 --> 25:36.076
Someone already
posted an article about it.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.994
(sighs in awe)

25:38.078 --> 25:39.788
I'm so proud of my boy.

25:40.455 --> 25:43.083
Gosh, he's one handsome boy.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.459
Don't be so fussy.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.253
The score is meaningless.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.171
GIYONG: <i>What matters
is his performance there.</i>

25:48.797 --> 25:51.633
Come on.
A little compliment wouldn't hurt.

25:52.342 --> 25:56.721
He even dropped out of med school
to be a great cop like you.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.224
SOOKJA: <i>I still think it's a shame.</i>

25:59.683 --> 26:01.726
He's the one to make
his own decisions in life.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.479
You didn't say anything strange
to reporters, did you?

26:04.563 --> 26:07.232
Don't you worry.
I didn't say a word about you.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.233
Good.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.152
Once people find out
that his father is a high-ranking officer,

26:11.236 --> 26:14.030
-it's going to make things harder for him.
-SOOKJA: <i>Okay.</i>

26:14.114 --> 26:17.993
Honey, I was thinking
we could go out today,

26:18.076 --> 26:21.663
get him some new clothes
and have dinner together.

26:21.746 --> 26:22.998
When will you be finished?

26:23.081 --> 26:25.959
Do it without me.
We're having an emergency right now.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.043
-Honey--
-(cellphone beeps)

26:28.878 --> 26:30.213
(sighs)
Geez.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.426
He thinks he's the only one
protecting this country.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.469
(chuckles)

26:38.471 --> 26:39.306
(gasps)

26:39.889 --> 26:42.475
Are you already ready?

26:42.559 --> 26:45.395
Yes. Is he busy?

26:45.812 --> 26:50.942
Yes. But we can have
an intimate party of our own,

26:51.318 --> 26:52.652
just the two of us. Okay?

26:53.820 --> 26:56.698
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.491
(Yangchul yelps)

26:58.867 --> 27:00.368
YOUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN REJECTED

27:04.080 --> 27:06.458
-(somber music)
-I told you to watch your mouth.

27:06.541 --> 27:07.375
(clicks tongue)

27:07.792 --> 27:08.960
(sighs)

27:09.210 --> 27:10.712
HEESOOK: Why is it my fault?

27:16.635 --> 27:17.719
It's okay.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.477
YOUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN REJECTED

27:25.560 --> 27:27.646
(somber music)

27:34.152 --> 27:35.111

KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

TOWER OF JUSTICE

28:02.389 --> 28:03.723
HYUK: Attention!

28:04.557 --> 28:05.975
Parade rest!

28:06.643 --> 28:07.936
Attention!

28:08.395 --> 28:12.941
We will now begin Cheongram Education
for the trainees of Class 47.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.652
Cheongram Education
is an orientation program

28:15.735 --> 28:17.362
for the KNPU freshmen
before the semester begins.

28:17.445 --> 28:18.988
For the next two weeks,

28:19.072 --> 28:20.949
you will get basic physical training
and learn general knowledge.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.743
I hope you all can finish the course

28:23.827 --> 28:25.620
and proudly enter the school.

28:26.121 --> 28:26.955
Understood?

28:27.288 --> 28:28.373
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

28:28.456 --> 28:30.208
(Hyuk screaming)
Louder. Understood?

28:30.667 --> 28:32.502
(students screaming)
Yes, sir!

28:32.836 --> 28:35.338
All freshmen are required
to hand in their personal items

28:35.422 --> 28:36.923
and use the issued supplies.

28:37.006 --> 28:41.177
Using prohibited items like mobile phones
may lead to expulsion.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.930
So I want you all to be careful.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.181
Gi Hanna.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.809
(tense music)

28:47.892 --> 28:50.186
-INSIK: Next.
-Wi Seunghyun.

28:51.646 --> 28:53.440
(objects clattering)

28:53.523 --> 28:54.816
WI SEUNGHYUN
KNPU

29:06.411 --> 29:07.996
All right. I'm done.

29:08.079 --> 29:11.791
-Hand it in.
-I heard I could bring sneakers.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.127
-You think this is a fashion show?
-Oh...

29:16.087 --> 29:17.005
Then...

29:18.506 --> 29:20.133
-I'll take this and this.
-Choose one.

29:22.719 --> 29:23.678
SUNYU: Next.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.679
(bag thuds)

29:25.430 --> 29:26.389
(zipper zips)

29:28.099 --> 29:29.225
That's it?

29:30.435 --> 29:31.478
One second.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.688
SUNYU: Next.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.814
Yoo Daeil.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.319
INSIK: Freshman.

29:41.738 --> 29:42.739
What is that?

29:43.865 --> 29:44.699
(yelping)

29:45.909 --> 29:47.535
DAEIL: It's a cervical pillow.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.538
I have a forward head posture.

29:51.206 --> 29:54.125
You know how important it is
to keep the C curve on your neck.

29:54.417 --> 29:55.835
-Hand it in.
-Okay, sir.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.759
DAEIL: Guys, don't let them scare you.

30:02.842 --> 30:06.095
They're just overacting
to intimidate the naive freshmen.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.306
Just pretend to be scared.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.018
I heard many kids quit midway.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.646
Apparently over 20 freshmen
dropped out last year.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.397
(Daeil sighs)
Don't worry.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.150
Humans can adapt to any environment.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.069
It's all the same where people live.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.446
You seem relaxed.
Probably because you're older than us.

30:23.530 --> 30:24.948
Oh, come on.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.908
Just talk casually with me.
We're colleagues.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.618
BUMJU: But you're three years
older than me.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.577
(Daeil sucks air)

30:29.661 --> 30:30.662
Hey, Bumju.

30:30.745 --> 30:33.665
-If you keep doing that, I'll get angry.
-We're colleagues, so let's talk casually.

30:33.748 --> 30:35.333
-Or things will get complicated here.
-Maybe you're right.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.460
He's right. Say, "Hey."

30:37.544 --> 30:39.087
Hey. Hey.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.213
(Tak screaming)
Hey!

30:42.090 --> 30:43.216
Whose is this?

30:43.967 --> 30:44.926
That's mine.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.553
Why is it there?

30:48.763 --> 30:50.849
(tense music)

31:01.651 --> 31:02.735
You said it's yours.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.237
Sure, thanks.

31:04.737 --> 31:05.572
(zipper zips)

31:07.407 --> 31:08.825
Your name was Kim Tak, right?

31:08.908 --> 31:11.035
-I hope we get along.
-TAK: I'm going on ahead.

31:12.912 --> 31:13.746
(door opens)

31:17.000 --> 31:20.003
(Daeil sighs in annoyance)
Gosh. That little rat.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.297
So lastly, I'd like to say...

31:25.466 --> 31:29.178
since we met here as colleagues,
I hope we get along

31:29.262 --> 31:31.055
and make it to the end.

31:31.472 --> 31:34.809
Thanks. I'm Woo Juyoung.
Now, I'm done introducing myself.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.227
(applauding)

31:37.353 --> 31:39.939
But why did you come here
if you went to a science high school?

31:40.023 --> 31:43.067
I thought they would go
to schools like KAIST.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.613
Gosh, you know nothing, do you?

31:46.696 --> 31:49.949
What's the essence of
police investigations in this day and age?

31:50.033 --> 31:51.451
Forensic science.

31:51.993 --> 31:55.288
So I'm trying to make use
of my strong suit.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.040
Is that so?

31:57.123 --> 31:58.791
Good luck with that.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.377
(cheerful music)

32:01.461 --> 32:02.545
JUYOUNG : What about you?

32:02.962 --> 32:04.339
You're obviously from Seoul.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.132
I'm from Ilsan.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.885
My name is Jang Soyeon.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.012
SOYEON: My hobbies
are walking and reading.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.013
And I'm good at...

32:12.096 --> 32:14.182
Well, I guess I can say
I'm a good pianist.

32:14.766 --> 32:15.850
It's your turn now.

32:16.851 --> 32:17.894
I'm Gi Hanna.

32:18.978 --> 32:19.854
I'm from Gangneung.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.815
I love Gangneung.
I've been to Gyeongpodae there.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.944
Is that it?

32:27.195 --> 32:29.864
-Am I supposed to say more?
-Well...

32:30.448 --> 32:31.741
You don't have to.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.535
ARI: <i>Is she trying to be mysterious?</i>

32:35.203 --> 32:36.537
<i>How annoying.</i>

32:37.038 --> 32:37.914
Never mind.

32:38.581 --> 32:42.460
Is it my turn now? I'm...

32:43.127 --> 32:45.880
ARI: Actually, you probably know...

32:46.381 --> 32:49.008
JUYOUNG : Wait. Are you...

32:50.677 --> 32:51.594
You are! Right?

32:52.762 --> 32:55.932
That's right. I'm Shin Ari,
the <i>Golden Bell</i> star.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.266
Were you on TV?

32:57.892 --> 32:58.935
I thought you knew.

32:59.018 --> 33:02.021
No, I was going to ask
if you had double eyelid surgery.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.232
(scoffs)

33:04.315 --> 33:05.775
What are you talking about?

33:05.858 --> 33:08.319
Hey. Wait. You got a nose job too.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.654
No, I didn't!

33:09.737 --> 33:12.573
-Well, I can't believe that.
-I really didn't. Touch it.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.826
-ARI: Feel it.
-JUYOUNG : Where did you have eye surgery?

33:14.909 --> 33:16.953
The nose. Touch the nose.

33:17.036 --> 33:17.954
But your eyes...

33:18.037 --> 33:19.956
(chimes on speaker)

33:20.415 --> 33:23.876
SUNYU (on speaker):
<i>All freshmen, assemble now.</i>

33:24.210 --> 33:25.253
(footsteps approaching)

33:29.340 --> 33:32.051
(Hyuk screaming)
It took 20 minutes to get assembled!

33:32.593 --> 33:34.929
I'll let it slide
because this is your first day.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.681
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

33:36.848 --> 33:37.724
I'm the chief trainer,

33:37.807 --> 33:41.352
Um Hyuk, and I'll be training you
for the next two weeks.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.395
(weak applauding)

33:46.566 --> 33:48.776
From now on,
you're allowed to say only three things.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.654
"Yes, sir", "Sorry, sir",

33:51.738 --> 33:53.031
and "I'll get it right, sir."

33:53.573 --> 33:54.866
-Understood?
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.409
(screaming)
Is that all you got?

33:56.492 --> 33:58.077
(Students screaming)
Yes, sir!

33:58.161 --> 34:00.371
During this training period,
the student with top marks,

34:00.455 --> 34:03.207
Wi Seunghyun, will be
the representative of all you trainees.

34:03.541 --> 34:04.417
Yes, sir!

34:04.500 --> 34:06.169
-Wi Seunghyun, you're the mark.
-Mark!

34:06.252 --> 34:08.880
-Fall into eight lines!
-Yes, sir!

34:10.256 --> 34:11.674
(Hyuk shouting)
Get moving!

34:12.216 --> 34:13.426
COUNTRY, JUSTICE, HONOR

34:16.387 --> 34:19.557
HYUK: Now, we'll start
the basic physical training, the PT set.

34:19.724 --> 34:23.686
Until Cheongram Education is over,
your goal is a thousand PT sets a day.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.438
Understood?

34:25.521 --> 34:26.647
(screaming)
Do you understand?

34:26.731 --> 34:28.274
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

34:28.816 --> 34:30.109
(whistling)

34:30.777 --> 34:32.904
(upbeat rock music)

34:41.496 --> 34:42.705
Synchronize!

34:43.122 --> 34:44.373
HYUK: Another 100!

34:44.957 --> 34:46.417
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

34:47.960 --> 34:49.253
(whistling continues)

34:52.632 --> 34:53.800
HYUK: Move to the rhythm!

34:54.300 --> 34:56.094
Stay in line!

34:56.844 --> 34:58.471
Keep it in line!

34:58.554 --> 35:00.973
(upbeat music continues)

35:01.057 --> 35:02.767
(whistling continues)

35:05.269 --> 35:06.646
Get your act together!

35:09.148 --> 35:10.191
Stay alert!

35:10.817 --> 35:11.943
INSIK: Do it right!

35:12.026 --> 35:13.361
SUNYU: Keep moving!

35:13.945 --> 35:15.196
MALE TRAINER 1: Keep moving!

35:15.279 --> 35:17.782
-SUNYU: Eyes on the person in front.
-MALE TRAINER 1: Keep counting!

35:17.865 --> 35:19.200
HYUK: Don't stop!

35:19.283 --> 35:20.118
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

35:23.830 --> 35:25.998
(Hyuk screaming)
I told you to get your act together!

35:28.543 --> 35:30.253
That goalpost behind you.

35:30.711 --> 35:33.214
First ten to wrap around
and come back will pass. Move.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.465
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

35:34.841 --> 35:36.092
MALE TRAINER 2: Run now!

35:38.344 --> 35:39.804
INSIK: Run faster!

35:42.723 --> 35:44.100
(upbeat rock music continues)

35:46.060 --> 35:47.103
(all panting)

35:47.520 --> 35:48.521
(students grunting)

35:51.774 --> 35:52.608
(music stops)

35:52.692 --> 35:54.152
(students panting)

35:54.235 --> 35:55.403
COUNTRY, JUSTICE, HONOR

35:58.156 --> 35:59.657
-HYUK: Back to your positions.
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

35:59.740 --> 36:01.701
-HYUK: Back to your positions.
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

36:01.784 --> 36:04.120
HYUK: Same course excluding the first ten.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.831
The top 20 will pass this time. Move.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.040
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

36:15.590 --> 36:18.384
STUDENT DORMITORY

36:18.467 --> 36:19.427
(gargling)

36:19.844 --> 36:21.929
(speaker chimes)

36:22.013 --> 36:23.848
SUNYU: <i>This is an announcement
for freshmen.</i>

36:23.931 --> 36:26.267
Soon, there will be a roll call
at 10:00 p.m.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.770
Please get ready for the roll call.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.272
<i>I repeat.</i>

36:31.772 --> 36:34.817
<i>Soon, there will be a roll call
at 10:00 p.m.</i>

36:35.067 --> 36:38.237
<i>Please get ready for the roll call.</i>

36:39.197 --> 36:40.323
<i>I repeat.</i>

36:40.823 --> 36:43.701
<i>Soon, there will be a roll call
at 10:00 p.m.</i>

36:43.784 --> 36:47.121
<i>-Please get ready for the roll call.</i>
-Darn it.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.420
That wastebasket.
Is it supposed to be there?

36:55.379 --> 36:56.214
Uh...

36:58.007 --> 37:00.384
What is it doing here?

37:01.010 --> 37:03.137
Don't move the school's property.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.764
Yes, ma'am.

37:05.806 --> 37:07.808
(suspenseful music)

37:10.186 --> 37:11.687
Who's in charge of this area?

37:15.149 --> 37:16.025
I am.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.319
Did you wipe it down or not?

37:19.528 --> 37:20.988
I didn't wipe the outside...

37:21.072 --> 37:22.615
What are you mumbling about?

37:22.698 --> 37:24.659
I didn't know
I had to wipe the outside, so...

37:24.742 --> 37:26.244
SUNYU: Answer properly!

37:26.702 --> 37:28.037
I only wiped the inside!

37:32.333 --> 37:34.877
If you did it, say you did it.
If you didn't do it, say you didn't.

37:34.961 --> 37:38.798
-Don't you know how to answer?
-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll answer properly.

37:40.174 --> 37:42.301
-Clean it again.
-Yes, ma'am!

37:43.970 --> 37:46.222
(suspenseful music)

37:50.226 --> 37:51.686
(music stops)

37:53.980 --> 37:56.065
(footsteps thumping)

38:02.363 --> 38:04.699
(somber music)

38:05.366 --> 38:06.242
(groans)

38:07.827 --> 38:09.745
A close-order drill
trains you to carry out

38:09.829 --> 38:11.706
the commander's orders
quickly and correctly.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.667
HYUK: It plays an important role
in developing the basic police mentality.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.503
First, you'll learn about formations.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.380
Fall into five lines!

38:19.463 --> 38:21.674
Fall into five lines! Mark, one!

38:22.258 --> 38:23.175
-Two!
-Three!

38:23.259 --> 38:26.220
-Four!
-Five! End of order! Fall in!

38:26.304 --> 38:27.346
STUDENTS: Fall in!

38:28.055 --> 38:29.598
Fall into eight rows!

38:29.682 --> 38:32.018
Fall into eight rows! Mark, one!

38:32.101 --> 38:32.977
BOTH: Two!

38:33.144 --> 38:34.145
Get it together!

38:34.854 --> 38:36.647
HYUK: Forward, march!

38:36.731 --> 38:37.773
Left.

38:38.232 --> 38:39.233
Left.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.695
Change step, march!

38:44.155 --> 38:45.239
Come out!

38:45.990 --> 38:47.825
Get with it!

38:49.285 --> 38:51.412
STUDENTS: One, two.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.997
Stop frowning!

38:53.080 --> 38:54.457
STUDENTS: One, two.

38:54.540 --> 38:55.583
-STUDENTS: One, two.
-Do it right!

38:55.666 --> 38:56.792
-One, two.
-Faster!

38:56.876 --> 38:58.336
STUDENTS: One, two.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.754
INSIK: Get your act together!

39:00.546 --> 39:02.006
HYUK: Fall into four lines!

39:02.298 --> 39:04.175
TAK: Fall into four lines!

39:04.425 --> 39:05.760
-Mark!
-Two!

39:05.843 --> 39:07.345
-Three!
-Four!

39:10.473 --> 39:13.726
You're supposed to say,
"Four. End of order. Fall in"!

39:13.809 --> 39:14.769
Four! End of order!

39:14.852 --> 39:16.687
-"Fall in."
-Four! Fall in!

39:28.657 --> 39:31.285
"Four. End of order. Fall in."
Get it together!

39:31.369 --> 39:33.371
End of order. Fall in.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.956
-Louder.
-Four! Order! Fall in!

39:36.040 --> 39:36.874
Are you kidding me?

39:37.333 --> 39:38.709
-Again.
-Sorry, sir!

39:38.793 --> 39:40.961
-Again!
-Four! Order! Fall...

39:41.045 --> 39:43.214
-Four! Fall in! End!
-Again.

39:45.716 --> 39:46.842
-Are you crying?
-No, sir!

39:46.926 --> 39:48.094
-HYUK: Are you crying?
-SOYEON: No, sir!

39:48.177 --> 39:49.095
-HYUK: Are you crying?
-SOYEON: No, sir!

39:49.178 --> 39:51.555
-Again!
-Four! End of order!

39:52.056 --> 39:53.015
HYUK: Louder.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.226
SOYEON: End of order! Fall in!

39:58.104 --> 40:00.398
HYUK: The close-order drill
is the most basic training here.

40:00.481 --> 40:04.652
How can you be an executive officer
if you don't know the basics? You morons!

40:04.735 --> 40:06.612
STUDENTS: Sorry, sir!

40:06.695 --> 40:09.448
HYUK: Say "Let's" at one
and "concentrate" at two.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.991
Start doing 100 push-ups.

40:11.617 --> 40:13.202
-Go.
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

40:13.285 --> 40:15.246
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:15.329 --> 40:17.039
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.624
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:18.707 --> 40:20.251
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.836
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:21.919 --> 40:23.504
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:23.587 --> 40:24.547
HYUK: One.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.215
-STUDENTS: Let's...
-Let's.

40:26.298 --> 40:28.092
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.678
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:30.761 --> 40:32.555
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:32.638 --> 40:34.515
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:34.598 --> 40:36.350
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.352
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:38.436 --> 40:39.895
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.148
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:42.231 --> 40:44.191
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.734
INSIK: Three more left!

40:45.818 --> 40:48.070
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:48.154 --> 40:50.364
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.825
-HYUK: One.
-STUDENTS: Let's...

40:52.908 --> 40:54.618
-HYUK: Two.
-STUDENTS: ...concentrate.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.579
HYUK: Get up.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.706
(Students groaning, panting)

41:00.124 --> 41:02.668
Do you want the rest to do it
all over again just because of you?

41:03.043 --> 41:04.503
HYUK: Being a woman is not an excuse.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.881
If you want to act weak,
cut it out and go home.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.632
No, sir. I'll do it again.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.801
(Soyeon panting)

41:12.761 --> 41:15.222
Let's concentrate.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.808
SOYEON: Let's...

41:17.892 --> 41:18.893
(whimpers)
...concentrate.

41:19.602 --> 41:20.603
Let's

41:21.228 --> 41:22.354
...concentrate.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.522
(pants)

41:23.606 --> 41:24.440
Let's...

41:25.149 --> 41:26.192
(whimpers)
...concentrate.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.653
Let's concentrate.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.531
Let...

41:33.532 --> 41:34.992
(groans, panting)

41:36.994 --> 41:38.204
HYUK: Get up.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.831
(tense music)

41:43.626 --> 41:45.711
-Sorry, sir!
-Get up!

41:47.588 --> 41:49.298
KNPU freshman Wi Seunghyun.

41:51.133 --> 41:52.301
May I say something, sir?

41:53.761 --> 41:54.720
Go on.

41:54.803 --> 41:57.598
She doesn't seem to be feeling well.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.142
You. Get up.

42:01.393 --> 42:02.228
(groans)

42:02.937 --> 42:04.146
(breathes heavily)

42:08.692 --> 42:11.612
Are you not feeling well?
If you are, you'll be excused.

42:12.321 --> 42:13.322
Well...

42:14.281 --> 42:15.366
I'm not...

42:16.116 --> 42:18.744
-feeling...
-Answer properly.

42:21.288 --> 42:24.416
No, I'm feeling fine, sir. I can do it.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.547
(suspenseful music)

42:30.339 --> 42:31.257
Good.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.050
HYUK: Then do the rest.

42:34.134 --> 42:35.302
Yes, sir.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.096
(emotive music)

42:37.179 --> 42:38.305
SEUNGHYUN: Please stop, sir.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.269
How can she say yes...

42:44.144 --> 42:45.437
under this pressure?

42:46.939 --> 42:49.191
No one would be able to say
that they are unwell.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.277
(emotive music continues)

42:56.991 --> 42:58.617
What about this pressure?

42:59.910 --> 43:03.038
In case you didn't know,
you didn't come here to have fun.

43:03.122 --> 43:05.082
You came here to get training,
so you get training.

43:05.165 --> 43:06.792
Training is not an option.
It's an obligation.

43:06.875 --> 43:09.628
You have to do it even if you're tired,
sick, or you don't want to do it.

43:10.504 --> 43:14.425
Will you not help people in trouble
if you're feeling sick?

43:19.847 --> 43:21.181
Listen, all of you.

43:22.182 --> 43:24.727
After graduation,
you will all be executive police officers

43:24.810 --> 43:27.855
who will be responsible for
and serving the people's lives and safety.

43:27.938 --> 43:29.690
As executive officers,
you need to set an example.

43:29.773 --> 43:31.900
If you use your condition as an excuse,

43:32.693 --> 43:35.070
no one will follow your orders.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.449
If you're not confident,
I want you to come out right now.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.368
To weaklings, this place will be hell.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.288
They won't survive four years here anyway.

43:45.873 --> 43:49.418
Then who protects us when we're sick?

43:51.503 --> 43:53.797
(thrilling music)

44:05.017 --> 44:06.644
STUDENT DORMITORY

44:06.727 --> 44:08.228
DAEIL: <i>There are two possibilities.</i>

44:08.812 --> 44:11.231
Either his brain froze from
getting the punishment in the cold

44:11.315 --> 44:13.233
or his eyes froze
so he couldn't see anything.

44:13.776 --> 44:15.027
Can a brain freeze?

44:17.112 --> 44:19.990
I didn't mean that literally. Gosh.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.701
It means he didn't read the room
and crossed the line.

44:24.119 --> 44:26.455
I thought he was smart
because he got the highest score.

44:26.538 --> 44:29.124
His EQ must be low.
He can't seem to read the room.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.043
He wasn't wrong though.

44:32.419 --> 44:33.796
I thought it was satisfying.

44:33.879 --> 44:37.341
Hey, he should have known
who he was talking to.

44:37.966 --> 44:40.177
I mean, look at the trainer's face.

44:40.260 --> 44:41.804
That kind of villain

44:41.887 --> 44:44.431
crushes you even harder
when you try to fight back.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.392
You should never mess with them.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.771
Then Seunghyun is in trouble.
I think he got on the wrong side of him.

44:51.313 --> 44:54.274
That's not who you should worry about.

44:54.650 --> 44:56.819
-We aren't safe either.
-Why not?

44:57.403 --> 45:00.072
He won't only pick on Seunghyun.

45:00.656 --> 45:03.534
If he does, people might say
he's bullying him. Then what will he do?

45:04.284 --> 45:07.496
He'll punish Seunghyun
and the people around him.

45:07.579 --> 45:08.831
Do you know what that's called?

45:11.834 --> 45:13.711
Gosh. It's called joint responsibility.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.213
-(scrapes)
-(sighs)

45:17.089 --> 45:18.799
The moment he finds a speck of dust here,

45:19.174 --> 45:21.802
he'll crush us all. I'm sure of it.

45:23.762 --> 45:24.805
Darn it!

45:25.180 --> 45:28.183
Why do I have to be his roommate?
I don't want to be involved.

45:28.684 --> 45:30.853
Guys, keep your distance from Seunghyun.

45:31.437 --> 45:33.772
Something's ominous about him.

45:33.856 --> 45:36.650
(sighs)
Gosh, stop overreacting, okay?

45:36.900 --> 45:39.653
TAK: I find you more ominous.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.406
Me?

45:48.996 --> 45:50.289
Why do you think so?

45:51.081 --> 45:51.915
(sighs)

45:52.708 --> 45:53.709
Knock it off.

46:14.730 --> 46:16.273
HYUK: You asked who protected us.

46:16.356 --> 46:17.316
(dramatic music)

46:17.399 --> 46:18.817
We protect ourselves.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.903
That's why we train ourselves
to become stronger.

46:22.696 --> 46:25.699
But the training that disregards
individual differences can be harsh on--

46:25.783 --> 46:27.743
This is not a place
for individual education.

46:27.826 --> 46:29.328
Either you bear it or quit.

46:30.329 --> 46:31.663
Those are your only options.

46:33.081 --> 46:36.126
Isn't that common sense
for a police officer's son?

46:38.253 --> 46:40.881
Don't think you'll be protected
by your father.

46:44.092 --> 46:48.263
Whoever your father is,
no one can disrupt the training here.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.810
(dramatic music)

46:58.190 --> 47:00.067
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

47:08.742 --> 47:11.453
-Are you really leaving?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

47:12.204 --> 47:13.330
I didn't want to
make a big deal out of it.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.123
Couldn't you hang in there
a little longer?

47:15.207 --> 47:16.416
I mean, it's almost over.

47:16.500 --> 47:19.336
The trainers won't
keep acting like that after orientation.

47:19.419 --> 47:22.047
I only caused trouble to others.

47:23.465 --> 47:24.675
I'm sorry.

47:24.758 --> 47:25.926
(sighs)

47:26.260 --> 47:27.219
(chuckles)

47:32.015 --> 47:32.850
(Ari sighs)

47:33.642 --> 47:34.476
(Juyoung smack lips)

47:34.560 --> 47:35.561
ARI: Let's get back.

47:35.644 --> 47:36.562
JUYOUNG : Okay.

47:37.563 --> 47:38.397
(Juyoung sighs)

47:38.480 --> 47:39.314
(door opens)

47:40.649 --> 47:42.568
It must have been really tough.

47:43.193 --> 47:44.903
Hey, you were here.

47:44.987 --> 47:48.240
Soyeon just left.
You might be able to catch up if you run.

47:48.323 --> 47:50.284
-Yes.
-I'm good.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.327
We didn't talk that much anyway.

47:52.411 --> 47:53.495
(scoffs)

47:54.705 --> 47:57.332
She was still our roommate.
You should at least say goodbye.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.502
I don't want to be swayed by a quitter.

48:01.169 --> 48:04.172
Well, we're here,
and that's all that matters.

48:05.299 --> 48:06.258
(clears throat)

48:07.092 --> 48:08.051
(sighs)

48:08.135 --> 48:10.429
Who's going to use this bed then?

48:11.889 --> 48:14.558
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR GRADUATION

48:16.435 --> 48:18.395
They could have just sent it by post.

48:19.271 --> 48:21.440
What am I doing here?

48:22.024 --> 48:24.902
PUNGJIN GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
30TH GRADUATION CEREMONY

48:24.985 --> 48:27.195
(indistinct chattering)

48:31.283 --> 48:33.327
-Let's go!
-Let's have something nice today.

48:33.410 --> 48:34.786
-Really? Yay!
-Yes!

48:35.203 --> 48:36.705
Mom! I'm here.

48:37.164 --> 48:38.373
I told you to hurry.

48:38.957 --> 48:41.251
You could have told me
if you finished early.

48:41.335 --> 48:43.295
-Eunkang!
-There you go again, talking back to me.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.673
There she is. Eunkang!

48:46.757 --> 48:48.216
HEESOOK: Sweetie.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.385
See? This is why I said we should hurry.

48:50.469 --> 48:53.013
I'm sorry we're late.
Congratulations on graduating.

48:55.766 --> 48:57.809
Eunkang, let's take a photo together.

48:57.893 --> 49:00.812
A photo? We don't have to.

49:01.313 --> 49:03.523
Come on. To celebrate your graduation.

49:03.607 --> 49:06.693
Why the long face?
Is it because you didn't get accepted?

49:06.777 --> 49:09.947
-Try again next year.
-YANGCHUL: She's right. College?

49:10.030 --> 49:12.157
It can wait a year. What's the big deal?

49:12.240 --> 49:14.701
You weren't just lucky enough this time.
Your time will come.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.578
-Chin up!
-Yes.

49:16.662 --> 49:19.456
-All right. Let's take a photo.
-Yes. Chin up.

49:19.539 --> 49:20.958
-Come on.
-A photo?

49:21.875 --> 49:23.460
Look here. Here we go.

49:24.336 --> 49:26.880
In three, two...

49:26.964 --> 49:27.798
(cellphone vibrates)

49:27.881 --> 49:29.633
-Hang on.
-What is it?

49:29.716 --> 49:30.801
I got a call.

49:30.884 --> 49:32.260
-A call?
-Yes.

49:34.388 --> 49:37.307
-Hello?
-STAFF: <i>Is this Ms. Ko Eunkang's phone?</i>

49:37.391 --> 49:38.684
Yes. That's me.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.143
<i>This is KNPU.</i>

49:40.560 --> 49:42.312
-What?
-<i>We have an extra spot and you got in.</i>

49:42.396 --> 49:43.855
<i>Can you enroll by tomorrow?</i>

49:44.690 --> 49:47.526
(stammers)
Okay. I will.

49:49.945 --> 49:50.779
(cellphone beeps)

49:50.862 --> 49:52.906
(thrilling music)

49:53.699 --> 49:54.783
What is it?

49:56.743 --> 49:58.829
(screams)

50:02.499 --> 50:03.500
(laughing)

50:03.583 --> 50:04.876
Why? What is it?

50:04.960 --> 50:06.086
What is it?

50:06.169 --> 50:08.296
I got accepted!

50:08.755 --> 50:10.716
(all laughing)

50:13.093 --> 50:15.137
I got in!

50:40.120 --> 50:41.038
(door thuds)

50:43.415 --> 50:45.208
Use the empty bed.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.627
The other students are training now,

50:47.753 --> 50:50.464
so if you have any questions,
ask your roommates when they come back.

50:54.593 --> 50:58.180
After lunch, you should join
the afternoon training.

50:59.139 --> 51:00.140
Yes, ma'am.

51:06.772 --> 51:08.857

52:35.277 --> 52:37.737
<i>I thought I wasn't accepted into college,</i>

52:37.821 --> 52:39.447
<i>but the next day, I got in like a miracle.</i>

52:40.157 --> 52:41.575
<i>What did you just say?</i>

52:42.159 --> 52:44.286
What did you just call my sister?

A gold digger.

you'd never see again.</i>

52:54.004 --> 52:55.130
<i>As if...</i>

52:56.131 --> 52:57.299
<i>it was destiny.</i>

52:59.050 --> 53:00.719
<i>But I didn't know then</i>

53:01.511 --> 53:05.098
<i>that it was just the beginning of my 20s,
which turned out to be...</i>

53:05.765 --> 53:07.559
<i>like a roller coaster ride.</i>
