00:01.000 --> 00:02.656
- Alexa, are we friends?
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:02.680 --> 00:04.496
<i>She said you haven't been sleeping.</i>

00:04.520 --> 00:05.556
<i>You need your rest.</i>

00:08.160 --> 00:09.320
<i>You still hiding them?</i>

00:09.360 --> 00:12.000
<i>In this day and age,
it's sicker not having panic attacks.</i>

00:12.080 --> 00:13.230
Fuck!

00:13.520 --> 00:15.955
Wow. I've never touched
something so beautiful.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.554
I feel the same way each time.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.536
<i>Can't we just be
a normal couple that looks up</i>

00:19.560 --> 00:21.756
vacation packages to
Budapest?

00:21.840 --> 00:23.194
Just so you know...

00:23.280 --> 00:24.430
<i>...full-time freelance now.</i>

00:24.520 --> 00:26.432
<i>Only loyalty is to
the almighty paper.</i>

00:26.520 --> 00:29.558
<i>I want you to destroy
Whiterose's machine.</i>

00:29.680 --> 00:31.592
Everything you need to know
is on here.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.114
You can't make
your own currency.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.112
That is the federal
government's job.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.476
With Ecoin equal
to one dollar,

00:37.560 --> 00:39.313
<i>we are the authority.</i>

00:39.400 --> 00:41.240
You know that night
we spent together?

00:41.400 --> 00:42.576
<i>This is why you came here.</i>

00:42.600 --> 00:43.600
You were just using me.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.000
You know it was
more than that.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.875
I am not
leaving you like this.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.189
You wanna help me?

00:49.280 --> 00:50.475
This is all my fault.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.560
Then take them down.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.176
<i>The data
dump from fsociety</i>

00:56.200 --> 00:57.395
<i>was easily the largest</i>

00:57.480 --> 01:00.439
<i>and most damning doxxing case
in history.</i>

01:00.520 --> 01:02.910
<i>While only a small percentage
of the documents in the breach</i>

01:03.040 --> 01:04.793
<i>have been substantiated at
this time,</i>

01:05.040 --> 01:08.078
<i>those that have
are proving to be accurate.</i>

01:08.200 --> 01:09.320
<i>With regard to their source,</i>

01:09.360 --> 01:11.238
<i>the intelligence community
is cautioning</i>

01:11.320 --> 01:13.357
<i>the overall veracity of
the data dump</i>

01:13.440 --> 01:14.999
<i>and rush to judgment,</i>

01:15.080 --> 01:16.296
<i>citing fears of falsified
documents...</i>

01:16.320 --> 01:17.976
...and then your
one-K letter to the FBI

01:18.000 --> 01:19.912
will be issued
by the US Attorney's office,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.480
once everything you've told us

01:21.600 --> 01:24.115
and what you've logged in here
checks out.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.879
Now, I do need to mention

01:26.960 --> 01:29.873
these are some serious crimes
you've committed, Agent DiPierro.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.376
You may come out of this
with a record.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.880
There's not much
we can do about that.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.136
<i>... China's Minister
of State Security</i>

01:34.160 --> 01:35.799
<i>has been exposed as the</i>

01:35.880 --> 01:38.634
<i>infamous hacker and
leader of the Dark Army,</i>

01:38.720 --> 01:40.518
<i>known only as Whiterose.</i>

01:40.960 --> 01:42.758
<i>Intelligence officials who
have long sought</i>

01:42.840 --> 01:44.160
<i>Whiterose's identity...</i>

01:44.240 --> 01:45.674
Those dresses he showed me...

01:45.880 --> 01:47.600
<i>...the Deus Papers
were the key</i>

01:47.640 --> 01:49.313
<i>to confirming
Zhang's double-life.</i>

01:50.200 --> 01:51.919
He was trying to tell me
who he was.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.136
<i>...saying it was
the missing link</i>

01:54.160 --> 01:55.230
<i>that finally allowed them</i>

01:55.320 --> 01:56.720
<i>to connect Whiterose and...</i>

01:56.800 --> 01:58.136
I'm sorry,
who are you referring to?

01:58.160 --> 02:01.392
<i>...unsolved cold cases,
some that reach back decades.</i>

02:01.480 --> 02:03.456
<i>China has yet to officially
respond to the claims...</i>

02:03.480 --> 02:04.516
Nothing.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.176
<i>...of their Minister of
State Security's involvement</i>

02:06.200 --> 02:08.715
<i>in either the Deus Group
or the Dark Army...</i>

02:08.800 --> 02:10.015
As for your job
with the Bureau,

02:10.039 --> 02:11.576
you're on administrative leave
for six months

02:11.600 --> 02:12.750
until OPR does their thing.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.840
What's in the bag?

02:15.040 --> 02:16.076
Oh, um.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.355
This is saline.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.216
We'll be putting some medicine
in there, so you can get some rest...

02:19.240 --> 02:20.276
No.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.394
No drugs.
I don't want any drugs.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.080
I'm gonna leave soon anyway.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.117
Oh, sweetie, you can't
leave here anytime soon.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.960
She's right, Dom.
You need to stay put.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.776
Plus, with everything
going on out there,

02:31.800 --> 02:33.400
we don't think you should
go home anyway.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.955
I'm not going home,
I need to see my family.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.320
They're in one of our
safe houses, Dom.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.315
SO4's watching 'em,
24/7 rotation.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.551
I need to see them for myself.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.216
<i>...have already issued
a joint statement on...</i>

02:46.240 --> 02:47.560
Um...

02:47.640 --> 02:48.869
That can't happen.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.776
The heck is that
supposed to mean?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.360
They're my family,
I should be able to see them.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.478
It's like I said,
until OPR clears you...

02:57.560 --> 02:58.596
I'm not cleared?

02:58.840 --> 03:01.719
<i>... World Bank, WPO
and the US Federal Reserve</i>

03:01.800 --> 03:04.554
<i>are still trying
to piece together the event.</i>

03:04.640 --> 03:06.916
<i>Reports continue to come in
from around the globe</i>

03:07.040 --> 03:08.759
<i>about the far-reaching
cyber-heist...</i>

03:08.840 --> 03:09.876
I can't believe this.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.912
<i>Thus far, the confirmed
victims of the robbery</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:14.037
<i>include prominent
businessmen, CEOs...</i>

03:14.120 --> 03:16.954
You don't trust me to know
where my own family is?

03:17.040 --> 03:18.776
<i>...all of whom are believed
to be affiliated...</i>

03:18.800 --> 03:20.359
Not now, no.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.791
<i>Officials believe the
compromised Deus Group accounts</i>

03:22.920 --> 03:25.116
<i>were managed by Cyprus
National Bank,</i>

03:25.200 --> 03:27.715
<i>who is thought to be
at the center of the hack.</i>

03:28.360 --> 03:29.840
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.896
All you need to
worry about right now

03:32.920 --> 03:34.160
is getting a good
night's sleep.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.711
This hospital's gonna take
great care of you, okay?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.256
Now, make sure
she gets whatever she needs.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.717
<i>The Deus Group lost trillions
of dollars in the cyberattack.</i>

03:41.800 --> 03:44.156
<i>Law enforcement authorities
suspect fsociety</i>

03:44.240 --> 03:45.754
<i>to be the architect
of the heist...</i>

03:45.840 --> 03:48.833
- Can I get you anything before I go?
- I wanna go home.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.190
Pardon me?

03:51.280 --> 03:52.430
I have to go home.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.639
Sweetheart, it's like I said earlier,
the doctor isn't recommending...

03:55.720 --> 03:57.677
The doctor said
the surgery went great.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.230
Right?

04:00.120 --> 04:01.856
And I'm able to walk around
just fine as long

04:01.880 --> 04:03.314
as I don't tear my stitches.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.792
You can't legally keep me here
if I wanna leave.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.834
Yes, we can discharge you
against medical advice, but...

04:11.920 --> 04:12.920
That's what I want.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.719
<i>The NYPD has officially...</i>

04:18.440 --> 04:20.954
I really appreciate this,
but I don't need this wheelchair.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.111
Hospital policy, ma'am.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.755
- Did the nurse call your pick-up contact?
- What?

04:25.840 --> 04:26.840
Who's picking you up?

04:27.440 --> 04:29.591
- Nobody's picking me up.
- What's that?

04:29.680 --> 04:30.875
I'm just gonna grab a cab.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.190
- You can't do that, ma'am.
- Why not?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.356
Since the hospital
administered anesthesia,

04:37.440 --> 04:39.272
you have to have
somebody with you.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.511
Can't just put you in a cab
with a stranger.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.917
You sure
there's nobody you can call?

04:46.280 --> 04:47.475
A friend, a family member...

04:47.560 --> 04:48.596
No.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.193
I don't have anyone.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.376
What about one of those
FBI guys that was here earlier?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.640
I could give
one of them a call.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.040
Definitely not.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.877
Aight. I'm gonna check

05:03.960 --> 05:05.758
the social services
volunteer list,

05:05.840 --> 05:07.638
and see who we have
available today.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.518
It'll just take a sec.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.717
Hang tight, I'll be back.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.473
This is ridiculous,
I told you I'm good...

05:14.560 --> 05:16.040
Can I trust you to behave,

05:16.120 --> 05:18.589
or do we need to bring
security over here?

06:38.560 --> 06:40.720
Come on, open up.
We don't have a lot of time.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.672
What the fuck
is going on here?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.396
Don't worry about that, we're not staying.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.954
You shouldn't
even be here.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.593
When I...
It took me forever

07:09.680 --> 07:11.080
to find what hospital
you were at,

07:11.280 --> 07:12.839
and when I found out you went
home...

07:12.920 --> 07:14.120
Want a grilled
cheese sandwich?

07:18.080 --> 07:19.309
Why are you even here?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.038
Shouldn't you still
be at the hospital?

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
Probably.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.800
Figured not the
safest place to be,

07:26.880 --> 07:27.916
given what you guys did.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.236
Saw the news, guess you really
pulled it off.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.312
Which is why we need to
get the fuck out of here.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.199
Elliot and I have
a getaway plan lined up,

07:37.280 --> 07:39.256
and I think it'd be in your
best interest to come with us.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.600
I'm not going anywhere.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.480
Dom, you cannot
stay here.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.960
Best bet is
to leave with us

07:47.040 --> 07:48.520
until this whole thing
blows over.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.360
I have to stay here until

07:50.440 --> 07:51.999
the OPR investigation
clears my name.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.514
Who gives a shit
about that?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.239
- I do.
- Why?

07:55.920 --> 07:57.639
Because then I can see
my family again.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.033
Then I can finally
apologize to them

08:00.120 --> 08:01.839
for everything
I put them through.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.154
Alexa,
play some Faith Hill.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.357
<i>Shuffling songs
by Faith Hill.</i>

08:21.720 --> 08:22.896
I can't remember
the last time

08:22.920 --> 08:24.360
I had a good grilled
cheese sandwich.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.696
Every day, I'd
come home from work

08:27.720 --> 08:29.616
and say I was gonna make myself
a grilled cheese sandwich,

08:29.640 --> 08:30.915
but I was always too tired.

08:33.640 --> 08:34.756
Now, I've finally
done it.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
You want a bite?

08:43.480 --> 08:44.834
So, that's it, then?

08:44.960 --> 08:46.872
You're just gonna sit here

08:46.960 --> 08:48.840
and wait for the Dark Army to
come and kill you?

08:50.360 --> 08:52.096
Or did you actually think
that dresser over there

08:52.120 --> 08:54.360
was gonna do anything more
than throw off your Feng Shui?

08:54.520 --> 08:56.000
I told you,
I need to stay here.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.958
What you need is to
hit the road with me

08:58.040 --> 08:59.760
and get a good night's sleep
somewhere safe.

09:00.680 --> 09:01.816
You know,
you're the second person

09:01.840 --> 09:02.880
that's told me that today.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.080
"Good night's sleep."

09:07.400 --> 09:08.516
Boss said the same thing.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.796
Five years.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.816
I haven't really slept
in five years,

09:14.840 --> 09:15.910
save for a few
nightmares.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.994
Not true, I saw you sleeping
last time I was here.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.400
You mean when I busted you

09:22.440 --> 09:23.720
stealing my badge
out of my safe?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, I wasn't really asleep
then, either.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.640
What are you doing?

09:41.720 --> 09:42.870
Where do you
keep your socks?

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
Darlene...

09:50.040 --> 09:51.110
Stop!

09:51.200 --> 09:52.236
You're coming
with me.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.794
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.395
Well, I'm not gonna let you
just sit here and wait to die.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.280
As opposed to
what you're doing?

09:59.400 --> 10:00.959
What's your plan,
anyway?

10:01.040 --> 10:03.953
Run? How long?
How far?

10:04.840 --> 10:06.115
Where is this
magical place

10:06.200 --> 10:07.416
when you're gonna
feel safe enough

10:07.440 --> 10:08.999
to stop looking
over your shoulder?

10:10.120 --> 10:13.557
I'm not gonna let the Dark Army kill
another person I care about,

10:13.640 --> 10:15.677
not when there's something
I can still do about it.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.996
I'm good, Darlene,
the FBI has my back.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.470
The FBI has you under
investigation.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.230
Fine, you want my underwear?
Go for it.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.509
Dom, we have a plan.
A good one.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.080
We have got fake passports,

10:39.200 --> 10:41.032
plane tickets,
and safe transport.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.310
Just come with me.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.237
You're just gonna sit there
all alone?

10:48.640 --> 10:52.156
I'm not alone.
I have Alexa, remember?

10:52.480 --> 10:55.314
<i>Sorry, I'm having trouble
understanding right now.</i>

11:01.160 --> 11:02.753
What the fuck
did you just do?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.672
Snap the fuck
out of it!

11:05.760 --> 11:07.592
This is not a person!

11:07.680 --> 11:09.956
She is not real,
she is not your friend!

11:10.600 --> 11:13.672
She is just a robot you use
to buy paper towels!

11:14.840 --> 11:16.069
Look around you.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.839
Dom, this is emptiness.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.513
There is nothing
here for you,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.911
but there is still a chance for you
out there if you come with us.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.109
Now, go get
your toothbrush.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.874
Why don't you
go ahead without me?

12:28.960 --> 12:30.599
I'll be there
in a few minutes.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.960
Looks like you
found her okay.

12:47.520 --> 12:52.151
Yeah. She's still a little
shell-shocked, but she'll be fine.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.315
How about you?

13:01.640 --> 13:04.599
You're not gonna
come with us, are you?

13:09.200 --> 13:11.396
I need to go back
to Washington Township.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.678
And you cannot
come with me this time.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.876
I don't want to.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.800
This was it for me.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.673
I'm done now.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.590
Before I go...

13:37.480 --> 13:38.596
You wanna
do the honors?

13:41.040 --> 13:42.480
All the money has been
passed through

13:42.560 --> 13:44.756
multiple crypto-tumblers
and shell accounts.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.150
Should be completely
untraceable now.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.520
It's ready to go out.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.159
It should be you.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.199
This is your win,
not mine.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.400
Are you sure you don't wanna
come with us?

14:21.520 --> 14:23.273
I can't. I'm not done.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.755
Well, in that case...

14:50.600 --> 14:52.751
Any advice
for a road trip?

14:52.840 --> 14:54.160
Never been on one before.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.550
Neither have I.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.878
Recommend getting
a bunch of Sour Patch Kids.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.710
Come on.

15:51.840 --> 15:52.840
Oh, hey.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.790
Holy shit.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.594
I'm sorry, have we met?

16:03.800 --> 16:04.916
Yes, we fucking met.

16:06.920 --> 16:07.920
The barn?

16:11.480 --> 16:12.550
Doesn't ring a bell.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.560
You shot four people?

16:22.200 --> 16:24.510
Oh, shit! That's right.

16:25.640 --> 16:26.960
Now, I got you.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.595
What the hell's going on?

16:33.240 --> 16:34.240
You're Dark Army.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.476
No, dude.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.029
I'm actually here to help
my boy Elliot and his sis.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.032
So, what, you're just
a gun for hire, or...

16:47.240 --> 16:48.754
I mean,
it's like I always say.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.989
"Gotta keep an open mind at
every opportunity that comes your way."

16:53.160 --> 16:56.153
You seen that one movie,
<i>Three Days of the Condor,</i> right?

16:58.160 --> 16:59.936
Dude, you've never seen
<i>Three Days of the Condor,</i>

16:59.960 --> 17:01.713
and you're a fucking
FBI agent?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.240
You've gotta
check that out.

17:04.319 --> 17:07.438
And, normally, I don't go for
that '70s paranoia shit,

17:07.520 --> 17:10.035
but I don't know,
this one really spoke to me.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.556
You know, maybe it was
when my boy Joubert says...

17:14.960 --> 17:17.429
"I don't interest myself
in the why.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.314
"I think more often
in terms of the when,

17:20.400 --> 17:22.311
"sometimes 'where, '

17:22.400 --> 17:24.073
"but always 'how much."'

17:24.240 --> 17:26.550
I fuckin' felt that.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.031
Got me opening up
my eyes to diversify

17:29.120 --> 17:31.237
my revenue streams
and whatnot.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.552
Yo, last quarter, I nearly
tripled my net profits,

17:34.800 --> 17:36.416
according to this chick
who does my books,

17:36.440 --> 17:40.719
and shorty Japanese, so, you know,
she know what the fuck she talk about.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.319
She got me stumped off
this one question, though,

17:45.400 --> 17:47.232
saying that I should
incorporate soon.

17:48.480 --> 17:52.076
What do you think,
S-corp or LLC?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.075
Oh, shit.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.115
I forgot to tell you,
he's working with us now.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.599
You should get some rest.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.558
So I've heard.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.633
It's pretty out here.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.031
I've never driven
to Boston this way.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.476
We're taking the scenic route.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.272
Yeah, believe it or not,
Connecticut's swarming with Dark Army,

19:08.760 --> 19:11.150
given the concentration
of RWAs.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.600
"Rich white assholes."

19:15.720 --> 19:19.157
Yup, that's who they like
doing their business with.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.119
Usually, that's their
number-one client, in fact.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.919
Anyways, that's why we're staying
off the main roads.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.274
Besides, I gotta find
a rest stop anyway.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.353
Gotta steal me a mirror
real quick.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.596
What, do you not
know your Vonnegut?

19:44.400 --> 19:45.959
I gotta take a whiz, okay?

19:46.080 --> 19:48.151
Too many Code Reds
this morning.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.514
Man, nobody fucking
reads anymore.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.159
What do you think of Jackie?

20:16.520 --> 20:19.433
Jackie's whoever
you want her to be.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.475
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.232
You're not pretending to be
someone you're not.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.072
You think Leon's
my real name?

20:55.440 --> 20:56.954
Where are we?

20:58.560 --> 21:00.040
In the land of RWAs.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.550
Best you keep your eye out.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.760
Jackie's
a die-hard for Hall & Oates.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.559
She's a gym teacher.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.314
No, she's not
a gym teacher, she's a...

21:18.560 --> 21:19.914
A pastry chef.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.996
She's got a soft spot
for Nutella.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.351
- Are we ready?
- Not yet.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.150
Leon said something
about "stealing a mirror,"

21:59.240 --> 22:01.755
and then went on about
how illiterate America is,

22:01.880 --> 22:04.156
and then he said
he had to piss a bunch of red,

22:04.240 --> 22:06.277
so, I took that
as my cue to walk away.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.312
Look at all these people.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.555
They're all probably
on their way back home.

22:21.360 --> 22:25.274
Holidays are over. It's back to
the grind for most of 'em, I guess.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.430
That sucks.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.640
I wanna
show you something.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.836
Come on.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.154
Should we really
be out in the open like this?

22:46.120 --> 22:48.430
- I don't know.
- Maybe not.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.911
But, for once,
I wanna drop the paranoia

22:52.000 --> 22:53.320
and just
take all this in.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.160
Just for this moment.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.357
What is this moment,
exactly?

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
Watch this.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.114
What did you just do?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.798
Just give it a few seconds.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.559
Darlene, you're worrying me.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.320
I'm pretty good at that,
aren't I?

24:17.400 --> 24:19.119
- Tell me.
- Be patient.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.096
- If you did something, I need to know.
- Oh, do you?

24:21.120 --> 24:23.157
- Is this something illegal again?
- Dom...

24:23.240 --> 24:24.976
I'm serious, Darlene, if you don't
tell me what you're up to...

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Just wait.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.376
What is it with you
and breaking the law?

24:27.400 --> 24:28.400
It's like a fetish...

24:30.680 --> 24:33.240
Shut the fuck up
and just watch.

25:08.920 --> 25:12.197
I don't get it.
What's going on?

25:12.320 --> 25:14.516
All of the money
Whiterose and her cronies

25:14.600 --> 25:18.355
have been stealing for decades
just went back to the people.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.440
How?

25:28.040 --> 25:30.430
We found a way to evenly
disburse it anonymously

25:30.520 --> 25:32.398
into everyone's Ecoin wallets.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.114
Everyone got this much?

25:45.760 --> 25:46.760
Yup.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.478
And due to E Corp's insistence

25:49.560 --> 25:52.155
that Ecoin remain independent
from the US dollar,

25:52.240 --> 25:54.152
it is completely impossible

25:54.280 --> 25:56.317
for them to reverse
the transactions.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.758
This is illegal.
This is stealing.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.150
After what the Dark Army
did to you...

26:06.240 --> 26:08.516
Fuck, after what they did
to everyone,

26:08.600 --> 26:10.432
you really wanna start
defending them?

26:10.520 --> 26:12.512
This isn't what justice
is supposed to look like.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.159
We have laws
for a reason.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.197
And they were so powerful,
they wrote the laws

26:16.280 --> 26:17.680
to benefit themselves.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.840
They got away
with everything,

26:19.920 --> 26:22.151
because they banked on us,
all of us,

26:22.240 --> 26:24.152
to trust the system.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.756
That was our vulnerability,
and they took advantage of it.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.515
It took this
to finally stop them.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.114
And you were
a part of it.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.395
Look around.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.436
This is it.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.354
Everything
we've been through

26:43.440 --> 26:44.840
led up to this one moment...

26:46.680 --> 26:49.752
The greatest redistribution
of wealth in history.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.957
Hey, Mom!
Mom, check your phone!

26:53.840 --> 26:57.629
We just Robin-Hooded
those evil motherfuckers.

26:59.680 --> 27:03.754
If you ask me, this is exactly
what justice looks like.

27:07.680 --> 27:08.830
Whoo!

27:10.600 --> 27:12.034
Whoo!

27:14.040 --> 27:15.360
Whoo!

27:16.480 --> 27:17.596
Whoo!

27:19.120 --> 27:20.520
Whoo!

27:22.000 --> 27:24.276
- People are staring at you.
- I don't care!

27:25.000 --> 27:27.674
Fuck yeah, bitches!

27:27.760 --> 27:29.194
Whoo!

28:10.400 --> 28:11.480
Hey, make sure
you check out

28:11.520 --> 28:13.477
that Sydney Pollack joint
when you get a chance.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.872
Thank me later, Jackie.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.195
So...

28:26.040 --> 28:27.872
Did you keep any of it?

28:29.920 --> 28:31.149
Keep what?

28:34.680 --> 28:36.797
Covert. That's cool.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.515
I'm saying, though,

28:39.600 --> 28:41.881
if you're looking to get into
some shit when you get back,

28:42.120 --> 28:45.352
- I got some shit for you.
- Like what?

28:45.840 --> 28:47.240
Adventures and whatnot.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.874
You know,
a high like this,

28:51.240 --> 28:53.675
it don't come so easy
with the normies.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.952
Thanks, dude, but, uh...

28:57.040 --> 28:58.952
I'm trying to lay low
for a bit.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.076
No doubt.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.470
But with skills like yours,
the pay is good,

29:03.040 --> 29:04.256
and you get to be
your own boss,

29:04.280 --> 29:06.920
'cause, you know...
You a boss, girl.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.154
Let me think about it.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.155
Cool.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.993
Until the next episode, then.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.756
Go right ahead.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.270
Dom?

30:00.440 --> 30:01.920
How the hell are you?

30:04.880 --> 30:07.839
Hey, you coming over here
to pick up a copy?

30:07.920 --> 30:09.957
Hey, they're great
for long flights.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.952
A real page turner.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.736
Especially when you get to the part
where he strangles his mother to death

30:14.760 --> 30:16.240
in Chapter 12.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.193
Spoiler alert.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.399
You know, today's
your lucky day. Um...

30:24.480 --> 30:26.119
I'm gonna sign you a copy.

30:32.800 --> 30:33.870
Here you go.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.715
Oh, come on.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.080
Yeah, the book's
flying off the shelves.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.315
It's a real
stocking stuffer.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.496
In fact, that's what
I'm doing here.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.830
I got a little
book tour stop at UMass.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.037
Anyway,
how have you been?

31:01.560 --> 31:02.789
That Elliot's sister?

31:05.160 --> 31:06.879
You two
a thing now, or...

31:08.480 --> 31:10.676
I knew I picked up
on something.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.709
Please don't hurt us.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.160
Hurt you?

31:18.080 --> 31:19.878
Why would I hurt you?

31:22.080 --> 31:23.080
Because I...

31:24.480 --> 31:25.709
I disobeyed orders.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.156
I killed my handler.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.795
Oh, she was
a pain in the ass.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.712
Trust me, you were
doing them a favor.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.519
And your little loudmouth
friend over there,

31:36.600 --> 31:39.195
yeah, well, what she did
was a bad thing, but...

31:40.080 --> 31:41.958
Well, word around camp is

31:42.040 --> 31:43.918
they don't care
about you two no more.

31:46.840 --> 31:47.876
What do you mean?

31:49.400 --> 31:51.676
They've picked up
and skedaddled off

31:51.760 --> 31:53.399
to something
more important.

31:53.480 --> 31:54.480
Where?

31:55.480 --> 31:56.630
That, I can't tell you.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.440
But all those things
you said

31:59.560 --> 32:01.552
you were gonna do
to my family...

32:02.640 --> 32:04.597
No one cares
about your family now.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.312
And, look, I'm telling you,
the Dark Army

32:08.400 --> 32:11.040
is not something you need
to worry about no more.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.314
And, look,

32:13.400 --> 32:15.278
if they wanted
to get to you two,

32:15.360 --> 32:17.591
I would know about it.
Trust me.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.720
But...

32:21.080 --> 32:23.914
But I saw you
butcher Santiago with an axe

32:24.000 --> 32:25.639
when he got out of line.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.360
Yeah...

32:30.760 --> 32:32.035
That was fun.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.073
All right, well...

32:37.920 --> 32:39.070
This was nice.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.270
I'm gonna go.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.158
Make sure
you pay for that.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.873
She still needs
to pay for that.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.830
Take it easy, Dom.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.656
He just wanted me
to buy one of his books.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.519
And you did?

33:09.600 --> 33:11.671
Cashier made me
because he autographed it.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.392
He actually said
they don't care anymore?

33:19.720 --> 33:20.720
Yup.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.880
I don't get it.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.877
Where did the Dark Army go?

33:26.600 --> 33:29.160
I don't know.
He wouldn't tell me.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.516
All I know is, we don't
have to run anymore.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.270
Yeah, but we're here.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.036
Might as well still go.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.794
I've heard Budapest
is pretty dope.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.833
Why Budapest, anyway?

34:01.960 --> 34:06.671
Cisco always talked
about going there,

34:06.760 --> 34:08.911
but once what happened,
happened...

34:10.920 --> 34:14.118
I just couldn't go by myself.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.616
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

34:17.639 --> 34:18.775
<i>may I have
your attention, please.</i>

34:18.800 --> 34:24.159
<i>Globe Airlines flight 4057 to Budapest
will begin boarding at gate B31, shortly.</i>

34:24.239 --> 34:27.152
That's us.
We should get going.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.320
Where's your brother?

34:38.320 --> 34:39.514
He's not coming
with us.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.320
Why not?

34:45.639 --> 34:47.359
He's running behind.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.313
He's gonna catch the next flight out.
Let's go.

34:52.679 --> 34:53.795
Wait...

35:01.280 --> 35:03.317
I can't do this.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.595
Can't do what?

35:13.720 --> 35:16.997
You convinced me to come
because the Dark Army was a threat.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.350
Now, they're not.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.355
Doesn't mean
we still can't go.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.474
Do you even really wanna go
to Budapest, anyway?

35:26.600 --> 35:29.593
You said it yourself, this was
Cisco's dream, not yours.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.357
Then we won't go there.

35:34.440 --> 35:37.194
When we land, we'll hitch
a ride to somewhere else,

35:37.320 --> 35:38.595
just come with me.

35:38.760 --> 35:39.910
Darlene.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.953
I can't go.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.633
But you said you would.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.317
You don't need me
to come with you.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.397
Whatever your brother's
actually up to,

36:04.480 --> 36:06.949
you don't need him, either.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.235
No, I can't
handle shit solo, Dom.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.840
You've seen me.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.555
I get panic attacks,
I freak out...

36:21.640 --> 36:22.960
You're gonna be fine.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.311
I'm no good on my own.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.629
I've tried.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.879
I'm sorry.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.114
I've got
responsibilities here.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.874
I can't just walk away

36:44.960 --> 36:47.270
from my family
and my job, my...

36:47.440 --> 36:50.319
"Responsibilities"?
That's what this is about?

36:51.760 --> 36:53.353
You know your family is safe,

36:53.480 --> 36:55.631
your job is on hold.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.394
There is nothing for you
to do here.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.198
Jesus, Dom, no wonder
you can't sleep.

37:09.840 --> 37:13.516
You hold on to a lot,
and you hold on fucking tight.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.232
Maybe running away
might actually help you.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.797
Running away to Budapest
will help me?

37:21.320 --> 37:22.595
This isn't about Budapest.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.315
You leave this airport,

37:25.400 --> 37:26.736
you're just gonna go back
to the grind,

37:26.760 --> 37:28.353
like everyone else.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.799
I'm talking about giving
yourself a break.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.596
Okay?
About finally letting go.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.435
<i>Globe Airlines

38:14.280 --> 38:16.237
And one other thing...

38:22.520 --> 38:23.520
I wrote down the number

38:23.600 --> 38:24.954
of a friend of mine.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.870
He works
at US Cyber Command.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.311
Your bright idea
is for me to be some pig?

38:33.960 --> 38:35.633
When you're ready to grow up.

38:41.440 --> 38:44.114
Don't take too long, though.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.429
They need you.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.677
They can't handle me.

something I can help you with?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.871
Are you
missing something?

42:53.640 --> 42:54.640
Uh...

42:56.160 --> 42:57.160
No, I'm good.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.720
Yeah.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.431
Yeah, but I'm not going.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.656
Are you sure?
I can get someone.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.909
No.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.160
No, I've got it.

44:24.560 --> 44:26.358
I can take care
