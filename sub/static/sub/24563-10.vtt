The entire prison has fallen
under the control

00:04.787 --> 00:05.744
of its prisoners.

00:05.831 --> 00:08.051
[indistinct clamoring]

00:08.138 --> 00:10.445
I turned him once,
I can turn him again.

00:10.532 --> 00:13.665
It's time Ninjago
meets their new emperor.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.667

00:17.756 --> 00:20.629
It's not safe to be out.
Please, return to your homes.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.596
'Tensions are high.'

00:31.683 --> 00:33.337
But the question on
everyone's mind

00:33.424 --> 00:34.904
is where are our ninja?

00:34.991 --> 00:37.428
And is the Green Ninja okay?

00:37.515 --> 00:40.301
- Lloyd.
- Not now, sweetie.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.085
Lloyd, Lloyd.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.090
What are you drawing?

00:58.580 --> 01:00.408
- 'Misako.'
- Is my son okay?

01:00.495 --> 01:02.062
- 'We found him.'
- Ah.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.933
[Nya]
'But he's in a
really bad shape.'

01:04.020 --> 01:05.761
'We're headed your way, but..'

01:05.848 --> 01:08.416
'But we don't know what to do.
It's like..'

01:08.503 --> 01:10.505
'It's like his life force
is fading.'

01:10.592 --> 01:12.115
Lloyd, help.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.208
[Misako]
I know where to take him.

We're good people.
We have nothing to give you.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.926
Your village is surrounded.

02:24.013 --> 02:27.147
Kneel before
your new emperor.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.018
We will never kneel.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.412
Our people have already
taken up arms.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.196
We will fight, if need be.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.459
[grunting]

02:35.546 --> 02:37.853
Taken up arms?

02:40.072 --> 02:43.554
These people know not
of your power, my emperor.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.949
Show them, show all of Ninjago

02:47.036 --> 02:49.169
how to kneel.

There's.. There's too..

03:27.990 --> 03:30.688
There's too much I can't..
Please..

03:30.775 --> 03:32.647
Hurry, he's burning up.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.305
You cannot hurry tea

03:38.392 --> 03:41.656
only have patience
to get it right.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.139
It is ready.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.880
Is it going to
make him better?

03:48.967 --> 03:51.927
It will heal
his wounds, but..

03:53.145 --> 03:54.451
But, what?

03:54.538 --> 03:57.237
[sighing]
There's always a "But."

03:57.324 --> 03:59.456
It comes with a price.

03:59.543 --> 04:02.285
Whatever it is, we will pay it.

04:02.372 --> 04:05.332
I will take
no coin for this.

04:05.419 --> 04:08.987
I speak of a price
for you and your friend.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.512
Each of you must lay your hand

04:11.599 --> 04:12.817
'upon him.'

04:12.904 --> 04:14.863
'The chi will focus'

04:14.950 --> 04:18.954
your elemental powers
to save him.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.304
But it may use up
all the power

04:21.391 --> 04:23.524
you have left.

04:23.611 --> 04:24.873
Are you telling me to save him

04:24.960 --> 04:26.048
we could lose our power?

04:26.135 --> 04:27.441
Perhaps.

04:27.528 --> 04:28.920
Perhaps not.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.358
[groaning]

04:31.445 --> 04:33.098
- Do it.
- Wait.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.492
You don't just jump into
decisions like this. I mean--

04:35.579 --> 04:37.059
You're just worried
about yourself.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.582
Maybe I am.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.368
But you saw how powerful
Lord Garmadon was.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.544
Without our elemental powers

04:43.631 --> 04:44.849
what chance do we have?

04:44.936 --> 04:47.374
The decision needs
to be unanimous.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.463
I will give up my power
to save Lloyd.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.379
- Me too.
- It's not even a choice.

...we wait.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.377
[indistinct humming]

05:46.389 --> 05:47.869
So..

05:47.956 --> 05:49.827
At least we have
our powers.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.873
Yeah.
But is it enough?

05:51.960 --> 05:53.788
- It always is.
- But what if it's not?

05:53.875 --> 05:55.311
Ninja never quit.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.487
Ninja don't last forever.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.577
Whatever happens

06:00.664 --> 06:02.318
we fight on.

What possibly
could be so important

06:08.933 --> 06:10.674
that you have to do
that now?

06:10.761 --> 06:13.024
Just a little something..

06:13.111 --> 06:14.722
[chuckles]

06:14.809 --> 06:16.158

Take out?

06:22.425 --> 06:24.732

06:25.646 --> 06:28.562
Remember, to go.

06:55.806 --> 06:56.851
...run!

06:56.938 --> 06:59.114
[thudding]

06:59.201 --> 07:00.507
What could do that?

07:00.594 --> 07:02.857
Only a being of great size.

07:05.337 --> 07:06.426
[crash]

- What about Lloyd?

what happens next.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.253
Yah!

I will raze your city

back into the dust
from which it came.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.697

Not so fast.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.308
"Not so fast?"

08:46.395 --> 08:47.657
That's our big entrance?

08:47.744 --> 08:49.180
You used that ages ago.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.052
After all these battles,
all this time

08:51.139 --> 08:52.488
you couldn't come up
with something better?

08:52.575 --> 08:54.098
Look, I'm sorry
if I'm distracted

Lloyd, what is it?

10:30.455 --> 10:33.981
I had a dream
o-of a giant.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.852
And my father

10:35.939 --> 10:37.375
he's looking for Wu.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.247
That is no dream.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.423
That is a vision.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.381
Do you still have your power?

I-I can't..

You're alive.
That's all you need to know.

10:54.175 --> 10:57.569
You need to get to the child
before it's too late.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.920
But without my power

11:00.007 --> 11:02.966

what made you powerful.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.653
It was knowing what to do

13:52.701 --> 13:54.442
Misako, get down.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.930
This way!

14:12.025 --> 14:14.418
Running will do you no good.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.377
Give us the child.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.813
Is this what you want?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.772
To destroy the city?
Create more victims?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.819
Just think how many others
will be made like you.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.777
This isn't what you want.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.344
Oh, no.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.303
This is just the beginning.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.899
Where are your powers, Lloyd

14:59.986 --> 15:02.075
as your city falls?

15:14.696 --> 15:16.524
Hold on.

[music continues]

15:29.580 --> 15:30.842
[panting]

15:30.930 --> 15:32.279
The sons of Garmadon

15:32.366 --> 15:34.498
could always use one more.

15:34.585 --> 15:35.935
Join us.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.288
Yeah, that never works.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.388
[grunting]

15:57.913 --> 15:59.001
I have Wu.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.960
Can any of you hear me?

16:02.787 --> 16:04.311
Where is everyone?

16:05.616 --> 16:07.009
[engines reviving]

16:08.619 --> 16:10.534
[Kai]
We hear you loud and clear.

[chuckling]

16:19.282 --> 16:20.370
Jump!

16:21.937 --> 16:24.113
It's too far.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.072
Get us closer.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.818
This is close
as I can get her.

16:38.475 --> 16:39.563
[grunting]

16:44.307 --> 16:45.700
[engine reviving]

16:45.787 --> 16:46.788
Careful!

16:46.875 --> 16:48.094
Are you actually doubting

16:48.181 --> 16:49.747
my ability
to closely approximate

16:49.834 --> 16:51.488
the true value
of our surroundings?

16:51.575 --> 16:52.794
I'm a nindroid.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.014
[grunting]

16:56.754 --> 16:58.887
Give me the child.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.237
The emperor wants his brother.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.066
Lloyd, jump.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.894
You can make it.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.509
[grunting]

17:12.596 --> 17:13.945
Catch him.

17:16.383 --> 17:17.688
What? No.

17:24.652 --> 17:25.783
[dramatic music]

17:25.870 --> 17:26.915
[groaning]

17:29.874 --> 17:32.138
- We have to go back.
- I'll circle around.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.793
[music continues]

17:35.880 --> 17:38.144
You shouldn't have done that.

No!

[groaning]

18:04.605 --> 18:06.302
This is the end, Lloyd.

18:06.389 --> 18:09.697
Watch to see how you
loose it all.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.701
[rumbling]

18:15.703 --> 18:18.662
Hands off, you big oaf.
We just had a repair.

18:18.749 --> 18:21.535
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

18:21.622 --> 18:24.320
[groaning]
I can't break free
from its hold.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.501
We have "To go."

18:31.588 --> 18:33.851
What do you think
we're trying to do?

18:33.938 --> 18:35.636
We have "To go."

18:35.723 --> 18:37.246
"To go."

18:38.682 --> 18:41.990
"For your time of need,
tea to go."

18:42.077 --> 18:44.601
[gasping]
I think this is why
she gave us this.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.604
Well, what are you waiting for?

18:49.302 --> 18:51.173
[instrumental music]

18:58.746 --> 19:00.704
[creaking]

19:00.791 --> 19:03.011
- Go!
- Go where?

19:03.098 --> 19:05.231
I feel funny.

19:05.318 --> 19:08.103
What's happening?

19:08.190 --> 19:10.105
[creaking]

19:12.020 --> 19:13.152
No!

19:16.024 --> 19:19.070
This, this is what I wanted

19:19.158 --> 19:21.247
to see your father's return.

19:21.334 --> 19:24.424
And for you
to lose everything.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.476
How does it feel
to see the end?

19:44.139 --> 19:45.532
No.

19:45.619 --> 19:48.361
I won't let it do to me
what it did to you.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.189
This isn't the end, Harumi.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.973
This is just the beginning.

19:52.060 --> 19:55.019
Without my power,
without my friends

19:55.106 --> 19:57.892
I'm gonna fight you,
I'm gonna fight on.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.634
Because a ninja never quits.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.331
Well, then..

20:02.418 --> 20:03.941
Goodbye, Lloyd.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.378
Before I go

20:05.465 --> 20:07.162
just answer me this.

20:07.249 --> 20:10.296
You said the greatest villain
was the one who got away.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.603
Then what am I?

20:14.343 --> 20:15.779

20:48.334 --> 20:50.249
...is mine.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.539
Looks like we're no longer
in Ninjago.

[Cole groans]

21:26.285 --> 21:28.504
Then, where are we?
