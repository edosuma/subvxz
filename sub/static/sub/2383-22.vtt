00:00.981 --> 00:03.049
Kids, when your Uncle Marshall
<i>finally quit</i>

00:03.059 --> 00:05.693
<i>Goliath National Bank to do</i>
<i>something better with his life,</i>

00:05.774 --> 00:07.374
<i>he left on great terms</i>
<i>with his boss.</i>

00:07.375 --> 00:09.477
Good luck, Marshall. And promise

00:09.478 --> 00:11.812
you'll list me as a reference.

00:14.499 --> 00:15.883
<i>Which made Marshall's</i>
<i>big interview</i>

00:15.884 --> 00:17.918
<i>with a respected</i>
<i>environmental organization</i>

00:17.919 --> 00:19.153
<i>all the more confusing.</i>

00:19.154 --> 00:20.654
I'm sorry. I don't think
you're the kind

00:20.655 --> 00:22.022
of person we're looking for.

00:22.023 --> 00:25.126
I just got off the phone
with Arthur Hobbs over at GNB.

00:25.127 --> 00:27.328
Oh, yeah, I worked
with Marshall Eriksen...

00:27.329 --> 00:29.897
at least I did
when he actually showed up.

00:29.898 --> 00:33.467
Marshall! Hey, it's,
uh, it's 2:30.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.386
If it's no big deal,
we'd sure love it

00:35.387 --> 00:37.505
if you'd try to get here
at least before lunch.

00:37.506 --> 00:40.274
Yeah? And I'd sure love
to give a rat's ass.

00:44.729 --> 00:46.580
Oh! Mr. Eriksen...

00:46.581 --> 00:49.049
You're not wearing any pants.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.452
Your move.

00:55.190 --> 00:57.408
But Marshall, wh...
What about the environment?

00:57.409 --> 01:00.528
Screw the environment!

01:00.529 --> 01:02.129
"Screw the environment"?!

01:02.130 --> 01:03.564
Oh, yeah.

01:03.565 --> 01:07.234
We fired him when we caught him
clubbing a seal in his office

01:07.235 --> 01:09.470
with an even cuter seal.

01:09.471 --> 01:11.639
The guy's a maniac.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.726
He's just an awful,
flatulent racist.

01:15.727 --> 01:16.811
Sir, none of that is...

01:16.812 --> 01:19.613
Sorry. Interview over.

01:22.717 --> 01:26.554
<i>And so Marshall stormed over</i>
<i>to GNB, where he ran into Zoey.</i>

01:26.555 --> 01:28.272
If you want to get back
at those jerks,

01:28.273 --> 01:30.624
I have a proposition for you.

01:31.693 --> 01:35.262
Invitations for the demolition
of The Arcadian.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.698
As head of the project, I get
to decide how we knock it down.

01:37.699 --> 01:40.918
I'm torn between training
an actual coyote

01:40.919 --> 01:42.770
to use an ACME dynamite plunger,

01:42.771 --> 01:46.040
or hooking up a fuse
to Eddie Van Halen's guitar

01:46.041 --> 01:49.009
that goes off the second
he hits the last note

01:49.010 --> 01:50.344
to "Hot For Teacher."

01:53.798 --> 01:56.467
Barney! Barney! Bar...

01:56.468 --> 01:58.452
No, no. I'm going to go coyote.

01:58.453 --> 02:01.088
Wait. While no one
wants to see

02:01.089 --> 02:03.390
a, uh, coyote wearing
a little hard hat

02:03.391 --> 02:05.092
more than me, remember:

02:05.093 --> 02:08.262
Zoey's protest could still
shut your whole project down.

02:08.263 --> 02:10.097
Oh, come on. Zoey's not
shutting anything down,

02:10.098 --> 02:11.665
standing out there
with her stupid megaphone,

02:11.666 --> 02:15.135
screaming in the wind; butt
cheeks trembling with fury;

02:15.136 --> 02:17.872
her perky breasts heaving;

02:17.873 --> 02:20.274
her self-righteous nipples...

02:20.275 --> 02:21.775
Dude, that's my girlfriend.

02:21.776 --> 02:26.146
Point is, we are taking her
and The Arcadian down.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.548
Am I right, Teddy Westside?

02:27.549 --> 02:29.300
You know it.
Ha-ha!

02:29.301 --> 02:31.118
Okay. See, that's
so weird to me.

02:31.119 --> 02:33.520
One second you're
defending Zoey,

02:33.521 --> 02:35.556
and the next, you're talking
about her going down.

02:35.557 --> 02:37.725
Glad to know she's also
mouthy in a good way.

02:37.726 --> 02:40.094
What up?

02:40.095 --> 02:42.429
Dude, that's his girlfriend.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.999
Isn't it tough
dating the woman

02:45.000 --> 02:47.401
that's trying to prevent your
building from being built?

02:47.402 --> 02:48.702
At first, yes,
but we figured out

02:48.703 --> 02:51.672
a great way to deal with it:
we never talk about it.

02:51.673 --> 02:54.742
And since then, we've really been
enjoying each other's company.

02:54.743 --> 02:56.577
So, every time The
Arcadian comes up,

02:56.578 --> 02:59.179
you guys just awkwardly
change the subject?

02:59.180 --> 03:00.748
Yeah, but you'd
be surprised.

03:00.749 --> 03:02.249
It doesn't even
come up that often.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.951
- Hey, guys.
- ALL: Hey!

03:03.952 --> 03:07.454
Meet the new lawyer I hired
to help save The Arcadian.

03:11.326 --> 03:13.928
So Oprah's retiring. Oof!

03:13.929 --> 03:16.664
What's that world
gonna be like?

Wait, Marshall's helping you
save The Arcadian, now?

03:33.882 --> 03:36.166
Yeah. Having a former
GNB employee

03:36.167 --> 03:37.985
on our side
is huge for us.

03:37.986 --> 03:40.738
GNB is going down.
Yeah, totally.

03:41.556 --> 03:46.160
So, they found water
on Mars. What?

03:46.161 --> 03:48.362
Listen, um,
I hate to go up

03:48.363 --> 03:49.997

best friends, but...

03:49.998 --> 03:51.832
I really, I really
need this right now.

03:51.833 --> 03:53.167
I mean, we're, we're

03:53.168 --> 03:57.137
Not only do you quit the job
I stuck my neck out to get you,

03:57.138 --> 03:59.506
now you sabotage the
project I'm in charge of?

03:59.507 --> 04:01.375
Is this because
I brushed Lily's boob

04:01.376 --> 04:02.576
with my elbow,
the other day?

04:02.577 --> 04:04.445
That was on purpose!
What now?

04:04.446 --> 04:06.313
I mean this is really like...

Barney sent us pictures

04:34.075 --> 04:36.743
Babe, can I get you
a drink?

04:36.744 --> 04:38.979
No, I'm still not...

04:38.980 --> 04:40.764
ready to put my mouth
on anything yet.

04:40.765 --> 04:42.783
I know.

04:44.185 --> 04:46.286
You know what?
Screw this.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.971
Game on.

04:55.630 --> 04:57.097
Can you believe this one?

04:57.098 --> 04:58.782
Wants our booth.

04:58.783 --> 05:00.367
Keeps giving us the walk-by.

05:00.368 --> 05:03.454
That bitch is <i>not</i>

05:03.455 --> 05:04.872
The walk-by with the stink eye.

05:08.443 --> 05:10.044
I hope this drink
isn't teething,

05:10.045 --> 05:11.611
'cause it's about to get nursed.

05:14.883 --> 05:17.167
Barney! Your wife just called
from the hospital!

05:17.168 --> 05:18.752
It's a boy!

05:18.753 --> 05:21.955
No.
I' was... I was...

05:23.458 --> 05:25.492
<i>This went on for days.</i>

05:25.493 --> 05:27.428
Congratulations.

05:27.429 --> 05:30.464
You're about to be the 250th
girl that Barney has slept with.

05:30.465 --> 05:31.899
Pfff. Try 283.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.501
250 was months ago.
No, no, no.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.020
No, I mean,
you're totally 250, baby.

05:37.021 --> 05:38.489
No, don't.

05:38.490 --> 05:40.691
Oh, bye-bye.

05:44.245 --> 05:46.180
Mr. Stinson...

05:46.181 --> 05:49.483
I had to rush down as soon
as I got your results.

05:49.484 --> 05:50.501
I'm sorry,

05:50.502 --> 05:54.021
but your crabs have
super-herpes.

05:58.159 --> 05:59.927
Oh, boy.

05:59.928 --> 06:01.361
Look who's back.

06:01.362 --> 06:04.765
Look, Lily, I think
this girl wants our seats.

06:04.766 --> 06:06.433
Should we leave...
or stay here

06:06.434 --> 06:11.004
Lionel Richie style--
"All Night Long"?

06:11.005 --> 06:13.673
Excuse me waitress,
I'll have a mojito!

06:13.674 --> 06:16.026
And you'll have a no-seat-ho.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.060
Oh...!

06:21.683 --> 06:23.817
Ah, yes...

06:23.818 --> 06:27.020
the sweet, smoky taste
of victory.

06:27.021 --> 06:29.623
Are you sure it doesn't taste
like anything else?

06:31.025 --> 06:32.025
That's it!

06:32.026 --> 06:33.360
Kent! Kent!

06:34.362 --> 06:35.913
Oh, God! Ow...

06:35.914 --> 06:37.881
Why would you do that
to your own jacket?!

06:37.882 --> 06:40.200
That's what you get,
you traitor!

06:41.052 --> 06:43.086
Oh, really? Really?
Yeah. Really.

06:43.087 --> 06:45.038
Really. That... what...

06:45.039 --> 06:48.175
Okay, enough! You
guys are out of here.

06:48.176 --> 06:50.377
Ejected!

06:50.378 --> 06:52.179
I meant all of you.

06:52.180 --> 06:55.082
You're all banned
from the bar. Out!

06:55.083 --> 06:57.184
Carl!

06:57.185 --> 06:58.719
Oh...
This has nothing to do with us.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.354
You're totally ridiculous.

07:04.776 --> 07:07.327
Don't look, baby. Just
don't look. Come on.

07:13.304 --> 07:16.139
This stupid feud isn't going to
end until Marshall and Barney

07:16.140 --> 07:17.674
finally talk
about their feelings, cry,

07:17.675 --> 07:20.343
and then hug it out
like they do on <i>Oprah.</i>

07:21.362 --> 07:23.363
Man, what are we going to do
without her?

07:23.364 --> 07:25.566
Oh...

07:28.169 --> 07:31.739
Wait, you know what, these guys are
not going to get all mushy sober.

07:31.740 --> 07:33.540
We need to get
these bitches drunk.

07:33.541 --> 07:36.176
Yes, but the right kind
of drunk.

07:36.177 --> 07:38.779
Uh... we should go
with something mellow.

07:38.780 --> 07:40.814
Maybe red wine?

07:40.815 --> 07:41.915
Oh, I don't know.

07:41.916 --> 07:44.418
Red wine has kind of
an odd effect on Barney.

07:44.419 --> 07:47.755
<i>He reaches a point</i>
<i>of sad clarity.</i>

07:47.756 --> 07:49.056
Ten, nine, eight...

07:49.057 --> 07:50.924
I'm a B-plus.

07:50.925 --> 07:52.793
My whole life,
I was hoping to be an A,

07:52.794 --> 07:55.028
and I'm a B-plus.

07:55.029 --> 07:57.030
And I'm okay with that.

07:57.031 --> 07:59.233
Happy New Year!

07:59.234 --> 08:00.901
If we want them
to open up,

08:00.902 --> 08:03.403
I say we go
straight-up gin.

08:03.404 --> 08:05.439
Oh... last time
Marshall got gin-drunk

08:05.440 --> 08:08.242
was at that douchey bar
Barney likes to go to.

08:08.243 --> 08:10.861
Marshall almost got
in a fight that night.

08:18.486 --> 08:19.920
<i>Look at this meatball.</i>

08:19.921 --> 08:23.624
<i>He's headed right towards me,</i>
<i>showing me no respect.</i>

08:23.625 --> 08:24.992
<i>Well, if he wants</i>
<i>to play chicken,</i>

08:24.993 --> 08:27.511
<i>this rooster</i>
<i>ain't backing down!</i>

08:30.398 --> 08:35.135
<i>Oh. Mirror.</i>

08:35.135 --> 08:36.804
How about martinis?

08:36.804 --> 08:38.038
Absolutely not.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.307
I'm not going anywhere
near you and a martini.

08:40.308 --> 08:42.142
Why not?

08:42.143 --> 08:43.693
Ooh...

08:43.695 --> 08:46.079
You know what
would be stupid?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.514
If we made out.

08:47.515 --> 08:49.733
That would be so stupid.

08:50.819 --> 08:54.488
Hey, I dare you guys
to dare us to make out.

08:55.490 --> 08:56.990
Every time.

08:56.991 --> 09:00.994
I only say that because
it would be so stupid if we did.

09:00.995 --> 09:03.430
So stupid...

09:03.431 --> 09:04.498
Uh-huh.

09:04.499 --> 09:08.602
Oh, yeah? Well... what
about you and absinthe?

09:08.603 --> 09:11.238
I don't know. We could have
water, soda, purple stuff...

09:11.239 --> 09:14.641
We're a dream a baby's having.

09:14.642 --> 09:16.093
We're a dream a baby's having.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.446
I keep telling you,
that didn't happen.

09:19.447 --> 09:21.415
It happened,
and it changed me.

09:22.283 --> 09:23.550
How about daiquiris?

09:23.551 --> 09:26.737
Maybe. When Marshall
has daiquiris...

09:26.738 --> 09:30.357
<i>he gets really into</i>
<i>how beautiful he is.</i>

09:30.358 --> 09:35.796
Hey. I dare you guys
to dare us to make out.

09:35.797 --> 09:38.298
Hey, Marsh, you know
that's another mirror, right?

09:41.035 --> 09:42.536
Peppermint schnapps?

09:42.537 --> 09:43.737
No. Peppermint schnapps

09:43.738 --> 09:45.839
turns Barney
into Richard Dawson.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.108
Who? The crazy old host
of <i>Family Feud,</i>

09:48.109 --> 09:50.978
who greeted women
by kissing them on the mouth.

09:50.979 --> 09:52.679
Hey there, darlin'.

09:53.882 --> 09:55.549
How you doin'?

09:56.417 --> 09:58.218
Ah, is this your sister?

09:58.219 --> 09:59.553
Mmm...

09:59.554 --> 10:00.888
Beautiful.

10:00.889 --> 10:02.289
Mmm...

10:04.092 --> 10:05.459
Hey, where are our
chicken wings?

10:05.460 --> 10:07.144
Show me chicken wings!

10:08.196 --> 10:11.315
Good order, Ted! Good order!

10:11.316 --> 10:13.734
Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey,
then we're off.

10:13.735 --> 10:15.652
See you Sunday.
Oh, wait, Ted.

10:15.653 --> 10:19.506
Do you have a specific reaction
to any kind of alcohol?

10:19.507 --> 10:20.941
Bourbon.

10:20.942 --> 10:22.542
When I drink bourbon...

10:22.543 --> 10:25.796
I get weirdly good
at beatboxing.

10:33.338 --> 10:34.588
Peace, I'm out.

10:35.807 --> 10:37.257
Yes!
Yes!

10:37.258 --> 10:39.293
Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you,

10:39.294 --> 10:42.429
but the bourbon only makes it
sound good to you.

10:46.301 --> 10:47.968
♪ Ki-ki, ki-ki, ki-ki, ki-ki ♪

10:47.969 --> 10:49.469

10:49.470 --> 10:52.105

10:53.341 --> 10:54.374
Poo!

10:54.375 --> 10:56.510
Peace. I'm out.

11:00.515 --> 11:03.350
You had to take that away
from me, didn't you?

11:05.169 --> 11:07.504
Well, enjoy
Martha's Vineyard.

11:07.505 --> 11:08.822
Hopefully by the time
you get back,

11:08.823 --> 11:10.057
we'll be allowed
back into MacLaren's.

11:10.058 --> 11:11.458
What do you mean?

11:11.459 --> 11:13.994
Barney and Marshall's feud
got us banned from the bar.

11:13.995 --> 11:16.863
We lost our booth.

11:16.864 --> 11:17.998
Stop.

11:17.999 --> 11:21.168
Man, how did things
get so screwed up?

11:21.169 --> 11:23.670
<i>Of course I knew</i>
<i>the answer to that.</i>

11:23.671 --> 11:25.272
<i>I was dating her.</i>

11:25.273 --> 11:28.275
But I wasn't about to ruin our
<i>first big romantic weekend away</i>

11:28.276 --> 11:29.676
<i>by bringing up the one topic</i>

11:29.677 --> 11:32.112
<i>we agreed was</i>
<i>completely off-limits.</i>

11:32.113 --> 11:34.781
You and The Arcadian are
ruining my life! What?

11:34.782 --> 11:36.199
I thought we weren't
talking about...

11:36.200 --> 11:37.734
We're talking about this.

11:37.735 --> 11:39.953
Look, I can handle you
trying to prevent me

11:39.954 --> 11:41.238
from fulfilling
a life-long dream.

11:41.239 --> 11:43.490
That's just being
in a relationship.

11:43.491 --> 11:45.459
But now? You turn my
best friend against me?

11:45.460 --> 11:47.694
Marshall made his own choice.
Why aren't you mad at him?

11:47.695 --> 11:49.329
Because he's going through
a lot right now.

11:49.330 --> 11:50.881
He, he's looking for
something to believe in,

11:50.882 --> 11:52.249
and you took advantage of that.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.167
You're, you're just like
those Internet swindlers

11:54.168 --> 11:55.719
who tricked him
into paying 300 bucks

11:55.720 --> 11:57.054
for a lock of Sasquatch fur.

11:57.055 --> 12:00.390
You cannot compare The Arcadian
to a Ziploc bag

12:00.391 --> 12:01.808
full of Turkish armpit hair.

12:01.809 --> 12:02.943
The Arcadian

12:02.944 --> 12:04.644
is a beautiful,
magnificent hotel.

12:04.645 --> 12:07.647
Okay. You know what? We're
settling this once and for all.

12:09.450 --> 12:10.817
Okay.

12:10.818 --> 12:12.986
We've cross-referenced
every alcohol

12:12.987 --> 12:14.955
with Marshall
and Barney's reaction.

12:14.956 --> 12:16.957
What's the right drink
for this situation?

12:16.958 --> 12:18.792
Well, they're not talking.

12:18.793 --> 12:20.293
They're not even looking
at each other.

12:20.294 --> 12:22.996
That reminds me of those
awkward Sunday dinners

12:22.997 --> 12:24.731
with my mom, my dad
and his mistress.

12:26.334 --> 12:27.634
Families, right?

12:27.635 --> 12:30.237
I-I guess. That...

12:30.238 --> 12:32.272
seems like a whole other thing.

12:33.174 --> 12:36.143
We need a drink that
will start a fight.

12:38.446 --> 12:40.914
Do you know what I had
to do to get you that job?

12:40.915 --> 12:42.182
Do you know what
I had to do

12:42.183 --> 12:43.583
to will myself to
show up every day?

12:43.584 --> 12:44.785
What, wear a wrinkled suit

12:44.786 --> 12:47.020
and not give a damn about
what your hair looked like?

12:47.021 --> 12:49.790
I showed up with wet hair <i>once!</i>

12:49.791 --> 12:50.891
<i>Once!</i>

12:50.892 --> 12:53.276
Oh, my God.

12:56.531 --> 12:58.782
Well, here we are.

12:58.783 --> 13:01.001
I had a reservation
at a four-star inn

13:01.002 --> 13:02.936
overlooking the ocean
but, uh...

13:02.937 --> 13:09.159
How can that compete with such a
beautiful, magnificent hotel?

13:14.415 --> 13:17.551
Welcome to
The Arcadian.

13:25.090 --> 13:26.857
So here's the deal.

13:26.858 --> 13:31.227
If you can last until sunrise
in your precious Arcadian,

13:31.232 --> 13:32.366
I'll join your side.

13:32.449 --> 13:33.716
You're on.

13:33.717 --> 13:35.685
This place is fantastic.

13:35.686 --> 13:37.586
They even left a chocolate
on the pillow.

13:37.587 --> 13:38.888
That's not a chocolate.

13:42.626 --> 13:44.293
Okay, now we need to
get them something

13:44.294 --> 13:46.195
that will make them
emotionally vulnerable

13:46.196 --> 13:47.830
and completely,
pathetically honest.

13:47.831 --> 13:49.365
Yeah, we need a drink that,

13:49.366 --> 13:52.401
that takes subtext and
turns it into text. Yeah.

13:55.839 --> 13:57.473
See, ever since
the death of my father,

13:57.474 --> 14:00.259
I have been drawn
to the idea of preservation.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.311
That's why The Arcadian
speaks to me.

14:02.312 --> 14:05.681
Ever since <i>my</i> father
walked out on my childhood,

14:05.682 --> 14:08.117
I've had serious
abandonment issues.

14:08.118 --> 14:09.735
You walking out
on me like that...

14:09.736 --> 14:11.287
Oh God, I didn't even
think of that...

14:11.288 --> 14:13.789
It made me wonder, "What could
I have done to make him stay?"

14:13.790 --> 14:16.359
Look, you didn't do anything
wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.760
That's what everyone
keeps saying

14:17.761 --> 14:19.195
but people just
keep leaving me.

14:23.066 --> 14:24.934
Wow. That got real o'clock.
Yeah.

14:24.935 --> 14:27.303
We need to get them up
and having fun.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.795
Dance, my puppets,
dance!

14:35.796 --> 14:37.880
Now do you see why
I'm always interfering

14:37.881 --> 14:39.315
in other people's lives?

14:39.316 --> 14:41.317
Oh, God, totally!

14:43.320 --> 14:45.554
Mm.
Please?

14:46.356 --> 14:49.358
Well, we're here for the night.

14:49.359 --> 14:51.727
Might as well have some fun.

14:51.728 --> 14:54.663
Care to join me?

14:54.664 --> 14:56.198
Dust just flew out
of that comforter

14:56.199 --> 14:57.700
in the shape of a skull.

14:58.769 --> 15:01.170
Whoa, something just
passed through me.

15:01.171 --> 15:04.206
Can you get STDs from
the ghost of a prostitute?

15:07.577 --> 15:08.844
What are...

15:08.845 --> 15:10.446
What are you doing
in our bathroom?

15:10.447 --> 15:13.549
WOMAN
This bathroom for entire floor!

15:17.387 --> 15:18.988
Okay. Final round.

15:18.989 --> 15:21.123
What simple act
will get the boys

15:21.124 --> 15:22.525
to finally forgive each other?

15:22.526 --> 15:24.093
Sharing a brandy.

15:24.094 --> 15:27.163
Which is what I walked in
on my parents doing once.

15:27.164 --> 15:29.231
Brandy was my
father's mistress.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.433
God, parents. Right?

15:30.434 --> 15:34.303
Again, just a whole
other thing, sweetie.

15:34.304 --> 15:35.871
Where'd they go?

15:35.872 --> 15:37.907
Oh, no.
They did shots.

15:37.908 --> 15:39.408
What? What is it?

15:39.409 --> 15:43.446
What's the worst thing they
could possibly drink right now?

15:49.953 --> 15:51.887
Your place or mi...

15:51.888 --> 15:55.291
Your place
or mi...

15:55.292 --> 15:57.760
Le-Let's go to
your place. Mm.

16:01.131 --> 16:04.366
<i>Kids, don't drink tequila.</i>

16:06.169 --> 16:08.938
Uh, these were supposed to
be for a romantic dinner

16:08.939 --> 16:10.539
on our balcony as we
were serenaded

16:10.540 --> 16:12.608
by the sounds of the ocean.

16:12.609 --> 16:14.877
But I guess we'll have to
settle for what sounded like

16:14.878 --> 16:18.247
two very large men
having sex next door...

16:18.248 --> 16:21.317
with a third very small man.

16:21.318 --> 16:22.551
I think that small man

16:22.552 --> 16:24.887
sounded very moved by
The Arcadian's beauty.

16:24.888 --> 16:27.756
Okay. What is it?

16:27.757 --> 16:30.192
And don't give me,
"It's beautiful."

16:30.193 --> 16:32.194
Don't give me,
"It's magnificent""

16:32.195 --> 16:34.430
What is it about this place

16:34.431 --> 16:36.799
that makes you so passionate
to save it?

16:41.538 --> 16:43.706
Well...

16:43.707 --> 16:47.243
When I was a little girl...

16:47.244 --> 16:49.211
my family used to live here.

16:49.212 --> 16:51.514
Why, why have you
never told me that?

16:51.515 --> 16:54.150
I never told anyone that.

16:54.151 --> 16:56.085
It makes it sound like
it would be impossible

16:56.086 --> 16:58.053
for me to be
objective, but...

17:00.023 --> 17:03.325
The truth is, I...

17:03.326 --> 17:05.461
I loved growing up here.

17:07.196 --> 17:09.298
We had just moved to New York.

17:09.299 --> 17:11.934
We were completely broke.

17:11.935 --> 17:14.737
But my mom told
my sisters and me

17:14.738 --> 17:16.539
that The Arcadian was a castle.

17:17.674 --> 17:19.608
And we believed her.

17:20.977 --> 17:25.915
I know it's not
what it used to be...

17:25.915 --> 17:29.952
but this building
is a part of who I am.

17:31.388 --> 17:34.089
And that's why I want so badly

17:34.090 --> 17:37.226
for you to like it, too.

17:37.227 --> 17:40.996
<i>Kids, you never forget</i>
<i>the first time-- or place--</i>

17:40.997 --> 17:42.731
<i>you tell a girl:</i>

17:42.732 --> 17:44.667
I love you.

17:44.668 --> 17:47.469
I love you, too.

17:56.646 --> 17:58.347
Come on in, you're un-banned.

17:58.348 --> 17:59.448
I gave these guys

17:59.449 --> 18:01.750
some drinks and they calmed down
and made up.

18:01.751 --> 18:04.053
Well, what drink
finally did the trick?

18:05.956 --> 18:08.023
Of course,

18:08.024 --> 18:08.991
beer.
Beer.

18:08.992 --> 18:12.061
I love you.
I love <i>you.</i>

18:13.330 --> 18:14.730
Uh, no. N-Not right...

18:17.033 --> 18:18.300
You know,

18:18.301 --> 18:20.869
I guess this place isn't so bad.

18:20.870 --> 18:23.405
See? With a little renovation,
we could restore it

18:23.406 --> 18:24.340
to its former...

18:24.341 --> 18:25.975
What was that?
What was what?

18:25.976 --> 18:27.743
I think it went under the bed.
Yeah.

18:27.744 --> 18:28.544
I don't see anything.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.348
That, that was...
that!

18:32.349 --> 18:34.183
Oh, my God!

18:34.184 --> 18:35.884
It's the cock-a-mouse!

18:35.885 --> 18:37.353
The what?

18:37.354 --> 18:38.787
Cock-a-mouse.

18:38.788 --> 18:41.924
Part cockroach,
part mouse.

18:41.925 --> 18:43.659
It used to live
in our apartment.

18:43.660 --> 18:46.095
It must have settled
here, and... Oh!

18:46.096 --> 18:47.896
Look, it had babies!
Good for it.

18:49.232 --> 18:51.216
Ew....

18:51.217 --> 18:53.302
I give up. You win. Let's go!

18:56.022 --> 18:58.207
Be well, my friends!

19:03.647 --> 19:06.181
Aw, just how we left them.

19:06.182 --> 19:08.400
Morning.

19:08.401 --> 19:10.219
Who wants breakfast?

19:10.220 --> 19:12.204
You have some coffee?

19:12.205 --> 19:15.291
So I can throw it in
this traitor's face?

19:15.292 --> 19:17.710
Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey!
Do you guys have some

19:17.711 --> 19:21.130
pancakes, because I... would
really like some pancakes.

19:21.131 --> 19:23.265
They're fantastic. Let's
be honest, I love them.

19:23.266 --> 19:24.900
But I hate this guy!

19:24.901 --> 19:27.036
I thought they
made up last night.

19:27.037 --> 19:29.338
Damn it, I know what happened.

19:29.339 --> 19:32.675
I love you.
I love <i>you.</i>

19:33.810 --> 19:35.227
Uh, no. N-not right...

19:36.813 --> 19:38.047
Carl,

19:38.048 --> 19:40.316
a round of champagne.
Ooh!

19:40.317 --> 19:41.617
The champagne.

19:41.618 --> 19:43.185
We gave them one drink too many.

19:43.186 --> 19:45.120
They must've blacked out
and forgotten the whole thing.

19:45.121 --> 19:46.888
What kind of dirtbag

19:46.889 --> 19:48.924
doesn't stand by
his best friends,

19:48.925 --> 19:52.428
but instead sides with
some self-righteous bitch

19:52.429 --> 19:55.164
with a pointless cause and a megaphone?
Dude.

19:55.165 --> 19:57.433
That's my girlfriend.

19:57.434 --> 20:00.002
And you know what?

20:00.003 --> 20:02.871
I'm on her side now, too.

20:04.090 --> 20:06.975
Whoa, whoa, you have got
to be kidding me. Ted...

20:06.976 --> 20:08.911
Okay, what drink can fix this?

20:08.912 --> 20:10.295
Mama's done with this drama.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.449
What drink can fix the headache
these clowns are giving me?

20:13.450 --> 20:16.118
I got it.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.589
Right?

20:20.590 --> 20:23.308
Time is music the planets make.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.393
Music the planets make...

20:41.013 --> 20:43.915
What is that?
