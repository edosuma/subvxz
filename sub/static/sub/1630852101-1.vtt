00:00.127 --> 00:03.210
(film reel clicking)

00:07.245 --> 00:09.828
(solemn music)

00:22.717 --> 00:25.384
(shovels thump)

00:30.516 --> 00:34.183
(solemn instrumental music)

00:37.730 --> 00:40.070
- [Teddy] Deep in the
Appalachian Mountains,

00:40.070 --> 00:42.913
people here, they play by their own rules.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.770
There are secrets that
never leave these hills.

00:46.770 --> 00:50.930
Summer of 1929 was the year I turned 13,

00:50.930 --> 00:55.330
a summer of loss, fear, and
the beginning of a new chapter.

00:55.330 --> 00:57.620
I lost my father in a railroad accident,

00:57.620 --> 01:00.763
and I became the man of the
house while still a child.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.520
- [Both] Ready, set!

01:03.520 --> 01:05.519
- [Teddy] My best friend, Willy Stamper,

01:05.519 --> 01:08.610
lived up on Adam's Ridge.
(water splashes)

01:08.610 --> 01:11.840
His daddy hated mine, never knew why.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.890
They had a feud between them
since me and Willy was born.

01:14.890 --> 01:16.257
Do you, William John Stamper

01:16.257 --> 01:19.050
accept the Lord Jesus
Christ as your savior?

01:19.050 --> 01:20.770
- Oh yes, Lord.

01:20.770 --> 01:22.770
Please, forgive me.

01:22.770 --> 01:25.450
- And do your repent for all your sins?

01:25.450 --> 01:28.360
- Yes, Lord, please forgive me.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.130
- [Teddy] But Mama, she
always let Willy come over.

01:32.130 --> 01:34.301
We were as tight as shoe leather

01:34.301 --> 01:37.259
until one day that
would change everything.

01:42.048 --> 01:44.965
(melancholy music)

01:51.239 --> 01:54.906
(majestic orchestral music)

02:09.779 --> 02:12.362
(bright music)

02:16.210 --> 02:17.043
Willy!

02:21.060 --> 02:24.850
Willy!
- Shh!

02:24.850 --> 02:28.023
Teddy, if I don't make it back home alive,

02:28.957 --> 02:31.340
you gotta tell my girl I love her.

02:33.525 --> 02:36.108
(bright music)

02:39.173 --> 02:40.613
Incoming!

02:40.613 --> 02:43.113
(Willy spits)

02:44.454 --> 02:45.288
No!

02:45.288 --> 02:47.871
(Willy grunts)

02:49.770 --> 02:51.776
- Damn it, Willy.

02:51.776 --> 02:53.290
You always die first.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.110
I never get to die first.

02:55.110 --> 02:57.640
- Come on, come back.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.667
Can't you tell my legs
are full of shrapnel!

02:59.667 --> 03:01.667
I could shoot you from here and lame ya.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.117
- [Teddy] I'm going swimming.

03:04.540 --> 03:05.373
- Wait up!

03:06.886 --> 03:10.553
(majestic orchestral music)

03:19.766 --> 03:23.183
- The water is so cold.
- Yeah, I tell ya.

03:27.260 --> 03:30.923
- We better pick up the
pace, we can't be too late.

03:30.923 --> 03:32.523
- Why is he always so mad?

03:33.810 --> 03:35.090
- Who?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.610
- Your daddy.

03:36.610 --> 03:38.060
- Buck?

03:38.060 --> 03:39.710
I don't know.

03:39.710 --> 03:41.787
Think it might be all that drinkin'.

03:43.329 --> 03:46.843
First the war, then Mama left him.

03:48.386 --> 03:50.036
You lucky you don't have a daddy.

03:52.110 --> 03:53.023
- Take it back.

03:53.870 --> 03:54.703
- What?

03:54.703 --> 03:56.760
- I said take it back right now.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.773
- Jeez Louise, Teddy, don't
got your panties in a bunch.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.003
I just meant your lucky you
don't have a daddy that hits ya.

04:06.655 --> 04:10.460
I guess any daddy's better than no daddy.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.543
- My daddy was a good
man, salt of the earth.

04:16.017 --> 04:17.667
You think we got enough crawdads?

04:19.600 --> 04:20.433
- Probably not.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.373
I can handle the Buck,

04:22.373 --> 04:24.850
just make sure he's got plenty of drink.

04:24.850 --> 04:26.150
He'll be asleep all night.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.133
Teddy, look!

04:34.280 --> 04:35.374
- [Teddy] What?

04:35.374 --> 04:36.590
- A quarter.

04:36.590 --> 04:37.490
- Let me see that.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.913
Wow, a real quarter.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.034
- This is going in my getaway jar.

04:45.034 --> 04:45.963
- Your what?

04:47.020 --> 04:48.830
- I got a jar under my porch.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.480
It's full of every change I find.

04:51.350 --> 04:53.486
One of these days I'm
gonna run off from here.

04:53.486 --> 04:54.396
I ain't never coming back.

04:55.571 --> 04:57.220
- You can't leave me, Willy.

04:57.220 --> 04:59.754
You're my best friend,
what'll do I do without you?

04:59.754 --> 05:00.921
- Jeez, Teddy.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.248
Hey.

05:05.248 --> 05:06.415
I got an idea.

05:11.505 --> 05:14.486
(Willy groans)

05:14.486 --> 05:16.620
Give me your hand, come on now.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.890
- What are we like, eight?

05:18.890 --> 05:21.777
- Well, I already cut myself
so you ain't backin' out now.

05:23.545 --> 05:25.962
(boys groan)

05:27.349 --> 05:29.870
Now, we're full-on blood brothers.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.470
Can't nobody ever take us apart.

05:33.497 --> 05:35.500
- That stings.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.110
Mama's not gonna like this.

05:37.110 --> 05:38.898
She's gonna think I was being careless.

05:38.898 --> 05:40.053
- She'll be all right.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.006
- She lost her husband and her baby.

05:44.006 --> 05:45.606
Maybe we can cut her some slack.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
- Come on, let's go.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.650
- That's it?

06:01.650 --> 06:02.580
- Yup.

06:02.580 --> 06:03.693
That's my getaway jar.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.490
- Why is it full of dirt?

06:08.490 --> 06:09.490
- It's not all dirt.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.203
Feel how heavy.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.631
'Cause if Buck finds it,

06:15.631 --> 06:18.460
he'll think it's a jar of
dried money nightcrawlers.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.513
But really it's my jar of get away money.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.920
Pretty smart, huh?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.260
- Yeah.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.620
So you water it down every
time you add money to it?

06:26.620 --> 06:27.670
- Yes, sir.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.090
Sometimes when he sleeps,

06:29.090 --> 06:31.920
I can get some change from his pockets.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.753
He never knows.

06:34.150 --> 06:36.271
Dimes are my favorite 'cause they're small

06:36.271 --> 06:37.371
and they add up quick.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.003
He never notices a few
dimes here and there.

06:43.183 --> 06:45.193
- How much you think you got in there?

06:45.193 --> 06:48.970
- Hard to say, but I'm getting close.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.013
- [Buck] That you boy?

06:50.900 --> 06:51.733
Get on in here.

06:55.260 --> 06:56.263
- Ah shit.

06:57.220 --> 06:58.993
- You wanna have supper at my house?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.610
- So, then Teddy gave me three dips.

07:04.610 --> 07:06.587
That should get me in, right?

07:06.587 --> 07:08.700
- I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you boys.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.240
You know this can get infected.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.340
- That's what I told him,
and he didn't listen.

07:13.340 --> 07:14.270
- [Willy] It's fine.

07:14.270 --> 07:16.880
- All right, well you're clean for now.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.623
I'm sure it won't stay that way.

07:20.370 --> 07:22.570
- Hey Willy, you want to go
catch some lightning bugs?

07:22.570 --> 07:23.470
- [Willy] Oh yeah.

07:24.450 --> 07:25.450
- [Clara] All right.

07:27.487 --> 07:28.474
- [Teddy] Come on.

07:28.474 --> 07:31.259
(footsteps patter)

07:31.259 --> 07:34.009
(crickets chirp)

07:35.481 --> 07:38.398
(footsteps patter)

07:43.258 --> 07:45.841
(light clicks)

07:47.126 --> 07:49.200
- Where you been, boy?

07:49.200 --> 07:51.716
- Me and Teddy was
catching lightning bugs.

07:51.716 --> 07:52.650
- Well, I can see that.

07:52.650 --> 07:53.500
I'm not an idiot.

07:54.490 --> 07:55.563
Wipe your face.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.083
So you with that boy, that bastard boy?

08:03.169 --> 08:04.503
- His daddy died.

08:08.186 --> 08:09.400
(ominous music)

08:09.400 --> 08:11.600
- So you went to that
Smallwood place again?

08:12.873 --> 08:14.138
- No, sir.

08:14.138 --> 08:16.155
(hand slaps)

08:16.155 --> 08:18.853
- Don't you lie to me, you hear me?

08:18.853 --> 08:19.813
- Yes, sir.

08:21.380 --> 08:23.167
- Go clean up, get to bed.

08:25.729 --> 08:28.646
(train horn honks)

08:30.245 --> 08:32.828
(solemn music)

08:38.131 --> 08:40.495
(horn whistles)

08:40.495 --> 08:43.078
(solemn music)

08:47.504 --> 08:50.004
(train chugs)

08:54.851 --> 08:57.236
(train carriages thud)
(whistle blows)

08:57.236 --> 08:58.144
- Dad!

08:58.144 --> 09:00.216
(Teddy gasps)

09:00.216 --> 09:02.716
(birds chirp)

09:21.847 --> 09:23.490
- [Willy] Gotcha! (laughs)

09:23.490 --> 09:24.888
- Dang it, Willy.

09:24.888 --> 09:26.000
You know what Buck might've done

09:26.000 --> 09:28.008
if he saw me peaking in
his window like that?

09:28.008 --> 09:30.900
- (laughs) Oh, he ain't gonna hurt nobody.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.486
He's out like a light.

09:32.486 --> 09:33.713
- What happened to you?

09:34.930 --> 09:37.040
- I guess we didn't get enough crawdads.

09:37.040 --> 09:37.873
- He hit you?

09:39.420 --> 09:40.347
- Oh, I got him good.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.140
I peed in his drink.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.140
He's so drunk he don't even notice.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.123
- That's not funny, Willy.

09:45.123 --> 09:47.070
Look at your eye.

09:47.070 --> 09:48.330
- Here you go.

09:48.330 --> 09:49.640
Breakfast?

09:49.640 --> 09:52.010
- No thanks, they'll give me the runs.

09:52.010 --> 09:53.246
You too if you're not careful.

09:53.246 --> 09:54.246
- Not me.

09:54.246 --> 09:55.533
(teeth crunch)

09:55.533 --> 09:59.660
Guts of steel!
(hand taps)

09:59.660 --> 10:02.033
- So, what do you want to do today?

10:02.033 --> 10:06.163
- I got an idea, let's have some fun.

10:07.252 --> 10:09.203
Hold my apple.

10:09.203 --> 10:11.870
(playful music)

10:26.771 --> 10:29.354
(bright music)

10:30.492 --> 10:31.453
- Willy!

10:32.500 --> 10:35.070
Buck's gonna kill us if he
finds us playing with his gun.

10:35.070 --> 10:37.663
- Come on, don't be a scaredy cat.

10:37.663 --> 10:39.028
You getting soft on me?

10:39.028 --> 10:39.948
- No.

10:39.948 --> 10:41.550
- Come on!

10:41.550 --> 10:42.979
- Willy!

10:42.979 --> 10:45.729
(sighs) Wait up.

10:50.895 --> 10:53.005
(gunshot pops)
(body thuds)

10:53.005 --> 10:56.748
(Teddy groans)
(Willy laughs)

10:56.748 --> 11:00.360
- Oh, Teddy, I thought you
was gonna piss yourself.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.731
- What?

11:01.731 --> 11:02.943
I can't hear a thing.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.150
- [Willy] You done gone deaf soon.

11:06.150 --> 11:09.033
- I just wasn't ready, that's all.

11:10.580 --> 11:13.770
- Here, let me show you how to do it.

11:13.770 --> 11:15.300
See that coffee mug?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.563
I'm gonna get that one.

11:19.465 --> 11:20.660
(gunshot pops)

11:20.660 --> 11:22.123
- [Teddy] Ha, you missed!

11:23.050 --> 11:25.083
- I'll get it this time, you watch.

11:27.925 --> 11:29.033
(gunshot pops)

11:29.033 --> 11:31.140
(can rattles)

11:31.140 --> 11:31.973
Yeah!

11:31.973 --> 11:35.030
Told you so, got it
square between the eyes!

11:35.030 --> 11:35.863
- Okay.

11:35.863 --> 11:36.696
Come on, let me try.

11:44.277 --> 11:47.027
(trigger clicks)

11:49.023 --> 11:50.423
I think we're outta bullets.

11:51.460 --> 11:56.460
- Hey, how adventurous you feeling?

11:56.630 --> 11:57.813
- Should I be worried?

11:59.035 --> 12:02.035
(adventurous music)

12:03.502 --> 12:04.335
- Come on!

12:07.974 --> 12:10.391
(boys grunt)

12:17.769 --> 12:18.882
(tractor idling)

12:18.882 --> 12:20.715
Listen, you hear that?

12:22.420 --> 12:24.492
- Yeah, sounds like a tractor.

12:24.492 --> 12:26.014
- Come on, let's go!

12:26.014 --> 12:27.132
- Wait.
- Come on!

12:27.132 --> 12:28.032
- No, wait, Willy.

12:30.185 --> 12:35.185
(tense music)
(tractor idling)

12:39.000 --> 12:41.087
- Teddy, he left it idling.

12:42.411 --> 12:43.363
- Okay, so?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.238
- Come on, let's go.

12:46.238 --> 12:48.637
- We can't just go take it.

12:48.637 --> 12:52.183
- Teddy, it's like he's begging
for us to just go ride it.

12:52.183 --> 12:53.016
Let's go, come on!

12:53.016 --> 12:54.012
- No, we can't just ride it.

12:54.012 --> 12:54.845
Wait, Willy.

12:54.845 --> 12:56.353
- I'm going with or without you.

12:57.705 --> 12:58.952
(bright music)

12:58.952 --> 12:59.785
- Willy!

13:03.695 --> 13:04.860
- Climb up here.

13:04.860 --> 13:06.544
- Me?
- Yes, you.

13:06.544 --> 13:07.723
Come on.

13:07.723 --> 13:10.473
(tractor idles)

13:11.430 --> 13:12.950
All right.

13:12.950 --> 13:14.010
First, release the break.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.675
Then you pull a little on the throttle.

13:15.675 --> 13:17.100
- This thing?

13:17.100 --> 13:18.248
- That's it.

13:18.248 --> 13:21.048
Now, it ain't easy, but you
gotta get it out of neutral.

13:22.230 --> 13:23.093
Put it into gear.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.273
(tractor engine hums)

13:28.273 --> 13:29.619
Throttle, throttle!

13:29.619 --> 13:32.163
- I'm trying.

13:32.163 --> 13:35.163
(chuckles) Woo hoo!

13:36.672 --> 13:38.589
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

13:39.428 --> 13:40.511
I'm getting it!

13:40.511 --> 13:43.650
I'm like a tank! (roars)

13:43.650 --> 13:46.022
- You shoot the missiles and
I'll take the ground cover.

13:46.022 --> 13:47.022
- Yeah, woo!

13:48.371 --> 13:49.400
- Come on, pick it up!

13:49.400 --> 13:52.201
- I can't go any faster!

13:52.201 --> 13:54.620
- I can literally run circles around you.

13:54.620 --> 13:59.447
- I'm going through the compound!

13:59.447 --> 14:00.280
Woo!

14:02.393 --> 14:04.976
(Teddy laughs)

14:12.226 --> 14:15.665
(suspenseful music)

14:15.665 --> 14:17.137
Woo!

14:17.137 --> 14:17.995
Yeah!

14:17.995 --> 14:19.078
Willy, Willy!

14:20.153 --> 14:21.537
Willy!

14:21.537 --> 14:23.370
Willy, stop, stop, no!

14:24.244 --> 14:25.567
Willy!

14:25.567 --> 14:26.750
Willy, stop!

14:26.750 --> 14:28.250
Help, help, Willy!

14:30.003 --> 14:31.503
Willy, stop, stop!

14:32.742 --> 14:33.575
No!

14:33.575 --> 14:38.575
♪ Just as I am, without one plea ♪

14:40.990 --> 14:45.990
♪ But that Thy blood was shed for me ♪

14:48.364 --> 14:53.364
♪ And that Thou bid'st me come to thee ♪

14:55.117 --> 15:00.117
♪ Oh lamb of God, I come ♪

15:01.522 --> 15:03.605
♪ I come ♪

15:05.464 --> 15:07.964
(birds chirp)

15:11.980 --> 15:12.813
- Folks.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.580
These services are probably the hardest

15:16.580 --> 15:17.680
for me to get through.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.180
It ain't right

15:21.530 --> 15:25.090
that any parent should ever
say goodbye to their child.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.637
But Jesus said, "Let
the children come to me

15:27.637 --> 15:29.457
"and do not hinder them."

15:30.510 --> 15:33.193
For to such they belong
to the kingdom of heaven.

15:35.750 --> 15:40.750
He heals the brokenhearted
and binds up their wounds.

15:43.820 --> 15:48.270
For this child, I prayed
and was granted my petition.

15:48.270 --> 15:52.010
Therefore, I have lent him to the Lord.

15:52.010 --> 15:52.843
- Enough.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.083
Open it.

16:05.240 --> 16:08.418
- Mr. Stamper, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

16:08.418 --> 16:10.803
That little fellow's in some rough shape.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.563
- I don't remember asking
you, now do I, Pastor?

16:16.493 --> 16:18.873
So if you'd so kindly do as I ask

16:18.873 --> 16:21.983
and open up the goddamn
casket before I kick it open.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.733
(tense music)

16:42.915 --> 16:43.999
- Don't look.

16:49.113 --> 16:51.696
(solemn music)

16:55.662 --> 16:58.995
(Teddy whimpers softly)

17:03.082 --> 17:07.406
- Look at him.

17:07.406 --> 17:08.428
Look at him!

17:08.428 --> 17:10.928
(Teddy cries)

17:12.529 --> 17:15.626
You did this.

17:15.626 --> 17:16.972
You did this.

17:16.972 --> 17:18.500
- Teddy!

17:18.500 --> 17:20.359
- You killed my boy!

17:20.359 --> 17:22.416
You killed my boy!

17:25.280 --> 17:27.863
(solemn music)

17:34.948 --> 17:37.365
(shoes thud)

17:38.769 --> 17:41.352
(solemn music)

17:45.709 --> 17:49.042
(Teddy whimpers softly)

18:03.207 --> 18:05.290
- Now, let's have a look.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.043
- What you working on?

18:12.281 --> 18:14.063
- Just a silly little drawing.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.180
- Hey, don't sell
yourself short, young man.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.310
You are quite the artist.

18:20.310 --> 18:21.860
Your daddy loved your drawings.

18:22.746 --> 18:24.525
(car engine hums)

18:24.525 --> 18:27.025
(tense music)

18:29.504 --> 18:31.192
- Mom, it's Buck.

18:31.192 --> 18:32.420
He's got a gun.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.230
- Teddy, take the girls to their room.

18:34.230 --> 18:35.433
Girls, go with Teddy.

18:36.591 --> 18:41.591
(tense music)
(crickets chirp)

18:46.200 --> 18:47.793
Can I help you, Mr. Stamper?

18:48.890 --> 18:50.163
- Send that boy out here.

18:51.650 --> 18:53.150
- Mr. Stamper, I think
you had a little bit

18:53.150 --> 18:54.133
too much to drink.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.274
- Don't you tell me anything, woman.

18:57.274 --> 18:59.986
I said send that boy out here right now.

18:59.986 --> 19:01.580
- I will do no such thing.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.406
Now you best be leaving my home.

19:04.406 --> 19:06.906
(rifle cocks)

19:08.629 --> 19:10.923
- The way I see it, you got two choices.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.450
You either send that boy
out here and I kill him,

19:15.376 --> 19:16.933
or you give that boy to me.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.380
It's the only right way.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.597
It's the only right
way, an eye for an eye.

19:25.050 --> 19:28.380
Your boy killed mine, now I kill yours.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.420
- [Clara] You ain't taking my boy.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.487
- I'll kill him, it's your choice.

19:32.487 --> 19:34.590
- Like hell you will.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.090
(tense music)

19:41.892 --> 19:46.423
What happened to Willy was
tragic, but it was an accident.

19:47.974 --> 19:52.513
I know you are in pain,
but my Teddy loved him.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.300
I loved him.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.653
You aren't the only one mourning here.

19:59.610 --> 20:03.803
So, I advise you to go
home and sleep it off.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.420
- You don't preach to me.

20:12.729 --> 20:16.032
Now that boy's coming
with me, dead or alive.

20:16.032 --> 20:18.232
And if I have to take
all you out, so be it.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.250
I got enough bullets.

20:24.177 --> 20:26.050
- It's okay, Mom, I'll go.

20:27.715 --> 20:30.215
(tense music)

20:32.655 --> 20:34.869
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

20:34.869 --> 20:37.918
- Teddy, you get back
inside, he can't take you.

20:37.918 --> 20:39.281
You get back inside.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.528
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- Teddy, no.

20:41.528 --> 20:43.757
Teddy, let him go!

20:43.757 --> 20:45.448
Let him go!
- Please stop!

20:45.448 --> 20:49.262
(Clara shouts)
(Buck groans)

20:49.262 --> 20:51.795
(foot thuds)
(Buck grunts)

20:51.795 --> 20:54.257
(Teddy shouts)

20:54.257 --> 20:55.090
- No, Mom!

20:56.497 --> 20:59.018
(Buck grunts)
(motor hums)

20:59.018 --> 21:00.376
- Teddy!

21:00.376 --> 21:01.857
Girls, get back in the house!

21:01.857 --> 21:04.225
Get back in the house, lock the door!

21:04.225 --> 21:05.535
Lock the door!

21:05.535 --> 21:06.952
No, Teddy, Teddy.

21:09.531 --> 21:10.364
- Mom!

21:10.364 --> 21:11.197
- Huh?

21:11.197 --> 21:12.293
- No, no, don't hurt her, please!

21:12.293 --> 21:13.637
- He's my boy now.

21:14.566 --> 21:17.614
You say goodbye, son.

21:17.614 --> 21:19.757
He'll never come back.

21:19.757 --> 21:21.140
- Teddy, no, don't!

21:21.140 --> 21:22.836
You son of a bitch!

21:22.836 --> 21:25.223
No, Teddy!

21:25.223 --> 21:27.806
(solemn music)

21:29.378 --> 21:30.211
No!

21:31.534 --> 21:35.367
No! (cries)

21:38.999 --> 21:41.999
(suspenseful music)

21:43.490 --> 21:44.323
- Get out.

21:45.668 --> 21:46.501
Get out.

21:48.761 --> 21:50.234
Get up.

21:50.234 --> 21:51.401
I said get up!

21:53.204 --> 21:58.204
(Teddy groans)
(Buck grunts)

21:59.380 --> 22:02.020
(latch rattles)

22:02.020 --> 22:05.570
(footsteps patter)

22:05.570 --> 22:07.781
Welcome to your new home, boy.

22:07.781 --> 22:08.863
Way I see it.

22:09.970 --> 22:11.820
If my boy has to sleep in the ground,

22:12.767 --> 22:14.833
you sure as hell could sleep on it.

22:15.980 --> 22:18.796
(door creaks)

22:18.796 --> 22:23.796
(Teddy whimpers)
(lock rattles)

22:25.185 --> 22:27.685
(Teddy cries)

22:38.289 --> 22:39.546
(birds chirp)

22:39.546 --> 22:42.213
(rooster crows)

22:44.615 --> 22:47.420
(door creaks)

22:47.420 --> 22:48.253
Get up.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.680
I said get up, come on, boy.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.410
You're not gonna be lazy around here.

22:53.410 --> 22:54.360
There's work to do.

22:55.210 --> 22:57.410
Now get out to that
coop, bring in the eggs.

22:58.867 --> 23:01.764
You ain't so ignorant you
can't figure that out, right?

23:01.764 --> 23:02.681
- Yes, sir.

23:04.501 --> 23:06.467
(rooster crows)

23:06.467 --> 23:08.634
- I said git, come on now.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.240
What is wrong with you, boy?

23:16.280 --> 23:17.210
You messed up in the head

23:17.210 --> 23:19.653
or do I have to get my belt on you?

23:19.653 --> 23:20.793
- I have to pee.

23:22.210 --> 23:24.365
- Well, you know where the woods are.

23:24.365 --> 23:26.765
Now, get to them chickens
and bring in the eggs.

23:27.650 --> 23:28.963
I like mine over easy.

23:32.915 --> 23:34.270
And don't break my yolk.

23:39.055 --> 23:41.264
(rooster crows)

23:41.264 --> 23:46.014
(cars hum)
(heels clack)

23:51.595 --> 23:54.095
(door creaks)

23:55.246 --> 23:57.746
(heels clack)

23:59.131 --> 24:00.403
(doorknob rattles)

24:00.403 --> 24:02.257
(hand bangs)

24:02.257 --> 24:03.381
- Hello?

24:03.381 --> 24:05.537
(hand bangs)

24:05.537 --> 24:08.370
(spatula scrapes)

24:13.951 --> 24:16.701
(spatula clangs)

24:22.432 --> 24:25.182
(plate clatters)

24:29.921 --> 24:32.754
(coffee splashes)

24:42.813 --> 24:45.563
(plate clatters)

24:49.988 --> 24:52.488
(toast snaps)

24:57.755 --> 25:00.338
(teeth crunch)

25:07.471 --> 25:10.304
(coffee splashes)

25:17.934 --> 25:20.767
(liquor splashes)

25:26.076 --> 25:29.344
(fork scrapes)

25:29.344 --> 25:32.261
(footsteps patter)

25:36.786 --> 25:37.750
- Sheriff.

25:37.750 --> 25:38.810
- I'm the deputy.

25:38.810 --> 25:40.239
- He took my son.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.150
- Hold on now.

25:41.150 --> 25:44.044
You say somebody took your boy?

25:44.044 --> 25:46.680
- Yes, Mr. Buck Stamper,
up on Adams Ridge.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.263
- Stamper.
- He took my Teddy.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.538
- He's the one who lost his boy, right?

25:51.538 --> 25:53.033
- Yes, please.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.173
You have to help me.

25:56.170 --> 25:57.930
- Now, Ma'am, I reckon
this is a better job

25:57.930 --> 25:59.740
for the sheriff himself.

25:59.740 --> 26:01.312
- Fine, where is he?

26:01.312 --> 26:03.676
- Well, now he's in Charlottesville,

26:03.676 --> 26:05.193
and he'll be back tomorrow.

26:06.724 --> 26:08.560
- You have to do something.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.639
He is going to kill my boy.

26:10.639 --> 26:12.894
- (sighs) My hands are tied.

26:12.894 --> 26:15.343
I promise you, the sheriff
will take care of it.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.881
Now why don't you run along back home,

26:17.881 --> 26:19.700
and I'm going to call him in the morning.

26:19.700 --> 26:21.900
- You're not gonna do nothing?

26:21.900 --> 26:24.523
- Ma'am, I suggest you calm down.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.410
Now that man is suffering,

26:27.410 --> 26:30.450
and he's just lashing
out at your boy, okay?

26:30.450 --> 26:31.400
We'll handle everything.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.550
- You better pray hard
my son is all right.

26:35.960 --> 26:36.793
- Oh, I'll pray.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.166
You should pray too.

26:41.303 --> 26:44.553
After all, he did kill his boy.

26:47.876 --> 26:48.978
(door slams)

26:48.978 --> 26:49.811
- Coward!

26:51.296 --> 26:53.963
(broom scrapes)

26:56.782 --> 26:59.199
(shoes thud)

27:00.590 --> 27:01.423
- Sit.

27:02.463 --> 27:03.563
I said sit.

27:10.130 --> 27:13.050
You ain't walking around this
farm with that long hair.

27:13.050 --> 27:16.800
It ain't clean, and you ain't
bringing lice into my home.

27:19.210 --> 27:20.710
You best be still.

27:26.330 --> 27:28.913
(bird warbles)

27:30.038 --> 27:32.705
(chain rattles)

27:35.467 --> 27:36.717
You better eat somethin'.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.763
You're gonna need your
energy for tomorrow.

27:40.633 --> 27:42.620
You can make a bed out
of one of them bales.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.423
Get another blanket from the horse.

27:50.850 --> 27:53.517
(chain rattles)

28:00.603 --> 28:02.670
(dramatic music)

28:02.670 --> 28:04.313
- I'm coming home, Mama.

28:05.381 --> 28:08.214
(thrilling music)

28:10.571 --> 28:12.873
(door thumps)

28:12.873 --> 28:15.706
(thrilling music)

28:23.897 --> 28:26.480
(hand scrapes)

28:32.049 --> 28:35.232
(thrilling music)

28:35.232 --> 28:36.210
(footsteps patter)

28:36.210 --> 28:37.173
- I see you, boy.

28:42.157 --> 28:45.557
(suspenseful music)

28:45.557 --> 28:48.474
(footsteps patter)

28:53.498 --> 28:54.964
(Teddy groans)

28:54.964 --> 28:56.270
You think you could get away from me?

28:56.270 --> 28:58.007
I own you, boy, come on!

28:58.007 --> 28:59.966
- Ow, ah, stop!

28:59.966 --> 29:01.834
Please, please stop!

29:01.834 --> 29:03.435
Ah, ah!

29:03.435 --> 29:08.435
(belt whips)
(Teddy screams)

29:08.599 --> 29:11.273
No, ow, why are you doing this to me?

29:11.273 --> 29:13.378
Why? (screams)

29:13.378 --> 29:15.208
- [Buck] 'Cause you killed my boy.

29:15.208 --> 29:17.736
You killed my boy!
- No, no, ow!

29:17.736 --> 29:20.736
Please, stop!
- The only thing I had.

29:21.981 --> 29:23.220
Huh, you hear me?

29:23.220 --> 29:26.430
You don't ever try to
run away from me again.

29:26.430 --> 29:29.386
If you do, I'll take one
of them sisters of yours.

29:29.386 --> 29:33.106
If they run away, I'll take your Mama.

29:33.106 --> 29:33.961
Get up.

29:33.961 --> 29:34.961
Huh, get up.

29:36.639 --> 29:41.505
(Teddy shouts)
(Buck grunts)

29:41.505 --> 29:46.505
(Buck grunts)
(Teddy groans)

29:47.260 --> 29:48.594
I had a fine boy.

29:48.594 --> 29:51.173
He was good, and now I got you.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.263
Pathetic.

29:54.143 --> 29:56.457
You ain't half the boy Willy was.

29:58.634 --> 30:01.504
(Teddy cries)

30:01.504 --> 30:04.024
(door creaks)

30:04.024 --> 30:06.524
(Teddy cries)

30:11.133 --> 30:16.133
(engine hums)
(tires rumble)

30:29.166 --> 30:31.916
(car doors thud)

30:42.489 --> 30:44.989
(door creaks)

30:46.260 --> 30:48.450
Morning, Sheriff.

30:48.450 --> 30:50.450
Little early for a house call, ain't it?

30:51.507 --> 30:53.123
- Morning, Mr. Stamper.

30:54.250 --> 30:55.783
Sorry to hear about your son.

30:58.950 --> 31:01.720
I got Ms. Rogers here.

31:01.720 --> 31:06.720
She tells me you came and
took her boy against his will.

31:07.690 --> 31:09.297
Is that true?

31:09.297 --> 31:11.837
- Why don't you ask him yourself?

31:11.837 --> 31:15.262
(Teddy grunts)
(shoes thud)

31:15.262 --> 31:16.712
- What happened to you, baby?

31:17.980 --> 31:20.810
- Now, boy, you want to tell
me what's going on here?

31:20.810 --> 31:24.943
You got your Mama mighty
shooken up about this.

31:30.370 --> 31:31.633
You afraid to talk, boy?

31:34.140 --> 31:35.800
What happened to your face?

31:35.800 --> 31:38.120
- Teddy, come on, let's go, baby.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.420
He can't hurt you no more.

31:41.460 --> 31:42.580
- Now, Buck.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.360
I don't know what you have in mind here,

31:44.360 --> 31:46.373
but that boy ain't yours.

31:47.970 --> 31:48.860
He belongs...

31:48.860 --> 31:50.260
- No!
- Home with his Mama.

31:53.260 --> 31:54.483
- I fell off the truck.

31:57.726 --> 31:59.326
- [Sheriff] What'd you say, boy?

32:02.567 --> 32:04.973
- I said I want to stay here.

32:06.319 --> 32:07.873
This is where Willy was.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.950
I don't want to go back with you.

32:14.857 --> 32:19.070
- Now, it seems like we've
arrived at an impasse.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.760
You heard the boy.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.023
He wants to stay here.

32:24.450 --> 32:26.433
- Boy, why don't you want to go home?

32:27.280 --> 32:28.463
- This is my home.

32:29.820 --> 32:32.521
I don't want to be with a bunch of girls.

32:32.521 --> 32:34.473
I need a man in my life.

32:36.690 --> 32:38.640
If you brought me back, I'd just run away.

32:44.850 --> 32:47.330
- Now, we'll just give him a few days.

32:47.330 --> 32:48.590
- No, that is my son,

32:48.590 --> 32:50.670
and I am not leaving here without him.

32:50.670 --> 32:53.086
- Now, now, you heard the boy!

32:53.086 --> 32:53.919
- Teddy!

32:53.919 --> 32:55.121
- We force him to go, he'll just come

32:55.121 --> 32:56.941
on right back.
- Teddy, come home!

32:56.941 --> 32:59.354
Teddy, I love you, Teddy!

32:59.354 --> 33:00.887
Teddy, come home!

33:00.887 --> 33:01.720
- I guarantee--

33:01.720 --> 33:04.138
- No, you have to stay,
you have to get him!

33:04.138 --> 33:06.661
- Give it just a few days.
- No, please!

33:06.661 --> 33:08.050
- He'll be running down your driveway

33:08.050 --> 33:09.080
in just a few days now.
- Please, please.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.670
- You just get on down now.
- Please.

33:10.670 --> 33:13.379
- You know kids, now come on.

33:13.379 --> 33:16.129
- Teddy, Teddy, I love you, baby!

33:17.415 --> 33:20.082
I love you, come home, Teddy!

33:20.082 --> 33:23.999
(melancholic orchestral music)

33:27.847 --> 33:29.495
Teddy!

33:29.495 --> 33:31.099
Teddy!

33:31.099 --> 33:33.516
(motor hums)

33:34.860 --> 33:38.777
(melancholic orchestral music)

33:45.279 --> 33:47.862
(somber music)

34:31.043 --> 34:33.960

34:53.762 --> 34:56.344
(dimes jangle)

35:01.221 --> 35:03.905
(birds chirp)

35:03.905 --> 35:06.572
(dishes scrape)

35:08.090 --> 35:10.650
- Sounds like a goddamn parade in here.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.763
Can you be any louder?

35:12.630 --> 35:14.560
- It's Thursday, we need milk.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.240
Gonna need to head into
town if we expect to be--

35:16.240 --> 35:18.743
- Don't tell me what needs
to be done around here, boy.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.980
- You want your egg fried?

35:22.980 --> 35:24.730
- Don't I always want my egg fried?

35:26.430 --> 35:27.263
- Yes, sir.

35:40.276 --> 35:42.693
(motor hums)

35:51.601 --> 35:54.101
(lid scrapes)

35:56.859 --> 35:59.276
(motor hums)

36:03.289 --> 36:04.636
- [Buck] What the hell
you doin' in here, boy?

36:04.636 --> 36:07.120
- Nothin', just thinkin'.

36:07.120 --> 36:08.230
- You stealing from me?

36:08.230 --> 36:09.423
- No, sir.

36:10.371 --> 36:12.290
Willy must have found that years ago.

36:12.290 --> 36:14.041
- Don't you ever mention my boy!

36:14.041 --> 36:16.433
Huh, you understand that?

36:16.433 --> 36:18.553
He would have been one hell of a man

36:18.553 --> 36:21.021
had you not killed him.

36:21.021 --> 36:23.688
I'll teach you to steal from me.

36:25.220 --> 36:30.220
(belt whips)
(Teddy groans)

36:32.724 --> 36:37.724
(fist smashes)

36:49.964 --> 36:52.547
(fist smashes)

36:53.729 --> 36:56.312
(knee smashes)

36:57.463 --> 36:58.972
Willy!

36:58.972 --> 37:00.560
Willy, help me!

37:00.560 --> 37:01.993
- Don't you call on Willy.

37:03.270 --> 37:04.883
You never cared about him.

37:05.760 --> 37:06.883
We did all the work.

37:10.110 --> 37:13.480
When Willy died, I took his place,

37:13.480 --> 37:18.157
but this ends tonight you
will never hurt me again,

37:18.157 --> 37:20.363
and you will never
threaten my family again.

37:23.877 --> 37:26.377
(tense music)

37:30.863 --> 37:33.446

38:04.426 --> 38:07.176

(Teddy grunts)

38:51.597 --> 38:56.597
(flames crackle)
(suspenseful music)

39:02.003 --> 39:04.753
(flames crackle)

39:09.701 --> 39:12.701
(suspenseful music)

39:36.467 --> 39:39.269
(dramatic music)

39:39.269 --> 39:42.269

40:10.973 --> 40:13.390
(shoes thud)

40:22.740 --> 40:24.290
Mama!

40:24.290 --> 40:25.290
Girls, anybody home?

40:28.800 --> 40:29.643
Hello?

40:31.040 --> 40:31.891
Mama?

40:31.891 --> 40:34.308
(shoes thud)

40:38.400 --> 40:39.520
Mama?

40:39.520 --> 40:40.843
Girls, come on, anybody?

40:41.935 --> 40:42.768
Hello?

40:45.643 --> 40:49.829
Mama?
(shoes thud)

40:49.829 --> 40:50.662
Girls.

40:52.775 --> 40:55.442
(Teddy panting)

40:56.969 --> 40:59.386
(head thuds)

41:01.402 --> 41:04.152

41:57.732 --> 42:00.482
(water splashes)

42:04.670 --> 42:05.737
Thank you, Willy.

42:10.524 --> 42:12.744
(glass shatters)

42:12.744 --> 42:15.013
(majestic music)

42:15.013 --> 42:17.263
(cars hum)

42:19.959 --> 42:22.709
(people chatter)

42:25.634 --> 42:28.384
(majestic music)

42:33.139 --> 42:35.556
(shoes thud)

42:43.760 --> 42:45.110
- What are your plans for the day?

42:45.110 --> 42:47.926
- Well, we were supposed to
have a picnic, but the rain.

42:47.926 --> 42:50.080
- (laughs) Isn't that always the way?

42:50.080 --> 42:51.490
- Always.

42:51.490 --> 42:53.573
- Okay, that'll be five cents please.

42:54.865 --> 42:56.350
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

42:56.350 --> 42:57.510
Here you are.
- Have a good day.

42:57.510 --> 42:58.446
- You too.

42:58.446 --> 43:01.196
(register rings)

43:02.070 --> 43:02.903
Can I help you?

43:03.990 --> 43:05.180
- Me?

43:05.180 --> 43:07.270
- I'm not looking at
anybody else, now am I?

43:07.270 --> 43:08.103
- No, Ma'am.

43:09.710 --> 43:13.020
- How much for an apple
and two jerky sticks?

43:13.020 --> 43:15.440
- That'll set you back about four cents.

43:15.440 --> 43:16.780
- And a hard boiled egg.

43:16.780 --> 43:18.512
- Another two cents.

43:18.512 --> 43:19.512
- All right.

43:25.590 --> 43:28.113
- That'll be 6 cents there, big spender.

43:31.690 --> 43:32.523
You all right?

43:37.420 --> 43:38.940
- Oh my goodness.

43:38.940 --> 43:40.420
I don't need all this!

43:40.420 --> 43:42.230
Unless you'll be needing half the store!

43:42.230 --> 43:43.063
- No, Ma'am.

43:44.096 --> 43:46.423
I think that'll be all.

43:47.848 --> 43:50.150
(register dings)

43:50.150 --> 43:51.400
- You forgot your change.

44:00.608 --> 44:02.985
(door creaks)

44:02.985 --> 44:05.402
(door thuds)

44:08.640 --> 44:11.390

44:19.148 --> 44:24.148

(tires squeak)

44:26.497 --> 44:29.748
(footsteps patter)

44:29.748 --> 44:31.748
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

44:31.748 --> 44:35.233
Pardon me, pardon me.

44:35.233 --> 44:37.489
(man groans)

44:37.489 --> 44:38.489
Here you go.

44:39.984 --> 44:42.901
(footsteps patter)

44:45.197 --> 44:48.356
Hey, Willy!
- Can I help you?

44:48.356 --> 44:50.106
- Um, I'm sorry, sir.

44:51.910 --> 44:54.200
You know where public records are?

44:54.200 --> 44:55.033
- That way.

44:59.470 --> 45:00.303
- Thank you.

45:02.413 --> 45:07.253
(footsteps patter)
(women chatter softly)

45:07.253 --> 45:09.746
Oh, oh my gosh, I am so sorry.

45:09.746 --> 45:13.250
- Oh no, they were all
separated by jurisdiction.

45:13.250 --> 45:14.170
- I'll gladly help.

45:14.170 --> 45:15.670
- It's all right, I can do it.

45:17.631 --> 45:19.050
- [Man] (groans) Sarah.

45:19.050 --> 45:20.943
- I can resort them.

45:20.943 --> 45:22.920
- It's my fault, sir.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.250
- [Man] Are you from around here?

45:25.250 --> 45:26.083
- No, sir.

45:27.110 --> 45:27.943
Just looking for somebody.

45:27.943 --> 45:30.130
- Who you looking for?

45:30.130 --> 45:31.580
- Clara Rogers.

45:31.580 --> 45:34.063
Maybe you got records or
a forwarding statement?

45:34.913 --> 45:36.710
- Clara Rogers.

45:36.710 --> 45:39.780
You mean Old Widow Rogers up on the Ridge?

45:39.780 --> 45:40.613
- Yes, sir.

45:40.613 --> 45:41.730
I believe that's her.

45:41.730 --> 45:43.970
- There's no forwarding address for her.

45:43.970 --> 45:45.820
You might want to check the cemetery.

45:47.110 --> 45:48.010
- Beg your pardon?

45:49.380 --> 45:54.170
- After her husband died, her
boy, he killed another boy.

45:54.170 --> 45:56.060
And then he ran off.

45:56.060 --> 45:58.047
And then she got scarlet fever real bad,

45:58.047 --> 46:00.273
and the state came and took her girls.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.840
Why are you asking?

46:03.840 --> 46:06.420
- I'm mostly interested in her place.

46:06.420 --> 46:08.810
- Well, in that case I'd try the bank.

46:08.810 --> 46:11.060
They'd have the records
and lien information.

46:12.248 --> 46:13.648
(hand taps)
Good luck, son.

46:14.887 --> 46:17.804
(footsteps patter)

46:18.662 --> 46:20.656
It's a good farm.

46:20.656 --> 46:22.323
Somebody oughta be living in it.

46:24.745 --> 46:27.662
(footsteps patter)

46:30.938 --> 46:32.150
(dramatic music)
(footsteps thud)

46:32.150 --> 46:34.264
- Whoa, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, easy now.

46:34.264 --> 46:35.507
- I need to get help.

46:35.507 --> 46:36.497
- What's wrong, is that blood?

46:36.497 --> 46:37.750
Are you okay?

46:37.750 --> 46:39.520
- We snuck into the mill
when everyone left for lunch

46:39.520 --> 46:41.030
and Paul, he's trapped inside the gears.

46:41.030 --> 46:42.882
He's bleeding pretty bad.

46:42.882 --> 46:43.890
We're in so much trouble.

46:43.890 --> 46:45.132
- Just tell me, where is he?

46:45.132 --> 46:46.980
- Downstairs of the Wells grain mill.

46:46.980 --> 46:48.650
In the grinding room.

46:48.650 --> 46:49.483
- Okay.

46:50.674 --> 46:53.674
(suspenseful music)

46:55.720 --> 46:57.808
- I need a big stick, like
a garden rake or something.

46:57.808 --> 46:59.163
- Oh, um.

47:01.554 --> 47:04.394
(footsteps thud)

47:04.394 --> 47:07.144
(dramatic music)

47:12.468 --> 47:13.301
- Gosh

47:16.045 --> 47:17.886
(footsteps thud)

47:17.886 --> 47:20.469
(Teddy grunts)

47:21.458 --> 47:22.908
- [Elizabeth] Here, try this.

47:26.047 --> 47:26.880
(Teddy grunts)

47:26.880 --> 47:29.745
- You gotta come over here.
- Okay.

47:29.745 --> 47:30.755
Okay, okay, okay.

47:30.755 --> 47:31.960
- Okay, come on, grab him, grab him.

47:31.960 --> 47:32.793
Okay, ready, pull.

47:32.793 --> 47:34.325
- Okay.
- Pull, now!

47:34.325 --> 47:37.711
(Teddy grunts)

47:37.711 --> 47:39.145
(Elizabeth grunts)

47:39.145 --> 47:41.658
- [Elizabeth] Oh my God, oh my God.

47:41.658 --> 47:45.992
(dramatic music)
(footsteps thud)

47:45.992 --> 47:47.620
- Hey, he needs a doctor, quickly.

47:47.620 --> 47:49.970
- [Man] Uh, I can take
him, follow me, come on!

47:51.030 --> 47:52.016
- Careful, careful.

47:52.016 --> 47:55.320
(Teddy grunts)

47:55.320 --> 47:56.153
- Guys, come on.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.258
Doc, Doc, there's been an accident.

48:04.258 --> 48:06.570
It's Mr. Wells's nephew, sir, it's Paul.

48:06.570 --> 48:08.453
- Dear God, put him on the table.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.590
- Greta has the day off today.

48:14.590 --> 48:16.626
I'm gonna need one of you
boys to stay and help.

48:16.626 --> 48:17.534
(Doc groans)

48:17.534 --> 48:18.713
That's not gonna work.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.590
Can you tell me how long
he's been unconscious?

48:26.980 --> 48:28.283
Son, you with me here?

48:31.166 --> 48:34.083
(footsteps patter)

48:36.766 --> 48:39.364
(doorbell chimes)

48:39.364 --> 48:41.340
- What the hell happened to you?

48:41.340 --> 48:43.230
- Passed out from the blood, sir.

48:43.230 --> 48:44.063
It's mighty bad.

48:44.063 --> 48:45.330
- Why don't you head back to the mill.

48:45.330 --> 48:46.867
We got a pretty big mess to clean up.

48:46.867 --> 48:49.700
(doorbell chimes)

48:52.394 --> 48:55.210
- What in the Sam Hills
all the ringing in here.

48:55.210 --> 48:57.170
Oh, Clarence.

48:57.170 --> 48:58.708
Suppose you're here to
check on your nephew.

48:58.708 --> 49:00.790
- How is he, Doc, I
heard it was pretty bad.

49:00.790 --> 49:03.323
- You heard right, but he's gonna make it.

49:04.290 --> 49:09.290
The leg, I'm not so sure,
but we did our best.

49:09.870 --> 49:11.590
If it wasn't for your employee back there

49:11.590 --> 49:13.560
helping with the boy,

49:13.560 --> 49:15.810
your nephew might be talking to St. Peter.

49:15.810 --> 49:17.830
- You mean Howard, who just left?

49:17.830 --> 49:20.160
- No, the young man in back.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.540
He stayed and helped me stabilize him.

49:22.540 --> 49:24.560
Couldn't have done it by myself.

49:24.560 --> 49:26.160
Sheriff is bringing an
ambulance to get him

49:26.160 --> 49:27.360
over to Charlottesville.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.700
- If you won't be
needing me any more, sir,

49:32.700 --> 49:34.470
I think I'm gonna head out.

49:34.470 --> 49:35.340
- What's your name, son?

49:35.340 --> 49:36.173
- Ted.

49:36.173 --> 49:37.780
Uh, Theodore, sir.

49:37.780 --> 49:38.920
Theodore Rogers.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.990
- Hell of a job, Mr. Rogers.

49:40.990 --> 49:42.600
That boy owes you his life.

49:42.600 --> 49:43.600
- Glad I could help.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.153
- Hey, hey, son!

49:49.153 --> 49:50.841
Hey, stop there!
- Sir?

49:50.841 --> 49:53.320
- I'm Mr. Wells, I'm
the owner of that mill.

49:53.320 --> 49:55.101
So you're the fella that
carried Paul from the mill here?

49:55.101 --> 49:57.390
- (stammers) Yes, sir.

49:57.390 --> 49:59.083
- I need to shake your hand.

49:59.083 --> 50:00.590
You saved that boy's life.

50:00.590 --> 50:02.470
- I just carried him.

50:02.470 --> 50:05.143
- Don't be humble, you
did an amazing thing.

50:05.143 --> 50:06.450
You looking for a job?

50:06.450 --> 50:07.915
- Oh yes, yes, sir.

50:07.915 --> 50:09.887
- Be at the mill at dawn tomorrow.

50:09.887 --> 50:11.970
I'll have a job waiting for you.

50:11.970 --> 50:13.342
How's $8 a week sound?

50:13.342 --> 50:15.640
- That's fine, I'll be there.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.850
- Starting tomorrow, you can
use one of our delivery trucks

50:17.850 --> 50:20.210
to go to and from and to get your own.

50:20.210 --> 50:23.330
All right, get on out of
here and change them clothes.

50:23.330 --> 50:24.480
You're a fearful sight!

50:27.026 --> 50:29.443
(shoes thud)

50:30.730 --> 50:33.820
Gentlemen, you remember Theodore Rogers.

50:33.820 --> 50:35.470
He's gonna be delivering with us.

50:36.500 --> 50:38.620
Let me show you how we do this.

50:38.620 --> 50:40.550
Now on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

50:40.550 --> 50:42.309
you come over here and
you see how many bags

50:42.309 --> 50:44.950
go to Charlottesville, how
many bags go to Jacksonville.

50:44.950 --> 50:48.660
Now, each driver's responsible
for their own vehicle.

50:48.660 --> 50:51.220
You fill it, deliver it and get
it back here by supper time.

50:51.220 --> 50:54.035
The rest of the days, you just
spend here filling the bags

50:54.035 --> 50:57.350
and grinding the corn
into mash, sound good?

50:57.350 --> 50:58.183
- I can do this.

50:58.183 --> 50:59.153
Thank you for the opportunity.

51:00.853 --> 51:05.215
- Oh, and Theodore,
next time you play hero,

51:05.215 --> 51:07.481
try to spare me some equipment.

51:07.481 --> 51:09.467
(Teddy chuckles)

51:09.467 --> 51:12.634
(mill machinery hums)

51:17.953 --> 51:20.370
(motor hums)

51:21.350 --> 51:26.267
(bags thud)
(Teddy grunts)

51:28.476 --> 51:31.226
(car door slams)

51:35.218 --> 51:37.968
(handle rattles)

51:40.437 --> 51:42.887
(Elizabeth chuckles)

51:42.887 --> 51:45.804
(footsteps patter)

51:52.221 --> 51:53.971
- You all right there, big spender?

51:55.479 --> 51:57.005
- Yeah, yeah.

51:57.005 --> 51:59.260
I'm just used to cranking
it a little differently.

51:59.260 --> 52:00.150
- Oh yeah, sure.

52:00.150 --> 52:01.750
Those cranks can be real tricky.

52:03.970 --> 52:06.380
You have no idea what
you're doing, do you?

52:06.380 --> 52:07.339
- It's been a while.

52:07.339 --> 52:08.539
- (laughs) All right so.

52:13.403 --> 52:16.350
(groans) Just start your engine.

52:16.350 --> 52:18.531
You're gonna want to press
on that lever to your right

52:18.531 --> 52:21.010
and turn your key.

52:21.010 --> 52:22.700
That's your coil buck switch.

52:22.700 --> 52:23.880
Good job.
- Okay.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.958
- Now, you need to make
sure your car is in neutral,

52:25.958 --> 52:27.960
which is this lever in the center.

52:27.960 --> 52:29.770
- Okay, right here?
- Mm-hmm.

52:29.770 --> 52:32.530
Now, you have two pedals on your left,

52:32.530 --> 52:35.200
which are your clutch and your brake.

52:35.200 --> 52:37.764
And then this pedal on the
right is your accelerator,

52:37.764 --> 52:40.210
which is going to advance the car.

52:40.210 --> 52:43.955
So, first we clutch and then you gas.

52:43.955 --> 52:45.870
(tires rumble)

52:45.870 --> 52:46.950
Good job.

52:46.950 --> 52:48.790
Now actually, if you turn right up here,

52:48.790 --> 52:50.440
I know a really good
place for you to practice

52:50.440 --> 52:51.993
before you head out for delivery.

52:52.968 --> 52:57.968
(tires rumble)
(motor hums)

52:59.820 --> 53:01.400
Good job.

53:01.400 --> 53:02.470
Good job!

53:02.470 --> 53:04.820
Now, you need to make
sure that it's in neutral

53:04.820 --> 53:07.828
before you try and start it again.

53:07.828 --> 53:10.410
(laughs) You'll get it.

53:10.410 --> 53:13.214
Not too bad for your first driving lesson.

53:13.214 --> 53:16.520
- Second, it's my second time.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.270
- Well, you're a very good cranker.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.710
So, are you going to drive me back to town

53:25.710 --> 53:26.986
or do I need to walk home?

53:26.986 --> 53:29.194
- Sorry, I'll take you home.

53:29.194 --> 53:32.277
(engine revs softly)

53:33.198 --> 53:35.653
- (laughs) I'm glad you
remembered the lever.

53:38.302 --> 53:43.219
(motor hums)
(birds chirp)

53:50.200 --> 53:52.617
(motor hums)

53:56.739 --> 53:59.156
(door thuds)

54:02.384 --> 54:03.801
- Can I help you?

54:04.800 --> 54:06.630
- Yes, I have a delivery.

54:06.630 --> 54:08.160
Cornmeal from Wells Feed and Grain.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.823
- Ah, you must be our new driver.

54:11.515 --> 54:12.653
- It's you!

54:13.600 --> 54:15.233
You're a real hero.

54:16.947 --> 54:20.123
Good news spreads like
wildfire around these parts.

54:21.530 --> 54:23.093
- 10 bags, that sound right?

54:24.900 --> 54:26.260
- Yes, Ma'am.

54:26.260 --> 54:28.002
- You can put 'em in
the back with the rest.

54:28.002 --> 54:30.400
Melanie will show you where.

54:30.400 --> 54:31.250
- Right this way.

54:35.350 --> 54:36.183
- [Woman] Go on girls.

54:36.183 --> 54:37.723
- Candy!
- Candy!

54:37.723 --> 54:40.483
- Girls, no running, be respectful.

54:40.483 --> 54:41.750
(girls chatter)

54:41.750 --> 54:44.310
- One piece each, girls, just one.

54:44.310 --> 54:45.486
- [Woman] You both excited?

54:45.486 --> 54:48.798
- Yes.
- Yes, all right.

54:48.798 --> 54:50.290
There you go.

54:50.290 --> 54:51.920
You're picking out the two very best ones.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.177
- [Girl] Mine is bigger than yours.

54:53.177 --> 54:55.830
- Let me show you what
we got in the other day.

54:55.830 --> 54:56.663
Come over here.

54:57.703 --> 54:59.825
Look at these little twin dolls.

54:59.825 --> 55:01.620
Don't they look just like you?

55:01.620 --> 55:02.855
Look at their twin dresses.

55:02.855 --> 55:03.922
- This one looks like me.

55:03.922 --> 55:06.462
- This one looks like me.

55:06.462 --> 55:09.067
(gentle music)

55:09.067 --> 55:10.597
- What about this one over here?

55:10.597 --> 55:12.791
(people chatter softly)

55:12.791 --> 55:15.958
Nice to see you, stay out of the heat.

55:17.040 --> 55:20.070
- That family that was just in here.

55:20.070 --> 55:22.274
- Reverend McCall, them little girls?

55:22.274 --> 55:24.136
- Yeah.

55:24.136 --> 55:26.000
Have they always lived here?

55:26.000 --> 55:26.833
- Sure.

55:27.774 --> 55:29.683
Except them little girls.

55:30.906 --> 55:34.090
Their Mama got real sick and
she couldn't take care of them.

55:34.090 --> 55:36.189
And the Reverend and
his wife weren't blessed

55:36.189 --> 55:38.993
with any children so they stepped in.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.831
What part of the country are you from?

55:41.831 --> 55:42.749
- Ma'am.

55:42.749 --> 55:47.450
- You from Maysville or you
here in Charlotte, Jackson?

55:47.450 --> 55:49.540
- Oh, neither really.

55:49.540 --> 55:50.913
I'm just from up the Ridge.

55:52.130 --> 55:55.450
- You're awful young
to be out on your own.

55:55.450 --> 55:56.753
- I'm almost 18, Ma'am.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.953
Thank you, have a good day.

56:12.372 --> 56:13.970
(distant thudding)

56:13.970 --> 56:15.073
- Is that you, Daddy?

56:16.860 --> 56:17.929
- Elizabeth.

56:17.929 --> 56:19.183
- Hi, Daddy.

56:21.537 --> 56:22.750
(lips smack)

56:22.750 --> 56:24.590
What brings you into town this afternoon?

56:24.590 --> 56:25.742
- Oh, thank you, darling.

56:25.742 --> 56:26.742
- Of course.

56:33.860 --> 56:36.690
- I heard you got in the car
with some young man yesterday

56:36.690 --> 56:37.770
and headed outta town.

56:37.770 --> 56:39.083
- You spying on me, Daddy?

56:40.080 --> 56:43.810
- Spying is such a harsh word.

56:43.810 --> 56:46.750
- He's not a stranger, he's a hero.

56:46.750 --> 56:47.661
Did you hear about that man

56:47.661 --> 56:49.673
who saved Paul Wells at the mill?

56:50.670 --> 56:52.823
So you can see he's not all that scary.

56:55.160 --> 56:59.940
- I heard you helped
in that rescue as well.

56:59.940 --> 57:01.083
That's my girl.

57:02.440 --> 57:03.790
What do you know about him?

57:06.230 --> 57:08.133
That's what makes him a stranger.

57:11.130 --> 57:13.013
- Hi, can I help you?

57:16.210 --> 57:18.050
- Y'all got anything to drink around here?

57:18.050 --> 57:19.752
- I can pour you a glass of sweet tea.

57:19.752 --> 57:21.480
- (scoffs) That's not exactly what I'm

57:21.480 --> 57:23.730
in the market for, young lady.

57:23.730 --> 57:26.270
- There's a little thing
called prohibition, sir.

57:26.270 --> 57:27.329
We don't break the law here.

57:27.329 --> 57:29.090
- Well then I guess I'll
just take some sugar

57:29.090 --> 57:30.073
and corn mash then.

57:32.615 --> 57:33.950
- I can get you the sugar,

57:33.950 --> 57:36.100
but the mash is gonna be over at the mill.

57:36.100 --> 57:37.600
- Well, that's about ignorant.

57:38.830 --> 57:40.677
- I believe your time here is done.

57:40.677 --> 57:42.040
- Who the hell are you?

57:42.040 --> 57:43.749
- You got no business here.

57:43.749 --> 57:46.610
- That's a hell of a
way to treat a patron.

57:46.610 --> 57:48.003
Show me some respect.

57:49.700 --> 57:51.794
I could teach you a
thing or two, young lady.

57:51.794 --> 57:54.860
(chuckles) Oh.

57:54.860 --> 57:55.693
- Daddy!

57:55.693 --> 57:58.683
- All right, looks like
somebody struck a nerve.

57:58.683 --> 58:01.100
(motor hums)

58:17.829 --> 58:20.746
(footsteps patter)

58:21.600 --> 58:23.140
- Hey, big spender.

58:23.140 --> 58:24.350
- Howdy, Ma'am.

58:24.350 --> 58:27.080
- Howdy Ma'am, that's all you got to say?

58:27.080 --> 58:28.070
- Ma'am?

58:28.070 --> 58:30.290
- You are quite the talk
about town, you know.

58:30.290 --> 58:32.162
A real life hero.

58:32.162 --> 58:34.480
Oh, and humble too.

58:34.480 --> 58:35.519
- All in a day's work.

58:35.519 --> 58:36.763
- I spoke too soon.

58:38.860 --> 58:40.880
- I better get going, Mr.
Wells is expecting me.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.660
- Oh, but we don't want
to keep the mayor waiting.

58:42.660 --> 58:43.862
- Mr. Wells is the mayor?

58:43.862 --> 58:45.293
- Where are you from hero?

58:46.350 --> 58:47.552
- Around.

58:47.552 --> 58:49.573
- Oh, I like a mystery.

58:50.480 --> 58:52.480
What's the name a hero goes by nowadays?

58:56.350 --> 58:57.450
- Theodore.

58:57.450 --> 58:59.270
My name is Theodore Rogers.

58:59.270 --> 59:00.840
- Well, Theodore Rogers,

59:00.840 --> 59:03.841
you and I made a pretty
good team the other day.

59:03.841 --> 59:05.991
Maybe we can work
together again some time.

59:07.031 --> 59:08.787
Welcome to Maysville.

59:10.000 --> 59:10.833
- Say,

59:13.100 --> 59:15.900
what does a clerk from the
general store go by nowadays?

59:16.780 --> 59:19.488
- I'm gonna make you work for that one.

59:19.488 --> 59:22.405
(footsteps patter)

59:34.550 --> 59:37.763
- Mr. Wells, sir, I have your invoice.

59:37.763 --> 59:41.500
- Well, I hope you have a
little bit more than an invoice.

59:41.500 --> 59:43.490
Like about 110 more things.

59:43.490 --> 59:44.323
- Yes, sir.

59:47.690 --> 59:48.680
- I must admit I wasn't expecting

59:48.680 --> 59:50.500
to be carrying money like that.

59:50.500 --> 59:52.468
- You got nothing to worry about.

59:52.468 --> 59:54.172
(chuckles) If you have any trouble,

59:54.172 --> 59:56.868
use that Colt .45 under your seat.

59:56.868 --> 59:58.330
Ain't nobody gonna bother you

59:58.330 --> 59:59.993
with that peacemaker in your lap.

1:00:01.710 --> 1:00:02.637
- Night boss.

1:00:02.637 --> 1:00:03.737
- See you later, boss.

1:00:05.430 --> 1:00:08.340
- Good night, boys,
see you in the morning!

1:00:08.340 --> 1:00:09.670
- Say, you hungry?

1:00:09.670 --> 1:00:11.092
- [Teddy] Yes, I could use a bite.

1:00:11.092 --> 1:00:13.442
- Excellent, let's you
and me grab some supper.

1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:16.787
Have you eaten at that
restaurant in town yet?

1:00:16.787 --> 1:00:20.240
- No, sir, but I must admit
I'm kind of short right now.

1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:21.540
Maybe another time?

1:00:21.540 --> 1:00:23.310
- Oh nonsense, my treat.

1:00:23.310 --> 1:00:24.671
I'll tell you, Della
makes the best biscuits

1:00:24.671 --> 1:00:27.103
and fried apples this
side of the Mississippi.

1:00:29.265 --> 1:00:33.280
(guests chatter softly)

1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:34.772
- [Della] Well, here you go, gentlemen.

1:00:34.772 --> 1:00:36.410
Excuse me.

1:00:36.410 --> 1:00:39.010
Will you be having any iced
tea with that or coffee?

1:00:39.900 --> 1:00:41.210
- Coffee?

1:00:41.210 --> 1:00:42.819
Thanks, Della.

1:00:42.819 --> 1:00:45.680
You know, son, for you to
drive the truck back here today

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:47.190
with all that money in your pocket

1:00:47.190 --> 1:00:48.840
shows a lot about your character.

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:52.310
I ain't never let nobody
but family deliver for me.

1:00:53.823 --> 1:00:56.600
Of course, I never had a son of my own,

1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:00.760
but if I did, I'd hope he'd
have character like you.

1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:01.840
Integrity.

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:02.690
- Thank you, sir.

1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:07.013
- Two coffees.

1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:09.610
Enjoy your dinner.

1:01:09.610 --> 1:01:10.443
- Thanks, Della.

1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:14.843
I'll tell you, them taters
have just the right crunch.

1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:16.853
- They look delicious.

1:01:20.260 --> 1:01:25.260
Say, Mr. Wells, can I ask you a question?

1:01:25.310 --> 1:01:27.439
- [Mr. Wells] Well, sure,
son, what do you need to know?

1:01:27.439 --> 1:01:32.399
- Well, there's this young
girl over at the general store.

1:01:32.399 --> 1:01:35.142
- Oh, Mr. Smallwood's daughter.

1:01:35.142 --> 1:01:37.700
- Smallwood, like the
berry farm Smallwood?

1:01:37.700 --> 1:01:41.249
- Berry farm, general store, horse farm.

1:01:41.249 --> 1:01:42.920
Good family.

1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:44.470
- What's her first name?

1:01:44.470 --> 1:01:45.810
- Elizabeth.

1:01:45.810 --> 1:01:47.200
She's the only daughter.

1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:48.243
Has three sons too.

1:01:52.620 --> 1:01:55.483
- Elizabeth Smallwood. (chuckles)

1:01:57.884 --> 1:02:00.634
(utensils clang)

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:07.810
Looks like it might rain later.

1:02:07.810 --> 1:02:08.643
Thank you for dinner.

1:02:08.643 --> 1:02:09.973
- My pleasure.

1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:15.431
Theodore, I think I'm
gonna give you an advance

1:02:15.431 --> 1:02:17.995
on this week's salary.

1:02:17.995 --> 1:02:19.580
You never know when you might need to buy

1:02:19.580 --> 1:02:20.730
something at the store.

1:02:21.770 --> 1:02:24.280
- Why are you being so
kind to me, Mr. Wells?

1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:26.083
- I like you, you impressed me.

1:02:28.170 --> 1:02:29.170
Have a good evening.

1:02:35.824 --> 1:02:38.324
(shoes clack)

1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:48.130
- We gotta stop meeting like this.

1:02:48.130 --> 1:02:50.884
- Well, hello there,
Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood.

1:02:50.884 --> 1:02:54.140
- Gee, detective, that
sure didn't take long.

1:02:54.140 --> 1:02:56.375
You must've been working
real hard to get my name.

1:02:56.375 --> 1:02:57.940
- Maybe.

1:02:57.940 --> 1:02:59.380
- [Elizabeth] How was your
ride to Charlottesville?

1:02:59.380 --> 1:03:00.700
- Ah, it wasn't too bad.

1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:02.292
- I'm glad.

1:03:02.292 --> 1:03:05.170
(rain pours)

1:03:05.170 --> 1:03:06.730
Do you want another driving lesson?

1:03:06.730 --> 1:03:08.543
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

1:03:13.858 --> 1:03:17.040
(car door thuds)

1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:18.913
So, where do you want to go?

1:03:19.860 --> 1:03:22.250
- Now, where is the
romance in asking a woman

1:03:22.250 --> 1:03:23.363
where she wants to go?

1:03:24.282 --> 1:03:26.567
Take me somewhere I've never been.

1:03:29.484 --> 1:03:32.234
(crickets chirp)

1:03:34.390 --> 1:03:36.410
You did good, Mr. Rogers.

1:03:36.410 --> 1:03:37.393
This is quite nice.

1:03:38.768 --> 1:03:41.723
- I used to play here as a
child with my best friend.

1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:44.410
- I bet you fished and threw rocks

1:03:44.410 --> 1:03:46.054
and caused all sorts of trouble.

1:03:46.054 --> 1:03:48.004
- (chuckles) Yeah, something like that.

1:03:48.869 --> 1:03:51.473
You know, I baptized him
right there in that spot.

1:03:52.970 --> 1:03:54.820
- You were a strange kid, Mr. Rogers.

1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:58.160
What do you like to do now?

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.680
Besides baptisms and lifesaving?

1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:01.710
- What do you mean?

1:04:01.710 --> 1:04:04.467
- For fun, you a wild man?

1:04:04.467 --> 1:04:08.020
- Oh, no, nothing really.

1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:09.560
- Nothin'?

1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:10.860
Everybody likes something.

1:04:11.965 --> 1:04:13.320
- I like to draw.

1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:14.730
- Michelangelo, aye?

1:04:14.730 --> 1:04:16.245
- Michael, who?

1:04:16.245 --> 1:04:18.400
- Theodore Rogers, you don't
know who Michelangelo is?

1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:20.622
- No, Ma'am, I'm not familiar
with any of the Angelo family.

1:04:20.622 --> 1:04:23.453
- (laughs) He painted the Sistine Chapel.

1:04:25.150 --> 1:04:26.473
The Creation of Adam?

1:04:28.150 --> 1:04:29.663
The Statue of David?

1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:33.410
We're gonna need to work on this.

1:04:35.310 --> 1:04:36.360
Where are your folks?

1:04:38.997 --> 1:04:40.163
- They're passed.

1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:42.293
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:04:44.050 --> 1:04:44.900
Your best friend?

1:04:49.530 --> 1:04:52.323
My, Mr. Rogers, you sure
hold some serious heartache.

1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:54.833
Is your world always this sad?

1:04:56.154 --> 1:04:59.273
- Up until now, I reckon so.

1:05:01.270 --> 1:05:03.470
- Well, I guess we'll
need to fix that then.

1:05:06.828 --> 1:05:08.883
- What are you doing?

1:05:10.087 --> 1:05:11.411
(zipper clatters)

1:05:11.411 --> 1:05:13.035
Okay.

1:05:13.035 --> 1:05:14.480
Yeah.

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:16.613
And there's the dress, right.

1:05:16.613 --> 1:05:19.142
(Elizabeth giggles)

1:05:19.142 --> 1:05:20.242
(water splashes)

1:05:20.242 --> 1:05:21.909
- Oh, it's freezing!

1:05:23.629 --> 1:05:25.126
- You'll catch your death.
- I'm fine.

1:05:25.126 --> 1:05:26.776
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine!

1:05:28.729 --> 1:05:29.810
(Elizabeth giggles)

1:05:29.810 --> 1:05:31.930
Baptize me, Theodore Rogers!

1:05:31.930 --> 1:05:34.492
Wash me of my sins of what I have done

1:05:34.492 --> 1:05:36.643
and what I am about to do!

1:05:38.730 --> 1:05:40.180
- You are crazy.

1:05:40.180 --> 1:05:41.580
- Made you smile, didn't it?

1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:46.383
No more heartache, Mr. Rogers.

1:05:54.088 --> 1:05:56.505
(shoes thud)

1:06:05.826 --> 1:06:08.576
(water splashes)

1:06:13.966 --> 1:06:15.973
- You sure you want to do this?

1:06:15.973 --> 1:06:17.473
- Save my soul, Theodore.

1:06:18.707 --> 1:06:21.457
(water splashes)

1:06:28.283 --> 1:06:30.700
(lips smack)

1:06:35.157 --> 1:06:36.563
I saw the light.

1:06:37.777 --> 1:06:40.290
- And we keep ending up in water.

1:06:40.290 --> 1:06:41.340
- It must be destiny.

1:06:44.576 --> 1:06:46.990
(dramatic music)

1:06:46.990 --> 1:06:47.823
- Theo.

1:06:51.917 --> 1:06:53.489
- I need to go.

1:06:53.489 --> 1:06:55.332
I should get you home.

1:06:55.332 --> 1:06:58.082
(water splashes)

1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:09.460
- You'll need to take a right
at the fork in the road.

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.770
- Is this a horse farm?

1:07:11.770 --> 1:07:14.000
- Yes, but don't go down the drive.

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.280
Just drop me off at the driveway.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.040
- What kind of gentleman would I be

1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:18.900
if I didn't walk you to your front door?

1:07:18.900 --> 1:07:19.773
- A live one.

1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:22.333
- All right.

1:07:28.180 --> 1:07:29.530
- What happened back there?

1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:33.273
Are we just gonna pretend we
weren't having a good time?

1:07:35.780 --> 1:07:37.430
- It's hard to explain.

1:07:37.430 --> 1:07:38.394
- I got time.

1:07:38.394 --> 1:07:40.510
(bell chiming)

1:07:40.510 --> 1:07:42.350
- Maybe not.

1:07:42.350 --> 1:07:45.333
- You are saved by the
bell, Theodore Rogers.

1:07:48.593 --> 1:07:49.830
(car door thuds)

1:07:49.830 --> 1:07:50.733
And another thing,

1:07:51.610 --> 1:07:54.380
Theodore doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.

1:07:54.380 --> 1:07:56.313
I'm gonna call you Theo or Teddy.

1:07:57.239 --> 1:07:58.873
- My mother called me Teddy.

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:01.780
- Theo it is.

1:08:01.780 --> 1:08:03.140
Sleep well, Theo.

1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:04.549
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:08:04.549 --> 1:08:07.299
(crickets chirp)

1:08:10.456 --> 1:08:12.956
(head thumps)

1:08:20.719 --> 1:08:21.670
- It's pretty late.

1:08:23.250 --> 1:08:24.122
- Damn it, Daddy.

1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:26.830
Not spying on me again?

1:08:26.830 --> 1:08:29.740
- [Mr. Smallwood] Watch your
language, you're still a lady.

1:08:29.740 --> 1:08:31.100
At least I hope so.

1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:33.719
- What is that supposed
to mean, "hope so"?

1:08:33.719 --> 1:08:35.219
- It's not proper for a young woman

1:08:35.219 --> 1:08:37.800
to be gallivanting around
the whole damn country.

1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:39.303
- [Elizabeth] Watch your language.

1:08:40.448 --> 1:08:43.490
(door creaks)

1:08:43.490 --> 1:08:46.655
- With some boy in the
late hours of the night.

1:08:46.655 --> 1:08:48.255
And don't you get saucy with me.

1:08:49.477 --> 1:08:51.360
Why are you wet?

1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:54.210
- Well, Daddy, you have
nothing to worry about.

1:08:54.210 --> 1:08:59.210
He was a complete gentleman,
despite my overtures.

1:08:59.350 --> 1:09:02.290
So, you can sleep well tonight

1:09:02.290 --> 1:09:06.987
knowing that your young, innocent
daughter is still a lady.

1:09:09.068 --> 1:09:10.268
Good night.

1:09:10.268 --> 1:09:13.184
(footsteps patter)

1:09:20.048 --> 1:09:22.465
(motor hums)

1:09:32.737 --> 1:09:35.487
(car door thuds)

1:09:54.291 --> 1:09:56.708
(door thuds)

1:10:03.809 --> 1:10:04.643
- Hello.

1:10:06.469 --> 1:10:07.303
- Theo.

1:10:10.969 --> 1:10:12.820
- I hear you have the best sweet tea.

1:10:13.782 --> 1:10:15.323
- You have good sources.

1:10:18.545 --> 1:10:21.128
(tea splashes)

1:10:29.969 --> 1:10:30.803
Well?

1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:34.300
- Mm, yup, that's delicious.

1:10:34.300 --> 1:10:35.133
Don't tell Della.

1:10:35.133 --> 1:10:38.029
(Elizabeth laughs)

1:10:39.110 --> 1:10:40.460
I'm sorry about last night.

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:45.523
I was wondering if maybe you
can give me a second chance.

1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:48.596
- What exactly were you thinking?

1:10:48.596 --> 1:10:51.112
- Oh, I have something in mind.

1:10:54.350 --> 1:10:57.623
You know, Elizabeth doesn't
exactly roll off the tongue.

1:10:59.532 --> 1:11:00.743
I'm gonna call you Beth.

1:11:01.841 --> 1:11:05.008

(Teddy gasps)

1:13:01.130 --> 1:13:03.630
(engine revs)

1:13:09.716 --> 1:13:10.553
- Mr. Wells, sir.

1:13:10.553 --> 1:13:11.930
I have your invoice and payment from

1:13:11.930 --> 1:13:14.517
Jacksonville this week.
- Oh, that's fine, Theo.

1:13:14.517 --> 1:13:17.090
And thanks for all the hard
work you're putting in.

1:13:17.090 --> 1:13:18.216
How long has it been now?

1:13:18.216 --> 1:13:19.900
- About three months, sir.

1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:21.210
- Three months.

1:13:21.210 --> 1:13:25.260
Never late, always willing to
lend a hand, strong as an ox.

1:13:25.260 --> 1:13:28.150
I tell you, you're a
true asset to this mill.

1:13:28.150 --> 1:13:29.494
- Thank you, sir.

1:13:29.494 --> 1:13:33.350
Not to be rude, but I
do have someone waiting.

1:13:33.350 --> 1:13:34.440
- Oh, I see.

1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:37.260
You got a cold refreshing
ice tea waiting for you,

1:13:37.260 --> 1:13:38.093
I presume?

1:13:39.172 --> 1:13:43.423
You know, Theo, tea is a wonderful thing.

1:13:45.090 --> 1:13:49.257
It's cool when you need
it, warm when you need it.

1:13:49.257 --> 1:13:51.737
But you can't let it sit too long.

1:13:51.737 --> 1:13:53.263
The ice melts.

1:13:54.508 --> 1:13:57.340
And the warmth wears off.

1:13:57.340 --> 1:14:00.764
And then all you got is something
that's just sitting there.

1:14:00.764 --> 1:14:03.733
If you really want to enjoy
the freshness of that tea,

1:14:04.790 --> 1:14:06.540
you gotta take the necessary steps.

1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:10.343
Now, don't be pussyfooting around.

1:14:11.730 --> 1:14:13.932
- We still talking about tea, Mr. Wells?

1:14:13.932 --> 1:14:15.683
- (laughs) You tell me.

1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:19.300
Do you know, Theodore.

1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:23.370
I've never held the hand
of a woman after church.

1:14:24.876 --> 1:14:27.576
Or carried a child to his
bed to tuck him in at night.

1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:31.969
Don't make the same mistakes I made, son.

1:14:32.871 --> 1:14:34.420
Don't let time slip away.

1:14:35.358 --> 1:14:37.941
(gentle music)

1:14:46.910 --> 1:14:48.830
- [Elizabeth] You're back a little early.

1:14:48.830 --> 1:14:51.510
- Oh, light load in Jackson.

1:14:51.510 --> 1:14:53.603
- Extra sweet, just like you.

1:14:56.490 --> 1:14:57.602
- Oh.

1:14:57.602 --> 1:14:58.700
- What?

1:14:58.700 --> 1:14:59.850
- You're wearing pants.

1:15:00.770 --> 1:15:03.070
- Yes, is that a problem?

1:15:03.070 --> 1:15:04.120
You know, I vote too.

1:15:05.030 --> 1:15:07.559
- I've just never seen a
woman wear pants before.

1:15:07.559 --> 1:15:08.900
- Well, there's a lot of things in me

1:15:08.900 --> 1:15:11.190
you haven't seen, Theo Rogers.

1:15:11.190 --> 1:15:12.820
Imagine what's in store for you.

1:15:12.820 --> 1:15:13.808
- Keep talking like that

1:15:13.808 --> 1:15:15.650
and you might have just a little kiss.

1:15:15.650 --> 1:15:16.980
- You do that in this town square

1:15:16.980 --> 1:15:19.075
and this town would lock you up so fast.

1:15:19.075 --> 1:15:20.643
- Oh, I'll take my chances.

1:15:21.730 --> 1:15:23.130
- Oh, I have a gift for you.

1:15:25.750 --> 1:15:27.800
It's a collection of Michelangelo's work.

1:15:29.230 --> 1:15:31.893
The Sistine Chapel is on page 72.

1:15:35.017 --> 1:15:36.700
- Wow, thank you.

1:15:36.700 --> 1:15:38.366
- Mm-hmm.

1:15:38.366 --> 1:15:39.616
- You know I was thinking

1:15:40.654 --> 1:15:42.469
I might take you somewhere tonight.

1:15:42.469 --> 1:15:45.130
- You taking me back for
another dip in the creek?

1:15:45.130 --> 1:15:46.290
You feeling sinful?

1:15:46.290 --> 1:15:47.623
- Oh, not quite.

1:15:48.740 --> 1:15:50.670
How about picking you up at six?

1:15:50.670 --> 1:15:51.770
Don't keep me waiting.

1:15:59.491 --> 1:16:02.241
(car door slams)

1:16:04.526 --> 1:16:07.526
(lips smack softly)

1:16:11.193 --> 1:16:14.550
- Theo, you can't be doing that in public.

1:16:14.550 --> 1:16:16.702
- Sorry, I guess I can't help myself.

1:16:18.570 --> 1:16:20.513
Sometimes you're just
more than I can handle.

1:16:21.540 --> 1:16:23.440
Say, you know that man?

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:24.940
Never seen him in town before.

1:16:26.780 --> 1:16:28.420
- He comes into the store every so often.

1:16:28.420 --> 1:16:29.767
I don't know his name.

1:16:29.767 --> 1:16:31.680
But he always smells like whiskey.

1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:33.610
I guess every town needs a town drunk.

1:16:33.610 --> 1:16:34.633
- Yeah, I guess.

1:16:35.510 --> 1:16:37.248
Thank you for the tea.

1:16:37.248 --> 1:16:38.360
You know it means a lot.

1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:41.290
I'm grateful for every
time you give me this.

1:16:41.290 --> 1:16:42.180
And the book.

1:16:42.180 --> 1:16:43.580
I can't wait to read through it.

1:16:43.580 --> 1:16:45.570
- Well, as long as you'll let me,

1:16:45.570 --> 1:16:47.219
I will always have a tea for you,

1:16:48.290 --> 1:16:52.323
but now I have to get back to the store.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.150
I will see you tonight.

1:16:56.043 --> 1:16:58.960
(footsteps patter)

1:17:06.978 --> 1:17:08.759
(door thuds)

1:17:08.759 --> 1:17:11.592
(Elizabeth sighs)

1:17:25.441 --> 1:17:30.380
- [Mr. Smallwood] That was
quite the display out there.

1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:31.530
- Whatever do you mean?

1:17:32.791 --> 1:17:36.165
- You've been seeing that
boy for some time now.

1:17:36.165 --> 1:17:38.452
- That boy has a name.

1:17:41.475 --> 1:17:44.320
- I think it's time you bring him by.

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:45.340
- Why, Daddy?

1:17:45.340 --> 1:17:47.219
So, you can tell him
that he's not good enough

1:17:47.219 --> 1:17:48.370
for your only daughter?

1:17:49.299 --> 1:17:51.782
- Now that's just not fair.

1:17:53.510 --> 1:17:55.090
- What's fair, Daddy?

1:17:55.090 --> 1:17:57.971
Are you telling me you're gonna
welcome him with open arms

1:17:57.971 --> 1:18:01.037
and say, "Welcome to the family, son."

1:18:02.571 --> 1:18:04.493
- You gotta give me a chance first.

1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:09.963
He can't be all that bad
if you care about him.

1:18:11.730 --> 1:18:14.430
- Now, Daddy, don't you go
be an all supportive on me.

1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:17.710
- I'll give him a chance, Elizabeth.

1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:20.500
- That's all I can ask for, Daddy.

1:18:22.464 --> 1:18:23.297
Your move.

1:18:24.894 --> 1:18:28.897
(pieces thud)
(Elizabeth laughs)

1:18:28.897 --> 1:18:31.480
(bright music)

1:18:41.632 --> 1:18:44.382
(car door thuds)

1:18:52.630 --> 1:18:54.324
Where are we, Theo?

1:18:54.324 --> 1:18:55.448
(car door thuds)

1:18:55.448 --> 1:18:59.693
- (sighs) This is my home, I grew up here.

1:19:01.130 --> 1:19:02.183
- It's beautiful.

1:19:07.964 --> 1:19:10.547
(bright music)

1:19:18.259 --> 1:19:21.175
(Elizabeth laughs)

1:19:22.044 --> 1:19:27.044
(gasps) Theo, this is wonderful.

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:32.219
Oh.

1:19:32.219 --> 1:19:35.487
Well, thank you.

1:19:35.487 --> 1:19:37.335
You have green beans!

1:19:37.335 --> 1:19:38.373
- Yes, I do.

1:19:40.460 --> 1:19:41.446
- Did you make those?

1:19:41.446 --> 1:19:42.279
- I did.

1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:45.020
- They look incredible.

1:19:45.020 --> 1:19:46.447
- And...

1:19:46.447 --> 1:19:47.950
- Did you get those from Della?

1:19:47.950 --> 1:19:49.830
- No, all me.

1:19:49.830 --> 1:19:51.180
- Well, color me impressed.

1:19:55.270 --> 1:19:56.410
- Well, I hope you're hungry.

1:19:56.410 --> 1:19:57.320
Should still be warm.

1:19:57.320 --> 1:19:58.940
- It looks perfect.

1:19:58.940 --> 1:20:00.210
- You haven't even tasted it yet.

1:20:00.210 --> 1:20:01.777
- I don't need to.

1:20:01.777 --> 1:20:04.233
And you have such a lovely home.

1:20:05.650 --> 1:20:07.400
- I tried to clean it a bit.

1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:09.251
It has sat its spell.

1:20:09.251 --> 1:20:11.683
- (laughs) It could use a woman's touch.

1:20:12.532 --> 1:20:13.833
- I agree.

1:20:19.559 --> 1:20:21.380
- Dinner was lovely.

1:20:21.380 --> 1:20:23.530
Where'd you learn to cook like that?

1:20:23.530 --> 1:20:25.475
- I used to cook for a
man I worked for once.

1:20:25.475 --> 1:20:26.880
- Oh.

1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:31.880
Well, I would let you cook for me anytime,

1:20:32.700 --> 1:20:35.000
but don't break my egg
yolks, whatever you do.

1:20:37.530 --> 1:20:38.719
(tense music)

1:20:38.719 --> 1:20:42.219
(Teddy clears his throat)

1:20:45.518 --> 1:20:46.351
Theo?

1:20:48.621 --> 1:20:49.454
Theo.

1:20:53.691 --> 1:20:56.273
(gentle music)

1:20:57.555 --> 1:21:01.388
Do you mind telling me
what happened in there?

1:21:04.780 --> 1:21:06.180
Theo, you're doing it again.

1:21:08.050 --> 1:21:09.612
You're pushing me away.

1:21:09.612 --> 1:21:11.817
What the hell is going on?

1:21:11.817 --> 1:21:13.583
- He was not a good man.

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.483
He was evil, he was horrible.

1:21:19.580 --> 1:21:21.603
- Who are you talking about, Theo?

1:21:25.263 --> 1:21:27.059
- The man in town today.

1:21:27.059 --> 1:21:29.038
- [Elizabeth] What man?

1:21:29.038 --> 1:21:30.733
- The drunk.

1:21:30.733 --> 1:21:31.566
He, uh...

1:21:31.566 --> 1:21:33.612
- Theo, it's okay, I'm right here.

1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:40.680
- [Teddy] No, I'm just being stupid.

1:21:41.850 --> 1:21:42.683
- Theo.

1:21:44.642 --> 1:21:47.413
If you do not let me in,

1:21:47.413 --> 1:21:49.813
if you don't let me close to you.

1:21:52.059 --> 1:21:55.063
Please, you have to let me help you.

1:22:04.900 --> 1:22:06.223
- He hurt me as a kid.

1:22:09.570 --> 1:22:12.782
He hurt me when I worked at his farm.

1:22:15.047 --> 1:22:16.152
He...

1:22:16.152 --> 1:22:17.152
- It's okay.

1:22:18.088 --> 1:22:20.143
It's okay, I'm so sorry.

1:22:22.037 --> 1:22:24.577
Theo I love you.

1:22:26.094 --> 1:22:28.677
(bright music)

1:22:32.666 --> 1:22:35.084
(lips smack)

1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:43.300
(lips smack)
(bright music)

1:23:16.396 --> 1:23:17.386
- You're the most beautiful woman

1:23:17.386 --> 1:23:20.553
in the world, Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood.

1:23:23.487 --> 1:23:25.154
I need to stop here.

1:23:31.978 --> 1:23:33.996
Some things are just worth waiting for.

1:23:45.825 --> 1:23:48.407
(tires rumble)

1:23:56.496 --> 1:23:58.898
(car door thuds)

1:23:58.898 --> 1:24:01.815
(distant thudding)

1:24:16.021 --> 1:24:18.688
(safety clicks)

1:24:40.715 --> 1:24:43.132
(shoes thud)

1:24:47.797 --> 1:24:49.047
Can I help you?

1:24:51.837 --> 1:24:53.587
- It's alright, you can put away your gun.

1:24:58.100 --> 1:25:00.123
- Ma'am, do I know you?

1:25:01.250 --> 1:25:02.083
- I know you.

1:25:03.139 --> 1:25:05.219
- You're from Charlottesville?

1:25:05.219 --> 1:25:06.053
The Emporium.

1:25:08.170 --> 1:25:09.620
- I guess you could say that.

1:25:11.580 --> 1:25:12.787
Teddy.

1:25:12.787 --> 1:25:15.320
(gentle music)

1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:16.719
- My family called me Teddy.

1:25:17.639 --> 1:25:18.473
- That's right.

1:25:20.684 --> 1:25:22.153
Do you remember me?

1:25:25.130 --> 1:25:26.333
Look closer.

1:25:32.719 --> 1:25:35.887
It's all right, it's been a long time,

1:25:37.607 --> 1:25:39.307
and I know a child's memory fades.

1:25:45.414 --> 1:25:47.331
- My, how you've grown.

1:25:55.389 --> 1:25:56.222
- Mama?

1:25:59.590 --> 1:26:02.416
So, how long have you known?

1:26:04.493 --> 1:26:06.260
- About a month?

1:26:06.260 --> 1:26:08.577
Mr. Wells confirmed it for me.

1:26:08.577 --> 1:26:12.520
He told me about your
mother and your sisters.

1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:16.032
But when he told me about
your father and the railroad,

1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:19.440
that's what I knew it was you.

1:26:21.300 --> 1:26:23.600
- And you chose to stay away from me?

1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:27.340
- I chose to do what you wanted.

1:26:28.790 --> 1:26:30.717
Four and a half years ago you told me

1:26:30.717 --> 1:26:35.510
that you didn't want me, that
you wanted to stay with him.

1:26:35.510 --> 1:26:37.639
- Mom, I was protecting you.

1:26:37.639 --> 1:26:39.353
Couldn't you tell?

1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:43.170
- You told everyone I was dead.

1:26:43.170 --> 1:26:44.620
- I was told you passed away,

1:26:45.690 --> 1:26:47.750
and the girls were adopted out.

1:26:47.750 --> 1:26:50.700
And then I went to
Charlottesville and I saw them.

1:26:50.700 --> 1:26:52.173
It all made sense.

1:26:56.010 --> 1:26:58.723
Wait, do you know about the girls?

1:26:59.900 --> 1:27:03.563
- I know them, but they don't know me.

1:27:04.972 --> 1:27:07.090
The pastor and his wife
bringing them around

1:27:07.090 --> 1:27:08.793
once a month for me to see them.

1:27:10.700 --> 1:27:12.100
They're very well cared for.

1:27:14.870 --> 1:27:15.833
- It really is you.

1:27:19.860 --> 1:27:21.360
- So, you don't hate me?

1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:22.960
- No, Mama.

1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:25.053
When I escaped I came looking for you.

1:27:38.610 --> 1:27:40.840
- Did he hurt you?

1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:42.957
- You don't wanna know that, Mama.

1:27:42.957 --> 1:27:46.290
I'm alive, I'm here, we have each other.

1:27:50.895 --> 1:27:54.228
(Clara whimpers softly)

1:27:57.540 --> 1:27:59.423
- You've done very well with yourself.

1:28:00.490 --> 1:28:01.527
You know, Mr. Wells,

1:28:01.527 --> 1:28:04.749
he told me all about
that boy that you saved.

1:28:04.749 --> 1:28:08.063
And some other things too.

1:28:08.930 --> 1:28:10.003
- Other things?

1:28:12.043 --> 1:28:13.773
- He told me about her.

1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:16.730
- Elizabeth.

1:28:16.730 --> 1:28:17.563
- I've seen her.

1:28:18.559 --> 1:28:19.610
She's very beautiful.

1:28:24.263 --> 1:28:25.903
Do you love her?

1:28:25.903 --> 1:28:28.178
- I do.

1:28:28.178 --> 1:28:29.844
- When you're ready,

1:28:39.068 --> 1:28:41.596
I want you to give her this.

1:28:41.596 --> 1:28:44.773
- No, Mama, this is the ring from daddy.

1:28:44.773 --> 1:28:47.980
- I'd rather give it to
somebody who is in love

1:28:47.980 --> 1:28:52.980
than keep it as a reminder
of the love that I have lost.

1:28:53.236 --> 1:28:54.236
- Thank you.

1:28:55.293 --> 1:28:58.900
When the time is right,
I will let you know.

1:29:05.293 --> 1:29:07.920
I guess I better get going.

1:29:07.920 --> 1:29:09.120
Lot of explaining to do.

1:29:10.312 --> 1:29:11.733
A lot to talk to Beth about.

1:29:17.517 --> 1:29:20.100
(floor creaks)

1:29:22.723 --> 1:29:24.520
Can you stay?

1:29:24.520 --> 1:29:25.452
Please, come home.

1:29:27.050 --> 1:29:28.150
- You want me to stay?

1:29:29.139 --> 1:29:30.743
- I'll figure this out.

1:29:30.743 --> 1:29:31.743
You're safe.

1:29:41.507 --> 1:29:43.820
This is the best day of my life.

1:29:43.820 --> 1:29:44.713
I'm finally home.

1:29:49.907 --> 1:29:52.324
(shoes thud)

1:29:57.559 --> 1:29:58.960
- Theo!

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:00.313
Thank God.

1:30:00.313 --> 1:30:02.850
You have never been this late.

1:30:02.850 --> 1:30:05.350
We really need to get a phone
installed in that house.

1:30:05.350 --> 1:30:06.760
I was worried sick.

1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:08.389
- Listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

1:30:08.389 --> 1:30:09.639
- There you are.

1:30:09.639 --> 1:30:12.066
You know, I was just bragging
on you for your punctuality.

1:30:12.066 --> 1:30:14.261
- Mr. Wells, look, I'm sorry.

1:30:14.261 --> 1:30:15.563
- Well, hell!

1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:18.188
Is that what I think it is?

1:30:18.188 --> 1:30:21.088
- Theo, you said you needed
to talk to me about something?

1:30:25.296 --> 1:30:27.620
- This isn't exactly how I planned this.

1:30:27.620 --> 1:30:29.309
- Never is, son.

1:30:29.309 --> 1:30:31.440
Come on, what are you waiting for?

1:30:31.440 --> 1:30:33.023
The tea is getting cold.

1:30:36.170 --> 1:30:41.170
- Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood,
would you do me the honor?

1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:43.280
- Yes, Theodore Rogers.

1:30:43.280 --> 1:30:44.761
I accept your offer of marriage.

1:30:44.761 --> 1:30:45.733
- Woo, hot damn!

1:30:45.733 --> 1:30:47.719
This is a cause for celebration.

1:30:47.719 --> 1:30:49.550
What do you say we gather
all the folks tonight

1:30:49.550 --> 1:30:51.452
in the Lewis and Clark ballroom.

1:30:51.452 --> 1:30:53.743
I'll get Della to whip up a feast.

1:30:53.743 --> 1:30:55.530
We'll have music and dancing

1:30:55.530 --> 1:30:58.120
and celebrate your announcement in style!

1:30:58.120 --> 1:30:59.059
- Tonight, sir?

1:30:59.059 --> 1:31:00.500
- No time like the present.

1:31:00.500 --> 1:31:01.610
- Thank you, sir.

1:31:01.610 --> 1:31:03.162
I'm sure Pa would love to help as well.

1:31:03.162 --> 1:31:06.000
- Now, don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:07.330
Now, go on, get gussied up.

1:31:07.330 --> 1:31:08.200
We'll see you tonight.

1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:09.410
- Yes, sir.

1:31:09.410 --> 1:31:10.243
I love you.

1:31:12.151 --> 1:31:14.568
(lips smack)

1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:17.870
- That is one happy lady.

1:31:17.870 --> 1:31:19.600
You did good, son.

1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:20.450
- Thank you, sir.

1:31:21.340 --> 1:31:22.740
- Now, come on, we gotta
get you cleaned up too.

1:31:22.740 --> 1:31:24.136
We got a party to plan.

1:31:24.136 --> 1:31:27.710
(vibrant fiddle music)

1:31:27.710 --> 1:31:32.710
(guests clap)
(guests cheer)

1:31:43.264 --> 1:31:45.373
You're getting a fine
young man for a son-in-law.

1:31:45.373 --> 1:31:47.540
- I don't know, Clarence.

1:31:47.540 --> 1:31:48.949
Sure don't know much about him.

1:31:48.949 --> 1:31:50.410
- What more is there to know?

1:31:50.410 --> 1:31:52.309
He's a hero, he's a damn good worker,

1:31:52.309 --> 1:31:54.240
and he's head over
heels for your daughter.

1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:55.073
He'll be good to her.

1:31:55.073 --> 1:31:57.570
- You don't know anything
about his family?

1:31:57.570 --> 1:31:58.879
What he comes from?

1:31:58.879 --> 1:32:02.030
They could be a family of
convicts for all we know.

1:32:02.030 --> 1:32:04.620
- I assure you that
young man has character.

1:32:04.620 --> 1:32:06.330
There's not an evil bone in his body.

1:32:06.330 --> 1:32:07.473
I'll vouch for him.

1:32:07.473 --> 1:32:09.232
- Is that right?

1:32:09.232 --> 1:32:12.960
- Closest thing to a son I'll ever have.

1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:15.580
(vibrant fiddle music)

1:32:15.580 --> 1:32:20.580
(guests clap)
(guests cheer)

1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:31.957
- Thank y'all so much,
I sure appreciate it.

1:32:31.957 --> 1:32:33.514
We're gonna take a short break.

1:32:33.514 --> 1:32:35.780
Y'all can come on up and grab some grub,

1:32:35.780 --> 1:32:39.392
and don't forget to
congratulate the happy couple.

1:32:39.392 --> 1:32:41.975
(guests cheer)

1:32:52.494 --> 1:32:54.911
(door thuds)

1:32:59.389 --> 1:33:00.823
- You look beautiful.

1:33:00.823 --> 1:33:03.576
- Thank you, it was my mother's.

1:33:03.576 --> 1:33:06.200
(spoon taps)

1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:09.164
- Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight is a great night!

1:33:09.164 --> 1:33:13.430
We're all united in support
of this fine young couple.

1:33:13.430 --> 1:33:16.180
(crickets chirp)

1:33:19.612 --> 1:33:22.029
(shoes thud)

1:33:23.850 --> 1:33:24.683
- Evening.

1:33:25.889 --> 1:33:27.853
Where are you going all gussied up?

1:33:29.269 --> 1:33:31.171
- We were just celebrating Mr. Smallwood's

1:33:31.171 --> 1:33:32.621
daughter's engagement.

1:33:32.621 --> 1:33:36.583
- And you decided to stand
out here on the streets alone?

1:33:38.010 --> 1:33:39.260
You looking for somebody?

1:33:42.290 --> 1:33:44.280
- I'm gonna have to ask
you to leave her alone.

1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:46.243
I'll be the one taking her home tonight.

1:33:47.096 --> 1:33:49.532
If you're looking for
the party, it's inside,

1:33:49.532 --> 1:33:52.040
but you're gonna have to leave her alone.

1:33:52.040 --> 1:33:53.844
- Engagement party, huh?

1:33:53.844 --> 1:33:55.469
Who's the lucky fellow who's gonna

1:33:55.469 --> 1:33:57.309
roll into all that money?

1:33:57.309 --> 1:33:59.950
- He's not from here,
you wouldn't know him.

1:33:59.950 --> 1:34:00.782
None of us do.

1:34:02.118 --> 1:34:04.433
His name is Theodore Rogers.

1:34:08.100 --> 1:34:10.700
- Theodore Rogers, you're
like the son I never had.

1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:11.900
And for an engagement gift,

1:34:11.900 --> 1:34:15.750
I'm offering you a permanent
position at the mill.

1:34:15.750 --> 1:34:18.760
Son, I'm offering you a foreman job.

1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:20.036
Will you accept?

1:34:20.036 --> 1:34:21.606
- Yes, sir, thank you, sir.

1:34:21.606 --> 1:34:22.870
- All right.

1:34:22.870 --> 1:34:27.279
(guests applaud)
- Thank you, thank you.

1:34:27.279 --> 1:34:30.279
(hands clap slowly)

1:34:33.070 --> 1:34:34.073
- Hip hip hooray.

1:34:35.389 --> 1:34:37.860
Let's all give it up for the happy couple.

1:34:37.860 --> 1:34:39.487
- Who in the hell are you?

1:34:39.487 --> 1:34:41.043
- You're supposed to be dead.

1:34:42.900 --> 1:34:45.019
- Mister, I don't know your
name or where you're from,

1:34:45.019 --> 1:34:47.760
but we don't want any trouble around here.

1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:49.719
So, why don't you get the hell outta here?

1:34:49.719 --> 1:34:51.053
- You don't know my name.

1:34:52.410 --> 1:34:53.693
You don't know my name.

1:34:54.693 --> 1:34:57.870
Well, why don't you just
ask the groom to be here?

1:34:57.870 --> 1:34:59.070
Ain't that right, Teddy?

1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:01.513
- What's he talking about?

1:35:02.730 --> 1:35:03.563
Theo?

1:35:03.563 --> 1:35:04.563
- Theo?

1:35:05.644 --> 1:35:09.553
(laughs) Who the hell is Theo?

1:35:10.513 --> 1:35:13.963
Oh, he's got you all fooled.

1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:16.883
You don't even know who you're marrying.

1:35:16.883 --> 1:35:18.913
(laughs) Don't that beat all.

1:35:19.809 --> 1:35:23.323
Lady, you're standing next to a murderer.

1:35:24.460 --> 1:35:25.920
Go ahead.

1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:28.987
Ask him, ask him if
he's ever killed anyone.

1:35:28.987 --> 1:35:30.969
- What's he saying?

1:35:30.969 --> 1:35:31.803
Is it true?

1:35:35.254 --> 1:35:36.393
- I can explain.

1:35:37.436 --> 1:35:38.719
It was an accident.

1:35:38.719 --> 1:35:40.139
- You lied to me.

1:35:40.139 --> 1:35:40.973
- I would--
- How could you?

1:35:40.973 --> 1:35:42.350
- I would never lie to you.

1:35:42.350 --> 1:35:43.553
(shoes thud)

1:35:43.553 --> 1:35:44.386
Mr. Wells, I swear to you.

1:35:44.386 --> 1:35:46.160
I was just a child, okay?

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:48.350
I was playing.

1:35:48.350 --> 1:35:51.123
- Son, I'm the least of
your worries, now go.

1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:53.693
- That's right.

1:35:54.550 --> 1:35:55.782
You run, you coward!

1:35:56.770 --> 1:35:59.219
You run just like you did
when you killed my boy!

1:36:01.530 --> 1:36:05.580
My Willy was drug all across that farm,

1:36:05.580 --> 1:36:08.443
cut all to pieces and dismembered.

1:36:10.210 --> 1:36:11.043
From your hands!

1:36:13.450 --> 1:36:14.282
- Mister.

1:36:15.309 --> 1:36:16.143
- It's not true.

1:36:22.614 --> 1:36:24.809
- Beth, please, stop.

1:36:24.809 --> 1:36:25.643
Let me explain.

1:36:25.643 --> 1:36:27.230
- Explain what?

1:36:27.230 --> 1:36:30.290
That your name is really Teddy,
that you murdered someone?

1:36:30.290 --> 1:36:32.110
- I told you, my mother called me Teddy.

1:36:32.110 --> 1:36:33.710
- Oh, thank you for that.

1:36:33.710 --> 1:36:34.543
You just left out the part

1:36:34.543 --> 1:36:36.624
about killing another human being.

1:36:36.624 --> 1:36:40.240
Damn it, Theo, I told my
father you were a good person.

1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:41.630
I am so ashamed.

1:36:41.630 --> 1:36:42.960
- Will you just listen to me?

1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:45.070
- How could you embarrass me like that?

1:36:45.070 --> 1:36:47.410
How would you embarrass my entire family?

1:36:47.410 --> 1:36:48.620
I could never marry a liar,

1:36:48.620 --> 1:36:50.410
let alone someone who
killed another person.

1:36:50.410 --> 1:36:52.719
- Damn it, will you just let me explain?

1:36:52.719 --> 1:36:53.553
- I can't.

1:36:54.630 --> 1:36:56.930
- If you've ever loved
me for even a second,

1:36:56.930 --> 1:36:57.990
you will let me explain.

1:36:57.990 --> 1:36:59.713
I will tell you everything.

1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:14.383
- Where are you taking me?

1:37:19.690 --> 1:37:20.840
- Little Willy Stamper.

1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:23.570
You're Buck Stamper, right?

1:37:23.570 --> 1:37:26.680
- Who wants to know?
- My Pa was there.

1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:29.143
He's the one who found Willy,
you can ask the sheriff.

1:37:30.630 --> 1:37:31.463
- See?

1:37:33.700 --> 1:37:34.969
Now you all know

1:37:37.035 --> 1:37:38.763
that boy killed my son.

1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:43.590
- It seems you and I
remember this differently.

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:45.509
They were two kids doing something

1:37:45.509 --> 1:37:47.190
they shouldn't have been doing, yes.

1:37:47.190 --> 1:37:49.112
It was an accident.

1:37:50.536 --> 1:37:54.159
That's why no charges were
ever leveled against that boy.

1:37:54.159 --> 1:37:57.130
They were playing with
your gun, Mr. Stamper,

1:37:57.130 --> 1:37:58.730
before they got on that tractor.

1:37:59.670 --> 1:38:00.830
If you'd been a better father,

1:38:00.830 --> 1:38:02.330
your son would be alive today.

1:38:03.750 --> 1:38:06.660
That boy, he ran to get help.

1:38:07.799 --> 1:38:10.233
He tried to get his Mama to save Willy.

1:38:11.370 --> 1:38:12.719
He never left him to die alone.

1:38:12.719 --> 1:38:17.323
He left him to save his
life, and that's the truth.

1:38:20.166 --> 1:38:22.750
(somber music)

1:38:25.030 --> 1:38:27.157
- You're not welcome here.

1:38:27.157 --> 1:38:30.487
Now get the hell out of
Maysville before we run you out.

1:38:41.046 --> 1:38:43.463
(shoes thud)

1:38:48.110 --> 1:38:50.527
(motor hums)

1:38:52.289 --> 1:38:54.956
(tires screech)

1:39:06.282 --> 1:39:09.032
(car door slams)

1:39:12.910 --> 1:39:17.077
- Elizabeth, when I was a child, 13,

1:39:19.410 --> 1:39:21.180
I was with my best friend, Willy.

1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:23.713
We were playing bandits
with his daddy's gun.

1:39:25.570 --> 1:39:28.910
Beth, the bullets ran out.

1:39:28.910 --> 1:39:30.389
We went to your grandpa's farm.

1:39:30.389 --> 1:39:32.090
- To steal his tractor, I know the story.

1:39:32.090 --> 1:39:32.923
- No.

1:39:32.923 --> 1:39:36.213
Because we wanted to be grownups
and drive the damn thing.

1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.323
That's when things went terribly wrong.

1:39:42.730 --> 1:39:46.343
Willy fell, and I couldn't make it stop.

1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:52.850
- Who the hell are you?

1:39:54.559 --> 1:39:56.664
- Everything he's saying is true.

1:39:56.664 --> 1:39:58.313
- What is going on here?

1:40:01.050 --> 1:40:05.263
- Beth, this is my mother.

1:40:06.530 --> 1:40:09.202
- Oh, great.

1:40:10.250 --> 1:40:11.425
More lies.

1:40:11.425 --> 1:40:12.960
What's next, Theo?

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:16.420
Is your dead father going to
walk out of the chicken coop?

1:40:16.420 --> 1:40:17.960
What is wrong with you people?

1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:20.490
How long have you been
planning this charade?

1:40:20.490 --> 1:40:24.650
And you have been coming to
the store for over a month now!

1:40:24.650 --> 1:40:26.530
And the whole time you
were just fooling me

1:40:26.530 --> 1:40:30.900
into being some part of
your big master scheme!

1:40:30.900 --> 1:40:32.683
My God, I'm such a fool!

1:40:33.537 --> 1:40:36.190
- No, it's not like that.

1:40:36.190 --> 1:40:38.752
Okay, I just escaped a few months ago.

1:40:38.752 --> 1:40:40.170
- [Elizabeth] From who, your mother?

1:40:40.170 --> 1:40:42.083
- No, from the devil himself.

1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:45.889
That man in town today,
he was Willy's father.

1:40:45.889 --> 1:40:47.889
And when he died, I had to take his place

1:40:47.889 --> 1:40:50.163
or he was gonna kill me
and my entire family.

1:40:52.510 --> 1:40:56.580
I survived for four years with pure evil.

1:40:56.580 --> 1:41:00.410
Being yelled at, beaten,
tormented every day of my life.

1:41:00.410 --> 1:41:03.043
And he threatened to hurt
my family if I ever left.

1:41:05.394 --> 1:41:06.693
And then a few months ago,

1:41:08.290 --> 1:41:12.413
I went looking for the girls
and Mama, but they were gone.

1:41:14.207 --> 1:41:16.003
And I went into town and I met you.

1:41:19.356 --> 1:41:20.483
And I still see him.

1:41:22.740 --> 1:41:24.217
Willy stills haunts me.

1:41:26.780 --> 1:41:31.240
But he's my best friend, and
I never wanted him to die.

1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:32.073
Never.

1:41:33.132 --> 1:41:34.910
- Is this true?

1:41:34.910 --> 1:41:37.493
(solemn music)

1:42:19.728 --> 1:42:21.896
You did this to save them?

1:42:33.843 --> 1:42:36.260
(motor hums)

1:42:43.070 --> 1:42:44.543
- Well, ain't that sweet.

1:42:45.889 --> 1:42:48.910
Got ourselves a real family reunion here.

1:42:48.910 --> 1:42:50.510
You showing her your scars, boy?

1:42:51.398 --> 1:42:52.713
I did you a favor.

1:42:53.620 --> 1:42:56.389
You spare the rod, you spoil the child.

1:42:56.389 --> 1:42:57.637
I made a man outta you.

1:43:00.364 --> 1:43:01.380
You look different.

1:43:01.380 --> 1:43:02.280
- Leave her alone.

1:43:03.892 --> 1:43:05.633
- I can still see you clearly.

1:43:06.570 --> 1:43:08.820
- Seems our little
agreement didn't suit you.

1:43:09.861 --> 1:43:12.639
You left, not before
causing me to lose my barn.

1:43:12.639 --> 1:43:14.090
- You tried to kill me.

1:43:14.090 --> 1:43:15.013
- Deal's off.

1:43:16.987 --> 1:43:18.383
Back to square one.

1:43:19.550 --> 1:43:20.830
- So this is never gonna end?

1:43:20.830 --> 1:43:22.020
- This is my family now,

1:43:22.020 --> 1:43:23.050
and you are messing with the wrong--

1:43:23.050 --> 1:43:25.240
- You better mind your little lady.

1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:27.293
You don't want her getting hurt.

1:43:27.293 --> 1:43:29.893
You're not gonna hurt her or anybody.

1:43:30.770 --> 1:43:33.250
I've paid any debt I had to you.

1:43:33.250 --> 1:43:34.452
I owe you nothing.

1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:37.123
- That's not the deal.

1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:41.200
An eye for an eye, a life for a life.

1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:43.250
- Your reign of terror ends here, Mister.

1:43:43.250 --> 1:43:44.460
Do you have any idea who I am?

1:43:44.460 --> 1:43:45.530
I could have my daddy on you--

1:43:45.530 --> 1:43:48.520
- Your Daddy can't help
you right here right now.

1:43:48.520 --> 1:43:49.820
This gets settled tonight.

1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:54.960
- Then take me.

1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:55.923
- No, Mama.

1:43:58.011 --> 1:43:59.833
- If you have me, I'll go with you.

1:44:00.780 --> 1:44:01.973
I'll take his place.

1:44:04.527 --> 1:44:06.277
- Well, ain't that a twist of fate.

1:44:07.483 --> 1:44:08.880
Your Mama done saved you boy.

1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:10.762
- I'll kill you.
- Teddy!

1:44:10.762 --> 1:44:12.550
I love you and I can never repay you

1:44:12.550 --> 1:44:14.020
for what you did for me and the girls.

1:44:14.020 --> 1:44:16.620
But right now I need you to
put her in that car and go!

1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:17.452
Go!

1:44:18.730 --> 1:44:20.600
- [Buck] You best listen
to your Mama, boy.

1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:22.210
- I love you, I'll be back for you.

1:44:22.210 --> 1:44:23.043
- [Clara] Go!

1:44:23.043 --> 1:44:25.503
- Stay strong, I'll have my
Daddy get you before sunrise!

1:44:33.270 --> 1:44:34.469
- It's might chilly out.

1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:37.550
Would you mind if I got my shawl?

1:44:37.550 --> 1:44:40.003
It would make the ride more comfortable.

1:44:45.025 --> 1:44:47.608
(solemn music)

1:44:50.969 --> 1:44:54.150
- Kind of ironic, don't you think?

1:44:54.150 --> 1:44:55.807
I ended up with you after all.

1:44:58.431 --> 1:45:01.014
(solemn music)

1:45:14.719 --> 1:45:17.137
(motor hums)

1:45:20.750 --> 1:45:22.127
- We need to get straight to the sheriff.

1:45:22.127 --> 1:45:24.306
- No, he won't help, I
just need to get you safe.

1:45:24.306 --> 1:45:26.889
(gunshot pops)

1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:33.240
Did you hear that?

1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:34.702
- Gunshot.

1:45:34.702 --> 1:45:36.339
Go.

1:45:36.339 --> 1:45:39.339
(suspenseful music)

1:45:55.443 --> 1:45:57.117
(Elizabeth gasps)

1:45:57.117 --> 1:46:00.019
(Clara cries)

1:46:00.019 --> 1:46:01.000
- Hey, Mama, hey.

1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:01.833
You all right?

1:46:01.833 --> 1:46:03.853
- I don't know, I don't know!

1:46:03.853 --> 1:46:06.273
We were arguing and he was...

1:46:06.273 --> 1:46:11.273
I went to get my shawl. (cries)

1:46:13.610 --> 1:46:15.277
Theo, what do we do?

1:46:22.438 --> 1:46:24.188
What do we do, Teddy?

1:46:27.893 --> 1:46:30.226
- We get you somewhere safe.

1:46:33.088 --> 1:46:34.862
(gentle music)

1:46:34.862 --> 1:46:38.133
Elizabeth, you take her to safety.

1:46:38.133 --> 1:46:38.966
- Okay.

1:46:42.350 --> 1:46:43.853
Theo, are you coming with us?

1:46:50.910 --> 1:46:52.389
Theo, are you coming with us?

1:46:52.389 --> 1:46:55.260
- No, I've gotta stay with the body.

1:46:55.260 --> 1:46:57.309
Send the sheriff, I'll take it from here.

1:46:58.748 --> 1:47:01.055
It's all over now.

1:47:01.055 --> 1:47:03.638
(solemn music)

1:47:10.930 --> 1:47:11.763
Go.

1:47:12.646 --> 1:47:15.146
(engine revs)

1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:22.452
There are secrets in the mountains,

1:47:23.503 --> 1:47:26.032
and sometimes secrets are covered by lies.

1:47:27.180 --> 1:47:29.480
I know my Mama killed
Buck Stamper that night,

1:47:30.454 --> 1:47:33.139
a secret I hold to this day.

1:47:33.139 --> 1:47:35.250
But it wasn't until years later

1:47:35.250 --> 1:47:36.740
she finally told me the truth.

1:47:36.740 --> 1:47:39.623
(Clara groans)

1:47:39.623 --> 1:47:42.138
- You got this, okay.

1:47:42.138 --> 1:47:44.496
(Clara groans)

1:47:44.496 --> 1:47:45.968
I can see the head.

1:47:45.968 --> 1:47:48.718
(Clara whimpers)

1:47:53.271 --> 1:47:54.493
(baby coos)

1:47:54.493 --> 1:47:55.410
It's a boy.

1:47:56.980 --> 1:47:57.813
William.

1:47:58.971 --> 1:47:59.804
Little William.

1:48:04.766 --> 1:48:06.407
He can't stay here.

1:48:06.407 --> 1:48:08.639
- [Teddy] The truth was always there.

1:48:08.639 --> 1:48:10.010
- John will now.

1:48:10.010 --> 1:48:13.320
- [Teddy] I guess we just
choose to see what we wanna see.

1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:15.219
- Think it might be all that drinkin'.

1:48:16.503 --> 1:48:20.473
First the war, then Mama left him.

1:48:22.260 --> 1:48:23.643
You lucky you don't have a daddy.

1:48:24.799 --> 1:48:27.299
(tense music)

1:48:28.318 --> 1:48:30.902
(solemn music)

1:48:32.520 --> 1:48:34.653
- [Young Teddy] She lost
her husband and her baby.

1:48:34.653 --> 1:48:36.760
Maybe we can cut her some slack.

1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:38.639
- I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you boys.

1:48:38.639 --> 1:48:41.133
You know this can get infected.

1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:45.507
- [Buck] Look at him, look at him!

1:48:47.731 --> 1:48:49.573
- My Teddy loved him too.

1:48:51.620 --> 1:48:52.793
I loved him.

1:48:54.100 --> 1:48:56.603
You aren't the only one mourning here.

1:48:56.603 --> 1:48:58.173
- You didn't love Willy.

1:48:59.752 --> 1:49:01.788
He was mine.

1:49:01.788 --> 1:49:04.371
(solemn music)

1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:16.389
You gonna tell him or should I?

1:49:17.225 --> 1:49:18.525
He killed his own brother.

1:49:20.231 --> 1:49:23.172
(gunshot blasts)

1:49:23.172 --> 1:49:25.672
(birds chirp)

1:49:27.704 --> 1:49:30.287
(solemn music)
