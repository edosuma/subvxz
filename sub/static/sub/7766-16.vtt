WEBVTT

00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:17.999
- Lisa Vanderpump sangria
is an amazing product.

00:17.999 --> 00:19.999
- I have always planned
on getting back into the wine

00:19.999 --> 00:20.999
and spirits business
at some point.

00:20.999 --> 00:22.000
- I'm happy that Schwartz

00:22.999 --> 00:23.999
is making a commitment
to something.

00:23.999 --> 00:26.999
- We didn't realize
what a big undertaking it is

00:26.999 --> 00:28.999
and what a time
commitment it would be.

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
- We turn around,
there's two cops.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
- Jax has to get arrested.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
- I'm definitely suspending you,

00:34.999 --> 00:37.999
and we really need to have
a serious conversation

00:37.999 --> 00:39.999
about your future.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.999
- Stassi wants to
talk to you.

00:41.999 --> 00:42.999
- No.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
- Our engagement
party's coming up,

00:44.999 --> 00:46.999
and I would love
for you to come.

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
- I'm hoping
to actually talk to her

00:48.999 --> 00:49.999
at some point before then.

00:49.999 --> 00:53.999
- Oh, yeah, you're dreaming.
That's not gonna happen.

00:57.999 --> 01:00.999
- ♪ You know
that it's our time ♪

01:00.999 --> 01:02.999
♪ These are the best days ♪

01:02.999 --> 01:05.999
♪ Of our lives ♪

01:05.999 --> 01:09.999
♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:09.999 --> 01:14.999
♪ This one's
for you tonight ♪

01:14.999 --> 01:18.999
- ♪ We were meant
to be magical ♪

01:18.999 --> 01:21.999
♪ We were meant to be free ♪

01:23.999 --> 01:26.999
♪ We were meant
to be beautiful ♪

01:26.999 --> 01:28.999
- Are we ready
for this?

01:28.999 --> 01:29.999
- I don't know.
I'm not, like,

01:29.999 --> 01:31.999
the best host in the world.

01:31.999 --> 01:32.999
I feel like you've
done this before,

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
'cause you already have
everything really cute.

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
Dani Shae,
who also works at Sur,

01:36.999 --> 01:39.999
has been in the house
for six months,

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
which I think is relatively new.

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
We're calling it
a housewarming party,

01:43.999 --> 01:46.999
but really, it's just
an excuse to get drunk.

01:46.999 --> 01:49.999
Welcome, and I hope you enjoy.

01:49.999 --> 01:50.999
- Who do we have
coming for sure?

01:50.999 --> 01:53.999
'Cause I've only invited
Kristina, Stassi,

01:53.999 --> 01:55.999
so who else could be coming?

01:55.999 --> 01:57.999
- Scheana and Ariana
said that they're both coming.

01:57.999 --> 02:00.999
- Okay.
- With Tom and Shay.

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
- Okay.
- I mean, I text Jax.

02:02.999 --> 02:03.999
All he said
was "Thank you so much,"

02:03.999 --> 02:05.999
so I don't know
if he's coming or not.

02:05.999 --> 02:08.999
- That'll be really interesting
with Stassi here too.

02:08.999 --> 02:10.999
- I know.
I keep forgetting her.

02:10.999 --> 02:13.999
Dani Shae and a couple
of my other friends

02:13.999 --> 02:15.999
absolutely love Stassi.

02:15.999 --> 02:17.999
I've met her one time.
I thought she was great.

02:17.999 --> 02:20.999
But the rest of
my Sur family--they don't have

02:20.999 --> 02:23.999
a lot of nice things
to say about this girl.

02:23.999 --> 02:25.999
- Kristina and Stassi
are coming over right now.

02:25.999 --> 02:26.999
- Oh, they're coming over
right now?

02:26.999 --> 02:28.000
- Yeah.

02:30.999 --> 02:33.000
- Do you miss living here?
- No.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.999
Although I do miss
having an apartment.

02:35.999 --> 02:39.999
- Yay!
- Oh, my gosh.

02:39.999 --> 02:41.999
- I haven't been here
in two years.

02:41.999 --> 02:43.999
white walls, black carpet.

02:43.999 --> 02:47.999
- It looks so much nicer
than when I lived here.

02:47.999 --> 02:48.999
- I can't believe I'm sweeping
your apartment right now.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.999
I'm such a bitch.

02:50.999 --> 02:52.999
- The thing is, if you just
wouldn't do stupid sh** at all,

02:52.999 --> 02:55.000
you wouldn't have
to be there sweeping.

02:55.999 --> 02:56.999
Hi. It's good to see you.

02:56.999 --> 02:59.999
- Welcome back home.
- Thank you. This is so weird.

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
When I moved
out of the apartment,

03:01.999 --> 03:03.999
Lala moved right in,
and then eventually,

03:03.999 --> 03:05.999
Dani moved in with her.

03:05.999 --> 03:06.999
I mean, that's the Sur family.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.999
You're in my room, right?
- Yes.

03:08.999 --> 03:10.999
- I want to see your room.
- Okay.

03:10.999 --> 03:15.999
- My history with Stassi--I was
18 in Vegas with Dani Shae

03:15.999 --> 03:16.999
and Kristina Kelly.

03:16.999 --> 03:18.999
We were doing a trade show,

03:18.999 --> 03:19.999
and I just remember coming
down the elevator

03:19.999 --> 03:22.999
and Stassi being like, "Stop.

03:22.999 --> 03:23.999
I love this outfit."

03:23.999 --> 03:25.999
- Oh, my gosh.
- Isn't it--

03:25.999 --> 03:27.999
- Yeah, and it looks so much
better than when I had it.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.999
- To have someone
older than me

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
who lives in L.A. tell me
that she likes my outfit,

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
I was like,
feeling good, you know?

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
- Are a lot of people coming?

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
- Ariana, Scheana,

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
their men, Tom and Shay.

03:38.999 --> 03:39.999
- Mm-hmm.

03:39.999 --> 03:41.999
- Did you just
get uncomfortable?

03:41.999 --> 03:43.999
- No, I mean, I just--I haven't
seen them in, like...

03:43.999 --> 03:45.999
- She shifted.
- A year.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
I don't know.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.999
I don't mind bumping into

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
Tom and Ariana
or even Scheana.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
I mean, I don't really
get along with those people,

03:53.999 --> 03:55.999
but I'm really interested

03:55.999 --> 03:57.999
in getting a friendship
back with Katie,

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
and she's friends with them,

03:59.999 --> 04:00.999
and I know
that it's inevitable.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.999
- Then you and I
can just team up,

04:02.999 --> 04:04.999
and we'll just be
like, "f*** everybody.

04:04.999 --> 04:05.999
I don't even
give a f*** anymore."

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
- I think that's
an excellent idea.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.999
- Yeah, I'm sure you do.

04:19.999 --> 04:21.999
- Everything's okay?
- Yeah.

04:21.999 --> 04:22.999
I'm just prepping
all this stuff.

04:22.999 --> 04:24.000
I want it to be
all clean and sparkly.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
- We go through a lot
of pinot noir here now.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
- It's so easy to drink.
- Yeah.

04:30.999 --> 04:31.999
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
Is this your first day back?

04:33.999 --> 04:35.999
- Well, literally,
it is two weeks to a T.

04:35.999 --> 04:36.999
So hopefully the dust
has settled a little bit

04:36.999 --> 04:37.999
on this whole thing.

04:37.999 --> 04:38.999
What I've done is wrong.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
I'm paying for it financially.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
I'm paying for it
with my friends.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
Thank God
my friends were there.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
- I don't know what I would have
done without them being there.

04:46.999 --> 04:47.999
- Like, I don't even
know what to say.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
I don't even know what to--

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
This is an expensive lesson
to learn.

04:51.999 --> 04:54.999
Are you guys going
to Lala's thing tonight?

04:54.999 --> 04:55.999
- Yeah, we're gonna
go by there.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
- We're gonna go.
- I really wanted to go.

04:57.999 --> 04:58.999
I really did,
but I think after Hawaii

04:58.999 --> 05:01.999
and the way Brittany
and Lala kind of--

05:01.999 --> 05:04.999
- Hello? I've been honest.
Be honest.

05:04.999 --> 05:05.999
- I am being honest.
- You're not.

05:05.999 --> 05:08.999
You told me
you would f*** me.

05:08.999 --> 05:09.999
- Might be good
to sit this one out.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.999
- Yeah, I think
I'm gonna.

05:11.999 --> 05:14.999
- You know Schwartz met up
with Stassi last night.

05:14.999 --> 05:15.999
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

05:15.999 --> 05:17.999
- Dude, I can't--
part of me feels like

05:17.999 --> 05:20.999
she targeted him 'cause
she knows he's weak.

05:20.999 --> 05:22.999
- She's thinking
every thought process out

05:22.999 --> 05:24.000
really carefully,
and the way

05:24.000 --> 05:26.999
she's going about trying
to get back into the group.

05:26.999 --> 05:27.999
- Hi.
- What's up, Lisa?

05:27.999 --> 05:28.999
Look who's back.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.999
- It's your favorite bartender.
- Taylor.

05:30.999 --> 05:31.999
What are you doing here?
- Look what the cat dragged in.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
- Well, it's been two weeks.

05:33.999 --> 05:34.999
- Hey, will you help me with
the coffee machine real quick?

05:34.999 --> 05:36.000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hi.

05:36.999 --> 05:37.999
- What's going on?
- Well, it's been two weeks.

05:37.999 --> 05:39.999
- Two amazing weeks, Jax.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.999
- No, it hasn't been
two amazing weeks.

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
Not for me, anyway.
- I said what I had to say.

05:43.999 --> 05:45.999
- No, I know.
What I did in Hawaii

05:45.999 --> 05:48.999
has nothing to do with my life
in f***ing Los Angeles,

05:48.999 --> 05:50.999
but I'm just gonna sit there
and nod and smile.

05:50.999 --> 05:53.000
No, ma'am.
I'm very sorry.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.999
I will never do it again.
It was a big mistake.

05:55.999 --> 05:57.999
It won't happen again.
I've learned a lot from it.

05:57.999 --> 05:58.999
I've had a lot of time
to think about it.

05:58.999 --> 06:01.999
- Maybe now is the time
for you to do, yeah,

06:01.999 --> 06:02.999
some positive work.

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
Stop thinking about yourself.

06:04.999 --> 06:05.999
What he did in Hawaii

06:05.999 --> 06:08.999
was totally all about him,
and he got busted.

06:08.999 --> 06:11.999
I want Jax to stop
thinking about Jax Taylor

06:11.999 --> 06:13.999
and start thinking
about other people.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.000
You remember
Covenant House, right?

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
All the kids that came here,
and we did the dinner for them?

06:17.999 --> 06:18.999
- Uh-huh.

06:18.999 --> 06:20.000
- And I hope you're all hungry,
you guys.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
- So we're doing
a clothing drive,

06:24.999 --> 06:27.999
and you can, you know, get
some stuff of yours in there.

06:27.999 --> 06:28.999
- I've seen that.
I know Tom and Tom

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
have tons of stuff, too,
that they would love to give.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
- Come with the guys
to the house, and,

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
you know, start doing
some good for others.

06:34.999 --> 06:35.999
- I would love to do that.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
- I don't think
you're a bad person.

06:37.999 --> 06:38.999
- I'm not a bad person.
- Sometimes you do bad things.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
- I just do dumb things.
I'm working on that.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
- Hi!
- Hey.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
- Welcome, welcome.
- Thanks.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
It smells good in here.
- Hi.

06:53.999 --> 06:55.999
- Tom's wearing--
- Do I see-

06:55.999 --> 06:58.000
Oh!
- What?

06:58.999 --> 07:01.999
- You guys are so cute.

07:01.999 --> 07:04.999
- Lala wears the hoop earrings
better than anybody

07:04.999 --> 07:07.999
except J.Lo and Beyonce.

07:07.999 --> 07:08.999
I love it.
I'm telling you, though,

07:08.999 --> 07:11.999
I do need new gold hoops,
so don't take them out.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.999
- It's awkward.
- We bought you a gift--

07:13.999 --> 07:14.999
- Yeah, we got you guys
a housewarming present.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.999
- To sort of, like,
class up the joint.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- I'm gonna try and make eye
contact right now.

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
- You know we both need that.
- Yeah.

07:21.999 --> 07:22.999
- You guys are so--
- Really?

07:22.999 --> 07:24.999
- Aww. You did not need
to bring anything.

07:24.999 --> 07:27.999
- I really want you to see
that this is deliberate.

07:32.999 --> 07:35.999
- That's rude.
- We can't just.

07:35.999 --> 07:36.999
I'm gonna throw up.

07:42.999 --> 07:46.000
You know, I knew it was gonna
be awkward to see Sandoval,

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
but, like,
it's really awkward,

07:48.999 --> 07:50.000
because he's just
ignoring me.

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
- Let's make shots.
- Let's make shots.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
Hey.
Remember me?

07:54.999 --> 07:57.999
We used to be friends for,
like, a really long time.

07:57.999 --> 07:58.999
And I know we don't
like each other,

07:58.999 --> 08:00.999
but I still exist.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.999
- You guys, we made shots.
- Oh, wait.

08:04.999 --> 08:08.999
- We made--'cause this is
awkward and weird, so here.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
- These are icebreakers.

08:10.999 --> 08:11.999
- Yes.
- Cheers.

08:11.999 --> 08:14.000
- I'm definitely not gonna
put up with any of her sh** now,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.999
and I'm not gonna get
emotional or upset.

08:16.999 --> 08:19.999
I'm just gonna be
very cut and dry.

08:23.999 --> 08:27.999
- It's been a while
since we did that walk.

08:27.999 --> 08:29.999
The fact that Stassi's gonna
be there--I mean, fine,

08:29.999 --> 08:30.999
that doesn't change my mind.

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
I'm still gonna go,
because I do not run away

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
from that girl.

08:34.999 --> 08:36.999
I haven't liked Stassi
for a very long time.

08:36.999 --> 08:39.999
So...my tables are done.

08:39.999 --> 08:42.999
What side work,
or what do I need to do?

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
- You need to polish
all the glasses in the main room

08:44.999 --> 08:47.999
and then make sure
the coffee bar is cleaned.

08:47.999 --> 08:48.999
- Thank you, Katie.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
I have no idea
what I'm going to say to her,

08:50.999 --> 08:54.999
but I gotta think of something
good to start this off.

08:54.999 --> 08:56.999
Hi.
- Hi, babes. Hi, loves.

08:56.999 --> 08:57.999
How are you guys?

08:57.999 --> 08:59.999
- Good. How are you?

08:59.999 --> 09:01.999
- Smile.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.999
- It's been, like, a year
since I've talked to Scheana.

09:03.999 --> 09:07.999
Do you think I want to hang out
with Kristen, Jax, you?

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
You know what my big problem
with you is.

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
I guess I just
choose my friends wisely.

09:11.999 --> 09:12.999
- That's why you don't
have that many.

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
- And every time I do it,
it makes me hate her more.

09:17.999 --> 09:21.999
- Sorry, my hands are full.
That's for you.

09:21.999 --> 09:22.999
- Thank you for that.
- You're welcome.

09:22.999 --> 09:24.999
- That's very clever.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
And I'm not really sure
what I've done to you,

09:26.999 --> 09:27.999
but I'll take a Pinot grigio.

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
- Pinot Gris?
- I had to.

09:31.999 --> 09:34.999
I haven't been friends with
Stassi in a very long time,

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
but I know two things
she likes:

09:36.999 --> 09:38.999
blue and Pinot grigio.

09:38.999 --> 09:39.999
So here you go, bitch.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.999
- Should we take more shots?

09:41.999 --> 09:44.999
- I'll do more shots.

09:44.999 --> 09:45.999
- I used to love confrontation.

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
Now it's like, f*** that.

09:49.999 --> 09:51.999
- Cheers!
- Oh!

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
- Are they all poisoned?

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
- Tequila.
- Ah, uh-huh.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.999
- It's definitely
a little awkward.

10:01.999 --> 10:02.999
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

10:04.999 --> 10:05.999
- Oh, my gosh, that is good.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.999
Kristina Kelly, I'm getting
you a little buzzed tonight.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
Are we good on drinks, babes?

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
- Oh, yeah.
I just poured myself a shot.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- I would love
a shot of tequila.

10:17.999 --> 10:20.999
- Okay. I'm certainly friendly
with Scheana right now.

10:20.999 --> 10:21.999
We're cool.
We can hang out.

10:21.999 --> 10:24.999
We obviously care a lot
about each other.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.999
The question is, will we be
best friends again?

10:27.999 --> 10:28.999
No.

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999
- I haven't spoken to you
in a really long time.

10:30.999 --> 10:34.000
- It's been a while.
It's nice to see you, though.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.999
Seeing Stassi is--it's almost
like seeing a ghost,

10:38.999 --> 10:41.999
but, like, a bitchy ghost.

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
Like a bitch ghost.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
Like a ghost that's a bitch.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
You know, it's just
like--and that's the thing.

10:47.999 --> 10:48.999
It's really hard to explain.

10:48.999 --> 10:51.999
I don't really know
where to go from here.

10:51.999 --> 10:52.999
- I'm figuring it out.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.999
- The thing is is, like,

10:54.999 --> 10:58.999
you're staying
with Kristen now, right?

10:58.999 --> 10:59.999
I don't know
if you realize, like,

10:59.999 --> 11:02.999
how much that basically
just kills anything

11:02.999 --> 11:03.999
that you've ever stood for.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.000
- I don't think so.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.999
Because what I have--
- And let me tell you why.

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
Let me tell you why.
- Okay.

11:08.999 --> 11:11.999
- What that tells me
about you is that your issues

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
with Scheana and
your issues with Katie

11:14.999 --> 11:18.999
were all really bullsh**,
because if somebody

11:18.999 --> 11:19.999
is not benefitting you
in a certain way,

11:19.999 --> 11:22.999
it's like you'll just
discard them.

11:24.999 --> 11:28.999
Stassi is trying to make sense
of why she cut off Katie,

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
because Katie was
friends with Scheana,

11:30.999 --> 11:33.999
because Scheana supposedly
put the sex tape out.

11:33.999 --> 11:36.999
When you preach about morals
in such an egotistical way,

11:36.999 --> 11:40.999
and then conveniently start
sleeping on Kristen's couch,

11:40.999 --> 11:41.999
how can you really
trust anything

11:41.999 --> 11:43.000
that comes out of her mouth?

11:43.999 --> 11:44.999
- When somebody hurts me
to the point

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
where I feel like,
"f*** that,"

11:46.999 --> 11:48.999
it's--you're done.
And I cut people out.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
- That's why
it's f***ed up, Stassi,

11:50.999 --> 11:51.999
and there's
consequences for that.

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999
- Everybody handles
things differently.

11:52.999 --> 11:54.000
- It doesn't--and that's not
an excuse.

11:54.999 --> 11:55.999
- Everybody--but I--

11:55.999 --> 11:58.999
- I have to, like--I have to
question your motives, Stassi.

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
If everything was going great
in Stassi's life

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
and she was going around
apologizing to people,

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
that would be one thing,

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
but the bitch is homeless.

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
Like, she's desperate.

12:07.999 --> 12:09.999
We'll finish this conversation
at a later time.

12:15.999 --> 12:16.999
- Coming up...

12:16.999 --> 12:18.000
- Listen, I was--
- No, Tom, you can't do that.

12:18.999 --> 12:19.999
- I felt bad 'cause
I was harsh on her.

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
I was really harsh.
- I don't care if you feel bad.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.999
♪ I love the night life,
the night life ♪

12:33.999 --> 12:37.999
♪ Oh, are you ready to go ♪

12:37.999 --> 12:40.999
♪ For one in a million ♪

12:40.999 --> 12:41.999
- Oh, this is nice.
I'm free tonight.

12:41.999 --> 12:43.999
Brittany's at
the Playboy mansion.

12:43.999 --> 12:44.999
- What is she doing?

12:44.999 --> 12:46.999
- She's working for Mony,
200 proof.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.999
- So, Hooters,
the Playboy mansion--

12:49.999 --> 12:51.999
Is it, like, a pajama--

12:51.999 --> 12:52.999
- Well, actually, she sent me
a picture, but this is, like--

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
- Wearing, like, a bra?
Oh, my God.

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
- Dude, she doesn't
need a boob job.

12:56.999 --> 12:57.999
Her boobs are nice.
- What? Wait.

12:57.999 --> 12:59.999
Wait, hold on.
She's gonna get a boob job?

12:59.999 --> 13:00.999
- Oh, you didn't
know about that?

13:00.999 --> 13:01.999
- She wants to get
her boobs done.

13:01.999 --> 13:03.999
- He's paying for it.
Just make sure it's not too big.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.999
- You guys ready to order
or need a few more minutes?

13:05.999 --> 13:07.999
- Can I have
the chicken quesadilla?

13:07.999 --> 13:09.999
- Chick--okay, perfect.
- Just chicken tacos.

13:09.999 --> 13:12.999
- Okay.
- Can I have the tostada fresca?

13:12.999 --> 13:13.999
- Tostada fresca with chicken.
Okay, thank you very much.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
- He eats that
everywhere we go.

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
- Okay.
- Thank you.

13:16.999 --> 13:19.999
- I heard a little--what--
something happened yesterday?

13:19.999 --> 13:20.999
- Well, I mean,
Lala comes up to me--

13:20.999 --> 13:22.999
- And was she topless?

13:29.999 --> 13:30.999
- No.

13:30.999 --> 13:32.999
So then she goes--she's
like, "I get it.

13:32.999 --> 13:33.999
We don't like each other."

13:33.999 --> 13:35.000
- Like this.
Did she get all snappy?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.999
- I'm like, okay, well,
her attitude was so snotty.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
- Well, I just wanted to let
you know that I will be having

13:39.999 --> 13:43.999
a party that I obviously
don't want you to attend.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
- So first of all,
I would not expect an invitation

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
or want an invitation.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
- You should be like,
"Yeah, it's okay."

13:49.999 --> 13:50.999
- I mean,
Stassi's gonna be there.

13:50.999 --> 13:51.999
Like, why would I go?
- Oh, my God.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.999
I definitely avoided
a huge train wreck.

13:54.999 --> 13:55.999
- Is Scheana
with Stassi right now?

13:55.999 --> 13:57.999
- Yes.

14:01.999 --> 14:05.999
- Welcome to my and
Lala's humble abode.

14:05.999 --> 14:07.999
Thank you for coming.
- Thank you guys for coming.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
- What can I get you, babe?
You want a beer?

14:19.999 --> 14:20.999
- Thank you.

14:24.999 --> 14:26.999
Are you f***ing kidding me?

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
- Okay, fine.
Cheers.

14:28.999 --> 14:29.999
- Cheers.

14:32.999 --> 14:34.999
So, how's life?

14:34.999 --> 14:39.999
- Um, I'm okay.
- I've heard a lot of things.

14:39.999 --> 14:40.999
I don't know what's true
and what's not,

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
'cause you can't believe
everything you hear, and--

14:42.999 --> 14:43.999
- That's true.
And I don't know

14:43.999 --> 14:45.000
what you've heard,
so I don't know what's--

14:45.999 --> 14:47.999
- I know you're staying with
Kristen right now--the person

14:47.999 --> 14:50.999
who you hated the most,
and that was your issues

14:50.999 --> 14:52.999
with me and Katie going
to Miami, and you're like,

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
"Oh, you think I want to be
around people like Kristen?"

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
- No, no, no, wait.
Let me just establish the fact

14:56.999 --> 14:59.999
that my issue with Katie
was not about Kristen.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.999
It was about you.

15:01.999 --> 15:05.999
Should I bring up
why I actually hate Scheana?

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
If I hated somebody
and I saw

15:07.999 --> 15:11.999
that their ex-boyfriend
was showing a video,

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
I would get
on the phone immediately.

15:13.999 --> 15:15.999
First of all, I would say,
put that f***ing sh** away.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.999
- You're the one
who f***ing told me about it.

15:17.999 --> 15:18.999
- I did tell you about it.
- In the middle of work,

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
laughing about it.
- I did tell you about it.

15:20.999 --> 15:21.999
- She showed it
to a sh** ton of people.

15:21.999 --> 15:22.999
- And then I just felt like,

15:22.999 --> 15:26.999
"Why am I ever gonna talk
to any of these people again?"

15:26.999 --> 15:27.999
It was the darkest point
in my life.

15:27.999 --> 15:31.999
But that is where
my hurt came from,

15:31.999 --> 15:33.999
and that is where--when
Katie--all of a sudden,

15:33.999 --> 15:36.999
I heard that Katie was going
to your bridal shower,

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
and then to
your bachelorette party,

15:38.999 --> 15:40.999
that's what it was about.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
- I didn't like you at the time,
when that was going around.

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
- But it doesn't actually matter
if you like somebody or not.

15:44.999 --> 15:46.999
That's, like, a line
that should never be crossed.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.999
- And that's what
I've apologized for,

15:48.999 --> 15:49.999
but I'm finishing my sentence,

15:49.999 --> 15:52.999
so when Hugh asked me
for my contact

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
with every website out there,

15:54.999 --> 15:56.999
I said, "Are
you f***ing kidding me?

15:56.999 --> 15:57.999
Absolutely f***ing not."

15:57.999 --> 15:58.999
And I told him,

15:58.999 --> 16:01.999
"You cannot do this."

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
So I'm very sorry
that you've heard that

16:03.999 --> 16:06.999
and that you've felt that way
about me for the past year

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
and a f***ing half
or however long it's been,

16:08.999 --> 16:09.999
but I would absolutely
never do that.

16:14.999 --> 16:18.999
Like, that's so f***ing low.

16:18.999 --> 16:20.999
I could never do something
like that to anybody.

16:22.999 --> 16:25.999
Not even you.
- Okay.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
- So I'm really sorry
that you thought that.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.999
- I really appreciate that,

16:29.999 --> 16:31.999
and I really
actually--I believe you.

16:33.999 --> 16:35.999
Scheana denied having

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
any involvement
for a year and a half,

16:37.999 --> 16:40.999
and if she just would have
admitted to the little part

16:40.999 --> 16:42.999
she played in it back then,

16:42.999 --> 16:44.999
I would have gone to Miami,

16:44.999 --> 16:46.999
probably would have gone
to her wedding,

16:46.999 --> 16:48.999
Katie and I would
still be friends.

16:48.999 --> 16:51.999
I am just happy to get
this story straight now.

16:51.999 --> 16:54.999
I have realized that, like,
I have lost out on a lot

16:54.999 --> 16:56.999
of things and a lot
of good people

16:56.999 --> 16:57.999
because that's how I cope.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.999
Like, that's
how I protect myself.

16:59.999 --> 17:02.999
It's like, "f*** you,
you're done,"

17:02.999 --> 17:06.999
and that is where I was wrong.

17:06.999 --> 17:09.999
- There is still a part
of Stassi that is self-serving.

17:09.999 --> 17:10.999
You know, she wants
her friends back.

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
But hearing Stassi
say she was wrong,

17:13.999 --> 17:15.999
that felt really good.

17:15.999 --> 17:18.000
I need more tequila.
I don't know if you do.

17:18.999 --> 17:19.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:19.999 --> 17:20.999
- I need a cocktail.

17:26.999 --> 17:28.999
- Are you getting any updates?

17:28.999 --> 17:29.999
- She gave her the bottle
of Pinot grigio,

17:29.999 --> 17:32.999
and she just said, "She said
it was a clever gift."

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
- That's awesome.
- Stassi's also

17:34.999 --> 17:37.999
in this apology tour
kind of situation,

17:37.999 --> 17:40.999
which brings me to you.

17:40.999 --> 17:41.999
- You went out with her,
didn't you?

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
- Yeah.
- What happened?

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
- I mean, it was pretty brutal.

17:45.999 --> 17:46.999
- Did she say, "Hey, I want
to be friends again"?

17:46.999 --> 17:48.999
What did she--

17:48.999 --> 17:49.999
- I told her the prospects
of you guys rekindling

17:49.999 --> 17:52.999
that friendship
is--it's farfetched.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
- But I mean, for me, like,
I don't want to talk to her,

17:54.999 --> 17:57.999
see her, because she hurt me,
and, like, I had this,

17:57.999 --> 18:00.999
like, unwavering loyalty to her
that she took advantage of.

18:00.999 --> 18:03.999
I mourned my friendship
with Stassi,

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
and I mourned it
until I forgot,

18:05.999 --> 18:08.999
and all those feelings
have come back up

18:08.999 --> 18:10.999
now that she's back.

18:10.999 --> 18:11.999
My life is a lot different
than it was a year ago.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.999
- Right.

18:13.999 --> 18:14.999
What did she say about
the engagement, by the way?

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
Did she say anything?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
I invited her to
the engagement party.

18:18.999 --> 18:19.999
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.999
- No, you--what?

18:20.999 --> 18:21.999
- I invited her
to the engagement party.

18:23.999 --> 18:24.999
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
- No, no, no. No. No.
- 'Cause I was so--

18:26.999 --> 18:29.999
- No, Tom.
No, Tom, you can't do that.

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
- Listen, I was so mean
to her that I felt like--

18:31.999 --> 18:32.999
- Tom!
- Listen.

18:32.999 --> 18:33.999
Listen.
Let me just explain.

18:33.999 --> 18:34.999
- First of all,
it's our engagement party,

18:34.999 --> 18:35.999
so you don't invite--

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
- Let me explain.
Can I explain?

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
- Anyone without
consulting with me.

18:39.999 --> 18:41.999
Why would you just extend
an invitation like that?

18:41.999 --> 18:44.999
- Because I felt bad 'cause
I've--I was harsh on her.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.999
I was really harsh.
- I don't care if you feel bad.

18:46.999 --> 18:49.999
Tom of anybody knows that
I don't want to see Stassi

18:50.000 --> 18:51.999
and I don't want her
at my engagement party.

18:51.999 --> 18:54.999
You have to realize,
that was my best friend,

18:54.999 --> 18:56.999
and you saw me
when it happened.

18:56.999 --> 18:58.999
I was destroyed by it.
- I know, I know.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Maybe I was a little gung ho

19:01.000 --> 19:02.999
with the invitation
to the engagement party.

19:02.999 --> 19:05.000
Maybe I didn't fully think
it through, you know?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.999
Maybe I am a sucker,

19:06.999 --> 19:12.000
but if you ask me,
I'd say Stassi is changed.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.999
- Even now what
she's doing is selfish.

19:14.999 --> 19:15.999
- Well--yeah, it is.

19:15.999 --> 19:16.999
- Like, this is selfish
what she's doing.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.999
This is a really
good time in my life...

19:18.999 --> 19:20.999
- But it's--yeah, I know.
You're right.

19:20.999 --> 19:21.999
- And she's, like,
tainting this right now.

19:21.999 --> 19:23.999
- I told her to reel it back
and tread lightly.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.999
- You don't do what you did.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.999
and walk away for a year,
and then, like,

19:27.999 --> 19:29.999
a text message is gonna,
like, win me over.

19:29.999 --> 19:31.999
x- Yeah, a year later.
- It's not gonna happen.

19:38.999 --> 19:41.999
It's just like,
I want so bad

19:41.999 --> 19:44.999
for her to realize
what she did and,

19:44.999 --> 19:45.999
like, realize kind of, like,

19:45.999 --> 19:47.999
the friend I was to her,
but, like,

19:47.999 --> 19:48.999
I don't think she's
ever gonna realize that,

19:48.999 --> 19:50.999
and that's what's, like,
really hard is just, like,

19:50.999 --> 19:51.999
I don't think she's--
she's never gonna get it,

19:51.999 --> 19:54.999
because she doesn't know
how to be a friend.

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
- Coming up...

19:56.999 --> 19:58.999
- You got through to Schwartz,
you got through to Scheana.

19:58.999 --> 19:59.999
These are stepping stones
to get to Katie.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
Like, you're working your way
up the totem pole.

20:01.999 --> 20:02.999
- Mm-hmm.

20:02.999 --> 20:04.999
- And you have a shot.
- And I have a shot.

20:15.999 --> 20:17.999
- Breakfast is served.
- Yeah.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
- Red Bull and vodka at noon.

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
And just, can I say,
you are the most fun person

20:21.999 --> 20:23.999
I've ever lived with.

20:23.999 --> 20:24.999
- I'm really--right?
I'm really fun.

20:24.999 --> 20:25.999
- You are.

20:25.999 --> 20:27.999
- It's because I'm happy.
- Maybe I won't get my own home.

20:27.999 --> 20:29.999
Kristen is just fun.

20:29.999 --> 20:32.999
I mean, she's laid-back
and relaxed with me,

20:32.999 --> 20:33.999
and she wants to drink
all the time.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.999
I mean, like, at any hour.

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
Lala--it was at her--
well, my apartment.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
- Oh, yeah.
- My apartment.

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
- In your bedroom.
- In my bedroom. First of all--

20:42.999 --> 20:43.999
- She's, like,
super ghetto, and...

20:43.999 --> 20:46.999
- No. Well, she wasn't
dressed classy.

20:46.999 --> 20:49.999
- But she's not classy,
so I wouldn't assume.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
- Like, I'm telling you,
she was so nice to me.

20:51.999 --> 20:52.999
- Like, I can't--I just,

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
like, can't with Lala.
I can't.

20:54.999 --> 20:58.999
I was not formally invited
to Lala's stupid party.

20:58.999 --> 20:59.999
You know how some people
are, like,

20:59.999 --> 21:02.999
a step down from where you are?

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
Lala's, like,
a few stories down.

21:04.999 --> 21:07.999
Like, many,
many flights of stairs

21:07.999 --> 21:08.999
down from where I'm at.

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
- Oh, my God, so much
happened last night.

21:10.999 --> 21:12.999
Okay, Scheana and Shay
walk in, and I'm, like,

21:12.999 --> 21:14.999
"Time to make shots."
And so--

21:14.999 --> 21:17.999
- If I could be a fly
on that f***ing wall.

21:17.999 --> 21:20.999
- Yeah. I genuinely
believe in her apology.

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
And she owned up to it,
and then right

21:22.999 --> 21:25.999
when she did that,
I was like, "Oh, my God.

21:25.999 --> 21:28.999
I can let any of this"--like,
I feel like now I can let it go.

21:28.999 --> 21:29.999
- Yeah.
- And then when I was talking

21:29.999 --> 21:30.999
to Scheana and
we were getting

21:30.999 --> 21:31.999
to a place where
we were both like,

21:31.999 --> 21:34.999
"I understand you
and I understand you," and--

21:34.999 --> 21:35.999
- You were like, "I want
Scheana back in my life."

21:35.999 --> 21:37.999
- And I'm like,
"I actually think

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
I want to go have a drink
with you and hang out."

21:39.999 --> 21:40.999
- Yeah. It just
feels so much better,

21:40.999 --> 21:42.999
like, if we have our whole
family back together.

21:42.999 --> 21:45.999
- It's not really back together.
- Not yet. It will be.

21:45.999 --> 21:48.999
- No, but it's--it's just--
it was a very--

21:48.999 --> 21:50.999
- You got through to Schwartz,
you got through to Scheana.

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
These are stepping stones
to get to Katie.

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
Like, you're working your way
up the totem pole.

21:53.999 --> 21:55.999
I really miss the days

21:55.999 --> 21:56.999
when it was
Katie, Stassi, and I,

21:56.999 --> 21:59.000
and as badly
as I want us to be

21:59.000 --> 22:01.999
one big happy family
all over again,

22:01.999 --> 22:03.999
it's not gonna happen
that fast,

22:03.999 --> 22:05.000
and you can't force
anyone on anyone.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.999
- I feel like if I can
get, like, the people

22:07.999 --> 22:11.999
that have been hating me
to actually believe me,

22:11.999 --> 22:14.999
then I feel like I'm
one step closer to Katie.

22:14.999 --> 22:16.999
- I think you have a shot.
- I have a shot.

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
- My band
is called Charles McMansion.

22:43.999 --> 22:46.999
My inspiration
for the music is,

22:46.999 --> 22:48.999
"Let's get people
off their ass

22:48.999 --> 22:50.000
and get 'em dancing."

22:50.999 --> 22:51.999
Dude, I'm shooting
the music video--I mean,

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
I'll already be
paying for production.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
Like, we brought in
session musicians--

23:00.999 --> 23:03.999
Yeah, just palm mute it?

23:03.999 --> 23:04.999
Yeah.

23:04.999 --> 23:07.999
- Holy sh**, what kind
of tab are you running up?

23:07.999 --> 23:08.999
- Dude, it's not cheap.

23:08.999 --> 23:09.999
I'm already in
the thousands for the song.

23:09.999 --> 23:12.999
- I'd, like, imagine, yeah.
- I mean, I need to make money.

23:12.999 --> 23:14.999
Speaking of which, man...
- Yeah.

23:14.999 --> 23:16.999
- So you ready for
this meeting or what?

23:16.999 --> 23:19.999
We have a meeting
with Pandora and Jason,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
and every meeting I feel
like there's been a lot of,

23:21.999 --> 23:22.999
like, Schwartz talking

23:22.999 --> 23:24.999
and me having
to do damage control,

23:24.999 --> 23:27.999
and I feel like I haven't
been able to sort of slide

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
in to my vibe and my game.

23:29.999 --> 23:31.999
- If I'm being honest
with you,

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
my feet got a little cold.

23:33.999 --> 23:34.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
- Why?

23:36.999 --> 23:39.999
- I feel like I'm either all in
with this or I'm all out.

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
There's no in between for me,

23:41.999 --> 23:45.999
and I think I'm all out, dude.

23:47.999 --> 23:48.999
For me, it's like, still,

23:48.999 --> 23:51.999
when I go to auditions
and castings,

23:51.999 --> 23:52.999
like, it's fun,
it's exciting.

23:52.999 --> 23:53.999
I've been doing pretty good

23:53.999 --> 23:54.999
with the modeling
and the acting stuff.

23:54.999 --> 23:57.999
I'm not killing,
but I'm doing pretty good.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
- Yeah, that looks good.

24:02.999 --> 24:05.999
- And right now I want
to focus on that,

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
and I don't need a job
getting in the way.

24:07.999 --> 24:10.999
- Did you tell Katie?
- No, I haven't told Katie yet.

24:10.999 --> 24:11.999
I didn't really even
think about that.

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
- Dude, she's gonna
f***ing kill you.

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
Like, why not just
do this part-time?

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
- I think she'll understand.
I think she'll understand.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.999
She's gonna understand.
Listen, and what else can I say?

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
- I don't think
she's gonna understand.

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
I think she's gonna
be f***ing pissed.

24:23.999 --> 24:24.999
- Don't give me that f***ing
smirk, she's gonna understand.

24:24.999 --> 24:25.999
- Dude.

24:25.999 --> 24:26.999
You're gonna be kicking
yourself

24:26.999 --> 24:27.999
in a couple months
from now.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.000
- Eh, we'll see.

24:29.999 --> 24:30.999
- When I'm basically
getting paid to party.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
- Is everything okay?

24:44.999 --> 24:46.999
- Did you want another glass
of the white?

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.999
- How many covers
did we do tonight?

24:50.999 --> 24:53.999
- There was a little
over 300, so,

24:53.999 --> 24:55.000
good for a Tuesday.

24:55.999 --> 24:56.999
- Any problems?

24:56.999 --> 24:59.999
- No. Everyone has been happy.
- Happy?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
- Yeah. No mistakes.
- That's what I like to hear.

25:01.999 --> 25:05.999
- Mm-hmm. I saw Miss Stassi
the other night.

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
- Oh, I've seen her,
trust me.

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
- Yeah.

25:08.999 --> 25:12.999
It did not go anywhere
remotely close

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
to where I thought
it was going to go.

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
This is a lot for me to say,

25:16.999 --> 25:19.999
but I really believe
she's genuine.

25:19.999 --> 25:21.999
- Is she sorry?
- Mm-hmm.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.999
- But there's still
a part of me

25:23.999 --> 25:24.999
that actually looks at her

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
and wonders
how self-serving this is.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.999
- But it felt good to just
at least be able to let go...

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
- Cathartic.
- Of hurt and anger

25:31.999 --> 25:32.999
and all of that.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.999
- You're always forgiving.
You want everybody to get on.

25:34.999 --> 25:35.999
That's who you are.
- Yeah.

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
- I think Scheana wants to live
in this ideal world

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
with unicorns and rainbows,

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
and she doesn't actually hold

25:41.999 --> 25:44.999
people accountable
for their actions.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
She forsakes
their responsibility.

25:46.999 --> 25:48.999
And I think
sometimes she might sweep

25:48.999 --> 25:50.999
just a little too much
under that rug.

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
I don't know how Katie's
gonna feel, though.

25:52.999 --> 25:55.999
- She's still not there,
- I don't think it's that easy.

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
You didn't have as much invested

25:56.999 --> 25:58.999
in the relationship
as Katie did.

25:58.999 --> 26:01.999
- No.
- Katie's deferential to Stassi,

26:01.999 --> 26:03.999
and then suddenly, when
Stassi treats her like sh**,

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
you saw the emancipation
of Katie.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
You saw Katie kind
of suddenly come up,

26:07.999 --> 26:08.999
become her own person.

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
- I think they should
have a conversation

26:10.999 --> 26:14.999
so Katie can get just everything
that's still bothering her out.

26:14.999 --> 26:15.999
- Let Katie do it
in her own time.

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
- Oh, no, I'm not,
like, encouraging it.

26:17.999 --> 26:18.999
- Okay. Come on.
Let's get back to this.

26:18.999 --> 26:19.999
- All right.

26:28.999 --> 26:29.999
- Feels good to do that.
- Yeah?

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
- Feels good
to be shaking again.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
- Welcome back, dude.
Welcome back.

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
- I'm back. I'm a little rusty.
- It's all good.

26:35.999 --> 26:38.999
- Tomorrow we have Kyle Chan's
thing--are you going to that?

26:38.999 --> 26:39.999
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- That should be a fun event.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.999
Should be all right.
- Yeah, it'll be fun, dude.

26:41.999 --> 26:42.999
Kyle Chan is
an LA jewelry designer,

26:42.999 --> 26:45.999
and actually designed the ring
that Schwartz gave to Katie.

26:45.999 --> 26:48.999
He's throwing a party at Pump
celebrating marriage equality.

26:48.999 --> 26:49.999
- And then I guess,
what, Scheana's gonna

26:49.999 --> 26:51.999
have some people over after?

26:51.999 --> 26:52.999
- Yeah, I think
maybe I heard that.

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
I don't know.
We'll see how we feel.

26:54.999 --> 26:55.999
Probably gonna be kind
of working a little bit.

26:55.999 --> 26:58.999
Like, I'm meeting with
a producer and director

26:58.999 --> 27:00.999
and basically, like,
got to figure out, like,

27:00.999 --> 27:02.999
how I'm gonna come up
with funds, so--

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
- I mean, you took on a lot
of projects right now.

27:04.999 --> 27:05.999
- I am.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.999
- Maybe a little bit more
than you can chew.

27:07.999 --> 27:08.999
- I like being busy.

27:08.999 --> 27:09.999
- I'm not trying to be a dick,

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
but I'm tired of hearing about
the goddamn band all the time.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
You know, I want to be
a good friend

27:13.999 --> 27:14.999
and have some faith in you,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.999
but I don't think you're gonna
follow through with this.

27:16.999 --> 27:18.000
Sorry.

27:18.999 --> 27:19.999
- "Touch in Public."
- "Touch in Public."

27:19.999 --> 27:24.999
- "TIP."
Just the tip.

27:24.999 --> 27:25.999
- Coming up...

27:25.999 --> 27:26.999
This is the second time
you've wimped out,

27:26.999 --> 27:29.999
just like a big bloody,
wussy pussy.

27:41.999 --> 27:43.000
- Well, who's this for again?

27:43.999 --> 27:44.999
- Doesn't matter what it's for.
We're helping out kids.

27:44.999 --> 27:47.000
Oh, my God.
Hey.

27:47.999 --> 27:48.999
Your closet's the same size
as my apartment.

27:48.999 --> 27:50.999
- Show me what you're giving.

27:50.999 --> 27:51.999
- Look at these,
brand-new boots.

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
They were a gift,
but they're too big.

27:52.999 --> 27:54.000
- You know,
I love helping people out,

27:54.000 --> 27:55.999
and this is a great cause.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
And if it makes Ken
and Lisa like me more,

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
I'm all for it.
It's a win-win.

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
- These are like brand new--
brand-new stuff.

28:01.999 --> 28:05.999
- I mean, this has got
a bloody security tag on.

28:05.999 --> 28:07.000
- Oh, see? Lookit.
That's nice.

28:07.999 --> 28:08.999
- Oh, that's nice, yeah.

28:08.999 --> 28:10.000
- Dolce & Gabbana?
- What is this jewelry?

28:10.999 --> 28:12.000
- Can I have this?
I could get this tailored.

28:12.999 --> 28:13.999
- Schwartzy!
- Jax, try this on.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.999
- Jax, do not be trying
any of that on.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.999
I'm hoping that they're not
gonna take

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
some of Ken's clothes

28:19.999 --> 28:22.999
and put them
in their own wardrobes.

28:22.999 --> 28:23.999
It should take you
five minutes.

28:23.999 --> 28:26.999
But I have a feeling
I'm hoping for too much.

28:26.999 --> 28:27.999
Whoever brought that...

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
- Whoa.
- Disgusting.

28:29.999 --> 28:30.999
- That's--
dude, that's one of--

28:30.999 --> 28:32.999
this is from a sheet girl
right here, dude.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
- Yeah.
- These are so nice.

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
- Hey, guys, look.

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
Right there.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
- What the--oh, my God.
- Right there, guys.

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
- Let me see. Let me see.
Is that nipple?

28:41.999 --> 28:42.999
- Oh, whoa, whoa.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
- Dude, I am taking that
to the spank bank.

28:44.999 --> 28:47.999
- Click.
- That's going straight to the--

28:47.999 --> 28:48.999
- Going right
to the highway reel.

28:48.999 --> 28:49.999
- Straight to the highway reel.
My God. Dude, she's really hot.

28:49.999 --> 28:52.999
I think I'm having second
thoughts about Katie now.

28:52.999 --> 28:56.999
I've often fantasized about
what Lisa looks like topless,

28:56.999 --> 28:59.999
and I think I just got
to seize this moment

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
and, you know, indulge.

29:01.999 --> 29:02.999
- She is gorgeous.

29:02.999 --> 29:04.999
- Take it all in.

29:04.999 --> 29:05.999
- Hey, guys.
How's it going?

29:05.999 --> 29:06.999
- Good.
- Hey.

29:06.999 --> 29:07.999
- So, Lisa wants you
downstairs.

29:07.999 --> 29:08.999
She wants to talk to you.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
- Dreading seeing Lisa,

29:11.999 --> 29:14.999
because I seek Lisa's approval,
and just knowing

29:14.999 --> 29:15.999
that she's going
to be disappointed in me

29:15.999 --> 29:18.999
about quitting the sangria
thing is killing me,

29:18.999 --> 29:21.999
but I still feel like I made
the right decision.

29:22.999 --> 29:23.999
- Okay, let's cut to the chase.

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
You know why I wanted
to talk to you, right?

29:25.999 --> 29:27.999
- Yeah.
- Pandy told me

29:27.999 --> 29:28.999
that you told her

29:28.999 --> 29:32.999
that you can't commit
to doing the LVP sangria.

29:32.999 --> 29:33.999
- I think I was naive
about the amount

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
of time necessary to commit,

29:35.999 --> 29:38.999
and I feel like if I do this,
I wanted to go 100% on this,

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
and I'm not ready
to go all in.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
- This is the second time
you've wimped out,

29:42.999 --> 29:45.999
just like a big bloody,
wussy pussy.

29:45.999 --> 29:48.999
- I felt like sh** about this,
to be honest.

29:48.999 --> 29:51.999
However, the reason which I
backed out--I thought to myself,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.999
hypothetically,
I did book a job,

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
but also I had a date booked
with Pandora and Jason,

29:55.999 --> 29:58.999
and due to an event,
I would choose the job,

29:58.999 --> 29:59.999
and I felt like
that's not fair

29:59.999 --> 30:02.999
for them to be
in the back seat, you know?

30:02.999 --> 30:04.999
- You are now entering
a different phase for your life

30:04.999 --> 30:06.999
where you have asked Katie
to marry you.

30:06.999 --> 30:08.000
And so you've got to follow
through with the rest

30:08.000 --> 30:09.999
of your life with commitment.

30:09.999 --> 30:12.999
Committing to things.
I've worked my ass off,

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
because that's--when you want
to get from here to there,

30:14.999 --> 30:15.999
you have to work your ass off.

30:15.999 --> 30:17.000
- Yeah.
- You don't have to faff around

30:17.000 --> 30:18.999
going to
little bloody casting.

30:18.999 --> 30:20.999
- The idea is I'm building up
to something, and I--

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
- Well, how long is it gonna
take you to build up to that?

30:22.999 --> 30:25.999
- Well, I got a late start.
I'm making excuses for myself.

30:25.999 --> 30:26.999
- That's exactly
what you're doing.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.999
I mean, it's no surprise
that Schwartzy quit.

30:29.999 --> 30:32.000
We were doing, actually,
quite well without him.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
I just thought that maybe
he wanted to do something

30:36.999 --> 30:37.999
for his future.

30:37.999 --> 30:39.999
You have got to, you know,

30:39.999 --> 30:42.999
make a few changes,
I think, in your life.

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
- Duly noted.
- All right, let's go.

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
- All right. Thanks, Lisa.
- Bye, darling.

30:46.999 --> 30:47.999
- Bye.

31:01.999 --> 31:04.999
- I almost wore a belt
just like that girl.

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
- Oh, I thought you were talking
about the striped jacket.

31:06.999 --> 31:07.999
You know who that is?

31:08.999 --> 31:11.999
- Do you remember him?
- I don't know him.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.999
I never met him.
- Oh.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
So, I'm not
with Aleks anymore.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.999
We're still really good friends.
I love the guy.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
I mean, I can either sober up
right after dinner

31:20.999 --> 31:25.999
and go home,
or we could get drinks,

31:25.999 --> 31:28.999
and I can sleep
on your couch downstairs.

31:28.999 --> 31:31.999
We had sex four times,
and we're back to being friends.

31:31.999 --> 31:34.999
It's such
an incestuous group.

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
- Welcome to the family.

31:36.999 --> 31:37.999
Then I went on a dating app,

31:37.999 --> 31:41.999
and this guy was
my first right swipe.

31:41.999 --> 31:42.999
This is Carter.

31:51.999 --> 31:52.999
- Wait, did you guys know

31:52.999 --> 31:55.999
that she's not on the list
for this party?

31:55.999 --> 31:58.999
So Kristen has decided
to come to another party

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
that she wasn't invited to

32:01.999 --> 32:04.999
at a restaurant owned by
a woman who despises her.

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
The DJ is her very volatile

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
and very recent ex-boyfriend,

32:08.999 --> 32:10.999
with a guy on her arm.

32:10.999 --> 32:13.999
He probably has no idea
what the hell he's getting into.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
She's not supposed to be here.

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
Just another night
in the life of Kristen Doute.

32:23.999 --> 32:25.999
- Come over here.
- Oh, no.

32:25.999 --> 32:28.999
- That is, I knew it!
That is Ken's shirt.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.999
- I figured we would wear it
one night before--

32:30.999 --> 32:32.999
'cause I'm not gonna keep it.

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
- You're so predictable,
you know?

32:38.999 --> 32:40.999
How's it going?
- Good. It's going great.

32:40.999 --> 32:41.999
I'm having a lot
of fun, yeah.

32:41.999 --> 32:44.999
- All right, I don't want
any distractions tonight.

32:44.999 --> 32:45.999
- Right, right.

32:45.999 --> 32:46.999
- And what are
we drinking tonight?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
One drink, remember?
- One drink.

32:48.999 --> 32:50.999
Lisa's obviously given me
so much opportunity.

32:50.999 --> 32:54.999
She's trusted me, and she's been
such a good figure for me.

32:54.999 --> 32:57.999
I felt very bad
when I disrespected her.

32:57.999 --> 32:58.999
I've been doing
everything in the world...

32:58.999 --> 33:00.000
- Just calm down.
- And you still praise Jax

33:00.999 --> 33:02.999
for his monkey dumbf*** ass.

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
You know, so I've been a bit
of a drunken ass****,

33:04.999 --> 33:06.000
so time to pull back
on the drinking

33:06.000 --> 33:07.999
and be on my best behavior.

33:07.999 --> 33:09.999
- Keep focused on that.
- All right. Thank you, Lisa.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.000
- All right.

33:11.999 --> 33:12.999
- Coming up...

33:12.999 --> 33:13.999
- Can you stop acting
like you're the number one

33:13.999 --> 33:15.000
f***ing guy
in this group, man?

33:15.999 --> 33:16.999
I'm the number one guy
in this group.

33:16.999 --> 33:19.999
- Are you f***ing
kidding me, Jax?

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
- After party, your house?
- Yes, you guys

33:31.999 --> 33:33.999
are more than welcome
to come up after.

33:33.999 --> 33:35.999
- Honey, I want
to talk to you, though.

33:35.999 --> 33:36.999
- Okay.

33:36.999 --> 33:38.999
- Tom, here's the thing:

33:38.999 --> 33:40.999
we're gonna get married,

33:40.999 --> 33:41.999
and we're gonna have
a future together,

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
so now it kind of
is my business.

33:43.999 --> 33:44.999
- Yeah.

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
- I don't want you to be
passing up opportunities

33:46.999 --> 33:48.999
without even exploring them.

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
- I think Schwartz
came to the conclusion

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
that not at this time,
he just doesn't think he could,

33:52.999 --> 33:54.999
like, commit 100%.

33:54.999 --> 33:55.999
- Oh, God.

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999
We're gonna, you know,
eventually start a family,

33:57.999 --> 34:01.999
and I need to know
that you're gonna want to--

34:01.999 --> 34:02.999
- Bubie, I'm working on it.

34:02.999 --> 34:03.999
I know I'm kind
of a mess right now,

34:03.999 --> 34:04.999
and I talked about it
with Lisa.

34:04.999 --> 34:05.999
- I know it's not the same--
- I don't know

34:06.000 --> 34:07.999
what I'm doing right now.

34:07.999 --> 34:08.999
I'm working,
and in the meantime,

34:08.999 --> 34:10.999
I'm just sustaining
until I figure out

34:10.999 --> 34:12.999
exactly what I want to do.

34:12.999 --> 34:14.999
- I have bet everything
on this guy,

34:14.999 --> 34:17.999
and I don't want to be scared
that I picked the guy

34:17.999 --> 34:20.999
that can't commit to things
'cause he's scared of failing.

34:20.999 --> 34:21.999
- I've made progress--
- So here's a time

34:21.999 --> 34:23.999
where I'm not gonna
defend you to people anymore.

34:23.999 --> 34:24.999
I'm gonna be like,
"You know what? He is flighty.

34:24.999 --> 34:26.999
He is kind of,
like, fair weather."

34:26.999 --> 34:27.999
- That's fine.
- "You can't really rely on him,

34:27.999 --> 34:30.999
because he walks away
from job opportunities."

34:30.999 --> 34:32.999
- Have I ever not paid rent?

34:32.999 --> 34:34.999
Have I ever not paid
any of my bills on time?

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
Did I just buy you
your dream ring?

34:36.999 --> 34:38.999
You know?
Like, get off my back.

34:38.999 --> 34:41.999
- That was a pussy-ass
f*** you.

34:41.999 --> 34:43.999
If I was in a position
where I was trying to transition

34:43.999 --> 34:45.999
out of acting and modeling--

34:45.999 --> 34:47.999
- Well, you never
did it in the first place,

34:47.999 --> 34:48.999
so don't compare
what you did to me.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.999
- Never did what?
- You never--I mean,

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
acting and modeling, really.

34:52.999 --> 34:54.999
I'm not some--I mean, I'm not
trying to be an ass****,

34:54.999 --> 34:56.999
but, like--no, I wasn't
trying to put you down.

34:56.999 --> 34:57.999
- I'm sorry, but I've been
pursuing my sh**

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
since I was, like, hmm, seven.

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
You decided that sh**
when you were, like, what, 25?

35:01.999 --> 35:04.999
- No, baby, I wasn't--
- So shut up about that.

35:04.999 --> 35:05.999
- No, no, I'm just saying--
- That was a really hard dream

35:06.000 --> 35:07.999
for me to give up.

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
It's not about
what my f***ing resume says.

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
It's not about
what modeling jobs

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
I did or what
acting gigs I booked.

35:14.999 --> 35:16.999
I want Tom to get it
into his head now

35:16.999 --> 35:18.999
that he is capable
of so much more

35:18.999 --> 35:19.999
than what he's doing now.

35:19.999 --> 35:20.999
It's a f***ing pipe dream.

35:20.999 --> 35:22.999
You don't want to be
40-year-old out-of-work actor.

35:22.999 --> 35:25.999
- No, I don't.
I don't, bub, I don't.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
- That's not cute,
and it's not cute to me.

35:27.999 --> 35:29.999
- Yeah.
- So get a f***ing job.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.999
- Can we go to bed after this?
- Yes, let's go.

35:40.999 --> 35:42.999
- Okay, so, the word
on the street

35:42.999 --> 35:46.999
is that you may be doing
a little upgrade in this.

35:46.999 --> 35:48.999
- Yeah, I might be.

35:49.999 --> 35:51.999
- My doctor, John, which--

35:51.999 --> 35:53.999
he really discounted
heavily on my nose.

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
If he heavily discounts it,
I told her I'd take care of it.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.999
Brittany really
wanted this surgery,

35:57.999 --> 35:59.999
and I happen to be really
good friends with a doctor.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.999
Brittany's, you know,
put up so much

36:01.999 --> 36:03.000
with this whole
sunglass thing,

36:03.000 --> 36:04.999
standing by my side, so...

36:04.999 --> 36:06.999
like, this was a nice gift
that I can give her.

36:06.999 --> 36:07.999
- Jax is so excited

36:07.999 --> 36:09.999
about "massaging"
my boobs afterwards.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.999
- Like, you know, this.
- Oh, yeah,

36:11.999 --> 36:13.999
'cause you have
to massage the, uh...

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
- Put my face.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
Like, I want the teardrop.
I want the actual breasts.

36:17.999 --> 36:20.999
I don't want porn star circles.

36:20.999 --> 36:21.999
- You know what?
I think I figured it out.

36:21.999 --> 36:24.999
Jax should be dating maybe
like a mound of clay,

36:24.999 --> 36:27.999
where can mold
all of her opinions

36:27.999 --> 36:29.999
and thoughts and boobies
the way he wants.

36:29.999 --> 36:31.999
But he's not.
He's dating Brittany.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.999
- Whoo! Boobs in my face.

36:34.999 --> 36:35.999
Love 'em. Ahh!

36:37.999 --> 36:38.999
I love boobs.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.999
- I just wanted to
thank everybody,

36:52.999 --> 36:55.999
especially Pump and Lisa,
for having us,

36:55.999 --> 36:57.999
and also, I'm really,
really happy

36:57.999 --> 36:59.999
that we'll just be able to
marry the one that you love.

36:59.999 --> 37:01.999
- Ow!
- Thank you.

37:01.999 --> 37:05.999
- Congratulations!

37:21.999 --> 37:23.999
- I'm really annoyed.
- Why? Schwartz?

37:23.999 --> 37:25.999
- Yes.
- What'd he do?

37:25.999 --> 37:27.000
- For starters, you know

37:27.999 --> 37:28.999
how he was gonna do
the sangria stuff with Tom.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.999
He quit before
he actually started.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.999
I mean, maybe I wouldn't
be as annoyed with him

37:33.999 --> 37:37.999
if he didn't just also
extend the invitation to Stassi

37:37.999 --> 37:40.999
to our engagement party.

37:40.999 --> 37:43.999
- He invited her...
- To our engagement party.

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
- How are you not more mad?
I would be so pissed.

37:45.999 --> 37:47.999
- No, trust me.
I just had a day and a half,

37:47.999 --> 37:51.999
just, like, being--wanting
to smack him silly, but--

37:51.999 --> 37:53.999
- That was, like, the biggest
mistake he could have made.

37:53.999 --> 37:54.999
- I haven't even
talked to her.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.999
I don't even know
if I want to talk to her.

37:56.999 --> 37:58.999
I just don't understand
what changed.

37:58.999 --> 38:02.999
Like, how she was able to
turn you guys both around.

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
I just know how f***ing
manipulating she can be.

38:04.999 --> 38:07.999
I feel like she's a sniper
just picking them all off.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.999
- Listen, I need my girl
to be drunk right now.

38:09.999 --> 38:10.999
She's going to meet
John Layke in the morning.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.999
- Wait, how big
are you gonna go?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
- She's getting triple Ds.
- A full C, small D.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.999
- I'm not being appropriate,

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
but we discussed
we like Sarah's.

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
Brittany and I were kind
of looking at pictures

38:20.999 --> 38:22.999
of what she wanted
to go on for her chest,

38:22.999 --> 38:26.999
so I just so happened
to acknowledge

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
Peter's girlfriend's boobs,

38:28.999 --> 38:30.999
like, "Well, these are nice."

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
Heck, she should be
a boob model.

38:32.999 --> 38:33.999
- Okay, so hers are
way bigger than--

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
- Hers are double Ds.

38:35.999 --> 38:36.999
- If I'm
gonna help finance this,

38:36.999 --> 38:39.999
I want 'em how I want 'em.

38:39.999 --> 38:41.999
Listen, I don't want
porn star boobs.

38:41.999 --> 38:42.999
I don't like that.

38:42.999 --> 38:45.999
Natural teardrop naturalness.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.999
- It's not
what you want, though.

38:47.999 --> 38:48.999
She's not your paper doll...
- But we're on the same page.

38:48.999 --> 38:50.999
- That you're gonna pick out
what boobs she wants.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.999
- Right?
- Jax, it's also her body.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.999
- I'm not gonna pay
for something that I don't like.

38:55.999 --> 38:56.999
Nope. Not.

38:56.999 --> 38:58.999
- If anyone said,
"I'm not gonna pay for something

38:58.999 --> 39:00.000
I don't want,"
I would immediately be like,

39:00.999 --> 39:01.999
"Okay, well,
then no, thank you."

39:01.999 --> 39:02.999
- I apologize.
I'm sorry.

39:02.999 --> 39:03.999
I didn't mean
to say it like that.

39:03.999 --> 39:05.999
- I'm just putting you
in check, dude,

39:05.999 --> 39:06.999
because that was f***ing weird.
- That was a mistake.

39:06.999 --> 39:08.999
I didn't mean
to, like, get crazy.

39:08.999 --> 39:10.999
- Jax has been
acting kind of weird

39:10.999 --> 39:12.999
the past few days,
and I don't know what it is.

39:12.999 --> 39:13.999
I don't know if it's Brittany.

39:13.999 --> 39:14.999
I don't know
if it's the arrest.

39:14.999 --> 39:16.999
I'm not sure what it is,

39:16.999 --> 39:18.999
but he's definitely
acting strange.

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.999
- I mean, I know Lisa
was giving you sh**.

39:35.999 --> 39:36.999
I know Katie
was giving you sh**.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.999
- I know that I flaked
on this whole sangria thing,

39:39.999 --> 39:40.999
and it's kind of a bad look,
but they're,

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
like, taking this
and they're extrapolating.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.999
- Everything's gonna be fine.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
- And she's like, "Are you
gonna do this with every job?"

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
And Lisa's like, "Are you gonna
do this with every job?"

39:48.999 --> 39:50.999
Like, "You got to get
your sh** together."

39:50.999 --> 39:53.999
Are you rubbing it in my face?

39:53.999 --> 39:55.999
- So you're gonna rep
our company.

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
- You talked to Pandora,
didn't you?

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
- Here you go. What are you
talking about over here?

39:58.999 --> 40:01.999
- I'm just, you know--Schwartz
is going through some sh**,

40:01.999 --> 40:02.999
which, by the way, I know
you're inviting Stassi

40:02.999 --> 40:05.999
to the engagement party
and stuff.

40:05.999 --> 40:06.999
- Dude, what the f***, man?

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
We could go--we're
all in agreement

40:08.999 --> 40:09.999
that we're not
gonna talk to her,

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
and now you guys
are falling one by one.

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
- I'm not falling.
- She's got--she knows how to--

40:13.999 --> 40:15.999
- She's got tact; she went
to the weakest people first.

40:15.999 --> 40:16.999
- She does, you're right.
- Kristen and you.

40:16.999 --> 40:17.999
- However--

40:19.999 --> 40:21.999
- I was so hard on her.

40:21.999 --> 40:22.999
Like, making someone cry,
like, I was like,

40:22.999 --> 40:24.999
"f***,
what have I done?" inside.

40:24.999 --> 40:26.999
- It's not just you.
You think for Katie too, dude,

40:26.999 --> 40:28.999
and this--Katie has got
such a,

40:28.999 --> 40:30.999
like, a grudge against Stassi
right now, it's like--

40:30.999 --> 40:31.999
- Take it down,
like, five notches.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
- Come on, now.

40:33.999 --> 40:34.999
- He's had a f***ing
rough night, man.

40:34.999 --> 40:35.999
- So you invited her
to your engagement party

40:35.999 --> 40:36.999
without telling Katie.

40:36.999 --> 40:37.999
- I appreciate your concern,

40:37.999 --> 40:38.999
but I have it under control.

40:38.999 --> 40:39.999
- She's manipulating you.
- No, no, no.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.999
She did not manipulate me.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
- You honestly got to stop
being such a f***ing pussy.

40:43.999 --> 40:45.999
- I'm not a ****--

40:45.999 --> 40:46.999
- Because--yes, you are--
- I'm not a f***ing pussy.

40:46.999 --> 40:47.999
- Even--clearly Stassi
knows it too,

40:47.999 --> 40:48.999
'cause she knew
to go to you first.

40:48.999 --> 40:49.999
- Please, please, dude,

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
just stop, man.
He's had a--dude.

40:51.999 --> 40:52.999
- No, no, no.
You're a weak link.

40:52.999 --> 40:54.999
- Dude, I'm sorry--I--
- Dude, I'm right on this.

40:54.999 --> 40:55.999
- I hear what you're saying.

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
- It was his choice
to go meet with Stassi.

40:56.999 --> 40:57.999
- It's like, dude,
if you got drunk and,

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999
like, you and Shay
wrecked a car

40:59.999 --> 41:01.999
and he broke his leg and,
like, all of a sudden, like,

41:01.999 --> 41:02.999
"I want to talk about my band"

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
or something. It's like,
dude, that's f***ed up.

41:04.999 --> 41:07.000
- Shut the f***
up about your f***ing band.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.999
- No, dude, it's not about that.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.999
He's just had a f***ing
rough day, man.

41:10.999 --> 41:12.999
Like, dude, just be
his f***ing friend, man.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.000
- I am being his friend--I was
just saying, this is what--

41:14.000 --> 41:15.999
- All right, I'm out.
I got to walk it off.

41:15.999 --> 41:16.999
You guys figure it out.

41:19.999 --> 41:20.999
- Dude, stop acting like
you're the number one

41:20.999 --> 41:24.999
f***ing guy in this group, man.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
I'm the number one guy
in this group.

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
- Are you f***ing
kidding me, Jax?

41:28.999 --> 41:30.999
f*** you, ****.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.999
You don't get to decide
that your ego is just gonna try

41:32.999 --> 41:35.999
and pull f***ing rank
on me or something.

41:35.999 --> 41:38.999
Dude, there's other people
here besides you, man.

41:38.999 --> 41:39.999
- I know that.
- Like, Schwartz has had

41:39.999 --> 41:40.999
a f***ing tough day too.

41:40.999 --> 41:41.999
- Oh, my God,
he's had a tough day.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.999
- Okay, so, fine, fine--

41:43.999 --> 41:44.999
- He's not going
under the knife.

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
My girlfriend's in there talking
about going into surgery.

41:46.999 --> 41:48.000
- Okay, fine, so
Brittany's getting a boob job.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.999
Schwartz is constantly
getting f***ing castrated.

41:50.999 --> 41:51.999
- He's a big boy.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
- And all you can--
- He can handle it.

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
- This is f***ed up,
you say some sh** like that.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
- You know, Tom Sandoval
sometimes can just piss me off,

41:58.999 --> 42:00.999
because he thinks, like,
he's the team captain,

42:00.999 --> 42:03.999
like he knows best,
and his word means everything.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
- This isn't all about you, man.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.000
This is f***ed up, dude.
- Dude, I didn't say it was--

42:07.999 --> 42:08.999
- I'm gonna
forget you f***ing said that.

42:08.999 --> 42:09.999
- Dude, don't--

42:09.999 --> 42:10.999
- Don't sit there
and say sh** like that to me.

42:10.999 --> 42:12.999
That's f***ed up, man.

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
- Stop trying to hold his hand.
Let him do his own battles.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
You know, Sandoval
really has no right

42:16.999 --> 42:18.999
to get pissed with me,
because I'm saying

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
what's on my mind,
and I do tell the truth.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
People just don't want
to hear it.

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:27.999 --> 42:30.999
- We're here.
Throw some Ds on that bitch.

42:30.999 --> 42:32.999
- Think they both
will be happy.

42:32.999 --> 42:33.999
- Good, good, good, good, good.

42:33.999 --> 42:36.999
- Ow. Ow. ****.

42:36.999 --> 42:37.999
- You can see my nipples.

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
Inviting me lingerie shopping

42:41.999 --> 42:44.999
is Scheana sweeping our issues
under the rug.

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
How is this sexy?
It's f***ing horrible.

42:49.999 --> 42:52.999
- You turned up loaded.
- Kristen showed up too.

42:52.999 --> 42:53.999
- You said.
"You're not talented.

42:53.999 --> 42:56.999
I'm above you.
I'm James Kennedy."

42:56.999 --> 42:59.999
- Go away and grow the f*** up.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
- Like go f*** yourself.
- Okay.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.999
- I feel like I'm not accepted
if I'm not talked about.

43:03.999 --> 43:05.999
But at 36, I mean,
can I change?

43:05.999 --> 43:07.999
- I f***ing take care
of all my friends,

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
and you guys f***ing
talk sh** about me

43:09.999 --> 43:12.999
like I'm a backstabbing
selfish piece of sh**.

43:12.999 --> 43:14.999
- To see
more of "Vanderpump Rules,"

43:14.999 --> 43:16.000
