10:28.520 --> 10:30.163
maybe at a garage.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.446

10:32.868 --> 10:34.026
It sounds good.

10:36.194 --> 10:37.360

[LAUGHS] Oh, Jughead.

Look,

10:41.717 --> 10:44.718
your dad has got a sweet gig now.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.504
You've got a house
with rooms for everyone.

10:47.506 --> 10:50.055
I'm looking at this whole
thing like a do-over,

10:50.058 --> 10:52.063
a chance to be a real family.

10:53.136 --> 10:54.453
That's all I want.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.216
Oh, no, that's not true.
There is one more thing.

11:01.219 --> 11:03.645
It's, uh, your dad's 50th,

11:03.647 --> 11:07.059
and I've decided to throw him a
little soiree at the speakeasy,

11:07.062 --> 11:11.731

you gave the birthday speech.

[SHERIFF KELLER] Well, thanks,
FP, that's quite an introduction.

11:52.652 --> 11:55.146
Um, a lot of what we'll be doing
over the next couple of months

11:55.148 --> 11:56.680
will be like basic training.

an officer who will then mentor them.

12:13.621 --> 12:16.483
that at 50 you'd be sitting in the
driver's seat of a sheriff's cruiser?

12:16.486 --> 12:19.312
No, I never even imagined
I'd make it to 50.

12:19.314 --> 12:22.298
Figured that was my expiration date.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.300
What did you think was gonna happen?

12:26.596 --> 12:29.856
Getting myself killed or drinking
myself to death, like my old man.

12:29.858 --> 12:32.059

12:32.062 --> 12:33.821

[FP] Yeah, but I've
heard rumblings and rumors

13:44.081 --> 13:46.406
that someone's looking
to reopen the candy store.

Well, he's nothing if not thorough.

15:05.906 --> 15:09.757
Okay, so that means there could be
as many as ten cards still in play,

figure out how to track them

16:05.932 --> 16:08.714
One of his disciples delivered
the Quest Card for him.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.002
He wore a mask.

16:10.005 --> 16:11.229
Didn't say much.

16:16.146 --> 16:17.321
No one in this room.

[JUGHEAD] Well, whoever
does have the card,

16:19.162 --> 16:21.162
why haven't they made a play
against the Red Paladin yet?

16:21.164 --> 16:23.741
The Red Paladin is an advanced quest.

16:23.744 --> 16:26.085
It takes time to
adequately prepare for it.

16:26.088 --> 16:27.482
But they'll act on it.

16:27.485 --> 16:30.865
And sooner or later, they'll
come for you, Red Paladin.

16:34.335 --> 16:37.511
How are things with you and
Jughead now that his mom's back?

16:37.513 --> 16:39.090
Good.

16:39.093 --> 16:42.779
He told me I could stay in the
house with them in my old room,

16:42.782 --> 16:45.849
which feels just weird to me.

16:45.852 --> 16:49.097
But, I mean, I guess I'd get to
know his mom and sister better.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.127

to tell you about Mrs. Jones.

16:54.563 --> 16:55.771
What?

16:55.773 --> 16:57.052
She swore me to secrecy,

16:57.055 --> 17:01.777
but I can't have you getting caught
up in this, not even by association.

17:01.779 --> 17:03.518
Caught up in what, Vee?

17:03.521 --> 17:06.434
I have insider information that

17:06.436 --> 17:11.622
Gladys Jones is taking over
the drug trade in Riverdale.

17:12.685 --> 17:14.435
What, like Fizzle Rocks?

17:14.438 --> 17:16.012
I thought all that stuff was gone now?

17:16.015 --> 17:17.398
It was.

17:17.402 --> 17:21.092
But like Gloria Swanson, it's
getting ready for a comeback,

17:21.095 --> 17:24.287
with Gladys leading the
charge instead of my father.

17:24.290 --> 17:26.903
Vee, you need to tell me everything.

17:30.225 --> 17:32.764
And then I have to tell Jughead.

17:44.125 --> 17:45.990
It's a weird feeling,

17:45.993 --> 17:47.689
knowing that there are all these people,

17:47.692 --> 17:49.440
strangers out there who want to kill me.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.345
It's the game. It makes people crazy.

17:52.347 --> 17:56.171
You know, as a matter of fact, those
hardcore gamers are so obsessive,

17:56.174 --> 17:59.018
any message they receive from the
Gargoyle King they take as gospel.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.261
Maybe we can harness that.

18:00.263 --> 18:02.096
Like when I became the Gryphon Queen.

18:02.098 --> 18:04.856
Right. Now, we know that the
only way to complete Hiram's quest

18:04.859 --> 18:06.784
is to kill the Red Paladin.

18:06.787 --> 18:10.530
But who says the Gargoyle King
can't add to his own quest,

18:10.533 --> 18:12.044
offer a different outcome?

18:14.377 --> 18:16.752
Do you guys remember when
we were in elementary school,

18:16.754 --> 18:18.888
and it was snowing,
and we played that game,

18:18.890 --> 18:20.114
uh, king of the mountain?

18:20.117 --> 18:21.849
- Yeah, kind of.
- Not really, no.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.302
Well, you won every time, Archie,
so we can play to your strengths.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.142
I'll write an addendum to the quest

18:27.145 --> 18:28.768
that says the Red Paladin

18:28.769 --> 18:31.930
will defend his mountaintop
for 12 hours, dusk till dawn.

18:31.933 --> 18:35.459
Anyone that has this "Kill the Red
Paladin" card can try and take you down,

18:35.462 --> 18:37.494
but if they don't by the
time the challenge ends,

18:37.497 --> 18:38.991
your mark of sacrifice is lifted.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.461
- Let's do it.
- Okay, well, if we're gonna do that,

18:41.463 --> 18:45.864
no weapons, hand-to-hand combat
only, only one challenger at a time.

18:45.866 --> 18:48.283
Perfect. But we're
still gonna need a space.

18:48.285 --> 18:50.490
A mountaintop that's going to
increase your chances of winning.

18:50.492 --> 18:52.751

who can help provide that.

38:04.065 --> 38:05.815
I need to focus my rage,

38:05.817 --> 38:09.108
therefore this year's
musical is <i> Heathers.</i>

38:09.111 --> 38:10.318
You're directing,

38:10.321 --> 38:12.154
I'm playing HBIC Heather Chandler.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.656
Any questions?

38:13.658 --> 38:15.161
I thought not. Okay, bye.

[PEOPLE APPLAUDING]

38:20.504 --> 38:23.764
Thank you, everyone, for coming out to

38:23.767 --> 38:27.211
celebrate one of Riverdale's finest.

38:27.213 --> 38:30.056
- The finest, if you ask me.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.106
My husband, FP Jones.

- [APPLAUSE]
- [CHUCKLES]

38:34.220 --> 38:35.821
Once, he was a king,

38:35.823 --> 38:37.160
a great king.

38:37.991 --> 38:40.191
Maybe the best ever.

38:40.193 --> 38:45.089
But I think the greatest
role that he's ever held

38:45.092 --> 38:47.114
is that of father.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.358
So, why don't we ask Jughead

38:49.360 --> 38:51.452
to come on up here and say a few words.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.924
What do you say, guys?

38:52.927 --> 38:56.111
Do you have any idea
what you're going to say?

38:56.114 --> 38:58.343
- [ALL CHANTING] Jug! Jug! Jug!
- I have no clue.

38:58.345 --> 39:00.387
[GLADYS] Jug! Jug! Jug!

39:12.675 --> 39:14.194

Thanks, I...

39:30.878 --> 39:34.237
It's no secret that the Jones men
don't really like birthday parties.

[SIGHS]

39:35.624 --> 39:37.802
We're a rather broody bunch.

39:37.805 --> 39:39.473
[ALL LAUGH]

39:39.476 --> 39:42.078
You know, I remember when you made
me promise not to stop writing.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.572
Not for anything.

39:43.575 --> 39:44.811
And I haven't.

39:45.725 --> 39:47.582
I've written every day.

39:47.585 --> 39:51.879
But I could punch keys every
night in a booth at Pop's

39:51.881 --> 39:55.383
and never come up with a story
nearly as remarkable as yours.

39:55.385 --> 39:57.847
You've gone from the wrong
the side of the tracks

39:57.848 --> 39:59.427
to the right side of the law.

39:59.430 --> 40:03.057
From Serpent king to
sheriff of Riverdale.

40:03.059 --> 40:06.042
From a man that most people in this town

40:06.045 --> 40:08.113
had probably written off...

40:10.441 --> 40:12.401
to someone that righted his wrongs

40:14.237 --> 40:16.277
and brought our family back together.

40:18.074 --> 40:19.799
That's who you are to me,

40:22.003 --> 40:24.338
someone that would do
anything for his family.

40:34.590 --> 40:36.910
There's something you need
to know about this family.

40:42.932 --> 40:45.384
We'll always be there for you.

40:45.387 --> 40:47.117
Me

40:47.120 --> 40:49.014
And Jellybean and Mom.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.115
I'm proud to be your son.

40:55.135 --> 40:56.839
I'm proud to share your name.

40:59.132 --> 41:01.647
And I am proud

41:01.650 --> 41:03.872
to be part of your

41:03.875 --> 41:05.828
amazing story.

41:08.872 --> 41:10.222
Here's to 50, Dad.

41:12.692 --> 41:13.840
And to 50 more.

41:33.074 --> 41:35.575
That was a beautiful speech, Jug.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.002
Thanks.

41:37.004 --> 41:38.344
Most of it was true.

41:40.982 --> 41:43.644
[SIGHS] What are you gonna do now?

41:45.960 --> 41:50.207
Save Jellybean, protect my
dad, and run my mom out of town.

41:50.210 --> 41:51.775
Do you want to help?
