WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:03.504
All right, girls, in order to
start winning more games,

00:03.504 --> 00:05.339
we gotta start scoring
more points.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.132
How can we score
more points, sir?

00:07.132 --> 00:10.678
Three pointers! We're gonna
work on our three point shot.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.263
Which a lot of teams
at your age don't have.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.600
So from where you're standing,
that is worth three points.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.061
Everybody, I'll feed the balls
back. Let's see what you got.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.568
Watch this,, sir!
I can get it in.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.070
Okay, get it in Lucy.

00:29.070 --> 00:33.033
Nice! That was a good one.
Wasn't it?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.702
-[girls giggle]
-That was close.

00:34.702 --> 00:38.998
Layups. Let's go back to just
trying to make layups.

00:38.998 --> 00:40.875
Two lines.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.418
♪ I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie ♪

00:43.418 --> 00:46.171
♪ I'm awesome
I'm driving around
in my mom's ride ♪

00:46.171 --> 00:49.216
♪ I'm awesome
A quarter of my life gone by ♪

00:51.092 --> 00:53.971
♪ I'm awesome ♪

00:59.267 --> 01:02.145
She's so cute. I like Rachel,
I really do.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.773
-She's so cute.
-I think I'm just gonna
ask her out. Enough.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.318
Uh, you should know, she
and I had a bit of a moment...

01:08.318 --> 01:10.529
-the other night after closing.
-What do you mean "a moment"?

01:10.529 --> 01:13.657
Well, like, we were just
talking and then our mouths,

01:13.657 --> 01:16.577
kind of slowly high-fived.
For a while.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.038
Why do you do that?
You cut my grass.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.582
I say I like someone, you back
off. That's what friends do.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.125
Sorry man, I just...
You were taking a long time.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.712
There's no time frame.
Your friend says the like
someone, you back off.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.339
This is my hunting ground.
This is what I do, man.

01:29.339 --> 01:33.134
You have your own hunting
ground, man. School. Hot moms.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.512
That Scottish lady. You got
all the other teachers, Lisa.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.180
-I don't want Lisa.
-[Bill] She's so hot!

01:37.180 --> 01:39.182
-I don't want Lisa.
-Is it cool if I take
a run at her?

01:39.182 --> 01:40.851
Why wouldn't you
take a run at that?

01:40.851 --> 01:43.854
-You take a run at everything.
-Right.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.527
Mr. Stratton, you have a book
that's 30 days overdue.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.906
You are a disgrace to the human
race. Books are knowl...

01:53.906 --> 01:56.491
Whatever, sir. You'll get it
when you get it, all right?

01:58.201 --> 02:00.037
You will get me my book.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.122
[Robert] Mr. Leung!

02:02.122 --> 02:05.542
-Mr. Stratton, run along.
-Yes, you're dismissed.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.920
Mr. Leung, what on earth
are you doing?

02:07.920 --> 02:11.548
-My job.
-You can't grab a student.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.634
I'm just enforcing discipline.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.344
If you're having discipline
issues, you will send the
students to me.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.305
Do I make myself clear?

02:18.305 --> 02:20.390
-Crystal.
-[Robert] Good.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.149
[Bobbi] Yes, he's an
interesting guy and it's...

02:29.149 --> 02:31.276
-Hey Gerry!
-Hey Bobbi.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.361
Have you met my
boyfriend, Craig?

02:33.361 --> 02:36.740
-Oh, this is your
boyfriend, Craig.
-I wish.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.451
Okay, I'm going to see you
in my office in about five
minutes Mr. Lundy.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.620
-Okay, thanks Ms. Galka.
-Okay.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.747
-This is Craig.
-Shut up!

02:43.747 --> 02:45.206
Hey man, heard a lot about you.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.667
You guys aren't playing
a joke on me right now?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.127
-That's Craig?
-Yup, that's Craig.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.336
That's your boyfriend
of all these...?

02:49.336 --> 02:50.671
-That's my boyfriend.
-Okay, oh.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.297
Just here to pick up Bobbi.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.800
And you're super early,
as usual, right?

02:54.800 --> 02:57.427
And you knew I had a meeting
right? Yes you did. Yeah ya did.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.471
So, you're going to
have to wait for, like,
an hour now,

02:59.471 --> 03:00.889
-'cause I gotta go.
-Yeah, no problem.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.390
You guys gonna break
up again right now?

03:02.390 --> 03:05.894
-I hope not.
-You know what?
You're here anyway,

03:05.894 --> 03:08.480
why don't you just go help Gerry
with his basketball practice
or something?

03:08.480 --> 03:11.399
It's okay, he used to play ball
in college so he'll be fine.

03:11.399 --> 03:14.736
Okay, yeah. I'm sure
the girls would love that,
if you're up for it.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.781
-Not a problem, let's do it.
-Okay, just meet me
in the car in one hour.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.826
-Yeah, no problem sweetie,
I'll be there in 55 minutes.
-Okay, don't be late. Okay.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.620
-Love you.
-I love you, too.

03:23.620 --> 03:28.876
There she goes, Miss America.
You got mirrors at home? No. Um.

03:28.876 --> 03:33.130
-I'm not following.
-Here's Bobbi, here's Bobbi,
follow me.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.466
-Okay.
-Here's Bobbi,
there's a guy like me.

03:36.466 --> 03:40.303
-Yeah.
-And there's a guy like you, see
that? You're another level.

03:40.303 --> 03:44.099
-So you need a girl where...umm.
-I'm not...

03:44.099 --> 03:46.060
-It's just...it's...
-What do you mean?

03:46.060 --> 03:49.563
A lot of people would see
this, like I did and go:

03:49.563 --> 03:53.942
-What is this? Is she paying?
-What?

03:53.942 --> 03:57.946
Well, it's, umm...
Bobbi's a great girl. Wow.

03:57.946 --> 04:02.534
She's pretty. But then
there's another level that...

04:02.534 --> 04:05.787
Uh....
Okay.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.041
-Yeah.
-See even that's like a...

04:11.376 --> 04:13.003
[Jimmy] Hey, Mr. Hunt.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.713
Can we ask one last question
about our crop?

04:14.713 --> 04:16.798
Sure Jimmy, of course.
What's up?

04:16.798 --> 04:19.384
-Okay, do we have to adjust
the Ph level in the soil

04:19.384 --> 04:20.594
when we harvest the wheatgrass?

04:20.594 --> 04:21.970
No, nothing need change
at harvest.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.847
Okay, that's perfect.
Thanks for the help.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.682
I'm just glad that you're
taking such a keen interest
in science.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.727
-Science is awesome.
-Science IS awesome.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.688
-Good luck with your wheatgrass.
-Thanks, sir.

04:31.688 --> 04:37.611
You grow that wheatgrass.
I'll continue to fertilize
young minds.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.363
-Thanks for helping out, sir.
-[Craig] No problem,
good job girls.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.200
-They're terrible, right?
-Yeah, they're awful.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.953
Actually painful to watch.
I think I got worse just
being around them.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.038
-[Girls] He's so cute.
-[Gerry] Don't I know.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.457
-Want to play some one on one?
-Yeah!

04:52.626 --> 04:55.754
-It's hot.
-[Gerry] Yeah, it's...

04:57.172 --> 05:00.134
You look hot.
Take your shirt off.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.302
Nope. I'm good.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.097
You look like you're dying
of heat. You look hot.

05:05.097 --> 05:08.183
No, I feel... I feel a breeze.

05:08.183 --> 05:11.645
I sweat a little bit, sometimes.
But...

05:11.645 --> 05:14.397
I gotta breeze, I think that's
a breeze on my side.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.650
-Craig! Good to
see you again, bro.
-Hey man, yeah, how's it going?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.693
-[Dwyer] Gerry, I'll see
you tomorrow.
-Yeah.

05:18.693 --> 05:22.197
Remember, inspiring minds,
it's a beautiful thing.

05:22.197 --> 05:26.534
Man, is it just me?
Or is he so fake?

05:26.534 --> 05:29.204
Thank you! I've been telling
people that. Thank you!

05:29.204 --> 05:31.748
Yeah, like, everyone loves him.
I just don't get it.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.709
Forget the one on one.
Let's go for a drink.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.588
Yeah, I'm down for that.
Let me just text Bobbi
and ask her.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.674
Really? You have to ask Bobbi?

05:40.674 --> 05:43.510
Yeah, man. I don't want her
to break up with me again.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.679
I don't ever want
to lose her, so.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.307
Why?

05:48.307 --> 05:52.019
-Ahhh! Good one, good one.
-Yeah, I was kidding.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.479
-Mr. Cheeley?
-Mr. Leung.

05:54.479 --> 05:58.317
I have Mr. Roberts here.
He was caught defacing one
of our sacred books.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.278
Oh, dear.
Mr. Roberts, have a seat.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.948
Thank you Mr. Leung,
for listening to me
and letting me do my job.

06:04.948 --> 06:08.493
-Of course.
-So, Mr. Roberts...

06:08.493 --> 06:11.496
Mr. Cheeley, I have
Mr. Stratton here.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.875
-He still hasn't returned
his library book.
-I didn't have any time.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.795
Shut your face.
Sorry, it's a bad habit.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.048
Mr. Stratton, have a seat.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.508
Mr. Cheeley, I have
Ms. Tilboy here.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.426
She was caught crying
in the library.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.595
I also have Mr. Roberts,
the older brother,

06:27.595 --> 06:29.764
he was caught sleeping
in the library.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.726
I have Ms. Western, she was
caught eating in the library.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.103
This young lady was swearing
in the library.

06:35.103 --> 06:39.274
This gentleman here was playing
some sort of Pokemon.

06:39.274 --> 06:42.903
-Thank you Mr. Leung.
-Discipline.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.078
[music playing in bar]

06:51.078 --> 06:52.495
I wouldn't say I'm a
good golfer, but I love playing.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.122
I love to play too,
we should play.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.374
Yeah, let's do it.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.292
What are the odds
we both love golf too?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.543
What are the odds
two white guys

06:58.543 --> 07:02.172
-in collared shirts love golf?
-Okay.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.258
You know Bill, they say sarcasm
is the lowest form of wit.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.885
Yeah. That's what they say.
Thank you.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.763
Hey, can I get you something?
Like a drink or my phone number?

07:09.763 --> 07:14.142
No, but can you
get me his number?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.977
Oh, me? Sorry, I'm taken.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.147
But my buddy
Gerry here is single.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.566
-Hello.
-[whispers] That's what
buddies do.

07:21.566 --> 07:26.446
-Hey, what's your name?
-I'm sorry, I'm not interested,
thanks.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.489
I don't know, I think she
got a call or something.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.742
Don't worry about her. Man,
you're too good for her anyway.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.412
-[Gerry] Let's drink!
-[Bobbi] Hey guys.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.997
-Hi Bobbi.
-She wanted to come,
I hope that's okay.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.583
-Excuse me.
-Yes, this is weird.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.128
- Whoa, beers, hey?
How many is that?
-Yeah.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.754
-It's only my second.
-Of many.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.840
-Yeah!
-Or last one.
Baby, right?

07:45.840 --> 07:47.801
-Yeah.
-Yeah, okay.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.678
Fun! Honey, what are you doing?

07:50.678 --> 07:52.639
French fries?
Remember how we talked?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.224
About how you're gonna
start eating better.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.310
-Huh? And you promised me?
-Yeah, you're right.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.770
-Have a French fry, one, one!
-No, no, no! No!

07:58.770 --> 08:00.730
Let him have one
French fry, Bobbi! Let him.

08:00.730 --> 08:05.026
-No! No! No! Drop it!
-Don't drop it! Gross!

08:09.323 --> 08:12.409
-Hey man. What's goin' on?
-What are you doing up so early?

08:12.409 --> 08:15.162
-Early bird gets the Gerry.
-What?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.622
I just thought we could talk.
I haven't see you for awhile.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.625
-Okay, let's talk.
-Uh, we still on for Friday?

08:20.625 --> 08:24.171
I got these two hotties
who are up for some drinks!

08:24.171 --> 08:27.048
-It'll be good man,
you get first choice.
-I'm going to dinner with Craig.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.384
He got us into Chez Sans Sans.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.761
Yeah, that's cool.
Maybe I'll come with.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.305
All hang out,
make it a guys night.

08:33.305 --> 08:34.973
It's pretty hard to get in
to Chez Sans Sans,

08:34.973 --> 08:37.600
so we only got two,
two of us.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.727
If you got three, then
where are you sitting.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.521
Oh yeah, a triangle
would never work.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.440
I can't come for
configuration reasons?

08:43.440 --> 08:47.152
It's just, it's crowded.
It's a hard restaurant
to get in to.

08:47.152 --> 08:50.447
And we'd probably have a table
and you're going to...

08:50.447 --> 08:52.699
Sounds romantic, you guys have
a nice little candlelit dinner.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.160
And white napkins,
no that's fine.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.704
-Next week... maybe.
-You're blowing me off,
is that what's going on here?

08:57.704 --> 09:01.624
See, Craig doesn't do that.
Make me feel this big,
he brings me up.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.543
When I'm with Craig I feel up.
I feel lifted.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.628
-Really?
-That's what he does,
that's what a friend does.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.922
That's a beautiful sentiment.
You enjoying being
the third wheel

09:07.922 --> 09:09.632
-in Bobbi's relationship?
-Well, they break up a lot.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.592
So, soon, we'll
just be two wheels.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.388
Me and Craig.
And you will be the third wheel.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.348
So the wheel will be
on the other foot.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.525
Hello Trudy.

09:26.525 --> 09:29.027
You're a quick little bugger,
aren't you?

09:29.027 --> 09:32.906
So, what was Mr. Cheeley's
reaction to all the students
I brought him?

09:32.906 --> 09:36.368
Rage? Anger?

09:36.368 --> 09:38.328
Didn't seem to bother
him at all.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.705
I think you're gonna
have to take it up a notch.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.502
-Murder him.
-Maybe half a notch.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.629
You are truly helpful.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.675
-Cool, thanks Mr. Hunt.
-You're very welcome.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.389
What's old Jimmy boy saying?

09:57.389 --> 10:00.434
Oh, he and his friends
are working on a big
science project.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.977
-So I'm helping them out.
-Oh, Simon.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.896
They're growing wheatgrass.
Nutritional drink.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.774
They're starting a business.
Isn't that... Ahhh!

10:07.774 --> 10:09.150
-What?
-Are you an idiot?

10:09.150 --> 10:11.652
It's weed! He's growing weed!

10:11.652 --> 10:14.197
And you, a teacher,
are helping him.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.408
Wheatgrass. I know the codes
for weed. Mary Jane.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.993
-Listen, okay.
-...Blunts, dopes.

10:18.993 --> 10:23.540
Jimmy is an idiot. He is not
smart enough to grow weed alone.

10:23.540 --> 10:27.043
So he's getting a science
teacher and you don't even
see this?

10:27.043 --> 10:29.129
-He did say he'd
cut me in on the action.
-Thank you.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.215
-Right now you're an accomplice.
Keep leading him on.
-Okay.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.842
-Keep pretending you're into
this. Go along with it.
-[Simon] Okay.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.053
Because we're going to catch
him, and we're going to get
him expelled.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.139
-Yeah.
-I need you to go
on the other side.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.015
I need you to get inside
more on this.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.726
-[exhales] You flippin' me?
-I don't know what that means.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.854
I just need you to buy into,
pretend, tag them along.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.482
-'Cause I'll wear a wire.
-No.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.610
No wire. Something nice
and discreet on my chest.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.571
-Oh, boy.
-I don't want to shave my
chest hair though.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.657
-Okay, just keep
leading him on.
-'Cause it itches.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.659
[sighs]

11:01.328 --> 11:04.872
[yawning loudly]

11:04.872 --> 11:07.667
Late night for this guy.
Last night.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.670
Yup, I was out. Late.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.755
We're trying to get
our work done, sir.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.342
All right, let's take
attendance. Sheila.

11:15.342 --> 11:19.596
Jonathan.
Lori.

11:19.596 --> 11:23.642
Craig. Craig?
What?

11:23.642 --> 11:25.810
Sir, there's no Craig
in this class.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.686
Ohhh!

11:27.686 --> 11:31.065
Craig's my buddy
I was out with last night.

11:31.065 --> 11:35.111
What a guy.
How many of you have a friend?

11:35.111 --> 11:39.157
Okay, a really good
looking friend?

11:39.157 --> 11:42.869
Oh, no, guys, some of you are
friends. So that's not...

11:42.869 --> 11:48.124
How many of you have a friend
that could be a world class
model if they wanted?

11:48.124 --> 11:52.920
That's what I thought.
Jonathan! No you don't.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.631
You shouldn't even have had your
hand up the first question.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.467
My friend Carlo Baldessara
was a model for JC Penney.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.718
Yeah, my friend Craig could
sleep with JC...

11:59.718 --> 12:02.096
[class laughs]

12:03.097 --> 12:06.226
...Penney.
Back to work.

12:10.188 --> 12:14.775
-What on earth is going on here?
-Discipline is needed.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.696
Mr. Leung is just doing what
you asked him to do Robert.

12:17.696 --> 12:22.033
You're all dismissed.
Go on, go.

12:22.033 --> 12:26.621
Have a great day. Learn.
A little faster if you can.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.087
Mr. Leung, this has to stop.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.423
For some reason, Principal
Callaghan keeps you around here.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.133
But you have to learn
to respect my authority.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.845
No, you don't respect mine.
And your tie is ugly.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.805
Is it? Well, guess what.

12:44.805 --> 12:50.395
Melville Dewey of the Dewey
Decimal System was a fraud.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.314
-Your mother is a filthy...
-Hey, hey, hey, you two.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.775
-My mother is a saint.
-For money.

12:56.775 --> 12:58.986
Okay, that's enough.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.780
Robert, is it true that you
don't respect Wayne?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.617
I respect him fine.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.825
Wayne, how does
it make you feel

13:04.825 --> 13:06.494
to know that Robert
respects you?

13:06.494 --> 13:08.871
Warm, inside my body.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.666
All right, Wayne,
do you respect Robert?

13:11.666 --> 13:14.544
I don't not respect him.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.297
-Warm.
-[Trudy] Good.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.133
Okay, Robert, you say something
nice about Wayne.

13:20.133 --> 13:24.554
Mr. Leung, you rule the library
with an iron fist.

13:24.554 --> 13:28.475
-And I admire that. I do.
-Hmmm.

13:28.475 --> 13:33.104
-Leung?
-I like relish...

13:33.104 --> 13:36.483
...on my... toast.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.819
Jimmy DeGrazia
of Elkhorn Drive.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.322
-Hi, Mr. Hunt.
-Grade 12 student.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.740
-Yeah.
-At Xavier Academy.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.199
How are things coming
with the...?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.910
-Wheatgrass. What is that?
-Wheatgrass.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.121
Oh, it's a yearbook thing.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.831
-Hey guys, what's, ah, what?
-Hi.

13:52.831 --> 13:56.336
-Yeah, that sounds fun.
-What are you doing?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.837
Just thought I'd meet you here,
I knew you were gonna be here.

13:58.837 --> 14:02.216
So, I thought I'd swing by and
make sure that everything
went down smoothly.

14:02.216 --> 14:06.304
Jimmy, I found you a potential
buyer, you know Mr. Duncan.

14:06.304 --> 14:09.641
Heard you're starting a little
wheatgrass business, Jimmy.

14:09.641 --> 14:12.686
-Good for you.
-We don't have many customers
yet, but we're hoping.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.229
Yeah, well uh...
I heard that stuff's good
for you.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.607
So how about I
become your first customer?

14:17.607 --> 14:20.527
[Jimmy] Yeah?
That'd be awesome.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.612
Ah good, how about $300 worth?
Is that good?

14:22.612 --> 14:26.282
-That's great.
-So to confirm that figure is...

14:26.282 --> 14:28.326
-Three hundred dollars.
-Three hundred dollars.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.829
-Three hundred dollars.
-I'll have it tomorrow.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.540
-[Gerry] Yeah, that's great.
-[Jimmy] Wow.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.000
-Thanks again.
-You're welcome.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.253
-Nailed it.
-What are you doing? Why...?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.464
Don't worry, he thought
it was a yearbook thing.

14:41.464 --> 14:44.384
-I think you're taking
this too seriously.
-Don't pull me out now Gerry.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.721
I'm in too deep. I need
you now, and I need this.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.723
Do you know what guys like
DeGrazia do to guys like me?

14:54.268 --> 14:59.649
[Bobbi sings to herself]

14:59.649 --> 15:02.193
Hey Bobbi, can I
ask you something?

15:02.193 --> 15:05.321
-Yeah, go ahead.
-First of all, congrats
on Craig. What a great guy.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.157
Man, good looking,
athletic, funny, smart.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.536
He's everything you'd want
in a guy. How did you two...

15:11.536 --> 15:13.954
How did you guys meet? How'd
that happen? The two of you.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.123
Umm, I don't know.
You know we met, we clicked

15:16.123 --> 15:18.167
and then we're on again,
off again ever since.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.044
-He's perfect!
-[Bobbi] Yeah.

15:20.044 --> 15:24.758
But I gotta be honest, I don't
see what you bring to the table.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.510
Okay, that's not very nice.
Why would you...?

15:27.510 --> 15:29.303
I'm just saying, I mean I could
see if he got you pregnant.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.932
That would make sense,
why he stuck with you
all this time, but...

15:32.932 --> 15:37.228
I don't know, it's just a
mystery to me that he's
voluntarily stayed with you.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.355
-Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?
-No.

15:39.355 --> 15:42.483
-Because it's really...
-No, it's not. Okay.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.193
I didn't come to fight.
-Great.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.696
-I'd like to know if Craig
and I, just Craig and I,

15:46.696 --> 15:48.364
can go to the driving
range together?

15:48.364 --> 15:50.283
-Just the two of us.
-Actually, he can't make it now.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.744
-Why not?
-Because he went out
already once this week.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.662
And we feel like that is enough.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.330
Okay, I'll go with him next
week. How's that?

15:56.330 --> 15:58.625
Not available next week,
'cause we have a thing.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.753
I see what's going on.
This is about me thinking
he's better than you.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.338
No, we've spoken about this,
Craig and I.

16:04.338 --> 16:08.301
And we feel like he
can't start going out
all the time, with you.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.178
-Does Craig feel this way?
-Yeah.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.389
-Yeah, yeah he does.
-My Craig?

16:13.389 --> 16:17.017
He's my Craig. Okay? My Craig,
my boyfriend. Not yours.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.187
-Yeah, okay. He's our Craig.
-He's not our Craig, Gerry.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.566
Think about it.
I sleep with him. Do you?

16:25.109 --> 16:27.236
God.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.950
Malik and Gerry?
Drive the balls together?

16:31.950 --> 16:34.911
No Malik, I don't
want to drive balls.

16:44.044 --> 16:47.423
-You look sad Mr. D.
-I'm fine, Kira.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.384
If you want to talk,
I'm here for you.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.470
I'm your friend.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.515
Oh, look who it is,
Mr. Bobbi Galka.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.100
-Listen Gerry, I'm sorry
about all this.
-You should be.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.980
-[Kira] Yeah!
-Kira. Layups.

17:01.980 --> 17:06.359
-Mmmm, I don't like layups.
-Go do layups, thank you.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.277
I'm sorry I had to cancel
our golfing day.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.489
I guess mommy wouldn't
let you come out and play.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.658
-What's going on here?
-Are you kidding me right now?

17:13.658 --> 17:15.159
I was just going to see
if Craig could come out

17:15.159 --> 17:17.077
and play with us,
with your permission.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.705
Stop manipulating him to
go out with you, okay?

17:18.705 --> 17:21.081
-What is he, your ch...
-No.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.501
-Are you kidding me
right now, Bill?
-Hey man. Just...

17:23.501 --> 17:28.047
Wow, look at the blue
shirt twins.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.383
-[Bill] Are you serious?
-What are you doing here?

17:30.383 --> 17:33.260
I just thought maybe we could
talk, 'cause things are, like,
getting a little weird.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.304
-Sir.
-Kira, not now.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.015
There's no drinking beer
on school property, sir.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.432
-Go.
-I don't need that from her.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.184
Yeah, you brought beer
in front of the kids.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.311
-What are you, an idiot?
-[Kira] Sir?

17:42.311 --> 17:46.190
-Not now Kira.
-No, but, sir,
Lucy hurt her ankle.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.318
-[crying]
-This is your fault.
See what you did?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.905
-See what you did?
-You stop. Go. Go.

17:51.905 --> 17:55.074
-[Lucy crying]
-Watch out girls. Lucy.

17:55.074 --> 17:59.704
-What are you, like, 6'3"?
-He's 6'4", okay Bill?
Go wait in the car.

18:03.290 --> 18:07.045
Do you still have the student
pools, where you get money
for which couples break up?

18:07.045 --> 18:09.756
-Yes, the buy-in is 20 bucks.
-I want in, okay?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.966
-Yup.
-I've learned so much this
past year.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.385
I just wish there were bonus
points for who ends up preggers.

18:14.385 --> 18:18.389
-There are.
-Hello Mr. Cheeley.

18:18.389 --> 18:21.308
Hello Mr. Leung.
How are you today?

18:21.308 --> 18:24.562
My life is richly adequate.

18:24.562 --> 18:27.147
How are you? Today?

18:28.816 --> 18:32.445
Dandy. Just dandy.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.490
This is nice. In a
creepy unsettling kind of way.

18:41.287 --> 18:46.042
-I'm glad this all worked out.
-Me, too.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.383
This won't last.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.472
I know.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.400
All right, I told him
to meet us back here,
we'll catch him red-handed.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.277
-And then it's bye bye Jimmy.
-Yeah.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.196
And you're stoner friends.
Oh, here they are.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.616
-Hey, boys.
-[Simon] Fellas.

19:19.826 --> 19:23.746
That's a lot of, uh...
"wheatgrass".

19:23.746 --> 19:27.583
It is, but we wanted to give
you a little extra, since
you're our first customer.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.294
Maybe have some wheatgrass
brownies later?

19:30.294 --> 19:33.131
Yeah we're excited
about your wheatgrass.

19:33.131 --> 19:36.342
Poster of Bob Marley?
With little pictures
of Bob Marley inside of it.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.512
-[whispering] That's enough,
that's enough. That's enough.
-Building up a larger picture.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.806
We brought some for Mr. Hunt
too, he helped us out.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.809
How considerate.
How do we know it's good?

19:44.809 --> 19:48.104
Yeah, let's see the stuff,
make sure it's real. Pure.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.398
Okay, of course.
We brought test glasses.

19:51.398 --> 19:55.569
-What do you mean glasses of...
-[Jimmy] You guys can
try it out.

19:55.569 --> 19:59.157
It will give you more energy.
And improve your mental clarity.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.785
You could use that.
This looks a lot
like wheatgrass.

20:02.785 --> 20:07.581
-This is wheatgrass.
We're idiots.
-No, you're an idiot.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.709
-One wheatgrass please.
-Here you go.

20:09.709 --> 20:15.756
-Do you want one?
-Yeah, down this stuff
every day of my life.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.551
-[Simon] Oooh.
-It's good?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.553
It's all clear.
It's becoming clear.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.847
-It doesn't do anything shut up.
-That'll be 300 bucks.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.683
Hundred and fifty each.
I think is...

20:25.683 --> 20:29.896
No, I don't believe I
bought any. Gentlemen,
well done with science.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.481
Yeah, good work guys.
You're entrepreneurs.

20:32.481 --> 20:37.611
-Glad everything worked out.
-Okay, I'll bring you
that money next week.

20:37.611 --> 20:41.782
That's good stuff.
I just gotta get paid.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.960
