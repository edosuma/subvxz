HIS NAME IS MIKE.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.614
HE WAS ARGUING.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.345

09:15.380 --> 09:17.746
WITH THAT BASTARD,
MORT CROCKER.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.550
A MOUNTAIN LION.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.921
HE PINNED IT ON A MOUNTAIN LION.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.890
NOW, IF I CAN JUST
PROVE IT...

09:30.930 --> 09:31.897
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

09:31.930 --> 09:32.897

09:32.940 --> 09:34.862

09:34.900 --> 09:36.561

09:36.610 --> 09:37.599
IT WAS A YOUNG WOMAN.

09:38.970 --> 09:40.198

09:40.240 --> 09:41.639

09:42.880 --> 09:44.177

09:52.590 --> 09:54.717
THEY SAID IT WAS
A MOUNTAIN LION,

09:54.760 --> 09:56.751
BUT THEY WERE WRONG!

10:02.560 --> 10:04.494

10:04.530 --> 10:06.225

IS HEREDITARY.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.800

IS A YOUNG WOMAN

10:09.840 --> 10:11.467
WHO WAS FOUND DEAD 20 YEARS AGO,

10:11.510 --> 10:13.375
MAULED BY A MOUNTAIN LION.

10:13.410 --> 10:16.038
CONNORS AND I WORKED THE CASE.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.241
SO SHE WAS MURDERED?

10:18.280 --> 10:20.748
SHE WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

10:20.780 --> 10:21.917
A TRAGEDY, YES.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.212
A MURDER,

10:23.250 --> 10:24.387
NO.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.387
NOT THEN, AND NOT NOW.

10:25.420 --> 10:26.580
OKAY, OKAY.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.384
LET'S FORGET ZOE SHARP,
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE,

10:29.420 --> 10:31.854
BUT CONNORS STILL SAW THE GUY
ON THE "MISSING" POSTER

10:31.890 --> 10:32.925
ARGUING WITH MORT CROCKER

10:32.960 --> 10:34.097
IN THE PARK.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.654
WHAT?

10:35.700 --> 10:36.928
SHAWN...

10:36.970 --> 10:38.892
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CONNORS SAW
OR WHAT HE DIDN'T SEE.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.631
HIS MIND, THE PAST, THE PRESENT,
IT'S ALL SCREWY.

10:43.670 --> 10:44.762
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO HIM.

10:44.810 --> 10:45.936
SO HE SEES CROCKER

10:45.970 --> 10:47.232
STANDING THERE
IN THE PARK,

10:47.280 --> 10:48.804
IT TRIGGERS
AN OLD MEMORY OF ZOE,

10:48.840 --> 10:52.241
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
HE'S LIVING IN THE PAST.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.838
DAD, THIS GUY'S YOUR FRIEND.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.541
HE CAME TO ME FOR HELP.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.218
SHAWN, LEAVE HIM BE.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.717
HE DOESN'T NEED YOUR HELP

10:58.750 --> 11:01.514
TO MAKE HIM LOOK
LIKE AN OLD FOOL.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.120
HE DESERVES BETTER THAN THAT.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.754

WANT TO SEE THIS.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.132

LOOK.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.044
UH, COINCIDENCE?

11:26.080 --> 11:27.718
I DON'T THINK SO.

11:31.450 --> 11:34.010
SO WHEN MY FATHER SAID
HE SOLVED A MURDER,

11:34.060 --> 11:36.085
YOU THINK THIS IS THE GUY
THAT WAS KILLED?

11:36.120 --> 11:37.223
WELL--

11:37.260 --> 11:39.057
IT SEEMS LIKE
A SIMPLE QUESTION,

11:39.090 --> 11:40.398
DOESN'T IT, TRISH?

11:40.430 --> 11:41.522
I'M AFRAID THE ANSWER
IS A BIT MORE COMPLICATED.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.221
YOU SEE, AS A PSYCHIC,

11:43.270 --> 11:45.022
IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT I ELICIT

11:45.070 --> 11:47.459

11:52.310 --> 11:53.334
I'M SORRY.

11:54.510 --> 11:55.977
HOW MY AMAZING
GIFT WORKS.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.103

AT THIS.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.048
WHY DON'T YOU, UH...

11:59.080 --> 12:00.172
WHY DON'T YOU TELL TRISH

12:00.220 --> 12:01.573
HOW IT WORKS.

12:01.620 --> 12:02.848
I'VE GOT SOME...
SOME STUFF I NEED TO DO.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.187
SURE.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.847
THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION

12:05.890 --> 12:07.619
IS YES, WE DO BELIEVE
THAT IS THE VICTIM.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.981
SO, WHAT'S...
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

12:10.030 --> 12:13.158
WELL, BEING THAT
THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE

12:13.200 --> 12:14.519
HE WAS KILLED
BY A MOUNTAIN LION,

12:14.560 --> 12:17.996
SHAWN IS GOING TO ATTEMPT
TO ELICIT A...

12:18.030 --> 12:20.965
A PSYCHIC LINK
WITH THE SUSPECT,

12:21.000 --> 12:22.729
IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH ITS GUILT
OR INNOCENCE.

12:22.770 --> 12:25.466
AND BY SUSPECT,
YOU MEAN...

12:25.510 --> 12:27.535
THE MOUNTAIN LION, YES.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.070
AMAZING.
NOT REALLY.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.542
IT'S FAIRLY COMMON
FOR A PSYCHIC

12:34.580 --> 12:35.740
TO BE ABLE TO READ

12:35.780 --> 12:36.883
DIFFERENT SPECIES
OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.514
NO. NO, NOT THAT.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.585
WHAT?

12:40.620 --> 12:43.157
THE WAY THAT HE'S
SITTING THERE, SO...

12:43.190 --> 12:44.179
QUIET.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.629
I MEAN, IN...

12:45.660 --> 12:46.922
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

12:46.960 --> 12:48.257
HE WAS ALWAYS SO LOUD,

12:48.300 --> 12:49.289
AND NEEDED ATTENTION

12:49.330 --> 12:50.729
CONSTANTLY,

12:50.770 --> 12:51.964
AND NEEDED
TO BE NOTICED,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.560
AND HE JUST
WOULD NOT SHUT UP.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.067
HE WAS SO ANNOYING.
HE DROVE ME NUTS..

12:56.100 --> 12:58.967
BUT NOW...

12:59.010 --> 12:59.977
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.103
HE'S SO CALM.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.801
SO UNOBTRUSIVE.

13:03.850 --> 13:04.976
AND THE WAY HE LET YOU

13:05.010 --> 13:06.238
JUST STEP IN AND TAKE OVER
LIKE THAT...

13:07.450 --> 13:09.918
I THINK HE'S REALLY MATURED.

13:12.690 --> 13:14.419
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.087
HE HAS.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.121
DAD--

13:17.160 --> 13:18.320
NO. NO.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.396
HE WAS MAULED
BY A MOUNTAIN LION.

13:20.430 --> 13:21.658
YOU DON'T FIND THAT
THE LEAST BIT COINCIDENTAL?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.099
OF COURSE IT'S
COINCIDENTAL, SHAWN,

13:23.130 --> 13:25.428
BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE IT MURDER.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.789
NO, IT MAKES IT AN EPISODE

13:26.840 --> 13:28.990
OF WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK:
SANTA BARBARA.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.029
YES, WELL,

13:30.070 --> 13:31.469

IN SANTA BARBARA.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.829

THE NEWS, RIGHT?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.177
THAT'S YOUR SOURCE
OF PSYCHIC INFORMATION.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.303
IT HAPPENS.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.671
CONNORS CAME TO ME.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.177
HE SAYS, "I SOLVED A MURDER."

13:39.210 --> 13:40.177
SHAWN...

13:40.220 --> 13:41.915
CONNORS WAS A GOOD COP,

13:41.950 --> 13:43.440
AND THE THING
THAT MADE HIM A GOOD COP

13:43.490 --> 13:45.082
IS HE NEVER ACCEPTED
THE EASY ANSWER,

13:45.120 --> 13:48.248
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT HE WAS ALWAYS RIGHT.

13:48.290 --> 13:49.712
OBVIOUSLY,
SOMEWHERE IN HIS MIND,

13:49.760 --> 13:51.955
HE'S CONFUSED SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED 20 YEARS AGO

13:51.990 --> 13:54.993
WITH SOMETHING
THAT'S HAPPENED TODAY.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.349
OKAY, FINE.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.960
TALK TO ME MORE
ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO.

CONNECT TO MORT CROCKER?

14:06.670 --> 14:07.898
HE WAS THE C.E.O.

14:07.940 --> 14:10.079
AT THE TIME,
ZOE SHARP WAS HIS ASSISTANT,

14:10.110 --> 14:11.543
AND...

14:11.580 --> 14:12.569
THERE WAS A RUMOR--

14:12.610 --> 14:13.975

14:15.680 --> 14:17.079
NICE. THAT'S GOOD STUFF.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.280
AND CONNORS
KNEW ABOUT IT?

14:18.320 --> 14:19.287
OF COURSE
HE KNEW ABOUT IT--

14:19.320 --> 14:20.981
EVERY GOOD COP
MAKES IT HIS JOB

14:21.020 --> 14:22.214
TO KNOW ABOUT
THINGS LIKE THAT--

14:22.260 --> 14:23.750
BUT THERE WAS NEVER
ANY PROOF, SHAWN.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.849
NO PROOF,
AND EVEN IF THERE WAS...

14:25.890 --> 14:27.892
SOMEWHERE,
IN SOME CORNER OF HIS MIND,

14:27.930 --> 14:29.989
THERE IS A MEMORY,

14:30.030 --> 14:32.464

34:04.310 --> 34:05.732
WHAT ABOUT THIS TIME?
WITH MIKE?

34:05.770 --> 34:06.907
WHAT, HE JUST GOT LUCKY AGAIN?

34:06.940 --> 34:08.077
NO, NOT THIS TIME.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.475
THIS TIME HE HAD HELP.

34:09.510 --> 34:10.306
DeSOUP--
DeSOTO.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.774
DeSOTO
PROVIDED THE LION.

34:12.810 --> 34:14.414
DeSOTO? I KNOW THAT NAME.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.279
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER WHY.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.287
SIR, IT'S OKAY.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.184
WELL, I GOT TO
HAND IT TO YOU.

34:19.220 --> 34:21.154
THIS IS A TERRIFIC STORY.

34:21.190 --> 34:22.157
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.350
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING

34:23.390 --> 34:24.948
THAT MIKE CAN'T
HELP US WORK THROUGH.

34:24.990 --> 34:25.979
WHAT IS IT?

34:26.030 --> 34:27.622
CROCKER HAS
AN AIR-TIGHT ALIBI.

34:27.660 --> 34:29.355
HE WAS IN CHICAGO
WHEN MIKE WAS KILLED.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.697
OH, HE'S LYING.

34:30.730 --> 34:31.867
I CHECKED IT OUT
MYSELF, SIR.

34:31.900 --> 34:32.867
HE SPOKE
AT A SYMPOSIUM

34:32.900 --> 34:34.936
IN FRONT OF 200
OTHER PEOPLE.

34:34.970 --> 34:36.164
NO, NO. NOT AGAIN.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.167
NOT THIS TIME.

SIR...

34:39.710 --> 34:40.961
DADDY?

34:41.010 --> 34:43.137
HE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING STUPID,
WOULD HE?

34:43.180 --> 34:44.374
DEFINE "STUPID."

34:44.410 --> 34:46.344
GO AFTER CROCKER HIMSELF.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.245

35:07.130 --> 35:08.768
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.308
HOW DO YOU DO?
SO NICE TO--

35:12.340 --> 35:14.035
MORT CROCKER,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

35:14.070 --> 35:17.437

AND MIKE MCMILLAN.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.606
MR. CONNORS.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.299
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

35:20.350 --> 35:21.271
WHY DON'T YOU
HELP YOURSELF

35:21.320 --> 35:22.218
TO A DRINK.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.274
NO, NO, NO, NO.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.412
YOU MIGHT FOOL

35:24.450 --> 35:25.382
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE,

35:25.420 --> 35:26.409
BUT NOT ME.

35:28.090 --> 35:29.284
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, DARLING?

35:29.320 --> 35:30.412
EVERYTHING'S FINE, EDNA.

35:30.460 --> 35:31.779
PLEASE, GO BACK
TO OUR GUESTS.

35:31.830 --> 35:32.854

TAKE YOU HOME.

THE DISTURBANCE.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.593

AAH!

36:05.060 --> 36:06.755

36:06.790 --> 36:07.757
OH, COME ON.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.599
STOP ACTING LIKE A CHILD.

THANK YOU.

SHH.

36:47.130 --> 36:48.233
HE WAS HERE.

36:48.270 --> 36:49.430
WELL, OF COURSE HE'S HERE.

36:49.470 --> 36:50.835
WE SAW HIM COME IN, SHERLOCK.

36:50.870 --> 36:51.859
NO, NO,
NOT CONNORS.

36:51.910 --> 36:52.865
MIKE.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.775
MIKE MCMILLAN WAS HERE.

36:54.810 --> 36:55.799
WHAT?

36:55.840 --> 36:57.808
BUT...
YOU SOUND ALL MUFFLED.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.240
WHAT, ARE YOU EATING SOMETHING?

37:00.280 --> 37:01.315
HOW CAN--

37:01.350 --> 37:02.544
RIGHT. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

37:02.580 --> 37:03.569
MY BAD. MY BAD.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.148
HE WAS MUFFLED.

37:07.190 --> 37:08.179
MY FAULT.

37:08.220 --> 37:09.653
THERE.

37:09.690 --> 37:10.679
THERE.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.187
THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.788
PLEASE GET OUT OF HERE. NOW.

37:13.830 --> 37:16.890
I DON'T ALLOW ANYONE
INSIDE MY GREENHOUSE.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.625
WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE,
NOW, IS IT?

37:18.670 --> 37:21.389
YOU LET
MIKE MCMILLAN IN,

37:21.440 --> 37:22.498
DIDN'T YOU?

37:22.540 --> 37:24.303
I MEAN, THIS IS
WHERE YOU KILLED HIM.

37:24.340 --> 37:26.205
YOU SEE,
WHEN MIKE'S SPIRIT

37:26.240 --> 37:28.401
STARTED TALKING ABOUT CROCKER,

37:28.440 --> 37:29.839
I THOUGHT HE MEANT
MR. CROCKER,

37:29.880 --> 37:31.199
BUT HE WASN'T.

37:31.240 --> 37:34.539
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT MRS. CROCKER.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.548
WELL, FOR YOUR SAKE,

37:36.580 --> 37:38.684
YOU HAD BETTER BE RIGHT
THIS TIME.

37:40.020 --> 37:41.510
HE CAME TO SEE YOU,

37:41.560 --> 37:42.982
BUT YOU WEREN'T HERE.

37:44.390 --> 37:45.880
WHAT?

37:45.930 --> 37:48.649
MIKE, YOU KNOW
I DON'T SPEAK ITALIAN.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.190
SHOES.

37:50.230 --> 37:51.959
HE WANTS YOU
TO CHECK THE SHOES

37:52.000 --> 37:53.069
THAT HE WAS
WEARING THAT DAY.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.328
THE SOLES.

37:54.370 --> 37:56.292
YOU'LL FIND POTTING SOIL
IN THE TREAD

37:56.340 --> 37:57.534
THAT MATCHES THAT STUFF.

37:57.570 --> 38:00.459
EDNA, WHAT'S HE
TALKING ABOUT?

38:00.510 --> 38:01.534
EDNA...

38:01.580 --> 38:02.535
CAPTAIN .

38:02.580 --> 38:05.344
THAT'S WHY I KNOW THE NAME.

38:05.380 --> 38:09.077
BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED,
YOUR NAME WAS EDNA DeSOTO,

38:09.120 --> 38:11.111
AND YOU

38:11.150 --> 38:12.310
AND YOUR BROTHER, JOHN,
THE PARK RANGER,

38:12.350 --> 38:14.284
WERE IN THIS TOGETHER.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.083
HE USED THE LION

38:16.120 --> 38:18.486
TO COVER YOUR TRACKS.

38:18.530 --> 38:19.485
YOU'RE NOT REALLY

38:19.530 --> 38:20.952
GOING TO BELIEVE
THIS OLD FOOL?

38:20.990 --> 38:21.957
WATCH
WHO YOU'RE CALLING--

38:22.000 --> 38:23.228
WHAT?

38:23.260 --> 38:24.625
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS MY FAULT.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.194
I JUST WASN'T PAYING
ATTENTION TO YOU.

38:26.230 --> 38:27.595
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

38:27.630 --> 38:29.268
IT'S IN A BIRD FEEDER?

38:29.300 --> 38:30.289
NO, I'LL SAY IT.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.329
THERE'S
A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA

38:31.370 --> 38:32.359
OUT FRONT.

38:33.670 --> 38:34.705
APPARENTLY,
IT'S IN A BIRD FEEDER,

38:34.740 --> 38:36.776
AND IF THE TAPE
HASN'T BEEN ERASED,

38:36.810 --> 38:38.698
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE HIM ARRIVING...

38:40.550 --> 38:41.847
ON THE DAY HE WAS KILLED.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.517
PLEASE, EDNA,
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.379
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

38:51.430 --> 38:52.954
SOMEONE HAD TO PROTECT

38:52.990 --> 38:55.857
EVERYTHING
WE'VE WORKED SO HARD FOR.

38:55.900 --> 38:59.063
YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM
HALF OF EVERYTHING,

38:59.100 --> 39:01.466
JUST LIKE YOU WOULD'VE
HIS MOTHER.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.860
HE WAS MY SON.

39:07.940 --> 39:08.804
DETECTIVE,

39:08.840 --> 39:10.535
ARREST THIS WOMAN,

39:10.580 --> 39:11.842
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

39:11.880 --> 39:15.668
ISSUE A WARRANT
FOR THE ARREST OF JOHN DeSOTO,

39:15.720 --> 39:17.369

AND MIKE MCMILLAN.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.409

YOU HEARD THE CAPTAIN.

39:20.450 --> 39:22.418
GET 'EM OUT OF HERE.

39:31.430 --> 39:32.397

39:32.430 --> 39:33.294
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

39:33.330 --> 39:34.319
THANK YOU.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.902
SHOW-OFF.

39:46.180 --> 39:47.169
GOOD FOR YOU.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.848
YEAH, THANKS.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.883
IT'S A REAL HONOR, YOU KNOW.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.309
I THOUGHT THESE DAYS
WERE LONG GONE.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.181
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT?

39:56.220 --> 39:57.756
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

39:57.790 --> 39:59.929
I'M LUCKY
IF I COME OUT OF THE FOG.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.121
WELL, YOU GOT TO KEEP
YOUR BRAIN STIMULATED.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.752
TRY THE CROSSWORDS.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.222
NAH, I LIKE THAT, UM...

40:05.270 --> 40:06.589
SUDOKU.

40:06.630 --> 40:07.824
YEAH.

40:07.870 --> 40:10.589
WE COULD ALWAYS
GO AFTER COLD CASES.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.403
NAH.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.931
BEST TO LEAVE IT
TO THE YOUNG GUYS, HUH?

40:18.040 --> 40:20.474
THANKS FOR GIVING HIM
THIS DAY.

40:20.510 --> 40:23.047
I HOPE HE REMEMBERS IT
TOMORROW.

40:23.080 --> 40:27.312
HE CAN LET GO
AND MOVE ON.

40:27.350 --> 40:28.715
YOU KNOW?

40:28.760 --> 40:29.749
SHAWN.

40:29.790 --> 40:30.757
YEAH.

40:30.790 --> 40:33.623
WHAT? I'M SORRY. I...

40:33.660 --> 40:36.220
GOT A LITTLE LUMP IN MY THROAT.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.526
SPEAKING OF LUMPS...

40:40.570 --> 40:41.662
YES?

40:41.700 --> 40:43.793
THE OSTRICH,
THE TENNIS BALL?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.205
WHAT?

40:45.240 --> 40:46.309
YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:46.340 --> 40:47.762
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, OBVIOUSLY,

40:47.810 --> 40:50.870
BUT IT ALWAYS
BUGGED ME A LITTLE.

40:50.910 --> 40:52.878
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING, TRISH?

40:52.910 --> 40:54.241
HAT?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.941
"I THREW THE TENNIS BALL

40:59.690 --> 41:01.658
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

41:01.690 --> 41:03.885
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.285
RIGHT IS RIGHT.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.890
YOU REALLY STILL...

41:07.930 --> 41:09.989
HAVE NOT GROWN UP,
HAVE YOU?

41:42.930 --> 41:44.329
SHAWN, I TOLD YOU.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.499

FOR ME TO GET A GIRL.

41:46.530 --> 41:47.861
GET OVER THERE.
NO.

41:47.900 --> 41:49.936

41:51.870 --> 41:53.064
SHOW HER THE ABS.

41:53.110 --> 41:55.101
NOT UNTIL YOU CHALLENGE ME
STRAIGHT-UP.

41:56.210 --> 41:57.199
FINE.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.371
I WILL BE
KISSING TRISH...

42:01.410 --> 42:03.514
IN 10 MINUTES.

42:03.550 --> 42:05.381
NOT IF I GET THERE FIRST.
