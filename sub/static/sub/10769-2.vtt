WEBVTT

00:05.205 --> 00:07.139
Will.

00:07.607 --> 00:09.234
Will, would you hurry up already?

00:09.409 --> 00:12.242
If you think you can do it any faster,
then you come in here.

00:12.412 --> 00:15.711
Oh, stop your squawking.
We only have 15 minutes to do this.

00:15.882 --> 00:19.750
Hey, look, I just ain't trying to be
out there looking stupid, all right?

00:26.393 --> 00:27.417
Let's do this.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.972 --> 01:47.872
And action.

01:48.241 --> 01:53.474
Hi. As the king of poultry, I know what
good chicken should taste like, and if you...

01:55.381 --> 01:57.372
Hold up, Carlton. Wait a minute.

01:57.550 --> 02:01.452
A chicken eating chicken?
That's just sick.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.057
Hilary's gonna need her stage
in five minutes.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.090
- Oh, for crying out loud.
Whoa, whoa.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.955
Hey, hey, girl.
What's up? How you doing? Hey.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.257
What part of the chicken you like?

02:14.134 --> 02:19.094
Excuse me. Break it up.
You, out. Big Bird, back to work.

02:19.272 --> 02:22.070
I don't know why I'm doing this
dumb mess in the first place.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.676
Because if you don't,
I'll fire you from the Peacock.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.438
You'll drop out of school
and be wrestling for scraps...

02:27.614 --> 02:30.378
...with a guy named Joe
in the dumpster behind the Sizzler.

02:31.217 --> 02:34.914
But, hey, you have to live your own life.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.554
Hi. As the ain't-got-no-damn-choice
king of poultry...

02:40.727 --> 02:41.989
Cut.

02:43.363 --> 02:46.594
I am not experiencing happy chicken here.

02:48.868 --> 02:51.735
- Now I'm a happy chicken.
- Wait a minute, where are you going?

02:51.905 --> 02:55.363
- We haven't finished shooting the ad yet.
- Look, Carlton. I've had it, man.

02:55.542 --> 02:58.010
I'm 20 years old
and I'm in a chicken suit.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.976
You know, I'm just sick and tired
of doing these stupid jobs.

03:01.381 --> 03:05.477
With all due respect, Will,
you're not exactly overqualified.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.750
Read my beak: I quit.

03:09.489 --> 03:12.253
Wait a minute, you can't quit.
Get back here. I'm your boss.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.518
You better get back here.
Will, you better...

03:14.694 --> 03:16.355
- Come back to the set.
I'm done, no.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.394
- I need you on the set.
What's going on?

03:18.565 --> 03:19.589
It's him.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.762
He started it.

03:23.436 --> 03:25.597
Hill, do you have any job openings?

03:25.772 --> 03:28.206
I don't know. Ask Werner.
He's the producer.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.501
- Well, do you?
- Uh...

03:30.677 --> 03:33.942
As a matter of fact, we've been looking
for an assistant talent coordinator.

03:34.113 --> 03:37.344
It's a lot of hard work,
but there's room for advancement.

03:37.517 --> 03:40.782
All right. Assistant talent coordinator.

03:40.954 --> 03:44.685
Hey, I mean, I can assist. I'm talented.
Definitely coordinated.

03:44.857 --> 03:47.018
Hey, Carlton Banks here.
I'm Hilary's brother.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.753
I've been considering a vocational change
for some time now...

03:49.929 --> 03:50.953
Whoa, whoa, wait.

03:51.130 --> 03:54.065
What are you doing here, Teeny?
You already got a good job.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.327
This is a better job, so step aside.

03:56.502 --> 03:57.662
Anyway, as I was saying...

03:57.837 --> 04:01.238
You know, guys, I make it a rule
to stay clear of all domestic disputes.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.601
So, uh, Hilary?

04:03.843 --> 04:06.607
- Hilary, I never asked you for nothing.
- Okay, you're hired.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.076
- Yes.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.045
What about me? I'm your brother.

04:10.216 --> 04:13.549
Okay, then you can have the job.
Ha, ha. This is easy.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.452
- Hilary, you just said that I could...
- Okay, then you can have the job.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.649
- But you gave me the job.
- I'm getting a headache.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.295
Werner? Handle this, please?

04:24.364 --> 04:26.195
I've worked in management
for two years.

04:26.366 --> 04:29.802
I can type 100 words a minute,
I take shorthand, speak French and Spanish.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.164
I'm pre-law with a 4.0 average.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.270
And you?

04:34.440 --> 04:37.068
Well, you know,
I mean, I don't like to brag...

04:37.577 --> 04:40.944
- But?
- Oh, that's it. I just don't like to brag.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.447
Pay no attention to him. He's a chicken.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.177
But it was your idea
for me to be in this stupid suit.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.618
That's right, you've got it.
Ha, ha. He's a follower not a leader.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.384
No, sir. I'm your man, Werner.

04:53.559 --> 04:57.290
Listen, why don't we go grab lunch
and you can bring me up to speed.

04:57.664 --> 05:00.929
You know, you remind me of myself.
I used to be an entry-level butt-kisser too.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.805
Jazz, I'm telling you, man.
I would've been perfect for that job.

05:12.979 --> 05:18.246
That big Blow Pop head swindled his way in
and took what was mine.

05:18.418 --> 05:21.979
Damn. That's even worse
than getting beat up by a girl.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.517
But anyway, this ought to cheer you up.

05:27.593 --> 05:31.689
"Come get your freak on
at Club Freak On."

05:31.864 --> 05:35.197
Took me a long time to find something
that rhymed with Freak On.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.103
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh, well, well.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.207
MC Steal-a-Job is in the house.

05:42.375 --> 05:46.072
Do I detect a little hostility, Will?
Sour grapes perchance?

05:46.245 --> 05:49.112
Face it, you couldn't handle
the responsibility of a real job.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.306
It's not who you are.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.611
Leave the handling of the likes
of Maurice Perry to professionals.

05:53.786 --> 05:54.946
Maurice Perry, the comedian?

05:55.121 --> 05:58.488
The one and only. He's gonna be here
any minute with Hilary and Werner...

05:58.658 --> 06:01.252
...to talk about the possibilities
of being on my show.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.822
- Your show?
- It's only a matter of time.

06:04.997 --> 06:08.489
Anyway, we're gonna need the house.
So if you two don't mind...

06:08.668 --> 06:11.603
Even if you do mind, go away.

06:12.438 --> 06:16.499
- Master Carlton, your guest has arrived.
- Hey, look here, Thumbelina...

06:16.676 --> 06:19.201
Pay no attention
to my unemployed friend here.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.939
You really ought to bring Maurice
past the club tonight.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.742
I'm sure he wouldn't be interested.

06:23.916 --> 06:27.283
Besides, I have the pleasure
of escorting his sister around town tonight.

06:27.453 --> 06:30.547
Oh, two of y'all can fit on a Big Wheel?

06:30.723 --> 06:32.452
You were funnier with your beak on.

06:33.526 --> 06:38.088
That's it. Beak on.
"Come get your beak on at..."

06:38.765 --> 06:40.528
Shut up.

06:40.700 --> 06:45.763
Then this Chinese guy comes in and says,
"Supplies. Supplies."

06:45.938 --> 06:48.839
Oh, that is so funny.

06:49.008 --> 06:51.602
I don't get it, but you are so funny.

06:53.212 --> 06:55.373
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.015
I've always enjoyed your comedy.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.152
I'm somewhat known
for my bon mots myself.

07:00.319 --> 07:03.686
Excuse me, Bonbon?
We're not finished talking yet.

07:04.223 --> 07:05.952
Maurice, this is my cousin.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.559
Although we never really did
a background check.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.259
Oh, please. Sit down. Sit down.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.227
This is a business meeting.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.858
Why don't you go back into the kitchen
and play with your future cell mate?

07:18.037 --> 07:20.733
So, Maurice,
Hilary and I just wanna thank you...

07:20.907 --> 07:23.774
...for giving us the opportunity
to sit and chat a bit.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.343
Now, we're syndicated
in all primary markets now...

07:26.512 --> 07:28.412
...and we're scheduled to expand...

07:28.581 --> 07:30.276
Oh, speaking of schedules, Carlton.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.409
The clinic called.
You're still on for your implant tomorrow.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.353
Anyway, heh, our demographics
at the moment are very similar to...

07:39.525 --> 07:42.585
Ooh, Carlton, what is that on your lip?

07:42.762 --> 07:44.491
Will, there's nothing on my lip.

07:44.664 --> 07:50.125
Oh, nothing but the rotting residue
of the lies you told to steal my job.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.703
For God's sake, Will, accept it.
The better man won.

07:52.872 --> 07:56.603
Yeah? Well, the bigger, badder man's
about to beat the better man into oblivion.

07:56.776 --> 08:00.007
Hello?
- Sorry, Hilary, but this just has to be said.

08:00.179 --> 08:03.012
I've had about as much lip
as I'm gonna take from you.

08:03.182 --> 08:04.581
You think you can do this job?

08:04.750 --> 08:07.742
You think you've got the stuff
to handle high-profile celebrities?

08:07.920 --> 08:11.356
You think it's easy catering
to a low-rent Martin Lawrence wannabe?

08:11.524 --> 08:13.583
Huh? Huh? Huh?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.486
Pardon me. Pardon me.
I don't have to sit here and be insulted...

08:17.663 --> 08:20.427
...by some black Potsie Weber.
I'm out of here, okay?

08:21.100 --> 08:24.069
Werner, do something.
Oh, Will, this is all your fault.

08:24.237 --> 08:27.263
All right, all right.
Hey, hey, hey. Maurice, hold on, hold on.

08:27.440 --> 08:32.241
Hey, listen, man, this really doesn't have
anything to do with you.

08:32.410 --> 08:35.403
You kind of drifted into a no-fly zone.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.345
Look, Potsie don't know
what he talking about, all right?

08:39.751 --> 08:42.515
Look, you are all of that,
and the truth of the matter is...

08:42.688 --> 08:45.885
...Hilary's show is really cool,
the audience is growing every day...

08:46.058 --> 08:48.026
...and you'd have a great time doing it.

08:48.494 --> 08:51.122
- I don't know.
- Hey, look. Come on, man. I'm telling you.

08:51.297 --> 08:54.630
The honeys is buzzing around there
like a straight-up beehive, you know?

08:54.800 --> 08:57.200
- You know?
- All right, I'll do the show.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.530
All right.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.865
But keep the Smurf away from me.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.334
- That's doable. You're fired.
- Aah!

09:04.510 --> 09:06.205
Will, you're hired.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.944
Did you hear that?
You're fired and I'm hired.

09:12.118 --> 09:15.815
Did you hear the rumor
that Carlton was fired and Will was hired?

09:23.396 --> 09:26.832
<i>A court date has been set
for the long awaited trial of Tanya Baine...</i>

09:26.999 --> 09:30.901
<i>... the infamous show biz madam. It is
rumored that Miss Baine's pricey call girls...</i>

09:31.070 --> 09:34.198
<i>... counted some of Hollywood's
top leading men as clients.</i>

09:34.373 --> 09:37.968
<i>The high-profile case has been assigned
to the prominent Judge Philip Banks...</i>

09:38.144 --> 09:41.580
<i>... who was shown here this morning
leaving the courthouse.</i>

09:41.747 --> 09:44.511
<i>I'm not to talk right now.
It would jeopardize the case.</i>

09:44.684 --> 09:47.244
<i>- No, I'm sorry. Thank you very much.
One more question.</i>

09:47.420 --> 09:49.411
<i>Please, if you could answer one question.</i>

09:49.589 --> 09:52.524
You know, it's true what they say,
TV really does add 10 pounds.

09:52.692 --> 09:57.686
Hmm. What would account for
the other 250?

09:58.598 --> 10:02.432
You know, you're not a man
who enjoys employment, are you, Geoffrey?

10:02.835 --> 10:04.826
- I thought you looked wonderful.
- Thank you.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.564
- Let's go in the kitchen and get some...
- Food?

10:07.740 --> 10:09.401
Ha-ha-ha. Shut up.

10:09.575 --> 10:11.167
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.811
Well, I'm off to study.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.038
Don't stay out too late.
It's a school night.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.682
Ooh. I'm sorry, Ashley.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.108
Whoa.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.346
Studying, huh?
What is this, your geometry dress?

10:23.689 --> 10:25.384
Ellen wants to borrow it.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.991
Oh.

10:27.159 --> 10:32.620
Well, if it isn't the wise-cracking,
job-taking, sister-stealing slug himself.

10:32.798 --> 10:36.199
Whoo! Who's sucking on them
sour grapes now, huh, Carlton?

10:36.369 --> 10:39.861
I mean, sure, you lost your new job
and you can't get your old one back...

10:40.039 --> 10:42.030
...but we've all got problems.
Look at mine.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.905
I've got to take out a famous comedian's
beautiful sister and I'm out of Binaca.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.602
But you don't hear me crying, do you?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.180
Will, promise me
you'll be on your best behavior tonight.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.150
- Hey, aren't I always?
- I'm serious.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.517
It's really important
Maurice appear on my show.

10:58.691 --> 11:01.216
Everything has to go smoothly
with his sister tonight.

11:01.594 --> 11:05.621
All kidding aside, I know how much this
means to you, and it means a lot to me too.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.665
- I'm not gonna let you down.
- Okay. Thank you.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.395
May I present Miss Jasmine Perry.

11:19.045 --> 11:22.446
Now, which one of you handsome men
is Big Willy?

11:22.982 --> 11:24.643
He is.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.492
Mm. I'm ready to get my freak on.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.098
Looks like you already got it on.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.203
Listen, uh, you wouldn't wanna
go someplace...

11:45.371 --> 11:48.340
...you know, that was a little quieter,
you know, maybe darker?

11:49.041 --> 11:52.033
You're a little ahead of me, Big Willy.
But I'm game. Let's do this.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.236
- Whoa, whoa! Aah! Wait.
- Let's go.

11:54.413 --> 11:59.316
You know what? On second thought,
I think this place will be just fine.

12:38.657 --> 12:40.147
Aah! Hey, hey, hey.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.358
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

12:43.529 --> 12:44.894
Oh, no, it's my stomach.

12:45.064 --> 12:48.727
I probably should've waited
about an hour before we danced.

12:48.901 --> 12:53.634
You know what? You know what?
I should take you back to your hotel.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.612
Whoo!

13:03.783 --> 13:05.614
Hey, girls, here I go.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.312
All right.

13:10.489 --> 13:14.289
- Where's the troll?
- Oh, I put her back under her bridge.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.362
No, man, I dropped her off at the hotel.
Ready to kick off round two.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.591
Whoo! Ding, ding!

13:22.268 --> 13:25.863
Why don't you hurry and write your number
down before I don't want it no more?

13:26.238 --> 13:28.468
Come on, let's dance.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.640
Hey, what's up, Ash?

13:38.284 --> 13:39.478
Ashley?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.086
Oh, Will. I can explain.

13:44.023 --> 13:47.720
- I can't explain.
- Weren't you supposed to be studying?

13:47.893 --> 13:51.886
Oh, well, we did study, really fast,
and then we came here.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.856
You are learning entirely too much from me,
young lady.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.527
Oh, Will, it's just ginger ale.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.799
Come on, let's get something to drink.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.710
You're not gonna tell, are you?

14:07.980 --> 14:09.004
Behave yourself.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.040
- You too.
Hey.

14:16.722 --> 14:19.122
Hey, you wanna get a dance off?

14:23.095 --> 14:26.189
Why don't you get Maurice
something to drink?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.997
Whoo! You like that, huh?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.265
Oh! Oh!

14:36.775 --> 14:39.676
Hey. Hey, look who's here.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.870
- Where's Jasmine?
- Who?

14:42.047 --> 14:43.207
Jasmine.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.406
Oh!

14:44.583 --> 14:49.885
You said, "Jasmine,"
I thought you said, "Jazz, man."

14:50.055 --> 14:54.389
- Will, you dumped her, didn't you?
- Hey. Hey. Don't go conclusion jumping...

14:54.560 --> 14:57.188
You knew how important this was.
How could you do this?

14:57.363 --> 15:00.696
- But what had happened was...
- You gave me your word.

15:02.134 --> 15:03.692
You're right.

15:04.169 --> 15:06.228
I'll take care of this, Hill.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.033
Excuse me.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.877
Oh, man. Hey, G, did Jasmine call?

15:17.049 --> 15:18.710
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.612
I don't believe this. She's not at the hotel.
She's not at the restaurant.

15:23.789 --> 15:26.019
I don't know what to do.

15:26.625 --> 15:31.824
If she tells her brother that I dumped her,
ain't no way he's gonna do Hilary's show.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.526
I cannot believe that I blew this.

15:35.701 --> 15:39.364
First time I have a chance
to prove that I'm not a joke...

15:39.805 --> 15:41.466
...and I am.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.741
Perhaps you might enjoy
a bowl of soup, sir.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.504
Miss Jasmine brought it by for you.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.342
She was here?
Why didn't you say she was here?

15:50.516 --> 15:53.576
You asked if she called, sir.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.783
G, come on, man. Where is she?

15:56.288 --> 16:00.691
I don't know. I believe Master Carlton
took her to Club Freak On.

16:02.227 --> 16:03.489
Why would he do that?

16:03.662 --> 16:05.857
Don't know, don't care.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.358
Oh, I get it.

16:09.535 --> 16:13.995
He's trying to steal his job back,
and he's using Jasmine to do it.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.164
Ooh!

16:31.523 --> 16:33.991
Jazz, did you see that girl
I was here with earlier?

16:34.493 --> 16:37.326
Come on, man. I'm still trying to forget.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.088
Stop playing, man. Where is she?

16:39.264 --> 16:43.132
Gone. Boy, you got it bad.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.659
- Ashley.
- Yes, Daddy?

17:11.829 --> 17:13.491
How was studying?

17:13.665 --> 17:16.498
Um, fine.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.300
You know, the funniest thing happened.
You're never gonna believe...

17:20.472 --> 17:22.440
Uh-huh.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.741
Will a week cover it?

17:26.678 --> 17:28.703
Better make it two.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.747
Two's good.

17:50.536 --> 17:51.867
Aah!

17:53.539 --> 17:55.973
So did you do it?

17:56.375 --> 17:57.865
Well, I hope you're happy now.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.705
You know, you got what you wanted.
I'm out. You're in.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.771
- Is that about it?
- No, sir.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.749
I have only begun.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.318
See, you know what kills me...?

18:08.487 --> 18:11.388
I was laughing while I was walking home
because it's funny.

18:11.557 --> 18:16.324
You know, how we can live together
all these years, almost like brothers...

18:16.495 --> 18:19.430
...and you could still low-bridge me
the way you did.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.432
- Are you about done?
- Oh, no, sir.

18:22.601 --> 18:26.332
- Furthermore, you little...
- Snake? Weasel?

18:26.505 --> 18:27.597
- Oh, yes.
- Nerd?

18:27.773 --> 18:30.435
- Oh, yes.
- How about square-headed short stack?

18:30.609 --> 18:33.544
This is not the way
this is supposed to be going.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.646
You're mad at me for stealing your job?

18:35.814 --> 18:39.341
Right. You shouldn't have done that.
You knew how much I wanted this job.

18:39.518 --> 18:42.715
And you demonstrated that
by ditching your responsibility, Jasmine.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.550
Who may not be a looker,
but is quite an entertaining gal.

18:47.059 --> 18:50.085
Look, fine. Be that as it may,
it does not change what you did...

18:50.262 --> 18:51.854
...and what you always do to me.

18:52.030 --> 18:56.467
Man, you are just so selfish.
You got everything, but on top of that...

18:56.635 --> 18:59.069
...you gotta take everything
that everybody else has.

18:59.238 --> 19:02.605
Always about you.
Carlton. Carlton. Carlton.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.867
- You know what your problem is?
- No, I don't.

19:05.043 --> 19:08.911
You're a slacker. You say you want things
but you're never willing to work for it.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.412
You never make the sacrifice.

19:10.582 --> 19:13.244
You think you're just gonna
charm your way through.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.851
Just like your father.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.389
Let me tell you something.

19:20.559 --> 19:24.256
I am nothing like my father, all right?

19:24.796 --> 19:26.821
And I didn't steal your job.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.456
What are you talking about?

19:29.902 --> 19:33.599
Jasmine came by to see how
you were feeling and I covered for you.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.131
Her brother's gonna do the show.

19:37.442 --> 19:41.776
Really? Well, why'd you do that?
I thought you wanted that job.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.977
I did.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.911
But honestly,
I thought you're better for it.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.578
Yeah?

19:51.089 --> 19:54.581
And besides, the Ivy League looks down
on the entertainment industry.

20:00.699 --> 20:04.430
You had a great opportunity
to split my wig tonight, man.

20:04.603 --> 20:08.334
You usually don't pass up
opportunities like that.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.108
I thought it was time for a change.

20:12.811 --> 20:17.180
Damn, man, you gonna be making changes
in our relationship, you gotta let me know.

20:18.016 --> 20:20.177
I could've been down at the club,
you know.

20:20.352 --> 20:23.913
There's some hundred percent
USDA prime choice down there.

20:24.089 --> 20:27.217
I could be tenderizing right now.
Tenderizing as we speak.

20:30.195 --> 20:33.392
Hey, thanks a lot, man.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.893
Look, I'm sorry about that, all right?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.731
Hey, you're gonna find something
that's bigger and better.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.532
I have no doubt.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.767
- Hey, I owe you, man.
- Believe me, we're even.

20:44.943 --> 20:48.640
- No, no, no. I owe you.
- Trust me, we are definitely even.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.039
Oh.

20:51.216 --> 20:54.208
Listen, I'm tired.
Can you get that for me?

20:54.386 --> 20:55.910
Oh, yeah, no problem, buddy.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.319
You know what? I gotta think
of something real fly to do for Hill too.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.391
Get me and her back even again.

21:13.872 --> 21:18.104
Carlton was right.
It was only a three-and-a-half-hour virus.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.611
I can't wait for you to take me
to Santa Barbara for the weekend.

21:23.081 --> 21:25.675
I hear they have nude beaches.

21:37.329 --> 21:40.594
Carlton!
