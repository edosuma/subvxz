- She's an amazing woman.
I will always say this.

1:06:44.059 --> 1:06:46.909
It's just the one thing
that I've said repeatedly

1:06:47.004 --> 1:06:49.320
Is a red flag for me is the--
you know, the blowups,

1:06:49.339 --> 1:06:51.172
And the kind of--you know,
the kneejerk reactions.

1:06:51.324 --> 1:06:52.323
But I'm still hopeful.

1:06:52.417 --> 1:06:53.991
- Do you think--
- yeah.

1:06:54.085 --> 1:06:56.069
- What will happen will happen,
and it will all work out.

1:06:56.087 --> 1:06:58.013
- We definitely had our
ups and downs for sure too.

1:06:58.164 --> 1:07:02.183
So it's been intense for me
and johnny because we realized

1:07:02.410 --> 1:07:04.168
How much we didn't know
about each other.

1:07:04.262 --> 1:07:06.929
And so some of those things,
it's like, we're so similar

1:07:07.082 --> 1:07:09.098
In ways that can be
kind of conflict-y.

1:07:09.192 --> 1:07:11.251
- Yeah.

1:07:11.269 --> 1:07:14.029
- Because both of us can be
very dominant in relationships.

1:07:14.180 --> 1:07:15.255
- There's all these,
like, small things

1:07:15.273 --> 1:07:16.439
That we don't match on,

1:07:16.591 --> 1:07:17.940
But we match on,
like, core values.

1:07:18.093 --> 1:07:19.776
- Yeah.

1:07:19.870 --> 1:07:24.522
- And I'm very much like--
if 97% is good, 3% is bad,

1:07:24.541 --> 1:07:26.207
I focus and nitpick
the [bleep] out of the three.

1:07:26.359 --> 1:07:27.709
- I'm the same way.

1:07:27.936 --> 1:07:29.102
- 'cause I feel like
we've all--you know,

1:07:29.195 --> 1:07:30.453
We've all been dating...
- Yeah.

1:07:30.547 --> 1:07:32.047
- And we haven't settled

1:07:32.274 --> 1:07:33.289
Until this point--
up to this point.

1:07:33.383 --> 1:07:34.774
Why should we settle?

1:07:34.867 --> 1:07:36.793
And I'm looking
for everything, right?

1:07:36.945 --> 1:07:39.054
And I started feeling like...

1:07:39.205 --> 1:07:41.964
Like I'm the problem,

1:07:42.117 --> 1:07:44.726
And the past four
or five days have been good.

1:07:44.877 --> 1:07:46.061
Like, really good.

1:07:46.212 --> 1:07:47.303
It feels like
we turned a corner.

1:07:47.455 --> 1:07:48.712
- You seem like
you're in a better place.

1:07:48.732 --> 1:07:50.214
- I know, and I'm hoping
that we build on it.

1:07:50.233 --> 1:07:51.457
Just keep having
more good days.

1:07:51.551 --> 1:07:53.551
- We had a tough conversation,

1:07:53.570 --> 1:07:55.962
And a lot of things that I've
been holding in came out,

1:07:56.055 --> 1:07:57.739
And they needed to come out.

1:07:57.890 --> 1:08:01.801
Told her about my past

1:08:01.894 --> 1:08:03.745
And that maybe sometimes I did

1:08:03.896 --> 1:08:05.988
Previously wait too long
to get into that.

1:08:06.083 --> 1:08:07.990
I told her that I was
kind of feeling those doubts.

1:08:08.143 --> 1:08:09.809
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:09.828 --> 1:08:11.419
- This is just such--
this is 100% a feeling.

1:08:11.571 --> 1:08:13.237
- Yeah, yeah.

1:08:13.331 --> 1:08:14.255
- And you gotta have that spark
that I need to feel...

1:08:14.407 --> 1:08:15.648
- Yeah, yeah.

1:08:15.741 --> 1:08:16.816
- And that's what
I'm waiting on.

1:08:16.909 --> 1:08:18.668
- I don't know
what he likes about me.

1:08:18.762 --> 1:08:20.653
I don't know anything.
I don't even know if he does.

1:08:20.746 --> 1:08:22.097
- Have you asked him that?
- Yep.

1:08:22.324 --> 1:08:23.823
He said
he's waiting for a feeling

1:08:23.842 --> 1:08:26.083
That he doesn't have.
- Ugh.

1:08:26.103 --> 1:08:28.269
- What do you think
that feeling is?

1:08:28.421 --> 1:08:32.832
- Butterflies or something.
- That's--

1:08:32.851 --> 1:08:35.017
[chuckles]
- why is--

1:08:35.170 --> 1:08:36.760
- Why can't that be a thing?

1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:39.689
Like, why can't you just be
enthralled with your wife,

1:08:39.841 --> 1:08:42.433
And--I don't know.
- Yeah.

1:08:42.527 --> 1:08:44.193
- But I just don't know that
I would ever get to that point.

1:08:44.287 --> 1:08:47.455
And is that good enough?
I don't want good enough.

1:08:47.607 --> 1:08:50.867
- With this situation,
this is not regular dating,

1:08:50.961 --> 1:08:52.627
So I think there's
a huge element where you do

1:08:52.778 --> 1:08:56.464
Have to make a decision that
I'm gonna try to get there.

1:08:56.616 --> 1:08:57.799
- Mm-hmm.
- Right.

1:08:57.950 --> 1:08:59.709
- You can't just sit back
and just expect.

1:08:59.803 --> 1:09:01.136
You can't sit back
and just wait for a feeling.

1:09:01.363 --> 1:09:02.695
- Right.

1:09:02.714 --> 1:09:03.954
- You have to
actually do things...

1:09:03.974 --> 1:09:05.140
- Right.
- To create those feelings.

1:09:05.291 --> 1:09:06.215
- And that's what
you need to tell him.

1:09:06.309 --> 1:09:07.475
That's exactly--

1:09:07.627 --> 1:09:08.701
- Did you tell him
that part though?

1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:09.886
- Everything you telling us
right now

1:09:10.038 --> 1:09:10.979
Is exactly what you need
to be telling him.

1:09:11.130 --> 1:09:12.205
- It's easier to tell
my friends.

1:09:12.298 --> 1:09:13.706
- What are you gonna do
going forward?

1:09:13.799 --> 1:09:15.466
Like, are you still gonna--

1:09:15.485 --> 1:09:16.559
- We're gonna have to have
more conversations about it.

1:09:16.653 --> 1:09:18.319
- Yeah.

1:09:18.471 --> 1:09:20.046
- 'cause you need to know,
are you wasting your time

1:09:20.139 --> 1:09:21.047
Putting in the effort,
or are you not?

1:09:21.065 --> 1:09:22.715
- Right, right.

1:09:22.734 --> 1:09:24.325
- Because if this feeling--
"what if I don't get

1:09:24.477 --> 1:09:25.067
This feeling
for two years from now?"

1:09:25.220 --> 1:09:26.736
- Right.

1:09:26.830 --> 1:09:28.070
- Like, who in the hell
is waiting that long?

1:09:28.165 --> 1:09:29.330
- Right, right.
- Let's expedite this feeling.

She did.

1:10:19.049 --> 1:10:22.442

1:10:22.460 --> 1:10:23.885
- A machete.

1:10:24.112 --> 1:10:25.278
- Yeah, well,
it was like a butter knife,

1:10:25.296 --> 1:10:26.946
But it was still a knife.

1:10:27.039 --> 1:10:28.706
I felt my life was threatened,

1:10:28.725 --> 1:10:31.467
So I did tell her back
that I loved her.
