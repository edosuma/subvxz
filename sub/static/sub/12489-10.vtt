WEBVTT

00:06.177 --> 00:08.509
EVERYONE ALWAYS
WANTS TO BE "RESPONSIBLE."

00:08.509 --> 00:10.681
BUT WHAT IS "RE" "SPONSIBLE"?

00:10.681 --> 00:13.544
ARE YOU BEING "SPONSIBLE"
FOR A SECOND TIME?

00:13.544 --> 00:16.217
OOH, I WISH I HAD THOUGHT OF
THAT IN MY OLD STAND-UP DAYS.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.018
( Seinfeld -like music )

00:18.018 --> 00:20.221
WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH DOG BISCUITS?

00:20.221 --> 00:23.524
THEY'RE NOT MADE OUT OF DOGS,
AND THEY'RE NOT BISCUITS.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.657
Man: THEY ARE BISCUITS!
AND THEY'RE FOR DOGS!

00:26.657 --> 00:30.661
OH. THEN I GUESS
MY NEXT 20 MINUTES AREN'T
GOING TO MAKE ANY SENSE.

00:32.503 --> 00:34.405
BUT WHEN PEOPLE
GET RESPONSIBILITY,

00:34.405 --> 00:35.636
THEY DON'T ALWAYS
FOLLOW THROUGH.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.569
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WIPE YOUR HAIR
OUT OF THE SHOWER DRAIN!

00:38.569 --> 00:40.711
DO YOU KNOW
HOW GROSS THAT IS?

00:40.711 --> 00:42.713
IT'S LIKE A SECOND
LITTLE HEAD DOWN THERE.

00:44.075 --> 00:45.576
I SAID I'D DO IT
FOR A DOLLAR.

00:45.576 --> 00:48.279
WHY WON'T YOU DO ANYTHING
UNLESS SOMEONE PAYS YOU FOR IT?

00:48.279 --> 00:50.451
I'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION
FOR 50 CENTS.

00:51.622 --> 00:52.653
COME ON, AVERY.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.285
I'M SAVING UP
FOR A BMX BIKE.

00:54.285 --> 00:56.787
THEN WHY'D YOU
BLOW ALL YOUR MONEY
ON A FIFTH HAIR DRYER?

00:56.787 --> 00:59.460
WHY'D YOU BLOW ALL YOUR MONEY
ON OIL PAINT AND BRUSHES?

00:59.460 --> 01:00.661
I'M MAKING ART!

01:00.661 --> 01:02.763
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?

01:02.763 --> 01:05.666
AHH. HEARING THE TWO OF YOU
FIGHT ALMOST MAKES ME GLAD

01:05.666 --> 01:07.098
MOTHER'S YEARS
OF BODY BUILDING

01:07.098 --> 01:10.070
KEPT HER TOO BUSY
TO HAVE A SECOND CHILD.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.603
KARL, GO... AWAY.

01:13.744 --> 01:15.075
HE'S SO WEIRD.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.577
ALWAYS SPYING ON US.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.480
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"ALWAYS SPYING"?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.582
KARL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.584
JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAD
AN EXTRA SEAT IN YOUR CAR

01:23.584 --> 01:25.716
FOR YOUR FAMILY'S TRIP
TO THE WATERPARK NEXT WEEKEND.

01:25.716 --> 01:27.718
HOW'D YOU KNOW WE WERE
GOING TO THE WATERPARK?

01:27.718 --> 01:29.560
SOMETIMES YOUR MOTHER
AND I HAVE TEA.

01:30.761 --> 01:32.763
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

01:32.763 --> 01:35.526
WE'RE NOT TAKING YOU
TO THE WATERPARK, OKAY?

01:35.526 --> 01:36.727
GO WITH YOUR OWN FAMILY.

01:36.727 --> 01:39.630
I DID... ONCE.

01:39.630 --> 01:40.801
PICTURE MY MOTHER.

01:40.801 --> 01:45.105
HER MASSIVE SHOT PUTTER'S FRAME
TRAPPED INSIDE THE FLUME.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.839
THE PRESSURE OF THOUSANDS
OF GALLONS OF WATER BUILDING
BEHIND HER TO FINALLY VOOM!

01:48.839 --> 01:50.641
SHE SHOOTS THROUGH
LIKE A ROCKET.

01:50.641 --> 01:55.546
NOW IMAGINE THE POOR CHILD
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE
WAITING TO TAKE A PICTURE.

01:55.546 --> 01:57.288
SLOW DOWN MOTHER.

01:57.288 --> 01:58.319
SLOW DOWN.

02:00.491 --> 02:02.122
FORGET IT, KARL.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.195
WOULD THAT I COULD.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.527
THIS IS THE PICTURE.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.501
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE
THAT AS YOUR WALLPAPER?

02:12.233 --> 02:15.836
WHY IS MY FLYER
FOR THE CLASSICAL CONCERT
IN THE PARK IN THE TRASH?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.438
BECAUSE THE SHREDDER
WAS BROKEN.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.210
ARE WE DONE HERE?

02:19.210 --> 02:21.812
THEY'RE HONORING NORWEGIAN
COMPOSER EDVARD GRIEG.

02:21.812 --> 02:23.143
IT'S CALLED
"GRIEG IN THE GRASS."

02:23.143 --> 02:24.215
WE HAVE TO GO.

02:24.215 --> 02:26.417
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M BUSY ON...

02:26.417 --> 02:28.649
TODAY.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.351
WE CAN'T MISS THIS!

02:30.351 --> 02:33.824
IT'S A... OPPORTUNITY
TO EXPOSE THE KIDS
TO SOME REAL CULTURE.

02:33.824 --> 02:36.727
HONEY, DIDN'T WE
LEARN OUR LESSON
AT "BACH ON THE DOCK"?

02:36.727 --> 02:37.928
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.

02:37.928 --> 02:39.790
THERE'S NO DOCK
THIS TIME.

02:39.790 --> 02:42.293
AND YOU CAN'T
FALL OFF THE GRASS.

02:42.293 --> 02:45.766
EVEN IF DO SAY YES,
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN CONVINCE THE KIDS?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.638
PLEASE.

02:47.638 --> 02:50.601
I CAN MAKE THIS SOUND
LIKE THE MOST EXCITING
THING IN THE WORLD.

02:50.601 --> 02:52.873
WHO WANTS TO BASK
IN THE SWEET SOUNDS

02:52.873 --> 02:56.607
OF "FUNERAL MARCH
AND MEMORY OF NICARD NORDREG"?

02:57.808 --> 02:59.850
SO WHAT IF
THE SHREDDER'S BROKEN?

02:59.850 --> 03:02.213
COULDN'T YOU HAVE
JUST EATEN IT?

03:02.213 --> 03:04.615
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TWO GO
TO THE CONCERT YOURSELVES?

03:04.615 --> 03:06.557
YOU'RE ALWAYS
COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

03:06.557 --> 03:08.319
"HUSBAND AND WIFE" TIME,
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

03:08.319 --> 03:09.790
WELL, I THINK IT MEANS--

03:09.790 --> 03:11.792
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS,
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.365
HEY, HE MAKES A POINT.

03:14.365 --> 03:17.268
WHY DON'T WE SHOW THE KIDS
WHAT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP IS?

03:17.268 --> 03:19.930
HONEY, WILL YOU GO
ON A DATE WITH ME?

03:19.930 --> 03:22.833
FINE, IF I HAVE TO.

03:22.833 --> 03:24.975
JUST LIKE WHEN I PROPOSED.

03:24.975 --> 03:26.507
HEY! YOU PACK A PICNIC.

03:26.507 --> 03:29.380
I'LL GO GET MY GRIEG SHEET MUSIC
SO WE CAN FOLLOW ALONG!

03:29.380 --> 03:30.881
GREAT IDEA!

03:30.881 --> 03:32.943
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

03:35.386 --> 03:37.518
HOW COULD YOU GUYS
PASS UP GOING TO THE PARK?

03:37.518 --> 03:39.820
IT'S NORWEGIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.851
EXACTLY!

03:40.851 --> 03:42.823
IT'S OLD PEOPLE
EATING ON THE GROUND.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.897
DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT IS
TO WRESTLE A WHEEL OF CHEESE
FROM AN 82-YEAR-OLD WOMAN?

03:47.898 --> 03:50.331
UNFORTUNATELY, I DO.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.234
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS IS MY CHEESE!

03:54.234 --> 03:55.606
YOUR BLANKET'S OVER THERE!

04:20.431 --> 04:21.762
WE'LL ONLY BE
GONE A COUPLE HOURS.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.863
A COUPLE HOURS?

04:22.863 --> 04:25.396
AREN'T THEY JUST
PLAYING HIS HITS?

04:25.396 --> 04:26.767
AVERY, YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.669
WHAT? I WANT TO BE IN CHARGE.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.671
( all laughing )

04:32.042 --> 04:33.444
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

04:34.745 --> 04:36.307
WHAT DID I MISS?

04:36.307 --> 04:37.678
TYLER WANTS TO BE IN CHARGE.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.512
CLASSIC!

04:42.953 --> 04:44.955
WHY IS THAT SO FUNNY?
I'M OLDER.

04:44.955 --> 04:49.560
I CAN REACT, ON A DIME,
TO ANY PROBLEM WITH
A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.893
I'M OLDER.

04:52.893 --> 04:53.924
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:53.924 --> 04:55.496
TYLER, YOU ARE THE OLDEST.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.497
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.998
JUST KEEP AN EYE ON CHLOE.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.330
YES!

04:59.330 --> 05:00.771
I HAVE FAITH THAT YOU
CAN HANDLE THIS.

05:00.771 --> 05:02.903
AVERY, KEEP AN E-Y-E ON HIM.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.775
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

05:04.775 --> 05:07.007
AS LONG AS I'M THE ONE WHO'S
GETTING PAID TO BABYSIT.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.839
YOU KNOW, I'M SAVING UP
FOR A NEW BMX BIKE.

05:08.839 --> 05:11.382
THEN WHY'D YOU BLOW ALL
YOUR MONEY ON THAT CRAZY
CARDBOARD CUT-OUT?

05:12.383 --> 05:13.484
LOOK WHAT I GOT!

05:18.949 --> 05:21.552
CHLOE IS NOT TO GO
OUTSIDE UNSUPERVISED,

05:21.552 --> 05:22.453
AND NO EATING CANDY.

05:22.453 --> 05:23.524
WHAT?

05:23.524 --> 05:24.625
CHLOE, WHERE WERE YOU?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.797
OUTSIDE EATING CANDY.

05:26.797 --> 05:28.659
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS,
SWEETHEART.

05:28.659 --> 05:30.631
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU
TO EAT SO MUCH SUGAR.

05:30.631 --> 05:34.505
DON'T YOU WANT TO GROW
UP TO BIG AND STRONG
LIKE KARL'S MOM?

05:34.505 --> 05:36.707
YES.

05:36.707 --> 05:38.038
COME ON, HONEY.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.470
WE'RE GOING TO BE
LATE FOR THE CONCERT.

05:39.470 --> 05:40.971
ISN'T THERE SOMEPLACE
ELSE WE CAN GO?

05:40.971 --> 05:42.012
LIKE MEXICO!

05:42.012 --> 05:43.013
THEY HAVE MUSIC.

05:43.013 --> 05:45.015
( humming "Mexican Hat" song )

05:47.718 --> 05:49.950
WHOA! YOU HEARD MOM AND DAD.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.552
NO EATING CANDY.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.554
WELL, HOLD ON A SECOND, AVERY.
I'M IN CHARGE.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.556
YEAH!
CHLOE, NO MORE CANDY.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.888
AW! I THOUGHT WE WERE COOL.

05:57.888 --> 05:59.490
HAND IT OVER.

06:00.691 --> 06:01.762
IS THAT ALL?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.466
AND...?

06:08.539 --> 06:09.870
THANK YOU.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.971
THIS STINKS.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.843
( doorbell )

06:12.843 --> 06:17.708
WELL, IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS THAT STUPID CLASSICAL
MUSIC CONCERT IN THE PARK.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.710
HEY, NIKKI, WHAT'S UP?

06:19.710 --> 06:22.413
I CAME BY TO GET
THE JACKET I LEFT HERE.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.615
I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE
"GRIEG IN THE GRASS."

06:24.615 --> 06:26.457
YOU'RE A GRIEG FAN TOO?

06:26.457 --> 06:27.558
I WAS JUST HEADING OVER THERE!

06:27.558 --> 06:29.460
I THOUGHT I WAS
THE ONLY ONE
WHO LOVED HER.

06:29.460 --> 06:30.461
HIM.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.694
YOU LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.065
OH, I LOVE IT.

06:35.065 --> 06:38.469
GRIEG, AND, UH, UH,
THE GUY WITH THE WHITE HAIR,

06:38.469 --> 06:40.000
AND THE GUY WHO
CUT HIS EAR OFF.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.502
VAN GOUGH?

06:41.502 --> 06:42.633
YEAH, MY PARENTS TOOK IT,
WE'LL HAVE TO WALK.

06:42.633 --> 06:43.834
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

06:43.834 --> 06:47.037
WHOA! WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU BEING IN CHARGE?

06:47.037 --> 06:49.580
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HERE ALL AFTERNOON!

06:49.580 --> 06:50.541
Tyler: I WILL BE.

06:50.541 --> 06:53.514
KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS, DUDE.

06:54.585 --> 06:57.848
IF I LOOKED LIKE THAT,
I'D BE SMILING, TOO.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.894
YOU KNOW,
THAT REMOTE DOESN'T WORK.

07:03.894 --> 07:04.955
I KNOW.

07:04.955 --> 07:06.527
THIS IS WHERE I KEEP
MY JELLY BEANS.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.128
NO!

07:08.128 --> 07:11.031
WHY YOU TAKING MY BEANS?

07:11.031 --> 07:15.205
HEY, TYLER.
LOOKING GOOD, BUDDY.

07:15.205 --> 07:18.569
I KNOW WE WANTED FLATTER ABS,
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

07:18.569 --> 07:20.571
OOH, I GOT TO USE THAT!

07:20.571 --> 07:22.042
AND THEN I SAID,

07:22.042 --> 07:25.546
"I KNOW WE WANTED FLATTER ABS,
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS!"

07:25.546 --> 07:26.747
Man: YOU STINK!

07:26.747 --> 07:28.719
THAT'S 'CAUSE I ROLL
IN MY OWN POO.

07:28.719 --> 07:31.622
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

07:31.622 --> 07:32.823
( phone ringing )

07:32.823 --> 07:34.725
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW IRRESPONSIBLE TYLER WAS,

07:34.725 --> 07:35.686
BAILING LIKE THIS.

07:35.686 --> 07:37.027
HEY, LINDSAY!

07:37.027 --> 07:39.229
HE'S AT THE BOOKSTORE?

07:39.229 --> 07:40.230
RIGHT NOW?

07:40.230 --> 07:42.162
( gasps )

07:42.162 --> 07:44.695
LOOK, I'D REALLY LOVE A SIGNED
COPY OF MECROPOLIS HIGH,

07:44.695 --> 07:46.567
BUT I'M BEING RESPONSIBLE,

07:46.567 --> 07:48.869
AND BABYSITTING
MY LITTLE SISTER.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.108
OKAY, STAN! YOU WATCH CHLOE!

07:58.108 --> 07:59.610
THIS IS NOT IRRESPONSIBLE.

07:59.610 --> 08:00.811
IT HAS TO DO WITH BOOKS!

08:06.717 --> 08:07.918
UH-UH!

08:07.918 --> 08:09.119
I'M IN CHARGE NOW,

08:09.119 --> 08:10.821
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE EATING STUFFING.

08:10.821 --> 08:12.963
IT'S NOT STUFFING,
IT'S COTTON CANDY.

08:15.526 --> 08:17.528
( spitting )

08:18.799 --> 08:21.732
WRONG PILLOW.

08:21.732 --> 08:24.735
( classical music playing )

08:28.709 --> 08:30.541
( snoring )

08:30.541 --> 08:31.912
AHH! IT'S NOT MY PENGUIN!

08:31.912 --> 08:34.885
All: SHH!

08:34.885 --> 08:36.186
BENNETT, YOU'RE SLEEPING!

08:36.186 --> 08:37.588
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

08:37.588 --> 08:39.189
NO! I WASN'T SLEEPING.

08:39.189 --> 08:41.051
I WAS... TRANSPORTED.

08:41.051 --> 08:43.754
THIS KIND OF MUSIC
JUST SENDS ME SOMEWHERE.

08:43.754 --> 08:45.696
SOMEWHERE WITH PENGUINS?

08:45.696 --> 08:49.129
HONEY, WE'RE HAVING
HUSBAND-WIFE TIME.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.132
IT'S A RARE CHANCE FOR US
TO BE AWAY FROM THE KIDS.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.575
CHLOE, THERE ARE
TWO KINDS OF DOGS IN THIS WORLD:

09:04.575 --> 09:07.818
THE RESPONSIBLE KIND
AND SCHNAUZERS.

09:07.818 --> 09:11.051
AND I AM NO SCHNAUZER.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.154
THEY COULD NOT HAVE PICKED
A BETTER BABYSITTER, HUH, CHLOE?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.156
CHLOE?

09:18.128 --> 09:20.060
CHLOE?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.231
CHLOE!

09:21.231 --> 09:22.893
OH, NO! I'VE LOST CHLOE.

09:22.893 --> 09:24.795
WHAT A SCHNAUZER MOVE.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.700
OH, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE CHLOE DRESSED
IN AN AVERY COSTUME.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.242
OH, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVEN'T LOST CHLOE.

09:32.242 --> 09:35.345
WELL, WE'VE BOTH DISAPPOINTED
EACH OTHER, HAVEN'T WE?

09:42.613 --> 09:43.914
THAT'S IT.

09:43.914 --> 09:45.686
CHLOE'S NOWHERE
IN THIS HOUSE.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.988
( sighs )
I TRUSTED YOU, STAN.

09:47.988 --> 09:52.022
YOU'RE THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE
TALKING DOG I'VE EVER KNOWN.

09:52.022 --> 09:53.964
I KNOW, I KNOW!

09:53.964 --> 09:55.726
AND I'M 1/8 SHEPARD.

09:55.726 --> 09:58.368
IT'S MY JOB TO KEEP
THE FLOCK TOGETHER,
AND I BLEW IT!

09:58.368 --> 10:00.300
NOW MY SHEEP
IS ON THE LAM.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.932
SHE'S "A-WOOL."

10:01.932 --> 10:05.035
THIS IS "BAAAAD."

10:06.136 --> 10:07.808
WE'VE GOT TO FIND CHLOE.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.841
AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND ME
AN OPEN-MIC NIGHT.

10:10.841 --> 10:14.114
LOOK, WE NEED TO FIND CHLOE
BEFORE MOM AND DAD GET BACK.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.846
AND WE NEED ALL
THE HELP WE CAN GET.

10:15.846 --> 10:16.947
I CALL TYLER.

10:16.947 --> 10:18.018
I'LL GET CHLOE.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.821
OH, RIGHT.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.654
SHE'S GONE?

10:23.654 --> 10:25.796
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU LEFT?

10:25.796 --> 10:29.629
WHAT KIND OF PERSON LEAVES
WHEN THEY'RE IN CHARGE
OF WATCHING SOMEONE?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.803
FINE, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

10:32.803 --> 10:34.234
WHAT'S "IRONY"?

10:34.234 --> 10:36.306
IN ART OR LITERATURE--

10:36.306 --> 10:37.868
NEVER MIND,
MY SISTER'S MISSING.

10:37.868 --> 10:41.111
( gasps )
THAT'S HORRIBLE!

10:41.111 --> 10:43.143
YEAH, IT REALLY IS HORRIBLE.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.144
SHOULDN'T YOU RUSH HOME?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.976
IN A MINUTE.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.918
DO YOU WANT ME TO COME
WITH YOU AND HELP?

10:47.918 --> 10:49.119
NO, STAY HERE.

10:49.119 --> 10:50.180
WE LOSE MY SISTER ALL THE TIME.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.251
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.324
BUT IT'S HORRIBLE!
OH!

10:57.257 --> 10:58.729
EXCUSE ME.

10:58.729 --> 11:00.991
PARDON ME.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.662
WHOA!

11:05.736 --> 11:07.067
YOU LIKE THAT, HONEY?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.839
LIKE WHAT?

11:11.772 --> 11:14.144
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S NICE, HONEY.

11:14.144 --> 11:16.176
I COULD STAY
LIKE THIS FOREVER.

11:21.111 --> 11:22.983
Avery: WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.855
I WAS THE VICTIM OF
A SENSELESS HUGGING.

11:26.156 --> 11:27.187
I TOLD YOU TO WATCH HER.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.159
AND I TOLD STAN TO WATCH HER.

11:29.159 --> 11:30.290
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.022
I LOST A MEMBER OF THE PACK.

11:32.022 --> 11:33.693
BUT I CAN FIND HER.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.125
I'M 1/8 BLOODHOUND.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.426
I'VE GOT HER SCENT.

11:36.426 --> 11:37.467
I'M ON IT.

11:37.467 --> 11:39.099
( sniffing )
CHLOE?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.072
1/8 IS REALLY NOT THAT MUCH.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.035
IT'S ALL RIGHT, STAN.
HEY, GUYS!

11:45.035 --> 11:47.337
LET'S SPLIT UP, AND WE'LL
SCOUR THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

11:47.337 --> 11:48.779
AND IF WE CAN'T FIND HER,

11:48.779 --> 11:50.981
I PUT ON A RED WIG,
WALK AROUND SAYING,

11:50.981 --> 11:52.142
"WHY YOU TAKING MY BEANS?"

11:59.790 --> 12:05.195
WHOA. SO, THAT'S A SUGAR CRASH.

12:06.196 --> 12:08.358
CHLOE! CHLOE?

12:11.231 --> 12:14.004
NO TIME. NO TIME.

12:14.004 --> 12:15.235
CHLOE'S NOT HERE.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.167
BETTER CHECK THE PLAYGROUND.

12:17.167 --> 12:18.869
HE'S MY MASTER.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.140
I CAN'T HELP IT.

12:20.140 --> 12:24.074
HONEY, WE'RE IN PUBLIC.

12:28.218 --> 12:29.219
KARL, CHLOE'S MISSING.

12:29.219 --> 12:30.981
WE'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE,

12:30.981 --> 12:33.223
AND OBVIOUSLY WE WOULDN'T
BE HERE IF WE WEREN'T DESPERATE.

12:33.223 --> 12:36.186
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU HERE
UNLESS YOU WERE DESPERATE.

12:36.186 --> 12:38.258
ARE THOSE MY GYM SOCKS?

12:38.258 --> 12:42.232
YOU CAN HAVE THEM BACK
AS SOON AS I'VE DISTILLED
THE PHEROMONES FROM YOUR SWEAT.

12:42.232 --> 12:45.135
I'M GOING TO DISCOVER
WHY YOU ATTRACT GIRLS,
AND I DON'T.

12:45.135 --> 12:47.197
BECAUSE YOU BOIL SOCKS.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.901
LOOK, YOU SPY ON EVERYONE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

12:50.901 --> 12:52.402
JUST TELL US
IF YOU'VE SEEN CHLOE.

12:52.402 --> 12:53.944
IT'S GOING TO COST YOU.

12:53.944 --> 12:56.106
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
MY DIRTY GYM SHORTS?

12:56.106 --> 12:58.148
WHY WOULD I WANT ANOTHER
PAIR OF YOUR DIRTY GYM SHORTS?

12:58.148 --> 13:00.510
WHERE ARE YOU
GETTING ALL MY STUFF?

13:02.012 --> 13:04.214
KARL, THIS HAS BEEN
A NICE VISIT, BUT TELL ME,

13:04.214 --> 13:07.818
DO YOU HAVE TEA WITH THE
OTHER MOTHERS ON THE BLOCK?

13:07.818 --> 13:12.292
YES, BUT JOAN'S AND TRACY'S
FINGER SANDWICHES DON'T
HOLD A CANDLE TO YOURS.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.125
AND LOUISE JUST CRIES.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.367
WELL, I HAVE A LOT
OF LAUNDRY TO DO, SO...

13:17.367 --> 13:19.169
YES, I CAN SEE THAT.

13:19.169 --> 13:20.570
ALL RIGHT.

13:20.570 --> 13:22.933
THANKS FOR COMING BY,
KARL. TAKE CARE.

13:22.933 --> 13:25.505
TOODLE-LOO!

13:25.505 --> 13:28.308
THERE IS ONE THING I DO WANT,
THOUGH, THE WATERPARK.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.981
TAKE ME WITH YOU AND I'LL
TELL YOU EVERYTHING
I KNOW ABOUT CHLOE.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.042
YOU'RE BLUFFING.

13:32.042 --> 13:33.143
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CHLOE.

13:33.143 --> 13:34.214
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

13:34.214 --> 13:36.186
I DIDN'T, UNTIL JUST NOW.

13:36.186 --> 13:38.248
I WALKED RIGHT INTO THAT.

13:38.248 --> 13:41.051
THESE TYLER PHEROMONES
MUST BE DULLING MY SENSES.

13:41.051 --> 13:43.223
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS ON GIRLS!

13:43.223 --> 13:45.255
( sighs )
WE'RE LEAVING!

13:45.255 --> 13:47.127
YOU'RE PATHETIC, KARL.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.200
I FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR
WHOLE DESPICABLE FAMILY.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.562
TELL ELLEN I'LL BRING
MY CRANBERRY SCONES TOMORROW.

13:52.562 --> 13:55.165
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

13:57.207 --> 14:00.240
CANDY. CANDY!

14:00.240 --> 14:03.143
COME ON! COME ON!

14:03.143 --> 14:05.916
CANDY?

14:05.916 --> 14:09.349
CANDY! CANDY!

14:09.349 --> 14:11.181
CANDY! AHH!

14:12.182 --> 14:13.884
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

14:13.884 --> 14:15.585
WE LOOKED EVERYWHERE!

14:15.585 --> 14:16.856
I KNOW.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.358
I THINK WE NEED
TO CALL THE POLICE.

14:20.030 --> 14:23.193
HI. UH, YES, I'D LIKE
TO REPORT A MISSING CHILD.

14:23.193 --> 14:28.398
OF COURSE WE'VE LOOKED
EVERYWHERE, WE'RE NOT IDIOTS.

14:28.398 --> 14:29.970
( doorbell )

14:29.970 --> 14:32.342
MAYBE THAT'S HER!
OHH!

14:33.503 --> 14:35.505
OH, IT'S YOU.

14:35.505 --> 14:40.280
WOW. THAT IS THE FIRST TIME
ANYONE'S EVER BEEN
DISAPPOINTED TO SEE ME.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.112
I'M NOT!

14:42.112 --> 14:44.014
BUT WE STILL
HAVEN'T FOUND CHLOE.

14:44.014 --> 14:45.255
I'M REALLY WORRIED.

14:45.255 --> 14:47.257
OHH!

14:47.257 --> 14:49.119
HEY, THAT WAS MINE!

14:49.119 --> 14:50.390
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING BACK HERE?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.491
THE CONCERT JUST ENDED.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.124
OHH! MOM AND DAD WILL
BE HOME ANY SECOND!

14:54.124 --> 14:57.167
NIKKI, CAN YOU GO STALL
OUR PARENTS UNTIL WE FIND CHLOE?

14:57.167 --> 15:00.300
UH, I DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE BEING DECEPTIVE.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.172
I UNDERSTAND IF IT MAKES
YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE--

15:02.172 --> 15:03.273
HA! I GOT YOU!

15:03.273 --> 15:04.434
I WAS BEING
DECEPTIVE RIGHT THEN.

15:04.434 --> 15:06.336
I LOVE BEING DECEPTIVE!

15:06.336 --> 15:08.408
IT'S MY FAVORITE THING,
NEXT TO TELLING THE TRUTH.

15:11.911 --> 15:12.943
Both: AHH!

15:12.943 --> 15:14.314
OH! BRAVO! BRAVO!

15:16.516 --> 15:17.587
WELL, UH...

15:17.587 --> 15:19.649
THAT WAS EMBARRASSING.

15:19.649 --> 15:21.291
YOU KIDDING?

15:21.291 --> 15:23.393
THAT'S THE BEST SLEEP
I'VE HAD SINCE AVERY WAS BORN.

15:23.393 --> 15:24.955
WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN.

15:24.955 --> 15:26.957
YEAH, WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO REPACK.

15:26.957 --> 15:28.258
WE BARELY TOUCHED OUR PICNIC.

15:31.461 --> 15:32.532
OH, MY!

15:32.532 --> 15:33.603
GOODNESS!

15:33.603 --> 15:35.605
WE LET THAT OLD WOMAN
STEAL OUR CHEESE?

15:35.605 --> 15:37.937
SHE CLEARLY WANTED IT MORE.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.272
OH! I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU BOTH!

15:42.272 --> 15:44.274
OH! NIKKI. HI!

15:44.274 --> 15:46.076
DR. JAMES,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

15:46.076 --> 15:47.717
I'VE BEEN HAVING
THIS CRAZY DREAM,

15:47.717 --> 15:49.379
AND IT'S REALLY
DISTURBING ME.

15:49.379 --> 15:51.081
OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

15:51.081 --> 15:53.383
WELL, WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT IT TOMORROW IN MY OFFICE?

15:53.383 --> 15:55.585
BUT WHAT IF I HAVE
THE DREAM AGAIN TONIGHT?

15:55.585 --> 15:58.058
OKAY. WE'LL GO BACK
TO MY OFFICE RIGHT NOW.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.429
NO!

15:59.429 --> 16:01.491
THE DREAM HAPPENS
IN AN OFFICE.

16:01.491 --> 16:04.394
IT'S FILLED WITH...
GEESE.

16:04.394 --> 16:07.967
WELL, THERE'S REALLY
NO REASON I HAVE TO HURRY BACK.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.369
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
THEN, I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.241
NO, STAY!

16:11.241 --> 16:15.345
I FIND YOUR SOOTHING
MATERNAL NATURE...
SO COMFORTING.

16:15.345 --> 16:17.647
OH, AREN'T YOU A DEAR!

16:17.647 --> 16:19.609
HELP THIS GIRL, BENNETT.

16:23.553 --> 16:27.757
REMEMBER HOW CHLOE USED TO WEAR
THE SALAD BOWL LIKE A HAT?

16:27.757 --> 16:32.362
REMEMBER HOW SHE USED TO CALL
HER FEET HER "WALKING HANDS"?

16:32.362 --> 16:36.396
AND HOW I USED TO CALL
MY EYES MY "LOOKING BALLS"?

16:36.396 --> 16:39.529
CHLOE, IS THAT REALLY YOU?

16:39.529 --> 16:41.331
IT'S NOT STAN IN A RED WIG.

16:41.331 --> 16:42.472
THAT'S OVER THERE.

16:42.472 --> 16:46.376
WHY YOU TAKING MY BEANS?

16:46.376 --> 16:47.607
OH, SHE'S HERE.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.241
SOMEONE COULD HAVE TOLD ME.

16:51.241 --> 16:52.512
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE BACK!

16:52.512 --> 16:55.145
I'LL TEXT NIKKI
THAT WE FOUND HER.

16:55.145 --> 16:58.388
AND THEN I LOOKED
DOWN AND I HAD
ORANGE WEBBED FEET

16:58.388 --> 17:03.093
AND AN ELEPHANT TRUNK,
AND I COULD ONLY MAKE
DONKEY SOUNDS.

17:03.093 --> 17:06.356
HEE-HAW, HEE-HAW.

17:06.356 --> 17:07.397
I'M SENSING SOME
DEEP-SEATED TURMOIL.

17:07.397 --> 17:08.358
( phone beeps )

17:08.358 --> 17:09.499
IT MAY TAKE MANY YEARS
OF THERAPY--

17:09.499 --> 17:10.700
THAT'S IT!

17:10.700 --> 17:13.763
THANK YOU, DR. JAMES.
YOU'RE BRILLIANT!

17:13.763 --> 17:14.804
HEY, HONEY. WAKE UP.

17:14.804 --> 17:16.406
I CURED HER.

17:18.768 --> 17:21.211
( raspy ) I WAS SLEEPING
WITH MY MOUTH OPEN.

17:21.211 --> 17:22.672
MY THROAT IS FULL OF ANTS.

17:22.672 --> 17:26.646
( coughing )

17:26.646 --> 17:28.618
WHERE WERE YOU
THIS WHOLE TIME, CHLOE?

17:28.618 --> 17:30.420
NOT EATING CANDY.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.581
( doorbell )

17:31.581 --> 17:32.782
THAT'S PROBABLY THE POLICE.

17:32.782 --> 17:35.555
YOU REALLY HAD US SCARED,
YOU LITTLE CANDY THIEF.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.658
YOU DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN,
YOU'LL BE IN BIG TROUBLE.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.490
HI. WE'RE HERE
ABOUT THE LITTLE GIRL.

17:41.591 --> 17:42.592
BUSTED!

17:44.194 --> 17:46.536
THANK YOU,
FOR COMING SO QUICKLY, OFFICERS.

17:46.536 --> 17:49.068
WE DID HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HER
TODAY, BUT WE FOUND HER.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.140
SO IT'S OKAY.

17:50.140 --> 17:51.441
IT'S GOOD THAT YOU CALLED.

17:51.441 --> 17:52.502
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

17:52.502 --> 17:53.573
I ALWAYS DO.

17:56.446 --> 17:57.547
I GOT TO GO!

17:57.547 --> 17:59.409
THE COPS ARE AFTER ME
FOR BEING A CANDY THIEF!

17:59.409 --> 18:00.410
UH-UH!

18:00.410 --> 18:01.651
YOU'RE NOT GETTING BY ME!

18:01.651 --> 18:03.213
AGAIN.

18:03.213 --> 18:04.454
YOU'RE PART
OF MY PACK, CHLOE.

18:04.454 --> 18:05.555
AND I LOVE YOU.

18:05.555 --> 18:08.518
AND IT'S MY JOB
TO MAKE SURE-- BALL!

18:16.226 --> 18:19.469
WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUTSIDE
BY YOURSELF, YOUNG LADY?

18:19.469 --> 18:23.173
JUST THINKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH I "WUV" YOU.

18:23.173 --> 18:25.635
DID YOU JUST SAY "WUV"?

18:25.635 --> 18:28.478
THAT'S TOO CUTE TO PUNISH,
RIGHT?

18:28.478 --> 18:30.380
NO.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.642
DID TYLER AND AVERY
KNOW YOU WERE OUTSIDE?

18:32.642 --> 18:34.184
NO.

18:34.184 --> 18:35.885
WE'RE GOING TO TEACH
TYLER AND AVERY A LESSON.

18:35.885 --> 18:37.847
I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY
WERE SO IRRESPONSIBLE.

18:37.847 --> 18:40.550
AND YOU, CHLOE,
ARE NOT ALLOWED
OUTSIDE UNSUPERVISED!

18:40.550 --> 18:42.852
DID I MISS
SOMETHING?

18:42.852 --> 18:45.725
CHLOE, WAIT HERE.
WE'LL DEAL WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.228
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME
BIG PUNISHMENT HANDED DOWN HERE.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.362
I DON'T WANT BIG PUNISHMENT.

18:52.362 --> 18:53.363
WHOA WHOA WHOA.

18:53.363 --> 18:55.705
I AM NOT LETTING
YOU LEAVE AGAIN.

18:55.705 --> 18:57.407
AGAIN.

18:57.407 --> 18:59.509
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY HERE,
AND I TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITY

18:59.509 --> 19:02.472
( squeaking )
VERY, VERY-- TOY!

19:04.244 --> 19:07.277
SO, YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING CHLOE
THIS WHOLE TIME, HAVE YOU?

19:07.277 --> 19:09.179
YEAH, SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

19:09.179 --> 19:10.450
UPSTAIRS, IS SHE?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.621
YEAH, I THINK SO.

19:11.621 --> 19:12.682
THINK SO, DO YOU?

19:14.624 --> 19:18.858
WHAT IF I WERE TO TELL YOU WE
FOUND HER OUTSIDE BY HERSELF
WALKING IN THE STREET?

19:18.858 --> 19:21.361
IN THE STREET, WAS SHE?

19:21.361 --> 19:23.863
THERE'S GOING TO BE
SOME BIG PUNISHMENT FOR THIS.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.466
FOR ONE THING,
NO WATERPARK NEXT WEEKEND.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.367
NO, NOT THE WATERPARK.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.569
I REALLY WANT TO GO
TO THE WATERPARK.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.401
I REALLY WANT TO GO
TO THE WATERPARK, TOO.

19:31.401 --> 19:32.542
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I JUST SAID THAT.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.504
WE'RE GOING TO THE WATERPARK.

19:34.504 --> 19:38.508
BUT NO SCREEN TIME FOR A WEEK,
BECAUSE YOU WERE IRRESPONSIBLE.

19:38.508 --> 19:42.212
SO, HOPEFULLY YOU'VE LEARNED
YOUR LESSON AND CAN LEARN
A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM US.

19:42.212 --> 19:44.554
BECAUSE WE KNOW
HOW TO LOOK AFTER SOMEONE.

19:44.554 --> 19:47.387
WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON SOMEONE.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.320
IT MEANS NEVER
LET THEM LEAVE YOUR SIGHT.

19:51.661 --> 19:53.793
ANYONE COULD LOSE SOMEONE.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.296
IT HAPPENS.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.398
YES, I'D LIKE TO REPORT
A LOST CHILD.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.971
OF COURSE WE'VE
LOOKED EVERYWHERE,
WE'RE NOT IDIOTS.

20:01.971 --> 20:04.674
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
WE ARE IDIOTS!

20:04.674 --> 20:05.705
CHLOE!

20:05.705 --> 20:08.878
CHLOE!
DO NOT WANDER OFF LIKE THAT.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.511
HELLO, BLENDED FAMILY.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.484
I FOUND LITTLE RED
WANDERING DOWN THE SIDEWALK.

20:14.484 --> 20:15.545
EATING THIS.

20:15.545 --> 20:19.619
MY FOOD BOX REALLY HURTS.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.552
WELL, THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE A RULE

20:22.552 --> 20:26.456
ABOUT HOW MUCH CANDY
YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR EATIN' HOLE!

20:26.456 --> 20:29.429
RAISINS ARE A HEALTHY
SWEET ALTERNATIVE.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.832
ACCORDING TO MOTHER'S
SPARRING PARTNER, GREGOR.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.535
WELL, THANK YOU, KARL.
HOW CAN WE REPAY YOU?

20:35.535 --> 20:37.507
OH, THE LITTLE GIRL'S SAFETY
IS ALL I CARE--

20:37.507 --> 20:40.440
I WOULD LOVE TO JOIN YOU
FOR THE WATERPARK NEXT WEEKEND.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.912
OKAY. SOUNDS GREAT.

20:42.912 --> 20:44.514
Avery and Tyler:
NO!

20:44.514 --> 20:47.246
WE CAN DISCUSS THE DETAILS
TOMORROW, OVER TEA.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.278
WHAT?

20:48.278 --> 20:50.620
OH, SOMETIMES
KARL AND I HAVE TEA.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.481
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

20:53.383 --> 20:55.525
SO, I STILL GET PAID
FOR BABYSITTING, RIGHT?

20:55.525 --> 20:57.627
( all laughing )

20:59.529 --> 21:00.590
CLASSIC!

21:05.735 --> 21:08.938
I GUESS NONE OF US
WERE VERY RESPONSIBLE THAT DAY.

21:08.938 --> 21:11.901
BUT WE PUT THAT BEHIND US THE
NEXT WEEKEND AT THE WATERPARK,

21:11.901 --> 21:15.975
AND WE ALL HAD FUN!

21:15.975 --> 21:19.979
EXCEPT FOR TYLER AND AVERY.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.682
AND WE WERE VERY RESPONSIBLE,
TOO.

21:22.682 --> 21:26.516
UNTIL WE LOST CHLOE.

21:26.516 --> 21:28.818
THANK GOODNESS
FOR THE GONZALEZ FAMILY.

21:28.818 --> 21:33.893
NOW THEY KNOW
HOW TO BE RESPONSIBLE.
