18:18.138 --> 18:21.599
Dear me.
He's very small.

Mrs. Sowerberry.
He'll grow.

18:26.521 --> 18:29.482
I daresay he will.

and our drink!

18:32.736 --> 18:34.111

Mother came to us destitute.

into the world,

18:36.948 --> 18:38.468

and promptly dies

18:38.533 --> 18:40.910
without leaving so much
as a forwarding
name and address.

18:40.994 --> 18:45.247
So here he is,
yours for three guineas,
as agreed. Cash on delivery.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.957
Oh, no.
No, Mr. Bumble, no, no.

18:47.042 --> 18:50.294

18:53.381 --> 18:55.382
then we'll keep him.
But he's...

18:55.467 --> 18:57.904
He can help Noah Claypole
put the shutters up.
Do you hear, now?

18:57.928 --> 18:59.248
Then he can clean
out the stables,

18:59.304 --> 19:00.573
fill the lamps
and sweep the yard.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.139
I'll look after him, missus.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.350
You see, my dear,
it occurred to me

19:04.434 --> 19:06.769
that he'd make
a delightful
coffin-follower.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.731
That, uh...
That expression
of melancholy.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.710
It's very interesting,
don't you think so, my love?

19:12.734 --> 19:13.818
Hmm.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.195
I don't mean
a regular coffin-follower

19:16.279 --> 19:18.823

no, no, no,

19:18.907 --> 19:22.535

Precisely. A superb effect,
don't you think so, my love?

19:29.376 --> 19:33.212
Mmm. Do you think you could look
like that gentleman up there?

19:36.091 --> 19:39.426
Perhaps, if I had a tall hat.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.041

21:10.685 --> 21:13.520
What did she die of?
Shortage of breath?

21:17.442 --> 21:20.444
You'd better
not say anything
about her to me.

21:20.528 --> 21:22.947
Don't you be cheeky, workhouse.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.658

21:25.742 --> 21:28.285

bad one, she was.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.621
What did you say?

21:30.705 --> 21:32.265
It's a good thing
she died when she did,

21:32.290 --> 21:34.875
'cause she'd been in prison
doing hard labor...

21:37.379 --> 21:38.963
Help! Help!

23:18.104 --> 23:20.189
Do you know this
here voice, Oliver?

23:20.273 --> 23:21.690
Yes, I do!

23:21.775 --> 23:23.776
Well, ain't you
afraid of it, Oliver?

23:23.860 --> 23:26.403
Ain't you a-trembling
when I speak, Oliver?

23:26.488 --> 23:27.946
No, I'm not!

23:29.657 --> 23:31.033
He's gone mad, Mr. Bumble.

23:31.117 --> 23:32.910
Or he wouldn't
dare to speak
to you like that.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.620
It's not madness,
ma'am, it's meat.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.704
Meat?

23:35.747 --> 23:38.832
Meat, ma'am, meat!
You overfed the boy, ma'am.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.561
You've raised an artificial
spirit in the lad

23:40.585 --> 23:42.586
unbecoming to his
station in life.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.798
This would never have happened
if you kept him on gruel.
Gruel?

23:45.882 --> 23:48.467
I'll be glad to
give you the recipe.

23:48.551 --> 23:51.178

Mr. Bumble?

23:51.262 --> 23:52.638
He's sitting on Oliver.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.765
Quite right.
We must all
sit on Oliver.

23:54.849 --> 23:57.017
You been drinking again?

Help!

24:02.690 --> 24:04.525
Who's in there?

24:04.609 --> 24:07.528
That coffin should
not have been occupied
until tomorrow.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.364
It's reserved for
a very important client.

24:10.448 --> 24:11.615
Stand back!

24:14.202 --> 24:16.620
Now, then.
What's your explanation,
you young scallywag?

24:16.704 --> 24:17.830
He called my mum a name.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.998
And what if he did,
you ungrateful
little wretch?

24:20.083 --> 24:22.042
She deserved what
he said and worse.

24:22.168 --> 24:23.252
She didn't!
She did!

24:23.336 --> 24:25.129
It's a lie!
Hold your tongue, boy!

24:25.213 --> 24:27.483
Put him down in the cellar,
Mr. Bumble. That'll teach him.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.091

Yes!

Waiting, my dear? What for?

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:36.767
Bill will give you what-for
if you don't fork out.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:39.186
Now come on, hand over.
Start counting.

01:12:39.312 --> 01:12:40.957

wouldn't you say?

You couldn't do it

01:20:43.087 --> 01:20:46.173
Yes! Well, I saw him
running away.

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:49.676
Why didn't you look after him?

01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:51.595
Why didn't you bring
him back with you?

01:20:51.679 --> 01:20:52.846
How can I help it?

01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:54.765
A fine thing,
Oliver in the lockup.

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.410
And in the morning
he's up in front of the beak!

01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:57.518
For pinching a wallet.

01:20:57.602 --> 01:20:59.042
So he goes to jail.
What's it matter?

01:20:59.103 --> 01:21:00.521
I'm afraid he may say something

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:02.189
which will get us into trouble.

01:21:02.273 --> 01:21:04.316
That's very likely, Fagin.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.193
You see, you're blowed upon.

01:21:11.783 --> 01:21:13.367
And I'm afraid, you see,

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:18.455
that if the game was up with us,

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.376
it might be up
with a good many more.

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:25.963
And it would come out
rather worse for you

01:21:27.131 --> 01:21:29.299
than it would for me.

01:21:34.138 --> 01:21:39.226
Why, you miserable,
sneaking, treacherous old...

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:41.436
No, Bill!

01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:43.730
You go down to that
court in the morning

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:46.066
and you will find
out what happens.

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:50.821
Me? Go to court?

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:53.448
With a magistrate sitting there?

01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:56.451
I'll go.
They won't know me.

01:21:56.536 --> 01:22:00.289
Good girl. Clever girl.

01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:03.458
And if he does talk,
you'll come and tell us
quick, eh, Nancy? Quick!

01:22:03.543 --> 01:22:06.920
'Cause then we'll have
to look after ourselves,
won't we?

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:10.591
You won't have to look
after yourself, Fagin.

01:22:11.175 --> 01:22:13.594
'Cause I'll look
after you, believe me.

01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:16.388
I always believe you, Bill.

01:22:16.472 --> 01:22:18.432
Have another drink.

01:22:27.483 --> 01:22:30.277
Silence. Silence in court.

01:22:59.807 --> 01:23:02.976
Well? What crime is
this one charged with?

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:05.854
He looks a thoroughbred
old reprobate to me.

01:23:05.938 --> 01:23:07.981
Speak up, man!
What's he charged with?

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:10.150
He's not charged at all,
Your Worship.

01:23:10.234 --> 01:23:12.319
This gentlemen appears
against the boy.

01:23:12.403 --> 01:23:15.489
Mmm? Boy?
What boy? I see no boy.

01:23:15.573 --> 01:23:17.532
The boy in the dock,
Your Worship.

01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:18.617
Mmm?

01:23:19.577 --> 01:23:22.162
Oh, yes. Stand up, boy,
I can't see you!

01:23:22.246 --> 01:23:23.664
He is standing up, Your Worship.

01:23:23.748 --> 01:23:24.998
Don't be impertinent!

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:26.917
Put him on a box or something.

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:32.214
Well, what's he charged with?

01:23:32.298 --> 01:23:35.050
Picking pockets, sir.

01:23:35.134 --> 01:23:36.718
What's your name, boy?

01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:39.388
Oliver.

01:23:39.472 --> 01:23:40.555
Hmm.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.058
And does your father
know you're here?

01:23:45.061 --> 01:23:46.186
Hmm?

01:23:48.981 --> 01:23:50.273
I'm an orphan.

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.067
He says he's an orphan, sir.

01:23:53.069 --> 01:23:54.569
And where do you come from?

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:58.240
Where do you live?

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:01.410
Who looks after you?

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:16.717
He doesn't seem able
to say where he lives,
or anything else, sir.

01:24:18.094 --> 01:24:19.344
Well.

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:23.765
A liar as well as a thief, eh?

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:25.392
And insolent into the bargain.

01:24:25.476 --> 01:24:26.643
Well, that settles it.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:29.730
The boy is committed
to three months
with hard labor.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.400
This is disgraceful!
I demand to be heard.

01:24:33.484 --> 01:24:35.569
- You have not yet...
- Sir, I was there!

01:24:35.653 --> 01:24:38.488
What's this disturbance?
Remove this lunatic!
Clear the court!

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:41.908
I will speak!
I saw what happened.
It was outside my shop.

01:24:41.993 --> 01:24:44.244
Two other boys stole
Mr. Brownlow's wallet.

01:24:44.328 --> 01:24:46.246
This child had
nothing to do with it.

01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:48.582
But sentence has been passed!

01:24:49.792 --> 01:24:51.460
Hasn't it?

01:25:00.511 --> 01:25:02.846
He didn't talk.
Case was dismissed.

01:25:03.681 --> 01:25:05.432
What a greatjudge!

01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:07.934
Fetch the boy.

01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:09.519
I've done my share.

01:25:17.403 --> 01:25:18.779
Where are we going?

01:25:18.863 --> 01:25:20.447
At least I can make some amends.

01:25:20.531 --> 01:25:23.074
You're coming home with me.
Jump in.

01:25:29.707 --> 01:25:32.417
Dodger! After them!
Let the kid go!

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:35.212
He can still blab
on us, can't he?
Leave him be!

01:25:36.756 --> 01:25:39.049
Dodger! Don't lose him!

Boy's gone, sir.
Can I take them for you?

I know where the shop is.
Please let me take them.
I'll be very quick.

01:47:12.884 --> 01:47:16.595
All right. Mrs. Bedwin,
the books are on the
table beside my bed.

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:20.599
Now, then, Oliver.
You'll take those
books to Mr. Jessop

01:47:20.683 --> 01:47:24.436
and tell him you
have come to pay
the £4.10 that I owe him.

01:47:24.521 --> 01:47:28.107

Yes.

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:54.049
I'll take the books for you.

Don't you?

01:48:05.728 --> 01:48:07.729
If he does,
I'll eat me head,

a likeness to the lad?

Well, that's your niece,
isn't it?

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.528
That's what I mean.

01:48:14.612 --> 01:48:16.446
Wasn't she the girl who...

01:48:17.699 --> 01:48:18.991
Who ran away.

A young, innocent face,
nothing more.

01:48:21.077 --> 01:48:22.661
Mere coincidence.

I'm not so sure.

01:48:24.956 --> 01:48:28.375

What did you
tell him about us?
Nothing!

01:51:47.283 --> 01:51:51.620
Fagin, I'll wager
this young rat's
told him everything.

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:53.872
What did you tell him?

01:52:24.028 --> 01:52:28.031
Such talent! Such a joker!
You take care I don't
overdo it, Fagin,

01:52:28.699 --> 01:52:30.094

on all of you,

01:52:30.118 --> 01:52:32.828

if I hang for it!

01:52:35.164 --> 01:52:38.583
Do you know who you are?
And what you are?

01:52:38.668 --> 01:52:40.377
You don't have to tell me.

01:52:40.503 --> 01:52:44.047
A fine one for the boy
to make a friend of.
Yes, I am, God help me!

01:52:45.466 --> 01:52:49.678
And I wish I'd been struck down dead
before I laid a hand
to bring him back here.

01:52:49.762 --> 01:52:53.014
From tonight he's a liar
and a thief,

01:52:53.099 --> 01:52:55.517
and all that's bad.

01:52:55.601 --> 01:52:58.645
Ain't that enough for you
without beating him to death?

01:52:58.729 --> 01:53:04.985
Come, come, Sikes.
We must have civil words.
Civil words.

01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:08.029
Oh, yes, you deserve them
from me, don't you?

01:53:08.114 --> 01:53:11.074
I thieved for you
when I was half his age.

01:53:11.159 --> 01:53:13.952
And it's your dirty work
I've been doing ever since.

01:53:14.036 --> 01:53:15.716
Well, if you have,
it's a living, isn't it?

01:53:15.746 --> 01:53:18.039
He's right, Nancy.
A living is a living.

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:20.584
Some living! Lord help me!

01:53:20.668 --> 01:53:22.335
Some living!

01:53:23.004 --> 01:53:25.005
Get to bed, all of you.

01:53:26.215 --> 01:53:29.217
Get to bed, I said!

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:33.138
All this violence,
all these scenes,
screams, dramas!

01:53:33.222 --> 01:53:36.057
I'm asking you, is it necessary?

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.394
Not yet, Fagin.

01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:42.147
Not yet.

01:53:42.231 --> 01:53:46.651
But if this godforsaken
little good-for-nothing's
uttered one word,

01:53:46.736 --> 01:53:48.320
one word, mind you...

01:53:48.404 --> 01:53:50.989
If he has, the little devil,

01:53:51.073 --> 01:53:53.533
we sit down,
we talk it over,
we think it out,

01:53:53.618 --> 01:53:55.869
we decide upon
a proper course of safe action,

01:53:55.953 --> 01:53:58.580
we stay calm!

01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:01.333
Do we?

01:54:01.417 --> 01:54:07.214
And while we're sitting here
thinking, and talking,
and staying calm,

01:54:07.298 --> 01:54:09.549
our collars get felt, don't they?

01:54:09.634 --> 01:54:12.511
And it's,
"Come along with me,
if you please."

01:54:13.596 --> 01:54:15.096
No, thank you very much.

01:54:15.765 --> 01:54:18.183
Look, you thought us
into this little lot.

01:54:18.267 --> 01:54:21.686
You can think
your way out of it.

01:54:21.771 --> 01:54:26.107
But from now on,
Bill Sikes takes the law
into his own hands.

01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:29.110
These hands.

01:54:30.404 --> 01:54:35.951
Have you ever heard the sound
a chicken makes when they're
wringing off its neck?

01:54:38.704 --> 01:54:40.622
Can't say I ever had the...

01:54:40.706 --> 01:54:42.541
They squawks, Fagin.

01:54:43.668 --> 01:54:45.293
They squawks.

01:54:46.128 --> 01:54:50.298
Not a very pretty sound.
No, Bill.

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:53.718
And then they dies, don't they?

01:54:54.971 --> 01:54:58.098
Yes, Bill. I mean, no, Bill.

01:54:58.182 --> 01:55:03.103
Then they say some
even start squawking
before that event.

01:55:03.187 --> 01:55:07.315
They get what you might call
a premonition.

01:55:08.317 --> 01:55:12.362
Now, then,
you wouldn't be
having no premonition

01:55:12.446 --> 01:55:14.739
of that sort by any chance,
would you?

01:55:15.866 --> 01:55:19.411
Not me, Bill.
The lips are sealed.

01:55:20.329 --> 01:55:22.038
I'm glad.

01:55:22.123 --> 01:55:26.167
'Cause if anyone here
should lead the law to me,

01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:28.878
and I gets to hear of it,

01:55:28.963 --> 01:55:31.548

♪ I think I'd better

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:44.629
And so, sir,
the instant I received
your communication

02:01:44.713 --> 02:01:45.857
regarding dear little Oliver,

02:01:45.881 --> 02:01:47.801
I decided we must take
the first coach to London.

02:01:47.925 --> 02:01:50.510
I decided.
That's right, sir,
my dear wife decided.

02:01:50.594 --> 02:01:51.803
It was good of you to come.

02:01:51.887 --> 02:01:53.638
Now, what have you
got to tell me?

02:01:53.722 --> 02:01:56.140
This locket,
sir, once belonged
to the boy's mother.

02:01:56.225 --> 02:01:58.977
Found by the wife
after she passed away.

02:01:59.061 --> 02:02:01.312
The boy's mother,
that is, not my dear wife.

02:02:13.575 --> 02:02:15.827
You've kept this
all these years?

02:02:15.911 --> 02:02:17.328
Why should I not?

02:02:17.413 --> 02:02:20.999
Did it not occur to you
that this might provide the answer
to the boy's parentage?

02:02:21.083 --> 02:02:23.001
His identity? His very name?

02:02:23.085 --> 02:02:25.420
But he had no name, sir.
The mother was unmarried.

02:02:25.504 --> 02:02:29.340
It was your clear duty
to show this evidence
to some higher authority.

02:02:29.425 --> 02:02:30.785
Your behavior, madam,
was shameful!

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:34.846
How dare you speak to me so?
I only came here to help you.

02:02:34.930 --> 02:02:37.849
You came here to profit
from your own greed
and dishonesty.

02:02:37.933 --> 02:02:40.578
Sir, if you think
the locket don't properly
belong to my dear wife...

02:02:40.602 --> 02:02:42.270
Be quiet,
you old fool!
Here. Your reward.

02:02:42.354 --> 02:02:43.855
And something for the locket.
Take it.

02:02:43.939 --> 02:02:45.250
Think yourselves lucky
you're not in the hands
of the law.

02:02:45.274 --> 02:02:46.774
Mrs. Bedwin,
show these people out.

02:02:46.859 --> 02:02:48.776
There's gratitude for you!

02:02:51.113 --> 02:02:53.406
I hope this unfortunate
little circumstance

02:02:53.490 --> 02:02:55.199
won't deprive me of
my parochial office?

02:02:55.284 --> 02:02:57.201
My hope, sir, is that it will.

02:02:57.286 --> 02:02:58.786
But it was all
Mrs. Bumble, sir.

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:00.371
I knew nothing of
it until yesterday.

02:03:00.456 --> 02:03:02.165
That's no excuse.
In the eyes of the law,

02:03:02.249 --> 02:03:03.958
you are the more
guilty of the two.

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:07.128
For the law supposes
that your wife acts
under your direction.

02:03:07.212 --> 02:03:10.131
If that's what
the law supposes, sir,
then the law's an ass!

02:03:10.215 --> 02:03:13.051
If that's the eye
of the law, sir,
then law is a bachelor!

02:03:13.135 --> 02:03:16.971
And the worst I wish
the law is that its eye
may be opened by experience!

02:03:17.056 --> 02:03:18.973
By experience, sir!

02:03:28.984 --> 02:03:32.653
Sir, the locket,
I didn't really see...

02:03:32.738 --> 02:03:38.576
I recognized it at once.
I gave it to my niece, Emily,
on her 18th birthday.

02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:42.747
So it wasn'tjust her
young man jilting her
that made her run away?

02:03:42.831 --> 02:03:44.916
No.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.337
She must have made her
way to that workhouse
and had her baby there.

02:04:24.748 --> 02:04:26.499
What's going on?

02:04:27.918 --> 02:04:29.460
Why have you
brought the boy here?

02:04:29.545 --> 02:04:31.379
'Cause he's coming on a job

02:04:32.714 --> 02:04:33.631
with me.

02:04:33.715 --> 02:04:35.842
But why him?

02:04:37.219 --> 02:04:39.220
'Cause I need a little one.

02:04:40.013 --> 02:04:41.180
That's why.

02:04:41.849 --> 02:04:43.641
And he's nice and thin.

02:04:43.725 --> 02:04:48.354
And on this particularjob,
that's what counts.

02:04:49.857 --> 02:04:51.149
Must I go?

02:04:51.233 --> 02:04:56.320
One word out of you
while you're out with me

02:04:56.405 --> 02:04:58.156
and you know what will happen.

02:05:06.165 --> 02:05:07.665
Bill, you can't do this to him.

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.459
Please! You can't!

02:05:10.586 --> 02:05:12.837
I won't let you...
We'll have
no more of that.

02:05:17.968 --> 02:05:20.178
You just be at
the tavern at 11:00.

02:05:44.161 --> 02:05:45.745
Bull's-eye.

02:06:18.695 --> 02:06:19.904
I've come about Oliver.

02:06:19.988 --> 02:06:21.174
Look, could you tell Brownlow...

02:06:21.198 --> 02:06:22.467
You better come inside.
Mr. Brownlow!

02:06:22.491 --> 02:06:23.741
No. Don't call him.

02:06:23.825 --> 02:06:25.105
I just want to
leave a message...

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:26.410
But he'll want to see you.

02:06:26.495 --> 02:06:27.912
Please! I can't stay!

02:06:27.996 --> 02:06:29.349
Sir, this person says
that she wants to...

02:06:29.373 --> 02:06:31.457
Who is it?
It's about
the boy, sir.

02:06:31.541 --> 02:06:32.667
Is there news of him?

02:06:32.751 --> 02:06:34.252
He's in danger.
In bad company.

02:06:34.336 --> 02:06:36.712
He was dragged off
the day you sent him
out with them books.

02:06:36.797 --> 02:06:39.006
Who took him?
Me and someone else.

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.508
You took him by force?

02:06:40.592 --> 02:06:42.093
Yes!

02:06:42.177 --> 02:06:44.072
And God help me,
I wish now I'd
never been part of it.

02:06:44.096 --> 02:06:45.304
But where is he now?

02:06:45.389 --> 02:06:47.056
And who is this other
person you speak of?

02:06:47.182 --> 02:06:48.701
Can you take me to him?
No, no, I can't.

02:06:48.725 --> 02:06:50.536
You want to help
the boy, don't you?
Why else are you here?

02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.664
Yes, I do want
to help him, but...
Then tell me where he is!

02:06:52.688 --> 02:06:53.938
I can't!

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.108
But I'll bring him to you.

02:06:57.192 --> 02:06:58.609
Not here. It's too far.

02:06:58.694 --> 02:07:00.069
Where, then?

02:07:01.029 --> 02:07:02.196
The bridge.

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:04.865
London Bridge,
tonight at midnight.

02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:06.617
But you've got to come alone.

02:07:06.702 --> 02:07:08.369
Promise you'll come on your own!

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:12.206
You don't trust me, do you?

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:14.166
But you've got to.

02:07:16.586 --> 02:07:18.212
I'll be there.

02:07:18.297 --> 02:07:20.464
Thank God. Now let me go.

02:07:20.549 --> 02:07:23.342
Wait! Is the boy hurt?
Ill-treated? If so, I shall...

02:07:23.427 --> 02:07:26.137
I can't say no more.
Please!

02:07:26.221 --> 02:07:27.888
He'll kill me as it
is if he finds out.

02:07:28.557 --> 02:07:30.057
Who is this man?

02:07:30.142 --> 02:07:31.600
No, I won't tell you!

02:07:33.061 --> 02:07:35.730
Whatever else I do,
I won't turn on him.

02:07:40.193 --> 02:07:42.111
You wouldn't understand.

02:07:46.575 --> 02:07:51.412
I've got to go back.
I want to go back.

02:07:55.375 --> 02:07:56.584
Promise you'll come?

02:07:56.668 --> 02:07:57.918
At 12:00.

02:08:30.911 --> 02:08:32.828
Now, you remember,
you little worm.

02:08:32.913 --> 02:08:33.954
The front door.

02:08:47.135 --> 02:08:48.552
Psst!

02:08:48.637 --> 02:08:50.221
There.

02:09:40.355 --> 02:09:41.397
Hurry!

02:09:49.739 --> 02:09:51.240
Look above you.

02:10:36.912 --> 02:10:39.205
Who is it? Who's there?

02:10:39.289 --> 02:10:42.208
Rufus! Jenkins!
Come on down. Seize him!

02:10:48.089 --> 02:10:49.924
Seize him! Seize him!
Good dogs!

02:11:31.675 --> 02:11:35.135
Why worry, my dear?
He always turns up!

02:11:39.099 --> 02:11:43.227
Maybe he's taken
Oliver back to my place.

02:11:43.311 --> 02:11:44.979
He said he was
coming straight here.

02:11:45.063 --> 02:11:46.564
Then that is what he will do!

02:12:00.829 --> 02:12:02.371
Everything all right, Bill?

02:12:03.456 --> 02:12:05.124
No, it's not, Fagin.

02:12:05.208 --> 02:12:08.919
The little brat
woke them up.
We had to run for it.

02:12:09.004 --> 02:12:11.714
- Anybody see you?
- No.

02:12:17.637 --> 02:12:20.514
I'll just take the boy
and put him to bed.
I'll be back.

02:12:20.599 --> 02:12:22.516
Oi.

02:12:24.311 --> 02:12:25.811
Put him back.

02:12:35.614 --> 02:12:37.031
Bull's-eye.

02:12:37.782 --> 02:12:38.991
Bull's-eye?

02:12:39.075 --> 02:12:42.578
Bull's-eye,
watch him, will you?
Go on, watch him!

There! You see him?

02:18:05.652 --> 02:18:07.693
Now go on. Quick!

02:18:11.657 --> 02:18:13.157

You come here, Bull's-eye.

02:19:21.269 --> 02:19:24.438
Bull's-eye.
You come here, Bull's-eye.

02:19:25.189 --> 02:19:28.275
They've seen you, Bull's-eye.
So you can't come
with me no further.

02:19:29.610 --> 02:19:33.280
'Cause if you do,
they'll know you,
Bull's-eye.

02:19:34.156 --> 02:19:37.450
Come on.
You ain't afraid of me,
are you, Bull's-eye?

02:19:38.786 --> 02:19:40.412
Bull's-eye, you come here.

02:19:42.123 --> 02:19:43.915
Come here, Bull's-eye!

02:19:45.584 --> 02:19:48.795
Bull's-eye!

02:19:51.966 --> 02:19:53.884
You see anyone about?

02:19:53.968 --> 02:19:55.218
I don't know.

02:19:55.303 --> 02:19:56.970
I thought I saw someone running.

02:19:59.682 --> 02:20:02.350
Here, that dog
was here just now.

02:20:03.311 --> 02:20:05.479
Wait a moment,
I think I know.
Bull's-eye?

02:20:05.563 --> 02:20:09.274
That's Bull's-eye, Bill Sikes's dog.
They're always around together.

02:20:09.358 --> 02:20:12.903
If anyone can find
Sikes for you, he can.

02:20:13.029 --> 02:20:15.906
Bull's-eye? Come on, Bull's-eye.
Come on, boy.
Come on, fella.

02:20:31.214 --> 02:20:32.297
Psst!

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:47.646
Brass! I want some brass!
I've got to get away.

02:20:47.730 --> 02:20:49.147
What's wrong, Bill?

02:20:49.232 --> 02:20:52.025
Do you understand?
I want brass.
Brass! Money!

02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:57.823
There's...
There's blood
on your coat.

02:21:00.993 --> 02:21:03.036
Where's Nancy?
Hmm?

02:21:03.704 --> 02:21:05.288
Bill?

02:21:05.373 --> 02:21:08.667
Bill Sikes, what did you do?

02:21:09.544 --> 02:21:11.044
What did you do?

02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:14.881
She won't peach
on nobody no more.

02:21:17.593 --> 02:21:20.554
You shouldn't have done that.

02:21:22.557 --> 02:21:25.225
She peached?
Are you sure?

02:21:25.309 --> 02:21:27.269
Well, she must have done,
mustn't she?

02:21:27.895 --> 02:21:30.647
She was handing the boy over
to Brownlow on the bridge.

02:21:30.731 --> 02:21:32.524
He was there, waiting for her.

02:21:32.608 --> 02:21:34.276
Then what did you come here for?

02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:36.486
Get out! Do you hear me?
Get out!

02:21:36.571 --> 02:21:37.904
I want money!

02:21:39.157 --> 02:21:42.868
How much? 10? 20?

02:21:43.411 --> 02:21:44.411
No!
All of it.

02:21:44.495 --> 02:21:46.663
If anyone at all
should come here
asking for me...

02:21:46.747 --> 02:21:48.206
They won't find me here.

02:21:48.291 --> 02:21:50.851
You don't think I'm
going to stand here
and wait for them, do you?

02:21:53.254 --> 02:21:54.754
It's him.

02:21:56.424 --> 02:21:57.757
Bull's-eye.

02:22:06.017 --> 02:22:08.018
Quick, boys! All of you!

02:22:08.102 --> 02:22:10.645
We're changing lodgings!

02:22:16.694 --> 02:22:18.612
Nancy, I loved you, didn't I?

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:20.572
Look what you've done to me.

02:22:25.661 --> 02:22:29.915
Bill! Why make things worse?
Leave him!

02:22:29.999 --> 02:22:31.791
It's me they're after!

02:22:31.876 --> 02:22:34.628
But they won't go for me.
Not with the boy close,
they won't.

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:36.296
So you keep out of it!

02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:38.965
Out the back way. Come on!

02:23:07.495 --> 02:23:09.162
Look! Up there!

02:23:09.247 --> 02:23:12.916
It's him! It's Bill Sikes!
It's him for sure!

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:14.876
And the boy!

02:23:15.628 --> 02:23:17.587

waiting for you, Sikes!

02:23:37.733 --> 02:23:40.110
Get back! Get back!

02:24:30.661 --> 02:24:32.454
Don't bother with that.
Get out of it.

02:24:32.538 --> 02:24:35.206
Hey, Fagin, what do I do?
Live up to your name,
Dodger.

02:24:35.291 --> 02:24:37.542
Dodge about.
