00:00.024 --> 00:01.414
Previously on Legacies...

00:01.417 --> 00:03.282
You know, I opened this
school to protect these kids.

00:03.284 --> 00:04.884
How am I supposed to protect them

00:04.887 --> 00:07.995
from stuff that's not supposed to exist?

00:07.998 --> 00:10.366
Hell, they even make rules
about how we're supposed to eat

00:10.369 --> 00:12.240
but they don't tell us what
they're actually feeding us.

00:12.242 --> 00:14.914
There's blood bags in that
refrigerator right there.

00:14.917 --> 00:16.361
But not human blood!

00:16.363 --> 00:17.963
I killed my girlfriend.

00:17.965 --> 00:20.259
I was behind the wheel
and I lost control.

00:20.262 --> 00:22.082
When I woke up, I was in the hospital,

00:22.085 --> 00:23.902
and I don't know anything else.

00:23.904 --> 00:25.025
Are you happy?

00:25.028 --> 00:27.137
I am happy right now.

00:27.140 --> 00:30.475
In the arms of my
demon-possessed baby mama.

00:30.477 --> 00:32.110
DORIAN The monsters come one at a time.

00:32.113 --> 00:33.645
I found myself not far from here

00:33.647 --> 00:35.480
with an urge to possess that knife.

00:35.482 --> 00:36.815
And who told you to do this?

00:36.817 --> 00:38.984
The Necromancer.

00:38.986 --> 00:40.719
If you're the one responsible

00:40.721 --> 00:42.578
for what went down today,

00:42.581 --> 00:44.456
you're gonna wish you were someone else.

01:07.032 --> 01:09.015
I'm no stranger to death,

01:09.018 --> 01:11.149
but that doesn't mean
I want to talk about it.

01:11.151 --> 01:12.281
"Dear Grandma,

01:12.284 --> 01:15.819
I've been thinking of you,
wishing you were here."

01:15.822 --> 01:18.023
Once a year for Remembrance Day,

01:18.026 --> 01:21.058
we're asked to write letters
to our lost loved ones.

01:21.061 --> 01:23.895
Dear Cassie, I miss you every day.

01:23.897 --> 01:25.730
We sign our names, fold them up,

01:25.732 --> 01:27.532
and scatter them
throughout the cemetery.

01:32.698 --> 01:34.473
I usually don't see the point in it.

01:34.476 --> 01:36.841
Why write to the dead?

01:43.350 --> 01:45.570
I'd rather not think about it at all.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.996
Except lately...

01:48.999 --> 01:52.467
Death keeps knocking on my door.

02:03.103 --> 02:04.602
Cassie?

02:04.604 --> 02:06.703
Raf.

02:06.706 --> 02:08.628
Cassie? Isn't that your...?

02:08.632 --> 02:09.874
My girlfriend.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.165
Was that really necessary?

02:34.167 --> 02:35.820
I told you I need answers.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.269
Why would I help you?
You have me in chains.

02:38.271 --> 02:41.187
This indignity will not go unpunished.

02:41.190 --> 02:43.054
We have been at this for days.

02:43.057 --> 02:45.676
Answer my questions, or
I'm gonna peel your skin off

02:45.679 --> 02:48.223
like a grape and shower
you with battery acid.

02:48.226 --> 02:50.848
A rather grotesque effort,

02:50.851 --> 02:52.406
considering it will feel like

02:52.409 --> 02:54.692
the delicate tickle of a feather.

02:58.091 --> 03:00.258
All right.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.594
Let's see how this feels.

03:03.268 --> 03:05.829
Dr. Saltzman.

03:05.832 --> 03:08.767
Oh, there you are, lovely girl.

03:08.769 --> 03:11.369
I was wondering if you'd
come visit me again.

03:11.371 --> 03:13.062
How's your friend,

03:13.065 --> 03:14.539
the one I saw you with earlier,

03:14.541 --> 03:17.325
trying to steal an illicit peek at me?

03:17.328 --> 03:19.262
As we speak, he's having
an emotional reunion

03:19.265 --> 03:20.745
with his dead girlfriend.

03:20.747 --> 03:22.106
I assume we have you to thank?

03:22.109 --> 03:23.548
Poor dear.

03:23.550 --> 03:27.585
Her spirit was clinging to
him like a vine in winter.

03:27.587 --> 03:29.117
It took barely any effort.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.523
Just a little wrinkle
of the nose, and poof.

03:31.525 --> 03:33.324
Young love reborn.

03:33.326 --> 03:36.127
You're lucky that's all I did.

03:36.129 --> 03:38.763
The way you've treated
a man of my stature,

03:38.765 --> 03:40.098
you should be ashamed.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.634
Literally nobody knows who you are.

03:42.636 --> 03:45.036
That's impossible.

03:45.038 --> 03:48.173
I'll check on Raf.

03:48.175 --> 03:50.241
I-If you want an end to this misery,

03:50.243 --> 03:52.110
simply bring me the knife

03:52.112 --> 03:53.578
and I'll be

03:53.580 --> 03:55.547
- on my way...
- Hope!

03:59.825 --> 04:02.092
Oh...

04:02.095 --> 04:03.695
I take it things aren't going well?

04:03.698 --> 04:05.131
- He's a diva.
- So what's the plan?

04:05.134 --> 04:06.541
I know you don't want
to give over the knife,

04:06.543 --> 04:08.303
but we can't have him
raising the lost loved ones

04:08.305 --> 04:09.772
of every person in this school.

04:09.775 --> 04:11.588
I will handle it. I have
questions that need answers.

04:11.590 --> 04:13.311
Okay, well, I'm not sure your
methods are the most effective.

04:13.313 --> 04:15.333
Hope. I said I will handle it.

04:15.335 --> 04:17.067
Now, just stay away from him.

04:23.176 --> 04:24.642
Cassie,

04:24.644 --> 04:25.777
is it?

04:25.779 --> 04:27.779
Cassie, I'm Dr. Saltzman.

04:27.781 --> 04:29.380
I am here to help you.

04:29.382 --> 04:32.350
I... I don't understand
what's happening.

04:32.352 --> 04:33.985
Why am I here?

04:33.987 --> 04:35.987
I didn't know what to tell her.

04:35.989 --> 04:38.389
Um, well, do you mind telling me

04:38.391 --> 04:40.692
the last few things that you remember?

04:40.694 --> 04:42.026
Um...

04:42.028 --> 04:44.696
Raf and I were driving
home from a track meet.

04:44.698 --> 04:48.933
The roads were bad, it
was wet, and then dark,

04:48.935 --> 04:51.736
and I heard this voice
telling me to open up my eyes,

04:51.738 --> 04:53.338
and then I was here.

04:54.708 --> 04:56.808
Okay. Well, listen, this
is gonna be really hard

04:56.810 --> 04:58.176
for you to understand,

04:58.178 --> 04:59.377
but...

04:59.379 --> 05:01.145
those memories you have,

05:01.147 --> 05:03.248
those are from two months ago.

05:03.250 --> 05:06.731
You were in a car accident.

05:06.734 --> 05:08.253
You didn't survive.

05:08.255 --> 05:10.255
And tonight, you were

05:10.257 --> 05:12.457
resurrected

05:12.459 --> 05:13.992
from the dead.

05:16.429 --> 05:18.963
Find anything yet?

05:18.965 --> 05:23.173
Necromancy is everywhere
in occult literature.

05:23.176 --> 05:26.272
It's a form of sorcery that
dates back to ancient Greece.

05:26.275 --> 05:28.376
It involves the ability
to communicate with

05:28.379 --> 05:30.074
and raise the dead.

05:30.076 --> 05:34.012
But there's nothing about
a specific necromancer,

05:34.014 --> 05:35.313
so whoever this dude is,

05:35.316 --> 05:37.434
he's been erased from history
like every other monster

05:37.436 --> 05:39.079
that comes looking for the knife.

05:39.082 --> 05:42.782
Is there any way to stop him
from bringing back dead people?

05:42.785 --> 05:44.484
Because if this week is any indication,

05:44.487 --> 05:46.087
it's kind of becoming a thing.

05:46.090 --> 05:48.623
I'll look into it, but
tomorrow's my day off,

05:48.626 --> 05:50.392
so it might take a minute.

05:50.395 --> 05:52.285
Evil never takes a holiday, Dorian.

05:52.288 --> 05:55.567
Well, every year on
Remembrance Day, I do.

05:55.569 --> 05:59.196
I write my letters, pack my
lunch and I head to the cemetery

05:59.199 --> 06:02.234
and ring that bell in
honor of my dead family.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.604
So for the next 24 hours,

06:04.607 --> 06:06.173
ask Dr. Saltzman.

06:06.176 --> 06:08.577
Fair. But I'm worried about him.

06:08.580 --> 06:09.879
Do you think he's okay?

06:09.882 --> 06:12.182
I think after the week
he's had, he needs a nap.

06:12.185 --> 06:13.618
And a therapist.

06:13.621 --> 06:16.454
Maybe even a vacation of his own.

06:16.456 --> 06:18.756
Take these to him for me, would you?

06:18.758 --> 06:20.224
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

06:34.474 --> 06:37.709
Ah.

06:37.711 --> 06:39.510
Ooh.

06:39.512 --> 06:42.947
You have a powerful
scent of death on you.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.250
Uh-huh...

06:47.253 --> 06:49.354
It's quite lovely, really.

06:49.356 --> 06:51.623
I thought maybe we could talk.

06:59.833 --> 07:04.202
Such a puny creature dares to dalliance

07:04.204 --> 07:06.626
with The Almighty Necromancer?

07:06.629 --> 07:08.606
Well, here's the thing about that.

07:08.608 --> 07:10.475
You don't exist.

07:10.478 --> 07:11.544
I won't fall

07:11.547 --> 07:13.844
- for your mind games.
- This isn't a game.

07:13.847 --> 07:16.114
Let me lay it out for you.

07:16.116 --> 07:17.515
You died,

07:17.517 --> 07:19.050
you were in a dark place

07:19.052 --> 07:20.418
for what felt like an eternity,

07:20.420 --> 07:22.634
until suddenly, you were
pulled into the light

07:22.637 --> 07:25.184
with a singular, inexplicable mission

07:25.187 --> 07:27.727
to retrieve a knife.

07:27.730 --> 07:29.664
Do continue.

07:29.667 --> 07:33.564
It's been the same with all the
creatures that came before you.

07:33.567 --> 07:34.899
A dragon,

07:34.901 --> 07:36.496
a gargoyle, a...

07:36.499 --> 07:38.103
an Arachne, a dryad.

07:38.106 --> 07:39.251
Bah. Such creatures

07:39.254 --> 07:41.673
- exist only in fiction.
- No.

07:41.675 --> 07:45.059
They've been erased from
history, and so have you.

07:45.062 --> 07:47.178
That's preposterous.

07:47.180 --> 07:48.913
I'm world-renowned.

07:48.915 --> 07:52.684
People tremble at the sound of my name.

07:52.686 --> 07:54.719
Don't believe me?

07:56.523 --> 07:58.122
Read up.

08:06.132 --> 08:11.769
No! No! No!

08:11.771 --> 08:14.660
No! No!

08:14.663 --> 08:15.973
No!

08:17.210 --> 08:19.444
A lifetime's work,

08:19.446 --> 08:22.380
my legacy, reduced to
something as-as pitiful

08:22.382 --> 08:24.449
as a brand of sorcery?

08:24.451 --> 08:26.417
Where I am barely a footnote?

08:30.297 --> 08:34.666
Who's responsible for this vile affront?

08:36.328 --> 08:39.097
That's what I'm hoping
you can help me figure out.

08:49.642 --> 08:52.981
Well, then, I'm all ears.

08:59.755 --> 09:01.108
If you want to get
to the bottom of this,

09:01.110 --> 09:03.028
we need to know who's
communicating with you.

09:03.031 --> 09:06.822
No one's communicating with
me. My mind is a steel trap.

09:06.825 --> 09:09.400
But you knew to resurrect
Dr. Saltzman's dead fiancée

09:09.403 --> 09:11.568
right after he mentioned
her to the dryad.

09:11.570 --> 09:14.185
That's why he had questions.

09:14.188 --> 09:15.513
It can't be a coincidence.

09:15.516 --> 09:17.407
You're all coming after the same thing,

09:17.409 --> 09:20.243
communicating in some way,
so who's pulling the strings?

09:20.245 --> 09:23.413
I am no puppet.

09:28.587 --> 09:33.189
It's less a voice, more an instinct.

09:33.191 --> 09:35.151
I simply know things.

09:35.154 --> 09:37.421
Like you know you're
here to retrieve a knife

09:37.424 --> 09:40.058
and return it to a
place called Malivore.

09:43.100 --> 09:46.235
If I return the knife to
Malivore, I will be free.

09:46.238 --> 09:47.971
- Of what?
- The blackness.

09:47.973 --> 09:49.439
The void. The empty oblivion.

09:49.441 --> 09:51.741
Do you ever just say things once?

09:51.743 --> 09:54.208
And more importantly,

09:54.211 --> 09:56.179
do you know how to get there?

09:56.181 --> 09:59.316
Only that the knife will lead me.

10:03.689 --> 10:05.855
I'm assuming you know this symbol.

10:05.857 --> 10:09.259
It is the sign of the
worst existential nightmare.

10:09.261 --> 10:11.695
- The ultimate hell. The...
- You're doing it again.

10:11.697 --> 10:14.190
Focus. What does it mean?

10:14.193 --> 10:18.229
That symbol represents what
you say has happened to me.

10:18.232 --> 10:21.538
It means no one remembers you.

10:21.540 --> 10:23.807
No one celebrates you.

10:23.809 --> 10:27.444
No one mourns you.

10:27.446 --> 10:30.146
Loosely translated,

10:30.148 --> 10:33.617
it means "permanent death."

10:44.630 --> 10:46.763
That's not a good idea.

10:47.933 --> 10:49.388
I need to call my mom.

10:49.391 --> 10:51.037
I thought I asked you
not to leave her alone.

10:51.039 --> 10:53.840
She was cold. I got her some tea.

10:53.843 --> 10:55.438
Oh.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.574
Cassie,

10:57.576 --> 11:00.611
this situation... I'm afraid
it might not be permanent,

11:00.614 --> 11:02.345
and I don't know how fair
it would be to your mother

11:02.347 --> 11:03.713
right now to hear your voice.

11:03.715 --> 11:05.448
So you think I'm gonna die again?

11:05.450 --> 11:06.883
I think it's likely.

11:06.885 --> 11:08.785
I'm sorry.

11:08.787 --> 11:10.572
I understand that this is...

11:10.575 --> 11:13.623
an emotional experience
for everyone involved.

11:13.625 --> 11:16.459
And I will be here
every step of the way.

11:16.461 --> 11:18.028
Is there anything I can get you?

11:18.030 --> 11:21.364
I'm hungry. I need a shower.

11:21.366 --> 11:22.932
That's not a problem.

11:22.934 --> 11:26.005
And then I'd like to get to the
bottom of how you murdered me.

11:27.072 --> 11:29.252
Do you remember how you died?

11:29.255 --> 11:32.175
I was wandering the beach of Normandy

11:32.177 --> 11:33.869
in need of a pick-me-up, so I thought

11:33.872 --> 11:37.414
I'd resurrect a few G.I.s
to toy with some Nazis.

11:37.416 --> 11:40.416
I'm glad to hear even evil
creatures don't like Nazis.

11:40.419 --> 11:42.218
Nobody likes Nazis.

11:42.220 --> 11:43.553
One minute,

11:43.555 --> 11:45.822
I'm dancing with the dead on the sand,

11:45.824 --> 11:48.892
and the next, there was just blackness.

11:48.894 --> 11:50.527
But you don't remember who killed you?

11:50.529 --> 11:53.322
No, although that's not uncommon.

11:53.325 --> 11:54.497
The subconscious

11:54.499 --> 11:57.600
has a way of protecting the
mind against the trauma of death.

11:57.602 --> 11:59.884
I see it all the time
in my line of work.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.971
But theoretically, that
memory still exists.

12:02.974 --> 12:05.241
Right? What if there
was a way to access it?

12:05.243 --> 12:09.479
You want to take a walk
through my subconscious?

12:09.481 --> 12:12.182
Oh, oh, oh.

12:12.184 --> 12:13.607
Well,

12:13.610 --> 12:16.944
at your own peril, my dear.

12:16.947 --> 12:19.489
'Cause I'm not sure
you're quite tall enough

12:19.491 --> 12:23.560
to ride the scary rides, huh?

12:23.562 --> 12:28.698
I assume you've got a
powerful vampire handy?

12:28.700 --> 12:31.901
Absolutely.

12:33.171 --> 12:34.471
Come on, push it out.

12:34.473 --> 12:37.006
- Come on, man.
- It's too much.

12:37.008 --> 12:39.380
Not nearly enough.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.600
It's them weak-ass bunny
blood muscles talking.

12:41.603 --> 12:43.486
Ain't got nothing to
do with bunny blood.

12:43.489 --> 12:44.966
It's just heavy.

12:44.969 --> 12:46.683
Oh, yeah?

12:48.536 --> 12:49.652
Hmm.

12:53.592 --> 12:55.925
I was on a hunger strike

12:55.927 --> 12:59.863
for four days and can
still smoke that skinny ass.

12:59.865 --> 13:02.065
Think about that.

13:06.872 --> 13:09.639
MG? Do you know how to do a head dive?

13:09.641 --> 13:10.950
Is that a thing?

13:10.953 --> 13:14.042
It is, it just takes a
little, um, precision.

13:14.045 --> 13:17.950
I don't know. I mean, you
might want to get Kaleb.

13:17.953 --> 13:21.049
Kaleb's not on our
Avengers squad, now is he?

13:21.052 --> 13:25.387
Here. But not a word
of this to Dr. Saltzman.

13:32.097 --> 13:33.797
It's for Cassie,

13:33.799 --> 13:36.199
when she's done in the shower.

13:39.004 --> 13:41.004
Thanks.

13:44.009 --> 13:45.308
You doing okay?

13:45.310 --> 13:47.911
- My head keeps spinning.
- Yeah.

13:47.913 --> 13:50.280
Well, I wish there was
something I could say to help,

13:50.282 --> 13:52.115
but having just been
through this myself,

13:52.117 --> 13:54.984
I'm not sure my head
will ever stop spinning.

13:54.986 --> 13:56.653
She thinks that I killed her.

13:56.655 --> 13:58.221
Technically, you did.

13:58.223 --> 14:00.607
It was an accident.

14:00.610 --> 14:02.192
Doesn't make her any less dead.

14:09.301 --> 14:11.801
This guy that brought her back,

14:11.803 --> 14:14.549
do you think that we can
convince him to let her stay?

14:14.552 --> 14:17.273
I'd like to help you out,

14:17.275 --> 14:19.909
but as soon as I can
figure out how to kill him,

14:19.911 --> 14:24.480
he's out of here, and
likely, her along with him.

14:24.482 --> 14:26.182
But then another monster will come,

14:26.184 --> 14:28.271
and what if it's worse than this one?

14:28.274 --> 14:30.066
Don't you think we should
at least think about keeping

14:30.068 --> 14:31.254
- him around?
- I would rather spend

14:31.256 --> 14:32.555
a lifetime slaying dragons

14:32.557 --> 14:34.207
than have another kid at this school

14:34.210 --> 14:36.377
go through what you and
I have just experienced

14:36.380 --> 14:38.027
at the hands of this creature.

14:40.065 --> 14:44.634
Look, the only advice

14:44.636 --> 14:50.273
I can offer you is to find closure.

14:50.275 --> 14:52.671
When someone is taken from us too soon,

14:52.674 --> 14:54.374
it can haunt us forever.

14:55.847 --> 14:59.449
Use this time well.

14:59.451 --> 15:01.451
Make your peace with her.

15:04.322 --> 15:06.451
It's so cold. It's like compulsion,

15:06.454 --> 15:08.221
but while I'm on the
surface of his mind,

15:08.224 --> 15:11.127
heroic-like, I'm plunging
you into the deep end...

15:12.329 --> 15:14.130
Holy Mary, mother of demons.

15:14.133 --> 15:17.193
Hello, Milton.

15:17.196 --> 15:20.330
Your great-nana Imogene is waving hello

15:20.333 --> 15:22.505
just over your shoulder.

15:22.507 --> 15:24.440
You can see my great-nana?

15:24.442 --> 15:26.743
Oh, I can see everything.

15:26.745 --> 15:30.747
She's most disappointed
in you for forsaking Jesus,

15:30.749 --> 15:33.149
who I can also see, but, oh, I know,

15:33.151 --> 15:35.174
that's another can of worms.

15:35.177 --> 15:36.920
Shall we begin?

15:36.922 --> 15:38.121
Uh...

15:39.591 --> 15:40.957
We're going in there?

15:40.959 --> 15:42.458
- With him?
- With me,

15:42.460 --> 15:44.724
- The Almighty Necro...
- Please.

15:44.727 --> 15:46.262
Can we not do all that again?

15:47.544 --> 15:49.399
Did you steal them
keys from Dr. Saltzman?

15:49.401 --> 15:51.619
- Yeah, I did.
- Oh, boy.

15:51.622 --> 15:54.170
MG, pull it together.

15:54.172 --> 15:56.105
You have no reason to fear me,

15:56.107 --> 15:57.997
I assure you.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.609
You're basically the Grim Reaper.

15:59.611 --> 16:03.713
Oh, the Reaper is a
carnival sideshow hack!

16:03.715 --> 16:06.096
No, you... you dirty your mouth

16:06.099 --> 16:08.084
mentioning his name in my presence.

16:08.086 --> 16:10.954
Perhaps I should summon Nana
to wash it out with soap?

16:10.956 --> 16:12.822
No, you leave my Nana be.

16:12.824 --> 16:15.491
Don't nobody need to be
whupped by Nana right now.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.994
Okay. I stand here,

16:18.997 --> 16:20.127
hands on his shoulders.

16:20.130 --> 16:22.697
- Ooh.
- Now, you and I

16:22.700 --> 16:25.335
join hands.

16:32.243 --> 16:33.910
Now I look into your eyes.

16:33.912 --> 16:35.794
Open your mind to me.

16:35.797 --> 16:37.981
Like, lifting a window
to let the breeze in.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.694
I'll be damned.

16:51.696 --> 16:55.568
I mean, I'm obviously
damned, but it worked.

16:55.571 --> 16:57.171
What the hell are we doing here?

16:57.174 --> 16:59.510
You are the one who
invited yourself along.

16:59.513 --> 17:01.571
Here. This restaurant is in New Orleans.

17:01.573 --> 17:03.599
I've spent half my childhood here.

17:03.602 --> 17:04.834
Yes.

17:04.837 --> 17:06.337
Rousseau's.

17:06.339 --> 17:08.411
I spent a good amount of time here

17:08.414 --> 17:10.275
before the 1920s.

17:10.278 --> 17:11.400
Your father was good

17:11.403 --> 17:14.784
for my business, always killing people.

17:14.786 --> 17:16.452
How do you know about my dad?

17:16.454 --> 17:18.855
Well, he's standing right behind you.

17:20.959 --> 17:23.126
Kidding. Kidding.

17:23.127 --> 17:26.628
But his spirit is all around you.

17:26.631 --> 17:27.971
Plus, he and I did

17:27.973 --> 17:29.999
our fair share of drinking here

17:30.001 --> 17:31.968
when he was at his most murdery.

17:31.970 --> 17:33.536
Are you messing with me right now?

17:33.538 --> 17:36.539
Frankly, I think you're the one

17:36.541 --> 17:37.874
messing with me.

17:37.876 --> 17:39.609
All this talk about

17:39.611 --> 17:41.911
solving the mystery of Malivore.

17:41.913 --> 17:43.646
I think you and I both know

17:43.648 --> 17:45.552
which mystery you'd love me to solve.

17:46.552 --> 17:48.947
You want to know how your dad is.

17:48.950 --> 17:52.488
Or should I say, where he is? Huh?

17:52.490 --> 17:54.090
No. No, I don't.

17:54.092 --> 17:55.725
Sure you do.

17:55.727 --> 17:59.495
You want to know if he's at
peace or if he's suffering.

17:59.497 --> 18:01.523
Regretting his sacrifice.

18:01.526 --> 18:04.994
After all, he did die to save your life.

18:04.997 --> 18:06.580
A lovely gesture

18:06.583 --> 18:08.893
for such a mercurial man.

18:08.896 --> 18:11.294
Hmm. Not to bother.

18:11.297 --> 18:12.663
I'm not telling you anything

18:12.666 --> 18:14.443
until we've finished our journey.

18:14.446 --> 18:17.947
Now, let's get started, shall we?

18:17.949 --> 18:20.516
This is my conscious mind.

18:20.518 --> 18:23.019
We need to find the
door to my subconscious.

18:23.021 --> 18:25.254
Look for a hallway to nowhere,

18:25.256 --> 18:27.924
an endless staircase.
Something like that.

18:29.527 --> 18:32.962
Ooh, a second line.

18:32.965 --> 18:34.598
My favorite.

18:46.544 --> 18:48.578
Yeah!

18:48.580 --> 18:51.681
How I love the macabre!

18:51.683 --> 18:55.685
Oh, oh, the dance of death.

18:55.687 --> 18:59.689
I wonder, who's the guest of honor?

19:01.326 --> 19:03.126
Let's take a look.

19:03.128 --> 19:05.557
Perhaps,

19:05.560 --> 19:07.830
Klaus Mikaelson?

19:07.832 --> 19:08.931
No!

19:10.602 --> 19:12.091
There's nothing there.

19:12.094 --> 19:14.061
You're not ready for the truth.

19:14.064 --> 19:15.838
No, like, literally, nothing.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.141
Hmm?

19:18.143 --> 19:20.705
Ah, clever girl.

19:20.708 --> 19:25.781
May I present the door
to my subconscious?

19:25.783 --> 19:27.817
Well done, you.

19:42.977 --> 19:45.344
I'm glad that's over. I'm shaking,

19:45.347 --> 19:47.614
- my hands are sweaty, I...
- Unbelievable.

19:49.443 --> 19:51.240
He ditched me.

19:52.443 --> 19:54.240
He ditched me.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.400
Send me back in.

19:59.401 --> 20:00.982
I'm not that good at this.

20:00.985 --> 20:03.401
You'll be fine. If he's
going in search of answers,

20:03.404 --> 20:04.637
I need to be there

20:04.639 --> 20:06.810
when he finds them.

20:06.813 --> 20:07.940
I'm ready.

20:07.942 --> 20:10.343
Cool. That makes one of us.

20:50.718 --> 20:53.669
This is a little much, don't you think?

20:53.788 --> 20:56.088
Little much, don't you think?

20:56.090 --> 20:58.658
And you said you didn't like mind games.

21:18.513 --> 21:20.880
Cassie, I'm so sorry.

21:22.617 --> 21:24.917
Look, I know it doesn't mean much,

21:24.919 --> 21:29.455
but I am sorry for my
part in the accident.

21:31.192 --> 21:34.227
It wasn't an accident, Raf.

21:34.229 --> 21:35.895
And you know it.

21:35.897 --> 21:38.364
Why would you say that?

21:38.366 --> 21:43.035
Earlier, I couldn't remember anything,

21:43.037 --> 21:46.606
but when I was in the shower,
pieces started coming back.

21:48.042 --> 21:51.010
I have an excuse to not
remember, what's yours?

21:51.012 --> 21:53.946
I do remember. It
was... It was storming,

21:53.948 --> 21:56.724
and-and it was raining,
and-and the road was slick.

21:56.727 --> 21:58.026
And?

22:00.889 --> 22:03.036
And I took the turn too fast.

22:03.039 --> 22:05.286
The one you're always
yelling at me about.

22:05.289 --> 22:06.479
But that's not why

22:06.482 --> 22:08.127
I'm dead, Raf,

22:08.129 --> 22:09.762
and you know it.

22:09.764 --> 22:10.796
Cassie, no.

22:12.533 --> 22:14.233
I love you.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.235
I would never hurt you.

22:17.238 --> 22:19.438
I know that.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.864
But if I'm gonna sit here

22:20.867 --> 22:23.376
in your fancy new school
with that nice headmaster

22:23.378 --> 22:25.111
who cares about you and helps you be

22:25.113 --> 22:26.679
your best werewolf self,

22:26.681 --> 22:28.614
then you're gonna admit what you did.

22:28.616 --> 22:30.229
I didn't do anything.

22:30.232 --> 22:32.619
Why'd you take that turn too fast?

22:32.622 --> 22:35.054
I don't know.

22:35.056 --> 22:36.989
Yes, you do, Raf. Tell me.

22:36.991 --> 22:39.225
- I didn't mean to.
- But you did.

22:39.227 --> 22:40.660
You blamed it on the storm,

22:40.662 --> 22:42.161
but think, think about what you did.

22:42.163 --> 22:43.329
Think about why.

22:43.331 --> 22:44.597
I don't know.

22:44.599 --> 22:46.400
Yes, you do, Raf, you're lying.

22:46.403 --> 22:48.968
- You're lying...
- I don't know!

23:12.860 --> 23:16.662
First of all, ow.

23:16.664 --> 23:18.731
Ow...

23:21.869 --> 23:24.603
Second, I'm here.

23:24.605 --> 23:26.105
Okay?

23:26.107 --> 23:28.007
I climbed your endless
staircase down into your

23:28.009 --> 23:29.475
bottomless pit of despair.

23:29.477 --> 23:31.911
Let's call an end to the torture.

23:31.913 --> 23:33.279
Okay?

23:33.281 --> 23:36.565
Hey, Almighty Necromancer,

23:36.568 --> 23:38.551
we're supposed to be in this together.

23:42.756 --> 23:44.789
Hello? Hello?

23:44.792 --> 23:46.826
Hello! Hello!

23:50.631 --> 23:52.031
Hope?

23:54.102 --> 23:56.002
Raf. Hey, Rafael.

23:56.004 --> 23:57.436
Rafael.

24:02.912 --> 24:05.546
It was my fault.

24:05.549 --> 24:07.913
I got pissed because I didn't medal.

24:07.915 --> 24:10.099
And then I thought my
girlfriend was flirting

24:10.102 --> 24:11.617
with the guy that beat me.

24:11.619 --> 24:14.687
I got jealous and I
picked a fight with her.

24:14.689 --> 24:18.447
And then all that-that anger
stuff started building up.

24:18.450 --> 24:21.685
That stuff that I can't
control, Dr. Saltzman.

24:21.688 --> 24:23.661
And then I started yelling at her.

24:23.664 --> 24:25.398
And then I took the turn too fast.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.933
And she's always telling me
not to take the turn that fast.

24:29.369 --> 24:31.903
And she was right.

24:31.906 --> 24:33.806
It wasn't the storm.

24:33.808 --> 24:36.409
It was me.

24:36.411 --> 24:39.078
I killed her.

24:42.316 --> 24:45.484
I killed her, Dr. Saltzman.

24:50.825 --> 24:53.986
Okay... Enough of this.

24:53.989 --> 24:57.696
I get it, you want me to
admit what I want from you.

24:57.698 --> 24:59.298
But you're wrong.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.668
I'm at peace with my dad.

25:02.670 --> 25:05.304
Yes, he died because of
me, but that was his choice.

25:05.306 --> 25:07.239
I've come to terms with it.

25:07.241 --> 25:08.707
You're wrong about me.

25:08.709 --> 25:10.843
I don't need to know anything.

25:14.582 --> 25:15.848
Screw this.

25:15.850 --> 25:18.217
MG?

25:18.219 --> 25:21.353
MG, get me out of here!

25:21.355 --> 25:24.290
MG?

25:27.562 --> 25:29.395
Hope. Come on. Come on.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.197
Come on out. Hope. Hope.

25:31.199 --> 25:34.100
Hope!

25:34.102 --> 25:36.035
Head dive's over.

25:36.037 --> 25:38.104
Come on, man. Let her out. She's scared.

25:38.106 --> 25:39.772
Come on.

25:39.774 --> 25:41.126
Let her out, man!

25:59.313 --> 26:00.953
There you are.

26:04.477 --> 26:06.564
I've been looking everywhere for you.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.200
I was wandering.

26:08.203 --> 26:10.634
Snooping.

26:10.636 --> 26:13.571
Look, I remember.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.639
I remember everything.

26:19.545 --> 26:23.347
I'll never forgive myself
for what I did to you.

26:23.349 --> 26:26.550
I'm not trying to punish you.

26:26.552 --> 26:28.819
That's not why I called you out.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.756
I just wanted you to be
honest with yourself about it.

26:36.562 --> 26:38.929
When I first got here to the school,

26:38.931 --> 26:40.231
uh, they told me that

26:40.233 --> 26:42.130
a lot of guys with my condition, they...

26:42.133 --> 26:44.169
have a lot of anger that eats at them.

26:45.703 --> 26:48.104
But I'm better now that I
know what was causing it.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.507
Oh, yeah?

26:49.509 --> 26:52.776
Then what was causing it earlier today?

26:53.856 --> 26:55.589
I knew that you'd never hurt me,

26:55.592 --> 26:57.915
but that didn't mean you
didn't scare me sometimes.

26:59.152 --> 27:00.618
My point is, you had

27:00.620 --> 27:02.943
a lot of work that you
needed to do on yourself,

27:02.946 --> 27:05.361
and you still do, werewolf or not.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.500
I forgive you.

27:18.771 --> 27:22.173
Now leave me alone for a few minutes.

27:22.175 --> 27:24.275
I want to stand in the sun.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.164
Dr. Saltzman.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.438
I screwed up.

27:48.441 --> 27:50.453
Hope's in trouble, and I can't help her.

27:52.203 --> 27:56.140
Why are you doing this to me?

27:59.712 --> 28:02.646
Okay, fine. Yes.

28:02.648 --> 28:05.282
I want to know about my dad.

28:05.284 --> 28:09.186
My family said that he must
have died with love in his heart

28:09.188 --> 28:10.955
and that he should've found peace.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.557
But how am I supposed
to know if that's true?

28:13.559 --> 28:15.859
I need to know that he's not alone.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.396
Because I can't live with
myself if he is alone.

28:18.399 --> 28:21.265
No one should ever have
to be alone like this.

28:21.267 --> 28:25.069
Please.

28:30.743 --> 28:33.279
- Oh, hey.
- Don't "hey" me.

28:33.282 --> 28:34.516
Get me out of here.

28:34.519 --> 28:35.911
With pleasure.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.317
Oops.

28:42.042 --> 28:44.075
Daddy's home.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.100
- Hey.
- What's up?

28:56.102 --> 28:58.502
What's up?

28:58.504 --> 29:01.305
If I'm gonna be a vampire,
I need to be strong enough

29:01.307 --> 29:03.685
to handle everything
that comes along with it.

29:03.688 --> 29:05.154
People get hurt

29:05.157 --> 29:07.211
if I'm weak.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.789
So feed me blood.

29:09.711 --> 29:11.282
Feed me whatever it takes.

29:11.284 --> 29:12.850
Hallelujah.

29:12.853 --> 29:14.586
The Prodigal Son has returned.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.083
I mean, how could you be so reckless?

29:18.086 --> 29:19.344
You weren't getting anywhere.

29:19.347 --> 29:20.904
And so you took it upon yourself?

29:20.907 --> 29:22.393
- And how did that go?
- Not well.

29:22.395 --> 29:24.495
Yeah? Well, I have it
under control, Hope.

29:24.497 --> 29:25.696
Oh, really?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.844
Then you want to explain this?

29:28.847 --> 29:30.375
Or this?

29:30.378 --> 29:31.669
Or anything else that would explain

29:31.671 --> 29:32.770
your utter lack of progress?

29:32.772 --> 29:35.272
I am grieving, Hope.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.078
And maybe you should try that sometime

29:37.081 --> 29:38.676
instead of pushing everyone away.

29:38.678 --> 29:40.411
Look, I am trying

29:40.413 --> 29:41.578
to protect you.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.414
That thing is a master manipulator.

29:43.416 --> 29:45.333
It resurrected my fiancée,

29:45.336 --> 29:47.286
it raised a cemetery of zombies

29:47.289 --> 29:49.953
and it brought back Rafael's
dead girlfriend, so let's just

29:49.955 --> 29:52.599
talk about the ways in
which it could torment you,

29:52.602 --> 29:56.000
starting with your dead mother,
ending with your dead father,

29:56.003 --> 29:57.639
and how about all the
ghosts of all the people

29:57.641 --> 29:59.697
that you killed in between, huh?

29:59.699 --> 30:02.833
- I can't believe you'd do this.
- Don't do that.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.201
You don't like that I broke your rules

30:04.203 --> 30:05.906
as a headmaster? Fine, punish me.

30:05.909 --> 30:07.575
But don't you dare
play disappointed dad,

30:07.578 --> 30:09.873
- because you are not my father.
- Oh, I know that.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.185
- And where are you doing?
- To finish what I started.

30:12.188 --> 30:13.243
Like hell you are.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.511
- Cloditay.
- Hope...

30:16.515 --> 30:18.515
Hope!

30:25.133 --> 30:26.457
Back for more?

30:26.459 --> 30:28.703
Tell me where my father is.

30:28.706 --> 30:31.935
I will tell you everything
you want to know,

30:31.938 --> 30:33.797
but wouldn't you like to hear about

30:33.799 --> 30:36.649
what I've just learned
of Malivore first?

30:49.211 --> 30:52.446
It's my day off, Ric.
We talked about this.

30:52.448 --> 30:54.615
Hope has sealed me in my
office and I need to get out.

30:54.617 --> 30:56.216
Just wait till the spell wears off.

30:56.218 --> 30:58.279
She's trying to negotiate
with The Necromancer.

30:58.282 --> 31:00.540
Ric. I'm off the clock.
This is the only day

31:00.543 --> 31:03.087
I take off all year.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

31:05.027 --> 31:06.627
All right.

31:06.629 --> 31:09.063
We're in Vegas and this here
is the all you can eat buffet.

31:09.065 --> 31:11.765
All right? We got the
omelet station right here.

31:11.767 --> 31:13.567
That there is the seafood tower.

31:13.569 --> 31:15.502
Chocolate fountain.

31:17.873 --> 31:22.609
After I left you, I returned
to the scene of my death.

31:22.611 --> 31:25.170
I saw a shadow. I felt a searing pain.

31:25.173 --> 31:27.781
And when I looked down,
there was a knife in my heart

31:27.783 --> 31:29.750
and emptiness all around me.

31:29.752 --> 31:30.970
A knife?

31:30.973 --> 31:32.820
The knife.

31:32.822 --> 31:35.022
Interestingly enough,

31:35.024 --> 31:38.826
that which I seek is
that which did me in.

31:38.828 --> 31:40.527
You've got to understand,

31:40.529 --> 31:43.967
to be killed by such
a trifle of an object...

31:43.970 --> 31:46.967
I was curious as to its power,

31:46.969 --> 31:48.969
so I jumped out of

31:48.971 --> 31:52.045
my subconscious and summoned
the spirit of the man

31:52.048 --> 31:54.243
who forged the knife in the first place.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.643
You left me in there on purpose?

31:56.645 --> 32:00.147
Oh, I had work to do, and
you had lessons to learn.

32:00.149 --> 32:02.516
From this man,

32:02.518 --> 32:05.751
I heard the remarkable story

32:05.754 --> 32:07.953
of Malivore,

32:07.956 --> 32:12.334
created to wipe the
scourge of the supernatural

32:12.337 --> 32:14.259
off the face of this Earth.

32:15.104 --> 32:18.297
Malivore consumed us, erased us.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.100
It was permanent death.

32:20.102 --> 32:23.709
And it was in Malivore
that we were left to perish.

32:23.712 --> 32:25.539
Until recently,

32:25.541 --> 32:28.976
when the knife started
beckoning us to bring it home.

32:28.978 --> 32:30.844
But why a knife?

32:30.846 --> 32:33.547
Decades ago, Malivore was contained.

32:33.549 --> 32:37.651
Three locks created
to seal Malivore shut.

32:37.653 --> 32:40.621
The knife is one of those locks.

32:40.623 --> 32:43.490
When all three locks return home,

32:43.492 --> 32:48.529
Malivore is free to open
its jaws of death once again.

32:48.531 --> 32:50.192
What does that even mean?

32:50.195 --> 32:51.595
Oh, my dear...

32:54.070 --> 32:57.671
...let's just hope you're
not still alive to find out.

33:00.204 --> 33:01.442
Okay, young grasshopper.

33:01.444 --> 33:02.709
It's called Snatch,

33:02.711 --> 33:04.244
Eat, Erase. All right?

33:04.246 --> 33:06.146
I read about it in Dr.
Saltzman's books about

33:06.148 --> 33:08.249
those Salvatore dudes that
used to live in our school.

33:08.251 --> 33:09.850
I-I feel bad.

33:09.852 --> 33:12.837
Don't feel bad, brother.
They're food, okay?

33:12.840 --> 33:14.254
It's like eating a burger. You feel bad

33:14.256 --> 33:16.048
- about the cow?
- Sometimes.

33:16.051 --> 33:18.218
Lizzie went through this
vegan phase, and she...

33:18.221 --> 33:19.460
just got me thinking.

33:30.940 --> 33:32.573
Delishes.

33:32.575 --> 33:33.974
Come on.

33:36.312 --> 33:37.644
Yeah. There you go.

33:37.646 --> 33:39.012
Oh!

33:39.014 --> 33:40.180
All right.

33:40.182 --> 33:42.483
Easy, killer. Okay.

33:42.485 --> 33:43.845
Slow down, buddy. That's enough.

33:45.054 --> 33:47.072
MG, dude's no that big,
okay? That's enough.

33:47.075 --> 33:48.649
MG, okay, calm down.

33:48.652 --> 33:49.885
MG! Get back...

34:02.872 --> 34:04.738
So let me get this straight.

34:04.740 --> 34:08.542
You left me inside your
freaky twisted mindscape

34:08.543 --> 34:10.826
so you could... what? Stall me?

34:10.829 --> 34:13.045
My apologies for the melodrama,

34:13.047 --> 34:15.449
but I needed to buy meself some time.

34:15.451 --> 34:17.985
To talk to some dead knife maker.

34:17.987 --> 34:19.085
That,

34:19.088 --> 34:21.536
and to retrieve the knife

34:21.540 --> 34:23.891
your friend Dorian had
hidden behind the stacks

34:23.893 --> 34:25.792
in the library.

34:25.793 --> 34:28.061
What?

34:28.063 --> 34:29.897
Because while you were trapped

34:29.899 --> 34:34.234
in just a small semblance
of the blackness I suffered,

34:34.235 --> 34:37.704
experiencing just an ounce of my agony,

34:37.706 --> 34:40.274
I was busy doing what I do best:

34:40.275 --> 34:43.235
controlling the dead.

34:43.239 --> 34:44.844
I don't understand.

34:44.847 --> 34:47.214
The answer, my darling, is yes.

34:47.216 --> 34:49.516
I was stalling you.

34:49.518 --> 34:52.953
Just as I'm stalling you now.

34:52.955 --> 34:55.572
Now leave me alone for a few minutes.

34:55.574 --> 34:57.024
I want to stand in the sun.

34:57.025 --> 34:58.759
Did you know

34:58.761 --> 35:01.195
that there's a lot of Bennett witches

35:01.197 --> 35:04.361
buried in the local cemetery
that excel in the art

35:04.364 --> 35:07.099
of mystical transportation?

35:07.102 --> 35:09.704
I summoned a little
help to ensure the knife

35:09.707 --> 35:13.740
returned to Malivore
quickly and without incident.

35:20.982 --> 35:22.767
Oh, my God.

35:22.770 --> 35:25.151
Come on, look on the bright side.

35:25.154 --> 35:28.355
You can get back to the daily
grind of your young life.

35:28.357 --> 35:29.690
And in moments,

35:29.692 --> 35:32.526
when the knife is returned to Malivore,

35:32.536 --> 35:35.537
I will be free to find peace.

35:39.734 --> 35:42.602
As for your father,

35:42.605 --> 35:46.240
he watches over you every day.

35:46.242 --> 35:49.243
He did die with love in his heart,

35:49.245 --> 35:51.306
and he doesn't regret his choice.

35:58.238 --> 36:00.738
But he won't find peace...

36:01.751 --> 36:03.190
...until you do.

36:04.220 --> 36:05.858
Eh, good luck with that.

36:09.565 --> 36:12.811
The knife is destroyed.

36:12.814 --> 36:15.290
One lock is released.

36:18.040 --> 36:22.822
And with it, so am I.

36:55.933 --> 36:57.376
What the hell is wrong with you?

36:57.379 --> 36:58.911
Man, we were just having a little fun.

36:58.914 --> 37:01.348
Fun? By feeding on human blood?

37:01.350 --> 37:02.916
Man, don't think we don't
know that all you feed us

37:02.918 --> 37:04.551
at school is that bunny blood.

37:04.553 --> 37:05.919
That's not being a real vamp.

37:05.921 --> 37:08.789
You talk a real big game
about shaping young minds,

37:08.791 --> 37:10.872
but you ain't even letting
us be who we really are.

37:10.875 --> 37:12.673
Do you know why I was
at the cemetery today?

37:12.676 --> 37:16.330
Why I take this day off...
Only this day off... every year?

37:16.332 --> 37:18.565
It's because I am honoring my father

37:18.567 --> 37:21.209
and my little sister,
both of whom were murdered

37:21.212 --> 37:23.313
by the very vampire
whose memorial library

37:23.316 --> 37:25.110
we are standing in right now.

37:25.113 --> 37:27.380
The place I come to work every day.

37:28.911 --> 37:31.311
364 days a year, I love my job,

37:31.313 --> 37:33.945
but one day out of the
year, I cannot stand

37:33.948 --> 37:35.447
the sight of this place.

37:39.354 --> 37:42.955
Do you even know what a Ripper is?

37:42.958 --> 37:45.425
Do you?

37:45.427 --> 37:50.831
A Ripper is a vampire who
is driven by obsession,

37:50.833 --> 37:52.933
who lives only for the gratification

37:52.935 --> 37:55.038
of their deepest desires.

37:55.041 --> 37:59.110
A Ripper will feed until there
is nothing left to feed on,

37:59.113 --> 38:01.909
and then they'll move on
to the next, and the next.

38:01.911 --> 38:04.368
And do you know what kind
of vamps are susceptible

38:04.371 --> 38:05.746
to being Rippers?

38:05.748 --> 38:10.217
If I was taking bets,
I'd say an impressionable,

38:10.219 --> 38:14.063
obsessive, clinically
ADHD, horny little kid

38:14.066 --> 38:16.224
like Milton Greasley.

38:20.162 --> 38:23.087
Dear Dad, I'm no stranger to death,

38:23.090 --> 38:26.204
but that doesn't mean
I want to talk about it.

38:26.207 --> 38:28.141
Once a year, for Remembrance Day,

38:28.144 --> 38:30.737
we're asked to write letters
to our lost loved ones.

38:30.739 --> 38:32.587
We sign our names, fold them up

38:32.590 --> 38:34.657
and scatter them
throughout the cemetery.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.844
I usually don't see the point in it.

38:36.846 --> 38:38.519
Why write to the dead?

38:40.516 --> 38:43.383
I'd rather not think about it at all.

38:43.385 --> 38:46.094
Except lately,

38:46.097 --> 38:48.821
Death keeps knocking on my door.

38:54.029 --> 38:57.215
Today I messed up, bad.

38:57.218 --> 38:59.618
I messed up in ways
that if you were here,

38:59.621 --> 39:01.701
you'd be so disappointed in me.

39:03.372 --> 39:06.006
I'm not sure I know how to fix it.

39:17.486 --> 39:20.738
She told me she wanted
me to be a better man.

39:23.425 --> 39:25.893
Can you help me with that?

39:29.632 --> 39:31.765
I don't know, but I'll try.

39:31.767 --> 39:33.667
I promise.

39:39.718 --> 39:42.118
I was told today that
you would never find peace

39:42.121 --> 39:44.177
until I found it in myself.

39:44.179 --> 39:46.647
I hope that was a lie told to punish me.

39:46.649 --> 39:48.515
God knows I deserved that.

39:54.886 --> 39:58.125
But if it's true, I'm gonna do better.

39:58.127 --> 40:03.551
Today I saw a glimpse of what
true loneliness feels like.

40:03.554 --> 40:07.768
Of what lies in store for me
if I don't find my own peace.

40:07.770 --> 40:11.371
So I'm gonna get to work on that.

40:13.142 --> 40:15.676
I'm glad to know you're with me,

40:15.678 --> 40:19.112
but I look forward to
the day when you're not.

40:19.114 --> 40:22.316
I love you. Hope.

40:32.628 --> 40:34.511
Hey.

40:34.630 --> 40:36.229
Hey.

40:38.133 --> 40:40.467
I'm sorry I didn't have your back today.

40:40.469 --> 40:41.868
Apparently,

40:41.870 --> 40:45.205
I was too busy launching
phase one of Mali-pocalypse.

40:47.242 --> 40:49.076
It's okay.

40:49.085 --> 40:53.487
Dr. Saltzman, he... he had my back.

40:58.186 --> 41:00.286
Oh...

41:00.289 --> 41:02.990
He still mad at you, huh?

41:02.992 --> 41:07.027
He's probably gonna be
mad at me for a while.

41:10.765 --> 41:14.667
Yeah, well, at least
with the knife gone,

41:14.670 --> 41:16.937
maybe we can finally get
some quiet around here.

41:16.939 --> 41:20.207
I wonder if that's possible.

41:20.209 --> 41:21.875
What's wrong?

41:22.845 --> 41:25.178
Landon's in trouble.
