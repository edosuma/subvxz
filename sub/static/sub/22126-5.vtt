30:11.177 --> 30:13.345
THE WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.348
-SORRY. OKAY.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.955
-I'M STEPHANIE HOLDEN.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.523
I'M SUBBING FOR JILL
WHILE SHE'S ON VACATION.

30:24.623 --> 30:28.827
-OH, [LAUGHS] I'M
MITCH BUCHANNON.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.898
WELCOME TO BAYWATCH.
-THANK YOU.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.457
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
TO KEEP THIS ON
TILL IT WEARS OUT AND FALLS OFF.

30:58.557 --> 31:01.127
-JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
CUT OFF MY CIRCULATION.

31:01.227 --> 31:05.164
-[LAUGHS] WELL, ACCORDING
TO A LOT OF WOMEN I'VE MET

31:05.264 --> 31:08.600
ON THE BEACH, I ALREADY
HAVE, AND THEY'RE NOT

31:08.700 --> 31:10.469
AT ALL HAPPY ABOUT IT.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.340
-WHAT CAN I SAY?

31:14.440 --> 31:15.975
WHAT CAN I SAY?

31:17.243 --> 31:19.345
-YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

31:24.750 --> 31:28.254
-WHY DID YOU LEAVE?
-BECAUSE I WAS MARRIED.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.758
WE'D BEEN SEPARATED FOR
TWO MONTHS WHEN I MET YOU.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.527
AND THE NIGHT BEFORE
CATALINA, HE CAME TO SEE ME

31:35.627 --> 31:38.030
AND PLEADED WITH ME
TO TAKE HIM BACK,

31:38.130 --> 31:40.366
TO GIVE OUR MARRIAGE
ANOTHER TRY.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.269
I'D SEEN THE PAIN THAT
YOU HAD GONE THROUGH

31:43.369 --> 31:46.472
WITH YOUR DIVORCE AND
I FIGURED THAT IT WAS

31:46.572 --> 31:48.040
WORTH SAVING.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.177
IT TURNS OUT THAT I WAS WRONG.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.180
WE GOT DIVORCED A YEAR AGO.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.748
-YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.417
-I KNOW.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.120

I JUST COULDN'T FACE YOU.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.922
AND THEN I WANTED
TO CALL, AND...

32:06.125 --> 32:08.227
THE LONGER I WAITED,
THE HARDER IT GOT.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.630
AND THEN IT WAS JUST TOO LATE.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.469
WELL, I'M NOT MARRIED NOW.

32:21.473 --> 32:24.110
-I THINK IT'S TIME FOR
ME TO TAKE A SHOWER.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.877
-NO, THE PLUMBING'S MESSED UP.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.757
GOT INTO BOTH OF US.

34:21.527 --> 34:25.331
-I THINK IN THE FUTURE
WE SHOULD TRY TO AVOID
WORKING THIS CLOSELY TOGETHER.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.567
-I THINK THAT WOULD BE
THE SENSIBLE APPROACH.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.735
-I MEAN, WE'VE JUST GOTTA
BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR PERSONAL

34:30.835 --> 34:32.204
AND OUR PROFESSIONAL
LIVES SEPARATE.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.938
-I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

-AT LEAST UNTIL YOU RESOLVE
YOUR FEELINGS TOWARDS GAYLE.

34:40.679 --> 34:41.780
-THEN WHAT?

39:46.151 --> 39:47.753
HOW DID YOU AND MY
HANG GLIDER WIND UP
ON THE SIDE OF A CLIFF?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.621
-IT'S KIND OF A LONG STORY.
-NATURALLY.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.356
-I GUESS IT ALL
STARTED WITH THIS GIRL.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.791
HER NAME'S WENDY.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.059
-YOU WANTED TO IMPRESS HER?
-YEAH, SORTA.

-NEXT TIME, BUY
HER A BOX OF CANDY.

-SO, HAVE YOU DECIDED
ON MY PUNISHMENT YET?

-WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO?

40:08.774 --> 40:10.208
-I DON'T KNOW.
-NEITHER DO I.

40:10.308 --> 40:13.011
I MEAN, ON ONE HAND,
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU,

40:13.111 --> 40:14.680
THE WAY YOU RESPONDED
UNDER PRESSURE

40:14.780 --> 40:16.314
YOU SAVED THAT BOY'S LIFE.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.017
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOUR
ACTIONS WERE COMPLETELY

40:19.117 --> 40:21.587
IRRESPONSIBLE LEADING
UP TO THE RESCUE.

40:22.488 --> 40:25.356
HOBIE, I TRUSTED YOU, PAL.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.659
YOU BLEW THAT TRUST
RIGHT OUT OF THE WATER.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.529
-DIDN'T YOU EVER DO
ANYTHING IRRESPONSIBLE
WHEN YOU WERE MY AGE?

40:30.629 --> 40:33.031
-YOU MEAN LIKE THROW
A PARTY WHEN MY PARENTS

WEREN'T HOME AND NEARLY
GET MYSELF KILLED?

40:35.333 --> 40:37.402
NO, IT WAS NEVER THAT TRAUMATIC.

40:37.503 --> 40:40.005
-YOU NEVER GOT IN TROUBLE?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.206
-YEAH, I GOT IN TROUBLE.

-WHAT DID GRANDPA DO?

40:43.141 --> 40:43.942
-OH, HE GROUNDED ME.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.210
HE'D MAKE ME STAY IN MY ROOM.

40:46.512 --> 40:47.679
-THAT SOUNDS PRETTY FAIR.

40:48.246 --> 40:51.650
-YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT THE
SAME AS WHEN I WAS A KID.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.152

DON'T HAVE A MOM

40:54.252 --> 40:55.921

BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
PAL, YOU'RE 13 YEARS OLD.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.159
I CAN'T BE THERE FOR
YOU EVERY MINUTE.

41:01.593 --> 41:03.461
I WANNA FEEL THAT WHEN
I LEAVE YOU ALONE,

41:03.562 --> 41:06.532
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
THAT YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

41:06.632 --> 41:07.833
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

-I DO!

41:09.434 --> 41:10.836
-YOU'VE GOTTA PROVE THAT TO ME.

-I WILL.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.440
-GOOD.

41:15.541 --> 41:18.109
BY THE WAY, THAT WAS
A TERRIFIC JOB OF CLEANING
UP THE HOUSE.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.812
I WOULD HAVE NEVER
SUSPECTED A THING.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.280
-THANKS.

41:22.380 --> 41:24.215
-FOR STARTERS, I WANT THE HOUSE
THAT CLEAN EVERY SINGLE DAY.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.952
AND I HAVE PRICED NEW HANG
GLIDERS AND I HAVE FOUND OUT

41:27.052 --> 41:28.787
THAT THEY ARE NOT
THAT EXPENSIVE.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.657
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU SHOULD
BE GETTING YOUR ALLOWANCE
