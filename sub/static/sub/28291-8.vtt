Hello.

38:08.590 --> 38:11.289
Right. Follow me.

38:12.551 --> 38:14.770
So, how do the rats
figure in?

38:14.814 --> 38:16.381
ULF: Well, it turns out
that the body

38:16.424 --> 38:19.775
has a very specific
biochemical response
to stress.

38:19.819 --> 38:23.997
Different subjects respond
differently when subjected
to trauma.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.266

38:32.310 --> 38:35.225

during Quill. Yeah.

38:35.269 --> 38:38.620
Rats are often vilified
as disease-spreading monsters,

38:38.664 --> 38:42.363
but they're
very intelligent
social creatures.

38:42.407 --> 38:45.453
Did you know they live
in communities?No.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.803
A rat will often take care
of a member of their group

38:47.847 --> 38:49.588
if it becomes
injured or sick.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.765
They protect each other?
They can.

38:52.808 --> 38:57.030
And individual rats
respond differently
to stress and trauma,

38:57.073 --> 38:58.858
just like people.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.555
See, I've been
working for years

which hormone leads

39:02.644 --> 39:05.299
to the most resilient
response.

39:05.343 --> 39:09.608
Why are some people
more effective
in the face of stress?

39:10.391 --> 39:12.350
Why do some fall apart?

39:16.223 --> 39:20.706
See, if I could bottle
the right chemical
combination,

39:20.749 --> 39:23.970
just imagine what
an amazing boon
that would be,

39:24.013 --> 39:28.148
not just for soldiers
returning home from war,
but for society.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.412

with the rats?

39:31.456 --> 39:33.240
I bred these rats myself,

39:33.283 --> 39:34.676
and they come
as near as possible

39:34.720 --> 39:37.244
to what seem to be
the most resilient
combination

39:37.287 --> 39:38.550
of various
stress chemicals.

39:39.072 --> 39:40.508
