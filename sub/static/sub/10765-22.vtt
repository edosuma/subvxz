00:04.204 --> 00:06.138
WiII, a deaI's a deaI.

00:06.206 --> 00:08.640
You picked the movie,
I pick the restaurant.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.972
PIease, man. 
This ain't no restaurant.

00:11.044 --> 00:13.069
I mean, there wasn't even
no goIden arches outside.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.572
WiII, pIease.

00:16.716 --> 00:19.844
You're this far from washing
windshieIds with newspaper.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.983
Now, just sit down and try to go
a haIf-hour without saying "yo."

00:29.129 --> 00:32.098
Yo, yo, yo. I'II have two of those.

00:32.432 --> 00:36.163
Ladies, heIIo.
This is your Iucky day.

00:36.236 --> 00:39.569
You know, anyone who sits in these chairs
gets served on the house.

Yo, they don't have no standards, man.

Look, now. Check it out. FoIIow my Iead.
I'm a rich and famous rap star.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.454
You aIways get to be the rap star.

01:02.529 --> 01:05.794
This time I'II be the rap star
and you be Gary CoIeman.

01:09.035 --> 01:12.971
-Ahem. <i>Bonjour,</i> sIimmies.
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

01:13.206 --> 01:17.438
<i>Bonjour, je suis un

01:17.510 --> 01:21.640
<i>-Vraiment! Un</i> rap star!
<i>-C'est fantastique.</i> I Iove rap.

01:25.885 --> 01:29.446
I am Renee and this is Monique
and what do you caII yourseIf?

01:30.290 --> 01:32.417
He's Tiny By Nature.

01:36.830 --> 01:41.324
So, how wouId you Iadies Iike to spend
an evening in Tiny's BeI-Air mansion?

01:41.401 --> 01:44.029
-Monique, he has a mansion.
-A big one.

01:44.137 --> 01:47.698
A tennis court, swimming pooI,
exceIIent schooI system.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.843
How about tomorrow night?

01:54.914 --> 01:57.678
We're onIy going to be 
in LA for four days.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.418
Excuse us for just one sec.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.616
Yo, when are UncIe PhiI and Aunt Viv
going out of town?

02:08.695 --> 02:10.252
Tomorrow through Monday.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.958
But what do we do
about HiIary and AshIey? Lie?

02:13.032 --> 02:16.695
Oh, no, man. Come on, they're famiIy.
We bribe them.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.338
Yeah, tomorrow night wiII be perfect.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.103
Separate checks, pIease.

02:27.447 --> 02:30.416
Tomorrow we go French.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.780
But tonight we go Dutch.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.192
Game pIan for tonight, WiII.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.700
As soon as the parentaI units
are out of the house...

03:55.768 --> 03:57.702
we pick the girIs up at the hoteI.

03:57.770 --> 04:01.501
Then, we pIy them with Perrier
to get them in the mood.

04:02.675 --> 04:06.133
Hey, CarIton, they're French girIs.
They're aIways in the mood.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.014
Do you know
the French word for forepIay?

04:11.150 --> 04:12.947
Because there isn't one.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.923
Okay, sweetheart, I am counting on you
to take care of your sister...

04:19.993 --> 04:21.824
whiIe your father and I
are at the jazz festivaI.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.385
Okay. But Iast time
 I squeaIed on HiIary...

04:24.464 --> 04:27.024
I found Barbie face down
 in the aquarium.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.747
Boy, boy. You kids and your music.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.742
When I was young,
Iyrics meant something.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.352
I was scatting, WiII.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.446
That's the most
expressive form of singing.

04:50.523 --> 04:51.785
For exampIe....

04:55.261 --> 04:57.195
<i>Vivian, gonna be late</i>

05:00.400 --> 05:02.197
<i>Vivian, gonna be late</i>

05:04.470 --> 05:07.098
AII right. HiIary, honey,
here's the number...

05:07.173 --> 05:09.607
where your father and I
are going to be staying at the hoteI.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.507
-Okay, I am ready.
-Okay.

05:11.577 --> 05:14.137
Wait! I forgot my purse.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.950
Has anybody seen my oId brown bag?

05:19.018 --> 05:21.851
Excuse me. You used to caII me Diva.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.321
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi, Vivian.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.390
WeII, what a wonderfuI surprise!

05:30.463 --> 05:32.522
I'II put these in the guest room.

05:33.599 --> 05:35.965
So this is what a hernia feeIs Iike.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.072
WeII, Bobby's visiting Lester's parents
for the weekend...

05:42.141 --> 05:43.870
so I decided to take a IittIe trip.

05:43.943 --> 05:46.844
Now, you know I'm aIways doing things
on the spur on the moment.

05:46.913 --> 05:50.371
Buy a new hat, paint the house,
get a divorce.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.309
Not again.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.746
This time he's gone too far.

05:56.255 --> 06:00.055
Hey, does UncIe Lester stiII do that
"puII my finger" thing in church?

06:03.029 --> 06:07.125
I don't want to taIk about it.
Not in front of the young one.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.735
That means it's about sex.

06:10.069 --> 06:13.368
Either UncIe Lester is
seeing another woman or becoming one.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.872
AshIey, don't be ridicuIous.
And no more <i>Oprah.</i>

06:19.579 --> 06:22.047
Shoot! And it's transvestite week.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.143
I'm afraid AshIey's right.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.278
I think Lester's messing around.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.416
Look, I just need a pIace
to stay for a whiIe.

06:31.524 --> 06:34.960
Oh, yeah, Aunt HeIen, that's cooI.
You can have my room.

06:35.261 --> 06:36.353
In PhiIIy.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.328
WiII, don't be so insensitive.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.359
You're staying at the Howard Johnson's,
and I won't take no for an answer.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.603
Boys, knock it off.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.477
PhiIip, we cannot go to San Francisco.

06:55.548 --> 06:59.075
Now, don't be canceIing anything
because of me. I'II be fine.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.780
You heard what she said.
She'II be fine. Let's go, Vivian.

07:01.854 --> 07:05.585
I am not Ieaving at a time Iike this.
Come on, sweetie, I'II heIp you unpack.

07:06.559 --> 07:07.617
Okay.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.455
What about our date? This is so unfair.

07:11.597 --> 07:12.757
You're teIIing me?

07:12.832 --> 07:15.027
I stayed up aII night
Iearning the French for...

07:15.101 --> 07:17.934
"Forget about my cousin,
y'aII can both have me."

07:23.443 --> 07:27.072
-Sweetheart, I feeI so bad about this.
-Me, too.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.671
You poor thing. You know what?

07:29.782 --> 07:32.580
I'm gonna go out
and I'm gonna buy something reaIIy nice.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.849
Oh, sweetie, that's aII right.
You don't have to buy me anything.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.890
I know. I meant for me.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.824
Honey, you know, aII married coupIes
go through rough times.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.660
-But maybe if you just taIk to Lester--
-TaIk to him?

07:46.899 --> 07:49.993
GirI, I wouIdn't give Lester air
if he was in a jug.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.797
WeII, sweetheart, I don't mean to pry...

07:53.873 --> 07:56.239
and you don't have to give me
aII the gory detaiIs, but--

07:56.309 --> 07:57.776
Vivian, I toId you.

07:57.844 --> 08:01.507
There is another woman in his Iife,
and I don't mean his ugIy mama.

08:04.584 --> 08:08.315
-But Lester is crazy about you.
-Was. Now he's just crazy.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.823
You know how some men
are animaIs in bed?

08:12.892 --> 08:14.189
Yes.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.325
WeII, I don't.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.028
WeII, I know how that goes.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.367
One day Iast month,
I met PhiIip at the door...

08:28.441 --> 08:31.035
wearing nothing, honey,
but Saran Wrap and a smiIe.

08:31.110 --> 08:35.011
WaIked right past me and said,
"Hi, honey, did you make that meatIoaf?"

08:36.249 --> 08:37.977
WeII, at Ieast he spoke.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.246
Vivian.

08:44.557 --> 08:47.082
Vivian, Iast night I foIIowed Lester.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.924
He drove over to this cute IittIe house
with this cute IittIe picket fence...

08:50.997 --> 08:53.830
and this cute IittIe homewrecker
opened the door.

08:54.901 --> 08:57.893
I wouId have been reaching
for my cute IittIe crowbar.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.196
I couIdn't find it.

09:03.175 --> 09:06.076
Anyway, she Iet him in...

09:07.013 --> 09:08.810
and he stayed.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.316
For how Iong?

09:12.451 --> 09:15.079
Let's just say I got tired of waiting.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.992
Look, <i>mesdemoiselles,</i>
<i>un petit</i> change of pIans for tonight.

09:24.630 --> 09:29.499
Instead of you coming over here,
we're going to rendezvous at your hoteI.

09:30.469 --> 09:33.632
AII right. But, pIease, baby.
 Baby, Iisten.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.940
Can I taIk for a second, baby?

09:36.609 --> 09:40.010
It's just that, you know, somebody
kind of dropped by the mansion...

09:40.079 --> 09:42.809
you know, unexpectedIy, you know.
So we....

09:43.516 --> 09:46.417
-Who dropped by?
-Aunt HeIen.

09:52.491 --> 09:53.981
What? No.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.995
You thought he said Aunt HeIen?
No, no.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.691
He said Van HaIen.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.897
WeII, not to worry,
my IittIe chocoIate truffIes.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.529
You can come by tomorrow night.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.469
Prince and Hammer
are coming by to pIay Yahtzee.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.316
Oh, sorry, gotta go.
Barry White's here.

10:21.187 --> 10:24.918
It's 7:15. Right now,
Bobby McFerrin is performing.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.423
I Iove Bobby McFerrin.

10:28.661 --> 10:32.256
Not as much as we 
Iove French.... Toast.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.401
Dad, caII me optimistic...

10:36.469 --> 10:38.869
but I'm sure you'II stiII make it
to the jazz festivaI.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.736
Aunt HeIen's probabIy bIown this
whoIe thing out of proportion.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.833
You're probabIy right.
Smith women tend to do that.

10:45.511 --> 10:49.379
I remember one day I came home
from work after a reaIIy rough time.

10:49.749 --> 10:52.240
I think we were having meatIoaf
for dinner.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.681
Anyway, your Aunt Vivian
was reaIIy furious at me...

10:55.755 --> 10:58.656
because I forgot
to mention her dress, or....

11:05.798 --> 11:08.096
Oh, my God!

11:10.836 --> 11:11.996
Vivian!

11:18.577 --> 11:21.876
<i>Tomorrow on</i> GeraIdo,
<i>French women who can't say "no. "</i>

11:26.585 --> 11:28.075
It's not fair, WiII.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.586
Monique is everything
I've ever wanted in a woman.

11:30.656 --> 11:34.524
BeautifuI, sexy, and
she measures everything in centimeters.

11:36.562 --> 11:40.726
Hey, Iook, man, aII I know is if we don't
get this house cIeared out by tonight...

11:40.800 --> 11:44.361
the onIy sweet things we gonna be near
is a coupIe KIondike bars.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.502
Vivian, sweetheart, come here, pIease.
Hurry.

11:50.576 --> 11:51.565
Come on.

11:52.178 --> 11:55.807
There is no more Saran Wrap
and Baggies are out of the question.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.317
No, sweetheart, it's not that.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.784
HeIen, couId you come 
in here pIease?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.947
Now, Iisten. 
I made some phone caIIs...

12:05.024 --> 12:07.754
and I managed to scare up an extra ticket
to the jazz festivaI.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.091
So we can aII go. Me, you and HeIen.

12:10.162 --> 12:12.130
I Iove you, UncIe PhiI!

12:14.200 --> 12:15.997
I'II get the bags and the car.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.536
HeII, I'II carry you 
there if I have to.

12:20.306 --> 12:23.173
Excuse me, Mrs. Lewis,
but you have a visitor.

12:23.242 --> 12:27.542
-Me? Who is it?
-Your husband, Mr. Lewis.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.516
Sir, I hope you brought
your protective cup.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.751
Sweetie pie, get your bags.
The taxi's waiting.

12:40.025 --> 12:43.085
WouId someone pIease inform
Action Jackson over there...

12:43.162 --> 12:45.494
that I'm not going anywhere with him?

12:46.098 --> 12:47.565
But, HeIen, you're my wife.

12:47.633 --> 12:51.069
If you refuse to Ieave with me
you know what I'm gonna have to do.

12:51.137 --> 12:53.196
Drag her home by her extensions?

12:57.676 --> 12:58.768
Nope.

12:59.311 --> 13:02.712
I'm gonna stay right here with you
untiI you change your mind.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.648
Good oId Aunt Jemima.

13:13.092 --> 13:16.994
Now, that's a strong woman.
I never saw her with a man.

13:18.063 --> 13:20.588
ActuaIIy, I hear that she
and the Quaker Oats dude...

13:20.666 --> 13:23.100
got kind of a JungIe Fever thing going.

13:26.906 --> 13:30.205
-Good morning, everybody.
-Good morning, Lester.

13:30.276 --> 13:33.473
-I just Iost my appetite.
-HeIen, pIease.

13:34.446 --> 13:38.815
AII right, I'II stay, but I'm not taIking
to him. Not after what he did.

13:38.951 --> 13:42.751
Baby, I know things aren't going
perfect, but why did you Ieave me?

13:43.556 --> 13:47.117
Was it because I Ieft my wet underwear
hanging on your wig stand?

13:51.463 --> 13:53.658
Wrong, but an interesting concept.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.600
Then what was it?

13:56.735 --> 13:59.568
The time I took that picture of you
on the toiIet?

14:02.174 --> 14:04.540
That's it. I am never
getting married.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.209
Lester, perhaps you'd Iike to continue
this conversation in private.

14:10.382 --> 14:13.647
How about if you continued it at home?
I'II get your bags.

14:15.387 --> 14:19.050
You know what? In fact, forget your
bags, we'II maiI them to you.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.456
Just go, you crazy kids in Iove.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.356
I apoIogize.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.992
This is no way for civiIized peopIe
to behave in someone eIse's home.

14:29.068 --> 14:32.663
-No need to, HeIen.
-It won't happen again.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.407
Good. Now, shaII we just enjoy
the rest of Geoffrey's meaI?

14:37.977 --> 14:39.501
Amen to that.

14:41.413 --> 14:45.645
HiIary, wouId you pIease ask the aduIterer
on your right to pass the biscuits?

14:57.296 --> 14:58.422
What?

15:05.571 --> 15:08.938
Dr. Connors, pIease.
It's her patient, Lester.

15:10.542 --> 15:14.672
No, not Lester the schizophrenic,
Lester the impotent guy.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.180
Yeah, I'II hoId.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.113
HeIIo, Anita. It's me, Lester.

15:24.757 --> 15:29.023
HeIen's driving me crazy.
I needed to taIk to you.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.493
No, I didn't teII her about you.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.967
And I think seeing you was a mistake.

15:39.505 --> 15:43.066
I mean, I reaIIy Iike you,
and you're reaIIy good at what you do...

15:43.309 --> 15:46.107
but there's part of me
that wouId prefer a man.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.182
Yeah, I guess you're right.

15:52.251 --> 15:55.084
It's not about you.
It's about me and HeIen and....

15:55.621 --> 15:57.714
Look, maybe now isn't
such a good time to taIk.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.758
I'II caII you tomorrow, okay?

16:00.893 --> 16:02.053
Oh, man.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.926
How you trying to pIay my aunt, man?

16:06.432 --> 16:09.492
Oh, that's it. I'm feeIing froggy.
I'm about to Ieap.

16:10.669 --> 16:14.537
Hey, but, hoId up.
WouId you reaIIy prefer a man?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.169
-Wait a minute, WiII.
-Back up, man.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.873
You think.... Wait.
Anita's my psychiatrist, WiII.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.278
Oh, yeah, right.
And I just won a Grammy.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.338
Come on.

16:26.518 --> 16:29.248
Come on, man to man,
toe to toe, come on.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.724
WiII, I understand your anger
and if you want to take out...

16:33.792 --> 16:36.818
your passive-aggressive feeIings
towards your absent father on me...

16:36.895 --> 16:38.385
then go ahead.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.733
Man, you reaIIy must
be seeing a shrink.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.107
Hey, what does it mean
when you dream...

16:50.175 --> 16:53.235
that you're fIying through a tunneI
on a Scud missiIe?

16:56.281 --> 16:58.078
Wait, hoId up.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.744
Aunt HeIen saw you going
into Anita's house.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.980
She thinks y'aII knocking boots.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.082
-What?
-Yeah.

17:05.891 --> 17:08.155
WiII, wouId you turn down the....

17:09.094 --> 17:12.029
Get away from him, WiII.
You don't owe him anything.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.689
I'm the one who signed his name
to aII your damn birthday cards.

17:16.135 --> 17:19.194
WeII, Aunt HeIen, Iook,
UncIe Lester got something to teII you.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.933
The woman that he's been seeing,
she's not no reguIar woman...

17:22.007 --> 17:23.031
she's a doctor.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.339
A doctor! Oh, that's good! A doctor!

17:26.912 --> 17:30.279
WeII, this'II give you a reason
to see more of her, Lester.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.677
HeIen! Stop it, HeIen!

17:43.162 --> 17:44.459
Who is that?

17:44.530 --> 17:47.727
I'm sorry, Aunt HeIen.
My shower's broken.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.625
UncIe PhiI fixed it.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.438
Looks Iike he fixed this door, too.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.098
Yo! Somebody Iet me out!

17:58.644 --> 18:01.442
What's up? What's happening?

18:03.248 --> 18:04.613
What the heII is going on?

18:04.683 --> 18:07.015
"Gee, WiII, where were you
when you were supposed to be...

18:07.086 --> 18:08.417
"with two Iuscious French girIs?"

18:08.487 --> 18:11.354
"I was trapped in a bathroom
with my naked aunt."

18:14.293 --> 18:18.389
HeIen, now that I've got you
in a room without books...

18:18.464 --> 18:20.295
there's something I've
got to teII you.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.060
Ain't nobody gonna
teII me nothing!

18:22.134 --> 18:24.534
Lester, don't make me
get ethnic on you!

18:25.537 --> 18:27.095
Oh, damn.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.568
Woman, wouId you for once
Iet me do the taIking?

18:30.642 --> 18:34.169
-Now, Anita is a--
-I bet the hussy has a weave.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.147
And she's younger than I am, too.
Isn't she?

18:38.217 --> 18:39.741
Anita's my psychiatrist.

18:39.818 --> 18:43.310
I've been seeing her since I was passed
over for that promotion at the pIant.

18:43.388 --> 18:46.687
When I missed out on that job,
I Iost my confidence.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.929
WeII, I knew you Iost something...

18:53.565 --> 18:56.056
but I didn't know it
was your confidence.

18:56.435 --> 18:59.199
WeII, why do you think
I started seeing a shrink?

18:59.338 --> 19:02.307
-WiII, cover your ears.
-Yes, ma'am.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.385
How couId you think
I was even seeing another woman?

19:17.556 --> 19:19.285
WeII, you know what they say.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.417
If the rooster ain't crowing
in the henhouse...

19:21.493 --> 19:23.893
he must be cock-a-doodIing
in the barn.

19:26.732 --> 19:29.257
HeIen, I wasn't cock-a-doodIing
anywhere.

19:29.601 --> 19:33.401
When that job went south,
weII, my doodIe went with it.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.705
You know I'm crazy about you, baby.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.480
WeII, I wish
you wouId have said something.

19:45.384 --> 19:48.376
But, knowing me,
I wouIdn't have Iistened anyway.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.082
I'm sorry, baby.

19:53.725 --> 19:56.319
I stiII shouId have
toId you about Anita.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.831
I'm the one who's sorry.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.928
It was worth it if it worked.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.359
Did it?

20:07.472 --> 20:08.700
Did it work?

20:11.243 --> 20:14.178
There's onIy one way to find out.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.074
Guys?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.648
HeIp me! Somebody Iet me out of here!

20:27.826 --> 20:29.123
They doing it.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.525
I hope you two aren't upset
about missing the jazz festivaI.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.037
Don't be ridicuIous.

20:40.105 --> 20:44.269
What's important is that
you and Lester are back together again.

20:44.343 --> 20:45.503
Right on.

20:47.779 --> 20:50.111
Besides, I'm sure it'II
never happen again.

20:50.182 --> 20:53.811
No. Because we Iove
each other too much.

20:54.319 --> 20:58.312
No. Because we're moving
and we're not gonna teII you where.

20:59.958 --> 21:03.155
Bye, baby. Take care, now.

21:04.296 --> 21:07.094
Okay. Vivian, we gotta go.
Our reservation's for 7:00.

21:07.165 --> 21:09.224
PhiIip, you know...

21:09.368 --> 21:12.565
we so seIdom have the house
aII to ourseIves.

21:12.704 --> 21:16.640
Instead of going out, why don't we
just spend a quiet evening at home?

21:16.775 --> 21:20.643
-Together. Just the two of us.
-Sounds good to me.

21:23.348 --> 21:27.785
Vivian, when's the Iast time
we skinny-dipped in the Jacuzzi?

21:29.421 --> 21:33.187
I don't think it was the Fourth of JuIy,
but I do remember fireworks.

21:38.063 --> 21:42.056
I'II get the champagne.
You get the nose pIugs.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.013
AII right. They Ieft for dinner.
Now, remember.

21:57.082 --> 21:59.880
We don't have that much time
untiI they get back.

22:00.419 --> 22:03.684
-How wouId you Iike to see Tiny's Jacuzzi?
-Jacuzzi?

22:05.223 --> 22:08.681
But, Monique,
we do not have the bathing suits.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.632
No probIem, neither do we.

22:23.675 --> 22:27.202
Right this way, Iadies.
Yeah, Iet me turn on the bubbIes.

22:27.379 --> 22:29.074
Hey, what's up UncIe PhiI?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.508
UncIe PhiI?

22:31.483 --> 22:33.383
-WiII!
-Father!

22:33.819 --> 22:35.844
-CarIton!
-Mother!

22:42.361 --> 22:45.330
Lester, don't make me
have to get ethnic on....

22:47.065 --> 22:49.158
Don't make me have
to get ethnic on you!

22:50.502 --> 22:52.265
You get the champagne.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.464
I'II get the champagne.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.966
-Somebody get the damn champagne.
-I'm just so excited.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.577
Aunt HeIen....

23:01.980 --> 23:04.414
You're staying at the Howard Johnson.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.414
<i>l couldn't say anything after that.</i>

23:08.487 --> 23:10.512
<i>He should really shut up now,</i>
<i>but he won't.</i>
