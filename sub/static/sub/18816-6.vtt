<i>Ingredients for making gunpowder
stolen from under the Company's noses.</i>

00:04.800 --> 00:07.400
Failure to secure His Majesty's
gunpowder against the enemy

00:07.450 --> 00:09.350
is a criminal offence.

00:09.400 --> 00:14.100
It might be more effective if
we went after Sir Stuart himself.

00:14.150 --> 00:16.050
Those bastards at the Palace

00:16.100 --> 00:20.000
have opened a Royal Commission
into the sinking of the Influence.

00:20.050 --> 00:22.250
It is my belief that
some very powerful men

00:22.300 --> 00:24.950
were involved in an illicit
shipment of slaves

00:25.000 --> 00:27.550
and were complicit
in the deaths of those slaves.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.700
The bellmen and the newspapers

00:29.750 --> 00:31.700
tell me there's a new source
of prime grade powder in town.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.650
Our guns will fall silent in ten days.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.900
We need the powder in eight.

00:34.950 --> 00:36.950
I need more gunpowder.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.750
You'd risk the life
of your son for chlorate?

00:39.800 --> 00:42.300
- You are now one of us.
- Why burden him?

00:42.350 --> 00:44.050
Please understand
that, from this moment,

00:44.100 --> 00:45.950
I will burn your letters
without opening them.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.900
Then I will visit you in your dreams.

00:48.950 --> 00:50.050
James...

00:50.100 --> 00:52.150
I told the Priest how he visits you.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.350
There is a ceremony of exorcism,
which can eradicate the Barbason.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.950
My mother's name was Salish.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.750
My father had her sent
to Bedlam insane asylum.

Mooning about in the chill.
Staring into your head.

02:35.300 --> 02:36.700
You're as bad as your da.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.050
My father cast my mother into madness,

02:41.100 --> 02:42.900
then jumped in straight after.

02:42.950 --> 02:45.400
He's scarcely a man to follow.

02:45.450 --> 02:46.950
He was a good man.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.200
Yes.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.050
Yes, a good man who killed
his wife for convenience.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.950
You know nothing.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.150
Always cow-eyed
about your sainted mother.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.250
Or maybe it's about time
you know about your mother.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.550
I do.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.950
Do you know she took you down
to the river to drown you?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.700
Carried you across the foreshore.
A tiny baby in her arms.

03:17.750 --> 03:20.050
Innocent and sweet. She waded in.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.500
Held you under,
until the bubbles stopped!

03:23.550 --> 03:25.150
She was deranged, James!

03:26.450 --> 03:28.250
That's why your father had
her committed to Bedlam.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.150
To protect you.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.050
To save your life, son.
Desperate for your death!

03:34.950 --> 03:37.100
It took three men to pull you apart.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.750
She was clawing and spitting,

03:39.800 --> 03:41.850
dragged from the river
howling and screaming.

03:41.900 --> 03:45.400
Be very, very careful now!

03:48.300 --> 03:50.500
She wanted you dead, James.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.800
Go away, Winter.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.750
I'm not scared of you.

05:52.850 --> 05:55.050
What are you scared of?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.950
Of who they say you are.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.800
The African devil.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.400
Stop staring. You're scaring me.

06:32.450 --> 06:35.550
Go home to your mother.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.700
Helga loves you. You're safe there.
Go to sleep.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.700
All will be well.

06:40.750 --> 06:41.800
Go.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.450
Gentlemen,
I want you to pay attention,

07:01.500 --> 07:04.050
because all our lives
will depend upon it.

07:06.350 --> 07:08.950
This harmless-looking powder...

07:10.550 --> 07:11.900
is called chlorate.

07:12.650 --> 07:14.950
And on its own, it is harmless.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.200
But when it is added to the sulphur
and charcoal in our vats,

07:18.250 --> 07:19.350
it is anything but.

07:20.650 --> 07:24.200
Think of it as like
adding a baby to a marriage.

07:25.350 --> 07:30.600
All was ordered and calm
and now there is this thing

07:30.650 --> 07:32.400
that demands attention.

07:32.450 --> 07:37.100
Stops you sleeping,
belches, farts, screams...

07:37.150 --> 07:40.650
and she's going to make this
whole process louder and wilder,

07:40.700 --> 07:43.750
more insane, more impractical...

07:45.850 --> 07:49.400
and the only thing that will
stop this entire enterprise

07:49.450 --> 07:55.350
from erupting in a giant explosion
the size of Mauritius is this...

07:57.450 --> 07:58.950
and dedication.

08:00.550 --> 08:02.350
Because, from now on,

08:02.400 --> 08:06.300
until the powder is complete,
we have to stir.

08:07.450 --> 08:08.750
Continuously!

08:10.200 --> 08:11.400
You.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.450
You.

08:17.950 --> 08:19.550
And Robert.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.100
Stir.

08:30.150 --> 08:31.250
Stir.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.950
Stir.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.900
Frightened rabbit.

08:54.350 --> 08:55.600
Go to hell.

08:55.650 --> 08:57.550
He is African.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.350
They smell fear like dogs.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.150
He's a trumped-up fucking...

09:04.300 --> 09:05.500
antiquarian.

09:07.350 --> 09:10.450
Self-learnt. The worst.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.900
Busiest in the head. Doesn't drink.

09:12.950 --> 09:16.500
They should not be dropping him
on us like a black cannonball.

09:16.550 --> 09:19.550
Mr. George Chichester.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.650
Ah.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.750
Gentlemen. How good of you to see me.

09:27.250 --> 09:31.200
You can mystify it all you want,
but in the end, that is what it is.

09:31.250 --> 09:35.000
A cat in the middle of the desert,
with no nose.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.650
But what-- what an extraordinary
achievement, gentlemen.

09:42.700 --> 09:47.100
When you think that the pyramids
and the great Valley Of The Kings

09:47.150 --> 09:50.600
and the Sphinx were all
manufactured by men

09:50.650 --> 09:52.800
with skin almost as dark as my own.

09:55.850 --> 10:00.900
It almost defies all your--
<i>Our</i> current views of nature.

10:03.950 --> 10:06.400
You are very well travelled, sir.

10:07.550 --> 10:11.150
I just wish I had seen those wonders
without the benefit of chains

10:11.200 --> 10:12.700
around my arms and legs.

10:14.950 --> 10:17.550
Which brings me
to this tragic business.

10:19.650 --> 10:23.300
I have prevailed upon
the Prince Regent to open

10:23.350 --> 10:27.400
a Royal Commission into the sinking
of an East India Company ship

10:27.450 --> 10:31.150
called the Cornwallis
on July 10th, 1804.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.550
The Cornwallis?

10:35.800 --> 10:39.900
I thought the name of the ship
in question was the Influence.

10:39.950 --> 10:42.500
Its real name is the Cornwallis.

10:42.550 --> 10:46.300
But in the port of Cabinda
on the West African coast,

10:46.350 --> 10:48.900
its name was temporarily changed.

10:48.950 --> 10:52.250
But wh-wh-why...
wh-why was its name changed?

10:52.300 --> 10:56.300
Because, on July the 5th, it was
loaded with a cargo of slaves.

10:58.750 --> 11:02.050
Which is strictly not illegal in 1804.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.450
No. No. No.

11:04.500 --> 11:07.950
But the return of the abolitionist
Charles Grant...

11:08.000 --> 11:13.100
into the East India Court of Directors
almost a year previously...

11:13.150 --> 11:18.250
meant that the East India no longer
sanctioned the transportation of slaves.

11:18.300 --> 11:24.050
But these slaves were loaded by
East India Company directors anyway.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.900
As part of a thriving illicit network.

11:28.950 --> 11:30.750
It was done for personal profit.

11:32.300 --> 11:36.450
The ship was officially registered
as departing Cabinda empty.

11:38.050 --> 11:40.950
That is why it sailed
with only a skeleton crew.

11:42.550 --> 11:48.350
And this scarcity of crew is
almost certainly the reason why,

11:48.400 --> 11:51.000
within four days,

11:51.050 --> 11:53.400
the ship ran aground.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.050
Help yourself to breakfast.

14:06.050 --> 14:07.550
It's been two days.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.500
Why are you not looking for him?

14:14.750 --> 14:16.600
We had words.

14:16.650 --> 14:17.900
What words?

14:19.600 --> 14:21.050
A family matter.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.500
Well, I-I shall call on Mr. Thoyt.

14:25.550 --> 14:28.200
Perhaps we can glean
some knowledge from him.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.750
Oh, if there's any darkness, that
articled pimp will know about it.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.800
And then I intend
to visit Zilpha Geary.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.750
Why are you not worried?

14:41.450 --> 14:43.500
He won't be dead,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.350
and he won't be happy.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.850
You can depend on that.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.100
Open up!

15:13.150 --> 15:15.300
Open the door,
we know you're in there!

15:15.350 --> 15:17.250
<i>- Darlin'?
- What do you want?</i>

15:39.350 --> 15:40.400
James Delaney?

15:46.550 --> 15:49.900
He then said the ship was
doubly overburdened.

15:49.950 --> 15:53.000
280 slaves in a ship of 150 tonnes.

15:53.050 --> 15:57.300
The blackamoor then claimed that,
when the ship ran aground,

15:57.350 --> 16:01.150
the Captain ordered that
the cargo hold be nailed shut.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.150
So the slaves would all
go down with the ship.

16:04.200 --> 16:08.700
Leaving no evidence of the illicit
cargo to incriminate those

16:08.750 --> 16:10.400
who had arranged the shipment.

16:12.550 --> 16:15.550
Then he asked about your brother, Sir.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.850
And his sugar plantation
at Jumby Bay, Antigua.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.100
Chichester is their bishop.

16:34.150 --> 16:36.500
The king is safe.

16:36.550 --> 16:38.900
Delaney is a horse

16:38.950 --> 16:41.400
and Prinny is their queen.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.850
I think it's time we started
moving some pieces.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.550
Mr. Cholmondeley. Wake up.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.349
Change of guard!

17:19.400 --> 17:20.599
Steady as she goes.

17:22.950 --> 17:24.750
Steady as she goes.

17:29.150 --> 17:31.900
Steady as she goes.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.550
And may God have mercy on our souls.

17:54.350 --> 17:56.700
I was calling on the lady
of the house.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.650
If your wife is indisposed,
I will leave.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.500
You thought the man of the house
would be out, attending to business.

18:06.550 --> 18:07.850
But I have no business.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.300
Is your wife indisposed?

18:10.850 --> 18:13.800
Your visit is regarding
Mr. James Delaney, I presume.

18:13.850 --> 18:17.500
Yes, I thought Mrs. Geary
might know where he would be.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.150
Why would my wife know where he is?

18:21.200 --> 18:24.900
Well, she is his sister
and I already tried his attorney.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.100
You know,

18:32.150 --> 18:37.150
there are so many awful rumours
flying around London about him.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.150
I heard one about an actress
he keeps locked in his cellar,

18:41.200 --> 18:43.250
- enjoys the beatings...
- I don't need to...

18:44.100 --> 18:46.000
An actress...

18:47.200 --> 18:52.250
who enjoys walking with a man
with human flesh in his teeth.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.550
You know, you can even buy
a song about Delaney now.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.900
In Covent Garden, for a penny.

18:55.950 --> 18:57.700
I-I'll return when you're sober...

18:57.750 --> 19:00.500
It's about a cannibal who plans
to eat the Prince Regent.

19:00.550 --> 19:02.250
So it can only be about Delaney.

19:17.150 --> 19:19.050
Forgive me, I was...

19:20.450 --> 19:21.650
just dressing.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.000
He's been gone two days...

19:23.050 --> 19:25.200
And she thought you might
know where he is,

19:25.250 --> 19:27.100
because you are his sister.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.300
I'm afraid I have no idea where he is.

19:31.350 --> 19:34.250
I was just telling her about the rhyme
they all sing about him now.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.300
It's...

19:38.350 --> 19:41.450
<i>Tis in Pall Mall there lives a pig</i>

19:41.500 --> 19:43.050
<i>That doth this Mall adorn</i>

19:44.300 --> 19:48.250
<i>So fat, so plump, so monstrous big</i>

19:48.300 --> 19:49.900
<i>A finer ne'er were born</i>

19:51.650 --> 19:54.700
<i>This pig so sweet, so full of meat</i>

19:54.750 --> 19:56.500
<i>He's the one I wish to kill</i>

19:59.350 --> 20:02.400
<i>My fowls resign on thee to dine</i>

20:03.800 --> 20:06.350
<i>Sweet pig of fine Pall Mall</i>

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
They were singing that rhyme
long before

20:10.050 --> 20:12.450
Mr. Delaney returned to London.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.850
"Before Mr. Delaney
returned to London."

20:16.950 --> 20:18.100
Ah, yes.

20:19.550 --> 20:20.750
That golden age.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.650
You want to know where he is?

20:27.700 --> 20:30.600
My dear, the whole of London
wants to know where he is.

20:30.650 --> 20:33.300
His Majesty's Government
wants to know where he is.

20:33.350 --> 20:35.050
I'm afraid we cannot help you.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.350
Miss Bowe, my husband and I
would now like you to leave.

20:53.450 --> 20:54.850
Of course.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.700
Perhaps you be so kind
as to order me a carriage?

20:58.750 --> 20:59.950
No.

21:34.950 --> 21:37.600
The enigma that is James Delaney.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.450
You know, it's curious.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.700
This cholera epidemic that you and
I invented for our own convenience

21:43.750 --> 21:45.700
has actually begun to claim lives.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.700
Six people in Rotherhithe.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.700
It's as if the disease is not
transmitted by air or miasma,

21:51.750 --> 21:54.200
but by false rumour.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.050
Then it is the same as religion.

21:59.050 --> 22:00.700
Or patriotism.

22:02.350 --> 22:06.850
You have no God, certainly
no country. What do you have?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.750
Powder.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.400
When will you deliver?

22:14.450 --> 22:16.200
Tomorrow, at midnight.

22:25.150 --> 22:27.100
Zilpha, open this door!

22:27.150 --> 22:28.300
Zilpha!

22:28.350 --> 22:30.700
Open this door!

22:30.750 --> 22:32.600
Zilpha!

22:34.900 --> 22:38.700
Zilpha, open this door now!

22:40.950 --> 22:43.750
Zilpha!

22:47.800 --> 22:50.500
Australia! I swear it. I swear it.

22:50.550 --> 22:52.350
A position in Sydney, Australia.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.300
Ports and harbour assessor.

22:55.350 --> 22:57.350
And the jurisdiction of an assizes.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.600
And administration
of felons through the docks.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.400
Never lock your door or draw
your robe against me again,

23:06.450 --> 23:08.700
for I am an assessor!

23:08.750 --> 23:12.550
I applied for the position three
months ago. I didn't tell you.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.900
Here.

23:13.950 --> 23:16.350
Read it. Won't you?

23:16.400 --> 23:17.700
Read.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.400
Come now, all is forgotten,

23:22.450 --> 23:23.900
all is forgotten.

23:23.950 --> 23:26.550
How ridiculous it's all been.
Duelling.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.500
And you and I fighting like children.

23:28.550 --> 23:30.300
Australia is too far.

23:34.950 --> 23:36.000
Please leave.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.950
Let me finish here.

24:12.350 --> 24:13.850
All fires extinguished.

24:15.150 --> 24:17.250
Gently, gently, gently, gentlemen.

24:18.850 --> 24:23.100
Have the greatest of respect
for the inhabitant of this coffin.

24:23.150 --> 24:25.600
Famously volatile.

24:25.650 --> 24:27.900
Given to explosive fits of rage.

24:29.150 --> 24:31.500
May he rest in peace

24:31.550 --> 24:34.050
until he's reignited with his Saviour.

24:36.450 --> 24:40.900
Slow, slow, slow
over the potted roads.

24:40.950 --> 24:42.900
The chlorate is still there,

24:42.950 --> 24:44.250
it's just sleeping.

24:55.550 --> 24:57.950
"For the purpose of
preventing contagion." Hm?

25:01.800 --> 25:02.800
I saw you...

25:04.550 --> 25:07.200
and you saw something at the pond.

25:07.250 --> 25:08.250
What did you see?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.200
Nothing.

25:19.500 --> 25:22.550
I strongly suggest you
to continue to see nothing.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.600
Move!

26:37.250 --> 26:40.450
Hey. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.750
Whoa.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.900
What's this?

26:47.950 --> 26:49.550
Cholera.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.900
Cholera?

26:54.300 --> 26:55.950
Where's this cholera now?

26:57.300 --> 26:59.300
Hendon Road.

26:59.350 --> 27:02.550
It's coming down the Fleet
and Kilburn Rivers.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.900
Is that so?

27:05.700 --> 27:07.750
- How many?
- Six.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.300
And a child.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.150
I see...

27:16.150 --> 27:17.400
A child.

27:18.550 --> 27:22.150
Yes, it's very sad,
it's a whole family.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.000
Been dead for days.

27:24.050 --> 27:25.700
We haven't heard about that.

27:25.750 --> 27:28.950
We've being instructed to transport
them under the cover of darkness.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.700
So as not to alarm the populous.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.200
Oh, cholera, you say?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.300
Well...

27:43.200 --> 27:44.950
let's have a look, shall we?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.500
Torch.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.550
I wouldn't do that.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.950
Oh, Jesus Christ.

28:06.850 --> 28:08.350
Go on, go!

28:08.400 --> 28:11.250
Go. Get out of here. Go. Move on.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.350
Get 'em out of here.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.400
- What happened there?
- No idea, get on the horse.

28:19.350 --> 28:20.950
Move on!

28:24.400 --> 28:25.550
Good work, boy!

28:27.150 --> 28:29.250
Go on. Move out of here! Go!

29:20.200 --> 29:22.700
Gently.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.700
Careful not to wake the dead...

29:29.450 --> 29:31.700
as they reach
their final resting place.

29:36.950 --> 29:41.300
I will tell Mr. Madison I have made
an extraordinary discovery.

29:41.350 --> 29:43.450
A man in London
who can be relied upon.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.350
Hm.

29:46.400 --> 29:51.450
Yes, you tell him that and I will
rely upon him to give my ship

29:51.500 --> 29:54.750
safe passage through
the American blockade.

29:57.950 --> 29:59.950
If my factory is discovered...

30:02.350 --> 30:04.100
I will know where to find you.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.650
You stink of cow shit.

31:02.700 --> 31:04.400
It's horse shit, actually.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.700
We thought you might have
left for good.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.200
And would that be good?

31:19.750 --> 31:22.500
I visited your sister
to ask where you were.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.200
Three days and not a word?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.700
Did you think it would go unnoticed?

31:32.950 --> 31:36.700
The Company have men in every tavern
asking where you are.

31:37.950 --> 31:40.900
They're offering £10
to anyone with information.

31:40.950 --> 31:42.550
Making threats.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.550
Money being offered--
it's only a matter of time, James.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.200
You tell me one thing that isn't
just a matter of time.

31:51.750 --> 31:55.400
They say you're going to sell
the gun powder to the Republicans.

31:57.150 --> 31:59.750
Republicans haven't got any money,
why would I sell it to them?

31:59.800 --> 32:03.050
They think you're going
to start a revolution.

32:06.750 --> 32:11.400
If the Prince genuinely thought
I was going to start a revolution,

32:11.450 --> 32:12.700
I would be in the Tower.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.250
He's not a safeguard.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.950
If Crown and Company
solve their little dispute,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.200
they will crush you between them.

32:38.050 --> 32:39.350
What did my sister say?

34:18.199 --> 34:19.699
Zilpha?

35:51.200 --> 35:52.500
What have you done?

35:54.950 --> 35:56.150
I've killed him.

35:58.250 --> 35:59.500
Just like you said.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.350
Where is the body?

36:13.400 --> 36:14.400
In the bedroom.

36:16.450 --> 36:18.350
Are you sure he's dead?

36:18.400 --> 36:20.200
Quite dead.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.100
Sit there.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.650
- In the bedroom?
- Yes.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.800
When did I, um...?

36:58.300 --> 36:59.600
What?

36:59.650 --> 37:01.500
Nothing.

37:07.650 --> 37:09.300
You stay here.

37:11.550 --> 37:13.400
I will tell Brace
to arrange a carriage.

37:13.450 --> 37:15.650
By the time you get home,
the body will be gone.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.850
Home?

37:17.900 --> 37:18.900
Yes.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.300
- You are sending me home?
- Of course...

37:23.650 --> 37:24.850
or you will hang.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.750
I will get rid of the body.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.200
No-one will know.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.150
Of course.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.050
For immediate burial.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.500
Gentlemen,

38:35.550 --> 38:38.600
at last some good news.

38:38.650 --> 38:43.650
This morning, a lost sheep
returned to the fold.

38:43.700 --> 38:49.350
A penitent sinner saw the light and
spoke earnestly to the one true God.

38:50.550 --> 38:53.050
A devil was exorcised.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.950
A farmer, called Ibbotson,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.750
confessed to the priest
at St Mary's church,

39:00.800 --> 39:03.300
Greyhound Road, Hendon,

39:03.350 --> 39:06.550
that he had allowed the devil
into his life.

39:06.600 --> 39:11.100
He received absolution from
the priest and, this morning,

39:11.150 --> 39:16.550
the priest received his reward from
the Honourable East India Company.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.350
A reward in the sum of £25.

39:23.350 --> 39:24.350
Gentlemen...

39:27.000 --> 39:29.350
we have Delaney's factory.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.350
Finally!

39:58.400 --> 39:59.800
James!

40:01.350 --> 40:03.800
James. James. Catastrophe.

40:03.850 --> 40:05.450
The farmer Ibbotson took confession...

40:05.500 --> 40:07.350
- Calm down.
- James... No. No. No.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.500
You are betrayed.

40:11.150 --> 40:12.550
You shouldn't be here.

40:15.150 --> 40:16.300
I will deal with it.

40:18.650 --> 40:19.650
Go home.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.750
Mount up.

40:33.800 --> 40:34.900
We have him, men.

40:34.950 --> 40:36.300
Hurry up.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.050
Keep moving!

40:39.750 --> 40:41.200
To the heath!

40:44.800 --> 40:46.450
He won't let us shift it.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.150
James.

40:58.300 --> 41:01.500
The powder that we moved last night
was ready to be moved.

41:01.550 --> 41:03.300
That's why we moved it.

41:03.350 --> 41:06.450
The 50 kegs we have in storage
is powder that is not ready

41:06.500 --> 41:09.200
to be moved, because it is unstable.

41:09.250 --> 41:13.800
If you put those kegs on a cart on
a bone-hard road, they will explode.

41:15.450 --> 41:18.350
We are leaving now,
because we have being betrayed.

41:22.950 --> 41:25.050
No excuses.

41:25.100 --> 41:26.850
The talking is done.

41:30.300 --> 41:31.300
Jesus Christ.

41:47.350 --> 41:49.850
You, again.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.300
Is there more to tell?

42:10.650 --> 42:12.650
Check all the outhouses!

42:14.350 --> 42:16.050
Search everywhere.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.550
Search that building.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.600
Quickly. Move!

42:25.050 --> 42:26.850
It must be somewhere, keep looking.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.050
Oh, God!

43:05.850 --> 43:08.250
Is this the face of abject failure?

43:08.300 --> 43:10.300
He must have known we were coming.

43:10.350 --> 43:12.250
How, how did he know?

43:14.600 --> 43:16.000
Oh, God!

43:20.900 --> 43:23.300
Very well.

43:23.350 --> 43:26.550
We will allow him to think
he is one step ahead...

43:27.600 --> 43:31.750
while we exploit what is undefended.

45:16.050 --> 45:18.600
And to you, your church
on Earth and in Heaven,

45:18.650 --> 45:22.650
we offer honour and glory,
now and for ever.

45:22.700 --> 45:24.850
- Amen.
- Amen.

46:26.300 --> 46:27.650
Take that dress off.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.850

49:58.800 --> 50:00.550
I swear, I swear I didn't know.

50:02.850 --> 50:06.550
Now report.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.300
War has begun.

50:39.500 --> 50:41.400
Sorry about your news.

50:43.350 --> 50:44.600
Marshall.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.250
I need a ship.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.700
And I need to ensure
no-one else betrays me.

50:57.750 --> 51:00.750
Your man did not heed my warning...

51:00.800 --> 51:02.350
You don't want much, do you?

51:16.750 --> 51:18.850
You were meant
to be guarding his ship.

51:50.550 --> 51:51.850
Two possibilities.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.900
He sold you out,
cos you cut off his thumb,

51:56.950 --> 51:59.950
or you cut off his thumb,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.400
cos you knew
he was going to sell you out.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.150
Possibility one-- reason.

52:10.300 --> 52:12.550
Possibility two--

52:12.600 --> 52:14.800
witchcraft.

52:18.800 --> 52:20.950
Leave this body
where it will be found.

52:22.650 --> 52:24.150
You can keep the heart.

52:26.450 --> 52:28.150
Goodnight.

52:45.550 --> 52:46.900
The devil's here.

53:21.350 --> 53:22.750
Go get some sleep.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.200
I don't need to sleep.

53:29.450 --> 53:33.750
I need... a ship.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.250
Maybe have a fuck first.

53:37.300 --> 53:38.550
Find a ship tomorrow.

53:40.900 --> 53:42.950
Why don't you find a captain

53:44.700 --> 53:47.700
and you take him upstairs
and slit his throat,

53:47.750 --> 53:49.150
and I will take his ship?

53:49.200 --> 53:52.500
No captains. No throat-slitting.

53:52.550 --> 53:54.100
We can't find you a ship.

54:09.950 --> 54:11.200
Mine!

54:42.050 --> 54:43.700
I need a ship!

54:45.350 --> 54:47.300
Just give me a fucking ship.

55:05.300 --> 55:07.200
James.

55:07.250 --> 55:09.650
What are you doing?

55:11.400 --> 55:13.750
No. Go away. I'm busy.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.750
I'm not fit to be near you now.

55:25.250 --> 55:26.950
I brought this for you.
