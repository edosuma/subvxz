00:14.304 --> 00:17.514
Look, I'm not talking
like a full makeover, okay?

00:17.516 --> 00:18.850
Just buzz that little
mop top and you let

00:18.852 --> 00:20.810
your stubble come in,
the ladies'll love it.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.270
I have
a wife, remember?

00:23.272 --> 00:24.104
Suit yourself.

00:24.106 --> 00:25.440
Where was I?

00:25.442 --> 00:27.357
Oh yeah, so I'm at
this bougie place

00:27.359 --> 00:29.068
and I want to impress
my date so I order

00:29.070 --> 00:32.113
the pan-seared eel or some shit.

00:32.115 --> 00:35.616
And I knew I shoulda
ordered the burger, you know,

00:35.618 --> 00:37.617
tried and true, shoulda
ordered the burger.

00:37.619 --> 00:39.995
But I didn't Eric,
and let me tell you,

00:39.997 --> 00:42.707
I ate all of that
nasty ass fucking eel

00:42.709 --> 00:45.710
and it was not a good
choice on my part.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.961
And you know what the
moral of the story it?

00:46.963 --> 00:49.714
Just get the burger?

00:49.716 --> 00:51.007
Dude, shut the fuck up,

00:51.009 --> 00:52.132
she thought it
was sophisticated.

00:52.134 --> 00:53.217
It worked.

00:53.219 --> 00:56.220
So you get that eel
and you choke it down.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.388
Ooh, tacos!

00:57.390 --> 00:59.223
Little carne asada
never hurt nobody.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.308
Are we
the only ones here?

01:00.310 --> 01:01.516
Where's the cops?

01:01.518 --> 01:04.269
Eh, we'll be fine.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.276
They stabbed it into my head.

01:11.278 --> 01:13.070
Am I gonna die?

01:13.072 --> 01:15.156
Just a few stitches,
don't you worry buddy.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.365
Not bad at all.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.993
It actually doesn't
hurt that much.

01:19.328 --> 01:20.285
I like your haircut man.

01:20.287 --> 01:21.996
Whoa whoa, wait, hey.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.999
You give us a ride?

01:25.001 --> 01:26.541
Just down the road, real quick.

01:26.543 --> 01:29.252
Oh you fellas want a ride
down the road real quick?

01:29.254 --> 01:31.297
What do we look
like, fucking Uber?

01:31.299 --> 01:32.757
Get the fuck outta here.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.300
Hey, come on man.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.260
Don't be a dick.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.263
Did you just touch me?

01:42.811 --> 01:43.809
He touched me again!

01:43.811 --> 01:44.976
This guy.

01:47.272 --> 01:48.314
Hey, is he a surgeon?

01:50.694 --> 01:53.235
You don't touch other people.

01:53.237 --> 01:56.823
Now you can ride
in the ambulance.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.198
Looking good, buddy.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.032
Be right back.

01:59.034 --> 02:00.578
What, where you going?

02:11.715 --> 02:13.297
Wow.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.134
Yeah!

02:20.556 --> 02:22.347
Who the fuck are these people?

02:22.349 --> 02:24.517
Who wants to ride
in an ambulance, huh?

02:24.519 --> 02:25.353
Come on!

03:01.306 --> 03:02.140
Eric.

03:03.390 --> 03:04.768
What are you doing?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.855
I, uh, had to pick up a shift.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.482
That's two
graveyards this week.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.152
I know, I know.

03:20.616 --> 03:23.826
The kids never see you, my
maternity's up in two weeks,

03:23.828 --> 03:25.330
you can't keep doing this.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.126
Look, it's money, Val.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.876
What do you want me to do?

03:32.878 --> 03:34.381
Say no for once.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.841
It's not that simple.

03:39.468 --> 03:41.513
All of these extra
hours don't help.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.183
I'll talk to Dean,
I'll see what he says.

03:46.975 --> 03:47.811
Okay?

03:50.312 --> 03:51.853
I wish you had just
taken the position

03:51.855 --> 03:53.066
my brother offered you.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.608
I'm trying Val, I'm trying.

03:56.610 --> 03:57.736
Shit.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.491
Just go.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.454
I'll check in later.

04:08.247 --> 04:09.081
Love you.

04:15.254 --> 04:18.214
I'm coming sweetie,
what's the matter?

04:54.043 --> 04:54.877
Hey.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.128
It's me.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.423
Yeah, come on.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.011
Come on come on come on come on.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.848
What are you doing?

05:09.850 --> 05:11.058
No no no.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.392
Don't unzip it
here, you dumbshit.

05:12.394 --> 05:13.728
We have to get to
the drop point.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.855
It's just itchy.

05:17.274 --> 05:19.567
Yeah whatever,
just get in please.

05:20.487 --> 05:24.781
Just go.

05:24.783 --> 05:25.908
What, I'm your chauffeur now?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.077
Buckle up for safety.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.798
Hard part's over.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.925
You should relax.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.594
Think about what you're
gonna do with all that money.

05:47.596 --> 05:48.430
- Huh?
- Huh.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.351
Should be quite a
tidy little sum.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.103
You should travel.

05:56.105 --> 05:56.939
Go to New York.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.776
Santiago, Chile.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.195
There's this amazing theater
festival in Reykjavik.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.447
What are you talking about?

06:06.865 --> 06:08.158
That's right.

06:09.451 --> 06:12.663
You're more of a weed and
video games guy, right?

06:14.833 --> 06:18.712
No, hashish and video games.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.721
Shit.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.557
What is it?

06:33.267 --> 06:36.437
We, my friend,
are being followed.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.776
My buddy's
an RN at the hospital.

06:44.778 --> 06:46.611
I guess they had to
leave a couple shards

06:46.613 --> 06:48.990
of the beer bottle
in that guy's skull.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.617
I mean,
can you imagine?

06:59.418 --> 07:00.334
Think we can
get through the night

07:00.336 --> 07:01.586
without punching anyone else?

07:01.588 --> 07:02.878
Hey, that
wasn't our fault man.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.546
A, there shoulda been
police there to begin with.

07:04.548 --> 07:06.673
B, we did what we had to do.

07:06.675 --> 07:08.302
I mean those pricks
had it coming.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.514
Hey, did you put me
on the schedule tonight?

07:13.516 --> 07:15.058
Yeah, but I'll do it later.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.478
'Cause paycheck was a
little light last month.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.774
I think you forgot a few shifts.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.733
You sure?

07:23.735 --> 07:24.569
Uh huh.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.529
Hey so Bravo's gonna
need a new timing belt.

07:29.531 --> 07:30.697
Oh shit.

07:30.699 --> 07:32.199
Is she good to go for tonight?

07:32.201 --> 07:33.034
Maybe.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.827
Pushing it though.

07:34.829 --> 07:35.661
Cool.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.454
Watch this.

07:37.456 --> 07:38.290
Oh!

07:41.002 --> 07:45.462
You know, I mean,
I can't keep track

07:45.464 --> 07:47.464
of everybody's paycheck,
you know what I mean?

07:47.466 --> 07:48.716
- Right.
- It's not like

07:48.718 --> 07:49.634
- I have an assistant.
- Uh huh, right.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.926
Can't afford it, you know?

07:50.928 --> 07:52.219
I would love to have this
place with like five assistants

07:52.221 --> 07:53.053
but while we're at
it why don't we just

07:53.055 --> 07:54.346
get a hot tub in here?

07:54.348 --> 07:55.682
Whoa, that's an excellent idea.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.724
I mean nothing too fancy,
just like a basic four seater.

07:59.062 --> 07:59.894
All units, structure
fire at La Brea, repeat.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.396
Should we take that?

08:01.398 --> 08:02.647
No, it's too far.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.981
You know what I mean?

08:03.983 --> 08:07.276
In a perfect world we'd have
like five assistants, you know?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.611
If there's a minute
tonight there's one thing

08:09.613 --> 08:11.907
I wanted to talk about.

08:12.908 --> 08:13.949
Promotion?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.702
Yeah actually.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.620
If it's on the table.

08:18.622 --> 08:20.373
Let me think about it.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.375
All available
units be sent out to San Pedro.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.750
Is that us?

08:23.752 --> 08:24.668
- Single vehicle crash...
- That's ours, that's us!

08:24.670 --> 08:25.586
Injuries reported.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.421
Brie, you got Bravo tonight.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.587
Okay, got it.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.550
Reuben, get the
fuck off your phone

08:32.760 --> 08:34.761
I'm cleaning,
not on the phone.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.059
Unit nine responding.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.852
Repeat, unit nine responding.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.439
Copy unit
nine, go for it.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.358
Let's rock and roll.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.501
Alright, you win.

09:05.669 --> 09:08.673
I thought about it and congrats.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.675
You're our new lead EMT.

09:13.677 --> 09:15.636
Wow, cool.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.554
Yeah, that is cool.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.597
But what does that mean?

09:17.599 --> 09:18.848
What does it mean?

09:18.850 --> 09:19.848
I mean what does
that title come with?

09:19.850 --> 09:20.682
Pride.

09:20.684 --> 09:21.642
Fucking honor.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.268
Maybe a little more
responsibility.

09:23.270 --> 09:25.103
Why, was there something
else you were looking for?

09:25.105 --> 09:26.647
A raise would be nice.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.690
Ooh, well you know
where the company's at.

09:28.692 --> 09:30.818
And in this economy, oof.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.195
And don't say the economy's fine

09:32.197 --> 09:35.406
'cause that's just
liberal media bullshit.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.951
Thing is, Sam's still sick.

09:38.787 --> 09:39.868
You know this.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.161
We still haven't dug outta that.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.704
With the hours that
we work, I just never

09:42.706 --> 09:44.668
get to spend time with
the family anymore.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.794
It's not fair to them.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.047
You'll be fine.

09:50.130 --> 09:52.924
How old is Darla now anyway?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.342
- Nora.
- Nora?

09:54.344 --> 09:55.634
You're her godfather!

09:55.636 --> 09:56.969
She's four months old.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.180
Right, right, I
knew that, whatever.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.807
Here's the thing, listen.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.767
I was married once, I know
how old that shit gets.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.478
And I'll be honest,
I wasn't good at it.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.813
I was a horrible husband.

10:06.815 --> 10:07.939
I would have been
an even worse dad.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.398
But out here, I'm a hero.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.983
You and me, we save lives dude.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.819
And that's what
it's about, right?

10:12.821 --> 10:14.403
You're missing my point, man.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.570
So you're all
about the paycheck.

10:15.572 --> 10:16.906
- No, it's not.
- Prove it.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.031
I mean tell me why
you're doing this.

10:18.033 --> 10:18.866
You know I love this job.

10:18.868 --> 10:19.783
I don't know.

10:19.785 --> 10:20.785
Do I know that?

10:20.787 --> 10:21.703
Prove it to me.

10:21.705 --> 10:22.956
Tell me why you took this job.

10:24.164 --> 10:25.498
- Well...
- Turn, turn left!

10:25.500 --> 10:27.791
Turn, right here, turn
and get your head back

10:27.793 --> 10:32.798
in the fucking game.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.677
Alright buddy, look sharp.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.513
I got it.

10:42.182 --> 10:43.766
Oh look out now.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.727
Bullshit elite is on the case.

10:45.729 --> 10:46.978
Ef the fuck off, Max.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.478
Took you ladies long enough.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.605
Well I had to let
your mom cum too.

10:50.607 --> 10:51.940
I'm a fucking gentleman.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.651
Okay fellas,
focus, come on,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.361
get in there, do your job.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.655
- Sorry Chief, what do we got?
- Okay the driver

10:57.657 --> 11:00.491
should be okay, we'll wait
for another ambulance for him.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.953
Passenger's walking towards
the light, he's your priority.

11:03.955 --> 11:04.996
Oh fuck.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.622
Alright, let's get
that stretcher.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.750
One, two, three.

11:09.753 --> 11:10.792
Yo Chief, can we get an assist?

11:10.794 --> 11:12.962
This guy's not gonna
make it to the ER.

11:12.964 --> 11:13.879
Max, help 'em out.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.131
- No B-teamer.
- Chief.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.632
Come on, gimme someone good!

11:16.634 --> 11:17.842
You're gonna kill this guy!

11:17.844 --> 11:19.259
Chief, I'm finishing a double.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.887
This is how
you end the double.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.307
Give 'em a hand.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.773
Jesus, look at
this death trap.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.276
How are you still
in business, man?

11:35.445 --> 11:37.612
How do
you find your dick?

11:42.534 --> 11:44.868
I mean, I'm a loss right now.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.871
I mean it's just
not working out.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.498
I told you, I told
you a million times,

11:48.500 --> 11:49.873
don't get so close
to the car man.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.086
This is not the time to
play the blame game, alright?

11:53.212 --> 11:54.712
You call him, I'm not doing it.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.508
No way, I'm not
calling his ass.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.765
Dude, is this
thing street legal?

12:07.143 --> 12:08.392
Stop talking shit
about my lift, alright?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.768
Danger One has
never let me down.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.978
- Danger One.
- Yeah, it's her code name.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.063
I mean it's a lot
better than calling 'em

12:12.065 --> 12:13.940
jalopy piece of shit
one and two, right?

12:13.942 --> 12:15.108
You haven't changed a bit man.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.776
Hey, whoa, whoa, he's bleeding.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.027
Inside, right, internal?

12:19.029 --> 12:21.238
No no no, like he's
bleeding heavily.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.323
Oh, alright, let's
cut his clothes off.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.532
Yeah.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.825
- Alright man, fluids.
- Yeah, got it.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.536
- Let's get an IV going.
- What's going on back there?

12:26.538 --> 12:28.161
Look man, I'm not
trying to get on your case.

12:28.163 --> 12:31.666
It's just you don't even
have the right gear in here.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.041
Jacket's a bitch.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.045
This would never
fly on an LAFD rig.

12:37.756 --> 12:38.590
Where are we?

12:40.759 --> 12:43.051
- Dean?
- Holy shit.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.594
- What?
- How bad is it?

12:44.596 --> 12:53.979
We got a puncture wound
just below the ribs.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.232
Holy shit.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.446
What the fuck?

13:01.614 --> 13:02.449
Holy shit.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.742
He's in V fib!

13:05.744 --> 13:07.743
80 over 40, blood
pressure dropping quick.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.786
Asystole, pushing
chest compressions.

13:09.788 --> 13:10.787
Alright, here we go.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.080
Shit.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.166
Pull over,
come on, right here.

13:13.168 --> 13:25.344
- Alright, hold on, hold on.
- Pull over.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.477
Goddamnit.

13:32.854 --> 13:33.687
Come on.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.067
Son of a bitch.

13:39.110 --> 13:39.943
Alrighty, thanks.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.447
ER called it, it's a wrap.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.097
Ooh, he is pissed.

14:09.099 --> 14:12.099
I mean I told you,
I mean, I told you.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.017
I'm not, I'm not doing
this with you right now.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.689
Mm hmm.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.149
Oh shit, here we go.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.276
Somebody wanna tell me
that's not the mule's ride?

14:23.278 --> 14:25.532
Somebody wanna tell me
I'm just seeing shit?

14:26.990 --> 14:29.825
We tailed 'em from the
airport, eastbound on the 10,

14:29.827 --> 14:33.161
low profile, it was textbook.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.955
But they musta made us
'cause they took an exit

14:34.957 --> 14:36.623
and just floored it.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.166
By the time we caught up,
they were already wrecked.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.877
Either of 'em make it?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.878
The ambulance just
picked up the passenger.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.047
The driver seems okay,
they're patching him up

14:44.049 --> 14:44.883
on the sidewalk.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.971
It's Akkerman's
main guy, Craddock.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.223
Really?

14:53.475 --> 14:55.100
Uh, sir?

14:55.102 --> 14:57.479
We should probably
call this off, right?

15:00.107 --> 15:02.358
Absolutely not.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.401
We've been tracking this
operation for months.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.070
If Craddock's here,
this is a big shipment.

15:07.072 --> 15:10.116
It's either in the car or
still on the passenger.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.408
University
Hospital's the closest.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.535
Well then get over there.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.078
Call me if he wakes up.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.287
Call me if he doesn't wake up.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.080
Call me if he
dies, just call me.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.583
I'm gonna check this car.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.871
God, it's all hundreds.

15:56.873 --> 15:57.789
Should you be touching that?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.081
It's okay, I got gloves on.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.541
Not what I meant.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.799
Makes you wonder, don't it?

16:07.341 --> 16:08.299
Who this guy was?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.134
No.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.804
Why they're bagged up like this.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.638
And how much is in there.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.932
Just let
the police count it.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.352
I mean you're not even
like a little bit curious?

16:19.354 --> 16:20.980
Gotta be over 100K, man.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.108
You know I could use 100,000.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.818
Buy a fucking toothbrush?

16:26.820 --> 16:29.152
Shit, more than that man.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.195
Look, we didn't see it, okay?

16:30.197 --> 16:31.113
Just put it back.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.701
But we did see it, Eric.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.243
We had to cut his coat off.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.829
Thank you.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.541
It's not like we went
through his wallet.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.545
What?

16:46.047 --> 16:47.254
Fuck me.

16:47.256 --> 16:54.262
What, what is it?

16:54.264 --> 16:57.017
Homeboy somehow jammed
a million dollars here.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.104
Hey, we're almost there.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.692
Just let the hospital
deal with it.

17:15.992 --> 17:19.786
Let's just imagine,
for a moment.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.790
Let's say we don't turn it in.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.791
And we just keep it.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.710
I'm not hearing this.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.380
I'm not hearing this.

17:31.134 --> 17:35.303
Unit nine,
requesting an ETA.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.139
One minute.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.101
You report that stuff the moment
you walk through the door.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.741
- How's he doing?
- Don't know yet.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.659
He come to yet?

17:58.661 --> 17:59.662
No, not yet.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.586
Sir, sir, you've
been in a car accident.

18:09.673 --> 18:13.132
Sir, lay down.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.635
Where is he, where is he?

18:15.845 --> 18:17.303
Your friend, he's been
taken to the hospital.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.847
We will take you there
as soon as we can.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.267
Lie down sir, please.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.354
I'm gonna go see
what's going on,

18:27.356 --> 18:28.648
I'll be right back.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.691
Don't
worry, I got this.

18:30.693 --> 18:31.984
Immigration and customs.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.611
We didn't step into one
of your cases, did we?

18:33.613 --> 18:34.655
I'm not sure yet.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.240
Um, Officer Wilson,
do you mind if I spoke

18:38.242 --> 18:40.075
to the driver real quick?

18:40.077 --> 18:41.451
Sure.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.287
He's all banged up but you
can talk to him if you want.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.873
Hey!

18:45.875 --> 18:46.710
What?

18:49.546 --> 18:51.796
Oh, what the fuck?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.256
- Where did he go?
- I thought he was

18:53.258 --> 18:54.215
just laying there,
I didn't know!

18:54.217 --> 18:55.549
I know he was just here.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.134
What he jumped up, a
magician or something?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.510
- Have you been drinking?
- He's got to be here

18:58.512 --> 19:02.516
- somewhere, I'm not drinking!
- Because I can smell it!

19:08.147 --> 19:34.838
We'll finish the sign-off
Eric, you sit tight.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.466
Look at this fucking guy.

19:36.468 --> 19:37.302
Busted.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.219
I was just looking at it.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.845
Oh yeah, no no no, I
know it's tempting, right?

19:41.847 --> 19:44.222
So what happened in there?

19:44.224 --> 19:45.266
What'd they say?

19:45.268 --> 19:47.392
Oh, they said that
we could keep it.

19:47.394 --> 19:50.520
So you guys didn't
report anything?

19:50.522 --> 19:53.106
I don't remember us all
agreeing to report it.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.735
I don't remember us
agreeing to keep it.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.071
This is crazy.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.197
- What are you guys talking...
- Hey, listen, listen,

19:59.199 --> 20:00.489
listen, listen.

20:00.491 --> 20:03.284
Split three ways it's
over $300,000 each.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.576
Leaving that on the table

20:04.578 --> 20:07.205
without at least talking
about it first, that's crazy.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.041
Mm hmm.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.708
Listen to me.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.168
No one goes around with
money hidden on 'em like that

20:12.170 --> 20:13.460
unless they're smuggling it.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.254
And anyone who's
doing that isn't,

20:15.256 --> 20:17.297
they're doing something that
aint on the up and up, right?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.382
- Exactly.
- Right.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.676
- You're making my point.
- I know.

20:19.678 --> 20:20.593
Is what
you're saying supposed

20:20.595 --> 20:21.885
to make me feel any better?

20:21.887 --> 20:22.719
- Wait, hear me out.
- 'Cause it's not.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.389
Hear me out!

20:24.391 --> 20:25.890
Who does this money belong to?

20:25.892 --> 20:27.307
- Not him.
- Probably a drug cartel.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.518
Maybe, probably, probably.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.894
But are they gonna
go to the cops

20:30.896 --> 20:32.354
and tell them that someone
jacked their drug money?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.815
Fuck no.

20:33.817 --> 20:34.649
This shit is free cash.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.025
What about the driver?

20:36.027 --> 20:37.401
- The old man?
- Huh, yeah.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.819
He got knocked out.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.488
Yeah.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.530
And what, like he's gonna
wake up in the hospital

20:41.532 --> 20:43.032
and be like oh shit,
where's my money

20:43.034 --> 20:44.366
that my dead friend
was smuggling?

20:44.368 --> 20:45.535
I better go report
it to the police

20:45.537 --> 20:46.661
and incriminate myself.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.246
Anyone that was
involved in this

20:48.248 --> 20:50.748
is gonna cut their losses
and walk away, man.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.334
They're gonna assume that
the police, they seized it.

20:53.336 --> 20:54.751
Yes.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.086
- What about the cops then?
- Dude, if they knew about it

20:56.088 --> 20:57.421
they'd have been up
our ass the second

20:57.423 --> 20:58.799
we pulled this guy
out of the car.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.970
Fuck this, I'm turning it in.

21:04.972 --> 21:05.807
No!

21:07.558 --> 21:10.058
You're not listening.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.895
Max, buddy, hey, let go.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.153
Eric.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.362
We're not gonna let you do it.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.573
Max and I, we got this handled.

21:23.575 --> 21:24.907
Right Max?

21:24.909 --> 21:25.744
Yeah.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.578
We split it three ways
and we don't tell anybody.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.456
That's your plan?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.458
Fine, what would you do?

21:33.460 --> 21:34.584
I don't want any part of this.

21:34.586 --> 21:35.459
This is all you.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.710
Really?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.296
'Cause if I get caught,
you're out of a job.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.671
Did you think about that?

21:39.673 --> 21:41.341
And if I don't take this
money you're out of a job.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.799
Man I don't know how
long I'm gonna keep

21:42.801 --> 21:45.135
Turbo Elite afloat, you know?

21:45.137 --> 21:48.432
So like I said, if you've got
a better plan, let's hear it.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.026
Alright.

22:00.528 --> 22:01.945
We finish our shifts tonight.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.700
Like nothing happened.

22:06.867 --> 22:10.870
And then tomorrow we come
straight back to work.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.287
And then we split the money.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.331
Wait a couple days.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.623
No, months.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.459
Make sure nothing's fishy.

22:16.461 --> 22:20.380
No big deposits,
no big purchases.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.798
You know what,
he's right, we wait.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.926
We make sure that no one is
actually looking for the money.

22:25.761 --> 22:26.596
Max?

22:28.640 --> 22:30.722
My ride's here to
take me to the station.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.807
Okay, are you cool with this?

22:31.809 --> 22:33.185
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Okay.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.063
One thing before I leave.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.606
Dean, you know I
was serving in Iraq.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.650
Yeah.

22:40.652 --> 22:43.151
Eric, did you know
that I served in Iraq?

22:43.153 --> 22:43.988
No.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.990
Ramadi, Fallujah.

22:49.618 --> 22:50.869
Operation Phantom Fury.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.125
That's where it got easy.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.294
Mm hmm.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.046
What got easy?

23:01.381 --> 23:02.215
Killing.

23:06.594 --> 23:10.807
So, if you two dinks are
thinking about fucking me over,

23:14.184 --> 23:19.896
I'd think again.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.986
Oh man, you should
see your faces!

23:24.988 --> 23:28.030
- Ha.
- Beautiful, beautiful.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.533
Alright buddy.

23:30.535 --> 23:31.952
Alright.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.842
Goddamnit.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.471
Oh great, perfect timing.

23:50.637 --> 23:51.636
I gotta get outta here.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.721
Can I have the keys?

23:52.723 --> 23:54.097
- This your car?
- Yeah.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.391
I can't give you the keys
without taking a receipt...

23:55.393 --> 23:56.642
Sure guy but just
give me the keys.

23:56.644 --> 23:57.684
I can't give you the keys.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.603
Ticket?

23:58.605 --> 23:59.437
Okay, I'll do that afterwards

23:59.439 --> 24:00.270
so gimme the keys.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.146
Do you have a ticket?

24:01.148 --> 24:02.481
Okay, I think it's in the car.

24:02.483 --> 24:03.900
I can't without
a ticket, just...

24:03.902 --> 24:05.234
Give it to me, I'll get
the ticket, it's in the car.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.568
No, I mean I need
a ticket in order...

24:06.570 --> 24:08.153
Just hand me the keys,
can I do it on the way out?

24:08.155 --> 24:09.447
But I can't give you
the key without a ticket.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.280
Yeah you can, just
give me the keys.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.449
No I need a ticket.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.408
I know, I know,
just give me the keys.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.241
I need a...

24:16.247 --> 24:17.248
Fuck, sorry.

24:21.711 --> 24:22.919
May I have the keys?

24:22.921 --> 24:23.755
Thanks.

24:24.713 --> 24:25.714
You alright?

24:41.021 --> 24:42.438
There's only
two of these keys.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.606
One for me and one for you.

24:44.608 --> 24:45.901
No, I'm good.

24:48.779 --> 24:49.987
You know that old saying

24:49.989 --> 24:51.825
don't look a gift
horse in the mouth?

24:53.034 --> 24:54.449
Yeah.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.576
Basically it
means when someone

24:56.578 --> 24:59.624
gives you a nice gift, you
don't act like a little bitch.

25:02.711 --> 25:04.126
Okay.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.836
I don't know if it was
god or some karma shit

25:05.838 --> 25:07.671
but someone gave us a
really nice gift tonight

25:07.673 --> 25:09.590
and you're acting
like a little bitch.

25:09.592 --> 25:12.051
First of all, nobody
gave us that money.

25:12.053 --> 25:15.054
We, no, you took it.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.555
I mean you always
play it safe Eric

25:16.557 --> 25:18.518
but tonight that
is going to change.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.524
My pop was an old
school fireman.

25:26.608 --> 25:27.568
My brothers, my uncles.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.194
That's all I wanted to be.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.029
You know?

25:32.031 --> 25:34.073
Then I got hurt.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.284
So I had to hang it up.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.786
Stop me if you've heard
this story before.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.456
Okay, stop.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.165
Anyway, I knew I could
build a company like this.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.293
I knew it would be a
huge risk but I also knew

25:45.295 --> 25:47.711
that I had the training
and I had the balls

25:47.713 --> 25:51.048
so I jumped in feet first,
savings, pension, boom, gone,

25:51.050 --> 25:55.094
scrawled out some checks, and
Turbo Elite Ambulance Company

25:55.096 --> 25:55.930
was born.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.472
Clearly it's paid off.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.892
You ever ask yourself why
this place is such a dump?

26:03.480 --> 26:05.065
The dickheads
down at city hall.

26:14.782 --> 26:16.615
I spent most of my
money just trying to get

26:16.617 --> 26:18.284
the shit up to code.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.786
I had nothing left to
finish rehabbing it.

26:20.788 --> 26:23.163
Ambulances I bought, these
two pieces of shit Fords

26:23.165 --> 26:24.790
that I bought out in
Corona from some guy

26:24.792 --> 26:28.126
with no fucking nose, you know,
tall ass cowboy douche bag,

26:28.128 --> 26:30.004
big white teeth,
no fucking nose.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.631
If I didn't have a nose
I'd stay in my house,

26:31.633 --> 26:32.840
I'd never come out.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.758
Fucking wear a mask or
something, you know what I mean?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.052
This guy's out
there loud and proud

26:36.054 --> 26:38.261
selling used trucks
and ambulances,

26:38.263 --> 26:40.640
goddamn hole in
his fucking face!

26:40.642 --> 26:41.476
Dean.

26:43.144 --> 26:46.021
They owed me and
they screwed me

26:47.565 --> 26:51.526
and the way I see it, it's
all coming back around.

26:51.528 --> 26:54.277
Next ambulance I buy is
gonna be a fucking brand new

26:54.279 --> 26:56.905
Chevy 3500 turbo diesel
and I'm gonna buy it

26:56.907 --> 26:59.866
from a real fucking
automobile salesman, you know?

26:59.868 --> 27:03.078
The kind with too much
product in his hair

27:03.080 --> 27:05.664
and a big fucking awesome suit.

27:05.666 --> 27:06.498
You know?

27:07.335 --> 27:08.709
Eh, that guy!

27:08.711 --> 27:10.920
With this money, you
and me, we're gonna make

27:10.922 --> 27:13.463
this company twice the
company that I had envisioned

27:13.465 --> 27:14.673
the first time.

27:14.675 --> 27:15.926
Me and my best friend Eric.

27:17.178 --> 27:20.388
No longer the mentor
and the student but

27:20.390 --> 27:21.266
business partners.

27:31.859 --> 27:34.026
Thank god Craddock,
you're okay I think.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.361
But the money?

27:35.363 --> 27:37.113
Let me guess, you've lost it.

27:37.115 --> 27:41.950
Not exactly, it's
still on Rami, my guy.

27:41.952 --> 27:44.786
I'm en route to the
hospital now as we speak.

27:44.788 --> 27:45.787
And then what?

27:45.789 --> 27:46.788
You think they'll have
it waiting for you

27:46.790 --> 27:48.540
at the lost and found?

27:48.542 --> 27:50.293
This is completely unacceptable.

27:50.295 --> 27:52.295
Silas, trust me, I
have it under control.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.671
I'll be waiting.

27:53.673 --> 27:58.801
Don't disappoint me JJ.

27:58.803 --> 28:01.511
We talked to the
nurses, the head surgeon,

28:01.513 --> 28:04.097
even played back the
security cam footage for us.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.600
Nothing.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.101
If somebody boosted
that money it happened

28:07.103 --> 28:09.522
before they wheeled the dead
guy through these doors.

28:10.690 --> 28:11.980
What about the driver?

28:11.982 --> 28:13.524
Before he bailed did
you see if he had

28:13.526 --> 28:15.153
maybe a bag on him or something?

28:17.780 --> 28:18.615
You see that?

28:19.490 --> 28:22.949
Plastic lining.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.913
I don't think we're
looking for a bag.

28:26.455 --> 28:27.331
You guys.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.833
You wanna see another dead body?

28:30.835 --> 28:31.670
No.

28:33.421 --> 28:36.421
I got a good one in one.

28:36.423 --> 28:45.097
Man's missing his testicles.

28:45.099 --> 28:46.306
So that's it?

28:46.308 --> 28:47.808
We're just gonna
give up on the score?

28:47.810 --> 28:49.686
I didn't say that.

28:49.688 --> 28:50.814
So then what's the plan?

28:53.857 --> 28:55.650
First responders.

28:55.652 --> 28:56.778
Let's check the paperwork.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.366
10-4, unit
six, on our way, over.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.328
Here, you can just breathe
through this normally.

29:11.875 --> 29:12.711
Hey.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.465
I know I, uh, came on
a little strong before.

29:20.343 --> 29:23.052
You know, this company's
all I got, man.

29:23.054 --> 29:25.682
You don't gotta invest in
me if you don't wanna, okay?

29:26.891 --> 29:28.766
Look.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.562
I just want tonight to be over.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.482
I wanna go home to my
family and that's it.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.151
- Okay?
- Okay.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.448
How are you feeling?

29:43.532 --> 29:44.907
Is she gonna be okay?

29:44.909 --> 29:46.119
She's gonna be just fine.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.079
Thank you.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.457
Honey, you scared me.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.042
You just saved that family.

29:54.044 --> 29:55.459
Dad's on his way home.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.919
Now save your own.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.046
Let's get
you in bed, okay?

29:59.048 --> 30:01.591
That's lame even
for you, Dean.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.235
With this
thing I got going baby

30:21.237 --> 30:22.697
we could go anywhere.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.530
We could go to Alaska.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.991
No, try again.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.163
Someplace warmer and sunnier.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.625
How about Cancun?

30:35.835 --> 30:37.168
Come on, we're
not on spring break.

30:37.170 --> 30:42.175
Max.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.133
How you doing?

30:45.135 --> 30:46.594
- Agent Beckwith.
- ICE.

30:46.596 --> 30:47.804
Sorry to interrupt your game,

30:47.806 --> 30:49.055
just a couple of questions.

30:49.057 --> 30:53.937
Listen, that nasty
accident over on San Pedro.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.774
You rode in the ambulance,
that was your signature, right?

31:02.319 --> 31:03.654
Why don't we chat outside?

31:23.758 --> 31:25.341
You look dead.

31:25.343 --> 31:26.177
Hey.

31:27.804 --> 31:28.721
Wakey wakey.

31:30.181 --> 31:31.514
You want a little pick me up?

31:31.516 --> 31:36.227
I think I've had enough
coffee for one day.

31:36.229 --> 31:43.484
How about something
that's not coffee?

31:43.486 --> 31:45.068
I'm good.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.452
You're still on edge.

31:53.454 --> 31:55.205
No, no, Mm-mm.

31:58.585 --> 31:59.794
Something happen tonight?

32:02.797 --> 32:07.174
No, no.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.136
You know you can
talk to me, right?

32:11.096 --> 32:12.764
Mm hmm.

32:12.766 --> 32:15.807
You know you can trust me.

32:15.809 --> 32:20.815
You can tell me anything.

32:21.106 --> 32:28.653
Right?

32:28.655 --> 32:29.531
Talk to me.

32:31.451 --> 32:34.035
This is not a
good idea, this is...

32:34.037 --> 32:34.871
Shh.

32:39.084 --> 32:40.043
It'll be fine.

32:46.090 --> 32:49.677
Look I told you before,
I just can't do this.

32:51.136 --> 32:51.971
Okay.

32:56.558 --> 32:57.476
- Hey Brie?
- Hmm?

32:59.813 --> 33:02.063
Look that crash
tonight, Dean and I we...

33:03.482 --> 33:06.066
All units report
a stabbing on Mateo and 8th.

33:07.069 --> 33:08.443
You know what?

33:08.445 --> 33:09.903
Reuben and I, we got your
back on this call, okay?

33:09.905 --> 33:11.322
You just stay here.

33:11.324 --> 33:12.448
Tell me later.

33:12.450 --> 33:13.951
Yo Reuben, let's go.

33:23.211 --> 33:26.006
- Unit six responding, over.
- 10-4.

33:29.299 --> 33:30.882
Come on, don't
do this to me now.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.260
Fucker come on!

33:33.262 --> 33:34.511
Want some gas, yeah?

33:34.513 --> 33:37.599
Well looks like she
finally shit the bed.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.109
Fuckin' A.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.485
Eric!

33:49.487 --> 33:50.737
Oh man.

33:50.739 --> 33:55.991
We're gonna have
to take Danger One.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.995
Uh, no no no no, no don't
do that, you can't do that.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.287
- What, why?
- No.

34:00.289 --> 34:01.913
Dean should be
coming right back.

34:01.915 --> 34:04.292
We'll take care of it,
don't worry, it's fine.

34:04.294 --> 34:05.584
But I already
said Reuben and I...

34:05.586 --> 34:06.835
Uh, let me just go
outside and check for Dean

34:06.837 --> 34:08.253
and see when he's
coming back, alright?

34:08.255 --> 34:09.963
Just don't go anywhere.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.297
Alright I'll be right back.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.467
The fuck is his problem?

34:13.469 --> 34:14.303
I dunno.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.554
Look, Max called.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.599
Cops or feds or somebody
just questioned him

34:20.601 --> 34:22.559
- and he's freaking out.
- What?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.186
We gotta keep
our shit together

34:24.188 --> 34:25.728
in case we gotta talk
him off the ledge

34:25.731 --> 34:27.233
before he does something stupid.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.318
Where's Danger One?

34:30.320 --> 34:31.693
Oh, I was trying to tell you.

34:31.695 --> 34:35.322
Fuckin' call came in,
Bravo wouldn't start,

34:35.324 --> 34:37.367
- and Brie went right off.
- Brie just took it?

34:37.369 --> 34:40.952
The money was on there.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.996
Why didn't you ride with them?

34:42.998 --> 34:44.000
She wouldn't wait!

34:56.971 --> 34:57.806
Hey, Max.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.057
- Where's Dean?
- Hold on.

35:01.059 --> 35:05.061
Max, hold on, Max, Max,
wait up, wait up, hold on.

35:05.063 --> 35:06.688
Wait a sec, wait a second.

35:06.690 --> 35:07.688
Where the fuck is he?

35:07.690 --> 35:08.731
I'm over here, what's up Max?

35:08.733 --> 35:10.023
Where is it Dean?

35:10.025 --> 35:10.858
I wanna see it.

35:10.860 --> 35:12.110
Look, it's safe, okay?

35:12.112 --> 35:12.945
I wasn't fucking
talking to you.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.280
Hey man, relax, it's all good.

35:16.282 --> 35:19.577
He's telling the truth,
it's in a safe place and so.

35:23.373 --> 35:25.458
What happened with the feds?

35:26.960 --> 35:28.583
It wasn't the
feds, it was ICE.

35:28.585 --> 35:29.668
- ICE?
- Yeah.

35:29.670 --> 35:31.336
Immigration and customs.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.880
They're part of some task force

35:32.882 --> 35:35.215
tracking money being smuggled
in and out of airports.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.175
They knew that the
guy that we picked up

35:37.177 --> 35:38.427
was gonna have cash on him.

35:38.429 --> 35:40.304
They were fucking following him!

35:40.306 --> 35:41.347
So you see what I'm saying?

35:41.349 --> 35:43.266
They know about the
fucking money, man.

35:43.268 --> 35:44.934
It's only a matter of time
before they connect the dots

35:44.936 --> 35:49.731
and we're fucked.

35:49.733 --> 35:50.567
Dean!

35:51.735 --> 35:53.818
We're sticking with the plan.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.697
The fucking plan,
your fucking plan.

35:57.574 --> 36:00.615
Look I don't give a shit
what you assholes do.

36:00.617 --> 36:03.871
But I'm taking my cut and I'm
getting the fuck outta here.

36:05.748 --> 36:07.039
Where?

36:07.041 --> 36:10.668
Out man, like
fucking out, gone!

36:10.670 --> 36:12.836
Look, going out half-cocked,
it's a good way to get...

36:12.838 --> 36:14.338
I'm not going to
fucking jail, man.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.924
So give me my cut right now.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.516
We can't.

36:25.726 --> 36:30.229
What are you trying to pull?

36:30.231 --> 36:31.606
I'm not fucking stupid, man.

36:31.608 --> 36:35.400
We can't give you your
money because it's not here.

36:35.402 --> 36:36.945
Motherfucker.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.117
They'll bring it back,
okay, they're gonna...

36:43.119 --> 36:43.952
They?

36:45.204 --> 36:46.496
They, who the fuck are they?

36:46.498 --> 36:47.412
- Shut up!
- Hey!

36:47.414 --> 36:48.246
Give me my fucking money!

36:48.248 --> 36:49.081
What are you doing?

36:49.083 --> 36:50.124
Max, listen to me.

36:50.126 --> 36:51.458
- Jesus.
- Where's my fucking money?

36:51.460 --> 36:52.626
- You son of a bitch.
- Max, chill, easy.

36:52.628 --> 36:55.128
No, I'm gonna fucking
warn you, I'll kill you.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.924
I'll kill both of you.

36:58.385 --> 37:00.385
- You crazy fuck, get off me.
- Get off him, Max!

37:00.387 --> 37:05.307
Get off me!

37:08.311 --> 37:09.476
Fucking dead, Dean!

37:09.478 --> 37:10.769
Listen to me, man.

37:10.771 --> 37:13.271
The money's out on the
other fucking rig, okay?

37:13.273 --> 37:14.731
It's coming right back.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.608
This isn't a fucking scam, man,

37:16.610 --> 37:17.651
it's an honest mix up, alright?

37:17.653 --> 37:19.112
Stop fucking lying to me, man!

37:19.114 --> 37:19.945
I'm not pulling
something on you, man!

37:19.947 --> 37:21.322
Stop fucking lying to me!

37:21.324 --> 37:23.740
You're fucking
crazy, you're fucking crazy!

37:23.742 --> 37:25.159
You're fucking dead man.

37:25.161 --> 37:27.494
I'm not pulling
something on you man.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.037
- You're fucking dead.
- Why would I do that?

37:30.166 --> 37:31.749
You're fucking dead!

37:33.460 --> 37:34.294
God!

37:35.463 --> 37:37.588
Whoa, you okay, you alright?

37:37.590 --> 37:40.550
- Christ!
- Try to rip me off?

37:40.552 --> 37:41.550
Stop!

37:41.552 --> 37:43.052
Stop!

37:43.054 --> 37:45.724
Stop shooting,
no, stop shooting!

37:46.724 --> 37:47.974
Jesus!

37:47.976 --> 37:50.309
Fuck this shit!

38:14.878 --> 38:15.879
Oh my god.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.589
Dean, what did you do?

38:20.759 --> 38:23.008
What do you mean what'd I do?

38:23.010 --> 38:25.096
I fucking saved your ass.

38:35.856 --> 38:41.401
Okay, we can fix this,
okay, we can make it better.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.445
We can...

38:42.447 --> 38:57.959
Oh, oh, oh!

38:57.961 --> 38:58.797
So?

39:11.851 --> 39:16.604
Hey...

39:16.606 --> 39:17.440
You okay?

39:18.565 --> 39:20.608
Look what you just
fucking did to this guy.

39:20.610 --> 39:22.568
Yeah, shit.

39:24.989 --> 39:26.280
Oh, your arm.

39:26.282 --> 39:27.490
- Uh...
- Dude fuck my arm.

39:27.492 --> 39:28.907
No man.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.536
Oh fuck it, I'll
fucking do it later.

39:31.996 --> 39:33.787
What are we gonna do?

39:33.789 --> 39:36.331
I don't know, but we're
not gonna turn ourselves in.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.043
We're so fucking past the
point of no return right now.

39:39.045 --> 39:40.545
Alright, don't even...

39:40.547 --> 39:43.463
Hey guys,
we're on our way back.

39:43.465 --> 39:44.673
That's right so

39:44.675 --> 39:46.469
take that dick out
your mouth bro.

39:50.724 --> 39:52.350
We gotta clean this shit up.

39:55.353 --> 39:56.644
Dude!

39:56.646 --> 39:58.648
We're gonna clean
this shit up, okay?

40:11.077 --> 40:12.078
Let's see.

40:15.123 --> 40:15.999
You got it?

40:26.550 --> 40:27.384
Hmm.

40:40.356 --> 40:41.688
Rami didn't make it.

40:41.690 --> 40:43.691
Right
dear unfortunate.

40:43.693 --> 40:45.568
And I found the
money, I got your money.

40:45.570 --> 40:46.610
Splendid.

40:46.612 --> 40:49.322
Well, I mean, that
is to say at this point

40:49.324 --> 40:50.947
it's just merely a
matter of retrieval.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.700
Well I see
where this is headed,

40:52.702 --> 40:53.659
I'll make some calls.

40:53.661 --> 40:55.077
Don't do that, don't, please...

40:55.079 --> 40:56.579
I can't have you
running around all night

40:56.581 --> 40:58.456
making things worse, JJ.

40:58.458 --> 41:01.795
Come back here and
we'll sort you down.

41:02.836 --> 41:03.672
Alright?

41:39.666 --> 41:41.164
You about done over there?

41:41.166 --> 41:42.666
Dean.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.586
I'm not getting on your
case, just running out of time.

41:45.588 --> 41:46.878
You know maybe if you
helped a little bit.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.505
Ah, no bitching.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.048
I saved your life, remember?

41:50.050 --> 41:52.885
Now I'm not expecting flowers
or anything like that.

41:52.887 --> 41:54.470
Just want you to do
one thing for me.

41:54.472 --> 41:55.847
Alright, is that so hard?

41:55.849 --> 41:58.682
I'm doing something real
important over here.

41:58.684 --> 41:59.518
Hmm.

42:00.394 --> 42:01.228
Mm hmm.

42:07.027 --> 42:09.485
Careful, body's
gonna fall off.

42:09.487 --> 42:11.737
Everybody here's
so fucking clumsy.

42:11.739 --> 42:12.738
This is so fucking stupid.

42:12.740 --> 42:15.032
Get the wheels up and in.

42:15.034 --> 42:18.702
Oh god, gotta get this
ax in, there, good.

42:18.704 --> 42:21.831
Alright, get over here.

42:21.833 --> 42:24.124
If there's a plan, now
would be a good time

42:24.126 --> 42:26.501
to let me in on it.

42:26.503 --> 42:27.338
Hey, Dean!

42:28.172 --> 42:29.421
I'll distract them.

42:29.423 --> 42:31.673
You switch Max into
the back of Danger One.

42:31.675 --> 42:32.509
What?

42:33.344 --> 42:34.344
By myself?

42:34.346 --> 42:35.552
Hey!

42:35.554 --> 42:36.887
How'd it go?

42:36.889 --> 42:40.099
Uh, bunch of wannabe
gangsters jumped some kid.

42:40.101 --> 42:42.101
Stabbed him in the
chest, he'll make it.

42:42.103 --> 42:43.644
Okay, you both alright?

42:43.646 --> 42:44.729
Yeah, can I talk to you?

42:44.731 --> 42:47.023
Yeah actually I wanna
talk to both of you.

42:47.025 --> 42:48.066
In my office.

42:48.068 --> 42:50.233
Got something special planned.

42:58.494 --> 43:02.081
Okay, so come on in,
come on in, here we go.

43:03.166 --> 43:05.249
♪ Here we go Reuben ♪

43:05.251 --> 43:08.838
♪ Here we go my lovely lady ♪

43:09.713 --> 43:11.838
Awesome, check this out.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.633
What's
that smell, man?

43:13.635 --> 43:17.135
I'm gonna start a new
tradition here at Turbo Elite.

43:18.931 --> 43:20.180
Dude.

43:21.726 --> 43:22.766
You know it's come to my
attention that I haven't always

43:22.768 --> 43:25.519
been like looking
out for my buds.

43:25.521 --> 43:29.648
I haven't been recognizing
the kick ass work of my EMTs.

43:29.650 --> 43:32.526
So, drum roll please.

43:35.989 --> 43:36.865
Reuben.

43:38.367 --> 43:39.201
Me?

43:40.411 --> 43:43.704
Brie has been saying
what outstanding work

43:43.706 --> 43:45.248
you've been doing out
on the field and stuff.

43:45.250 --> 43:46.124
I have?

43:46.126 --> 43:47.458
Yep.

43:47.460 --> 43:52.215
Congratulations, you are
Turbo Elite's first ever

43:52.882 --> 43:54.090
employee of the month.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.717
That name, right there.

43:56.719 --> 43:58.720
Yeah I'm gonna
show my mom this shit man!

43:58.722 --> 44:02.055
- Reuben, nice!
- What, awesomeness!

44:02.057 --> 44:04.349
Here's a frame, you
get to have a frame.

44:05.186 --> 44:06.394
Here you go.

44:06.396 --> 44:07.647
I never won
nothing before man.

44:09.106 --> 44:10.940
You didn't win it,
little man, you earned it.

44:10.942 --> 44:11.983
Thank you, man.

44:11.985 --> 44:12.900
I'm honored, man.

44:12.902 --> 44:14.693
- For real.
- Okay, okay.

44:14.695 --> 44:15.862
I mean I've
worked really hard...

44:15.864 --> 44:17.530
You don't have
to make a speech.

44:17.532 --> 44:18.655
Alright?

44:18.657 --> 44:19.491
Okay.

44:20.492 --> 44:22.036
So why isn't Eric here?

44:23.288 --> 44:25.121
Oh, it would be awkward.

44:25.123 --> 44:27.914
He, yeah, he really
wanted to win.

44:27.916 --> 44:30.584
You guys need anything?

44:30.586 --> 44:32.297
Mouth, no, good, bye.

44:34.382 --> 44:36.048
Boss, could
you get some beef jerky?

44:36.050 --> 44:38.383
Whatever
you want, diva!

44:39.471 --> 44:41.139
Eric, get in the car.

44:42.306 --> 44:43.889
Wait.

44:43.891 --> 44:46.393
Dean tell me before I'm
not, like, a good employee.

44:48.521 --> 44:50.479
That shit was weird, right?

45:21.346 --> 45:23.595
Get in here, JJ.

45:23.597 --> 45:24.682
Don't be shy.

45:32.815 --> 45:34.106
So, you look like shit.

45:34.108 --> 45:36.900
Yeah well it's
been a shitty day.

45:36.902 --> 45:39.488
Well I am sorry
to hear that, truly.

45:49.833 --> 45:52.251
I see you made some calls.

45:53.253 --> 45:54.086
Oi.

46:10.644 --> 46:13.021
There's no easy way to say this

46:13.023 --> 46:14.524
but I'm pulling you off the job.

46:17.318 --> 46:18.194
Ah, well.

46:19.195 --> 46:21.070
That would be a mistake.

46:21.072 --> 46:24.574
You said it was merely
a matter of retrieval.

46:24.576 --> 46:26.742
That's exactly what
these two specialize in.

46:26.744 --> 46:29.077
But it's my
operation, I set it up,

46:29.079 --> 46:33.081
and we've had three deliveries
this week no problem.

46:33.083 --> 46:33.917
Until tonight,

46:35.045 --> 46:36.961
when there was a pretty
big fucking problem.

46:36.963 --> 46:38.963
Yeah but I can fix it.

46:38.965 --> 46:40.050
I've made up my mind.

46:41.634 --> 46:43.300
Point those two in
the right direction,

46:43.302 --> 46:45.387
they'll get it wrapped
up, but you're out.

46:56.733 --> 46:58.358
It's your new project.

46:58.360 --> 46:59.193
Yes it is.

47:00.362 --> 47:01.695
Nice, very nice.

47:03.030 --> 47:07.659
Maybe I could help you with
it once construction begins.

47:10.079 --> 47:10.913
And do what?

47:11.914 --> 47:14.999
Rough up the union bosses?

47:15.001 --> 47:17.959
Now come on, it's
not the old days, JJ.

47:17.961 --> 47:20.295
Now I simply bribe people.

47:20.297 --> 47:22.049
That's partly what
the cash was for.

47:24.677 --> 47:26.804
Besides, look at you.

47:28.056 --> 47:32.936
You'll have a chance to spend
more time with your music.

47:34.144 --> 47:36.605
That little opera thing
you've been composing.

47:37.856 --> 47:40.483
That's what you wanted, right?

47:40.485 --> 47:41.820
Yeah, it was.

47:42.987 --> 47:47.867
But, uh, I can't do that
without your generosity, Silas.

47:53.331 --> 48:00.461
So I need this job.

48:00.463 --> 48:02.215
It's not all your fault.

48:04.009 --> 48:07.804
Maybe you're just not up to
this tough guy shit anymore.

48:10.181 --> 48:11.016
You got old, right?

48:17.188 --> 48:18.021
What did you say?

48:18.023 --> 48:20.023
Old.

48:20.025 --> 48:21.067
You got old, JJ.

48:24.070 --> 48:26.653
So, how about you
finish your drink,

48:26.655 --> 48:30.074
take your Men's Warehouse
suit and that absurd hairpiece

48:30.076 --> 48:31.286
and go home, hmm?

48:54.851 --> 48:59.019
Oh shit!

48:59.021 --> 48:59.855
JJ, stop!

49:09.740 --> 49:12.240
Did you see that, Silas?

49:12.242 --> 49:15.161
Not bad for an old fart, eh?

49:15.163 --> 49:18.039
Oh god, oh I've
changed my mind.

49:18.041 --> 49:20.208
You can stay on, finish the job,

49:20.210 --> 49:21.208
just get me to a hospital.

49:21.210 --> 49:25.088
Oh, that's okay,
you know what?

49:25.090 --> 49:27.173
I figure I'm self-employed now.

49:27.175 --> 49:28.215
Oh!

49:28.217 --> 49:29.258
No wait wait!

49:29.260 --> 49:30.095
What do you want?

49:32.179 --> 49:34.137
Code to your safe.

49:34.139 --> 49:36.099
- It's not here.
- Oh well.

49:37.559 --> 49:41.061
Oh one six one six five four.

49:42.273 --> 49:45.441
- Oh six five four.
- Five four!

49:45.443 --> 49:46.277
I got it.

49:54.452 --> 49:57.286
Hello, my lovelies.

49:57.288 --> 49:59.289
Where have you
been all my life?

50:03.293 --> 50:04.128
Okay.

50:05.130 --> 50:06.840
One more mil to go.

50:24.273 --> 50:26.025
I take it you never
dumped a body before, right?

50:27.318 --> 50:30.653
No Dean, no, I have not.

50:30.655 --> 50:31.489
Right.

50:32.907 --> 50:36.950
Well, hit me with any ideas.

50:36.952 --> 50:40.287
And you're an accomplice
now so turning ourselves in,

50:40.289 --> 50:41.831
that ain't one of 'em.

50:41.833 --> 50:43.293
You're the one that fucking
got us into this mess.

50:44.585 --> 50:46.918
I'm just trying not
to get caught here.

50:48.213 --> 50:49.757
Oh you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

50:51.384 --> 50:53.133
We must've rolled a
stop sign or something.

50:53.135 --> 50:54.177
I didn't roll any
fucking stop signs, Dean.

50:54.179 --> 50:55.387
The fuck am I gonna do now?

50:56.389 --> 50:57.387
Pull over, dude.

50:57.389 --> 50:58.599
Okay, I'm pulling over.

51:00.226 --> 51:01.059
You seem nervous.

51:01.061 --> 51:02.019
Don't be nervous.

51:03.103 --> 51:05.188
There's a bond
between cops and EMTs.

51:05.190 --> 51:07.067
They'll just give
us a warning, watch.

51:12.780 --> 51:14.157
Stop eating that crap!

51:15.574 --> 51:18.200
- I'm such a nervous eater.
- Shit, he's coming!

51:18.202 --> 51:20.036
Okay, look at
me, it's all good.

51:20.038 --> 51:22.121
It's all good.

51:22.123 --> 51:23.331
Deep breath in.

51:24.376 --> 51:25.208
Slow out.

51:25.210 --> 51:26.043
Just like that.

51:31.173 --> 51:32.340
Evening, boys.

51:32.342 --> 51:33.340
- Evening.
- Evening.

51:33.342 --> 51:35.385
Captain Beckwith,
immigration and customs.

51:35.387 --> 51:37.512
You know I just missed
you back at the garage

51:37.514 --> 51:38.845
so I thought I'd grab you here

51:38.847 --> 51:40.722
as opposed to waiting
for you to come back.

51:40.724 --> 51:41.557
Little bit of a hurry.

51:41.559 --> 51:42.849
Okay.

51:42.851 --> 51:44.559
Oh, we know that feeling.

51:44.561 --> 51:48.231
Oh shit, I'm not interrupting
a run or anything, am I?

51:48.233 --> 51:50.273
- No.
- Please, we're fine.

51:50.275 --> 51:54.487
And you were both
on the call tonight?

51:54.489 --> 51:57.322
You know, the crash
off San Pedro?

51:57.324 --> 51:58.157
- Yep.
- Yep.

51:58.159 --> 51:58.990
Yep.

51:58.992 --> 51:59.994
Hmm, sorry.

52:01.496 --> 52:03.664
It must be hard to lose
somebody like that.

52:05.791 --> 52:06.835
It's part of the job.

52:09.461 --> 52:11.628
Mind if I take a
look in the back?

52:11.630 --> 52:13.005
Why?

52:13.007 --> 52:14.007
I mean, we're...

52:15.300 --> 52:16.258
We probably don't
want you to do that.

52:16.260 --> 52:18.010
I mean we would prefer you to...

52:18.012 --> 52:23.891
Well, the guy you picked
up was carrying contraband.

52:23.893 --> 52:25.936
It wasn't on him when he
arrived at the hospital.

52:28.231 --> 52:30.356
Maybe it was the wrong guy.

52:30.358 --> 52:31.192
No.

52:32.443 --> 52:34.235
No, we know he was part
of a ring smuggling money

52:34.237 --> 52:35.862
from overseas bank accounts.

52:35.864 --> 52:37.447
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

52:37.449 --> 52:40.324
You know, mostly old
people trying to avoid taxes.

52:40.326 --> 52:41.700
Old people are doing that?

52:41.702 --> 52:43.202
Hey maybe it fell
out in the back.

52:43.204 --> 52:45.746
We woulda noticed
something like that, right?

52:45.748 --> 52:47.414
Right.

52:47.416 --> 52:49.541
'Cause we're pretty, you
know, pretty on top of it.

52:49.543 --> 52:52.003
It's pretty clean back
there, spick and span.

52:52.005 --> 52:54.007
Yeah well all the same.

52:55.215 --> 52:57.258
I'm just checking
things off my list so

52:57.260 --> 52:58.383
mind if I take a
look in the back?

53:00.096 --> 53:02.389
I mean you probably need
like, um, probable cause.

53:04.391 --> 53:05.393
Probably.

53:06.393 --> 53:09.479
The suspect rode
in here with you.

53:09.481 --> 53:11.271
That's my probable cause.

53:11.273 --> 53:12.273
Oh.

53:12.275 --> 53:13.648
- Huh.
- Oh okay.

53:13.650 --> 53:14.485
Open it.

53:16.780 --> 53:18.070
You know what?

53:18.072 --> 53:29.414
Why don't you go ahead
and open it for him?

53:29.416 --> 53:30.666
Something
happen to your arm there?

53:30.668 --> 53:33.586
Um, I got a tattoo.

53:33.588 --> 53:34.878
Tonight?

53:34.880 --> 53:37.382
No, no it
was on Saturday.

53:37.384 --> 53:38.675
Oh, okay.

53:38.677 --> 53:39.592
Does that still hurt?

53:39.594 --> 53:40.929
No, no, it's fine.

54:29.059 --> 54:30.684
What the hell?

54:33.981 --> 54:35.898
I'm sorry!

54:35.900 --> 54:36.735
I'm sorry!

54:43.365 --> 54:45.992
Oh my god.

54:45.994 --> 54:46.827
Oh!

54:50.373 --> 54:51.958
No put the gun down!

54:53.835 --> 54:54.668
Oh fuck!

54:56.838 --> 54:57.836
Dean, Dean!

55:18.068 --> 55:20.108
There's a car
coming, we gotta go.

55:20.110 --> 55:21.862
Eric, come on man!

55:22.739 --> 55:23.572
You drive.

55:27.284 --> 55:28.409
What the fuck was that?

55:28.411 --> 55:29.702
- You've lost it, man!
- Come on!

55:29.704 --> 55:30.994
I did what I had to do.

55:30.996 --> 55:32.204
That was
different than Max.

55:32.206 --> 55:33.039
- No.
- Whoa whoa whoa, hold on.

55:33.041 --> 55:33.873
Max was self-defense.

55:33.875 --> 55:34.706
You killed this fucking guy!

55:34.708 --> 55:35.916
Yeah, I know.

55:35.918 --> 55:36.833
- That was murder!
- But he was gonna kill us.

55:36.835 --> 55:38.086
- Hey.
- How do you know that?

55:38.088 --> 55:39.420
Because he was
fucking shady, dude.

55:39.422 --> 55:41.421
If he saw the money he was gonna
fucking blow us away, okay?

55:41.423 --> 55:43.883
Hold on, just fucking ask
yourself what you woulda done.

55:43.885 --> 55:44.717
Not that!

55:44.719 --> 55:46.179
Just, fuck, not that!

55:47.554 --> 55:48.970
He coulda let us go, man.

55:48.972 --> 55:53.061
Why the fuck did he have
to look inside the back?

55:53.978 --> 55:55.436
Hey man, where you taking us?

55:55.438 --> 55:57.229
Back to the garage.

55:57.231 --> 55:58.858
Aren't you
forgetting something?

56:06.199 --> 56:07.532
Fuck!

56:07.534 --> 56:08.950
He said he wanted
to get out of town.

56:08.952 --> 56:10.450
Miles of pumps and pipes,

56:10.452 --> 56:12.579
it's like a giant
garbage disposal.

56:18.628 --> 56:19.546
Let's do this.

56:20.755 --> 56:22.215
I have an idea.

56:24.134 --> 56:27.300
We're gonna tilt this right
up, it's gonna go right in.

56:27.302 --> 56:28.137
Easy.

56:29.972 --> 56:33.016
He'll be fish food before
anybody finds anything.

56:33.018 --> 56:35.561
Now lift with your legs, go
go go, go go go go go go.

56:38.356 --> 56:39.688
What now?

56:39.690 --> 56:40.773
You do this strap,
I'll do this one.

56:40.775 --> 56:41.608
On three.

56:44.112 --> 56:45.653
One, two, three.

56:53.746 --> 56:54.580
Jesus Christ.

56:56.498 --> 56:57.498
Alright.

57:05.050 --> 57:07.258
Give me a hand, Eric.

57:07.260 --> 57:09.594
- Pull it!
- I'm fucking pulling!

57:09.596 --> 57:14.389
Come on, you bitch, you little
bitch, you fucking pussy.

57:14.391 --> 57:16.516
Holy shit man, you
can't, holy shit!

57:19.856 --> 57:20.690
Alright.

57:21.733 --> 57:23.733
Dean, where are you going?

57:23.735 --> 57:26.943
This is a stupid fucking idea.

57:26.945 --> 57:29.530
You're gonna love this one.

57:29.532 --> 57:31.699
What do you
think you're doing?

57:31.701 --> 57:33.534
What are you gonna do with that?

57:33.536 --> 57:36.496
Dean, fucking listen to me.

57:36.498 --> 57:38.498
What are you doing?

57:38.500 --> 57:39.626
We're gonna make it fit.

57:50.135 --> 57:50.969
Sorry Max.

58:28.632 --> 58:29.466
Eric.

58:37.349 --> 58:38.682
Come on.

58:38.684 --> 58:39.853
Come help me with
this thing, okay?

58:41.438 --> 58:42.271
Dean.

58:47.527 --> 58:48.360
Oh.

58:58.079 --> 58:58.913
Come on.

59:00.498 --> 59:02.914
Give me a hand with this.

59:02.916 --> 59:04.583
- It's heavy.
- Yeah.

59:04.585 --> 59:08.880
Watch your fingers.

59:14.762 --> 59:15.677
It's okay.

59:15.679 --> 59:17.556
It's alright, just, you know.

59:18.641 --> 59:20.182
That's why you got 10 of 'em.

59:23.813 --> 59:24.686
Here.

59:24.688 --> 59:25.522
Look.

59:26.858 --> 59:28.441
Take some of these.

59:28.443 --> 59:29.441
What is that?

59:29.443 --> 59:30.735
It's Percocet.

59:30.737 --> 59:32.903
No, it's Oxy, even better.

59:32.905 --> 59:34.155
Just take a bunch of these,

59:34.157 --> 59:35.530
you'll forget you even
have fingers, bro.

59:39.286 --> 59:40.202
You know what's worse
than leaving fingerprints

59:40.204 --> 59:41.581
at the scene of a crime, right?

59:43.123 --> 59:44.456
Leaving your finger!

59:46.210 --> 59:47.878
Come on, that's gold!

59:55.177 --> 59:59.889
- How 'bout this after party?
- Yeah, we can do that.

59:59.891 --> 01:00:02.266
Oh shit, is that a dead body?

01:00:02.268 --> 01:00:03.684
Oh my god.

01:00:03.686 --> 01:00:05.311
Call 9111.

01:00:05.313 --> 01:00:07.813
- Gross.
- Let's call from the car.

01:00:07.815 --> 01:00:09.606
We only have an
hour left anyway.

01:00:12.528 --> 01:00:13.905
Oh, good, she looks
pissed about something.

01:00:16.699 --> 01:00:17.949
Oh man, she's on one tonight.

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:20.867
Let me do the talking, alright?

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:26.458
Hmm.

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:30.838
Where's Reuben?

01:00:32.257 --> 01:00:33.090
Well.

01:00:34.509 --> 01:00:36.717
Bravo's out of commission
so I sent him home.

01:00:36.719 --> 01:00:39.096
Well what did I get
all this beef jerky for?

01:00:43.559 --> 01:00:45.142
What happened to your finger?

01:00:45.144 --> 01:00:45.978
Nothing.

01:00:46.771 --> 01:00:48.729
Just slammed it in the door.

01:00:48.731 --> 01:00:52.816
Yep, ouch.

01:00:52.818 --> 01:00:57.905
What?

01:00:57.907 --> 01:00:59.409
I gotta talk to
you for a second.

01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:05.746
Dean!

01:01:05.748 --> 01:01:07.789
Hold on Speedy
Gonzales, slow down.

01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.295
Is this about New Year's Eve?

01:01:13.297 --> 01:01:15.424
Hey so we can trust
each other, right?

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.092
Of course.

01:01:18.094 --> 01:01:18.927
Huh.

01:01:21.222 --> 01:01:22.429
When I was out on this last call

01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:23.264
this kid was bleeding
all over, right?

01:01:23.266 --> 01:01:24.599
So, um...

01:01:24.601 --> 01:01:26.266
Now where'd you put that?

01:01:26.268 --> 01:01:27.102
Ah, here it is.

01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:31.146
So I was looking for
some quick lock dressing.

01:01:31.148 --> 01:01:33.398
So I checked Danger One's
bench compartment and,

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.985
funny thing, there
was a padlock on it.

01:01:35.987 --> 01:01:36.820
Hmm.

01:01:59.927 --> 01:02:01.596
Then I find these on the floor.

01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:05.722
Hmm, odd.

01:02:05.724 --> 01:02:07.393
What the fuck
is going on, Dean?

01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:11.146
You
have one new message.

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.356
Eric, it's me.

01:02:14.358 --> 01:02:16.025
I couldn't fall asleep.

01:02:16.027 --> 01:02:18.068
I know you're probably
driving, or...

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:19.362
You don't have to call back.

01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:21.199
I was just hoping
that I'd catch you.

01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:24.825
I don't like how
we left it today.

01:02:24.827 --> 01:02:29.789
So if you can call,
I'll probably be up.

01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:30.956
I love you.

01:02:32.335 --> 01:02:33.251
All units,
hit and run, officer down.

01:02:33.253 --> 01:02:35.336
All units, repeat, officer down.

01:02:35.338 --> 01:02:38.880
1400 block of Newton,
cross street Hooper...

01:02:38.882 --> 01:02:39.965
- Fuck me.
- Code three, code three.

01:02:39.967 --> 01:02:42.844
All units, hit and
run, officer down.

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.845
All units, repeat, officer down.

01:02:44.847 --> 01:02:45.929
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, mm hmm.

01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:46.930
That location.

01:02:46.932 --> 01:02:48.932
We're gonna take it.

01:02:48.934 --> 01:02:50.226
We're gonna take it?

01:02:50.228 --> 01:02:51.061
Yeah, what if
he pulls through?

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.856
That would be bad.

01:02:54.356 --> 01:02:56.106
I'm going with you guys.

01:02:56.108 --> 01:02:57.235
Oh no no no no no.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.195
- It's okay bro.
- It's not okay bro.

01:03:01.197 --> 01:03:03.990
- Look, she knows.
- What?

01:03:03.992 --> 01:03:06.577
Yeah, he told me everything.

01:03:07.911 --> 01:03:12.081
- Everything?
- Everything, everything.

01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:13.793
Eric, come on, get in.

01:03:25.304 --> 01:03:26.762
Yeah we're gonna
take a left up here.

01:03:26.764 --> 01:03:28.055
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah, here.

01:03:28.057 --> 01:03:28.932
At the light.

01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:23.403
He still breathing?

01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:24.778
Barely.

01:04:28.076 --> 01:04:29.200
He'll have a chance
if we get him to an ER

01:04:29.202 --> 01:04:35.331
in the next five minutes.

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:36.166
Slow code.

01:04:46.885 --> 01:04:48.262
Eric, let's make
it six minutes.

01:05:05.905 --> 01:05:07.405
Eric.

01:05:07.407 --> 01:05:11.745
Just to be clear, I'm saying
drive a little slower.

01:05:19.085 --> 01:05:21.878
Eric, we can't risk
him pulling through

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.340
and identifying us.

01:05:26.134 --> 01:05:28.887
Eric, do you hear
what I'm saying?

01:05:33.932 --> 01:05:36.099
Please slow down.

01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:37.019
Right, Eric.

01:05:44.068 --> 01:05:46.193
Shit.

01:05:46.195 --> 01:05:49.280
- Slow down, Eric!
- Eric, slow the fuck down!

01:05:49.282 --> 01:05:50.115
Eric!

01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:57.579
We're restraining this
guy, just pull the fuck over!

01:05:57.581 --> 01:06:01.083
Oh fuck!

01:06:01.085 --> 01:06:04.128
Son of a bitch, where'd
you get the fucking knife?

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.253
Drop the knife!

01:06:05.255 --> 01:06:07.007
- Let go!
- It fucking hurts!

01:06:08.175 --> 01:06:09.009
Gah!

01:06:17.434 --> 01:06:18.268
That's it.

01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:20.436
That's it.

01:06:22.481 --> 01:06:23.900
Fuck, I'm sorry.

01:06:27.445 --> 01:06:28.278
Fuck.

01:07:12.322 --> 01:07:13.990
Unit nine, status?

01:07:13.992 --> 01:07:17.037
Repeat, unit nine,
what is your status?

01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:23.918
10-40, patient is deceased.

01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:53.487
10-4, unit nine.

01:07:53.489 --> 01:07:55.282
Mind
if I take a look in the back?

01:08:00.996 --> 01:08:05.041
You chop me up and then
you throw me in the sewer.

01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:06.626
Man, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:08.505
I was just blowing
off a little steam.

01:08:10.172 --> 01:08:11.215
But Dean.

01:08:13.217 --> 01:08:15.010
I'd watch out for
that sneaky fucker.

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:17.514
Keep an eye on
him if I were you.

01:08:21.393 --> 01:08:22.769
Do you smell beef jerky?

01:08:35.698 --> 01:08:36.532
Hey.

01:08:37.867 --> 01:08:38.702
It's amazing.

01:08:40.036 --> 01:08:40.868
Thank you.

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:48.334
Thank you, Eric.

01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:50.377
Don't do that, don't thank me.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.256
I didn't want you
involved in any of this.

01:08:58.386 --> 01:08:59.636
You know what?

01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:01.765
Don't lecture me on
what's dangerous, okay?

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.100
'Cause I can handle myself.

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:07.144
- Brie.
- What?

01:09:07.145 --> 01:09:08.312
You don't know what
I've been through,

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:09.354
you don't know what I've done.

01:09:09.356 --> 01:09:11.189
Fuck, you don't know me at all.

01:09:11.192 --> 01:09:16.153
Yeah, no shit.

01:09:16.154 --> 01:09:20.866
I had to start my life
over again and again.

01:09:20.868 --> 01:09:23.618
In and out of juvie,
beat up, shot at,

01:09:23.621 --> 01:09:26.371
I shouldn't be fucking
alive but you know what?

01:09:26.372 --> 01:09:29.666
This is my opportunity to
have the life I deserve.

01:09:29.667 --> 01:09:32.294
Okay so yeah I know
it's dangerous.

01:09:32.296 --> 01:09:35.298
I don't care, I
don't give a fuck!

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.465
It's all worth it.

01:09:36.466 --> 01:09:41.345
Really, all this?

01:09:41.346 --> 01:09:42.180
Mm hmm.

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.642
Hey, it's over, okay?

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:47.019
It's over.

01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:54.610
Hmm?

01:09:56.195 --> 01:09:57.611
What you gonna do?

01:10:03.078 --> 01:10:04.076
Huh, watch yourself.

01:10:04.078 --> 01:10:05.620
Great, great, let's go.

01:10:05.622 --> 01:10:06.620
Ow!

01:10:06.622 --> 01:10:08.040
- Oh oh oh!
- Stop!

01:10:14.506 --> 01:10:16.964
I'm so fucking
turned on right now.

01:10:16.966 --> 01:10:18.508
Well I just got
stabbed in the leg,

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:20.218
it kinda fucking hurts.

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.302
Does this hurt?

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:23.095
I just want you to
fuck me right now.

01:10:23.097 --> 01:10:23.931
Okay.

01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:39.322
Yeah, yeah, uh huh.

01:10:41.573 --> 01:10:44.076
Focus, focus, there, come on.

01:10:46.162 --> 01:10:48.498
Down, down, down motherfucker!

01:10:53.712 --> 01:10:56.504
You remember what I like, huh?

01:10:56.506 --> 01:10:57.338
What?

01:10:58.173 --> 01:10:59.007
That, this.

01:10:59.009 --> 01:10:59.840
This.

01:10:59.842 --> 01:11:15.147
What the fuck are you doing?

01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:16.648
Wait, don't you smell that?

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.942
I don't smell shit.

01:11:18.944 --> 01:11:20.527
No no no.

01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:23.990
- Oh my god, no no no!
- What?

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:25.324
What, what is it?

01:11:25.326 --> 01:11:26.534
Dean!

01:11:26.536 --> 01:11:32.456
Do I have to do
everything by myself?

01:11:32.458 --> 01:11:36.294
No no no no no no no why
why why why why why why?

01:11:43.219 --> 01:11:44.468
Oh shit!

01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:46.595
Fuck!

01:11:46.597 --> 01:11:48.055
Eric!

01:11:48.057 --> 01:11:49.559
What the fuck, man?

01:11:51.269 --> 01:11:52.103
Shit!

01:11:57.609 --> 01:12:03.696
Eric, stop!

01:12:13.082 --> 01:12:16.918
Again, I'm so sorry
for your loss and listen

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.711
if there's anything you need
just give me a call, okay?

01:12:19.713 --> 01:12:21.091
Bye, take care, sorry.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.766
That was his daughter.

01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:34.018
Yeah.

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.896
How'd she take it?

01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:37.190
Like you'd expect.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.773
She's got some family
in town at least, so.

01:12:39.775 --> 01:12:41.067
Guy see anything?

01:12:41.069 --> 01:12:42.485
Yeah.

01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:44.486
They said they checked some of
the nearby shops in the area.

01:12:44.488 --> 01:12:46.697
See if they got some
kind of CCTV footage

01:12:46.699 --> 01:12:47.701
of the traffic stop.

01:12:49.118 --> 01:12:50.036
No one saw nothing.

01:12:51.621 --> 01:12:53.204
Look man.

01:12:53.206 --> 01:12:55.540
This shit is getting
too fucked up right now.

01:12:55.542 --> 01:12:57.544
Okay we just gotta
call it quits and...

01:12:58.586 --> 01:12:59.626
What?

01:12:59.628 --> 01:13:01.004
No.

01:13:01.006 --> 01:13:03.505
It had to be that ambulance
guy he was checking on.

01:13:03.507 --> 01:13:05.133
It happened half a
mile from their garage.

01:13:05.135 --> 01:13:08.012
Come on, there's no way we
can know that for sure, okay?

01:13:11.056 --> 01:13:12.725
There's only one
way to find out.

01:13:15.185 --> 01:13:16.102
No fucking way, okay?

01:13:16.104 --> 01:13:18.064
I am done with this shit.

01:13:23.528 --> 01:13:25.695
It was your idea
to start with.

01:13:25.697 --> 01:13:27.030
Now I don't know about you,

01:13:27.032 --> 01:13:28.990
but I didn't sign up
to deport old ladies

01:13:28.992 --> 01:13:30.991
back to El Salvador or
whatever the fuck it is

01:13:30.993 --> 01:13:33.076
we do half the time.

01:13:33.078 --> 01:13:34.161
This is our ticket out.

01:13:34.163 --> 01:13:35.955
Walk away if you want.

01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:37.959
But then Beck died for nothing.

01:13:39.627 --> 01:13:40.625
And if it makes you feel better

01:13:40.627 --> 01:13:42.503
we can give his cut
to his daughter.

01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:43.547
Make sure she's good.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:46.634
Your call.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.893
I saved most of it.

01:13:57.145 --> 01:13:59.064
I thought
he was coming around.

01:14:00.273 --> 01:14:02.482
But maybe he's not
cut out for this.

01:14:02.484 --> 01:14:03.318
You know?

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:06.363
Maybe we do have to
trust each other.

01:14:09.573 --> 01:14:11.866
So.

01:14:11.868 --> 01:14:12.702
So?

01:14:40.939 --> 01:14:43.690
Say something, Dean.

01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:45.359
He's my best friend.

01:14:48.154 --> 01:14:50.907
Okay, but we're
running out of time.

01:15:02.167 --> 01:15:03.002
Fuck.

01:15:29.654 --> 01:15:30.864
So, what's next?

01:15:32.364 --> 01:15:34.824
Uh for now let's, you know,
just get him out of sight

01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:37.412
and yeah we should be good.

01:15:52.886 --> 01:15:53.720
Stop.

01:15:56.264 --> 01:16:00.185
My bad, I was just,
you know, I get hyped up.

01:16:01.519 --> 01:16:05.562
You sure about this shit?

01:16:05.564 --> 01:16:07.522
Only thing standing
between us and that money

01:16:07.524 --> 01:16:09.443
is a couple paramedics.

01:16:12.822 --> 01:16:13.655
I'm sure.

01:16:31.341 --> 01:16:40.723
Brie, stop it!

01:16:40.725 --> 01:16:41.893
Calm down, Brie.

01:16:45.313 --> 01:16:48.024
That's fucked up man,
that's really fucked up.

01:16:49.192 --> 01:16:50.607
You been playing
me this whole time?

01:16:50.609 --> 01:16:51.817
Huh?

01:16:51.819 --> 01:16:52.862
Then what?

01:16:53.863 --> 01:16:55.987
Then where the fuck
were you gonna go?

01:16:55.989 --> 01:16:57.324
Uh, guys?

01:16:59.868 --> 01:17:01.827
Oh shit.

01:17:01.829 --> 01:17:03.370
What's going on?

01:17:03.372 --> 01:17:05.373
I don't know Reuben,
why don't you tell me?

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:06.915
Just got a text.

01:17:06.917 --> 01:17:09.753
Brie, she needed me
to come pick her up.

01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:14.132
I bet she did.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.222
So, uh, Brie, um, you still
coming home with me or not?

01:17:21.807 --> 01:17:22.807
- Yes.
- No.

01:17:22.809 --> 01:17:23.849
- Yes.
- No.

01:17:23.851 --> 01:17:24.767
I got candles
burning right now.

01:17:24.769 --> 01:17:25.809
Blow 'em out yourself, okay?

01:17:25.811 --> 01:17:26.643
- Reuben, stay.
- No.

01:17:26.645 --> 01:17:27.562
- Yeah.
- I'm in charge.

01:17:27.564 --> 01:17:28.396
- Reuben, go!
- Guys.

01:17:28.398 --> 01:17:29.938
Reuben, stay!

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:30.983
Hello, hi.

01:17:32.277 --> 01:17:37.282
Is there a supervisor on duty?

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:40.407
Yeah, that's me,
hi, I run the place.

01:17:40.409 --> 01:17:43.035
What, who are you?

01:17:43.037 --> 01:17:47.791
I am an investigator
from Rigoletto Insurance.

01:17:51.212 --> 01:17:52.505
I let myself in.

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:54.423
Obviously.

01:17:55.841 --> 01:18:00.846
I was hoping I could,
um, grab a quick statement

01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:06.099
concerning the fatal accident

01:18:06.101 --> 01:18:10.562
that occurred
earlier this evening.

01:18:10.564 --> 01:18:11.938
Dude.

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.275
It's four in the fucking AM.

01:18:14.277 --> 01:18:15.777
It's a little late for
this, don't you think?

01:18:15.779 --> 01:18:18.362
Oh, uh, heavens.

01:18:18.364 --> 01:18:20.822
Honestly, I thought
I was too early.

01:18:20.824 --> 01:18:22.657
It's fucking both.

01:18:22.659 --> 01:18:24.410
It's an especially shitty time

01:18:24.412 --> 01:18:25.789
for you to barge in like this.

01:18:27.289 --> 01:18:30.791
Couldn't you hit us back
during normal business hours?

01:18:30.793 --> 01:18:34.211
Sorry, I don't understand
a word you're saying.

01:18:34.213 --> 01:18:36.173
Could you handle
this over the phone?

01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:40.804
Darling, this will
only take a few minutes.

01:18:42.805 --> 01:18:46.808
I just wanted to confirm
that you were the company

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:55.857
that transported the victim.

01:18:55.859 --> 01:18:57.235
Police!

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:58.402
- Hands in the fucking air!
- Hands up!

01:18:58.404 --> 01:18:59.861
Now!

01:18:59.863 --> 01:19:02.115
- Put 'em straight the fuck up!
- Just keep 'em up.

01:19:02.117 --> 01:19:03.657
Damnit Reuben,
would it kill you

01:19:03.659 --> 01:19:04.786
to lock the fucking door?

01:19:07.956 --> 01:19:09.371
Fuck, why'd you do that?

01:19:09.373 --> 01:19:12.040
Ooh!

01:19:12.042 --> 01:19:15.169
And I'm gonna keep going
until one of you tells me

01:19:15.171 --> 01:19:16.006
where it is.

01:19:17.966 --> 01:19:20.424
Sorry, we don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

01:19:23.512 --> 01:19:24.346
Really?

01:19:25.515 --> 01:19:27.807
Where is it?

01:19:27.809 --> 01:19:30.018
Where is the money?

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.352
Where is the money?

01:19:31.354 --> 01:19:32.896
I can't tell you if you've
got that gun in my face.

01:19:34.858 --> 01:19:37.525
Stop.

01:19:37.527 --> 01:19:38.778
I know where it is.

01:19:44.074 --> 01:19:45.409
Don't listen to her.

01:19:47.662 --> 01:19:48.663
You can't trust her.

01:19:54.252 --> 01:19:55.460
I'll take you to it.

01:19:55.462 --> 01:19:56.671
Brie, don't.

01:20:07.931 --> 01:20:10.599
- No, Reuben!
- Reuben!

01:20:10.601 --> 01:20:13.102
- Drop it.
- Fuck me.

01:20:13.104 --> 01:20:14.062
Shit.

01:20:14.064 --> 01:20:16.438
- I'm sorry.
- Oh my god.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.026
Drop your weapon.

01:20:23.739 --> 01:20:26.199
You know, you and your
friend might wanna consider

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:27.657
just leaving the way you came.

01:20:27.659 --> 01:20:28.992
This doesn't concern you.

01:20:28.994 --> 01:20:30.745
Do you know who
you're dealing with right now?

01:20:30.747 --> 01:20:32.164
Uh, do you?

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:37.876
Take your mask off please.

01:20:37.878 --> 01:20:39.211
Drop your fucking gun.

01:20:39.213 --> 01:20:40.631
Can he take his mask off?

01:20:43.259 --> 01:20:44.094
Last chance.

01:20:44.969 --> 01:20:46.596
Leave or die.

01:20:47.721 --> 01:20:48.847
Fuck you, old man.

01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:56.353
No!

01:21:02.612 --> 01:21:06.074
Take him down!

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:14.248
Reuben.

01:21:20.546 --> 01:21:23.798
What the fuck are
we gonna do, huh?

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.301
Fuck you traitor!

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.973
Fuckin' A!

01:21:32.975 --> 01:21:37.188
Fucking Reuben's dead because
of you, you fucking idiot!

01:21:42.068 --> 01:21:42.944
Dean, Dean!

01:21:44.069 --> 01:21:45.736
Gimme the gun,
gimme the fucking gun.

01:21:45.738 --> 01:21:47.071
Get in, let's go!

01:21:47.073 --> 01:21:49.240
Go, I got you fuck,
I got you, I got you!

01:21:53.203 --> 01:21:54.038
Fuck, shit!

01:21:56.498 --> 01:21:58.206
Come on,
come on, come on!

01:21:58.208 --> 01:21:59.500
Hurry up, come on!

01:22:01.921 --> 01:22:05.923
- Hurry up, Brie!
- Fucking die bitch, die!

01:22:05.925 --> 01:22:08.134
I'm not fucking
around, let's go.

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.093
Get down, get down!

01:22:10.095 --> 01:22:12.429
Go, Eric, fucking go!

01:22:12.431 --> 01:22:14.389
Start driving Eric!

01:22:29.698 --> 01:22:30.908
Oh fuck, fuck!

01:22:56.975 --> 01:22:58.560
Reuben
didn't deserve that.

01:23:00.063 --> 01:23:01.353
Who the hell were those guys?

01:23:01.355 --> 01:23:03.065
You know the guy
that we ran over?

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.110
I think they were his buddies.

01:23:07.112 --> 01:23:08.777
What about
the other guy?

01:23:08.779 --> 01:23:10.612
I think he sells insurance.

01:23:10.614 --> 01:23:19.414
Pretty sure he doesn't.

01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:20.250
Hey.

01:23:22.543 --> 01:23:23.377
Thank you.

01:23:24.546 --> 01:23:28.964
For not leaving us back there.

01:23:28.966 --> 01:23:30.465
Where
are we even going?

01:23:30.467 --> 01:23:32.134
Well.

01:23:32.136 --> 01:23:33.343
Mulholland.

01:23:33.345 --> 01:23:35.595
My uncle has a house
there in the hills.

01:23:35.597 --> 01:23:38.849
We can hide out there for a
while, figure this shit out.

01:23:38.851 --> 01:23:41.268
Fine, we should all go.

01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:43.230
I'll just get us up there first.

01:24:57.764 --> 01:24:58.888
What is it, what's going on?

01:24:58.890 --> 01:25:10.148
Someone's following us.

01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:12.860
That guy from the
garage, the insurance guy,

01:25:12.862 --> 01:25:13.861
you think it's him?

01:25:13.863 --> 01:25:14.986
Go!

01:25:16.658 --> 01:25:17.656
Shit!

01:25:17.658 --> 01:25:19.366
Oh fuck!

01:25:19.368 --> 01:25:20.826
Go faster!

01:25:20.828 --> 01:25:24.205
- Yeah, it's him.
- You think?

01:25:28.795 --> 01:25:31.129
Eric, do something!

01:25:31.131 --> 01:25:31.965
Oh my god!

01:25:33.966 --> 01:25:36.885
Eric we're sitting
ducks back here!

01:25:38.846 --> 01:25:41.513
Swerve a little!

01:26:14.131 --> 01:26:14.965
Dean.

01:26:17.385 --> 01:26:19.343
You guys alright?

01:26:19.345 --> 01:26:20.803
Brie?

01:26:20.805 --> 01:26:23.682
My keys,
she took my keys.

01:26:29.355 --> 01:26:30.354
Eric.

01:26:30.356 --> 01:26:32.274
We gotta get outta
here man, start it up.

01:26:35.278 --> 01:26:37.320
I can't.

01:26:37.322 --> 01:26:43.617
It's dead.

01:26:48.957 --> 01:26:50.458
She's hit.

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:51.750
Let's get her back in here.

01:26:51.752 --> 01:26:54.088
Wait wait wait, just
wait, I see him.

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.175
You got a plan?

01:26:58.301 --> 01:26:59.469
I'm not
leaving her like that.

01:27:14.317 --> 01:27:16.903
Oh, awful sound you're making.

01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:20.073
One of your lungs is collapsed.

01:27:21.783 --> 01:27:24.659
The other one is probably
filling with liquid.

01:27:24.661 --> 01:27:26.244
What am I telling you?

01:27:26.246 --> 01:27:27.370
You know that, right?

01:27:27.372 --> 01:27:28.957
Suck my dick.

01:27:30.875 --> 01:27:31.710
Maybe not.

01:27:34.003 --> 01:27:36.715
Come on, come on
come on come on.

01:27:38.132 --> 01:27:43.678
It's a terrible way to go.

01:28:01.322 --> 01:28:02.282
God damn fuck!

01:28:05.493 --> 01:28:07.285
Fuck it!

01:28:09.788 --> 01:28:14.500
Alright, I'm done.

01:28:14.502 --> 01:28:15.712
Is this funny to you?

01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:18.922
Fucking Dean.

01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:09.516
Hey hey just stop, stop, Brie.

01:29:11.266 --> 01:29:12.976
Watch your arm, Brie.

01:29:14.479 --> 01:29:20.650
We gotta go.

01:29:20.652 --> 01:29:22.317
Come here, I'll
get you outta here.

01:29:22.319 --> 01:29:24.322
- You can do it.
- I can't.

01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:49.178
Brie come on,
we gotta go, now.

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:50.682
Go home, Eric.

01:29:52.391 --> 01:29:53.268
I got this.

01:30:10.452 --> 01:30:11.784
Go to hell, asshole.

01:30:18.792 --> 01:30:21.585
I can't believe that worked.

01:30:21.587 --> 01:30:24.088
No no no, where are you going?

01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:24.966
God damnit.

01:30:33.891 --> 01:30:35.516
What are we doing here?

01:30:35.518 --> 01:30:38.145
This has gone on long enough
right so unlock the door.

01:30:40.481 --> 01:30:43.318
Open the door, open
the goddamn door!

01:30:44.234 --> 01:30:49.946
And give me my money!

01:30:49.948 --> 01:30:51.158
And then I'll walk away.

01:30:54.662 --> 01:30:55.497
You have my word.

01:30:56.622 --> 01:30:57.830
You know what?

01:30:57.832 --> 01:30:59.292
Come and get it, asshole.

01:31:28.822 --> 01:31:30.821
So, last time.

01:31:30.823 --> 01:31:31.824
Where is it?

01:31:33.534 --> 01:31:38.286
Why are you making
this so difficult?

01:31:38.288 --> 01:31:41.790
I want my money!

01:31:41.792 --> 01:31:44.626
Fuck off.

01:31:44.628 --> 01:31:48.046
Ah!

01:31:48.048 --> 01:31:48.882
Fuck.

01:31:54.596 --> 01:31:56.390
Stupid motherfucker.

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:02.812
How dare you fucking
waste my time?

01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:05.772
All clear.

01:32:24.336 --> 01:32:26.585
This might sting a little.

01:33:16.136 --> 01:33:17.471
Dean, hey Dean.

01:33:19.765 --> 01:33:21.391
Look at that bullshit, huh?

01:33:22.394 --> 01:33:23.768
I'll call an ambulance.

01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:26.562
Oh you thought that was funny?

01:33:27.481 --> 01:33:33.152
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

01:33:33.154 --> 01:33:37.200
Brie, she was a wild one.

01:33:44.916 --> 01:33:45.748
Oh boy.

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:48.043
Hey, you never finished.

01:33:49.128 --> 01:33:50.378
What?

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:52.382
When you were telling
me why you do this.

01:33:58.095 --> 01:34:00.014
I don't know anymore.

01:34:01.181 --> 01:34:02.891
I guess I wanted to help people.

01:34:05.645 --> 01:34:06.646
Be a good person.

01:34:09.024 --> 01:34:11.026
But I fucked
everything up real bad.

01:34:15.195 --> 01:34:18.158
You still have a
chance to make it.

01:34:24.872 --> 01:34:25.706
Dean.

01:34:26.916 --> 01:34:28.499
No no no.

01:34:28.501 --> 01:34:31.126
Dean, come on.

01:34:36.091 --> 01:34:37.299
Like I was saying.

01:34:37.301 --> 01:34:38.385
Jesus, man.

01:34:39.929 --> 01:34:44.266
If Val covers for you, maybe
you can get away with this.

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:46.976
No one will know you were here.

01:34:46.978 --> 01:34:49.353
'Cause when you asked
to be put on the shift

01:34:49.355 --> 01:34:50.772
I didn't put you on
the schedule 'cause

01:34:50.774 --> 01:34:52.940
I didn't wanna pay you.

01:34:52.942 --> 01:34:55.819
And so you were never
there, there's no record.

01:34:58.698 --> 01:35:00.906
What about the crash,
the guy we picked up?

01:35:00.908 --> 01:35:02.282
No one was paying attention.

01:35:02.284 --> 01:35:04.910
If they gave a description
of the EMT that was with me

01:35:04.912 --> 01:35:10.958
they'd just say tall dark
hair, you know, walks funny.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.335
- That's me.
- Right.

01:35:12.337 --> 01:35:15.298
Or Reuben, who was
on the schedule.

01:35:23.472 --> 01:35:25.809
I kinda thought that Brie
would pull something so

01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:32.938
I put the money in
the side compartment.

01:35:34.484 --> 01:35:35.318
Take it.

01:35:37.069 --> 01:35:38.697
Do something good.

01:35:41.073 --> 01:35:42.701
Do something good.

01:37:54.541 --> 01:38:00.085
Morning, buddy.

01:38:00.087 --> 01:38:04.882
It's alright, I'm okay.

01:38:04.884 --> 01:38:05.719
You sleep okay?

01:38:08.137 --> 01:38:10.347
What happened?

01:38:11.349 --> 01:38:17.144
I'm fine.

01:38:17.146 --> 01:38:18.731
We're gonna be okay.

01:38:28.615 --> 01:38:30.157
And in local news.

01:38:30.159 --> 01:38:32.910
Police officers responding
to reports of heavy gunfire

01:38:32.912 --> 01:38:35.079
in the city of Vernon
made a grisly discovery

01:38:35.081 --> 01:38:37.456
at a medical transport
company with three confirmed

01:38:37.458 --> 01:38:39.041
fatalities so far.

01:38:39.043 --> 01:38:41.044
Two are reported
to be ICE agents

01:38:41.046 --> 01:38:43.379
but their identities have
not yet been released.

01:38:43.381 --> 01:38:46.007
Police have given no
indications that the shooting

01:38:46.009 --> 01:38:48.217
is connected to a fatal
hit and run involving

01:38:48.219 --> 01:38:51.514
an ICE agent earlier in the
evening less than a mile away.

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.473
It's seven o'clock.

01:39:29.594 --> 01:39:32.514
Turbo log,
May 11th, 11:45 PM.

01:39:34.056 --> 01:39:36.223
Oh boy, caught the new kid
Reuben smashing one out

01:39:36.225 --> 01:39:37.433
in the break room.

01:39:37.435 --> 01:39:39.059
Definitely awkward.

01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:41.062
Didn't fire him, just told
him to use the bathroom

01:39:41.064 --> 01:39:43.981
but I'm wondering did no one
ever have the talk with him?

01:39:43.983 --> 01:39:46.150
Reminder, check out
some blogs on parenting.

01:39:46.152 --> 01:39:47.652
And workplace masturbation.

01:39:47.654 --> 01:39:48.820
Dean out.

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:15.554
Turbo log, July 8th, 1:30 AM.

01:40:15.556 --> 01:40:17.514
Going on four days of
the silent treatment

01:40:17.516 --> 01:40:19.349
from El Erico.

01:40:19.351 --> 01:40:22.186
I'm guessing this is all
related to the July 4th

01:40:22.188 --> 01:40:26.566
barbecue event where apparently
I said something lewd

01:40:26.568 --> 01:40:27.858
to his wife.

01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:30.193
Look, I mixed a little
bit of bourbon with beer

01:40:30.195 --> 01:40:31.653
with cocaine that day.

01:40:31.655 --> 01:40:32.696
I'm not gonna celebrate?

01:40:32.698 --> 01:40:33.990
I'm a fucking American.

01:40:33.992 --> 01:40:36.451
And she was waving her
red white and blue fanny

01:40:36.453 --> 01:40:37.492
in my face.

01:40:37.494 --> 01:40:38.827
I guess I'll apologize.

01:40:38.829 --> 01:40:39.911
Dean out.

01:41:10.194 --> 01:41:13.153
Turbo log, July 9th, 1:45 AM.

01:41:13.155 --> 01:41:14.613
I think we accidentally

01:41:14.615 --> 01:41:17.200
hit a cat on the way
to a call tonight.

01:41:17.202 --> 01:41:18.951
Look, I don't have
anything against cats,

01:41:18.953 --> 01:41:21.245
I think that they're okay,
but for some reason I felt

01:41:21.247 --> 01:41:22.955
nothing, nothing.

01:41:22.957 --> 01:41:25.290
Reminder, check out WebMD
and see if that means that

01:41:25.292 --> 01:41:26.584
I'm a bad person.
