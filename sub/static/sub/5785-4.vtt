00:07.175 --> 00:10.008
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:10.303 --> 00:13.136
but secretly, with the help of my friends
at 8. TA. R. Labs,

00:13.347 --> 00:16.054
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.893 --> 00:19.726
I hunted down the man who killed
my mother, but in doing so,

00:19.937 --> 00:22.144
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.314
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

00:31.699 --> 00:35.237
And you thought you could pay me
to walk away from my own daughter?

00:35.453 --> 00:37.159
Last time you walked away for free.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.862
When you created the Singularity.
you also created a breach.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.989
A portal, connecting our two Earths.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.747
BARRY: You really think he's just
bringing these guys here to kill me?

00:44.962 --> 00:46.498
Zoom was obsessed with destroying me.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.045
Now he wants to destroy you?

00:48.257 --> 00:50.794
I'm starting to perceive things.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.125
Horrible things.

that life has its own plans for you,

01:20.915 --> 01:22.405
whether you like them or not.

01:23.376 --> 01:24.866
And so you're Ieﬁ with a choice.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.197

03:09.607 --> 03:12.644
to re-engineer Dr. Wells' original
stabilizer to quell the reaction.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.566
but I don't know what
he used as a power source.

03:14.779 --> 03:16.269
Best I could ﬁnd
was the one from his wheelchair.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.645
And how long will that last?

03:17.865 --> 03:20.823
Well, that's the problem is we had
already used up most of its energy

03:21.077 --> 03:22.192
trying to dampen the metas' powers

03:22.411 --> 03:25.118
during our little rogue air trip
with Weather Vlﬁzard and company.

Yeah. When he wakes up,
I'm gonna transfer the stabilizer to this.

Give him a power cane.
Get him moving.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.382

03:40.554 --> 03:42.886
the dark matter that collided
with Professor Stein

03:44.809 --> 03:48.347
and altered the normal molecular processes
that occurs within his body.

03:48.604 --> 03:51.016
Those highly-reactive molecules

03:51.232 --> 03:53.473
needed something to bond
with in order to stabilize.

03:53.692 --> 03:54.818

03:55.027 --> 03:58.736
Yes. and now that Ronnie is no longer
a part of Professor Stein—

03:58.948 --> 04:00.358
Those molecules don't have anything
to bond to.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.032
And the longer he goes without merging,
the more unstable he becomes.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.485

04:07.164 --> 04:09.746
All right, so what do we do?

04:09.959 --> 04:12.416
Find another participant.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.539
Okay, cool. So how do we do that?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.791
Are we just gonna make a Tinder app
for potential meta-humans?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.714
'Cause I'm pretty sure merging with Stein
and randomly bursting into ﬂames

04:19.927 --> 04:21.428

04:22.263 --> 04:24.970
Even if we could ﬁnd someone willing,

04:25.182 --> 04:27.138
Stein can't just merge
with whoever he wants.

No, he can't.
But I have done some research,

04:29.603 --> 04:33.266

that might be compatible with him.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.056
They both were affected
by the dark matter.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.561
And they were both admitted
to the hospital

04:36.777 --> 04:39.109
showing symptoms of gene
rearrangement mutation.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.897
And they both share the same blood type
as Professor Stein and Ronnie.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.194
This is more than organ donation.

04:47.413 --> 04:50.871
We'll need more than tissue typing
to see if their bodies are compatible.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.916
If I can isolate the genetic locus
of the two candidates

04:54.128 --> 04:57.086
and cross-reference it
with the mutations in Professor Stein,

04:57.298 --> 04:59.880

08:39.395 --> 08:40.885
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

08:41.105 --> 08:42.811
and cross-matching was negative for both.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.106
And it appears that the dark matter
from the Particle Accelerator explosion

08:46.318 --> 08:49.310
mutated their genes
in a very similar way it did to yours.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.442
-I think they're both potential matches.
-So, who do we go with?

08:52.658 --> 08:55.024
Well, my ﬁrst choice is Henry Hewitt.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.072
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson University,

08:58.288 --> 09:00.950
with a double major
in Applied Physics and Bioengineering.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.702
A Hudson boy. I like him already.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.206
He's got the physical attributes.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.588
And it looks like more of his alleles
match than Hewitt's.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.170
Doesn't that mean
that he's more compatible?

09:16.390 --> 09:19.382
On paper, perhaps.
But Hewitt is a scientist.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.853
Clearly, he's trying
to make something of his life.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.178
I think he'd be open
to something like this.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.810
I think we should meet with both of them
before we make a decision.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.516
-That's an excellent idea.
-I'II see if I can get Hewitt here.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.898
All right. In the meantime,
we'll go meet with Jefferson Jackson.

to help keep you stable.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.319
If you would consider coming back
to S.T.A.R. Labs with us,

10:56.532 --> 10:57.897
I believe we can help you.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.573
Help me, how?

10:59.785 --> 11:02.948
Well, we know what
the Particle Accelerator did.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.903
Look, I already told you,
I don't talk about that night.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.158
Why is that?

11:06.375 --> 11:09.037
Because that's when everything changed.
Look, I got hit hard.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.663
When I woke up, I was in the hospital.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.380
Busted up leg, torn ACL.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.129
The look on my mom's face.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.753
I knew any dreams I had
of playing pro-ball were over.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.550
-I'm sony to hear that.
-Yeah.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.002
Well...

11:20.222 --> 11:21.507
Look, I got to get back to work.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.130
Yeah. Um...

11:24.309 --> 11:25.845
Here, it's just...

11:26.603 --> 11:28.218
It's our number.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.971

11:46.081 --> 11:48.037

this together, Joseph.

Hello, Iris.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.058
Can I get you a coffee or something?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.516
Um, no, thanks.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.446
Let's just sit.

12:20.282 --> 12:23.740
I can't get over what a beautiful,
young woman you've become.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.692
And a journalist?

12:26.163 --> 12:27.528
I'm so proud of you.

12:28.665 --> 12:29.916
Why are you here?

12:30.751 --> 12:31.991
Why now?

12:32.294 --> 12:33.534
ummm

12:34.713 --> 12:36.795
I want to make this right with you.

12:37.174 --> 12:40.007
How about you start
by apologizing for walking out on us?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.716
I am sony.

12:42.638 --> 12:44.549
So very, very sony.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.515
There's so much you don't know.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.844
I'm sure that you've been through
a great deal.

12:53.023 --> 12:56.106
And I can appreciate you feeling like
this is suddenly the right time

12:56.318 --> 12:57.933
for you to want me in your life.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.190
But that doesn't mean
that it's the right time for me.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.606
-Iris?
-No, Dad, it's okay.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.618
I've thought about this a lot.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.985
And it wasn't fair
for me to make you the bad guy.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.245
So, I want you to hear this from me.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.492
I don't hate you, Francine.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.876
I do wish you well.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.501
But we have lived separate lives
for over 20 years.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.152
Hi, I'm glad you're back.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.658
This is Dr. Henry Hewitt.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.956
This is Bany Allen

13:55.210 --> 13:57.667
-How do you do?
-The illustrious Martin Stein.

13:57.879 --> 14:01.417
I've read all your papers back at Hudson.
especially on transmutation.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.873
Fascinating.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.673
You're a legend.

my contribution to the ﬁeld. I...

14:08.098 --> 14:09.178

14:09.391 --> 14:13.054
Yeah. He's got an ego the size of Texas.
but. yeah, he's all right.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.518
So, where's Jefferson Jackson?

14:15.731 --> 14:18.143
-We just need more time.
-We don't have more time.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.598
I couldn't ﬁnd another power source
for the cane.

14:19.776 --> 14:20.811

14:20.986 --> 14:23.102
Okay. Then let's do the merge.
Hewitt's in.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.487
What do you mean? You told him the details
of the Firestorm Matrix?

14:25.657 --> 14:27.943
Absolutely. Becoming Firestorm
is a huge life change.

-It's gonna work.
-Yeah?

That's a molecular primer
being released into your body.

Then, you can make physical contact
with Professor Stein.

this was a sensitive matter.

What? Why?

18:17.389 --> 18:18.424

20:46.579 --> 20:47.864
What kind of capabilities?

20:50.708 --> 20:54.292
The ability for your body
to process ﬁssion and fusion.

Wanted for questioning is scientist,

26:04.480 --> 26:07.472
Hewitt's dormant abilities must have been
triggered when we attempted the merger.

This could be catastrophic.

26:11.404 --> 26:16.524
he requires a grounding mechanism
to stabilize his volatility. Otherwise—

26:16.909 --> 26:18.160
Yeah. He's gonna pop his top.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.818

according to his police record.

isn't the only one in question.

that he has what it takes.

This isn't because
you didn't believe in him.

Sometimes, great possibilities
are right in front of us,

27:15.885 --> 27:18.092
and we don't see them
because we choose not to.

27:19.388 --> 27:24.382
I think that we need to be open
to exploring something new.

If you want to have a relationship
with Francine, it's okay with me.

You don't have to protect me.

I'm a grown man, and I've dealt
with these feelings a long time ago.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.921
So, you— You just believe her?

28:00.513 --> 28:04.256
She's done some bad things in her life,
but she wouldn't lie about this.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.810
Dad, she shows up out of nowhere,

28:07.019 --> 28:10.261
and she only says that she's dying
after I told her to stay away?

28:11.148 --> 28:14.106
Look, she didn't come to Central City
to see me.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.603
She came because of you.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.434
I just wanted you to know everything

so you can make
the best decision for yourself.

Professor Stein's other half.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.400
He actually helped to build
the Particle Accelerator,

29:05.661 --> 29:09.324
and when it exploded,
he was affected by it, too.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.333

to show the world

29:14.503 --> 29:17.836

29:19.425 --> 29:21.336

36:09.084 --> 36:10.415
My dad told me you were sick.

36:12.421 --> 36:14.912
You know, I wasn't sure
that I could believe you,

36:15.591 --> 36:16.876
so I did some checking.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.470
Turns out you're telling the truth.

36:20.721 --> 36:23.633
I would never lie to you
about something so big.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.551
Really?

36:27.269 --> 36:29.806
'Cause I was actually thinking
that I could give you another chance

36:30.064 --> 36:31.270
after hearing that news.

36:33.776 --> 36:35.767
But you are still lying.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.109
Still keeping secrets.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.648
I am an investigative reporter, Francine.

36:42.910 --> 36:45.993
I uncover things
that people want to keep hidden.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.445
Like having a son.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.411
He was born eight months
after you left Central City.

36:52.628 --> 36:55.620
-Let me explain.
-Who's the father, Francine?

36:56.298 --> 36:57.583
Is it my dad?

36:59.968 --> 37:01.174
IMlmmiETﬂ

37:03.472 --> 37:06.305
Wait, you know what, I don't—
I don't even want to know.

37:07.101 --> 37:09.137
I mean, I wouldn't be able to tell
if you were telling the truth

37:09.311 --> 37:11.142
or if it was another one
of your lies, anyway.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.686
(SIGHS)

37:13.982 --> 37:15.267
I want you to leave.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.147
You stay away from me,
and you stay away from my father.

37:19.988 --> 37:23.151
If he ﬁnds out that he might have a son
that grew up without knowing him,

37:23.325 --> 37:25.111
WFMHM

37:25.994 --> 37:27.279
Just...

37:38.674 --> 37:39.834
.HA‘RHIIHATIFIMMIIWI

37:40.008 --> 37:42.545
Seems like that last burst of energy
has burnt him out.

37:42.803 --> 37:44.339
Our tokamak's gone dark.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.217
Hey, we're just gonna keep him
safe and sound in the pipeline

37:47.474 --> 37:49.339
till he decides to keep quiet
about all this.

37:49.518 --> 37:50.974
So you're gonna meet up with Clarissa?

37:51.186 --> 37:52.687
We're meeting in Pittsburgh in three days.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.015
Why Pittsburgh?

37:54.189 --> 37:57.852
A colleague of mine was monumental
in helping train Ronald and me.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.024
She's graciously offered
to help the two of us as well.

38:00.237 --> 38:01.522
Well, how is she going to help us?

38:01.697 --> 38:03.528
Well, there were many aspects
of our abilities

38:03.740 --> 38:05.526
that we never quite achieved.

38:05.742 --> 38:09.360
Hopefully now,
we can fully realize that potential.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.992
My dearest Dr. Snow.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.330
Ronald may be lost to us,

38:21.925 --> 38:23.210
but he will never be forgotten.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.385
Speaking of,

38:28.390 --> 38:30.381
HMRM

38:31.018 --> 38:33.509
He always used it
to ﬁnd his way back home.

38:33.854 --> 38:35.060
I want you to have it.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.394
Thank you.

38:41.612 --> 38:43.227
You know, this whole thing is strange.

38:43.405 --> 38:44.906
Being 50% of someone.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.401
Yeah, but you're 100% a hero.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.951
I went ahead
and re-calibrated the splicer,

38:52.206 --> 38:53.912
so the merging should be
even smoother now.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.117
Thank you.

38:55.292 --> 38:58.125
If I may offer you a bit
of parting advice.

38:59.296 --> 39:02.038
Cisco. I know you're scared,

39:02.591 --> 39:05.754
but this ability you have is a gift.

39:05.969 --> 39:09.382
Not a curse. It's natural to be
apprehensive about the unknown.

39:09.640 --> 39:10.925
But look, look at Jefferson.

39:11.141 --> 39:15.100
He took a leap,
and it changed his life for the better.

39:17.189 --> 39:21.432
The very thing that makes you different
is what makes you special.

39:23.612 --> 39:25.273
Tell your friends.

39:31.245 --> 39:34.282
And now, I believe it's time to
take this show on the road,

39:34.540 --> 39:36.622
or to the sky, if I'm to be literal.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.908
(ALL LAUGHING)

39:44.800 --> 39:46.756
Are you ready, Jefferson?

40:04.570 --> 40:06.902
-All right. Yeah.
-See you later.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.447
That was one hell of a leap of faith
that kid took,

40:10.659 --> 40:12.149
merging with Professor Stein.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.491
Yeah, it was.

40:13.662 --> 40:16.324
There is a lesson in there
somewhere for you.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.657
BARRY: Things aren't always
what they seem.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.667
Our fears can play tricks on us.

40:22.838 --> 40:26.330
Making us aﬁaid to change course,
aﬁaid to move on.

40:27.092 --> 40:31.677
But usually, hidden behind our fears
are second chances waiting to be seized.

40:50.824 --> 40:52.189
At family.

40:58.332 --> 40:59.538
At love.

41:00.876 --> 41:03.367
And these opportunities
don't come around every day.

41:03.545 --> 41:05.877
So when they do, we have to be brave.

41:06.173 --> 41:09.040
Take a chance,
and grab them while we can.

41:12.387 --> 41:14.218
Zoom wants you dead.

41:14.723 --> 41:16.714

Oh, my God, it's reall
