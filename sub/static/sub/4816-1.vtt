02:41.148 --> 02:44.083
<i>The Vietnam peace talks</i>
<i>are continuing here in Paris today...</i>

02:44.151 --> 02:49.111
<i>... against the background of what to do</i>
<i>about the release of American POWs.</i>

02:49.356 --> 02:52.189
<i>In the United States,</i>
<i>sentiment is running high...</i>

02:52.259 --> 02:56.389
<i>... for a complete accounting</i>
<i>for all of the POWs and MIAs...</i>

02:56.797 --> 03:01.063
<i>... those listed as Missing in Action,</i>
<i>before any treaty is signed.</i>

03:01.568 --> 03:04.196
<i>The prisoners, men such as these...</i>

03:04.371 --> 03:08.808
<i>... are Americans who have been captured</i>
<i>during the 10 years of fighting in Vietnam.</i>

03:08.942 --> 03:11.206
<i>The Undersecretary of State,</i>
<i>Conrad Morgan...</i>

03:11.278 --> 03:13.906
<i>... is the chief American delegate</i>
<i>to the talks.</i>

03:13.981 --> 03:18.247
<i>This morning, outside the mansion</i>
<i>in which the talks are being held...</i>

03:18.418 --> 03:21.216
<i>... Morgan told reporters</i>
<i>that he is optimistic.</i>

03:21.288 --> 03:22.448
<i>I now sincerely believe...</i>

03:22.523 --> 03:25.492
<i>... the North Vietnamese delegates</i>
<i>are dealing in good faith...</i>

03:25.559 --> 03:28.153
<i>... and that significant progress</i>
<i>can now be made.</i>

03:28.228 --> 03:30.423
<i>As chief delegate to these talks...</i>

03:30.497 --> 03:33.022
<i>... are you saying a final agreement</i>
<i>has been reached?</i>

03:33.100 --> 03:34.658
<i>What I'm saying is what I said.</i>

03:34.735 --> 03:39.263
<i>The situation is e</i> x <i>tremely delicate,</i>
<i>but significant progress can now be made.</i>

03:39.339 --> 03:41.603
<i>Is that clear? I certainly hope it is...</i>

03:41.675 --> 03:45.611
<i>... because I would appreciate</i>
<i>those of the press getting that straight.</i>

03:45.679 --> 03:50.048
<i>What if Kuong Yen decides to throw</i>
<i>new roadblocks into these negotiations?</i>

03:50.117 --> 03:53.109
<i>I suppose we'll have to</i>
<i>take things one step at a time.</i>

03:53.186 --> 03:57.623
<i>There is one more question the American</i>
<i>public deserves to have answered.</i>

03:57.691 --> 03:59.386
<i>What about the Missing in Action?</i>

03:59.459 --> 04:01.586
<i>Have you and Kuong Yen</i>
<i>discussed that at all?</i>

04:01.662 --> 04:03.220
<i>Of course we have discussed that...</i>

04:03.297 --> 04:06.323
<i>... and we will continue</i>
<i>to discuss that question.</i>

04:06.400 --> 04:09.836
<i>But I'm sure you can all realize,</i>
<i>that is of such a sensitive nature...</i>

04:09.903 --> 04:12.064
<i>... I'm not at liberty to go into that now.</i>

04:12.139 --> 04:16.075
<i>I can only say this: I'm very hopeful</i>
<i>that we will arrive at a solution.</i>

04:16.310 --> 04:20.303
- What the hell are you doing in my room?
- You told me to meet you here.

04:20.380 --> 04:23.872
Could have waited in the lobby.
Turn that goddamn thing off, please.

04:23.951 --> 04:25.077
I'm enjoying it.

04:25.152 --> 04:28.679
<i>Mr. Morgan, please,</i>
<i>can we have a statement before you...</i>

04:28.822 --> 04:30.187
Harolds?

04:30.624 --> 04:33.616
- Come on, bring that shit in here!
- Coming.

04:36.763 --> 04:39.459
I'm not as nimble as I used to be.

04:43.270 --> 04:44.999
Nor as coordinated.

04:46.473 --> 04:49.738
Actually, Conrad,
I have always been rather clumsy.

04:52.579 --> 04:56.481
When you get that stuff cleaned up,
make me a scotch, will you please?

04:56.617 --> 04:59.347
So, the war is over, Mr. Undersecretary?

04:59.987 --> 05:02.683
You're practically a national treasure.

05:02.990 --> 05:04.514
Son of a bitch.

05:05.292 --> 05:07.487
Which son of a bitch is that?

05:08.195 --> 05:10.425
Hope they cut his balls off.

05:10.764 --> 05:14.860
- Give Harolds a pair of scissors.
- When the time's right, I'll do that myself.

05:16.069 --> 05:18.469
Sounds like your private meeting
with Kuong Yen...

05:18.538 --> 05:22.941
...was what you guys in State
called "a frank discussion of the issues."

05:23.110 --> 05:25.578
What the hell is this,
some kind of a joke to you?

05:25.646 --> 05:27.910
- You could say so.
- It's not to me.

05:27.981 --> 05:29.812
Somebody's gotta take it seriously.

05:29.883 --> 05:32.943
I told 'em I didn't need
any goddamn CIA help on this thing...

05:33.020 --> 05:34.885
And they shove me down your throat!

05:34.955 --> 05:39.449
We've been through this before, Morgan.
Now, what the hell is it this time?

05:41.862 --> 05:44.524
How many of your CIA people
are the VC holding?

05:44.598 --> 05:45.758
What are you talking about?

05:45.832 --> 05:47.857
Save that bullshit for Congress.
How many?

05:47.934 --> 05:49.458
150, maybe. Why?

05:50.070 --> 05:51.332
They're dead.

05:51.705 --> 05:56.165
The fact that we have positive information
to the contrary is irrelevant.

05:56.810 --> 05:58.539
He wants a sacrifice.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.614
Speak intelligently, Morgan.

06:01.682 --> 06:04.810
As an addendum to the peace terms,
Kuong Yen wants a sacrifice.

06:04.885 --> 06:06.819
Call Omaha and get a flock of sheep.

06:06.887 --> 06:09.151
He claims he's lost a lot of family
to you people.

06:09.222 --> 06:12.453
This isn't important, of course,
but I also think he's a psychopath.

06:12.659 --> 06:15.127
That makes him unique in this business,
doesn't it?

06:15.195 --> 06:19.598
In any case, we agree to write off
those people as Missing in Action...

06:19.700 --> 06:23.898
...and they agree to call off the war
and give us a lot of other people back.

06:24.071 --> 06:25.231
And you agreed?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.107
I didn't agree to anything.

06:29.976 --> 06:32.274
You practical son of a bitch!

06:32.345 --> 06:36.975
You're gonna cash in those people's lives
just for a shot at the Nobel Peace Prize!

06:37.050 --> 06:39.348
Saunders, don't get sanctimonious
with me.

06:39.453 --> 06:41.978
Nobody's gonna win anything
when this war's over.

06:42.055 --> 06:44.990
If the VC want 'em dead so bad,
why don't they just kill 'em?

06:45.058 --> 06:48.050
They won't because they're worth
too much as a bargaining point.

06:48.128 --> 06:50.221
Wrong. They'll kill 'em...

06:50.831 --> 06:52.924
...as soon as they sign the treaty...

06:53.066 --> 06:57.332
...or they'll hold them as MIA
till they're through interrogating them.

06:57.671 --> 07:00.868
In any case, what I'm trying to say is
we have to at least try...

07:00.941 --> 07:03.876
...to get some of those people out of there.

07:04.444 --> 07:06.810
I hate to think I've been misjudging you.

07:09.483 --> 07:11.246
That would be unfortunate.

07:11.318 --> 07:12.979
What do you call the commandoes...

07:13.053 --> 07:15.886
...you're holding
under the Phoenix umbrella?

07:16.056 --> 07:17.523
Black Tigers.

07:18.558 --> 07:21.891
Who the hell thinks up names like that?
Black Tigers!

07:21.962 --> 07:24.863
Actually, a group of us did,
some years ago.

07:26.333 --> 07:29.393
Don't let anybody kid you, Harolds.
It's a great name.

07:29.469 --> 07:33.838
- Can they get your people out?
- I don't know, it's very risky business.

07:34.241 --> 07:37.233
Take at least a couple of weeks
for an operation like that.

07:37.310 --> 07:38.402
Forty-eight hours.

07:42.783 --> 07:44.910
Forty-eight hours? Right.

07:47.087 --> 07:50.921
What about staging a major operation
in the middle of your peace talks?

07:51.758 --> 07:53.453
I'll worry about the diplomacy.

07:59.933 --> 08:03.926
I get the feeling I'm offending
some sensibility in you.

08:04.671 --> 08:08.539
The American public is crying for peace.
I intend to achieve it for them.

08:09.376 --> 08:12.812
Like I said,
you're practically a national treasure.

08:31.231 --> 08:33.028
Saunders, when this war is over...

08:33.099 --> 08:35.794
...you should get a job
as an advance man for cancer.

08:36.203 --> 08:38.364
In support of the disease or the cure?

08:38.438 --> 08:40.736
I sometimes find it difficult to understand...

08:40.807 --> 08:43.900
...the American custom of joking
during a time of crisis.

08:44.711 --> 08:46.872
How certain are you of your intelligence?

08:47.781 --> 08:50.045
To be perfectly honest with you,
Maj. Mhin...

08:50.116 --> 08:53.847
...the only thing certain about intelligence
is uncertainty.

08:54.855 --> 08:56.982
As usual, you're a big help.

08:57.357 --> 09:00.793
This better be as important
as your boys at headquarters said it was.

09:00.861 --> 09:02.385
Let's go, Mhin.

09:05.866 --> 09:10.394
What do you think Prince will say when
we come walking in there after him?

09:10.470 --> 09:13.200
"You came a long way, Fred,
to collect your bread."

09:13.273 --> 09:16.572
- That's what he's going to say.
- You'd better believe that, baby.

09:16.710 --> 09:20.043
What makes them think Hanoi
will sit still for this kind of stunt?

09:20.113 --> 09:22.707
It must make sense
or they wouldn't be sending us.

09:22.782 --> 09:26.274
One camp. What good could it do?
The POWs are in dozens of camps.

09:26.353 --> 09:28.821
It's the camp with the most guys in it.

09:28.889 --> 09:33.087
I do not see how a raid at this time
can do anything but harm the negotiations.

09:34.294 --> 09:36.421
Major, I thought
the goddamn war was over.

09:36.696 --> 09:38.891
So did I, but it's not. What's your point?

09:38.965 --> 09:42.594
The point is we don't want to be
the last guys killed in this war...

09:42.669 --> 09:44.728
...if there's someone else available.

09:44.804 --> 09:47.466
I think they've got us down
for second to last.

09:48.275 --> 09:51.904
Whatever happened to the good old days
when Randolph Scott and John Wayne...

09:51.978 --> 09:55.778
...were happy to get their asses blown off
for the good ol' US of A?

09:55.849 --> 09:57.840
Who the hell is Randolph Scott?

09:58.018 --> 10:01.510
Randolph Scott Key:
dude who wrote the national anthem!

10:02.022 --> 10:03.546
Oh, that Randolph Scott!

10:03.623 --> 10:06.524
You can joke if you want,
but I've got a score to settle.

10:06.593 --> 10:08.925
That's the spirit, Gordie, an ear for an ear!

10:08.995 --> 10:11.395
I said not to joke around
about my ears, didn't I?

10:11.765 --> 10:14.598
You're gonna have a hard time
finding an ear that size.

10:14.668 --> 10:18.331
Just give me a couple whole heads.
I'll use what I need.

10:18.772 --> 10:21.434
What do you know? We can go first class!

10:21.508 --> 10:23.567
- You gonna serve coffee, Randolph?
- Sure!

10:23.643 --> 10:25.577
I want Lola Falana to serve my coffee!

10:25.645 --> 10:28.170
- Gonna be a movie on this flight?
- Yeah.

16:56.001 --> 16:56.990
Mhin?

17:15.353 --> 17:17.820
- Major, over here!
- Get in!

17:53.992 --> 17:55.687
Gordie, he's hit!

17:56.895 --> 17:57.953
Get him.

17:59.931 --> 18:03.162
- Come on!
- All right, let's get out!

18:05.303 --> 18:06.964
- Get him!
- Come on!

18:07.539 --> 18:09.734
- What's the matter?
- Goddamn thing won't start!

18:13.478 --> 18:14.706
Come on!

18:21.253 --> 18:23.551
Get out! Move out! Let's go!

18:24.189 --> 18:25.281
Come on!

18:45.310 --> 18:48.211
Come on, Gordie. We gotta run!

18:49.014 --> 18:50.606
Where we running, Mike?

18:51.182 --> 18:53.946
Are we late for the train or something?

19:08.967 --> 19:10.696
Where the hell are the choppers?

19:10.769 --> 19:13.738
The choppers aren't here.
Why don't we take the train?

19:15.707 --> 19:16.696
Radio.

19:19.844 --> 19:22.335
Nighthawk, this is Tiger 1. Over.

19:32.590 --> 19:34.751
Somebody's going to pay for this screwup.

19:35.226 --> 19:36.625
I think I know who.

19:36.695 --> 19:38.822
Yeah, us.

19:41.533 --> 19:46.027
Nighthawk, this is Tiger 1.
We're at LZ and waiting for pickup. Over.

19:51.242 --> 19:52.368
I don't get it.

19:53.078 --> 19:57.777
Everything went wrong by the numbers
and that takes planning.

20:02.387 --> 20:04.150
What are you talking about?

20:05.390 --> 20:07.620
I'm saying we've been set up.

20:13.965 --> 20:15.330
Where are the choppers?

20:17.335 --> 20:19.929
I just told you, Gordie, it was a screwup.

20:20.372 --> 20:22.533
I like choppers. They're like birds.

20:22.607 --> 20:25.906
- You like birds, don't you?
- Sure I do, Gordie.

20:27.345 --> 20:28.676
Jesus.

20:28.913 --> 20:30.813
Where are the choppers?

20:31.883 --> 20:34.545
I like choppers. They're like birds.

20:34.619 --> 20:37.986
I shot a bird once.
My daddy took my rifle away...

20:40.058 --> 20:42.322
- Take care of him, Mike.
- Yeah.

20:43.428 --> 20:45.658
- What do we do now?
- Survive.

20:45.730 --> 20:47.527
Lou, the point. Walker, the rear.

20:47.599 --> 20:50.090
- Where are you going, Mike?
- Going home.

20:50.168 --> 20:54.002
- What do I do, walk out?
- lf you spot a taxi, flag it down.

22:48.051 --> 22:50.986
- How'd it feel?
- A hell of a lot better!

22:52.088 --> 22:55.387
Let's clean her out
and I'll give her another try.

23:00.263 --> 23:03.232
I think our troubles with this baby
are just about history.

23:03.300 --> 23:07.361
You spend one more minute with this car,
I think that baby there will be history.

23:08.138 --> 23:10.766
Damn, can you believe
I forgot all about her?

23:10.841 --> 23:14.368
Any man who forgets her
needs a lube job and oil change real bad.

23:14.444 --> 23:16.309
I can't wait to get her on the rack.

23:20.317 --> 23:23.650
Goddamn it, Booker, what's a girl
have to do to get your attention?

23:25.555 --> 23:27.182
I'm sorry, Kelly.

23:33.096 --> 23:37.362
You're really going to be mad.
I've got a class to teach in one hour.

23:37.734 --> 23:38.826
Shit.

23:46.810 --> 23:49.176
Come on, Booker, get in.

24:06.630 --> 24:10.259
And so, as history slowly places it
into some kind of perspective...

24:10.400 --> 24:13.858
...a few things about the Vietnam War
have become clear.

24:14.137 --> 24:16.298
It was a war
that never should have begun...

24:16.373 --> 24:18.568
...in a country
we never should have entered.

24:18.642 --> 24:23.011
And its thousands of victims died
without really understanding why...

24:24.247 --> 24:28.183
...mainly because the reasons for the war
were beyond any rules of logic.

24:30.453 --> 24:35.186
On Wednesday, we'll sing patriotic songs
and pretend I said none of the above.

24:37.093 --> 24:38.720
- Good lecture, man.
- Thank you.

24:38.795 --> 24:40.695
- See you, Booker.
- Okay.

24:54.110 --> 24:56.101
I hope you didn't mind my sitting in.

24:57.247 --> 24:59.875
It seems a long way from the '60s,
doesn't it?

24:59.950 --> 25:01.417
Yes, it does.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.484
Can I take you to lunch?

25:05.121 --> 25:07.589
I don't eat lunch. Who are you?

25:08.591 --> 25:11.287
Let me take you to dinner and find out.

25:11.361 --> 25:13.829
- You do eat dinner?
- I've been known to.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.225
I'm on an expense account.

25:20.203 --> 25:21.636
You're a reporter.

25:21.705 --> 25:24.799
Why else would I fly all the way out
from Washington to see you?

25:24.874 --> 25:26.341
I don't know.

25:28.645 --> 25:30.476
Pick me up at 7:00?

25:31.081 --> 25:32.207
7:00 is too late.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.448
For us?

25:34.684 --> 25:37.244
For dinner. How about 5:30?

25:37.520 --> 25:40.045
At 5:30 in Washington,
they're still out to lunch.

25:40.557 --> 25:42.752
In Washington, they're always out to lunch.

25:42.826 --> 25:46.762
Besides, I have a feeling
this might be a very interesting evening.

25:48.999 --> 25:51.058
You're the professor, Professor.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.749
- That's it, mister.
- That's a good job.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.387
Too bad you weren't born black.

26:13.456 --> 26:16.220
There might have been a future
in this for you.

26:16.292 --> 26:19.022
Hey, mister, you forgot your newspaper.

26:19.896 --> 26:22.364
- 19 and 25.
- Thank you, my man.

28:06.636 --> 28:08.035
Quite a car.

28:08.605 --> 28:11.665
Not exactly ideal for going
from stoplight to stoplight, is it?

28:11.741 --> 28:14.869
- Only if they're 200 miles apart.
- Pretty much for a grad student.

28:14.944 --> 28:19.711
I do test driving, and like a damn fool,
I took the car instead of the salary.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.688
What the hell is he trying to do?

29:08.831 --> 29:09.889
Hang on!

29:26.816 --> 29:29.011
You son of a bitch,
what the hell's going on?

29:29.085 --> 29:30.814
Relax! The accelerator pedal stuck!

29:30.887 --> 29:33.913
- What?
- I said, "The accelerator pedal stuck!"

29:33.990 --> 29:36.015
Why didn't you kill the engine?

29:36.092 --> 29:39.152
Because I thought
I could kick the pedal loose.

29:50.740 --> 29:52.741
What the hell was that all about?

29:52.874 --> 29:55.172
- I wish I knew.
- I think I need a drink.

29:55.243 --> 29:59.577
- Any place in particular?
- Your place. As long as you drive carefully.

30:01.449 --> 30:04.714
<i>Are most of your days usually</i>
<i>as e</i> x <i>citing as this one?</i>

30:04.786 --> 30:08.620
<i>Not quite, but I've got a feeling</i>
<i>things are about to change.</i>

30:08.690 --> 30:10.225
<i>If you've got something to say, say it.</i>

30:10.225 --> 30:10.691
<i>If you've got something to say, say it.</i>

30:10.759 --> 30:14.923
You were on a top-secret mission to rescue
some POWs at the end of the war.

30:17.866 --> 30:19.265
No response?

30:19.400 --> 30:22.392
I get it.
You're writing a book about the war.

30:25.173 --> 30:26.936
Something like that.

30:27.909 --> 30:31.606
When you arrived at the camp,
there were no POWs, only Vietcong.

30:31.679 --> 30:33.704
You lost most of your men.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.344
I wonder who told you about that.
It was all top secret.

30:38.653 --> 30:39.813
Shall I go on?

30:42.390 --> 30:43.482
Are you married?

30:43.558 --> 30:47.255
After the raid, you were to be met
and flown to safety with the POWs.

30:47.328 --> 30:48.989
The helicopters didn't show...

30:49.063 --> 30:52.521
...so you marched out of the jungle
with five of your men.

30:55.870 --> 30:56.996
Do you fool around?

31:03.912 --> 31:07.075
It took you three weeks
to get out of the jungle.

31:07.615 --> 31:11.517
Then you were, as they say,
"debriefed" in the hospital for two months.

31:11.586 --> 31:14.487
Nothing was ever printed
about that strange sortie.

31:15.223 --> 31:16.781
Why not?

31:17.725 --> 31:19.124
How about something to eat?

31:19.194 --> 31:23.255
What ever happened to those POWs
who weren't there to be rescued?

31:23.498 --> 31:25.864
Have they been returned? Are they MIA?

31:26.167 --> 31:27.657
Are they dead?

31:28.570 --> 31:31.038
Will anybody admit that they ever existed?

31:31.940 --> 31:36.240
- Will you answer any of those questions?
- Now, what can you do with one egg?

31:44.485 --> 31:45.816
Watch out.

31:48.523 --> 31:52.960
Nice selection. We can sauté these.

31:53.027 --> 31:55.518
I tried it once. I didn't like it.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.395
How about some frozen halibut?

32:01.269 --> 32:04.102
Your unit was a part of Operation Phoenix.

32:04.806 --> 32:07.741
Its job was to neutralize,
I believe they called it...

32:07.809 --> 32:10.073
...the Vietcong undercover agents.

32:10.144 --> 32:13.079
You were also assigned
to rescue our own POWs.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.343
You're very intense for a girl with such...

32:21.089 --> 32:25.492
How about one egg
with oysters and sauerkraut?

32:28.196 --> 32:30.630
Are you going to tell me anything?

32:31.366 --> 32:33.698
There's really not much to tell.

32:34.168 --> 32:38.400
In the hospital, they told us the VC
intelligence had cracked our security.

32:38.473 --> 32:40.270
Reasonable possibility.

32:40.341 --> 32:42.502
They said our choppers
had been shot down.

32:42.577 --> 32:44.135
Reasonable possibility there.

32:44.712 --> 32:48.409
Then by the time they got replacements
to us, there was nothing but bodies.

32:48.483 --> 32:49.973
That's what they said.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.485
And like an obedient soldier,
you believed them.

32:53.087 --> 32:56.056
In the hospital,
I told myself the war was over.

32:56.124 --> 32:58.115
I lived through it, now put it behind you.

32:58.192 --> 33:01.992
I could spend years trying to find out
if somebody set us up.

33:02.297 --> 33:04.390
And if I found him, well...

33:04.666 --> 33:08.363
...he most likely would be someone
I couldn't get to anyway.

33:08.436 --> 33:10.495
What if he were someone you could get to?

33:11.773 --> 33:15.504
I decided no to waste my life
to avenge something I'd survived.

33:15.843 --> 33:19.074
It's over and I want to keep it that way.

33:20.281 --> 33:23.079
I don't believe you really feel that way.

33:23.518 --> 33:26.749
- Why are you asking all these questions?
- I can't tell you.

33:26.821 --> 33:28.789
Then stop asking them.

33:28.890 --> 33:32.382
I met a man at a cocktail party
in Washington.

33:32.961 --> 33:36.863
He was what the newspapers refer to as
"a high-ranking government official."

33:36.931 --> 33:38.694
He was also very drunk.

33:39.167 --> 33:41.727
The scotch seemed to break
some barrier in his mind.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.800
- He mentioned the Black Tigers.
- How's the sauerkraut coming?

33:47.508 --> 33:49.032
Coming nicely, thank you.

33:49.978 --> 33:51.536
John T. Booker:

33:51.846 --> 33:55.338
A man taking his Ph.D.
in Political Science...

33:56.117 --> 33:58.813
...who used to be a member of the CIA.

33:58.953 --> 34:02.218
- Sounds schizophrenic.
- I was never a member of the CIA.

34:02.657 --> 34:04.215
The Black Tigers were CIA.

34:07.595 --> 34:10.587
I didn't know the Freedom of Information
Act was that effective.

34:10.665 --> 34:12.860
It isn't, but I am.

34:14.034 --> 34:17.869
What do you think of Conrad Morgan
being named Secretary of State-Designate?

34:18.172 --> 34:20.402
- Nothing.
- Doesn't interest you?

34:20.641 --> 34:24.475
I'm only interested in finding out
what you're not telling me.

34:25.713 --> 34:30.672
Who's going to tell who first
what he or she isn't telling?

34:33.420 --> 34:35.821
Maybe I'll tell you after dinner.

34:37.091 --> 34:39.059
Or maybe in the morning.

34:40.594 --> 34:42.460
How about the morning?

35:43.658 --> 35:46.218
- Bad dream?
- Yeah.

35:47.128 --> 35:48.425
What?

36:02.477 --> 36:05.139
- You don't sleep well, do you?
- No.

36:05.379 --> 36:07.176
I don't either.

36:11.886 --> 36:13.615
Did I keep you awake?

36:14.555 --> 36:16.045
I didn't mind.

36:17.024 --> 36:19.857
- I'll make it up to you.
- You already have.

36:25.566 --> 36:27.363
How do you turn this thing off?

36:29.670 --> 36:31.535
Why does anyone who doesn't sleep well...

36:31.606 --> 36:35.736
...have an alarm that sounds like Big Ben
that can't be turned off?

36:37.745 --> 36:39.940
- Where are you going?
- To run.

36:43.251 --> 36:44.582
I run, too.

36:45.319 --> 36:47.014
Well, come along.

36:47.955 --> 36:50.947
I think I had sufficient exercise last night.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.554
- Breakfast?
- lf you can find anything.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.122
Of course, you don't eat breakfast.

37:05.940 --> 37:08.431
I'll see you in exactly 27 minutes.

37:08.543 --> 37:13.105
When I get back,
we can talk about breakfast, maybe.

37:52.384 --> 37:55.979
Hey, Murray.
Why don't you get an honest job?

37:56.856 --> 38:00.690
What, and give up my cloak and dagger?
John, I have to talk to you.

38:01.293 --> 38:03.591
Pull over. Gas is expensive.

38:15.875 --> 38:18.605
I know better than to ask
where you've been...

38:18.677 --> 38:20.770
...but that cigar smells like pure Havana.

38:20.846 --> 38:23.974
Fringe benefits.
John, what did you and Marilyn talk about?

38:25.384 --> 38:26.408
Do I know her?

38:26.485 --> 38:29.249
The reporter who seems to have
more answers than questions.

38:29.321 --> 38:32.154
You wouldn't be talking about a writer
named Margaret?

38:32.224 --> 38:36.024
She told me "Marilyn."
Next guy'll get "Myrna" or "Marilee."

38:36.095 --> 38:38.757
She's obviously in the "M's."
What did you tell her?

38:39.899 --> 38:43.335
I told her about a long walk I took
a couple of years ago.

38:43.402 --> 38:44.733
What did you tell her?

38:44.803 --> 38:48.534
Somebody told her more about
that mission than even you and I know.

38:48.607 --> 38:50.541
That scar is ugly, but it's healed.

38:51.076 --> 38:52.805
It's about to be reopened.

38:55.514 --> 38:58.312
"Operation Sandstone."
I don't recall that one.

38:58.517 --> 39:00.985
There was no Operation Sandstone.

39:01.086 --> 39:03.145
You see that line with "D.A." on it?

39:03.222 --> 39:07.056
It means that sometime during
an operation which never happened...

39:07.126 --> 39:10.289
...it was confirmed
that you were a double agent.

39:10.563 --> 39:13.031
See that "Sanction Authorization 1"?

39:15.034 --> 39:16.501
There's a contract out on me.

39:16.569 --> 39:17.968
- Correct.
- Why?

39:18.037 --> 39:21.495
I think the reporter found out something
she shouldn't. What'd she say?

39:21.740 --> 39:25.267
Someone talked to her about the mission.
I didn't want to hear about it.

39:25.344 --> 39:27.812
That's why ostriches die young.

39:27.880 --> 39:31.145
Whoever talked to her
has evidently decided to rectify his error.

39:31.684 --> 39:34.778
Who the hell can get into
this machine and put out a hit on me?

39:35.754 --> 39:38.416
Only the President, the Secretaries...

39:38.490 --> 39:41.550
...and a few
Undersecretaries of Defense and State.

39:41.827 --> 39:44.352
The directors of the FBI, the CIA...

39:44.830 --> 39:47.264
...the Chairman
of the National Security Council...

39:47.333 --> 39:49.824
...and the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

39:50.436 --> 39:52.301
Thank God it's nobody important.

39:54.139 --> 39:56.334
Jesus, this is crazy.

39:57.710 --> 39:59.610
It's not just you, John.

40:00.813 --> 40:05.182
I had reason to check out all five of those
guys who came out of that jungle with you.

40:05.250 --> 40:09.687
Holly Washington is dead.
I think Lou Goldberg is, too.

40:11.991 --> 40:13.754
- Was it your people?
- I don't know.

40:14.159 --> 40:15.524
Well, find out.

40:16.528 --> 40:20.294
Look, first I get a tip on Holly and Lou.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.902
Then I meet a girl who knows more about
that goddamn raid than anyone should.

40:24.970 --> 40:27.962
Then there's the fact that
I'm the one that sent you on it.

40:28.207 --> 40:30.801
It isn't on that computer,
but it's a good bet...

40:30.876 --> 40:33.640
...that my name is there
with the rest of the Tigers.

40:34.046 --> 40:37.038
- Can't you warn them? Protect them?
- You can.

40:40.386 --> 40:42.684
Last known names and addresses.

40:46.625 --> 40:48.149
Mhin Van Thieu?

40:48.827 --> 40:50.658
What is his name doing on here?

40:52.564 --> 40:54.225
He was killed on that last raid.

40:55.367 --> 40:56.493
Evidently not.

40:57.069 --> 41:00.232
First listed as MIA, then POW...

41:00.305 --> 41:02.239
...released at the end of the war.

41:02.608 --> 41:05.736
We obviously paid him off
by bringing him into this country.

41:05.811 --> 41:09.508
He's cooking for some Peking-style
restaurant in San Francisco...

41:09.581 --> 41:11.879
...specializing in fried dumplings.

41:11.950 --> 41:15.977
That's great. What else do you know
that you may have forgotten to tell me?

41:18.590 --> 41:22.082
There is something,
but I just can't remember what it is.

41:22.561 --> 41:24.085
That helps a hell of a lot.

41:24.163 --> 41:27.155
Look, John,
there's a lot I can't help you with.

41:27.533 --> 41:29.763
The company has too many eyes.

41:30.836 --> 41:33.361
So you're going to have to
warn those guys yourself.

41:34.573 --> 41:36.973
This is my life
you're screwing with, Murray.

41:37.109 --> 41:38.974
It's mine too, friend.

42:44.042 --> 42:45.031
<i>Hello?</i>

42:45.110 --> 42:47.237
<i>- Gordie Jones, please.</i>
<i>- He's not home.</i>

42:47.479 --> 42:50.846
<i>- Where is he?</i>
<i>- At his Uncle Sheffield's Travel Town.</i>

42:51.250 --> 42:53.047
<i>Can I call him there?</i>

42:53.485 --> 42:55.612
<i>He ain't got no phone there.</i>

42:56.255 --> 42:59.247
<i>God, we don't owe you any money,</i>
<i>do we, mister?</i>

42:59.925 --> 43:02.553
<i>Look, you can find him at his uncle's.</i>

43:13.605 --> 43:16.972
<i>In Washington, Secretary</i>
<i>of State-Designate, Conrad Morgan...</i>

43:17.042 --> 43:20.603
<i>... goes before his final Senate</i>
<i>subcommittee hearing this morning.</i>

43:20.679 --> 43:24.547
<i>Morgan's approval by the committee</i>
<i>is virtually certain. At 41...</i>

43:56.181 --> 43:58.843
- Good morning.
- Is Gordie Jones here?

43:59.918 --> 44:01.283
All aboard!

44:27.913 --> 44:28.937
Hey, Gordie!

44:29.014 --> 44:32.381
Hey, Sammy! How ya doin'?
Not much business today.

44:32.618 --> 44:35.610
- You doin' any?
- No, business isn't too good.

44:35.988 --> 44:38.320
It's Maj. Booker, Gordie. John T. Booker.

44:39.191 --> 44:42.319
I thought you were Sammy.
You look just like Sammy.

44:42.794 --> 44:44.819
Has anyone been to see you recently?

44:44.897 --> 44:47.092
Has anyone asked you about
that last mission?

44:47.165 --> 44:49.895
What I wish we had is pelicans
instead of seagulls.

44:49.968 --> 44:51.799
Who asked you about the last mission?

44:51.870 --> 44:55.465
Just yesterday. A lady. Maybe today.
I told her about the pelicans.

44:55.741 --> 44:57.038
How was the halibut?

45:04.583 --> 45:05.914
Who the hell are you?

45:05.984 --> 45:07.781
That's the lady, Major.

45:19.731 --> 45:20.857
<i>Where are we going?</i>

45:20.933 --> 45:23.925
<i>Skiing. Maybe we can get to Mike Potter</i>
<i>before they do.</i>

45:24.002 --> 45:25.560
<i>But I've got a rental car.</i>

45:25.637 --> 45:27.571
<i>You're on an e</i> x <i>pense account.</i>
<i>Don't worry.</i>

45:27.639 --> 45:30.699
<i>- I don't have any ski clothes.</i>
<i>- We'll get something.</i>

45:45.323 --> 45:48.087
- Want some?
- No, thanks. Is it occupied?

45:48.493 --> 45:49.960
Go find out.

46:20.291 --> 46:22.020
Go to the bathroom.

46:22.894 --> 46:24.759
No. 1 or No. 2?

46:24.896 --> 46:28.832
The window seat, last row,
left side as you go down the aisle.

46:29.267 --> 46:31.895
An Oriental. See if you recognize him.

47:08.773 --> 47:12.903
Looks like a waiter in a Chinese restaurant
I used to frequent in Des Moines.

47:12.977 --> 47:16.071
I'll bet Chinese food in Des Moines
is something to remember.

47:16.147 --> 47:18.775
- Is he following us?
- I'm not sure yet.

47:19.617 --> 47:20.641
Maybe it's that waiter.

47:20.718 --> 47:23.812
I don't think I tipped him
last time I was there.

47:23.955 --> 47:27.516
Who did you talk to
at that cocktail party in Washington?

47:27.992 --> 47:31.894
Please don't ask. I'm almost certain I'll lie.

48:03.661 --> 48:05.185
Make a call.

48:07.265 --> 48:09.028
There's another one.

48:44.402 --> 48:46.029
So much for that.

49:09.394 --> 49:13.592
When you're silent, you're silent.
What are you thinking about?

49:14.899 --> 49:16.230
Old friends.

49:17.535 --> 49:18.797
Mhin.

49:20.038 --> 49:22.336
That guy on the plane was Mhin.

49:24.008 --> 49:25.737
Maj. Mhin Van Thieu?

49:27.211 --> 49:28.405
Another Black Tiger.

49:29.480 --> 49:33.075
What don't you know?
What did you talk to him about?

49:34.018 --> 49:36.179
I never said a word to him in my life.

49:36.254 --> 49:40.452
- What about Murray Saunders?
- I don't know any Murray Saunders.

49:40.692 --> 49:42.250
You were someone named Marilyn.

49:45.296 --> 49:46.593
That Murray Saunders.

49:46.664 --> 49:48.632
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

50:20.898 --> 50:23.025
Good evening. You got here just in time.

50:23.101 --> 50:25.592
- For what?
- The snow is melting fast.

50:25.670 --> 50:27.729
Is Mike Potter in? He's on the ski patrol.

50:27.805 --> 50:30.968
Mike? No, try his house. I'll dial it for you.

50:32.477 --> 50:34.911
Do you want to take it over there?

50:52.830 --> 50:55.663
- He's not in.
- Tomorrow's his day off. He's jump-crazy.

50:55.733 --> 50:58.827
He'll be on the jump
first thing in the morning.

50:59.937 --> 51:01.962
We better spend the night.

51:02.607 --> 51:04.438
- Do you have a room?
- I think so.

51:04.509 --> 51:06.443
Do you want to fill this out?

51:17.989 --> 51:20.924
To what extent
are we speaking to each other?

51:21.526 --> 51:23.551
What do you want to talk about?

51:23.661 --> 51:25.526
I was wondering, for instance...

51:25.596 --> 51:29.327
...if we're speaking enough
to share the only bed in the room.

51:29.400 --> 51:31.493
Sure, we can share the bed.

51:49.253 --> 51:50.948
Any enemies out there?

51:51.022 --> 51:53.456
I'm just as worried
about the enemy within.

51:54.725 --> 51:57.353
- Are you an enemy, Margaret?
- No.

51:58.129 --> 52:01.223
You just happened to be there
when Gordie was killed today.

52:01.299 --> 52:04.200
- Were you there when Lou and Holly died?
- No.

52:06.737 --> 52:10.264
Are you some kind of finger-man
for whoever's doing this?

52:16.481 --> 52:18.312
Finger-person.

52:24.522 --> 52:26.615
John, I haven't lied to you.

52:27.458 --> 52:29.255
Including last night?

52:30.194 --> 52:31.718
Especially last night.

52:33.097 --> 52:34.894
You fit in somewhere.

52:42.139 --> 52:43.470
So do you.

52:45.376 --> 52:47.970
<i>Mr. Morgan, I want to thank you</i>
<i>for the cooperation...</i>

52:48.045 --> 52:50.980
<i>... you're affording this committee</i>
<i>by your appearance here.</i>

52:51.048 --> 52:52.447
<i>Thank you, Senator.</i>

52:52.517 --> 52:55.680
<i>And I want to assure you</i>
<i>and the other members of the committee...</i>

52:55.753 --> 52:59.746
<i>... that I fully understand the necessity</i>
<i>for hearings such as these.</i>

52:59.824 --> 53:03.590
<i>And I want you all to feel free</i>
<i>to probe into any areas at all...</i>

53:03.661 --> 53:05.288
<i>... that might be of interest to you.</i>

53:05.363 --> 53:07.831
<i>I'm sure I can speak</i>
<i>for the entire committee...</i>

53:07.899 --> 53:11.494
<i>... when I say, sir, that such an attitude</i>
<i>is deeply appreciated.</i>

53:11.636 --> 53:12.830
<i>Because we've had to deal...</i>

53:12.904 --> 53:15.168
- Think he'll make it?
- Morgan?

53:15.473 --> 53:17.498
- Yeah.
- Yes.

53:17.575 --> 53:20.066
He's the new darling of Washington.

53:21.746 --> 53:25.204
<i>The attitude of the nation today is</i>
<i>far different from what it was...</i>

53:25.283 --> 53:27.444
<i>... in those early days before Vietnam.</i>

53:27.518 --> 53:30.885
<i>I think the American public today</i>
<i>is far less eager...</i>

53:30.955 --> 53:32.855
We'd better get going.

54:08.325 --> 54:11.988
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>and welcome to Squaw Valley, USA.</i>

54:12.395 --> 54:16.525
<i>After being selected as the site</i>
<i>of the 1960 Winter Olympic Games...</i>

54:16.600 --> 54:18.966
<i>... the Squaw Valley Comple</i> x
<i>was developed...</i>

54:19.035 --> 54:23.529
<i>... into one of the world's greatest ski areas</i>
<i>at a cost of over $25 million.</i>

54:24.374 --> 54:26.535
<i>You are now standing</i>
<i>in the lower terminal...</i>

54:26.610 --> 54:29.704
<i>... of one of the world's most spectacular</i>
<i>aerial tramways.</i>

54:29.780 --> 54:34.149
<i>The terminal alone cost</i>
<i>over $3.5 million in 1960 dollars.</i>

55:35.779 --> 55:38.771
<i>What snow we had this year</i>
<i>is now melting rapidly.</i>

55:38.849 --> 55:42.615
<i>So as we approach the top station,</i>
<i>we advise you to hurry out to the slopes...</i>

55:42.686 --> 55:44.551
<i>... and make the most of what's left.</i>

55:44.621 --> 55:46.748
<i>On behalf of Squaw Valley, USA...</i>

55:46.823 --> 55:50.088
<i>... I'd like to thank you for joining us,</i>
<i>and have a happy day.</i>

56:42.646 --> 56:45.479
- I'm looking for Mike Potter.
- You got him.

56:47.851 --> 56:49.011
Major?

56:50.487 --> 56:53.285
- What are you doing up here?
- Didn't you get my message?

56:53.890 --> 56:56.120
You mean the Code Red?
I thought that was a gag.

56:56.192 --> 56:57.420
Mike, you're up.

56:58.028 --> 57:00.758
Let's go in the shack. We've gotta talk.

57:02.832 --> 57:05.733
Meet me at the bottom.
Bring these with you.

57:06.536 --> 57:07.730
Mike, wait.

57:26.623 --> 57:27.783
Oh, Jesus!

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.454
Jesus Christ, I thought I'd never find you.

01:00:19.529 --> 01:00:22.191
There were cops
all over the place up there.

01:00:22.265 --> 01:00:25.428
I've got your clothes.
You can change in the car.

01:00:25.602 --> 01:00:26.762
Are you all right?

01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:31.538
- It was Mhin, wasn't it?
- The woman he met at the airport.

01:00:33.276 --> 01:00:34.709
I'm sorry about Mike.

01:00:35.078 --> 01:00:37.171
But you were right on the scene again.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.979
I'm not the enemy, John.
I told you that last night.

01:00:42.418 --> 01:00:45.182
- I think we better talk.
- Tell me!

01:00:51.461 --> 01:00:52.985
Edgar Harolds.

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:57.295
- Childhood sweetheart?
- A drunk at a cocktail party.

01:00:57.367 --> 01:00:59.927
- Who is he?
- Undersecretary of State.

01:01:00.003 --> 01:01:03.336
A career man at the end of his career,
maybe the end of his rope.

01:01:03.406 --> 01:01:05.306
Goddamn it, who are you?

01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:10.441
Edgar Harolds worked for Conrad Morgan
during the Vietnam War and he hates him.

01:01:10.747 --> 01:01:12.510
Morgan on the TV?

01:01:12.715 --> 01:01:16.879
The Senate does more than question a man
who's nominated for Secretary of State.

01:01:16.953 --> 01:01:19.854
Before Watergate,
it was generally a formality.

01:01:19.923 --> 01:01:24.860
Now, they do a pretty thorough job of it.
They even hire attorneys to investigate.

01:01:25.128 --> 01:01:29.155
- What does that have to do with you?
- It's actually pretty funny.

01:01:29.766 --> 01:01:33.031
I was invited to a cocktail party
by the head of the committee.

01:01:33.102 --> 01:01:36.560
Just a social event.
I had barely started to work for him.

01:01:36.639 --> 01:01:38.698
You're a lawyer? An investigator?

01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:40.901
I'd been standing for hours...

01:01:40.977 --> 01:01:43.775
...when I noticed this man
sitting all alone at a table.

01:01:43.846 --> 01:01:47.873
He looked pleasantly drunk and harmless.
I went over and sat with him.

01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:50.146
- Is Morgan mixed up in this?
- I don't know.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.189
Harolds never mentioned him,
but it seems there's a connection.

01:01:53.323 --> 01:01:55.518
The papers keep saying
his approval is assured.

01:01:55.592 --> 01:01:59.221
- How, if you told the committee...
- I never told the committee anything!

01:01:59.295 --> 01:02:00.853
You don't survive in Washington...

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:04.491
...by attacking men like Morgan
without substantial facts.

01:02:04.567 --> 01:02:07.866
I just said I wanted to follow up
on some leads and they said, "Go."

01:02:07.937 --> 01:02:09.802
- They know nothing about this?
- Not yet.

01:02:09.872 --> 01:02:12.807
That's why we'll take the first plane east.

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:15.537
That may take days.
I have to get to Joe Walker in Mexico.

01:02:15.612 --> 01:02:18.274
- He's the only man left.
- You're left.

01:02:18.815 --> 01:02:21.010
And I want you to stay alive...

01:02:21.851 --> 01:02:23.648
...for personal reasons.

01:02:25.255 --> 01:02:27.120
Do you believe me now?

01:02:35.864 --> 01:02:37.855
<i>Your attention, please:</i>

01:02:37.966 --> 01:02:42.801
<i>Will all passengers holding tickets for</i>
<i>Intermountain Flight 184...</i>

01:02:43.004 --> 01:02:46.997
<i>... please contact the agent</i>
<i>at the Intermountain ticket counter.</i>

01:02:51.113 --> 01:02:54.446
Is there any space on 322
to San Francisco and Washington?

01:02:54.749 --> 01:02:56.808
Yes, ma'am. Round trip or one-way?

01:02:56.918 --> 01:02:58.647
- One way.
- Round trip.

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:01.713
You'll need it, back to LA.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:04.619
You heard the man.

01:03:05.227 --> 01:03:07.661
Make mine one-way to LA. Next flight out.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:13.532
<i>Final call:</i>

01:03:13.668 --> 01:03:17.263
<i>Flight 2, now boarding at Gate No. 21.</i>

01:03:26.114 --> 01:03:28.912
- How about a farewell cup of coffee?
- Why not?

01:03:28.984 --> 01:03:32.010
You better hurry.
They're beginning to board.

01:03:32.254 --> 01:03:33.915
Have a good flight.

01:04:02.117 --> 01:04:05.018
I'll do my damnedest
to get them to delay the confirmation...

01:04:05.086 --> 01:04:08.283
...but I'm gonna need you there to stop it,
if Harolds'll talk.

01:04:08.356 --> 01:04:10.449
I'll be there day after tomorrow.

01:04:10.525 --> 01:04:14.552
<i>Flight 62, now boarding at Gate 21.</i>

01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:16.094
That's me.

01:04:16.631 --> 01:04:19.657
- You gonna wave goodbye?
- I have to turn in the rental car.

01:04:19.734 --> 01:04:22.703
Oh, God, I left one
with the meter running in San Diego!

01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:26.764
The committee will love you.
They can ask for a bigger car rental budget.

01:04:26.841 --> 01:04:29.002
Don't worry about us taxpayers.

01:04:29.077 --> 01:04:30.135
Bye.

01:05:22.264 --> 01:05:26.291
Collect call, please.
John T. Booker calling Murray Saunders.

01:06:22.691 --> 01:06:26.650
<i>The emergency over the runway</i>
<i>is causing no danger to the terminal area.</i>

01:06:27.462 --> 01:06:29.293
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

01:06:29.764 --> 01:06:32.927
<i>All persons in the terminal area</i>
<i>are asked to clear all gates...</i>

01:06:33.001 --> 01:06:35.697
<i>... and entrances to the field</i>
<i>so emergency workers...</i>

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:38.238
<i>...and equipment can get through.</i>
- Hold it!

01:06:38.306 --> 01:06:41.537
<i>Obey the commands of the airport guards</i>
<i>and police officers...</i>

01:06:41.609 --> 01:06:45.841
<i>... so that rescue workers may perform</i>
<i>their duties as efficiently as possible.</i>

01:06:45.914 --> 01:06:49.247
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>there is no danger to the terminal area.</i>

01:06:50.085 --> 01:06:52.178
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

01:07:27.522 --> 01:07:29.922
What are you doing with that gun?

01:08:49.636 --> 01:08:50.865
Harolds!

01:08:52.607 --> 01:08:55.508
Jesus Christ, I should have figured it out.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:58.741
In Paris.

01:09:01.983 --> 01:09:04.109
It was a setup all the way.

01:09:05.353 --> 01:09:08.447
That's what Harolds
was trying to tell Margaret.

01:09:12.227 --> 01:09:14.718
John, are you okay?

01:09:15.395 --> 01:09:16.863
Yeah, thanks.

01:09:18.265 --> 01:09:21.429
She wanted me to talk to him
and get the proof we need.

01:09:21.536 --> 01:09:25.768
I think our next stop is Washington.
Are you sure you've got Walker covered?

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:29.899
I still can't figure out
why they suddenly decide to kill us all off.

01:09:29.978 --> 01:09:33.072
Maybe Morgan found out
that Harolds was about to crack.

01:09:33.147 --> 01:09:35.171
Why didn't he arrange an accident
for Harolds?

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:38.617
Five'll get you ten
there's a damn good reason he didn't.

01:09:38.685 --> 01:09:40.313
Let's go ask him.

01:09:53.535 --> 01:09:54.797
Morning.

01:09:55.303 --> 01:09:58.966
- May I help you gentlemen?
- Yes, Mr. Harolds' apartment, please.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.441
- May I have your name?
- We want to surprise him.

01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:05.877
I'm afraid we're not allowed
to surprise our tenants.

01:10:07.015 --> 01:10:11.145
Even if you were J. Edgar Hoover himself,
I couldn't allow you upstairs.

01:10:11.219 --> 01:10:14.052
It's not likely he could be Mr. Hoover
if he wanted to.

01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:17.580
Not only is he the wrong color,
but Mr. Hoover is dead.

01:10:18.059 --> 01:10:19.822
I'm sure you get my meaning.

01:10:20.261 --> 01:10:21.785
Yes, we do.

01:10:22.163 --> 01:10:24.859
We want to make sure
you get what we mean.

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:27.629
You see, my friend here is very cranky.

01:10:27.769 --> 01:10:30.704
In fact,
I'd say he's on the very edge of anger.

01:10:31.172 --> 01:10:35.734
And in about five seconds,
I'm going to ask him to kick your teeth in...

01:10:35.843 --> 01:10:39.438
...if you don't show us the way
to Mr. Harolds' apartment.

01:10:43.484 --> 01:10:46.521
Very well. Follow me.

01:10:47.889 --> 01:10:49.186
He must have good teeth.

01:10:58.232 --> 01:10:59.722
Remember what happened...

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.759
...the last time a Washington apartment
was broken into for political reasons.

01:11:03.838 --> 01:11:06.398
Think about it.
It altered the course of history.

01:11:06.474 --> 01:11:08.601
He will alter the course of your nose...

01:11:08.676 --> 01:11:10.871
...if you don't show us
where the apartment is.

01:11:10.945 --> 01:11:14.244
- lf you put it in that perspective...
- Now!

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.319
There it is.

01:11:20.588 --> 01:11:24.615
- Should we ring the buzzer or kick it in?
- No, I'll ring the bell.

01:11:31.165 --> 01:11:32.223
Yes?

01:11:32.533 --> 01:11:35.661
- Tell him it's you.
- It's me, Mr. Harolds.

01:11:36.938 --> 01:11:37.996
Who?

01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:40.104
Louder. Be more specific.

01:11:40.308 --> 01:11:43.505
Albert, the doorman.

01:11:44.812 --> 01:11:46.211
What do you want?

01:11:46.347 --> 01:11:49.316
- Package.
- I've got a package.

01:11:59.293 --> 01:12:03.662
- It's all right, Albert.
- Thank you. You've been quite civilized.

01:12:07.501 --> 01:12:09.059
Good morning, Mr. Harolds.

01:12:09.136 --> 01:12:12.435
"My vengeance is swift, saith the Lord."

01:12:12.607 --> 01:12:16.441
I expected it to be swift and very violent.

01:12:17.878 --> 01:12:20.005
I haven't been disappointed.

01:12:21.048 --> 01:12:24.745
Since the day you walked out of
that hotel room in Paris...

01:12:24.986 --> 01:12:28.285
...l've been wondering
if I might not see you again.

01:12:28.556 --> 01:12:33.516
The fact that you are here now
is testimony to your powers of survival.

01:12:34.228 --> 01:12:36.423
The test is not over yet.

01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:38.725
I'd like you to meet John Booker.

01:12:38.933 --> 01:12:42.528
Maj. Booker,
the shepherd of the betrayed flock.

01:12:42.737 --> 01:12:45.331
That's what we're here to talk about.

01:12:45.506 --> 01:12:49.875
Normally, I'd do what I've done
all the years I've served my country...

01:12:50.144 --> 01:12:52.442
...and feed you a line of shit.

01:12:53.948 --> 01:12:56.178
But I don't think I'll bother.

01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:59.151
Perhaps you're doing me a favor.

01:13:01.022 --> 01:13:03.547
No, Major, there's no one else here.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.697
My wife and children had the good sense
to go on about their own lives years ago.

01:13:11.499 --> 01:13:15.299
- Do you have a family, Major?
- I had plans, but they didn't work out.

01:13:19.173 --> 01:13:21.437
Then perhaps you're fortunate.

01:13:24.578 --> 01:13:26.443
So this is what I get...

01:13:27.248 --> 01:13:31.742
...for having too much to drink
and finding a receptive ear.

01:13:33.254 --> 01:13:37.088
Can you imagine a career diplomat
getting drunk and babbling...

01:13:37.158 --> 01:13:39.592
...at a Washington cocktail party?

01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:45.061
You don't get to be an old-timer here
without learning not to do that...

01:13:45.766 --> 01:13:47.893
...unless you're over the hill.

01:13:49.804 --> 01:13:53.103
An interesting phrase, "over the hill."

01:13:53.841 --> 01:13:58.175
Conrad has been telling me for years,
that's where I am.

01:13:59.346 --> 01:14:01.439
He's a brilliant man, Conrad.

01:14:02.349 --> 01:14:05.716
Most of us think we know
what we want out of life.

01:14:06.554 --> 01:14:11.082
But Conrad is one of those few
who knows how to get it.

01:14:11.826 --> 01:14:15.762
Of course, he learned immediately
of my drunken indiscretion.

01:14:16.464 --> 01:14:21.265
The captured indiscreet remark
is a source of power in Washington...

01:14:21.335 --> 01:14:23.667
...a lesson Conrad learned well.

01:14:25.906 --> 01:14:29.103
I may have been the one
who first taught him that.

01:14:29.577 --> 01:14:32.239
Perhaps I am over the hill.

01:14:33.981 --> 01:14:38.008
And she is a brilliant young woman,
quite lovely.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:44.121
There was something about her.
I just wanted to talk to her.

01:14:44.892 --> 01:14:47.952
But, of course,
you must know that by now, Major.

01:14:48.963 --> 01:14:52.490
Your being the leader of the Black Tigers...

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.860
...I assume she must have gone
directly to you.

01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:58.700
Of course,
Morgan assumed the same thing.

01:14:59.106 --> 01:15:02.906
His efforts to find out
just how much you knew...

01:15:02.977 --> 01:15:06.777
...and whom you might have told
have probably kept you alive.

01:15:07.348 --> 01:15:10.340
Four of the men who came back with me
weren't as lucky.

01:15:12.653 --> 01:15:15.850
My condolences, of course,
will seem meaningless.

01:15:17.424 --> 01:15:19.756
I was there in the beginning...

01:15:20.427 --> 01:15:23.863
...when they invented
the Phoenix Operation.

01:15:23.931 --> 01:15:27.867
Do you know what everyone
was most upset about?

01:15:28.369 --> 01:15:33.033
Not the idea that we were
consciously structuring a group of men...

01:15:33.107 --> 01:15:36.907
...whose purpose was
the clandestine murder of other men.

01:15:38.512 --> 01:15:43.074
Not the moral ramifications
that might befall us in another life...

01:15:43.884 --> 01:15:47.479
...for the decision
based on political expediency.

01:15:49.223 --> 01:15:53.250
What we got most embroiled in
was an argument over what...

01:15:53.327 --> 01:15:55.887
...a particular group of assassins...

01:15:55.963 --> 01:15:59.126
...we decided to call the Black Tigers...

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.226
...what that group of assassins
would wear...

01:16:02.336 --> 01:16:07.035
...when they went out to relieve
selected individuals of their very lives.

01:16:08.008 --> 01:16:12.035
Finally, after a great deal
of bitter argument...

01:16:12.613 --> 01:16:17.209
...we determined
to dress the Black Tigers in all black.

01:16:18.018 --> 01:16:22.512
The commission was then paid to
a noted designer who shall be nameless...

01:16:22.957 --> 01:16:27.951
...who designed the black clothing
the Black Tigers wore as they rolled out...

01:16:28.028 --> 01:16:30.189
<i>... on their holy crusades.</i>

01:16:30.531 --> 01:16:32.658
<i>You made quite a reputation</i>
<i>for yourselves.</i>

01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:39.098
Mr. Morgan?
Mr. Harolds has some visitors.

01:16:40.641 --> 01:16:41.972
No, sir, I'm not sure.

01:16:42.042 --> 01:16:46.240
I think one of them is Murray Saunders
from the Los Angeles office.

01:16:47.548 --> 01:16:49.345
You want them stopped?

01:16:50.184 --> 01:16:52.812
Right, and a man on Harolds.
You've got it.

01:16:57.091 --> 01:16:58.115
We were set up.

01:16:59.126 --> 01:17:00.354
Yes.

01:17:00.694 --> 01:17:02.355
What was the deal?

01:17:02.696 --> 01:17:07.224
When I was a younger man, I knew
I was going to be Secretary of State...

01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:09.496
...or perhaps even President.

01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:12.603
If I tell you the answer to that question...

01:17:13.807 --> 01:17:18.767
...I may not even be afforded
the opportunity to retire next year...

01:17:18.846 --> 01:17:21.906
...with the modicum of dignity left to me.

01:17:26.387 --> 01:17:28.355
But then, I suppose your life...

01:17:28.422 --> 01:17:31.789
...is not nearly so inconsequential to you...

01:17:31.859 --> 01:17:34.054
...as it is to Mr. Morgan...

01:17:34.628 --> 01:17:36.596
...or even to me.

01:17:43.704 --> 01:17:47.606
- I hope this letter's the answer.
- It's the best shot we've got.

01:18:13.767 --> 01:18:16.258
Okay, Saunders, I want that letter.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.045
Listen, Al.

01:18:28.315 --> 01:18:31.580
Somebody got into that computer
and this letter proves it.

01:18:32.519 --> 01:18:34.180
The letter, Murray.

01:18:36.623 --> 01:18:38.648
Come on.

01:18:44.631 --> 01:18:47.532
- Get the letter. I'll cover you.
- Watch out!

01:19:26.707 --> 01:19:29.175
- Enjoy the fight?
- Terrific.

01:20:18.859 --> 01:20:20.258
Here it is.

01:20:21.428 --> 01:20:23.692
Why would this guy live
halfway to Baltimore?

01:20:23.764 --> 01:20:27.325
Who knows? Maybe it has
something to do with Spiro Agnew.

01:20:27.401 --> 01:20:30.234
It wasn't very hard
to get an appointment with the big man.

01:20:30.304 --> 01:20:33.569
Morgan's very interested
in what he thinks we might have to sell.

01:20:44.284 --> 01:20:47.310
- Good morning, Saunders.
- Good morning, Morgan.

01:20:47.387 --> 01:20:49.355
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

01:20:49.423 --> 01:20:52.654
A gentleman whom I'm sure
will add to our discussion.

01:20:53.093 --> 01:20:54.253
I see.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.124
John T. Booker.

01:21:06.273 --> 01:21:11.108
Saunders, I trust this rather unusual
meeting is as important as you indicated.

01:21:11.445 --> 01:21:14.846
Something you said had to do with
our last rather unusual meeting...

01:21:14.915 --> 01:21:16.610
...in that Paris hotel room.

01:21:16.683 --> 01:21:20.141
Something, yes.
But with one notable addition.

01:21:21.822 --> 01:21:23.585
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

01:21:23.657 --> 01:21:27.149
Can we get on with it?
I have a rather busy day ahead of me.

01:21:27.227 --> 01:21:31.323
You made a deal in Paris with Kuong Yen,
the North Vietnamese negotiator.

01:21:31.398 --> 01:21:33.559
Secret deals are the heart of diplomacy.

01:21:33.967 --> 01:21:36.367
This deal called for
the murder of the Black Tigers.

01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:38.628
Murder, Mr. Booker?

01:21:39.406 --> 01:21:42.534
One other American knows about it
and he talked.

01:21:43.944 --> 01:21:45.138
Indeed?

01:21:45.245 --> 01:21:47.076
At first, I couldn't figure out...

01:21:47.147 --> 01:21:50.241
...why you didn't try to kill Harolds
along with the rest of us.

01:21:50.317 --> 01:21:51.682
He told me.

01:21:52.152 --> 01:21:56.282
He sent a registered letter to four lawyers,
none of whom you know.

01:21:57.024 --> 01:22:01.222
The letters were to be opened
in the event of his untimely death.

01:22:02.329 --> 01:22:03.660
Early Agatha Christie.

01:22:03.730 --> 01:22:05.288
And just as effective.

01:22:05.365 --> 01:22:09.597
The letters explain what was known by you
and Kuong Yen as the Phoenix Solution.

01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:13.538
I couldn't figure out what Maj. Mhin
was doing popping in and out of my life.

01:22:13.607 --> 01:22:16.906
At first, I assumed he worked for them,
whoever "they" were.

01:22:16.977 --> 01:22:21.505
But of course, "they" are you,
and you are all one.

01:22:21.748 --> 01:22:25.775
I see. "We have met the enemy
and they is us."

01:22:25.853 --> 01:22:27.753
Comic strip philosophy, Mr. Booker.

01:22:27.821 --> 01:22:30.654
Agreed, and now Kuong Yen
is manipulating you...

01:22:30.724 --> 01:22:33.284
...like the comic strip diplomat you are.

01:22:33.927 --> 01:22:37.328
He waited patiently until the moment
of your greatest vulnerability...

01:22:37.564 --> 01:22:40.829
...the eve of your confirmation
as Secretary of State.

01:22:41.101 --> 01:22:42.693
Now he's blackmailing you...

01:22:42.769 --> 01:22:45.829
...into completing the deal
you never finished...

01:22:46.506 --> 01:22:49.134
...the extermination of the Black Tigers.

01:22:49.643 --> 01:22:52.635
They are very unforgiving people.

01:22:52.779 --> 01:22:54.508
Toward you or the Black Tigers?

01:22:54.581 --> 01:22:58.847
- Toward us, Mr. Booker. "We" is us.
- Perhaps.

01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:12.159
Interesting document.

01:23:17.304 --> 01:23:20.603
Morgan, you're gonna pick up that phone
and call the White House.

01:23:20.674 --> 01:23:23.040
Sudden personal problems
are going to prevent you...

01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:26.568
...from accepting the nomination
as Secretary of State.

01:23:27.414 --> 01:23:30.474
If you don't,
the news media is going to have...

01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:32.780
...one hell of a time with that letter.

01:23:33.553 --> 01:23:37.546
I understand, Maj. Booker,
that you were quite a jungle fighter.

01:23:37.758 --> 01:23:39.692
This is my kind of jungle, Major.

01:23:42.596 --> 01:23:46.726
No, I just don't think it would be...

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.030
...expedient for me to resign at this time.

01:23:49.102 --> 01:23:50.433
Expedient?

01:23:50.637 --> 01:23:53.868
Just like it was expedient
to send us on that POW raid?

01:23:54.675 --> 01:23:57.576
Expedience built this country, Maj. Booker.

01:23:58.312 --> 01:24:03.272
It was expedient for this great democracy
to have legal slavery for half its existence.

01:24:04.051 --> 01:24:08.112
And it was expedient to keep the vote
from women for 150 years.

01:24:08.388 --> 01:24:12.484
Expedient to declare war on Spain
and Mexico and to invade Cambodia.

01:24:13.126 --> 01:24:16.857
From the halls of Montezuma,
Maj. Booker, to the shores of Tripoli...

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:20.366
And it was expedient, goddamn it,
to get rid of the Black Tigers.

01:24:21.668 --> 01:24:24.034
The end still justifies the means.

01:24:24.104 --> 01:24:25.833
I don't buy that.

01:24:26.573 --> 01:24:30.475
It occurs to me that most of those
who follow your logic end up in places...

01:24:30.544 --> 01:24:32.569
...like Elba and San Clemente.

01:24:32.713 --> 01:24:33.805
Come now...

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.507
Check your history.

01:24:35.582 --> 01:24:38.710
Most of our expedient wars
ended up in failure.

01:24:38.852 --> 01:24:41.878
Our successes didn't just happen
because they were expedient.

01:24:41.955 --> 01:24:44.856
Those Americans you spoke of
gave up their lives willingly.

01:24:44.925 --> 01:24:46.984
Does that really make such a difference?

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.961
It makes all the goddamn difference.

01:24:51.398 --> 01:24:55.357
People like you never could see that
and maybe they never will.

01:24:57.371 --> 01:25:00.932
It's not that you don't deserve
to be Secretary of State.

01:25:02.009 --> 01:25:04.034
You don't deserve to live.

01:25:05.412 --> 01:25:08.040
That's an interesting philosophy, but...

01:25:08.115 --> 01:25:11.983
But philosophy is bullshit, right, Morgan?

01:25:14.254 --> 01:25:16.017
That letter isn't.

01:25:17.824 --> 01:25:19.485
I tell you what.

01:25:20.227 --> 01:25:24.095
You take this letter over to
the <i>Washington Post</i> with my best regards.

01:25:24.164 --> 01:25:27.827
But tell them they're gonna have
a hard time verifying that with Harolds...

01:25:27.901 --> 01:25:32.634
...because visitors are not allowed
in the Bethesda Hospital psychiatric ward.

01:25:36.276 --> 01:25:39.109
Yes, it was a shame.

01:25:39.179 --> 01:25:41.409
They found him crawling on the floor...

01:25:41.481 --> 01:25:44.473
...and howling like a banshee.

01:25:45.285 --> 01:25:49.381
Took four men just to put him
into the straitjacket.

01:25:49.923 --> 01:25:54.155
Nervous disorder, they called it,
but actually, he's quite mad.

01:25:54.294 --> 01:25:57.695
Hello? I'd like to check on
the condition of a...

01:25:57.764 --> 01:25:59.925
...Mr. Harolds, Edgar J.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:07.971
Thank you.

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.048
A letter written by a madman is...

01:26:16.116 --> 01:26:19.244
...hardly what they call prime evidence.

01:26:19.386 --> 01:26:20.853
Is it, Mr. Booker?

01:26:22.422 --> 01:26:25.084
As I told you,
I have a rather busy day ahead of me.

01:26:25.158 --> 01:26:29.219
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm sure you can find your own way out.

01:26:34.134 --> 01:26:36.227
By the way, Mr. Booker.

01:26:37.137 --> 01:26:40.766
Tragic news about your lady friend.
Margaret, was it?

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:44.837
All that information she had
must have been irreplaceable.

01:26:45.145 --> 01:26:46.134
Tragic.

01:26:46.213 --> 01:26:47.544
You bastard!

01:27:14.774 --> 01:27:16.264
Wait a minute.

01:27:25.986 --> 01:27:28.546
Accelerator pedal working all right today?

01:27:35.328 --> 01:27:36.886
Work for Morgan?

01:27:38.398 --> 01:27:39.592
Do you?

01:27:59.084 --> 01:28:01.712
<i>We're running a little late, Franklin.</i>

01:28:12.831 --> 01:28:16.790
<i>Secretary of State Morgan will become</i>
<i>one of the youngest men ever...</i>

01:28:16.868 --> 01:28:18.631
<i>... to achieve this high office.</i>

01:28:18.703 --> 01:28:22.230
<i>He's described as one of the new breed</i>
<i>of diplomats for the '70s.</i>

01:28:22.941 --> 01:28:25.466
<i>Although still in his early 40s...</i>

01:28:25.543 --> 01:28:28.478
<i>... Morgan has had</i>
<i>a long and distinguished career...</i>

01:28:28.546 --> 01:28:30.980
<i>... as one of America's leading diplomats.</i>

01:28:31.049 --> 01:28:33.882
<i>His skill at top-level negotiations</i>
<i>has made him...</i>

01:28:33.952 --> 01:28:36.944
<i>... one of the few</i>
<i>State Department leaders to...</i>

01:29:02.781 --> 01:29:04.976
<i>Franklin, where are we going?</i>

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:08.275
<i>I said, "Where are we going?"</i>

01:29:10.955 --> 01:29:12.752
What the hell is this?

01:29:13.291 --> 01:29:15.418
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

01:29:16.861 --> 01:29:18.055
Booker.

01:29:18.396 --> 01:29:21.058
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:29:21.132 --> 01:29:25.364
You said I was a good jungle fighter.
I'm also a fast learner.

01:29:42.387 --> 01:29:45.220
All right, now, you stop this car, you fool.

01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:48.020
Relax, Morgan, we're just going to talk.

01:29:50.695 --> 01:29:53.027
All right, go ahead. Talk!

01:29:53.865 --> 01:29:57.266
What you said about expedience
made a hell of a lot of sense.

01:29:57.502 --> 01:30:02.337
I see there's only one way to deal with
people like you: expediently.

01:30:02.941 --> 01:30:06.775
You won all the battles, Morgan,
but you're gonna lose this war.

01:30:07.078 --> 01:30:08.807
How would you like to be an MIA?

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.804
What're you talking about?

01:30:10.882 --> 01:30:15.319
When it comes time for your swearing in
today, you're not gonna be there.

01:30:16.354 --> 01:30:17.844
I'll be there.

01:30:18.523 --> 01:30:19.717
You're dreaming.

01:30:20.024 --> 01:30:21.013
Am I?

01:30:30.502 --> 01:30:33.562
Booker, they're going to come
looking for me.

01:30:33.972 --> 01:30:38.841
You can't just disappear a Secretary
of State without arousing someone's ire.

01:30:39.377 --> 01:30:40.469
Let 'em look.

01:30:40.845 --> 01:30:43.746
All right. Tell me, what's your plan?

01:30:44.015 --> 01:30:45.880
If you get away with this...

01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:49.977
...it'll betray every guy that ever died
in any war we ever had.

01:30:50.054 --> 01:30:54.013
And God knows how many more people
you'll kill in the future.

01:30:54.526 --> 01:30:56.653
I'm not gonna let it happen.

01:30:57.662 --> 01:30:59.892
You're insane. It won't work.

01:31:00.064 --> 01:31:01.588
You can bet your ass it will.

01:31:01.966 --> 01:31:04.059
Crazy, goddamn idiot!

01:31:04.335 --> 01:31:06.633
You stop this car! You hear me?

01:31:07.138 --> 01:31:10.232
Stop this car or I'll kill you!

01:31:10.808 --> 01:31:12.241
You're panicking.

01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:13.800
Stop the goddamn car!

01:32:34.826 --> 01:32:37.056
<i>The Greenpeace Foundation</i>
<i>in San Francisco...</i>

01:32:37.128 --> 01:32:39.790
<i>... says the Russians</i>
<i>are using 250-pound e</i> x <i>plosive...</i>

01:32:39.864 --> 01:32:41.161
Are you okay?

01:32:41.265 --> 01:32:43.631
<i>... which are against international treaties.</i>

01:32:43.701 --> 01:32:45.430
<i>In Washington, meantime...</i>

01:32:45.503 --> 01:32:47.994
<i>... the State Department</i>
<i>has an even bigger headache.</i>

01:32:48.072 --> 01:32:49.562
<i>Who will be its new boss?</i>

01:32:49.641 --> 01:32:51.941
<i>Morgan, due to be sworn in</i>
<i>this morning, suddenly...</i>

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:52.532
<i>Morgan, due to be sworn in</i>
<i>this morning, suddenly...</i>

01:32:52.608 --> 01:32:54.838
<i>...withdrew his name.</i>
- I'll give you a lift.

01:32:55.277 --> 01:32:57.973
<i>Morgan himself has been</i>
<i>unavailable for comment.</i>

01:32:58.047 --> 01:33:02.484
<i>He is said to be keeping a low profile</i>
<i>in a secret hideaway on Chesapeake Bay.</i>

01:33:03.152 --> 01:33:04.710
- In we go.
<i>- Also unavailable...</i>

01:33:04.787 --> 01:33:07.881
<i>... is Morgan's long-time deputy,</i>
<i>Edgar Harolds.</i>

01:33:08.023 --> 01:33:11.356
<i>It is speculated that Harolds</i>
<i>might now be nominated for the job...</i>

01:33:11.427 --> 01:33:14.123
<i>... but he is reportedly</i>
<i>in the Bethesda Naval Hospital...</i>

01:33:14.196 --> 01:33:17.188
<i>... undergoing his</i>
<i>annual physical e</i> x <i>amination.</i>

01:33:17.399 --> 01:33:20.129
<i>Morgan's withdrawal</i>
<i>came as a shock to most...</i>

01:33:20.202 --> 01:33:22.500
I see you've had a busy morning, too.

01:33:22.571 --> 01:33:25.199
Yeah, it was nothing like yours.
