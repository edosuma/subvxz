for Gentleman Jack ♪

1:00:29.768 --> 1:00:32.476
[bright tone]

1:00:34.100 --> 1:00:36.184
The Reverend Thomas Ainsworth
is at the door.

1:00:36.267 --> 1:00:38.643
You don't think he intends
to propose to you?

1:00:39.517 --> 1:00:42.017
So you shouldn't say anything
to Mr. Ainsworth.

1:00:42.100 --> 1:00:44.267
Miss Lister! The thing
you should understand--

1:00:44.351 --> 1:00:47.142
What you need to understand
is you would be exposed...

1:00:47.225 --> 1:00:48.309
as an adulterer.

1:00:48.517 --> 1:00:50.684
MAN: If she wants to start
running with the big dogs,

1:00:50.768 --> 1:00:52.225
then she's gonna have to
find out what it's like

1:00:52.309 --> 1:00:53.893
when they really start biting.

1:00:54.434 --> 1:00:56.267
You're in the worst kind
of danger,

1:00:56.351 --> 1:00:57.809
in this world and the next.

1:00:57.893 --> 1:01:00.559
ANNE LISTER: I would rather die
then people know what we do.

1:01:00.893 --> 1:01:02.392
It's wrong! It's repugnant!

1:01:02.975 --> 1:01:05.017
You understand nothing about me.
