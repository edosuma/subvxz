00:38.781 --> 00:40.441
Heads, you live.

00:41.743 --> 00:43.735
Tails, you die.

00:46.622 --> 00:49.708
Tails, you die.

00:51.249 --> 00:54.537
My name is Domino Harvey.

00:54.627 --> 00:56.916
I am a bounty hunter.

00:59.341 --> 01:01.299
What I say
over the next several hours

01:01.386 --> 01:04.672
will determine whether or not
I spend the rest of my life in prison.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.342
Tails, you die.

01:09.019 --> 01:10.928
Miss Harvey, my name is Taryn Mills.

01:11.021 --> 01:13.976
I'm a criminal psychologist
working for the FBI.

01:14.066 --> 01:16.272
I'm here to ask you
a few questions.

01:17.486 --> 01:18.399
Here's the part

01:18.487 --> 01:20.029
where I'm supposed
to get all defensive

01:20.114 --> 01:23.235
and say, "Not until
I speak with my attorney."

01:25.078 --> 01:26.905
I'll tell you everything I know.

01:29.249 --> 01:31.372
36 hours ago,
$10 million was stolen

01:31.460 --> 01:33.453
from an armoured car that
was subsequently found

01:33.545 --> 01:35.371
abandoned at the Hoover Dam.

01:42.556 --> 01:44.633
The driver's name was Locus Fender.

01:46.143 --> 01:48.681
We know that he was in on the heist.

01:48.771 --> 01:51.309
We know that
he was in on the heist.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.191
Is it true that you were hired

01:54.278 --> 01:56.270
to track down
and capture the thieves

01:56.363 --> 01:58.106
and then deliver them to Drake Bishop,

01:58.198 --> 02:00.357
owner of the Stratosphere
Hotel and Casino?

02:01.160 --> 02:02.619
Yes.

02:04.246 --> 02:05.076
You then learned

02:05.164 --> 02:07.120
where the thieves
had hidden the money.

02:08.709 --> 02:10.452
And at the instructions
of your employer,

02:10.544 --> 02:12.585
went to retrieve the money yourself.

02:13.423 --> 02:15.996
We were sent out
to the Fender Compound...

02:16.592 --> 02:18.632
in the desert near the chicken ranch.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.304
This way.

02:42.409 --> 02:44.283
All right, on my go.

02:45.205 --> 02:46.995
Watch your ass on this one.

02:47.873 --> 02:49.284
Go.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.643
Sic 'em, boy! Sic 'em!

03:15.613 --> 03:17.569
Fuck!

03:18.699 --> 03:20.526
Chi Chi?

03:22.078 --> 03:23.822
That's my best friend.

03:24.498 --> 03:26.952
His name is Choco.
He's always fancied me,

03:27.041 --> 03:29.711
but too shy to ever
do anything about it.

03:30.962 --> 03:32.754
Chi Chi!

03:33.965 --> 03:36.636
Edna, Chi Chi's in doggie hell.

03:37.887 --> 03:39.429
All we want is the money.

03:39.513 --> 03:40.794
That's Ed Moseby,

03:40.890 --> 03:43.761
the most legendary bounty hunter
in all of Los Angeles.

03:43.851 --> 03:46.225
He's my boss, my mentor,

03:46.314 --> 03:48.104
the father I never had.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.525
Chi Chi!

03:53.739 --> 03:56.194
My poor Chi Chi!

04:00.120 --> 04:02.409
The Manchurian Candidate,
eh, Edna?

04:03.707 --> 04:05.616
Is that you, Domino?

04:05.709 --> 04:07.618
Nice to see you, darling.

04:08.044 --> 04:10.414
Your father must be so proud

04:11.712 --> 04:14.001
of what's become of his little angel.

04:14.090 --> 04:15.750
Listen, bitch, we've got your son!

04:15.842 --> 04:18.462
If you don't give us the money,
we're gonna wax his fucking ass!

04:18.552 --> 04:20.379
You don’t have shit!

04:21.055 --> 04:22.430
Hey, Choco.

04:24.684 --> 04:26.477
Show her.

04:39.033 --> 04:41.073
He's still alive, Edna!

04:41.160 --> 04:43.035
Prove it!

04:43.122 --> 04:45.162
Choco, go get him.

05:01.433 --> 05:03.058
Last question for £20.

05:03.143 --> 05:05.385
Start the clock. Zack, in anatomy,

05:05.479 --> 05:07.972
a human being is usually
born with how many toes?

05:08.066 --> 05:09.857
We got to show Edna her son.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.284
That's our driver Alf.

05:19.370 --> 05:20.864
He's from Afghanistan.

05:21.664 --> 05:23.491
He once ate a cat.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.620
We can’t understand how to
pronounce his fucking name,

05:27.712 --> 05:30.333
so we just call him
the cat eating alien.

05:38.766 --> 05:40.224
What does that mean?

05:40.309 --> 05:42.136
Shut the fuck up.

06:16.345 --> 06:18.468
How did Locus Fender lose his arm?

06:22.100 --> 06:24.972
He had the combination
to the safe tattooed on it.

06:25.063 --> 06:26.807
Mama! Mama!

06:27.524 --> 06:29.019
Locus!

06:29.110 --> 06:30.390
Mama. Mama.

06:30.486 --> 06:32.194
Baby, I'm here!

06:32.279 --> 06:34.237
Please. Please.

06:35.575 --> 06:37.817
You got to do as I say.

06:38.286 --> 06:41.157
Now, the combination is on my arm.

06:42.666 --> 06:44.908
Mama, you got to get the decoder.

06:45.795 --> 06:47.503
Please, Mama.

06:48.297 --> 06:50.669
Put your weapon down!

06:51.842 --> 06:53.253
Put it down, Mama!

06:53.344 --> 06:54.921
Put your fucking weapon down!

07:17.663 --> 07:19.206
Time to start at the beginning.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.658
Time to start at the beginning.

07:23.335 --> 07:25.293
I'm the boss.

07:25.922 --> 07:29.257
I'm already a cool
motherfucker, you know?

07:29.343 --> 07:30.916
I employ bounty hunters.

07:31.007 --> 07:32.335
I'm here today to speak

07:32.425 --> 07:35.130
for all the women of
mixed race in America.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.548
I'm sorry?

07:37.764 --> 07:40.765
I will knock
you out! Number one!

07:44.688 --> 07:46.598
Where's my money?

07:48.318 --> 07:49.860
I fuckin' love that show.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.975
Maybe one of you will survive.

08:49.885 --> 08:51.463
Now, Mama!

08:53.389 --> 08:55.014
Put your fucking weapon down!

09:07.571 --> 09:10.522
You got 10 minutes
to open that safe, Edna.

09:11.322 --> 09:13.647
Fuck you!

09:15.368 --> 09:16.862
I've never killed anyone.

09:16.953 --> 09:21.283
I hope to never kill anyone,
even if they deserve it.

09:21.375 --> 09:25.621
My agenda is to kick ass
and secure the bounty.

09:25.712 --> 09:29.663
If I'm on this side of the law,
I can live the low life and avoid jail.

09:29.759 --> 09:33.543
I can live the nasty
and not do time for it.

09:33.846 --> 09:36.384
That's called
the best of both worlds.

09:36.474 --> 09:39.808
As for that other world,
that 90210 world,

09:39.894 --> 09:41.852
it's not for me.

09:48.738 --> 09:50.315
Is that him?

09:50.406 --> 09:52.364
Is that your dad?

09:52.450 --> 09:55.072
My real father was an actor.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.035
He died when I was a little girl.

09:57.122 --> 09:58.201
Hi, Ben.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.414
What the hell are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

10:00.502 --> 10:02.910
Heh. I knew Frank.

10:03.005 --> 10:04.628
Who didn't?

10:05.423 --> 10:07.380
Hey, Edna...

10:07.467 --> 10:09.460
You know what, sweetheart?
You got, like, 7 minutes

10:09.553 --> 10:11.842
to open that goddamn freezer,

10:11.930 --> 10:14.467
or I'm gonna flush that
fucking arm down the toilet.

10:14.557 --> 10:16.051
Fucker!

10:16.142 --> 10:18.183
You're probably
wondering how a girl like me

10:18.271 --> 10:20.762
arrived here, at the arse end
of the Nevada Desert

10:20.857 --> 10:24.521
with a blood-spattered Winnebago
and a one-armed man.

10:26.779 --> 10:30.445
The Department of
Motor Vehicles in Los Angeles.

10:31.826 --> 10:34.033
His name is Frances.

10:34.121 --> 10:36.993
Mr 90210 college boy
had found himself

10:37.083 --> 10:39.491
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.413
Hey, yeah, what's up?

10:41.505 --> 10:42.536
OK.

10:42.631 --> 10:45.999
Look, I said,

10:46.092 --> 10:48.880
they're about to call
my number, like, any second.

10:48.970 --> 10:51.293
Now, are you in, or are you out?

10:51.387 --> 10:55.680
OK. Make up your fucking mind, 'cause
they're about to call my number.

10:55.766 --> 11:00.345
Right now, 'cause they're about to call
my fucking number.

11:01.230 --> 11:03.104
All right.

11:03.191 --> 11:04.898
We're on.

11:13.577 --> 11:17.622
Now serving GO86.

11:17.707 --> 11:19.996
Hey...

11:22.337 --> 11:24.130
Kee Kee?

11:33.391 --> 11:36.641
Kee Kee said that
you could deliver the...

11:36.727 --> 11:39.645
the IDs tonight.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.890
Lateesha... I need that web link.

11:42.985 --> 11:45.772
The J Lo concert is
probably sold out already.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.161
Kee Kee don’t make the rules.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.111
Listen...

11:56.164 --> 11:58.124
bitch...

12:01.839 --> 12:05.374
I don't think you understand who
the fuck you're dealing with here.

12:06.427 --> 12:10.888
OK? Because I could make
your job disappear like that.

12:14.395 --> 12:16.720
Kee Kee said tonight.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.482
Tonight, 8pm.

12:31.034 --> 12:32.991
Anything else?

12:35.497 --> 12:37.453
Nope.

12:37.540 --> 12:39.581
Good-bye, Frances.

12:41.963 --> 12:44.288
Good-bye, Lateesha.

12:54.268 --> 12:55.928
Fuck 'em.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.722
Fuck ‘em all.

13:01.150 --> 13:03.273
Lateesha, Frances,
and the 4 fake IDs

13:03.360 --> 13:05.983
is where it all went wrong.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.196
Where's the money?

13:08.283 --> 13:10.157
I don't know.

13:15.416 --> 13:18.998
I think that you're lying. I think you know
exactly where the money is.

13:21.340 --> 13:24.092
I think you're trying to scare me
into falsely incriminating myself,

13:24.176 --> 13:26.086
and it's not going to work.

13:27.346 --> 13:31.807
This is your last chance. Once I walk
out that door, I can't help you.

13:36.606 --> 13:40.651
When I was a little girl, my
father told me that if you weren't careful,

13:40.735 --> 13:45.113
you could lose everything you've ever
earned in life in a split second.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.361
You have to know when to cash out.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.638
Thank you.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.218
He will wipe away
every tear from their eyes,

14:16.313 --> 14:17.972
and death will be no more.

14:18.064 --> 14:20.057
Neither will mourning nor outcry

14:20.149 --> 14:22.475
nor pain be any more.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.862
The former things have passed away.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.693
And, look...

14:28.784 --> 14:30.611
I am with you all the days

14:30.703 --> 14:33.906
until the conclusion
of the system of things.

14:44.928 --> 14:48.379
After Dad passed on, my
mum's agenda was to hit the town

14:48.473 --> 14:51.178
and find another husband
with a boatload of cash.

14:54.938 --> 14:57.097
Hello, Mr Stevens. How are you?

14:57.191 --> 15:00.191
- Good holidays?
- Absolutely. Thank you.

15:00.277 --> 15:03.481
Darling.
I love you, love you.

15:03.573 --> 15:06.527
- Bye. Got to go, got to go.
- Bye.

15:10.788 --> 15:13.280
She decided to sock me
and my goldfish Sammy away

15:13.375 --> 15:14.999
in boarding school.

15:19.965 --> 15:22.966
A week later, sammy died.

15:24.430 --> 15:27.099
It was a pivotal moment in my life.

15:27.183 --> 15:31.394
I decided to never invest too much
emotion in one thing.

15:34.773 --> 15:38.025
It's always a set-up
to the pain of losing them.

16:01.465 --> 16:03.505
God created me
in His image.

16:13.688 --> 16:16.179
I guess
he had a thing for models.

16:16.274 --> 16:18.231
I guess
he had a thing for models.

16:18.318 --> 16:21.567
Like most models,
I was bored with life.

16:21.654 --> 16:24.858
I hated everything and everyone.

16:30.330 --> 16:33.035
If you think America
is dirt bag central,

16:33.125 --> 16:36.874
clearly you've never been to the sleaze
nation of our Queen Mother.

16:41.550 --> 16:43.509
I hope all this
is not gonna change you.

16:43.595 --> 16:47.096
One thing we'd like to change, though...
You said Ian's name wrong.

16:47.184 --> 16:50.350
- Right, it's "eye-an".
- Ian Ziering, not "ee-an" Ziering.

16:50.436 --> 16:52.346
It's "eye-an", since birth.

16:52.438 --> 16:55.642
Brilliant... Absolutely brilliant.

16:56.193 --> 16:59.029
Mum was determined
to move us to Beverly Hills.

16:59.113 --> 17:01.319
That damn show started it all.

17:01.407 --> 17:03.863
That damn show
started it all.

17:07.372 --> 17:10.954
She remarried to a man
named Mark Waldman.

17:12.251 --> 17:15.372
He invested in a restaurant
called the Hard Rock Cafe.

17:17.258 --> 17:20.922
Domino, Domino, give the goddamn
num chucks a rest already.

17:21.011 --> 17:23.087
It's time for supper. Come on, baby.

17:23.180 --> 17:25.753
I tried
Beverly Hills High for a spell,

17:25.849 --> 17:27.808
but it didn't work out.

17:27.895 --> 17:31.057
I hated them. I hated them all.

17:31.143 --> 17:34.478
5, 6, 7, 8!
We are Alpha Omega

17:34.565 --> 17:36.558
we are the AOPs...

17:36.650 --> 17:40.316
College was even worse.
Mum convinced me to join a sorority.

17:40.405 --> 17:42.646
It was all fun and games at first.

17:42.739 --> 17:44.531
Then the hazing started.

17:51.416 --> 17:54.702
This is fucking disgusting!

17:54.795 --> 17:57.630
Disgusting!

18:02.886 --> 18:05.972
Look at these mosquito bites.

18:08.478 --> 18:11.763
What's it like to have the body
of a 10-year-old boy?

18:15.526 --> 18:18.314
- Have you had a nose job?
- No.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.458
A week later, I was expelled.

18:32.127 --> 18:35.461
In the end,
it all came down to fate...

18:36.882 --> 18:40.716
An LA Weekly advert
strewn across the ground.

18:44.766 --> 18:47.388
Claremont Williams III...

18:47.477 --> 18:51.097
- Yeah!
- The legendary bail bondsman.

19:15.338 --> 19:18.588
I'm here for
the bounty hunter seminar.

19:24.681 --> 19:26.673
Cash?

19:31.899 --> 19:34.021
Keep the change.

19:42.535 --> 19:44.112
See, as a bail bondsman,

19:44.202 --> 19:47.489
I'm the go-between for
the court and the accused.

19:47.582 --> 19:49.326
For a 10% fee,

19:49.418 --> 19:52.288
I will guarantee the amount
set by the court.

19:52.379 --> 19:53.789
Now...

19:53.880 --> 19:56.549
if the defendant should fail to appear

19:56.633 --> 19:58.542
at his or her court date,

19:58.635 --> 20:03.097
I will bring in a bounty hunter
to recapture the defendant,

20:03.183 --> 20:06.883
or I will face having to repay
the court costs myself,

20:06.978 --> 20:11.058
which... we can't do.

20:13.027 --> 20:16.111
Now, this occurs most...

20:19.618 --> 20:22.405
frequently when the collateral

20:22.496 --> 20:25.413
or the guarantee
given to the bondsman

20:25.498 --> 20:30.790
turns out to be worthless
or difficult to liquidate.

20:31.422 --> 20:35.004
So... in layman's terms,

20:35.091 --> 20:38.758
we get 10% of the bail.

20:38.847 --> 20:41.848
Now, in the next few moments,

20:41.933 --> 20:45.218
Ed Moseby will take the podium,
and he will begin the seminar

20:45.311 --> 20:47.387
on how to become a bounty hunter.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.680
In the meantime, feel free to take
a coffee break, pee break, whatever.

20:50.772 --> 20:53.443
We'll be starting
in the next few minutes.

20:55.820 --> 21:00.364
Hey, how about it? Want to ride
some bounty hunter cock?

21:00.450 --> 21:04.069
- Fuck you, dickhead.
- Bitch!

21:04.163 --> 21:06.914
Excuse the fuck out of us!

21:15.257 --> 21:17.334
We got to ditch this thing.

21:18.970 --> 21:20.963
Gentlemen...

21:21.055 --> 21:23.428
it has been a pleasure.

21:24.892 --> 21:28.559
All right, bathroom window, 5minutes.

21:28.647 --> 21:30.854
I'll keep the engine running.

21:40.452 --> 21:42.860
Nobody really knows
where Ed came from.

21:42.955 --> 21:45.707
This much is clear...
the man's been places,

21:45.791 --> 21:48.627
seen things, lived life.

21:48.711 --> 21:51.285
He did a term in Soledad
and a term in Angola,

21:51.381 --> 21:54.335
where he lost a toe during a prison riot.

21:54.426 --> 21:56.916
The man's a warrior.

22:15.907 --> 22:18.400
To say that Choco is
the product of a broken home

22:18.495 --> 22:21.068
is to presume a home existed
in the first place.

22:21.164 --> 22:25.114
No. Choco never had a home.
Well, not unless you count

22:25.210 --> 22:27.036
10 or so juvenile
correction facilities,

22:27.128 --> 22:29.121
where he spent his childhood.

22:36.384 --> 22:38.377
Mierda! Damn!

22:41.891 --> 22:43.682
Goddamn!

22:45.061 --> 22:47.218
Puta...

22:47.312 --> 22:50.564
- What the fuck is this?
- Where the fuck are you going?

22:50.650 --> 22:53.189
Those people paid for a seminar!

22:54.822 --> 22:56.613
Where do you get off
fucking up my windshield?

22:56.699 --> 22:59.404
I want a job!

23:02.539 --> 23:04.911
Jesus fuckin' Christ, lady.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.538
Everybody wants a goddamn job.

23:08.462 --> 23:11.748
What makes you think you
can do this one?

23:15.011 --> 23:17.584
I've been training since I was 12.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.922
Knives, guns, throwing stars.

23:20.015 --> 23:23.599
You name it, I can fight with it.
I'm a hard worker. I'm a hard worker.

23:23.686 --> 23:28.147
I'm fast to learn, and nothing scares me.
I'm not afraid to die.

23:33.405 --> 23:35.529
Why would a...

23:35.616 --> 23:40.195
delicate little thing like you
want to be a goddamn bounty hunter?

23:41.207 --> 23:43.994
I want to have a little fun.

23:47.546 --> 23:49.872
You want to have a little fun?

23:53.469 --> 23:56.175
Well, little girl, you want a job?

23:56.264 --> 23:58.056
Yeah.

23:58.976 --> 24:00.719
It's gonna cost you a new windshield.

24:00.811 --> 24:04.311
You know what? Enough of that
"little girl" shit. The name is Domino.

24:05.233 --> 24:07.190
Domino.

24:07.734 --> 24:11.147
- Domino what?
- No, just Domino.

24:11.276 --> 24:13.435
Let's take a ride.

24:13.529 --> 24:14.561
Qué?

24:28.003 --> 24:31.420
The kid's name is Hector Maldonado,
19 years old.

24:31.967 --> 24:36.510
His mother posted bail for him,
after he was arrested for a drive-by.

24:40.100 --> 24:43.137
He speaks perfect fuckin' English.
He just thinks it's cute

24:43.228 --> 24:45.767
when he's around
a good-looking woman.

24:55.617 --> 24:58.025
Hey. Yeah, listen.

24:58.120 --> 25:01.821
Louise, listen,
you can make this easy,

25:01.916 --> 25:04.373
or you can make it real complicated.

25:05.462 --> 25:08.298
For $200, Louise gave us
her boyfriend's whereabouts

25:08.382 --> 25:11.833
at the local gang banger hangout
across the street.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.015
What's his problem?

25:25.108 --> 25:29.106
Latin petulance. Hold on.
Give me a minute with him.

25:29.988 --> 25:33.571
All right, come on,
princess, spit it out.

25:35.703 --> 25:38.954
Why do we need that bitch on the
team? You don’t like what I'm doing?

25:39.041 --> 25:42.161
I can hear you.

25:42.253 --> 25:45.836
Hey, baby, why don’t you take a walk
and let me handle this?

25:46.257 --> 25:49.871
First, she ain't on the team yet.

25:49.964 --> 25:51.673
OK?

25:51.758 --> 25:54.249
Second of all,

25:54.344 --> 25:56.385
take a look at her.

25:56.556 --> 25:59.226
I mean, come on, man, she ain't ugly.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.015
You and I walk down the street,
what do people see?

26:02.103 --> 26:04.096
A couple of losers, right?

26:04.189 --> 26:07.973
We add her to the equation, you know
what people are gonna think?

26:08.068 --> 26:08.982
What?

26:09.069 --> 26:13.696
There goes two of the coolest
mother fuckers who ever lived.

26:15.743 --> 26:19.029
You know what?
I don't know about you, man, but...

26:19.122 --> 26:22.289
I'm already
a cool motherfucker, you know?

26:22.376 --> 26:25.081
Sometimes you got
your own tongue up your ass.

26:25.170 --> 26:27.959
Little fuckin' pendejo.

26:29.468 --> 26:33.595
I could feel the blood
coursing through my veins.

26:35.265 --> 26:38.469
Merry Christmas.
Did you ever use one of these?

26:38.560 --> 26:41.596
Ever heard of the
Beverly Hills Gun Club?

26:44.942 --> 26:47.860
Shotgun in hand,
kicking down a door and wondering

26:47.946 --> 26:50.104
if there was heavy firepower
on the other side.

26:50.198 --> 26:52.523
Domino, you cover the side.

26:52.617 --> 26:54.989
Choco, you cover the rear.

26:55.078 --> 26:57.450
On my word.

26:58.373 --> 27:00.117
Turns out...

27:00.208 --> 27:03.294
my first raid was to be
a near-disaster.

27:06.383 --> 27:08.709
That bitch Louise set us up.

27:08.802 --> 27:10.925
Hector was hiding underneath
her bed all along.

27:11.012 --> 27:14.713
- Hey, what's up, fool?
- Hurry! There's 3 po-pos out front!

27:14.808 --> 27:17.050
Fuck. You serious?

27:23.443 --> 27:25.851
Ed On my go.

27:28.281 --> 27:29.856
Go.

27:44.921 --> 27:49.251
That night, my coin was tossed.

27:50.177 --> 27:52.929
Heads, you live. Tails, you die.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.893
50/50 chance.

28:01.398 --> 28:03.105
Life or death.

28:12.326 --> 28:14.484
This ain't Sunset Boulevard.

28:16.622 --> 28:19.576
My destiny was life.

28:27.844 --> 28:30.514
Life as a bounty hunter.

28:34.392 --> 28:36.634
Put that shit down, homey!

28:36.728 --> 28:40.180
What the fuck you doin', bitch?!
Step back, motherfucker!

28:49.158 --> 28:50.819
What the fuck you want?

28:50.910 --> 28:54.076
We're not cops. We're bounty hunters.
All we want is Hector.

28:54.163 --> 28:56.452
Fuck you and the fuckin' po-pos, bitch!

28:56.541 --> 28:58.914
You tell me where he is,
and I'll give you...

28:59.003 --> 29:00.201
You'll what?

29:00.296 --> 29:05.004
Sometimes a girl has to be
naughty to get herself out of a jam.

29:05.092 --> 29:07.002
I'll give you a lap dance.

29:07.095 --> 29:08.969
Man, fuck you, bitch!

29:09.056 --> 29:11.804
I'll give you a lap dance,
bra and panties on.

29:11.888 --> 29:15.221
Man, if I wanted all that,
I'd go to a strip joint, motherfucker.

29:15.308 --> 29:17.716
Come on, you and me.

29:19.063 --> 29:20.937
You know you want it.

29:21.941 --> 29:24.265
Hey, what do you think, dawg?

29:24.359 --> 29:26.399
I want to see what the fuck
this bitch is workin' with.

29:26.487 --> 29:29.938
- I'm offering it to you, baby. Come on.
- Is that right?

29:30.741 --> 29:33.197
Well, take off your clothes, bitch.

29:35.997 --> 29:38.323
Sit down.

29:40.419 --> 29:42.328
That's right, girl.
That's right, girl.

30:05.864 --> 30:07.656
It worked.

30:07.866 --> 30:10.867
We got the scoop
on how to find Hector.

30:10.953 --> 30:13.029
2 weeks later, we nailed him.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.332
Claremont was Charlie
to our three Angels.

30:20.421 --> 30:24.918
It's very simple. The...
DMV is the de facto conduit

30:25.009 --> 30:26.836
for all humanity,

30:26.928 --> 30:28.838
and every human being
that we track down

30:28.931 --> 30:31.849
has a record in the DMV database.

30:31.935 --> 30:35.469
Whether it be LAPD,
Social Services,

30:35.563 --> 30:37.354
the Credit Bureau, or the FBI,

30:37.440 --> 30:39.932
they all use the DMV's database
as their hub.

30:40.027 --> 30:43.231
So, we have people on the inside
who feed us the information.

30:43.322 --> 30:45.113
This one right there.

30:45.449 --> 30:48.450
Shit. And who would know it?

30:48.536 --> 30:53.739
The gatekeepers of humanity turn out
to be a bunch of sassy black women.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.460
Excuse me?

31:02.547 --> 31:04.753
He said he liked your suit.

31:06.467 --> 31:08.923
- Tell him what you said.
- I like your suit.

31:20.317 --> 31:24.018
After 6 months,
Claremont hired Alf to drive us around.

31:24.113 --> 31:26.650
We were so busy.

31:29.953 --> 31:35.291
Little did I know that the FBI liked
to keep tabs on us bounty hunters.

31:37.794 --> 31:41.413
Ed, what did you do
before you were a bounty hunter?

31:41.506 --> 31:45.006
I played music. I was a musician.

31:45.094 --> 31:46.588
Really?

31:46.679 --> 31:48.588
What, in a band?

31:49.640 --> 31:51.551
Did you ever hear
of Stevie Ray Vaughan?

31:51.644 --> 31:53.802
Wait, you're shitting me.

31:54.689 --> 31:57.523
Stevie and I hooked up in Austin.

31:58.609 --> 32:02.192
Back in the day,
we did the bus tour thing together.

32:02.697 --> 32:06.113
Played every goddamn
small club that would have us.

32:08.370 --> 32:11.905
Yep. Me and that boy, we tore it up.

32:14.335 --> 32:16.042
Holy shit.

32:16.127 --> 32:19.579
Played with Pat Benatar,
but that was only when I needed cash.

32:19.674 --> 32:22.711
Fuck off. I love Pat Benatar.

32:22.802 --> 32:25.009
Hey... So did I.

32:26.138 --> 32:28.677
But that's another story.

32:29.849 --> 32:32.219
Love is a battlefield, baby.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.647
What about Choco?
How did you meet him?

32:43.280 --> 32:46.032
I met Choco on the street...

32:46.116 --> 32:49.200
a few hours after he got out of lockup.

32:49.285 --> 32:53.154
He was standing there
in a pair of those jailhouse slippers.

32:54.042 --> 32:57.825
He didn't have a nickel in his pocket
or a place to sleep.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.162
We started talking, and I liked the kid.

33:00.256 --> 33:02.664
Like a little brother.

33:03.635 --> 33:05.426
You know?

33:05.512 --> 33:08.298
Worst thing in the world
is to be caged up.

33:08.389 --> 33:12.768
That boy has been there,
and he ain't never goin' back.

33:12.853 --> 33:15.891
Even if it costs him his life.

33:22.781 --> 33:25.948
- What you lookin' at, darlin'?
- Nothing!

33:26.035 --> 33:27.743
Put that fucking gun down!

33:29.664 --> 33:31.538
Put the fucking gun down!

33:43.053 --> 33:46.008
Choco grew up
on the streets of Venezuela.

33:46.099 --> 33:47.261
When he was four years old,

33:47.349 --> 33:50.054
he stabbed another kid in the eyeball
with a pencil.

33:52.146 --> 33:54.852
There were wires crossed
somewhere in his soul.

34:19.089 --> 34:23.382
In 2003,
I was named Bounty Hunter of the Year.

34:31.685 --> 34:35.684
To the woman who has brought
beauty and grace

34:35.775 --> 34:37.768
to this profession...

34:37.860 --> 34:40.565
Domino Harve-e-e-ey!

35:01.468 --> 35:04.968
From that day on, Eddie,
Choco, and I were inseparable.

35:09.269 --> 35:11.641
It turned out
the three sassy black women and Raul

35:11.730 --> 35:16.392
were the gatekeepers of humanity...
the DMV.

35:16.485 --> 35:19.155
Lateesha was one of
Claremont's many mistresses.

35:19.238 --> 35:21.812
Claremont was godfather to us all.

35:22.033 --> 35:25.201
Just look at t that luscious action
right there. Look at that.

35:25.288 --> 35:28.159
Man, I'm gonna get you
a pair of glasses.

35:32.753 --> 35:34.462
Hey.

35:34.547 --> 35:36.623
That's an ass.

36:10.791 --> 36:14.161
Weather's gonna be
a great day today. Lots of sunshine.

36:14.254 --> 36:16.876
Cool temperatures, though.
We should be at 76 degrees.

36:16.965 --> 36:20.832
You know, a guy could get used
to a life this ordinary.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.351
Maybe you should...

36:32.148 --> 36:34.900
Maybe you should fuck her mom, too.

36:35.819 --> 36:39.236
What the fuck is your problem, bitch?

36:39.991 --> 36:41.532
So, who is this Choico?

36:42.117 --> 36:43.660
Mum was terrified for me.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.654
She didn't approve
of my lifestyle one bit.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.871
Is he your new boyfriend?

36:51.127 --> 36:54.378
His name is Choco, and he's not
my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.

36:54.465 --> 36:57.501
Whatever. He's a criminal.
And that Ed Moseby character...

36:57.593 --> 37:00.049
I mean, he's a complete loser.

37:02.806 --> 37:05.974
He knew Frank Sinatra.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.348
Who didn't?

37:16.405 --> 37:20.948
We may have been
dysfunctional, but we worked.

37:21.035 --> 37:22.779
We were family.

37:29.212 --> 37:30.785
Do you know this man?

37:30.876 --> 37:33.960
Yeah, he's a reality television producer.

37:34.045 --> 37:36.715
His name's Mark Heiss.

37:37.591 --> 37:42.503
Mr Heiss was very generous in turning
over some videotapes to the FBI.

37:42.597 --> 37:45.170
There's lots of footage of you.

37:46.226 --> 37:48.895
We know everything.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.552
Mark Heiss
was friends with Mum.

37:50.647 --> 37:52.935
I hate this!

37:53.024 --> 37:54.304
They changed the fucking font!

37:54.400 --> 37:56.975
He heard my story
at some cocktail party.

37:57.071 --> 38:00.025
She's stupid! You're not stupid.

38:00.116 --> 38:01.908
- All right.
- Get Cynthia on the line!

38:01.993 --> 38:05.197
- Well, Domino's in the lobby.
- They changed the fucking font!

38:05.289 --> 38:07.447
Well, Domino's been waiting.

38:07.541 --> 38:09.166
Put her in the conference room.

38:09.251 --> 38:11.209
Turns out, he wanted
to put us on television.

38:12.714 --> 38:16.047
I should let you know that
Mr Heiss will only be available to meet

38:16.134 --> 38:19.420
for about five minutes, so we should
hurry up and cut to the point.

38:21.098 --> 38:25.558
And speak in short sentences
because he has the attention span

38:25.644 --> 38:27.352
of a ferret on crystal meth.

38:27.980 --> 38:30.898
Mum was horrified
and demanded to tag along

38:30.984 --> 38:33.474
just to keep me from signing anything.

38:34.278 --> 38:37.398
- I've seen that.
- Excuse me?

38:37.490 --> 38:39.198
A ferret on crystal meth.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.993
You don’t speak...
you don't speak Spanish?

38:49.087 --> 38:51.045
- No.
- No?

38:52.299 --> 38:55.917
This is LA, man.
You should speak Spanish, you know?

38:58.472 --> 39:01.010
OK, everybody has water...

39:06.689 --> 39:11.015
God, he should be here
any second. Here he is.

39:12.192 --> 39:14.943
- Sophie.
- Hello.

39:15.528 --> 39:19.313
Sorry, guys, about the wait.
I'm having font issues.

39:19.408 --> 39:22.445
Let me cut to the chase
'cause I have to take this call.

39:22.536 --> 39:25.657
We want to follow you around
with a camera crew for a week.

39:25.748 --> 39:29.497
The last thing we did...
the pilot episode... is not testing well.

39:29.586 --> 39:31.495
We got too many rednecks.

39:37.803 --> 39:39.843
It's too much like Cops.

39:39.931 --> 39:41.591
We need... Go ahead.

39:42.434 --> 39:44.010
We need...

39:44.393 --> 39:46.682
something sexy!

39:47.313 --> 39:49.472
Something different.

39:51.484 --> 39:53.478
We need Domino.

39:56.991 --> 39:58.818
We need Domino.

40:01.245 --> 40:03.368
Listen, friend...

40:04.373 --> 40:06.367
we ain't gonna do this thing

40:06.459 --> 40:09.415
unless the whole team
gets equal coverage.

40:09.923 --> 40:13.292
You're not her father, Ed.
No one cares what you think.

40:18.807 --> 40:21.642
Well, with all due respect, Mom,

40:21.726 --> 40:26.354
I'm her boss,
and she's on my team. OK?

40:29.110 --> 40:31.518
And unless we all get equal coverage,

40:31.612 --> 40:34.815
we're all gonna walk the fuck
out of here together?

40:40.163 --> 40:43.699
Equal coverage, or we all walk.

40:43.793 --> 40:45.701
Done! OK.

40:46.421 --> 40:48.746
The whole team... We follow it.

40:48.840 --> 40:52.704
What guarantee can you give us that
Domino's name won’t be tarnished?

40:52.799 --> 40:55.716
Sophie, this is reality television.

40:55.801 --> 40:59.421
What you see is what you get.

40:59.515 --> 41:03.928
You will be exploited,
your story won’t be told truthfully,

41:04.020 --> 41:06.475
and your life will never be the same.

41:06.563 --> 41:09.233
I beg you.

41:09.316 --> 41:12.520
I beg you not to get involved with this...

41:12.612 --> 41:14.604
this drivel!

41:15.782 --> 41:18.451
No offence, Mark,
but we both know that this is drivel.

41:18.535 --> 41:20.694
No offence taken.

41:20.787 --> 41:23.575
Anyway, if she's gonna be in anything,
she should be in the centre.

41:23.666 --> 41:25.907
Sure, OK.

41:26.001 --> 41:28.208
But...

41:28.296 --> 41:30.372
Done!

41:30.465 --> 41:33.253
Talk it over. I have to take this call.

41:33.344 --> 41:36.962
Cynthia, you changed the fucking font
on the promo! Why?

41:37.056 --> 41:41.006
I felt like a hypocrite,
given my hatred of all things Hollywood,

41:41.102 --> 41:43.427
but I'll admit...

41:43.521 --> 41:45.477
I wanted my story told.

41:46.315 --> 41:49.234
I wanted everyone to know
the things I'd done.

41:49.319 --> 41:51.941
I wanted some recognition
in the world.

41:54.408 --> 41:55.902
We'll do it.

41:58.078 --> 42:00.237
We'll do it.

42:01.415 --> 42:04.582
God help us. God help us all.

42:04.669 --> 42:07.705
It was the beginning of the end.

42:09.383 --> 42:11.672
Jerry! Jerry!

42:11.761 --> 42:16.304
Welcome back. We're here in LA
with mixed race single mothers.

42:16.390 --> 42:18.798
Our next guest
takes pride in the fact

42:18.893 --> 42:21.135
that she's in the Guinness
Book of World Records

42:21.229 --> 42:25.062
for being America's
youngest grandmother.

42:25.151 --> 42:28.602
And... she's only 28.

42:28.695 --> 42:30.898
Please welcome Lateesha Rodriguez!

42:30.986 --> 42:33.857
Lateesha was
our prime contact at the DMV.

42:33.947 --> 42:37.529
Most of our bond certificates
came from Claremont through her.

42:41.164 --> 42:43.121
- Hey, Jerry!
- Hey, Lateesha. How are you?

42:43.208 --> 42:44.916
- I'm fine.
- What's going on?

42:45.001 --> 42:48.334
I'm here today to speak
for all people of mixed race in America.

42:48.421 --> 42:52.254
Now, as a blactino woman, I believe
we deserve our own race category

42:52.343 --> 42:55.130
to forge an identity, Jerry.
That's how I feel.

42:55.221 --> 42:57.510
Did you just say "blactino"?

42:57.599 --> 42:59.638
Yes, I did. I'm a blactino-American.

42:59.726 --> 43:01.553
First of all...

43:01.645 --> 43:03.685
first of all, you don't even look Latino.

43:03.772 --> 43:05.931
You look black.
You're... You're black.

43:06.025 --> 43:09.061
Second of all, I'm of mixed race,
and I've struggled my whole life

43:09.152 --> 43:11.441
as to whether I'm Chinese
or whether I'm black.

43:11.530 --> 43:13.939
Chinegro! What you are is chinegro!

43:14.034 --> 43:16.276
- Chinegro?
- Chinegro! There you go!

43:16.370 --> 43:18.445
- Chinegro?
- You are a chinegro!

43:18.538 --> 43:23.034
- What the is chinegro?
- That's what you are! Chinegro is you!

43:23.126 --> 43:25.452
That's some bulls...

43:25.546 --> 43:29.044
OK, as I understand it, you brought
a mixed-race flow chart with you.

43:29.132 --> 43:32.052
Why don’t we bring that out?

43:33.514 --> 43:37.381
How you doin', sugar? All right.
I'm gonna call you later.

43:37.476 --> 43:39.931
All right.

43:41.230 --> 43:42.724
Take a look at this...

43:42.815 --> 43:46.517
Blactino, black Asian, hispasian, OK?

43:46.612 --> 43:49.695
Now, for the Asian subcategories,
I got you, sister.

43:49.781 --> 43:52.818
We have chinegro right here.
That's you. Chinegro.

43:52.909 --> 43:55.033
That's not a word! That's not a word!

43:55.120 --> 43:59.367
Yes, it is, sister.
We have koreagro. Japegro, OK?

44:01.334 --> 44:04.621
Chispanic, koreaspanic,
and last but not least,

44:04.714 --> 44:07.833
check this out, y'all... japanic.

44:07.967 --> 44:10.122
That's how I flow with it!

44:10.215 --> 44:14.131
Do you believe the government should
recognise these racial subgroups?

44:14.221 --> 44:15.680
Yes, Jerry, I do.

44:15.764 --> 44:17.009
Hey, wait!

44:17.099 --> 44:19.887
First of all, first of all,
honey, let me tell you,

44:19.977 --> 44:22.765
from one, blactino woman
to another...

44:22.856 --> 44:25.228
- Right on.
- Our concern is education!

44:25.317 --> 44:28.650
You ever hear of that?! Here you are,
a 28-year-old grandmother!

44:28.736 --> 44:30.563
Yes, I am.

44:30.655 --> 44:32.731
You need to add another category
to your flow chart.

44:32.824 --> 44:36.407
It's called birth control, bitch!

44:40.165 --> 44:42.573
OK, yeah. Check this out.

44:42.668 --> 44:44.875
I am educated, you blactino bitch!

44:44.963 --> 44:46.161
What?!

44:46.256 --> 44:49.422
I'm a Devry graduate! And, yes,
my daughter might be a single mother...

44:49.508 --> 44:53.508
- I'll kick your ass! I'll kick your ass!
- Bring it, bitch!

44:53.598 --> 44:57.893
Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

45:13.411 --> 45:16.911
- Come on, Bri. We're late, we're late.
- Dude, it's fucking Map quest.

45:16.998 --> 45:18.990
I told you, never again
with that piece of shit.

45:19.083 --> 45:20.577
Guys.

45:22.086 --> 45:23.664
Come meet Domino.

45:23.755 --> 45:27.706
Domino, I want you to meet
the co-hosts of Bounty Squad.

45:28.845 --> 45:31.845
Fucking... fucking... fucking...

45:31.931 --> 45:35.930
fucking 90210.
I couldn't get away from it.

45:36.019 --> 45:38.012
It wasn’t until later on that I realised

45:38.105 --> 45:41.141
Mum had gotten to Heiss
and pulled some strings.

45:41.233 --> 45:43.060
Ian Ziering.

45:44.279 --> 45:47.482
Brian Austin Green. Domino.

45:49.575 --> 45:51.196
Cocoa... Choco.

45:51.282 --> 45:53.440
- Cocoa?
- Choco.

45:53.534 --> 45:55.326
Choco. Sorry.

45:55.411 --> 45:57.203
The man from Afghanistan

45:57.288 --> 46:01.073
has made some significant
changes to the RV.

46:02.711 --> 46:04.538
My God.

46:18.897 --> 46:21.731
Are those real bones?

46:21.816 --> 46:24.354
Monkey... monkey bones?

46:25.069 --> 46:27.442
Shrunken heads?

46:27.530 --> 46:29.607
From my family.

46:29.908 --> 46:32.908
I drive these bounty hunters
for a free Afghanistan.

46:32.994 --> 46:36.909
I didn't know
this was gonna be a political show.

46:39.085 --> 46:44.209
Alf grew up during the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan.

46:49.012 --> 46:52.428
He had always wanted to be
part of the revolution

46:53.767 --> 46:56.389
but it seemed to pass him by.

46:59.232 --> 47:01.189
At the tender age of 14,

47:01.275 --> 47:04.395
he decided that explosives
would be his speciality.

47:25.219 --> 47:27.675
His eyebrows
never grew back.

47:30.262 --> 47:32.752
OK, Ed...

47:32.847 --> 47:35.469
What background should someone have
if they want to go into bounty hunting?

47:35.559 --> 47:37.932
How does jail sound?

47:41.317 --> 47:43.558
So, tell me, do you boys hunt?

47:43.652 --> 47:45.977
I killed a... I killed a squirrel...

47:47.781 --> 47:49.609
once.

47:53.954 --> 47:59.033
Well, let me tell you something.
Once you hunt a human being,

48:00.170 --> 48:02.708
you'll never hunt an animal again.

48:02.797 --> 48:04.790
You know, it's a different kind of rush.

48:04.883 --> 48:08.798
The problem is, is that when
you've done it for as long as I have,

48:08.887 --> 48:10.797
all you got to show for it is

48:10.890 --> 48:14.591
an empty bank account and, IBS.

48:17.105 --> 48:20.273
- IBS?
- Yeah, that's irritable bowel syndrome.

48:20.360 --> 48:25.151
You got a spastic colon?
That's hysterical.

48:25.239 --> 48:27.398
You know, my grandmother
has one of those.

48:27.491 --> 48:29.568
Does your grandmother hunt?

48:30.537 --> 48:33.206
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

48:35.500 --> 48:38.786
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up?

48:46.178 --> 48:49.097
You were supposed to talk about
the healthcare crisis!

48:49.182 --> 48:51.887
Exactly. Why would you use
Jerry Springer

48:51.977 --> 48:56.224
as a platform for some kind of
progressive race modification proposal?

48:56.314 --> 48:59.269
Well, I don't think Ted Koppel
would blook Lateesha Rodriguez!

48:59.359 --> 49:03.192
- Not a chance.
- Not a chance in hell.

49:03.280 --> 49:05.773
OK, Jerry is one of the only forums
our people have, baby.

49:05.868 --> 49:08.785
I thought having time on Springer
would give me a chance

49:08.871 --> 49:12.616
of gettin' a blook deal
or a correspondence gig on BET.

49:12.705 --> 49:14.198
Jenny Jones bitch got cancelled.

49:14.289 --> 49:16.614
Yeah, Montel would've been better.

49:22.591 --> 49:25.840
Lateesha's granddaughter
Mika had a rare blood disease.

49:25.927 --> 49:28.845
Her white cell count was dropping fast.

49:28.930 --> 49:30.555
Dad?

49:31.767 --> 49:34.008
We need money.

49:37.313 --> 49:38.975
I got an idea.

49:39.066 --> 49:40.561
What?

49:40.651 --> 49:42.444
Armoured car business.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.771
We just signed a new
insurance policy in Nevada.

49:45.866 --> 49:47.823
There's a loophole.

49:51.121 --> 49:54.371
Claremont Williams,
bail bondsman,

49:54.457 --> 49:58.670
armoured car service,
bounty hunter service.

49:58.755 --> 50:01.127
An unusual combination.

50:05.637 --> 50:07.629
Kee Kee, me and Claremont

50:07.722 --> 50:11.056
are working on a plan
to get money for Mika.

50:12.562 --> 50:15.812
A real good plan, baby... a good plan.

50:19.027 --> 50:21.269
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez
has been running

50:21.363 --> 50:23.273
a counterfeit driver's licence racket?

50:23.366 --> 50:25.773
Well, that's the word on the street.

50:28.580 --> 50:30.905
You drove Lateesha's daughter
to school,

50:30.999 --> 50:34.119
then dropped her off
at the DMV. Why?

50:34.211 --> 50:36.499
Her car was in the shop.

50:40.384 --> 50:45.295
How convenient. The morning
you call in sick, I turn on the TV

50:45.389 --> 50:49.055
and see you all over Jerry Springer.

50:51.267 --> 50:53.805
- Never heard of Ti Vo?
- Think I can afford it?

50:53.895 --> 50:56.266
Give me a break, Pat.
What do you want?

50:56.355 --> 50:59.938
I got a call yesterday from
our health care provider.

51:00.026 --> 51:02.600
They said you tried to pass your
granddaughter off as Kee Kee

51:02.696 --> 51:05.448
down at City Terrace
Community Hospital.

51:05.533 --> 51:09.448
They said you forged the age on the
application for some sort of operation.

51:09.537 --> 51:13.120
Mother fuckin' HMOs
don't cover grandchildren.

51:13.208 --> 51:17.668
That fuckin' operation is $300,000.
Where am I gonna get the money, Pat?

51:17.754 --> 51:22.666
You should've thought about that
before you became a grandmother.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.884
Fuck you.

51:25.888 --> 51:29.388
You got 2 weeks to clear out your desk.

51:29.475 --> 51:32.430
It just kept
getting worse for Lateesha.

51:32.520 --> 51:35.890
- What?
- Did I stutter? 2 weeks.

51:36.525 --> 51:39.360
No one could've
expected what happened next.

51:39.445 --> 51:44.689
By the way, there are a couple of
FBI agents here that want to talk to you.

51:50.040 --> 51:53.541
You're gonna go to jail
for a long, long time, Lateesha.

51:54.129 --> 51:56.085
Unless you cooperate with us.

51:56.172 --> 51:59.126
Their names
were Cosgrove and Wilson.

51:59.217 --> 52:02.088
Someone had tipped them off
to Lateesha's counterfeit scam,

52:02.178 --> 52:04.752
but that's not what
they were really after.

52:04.848 --> 52:06.555
I'm listening.

52:06.641 --> 52:09.050
In about 10 minutes,
a college kid named Frances

52:09.144 --> 52:12.893
is gonna walk up to your window
and ask for 4counterfeit IDs.

52:14.359 --> 52:15.936
You could help us out here.

52:16.026 --> 52:18.517
Lateesha, we want
to know what he’s up to.

52:18.612 --> 52:22.824
I mean, look at you. You got your hair
did, your nails lookin' all good.

52:22.909 --> 52:25.948
You go to jail, that's all gonna go away.

52:26.039 --> 52:28.327
- Won't see your kids for a long time.
- Think about it.

52:28.416 --> 52:30.571
It's gonna be long as hell.

52:32.375 --> 52:35.293
This was when Lateesha
decided to do something foolish,

52:35.378 --> 52:38.711
and Frances was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

52:38.798 --> 52:40.256
OK.

52:41.843 --> 52:46.885
OK. He and three of his friends
are gonna hijack an armoured truck.

52:49.434 --> 52:52.970
They're gonna walk away
with 10 million in cash.

52:53.063 --> 52:55.056
10 million.

52:56.983 --> 53:01.980
Now serving GO86.

53:05.244 --> 53:06.524
Hey.

53:25.266 --> 53:28.350
Weather Sunshine, that's for sure.
We should be at 76 degrees,

53:28.435 --> 53:31.639
the downtown area barely breaking
that 70-degree mark.

53:31.731 --> 53:35.350
66 was the high yesterday. Overnight
lows dropping down to 48 degrees.

53:35.444 --> 53:37.769
All right, y'all, Lateesha done...

53:37.862 --> 53:41.030
Lateesha done dug herself a deep hole,

53:41.116 --> 53:44.616
and, she can't get out by herself.

53:44.703 --> 53:46.613
Can y'all dig what l’m saying?

53:46.706 --> 53:49.957
Mija, we're in a hole together.
We dig together. We're a team.

53:50.044 --> 53:52.998
Just like Billy Ocean says:
"When the going gets tough..."

53:53.089 --> 53:55.414
"the tough get going."

53:58.969 --> 54:01.508
There are 3 kinds
of people in this world...

54:01.597 --> 54:03.507
the rich,

54:03.599 --> 54:06.555
the poor, and everyone in between.

54:06.646 --> 54:09.314
Think you're having a tough day?
You should see this.

54:09.398 --> 54:11.552
I got an armoured truck that's empty.
Yeah.

54:11.646 --> 54:14.316
I think Mr Wonderful is pulling up now.

54:20.780 --> 54:24.780
That's Drake Bishop, owner
of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.

54:24.869 --> 54:28.997
He's worth a billion dollars,
10 million of it recently stolen.

54:29.081 --> 54:31.574
His attorney, Burke Beckett.

54:31.668 --> 54:34.504
- I'm Detective Chris Cudlitz.
- We know who you are.

54:34.588 --> 54:35.620
Where's my money?

54:35.715 --> 54:38.715
I think it’s probably best
if we take a look at the tapes.

54:43.682 --> 54:46.090
Our tapes show
that at 6:23am,

54:46.185 --> 54:50.597
your truck pulls into the parking lot
and turns the engine off.

54:52.941 --> 54:55.729
- Rewind, please.
- Rewind the tape.

54:59.031 --> 55:02.116
- Freeze the tape.
- Freeze the tape.

55:02.952 --> 55:05.788
- Now, can you zoom in?
- Zoom in, please.

55:05.872 --> 55:08.328
You a fucking mockingbird?
Shut the fuck up!

55:08.417 --> 55:10.076
I just...

55:15.884 --> 55:19.253
- Nancy Reagan.
- I think that's Hillary Clinton.

55:19.346 --> 55:23.130
- Fat ankles.
- It's Barbara fucking Bush.

55:23.225 --> 55:26.060
And Jacqueline Onassis
just to her left.

55:26.145 --> 55:29.596
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned
First Ladies.

55:30.441 --> 55:32.933
If you don’t mind me
asking you, Mr Bishop,

55:33.028 --> 55:35.104
what exactly is in those tan duffel bags?

55:35.197 --> 55:39.195
- You don’t have to answer that.
- Shut up, Burke. $10 million, cash.

55:39.285 --> 55:42.154
Don't tell me it was a fucking hijacking.

55:43.955 --> 55:46.662
How'd you get me
in this position, Burke?

55:46.751 --> 55:49.751
Mr. Bishop?
You have an urgent telephone call, sir.

55:50.876 --> 55:52.704
Yeah. Bishop.

55:53.004 --> 55:55.330
Bishop, this is Claremont Williams.

55:55.424 --> 55:58.875
I own the Williams Brothers
Armoured Car Service.

55:58.969 --> 56:00.131
Yeah.

56:00.220 --> 56:02.793
Hold on a minute, please.

56:13.985 --> 56:15.266
Let me isolate it.

56:16.029 --> 56:19.861
Yesterday I received
an e-mail from a source.

56:19.951 --> 56:22.655
In this e-mail were
four social security numbers

56:22.745 --> 56:25.414
made to counterfeit
California driver's licences.

56:25.498 --> 56:26.743
And?

56:26.833 --> 56:29.454
I believe these are the gentlemen
who robbed us, sir.

56:29.544 --> 56:32.711
I'm also a bail bondsman
out of Los Angeles,

56:32.798 --> 56:36.879
and I can track down and deliver these
thieves to you for a small finder's fee.

56:36.970 --> 56:40.339
- How much?
- Just $300,000.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.307
And what happens
if you don't deliver?

56:43.393 --> 56:47.557
My theft insurance policy
will have to fork over that $10 million.

56:47.648 --> 56:49.557
That will take 6-8 months.

56:49.650 --> 56:52.270
But you should know, sir,
that I employ bounty hunters,

56:52.360 --> 56:55.695
and my bounty hunters can and will
track down these thieves.

56:55.782 --> 56:59.732
Well, you deliver these crooks to me
and you've got yourself a deal...

56:59.828 --> 57:01.072
300,000.

57:01.162 --> 57:03.534
Thank you, sir. That's a deal.

57:06.960 --> 57:09.914
Crime boss Anthony Cigliutti.

57:11.465 --> 57:15.546
Bishop's attorney had put his boss
in business with the mob.

57:15.637 --> 57:17.345
They're asking for a finder’s fee.

57:17.431 --> 57:20.349
Finder's fee? That's bullshit.

57:20.434 --> 57:22.722
Sounds like an inside job to me.

57:22.811 --> 57:25.384
Could be. Who knows
if this Claremont Williams

57:25.480 --> 57:27.273
is in on the heist or not.

57:27.358 --> 57:30.854
All I know, if this joker
delivers the First Ladies,

57:30.942 --> 57:33.812
we'll split the 300,000 fee with you.

57:36.405 --> 57:40.190
All right, gentlemen.
Sounds like we got a little situation here.

57:41.202 --> 57:44.120
Quite a mess indeed.

57:44.206 --> 57:48.667
Beckett had just brokered
an underhanded deal with Cigliutti.

57:48.752 --> 57:51.623
The 10 million,
en route from LA to Vegas,

57:51.713 --> 57:53.207
belonged to the mob.

57:53.298 --> 57:57.843
Bishop's clean reputation was a great
cover for laundered cash.

57:58.805 --> 58:01.724
If the FBI could link
the two men together,

58:01.810 --> 58:04.134
it would be the takedown of the century.

58:08.441 --> 58:11.941
The FBI was always listening,
hence the underwater cordless.

58:20.663 --> 58:21.742
In Needles.

58:28.546 --> 58:31.796
Locus Fender was brought in
to drive the armoured car,

58:31.883 --> 58:34.255
another one of Claremont's
network of stooges.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.919
His mother Edna
worked at the Nedles DMV.

58:37.015 --> 58:41.060
Mama! You're not gonna believe this.
Mama, come quick!

58:41.770 --> 58:44.225
- Where are the First Ladies?
- They disappeared.

58:44.313 --> 58:45.974
What do you mean, they disappeared?

58:46.065 --> 58:50.110
According to Locus,
they stopped for gas.

58:51.739 --> 58:55.072
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab
a Mountain Dew. Don’t make a peep.

58:55.159 --> 58:57.365
Especially you, Barbara.

59:04.168 --> 59:06.125
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

59:06.212 --> 59:08.336
I need to get...

59:08.424 --> 59:11.089
$8 of gas and...

59:11.173 --> 59:13.959
A Mountain Dew.
Do you have Moonpie?

59:14.050 --> 59:16.541
Yeah, I got a couple of them over there.

59:17.346 --> 59:19.719
And a slim...

59:19.807 --> 59:22.725
Shit! No, no, no!

59:22.811 --> 59:26.678
He was sure they'd nabbed
the cash. Straight-up double-cross.

59:31.862 --> 59:34.400
But they'd left without it.

59:34.781 --> 59:37.699
That doesn’t make any sense.

59:41.290 --> 59:44.124
Well, they left all the money.
It doesn’t make sense...

59:44.209 --> 59:47.708
Locus! Fuck ‘em. Their loss is our gain.

59:47.796 --> 59:49.587
Put the money in the freezer.

59:49.673 --> 59:53.007
- Mama?
- Locus... Fuck ‘em.

59:53.636 --> 59:54.880
OK, Mama.

59:54.970 --> 59:59.184
Either this was some kind of
setup, or the First Ladies got scared,

59:59.268 --> 01:00:01.177
decided to pull out and cut their losses.

01:00:04.898 --> 01:00:07.650
Are you wearing makeup?

01:00:07.735 --> 01:00:09.811
What, can you tell?

01:00:09.904 --> 01:00:13.107
You're wearing eyeliner, man.
You look like a drag queen.

01:00:13.908 --> 01:00:15.735
Who the hell is that?

01:00:30.509 --> 01:00:33.714
Guys, it's time.
We need the bounty hunters.

01:00:33.806 --> 01:00:36.474
Come on! 110%.

01:00:36.558 --> 01:00:40.058
Looks like Night of the Living Dead.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.314
Are we on? Now?

01:00:44.401 --> 01:00:45.349
Yeah, now.

01:00:45.443 --> 01:00:48.979
- Is that a joint?
- No. He's not smoking.

01:00:49.073 --> 01:00:52.770
Put that down. You know, television...
the people watching, those kids...

01:00:52.864 --> 01:00:53.979
Yeah, yeah...

01:01:00.163 --> 01:01:04.244
Claremont fed us a fake story
about the First Ladies.

01:01:06.045 --> 01:01:08.168
Are we rolling?

01:01:08.256 --> 01:01:11.874
So, today, Domino and her team are out
to nab four criminals for forging checks

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:14.175
with counterfeit driver's licences.

01:01:14.262 --> 01:01:17.216
What can you tell us about
these 4creeps, Domino?

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:21.556
Apparently, they call
themselves the First Ladies.

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:25.965
Jackie Onassis...
his real name was Lester Kincaid.

01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:28.346
Yo, yo, yo yo, yo

01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:36.312
Hey, Rochelle.
Put your mama on the phone.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.025
Hey, what's happening, baby?

01:01:38.446 --> 01:01:40.237
Lester Kincaid, you're going to jail.

01:01:40.323 --> 01:01:42.779
What the fuck is this shit? Hey, man!

01:01:43.993 --> 01:01:46.365
I need clearances.

01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:54.620
- Go, go.
- Cho... Chocko... Choco.

01:01:54.713 --> 01:01:56.789
Jesus. This guy's a psychopath.

01:01:56.882 --> 01:02:01.343
What do we get for $10?
Everything you want.

01:02:01.429 --> 01:02:05.807
Nancy Reagan turned out to
be a sex addict named Howie Stein.

01:02:05.893 --> 01:02:10.305
My name is Howie, and I am
a recovering nymphomaniac.

01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:12.854
Yeah!
Hi, Howie.

01:02:22.953 --> 01:02:25.989
Now, if 2 Live Crew
has taught us anything,

01:02:26.081 --> 01:02:30.158
it's that horniness in today's society
is out of control.

01:02:30.248 --> 01:02:32.656
And at one point
within the next decade,

01:02:32.751 --> 01:02:34.459
mark my words, ladies and gentlemen,

01:02:34.545 --> 01:02:37.830
society will have reached
something I call...

01:02:37.923 --> 01:02:39.999
APATT...

01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:44.469
"All porno, all the time."

01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:49.183
Pornography will have become
an epidemic in this country.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:52.306
Phase one... masturbation.

01:02:52.398 --> 01:02:55.399
- Who's this chump?
- That's Howard Stein.

01:02:55.485 --> 01:02:57.856
He's an entertainment lawyer,
some shit firm.

01:02:57.945 --> 01:02:59.226
Love him.

01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:01.279
He's so attractive.

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:03.443
And to our female friends here today,

01:03:03.536 --> 01:03:08.612
we must not abuse of our dogs with
the lure of a peanut butter snatch.

01:03:08.707 --> 01:03:11.993
We must channel our horniness
into extracurricular activities.

01:03:12.086 --> 01:03:14.873
Howard Stein, you're under arrest.

01:03:14.964 --> 01:03:18.713
Whoa! Look, he's got him by the eyes.

01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:31.103
Barbara Bush
and Hillary Clinton were next.

01:03:37.673 --> 01:03:40.164
Frances and Charles Cigliutti.

01:03:40.259 --> 01:03:44.091
Their father was mob boss
Anthony Cigliutti. They were Mafia kids.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:47.430
We found them at their frat house, and
they'd been under FBI surveillance

01:03:47.517 --> 01:03:49.805
for the past six months.

01:04:02.074 --> 01:04:04.399
All right, boys, we're in business.

01:04:04.493 --> 01:04:07.449
Yeah. The bounty hunters have arrived.

01:04:08.957 --> 01:04:12.074
They're driving Winne...
driving Winnebagos?

01:04:16.045 --> 01:04:18.617
What is this shit?

01:04:20.507 --> 01:04:23.045
Is that the guy from
Beverly Hills 90210?

01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:26.636
- I fuckin' loved that show, man.
- Well, he hasn't aged well.

01:04:33.605 --> 01:04:36.891
We're looking for Frances and Charles!
Are they here?

01:04:40.737 --> 01:04:44.321
We're from a new reality TV show.
It's called Bounty Squad.

01:04:45.869 --> 01:04:49.285
Jesus, look at that.
She just tells it like it is.

01:04:49.373 --> 01:04:52.290
It's... It's... we should sign her.

01:05:04.097 --> 01:05:05.924
Frances! Frances!

01:05:06.016 --> 01:05:10.176
Frances! Frances!

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:13.889
All right, 60 seconds.
Here's the question.

01:05:14.525 --> 01:05:16.815
Which one of you is Frances?

01:05:57.485 --> 01:05:58.683
This girl is gonna be a star.

01:05:58.778 --> 01:06:02.313
We should sign her
to a talent holding deal.

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:04.699
Stay down!

01:06:04.784 --> 01:06:06.861
Fucker!

01:06:29.146 --> 01:06:31.221
Fuck!

01:06:49.042 --> 01:06:50.999
Fuck.

01:06:51.086 --> 01:06:54.087
I told him back off.
It's too psychotic.

01:07:09.982 --> 01:07:11.724
- Hello?
- You get all four?

01:07:11.816 --> 01:07:14.024
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:16.437
Deliver them to the Needles DMV,

01:07:16.531 --> 01:07:18.903
sundown,
the Sam Kinison Monument.

01:07:18.992 --> 01:07:21.068
Why in the fuck out there?

01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:24.944
Listen, I can't even find any warrants
in the system for these four.

01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:28.124
The system hasn't been updated is all.

01:07:46.142 --> 01:07:48.551
- Hey.
- How you doing?

01:07:51.357 --> 01:07:54.726
- This is all an act, isn’t it?
- What is?

01:07:54.819 --> 01:07:58.484
This... this whole tough chick thing.

01:07:59.824 --> 01:08:01.900
What makes you so sure?

01:08:02.534 --> 01:08:04.742
I'm an actor.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.701
You can't fake it like we can.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.456
You know what I think?

01:08:10.544 --> 01:08:14.293
I think you're just a scared little girl
with some serious daddy issues.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:30.346
Motherfucker!

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:33.684
You... you broke my fuckin' nose!

01:08:37.323 --> 01:08:39.116
Thanks.

01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:43.866
My friend Tina,
she thought you were dead.

01:08:43.956 --> 01:08:48.665
Really? Well, tell your friend Tina...
she's a whore.

01:09:00.642 --> 01:09:03.642
- It's still bleeding.
- I can’t believe this fucking bitch.

01:09:03.728 --> 01:09:05.850
- I'm sorry!

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:11.099
Where are the bond certificates?

01:09:11.191 --> 01:09:13.895
There are no bond certificates.

01:09:16.697 --> 01:09:18.404
Claremont didn’t provide them?

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:20.982
He didn't give me anything.

01:09:21.076 --> 01:09:24.077
Hey, Claremont said
drop the First Ladies off in Needles,

01:09:24.162 --> 01:09:27.448
go home and don't ask any questions.

01:09:32.673 --> 01:09:37.300
There's only one reason that we
wouldn’t have any bond certificates.

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:45.979
These guys have never been arrested.

01:09:47.856 --> 01:09:50.774
Is this an inside job?

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:18.048
- No, that's bullshit...
- Do you believe what's going on?

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:21.058
No, I didn't sign on for this shit, Terry.
I got punched in the...

01:10:21.143 --> 01:10:24.145
Get the fuckin' camera
off me right now, please.

01:10:25.814 --> 01:10:30.441
Put down the camera.
Turn the fucking camera off!

01:10:30.528 --> 01:10:33.019
What happens now?

01:10:33.114 --> 01:10:34.906
The tour is cancelled.

01:10:34.991 --> 01:10:37.364
You drove us to Needles
to putus in jail?

01:10:37.452 --> 01:10:39.860
Come on, move! Getup. Come on.

01:10:39.955 --> 01:10:42.244
Turn the fucking camera off!

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:44.705
Don’t listen to her. Keep filming.

01:10:44.793 --> 01:10:46.073
Fucker!

01:10:55.009 --> 01:10:57.002
Fuck!

01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:12.438
- I ain't worth this shit.
- Shut the fuck up and walk.

01:11:12.529 --> 01:11:14.189
- These aren't cops.
- No shit.

01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:16.273
Watch your mouth. God is listening.

01:11:16.366 --> 01:11:18.405
Come over here, good-looking.

01:11:18.493 --> 01:11:20.569
Here's your First Ladies.

01:11:20.662 --> 01:11:23.498
Pleasure doing business with you.

01:11:23.582 --> 01:11:26.073
She told me she was 18.

01:11:39.558 --> 01:11:42.763
- Ow. Fuck!
- I hit my head, too.

01:11:42.855 --> 01:11:47.563
Why the fuck are we staying
in this shithole? This is ridiculous.

01:11:47.651 --> 01:11:49.359
Guys.

01:11:51.697 --> 01:11:54.983
The footage we captured for that
was phenomenal.

01:11:55.076 --> 01:11:56.902
Did you get the broken fuckin' nose?

01:11:56.993 --> 01:11:59.782
- It's gonna jumpstart your careers.
- Fuck, yeah.

01:11:59.873 --> 01:12:02.115
Look at my face!

01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:04.166
It's all good.

01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:11.500
You need to start thinking more
positively. We need to celebrate.

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:14.714
- We need to go to, like, a strip club.
- All right.

01:12:25.693 --> 01:12:28.183
Something awful
was about to happen.

01:12:41.664 --> 01:12:43.906
I could feel it in my bones.

01:13:12.282 --> 01:13:16.159
What?

01:13:28.507 --> 01:13:31.295
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

01:13:33.012 --> 01:13:35.764
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

01:13:36.808 --> 01:13:40.260
Do I look South American to you?
I don't understand

01:13:40.354 --> 01:13:41.979
a word you're fucking saying.

01:13:42.065 --> 01:13:45.269
You know what? Ed's right.
It's not cute. It's not fucking cute!

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.776
It's never been fucking cute, Choco!
I don't fucking understand you!

01:13:48.863 --> 01:13:50.821
You're a freak!

01:14:21.186 --> 01:14:25.731
Man, they never show the cum shots
in these shitbag motels.

01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:52.880
Jesus Christ, Choco. I just got done
paying 12.95 for this movie.

01:14:52.971 --> 01:14:57.266
- I'm never gonna know how it ends.
- Don't fuck with me, Ed.

01:14:57.351 --> 01:15:00.601
Listen, Choco, don't go goddamn
King Kong on me, OK?

01:15:00.687 --> 01:15:04.355
If you want to be alone...
if you need me, I'll tell you what...

01:15:04.444 --> 01:15:07.564
I'll be in Domino's room.
I'll be makin' up my own ending.

01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:10.481
Shut up!

01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:14.615
Come on, boy.
I'm gonna whip your ass,

01:15:14.704 --> 01:15:18.370
and then I'm gonna whip your
goddamn girlfriend's ass.

01:15:21.670 --> 01:15:25.004
- Do it!
- Hey, wait a minute...

01:15:28.511 --> 01:15:31.001
What are you doing? Over this?!

01:15:31.096 --> 01:15:33.469
- Pull the fuckin' trigger.
- I will fucking pull it!

01:15:33.557 --> 01:15:36.228
I know it comes easy
to a fucker like you.

01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:39.432
Pull it. Pull the trigger.

01:15:41.858 --> 01:15:45.359
You think I don't know
what the fuck's goin' on?

01:15:47.324 --> 01:15:49.649
Let me tell you something.

01:15:51.865 --> 01:15:53.943
You see this?

01:15:55.037 --> 01:15:57.493
There was no prison riot.

01:15:57.957 --> 01:16:00.411
I blew off my own goddamn toe.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.795
Just to numb the pain.

01:16:05.798 --> 01:16:08.882
Let me tell you something...
we all get weak over women.

01:16:09.636 --> 01:16:12.423
We all get weak over women.

01:16:13.765 --> 01:16:17.265
Fuckin' broads are all nuts.
They know how to kill us.

01:16:17.352 --> 01:16:19.060
And this kid in there...

01:16:19.146 --> 01:16:21.517
she's killin' you.

01:17:05.613 --> 01:17:07.987
Who are you?

01:17:18.712 --> 01:17:20.420
Sir...

01:17:20.506 --> 01:17:22.961
You want me to shoot 'em
in the kneecaps?

01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:26.585
Now, you listen to me.
Hold on one second.

01:17:28.097 --> 01:17:30.880
Ask them politely where the money is.

01:17:30.971 --> 01:17:34.839
If they don't know, just tell them
to start digging their own graves.

01:17:34.934 --> 01:17:37.010
OK.

01:17:48.407 --> 01:17:50.781
- Yeah. Hello?
- Mr. Cigliutti?

01:17:50.869 --> 01:17:54.035
I'm calling from the Zeta Theta Theta
house at Cal West LA.

01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:57.622
- Yes, yes. What is it?
- I'm sorry to be bothering you.

01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:59.916
- It's a bit of an emergency.
- What?

01:18:00.003 --> 01:18:04.416
Your sons have been kidnapped
by these crazy game show hosts.

01:18:04.507 --> 01:18:08.589
Wait, wait, wait. My sons Frances
and Charlie have been kidnapped?

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.589
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

01:18:16.354 --> 01:18:21.147
We don't know about any money.
We were just going to get fake IDs.

01:18:21.234 --> 01:18:25.813
Forgive us, O Lord,
for our daily trespasses...

01:18:27.158 --> 01:18:29.567
for we know not what we do,

01:18:29.662 --> 01:18:32.331
and what we see...

01:18:32.622 --> 01:18:34.580
may not be the truth.

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:38.993
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab
a Mountain Dew. Don’t make a peep.

01:18:39.088 --> 01:18:40.334
Especially you, Barbara.

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:46.462
The three sassy black women
and Raul were the real First Ladies.

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.264
- What now?
- I don't know.

01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:59.352
Hello? Where are you?!

01:18:59.444 --> 01:19:02.943
I'm pullin' up right now.
Evacuate the van, Tee.

01:19:03.031 --> 01:19:05.652
Plans have changed.
We setup the wrong guys.

01:19:12.788 --> 01:19:15.706
The four guys we nabbed
were just Lateesha's patsies.

01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:18.627
It was her sorry luck
they were connected to the mob.

01:19:18.711 --> 01:19:20.918
Get out! Get out of the car!

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.731
You have fucked us so bad.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.612
- I fucked up?
- You heard me.

01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:49.567
You can't help your black, greedy, lyin'
ass from tryin' to get every fuckin' thing.

01:19:49.661 --> 01:19:54.039
All you did is put a death sentence
on my grandbaby. That's all you did.

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:57.370
- Did you know what I was trying to do?
- What?

01:19:57.462 --> 01:19:59.704
What was you tryin' to do, Claremont?!

01:19:59.798 --> 01:20:02.419
- I ain't talkin' to y'all.
- What was you tryin' to get done?

01:20:02.509 --> 01:20:05.179
Shut the fuck up! Everybody!

01:20:05.262 --> 01:20:07.255
You mad because you fucked up!

01:20:07.348 --> 01:20:09.222
Who told you to get
those boys involved?

01:20:09.308 --> 01:20:11.017
What the fuck else did you want?!

01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:13.225
Let's go home right now!

01:20:33.544 --> 01:20:34.374
Hi.

01:20:34.461 --> 01:20:36.537
Domino, we got a problem.

01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:40.379
Lateesha's assumed
the FBI was onto the scam...

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:42.378
the fake ID scam.

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:45.043
She sets up these college kids.

01:20:45.139 --> 01:20:48.805
These kids have been under
FBI surveillance for the last 6 months.

01:20:48.893 --> 01:20:52.389
- What happened to them?
- They might be dead already.

01:20:55.980 --> 01:21:01.272
There's something else
you should know about these kids.

01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:05.027
They're Mafia kids, Cigliutti's kids.

01:21:05.281 --> 01:21:07.773
Jesus Christ.

01:21:07.868 --> 01:21:12.780
What, Anthony Cigliutti? Fuck,
Claremont! You've so fucked us up.

01:21:12.874 --> 01:21:16.244
You set me up to deliver...

01:21:16.336 --> 01:21:21.046
fucking Mafia crime boss children
to be executed.

01:21:21.133 --> 01:21:26.091
Just relax. Just follow my instructions
and we all walk away from this clean.

01:21:28.225 --> 01:21:30.716
Claremont laid it
all out on the table.

01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:34.097
His plan was to ask for
a $300,000 finder's fee

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:38.567
to recover the 10 million he'd stolen.
It all became a huge cluster fuck

01:21:38.652 --> 01:21:42.864
when Lateesha tried to pin it
on the Cigliutti kids.

01:21:42.948 --> 01:21:45.073
Now our only chance for survival

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.781
was to stay on course
and retrieve the money.

01:21:47.871 --> 01:21:49.495
Alf, come on!

01:21:49.581 --> 01:21:53.994
First priority was to cut loose
the crew and sabotage the footage.

01:21:54.086 --> 01:21:55.462
We couldn't leave
any evidence behind.

01:21:55.547 --> 01:21:57.871
Come on, guys! It's time to go!

01:21:57.965 --> 01:22:01.252
Alf, go grab all the footage,
every tape you see. Come on!

01:22:01.345 --> 01:22:05.011
We gotta go find Locus Fender.
He knows exactly where the money is.

01:22:05.099 --> 01:22:09.559
We find the money, we return it to
Bishop, we're in the clear. Come on!

01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:13.518
I knew in my heart of hearts

01:22:13.608 --> 01:22:16.313
we should've stopped
when my goldfish died.

01:22:16.401 --> 01:22:18.976
It was a sign from a higher power.

01:22:20.115 --> 01:22:22.867
Alf!

01:22:24.328 --> 01:22:27.162
For fuck's sake, Alf!

01:22:30.538 --> 01:22:33.077
Where the fuck are the tapes?

01:23:03.784 --> 01:23:05.444
Based on Claremont's plan,

01:23:05.536 --> 01:23:08.703
we joined forces with
Lashandra and Lashindra.

01:23:10.917 --> 01:23:13.159
- You want a lap dance?
- Yeah.

01:23:13.253 --> 01:23:16.587
Tonight we have a 2-for-1 special
for these luscious tits.

01:23:16.673 --> 01:23:18.796
Luscious tits.

01:23:19.343 --> 01:23:21.715
Come on. Come on, baby.

01:23:33.192 --> 01:23:37.142
What's goin' on?
What the fuck?! I didn't do anything!

01:23:41.451 --> 01:23:45.366
I kicked ass at the fucking audition.
Seriously, I really was great.

01:23:49.083 --> 01:23:51.206
My agent called
and says that I'm too old.

01:23:59.554 --> 01:24:02.306
Ian, how you doing?
You all right? Yeah?

01:24:20.531 --> 01:24:22.987
Domino, Domino,
now, listen to me.

01:24:23.075 --> 01:24:25.365
The combination code is
tattooed on his right arm.

01:24:25.453 --> 01:24:27.991
You will never get inside
Edna Fender's safe

01:24:28.081 --> 01:24:32.329
unless you have the code breaker
on that arm. Understand?

01:24:32.419 --> 01:24:34.329
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:36.877
Listen, Edna's armed and dangerous...

01:24:36.966 --> 01:24:38.591
So don't fuck around.

01:24:38.676 --> 01:24:41.843
- What?
- Remove the right arm.

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:45.845
- You're breaking up.
- Domino, remove the right arm.

01:24:52.316 --> 01:24:56.065
Remove his shirt
from his upper right arm.

01:24:56.154 --> 01:25:00.021
You'll find the combination inside
the tattoo on his arm. You got me?

01:25:17.427 --> 01:25:19.798
What did he say?

01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:29.980
He said, "Remove the right arm."

01:26:49.651 --> 01:26:51.559
You're fuckin' crazy!

01:26:52.444 --> 01:26:53.773
Phew!

01:26:53.863 --> 01:26:56.817
My fuckin' arm!

01:27:14.843 --> 01:27:17.549
So, now we're back where we started.

01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:20.219
We sure are.

01:27:24.731 --> 01:27:28.859
Edna! You beautiful thing, come on out.

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:31.893
We found the money in the freezer.
It was all there.

01:27:39.243 --> 01:27:41.699
That's a lot to carry.

01:27:44.623 --> 01:27:49.084
How about a pot of coffee, Edna?
It's gonna be a long night.

01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:52.161
...part light-induced, part drug.

01:27:57.762 --> 01:28:03.005
Turned out Edna
had one last trick up her sleeve.

01:28:14.072 --> 01:28:16.564
Cocksuckers gonna pay.

01:28:20.454 --> 01:28:22.779
Mescaline.

01:28:23.957 --> 01:28:26.746
With each passing second,

01:28:26.836 --> 01:28:30.669
reality eclipsed
into the asphalt horizon.

01:28:34.219 --> 01:28:37.670
Soon, the mescaline was
pulsing through our veins.

01:28:40.184 --> 01:28:43.351
...pulsing through our veins.

01:29:43.542 --> 01:29:46.329
There is mescaline in your system,

01:29:46.419 --> 01:29:48.626
but I'm guessing it's nothing new.

01:29:49.381 --> 01:29:51.956
It's not unusual for someone like you...

01:29:54.804 --> 01:29:57.342
pampered her whole life...

01:29:58.725 --> 01:30:02.853
to indulge in drugs
as a coping mechanism.

01:30:05.857 --> 01:30:08.563
Not living up to your expectations.

01:30:10.322 --> 01:30:13.323
Certainly not up to your mother's.

01:30:13.993 --> 01:30:16.400
You know you're a heartbreak to her,
don’t you?

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:20.199
Now the bitch
was getting personal.

01:30:42.816 --> 01:30:45.388
You lost everything that belongs to you.

01:30:45.484 --> 01:30:47.643
You can take responsibility for it, or not.

01:30:47.737 --> 01:30:51.317
Either way, you've got
no one to blame but yourself.

01:32:32.678 --> 01:32:34.967
Hey, there's someone coming.

01:32:44.608 --> 01:32:46.435
Hey!

01:32:47.277 --> 01:32:49.353
David!

01:32:54.328 --> 01:32:55.906
We need help.

01:32:55.997 --> 01:32:59.496
Miracles. You're all miracles.

01:32:59.583 --> 01:33:01.909
Thank you! Thank God!

01:33:24.151 --> 01:33:26.274
What's your name?

01:33:27.155 --> 01:33:29.147
Domino.

01:33:36.833 --> 01:33:39.406
I know you.

01:33:42.797 --> 01:33:44.874
You're the angel of fire.

01:33:44.967 --> 01:33:47.174
Angel of fire.

01:33:50.055 --> 01:33:51.715
I know you.

01:33:51.807 --> 01:33:54.678
You burn bright enough
to know there are certain sacrifices

01:33:54.769 --> 01:33:57.342
that need to be made.

01:34:03.487 --> 01:34:07.355
You see, if you don't give back
the money, you all will die.

01:34:09.784 --> 01:34:14.609
And you will die contorted,
and you will die unforgiven.

01:34:14.703 --> 01:34:19.662
You see, there's... there's this...
this puzzle,

01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:22.871
and at the centre of this puzzle,
there's a child,

01:34:22.963 --> 01:34:25.501
and this is a very sick child.

01:34:25.591 --> 01:34:27.880
Avery sick child.

01:34:31.054 --> 01:34:34.507
But this child will be
a great leader someday.

01:34:34.601 --> 01:34:37.270
Do you know the child I speak of?

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.812
Yes.

01:34:40.565 --> 01:34:45.607
Well, you have only one destiny,
and that destiny is...

01:34:46.905 --> 01:34:51.532
that you must offer your lives
in exchange for the life of the child.

01:34:52.161 --> 01:34:54.070
Then, and only then,

01:34:54.163 --> 01:34:57.783
will you truly be cleansed
in the blood of the lamb.

01:35:09.139 --> 01:35:11.297
Take us to Vegas.

01:35:48.766 --> 01:35:50.588
It's official.

01:35:51.556 --> 01:35:54.177
Bishop whacked Frances and Chuckie.

01:35:57.312 --> 01:36:00.764
- What's our options?
- What's your options?

01:36:06.531 --> 01:36:08.025
Kill them.

01:36:08.116 --> 01:36:11.235
When?

01:36:14.372 --> 01:36:16.829
- When?
- Tonight!

01:36:16.917 --> 01:36:18.577
Kill them all.

01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:20.792
Kill them all tonight!

01:36:24.092 --> 01:36:25.670
Go! Go!

01:36:25.761 --> 01:36:28.003
Let's go! Move it out!

01:36:39.818 --> 01:36:43.732
You know, we discovered the bodies
early this morning.

01:36:44.989 --> 01:36:46.863
The FBI was lying.

01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:49.786
The guys we nabbed
weren't dead after all.

01:37:00.298 --> 01:37:03.964
Please, I just supply them with pussy.

01:37:04.052 --> 01:37:07.304
I justwant to get people high, man.

01:37:08.767 --> 01:37:10.641
Fuck 'em. They don't know.

01:37:39.713 --> 01:37:41.790
Fuck, this shit's intense.

01:37:41.883 --> 01:37:45.002
Ian, just do what they say.
I don’t feel like getting killed.

01:37:45.094 --> 01:37:47.217
We need you to book us
a hotel suite.

01:37:47.305 --> 01:37:50.057
- What, with my money?
- Put it on your credit card.

01:37:50.141 --> 01:37:53.841
Are you serious?
OK, don't look at me that way.

01:38:08.619 --> 01:38:10.279
- This is Bishop.
- Mr Bishop,

01:38:10.371 --> 01:38:13.326
the bounty hunters have arrived.
Where do you want to meet?

01:38:13.416 --> 01:38:17.117
Top of the World at the Stratosphere.
Yeah, it's completely secure.

01:38:17.212 --> 01:38:22.171
We'll drop off the money in exactly
one hour. Should we say, 7pm?

01:38:22.259 --> 01:38:23.802
Yeah, good.

01:38:23.886 --> 01:38:29.095
We'll drop off the money in exactly
one hour. Should we say, 7pm?

01:38:29.185 --> 01:38:32.885
All right, boys, we're in business.

01:38:37.902 --> 01:38:41.567
We could let Cigliutti think
that the kids are still dead.

01:38:41.656 --> 01:38:45.701
Yeah, and then we can flush out
Cigliutti in the money exchange.

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:48.158
Yeah!

01:38:50.332 --> 01:38:53.333
Wilson...
They're on the move.

01:39:00.509 --> 01:39:01.589
Yeah, what?

01:39:01.677 --> 01:39:04.715
Yeah, Mr Cigliutti, the money exchange
with Drake Bishop

01:39:04.807 --> 01:39:09.965
will occur on the top floor suite of
the Stratosphere at exactly 7pm.

01:39:11.394 --> 01:39:15.722
Sounds like we got a negro
Deep Throat here. Right?

01:39:18.651 --> 01:39:21.225
Man, we are so fucked.

01:39:22.531 --> 01:39:26.030
Yeah, well, that guy said
we were fucked either way.

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:38.541
- Hello?
- Domino...

01:39:38.631 --> 01:39:43.543
the money exchange will take place
at Top of the World, Stratosphere.

01:39:43.637 --> 01:39:46.722
And I need you
to get there right at 7pm.

01:39:48.059 --> 01:39:52.852
I'm sorry it turned out like this.
I won’t forget this, Domino.

01:40:23.472 --> 01:40:25.678
Get off.

01:40:29.688 --> 01:40:31.765
Lateesha.

01:40:32.775 --> 01:40:35.526
What the fuck have you gotten us into?

01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:39.276
Claremont negotiated a finder’s fee
for $300,000.

01:40:39.365 --> 01:40:41.856
He fucked it up
'cause he tried to take all of it.

01:40:41.951 --> 01:40:44.953
- Bullshit. You set us up.
- Fuck you.

01:40:51.082 --> 01:40:54.748
Domino, if I could take it all back,
I would.

01:40:56.003 --> 01:40:59.289
Well, they're gonna kill us
if we don't deliver all the money.

01:41:09.645 --> 01:41:13.346
$300,000, and I need to collect
that fee right now.

01:41:14.817 --> 01:41:18.400
It'll pay for my baby's entire operation.

01:41:19.113 --> 01:41:21.356
Please.

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:39.378
Alf, what the fuck
are you doing in there?!

01:41:39.469 --> 01:41:40.879
Alf!

01:41:42.764 --> 01:41:46.512
Wanker, cut the drama.
I need 300k from one of the bags.

01:42:13.757 --> 01:42:15.915
I love you, Domino.

01:42:16.009 --> 01:42:17.586
Thank you.

01:42:41.867 --> 01:42:45.948
This is your last chance. Once I walk
out that door, I can't help you.

01:42:47.623 --> 01:42:50.161
You have a fondness for tattoos.

01:42:53.129 --> 01:42:56.463
You've been staring
at my goldfish all afternoon.

01:42:57.926 --> 01:43:00.002
It's a koi, actually.

01:43:00.095 --> 01:43:02.337
The Japanese refer
to them as shiro muji,

01:43:02.431 --> 01:43:05.183
which, translated, means "white...

01:43:06.102 --> 01:43:08.307
and nothing else."

01:43:10.481 --> 01:43:13.519
Do you know why I really
became a bounty hunter?

01:43:14.112 --> 01:43:16.603
Because of cunts like me?

01:43:20.451 --> 01:43:24.366
It kills you that
while I'm coming into my own,

01:43:24.456 --> 01:43:27.457
you're stuck
in some dead-end marriage.

01:43:27.542 --> 01:43:30.115
Or, worse yet, an unfulfilling job.

01:43:30.211 --> 01:43:32.834
I'm not married.

01:43:33.382 --> 01:43:36.218
And I love my job.

01:43:37.804 --> 01:43:39.926
Where are you hiding your tattoo?

01:43:40.014 --> 01:43:41.638
Is it on your ankle?

01:43:41.724 --> 01:43:44.595
No. Or is it somewhere else?

01:43:44.686 --> 01:43:47.260
Is it somewhere nasty?

01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:51.351
I'm picturing something...
picturing something delicate,

01:43:51.443 --> 01:43:54.979
like a rose, or... or a hummingbird.

01:43:55.073 --> 01:43:57.825
Or, no. Maybe it's the name of a man

01:43:57.910 --> 01:44:00.234
that you can't bring home to Daddy.

01:44:03.875 --> 01:44:05.832
No.

01:44:05.919 --> 01:44:09.168
No, I'm completely wrong,
aren't I, Taryn?

01:44:09.255 --> 01:44:10.626
God.

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:13.961
See, I bet... I'm thinking...

01:44:14.048 --> 01:44:17.666
that when you go to sleep
alone tonight...

01:44:18.844 --> 01:44:21.217
it's my pussy you'll be dreaming of.

01:44:21.848 --> 01:44:23.757
Really?

01:46:03.623 --> 01:46:05.166
Brian...

01:46:05.876 --> 01:46:07.750
I love you, bro.

01:46:49.173 --> 01:46:51.546
Welcome to the Top of the World.

01:46:56.014 --> 01:46:59.265
It's a little out of the way,
but, very private.

01:47:02.604 --> 01:47:04.762
Where have I seen
you two boys before?

01:47:04.856 --> 01:47:06.814
We're actors.

01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:08.775
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:47:08.862 --> 01:47:12.277
- We're celebrity hostages.
- Celebrity hostages?

01:47:12.365 --> 01:47:14.856
Yeah. Apparently, people
don't kill other people

01:47:14.951 --> 01:47:17.656
when celebrities are around.

01:47:18.414 --> 01:47:20.537
Brings too much attention.

01:47:21.668 --> 01:47:23.410
I see.

01:47:23.502 --> 01:47:27.371
Well, I'd better have you
escorted downstairs, then.

01:47:45.648 --> 01:47:48.221
You got lucky.

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:03.913
Go! Let's go!

01:48:15.514 --> 01:48:17.638
And you're a...

01:48:18.059 --> 01:48:20.301
a bounty hunter.

01:48:25.942 --> 01:48:29.062
- Yes, I am.
- Dangerous profession.

01:48:32.241 --> 01:48:34.399
Sometimes.

01:48:40.375 --> 01:48:42.452
Will maintain visual contact...

01:48:42.545 --> 01:48:46.043
Will maintain visual contact with
the tactical team that's on location.

01:48:47.674 --> 01:48:51.720
Could you... could you be
a little bit more specific about that?

01:48:54.182 --> 01:48:58.096
It can be dangerous when you don't
know what to expect from a situation.

01:49:06.362 --> 01:49:10.736
When you have absolutely no idea
what could possibly happen next.

01:49:19.204 --> 01:49:22.790
The bags contain the 10million,
minus the $300,000 finder's fee

01:49:22.877 --> 01:49:25.035
you negotiated with Claremont.

01:49:25.462 --> 01:49:30.837
Well, now, that's...
that's what I call bold, Miss Harvey.

01:49:31.302 --> 01:49:34.552
But I'm impressed.
I'm very impressed.

01:49:34.638 --> 01:49:36.263
Go!

01:49:42.857 --> 01:49:47.602
All right, gentlemen, let's make sure that
those bags are packed with my money,

01:49:47.695 --> 01:49:51.396
and we'll let these bounty hunters go.

01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:53.614
Your money's gone.

01:49:55.954 --> 01:49:57.863
What?

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:03.827
What are you talking about?

01:50:03.922 --> 01:50:07.088
It has been sent
to help free Afghanistan.

01:50:07.175 --> 01:50:08.717
Let us go.

01:50:10.387 --> 01:50:13.223
- Let us go.
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:50:22.233 --> 01:50:24.143
It's a bomb!

01:50:46.552 --> 01:50:48.960
OK, drop the weapons!

01:50:56.642 --> 01:51:01.351
- You killed my sons.
- I didn't kill your sons.

01:51:01.814 --> 01:51:04.650
I'm not in the people-killing business.

01:51:10.365 --> 01:51:11.445
No!

01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:35.893
Alf!

01:51:37.437 --> 01:51:41.482
- What the fuck's going on up there?
- Get somebody in there!

01:52:01.546 --> 01:52:04.216
Mayday, mayday. This is Victor Bravo.
We're going down.

01:52:06.927 --> 01:52:08.885
Repeat, I'm going down.

01:52:12.017 --> 01:52:13.975
Heads, you live.

01:52:14.687 --> 01:52:16.644
Tails, you die.

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:20.641
Tails, you die.

01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:27.233
Tails, you die.

01:52:44.215 --> 01:52:46.920
Move back, for fuck's sake!

01:52:57.271 --> 01:52:59.144
No!

01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:39.227
Come on, Alf!

01:54:00.715 --> 01:54:02.209
I make...

01:54:04.135 --> 01:54:07.340
I make everything... OK.

01:54:11.432 --> 01:54:13.508
My coin was tossed.

01:54:13.601 --> 01:54:16.223
50/50 chance.

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.174
Put it down, or I'll blow
your fuckin' brains out!

01:54:56.148 --> 01:54:57.976
Fuckin' shoot him!

01:55:19.632 --> 01:55:23.083
I once vowed never to invest
too much emotion into anyone.

01:55:23.177 --> 01:55:25.585
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:55:30.267 --> 01:55:32.511
I love you, Choco.

01:55:38.904 --> 01:55:42.189
50/50 chance. Life or death.

01:55:42.282 --> 01:55:43.776
Heads, you live.

01:55:43.867 --> 01:55:45.943
Tails, you die.

01:55:53.165 --> 01:55:55.074
My destiny was life.

01:55:59.422 --> 01:56:01.497
When I was a little girl,

01:56:01.590 --> 01:56:04.164
my mum took me to Las Vegas.

01:56:06.471 --> 01:56:10.220
She told me that it was the most
dangerous place on earth.

01:56:32.291 --> 01:56:35.411
Miss Harvey, I suggest you retire.

01:56:36.712 --> 01:56:38.753
Sweet dreams, Miss Mills.

01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:43.004
My name is Domino Harvey.

01:56:44.304 --> 01:56:46.630
I am a bounty hunter.

01:56:49.477 --> 01:56:54.270
I know that my Eddie and Choco are
staring down at me from the afterlife.

01:56:57.153 --> 01:57:00.985
I now feel a sense of relief
that we will meet again.

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.750
Mum...

01:57:14.838 --> 01:57:16.748
I love you.

01:57:23.472 --> 01:57:26.307
There are three kinds of people
in the world...

01:57:28.228 --> 01:57:30.513
The rich...

01:57:39.654 --> 01:57:41.611
The poor...

01:57:55.295 --> 01:57:57.703
And everyone in between.

01:58:01.845 --> 01:58:05.178
- I'm Dr Walton.
- Mr Williams.

01:58:05.890 --> 01:58:08.216
Kee Kee Rodriguez.

01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:10.386
- I'm her mother, Lateesha.
- We're her cousins.

01:58:10.479 --> 01:58:11.724
First cousins.

01:58:11.813 --> 01:58:15.680
It seems that we
have a few things we have to look at.

01:58:16.736 --> 01:58:18.860
If you're wondering
what's true and what isn't,

01:58:18.947 --> 01:58:22.483
fuck off, because it's
none of your goddamn business.

01:58:22.576 --> 01:58:25.327
I'll never tell you what it all meant.

01:58:25.412 --> 01:58:28.247
I'll never tell you
what it all meant.

01:58:29.375 --> 01:58:33.419
All that matters is
that my mission is complete.

01:58:44.224 --> 01:58:46.051
I saved her.

01:58:49.187 --> 01:58:50.848
And when she is older...

01:58:52.984 --> 01:58:54.644
A woman named Domino will tell her

01:58:54.735 --> 01:58:58.687
that there is only one
conclusion to every story...

01:59:00.159 --> 01:59:02.650
We all fall down.

02:00:24.331 --> 02:00:27.082
My name is Domino Harvey.

02:00:37.595 --> 02:00:40.133
Heads, you live.

02:00:40.223 --> 02:00:42.430
Tails, you die.

02:00:43.305 --> 02:00:49.582
