00:02.169 --> 00:03.878
A hot pot. I love it.

00:04.046 --> 00:06.205
I can just see myself at Adams,
boiling water.

00:06.381 --> 00:09.087
You know what would make
a really great graduation gift?

00:09.259 --> 00:10.968
A Mr. Microphone.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.545
Yeah, if you've gotten
every other gift in the world.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.129
[DING]

00:15.432 --> 00:18.802
Hey, the toaster. I bet it's a present
from the Other Realm.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.562
It's stuck.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.355
Probably snagged
on my cheese toast.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.066
You're not supposed to melt stuff

00:24.233 --> 00:26.475
in our delicate
Other Realm communication system.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.692
It's just a bagel and a little cheese.

00:32.281 --> 00:36.744
Okay, a bagel and a wheel of cheese.
Same difference.

Okay, the towels are changed,
the soap dispensers are filled,

01:14.616 --> 01:16.242
and the urinal cakes are replaced.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.447
This is how I keep people
from knowing I like you best.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.615
Including me.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.703
Well, Skippy.

01:24.877 --> 01:27.250
Come to spend some of that
hard-earned paper-route money?

01:27.421 --> 01:31.040
Tough talk for a college junior
who still attends high school proms.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.625
Harvey, can't you guys be nice?

01:33.802 --> 01:37.848
- No. He likes you, Sabrina.
- Right, we're friends.

01:38.015 --> 01:41.764
But he's hoping for girlfriend.
I don't like you spending time with him.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.763
And I bet
if the shoe were on the other foot--

01:43.937 --> 01:47.023
Hey, I have never once been jealous
of you and Josh.

01:47.232 --> 01:51.979
Sabrina, I don't ask for much.
Quit this job, please? Do it for me.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.942
Harvey, that's not fair.
I like Josh, and nothing is going on.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.445
And I need this job.

01:57.326 --> 02:00.197
- That was an awfully long no.
- Harvey.

02:03.665 --> 02:08.624
Great, a fight with my boyfriend
and I smell like Comet.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.212
You know, you're like the evil version
of the Maytag Repairman.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.254
What? I needed the calcium.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.472
Zellie, have you decided what you're
gonna get Sabrina for graduation?

02:19.640 --> 02:23.508
Oh, I haven't had time to think about it.
I've been too busy handling this lawsuit

02:23.685 --> 02:25.893
Willard has filed against you
for hitting his car.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.056
- Oh, yeah, that.
- Yeah, that.

02:28.232 --> 02:32.182
Speaking of that, have you seen a
notarised witness statement? It's pink.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.527
Found it.

[LAUGHS]

02:39.201 --> 02:40.696
Who's in trouble now?

02:41.537 --> 02:42.700
Harvey's being unreasonable.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.197
I don't know why he doesn't want me
hanging out with Josh.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.913
- He must not trust me.
- That is so sad.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.209
I think there's only one thing
you can do.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.622
Open another present.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.456
Is it a Mr. Microphone?
Is it a Mr. Microphone?

02:55.926 --> 02:57.635
No, it's luggage.

02:59.429 --> 03:03.380
- Oh, come right in.
- Is Zelda here?

03:03.559 --> 03:07.723
No, she's out at a meeting getting
her seven-day free-of-Willard chip.

03:08.981 --> 03:13.976
Well, my car is fixed.
It actually goes in reverse now.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.736
So I want to inform you
that I am dropping the lawsuit.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.529
Isn't it too bad they haven't invented
the telephone yet?

03:21.535 --> 03:25.913
- Will you please give these to Zelda?
- Will do.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.589
I've just hit Willard.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.843
I am so suing.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.509
You know, I've always liked this place.
It'll be fun owning it.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.635
I didn't hit you hard.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.225
What was he doing here?

03:50.397 --> 03:53.066
Oh, he came by
to drop some lawsuit.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.105
You know, I have no problem at all
with Harvey and Josh being friends.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.355
Were your friends
operating under a price limit

03:58.530 --> 04:01.105
- when they got you all these things?
- Hey, I found something.

04:01.283 --> 04:04.486
"If two enemies break bread together,
they will no longer be enemies."

04:04.661 --> 04:06.785
I'm gonna bake
some friendship bread.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.949
Here's my gift. A magic mirror.

04:11.126 --> 04:15.125
Oh, yeah. You can't get
this kind of plastic just anywhere.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.666

It's what it does.

- Case closed.
- Chickie B?

Mm-hm.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.221
I don't get it, Kinkle.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.317
If you can't stand this guy Josh,
why do you keep coming back here?

04:36.485 --> 04:39.522
I gotta keep my eye on
Mr. I-Can't-Find-a-Girl-My-Own-Age.

Don't worry,
I plan to keep a really low profile.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.747
- Oh, hey, have you seen Sabrina?
- Keep away from my girlfriend.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.121
I'll stay away from Sabrina
when she tells me to.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.293
Maybe she did tell you to but you're
starting to forget things, Grandpa.

Hey, look, fresh-baked bread
from my ever-loving oven.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.379
- I'm game.
- Maybe you should leave.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.460
- Maybe you should make me.
- It's got raisins.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.463
Oh, raisins.

Look at them. This bread
could have kept The Beatles together.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.657
Admit it. I got Sabrina the best gift.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.195
I don't know how you can compare
a specially brewed homemade scent

05:28.370 --> 05:30.494
with a snotty-talking looking glass.

that I didn't.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.173
Oh, I see your vile little plan.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.006
You break our gifts
with the childish hope

05:47.181 --> 05:49.850
that we will then
buy Sabrina a Mr. Microphone.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.138
Yeah, it's so obvious. A mister what?

05:53.312 --> 05:56.729

Oh, you are in for it, buster.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.935
Not only did you break
irreplaceable items,

06:01.111 --> 06:03.069
but you've now freed
the man in the mirror.

we both share a love of turkey jerky.

we're getting into a bad area here,

07:01.964 --> 07:03.708
I had that thought first.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.710
You know,
maybe we're focused on the presents

07:05.884 --> 07:07.925
because we don't wanna focus
on the reality.

Instead of competing,

11:48.292 --> 11:50.700
we'll come up with a present
for Sabrina that we both like,

11:50.878 --> 11:52.289
and go in on it together.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.168
Perfect. I bet my gift ideas
are better than yours.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.418
- Sorry.
- I hate to interrupt

11:58.594 --> 12:00.836
conversations of genius,

12:01.430 --> 12:06.722
but may I say, you two vexing beauties
are radiating brilliance.

Salem, you're still gonna be punished.
Don't try buttering us up.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.351
Don't be ridiculous.

12:11.523 --> 12:16.566
Everyone knows butter only belongs
on lovely finger sandwiches.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.730
Follow me.

12:20.616 --> 12:24.911
- High tea from me to thee.
- Oh, my.

12:25.537 --> 12:29.453
Oh, don't we have a fine time,
the three of us?

12:31.460 --> 12:34.545
Go, Harvey. Go, Josh. Go, team.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.707
It's sweet of you
to root for both of them.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.837
That way, you don't have to feel guilty
at the loser's funeral.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.300
No offence, zebra boy,
but these are young guys.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.634
Unless one of your obstacles

12:43.805 --> 12:46.642
is a piece of delectable-looking cake
laced with anthrax,

- this course is not gonna kill them.
- Don't worry. Sudden death will.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.275
Okay, I appear to be standing
in some sort of primordial ooze

12:57.444 --> 13:00.363
- in my good shoes. What is this stuff?
- Quicksand.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.157
Ah!

13:02.491 --> 13:04.817
It wouldn't be sporting
if you had magic.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.829
You know what? I changed my mind.
I'd like to drop this course.

You relax. One sudden move
and I'm chugging a sand smoothie.

Help, Harvey. Josh.

Have no fear, Sabrina.
I'm on my way.

Hey, Dudley Do-Right called.
He wants his dialogue back.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.806
Sabrina, I'll be right there.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.012
Okay, that might hold them up.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.516
Is there anything more delightful

13:32.688 --> 13:35.394
than a perfect cup of Darjeeling
served in bone china?

13:35.566 --> 13:39.351
Not to mention the civility
of corn relish on toast points.

13:39.862 --> 13:43.362
How marvellous.
And I did it all myself.

Okay, which one of you two
left the backdoor open?

13:56.962 --> 13:58.706
I hope everything was to your liking.

for this kind of beauty treatment.

Hey, maybe I can stop the blades
with this.

the perfect graduation present.

Let's put the keys in a little box,
and then put that box in a bigger box,

15:01.860 --> 15:03.439
and then put that box--

15:04.154 --> 15:05.649
Now I've lost my train of thought.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.610
Oh, Willard.
Glad to see you up and about.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.615
I assume you're here
to serve papers.

No, I'm dropping the lawsuit. I...

Zelda, we've been through too much
together to have it end this way.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.921
And my lawyer took my retainer
and went to Tonga.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.053
- Oh, thank you, Willard.
- No, no, no.

a bottom to this bottomless pit. Hurry.

I should have gone out for track.

If I don't convince the aunties soon
that I've really turned over a new leaf,

I'm gonna be tossed out into the cold
