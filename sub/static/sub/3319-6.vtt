big advice?

your daughter,

05:56.356 --> 05:57.400
who came to me
instead of you...

06:00.534 --> 06:01.883
...that if she
really wants

06:01.970 --> 06:03.406
something meaningful
with this guy,

06:03.493 --> 06:05.887
she shouldn't
have sex with him

06:05.974 --> 06:07.671
for at least
three months.

06:07.758 --> 06:08.324

he can't deliver the goods?

06:22.033 --> 06:25.210
True intimacy doesn't depend
on "delivering the goods."

06:25.297 --> 06:26.995
Oh, Marjorie.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.953
You make me sad.

don't go slow.

there's something

worth waiting for.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.112

supposed to do?

not bad advice.

to hire a new pastry
chef right away.

Yes. These areyour jeans.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.656
No. I just need
some advice about Luke.

10:13.743 --> 10:16.354
Oh. Really?

10:16.441 --> 10:20.750
You want to talk
to your old mom?

10:20.837 --> 10:22.709
That's great.
So, what's going on?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.798
Ever since he found out
I'm pregnant,

10:24.885 --> 10:27.365
he's afraid
to have sex with me.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.893
Huh.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.809
What else is going on?

10:35.896 --> 10:37.245
Nothing. That's it.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.987
He's scared
he's gonna hurt the baby.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.554
Right.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.121
Sure.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.557
So...

10:45.645 --> 10:48.125
So, uh...

10:48.212 --> 10:52.347
I guess you could
explain to Luke that...

10:52.434 --> 10:54.436
there are certain...

10:59.093 --> 11:01.051
...sexual...

11:01.138 --> 11:03.401
positions, um...

11:03.488 --> 11:06.709
which would
allow him to...

11:06.796 --> 11:07.579
I can't do this!

11:07.667 --> 11:09.799
Google it!

11:13.020 --> 11:15.283
I'm so glad
we can talk like this.

11:20.767 --> 11:24.858
Hey, um, we're still
going slow, right?

11:24.945 --> 11:26.294
Yeah.
Okay.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.035
But even if we weren't,

11:28.122 --> 11:29.471
I'm not doing it
in the freakin' woods.

11:29.558 --> 11:33.301
Right.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.304
[thunder crashes]

11:36.391 --> 11:38.567
Oh, that's not good.

11:38.654 --> 11:39.655
We have time to get
back, don't we?

11:39.742 --> 11:43.572
Um...

11:43.659 --> 11:45.095
No.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.713
Hello?

11:53.800 --> 11:54.975
Hey, I don't think
anybody's home.

11:55.062 --> 11:55.932
Wait here.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.020
Where are you going?

11:57.107 --> 11:58.500
Just wait!

12:00.110 --> 12:01.721
[glass breaks]

12:03.853 --> 12:05.637
Come on in!

12:05.725 --> 12:09.554
I'm not really comfortable
with breaking and entering.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.948
For you, it's just entering.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.560
It's a good point.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.999
You're luring me
into a life of crime here.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.044
Oh, don't worry.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.872
If the owners come back,
we'll just kill 'em.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.268
You know how
to make a fire?

12:27.355 --> 12:31.489
Do I know how to make a fire?

12:34.536 --> 12:35.580
You gotta admit, though,

12:35.667 --> 12:38.453
cabin in the woods, rainy night.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.541
It's kind of romantic.

12:39.628 --> 12:43.414
Yes, yes, it is.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.633
Excuse me.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.468
Hi, Marjorie?

12:53.555 --> 12:54.295
It's Christy.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.687
So, listen,

12:55.775 --> 12:59.300
I think God wants me
to get laid.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.745
It's too bad we don't have
any marshmallows.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.965
Oh, but we do.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.576
Really?

13:14.663 --> 13:15.533
That's right.
A good Scout never leaves home

13:15.620 --> 13:17.840
without a s'mores kit.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.712
Do you want...?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.671
Uh, no, maybe later.

13:24.281 --> 13:28.329
Uh! It is really
comfy here.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.810
Yeah, yeah.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.554
Are you mad at me?

13:36.641 --> 13:39.427
Why would I be mad at you?

13:39.514 --> 13:42.996
I don't know.
'Cause we're not
taking advantage

13:43.083 --> 13:43.648
of the comfy-ness.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.522
Is that an option?

13:47.609 --> 13:49.698
No, it's not.
I checked.

13:51.743 --> 13:52.919
Are youokay?

13:53.006 --> 13:56.400
Yeah, yeah,
it's just not how

13:56.487 --> 13:57.662
I usually do things.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.143
What does that mean?

14:00.230 --> 14:03.755
Well, in the past,
I would jump into bed

14:03.843 --> 14:07.063
with a guy right away
'cause I was afraid

14:07.150 --> 14:10.675
if I didn't,
he'd... leave.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.591
Why the heck
would anyone leave you?

14:13.678 --> 14:15.985
You're-you're wonderful.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.253
I didn't think so.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.821
It's weird. I've never left
anyone I've slept with.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.175
What's this now?

14:32.262 --> 14:33.916
I always thought
it was such a miracle

14:34.003 --> 14:36.136
that a woman
would have sex with me,

14:36.223 --> 14:38.660
the least I could do was give
her the rest of my life.

14:38.747 --> 14:42.142
You didn't actually
say that to them?

14:42.229 --> 14:45.841
[scoffs] That's a mistake
you only make once.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.016
Unless you're me,

14:47.103 --> 14:48.757
and then you do it
every time.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.762
Yeah, you know, maybe
it's good that we're waiting.

14:53.849 --> 14:57.679
Yeah, maybe.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.861
This is nice.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.776
Sure is.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.999
Thank you for...

15:15.566 --> 15:17.829
being so understanding.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.616
You're welcome.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.226
I'm a lucky girl.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.837
Yep, very lucky.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.931
If you're curious,
I can just show it to you.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.851
I'm just saying,
I walked in on my parents

15:39.939 --> 15:42.680
having sex once
and it freaked me out.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.508
This is not the same
thing at all.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.162
No, it's worse.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.164
Our kid can't run out
of the room screaming.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.820
Hey!

15:51.907 --> 15:54.910
Mom, tell Luke
that he can't hurt the baby.

15:54.997 --> 15:59.088
Well, if I do that,
he'll have sex with you.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.568
Stick to your guns, buddy.

16:00.655 --> 16:01.873
[clicks tongue]

16:05.877 --> 16:07.836
I feel like
such an idiot!
Oh, honey,

16:07.923 --> 16:10.317
it's gonna be okay.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.797
No, it's not.
He's never gonna call.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.538
Oh, it's only been a week.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.106
Oh, wake up. If a man hasn't
called after three days,

16:17.193 --> 16:18.542
he might as well be dead.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.154
This is all your fault.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.590
What did I do?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.809
You told her
not to sleep with him,

16:24.896 --> 16:26.289
and he took a hike.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.943
Oh, hiking.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.945
You see that?

16:30.032 --> 16:33.601
She took your advice, not mine,
and now she's devastated. I win.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.820
Honey, it's good thing
you didn't sleep with him.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.518
He's a jerk.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.259
More bad advice.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.565
If she'd slept with him,
she'd own the jerk by now.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.176
And is that
what you'd want?

16:43.263 --> 16:44.568
What's her other option?

16:44.655 --> 16:46.266
I don't know, maybe
meet a nice guy.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.529
Oh, so when she cheats on him,
she's the jerk?

16:48.616 --> 16:50.574
Think it through, Marjorie.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.273
I'm gonna ignore you
because you're insane.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.362
Christy,

16:55.449 --> 16:56.841
if a man won't wait
until you're ready

16:56.928 --> 16:59.322
to share your secret garden,

16:59.409 --> 17:02.412
he's not worth
a second of your time.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.023
Secret garden?

17:06.895 --> 17:10.768
Holy Moses, how many cats
do you own?

17:11.769 --> 17:13.597
Four.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.557
[mouthing]

17:16.644 --> 17:18.646
[mocking]:
"Oh sure, Christy,

17:18.733 --> 17:22.998
I'm fine going slow 'cause I'm
never gonna call you anyway."

17:23.085 --> 17:26.393
Screw you, Scoutmaster!

17:26.480 --> 17:28.525
I never want to see
your stupid face again!

17:31.311 --> 17:33.922
I never want to see
your stupid face again!
What?

17:34.009 --> 17:35.750
If I'd known you
were such a jerk,

17:35.837 --> 17:37.839
I would've had sex with you
all over that cabin!

17:37.926 --> 17:40.276
Once again, what?

17:40.363 --> 17:41.886
Instead, I opened myself up
to you,

17:41.973 --> 17:43.801
I was totally vulnerable,
and I told you things

17:43.888 --> 17:45.194
that I never told anybody else!

17:45.281 --> 17:46.891
And what do you do?
You blow me off!

17:46.978 --> 17:48.284
Wait, hold on.
I didn't blow you off.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.590
You blew meoff.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.374
No, no, no, no!
You were the one

17:51.461 --> 17:53.333
who did the blowing-- the
blowing was done by you!

17:53.420 --> 17:55.552
Christy, did you ever get
the flowers?

17:55.639 --> 17:57.598
What flowers?

17:57.685 --> 17:59.774
The ones I dropped off
at the restaurant

17:59.861 --> 18:00.905
the day after we went hiking.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.778
You sent me flowers?

18:03.865 --> 18:07.956
Roses. With a note saying,
"I hike you."

18:11.525 --> 18:12.874
Aw.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.136
And when I didn't hear back
from you,

18:14.223 --> 18:15.442
I figured
you just weren't into me.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.139
I never got them.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.619
That's weird. I dropped 'em off

18:18.706 --> 18:20.142
with a pasty-faced guy
in a nice suit.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.012
He promised me
he'd give 'em to you.

18:27.323 --> 18:27.976
I hike you, too.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.806
Where are you going?

18:31.893 --> 18:33.677
I'd tell you, but I know

18:33.764 --> 18:34.287
that you're squeamish
about homicide.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.202
Call me!

18:40.380 --> 18:42.860
Where are my
freaking flowers?

18:42.947 --> 18:45.689
What are you talking about?

18:45.776 --> 18:46.908
Don't screw with me!

18:46.995 --> 18:48.475
Adam said he
dropped 'em off

18:48.562 --> 18:50.129
with a pasty-faced guy
in a nice suit.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.043
Nice suit, pasty face!

18:54.089 --> 18:57.658
I prefer fair-skinned, but okay.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.268
Where are they?!

18:59.355 --> 19:00.313
Look, I know I should've
given them to you,

19:00.400 --> 19:03.359
but I just got so jealous.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.492
Tell me!Oh, boy.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.494
This is awkward.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.365
You remember how you advised me

19:09.452 --> 19:13.064
that I should work
on my relationship with my wife?

19:13.152 --> 19:16.111
You gave my flowers
to your wife?

19:16.198 --> 19:18.069
If it makes you feel any better,

19:18.157 --> 19:19.070
she still wouldn't sleep
with me.

19:21.725 --> 19:22.639
[clears throat]

19:22.726 --> 19:24.032
What's this?

19:24.119 --> 19:24.946
What do you think it is?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.165
Oh.

19:38.046 --> 19:41.005
I owe you an apology.
This is delicious.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.018
So, when are you seeing
the Boy Scout again?

19:54.105 --> 19:56.804
Next Saturday.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.022
We're going fly-fishing.

19:58.109 --> 20:02.462
Whatever the hell that is.

20:02.549 --> 20:06.205
Your secret garden
still on lockdown?

20:06.292 --> 20:10.252
If you mean am I choosing
to delay gratification

20:10.339 --> 20:11.035
to ensure an emotionally
fulfilling relationship,

20:11.122 --> 20:13.081
then yes.

20:13.168 --> 20:16.040
And I don't want
to talk about it.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.260
Fine. What about you?

20:18.347 --> 20:22.656
Your boyfriend still afraid he's
gonna poke the baby's eye out?

20:24.614 --> 20:26.355
He happens to be

20:26.442 --> 20:29.358
a very sensitive
and considerate guy. And...

20:29.445 --> 20:31.360
I don't want to talk
about it either.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.410
All right. If no one's gonna ask
about me,

20:37.497 --> 20:39.238
I'll just tell you.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.327
I went home with a vice cop
last night

20:41.414 --> 20:43.329
and, yes, I do want
to talk about it.
