WEBVTT

00:01.914 --> 00:04.003
â™ª â™ª

00:08.138 --> 00:09.705
Hey, uh... where are we?

00:09.792 --> 00:11.533
I thought you were
driving me home.
Oh, I am.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.230
I just took
a little detour

00:13.317 --> 00:13.926
to give you a taste of
what I do for a living.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.885
[exhales]

00:15.972 --> 00:17.321
See that
stop sign?

00:17.408 --> 00:18.801
Yeah.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.020
As a Sonoma County
civil engineer,

00:20.107 --> 00:22.457
I processed the paperwork

00:22.544 --> 00:23.066
that made that stop sign
a reality.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.374
Very impressive.
Yeah.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.854
City council was pushing
for a light,

00:28.941 --> 00:30.291
but I didn't think
the traffic flow

00:30.378 --> 00:31.901
justified the expense
to the taxpayers.

00:31.988 --> 00:35.296
Well, as someone
who recently started

00:35.383 --> 00:36.036
paying taxes,
I thank you.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.214
How 'bout that yield sign?

00:40.301 --> 00:41.519
What a beauty.
Is that you?

00:41.606 --> 00:43.043
Nah.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.393
That was another guy
in my office.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.176
Brett.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.309
Such a jerk.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.269
Well, you know what?

00:52.356 --> 00:54.445
I think the stop sign's
much nicer.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.012
Right?

00:56.099 --> 00:58.145
Thank you.
Yeah.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.929
Hey, maybe
next time, um,

01:00.016 --> 01:01.365
we can drive
to Petaluma.

01:01.452 --> 01:02.584
I'll show you
a traffic circle there

01:02.671 --> 01:05.108
that will
blow your mind.

01:05.194 --> 01:06.805
I'd like that.

01:14.639 --> 01:15.988
Hey, um...

01:16.076 --> 01:17.903
I gotta run
something by you.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.340
Sure.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.037
I like you.

01:21.124 --> 01:21.951
Good, I like you.

01:22.038 --> 01:24.388
Yeah?

01:24.475 --> 01:26.434
I don't show my stop
sign to just anyone.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.439
Anyway, I...

01:31.526 --> 01:33.571
I want to take this
real slow.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.660
That's fine.
You sure?

01:35.747 --> 01:36.096
Yeah, of course.

01:38.924 --> 01:39.447
How slow?

01:39.534 --> 01:42.711
[laughs]

01:42.798 --> 01:43.973
Until we get to know
each other better,

01:44.060 --> 01:47.281
sex is off the table.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.283
And any other furniture.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.067
Okay.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.201
[laughs]

01:54.288 --> 01:55.985
Wow.
What?

01:56.072 --> 01:58.205
I've said that
to other men before,

01:58.292 --> 02:00.207
but I never actually meant it.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.861
Should I feel special?

02:02.948 --> 02:04.124
Yeah, yes.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.256
You should.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.565
Question:

02:10.651 --> 02:12.175
do you like
to hike?

02:12.262 --> 02:13.872
'Cause I was thinking
maybe next Saturday

02:13.959 --> 02:15.265
I'd take you to
this beautiful trail.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.745
It's about an hour
north of here.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.050
Yeah, sure.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.357
Just a heads up:

02:20.444 --> 02:22.011
I'm-I'm a bit of
a nature buff.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.273
It's kind of
my thing.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.535
Camping, fishing,

02:24.622 --> 02:26.320
rock climbing,
you name it.

02:26.407 --> 02:27.408
[distantly]:
If it's outdoors...

02:27.495 --> 02:30.367
[grunting, panting]

02:30.454 --> 02:33.979
[Christy moaning]

02:34.066 --> 02:35.938
When I was eight,
I joined the Cub Scouts

02:36.025 --> 02:37.983
and I was just
immediately hooked.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.637
It was like...

02:39.724 --> 02:41.639
finally, I found my people.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.163
And...

02:43.250 --> 02:45.426
I proceeded to get
pretty much every

02:45.513 --> 02:46.601
merit badge
known to man.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.994
Uh, my mom
actually had to

02:49.081 --> 02:50.953
[distantly]:
make an extra-wide
sash to hold them...

02:51.040 --> 02:52.172
[grunting]

02:57.264 --> 03:00.354
[Christy panting]

03:03.879 --> 03:06.186
You're amazing.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.448
You sound like my mom.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.492
[laughs]

03:12.583 --> 03:14.150
Uh, okay, um...

03:14.237 --> 03:16.239
well, good night.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.109
Good night.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.247
No. Uh...

03:24.334 --> 03:25.248
I gotta go.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.555
Night.
Night.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.732
Looking forward to our hike.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.561
Our what?

03:49.141 --> 03:50.317
So he pulled over
to show me

03:50.404 --> 03:51.753
this stop sign
he made...

03:51.840 --> 03:53.494
What?
I don't know...

03:53.581 --> 03:55.235
made, painted, installed...
I wasn't listening.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.716
I was too busy
fantasizing

03:58.803 --> 04:00.283
about being in
the back seat with him,

04:00.370 --> 04:02.024
doing it like a couple
of ninth graders.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.418
Ninth grade?

04:04.505 --> 04:06.158
Tenth?

04:07.682 --> 04:10.598
What grade makes me
sound normal?

04:10.685 --> 04:12.426
Never mind.
So what happened?

04:12.513 --> 04:14.254
I stuck to the plan

04:14.341 --> 04:15.429
and played it slow.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.778
Good for you.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.867
Thanks.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.172
Although, I am ashamed of what
I did when I went in the house.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.436
Oh, please,

04:22.523 --> 04:24.002
that's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

04:24.089 --> 04:24.960
You're a
grown woman.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.353
No... no!

04:26.440 --> 04:27.179
Not that.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.181
Oh.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.096
I ate all of my son's
pudding cups.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.097
Oh.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.970
Six of them.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.581
My farts smelled
like butterscotch.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.672
Well, well, well.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.285
Isn't this a surprise?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.417
Hi, Mom.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.767
You know Marjorie
from the meeting.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.117
Oh, I do.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.206
Marjorie.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.296
Bonnie.

04:57.645 --> 04:58.994
Would you like
to join us?

04:59.081 --> 05:00.169
I'd like to join you,

05:00.256 --> 05:01.213
but I'll make the best of it.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.609
Marjorie has been giving me

05:05.696 --> 05:07.785
some really good
relationship advice.

05:07.872 --> 05:09.091
BONNIE:
Is that so?

05:09.178 --> 05:10.222
Why wouldn't
you come to

05:10.310 --> 05:11.920
your own mother
for that?

05:12.007 --> 05:13.487
The same reason

05:13.574 --> 05:14.314
I don't come to you
for advice

05:14.401 --> 05:16.664
about beekeeping.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.144
You know nothing about it.

05:19.231 --> 05:21.277
For the record,
I've had hundreds

05:21.364 --> 05:25.194
of successful
relationships with men.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.631
The fact that you don't know

05:27.718 --> 05:29.154
what you just said
is horrifying.

05:29.241 --> 05:32.157
What did I say?

05:32.244 --> 05:34.290
You know,
these things

05:34.377 --> 05:36.205
aren't always
judged on quantity.

05:36.292 --> 05:39.164
I was with one
wonderful man

05:39.251 --> 05:40.470
for 30 years.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.124
And then
he left you.He died.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.082
Spin it however
you want.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.302
Marjorie's just trying
to help me.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.391
Oh, I get it.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.261
You think she's wise
'cause she's old.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.354
So what's your
big advice?

05:54.441 --> 05:56.268
Well, I told
your daughter,

05:56.356 --> 05:57.400
who came to me
instead of you...

06:00.534 --> 06:01.883
...that if she
really wants

06:01.970 --> 06:03.406
something meaningful
with this guy,

06:03.493 --> 06:05.887
she shouldn't
have sex with him

06:05.974 --> 06:07.671
for at least
three months.

06:07.758 --> 06:08.324
[laughing]

06:11.458 --> 06:14.504
I'm sorry, that's not a joke?

06:14.591 --> 06:16.376
No.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.638
Oh, come on.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.248
What if she
waits three months

06:19.335 --> 06:21.946
and then finds out
he can't deliver the goods?

06:22.033 --> 06:25.210
True intimacy doesn't depend
on "delivering the goods."

06:25.297 --> 06:26.995
Oh, Marjorie.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.953
You make me sad.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.043
Well, what does
this guy say?

06:32.130 --> 06:33.828
Is he okay with
taking it slow?

06:33.915 --> 06:35.177
He thinks it's a great idea.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.744
Flag on the play.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.310
What?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.442
Real men
don't go slow.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.575
He's either
lying, gay

06:41.662 --> 06:42.967
or he's packing
a gherkin.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.056
It's a little
pickle.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.885
I know what it is.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.409
Just do yourself
a favor.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.759
If you're
going to wait,

06:51.846 --> 06:52.673
at least make sure
there's something

06:52.760 --> 06:54.892
worth waiting for.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.112
Oh, what's she
supposed to do?

06:57.199 --> 06:58.635
Ask him
to whip it out?

06:58.722 --> 07:00.028
No.

07:00.115 --> 07:00.289
Show a little
class, Marjorie.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.295
Do a drive-by.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.383
A drive-by?

07:07.470 --> 07:10.168
A drive-by.

07:10.255 --> 07:13.302
You know, cruise by
the general vicinity.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.394
Send your knee on
a fact-finding mission.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.613
Oh, God.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.875
Do you believe her?

07:20.962 --> 07:24.574
It's actually
not bad advice.

07:24.661 --> 07:27.272
My late husband loved me,
but wow...

07:27.359 --> 07:30.058
there was not a lot
to work with.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.409
Twerkin' the gherkin.

07:36.020 --> 07:36.760
Okay.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.806
I gotta go.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.372
Thanks, Marjorie.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.722
I don't know how

07:41.809 --> 07:43.071
I would get through
this without you.

07:43.158 --> 07:43.854
Oh, you're welcome, dear.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.769
And, Mom...

07:46.727 --> 07:48.990
...nice jacket.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.309
So how long you been a widow?

08:04.396 --> 08:06.311
Little over eight years.

08:06.398 --> 08:09.489
That's tough.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.232
Want to come with me
to a cop bar?

08:20.587 --> 08:21.501
Since when do you bake pies?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.633
Since the pastry chef

08:23.720 --> 08:24.939
threw a hissy fit and quit.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.375
What happened?

08:26.462 --> 08:27.594
I got tired of
having sex with her.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.858
What do you mean,
"what happened?"

08:30.945 --> 08:32.424
Chef Rudy, we need
to hire a new pastry
chef right away.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.210
And this time,
let's get a man.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.342
Like that'll stop me.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.432
You zig, I zag.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.783
But you don't know anything
about desserts.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.174
Well, up until recently,

08:44.261 --> 08:45.089
I didn't know anything
about bisexuality,

08:45.176 --> 08:46.569
but I'm a quick study.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.615
Right, Paul?

08:55.056 --> 08:56.361
I, uh...

08:56.448 --> 08:56.927
I texted you three times
last night.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.450
I know.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.495
Why didn't you
text me back?

08:59.582 --> 09:01.628
I was on a date.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.760
So? I was having dinner
with my in-laws--

09:03.847 --> 09:06.589
I still found the time.Gabriel,

09:06.676 --> 09:08.199
you have a lovely wife.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.288
Why can't you find
happiness at home?

09:10.375 --> 09:13.074
It doesn't work that way
when you marry for money.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.511
I don't know what to tell you.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.557
I hear Chef Rudy
is experimenting.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.429
Maybe you could find
happiness with him.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.266
â™ª â™ª

09:31.353 --> 09:34.138
Who ate all my pudding?

09:34.225 --> 09:35.966
Wasn't me.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.489
Okay, I'm out of here.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.057
Mom, did you eat my pudding?

09:40.144 --> 09:41.929
Um, no.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.888
Maybe youate it.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.412
Did I?

09:47.499 --> 09:50.459
I think
I'm losing my mind.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.725
What's the story here?
Are you a lesbian now?

09:55.812 --> 09:58.685
I'm going hiking with Adam.

09:58.772 --> 10:01.296
Since when do you hike?I don't.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.907
I'm faking it to please a man.
It's what we do.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.431
Hey, wait,

10:06.518 --> 10:07.781
can I ask you something?

10:07.868 --> 10:10.435
Yes. These areyour jeans.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.656
No. I just need
some advice about Luke.

10:13.743 --> 10:16.354
Oh. Really?

10:16.441 --> 10:20.750
You want to talk
to your old mom?

10:20.837 --> 10:22.709
That's great.
So, what's going on?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.798
Ever since he found out
I'm pregnant,

10:24.885 --> 10:27.365
he's afraid
to have sex with me.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.893
Huh.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.809
What else is going on?

10:35.896 --> 10:37.245
Nothing. That's it.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.987
He's scared
he's gonna hurt the baby.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.554
Right.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.121
Sure.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.557
So...

10:45.645 --> 10:48.125
So, uh...

10:48.212 --> 10:52.347
I guess you could
explain to Luke that...

10:52.434 --> 10:54.436
there are certain...

10:59.093 --> 11:01.051
...sexual...

11:01.138 --> 11:03.401
positions, um...

11:03.488 --> 11:06.709
which would
allow him to...

11:06.796 --> 11:07.579
I can't do this!

11:07.667 --> 11:09.799
Google it!

11:13.020 --> 11:15.283
I'm so glad
we can talk like this.

11:20.767 --> 11:24.858
Hey, um, we're still
going slow, right?

11:24.945 --> 11:26.294
Yeah.
Okay.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.035
But even if we weren't,

11:28.122 --> 11:29.471
I'm not doing it
in the freakin' woods.

11:29.558 --> 11:33.301
Right.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.304
[thunder crashes]

11:36.391 --> 11:38.567
Oh, that's not good.

11:38.654 --> 11:39.655
We have time to get
back, don't we?

11:39.742 --> 11:43.572
Um...

11:43.659 --> 11:45.095
No.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.713
Hello?

11:53.800 --> 11:54.975
Hey, I don't think
anybody's home.

11:55.062 --> 11:55.932
Wait here.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.020
Where are you going?

11:57.107 --> 11:58.500
Just wait!

12:00.110 --> 12:01.721
[glass breaks]

12:03.853 --> 12:05.637
Come on in!

12:05.725 --> 12:09.554
I'm not really comfortable
with breaking and entering.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.948
For you, it's just entering.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.560
It's a good point.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.999
You're luring me
into a life of crime here.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.044
Oh, don't worry.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.872
If the owners come back,
we'll just kill 'em.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.268
You know how
to make a fire?

12:27.355 --> 12:31.489
Do I know how to make a fire?

12:34.536 --> 12:35.580
You gotta admit, though,

12:35.667 --> 12:38.453
cabin in the woods, rainy night.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.541
It's kind of romantic.

12:39.628 --> 12:43.414
Yes, yes, it is.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.633
Excuse me.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.468
Hi, Marjorie?

12:53.555 --> 12:54.295
It's Christy.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.687
So, listen,

12:55.775 --> 12:59.300
I think God wants me
to get laid.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.745
It's too bad we don't have
any marshmallows.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.965
Oh, but we do.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.576
Really?

13:14.663 --> 13:15.533
That's right.
A good Scout never leaves home

13:15.620 --> 13:17.840
without a s'mores kit.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.712
Do you want...?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.671
Uh, no, maybe later.

13:24.281 --> 13:28.329
Uh! It is really
comfy here.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.810
Yeah, yeah.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.554
Are you mad at me?

13:36.641 --> 13:39.427
Why would I be mad at you?

13:39.514 --> 13:42.996
I don't know.
'Cause we're not
taking advantage

13:43.083 --> 13:43.648
of the comfy-ness.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.522
Is that an option?

13:47.609 --> 13:49.698
No, it's not.
I checked.

13:51.743 --> 13:52.919
Are youokay?

13:53.006 --> 13:56.400
Yeah, yeah,
it's just not how

13:56.487 --> 13:57.662
I usually do things.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.143
What does that mean?

14:00.230 --> 14:03.755
Well, in the past,
I would jump into bed

14:03.843 --> 14:07.063
with a guy right away
'cause I was afraid

14:07.150 --> 14:10.675
if I didn't,
he'd... leave.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.591
Why the heck
would anyone leave you?

14:13.678 --> 14:15.985
You're-you're wonderful.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.253
I didn't think so.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.821
It's weird. I've never left
anyone I've slept with.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.175
What's this now?

14:32.262 --> 14:33.916
I always thought
it was such a miracle

14:34.003 --> 14:36.136
that a woman
would have sex with me,

14:36.223 --> 14:38.660
the least I could do was give
her the rest of my life.

14:38.747 --> 14:42.142
You didn't actually
say that to them?

14:42.229 --> 14:45.841
[scoffs] That's a mistake
you only make once.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.016
Unless you're me,

14:47.103 --> 14:48.757
and then you do it
every time.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.762
Yeah, you know, maybe
it's good that we're waiting.

14:53.849 --> 14:57.679
Yeah, maybe.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.861
This is nice.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.776
Sure is.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.999
Thank you for...

15:15.566 --> 15:17.829
being so understanding.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.616
You're welcome.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.226
I'm a lucky girl.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.837
Yep, very lucky.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.931
If you're curious,
I can just show it to you.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.851
I'm just saying,
I walked in on my parents

15:39.939 --> 15:42.680
having sex once
and it freaked me out.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.508
This is not the same
thing at all.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.162
No, it's worse.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.164
Our kid can't run out
of the room screaming.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.820
Hey!

15:51.907 --> 15:54.910
Mom, tell Luke
that he can't hurt the baby.

15:54.997 --> 15:59.088
Well, if I do that,
he'll have sex with you.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.568
Stick to your guns, buddy.

16:00.655 --> 16:01.873
[clicks tongue]

16:05.877 --> 16:07.836
I feel like
such an idiot!
Oh, honey,

16:07.923 --> 16:10.317
it's gonna be okay.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.797
No, it's not.
He's never gonna call.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.538
Oh, it's only been a week.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.106
Oh, wake up. If a man hasn't
called after three days,

16:17.193 --> 16:18.542
he might as well be dead.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.154
This is all your fault.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.590
What did I do?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.809
You told her
not to sleep with him,

16:24.896 --> 16:26.289
and he took a hike.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.943
Oh, hiking.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.945
You see that?

16:30.032 --> 16:33.601
She took your advice, not mine,
and now she's devastated. I win.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.820
Honey, it's good thing
you didn't sleep with him.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.518
He's a jerk.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.259
More bad advice.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.565
If she'd slept with him,
she'd own the jerk by now.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.176
And is that
what you'd want?

16:43.263 --> 16:44.568
What's her other option?

16:44.655 --> 16:46.266
I don't know, maybe
meet a nice guy.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.529
Oh, so when she cheats on him,
she's the jerk?

16:48.616 --> 16:50.574
Think it through, Marjorie.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.273
I'm gonna ignore you
because you're insane.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.362
Christy,

16:55.449 --> 16:56.841
if a man won't wait
until you're ready

16:56.928 --> 16:59.322
to share your secret garden,

16:59.409 --> 17:02.412
he's not worth
a second of your time.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.023
Secret garden?

17:06.895 --> 17:10.768
Holy Moses, how many cats
do you own?

17:11.769 --> 17:13.597
Four.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.557
[mouthing]

17:16.644 --> 17:18.646
[mocking]:
"Oh sure, Christy,

17:18.733 --> 17:22.998
I'm fine going slow 'cause I'm
never gonna call you anyway."

17:23.085 --> 17:26.393
Screw you, Scoutmaster!

17:26.480 --> 17:28.525
I never want to see
your stupid face again!

17:31.311 --> 17:33.922
I never want to see
your stupid face again!
What?

17:34.009 --> 17:35.750
If I'd known you
were such a jerk,

17:35.837 --> 17:37.839
I would've had sex with you
all over that cabin!

17:37.926 --> 17:40.276
Once again, what?

17:40.363 --> 17:41.886
Instead, I opened myself up
to you,

17:41.973 --> 17:43.801
I was totally vulnerable,
and I told you things

17:43.888 --> 17:45.194
that I never told anybody else!

17:45.281 --> 17:46.891
And what do you do?
You blow me off!

17:46.978 --> 17:48.284
Wait, hold on.
I didn't blow you off.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.590
You blew meoff.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.374
No, no, no, no!
You were the one

17:51.461 --> 17:53.333
who did the blowing-- the
blowing was done by you!

17:53.420 --> 17:55.552
Christy, did you ever get
the flowers?

17:55.639 --> 17:57.598
What flowers?

17:57.685 --> 17:59.774
The ones I dropped off
at the restaurant

17:59.861 --> 18:00.905
the day after we went hiking.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.778
You sent me flowers?

18:03.865 --> 18:07.956
Roses. With a note saying,
"I hike you."

18:11.525 --> 18:12.874
Aw.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.136
And when I didn't hear back
from you,

18:14.223 --> 18:15.442
I figured
you just weren't into me.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.139
I never got them.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.619
That's weird. I dropped 'em off

18:18.706 --> 18:20.142
with a pasty-faced guy
in a nice suit.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.012
He promised me
he'd give 'em to you.

18:27.323 --> 18:27.976
I hike you, too.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.806
Where are you going?

18:31.893 --> 18:33.677
I'd tell you, but I know

18:33.764 --> 18:34.287
that you're squeamish
about homicide.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.202
Call me!

18:40.380 --> 18:42.860
Where are my
freaking flowers?

18:42.947 --> 18:45.689
What are you talking about?

18:45.776 --> 18:46.908
Don't screw with me!

18:46.995 --> 18:48.475
Adam said he
dropped 'em off

18:48.562 --> 18:50.129
with a pasty-faced guy
in a nice suit.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.043
Nice suit, pasty face!

18:54.089 --> 18:57.658
I prefer fair-skinned, but okay.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.268
Where are they?!

18:59.355 --> 19:00.313
Look, I know I should've
given them to you,

19:00.400 --> 19:03.359
but I just got so jealous.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.492
Tell me!Oh, boy.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.494
This is awkward.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.365
You remember how you advised me

19:09.452 --> 19:13.064
that I should work
on my relationship with my wife?

19:13.152 --> 19:16.111
You gave my flowers
to your wife?

19:16.198 --> 19:18.069
If it makes you feel any better,

19:18.157 --> 19:19.070
she still wouldn't sleep
with me.

19:21.725 --> 19:22.639
[clears throat]

19:22.726 --> 19:24.032
What's this?

19:24.119 --> 19:24.946
What do you think it is?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.165
Oh.

19:38.046 --> 19:41.005
I owe you an apology.
This is delicious.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.018
So, when are you seeing
the Boy Scout again?

19:54.105 --> 19:56.804
Next Saturday.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.022
We're going fly-fishing.

19:58.109 --> 20:02.462
Whatever the hell that is.

20:02.549 --> 20:06.205
Your secret garden
still on lockdown?

20:06.292 --> 20:10.252
If you mean am I choosing
to delay gratification

20:10.339 --> 20:11.035
to ensure an emotionally
fulfilling relationship,

20:11.122 --> 20:13.081
then yes.

20:13.168 --> 20:16.040
And I don't want
to talk about it.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.260
Fine. What about you?

20:18.347 --> 20:22.656
Your boyfriend still afraid he's
gonna poke the baby's eye out?

20:24.614 --> 20:26.355
He happens to be

20:26.442 --> 20:29.358
a very sensitive
and considerate guy. And...

20:29.445 --> 20:31.360
I don't want to talk
about it either.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.410
All right. If no one's gonna ask
about me,

20:37.497 --> 20:39.238
I'll just tell you.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.327
I went home with a vice cop
last night

20:41.414 --> 20:43.329
and, yes, I do want
to talk about it.
