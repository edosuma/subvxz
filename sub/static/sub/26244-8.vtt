about potential downsides
to the enchantment?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.320
To be honest,
I just copied the page I needed.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.614
I didn't read the rest of it too closely.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.202
Did you follow up on footnote number 35?

13:48.786 --> 13:51.622
-Uh, no. I was kind of in a rush.
-[Alfur scoffs]

13:51.705 --> 13:54.458
Never, ever ignore a footnote.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.502
We need to check it immediately.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.973
I didn't know this room even existed.

14:09.056 --> 14:13.102
Libraries are thrilling temples
of the unexpected!

14:13.185 --> 14:16.605
Here it is. <i>"How to Aid</i>
<i>and Keep Thy Friends Forever."</i>

14:16.689 --> 14:19.525
Okay, let's find out what it says
in the footnote.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.111
-There!
-[Frida and Alfur gasp]

14:22.194 --> 14:24.196
[Frida] It's a whole page of info!

14:24.280 --> 14:26.866
It's probably just a lot
of blah, blah, blah, right?

14:26.949 --> 14:29.618
I mean, who would put
anything important in the footnote?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.037
[scoffs] Whoever wrote this book,
that's who!

14:32.621 --> 14:37.209
Uh, side effects include blanked-out eyes,
occasional growling,

14:37.293 --> 14:39.920
or a fine mist rising
from the enchantee's scalp,

14:40.004 --> 14:43.424
typical signs that the soul is preparing
to be forfeited to the enchanter

14:43.507 --> 14:44.884
for all eternity.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.635
You're stealing their souls!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.846
Oh, no! That's horrible!

14:48.929 --> 14:51.765
Oh, I guess that's one way
to keep your friends forever.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.311
This is not at all what I meant to do.
Please tell me there's a way to stop it.

14:55.394 --> 14:59.148
Hold on. It looks like there's
some kind of 30-day trial period.

14:59.940 --> 15:03.652
"If the enchanted tide mouse is returned
by the end of the 30 days,

15:03.736 --> 15:05.362
the enchantment is broken.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.740
Please be advised
that the official disenchantment

15:07.823 --> 15:10.951
requires certain actions
on the part of all involved."

15:11.035 --> 15:12.745
Such as what?

15:12.828 --> 15:15.831
-It doesn't say.
-Is there another footnote?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.333
No, but...

15:17.416 --> 15:19.710
Aha! There is an asterisk.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.588
[Frida] Yes!
"See appendix one for instructions."

15:23.881 --> 15:26.717
That is the tiniest fine print
I've ever seen.

15:28.886 --> 15:32.765
[Alfur gasps] It's a masterpiece
of confusing clauses, that's for sure.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.099
What does it say we have to do?

15:34.183 --> 15:36.936
"Step one: the witch must first perform--"

15:37.019 --> 15:39.146
Wait! We need a witch to make this work?

15:39.229 --> 15:41.148
W-- We don't know any witches.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.735
Hilda, you cast the spell.
That makes you the witch.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.654
What? No.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.322
I'm afraid yes.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.868
"The witch must first perform
this chant out loud with vigor,

15:52.952 --> 15:56.080
but it only works
if you do it at moonrise.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.457
Once the disenchantment has begun,

15:58.540 --> 16:02.461
it must be completed within an hour
in order to take effect."

16:02.544 --> 16:05.965
Oh! There's a footnote
to the asterisk of the footnote!

16:06.715 --> 16:09.718
"Do not forget to feed
the disenchanted tide mouse

16:09.802 --> 16:14.890
a small morsel of bread at the end,
or it will never leave you in peace."

16:15.391 --> 16:18.602
-Good to know.
-The 30 days are almost over.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.813
We've already missed moonrise for tonight.

16:20.896 --> 16:23.107
Then tomorrow night's our last chance.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.318
-During The Warblers' concert?
-I'll keep an eye on the clock.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.528
When it's time for moonrise,

16:27.611 --> 16:30.239
I'll signal you by striking
my triangle three times,

16:30.322 --> 16:32.324
then you can break out the chant.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.618
But I'll be on stage
in front of an audience

16:34.702 --> 16:36.578
for the first time in my life.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.874
-I'm going to seem a little crazy.
-You're going to seem a lot crazy.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.921
[chatter]

16:52.970 --> 16:54.096
Welcome back!

16:54.930 --> 16:58.976
What a great evening
of fund raising and frivolity.

And now, for our grand finale,
"Sparrow Scouts Forever."
