Hey, Brenda! Kenny's coming
for a visit with his new baby.

00:39.179 --> 00:40.880
We're gonna have to change
the sheets in the guest room,

00:40.914 --> 00:43.582
and make sure there is
no medication lying around.

00:43.617 --> 00:44.584
Got it, got it.

00:44.618 --> 00:46.152
Gonna be fun.
WOMAN: Hello?

00:46.187 --> 00:48.254
Good time with that baby.
Good to see my baby...

00:48.288 --> 00:51.391
This is a league game. You can't just
leave early, or you'll be disqualified.

00:51.425 --> 00:55.396
So you'd rather win this in a weasel
way than settle this on the boards?

00:55.430 --> 00:58.333
Speaking of the boards, let me just...

00:58.367 --> 01:00.202
Yep, I'm still ahead.

01:00.236 --> 01:01.269
(CHUCKLES)

01:01.304 --> 01:02.738
So why don't you decide, Tammy.

01:02.772 --> 01:05.507
You want me to win by points
or disqualification?

01:05.541 --> 01:10.611
Well, whatever. I've got more important shit
in my life than arguing with your dumb ass.

01:10.646 --> 01:15.215
My famous baseball-player son is
coming for a visit with his new baby.

01:15.249 --> 01:20.286
And would this be the son that got busted doing
steroids and had that prostitution scandal?

01:20.320 --> 01:23.456
You must be very proud.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.492
Oh!

01:26.527 --> 01:29.296
I guess you win by disqualification.
You're the champ.

Well goddamn. Somebody's doing
pretty good for themselves, I see.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.642
All right. Let's go
over some ground rules.

02:17.045 --> 02:19.113
First off, go along
with everything I say.

02:19.147 --> 02:22.984
You can't just walk right in there and ask
her to raise your baby right off the bat.

pretty sweet.

the Xanie, it's almost like heroin.

06:28.258 --> 06:30.059
Is it really?
Mm-hmm. That's what I heard.

06:30.093 --> 06:31.994
Why in the hell didn't
you tell me that before?

06:32.028 --> 06:34.296
Yeah, I'm just rockin' this Adderall here.
Keeps me focused.

06:34.331 --> 06:37.233

mouth and occasional constipation.

I like those. I'd ke
to have some of those.

verge of a comeback. There you go.

Mmm. Not bad. What
is it you want?

a few of the muscle relaxers,

06:50.613 --> 06:51.680

those other ones.

Okay, I don't want to see
any of this shit, yeah.

Don't you breathe on me like that.

07:28.654 --> 07:31.722
Oh, speaking of missing, I am
missing my daily lane time.

07:31.756 --> 07:33.523
Oh, I got a hell of an idea.

light my fire back then.

that category, Casper.

pubic play.

09:16.930 --> 09:19.031
Pubic play? What
exactly is that?

09:19.066 --> 09:23.135
That's when you put your pubic hairs
together, and you go like this.

09:23.170 --> 09:26.038
You just mash your
pubic hairs together?

09:26.073 --> 09:28.007

rug fire doing that.

Well, maybe I should just
fucking kill myself!

09:44.193 --> 09:47.428
Well maybe you should go grow some
fucking eyebrows! Get outta here, man.

to the 3, and to the other part.

is it a buffalo?

10:24.368 --> 10:25.869

10:25.903 --> 10:27.370
No. How the fuck is that video games?
Just look what I'm drawing.

10:27.404 --> 10:30.040
Uh, uh, is it a goat in a gate?

10:30.074 --> 10:31.107

It is not fucking video
games! Jesus Christ!

10:34.945 --> 10:36.212
EDUARDO: Is that a
three-legged dog?

10:36.246 --> 10:37.446
KENNY: No it's not a
three-legged dog.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.847
Sweetheart, you have to
show him the pictures.

10:38.882 --> 10:40.716
EDUARDO: All right, all right,
it's an angel in a car...

10:40.750 --> 10:41.850
KENNY: No.

10:41.884 --> 10:43.018
EDUARDO: It's an angel...

10:43.052 --> 10:44.686
It's a girl with her head smashed in!

He's not on our team.

10:46.422 --> 10:48.623
Time's up!
Time's up! Girls win!

10:48.658 --> 10:50.292
Girls win. Yay!

10:50.326 --> 10:52.828
It's a fucking poncho.
Oh!

10:52.863 --> 10:54.430
I can see that.

10:54.464 --> 10:56.199
EDUARDO: Are you
kidding me?

10:56.233 --> 10:58.001
Good thing you can throw a baseball,
'cause you can't draw for shit.

10:58.035 --> 11:00.003
You draw like a retard.

11:00.037 --> 11:01.504
(ALL LAUGHING)

11:01.539 --> 11:03.306
I'm not bad at
drawing. Stop it.

11:03.341 --> 11:08.010
Well, okay now, that's, that's all about all
I can take for excitement in one night.

11:08.045 --> 11:09.913
That's plenty for me.
I'm gonna go to bed.

11:09.947 --> 11:13.316
Hold on, hold on a minute,
Tammy. Hold on, hold on.

11:14.651 --> 11:16.552
I, uh...

11:16.586 --> 11:18.120
I got, I have something I wanna say,

11:18.155 --> 11:20.855
and I want everybody
here to bear witness.

11:20.890 --> 11:22.691
I, uh...

11:22.725 --> 11:23.892
It's hard.

11:24.993 --> 11:27.261
I've been gone a long time.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.998
And I didn't know exactly

11:31.500 --> 11:33.935
what it would be like
when I came back,

11:37.106 --> 11:39.841
and you all have made
me feel so at home,

11:39.875 --> 11:43.311
in spite of the fact that we've
been apart all these years.

11:45.047 --> 11:48.216
And I...I want to
assure you,

11:48.250 --> 11:50.251
all of you,

11:50.285 --> 11:53.821
that I'm gonna do everything I can,

11:55.257 --> 11:56.390
to make things right.

11:59.527 --> 12:05.699
And I'm, I'm sorry it took me
so long to come to my senses.

12:08.036 --> 12:11.839
I sincerely hope that
you'll accept my apology.

12:11.873 --> 12:15.976
Okay. That's the end of the speech.
I'm gonna go to bed, too,

12:16.011 --> 12:21.081
and I'm gonna go out and sleep out there in the RV.
I don't wanna impose.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.984
And I want this
relationship to go slow.

12:24.019 --> 12:28.188
No need to sleep outside.
You can sleep in there, on the couch.

12:29.557 --> 12:32.092
Really? I don't mind
sleeping outside.

12:32.126 --> 12:36.296
No, outside is for the dogs.
Inside is for family.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.101
Okay.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.637
And the garage is for cars.

I'm just chillin'. Just
looking at some old stuff.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.202
Kenny, shame on you. What did I say
about you smokin' weed around me?

13:12.237 --> 13:13.403
That I have to share.

13:13.437 --> 13:15.071
(LAUGHING) Yes, that's right.

13:15.105 --> 13:16.405
Well thank you, Son.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.473
You're welcome.

13:17.507 --> 13:18.707
I don't suppose...

(STRAINED) any boy wants
to party with his mama.

13:27.483 --> 13:28.650
What's eatin' at you, Son?

13:28.684 --> 13:30.318
It's just tough in Myrtle.

13:30.353 --> 13:34.523
I'm stressed out about April,
Toby, fuckin' Russian people...

13:34.557 --> 13:37.059
Oh, Doschenka-something?
I read all about him.

13:37.093 --> 13:40.929
Flavor of the month.
We'll see where he is in fifteen years.

13:40.963 --> 13:42.664
See, this is why you're
an awesome parent.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.166
It's because, like, you're really good
at like, building me up, and like,

13:45.200 --> 13:46.901
makin' me feel good about myself.

13:46.936 --> 13:49.771
Unlike April, the fuckin' runaway mom.

13:49.806 --> 13:53.442
Oh, now, it's a hard thing
to forgive, isn't it?

13:53.476 --> 13:56.279
I've still got a lot of
anger toward Eddie, too.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.081
But I'm trying to be better about it.

13:59.684 --> 14:03.187
No good lugging a lot of hate around.
It will give you ass cancer.

14:03.221 --> 14:06.224
Yeah, ain't trying to fuck around
with cancer in my asshole or nothin'.

14:06.258 --> 14:09.393
I'm more or less just kind
of worried about Toby. I mean,

14:09.427 --> 14:12.963
it does seem pretty important to have
a female lady person in their life.

14:12.998 --> 14:15.032
No, that doesn't matter.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.868
You're better off than a lot of folks.
You've got a nanny and everything.

14:17.902 --> 14:19.570
(TOKES)

14:19.604 --> 14:21.005
Yeah, well, that's...

14:21.039 --> 14:24.542
Little baby Toby, he's got a great life.
Don't you cut me off now.

14:24.576 --> 14:26.544
No, no...

14:26.578 --> 14:28.545
To see you end up such a good dad,
I don't know where you learned it.

14:28.580 --> 14:30.014
Definitely not from Eddie.

14:30.048 --> 14:31.549
You make me so happy.

14:33.385 --> 14:34.819
Yeah, well...

14:34.853 --> 14:38.522
Okay, now, your turn. What'd
you want to talk to me about?

14:40.225 --> 14:43.194
Nothing. Let's hit the sack,

What, are you guys bailing?
You're moving out?

15:46.895 --> 15:48.529
I thought you were trying
to get back with Mom?

15:48.563 --> 15:52.367
Oh, I got her back. I got her
back, front, and side-to-side.

15:52.401 --> 15:55.570
Bullshit. There is no way she
fuckin' let you sleep with her.

15:55.605 --> 15:58.440
Yep. It almost didn't
happen, though.

with her pussy a little bit.

TAMMY: Oh, that
is not true.

16:27.273 --> 16:29.641
No, he said that he jerked
himself off, and then...

16:29.675 --> 16:31.877
Wait, are you lying?

the truth? Fine!

16:37.917 --> 16:39.951
I came here to rob your mother.

16:39.986 --> 16:44.789
Does it make you feel good to know that I
lied to you about fucking your mother?

16:44.823 --> 16:48.526
When, actually, I only got one of the
best blowjobs of my entire life.

Oh, fuck this. I'm
going back to bed.

16:51.096 --> 16:53.898

I came here to be with you.

Oh, you did not.

here to ditch the kid!

TAMMY: There he is.

17:21.627 --> 17:25.431
I can't believe it, it's...
I mean, for him to say something like you came here

17:25.464 --> 17:27.532
to get rid of your baby.

17:27.567 --> 17:30.269
That is so unforgivable.

It's not true. It couldn't
possibly be true.

17:34.441 --> 17:36.175

Well, I didn't come here
to get rid of him.

as more of a loan program.

to be the man there, and also have a son.

that he's awesome, but,

why April left in the first place!

are tough with baseball.

We all have hard times,
even champions.

18:15.413 --> 18:20.516

someday baseball will end.

18:20.551 --> 18:23.285
And April may never come back.

(CROWD CHATTERING)

23:45.849 --> 23:50.253
Tammy, for all the heartbreak
I have caused you,

23:50.320 --> 23:52.221
and I've caused some,

23:52.255 --> 23:54.557
I, I'm sorry...

23:54.591 --> 23:57.894
and I, I want you
back. Forever.

23:57.928 --> 24:00.529
And I also want to tell
you that I am sorry.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.264
And I'd like back my son.

24:02.299 --> 24:04.133
Forever.

24:04.168 --> 24:06.369
Or at least until April
returns to claim him.

24:10.141 --> 24:11.841
BOTH: We love you.

24:14.612 --> 24:18.181
It's true you both have
hurt me deeply.

24:18.216 --> 24:22.753
But I'm no saint. And I have done my
fair share of fucked-up shit, too.

24:22.788 --> 24:25.757
So it wouldn't be fair
to judge two men

24:25.791 --> 24:30.561
who have either entered, Eddie,
or exited, Kenny, my vagina.

24:30.596 --> 24:33.898
But your speeches have shown
me that you really do care.

24:33.932 --> 24:36.300
And I accept your apologies.

24:36.335 --> 24:38.168
Yeah!
CROWD: Aw.

24:38.203 --> 24:41.005
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

24:42.041 --> 24:43.074
My son!

24:43.108 --> 24:44.709
Come on, baby!

24:44.743 --> 24:46.644
Guess who's back, motherfucker?
I said I forgive you.

24:46.678 --> 24:48.946
TAMMY: I never said...

24:48.981 --> 24:52.883
I've been patient enough.
And now, watch me bury this bozo.

24:52.918 --> 24:54.084
(CHEERING)

25:06.431 --> 25:07.597
Yes!

25:07.632 --> 25:09.065
(CHEERING)

25:11.168 --> 25:12.869
WOMAN: That's it, Tam!

25:15.606 --> 25:16.739
(INAUDIBLE)

25:43.003 --> 25:46.505
(CHEERING)

25:49.042 --> 25:50.575
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

25:50.610 --> 25:51.810
(LAUGHING)

25:54.280 --> 25:55.480
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

26:09.897 --> 26:11.464
(CHEERING)

26:13.134 --> 26:15.102
Go on, go on.

26:16.204 --> 26:17.371
The speech was good.

26:17.406 --> 26:19.340
Yeah, yours wasn't too bad, either.

26:19.374 --> 26:22.042
You get that from me, you know.

26:22.077 --> 26:24.745
Your throwing arm,
that's from your mama.

26:24.779 --> 26:26.547
But your oratin' skills,

26:26.581 --> 26:28.182
that's all me.

26:28.216 --> 26:31.084
Yeah, well I can definitely see
similarities in our styles.

26:31.118 --> 26:32.818
Your bald head actually
doesn't look that bad.

26:32.853 --> 26:37.022
Oh, thank you. I like the hair that's
on your shoulders and your neck.

26:37.056 --> 26:38.256
(CHUCKLES)

26:39.292 --> 26:40.859
TAMMY: Hey!

26:40.894 --> 26:43.996
Hold on, hold on. You're not
taking my grandbaby on that thing.

26:44.031 --> 26:46.065
Well, how the hell do you expect
us to get back to Myrtle?

26:46.100 --> 26:48.735
Oh, no, no. Not my grandbaby.
You take the minivan.

26:48.770 --> 26:50.671
Oh, fuck no. I'm not
driving the minivan.

26:50.705 --> 26:51.772
TAMMY: Oh, hell you are.

26:51.806 --> 26:52.973
Listen to your mom, Son.

26:53.008 --> 26:54.408
TAMMY: Don't you
tell me you're not.

26:54.443 --> 26:56.344
(FADES OUT) You cannot take a baby...

26:56.378 --> 27:01.316
KENNY: <i>Chapter six. Fucking making
straight-up decisions now, dude.</i>

27:01.350 --> 27:04.152
<i>As my epic comeback nears its zenith,</i>

27:04.186 --> 27:07.288
<i>I can't help but look back at the low
times when there was no hope or light.</i>

27:09.190 --> 27:10.924
<i>There's an old expression</i>
<i>that has guided me</i>

27:10.958 --> 27:13.593
<i>through the dark valleys and</i>
<i>hazy cul-de-sacs of life.</i>

27:13.627 --> 27:17.263
<i>"Nut up, or sack up."</i>

27:17.297 --> 27:21.167
<i>It means when life gets you all swirly
and thought-ridden, shut it out,</i>

27:21.201 --> 27:24.304
<i>and let the two spherical sperm factories
underneath your dick take over.</i>

27:26.974 --> 27:30.878
<i>They don't think, they don't get confused.
They churn, and attack.</i>

27:32.680 --> 27:35.950
<i>And in moments of doubt, my default
setting is always to attack.</i>

27:35.984 --> 27:39.788
<i>Whether it be a hitter, or an ump, or a
loved one who has stepped out of line.</i>

27:44.459 --> 27:47.127
<i>Not everyone can achieve</i>
<i>their dreams in this world.</i>

27:47.162 --> 27:50.964
<i>That's because most people have things like
feelings, and sentimental attachments.</i>

27:50.999 --> 27:54.567
<i>Nagging shit that keeps them from making
the tough decisions that are necessary</i>

27:54.602 --> 27:56.236
<i>to get to the ultimate top.</i>

27:59.473 --> 28:03.442
<i>Unfortunately, the rocket ship</i>
<i>of fame has only room for one.</i>

28:03.477 --> 28:05.578
<i>Any added baggage will</i>
<i>just weigh you down.</i>

28:05.646 --> 28:08.781
<i>Hold you back from shooting</i>
<i>for the fuckin' stars.</i>

28:08.815 --> 28:11.150
<i>Blast off, bitch.</i>
