I'll catch you on
the flip side. [grunts]

01:26.834 --> 01:29.417
Oh, I get it. It's sarcasm!

Actually, it's a pun.

And that's why Tobias Trollhammer
is my idol.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.083
It's a cool trailer,
but he's just an action guy.

02:18.125 --> 02:19.709
Well, it's more than that.

02:19.792 --> 02:22.166
His movies taught me that when
something's in your way,

02:22.250 --> 02:24.709
it's not a problem,
it's a challenge!

02:24.792 --> 02:26.375
Like that hat?

02:26.458 --> 02:28.417
Oh, right. This is
the same kind of hat

02:28.500 --> 02:32.083
that Tobias wore in
Krillhunter II: Time to Krill.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.500
I thought it might
make him notice me.

02:33.583 --> 02:35.917
After all, I'm not the only
one who wants his autograph.

We don't want that

Sorry, Milo,

Nobody wants to
see him anymore.

up over there?

We're friends? That's so nice.

I'm being sarcastic?

03:19.458 --> 03:20.875
Well, I can now.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.750
Wait a minute. You're not
even a real security guard.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.041
Do you even work here?

03:24.125 --> 03:26.291
Yeah, the letters on your back

And your walkie-talkie is just a bar of
soap with a straw shoved it.

I filed a permit with the city and
extended my crosswalk all the way to here.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.875
So today, I am protecting
Tobias Trollhammer.

- Right.

You've got to take me to the infirmary.

old sick prisoner routine?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.917
No, no, you're right.
Too dramatic?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.458
- Way over the top.
- It still worked, though.

Wait, if that's Zack...

Okay, guys, time for plan H.

in your backpack?

04:22.333 --> 04:23.625
Oh, it telescopes down.

04:23.709 --> 04:25.792
Which is ironic, 'cause,
you know, it's a periscope.

Can you see Elliot?

04:27.542 --> 04:29.625

is a cup of Murphy's Law.

And there's hardly
any krill in it at all!

have abandoned me.

Your fans haven't
abandoned you!

line of them out there!

As soon as they get their ice cream
they're going to come over here, Tobias!

It's almost like my career
has been jinxed by a menninkainen.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.041
What the heck is a menninkainen?

05:34.125 --> 05:36.375
It's a goblin from
Scandinavian folklore.

He comes on his sled of doom to curse you
with bad luck and eat your soul.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.166
How does he eat your soul?

05:42.250 --> 05:43.750
I do not know the particulars.

05:43.834 --> 05:47.709
Tobias, I promise you,
there's no goblins haunting you.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.875

but you do not know.

Okay, places everyone.
Let's try to get this in one take.

in the hospital.

on the horizon.

so he's awfully small.

a magnifying glass?

06:41.250 --> 06:43.458
- The biggest.
- You're just what he needs.

06:43.542 --> 06:46.166
He needs to see you.
To know that he is loved.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.166
To know that
people still care.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.625
Now go find him.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.250
You want us to chase the man
who ran away from us in terror?

06:52.333 --> 06:53.917
The most noble thing you can do

06:54.000 --> 06:57.125
is support the ego of a man
who pretends to hunt krill!

06:57.208 --> 06:58.291
He's right!

Now go! Go!
Go like the wind!

I'm okay with it!

Oh, no! It's the menninkainen,
on his sled of doom!

And the director,
on his sled of doom!

07:27.125 --> 07:29.375
And I have no idea
who those guys are.

go see that movie.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.625
That was amazing!

10:30.709 --> 10:33.834
I can easily build an entire
movie around that chase scene.

10:33.917 --> 10:35.667
Tobias, baby, you're back!

10:35.750 --> 10:37.792
Please tell me there was
film in the camera.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.875
- Oh, there wasn't any film in the camera.
- What?

10:39.959 --> 10:41.667
Because we don't
use film anymore.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.083
This is a video camera.

10:43.166 --> 10:45.166
So tell me there was
videotape in the camera.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.125
There wasn't any video tape
in the camera either.

10:47.208 --> 10:50.667
- What?
- Because we don't use video tape anymore.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.250
Just one of these
memory cards.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.917
And there is one of
those in the camera.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.583
Ooh, let me see.

10:57.583 --> 10:58.583
[screams]

10:59.750 --> 11:01.583
You know, I probably
deserved that.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.125
So, you think
the race is over yet?

11:07.125 --> 11:08.250
Yeah, probably.
