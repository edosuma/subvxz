WEBVTT

00:01.901 --> 00:03.871
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.903 --> 00:06.440
You're fired.

00:10.211 --> 00:14.147
(growling)

00:14.182 --> 00:17.117
(eerie groaning)

00:23.356 --> 00:24.757
(growling)

00:27.295 --> 00:29.829
Obscurate nos
 non diutius.

00:29.862 --> 00:32.500
(wind howling)

00:32.533 --> 00:35.268
(grumbling)

00:35.302 --> 00:37.003
(grunting)

00:37.036 --> 00:39.939
(Buffy groaning softly,
low growling)

00:39.972 --> 00:43.277
(wild yelling)

00:45.912 --> 00:47.747
(Giles groans)
Now!

00:47.780 --> 00:51.018
(screaming)
(grunts)

00:51.051 --> 00:53.753
(grunts)
(pained yelling)

00:53.786 --> 00:57.390
(Giles groans softly)

00:58.558 --> 01:01.161
I think that was the last.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.299
Oh, Willow, you okay?

01:05.331 --> 01:06.966
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.637
The-the shaking is...
is a side effect of the fear.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.539
Thank you.
Well, if it wasn't
for that clouding spell...

01:12.573 --> 01:15.242
Yeah, it went good.
Nothing melted like last time.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.710
FAITH:
These babes

01:16.743 --> 01:19.480
were wicked rowdy.
What's their deal?

01:19.513 --> 01:22.450
I wish I knew.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.085
Most of my sources
have dried up since

01:25.118 --> 01:27.254
the Council has relieved me
of my duties.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.055
I was aware
that there was

01:29.088 --> 01:31.224
a nest here, but quite frankly,
I expected it to be

01:31.259 --> 01:34.462
vampires. These-these are new.
And improved.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.929
Yes, well, I'm-I'm sorry.
I should have had you

01:35.962 --> 01:37.730
better prepared,
and I should never

01:37.765 --> 01:40.000
have allowed Willow and, uh...

01:40.033 --> 01:42.770
and, uh...

01:42.802 --> 01:45.305
Oh.

01:45.338 --> 01:48.108
I'm good. We're fine.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.579
Just a little bit dirty.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.480
Good show, everyone.
Just great.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.950
I think we have a hit.

01:56.984 --> 02:01.855
Are you okay?
Tip-top, really. If anyone

02:01.888 --> 02:05.259
sees my spine laying around,
just try not to step on it.
BUFFY: Xander, one

02:05.293 --> 02:07.093
of these days,
you're gonna get yourself hurt.

02:07.126 --> 02:09.697
Or killed.
Yeah, or both.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.665
And, you know, with the pain
and then the death,

02:12.699 --> 02:15.102
maybe you shouldn't be
leaping into the fray like that.

02:15.134 --> 02:17.805
Maybe you should be...
fray-adjacent.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.307
Excuse me? Who,
at a crucial moment, distracted

02:20.341 --> 02:23.143
the lead demon by allowing her
to pummel him about the head?

02:23.176 --> 02:26.447
Yeah. That was real manly
how you shrieked and all.
XANDER: I think

02:26.479 --> 02:27.715
you'll find
that was more of a bellow.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.449
BUFFY:
Uh, what should we do

02:29.483 --> 02:31.451
with the trio here?
Should we burn them?
I brought

02:31.485 --> 02:34.153
marshmallows.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.990
Occasionally,
I'm callous and strange.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.526
I expect we can leave them. Uh,

02:39.560 --> 02:41.295
I'm more interested in
finding out what they are,

02:41.329 --> 02:44.131
and-and whether we can expect
more of their kind.

02:44.163 --> 02:46.199
I hope not.
They're way too fit.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.668
I say

02:47.700 --> 02:49.069
bring 'em on!

02:49.102 --> 02:51.372
Uh, Xander, yes, um,
I think in the future,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.473
perhaps it would be best
if you, uh,

02:53.507 --> 02:57.009
hung back to the rear of the
battle, for-for your own sake.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.512
But, gee, Mr. White,

02:58.545 --> 03:00.180
if Clark and Lois get
all the good stories,

03:00.213 --> 03:03.050
I'll never be
a good reporter.
Hmm?

03:03.082 --> 03:05.419
Jimmy Olsen joke, sir. Pretty
much gonna be lost on you, huh?

03:05.453 --> 03:07.888
Sorry.
Hey, it's okay.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.026
(wolf howling)

03:13.060 --> 03:15.194
*

04:06.013 --> 04:07.781
(indistinct crowd chatter)

04:12.652 --> 04:15.489
XANDER:
Hey, Doug, toss me one!

04:19.427 --> 04:20.761
Les-man, I'm open!

04:20.793 --> 04:22.329
Les, buddy!

04:22.362 --> 04:25.565
Doug, right here, man.
Right here.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.701
Doug, please.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.903
All right!
It's all me!

04:30.937 --> 04:32.204
(groans)

04:37.644 --> 04:39.747
Boy, I am so sorry.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.949
Doug's arm is kind
of like spaghetti.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.117
(laughs) We're all so
very sad for him.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.519
Is your lunch okay?

04:45.552 --> 04:47.521
What are you, retarded?

04:47.555 --> 04:49.689
No. No, I had to take that
test when I was seven.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.124
A little slow in some stuff--

04:51.158 --> 04:52.759
mostly math and
spatial relations--

04:52.793 --> 04:55.194
but certainly not
challenged or anything.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.797
Can I get you
another soda?

04:56.829 --> 04:59.098
I ought to cut your face open.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.201
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. It
was an accident. Cool down.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.708
You want to be
startin' somethin'?

05:07.740 --> 05:09.843
What? Starting something?

05:09.877 --> 05:12.178
Like that Michael
Jackson song, right?

05:12.211 --> 05:13.781
That was a lot of fun.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.516
* Too high to get
over, yeah, yeah. *

05:16.550 --> 05:18.018
Remember that fun song?

05:18.050 --> 05:20.987
I get my buddies together,
we're gonna kick your ass

05:21.021 --> 05:25.759
till it's a brand-new shape.
Now get out of here.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.332
MAN:
Yo, man, the ball!

05:33.367 --> 05:36.670
Boy, of all the humiliations
you've had I've witnessed,

05:36.704 --> 05:39.305
that was the latest.
I could've taken him.

05:39.338 --> 05:42.074
Oh, please. O'Toole
would macramÃ© your face.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.843
He is a psycho,

05:43.877 --> 05:46.012
which is still a lot
cooler than being a wuss.

05:46.045 --> 05:50.216
Why is it that I've come
face-to-face with vampires,

05:50.250 --> 05:52.853
demons, the most hideous
creatures hell ever spit out,

05:52.886 --> 05:55.055
and I'm still afraid of a little
bully like Jack O'Toole?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.590
Because, unlike
all those other

05:56.624 --> 05:58.492
creatures that you've
come face-to-face with,

05:58.526 --> 06:00.894
Jack actually noticed
you were there.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.930
Why am I surprised by how
comforting you're not?

06:02.963 --> 06:05.331
It must be really hard
when all your friends have,

06:05.365 --> 06:09.569
like, superpowers-- slayer,
werewolf, witches, vampires--

06:09.603 --> 06:11.204
and you're like
this little nothing.

06:11.237 --> 06:15.274
You must feel
like Jimmy Olsen.

06:15.307 --> 06:17.009
I was just talking to...
Hey, mind your own business.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.379
Ooh, I struck a nerve.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.714
The boy that had no cool.
I happen to be

06:21.749 --> 06:23.550
an integral part of that group.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.351
I happen to have a lot to offer.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.086
Oh, please.
I do!

06:27.120 --> 06:29.723
"Integral part"
of the group? Xander,

06:29.757 --> 06:32.091
you're the-the useless part
of the group.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.726
You're the Zeppo.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.697
"Cool." Look it up.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.899
It's something
that a subliterate

06:38.932 --> 06:42.802
that's repeated 12th grade
three times has and you don't.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.509
There was no part of that
that wasn't fun.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.547
(food hissing)

06:53.581 --> 06:55.983
XANDER:
But it's just
that it's bugging me--

06:56.016 --> 06:58.619
this "cool" thing. I mean,

06:58.651 --> 07:01.420
what is it? How do you get it?

07:01.454 --> 07:05.959
Who doesn't have it, and who
decides who doesn't have it?

07:05.992 --> 07:07.995
What is the essence of cool?

07:08.028 --> 07:10.396
Not sure.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.966
I mean, you yourself, Oz, are
considered more or less cool.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.401
Why is that?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.838
Am I?
Is it about
the talking?

07:17.870 --> 07:19.973
You know, the way you tend
to express yourself

07:20.007 --> 07:21.574
in short, noncommittal phrases?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.843
It could be.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.278
No. You're in a band.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.314
That's like a business-class
ticket to cool

07:28.348 --> 07:30.617
with complimentary
mojo after takeoff.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.084
I got to learn
an instrument.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.920
Is it hard to play guitar?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.422
Not the way I play it.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.824
Okay, but on the other
hand-- eighth grade.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.826
I'm taking the flugelhorn
and getting zero trim,

07:39.860 --> 07:42.295
so the whole instrument
thing could be a mislead.

07:42.329 --> 07:46.867
But you need a thing--
one thing nobody else has.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.802
What do I have?

07:48.836 --> 07:50.803
An exciting new obsession,

07:50.838 --> 07:53.273
which I feel makes you
very special.

07:53.305 --> 07:55.307
Now with the mocking.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.678
Which I can handle because I
know I'm right about this.

07:58.711 --> 08:03.050
I'm on the track.
I just need to find my thing.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.151
It seems like
you're overthinking it.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.721
I mean, you got some
identity issues. It's not...

08:07.754 --> 08:09.156
The end of the world?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.524
Can they do that?

08:10.557 --> 08:12.192
They seem fairly
committed.

08:13.761 --> 08:18.365
The Sisterhood of Jhe,
an Apocalypse cult.

08:18.398 --> 08:21.468
They exist solely to bring
about the world's destruction,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.971
and we've not seen the last
of them. More will follow.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.074
And they're here in Sunnydale
for what, Demon Expo?

08:27.106 --> 08:29.475
Buffy, this is no
laughing matter.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.478
Hence my no laughing.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.746
I'm sorry.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.082
I know I'm no longer your
official watcher, but...

08:36.115 --> 08:37.484
(door opens)

08:37.517 --> 08:38.918
Hey.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.754
Hey.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.691
Um, you're-you're-you're
cutting it a bit close.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.125
Well, you know me.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.600
Well, do we know
why they're here?

08:52.633 --> 08:55.368
I think so. Based
on some artifacts

08:55.402 --> 08:57.169
that I-I found with them,

08:57.203 --> 09:01.774
and, uh, um, taking into account
the current astral cycle...

09:01.808 --> 09:04.812
Giles, I don't need
to see the math.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.119
They intend to
open the Hellmouth.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.556
The Hellmouth.
The one that opens...

09:16.590 --> 09:21.227
About 20 feet from
where you're standing.

09:25.298 --> 09:29.602
(grunting, loud chuffing)

09:29.636 --> 09:31.538
(howling)

09:31.571 --> 09:34.474
And if it opens?

09:34.506 --> 09:37.911
Do you remember the demon that
almost got out the night I died?
Every

09:37.945 --> 09:40.713
nightmare I have that doesn't
revolve around academic failure

09:40.748 --> 09:43.049
or public nudity
is about that thing.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.786
In fact, once I dreamt
that it attacked me

09:45.818 --> 09:48.321
while I was late
for a test and naked.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.624
Well, it'll be
the first to come out,

09:50.658 --> 09:54.293
and Giles says it won't
be the worst by a long shot.

09:54.326 --> 09:58.230
The world will be overrun with
demons if we don't stop it.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.134
Do we know when this
is supposed to happen?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.636
Giles is trying
to narrow it down.

10:03.671 --> 10:07.440
If you're up for it, we're
heading into deep research mode.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.778
I'd be offended if you
haven't already counted me in.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.913
Thanks, Will. There's something
about this one that...

10:13.947 --> 10:15.749
scares me.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.283
I need my Willow.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.985
Oh, you don't
have to be afraid.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.519
(loud beeping)
(gasps)
XANDER: You girls

10:20.552 --> 10:21.955
need a lift?

10:21.989 --> 10:24.323
(rock music playing
over car radio)

10:24.356 --> 10:26.326
What is this?

10:26.359 --> 10:27.927
What do you mean,
what is it?

10:27.961 --> 10:31.498
It's my thing.
Your thing?

10:31.530 --> 10:33.033
My thing!

10:33.066 --> 10:34.600
Is this a penis metaphor?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.669
It's my thing
that makes me cool.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.370
You know, that makes me unique.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.874
I'm "car guy"--
guy with the car.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.809
How can you
afford it?

10:42.842 --> 10:44.443
Uncle Roary,
stacking up the DUIs,

10:44.476 --> 10:46.513
let me rent this bad boy
till he's mobile again.

10:46.546 --> 10:49.149
(turns radio off)

10:49.182 --> 10:52.019
Well, it-it's nice.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.788
Could you sound
a little less enthused?

10:54.822 --> 10:56.288
Sorry.
Evil.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.024
Big?
Biggest.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.726
Maybe more than I can handle.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.328
Then we'll handle it together.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.663
You know I'm here for you.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.333
Just tell me what I can do.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.235
I'll take two glazed,
two cinnamon,

11:09.269 --> 11:10.803
couple cream-filled
and a jelly.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.972
No, no, no, let's round that out
to four jellies.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.707
Ooh, is some evil
going on?

11:14.741 --> 11:16.710
Must be big for them
to entrust you

11:16.744 --> 11:18.477
with this
daredevil mission.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.312
Cordelia. Feel free
to drop dead

11:20.346 --> 11:22.816
of a wasting disease
in the next 20 seconds.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.517
Ooh, again,
I strike the nerve.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.721
I am the surgeon of mean.
I'm kind of busy
right now, okay?

11:27.754 --> 11:29.355
Right. Buffy need your help?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.357
Can you say "expendable"?

11:31.390 --> 11:33.225
You think you
know everything.

11:33.259 --> 11:36.328
I think I know you.
That's a laugh.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.198
Oh, what, you got a shiny car,
and now you're someone new?

11:39.231 --> 11:42.469
Like anybody
even cares about...
WOMAN:
Is that your car?

11:44.303 --> 11:47.506
Why, uh... yes, it is.

11:47.539 --> 11:50.509
'57 Chevy Bel Aire.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.178
283 C.I.D.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.783
Solid lifter, fuel-injected V-8.

11:55.816 --> 11:59.119
Uh... very possibly.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.720
How does she handle?

12:00.754 --> 12:04.323
Like a dream about
warm, sticky things.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.863
Would you like to go
for a little drive?
You busy?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.563
Just got to drop
this stuff off,

12:11.597 --> 12:15.001
and then I would describe
myself as... expendable.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.140
MAN:
Oh, that's fine.
Thanks, Bob.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.044
Oh!

12:25.077 --> 12:26.879
Come on. Come on.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.280
There.
(clears his throat)

12:28.315 --> 12:30.283
(engine starting)

12:30.317 --> 12:32.585
(tires squealing, engine revs)

12:32.619 --> 12:36.123
*

12:36.155 --> 12:39.826
And then, you know, I
started seeing Ben Peck.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.162
Had a Thunderbird, engine
completely tricked out,

12:42.195 --> 12:44.431
but the upholstery
was kind of shot.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.298
So then I started
seeing his friend Mike.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.000
Not the Mike with the Mercedes.
The Mike with the Mustang.

12:48.034 --> 12:51.738
An '82 V-6. You
know the look.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.472
Angel!

12:53.505 --> 12:56.176
Buddy! Friend-buddy.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.411
You want to sit and talk?

12:58.445 --> 13:01.347
I'm looking for Buffy.
Library last I saw.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.517
Something's happening.
I've seen portents.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.919
The Apocalypse.
They're on top of it.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.288
I don't think they know
what they're dealing with.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.359
Let's go there...
and tell them that.
No.

13:12.392 --> 13:16.663
It's best you stay out
of harm's way.
But I can help.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.764
WOMAN:
Hey, you want

13:18.798 --> 13:21.801
to go for another drive?

13:25.304 --> 13:27.639
You know, it's not like
I haven't helped before.

13:27.673 --> 13:30.442
You know, I've done some quality
violence for those people.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.080
Do they even think about that?

13:34.881 --> 13:36.283
I mean...

13:36.316 --> 13:37.884
(car engine starts)

13:37.918 --> 13:39.786
They act like I'm... like
I'm some sort of klutz.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.054
(metal clanking, thudding)
Whoa!

13:42.088 --> 13:43.822
Oh, God, are
you all right?

13:43.856 --> 13:46.994
Oh, God.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.727
Stay calm.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.330
Little fender bender.
It's not...

13:50.363 --> 13:51.764
(car door opens)

13:55.701 --> 13:58.504
...the end of the world.

14:03.409 --> 14:07.014
(low growling)

14:11.551 --> 14:13.653
He's cranky.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.389
It's a good
night for it.

14:16.423 --> 14:21.327
Can't dogs sense when there's
an earthquake, and they bark?

14:21.360 --> 14:24.496
Or cows lie down
or something?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.499
"Sisterhood of Jhe."

14:26.533 --> 14:29.201
"Race of female demons,
fierce warriors..."

14:29.235 --> 14:34.240
Ew. "...celebrate victory
in battle by eating their foes."

14:34.274 --> 14:36.275
They couldn't just pour
Gatorade on each other?

14:36.308 --> 14:39.379
Council wouldn't even take
my calls. Idiots.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.548
Anything useful in the books?

14:41.581 --> 14:44.250
Not wildly.
WILLOW:
We still have the

14:44.283 --> 14:46.852
Books of Pherion to go through.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.254
I'm getting itchy feet, Giles.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.788
If we don't turn up
something soon,

14:49.822 --> 14:51.959
I'm gonna hit the streets,
maybe check out Willy's.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.193
Fine.
Where are you going?

14:54.226 --> 14:57.429
Um, to try and contact
the spirit guides.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.767
They exist out of time, but
have knowledge of the future.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.802
I have no idea
if they will respond

15:02.835 --> 15:04.636
to my efforts,
but I have to try.

15:04.671 --> 15:08.441
All we know is that the fate
of the entire world rests on it.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.278
Did you eat all the jellies?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.615
Did you want a jelly?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.417
I always have a jelly.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.918
I'm always the one that says,
"Let's have a jelly in the mix."

15:19.952 --> 15:22.654
We're sorry. Buffy had three.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.792
No matter.

15:25.825 --> 15:28.061
If Xander makes another run...

15:28.095 --> 15:29.796
No. Xander's
out of this.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.563
He nearly got killed
last time we fought.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.399
This whole thing will be easier
if we know he's safe.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.801
XANDER:
 Oh, gosh, Jack.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.636
Are you okay?

15:37.669 --> 15:39.639
I am really sorry
about that,

15:39.672 --> 15:41.807
but your car came
out of nowhere.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.476
I was parked.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.346
Exactly. Look, I can
cover the damages.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.649
I don't have insurance in

15:49.682 --> 15:51.750
the strictest sense of the word,
but I have a.... a little money.

15:51.783 --> 15:53.986
But the important thing
is is that we're all right,

15:54.020 --> 15:57.490
and we can work this out
like two reasonable...

15:57.524 --> 16:00.659
frontiersmen.
Where do you want it?

16:00.692 --> 16:02.528
What?

16:02.562 --> 16:03.962
Where do you want it?

16:03.996 --> 16:06.099
I'm fairly certain
I don't want it at all,

16:06.133 --> 16:08.168
but, uh, thank you.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.538
Wow. Cool knife.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.605
Yeah. Great knife.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.376
Although I think, um, it
may technically be a-a sword.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.945
She's called "Katie."

16:18.977 --> 16:20.980
You gave it a girl's name.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.816
How very serial killer of you.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.519
Listen, I think
we should be going.

16:26.552 --> 16:29.655
Are you scared?

16:29.688 --> 16:31.823
Would that make you happy?

16:31.857 --> 16:35.727
Your woman looking on,
you can't stand up to me?

16:35.761 --> 16:37.697
Don't you feel pathetic?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.732
Uh, mostly I feel Katie.

16:42.369 --> 16:46.038
You know what the difference
between you and me is?

16:46.072 --> 16:49.076
Again... Katie's
springing to mind.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.177
Fear.

16:52.611 --> 16:54.713
Who has the least fear.

16:54.746 --> 16:58.717
And it has nothing to do
with who has the big, sharp...

16:59.918 --> 17:01.421
Come on.

17:01.453 --> 17:04.356
WOMAN:
I want to go
for a drive.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.723
I'm bored.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.527
Oh, gee, I'm really sorry

17:07.559 --> 17:09.761
my life-and-death situation
isn't exciting enough for you.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.733
MAN:
Hey!

17:15.768 --> 17:17.237
What's going on?

17:17.269 --> 17:20.740
Nothing. Just rasslin'.

17:20.771 --> 17:24.041
O'Toole.
(chuckles)

17:24.076 --> 17:27.046
What a surprise.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.583
He attack you?

17:32.318 --> 17:37.289
No. Just blowing off steam.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.759
Two guys rasslin'...
but not in a gay way.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.162
Do it somewhere else, huh?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.201
What?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.602
That was
all right.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.070
Could've narked on me.
Didn't do it.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.940
That's decent of you.

17:55.807 --> 17:58.076
I like you.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.381
Yay?
You two

18:01.413 --> 18:03.115
want to have some fun?
WOMAN:
Like,

18:03.150 --> 18:06.419
with driving?
Yeah.

18:06.452 --> 18:08.555
What do you have in mind?

18:08.587 --> 18:13.625
I was on my way to get the boys.
Gonna cruise around.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.628
We'll take your wheels.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.765
What about your car?

18:18.798 --> 18:20.666
It ain't mine.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.938
Great. Where to?

18:25.971 --> 18:28.307
Gonna get the boys!

18:28.340 --> 18:30.609
Yeah.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.077
(engine starts)

18:32.111 --> 18:34.113
So, where are the boys?

18:36.316 --> 18:41.288
JACK:
He calls forth the Spirit
of Uurthu, The Restless.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.756
No one shall speak.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.857
He shall arise!

18:45.892 --> 18:49.296
Hear me. The blood of

18:49.328 --> 18:51.163
the earth shall restore him.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.805
And he shall arise.

18:58.837 --> 19:02.842
Shall arise.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.685
Buddy.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.188
Bob.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.689
You big, hideous

19:16.722 --> 19:18.657
corpse. Come here!

19:19.692 --> 19:23.363
(screaming)
Ah! (laughing)

19:23.395 --> 19:25.397
I'll call ya!

19:25.432 --> 19:27.366
(laughter)

19:27.400 --> 19:29.969
Man, you raised me!

19:30.001 --> 19:32.572
I told you grandpappy
could work that mojo.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.540
Big Bob is back in action!

19:34.574 --> 19:36.209
Yes!
BOTH:
Dah!

19:36.242 --> 19:38.911
Oh, man, I can't
believe you raised me.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.347
That is so awesome!

19:42.548 --> 19:44.483
You are
the coolest.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.554
Maybe I should just
let you guys catch up.

19:47.586 --> 19:51.258
Bob, this is Xander.
He's our wheel man.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.559
Hey.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.228
Howdy.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.762
Dude, where are
the other guys?

19:56.796 --> 19:58.197
We got to go get 'em.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.598
Absolutely.
All right.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.835
Are, um...
are all your friends dead?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.936
Xander, let's roll.
How long I been down?

20:04.971 --> 20:07.073
Eight months. I had to wait
till the stars aligned.

20:07.105 --> 20:09.008
Oh, eight months.
I got some catching up to do.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.109
Whoa. Walker, Texas Ranger--
you been taping 'em?

20:11.143 --> 20:12.545
Every ep.
All right.

20:12.578 --> 20:13.945
We're gonna get
the guys together,

20:13.980 --> 20:15.382
and we're gonna
party, man!

20:15.414 --> 20:18.250
It's gonna be
a night to remember! Yeah!

20:18.285 --> 20:19.685
I'm sensing that.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.554
JACK:
 The blood of the earth

20:21.587 --> 20:24.957
shall restore him,
and he shall arise.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.296
Oh, dudes!
(laughs)

20:29.328 --> 20:31.397
Beer!
(tires squealing)

20:38.938 --> 20:40.606
(speaking Latin)

21:05.263 --> 21:07.866
(wind howling)

21:15.007 --> 21:17.108
XANDER:
Giles, hey.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.412
What's going on?

21:19.445 --> 21:25.116
Oh, uh, I was just trying to,
uh, gain access to, the, uh,

21:25.151 --> 21:27.153
the spirit guides.
Not going very well, I'm afraid.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.288
Uh, what are
you doing here?

21:29.321 --> 21:33.125
Oh, we were just raising,
um... some heck.

21:33.159 --> 21:34.527
JACK:
Xander!

21:34.560 --> 21:36.828
Let's go!

21:37.963 --> 21:40.432
Listen, do you guys
need any help?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.669
Hmm? Oh, no. Thank you.

21:42.701 --> 21:47.138
Uh, probably best
if you-you stay out of trouble.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.775
No chance of that.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.143
Xander! Motor!

21:51.176 --> 21:56.516
There's something...
different about this. Menace.

21:56.548 --> 22:00.619
Something in the air--
the stench of death.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.188
Yeah, I think it's Bob.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.556
We may all be called upon

22:03.589 --> 22:04.990
to fight when it happens.

22:05.023 --> 22:09.161
When what happens, exactly?
Come on!

22:09.194 --> 22:11.297
I better go. Um, hopefully,
we should have time to prepare.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.833
All we need is a few weeks.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.634
Tonight?

22:15.667 --> 22:17.202
Before sunrise.

22:17.236 --> 22:20.038
That's what they said.

22:20.071 --> 22:21.874
Why did they do this?

22:21.907 --> 22:23.308
They were looking for Angel.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.711
Angel? Why?

22:25.744 --> 22:27.814
They said they were
coming after you, too,

22:27.846 --> 22:29.848
nothing could stand
in their way because

22:29.882 --> 22:31.250
tonight was the night.

22:31.282 --> 22:32.884
(wheezes, coughs)
Oh, man.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.320
The ambulance
is on its way.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.323
(coughs)

22:37.355 --> 22:40.992
Look, kid, my clientele ain't
exactly nuns and orphans, but...

22:41.027 --> 22:43.663
I... I never seen anything
like these demons.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.666
I'm gonna stop them.
(coughs)

22:47.700 --> 22:49.335
That Hellmouth opens...

22:49.367 --> 22:51.671
they're gonna be the
least of your problems

22:51.703 --> 22:53.204
is my train of thought.

22:53.239 --> 22:56.342
(wheezes, coughs)

22:56.375 --> 23:00.211
If I were you...
I'd go find Angel...

23:00.246 --> 23:03.849
Go somewhere
quiet together.

23:03.883 --> 23:08.019
I'd be thinking about how I want
to spend my last night on earth.

23:08.054 --> 23:12.023
Let's get some beer!
(loud rock music playing)

23:12.057 --> 23:13.726
Yeah!

23:13.759 --> 23:15.361
Let's go pick up

23:15.394 --> 23:17.363
some girls, man.
We'll hang out

23:17.395 --> 23:19.230
at Taco Bell,
get some girls,

23:19.265 --> 23:20.567
go cruise around.

23:20.599 --> 23:21.968
(laughter)

23:22.000 --> 23:23.435
I want to bake a cake.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.371
Hey, we need some beers, though.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.138
I can't believe

23:27.173 --> 23:29.541
you got shot, man.
Was it them Jackals?

23:29.576 --> 23:31.309
Are you kidding?
We wiped them out

23:31.343 --> 23:33.244
after they threw you
off the bridge.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.146
Oh, man, you guys... you
guys are the best, man.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.615
The best! I mean
that. I mean.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.250
There's a liquor store.

23:38.284 --> 23:40.051
A little Armenian guy
runs the place?

23:40.086 --> 23:42.121
He had a gun
behind the counter.

23:44.691 --> 23:48.494
Hey... we should
go kick his ass!

23:48.528 --> 23:50.296
Yeah!
 Yeah!

23:50.328 --> 23:52.064
Yeah.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.933
If you guys want me to drop
you off somewhere, that's...

23:54.967 --> 23:56.603
Nah. You're with us now.
Oh, yeah, man.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.436
You on the team now, baby.
(whoops)

23:58.471 --> 24:00.807
(laughing)

24:00.839 --> 24:02.474
What are we gonna do?
Well, I've heard

24:02.509 --> 24:03.910
some interesting suggestions,

24:03.942 --> 24:05.944
but I'm gonna have to go
with Dickie's--

24:05.978 --> 24:08.279
let's bake a cake.
Yeah!
Yeah!

24:08.314 --> 24:11.116
(laughter)

24:11.150 --> 24:14.252
(whooping and laughter)

24:14.286 --> 24:17.923
All right. You stay here
and keep the motor running.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.959
This time of night,
I'm pretty sure nothing's open.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.798
But they're always
open for crime.

24:30.869 --> 24:34.440
Okay. Now I'm involved in crime.

24:34.472 --> 24:36.542
I'm the criminal element.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.510
Having a car sure is cool.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.445
WILLOW:
Thank you. Sorry
to wake you.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.515
No problem.
Will!

24:46.051 --> 24:48.887
Xander, what are you doing here?

24:48.921 --> 24:50.690
Nothing. Certainly not crime.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.124
(chuckles)

24:52.157 --> 24:53.726
Uh, what-what about you?

24:53.759 --> 24:55.627
I needed supplies for
a protection spell.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.964
Buffy called from Angel's.
It's happening tonight.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.701
And that thing
that's happening would be...?

25:01.733 --> 25:04.103
I-I can't stay.
Buffy'll need this.

25:08.907 --> 25:10.942
I love you, Xander.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.717
Okay, that's it. I'm gonna...

25:17.750 --> 25:20.152
Where are you going?

25:20.185 --> 25:21.854
Look, something's
just come up.

25:21.887 --> 25:24.490
You gonna bail on me,
is that it?

25:24.522 --> 25:27.526
We got cake mix.
Where you want to bake it?

25:27.559 --> 25:29.060
Xander's looking
to leave.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.528
No way.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.198
We need

25:32.230 --> 25:34.834
a wheel man.
Xander doesn't feel
like he's part

25:34.866 --> 25:36.769
of the group.
No. It's just
I'm kind of busy.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.738
He doesn't feel like
part of the group

25:38.770 --> 25:42.240
because he hasn't
been initiated.
Do you think
he's ready?

25:42.273 --> 25:44.009
Well, I think
he's earned his stripes.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.845
I say we let him in, boys, huh?

25:45.877 --> 25:48.013
(Xander laughs)

25:48.047 --> 25:50.583
Great. I want to be
in the gang, sure.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.451
All right!
Yeah.

25:52.483 --> 25:54.385
That's the spirit.
Yeah.

25:54.420 --> 25:55.922
What do I got to do?

25:59.125 --> 26:00.459
You got to die.

26:00.491 --> 26:02.828
Oh.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.971
All right, guys, what?
Let's just talk about this.

26:12.003 --> 26:14.405
Now, you want to be part
of the gang now, don't you?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.875
XANDER:
Yes, yes, but I'm not

26:16.909 --> 26:19.778
but I'm not dying to be in
the gang, if you get the, um...

26:19.811 --> 26:21.547
the pun there.

26:21.579 --> 26:24.651
What, you... you
too good to be dead?

26:27.086 --> 26:29.221
You got a problem
with dead people?

26:29.255 --> 26:32.157
What about Jack?
Jack's not dead.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.095
(Jack laughs)

26:38.765 --> 26:40.432
Drive-by three weeks ago.

26:40.465 --> 26:42.233
Oh, boy.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.935
Grandpappy
found my body.

26:43.970 --> 26:47.740
I wasn't gone but ten minutes
before he raised me.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.240
It's a rush, man.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.777
Let's kill Xander.

26:50.809 --> 26:53.612
It'll be fun.
Yeah, man. You can be
a full-fledged

26:53.645 --> 26:55.314
member then.
Come on, Xander.

26:55.346 --> 26:58.183
Take it like a man.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.585
All right. Enough.

26:59.617 --> 27:00.952
You guys have
had your fun,

27:00.987 --> 27:04.355
but you forgot
about one thing.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.291
Get him!

27:14.733 --> 27:19.605
(engine starts, tires squealing,
engine revving)

27:19.637 --> 27:21.039
Damn!

27:21.073 --> 27:23.342
There goes the wheels.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.676
He took all our stuff, man.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.211
I want to bake a cake.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.779
It's all right.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.816
We'll get more.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.917
The night is young.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.221
I'd say that's pretty much

27:36.255 --> 27:37.957
enough excitement
for one evening.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.492
(grunting, growling)

27:44.529 --> 27:47.566
(groaning)

27:47.598 --> 27:51.269
(growling, grunting)

27:52.939 --> 27:54.740
(tires squealing)

27:58.176 --> 28:00.645
(growling, grunting)

28:00.679 --> 28:02.381
(engine revving)

28:02.413 --> 28:04.916
(tires squealing, groaning)

28:04.951 --> 28:07.086
(tires squealing)

28:07.118 --> 28:08.487
(growling)
Get in!

28:08.519 --> 28:11.222
Get in.
(tires squealing)

28:11.257 --> 28:14.326
(engine revving, growling)

28:14.359 --> 28:15.928
(growling)

28:17.128 --> 28:19.565
(tires squeak)

28:25.570 --> 28:27.673
You think demon mama
followed us?

28:27.705 --> 28:29.240
No, we're cool.

28:29.275 --> 28:32.211
The bitch dislocated
my shoulder, though.

28:32.243 --> 28:33.711
(sighs)

28:33.746 --> 28:35.280
Hold me.

28:42.421 --> 28:45.356
(sighs)

28:45.391 --> 28:46.959
(Faith grunts, bones click)

28:46.992 --> 28:49.560
(sighs)

28:49.595 --> 28:50.930
That's better.

28:50.962 --> 28:52.364
(sniffles)

28:52.397 --> 28:54.732
She got me really wound up.

28:57.936 --> 28:59.305
(sighs)

28:59.337 --> 29:02.574
A fight like that and...
no kill...

29:02.607 --> 29:07.645
I'm about ready to pop.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.480
Really?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.151
Pop?

29:12.183 --> 29:14.153
You up for it?

29:14.185 --> 29:16.587
Oh, I'm up.

29:18.656 --> 29:20.826
Mmm.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.630
I'm suddenly very up.

29:24.663 --> 29:27.232
It's just, um...

29:27.266 --> 29:30.469
I've never been up
with people before.

29:33.172 --> 29:36.342
(sighs)

29:36.375 --> 29:37.977
Just relax.

29:38.009 --> 29:39.846
And take your pants off.

29:39.878 --> 29:43.849
Those two concepts
are antithetical.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.455
(moaning)

29:55.693 --> 29:57.796
Don't worry.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.633
I'll steer you
around the curves.

30:01.666 --> 30:04.202
Did I mention that I'm having
a very strange night?

30:24.655 --> 30:27.792
That was great.
I got to shower.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.229
(crickets chirping)

30:36.102 --> 30:37.802
(growling)

30:37.836 --> 30:39.471
I've never seen him like this.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.007
It's the Hellmouth.

30:41.039 --> 30:44.643
He can sense it's going to open.
Be ready just in case.

30:44.675 --> 30:47.145
(growling)
Now don't hesitate.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.815
Do it.

30:49.847 --> 30:52.683
Now Oz...
(Oz growls, Giles yells)

30:52.718 --> 30:54.819
(Oz yelping)
Again!

30:54.853 --> 30:57.355
(growling)

30:57.388 --> 30:58.656
(whimpering)

30:58.690 --> 31:00.526
(growling)

31:00.558 --> 31:01.993
Now.

31:02.028 --> 31:05.263
(yelps, chuffing)

31:05.297 --> 31:08.334
We've got to move him
before he wakes up.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.001
Sorry.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.337
I hope you're not mad
at me in the morning.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.739
(soft groaning)

31:13.771 --> 31:16.142
(crickets chirping)

31:23.281 --> 31:25.717
(sighs)

31:43.001 --> 31:45.636
Hey.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.074
They're not baking any cake.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.542
(car engine starts)

31:51.576 --> 31:53.980
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

31:54.012 --> 31:56.615
(brakes squeak)

31:56.647 --> 31:58.549
Long gone.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.853
Probably loaded with supplies.
Got to think.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.324
I can't believe I had sex.

32:05.356 --> 32:09.560
Okay. Bombs.
Already-dead guys with bombs.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.262
Oh, man. I'm out of my league.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.763
Buffy will know what to do.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.566
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

32:14.599 --> 32:17.368
I don't know what to do.
Then let me decide for you.

32:18.804 --> 32:20.506
I can face this thing.

32:20.538 --> 32:22.907
You can't.
Look, I can at
least buy you

32:22.941 --> 32:24.910
enough time for Willow's
spell to bind it.

32:24.942 --> 32:29.315
Buffy, this is worse than
anything we've ever faced.

32:29.347 --> 32:32.351
Honey, it's the only way.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.987
I can't watch you die again.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.654
Hey.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.291
I love you.

32:41.527 --> 32:42.927
I love you.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.296
Nothing can
change that.

32:44.329 --> 32:47.032
Not even death.
(gasps)

32:47.066 --> 32:48.933
Don't talk to me like that!

32:48.967 --> 32:52.671
You may be ready to go,
but I am not ready to lose you.

32:52.703 --> 32:54.772
Okay, this is my fight, and

32:54.806 --> 32:56.442
if you won't do it
my way, then you're...

32:56.474 --> 32:59.211
(throat clearing)

32:59.244 --> 33:01.346
Hey.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.548
I've got this, um...

33:03.582 --> 33:07.786
There's this, uh...

33:07.818 --> 33:09.488
(bird calling)

33:09.520 --> 33:11.923
It's probably a bad time.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.662
Can I help?

33:20.165 --> 33:22.433
Okay.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.777
(panting)

33:33.412 --> 33:35.713
Okay, I can work this out.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.750
I just got to figure out
what they'd be likely to bomb.

33:43.055 --> 33:45.891
GILES:
 Terra, vente, ignis et pluvia.

33:45.923 --> 33:51.730
Cuncta quattuor numina,
 vos obsecro.

33:51.762 --> 33:57.336
Defendete nos
 a recente malo resoluto.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.439
Okay. Oz is moved.

34:00.471 --> 34:02.874
He could barely walk after
that mickey I gave him,

34:02.907 --> 34:04.843
but we made it.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.845
Is he going to be
all right there?

34:06.877 --> 34:10.282
Anywhere's safer than here.
Um, help me with the candles.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.784
We're doing a binding spell

34:12.818 --> 34:14.253
from the Hebron's Almanac?

34:14.286 --> 34:15.786
Yes, but once it's ready,

34:15.820 --> 34:18.556
you're to stay back and let me
finish the recitation.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.527
Don't argue.
I want you safe.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.795
Who knows what's going
to come up from beneath us.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.902
(laughter)

34:32.938 --> 34:34.940
Good.

34:34.972 --> 34:37.309
(beep, whirring)
(whoops)

34:37.342 --> 34:39.077
(beep, whirring)

34:39.110 --> 34:42.447
(sighs)

34:42.481 --> 34:44.081
(beeping)

34:44.114 --> 34:46.485
(laughs)

34:46.518 --> 34:48.454
This is gonna be large.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.789
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
(laughter)

34:59.597 --> 35:01.333
Giles will know what to do.

35:01.367 --> 35:05.170
He's way more calm than Buffy.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.072
(indistinct chatter)

35:07.105 --> 35:09.175
Okay, I need a plan.

35:11.309 --> 35:14.179
Hey, our wheels.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.748
(laughing)

35:16.782 --> 35:18.550
Hey. Hey, hey. Hey!

35:20.219 --> 35:21.853
(tires squealing)

35:21.887 --> 35:23.322
(groaning)

35:23.355 --> 35:25.791
(tires squealing)

35:25.824 --> 35:28.193
(tires squealing, groaning)

35:28.226 --> 35:31.630
Stop. Come on,
man. Stop.
Where's the bomb?

35:31.663 --> 35:33.199
It's-it's in
the high school.

35:33.231 --> 35:34.632
(tires squealing)
In the school where?

35:34.666 --> 35:36.867
Oh, God, this
really, really hurts.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.871
(tires squealing)
Stop!

35:39.905 --> 35:41.773
It's in the... it's in the
boiler room.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.476
All right. Now I'm gonna
ask you this once,

35:44.510 --> 35:47.112
and you better pray
you get the answer right.
Okay, okay.

35:47.144 --> 35:49.547
How do I defuse...
(screams)

35:49.581 --> 35:51.949
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

35:51.983 --> 35:53.952
I probably should've left out
that whole middle part.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.222
(engine revving)

35:56.255 --> 35:58.824
He's headed
for the school!
That's it.

36:04.061 --> 36:05.963
There he is!

36:05.996 --> 36:07.998
Where's a slayer
when you need one?

36:09.335 --> 36:13.672
(growling)

36:13.704 --> 36:16.842
(thunder crashing)
Oh, my God. It's grown.

36:18.409 --> 36:20.378
(Xander whimpering)

36:20.411 --> 36:22.780
(shouting)

36:27.353 --> 36:29.588
Wow.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.489
(growling)

36:31.523 --> 36:33.425
JACK:
Come on, man!

36:40.130 --> 36:42.032
Which way?

36:42.067 --> 36:43.434
He couldn't have gotten far.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.903
Let's split up.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.449
Good for chopping.

37:00.286 --> 37:02.119
(grunting)

37:05.257 --> 37:07.626
(grunting)

37:07.659 --> 37:10.195
Now this is
what I call fun.

37:10.228 --> 37:14.099
(grunting)

37:19.505 --> 37:21.472
(grunts)

37:31.248 --> 37:34.320
Should've learned by now--
if you're gonna play with fire,

37:34.353 --> 37:36.554
you got to expect
sooner or later...

37:36.588 --> 37:38.023
I wasn't finished!

37:39.090 --> 37:40.925
Note to self: less talk.

37:40.958 --> 37:43.594
(grunting)

37:43.628 --> 37:45.664
(growling)

37:45.697 --> 37:47.231
Faith, go for the heart!

37:47.264 --> 37:49.134
(growling)

37:57.275 --> 37:59.244
(whimpering)

37:59.277 --> 38:01.045
(growling)

38:03.849 --> 38:06.784
(yelling)
(growling)

38:08.487 --> 38:10.755
(screaming)

38:10.789 --> 38:14.291
(growling, screaming,
flesh tearing)

38:14.326 --> 38:15.827
(screaming)

38:15.860 --> 38:18.929
Okay, boiler room.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.532
(growling)
Other way.

38:29.340 --> 38:32.811
(panting)

38:32.844 --> 38:36.447
(rhythmic beeping)

38:36.481 --> 38:39.150
Hello, nasty.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.795
Less than two minutes.

38:49.827 --> 38:53.664
Dumb guy. Little bomb.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.567
How hard can it be?

38:55.601 --> 38:57.001
(grunts)

38:57.034 --> 38:58.769
(grunts)

39:03.875 --> 39:05.811
It just got harder.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.746
I'm not leaving
till that thing's disarmed.

39:07.778 --> 39:09.313
I guess you're not leaving.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.717
(grunting)

39:14.184 --> 39:16.320
(grunting)

39:16.353 --> 39:19.224
I'm gonna carve you up
and serve you with gravy.

39:19.257 --> 39:23.894
You piss me off, boy.
Now you pay the price.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.364
First the eyes,
then the tongue.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.333
I'm gonna break every
one of your fingers.

39:28.365 --> 39:30.300
You gonna do all that
in 49 seconds?

39:40.210 --> 39:44.282
(beeping)
(panting)

39:44.315 --> 39:46.016
I know what you're thinkin'.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.418
Can I get by him?

39:47.452 --> 39:48.853
Get up the stairs,
out of the building?

39:48.887 --> 39:50.387
Seconds ticking away.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.356
I don't love your chances.

39:52.389 --> 39:54.259
Then you'll die, too.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.795
Yeah, looks like.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.563
So I guess
the question really is--

39:58.597 --> 40:00.798
who has less fear?

40:00.831 --> 40:04.536
I'm not afraid to die.
I'm already dead.

40:04.570 --> 40:07.105
Yeah, but this is different.

40:07.137 --> 40:09.306
Being blowed up
isn't walking around

40:09.340 --> 40:10.976
and drinking
with your buddies dead.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.311
It's little bits being
swept up by a janitor dead,

40:13.344 --> 40:15.213
and I don't think
you're ready for that.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.048
(beeping)

40:18.083 --> 40:21.018
(panting)

40:26.291 --> 40:28.827
Are you?

40:28.860 --> 40:32.329
(beeping)

40:32.362 --> 40:35.000
I like the quiet.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.135
(grunting, growling)

40:37.168 --> 40:42.106
GILES:
 Omnia... vasa... veritatis!

40:42.139 --> 40:43.742
Now, Buffy!

40:43.775 --> 40:46.077
(grunting)

40:46.110 --> 40:47.846
(beeping)

41:10.367 --> 41:14.706
(gasps, low whir)

41:17.842 --> 41:20.244
Good boy.

41:28.485 --> 41:30.789
I don't think I want
to be seeing you

41:30.822 --> 41:33.224
on campus anymore, Jack.

41:51.242 --> 41:53.744
I'm not going
anywhere, Harris.

41:53.778 --> 41:56.414
The first time
you turn your back...

41:56.447 --> 41:58.248
(yelling, growling)

42:03.454 --> 42:06.056
WILLOW:
 Even after the Hellmouth
 was closed,

42:06.090 --> 42:08.726
we could still
 hear it screaming.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.001
But Angel's gonna be okay?

42:16.034 --> 42:18.704
He was only out
for a few minutes.

42:18.737 --> 42:20.204
Longest of my life.

42:20.237 --> 42:22.673
I will never forget
that thing's face.

42:22.708 --> 42:25.242
Its real face, I mean.

42:25.275 --> 42:26.612
GILES:
Yes.

42:26.644 --> 42:29.947
I don't know
how you managed.

42:31.548 --> 42:34.619
It was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

42:34.652 --> 42:37.889
(laughs)
Stupidest.

42:37.922 --> 42:40.791
But the world continues to turn.

42:42.159 --> 42:44.362
WILLOW:
No one will
ever know

42:44.394 --> 42:46.264
how close it came to stopping.

42:46.297 --> 42:49.199
Never know what we did.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.402
XANDER:
Guys.

42:51.436 --> 42:52.771
OZ:
Hey.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.706
Xander. Boy,
you're lucky

42:54.739 --> 42:56.373
you weren't at school
last night.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.476
It was crazed.

42:59.677 --> 43:02.813
Well, uh,
give me the quiet life.

43:02.847 --> 43:05.315
I'm gonna grab a snack.
Anyone want?

43:05.349 --> 43:07.251
No, thank you.
Oz?

43:07.284 --> 43:10.554
No. Oddly full today.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.990
Okay.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.563
Ooh, look,
it's Mr. Excitement.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.298
On another life-or-death
doughnut mission,

43:21.331 --> 43:23.768
or are we just cruising
for bimbos again,

43:23.802 --> 43:26.204
giving them lessons
in lack of cool?

43:28.974 --> 43:30.708
What?

43:31.976 --> 43:34.112
What?

43:36.181 --> 43:38.215
What?!

44:16.021 --> 44:18.422
Grr. Argh.
