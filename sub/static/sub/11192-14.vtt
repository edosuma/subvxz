WEBVTT

00:10.199 --> 00:16.277
So, what exactly will we see after this
eclipse begins? It is black and it is a hole.

00:16.277 --> 00:19.233
Well, it might be a... black hole.

00:20.079 --> 00:24.117
- Let me put that a different way.
- No, you're right. You can't actually see it.

00:24.118 --> 00:28.077
Not the singularity itself. It's so massive,
not even light can escape it.

00:28.077 --> 00:30.478
But during the totality phase
of the eclipse,

00:30.478 --> 00:33.557
we should be able to see matter
spiralling towards it.

00:33.557 --> 00:36.345
Actually, it's called the accretion disc.

00:37.078 --> 00:43.033
I can see why the local population would
be afraid of it... What did you just say?

00:43.398 --> 00:45.390
It's just an astronomical term.

00:45.398 --> 00:50.143
Did you think the colonel had a telescope
on his roof just to look at the neighbours?

00:57.276 --> 00:59.351
Not initially.

01:23.156 --> 01:26.489
Someone from SG-7
should have been here to greet us.

01:27.115 --> 01:30.698
They should be prepping
the telescope for the big show.

01:50.713 --> 01:52.789
Oh, God!

01:53.433 --> 01:55.509
All right, MOPP 4.

02:10.312 --> 02:13.950
Daniel, you and Teal'c check the village.

02:13.951 --> 02:17.632
See why no one's missed this guy,
where everyone else is.

02:17.633 --> 02:19.709
We've got the observatory.

02:19.711 --> 02:21.953
All right, move out.

02:45.151 --> 02:47.227
<i>Where is everyone?</i>

03:03.229 --> 03:06.015
<i>- Found 'em.
- Oh my God.</i>

03:08.188 --> 03:11.308
<i>Jack! Jack!</i>

03:13.669 --> 03:16.241
They're all dead. Everyone.

04:34.745 --> 04:37.624
<i>This complex
has been decontaminated.</i>

04:37.625 --> 04:40.783
- How many dead?
- We estimate about a thousand.

04:40.784 --> 04:43.103
Why didn't they send a message?

04:43.105 --> 04:45.822
- We don't know.
- Looks like it happened very quickly.

04:45.824 --> 04:48.742
There may still be survivors.
Shouldn't we look for them?

04:48.744 --> 04:51.581
Not until I examine you.
We'll use the barracks room.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.701
Colonel, you touched one
of the victims without gloves?

04:54.702 --> 04:58.701
- Yeah, but I washed my hands right away.
- No. You are first.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.619
Allergies, right?

05:13.101 --> 05:14.975
- Right?
- Right.

05:22.182 --> 05:25.516
We're supposed to tag
the bodies we find with these.

05:26.661 --> 05:29.939
<i>- They knew this would happen.
- The indigenous people?</i>

05:29.940 --> 05:34.379
They told me three months ago that with
the darkness would come the apocalypse.

05:34.380 --> 05:36.254
It was part of their mythology.

05:36.261 --> 05:40.555
We said "It's just an eclipse
and there's nothing to worry about."

06:03.978 --> 06:05.853
Hello?

06:06.620 --> 06:09.098
It's OK, you can come out.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.096
I know I must look pretty scary
in this mask, but I'm not gonna hurt you.

06:15.540 --> 06:19.668
Colonel, there's someone in the bushes
and they won't come out.

06:21.617 --> 06:24.156
Show 'em your face.

06:24.778 --> 06:26.853
Try to look friendly.

06:45.417 --> 06:47.492
We will not hurt you.

06:48.816 --> 06:51.271
Please come out.

06:55.216 --> 06:57.293
Take my hand.

07:03.495 --> 07:05.572
It is OK.

07:20.454 --> 07:23.704
It's OK. Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

07:25.615 --> 07:27.692
Can you hear me?

07:28.894 --> 07:31.093
Very brave.

07:31.095 --> 07:34.452
- Can I take this mask off?
- I think it'd be OK.

07:34.454 --> 07:39.033
Looks like we're dealing with a bacterial
infection. Just don't get too close.

07:41.173 --> 07:43.249
There. That's better, huh?

07:43.894 --> 07:46.682
You feel like telling me your name now?

07:48.014 --> 07:50.848
That's OK. You remember my name?

07:53.334 --> 07:55.954
Samantha Carter.
But you can call me Sam.

08:02.851 --> 08:05.011
Oh, no. No, no, honey.

08:07.173 --> 08:09.627
You're not gonna die.

08:10.333 --> 08:13.583
Why don't you just lay down
and rest for a while, OK?

08:21.411 --> 08:22.740
OK.

08:25.451 --> 08:27.526
This can't be.

08:28.610 --> 08:31.250
- She's infected, isn't she?
- No, she's not.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.578
What's wrong, then?

08:32.610 --> 08:35.850
Traces of the element the Stargate
is made of are in her blood.

08:35.851 --> 08:37.475
- Naqahdah?
- Yeah.

08:37.490 --> 08:41.928
It's possible that's the reason
she was able to resist the infection.

08:41.929 --> 08:44.005
Thank you. Take a look.

08:50.409 --> 08:52.485
Well, I have some bad news.

08:52.489 --> 08:55.607
The samples show
the entire area is contaminated.

08:55.609 --> 08:57.601
It's in the water and the ground.

08:57.610 --> 09:03.067
The bacteria doesn't seem to be airborne,
but it can survive in varied environments.

09:03.288 --> 09:07.447
- Listen, I hate to sound self-centred but...
- Your tests are fine.

09:07.448 --> 09:09.648
- What of the girl?
- No sign of infection.

09:09.649 --> 09:14.407
And I did an ultrasound. She isn't
parasitically infested with a Goa'uld.

09:14.408 --> 09:15.951
So she goes back with us.

09:16.447 --> 09:19.606
Doctor, would it be safe
for someone to stay a little longer?

09:19.607 --> 09:22.407
We're safe right now, aren't we?

09:22.408 --> 09:24.317
Captain?

09:24.328 --> 09:27.006
Sir, the eclipse happens
in less than one day.

09:27.008 --> 09:31.767
This is our only opportunity to photograph
the black hole with this telescope.

09:31.768 --> 09:34.246
It could change
the course of human history.

09:34.248 --> 09:36.323
I don't want to belittle what happened,

09:36.327 --> 09:40.325
but, if we leave, SG-7 and all these people
will have died for nothing.

09:54.966 --> 09:57.207
<i>Well, you won't be staying.</i>

09:59.806 --> 10:02.926
I will remain. I am not at risk.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.956
Yeah, I'll stay too.

10:18.725 --> 10:20.801
Hey, are you OK?

10:22.125 --> 10:25.283
Don't be afraid. I'll be
holding your hand the whole way.

10:25.284 --> 10:28.866
I know it looks kinda scary,
but it's really a lot of fun.

10:37.524 --> 10:40.726
<i>On three. One, two, three!</i>

11:04.883 --> 11:09.259
<i>Level one decontamination
complete. Proceed with level two.</i>

11:09.601 --> 11:12.092
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.091
That wasn't so bad, was it?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.491
Well, here we are.

11:26.522 --> 11:29.879
This is where you're gonna stay
for a little while, OK?

11:29.879 --> 11:33.084
I know it's nothing fancy,
but we'll fix it up.

11:46.519 --> 11:51.561
I have to go somewhere for a little while,
but I promise you I won't be gone long.

11:55.119 --> 11:57.878
No, I have to go.

11:57.879 --> 12:02.625
But I'll be able to see you the whole time
through that camera up there. See?

12:12.239 --> 12:15.240
All right, I'll stay for a little while.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.716
<i>She seems
to have bonded with Captain Carter.</i>

12:34.716 --> 12:38.395
<i>No wonder she's terrified.
It was not pretty over there.</i>

12:38.398 --> 12:39.975
What happened?

12:39.996 --> 12:43.596
We counted 1,432 dead.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.716
I... believe we may be
indirectly responsible.

12:47.316 --> 12:48.264
How?

12:48.317 --> 12:51.995
Someone from Earth may have brought
a normally harmless bacteria there.

12:51.995 --> 12:54.274
It learned traits from a local organism

12:54.275 --> 12:58.274
and mutated into the most deadly
infectious strain I've ever encountered.

12:58.275 --> 13:01.553
Are you positive you haven't
brought back any of this disease?

13:01.554 --> 13:04.994
Yes, sir. In fact, I think
we may have brought back the cure.

13:04.995 --> 13:06.027
Doctor?

13:06.076 --> 13:10.394
Somehow this little girl survived
on a completely contaminated planet.

13:10.395 --> 13:13.193
I'm hoping she has
a natural immunity that we might use

13:13.195 --> 13:17.115
in fighting other serious infections
already here on Earth.

13:17.115 --> 13:21.611
Why didn't the telescope team report
that this outbreak was going on?

13:22.595 --> 13:24.671
We don't know.

13:38.273 --> 13:40.349
Don't you want this?

13:40.712 --> 13:42.788
See, uh...

13:42.793 --> 13:47.668
we usually put some stuff on it, like this.

13:49.831 --> 13:51.409
See?

13:54.633 --> 13:56.709
<i>Mmm!</i>

14:31.470 --> 14:35.883
That's me, OK?
You're not alone any more.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.426
This is fun.

14:52.788 --> 14:54.865
Only eight hours to go.

14:55.389 --> 14:57.048
Sweet.

14:57.469 --> 15:00.672
I still do not understand this black hole.

15:01.869 --> 15:06.586
Well, a black hole is
this really... big... thing.

15:06.589 --> 15:08.664
It's, um...

15:09.307 --> 15:12.427
Well, basically, it's a massive...

15:14.388 --> 15:16.463
hole...

15:16.868 --> 15:18.659
out there.

15:22.626 --> 15:24.086
I see.

15:24.746 --> 15:29.740
And what happens is,
everything gets sucked into it.

15:30.508 --> 15:32.584
Even light.

15:32.586 --> 15:35.077
That's why we can't see it.

15:36.147 --> 15:38.222
It just gets...

15:39.947 --> 15:41.405
sucked in.

15:43.385 --> 15:45.046
Thank you.

15:47.466 --> 15:48.924
Sure.

16:06.384 --> 16:07.842
Hey.

16:08.823 --> 16:10.899
How are you feeling?

16:12.225 --> 16:15.302
Listen, I have to go somewhere
for a little while.

16:15.303 --> 16:19.023
But you're not gonna be alone.
Daniel will be here the whole time.

16:19.024 --> 16:21.515
Remember Daniel?

16:26.184 --> 16:27.927
You're very brave, remember?

16:29.463 --> 16:31.503
I'll be back before you know it.

16:34.462 --> 16:36.123
Please don't go.

16:43.344 --> 16:45.917
You feel like telling me your name?

16:46.783 --> 16:48.692
Cassandra.

16:48.982 --> 16:50.855
Hi, Cassandra.

16:51.501 --> 16:53.709
I hurt.

16:54.942 --> 16:57.018
Where?

17:01.660 --> 17:03.903
Sounds good. No fluid in her lungs.

17:04.381 --> 17:07.631
She described it more like
a sharp, stabbing pain.

17:16.700 --> 17:21.180
Her latest blood work shows
a marked potassium deficiency.

17:21.181 --> 17:26.259
I have no idea what is causing it,
but one of the effects can be arrhythmia.

17:26.259 --> 17:31.681
- You're sure she hasn't got the disease?
- Positive. This is not a bacterial infection.

17:34.980 --> 17:37.056
OK. Thank you.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.505
All right. Let's go back to our room.

17:43.338 --> 17:45.414
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

17:47.699 --> 17:49.608
What? What?

17:49.618 --> 17:52.240
- What is it?
- Get her on the table.

17:57.459 --> 18:00.577
- What is it?
- An irregular heartbeat. She's in arrest.

18:00.578 --> 18:03.116
- Code blue in the lab!
- What? What do I do?

18:09.656 --> 18:15.280
Cardiac arrest! Potassium deficiency!
Get me a No. 7 cuffed endotracheal tube!

18:30.416 --> 18:32.816
Tube's ready.

18:32.817 --> 18:36.352
- Tube's in.
- Defib. Stop CPR. Defib, 60 joules.

18:36.536 --> 18:38.612
Come on, baby, come on.

18:39.656 --> 18:40.818
Clear!

18:44.855 --> 18:46.932
Let me in, let me in.

18:48.976 --> 18:53.471
I want you to notify the ICU. I want
her potassium levels rechecked, stat.

18:54.096 --> 18:56.375
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.451
Oh my God.

18:58.453 --> 19:01.374
- What is it?
- Get me a chest x-ray, stat.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.451
I don't know. Listen.

19:08.493 --> 19:10.569
Oh my God.

19:25.933 --> 19:28.251
- What is it?
- I don't know,

19:28.252 --> 19:30.412
but it wasn't there ten hours ago.

19:44.813 --> 19:47.055
<i>I'm inserting the scope.</i>

19:47.613 --> 19:49.689
Image up.

19:51.731 --> 19:55.894
<i>- Pulse normal.
- I'm advancing the scope.</i>

20:07.132 --> 20:09.208
Pulse is rising.

20:12.490 --> 20:14.567
<i>Adjusting view.</i>

20:18.089 --> 20:20.769
Well, parts of it are definitely organic.

20:20.769 --> 20:24.387
<i>I'm gonna move in closer
and try to get a biopsy.</i>

20:25.569 --> 20:28.026
Pulse is now 140.

20:32.528 --> 20:35.897
<i>I'm scraping
the harder surfaces for samples.</i>

20:37.249 --> 20:40.832
- We have to stop!
- Just a little more.

20:43.249 --> 20:46.202
Removing scope! Prepare the paddles!

20:51.648 --> 20:53.107
Charging!

20:54.568 --> 20:56.111
Clear!

20:56.127 --> 20:58.086
Wait! Pulse is normal.

21:06.166 --> 21:09.606
This object has the ability
to stop her heart in an instant.

21:09.607 --> 21:12.406
- Can you remove it?
- Not without killing her.

21:12.407 --> 21:17.726
Dr. Warner got some samples. I'm hoping
the analysis will tell us what this object is.

21:17.728 --> 21:19.804
Thank you, Doctor.

21:22.567 --> 21:24.808
- Mom?
- Hey.

21:27.126 --> 21:29.202
You OK?

21:30.366 --> 21:32.442
I was dreaming about my mom.

21:38.807 --> 21:41.298
You miss your mom very much?

21:44.526 --> 21:48.570
- I'm tired.
- Well, then, you should get some rest.

21:50.484 --> 21:53.483
Don't worry. Everything's
gonna be just fine.

21:53.484 --> 21:55.804
And when you get better, I promise you

21:55.805 --> 21:59.962
I am gonna show you all kinds of
wonderful things about this planet.

21:59.963 --> 22:02.039
- Promise?
- You bet.

22:20.443 --> 22:22.769
- How is she?
- She's fine. Sleeping.

22:24.002 --> 22:27.442
If you want, I can sit with her
tomorrow for a few hours.

22:27.443 --> 22:29.934
- No. We're OK.
- OK.

22:31.042 --> 22:33.118
I just...

22:34.162 --> 22:36.761
- I want to do this.
- OK.

22:36.762 --> 22:40.973
But I guess what I'm saying is that
you don't have to do this alone.

22:41.362 --> 22:43.438
Thanks.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.157
It's showtime.

22:59.882 --> 23:02.171
<i>The systems are online.</i>

23:14.799 --> 23:18.086
- The eclipse has reached its totality.
- Whoa.

23:22.720 --> 23:26.078
The fatty tissue between
the two sides of the object is decaying.

23:26.079 --> 23:28.238
Very slowly, mind you, but still...

23:28.240 --> 23:29.817
What's the significance?

23:29.838 --> 23:32.238
I'm about to do an experiment to find out.

23:32.239 --> 23:36.157
One side of the object is made up
of a combination of iron and potassium,

23:36.159 --> 23:38.837
the other side of
the element in the Stargate.

23:38.838 --> 23:39.917
What?

23:39.960 --> 23:43.998
I assume it's the naqahdah in her blood.
Somehow the object is collecting it.

23:43.999 --> 23:47.718
Potassium can be one of the most volatile
alkali metals on Earth.

23:47.719 --> 23:50.478
Combined with even a small
amount of naqahdah...

23:50.479 --> 23:52.435
That doesn't sound very good.

23:52.439 --> 23:58.356
The room you see is in the subbasement
floor of this complex. It's lead-sealed.

23:58.357 --> 24:01.675
Let's see what happens
when we put the two objects together.

24:01.676 --> 24:06.385
- Where are the samples?
- I'm only using microscopic particles.

24:13.797 --> 24:16.557
The reading's off the scale for radiation.

24:16.557 --> 24:20.515
- Are we safe?
- Yeah. But we have a big problem.

24:20.516 --> 24:23.154
If two microscopic particles caused that...

24:23.155 --> 24:29.028
The object inside Cassandra could cause
a nuclear reaction a million times bigger.

24:49.595 --> 24:52.552
- What is that?
- A star, perhaps.

24:52.554 --> 24:54.346
Hit the zoom.

24:58.674 --> 25:01.461
Nah, that's way too close
to be a star. Pull back.

25:08.114 --> 25:09.904
What the hell is that?

25:12.233 --> 25:14.440
It is a Goa'uld attack vessel.

25:17.314 --> 25:20.031
<i>It's a setup. It has to be.</i>

25:20.034 --> 25:24.432
The Goa'ulds wiped out every last living
person on that planet except Cassandra,

25:24.433 --> 25:26.592
then made us think that it was our fault.

25:26.594 --> 25:31.230
They knew we wouldn't leave her there.
They knew we would bring her back here.

25:31.231 --> 25:34.592
They used their technology
to put that thing inside of her.

25:34.593 --> 25:38.671
They had us help them create the device
after she came through the Stargate

25:38.672 --> 25:40.950
so we didn't detect it
until it was too late.

25:40.951 --> 25:42.611
We gave her iron supplements.

25:42.632 --> 25:46.551
We may have turned the device on
with electricity when we resuscitated her.

25:46.552 --> 25:49.351
<i>- So it's meant to destroy us.
- Or this complex.</i>

25:49.352 --> 25:53.979
- The threat to the Goa'uld's the Stargate.
- They used that girl like a Trojan Horse.

25:54.671 --> 25:58.372
- How long do we have?
- One hour and 52 minutes.

25:58.911 --> 26:01.470
You can predict it that accurately?

26:01.471 --> 26:07.307
The cellular decay of the tissue samples
appears to be happening like clockwork.

26:33.710 --> 26:35.786
How could they do this?

26:37.269 --> 26:40.804
Well, to a Goa'uld,
she's not as we see her.

26:41.509 --> 26:46.005
She's a tool. Her death
is a very cheap way to get rid of us.

26:46.989 --> 26:49.657
I know I'm supposed to be detached...

26:51.346 --> 26:53.423
Who said that?

26:55.146 --> 26:57.769
Sometimes I forget you're not military.

26:59.948 --> 27:04.443
It is the ship of the Goa'uld Nirrti,
an enemy of Apophis.

27:08.467 --> 27:10.542
Now, what the hell is that?

27:10.547 --> 27:12.255
We must go.

27:16.705 --> 27:19.789
Look, sir, I know
this decision isn't easy for you.

27:20.346 --> 27:25.009
In fact, the decision is quite easy.
The consequences are what's difficult.

27:25.306 --> 27:27.664
There has to be another way.

27:27.665 --> 27:30.545
I've been assured
there's absolutely no way

27:30.546 --> 27:33.785
to remove the object from the girl
without killing her.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.384
Therefore we have no choice.

27:36.385 --> 27:39.863
Going by Dr. Fraiser's measurements
of the device's atomic decay,

27:39.864 --> 27:42.355
we have one hour and 20 minutes left.

27:43.664 --> 27:46.742
The girl should be prepared
to go back through the Stargate.

27:46.744 --> 27:48.738
- I'll take her, sir.
- And SG-4.

27:48.746 --> 27:51.829
I want O'Neill and Teal'c
to return with you.

28:10.624 --> 28:12.913
We must get to the Stargate!

28:13.864 --> 28:15.738
No argument from me!

28:15.743 --> 28:19.303
This Goa'uld Nirrti,
he once sent an emissary of peace

28:19.304 --> 28:23.340
to negotiate a treaty concerning
a Stargate Apophis had taken control of.

28:23.342 --> 28:27.470
The negotiation was a ploy.
The Stargate was destroyed.

28:29.382 --> 28:30.626
How?

28:30.662 --> 28:34.741
As soon as he entered the Stargate,
there was a massive explosion.

28:39.142 --> 28:41.513
The girl?

29:03.540 --> 29:05.616
Chevron three encoded.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.988
- Chevron four encoded.
- Cassandra?

29:22.740 --> 29:25.018
Take your time. No hurry.

29:25.019 --> 29:28.419
<i>- Chevron five encoded.
- What is it?</i>

29:28.420 --> 29:31.171
- She's slipped into a coma.
- What?!

29:32.140 --> 29:34.417
<i>Chevron six en...</i>

29:34.419 --> 29:36.494
What the hell...?

29:38.218 --> 29:41.468
- Close the iris.
- We're getting an SG-1 remote signal.

29:57.737 --> 29:59.813
Get the girl away from the gate!

30:01.737 --> 30:06.655
So the Goa'ulds kept SG-7 from coming
back to warn us. All part of the plan.

30:06.656 --> 30:08.732
So what are we going to do now?

30:10.257 --> 30:15.056
Teal'c, Dr. Fraiser says this device
inside the girl is on some sort of timer.

30:15.057 --> 30:18.336
You're sure it will go off
if we send her through the Stargate?

30:18.336 --> 30:22.815
We should not attempt it. The Earth gate
is what the Goa'uld wants to destroy.

30:22.816 --> 30:25.694
Cassandra deteriorated
when she got near the Stargate.

30:25.695 --> 30:30.294
I can't risk the security of this mountain.
We'll have to take her somewhere else.

30:30.295 --> 30:35.919
- What about the disused nuclear facility...
- Right. It's just 20 minutes from here.

30:38.974 --> 30:43.054
This is Major General Hammond. Get me
the Secretary of Defense immediately.

30:43.055 --> 30:46.009
It's a matter of life and death.

31:37.172 --> 31:41.465
- I can take her from here now, Captain.
- No, sir, it's OK.

31:46.849 --> 31:49.730
This elevator goes down 30 floors
through solid rock.

31:49.731 --> 31:54.940
Takes three minutes to get to the bottom.
You have four minutes to start back up.

32:21.130 --> 32:23.205
Where are we going?

32:25.729 --> 32:28.267
Please, go back to sleep.

32:29.249 --> 32:31.621
I'm not tired any more.

32:41.567 --> 32:44.272
Are you crying?

33:30.885 --> 33:33.292
Sit down here and rest for a while, OK?

33:41.845 --> 33:43.552
I have to go.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.691
You promised
you'd never leave me alone.

33:52.285 --> 33:54.076
I'll come back, OK?

33:54.804 --> 33:56.926
I'll be back.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.286
You're very brave, remember?

34:04.084 --> 34:06.575
I'm very brave.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.704
I have to close the door.

34:31.681 --> 34:33.340
Sam?

34:36.601 --> 34:38.260
Sam?

35:25.559 --> 35:27.797
Jack, she's going back down.

35:27.798 --> 35:29.875
The hell she is.

35:30.918 --> 35:32.496
Captain Carter?

35:38.119 --> 35:39.233
Captain Carter.

35:40.838 --> 35:42.914
<i>Sam, do you read me?</i>

35:44.038 --> 35:45.496
Colonel, I'm staying.

35:46.956 --> 35:49.916
<i>- Negative.
- Colonel, she's awake.</i>

35:49.918 --> 35:51.541
Oh, God.

35:55.838 --> 35:57.380
<i>Captain Carter?</i>

35:57.396 --> 36:01.228
I'm ordering you
to get back up here right now.

36:04.277 --> 36:06.353
<i>Right now!</i>

36:08.476 --> 36:12.639
<i>- Are we going to die?
- No. We are not gonna die.</i>

36:19.795 --> 36:22.251
All right, why don't you guys clear out?

36:30.434 --> 36:32.094
Right.

36:36.594 --> 36:38.670
We're both very brave.

36:39.554 --> 36:42.554
- I love you.
- I love you too.

36:53.193 --> 36:55.436
All right. Here we go.

37:21.871 --> 37:25.621
- I don't feel anything.
- We could've been wrong about the time.

37:26.072 --> 37:29.190
We could've been wrong
about what would happen.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.869
Captain Carter?

37:33.873 --> 37:35.949
Can you hear me?

37:39.271 --> 37:41.844
Sam, can you hear me?

37:45.391 --> 37:47.590
We're OK.

37:47.590 --> 37:51.208
<i>Nothing happened.
Cassandra's fine. I'm fine.</i>

37:51.789 --> 37:53.498
<i>It didn't happen.</i>

37:53.789 --> 37:57.242
I just... I couldn't leave her, sir.

38:00.590 --> 38:03.425
How did you know, Captain?

38:04.389 --> 38:08.668
She first slipped into the coma when
we brought her close to the Stargate.

38:08.670 --> 38:12.108
As soon as we got her far enough away
from the Stargate, she woke up.

38:12.108 --> 38:14.184
<i>And I... knew.</i>

38:15.708 --> 38:17.500
You knew?

38:37.507 --> 38:40.045
You're gettin' a little heavy for this.

38:41.507 --> 38:42.751
Cassandra!

38:43.865 --> 38:45.942
Hey, there he is.

38:52.507 --> 38:56.552
- What's that?
- We have a rule here on Earth.

38:58.585 --> 39:01.346
Every kid has got to have a dog.

39:01.347 --> 39:03.505
This is a dog.

39:04.226 --> 39:07.061
And he's yours.

39:17.226 --> 39:19.349
So, how sure were you, really?

39:20.505 --> 39:23.293
I can't explain it, Daniel. I just knew.

39:24.184 --> 39:26.806
A mother's instinct, perhaps.

39:27.503 --> 39:29.579
Subtle, but no.

39:29.583 --> 39:33.184
Dr. Fraiser's gonna take her
until we can find qualified parents.

39:33.184 --> 39:37.342
By "qualified" you mean
ones with the right security clearance.

39:37.344 --> 39:41.222
I wouldn't be surprised if Dr. Fraiser
wants to keep her for herself.

39:41.224 --> 39:43.382
As long as Cassandra's happy.

39:43.384 --> 39:45.507
<i>She appears to be.</i>

39:46.063 --> 39:48.943
I wasn't at ease until I knew
the object was shrinking

39:48.943 --> 39:51.101
and being reabsorbed into her system.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.340
Hey!

39:54.782 --> 39:57.487
Hey, Samantha. See my new dog?

39:58.222 --> 40:00.891
<i>Wow! Your new dog?</i>

40:01.302 --> 40:05.431
It's an Earth rule: every kid
has to have one. But I don't mind.

40:10.981 --> 40:13.603
Why don't I take the dog for a little walk?

40:15.702 --> 40:17.693
Come here.

40:17.702 --> 40:20.407
Teal'c? You know anything about dogs?

40:20.900 --> 40:22.146
Nothing.

40:27.302 --> 40:30.501
When you find me a new home,
will you come and visit me?

40:30.501 --> 40:33.501
You betcha. All the time.

40:33.501 --> 40:36.579
- That is, when you're on Earth.
- Right.

40:36.581 --> 40:38.860
- Now, about that, Cassandra.
- I know.

40:38.860 --> 40:41.420
The Stargate is a secret,

40:41.420 --> 40:44.871
and I was born in a place called...

40:45.019 --> 40:47.262
- Toronto?
- Right.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.657
What are those?

40:52.579 --> 40:56.161
Ah. Those are swings.

40:56.739 --> 41:00.108
We never had any of those... in Toronto.

41:01.099 --> 41:04.634
- They look like fun.
- They are. Come on.
