I need you to give me
an honest answer.

34:18.990 --> 34:20.392
Of course.

34:20.526 --> 34:24.062
Did you want Elizabeth
to see you shoot her mother?

34:24.196 --> 34:25.431
Knowing that if she did,

34:25.564 --> 34:28.400

to her old life.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.838
Why would I ever do that?

34:32.971 --> 34:34.673
Because you live
in that dark place.

34:36.875 --> 34:40.512
And she can't take over
your empire without
living there, too.

34:40.646 --> 34:44.516

someone they love,

want her arrested, either.

I wanted her arrested.
