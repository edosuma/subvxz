Elmo's so excited.

01:29.233 --> 01:31.567
It's Elmo's
favorite time of year!

01:31.567 --> 01:33.066
- Louie: Mm-hmm.
- Me, too!

01:33.066 --> 01:34.333
Me, three!

01:34.333 --> 01:36.934
That's three,
three excited children!

01:36.934 --> 01:38.266
Ah ah ah!

01:38.266 --> 01:40.500
( organ playing,
thunder )

01:40.500 --> 01:42.900
Eh, Christmas
is the worst.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.433
All this cheerfulness
and gift giving.

01:45.433 --> 01:46.867
Blech!

01:46.867 --> 01:50.266
Well, Oscar,
what do grouches
celebrate?

01:50.266 --> 01:54.533
For your information,
we grouches celebrate
Crankymas.

01:54.533 --> 01:58.433
It's when you invite
your family over to argue
and give each other junk.

01:58.433 --> 01:59.967
Oh, how festive.

01:59.967 --> 02:02.433
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I just got a heavy,

02:02.433 --> 02:05.367
disgusting,
sticky fruitcake
for Crankymas,

02:05.367 --> 02:07.033
and I can't wait.

02:07.033 --> 02:09.300
Heh heh heh.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.333
Yuck.

02:11.333 --> 02:16.033
Well, lots of people like
to celebrate different
things this season.

02:16.033 --> 02:18.233
That's true.
At my house,
we also celebrate

02:18.233 --> 02:20.400
El Día Los Reyes,
Three Kings Day.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.133
¡Oh, yo también,
yo también!

02:22.133 --> 02:25.066
And we eat king's cake,
el rosca de reyes.

02:25.066 --> 02:27.066
- It's so much fun!
- Elmo: Wow!

02:27.066 --> 02:29.567
Yeah, and there's also
Hanukkah and Kwanzaa.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.433
There are so many ways
people celebrate the season.

02:32.433 --> 02:35.800
Yeah, me so excited to see
what Santa going to
bring this year!

02:35.800 --> 02:37.800
Me ask for something
very special!

02:37.800 --> 02:40.033
Ooh! Let me guess--
cookies!

02:42.300 --> 02:44.333
- Hey, guys.
- Merry Christmas, everybody!

02:44.333 --> 02:45.867
All:
Merry Christmas!

02:45.867 --> 02:47.367
Say, Bert and I are
throwing a Christmas party,

02:47.367 --> 02:49.200
and you're all invited!

02:49.200 --> 02:52.333
- I've got the yule log video!

02:52.333 --> 02:54.934
- Rosita: Hmm.
- Hmm.

02:54.934 --> 02:56.533
It's the director's cut.

02:56.533 --> 02:58.600
All: Uh...

02:58.600 --> 03:01.934
Uh, we're-- we're also
singing carols!

03:01.934 --> 03:04.166
- Nina: Oh, sure. I'll come!
- Alan: Sounds like fun!

03:04.166 --> 03:05.367
Yeah!

03:05.367 --> 03:07.033
Well, we'd love to,

03:07.033 --> 03:09.333
but I think it's time
to head off to bed.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.834
Oh, yeah!

03:10.834 --> 03:13.667
Elmo almost forgot
to leave out cookies
for Santa.

03:13.667 --> 03:16.066
Cookies?
Did someone say cookies?

03:16.066 --> 03:17.433
- Heh heh heh.
- Ha ha ha!

03:17.433 --> 03:18.867
Good night,
everyone.

03:18.867 --> 03:21.066
Good night!
Merry Christmas!

03:21.066 --> 03:22.734
Hey, hey, Abby.
Check this out.

03:22.734 --> 03:24.934
Check this out.
This is the really
cool part right here.

03:24.934 --> 03:27.100
- Oh, Bert.
- Bert: You got to
watch closely.

03:27.100 --> 03:30.200
Oh, come on, Elmo.
It's beddy-bye time.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.567
Elmo:
Oh, wait, Daddy!
Elmo forgot something.

03:32.567 --> 03:34.433
Ha ha ha!

03:34.433 --> 03:37.367
Boy, Elmo almost forgot
to leave cookies out
for Santa.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.467
Oh, oh, oh.
Good thinking, son.

03:39.467 --> 03:43.367
Ha ha ha! Oh, boy!
Elmo's so excited
for Christmas.

03:43.367 --> 03:47.066
Elmo's gonna put
these cookies right here
where Santa can see them!

03:47.066 --> 03:49.600
Okay.
Now climb on up in here.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.967
Oh, okay.

03:50.967 --> 03:54.667
Time to get all
snug as a bug in a rug.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.767
Yeah!
Ha ha ha!

03:56.767 --> 03:58.600
- Heh heh heh!
- Ahh.

04:00.066 --> 04:01.600
Ahh. Ahem.

04:05.900 --> 04:10.400
Oh. Daddy, well, why do we
leave cookies for Santa?

04:10.400 --> 04:16.767
- Uh, why do we leave
cookies out for Santa?
- For Santa!

04:16.767 --> 04:21.967
Well, Elmo, that is
a very good question there,

04:21.967 --> 04:26.633
and, uh,
I've got a bedtime story
that will answer it.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.767
- Oh, yeah!

04:28.767 --> 04:31.467
Elmo loves Daddy's
bedtime stories.

04:31.467 --> 04:33.800
Ha ha!
Well, uh, ahem.

04:33.800 --> 04:39.266
Uh, it all started
once upon a time on
Christmas Eve...

04:39.266 --> 04:42.133
- Oh!
- ...long, long ago.

04:42.133 --> 04:47.166
Uh, back then,
uh, Sesame Street was
a very different place.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.333
Oh, well,
different how?

04:49.333 --> 04:51.300
Well, uh, oh,
for one thing,

04:51.300 --> 04:54.333
it didn't look anything
like it does today.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.533
Louie:
It looked very different.

05:03.533 --> 05:08.200
There were no cars
or electric lights,

05:08.200 --> 05:10.567
and the people
were different, too,

05:10.567 --> 05:16.200
all except for
a few great-great relatives
of some people you know.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.567
Hello, everybody!

05:18.567 --> 05:23.033
It is I, your fuzzy
and adorable 19th-century
traveling salesmonster.

05:23.033 --> 05:26.133
Could someone please
tell me how to get
to Sesame Street?

05:26.133 --> 05:29.300
Oh. Hello. Can you tell me
how to get-- uh, yeah--

05:29.300 --> 05:33.166
how to get to
Sesame Street?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.667
Anyone?

05:35.667 --> 05:36.867
- You're here.

05:36.867 --> 05:38.433
This is
Sesame Street.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.633
Oh, thank you.
You know, it is so strange.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.700
No one else here
would even speak to me.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.133
Well, that's because
I'm the nicest guy in town.

05:47.133 --> 05:48.400
- Yep.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.166
Now take your stuff
and scram!

05:52.166 --> 05:54.400
- Elmo: Wait a minute!

05:54.400 --> 05:57.867
Oscar was the nicest
person on Sesame Street?

05:57.867 --> 06:00.233
Oh. You're talking about
Oscar the Grouch, right?

06:00.233 --> 06:06.066
Remember, this was
a long, long time ago
on Sesame Street,

06:06.066 --> 06:09.367
so it was actually
Oscar's great, uh--

06:09.367 --> 06:15.066
great-grand grouch
Oscar the Malcontent,

06:15.066 --> 06:18.533
but-- but, yes,
he was the nicest person.

06:18.533 --> 06:21.900
Mm, yeah,
that doesn't make
any sense to Elmo.

06:21.900 --> 06:25.100
Well, I did say things
were different back then.

06:25.100 --> 06:30.467
You see, even though
on the outside the people
might have looked the same,

06:30.467 --> 06:36.367
on the inside,
they were very different
than they are today.

06:36.367 --> 06:38.433
Hello, first
customer of the day,

06:38.433 --> 06:41.033
and what a lovely day it is,
don't you think?

06:41.033 --> 06:43.400
- I have a very special
item to offer you.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.533
It is this handy,
dandy welcome mat,

06:45.533 --> 06:47.900
a wonderful addition
to any home.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.633
What would I want
with one of those?

06:50.633 --> 06:53.567
Uh, to put on
your doorstep of course.

06:53.567 --> 06:55.767
- Well, to be friendly

06:55.767 --> 06:58.300
and invite people
to enjoy the comforts
of your lovely home.

06:58.300 --> 07:01.467
That way,
all of your neighbors
will know that they are...

07:01.467 --> 07:04.100
- Ugh!

07:04.100 --> 07:05.400
Heh heh heh.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.033
Listen.
Don't take it
personal, pal.

07:08.033 --> 07:11.333
You see, that's just
the way people are
on our street.

07:11.333 --> 07:12.767
What? They don't like
welcome mats?

07:12.767 --> 07:15.500
No. This is
Sesame Street,

07:15.500 --> 07:19.066
the unfriendliest
street in town!

07:19.066 --> 07:21.967
- Elmo: Hang on, hang on.

07:21.967 --> 07:24.967
The unfriendliest
street in town?!

07:24.967 --> 07:26.767
Sesame Street?!

07:26.767 --> 07:28.667
Well, as I said...

07:28.667 --> 07:31.200
Both:
Things were
different then.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.333
- Right.
- Yeah.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.533
But wait a minute,
Daddy.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.934
Last week when you
told Elmo a story,

07:36.934 --> 07:41.266
you said that
everybody on Sesame Street
were happy circus clowns.

07:41.266 --> 07:44.166
Well, uh,
you are right, Elmo,

07:44.166 --> 07:46.934
but this is
a different story.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.834
Aha!
So it is just a story.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.333
Oh, so pretend!

07:51.333 --> 07:54.667
People weren't really
unfriendly on Sesame Street.

07:54.667 --> 07:59.367
Well, you know, Elmo,
even though a story
is pretend,

07:59.367 --> 08:01.934
you can still
learn something from it.

08:01.934 --> 08:04.066
You just have to
listen closely.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.934
Oh, okay.
Elmo will listen closely.

08:06.934 --> 08:09.867
Okay.
Now, where was I?

08:09.867 --> 08:11.200
Oh, right, right.
Ahem.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.300
Uh, Grover's great-great
grandmonster said...

08:15.300 --> 08:16.867
What? They don't like
welcome mats?

08:16.867 --> 08:20.033
No. This is
Sesame Street,

08:20.033 --> 08:22.500
the unfriendliest
street in town!

08:22.500 --> 08:24.734
Oh, I do not think
that could be true.

08:24.734 --> 08:26.633
I live only a few
short blocks from here,

08:26.633 --> 08:28.667
and everyone there
is very kind.

08:28.667 --> 08:29.934
That may be so,

08:29.934 --> 08:34.100
but if you want
a warm welcome or
a nice howdy-doo,

08:34.100 --> 08:36.667
then Sesame Street
isn't for you.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.367
Hey. You know what?
That rhymes.

08:39.367 --> 08:41.166
- It's not intentional!
- Oh, sorry.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.934
You see, here,
the crabs are extra crabby.

08:43.934 --> 08:47.734
Hey!
Get off of my beach!

08:47.734 --> 08:50.166
The cows are
super bossy.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.433
Mooove!

08:52.433 --> 08:55.200
Oh, I'm sorry to-- ow!

08:55.200 --> 08:57.333
Not even those guys
get along.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.767
Wow!
You are right, sir.

09:07.767 --> 09:10.133
This is one
unfriendly street.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.367
- I told you.
- But...

09:11.367 --> 09:13.100
Hark!

09:13.100 --> 09:15.900
- What is that delicious
smell I am smelling?

09:15.900 --> 09:19.533
Well, we do have
one of the finest
cookie shops in the world.

09:19.533 --> 09:21.533
Ahh. Cookies!

09:23.633 --> 09:26.066
- Good luck, pal!
- Thank you, sir!

09:26.066 --> 09:29.300
I was being sarcastic.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.000
♪ Dum, dee, dum ♪

09:31.000 --> 09:32.834
♪ Dum, dee, dum,
dee, dum. ♪

09:32.834 --> 09:34.066
Ahh.

09:34.066 --> 09:36.433
Ah. Hello there!

09:36.433 --> 09:39.867
Wow! Those cookies
smell delicious.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.600
Oh, thank you very much.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.734
Uh, they me Nana Monster's
special recipe--

09:44.734 --> 09:46.667
chocolate chippies.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.066
Yeah. Look.

09:48.066 --> 09:51.600
Me also make
double chocolate chippies.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.000
My goodness!

09:54.000 --> 09:55.600
My mouth
is watering already.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.834
- But that's not all!

09:57.834 --> 10:01.767
Me also have
triple chocolate chippies.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.934
Oh.

10:03.967 --> 10:08.033
Oh, my, my,
my goodness!

10:08.033 --> 10:09.967
How does a monster
ever decide?

10:09.967 --> 10:11.934
Hmm.

10:11.934 --> 10:15.767
Ahh.
I will take one each
of your Nana Monster's

10:15.767 --> 10:18.433
yummy chocolate chip
cookies, please.

10:18.433 --> 10:20.600
Uh, no.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.834
But you will not
sell me the cookies?

10:22.834 --> 10:25.600
Of course not.
Cookies for me!

10:25.600 --> 10:28.300
Ahh nom nom nom! Ahh!

10:28.300 --> 10:31.934
- But--
- Oh, yum, oh, yum, yum.

10:31.934 --> 10:33.333
Nom nom nom!

10:33.333 --> 10:35.433
Excuse me.

10:35.433 --> 10:39.867
- Elmo: Wow! Sesame Street
sure was a strange place.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.734
You can
say that again.

10:41.734 --> 10:44.333
Cookie Monster
not sharing his cookies?

10:44.333 --> 10:47.133
Boy, they all seem
so unfriendly.

10:47.133 --> 10:49.500
Why wasn't anybody
nice, Daddy?

10:49.500 --> 10:53.133
Well, it's never
just one reason.

10:53.133 --> 10:55.834
In the end,
I guess you could say

10:55.834 --> 11:00.200
that people just
weren't kind to each other,

11:00.200 --> 11:02.767
and since there was
no kindness,

11:02.767 --> 11:07.367
there was no celebrating
holidays on Sesame Street.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.533
No celebrating
holidays?

11:09.533 --> 11:13.967
Mm-mm.
No Hanukkah, no Kwanzaa,

11:13.967 --> 11:16.400
and no Christmas.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.467
Wha!

11:19.467 --> 11:21.567
And no Santa.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.400
Wait a minute.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.266
- Santa didn't come
to Sesame Street?
- Yeah, that's right.

11:27.266 --> 11:32.166
Santa only visits places
where people are friendly,
but back then...

11:32.166 --> 11:34.133
There's one place
we don't need to stop.

11:35.967 --> 11:40.367
Louie:
All of Sesame Street
was on Santa's naughty list.

11:40.367 --> 11:44.400
So, Santa never visited
Sesame Street?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.800
Mm-mm.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.967
So, of course,
no one left out any
Christmas cookies either.

11:49.967 --> 11:53.400
Well, Elmo knows
it's just a story,

11:53.400 --> 11:56.867
but, well, Santa comes
to Sesame Street now.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.500
Oh, and everybody here
is kind,

11:59.500 --> 12:03.734
so-- so how did
Sesame Street change?

12:03.734 --> 12:06.233
Well,
like a lot of things,

12:06.233 --> 12:10.133
the change started
because of one person.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.400
Oh, who?

12:11.400 --> 12:15.266
Your great-great
grandmonster Elmo.

12:15.266 --> 12:19.333
Oh! Oh, the one that
Elmo's named after?

12:19.333 --> 12:20.567
Ha ha!
That's right!

12:20.567 --> 12:22.600
He was
a lot like you.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.467
- Ha ha ha!
- Heh heh heh!

12:24.467 --> 12:26.633
And when he moved
to Sesame Street...

12:26.633 --> 12:29.567
- ...he was just
a little monster, too.

12:29.567 --> 12:31.000
Whoa, oh, oh!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.133
Look at
all the buildings.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.834
Ohh!

12:34.834 --> 12:36.367
Ha ha!

12:36.367 --> 12:37.567
There it is.

12:37.567 --> 12:42.500
That's the address--
123 Sesame Street,

12:42.500 --> 12:44.066
our new home.

12:44.066 --> 12:46.000
- Oh, oh, oh!

12:46.000 --> 12:48.700
Oh, boy!
Elmo's gonna love it here.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.166
- Oh, but, Daddy.

12:51.166 --> 12:54.433
Well, where are all
the Christmas decorations?

12:54.433 --> 12:56.600
Huh.
You're right.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.867
There aren't any.

12:57.867 --> 13:00.567
Well, maybe--
maybe on Sesame Street

13:00.567 --> 13:03.600
everybody only hangs them
on the inside of their houses.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.266
Ha ha!
Maybe they do.
Tell you what.

13:06.266 --> 13:08.867
While I start unpacking,
why don't you have
a look around,

13:08.867 --> 13:09.934
see if you can make
some new friends?

13:09.934 --> 13:12.633
- Oh, okay, Daddy.
- All right.

13:12.633 --> 13:14.867
♪ Do do do. ♪
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

13:14.867 --> 13:16.000
Merry Christmas!

13:16.000 --> 13:17.500
Don't talk to him.
Let's go.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.834
Huh?

13:18.834 --> 13:20.800
Boy, maybe they
were in a hurry.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.800
Oh, Merry Christmas,
Officer.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.834
Oh! Stop talking nonsense
and keep moving, son,

13:26.834 --> 13:29.633
and try not
to be so cheery.

13:29.633 --> 13:31.567
Wha?

13:31.567 --> 13:33.867
"Merry Christmas."
Kids these days!

13:35.834 --> 13:37.400
That's weird.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.700
It was just here.

13:38.700 --> 13:39.800
- Whoa!
- Hey!

13:41.100 --> 13:43.133
Hi. Merry Christmas!

13:43.133 --> 13:44.533
Merry whos

13:44.533 --> 13:46.133
Boy, what is it
with this street?

13:46.133 --> 13:47.967
Hasn't anybody
heard of Christmas?

13:47.967 --> 13:50.300
Wait. Who's--
who's Christmas?

13:50.300 --> 13:51.767
Christmas
isn't a person.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.700
It's-- it's
when Santa comes!

13:53.700 --> 13:55.500
Who?

13:55.500 --> 13:58.066
Santa?
You know Santa Claus?

13:58.066 --> 13:59.934
He-- he wears
a big, red suit

13:59.934 --> 14:01.533
and comes down
your chimney.

14:01.533 --> 14:05.233
Ah, yeah a sneak thief.
We got those.

14:05.233 --> 14:06.767
They come in,
take your stuff.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.000
No! No.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.200
Santa doesn't
take things, silly.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.900
Oh. He gives presents
to everybody who's kind.

14:13.900 --> 14:16.367
Ah. Well, no wonder
I never heard of him.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.233
No one's kind
around this street.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.934
So, uh, see you.

14:19.934 --> 14:21.100
Wait a minute,
wait a minute!

14:21.100 --> 14:22.500
You've found
Elmo's ball!

14:22.500 --> 14:24.767
Hey, hey!
Well, who's Elmo?

14:24.767 --> 14:26.066
Elmo's Elmo.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.200
Okay, this is
a little confusing,

14:28.200 --> 14:30.000
and anyway,
I think you're
a little mixed up

14:30.000 --> 14:32.433
because, uh,
this here's my ball.

14:32.433 --> 14:33.633
Oh. Ha ha!

14:33.633 --> 14:35.800
No. It's--
it's Elmo's ball.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.300
See? There's an "E"
right on the side,
right there.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.600
Uh, yeah.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.934
Well, uh-- uh,
that's not an "E."

14:41.934 --> 14:43.967
That's, um--
that's a smudge.

14:43.967 --> 14:47.533
- Yeah, and, uh,
my name is Smudge.

14:47.533 --> 14:50.333
Yeah. That's what people
call me-- Smudge.

14:50.333 --> 14:54.967
Well, it's not very kind
to keep somebody's ball,
Smudge.

14:54.967 --> 14:57.834
Who's Smudge?

14:57.834 --> 15:00.367
Uh, yeah,
that's right.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.600
Boy, how does Smudge
have any friends

15:02.600 --> 15:04.400
if Smudge won't share?

15:04.400 --> 15:06.667
Well, I don't have
any friends.

15:06.667 --> 15:09.400
All the other kids
just take your stuff.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.600
Hang on!
Elmo has a great idea!

15:12.600 --> 15:15.000
It's Christmas Eve.
You keep the ball.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
- Merry Christmas, Smudge.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.400
Hey.
What's wrong with it?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.133
Wait a minute.
Did you see that flash?

15:21.133 --> 15:23.266
Yeah, yeah.
So, what's the big deal?

15:23.266 --> 15:24.934
I mean,
what are you up to,

15:24.934 --> 15:26.400
trying to give me
this ball?

15:26.400 --> 15:27.567
Oh, nothing.

15:27.567 --> 15:29.633
Elmo's just
trying to be kind.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.767
- It's a Christmas gift.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.233
Ha ha! Wha?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.400
There it is again!
Oh, it came from
over there.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.934
Come on, Smudge!
Let's go look!

15:36.934 --> 15:38.500
Wait. Hey, listen.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.800
I think you're
up to something.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.834
I mean, why aren't you
trying to get this ball back?

15:42.834 --> 15:45.433
I mean, uh--
I mean my ball
and not back.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.400
Huh? It's mine.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.834
Om, okay.
Well, Merry Christmas.

15:50.834 --> 15:57.000
Yeah? Yeah, well,
good luck finding your ball!

16:02.600 --> 16:07.500
Wow!
What is this place?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.834
Wow!

16:09.834 --> 16:13.467
Oh! Wow!

16:13.467 --> 16:14.900
Ha ha ha!

16:14.900 --> 16:16.633
Oh, oh! Hello!

16:16.633 --> 16:18.333
Is

16:18.333 --> 16:21.100
Oh, sunshine!

16:21.100 --> 16:24.834
Oh, isn't it amazing?
Holly, look? Oh!

16:24.834 --> 16:27.767
- Oh, it's so good to get
some fresh air in here.
- Ha ha hee hee!

16:27.767 --> 16:29.700
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.767
Hi. I'm Bella.
Nice to meet you.

16:31.767 --> 16:32.867
Welcome. Oh!

16:32.867 --> 16:35.133
Maybe you can tell me.
What day is it?

16:35.133 --> 16:37.834
Oh, well, it's--
it's Christmas Eve!

16:37.834 --> 16:40.300
Christmas Eve?
Christmas Eve!

16:40.300 --> 16:41.433
Holly,
do you hear that?

16:41.433 --> 16:43.367
Oh, it's the most
magicalest eve

16:43.367 --> 16:45.500
before the most magicalest
day of the year!

16:45.500 --> 16:47.900
- Yeah!
- Holly, Holly,

16:47.900 --> 16:49.100
there really is
hope this year.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.133
I feel it.
Do you feel it?

16:51.133 --> 16:54.500
Huh? Oh!
I feel my back.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.934
Oh, I've got
a kink in my cogs.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.700
Oh. I've got a hunch
today could be the day.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.066
- Elmo: Wait a minute.
Elmo doesn't understand.

17:03.066 --> 17:05.367
What's Bella
talking about, Daddy?

17:05.367 --> 17:08.500
What does Bella mean,
"Today could be the day"?

17:08.500 --> 17:10.734
Oh, well, Elmo,

17:10.734 --> 17:14.500
this shop was
a very special shop.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.867
It only appeared
when someone on
Sesame Street

17:18.867 --> 17:21.800
shared
the holiday spirit.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.433
Oh. Oh, like great-great
grandmonster Elmo?

17:25.433 --> 17:27.300
- Ha ha! That's right!
- Ha ha hee hee!

17:27.300 --> 17:31.200
He had the spirit
and so did Bella,

17:31.200 --> 17:34.367
but they were just about
the only ones.

17:34.367 --> 17:35.533
Hmm.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.400
Hang on.
Let me try something.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.600
Okay.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.900
Merry Christmas!

17:41.900 --> 17:42.967
Elmo: Oh.

17:42.967 --> 17:44.400
Okay.
Elmo, help me.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.066
Say Merry Christmas
along with me, okay?

17:46.066 --> 17:47.567
- Oh, sure!

17:47.567 --> 17:50.166
- Uh-huh.
- One, two, three!

17:50.166 --> 17:54.467
Both:
Merry Christmas!

17:54.467 --> 17:57.834
Sorry.
Not a light.

17:57.834 --> 17:59.467
Yeah.
Holly's never wrong.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.066
Well,
wrong about what?

18:01.066 --> 18:02.567
Oh, the holiday spirit.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.333
It really
lights her up,

18:04.333 --> 18:05.900
and if there's enough
holiday spirit,

18:05.900 --> 18:07.300
do you know
who will come?

18:07.300 --> 18:09.967
Santa?
- That's right!

18:09.967 --> 18:14.033
But not until all five
of my lights are lit.

18:14.033 --> 18:18.000
And look!
Not even one.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.467
But, Holly, I'm sure Elmo
can help light up
all your lights.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.400
- Yeah!

18:23.400 --> 18:25.533
- Well, that's
a good question.
- Hmm.

18:25.533 --> 18:27.867
Well, I know to bring
holiday spirit,

18:27.867 --> 18:30.700
a lot of people decorate
to brighten things up, but--

18:30.700 --> 18:34.166
Oh, oh, oh!
Then that's what
Elmo's gonna do!

18:34.166 --> 18:36.934
- Holiday, holi-yay!
- Yay!

18:36.934 --> 18:39.100
Oh, and Elmo knows
where to get help!

18:39.100 --> 18:41.433
- Oh, sure.

18:41.433 --> 18:43.367
Oh, Elmo just made
a new friend.

18:43.367 --> 18:44.967
Oh, stay right here.
Be right back.

18:44.967 --> 18:46.767
- Bella: Okay.
- Holly: Oh!

18:46.767 --> 18:49.767
Oh, Smudge,
Smudge, Smudge!

18:49.767 --> 18:51.600
Oh, yeah,
that's me. Hey.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.567
Hi! Oh,
Elmo and Smudge

18:53.567 --> 18:55.700
have to raise
the holiday spirit!

18:55.700 --> 18:58.734
Oh, that way,
Santa will come
to Sesame Street.

18:58.734 --> 19:01.667
Yeah. Well, you know,
I been thinking
about that.

19:01.667 --> 19:05.233
There ain't no way
you're gonna get that guy
to come here.

19:05.233 --> 19:06.700
Well, why not?

19:06.700 --> 19:09.400
Well, for one thing,
someone would probably
steal his horses.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.934
- Reindeer.

19:10.934 --> 19:13.667
Reindeer.
Santa flies
in a magical sleigh

19:13.667 --> 19:15.400
pulled by
eight reindeer.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.033
Okay. You know,
now I know you're
putting me on.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.166
You know, is this
some big joke, right?

19:20.166 --> 19:21.533
No. No, Smudge!

19:21.533 --> 19:24.400
See, Holly said if we
light up all of her lights,

19:24.400 --> 19:25.700
then Santa will come.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.700
What

19:27.700 --> 19:29.834
Oh, oh. Holly.
You know, Holly and Bella.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.467
They run
the curiosity shop.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.500
Okay.
What curiosity shop?

19:33.500 --> 19:34.767
Oh. Oh, well,
it's right over here.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.934
Come on, Smudge!
Elmo will introduce you.

19:36.934 --> 19:40.000
Sheesh. Yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
That's really weird.
It-- it was just here.
It was like new.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.233
Yeah, yeah,
and I guess

19:45.233 --> 19:48.667
it just got all
magically rundown
and all, eh?

19:48.667 --> 19:50.000
- Elmo: Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.300
Hold the phone.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.000
What happened
to Bella and Holly?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Why weren't they
there anymore?

19:56.000 --> 20:00.033
I guess the holiday
spirit was too low.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.200
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.767
So, it was hopeless?

20:02.767 --> 20:04.734
There was nothing
they could do?

20:04.734 --> 20:06.800
Well, not exactly

20:06.800 --> 20:12.667
because great-great
grandmonster Elmo
kept thinking.

20:13.867 --> 20:15.367
Bella said
there was a way

20:15.367 --> 20:18.200
to bring the holiday spirit
to Sesame Street.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.567
Oh, yeah. Bella.

20:19.567 --> 20:24.000
Is that the invisible lady
in the invisible shop?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.367
What did she say?

20:25.367 --> 20:27.934
Oh, listen.
Forget about it!

20:27.934 --> 20:31.667
You may try,
but you're never gonna
get that guy here.

20:31.667 --> 20:32.700
- Sandy.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.033
- Santa
- Whatever.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.734
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.834
Lookit. Don't go trying
to bring the holidays here.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.400
You seem like
a bright guy.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.200
Bright!
That's it!

20:43.200 --> 20:46.633
- Th-that's what
Bella said!

20:46.633 --> 20:49.667
Decorations would
brighten everything up!

20:49.667 --> 20:51.800
Hmm.
What decorations?

20:51.800 --> 20:56.367
Oh! The decorations
we can put up right--

20:56.367 --> 20:57.734
boy, you know
you're right.

20:57.734 --> 20:58.900
What decorations?

20:58.900 --> 21:00.600
Elmo and Smudge
don't have any.

21:00.600 --> 21:05.233
Grover: Oddments,
carry-alls, bric-a-brac!

21:05.233 --> 21:07.266
Hey! Maybe he has
what we need.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.834
It is I,
your fuzzy and adorable

21:09.834 --> 21:13.200
and downtrodden
salesmonster.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.934
If you don't want it,
I got it.

21:14.934 --> 21:16.433
Excuse Elmo.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.066
Oh. No, I am sorry
little, red fellow,

21:18.066 --> 21:21.233
but I do not have any
"keep off the grass" signs

21:21.233 --> 21:23.367
or doormats
that say, "go away."

21:23.367 --> 21:25.066
But Elmo isn't looking
for those things.

21:25.066 --> 21:28.200
- No. Elmo's looking
for decorations.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.433
Decorations?

21:29.433 --> 21:31.467
I must not be on
Sesame Street anymore.

21:31.467 --> 21:33.600
No, no.
This is Sesame Street.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.633
Huh. Well,
because you asked,

21:35.633 --> 21:38.266
I actually do
have a cart full
of decorations.

21:38.266 --> 21:39.467
- Really.

21:39.467 --> 21:41.600
I loaded them up because
today is Christmas Eve.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.133
Then I came here.

21:43.133 --> 21:45.033
Oh, oh, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy!

21:45.033 --> 21:47.834
But, pray tell,
why are you interested
in decorations?

21:47.834 --> 21:50.934
Well, Elmo thought that
if we put up decorations,

21:50.934 --> 21:54.033
we might bring
some holiday spirit
to Sesame Street!

21:54.033 --> 21:56.500
That is
a great idea!

21:56.500 --> 21:58.300
And for you,
my friend,

21:58.300 --> 22:00.900
I will let you have
all the decorations
you want

22:00.900 --> 22:02.033
for a song.

22:02.033 --> 22:04.533
- Oh, oh, oh!

22:04.533 --> 22:06.467
No. Literally, I will
let you have them
for a song.

22:06.467 --> 22:10.967
And on top of that,
I shall kick it off myself!

Hop on my cute,

Oh, I'm Big Bird.

25:07.367 --> 25:09.000
You certainly are.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.100
- Uh, I am Grover,
this is Elmo.
- Hi!

25:12.100 --> 25:15.400
Oh, and this--
this here is Smudge.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.900
Yeah, hi.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.567
Well, it's nice
to meet you.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.367
I was on my way south
for the winter,

25:20.367 --> 25:22.367
and I saw the decorations
and thought,

25:22.367 --> 25:24.166
"This looks like
a friendly place."

25:24.166 --> 25:26.900
- Well...
- Yeah. Heh heh heh.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.734
Here.
Let me help you.

25:28.734 --> 25:31.166
- Whoa!
- Oh, thank you.

25:31.166 --> 25:33.900
- Oh!
- Hey!

25:33.900 --> 25:35.166
Elmo: Yeah!

25:35.166 --> 25:37.266
Wow!
Thank you, Big Bird.

25:37.266 --> 25:39.333
Hey.
What all the commotion?

25:39.333 --> 25:41.934
Oh, we're sorry
to bother you, Mr., um--

25:41.934 --> 25:43.133
Cookie Monster.

25:43.133 --> 25:45.200
- Oh! Hi!
- Hi.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.533
Boy, those cookies
look really good.

25:48.533 --> 25:50.367
These cookies
not for sale.

25:50.367 --> 25:52.033
Oh.

25:52.033 --> 25:54.200
Psst. Elmo.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.934
What?

25:56.934 --> 26:00.533
Hey! What is this tree
doing here?

26:00.533 --> 26:04.500
There's
no trees allowed!

26:04.500 --> 26:06.967
But, but, but!

26:06.967 --> 26:09.400
Oh, dear.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.800
Look, I didn't
wanna say it in front of
the other two,

26:12.800 --> 26:14.633
well, and it's all nice

26:14.633 --> 26:16.567
that you're hanging
all those things up...

26:16.567 --> 26:19.667
- ...but I just didn't
want you to get your hopes up

26:19.667 --> 26:24.033
because, well,
nothing ever magical
happens here.

26:24.033 --> 26:26.100
- This is Sesame Street

26:26.100 --> 26:30.934
and it doesn't matter
how many times you say
Merry Christmas, huh?

26:30.934 --> 26:32.767
Ah, ah, ah.

26:32.767 --> 26:34.166
Let me finish.

26:34.166 --> 26:37.033
You know, this is the most
unfriendliest street--

26:37.033 --> 26:39.700
D-d-did you
see that?

26:39.700 --> 26:41.934
What? Something
happen behind me?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.433
T-t-t-the shop!

26:43.433 --> 26:46.000
- Ha ha ha!

26:46.000 --> 26:48.433
What? Is it the one
you were talking about?

26:48.433 --> 26:51.200
- Yep!
- Uh, zowie!

26:51.200 --> 26:52.800
Yeah!
Oh, come on!

26:52.800 --> 26:54.433
Let's go see
if Holly's lit up.

26:54.433 --> 26:57.266
Yeah, yeah,
let's go, let's go.

26:57.266 --> 26:58.600
Wow.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.166
I-- I gotta
be dreaming!

27:01.166 --> 27:03.700
Elmo told you
it was real!

27:03.700 --> 27:05.834
I just
can't believe it!

27:05.834 --> 27:07.600
Wow! Would you look
at the street?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.100
Oh, it's so festive.

27:10.100 --> 27:12.800
Oh, oh.
Wait a minute.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.033
Huh?

27:14.033 --> 27:16.934
- Mm-mm-mm.

27:16.934 --> 27:18.533
Oh. Well,
what's that?

27:18.533 --> 27:19.734
It's a menorah.

27:19.734 --> 27:21.834
It's a symbol
of the holiday Hanukkah.

27:21.834 --> 27:23.800
What?
Another holiday?

27:23.800 --> 27:27.734
Oh, yes.
The holiday season
is full of holidays.

27:27.734 --> 27:29.667
Hanukkah is
a festival of lights.

27:29.667 --> 27:34.100
For eight days,
we light a candle
to remember a time long ago.

27:34.100 --> 27:36.834
- Oh! Cool!
- Bella: Yeah!

27:36.834 --> 27:39.333
- Big Bird: Elmo!
- Come on, Smudge!

27:39.333 --> 27:40.934
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

27:40.934 --> 27:42.734
Elmo!

27:42.734 --> 27:44.800
- Ha ha hee!
- There you are!

27:44.800 --> 27:47.900
Oh, Elmo, it looks like
you brought some friends.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.033
Oh, yeah.
They helped Elmo decorate.

27:50.033 --> 27:52.567
Oh, this is Grover,
and that's Big Bird!

27:52.567 --> 27:54.400
Hi! I'm Bella.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.834
Hang on.

27:55.834 --> 27:57.533
Uh, where did you
come from?

27:57.533 --> 27:59.934
Oh, everywhere
and nowhere.

27:59.934 --> 28:01.033
All: Huh?

28:01.033 --> 28:02.533
Well, you could say
it's our job

28:02.533 --> 28:04.400
to give the holiday
spirit a boost.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.300
Ugh, ugh.
What's going on here?

28:07.300 --> 28:10.333
And this is Holly.
Holly, look at you!

28:10.333 --> 28:12.834
Will you look at that?

28:12.834 --> 28:16.533
I've got one,
two lights on!

28:16.533 --> 28:17.934
Wow!

28:17.934 --> 28:19.767
Grover: Ooh!

28:19.767 --> 28:22.166
Well, wait a minute.
Now there's only one light.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.734
It happens.

28:23.734 --> 28:27.867
The decorations are nice,
but as you can see
by my lights,

28:27.867 --> 28:30.834
the holiday spirit
hasn't gone up much.

28:34.066 --> 28:36.200
- Holly: Hmm.
- But, hey, you got one light.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.066
I didn't even think
you'd get that.

28:38.066 --> 28:39.600
Don't be too hard
on yourselves.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.233
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get Santa to Sesame Street?

28:42.233 --> 28:45.100
Ooh. Santa's going to
start flying soon.

28:45.100 --> 28:48.533
It's going to be hard
raising that much
spirit in time.

28:48.533 --> 28:50.033
- Elmo: Hold on a second.

28:50.033 --> 28:51.300
All: Hmm?

28:51.300 --> 28:52.667
This isn't fair!

28:52.667 --> 28:54.333
Well, I guess
it's a good thing

28:54.333 --> 28:57.900
your great-great grandmonster
wasn't one to give up

28:57.900 --> 29:00.400
even though things
seemed difficult.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.100
Oh, well,
what did he do, Daddy?
What did he do?

29:02.100 --> 29:04.900
Ha ha! Well,
it was at that moment

29:04.900 --> 29:07.767
that something caught
their attention.

29:07.767 --> 29:11.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
may we have your attention?

29:11.600 --> 29:14.200
Right this way,
right this way!

29:14.200 --> 29:15.900
Yes, yes!

29:15.900 --> 29:19.834
My old buddy Ernie and I
are traveling performers!

29:19.834 --> 29:21.433
Wait a second,
Bert!

29:21.433 --> 29:23.900
I thought you said
we were performing
travelers!

29:23.900 --> 29:25.600
- That's what I printed

29:25.600 --> 29:27.633
on my business cards
and everything.

29:29.533 --> 29:31.500
Ernie.

29:31.500 --> 29:35.133
Anyway, we are here
to sing for you.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.000
Bert:

Isn't that great?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.767
Yes.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!

30:26.300 --> 30:28.333
There no singing
on Sesame Street!

30:28.333 --> 30:30.066
- Monster: Come on!

30:30.066 --> 30:33.667
You heard them!
No singing on Sesame Street!

30:33.667 --> 30:38.233
Now disperse!
All of you, disperse!

30:38.233 --> 30:40.200
We're available
for birthday parties!

30:42.834 --> 30:45.200
Hey!
Elmo has an idea.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.500
What is it?

30:46.500 --> 30:49.333
Well, maybe more of
Holly's lights will go on

30:49.333 --> 30:52.734
if Elmo and his friends
sing a Christmas song.

30:52.734 --> 30:54.834
But you heard what
the constable just said.

30:54.834 --> 30:57.033
No singing on
Sesame Street.

30:57.033 --> 30:59.166
Well, Elmo has
an idea about that, too,

30:59.166 --> 31:02.333
but we're all gonna
have to work together,
everybody, okay?

31:02.333 --> 31:04.000
- All right, all right.
- Yeah.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.500
Now, here's what
we're gonna do.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.500
First, we're gonna...

31:07.500 --> 31:10.033
Ah! Hey, hey, hey!
Here he comes.

31:10.033 --> 31:12.700
Ahem!
Good evening,
your constableness.

31:12.700 --> 31:15.734
Nice to see you,
and what an opportune moment.

31:15.734 --> 31:18.800
Have we got
a special offer
for you today!

31:18.800 --> 31:20.700
I'm not interested.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.300
Oh, ho! But I think
you will be, sir,

31:23.300 --> 31:25.166
when you see
what I have.

31:25.166 --> 31:27.700
Mm, what is it?

31:27.700 --> 31:30.633
Why, this
is a special viewer

31:30.633 --> 31:34.100
that allows you to view
many exciting views

31:34.100 --> 31:35.400
from all around
the world.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.100
You mean, like--
like pictures?

31:37.100 --> 31:38.533
- Mm-hmm.

31:38.533 --> 31:41.066
Cheese.
All kinds of cheese.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.166
- Blue cheese.
- Uh, cheddar cheese.

31:43.166 --> 31:44.734
Gorgonzola!

31:44.734 --> 31:46.166
Eh,
I don't like cheese.

31:46.166 --> 31:48.066
Oh, wait until
you see the brie.

31:48.066 --> 31:50.734
It's almost like you can
reach out and smell it.

31:50.734 --> 31:51.967
Here. Take a look.

31:51.967 --> 31:53.400
Oh! What are you doing?

31:53.400 --> 31:54.500
Go, go, go.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.900
Constable:
I can't see a thing.

31:55.900 --> 31:58.133
That is because we have not
put the cheese in yet, sir.

31:58.133 --> 32:00.166
Let us start
with the muenster.
We'll work up to a brie.

32:00.166 --> 32:01.767
Excellent choice.

Isn't it exciting?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.767
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that singing I hear?

32:35.767 --> 32:38.166
Uh-- uh,
yes, it is.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.734
It is all
part of the effect,

32:39.734 --> 32:41.667
but if you do not like it,
we can fix that.

32:41.667 --> 32:44.500
- Constable: Ohh!
- Hold still. There!

32:44.500 --> 32:46.367
Now you will not

33:57.633 --> 34:00.000
- Merry Christmas!
- Bye-bye.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.667
That was great.
Now what?

34:01.667 --> 34:04.700
Run for it! Aah!

34:04.700 --> 34:06.934
- Elmo: Whoa!

34:06.934 --> 34:09.400
- Stop!
Aah aah aah!

34:09.400 --> 34:13.533
Come back!
Ohh. Where'd everybody go?

34:13.533 --> 34:15.633
Hey! Hold it, you!

34:15.633 --> 34:18.900
- That's right.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.567
I'm starting
to get the feeling

34:20.567 --> 34:23.200
there's something fishy
going on here.

34:23.200 --> 34:26.033
I ought to
run you in right now,

34:26.033 --> 34:29.934
but I'll let you off
with a warning.

34:29.934 --> 34:32.734
Well, that's awful
nice of you, Dad.

34:32.734 --> 34:35.133
Oh, don't mention it.

34:35.133 --> 34:36.467
See you at home.

34:36.467 --> 34:38.900
- Oh.
- Be careful
crossing the street!

34:38.900 --> 34:41.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:41.667 --> 34:45.400
Did I just do
something kind?

34:45.400 --> 34:48.600
Brr!

34:48.600 --> 34:50.967
Whoa!
That was a close one.

34:50.967 --> 34:52.800
- Bella: Yoo-hoo!
- Whoa!

34:52.800 --> 34:54.767
Merry Christmas!

34:54.767 --> 34:57.600
Oh, wow!
Would you look at
all those happy faces?

34:57.600 --> 34:59.400
There's something
happening in this town.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.233
- Oh, yeah!
- And look.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.700
Hmm? Oh, wow!

35:03.700 --> 35:05.433
Another one
of my lights is lit.

35:05.433 --> 35:07.100
Isn't that great?

35:07.100 --> 35:09.600
Oh, um, Holly,
you seem a little--

35:09.600 --> 35:14.200
Lit up?
The holiday spirit
really, um, fills Holly.

35:14.200 --> 35:17.066
Holiday, holi-yay,
right?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.300
- Oh.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.300
There were
three lights.

35:25.300 --> 35:26.467
- I saw!
- Yeah.

35:26.467 --> 35:28.033
Did we do
something wrong?

35:28.033 --> 35:31.200
We put up decorations
and sang a delightful
seasonal song.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.867
You guys did great,
and you should be super
proud of yourselves,

35:34.867 --> 35:38.600
but officially,
all of holly's lights
have to be lit up

35:38.600 --> 35:40.000
in order for
Santa to come.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.734
And now
I only have two.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.633
- Elmo: Wait a minute,
Daddy.

35:45.633 --> 35:47.900
Stop the story,
stop the story.

35:47.900 --> 35:49.700
Boy, Elmo
doesn't understand.

35:49.700 --> 35:51.967
They tried so hard.

35:51.967 --> 35:53.600
Well, Elmo,

35:53.600 --> 35:58.400
sometimes,
things work out different
than you want them to.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.066
You know, Daddy,
Elmo's got to tell you

36:00.066 --> 36:02.100
this is not a very happy
Christmas story

36:02.100 --> 36:04.367
to be telling
a little monster
on Christmas Eve, okay?

36:04.367 --> 36:06.333
Besides, you haven't
even told Elmo

36:06.333 --> 36:08.567
why we leave cookies
for Santa.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.500
Ha ha!
I'm getting there, son.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.767
Besides,
it's not over yet

36:13.767 --> 36:18.700
because as they were
wondering what to do next...

36:18.700 --> 36:20.667
All: Hmm.

36:20.667 --> 36:22.767
- Oh, Bella!

36:22.767 --> 36:25.900
Eh, I bet they're gone
for good this time.

36:25.900 --> 36:28.433
Maybe we should
give up.

36:28.433 --> 36:30.000
You could be right.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.500
It is too difficult

36:31.500 --> 36:33.367
to bring this kind
of holiday spirit
to Sesame Street.

36:33.367 --> 36:36.333
My little body
cannot take it anymore.

36:36.333 --> 36:39.934
Well,
at least we tried.

36:39.934 --> 36:42.233
Bye.

36:42.233 --> 36:43.600
Good-bye.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.900
Ernie:
Bye-bye.

36:44.900 --> 36:48.367
Eh, I knew it was
too good to be true,

36:48.367 --> 36:52.767
but, uh, you know, I got to
hand it to you-- hey, Elmo.

36:52.767 --> 36:54.033
You listening?

36:54.033 --> 36:55.867
Oh, oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, Smudge.

36:55.867 --> 36:57.900
- Elmo's just wondering.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.900
Why were there
two lights on at all?

36:59.900 --> 37:01.467
I don't know.

37:01.467 --> 37:04.433
I thought it was
because of the singing
and the decorations.

37:04.433 --> 37:06.266
Well, yeah, that's
what Elmo thought, too,

37:06.266 --> 37:09.200
but now Elmo's
not so sure.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.934
Hmm.

37:10.934 --> 37:15.367
Maybe those things
aren't really what's
making Holly light up.

37:15.367 --> 37:18.100
What could it be,
Smudge?

37:18.100 --> 37:21.300
Uh, I don't know.

37:24.633 --> 37:27.300
Hey. Uh, hey, Elmo.

37:27.300 --> 37:29.767
Uh, you think
about it, all right?

37:29.767 --> 37:31.734
Um, I'm gonna be
right back.

37:31.734 --> 37:33.233
Yeah.

37:33.233 --> 37:35.667
Okay.

37:40.734 --> 37:43.800
Hope everyone is having
a yucky Crankymas.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.400
Worst
Crankymas ever!

37:45.400 --> 37:48.066
Everybody, raise
a glass of sludge.

37:48.066 --> 37:52.867
I just want to say
the best thing about
Crankymas is--

37:52.867 --> 37:56.400
is the special grouchy
feeling I get inside.

37:57.600 --> 38:01.266
Now we can all say, "scram,"
or, "have a rotten day,"

38:01.266 --> 38:02.934
just one day a year,

38:02.934 --> 38:06.800
but I say why not try to
make every day Crankymas?

38:06.800 --> 38:08.166
- Every day!
- Oh, yeah!

38:08.166 --> 38:10.400
Because,
my fellow grouches,

38:10.400 --> 38:12.100
Crankymas
isn't just a day,

38:12.100 --> 38:15.000
cranky is a feeling
that comes from
deep inside,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.633
so let's be cranky
all year round.

38:17.633 --> 38:19.867
Cheers!
Yucky Crankymas!

38:19.867 --> 38:23.767
Yucky Crankymas!

38:23.767 --> 38:26.367
- And a horrible New Year!
- Oh, ho!

38:26.367 --> 38:27.500
Heh heh heh!

38:27.500 --> 38:29.500
Grouch #2:
Oh, many grouchy returns!

38:31.633 --> 38:33.033
Grouch:
Can I get the recipe?

38:33.033 --> 38:35.934
Boy, we did
all that decorating,

38:35.934 --> 38:38.333
sang all those songs,

38:38.333 --> 38:42.533
and the only real
holiday on Sesame Street
is Crankymas.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.266
Oh, what's the use?

38:55.467 --> 38:57.867
Hey, uh, Elmo.

38:57.867 --> 38:59.000
Yeah?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.100
Well, this is
a little hard to say.

39:01.100 --> 39:04.767
Um, well, I don't have
a Christmas present,

39:04.767 --> 39:09.200
but, um,
this is for you.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.900
You're giving Elmo
his ball back?

39:11.900 --> 39:15.667
Well, uh, I shouldn't have
taken it in the first place,

39:15.667 --> 39:19.233
and anyway, I figure
if I give it back to you,

39:19.233 --> 39:22.700
then, uh,
we could play together,
you know, you and me.

39:22.700 --> 39:24.700
Wha?

39:24.700 --> 39:27.333
You're a really
good friend.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.200
Ha ha ha ha!

39:29.200 --> 39:32.734
Well, uh, anyhoo,
I just wanted you to know

39:32.734 --> 39:35.667
what you did today
really meant something,

39:35.667 --> 39:39.700
and, uh,
Merry Christmas, Elmo.

39:39.700 --> 39:42.567
Wha?
Oh, ho ho ho!

39:42.567 --> 39:45.200
Merry Christmas,
Smudge.

39:45.200 --> 39:48.800
Uh, yeah.
Um, my name's Becky.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.400
Wha? Ha ha ha!

39:50.400 --> 39:54.433
- Well,
Merry Christmas, Becky.
- Ha! Merry Christmas.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.467
Whoa! Did--
did you see that?

39:56.467 --> 40:00.467
Yeah!
Oh, that happened
when Elmo gave you his ball.

40:00.467 --> 40:03.734
Oh. Hey.
That was very kind
of you, by the way.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.800

Looks like
it belongs here.

41:29.467 --> 41:31.066
- Heh heh.
- All: Aww.

41:31.066 --> 41:33.033
Good job, guys!

41:33.033 --> 41:36.533
- Those were really
kind things you did.
- All: Aww.

41:36.533 --> 41:41.233
And kindness is what
the holiday spirit
is all about.

41:41.233 --> 41:42.800
Would you look
at that?

41:42.800 --> 41:44.200
She's really lit!

41:44.200 --> 41:48.533
Yeah! Hey!
Holly has four lights now.

41:48.533 --> 41:50.433
Guys,
this is amazing.

41:50.433 --> 41:51.433
Yeah!

41:52.500 --> 41:55.066
Look.
Up in the sky!

41:55.066 --> 41:56.900
Elmo:
That's Santa!

41:56.900 --> 41:58.800
- It is. It is Santa!

41:58.800 --> 42:00.333
- Santa, Santa!
- Come on, guys!
Come look.

42:00.333 --> 42:01.767
- Oh, yeah. I see him.
- Yes!

42:01.767 --> 42:04.500
Look. It's Santa!
Look. There he is.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.500
- Aww.
- All: Aww.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.800
Santa, he flew
right past Sesame Street.

42:11.800 --> 42:14.133
I suppose it is
because we could not get

42:14.133 --> 42:16.700
all of Holly's lights
to light up.

42:16.700 --> 42:20.066
Uh, hey.

42:20.066 --> 42:23.066
Hey. You guys tried,
you know, and look.

42:23.066 --> 42:27.200
Sesame Street's, like,
the friendliest street
around now.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.533
I mean, who'd
have thunk, huh?

42:29.533 --> 42:32.200
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's true.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.066
What more could
anyone ask for?

42:34.066 --> 42:38.367
Wow!
Everybody so kind.

42:38.367 --> 42:41.433
You know what?
Me want to try
this kindness thing.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.767
Uh, here.
Have a cookie.

42:43.767 --> 42:45.300
All:
Have a cookie?!

42:45.300 --> 42:48.867
Cookie Monster,
are you sharing
your cookies now?

42:48.867 --> 42:52.300
That right.
Merry Christmas,
everybody.

42:52.300 --> 42:53.667
Oh, wow!

42:53.667 --> 42:54.767
Yeah, here.
Take a cookie.

42:54.767 --> 42:58.166
Take a chocolate chippie.

42:58.166 --> 42:59.800
Look!

42:59.800 --> 43:02.633
What?
What's happening?

43:02.633 --> 43:04.100
Oh, look!

43:04.100 --> 43:06.600
All five
of my lights are lit!

43:06.600 --> 43:09.533
That's five,
five festive lights.

43:09.533 --> 43:11.433
Ah ah ah!

43:11.433 --> 43:12.734
( organ playing,
thunder )

43:14.233 --> 43:15.900
You did it,
Cookie Monster!

43:15.900 --> 43:18.066
You made all of
Holly's lights light up!

43:18.066 --> 43:20.600
- Yeah!
- Oh, wow!

43:20.600 --> 43:23.834
Me not know what that mean,
but that terrific!

43:23.834 --> 43:25.767
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

43:25.767 --> 43:30.233
Oh, but it is too late
for Santa to come now.
He flew by.

43:30.233 --> 43:32.300
- Elmo: No, no, no, no, no.

43:32.300 --> 43:34.300
This can't be!

43:34.300 --> 43:36.200
Too late for Santa?

43:36.200 --> 43:38.400
Yeah, it's true,

43:38.400 --> 43:43.100
but you wanted to know
why we leave cookies
out for Santa.

43:43.100 --> 43:47.100
It's to remember
Cookie Monster's kind act.

43:47.100 --> 43:50.834
So, you're saying
Santa never came?

43:50.834 --> 43:53.834
Oh, I didn't
exactly say that.

43:53.834 --> 44:00.133
Well, because
at that very moment
in Santa's sleigh...

44:00.133 --> 44:01.367
What's happening?

44:02.900 --> 44:06.500
Uh, there must be
some type of mistake
on the grid, sir.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.567
We really are on
a tight schedule, though,

44:08.567 --> 44:10.533
so if we could
just stay straight.

44:10.533 --> 44:14.333
Well, it looks
like a new stop.

44:14.333 --> 44:17.967
Yeah, right, but it's
much too far behind us now.

44:17.967 --> 44:20.467
We-- we couldn't
possibly turn in time--

44:20.467 --> 44:22.467
Wind or gale,
we can make an exception

44:22.467 --> 44:25.900
for any street
that glows that bright.

44:25.900 --> 44:29.200
- Yes, sir.
- Dancer, Prancer, about turn!

44:29.200 --> 44:31.800
To Sesame Street!

44:31.800 --> 44:34.066
- Ho ho ho ho!
- Hoo hoo hoo!

44:40.667 --> 44:42.500
Oh! Oh, hey!
Look, look, look!

44:42.500 --> 44:44.033
It's Santa!

44:44.033 --> 44:45.333
Oh! He's coming back!

44:45.333 --> 44:46.967
Hey!

44:49.700 --> 44:51.667
Girl: Oh! Oh!

44:51.667 --> 44:54.433
- It is him!
- Ah ah ah! Yeah.

45:00.166 --> 45:02.133
Girl:
Hi, Santa!

45:02.133 --> 45:04.934
- Becky: Santa!
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

45:04.934 --> 45:06.567
- Ho ho ho ho!
- Merry Christmas!

45:06.567 --> 45:09.333
Look, everybody!
Santa came here!

45:09.333 --> 45:12.133
- Uh, you're
Santa Claus, right?
- That's right.

45:12.133 --> 45:16.967
The holiday spirit here is
so great at Sesame Street.

45:16.967 --> 45:18.800
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.900
All: Aww.

45:20.900 --> 45:23.033
Well, I'll tell you what,
it was all his doing.

45:23.033 --> 45:26.266
Yeah. Elmo.
It was his idea.

45:26.266 --> 45:27.734
Uh, uh, uh...

45:27.734 --> 45:30.967
Is that right?
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Elmo.

45:30.967 --> 45:32.967
Ha ha! Ha ha hee!

45:32.967 --> 45:35.066
Hi, Santa.
Ha ha ha!

45:35.066 --> 45:38.233
Ha ha.
Yeah, he's a bit
nervous, you know?

45:38.233 --> 45:40.533
Anyway,
it was his idea

45:40.533 --> 45:43.934
to help bring the holiday
spirit to Sesame Street,

45:43.934 --> 45:47.000
and, well, I guess
all of us kind of
pitched in, right?

45:47.000 --> 45:50.400
- Well, you could say that.
- Yeah, right.

45:50.400 --> 45:55.867
It's so wonderful to
meet someone who believes
so much in the holidays, Elmo.

45:55.867 --> 45:58.467
Oh, well,
thank you, Santa.

45:58.467 --> 45:59.900
Ha ha ha!

45:59.900 --> 46:02.567
And then there was
this Bella lady

46:02.567 --> 46:05.233
who taught us about
the holiday spirit.

46:05.233 --> 46:06.567
Bella:
Yoo-hoo!

46:06.567 --> 46:08.600
Hello, Mr. Claus.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.867
Well, I should have known
you would be here.

46:10.867 --> 46:12.900
Now where's Holly?

46:12.900 --> 46:15.333
Ooh!
Uh, right here!

46:15.333 --> 46:19.166
I haven't
seen you in forever,
not since Grumpy Falls.

46:19.166 --> 46:20.700
It's true.

46:20.700 --> 46:22.934
We didn't much luck
raising holiday spirit,

46:22.934 --> 46:25.467
not until this
little monster
came along.

46:25.467 --> 46:30.367
Well, you all gave
the greatest gift
of all-- kindness.

46:30.367 --> 46:32.967
All: Aww.

46:32.967 --> 46:36.300
And I've got a gift
for everyone here,
even you, Grover.

46:36.300 --> 46:38.333
Oh, boy!

46:38.333 --> 46:39.867
This is for Rosa.

46:39.867 --> 46:43.166
I must admit
we were right
to stop here, sir.

46:43.166 --> 46:45.133
Look at that.
That's so nice.

46:45.133 --> 46:47.767
- Here you go.
- Becky: Oh, thanks.

46:47.767 --> 46:50.000
This is for Grover.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.567
- Ohh.

46:53.567 --> 46:55.033
Ohh.

46:55.033 --> 46:56.633
Oh, hey, Bert,
can you believe it?

46:56.633 --> 46:59.233
This Christmas just
keeps getting better.
It's snowing.

46:59.233 --> 47:03.166
Snowing? Ernie,
that's impossible.
It can't be snowing.

47:03.166 --> 47:05.633
Oh, sure it can, Bert.
Right up there. Look.

47:08.333 --> 47:10.000
Do you see
the snow now, Bert?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.467
- Heh heh heh!

47:12.467 --> 47:15.700
- Good-bye, Elmo.

47:15.700 --> 47:18.367
- That's right.

47:18.367 --> 47:20.166
Holly and I are off
to the next town

47:20.166 --> 47:23.200
that needs
some holiday spirit,
but thank you.

47:23.200 --> 47:24.934
We couldn't have
done it without you.

47:24.934 --> 47:26.867
That's right.

47:26.867 --> 47:29.834
Well, Elmo's
gonna miss you.

47:29.834 --> 47:32.567
Aw. We'll miss you,
too, Elmo.

47:32.567 --> 47:33.667
Merry Christmas.

47:33.667 --> 47:35.200
Merry Christmas.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.400
Hee hee hee!

47:36.400 --> 47:40.166
Oh, Santa,
uh, me want to thank you

47:40.166 --> 47:42.033
for coming to
Sesame Street.

47:42.033 --> 47:44.233
Oh. Well,
what is this?

47:44.233 --> 47:45.834
Uh, that a cookie.

47:45.834 --> 47:47.200
A cookie?

47:47.200 --> 47:49.867
Yeah, yeah.
A very special recipe.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.800
Oh, well.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.967
Mmm. Yum.

47:53.967 --> 47:56.133
This is something
I could get used to.

47:56.133 --> 48:00.900
Yeah, but, uh,
Santa, that not quite
how you eat it.

48:00.900 --> 48:03.367
- Uh-uh. Observe.

48:03.367 --> 48:07.433
Ahh, nom nom nom
nom nom nom nom!

48:07.433 --> 48:10.633
- Ho ho!
- Nom nom nom nom nom.

48:10.633 --> 48:12.400
I like
the way you do that.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.734
- Thank you.
- I'm writing a song.

48:14.734 --> 48:15.900
Really?

48:15.900 --> 48:18.266
"C is for"--
I can't think
of the next one.

48:18.266 --> 48:21.000
"C is for"-- hmm.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
No. "C is for hmm"
isn't right.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.100
- Cucumber.
- Cucumber!

48:25.100 --> 48:26.700
- No.
- No.

48:26.700 --> 48:30.667
"C" is for cookie,
but that good enough for me,
so me not sure about you.

48:30.667 --> 48:33.734
- No. It's not
good enough for Santa.
- Oh, boy. This a toughie.

48:33.734 --> 48:37.867
Louie: And ever since
that Christmas Eve
long, long ago,

48:37.867 --> 48:40.300
we leave cookies out
for Santa.

48:40.300 --> 48:42.100
A little
to the right.

48:42.100 --> 48:43.834
No. A little
to the left.

48:43.834 --> 48:45.500
Wait, wait,
wait, wait!

48:45.500 --> 48:47.100
Both: Perfect!

48:47.100 --> 48:49.300
Oh! Ha ha ha!

48:49.300 --> 48:50.934
Louie:
And how Sesame Street

48:50.934 --> 48:54.266
became known
as the friendliest
street in the world.

48:54.266 --> 48:57.433
Ah. There goes
the neighborhood.

48:57.433 --> 48:58.533
Eh.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.200
The end.

49:20.467 --> 49:22.934
Merry Christmas, Elmo.

49:22.934 --> 49:24.066
Heh heh.

49:51.333 --> 49:54.133
Ahh, nom nom nom nom!

49:54.133 --> 49:56.166
Merry Christmas!

49:56.166 --> 49:57.934
