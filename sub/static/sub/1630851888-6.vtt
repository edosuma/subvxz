in that same situation

35:19.952 --> 35:21.526
And she was in one state

35:21.620 --> 35:22.602
And you're in the other state
and, you know, it's so--

35:22.696 --> 35:24.028
- I'd be worried.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.530
Like, I'd want to take care
of him or like--

35:25.624 --> 35:26.848

had dinner on a beach?

35:54.544 --> 35:57.320

- Not in the last 12 hours.

35:57.472 --> 35:58.730
- Have you ever had
a group dinner on a beach?

35:58.824 --> 35:59.898
- No.
- Okay.

35:59.992 --> 36:00.824
- First one.
- I've never had

36:00.975 --> 36:02.308
A group dinner on a beach.

36:02.402 --> 36:04.719
- Definitely a first for me.

36:04.812 --> 36:06.830
- So what have y'all learned
about each other--

36:07.057 --> 36:08.665
Newer things that y'all
learned about each other?

36:08.892 --> 36:10.575
- I'm finding there are
so many similarities

36:10.669 --> 36:11.893
Between the two of us,

36:11.986 --> 36:13.653
But there are
definitely differences.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.397
- We're big on communication.

36:15.415 --> 36:17.156
I think we've figured out
very early on that the thing

36:17.250 --> 36:19.009
That we have very in common

36:19.236 --> 36:20.919
Is that we're both
really good communicators,

36:21.013 --> 36:22.253
And as soon as I felt
like something was off,

36:22.347 --> 36:23.755
I brought it up.

36:23.907 --> 36:25.256
Anytime, she feels
like something is off,

36:25.350 --> 36:27.166
She brought it up.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.268
We had our first disagreement
last night.

36:29.913 --> 36:32.247
It was rough,
and then we slept on it,

36:32.265 --> 36:34.691
Woke up, came out here,

36:34.918 --> 36:37.252
Talked about it--
I told her exactly how I feel--

36:37.345 --> 36:39.754
And I feel like
we got to a better place

36:39.773 --> 36:41.756
Because we're both just kind of

36:41.849 --> 36:43.591
Being open
and communicative about it.

36:43.610 --> 36:45.702
- I'm not gonna
speak for everybody.

36:45.853 --> 36:48.112
I appreciate
y'all sharing that with us

36:48.265 --> 36:49.873
Because that's helpful
for all of us to know

36:50.024 --> 36:51.041
That you can have
those discussions,

36:51.268 --> 36:53.376
Whether--they're gonna
be difficult,

36:53.603 --> 36:54.619

and it sounds like...

36:54.713 --> 36:55.937

36:57.941 --> 36:58.882

help all of us at some point.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.776
- What is
the hardest conversation

37:01.869 --> 37:03.845
Everyone here has had so far?

37:05.224 --> 37:09.133
- What I sort of look at
as one of my flaws is, like,

37:09.228 --> 37:12.303
I don't think I do well
at asking a lot of questions.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.472
- Sure.
- Just in general.

37:14.624 --> 37:15.807
So there are a lot
of conversations

37:15.901 --> 37:17.234
That we haven't had yet.

37:17.385 --> 37:18.309
I mean, we haven't
talked about money.

37:18.462 --> 37:20.144
We haven't talked
about last names.

37:20.297 --> 37:23.073
We haven't talked about
living arrangements.

37:23.224 --> 37:26.243
We haven't talked about, like,
a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff.

37:26.394 --> 37:30.154
To me, with the timeline,
to me, it feels normal

37:30.307 --> 37:32.490
To not have
those conversations so soon.

37:32.642 --> 37:34.567
- We're about the same
when it comes down

37:34.586 --> 37:36.569
To most of this stuff.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.071
Like, we have touched things
about living arrangements.

37:39.165 --> 37:40.573
That was the easy conversation.

37:40.667 --> 37:41.816
- We talk
about relationships.

37:41.909 --> 37:43.093
- We talked
about relationships.

37:43.244 --> 37:44.427
We haven't talked
about finance.

37:44.579 --> 37:46.321

a tough conversation...

37:53.272 --> 37:55.497

I wanna know how that goes.

37:55.515 --> 37:57.274
- So we'll see.

37:57.501 --> 37:59.501

at a very basic level

37:59.594 --> 38:00.926
When you touch
these deep subjects,

38:01.021 --> 38:03.688

38:03.782 --> 38:05.448

Afraid of what happens then?

38:05.600 --> 38:06.616
- It goes back to what...
- Yes.

38:06.768 --> 38:08.693
- Y'all both were saying,
communication.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.361
One thing I was asked from
one of our friends is, like,

38:10.455 --> 38:11.846
What about if she's--

38:11.939 --> 38:13.623
Hypothetically,
I'm a democrat

38:13.850 --> 38:15.292
And she's a republican?
Would that be an issue?

38:15.519 --> 38:16.518
- Oh, no, sir.
- No, I know you're not, but--

38:16.611 --> 38:18.128
[laughter]

38:18.279 --> 38:20.038
- Let's say...
- I don't even like that.

38:20.132 --> 38:21.689
- Let's say if she was,
would that'd be a dealbreaker?

38:21.708 --> 38:23.282
I said, absolutely not.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.376
- With the reverse, it would
be a dealbreaker for me.

38:25.529 --> 38:26.694
- For me, it wouldn't be.
- For me, it would.

38:26.788 --> 38:29.030
- For me, it wouldn't be.
I got you.

38:29.123 --> 38:31.215
- Can we get the check going?
- Check please.

38:31.368 --> 38:33.201
Divorce check.
- [laughs]

38:33.294 --> 38:34.293
- But for me,
it wouldn't be an issue

38:34.313 --> 38:37.314

38:37.465 --> 38:39.149
That doesn't matter

- Yeah.
Why?

1:00:46.644 --> 1:00:50.036
- And it's because we are--
we're older now.

1:00:50.055 --> 1:00:53.315
And as you age,
you become less flexible.

1:00:53.466 --> 1:00:58.728
You harden, and I know
I have, and I see areas

1:00:58.881 --> 1:01:02.473
Where I can do better,
and I'm working on it.

1:01:02.493 --> 1:01:06.386

yet well enough.

1:01:07.814 --> 1:01:09.164
- No.
- That's a big part.

1:01:09.391 --> 1:01:11.482
- And you learn a lot there.
That's huge.

1:01:11.576 --> 1:01:14.485
We've learned a lot here sure,
but it's a different thing

1:01:14.505 --> 1:01:17.564
When we're living together
and the routines sink in.

1:01:17.582 --> 1:01:21.418

as of me as a travel companion.

1:01:27.426 --> 1:01:30.852
For example, I know you
shower a few times a day.

1:01:32.356 --> 1:01:36.692
Honestly, I have actually
gone--I've seen weeks

1:01:36.843 --> 1:01:39.677
Where I've showered
that many times in a week.

1:01:39.771 --> 1:01:41.345
<i> [soft dramatic music]</i>

1:01:41.365 --> 1:01:44.700
I mean, most of the time
I shower once a day,

1:01:44.851 --> 1:01:48.019
But there have been times
in my life where I was just sad

1:01:48.038 --> 1:01:50.113
Or for some reason
something happened

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:53.934
And showering every single day
was not my top priority,

1:01:54.027 --> 1:01:55.769
And I just wanted
to lay in bed.

1:01:55.787 --> 1:01:59.363
There are times
when I'm so tired, I come home,

1:01:59.383 --> 1:02:00.607
Whatever I'm wearing,

1:02:00.625 --> 1:02:03.109
I will sometimes
just get in bed that way

1:02:03.128 --> 1:02:04.386
And not even brush my teeth
and not even floss.

1:02:04.537 --> 1:02:06.112

- Right.

1:02:06.131 --> 1:02:08.206

that happening for you.

- No, it I mean, it definitely
does happen for me.

1:02:10.043 --> 1:02:11.284
- I don't want you
to be disgusted.

1:02:11.303 --> 1:02:13.211
Like, "she is disgusting."

1:02:13.305 --> 1:02:15.230
- Definitely don't assume that.
It's just a preference.

1:02:15.381 --> 1:02:16.790
I'm expressing to you
that this is my preference.

1:02:16.883 --> 1:02:18.458
I would love it
if you're clean.

1:02:18.551 --> 1:02:19.976
- No, I love that
you're like that,

1:02:20.070 --> 1:02:24.722
But I--that's--that
will take some adjusting for me

1:02:24.742 --> 1:02:27.317
To be anywhere near like that.

1:02:27.411 --> 1:02:28.985

I'll ever get to the point

1:02:31.323 --> 1:02:32.973
- Okay.

1:02:32.991 --> 1:02:34.641
- I'm basically saying
every time you work out

1:02:34.659 --> 1:02:36.643
Or you're sweating,
don't bring it into the bed.

1:02:36.736 --> 1:02:38.161
- Okay.
- 'cause that's dirty.

1:02:38.255 --> 1:02:39.570
And then we'll have to change
our sheets every day.

1:02:39.664 --> 1:02:40.647

1:02:51.510 --> 1:02:52.842

1:02:52.995 --> 1:02:54.844
To get up and lift
a finger or do anything.

1:02:54.997 --> 1:02:56.921
- I think
you can sleep in the bed,

1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:59.349

You take care of the sheets.

1:02:59.501 --> 1:03:00.850

want to do that.
