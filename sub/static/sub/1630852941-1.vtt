Gosh. That's why we must catch him.

for every Red Cap incident.

with all of her clothes undressed.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.100
Police regarded this
as a rape and murder case...

18:27.100 --> 18:28.460
and launched an investigation.

18:28.460 --> 18:32.470
The police decided to investigate
whether this incident was related...

18:32.470 --> 18:35.570
to the so-called Red Cap Incident,
the sexual assault cases...

18:35.570 --> 18:38.340
that broke out one after another in Seoul.

18:38.670 --> 18:40.070
On April 10,

18:40.070 --> 18:41.740
a report was made by a woman in her 30s,

18:41.740 --> 18:45.350
a victim of sexual assault
from Hwayang-dong, Gwangjin-gu.

18:45.350 --> 18:46.810
May I help you?
This case was regarded...

18:46.810 --> 18:48.420
as a crime...

18:48.420 --> 18:50.520
Do you have a pinky?
done by the same culprit...

18:50.520 --> 18:52.790
I want to eat it.
as the so-called Red Cap Incident,

18:52.790 --> 18:55.510
and the case was transferred
to the Seoul Police Agency.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.980
Also, the police are...

19:01.060 --> 19:02.760
(Turtle Supermarket)

19:02.760 --> 19:04.600
It's this snack that looks like a pinky,

19:04.600 --> 19:06.530
covered in lots of chocolate.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.140
You made me scared!

19:12.070 --> 19:13.840
Look at that.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.340
I'm sorry.
A woman in her 20s was...

19:15.340 --> 19:17.950
That almost killed me.
found dead on a street.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.480
I'm a detective.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.250
You can relax.
When her mother...

19:21.250 --> 19:23.020
could not reach her daughter,

19:23.020 --> 19:24.150
she visited her house...

19:24.150 --> 19:26.150
Are you out? I wanted some.
and saw the scene first.

19:26.150 --> 19:27.710
You said you're a detective!

19:27.990 --> 19:31.090
Why do you need a chocolate snack
like a kid this late at night?

19:31.290 --> 19:34.200
One second.
The investigation began,

19:34.200 --> 19:36.800
but the witness isn't found.
These?

19:37.070 --> 19:38.190
Yes.

19:38.470 --> 19:39.630
(Pinky)

19:39.730 --> 19:41.040
May I have one more?

19:43.500 --> 19:44.640
Thank you.

19:46.110 --> 19:47.710
(Choi Hwa Yeon's home)

19:47.710 --> 19:48.780
What's going on?

19:48.780 --> 19:50.230
(Do Not Enter, Under Investigation)

19:50.650 --> 19:52.350
Goodness, tell me about it.

19:52.350 --> 19:54.150
That poor thing.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.480
Hey, where have you been?

19:58.820 --> 20:00.010
Goodness.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.130
Hello.
It's the girl from this house.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.720
Did it really happen?
Yes.

20:11.170 --> 20:14.070
My goodness.
That's horrible.

20:38.490 --> 20:40.730
Last night around 10 p.m.,
the victim's mother...

20:40.730 --> 20:42.560
confirmed her returning home.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.270
She couldn't reach her,
so she came to visit,

20:44.270 --> 20:45.530
then made a report.

20:52.540 --> 20:53.840
Where is her family?

20:53.840 --> 20:55.410
She has a mother,

20:55.410 --> 20:56.540
but her condition got worse...

20:56.540 --> 20:58.780
and was taken to the hospital an hour ago.

21:22.670 --> 21:24.410
She was in awful condition,

21:24.410 --> 21:26.960
so I just injected her
with a sedative and sleeping agent.

21:55.470 --> 21:56.970
Whenever he's at the crime scene,

21:56.970 --> 21:59.400
the first thing he does is
look for the bereaved family.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.400
If he was staging this,
he couldn't do it for so long.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.880
He's an outcast, but he has no idea.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.170
That's odd too, isn't it?

22:07.150 --> 22:08.550
Do you think he doesn't know?

22:09.480 --> 22:10.740
So he does?

22:10.990 --> 22:13.320
Then how can he be so cool about it?

22:14.260 --> 22:16.710
Don't you think he's the one
who's casting us out of his life?

22:17.260 --> 22:18.390
What?

22:18.660 --> 22:20.030
I heard he was kicked out
of Jungbu Police Station...

22:20.030 --> 22:21.920
because he had always been like this.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.870
Some say he's the nephew
of the commissioner.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.440
The son-in-law of the brother
of the third cousin of his in-law.

22:28.440 --> 22:32.110
Goodness, words get around weird
in this industry.

22:32.670 --> 22:33.980
Captain.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.740
Going back on a case
that his direct superior closed.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.910
It's impossible
without superhuman courage.

22:38.910 --> 22:40.080
Just do your job.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.780
Stop minding something unnecessary.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.550
And stop talking to me when I eat.

22:45.250 --> 22:46.350
Okay.

22:53.390 --> 22:55.560
You're home.
Yes.

22:55.830 --> 22:58.330
You look tired.
You should go to sleep.

22:58.330 --> 22:59.760
I will. Goodnight.

23:46.210 --> 23:48.880
Come on, Gil Pyo.
Stop following me.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.280
Hey, Gil Pyo.
Found it.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.050
This is really important.

23:52.050 --> 23:54.590
Hey, that cap criminal is
turning the world upside down.

23:54.590 --> 23:55.620
Why aren't you doing your job?

23:55.620 --> 23:58.230
Gil Pyo, there will come a day
when you'll say I was right.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.560
Hey! I'm about to lose my joints...

24:00.560 --> 24:01.860
running after this case.

24:01.860 --> 24:03.660
That's because of your age.
Darn you.

24:03.660 --> 24:05.170
You won't be young forever.

24:05.170 --> 24:07.440
(Chief of Special Crime Squad,
Heo Gil Pyo)

24:07.440 --> 24:09.940
We already have Forensics Squad.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.340
We don't have a ground...

24:11.340 --> 24:13.810
to establish
a scientific investigations team.

24:13.810 --> 24:15.680
Even an open-hearted guy like me...

24:15.680 --> 24:17.140
doesn't understand why we need that.

24:17.140 --> 24:19.550
But the men up there?
They won't understand a word.

24:19.550 --> 24:21.450
What? I explained it to you
time and time again.

24:21.450 --> 24:22.650
You still don't get it?

24:22.650 --> 24:25.250
We're already short on staff.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.750
Would you use our budget
to create this random team...

24:26.750 --> 24:28.420
if you were them?
Come on.

24:28.420 --> 24:31.690
"Hey, you rascal! Go catch
another criminal if you have time,"

24:31.690 --> 24:34.100
"you foolish kid."
Wouldn't they say that?

24:34.100 --> 24:38.100
I'm telling you. We need that team
in order to catch one more criminal.

24:38.130 --> 24:40.770
Those who've been here for too long
don't speak my language.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.760
Goodness, you didn't know?

24:42.900 --> 24:45.500
The men who have a say in this,
the ones who stayed for too long,

24:45.740 --> 24:49.200
hate unfamiliar methods
many times more than bad methods.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.310
So you should give up on your dream.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.740
A dream is meant to be had.

24:55.380 --> 24:57.920
Hey, Superintendent Baek.
Hey.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.890
Goodness, what's going on?

24:59.890 --> 25:02.160
Is he still going on and on
about the scientific investigation?

25:02.160 --> 25:03.160
Tell me about it.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.490
We're all busy,
but this guy must be free.

25:05.490 --> 25:06.890
Gil Pyo, will you be like this?

25:07.330 --> 25:09.660
My dear Chief Kook Young Soo of Forensics,

25:09.660 --> 25:10.930
stop talking to me.

25:10.930 --> 25:13.660
You can talk directly
to Superintendent Baek Jun Sik.

25:13.830 --> 25:15.570
Talk to me about what?

25:15.570 --> 25:18.140
My goodness.
Good grief.

25:30.850 --> 25:33.090
Do you know
how important profilers are?

25:34.990 --> 25:37.060
Yes, I do. Pro fliers, like pilots?

25:37.060 --> 25:39.430
If we want to conduct
scientific investigations,

25:39.430 --> 25:41.400
do we have to get on a plane too?

25:42.600 --> 25:44.260
The higher the building goes,

25:44.700 --> 25:46.490
the longer its shadow will be.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.040
Goodness, that quote is...

25:48.040 --> 25:50.340
from that ancient show, "Chief Inspector."

25:50.440 --> 25:53.740
I guess Young Soo is
getting older too.

25:53.740 --> 25:56.710
With the IMF crisis and all,
the buildings have crashed down.

25:56.710 --> 25:58.450
What shadow?

25:58.450 --> 25:59.780
You must be free.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.820
Listen up.

26:05.090 --> 26:06.750
Very soon, we will see...

26:06.750 --> 26:09.510
brutal and heinous criminals
like the ones in the US.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.730
These criminals have no motives.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.090
Then what do we do?

26:13.330 --> 26:15.760
We have to get ready
to deal with criminals like them!

26:15.760 --> 26:16.920
Hey!

26:17.100 --> 26:19.300
I can't take this anymore.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.960
Are you praying
that something big will break out?

26:22.070 --> 26:24.940
Why don't you go somewhere and pray
that a huge case will break out,

26:24.940 --> 26:27.210
then another, then another one
even bigger than the rest?

26:27.210 --> 26:28.730
That's not what I meant.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.440
You know what I mean.
Don't say that.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.280
How long did Park work overtime?

26:39.950 --> 26:41.210
Young Soo.

26:41.990 --> 26:43.410
Let's grab one later.

26:48.430 --> 26:49.560
I'm sorry.

26:51.900 --> 26:53.400
She was pregnant.

26:54.770 --> 26:57.460
Pregnant?
Yes, about 14 weeks.

26:57.740 --> 27:00.410
Man, this jerk.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.210
She died from suffocation
caused by pressure on the neck.

27:03.210 --> 27:05.150
Her nose and mouth were shut.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.810
The estimated time of death is...

27:06.810 --> 27:09.520
between 10 p.m. to midnight
on the night of 15.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.650
The temperature
of her rectum shows...

27:11.650 --> 27:13.490
that it was around 10:30 p.m.

27:13.490 --> 27:15.390
The contents of her stomach show...

27:15.390 --> 27:17.790
she ate something
within an hour before her death,

27:17.990 --> 27:19.630
so around 11 p.m.

27:19.630 --> 27:21.750
Other than the victim's mother,

27:23.560 --> 27:24.730
the time of her death...

27:24.730 --> 27:26.970
coincides with the time
of Bang Ki Hoon's visit.

27:26.970 --> 27:28.660
But there's no sign of rape.

27:28.670 --> 27:30.900
Wait, what about her clothes?

27:31.010 --> 27:33.870
There's no sign of rape,
but he only undressed her?

27:34.210 --> 27:35.730
It's 100 percent Bang Ki Hoon.

27:37.910 --> 27:39.610
So Bang Ki Hoon is your friend?

27:43.350 --> 27:45.240
We only went
to the same high school.

27:49.860 --> 27:52.090
(Temporarily closed
due to personal matters)

27:55.630 --> 27:56.860
Mr. Bang Ki Hoon?

27:58.330 --> 28:00.260
We're from Dongbu Police Station.
Come with us.

28:00.730 --> 28:02.000
Why should I?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.690
Are you acquainted
with Choi Hwa Yeon?

28:05.140 --> 28:07.340
She's my girlfriend.
Exactly.

28:08.780 --> 28:09.880
Bang Ki Hoon, you are arrested...

28:09.880 --> 28:11.850
for the suspicion
of Choi Hwa Yeon's murder.

28:13.350 --> 28:14.620
Murder?

28:15.650 --> 28:17.150
Murder? What do you mean?

28:18.690 --> 28:19.940
Murder?

28:20.190 --> 28:21.680
Is Hwa Yeon dead?

28:22.560 --> 28:24.920
We can talk about the details
at the station.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.420
You were going to run away?

28:28.700 --> 28:29.830
Too bad.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.170
You missed your window
by a close call.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.630
I'm not running away.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.640
Do you have an arrest warrant?

28:38.270 --> 28:40.710
Bang Ki Hoon.
You have the right to remain silent.

28:40.710 --> 28:42.180
Anything you say can
and will be used...

28:42.180 --> 28:44.410
against you in a court of law.

28:44.410 --> 28:47.150
You have the right to an attorney.

28:48.650 --> 28:49.940
Hwa Yeon is dead?

28:55.660 --> 28:56.950
I didn't do it.

28:57.220 --> 28:59.220
Yes. Right on cue.

29:00.130 --> 29:02.360
That's what everyone says.

29:02.360 --> 29:05.270
I really didn't do it.
Why would I...

29:05.270 --> 29:08.540
All the circumstantial evidence
is pointing to you.

29:09.170 --> 29:13.340
You were at her house
at the estimated time of death.

29:13.340 --> 29:15.970
And we also found
your fingerprints at her house.

29:16.140 --> 29:18.910
Why would I kill my girlfriend?

29:18.910 --> 29:22.120
Exactly. That's what
I would like to know too.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.550
Why did you kill your girlfriend?

29:24.550 --> 29:26.120
I didn't kill her.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.210
Then...

29:28.620 --> 29:31.330
where did you go
after leaving her house?

29:31.390 --> 29:32.720
You didn't work that night.

29:36.560 --> 29:39.720
You don't have anyone
to support your alibi, right?

29:40.670 --> 29:41.990
I went to the Han River.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.370
Come on.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.400
At least make it sound believable.
Is that the best you can do?

29:48.480 --> 29:49.580
I'm telling the truth.

29:50.540 --> 29:53.440
We had a fight that night.
I wasn't in the mood to work.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.010
That's it.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.820
Your motive
for killing Choi Hwa Yeon.

29:58.820 --> 29:59.980
It was...

30:01.490 --> 30:03.180
a small fight.

30:04.430 --> 30:07.260
Do you kill your girlfriend
over some argument you had?

30:07.260 --> 30:11.370
That's the difference between us.
So you sit there, and I sit here.

30:11.600 --> 30:15.230
We're only 1m apart. But there's
a huge gap between our humanity.

30:17.100 --> 30:18.200
Detective.

30:19.310 --> 30:20.960
I really didn't do it.

30:22.340 --> 30:23.470
Are you...

30:23.980 --> 30:25.580
the culprit
of the Red Cap Incident too?

30:28.020 --> 30:29.020
What?

30:29.020 --> 30:33.320
We got a report that someone saw
a man in a red cap around that time.

30:37.390 --> 30:41.950
(Turtle Supermarket)

30:44.770 --> 30:47.760
A man without an umbrella
was walking, not running.

30:47.970 --> 30:50.730
I just thought that it was
because he was wearing a cap.

30:51.370 --> 30:53.370
Was it red?

30:53.740 --> 30:55.400
I think it was.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.380
A red hat?
Yes.

30:57.380 --> 30:59.380
Do you remember
any other physical traits about him?

30:59.810 --> 31:02.280
As for his height...

31:02.280 --> 31:05.120
(Turtle Supermarket)

31:06.420 --> 31:10.150
I'm not sure. Anyway,
he was short enough to be a girl.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.330
Detective.

31:13.590 --> 31:16.030
What can I do
to make you believe me?

31:16.030 --> 31:19.030
Show me evidence you didn't do it.
Then I'll believe you.

31:19.030 --> 31:20.930
We only believe in evidence.

31:20.930 --> 31:22.840
But you don't have evidence. Do you?

31:24.040 --> 31:25.200
The door.

31:27.210 --> 31:28.970
The door wasn't locked.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.400
Think carefully before you speak.

31:32.750 --> 31:35.010
This statement could work against you.

31:41.390 --> 31:42.710
No.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.730
You have a record for assault.

31:48.730 --> 31:51.220
Gosh. You're running a business,
pretending to have left the gang.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.870
I'm not pretending.
I'm done with that life.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.660
I don't care
if this is an act or not.

31:57.170 --> 32:00.610
But people like you
get hot-tempered just like now.

32:01.110 --> 32:03.510
And when you do, unintentionally,

32:03.510 --> 32:05.650
you end up hurting people. Right?

32:06.080 --> 32:07.280
Just be honest.

32:08.020 --> 32:09.780
I don't kill people.

32:10.980 --> 32:13.790
Are you a gang member
who has a heart?

32:16.690 --> 32:19.160
Did your dead girlfriend know...

32:19.160 --> 32:21.030
that you used to be in a gang?

32:26.170 --> 32:28.040
Then did you know?

32:29.370 --> 32:32.140
That Choi Hwa Yeon was pregnant?

32:35.880 --> 32:37.840
What do you mean?

32:38.710 --> 32:40.080
Given that you were dating,

32:40.080 --> 32:43.050
you two kept a lot of secrets
from each other.

32:43.180 --> 32:44.850
Exactly.

32:45.290 --> 32:49.490
I'm telling you. You just can't rely
only on the physical evidence.

32:49.490 --> 32:53.630
Well, without the evidence,
we'd be shooting blind. Right.

32:54.090 --> 32:55.630
Then...

32:55.860 --> 32:57.860
what should we rely on?

33:00.300 --> 33:03.300
How they prepared to commit crimes.

33:03.340 --> 33:06.610
And how and why
they committed crimes.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.940
And how the corpses were handled.

33:08.940 --> 33:13.080
We should be studying
the entire process.

33:13.080 --> 33:16.480
Right. And scientifically too.
Yes.

33:16.480 --> 33:17.620
Science.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.050
Come on. Stop talking about science.

33:20.190 --> 33:21.790
Hold on.

33:21.790 --> 33:25.790
Do you have to get the license to be
a pilot or whatever that's called?

33:28.560 --> 33:31.100
What? Why are you laughing?

33:31.470 --> 33:33.470
Are you Choi Bool Am? "Pilot?"

33:33.470 --> 33:36.430
Gosh. You're so frustrating.
You're frustrating.

33:36.770 --> 33:39.310
It's not a pilot. It's a profiler.

33:39.310 --> 33:41.730
Right. A profiler...
Hey.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.910
A profiler.

33:43.910 --> 33:45.880
All right.
I'm sorry about the noise.

33:45.880 --> 33:49.780
By the way, who's going to do that?

33:49.920 --> 33:51.050
I know just the guy.

33:51.820 --> 33:53.940
He's more stubborn than me.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.650
Gosh. He sounds like trouble.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.670
(Temporarily closed
due to personal matters)

34:24.120 --> 34:26.909
Bang Ki Hoon. Did you really do it?

34:41.070 --> 34:43.139
Gosh. I can't believe this.

34:45.179 --> 34:48.380
There were a lot of petty thieves
in that neighborhood.

34:48.409 --> 34:51.520
The landlord on the second floor
was robbed of their valuables too.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.219
When?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.090
About a month ago.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.260
Their house had a smart door lock.

35:00.260 --> 35:01.890
When did you check that?

35:05.230 --> 35:07.130
Wait. Are you going there?

35:07.930 --> 35:10.500
Gosh. You really shouldn't.

35:10.570 --> 35:13.170
You killed a woman. You jerk.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.780
You jerk.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.610
I told you to confess, you jerk.

35:21.350 --> 35:22.620
What?

35:23.220 --> 35:24.580
What are you doing?

35:24.580 --> 35:27.350
I'm getting a confession out of him.
Close the door.

35:28.190 --> 35:30.220
You piece of trash.

35:30.590 --> 35:31.790
You jerk.

35:34.990 --> 35:38.230
What? What's the problem?
What is it?

35:38.230 --> 35:40.630
Do you think this confession
will be admissible in court?

35:40.630 --> 35:44.400
Respect me as your superior.
Don't you try to lecture me.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.040
Get back to work.

35:46.340 --> 35:47.840
This is my work too.

35:54.180 --> 35:57.620
Gosh. Come on.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.760
Get out.

36:08.590 --> 36:12.170
He can't even give me
his alibi right now.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.870
Why? Because he killed her.

36:14.870 --> 36:17.200
You know he was there
at the estimated time of death.

36:19.370 --> 36:21.270
Your little friend from school...

36:21.270 --> 36:23.710
had a fight
with Choi Hwa Yeon that day.

36:24.140 --> 36:27.480
He didn't call her for a few days,
so he had no idea she was dead.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.050
You think that makes any sense?

36:29.050 --> 36:30.850
She was pregnant.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.690
Bang Ki Hoon might not
have been the culprit.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.820
You think murderers have mercy?

36:36.190 --> 36:37.420
No.

36:38.420 --> 36:39.860
But it was too bad for him...

36:40.630 --> 36:43.060
because he didn't even know
she was pregnant.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.330
Hey.

36:44.330 --> 36:48.400
She must have hidden the fact
that she was pregnant for a reason.

36:48.670 --> 36:52.010
Well, even if I wanted
to be lenient with him, I can't.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.910
Even his motive is crystal clear.

36:55.510 --> 36:58.580
Anyway, these gangsters
will never learn.

36:58.710 --> 37:00.650
They get hot-tempered
and cause trouble.

37:00.650 --> 37:02.520
They are too dumb
to stage a perfect crime,

37:02.520 --> 37:04.220
but they don't want to serve time.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.490
But you still want
to believe that guy?

37:06.750 --> 37:08.290
This isn't about
if we believe him or not.

37:08.290 --> 37:10.520
I just want to find
definitive evidence.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.790
You said you weren't
really friends with him.

37:14.090 --> 37:15.560
Then listen up.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.530
Those jerks don't deserve
to be called human.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.600
And beating those scumbags...

37:22.600 --> 37:24.740
is the fastest and the easiest way
to teach them a lesson.

37:25.940 --> 37:27.470
I understand, but this is wrong.

37:28.840 --> 37:29.980
(Interview Room)

37:32.550 --> 37:35.680
I know why you got kicked out
of Jungbu Police Station,

37:36.820 --> 37:38.820
but don't try
to police your supervisors...

37:38.820 --> 37:41.020
by nitpicking us.

37:41.950 --> 37:43.960
Just get out there
and catch criminals.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.630
Just go out there.

37:45.630 --> 37:46.990
You have a lot of work to do.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.830
(Let's create a free,
mature democratic society.)

38:09.020 --> 38:10.150
Hey.

38:10.820 --> 38:13.820
Investigate him in connection
with the Red Cap case.

38:13.820 --> 38:14.950
Yes, sir.

38:14.990 --> 38:17.720
But he didn't rape her.
And the method is different.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.630
Such perverted acts
are no different from rape.

38:28.270 --> 38:30.400
Wait, where are you going?

38:30.940 --> 38:32.240
I'm heading out to find evidence.

38:34.340 --> 38:36.740
My goodness.

39:00.270 --> 39:02.130
This might prove
that it wasn't Bang Ki Hoon.

39:02.740 --> 39:06.110
There are signs of forced entry.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.440
Here's another thing.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.310
Choi Hwa Yeon was pregnant.

39:11.010 --> 39:12.710
Then did you know?

39:13.210 --> 39:15.250
That Choi Hwa Yeon was pregnant?

39:16.120 --> 39:18.450
But he didn't know,
and he denied all charges.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.390
There is evidence against him.
Number one.

39:26.060 --> 39:28.330
His prints and blood
were found at the scene.

39:28.590 --> 39:30.500
Number two.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.370
The estimated time of death
also matches.

39:32.770 --> 39:33.970
That punk...

39:34.700 --> 39:36.800
Your little friend from school...

39:37.140 --> 39:39.140
had a fight
with Choi Hwa Yeon that day.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.440
Clear motive.

39:42.710 --> 39:43.780
Number three.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.440
Show me evidence you didn't do it.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.080
Then I'll believe you.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.910
He has no alibi.

39:57.460 --> 39:58.520
Number four.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.560
Entered through the door
instead of the windows.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.070
I should really move.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.830
Petty thieves are one thing,
but someone died.

40:08.900 --> 40:10.970
Gosh, I'm so terrified
that I can't live here anymore.

40:11.140 --> 40:12.370
Even I'm this scared.

40:12.370 --> 40:14.240
What if the house doesn't sell?
I'm worried.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.540
Who else had break-ins in this area?

40:16.610 --> 40:19.780
There were 3 to 4 other cases,
just counting the ones I heard of.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.510
You see, that's the problem.

40:21.510 --> 40:23.120
The stolen goods
aren't that valuable,

40:23.120 --> 40:24.520
so the police don't care.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.890
It's been so long.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.790
If it was a rich family,
the thief would be in jail already.

40:28.790 --> 40:30.260
Was there
another break-in downstairs...

40:30.260 --> 40:31.590
before this incident?

40:31.590 --> 40:34.460
No, not that I know of.

40:34.590 --> 40:36.430
Okay, thank you for your cooperation.

40:36.430 --> 40:37.730
Detective.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.000
Can you also catch the thief
who stole my jewelry...

40:40.000 --> 40:42.940
while tracking down the jerk
who killed the lady downstairs?

40:42.940 --> 40:44.840
Okay. Just a moment, please.

40:50.940 --> 40:54.510
Ma'am, these numbers here.
Did you write them?

40:55.980 --> 40:57.350
What is that?

40:57.350 --> 41:01.220
My goodness. Why would I doodle
on the wall? I'm not a kid.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.960
Maybe my granddaughters wrote them
when they were visiting?

41:08.290 --> 41:09.530
Anyway, thank you.

41:09.900 --> 41:13.430
Detective, please catch that thief!

41:14.770 --> 41:16.070
(Case Report)

41:16.740 --> 41:17.900
(Case File)

41:18.740 --> 41:21.040
Five cases were reported in total.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.540
There was a break-in every 2 weeks
up until 3 months ago.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.610
The last one was the 2-story house
at 214 Daebong-dong?

41:26.610 --> 41:29.020
Yes, this jerk is clever.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.750
He never breaks into houses
where men live.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.250
And the value
of the stolen items is low.

41:33.890 --> 41:36.960
It's so petty that there are
no leads on him whatsoever.

41:37.290 --> 41:39.260
So Dongbu Police Station
has given up.

41:39.690 --> 41:42.230
We've enhanced patrols in the area.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.200
And thankfully,
it's been quiet since then.

41:44.830 --> 41:46.130
Okay, thank you.

41:46.300 --> 41:50.600
(Daebong Substation)

41:58.780 --> 42:00.950
Daebong-dong, 183-10.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.650
The number, 233.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.790
Hey! Who are you?

42:10.790 --> 42:12.390
What are you doing?
Hold on!

42:12.390 --> 42:14.090
Ma'am!
Why are you lurking around?

42:14.090 --> 42:16.530
I'm a police officer!
Why? What?

42:16.830 --> 42:18.060
I'm a police officer, ma'am.

42:19.330 --> 42:21.970
Then why didn't you ring the doorbell?

42:22.170 --> 42:24.740
Why did you lurk around my house?
It looked so suspicious.

42:24.740 --> 42:27.570
My gosh.
I'm sorry. It's getting late.

42:27.940 --> 42:29.410
What can I do for you?

42:29.480 --> 42:31.380
I have a few questions.

42:31.640 --> 42:32.850
What is it?

42:33.350 --> 42:36.120
Do you happen to know
what these numbers are for?

42:36.220 --> 42:38.280
That's not my address.

42:38.750 --> 42:40.090
What is it?

42:40.150 --> 42:42.290
Mom.
Yes?

42:42.860 --> 42:44.520
Why did you come out?

42:46.890 --> 42:48.530
Who's in your family?

42:48.530 --> 42:50.930
Me and my kids. Just the three of us.

42:51.330 --> 42:53.130
I don't mean to pry,
but what about your husband?

42:53.300 --> 42:54.430
Why do you ask?

42:54.670 --> 42:56.470
I'm interviewing every household
in the area.

42:57.970 --> 42:59.670
We don't live together.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.640
I see, I'm sorry.

43:02.780 --> 43:05.410
You don't think
your kids wrote the numbers, right?

43:05.410 --> 43:07.710
They're not tall enough
to reach that high.

43:07.710 --> 43:08.850
I see.

43:10.150 --> 43:11.750
Thank you for your cooperation.

43:12.250 --> 43:14.750
Sure. Come on. Let's go back inside.

43:14.750 --> 43:16.360
Bye, Mr. Policeman.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.020
Hurry, go inside.
Bye, kiddo.

43:18.020 --> 43:19.690
What's wrong with this area?
I'm sorry again.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.770
Daebong-dong, 190-3.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.170
The number, 22.

43:31.170 --> 43:33.170
Who do you live with?

43:33.170 --> 43:35.340
Just me and my sibling. Why do you ask?

43:35.340 --> 43:37.840
Your sibling? Sister or brother?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.480
Sister.

43:39.580 --> 43:41.110
Who do you live with?

43:41.110 --> 43:42.620
I live alone.

43:43.580 --> 43:45.350
Who do you live with?

43:45.450 --> 43:47.590
My mom. It's just the two of us.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.200

I see a number written on the wall.

44:01.830 --> 44:03.840
Who do you live with?

44:03.840 --> 44:06.170
I live with my wife.
What's this about?

44:07.470 --> 44:09.070
Who is it?
Hello.

44:09.070 --> 44:12.210

had 233 written on the wall.

44:22.520 --> 44:25.090
The house with 2 kids
also had 233 written on the wall.

44:25.220 --> 44:27.090
These numbers seem random.

44:27.090 --> 44:28.560
What could they mean?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.500
Gosh, that punk...

44:43.640 --> 44:45.740
Maybe my granddaughters wrote them
when they were visiting?

44:46.580 --> 44:48.910
Me and my kids. Just the three of us.

44:52.820 --> 44:55.550
(Do your duty.)

44:55.550 --> 44:57.260
How many eateries in the area
deliver?

44:57.260 --> 44:59.220
Like Chinese restaurants
and fried chicken joints.

44:59.490 --> 45:01.990
Which places deliver?
See these numbers?

45:03.160 --> 45:04.200
What is this?

45:04.200 --> 45:05.730
It shows you
who lives in each household.

45:05.730 --> 45:07.070
Two means an adult female.
Three means a kid.

45:07.070 --> 45:08.300
And the number one...

45:09.540 --> 45:10.940
means an adult male.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.510
That was the number he avoided,
the houses where men live.

45:13.510 --> 45:15.740
He deliberately broke into houses
where only women or kids live.

45:15.740 --> 45:18.380
But what does that have to do
with restaurants that deliver?

45:18.380 --> 45:20.150
It has to be someone
with a job that allows him...

45:21.150 --> 45:23.050
to have an idea
of who lives in each household.

45:29.490 --> 45:32.660
The serial rapist
known as "Red Cap"...

45:32.660 --> 45:36.160
whom women living in Seoul
have been terrified of...

45:36.160 --> 45:38.730
was arrested last night.

45:38.730 --> 45:40.030
You're heading out already?

45:40.230 --> 45:41.470
Yes.
Dongbu Police Station...

45:41.470 --> 45:44.100
Gosh, isn't that your district...
The police managed...

45:44.100 --> 45:47.210
to arrest the suspect at the scene.

45:47.610 --> 45:50.080
The suspect was caught red-handed,

45:50.080 --> 45:51.880
wearing his red cap.

45:51.880 --> 45:54.380
He has admitted to all charges
and confessed that he is...

45:54.380 --> 45:56.180
the real culprit
in the Red Cap serial murder case.

45:56.180 --> 45:57.480
Do you admit to everything?

45:57.480 --> 45:58.750
Move back.
Just a comment, please.

45:58.750 --> 46:00.650
Is there anything you'd like to say
to the bereaved?

46:00.650 --> 46:01.790
Just a comment!
Move back!

46:01.790 --> 46:03.960
Look here!
Say something!

46:03.960 --> 46:06.190
Why did you do it?
How do you feel now?

46:06.190 --> 46:07.360
Just a comment!
Wait!

46:07.930 --> 46:10.060
Do you admit to all charges?

46:10.060 --> 46:11.660
Wait!
Just a comment!

46:11.700 --> 46:14.230
Unlike the previous cases...

46:14.230 --> 46:16.940
that took place
in the victims' homes,

46:17.070 --> 46:18.740
this incident...
How dare you smirk?

46:18.740 --> 46:20.470
took place...
Is this fun for you?

46:21.370 --> 46:22.470
Request an arrest warrant.

46:22.470 --> 46:23.640
Yes, sir.

46:23.810 --> 46:25.980

46:27.410 --> 46:29.820
Sit down.
That jerk.

46:30.750 --> 46:32.250
Song Ha Young, right?

46:34.420 --> 46:36.320
The culprit picked the lock to break in.

46:36.320 --> 46:37.690
Look, these numbers...

46:37.690 --> 46:39.460
Your friend has already confessed
to everything.

46:43.460 --> 46:46.700
Goodness. Should I go
to a temple somewhere and pray?

46:46.700 --> 46:49.030
Talk about bad timing.

46:51.500 --> 46:53.340
How could you kill
your own girlfriend?

46:53.340 --> 46:56.440
It really wasn't me.
Please believe me.

46:56.740 --> 47:01.650
Hey, I've seen plenty of scumbags
who killed their wives, daughters,

47:01.650 --> 47:04.120
and even their own parents
on the spur of the moment.

47:04.120 --> 47:05.850
A girlfriend? That's nothing.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.550
Goodness, me and my bad luck.

47:09.520 --> 47:11.390

47:11.390 --> 47:14.190
but that punk is getting
all the spotlight now.

47:15.030 --> 47:19.000
They only care
because she was pregnant.

47:19.160 --> 47:21.370
Why did he take her clothes off?

47:21.570 --> 47:23.200
I guess he's a perverted punk.

47:23.900 --> 47:26.240
You expect me to know
his sexual preferences too?

47:26.240 --> 47:29.740
If you're that curious,
just ask his friend over there.

47:33.550 --> 47:35.410
That guy isn't the culprit.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.680
Get up and follow me.

47:40.290 --> 47:41.990
Are you taking him
to the Special Crime Squad?

47:42.050 --> 47:44.620
Why would he go there?
We're the ones who caught this punk.

His eyes weren't that of
a criminal's eyes though.

Please...

49:02.840 --> 49:05.700
Do everything you can
to catch the guy...

49:06.670 --> 49:08.440
who killed my Hwa Yeon.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.180
Bang Ki Hoon, the man who was
Choi Hwa Yeon's boyfriend...

49:14.980 --> 49:16.850
he's the culprit.

49:18.580 --> 49:20.450
Did you say, "boyfriend?"

49:20.990 --> 49:24.320
Hwa Yeon had a boyfriend?

49:25.520 --> 49:29.360
She hid her pregnancy and even
the fact that she had a boyfriend.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.760
Is Bang Ki Hoon really
the culprit then?

49:34.030 --> 49:35.770
Oh, goodness.

49:37.840 --> 49:39.300
Of all the things to take after me,

49:39.300 --> 49:42.940
it had to be my bad luck with men.

49:52.580 --> 49:56.490
I'm so sorry, Hwa Yeon.

49:57.690 --> 50:00.290
I'm sorry, Hwa Yeon.

50:06.060 --> 50:09.470
I should have
stayed with her that day.

50:11.370 --> 50:13.470
She asked me to sleep over.

50:14.810 --> 50:18.310
She offered but I declined.

50:26.950 --> 50:29.120
It's not your fault.

50:29.590 --> 50:32.590
I should have died
instead of Hwa Yeon.

You're here.
Yes.

52:03.750 --> 52:04.880
Here, take this.

52:08.090 --> 52:09.190
Gosh.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.230
Where is it?

52:21.400 --> 52:23.840
They may have missed something
in the first investigation.

52:23.870 --> 52:25.440
Only this cup is left.

52:25.870 --> 52:29.310

why would he have left just this?

From his fingerprints, bloodstain,
and time of death.

52:34.650 --> 52:36.180
He even confessed.

52:36.550 --> 52:37.620
That's true, but...

52:37.620 --> 52:40.590
You just got to Dongbu Station,
will you be all right?

52:42.620 --> 52:44.920
I came because you asked as a favor,

52:44.990 --> 52:47.790
but just as a case is important,
relationships are important too...

52:47.790 --> 52:51.230
You're right. But right now,
it's more important to catch the culprit.

52:51.230 --> 52:53.200
You never give in to anything.

52:55.430 --> 52:57.270
I heard you were friends
with the suspect?

52:59.040 --> 53:00.370
Did you run
a background check on me?

53:00.440 --> 53:03.540
"Background check," you say?
I call it, "having interest."

53:04.110 --> 53:05.880
We're basically strangers.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.510
Even if he were my friend,
nothing would change.

53:07.510 --> 53:10.620
As I told you earlier...
All right, I got it.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.990
You're enough human interaction
that I need.

53:13.990 --> 53:17.360
That's why I couldn't refuse,
you know that, right?

53:18.120 --> 53:19.320
Thank you.

53:19.320 --> 53:20.790
Express it a little for me then.

53:21.490 --> 53:24.530
Here?
No, forget it.

53:26.200 --> 53:30.440
The fact he was calm enough to erase
his footprints and fingerprints...

53:30.440 --> 53:32.470
makes it highly likely
that this was a planned crime.

53:34.440 --> 53:36.540
A woman living alone
in a one-bedroom like this...

53:38.310 --> 53:40.380
He may have been hiding
and waiting for her.

53:43.950 --> 53:45.850
Either from underneath this bed...

53:49.390 --> 53:50.560
or behind here.

54:20.850 --> 54:22.450
Hey! Are you crazy?

54:24.420 --> 54:26.090
Gosh, darn it.

54:27.560 --> 54:31.530
Why did you ask for fingerprints
on a case that's done? Why?

54:31.930 --> 54:34.370
You said that Bang Ki Hoon
isn't your friend.

54:34.930 --> 54:36.200
It's not because he's my friend.

54:36.200 --> 54:40.140
Friend or not. This case is over.

54:40.140 --> 54:42.770
Bang Ki Hoon admitted to it!

54:45.380 --> 54:47.210
That's because you forced
a confession out of him...

54:47.210 --> 54:49.650
You're a complete lunatic,
aren't you?

54:49.880 --> 54:53.150
Is Bang Ki Hoon stupid? Why would he
say he killed her when he didn't?

54:53.150 --> 54:55.150
He took back what he said though.

54:55.150 --> 54:58.390
Darn it, you crazy lunatic!

55:01.560 --> 55:04.460
Is it your hobby
to screw your superiors over?

55:05.430 --> 55:06.600
What's the problem?

55:06.600 --> 55:09.030
I'm just saying, Bang Ki Hoon
may not be the culprit.

55:09.030 --> 55:10.200
If he's not...

55:11.100 --> 55:13.570
if Bang Ki Hoon isn't the culprit.

55:14.270 --> 55:16.010
What are you going to do about it?

55:17.340 --> 55:19.410
If that becomes the case,
we'll have a bigger problem.

55:26.790 --> 55:28.390
Step outside for a moment, please!

55:28.390 --> 55:29.920

(Detective Division)

55:41.670 --> 55:44.070
Yes?
Inspector, Song Ha Young?

55:44.140 --> 55:47.370
I'm calling to notify you that
the fingerprint results are in.

55:48.070 --> 55:50.440
But we were unable
to confirm the identity.

55:56.780 --> 55:58.980
I understand the frustration...

55:59.520 --> 56:01.950
but you have to accept the outcome.

56:02.150 --> 56:03.620
Hi.
Yes, hi.

56:05.460 --> 56:08.590
My instincts
are telling me otherwise.

56:08.730 --> 56:11.460
I know we can't take
a detective's instincts lightly.

56:12.430 --> 56:15.030
But we have definite evidence
and his confession too.

56:15.030 --> 56:16.270
That's true, but...

56:17.400 --> 56:19.600
The fact that Choi Hwa Yeon's
wallet disappeared...

56:20.010 --> 56:22.070
how she was left undressed,

56:22.070 --> 56:23.740
and the trace of breaking in.

56:23.910 --> 56:26.210
On top of that, the number that
seemed marked by the culprit.

56:26.340 --> 56:28.310
All those things are bothering me.

56:29.380 --> 56:31.320
If it were a premeditated crime...

56:31.580 --> 56:34.020
why did he leave her undressed?

56:35.320 --> 56:37.390
He would've been busy
trying to cover up his traces.

56:38.020 --> 56:41.430
Have you heard about profilers?

56:42.190 --> 56:45.460
We call them
criminal behavioral analysts.

56:45.860 --> 56:47.900
All the qualifications
that a profiler needs,

56:48.930 --> 56:50.200
you have them all.

56:51.670 --> 56:54.070
First, refusing to give up
just like you are now.

56:54.070 --> 56:56.310
All detectives are...
Next is having an open mind.

56:56.410 --> 56:59.810
Intuition, general knowledge,
and the skill to analyze logically.

56:59.810 --> 57:02.210
You also need to be able to detach
personal feelings and other things.

57:02.210 --> 57:03.680
But more important than all that...

57:04.050 --> 57:07.750
The thing I find most important is
sensitivity.

57:07.890 --> 57:09.090
"Sensitivity?"

57:09.150 --> 57:12.390
Would you understand better if I say
it's sensitivity towards others?

57:12.620 --> 57:14.430
Why would you need that?

57:15.660 --> 57:18.230
Because it's a job
that analyzes people's hearts.

57:19.660 --> 57:22.370
Goodness. You only say
the most confusing stuff.

57:23.200 --> 57:25.100
Hey, take this.

57:27.070 --> 57:28.640
Give it a read when you have time.

57:29.370 --> 57:30.940
And these.

57:31.380 --> 57:33.010
Have some when you have time.

57:34.510 --> 57:37.880
Thank you. What is this?

57:37.950 --> 57:41.150
I'm making an attempt
to create a new team.

57:41.520 --> 57:43.050
I think I found the right guy...

57:43.860 --> 57:45.690
as a criminal behavioral analyst.

57:46.090 --> 57:49.360
It's a perfect job
for someone like you.

57:49.460 --> 57:50.900
I'm fine with what I do now.

57:52.600 --> 57:54.930
Hey, if you turn me down
before you even consider it,

57:54.930 --> 57:56.170
you'll hurt my feelings.

57:59.400 --> 58:00.640
Anyway, the thing is,

58:01.370 --> 58:03.710
it's tough to tell
what you're thinking,

58:04.280 --> 58:05.940
but that's a strength for a profiler.

58:06.880 --> 58:07.980
Are you teasing me?

58:07.980 --> 58:10.280
No, I'm very serious.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.280
You don't have to decide right away.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.550
It'll take some time anyway.

58:17.120 --> 58:20.330
But for now,
just remember that there is...

58:20.890 --> 58:22.490
something like this.

58:30.570 --> 58:32.340
Where are you going
after making her faint?

58:32.340 --> 58:34.200
What did you do
after you made her faint?

58:34.220 --> 58:35.280
(Suspect)

58:35.280 --> 58:37.450
Yes, you got on top of her.

58:37.990 --> 58:39.320
You got on top of her
and strangled her, right?

58:39.320 --> 58:40.680
How did you strangle her?

58:41.560 --> 58:42.760
Her neck.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.180
It was her neck, right?

58:46.730 --> 58:49.390
Man, this guy is driving me insane.

58:50.200 --> 58:52.490
Hey, your hands weren't like that.

58:53.030 --> 58:57.530
You pushed your hands
up to her chin and strangled her.

58:57.670 --> 58:59.910
Start pressing.

59:00.140 --> 59:02.780
You did this,
so why don't you remember?

59:03.640 --> 59:04.780
Continue.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.310
We're running out of time. Hurry up.

59:08.650 --> 59:10.120
Keep taking the video.

59:11.950 --> 59:14.520
After you strangled her, what's next?

59:14.520 --> 59:16.490
And then what?
You unbuttoned her shirt.

59:17.690 --> 59:19.220
Take her clothes off.

59:20.560 --> 59:22.300
Why did you kill your girlfriend?

59:22.300 --> 59:24.930
Tell us the motive of your murder!

59:24.930 --> 59:27.740
Move aside.
Say something!

59:27.740 --> 59:30.340
Please move.
Why did you kill her?

59:30.340 --> 59:32.160
What's your motive?
Murderer!

59:32.310 --> 59:34.280
Why did you kill her?
What's the reason?

59:34.280 --> 59:35.780
Say something!
Why did you do it?

59:35.780 --> 59:37.970
You murderer!
Why did you kill her?

59:41.150 --> 59:42.620
Please move aside!

59:42.980 --> 59:44.850
No!
Please move!

59:44.850 --> 59:46.680
No!

59:47.260 --> 59:49.280
Bring my daughter back!

59:50.760 --> 59:54.100
The victim lost her irreplaceable
and precious life...

59:54.300 --> 59:56.220
at such a young age,

59:56.830 --> 01:00:00.470
and it is clear the victim's family
will live in pain...

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:04.160
for the rest of her life,
along with a psychological shock.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.910
The crime of taking
another person's life is...

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:11.310
serious and unacceptable...

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:14.420
and the accused
did not reflect on his crime...

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.910
despite his history of assault.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.150
The judiciary concluded
that his crime was heinous.

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:20.220
(Daebong-dong Murder Case, Judgment)

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.180
Hence, the court sentences
Bang Ki Hoon, the accused,

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.560
to 12 years in prison.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.060
(Investigation Record, Case closed)

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:42.310
(Investigation Record, Case closed)

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.240
(We do not take bribes to alter
the investigation in any way.)

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:00.230
Pak Se Ri did not give up
in the midst of her crisis...

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.900
and showed her concentration
until the end.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:05.400
North Korea test-fired
a new ballistic missile today.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.700
Today at 5:40 p.m,
with the sound of a foghorn,

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.870
a historic departure was made
for Mount Geumgang...

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:12.440
The European Union's
unified currency was launched...

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.440
to unite the 300 million Europeans
into one economic bloc,

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.010
named the Euro.

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:17.680
Park Chan Ho, a pitcher in the MLB...

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.350
hit a two-base hit
worth two points and more,

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:22.220
playing as a pitcher and a batter,

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.090
scoring his second victory
of the season.

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:26.650
Shin Chang Won was finally caught.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.360
Shin Chang Won, the man
behind the escape of the century,

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.690
came to an end this afternoon
thanks to a civilian's report.

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:34.700
Let's hear the report
on Shin Chang Won's arrest...

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.560
from Reporter Choi Yong Beom.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.930
Believe in Christ, go to heaven.
Disbelief will send you to hell.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:45.510
Believe in Christ,
and you shall go to heaven.

01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:47.870
If you do not, you'll be sent to hell.

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:48.980
Believe in Christ, go to heaven.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.080
Disbelief will send you to hell.
The police...

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.450
I'm back.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:53.850
You brought it back?

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.480
Goodness, you didn't have to.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.870
It was right around the corner.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.550
Good work, Kang Moo. You should go home.

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:00.990
Thank you, sir.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.790
Good work today.
Good work.

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:04.130
Take good care of your grandma.

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.160
Okay. Goodbye.
Goodbye.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:10.030
He's very diligent,
unlike other kids these days.

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.830
I hope my son can be
half a man like Kang Moo.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.940
Teens these days are all like your kid.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.640
He's the odd one out.

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:23.100
Whenever he gets paid,
he takes it to his grandmother.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.950
There's no kid like him these days.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.080
Does he think he's my dad or what?

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.720
(Sungwon Restaurant)

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.680
Dal Sik.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.990
Why didn't you tell me about Dae Hyub?

01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:57.100
(Through the Darkness)

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:32.620
Ha Young, what did you do
with your friends today?

01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:38.100
This lady looks sad.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.600
Yes.
Why is she sad?

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:53.420
Do you know how scary it is
when you're deep underwater?

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.860
(Supermarket)

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:58.450
She must've been scared and sad.

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.030
Her mom isn't there in the water.

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:08.430
Ha Young, come here.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:15.470
It's not that Ha Young is
unable to feel anything.

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:18.050
He can feel them way too deeply.

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.280
I'm not sure if you'll understand him.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.970
But he can look deeply
into people's inner side.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:25.550
Their inner side?

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.060
Ha Young. What about your umbrella?

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.780
I gave you an umbrella this morning.

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.620
Where is it?

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:37.660
Ha Young is only nine years old.

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:39.530
It's because he's a child.

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:43.160
He sees a gap between his feelings
and other people's reactions.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:50.640
He must have realized that
he is different from the others.

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.700
Seeing the dead body that day...

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.640
triggered this thought in his head.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:01.410
So he's trying to hide his emotions.

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:03.010
Don't worry, Ha Young.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.280
I will bury it in a nice place.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.260
Come here.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.680
I want to know
why you thought he didn't do it.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.280
If you fail to catch him again,
things will get worse.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.450
Detective Song of Dongbu Police Station...

01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:33.490
went to Yang Yong Chul,
an inmate in prison,

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:36.090
and received help from the inmate.
And this news shocked the public.

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:39.130
A detective kept visiting him...

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.760
and asking him for advice.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.560
Criminals understand each other better.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.860
It's about the Behavioral Analysis Team.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.170
I think we can finally set it up.

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:47.840
Other people might not understand
why we need this, but you know...

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.970
that we need this.

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:51.830
And I am certain that you are
the perfect man for the job.
