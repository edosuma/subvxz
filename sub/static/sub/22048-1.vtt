00:01.240 --> 00:07.880
The global mentality is moving toward
free world trade and increased market liberalism.

00:08.820 --> 00:13.540
A world full of opportunities.
A world where dreams can come true.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.640
It sounds fantastic,
and it is fantastic.

00:18.940 --> 00:20.780
For a very small percentage of us.

00:21.680 --> 00:32.000
But for the vast, poor majority, the capitalist
system only means one thing: death and suffering.

00:32.560 --> 00:39.340
While we live out our days thoughtlessly,
and stuff ourselves with cheap food..

00:39.580 --> 00:43.260
.. the poor people of the earth struggle
in factories.

00:43.540 --> 00:47.720
Wages are forced down to the minimum,
while the work hours keep increasing.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.560
Unionization is illegal,
and the working conditions are intolerable.

00:51.560 --> 00:56.540
Before applauding freedom,
we must remember one thing:

00:56.540 --> 01:00.800
Our over consummating society stands
on the shoulders of the coffee beans from Peru.

01:00.840 --> 01:07.120
We gorge on cheap food produced
by underpaid children's hands from India-

01:10.660 --> 01:12.860
Was it good?
-So good!

01:13.120 --> 01:17.520
Should I change the title to:
Working conditions are inhumane?

01:17.780 --> 01:20.700
No, it was good the way it was.
-Yeah?

01:21.060 --> 01:24.580
Are there other things you thought of?

01:27.480 --> 01:31.500
You know you wrote
"gorge on cheap food" twice in a row?

01:31.740 --> 01:33.680
Maybe you could change that.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.540
No, that's the point.
To write it twice.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.960
I use repetition as a
literary tool to emphasize...

01:54.720 --> 01:56.940
Was it good?
-Yeah, that was good.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.440
Cleverly written.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.440
I got a 5.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.380
5+? Nice. Really good!

02:12.760 --> 02:14.140
Eva, what did you get?

02:15.140 --> 02:16.920
I don't want to talk about it.

02:16.980 --> 02:21.700
The thing is, is that Jonas is your boyfriend.
So you have to tell him everything,

02:21.880 --> 02:25.340
and Jonas tells me everything.
So I'll know anyway.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.240
It's true.

02:27.220 --> 02:29.900
Okay, yeah.
I got a 4 minus.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.340
You got a 4 minus?

02:34.020 --> 02:38.040
That's bad.
-Yeah, yeah. You're good a a lot of other things.

02:38.520 --> 02:44.620
You're able to dress yourself,
you can brush your teeth by yourself. Think of that.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.600
Jonas, we're leaving.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.740
Now?
-Yeah.

02:51.740 --> 02:53.740
Where are you going?
-To Elias.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.500
I'll call you later.
-Okay.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.780
<i>[Phone is turned off...]</i>

04:25.140 --> 04:26.440
Hello!
-Hey!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.920
What's up?
-Nothing special, really.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.320
Are you with Jonas?
-No, not now.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.240
Weren't you going to Elias?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.780
Yeah but that was a while ago.

04:38.580 --> 04:43.260
Did you see Sara's picture?
I think she got fake lashes.

04:43.620 --> 04:47.440
No!
-Yeah, check the picture on Facebook.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.980
Have you heard they
started their bus already?

04:53.240 --> 04:53.860
No.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.800
One month into high school
and they started their bus.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.240
With who?

04:59.120 --> 05:01.480
With Rodrigues maybe,
they're calling themselves Papsi Max.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.540
You know you can
just talk to her, right?

05:09.740 --> 05:10.800
She doesn't bite.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.560
Jonas is here.
I have to go.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.900
What are you gonna do?

05:30.860 --> 05:34.400
I tried to call you,
but you never answered your phone.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.820
My battery was dead.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.180
Can't you just charge it at home?
-I wasn't home.

05:41.220 --> 05:42.460
Where were you then?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.320
I was at Elias'.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.440
Until now?

05:46.620 --> 05:51.320
I talked to Isak. He said
you guys left Elias' a long time ago.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.480
So many questions!
Isak left, I stayed.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.280
Don't you trust me?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.860
Don't you trust me?

06:02.240 --> 06:03.200
Huh?

06:03.720 --> 06:05.420
Why don't you trust me?

06:11.420 --> 06:15.220
3+? You said you got a 4 minus!
-It's almost the same.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.540
"Whoever has expelled..."
-Jonas!

06:20.380 --> 06:25.400
"... must be blamed for their behavior."
-Jonas!

06:31.780 --> 06:34.880
"A state one experiences"?
That was really sweet.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.900
What do you think you're doing?
-A kiss.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.260
What's your name?
-Ingrid.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.740
Are you guys in the same class.
-1STA, yeah.

07:28.140 --> 07:30.120
It costs 10 Kroner per ticket.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.920
It'll be good.
Are you guys excited?

07:41.660 --> 07:42.560
Hi!

07:42.900 --> 07:44.560
Will you be at the show?

07:45.300 --> 07:48.840
We're from the theater
group, and we want to have you!

07:53.180 --> 07:55.340
What do you do at the theater group?

08:06.120 --> 08:09.260
We have a pre-party tomorrow.
Are you going to the party?

08:10.800 --> 08:13.060
You have to, everyone will go!

08:13.220 --> 08:18.980
You're a first year. This is when you'll
lay the foundation for your social future for the next three years!

08:19.120 --> 08:20.040
Wake up!

08:23.220 --> 08:26.780
But if you want to be at
the pre-party, add me on Facebook.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.020
Argentina etc.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.980
I don't think anyone actually likes him.

08:40.540 --> 08:45.040
When the teacher asks obvious questions...

08:45.380 --> 08:46.360
Hey you...

08:46.700 --> 08:48.260
Can't we go to the party?

08:48.380 --> 08:49.520
Why?

08:49.820 --> 08:55.000
Because the entire school is going.
And we are first years.

08:55.180 --> 08:58.580
This is when we have to
lay the foundation for our social life.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.800
Foundation for our social life?

09:02.660 --> 09:05.860
Come on! It'll be so much fun!

09:08.660 --> 09:12.040
I promise.
-Yeah okay, I'll come.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.880
If... Isak can come
to the cabin next week.

09:19.180 --> 09:25.120
I know it was supposed to be just the two of us,
but Isak has nothing to do.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.920
He'll just walk around,
completely by himself.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.740
You can take a friend as well.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.120
What do you say?

09:47.340 --> 09:50.040
Okay, Isak can come.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.160
Come to what?

09:51.520 --> 09:52.960
The cabin, man!

09:53.260 --> 09:55.520
Cabin? I'm going to the cabin?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.760
On one condition..

09:58.960 --> 10:01.020
That you guys come to the party tomorrow.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.340
We can't.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.100
Why not?

10:04.240 --> 10:06.000
Kindred Fever tickets.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.880
I completely forgot!

10:10.300 --> 10:13.620
Seriously, I didn't even remember it.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.220
Hi! You came!

14:28.520 --> 14:30.600
You can't ignore me forever.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.940
We're bound to talk.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.300
Ingrid...

14:45.320 --> 14:46.340
I miss you.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.560
Say something.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.320
I would've lost the eyeliner.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.840
You look like a slut.

14:58.840 --> 14:59.880
She snapped.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.040
NOORA

15:10.380 --> 15:13.040
We have Spanish together. Noora.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.580
Eva.

15:17.300 --> 15:23.720
Girls who call other girls sluts
have 90% higher chance of getting chlamydia.

15:24.300 --> 15:25.300
Seriously?

15:25.560 --> 15:26.200
No.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.020
But it would've
been cool if it were true.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.980
Are you okay, or?

16:22.180 --> 16:23.900
Yeah... Yeah.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.120
Are you sure?

16:37.560 --> 16:38.920
Maybe...

16:40.420 --> 16:42.720
Maybe I can get a friend?

16:47.280 --> 16:48.900
Can you maybe get Chris?

16:49.340 --> 16:50.380
Chris?

18:03.420 --> 18:06.920
It was 40.000 Kroner.
I don't have that money!

18:06.960 --> 18:09.740
It's toilet paper, Vilde! Toilet paper!

18:09.840 --> 18:11.540
It's not that bad.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.200
We're not going to use
that much toilet paper.

18:14.460 --> 18:19.280
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I got Chris for you.

18:19.780 --> 18:20.800
Here I am!

18:24.900 --> 18:26.840
This is Chris.
-I am Chris.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.300
Are you also called Chris?

18:31.580 --> 18:33.440
Oh my god!

18:33.580 --> 18:35.600
Twin names!
-Yeah, twin names!

18:50.320 --> 18:53.160
We were actually in
the middle of something...

18:54.260 --> 18:56.720
Yes, of course.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.620
Come, we're going.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.440
What happened?
We're not going to talk?

19:02.100 --> 19:03.540
You! Where are you going?

19:04.080 --> 19:06.180
Don't be a dick tease.
