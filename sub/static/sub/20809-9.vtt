WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.768
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Whoo!

00:02.770 --> 00:06.839
- Critics have called
"Drag Race" the best show on TV.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.440
- Yay!
- When I'm good, I'm good,

00:08.442 --> 00:12.344
but when I'm bad, I get
a serous venereal disease.

00:12.346 --> 00:16.382
- And this season,
the All Stars kept us gagging.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.551
You'll be eliminating...

00:19.553 --> 00:21.487
each other.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.056
- I fucked up this week, man.
I fucked up.

00:24.058 --> 00:27.226
- Party.
- I'm not holding shit back.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.427
Oh, at all.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.061
- And gagging.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.363
- If you thought it was
personal, absolutely not.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.631
- Can I be completely honest?

00:32.633 --> 00:36.835
I am sick of hearing them say
you can wear shit on stage,

00:36.837 --> 00:38.904
but it's okay
'cause you're Alyssa.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.406
- What?

00:40.408 --> 00:41.540
Oh, my God!

00:41.542 --> 00:42.741
- Oh, my fucking God.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.644
- What is going on here?

00:45.646 --> 00:46.645
- Oh.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.082
- And gagging for more.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.016
- Aah!

00:51.018 --> 00:51.984
- What the hell?

00:51.986 --> 00:55.154
- Tonight, the queens
have reunited to pop off.

00:55.156 --> 00:59.358
- If you want to say that
I'm fake, I have this to say.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.426
- And spill the T.

01:00.428 --> 01:03.929
- You think you're clever,
don't you, bitch?

01:03.931 --> 01:05.831
- Adore Delano.

01:05.833 --> 01:06.965
- I believe in free love.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.500
- You do?
- I do.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.435
- Alyssa Edwards.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.471
- Don't say I get a free pass
because I'm funny.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.539
- Coco Montresse.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.741
- It didn't sound like
there was any humility there.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.444
It was like,
I got that bitch.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.812
- Detox.

01:19.814 --> 01:20.679
- It's a pass, though.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.514
It's judged
a little differently.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.482
- Ginger Minj.

01:23.484 --> 01:26.018
- You do play a dirty game.

01:26.020 --> 01:26.919
- Katya.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.153
- No, the second part
was amazing.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.856
The first part
was utter bullshit.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.224
- Roxxxy Andrews.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.726
- You're going to regret this.
Don't do this.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.928
- Tatianna.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.130
- Oh, she pretty.
We've seen what she's got.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.299
- And she's a winner, baby.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.533
Alaska.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.336
- I did it.
I would do it again.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.739
- ¶ RuPaul's Drag Race ¶

01:47.741 --> 01:50.275
¶ Start your engines ¶

01:50.277 --> 01:51.410
¶ RuPaul's Drag Race ¶

01:51.412 --> 01:52.744
¶ May the best woman ¶

01:52.746 --> 01:55.547

01:56.617 --> 01:59.918
- Welcome to a good
old fashioned reunion,

01:59.920 --> 02:00.819
celebrating the queens

02:00.821 --> 02:04.823
of "RuPaul's Drag Race
All Stars 2."

02:04.825 --> 02:05.924
Welcome, ladies.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.559
- Hello.
- Yo.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.063
- And congratulations,
Alaska.

02:11.065 --> 02:16.235
(applause)

02:16.237 --> 02:20.372
Oh, and in case any of you are
questioning my qualifications

02:20.374 --> 02:24.810
towards tonight's reunion,
I have one thing to say.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.945
Talk to her.

02:26.947 --> 02:30.616
(cheers and applause)

02:30.618 --> 02:33.152
Now, it's fun
to snatch trophies,

02:33.154 --> 02:35.821
but the proudest achievement
of my career

02:35.823 --> 02:37.523
has been to provide
a platform

02:37.525 --> 02:38.891
that has launched
the careers

02:38.893 --> 02:42.828
of 100 queens
to international stardom.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.331
Now, what you decide to do
with that platform

02:46.333 --> 02:47.566
is up to you.

02:47.568 --> 02:51.003
And tonight, one queen
decided not to join us.

02:51.005 --> 02:54.940
Or as Tatianna would say,
choices.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.408
- (laughs)

02:56.410 --> 02:57.743
- One thing before we start.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.610
If at any point tonight

02:58.612 --> 03:02.080
you think one of your fellow
queens is not telling the T,

03:02.082 --> 03:05.784
feel free to raise
the paddle provided

03:05.786 --> 03:08.420
and call bullshit.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.688
- (laughs)

03:09.690 --> 03:12.157
- For example,
if one of you were to say,

03:12.159 --> 03:17.896
"I blame the edit,"
I'd say, bullshit.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.264
- (laughs)

03:19.266 --> 03:21.233
- See how it works?
Good.

03:21.235 --> 03:25.737
So first, let's start
with the All Star twist

03:25.739 --> 03:27.806
that changed everything.

03:27.808 --> 03:32.544
This season,
you'll be eliminating...

03:34.048 --> 03:36.548
Each other.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.521
- Okay.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.656
Welcome to "All Stars."

03:46.794 --> 03:50.295
- Now, when I revealed that
you'd be eliminating each other,

03:50.297 --> 03:51.730
what did you think?

03:51.732 --> 03:52.664
- Fuck
- (laughs)

03:52.666 --> 03:54.833
That's my first thought
was like, fuck.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.569
But you know, I think that
because it was "All Stars"

03:57.571 --> 03:59.738
and because
we're the best of the best,

03:59.740 --> 04:01.573
we should have expected
there was some kind of twist.

04:01.575 --> 04:05.310
- It was like
a mustard gas bomb went off.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.579
- I've heard of those.
- When it happened, yeah.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.481
I've had mustard gas before.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.250
- Oh, really?
On a hot dog?

04:11.252 --> 04:12.751
- Yeah, totally.
- (laughs)

04:12.753 --> 04:15.254
Now how did you guys
come up with this idea

04:15.256 --> 04:19.791
to base your eliminations
on what the judges said?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.727
- That was my way
of making sense of it.

04:21.729 --> 04:25.030
We were sitting there and we
were all like, this is terrible.

04:25.032 --> 04:25.864
I don't want to do it.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.933
And I was like, well,
we have to do it.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.101
We have to do something.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.802
- Right.
- So I wanted to do it

04:30.804 --> 04:34.473
as though I was sitting
in your position

04:34.475 --> 04:35.641
when you have to
send people home.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.576
- Right.
- Did we all agree to it?

04:37.578 --> 04:38.243
- No.
- No.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.645
- I would not have agreed
to that.

04:39.647 --> 04:40.912
That is setting
yourselves up

04:40.914 --> 04:42.914
for a fucking bitch fight,
low key.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.150
Like just watching.
- Which we did.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.818
Because we're stupid.
(laughs)

04:46.820 --> 04:48.120
- Watching the show,
it felt like you guys

04:48.122 --> 04:50.255
were trying
to defer the blame--

04:50.257 --> 04:51.456
- Back to the judges.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.059
- Back to the judges,
and not take responsibility

04:54.061 --> 04:56.295
for the decisions you made.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.796
Is that a fair statement?

04:57.798 --> 04:58.797
- Of course. Yes.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.831
- You throw me the potato,

04:59.833 --> 05:01.967
I'm throwing it back at you,
bitch.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.936
- And I think,
in retrospect, yes,

05:04.938 --> 05:06.371
it does
come across that way.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.105
But in that moment,

05:07.107 --> 05:10.942
it seemed that first day,
like, well, this is fair.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.978
- Right, as
the competition progresses,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.881
friendships and all that
shit comes into play,

05:15.883 --> 05:16.915
and it's tough.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.583
- Well, exactly.
- It's a mother fucker.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.019
- Because Alyssa was accused
of breaking the pact.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.354
Did you ever make the pact?

05:22.356 --> 05:24.356
- Baby,
nothing was notarized,

05:24.358 --> 05:26.425
no contracts were signed,

05:26.427 --> 05:28.994
my attorney was not present.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.996
That was hog wash.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.597
Let me get this gig.
Hold on.

05:32.599 --> 05:35.133
(all laugh)

05:37.171 --> 05:41.239
- Now, the first queen to get
the chop from a fellow All Star

05:41.241 --> 05:43.742
was the legendary
Ms. Coco Montresse.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.212
So, Coco, what was your
proudest moment on the show?

05:47.214 --> 05:51.116
- My proudest moment
was being there.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.919
I didn't want to come--

05:57.891 --> 06:01.860
Before I got the call from you
to come back to the "All Stars,"

06:01.862 --> 06:03.528
I had just gotten out
of the hospital.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.297
I was--
my lungs were failing,

06:05.299 --> 06:09.868
and I fought my way back
to being able to live.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.869
- Oh, my goodness.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.505
- And I didn't want anybody
to know that.

06:13.507 --> 06:17.109
I didn't want to get
any sympathy from anybody.

06:17.111 --> 06:21.580
I wanted to come back
and prove who I was.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.418
And...

06:26.420 --> 06:29.788
(sobs)

06:38.465 --> 06:41.166
I just don't want
to let the people down

06:41.168 --> 06:43.135
who believe in me.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.536
- Well, you haven't
let your fans down.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.338
You haven't
let yourself down.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.206
How are you doing now?

06:48.208 --> 06:50.842
- Much better, much better.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.644
I'm probably about 98%.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.780
I was traveling so much,
I wasn't eating,

06:54.782 --> 06:56.481
and I'm thinking,
oh, I'm invincible.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.917
I've never gotten sick
or anything like that.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.086
You've just got to take care
of yourself.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.321
- Yeah, you need to all
take care of yourselves.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.556
- Yeah, you have to.

07:04.558 --> 07:08.894
- Now, this is a question
from our "Drag Race" super fans.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.897
Do you think that your
elimination was fair?

07:11.899 --> 07:15.500
- The girl that I chose
was Coco.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.104
- And who do you think
should have gone home?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.071
- No, I don't.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.007
I don't think my elimination
was fair.

07:22.009 --> 07:26.878
This is "All Stars,"
and, no, I wasn't my best.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.313
I can be honest
and say that.

07:28.315 --> 07:28.947
It wasn't my best.

07:28.949 --> 07:33.084
But there was one person
in that bottom three

07:33.086 --> 07:34.419
that's not here,

07:34.421 --> 07:36.888
that didn't sing
that great that day,

07:36.890 --> 07:39.357
but that wasn't taken
into consideration.

07:39.359 --> 07:39.858
- Mm-hmm.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.828
- And that hurt me more
than anything in the world.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.430
- I know that
if I was in the top,

07:45.432 --> 07:48.934
I would not have sent you home
that first challenge.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.369
And if you roll back
the tapes,

07:51.371 --> 07:54.773
you can see
who I would have sent home.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.507
- Yeah.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.008
- 'Cause I don't think
she did the worst.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.512
And I would say that
if Phi Phi was here,

08:00.514 --> 08:05.617
and she's not here, but, yeah,
I don't think she did the worst.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.818
- I remember you
saying that.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.120
- Now, after you left,
you tweeted

08:09.122 --> 08:12.424
that some people sell out
their family and friends

08:12.426 --> 08:14.860
for fame
and a little fortune.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.862
Do you still feel that way
about Roxxxy?

08:16.864 --> 08:20.966
- Yes,
to a certain extent, I do.

08:20.968 --> 08:24.002
- Everybody has their right
to their own opinion to me,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.003
and whatever they feel.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.806
As far as the tweets go,
we all get mad,

08:27.808 --> 08:30.175
and we say things
that we don't want to say.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.710
There is a line,

08:31.712 --> 08:33.712
and I've crossed
that line before.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.881
I think a lot of people have
crossed that line before,

08:35.883 --> 08:37.616
and when you put something
out there,

08:37.618 --> 08:38.617
sometimes you want to say,
shit,

08:38.619 --> 08:40.218
I should have thought about
this twice before I did it.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.388
- And sometimes, maybe we
shouldn't say those things

08:43.390 --> 08:44.489
on social media.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.359
Maybe we should pick up the
phone and talk to each other.

08:47.361 --> 08:51.162
- So Roxxxy,
are you cool with Coco?

08:51.164 --> 08:52.197
- I will always be cool
with Coco.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.299
Girl, she could say
the nastiest thing to me,

08:54.301 --> 08:56.001
and the next day I'll be like,
girl, you still my sister,

08:56.003 --> 08:58.803
I love you, ain't nothing
ever going to change.

08:58.805 --> 09:01.540
- I still love you more
than anything in the world.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.675
You will never
lose a friend in me.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.645
- All right,
so we'll be right back.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.214
Coming up....

09:09.216 --> 09:11.383
- What are you feeling
right now?

09:11.385 --> 09:12.417
- Embarrassed.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.586
- You said that I played
a dirty game.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.488
- You do play a dirty game.

09:16.490 --> 09:17.789
- Yep.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.362
(RuPaul laughs)

09:26.900 --> 09:28.333
- Now, the Snatch Game
episode

09:28.335 --> 09:31.937
featured one of the most
shocking moments

09:31.939 --> 09:33.572
in "Drag Race" her-story.

09:33.574 --> 09:37.442
Why are your eyes all red?

09:37.444 --> 09:38.843
- Um...

09:38.845 --> 09:44.015
I didn't--I just didn't expect
it to be like this, I think.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.620
I'm thinking of going home.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.990
- Of tapping out?
- I think so.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.800
I'm sorry.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.274
- What are you feeling
right now?

10:11.912 --> 10:14.546
- Embarrassed.

10:15.415 --> 10:19.084
I just shouldn't--I just felt
like I shouldn't have done that.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.386
I didn't want
to let anybody down.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.856
Nobody goes on "All Stars 2"
and is, like, peacing out.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.592
Like, that's like, whack.
It's not even my style.

10:27.594 --> 10:31.396
Like, I walk and I see how
beautiful and statuesque,

10:31.398 --> 10:32.764
like, Detox and Roxxxy
looked,

10:32.766 --> 10:33.832
and I was just like fuck.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.133
My outfits
that I got made for me,

10:35.135 --> 10:36.668
like, don't even
stand up to this, man.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.103
And I didn't prepare myself

10:38.105 --> 10:40.772
to bring myself back to
the whole elimination process,

10:40.774 --> 10:43.174
the critiquing process,
the goddamn runway.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.643
And, like, I wasn't
mentally prepared

10:44.645 --> 10:46.044
to hear that
from Michelle, either.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.214
- Girl, this is
a 14th Street dress,

10:49.216 --> 10:50.448
like, that doesn't fit you.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.851
I don't care if you're going
to give me your hot body line

10:52.853 --> 10:54.252
or whatever it is.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.689
It's just
I expected more for you.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.390
Do you care?

10:58.392 --> 11:00.492
'Cause, like,
everything's like blasé.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.460
- We just got off tour together
around the world,

11:02.462 --> 11:03.928
so the aerodynamics
are completely changed,

11:03.930 --> 11:07.098
and you have to be brought back
to like, not Kiki home girl,

11:07.100 --> 11:08.633
like, you know,
roadie, homey,

11:08.635 --> 11:10.969
back to like, you know,
you're Michelle Visage,

11:10.971 --> 11:13.371
so you're going to tell me
what the fuck you think.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.106
You know, before, I could
just be like, girl, bye.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.307
I'm going to my
dressing room or whatever.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.910
But here, I have to sit there
and fucking take it,

11:18.912 --> 11:20.011
and I wasn't prepared
for that.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.880
I don't even think
I'm still prepared for that.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.982
- I just got to say,
as an All Star,

11:23.984 --> 11:27.118
you can't really wear something
off the rack.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.720
You have to wear something
that's special

11:28.722 --> 11:29.988
that other people can't get.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.256
That's really
what the meaning

11:31.258 --> 11:32.857
of being a superstar is,
you know?

11:32.859 --> 11:34.592
- Yeah.
- And if it is off the rack,

11:34.594 --> 11:38.129
it has to be altered in a way
that no one else can do it.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.064
- Got it.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.267
- And you know, having seen
your, sort of, melt down,

11:42.269 --> 11:43.201
I could totally relate.

11:43.203 --> 11:47.038
In January, I'll be
doing this for 35 years.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.639
- Jesus Christ.

11:47.641 --> 11:50.175
- And what happens
is you have to build up

11:50.177 --> 11:53.378
that dialogue with yourself
to sit yourself down,

11:53.380 --> 11:54.913
center yourself.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.147
Everything is cool.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.650
You're here
because you earned it.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.951
Don't get it twisted.

11:59.953 --> 12:03.555
You are
the cream of the crop.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.791
You are all All Stars.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.293
So one last question.

12:08.295 --> 12:12.864
Adore, "All Stars 3,"
are you in?

12:12.866 --> 12:14.566
- (laughs)

12:14.568 --> 12:18.436
(evil laugh)

12:19.806 --> 12:20.972
I have no idea.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.841
(all laugh)

12:22.843 --> 12:25.777
I'm probably down.
I'm probably down.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.979
- (laughs)

12:27.981 --> 12:29.114
Now, the next
shocking moment

12:29.116 --> 12:34.052
was after the Snatch Game
when Tatianna got the chop.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.654
- The queen
that I have chosen...

12:38.759 --> 12:40.692
Is Tatianna.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.627
- So, Tatianna,
do you feel Alaska

12:42.629 --> 12:46.965
based her decision to
send you home on the critiques?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.634
- Which time?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.836
(all laugh)
- Oh, damn!

12:51.838 --> 12:54.339
- The first time,
I think so, yeah.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.275
I did poorly
in the Snatch Game,

12:57.277 --> 12:59.110
and I wasn't the best
on the runway.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.245
The second time, no.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.615
I didn't really get
that negative of a critique,

13:03.617 --> 13:05.583
I didn't feel like.
Choices.

13:05.585 --> 13:06.451
And I think that my runway

13:06.453 --> 13:08.887
was one of the most
entertaining, and like, best.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.856
- Now, Alaska, tell me what
was going through your mind

13:11.858 --> 13:14.325
when you had to eliminate
a girl.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.260
- Well, it was really hard.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.495
- Were you thinking about
the audience looking at you

13:17.497 --> 13:19.631
or were you thinking about
your friendship with the girl?

13:19.633 --> 13:23.802
- If I was thinking about
the audience's reaction

13:23.804 --> 13:25.436
and if I knew what that was,

13:25.438 --> 13:28.907
then I would have probably
made different choices.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.708
- #Choices (laughs)

13:30.710 --> 13:33.211
- But I had no idea.
How could I know?

13:33.213 --> 13:33.812
I had no idea

13:33.814 --> 13:37.949
the way people would be so
galvanized behind Tatianna,

13:37.951 --> 13:40.952
and I'm so happy
that they have.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.987
And if you want to say
that I'm fake,

13:42.989 --> 13:46.858
if you want to say that I'm
a snake, I have this to say.

13:46.860 --> 13:50.595
The only thing fake about me
is this.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.397
- Yes!
- (laughs)

13:52.399 --> 13:55.300
- Oh, little Debbie
Scooter snack.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.869
- Scooter, bitch.
- Medic!

13:57.871 --> 14:02.173
(all laugh)

14:02.175 --> 14:04.576
- She is the queen.

14:04.578 --> 14:07.512
- All right.
(laughs)

14:07.514 --> 14:11.082
So, Ginger,
in coming to "All Stars,"

14:11.084 --> 14:13.284
did you accomplish
your mission?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.820
- Well, no,
because I didn't win.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.957
But I didn't feel
like myself.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.826
I didn't feel like
I could find my groove.

14:21.828 --> 14:25.230
I didn't feel like I knew
where to jump back in,

14:25.232 --> 14:29.801
because I felt like I was
still doing it from Season 7.

14:29.803 --> 14:32.904
And I also felt like
we were at maybe an advantage,

14:32.906 --> 14:34.806
but mostly a disadvantage--
- Disadvantage, girl.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.242
- Because we literally

14:37.244 --> 14:38.877
came right back
into that workroom.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.246
I had just lost.
- Uh-huh.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.314
- And so your mind just starts
playing tricks on you.

14:43.316 --> 14:47.352
- Do you feel that Alyssa broke
the pact when she sent you home?

14:47.354 --> 14:48.086
- Wait, hold on.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.355
Can we break the pact down?
What was the pact?

14:50.357 --> 14:52.457
- It was a blood oath...
(all laugh)

14:52.459 --> 14:56.227
Administered by the members
of Rolaskatox.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.463
- Rolaskatox formation.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.366
- Well, the pact was
that the eliminations

15:01.368 --> 15:03.034
would be based on
the judges' critiques.

15:03.036 --> 15:07.071
And do you feel that
she broke that pact?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.073
- If she had been a part
of that pact,

15:09.075 --> 15:11.209
then, yes,
she would have broken it.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.844
But she wasn't part
of that pact.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.913
- You said in your
sign off interview

15:14.915 --> 15:16.781
that I played a dirty game.

15:16.783 --> 15:17.548
- Yes.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.517
- You do play a dirty game.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.852
- She just won
the Snatch Game.

15:20.854 --> 15:21.586
She got one point.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.356
You were safe,
episode one, two points.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.126
You were in the middle
of the road both times.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.562
If I was being strategic,
I would have packed your ass.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.197
(all laugh)

15:33.199 --> 15:35.600
- All right, kids,
we'll be right back.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.769
- Coming up....

15:37.771 --> 15:39.604
- You have to also sit back
and say,

15:39.606 --> 15:41.439
well, yes,
because it's Alyssa,

15:41.441 --> 15:42.607
it's judged
a little differently.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.243
- Don't say I get a free pass
because I'm funny.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.345
- Utter bullshit.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.880
- Errr.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.551
(RuPaul laughs)

15:53.553 --> 15:56.955
- ¶ And beyond,
you'll always be a hero ¶

15:56.957 --> 15:59.457
- Let's talk
movie she-quels.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.627
Alaska kicked Alyssa
in the challenge.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.831
- ¶ Camp town ladies
sing this song ¶

16:06.833 --> 16:09.467
- ¶ Doo-dah, doo-dah ¶

16:09.469 --> 16:10.501
- Dead!
- Aah!

16:10.503 --> 16:14.372
- And then kicked her again
right out of the competition.

16:15.375 --> 16:20.178
- The queen I've selected
is Alyssa Edwards.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.147
(sobs)

16:24.551 --> 16:26.684
- Alyssa, what do you think

16:26.686 --> 16:29.554
was behind Alaska
giving you the chop?

16:29.556 --> 16:32.156
- (clicks tongue)

16:32.158 --> 16:34.659
(all laugh)

16:34.661 --> 16:35.393
Well, let me ask you.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.397
Do you feel that any of it
was strategy?

16:39.399 --> 16:40.565
- No.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.001
- Do you think you based it
on judges critiques?

16:43.003 --> 16:46.437
- Yes, and I was there
in the scene with you.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.939
(all laugh)

16:47.941 --> 16:50.041
Girl, I'll send you home
again right now.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.643
Does anyone have a lipstick
with Alyssa on it?

16:52.645 --> 16:54.612
I did it.
I would do it again.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.815
- You sent her home solely
based on the challenge.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.083
Is that what you're saying?

16:59.085 --> 17:00.852
- I felt like
she did the worst.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.522
I mean,
we barely got through it.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.990
We barely
got it all on tape,

17:05.992 --> 17:09.861
all the words from the pages
on the scene.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.597
So it was like, I was afraid

17:12.599 --> 17:14.966
are we even going to get
through this one time?

17:14.968 --> 17:17.902
Of course, watching
the episode at home,

17:17.904 --> 17:21.606
everyone in the bar is like,
yeah, she's hilarious.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.975
But it was not hilarious
there.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.676
It was serious.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.713
And then the camera dress, I
thought, that's not two in one.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.783
It was like, I'm holding
the camera dress,

17:31.785 --> 17:33.451
and now here's
the camera dress!

17:33.453 --> 17:36.220
- Well, wait, you didn't
have a two in one at all.

17:36.222 --> 17:36.754
- Um...

17:36.756 --> 17:39.791
- A funeral shroud,
cloud of black trash bags?

17:39.793 --> 17:40.892
- I thought it was lovely.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.427
- No, it was--
the second part was amazing.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.129
The first part
was utter bullshit.

17:45.131 --> 17:48.166
Bitch, utter bullshit.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.835
- Errr.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.603
- Alyssa,
some queens have said

17:52.605 --> 17:55.740
that the judges were easier
on you in the critiques

17:55.742 --> 17:56.774
than they were
on the other girls.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.643
- I totally disagree.
- There were several times

17:58.645 --> 18:01.179
that all the judges were like,
it works because it's Alyssa.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.447
It's the Alyssa-isms.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.848
And Alyssa-isms
is a pass, though.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.917
- You have to also sit back
and say, well, yes,

18:05.919 --> 18:10.221
because of my Alyssa-isms,
because of how infectious it is,

18:10.223 --> 18:11.989
it's judged
a little differently.

18:11.991 --> 18:15.460
- Girl, no T, you had one
suitcase it looked like.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.562
You had a bra and a panty
and a paint for the first one.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.264
You had a little strappy outfit
and paint for the second.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.366
And I couldn't do that.
Your body is flawless.

18:22.368 --> 18:23.134
- Right.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.136
- She's wearing combat boots
on the runway,

18:25.138 --> 18:26.471
and she's wearing
flip-flops.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.772
- Don't you come
for my flip-flops.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.173
- And jellies.
We all have our own drag.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.274
- Everybody
has their own drag.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.209
- Don't say--yeah, don't say

18:31.211 --> 18:32.810
I get a free pass
because I'm funny.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.779
- Well, Jeremy Scott
said you are fashion.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.615
- You know what? Coco Chanel
says take off two.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.051
Alyssa Edwards says add 22.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.053
- I love playing dress up.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.387
This is a drag show.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.423
This is
the ultimate All Star show.

18:45.425 --> 18:49.527
Girl, reach in that caboodle,
that's your shit.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.761
(all laugh)

18:50.763 --> 18:53.831
- On that point, Alyssa, I have
a fan question for you.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.535
On a scale of Gila monster
to beast,

18:57.537 --> 19:01.105
how well do you think you slayed
the runway this season?

19:01.107 --> 19:04.909
- I think
I was...a wildebeest.

19:04.911 --> 19:05.510
- Okay.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.012
- Because it was wild,
bitch, it was all out!

19:08.014 --> 19:12.316
- Right after Alyssa
was sent packing,

19:12.318 --> 19:13.684
the mirror cracked.

19:13.686 --> 19:17.889
- I am sick of hearing them say,
you can wear shit on stage,

19:17.891 --> 19:19.957
but it's okay,
'cause you're Alyssa.

19:19.959 --> 19:20.925
It was sloppy.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.895
It was like she kept saying,
like, you shouldn't send me home

19:23.897 --> 19:26.063
because I've only been
in the bottom once,

19:26.065 --> 19:27.131
and she was too concerned
about saying

19:27.133 --> 19:28.633
this is your second time
in the bottom.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.367
You should go home.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.369
It seemed to me
she was more concerned

19:31.371 --> 19:35.439
about throwing you two under
the bus during deliberations.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.110
- What?

19:39.112 --> 19:40.344
- Oh, my God!

19:40.346 --> 19:41.612
- Oh, fuck my God!

19:41.614 --> 19:43.614
- What is going on here?

19:43.616 --> 19:47.485
- Trust the duchess.
It ain't over just yet, baby.

19:48.888 --> 19:53.124
- Oh, my goodness, child,
that mirror had four faces.

19:53.126 --> 19:57.395
- Oh, God, it was the best
feeling in the world.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.130
- None of us knew
what was happening.

19:59.132 --> 20:01.532
We were just told get into drag
and stand here,

20:01.534 --> 20:06.003
and I felt a lot of pain,
because this one was pissed off

20:06.005 --> 20:09.840
and had her claws digging into
my arm for about 30 minutes

20:09.842 --> 20:10.908
while y'all were talking
in there.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.211
- Well, I was trying to fix
my hair and shit,

20:13.213 --> 20:15.079
and I was like, girl,
she's mad.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.048
- We were there...well,
we were behind the mirror

20:17.050 --> 20:18.149
for like an hour.

20:18.151 --> 20:18.983
- Jesus Christ.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.151
- But we heard everything.
- Everything.

20:20.153 --> 20:24.322
But when it literally turned
into that fresh wound,

20:24.324 --> 20:25.723
just salt all over it.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.192
That good organic sea salt.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.026
- Honestly, I was happy

20:29.028 --> 20:30.828
that I might have a chance
to come back.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.763
But then it was like
hearing everything in the room,

20:32.765 --> 20:35.066
it just sounded so dark,
and it was like--

20:35.068 --> 20:35.933
- Do I want to want this?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.134
- I want to be here
and I want to compete,

20:37.136 --> 20:39.737
but, girl, I don't--why you
got to be dark-sided, girl?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.005
I was already eliminated.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.573
- There was a lot
of aggression, for sure.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.042
- It didn't sound like
there was any humility there.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.979
It was more so, it was, like,
I got that bitch.

20:47.981 --> 20:48.779
- Right.
- You know?

20:48.781 --> 20:49.780
- So what was
your first thought

20:49.782 --> 20:52.483
when you saw these bitches
appear in the mirror?

20:52.485 --> 20:53.918
- I thought they looked
fucking sickening.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.754
They looked so correct,
but then I was, like,

20:56.756 --> 20:58.789
now what the fuck
are you going to do to me?

20:58.791 --> 21:00.358
- That was epic, though.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.261
That mirror scene,
y'all did that.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.197
You think you're clever,
don't you, bitch?

21:06.199 --> 21:08.099
(all laugh)

21:08.101 --> 21:11.168
- The fashion this season
had everybody,

21:11.170 --> 21:14.138
including the "New York Times,"
gagging.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.842
Now I want some
queen on queen critiques.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.511
When we love an outfit,
we toot it.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.481
And when we don't,
we boot it.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.382
Katya, top two.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.251
- Roxxxy Andrews final outfit,
stunning from head to toe.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.019
- Oh! Oh, my God.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.321
- Smashing wigs,
colostomy bags

21:30.323 --> 21:33.457
and toenails out of
every living room in America.

21:33.459 --> 21:37.161
- Every single thing that Roxxxy
Andrews wore down the runway.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.463
- Yes.
- It was incredible.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.631
- I couldn't pick just one.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.033
- I want to say
it's Phi Phi.

21:42.035 --> 21:44.101
- I was obsessed
with her futuristic look.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.237
- Honestly, Phi Phi's
future of drag look

21:46.239 --> 21:48.739
was probably
one of my favorite looks.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.241
I thought it was brilliant.

21:50.243 --> 21:51.642
- Top boot.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.044
- Ginger's space look.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.011
- Oh, yes.

21:54.013 --> 21:57.014
- Space ho and robot chicken.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.817
- My top two of the season
was the top four.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.552
Visually,
they're just super stunning.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.387
They looked like a bunch
of fairies up there.

22:03.389 --> 22:07.358
And then boot me, I look like
a fucking shiny sack up there.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.125
(laughs)

22:08.127 --> 22:11.696
- Alaska?
- Top two, definitely Detox.

22:11.698 --> 22:17.068
The latex red bellbottom
pantsuit thing.

22:17.070 --> 22:17.968
It was beautiful.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.571
it looked like
it was painted on your body.

22:20.573 --> 22:23.240
It haunts me forever.

22:23.242 --> 22:26.644
Top boot,
the fucking camera dress.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.012
So stupid.

22:28.014 --> 22:33.451
- Hey, you got--girl, you got
cockroaches on your dress.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.752
(all laugh)

22:34.754 --> 22:35.619
- They're my pets.

22:35.621 --> 22:39.357
- All right, stay right there,
we'll be right back.

22:41.227 --> 22:41.959
Coming up....

22:41.961 --> 22:43.894
- Tell me about the hug
that never happened.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.029
- It was, like,
oh, just chill out.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.065
- I just don't think that
she wanted to hug Alyssa.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.203
(RuPaul laughs)

22:53.005 --> 22:56.140
(RuPaul laughs)

22:57.643 --> 23:00.144
- Now, Alyssa Edwards
and Tatianna

23:00.146 --> 23:01.479
made All Star her-story

23:01.481 --> 23:06.317
when they both lip synced their
way back into the competition.

23:06.319 --> 23:08.853
When you strutted
onto the runway,

23:08.855 --> 23:11.122
we knew
we were in for something.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.823
- You can look into our eyes.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.625
We were fighting
to get back in.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.993
- Yeah, we were.

23:22.435 --> 23:27.938
- I was like, damn, I really
wanted this so bad.

23:27.940 --> 23:31.475
- Now, tell me about the hug
that never happened.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.147
- Bye, love you.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.551
Phi Phi, I tried to hug you,
though.

23:40.553 --> 23:44.655
- What was going through
your mind at that time, Alyssa?

23:44.657 --> 23:45.589
- I didn't vote Phi Phi

23:45.591 --> 23:48.559
because of anything
other than her behavior.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.428
It was starting to feed off
on everyone,

23:50.430 --> 23:52.196
and it was like, girl,
just chill out

23:52.198 --> 23:53.898
and take a deep breath
and laugh.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.399
So when I tried to hug him
at the end,

23:55.401 --> 23:57.902
I wanted to say, look,
you know what?

23:57.904 --> 24:00.271
We came, we saw,
we conquered.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.940
It's okay to be a little bitter
and a little disappointed.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.742
That's life
when you fall short.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.545
But always tell someone else,
good job and congrats.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.513
It's harder to be
the bigger person in life.

24:09.515 --> 24:12.917
- I just don't think that
she wanted to hug Alyssa.

24:12.919 --> 24:13.751
(laughs)

24:13.753 --> 24:16.153
Because she walked up,
dissed her,

24:16.155 --> 24:18.122
but then gave everyone else
a hug after her.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.791
So that's why
I don't necessarily believe

24:20.793 --> 24:21.859
that it was 'cause
she was going to cry.

24:21.861 --> 24:27.264
Um, also, she did not cry
after hugging everybody.

24:27.266 --> 24:31.802
- When I saw it, I was like, no!
Bitch, hug her!

24:31.804 --> 24:34.171
Like, you're going to regret
this is what I felt.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.306
- It was
an authentic moment.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.307
She was angry and pissed.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.641
Don't pretend to be
something you're not.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.844
If you want to recoil from
the hug, that's a moment.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.412
- But you already pretended
in the dress--in the workroom.

24:41.414 --> 24:44.482
- Right, but what you see
isn't always the truth.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.284
- Right. (laughs)

24:47.286 --> 24:49.153
- Now, the family makeovers
challenge

24:49.155 --> 24:51.655
may have been my all-time
favorite challenge.

24:51.657 --> 24:52.323
- Mine, too.

24:52.325 --> 24:55.793
- Now, Detox, how did
putting your sister into drag

24:55.795 --> 24:57.161
bring you closer together?

24:57.163 --> 25:00.798
- I mean, we're pretty
inseparable to begin with.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.701
Having her share that moment
and being here,

25:03.703 --> 25:05.536
and as being my rock
to begin with,

25:05.538 --> 25:07.671
and to be such a rock
during that challenge

25:07.673 --> 25:10.908
was one of the most
amazing experiences ever.

25:10.910 --> 25:11.442
- Yeah.

25:11.444 --> 25:13.444
- I will never forget it.
- What about you, Roxxxy?

25:13.446 --> 25:17.448
Now, that was your grandmother
who raised you as her child.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.416
- She's always wanted
to be in front of cameras,

25:19.418 --> 25:22.686
so this like
her shining glory, like--

25:22.688 --> 25:24.755
- Couldn't tell.
- You couldn't tell?

25:24.757 --> 25:27.191
- She's gorgeous.
- Thank you.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.528
- How, Alaska, did putting
your mom into drag

25:30.530 --> 25:32.296
affect your relationship
with her?

25:32.298 --> 25:35.933
- Well, I've always considered
my mom a drag queen anyway.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.368
And I have so many memories
of my mom,

25:37.370 --> 25:39.737
like, being in the bathroom
and getting ready

25:39.739 --> 25:41.872
and doing her, like,
face and her hair.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.142
So she knows what it's like
to be a drag queen.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.545
- And Katya, your mother
seemed like a real natural.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.547
When you put that--
- Upstaged me.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.015
- When she put
that lace front on--

25:51.017 --> 25:52.416
- Put that Marilyn on
and hit it.

25:52.418 --> 25:55.452
- Yeah. Has she changed
since that challenge?

25:55.454 --> 25:56.287
- I told her, you know,

25:56.289 --> 25:58.289
you could be recognized
on the street, mom,

25:58.291 --> 26:01.892
and she was like, oh, my God,
I didn't think of that.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.093
So I pray for her.

26:03.095 --> 26:03.761
- Yes, yes.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.895
Well, I got to say,
Alyssa Edwards,

26:04.897 --> 26:09.600
we've seen the crazy nut,
you know, tongue popping Alyssa,

26:09.602 --> 26:14.138
but to see you so human
and so vulnerable,

26:14.140 --> 26:17.675
it felt like Alyssa Edwards
came full circle.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.543
- Mom would have loved
to do this.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.079
She would have.
- Yeah.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.147
I'm glad we're together,

26:23.149 --> 26:26.450
because it's
a sensitive time for us.

26:26.452 --> 26:27.618
- (sobs) Well,
thank you for coming.

26:27.620 --> 26:31.255
The day that they closed
my mother's casket,

26:31.257 --> 26:33.857
I just shut down.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.629
- What was your takeaway
in being there?

26:38.631 --> 26:41.031
- When my mom died,
it was just like,

26:41.033 --> 26:42.900
I packed my suitcase
and I left.

26:42.902 --> 26:46.670
I did a show that night
of my mother's funeral,

26:46.672 --> 26:49.673
and I could tell that
I was running from something.

26:49.675 --> 26:52.309
When she came into the room, I
just, I didn't know what to say.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.777
I didn't know
if I should say I'm sorry.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.579
When I looked at
the hurt in her eyes,

26:55.581 --> 26:58.182
I knew that they lean
so much on me.

26:58.184 --> 27:01.919
You make time for a booking,
you make time for a family.

27:01.921 --> 27:05.022
Because they're
going to be the ones

27:05.024 --> 27:06.890
that are going to be there
for you.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.459
- Yeah.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.494
All right,
we've got a fan question.

27:10.496 --> 27:14.365
What is your freakiest
fan interaction?

27:14.367 --> 27:16.166
Adore,
I bet you've got some.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.168
- I sleep with
a lot of my fans, so--

27:18.170 --> 27:19.169
- You do?
- I do.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.071
- Uh-huh.
- I believe in free love.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.539
- Sure, why not?

27:22.541 --> 27:23.240
- Like, cuddle?

27:23.242 --> 27:24.808
- No, I sleep with my fans,
like full on.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.778
Like, if they're attractive,
yeah, like, I make babies.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.414
- Girl, if you can't fuck
your fans, who can you fuck?

27:30.416 --> 27:31.849
- Exactly.
No, I believe

27:31.851 --> 27:34.451
if you have an attraction,
like, why not?

27:34.453 --> 27:37.655
Nothing shocks me
with a fan.

27:37.657 --> 27:38.822
- What about
you girls back there?

27:38.824 --> 27:41.091
Have you had carnal knowledge
with the fans?

27:41.093 --> 27:43.794
- Um, no, I--

27:43.796 --> 27:46.030
- Oh, shut up, Tatianna.
You're a whore.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.799
- You know what? They might
be a fan of me after our--

27:48.801 --> 27:49.299
- Okay.

27:49.301 --> 27:53.303
- No, I had a dude lick my foot
in Chicago, though.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.438
- That counts.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.372
Now, Detox, have you had--

27:55.374 --> 27:58.075
- Oh, you know we've
had this conversation.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.376
- You've had relations
with the fans.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.613
- I've had very carnal relations
with very many a fan.

28:02.615 --> 28:03.180
- Uh-huh.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.082
- And I feel like some of us
have, like, shared--

28:05.084 --> 28:07.084
- We've shared fans.
- We've shared fans.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.552
- We've had--I've shared
Courtney's fans.

28:08.554 --> 28:09.720
- And I usually get
the pictures after.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.855
- There was one time
I was in my hotel room

28:11.857 --> 28:13.457
and there were like
these two boys in there,

28:13.459 --> 28:15.926
and I was like,
uh, go see Adore.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.061
She's just down the hall.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.862
- Oh, my God, I was scared.
I was like, no!

28:18.864 --> 28:20.164
I don't want--
- You did, though.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.298
- Yeah, I did, yeah.

28:21.300 --> 28:25.069
- We had fun, us girls.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.271
- We'll be right back.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.106
- Coming up...

28:29.108 --> 28:31.075
- It was heart wrenching,
sending you home,

28:31.077 --> 28:34.678
because I knew
that it was not right.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.346
- Do you hold a grudge?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.954
(RuPaul laughs)

28:45.424 --> 28:47.191
- Now, in the family
makeover challenge,

28:47.193 --> 28:50.127
we learned that
global warming is real.

28:50.129 --> 28:54.431
Let's take a look
at Alaska's meltdown.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.934
(all laugh)

28:56.936 --> 29:00.904
- I fucked up this week, man,
and it really sucks.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.207
It fucking
really fucking sucks,

29:03.209 --> 29:05.242
and I need to be
in the final four,

29:05.244 --> 29:10.013
and now I'm potentially
looking at I'm not going to be.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.549
I'll give you $10,000
if you let me stay.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.251
I'll transfer it to you
via PayPal,

29:14.253 --> 29:18.589
because I need to stay
in this competition.

29:20.726 --> 29:21.959
- What was going through
your mind

29:21.961 --> 29:23.393
when you saw Alaska do this?

29:23.395 --> 29:24.361
- I thought
it was ridiculous.

29:24.363 --> 29:28.098
For someone who to me
is so talented and brilliant

29:28.100 --> 29:29.900
at what they do
and is so together,

29:29.902 --> 29:34.004
to have one, to me,
small minor misstep

29:34.006 --> 29:36.573
affect them and shake them
so much,

29:36.575 --> 29:38.776
it was very alarming.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.078
- I thought
it was strategic.

29:41.080 --> 29:41.512
- Oh.

29:41.514 --> 29:42.780
- But it was fun
to watch her crumble.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.782
(all laugh)
- That's so rude.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.151
- I think for me,
I seen it differently.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.686
I seen someone that it
really meant a lot to them.

29:49.688 --> 29:52.589
And it was like, bitch,
I have hustled,

29:52.591 --> 29:54.024
I have worked,
I have fought,

29:54.026 --> 29:55.993
I have cried,
I've stood back up.

29:55.995 --> 29:56.794
And if you were judging,

29:56.796 --> 29:58.629
you probably would
have sent yourself home.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.097
- Yep.
- That's a good point.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.399
That's a very good--what
was going through your mind?

30:02.401 --> 30:05.502
- Going in to "All Stars 2,"

30:05.504 --> 30:09.173
I was, like,
I didn't want to do anything

30:09.175 --> 30:11.275
that could be perceived
as weakness,

30:11.277 --> 30:13.944
because I watched Season 5

30:13.946 --> 30:17.414
and I saw someone
who was really insecure

30:17.416 --> 30:19.316
and who let
that insecurity

30:19.318 --> 30:23.153
affect their performance
in the competition.

30:23.155 --> 30:27.858
And I didn't want there to be
a single frame of camera

30:27.860 --> 30:29.326
of me stumbling over a line

30:29.328 --> 30:30.828
or doing anything
they could play

30:30.830 --> 30:33.096
that bumbly
stupid music behind,

30:33.098 --> 30:34.898
the ¶ doo-doo-doo-doo ¶

30:34.900 --> 30:36.667
(all laugh)

30:36.669 --> 30:38.702
And, Detox, if you want
the $10,000,

30:38.704 --> 30:41.605
I'll send you
my PayPal later.

30:41.607 --> 30:44.641
Thank you
for not sending me home.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.511
- Now, Detox, in the family
makeover challenge,

30:47.513 --> 30:52.115
explain why you sent Alyssa home
over Alaska and Roxxxy.

30:52.117 --> 30:55.118
- There was no way that
I could have sent her home,

30:55.120 --> 30:57.187
because
she had been killing it,

30:57.189 --> 31:00.591
and when it came down to
choosing between these two,

31:00.593 --> 31:03.160
I knew that Roxxxy
should have gone.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.161
And I went to go get
that lipstick,

31:04.163 --> 31:06.563
and there was just something--
my stomach was turning.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.832
I know I'm making
the wrong decision,

31:08.834 --> 31:12.135
but it's a decision
I had to stand by.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.838
It was heart wrenching
sending you home,

31:14.840 --> 31:19.676
because I knew
that it was not right.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.145
- Do you hold a grudge?

31:22.147 --> 31:25.182
- No. Mm-mm.

31:25.184 --> 31:28.552
No, because I've learned
if you hold a grudge,

31:28.554 --> 31:31.455
it only eats away at your
success and your happiness.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.224
- Sure, yeah.
- I had to let go of that.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.027
- Now, one gorgeous
All Star queen

31:37.029 --> 31:40.631
taught us all some new
wig tricks this season.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.165
Let's take a look.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.902
- Thick and juicy is back,
bitches.

31:44.904 --> 31:49.606
Dear, what seems
to be going on?

31:49.608 --> 31:51.108
- Roxxxy, my dear...

31:51.110 --> 31:54.411
- (sighs)
- You are an All Star.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.980
- I'm walking away so proud.

31:56.982 --> 31:59.283
I got to show
who I truly was.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.719
- I will forever
be thick and juicy.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.221
Bye-bye.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.690
(all laugh)

32:06.692 --> 32:08.492
- So, Roxxxy,
you made it all the way

32:08.494 --> 32:11.395
to the final four
of "All Stars."

32:11.397 --> 32:12.496
How does that feel?

32:12.498 --> 32:14.698
- It felt bittersweet.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.166
I was in the bottom
so many times,

32:16.168 --> 32:20.671
I felt like, I shouldn't have--
I didn't earn my way there.

32:20.673 --> 32:23.140
And that's--
It's bittersweet.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.610
I was happy to be there
and to continue to compete,

32:26.612 --> 32:29.546
but I felt like...
like, I don't know,

32:29.548 --> 32:30.981
like I wasn't
supposed to be there.

32:30.983 --> 32:31.949
- I think
you should have won.

32:31.951 --> 32:35.619
Girl, you were in the bottom
six out of seven episodes,

32:35.621 --> 32:36.787
and you made it
to the finals.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.622
That's how "Big Brother
Survivor's" won.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.992
I think you should have been
in the final three.

32:41.994 --> 32:46.296
- Now, a lot of you girls were
in Roxxxy's original season.

32:46.298 --> 32:50.734
How well do you think
she did in this competition?

32:50.736 --> 32:51.301
- Burned it.

32:51.303 --> 32:56.306
You have such a respect for
the fucking art of what drag is,

32:56.308 --> 32:58.542
and every detail
is thought about.

32:58.544 --> 33:02.879
- I could just tell how
happy she was to be there,

33:02.881 --> 33:05.849
which was a nice departure
from the first time around.

33:05.851 --> 33:10.454
- Well, also this was a chance
for you to redeem yourself,

33:10.456 --> 33:12.990
and you absolutely did that.

33:12.992 --> 33:13.790
And let me say this.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.760
You know, you're not given
a redemption.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.862
It's something
that you earn.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.430
I just wanted
to clear that up

33:20.432 --> 33:23.700
for people who don't understand
how that works,

33:23.702 --> 33:25.769
and you earned it, Roxxxy.

33:25.771 --> 33:26.603
Con-drag-ulations.

33:26.605 --> 33:27.904
- Thank you.
- Right on.

33:27.906 --> 33:28.638
(applause)

33:28.640 --> 33:31.408
We'll be right back
after this.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.310
Did you pop a nail, girl?

33:33.312 --> 33:35.445
(laughs)

33:35.447 --> 33:36.146
Coming up...

33:36.148 --> 33:38.648
- Is there anything you'd change
about the season?

33:38.650 --> 33:41.118
- Oh, God,
that sounds ominous.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.953
- (laughs)

33:45.157 --> 33:48.158
(RuPaul laughs)

33:49.361 --> 33:52.462
- Now, when the time came
to crown our queen,

33:52.464 --> 33:56.733
these next two queens
came so close, it hurts.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.402
First, there was Detox.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.504
- ¶ D to the E to the T
to the O ¶

34:00.506 --> 34:02.839
¶ To the--hold it ¶
- Oh!

34:02.841 --> 34:03.507
- ¶ X ¶

34:03.509 --> 34:05.509
Everyone's favorite trash
talking transvestite.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.277
My tuck is right.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.746
I'm brilliant.
I'm beautiful.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.383
I've never felt more...dead?

34:13.385 --> 34:15.185
- It left us gagging.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.286
- Thank you very much.

34:16.288 --> 34:20.390
- Now, Detox, maybe more
than anyone else this season,

34:20.392 --> 34:25.028
your runway looks slayed,
officially.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.296
- Yes! (laughs)

34:26.298 --> 34:27.731
- What was
your proudest moment?

34:27.733 --> 34:28.698
- The entire thing.

34:28.700 --> 34:32.202
Like, I feel such,
like, validation.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.870
Season 5,
I was not in the game.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.572
I was, like, so not present,

34:35.574 --> 34:38.475
but still had that, like,
grandioso attitude,

34:38.477 --> 34:43.080
and coming back and still having
my signature grandioso attitude,

34:43.082 --> 34:43.713
but slaying it.

34:43.715 --> 34:46.283
- Why were you out of it
in your season?

34:46.285 --> 34:47.884
- My dad just found out
he had cancer

34:47.886 --> 34:48.785
right before I came to film,

34:48.787 --> 34:50.987
and he kind of encouraged me
to go ahead and do it,

34:50.989 --> 34:52.556
but the whole time
I was just thinking, like,

34:52.558 --> 34:53.256
I shouldn't be here.

34:53.258 --> 34:56.026
Even though, like, it was
something I wanted for so long.

34:56.028 --> 34:58.929
And it sucked, because it was
like, I was finally there,

34:58.931 --> 35:02.999
and like, not really being able
to perform to my best abilities.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.969
And to get back here
and to be able to share

35:05.971 --> 35:08.505
with people who I admire
and respect so much,

35:08.507 --> 35:11.007
I was like, yes, this is
what it should have been

35:11.009 --> 35:12.008
the first time around.

35:12.010 --> 35:15.045
- Give me your favorite
Detox moments. Anybody?

35:15.047 --> 35:17.013
- I think that last episode,

35:17.015 --> 35:19.182
there was just something
so angelic about all of them,

35:19.184 --> 35:20.917
but because I've known you
for so many years,

35:20.919 --> 35:22.986
it was just really
a big proud moment.

35:22.988 --> 35:25.689
Like, as a friend, just to see
how beautiful you looked.

35:25.691 --> 35:26.890
Oh, I'm like
getting emotional.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.492
I'm all super proud of you.
- Thank you.

35:28.494 --> 35:31.862
- Every moment of Detox's
is a wonderful moment.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.964
She's wonderful
inside and out.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.966
- And she's seen me
inside, too.

35:35.968 --> 35:36.733
- Oh, okay.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.336
Right on, right on,
- Shh, don't tell that.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.104
- All right, and now,

35:41.106 --> 35:45.308
the only high class
Russian whore, Katya.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.277
- My name's Katarina
Petrona Zamalawchickova,

35:47.279 --> 35:48.912
but you can call me Katya,

35:48.914 --> 35:50.280
(snorts)
I am bombarded

35:50.282 --> 35:52.782
by a cacophony
of demonic voices in my head

35:52.784 --> 35:55.919
telling me... (deep voice)
You're not good enough.

35:55.921 --> 35:56.653
Wow.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.821
I'm giving you 1980s

35:57.823 --> 36:00.724
disinterested Ellen Barkin
fantasy,

36:00.726 --> 36:02.492
and I feel...
(deep voice) amazing.

36:02.494 --> 36:07.197
I'm not going to panic
because I don't do that anymore.

36:07.199 --> 36:08.398
- (laughs)

36:08.400 --> 36:11.935
Katya, I'm so happy you were
able to embrace your confidence

36:11.937 --> 36:16.239
and spotlight your talents
in "All Stars."

36:16.241 --> 36:17.140
- Oh, me, too.

36:17.142 --> 36:18.808
You put me
through drag school.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.710
I was going to go
to grad school.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.012
Switch the D and the G.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.382
You have no idea how lucky
I am to be a part of it.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.117
I don't care about winning.
I never did.

36:27.119 --> 36:28.418
I want to be
a part of the family.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.586
- And you are.
- Yep.

36:29.588 --> 36:30.320
- And you are.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.322
Is there anything you'd change
about the season?

36:32.324 --> 36:33.990
- I would probably bring
some better clothes,

36:33.992 --> 36:36.927
but I'm on a style journey
that is still evolving, Ru.

36:36.929 --> 36:39.029
- Yeah.
- We were just plucked out of--

36:39.031 --> 36:40.263
I don't want to harp on it,

36:40.265 --> 36:41.364
but plucked
out of the season

36:41.366 --> 36:43.466
and thrown back
into the skillet.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.402
- Yeah.
- Still scabby.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.069
(laughs)

36:46.071 --> 36:48.104
- Now, I want to talk
about the power of Katya.

36:48.106 --> 36:50.140
- Oh, God,
that sounds ominous.

36:50.142 --> 36:52.742
- Ginger, tell me about
the power of Katya.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.845
- There's not a mean spirited
bone in her body.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.215
I'm convinced there's barely
any bones in her body,

36:58.217 --> 36:59.316
wit the things
she does with it.

36:59.318 --> 37:02.385
- Somebody put their bone
in my body. I'm so lonely.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.320
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

37:03.322 --> 37:06.156
- But she's just,
she's just wonderful

37:06.158 --> 37:07.624
and she is a star

37:07.626 --> 37:09.459
and she's just this
big ball of energy.

37:09.461 --> 37:13.230
- Alaska, you also have a left
from center point of view,

37:13.232 --> 37:14.731
Were there any things
that she did

37:14.733 --> 37:17.634
that you thought, mm,
I wish I would have done that.

37:17.636 --> 37:20.971
- Oh, no, I wouldn't have wanted
to do any of that.

37:20.973 --> 37:22.272
- (laughs)

37:22.274 --> 37:24.941
- She's really smart,

37:24.943 --> 37:26.409
possibly dangerous--
I'm not sure--

37:26.411 --> 37:28.411
and she can do
a fucking split.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.879
- Yeah.
- So fuck you.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.715
- You're a pig from hell.

37:31.717 --> 37:32.415
- Fuck you!

37:32.417 --> 37:34.017
They're going to edit that
in the commercial,

37:34.019 --> 37:36.686
and it will look like
I meant it.

37:36.688 --> 37:37.754
(all laugh)

37:37.756 --> 37:41.291
- Now, "Drag Race" is truly
the Olympics of drag,

37:41.293 --> 37:44.828
and this next queen
brought home the gold.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.830
- ¶ Who's that bitch
that on the top? ¶

37:46.832 --> 37:50.200
¶ Oh, wait, that's me,
hey, porkchop ¶

37:50.202 --> 37:51.101
Bam.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.335
(all laugh)

37:52.337 --> 37:55.138
Nobody can do Alaska
except Alaska.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.507
¶ I'm campy and classy
and cunty and mean ¶

37:57.509 --> 38:02.245
Why don't you come on up and
fuck me in the ass sometime?

38:02.247 --> 38:03.380
Aah!

38:03.382 --> 38:04.247
Totally.

38:04.249 --> 38:04.981
- I think you've done

38:04.983 --> 38:06.750
a pretty amazing job
this journey.

38:06.752 --> 38:10.420
You've come a long way since
auditioning for Season 1.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.358
- Con-drag-ulations, Alaska.

38:15.360 --> 38:15.959
- Thank you.

38:15.961 --> 38:19.763
- What does the future hold
for Alaska, hall of famer?

38:19.765 --> 38:23.733
- Well, I'm going to have a
giant picture in a hallway.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.702
- Uh-huh.
- I got a new hat.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.570
- Yes.
- I like it.

38:27.572 --> 38:28.838
- Yeah.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.374
- I just put out a new CD.

38:31.376 --> 38:32.942
- Yes.
- A new tape.

38:32.944 --> 38:36.046
- It's a new tape.
It's called "Pound Cake."

38:36.048 --> 38:36.646
- Exactly.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.648
- Now, as your first
official duty,

38:38.650 --> 38:42.085
I'd like your opinion
on an audition tape

38:42.087 --> 38:44.254
made by a young
up and coming queen

38:44.256 --> 38:46.122
just getting started
in drag.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.158
Let's take a look.
- Certainly.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.661
- Three words to describe
Alaska Thunderfuck

38:51.663 --> 38:53.630
Drug addicted whore,

38:53.632 --> 38:57.701
batshit crazy,
hot mess city.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.235
Because I have class,

38:59.237 --> 39:03.973
I have grace,
and I have sophistication.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.208
- Yes.
(applause)

39:05.210 --> 39:10.647
- I'd say put her on "Drag Race"
in five years.

39:10.649 --> 39:11.548
(all laugh)

39:11.550 --> 39:13.983
- Now, that was
the second audition.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.586
- Yeah.
- And then you sent in a third.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.154
- Uh-huh.
- And a fourth.

39:18.156 --> 39:21.057
- Uh-huh.
- (laughs) And a fifth.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.392
- Uh-huh.

39:22.394 --> 39:23.560
(all laugh)

39:23.562 --> 39:25.929
I'm going to send one
next year, too.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.764
(all laugh)

39:27.766 --> 39:29.866
- Now, all you other ladies,
you got to admit

39:29.868 --> 39:32.936
that Alaska
was stiff competition. Oh.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.170
- (imitating Mae West) Oh.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.706
- What are your favorite
Alaska moments?

39:36.708 --> 39:37.774
- Snatch Game, for sure.
- Yes.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.576
- I farted laughing so hard.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.711
- "Executive opulence,
anus-thing is possible."

39:41.713 --> 39:46.649
- It was always good, but it
became perfect in "All Stars."

39:46.651 --> 39:48.284
- Charismic beauty,
disturbing talent,

39:48.286 --> 39:49.352
I think you define that.

39:49.354 --> 39:51.020
- Alaska,
from the very beginning,

39:51.022 --> 39:54.190
I saw in you perseverance,
a sense of fun,

39:54.192 --> 39:55.658
a sense of intellect,

39:55.660 --> 39:58.595
a sense of being
a marketing genius,

39:58.597 --> 40:02.332
which is really
the future of drag.

40:02.334 --> 40:06.202
And I'm so happy
for your success.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.138
Very happy.
- Thank you.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.105
This is amazing.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.874
Everybody turned it up,
turned it out,

40:10.876 --> 40:14.377
and like, made this the best
season of "Drag Race" ever.

40:14.379 --> 40:15.645
- Yes, this was absolutely

40:15.647 --> 40:17.414
the best season
of "Drag Race" ever.

40:17.416 --> 40:21.151
And you all have been so
gracious to share your stories

40:21.153 --> 40:25.188
and your heartbreak
and your dignity.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.491
And I am so proud
of each of you.

40:28.493 --> 40:30.427
(applause)

40:30.429 --> 40:32.729
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

40:32.731 --> 40:35.465
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

40:35.467 --> 40:37.200
Can I get an amen
up in here?

40:37.202 --> 40:37.901
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.036
- All right,
now let the music play.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.438
- ¶ Throw your hands up ¶

40:41.440 --> 40:44.107
¶ Time to get down ¶

40:44.109 --> 40:45.742
¶ Throw your hand up ¶

40:45.744 --> 40:47.577
- Come on.

40:47.579 --> 40:51.848
- ¶ Time to get down,
down, down, down, down ¶

40:54.119 --> 40:56.986
- Oh, my gosh.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.555
(laughs)

40:58.557 --> 40:59.589
Mwah.

40:59.591 --> 41:03.092
- Chad, do you ever
get lonely in here?

41:03.094 --> 41:04.861
- Snap out of it.
