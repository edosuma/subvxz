09:52.008 --> 09:54.594
I am so sorry.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.077
Look, I-I-I was like,

10:19.202 --> 10:20.912
"I might get shrimp,"
and then she's like,

10:21.037 --> 10:22.747
"Oh, wild Alaskan salmon,
that's in."

10:22.872 --> 10:23.831
And then I said,

10:23.957 --> 10:25.833
"Well, maybe I shouldn't
get the shrimp.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.085
Maybe that's boring."
And then she said,

10:27.210 --> 10:29.212
"No, silly."

10:30.922 --> 10:32.840
She always called me "silly."

10:32.966 --> 10:34.842
Hey, hey, what's up, guys?

10:34.968 --> 10:35.927
I'm sorry I'm late.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.929
Uh, Wilshire was like
a parking lot.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.306
So, cut up to Beverly.
Okay, would you

10:39.431 --> 10:40.765
shut up about the traffic?

10:40.890 --> 10:41.849
I'm dying here, okay?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.186
Oh, I'm sorry, bro.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.272
Oh. Okay.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.149
I'm sorry.
Mm-hmm.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.693
So, uh, nice place
you got here, man.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.654
Yeah. Thanks.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.159
What's under this tarp?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.827
Nothing. Just don't...

11:00.952 --> 11:02.912
Just don't touch that,
all right?

11:03.037 --> 11:04.080
Hey, are you guys hungry?

11:04.205 --> 11:05.373
I think I got sandwich
stuff in the house.

11:05.499 --> 11:09.085
My mom made some kind of
cake if you want dessert.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.551
(sighing)
Okay, you know, screw dessert.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.512
Why don't we grab
a couple of six packs,

11:18.637 --> 11:20.930
head down to the beach,
take your mind off it, huh?

11:21.055 --> 11:22.140
I don't want to take
my mind off it, okay?

11:22.265 --> 11:23.308
I just want to figure it out

11:23.433 --> 11:24.476
because it doesn't
make any sense, I mean,

11:24.601 --> 11:28.146
I was at the restaurant
and I sat down

11:28.271 --> 11:30.857
and I was like,
"I might get the shrimp"

11:30.982 --> 11:32.359
and then she was like "Oh, yeah,

11:32.484 --> 11:33.985
"wild Alaskan salmon,
that's in."

11:34.110 --> 11:35.987
And then I said "Oh,
maybe shrimp's boring."

11:43.953 --> 11:46.039
(sighs)

11:56.049 --> 11:57.425
Ugh.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.444
(phone beeps)

12:22.534 --> 12:24.536
(giggling)

12:32.460 --> 12:35.380
Please tell me how you deal
with those brats all day long.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.048
Well, it's not easy.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.217
Especially now that caning
is politically incorrect.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.386
Naomi troubles?

12:41.511 --> 12:44.222
Can you disown a sibling?

12:44.347 --> 12:47.392
I know she drives you nuts,

12:47.517 --> 12:49.310
but it's just because
you guys are so close.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.730
(laughs)

12:51.854 --> 12:53.814
Well, come on, you know
you're all she's got.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.983
She's lucky to have
you taking care of her.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.528
Now, are you going
to be a gentleman

12:58.653 --> 13:01.072
and help me off
with these?

13:01.197 --> 13:04.200
I was considering it
but then I thought,

13:04.325 --> 13:06.745
"What if I helped her off
with everything but the boots?"

13:06.869 --> 13:09.914
And I gotta say,
it wasn't the worst image.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.334
Well, I mean, you don't
hear me complaining.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.336
(cell phone ringing)

13:15.462 --> 13:18.089
And with her signature,
impeccable timing.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.633
There's Naomi.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.510
Who has apparently changed
her name to "Eduardo."

13:22.636 --> 13:25.346
Oh, no.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.098
This is our time together.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.642
Besides, Eduardo's gotta learn

13:28.767 --> 13:31.060
that I'm not always
available to him.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.063
Hmm...

13:34.188 --> 13:36.232
What?

13:36.357 --> 13:37.984
You're upset.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.444
No, no. I love
being in the loop

13:39.569 --> 13:41.862
and, uh, hearing
your strategies
for juggling guys.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.448
It's a real aphrodisiac.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.907
Oh, please.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.618
You can't possibly be jealous.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.453
I mean, obviously,
we're dating other people.

13:48.578 --> 13:52.206
Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.835
Now, where were we?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.851
♪ ♪

14:14.437 --> 14:15.563
(sighing)
Hey.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.149
Hi, what's up?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.067
Nothing much.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.528
I was just thinking,
we haven't really

14:21.653 --> 14:23.655
hung out that much
since Teddy's boat party.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.449
And yet the world is still
spinning around somehow.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.075
Annie, look.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.370
I never meant to hurt you
with that sext.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.163
I mean, yeah, I showed it
to a couple of friends,

14:32.288 --> 14:34.499
and that was lame
and I'm really sorry.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.501
Really sorry.
Thanks.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.504
Well, come on, the real jerk
in this whole thing is Naomi.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.630
She's the one that sent it.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.382
She's a bitch.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.091
Can't argue that.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.302
So, do you think
maybe, I don't know,

14:46.427 --> 14:48.262
we could hang out sometime?

14:48.388 --> 14:52.183
Yeah... no.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.143
So, what, are you
seeing somebody?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.520
Maybe.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.731
Whatever.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.649
As long as it's not
that Jasper dude.

14:59.774 --> 15:03.027
And what's wrong with Jasper?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.404
You really don't know?

15:04.529 --> 15:06.573
The guy's a psycho.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.575
He pulled a knife
on a guy last spring.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.326
I-I'm sure that's just gossip.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.662
No, it's not.

15:12.787 --> 15:15.248
Jasper is a seriously
messed up guy.

15:17.166 --> 15:21.295
I'd just, I'd be careful
if I were you.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.470
Oh.
Oh, God!

15:29.596 --> 15:31.514
Hey, there you are!

15:31.639 --> 15:32.390
So when, uh, when are we
gonna have our lunch?

15:32.515 --> 15:35.727
Uh, Harry, hi.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.729
How are things?
Well, good.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.146
Are we playing
hide-and-go-seek?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.023
Because I found
you, you're it,

15:41.148 --> 15:42.817
and I feel like
you've been avoiding me.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.194
(weak chuckle)
Uh, no, I've just been

15:45.319 --> 15:47.405
really busy with midterms
and, uh, college counseling.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.990
Oh, uh, so, what about
tomorrow for lunch?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.826
Mm, no, that's no good for me.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.288
Next day?
Uh... oh, let me check.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.039
Okay, I will look.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.751
Um, but I have to go
to a thing, so...

15:59.876 --> 16:01.419
And, um, I'll just,
I'll shoot you an email.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.964
(chuckles)

16:08.301 --> 16:09.636
(doorbell ringing)

16:15.892 --> 16:19.562
Hi, um, I'm here
to see my mother.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.272
You must be Silver.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.232
My name's Mindy.
I'm one of your mom's nurses.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.150
Come in.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.114
I'm glad you're here.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.491
Your mother's going to need

16:31.616 --> 16:32.700
support from her family
during this time.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.368
We have a visitor!

16:34.494 --> 16:35.995
Who is it? Oh!

16:42.502 --> 16:44.337
I just knew you'd come.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.681
Three months?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.641
Oh, that's just a guess.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.643
No one really
knows these things.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.061
But I wouldn't buy any theatre
tickets for much after that.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.480
There's no Stage V.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.651
You haven't
touched your tea.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.737
Oh, uh, I don't
really drink tea.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.155
Just coffee.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.740
Get out. Really?
Since when?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.826
I don't know, four years?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.372
Well, I can get you some coffee.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.500
Don't worry
about the coffee.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.251
When did they find the cancer?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.337
Last year.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.172
I did everything
they told me.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.340
Stopped drinking.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.258
Tried my damndest, anyway.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.386
Had the lump removed,
did the chemo and all that.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.679
For what?

17:36.973 --> 17:39.726
But I guess
they didn't get it all,

17:39.851 --> 17:41.853
and by now it's
spread everywhere.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.773
All I know is that
the "tick, tick, tick"

17:45.899 --> 17:49.068
just gets louder each day.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.991
When I laid into you
at your meeting,

17:55.115 --> 17:57.368
I didn't know
that you were so sick.

17:57.493 --> 18:01.706
You had every right
to say those things.

18:01.831 --> 18:05.710
I was such a
lousy mother.

18:05.835 --> 18:09.797
If I could go back and
change the past, I would.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.509
But all I can do now
is focus on the present.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.469
It's all I have.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.721
That's good.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.932
I mean, it's not too late.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.645
You know, maybe we can
even hang out a little.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.398
I'd like that.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.818
Do you think...

18:30.944 --> 18:32.653
Would you...

18:32.779 --> 18:34.113
What?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.618
Will you move back home?

18:38.743 --> 18:40.411
It'd mean the world to me

18:40.536 --> 18:42.789
to have you here for
the last few months.

18:47.501 --> 18:51.171
♪ ♪

18:51.297 --> 18:52.715
Can I join you for lunch?

18:52.840 --> 18:55.885
And before you answer,

18:56.010 --> 18:58.387
you should know that I haven't
asked one person that

18:58.512 --> 18:59.847
in the past two
miserable years here.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.392
I've actually got this
chem quiz to study for.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.520
That's okay. I, uh,
I eat super quietly,

19:06.646 --> 19:07.730
it's almost freakish.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.400
You know, uh,
I'd rather eat alone.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.611
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm just busy.

19:13.736 --> 19:14.737
What about the
Egyptian later?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.197
Oh, I-I totally forgot.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.699
I signed up
for peer tutoring,

19:18.825 --> 19:20.367
and it starts today,
so I gotta cancel.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.286
Okay, well, maybe, uh...

19:22.411 --> 19:23.955
Some other time.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.713
What?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.048
Yeah, I was counting on you,
man.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.549
I gotta get out there
and meet somebody,

19:35.675 --> 19:37.426
and now my wingman's bailing
on me at the last second?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.303
That's, that's cold, brother.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.888
I'm just saying, you know,

19:41.014 --> 19:42.556
first rule of the
wingman's handbook:

19:42.682 --> 19:43.724
Don't bail on your pilot.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.644
Yeah, all right, later.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.105
(clearing throat)

19:49.229 --> 19:50.815
Sounds like somebody
needs a wingman.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.650
Oh, no, we were just,

19:52.775 --> 19:55.820
uh, making a vague
future sort of plan.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.405
No, hey, I was a primo
wingman back in the day.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.282
And I wouldn't mind
getting out of the house.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.450
Blowing off a little steam.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.743
Knocking back a few frosties.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.453
Frosties?

20:04.578 --> 20:05.705
Brewskies, my friend.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.581
Huh, bitter batters?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.500
Barley pops, brain hammers,

20:09.625 --> 20:10.584
the real man's Zima...

20:10.710 --> 20:11.794
I could go on.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.212
No, I think I got it.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.845
Now, the first round is on moi.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.763
Yeah.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.577
Hey.
Hey.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.871
Um, I got your text.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.330
Thanks for coming.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.875
I know it was
short notice and all.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.543
Okay, here's the thing.

20:52.668 --> 20:56.338
I've been feeling sick
about our fight the other day.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.674
Oh, thank God.
Me, too.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.802
I mean, when we're not getting
along, I can't function.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.679
I couldn't focus
at all in class today.

21:03.804 --> 21:04.889
Naomi, you're not just
my baby sister.

21:05.014 --> 21:05.973
You're my best friend.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.808
And stupid things like money

21:07.934 --> 21:09.309
should never get
in the way of that.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.519
Totally.

21:10.644 --> 21:14.356
Which is why
I've decided to move out.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.483
What?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.152
That's crazy.
Don't be...

21:18.277 --> 21:20.029
Just while I figure out
this divorce thing.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.741
What are you gonna do
for money?

21:23.866 --> 21:25.993
Oh, I'll make do.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.162
Besides, you'll be better off.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.664
You don't need me around,
spending all your money

21:30.790 --> 21:33.834
and dragging you down.

21:36.754 --> 21:41.050
Now, let's see here,
should we order an appetizer?

21:41.175 --> 21:44.678
I want to enjoy this place
while I'm still a member.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.061

21:52.895 --> 21:53.771
Hey, Ryan.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.522
Hey.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.691
Uh, I was wondering,
since she wasn't in class,

21:57.817 --> 21:58.818
if I could give you
a Humanities handout

21:58.943 --> 21:59.902
for Silver.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.112
It's just a short story

22:01.237 --> 22:02.362
and a couple
of essay questions.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.031
She wasn't in class?

22:04.157 --> 22:07.367
No. Uh, I think Adrianna said
something about Silver taking

22:07.493 --> 22:09.328
your mother
to a doctor's appointment.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.957
Yeah, I will make sure
she gets it.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.084

Hi.

22:28.681 --> 22:29.849

22:29.974 --> 22:31.851

22:45.531 --> 22:46.573
Please, don't.
No.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.909
I need to say this.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.244
No, you don't, okay?

22:50.368 --> 22:51.912
What happened between us,
it happened.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.831
We can't change it.

22:53.956 --> 22:57.501
I know.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.253

22:59.377 --> 23:00.880
to tell you to
leave Silver alone.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.756
What?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.842

well right now.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.512

really well.

23:08.637 --> 23:09.805
I know.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.932
I want to be a part of it.

So, what's your take here?

31:51.201 --> 31:52.285
What-what do you think
could have happened?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.621
I don't know.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.207
People are, um,
complicated.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.793
Yeah, I-I tried talking
to Ade, but I got nothing.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.336
It's like she's trying
to hide something.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.046
No.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.591
Look, don't let your imagination
go crazy on you.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.634
No, all I can guess is,
I let her down somehow,

32:07.760 --> 32:09.553
and-and she doesn't want
to hurt me even more

32:09.678 --> 32:10.554
by telling me what I did.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.431
(sighs)

32:12.556 --> 32:14.391
I don't know, man.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.393
All I know is that...

32:16.518 --> 32:18.645
I'm dying here.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.654
Another lovely dinner.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.656
Yes.

32:29.782 --> 32:33.076
And the chances of it leading
to an even lovelier breakfast?

32:33.201 --> 32:34.327
(Jen laughs)

32:34.453 --> 32:37.330
You never give up, do you?

32:37.456 --> 32:40.041
I've yet to meet a
horse I can't break.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.462
You know what?

32:43.587 --> 32:45.672
I'm in.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.132
You're spending
the night?

32:47.257 --> 32:48.592
No.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.470
I'm buying a racehorse.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.847
I want Continental Accent.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.683
It's an extremely
risky business.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.685
Which is why it sounds fun.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.562
Yeah, but why be impulsive?

33:00.687 --> 33:02.522
I would hate to see
you lose your money.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.399
Who's talking about my money?

33:04.524 --> 33:07.360
I've just received
a generous gift, and, well,

33:07.486 --> 33:09.571
I have a spare hundred grand.

33:11.615 --> 33:12.741
Sorry-- forgot
a blanket.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.326
That's okay.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.453
You want a
glass of wine?
Yeah.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.623
Didn't really, uh, peg you
as a picnic basket guy.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.541
Yeah, my parents are
Hollywood Bowl fanatics,

33:21.667 --> 33:23.585
and they never go
without a full spread.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.421
Well, it's nice
that you learned from them.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.173
Oh, no, I just
took their basket.

33:28.298 --> 33:29.675
You stole their food?

33:29.800 --> 33:31.551
They were seeing
Barry Manilow tonight.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.261
Anybody lame enough
to see Barry Manilow

33:33.386 --> 33:34.554
deserves what they get, right?

33:34.680 --> 33:36.765
(giggling):
You're awful.

33:37.808 --> 33:39.685
I'm such an idiot.

33:39.810 --> 33:43.730
I had a perfect life, and
I completely sabotaged it.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.821
I just lost the love of my life.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.282
What am I going to
do without Navid?

33:54.407 --> 33:56.075
Okay, enough with the self-pity.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.870
This just happened, Ade.

33:57.995 --> 34:00.706
It's not like he's
gone off to war

34:00.831 --> 34:02.666
or married
some wealthy duchess.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.793
You can still fix this.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.294
You really
think I can?

34:06.419 --> 34:07.754
Yeah.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.130
He's a great guy, granted.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.592
But it's Navid,
not George Clooney.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.929
It's not like he's moved on
or anything.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.899
Wingman surrendering his keys,
pilot, sir.

34:27.024 --> 34:29.108
I don't really know
how they talk.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.944
No, I think you nailed it.

34:34.907 --> 34:36.114
Call me.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.617
What, me or him?
(laughs)

34:46.543 --> 34:48.795
(imitating Naomi):
Oh, whatever, skank.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.505
Silver, Adrianna, follow me.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.797
(laughing)

35:03.852 --> 35:06.312
God, Annie,
you are so hot.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.355
(chuckles)

35:07.480 --> 35:08.732
We're a little exposed
out here.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.442
Oh, no, we're okay.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.319
Unless someone's flying
into LAX super low.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.614
Worse case, we'll just
give them a thrill.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.742
Uh, you know,
we should probably

35:18.867 --> 35:20.201
start thinking
about getting home.

35:20.326 --> 35:21.453
Oh, come on.

35:21.578 --> 35:22.704
Don't be a tease.

35:22.829 --> 35:23.830
I'm not
being a tease.

35:23.956 --> 35:25.206
I'm just ready
to leave.

35:25.331 --> 35:26.499
It's still early.
Come on.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.709
No, seriously.

35:27.834 --> 35:28.752
What is the big deal?

35:28.877 --> 35:30.169
Don't be a prude.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.421
Mark, no.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.798
Your lips are
saying no,

35:32.923 --> 35:34.466
but your body
says yes.

35:34.591 --> 35:35.717
Mark, get off of me.

35:35.842 --> 35:36.885
I mean it.
Yeah, right.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.638
Mark...

35:48.605 --> 35:49.648
Take one step

35:49.773 --> 35:52.400
near either of us,
and I'm calling the cops.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.507
Hey. Are you okay?

36:27.019 --> 36:28.520
Hope I didn't scare
you back there,

36:28.645 --> 36:29.521
jumping out and all.

36:29.646 --> 36:30.689
No, please.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.273
I'm so glad you did.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.651
Yeah, I just...
I don't know--

36:34.776 --> 36:37.403
when I saw you guys
leaving together,

36:37.529 --> 36:39.572
I had a bad feeling.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.324
Well, thanks.

36:43.076 --> 36:44.911
Will you tell
me one thing?

36:45.037 --> 36:46.496
What got you
all weirded out

36:46.621 --> 36:47.831
the other day
in the cafeteria?

36:47.956 --> 36:49.749
Yeah, that.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.418
Um, fully my fault.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.838
Uh, honestly,
I can't believe this,

36:54.963 --> 36:57.298
but it's because
of something that Mark said.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.675
Get out.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.301
That creep is dissing me?

37:00.426 --> 37:01.720
What did he say?

37:01.845 --> 37:03.763
Wait, let me guess.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.765
"Man, that Jasper,
don't trust him.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.518
"He doesn't, uh...
he doesn't play football.

37:08.643 --> 37:09.769
"He doesn't hang
up freshman

37:09.895 --> 37:10.687
"by their underwear.

37:10.812 --> 37:11.813
He's a freak."

37:13.565 --> 37:14.816
Yeah.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.651
Something like that.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.696
I mean, he said you pulled
a knife on somebody.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.406
What?

37:21.531 --> 37:22.741
What a crock.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.326
I mean, I knew he'd make up
some outrageous lie,

37:25.451 --> 37:27.871
but that, I did not expect.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.123
I got to give him props
for creativity, right?

37:33.043 --> 37:34.669
Look...

37:34.794 --> 37:36.880
I know, uh...

37:37.005 --> 37:39.007
that's what got
you scared off.

37:39.132 --> 37:40.675
But it's cool.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.678
Yeah, but I'm...

37:43.803 --> 37:46.139

38:01.154 --> 38:02.405
Oh, no, no!

38:02.530 --> 38:04.490
Now there's no room for
the cranberry juice.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.035
Your mom's magical
hangover cure, huh?

38:07.160 --> 38:08.578
Yeah, with
cranberry juice.

38:08.703 --> 38:09.829
All right,
you know what, honey?

the way across town
