WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:08.138
<i>I-I can see you!
Can you see me?</i>

00:08.201 --> 00:10.536
Finally! How many days
has it been?

00:10.624 --> 00:11.676
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

00:11.764 --> 00:13.462
<i>We ended up having to extend
our research trip.</i>

00:13.549 --> 00:15.507
<i>But it was totally worth it
because we discovered</i>

00:15.594 --> 00:18.483
<i>a new breed of fly
that mates with itself.</i>

00:18.848 --> 00:20.635
Yummm! Mm.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.359
Well, I guess if this is
what you look like

00:22.446 --> 00:23.863
after finding some gross fly,

00:23.950 --> 00:26.040
I can forgive you for being
away for so long.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.185
<i>I've actually been bench
pressing 100-pound tortoises</i>

00:28.272 --> 00:29.869
<i>because there's no gym here.</i>

00:29.956 --> 00:32.481
Ted! Stop making me jealous
of turtles.

00:32.567 --> 00:36.702
<i>Tortoises, but I do have
tur-tell you</i>

00:36.789 --> 00:40.532
<i>that I've been thinking
about you, a lot,</i>

00:40.620 --> 00:42.995
<i>especially at nighttime.</i>

00:43.113 --> 00:45.189
What a coincidence.

00:45.511 --> 00:47.443
I've been thinking about you
a lot.

00:47.531 --> 00:49.098
At nighttime.

00:49.334 --> 00:53.113
I've been all alone and lonely.

00:53.201 --> 00:54.239
Oh!

00:54.327 --> 00:57.079
Oh my God, David!
Knock much?!

00:57.198 --> 00:58.427
<i>Hi, David!</i>

00:58.515 --> 01:00.778
Hi. Is he dressed?

01:00.866 --> 01:02.389
- Yes!
- Ugh. Forget it.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.172
Okay, we're celebrating
our anniversary.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.476
Can you give us some privacy,
please?

01:06.889 --> 01:08.335
Kids, just wanna let you know

01:08.423 --> 01:10.154
I'm taking the car this morning.

01:10.242 --> 01:11.036
- Ugh!
- Mm.

01:11.124 --> 01:12.577
You might wanna say hi to Ted.

01:12.672 --> 01:15.708
He and Alexis were about
to engage in cyber-sex.

01:15.796 --> 01:17.189
Mm!

01:17.518 --> 01:19.299
- Hi, Ted.
- <i>Hi, Mr. Rose.</i>

01:19.395 --> 01:20.865
Alexis,
what have I told you

01:20.953 --> 01:22.694
about putting your body
on the internet?

01:22.921 --> 01:24.923
Never! Never without proper
lighting.

01:25.011 --> 01:26.226
Can everyone get out, please?!

01:26.314 --> 01:28.641
I haven't seen my boyfriend
in like eight days.

01:28.729 --> 01:31.601
And I haven't seen my furry
Fendi's for weeks.

01:31.744 --> 01:32.855
<i>Hi, Mrs. Rose!</i>

01:32.943 --> 01:34.737
No. We're not engaging
with them.

01:34.999 --> 01:37.284
Everybody out so I can
finish off with Ted!

01:37.372 --> 01:39.829
- Sick!
- Ugh! Goodbye, please!

01:39.917 --> 01:40.999
Found them!

01:41.363 --> 01:43.850

Episode Title :<font color=#FFc30f>"The Job Interview"</font>

01:51.875 --> 01:53.355
What took you so long?

01:53.450 --> 01:55.128
Uh, you said it was
an emergency,

01:55.216 --> 01:57.827
- so I came straight here.
- You stopped for coffee?

01:57.914 --> 01:59.947
And a breakfast burrito
that I got to go.

02:00.035 --> 02:01.717
So what's going on?

02:03.432 --> 02:05.786
I need you to help me...

02:06.420 --> 02:08.209
put together an outfit.

02:08.532 --> 02:10.317
'Kay, I have a job interview
this afternoon

02:10.405 --> 02:12.182
and I need to look
professional.

02:12.484 --> 02:14.755
So, does that mean you're
officially leaving the motel?

02:15.456 --> 02:17.327
No. just, I don't know,

02:17.415 --> 02:19.765
I'm just, you know, trying
to see what's out there.

02:19.853 --> 02:21.367
- Mm.
- And...

02:21.470 --> 02:25.453
Larry Air is hosting
an open call

02:25.541 --> 02:27.108
for employment opportunities.

02:27.204 --> 02:30.512
Okay, "Larrierre" sounds
like a dollar-store perfume.

02:30.599 --> 02:31.997
It's an airline.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.479
Larry is the name of the CEO.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.541
He used to own a chain
of delis,

02:36.629 --> 02:38.588
but then he sold them

02:38.781 --> 02:40.761
to buy a bunch of planes.
Mm.

02:40.849 --> 02:43.199
I get to travel,
see the world.

02:43.287 --> 02:45.134
Mhmm. You know that
I was once told

02:45.222 --> 02:47.194
that I would make an excellent
flight attendant.

02:47.591 --> 02:49.427
Hmm! By who?

02:49.515 --> 02:52.002
Sandy, the hostess on
our private plane.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.456
She once let me debone
a branzino

02:54.544 --> 02:56.872
during turbulence.
So what're you trying to say?

02:56.960 --> 02:59.182
You don't think I have what it
takes to be a flight attendant?

02:59.432 --> 03:01.347
No. I just think if it's
between the two of us,

03:01.760 --> 03:03.197
we all know who's getting
the job.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.503
Oh! Okay.

03:05.590 --> 03:07.703
Why don't you come with me then
and...

03:07.915 --> 03:09.525
and we'll see who gets it.

03:09.986 --> 03:13.979
Well, if this is what
we're working with,

03:14.176 --> 03:16.910
I think we can hand me
the contract today.

03:17.472 --> 03:18.792
I need a boot.

03:19.086 --> 03:21.604
I think the pitch
for the new motel went well.

03:21.975 --> 03:23.020
If all goes to plan,

03:23.115 --> 03:26.116
we should be able to move
forward even without Stevie.

03:26.657 --> 03:28.090
I want you to know, Johnny,

03:28.178 --> 03:31.050
I am not gonna abandon you
like she did.

03:31.137 --> 03:34.405
- Stevie didn't abandon us.
- Well, jump ship.

03:34.493 --> 03:36.041
Look, origami!

03:36.129 --> 03:38.566
All right, gentlemen,
I spoke with my manager

03:38.654 --> 03:39.884
and everyone's in agreement

03:39.972 --> 03:41.253
that this proposal
is excellent.

03:41.341 --> 03:43.192
Ah! That sounds good!

03:43.324 --> 03:46.631
Unfortunately, we couldn't
offer the loan at this time.

03:47.817 --> 03:49.732
Sorry, I might've gotten
confused there.

03:49.820 --> 03:52.301
The bank has assessed that
you don't have enough assets

03:52.420 --> 03:53.592
to secure the loan.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.727
I have assets.
I'm invested in the motel.

03:56.815 --> 03:59.069
Which doesn't appear
to be in your name.

03:59.157 --> 04:01.202
That's right, it's in
my partner's name.

04:01.290 --> 04:02.857
So, you're Stevie Budd?

04:02.975 --> 04:04.658
No.
Believe it or not,

04:04.746 --> 04:06.051
that's actually a woman's name.

04:06.139 --> 04:08.178
Look, there must be something
we can do here.

04:08.266 --> 04:10.529
I ran a major business
for 30 years.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.301
Yeah, and look at the way
this guy bounced back

04:12.439 --> 04:13.962
from total financial ruin.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.607
You know, there was a day
when banks

04:15.695 --> 04:17.774
would provide loans
based solely

04:17.970 --> 04:21.365
on their faith in a very solid
business idea.

04:21.452 --> 04:23.542
That's gonna be a tough sell
to my boss.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.457
We don't offer faith-based
loans.

04:25.545 --> 04:28.134
Okay, uh, I did not wanna
play this card,

04:28.222 --> 04:29.684
but... I will.

04:30.204 --> 04:32.720
I am the mayor.
You already mentioned that.

04:32.808 --> 04:34.764
'Kay, did I mention I went
steady with your mom?

04:34.852 --> 04:35.984
Unfortunately, you did.

04:36.072 --> 04:38.335
Okay, then I'm out.
I got nothing.

04:40.736 --> 04:42.339
Honey, you're home!

04:42.426 --> 04:43.818
Yay!

04:44.802 --> 04:46.021
Alexis!

04:46.109 --> 04:48.649
Your father and I are going
to meet for a celebratory lunch

04:48.737 --> 04:50.261
when he's done at the bank,
and...

04:50.501 --> 04:52.459
I was supposed to invite you
to join us.

04:52.547 --> 04:54.201
Yeah, I'm a little busy.

04:55.121 --> 04:57.384
What in God's name do you
have there?

04:57.558 --> 05:00.193
Please tell me it's not
a testudine.

05:00.281 --> 05:01.674
No, it's a turtle.

05:01.878 --> 05:05.770
Alexis!
Turtles do not pets make.

05:05.924 --> 05:08.840
The poor things are riddled
with a myriad of diseases.

05:08.928 --> 05:11.975
You may as well tie a leash
around a raw chicken cutlet.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.499
Relax, they said he's already
been washed.

05:14.586 --> 05:16.323
Say hello to Ted.

05:16.426 --> 05:19.086
Hello, Theodore.
I don't see the computer.

05:19.228 --> 05:21.201
No, I've named the turtle Ted.

05:21.289 --> 05:23.856
All the blogs about successful
long-term relationships

05:23.943 --> 05:27.469
say that the key is creating
shared experiences.

05:27.556 --> 05:29.035
Oh dear.

05:29.122 --> 05:31.550
If your coupling is
too frangible to survive

05:31.638 --> 05:33.060
this brief disunion...

05:33.148 --> 05:34.867
Okay, I am trying my best.

05:34.954 --> 05:36.889
Is this supposed to be making
me feel better?

05:37.023 --> 05:39.069
Oh, very well. Alexis,

05:39.243 --> 05:41.699
if you desire a love
with longevity,

05:41.787 --> 05:44.905
the key is to have as little
in common as possible.

05:45.138 --> 05:48.054
After an award-worthy trilogy
of decades together,

05:48.141 --> 05:52.207
your father and I still
astonish each other.

05:52.731 --> 05:55.242
Although today,
I will but feign surprise

05:55.330 --> 05:57.933
when he tells me
he's secured a hefty loan

05:58.021 --> 06:00.415
to initiate our imminent
connecting departure

06:00.502 --> 06:02.392
from this lengthy layover.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.852
You'll be coming with?

06:03.940 --> 06:07.509
No. I have to give Ted
his pellets,

06:07.597 --> 06:09.653
and then put him down
for a little nap.

06:10.163 --> 06:11.381
Sexy.

06:12.941 --> 06:14.492
Mm! Mm!

06:15.962 --> 06:18.996
Now is this look comfortable
for you, or uncomfortable?

06:19.268 --> 06:21.566
Uh, you dress for the job
you want.

06:21.653 --> 06:23.133
So you wanna be a youth
pastor?

06:23.220 --> 06:26.136
Hi. Wow. While, that joke was
surprisingly sharp,

06:26.223 --> 06:27.554
these are Patrick's clothes.

06:27.698 --> 06:30.159
So, you might wanna tell that
to my fiancÃ©'s face.

06:30.428 --> 06:33.344
Mm. "Larry Air,
recent improvements:

06:33.463 --> 06:35.666
all chairs will have tray
tables,

06:35.754 --> 06:37.930
not just first class."

06:38.017 --> 06:39.932
I feel like I'm flying on
the Concorde.

06:40.019 --> 06:42.816
You can leave any time.
I'm fine to do this on my own.

06:42.955 --> 06:45.000
How will I get the job
if I leave now though?

06:45.088 --> 06:46.699
All right, everyone,

06:46.787 --> 06:49.433
If you could please follow me,
we're ready to get started.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.095
Thank you so much.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.471
Well, it is so exciting
to see

06:56.558 --> 06:59.082
how much interest there is
in Larry Air.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.549
Oh, I should mention,
if anyone here is involved

07:01.637 --> 07:03.565
in the class-action lawsuit
against Larry Air,

07:03.715 --> 07:05.673
you are disqualified
from applying.

07:10.477 --> 07:12.827
All right,
why don't we go around,

07:12.922 --> 07:14.837
and I'll have each of you
state your name

07:14.924 --> 07:17.274
and tell us what you consider
your biggest weakness.

07:17.361 --> 07:19.233
Ooh!

07:19.320 --> 07:22.323
Me? Um... Stevie Budd,

07:22.410 --> 07:23.759
and um...

07:23.846 --> 07:26.974
I'd say my biggest weakness
is...

07:27.763 --> 07:30.167
that I'm disorganized.
Ooh, that's true.

07:32.115 --> 07:35.336
- And, um, I'm indecisive.
- Yes.

07:35.423 --> 07:38.279
- Uh... I also...
- Okay.

07:38.390 --> 07:40.689
We just needed one. Next?

07:40.776 --> 07:42.430
Hi. David Rose.

07:42.517 --> 07:45.694
Would we consider loyalty
a weakness?

07:45.781 --> 07:48.479
If not, I'm also really honest.

07:48.566 --> 07:50.481
I'm just gonna put down
chatty.

07:50.568 --> 07:52.309
- Okay.
- Hmph.

07:53.919 --> 07:55.834
Well, she said there was
nothing she could do.

07:55.921 --> 07:57.836
Apparently, I don't have
enough assets.

07:57.923 --> 07:59.708
Yeah, she said apparently

07:59.795 --> 08:01.187
Johnny doesn't have enough
assets.

08:01.274 --> 08:03.189
Yeah, and the problem is,
how do you get assets...

08:03.276 --> 08:04.539
without the loan?

08:04.626 --> 08:05.844
But the the problem is,

08:05.931 --> 08:08.369
how do you get assets
without a loan?

08:08.456 --> 08:11.023
Roland, you're not adding
anything to the sentence,

08:11.110 --> 08:13.025
you're just repeating
what I said.

08:13.112 --> 08:16.377
Anyway, I don't know how long
this will set us back, Moira.

08:16.464 --> 08:20.076
Could be another year or two
before we make any headway.

08:20.163 --> 08:22.513
Oh, surely there's some
penny-wise townsperson

08:22.600 --> 08:25.211
with a hidden rainy-day
reservoir.

08:25.298 --> 08:28.693
Well, you know, uh, I don't
wanna be the town gossip here,

08:28.780 --> 08:31.696
but, uh, the other day,
I got a look at Bob's

08:31.783 --> 08:34.253
financial statement
on his desk in the office,

08:34.341 --> 08:37.446
and that garage is doing great!

08:37.534 --> 08:39.471
Plus, he got plugs last year,
but...

08:39.558 --> 08:40.705
you didn't hear that from me.

08:40.793 --> 08:41.981
You know, come to think
of it,

08:42.068 --> 08:43.370
Gwen has been coming
to rehearsal

08:43.457 --> 08:46.058
- in those fancy yoga clothes.
- Those are not cheap.

08:46.145 --> 08:48.060
I know because I buy
the knockoffs,

08:48.147 --> 08:50.541
and they're not cheap.
Bob...

08:50.628 --> 08:52.064
You know, he was very
interested

08:52.151 --> 08:54.197
in that bagel business
a while ago,

08:54.284 --> 08:56.504
and this is a much stronger
idea.

08:56.591 --> 08:57.635
Roland and I are having
dinner

08:57.722 --> 08:59.768
with Bob and Gwen tonight.

09:00.812 --> 09:02.640
- Bob!
- Hey, folks.

09:02.727 --> 09:04.338
Bob!

09:04.425 --> 09:06.296
Oh, look at you, Robert,

09:06.383 --> 09:08.690
with the hides of a herd
of Holstein on your back.

09:08.777 --> 09:09.910
Yeah.

09:09.998 --> 09:12.856
Sorry, uh, I don't have time
to chat. Uh...

09:12.954 --> 09:15.057
I just had two cups of coffee,

09:15.145 --> 09:17.611
uh, I don't wanna push my luck.

09:17.699 --> 09:19.788
I mean, uh, these pants,

09:19.875 --> 09:23.605
they take like a year
to unlace, so...

09:26.027 --> 09:28.079
Rose's, I hope you like fish,

09:28.167 --> 09:31.193
'cause I think we just reeled
in a big one.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.852
Hey, Alexis. Another green
smoothie, no greens?

09:40.939 --> 09:43.115
Um... yeah,
if you're making one.

09:43.202 --> 09:45.335
No. I'm asking
if you want one.

09:45.422 --> 09:47.729
Okay, Twy, I didn't
like leave anything behind

09:47.816 --> 09:49.578
when I popped by earlier,
did I?

09:49.689 --> 09:52.386
I don't think so, but if you
tell me what you lost,

09:52.473 --> 09:54.257
I can ask George if anyone
turned it in?

09:54.344 --> 09:56.694
No, it's, it's nothing.
It's just a turtle.

09:56.781 --> 09:59.113
- What?
- His name is Ted

09:59.201 --> 10:01.042
and he's gone. And I can't
remember where I put him,

10:01.130 --> 10:02.028
and I thought it was
in the motel,

10:02.116 --> 10:04.047
but he could've like crawled
out of my purse

10:04.135 --> 10:06.142
when I brought him
by the cafe earlier.

10:06.343 --> 10:07.431
Okay.

10:07.636 --> 10:10.621
Turtles are actually kind of
like huge health hazards,

10:10.708 --> 10:12.643
so when did you last see him?

10:12.731 --> 10:14.429
'Kay, it's been weeks.

10:14.548 --> 10:17.098
But between the patchy Wi-Fi

10:17.186 --> 10:18.907
and like the ten-day
nature trips,

10:18.995 --> 10:22.055
and me being alone here,
kind of feels like he left

10:22.143 --> 10:23.981
the day that he flew
to the Galapagos.

10:24.069 --> 10:25.737
The turtle flew
to the Galapagos?

10:25.825 --> 10:28.073
No, Ted the turtle
is missing,

10:28.213 --> 10:30.424
I am now talking about
my boyfriend Ted, Twy.

10:30.512 --> 10:32.470
It'd be great if you could
keep up.

10:32.564 --> 10:33.551
Right. Sorry.

10:33.639 --> 10:35.728
The slowest animal on earth
escaped from me.

10:35.816 --> 10:37.873
That can't not be a bad sign.

10:37.961 --> 10:39.139
My mom had a turtle dove

10:39.227 --> 10:41.258
that was eaten by her
ex-fiancÃ©'s snake.

10:41.637 --> 10:43.975
- That was a bad sign.
- Oh my God.

10:44.094 --> 10:45.852
And it happened on
Valentine's Day.

10:46.034 --> 10:48.427
- Mm.
- And her fiancÃ© was a Satanist.

10:49.268 --> 10:51.660
I think you guys are just going
through a tough time.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.249
But... who knows?

10:54.352 --> 10:55.860
Maybe you'll be pleasantly
surprised

10:55.948 --> 10:57.823
by how much closer this brings
the two of you.

10:57.947 --> 11:00.297
And if it makes you feel
any better,

11:00.528 --> 11:02.878
turtles actually thrive
out of captivity.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.864
Thanks, Twy.

11:09.196 --> 11:11.807
Oh, and if you do see Ted like
waddling around in the kitchen,

11:11.895 --> 11:14.349
just feed him a carrot
and shoot me a text.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.871
I hope you're joking.

11:17.118 --> 11:19.250
Me too, girl.
Love you!

11:24.637 --> 11:26.219
- Excuse me.
- Mm?

11:26.307 --> 11:30.398
This baby behind me has been
crying for over an hour now

11:30.486 --> 11:32.401
and I just can't take it
anymore.

11:32.489 --> 11:34.099
You and me both.

11:34.226 --> 11:36.801
I have shushed them thrice
at this point.

11:37.008 --> 11:38.438
Now, here are your options:

11:38.526 --> 11:41.312
I could either move those two
to the back of the plane,

11:41.400 --> 11:44.095
or I could offer you
some complimentary alcohol

11:44.183 --> 11:46.557
to make your flight
a little more bearable.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.197
Okay. Thank you, David.

11:49.285 --> 11:50.721
Thank you, Carol!

11:51.843 --> 11:54.767
- That was a great example...
- Thank you!

11:54.855 --> 11:57.771
...of what not to do.
David just reminded us

11:57.859 --> 12:00.914
of two touchstone policies
here at Larry Air:

12:01.002 --> 12:02.314
no seat changes,

12:02.402 --> 12:03.957
and "complimentary"

12:04.045 --> 12:06.413
is not in our corporate
vocabulary.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.050
But finger snaps for David!

12:10.209 --> 12:12.126
- We don't... sSure.
- We don't... sSure.

12:12.256 --> 12:16.852
Okay, I think it's time
to move on to the final round.

12:17.074 --> 12:19.433
If I call your name,
please stand up.

12:19.935 --> 12:23.430
Rupinder Pimms,
Tracey Mickleson,

12:23.655 --> 12:26.403
Felix Ng, and David Rose.

12:26.491 --> 12:28.453
- Fuck yes!
- I regret to inform you,

12:28.541 --> 12:31.050
you will not be asked
to continue the process.

12:31.289 --> 12:33.466
This is so embarrassing.

12:33.554 --> 12:35.378
I thought you said David Rose.

12:35.466 --> 12:36.637
I did.

12:37.597 --> 12:39.768
Too bad they didn't have
a branzino to de-bone

12:39.856 --> 12:41.139
- because you would've got this.
- Hmm...

12:41.227 --> 12:43.944
Yeah, hi, Carol?
Uh, it's just that some of us

12:44.079 --> 12:46.208
drove some of the other
applicants here,

12:46.296 --> 12:47.656
so it might just be easier

12:47.744 --> 12:50.181
if we all just moved forward
into the next round.

12:50.389 --> 12:52.906
I think it's best
if you wait in the hall.

12:53.379 --> 12:54.589
Okay.

12:59.286 --> 13:01.399
I'll be taking some of these
complimentary peanuts then.

13:01.487 --> 13:02.584
Oh, as I pointed out,

13:02.672 --> 13:04.577
nothing is complimentary
on Larry Air.

13:04.665 --> 13:06.797
I'm taking the peanuts,
Carol!

13:09.753 --> 13:12.109
Okay, moving on...

13:20.538 --> 13:23.497
Well, hopefully,
Gwen will be here soon.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.368
Oh, we don't have to wait
for Gwen.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.765
Oh, I think we do. It uh...

13:27.853 --> 13:29.681
gives us more time to talk.

13:29.769 --> 13:33.599
How often do good friends get
a chance to sit around and, uh,

13:33.781 --> 13:35.722
and talk?
Right!

13:35.810 --> 13:39.074
And, you know, I didn't get
a chance to tell you before,

13:39.162 --> 13:42.618
but that is one snazzy outfit.
I mean...

13:42.706 --> 13:45.708
Somebody... somebody's
got some money to burn.

13:45.796 --> 13:47.358
Take it easy, Roland.

13:47.446 --> 13:49.426
- Well...
- Let's not embarrass the man.

13:49.514 --> 13:53.288
He obviously knows what
his money can do for him.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.115
This is so exciting!

13:55.203 --> 13:57.117
I feel like I'm a Wolf
of Wall Street.

13:57.205 --> 13:59.182
Good... then let's go get
our lamb.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.796
Oh, are we having lamb?

14:00.884 --> 14:03.537
No, just my Sloppy Jocelyns.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.202
Hope you're hungry, Bob.

14:05.290 --> 14:07.510
Speaking of yummy
opportunities.

14:07.597 --> 14:11.028
John, were you able to return
Bill and Melinda's call today

14:11.116 --> 14:12.031
about the hmm hmm-hmm?

14:12.119 --> 14:14.263
Well, you know, Moira,
we're not supposed to be

14:14.351 --> 14:16.919
discussing investment
opportunities at the table,

14:17.007 --> 14:19.420
no matter how lucrative
they might be.

14:19.508 --> 14:21.697
But you know what the Gateses
are like -

14:21.785 --> 14:23.438
Bill and Melinda.

14:23.526 --> 14:25.702
You know, they're expecting
your call about...

14:25.790 --> 14:26.878
the investment.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.404
- Yeah.
- Wow! You know Bill Gates?

14:29.626 --> 14:32.839
Oh, who doesn't?
But you're right, Bob,

14:33.051 --> 14:34.580
why gild their lilies

14:34.667 --> 14:37.836
when there might be someone
right under our noses

14:37.924 --> 14:39.750
looking for a lucrative venture?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.753
Well, I... look, I...

14:41.841 --> 14:43.992
I might as well just come clean:

14:44.500 --> 14:45.938
Gwen's not coming.

14:46.034 --> 14:47.741
Let's eat.

14:47.829 --> 14:49.713
Yeah, she, uh, she left me.

14:50.595 --> 14:54.019
I'm sorry, it's just all this,
all this money talk,

14:54.107 --> 14:55.664
and all I can think about

14:55.752 --> 14:58.450
is how much I spent on
this suit.

14:58.682 --> 15:00.519
Gwen, she told me, you know,

15:00.606 --> 15:02.565
she said, "I like bad boys,"

15:02.862 --> 15:05.053
and now she's holed up
with our minister.

15:05.141 --> 15:08.956
She was bragging about
a religious experience.

15:09.274 --> 15:11.650
Perhaps there's an upside
to all this,

15:11.738 --> 15:13.697
fiscally speaking.
Hmm!

15:16.318 --> 15:18.569
Oh no, no.

15:20.198 --> 15:23.455
Listen, uh, Johnny,
I, I hate to ask,

15:23.542 --> 15:25.283
but, uh, you just seem to have

15:25.370 --> 15:28.061
so many, uh, high-profile
friends.

15:28.204 --> 15:30.554
Do you think one of them
might be open to...

15:30.642 --> 15:32.165
cutting me a loan?

15:32.253 --> 15:35.082
See, Gwen and Parson Jim,
they're...

15:35.189 --> 15:37.017
they're after the house.

15:38.307 --> 15:39.526
Mm.

15:45.264 --> 15:47.987
So, are you just never gonna
talk to me ever again?

15:48.075 --> 15:49.632
I asked you to roll up
the window in the car.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.119
The highway smelled like manure.

15:51.183 --> 15:53.146
Okay. It just seems like
you're upset.

15:53.249 --> 15:54.455
Not upset.

15:54.543 --> 15:56.414
Just didn't feel like talking
in the car. So.

15:56.668 --> 15:57.974
Okay.

15:58.062 --> 16:00.151
Did Carol embarrass herself

16:00.239 --> 16:02.110
by sending me away
in front of everybody?

16:02.322 --> 16:03.536
Absolutely.

16:03.624 --> 16:06.912
Was the entire group shocked
by that decision?

16:07.031 --> 16:09.242
Seemed like it based on
some people's faces.

16:09.329 --> 16:11.244
Now ask me if I care.

16:11.331 --> 16:13.776
- Do you care...
- Don't care! I don't care!

16:15.205 --> 16:18.169
You are such a sore loser.

16:18.257 --> 16:19.601
I am not!

16:19.688 --> 16:22.715
I'm not. It's just, do you
really wanna work for a place

16:22.803 --> 16:25.026
that clearly doesn't know
what they're doing?

16:25.317 --> 16:27.990
Oh, well, they really want me
to work for them,

16:28.078 --> 16:31.221
so I have to trust that they
do know what they're doing.

16:33.709 --> 16:35.950
- Okay.
- Admit it.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.064
I'm more qualified than you.

16:39.882 --> 16:41.918
- Fine.
- Admit it.

16:42.006 --> 16:43.475
You're more qualified
than me.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.109
- Thank you!
- Now...

16:46.197 --> 16:48.377
let's see what exciting new
job opportunities await you

16:48.465 --> 16:49.979
in your new career
as an airline hostess.

16:50.066 --> 16:52.198
Give me that! Give it!

16:52.285 --> 16:54.884
I am so embarrassed for you!

16:55.046 --> 16:58.160
Now, I would love to use one
of Larry Air's

16:58.248 --> 17:01.033
"completely private"
new paid toilets.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.545
I don't know why they have
to stress "completely private."

17:03.633 --> 17:05.346
Get out! Get out!

17:06.951 --> 17:08.294
No.

17:11.575 --> 17:13.271
Ugh!

17:15.125 --> 17:17.867
Ted! Dinner's ready!

17:19.617 --> 17:21.184
Ugh!

17:24.743 --> 17:26.823
- Alexis Rose?
- Yes?

17:26.911 --> 17:28.844
Mr. Mullens has arranged
a limo for you.

17:28.931 --> 17:30.557
If you could please come
with me.

17:30.679 --> 17:32.925
How do I know this isn't like
an abduction or something?

17:33.013 --> 17:34.928
It's not an abduction.

17:35.024 --> 17:37.287
You didn't blink.
I believe you.

17:37.374 --> 17:39.202
Um, okay, I'll be out in five.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:48.341 --> 17:49.952
Good evening, Ms. Rose.

17:50.039 --> 17:53.185
The other member of your party
has already been seated.

17:54.513 --> 17:56.951
<i>âª I tell myself that I'm... âª</i>

17:58.699 --> 18:01.485
<i>âª So lucky âª</i>

18:01.572 --> 18:03.792
<i>âª To be loving you âª</i>

18:03.879 --> 18:05.402
<i> Oh, hi. </i>

18:05.489 --> 18:07.706
Ted! What is this?

18:07.794 --> 18:09.320
<i>Well, I couldn't let
our anniversary go</i>

18:09.408 --> 18:10.473
<i>without a celebration.</i>

18:10.561 --> 18:11.926
<i>Just because we're not in
the same city</i>

18:12.018 --> 18:13.630
<i>doesn't mean that we can't go
on a date.</i>

18:13.718 --> 18:15.128
And you're wearing
the little tie

18:15.216 --> 18:17.761
with your short-sleeved shirt.
My little Galapo-guy.

18:17.849 --> 18:19.973
<i>Yeah, it's actually really
hot here,</i>

18:20.061 --> 18:22.580
<i>so the bottom half is just my
bathing suit and flip-flops.</i>

18:22.668 --> 18:25.683
Ted! More about your
bottom half, please!

18:25.778 --> 18:28.347
<i>Twyla's not standing right
behind you, is she?</i>

18:29.165 --> 18:30.636
Hi, Ted.

18:30.866 --> 18:32.258
<i>Twyla, again,</i>

18:32.346 --> 18:33.894
<i>I can't thank you enough
for making this happen.</i>

18:34.060 --> 18:36.520
Um, I can lock up
if you wanna go, Twy.

18:36.607 --> 18:38.261
Oh, someone has to serve you
dinner.

18:38.348 --> 18:41.368
But don't worry,
I'll stay out of your way.

18:43.104 --> 18:46.530
<i>Alexis, I'm sorry for
dropping the ball on our calls.</i>

18:46.617 --> 18:48.662
<i>I thought that we would have
Wi-Fi on the trip</i>

18:48.749 --> 18:50.698
<i>and we didn't, so...
the rest of the team</i>

18:50.786 --> 18:52.623
<i>just had to listen to me talk
about you for seven days.</i>

18:52.710 --> 18:56.329
In fact, they actually named
the new fly "Alexis."

18:56.448 --> 18:58.339
The fly that mates
with itself?

18:58.960 --> 19:01.457
<i>Yeah, I think the important
thing is that, now,</i>

19:01.545 --> 19:03.808
<i>I have a little Alexis here
with me,</i>

19:03.981 --> 19:05.419
<i>just buzzing around.</i>

19:05.685 --> 19:08.596
I'm just like so happy
to see your face.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.130
Me too.

19:10.946 --> 19:13.122
- <i>âª So lucky âª</i>
- Boop!

19:13.209 --> 19:14.732
- Boop!
- <i>âª To be loving you âª</i>

19:25.452 --> 19:27.657
Okay, John, I'm going to
throw another name at you:

19:27.745 --> 19:29.965
Ronnie. Owns her own business,
no kids.

19:30.052 --> 19:32.663
Clearly doesn't spend any money
on herself.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.840
I appreciate the enthusiasm,
Moira, but uh...

19:35.927 --> 19:38.538
I just got off the phone
with Betty Terkstra.

19:38.884 --> 19:40.434
She sold the place.

19:41.275 --> 19:42.451
No, John!

19:42.539 --> 19:45.239
I'll keep an eye open
for a less pricey property,

19:45.327 --> 19:46.694
but, uh, without Stevie,

19:46.782 --> 19:48.330
I think we're in a bit
of a bind.

19:48.418 --> 19:50.777
Oh, John, hold me.

19:51.076 --> 19:53.320
Good is coming, it has to.

19:59.947 --> 20:01.561
Hello, Johnny!

20:01.648 --> 20:03.586
Look, I appreciate
the gesture, guys,

20:03.674 --> 20:06.068
but, uh, this is not a good
night for champagne.

20:06.262 --> 20:08.046
Oh, speak for yourself, John.

20:08.133 --> 20:11.491
Oh good, you're lying down!
We have big news.

20:11.579 --> 20:14.626
If you're referring to the
bath-time video Gwen posted...

20:14.714 --> 20:16.934
N-no, n-no, it's...
it's not that exciting.

20:17.022 --> 20:18.937
No, um...

20:19.025 --> 20:21.571
Well, we...

20:22.882 --> 20:25.623
- BOUGHT THE MOTEL!
- What?!

20:25.718 --> 20:28.544
Yeah, we took out a second
mortgage on our house.

20:28.632 --> 20:31.546
Yeah. After what went down
at dinner,

20:31.634 --> 20:33.278
Joc and I started talking,
and we figured,

20:33.366 --> 20:36.242
well, if it's good enough
for Bill Gates to invest in,

20:36.330 --> 20:38.555
it's, uh, good enough for us
to invest in.

20:38.642 --> 20:40.383
Roland, we don't actually
know...

20:40.470 --> 20:43.646
I'm, I'm sorry,
I'm, I'm not comprehending.

20:43.765 --> 20:45.506
We...

20:45.608 --> 20:48.039
are buying into the business.

20:48.703 --> 20:51.504
Say hello to your new
business partners.

20:51.773 --> 20:54.951
Oh, well, if that's not cause
for alcohol

20:55.039 --> 20:56.485
I don't know what is.

20:56.573 --> 20:58.618
So, we have the motel?

20:58.705 --> 20:59.973
We sure do.

21:00.061 --> 21:02.411
Now, first order of business,

21:02.646 --> 21:04.257
we need name tags.

21:06.601 --> 21:09.856
I don't believe this!
Roland, we will make this work.

21:09.944 --> 21:11.063
- Yes.
- We'll make it work.

21:11.151 --> 21:13.804
- Thank you. Thank you, Roland.
- All right.

21:16.616 --> 21:18.485
Why is there a turtle
on the floor?

21:18.727 --> 21:20.294
Alexis!
