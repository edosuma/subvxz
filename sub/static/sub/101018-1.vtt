I'm sure it's some sort of
misunderstanding or--

03:28.542 --> 03:30.809
- Mr. Hoffman, please vacate...

- I don't know.
- It's alright.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.688
Maybe they're confused
or something.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.756

accident.

you're under arrest.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.194
What can I say?
They were a nice couple.

04:22.196 --> 04:23.729
A nice Christian couple.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.064
This nice Christian couple
we can find no trace of?

04:26.066 --> 04:29.034
Oh, I can be held responsible
for that now, can I?

04:29.036 --> 04:30.535
I'm a pilot, man.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.105
I make a living
transporting shit.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.740
I-- it's all in the manifest.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.208
Sorry, I-- I don't know
what you want from me here.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.476
Here's the thing, Hoffman.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.711
I meet scumbags
like you all the time.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.247
You're the sort of guy
if you could make a 1000 bucks

04:42.249 --> 04:43.949
honest or ten bucks
doing it crooked

04:43.951 --> 04:46.151
you'd do it crooked every time.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.487
I-- I bet you, you'd fuck
your own mother for a quarter.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.623
[laughs] If you're trying
to charm me, sir,

04:51.625 --> 04:52.924
you're not doing a great job--

04:52.926 --> 04:53.959
But worse than fucking
your own mother

04:53.961 --> 04:55.827
you'd fuck your own kids?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.596
You take them on a drug run?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.464
- That is the lowest.
- I took them to Disney World.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.434
- You took them to Bolivia.
- To deliver Bibles.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.770
Okay, I thought
they would have fun.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.105
Except it turns out that Bolivia
is a shithole.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.774
So, we took them to Disney World
on the way back.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.509
You took them
to Bolivia as cover

05:10.511 --> 05:12.010
and you picked up so much coke
you thought

05:12.012 --> 05:14.246
you'd celebrate
in Disney on the way back.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.814
Okay, Ben, listen to me.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.316
Don't call me Ben.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.017
It said, Ben, on your badge.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.820
It says, Benedict J. Tisa,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.622

05:23.624 --> 05:25.023

05:25.793 --> 05:27.626
I like that.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.795
I like you, you know.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.663
And I really like your suit.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.765
You look great, you're the best
dressed guy here.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.000
You know that.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.869

you want, right?

05:37.871 --> 05:39.805
Okay, look,
special agent in charge

05:39.807 --> 05:41.273
I swear to you on my life

I knew nothing about
any of this.

05:46.046 --> 05:49.047
[intense music]

05:49.049 --> 05:51.450
Seems like you got a sweet
family out there.

Benedict: But you're not gonna
see them for 30 years.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.256

06:08.335 --> 06:10.068
I don't know who this other
guy is though.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.970
You know exactly who it is,
because Morgan Hetrick--

06:11.972 --> 06:13.438
Man 8: Sir?

06:18.379 --> 06:19.978
[indistinct chatter]

06:19.980 --> 06:21.980
You landed in Pensacola,
Florida.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.749
You subleased out your plane
and it was

06:23.751 --> 06:26.685
out of your possession
for three nights.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.887
Three magical nights
at Disney World, yes.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.691
Are we done here?

06:32.693 --> 06:35.827
- So, that's it?
- That's it, yeah.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.028
Yeah, I mean I had
the paperwork, you know

06:37.030 --> 06:38.530
you can't argue with paperwork.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.732
Jim, some of those people
that you work with

06:40.734 --> 06:43.034
I do not think
have your best interest in mind.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.770
I agree, no, I-- I think, uh

06:44.772 --> 06:46.371
Bolivia was a pretty
big clue, huh?

06:46.373 --> 06:48.206
- This is a wake up call.
- It's a wake up call.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.609
- We need to start fresh.
- Somewhere new, absolutely.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.377
This time I'm gonna pick where.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.579
- No, no, no, no. No.
- Yeah. We'll put it to a vote.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.047
What do you mean we're gonna
vote? We're not gonna vote.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.416
Yes, we will put it to a vote,

06:57.418 --> 06:59.117
we live in a democracy.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.620
No, no, no, no. No, you think
you live in a democracy.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.456
All in favor of mom choosing
where we live next.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.625
Jim: Oh, hey, guys,
come on, think about it.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.959
We're gonna end up
livin' in some dump.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.061
You know, your mom has no taste.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.563
She married you.

It's a really nice neighborhood,
honey.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.072
Yeah, don't worry,
it'll be fine.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.674
Only the best for my family.

Go ahead, door's open.
Go in, check it out.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.278
Howard: Mr. Hoffman.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.048
Who are you exactly?

08:04.351 --> 08:05.584
- Well, I'm not really--
- No, no, no.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.419
Don't answer that,
Mr. Hoffman.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.955
It was a rhetorical question.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.823
So, we're to find out
exactly who you are,

08:11.825 --> 08:13.792
we're gonna find out
what wasn't quite forthcoming

08:13.794 --> 08:16.495
with the prosecution evidence.

08:16.497 --> 08:20.031
Pauma valley,
it's beautiful up there.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.333
Not cheap though, is it?

08:23.303 --> 08:24.836
Sorry, do you want me
to answer that one?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.372
[crowd laughing]

08:27.374 --> 08:29.641
- Yes.
- No, sir, not cheap.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.644
- You have a mortgage? Renting?
- Renting.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.980
- And what's the rent like?
- Sixteen hundred a month.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.816
[whistles] That's, uh,
that's a lot of money.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.619
Why don't we take a quick look
at your, your IRS returns,

08:40.621 --> 08:42.354
see how you can, uh,
afford such, uh,

08:42.356 --> 08:44.055
a nice spread in Pauma valley.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.291
What would you say, at random,

08:46.293 --> 08:48.660
you filed for in 1980?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.128
I did not file in 1980.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.563
Did you file in 1979?

08:51.565 --> 08:53.131
- No, sir, I did not.
- 1978?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.466
- No, sir.
- '77?

08:54.468 --> 08:55.534
1977?

08:55.536 --> 08:57.369
[crowd laughing]

08:59.006 --> 09:01.406
You think this is funny,
Mr. Hoffman?

09:01.408 --> 09:02.807
[chuckles] No, sir.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.310
You do realize
that it is illegal

09:05.312 --> 09:06.845
not to file a tax return?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.213
Yes, sir.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.683
But you did file in 1982.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.084
How come?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.920
Just tryin'
to do the right thing.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.255
Well, there is a first time
for everything.

Boy 3: Try to escape.
Try to escape.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.501
Yeah, just keep distracting her.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.102
Hey! Guys, what's going on here?

09:31.104 --> 09:34.039
Dad, dad, o-- okay
if we go play in their pool?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.440
- Please.
- Please let us play.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.575
Hold on, buddy,
I mean, these guys

09:36.577 --> 09:37.776
look like trouble if you ask me.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.110
- Mom?
- It's time to go home.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.579
- Mommy.
- Hi, my love.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.080
Cristina: Good, good, good.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.249
Hi, I hope they're not being
a nuisance.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.351
No, not at all, no.
More than welcome.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.087
Oh, we haven't had a chance to
welcome you to the neighborhood.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.457
We're always coming and going.
Cristina.

09:52.459 --> 09:55.226
Oh, I'm... Sorry. Uh, hey.
Hi, Jim.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.728
Hi.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.463
Mom, can they come swim with us?

09:58.465 --> 10:00.865
It's alright with me if that's
alright with their dad.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.567
Yeah, no, of course.
They're very good.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.402
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, no problem.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.571
- Ni-- nice to meet you.
- Let's go! Come on.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.039
Come on, baby.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.441
Mommy. Are we going?

10:09.443 --> 10:11.776
Am I gonna try on

the girls loved it.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.766
Would you mind if I, uh...

11:09.503 --> 11:11.503
Yeah, be my guest.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.343
Yeah, there she is.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.644
Alright.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.346
Turn it over.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.681
Okay.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.683
[engine cranking]

11:26.687 --> 11:27.919
[laughs]

11:31.124 --> 11:32.457
How the hell did you do that?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.426
Ah, beginner's luck.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.563
And I designed it.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.966
You designed it?
What, what, you designed what?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.704
What, you designed the GTO?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.575
Holy shit. Holy shit.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.377
You're John DeLorean,
aren't you?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.245
[laughs]

11:54.247 --> 11:58.216
Amazing. Well, that, I... Hey,
great job on this, you know.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.484
I mean, Shakespeare writes
a play, he at least

11:59.486 --> 12:00.652
gets to put his name on it.

12:00.654 --> 12:02.554
Well, I might do that yet.

12:02.556 --> 12:06.357
Yeah. Uh... Hey, hold on
a second, okay? Will you?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.326
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.931
Jim: Where are the beers?
Ellen: In the fridge!

12:12.933 --> 12:14.933
Jim: No, I'm in the fridge here.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.234
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I got 'em. I got 'em.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.802
Thank you.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.942
- You a pilot?
- Um... Here you go.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.677
- I-- I used to be.
- Good.

12:25.679 --> 12:26.911
You know, it's been a long time

12:26.913 --> 12:29.347
since I got my hands dirty.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.949
Well, I mean, you know,
if it's in the blood

12:30.951 --> 12:33.685
it's in the blood.

12:33.687 --> 12:36.054
Ha, John DeLorean!

12:36.056 --> 12:39.557
In my house?
It's something else.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.593
Uh, so, I mean, what are you...
What are you doing now?

12:41.595 --> 12:43.962
You-- you still over
at the GM, yeah?

12:43.964 --> 12:46.698
No, I got out of that racket.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.234
Now, I'm working on something
for myself.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.403
Um. Nice. Nice. Good for you.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.606
What, um, may I ask, um...

12:54.608 --> 12:57.008
She still doesn't sound right.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.780
So what, they,
they won't let you

13:01.782 --> 13:03.615
do your own thing
over a Pontiac?

13:03.617 --> 13:05.984
Oh, Christ, no. General Motors.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.119
Ford. Chrysler.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.155
There's hasn't been a single
honest to God innovation

13:10.157 --> 13:12.590
in 20 years,
all they do is tinker.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.992
They'll, uh,

13:13.994 --> 13:16.227
smooth a corner
or automate a wiper

13:16.229 --> 13:18.496
and hype it as
some great new model.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.765
Oh! Oh-oh.
Better get that.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.735
- But it's all just bullshit.
- Oh, where are you?

13:23.737 --> 13:26.070
Oh, here it is.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.439
Ah! Shit! Shh!

13:28.441 --> 13:29.808
- You alright?
- Yeah.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.944
I cut myself.
Fucking rust bucket.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.013
Take this.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.514
Oh. Thanks.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.149
I think you'll live.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.619
John: Rust.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.354
Every car in America is dying

13:43.356 --> 13:46.157
the minute
it leaves the factory.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.660
But my car...

13:48.662 --> 13:50.929
now my car is...

13:52.966 --> 13:58.002
My car will be made of
brushed stainless steel.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.871
Rear mounted engine.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.507
The underbody will be
made of two large molded parts.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.843
uh, the frame and the body are
one and it's made of

14:04.845 --> 14:07.846
of stainless steel, you see,
so, it'll last forever.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.347
It'll be safest car on the road.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.982
- Mm.
- And, um, and airbags, Jim.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.151
- Do you know about airbags?
- Uh, no.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.620
I want this car
under 2200 pounds.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.021
0 to 60 in 8 seconds.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.323
20 miles per gallon
in the city,

14:18.325 --> 14:20.191
30 miles per gallon
on the highway.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.728
I want a suspension system
that is designed by a computer.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.030
And the doors, Jim...

14:27.033 --> 14:28.867
The doors... Heh.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.538
- They're gull-winged.
- Oh, yeah.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.340
- Right?
- Look at this, they're some...

14:35.342 --> 14:37.408
Oh, sorry, um...

14:37.410 --> 14:39.177
Yeah, it's like science fiction
or something.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.812
It's the future.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.480
- They lift straight up.
- Oh.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.216
Right? You can park it
almost anywhere.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.318
It's more expensive 'cause
you've got to counter balance it

14:47.320 --> 14:48.887
against gravity,
but it's worth it.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.688
Sure, sure, so, you just
kinda come up with, like, uh

14:50.690 --> 14:53.424
an affordable
anti-gravity device.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.626
And, uh...

14:56.062 --> 14:57.729
I-- I-- I don't know
what I'm talking about.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.163
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha...

14:59.165 --> 15:02.433
- Well, just you wait.
- Oh, yeah. He-he.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.269
So what are you you doing
on Friday?

15:04.271 --> 15:06.537
[instrumental music]

15:06.539 --> 15:09.774
So, guess what? We got invited
to a party on Friday.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.042
- Oh.
- Yeah.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.578
So why don't you...

15:13.580 --> 15:15.113
Um, yeah, get your hair done.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.617
- Whatever you say, Rockefeller.
Jim: Ha-ha.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.722
¶ Let your body go
you know you can do it ¶

15:24.724 --> 15:29.060
¶ Like me ee meenie minie mo
there's really nothin' to it ¶

15:29.062 --> 15:33.031
¶ Dance let your body go
you know you can do it ¶

15:33.033 --> 15:37.468
¶ Like me ee meenie minie mo
there's really nothin' to it ¶

15:37.470 --> 15:39.804
¶ You can do it
and you know... ¶¶

15:39.806 --> 15:42.774
- Hey. How's it hangin', Ben?
- Don't call me Ben.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.375
Benedict: I'm Special Agent.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.779
Special Agent. Okay.

15:47.781 --> 15:51.115
You don't make your wife
call you that at home, do you?

15:51.117 --> 15:53.952
You really wanna talk wives,
Jim?

15:53.954 --> 15:55.486
I don't know why you bother
with the charade,

15:55.488 --> 15:57.088
it'd be a lot less stress
if you just told her

15:57.090 --> 15:59.457
what you're really doing
to pay the bills.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.327
What doesn't pay the bills,
Special Agent?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.928
Well, it's your choice
if you want to live high end

16:03.930 --> 16:05.997
on the pay of a low end snitch.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.073
I'm not a snitch, you know?

16:15.075 --> 16:17.442
I'm a paid employee
of the United States government.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.077
That's what I said.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.845
- Just coffee, thanks.
- Okay.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.348
Um, I'll take
half a grapefruit please.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.582
And the smallest scone
you got.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.817
Alright.

16:27.921 --> 16:29.854
So, what's it been, Jim?
A couple of months?

16:29.856 --> 16:30.989
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.123
Yeah. Settling in alright?

16:32.125 --> 16:33.524
You-- you like the house okay?

16:33.526 --> 16:35.326
- Oh, I love the house.
- Kids happy in school?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.695
Uh, I mean, as happy as any kid
during school, right?.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.163
Getting along
with the neighbors okay?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.798
Oh, yeah, getting along great.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.133
You know John DeLorean
actually lives on our block.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.668
- All sounds pretty idyllic.
- Yeah?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.436
Yeah. No, it is.
It's pretty idyllic.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.638
Do you think something's missing
missing from this equation now?

16:47.640 --> 16:50.141
Something a little...
imbalanced?

16:50.143 --> 16:52.276
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe. I...

16:52.278 --> 16:53.878
Maybe? Listen.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.280
We're not in the business
of arresting

16:56.282 --> 16:58.483
every street corner dealer
that catches your eye.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.218
We've got bigger fish to fry.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.953
Uh, no. No, no, no. Hey, look.

17:01.955 --> 17:04.222
I told ya, I can't go there,
okay? The guy'll kill me.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.457
Well, there's two versions
of the Morgan Hetrick story.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.126
Version one, he's your pal,

17:08.128 --> 17:09.660
and yet he sent you to Bolivia

17:09.662 --> 17:12.330
and he hid a shitload of coke
in your plane.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.965
Or you're in cahoots.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.803
Your buddy organizes more
flights than Pan-Am.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.272
He flies in half the coke
that comes into California.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.709
Your buddy, Morgan Hetrick,
has millions

17:24.711 --> 17:26.844
sitting in the Cayman Islands
he can't access

17:26.846 --> 17:28.212
and we'd like to get
our hands on it.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.914
So, you have a choice.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.750
You work with us on this,

17:32.752 --> 17:35.119
we bring him in, you go free.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.655
You say no,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.857
we fuck you out
of your nice house,

17:39.859 --> 17:41.359
you go to prison,

17:41.361 --> 17:43.094
your wife goes to prison

17:43.096 --> 17:44.862
as an accessory

17:44.864 --> 17:47.265
and your kids go in
to the system.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.367
[dramatic music]

17:49.369 --> 17:51.436
Actually, you don't have
a choice.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.453
¶ I'm lucky so lucky ¶

18:08.455 --> 18:09.720
Jim: Boy, look at this place.

18:09.722 --> 18:10.855
How is this house across

18:10.857 --> 18:11.856
the street from our house?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.858
Hi...

18:13.860 --> 18:16.027
- Well, not bad.
- Jim.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.628
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.030
- Good. How are you?
- Oh.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.398
- Great.
- Heh-heh.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
Hi, I'm Cristina,
I'm John's wife.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.901
- Ellen.
- So great to meet you.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.570
You look so lovely.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.138
Well, let me introduce you.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.940
- Come on.
- Okay. Um...

18:30.210 --> 18:32.944
- Ladies, this is Ellen.
- Hi.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.946
Ellen's Jim
is in the airline business.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.314
- Oh, neat.
- Yes.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.915
We just moved in
across the street.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.550
- Oh.
- Oh, lovely.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.752
- Hi. Uh, can I get a drink?
Man 7: Yes, sir.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.822
Um, whiskey on the rocks,
please.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.391
[indistinct chatter]

18:47.393 --> 18:48.826
Bill: Ladies and gentlemen!

18:48.828 --> 18:51.062
Come out of the bar!

18:51.064 --> 18:53.464
Come out of the half rooms.
Gather around.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.933
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce you

18:55.935 --> 18:58.636
to a man who needs
no introduction.

18:58.638 --> 19:02.006
The most successful
auto executive in living memory.

19:02.008 --> 19:05.243
The youngest ever, head of
a division at General Motors

19:05.245 --> 19:07.612
and now founder
of the DeLorean Motor Company,

19:07.614 --> 19:10.248
I give you Mr. John DeLorean.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.316
- Thank you.
- Glad to meet you.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.651
It's good to see you here.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.253
Oh, hey, thank you so much.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.255
Well, thank you, Bill.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.323
Thank you, all. Um...

19:19.325 --> 19:21.492
Boy, it's lovely
to see you all here,

19:21.494 --> 19:24.462
um, but you know there's no
such thing as a free beer...

19:24.464 --> 19:26.130
[laughter]

19:26.132 --> 19:27.498
So you'll have to listen to me

19:27.500 --> 19:29.100
bang the drum for our new car.

19:29.102 --> 19:30.501
[laughter]

19:30.503 --> 19:33.137
I know some of you
haven't signed up yet,

19:33.139 --> 19:35.106
and I wanted to show you
something I received

19:35.108 --> 19:36.774
in the mail today.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.676
- It's a check...
- Ooh.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.113
From a new investor
for $600,000.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.848
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.817
And, uh, what's the name
on that check?

19:46.819 --> 19:48.452
It's a Mr. Johnny Carson.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.421
[cheering]

19:52.825 --> 19:55.393
And that's all well and good,
but I...

19:55.395 --> 19:58.129
You know I wanted
to get serious for a minute.

19:58.131 --> 20:00.298
In the America I grew up in,

20:00.300 --> 20:03.868
a man was defined
by the work he did.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.804
But there was precious
little work to be had.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.339
Very few opportunities.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.174
[instrumental music]

20:10.176 --> 20:12.910
But that didn't stop me
from dreaming.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.414
My father,

20:16.416 --> 20:18.316
oh, he knew hard times.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.585
But he was a smart man.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.653
He said, "It's okay to dream

20:22.655 --> 20:25.156
as long as you combine
those dreams

20:25.158 --> 20:27.325
with hard work."

20:27.327 --> 20:29.493
When I was 14,

20:29.495 --> 20:31.662
he bought this battered down,
old Chevy

20:31.664 --> 20:34.198
and took it apart
into 500 pieces

20:34.200 --> 20:36.200
on our front lawn.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.669
He said, "Son,

20:38.671 --> 20:41.772
if you can put that car
back together, then it's yours."

20:43.209 --> 20:46.210
And that's exactly what I did.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.346
Three days and nights
it took me.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.515
I didn't eat or sleep,
but I did it.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.219
And when it was done...

20:55.221 --> 20:58.389
that car drove like a dream.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.425
And that is my intention
with the DeLorean motorcar,

21:01.427 --> 21:04.295
to build a dream car,

21:04.297 --> 21:08.799
something the great American
public can aspire to owning.

21:08.801 --> 21:12.203
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my
great pleasure to present to you

21:12.205 --> 21:15.439
the latest design
for the DeLorean motor car.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.774
Uh, Roy, Bill.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.143
[dramatic music]

21:19.145 --> 21:20.544
[crowd gasping]

21:20.546 --> 21:22.513
[cheering]

21:24.050 --> 21:25.316
[all gasping]

21:25.318 --> 21:27.952
[cheering]

21:27.954 --> 21:29.754
We're going to design a car,

21:29.756 --> 21:31.489
we're going to build a factory,

21:31.491 --> 21:34.625
we are going
to create 2000 jobs,

21:34.627 --> 21:37.728
we are going to produce
30,000 cars a year

21:37.730 --> 21:41.565
and we are going to do it all
in 18 months.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.801
If you haven't signed up yet,

21:43.803 --> 21:46.671
what are you waiting for?

21:46.673 --> 21:49.473
[cheering]

21:49.475 --> 21:50.808
- Nice job.
- Roy.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.078
You know that's so amazing...

21:54.080 --> 21:55.713
Everybody... [chuckles]

21:58.818 --> 22:00.184
You really think
he can pull this off?

22:00.186 --> 22:02.586
- Oh, I know he can.
- Yeah?

22:02.588 --> 22:03.688
How long you been working
with him?

22:03.690 --> 22:05.156
Since the very beginning.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.457
John: Hey, good to see you.
Good to see you.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.692
I want you take a look
at that car.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.461
It's a good looking car.
Thank you.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.430
[instrumental music]

22:20.139 --> 22:23.107
[inhales deeply]

22:23.810 --> 22:25.543
[sighs]

22:25.545 --> 22:28.546
¶ Tu-ru-rut tu tu-ru ¶

22:28.548 --> 22:31.349

22:31.351 --> 22:33.651

22:37.357 --> 22:39.123
[both chuckle]

22:40.827 --> 22:43.027
Uh, what do you say we go home
and see what happens?

22:43.029 --> 22:44.628
Yeah, it's starting to rain
in here.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.031
Mm-hm.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.666
- It's the DeLoreans.
- Okay, okay.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.234
[clears throat]

22:50.236 --> 22:52.136
Thank you so much
for a lovely evening.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.705
Oh, thank you. It was lovely
to finally have you over.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.374
- It's a beautiful house.
- Oh, thanks.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.875
- Really. Absolutely.
- Jim, right?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.643
- Yes, sir.
- Bill Mercer.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.646
Vice president of whatever
the fuck he has me doing next.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.548
- That's my wife, Ellen.
- Hi.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.816
Why don't you
join us downstairs?

23:05.818 --> 23:06.917
We're just lettin'
our hair down,

23:06.919 --> 23:08.152
now that the pressure's off.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.720
Oh, yeah. Uh-- uh,
that'd be great.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.089
- You're okay with that, right?
- Yeah, fine.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.324
I'll see you tonight.

23:13.326 --> 23:16.026
[chuckling]

23:16.028 --> 23:18.896
That husband of yours
is quite the charmer.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.765
Only until you get to know him.

23:20.767 --> 23:24.034
After tonight,
we have 175 dealers signed up.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.936
That's $25,000 each,

23:25.938 --> 23:28.572
plus a commitment to take
100 cars in the first year.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.608
It needs to be 250, 300.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.476
We'll get there, John.
It's a done deal.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.782
- Nice shot.
- He-he-he.

23:39.352 --> 23:41.118
You serve.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.753
What so funny?

23:42.755 --> 23:46.557
Guys, I've been around,
I know when I'm being pitched.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.393
Uh-- uh, look, I-- I-- I know
I'm living in a nice house

23:49.395 --> 23:51.262
in a swanky neighborhood,
but, uh,

23:51.264 --> 23:53.197
I'm behind on the rent
and I don't know

23:53.199 --> 23:54.865
where next month's is coming
from, so if you're looking

23:54.867 --> 23:57.268
for an investment from me,
you might be, uh...

23:57.270 --> 23:58.702
Well, you're barking
up the wrong tree.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.871
[tapping bat]

24:00.873 --> 24:02.373
Well, fuck you then. [chuckles]

24:03.476 --> 24:04.775
[chuckles]

24:04.777 --> 24:06.777
[indistinct chatter on TV]

24:13.386 --> 24:15.453
[all laughing]

24:17.890 --> 24:21.091
If you're runnin' low on cash,
maybe you'd like to earn some.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.961
- Ooh. Ooh-ooh.
- Oh?

24:23.963 --> 24:28.098
Sure, I'm always up
for a little table tennis.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.401
You mean, ping-pong?

24:30.403 --> 24:32.403
Yeah. I call it table tennis.

24:32.405 --> 24:33.804
Jim, it's ping-pong.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.941
Alright.

24:36.943 --> 24:40.077
Alright, 50 bucks if you can
take a point off me.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.446
Hmm, I believe I might be

24:42.448 --> 24:45.182
getting hustled here, sir, huh?

24:45.184 --> 24:46.750
How do you hold this thing?
Is this right?

24:46.752 --> 24:48.486
- Yeah, exactly like that.
- Am I doing this right?

24:48.488 --> 24:50.488
Stop fuckin' around, come on.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.256
Bill: Alright, John.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.657
Alright.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.660
[ball clacking]

25:06.439 --> 25:07.838
Ooh!

25:14.113 --> 25:15.980
[instrumental music]

25:15.982 --> 25:17.448
Uh-oh.

25:21.687 --> 25:25.055
Oh, no, John, John, come on.
Don't worry about it.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.158
I mean, hell,
it's only table tennis, right?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.361
Let me walk you out.

25:32.331 --> 25:35.032
You know, Jim, I'm sorry
you're havin' a hard time.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.035
And if there's anything I can do
to help, you let me know.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.504
Oh, yeah. No, I mean,
I got a few things cookin'.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.039
But, uh, I mean,
it should all work out,

25:42.041 --> 25:43.641
but thank you for the thought.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.743
Ah, that's what friends are for.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.144
Yeah.

25:49.882 --> 25:53.083
You know,
the thing about ping-pong...

25:53.085 --> 25:54.885
When the game
first came to America

25:54.887 --> 25:57.021
it was trademarked ping-pong
by these guys,

25:57.023 --> 25:58.489
the Parker Brothers.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.991
And they kept a strict control
over that name,

26:00.993 --> 26:03.894
but it still made it
into the lexicon.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.563
It's not a car.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.565
It's not a sports car.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.401
It's a DeLorean.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.037
Hmm.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.672
Yeah.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.640
You don't hang out much,
do you?

26:17.577 --> 26:19.009
Well, uh...

26:19.011 --> 26:21.445
[chuckles]

26:21.447 --> 26:23.013
- I travel a lot. I do.
- Yeah.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.582
Hey, speakin' of which,
do you want me

26:24.584 --> 26:26.884
to keep an eye on the house
when you guys are gone?

26:26.886 --> 26:28.552
You know,
like clean the pool or...

26:28.554 --> 26:30.087
This area probably
turns into a jungle--

26:30.089 --> 26:32.456
Well, that would be, um...

26:32.458 --> 26:34.291
Alright, I-- I can arrange
payment.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.960
No, no, John, John, come on.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.394
You don't have to pay me.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.196
Really. It's okay.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.398
Thank you, Jim.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.934
Hey, that's what
friends are for.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.540
I'm kidding, come here.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.543
There it is.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.080
Friends hug.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.716
Alright, uh, please tell
Cristina thank you

26:58.718 --> 27:00.050
from both me and Ellen.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.290
[instrumental music]

27:18.170 --> 27:20.004
Check, check, check.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.917
<i> Jim: Hi, I was looking</i>
<i> for Morgan.</i>

27:33.919 --> 27:36.887
- Who wants to know?
- Jim. Jim Hoffman.

27:37.757 --> 27:38.756
I'll go check.

27:40.593 --> 27:42.526
[recorder malfunctioning]
Check, check, check, check...

27:42.528 --> 27:43.827
What?

27:43.829 --> 27:45.696
- What's that?
- Check.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.198
Please go check, yeah.
Thank you.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.233
Alright.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.107
[dramatic music]

28:06.686 --> 28:08.652
[clears throat]

28:08.654 --> 28:10.954
- He says, come on in.
- Oh, well, I mean, you know...

28:10.956 --> 28:12.489
If he's busy, I can always come
back another time.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.957
Morgan: Get in here!

28:13.959 --> 28:15.359
Okay, yeah.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.568
Jim Hoffman.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.339
Hey, Morgan, hi.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.809
- Long time, Jim.
- Uh, the place looks great.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.077
You know, so do you.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.513
Um, so, you still flyin'?

28:36.515 --> 28:38.716
Where's my three million bucks?

28:38.718 --> 28:40.918
Come on, Morgan,
we talked about this, okay?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.520
- You know what happened.
- Well, I thought I did.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.723
- And then you disappeared.
- I... No, I... No.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.192
No, I didn't disappear.
No, no, I-- I just, you know,

28:48.194 --> 28:50.260
I had to lie low for a while.
But I'm not hiding.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.663
I wasn't, you know.
We're in the phonebook.

28:52.665 --> 28:54.832
So, it's, yeah,
at least had to

28:54.834 --> 28:57.401
go straight, you know for the...
for the family, so...

28:57.403 --> 28:59.069
I'm-- I'm now doing some
consulting work

28:59.071 --> 29:00.437
now with John DeLorean.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.106
You know, the car guy?

29:02.108 --> 29:04.408
So, he's makin'
this amazing car.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.410
It's a car... It's got wings.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.178
A flying car?

29:08.180 --> 29:10.581
No, I mean, it doesn't fly,
you know it's just that--

29:10.583 --> 29:12.750
- A flying car that doesn't fly.
- Yeah.

29:12.752 --> 29:16.019
Sound like a sure fire fucking
hit to me, Jim!

29:16.021 --> 29:19.223
Jim: Yeah, I know it's a littl--
- A flying car?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.558
- That doesn't fuckin' fly.
- What're you doin', Morgan?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.794
- Come on.
- What do you think, Katy? Huh?

29:23.796 --> 29:26.096
I should just whack
this motherfucker?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.598
Sure, why not?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.233
- Come on, man...
- Hey, wait, Morgan. Stop.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.901
- Calm down, okay.
- Calm down?

29:30.903 --> 29:32.536
- Yeah, I'm your friend.
- You're my friend?

29:32.538 --> 29:34.238
- Yeah! I was at your wedding.
- You know what?

29:34.240 --> 29:36.206
My ex-wife
was at my wedding, Jim.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.875
She fucked me over, too!

29:37.877 --> 29:39.643
- Okay, that's a bad example.
- That is a bad example.

29:39.645 --> 29:40.978
I'm gonna bash
your fuckin' head in.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.079
Jim: Come on, Morgan, stop it.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.380
- Stop it?
- Yeah.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.481
What the fuck
are you doin' here, Jim?

29:44.483 --> 29:46.283
The FBI!

29:49.488 --> 29:50.554
Okay?

29:50.556 --> 29:51.755
They came to talk to me.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.390
They're askin' questions
about you.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.726
- FBI? What kind of questions?
- Yeah.

29:55.728 --> 29:57.461
Like, how we met,
how long we know each other--

29:57.463 --> 29:58.562
Morgan: And what did you
fuckin' tell them, Jim?

29:58.564 --> 30:00.097
I told them the truth, okay?

30:00.099 --> 30:01.899
- You told them the truth?
- Well, not everything.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.001
Obviously, but, come on, Morgan,
look, look, look, look, look.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.502
I may be many things, okay?

30:05.504 --> 30:07.504
But I'm not a snitch.

30:10.743 --> 30:13.243
[instrumental music]

30:13.245 --> 30:15.712
[indistinct chatter]

30:24.690 --> 30:27.157
[grunting]

30:28.961 --> 30:30.594
[clears throat]

30:35.701 --> 30:37.100
Forgetting something?

30:38.504 --> 30:40.504
Oh! You're right, I'm sorry.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.206
Hi, how are you?

30:42.208 --> 30:43.640
Tape, the fucking tape.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.442
The tape, yes, right.
Uh, I dumped it.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.978
I dumped it.
I had to dump it.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.379
- You dumped it?
- Yeah, the tape, the wire.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.348
The whole thing,
I-- I-- I got rid of it.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.050
- You dumped it where?
- In the trash.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.284
But, no, no, no.
It's fine. It's okay.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.319
Don't worry. It's good.
It's fine.

30:55.321 --> 30:56.520
- It's fine?
- Yeah.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.654
So he just goes to take out

30:57.656 --> 30:59.389
the trash and he finds it.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.725
And then it just fucks our whole
operation, but it's fine.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.460
I got nervous.
I'm not Mr. Fuckin' Superspy.

31:03.462 --> 31:04.962
- Jesus Christ, Jim.
- Okay, okay.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.130
But, hey, at least
he and I are talking now.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.565
That's a good thing.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.167
I mean, we discussed,
the-- the, uh, money

31:10.169 --> 31:11.902
in the Cayman's
and how to access it.

31:11.904 --> 31:14.705
But we only have your word
for it and that's worth shit.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.673
Look, from now on,

31:16.675 --> 31:19.042
every time you see that fucker
you're wearing a wire.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.143
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.145
Wh-- which I, you know,

31:22.147 --> 31:23.480
I could say brings me
to my second issue.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.082
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.583
Hey, look, hey, hold on, okay,
look, I realize that

31:26.585 --> 31:27.718
you and I, we have never, uh...

31:27.720 --> 31:29.319
We never discussed about my, uh,

31:29.321 --> 31:31.255
you know, my cut.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.522
- Your cut?
- Yeah, my cut.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.825
My, you know, my percentage.

31:34.827 --> 31:37.928
Look, man, Morgan finds out
what I'm doing, I'm a dead man.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.731
It's only fair
that I'm, you know, entitled to

31:40.733 --> 31:43.066
a little piece of whatever
you recoup from him, right?

31:43.068 --> 31:44.935
You know what, just maybe
a little tiny piece.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.404
You know, something like, um...

31:47.406 --> 31:49.072
Well, I don't know what's fair.
Ten percent? Ten percent?

31:49.074 --> 31:51.341
- Hm. Alright.
- A little. Yeah. Just a sliver.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.343
- Entitled?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.711
Well, you see it's pretty
simple, Jim.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.747
We have a way of working
these things out.

31:56.749 --> 32:00.550
You get ten percent
of suck my fucking dick!

32:00.552 --> 32:03.253
You're already
a paid government informant.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.522
- Am I? Barely I would say. I--
- Jim.

32:05.524 --> 32:06.857
- What?
- Must I remind you?

32:06.859 --> 32:08.091
I'm the only thing

32:08.093 --> 32:11.094
standing between you and prison.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.931
Your job is to hook
Morgan Hetrick.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.766
Is he hooked?
Isn't that why I'm here?

32:15.768 --> 32:17.634
'Cause the last I checked,
he was in the Cayman Islands

32:17.636 --> 32:18.902
countin' his fuckin' money.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.203
I told you it was gonna take...

32:20.205 --> 32:21.271
It's gonna take a little time

32:21.273 --> 32:22.739
for me to earn back his trust.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.107
I think you've been
spending so much time

32:24.109 --> 32:25.475
partying with John DeLorean,
you forgot

32:25.477 --> 32:26.910
what you're supposed
to be doing here.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.146
I need less champagne...

32:29.148 --> 32:31.248
- More cocaine.
- That's clever, you know.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.417
And if you've got some sort of
misplaced loyalty

32:33.419 --> 32:35.585
to Morgan or you think
you're protecting your family

32:35.587 --> 32:38.555
by fucking this shit up,
you're sadly fuckin' mistaken.

32:38.557 --> 32:39.923
The next time you call me,

32:39.925 --> 32:41.224
it better be
for a good fuckin' reason.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.626
Ten fuckin' percent?

32:42.628 --> 32:46.396
The FBI will never ever
pay you ten percent.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.032
You owe us. We don't owe you.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.804
Your next check
is gonna be short a 126 bucks,

32:53.806 --> 32:56.340
because that's how much
those wires cost.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.508
Hey.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.711
I could probably get you a
better deal on those, you know?

33:08.153 --> 33:10.654
[upbeat music]

33:11.790 --> 33:13.991
[children shouting]

33:19.965 --> 33:21.999
Hey, that's a groovy little
camera you got.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.467
- Hello.
- Betamax, man.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.202
Uh-huh.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.703
Any money you're not putting
into DeLorean,

33:26.705 --> 33:28.005
put it into Betamax.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.406
What money?

33:31.977 --> 33:33.844
I don't know
why she bothers with him.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.648
You know, he's chained
by a grandmaster.

33:38.650 --> 33:39.883
Really?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.619
Oh.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.964
James Hoffman.
What is that German?

33:53.966 --> 33:55.399
Yeah, I guess so.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.667
You know, Jim,
everything is out there.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.302
It just takes a bit of leg work.

33:59.304 --> 34:00.470
But that's what I do.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.908
I gotta say,
most people are kinda straight.

34:04.910 --> 34:07.344
But every once in a while,
you come up against someone

34:07.346 --> 34:10.047
who's just 90% bullshit.

34:11.016 --> 34:12.582
Wants to hitch a ride.

34:14.086 --> 34:16.853
The thing is, I haven't been
able to turn up

34:16.855 --> 34:18.288
anything about you at all.

34:20.025 --> 34:21.258
That worries me.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.395
Yeah, that worries me too,
actually.

34:26.031 --> 34:27.464
Oh.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.835
- Hey, Ellen.
- Yeah?

34:31.837 --> 34:34.838
Roy here thinks
I'm 90% bullshit.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.006
Ninety?

34:36.008 --> 34:38.909
[chuckles]

34:38.911 --> 34:41.912
Howard: James D'Jong.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.014
Or is it D'Yong?

34:44.016 --> 34:48.085
- This is your birth name?
- Mm-hmm.

34:48.087 --> 34:52.889
Is your wife even aware
that you are James D'Jong?

34:52.891 --> 34:54.391
I mean, I think so. I-- I...

34:54.393 --> 34:57.294
I actually don't know
if it's ever come up.

34:57.296 --> 35:00.730
And what about Mr. DeLorean,
was he aware of your real name?

35:00.732 --> 35:02.632
Your checkered history?

35:02.634 --> 35:04.534
- I believe he was.
- You believe?

35:04.536 --> 35:07.971
- You-- you discussed it?
James: No, but I alluded to it.

35:07.973 --> 35:10.407
One of his executives
had me background checked.

35:10.409 --> 35:13.610
Background check on a man
who has no criminal history,

35:13.612 --> 35:15.278
never spent a night in prison,

35:15.280 --> 35:18.315
has only filed one
somewhat suspect tax return

35:18.317 --> 35:19.983
in the last ten years?

35:19.985 --> 35:22.385
What background was there
to check?

35:22.387 --> 35:24.754
James D'jong on the other
hand...

35:24.756 --> 35:29.326
Well, one can see why you might
wanna change your name.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.294
Hmm.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.402
Oh, don't worry about him.

35:39.404 --> 35:43.240
He's just antsy because
we're stalled on the money.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.341
What're you talkin' about?
I thought you guys were

35:44.343 --> 35:45.642
signin' 'em up left and right.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.910
Not gonna raise 90 million

35:46.912 --> 35:49.913
with penny antique
car dealerships.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.582
GM thinks they've created
a monster and it scares them.

35:54.186 --> 35:57.087
If Detroit is scared of you,
so is corporate America.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.025
The fact is, I don't think
I've got a chance in hell

36:02.027 --> 36:04.027
of raising 90 million.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.297
So take it somewhere else.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.599
Just like that, right?

36:09.601 --> 36:11.001
I'm being serious.

36:12.704 --> 36:13.837
Look, John...

36:15.707 --> 36:18.041
Roy digs deep enough

36:18.043 --> 36:20.177
he's probably gonna find
something you're not gonna like.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.481
Truth is, I've flown

36:24.483 --> 36:26.883
all kinds of shit
all over the world.

36:26.885 --> 36:30.887
Bangkok, Bolivia...
There're all types of people.

36:32.991 --> 36:36.393
The one thing I've learned is
that there is a deal to be made

36:36.395 --> 36:38.461
everywhere, always.

36:40.199 --> 36:42.332
Right now we might be livin' in,

36:42.334 --> 36:44.167
oh, sad cynical times,

36:44.169 --> 36:47.270
but you're the goddamn
American dream, man.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.808
People around the world
love that shit.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.477
So I say, you know,
they don't love you here...

36:54.479 --> 36:56.413
just, uh, take it
somewhere they will.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.448
Bring the American dream
to them.

37:03.755 --> 37:07.657
It's an entire Atlantic ocean
away from your primary market

37:07.659 --> 37:10.594
and it's in the middle
of a fucking warzone.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.895
Do you know
how many people were killed

37:11.897 --> 37:15.565
in Northern Ireland last year?
Ninety.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.235
Do you know how many people
were murdered in Detroit?

37:18.237 --> 37:19.669
Nine hundred!

37:19.671 --> 37:20.870
Do the fucking math.

37:20.872 --> 37:23.573
You'd be starting from scratch.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.543
The last thing they built
was the Titanic.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.745
Man on TV: It's
John DeLorean's new sports car,

37:28.747 --> 37:30.413
the DMC12.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.415
Thirty thousand a year,
the production target

37:32.417 --> 37:34.384
for the Northern Ireland plant,

37:34.386 --> 37:37.687
with the first cars
to go to dealers this fall.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.055
Oh! What's wrong?

37:39.057 --> 37:41.057
Is your little buddy
in a faraway land

37:41.059 --> 37:43.360
and can't come out and play?

37:43.362 --> 37:45.228
Mm-hmm.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.230
It think it's cute how you
always gets sad

37:47.232 --> 37:48.531
when he's out of town.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.033
Oh, come on.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.301
Man on TV: The British
government spent

37:51.303 --> 37:54.104
$120 million
for the plant.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.773
For John DeLorean,
it's the realization of a dream

37:56.775 --> 37:59.876
that started a long time ago.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.811
<i> Howard: So for 18 months,</i>

38:01.813 --> 38:06.082
while John DeLorean
was building his factory

38:06.084 --> 38:10.387
providing jobs, helping bring
peace to a blighted country

38:10.389 --> 38:12.255
you barely heard from.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.324
No, you're not understanding
what I'm saying, okay?

38:14.326 --> 38:16.893
Look, we'll... I will set up
the meeting, okay?

38:16.895 --> 38:18.261
<i> Jim: Well, I was tryin' to get</i>

38:18.263 --> 38:19.729
<i> Morgan Hetrick to part</i>
<i> with his money.</i>

38:19.731 --> 38:21.398
If we set up a meeting,
you probably will.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.632
See, she's smart.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.067
Look, are you gonna
call him or not?

38:24.069 --> 38:25.835
Morgan: I'm on it. Alright?

38:25.837 --> 38:27.470
The Dayglow Bank. [laughs]

38:30.575 --> 38:35.445
<i> Howard: For 18 months, that is</i>
<i> a... that is a very long time.</i>

38:35.447 --> 38:36.746
<i> Jim: Yeah, well, he had three</i>
<i> million reasons</i>

38:36.748 --> 38:37.814
<i> not to trust me.</i>

38:41.186 --> 38:45.021
Mr. Hoffman, we've heard of your
escapades in the drug business.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.756
Yet, no jail time.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.926
We've heard of your dealings
with nefarious criminals,

38:49.928 --> 38:52.128
yet still alive
to tell the tale.

38:52.130 --> 38:55.165
Mr. Hoffman, it must be said

38:55.167 --> 38:57.600
you live a charmed life.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.202
Not sure my wife would agree
with you.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.373
We never seem to really get
ahead of ourselves, you know?

39:03.375 --> 39:05.775
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you'll get there.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.510
Now, just look at John,
one minute

39:07.512 --> 39:09.346
he's tryin'
to sweet talk car dealers.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.981
The next, he's got
this office on Park Avenue.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.617
- Park Avenue.
- Oh, my God, yes.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.119
You should see it.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.687
Marble everywhere.

39:19.391 --> 39:20.523
Marble.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.559
Fuck them and fuck their marble.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.461
What... What're you
talkin' about? Who? Who? Who?

39:24.463 --> 39:25.962
- What's wrong?
- John and Cristina.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.031
It's marble this
and marble that.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.999
- Why don't we have any marble?
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

39:30.001 --> 39:31.501
What are you doing? Come here.
Here, look at me.

39:31.503 --> 39:34.003
Hey, marble's only good
for two things, okay?

39:34.005 --> 39:36.740
Gravestones and marbles.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.308
You do know
marbles aren't made of marble,

39:38.310 --> 39:41.211
they're made of glass.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.579
I don't know that.
I had no idea. I-- I didn't...

39:42.581 --> 39:43.680
I didn't know that.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.382
What would I do without you?

39:45.384 --> 39:47.917
I would run around
sounding like a dipshit.

39:47.919 --> 39:50.053
Hey, look, baby. You know,
you got to realize something.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.821
In the America that I grew up in

39:51.823 --> 39:54.324
a man was defined
by the work that he did.

39:54.326 --> 39:57.093
But it never stopped me
from dreaming, okay?

39:58.697 --> 40:00.363
When I was nine months old,
my daddy

40:00.365 --> 40:02.365
bought me a beat up,
old Chevrolet.

40:02.367 --> 40:05.602
He broke it down
to 42,000 pieces

40:05.604 --> 40:08.605
and I put it together
with my hands and my tool.

40:08.607 --> 40:11.841
My tool! What? What? What?

40:11.843 --> 40:14.811
[instrumental music]

40:21.253 --> 40:23.086
John: I know
it's incredibly complicated,

40:23.088 --> 40:24.554
but you just have to trust me.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.122
Molly: I do trust you,
but then...

40:26.124 --> 40:27.757
you can't move money around
like that.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.059
John: Why not? It's my money.
Molly: No, it's not.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.461
Molly: Christ, John.
If someone finds out--

40:31.463 --> 40:34.097
John: Well, that's why
we're switching...

40:35.133 --> 40:36.366
Jim.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.368
Ellen: Jim!

40:39.438 --> 40:40.637
What?

40:41.640 --> 40:44.207
Ellen: Hurry! Hurry! Quick.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.409
- Jim, come here. Look.
- What's goin' on?

40:46.411 --> 40:48.445
I think it's clear
what's going on.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.081
Jim: Oh, come on.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.783
They work together.

40:53.785 --> 40:54.984
Ellen: Something's going on.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.319
He's just trying
to calm her down.

40:56.321 --> 40:57.954
I-- I don't know
what the big deal is.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.889
Oh, my God, you think
you're so good with people,

40:59.891 --> 41:02.926
but you don't even see when it's
right in front of your face.

41:02.928 --> 41:03.960
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.962
H-- He's so full of shit.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.764
- He cheats at chess.
- How do you know?

41:07.766 --> 41:09.799
- You don't play chess.
- And now this thing with Molly.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.234
Oh, come on, that's bullshit.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.802
John is as straight
as an arrow, he is.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.938
You think that,
but look at his chin.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.573
That's where
the bullshit starts.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.174
Okay, I'm sorry, his chin?

41:18.176 --> 41:19.642
Wh-- what about his chin?

41:19.644 --> 41:21.277
Haven't you ever looked
at those old pictures

41:21.279 --> 41:22.946
hanging in their house?

41:22.948 --> 41:25.515
He has no chin.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.784
Now he has a chin.
Think about it.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.986
- Really?
- Think about...

41:29.988 --> 41:32.322
- Hey, uh, I better go, okay?
- What is that?

41:32.324 --> 41:33.590
What time are you
pickin' up the kids from school?

41:33.592 --> 41:35.024
- Baby! Baby!
- It's a button.

41:35.026 --> 41:37.627
What is that? No, no, no, no!
This... [gasps]

41:37.629 --> 41:39.796
- What the fuck?
- It's just a gadget that...

41:39.798 --> 41:42.098
- Oh, shit! Okay--
- What is going on?

41:42.100 --> 41:43.633
Jim: Let me explain, okay?
I-- I-- I'll explain.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.034
- What's going on?
- It's not a big deal, hon.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.669
Okay, here, look, look, look.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.037
Let's just sit down
and I'll explain everything.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.772
No, no, no, no, no, you sit down

41:49.774 --> 41:51.774
and you tell me
what the fuck?

41:51.776 --> 41:53.042
- Here, it's no big deal--
- Sit!

41:53.044 --> 41:55.979
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, look, I...

41:55.981 --> 41:58.448
Okay, no better way to say it
than just to say it, right?

41:58.450 --> 42:01.217
You know, I can beat around the
bush or sugar coat, I'm gonna--

42:01.219 --> 42:03.052
I'm about to lose
my shit right now.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.521
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

42:04.523 --> 42:06.122
Look, I, um...

42:06.124 --> 42:09.225
I... I work for the FBI.

42:09.227 --> 42:11.194
- You're in the FBI?
- Yes.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.830
I mean, no.
No, I-- I-- I'm not in the FBI.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.832
I-- I work for the FBI.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.734
You know, u-- undercover,
like a spy.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.536
- You're a spy?
- Exactly, yeah. Or no!

42:19.538 --> 42:21.971
No, I'm not a spy. I'm...

42:21.973 --> 42:24.140
They would classify me
as an informant.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.643
But I am part of, you know,
President Reagan's

42:26.645 --> 42:28.645
War on Drugs, so I just
never told you about it,

42:28.647 --> 42:29.712
because I didn't want you
to worry.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.180
I don't understand.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.649
Well, that's because
it's a lot to take in.

42:32.651 --> 42:33.883
No, no, no. I understand
what you're saying.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.184
But I-- I don't understand

42:35.186 --> 42:36.719
what you're fucking saying.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.488
You're in the airplane business.

42:38.490 --> 42:40.690
Well, no, not anymore, but
that's how this all got started.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.559
How long has this been going on?

42:42.561 --> 42:44.494
Ah, six months.
Six months, that's it.

42:44.496 --> 42:46.195
I mean, three years total,
I guess.

42:46.197 --> 42:47.564
Three years?

42:47.566 --> 42:49.265
Mm-hmm, yeah, that's all.

42:49.267 --> 42:51.100
- Three years.
- Mm-hmm.

42:51.102 --> 42:53.269
- Three fucking years?
- Oh, no, no, baby, baby.

42:53.271 --> 42:54.404
- Three fucking years?
- Hey, listen to me.

42:54.406 --> 42:55.872
- You--
- Listen to me.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.774
We moved here to start over.
You promised!

42:57.776 --> 42:59.542
- Hon, we did start over, okay?
- You promised!

42:59.544 --> 43:01.177
- I know, we did.
- You promised me!

43:01.179 --> 43:03.947
Look, it's all incredibly
complicated.

43:03.949 --> 43:06.449
Remember the guy that I told you
about Morgan, Morgan Hetrick?

43:06.451 --> 43:08.618
He's the one that organized
our whole Bolivia trip.

43:08.620 --> 43:10.420
- He set you up.
- Yeah, exactly.

43:10.422 --> 43:13.590
He set me up, okay?
Baby, look, I...

43:13.592 --> 43:15.725
They caught me with a plane load
of cocaine, alright?

43:15.727 --> 43:17.860
They were never gonna
just let me walk away, alright?

43:17.862 --> 43:19.228
I have to give them Morgan,

43:19.230 --> 43:20.563
otherwise
they will send me to prison

43:20.565 --> 43:22.398
for a very, very long time.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.801
Okay, and I know that it must be
very upsetting to you to think

43:24.803 --> 43:27.904
about it, but-- but it is
situation that we are in.

43:27.906 --> 43:29.272
- We?
- Yeah, we.

43:29.274 --> 43:30.573
Why we? What's we?

43:30.575 --> 43:32.208
Because you were on the plane
too.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.743
They've been threatening me
with all sorts of stuff.

43:33.745 --> 43:35.144
You wouldn't even believe it
lately.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.212
What they would do with you or

43:36.214 --> 43:37.580
where they'd send our kids.

43:37.582 --> 43:38.815
- It's overwhelming.
- Oh, my God.

43:38.817 --> 43:39.882
I mean, I feel so good,
I've been living

43:39.884 --> 43:41.150
with this burden for so long,

43:41.152 --> 43:42.819
it feels so good
to finally share it...

43:42.821 --> 43:44.420
- No. Nothing to worry about.
- Oh, my God!

43:44.422 --> 43:46.155
Honey, I'm not happy
about it either, hon.

43:46.157 --> 43:48.257
Look, you really think
I wanna take the government

43:48.259 --> 43:49.292
payin' our fuckin' rent.

43:49.294 --> 43:50.927
They pay our rent?

43:50.929 --> 43:52.895
- Yeah, they pay for everything.
- They pay our rent?

43:52.897 --> 43:54.564
Yeah, but not enough in my
opinion, but that's

43:54.566 --> 43:55.598
a whole separate issue.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.633
I could really use your help

43:56.635 --> 43:57.934
strategizing about it, you know.

43:57.936 --> 43:59.402
Hey, honey,
look, look, look, look!

43:59.404 --> 44:00.837
Once I-- I get through
with this,

44:00.839 --> 44:02.505
then we're home free, alright.

44:02.507 --> 44:04.273
I am doing this for us!

44:04.275 --> 44:05.975
Hell, I'm doing this
for America!

44:05.977 --> 44:08.411
You are delusional!

44:08.413 --> 44:10.747
What the...
We have children.

44:10.749 --> 44:12.682
- What if this-- this-- this...
- What? Who? Morgan?

44:12.684 --> 44:14.517
- Morgan, what if he finds out?
- He won't.

44:14.519 --> 44:15.918
He won't. He's not gonna.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.120
Hon, look, I've actually
found something

44:17.122 --> 44:18.521
that I'm kinda good at.

44:18.523 --> 44:19.756
Fuck you!

44:19.758 --> 44:21.324
Okay, stop. Ellen, stop!

44:21.326 --> 44:22.492
Okay, where-- where
are you goin'?

44:22.494 --> 44:23.993
I'm gonna go and get the kids

44:23.995 --> 44:25.628
and take 'em to my mom.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.030
No, please, don't. Okay,
what do you want me to do?

44:27.032 --> 44:28.297
I'll do anything.
What do you want?

44:28.299 --> 44:31.701
- What do I want you to do?
- Yeah.

44:31.703 --> 44:34.637
I want you to just stop.

44:34.639 --> 44:40.376
Can you please, please
just stop fucking up my life?

44:40.378 --> 44:42.378
Please.

44:42.380 --> 44:45.615
Every time, every time like
a little piece of sunshine

44:45.617 --> 44:48.584
starts to shine, you just come
and you stomp on it.

44:50.055 --> 44:53.990
What if this guy comes
and kills us?

44:53.992 --> 44:56.959

is the most awaited sports car

45:19.484 --> 45:21.384

45:21.386 --> 45:24.821
Drive the DeLorean
and live the dream.

45:24.823 --> 45:25.988
[screaming]

45:31.896 --> 45:33.763
Hey, is this him?

45:33.765 --> 45:36.599
That guy with the flying car?

45:38.002 --> 45:40.703
Yeah, that's him. Yeah.

45:40.705 --> 45:43.406
Looks like your buddy's
flying car's really taken off.

45:43.408 --> 45:45.108
Yeah, you can say that again.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.878
Hey, you should meet him.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.447
- Meet John DeLorean?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

45:51.449 --> 45:53.382
In-- in fact, you know they're
having a party this Saturday.

45:53.384 --> 45:55.184
You guys should go. Yeah?

45:57.522 --> 45:59.789
I gotta make a call.
I'll be right back.

45:59.791 --> 46:01.758
Do you think he would mind?

46:02.961 --> 46:05.128
Morgan. Morgan. Morgan.

46:05.130 --> 46:07.430
Can we party with John DeLorean?

46:07.432 --> 46:09.031
Sure, we can.

It broke down five minutes
from the showroom.

and it broke down again,

48:47.859 --> 48:49.859
There you are.

48:49.861 --> 48:51.861
I hear you're expecting someone.

48:51.863 --> 48:54.630
Oh, yeah, I hope it's okay,
I invited a couple of friends,

48:54.632 --> 48:56.632
you know, I...
People I wanted to...

48:58.736 --> 49:00.603
[chuckles]

49:00.605 --> 49:01.871
Uh...

49:01.873 --> 49:02.872
[giggles]

49:05.109 --> 49:07.243
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:07.245 --> 49:10.079
- Nice to see you.
- You as well.

49:10.081 --> 49:12.882
You know, it's important
for us that our friends, um,

49:12.884 --> 49:16.218
share in our success and we
wanted to give you something

49:16.220 --> 49:19.388
as a, uh, a token
of our friendship.

49:23.828 --> 49:25.294
[cackles]

49:25.296 --> 49:27.830
I will be getting this
in the divorce, anyway.

49:27.832 --> 49:29.231
[all laugh]

49:30.468 --> 49:33.269
¶ Funtime ¶

49:33.271 --> 49:36.973
¶ Strolling
in the sunshine... ¶¶

49:36.975 --> 49:38.441
So, why did you come back?

49:38.443 --> 49:40.242
- The sex.
- Oh!

49:41.946 --> 49:44.914
And I knew what I was getting
into when I married you.

49:46.584 --> 49:48.751
You're not a bad man.

49:48.753 --> 49:50.119
You're just an idiot.

49:50.121 --> 49:51.520
[laughs]

49:54.592 --> 49:58.194
Oh, hell yeah. [chuckles]

49:58.196 --> 50:01.297
Whatever you have to do
just do it,

50:01.299 --> 50:03.032
but finish it.

50:03.034 --> 50:04.266
Okay.

50:07.038 --> 50:09.271
Hey, Morgan! Hi!

50:09.273 --> 50:11.173
I-- I didn't think you guys
were gonna make it.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.142
- Helen. Finally.
- Ellen.

50:13.144 --> 50:16.879
We have heard so much about you.

50:16.881 --> 50:20.116
All lies I'm sure.

50:20.118 --> 50:22.184
I have a migraine,
so I'm gonna go

50:22.186 --> 50:23.953
drive home
and, um, I'll see you later.

50:23.955 --> 50:27.490
Did the FBI suggest you invite
Mr. Hetrick to the party?

50:27.492 --> 50:28.724
No, that would've been my idea.

50:28.726 --> 50:30.192
Okay, why? Wha...

50:30.194 --> 50:33.029
He-- he wasn't an acquaintance
of Mr. DeLorean.

50:33.031 --> 50:34.330
No, sir, not of John.

50:34.332 --> 50:35.564
Come on, uh,
let me introduce you.

50:35.566 --> 50:36.732
Hey, John. John.

50:36.734 --> 50:38.167
I-- I-- I just wanna

50:38.169 --> 50:39.301
introduce you
to a good friend of mine.

50:39.303 --> 50:41.337
This is Morgan Hetrick and Katy.

50:41.339 --> 50:42.805
Well, welcome, welcome.

50:42.807 --> 50:45.074
John, I'm hearing great things
about your car.

50:45.076 --> 50:47.810
What then was the purpose
of inviting a man

50:47.812 --> 50:52.148
who is the subject of a major
FBI investigation

50:52.150 --> 50:53.716
to a social event

50:53.718 --> 50:56.719
w-- with your friend
John DeLorean?

50:56.721 --> 50:58.320
Ah, well, I suppose
in retrospect

50:58.322 --> 51:00.423
I was showing off for Morgan.

51:00.425 --> 51:02.725
At that point, you know,
John was a pretty big deal.

51:02.727 --> 51:04.760
Let me get you some drinks.
Come on.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.266
Cristina.

51:14.338 --> 51:17.206
Why did you bring that man here?

51:17.208 --> 51:18.908
- Who, Morgan?
- Yeah.

51:18.910 --> 51:20.609
- Well, I...
- Yeah, Morgan Hetrick.

51:20.611 --> 51:23.579
He's, he's a drug dealer.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.948
What? He is?

51:25.950 --> 51:27.917
- A-- are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.518
I know him from a long time ago.

51:29.520 --> 51:30.953
You wanted him to think
that you moved

51:30.955 --> 51:32.588
with the movers and the shakers.

51:32.590 --> 51:35.291
- Sure.
- And how'd they get on?

51:35.293 --> 51:37.793
Was this the beginning
of the alleged plot?

51:37.795 --> 51:40.029
No, no, but, um,

51:40.031 --> 51:41.931
Mr. Hetrick certainly
made an impression.

51:41.933 --> 51:43.699
[laughing]

51:43.701 --> 51:47.369
Are you fucking kidding me? This
is the bedroom! Get out of here!

51:47.371 --> 51:49.738
- They're like Ken and Barbie!
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me?

51:49.740 --> 51:51.273
- Hey, put those back right now!
- Oh...

51:51.275 --> 51:53.909
She's just so delicious
and elegant.

51:53.911 --> 51:55.611
We're gonna get out
of this room. Get out.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.947
Come on. Let's go, guys.
It's important. Okay?

51:57.949 --> 52:00.716
It's a... Can you put
the dresses back, please? Okay?

52:00.718 --> 52:03.152
Can you put 'em back? Beautiful
singing voice, alright?

52:03.154 --> 52:05.588
Oh, I would fuck her for sure.

52:05.590 --> 52:08.090
Oh, I know you would, baby.

52:08.092 --> 52:09.291
Come on, let's get out
of here, please?

52:09.293 --> 52:10.559
- Jim, Jim!
- Alright? Please?

52:10.561 --> 52:12.128
He said to make ourselves
at home!

52:12.130 --> 52:13.796
- This is not what he meant...
- No, he didn't.

52:13.798 --> 52:15.598
- But come here.
- What? What're you doing?

52:15.600 --> 52:17.299
- Okay? I...
- It's worth a blowie.

52:17.301 --> 52:18.968
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no.
Clean this up.

52:18.970 --> 52:21.070
- Don't do this in here.
- Oh, this ain't for me, Jim.

52:21.072 --> 52:22.671
- What're you talking about?
- This is for you.

52:22.673 --> 52:25.007
Jim: No, I'm... What? No, no,
no, no. I'm good, okay?

52:25.009 --> 52:27.176
I'm not gonna...
What the fuck are you doing now?

52:27.178 --> 52:28.611
She has so many clothes.

52:28.613 --> 52:30.779
I just, I wanna see
if she even notices.

52:30.781 --> 52:32.681
Yeah, she's gonna notice. Okay?
Please, don't put that dress on.

52:32.683 --> 52:34.150
Morgan: Jim, I insist.

52:34.152 --> 52:35.918
If we are gonna work together,

52:35.920 --> 52:36.952
we gotta be able
to play together.

52:36.954 --> 52:38.354
I'm not gonna do it, okay?

52:38.356 --> 52:39.421
- Jim?
- I'm not gonna do it.

52:39.423 --> 52:40.689
Do it, Jim!

52:40.691 --> 52:42.291
Morgan: Do it!
Katy: Do it!

52:42.293 --> 52:43.859
- Do it! Do it!
- Okay. Okay.

52:43.861 --> 52:45.694
Okay, fine. God, this isn't
funny. I'll do...

52:45.696 --> 52:47.630
I'm gonna do a, just a,
a half a line here.

52:47.632 --> 52:48.664
[sniffs]

52:48.666 --> 52:49.865
- Okay?
- Yes!

52:49.867 --> 52:51.133
Good? Good. Okay?

52:51.135 --> 52:52.468
Can we go now, please?
Everybody?

52:52.470 --> 52:53.602
Let's go.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.204
[Morgan laughs]

52:55.206 --> 52:57.840
Oh, my God. Wh-- wh-- what
is going on right now?

52:59.177 --> 53:01.177
What was that?
What is going on?

53:02.613 --> 53:05.281
- Jim...
- Oh, boy. What?

53:05.283 --> 53:06.949
We'd like to cut in
little angel dust.

53:06.951 --> 53:09.051
- Oh, my God.
Morgan: Dad's a little bad.

53:09.053 --> 53:11.020
Okay, I've noticed.
I really--

53:11.022 --> 53:13.122
- You okay, Jim?
- That's not, that's not funny.

53:13.124 --> 53:15.691
I'm gonna be fine,
but I need you to...

53:17.528 --> 53:19.195
Katy! Hey! Hey!

53:21.899 --> 53:24.667
¶ Boogie no more ¶

53:24.669 --> 53:26.068
¶ Listen to the music ¶

53:26.070 --> 53:27.469
Hey, what you're doing?

53:28.739 --> 53:30.739
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Come on, now!

53:32.910 --> 53:34.910
[music continues]

53:42.220 --> 53:44.587
¶ There's no time to waste ¶

53:44.589 --> 53:47.323

53:47.325 --> 53:48.557
Mm! Mm! [gasps]

53:48.559 --> 53:50.226
Don't touch me!

53:50.228 --> 53:51.627
Yummy!

53:55.366 --> 53:56.732
Shit. Katy!

53:56.734 --> 53:58.067
[squealing]

53:58.069 --> 53:59.568
What the hell
were you thinking...

53:59.570 --> 54:01.270
I know, I know, I just...

54:01.272 --> 54:02.938

¶ Listen to the music and... ¶

54:07.178 --> 54:08.210
[moaning]

54:08.212 --> 54:10.246
She's wearing my dress!

54:10.248 --> 54:12.214
I've got it under control, okay?

54:12.216 --> 54:13.349
It's fine. Don't worry...

54:13.351 --> 54:15.050
Oh!

54:15.052 --> 54:17.086
[cheering]

54:17.088 --> 54:18.120
[laughing]

54:18.122 --> 54:19.288
Whoo!

54:20.925 --> 54:22.925
- Hey, lady?
- Ah! Oh, my...

54:24.929 --> 54:27.129
Now it's party!

54:27.131 --> 54:29.398
[screaming]

54:29.400 --> 54:30.766
Hey! Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.234
Give me your hand.
Get out of the pool.

54:32.236 --> 54:33.535
Hey! Don't do that!

54:33.537 --> 54:35.471
Morgan! Morgan!

54:35.473 --> 54:37.806
- Stop it.
Jim: Morgan!

54:37.808 --> 54:39.408
Are you fucking kidding?

54:39.410 --> 54:41.110
Oh, fuck!

54:41.112 --> 54:42.144
Oh, fuck!

54:42.146 --> 54:43.445
Hey.

54:47.885 --> 54:48.917
Hey. Hey.

54:48.919 --> 54:50.919
[screaming]

54:50.921 --> 54:52.554
[laughing]

54:52.556 --> 54:53.789
Goddamn it!

54:53.791 --> 54:55.824
[laughing]

54:55.826 --> 54:58.294
- I got you!
- I love you, baby!

55:11.275 --> 55:13.175
John and Cristina are pissed.

55:13.177 --> 55:15.244
Whole night was a fucking
nightmare!

55:15.246 --> 55:18.614
The only good thing about it
is that you're back home.

55:18.616 --> 55:20.582
Oh, there's one other
good thing.

55:23.154 --> 55:25.187
[laughing]

55:25.189 --> 55:27.189
Oh, that's right.

55:27.191 --> 55:28.257
Wait...

55:30.194 --> 55:31.827
But where's the key?

55:33.931 --> 55:35.197
What the hell's this?

55:35.199 --> 55:37.032
It's a coupon for 25 percent off

55:37.034 --> 55:39.601
a brand new DeLorean
at our nearest dealer.

55:39.603 --> 55:41.870
- What the fuck?
- What did you think?

55:41.872 --> 55:43.939
He was gonna give you
a brand new car?

55:43.941 --> 55:45.541
Yes! Yeah!

55:45.543 --> 55:47.710
I mean, come on.
The guy's got thousands of 'em.

55:47.712 --> 55:50.612
What... it's a lot better than
this shit.

55:50.614 --> 55:53.882
Mr. Hoffman, did you expect
to benefit financially

55:53.884 --> 55:56.285
from your association
with John DeLorean?

55:56.287 --> 55:57.886
Uh, no, sir.

55:57.888 --> 56:01.623
You didn't repeatedly hint
that a free DeLorean car

56:01.625 --> 56:03.225
might be in order?

56:03.227 --> 56:05.194
- No, sir.
- Why not?

56:05.196 --> 56:07.730
You being such a important
consultant.

56:07.732 --> 56:09.465
Uh, well,
to tell you the truth,

56:09.467 --> 56:10.632
it wasn't a very good car.

56:10.634 --> 56:11.700
[indistinct chatter]

56:11.702 --> 56:13.235
Flattered to deceive.

56:13.237 --> 56:14.970
Jim: Uh, by the time
it came to market

56:14.972 --> 56:16.572
everything original about it
had been striped away.

56:16.574 --> 56:18.340
I mean, he just couldn't make
the car he wanted to

56:18.342 --> 56:20.242
with the, with the money he had.

56:20.244 --> 56:22.644
I-- I-- I actually felt
sorry for him at that point

56:22.646 --> 56:25.247
'cause there he was schlepping
himself around the world

56:25.249 --> 56:26.882
attempting to sell this,

56:26.884 --> 56:28.717
this dream he didn't
even believe in any more.

56:28.719 --> 56:32.254
Well, that's quite an insight
for a man with no experience.

56:32.256 --> 56:33.655
Well, I know cars.

56:33.657 --> 56:36.258
You know, John knows cars.
Obviously, he...

56:36.260 --> 56:38.060
Boils down to the fact that
the car wasn't good enough.

56:38.062 --> 56:39.528
- You know, just ask him.
- Okay.

56:39.530 --> 56:41.397
- Mr. Hoffman, I don't think--
- Well, ask him.

56:41.399 --> 56:43.799
Eh, the car wasn't good enough,
was it, John?

56:50.441 --> 56:52.541
Am I right? Uh, I mean,
that's the problem here.

56:52.543 --> 56:55.344
- Not all this other shit.
- Mr. Hoffman!

56:55.346 --> 56:58.547
[gavel thumping]
Settle! Settle down.

56:58.549 --> 57:01.784
Mr. Hoffman,
the car is not on trial here,

57:01.786 --> 57:03.185
and neither are you.

57:03.187 --> 57:06.789
I know. I know. Sorry.

57:06.791 --> 57:09.258
Judge Takasugi: Mr. Weitzman.
- Y-- y-- yes, Your Honor.

57:09.260 --> 57:11.126
But we are getting
to the crux of the matter.

57:11.128 --> 57:13.562
Mr. Hoffman,
if cars are clearly your thing

57:13.564 --> 57:15.597
and the DeLorean was,
in your eyes,

57:15.599 --> 57:18.634
such a disappointment,
is this perhaps reason enough

57:18.636 --> 57:21.036
to betray your friend
and neighbor?

57:23.040 --> 57:25.007
[phone ringing]

57:26.944 --> 57:28.577
[ringing continues]

57:28.579 --> 57:29.978
Oh, John, just this once.

57:29.980 --> 57:31.013
Alright, it's okay.

57:31.715 --> 57:32.714
Yeah.

57:34.618 --> 57:36.051
Fuck!

57:36.053 --> 57:37.252
John?

57:37.254 --> 57:39.388
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

57:39.390 --> 57:41.290
No. Don't you say anything.

57:41.292 --> 57:44.393
If it comes from anyone,
it comes from me.

57:44.395 --> 57:47.429
That bitch! That fucking bitch!
You were right.

57:47.431 --> 57:48.964
What about Belfast?

57:48.966 --> 57:49.998
Alright.

57:50.768 --> 57:52.835
Do that.

57:52.837 --> 57:55.103
Molly's gone
to the fucking papers.

57:55.105 --> 57:56.338
- Fuck!
- Why would she?

57:56.340 --> 57:58.273
[John sighs] I got to go
to Belfast.

57:58.275 --> 57:59.341
- Now?
- Mm-hm.

57:59.343 --> 58:00.509
I'll get your case.

58:00.511 --> 58:02.511
[phone ringing]

58:04.415 --> 58:07.115
Yep. Bill...

58:07.117 --> 58:10.018
No, I'm not gonna talk
to every fucking...

58:10.020 --> 58:12.421
Yeah, I'll take the "Times."
Patch 'em through.

58:12.423 --> 58:15.357
Molly. I told you.

58:15.359 --> 58:17.659
Hey, John, anything I can do?

58:17.661 --> 58:18.694
No. No.

58:18.696 --> 58:20.195
- Should we go?
- No.

58:20.197 --> 58:23.031
- Just finish the caviar. Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:23.033 --> 58:26.201
Yes, Jeff, I absolutely refute
these allegations.

58:26.203 --> 58:29.171
No company in the world has been
subjected to more scrutiny

58:29.173 --> 58:30.506
from you gentlemen in the press,

58:30.508 --> 58:32.641
from auditors, from accountants.

58:32.643 --> 58:34.009
[indistinct chatter]

58:34.011 --> 58:36.311
John: Look, Jeff,
off the record...

58:36.313 --> 58:37.779
Okay. On the record,

58:37.781 --> 58:39.715
she's nothing more than
a glorified secretary,

58:39.717 --> 58:41.216
and she wasn't even
up to that job.

58:41.218 --> 58:42.851
Can we go, please?

58:42.853 --> 58:44.286
John: There are no such thing
as secret

58:44.288 --> 58:46.355
Swiss bank accounts.

58:46.357 --> 58:48.857
Molly Gibson had absolutely
no access

58:48.859 --> 58:51.059
to detailed financial records.

58:52.062 --> 58:53.529
That is it.

58:53.531 --> 58:54.863
She had access to everything.

58:54.865 --> 58:57.566
Fucking everything! Fuck!

58:57.568 --> 59:00.135
Mr. Hoffman, you are aware
that these allegations

59:00.137 --> 59:02.905
of financial impropriety
were fully investigated

59:02.907 --> 59:05.173
by the British government
and dismissed.

59:05.175 --> 59:07.843
Dismissed. Absolutely.

59:07.845 --> 59:11.413
Ladies and gentlemen, the truth
is that while John DeLorean

59:11.415 --> 59:14.082
was in the eye of the hurricane,
so to speak,

59:14.084 --> 59:16.685
Mr. Hoffman's sole contribution

59:16.687 --> 59:20.322
was that of a glorified
groundskeeper.

59:20.324 --> 59:22.591
Jim: That is not true.

59:22.593 --> 59:24.226
I cleaned his pool as well.

59:24.228 --> 59:26.228
[people laughing]

59:28.933 --> 59:30.499
John: Doin' a good job
down there.

59:32.036 --> 59:33.769
[Jim laughs] Hey.

59:33.771 --> 59:36.371
What's up, John?
I didn't know you were back.

59:36.373 --> 59:38.407
Got in last night.

59:41.078 --> 59:43.412
You want a beer?

59:43.414 --> 59:44.746
Sure.

59:46.750 --> 59:49.952
There was a moment there
when it was absolutely perfect.

59:51.288 --> 59:53.288
[John sighs]

59:58.529 --> 1:00:01.129
I don't have the cash
to make payroll.

1:00:01.131 --> 1:00:04.466
Renault is going to stop
supplying our engines.

1:00:04.468 --> 1:00:06.201
Of the 8000 cars we've built,

1:00:06.203 --> 1:00:08.470
I've sold maybe 3000.

1:00:10.407 --> 1:00:12.908
I owe Bank of America
$20 million,

1:00:12.910 --> 1:00:15.844
and they own every car
on this side of the Atlantic.

1:00:17.247 --> 1:00:19.982
All of their loans
are being called in.

1:00:20.985 --> 1:00:23.185
That facility is cancelled.

1:00:25.789 --> 1:00:27.656
Well, I mean, you know,
things could get worse.

1:00:27.658 --> 1:00:30.626
[both laugh]

1:00:31.662 --> 1:00:33.996
It's over, buddy.

1:00:33.998 --> 1:00:36.498
Wait a minute.
That's not... No. Uh-uh.

1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:38.634
No. No, no, no.
I-- I-- I don't believe that.

1:00:38.636 --> 1:00:40.902
Not for a second.
Eh, look...

1:00:40.904 --> 1:00:43.472
You're-- you're gonna
think of something.

1:00:43.474 --> 1:00:45.307
You'll work it out.
You always do, you know.

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:47.109
You know what? This is a lot
like that-- that...

1:00:47.111 --> 1:00:48.477
The car that your
dad bought you.

1:00:48.479 --> 1:00:49.511
No, it is.

1:00:49.513 --> 1:00:51.246
Y-- y-- you got the whole thing

1:00:51.248 --> 1:00:53.015
laid out in front of you
in a million pieces,

1:00:53.017 --> 1:00:54.916
and-- and what did you do in
that situation?

1:00:54.918 --> 1:00:55.951
You put that thing back
together.

1:00:55.953 --> 1:00:57.486
You know, better than new.

1:00:57.488 --> 1:00:59.087
Because that's...
I mean, that's who you are.

1:00:59.089 --> 1:01:01.456
I appreciate your optimism, Jim.
But it's no good.

1:01:01.458 --> 1:01:03.525
No, no, no.
Th-- th-- this is not optimism.

1:01:03.527 --> 1:01:05.961
That's not what's goin' on here.
This is fact.

1:01:05.963 --> 1:01:07.696
You are a remarkable guy.

1:01:07.698 --> 1:01:08.830
You're a force of nature.

1:01:08.832 --> 1:01:10.766
[chuckling]
You are.

1:01:10.768 --> 1:01:12.668
Me, I'm full of shit.

1:01:12.670 --> 1:01:14.169
Alright?
But I know I'm full of shit.

1:01:14.171 --> 1:01:15.270
So there's charm in that.
You know? I think.

1:01:15.272 --> 1:01:17.472
I hope. Right?

1:01:17.474 --> 1:01:21.209
But, no, really. You,
you actually get stuff done.

1:01:21.211 --> 1:01:23.111
Why don't you help me?

1:01:23.113 --> 1:01:24.846
Absolutely. Whatever you need.

1:01:24.848 --> 1:01:28.483
I need to raise $30 million
in the next ten days.

1:01:28.485 --> 1:01:30.485
And there's no bank,
no hedge fund,

1:01:30.487 --> 1:01:32.621
no investor who's going to
lend it to me.

1:01:34.224 --> 1:01:36.692
But you know people.

1:01:40.898 --> 1:01:42.664
[Jim chuckles softly]

1:01:42.666 --> 1:01:45.701
I... [chuckles]

1:01:45.703 --> 1:01:47.703
Now I have a good business.

1:01:50.007 --> 1:01:52.808
I can make people very wealthy.

1:01:52.810 --> 1:01:55.010
It's a cash flow problem.
Alright?

1:01:55.012 --> 1:01:57.446
I need to raise
$30 million.

1:01:58.582 --> 1:02:00.248
And you know people.

1:02:02.686 --> 1:02:05.153
Bolivia. Thailand.
All the rest of it.

1:02:06.590 --> 1:02:08.657
You know people.

1:02:08.659 --> 1:02:10.258
[chuckles softly]

1:02:13.564 --> 1:02:15.664
What are we talking about here,
John?

1:02:15.666 --> 1:02:17.332
[exhales]

1:02:20.871 --> 1:02:23.338
That I need your help.

1:02:27.911 --> 1:02:30.712
I need this, Jim.

1:02:30.714 --> 1:02:34.683
There are 2000 workers
in Belfast that need this.

1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:38.720
You know, the joke is,
I could walk away now

1:02:38.722 --> 1:02:40.922
and still be a very rich man.

1:02:42.559 --> 1:02:44.159
But I can't do that.

1:02:45.696 --> 1:02:47.462
I'm not that guy.

1:02:52.102 --> 1:02:53.235
Can you help me, Jim?

1:02:53.237 --> 1:02:56.204
[intense music]

1:02:58.275 --> 1:03:01.042
[engine cranking]

1:03:01.044 --> 1:03:02.277
[brakes screeching]

1:03:08.452 --> 1:03:10.552
[exhales]

1:03:10.554 --> 1:03:13.522
[indistinct chatter]

1:03:15.092 --> 1:03:18.059
[upbeat music]

1:03:25.636 --> 1:03:27.636
- You're early.
- Um-hm.

1:03:29.606 --> 1:03:31.239
DeLorean wants me to set him up

1:03:31.241 --> 1:03:33.308
with $30 million
worth of cocaine.

1:03:35.179 --> 1:03:36.511
What?

1:03:38.115 --> 1:03:39.915
John DeLorean...

1:03:39.917 --> 1:03:41.917
$30 million. Cocaine.

1:03:41.919 --> 1:03:43.451
If I put him and Hetrick
together,

1:03:43.453 --> 1:03:45.353
that'd be a pretty sweet deal
for you, yeah?

1:03:46.623 --> 1:03:47.956
Wait, wait, wait.
John DeLorean?

1:03:47.958 --> 1:03:49.457
Why on earth would
John DeLorean--

1:03:49.459 --> 1:03:52.093
Who gives a shit?
Hey, you want a big name

1:03:52.095 --> 1:03:54.596
for President Reagan?
You wanna stop drowning?

1:03:54.598 --> 1:03:58.700
I can give you John DeLorean
on a silver fucking platter.

1:03:58.702 --> 1:04:00.769
And I'll do it.

1:04:00.771 --> 1:04:03.939
All I ask is that,
my family and I go free,

1:04:03.941 --> 1:04:06.842
my record is expunged...

1:04:06.844 --> 1:04:08.109
and I get ten percent
of whatever

1:04:08.111 --> 1:04:10.078
Morgan transfers to Davrow.

1:04:14.618 --> 1:04:17.018
What's wrong, Special Agent?

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:19.521
This kind of decision
outside your pay grade?

1:04:22.359 --> 1:04:23.792
I got to make a call.

1:04:23.794 --> 1:04:26.761
[intense music]

1:04:34.037 --> 1:04:35.370
[exhales]

1:04:37.374 --> 1:04:40.508
Jim: Look, we never thought this
whole thing was gonna happen.

1:04:40.510 --> 1:04:43.044
John was looking
for the funds legally but, uh,

1:04:43.046 --> 1:04:45.247
you know, this whole drug thing
was a weird fantasy.

1:04:45.249 --> 1:04:46.748
Right.

1:04:46.750 --> 1:04:48.149
But, you know, then, once

1:04:48.151 --> 1:04:49.417
the FBI got involved,

1:04:49.419 --> 1:04:51.353
they got very excited about it.

1:04:51.355 --> 1:04:54.422
And that's when we decided
to bring Davrow in.

1:04:54.424 --> 1:04:57.125
Ah. Davrow.

1:04:58.428 --> 1:05:00.161
Yeah, let's talk about Davrow.

1:05:00.163 --> 1:05:02.230
<i> Jim: There's nothin'</i>
<i> to understand.</i>

1:05:02.232 --> 1:05:04.199
It's a road trip. Okay? The guy
is under a lot of pressure.

1:05:04.201 --> 1:05:06.034
We're all under a lot of
pressure.

1:05:06.036 --> 1:05:08.670
Yeah, no, I know. Okay. But his
has a few more decimal points.

1:05:08.672 --> 1:05:12.073
Okay? I'm just introducing him
to a banker right now.

1:05:21.451 --> 1:05:22.684
Bill: Budget Rental Car's
talking about

1:05:22.686 --> 1:05:24.519
taking a thousand cars.

1:05:24.521 --> 1:05:26.388
They figure there are a lot of
people who don't necessarily

1:05:26.390 --> 1:05:28.623
want to own a DeLorean,
but they would love

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:30.625
to experience driving one.

1:05:32.596 --> 1:05:34.195
John.

1:05:34.197 --> 1:05:37.365
- John.
- I just can't keep doing this.

1:05:37.367 --> 1:05:41.736
They walk us up the aisle and
fuck us before we take our vows.

1:05:41.738 --> 1:05:43.571
Alright, I got this other
meeting to go to.

1:05:43.573 --> 1:05:45.273
- Are we set?
- All set.

1:05:45.275 --> 1:05:47.042
- What other meeting?
- You're doin' a great job.

1:05:47.044 --> 1:05:49.811
- Keep it up.
Bill: Why with him?

1:05:49.813 --> 1:05:52.547
Why would you go to a meeting
with him?

1:05:52.549 --> 1:05:55.517
[dramatic music]

1:05:59.589 --> 1:06:00.822
Hey, hey, hey.

1:06:02.159 --> 1:06:04.392
You built it. You drive it.

1:06:06.129 --> 1:06:08.496
[engine cranking]

1:06:08.498 --> 1:06:11.499
[engine revving]

1:06:11.501 --> 1:06:14.502
[music continues]

1:06:20.510 --> 1:06:23.511
[engine revving]

1:06:26.483 --> 1:06:28.683
Bill: ...specialize in building
money in high risk,

1:06:28.685 --> 1:06:30.151
high yield investments.

1:06:30.153 --> 1:06:32.220
John:
That just won't work, Bill.

1:06:45.268 --> 1:06:48.236
[engine revving]

1:06:50.707 --> 1:06:52.107
[tires screeching]

1:07:03.053 --> 1:07:04.652
[John chuckling]

1:07:04.654 --> 1:07:06.121
What?

1:07:08.692 --> 1:07:12.961
When I get this money
I'm going right back to...

1:07:12.963 --> 1:07:16.031
[inhales]
going right back to that sketch.

1:07:17.067 --> 1:07:18.133
[chuckles softly]

1:07:19.536 --> 1:07:21.569
I want that feeling back.

1:07:24.307 --> 1:07:26.007
And how it felt

1:07:26.009 --> 1:07:28.810
when you're driving down
the street

1:07:28.812 --> 1:07:32.247
in the car you built yourself.

1:07:32.249 --> 1:07:34.616
And you know your dad's
watching you

1:07:35.685 --> 1:07:37.986
and you just...

1:07:37.988 --> 1:07:40.188
swell up.

1:07:40.190 --> 1:07:42.157
[mellow music]

1:07:43.660 --> 1:07:46.661
[engine revving]

1:07:46.663 --> 1:07:48.396
You know, John,
it's not too late to back out

1:07:48.398 --> 1:07:50.565
of this thing, right?

1:07:50.567 --> 1:07:52.700
Because these guys, I mean...

1:07:52.702 --> 1:07:55.036
they, um,
they're not good people.

1:07:55.038 --> 1:07:56.771
And once they get their
hooks in you, it can really--

1:07:56.773 --> 1:07:59.441
There are an awful lot of
families in Northern Ireland,

1:07:59.443 --> 1:08:00.942
who need this.

1:08:02.579 --> 1:08:06.981
Men and women not afraid
to stand up and be counted.

1:08:09.186 --> 1:08:10.985
And if they can do it...

1:08:12.055 --> 1:08:14.722
goddamn right, I can as well.

1:08:14.724 --> 1:08:17.692
[music continues]

1:08:35.545 --> 1:08:37.412
Nice to meet you.
James Benedict.

1:08:37.414 --> 1:08:38.980
Um-hm.

1:08:38.982 --> 1:08:40.215
Hi.

1:08:41.618 --> 1:08:43.084
[chuckles softly]

1:08:43.086 --> 1:08:46.788
I can't believe I'm here
with John DeLorean.

1:08:46.790 --> 1:08:47.989
I saw you on TV.

1:08:47.991 --> 1:08:51.226
- Well, I'm on TV a lot.
- I...

1:08:52.262 --> 1:08:55.063
- Coffee?
- Black.

1:08:55.065 --> 1:08:58.867
Benedict: I'm not sure that, uh,
TV is good for business.

1:09:00.270 --> 1:09:03.438
I don't exactly relish
the spotlight.

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:05.507
Well, the way I see it,
the darkest dark

1:09:05.509 --> 1:09:07.442
is the dark besides the
spotlight.

1:09:07.444 --> 1:09:10.178
You can do anything there
and no one seems to notice.

1:09:11.781 --> 1:09:15.350
Benedict: I like that.
The darkest dark...

1:09:17.087 --> 1:09:21.489
So, uh, John, I, uh,
I like what I see of the, uh...

1:09:21.491 --> 1:09:23.258
It's funny, they call it
the DeLorean

1:09:23.260 --> 1:09:26.294
in front of John DeLorean.
But, uh, yeah. Great things.

1:09:26.296 --> 1:09:30.298
Um, I love the wings.
They're futuristic.

1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:31.499
Maybe I'll get a car
out of this.

1:09:31.501 --> 1:09:32.934
[knock on door]

1:09:32.936 --> 1:09:34.269
[door opens]

1:09:40.343 --> 1:09:41.543
John.

1:09:42.279 --> 1:09:44.312
[chuckling]

1:09:44.314 --> 1:09:46.147
I guess fate has dealt you
a dirty blow.

1:09:46.149 --> 1:09:48.216
- Well, I'm still swinging.
- Good for you.

1:09:48.218 --> 1:09:49.517
[John chuckles]

1:09:51.121 --> 1:09:53.655
- James Benedict.
- Morgan... Hetrick.

1:09:53.657 --> 1:09:55.723
- Uh, coffee?
- Nope.

1:09:56.993 --> 1:09:59.494
So, John.
What's the story?

1:09:59.496 --> 1:10:01.496
The story is, the British
government has written off

1:10:01.498 --> 1:10:04.299
two hundred twenty eight
million dollars of our debt.

1:10:04.301 --> 1:10:06.634
But they won't pay us
the 94 they still owe us.

1:10:06.636 --> 1:10:10.538
And that is exactly why
I stay away from anything

1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:11.639
to do with governments.

1:10:11.641 --> 1:10:14.142
[all laughing]

1:10:14.144 --> 1:10:15.843
Morgan, I think we can all agree

1:10:15.845 --> 1:10:18.713
that this could be the start of
a very good relationship.

1:10:18.715 --> 1:10:20.348
Mutually beneficial.

1:10:20.350 --> 1:10:21.649
Shall we?

1:10:33.530 --> 1:10:34.929
Jim.

1:10:37.267 --> 1:10:39.167
You're the point man on this.
Do you wanna...

1:10:40.237 --> 1:10:42.870
Okay, well, we all know that

1:10:42.872 --> 1:10:46.874
John is one of the finest
businessmen in-- in-- in,

1:10:46.876 --> 1:10:48.610
on this planet. Umm--

1:10:48.612 --> 1:10:52.847
Don't need a fucking
biography, Jim. What's the deal?

1:10:52.849 --> 1:10:56.417
Uh, you know, I'm not really
sure where to start. Um...

1:10:56.419 --> 1:10:59.187
The deal is, my company's worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

1:10:59.189 --> 1:11:01.356
Anyone who's looked at our books
agrees on that.

1:11:01.358 --> 1:11:02.924
But I've hit a cash flow problem

1:11:02.926 --> 1:11:04.292
and I need to plug the gap.

1:11:04.294 --> 1:11:06.794
I have two million,
I need to turn it

1:11:06.796 --> 1:11:09.130
into thirty million
within eight days,

1:11:09.132 --> 1:11:10.598
or we lose control.

1:11:12.435 --> 1:11:14.602
- Jim?
- Yeah.

1:11:14.604 --> 1:11:16.604
So, uh, we need you to go down
to Columbia

1:11:16.606 --> 1:11:18.206
and pick up the merchandise.

1:11:18.208 --> 1:11:20.475
I don't sell.
I don't distribute.

1:11:20.477 --> 1:11:21.876
It's not my game.

1:11:21.878 --> 1:11:23.244
Yeah, we're not asking you
to do that.

1:11:23.246 --> 1:11:24.712
We have someone for that.

1:11:24.714 --> 1:11:26.247
Who?

1:11:26.249 --> 1:11:27.782
- I don't like--
- His name is John Vicenza.

1:11:27.784 --> 1:11:29.484
This is what he does.

1:11:29.486 --> 1:11:32.086
He put a lot of money
through this bank.

1:11:32.088 --> 1:11:33.321
A lot of money.

1:11:33.323 --> 1:11:34.989
So everything goes smooth,

1:11:34.991 --> 1:11:36.491
everybody gets their cut,

1:11:36.493 --> 1:11:38.259
John gets to keep his company,

1:11:38.261 --> 1:11:41.396
and, uh, we get an option
to invest, to diversify.

1:11:41.398 --> 1:11:43.931
Because if you do too much here,
it raises flags.

1:11:43.933 --> 1:11:45.900
Yeah, absolutely,
nature of our business,

1:11:45.902 --> 1:11:48.469
we move money all over the world
without explaining it.

1:11:53.276 --> 1:11:54.842
Okay.

1:11:58.014 --> 1:11:59.380
Got to admit.

1:12:00.417 --> 1:12:02.317
You make me nervous.

1:12:07.757 --> 1:12:09.023
[Morgan puffing]

1:12:09.025 --> 1:12:11.426
Jim. Jim. Jim.

1:12:16.700 --> 1:12:18.099
We have history.

1:12:19.869 --> 1:12:21.269
What kind of history?

1:12:22.439 --> 1:12:24.172
The wrong kind.

1:12:26.543 --> 1:12:28.676
Morgan: Look, I don't want
any kind of thing structured

1:12:28.678 --> 1:12:30.978
where Jim here has a chance
to fuck around.

1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:32.847
- Okay?
- Oh, boy.

1:12:32.849 --> 1:12:34.882
I mean, what if Jim
takes the monkeys.

1:12:36.486 --> 1:12:39.987
Jim says
I'm going to my dealer.

1:12:39.989 --> 1:12:42.623
Jim comes back with
some bruises.

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:46.694
Jim says someone
stole the monkeys.

1:12:48.164 --> 1:12:49.997
Benedict:
That's not gonna happen, Morgan.

1:12:49.999 --> 1:12:52.734
First, Jim's money is
tied up with me.

1:12:52.736 --> 1:12:54.969
He knows if he does anything
funny, the money disappears.

1:12:54.971 --> 1:12:57.972
And second, Vicenza.

1:12:57.974 --> 1:13:00.808
Jim's head would be
on a platter.

1:13:00.810 --> 1:13:03.611
And his wife's. And kids.

1:13:06.015 --> 1:13:08.416
So, there's no worries
on that front.

1:13:10.553 --> 1:13:11.886
You trust him?

1:13:12.856 --> 1:13:15.823
[intense music]

1:13:21.865 --> 1:13:24.665
As much as any man here.
[chuckles]

1:13:24.667 --> 1:13:26.367
[laughing]

1:13:26.369 --> 1:13:28.202
John: Alright, now,
if the Brits make a move

1:13:28.204 --> 1:13:30.872
and, um, and the cash
isn't in the bank,

1:13:30.874 --> 1:13:32.774
maybe I need some sort
of promissory note

1:13:32.776 --> 1:13:34.542
I can present to them.
Would that be doable?

1:13:34.544 --> 1:13:37.412
There's a lot of factors
involved, but, uh...

1:13:37.414 --> 1:13:39.614
Yeah, we can look at that
all things being even.

1:13:40.850 --> 1:13:42.116
Morgan?

1:13:47.590 --> 1:13:49.023
I guess we got a deal.

1:13:49.025 --> 1:13:51.993
[dramatic music]

1:13:59.235 --> 1:14:02.703
Well, that went pretty well.

1:14:02.705 --> 1:14:04.939
Morgan's a good pilot.
And he's careful.

1:14:04.941 --> 1:14:06.441
And a contact for the monkeys.

1:14:06.443 --> 1:14:08.242
- Stop saying monkeys.
- Morgan, he's--

1:14:08.244 --> 1:14:10.311
Yeah, Morgan says it because
he's a piece of shit criminal.

1:14:10.313 --> 1:14:12.246
Alright?
He's allowed to say monkeys.

1:14:12.248 --> 1:14:14.549
You're not allowed to say
monkeys. Stop saying it.

1:14:14.551 --> 1:14:16.517
You sound like a fucking idiot.

1:14:19.088 --> 1:14:22.089
[phone ringing]

1:14:22.091 --> 1:14:24.892
- Hoffman residence.
- Hey. I'm not ready to go.

1:14:24.894 --> 1:14:26.994
But I ain't goin' nowhere
without John's two million.

1:14:26.996 --> 1:14:29.397
- Any word?
- Uh, no, but, um, let me...

1:14:29.399 --> 1:14:30.965
I-- I'll call you right back,
okay?

1:14:30.967 --> 1:14:32.800
Hey, these guys do not
hang around. Alright?

1:14:32.802 --> 1:14:34.802
You just get that fuckin' money.

1:14:37.507 --> 1:14:38.906
[phone ringing]

1:14:38.908 --> 1:14:40.975
[sighs]

1:14:40.977 --> 1:14:43.611
- Morgan, what?
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1:14:43.613 --> 1:14:44.979
Hey, uh, don't worry.
Everything's under control.

1:14:44.981 --> 1:14:46.247
Okay? I-- I just, um...

1:14:46.249 --> 1:14:47.782
Look, John says
he has the money.

1:14:47.784 --> 1:14:49.116
Yeah, well,
I say I have a nine-inch cock.

1:14:49.118 --> 1:14:50.585
It doesn't make it true.

1:14:50.587 --> 1:14:51.919
We need to show
he's an active participant,

1:14:51.921 --> 1:14:53.654
not just a groupie.

1:14:53.656 --> 1:14:55.756
I understand, okay? You got to
trust me here, okay? I...

1:14:55.758 --> 1:14:57.358
Hello? He...

1:14:58.127 --> 1:14:59.494
Shit! Shit!

1:14:59.496 --> 1:15:01.929
[phone ringing]

1:15:01.931 --> 1:15:04.131
- Hello.
- John. Hey.

1:15:04.133 --> 1:15:05.833
Wh... Oklahoma?

1:15:05.835 --> 1:15:07.034
What the hell's in Oklahoma?

1:15:07.036 --> 1:15:08.503
Well, nothing, as it turns out.

1:15:08.505 --> 1:15:10.171
Has Morgan, um...

1:15:10.173 --> 1:15:11.305
Well, you know, I just got off
the phone with him.

1:15:11.307 --> 1:15:13.007
Okay? So, he's ready to go.

1:15:13.009 --> 1:15:15.710
He's not going anywhere until
you provide the finance.

1:15:18.481 --> 1:15:20.815
John on phone: Uh, it's coming.
I have to be careful.

1:15:20.817 --> 1:15:23.551
Hey. You're the one with the,
uh, the deadline, man.

1:15:23.553 --> 1:15:26.454
I know that. I...
I will have the money.

1:15:26.456 --> 1:15:28.222
Okay. Alright. W...
I just want you to understand.

1:15:28.224 --> 1:15:29.490
I mean, it's got to be tomorrow

1:15:29.492 --> 1:15:30.992
or-- or-- or the whole thing
is off.

1:15:30.994 --> 1:15:32.627
Yeah. Tomorrow. Absolutely.

1:15:32.629 --> 1:15:34.662
Okay. Hey, John...
John, just, you know,

1:15:34.664 --> 1:15:36.197
level with me here, okay?

1:15:36.199 --> 1:15:37.532
If you don't have the money,
just tell me now.

1:15:37.534 --> 1:15:39.133
No, I have the money.

1:15:43.206 --> 1:15:44.405
Okay. Okay.

1:15:44.407 --> 1:15:45.873
[phone ringing]

1:15:45.875 --> 1:15:47.808
Oh, boy.

1:15:47.810 --> 1:15:50.311
- Hello.
- I don't have the money.

1:15:50.313 --> 1:15:52.213
Goddammit, John!

1:15:52.215 --> 1:15:54.415
I thought I had the money.
I don't have the money.

1:15:54.417 --> 1:15:56.317
Okay, well, what the hell
am I supposed to do with that?

1:15:56.319 --> 1:15:57.919
Well, cash flow has always
been the problem.

1:15:57.921 --> 1:15:59.687
No, no, no! No, John.

1:15:59.689 --> 1:16:02.657
No, you're fucking bullshit
has always been the problem.

1:16:04.027 --> 1:16:05.493
Damn it.

1:16:07.230 --> 1:16:09.730
[phone ringing]

1:16:09.732 --> 1:16:11.332
- Now what?
Benedict on phone: You tell me.

1:16:11.334 --> 1:16:14.035
[breathing heavily]
John doesn't have the money.

1:16:14.037 --> 1:16:15.503
Yeah, I know he doesn't have the
money. What do you think?

1:16:15.505 --> 1:16:17.004
I've been listening
to the Bee Gees all day?

1:16:17.006 --> 1:16:19.173
So, fuck him, and fuck you!

1:16:19.175 --> 1:16:20.841
Wait, no, no, no. Hold on.
H-- hold on a second.

1:16:20.843 --> 1:16:22.343
Okay? I'm... Look, I'm...

1:16:22.345 --> 1:16:24.078
Uh... We're not done yet. Okay?

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:25.713
Benedict: How the fuck did you
work that out?

1:16:25.715 --> 1:16:29.183
You... You-- you have to
lend him the money.

1:16:29.185 --> 1:16:30.751
What?

1:16:30.753 --> 1:16:31.919
Well, Davrow has to
lend him the money.

1:16:31.921 --> 1:16:33.187
Okay? It's an investment.

1:16:33.189 --> 1:16:35.122
Hoffman, let me
get this straight...

1:16:35.124 --> 1:16:38.392
You want the FBI to lend
John DeLorean

1:16:38.394 --> 1:16:41.696
two million dollars
so that he can buy the cocaine

1:16:41.698 --> 1:16:43.531
that we're going to
arrest him with?

1:16:43.533 --> 1:16:44.932
Yeah, that's right.

1:16:44.934 --> 1:16:46.534
You outta your fuckin' mind?

1:16:48.137 --> 1:16:49.470
No...

1:16:49.472 --> 1:16:51.872
[groans]
God!

1:16:51.874 --> 1:16:54.141
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:16:54.143 --> 1:16:56.243
Okay.

1:16:56.245 --> 1:16:57.712
No, uh, Ellen,
it's not what it...

1:16:57.714 --> 1:17:00.147
Morgan Hetrick, I get.
John is your friend.

1:17:00.149 --> 1:17:03.050
No, no, no.
He is not our friend. Okay?

1:17:03.052 --> 1:17:05.586
The guy waltz into our life
completely uninvited.

1:17:05.588 --> 1:17:07.221
Uh-- uh, look, I like him, okay?

1:17:07.223 --> 1:17:08.289
And, yes, he's done some
great things,

1:17:08.291 --> 1:17:09.757
but at the end of the day,

1:17:09.759 --> 1:17:11.425
he is as full of shit
as the rest of us.

1:17:11.427 --> 1:17:13.628
- Don't you drag him down--
- Drag him?

1:17:13.630 --> 1:17:16.397
No, he came to me, Ellen.

1:17:16.399 --> 1:17:18.299
He wanted me to
set up a drug deal...

1:17:18.301 --> 1:17:19.600
cocaine!

1:17:19.602 --> 1:17:22.136
Okay? He wants to deal
in cocaine.

1:17:22.138 --> 1:17:23.404
I mean, how fucked up
you have to be

1:17:23.406 --> 1:17:24.639
to think you can
save your company

1:17:24.641 --> 1:17:25.806
with a coke deal.

1:17:25.808 --> 1:17:29.110
Huh? He's no better than Morgan.

1:17:29.112 --> 1:17:31.946
You know... You know what?
Actually, he's worse. He is.

1:17:31.948 --> 1:17:33.848
He sells this dream to people,

1:17:33.850 --> 1:17:35.650
and it's all bullshit.

1:17:35.652 --> 1:17:37.585
Okay, look,
if he goes through with this

1:17:37.587 --> 1:17:39.787
then you and me, the kids,
we're home free. Okay?

1:17:39.789 --> 1:17:40.921
We get millions.

1:17:40.923 --> 1:17:42.590
Jim, what are you talking about?

1:17:42.592 --> 1:17:43.624
- Oh--
Ellen: Jim--

1:17:43.626 --> 1:17:44.925
I have a deal.

1:17:44.927 --> 1:17:46.594
I have deal cut.

1:17:46.596 --> 1:17:49.363
Alright. Ten percent
of whatever the FBI recovers.

1:17:49.365 --> 1:17:51.032
Okay? We're talking millions.

1:17:51.034 --> 1:17:53.968
You can have all the fucking
marbles that you want.

1:17:53.970 --> 1:17:56.103
You can, yeah.
And it is what you deserve.

1:17:56.105 --> 1:17:57.972
Honestly, it is.

1:17:57.974 --> 1:17:59.607
After all the bullshit
that I put your through,

1:17:59.609 --> 1:18:01.342
all the-- all the,
all the promises...

1:18:01.344 --> 1:18:04.111
- This is another promise.
- No! No! Not...

1:18:04.113 --> 1:18:05.479
Oh, baby, no.

1:18:05.481 --> 1:18:07.448
Not this time. Okay, look.
Listen to me...

1:18:08.351 --> 1:18:09.817
You have to trust me.

1:18:09.819 --> 1:18:11.719
Okay? Just trust me
one last time, please.

Hey.
Hey, where's Morgan?

1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:34.141
Oh, he's not here tonight.
He's got a hot date.

1:18:34.143 --> 1:18:36.811
Hey, psst.
Join the party.

1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:38.746
Go on.

1:18:39.415 --> 1:18:40.715
Thanks.

1:18:42.552 --> 1:18:46.554
Drink up.

1:19:01.370 --> 1:19:03.671
<i> And I remember lookin' at you</i>

1:19:03.673 --> 1:19:06.674
and... thinkin' there was
something different about you.

1:19:06.676 --> 1:19:08.843
I couldn't put my
finger on it, but...

1:19:10.279 --> 1:19:11.612
But Ellen...

1:19:12.448 --> 1:19:15.049
Ellen was... She, um...

1:19:15.051 --> 1:19:17.451
You know,
she spotted it right away.

1:19:17.453 --> 1:19:18.486
[snaps finger]

1:19:19.856 --> 1:19:21.956
You know what it is?

1:19:21.958 --> 1:19:23.457
It's your chin.

1:19:24.694 --> 1:19:25.760
[chuckles]

1:19:27.363 --> 1:19:29.263
You alright?

1:19:29.265 --> 1:19:32.933
See, 'cause in your...
The old photos of you...

1:19:32.935 --> 1:19:34.935
you don't have much of a chin.

1:19:37.306 --> 1:19:39.206
Now you have a chin.

1:19:39.208 --> 1:19:41.142
See what I'm saying?

1:19:41.144 --> 1:19:43.577
It's no secret,
I had a procedure.

1:19:43.579 --> 1:19:45.112
You're chinless.

1:19:45.114 --> 1:19:46.514
Alright, Jim.

1:19:50.653 --> 1:19:51.819
You're a fake.

1:19:51.821 --> 1:19:53.554
Because I had a procedure?

1:19:53.556 --> 1:19:55.589
Half of California
has plastic surgery.

1:19:55.591 --> 1:19:56.824
No, no, no.
Not because of that.

1:19:56.826 --> 1:20:00.761
Because you are
inherently chinless.

1:20:00.763 --> 1:20:04.298
I don't trust someone
who doesn't have a chin.

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.834
Now, Jim, I've done everything
I could to raise this money,

1:20:06.836 --> 1:20:09.003
but unfortunately,
with the scrutiny I'm under,

1:20:09.005 --> 1:20:10.671
I've been unable to--

1:20:10.673 --> 1:20:12.239
No, no, no. I don't think
you had any intention.

1:20:12.241 --> 1:20:13.808
I think you're just
stringing us along

1:20:13.810 --> 1:20:15.409
'cause you're a fuckin'
chinless fake.

1:20:15.411 --> 1:20:18.012
- Cut the shit!
- Hmm?

1:20:18.014 --> 1:20:19.580
I was worried
you would fuck it up.

1:20:19.582 --> 1:20:21.782
- Me?
- Morgan thinks you're a snake.

1:20:21.784 --> 1:20:23.651
Morgan. Oh, yeah...
What, you talked to Morgan?

1:20:23.653 --> 1:20:25.319
I talk to everyone,
that's what I do.

1:20:25.321 --> 1:20:27.421
- Okay.
- You fucked him over.

1:20:27.423 --> 1:20:29.690
Oh, okay.
That's what he told you, huh?

1:20:29.692 --> 1:20:31.859
You guys have little chit-chats
and everything now?

1:20:31.861 --> 1:20:33.661
That's good. Well, did he...

1:20:33.663 --> 1:20:35.162
Did he tell you about him
and Cristina?

1:20:35.164 --> 1:20:36.497
- Did that come up?
- Excuse me?

1:20:36.499 --> 1:20:37.798
Oh...

1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:40.134
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
See. No, she...

1:20:40.136 --> 1:20:42.636
Well, Morgan used to work
for this millionaire

1:20:42.638 --> 1:20:47.107
that, that Cristina used to,
uh, see, like, date, or, uh...

1:20:47.109 --> 1:20:48.142
Or how do you put it?

1:20:48.144 --> 1:20:49.710

1:20:49.712 --> 1:20:52.213

1:21:09.498 --> 1:21:11.465
Well, I can't thank you enough.

1:21:14.637 --> 1:21:16.837
John, I'm sorry.

1:21:16.839 --> 1:21:18.572
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

1:21:18.574 --> 1:21:20.407
I... Well...

1:21:20.409 --> 1:21:23.210
It's probably for the best this
whole thing's falling apart.

1:21:24.547 --> 1:21:27.147
That was James Benedict
at Davrow.

1:21:29.018 --> 1:21:31.552
He's gonna loan me
two million dollars.

to survive as long as

Okay. Yeah.
No, sounds good.

1:22:08.624 --> 1:22:10.791
I'm on my way. Alright.

1:22:10.793 --> 1:22:12.426

continue to bail out

John DeLorean's name.

Jim: Yeah,
'cause I am fucking nervous.

1:22:25.474 --> 1:22:26.874
Where's the stuff?

1:22:26.876 --> 1:22:28.943
I told you,
it's in the car with Katy.

1:22:28.945 --> 1:22:30.311
Yeah, well, I hope,
there's some left.

1:22:30.313 --> 1:22:31.879
You better hurry.

How does he know me?

- Don't push me. I'm going.

Don't say a fuckin' word!

fuckin' friend.

Okay, he's gonna be
sitting there.

1:25:16.078 --> 1:25:17.644
I want to be able to see
the expressions on his face

1:25:17.646 --> 1:25:20.481

to see his hands on the coke.

What are you up to, John?

1:26:00.923 --> 1:26:02.523
You didn't actually
rebuild that car

1:26:02.525 --> 1:26:04.591
on your father's lawn, did you?

1:26:06.695 --> 1:26:08.595
No.

1:26:08.597 --> 1:26:10.697
If I so much as stepped
on daddy's lawn

1:26:10.699 --> 1:26:13.200
he'd have beaten six shades
of shit out of me.

1:26:15.004 --> 1:26:17.070
Too bad. I like that story.

1:26:18.807 --> 1:26:22.142
My father was
a born again alcoholic.

1:26:22.144 --> 1:26:24.711
He made everyone's life
a misery.

1:26:27.783 --> 1:26:29.116
You want me to tell them that?

History is written
by the victors.

1:26:35.491 --> 1:26:37.090
I will be remembered.

1:26:38.661 --> 1:26:40.727
My car will be remembered.

I know you're in there.

1:27:10.826 --> 1:27:12.593
Open the door!

1:27:53.702 --> 1:27:55.135
Great.

1:27:59.875 --> 1:28:02.442
- John.
- What the fuck's he doing here?

1:28:02.444 --> 1:28:04.878
Where are you going, John?
Open the window, Jim.

1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:06.580
Open the window, Jim. Jim!

1:28:06.582 --> 1:28:08.949
- What do you want me to do?
- Do what you have to do.

1:28:08.951 --> 1:28:12.386
Come on, Jim.
You fuckin' piece of shit.

1:28:12.388 --> 1:28:13.954
Hey, what the...
Get your hands off me.

1:28:13.956 --> 1:28:15.389
- You're coming with us.
- I know my rights.

you've got him

1:28:19.295 --> 1:28:20.661
head to toe in there.

1:28:26.135 --> 1:28:28.969
I've got the champagne.

1:28:28.971 --> 1:28:30.804
Has this been bugged yet?

1:28:30.806 --> 1:28:33.473
So, what are you gonna do
if something goes wrong?

1:28:33.475 --> 1:28:36.643
It won't.
John always has a plan.

1:28:36.645 --> 1:28:39.579
I've been down this road before
and I love Jim,

1:28:39.581 --> 1:28:41.248
I'm never gonna leave him

1:28:41.250 --> 1:28:43.116
but if John
is just your golden ticket

1:28:43.118 --> 1:28:44.618
then you need to have
a plan 'cause you will be

1:28:44.620 --> 1:28:46.586
dragged down with him.

1:28:49.258 --> 1:28:51.658
[phone ringing]

1:28:52.995 --> 1:28:54.461
- Jim?
- Ellen, it's Bill.

1:28:54.463 --> 1:28:55.762
I'm looking for John,
do you have any idea

1:28:55.764 --> 1:28:57.497
where he is or Cristina or--

1:28:57.499 --> 1:28:59.766
- Has something happened?
- No. What do you mean?

1:28:59.768 --> 1:29:01.802
- What could've happened?
- No, nothing. Sorry, Bill.

1:29:01.804 --> 1:29:05.205
- No, I don't know where--
- Oh, let me talk to him.

1:29:05.207 --> 1:29:06.840
Give me the phone!

1:29:07.776 --> 1:29:09.343
Bill.

1:29:09.345 --> 1:29:11.545
Cristina, it's absolutely vital
that I speak to John

1:29:11.547 --> 1:29:13.113
immediately,
we know he's in LA

1:29:13.115 --> 1:29:16.083
but we can't find him.
You know where he is?

1:29:17.853 --> 1:29:20.854
[dramatic music]

1:29:26.995 --> 1:29:29.963
[indistinct chatter]

1:29:37.039 --> 1:29:38.205
Thank you.

1:29:39.475 --> 1:29:42.209
Well, you're moments away

1:29:42.211 --> 1:29:44.077
from being a very rich man.

1:29:44.079 --> 1:29:45.746
<i> Howard: Okay, let me rephrase</i>
<i> the question.</i>

1:29:45.748 --> 1:29:48.815
Who first raised the subject
of a possible drug deal?

1:29:48.817 --> 1:29:51.418
It's hard to say.
It just kind of came up.

1:29:51.420 --> 1:29:53.186
H-- how did it just "come up?"

1:29:53.188 --> 1:29:56.390
Well, one minute it wasn't there
and the next minute, it was.

1:29:56.392 --> 1:29:58.024
- Hurry up, come on.
- They're in the lobby.

1:29:58.026 --> 1:29:59.259
Heading upstairs.
Let's get everything ready.

1:29:59.261 --> 1:30:00.894
Okay. Got it.

1:30:00.896 --> 1:30:02.929
Agent 1: Hide that,
hide that. Go.

1:30:02.931 --> 1:30:05.432
[intense music]

1:30:09.037 --> 1:30:12.406
Mr. DeLorean, excuse me, sir.
Is it, Mr. DeLorean?

1:30:13.575 --> 1:30:14.908
I have a call for you, sir.

1:30:16.745 --> 1:30:19.913
I'll transfer the call to the
house phone, right over there.

1:30:19.915 --> 1:30:22.749
So did he-- he just call you
and-- and-- and say,

1:30:22.751 --> 1:30:24.851
"Hey, man, I need $30 million

1:30:24.853 --> 1:30:28.288
to save my company,
let's do a drug deal?"

1:30:28.290 --> 1:30:30.424
<i> Jim: What are we talking</i>
<i> about here, John?</i>

1:30:32.728 --> 1:30:34.127
That I need help.

1:30:34.129 --> 1:30:36.196
It's just not cut
and dry like you want.

1:30:36.198 --> 1:30:37.597
I-- I-- it really isn't.

1:30:37.599 --> 1:30:40.133
That's v-- very different
than suggesting

1:30:40.135 --> 1:30:42.402
a-- a-- drug deal,
don't you think?

1:30:42.404 --> 1:30:43.970
Well, it is and it isn't.

1:30:43.972 --> 1:30:45.939
He may have alluded to it.

1:30:45.941 --> 1:30:49.910
You don't think
that Thomas Edison...

1:30:49.912 --> 1:30:51.912
or Ford or Kennedy didn't cut
a few corners

1:30:51.914 --> 1:30:54.014
every now and then
for the greater good?

1:30:55.417 --> 1:30:57.317
Is any of this alluding
to be found

1:30:57.319 --> 1:30:59.920
in the many hours of FBI tapes

1:30:59.922 --> 1:31:02.489
of your phone calls
with Mr. DeLorean?

1:31:02.491 --> 1:31:04.124
Uh, no. This predates that.

1:31:05.928 --> 1:31:07.160
John DeLorean.

1:31:07.162 --> 1:31:08.261
John, we have a deal

1:31:08.263 --> 1:31:09.563
to save the car, the factory...

1:31:09.565 --> 1:31:11.798
- Everything.
- Bill.

1:31:11.800 --> 1:31:13.400
Bill: Minit Financial came
through with a 100 million

1:31:13.402 --> 1:31:15.635
but you need
to sign it now, today,

1:31:15.637 --> 1:31:17.103
before the Brits get wind of it

1:31:17.105 --> 1:31:18.738
or there'll be no company
left to save.

1:31:18.740 --> 1:31:22.142
- I have a deal here.
Bill: No, you don't.

1:31:22.144 --> 1:31:24.311
You have a life sentence.

1:31:24.313 --> 1:31:25.979
You need to sign this.

1:31:25.981 --> 1:31:27.981
[instrumental music]

1:31:27.983 --> 1:31:30.317
- I can't do it, Bill.
- Why, for Christ sake?

1:31:30.319 --> 1:31:32.285
This is what we've been breakin'
our asses for.

1:31:32.287 --> 1:31:34.354
Because they'll own the company.

1:31:35.791 --> 1:31:37.023
At best,
I'll be a figure head

1:31:37.025 --> 1:31:39.659
and most likely
they'll push me out.

1:31:39.661 --> 1:31:41.761
Bill: You can't just throw it
all away like this!

1:31:43.298 --> 1:31:46.099
So, basically,
what it all comes down to

1:31:46.101 --> 1:31:48.268
is your word against his.

1:31:48.270 --> 1:31:51.104
The word of a man
who even according to you

1:31:51.106 --> 1:31:55.609
is one of the most respected
businessmen in the world.

1:31:55.611 --> 1:31:58.011
And that of a drug smuggler

1:31:58.013 --> 1:31:59.980
and government informant.

1:31:59.982 --> 1:32:02.949
[dramatic music]

1:32:09.391 --> 1:32:10.857
Okay, we've got
about 30 seconds.

1:32:10.859 --> 1:32:12.392
[indistinct chatter]

1:32:14.796 --> 1:32:16.296
Benedict: Come on.

1:32:16.298 --> 1:32:19.566
You know
the biggest mistake we made?

1:32:19.568 --> 1:32:22.736
[exhales] Making all the cars
the same color.

1:32:22.738 --> 1:32:25.705
Sure, they're futuristic
looking but...

1:32:25.707 --> 1:32:27.474
should've had a variety.

1:32:27.476 --> 1:32:29.676
Once we secure the company,
we're going to come out

1:32:29.678 --> 1:32:30.977
with a whole range of colors

1:32:30.979 --> 1:32:33.914
and it's going to be amazing.

1:32:33.916 --> 1:32:35.549
Are you okay, John?

1:32:36.351 --> 1:32:38.151
[sighs] Sure.

1:32:40.889 --> 1:32:43.723
You know, I never thanked you
properly, Jim,

1:32:43.725 --> 1:32:45.725
and I always meant to.

1:32:50.032 --> 1:32:51.498
W... Hey...

1:32:53.001 --> 1:32:54.568
[intense music]

1:32:56.505 --> 1:32:57.904
Don't do this, John.

1:32:58.941 --> 1:33:01.074
Just go home to Cristina.

1:33:01.076 --> 1:33:03.209
Work somethin' else out.

1:33:03.211 --> 1:33:04.778
I'll go in here alone and just

1:33:04.780 --> 1:33:07.347
call the whole thing off,
alright?

1:33:07.349 --> 1:33:09.316
No, you're missing the point.

1:33:10.786 --> 1:33:14.087
John DeLorean always leads
from the front.

1:33:14.089 --> 1:33:16.089
That's why he's John DeLorean.

1:33:17.559 --> 1:33:20.860
Right?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:33:20.862 --> 1:33:22.829
[knocking on door]

1:33:35.711 --> 1:33:37.811
John, glad you could make it.

1:33:37.813 --> 1:33:40.213
- This is John Vicenza.
- Hello. Alright.

1:33:41.717 --> 1:33:43.817
- Heard a lot about you, John.
Vicenza: Hi.

1:33:43.819 --> 1:33:45.251
Vicenza: Kind of a different
world for you, huh?

1:33:45.253 --> 1:33:49.289
Well, you'd be surprised.

1:33:49.291 --> 1:33:52.425
I, uh, took the opportunity
of ordering some champagne.

1:33:52.427 --> 1:33:56.830
Well, [chuckles] it, it seems
like a day for champagne, huh?

1:34:01.303 --> 1:34:02.969
Benedict: Now...

1:34:02.971 --> 1:34:04.471
[DeLorean chuckles]

1:34:10.579 --> 1:34:14.447
Um, are the, uh,

1:34:14.449 --> 1:34:16.516
are the, uh, monkeys here?

1:34:16.518 --> 1:34:17.984
[chuckles] Some.

1:34:17.986 --> 1:34:20.120
Uh, the rest are downstairs.

1:34:20.122 --> 1:34:21.588
John: Mm-hm.

1:34:24.259 --> 1:34:27.227
[dramatic music]

1:34:35.504 --> 1:34:36.770
Oh!

1:34:36.772 --> 1:34:39.739
[laughing]

1:34:41.877 --> 1:34:43.877
We got a quite a party here.

1:34:49.151 --> 1:34:51.451
It's, uh...

1:34:53.455 --> 1:34:55.121
Go ahead, John.

1:34:58.026 --> 1:34:59.359
Pick it up.

1:34:59.361 --> 1:35:02.362
[dramatic music]

1:35:26.822 --> 1:35:28.688
Well, that's better than gold.

1:35:28.690 --> 1:35:31.257
Gold weighs more than that,
for goodness sakes.

1:35:31.259 --> 1:35:32.659
[both laughing]

1:35:34.396 --> 1:35:38.264
So, here's to, uh,
to a lot of success for everyone

1:35:38.266 --> 1:35:41.735
and, uh, for all those,
those phone calls.

1:35:43.004 --> 1:35:45.405
Huh? Jim?

1:35:46.675 --> 1:35:47.774
Thank you.

1:35:47.776 --> 1:35:49.776
[mellow music]

1:35:53.849 --> 1:35:57.517
Hi, John. Jerry West.
I'm with the FBI.

1:35:57.519 --> 1:36:00.353
You're under arrest
for narcotic laws violation.

1:36:00.355 --> 1:36:02.322
[music continues]

1:36:06.595 --> 1:36:09.262
I, um, I don't understand.

1:36:09.264 --> 1:36:11.030
I'm going to advise you
of your rights.

1:36:11.032 --> 1:36:12.599
You have the right
to remain silent.

1:36:12.601 --> 1:36:14.467
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1:36:14.469 --> 1:36:15.702
in a court of law.

1:36:15.704 --> 1:36:17.203
You have the right
to an attorney.

1:36:17.205 --> 1:36:19.706
If you can't afford one,
one will be provided.

1:36:19.708 --> 1:36:21.307
Do you understand your rights?

1:36:26.381 --> 1:36:28.348
[intense music]

1:36:30.752 --> 1:36:33.653
John Z. DeLorean, former top
executive with General Motors

1:36:33.655 --> 1:36:35.655
more recently the creator
of a slick sports car

1:36:35.657 --> 1:36:37.123
that bore his name,

1:36:37.125 --> 1:36:39.392
today faced federal drug charges
in Los Angeles.

1:36:39.394 --> 1:36:42.962
John DeLorean, the flamboyant
former GM executive

1:36:42.964 --> 1:36:45.632
remains in custody tonight
on federal drug charges.

1:36:45.634 --> 1:36:47.967
Man on TV: They found several
pounds of cocaine.

1:36:47.969 --> 1:36:49.435
Don Oliver on TV: The FBI
would rather call it

1:36:49.437 --> 1:36:50.937
an undercover investigation

1:36:50.939 --> 1:36:54.240
but it was a semi-classic
sting operation.

1:36:54.242 --> 1:36:57.243
The FBI agent said DeLorean
had been under surveillance

1:36:57.245 --> 1:36:58.845
for five months.

1:36:58.847 --> 1:37:00.346
Man on TV: $24 million
cocaine deal.

1:37:00.348 --> 1:37:02.248
The FBI says, he was the...

1:37:02.250 --> 1:37:05.218
[indistinct chatter on TV]

1:37:07.289 --> 1:37:09.088
Man on TV: DeLorean claims
Jim trapped him

1:37:09.090 --> 1:37:12.425
in the drug deal, while FBI
agents posing as drug dealers

1:37:12.427 --> 1:37:14.294
open a suitcase full of cocaine.

1:37:14.296 --> 1:37:17.864
They could receive federal
prison terms of up to 15 years.

1:37:17.866 --> 1:37:21.868
Driven and finally desperate
for success.

1:37:21.870 --> 1:37:24.871
Woman on TV: DeLorean himself is
out of jail on bail

1:37:24.873 --> 1:37:28.541
in California. We have more
on that from Dennis Murphy.

1:37:28.543 --> 1:37:30.877
Dennis on TV: Last night wearing
the same suit he was arrested in

1:37:30.879 --> 1:37:33.146
eleven days before,
John DeLorean walked

1:37:33.148 --> 1:37:35.815
from federal prison
and embraced his wife.

1:37:35.817 --> 1:37:37.350
His travel
is restricted to parts

1:37:37.352 --> 1:37:39.152
of California and New York.

1:37:39.154 --> 1:37:41.754
DeLorean 's next court
appearance is in a week...

1:37:43.391 --> 1:37:45.391
[dog barking]

1:37:45.393 --> 1:37:48.394
[instrumental music]

1:38:08.550 --> 1:38:10.550
You fell for it.

1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:13.720
Fell for what?

1:38:17.192 --> 1:38:18.725
Jesus, John, what are you doing?

1:38:18.727 --> 1:38:20.727
I'd be within my rights
to shoot you dead.

1:38:20.729 --> 1:38:22.929
John, don't be an idiot. Okay?

1:38:22.931 --> 1:38:24.864
It's only gonna
make things worse. Just stop.

1:38:24.866 --> 1:38:26.099
[gun clicks]

1:38:30.505 --> 1:38:32.805
It's not really my style.

1:38:34.709 --> 1:38:36.309
[sighs]

1:38:42.350 --> 1:38:43.750
How are you, Jim?

1:38:45.253 --> 1:38:46.653
I'm okay.

1:38:48.089 --> 1:38:49.522
You?

1:38:49.524 --> 1:38:50.757
[chuckles]

1:38:55.563 --> 1:38:56.863
How's Cristina?

1:38:58.533 --> 1:39:01.200
Well, she's hired a designer
to make her a new outfit

1:39:01.202 --> 1:39:03.469
for everyday of the trial.

1:39:03.471 --> 1:39:06.372
That's gonna be
a long trial so...

1:39:06.374 --> 1:39:07.774
That's what we in the automobile
industry

1:39:07.776 --> 1:39:09.943
call an exit strategy.

1:39:11.112 --> 1:39:12.645
Sorry to hear that.

1:39:16.818 --> 1:39:19.018
- John, I'm sorry about--
- No.

1:39:20.422 --> 1:39:22.822
Don't.

1:39:22.824 --> 1:39:25.825
You saw an opportunity
and you took it.

1:39:28.630 --> 1:39:31.030
I trust you were amply rewarded.

1:39:36.137 --> 1:39:37.370
No.

1:39:39.307 --> 1:39:42.175
Boy, they always find a way
to fuck us, don't they?

1:39:47.849 --> 1:39:49.048
Yeah.

1:39:50.986 --> 1:39:53.987
[intense music]

1:39:59.127 --> 1:40:01.294
<i> Benedict: Stay focused.</i>

1:40:01.296 --> 1:40:02.929
<i> Stay calm.</i>

1:40:02.931 --> 1:40:05.164
<i> Stay honest.</i>

1:40:05.166 --> 1:40:07.333
<i> Look them in the eye.</i>

1:40:07.335 --> 1:40:10.203
<i> Be polite and respect.</i>

1:40:10.205 --> 1:40:13.473
Howard: Mr. Hoffman,
i-- it's quite simple,

1:40:13.475 --> 1:40:17.810
did John DeLorean suggest
the drug deal?

1:40:17.812 --> 1:40:20.613
Because if he did, then he is
a willing participant.

1:40:20.615 --> 1:40:23.449
But if he didn't,
then he is the victim

1:40:23.451 --> 1:40:26.619
of an outrageous FBI entrapment.

1:40:26.621 --> 1:40:29.589
[dramatic music]

1:40:32.861 --> 1:40:34.360
So, which is it?

1:40:34.362 --> 1:40:37.196
Did John DeLorean suggest
the drug deal?

1:40:39.734 --> 1:40:41.000
Jim: Well...

1:40:41.002 --> 1:40:43.970
[music continues]

1:40:54.816 --> 1:40:57.650
[mellow music]

1:40:57.652 --> 1:40:59.819
Can you help me, Jim?

1:41:08.897 --> 1:41:10.229
Well, it's hard to say.

1:41:10.231 --> 1:41:13.232
[indistinct chatter]

1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:20.173
[indistinct whispering]

1:41:26.081 --> 1:41:29.449
Judge Takasugi: Settle.
Settle down.

1:41:49.404 --> 1:41:52.705
"The United States of America
versus John Z. DeLorean.

1:41:52.707 --> 1:41:55.074
We, the jury, in the above
entitled case,

1:41:55.076 --> 1:41:58.277
find the defendant,
John Z. DeLorean, not guilty

1:41:58.279 --> 1:42:00.313
as charged in count one.

1:42:00.315 --> 1:42:03.382
Not guilty as charged
in count two.

Not guilty as charged
in count three.

1:42:17.732 --> 1:42:20.700
[indistinct chatter]

1:42:31.346 --> 1:42:32.979
Woman: Mr. DeLorean,
will you plan

1:42:32.981 --> 1:42:34.814
to resume your career
in the auto industry?

1:42:34.816 --> 1:42:36.516
Would you buy
a used car from me?

1:42:36.518 --> 1:42:38.317
[all laughing]

1:42:39.754 --> 1:42:43.022
All you had to say was
it was his idea.

1:42:43.024 --> 1:42:44.724
That's all you had to do.

1:42:47.929 --> 1:42:51.330
Well, you and your family
can kiss goodbye to California.

1:42:53.001 --> 1:42:56.802
And say hello to Boise, Idaho.

1:42:56.804 --> 1:42:59.105
Because that's where witness
protection is sending you.

1:43:00.208 --> 1:43:02.008
I'll make sure of that.

1:43:02.010 --> 1:43:03.709
It's been a long journey,
but in the end,

1:43:03.711 --> 1:43:06.145
I think justice was served.
Okay. Thank you, everyone.

1:43:19.627 --> 1:43:21.861
Oh, that's a big help. Thanks.

1:43:21.863 --> 1:43:24.497
Ellen: Jim. The phone's for you.

1:43:24.499 --> 1:43:26.132
Can you pick it up?

1:43:29.337 --> 1:43:30.703
Honey?

1:43:32.907 --> 1:43:34.907
Babe, the phone's for you.

1:43:36.844 --> 1:43:38.978
Jim: Hello?

1:43:38.980 --> 1:43:41.047
Okay. Okay, leaving now.

1:43:41.049 --> 1:43:42.548
Alright. Bye.

1:44:12.580 --> 1:44:14.313
Hello, John.

1:44:21.422 --> 1:44:23.122
How are you doing?

1:44:25.260 --> 1:44:28.261
My name will live in infamy.
But I'm free.

1:44:29.931 --> 1:44:32.098
And single.

1:44:37.472 --> 1:44:40.339
I guess not everyone needs
a DeLorean.

1:44:41.242 --> 1:44:43.209
[both laughing]

1:44:44.812 --> 1:44:46.812
Oh, that's good, that's good.

1:44:50.885 --> 1:44:53.352
Mm, so, wh... Now, what?
What, uh...

1:44:54.722 --> 1:44:58.090
Well, I'm designing another car

1:44:58.092 --> 1:45:00.760
and this one is gonna have
all the bits

1:45:00.762 --> 1:45:04.964
I was forced to leave out in the
last one and it's gonna be...

1:45:04.966 --> 1:45:06.799
It's gonna be really special.

1:45:08.403 --> 1:45:10.036
Oh, you mean...

1:45:11.773 --> 1:45:13.472
something like that?

1:45:17.312 --> 1:45:20.313
[instrumental music]

1:45:23.284 --> 1:45:24.817
Figured I'd hold onto that
for you

1:45:24.819 --> 1:45:27.219
on the off chance
you might want it back someday.

1:45:36.764 --> 1:45:38.097
It means a lot, Jim.

1:45:38.099 --> 1:45:40.566
[music continues]

1:45:49.711 --> 1:45:51.877
Well, I've got to...

1:46:01.823 --> 1:46:04.790
