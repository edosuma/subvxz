00:02.040 --> 00:03.679
<i>Last season, on</i> The Flash.

00:03.760 --> 00:05.274
Melt.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.473
<i>- Killer Frost...</i>
- Is gone.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.598
It says there's still another
cryogenic anomaly in my DNA.

00:10.680 --> 00:11.936
Killer Frost
is still a part of you.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.713
Hang on.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.598
<i>That's me, right there.</i>

00:15.680 --> 00:17.637
<i>Killer Frost,
she was part of you.</i>

00:17.720 --> 00:19.393
<i>Even then.</i>

00:19.480 --> 00:20.800
How is that possible?

00:20.880 --> 00:22.792
To the newest member
of Team Flash.

00:22.880 --> 00:23.996
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.230
We need to talk.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.357
- Who are you?
- I'm your daughter, Nora.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.800
<i>Sally's in a decaying orbit.</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:30.296
<i>Okay, how do we
stop something</i>

00:30.320 --> 00:32.016
that's going to send us
back into the Stone Age?

00:32.040 --> 00:33.776
<i>Barry, you've got
to destroy that satellite.</i>

00:35.360 --> 00:36.510
<i>That satellite...</i>

00:36.600 --> 00:38.478
<i>it wasn'tjust me
who took it down.</i>

00:38.600 --> 00:40.637
<i>There was another speedster.</i>

00:40.720 --> 00:42.951
<i>Okay, let's back up.</i>

00:44.160 --> 00:46.038
<i>My name is Nora West-Allen,</i>

00:46.120 --> 00:47.918
<i>the fastest woman alive.</i>

00:48.000 --> 00:49.957
<i>When I'm from,
30 years from now,</i>

00:50.040 --> 00:52.157
<i>I'm the guardian
of Central City.</i>

00:52.280 --> 00:55.034
<i>I'm a speedster,
just like my dad.</i>

00:55.120 --> 00:57.157
<i>People call me XS.</i>

00:59.280 --> 01:01.840
<i>Every day, I hope to live up
to the legacy of The Flash...</i>

01:05.600 --> 01:08.877
<i>But I've still got
a long way to go.</i>

01:16.280 --> 01:17.760
You're saying
you're our daughter?

01:17.840 --> 01:20.196
From the future?

01:20.280 --> 01:21.919
Named Nora?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.196
After your mother.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.034
Anybody need a refill?

01:27.920 --> 01:29.718
No?
Just me?

01:31.480 --> 01:32.709
Mm.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.154
<i>Cisco Ramon,</i>

01:34.280 --> 01:36.476
always cutting the tension
with a joke.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.194
You know our names?

01:39.280 --> 01:41.431
Of course.
I know all of you.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.876
You're Caitlin Snow,
Ralph Dibny,

01:43.960 --> 01:46.191
Papa Joe, Mama Cecile.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.680
Little Auntie Jenna.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.910
She's so cute.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.195
And Uncle Wally.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.875
Uh, and your nickname is XS?

01:52.960 --> 01:54.440
Clearly not my doing.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.000
No, uh, it's a nickname

01:56.080 --> 01:59.437
that you gave me
when I was a kid, Mom.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.079
"Mom"?

02:01.160 --> 02:04.119
You said I did
everything in excess.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.396
Guess I've always
been like that.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.035
Overdoing things,
getting in way over my head.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.157
Like, uh, recently.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.879
This mistake that you made?

02:12.960 --> 02:14.076
Big mistake.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.514
Which was...

02:15.600 --> 02:17.034
Helping you save the city

02:17.120 --> 02:19.430
by destroying the STAR Labs
satellite last night.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.749
You were the other speedster?

02:20.840 --> 02:22.115
I just couldn't
stop myself

02:22.200 --> 02:24.396
from getting involved.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.120
But something happened
when I did, because now,

02:27.200 --> 02:30.113
I can't seem to go fast enough
to open up the Speed Force.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.634
Par... pardon me.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.916
Are we talking about
actual time travel here?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.560
Do you just like,
not pay any attention

02:36.640 --> 02:38.040
when we have our briefings?

02:38.120 --> 02:39.998
Y'all didn't teach him
about the Legends?

02:40.080 --> 02:42.311
Look, nobody said bubkes
about time travel.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.874
Shh, shh, shh. Oh!

02:44.960 --> 02:46.096
Come on, Ralph.
You're scaring the baby.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.176
<i>Yeah, you're scaring the baby.</i>

02:48.880 --> 02:50.519
No, no, she's not scared.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.954
She just said she's hungry.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.751
She said that she's...
Joe!

02:56.840 --> 02:58.160
I heard her!

02:58.280 --> 03:00.476
<i>I read her mind!</i>

03:00.560 --> 03:02.597
I might not
be losing my powers!

03:02.680 --> 03:05.718
I might not be losing
my powers!

03:05.800 --> 03:07.519
Awesome.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.353
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

03:09.440 --> 03:12.160
I know how bizarre
this must seem,

03:12.240 --> 03:16.757
meeting your daughter
from the future as an adult.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.951
But really, this wasn't
my plan at all,

03:19.040 --> 03:21.839
but I'm kind of stuck here now,

03:21.920 --> 03:24.196
and you're the only people
who can help me.

03:24.280 --> 03:28.320
So... anybody know what to do?

03:38.120 --> 03:43.275
This is so, so weird.

03:43.360 --> 03:49.118
Yeah, I mean, I can't believe
that's our daughter up there.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.557
- We have been lied to before.
- Barry.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.599
Yellow lightning like yours,
purple lightning like mine?

03:55.680 --> 03:57.717
I mean, it's...
it's got to be her.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.435
We're meeting our daughter
for the first time, Barry.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.273
Yeah, well, look.
If it is true, Nora

04:05.360 --> 04:08.398
could say the wrong thing
or step on the wrong butterfly

04:08.480 --> 04:10.153
and screw up
the whole timeline.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.336
I mean, she could Marty McFly
herself out of existence.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.431
Mm, <i>Terminator 2,</i> yeah.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.118
No, that's <i>Back to the...</i>
It doesn't matter.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.192
Look, we just need to
be responsible, all right?

04:20.320 --> 04:22.456
I mean, I think we need to find
a way to send her home, fast.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.676
Barry, don't you think
future us taught our daughter

04:24.760 --> 04:26.558
how not to screw
with the timeline?

04:28.240 --> 04:31.836
Wow, this Speed Lab
sure is archaic, huh?

04:31.920 --> 04:33.354
La-la-la-la-la,
you don't know...

04:33.440 --> 04:34.999
you know what, um...

04:35.080 --> 04:36.656
Sorry, just... no future talk,
all right, please?

04:36.680 --> 04:39.149
Right, I don't want
to wreck the timeline.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.471
- Right.
- All right, Nora.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.392
This is gonna link us up
with your biometrics.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.834
Ow!

04:44.920 --> 04:47.276
And this little
scrunchy doohicky

04:47.360 --> 04:50.558
is gonna analyze your
connection to the, um, uh...

04:50.640 --> 04:51.790
The Speed Force.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.599
The Speed Force.
Thank you.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.716
Great.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.757
I'll be back in a... flash.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.714
And what does it say?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.439
A quick analysis
of her DNA shows

05:04.520 --> 05:06.671
patterns that are similar
to both of yours.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.400
I knew it.
She's our daughter.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.233
What about her
being stuck here?

05:11.320 --> 05:12.549
Everything's normal.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.677
She definitely has
Speed Force in her system.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.877
She's just not going...
fast enough

05:17.000 --> 05:19.674
to, uh, open up
a time portal, so.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.480
How much champagne did you
have at Joe and Cecile's?

05:22.560 --> 05:25.519
This is the first
opportunity I have

05:25.600 --> 05:28.832
to process my breakup
with Gypsy, okay?

05:28.920 --> 05:30.354
<i>How was I supposed to know</i>

05:30.440 --> 05:31.874
that your future daughter

05:31.960 --> 05:33.553
was gonna come show up

05:33.640 --> 05:34.994
and crash my pity party?

05:35.080 --> 05:36.833
<i>How was I supposed
to "ancipitate" that?</i>

05:38.600 --> 05:40.080
Crap, I was supposed
to meet Singh

05:40.160 --> 05:41.640
- at CCPD an hour ago.
- Okay.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.074
Hey, Wally, can you
do me a favor?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.456
Can you take the sample
to the Legends

05:44.480 --> 05:45.656
to see if they
have any insight?

05:45.680 --> 05:46.920
And maybe,
worst comes to worst,

05:46.960 --> 05:48.056
we can take her home
on the Waverider?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.355
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.960
Okay, just...
I'll hurry back.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.594
Keep an eye on her.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.915
<i>New ID, keys to the lab.</i>

06:06.000 --> 06:08.595
You are officially reinstated
as our CSI tech, Allen.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.040
Thanks, Captain.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.510
Oh, one more thing.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.896
We didn't fill your position
while you were away,

06:14.920 --> 06:17.276
so there are a few cases
waiting for you in your lab.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.597
<i>Get to them fast as you can.</i>

06:20.680 --> 06:22.034
<i>Welcome back, Allen.</i>

06:27.080 --> 06:29.311
"A few"?

06:31.520 --> 06:32.840
- Ahh!
- What you working on?

06:32.920 --> 06:36.152
- I don't...
- You are crazy behind.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.240
Hey, so I thought you were
gonna stay at STAR Labs,

06:38.320 --> 06:40.710
with, um... with your...

06:40.800 --> 06:42.598
Iris... mom.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.353
With your mom.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.159
You know
I'm a forensic scientist too?

06:46.240 --> 06:49.153
CCU grad, just like you.
5.6 GPA.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.754
I could help you
get through this.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.718
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, it's...

06:54.040 --> 06:56.953
So the fire marshal
at this site says

06:57.040 --> 07:00.431
crazing in the melted glass
suggests a liquid accelerant.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.194
Mm, any petroleum-based
household product

07:03.280 --> 07:05.112
could cause crazing.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.034
Well, like floor wax,
or shag rugs, even balloons.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.874
Yeah, the glass
melts under the surface,

07:10.960 --> 07:15.000
like ice cream in the cracks
of a waffle cone.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.271
Oh, like when
you get two scoops

07:17.360 --> 07:19.636
of cookie dough ice cream
with extra sprinkles

07:19.720 --> 07:21.552
<i>at the Mason Family
Ice Cream Shop in...</i>

07:21.640 --> 07:23.791
Happy Harbor, Rhode Island.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.349
My parents used to
take me there when I was a kid.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.473
It's my favorite dessert.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.795
Mine too.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.433
Hey, look, I'm sorry,
um, you're obviously

07:42.520 --> 07:45.194
good at forensics,
but you shouldn't interfere.

07:45.280 --> 07:49.433
I mean, people like us,
we need to be responsible.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.796
Right! Uh, timeline.

07:51.880 --> 07:52.996
The timeline, yeah.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.480
<i>All available units,</i>

07:54.560 --> 07:56.119
<i>M-0-3 in progress,
10th and Neely.</i>

07:56.200 --> 07:58.112
M-0-3, that's a meta attack.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.600
Yeah, my suit's all torn up.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.273
I don't have anything to...

08:01.360 --> 08:03.317
Direct from Cisco's
back closet.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.518
One first-edition
red emblem OG super suit.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.432
Total fan favorite.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.159
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.755
Uh, I'm...
I'm gonna handle this.

08:12.840 --> 08:13.840
You just... no, no, no.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.118
Uh, you... stay.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.429
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.000
Seriously, please.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.276
Now I'm gonna...

08:42.480 --> 08:44.119
Going old-school
today, Flash?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.590
Yeah, it's a little tighter
than I remember, though.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.712
Hey, uh, you might
want to do something.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.156
Now it's my turn, Flash.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.718
Gridlock? Schway!

09:05.800 --> 09:07.029
- What are you doing?
<i>- No, no.</i>

09:07.120 --> 09:09.077
I just... I just wanted...

09:13.960 --> 09:15.280
Nice.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.156
Oh, grife.
You're mad at me.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.596
No, Nora, we're not.
We're just...

09:40.680 --> 09:42.239
Please don't say
"disappointed."

09:42.320 --> 09:43.800
That's so much worse.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.576
I mean, I just didn't think
it was a big deal.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.273
It was only Gridlock.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.680
Oh, Gridlock, huh?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.399
Boy, the future's got some
great names.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.835
This lighting!

09:52.920 --> 09:54.593
How did you know
who he is?

09:54.680 --> 09:55.796
Flash Museum.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.712
Did you say...

09:57.800 --> 09:59.200
- "Flash Museum"?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

09:59.280 --> 10:02.751
It has all the villains and
battles in chronological order.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.399
I've studied everything.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.199
So you know this guy's
real name?

10:07.280 --> 10:09.033
Mr. Myles, the curator,

10:09.120 --> 10:11.396
he scrubbed all the names
for legal reasons.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.755
But it really shouldn't matter.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.236
I mean, Gridlock
was a one-and-done.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.277
You guys beat him in one try,

10:17.360 --> 10:19.875
or at least...
you were supposed to.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.350
Ugh, now, because of me,
he's on the run,

10:22.440 --> 10:24.955
and the timeline's
all messed up again, and I...

10:25.040 --> 10:26.520
Nora, hey, look, look.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.718
I've made way bigger mistakes
than this time traveling.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.696
We'll get this guy... you don't
need to worry about that...

10:31.720 --> 10:33.496
but the longer you stay here,
the more things might change.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.795
We need to get you home.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.111
But I can't go fast enough
to get home.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.358
What about the tachyon
absorption enhancer?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.056
The one that Thawne used
to increase his speed?

10:42.080 --> 10:43.753
Ooh, and if we charge it up,

10:43.840 --> 10:45.877
we could uh, boost
the Speed Force in her cells,

10:45.960 --> 10:48.156
like some kind of, um...

10:48.240 --> 10:49.799
thing that boosts
Speed Force in cells.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.376
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a good idea.</i>

10:51.400 --> 10:52.993
Let's... okay,
finding Gridlock

10:53.080 --> 10:54.960
and getting Nora home
need to be our priorities.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.430
No, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.000
- Wait.
- Loud!

10:59.080 --> 11:03.154
Okay, so... but this
needs to be our priority.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.072
<i>Now, I realize that
you're all way ahead of me</i>

11:05.160 --> 11:06.753
in this time-travel business,
but guys,

11:06.840 --> 11:08.136
I think I just
discovered something.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.231
So if... if Nora can time travel,

11:10.320 --> 11:13.597
that means she can create
new timelines, right?

11:13.680 --> 11:18.357
New timelines means that
parallel timelines can exist.

11:18.440 --> 11:24.676
So, guys, I think that a whole
other universe could exist.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.114
<i>I know, I know, I know.</i>

11:26.200 --> 11:27.416
<i>It sounds crazy,
but think about it.</i>

11:27.440 --> 11:30.353
There could be an Earth
where we're all bad guys,

11:30.440 --> 11:33.114
or another Earth where
there's no world hunger,

11:33.200 --> 11:36.079
or... or another Earth where...

11:36.160 --> 11:39.039
where they never made that
last "Indiana Jones" movie.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.359
Think of the possibilities.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.511
It's like some kind
of a manyverse.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.878
And everybody knows
about the manyverse.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.112
Multiverse,
and so do you, Ralph.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.590
Breacher? Gypsy? Harry?

11:54.680 --> 11:55.816
What did you think we meant
when we said

11:55.840 --> 11:57.399
Harry was from Earth-2?

11:57.480 --> 12:00.552
That he is from Earth "also."

12:00.640 --> 12:01.960
Oh, my God.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.616
You guys really need to make,
like, a welcome pamphlet,

12:03.640 --> 12:05.597
or at least a PowerPoint
or something.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.353
<i>Hey, Ralph, buddy?</i>

12:07.440 --> 12:09.591
Can we get off time travel,
maybe, please?

12:09.680 --> 12:11.336
Let's focus on finding
Gridlock, all right?

12:11.360 --> 12:12.430
Thank you.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.590
I'm gonna go to CCPD,

12:13.680 --> 12:15.034
see what I can dig up.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.236
Okay, I'll stay with Nora.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.152
- Let's just make sure...
- I know.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.152
Protect the timeline.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.318
You thirsty?

12:27.280 --> 12:32.230
Okay, latte for me,
and a decaf Flash for you.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.039
Wow.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.635
Dad's lightning bolt is way
cooler than Lightning Lad's.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.877
And do you think
he's gonna be back soon?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.633
Well, you know your dad.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.235
Whenever there's a problem,
he's gotta run off and fix it.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.840
But, you know,

12:47.920 --> 12:51.391
this gives us
a chance to connect.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.195
You're not worried about
messing things up, like he is?

12:56.280 --> 12:59.114
I... well, I just, I...

12:59.200 --> 13:00.680
want to get to know you
a little.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.676
How about this?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.553
I will ask you questions

13:05.640 --> 13:08.474
about your life,
and if I'm right,

13:08.560 --> 13:11.280
you just blink twice.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.670
I mean, blinking never
broke the timeline, right?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.991
Okay, yeah, I mean,
if you really want to.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.992
Yeah, I think
it'll be really fun.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.356
Okay, um, so let's see.

13:20.440 --> 13:24.673
You are a reporter
for a newspaper

13:24.760 --> 13:27.320
that you can only read
on Instagram.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.672
Um, okay, you... you are a cop.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.595
You're a... a CSI?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.837
You're a CSI.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.754
Just like your dad.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.355
Okay, well,
what about you and I?

13:47.440 --> 13:50.080
Do we... do we, like,
have dinner every Sunday?

13:50.160 --> 13:51.514
Do we talk on the phone?

13:51.640 --> 13:53.438
Do we still get coffee
at Jitters?

13:55.600 --> 13:57.717
- Uh...
- Was that a blink?

13:57.800 --> 14:01.157
Uh, no, I just...
I have something in my eye.

14:02.960 --> 14:07.034
You know, a coffee in my time
at Jitters is $43 a cup.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.236
- Wow.
- That's one thing

14:08.320 --> 14:09.470
I really like about now.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.517
2018 is way schway.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.398
- "Schway"?
- Oh.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.312
Yeah, I guess it's
a future thing.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.835
Oh... oh, no. Oh, "schway."

14:17.960 --> 14:19.656
No, I know, I'm hip.
I know what schway means.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.036
Like, I'm schway,
you're schway.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.589
We're... we're schway, baby.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.479
Stupid.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.280
Do you think maybe Caitlin
and Cisco need any help?

14:36.560 --> 14:38.836
I can't believe I'm wearing
the same tachyon enhancer

14:38.920 --> 14:41.276
my dad used to meet Supergirl
for the first time.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.880
All set.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.520
Wait, what happened
to the second version?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.056
The smaller one that was
inside the emblem

14:47.080 --> 14:48.878
of my dad's second suit?

14:48.960 --> 14:51.077
Um, if he wore that one,
he could harness tachyons

14:51.200 --> 14:52.270
and share them with me.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.192
Hey, fangirl, relax.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.475
We know.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.392
Did all these suits shrink?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.551
And why does it smell so bad?

14:59.640 --> 15:01.438
Because it's the one you used

15:01.520 --> 15:03.751
when you swam against
King Shark.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.954
Flash!

15:07.040 --> 15:08.190
Zoom wants you dead!

15:08.280 --> 15:09.919
Yeah, yeah.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.798
I know King Shark
is technically a bad guy,

15:11.880 --> 15:13.917
but you should see...
just wait.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.878
- When he fights Grodd, it's...
- Um!

15:15.960 --> 15:17.440
Spoiler alert.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.998
We should get going,
actually, let's...

15:22.080 --> 15:23.080
Right.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.595
Then this is goodbye.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.798
From your guys'
perspectives, at least.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.873
I'll see you again
in a minute and 27 seconds,

15:31.960 --> 15:34.714
but when you see me again,
I'll be a baby.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.314
Get home safe, Nora.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.629
I'm sorry

15:37.720 --> 15:39.473
we didn't get to spend
more time together.

15:39.560 --> 15:40.560
Oh, it's fine, Mom.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.199
We spend our
whole lives together.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.070
All right.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.835
Did they already leave?

16:16.920 --> 16:18.149
Yeah, why?
What's up?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.390
We have to stop them.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.074
I'm sorry I was too late.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.616
<i>It took me a while to find
where the Legends were.</i>

16:49.640 --> 16:50.869
Well, when they were.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.440
<i>But we got their Gideon</i>

16:52.520 --> 16:54.079
to scan Nora's blood sample.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.437
- What'd she find?
- Negative tachyons.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.352
Negative tachyons?

16:59.440 --> 17:01.750
So, what, instead of speeding
you up, they slow you down?

17:03.680 --> 17:04.680
Yeah.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.240
Oh, damn, I was just joking.

17:06.319 --> 17:07.595
That's a real thing?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.280
Yeah, Ava and her team
at the Time Bureau

17:09.319 --> 17:10.896
have encountered them before,
but no one knows

17:10.920 --> 17:12.832
where they come from
or how they're generated.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.640
Like dark matter
for the space time continuum.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.194
Exactly, and they're
saturating Nora's body

17:18.280 --> 17:20.079
and keeping her from
entering the Speed Force.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.595
What about the Waverider?
Can the Legends take her back?

17:22.680 --> 17:24.239
If negative tachyons
come anywhere near

17:24.319 --> 17:25.674
the Rider's time drives,

17:25.760 --> 17:27.830
uh, the reaction
will vaporize the ship.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.456
Well, there's got to be a way
to get rid of them, right?

17:29.480 --> 17:30.856
I mean, I don't know
about getting rid of them,

17:30.880 --> 17:32.872
but maybe we can offset

17:32.960 --> 17:34.872
the tachyon
absorption enhancer

17:34.960 --> 17:37.111
to negate the reaction somehow.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.296
<i>A new meta
was last seen...</i>

17:38.320 --> 17:39.320
Hey, guys.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.656
<i>Jumping off a building
in order to</i>

17:40.680 --> 17:42.353
<i>evade capture
after stealing...</i>

17:42.440 --> 17:43.669
How did we miss this?

17:45.440 --> 17:47.671
I guess this is a parting gift
from DeVoe.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.176
Without our STAR Labs
satellite, we've lost

17:49.200 --> 17:51.396
our eyes, our ears,
our dark matter scanner,

17:51.480 --> 17:53.136
our facial recognition...
I mean, we're always

17:53.160 --> 17:54.760
gonna be one step
behind these metas now.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.956
I'll work on this.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.176
Why don't you guys
go help Ralph

17:57.200 --> 17:58.296
with the Gridlock
crime scene, okay?

17:58.320 --> 18:01.040
- Uh, I can come help.
- Please, no, just...

18:01.120 --> 18:03.112
we just can't let this
get any worse, all right?

18:05.320 --> 18:06.879
Just relax, okay?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.879
How's your
investigation going?

18:10.960 --> 18:12.679
Uh, it just
doesn't really add up.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.856
I mean, if Eddie wanted to
erase Thawne from existence,

18:14.880 --> 18:17.520
why didn't he just
have a vasectomy?

18:17.600 --> 18:19.478
Right, uh,
nobody's talking.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.096
<i>Probably because
they're afraid</i>

18:21.120 --> 18:22.554
<i>Gridlock will attack them.</i>

18:22.640 --> 18:24.871
Right, but maybe if I had
Killer Frost at my side,

18:24.960 --> 18:26.336
people would be
a little more willing

18:26.360 --> 18:27.953
to tell us what they know.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.396
Ralph, Killer Frost
has been gone

18:30.480 --> 18:32.836
since the night that DeVoe
took over your body.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.594
Jeez Louise,
no one tells me anything.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.353
- Is she gone for good?
- I hope not.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.079
But I've tried everything
I can think of

18:39.160 --> 18:40.435
to get her to reappear.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.113
You don't have
any other leads?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.119
Cisco vibed me back to when

18:46.200 --> 18:48.237
Killer Frost and I
were younger.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.880
You've been a meta
since you were a kid?

18:49.960 --> 18:51.440
- I guess so.
- How?

18:51.520 --> 18:53.989
- I have no idea.
- Did you see anything else?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.914
- Just that my dad was there.
- Well, that's something.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.832
Except my dad's
been dead for years.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.513
But none of this
matters right now.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.638
We have much more pressing
things to deal with.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.632
<i>Hey, come look at this.</i>

19:05.720 --> 19:07.279
<i>I present Gridlock.</i>

19:07.720 --> 19:09.359
A mystery in three acts.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.800
Please note
the dark matter levels.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.396
Act One, Gridlock attacks the
cops before Barry shows up.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.736
Okay, but these
dark matter levels

19:15.760 --> 19:17.216
are perfectly normal
for a man of his size.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.312
Until Act Two.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.790
He gets lightning punched
by Barry.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.633
His dark matter levels
increased.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.599
Which brings us
to our third and final act...

19:29.680 --> 19:31.034
Gridlock hits back.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.236
Even higher.

19:32.320 --> 19:33.754
How... how is that possible?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.400
It isn't, unless every time
Gridlock got hit,

19:36.480 --> 19:38.676
his cells absorbed
the kinetic energy.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.256
That would increase
his dark matter quotient,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.033
thereby increasing his powers.

19:42.120 --> 19:45.557
If this is true, then whatever
movement he's exposed to...

19:45.640 --> 19:46.994
The stronger he's gonna get.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.830
So, if Gridlock keeps moving,
he becomes unstoppable.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.035
So, figure it out yet?

20:02.120 --> 20:03.713
Whatever these negative
tachyons are,

20:03.800 --> 20:05.296
it feels a lot more
like science fiction

20:05.320 --> 20:06.720
than actual science.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.632
I wasn't asking
about the science.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.315
I was asking about
the scientist.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.759
You and Nora, you guys
have such a strong connection.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.435
I mean, it's...
it's effortless.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.991
So why are you so intent
on sending her back?

20:22.080 --> 20:24.515
I mean, what do you mean?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.576
First of all, she can't
stop talking about the future.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.594
But... I mean, you know
the danger that her being here

20:30.680 --> 20:32.034
poses to the timeline.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.796
Yeah, I do,
but I also know you, Barry.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.391
Look.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.439
You're the guy
that went back in time

20:42.520 --> 20:43.760
to borrow Snart before he died.

20:43.800 --> 20:44.800
I know.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.440
You're also the same guy
that travelled to 2020

20:47.520 --> 20:51.275
to figure out who Savitar was,
and 2015 to train with Wells.

20:51.360 --> 20:56.151
You changed fate
to save my life.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.675
So, now that our daughter
is here in front of us,

20:58.760 --> 21:00.672
asking for our help,
you expect me to believe

21:00.760 --> 21:02.433
that you're worried
about the timeline?

21:02.520 --> 21:04.637
Nora shouldn't be here.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.480
Look, I'm...

21:06.560 --> 21:09.598
- I've always wanted a family.
- I know.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.433
You know, and when
we got married,

21:11.520 --> 21:15.560
I knew that one day,
we'd decide to have a baby.

21:15.640 --> 21:20.476
We would try,
and you'd get pregnant.

21:20.560 --> 21:24.270
I'd be there for the sonogram,
I'd hear her first heartbeat,

21:24.360 --> 21:26.079
and then she'd come.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.870
And we'd take her home,
see her first smile,

21:29.960 --> 21:32.873
her first tooth,
the first time I read to her.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.956
Her first steps.
The first time she ran.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.679
But her being here now,
don't you feel like

21:41.760 --> 21:43.433
we missed all those firsts?

21:43.520 --> 21:45.034
That we skipped
all the good stuff?

21:45.120 --> 21:48.670
Baby, we will still have
all of those firsts.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.752
Just not in that order.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.071
But my whole life's
been out of order.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.436
These powers, time travel...

21:55.520 --> 21:57.796
that's the reason
my mom was killed,

21:57.880 --> 22:00.076
why I grew up
with my dad in prison.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.470
They missed so many firsts.
They missed our wedding.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.199
I know.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.960
I don't know, I just thought
that when it was our turn

22:11.040 --> 22:14.556
to have a kid,
that life would let us

22:14.640 --> 22:17.872
have this one little thing
the normal way.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.191
Just once.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.078
But we lost that chance.

22:22.160 --> 22:26.200
No, we're not losing anything
by having her here now.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.119
We're only gaining
something extra, Barry.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.075
And look,
if we figure this out,

22:33.160 --> 22:34.879
I mean, by the time
we do have a baby,

22:34.960 --> 22:39.079
we are gonna be
the best parents ever.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.959
- Maybe you're right.
- I know I'm right.

22:44.200 --> 22:48.194
You're gonna be there to put
that quarter under her pillow,

22:48.280 --> 22:49.714
and you're gonna be there

22:49.800 --> 22:51.837
to drive her to her
first day of school,

22:51.920 --> 22:56.153
and you're gonna be there
to cheer on her first run.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.436
And we are gonna have
all of those firsts.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.160
I promise.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.471
And think about it.

23:07.560 --> 23:12.032
We have a kid
who defied the laws of physics

23:12.160 --> 23:13.753
to hang out with her parents.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.799
I mean, that's pretty...
that's pretty schway.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.115
Yeah, as eager as she is,
you'd think that she's the one

23:22.200 --> 23:26.194
that grew up
with a parent in...

23:26.280 --> 23:29.398
What's wrong?

23:29.480 --> 23:31.517
Nothing.
Um, nothing.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.353
I'm... I'm gonna be right back.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.312
<i>Nora.</i>

23:54.680 --> 23:57.115
Um...

23:57.200 --> 23:59.874
What happens to me
in the future?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.754
You said that you spend
your whole life with your mom,

24:02.840 --> 24:06.470
but you didn't
say the same for me.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.155
My poker face
is that bad, huh?

24:09.240 --> 24:11.550
I need to know.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.912
How long?

24:36.920 --> 24:38.991
You never come back.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.714
How old were you
when it happened?

24:56.800 --> 25:00.316
I was born, um, a few years
before you vanished,

25:00.400 --> 25:04.360
but I don't have
any memories of you.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.597
So the wedding was...

25:06.680 --> 25:09.593
Was pretty much
the first time I met you.

25:09.680 --> 25:13.230
I'd imagined so many
different things to say to you.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.880
Still can't believe I went with
"Remember to say 'I do.'"

25:18.520 --> 25:21.433
I guess things don't always
go the way you plan them.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.917
You're not stuck here,
are you?

25:33.760 --> 25:36.480
I found it
in the museum archive.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.997
Negative tachyons,
harnessed on demand.

25:40.080 --> 25:44.313
Really should work
on that poker face, I guess.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.834
This didn't have to
be a secret.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.639
Why did you keep this from us?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.871
Because if you knew
I could have gone home,

25:49.960 --> 25:51.235
you would have sent me back

25:51.360 --> 25:53.272
the second I walked
into Grandpa's house.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.760
<i>I mean,
it's like you said, Dad.</i>

25:54.840 --> 25:56.832
<i>Speedsters have
to be responsible.</i>

25:57.560 --> 26:00.314
But... but I'm
not responsible, am I?

26:00.400 --> 26:04.076
I'm... just selfish

26:04.160 --> 26:09.838
and really, really bad
at being a speedster.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.474
Nora, you're not bad.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.520
I mean, I can do
some cool things, you know?

26:16.600 --> 26:19.399
Sometimes, I run so fast,
I reverse time a bit,

26:19.480 --> 26:22.075
but I can't do
the things you can.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.991
I don't even know
how to phase yet.

26:30.760 --> 26:35.198
Guess there's only so much
you can learn from a museum.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.031
What about your mom?

26:39.520 --> 26:41.830
Yeah, I... she's around,
you know?

26:41.920 --> 26:44.958
It's just, uh...
just me and her.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.514
I'm sorry.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.478
Yeah, I know.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.119
I shouldn't have lied.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.750
I just wanted
to see you so badly

26:54.880 --> 26:57.111
and spend a day with you.

26:57.200 --> 27:02.673
Go for a run
for the first time together.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.116
I missed all your firsts.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.232
I was so worried about
screwing up your childhood

27:12.320 --> 27:15.996
and screwing up
our family, but...

27:16.080 --> 27:17.958
I'm not even there.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.559
<i>Barry, we need you
in the Cortex.</i>

27:21.640 --> 27:23.791
<i>It's about Gridlock.</i>

27:23.880 --> 27:26.600
- I...
- I'm fine. Um...

27:26.680 --> 27:30.435
you need to go fix my mess,
and then I can go home.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.960
I scanned the crime scene
photos and got a match.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.117
This is not Lang's first rodeo.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.999
CCPD put out a warrant
for him for carjacking.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.434
He killed
the whole crew inside.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.074
And now he absorbs
kinetic energy?

27:50.160 --> 27:51.913
He only gets stronger
if you punch him,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.673
you shoot him,
you throw him into traffic.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.136
Which could only
make the traffic worse.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.958
God, I'd hate to be stuck
in that gridlock.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.636
Gridlock... Gridlock...

28:00.720 --> 28:02.996
I came up with the name.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.879
I am fortune's fool.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.920
So how do we find this guy
without Sally the satellite?

28:10.040 --> 28:12.999
We don't need a satellite
to hack a cell phone.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.673
And if we want to find his
cell phone, we'll find it...

28:19.560 --> 28:20.994
By the airport?

28:23.480 --> 28:26.040
Got it, 'cause he's on a plane
that just took off.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.794
Central City Air,
flight number 5201.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.237
Why would he get on a plane?

28:32.320 --> 28:34.073
Because he's gonna crash it.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.277
<i>We are currently cruising
at 34,000 feet.</i>

28:42.360 --> 28:43.874
<i>We anticipate
a smooth flight,</i>

28:43.960 --> 28:45.030
<i>so sit back and enjoy...</i>

28:45.160 --> 28:46.833
Excuse me, sir.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.513
If you could please
fasten your seatbelt

28:48.600 --> 28:49.840
until we reach
cruising altitude

28:49.880 --> 28:52.076
and the captain turns off
the seatbelt sign.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.872
Are you gonna buckle
that thing in too?

29:00.560 --> 29:01.960
Well, it must be
something priceless

29:02.040 --> 29:04.430
to get its own seat.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.512
Jewels, maybe.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.200
The plane just lost
an engine.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.391
It's headed for downtown.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.278
If Gridlock takes out
the other engine,

29:40.360 --> 29:41.856
the pilot won't be able
to avoid the buildings.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.593
Thousands of people will die.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.030
Not if you phase the plane
through the buildings.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.918
I read about you
doing the same thing

29:50.000 --> 29:53.311
to a plane in the future
when you were fighting Mob Rule.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.199
Can you two do that?

29:56.280 --> 29:58.112
A plane?

29:58.200 --> 29:59.839
No... I mean, no,
I don't think so.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.080
I mean, I think it's too big.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.319
The three of us.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.056
I mean, the three of us
might be able to do it.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.673
No, I can't phase anything.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.912
I can't even phase myself,
let alone at G-Force.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.111
Wait, G-For...
G-Force, that's it.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.793
The plane is still ascending.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.200
Once he blows up
the other engine,

30:19.240 --> 30:21.311
it's gonna slow down
and point downwards

30:21.400 --> 30:22.595
before it starts its descent.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.034
That'll give us
about ten seconds

30:24.120 --> 30:25.873
- of zero Gs on the plane.
- Yeah.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.216
And zero Gs
means no kinetic energy,

30:27.240 --> 30:28.720
means Gridlock has no powers.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.553
Can you breach them
onto the plane?

30:30.680 --> 30:31.796
A plane goes way too fast.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.200
I'd need to see it in person.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.839
- Then go.
- But I don't have a suit.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.559
I actually have a backup.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.632
I got more than just a list
of metas from that museum.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.076
Damn, Gina. I made that?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.992
Uh, Ryan Choi, actually.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.720
Oh, this is a supersuit.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.752
- No offense.
- None taken.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.256
Guys, he just took out
the other engine.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.560
You can do this.

31:31.600 --> 31:36.277
Uh, don't drink and vibe.
I feel like I'm gonna hurl.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.670
It's slowing.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.353
Guys, you've got
ten seconds.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.393
<i>Ten.</i>

31:48.480 --> 31:50.199
<i>Nine.</i>

31:50.280 --> 31:51.634
Eight.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.513
Seven.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.120
<i>Six.</i>

31:55.200 --> 31:57.476
<i>Five.</i>

31:57.600 --> 31:59.831
<i>Four.</i>

31:59.920 --> 32:02.196
<i>Three.</i>

32:02.280 --> 32:04.158
<i>Two.</i>

32:04.240 --> 32:05.276
<i>One.</i>

32:21.280 --> 32:23.511
Okay, everybody stay calm,
all right?

32:23.600 --> 32:25.637
Just stay calm.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.040
All right, come on.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.832
Hey, take a wall, all right?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.111
We got this.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.800
Barry, hurry.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.315
- It's not working.
- What?

32:54.560 --> 32:56.153
I can't do this.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.914
All right, yes...
listen to me, just breathe.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.274
Feel the floor
beneath your feet.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.635
Feel the rumble of the plane.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.473
Feel the air.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.791
Feel that wind on your face,

33:07.920 --> 33:09.752
<i>- and the lightning.</i>
- And the lightning.

33:09.880 --> 33:12.395
Feel its electricity
pumping through your veins,

33:12.480 --> 33:14.073
traveling to
every nerve in your body

33:14.160 --> 33:15.913
like a shock
you never want to end.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.136
<i>You are no longer you now.</i>

33:17.160 --> 33:18.196
You're no longer you.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.576
<i>You're part of
something greater.</i>

33:19.600 --> 33:21.034
You're part of
something greater.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.713
Part of the Speed Force.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.950
That's right.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.635
All right, it's ours.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.234
Now, let's do it.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.036
Everybody hold on!

33:56.640 --> 33:59.235
Hold on!

34:15.800 --> 34:17.712
Are you okay?

34:19.800 --> 34:21.917
Nice.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.478
You phased.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.233
For the first time!

34:39.280 --> 34:41.376
<i>Well, Gridlock's off
to Iron Heights' meta wing.</i>

34:41.400 --> 34:44.710
Where he won't be moving
from for a very long time.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.598
Thanks to your help.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.512
I'm glad we got to team up.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.875
Me too.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.553
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

34:51.639 --> 34:55.429
say hello to the tachyon
absorption enhancer 2.5,

34:55.520 --> 34:57.716
now complete with
completely recalibrated

34:57.800 --> 34:59.075
Time Bureau technology.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.669
We haven't tested it yet,
but it should counterbalance

35:01.760 --> 35:03.752
the negative tachyons
in Nora's cells.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.399
Here you go, Billy Pilgrim.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.790
Consider yourself
unstuck in time.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.599
So I can run home now?

35:09.680 --> 35:12.673
Or...

35:12.760 --> 35:15.275
maybe we hit pause
on this thing.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.829
You want Nora to stay?

35:17.920 --> 35:20.230
Um, yeah, I thought

35:20.320 --> 35:21.879
getting her home
was our priority.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.917
No, it is, I just...

35:24.000 --> 35:26.196
now, I'm thinking that
maybe we should make sure

35:26.280 --> 35:28.078
her powers
are working correctly

35:28.160 --> 35:30.356
before we send her home.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.949
And what about the timeline?

35:33.040 --> 35:34.360
It's risky, but I don't know.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.352
I mean, Wally and I
were talking about it.

35:36.440 --> 35:38.079
Yeah, the Legends
have a theory.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.880
Uh, there are some historical
events that are soft.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.314
Basically, you change those,

35:42.400 --> 35:44.153
it's not going
to affect much else,

35:44.240 --> 35:45.754
like catching Gridlock late.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.638
<i>And then, there are those
that are fixed.</i>

35:47.720 --> 35:50.440
You mess with them,
and all sorts of craziness

35:50.520 --> 35:51.670
starts to happen.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.194
Like the night my mom died.

35:53.280 --> 35:56.034
Changing that
created Flashpoint.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.794
It looks like Nora
is gonna need a place to stay.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.556
Uh, yes, and I'll stay
in the lounge.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.239
What lounge?

36:06.320 --> 36:07.834
This lounge.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.195
Ah.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.030
- Damn.
- Dad.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.476
- You found my spot.
- You knew about this?

36:20.560 --> 36:23.837
I've been napping in here
since day one.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.277
Uh, well, Nora
was gonna stay here,

36:27.360 --> 36:29.033
if that's all right with you.

36:29.120 --> 36:33.797
Okay, well, now I can
get to know my granddaughter.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.874
Mm.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.394
I'm sorry, you met Elvis?

36:43.480 --> 36:45.278
Met him?

36:45.360 --> 36:48.512
Uncle Wally fought the ghost
of his twin brother.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.757
I, uh... I went to a monastery,

36:50.840 --> 36:52.638
and I was trying
to find myself,

36:52.720 --> 36:54.200
but I was really close.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.960
Then, the Legends came,
they swooped me up,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.469
and life got even more crazy.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.711
You want to go back,
don't you?

37:00.800 --> 37:02.917
I can't.
I mean, I just got here.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.834
I don't want to leave the team.
I don't want to leave you.

37:05.920 --> 37:11.712
Wally, everybody in this room
loves you, especially me.

37:11.800 --> 37:16.750
But you didn't finish
what you set out to do,

37:16.840 --> 37:20.072
<i>and nobody's
gonna get in your way.</i>

37:21.720 --> 37:24.189
So promise me, when you find
what you're looking for,

37:24.280 --> 37:26.431
come back,
or you're gonna have

37:26.520 --> 37:29.831
a very angry-looking dad
in your Zen garden.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.119
Will you take care of him,
XS?

37:35.200 --> 37:36.873
You got it, Kid Flash.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.031
Hmm.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.597
You okay?

37:42.680 --> 37:44.637
Yeah.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.440
I thought I missed out on
my chance to connect with Nora,

37:47.520 --> 37:52.470
but now that she's staying,
I get another shot.

37:52.560 --> 37:54.472
If you could have seen her
on that plane,

37:54.560 --> 37:56.438
you'd know that you guys
are already connected.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.671
Really?

37:58.760 --> 38:02.720
She was fearless,
just like you.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.672
- We have a daughter together.
- Yeah.

38:10.760 --> 38:14.037
We make a person.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.716
In the end,
everything works out.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.871
We get our happy ending.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.200
Hey.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.078
If Barry can go back in time,

38:35.160 --> 38:38.392
why didn't he stop
the Thinker from killing me?

38:38.480 --> 38:39.709
Kidding, I'm kidding.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.950
Guys, I'm kidding.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.256
I realize that could have upset

38:42.280 --> 38:44.033
the delicate balance
of the universe.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.480
Besides, if he did that,
who knows?

38:45.560 --> 38:47.597
He might have created
a timeline where

38:47.720 --> 38:49.996
I died in that particle
accelerator explosion.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.639
Wishful thinking.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.632
Kidding.
I'm glad you're here,

38:53.720 --> 38:55.296
and I'm glad that we don't
have to hold your hand

38:55.320 --> 38:56.896
through the time travel thing;
you're figuring it out.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.515
Yeah, well, time travel's
not the only mystery I solved.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.656
While you guys
were fighting Gridlock,

39:00.680 --> 39:03.912
I was, uh, running this down.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.913
- What's this?
- An answer.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.593
And a lot more questions.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.360
It's my father's
death certificate.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.511
<i>A friend at county
helped me out with that.</i>

39:18.600 --> 39:22.276
The ME who signed off on it,
Cameron Mahkent?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.158
He doesn't exist.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.959
So then,
this death certificate...

39:26.040 --> 39:28.191
Is a fake.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.874
You should get some rest.
You've had a long day.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.440
Ooh, I'll try.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.597
I'm just so excited.
Like, literally.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.036
Phasing excited all of
the electron clouds in my body.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.918
Well, if you're not tired,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.560
two scoops of cookie dough
ice cream sound good right now.

39:45.640 --> 39:46.676
From Happy Harbor?

39:46.760 --> 39:48.433
If that's okay with you.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.272
It is, yeah.

39:52.360 --> 39:55.034
Just, uh, bring me back
some mint chip.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.672
<i>My name is Nora West-Allen,</i>

40:03.760 --> 40:05.877
<i>and I'm the
fastest woman alive.</i>

40:05.960 --> 40:07.872
<i>When I was a child,
my father disappeared</i>

40:07.960 --> 40:09.633
<i>in something impossible.</i>

40:09.760 --> 40:13.231
<i>Then I grew up
and became the impossible.</i>

40:13.320 --> 40:16.074
<i>Now I'm trying to live up
to the legacy he created</i>

40:16.160 --> 40:19.392
<i>so that one day, I'll stop him
from ever disappearing.</i>

40:19.520 --> 40:21.239
<i>I'm XS.</i>

40:21.320 --> 40:23.596
<i>How schway is that?</i>

40:55.000 --> 40:57.356
<i>CCPD!
Stay where you are.</i>

40:57.440 --> 40:58.954
<i>Freeze, don't move.</i>

41:30.200 --> 41:32.590
Who the hell are you?

41:35.800 --> 41:38.634
Wh... what do you want?

41:39.360 --> 41:43.115
For all of you to die.

42:21.680 --> 42:23.080
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
