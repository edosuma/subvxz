01:24.840 --> 01:28.880
THE DAY BEFORE

01:37.960 --> 01:40.880
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:35.200 --> 02:39.360
Today, the mayor will confirm
his resignation definitively.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.560
As of tomorrow,
Rome gears up for new elections,

02:42.640 --> 02:44.520
even though the parties haven't shared

02:44.600 --> 02:47.640
information regarding
potential candidates.

02:47.720 --> 02:48.560
Hello?

02:48.640 --> 02:51.200
We hope one candidate will emerge
from numerous parties in play

02:51.280 --> 02:53.960
capable of bringing Rome
back to the greatness it deserves.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.280
We're in for three months of promises
and solutions to Rome's problems.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.400
What's certain is the left's had a hold
on the city for 15 years and now...

03:15.960 --> 03:17.440
You okay, Mom?

03:17.520 --> 03:18.720
Yeah.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.520
How dare you set foot in this house?

03:33.800 --> 03:35.800
To remind you what we need

03:36.920 --> 03:38.640
and what you promised us.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.320
Our project for Ostia
is worth two billion euros.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.480
I want the land, time is up.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.280
My respects, ma'am.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.040
And thanks for the coffee.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.720
This is why you can't sleep?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.960
-Come back to bed, it's early.
-I'm going home.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.760
Home?

04:42.040 --> 04:44.080
-Why?
-Because.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.120
Because I feel like it.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.160
Look at yourself, Lele,

04:56.800 --> 04:58.480
you're just a kid.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.280
Sara, what the fuck
are you talking about?

05:01.360 --> 05:04.360
-A minute ago you were in bed in my arms.
-Yes, I know.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.560
Are you dumping me again?

05:08.720 --> 05:09.960
It's better like this.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.880
No, it's better for you. Only for you.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.960
You're so fucking selfish,

05:17.040 --> 05:19.040
staying with whoever serves you best.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.600
Exactly,
that's why I'm going back to Sandro.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.720
Only with him can I achieve what I want.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.680
Do you know why you're here?
You haven't got anywhere to go.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.760
You're not better than me,
you're just like me.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.640
Tell me something,

05:38.160 --> 05:41.800
did you believe in you and me
at least for a moment?

05:43.640 --> 05:44.920
For a moment.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.000
Get out.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.080
What are you doing here?

06:02.600 --> 06:05.840
I told you to solve the problem with
your brother, you haven't done it.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.880
You think I don't know
you schemed with Quirino?

06:09.440 --> 06:12.120
You sent the gypsies to Aureliano's gym.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.560
Listen to me now,
'cause I won't say it twice:

06:15.120 --> 06:17.760
your land has to be mine by tonight,

06:17.840 --> 06:20.480
either you bring it to me
or I take it by force.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.120
And this time, I'll get my hands dirty.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.600
Wake up!

06:51.680 --> 06:54.320
-Stay here, don't move.
-What's going on?

06:54.760 --> 06:56.080
Do what I said.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.960
-You come to finish the job?
-Easy, your sister wants to see you.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.360
She just wants to talk,

07:17.800 --> 07:21.840
she's got nothing to do with
what happened, it was all Quirino.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.760
We'll see.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.800
Hi.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.560
What are you doing here?

07:38.920 --> 07:42.080
I need you to help me understand
what happened to your father.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.720
I want to find his killer.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.400
I've already told your colleagues
everything I know.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.200
But you didn't say that you'd been
to see Franco that afternoon

07:52.800 --> 07:54.600
or what you talked about.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.960
I must have forgotten to mention it.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.240
I don't know, I'm all confused.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.520
-I need to be on my own for a bit.
-But it's important we talk.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.800
Yes, just give me a couple of days.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.080
Bye.

08:40.159 --> 08:41.480
How are you?

08:43.120 --> 08:44.800
Where's the rat?

08:47.240 --> 08:48.840
He's gone for good.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.600
See? You did something right in the end.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.960
What do you want?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.960
Mom's kiosk.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.200
Didn't you want to make it into
something nice, something yours?

09:08.800 --> 09:11.440
Now we can do it, we'll do it together.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.360
Me and you?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.120
What about Samurai?

09:19.360 --> 09:22.080
Samurai's already got the Vatican land.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.800
-But he needs ours.
-The fuck you sayin'?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.280
I told you, he got them,

09:29.760 --> 09:32.040
you really thought
you could fuck him over?

09:33.160 --> 09:35.040
Now he wants what Dad promised him,

09:35.480 --> 09:39.040
but this is our home,
Samurai isn't in charge, we are.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.200
We need to remind him.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.560
You wanna get rid of him?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.160
Come home,

09:48.600 --> 09:51.240
me and you together,
not even the devil can stop us.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.520
There's a price, though, isn't there?

09:58.960 --> 10:01.600
There's only room
for you and me in this family.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.520
You gotta get rid of the black bitch,
for good.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.840
Me and you, Aureliano.
Just me and you.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.360
Think about it.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.240
Taccon's gotta sign off
on the project today,

10:33.320 --> 10:36.200
because the mayor's going tomorrow
and then it's game over

10:36.280 --> 10:39.040
and we'll have done all this for nothing.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.560
-Did you do what I asked?
-First his signature, then the rest.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.120
After he's signed,
you won't need me anymore.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.160
-Why should I trust you?
-Because you have no choice.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.800
What the fuck's that?

11:43.760 --> 11:45.440
Go! Outta my way!

11:46.360 --> 11:47.680
Fuckin’ gypsies!

11:49.840 --> 11:52.600
They stole my wallet! Thieves! Grab them!

11:52.680 --> 11:55.400
Gotta a problem, huh?

11:55.960 --> 11:59.400
It’s easy to take it out
on two little kids. Take it out on me!

12:01.440 --> 12:03.800
What? Never seen
a pissed-off gypsy before?

12:06.560 --> 12:07.800
Go home!

12:19.600 --> 12:20.880
It's over,

12:22.080 --> 12:23.400
I've left him.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.240
I want to be with you.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.320
-Sir...
-Hello.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.920
It's all right, you can go.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.800
Samurai got the Vatican land...

12:41.080 --> 12:42.800
What the fuck did you do, Monaschi?

12:42.880 --> 12:45.640
I had to give it all to him.
I didn't have a choice.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.240
You betrayed us with Samurai.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.480
What the fuck's in your head?

12:51.880 --> 12:52.960
I was set up.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.880
The fuck do I care?

12:55.960 --> 12:57.280
He blackmailed me.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.880
You shoulda called me,
I would have fixed it.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.720
-But now...
-Stop it, leave her alone!

13:03.800 --> 13:04.920
Leave her alone!

13:05.000 --> 13:07.680
-Who's he?
-Calm down. He's my husband.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.520
This jerk? I see why you cheated on him.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.160
-Call the police.
-Who the fuck you wanna call?

13:13.760 --> 13:14.840
Who are you calling?

13:15.280 --> 13:16.200
Let go of him.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.800
What are you gonna say?
You're bigger crooks than me...

13:18.880 --> 13:20.200
Let go of him.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.840
Watch out, Monaschi.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.600
-I'm sorry.
-Enough.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.280
I want a divorce.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.400
Hi, Mom.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.480
[in Sinti] [Your brother is under arrest
in a hospital bed.]

14:07.560 --> 14:10.680
[Aldo is dead and you're here,
like nothing happened.]

14:10.760 --> 14:11.880
[That's enough.]

14:13.480 --> 14:15.040
[Now leave us alone.]

14:17.480 --> 14:18.800
[We'll talk later.]

14:35.000 --> 14:36.160
How's my brother?

14:36.240 --> 14:37.680
We don't know yet.

14:37.760 --> 14:41.720
-And why did you come back?
-This is my house and you're my wife.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.120
What does that mean?

14:44.200 --> 14:46.600
You wanna be
the princess of this family...

14:47.560 --> 14:48.840
Let's do what we gotta do.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.160
Let me do it, Alberto.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.160
Close your eyes.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.080
Close them.

16:02.640 --> 16:03.840
You gotta go.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.040
What are you talking about?

16:07.840 --> 16:10.480
Get your stuff together,
Romolo will drive you home.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.280
Why?

16:12.360 --> 16:14.400
I'm going home
and there's no room for you.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.400
Your sister?
Did she tell you to do this?

16:24.480 --> 16:26.240
No one tells me what to do.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.040
Livia was right,
I'm just a hooker to you,

16:32.120 --> 16:34.160
someone you can buy and sell.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.240
Now you've sold me out to her!

16:36.320 --> 16:37.320
Nice!

16:46.760 --> 16:49.040
With this resolution, no.201,

16:49.120 --> 16:52.640
the Commission approves
the unification of lot 405

16:52.720 --> 16:54.920
with lot 411.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.480
The contract is awarded
to the company Specchio Azzurro.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.840
Mr. Taccon, we just need you
to sign the document.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.160
Mr. Taccon?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.359
Excuse me.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.640
What's the problem?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.920
Who's behind this company?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.680
Taccon, please!

17:52.040 --> 17:54.960
No one will ever investigate this,
I guarantee it.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.800
Think of yourself, of your future,
far from here, sign that document.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.360
Who will the land go to?

18:03.760 --> 18:06.920
To some developers,
neither better nor worse than any other.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.640
But look at the result,
Ostia will have a port.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.360
Work, development, the city's energized.

18:14.680 --> 18:18.600
Save your lies for your re-election
campaign, you'll need them.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.200
You're in it now.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.440
Do you think you're smart enough
to back out?

18:30.160 --> 18:32.080
You don't seem smart to me,

18:33.400 --> 18:34.720
at all.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.080
Finucci was smart.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.360
Look what happened to him.

18:49.760 --> 18:52.160
Sign that document, trust me.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.040
How do you sleep at night?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.280
Like a baby.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.000
We better go.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.400
Good.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.320
Well?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.280
Took care of it.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.960
How are you?

20:16.720 --> 20:18.560
When are you seeing Samurai?

20:21.160 --> 20:23.200
Tonight, I'll tell Romolo to set it up.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.880
No, I'll do it.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.000
-You shouldn't go.
-I'll do what the fuck I want.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.080
All right.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.840
I'm glad you're here.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.200
It's the second time
you've come to my house.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.960
What do you want?

21:06.240 --> 21:08.280
No, I quit.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.440
Stefano and I have decided,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.360
we're kicking you out of the Party.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.760
You won't be on the party ticket
for the upcoming election.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.280
I imagined as much.

21:18.760 --> 21:22.360
-You're not interested?
-No, I've got other plans.

21:23.160 --> 21:24.400
Like what?

21:28.840 --> 21:30.720
You said what you had to say,

21:32.440 --> 21:34.160
so why are you still here?

21:39.800 --> 21:41.640
I know why you're still here,

21:43.440 --> 21:45.000
because I've changed

21:46.360 --> 21:47.920
and now you want me.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.240
You should quit too, they're bad for you.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.920
-Are we ready, Romolo?
-All set.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.680
I'm coming too.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.280
No, I need you to go home.

22:26.520 --> 22:30.320
Call that piece of shit and tell him
you're coming with the signed papers.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.360
Let's go.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.400
Moreno, go with Livia.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.240
Okay.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.000
That was Livia.

23:04.360 --> 23:05.880
All set.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.080
What's wrong?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.000
I did what you said.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.680
And are you happy?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.600
I think so.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.040
Good.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.320
I am too.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.280
I thought you were coming alone.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.520
I like company.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.000
What do you want?

24:18.440 --> 24:20.120
I'm in charge of Ostia now.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.880
If you want to make deals,
make 'em with me, or stay out.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.040
The kid's become a man.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.680
And you've grown old, look at you.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.160
Maybe it's time for you to fuck off.

24:34.960 --> 24:35.880
You think so?

24:46.200 --> 24:49.920
Did you think I was so fucking dumb
that I wouldn't know what you'd do?

24:51.760 --> 24:54.160
I'm not afraid of dying, are you?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.480
You want to take Livia's place
and get in on the deal?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.880
Okay I'll keep you in.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.320
You'll be in on my share,
I didn't even give your father that much.

25:05.840 --> 25:09.360
But times have changed,
you need to make room for young people.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.720
Say hi to your sister.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.680
Gianluca?

25:52.600 --> 25:54.640
Gianluca, all good?

25:58.680 --> 26:00.360
Oh, it's you.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.960
-Where's Gianluca?
-Outside.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.560
Go out too, I gotta talk to Livia.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.240
Come on.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.240
Your brother wants to see you.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.840
Go away.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.960
Take this money and go.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.120
What are you saying, Aureliano?

27:26.880 --> 27:27.760
Don't touch me.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.920
I don't want you to touch me.

27:36.440 --> 27:39.040
Ever since you were born,
I remember Dad saying,

27:39.520 --> 27:41.360
"Mom's gone."

27:43.080 --> 27:45.640
And he put you in your room

27:47.600 --> 27:49.040
and you cried.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.400
You cried...

27:54.920 --> 27:57.000
I can still remember that crying.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.400
So I got a pillow,

28:03.280 --> 28:05.960
because I didn't want to hear
that crying anymore.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.160
And then I saw you,

28:12.560 --> 28:14.240
you were this tiny little thing.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.360
So, I picked you up

28:18.960 --> 28:20.720
and you stopped crying.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.720
Mom was gone, but you were there,

28:29.080 --> 28:30.480
my brother.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
You can't do this to me, Aureliano.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.560
-Look at me.
-Take this money and go.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.840
All because of that black bitch?

28:46.120 --> 28:47.280
Go away.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.160
Everything my brother did, he did for us,

29:55.200 --> 29:56.400
for this family,

29:56.920 --> 29:59.600
so everyone in Rome would respect us

30:00.280 --> 30:03.160
and no one would treat us
like gypsy scum anymore.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.000
Only now he's under arrest
at the hospital and Aldo is dead.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.800
[Now I'm the head of this family.]

30:14.400 --> 30:17.160
[No one's gonna disrespect us anymore.]

30:19.000 --> 30:21.320
[What do we do about the Adamis?]

30:25.120 --> 30:27.000
[I've got something in mind.]

30:45.320 --> 30:47.080
You like seeing it from up high?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.440
I like seeing it from here.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.680
Never forget where you come from,

30:58.800 --> 31:01.560
especially when you still don't know
where you're going.

31:02.200 --> 31:05.760
-I know exactly where I'm going.
-Where's that?

31:08.040 --> 31:10.320
I'll never be the mayor of this city,

31:11.240 --> 31:13.360
I'll never be an important politician,

31:14.040 --> 31:15.920
one of those who go on TV.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.200
My destiny is to stay behind the scenes,

31:19.280 --> 31:20.600
just like you.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.200
I rule Rome.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.960
Rome can't be ruled,
at most it can be administrated.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.480
You're from the world in between,

31:35.760 --> 31:39.520
a place where different interests meet,
legal and illegal.

31:42.760 --> 31:46.400
In reality, you're the administrator
of Rome, not its ruler.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.760
And who would you be?

31:49.160 --> 31:50.400
Your partner.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.400
Don't relax too much then,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.280
we only have three months
to get the mayor we want elected.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.000
Hi.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.000
Let's sit down.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.560
-Sara.
-Your Eminence.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.360
-How is Sandro?
-Fine.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.440
-He sends his regards.
-Come in.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.760
Help the poor?

32:38.960 --> 32:41.440
But your work on the Commission
isn't done.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.800
Yes, I know, but after the tragedy
with Monsignor Theodosiou

32:44.880 --> 32:47.720
I realized I wanted to do more,

32:47.800 --> 32:50.120
that I need to do more

32:50.320 --> 32:52.440
and I'd like to offer myself

32:52.520 --> 32:55.960
to those really in need, the destitute.

32:56.760 --> 32:57.880
The destitute?

32:58.200 --> 32:59.280
Yes.

32:59.360 --> 33:03.360
Our cities are filling up
with people in search of hope,

33:04.840 --> 33:08.360
migrants who have left everything
to come here.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.320
And I think I can help them.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.840
Sandro asked you for a divorce.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.640
Did you think I didn't know?

33:20.320 --> 33:22.400
Like you thought I didn't know anything

33:22.480 --> 33:25.080
about your dirty dealings
with Monsignor Theodosiou?

33:26.360 --> 33:28.440
Migrants are the business of the future,

33:28.520 --> 33:31.160
they say they're more profitable
than drugs

33:31.960 --> 33:33.600
and you know this.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.800
But the Church can't be complicit in,

33:37.880 --> 33:39.760
the Church must help the poor.

33:40.760 --> 33:44.000
You made a mistake, Sara,
this time it's gone badly for you.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.000
But I have to admit
that you have a certain talent

33:50.120 --> 33:53.720
and perhaps you've found
the right person to collaborate with.

34:13.520 --> 34:17.480
It had to seem real,
I couldn't tell you the truth.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.960
I had to lie to you
to protect you from Livia.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.480
So, what do you want now?

34:34.120 --> 34:36.239
I want you with me, that's what I want.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.360
-Good morning.
-I came by to thank you.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.160
-Thank me?
-Yes, I learned a lot from you.

35:10.040 --> 35:13.200
Not to give in to emotion
and to watch my back,

35:13.280 --> 35:17.200
but especially how to hold a grudge
against those who've crossed me.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.440
Lessons I won't forget.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.400
Take care.

35:26.280 --> 35:29.560
Another thing I learned from you,
to love the poor.

36:01.480 --> 36:05.600
Councilmen, a moment's silence, please.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.480
The mayor is arriving.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.960
Cinaglia?

36:35.760 --> 36:38.280
-Is the rumor true?
-Which of the many?

36:38.800 --> 36:42.120
That you won't be on the ticket,
that the party doesn't want you anymore.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.800
The mayor resigned
and we're heading to an election

36:45.880 --> 36:49.120
and you'll no longer be a city councilman,
what will you do?

36:49.200 --> 36:52.760
I'll be here, in my office, as always.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.560
How?

36:55.240 --> 36:59.000
-I'll run on my own.
-For mayor?

36:59.400 --> 37:01.760
Cinaglia, you've got no chance.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.520
Mayor? No.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.160
I'm running for something much better.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.440
There's something I gotta do.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.840
See you later, okay?

37:45.160 --> 37:46.280
You're going?

37:47.360 --> 37:48.440
I gotta see someone.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.160
Stop, Alberto.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.440
[Wait outside.]

38:12.480 --> 38:14.520
You're acting like a boss,

38:15.000 --> 38:16.920
but bosses can't be traitors.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.760
[What do you mean?]

38:20.080 --> 38:22.960
I know about you and the Adami kid.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.520
Know this,

38:26.240 --> 38:29.280
as of today
I'm not protecting you anymore.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.160
You're just like anyone else,

38:32.240 --> 38:34.840
if you make a wrong move, you'll pay.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.960
Remember that.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.200
Want to get something to eat?

38:58.600 --> 39:02.360
Not now, I've got to do something
I can't put off.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.680
Mara?

39:13.520 --> 39:16.360
I need to talk to you, it's important.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.560
Okay, but not now, I'm going on duty.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.920
Maybe tonight.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.800
Let me know.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.840
Yes, see you later.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.800
See you.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.680
To make them happy, I should kill you,

40:29.280 --> 40:31.000
to show them who I am.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.080
But I don't need to kill you
to know who I am.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.240
I don't need to prove anything
to anyone, not even you.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.800
And who are you, Spadino?

40:44.200 --> 40:45.880
A scumbag gypsy.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.840
A gypsy and a faggot.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.520
But now I'm in charge at home.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.280
Things have changed.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.080
In the end, we're both in charge, see?

41:09.520 --> 41:12.200
I'm doing the deal with Samurai,
on my own though.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.440
There's no room for you.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.720
Neither you nor Samurai decide that.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.400
Keep it in mind,

41:22.920 --> 41:25.000
maybe one day
you'll see things differently

41:25.080 --> 41:27.200
and remember who your real friends are.

41:28.640 --> 41:31.160
If not, next time I'll have to kill you.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.280
Next time, Spadino.

42:11.040 --> 42:13.280
I went to Dad and I told him everything,

42:14.080 --> 42:17.680
where the hook-up was,
what the guys looked like.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.040
And you don't know anything else?

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
No.

42:24.880 --> 42:27.960
I imagine it wasn't easy
to come and tell me this.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.200
There's something else.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.440
I'm listening.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.320
Dad was right.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.640
What do you mean?

42:43.600 --> 42:45.320
I want to join the force.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.720
Gabriele, your father's gone.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.600
I'm not doing it for him,

42:53.960 --> 42:54.960
I'm doing it for me.

42:57.880 --> 42:59.480
But I need you to help me.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.280
Okay.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.600
Thank you.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.920
You can't stay here, you know that.

43:22.360 --> 43:25.400
I'll just get my stuff,
then I'm leaving for good.

44:22.440 --> 44:23.960
Romolo, come on.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.840
Where the fuck's that black bitch?

44:34.480 --> 44:37.400
-Don't do anything dumb, Livia.
-Over there, move!

44:40.320 --> 44:42.480
I'll find her myself, don't worry.

44:43.800 --> 44:44.800
Livia!

45:58.760 --> 46:00.720
Not this dickhead again.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.280
Get in.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.240
Get in.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.440
Aureliano.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.160
Nude as Rome
Great as beauty

47:35.240 --> 47:37.680
A caring mother who hits you
And caresses you

47:37.760 --> 47:40.360
A tired worker
A big shot or a bandit

47:40.440 --> 47:43.080
Tonight you'd like to be
Her favorite son

47:43.160 --> 47:46.240
But you're like all the others
Tired face at the bus stop

47:46.320 --> 47:49.520
Eyes down, hands in pockets
Thinking of your day

47:49.600 --> 47:51.960
Everything you have
You had to sweat for it

47:52.040 --> 47:54.720
Zero privileges, Mafia Rome style

47:54.800 --> 47:57.520
Those around you
Have put a price on life

47:57.600 --> 48:00.360
The daily reward
For eating yourself up bit by bit

48:00.840 --> 48:02.520
Then you raise your eyes and see Rome

48:02.600 --> 48:05.720
And those who really live this city
Find meaning for it all

48:05.800 --> 48:07.640
And don't want to leave anymore...

48:08.120 --> 48:09.960
Don't want to leave anymore...

48:13.960 --> 48:15.600
Don't want to leave anymore.

48:33.200 --> 48:35.040
