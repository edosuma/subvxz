WEBVTT

00:06.337 --> 00:08.639
SO, A NEW FAMILY BOUGHT
THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.

00:08.639 --> 00:10.311
I MARKED THAT PROPERTY
SO MANY TIMES,

00:10.311 --> 00:11.682
IT SHOULD BE MINE.

00:11.682 --> 00:16.117
APPARENTLY MY URINE'S
NOT LEGALLY BINDING.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.350
STILL, I WAS VERY EXCITED
TO MEET OUR NEW NEIGHBORS.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.653
WHOO-HOO! SOMEONE'S HERE!
SOMEONE'S COMING!

00:22.653 --> 00:26.057
OH, THEY'RE ON THE PATH!
THEY'RE APPROACHING THE DOOR!

00:26.057 --> 00:27.228
( doorbell rings )

00:27.228 --> 00:29.560
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU DOGS
AND GETTING SO WORKED UP

00:29.560 --> 00:31.402
EVERY TIME SOMEONE
COMES TO THE DOOR?

00:31.402 --> 00:35.406
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO EXCITING
I DON'T NEED A LITTLE VARIETY?

00:36.607 --> 00:38.169
HELLO.

00:38.169 --> 00:40.341
ARE YOU A CONFUSED GIRL
WHO'S HERE TO SEE MY FATHER,

00:40.341 --> 00:43.344
OR A CONFUSED GIRL
WHO'S HERE TO SEE MY BROTHER?

00:43.344 --> 00:44.475
EXCUSE ME?

00:44.475 --> 00:45.476
I'M SORRY.

00:45.476 --> 00:46.777
MY FATHER
IS A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST,

00:46.777 --> 00:49.580
AND MY BROTHER
JUST LIKES CONFUSED GIRLS.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.582
I'M NIKKI ORTIZ.

00:51.582 --> 00:52.583
AVERY JENNINGS.

00:52.583 --> 00:54.085
I JUST MOVED HERE
FROM EL SALVADOR,

00:54.085 --> 00:57.088
AND I'M GOING DOOR TO DOOR
INTRODUCING MYSELF
TO MY NEIGHBORS.

00:57.088 --> 00:58.589
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET...

00:58.589 --> 01:00.591
AND DANGEROUS.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.295
NIKKI ORTIZ--
SMART, BEAUTIFUL...

01:04.295 --> 01:06.767
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
SHE COULD BE MORE PERFECT.

01:14.705 --> 01:16.577
COME ON IN.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.749
I LOVE YOUR COUNTRY.

01:18.749 --> 01:21.612
PEOPLE OFFER ME FOOD
AND TRIPS TO THE BEACH,

01:21.612 --> 01:23.754
AND WHEREVER I GO,
YOUNG MEN KEEP GIVING ME

01:23.754 --> 01:26.757
THEIR PHONE NUMBERS
AND EMAIL ADDRESSES.

01:26.757 --> 01:30.121
YES, AMERICANS ARE VERY OPEN
WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION.

01:30.121 --> 01:32.423
AHH, SHE SMELLS SO GOOD,

01:32.423 --> 01:35.626
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S NOT BACON.

01:35.626 --> 01:37.628
I'M SORRY,
THIS IS JUST STAN'S WAY

01:37.628 --> 01:38.829
OF WELCOMING YOU
TO OUR HOUSE.

01:38.829 --> 01:40.831
( laughs )
HE'S SO CUTE!

01:40.831 --> 01:42.533
THANKS.
WE JUST GOT HIM GROOMED.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.205
I HAVE A DOG MYSELF.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.678
I EVEN KNOW A SPECIAL SPOT
TO SCRATCH BEHIND THE EARS.

01:47.678 --> 01:49.680
RIGHT, THE MYTHICAL
DOGGY SWEET SPOT.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.342
LIKE THAT EVEN EXISTS.

01:51.342 --> 01:53.814
HOT KIBBLE WITH GRAVY,
IT DOES EXIST!

01:53.814 --> 01:58.649
OH, YEAH!
YEAH, SCRATCH MY BRAINS OUT!

01:58.649 --> 02:01.492
♪♪

02:17.868 --> 02:19.570
YOU DID GREAT TODAY, ROB.

02:19.570 --> 02:20.871
THANKS, DR. JAMES.

02:20.871 --> 02:22.743
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

02:25.176 --> 02:27.518
I KNOW THAT BOY'S
BEEN HERE A LOT.
HOW'S TO GOING?

02:27.518 --> 02:30.521
WELL, WITHOUT BETRAYING
THE DOCTOR-PATIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY

02:30.521 --> 02:32.853
BY TELLING YOU HIS PROBLEM--
STEALING--

02:32.853 --> 02:35.826
I WOULD SAY WE ARE
MAKING GOOD PROGRESS.

02:35.826 --> 02:38.889
OH, WELL, GREAT.
CARE FOR A LITTLE
CELEBRATORY COFFEE CAKE?

02:38.889 --> 02:41.462
OH, I THINK I HAVE TIME
TO REWARD MYSELF WITH--

02:41.462 --> 02:43.794
HE STOLE MY WATCH!

02:43.794 --> 02:45.936
I DON'T DESERVE COFFEE CAKE.

02:45.936 --> 02:47.838
DADDY! DADDY, DADDY!

02:47.838 --> 02:50.801
CAN YOU TALK TO MY CLASS
ABOUT YOUR JOB ON CAREER DAY?

02:50.801 --> 02:54.345
OH, YOU MUST BE PROUD
OF YOUR DADDY'S JOB,
HUH, SWEETIE?

02:54.345 --> 02:56.677
YEAH, GIVE ME THAT CAKE.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.580
DADDY, WHAT KIND OF SOCKS
ARE YOU GOING TO BRING
TO MY CLASS?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.682
SOCKS? WHY WOULD I BRING SOCKS?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.484
'CAUSE YOU'RE
A "SOCK-OLOGIST."

03:03.484 --> 03:06.186
TAKE THE CAKE.

03:06.186 --> 03:10.190
SWEETIE, I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST,
NOT A "SOCK-OLOGIST."

03:10.190 --> 03:11.822
I SOLVE PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS.

03:11.822 --> 03:13.224
WHY?

03:14.265 --> 03:16.497
DADDY HELPS PEOPLE, HONEY.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.198
YEAH, I'M A...

03:18.198 --> 03:19.930
WELL, I'M LIKE A SUPERHERO.

03:19.930 --> 03:23.404
YAY! DADDY'S A SUPERHERO!

03:23.404 --> 03:25.676
CAKE.

03:25.676 --> 03:27.508
DADDY, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY TEDDY BEAR?

03:27.508 --> 03:29.380
I HAD IT BEFORE
THAT BOY LEFT.

03:33.484 --> 03:35.946
SUCH A LOVELY TOUR, AVERY.
THANK YOU.

03:35.946 --> 03:38.819
OH, NO PROBLEM.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE PASADENA,

03:38.819 --> 03:41.652
ESPECIALLY NEW YEAR'S DAY
AND THE ROSE PARADE.

03:41.652 --> 03:42.953
IF YOU CAMP OUT
THE NIGHT BEFORE,

03:42.953 --> 03:44.755
YOU CAN GET
REALLY GOOD SEATS.

03:44.755 --> 03:47.258
OH, THAT SOUNDS SO NICE
TO HAVE SEATS.

03:47.258 --> 03:51.432
I HAVE TO STAND
AND WAVE FROM A FLOAT.

03:51.432 --> 03:55.235
THEY ASKED ME
TO BE ROSE QUEEN.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.237
WOW. ( chuckles )
THAT'S AMAZING.

03:57.237 --> 04:02.242
YOU KNOW, ONE YEAR, I ACTUALLY
GOT TO GLUE GARDENIAS ONTO
THE SIERRA MADRE BURRO

04:02.242 --> 04:07.017
AND HAVE MY PICTURE TAKEN
WITH PASADENA COMPTROLLER
MADGE GIMMELSTOP.

04:07.017 --> 04:08.248
( barks )

04:08.248 --> 04:10.250
EVITA, BE POLITE.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.252
NO, IT'S OKAY.
SHE'S SO CUTE.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR OUR DOG'S TO MEET.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.856
HEY, STAN, COME HERE.

04:15.856 --> 04:20.331
A FRIEND!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! A FRIEND!

04:20.331 --> 04:23.263
( barks )

04:23.263 --> 04:25.336
IS THERE A MUTE BUTTON
ON THIS THING?

04:25.336 --> 04:28.268
STAN, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET EVITA.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.871
EVITA, I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO MEET A TRUCK.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.345
( laughs ) THEY'RE GOING
TO BE THE BEST OF FRIENDS, NO?

04:34.345 --> 04:35.546
NO.

04:35.546 --> 04:37.548
( barks )

04:37.548 --> 04:39.310
HEY, STAN. HEY, AVERY.

04:39.310 --> 04:43.283
HI, I'M TYLER.
HERE'S MY PHONE NUMBER
AND EMAIL ADDRESS.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.286
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M NIKKI ORTIZ.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.958
I JUST MOVED HERE
FROM EL SALVADOR.

04:47.958 --> 04:50.961
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS WHY
YOU'RE SO "EL SALV-ADORABLE."

04:50.961 --> 04:55.295
( chuckles ) HERE,
I'LL JUST TAKE THAT FOR YOU.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.427
( growls )
GET AWAY FROM ME.

04:56.427 --> 04:58.329
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
MY EMAIL ADDRESS!

04:58.329 --> 05:02.573
UH, NIKKI, MAYBE WE COULD WALK
OUR DOGS IN THE PARK SOMETIME?

05:02.573 --> 05:03.574
OKAY.

05:03.574 --> 05:05.075
NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

05:05.075 --> 05:06.637
YOU'RE THE ROSE QUEEN.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.939
JUST SAY GOOD-BYE
AND USE THE PARADE-FLOAT WAVE.

05:08.939 --> 05:10.941
SCREW IN THE LIGHT BULB,
SCREW IN THE LIGHT BULB.

05:10.941 --> 05:12.643
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

05:12.643 --> 05:15.546
SCREW IN THE LIGHT BULB.

05:15.546 --> 05:17.348
I'LL GET READY
AND MEET YOU IN AN HOUR.

05:17.348 --> 05:20.351
OKAY, BUT IF "GET READY"
MEANS MORE BODY SPRAY,

05:20.351 --> 05:22.993
YOU ARE ALREADY VERY READY.

05:22.993 --> 05:24.825
COME, EVITA.

05:24.825 --> 05:29.360
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU THINK
YOU HAVE A SHOT WITH NIKKI.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.103
( laughs ) YOU'RE IN
WAY OVER YOUR HAIR IN THIS ONE.

05:33.103 --> 05:37.638
PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE NOT
GONNA TAKE ME TO THE PARK
WITH THAT YAPPING POMERANIAN.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.069
YAP, YAP, YAP, YAP, YAP, YAP!

05:39.069 --> 05:42.042
LOOK, STAN, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO BE MY WINGMAN HERE.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.914
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A WINGMAN IS?

05:43.914 --> 05:47.017
IF YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT CHICKEN,
I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.

05:47.017 --> 05:49.550
A WINGMAN IS A GUY
WHO HELPS YOU GET THE GIRL

05:49.550 --> 05:52.122
BY SPENDING TIME
WITH HER ANNOYING FRIEND.

05:52.122 --> 05:55.025
HE MAKES
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE
FOR HIS BUDDY.

05:55.025 --> 05:58.959
WOW, THAT SOUNDS CRAZY NOBLE.
I'M IN!

05:58.959 --> 06:02.633
ALL RIGHT! YES! YEAH!

06:02.633 --> 06:04.094
WELL, THAT'S ODD.

06:10.541 --> 06:12.543
LOOK, I DON'T MIND
TAKING ONE FOR YOU HERE,

06:12.543 --> 06:14.004
BUT IF EVITA
BECOMES UNBEARABLE,

06:14.004 --> 06:15.876
WE NEED A SIGNAL
TO END THIS.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.708
I'LL JUST START
BARKING LIKE CRAZY.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.980
( barks )

06:19.980 --> 06:22.052
OKAY, OKAY, I GET IT.

06:22.052 --> 06:24.815
BUT COME ON, STAN.
EVITA'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD.

06:24.815 --> 06:26.887
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE HER A CHANCE.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.889
( barks )

06:28.889 --> 06:30.521
( barks )

06:30.521 --> 06:33.724
WOW, STAN, YOU'RE REALLY
EXCITED TO SEE HER.

06:33.724 --> 06:35.996
NO, THAT WAS THE SIGNAL!

06:35.996 --> 06:37.998
HEY, NIKKI.
YOU SMELL GREAT.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.430
WHAT'S THAT PERFUME
YOU'RE WEARING?

06:39.430 --> 06:40.831
MY SKIN.

06:40.831 --> 06:42.833
IT'S LIKE YOU TOOK
A BATH IN "AWESOME"

06:42.833 --> 06:45.536
AND POWDERED YOURSELF
WITH "WOW."

06:45.536 --> 06:49.039
( laughs )
YOU ARE SO FUNNY!

06:49.039 --> 06:50.981
YOU MAKE ME JIGGLE!

06:50.981 --> 06:52.543
YOU MEAN "GIGGLE."

06:52.543 --> 06:54.715
NO, I MEAN "JIGGLE."
IT'S HOW I LAUGH.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.917
( both laugh )

06:56.917 --> 06:58.989
( barks )

06:58.989 --> 07:02.793
WOULD I BE A BAD WINGMAN
IF I ATE HER?

07:05.556 --> 07:09.059
SO, REMEMBER HOW EXCITED
CHLOE GOT WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WERE LIKE A SUPERHERO?

07:09.059 --> 07:11.932
WELL, SHE TOLD HER WHOLE CLASS
THAT YOU ARE A SUPERHERO

07:11.932 --> 07:13.934
AND THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
COMING IN TO TALK ABOUT.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.206
( chuckles )
OH, THAT'S FUNNY. REALLY?

07:16.206 --> 07:17.207
YEAH.

07:17.207 --> 07:20.070
CHLOE, CAN YOU COME IN HERE?

07:20.070 --> 07:22.072
HER TEACHER
THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY, TOO.

07:22.072 --> 07:24.915
IN FACT, SHE COULDN'T
STOP LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT
OF YOU AS A SUPERHERO.

07:24.915 --> 07:28.218
APPARENTLY SHE SAW YOU RUN
THAT TIME AT THE SCHOOL PICNIC.

07:28.218 --> 07:32.653
HEY, WHEN THE BEES
ARE COMING AT YOUR FACE,
YOU DO THIS.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.755
( screams ) BEES!

07:34.755 --> 07:37.227
CHLOE, COME BACK!
THERE ARE NO BEES!

07:37.227 --> 07:39.590
COME HERE.

07:39.590 --> 07:42.963
SWEETIE, I'M NOT A SUPERHERO.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.135
WHAT I DO DO IS HELP CHILDREN--

07:45.135 --> 07:48.098
CHILDREN WITH FEELINGS
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
OR PROBLEMS THEY CAN'T SOLVE--

07:48.098 --> 07:49.970
AND I MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.574
YOU SAID "DOO-DOO."
( laughs )

07:56.577 --> 07:58.208
THIS WAS SO MUCH FUN!

07:58.208 --> 08:00.781
I'M GLAD WE WALKED
OUR DOGS TOGETHER.

08:00.781 --> 08:04.054
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU USE YOUR DOG LIKE THIS
TO CHARM ALL THE SEÑORITAS.

08:04.054 --> 08:06.917
NO WAY, YOU'RE SPECIAL.
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

08:06.917 --> 08:10.190
NOT WITH SEÑORITAS,
"JUNIOR-ITAS,"
OR "SOPHOMORE-ITAS."

08:10.190 --> 08:11.722
( laughs )

08:11.722 --> 08:14.064
I THINK THE DOGS
HAD A GOOD TIME.

08:14.064 --> 08:16.496
BUT WHY IS STAN
DIGGING A HOLE OVER THERE?

08:18.699 --> 08:21.131
IT LOOKS ABOUT
THE SIZE OF EVITA.

08:21.131 --> 08:24.504
WHAT? DOGS DIG HOLES.
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL.

08:25.936 --> 08:28.839
SO, I'D LIKE
TO DO THIS AGAIN SOMETIME.

08:28.839 --> 08:31.912
ME, TOO.
I'LL TEXT YOU LATER.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.014
COME ON, EVITA.

08:37.888 --> 08:38.989
( barks )

08:38.989 --> 08:42.152
SO CLOSE!

08:42.152 --> 08:45.125
THANKS, WINGMAN.
YOU REALLY CAME THROUGH FOR ME.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.658
JUST GET ME OUT OF THIS PARK
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

08:47.658 --> 08:52.162
IF I NEVER COME BACK HERE,
IT'LL BE TOO-- OH, MY DOG!

08:52.162 --> 08:56.166
SHE PUTS
THE "OODLE" IN "POODLE."

08:56.166 --> 08:58.569
TYLER, YOU GOTTA TAKE ME
OVER THERE. SHE'S MAGNIFICENT!

08:58.569 --> 09:01.071
LOOK HOW MUCH ANKLE
SHE'S SHOWING.

09:01.071 --> 09:04.915
OH, NO WAY! THE GIRL
WITH THAT POODLE IS CHRISTIE.

09:04.915 --> 09:06.116
WE CAN'T GO OVER THERE.

09:06.116 --> 09:07.117
WHY NOT?

09:07.117 --> 09:08.548
HI, TYLER!

09:08.548 --> 09:11.081
TYLER! TYLER!
TYLER, TYLER, TYLER!

09:11.081 --> 09:13.083
THAT'S WHY NOT.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.656
SHE'S THE MOST ANNOYING GIRL
AT SCHOOL!

09:15.656 --> 09:19.790
REALLY? ANNOYING?
WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE?

09:19.790 --> 09:22.332
TYLER! TYLER! TYLER! TYLER!

09:22.332 --> 09:25.135
I THOUGHT THE WINGMAN
WAS SUPPOSED TO SPEND TIME
WITH THE ANNOYING FRIEND.

09:25.135 --> 09:28.098
I TOOK A HIT FOR YOU, MAN.
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

09:28.098 --> 09:31.842
DUDE, THAT'S NOT A HIT,
THAT'S A BUS FALLING ON MY HEAD!

09:31.842 --> 09:34.074
THE WINGMAN CODE.

09:34.074 --> 09:38.048
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE WINGMAN CODE.

09:38.048 --> 09:42.052
HEY, CHRISTIE.
WHAT'S UP?

09:42.052 --> 09:44.184
THIS IS SO FUN
TO SEE YOU WITH OUR DOGS.

09:44.184 --> 09:47.187
THIS IS SO FUN.
THIS IS SO FUN!

09:47.187 --> 09:49.189
( barks )

09:49.189 --> 09:51.191
I DON'T HEAR A SIGNAL.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.592
( barking )

09:52.592 --> 09:54.925
LET'S BE OUR DOGS.
THAT'S FUN!

09:54.925 --> 09:57.668
( barks )

09:57.668 --> 10:01.031
I GOTTA GO NOW, BUT LET'S
TOTALLY HANG SOMETIME.

10:01.031 --> 10:03.103
TUESDAY? TUESDAY, TUESDAY?

10:05.135 --> 10:06.376
( whimpers )

10:06.376 --> 10:09.209
ALL RIGHT, TUESDAY IT IS.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.610
( gasps )

10:10.610 --> 10:12.212
MANDY, COME.

10:12.212 --> 10:16.086
DON'T FORGET! TUESDAY!
TUESDAY, TUESDAY, TUESDAY!

10:17.888 --> 10:20.220
WE'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER HOLE.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.895
CHECK THIS OUT.

10:24.895 --> 10:27.397
IF YOU MISTYPE
"I'M POPPING POPCORN,"

10:27.397 --> 10:31.061
IT'LL AUTO-CORRECT TO SAY
"I'M POOPING POPCORN."

10:31.061 --> 10:34.064
YEAH, NOT SO FUNNY
WHEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO YOU.

10:34.064 --> 10:37.407
I WAS BUTT-SCOOTING FOR DAYS.

10:37.407 --> 10:39.339
( phone chimes )
WHOA!

10:39.339 --> 10:44.144
NIKKI JUST TEXTED AND SHE WANTS
TO WALK HER DOG WITH US AGAIN
ON TUESDAY.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.077
"Y-E-S."

10:47.077 --> 10:51.251
UH, ARE YOU FORGETTING
WE HAVE A PRIOR WITH CHRISTIE
AND MANDY ON TUESDAY?

10:51.251 --> 10:54.254
( imitating Christie )
TUESDAY, TUESDAY, TUESDAY!

10:54.254 --> 10:55.826
YOU GOTTA CANCEL NIKKI.

10:55.826 --> 10:57.758
I CAN'T CANCEL NIKKI!

10:57.758 --> 10:59.259
THE WINGMAN CODE.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.262
OKAY, HONOR IS HONOR.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.234
I'LL JUST LIE TO NIKKI.

11:04.234 --> 11:05.766
YES!

11:05.766 --> 11:07.297
"NIKKI, CAN'T GO TUESDAY.

11:07.297 --> 11:11.171
HAVE TO STUDY TO PASS
SOME HORRIBLE CLASS."

11:11.171 --> 11:13.904
HAPPY NOW?
UH, VERY.

11:13.904 --> 11:17.677
YOU JUST TEXTED NIKKI
THAT YOU "HAVE TO PASS
SOME HORRIBLE GAS."

11:24.254 --> 11:26.917
THIS BENCH WAS NAMED
FOR MY GRANDMOTHER.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.119
SHE FELL OFF A BRIDGE.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.261
DID SHE FALL
OR WAS SHE PUSHED?

11:31.261 --> 11:33.864
( laughs )

11:33.864 --> 11:36.266
TYLER? YOU LIED TO ME.

11:36.266 --> 11:37.828
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

11:37.828 --> 11:39.469
HURRY, HURRY.
I BROUGHT EGG SALAD.

11:39.469 --> 11:42.072
IT'S GOT CORIANDER!

11:44.735 --> 11:47.107
YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T
MEET WITH ME TUESDAY.

11:47.107 --> 11:51.111
YOU ALSO SAID,
"I NEVER USE MY DOG
TO CHARM OTHER GIRLS."

11:51.111 --> 11:55.445
AND TO THINK I WAS SO CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR HORRIBLE GAS!

11:55.445 --> 11:58.448
LOOK, NIKKI,
I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, OKAY?

11:58.448 --> 12:01.451
THIS ALL BECAUSE I PROMISED
MY DOG I WOULD BE HIS WINGMAN

12:01.451 --> 12:03.794
SO HE AND THAT DOG
COULD BE TOGETHER.

12:03.794 --> 12:05.926
I WAS JUST DOING
WHAT MY DOG WANTED.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.358
YOU MUST THINK I'M THICK
IN THE CABEZA!

12:08.358 --> 12:11.401
NO, I THINK YOU HAVE
A FANTASTIC CABEZA!

12:11.401 --> 12:13.203
TYLER, COME LOOK!

12:13.203 --> 12:15.936
I'VE GOT ANTS
STUCK IN MY SUNSCREEN!

12:21.842 --> 12:23.143
AND I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO APOLOGIZE,

12:23.143 --> 12:25.215
BUT NIKKI
WON'T RETURN MY CALLS.

12:25.215 --> 12:27.047
I TRIED TEXTING HER
THAT I'M REALLY SORRY

12:27.047 --> 12:29.850
AND ENDED UP TELLING HER
THAT "I'M REALLY SHIRLEY."

12:29.850 --> 12:32.222
WELL, SHIRLEY,
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE HAIR.

12:32.222 --> 12:35.886
AVERY, I'VE BEEN THINKING
I SHOULD TELL HER STAN CAN TALK

12:35.886 --> 12:38.188
SO HE CAN EXPLAIN WHY
I WAS WITH THAT OTHER GIRL.

12:38.188 --> 12:39.359
WHAT?!

12:39.359 --> 12:41.261
WELL, I DON'T SEE
ANY OTHER CHOICE.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.333
I'VE BEEN TURNING IT OVER
IN MY HEAD ALL DAY.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.835
OH, THAT'S WHAT THAT NOISE WAS.

12:44.835 --> 12:47.467
I THOUGHT
THE WASHING MACHINE WAS BROKEN.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.199
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

12:49.199 --> 12:51.902
SO AM I. YOU CAN'T
TELL HER STAN CAN TALK.

12:51.902 --> 12:54.374
JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT GIRL
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.377
NO, BUT-BUT NIKKI
ISN'T LIKE OTHER GIRLS.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.250
AND I'M NOT JUST
TALKING ABOUT HER CABEZA.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.353
I LIKE WHAT'S UP HERE.

13:03.353 --> 13:05.315
CABEZA MEANS "HEAD."

13:05.315 --> 13:10.220
OH, THEN SOME OF MY OTHER TEXTS
DO NOT MAKE SENSE EITHER.

13:10.220 --> 13:13.193
COME ON, AVERY.
I'VE NEVER FELT THIS WAY
ABOUT ANYONE.

13:13.193 --> 13:17.367
WHAT CAN I DO
TO PROVE IT TO YOU? OKAY,
I'LL DO ANYTHING. JUST NAME IT.

13:17.367 --> 13:18.568
THE WHOLE HEAD?

13:18.568 --> 13:20.400
TOTALLY BALD.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.273
AND IF I DO THIS, YOU'LL LET ME
REVEAL STAN'S SECRET?

13:23.273 --> 13:24.274
THAT'S THE DEAL.

13:24.274 --> 13:26.236
FINE...

13:26.236 --> 13:28.378
IF IT'LL SHOW YOU
HOW MUCH NIKKI MEANS TO ME.

13:28.378 --> 13:30.340
NO, STOP!

13:31.942 --> 13:34.414
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT!
I WAS JUST TESTING YOU!

13:34.414 --> 13:37.347
YOU COULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME THAT
TWO SECONDS AGO?!

13:37.347 --> 13:39.389
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY. ( chuckles )

13:39.389 --> 13:41.391
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD.

13:43.093 --> 13:45.225
LOOK, WE CAN'T
DIVULGE STAN'S SECRET,

13:45.225 --> 13:47.227
BUT I CAN SEE
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO YOU,

13:47.227 --> 13:49.099
SO I'LL TALK TO NIKKI, OKAY?

13:49.099 --> 13:51.101
I PROMISE I'LL MAKE THIS
RIGHT WITH HER.

13:51.101 --> 13:53.103
YOU CAN GET HER
TO FORGIVE ME FOR THE LIE?

13:53.103 --> 13:58.268
I THINK I CAN. OF COURSE,
IT'S REALLY NOT GONNA MATTER
ONCE SHE SEES YOUR HAIR.

13:58.268 --> 13:59.409
( screams )

14:01.311 --> 14:03.843
SHH.
( whimpers )

14:03.843 --> 14:05.245
THERE, THERE.

14:09.319 --> 14:11.421
DADDY, IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO GO HOME.

14:11.421 --> 14:17.427
THE JANITOR TOLD ME
HE COULD PRETEND TO BE MY DADDY
AFTER HE CLEANS THE TOILETS.

14:17.427 --> 14:19.990
HONEY,
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PROUD.

14:19.990 --> 14:25.295
GOOD MORNING.
I'M BENNETT JAMES, CHLOE'S DAD.

14:25.295 --> 14:27.167
AS A PSYCHOLOGIST,

14:27.167 --> 14:30.300
I UTILIZE SPECIALIZED
THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES

14:30.300 --> 14:33.303
DESIGNED TO OFFER
BEHAVIOR MODIFICATIONS

14:33.303 --> 14:35.345
FOR A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANIC

14:35.345 --> 14:39.309
AND SOCIAL
PERSONALITY DISORDERS.

14:40.951 --> 14:44.084
HEY, WHO HAS
A PERSONALITY DISORDER?

14:45.315 --> 14:48.518
DADDY, SOCKS!
SHOW THEM YOUR SOCKS!

14:48.518 --> 14:51.361
DON'T WORRY, SWEETIE,
I GOT THIS.

14:51.361 --> 14:57.367
KIDS, PSYCHOLOGISTS HELP YOU
WITH YOUR EMOTIONAL BOO-BOOS.

14:57.367 --> 15:03.333
SOME KIDS GET SAD BECAUSE
DADDY OR MOMMY IS AWAY
ON BUSINESS ALL THE TIME.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.105
( crying )

15:05.105 --> 15:06.636
OR THEY CAN'T MAKE FRIENDS.

15:06.636 --> 15:08.478
( crying )

15:08.478 --> 15:11.581
OR THEY ALWAYS
GET PICKED LAST FOR THE TEAM.

15:11.581 --> 15:13.683
( all crying )

15:13.683 --> 15:16.686
AND IF YOU BUNCH THEM UP
BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR TOES IN,

15:16.686 --> 15:20.420
THEY'RE A LOT EASIER TO PULL UP!
( all crying )

15:20.420 --> 15:24.154
I FOUND MY REAL DADDY.
( all crying )

15:24.154 --> 15:25.996
DON'T WORRY, KIDS!
I'LL SAVE YOU!

15:25.996 --> 15:27.998
SUPER MOM IS HERE,
AND MY SUPER POWER

15:27.998 --> 15:30.330
IS MAKING IT RAIN
DELICIOUS TREATS!

15:30.330 --> 15:32.202
( all cheer )

15:32.202 --> 15:34.104
AND HERE'S MY SIDEKICK...

15:34.104 --> 15:35.435
SOCK MAN!

15:35.435 --> 15:37.107
( all laugh )

15:37.107 --> 15:38.268
( whispers )
THANK YOU.

15:38.268 --> 15:40.440
DADDY, TAKE ME WITH YOU.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.277
AVERY, YOUR FLOWER
IS BEAUTIFUL.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.279
OH, THANKS. ( chuckles )

15:49.279 --> 15:52.482
YEAH, YOURS
IS PRETTY GOOD, TOO.

15:52.482 --> 15:55.485
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU CAN'T DO?

15:55.485 --> 15:59.589
WELL, I HAVE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO WHISTLE.

15:59.589 --> 16:01.231
( blows )

16:01.231 --> 16:03.193
YOU NOW YOU NEED
TO USE YOUR TONGUE, RIGHT?

16:03.193 --> 16:05.535
OH!

16:05.535 --> 16:09.399
( whistling Beethoven's
Symphony No. 5 )

16:22.252 --> 16:24.514
WELL, I GUESS NOW
I CAN DO EVERYTHING.

16:26.156 --> 16:28.418
UH, LIKE FORGIVE TYLER.

16:28.418 --> 16:30.220
EXCEPT THAT.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.263
COME ON, NIKKI.
I THINK THERE'S MORE TO THIS
THAN YOU REALIZE.

16:33.263 --> 16:34.564
WHAT?

16:34.564 --> 16:36.166
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.098
YOU ARE JUST AS BAD AS HE IS!

16:38.098 --> 16:41.571
DON'T SAY THAT! I AM
NOWHERE NEAR AS BAD AS HE IS!

16:41.571 --> 16:45.105
HE LIES, AND YOU KEEP SECRETS.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.437
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

16:47.437 --> 16:49.779
AND NO ONE DOES
THE LIGHT-BULB WAVE ANYMORE.

16:49.779 --> 16:54.614
IT'S FIGURE EIGHT,
SO YOU CAN GET BOTH SIDES
OF THE STREET.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.786
GOOD-BYE!

16:56.786 --> 16:59.319
NO, NIKKI, WAIT!
I AM YOUR FRIEND!

16:59.319 --> 17:01.321
DIDN'T I TEACH YOU TO WHISTLE?!

17:01.321 --> 17:04.324
YOU'RE CRAZY! TYLER'S CRAZY!

17:04.324 --> 17:06.156
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY IS CRAZY!

17:06.156 --> 17:09.699
NO, NO, WE'RE NOT!
WE'RE A PERFECTLY NORMAL FAMILY!

17:09.699 --> 17:11.231
IT'S SOCK MAN!

17:11.231 --> 17:13.563
AND SUPER MOM!

17:13.563 --> 17:16.236
MY REAL DAD'S A JANITOR.

17:18.068 --> 17:19.609
NO, NIKKI, WAIT!

17:19.609 --> 17:21.441
I'M ONLY STICKING UP FOR TYLER

17:21.441 --> 17:24.574
BECAUSE HE HAD
A VERY GOOD REASON
FOR SAYING WHAT HE DID.

17:24.574 --> 17:27.677
FOR LYING THAT HIS DOG TOLD HIM
TO BE WITH ANOTHER GIRL?

17:27.677 --> 17:29.679
LOOK, IT WASN'T A LIE.

17:29.679 --> 17:32.222
I'M ONLY TELLING YOU THIS

17:32.222 --> 17:34.684
BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA
LOSE YOU AS A FRIEND.

17:34.684 --> 17:37.227
THERE'S A SECRET
WE'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.529
EVEN OUR PARENTS DON'T KNOW.

17:39.529 --> 17:42.462
STAN DID TELL TYLER
TO BE WITH THAT GIRL.

17:42.462 --> 17:47.137
TYLER KNOWS IT BECAUSE, UM...

17:47.137 --> 17:49.769
TYLER'S A DOG WHISPERER.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.402
TYLER COMMUNICATES WITH DOGS?

17:52.402 --> 17:54.604
OKAY, THAT'S JUST TOO CRAZY.

17:54.604 --> 17:58.178
NO, I KNOW IT SEEMS THAT WAY,
BUT I CAN PROVE IT.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.649
OKAY, TYLER,
WHEN NIKKI GETS HERE,

17:59.649 --> 18:02.652
YOU'LL BE BLINDFOLDED
AND I'LL SHOW STAN
A COUPLE OF OBJECTS.

18:02.652 --> 18:05.655
HE'LL "WHISPER" TO YOU
WHAT THEY ARE

18:05.655 --> 18:08.318
BY WHISPERING TO YOU
WHAT THEY ARE.

18:08.318 --> 18:11.521
AND YOU'LL IDENTIFY THE OBJECTS
BECAUSE, WELL,

18:11.521 --> 18:13.563
YOU'RE A DOG WHISPERER.

18:13.563 --> 18:16.366
YES! AND THEN NIKKI
WILL KNOW I WASN'T LYING.

18:16.366 --> 18:17.627
AND SHE'LL BE MY FRIEND AGAIN!

18:17.627 --> 18:19.369
SO WHAT DO I GET OUT
OF ALL THIS?

18:19.369 --> 18:22.502
YOU CAN LICK IN BETWEEN MY TOES
AFTER MY NEXT HIKE.

18:22.502 --> 18:26.806
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T GONNA
TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THAT.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.678
( Nikki whistling Beethoven's
Symphony No. 5 )

18:28.678 --> 18:30.210
SHE'S HERE!

18:33.643 --> 18:35.545
HEY, NIKKI,
WE ARE READY TO SHOW YOU

18:35.545 --> 18:38.518
THAT TYLER CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH STAN.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.820
I AM JUST GONNA HOLD UP
A FEW OBJECTS HERE AND--

18:40.820 --> 18:44.524
NO. IF YOU WANT TO PROVE TO ME
THAT TYLER CAN TALK TO DOGS,

18:44.524 --> 18:45.895
HAVE HIM TALK TO EVITA.

18:45.895 --> 18:47.527
Both: UH...

18:47.527 --> 18:50.360
SHE'S WEAK AND SHE WON'T EAT.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.662
YOU CAN FIND OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER, NO?

18:52.662 --> 18:55.265
( scoffs )
OF COURSE HE CAN.

18:55.265 --> 18:57.237
UH, AVERY, CAN I JUST
TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
YEAH.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.608
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY.

18:58.608 --> 18:59.809
THIS WILL JUST
TAKE A SECOND.

18:59.809 --> 19:02.472
( arguing )

19:02.472 --> 19:03.643
( groans )

19:03.643 --> 19:06.646
I WILL NOW FIND OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH EVITA.

19:09.179 --> 19:10.650
HELP US.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.354
( sniffs )

19:14.354 --> 19:15.525
I SMELL SOMETHING.

19:15.525 --> 19:17.827
SHE HAS A BUR IN HER PAW.

19:17.827 --> 19:20.159
HOW DO I TELL TYLER?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.191
SHE'S, UH...

19:21.191 --> 19:22.192
IT'S THE PAW.

19:22.192 --> 19:23.833
THERE'S SOMETHING IN HER PAW.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.595
UM...

19:25.595 --> 19:29.469
UH, SHE'S SCREWING IN
A LIGHT BULB!

19:29.469 --> 19:30.840
UH, SHE WANTS TO BE
THE ROSE QUEEN!

19:30.840 --> 19:32.842
OKAY, CHARADES ARE OUT.

19:32.842 --> 19:34.244
PLAN B.

19:35.605 --> 19:40.310
"THERE'S A BUN IN HER PAN."

19:41.581 --> 19:42.782
GIVE ME A BREAK, OKAY?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.584
I'M WRITING FAST
AND I DON'T HAVE THUMBS.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.916
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
WE ARE LEAVING.

19:46.916 --> 19:49.759
NO, NO, NO, WAIT.
HE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.

19:49.759 --> 19:54.264
OKAY, UH...
( clears throat )

19:54.264 --> 19:57.597
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.598
( phone rings )

19:58.598 --> 19:59.799
I'M GETTING A PHONE CALL.

20:01.671 --> 20:04.374
DUDE, THERE'S A BUR IN HER PAW.

20:05.535 --> 20:08.678
DUDE, THERE'S A BUR IN HER PAW!

20:08.678 --> 20:10.980
YES, THERE IS!

20:10.980 --> 20:12.642
THAT WAS AMAZING!

20:12.642 --> 20:14.514
( whimpers )

20:14.514 --> 20:16.616
I GOT IT OUT.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.388
( barks )

20:18.388 --> 20:19.989
PUT IT BACK IN!
PUT IT BACK IN!

20:21.751 --> 20:25.725
EVITA AND I
WILL NEVER FORGET THIS.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.399
MOSTLY BECAUSE IT WAS WEIRD.

20:29.399 --> 20:31.561
I'M SORRY
I CALLED YOU BOTH LIARS.

20:31.561 --> 20:33.563
I WOULD NEVER LIE TO YOU, NIKKI.

20:33.563 --> 20:35.765
UNLESS I HAD A VERY GOOD REASON.

20:35.765 --> 20:40.009
TYLER, IT REALLY WAS AMAZING.
BRAVO.

20:40.009 --> 20:41.841
WELL, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.872
( gasps )

20:42.872 --> 20:45.575
HE-HE DONATES
STRIPS OF HIS HAIR

20:45.575 --> 20:47.547
TO MEN
WHO CAN'T GROW BEARDS!

20:47.547 --> 20:50.550
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET!

20:50.550 --> 20:52.552
I HAVE THREE UNCLES
WHO CAN'T GROW BEARDS.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.984
WILL YOU HELP THEM?

20:56.726 --> 20:58.528
SO ONCE AGAIN,
I HAD MY BRO'S BACK.

20:58.528 --> 21:00.360
THAT'S WHY
THERE'S NO GREATER HONOR

21:00.360 --> 21:01.691
THAN BEING A WINGMAN.

21:01.691 --> 21:03.533
JUST LIKE TYLER
HELPED OUT NIKKI'S UNCLES.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.798
I GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
OUT OF IT, TOO.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.676
YOU TWO WAIT RIGHT HERE.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.809
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH SOME FROYO... FO' YO'.

21:21.451 --> 21:23.683
SO HE REALLY
DOESN'T STUDY SOCKS?

21:23.683 --> 21:24.684
NOPE.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.015
THEN WHAT DOES
HE DO FOR A JOB?

21:26.015 --> 21:29.819
HE MAKES KIDS CRY
AND THEN GIVES THEM TREATS.

21:29.819 --> 21:32.692
IS THERE MUCH
OF A LIVING IN THAT?

21:32.692 --> 21:34.724
I MEAN, HOW CAN HE AFFORD
OUR BEAUTIFUL HOUSE?

21:34.724 --> 21:36.866
MY MOM'S A SUPERHERO.

21:36.866 --> 21:40.400
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.403
ROB, YOU COME BACK WITH THOSE!

21:43.403 --> 21:47.907
( panting ) ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT FRIDAY.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.781
( sighs )
