00:25.359 --> 00:27.361
[people chattering]

00:38.539 --> 00:40.290
[Tony Sr.] Oh, yeah. There we go.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.334
Here we are. [laughs]

00:42.417 --> 00:44.419
[smells the environment]

00:44.753 --> 00:47.256
How did you talk me into this?
Why can't I say no to you?

00:47.339 --> 00:48.757
Oh, would you relax?

00:49.049 --> 00:51.426
You've been moaning and groaning
ever since we left Brooklyn.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.846
-These cop retreats are a blast.
-You sure they don't mind you attending?

00:54.930 --> 00:56.723
You're not on probation anymore,
but still.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.476
-I'm an adjunct detective.
-There's no such thing.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.103
Want to see my badge?

01:02.271 --> 01:04.356
Yeah, you know what?
I'd love to see your badge.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.441
Adjunct detectives don't need a badge.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.153
Anthony, two o' clock.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.283
No. Two... Two o' clock.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.832
Who is she?

01:21.915 --> 01:22.874
Who is she?

01:22.958 --> 01:25.002
That's for you to find out,
I don't know.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.299
-I could run her plates.
-Or you could talk to her.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.175
Buy her a drink. Ask her, her name.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.136
All right fine, run her plates,

01:34.219 --> 01:36.430
but I want a DNA test. I really do.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.557
I got to know who your mother was humpin'.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.526

01:53.739 --> 01:55.282
[Tony Sr.] Hey, look at this.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.950
[laughs in excitment] Look at that.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.827
[men cheering]

01:58.994 --> 02:00.746
[man] The party's officially begun.

-[people laughing]
-[Tony Sr. laughing]

02:04.124 --> 02:05.876
-Hey Biggie.
-Hey.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.836
Danny boy, what do you say, kid?

02:08.128 --> 02:10.714
Hey, look who I dragged up.
My boy, my son.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.382
Hi. Hello. Hi. Tony Jr.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.052
Everybody needs a designated driver.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.345
What are you talking about?

02:16.428 --> 02:17.929
The kid's gonna be great.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.307
We won't even be able to keep up with him.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.142
Burl was telling us about a traffic stop.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.812
Two weeks ago, I clocked this couple
doing 85, maybe 90, on the FDR.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.481
I pull them over, I said:

02:28.065 --> 02:28.899
"Ma'am,

02:28.982 --> 02:30.859
does your husband always drive
that fast?"

02:31.109 --> 02:33.278
She said:Â "Only when he's drunk."

02:35.572 --> 02:36.406
I love that one.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.745
Actually... I think I've heard that one.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.622
That's an old joke or something.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.627
We can Google it.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.214
We're gonna check in.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.465
Alright. [laughs]

02:53.965 --> 02:56.093
-Come on, we'll Google it over there.
-Alright.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.178
I'll be back. See you guys in a minute.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.431
Let's see here.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.059
Can you use that one? No. No.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.520
Master charge, remember that?

03:06.603 --> 03:07.771
[people chattering]

03:07.896 --> 03:11.358
I don't even know who this guy is...
Oh yeah, let's give that one a try.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.903
Really? Can you look again? It's...

03:15.112 --> 03:17.739
sort of important to me.
I requested the top floor.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.534
I'm afraid that's all we have.
The resort is completely booked.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.536
Hi.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.495
Excuse me.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.540
We're on the top floor, we can swap.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.085
The kindness of strangers. Thank you.

03:30.502 --> 03:33.088
Ms. Clark is in a single.
I'm afraid it wouldn't work.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.007
Points for trying.

03:36.091 --> 03:36.925
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

03:37.008 --> 03:37.843
Yeah.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.262
[sighs and whispers] Oh, God!

03:40.345 --> 03:42.347
[whispering to each other]

03:46.101 --> 03:48.061
So are you here for the convention?

03:48.729 --> 03:51.940
Me? No, no.
I'm just a lowly, boring civilian.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.900
-I guess it's me and 400 cops.
-Yeah.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.362
-At least you know you're safe.
-Am I?

04:00.282 --> 04:02.159
Hi, I'm Tony Caruso.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.785
This my boy, Tony, Jr.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.996
-Oh.
-You know, he's a pretty big wheel.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.248
Yeah, yeah. Lieutenant Detective.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.167
Three times decorated. [laughs]

04:10.917 --> 04:13.837
I never travel without my press agent.
[laughs]

04:14.212 --> 04:15.589
Lieutenant Detective.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.758
I'm duly impressed.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.176
Macy Clark.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.346
So let me get this straight,
you came to a ski resort to ski?

04:24.181 --> 04:25.223
Pretty unorthodox.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.350
So crazy it just might work.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.272
-Maybe I'll see you in the bar later?
-Not if I see you first.

04:33.023 --> 04:33.857
I mean.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.734
I'd like to see you first.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.153
That's not ready to help me.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.696
You don't need any help.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.156
I know what you mean.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.033
Until then.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.701
[people chattering]

04:44.826 --> 04:45.660
Come on.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.703
Come on. Let's go.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.413
Thank you very much. [chuckles]

04:48.497 --> 04:50.540
-Bye. Luggage. Come on.
-Yeah, okay, bye.

04:50.665 --> 04:51.500
[Macy] Bye.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.586
-[elevator dings]
-Alright, here we go.

04:55.962 --> 04:56.797
"Until then."

04:57.380 --> 04:59.633
-That's good, right?
-Oh, until then is great.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.927
It's one of the best things
a person could say,

05:02.010 --> 05:03.887
because it contains the word<i> then.</i>

05:04.054 --> 05:05.597
<i>Then </i>is a definite thing.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.600
Something is going to happen <i>then.</i>
[laughs]

05:08.683 --> 05:09.851
Hey, here we are, 301.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.146
[door-lock beeps]

05:14.314 --> 05:15.273
Hey, not bad.

05:17.859 --> 05:18.693
I'll take this one.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.655
Closest to the bathroom
for obvious reasons.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.990
You know, Dad, you were right.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.077
-I think I needed this.
-Yeah.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.247
Look at these seminars.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.210
"Crime scene reconstruction. Managing
your evidence room." These are great.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.004
Wait.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.923
Wait.

05:40.006 --> 05:40.841
No.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.426
"Ethics in modern police work.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.179

former detective NYPD,

05:46.263 --> 05:47.347
and Tony Caruso Jr."

05:47.430 --> 05:50.225
-You signed me up to speak?
-Yeah, come on. It'll be fun.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.477
We'll talk for ten minutes,
then there'll be some Q&A.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.436
I'm not prepared.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.771
What's to prepare?

05:54.938 --> 05:57.190
We're talking about ethics.
You be Pro, I'll be Con.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.861
-No, no. Not doing it. Definitely not.
-Hey, show some gratitude here.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.696
Wasn't easy getting you on that panel.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.656
Had to slip the organizer
a little do-re-mi.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.575
Wait up.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.536
You bribed a guy to get me
on the Ethics panel?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.454
Yeah, it cost me 50 bucks.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.708
[both laughing]

06:15.667 --> 06:16.501
What?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.130
Oh, you know what?

06:20.630 --> 06:21.965
I've changed my mind, Dad.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.594
-This sounds like fun. I'm definitely in.
-There you go. That's my boy.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.679
[Tony Jr. continues laughing]

06:28.221 --> 06:30.473
Can't wait to see the guys.
It'll be great.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.977
Look at this. This guy's getting
an early start on the weekend.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.313
You bring your necktie?

06:36.563 --> 06:38.690
-You said this was casual.
-That's alright, don't worry.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.818
You can borrow mine. Unless I'm using it.
[laughs]

06:42.819 --> 06:44.529
How much fun is this? Come on.

-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

06:48.241 --> 06:50.577
[man] You can do
between two and 300 push-ups?

06:50.702 --> 06:53.830
-[Tony Sr.] That's what I said.
-[man] I got a c note that says no way.

06:55.040 --> 06:55.999
Okay. Hey.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.210
[sighs] One. Two. Three. [huffs]

07:00.879 --> 07:01.713
Thank you very much.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.842
-[man] You said between two and 300.
-I did three. That's between two and 300.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.470
-[all laugh]
-[Tony Sr.] Sucker.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.641
Come on. Let's go see Bobby G.
Hey, I'm buying.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.354
Looks like something's wrong
with my glass.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.688
What, what is it?

07:18.813 --> 07:19.648
It's empty.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.317
-Do you want anything?
-No, I'm good. Thank you.

-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

07:44.339 --> 07:45.757
Don't let me interrupt you.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.260
Macy. What are you doing here?

07:50.387 --> 07:53.098
I don't know what he just said to you,
but he's lying.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.476
Is it too warm in here, Andre?

07:57.435 --> 07:59.187
Is that why you took off
your wedding ring?

07:59.854 --> 08:00.939
-Wait, what?
-Okay.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.274
Okay. Macy, if you want to go
talk about this--

08:03.358 --> 08:04.943
That's what I wanted to do.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.945
I came here to talk.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.364
I had a whole speech prepared...

08:10.281 --> 08:12.492
about respect and trust.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.328
[sighs] I rehearsed it 100 times.

08:16.955 --> 08:17.998
But you know what?

08:18.373 --> 08:20.250
I'm just going to sum it up like this.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.585
-[man grunts]
-[woman gasps]

08:32.637 --> 08:33.805
[Macy sighs]

08:35.598 --> 08:36.433
Hi.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.977
You here to arrest me?

08:39.769 --> 08:40.895
No, ma'am. [laughs]

08:41.438 --> 08:42.856
I have a history with him.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.526
Good. If he was a stranger,
I'd be pretty worried.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.237
I'm taking a big risk here.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.406
-[Macy sighs]
-It's...

08:51.781 --> 08:55.118
pretty awkward. I had to ask the poor guy
what you're drinking. [both laugh]

08:56.828 --> 08:59.372
-[Tony Jr. clears throat]
-We had a thing last year.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.292
Everybody knew he was married,
everybody, but me.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.463
I'm a middle school guidance counselor,
even my kids knew.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.340
[Macy tsks] Closure is...

09:09.883 --> 09:11.259
a lot harder than it looks.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.678
Yeah. Closure is...

09:14.220 --> 09:15.096
tricky.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.266
So what now? [sighs]

09:19.642 --> 09:20.518
Well...

09:21.394 --> 09:24.397
I can either go home
and bemoan my fate or...

09:24.481 --> 09:25.815
[takes deep breath]

09:25.940 --> 09:28.860
I can bemoan my fate here,
and get a little skiing in.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.696
I like plan B. [laughs] If...

09:32.155 --> 09:34.491
-my vote means anything--
-I'm a really fun person.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.326
-Yeah. [laughs]
-I really am.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.703
When I'm not a total psychotic--

09:38.787 --> 09:39.829
No.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.833
Maybe I'll see you on the slopes tomorrow?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.169
I don't ski.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.673
You don't ski well
or you don't ski at all?

09:51.508 --> 09:52.550
I've never tried it.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.470
Lt. Caruso that is...

09:56.346 --> 09:58.389
unacceptable, that's unforgivable.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.433
My Nana...

10:00.642 --> 10:02.644
used to say, may she rest in peace,

10:03.311 --> 10:05.647
"Life is an adventure or it's nothing."

10:07.565 --> 10:09.692
-I like that.
-No, you can't just say, "I like that."

10:09.776 --> 10:11.152
You have to believe it.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.445
You have to...

10:12.529 --> 10:13.363
embrace it.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.123
Life is an adventure...

10:23.498 --> 10:24.499
or it's nothing.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.128
[both chuckle]

10:47.730 --> 10:48.565
Macy.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.401
Mac--

10:56.156 --> 10:58.867
Excuse me.
Sorry, we're old friends. Thanks.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.455
No. Macy, we're not doing this right now.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.082
I know. I'm sorry, I...

11:06.666 --> 11:09.335
just want to apologize. I feel terrible...

11:09.419 --> 11:11.254
-about last night.
-Well.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.172
Just...

11:12.297 --> 11:14.090
give me five minutes, hear me out.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.341
Then I swear...

11:15.633 --> 11:17.010
I'm out of your life.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.388
I just don't want to grow old hating you.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.515
[cablecar machine running and grinding]

11:23.349 --> 11:24.309
[sighs]

11:24.934 --> 11:25.768
Okay.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.044
Does everybody remember how to stop?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.087
We make a pizza slice.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.591
Keep your toes together,
and we push our heels out.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.552
Everybody show me a pizza slice.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.388
Very nice.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.808
Okay, are we ready to ski?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.937
Okay. See you guys at the bottom.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.439
Go.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.209
Pizza slice. Pizza!

12:38.925 --> 12:39.759
I'm okay.

12:57.026 --> 12:57.944
He's been stabbed!

12:58.778 --> 12:59.821
Call an ambulance!

12:59.988 --> 13:02.240
-Oh my God. Andre!
-[man] Call an ambulance

13:02.699 --> 13:03.783
Andre! Oh my God!

13:04.325 --> 13:05.618
-What happened?
-I don't know!

13:05.702 --> 13:06.536
Go get an ambulance!

13:07.287 --> 13:08.371
[Macy yelling] Help him!

13:08.454 --> 13:10.790
Andre!

13:10.873 --> 13:13.042
Oh my God!

13:13.626 --> 13:15.628
[announcement]

13:18.256 --> 13:19.799
-What's going on?
-A cop's been killed.

13:19.882 --> 13:20.925
He's up there on the lift.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.218
Who was it?

13:22.385 --> 13:23.845
The sergeant from the two-five.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.929
Andre Rifkin.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.974
I've known him for years.
He's the guy your friend's involved with.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.560
-Roger that. Good to know.
-Suspect's in custody.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.773
[policemen chattering]

13:35.857 --> 13:37.233
Alright, turn to your left.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.293
Hello.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.504
I'm here to see Macy Clark.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.381
It's not your case, Lieutenant.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.425
It's not official. I'm a friend.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.929
A friend?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.356
Hey.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.524
Tony.

14:18.733 --> 14:19.734
Are you okay?

14:20.568 --> 14:21.986
I don't know. I'm just...

14:22.820 --> 14:23.821
numb.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.452
They took my watch. What time is it?

14:32.538 --> 14:33.373
4:30.

14:34.957 --> 14:35.792
They won't...

14:35.875 --> 14:36.709
look at me...

14:37.543 --> 14:38.544
or talk to me.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.881
A cop was killed, so it's...

14:42.173 --> 14:43.132
like family.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.927
Do you have a lawyer?

14:46.636 --> 14:49.305
I bought a house.
I used a lawyer for that.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.348
No, I mean...

14:50.932 --> 14:51.849
a criminal lawyer.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.104
I know a few people.
I can make some calls.

14:56.521 --> 14:57.355
Tony.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.566
I didn't do anything. I didn't touch him.
I would never, Tony.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.484
Macy...

15:03.069 --> 15:03.986
What happened up there?

15:04.278 --> 15:05.488
-Did he hit you?
-No.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.323
Did he threaten you?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.617
[sobs] No. I wanted to talk to him.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.704
We were up there on the lift.
I apologized or...

15:14.497 --> 15:15.665
at least I tried to.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.875
He was worried
I was going to call his wife.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.043
I swore I wouldn't.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.629
[sighs] Oh God, it was pretty tense.

15:23.548 --> 15:27.009
After a minute, he just stopped talking,
and so I figured he was still angry.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.387
And so I just gave up,
and I put in my headphones,

15:29.470 --> 15:30.972
and I listened to some music,

15:31.097 --> 15:33.141
and I enjoyed the view.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.476
He was fine?

15:35.685 --> 15:36.519
Yes! He was...

15:36.769 --> 15:37.645
he was fine.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.232
He was fine and we reached the top,
I turned around and...

15:41.816 --> 15:43.484
there was a knife, it was...

15:43.943 --> 15:44.777
in him.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.571
Macy, it was just you and him.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.074
You were alone. You know how this looks.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.243
Yeah.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.164
I'm not going to lie, I used to...
lie awake at night...

15:56.456 --> 15:57.498
wishing he was dead.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.626
Well.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.130
I wouldn't mention that to anybody.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.133
It's crazy. I wouldn't believe me either.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.385
[sighs]

16:09.886 --> 16:12.597
[starts crying]
This is going to kill my mother.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.932
[sniffs and sighs]

16:21.731 --> 16:24.150
[Burl]
Andre Rifkin was the best cop I ever met.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.569
First guy through the door
every damn time.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.487
[Tony Sr.] Yeah.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.156
You know, I knew him when he worked
Narcotics out of the two-five.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.493
He'd walk into the interrogation room
with a baseball bat.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.120
The perp would see it and go,
"Hey, what's that?"

16:36.454 --> 16:37.497
And Andre would say,

16:37.622 --> 16:39.832
[all together] "It's my lie detector."

16:39.916 --> 16:41.542
[everybody laughs]

16:42.919 --> 16:43.753
[forks clinking]

16:43.836 --> 16:45.046
I'm sorry man that's...

16:45.588 --> 16:47.757
That's a tough way
for a good man to go out.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.509
He was just sitting there...

16:49.759 --> 16:51.677
and she just stabbed him like like a...

16:51.969 --> 16:53.137
like a sucker punch.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.764
At least give the guy a chance.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.307
Now hey,

16:56.390 --> 16:57.225
a toast.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.853
"To live in hearts we leave behind
is not to die."

17:01.020 --> 17:02.063
-Amen
-Salute.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.357
-[glasses clinking]
-To Andre.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.435
I wouldn't expect
a lot of Christmas cards this year.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.481
Word gets around.
You're helping her find a lawyer?

17:46.023 --> 17:48.025
[laughs] I got to tell you, kid.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.986
I love you dearly, but...

17:50.319 --> 17:52.572
I got one foot out the door myself
on this one.

17:52.697 --> 17:53.698
She killed a cop.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.491
She says she didn't do it.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.702
[sighs] Everybody says they didn't do it.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.663
Nobody's guilty.
I just spent seven years upstate.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.748
I was the only guilty guy in the place.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.670
-Thanks for staying, Burl.
-Don't read too much into it.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.880
I like these little red potatoes.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.220
What happened? She batted her eyes?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.598
You got smitten?
Your heart went a flutter?

18:18.973 --> 18:21.350
I'm telling you kid,
you got a blind spot on this.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.602
You're not thinking straight.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.937
[Burl] What's her story?
Temporary insanity?

18:25.021 --> 18:27.440
-No.
-Let me guess. Self-defense.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.986
They were talking for a minute...
she puts in her headphones,

18:32.069 --> 18:33.696
next thing she knows he's dead.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.823
Burl, I can't even listen to this.

18:36.324 --> 18:39.327
-They were on a ski lift.
-Yeah. Exactly, Dad.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.330
If she's gonna kill somebody,
why would she kill him that way?

18:42.413 --> 18:44.540
Why would anybody kill somebody that way?

18:44.624 --> 18:47.084
Why? What do you mean why?
She's a woman scorned.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.711
And why? Who cares why?

18:48.919 --> 18:50.129
Nobody ever knows why.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.924
I'm telling you, TJ...
you got enough problems fitting in.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.217
I'm not trying to be popular.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.429
It's got nothing to do with being popular.
It's life or death.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.223
Are you kidding me?
When you go through that door...

19:01.307 --> 19:02.808
when it hits the fan...

19:03.392 --> 19:05.895
who's going to have your back?
You need these guys.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.981
Tell me more about Rifkin.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.651
Did he have any other enemies?

19:11.901 --> 19:13.527
Anyone other than Macy?

19:15.237 --> 19:17.323
There was a thing about five years back.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.450
Your dad was still on his sabbatical.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.576
He was in prison.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.414
Andre was shift Commander at the one-nine.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.000
Gave some newbie a bad evaluation.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.211
Nearly cost the guy his shield.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.047
They ended up duking it out
at the station house.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.466
We had to pry the guys apart.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.134
Who was it?

19:37.635 --> 19:38.803
Hell, if I remember...

19:39.428 --> 19:40.304
I'll ask around.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.847
It doesn't matter.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.432
What we're sure of is...

19:43.516 --> 19:45.518
he wasn't on the ski lift.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.606
Actually I've been thinking about that.
And, what if...

19:51.148 --> 19:52.233
there's another explanation?

19:53.401 --> 19:54.610
Another explanation.

19:55.778 --> 19:56.737
I can show you.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.657
I just need ten minutes
and if I'm wrong, I will back off,

19:59.740 --> 20:01.575
I will not talk to Macy, ever again.

20:01.659 --> 20:02.952
[laughs] Lead the way.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.122
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.838
Here is a photo of the murder weapon.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.923
Sheriff gave me a copy.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.843
A stiletto? Ladies love them.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.928
What's that on the end, a notch?

20:21.137 --> 20:24.932
This ice pick is eight inches long.
Same length as the knife.

20:25.850 --> 20:26.976
This is our victim...

20:28.394 --> 20:29.729
Andre Rifkin.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.940
Good God, Anthony.
They haven't even buried the guy.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.276
No disrespect intended.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.570
The knife was taped to the bar.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.572
Okay. Here we go.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.950
Andre and Macy climb into the chair.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.119
The safety bar goes down.

20:50.541 --> 20:51.625
What does that prove?

20:52.042 --> 20:53.669
It proves she might be innocent...

20:53.878 --> 20:58.090
and I believe that she is,
and I will do everything that I have to do

20:58.174 --> 21:00.718
for as long as it takes
to clear that woman's name.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.845
Excuse me. [clears throat]

21:03.554 --> 21:05.222
You said after the lift started,

21:05.556 --> 21:08.684
they talked for a couple of minutes,
about their relationship?

21:09.059 --> 21:10.186
Yeah. That's right.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.563
[Burl] I don't know.
It's been my experience,

21:12.646 --> 21:14.607
when a man has been stabbed in the chest

21:14.690 --> 21:16.442
that's pretty much
all he wants to talk about.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.569
Whatever conversation you're having...

21:19.445 --> 21:20.863
sports, weather...

21:21.322 --> 21:24.200
you'll always try to guide the subject
back to the fact

21:24.283 --> 21:26.118
that he's got a knife in his chest.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.620
It's almost like an obsession.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.247
[sniffs]

21:32.374 --> 21:34.376
[takes a deep breath]

21:36.003 --> 21:36.879
Yeah.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.174
[laughs] Yeah, you're right.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.302
It's crazy.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.307
[sighs]

21:55.815 --> 21:58.567
-She did it.
-Yes. Yes, thank you.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.485
Thank you.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.654
Thank you. Welcome back to the world.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.864
You're my son again. [laughs]

22:04.740 --> 22:07.451
I didn't want to tell you before,
but earlier today, I disowned you.

22:07.535 --> 22:11.163
I can't wait to tell the guys.
You're alright. [laughs]

22:25.344 --> 22:27.680
-Thank you.
-[participants applauding]

22:28.347 --> 22:30.683
-What am I doing at an Ethics panel?
-[all laugh]

22:31.308 --> 22:35.354
I mean it's like taking nutrition tips
from Buddy O' Mara. [all laugh]

22:35.437 --> 22:37.690
Just kidding, Buddy.
You look great, Buddy.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.568
[female presenter]
TJ, let's start with you.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.820
What was it like in that house,
growing up?

22:43.612 --> 22:45.614
Lots of fun, watching my father grow up.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.199
[all laugh]

22:47.324 --> 22:49.034
Very funny, very cute.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.286
My son, he's funny.

22:50.911 --> 22:51.745
Seriously.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.080
It was wonderful.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.791
We had everything we ever wanted.
I just...

22:55.875 --> 22:57.793
wasn't allowed to ask where we got it.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.628
[all laugh]

22:59.712 --> 23:01.547
I'd like to talk about
what it's like today

23:01.630 --> 23:03.549
for a young officer on the street.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.593
Obviously, temptation is everywhere.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.011
Yeah, Dad, what's that quote,

23:07.094 --> 23:08.721
that Oscar Wilde quote you like?

23:08.929 --> 23:10.681
Oh, yeah. Yeah I can...

23:11.056 --> 23:13.475
"I can resist everything
except temptation."

23:13.559 --> 23:15.519
[laughs] Oscar Wilde, my kind of cop.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.354
I could partner with him.

23:17.438 --> 23:18.939
[all laugh]

23:19.023 --> 23:20.024
Look...

23:20.107 --> 23:21.525
all officers make mistakes.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.987
The important thing is
that we never stop learning.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.531
For example. Recently, I...

23:28.032 --> 23:30.409
learned a valuable lesson from my father.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.077
And what was that?

23:33.162 --> 23:34.747
Well, as all of you know...

23:34.997 --> 23:38.417
I recently got involved in the death
of our friend, Andre Rifkin.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.587
I got involved with a suspect.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.255
Too involved.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.675
My dad called me out on it
and he was right.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.096
It won't happen again.
I can promise you that.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.147
Okay, let's get back to ethics.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.024
Here's a hypothetical.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.610
You and your partner respond
to a traffic accident.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.153
Before the car is towed,

24:06.445 --> 24:08.739
you see your partner pocketing
a stack of bills.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.824
How do you respond?
Do you approach him...

24:11.367 --> 24:12.993
-there on the--
-I'm so sorry.

24:13.827 --> 24:14.787
Excuse me.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.332
I just noticed that picture.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.586
Is there someone
at the top of the ski lift that

24:22.670 --> 24:24.254
helps to assist people off the chair?

24:24.338 --> 24:25.673
Oh my god.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.300
Yes, there's always a staff member
on the platform.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.178
-That's it.
-[Tony Sr. whispers] No, son.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.930
That's what happened.
It was the attendant.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.765
[all start oohing]

24:34.848 --> 24:36.934
It was the attendant.
No, no he could have...

24:37.017 --> 24:38.936
stabbed Andre Rifkin
while getting off the chair.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.479
He had the means and the opportunity.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.439
Son, Jr. , don't do this.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.108
No, no let's do this. Let's try this.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.275
This is the ski lift.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.276
This is the ski lift.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.653
Okay. Um...

24:47.778 --> 24:50.406
Guys, we can solve the case right here.
We can do it. Dad,

24:50.489 --> 24:53.325
you be Andre Rifkin,
if you could just sit here, please?

24:53.993 --> 24:54.910
Alright.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.414
I just need a volunteer.

25:01.417 --> 25:02.251
Anybody?

25:04.503 --> 25:05.337
Buddy?

25:08.549 --> 25:09.383
No?

25:10.217 --> 25:11.093
Okay, Karen?

25:12.052 --> 25:14.054
[takes a deep breath] Thank you.

25:14.805 --> 25:15.931
You be Macy Clark.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.058
I will be the attendant.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.395
Okay. Here comes the chair.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.939
-[people start murmuring]
-Up goes the safety rail.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.941
Macy Clark exits the chair.

25:26.734 --> 25:27.901
While nobody's looking...

25:28.986 --> 25:30.154
I stabbed the victim--

25:30.237 --> 25:31.864
-[man] She's guilty!
-[people yelling]

25:31.989 --> 25:33.574
No, we don't know that.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.325
See, now we have reasonable doubt.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.453
[man] You don't know
what you're talking about.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.705
You don't know her, okay?
You've never met her.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.374
There is such a thing
as presumption of innocence.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.960
[people jeer at Tony Jr.]

25:45.836 --> 25:47.546
I think we have time for some Q&A.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.468
I'm sure your next panel
will go a lot smoother.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.429
I think the Battle of Gettysburg
went a lot smoother.

25:55.763 --> 25:56.597
Lieutenant?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.682
You wanted to see
the weekend work schedule?

25:58.766 --> 25:59.808
Thank you. Yes.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.269
The sheriff was here all day.
He questioned everybody.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.938
Well, he questioned them as witnesses,
not as suspects.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.690
Who's Daryl Teasdale?

26:07.232 --> 26:08.275
Daryl. Yeah.

26:08.901 --> 26:09.902
They call him Diesel.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.363
He was working on the platform
when Andre was stabbed.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.617
-Do you know where he is?
-Probably in the break room?

26:17.993 --> 26:18.827
Thank you.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.208
[people chattering]

26:31.632 --> 26:32.633
Daryl Teasdale?

26:33.967 --> 26:34.802
Yeah, maybe.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.304
Got a minute?

26:38.263 --> 26:39.848
I don't think so, man. No.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.141
-Relax.
-No.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.644
I don't think so.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.901
[both grunting]

26:56.782 --> 26:57.866
No biting.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.035
[both huff and puff]

27:00.744 --> 27:01.578
No.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.750
[thumping guy with a pan]

27:12.714 --> 27:14.925
Burl called me.
What's all this about a ski lift?

27:15.050 --> 27:15.926
[pants]

27:21.014 --> 27:23.058
Got some good news.
Think you can handle it?

27:23.851 --> 27:27.396
I don't know. I haven't had a lot
of experience with that lately.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.274
There's a kid at the resort.
Daryl Teasdale. Do you know him?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.776
He was at the ski lifts when you got off.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.778
-He's got a jacket two feet long.
-A jacket?

27:34.862 --> 27:35.904
A record.

27:36.029 --> 27:36.947
Possession with intent,

27:37.030 --> 27:38.907
-grand theft, B&E.
-Did he do it?

27:39.324 --> 27:41.535
When I went to question him,
he took off like a rabbit.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.412
What does that mean?

27:44.580 --> 27:45.873
It means you have to stay strong.

27:46.540 --> 27:47.374
Can you do that?

27:54.256 --> 27:55.674
[Cora clears throat]

27:56.216 --> 27:57.426
Hi, I'm Cora.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.846
Caruso, there's something
I think you should see.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.067
Where is Daryl?

28:14.735 --> 28:15.569
Cut him loose.

28:16.028 --> 28:16.862
Why?

28:17.613 --> 28:20.616
To reduce the chances
of him lawyering up and suing us.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.117
Caruso, he didn't do it.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.076
Why'd he run?

28:23.160 --> 28:23.994
He always runs.

28:24.578 --> 28:27.331
He sells weed on the side.
He supplies the whole resort.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.166
Most of the staff, half the guests...

28:29.249 --> 28:31.543
Chasing that kid
is the only exercise I get.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.253
Lowery, show him the tape.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.547
We got a video of them on the ski lift.

28:37.007 --> 28:39.176
-I thought you said there weren't cameras.
-We got lucky.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.386
One of the guests was wearing
one of them GoPro deals.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.519
[Cora] There's the knife.
He was dead before he reached the top.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.107
So... that's it, then.

29:30.060 --> 29:30.978
She's asleep.

29:33.981 --> 29:35.983
[sighs deeply]

29:41.154 --> 29:42.406
I'm glad you met someone.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.659
She didn't do it.

29:47.661 --> 29:48.578
Do believe me?

29:49.621 --> 29:50.455
No.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.626
But I'm glad you met someone.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.131
-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

30:02.884 --> 30:03.719
Good morning.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.179
Complimentary breakfast.
You can make your own omelette.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.472
Maybe later.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.268
You look like something I stepped in.
You sleep at all?

30:11.977 --> 30:12.811
Not really.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.440
-I thought we weren't talking.
-Course we're talking.

30:16.565 --> 30:17.858
How's your girlfriend?

30:18.150 --> 30:20.652
-She's not my girlfriend.
-Don't say that, Anthony.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.196
If you don't love her,
it's 100 times worse.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.034
You helped her make bail?

30:27.743 --> 30:28.910
I called Frank Wrigley.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.287
He posted her bond.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.913
So she's back on the street.

30:32.581 --> 30:33.415
That's great.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.084
I asked around.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.047
That newbie Rifkin had that beef with...

30:41.340 --> 30:43.467
his name was, I wrote it down here...

30:44.301 --> 30:45.218
Maury Peppitone.

30:46.470 --> 30:47.637
How's this helping us?

30:48.221 --> 30:50.849
-Well, he was asking for--
-Burl. You're not helping.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.894
I'm serious, Anthony. She killed a cop.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.438
If she's in your life...

30:57.606 --> 30:58.815
I'm not sure I can be.

31:02.069 --> 31:02.903
Toast, Burl.

31:03.612 --> 31:07.157
How the hell do you eat an omelet
without toast, that's what I want to know.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.369
[door dings]

31:10.619 --> 31:12.621
[water pouring]

31:14.831 --> 31:15.707
[door closes]

31:17.751 --> 31:18.585
Hello?

31:19.127 --> 31:20.045
Tony?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.674
[sighs] I've been in there for an hour.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.803
Couldn't get the smell of that cell
off of me.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.354
How did you get in here?

31:38.271 --> 31:39.356
The maid let me in.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.733
I hope that's okay, I...

31:42.067 --> 31:43.693
I didn't want to be alone.

31:46.822 --> 31:47.656
No.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.573
That's good.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.242
It's cool.

31:50.826 --> 31:51.660
It's good and cool.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.081
You were right about the view.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.582
It's pretty amazing.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.042
There's a leak.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.336
Oh, yeah. I noticed that too.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.507
You think it's serious?

32:06.800 --> 32:09.594
We're on the top floor.
It could be coming from the roof.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.017
Yes.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.270
It's Tony Caruso in room 301.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.939
We have a leak coming from our ceiling,
it looks pretty serious.

32:21.815 --> 32:22.774
Thank you.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.281
[sighs deeply] How did this happen?

32:30.574 --> 32:32.659
[sniffs] My sister...

32:32.993 --> 32:34.536
my support group, everyone...

32:34.828 --> 32:36.037
warned me not to come.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.749
But I had to have closure with Andre.

32:40.959 --> 32:41.793
Guess I got it.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.129
-[sniffs]
-Yeah.

32:45.755 --> 32:46.631
I guess you did.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.717
[Tony Jr. breathes deeply]

32:50.844 --> 32:52.762
Even my lawyer doesn't believe me.

32:55.348 --> 32:56.558
There's nobody but you.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.105
What am I gonna do?

33:04.733 --> 33:06.276
[exhales] You need a miracle.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.863
That's not much of a plan.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.240
I don't know.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.452
There's miracles every day.

33:25.545 --> 33:28.924
[Macy sobs and sniffs]

33:41.645 --> 33:42.938
What the hell is that?

33:47.567 --> 33:48.443
It's a drone.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.070
Where was it?

33:50.695 --> 33:51.947
On the roof, just above my room.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.115
I got a nephew
that likes to fly these things.

33:54.241 --> 33:55.492
Never seen one like this.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.703
Carbon fiber, multi-axle. This is no toy.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.247
Here's the camera.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.998
But what the hell is this thing?

34:02.791 --> 34:03.750
I'll be damned.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.961
That's a crossbow?

34:06.253 --> 34:07.796
So it can fire an arrow?

34:08.547 --> 34:10.048
-Most likely.
-Or a knife.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.093
Or a small knife like a stiletto.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.637
That explains the notch in the handle.

34:15.720 --> 34:16.638
Let me see that.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.643
Thank God, there's a leak in the ceiling.
We'd never have found this.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.062
It's still charged up.
We could take it out and test it.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.313
Sheriff.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.982
Excuse me. I'm on the same frequency.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.817
Something's still transmitting.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.944
[radio beeping]

34:56.845 --> 34:57.679
Three-fifteen.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.848
The guy with the necktie,
he's been at it all weekend.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.224
He won't put up much of a fight.

35:01.308 --> 35:04.144
-Who is he?
-Three-fifteen? Maury Peppitone.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.186
What?

35:05.312 --> 35:06.313
Do you know him?

35:06.396 --> 35:08.023
We do. He's a man with a motive.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.733
Get out of the way.

35:12.986 --> 35:13.820
Maury.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.531
It's Tony Caruso. Open the door, Maury.

35:36.968 --> 35:37.802
Clear.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.805
Nice view of the ski lift.

35:42.057 --> 35:42.891
There's a note.

[cameras clicking]

[Tony Sr. laughs]

36:25.975 --> 36:28.228
-Hey, excuse me. You're a reporter, right?
-Yeah.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.647
Alright, so let's make sure
we spell his name right.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.316
Caruso. C-A-R-U-S-O.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.526
He's my son.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.778
Yeah, we we're the only two
who believed her.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.905
[people chattering]

36:46.913 --> 36:48.915
[Tony Jr. whistling rythmically]

37:02.262 --> 37:03.096
My Uber's here.

37:05.807 --> 37:08.768
-I was going to drive you.
-No. You've done enough.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.021
I mean if you want to...

37:12.105 --> 37:13.815
take a later flight, I made breakfast.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.567
My sister is picking me up,

37:15.650 --> 37:17.694
so I'm kind of locked in.

37:17.777 --> 37:18.903
You understand, right?

37:19.112 --> 37:20.238
Yeah. Of course.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.490
I knew you would. You always do.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.908
That's what I love about you.

37:24.534 --> 37:25.493
Where's Papa Bear?

37:26.745 --> 37:27.746
He's running errands.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.790
Well, tell him I said goodbye.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.418
And... thanks for last night.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.172
-I mean for understanding.
-No.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.758
Like you said, you needed to...
clear your head.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.551
Were you okay on the couch?

37:42.302 --> 37:45.555
Oh, yeah. The couch and I are old friends.
[sighs]

37:46.931 --> 37:47.807
Well...

37:48.349 --> 37:50.101
next time we get together, let's...

37:50.268 --> 37:51.102
you know...

37:52.145 --> 37:52.979
get together.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.483
I would like that.
[both chuckle]

37:57.066 --> 37:58.610
[mobile phone ringing]

37:59.778 --> 38:00.612
Sorry.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.281
Hello?

38:03.740 --> 38:04.574
Lt. Caruso.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.202
This is Frank Moulton
from Bear Mountain Inn.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.621
We have a situation here.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.998
I'm sure you remember
that water leak you reported?

38:12.415 --> 38:14.918
<i>I'm afraid that we're going to have</i>
<i>to charge you for that repair.</i>

38:15.293 --> 38:16.127
What?

38:16.669 --> 38:17.504
Why?

38:17.712 --> 38:20.048
You know what?
Let me get right back to you.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.758
I'm saying goodbye to a friend.

38:24.344 --> 38:25.178
Who's that?

38:26.221 --> 38:28.348
It's the resort, something about the leak.

38:29.057 --> 38:29.891
Doesn't matter.

38:31.810 --> 38:32.644
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.021
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.068
Call me when you land.
Call me before you land.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.152
Call me...

38:41.236 --> 38:42.070
anytime.

38:42.153 --> 38:42.987
I will.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.240
Thanks again.

38:46.074 --> 38:46.908
You're the best.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.000
[receptionist]<i> Bear Mountain Inn.</i>

38:56.084 --> 38:56.918
Yes.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.838
-What were you saying?
<i>-About that leak...</i>

39:00.755 --> 39:02.340
<i>It wasn't coming from the roof.</i>

39:02.465 --> 39:04.217
We found a bag of ice in the vent.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.678
-[Tony Jr.]<i> A bag of ice?</i>
-Yes, sir, in the vent.

39:06.803 --> 39:09.430
Someone punctured a bag of ice
and stuck it up there.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.307
When it melted, it leaked.

39:11.599 --> 39:12.517
Everywhere.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.853
<i>You wouldn't know anything about this,</i>
<i>would you?</i>

39:14.936 --> 39:16.938
No, of course not. Why would anybody...

39:17.647 --> 39:20.024
Why would I put a bag of ice
in the ceiling?

39:20.525 --> 39:21.442
You know what?

39:22.026 --> 39:24.529
Just have the manager call me.
I'll discuss it with him.

39:24.612 --> 39:25.780
<i>Okay, yes, sir.</i>

39:36.708 --> 39:40.253
<i>It's very important to me.</i>
<i>I requested the top floor.</i>

39:43.464 --> 39:46.050
<i>Thank God there's a leak in the ceiling.</i>
<i>We'd never have found this.</i>

39:57.645 --> 39:58.771
I found your gun.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.067
[sighs] The water leak.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.029
My one mistake.
I didn't know what else to do.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.531
I had to get somebody up to the roof
to find the drone.

40:08.698 --> 40:09.782
Actually, you made...

40:10.366 --> 40:11.242
two mistakes.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.621
The battery in the drone was full.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.874
If it had really taken a flight,
gone up the mountain,

40:17.957 --> 40:19.626
it would've been... depleted.

40:22.295 --> 40:23.588
Well,  you live and you learn.

40:24.923 --> 40:25.757
Macy, just--

40:26.090 --> 40:28.092
[pulls the trigger and shoots the table]

40:30.261 --> 40:31.721
I know how to shoot, Tony.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.057
I date a lot of cops.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.267
I have a thing for cops.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.645
You have a thing for cops?
You killed two of them.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.480
I have a thing for cops.

40:42.148 --> 40:44.817
What choice did I have...

40:45.985 --> 40:47.820
after the way Andre treated me?

40:48.655 --> 40:50.365
You can't treat people like that.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.116
There are consequences.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.286
When did you kill Maury Peppitone?

40:56.371 --> 40:57.205
You tell me.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.042
Must have been Friday after we checked in.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.003
<i>You drugged him.</i>

41:12.220 --> 41:13.054
<i>You shot him.</i>

41:14.555 --> 41:15.974
<i>Made it look like a suicide.</i>

41:16.808 --> 41:19.644
He was your perfect fall guy.
Everybody knew he hated Rifkin.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.774
<i>And you planted evidence in the room.</i>

41:28.152 --> 41:28.987
<i>Some on the roof.</i>

41:33.491 --> 41:35.201
<i>Next day, on the ski lift,</i>
<i>you killed him.</i>

41:38.121 --> 41:39.706
<i>Just like everybody knew you did.</i>

41:42.875 --> 41:43.960
Everybody, but me.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.213
What about me? Was I...

41:48.131 --> 41:49.632
Was I just part of your plan?

41:50.008 --> 41:51.634
No.

41:51.968 --> 41:52.885
You...

41:53.428 --> 41:55.138
fell into my lap...

41:56.055 --> 41:57.223
like a Christmas gift.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.768
[moans] The earnest love-struck cowboy

42:00.852 --> 42:03.229
determined to restore
the lady's good name.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.108
Unfortunately,
you left your front door open,

42:07.191 --> 42:08.568
a junkie broke in, found your gun,

42:08.651 --> 42:10.028
and killed you in your dining room.

42:12.113 --> 42:14.073
[mobile phone ringing]

42:15.074 --> 42:17.076
[screams]

42:17.493 --> 42:20.121
[Tony and Macy grunting]

42:37.638 --> 42:38.473
[Macy] No.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.225
[Tony grunts and pants]

42:44.437 --> 42:45.938
You know, you were right, Macy.

42:46.272 --> 42:48.816
Life is an adventure or it's nothing.

42:49.192 --> 42:51.194
[Macy groaning]

42:54.155 --> 42:55.281
Oh, geez, I'm sorry.

42:55.364 --> 42:56.908
-I'll come back
-No, Dad, she's the one.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.159
She's the one.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.369
Jr., we've talked about this.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.581
You gotta tie the necktie to the doorknob.

43:03.831 --> 43:05.792
Don't worry, I got it.

43:05.875 --> 43:06.709
No, Dad.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.711
She's the one, Dad.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.299
She's the one. [laughs]
