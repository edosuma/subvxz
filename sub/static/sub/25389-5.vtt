THERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:02.870 --> 00:04.667
We're gonna sell
on the dark web.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.635
JAMES: Mail order cocaine?
TERESA: I have a guy.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.331
His name's Ivan.
He's built me a site.

00:09.370 --> 00:10.860
We're gonna ship
through a legitimate front

00:10.910 --> 00:12.309
and get paid with
cryptocurrency.

00:12.340 --> 00:14.035
We won't be cutting
into anyone's territory.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.638
JAMES: No, but we still need
to transport through it.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.409
Arizona's carved up
by five narcos.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.213
They're called La Comisin.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.842
There's a Mexican named Pecas.
He's the leader.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.418
(speaking Spanish)

00:24.450 --> 00:26.179
You're very light
on your feet, General.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.687
Very impressed.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.052
You're the one with the gifts,
mi jefa.

00:30.090 --> 00:32.024
Just how much access
do you think I have?

00:32.060 --> 00:34.494
I'm still on suspension.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.998
(sighs)
This is not a good idea.

00:37.030 --> 00:39.396
Here's a little piece
of Mexico to remember us by.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.192
-Ah!
TERESA: We need your help.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.832
As the business grows,
you can grow with it.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.531
POTE: We buying a winery?

00:44.570 --> 00:46.606
KELLY ANNE: This place has
an amazing wine cellar.

00:46.640 --> 00:47.937
We can put our production
down here.

00:47.980 --> 00:49.174
And we've set up
infrared cameras

00:49.210 --> 00:50.700
all around the property.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.877
And the entire system
is linked to your phone.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.718
-This is my wife Kelly Anne.
-Hi.

00:55.750 --> 00:57.581
POTE: Is the police
looking for you?

00:57.620 --> 00:59.679
Officially,
I am a missing person.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.278
And it's Priscilla now.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.083
JAMES: I was working
with Devon Finch.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.688
Someone hijacked
our shipment

01:04.730 --> 01:06.220
and Devon wanted him
taken out.

01:06.260 --> 01:08.194
Why take a chance?
Get it done.

01:08.230 --> 01:10.289
(struggling)

01:10.330 --> 01:11.365
(screams)

01:11.400 --> 01:13.197
(coughs)

01:13.240 --> 01:14.559
JAMES: You always said
there was a different way.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.409
I wanna do things differently.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.238
Let me in.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.976

"Queen Bitch" playing)

KELLY ANNE:
Welcome to Perla Blanca.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.617
We are fully committed
to offering our customers

01:26.650 --> 01:28.242

You know, she has
a thing for strays.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.414
Don't make her regret it.

03:20.630 --> 03:23.428
cutting out the middle man, and
turning product into champagne.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.189
TERESA: Yeah?
We did it.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.231
No, you did it.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.158
(romantic guitar music)

03:30.210 --> 03:34.328
Now that we have a team,
we can expand.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.872
Get big enough
where no one can hurt us.

03:37.910 --> 03:41.914
$30 million in a month
is a good start.

03:41.950 --> 03:43.781
You have your eyes

03:50.990 --> 03:53.129
I haven't had one
since we left Dallas.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.718
How about you?

03:54.760 --> 04:01.359
*

04:01.400 --> 04:04.631
I took flying lessons
when I was in Europe.

I'll be ready.

I'll be ready.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.113
You still don't trust me?

04:18.150 --> 04:19.754
You're still here.

That's something.

(laughter)

04:26.460 --> 04:27.825

04:27.860 --> 04:29.896
He's making it worse
than what I--

04:29.930 --> 04:31.261
It was not that bad at all.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.335
Oh, yeah.

04:32.370 --> 04:33.962
(door opens and closes)

04:37.340 --> 04:39.262
Good evening.

04:39.310 --> 04:41.904
I'd like to arrange dinner
reservations for my boss.

04:41.940 --> 04:45.444
We would love to accommodate
you, but we're closm'.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.141
Hmm.

Hands in the air.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.754
Don't move.
Don't move.

04:52.790 --> 04:56.419
Gun on the floor,
or your brains on the wall.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.758
Calm down.

Hello, Miss Mendoza.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.878
I hear the Sangiovese does

05:24.920 --> 05:26.319
Devon.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.850
DEVON: I've just
arrived in Phoenix.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.551
I have your manager
and I have your coke.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.285
TERESA (over phone):
She's not part of my business.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.527
Whatever the problem is,
we can fix it.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.198
DEVON: Join me for dinner
at your Winery.

05:36.230 --> 05:37.822
_This invitation
IS not optional.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.499
First course begins at eight.
Be here. Come alone.

(tense music)

06:01.420 --> 06:06.050
*

06:06.090 --> 06:08.320
Boaz has fled to Badiraguato.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.158
His cousin
Javier Jimenez is helping him.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.192
A wounded animal
always runs back home.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.231
CORTEZ: He's desperate.

06:16.270 --> 06:19.569
He sent a message
to his people.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.931
He's begging for a truce,

06:21.980 --> 06:24.073
for the sake of his son
and your daughter's union.

06:24.110 --> 06:27.216
Boaz tried to kill me.
There is no truce.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.787
Perhaps we can use Kique
to track him down.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.687
I cannot involve my future
son-in-law in this.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.756
That would destroy Isabela.

06:34.790 --> 06:36.758
We must find another way.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.621
You did good, General.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.594
We're nearly free of Boaz.

06:40.630 --> 06:44.862
But there is still
the matter of Teresa Mendoza.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.267
Has Agent Loya provided you
with any further assistance?

06:48.300 --> 06:52.134
He can only do so much until
the DEA reinstates him.

06:52.170 --> 06:55.879
According to my sources,
he has been reinstated.

06:55.910 --> 06:58.242
(ominous music)

06:58.280 --> 06:59.611
Recently?

06:59.650 --> 07:02.141
CORTEZ: Weeks ago.
And there's more.

07:02.180 --> 07:05.115
They say the DEA's target
is no longer Boaz.

07:05.150 --> 07:07.710
It's you.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.489
And you trust your sources?

07:09.530 --> 07:11.418
I trust no one.

07:11.460 --> 07:15.396
But, given your history
with Agent Loya,

07:15.430 --> 07:19.298
I suggest we err
on the side of caution.

07:19.330 --> 07:21.298
*

07:21.340 --> 07:24.002
Nobody touches Loya.

07:24.040 --> 07:28.170
Not until I look at him in the
eye and speak to him myself.

07:28.210 --> 07:29.905
Is that clear?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.440
*

07:31.480 --> 07:34.449
Como guste, Gobernadora.

JAMES: There's no service
in the cellar,

07:48.030 --> 07:49.292
but I'm sure Pote's safe.

07:49.330 --> 07:52.299
Someone was watching us.

07:52.330 --> 07:56.130
Or someone set us up.

07:56.170 --> 08:02.029
*

08:02.080 --> 08:03.775
LIL T: Any word from Pote
and the guys?

08:03.810 --> 08:05.675
Not yet. Listen we're gonna
need your help.

08:05.710 --> 08:08.543
Hey, when was the last time
you spoke to your uncle?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.343
We don't speak anymore.
What's your point?

08:10.390 --> 08:12.346
It's just a little convenient.

08:12.390 --> 08:13.982
Pote kills your
gangbanger buddies,

08:14.020 --> 08:16.113
you come work for us,
and now Devon finds us.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.525
You think I led him here?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.118
You know,
maybe it was your payback.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.957
Teresa got shot when your ass
switched out the coke.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.627
Don't talk
to me about loyalty.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.559
I lost my family
over this shit.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.137
I brought her here
because I trust her.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.831
Whatever you need me
to do I'll do,

08:29.870 --> 08:31.565
but if this pendejo
keeps stepping to me...

08:31.610 --> 08:34.636
He won't.
Be ready to move, okay?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.375
We're on our way to the winery.

08:36.410 --> 08:37.809
Shit, born ready.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.672
I'll call you.
Let's go.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.089
*

08:48.390 --> 08:52.554
Most domestic sparkling wine
is unremarkable.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.488
You knew enough
to find Teresa a winery

08:54.530 --> 08:57.260
that produces a supple
and elegant vintage.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.837
I salute you, Priscilla.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.895
Listen, I'm just
the manager here, okay?

09:01.940 --> 09:04.261
I promise
I don't know anything.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.709
You ran a wine club in Dallas?

09:05.740 --> 09:08.334
My former attorney,
Cole Van Awken,

09:08.380 --> 09:09.847
told me about your fine palate.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.007
It's a shame
what happened to him,

09:12.050 --> 09:13.847
isn't it, Kelly Anne?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.518
(menacing music)

09:15.550 --> 09:19.008
Take her downstairs.
Her time will come.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.950
All right, Hannah Montana,
let's go.

09:20.990 --> 09:23.959
Okay.

If Devon wanted our coke,

09:39.510 --> 09:40.909
he'd already be gone.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.305
Why is he here?

09:42.340 --> 09:44.046
Because he wants me.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.049
For not taking out
that guy in Texas for him.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.116
I'm gonna go in there
and work it out with him.

09:49.150 --> 09:52.449
You hurt his business.
There's no working that out.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.420
-I'm gonna go in.
-What're you doing?

09:58.460 --> 10:00.291
I'm not gonna let you
walk in there alone.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.888
Listen to me.
Go to La Comisin for backup.

10:01.930 --> 10:03.124
Have Ivan get something
on Devon

10:03.170 --> 10:04.819
that we can use
against him.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.237
Yeah, but he could hurt you
before that happens.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.659
He wants something else.
It's safer this way.

10:10.710 --> 10:14.669
Go to La Comisin.
I'll be okay.

10:14.710 --> 10:18.407
*

10:18.450 --> 10:21.442
KELLY ANNE: Ow (grunts).
VEE: Shut up.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.957
VEE: Sit down.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.309
(grunts)

10:29.360 --> 10:32.352
Tie her ass up.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.666
-Keep that bitch quiet.
-Mm-hmm.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.701
(grunts)

10:49.310 --> 10:51.005
(gasps)

10:51.050 --> 10:53.018
(shushes)
Just me, gabacha.

10:53.050 --> 10:54.472
Oh, thank God,
I thought they killed you.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.841
I was in here when they hit us.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.188
I'm gonna get us out of here.

10:59.220 --> 11:01.051
But I need your help.

11:01.090 --> 11:04.059
(suspenseful music)

11:04.090 --> 11:06.388
*

11:06.430 --> 11:09.058
Miss Mendoza.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.362
*

11:10.400 --> 11:13.699
DEVON: Perfect timing.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.709
Dinner is served.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.014
Where are my people?

11:27.050 --> 11:28.711
DEVON: Your security
is being held by mine,

11:28.750 --> 11:31.412
so that we may dine in peace.

11:31.450 --> 11:34.180
-And my manager?
-You mean Kelly Anne?

11:34.220 --> 11:37.656
She hasn't been harmed. Yet.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.157
What do you want from me?

11:39.190 --> 11:40.657
Direct as always.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.168
I want an introduction
to El Santo.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.758
(ominous music)

11:44.800 --> 11:47.064
I have no way
to contact him directly.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.761
Even ifI could,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.166
he only deals
with his followers.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.871
You weren't always
one of his followers.

11:52.910 --> 11:56.004
Yet you found your way
into his flock.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.600
I don't doubt your powers of
persuasion, Miss Mendoza.

11:58.650 --> 12:02.438
I can deliver you product,
but not him.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.687
We can make that deal.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.588
But you coming here like this,
it's not the man you are.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.350
(chuckles)
Evelyn.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.948
PROFESSOR:
(speaking Haitian Creole)

12:13.000 --> 12:14.058
_ DEVON:
(speaking Haitian Creole)

12:14.100 --> 12:15.590
She thinks she knows me.

12:15.630 --> 12:18.997
(speaking Haitian Creole)

12:20.500 --> 12:23.367
DEVON: Let me tell you
three things.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.561
Those days between
you and me are over.

12:26.610 --> 12:29.909
You have no clue who I am.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.817
Tonight you're gonna find out.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.408
*

12:34.450 --> 12:35.974
POTE: I'm gonna take him out.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.544
Then we run for the tunnel.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.818
Okay,
but there's a whole bunch

12:38.850 --> 12:40.078
more guards
all over the winery.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.123
They got guns,
and, like, radios.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.094
-Now you have one.
-I don't--

12:48.130 --> 12:50.621
POTE: When they come for us,
you let 'em have it.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.262
I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.961
I cleaned up
your husband.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.558
I know you can shoot.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.261
That was different.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.505
You were in danger then,
you're in danger now.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.304
We're like sitting ducks
in here.

13:02.340 --> 13:04.672
(foreboding music)

13:04.710 --> 13:08.009
I need your help.

13:08.050 --> 13:09.642
Are you with me?

13:09.680 --> 13:12.444
Or not?

13:12.490 --> 13:15.459
(gasps)

13:15.490 --> 13:16.616
(chuckles)

13:16.660 --> 13:18.321
Andale, gabacha.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.193
(exhales) Okay.

13:21.230 --> 13:24.199
(traditional Mexican music)

13:24.230 --> 13:27.336
JAMES: I thought I was meeting
with the full Comisin.

13:27.370 --> 13:29.691
PECAS: We don't throw up
the Bat-Signal

13:29.740 --> 13:33.005
every time you get
yourself into trouble.

13:33.040 --> 13:37.306
They authorized me to hear
you out on their behalf.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.806
So...

13:38.850 --> 13:41.648
What did you do
to bring Devon Finch down here?

13:41.680 --> 13:43.386
We're not clear
on that just yet.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.548
Then I'm not sure
I can help you.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.217
What's the point
of having a Comisin

13:48.260 --> 13:50.182
if an outsider can come in
and do what he wants?

13:50.230 --> 13:53.051
Since you arrived,
all we've seen is chaos.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.455
You think the other members
are eager to go to war

13:55.500 --> 13:57.127
with a Chicago gangster
on your behalf?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.821
We backed off the Sheriff
on your behalf.

13:59.870 --> 14:03.465
You're making money from us.
Now you just wanna screw us?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.034
It's not my call.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.174
I--I'|| talk to the rest
of La Comisin.

14:07.210 --> 14:09.303
But in the meantime,

14:09.340 --> 14:12.400
see if you can't work
this out yourselves first.

14:12.450 --> 14:14.543
*

14:14.580 --> 14:16.639
I'll remember this.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.649
PECAS: Okay.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.009
*

14:21.060 --> 14:22.652
(mimicking)
I'll remember this.

14:22.690 --> 14:26.319
(chuckles)
(speaks Spanish)

14:26.360 --> 14:28.419
(cell phone vibrating)

14:32.130 --> 14:35.338
DEVON: Give me the phone.

14:35.370 --> 14:36.906
Don't make me ask twice.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.909
(tense music)

14:39.940 --> 14:44.775
*

14:44.810 --> 14:46.949
Hey, my old friend.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.743
I'm here with Teresa.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.748
DEVON (over phone): We just
started our second course.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.452
Look, whatever this is,
whatever game you're playing--

14:53.490 --> 14:55.185
Did you really think you
weren't gonna see me again?

14:55.220 --> 14:56.881
That's got nothing
to do with Teresa.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.125
It does now.
So why don't you come in here,

14:59.160 --> 15:00.798
meet me face to face?

15:00.830 --> 15:02.752
JAMES (over phone):
Just know, if you hurt her--

15:02.800 --> 15:07.260
*

15:07.300 --> 15:09.063
You came here for revenge.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.534
From James, yes.

15:11.570 --> 15:15.074
From you,
I told you what I want.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.704
If you hurt me,

15:17.750 --> 15:20.913
you won't need
to look for El Santo.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.542
He'll find you.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.912
One last chance,
Miss Mendoza.

15:24.950 --> 15:27.953
I want a line to your supplier.

15:27.990 --> 15:30.129
*

15:30.160 --> 15:31.457
Bring me her friend.

15:31.490 --> 15:34.152
Wait.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.760
He gave me a number
for emergencies only.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.791
I have it memorized.

15:38.830 --> 15:40.639
*

15:40.670 --> 15:42.638
You and the numbers.

15:42.670 --> 15:49.678
*

15:54.120 --> 16:00.218
*

16:06.790 --> 16:08.792
Everything okay?

16:15.700 --> 16:18.703
What's on your mind?

16:20.810 --> 16:23.802
I understood the rules
when we started this.

16:25.850 --> 16:28.944
We had common goals

16:28.980 --> 16:31.983
and the exchange of information
helped us both.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.528
The rest of it

16:39.560 --> 16:41.949
was

16:42.000 --> 16:44.798
unexpected.

16:44.830 --> 16:47.560
Lovely.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.761
It has been.

16:53.340 --> 16:56.332
I know the DEA reinstated you.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.342
And I know their goal
is no longer Boaz, but me.

17:06.550 --> 17:09.553
You think I lied to you?

17:11.230 --> 17:14.757
I don't wanna believe that.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.768
I don't know who's been
telling you these things.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.099
But I'd ask you
what they have to gain.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.108
I saved your life
when I didn't know you.

17:25.140 --> 17:27.370
You think I'd set you up
now that I do?

17:27.410 --> 17:29.878
We've been at war, Camila.

17:29.910 --> 17:32.902
But in this thing here,

17:34.580 --> 17:37.219
I'm with you.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.781
Say it again.

17:44.660 --> 17:47.390
I'm with you.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.369
(ominous music)

17:56.400 --> 18:03.408
*

18:04.180 --> 18:07.638
(breathing heavily)

18:07.680 --> 18:14.688
*

18:28.100 --> 18:31.069
(heavy breathing and kissing
through headphones)

18:31.110 --> 18:38.107
*

18:42.550 --> 18:45.280
TERESA: Are you Haitian?

18:45.320 --> 18:46.912
Excuse me?

18:46.950 --> 18:48.759
You sound like you're Haitian.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.122
PROFESSOR: Ah.

18:52.790 --> 18:56.624
If I were you,
I'd mind my own damn business.

19:01.870 --> 19:04.805
(tense music)

19:04.840 --> 19:06.262
*

19:06.310 --> 19:08.005
Are you seeing this?

19:08.040 --> 19:09.371
JAMES: She's telling us
something.

19:09.410 --> 19:10.946
That woman.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.107
-Do a search on her.
-On it.

19:13.150 --> 19:14.777
JAMES (over phone): Whatever
you get, send it to Lil T,

19:14.820 --> 19:15.844
ASAP.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.144
Done.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.181
*

19:20.220 --> 19:21.949
That number you gave us

19:21.990 --> 19:24.151
tracks to a pay phone
on the coast of Ecuador.

19:24.190 --> 19:26.522
El Santo has
followers everywhere.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.721
-It must be a drop phone.
DEVON: That's bullshit.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.864
And you're just buying time.

19:30.900 --> 19:34.358
Bring me her friend.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.039
*

19:37.070 --> 19:40.198
KELLY ANNE: Ah!

19:40.240 --> 19:43.539
(screams)

19:43.580 --> 19:46.970
MAN: You need to be quiet.
(grunts)

19:47.010 --> 19:49.979
POTE: Let's go.
-Okay.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.318
(suspenseful music)

19:52.350 --> 19:54.079
*

19:54.120 --> 19:55.712
You have the keys
to the tunnel?

19:55.760 --> 19:57.819
The guards took 'em.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.179
Stay there.
Cover me.

19:59.230 --> 20:02.199
Okay.

20:02.230 --> 20:09.033
*

20:17.250 --> 20:19.275
(grunts)

20:19.310 --> 20:21.847
MAN: Oh!

20:21.880 --> 20:24.212
*

20:24.250 --> 20:26.889
(grunts)

20:26.920 --> 20:28.410
VEE: Get your ass out here.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.451
KELLY ANNE: Don't shoot.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.923
I don't ha--I don't have a gun.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.054
Get down on your knees now.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.069
Okay.

20:38.100 --> 20:44.767
*

20:53.250 --> 20:56.276
(cellar door
creaks open and shut)

21:01.420 --> 21:06.380
*

21:06.430 --> 21:08.648
DEVON: I'm gonna ask you
once, nicely.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.669
How does Teresa get
in contact with El Santo?

21:11.700 --> 21:12.667
*

21:12.700 --> 21:14.258
I don't know.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.235
She doesn't.
Let her go.

21:17.270 --> 21:19.761
I have a better idea.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.607
Let's go swimming.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.768
What?

21:24.810 --> 21:26.971
*

21:27.010 --> 21:28.614
What does he mean "swimming"?

21:28.650 --> 21:30.481
-Put her on the board.
-What does he--

21:30.520 --> 21:33.284
No, no, no, no.
(whimpers)

21:33.320 --> 21:34.856
-What--
TERESA: N0.

21:34.890 --> 21:38.485
DEVON: Give me El Santo
and I'll let her go.

21:38.530 --> 21:41.454
(rustling)

21:41.500 --> 21:48.497
*

21:53.710 --> 21:57.703
I got out through the tunnel.
But they got Kelly Anne.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.502
-We gotta go back in.
-No, we're outnumbered.

21:59.550 --> 22:01.973
We rush in now, they kill
Teresa and Kelly Anne.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.284
-Where's Tonto and Charger?
-I don't know.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.289
But we gotta do something.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.481
*

22:09.520 --> 22:11.852
(grunts) What're you--
what're you doing?

22:11.890 --> 22:13.391
Teresa!

22:13.430 --> 22:15.352
TERESA:
She doesn't know anything.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.188
Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

22:19.230 --> 22:21.369
KELLY ANNE: (coughs)

22:21.400 --> 22:25.029
TERESA: Listen to me,
don't do this.

22:25.070 --> 22:27.630
Stop it, you're gonna kill her.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.307
Just let her go.

22:29.340 --> 22:31.672
I'll give you
anything you want.

22:31.710 --> 22:33.246
(coughing, gargling)

22:33.280 --> 22:36.477
Come on.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.545
(door opens)

22:38.590 --> 22:41.809
KELLY ANNE:
(coughing, gargling)

22:41.860 --> 22:43.828
(gasping)

22:45.790 --> 22:51.626
*

22:55.070 --> 22:57.800
*

23:11.620 --> 23:14.589
(ominous music)

23:14.620 --> 23:17.384
*

23:17.430 --> 23:20.490
CORTEZ: (speaking Spanish)

23:27.270 --> 23:34.278
*

23:36.480 --> 23:37.902
Come here.

23:37.950 --> 23:44.947
*

23:52.030 --> 23:54.419
There's a camera
in the motion detector.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.621
(snorts)

23:56.660 --> 23:59.220
LOYA: I know what you're doing.

23:59.270 --> 24:02.137
And I know who's behind it.

24:02.170 --> 24:09.133
*

24:09.180 --> 24:12.149
Last year Cortez
tried to kill you.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.841
*

24:13.880 --> 24:18.089
And I saved your life.

24:18.120 --> 24:21.157
So who are you gonna believe?

24:21.190 --> 24:28.198
*

24:33.500 --> 24:37.095
Take the side door.

24:37.140 --> 24:41.008
LOYA: Get out of here.

24:41.040 --> 24:48.048
*

24:52.490 --> 24:55.459
CORTEZ: (speaking Spanish)

24:55.490 --> 24:58.459
(tense music)

24:58.490 --> 25:00.993
*

25:01.030 --> 25:03.692
(grunting)

25:03.730 --> 25:09.930
*

25:12.240 --> 25:15.869
(grunts)

25:15.910 --> 25:22.918
*

25:24.750 --> 25:28.015
(speaking Spanish)

25:28.060 --> 25:30.881
*

25:30.930 --> 25:33.057
(speaking Spanish)

25:38.730 --> 25:41.164
DEVON: Then we have a deal.
JAMES: I'm good with that.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.033
Let me tell her.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.708
Devon's leaving.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.833
He's let Kelly Anne go,
and you can go too.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.029
And he's gonna back off
your business.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.002
What does he get in return?

25:51.050 --> 25:53.678
He's leaving with me so we can
settle our unfinished business.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.369
No.

25:55.420 --> 25:58.241
DEVON: Last year, this man
showed loyalty to Camila

25:58.290 --> 25:59.780
and nearly got you killed.

25:59.820 --> 26:01.788
You're willing
to sacrifice everything,

26:01.820 --> 26:05.085
including your life,
for this man?

26:05.130 --> 26:08.520
Yes.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.528
Has he told you about

26:10.560 --> 26:13.358
his little excursion
With us in Texas?

26:13.400 --> 26:15.630
He spared the man
you wanted to kill.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.035
(chuckles)

26:17.070 --> 26:20.403
Oh, she doesn't know.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.635
Well, allow me
to open your eyes.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.375
Or better yet,
let's have the man

26:24.410 --> 26:28.642
that you're willing to trade
your life for do it for you.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.379
Devon sent me
to take out a man who had

26:34.420 --> 26:37.628
hijacked one of his shipments.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.423
You told me.

26:41.930 --> 26:43.818
(ominous music)

26:43.870 --> 26:45.599
(grunting)

26:45.630 --> 26:47.632
*

26:47.670 --> 26:50.639
(coughing)

26:50.670 --> 26:57.473
*

26:57.510 --> 26:59.603
Mark?
No.

26:59.650 --> 27:02.346
(screaming)

27:04.190 --> 27:06.249
(neck snaps)

27:06.290 --> 27:08.758
SUZIE: Mommy, what was that?
What's happening?

27:08.790 --> 27:10.519
We caught someone
trying to break in.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.084
I need you to go next door
to the neighbors.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.927
Go, go, go.

27:13.960 --> 27:20.524
*

27:24.970 --> 27:28.371
SUZIE: Mommy, mommy.

27:28.410 --> 27:31.846
(e No!
xplosion)

27:31.880 --> 27:33.472
DEVON: The man he took out

27:33.510 --> 27:35.148
was part of a crew that
stole a shipment from me.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.171
James was supposed
to take those men out,

27:37.220 --> 27:38.949
make it look like a robbery.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.380
Instead, he turned
the first one into a bloodbath,

27:42.420 --> 27:44.354
where a little girl died.

27:44.390 --> 27:45.880
Then grew a conscience
and decided to walk away

27:45.930 --> 27:47.329
from the rest of the job.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.966
I'm taking this piece of shit.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.797
What you must decide,
Miss Mendoza,

27:52.830 --> 27:55.492
now that you know
everything about him,

27:55.540 --> 27:57.906
is are you willing
to sacrifice your life

27:57.940 --> 28:00.909
in a futile attempt
to prevent that?

28:00.940 --> 28:02.908
*

28:02.940 --> 28:06.398
Take him.

28:06.450 --> 28:08.918
*

28:14.760 --> 28:17.149
(tense music)

28:17.190 --> 28:23.095
*

28:38.250 --> 28:39.740
(grunting)

28:39.780 --> 28:41.748
(gunshots)

28:41.780 --> 28:43.748
*

28:43.790 --> 28:45.280
Mano a mano.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.685
I'm gonna like this.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.779
Just like you like
watching me and Camila?

28:48.820 --> 28:51.050
(grunts)

28:51.090 --> 28:58.064
*

28:58.100 --> 29:00.694
(screams)
(grunts)

29:00.730 --> 29:06.760
*

29:16.750 --> 29:19.548
Camila and I will rule Mexico.

29:19.590 --> 29:23.378
And there's no room
for a little boy.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.819
*

29:24.860 --> 29:27.158
(grunts)

29:27.190 --> 29:29.329
(gasping)

29:31.370 --> 29:33.838
Better her boy than her dog.

29:38.270 --> 29:41.239
(foreboding music)

29:41.280 --> 29:48.277
*

30:04.000 --> 30:06.764
*

30:06.800 --> 30:09.360
Eh, cabrn.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.402
(hisses)

30:13.410 --> 30:19.804
*

30:20.810 --> 30:22.368
Listen.

30:22.420 --> 30:23.887
I'm not gonna let him take you.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.046
But you just said--

30:25.090 --> 30:27.513
I said that to buy us time.

30:27.550 --> 30:29.051
VEE: There's someone
on the outer grounds.

30:29.090 --> 30:30.887
Armed. Coming this way.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.728
Check it out.
Collect the men.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.899
-Okay.
-Get the car ready.

30:35.930 --> 30:38.160
The cabinet behind me.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.636
With the guns?
There's too many of them.

30:41.670 --> 30:43.558
JAMES: We won't make it.
-Then we don't make it.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.363
(Jacob Banks'
"Unholy War" playing)

30:45.410 --> 30:48.470
*

30:48.510 --> 30:53.072
* Unholy war

30:53.110 --> 30:57.570
* My demons are coming

30:57.620 --> 31:01.852
* Boy, you better run

31:01.890 --> 31:05.656
* Go take your freedom,
oh no *

31:05.690 --> 31:08.693
* Wade in the water

31:08.730 --> 31:12.894
* Be gone by morning

31:12.930 --> 31:14.739
* Don't you let them
find you here *

31:14.770 --> 31:17.432
What you wanna do, son?

31:17.470 --> 31:20.405
VEE: Put the gun down
before it gets ugly.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.533
*

31:22.580 --> 31:24.502
* Let love lead you home

31:24.550 --> 31:27.075

31:27.110 --> 31:29.374

31:29.420 --> 31:33.379
* Let redemption
keep you warm *

31:33.420 --> 31:34.580
*

31:34.620 --> 31:35.882
* So, you better--

31:35.920 --> 31:37.387
Stop.

31:37.420 --> 31:40.287
(gospel music
playing on cell phone)

31:40.330 --> 31:44.096
* Looks like the band
that Moses led *

31:44.130 --> 31:46.428
You're gonna wanna see this.

31:46.470 --> 31:50.566

trouble the water *

31:50.600 --> 31:54.878

trouble the water *

ooh, ooh, ooh *

32:18.330 --> 32:20.594
How did you find her?

32:20.630 --> 32:22.291
*

32:22.340 --> 32:26.106
How the hell did you
find my mother?

32:26.140 --> 32:28.301
You're invisible online.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.934
But your sister's not.

32:30.980 --> 32:33.676
I should kill you.

32:33.710 --> 32:35.746
You saw your mother.

32:35.780 --> 32:38.419
Phone, please.

32:38.450 --> 32:40.918
*

32:40.950 --> 32:42.815
ALL: * Ooh, ooh, ooh

32:42.860 --> 32:45.021
-Any problems?
LIL T (over phone): No.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.652
Who knew that delivery truck
could go 150

32:46.690 --> 32:48.021
on the highway, though.

32:48.060 --> 32:51.097
LIL T:
That hacker dude's the shit.

32:51.130 --> 32:52.995
So what you gonna
need me to do?

32:53.030 --> 32:56.329
Wait for me
to call you back in a few.

32:56.370 --> 32:58.099
Devon's just leaving.

32:58.140 --> 33:01.974
* Whoa, ooh, wade

33:02.010 --> 33:03.875
ALL: * Wade in the water

33:03.910 --> 33:07.277

wade *

trouble the water *

33:20.430 --> 33:23.058
(door opens and closes)

33:25.600 --> 33:27.864
I have news.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.460
Not sure if it's good or bad,
but...

33:30.500 --> 33:32.502
He got away.

33:32.540 --> 33:35.532
I_d_o not recall
authorizmg an audience.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.901
You let him escape.

33:37.940 --> 33:41.000
You failed me, General.

33:41.050 --> 33:44.679
CORTEZ: The cameras
were for your protection.

33:46.250 --> 33:49.481
I apologize.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.887
Hearing you speak to him the
way you did in that hotel, I...

33:52.930 --> 33:56.058
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.263
_ It was all
information and sex.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.359
That's all it was with him.

34:03.540 --> 34:05.701
Lately,

34:05.740 --> 34:09.232
nothing seems
to make me happy.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.602
(ominous music)

34:12.650 --> 34:15.710
Well, I think I have something
that may change that for you.

34:15.750 --> 34:19.186
In an unexpected offer
from a friend.

34:19.220 --> 34:23.008
Something I think
you'll like very much.

34:23.060 --> 34:28.748
*

34:28.800 --> 34:31.724
LIN: We ran the phone number
Mendoza supplied again.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.238
Problem's that El Santo's
people change them

34:34.270 --> 34:37.398
so frequently that
this is one burnt now.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.137
So she really did give up
her supplier for that bastard.

34:41.180 --> 34:44.104
Loyalty to a fault.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.300
Can't be bought either.

34:46.350 --> 34:48.818
Told the brass I saw firsthand

34:48.850 --> 34:50.909
you'd gone above and beyond
to get us that intel.

34:50.950 --> 34:52.212
She found leverage on the fly

34:52.250 --> 34:54.252
and backed me off
without a gun.

34:54.290 --> 34:57.453
-I underestimated her.
-We all did, Devante.

34:57.490 --> 34:59.822
We'll tighten things up
on our end.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.896
Relocate your mother,
and our cyber team

35:01.930 --> 35:03.454
will make sure your
sister and family

35:03.500 --> 35:05.718
_ have no further
internet presence.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.988
Where do they want me?

35:08.030 --> 35:09.588
Chief of Station
wants you back

35:09.640 --> 35:11.505
at your aviation business
in Chicago.

35:11.540 --> 35:14.634
El Santo remains a priority
target for the agency.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.274
(percussive music)

35:17.310 --> 35:19.175
We'll find another way at 'em.

35:19.210 --> 35:21.007
*

35:21.050 --> 35:23.518
I might already have one.

35:23.550 --> 35:27.316
This might hurt.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.352
KELLY ANNE: (hisses)

35:29.390 --> 35:32.518
Yeah.

35:32.560 --> 35:36.052
(refrigerator door opens)

35:39.530 --> 35:41.498
You're good?

35:41.540 --> 35:44.304
Yeah.

35:44.340 --> 35:46.205
TERESA: Listen.

35:46.240 --> 35:50.472
If you want to leave,
I'll help set you up

35:50.510 --> 35:52.944
anywhere you want
to go, okay?

35:52.980 --> 35:55.972
I wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for you.

35:57.550 --> 35:59.643
I'm not going anywhere.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.411
Okay.

36:05.490 --> 36:08.288
POTE: Andale, gabacha.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.321
I'll check on dinner.

36:12.900 --> 36:15.698
KELLY ANNE: I fired that gun
like it was nothing.

36:15.740 --> 36:19.232
I hit that guard.

36:19.270 --> 36:22.569
I wasn't even thinking twice
ifI killed him.

36:22.610 --> 36:24.339
(ominous music)

36:24.380 --> 36:28.874
Shooting Cole, I knew
who I was and what I was doing.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.889
And it killed me.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.740
*

36:33.790 --> 36:38.159
But I'm scared because today
I don't feel a thing.

36:38.190 --> 36:39.680
*

36:39.730 --> 36:42.494
Your husband beat you.

36:42.530 --> 36:44.566
The men you shot at

36:44.600 --> 36:46.761
wanted to kill us.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.439
It is all right to feel nothing
for hurting the people

36:49.470 --> 36:51.836
that want to destroy you.

36:51.870 --> 36:54.930
You saved my life.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.437
You're family now.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.199
*

37:00.250 --> 37:03.219
Thank you.
(sniffles)

37:03.250 --> 37:10.258

37:11.330 --> 37:13.855
Let's eat.

37:13.890 --> 37:17.257
Okay.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.518
Oh, my God,
that smells amazing.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.367
Pollo la crema.

37:21.400 --> 37:25.439
The chicken's gonna taste
like it was born in the sauce.

37:25.470 --> 37:26.937
KELLY ANNE: (giggles)

37:26.970 --> 37:29.575
(blowing)

37:29.610 --> 37:31.646
Come on, prueba.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.602
*

37:33.650 --> 37:35.618
-Oh, my gosh.
-(chuckles)

37:35.650 --> 37:38.915
-(grunts)
-Hand me your plate.

37:38.950 --> 37:43.956
*

37:51.770 --> 37:54.762
House is yours now.
I'm gonna leave.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.461
No.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.934
Look, I'm no good for you here.
I mean, you could've lost

37:58.970 --> 38:01.768
everything,
including your life.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.675
And I lied to you,
right to your face.

38:03.710 --> 38:06.838
Yes.
And I know why you did.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.180
Her name was Suzie.

38:15.220 --> 38:18.257
She couldn't have been more
than, like, six years old.

38:18.290 --> 38:21.179
(somber music)

38:21.230 --> 38:25.189
I can't stop
thinking about her.

38:25.230 --> 38:27.960
You didn't mean
for that to happen.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.039
*

38:32.070 --> 38:36.029
You once told me_ there's no
good or bad in this busmess.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.138
*

38:37.180 --> 38:39.148
Right?

38:39.180 --> 38:41.205
*

38:41.250 --> 38:44.219
I'm not sure
I believe that anymore.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.115
*

38:46.150 --> 38:47.879
Because of that little girl?

38:47.920 --> 38:50.150
Her.

38:50.190 --> 38:51.521
*

38:51.560 --> 38:53.824
And you.

38:53.860 --> 38:57.227
Listen.

38:57.260 --> 38:59.319
Whatever you've done,

38:59.370 --> 39:02.828
you don't need to hide from me.

39:02.870 --> 39:04.462
*

39:04.510 --> 39:07.468
We're in this together.

39:07.510 --> 39:13.005
*

39:13.050 --> 39:16.144
I don't deserve that.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.647
*

39:17.680 --> 39:20.217
Everyone deserves that.

39:20.250 --> 39:23.219
(Elastic Bond's
"Corazn" plays)

39:23.260 --> 39:26.229
(singing in Spanish)

39:26.260 --> 39:33.268
*

39:48.820 --> 39:55.817
*

40:09.140 --> 40:16.137
*

40:27.020 --> 40:33.255
*

40:33.290 --> 40:40.298
*

40:43.270 --> 40:46.239
(car rumbling, beeping)

40:46.270 --> 40:51.549
*

41:06.030 --> 41:09.158
(two gunshots)

41:11.200 --> 41:13.521
(menacing music)

41:13.570 --> 41:20.339
*

41:21.840 --> 41:23.535
MAN: Andale, pues.

41:23.580 --> 41:28.301
*

41:28.350 --> 41:31.319
Let's go.
Let's get on with it.

41:31.350 --> 41:38.313
*

41:43.430 --> 41:48.424
*
