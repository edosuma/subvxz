00:00.414 --> 00:03.328
Matt, have you seen my earbuds?

00:03.414 --> 00:04.948
Yeah, it's open.

00:05.016 --> 00:07.578
Hey, have you seen my earbuds?
Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:07.617 --> 00:09.216
No worries, man. What's up?

00:09.284 --> 00:11.986
Um, I was just wondering
if you'd seen my earbuds.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.888
Oh, yeah. Sorry, man.

00:13.956 --> 00:16.256
I borrowed them for a run.

00:16.325 --> 00:19.059
Thank you. Thanks. Um...

00:19.128 --> 00:20.728
Okay, all right, I gotta go.

00:20.796 --> 00:22.997
Sure you can't stay and hang?

00:23.065 --> 00:24.965
Oh, my God. Um...

00:25.034 --> 00:28.902
I'd love to. I'd love to hang.

00:28.970 --> 00:32.305
I just can't right now
'cause I'm in a play,

00:32.374 --> 00:34.674
and they can't do it without me.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.777
I'm kind of the...
I'm the titular role, so...

00:37.846 --> 00:40.947
Oh, that's cool, man. What's it called?

00:41.016 --> 00:43.250
"While John Slept".

00:43.318 --> 00:45.285
What do you mean? He's our brother.

00:45.354 --> 00:48.355
Keep your voice down.
He's been through enough.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.957
He has a right to know.

00:51.026 --> 00:53.160
- We have to protect him.
- Love you.

00:53.228 --> 00:55.662
That's what family does.

00:55.730 --> 00:59.933
So it's settled. We decide tomorrow.

01:00.001 --> 01:02.001
Agreed. Brian?

01:02.071 --> 01:04.337
- No.
- No?

01:04.406 --> 01:06.573
You think I want to say no?

01:06.641 --> 01:08.307
Like some kind of sick freak?

01:08.376 --> 01:11.210
- Of course not, but...
- But nothing!

01:11.279 --> 01:13.613
Did he talk? Did I miss it?

01:13.682 --> 01:15.582
He's just been sleeping.

01:15.650 --> 01:18.851
We decide the day after tomorrow.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.920
I just think they should give him lines.

01:20.989 --> 01:23.089
- Yes. It is.
- He's so great with lines.

01:23.157 --> 01:25.458
- Yes. Yes.
- Don't you think so, Brookie?

01:27.228 --> 01:30.830
- The day after.
- Yes.

01:32.934 --> 01:34.734
You were amazing, Cary.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.335
You were asleep the whole time.

01:36.404 --> 01:38.037
- So were you.
- It's fine.

01:38.106 --> 01:39.839
Sleeping through plays
is classic Brooke.

01:39.908 --> 01:42.842
No, it's not. I just didn't
get any sleep last night.

01:42.911 --> 01:45.311
I crashed at a friend's place
who just had a baby.

01:45.379 --> 01:46.813
Why do people do that?

01:46.881 --> 01:48.614
Well, you can always
crash with me and Chase.

01:48.682 --> 01:49.982
Fuck no!

01:50.050 --> 01:51.516
I mean, no thank you.

01:51.585 --> 01:52.818
Well, Cary, I thought
you were incredible.

01:52.886 --> 01:54.419
I really believed you were sleeping.

01:54.488 --> 01:56.521
Thanks, but that big
monologue at the top

01:56.590 --> 01:58.423
is why I took the part,
so casting directors

01:58.492 --> 01:59.725
could see my range.

01:59.793 --> 02:01.693
Oh, no, we were five minutes late.

02:01.762 --> 02:03.061
- You talked?
- Mom.

02:03.130 --> 02:05.063
I'm sorry, the building
looked abandoned.

02:05.132 --> 02:07.165
We thought we were in
the wrong place, Cary.

02:07.234 --> 02:09.067
Yeah, that is really
hurting our attendance.

02:09.136 --> 02:10.535
Sometimes people don't even come

02:10.604 --> 02:12.403
to our night shows, and we just leave.

02:12.472 --> 02:14.405
Well, I'm gonna come back
and see your speech.

02:14.474 --> 02:16.541
I'm gonna do a lot of things
now that I live here.

02:16.610 --> 02:18.576
This is gonna be my year of yes.

02:18.646 --> 02:20.045
Okay, you don't live here now, Mom.

02:20.114 --> 02:21.379
You're just here for a couple of months.

02:21.448 --> 02:22.780
It's very important to my sanity

02:22.849 --> 02:24.382
that you make that distinction.

02:24.451 --> 02:26.151
Oh, kiss my butt.

02:26.219 --> 02:29.654
What? I'm a New Yorker now!

02:29.708 --> 02:30.725
Hey!

02:32.959 --> 02:37.094
Here we are, home sweet home!

02:37.164 --> 02:39.030
- Whoa.
- Can you believe it?

02:39.098 --> 02:42.133
Wait, is this
Justin Theroux's apartment?

02:42.202 --> 02:43.701
Yes. How did you know?

02:43.770 --> 02:46.137
Uh, 'cause I'm looking
at a huge photo of him.

02:46.206 --> 02:47.738
So I hope it is.

02:47.807 --> 02:49.541
I know it's not as cozy as back home,

02:49.609 --> 02:51.209
but I did get to hang a few things

02:51.278 --> 02:53.010
to kind of warm it up.

02:53.079 --> 02:55.513
Yes, okay, now it feels like Ohio.

02:55.582 --> 02:57.649
How are you guys living here?

02:57.717 --> 03:00.985
Well, Justin's out of town,
and Streeter represents him.

03:01.054 --> 03:03.019
- He does?
- Yeah, for music.

03:03.088 --> 03:04.788
Oh, which reminds me,
Streeter's coming by

03:04.856 --> 03:06.256
in a second with someone from the label.

03:06.325 --> 03:08.158
The grind never stops.

03:08.227 --> 03:09.926
Okay.

03:09.995 --> 03:12.496
Well, if you need us,
we are going to be looking

03:12.565 --> 03:14.731
through every drawer in this house.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.533
Yes, each and every one.

03:23.342 --> 03:24.774
It's good.

03:24.843 --> 03:26.743
Wait, so he just kept jerking off?

03:26.812 --> 03:29.145
Yeah, and staring directly into my eyes.

03:29.215 --> 03:30.914
Would a straight guy do that?

03:30.982 --> 03:33.083
Oh, God, Cary, as much as
you want this to be real,

03:33.151 --> 03:35.051
you and Matt are not a thing.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.820
I mean, you haven't even hung
out outside of the apartment.

03:36.888 --> 03:38.522
Yes, we have.

03:38.591 --> 03:41.592
We arrive home at the same
moment all of the time.

03:41.660 --> 03:43.960
Okay, you need to see a therapist.

03:44.029 --> 03:46.329
- You do too.
- Well, I already do.

03:46.397 --> 03:47.831
She's my barista, but she really helps.

03:47.899 --> 03:49.298
I'm just gonna ask Matt out on a date.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.300
He's clearly getting
more comfortable with me.

03:51.369 --> 03:54.337
If we can just hang out
in public together,

03:54.405 --> 03:56.005
he'll see that he can do this.

03:56.074 --> 03:57.440
Oh, Debra.

03:57.508 --> 04:00.543
Wanna get a drink tonight?

04:00.612 --> 04:02.645
Send.

04:02.714 --> 04:04.180
Holy shit.

04:04.249 --> 04:06.182
Why does Justin Theroux
have a room in his house

04:06.251 --> 04:08.417
that just has a motorcycle
and a sink in it?

04:09.988 --> 04:12.521
This is a toilet.

04:12.590 --> 04:13.990
Color palette's very important as well.

04:14.059 --> 04:15.424
- Yes.
- Well, hey, hey, hey.

04:15.493 --> 04:17.160
Brooke. Gay brother.

04:17.228 --> 04:19.762
Shuli Kucerac. Chase's
publicist from the label.

04:19.831 --> 04:21.497
Sorry to barge in while you're settling,

04:21.565 --> 04:23.767
but we have an important
PR opportunity to discuss.

04:23.835 --> 04:25.334
- It was my idea.
- Yeah.

04:25.403 --> 04:27.536
And it's for tonight,
so we have no time to waste.

04:27.605 --> 04:28.771
I thought of it.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.172
- Shall we sit?
- Yep.

04:30.241 --> 04:31.440
Oh, everyone's moving so fast.

04:31.509 --> 04:32.908
I feel like I'm on "Scandal".

04:32.977 --> 04:34.209
Can I get anyone a snack?

04:34.279 --> 04:35.544
I haven't gone to the store yet,

04:35.613 --> 04:37.647
so I just have whatever's here.

04:37.715 --> 04:40.149
Would anyone like a big vitamin?

04:40.217 --> 04:42.585
Wht don't we just send
Chase's assistant out for food?

04:42.654 --> 04:44.620
Ah, assistant, yes, yes, yes.

04:44.689 --> 04:47.725
Well, we have not been able
to fill that posish.

04:47.796 --> 04:48.991
Brookie, you don't have a job.

04:49.059 --> 04:51.197
- You should do it.
- Fuck no!

04:51.252 --> 04:52.662
I mean, no thank you.

04:52.730 --> 04:54.397
Okay, you know what, let's just dive in.

04:54.465 --> 04:56.699
Okay, so as you may know,
we at Principle Records

04:56.768 --> 04:58.734
also work with Yendani.

04:58.803 --> 05:00.569
Oh, my God, I love Yendani.

05:00.638 --> 05:02.505
She's such a hot, badass feminist.

05:02.573 --> 05:03.906
She reminds me of me.

05:03.974 --> 05:05.707
Yeah, and I thought... it was my idea...

05:05.776 --> 05:08.376
since Yendani and Chase
have new albums coming out

05:08.445 --> 05:11.145
in the next couple of months
that they could collaborate.

05:11.214 --> 05:12.814
- Oh, cool.
- On a relationship.

05:12.882 --> 05:14.382
So they start dating tonight.

05:14.451 --> 05:16.017
- I'm sorry, what?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:16.085 --> 05:17.819
She's standing by to video conference.

05:17.887 --> 05:20.355
Oh, you're gonna love her.
She has 8 million followers.

05:20.424 --> 05:22.590
I mean, this is gonna skyrocket Chase

05:22.659 --> 05:23.925
to the next level.

05:23.993 --> 05:26.894
Oh, Chasey, your first girlfriend.

05:26.963 --> 05:28.530
Ew, Mom, no.

05:28.598 --> 05:30.532
No, Gay Brother, this is how
kids meet these days.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.900
They work at the same label,
and then they fall in love.

05:32.969 --> 05:35.203
Yeah, get with the times, dork.

05:35.271 --> 05:36.504
What a dork.

05:36.573 --> 05:38.406
No, Mom, this is crazy, okay?

05:38.475 --> 05:40.942
That's a full-on fake relationship.

05:41.010 --> 05:42.877
When is Matt gonna text me back?

05:42.946 --> 05:45.714
Well, I can't wait to meet
her parents, Mr. and Mrs...?

05:45.782 --> 05:47.581
Oh, she doesn't have a last name.

05:47.650 --> 05:49.950
I mean, well, she did, but
it's Irish, so we dropped it.

05:50.018 --> 05:51.251
- Oh.
- But look, hey,

05:51.320 --> 05:53.119
this isn't a done deal, Dubeks.

05:53.188 --> 05:55.956
I told Yendani's team that I'd
vet this family to make sure

05:56.024 --> 05:58.392
I can't find anything
that would hurt her image.

05:58.461 --> 06:01.895
So I need you all to volunteer

06:01.964 --> 06:04.931
anything that you've done
that could be damaging.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.768
Okay, well, I think for me, I'm good.

06:07.837 --> 06:10.537
Well, we already did a
background check at the label.

06:10.606 --> 06:12.239
This is what we found so far.

06:18.643 --> 06:20.377
All right, everyone take a seat.

06:20.445 --> 06:23.353
Wait, why does Justin
have a church in his house?

06:23.378 --> 06:25.361
And why does the cross
have a little foot on it?

06:25.386 --> 06:26.862
Oh, that's a "T" for Theroux,

06:26.902 --> 06:28.923
because Justin believes
in himself so much.

06:28.948 --> 06:31.338
Ugh, ew. Can we just go
back down to the living room?

06:31.406 --> 06:33.673
No, there's a lot
of bad stuff in this binder,

06:33.742 --> 06:35.275
and I don't want Chase to hear.

06:35.344 --> 06:36.943
Now, I want to start with Cary.

06:37.011 --> 06:39.178
Great, yes, I've done
a lot of bad things.

06:39.248 --> 06:41.681
Um, when I was 11 years old,

06:41.750 --> 06:44.351
I would get boners in church
because one of the altar boys

06:44.419 --> 06:46.587
was super hot, so I would
just tuck my dick

06:46.634 --> 06:48.673
up into my belt during communion.

06:48.758 --> 06:50.658
- Cary.
- I know which altar boy.

06:50.759 --> 06:52.492
And when was in the eighth grade,

06:52.561 --> 06:54.394
we took a class trip to Water World,

06:54.463 --> 06:56.229
and I purposefully rode the log flume

06:56.298 --> 06:58.831
with my friend Kevin's dad
so I could buy

06:58.900 --> 07:01.033
the picture afterwards
and masturbate to it.

07:01.102 --> 07:03.068
Oh, honey, did you hear he died?

07:03.107 --> 07:04.203
I did.

07:04.273 --> 07:07.039
And when I was 23, I worked at a hotel

07:07.108 --> 07:08.642
and Christopher Meloni stayed there,

07:08.710 --> 07:10.910
and one day he went out to the pool,

07:10.979 --> 07:13.913
so I snuck into his room
and smelled his underwear.

07:13.982 --> 07:17.349
But then he returned
to a different room,

07:17.418 --> 07:19.518
so I don't know
whose underwear I smelled.

07:19.587 --> 07:21.420
Oh, my God.
Cary, let me cut to the chase.

07:21.489 --> 07:23.355
Ooh, we should trademark that, my God.

07:23.424 --> 07:25.424
I meant things I could find online.

07:25.493 --> 07:29.095
You just described three
private, sad moments.

07:29.164 --> 07:31.063
How would I find those things?

07:31.132 --> 07:33.432
Oh.

07:33.501 --> 07:35.334
Then...

07:35.403 --> 07:36.807
I'm just kidding.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.570
You know what, I didn't find
anything bad on you.

07:38.639 --> 07:40.471
- Good.
- You can go do your little play.

07:40.525 --> 07:42.707
But, Cary, please have sex.

07:42.777 --> 07:44.977
I'm trying.

07:45.046 --> 07:46.679
I know something bad that I did online.

07:46.747 --> 07:47.813
Good luck, babe.

07:47.881 --> 07:49.480
Beth Kellogg from church

07:49.549 --> 07:51.382
is always posting photos
of these ducks in her yard.

07:51.451 --> 07:54.219
So one night, I did have
a little glass of wine,

07:54.288 --> 07:57.255
I commented, "Enough with the ducks,"

07:57.324 --> 07:58.890
and then I unfriended her.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.658
I already had to change churches,

08:00.727 --> 08:04.296
and now I'm so worried
it's gonna ruin Chase's career.

08:04.364 --> 08:08.166
Awww, that is absolutely
not in this binder.

08:08.235 --> 08:09.334
Ah.

08:09.402 --> 08:11.203
Every single thing in here

08:11.271 --> 08:12.737
is about Brooke.

08:12.806 --> 08:14.306
- Oh.
- Excuse me?

08:14.374 --> 08:16.541
No, my whole thing
is smart, young progressive.

08:16.609 --> 08:19.110
So I don't know what
you think you found,

08:19.179 --> 08:21.346
but... was it my Gchats?

08:21.414 --> 08:23.739
- Nope.
- Oh, then I'm golden. Come at me.

08:23.786 --> 08:26.217
You used the word "retarded" on Twitter

08:26.285 --> 08:28.785
no less than 56 times.

08:28.855 --> 08:30.754
I mean, are we sure that was me?

08:30.823 --> 08:33.256
Your first tweet was,
"Twitter is retarded.

08:33.326 --> 08:34.524
Come at me".

08:34.592 --> 08:35.792
Ooh.

08:35.861 --> 08:37.294
Well, that was a long time ago.

08:37.363 --> 08:38.863
Now I'm a social justice warrior.

08:38.931 --> 08:40.429
People on Twitter always tell me

08:40.499 --> 08:42.299
I'm a classic white feminist.

08:42.368 --> 08:43.667
That's not good.

08:43.736 --> 08:45.736
- And we deleted that account.
- What?

08:45.804 --> 08:48.772
I also deleted
photos of you from Halloween

08:48.841 --> 08:50.174
- as Terri Schiavo.
- What?

08:50.243 --> 08:53.510
Okay, I went as Terri Schiavo before,

08:53.579 --> 08:55.980
and then I happened
to pass out at the party.

08:56.048 --> 08:57.948
Okay, shall I continue?

08:58.017 --> 08:59.616
Well, if you have anything else.

08:59.685 --> 09:01.485
Let's talk about your LiveJournal.

09:01.553 --> 09:02.619
Oh, no.

09:02.688 --> 09:03.753
What do you mean?

09:03.821 --> 09:05.421
He's our brother.

09:05.490 --> 09:07.357
Keep your voice down.
He's been through enough.

09:07.432 --> 09:10.726
- He has a right to know.
- No, we have to protect him.

09:10.797 --> 09:12.929
That's what family does.

09:12.998 --> 09:15.464
So it's settled.

09:15.533 --> 09:17.633
We decide tomorrow.

09:17.702 --> 09:20.603
Agreed. Brian?

09:20.671 --> 09:23.273
- No.
- No?

09:23.341 --> 09:25.308
You think I want to say no?

09:25.377 --> 09:26.943
Like some kind of sick freak?

09:27.012 --> 09:29.512
- Of course not, but...
- But nothing!

09:29.580 --> 09:33.082
We decide the day after tomorrow.

09:33.151 --> 09:37.220
And finally, your Venmo account.

09:37.289 --> 09:40.222
Okay, what could I possibly
have done wrong on Venmo?

09:40.291 --> 09:43.191
Every time you pay Cary for anything,

09:43.260 --> 09:46.861
you write that it's for
"slamming that puss".

09:46.931 --> 09:48.030
- Brooke.
- Well, okay.

09:48.098 --> 09:49.331
That is just sibling humor.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.732
We deleted that account too.

09:50.801 --> 09:52.467
And that's it.

09:52.536 --> 09:54.602
Really? I'm okay?

09:54.671 --> 09:57.406
Well, karmically, you need
to do some soul searching.

09:57.474 --> 10:00.042
- Yeah.
- Optically, we're fine.

10:00.110 --> 10:01.209
- Okay.
- All right.

10:01.278 --> 10:02.844
Let's call Yendani, people.

10:02.913 --> 10:05.880
This is gonna be so romantic.

10:07.384 --> 10:08.850
<i>Hi, Yendani.</i>

10:08.919 --> 10:10.419
Hey, Chase.

10:10.487 --> 10:12.054
Okay, kids, so tonight

10:12.122 --> 10:13.922
we'll start off with Instagram live,

10:13.991 --> 10:16.424
and then tomorrow I have you
on the red carpet

10:16.493 --> 10:18.793
for the Hot 97 Summer Jam.

10:18.862 --> 10:21.095
Oh, my God, I love Summer Jam.

10:21.164 --> 10:25.232
Okay, one year I got so drunk,
and I went home with this guy,

10:25.301 --> 10:26.935
but I was dating somebody else,

10:27.003 --> 10:29.771
and so I waited until
he was asleep to kiss him.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.706
That way it wasn't cheating.

10:31.775 --> 10:34.546
<i>That's sexual assault.</i>

10:36.480 --> 10:40.214
Oh, oh. No, no, you're confused.

10:40.283 --> 10:43.050
I'm a girl, and he just wasn't awake.

10:43.119 --> 10:45.019
And I kissed him, so...

10:45.088 --> 10:48.422
<i>Yeah, no, that's sexual assault.</i>

10:48.491 --> 10:50.724
You know, you make
a great point, Yendani,

10:50.793 --> 10:54.822
and we're gonna take a break
and just think about that.

10:54.864 --> 10:56.072
<i>So...</i>

10:58.767 --> 11:00.834
Okay, we're on mute now.

11:00.903 --> 11:04.037
So everybody keep smiling
and don't move your lips,

11:04.106 --> 11:05.506
'cause this is very bad.

11:05.574 --> 11:07.440
Am I doing it? Are my lips moving?

11:07.510 --> 11:09.042
Oh, I gotta get those pictures.

11:09.111 --> 11:10.878
Who do I gotta suck?
Who do I gotta fuck?

11:10.946 --> 11:12.679
There are no pictures.

11:12.748 --> 11:14.381
Did he wake up and file a report?

11:14.449 --> 11:16.917
No, he doesn't know. Like, nobody knows.

11:16.986 --> 11:18.619
Oh, nobody knows?

11:18.687 --> 11:19.920
Okay, ooh.

11:19.989 --> 11:21.421
- Oh, okay.
- Who gives a shit?

11:21.490 --> 11:23.423
Okay, we're fine. We're fine.

11:23.492 --> 11:25.392
No, we're not fine.

11:25.460 --> 11:29.396
Yendani said it.
I committed sexual assault.

11:29.464 --> 11:32.499
- But no one knows.
- But I know.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.434
And strong, powerful women

11:34.503 --> 11:36.936
like me and Yendani,

11:37.005 --> 11:39.305
we don't do stuff like this.

11:39.374 --> 11:41.541
I have to go tell him.

11:41.609 --> 11:44.310
Someone DVR "Real Housewives
of Atlanta" for me.

11:44.379 --> 11:46.913
I don't think Justin has DVR.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.484
Damn it.

11:51.553 --> 11:53.520
- This again?
- You left.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.422
Not me, not Todd.

11:55.490 --> 11:57.023
You.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.992
He just got back from Afghanistan.

12:00.061 --> 12:02.261
- Let him sleep.
- He has a right to know.

12:02.329 --> 12:03.930
- Hello.
- Hey, I need you to leave

12:03.998 --> 12:05.364
so we can stop the show.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.967
What? Now? I'm really enjoying it.

12:08.036 --> 12:10.302
- Listen, I have a date.
- Oh, my God.

12:10.371 --> 12:11.737
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I'm on it.

12:11.806 --> 12:13.305
Oh, but you have to work
my shift tomorrow.

12:13.374 --> 12:15.174
I have to break up with somebody,

12:15.242 --> 12:16.576
and it's gonna take all day.

12:16.644 --> 12:18.644
Whatever, fine, yes. Okay.

12:18.713 --> 12:20.913
We'll decide the day after tomorrow.

12:20.982 --> 12:23.182
- Yes.
- Ohh!

12:23.250 --> 12:24.784
Oh, my God, something bit me.

12:24.852 --> 12:26.552
Something has bitten me,

12:26.621 --> 12:28.654
and I would love to stay
and watch the rest,

12:28.723 --> 12:30.923
but something bit me,
and so I have to go.

12:30.992 --> 12:33.325
Okay, okay.

12:33.394 --> 12:35.695
Well, I guess that's it
for the show tonight.

12:35.763 --> 12:38.029
Oh, darn, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

12:38.098 --> 12:41.132
Wait, what if we did
this one just for us?

12:41.201 --> 12:42.901
- Eww, no.
- No, Todd.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.502
Go home to your kid.

12:44.571 --> 12:47.472
She's six days old.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.909
Friends? No.

12:53.279 --> 12:56.681
I assaulted you. I assaulted you.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.282
I assault...

12:58.351 --> 13:01.119
Cookbrooke! Ahhh!

13:03.200 --> 13:05.324
What's up, guys?
I'm here with my girl, Yendani,

13:05.349 --> 13:06.615
and I love her so much.

13:06.684 --> 13:08.185
And we love all you fans out there.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.540
This is the best night ever.

13:12.466 --> 13:15.340
Yeah, so I said blinker?
I hardly know her.

13:17.966 --> 13:21.100
You know what, uh...
you know what's also funny?

13:21.169 --> 13:23.570
Uh, Matt only has, like,
three pairs of socks,

13:23.639 --> 13:26.629
so he's always needing to wear mine.

13:26.707 --> 13:29.020
He's probably wearing
my socks right now.

13:29.106 --> 13:31.052
Isn't that so funny?

13:31.112 --> 13:33.747
I mean, he's right. I am, yeah.

13:33.816 --> 13:36.049
Oh, hey, you guys
want to play Skee-Ball?

13:36.117 --> 13:39.085
- Yeah, let's freaking do it.
- Yeah, let's go.

13:41.957 --> 13:44.991
And you were sleeping, and...

13:47.628 --> 13:50.929
I kissed you.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.130
Dope.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.567
No, Lance. Not dope.

13:54.635 --> 13:55.901
You didn't give consent.

13:55.970 --> 13:58.103
It's all good. I would have.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.872
Lance, focus, okay?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.273
I'm sorry.

14:01.342 --> 14:03.776
I assaulted you. That is not okay.

14:03.845 --> 14:07.279
And more importantly,
it's just not who I am.

14:08.883 --> 14:10.383
Yeah, it is.

14:10.451 --> 14:12.385
Come on, you do crazy shit
like this all the time.

14:12.453 --> 14:14.052
This is classic Brooke.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.755
Wait, what?

14:15.823 --> 14:17.757
Ohh.

14:17.825 --> 14:19.825
"What makes your
relationship so strong?"

14:19.894 --> 14:21.560
We just respect each other's needs.

14:21.629 --> 14:23.728
And each other's work,
including our albums,

14:23.797 --> 14:25.497
- which are out later this year.
- Yes, yes, yes.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.198
But we both love ice cream.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.000
Ice cream! Ice cream!

14:31.337 --> 14:34.739
I asked you out, just you and me.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.275
What the shit is...

14:37.343 --> 14:38.610
Hey, what's up?

14:38.678 --> 14:40.712
I'm having fun. This is fun.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.719
I gotta piss so hard.

14:50.221 --> 14:52.254
Whoo-whoo!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.265
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yes. Yeah.

15:02.304 --> 15:04.155
Finally, yes, yes.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.703
Party at our place, guys!

15:06.772 --> 15:10.408
BYOB, baby!

15:10.476 --> 15:13.377
Okay, what else?
What else is Classic Brooke?

15:13.446 --> 15:15.879
- Um, she's hot, she's cool.
- Yes, Classic Brooke.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.548
She's fun. She loves to party.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.550
You know, in moderation.
Sure, Classic Brooke.

15:19.618 --> 15:22.386
She has always got deodorant
on the outside of her clothing.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.088
No, that is not Classic Brooke. Next.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.556
Doesn't brush her teeth.

15:25.624 --> 15:26.991
Well, no, not at night.
I wanna go to sleep.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.692
- Next.
- She lies for fun.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.994
She steals from Starbucks.
She never drinks water.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.229
- She falls asleep during plays.
- Okay, no, no, no, no.

15:33.298 --> 15:34.998
I don't... no. I want to stop.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.767
Let's just stop.

15:36.836 --> 15:40.070
Brooke Who's Talking, are you okay?

15:40.138 --> 15:41.638
I don't know.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.941
I don't know what I am.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.877
How are you?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.212
- I'm pretty good.
- Yeah?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.348
I left the Foot Locker.

15:51.416 --> 15:52.916
- You did?
- Yeah.

15:52.985 --> 15:55.085
I got this amazing job
at this new startup,

15:55.153 --> 15:56.954
and I have a new shoe idea.

15:57.022 --> 16:00.190
Okay, it's like a regular shoe,

16:00.258 --> 16:03.694
but it has this little
baby drawer in the sole

16:03.762 --> 16:06.129
that you can put all of your change in.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.567
So you just, like, hear coins
when you walk around?

16:11.636 --> 16:13.633
Hell, yeah. It's like
how everybody's always talking

16:13.719 --> 16:15.266
about how they want to look
like a million bucks.

16:15.344 --> 16:18.041
But now you can also
sound like a dollar.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.243
Wow. That's a great idea, Lance.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.578
You know, being single
has kind of given me

16:22.647 --> 16:25.581
this opportunity to really
concentrate on myself

16:25.650 --> 16:27.950
and move forward.

16:30.355 --> 16:31.921
Well, that's cool.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.824
Yeah, I'm... I'm moving forward too.

16:34.893 --> 16:37.593
You know, I... I didn't want to brag,

16:37.662 --> 16:41.864
but I'm, uh, I'm living in SoHo
at Justin Theroux's house.

16:41.933 --> 16:43.432
- "Lego Ninjago!"
- Yeah.

16:43.501 --> 16:44.799
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah.

16:44.868 --> 16:46.335
And I got a job as an assistant

16:46.404 --> 16:48.137
for a really famous singer,
so, you know,

16:48.205 --> 16:49.171
I'm just, like, working all the time,

16:49.240 --> 16:50.805
being responsible.

16:50.874 --> 16:52.574
I'm just... I'm being Classic Brooke.

16:52.643 --> 16:54.543
So anyway, I gotta go.

16:54.611 --> 16:56.678
What, you don't wanna stay and hang out?

16:56.747 --> 17:00.249
I can't, Lance. I'm a businesswoman now.

17:00.317 --> 17:01.783
I'm watching
"Real Housewives of Atlanta".

17:05.622 --> 17:07.356
Damn it.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.391
Right?

17:09.460 --> 17:11.160
Oh, yo, should I fire up the Wii?

17:11.228 --> 17:12.627
Hell yeah, I don't have work tomorrow.

17:12.695 --> 17:14.663
- Yeah, baby!
- All night!

17:14.731 --> 17:16.431
Cakes and eggs!

17:16.499 --> 17:18.232
You guys can sleep over too, you know?

17:18.300 --> 17:20.569
Cary's room, the couch, whatever.

17:20.637 --> 17:23.003
- Oh, yeah, we got taquitos.
- Oh, no!

17:23.073 --> 17:24.305
Ow.

17:24.374 --> 17:26.174
Oh! Ow!

17:26.242 --> 17:28.108
Oh! Ah!

17:28.178 --> 17:29.611
Ow, ow, ow.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.412
Yo, bro, you all right?

17:31.481 --> 17:32.981
- Oh, yeah, now...
- Jeez.

17:33.050 --> 17:35.617
I didn't mean to hit my face.
I mean, ow, ow.

17:35.686 --> 17:37.418
Hey, guys, think you better bounce.

17:37.487 --> 17:38.954
I gotta take care of my roomie here.

17:39.022 --> 17:40.589
I think you guys should bounce.

17:40.657 --> 17:43.191
Yeah, I am so sorry.

17:43.259 --> 17:45.694
Oh, I know, I know. Next time.

17:45.762 --> 17:46.783
Yeah, oh, yeah.

17:46.853 --> 17:49.197
Come on, just give me all your weight.

17:49.275 --> 17:50.497
Okay.

17:50.566 --> 17:53.431
Oh, boy, you are light.
You're like my sister.

18:07.405 --> 18:09.371
Holy shit.

18:09.444 --> 18:12.330
Oh, honey, can you please
turn off the lights?

18:12.372 --> 18:14.105
Mom?

18:14.143 --> 18:16.994
Why are you sleeping by a pool?

18:17.073 --> 18:19.184
Justin only has one bedroom

18:19.253 --> 18:21.687
but three saunas.

18:21.756 --> 18:23.456
Oh, well, you gotta try new things,

18:23.525 --> 18:26.035
and this is my year of yes.

18:26.090 --> 18:28.327
Yeah, you keep saying that.

18:28.396 --> 18:30.168
Oh, how was Chase's big date?

18:30.216 --> 18:32.416
- They broke up.
- No.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.985
Yendani got an offer

18:34.053 --> 18:36.087
to start dating
Millie Bobby Brown tomorrow.

18:36.155 --> 18:38.522
- What about Chase?
- He's gonna wear glasses.

18:38.591 --> 18:40.557
Shuli's calling it Glasses Saturday.

18:40.626 --> 18:42.092
No, I mean, is he okay?

18:42.160 --> 18:43.527
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

18:43.596 --> 18:45.896
That's just how the kids
date these days.

18:45.965 --> 18:47.163
Okay.

18:47.232 --> 18:49.600
Well, I just wanted to let you know

18:49.668 --> 18:53.470
that I've decided
to be Chase's assistant.

18:53.539 --> 18:56.907
Oh, Brookie and Chasey.

18:56.976 --> 18:58.675
Yeah, but only until
I figure out what it is

18:58.744 --> 19:00.210
that I really want to do.

19:00.278 --> 19:02.813
Also, I'm gonna crash here.

19:02.882 --> 19:05.281
- Yay, roomies!
- Okay, just for now.

19:05.350 --> 19:08.118
So I guess I'll

19:08.186 --> 19:09.887
find a place to sleep.

19:09.955 --> 19:11.788
I know, I should get some shut-eye, too.

19:11.857 --> 19:13.891
I have so many meetings this week.

19:13.959 --> 19:16.659
- With who?
- Oh, anyone that wants one.

19:16.728 --> 19:18.427
Okay.

19:18.496 --> 19:19.629
Good night, Mom.

19:19.697 --> 19:22.264
Good night.

19:22.333 --> 19:25.234
I'm so happy you're home, Brookie.

19:59.736 --> 20:02.503
Perfect.

20:12.115 --> 20:13.782
How you doing, buddy?

20:13.850 --> 20:15.149
I'm all right, thanks.

20:15.218 --> 20:17.418
Here you go.

20:18.889 --> 20:21.322
Weird, I am so hard right now.

20:24.393 --> 20:25.859
Oh, whoa, whoa.

20:25.928 --> 20:27.928
Don't wanna hurt your lip.

20:30.833 --> 20:33.033
But I guess you could...

20:52.154 --> 20:54.788
This is good. I like this.

20:59.655 --> 21:01.764
'Sup, fam?
Just thought we owed it to you

21:01.819 --> 21:03.318
to explain what happened.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.584
Sometimes two people can love each other

21:05.624 --> 21:08.591
and still not be right for each other.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.261
But I'll always love ChaseDreams.

21:11.330 --> 21:14.128
Like and comment on his
Insta if you want to.

21:14.558 --> 21:15.948
Oh, my God go to Hell's Kitchen,

21:15.987 --> 21:18.080
you'll find plenty
of colorful underwear.

21:18.105 --> 21:20.235
But how do I get to
Hell's Kitchen from here?

21:22.528 --> 21:24.836
Hello and welcome to The Other Show.

21:24.861 --> 21:27.242
My name is Chris Kelly and this is?

21:27.267 --> 21:28.291
I'm Sarah Schneider.

21:28.316 --> 21:30.269
And we're here to talk about episode 3

21:30.270 --> 21:32.487
which is "Chase Gets a Girlfriend".

21:32.512 --> 21:33.550
Yes.

21:33.575 --> 21:35.716
We have Drew, Helene and Ken Marino.

21:35.741 --> 21:37.270
- Hello.
- Hi, Ken.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.111
Hi, Ken.

21:39.112 --> 21:40.361
- Hi!
- Hi!

21:40.386 --> 21:41.882
Hi!

21:41.907 --> 21:42.952
Ew.

21:42.977 --> 21:44.117
This is already the most annoying...

21:44.118 --> 21:45.118
What do you mean?

21:45.119 --> 21:46.908
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Whatever...

21:46.940 --> 21:48.713
People, somebody just clicked away.

21:48.738 --> 21:51.723
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Brooke. Gay brother.

21:51.724 --> 21:54.026
We have an important PR
opportunity to discuss.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.644
- It was my idea.
- Yeah.

21:55.669 --> 21:58.089
And it's for tonight so
we have no time to waste.

21:58.114 --> 21:59.222
I thought of it.

21:59.247 --> 22:00.949
Right out the gate, this is very cheesy

22:00.973 --> 22:02.273
to say to your face.

22:02.274 --> 22:04.642
But we were big fans
of yours for a while,

22:04.643 --> 22:06.064
I mean since we were like three or four.

22:06.089 --> 22:08.813
We just loved you.

22:08.814 --> 22:12.150
Some of the first words
I said were Ken Marino.

22:12.151 --> 22:14.318
No, but we have just
loved you and everything

22:14.319 --> 22:16.420
and we were so excited when you were...

22:16.421 --> 22:19.323
willing to take a coffee
to talk about this show.

22:19.324 --> 22:21.392
We did have a coffee
and talked about the show.

22:21.417 --> 22:24.162
We're on mute now so
everybody keep smiling

22:24.163 --> 22:26.264
and don't move your lips...

22:26.265 --> 22:27.665
cause this is very bad.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.834
- Am I doing it?
- Are my lips moving?

22:29.835 --> 22:31.502
Oh, I gotta get those pictures.

22:31.503 --> 22:33.004
Who do I gotta suck,
who do I gotta [bleep]?

22:33.005 --> 22:36.007
When we met with you, you
already kind of had like,

22:36.008 --> 22:38.385
- a lot of ideas for this character.
- I did?

22:38.410 --> 22:40.178
You pitched us immediately that he had

22:40.179 --> 22:42.013
two empty jacuzzis at his home

22:42.014 --> 22:43.848
and a lazy river that ram between them.

22:43.849 --> 22:45.349
But he had to run out
of money to fill them,

22:45.350 --> 22:46.684
so they were just empty.

22:46.685 --> 22:49.251
So the whole season,
he's dealing with the permits

22:49.276 --> 22:50.759
and he never gets it.

22:50.784 --> 22:52.728
Ultimately he wasted
a lot of money on it,

22:52.753 --> 22:54.768
and he's never gonna be
able to fill it with water.

22:54.793 --> 22:57.028
So when watching the show just know that

22:57.029 --> 22:58.796
the character of Streeter,
we never mention it

22:58.797 --> 23:00.289
but he is dealing with a
lot of permitting issues.

23:00.314 --> 23:01.833
Lot of permitting issues.

23:01.834 --> 23:03.582
I can't talk right
now, his neck is bound.

23:03.607 --> 23:04.652
What?

23:04.677 --> 23:06.370
<i>Yeah I'm just trying
to keep his Adam's apple</i>

23:06.371 --> 23:09.353
under control, gotta keep that
neck looking young and slick.

23:09.378 --> 23:12.710
The character does a lot of
things that are a little...

23:12.711 --> 23:16.314
rough to a child, like
in the previous episode.

23:16.315 --> 23:20.433
His binding his neck, keeping
his Adam's apple down.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.987
- Bleaches his tongue.
- He's making it pinker.

23:22.988 --> 23:24.856
And so, but we were trying
to find the balance of

23:24.857 --> 23:26.224
someone who could...

23:26.225 --> 23:27.992
sell that comedy without being

23:27.993 --> 23:31.229
"holy shit what is
happening to this child".

23:31.230 --> 23:32.997
Well, I hope that works out.

23:32.998 --> 23:34.599
- I guess we'll see.
- I don't know we'll see.

23:34.624 --> 23:36.067
See what the critics say.

23:36.068 --> 23:37.568
See if America turns on you.

23:37.569 --> 23:39.570
His face is kind enough to hurt a child.

23:39.571 --> 23:41.318
Yeah, that's what we were looking for.

23:41.343 --> 23:43.111
Oh, kiss my butt.

23:43.175 --> 23:48.180
What? I'm a New Yorker now, hey!

23:48.413 --> 23:50.014
I think when we were talking in the room

23:50.015 --> 23:51.249
we thought it was funny cause,

23:51.274 --> 23:53.084
the day that Chase Dreams
lands into your key

23:53.085 --> 23:55.726
immediately moves into
Justin Theroux's penthouse.

23:55.751 --> 23:58.556
And how ridiculous that is,
in comparison to like

23:58.557 --> 24:01.405
how we probably all lived when
we moved there when we were 19?

24:01.430 --> 24:04.362
I moved to New York when
I was 22, right after college

24:04.363 --> 24:05.563
and I saved up.

24:05.564 --> 24:07.364
And within 10 minutes of being there,

24:07.389 --> 24:09.434
two people walked up to me, at gun point

24:09.435 --> 24:10.935
and stole all of my things.

24:10.936 --> 24:13.204
Completely robbed me,
stole all of my suitcases.

24:13.205 --> 24:15.940
And so then, I called
my dad and he was like

24:15.941 --> 24:17.742
"We will never tell
your mother about this".

24:17.743 --> 24:19.744
Cause she was so terrified
that I was moving to New York.

24:19.745 --> 24:22.391
So we just never told my mom about it.

24:22.416 --> 24:24.549
I've been mugged, I was mugged.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.020
- You have been mugged?
- I was too, yeah.

24:27.045 --> 24:28.753
Is everybody getting mugged?

24:28.754 --> 24:30.254
I've been mugged, when I was in college

24:30.255 --> 24:31.889
I went away for
Thanksgiving and came back

24:31.890 --> 24:33.424
and my house had been emptied.

24:33.425 --> 24:35.660
Like literally the washer
and dryer was gone,

24:35.661 --> 24:36.794
- it was like the Grinch.
- What?

24:36.795 --> 24:38.463
It was very intense.

24:38.464 --> 24:41.466
But they did leave one
DVD which had a message

24:41.467 --> 24:43.468
and the DVD was "You got served".

24:43.469 --> 24:45.470
- Wow, that's good.
- That's good.

24:45.471 --> 24:47.405
Is that funny, cause
I'd have laughed at that.

24:47.406 --> 24:48.473
That's pretty good.

24:48.474 --> 24:49.774
Well, maybe I should've been robbed.

24:49.775 --> 24:51.739
I was trying to buy Dave
Matthews' band tickets...

24:52.978 --> 24:54.912
I was, I have the tickets and I was like

24:54.913 --> 24:59.150
"Okay, I want them" because
I have bad taste in music.

24:59.151 --> 25:01.573
So I put them in my pocket
and I turned around

25:01.598 --> 25:02.588
and was walking away.

25:02.613 --> 25:06.541
And I looked down and it was
for like, two days before.

25:06.566 --> 25:08.092
It was like the wrong ticket.

25:08.093 --> 25:11.696
I ran after him and he
hopped the turnstile

25:11.697 --> 25:13.998
so I stood at the turnstile
and was like...

25:13.999 --> 25:15.833
"He's robbed me".

25:15.834 --> 25:18.645
And everyone just looked at
him a got out of his way.

25:18.670 --> 25:21.237
- Did he even look back?
- No! No, no, no, nothing.

25:21.262 --> 25:23.846
What he left and I got
"you got served" DVD.

25:24.943 --> 25:26.177
Can you believe it?

25:26.178 --> 25:28.679
Wait is this Justin Theroux's apartment?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.148
Yes! How did you know?

25:30.149 --> 25:33.117
Uh, because I'm looking
at a huge photo of him,

25:33.118 --> 25:34.519
so I hope it is.

25:34.520 --> 25:37.822
I'm curious about how you
picked the Justin Theroux photo.

25:37.823 --> 25:40.458
- Which is like there's something...
- There's like pubes in it.

25:40.459 --> 25:41.692
- Actually...
- There were pubes,

25:41.693 --> 25:43.952
but then we had to take the pubes out.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.788
- Take the pubes down.
- The pubes were taken down.

25:45.813 --> 25:46.864
So we had to tamp down the pubes.

25:46.865 --> 25:48.366
Tamp down pubes, classic.

25:48.367 --> 25:50.535
But I'm hoping like, when
it airs in Comedy Central

25:50.536 --> 25:52.910
there's no pubes.
But then if you watch it on iTunes,

25:52.935 --> 25:54.932
we have so many [bleep] pubes
popping out there.

25:56.542 --> 25:59.014
- We have pubes for everyone.
- Yeah!

25:59.039 --> 26:01.891
Oh, no! Ow!

26:02.958 --> 26:03.959
Ow!

26:05.796 --> 26:07.195
Ow, ow, ow!

26:07.220 --> 26:08.757
Yo, bro, you all right?

26:08.782 --> 26:10.721
- Oh, yeah, no...
- Jeez.

26:10.722 --> 26:13.283
I didn't mean to hit my face.
I mean... Ow, ow!

26:13.308 --> 26:16.586
I, when I was in college,
was flirting with a guy

26:16.611 --> 26:19.230
and weirdly it was like a
thing for girls to like,

26:19.231 --> 26:21.399
let guys know they were like flexible.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.495
I went to theaters school
when I was a dancer,

26:23.520 --> 26:25.636
I did splits at so
many parties being like...

26:25.637 --> 26:28.206
"This is crazy! I can
just fall into this".

26:28.207 --> 26:29.493
I was a virgin.

26:29.518 --> 26:31.509
I was talking to a guy and to that point

26:31.510 --> 26:33.878
tried to do a high kick, as you do.

26:33.879 --> 26:36.080
In no long conversation
and I kicked so hard,

26:36.081 --> 26:38.015
that I kicked my other
foot out from under me

26:38.016 --> 26:39.917
and landed on my back in
the middle of the quad.

26:39.918 --> 26:41.891
- What?
- It impressed him.

26:41.916 --> 26:46.090
I've definitely learned too many
John Mayer songs on the guitar.

26:46.091 --> 26:47.925
- Oof.
- Oh, my God.

26:47.926 --> 26:49.927
Cut! Cut!

26:49.928 --> 26:50.928
Let's finish it.

26:50.929 --> 26:52.187
Well, thank you for watching.

26:52.212 --> 26:54.490
This has been another
episode of The Other Show.

26:54.515 --> 26:56.125
And we'll see you next week.

26:56.150 --> 26:58.054
Do a kick.

26:58.079 --> 26:59.592
- What? Are you impressed?
- She is flexible.

26:59.624 --> 27:02.060
Woah! Marry me.
