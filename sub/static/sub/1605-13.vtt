I will take it back

04:14.232 --> 04:16.067
I assume by your
choice of material,

04:16.151 --> 04:18.153
you're interested in
the part of an angel?

04:18.320 --> 04:19.529
Yes, ma'am.
That's correct,

04:19.654 --> 04:22.491
because last year I was up
on this stage as the ox,

04:22.574 --> 04:24.660
and the year before
that I was the ass.

04:24.785 --> 04:26.369

but I'm really startin'

I need a marriage request form.

You need a form
and my approval,

04:52.270 --> 04:53.689
which you don't have.

04:53.772 --> 04:54.898
Please, Mr. Healy.

04:55.024 --> 04:56.566
Marriage is a privilege.

04:56.692 --> 04:58.735
You are not entitled to it.

Now, have some self-respect
and don't make me do it.

05:46.825 --> 05:49.536
It smells good, though.

05:49.619 --> 05:51.955
Navy bean.
I'll save you a bowl.

05:52.206 --> 05:55.042

06:04.801 --> 06:05.928

(CHUCKLES)

06:24.780 --> 06:25.822
Go on.

06:25.948 --> 06:27.032
So, after the
tragedy with Miller,

06:27.116 --> 06:29.659
I was determined to find out if drugs
were in fact coming into the prison.

06:29.785 --> 06:32.121
I thought, um...
I had a hunch.

06:32.246 --> 06:34.726
So when the vegetable truck pulled
up, I went through the boxes.

06:34.748 --> 06:35.958
Let me stop you there.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.751
So, you went through
the boxes before they

06:37.834 --> 06:39.502
actually came
onto the property?

06:39.628 --> 06:41.255
That's correct.
At the gate.

06:41.463 --> 06:44.633
So you didn't find drugs in the
kitchen or on prison grounds?

06:45.092 --> 06:47.343
No, ma'am, the pills were
in a box of cabbage,

06:47.469 --> 06:48.762
and I brought them
straight to Caputo.

06:48.845 --> 06:49.888
Okay.

06:49.972 --> 06:52.182
Well, Bennett.

06:53.016 --> 06:54.101
Uh, John?

06:54.851 --> 06:55.978
Yeah.

06:57.311 --> 07:02.358
John, your intentions
were so good here,

07:02.484 --> 07:04.153
but from what
you're telling me,

07:04.278 --> 07:07.781
Neptune's Produce didn't
bring drugs into the prison.

07:07.864 --> 07:09.158
You did.

07:09.283 --> 07:10.575
(SCOFFS)

07:10.867 --> 07:12.535
(STAMMERS) What are you
talkin' about?

07:12.661 --> 07:16.623
You just said that you found
the drugs in the cabbage

07:16.706 --> 07:19.751
before the truck
pulled onto the campus,

07:19.835 --> 07:22.171
and then you brought
them to Caputo.

07:22.337 --> 07:24.214
- That's right, but...
- John,

07:25.340 --> 07:28.426
you are one of the good guys.
I know that.

07:28.677 --> 07:31.054
So, I want to protect you.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.183
I think it's best if you don't
fill out a report on this.

07:34.474 --> 07:36.643
But they were going
to the kitchen.

07:36.810 --> 07:38.020
It's not like the truck
was making stops

07:38.103 --> 07:39.938
between the front gate
and the loading dock.

07:40.022 --> 07:41.190
We don't know that.

07:41.982 --> 07:43.900
- Of course we do.
- Bennett,

07:44.359 --> 07:47.612
I am so impressed by
how you've handled things.

07:48.363 --> 07:51.116
And you know what? I am going
to authorize incentive pay.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.953
That's an extra $130 a month.

07:55.162 --> 07:56.621
- Thank you, but...
- Now...

07:56.705 --> 07:57.706
Hmm.

07:57.789 --> 08:01.168
You go do your job and let
me take it from here.

08:01.335 --> 08:02.544
Okay, John?

08:05.380 --> 08:07.590
- Howard, Larry's here!
- Hey, Pop.

08:07.716 --> 08:08.842
AMY: You want
a cup of decaf?

08:08.925 --> 08:10.886
I have this vanilla
coconut creamer I put in.

08:11.011 --> 08:12.095
It's delicious.
I'll make you one.

08:12.221 --> 08:13.222
- Thanks, Ma.
- Mmm.

08:13.847 --> 08:15.390
You read about this
Google Glass thing?

08:15.473 --> 08:16.808
We're gonna all
look like cyborgs.

08:17.351 --> 08:19.686
Cyborgs? Aren't those your
neighbors down in Florida?

08:19.811 --> 08:21.563
So, to what do we
owe this pleasure?

08:21.938 --> 08:24.316
I went to the movies on
86th, so, I was nearby.

08:24.399 --> 08:25.901
- Anything good?
- Nah.

08:25.984 --> 08:27.505
AMY: My friends
loved your radio thing.

08:27.569 --> 08:29.821
Everyone was talking
about it at mahjong.

08:29.905 --> 08:32.782
Did Piper enjoy it? I never
got the full report from you.

08:32.908 --> 08:35.910
Uh, she had some
issues with it.

08:36.035 --> 08:38.871
But, uh, we talked
them through.

08:39.873 --> 08:43.043
And then we kept talking and
at the end of our talk,

08:43.168 --> 08:45.754
we decided that we were gonna
get married right away.

08:45.837 --> 08:48.215
While she's still in there.

08:48.298 --> 08:49.591
As soon as possible.

08:49.716 --> 08:51.134
So...

08:53.178 --> 08:55.764
That's really the full
report, since you asked.

09:00.977 --> 09:03.105
I think this is the longest you
two have ever been silent.

09:03.188 --> 09:04.814
Why are you rushing this?

09:04.940 --> 09:07.442
I want to start my life, Ma.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.611
I want to know that
we are committed

09:09.694 --> 09:11.613
and that our commitment
is taken seriously.

09:11.738 --> 09:13.740
So, take it seriously.
You need a paper for that?

09:14.116 --> 09:16.451
You've known we were getting married, Dad.
This is not new information.

09:16.576 --> 09:19.246
The point is that Piper is
spending a year in an institution.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.706
You can't tell what she's gonna
be like when she gets out.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.959
Or when she gets
out, for that matter.

09:24.042 --> 09:25.377
Things are arbitrary in there.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.129
You give someone the wrong
look on the wrong day...

09:27.254 --> 09:28.255
(WHISTLES)

09:28.338 --> 09:30.382
Why don't you just wait and
see how things turn out?

09:30.465 --> 09:32.717
Yeah, if you meet someone else
in the meantime, you'll have...

09:32.801 --> 09:36.972
I don't want to wait and see. I don't
want to meet anyone else, okay?

09:37.055 --> 09:40.058
I love her and I want to spend
the rest of my life with her.

09:40.142 --> 09:41.726
In all her ways.

09:41.935 --> 09:44.104
She's had some
interesting ways so far.

09:44.187 --> 09:46.606
Girl ways. Boy ways. Drug ways.

09:46.689 --> 09:47.816
Ma!

09:48.150 --> 09:52.279
I get it, Larry, she's a natural blonde.
She's exotic for you.

09:52.988 --> 09:56.491
But exotic is for pets and vacations,
it's not for making a life.

09:57.326 --> 10:00.287
You think I'm that shallow?
I know her.

10:00.454 --> 10:02.497
She is exciting,
I'll give you that,

10:02.580 --> 10:04.624
but does she share your values?

10:04.791 --> 10:06.001
Will she be a good mother?

10:06.084 --> 10:08.837
Does she make you feel
good about yourself?

10:09.421 --> 10:10.464
I think so.

10:10.546 --> 10:11.756
Why, you can't remember?

10:11.840 --> 10:14.176
Yes, she does.
Of course she does.

10:15.177 --> 10:19.181
Look, we've been together a long time.
We're invested.

10:19.348 --> 10:21.057
Are you calculating
your opportunity costs

10:21.183 --> 10:22.434
or are you
discussing love here?

10:22.517 --> 10:24.853
AMY: Why don't you just
wait until she gets out?

10:25.020 --> 10:27.814
See if you're still compatible.
Spend some time.

10:27.897 --> 10:29.483
Larry, why are you
in such a hurry?

10:30.859 --> 10:32.235
It's not like
she's going anywhere.

10:32.361 --> 10:34.361
What, are you afraid she's
gonna meet someone else?

Not a shocker, but I had
gotten my hopes up.

10:56.343 --> 10:57.886
I'm getting married.

11:12.401 --> 11:16.279

I pick Larry.

11:21.826 --> 11:23.453
Of course you do.

11:23.703 --> 11:25.455
I love you, too.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.085
But we both know
I don't have the balls

11:30.210 --> 11:31.794
to free fall through
life with you.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.755
No. You don't.

11:36.383 --> 11:38.927
- At least I made a decision, right?

means going forward.

12:00.115 --> 12:04.411

Not with your problems.

Not with your love.

Not with your need
or sadness or anger,

12:10.542 --> 12:14.212

specifically your laundry day.

12:15.797 --> 12:18.425
You may never come to me again.

12:21.177 --> 12:22.471
Ever.

12:36.359 --> 12:38.487
Well, what do you know?

12:38.652 --> 12:40.113
Jesus. What are
you doing here?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.782
Relax, man. Just here to
get my paycheck, shit.

12:42.865 --> 12:44.326
Oh, It's nice to see
you, too, buddy.

12:44.451 --> 12:46.328
Sorry. I'm just... It's
a surprise, I mean.

12:46.495 --> 12:49.164
Spit it out.
Have you seen her?

12:49.289 --> 12:50.582
You gave her my note, right?

12:50.664 --> 12:51.874
I wrote her a letter,
didn't put my name on it.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.585
But she'll know who it's from.
She say anything?

12:53.667 --> 12:55.170
- Who?
- Who?

12:55.295 --> 12:59.048
My girl, man! Fuck! Oh, God, I
can't keep my brain off of her!

12:59.174 --> 13:01.593
What do you think you're
gonna do about that?

13:01.717 --> 13:04.846
Man's greatest struggle in life
is to find a woman who's sexy

13:04.971 --> 13:06.556
but, like, still
could be a mom.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.224
She's that, Benny.

13:08.350 --> 13:11.269
I feel like she
could be the one.

13:11.436 --> 13:13.729
You know, I see myself
buying sheets with her.

13:13.855 --> 13:15.607
Taking trips to Mount Rushmore.

13:15.689 --> 13:16.690
That's great.

13:16.774 --> 13:18.734
Oh, she's got
these lips, Jesus!

13:18.860 --> 13:20.445
I had no idea. I always
dated women with thin lips.

13:20.529 --> 13:21.946
It's a fucking revelation.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.365
Isn't something on the
record with you guys now?

13:23.448 --> 13:24.824
I mean, how does that play out?

13:24.949 --> 13:26.201
I dunno, but whatever
it is, she's worth it.

13:26.284 --> 13:28.578
Hey, if you get any info, intel,
insight, fucking call me, all right?

13:28.702 --> 13:30.783
- Happy holidays, man.
- Hey, what about your paycheck?

13:32.706 --> 13:34.792
ANGIE: You know your
lines yet for the pageant?

13:34.876 --> 13:37.253
I dunno. 'Cause I
can't concentrate

13:37.379 --> 13:39.506
with Satan's Girl Scout
skipping around.

13:39.964 --> 13:43.426
I was a Girl Scout.
Troop 247.

13:43.801 --> 13:45.887
(CHUCKLES) They taught
us how to use tampons.

13:48.223 --> 13:52.602
You are still on
probationary term, Leanne.

13:52.726 --> 13:54.521
Don't be talking
about tampons while

13:54.604 --> 13:57.399
I'm sittin' here plottin' my revenge.
Thanks.

13:58.608 --> 14:00.109
Okay, I figured it out.

14:00.235 --> 14:02.237
She don't need God. That
was a misinterpretation.

14:02.362 --> 14:05.240
I went back to my book
to find some answers.

14:05.323 --> 14:07.116
I needed a clear answer.

14:07.242 --> 14:10.579
Luke, 19:27,
Jesus said,

14:10.704 --> 14:12.288
"But those mine enemies,

14:12.414 --> 14:15.375
"which would not that
I should reign over them,

14:15.458 --> 14:19.212
"bring hither, and
slay them before me."

14:20.088 --> 14:23.258
And I found it. I found it.
I turned right to the page.

14:23.383 --> 14:27.136
Now if that ain't a sign,
I don't know what is.

14:30.265 --> 14:33.935
Is it just me, or are these
eggs, like, extra spicy?

14:34.018 --> 14:35.562
My mouth is on fire.

14:37.439 --> 14:40.191
Okay, so, for Secret Santa,

14:40.275 --> 14:44.738
I've got you guys, Red, Norma,
Gina, I'm putting Alex in.

14:45.614 --> 14:47.115
Think we should ask Chapman?

14:47.198 --> 14:49.618
Hmm. I think she'd
give good gifts.

14:49.867 --> 14:53.288
Come on, you guys, Secret Santa
is supposed to be like family.

14:53.455 --> 14:56.249
What, you honestly think
Chapman and Vause are family?

14:56.332 --> 14:57.917
Well, I think it's nice.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.045
We don't have Mercy anymore.
And Tricia.

15:05.841 --> 15:08.970
Let's throw 'em in. Expand the circle.
It's fucking Christmas.

15:09.137 --> 15:12.056
All right. All right. Hey, you
gonna finish those eggs...

15:12.181 --> 15:16.394
No! No! You can't have these.
They're good this morning.

15:16.561 --> 15:18.896
Do not say that to Red.
Whatever you do.

15:18.980 --> 15:22.525
As far as we're concerned,
breakfast was a mess, <i>capisce?</i>

15:22.692 --> 15:24.152
Hmm. Yeah.
Of course.

15:24.277 --> 15:26.488
Sure. But when she gets
back in the kitchen,

15:26.571 --> 15:28.332
could you ask her to
make the eggs like this?

15:28.364 --> 15:30.492
Because they are delicious.

15:32.076 --> 15:33.953
You're both asking
for fuckin' trouble.

15:34.078 --> 15:35.455
(WHIMPERING)

15:35.538 --> 15:39.501
Chapman, hello.
Happy holidays.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.127
Happy holidays.

15:41.210 --> 15:43.087
You are a first time offender

15:43.171 --> 15:46.508
with a short sentence,
and you're white.

15:47.133 --> 15:48.968
Which means there
are a lot of programs

15:49.051 --> 15:50.845
here that you probably
are not aware of,

15:50.928 --> 15:53.014
because you're lucky
enough not to meet them.

15:53.139 --> 15:54.182
I'm sure.

15:54.307 --> 15:55.642
Like the GED program.

15:55.725 --> 15:58.603
We've allocated some funds to
bring that back in the new year.

15:58.812 --> 16:00.438
Well, that's great to hear.

16:01.147 --> 16:03.274
I don't personally
care for talk radio.

16:03.358 --> 16:07.195
The incessant chatting gives me
a migraine, but some people do,

16:07.320 --> 16:09.739
and apparently, some
of these little shows

16:09.864 --> 16:12.492
have fans that write articles.

16:13.117 --> 16:15.787
Oh. This is about
Larry's radio thing.

16:15.870 --> 16:19.332
Yeah. I believe he got
some of the facts wrong.

16:19.457 --> 16:21.710
But, you know,
it's not a news story.

16:21.835 --> 16:27.006
It's more like, um,
storytelling.

16:27.089 --> 16:28.216
Did you listen to it?

16:28.299 --> 16:29.300
No.

16:31.177 --> 16:33.221
So, here's what
I need from you.

16:33.346 --> 16:36.932
On the off chance that there's
a follow-up storytelling,

16:37.058 --> 16:41.771
it would be great if your husband
could be better informed

16:41.896 --> 16:44.232
about all we're trying
to accomplish here.

16:44.315 --> 16:45.859
Here's a list.

16:47.985 --> 16:50.405
(MAN CHATTERING ON PA)

16:53.533 --> 16:54.868
Of course.

16:56.244 --> 16:58.413
I would be happy to make
sure he's up to speed.

16:59.622 --> 17:02.667
I mean, that would only
serve all of us, right?

17:03.084 --> 17:04.085
That's right.

17:04.167 --> 17:05.252
But, you know,

17:05.336 --> 17:08.423
I'm not the only one who's
been talking to Larry.

17:08.506 --> 17:10.633
Counselor Healy
has spoken with him.

17:11.050 --> 17:13.261
Why was Healy speaking
to your husband?

17:13.678 --> 17:15.221
He called to tell him
I was having

17:15.304 --> 17:17.598
a lesbian affair
with another inmate.

17:18.223 --> 17:19.559
Oh, good Christ.

17:19.642 --> 17:21.394
No, no, that's okay.

17:22.645 --> 17:25.898
It's probably just another
case of misinformation.

17:27.608 --> 17:28.902
What's your angle, Chapman?

17:29.110 --> 17:33.281
You know, you keep referring
to Larry as my husband?

17:33.448 --> 17:36.534
But we're not married yet.
Though we do hope to be.

17:37.159 --> 17:40.580
So, that means, I need a
marriage request form,

17:40.663 --> 17:43.875
and, of course, your approval.

17:45.251 --> 17:50.465
And I would be happy to make
sure that my new husband

17:51.090 --> 17:53.843
is up to speed with all of the

great work you're
doing here at Litchfield.

arrange something.

Fuckin' perv.

My mother hit him with a brick
when he messed with my niece once.

the Silent One nearby?

19:05.247 --> 19:08.209
Out back. But not too long,
'cause they got work to do.

All right.

your names for Secret Santa.

you again, it's a secret,

so don't go blabbing
all over camp.

19:21.180 --> 19:23.683
If you pick your own name, just
put it back and pull again.

Really?

19:29.022 --> 19:30.064

19:30.147 --> 19:33.192
No, not yet.
How's she doing?

19:33.359 --> 19:36.362
She wouldn't leave the cube this morning.
She won't show up for work.

gonna throw you

don't go to work,"

look that makes my ass leak.

I am familiar with that look.

19:44.537 --> 19:46.080

Heard you broke up
with your girl.

23:21.503 --> 23:24.632
Wow. Twitter's got
nothing on prison.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.341
You feel bad?

23:27.051 --> 23:28.928
I feel like I did
what I needed to do.

23:29.804 --> 23:30.888
She mad?

23:31.139 --> 23:32.140
Yep.

23:32.265 --> 23:34.642
Mad enough to leave
a dead rat on your locker?

23:34.725 --> 23:35.893
What?

23:37.310 --> 23:38.437
Whoa!

23:38.520 --> 23:41.023
What the fuck? No, no,
no, she didn't do that.

23:41.149 --> 23:43.692
Do you think that that thing
just crawled up here and died?

23:43.818 --> 23:46.154
No. This a message rat.

23:46.279 --> 23:48.321
Someone say they
gonna kill you.

23:48.405 --> 23:49.448
Say it right here.

23:49.991 --> 23:56.831
See, they meant "you're," apostrophe R-E.
As in, you are gonna die.

23:56.914 --> 23:59.332
But this some
ignorant bitch-ass shit.

23:59.458 --> 24:01.002
What's an Amalekite?

24:01.127 --> 24:02.711
I think it's some Bible stuff.

24:02.837 --> 24:05.006
Hey, yo, Black Cindy.
Come here.

24:05.173 --> 24:07.967
Stuff. I bet this was that
crazy fucking hillbilly.

24:08.092 --> 24:09.177
What's up?

24:09.302 --> 24:11.804
- You was raised in the church, right?
- I was,

24:13.764 --> 24:15.266
but like my daddy say...

24:15.348 --> 24:21.354
<i>The Lord don't take</i>
<i>the wuzzers into the kingdom</i>

24:21.480 --> 24:25.776
<i>He take the izzers Yeah!</i>

24:25.860 --> 24:27.778
(VOCALIZING)

24:27.862 --> 24:29.780
Uh, so what's an Amalekite?

24:30.614 --> 24:31.740
- Amalekite?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:31.866 --> 24:35.536
Oh, they real baddies in the Bible.
Attackin' everybody.

24:35.661 --> 24:38.539
Preying on the weak and shit.
A war tribe.

24:38.956 --> 24:43.336
Ooh, in Samuel, God told
Saul to kill 'em all.

24:43.418 --> 24:44.419
(GRUNTS)

24:44.545 --> 24:47.882
Utterly destroy them motherfuckers.
That what God say.

24:47.965 --> 24:51.344
Even the babies.
Even the cows.

24:52.053 --> 24:53.888
They so bad their
cows had to die.

24:54.513 --> 24:55.723
Say anything about rats?

24:56.515 --> 24:57.725
No. Mmm-mmm.

24:58.433 --> 25:00.728
Okay, this is nuts.

25:00.853 --> 25:01.937
It is.

25:02.355 --> 25:03.731
I have to tell someone.

25:04.565 --> 25:07.776
Right. 'Cause
COs love trouble.

25:08.194 --> 25:10.279
Man, you say something,

25:10.403 --> 25:12.740
they gonna put you in Seg
"for your own protection,"

25:12.823 --> 25:14.575
just so they ain't gotta deal.

25:14.658 --> 25:16.077
True, true.

25:16.202 --> 25:19.705
You gotta handle this yourself.
Straight up. Cut.

25:19.788 --> 25:20.998
(IMITATES CUTTING)

25:21.414 --> 25:22.615
Well, what am I supposed to do?

25:22.624 --> 25:24.752
Kill that
motherfucker. Out.

25:30.507 --> 25:32.260
I seen dead everything.

25:32.343 --> 25:34.220
Did you explain to
her about the inventory?

25:34.303 --> 25:36.931
That protein order has
to last into next month.

25:37.056 --> 25:38.140
I'll come back and
there will be nothing

25:38.266 --> 25:39.641
but scraps for me to work with.

25:39.767 --> 25:41.143
They all talk Spanish
when we're around.

25:41.269 --> 25:43.271
(SIGHS) Listen, Jesus.

25:43.436 --> 25:45.940
She may have fed
a <i>quinceanera</i> or two,

25:46.023 --> 25:47.858
but this will catch up
with her soon enough.

25:47.942 --> 25:50.443
Feeding an entire
prison population day in

25:50.569 --> 25:52.613
and day out is a whole
other pot of fish stew

25:52.696 --> 25:54.447
and when she
starts to drown in it,

25:54.573 --> 25:56.174
we'll be the ones
who will pay the price.

25:56.284 --> 25:59.745
It'll take us weeks to put
everything back into working order.

26:00.288 --> 26:02.164
This is what I need you to do.

26:02.957 --> 26:04.959
Speed up the inevitable.

26:06.335 --> 26:08.254
Overcook, over-salt.

26:08.461 --> 26:10.131
We need the inmates to revolt.

26:10.298 --> 26:12.216
Red, we're
on the B-team.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.218
We don't go anywhere
near food prep anymore.

26:14.302 --> 26:16.637
She's got us
stacking boxes, serving...

26:17.305 --> 26:19.265
Well, start serving
very slowly then.

26:19.348 --> 26:21.809
The meal times will
be all screwed up.

26:21.934 --> 26:23.476
It'll throw the whole camp off.

26:23.978 --> 26:25.146
Yeah, I don't know.

26:25.229 --> 26:27.440
I mean, she runs a pretty
tight ship, right, Norma?

26:27.522 --> 26:28.649
I don't think
we'll get away with it.

26:28.774 --> 26:31.193
Don't think, Gina.
Just do it.

26:31.319 --> 26:34.363
You want to be stacking boxes
for the rest of your stay?

26:34.487 --> 26:36.740
You listen to
what I'm telling you,

26:36.824 --> 26:38.659
you need to fuck
with that kitchen.

26:38.784 --> 26:39.865
You fuck with this kitchen,

26:39.868 --> 26:40.911
I'll have you
outta here so fast

26:40.995 --> 26:41.996
you'll think your
ass grew wheels.

26:42.121 --> 26:43.496
Hey, we just wanna
do a good job.

26:43.580 --> 26:45.874
Yeah? Then why you in here
sniffin' around the dry goods

26:46.000 --> 26:48.252
when I asked you to wipe
down the service station?

26:49.253 --> 26:53.174
Yeah, yeah, yeah, <i>mira,</i> I got four
kids, I know every trick there is.

26:53.841 --> 26:56.677
Now, I kept you here
'cause you know your shit.

26:57.386 --> 26:59.512
It's not your fault
that Red lost the kitchen.

26:59.638 --> 27:02.641
But we all know this
is one of the good jobs.

27:02.850 --> 27:05.019
Don't let Red take
you down with her.

27:07.688 --> 27:09.064
<i>Vamos,</i> let's go.

27:09.482 --> 27:11.524
PIPER: <i>Maybe she's just</i>
<i>trying to engage me.</i>

27:11.650 --> 27:15.154
She says that thing about the
Amalekites, piques my interest,

27:15.237 --> 27:18.282
and then she can get me to
go to Bible study group.

27:18.531 --> 27:19.700
(POUSSEY SCOFFING)

27:19.825 --> 27:21.035
She's a weird girl.

27:21.118 --> 27:23.400
- Yeah. "You gonna die" was really vague.
- BLACK CINDY: Ha!

27:23.454 --> 27:25.498
Like, totally open
to interpretation.

27:25.831 --> 27:29.043
You know that tweakhead is coming
for you, you better prepare.

27:29.126 --> 27:31.628
All right, listen,
chick steps up,

27:32.087 --> 27:33.881
kick her straight in the cooch.

27:33.964 --> 27:36.050
Hurts just as much on
girls as it do on guys.

27:36.175 --> 27:37.301
ALL: Mmm-hmm.

27:37.385 --> 27:39.720
Yeah, yeah, but if you
punchin', you go for the nose.

27:39.803 --> 27:41.180
Biff! Swap!
You know what I mean?

27:41.347 --> 27:44.599
I still say the pookacha.
Shot to the twat.

27:45.434 --> 27:47.144
Yo! Then, when
she doubled over,

27:47.269 --> 27:49.021
elbow straight to the back.
Like... (YELLS)

27:49.230 --> 27:51.482
- Bitch out!
- What? Gone!

27:51.564 --> 27:53.359
Pow, pow, pow,
pow! Whomp!

(WOMEN CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)

27:55.861 --> 27:58.322
Okay, come on,
you guys, come on!

27:58.406 --> 28:00.824
With Red, I just had to come
up with a creative solution.

28:00.908 --> 28:02.701
So, maybe we should think
along those lines.

28:04.245 --> 28:06.080
Figure out something
she really needs.

28:07.415 --> 28:08.999
What is something
that she really needs?

28:09.417 --> 28:10.418
ALL: New teeth!

28:10.959 --> 28:12.378

- BLACK CINDY: This is jacked up! Bitches in heat.
- POUSSEY: Yo.

28:21.011 --> 28:22.930
- He's in love with you.
- What are you talking about?

28:23.013 --> 28:25.140
Mendez. He's madly
in love with you.

28:25.433 --> 28:26.767
Clearly you gave
an amazing performance,

28:26.892 --> 28:29.562
because the man
is head over heels.

28:29.644 --> 28:31.105
Unless it wasn't a performance.

28:31.272 --> 28:33.107
- You think I liked it?
- I don't know.

28:33.232 --> 28:35.943
All I know is that he sure did
and I had to hear all about it,

28:36.026 --> 28:37.652
and now I can
barely look at you.

28:37.778 --> 28:40.489
John, it's our baby.

28:41.073 --> 28:42.657
Well, it can go
live with George.

28:42.783 --> 28:44.452
- Who's George?
- Mendez!

28:47.121 --> 28:48.372
(INAUDIBLE)

28:51.500 --> 28:53.085
He'll think it's
his love child anyway.

28:54.628 --> 28:56.671
(SIGHS) I'll ask him
to get a DNA test.

28:56.797 --> 28:58.006
Then they'll fire me.

28:58.132 --> 28:59.967
They're not gonna
know it's yours.

29:00.092 --> 29:01.885
They'll just know it's not his.

29:01.969 --> 29:03.929
Then Cesar will pick it
up from the hospital

29:04.012 --> 29:05.180
and he'll bring it to you.

29:05.306 --> 29:06.307
If the test
proves it's not his,

29:06.432 --> 29:08.350
they're gonna want to know how
you got pregnant in prison,

29:08.476 --> 29:12.480
and then we're back to where we started.
Daya, it was a bad plan.

29:12.729 --> 29:14.440
And you had sex with him.

29:15.649 --> 29:18.777
John, I love you.

29:20.154 --> 29:21.822
I hate him.

I only love you.
You gotta know that.

29:47.014 --> 29:49.683
what my favorite color is
and if my feet get cold.

29:53.061 --> 29:54.522
If I was making you slippers,

29:54.771 --> 29:57.107
which I am not,
I wouldn't be anymore.

cold feet that ain't magenta!

impressive for a junkie.

30:17.044 --> 30:19.046
Well, yeah, that's with drugs.

30:19.129 --> 30:20.172
Look, you gotta remember,

30:20.255 --> 30:22.799
I had a mom who sent me to
overnight camp when I was three.

I have mastered the art
of shutting people off.

into training with you.

30:31.684 --> 30:35.854
Sucks. I'm sorry, kid.

little prayer that she gets fat

30:40.859 --> 30:42.777
and stops shaving her legs?

30:44.446 --> 30:45.573

I'm so happy for you.

30:59.836 --> 31:02.423
Look, he didn't
write anything else.

31:02.590 --> 31:06.594
But that's his signature. My wife
didn't fake-sign it for him this time.

That's something. I just
wish he'd talk to me.

about this part for me?

you fucking kidding me?

Surprised me, too. She never
used to be the aggressor.

I guess it was a new color
she was trying on.

33:33.741 --> 33:35.784

WOMAN: Shut the fuck up.

53:11.250 --> 53:15.379
Joseph, I'm not
feeling very well.

53:15.462 --> 53:19.508
I'm really tired
and I have a pain.

53:19.592 --> 53:22.595
I think it's time for
the baby to be born!

53:23.846 --> 53:29.685
Please, Mary, lie down here on
this nice bed I made in the straw.

53:30.269 --> 53:32.605
Oh, yeah, lay down, Mary!

53:33.188 --> 53:34.815
(ALL LAUGHING)

Jesus fucking Christ!

53:40.362 --> 53:43.365
All right, ladies. Knock it off!
Knock it off!

53:47.036 --> 53:49.204
Joseph, you were saying?

53:49.413 --> 53:50.957
That should have
been us up there.

53:51.122 --> 53:52.165
I know.

53:52.917 --> 53:56.670
Lie down, Mary,
it won't be long now.

Hey! Hey! Where you
think you're going?

56:32.534 --> 56:34.411
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

56:34.494 --> 56:38.331
You do not wanna fight with me
right now, crazy. You do not.

56:38.540 --> 56:39.917
Oh, no?

56:40.042 --> 56:41.961
Maybe you're right.
I don't wanna fight you.

56:42.920 --> 56:44.838
I wanna end you right now.

56:50.136 --> 56:52.554
You better stop. Mr. Healy's
right over there.

56:52.638 --> 56:53.806
Hi, Mr. Healy.

56:54.932 --> 56:59.352
Mr. Healy! Mr. Healy! Mr. Healy!

57:18.664 --> 57:19.999
Oh!

57:20.124 --> 57:21.917
Look what you
brought out to play.

57:22.001 --> 57:24.253
You back the fuck off me!

57:24.461 --> 57:26.839
You think I'm scared
of you? Do you?

57:28.090 --> 57:31.844
I'm not scared of you.
'Cause I got God by my side.

57:32.511 --> 57:33.512
(YELLS)

57:33.679 --> 57:36.640
And he told me that you
ain't worth nothin'! See?

57:37.808 --> 57:39.601
See how he just
works through me?

57:39.810 --> 57:42.062
And he wants me to smite you.

57:43.314 --> 57:44.523
I see things.

57:50.863 --> 57:53.324
Hmm, she-devil.
That's what you are.

57:53.406 --> 57:56.869
You're the devil,
and I'm the angel of God.

57:56.994 --> 58:02.208
I mean, look at my dress. Have you seen it?
How's that for poetry?

58:02.916 --> 58:03.917
Hmm?

58:04.043 --> 58:06.670
'Cause God loves me.
He don't love you.

58:06.753 --> 58:08.421
'Cause you ain't
worthy of God's love,

58:08.547 --> 58:10.341
you ain't worthy
of nobody's love.

58:11.717 --> 58:13.052
(SHUDDERING)

58:14.469 --> 58:18.598
So I think it's
time that you die.
