WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.742
Previously onSalvation...I created Tess.

00:03.786 --> 00:07.616
Wecreated Tess, and you tried
to smuggle out her source code,

00:07.659 --> 00:08.660
but I caught you.

00:08.704 --> 00:11.446
Youdestroyed my reputation.

00:11.489 --> 00:14.014
DARIUS:
You did that on your own.

00:14.057 --> 00:17.800
Too many casualties. It's time
to stop the war, Alycia.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.107
Where's Alycia?Packed her bags and fled.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.109
Problem for another day.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.632
We're gonna construct
a solar sail.

00:23.675 --> 00:26.113
We'll blow the asteroid
off its course like a...

00:26.156 --> 00:28.115
a sailboat catching
an ocean breeze.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.073
The solar sail
is almost ready for launch.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.989
All it needs is a ride up there,
the right weather conditions.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.209
Glad that I could see
my granddaughter off.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.819
Her first trip to Africa.

00:36.862 --> 00:37.820
GRACE:
My father's in prison

00:37.863 --> 00:39.561
for a crime I committed.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.824
BASS:
What's important
isn't the time.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.086
It's our time together.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.392
You're special.

00:44.435 --> 00:45.610
Can you accept

00:45.654 --> 00:47.612
that you have a purpose?I can.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.266
Have you tried unburdening?

00:49.310 --> 00:51.442
It's what our members do to show

00:51.486 --> 00:53.488
that they've truly
accepted the end.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.403
This group-- COPE-- I think
they're a suicide cult,

00:55.446 --> 00:57.144
and Jillian's with them.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.494
Who do you work for?
Q-17.

00:59.537 --> 01:02.323
The Bureau's best theory is
that some time in the late '80s,

01:02.366 --> 01:04.107
17 of the world's
wealthiest magnates

01:04.151 --> 01:05.500
pooled their resources together

01:05.543 --> 01:06.675
to further their own
self-interests.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.024
GRACE:
They formed Q-17

01:08.068 --> 01:09.678
as their own personal CIA

01:09.721 --> 01:11.506
to meddle in governments,
foment rebellion,

01:11.549 --> 01:13.073
assassinate presidents.

01:13.116 --> 01:16.163
Why do you think you're
here? We put you here.

01:16.206 --> 01:19.166
They killed Mackenzie
so I'd be president.

01:19.209 --> 01:21.429
I can't blur the lines anymore.
I'm sorry.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.039
I can't pardon your father.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.172
I'm gonna use all the power
of the presidency

01:25.215 --> 01:28.958
to destroy you
and your filthy cabal.

What happened, Darius?
Did the FBI find her?

02:57.481 --> 02:59.266
Did they
track her down?
No, but I did.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.659
Where is she?Right here.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.664
Jillian, you're okay.

03:06.708 --> 03:10.190
Uh, Darius said you were
concerned about my well-being.

03:10.233 --> 03:14.019
There's no need to be. I'm fine.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.807
You think I'm crazy.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.679
Let's go with concerned.

03:21.723 --> 03:25.509
Liam, the solar sail
is launching in 48 hours.

03:25.553 --> 03:29.687
I need you to focus
on that, not this.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.385
Understood.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.517
Harris.
HARRIS:
Mr. President,

03:33.561 --> 03:34.692
we've got her.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.520
Time for a reunion.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.914
Hey.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.179
Are you trying to get me fired?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.660
I'm sorry. I was...
I was worried about you.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.052
No, the-the way
you were talking

03:47.096 --> 03:49.403
about giving things up--
that terrified me.

03:49.446 --> 03:52.232
See, fear-- that's your issue,
Liam, it's not mine.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.321
You know, Buddhists they give up
all of their possessions,

03:54.364 --> 03:55.713
and nobody calls them crazy.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.759
I saw everyone
preparing for the end.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.239
I thought you
were in danger.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.241
I know exactly
what I'm doing, Liam.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.677
You're the danger.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.070
What?

04:05.114 --> 04:08.204
Yeah, I think it's best
if you don't contact me anymore.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.946
Ji...

04:19.084 --> 04:21.609
Anyone home

04:21.652 --> 04:24.916
Zoe. Oh, my God. Baby.

04:26.614 --> 04:29.312
Oh, I missed you.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.880
I've only been
gone two months.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.316
Two and a half months.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.883
Oh, it felt like an eternity.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.278
'Cause so much
has happened?

04:38.321 --> 04:40.367
Too much.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.934
Come on. I want
to hear everything.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.154
ZOE:
Giraffes and gazelles would

04:45.197 --> 04:48.462
literally wander past the window
in the middle of the class.

04:48.505 --> 04:51.116
Sounds amazing. Yeah?
It was.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.770
Honey, with all
the chaos going on,

04:52.814 --> 04:55.817
I was surprised when you called
to say you were coming back.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.951
Homesick, I guess.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.476
I miss my family.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.610
I missed you.

05:06.654 --> 05:07.959
I was actually, uh, thinking

05:08.003 --> 05:09.787
we could maybe see
Grandma and Grandpa tonight

05:09.831 --> 05:11.615
for a little reunion dinner?

05:11.659 --> 05:13.965
Uh... they're
out of town.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.144
Hello.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.146
MAN:
Congratulations.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.974
I see your daughter is home.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.065
Excuse me?

05:27.109 --> 05:30.330
It would be a shame
if something happened to her.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.375
Who is this?

05:35.683 --> 05:38.425
Mom, who was that?

05:39.469 --> 05:41.471
Very nice.

05:41.515 --> 05:45.606
Our president will
fall in line now, and quickly.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.542
Ugh.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.851
What, are you
here to gloat?

06:13.895 --> 06:15.897
No.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.379
To offer you a deal.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.383
Well, that implies
I have something you need.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.387
The dark money that's
infiltrated our government

06:27.430 --> 06:29.563
is a cancer to this country,
not to mention

06:29.606 --> 06:31.739
the rest of the world,
and I intend

06:31.782 --> 06:34.437
to destroy those responsible...

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
with your help.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.749
Why the hell would I help you
with anything?

06:41.792 --> 06:43.141
Because

06:43.185 --> 06:45.579
for once, you and are
on the same side.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.624
Ideologically.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.327
And I need the best hacker
in the world

06:55.371 --> 06:57.242
to pull off something
this brazen

06:57.286 --> 06:59.984
and audacious.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.160
I'm listening.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.949
We're gonna steal
their money.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.170
All of it.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.784
They started a war,
and we're gonna finish it.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.135
♪

07:34.454 --> 07:36.325
Zoe's in the country
less than three hours,

07:36.368 --> 07:38.501
and they knew she was here.The FBI is tracing the call.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.547
Hopefully connect it
with Q-17.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.592
Don't hold your breath.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.464
They probably used a burner.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.509
I don't care what he used.
I'm not gonna sit by and wait

07:46.553 --> 07:48.729
for whoever it was
to show his face.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.426
I'm hiring security.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.124
Around-the-clock protection,
former Mossad if I have to.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.300
HARRIS: Okay, Grace, we'll
get you the best, I promise.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.477
Those bastards aren't getting
within a thousand yards of Zoe.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.522
I'll make sure of it.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.612
How?I'll watch her myself.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.006
Grace, that's
actually a good idea.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.704
Alonzo and I have been doing
a deep dive into Q-17.

08:07.748 --> 08:10.011
We can't take any chances. We
need to keep the circle tight.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.317
Right now we don't know
who we could trust.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.668
I can't ask you to be
her bodyguard, Alonzo.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.191
You're not asking.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.019
I'm volunteering.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.847
Like I said, you're on my beat.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.806
Harris.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.678
Hey, Zoe.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.854
Welcome back.

08:26.897 --> 08:30.553
Zoe, this is Detective
Alonzo Carter.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.644
Mom, what is going on?

08:34.688 --> 08:36.559
I did not come all the way

08:36.603 --> 08:38.387
back here
to be a prisoner in my home.

08:38.430 --> 08:39.867
Zo, I know this
isn't optimal.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.869
I will sort it out,
I promise, but for now

08:41.912 --> 08:43.566
I need you to stay
put with Alonzo.

08:43.610 --> 08:46.003
Please, it's for your safety.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.788
All right.

08:53.054 --> 08:56.884
TESS:
Stage one propulsion nominal.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.234
Approaching max Q.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.108
Run it again. Vary the wind
speed up and down the line.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.241
Weather conditions are
predicted to be favorable.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.765
Wind speed less
than 12 knots.Yeah.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.114
But we don't need any surprises.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.987
Speaking of surprises.

09:24.389 --> 09:27.305
LIAM:
You made a deal with her?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.438
What are you
thinking, Darius?

09:29.481 --> 09:32.963
I'm bringing in the world's best
hacker to steal Q-17's assets.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.313
She's not going free.
She's working for me.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.925
But how can we trust her
after everything she's done?I don't.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.275
Ms. Vrettou won't be venturing
outside her cubicle. I've got

09:40.318 --> 09:42.625
NSA cyber security experts
mirror-monitoring

09:42.669 --> 09:44.322
her every keystroke.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.151
Not to mention
an ankle bracelet for insurance.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.112
Seriously?

09:51.155 --> 09:53.201
Q-17 must be stopped, Liam.

09:53.244 --> 09:56.073
The enemy of my enemy...
is my friend.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.509
Well, she's not mine.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.468
As president,
I have many concerns.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.644
Right now you have one--
the solar sail.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.995
This is our best launch window.
We need to make it!

10:05.039 --> 10:06.780
We will.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.738
Grace, what's the matter?

10:08.782 --> 10:10.610
Hey, Dad, it's me.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.568
I'm back.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.179
Yeah, me, too.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.617
Uh, I want to see you.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.488
Well, you could
come over for lunch.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.885
I mean tomorrow.

10:24.928 --> 10:27.235
Yeah, yeah, maybe tomorrow.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.585
Okay, let's plan for that.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.674
Yeah, I love you, too.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.852
This is insane.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.680
Now I can't even see
my own father?

10:37.724 --> 10:40.944
You don't want him
in the line of fire.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.337
The line of fire?Mm-hmm.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.252
Why the hell
did I even come back here?

10:44.295 --> 10:45.862
I'm just so sick of...

10:49.736 --> 10:52.303
Hey, you all right?

10:53.827 --> 10:56.612
Uh... the malaria pills.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.919
I'm fine.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.275
It's Uncle Nick. His
fingerprints are all over it.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.625
He clearly knows about us.He's threatening you
to get to me.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
I don't care what
the reason is.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.542
I won't let my daughter
be collateral damage

11:13.585 --> 11:14.978
in your family's blood feud.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.851
I'll send extra security
to your house.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.504
Darius, these people
kill for sport.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.984
If anything happens to Zoe...

11:21.028 --> 11:22.377
It won't.You don't know that!

11:22.420 --> 11:24.509
They killed Mackenzie
and a host of others.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.163
These people will
stop at nothing.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.732
This is my fault.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.735
I'm gonna make this right
if it's the last thing I do.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.171
You don't want extra security.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.521
Well, what

11:37.784 --> 11:39.829
Accept my resignation.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.398
And arrange to have Zoe
flown out of the country

11:43.441 --> 11:45.748
with me tomorrow.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.359
Grace.

11:48.403 --> 11:49.883
I've had enough.

11:51.536 --> 11:54.409
Just let me go. Please.

11:57.542 --> 12:01.242
I'll have an airplane ready
at a discreet airstrip tomorrow.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.461
Thanks.

12:12.470 --> 12:16.257
Harris. Any luck
with that cell phone trace?

12:16.300 --> 12:19.303
Not yet. We're running it,
and the FBI's all over it.

12:19.347 --> 12:22.654
I want the feds
to bring in Nicholas Tanz

12:22.698 --> 12:24.656
dead or alive.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.267
We don't have a warrant yet,

12:26.310 --> 12:27.921
or anything tangible
to hang on him.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.402
I don't give a damn.
Do you?

12:37.147 --> 12:39.280
He's not worthy
of you, Jillian.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.804
Nate is right. Not everyone has
the clarity of mind

12:41.848 --> 12:43.806
to see through the fear
like you do.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.808
Well, that's because
of you, Bass.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.463
You've showed me that distrust--
it's a natural response

12:48.506 --> 12:51.553
people feel when they see
other people at peace.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.685
Liam was brainwashed by
a terrorist organization.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.992
He's the one who
can't be trusted.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.386
I know that, and yet...

12:58.429 --> 13:01.041
You feel a deep sense of loss.

13:01.084 --> 13:04.479
For him, us,
all that we had.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.569
And I can't help that I still
have feelings for him.

13:07.612 --> 13:10.006
Processing betrayal
takes time.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.488
Thank you for being
such a guiding light for me.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.403
Then maybe you can
be a guiding light

13:15.446 --> 13:16.796
for the rest of us.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.059
People have lost hope, Jillian,

13:19.102 --> 13:22.497
but I believe youcan
help them get it back.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.900
I see you managed

13:33.943 --> 13:35.727
to get Tess up and running.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.642
Back from the dead.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.472
You're not the only
coder on the planet.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.692
You know, she's more complicated
than you think.

13:43.735 --> 13:44.911
There's nuances.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.173
There's...She's fine.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.914
Okay.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.699
I designed the simulation
you're running with Tess,

13:50.742 --> 13:52.483
so if you have any problems...

13:52.527 --> 13:53.833
There's no problem.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.225
All good.You know, I don't know why

13:55.269 --> 13:56.661
you're in such a mood.

13:56.705 --> 13:57.880
You're free.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.534
I'm the one
who's a prisoner here.

13:59.577 --> 14:02.754
Well, now you know what it's
like being held captive.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.192
What's the matter?

14:05.235 --> 14:07.368
No tearful reunion
with your girlfriend, Jillian?

14:07.411 --> 14:09.761
Screw you.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.421
What's that?

14:17.465 --> 14:19.380
That is the sound of headway.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.164
I've just discovered

14:21.208 --> 14:24.385
Q-17's buried treasure.
Oh, Nicholas.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.343
You've been a naughty boy,
doing business

14:26.387 --> 14:28.606
with dictators.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.567
We converted the American
dollars to the yen

14:32.610 --> 14:34.917
before funding the
mining operation.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.180
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Tanz.

14:37.224 --> 14:40.749
I apologize, but the card
you gave us was denied.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.056
Huh. That's impossible.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.493
:
They don't deny me anything.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.671
Perhaps you'd like
to make a call.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.416
:
Oh, these Q-17 bastards

14:55.459 --> 14:56.939
are in for the ride

14:56.983 --> 14:59.246
of their lives.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.381
And how would they get access?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.740
Everything all right, sir?

15:15.784 --> 15:18.439
I'm taking you off the leash.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.921
Do what needs to be done.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.314
Now.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.935
HARRIS: The target is
Nicholas Tanz, people.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.067
Every airport, every airstrip,
every highway.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.417
I want eyes on everything
and anything.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.766
We picked Alycia Vrettou
out of a haystack.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.986
We should be able to
find Nicholas Tanz.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.857
He exited a restaurant
less than two hours ago

15:45.901 --> 15:47.337
in a Bentley.We're doing everything we can

15:47.381 --> 15:49.122
to find him, Mr. President.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.863
Why does it always sound
ironic when you say that?

16:00.263 --> 16:01.569
What?

16:01.612 --> 16:03.005
No.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.747
No.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.837
What the...?

16:08.880 --> 16:09.969
No!

16:14.712 --> 16:16.540
Yes?

16:16.584 --> 16:18.194
Darius? Uh...

16:18.238 --> 16:19.369
slight problem.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.503
Actually, huge.
Um, they're onto us.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.809
I'm on my way. Don't
touch anything.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.202
Not a thing.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.380
Harris, we need to talk.About Nicholas Tanz?

16:30.424 --> 16:33.035
Yes, I'm aware we don't
have a warrant yet.No.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.384
This is about Hugh Keating.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.038
Grace Barrows' father.
Former CIA.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.909
We've had him in holding.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.390
He confessed to killing
Claire Rayburn.Yes, I know.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.740
What the hell happened?

16:56.189 --> 16:58.234
Grace?

16:59.714 --> 17:01.585
What's wrong?

17:11.291 --> 17:13.075
Stabbed.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.078
My father.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.949
Fortunately, they missed
his vital organs.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.300
He's getting proper medical
care. He's gonna be okay.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.476
This time.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.131
They're coming after me, Harris.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.610
And my family.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.960
They know how much
you mean to Darius.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.440
I have to...

17:30.484 --> 17:32.486
I need to move my father
to safety before they try again.

17:32.529 --> 17:33.965
I've already asked
Director Davis

17:34.009 --> 17:35.097
to get Hugh extra protection

17:35.141 --> 17:36.707
and a more secure facility.No. No.

17:36.751 --> 17:39.319
That's not enough.

17:39.362 --> 17:42.061
I'm leaving the country

17:42.104 --> 17:43.845
with Zoe first thing
in the morning.What?

17:43.888 --> 17:46.108
Darius arranged for a plane.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.328
I want my father

17:48.371 --> 17:50.634
to come with us, but I can't
do it without your help.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.071
Grace, I can't make
that kind of move

17:52.114 --> 17:53.463
without a presidential pardon.

17:53.507 --> 17:54.812
He already turned me down once.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.076
I can't go back to him on this.You're asking me

17:57.119 --> 17:58.468
to violate
a presidential order.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.905
Harris, my father
has risked his life

18:00.949 --> 18:03.386
for this country more
times than we can count.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.697
God, Grace.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.700
All right.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.139
The less you know, the better.

18:17.183 --> 18:21.100
But your father will be
on that plane with you and Zoe.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.840
Thank you.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.976
:
I'm gonna miss you, Grace.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.022
I'm gonna miss you.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.989
I have to go.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.034
I have to go tell Zoe.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.534
D-Don't shoot.
I-I live here.

19:04.578 --> 19:05.709
Detective Carter.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.582
Jillian Hayes. Yeah, we've met.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.671
We haven't.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.412
Zoe.Oh.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.892
Uh, welcome home.

19:14.936 --> 19:17.504
What's happening?

19:17.547 --> 19:19.375
That's unacceptable.
Those accounts

19:19.419 --> 19:21.551
did not just get sucked
into a giant black hole.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.205
They are somewhere.ALYCIA:
Yes.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.120
In some sort
of financial panic room, okay?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.862
And I've tried every trick
in the book to find it.Not every trick.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.124
I'd be staring
at my uncle's accounts

19:29.168 --> 19:30.908
this very second if you had.Hey.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.562
You can blame me
for a lot of crap,

19:32.606 --> 19:34.042
but not this one.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.087
I mean, your uncle
and his cronies, man,

19:36.131 --> 19:38.220
they're next

19:38.264 --> 19:42.224
They must have some separate
network that's untraceable.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.227
Next-level.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.751
Untraceable. Follow me.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.757
Death threats?
That's terrifying.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.977
Yeah. I thought I was coming
back to a home-cooked meal.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.761
Instead I'm a prisoner
in my own home,

19:57.805 --> 19:59.285
under 24/7 watch.

19:59.328 --> 20:02.113
Yeah, well,
the world's changed, Zoe.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.419
It's hard to see
through the fear

20:03.463 --> 20:05.160
and have clarity of mind.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.597
It is.Yeah.

20:07.641 --> 20:10.296
But you seem calm.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.776
I've learned to accept
what I can't change.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.780
:
Oh, the tea.

20:16.824 --> 20:17.781
Do you want some?

20:17.825 --> 20:19.261
Sure.
Okay.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.483
TESS: Solar sail
launch simulation beginning

20:23.526 --> 20:27.443
in five, four, three, two...

20:29.880 --> 20:32.056
Vehicle is supersonic.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.583
Wind levels gusting
above 30 knots.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.454
Attempting to compensate.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.113
Crap. What just happened?

20:45.156 --> 20:46.810
Simulation failed.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.160
Catastrophic failure
at 49 seconds.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.510
Run it again.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.163
How did we miss this?

20:53.208 --> 20:55.428
We didn't.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.865
Updated forecast.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.997
The winds changed.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.308
ALYCIA:
This was implanted...

21:06.352 --> 21:07.614
DARIUS:
Inside a woman's neck.

21:07.657 --> 21:10.399
A Q-17 assassin, to be precise.
It's a tracker

21:10.443 --> 21:11.966
and a biometric monitor.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.403
Not one of your
designs, I take it?No, black market.

21:14.447 --> 21:17.014
Untraceable.What's that gold marking?

21:18.538 --> 21:20.322
At first I thought
it was just a tracker.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.802
But what if...

21:21.845 --> 21:24.631
it's much more than that?

21:24.674 --> 21:28.156
A micro-antenna, say,

21:28.199 --> 21:32.552
connected to a private encrypted
global satellite network.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.858
Where Q-17 can hide
their wealth away

21:34.902 --> 21:36.512
from prying eyes
and governments.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.691
If that's an antenna,
I can get you in.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.932
Okay.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.803
Okay.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.632
You've got their biometrics?

22:17.684 --> 22:19.294
There it is.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.861
Q-17's private network.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.564
:
It's all there.

22:28.608 --> 22:29.826
DARIUS:
Brilliant.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.654
All their holdings,
all their bank accounts.

22:31.698 --> 22:34.135
And now
for the pièce de résistance.

22:34.178 --> 22:35.354
Which is?

22:35.397 --> 22:38.182
Steal it. Steal all of it.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.533
With pleasure.

22:44.493 --> 22:47.148
That's over $21 billion.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.454
Now...

22:48.497 --> 22:51.021
where to hide it all?

22:51.065 --> 22:53.328
Allow me to do the honors.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.287
Even after all this, you
still don't trust me, huh?

22:56.331 --> 22:57.941
Well, let's just let Uncle Sam

22:57.985 --> 22:59.595
hold onto it for safekeeping.

22:59.639 --> 23:00.857
LIAM:
Darius.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.859
We got a problem.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.339
The winds have changed.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.297
Tess is saying we need
to abandon the launch window.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.038
What?That might not be true.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.301
What do you mean?

23:10.345 --> 23:11.694
Well, you guys may
have figured out how

23:11.738 --> 23:13.522
to shut Tess down
and reboot her,

23:13.566 --> 23:16.438
but there are nuances
to her code,

23:16.482 --> 23:17.700
things you don't know.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.310
And, look, Tess is my baby.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.443
The solar sail is ours.
Let me help.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.140
We're talking about the fate

23:23.184 --> 23:24.707
of the world here.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.317
Do it.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.319
Hey.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.974
You're burning the midnight oil,
Director Davis.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.933
They found him, sir.
Nicholas Tanz.

23:32.976 --> 23:35.152
He's pulling into
a private airstrip in Virginia.

23:35.196 --> 23:36.719
Take him.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.242
We are still working
on that warrant.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.723
I don't give a damn.
Arrest the son of a bitch now.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.072
Mr. President...

23:42.116 --> 23:43.552
Where's Mr. Secretary?

23:43.596 --> 23:44.901
He had other business
to attend to.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.250
Other business?

23:46.294 --> 23:47.600
Director Davis,

23:47.643 --> 23:49.079
Nicholas Tanz
is personally responsible

23:49.123 --> 23:50.603
for the assassination
of Pauline Mackenzie

23:50.646 --> 23:51.865
and a host of others.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.301
If you allow him
to leave the United States,

23:53.344 --> 23:54.433
you'll be making

23:54.476 --> 23:57.436
the biggest blunder
of your career!

23:59.176 --> 24:01.483
Do it.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.673
Hands where I can see them!

24:17.717 --> 24:19.719
Hands!

24:36.126 --> 24:37.998
You look like you
could use a drink.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.566
More like the entire bottle.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.524
How's everything here?

24:42.568 --> 24:46.006
Uh... yeah.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.921
I mean...

24:47.964 --> 24:49.923
your daughter threw up.

24:49.966 --> 24:52.534
Twice.

24:52.578 --> 24:55.755
[Jillian and Zoe laughing,
talking indistinctly]

24:59.802 --> 25:03.545
Jillian? Uh, I thought

25:03.589 --> 25:04.981
you were moving in with friends.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.461
Oh, I am.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.897
I just came to get
the rest of my things.

25:07.941 --> 25:10.030
Then we got to chatting.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.554
Okay. Do you mind giving me
a minute alone with Zoe, please?

25:12.598 --> 25:15.905
Um, of course.

25:19.909 --> 25:22.259
Mom, that was a little abrupt.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.566
You and I are leaving
first thing in the morning.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.263
What

25:26.307 --> 25:28.222
Somewhere far away.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.919
It's not safe for us here.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.574
Uh, I just got here.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.271
I haven't even seen Grandpa.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.882
He's coming with us.No.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.405
Mom, I'm not going.

25:37.448 --> 25:38.493
I'm 19 years old.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.103
You can't just
order me around anymore.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.366
I'm not ordering you around.
I'm trying to protect you.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.631
Zoe.

25:47.023 --> 25:49.069
Zo. Hey.

25:49.112 --> 25:51.462
Baby
Are you sick?

25:51.506 --> 25:53.160
No.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.466
Zoe.

25:55.510 --> 25:58.469
Look at me.

26:00.297 --> 26:03.518
Oh, my God. You're pregnant.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.350
Who's the father?

26:11.395 --> 26:13.354
He's dead.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.838
Dylan Edwards.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.757
You and Harris are
gonna be grandparents.

26:26.759 --> 26:30.284
How dare you treat me
like a common criminal?

26:30.327 --> 26:32.765
Nothing common
about you, Uncle.

26:32.808 --> 26:36.595
You take criminal behavior
to new heights.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.858
My hands are clean.
I've done nothing wrong.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.337
You can't keep me.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.644
Watch me.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.951
I'm the president, remember?

26:44.994 --> 26:47.867
Oh, yeah. How could I forget?

26:47.910 --> 26:49.869
All you've done

26:49.912 --> 26:52.915
since you, since you took office
is to abuse your power.

26:52.959 --> 26:56.005
Well, I learned from the
very best, didn't I?

26:56.049 --> 26:58.094
Darius, when are you
gonna take responsibility

26:58.138 --> 26:59.705
for who you really are?

26:59.748 --> 27:01.358
You don't follow
the rule of law.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.143
You never have.

27:03.186 --> 27:07.234
You do whatever you want to do
whenever you want to do it.

27:10.237 --> 27:13.980
Because deep down inside...

27:14.023 --> 27:16.722
you know you're just like us.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.988
I have a heart.
Yes.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.990
And that'll always be the
difference between us.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.078
Yeah.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.257
And your downfall.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.012
You should never have
gone after Grace,

27:46.055 --> 27:47.796
but you had to
make it personal.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.319
And that

27:49.363 --> 27:51.800
is your downfall.

27:51.844 --> 27:55.021
You're playing
a dangerous game, Darius.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.197
One you can't even begin
to fathom.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.026
If you don't release me,

28:00.069 --> 28:01.941
they'll replace me
with someone else.

28:03.377 --> 28:06.641
You can't stamp us out.

28:06.685 --> 28:10.863
All you can do
is cooperate with us.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.956
Over my dead body.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.827
Yeah, that can be arranged.

28:22.875 --> 28:27.706
I can make your life
miserable, Uncle...

28:27.749 --> 28:29.838
and I will.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.060
Darius.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.107
I can do the same to you.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.376
Mr. President, a word.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.255
How far along are you?

28:55.298 --> 28:57.213
Ten weeks.

28:57.257 --> 29:00.216
I can't just run off.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.696
Zoe, if you want
to protect yourself

29:01.740 --> 29:03.263
and your baby's future...

29:03.306 --> 29:04.830
We don't even know
if there's gonna be

29:04.873 --> 29:06.092
a future, Mom.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.702
What's gonna save us?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.965
Rail gun or solar sail?

29:10.009 --> 29:11.924
And what if they don't work?

29:11.967 --> 29:14.491
Darius says they will
and I believe him.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.145
And what if I
don't want to go?

29:16.189 --> 29:19.975
Are you gonna have Alonzo
force me at gunpoint?

29:23.109 --> 29:25.589
Zoe, you have a child
to think about now.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.899
Now I'm gonna pack
and so should you.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.780
JILLIAN:
You okay?

29:45.522 --> 29:48.525
The world's
just so messed up.

29:51.746 --> 29:54.880
Zoe, I couldn't help
overhearing.

29:54.923 --> 29:59.058
But if you're looking
for a safe place,

29:59.101 --> 30:01.277
I think I might be able to help.

30:03.323 --> 30:06.152
TESS:
Simulation failed.

30:06.195 --> 30:09.416
The forecast for tomorrow
is 30 knots sustained winds.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.984
But when Tess runs sims
with those numbers,

30:12.027 --> 30:13.681
everything just goes boom.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.379
I programmed the simulation
that you're running.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.251
I was conservative
with my estimates.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.731
I added extra margin for error,
but when the real moment comes,

30:20.775 --> 30:22.995
you can override Tess
up to 40 knots.

30:25.780 --> 30:28.043
You're asking me to trust you
with the fate of the world.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.395
No.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.223
I'm asking you to trust us.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.487
'Cause we built this
to withstand those winds.

30:39.054 --> 30:41.709
So are you doubting me
or yourself?

30:47.889 --> 30:49.630
Grace.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.415
Please don't lecture
me right now.No. No lecture.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.853
I just want to make sure that
you know what you're doing.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.767
I'm just trying
to protect my family.

30:56.811 --> 30:59.335
I need to get my daughter
and my father on a plane.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.423
She's right, though.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.034
How you gonna do that?

31:02.077 --> 31:03.470
At gunpoint?

31:03.513 --> 31:06.081
You know how dangerous
these people are.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.517
I need to get her
somewhere safe.

31:07.561 --> 31:09.476
And where's that exactly?

31:09.519 --> 31:12.871
Anywhere but here.

31:12.914 --> 31:15.090
Hey, Zo, did you finish packing?

31:15.134 --> 31:17.310
Zoe.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.836
Zoe?

31:23.620 --> 31:26.885
Zoe. Zoe.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.502
Jillian's car is gone.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.156
She left her phone.They couldn't
have gotten far.

31:37.199 --> 31:38.461
Okay? I'll put out an APB.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.681
Just keep your phone close.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.299
DARIUS:
The FBI just told me

31:50.343 --> 31:52.171
that Hugh Keating was taken
from his prison cell

31:52.214 --> 31:53.824
by Navy SEALs, rendition.

31:53.868 --> 31:55.304
You went behind my back
with your father.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.697
I take full responsibility.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.481
Hugh's life was in danger,
there wasn't any time.

31:58.525 --> 31:59.526
Time enough to go to Harris.

31:59.569 --> 32:00.962
I already came
to you, Darius,

32:01.006 --> 32:02.311
for a pardon,
and you said no.

32:02.355 --> 32:03.965
And frankly, none of this
matters right now.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.401
My daughter is missing.

32:05.445 --> 32:06.750
For all I know,
there's a hit out on her.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.143
I have every law
enforcement agency

32:08.187 --> 32:10.450
out there looking for her.

32:10.493 --> 32:13.583
Liam said Jillian
was in a cult, COPE.

32:13.627 --> 32:14.976
Secret Service
checked them out.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.108
A self-help group.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.239
Are you sure?

32:22.027 --> 32:24.420
Get me Alonzo Carter
and revoke security clearance

32:24.464 --> 32:26.814
for Jillian Hayes immediately.

32:28.468 --> 32:33.038
D.C. Metro, open up!

32:33.081 --> 32:34.126
ALONZO :
Are you sure she's here?

32:34.169 --> 32:35.083
The FBI tracked
Jillian's car there

32:35.127 --> 32:36.737
through CCTV cameras.

32:40.088 --> 32:42.134
Yo, I'm not seeing much.

32:42.177 --> 32:44.092
I'm going around back.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.844
♪

33:05.070 --> 33:09.030
Zoe. Zoe.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.858
Jillian.

33:12.381 --> 33:13.904
Alonzo, is she there?

33:13.948 --> 33:17.386
No. Nothing is.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.432
Where did they go?

33:31.096 --> 33:34.273
How far along is she?

33:34.316 --> 33:35.883
About ten weeks.

33:37.928 --> 33:40.453
So right before he died.Yeah.

33:40.496 --> 33:44.587
I didn't want to
tell you like this.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.329
We'll find her, Grace.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.450
Can't sleep?

34:21.494 --> 34:24.236
Neither can I before a launch.

34:24.279 --> 34:26.020
Never been much good
at sitting still,

34:26.064 --> 34:27.282
giving up control.

34:27.326 --> 34:28.588
You don't say.

34:28.631 --> 34:31.025
Well, if you want to take

34:31.069 --> 34:34.028
this particular decision off my
plate, I would not complain.

34:38.859 --> 34:41.949
Looks like it's gonna be
a game-time decision.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.952
Mm.

34:44.995 --> 34:48.434
No one knows the solar sail
better than you and Alycia.

34:48.477 --> 34:50.958
Well, sometimes you think
you know something,

34:51.001 --> 34:52.873
you're sure of it,

34:52.916 --> 34:55.310
and then you're wrong.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.792
Jillian--
how was I so off there?

34:58.835 --> 35:01.273
How am I supposed
to trust my instincts

35:01.316 --> 35:03.101
when they completely failed me?

35:06.016 --> 35:08.671
They didn't fail you.

35:11.326 --> 35:13.546
You were right about Jillian.

35:13.589 --> 35:18.507
That group is... is dangerous.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.466
Dangerous how?

35:20.509 --> 35:23.164
I don't know yet,
but we're gonna find out

35:23.208 --> 35:24.861
and make sure nothing happens
to her.

35:28.604 --> 35:29.953
I don't know if I should be...

35:29.997 --> 35:32.347
happy I'm not crazy,

35:32.391 --> 35:34.306
or terrified I'm right.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.440
Both.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.966
You're going to be right
about this.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.409
To the solar sail.

35:52.759 --> 35:56.284
Long may she wave.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.821
We're out of time.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.910
Now or never.

36:13.954 --> 36:15.869
Okay.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.698
Let's hear it.
Go, no-go for launch.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.047
Flight?

36:20.090 --> 36:21.048
TECH 1:
Go.

36:21.091 --> 36:22.354
Comms?

36:22.397 --> 36:24.007
TECH 2: Go.Guidance?

36:24.051 --> 36:25.008
Go.

36:25.052 --> 36:26.662
Weather?

36:26.706 --> 36:28.751
Sustained winds at 37 knots.

36:28.795 --> 36:30.971
Recommend abort.

36:33.887 --> 36:36.411
It's your call, Liam.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.769
We're go for launch.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.380
Copy.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.382
Transferring launch authority
to Tess.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.038
TESS:
T-minus seven.

36:55.082 --> 36:58.390
Six... five.

36:58.433 --> 36:59.782
Main engine start.

36:59.826 --> 37:02.872
Three... two...

37:02.916 --> 37:04.091
one.

37:04.134 --> 37:07.747
Ignition... and liftoff.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.968
50 seconds. Just make it to 50.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.974
Stage one propulsion nominal.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.715
Come on. 50 seconds.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.022
Vehicle is supersonic.

37:31.118 --> 37:34.469
Approaching max Q.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.779
