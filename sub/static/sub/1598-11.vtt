09:07.214 --> 09:09.675
But if you have something
to say, go ahead.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.218
I didn't think so.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.638
Then excuse me
while I go visit my son,

09:13.638 --> 09:15.347
who, thanks to all of you,
is in juvie

09:15.347 --> 09:17.599
and will probably celebrate
his 14th birthday there.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.644
After that,
I'll finish packing,

09:19.644 --> 09:21.436
and then morning,
I'll be gone.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.562
That work for you?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.272
You bet.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.067
Family sucks ass.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.530
You commute all the way
to North Chicago on this?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.615
It's only 40 minutes.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.118
Thanks.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.717
[babbling]

09:51.717 --> 09:53.051
Yeah.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.762
There's puree over there
for your son, uh--

09:54.762 --> 09:56.304
Ah!
Okay, last time.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.347
Tell me his name.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.724
Yevgeny.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.517
"Yevgenena."
Got it.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.769
You stay here now?

10:01.769 --> 10:02.894
I guess so.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.980
You still need me, yes?
I cook, I clean,

10:04.980 --> 10:07.566
wifely duties.
I sleep on couch.

10:07.566 --> 10:08.776
Wifely duties is?

10:08.776 --> 10:10.527
Oral manipulation
of penis.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.362
No. No, no, no.
See, I can see

10:12.362 --> 10:15.073
how you think how
oral manipulation is no biggie,

10:15.073 --> 10:17.909
but for people who haven't
handled, like, a lot of dicks,

10:17.909 --> 10:21.163
a million dicks--
they don't think that way.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.414
You want I ask V?

10:22.414 --> 10:23.999
- Absolutely not.
- Ask what?

10:23.999 --> 10:25.667
What?

10:25.667 --> 10:28.587
Oh, just if Svetlana needs
to watch the girls.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.297
Now that you and Kev are
back together.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.757
Oh, we're not back together.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.383
(Veronica)
When I asked him
why he was here,

10:33.383 --> 10:35.927
he said it was because
he got kicked out of the dorm.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.805
That's what happened.
What, am I missing something?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.599
Having nowhere to go and
getting back with your wife

10:40.599 --> 10:42.810
because you want to work
on your relationship?

10:42.810 --> 10:43.810
Two different things.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.228
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute,

10:45.228 --> 10:46.605
you want to get
back together?

10:46.605 --> 10:47.939
Not like this.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.232
But I do want to work
on the relationship.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.860
Not what you said.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.360
But that's not the question
you asked!

10:52.360 --> 10:54.863
Well, I shouldn't have
had to.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.158
Okay, I didn't realize that when
you asked, "Why are you here?"

10:58.158 --> 10:59.827
it meant, "Do you want
to get back together?"

10:59.827 --> 11:01.620
Because when you say that,
those words,

11:01.620 --> 11:02.788
to me, have a normal meaning.
[phone ringing]

11:02.788 --> 11:04.372
I didn't know it had
a secret meaning,

11:04.372 --> 11:06.541
but we cleared that up now.
V, come on.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.085
Paco.
Hello?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.838
V, got a broken
water pipe here.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.172
It's real bad.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.883
Where?

11:13.883 --> 11:14.841
Well, did you call
the plumber?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.761
[scoffs]

11:16.761 --> 11:18.261
Busted pipe
in the main room.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.847
Oh, shit.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.348
All right, we'll be there
whenever we can.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.641
We should go
deal with this.

11:22.641 --> 11:23.809
What,
we're going together?

11:23.809 --> 11:25.060
Yeah.
Not "together" together.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.353
Yeah, well, I meant that too,
all right?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.604
Excuse me while I go
get my tools.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.147
You do that.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.860
I'm not a religious man,
per se,

11:32.860 --> 11:34.778
but this whisky will make you
believe in God,

11:34.778 --> 11:37.280
maybe even talk to him.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.200
No, no, no, no.
Wait, no, fuck.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.911
[whispering]
Fuck. Fuck!

11:42.911 --> 11:44.872
Who are we hiding from?

11:44.872 --> 11:47.750
My family.
My sister as much as told me

11:47.750 --> 11:49.000
they're planning
an intervention.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.920
She has a key
to my apartment.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.631
They're probably going up
to wait for me, ambush me.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.342
What kind of intervention?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.469
They want to drag me
to the hospital for treatment.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.096
I told them I'm not going,

12:01.096 --> 12:04.057
but my sister thinks that
when I learned I had cancer,

12:04.057 --> 12:07.227
I had a mental breakdown,
and now I'm...

12:07.227 --> 12:09.855
drinking with
an old homeless man.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.648
That part is true, but--

12:11.648 --> 12:13.859
I'm not homeless.
I told you, I have a home.

12:13.859 --> 12:17.320
I'm just not
welcome there.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.408
Should we go up to the roof?
It's a nice place to drink.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.911
Most places are.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.338
Hi, Fiona Gallagher,
here for Ian Gallagher.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.216
IDs.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.262
Charming.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.097
Bottom line,
Sammi's a fuckin' snitch.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.057
I know people who take
that shit real serious.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.767
What do you mean?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.561
I mean people who will
slip that bitch a roofie,

12:49.561 --> 12:51.521
strap her to a chair,
and pull her fucking teeth out.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.939
Huh. Whoa.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.609
Is he serious?
'Cause I'm on parole.

12:55.609 --> 12:59.362
Much as I might like to,
we are not torturing Sammi.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.329
Nice scooter.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.456
Get back in the vehicle,
now.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.042
Jesus, keep your shirt on.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.793
Thanks, Theo.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.633
G.I. Joe's not
fucking around, huh?

13:19.633 --> 13:24.137
Man's got a rifle.
Just want to point that out.

13:25.972 --> 13:31.770
You warm the cup
with your hands, like this,

13:31.770 --> 13:34.147
and swirl to release
the aroma.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.816
- [laughs]
- Inhale...

13:36.816 --> 13:40.528
And sip.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.490
That's good shit.

13:43.490 --> 13:47.202
Course it better be
for ten Gs.

13:47.202 --> 13:50.956
It tastes like...
the inside of a barn.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.332
[laughs]

13:52.332 --> 13:54.334
But in a good way,
right?

13:55.502 --> 13:56.836
Ugh, ugh.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.837
Woman after my own heart.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.838
[phone ringing]

13:58.838 --> 14:00.966
Oh, God.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.175
[phone ringing]

14:02.175 --> 14:04.094
Ugh, now they're calling.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.971
Thought you got rid
of that phone.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.931
My sister got me another
so we'd stay connected.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.934
[chuckles]

14:09.934 --> 14:12.310
And dying is lonely.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.896
I just wish she understood.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.398
You want to feel alive
up until the day you croak.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.858
Yes, that's it exactly.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.194
I've always been
so cautious.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.739
But there's no reason
for that anymore.

14:24.739 --> 14:28.118
[laughs]

14:28.118 --> 14:30.079
Ahh.

14:30.079 --> 14:32.789
- Oh, oh, oh, easy.
- Oh!

14:32.789 --> 14:34.666
Ohh.

14:34.666 --> 14:35.959
Frank, look at this view.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.045
Uh--
[laughs]

14:41.172 --> 14:42.632
[both shudder]

14:42.632 --> 14:46.761
[laughs]

14:46.761 --> 14:48.805
Little windy today.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.226
[sighs]
Ahh.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.104
Okay.

14:55.104 --> 14:58.815
Three, two, three.
I did--did--

14:58.815 --> 15:01.484
I took ballet
till I was 12.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.238
Fourth position.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.158
F-fifth position.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.659
Pirouette.
Oh!

15:09.659 --> 15:11.202
- Oh, no, no, no, easy, easy.
- [coughs]

15:11.202 --> 15:13.872
- [coughs]
- Hey.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.206
You okay?

15:15.206 --> 15:17.459
Come on, let's get you
off of this--

15:17.459 --> 15:18.793
Jes--Jesus!

15:18.793 --> 15:20.962
(Bianca)
[gasps] Oh! Oh! Frank!

15:22.130 --> 15:25.175
Oh.
Oh, are you okay?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.801
I dropped my cup.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.386
I know, it's okay.
There's plenty more.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.930
Yeah, yeah, that's only about
600 bucks worth of booze.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.474
[laughs]
Oh, Frank.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.851
Hey, I tell you what,
let's get off this roof,

15:34.851 --> 15:36.102
and get our feet
on solid ground, okay?

15:36.102 --> 15:39.272
[gasps] I know!
Let's get crack.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.733
[laughs]

15:43.693 --> 15:47.156
Private Ian Gallagher,
enlisted as Phillip Gallagher,

15:47.156 --> 15:49.449
has been accused
of having gone AWOL,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.327
theft and sabotage
of government property,

15:52.327 --> 15:55.122
and falsifying a federal
document, specifically

15:55.122 --> 15:58.167
an application to join
the United States Armed Forces.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.543
The AWOL charge alone
carries a maximum penalty

16:00.543 --> 16:03.129
of up to five years
in prison.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.673
I'm Staff Sergeant Nathan Kipps,
investigating officer.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.219
It is my job to determine the
circumstances of these crimes.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.055
Tomorrow morning,
I will make a recommendation

16:11.055 --> 16:14.599
as to whether Private Gallagher
will face a court-martial.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.143
You decide?

16:16.143 --> 16:19.854
Excuse me, sir,
Ian is clinically bipolar.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.856
The army should not be
court-martialing him.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.651
If anything,
you should be helping him.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.444
This diagnosis
was made by a doctor?

16:26.444 --> 16:29.406
Yes, yes, sir, and we can get
you those medical records too.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.907
(Officer Kipps)
When was the diagnosis made?

16:30.907 --> 16:32.534
Recently.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.953
But he's been acting crazy
for longer than that.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.287
Yeah, at least
this past year.

16:36.287 --> 16:39.041
How would you characterize
his behavior?

16:39.041 --> 16:42.877
Compared to how he used to be?
He's different.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.880
(Lip)
He'll go back and forth
from, you know, being depressed

16:45.880 --> 16:48.800
to, you know,
incredibly wound up.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.803
I mean, he ran off with a baby
for no reason.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.223
He almost hit me in the head
with a baseball bat.

16:54.223 --> 16:58.351
Our mother was bipolar,
so we know what it looks like.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.145
She put us through hell,
and--

17:00.145 --> 17:02.230
I'm not saying that you
put us through hell,

17:02.230 --> 17:06.693
but when they're manic,
they can be destructive.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.903
(Officer Kipps)
In your opinion,
does he require medication?

17:08.903 --> 17:10.280
(Fiona)
Yes.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.074
(Officer Kipps)
Is he unable
to care for himself?

17:14.242 --> 17:16.120
Sometimes, yes.

17:25.129 --> 17:26.880
Holy shit.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.339
(Veronica)
Niagara Falls.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.716
(Kev)
Is the plumber coming?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.093
Said he could
close the pipe,

17:31.093 --> 17:33.178
but you gotta get
a flooding service here

17:33.178 --> 17:35.013
to dry off the walls
and the floor.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.475
Gonna be five grand.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.977
To mop up water?
Shit, I can mop up water.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.312
No, no, no, we're gonna
do it ourselves.

17:42.312 --> 17:44.939
This happened to us last year
in the bathroom,

17:44.939 --> 17:47.109
and all I did was
tighten the--

17:47.109 --> 17:50.069
Oh, what do you call the--
ah, you know what I'm saying.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.156
You still need me?

17:52.156 --> 17:54.241
No, man, you're good.

17:54.241 --> 17:58.245
All right, I'll text Svetlana,
tell her we're gon' be a while.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.247
You know, having
a Russian sex worker

18:01.247 --> 18:03.875
isn't ideal for childcare.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.711
Yeah, but she does
come in handy.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.172
You didn't fuck her,
right?

18:08.172 --> 18:09.464
What?

18:09.464 --> 18:10.882
I was just checking.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.383
Hell no, I would never
fuck Svetlana.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.929
Or let her blow you?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.389
You let that bitch give you
a blowjob? Seriously?

18:18.389 --> 18:20.225
Well, that's one way
of looking at it,

18:20.225 --> 18:21.601
but I was practically
a bystander.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.436
If my dick wasn't
physically attached--

18:23.436 --> 18:25.063
Her and her wifely duties.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.149
Bitch is full service.
I should have known.

18:27.149 --> 18:30.194
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

18:30.194 --> 18:33.029
"Wifely duties."
Did she say that to you?

18:33.029 --> 18:37.201
Holy shit!
You had sex with her too!

18:37.201 --> 18:39.619
V, that--
that is...

18:39.619 --> 18:41.538
Really hot.

18:41.538 --> 18:44.165
But if you're still angry,

28:04.308 --> 28:05.893
you know, they can't afford
to live here anymore.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.104
You know, so--so the
neighborhood's getting nicer,

28:08.104 --> 28:09.522

28:09.522 --> 28:13.109

you know?

Um, listen, excuse me, I'm gonna
go--I'm gonna go get a smoke.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.695

You too.

but it feels so good.

What do you--what do you say
we take this party

28:34.839 --> 28:36.382

a few feet that way?

28:36.382 --> 28:37.759
Not yet, no.

- Okay.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.766
Because for me,
personally,

29:27.766 --> 29:31.103

is being alive!

29:31.103 --> 29:33.480
What?
I thought--I thought--

29:33.480 --> 29:35.441
I thought we were
on the same page.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.611
Since I'm dying
and you're an aging alcoholic

29:38.611 --> 29:40.654
with no purpose--
no offense--

29:40.654 --> 29:43.449
I thought that we both...

29:43.449 --> 29:45.826
wanted to be doing
something crazy when we go.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.830
I was talking
about enjoying life.

29:48.830 --> 29:49.997
- Yeah.
- Not ending it!

29:49.997 --> 29:51.540
I have a brand new liver!

I'm not ready to
slice it into pieces!

29:54.793 --> 29:58.797
Oh.
Oh, Frank, I'm so sorry.

29:58.797 --> 30:03.636
It's--it's okay.
It's okay.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.054
- The sex was great.
- Yeah.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.765
I think it could be great
without the train.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.893
Probably not, but what's
important is that...

30:10.893 --> 30:12.728
we understand each other now.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.729
Of course.

30:13.729 --> 30:14.730
For you, no trains.

30:14.730 --> 30:15.982
No.

30:15.982 --> 30:19.985
And for me, what I do
is my decision.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.779
Oh, God!

30:21.779 --> 30:22.989
Why does that upset you?

any of them more than once!

31:09.911 --> 31:11.537
I'm not sure.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.998
You see? That's how little
they meant to me.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.624
And is this really
what we're fighting about?

31:15.624 --> 31:18.836
Because when you moved out,
it was not about college chicks.

31:18.836 --> 31:21.964
It was because I was lonely and
you hadn't fucked me in a year!

31:21.964 --> 31:24.842
But apparently, you have
no problem fucking other girls.

31:24.842 --> 31:27.594

that makes me feel?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.854
Baby, I want to
grow old with you.

31:36.854 --> 31:40.024
I'm really sorry I didn't
fuck you before, but...

31:40.024 --> 31:41.984
I really, really want
to fuck you now.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.528
I think about it
constantly.

31:44.528 --> 31:45.529
Really?

31:45.529 --> 31:47.072
You have no idea.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.908
Tell me.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.828
I borrowed Lip's school computer
to get online,

31:52.828 --> 31:54.830
and I found that porn
that we made,

31:54.830 --> 31:56.832
and then
I jerked off to it.

I almost didn't get in

a Muslim spy or something.

Um, well, um--
I'm glad you came.

32:46.507 --> 32:49.843
You know, I wasn't sure you
would when I called you.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.887
Of course I would.

32:51.887 --> 32:55.183
I hitched a ride
with a tractor salesman

32:55.183 --> 32:58.519

Since when?

33:07.903 --> 33:10.072
Oh, yes, he's great.

33:10.072 --> 33:14.118
His name is Walter
and he's very handsome.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.162
I'd like to meet him.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.663
Oh, definitely.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.039
I don't know where he is
right now,

33:19.039 --> 33:20.999

33:20.999 --> 33:24.753
When are you getting
out of this place?

33:24.753 --> 33:29.550
Oh, I'll know more tomorrow,
but it's--it's good to see you.

we still talk.

Which is funny, 'cause
they all say how alike we are.

a compliment.
