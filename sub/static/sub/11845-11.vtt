13:18.264 --> 13:21.165
Huh. Well, you know,
in my professional opinion...

13:21.233 --> 13:23.861
I'm gonna have to say that
that is not a story.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.268
Okay, fine.
Well, what about her brother Max?

13:26.338 --> 13:29.035
- He breaks my nose the night before our wedding.
- He broke your nose?

13:29.108 --> 13:31.543
Yeah. It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.079
But he breaks my nose,
then heals it with a steak the next day.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.513
- What do you mean, a steak? Like a-
- Like a steak.

13:36.582 --> 13:40.610
I mean, he completely heals a very
broken nose in-in about 3O seconds.

13:40.686 --> 13:45.055
It was just weird.
It was just really weird.

13:45.124 --> 13:50.756
Huh. Well, maybe-
maybe she's an alien.

15:49.646 --> 15:51.774

- He used the time-space slipstream, dear.
- Duh.

broken nose incident...

19:03.039 --> 19:07.476

about how I'm from a family of aliens.

19:10.914 --> 19:15.511

<i>H' you make a big deal out of it,
it'll look suspicious.</i>

19:18.455 --> 19:21.220

19:23.860 --> 19:26.124

- My treat.
- Oh. Where?

19:33.470 --> 19:36.030
- So, uh, when did you meet Isabel?
-july 5.

19:36.106 --> 19:38.097
- July 5. That's your birthday?
- Yeah. How's that for a present?

19:38.174 --> 19:41.542
God. They're gonna
eat this thing up.

19:41.611 --> 19:44.012
Hey, hey, did you bring
enough for everyone?

19:44.080 --> 19:46.139
Yeah. Where are my manners?
So let me ask you this.

19:46.216 --> 19:48.878
Was she stilljailbait
when you met her?

19:48.952 --> 19:51.978

Hey, uh, Michael,
did you meet my friend Eric?

20:21.251 --> 20:23.447
- Oh. Hey.
- Hi.

20:23.520 --> 20:28.515
- I didn't know you played golf.
-just starting. Looking to get out of the house.

20:28.591 --> 20:32.323
Did you see that shot off the golf cart
in the hole? You don't see that every day.

20:32.395 --> 20:34.523
I'm gonna go out
on a limb and take a guess...

20:34.597 --> 20:37.066
you're not a member of
the Glenhills Country Club.

20:37.133 --> 20:40.899
- Not officially.
- Then you better stick with us.

20:40.970 --> 20:44.964
Cool. We playing for money or what?

20:45.041 --> 20:46.975
You don't need me as a chaperone.

20:47.043 --> 20:50.775
Liz's father has given you the green light
for you guys to be together.

20:50.847 --> 20:52.781
I just don't want her dad
to think I'm some loser...

20:52.849 --> 20:54.783
who doesn't have anything better
to do all morning...

20:54.851 --> 20:57.752
than sit in a booth
and wait for Liz to get off work.

20:57.820 --> 21:00.721
- Must I make the obvious comment?
- Please don't.

21:02.692 --> 21:04.786

- Liz.
- Can we get a table for two?

21:11.401 --> 21:13.665
Oh, certainly, Isabel.

21:13.736 --> 21:15.670
You must be here
to have breakfast with Max...

21:15.738 --> 21:19.174
'cause he's certainly not here
just to see me.

21:19.242 --> 21:22.644
- Are you, Max?
- Certainly not.

21:22.712 --> 21:25.477
This way.

21:30.019 --> 21:32.010
[Sighs]

21:33.189 --> 21:35.817
<i>So how long have you known
Max and Isabel?</i>

21:35.892 --> 21:41.092
Long, long time. We kind of gravitated
toward each other in elementary.

21:41.164 --> 21:44.293
You know, none of us had parents.

21:44.367 --> 21:47.428
I was in the foster system.

21:47.503 --> 21:49.437
<i>Ah! Slice.</i>

21:49.505 --> 21:53.203
- Picked your head up at the last minute.
- Yeah, that's in the trees.

21:53.276 --> 21:57.008
- You wanna take a mulligan?
- No, I don't do drugs.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.845
All right, you guys play ahead.
I gotta go find my ball.

22:04.187 --> 22:07.384
<i>50 I've been doing some more thinking
about this whole Bewitched idea.</i>

22:07.457 --> 22:09.391
- You have?
- Yes.

22:09.459 --> 22:11.655
And the more and more I think about it,
the more convinced I am...

22:11.728 --> 22:15.460
that it would be in everyone's best interest
to bring my Darrin in on the secret.

22:15.531 --> 22:17.522
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

22:17.600 --> 22:20.831
Yeah. I mean, as it is now,
Jesse's a wild card.

22:20.903 --> 22:22.837
For example,
if he knew the secret...

22:22.905 --> 22:25.033
he would know what to say
and what not to say...

22:25.108 --> 22:28.203
- to his buddy the reporter looking for a hot story.
- You have a point.

22:28.278 --> 22:31.543
- Yeah.
- Let me think about it.

22:31.614 --> 22:33.742
Everything okay?

22:33.816 --> 22:35.750
Yeah.
We're just, uh...

22:35.818 --> 22:38.651
talking about how things would be
much easier if we lived in a sitcom.

22:38.721 --> 22:42.521
- <i>Like Frasier?</i>
- <i>More like MyFavoflte Martian.</i>

22:42.592 --> 22:44.526
I'm thinking more like Bewitched

22:44.594 --> 22:46.528
<i>Liz?</i>

22:46.596 --> 22:49.088
Didn't I tell you to
stay away from my daughter?

22:49.165 --> 22:53.102
L-I'm just having breakfast
with my sister. See?

22:53.169 --> 22:57.072
- Here she is- my sister. Say hi, sister.
- Hi, sister.

22:57.140 --> 23:02.874
If I catch you with your hands
on my daughter, why, I'll-

23:02.945 --> 23:04.879
Gee. Thanks, Mr. Parker.

23:04.947 --> 23:07.109
[Sniffs]
They're lovely.

23:10.653 --> 23:12.815
- So that kid is an emancipated minor?
- Yep.

23:12.889 --> 23:17.053
Our firm handled the case.
Watch this. On the green in two.

23:19.062 --> 23:21.622
Hey, doyou think
he would mind if I, uh-

23:21.698 --> 23:23.792
What? Got stoned on the fairway? Yes.

23:23.866 --> 23:25.800
This is my father-in-law's private club.

23:25.868 --> 23:28.530
Just go in the bushes like everyone else.

24:10.680 --> 24:14.776
No one, and I mean no one,
is going to print <i>that.</i>

24:14.851 --> 24:18.014
All right, maybe not the <i>New York</i> Times,
dude, but definitely the Post.

24:18.087 --> 24:20.112
Come on, Eric.
Give me a break. What the-

24:20.189 --> 24:24.092
Hey, l-look. I know what it sounds like,
but I saw what I saw.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.720
Yeah.
[Laughing]

24:26.796 --> 24:29.663
- What's up?
- Oh, honey, you're gonna love this.

24:29.732 --> 24:31.666
Go ahead, tell her.just-

24:31.734 --> 24:34.499
All right. You know yourfriend Michael?
He waved his hand, and it-

24:34.570 --> 24:36.664
I don't know. It was like
he had superpowers or something.

24:36.739 --> 24:39.333
Yeah, he had superpowers!

24:40.510 --> 24:42.444
<i>All right!
All kidding aside...</i>

24:42.512 --> 24:44.708
I'm telling you. There's something
definitely strange about that kid.

24:44.781 --> 24:48.376
I don't know if it's because he's
a psychic or a space alien or what.

24:48.451 --> 24:51.011
- But one thing is for sure.
- A space alien.

24:51.087 --> 24:56.048
Michael Guerin is definitely
not of this world.

24:56.125 --> 24:58.822
- You idiot! - [ Michael] How was I
supposed to know he was watching?

24:58.895 --> 25:02.695
Here's a thought. Maybe you shouldn't be
using your powers to improve your golf game.

25:02.765 --> 25:04.699
I didn't think there was
anyone around, okay?

25:04.767 --> 25:07.532
Well, that right there is the problem.
You didn't think.

25:07.603 --> 25:10.095
Well, now you've really done it.

25:10.173 --> 25:13.165
Eric wants to interview you for his article.
What are you going to do?

25:13.242 --> 25:15.176
What if I fused
his vocal cords together?

25:15.244 --> 25:17.975
- Then he couldn't tell anyone anything.
- He's a writer.

25:18.047 --> 25:22.075
- He'll just write it down.
- I could fuse his fingers together too.

25:22.151 --> 25:23.949
That's not going to work.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.990
- We need a real plan.
- I'll talk to him, okay?

25:27.056 --> 25:30.617
- I'll think of something.
- Why doesn't that fill me with confidence?

25:30.693 --> 25:34.527
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Will you relax? I'm on it.

25:34.597 --> 25:36.531
- On what?
- What?

25:36.599 --> 25:39.569
- Are you talking to me?
- Who else would I be talking to?

25:39.635 --> 25:42.536
- So you're on it?
- On what?

25:42.605 --> 25:43.936
Are you okay?

25:44.006 --> 25:44.996
What?

25:45.074 --> 25:46.564
What?

25:46.642 --> 25:49.634
[Together]
What?

25:49.712 --> 25:54.013
Uh, I'm-l'm getting confused. Can we-
Can we just all take a minute, okay?

25:54.083 --> 25:57.576
- Okay, Michael, what are you gonna tell Eric?
- I'll think of something.

25:57.653 --> 26:00.350
I don't know what worries me more--
when you don't think or when you do.

26:00.423 --> 26:02.255
That's funny.
You should be on a sitcom.

26:02.325 --> 26:04.953
- Hey, I was gonna say that.
- Don't talk to them.

26:05.027 --> 26:07.018
Let's just all hang up, okay?

26:07.096 --> 26:09.155
Michael, I'll see you in an hour.

26:10.666 --> 26:12.600
Look, I know what I saw, Michael.

26:12.668 --> 26:15.865
- Yeah, you saw me wave a magic wand
and bend a tree. - No wand. No, uh-uh.

26:15.938 --> 26:17.599
It was just your hand.

26:17.673 --> 26:21.405
Let me ask you something.
What was really in the flask?

26:23.346 --> 26:26.213
- Scotch.
- What were you doing in the bushes?

26:26.282 --> 26:28.580
I was looking for a place
to, you know, relieve myself.

26:30.152 --> 26:32.143
Come on. You weren't--

26:34.757 --> 26:36.885
- Yeah, I was- a little.just a little.
- Yeah, right.

26:36.959 --> 26:39.792
Okay, dude, it wasn't like the fat ones
you used to roll in the old days, all right?

26:39.862 --> 26:42.263
Ow!

26:42.331 --> 26:46.268
<i>In the old days?
Care to elaborate, Mr, Ramirez?</i>

26:46.335 --> 26:48.269
Not-Not really, honey.

26:48.337 --> 26:51.796
You know, it was college.
Uh, rah, rah, sis-boom-bah.

26:53.009 --> 26:54.568
Nice typewriter.

26:54.644 --> 26:57.579
- What is that, a G4?
- Uh, no.

26:57.647 --> 26:59.843
It's just an old dinosaur.

27:02.084 --> 27:05.349
Oh, don't tell me this.

27:05.421 --> 27:09.790
- Sweetheart, can I see you outside for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

27:17.099 --> 27:19.033
Technology.

27:19.101 --> 27:22.196
Hey, look, I stopped smoking
a long time ago.

27:22.271 --> 27:25.571
I don't care about that. All right?
I want you to get Eric to drop the story.

27:25.641 --> 27:29.635
All of it. No more research, no more
questions, no more digging into my past.

27:29.712 --> 27:31.646
Whoa. Wh-What's goin' on?
I mean...

27:31.714 --> 27:33.705
it's just some stupid thing
Eric's making up to get a byline.

27:33.783 --> 27:36.081
No, it- it's more than that,
all right?

27:36.152 --> 27:38.951
First, he's asking me questions.
Then, it's my friends.

27:39.021 --> 27:41.786
Next it's gonna be my parents.
I want it to stop, now.

27:41.857 --> 27:44.485
- Why?
- Because, okay?

27:44.560 --> 27:49.327
Because the past is something
that I'm trying to leave behind.

27:49.398 --> 27:52.424
Okay? It brings up
a lot of issues for me.

27:52.501 --> 27:55.527
Max and I werejust dumped in the desert
when we were little kids by our real parents.

27:55.605 --> 27:58.131
I mean, what kind of people do that?

27:58.207 --> 28:00.335
What kind of family am I from?
I don't wanna know the answer...

28:00.409 --> 28:03.902
- and I don't even wanna ask the question.
- Okay.

28:03.980 --> 28:08.247
- I'll take care of it, okay?
- Thank you.

28:11.754 --> 28:14.382
Do me a favor.
Drop the story on Isabel and me, all right?

28:14.457 --> 28:16.721
- Yeah, fine. Whatever, man.
- Hey, I'm serious.

28:16.792 --> 28:19.523
I'm serious too. I hear you.
I'll drop the story, I promise.

28:19.595 --> 28:21.529
Let me ask you something.
Am I insane...

28:21.597 --> 28:24.294
or did Michael touch this computer
right before it crashed?

28:24.367 --> 28:27.428
Hey, you know something?
You're right. You're insane.

28:27.503 --> 28:29.995
Well, this thing is totally screwed.

28:30.072 --> 28:32.131
- Mind if I use your computer to check my e-mail?
- Go ahead.

28:32.208 --> 28:35.269
I'm in court until 4:00.
Look, you up for dinner later?

28:35.344 --> 28:37.335
[Sarcastic Chuckle]
Do I have any other options?

28:37.413 --> 28:40.007
- Later.
- Good luck.

29:15.217 --> 29:19.779
<i>You know, all adoptions and foster records
are supposed to be confidential.</i>

29:19.855 --> 29:21.789
I understand that.
Look...

29:21.857 --> 29:24.383
I won't use your name in the article,
and I won't quote you directly.

29:24.460 --> 29:26.394
I'm trying to do some background
research on Michael Guerin...

29:26.462 --> 29:28.396
and I was wondering if you could help.

29:28.464 --> 29:30.933
You know, was there anything unusual about
Michael? Anything out of the ordinary?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.560
No.

29:36.405 --> 29:40.740
Well, there was
this one incident in 1989.

29:40.810 --> 29:43.677
It was right after the county
placed him in his foster home.

29:43.746 --> 29:49.241
He'd been there less than two days before we
get this phone call about this unusual event.

29:49.318 --> 29:51.616
An event?

29:51.687 --> 29:56.124
They said Michael made
the kitchen table levitate off the floor--

29:56.192 --> 29:58.126
about three feet off the floor.

29:58.194 --> 30:01.459
Okay, that's--
that's a little odd for a six-year-old.

30:01.530 --> 30:05.667
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, would that be in the county records?

30:05.668 --> 30:05.691
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, would that be in the county records?

30:05.801 --> 30:09.499
Do you think we're gonna put
something like that in a government file?

30:09.571 --> 30:11.596
You know, and to be honest with you,
you know...

30:11.674 --> 30:15.110
Michael's foster father,
he wasn't exactly reliable.

30:15.177 --> 30:18.112
- You know?
- Yeah.

30:18.180 --> 30:21.275
- Anything else?
- No. I mean...

30:21.350 --> 30:23.717
other than the way he came to us.

30:23.786 --> 30:28.690
You know, a little kid. He was found
just wandering out in the desert like that.

30:28.757 --> 30:30.919
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I thought Max and Isabel...

30:30.993 --> 30:33.860
- were the ones that were found
wandering in the desert. - They were.

30:33.929 --> 30:36.523
About a week before.

30:37.766 --> 30:40.792
Now, that- that's a story.

30:45.507 --> 30:48.772
I've got my story.
No, I really got it.

30:48.844 --> 30:51.870
- <i>What f5</i> it? - It's about three little
kids found wandering in the desert.

30:51.947 --> 30:54.939
It's about three little kids
with special powers.

30:55.017 --> 30:58.317
It's about Max, Michael and Isabel.

30:58.387 --> 31:00.719
- You told me you were dropping this.
- Yeah. No, I did.

31:00.789 --> 31:03.349
And, dude, I swear to God I was going to.
But then I get a call...

31:03.425 --> 31:06.292
from one of my sources who tells me
about this social worker who's got a story.

31:06.361 --> 31:08.295
<i>And does she ever.
She tells me that...</i>

31:08.363 --> 31:11.560
<i>Michael Guerin was levitating tables
at the age of six.</i>

31:11.633 --> 31:13.533
- You don't believe that.
- Does/ft matter.

31:13.602 --> 31:15.934
I don't have to believe it, don't have to prove it.
All I need are sources...

31:16.004 --> 31:18.496
and between the social worker and you,
I got plenty.

31:18.574 --> 31:21.703
- Me? - Yeah. Yeah, the broken
nose incident with the meat.

31:21.777 --> 31:23.871
<i>The mysterious ice maker incident.</i>

31:23.946 --> 31:27.007
<i>- That wasn't for you to write.
- Dude, relax. I'm not gonna use your name.</i>

31:27.082 --> 31:30.211
Come on,jesse. This could be
huge for me. Don't you get it?

31:30.285 --> 31:34.244
Look it. Look it. I've got mysteriously
sealed records. I've got anonymous sources.

31:34.323 --> 31:37.588
This thing has government conspiracy
written all over it.

31:37.659 --> 31:40.788
- I mean, this story is gonna go national.
-just wait, okay?

31:40.863 --> 31:43.389
Slow down.
What is the story?

31:43.465 --> 31:48.096
Max, Michael and lsabel-

31:48.170 --> 31:50.605
<i>they're the Roswell aliens.</i>

31:58.046 --> 32:00.037
Oh. my God!

32:00.115 --> 32:03.574
- What?
- I-|-|--

32:03.652 --> 32:06.622
- Settle down. Settle down.
- What's wrong?

32:06.688 --> 32:09.623
There is a spaceship in the basement!

32:16.231 --> 32:20.065
<i>This is bad.
This is really bad.</i>

32:20.135 --> 32:22.627
None of this would've happened if you
hadn't gotten careless with your powers.

32:22.704 --> 32:27.005
Hey, it's not my fault,
except for the part that is.

32:27.075 --> 32:30.443
[Sighs]
Well, what are we going to do?

32:30.512 --> 32:32.844
I guess we'll have to find
another planet to hide out on.

32:32.915 --> 32:35.111
- Well, I like this planet.
- Me too.

32:35.184 --> 32:37.949
Where else are you gonna find another planet
that has Whoppers and Big Macs?

32:38.020 --> 32:39.954
[Together]
Shut up.

32:40.022 --> 32:41.956
<i>[ Michael]
I think you're both overreacting.</i>

32:42.024 --> 32:44.857
No serious magazine
is gonna print that story.

32:44.927 --> 32:47.328
Three alien kids in the desert?
It's ridiculous.

32:47.396 --> 32:49.831
The best thing he's gonna do is
get some quick cash from some tabloid.

32:49.898 --> 32:53.027
Yeah, and they're gonna plaster our faces
all over the cover of the Enquirer.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.035
<i>[ Max]
lt'!! draw attention.</i>

32:55.103 --> 32:58.004
Even if people don't believe it at first,
it'll make people think.

32:58.073 --> 33:00.974
Fine. So it's really bad, and it's all my fault.
ls everybody happy now?

33:01.043 --> 33:04.206
- This isn't helping, Michael.
- [ Sighs]

33:04.279 --> 33:07.112
What are we gonna do?

33:09.084 --> 33:11.644
I have no idea.

33:19.261 --> 33:22.561
<i>- I'm awake.
- Oh.</i>

33:22.631 --> 33:24.565
- It's late.
- Yeah.

33:24.633 --> 33:28.399
- Where have you been?
- I just went for a walk.

33:30.539 --> 33:34.237
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

33:38.146 --> 33:41.116
Is there anything unusual about you?

33:41.183 --> 33:43.379
Anything I should know about?

33:44.620 --> 33:46.748
- <i>Like</i> what?
- <i>[Chuck/es]</i>

33:46.822 --> 33:50.520
I don't know, exactly.
But,just-

33:50.592 --> 33:52.720
Some strange things
have happened, and-

33:52.794 --> 33:57.163
<i>Things that I've tried to ignore,
but I cant.</i>

33:57.232 --> 33:59.223
So...

34:00.936 --> 34:03.371
I guess I'm asking, um...

34:03.438 --> 34:07.932
do you have some kind
of psychic ability?

34:10.112 --> 34:13.103
" Psychic?
<i>'</i> [ Laughs]

34:13.181 --> 34:17.777
I know how that sounds,
but certain things just make me wonder.

34:17.853 --> 34:19.947
Like what?

34:21.989 --> 34:24.618
Like our sex life.

34:24.693 --> 34:29.995
Not that I'm complaining, but it's just
sex with you is almost hallucinogenic.

34:30.065 --> 34:32.726
Like, I'm on acid or something.

34:32.801 --> 34:34.929
<i>I mean,
not that I've ever done that.</i>

34:35.003 --> 34:37.835
But I'm-l'm just-

34:37.906 --> 34:40.204
I don't know.
I-l mean, it's just weird.

34:40.275 --> 34:44.974
I love it. I love it,
but it's definitely weird.

34:45.047 --> 34:47.414
So, uh,you ready for a little, uh-

34:56.391 --> 35:00.328
- [ Groans]
-jesse, are you stoned?

35:00.395 --> 35:04.559
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.
- Psychic, like Carrie?

35:04.633 --> 35:07.762
- Okay, stop.
- You sure you went to Harvard?

35:07.836 --> 35:10.032
Look, forget it, okay?
just forget-

35:10.105 --> 35:12.665
- Turn off the light. I feel stupid in the light.
- Oh.

35:12.741 --> 35:16.041
But in the dark, it's okay to think
that you're married to a witch.

35:16.111 --> 35:20.241
Yes. Turn it off.
Come on. Turn it off.

35:25.787 --> 35:28.757
- I can't believe I said that.
- Yeah.

35:30.826 --> 35:35.059
Well, if you think that sounded crazy,
wait until you hear Eric's latest idea.

35:35.130 --> 35:37.997
- What's that?
- You're never gonna believe this.

35:38.066 --> 35:43.027
He's actually got a story
that sounds like you, Max and Michael...

35:43.105 --> 35:47.474
are all the Roswell aliens.

35:47.542 --> 35:48.805
- Huh.
- Yeah.

35:48.877 --> 35:51.869
<i>- W cw .
- [ Philip] The Roswell aliens.</i>

35:54.783 --> 35:58.447
- That's crazy.
- Hey, he'sjust trying to make a sale.

35:58.520 --> 36:01.285
I mean, I seriously doubt
he even believes it himself.

36:01.356 --> 36:06.419
So who is this social worker who fed him this
nonsense about the kids having psychic powers?

36:06.495 --> 36:09.157
He wouldn't say.
Said he promised her anonymity.

36:09.231 --> 36:11.757
And, uh, frankly, I don't even know
how he tracked this person down.

36:11.833 --> 36:15.064
I mean, all those records
are supposed to be kept under seal.

36:15.137 --> 36:18.630
You know what?
We might have her name.

36:18.707 --> 36:20.801
Pull Michael's emancipation files.

36:20.876 --> 36:24.608
It might have a list of his counselors
over at county services.

36:24.679 --> 36:26.670
That's a good idea.

36:35.023 --> 36:37.117
It's not here.

36:39.461 --> 36:41.327
- What do you mean?
- It's not here.

36:41.396 --> 36:45.094
Unless it was misfiled or-

36:45.167 --> 36:47.431
<i>- You stole it!
- Oh, come on, §esse.</i>

36:47.502 --> 36:49.664
I was gonna give it back tomorrow.
It's no big deal.

36:49.738 --> 36:51.672
You know what you did is a felony?

36:51.740 --> 36:55.176
- And I could have you arrested just
by picking up the phone! - Hey, easy.

36:55.243 --> 36:57.177
I know you're pissed off,
but I'm just doing my job.

36:57.245 --> 36:59.236
I'm a reportenjesse.
It's a good story.

36:59.314 --> 37:02.477
No, not anymore it isn't.

37:02.551 --> 37:05.350
- What is this?
- That's an injunction preventing you from selling...

37:05.420 --> 37:07.354
<i>or attempting to sell
any information...</i>

37:07.422 --> 37:10.915
<i>based on illegal access to records
protected by attorney-client privilege.</i>

37:13.628 --> 37:16.290
<i>Sorry we had to do this to you.</i>

37:16.364 --> 37:20.062
- [ Squawks]
- But you really didn't leave us much choice.

37:20.135 --> 37:22.934
- She's an alien!
- So, what should we do with him?

37:23.004 --> 37:27.066
[Sighs]
I'm thinking the pet store.

37:27.142 --> 37:29.907
- A nice little boy would love to take you home.
-[Squawks]

37:29.978 --> 37:33.141
I'm not an animal!
[Squawks] I'm a human being.

37:33.215 --> 37:35.206
Just keep telling yourself that.

37:35.283 --> 37:37.445
I'll be back before dinner.

37:37.519 --> 37:42.582
[Squawks] Damn it,jim!
I'm a reporter, not a parrot!

37:42.657 --> 37:44.591
- I don't believe this.
- Yeah, well, believe it.

37:44.659 --> 37:47.094
Now, just pack your stuff and get out!

37:47.162 --> 37:50.462
- What? - Look, Eric, I asked you
to drop the story as a friend.

37:50.532 --> 37:54.730
And what did you do? You lied to me!
You knew you weren't going to let it go!

37:54.803 --> 37:56.464
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

37:56.538 --> 37:58.472
Eric, you looked me in the eye
and told me...

37:58.540 --> 38:01.100
that one of your sources
put you on to the social worker...

38:01.176 --> 38:04.271
when the truth was
you stole it from my own office!

38:04.346 --> 38:07.577
All right, I screwed up! I admit it!
I won't write the stupid alien story.

38:07.649 --> 38:11.643
But, come on,jesse.
It's you and me, man. We go back.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.849
Uh-uh. You can insult me.
You can hit me.

38:14.923 --> 38:18.655
You can do almost anything you want to me,
and usually I'll find a way to get over it, okay?

38:18.727 --> 38:21.526
But you can't lie to me in my own house.

38:21.596 --> 38:24.998
<i>You can't take advantage
of my trust and my friendship!</i>

38:25.066 --> 38:27.091
Now, I want you gone!

38:27.169 --> 38:29.194
Don't come back!

38:46.988 --> 38:51.186
<i>None of this would be necessary
if we could just tell the humans the truth.</i>

38:51.259 --> 38:54.957
Are you serious? These primates
have barely mastered walking upright.

38:55.030 --> 38:58.523
- They couldn't handle the truth.
-jesse didjust fine.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.399
Yeah, he's a real genius.

39:01.469 --> 39:03.631
You're talking about my husband.

39:03.705 --> 39:05.833
Must you remind me?

39:05.907 --> 39:08.740
- If it weren't forjesse-
- Life would be much quieter.

39:08.810 --> 39:11.245
And I would be miserable.

39:11.313 --> 39:13.304
[Sighs]
We're meant to be together, Max.

39:13.381 --> 39:17.113
You'rejust going
to have to accept that.

39:17.185 --> 39:19.950
Isabel, it's bad enough
you married one of them.

39:20.021 --> 39:22.752
But try to remember that
you are from a superior race of beings.

39:22.824 --> 39:25.259
A race that has conquered
the mysteries of space travel.

39:25.327 --> 39:28.388
A race that stands head and shoulders
above these primitive monkey children.

39:28.463 --> 39:30.932
I found the problem with the spaceship.

39:30.999 --> 39:33.730
My yo-yo was caught in the warp drive!

39:36.304 --> 39:40.104
Well, some of us stand
a little taller than others.

39:42.777 --> 39:46.338
- Sojesse saved the day?
- Yeah.

39:46.414 --> 39:48.405
I know what you're gonna say.

39:48.483 --> 39:52.886
That's twice now that he's saved us, and so
now he's earned the right to know the truth.

39:52.954 --> 39:56.720
- And I don't necessarily disagree, but I think that-
- No, <i>Max.</i>

39:56.791 --> 40:00.921
I'm really, really not pushing
to tell him right now.

40:00.996 --> 40:03.863
<i>He was really mad.</i>

40:03.932 --> 40:06.526
I've never seen him so angry,
you know, and he was angry...

40:06.601 --> 40:08.865
because he was lied to
by someone he trusted.

40:08.937 --> 40:11.531
You're his wife.
He'll forgive you.

40:11.606 --> 40:14.507
Maybe.

40:14.576 --> 40:18.877
But he'll never forget I lied.
You know, it'll always be there between us.

40:18.947 --> 40:22.474
I wanna tell him, but, um...

40:22.550 --> 40:25.383
I'm afraid to.

40:25.453 --> 40:27.785
The problem is,
I don't live in a sitcom.

40:27.856 --> 40:31.349
You know, they get to wrap
everything up all nice and neat.

40:31.426 --> 40:33.690
Real life is complicated.

40:41.002 --> 40:43.198
Can't sleep?

40:45.073 --> 40:48.373
I just--

40:48.443 --> 40:50.673
I just keep thinking of your friend Eric.

40:50.745 --> 40:54.739
I mean,you guys were
really close for a long time.

40:54.816 --> 40:59.276
Yeah, well, things change.

41:01.323 --> 41:04.258
Don't worry.
I have other friends, okay?

41:04.326 --> 41:09.162
Besides, you are all that matters to me.

41:09.230 --> 41:11.255
You're all I need.

41:18.606 --> 41:21.974
So, what's the lesson, Isabel?

41:22.043 --> 41:24.478
Never trust one of your friends.

41:24.546 --> 41:27.777
Never use your powers
out in public, dear.

41:27.849 --> 41:31.285
And never let Max park
the spaceship in the basement.

41:31.353 --> 41:34.323
- Promise?
- Alien's honor.

41:34.389 --> 41:36.380
Then come here.

41:36.458 --> 41:38.722
Oh, you're all that matters to me.

41:38.793 --> 41:41.990
- You're all I need.
- Oh, sweetheart.

41:42.063 --> 41:43.929
