<i>"Dante, do not weep yet" Beatrice said.</i>

00:04.416 --> 00:11.323
<i>"Do not weep yet, for soon another wound shall
make you weep far more tears than those!"</i>

You keep falling asleep...
You need treatment.

05:27.176 --> 05:29.135
Have you got anything smaller?

05:39.556 --> 05:40.889
Here's your change.

05:45.591 --> 05:48.678
Thanks a lot... Have a nice day.

06:01.251 --> 06:03.417
- Are you paying by card or cash?
- Card.

06:05.373 --> 06:08.415
Green and your pin.

06:15.715 --> 06:18.215
I'm very sorry, I have to
close the checkout.

06:18.573 --> 06:20.823
My God... That's my luck!

06:22.584 --> 06:24.416
Are you going for a long time?

06:24.501 --> 06:26.251
Only for a minute.

10:50.501 --> 10:52.917
What are you doing here?

10:57.334 --> 11:02.126
Do you hear?

11:06.595 --> 11:09.054
Up!

11:10.501 --> 11:12.792
I'm talking to you!

11:17.042 --> 11:19.876
Why did you get a job here?

11:20.417 --> 11:22.417
To sleep?

11:22.997 --> 11:26.164
You're keeping others out
of a job here! Faster! Move!

11:27.064 --> 11:28.564
You're out of here!

11:29.876 --> 11:33.001
Get lost!

12:24.168 --> 12:28.835
<i>Midway in our life's journey, I went astray
from the straight road</i>

12:29.341 --> 12:32.466
<i>and woke to find myself
alone in a dark wood.</i>

12:33.251 --> 12:35.821
<i>How shall I say
what wood that was!</i>

12:36.128 --> 12:40.876
<i>I never saw so drear a wilderness.
Its very memory gives a shape to fear.</i>

12:41.209 --> 12:44.300
<i>Death couldn't be more
bitter than that place.</i>

12:45.628 --> 12:50.950
<i>But since it came to good, I will recount
all that I found revealed there by God's grace.</i>

12:52.917 --> 12:55.629
<i>How I came to it
I cannot rightly say,</i>

12:55.714 --> 13:00.440
<i>so drugged with sleep had I become when
I first wandered there from the True Way.</i>

13:01.025 --> 13:04.123
<i>But at the far end
of that valley of evil,</i>

13:04.623 --> 13:09.126
<i>whose maze had sapped
my heart with fear,</i>

13:09.614 --> 13:12.360
<i>I found myself before a little hill
and lifted up my eyes.</i>

13:12.445 --> 13:16.633
<i>It glowed with the sweet rays of that planet
whose virtue leads men straight on every road,</i>

13:16.908 --> 13:21.148
<i>so did I turn, my soul still fugitive
from death's surviving image,</i>

13:21.233 --> 13:24.859
<i>to stare down that pass
that none had ever left alive.</i>

13:25.959 --> 13:29.890
<i>And there I lay to rest from my heart's race
till breath returned to me.</i>

13:29.940 --> 13:35.420
<i>Then rose and pushed up that dead slope,
each footfall rose above the last.</i>

13:36.996 --> 13:40.594
<i>And lo! At the beginning
of the rise</i>

13:40.644 --> 13:44.913
<i>I faced a spotted Leopard,
all tremor and flow.</i>

13:46.376 --> 13:50.457
<i>Yet not so much but what I shook
with dread at sight of a great Lion</i>

13:51.223 --> 13:58.741
<i>that broke upon me raging with hunger, its head
held high as if to strike a mortal terror.</i>

13:58.959 --> 14:04.664
<i>And down his track, a She-Wolf
drove upon me gaunt and craving.</i>

14:05.617 --> 14:08.466
<i>Oh, many the souls she has
brought to grief!</i>

14:08.876 --> 14:12.466
<i>She brought such heaviness
upon my spirit at sight of her savagery,</i>

14:12.616 --> 14:15.251
<i>I died from every hope
of that high summit.</i>

14:17.020 --> 14:19.207
<i>And as I fell to my soul's ruin,</i>

14:19.508 --> 14:24.011
<i>a presence gathered before me,
the figure hoarse from long silence.</i>

14:25.001 --> 14:28.003
<i>At sight of him
in that friendless waste I cried:</i>

14:29.059 --> 14:34.146
<i>"Have pity on me, whatever thing you
are, whether shade or living man."</i>

14:35.001 --> 14:37.098
<i>And it replied:</i>

14:38.077 --> 14:41.964
<i>"Not man,
though man I once was,</i>

14:43.013 --> 14:47.249
<i>and my blood was Lombard,
both my parents Mantuan.</i>

14:48.834 --> 14:50.731
<i>I was a poet,</i>

14:51.042 --> 14:55.536
<i>and sang of old Anchises' noble son
who came to Rome after the burning of Troy.</i>

14:55.912 --> 14:58.474
<i>After that Ilion
the superb was burned</i>

14:58.868 --> 15:01.890
<i>But you, why do you
return to these distresses?</i>

15:02.959 --> 15:07.964
<i>And are you then that Virgil
and that fountain of purest speech?"</i>

15:08.461 --> 15:11.751
<i>My voice grew tremulous:</i>

15:13.334 --> 15:18.021
<i>"Poet, by that God
to you unknown,</i>

15:18.531 --> 15:23.637
<i>lead me this way. Beyond this
present ill and worse to dread</i>

15:24.447 --> 15:29.726
<i>lead me to Peter's gate and be my guide
through the sad halls of Hell."</i>

16:33.459 --> 16:38.459
<i>Piotr Michalowski, "Blue Boy".</i>

16:39.376 --> 16:46.959
<i>This painting shows a boy
riding a horse, ready to jump.</i>

16:48.274 --> 16:53.524
<i>Both of them are shown from the side.</i>

16:54.167 --> 16:58.584
<i>The boy's head is adorned with a red cup.</i>

16:59.167 --> 17:02.292
<i>He holds the reins in his hand.</i>

17:02.876 --> 17:09.209
<i>We do not know where the Blue Boy
is heading on his anxious horse.</i>

17:09.959 --> 17:16.751
<i>It seems they are about
to jump into thick fog.</i>

17:19.209 --> 17:22.001
<i>His hand is suspended in the air.</i>

17:22.459 --> 17:25.291
<i>We can't see the left hand.</i>

17:25.492 --> 17:30.951
<i>Next to the elbow anchored to the table
stands a bottle of wine.</i>

17:31.959 --> 17:37.959
<i>To the right, a transparent wine glass
is half filled with red wine.</i>

17:42.149 --> 17:45.024
<i>A white tablecloth covers the table.</i>

17:45.364 --> 17:48.531
<i>Sunrays permeate the entire painting.</i>

19:05.126 --> 19:07.251
<i>One has to survive.
Also here, in Silesia.</i>

19:07.667 --> 19:09.751
<i>Although the flood has taken
almost everything.</i>

19:10.138 --> 19:12.222
<i>And what was saved was looted.</i>

19:13.834 --> 19:18.251
<i>In Opole con volunteers tricked people
into collecting money for the flood relief.</i>

19:18.760 --> 19:24.196
<i>There are also acts of vandalism and theft -</i>

19:24.281 --> 19:27.983
<i>I've seen broken windows in many houses...</i>

19:31.665 --> 19:33.499
Hallo, answer me.

19:35.214 --> 19:36.797
I know you're there. Answer.

19:37.005 --> 19:38.463
Are you watching TV?

19:38.817 --> 19:41.067
Do you see what's going on?

19:42.653 --> 19:45.320
I know you can hear me...

19:45.655 --> 19:48.530
I know you can hear me
and please answer me.

19:48.694 --> 19:50.777
Won't you, please?

19:53.581 --> 19:56.373
<i>When will you return my car?</i>

19:58.207 --> 20:01.249
<i>I'm afraid that...,
that you are driving.</i>

20:01.815 --> 20:04.815
<i>You shouldn't.
Not after that accident.</i>

20:06.709 --> 20:09.001
<i>Pick up the phone, I beg you.</i>

20:09.149 --> 20:12.149
<i>I know you're there. Please.</i>

20:13.600 --> 20:15.475
<i>Give your auntie a call.</i>

20:16.126 --> 20:18.209
<i>Bye, I'm waiting.</i>

20:19.167 --> 20:21.251
<i>Waiting.</i>

20:26.126 --> 20:27.959
Kisses.

20:28.501 --> 20:30.584
Bye.

20:31.251 --> 20:36.417
<i>...I asked God to have mercy
and put a stop to this enormous wave...</i>

20:36.751 --> 20:40.292
<i>I drove up to the breach
and it knocked me down.</i>

20:40.542 --> 20:45.709
<i>Good God, only you...
you've got that strength.</i>

20:45.847 --> 20:47.847
<i>People are no use,
they can't help...</i>

20:55.084 --> 20:56.709
<i>We are entering suburbs...</i>

20:57.215 --> 21:00.757
<i>flooded cemetery, enormous
epidemiological threat.</i>

21:01.184 --> 21:04.601
<i>Cemeteries under water,
you don't know what to do with it...</i>

21:04.959 --> 21:07.709
<i>The coffins are surfacing everywhere...</i>

21:07.794 --> 21:11.062
<i>Flooded cesspools, refuge collectors
and dumping grounds.</i>

21:11.185 --> 21:15.144
<i>Drowned animals, rotting food
is a hazard to our health.</i>

21:15.403 --> 21:19.028
<i>Eating it can lead to severe
diseases and even death.</i>

21:35.709 --> 21:38.459
<i>Polish Radio, Warsaw, Channel One.</i>

21:44.042 --> 21:47.751
<i>Two dead and one missing
is the toll taken so far...</i>

21:47.959 --> 21:50.167
<i>by the waters flooding
the south of the country.</i>

21:50.376 --> 21:54.042
<i>Roads and railway lines are submerged.
The floodwater is getting into homes...</i>

21:54.292 --> 21:56.459
<i>forcing the evacuation
of hundreds of people.</i>

21:56.667 --> 22:02.584
<i>So far 850 have had to leave their homes
according to the Ministry of the Interior.</i>

22:02.792 --> 22:05.376
<i>The situation is worst in Silesia.</i>

22:05.626 --> 22:08.292
<i>Flood barriers are leaking
in many places,</i>

22:11.334 --> 22:13.501
<i>Our Katowice correspondent is there.</i>

22:13.716 --> 22:16.424
<i>As Monika Krasinska reports,
the dikes are like sieves.</i>

22:16.696 --> 22:18.321
<i>Water is seeping in everywhere.</i>

22:18.724 --> 22:20.932
<i>People are watching
what's happening in terror.</i>

22:21.167 --> 22:22.409
<i>It's not good anywhere.</i>

22:22.501 --> 22:24.876
<i>If you look at that river,
it's horrifying.</i>

22:25.334 --> 22:27.292
<i>It keeps raining,
it can only get worse.</i>

22:27.501 --> 22:28.803
<i>People are desperate.</i>

22:28.888 --> 22:32.793
<i>During a meeting with prime minister Donald
Tusk they blamed the local authorities.</i>

22:32.917 --> 22:34.209
<i>Someone should just...</i>

22:34.417 --> 22:38.209
<i>There was this threat...
and nobody was dealing with it.</i>

22:38.417 --> 22:43.792
<i>40 minutes the water was reaching us,
we just managed to escape to the top floor.</i>

22:44.376 --> 22:47.860
<i>Prime Minister, it's terrible.
There was this disaster coming,</i>

22:48.001 --> 22:50.792
<i>And nobody warned us.</i>

22:51.209 --> 22:53.542
<i>What were the emergency
services doing?</i>

22:53.834 --> 22:56.084
<i>What were they doing all night?</i>

22:56.542 --> 22:59.143
<i>The fire brigade is appealing
to people in the flooded areas...</i>

22:59.292 --> 23:03.959
<i>to follow the evacuation plan,
but many are refusing.</i>

23:04.240 --> 23:06.657
<i>People are afraid to leave
their houses unguarded.</i>

24:22.045 --> 24:23.712
I can't pray.

24:28.126 --> 24:31.209
It was a terrible accident, I know.

24:32.584 --> 24:38.209
But you survived...
God protected you.

24:39.001 --> 24:40.917
But not the others?

24:42.084 --> 24:45.376
They're with the Lord now.

24:49.420 --> 24:51.087
Did they suffer?

24:52.751 --> 24:55.126
They didn't have time.

24:55.334 --> 24:59.084
And a Guardian Angel
took you into its care.

25:00.042 --> 25:02.792
So it didn't take the others.

25:03.376 --> 25:06.834
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

25:11.542 --> 25:14.542
I had always treated adversity...

25:15.542 --> 25:18.167
as a test by God...

25:18.667 --> 25:21.501
to give me strength.

25:22.334 --> 25:24.167
Now what?

25:25.167 --> 25:29.792
He strengthened me by
killing my loved ones?

25:30.334 --> 25:33.459
Don't just think about yourself.

25:35.052 --> 25:38.718
In faith there is always hope.

25:43.954 --> 25:48.842
We cram the word "hope" into
every disaster and tragedy,

25:49.917 --> 25:53.135
as the only way to cope
with our weakness.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.036
So how do you see it?

25:56.502 --> 25:58.252
Is God all-powerful...

25:59.019 --> 26:00.686
or merciful?

26:00.854 --> 26:05.362
Because if He's merciful,
He's just as powerless as me.

26:09.377 --> 26:12.252
An old question in the Church.

26:13.522 --> 26:15.730
Theodicy.

26:17.664 --> 26:25.997
God is all-powerful to such a degree
that he created his own weakness...

26:29.527 --> 26:31.777
Mercy.

26:34.376 --> 26:37.876
When I pray I feel
my own weakness.

26:40.626 --> 26:42.917
I'm just by myself.

26:43.065 --> 26:44.940
And when I pray...

26:45.557 --> 26:48.265
all I hear is my own voice,

26:48.959 --> 26:50.959
so I'm praying...

26:51.334 --> 26:53.292
just to myself.

26:53.792 --> 26:56.751
Everyone just prays to themselves.

26:56.968 --> 27:00.635
To their own idea of hope,

27:00.817 --> 27:04.651
which, from habit, they call "God".

27:05.245 --> 27:09.704
And if the gods of all the people praying
could gather together in the same church,

27:09.919 --> 27:15.044
they'd never be able
to recognize themselves.

27:19.001 --> 27:20.792
All I know is...

27:21.709 --> 27:24.459
that God is a mystery.

27:26.034 --> 27:29.825
Explained, He would cease to exist.

31:19.637 --> 31:24.777
Tell me, dear, why are you, a poet and
a specialist in the Young Poland period,

31:25.093 --> 31:27.634
working in a supermarket, huh?

31:27.832 --> 31:29.873
Because it suits me, auntie.

31:30.473 --> 31:36.640
But you can always go back to your
University and lecture about your Symbolists.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.817
Listen, you don't keep in touch
with anyone.

31:41.627 --> 31:43.960
No? But I come to you.

31:45.197 --> 31:46.739
Out of duty.

31:47.915 --> 31:51.332
I've got no duties, only choices.

31:53.478 --> 31:56.187
I feel so sorry for you.

31:56.885 --> 31:59.176
If only your parents were alive...

32:02.353 --> 32:05.020
and now this tragedy.

32:08.943 --> 32:11.402
But that's just the way it goes.

32:12.056 --> 32:18.681
We massacred nature by building the motorways
and now nature is paying us back...

32:19.023 --> 32:22.482
with bodies crippled in accidents.

32:25.226 --> 32:27.934
Listen, just forget about it, forget it...

32:28.767 --> 32:30.558
Basia and Kamil.

32:31.217 --> 32:34.134
Your love and your best friend.

32:35.642 --> 32:39.600
I've ordered a mass for
their poor souls.

32:40.966 --> 32:43.341
When were you last at church?

32:45.436 --> 32:46.936
I've been.

32:51.490 --> 32:53.156
I can see you're suffering.

32:55.064 --> 32:58.355
But if you can't change yourself,
change the world.

32:58.587 --> 33:00.629
Feeling good, that's the main thing!

33:00.811 --> 33:03.686
Why should only fools feel good?

33:05.169 --> 33:07.585
Stupidity is infallible, you know

33:07.720 --> 33:11.419
and the world doesn't make
sense without human stupidity.

33:12.344 --> 33:15.601
I sometimes think that all our human
categories are basically false

33:15.719 --> 33:18.187
and everything
is the other way round...

33:18.449 --> 33:23.626
Victory is a punishment
and losing is a prize.

33:23.749 --> 33:24.958
You know,

33:25.250 --> 33:29.167
We see life as the greatest value
and death as the ultimate loss.

33:29.348 --> 33:30.498
And if...

33:30.633 --> 33:36.466
if death is the greatest value,
and life is defeat?

33:37.040 --> 33:38.290
Just think,

33:39.047 --> 33:41.505
paraphrasing Epictetus:

33:42.103 --> 33:46.228
The past cannot die,
because it's already dead.

33:46.417 --> 33:51.208
The future doesn't exist,
because it hasn't arrived yet.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.949
Only the present can die,
the current moment,

33:56.034 --> 33:58.701
and it's constantly dying.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.105
Conclusion?

34:02.534 --> 34:03.951
The conclusion...

34:04.112 --> 34:05.904
Death doesn't exist,

34:06.054 --> 34:10.695
or nothing exists except death.

34:12.974 --> 34:15.266
Oh, I love books.

34:15.844 --> 34:19.385
It's only them that take me seriously.

34:20.139 --> 34:22.264
Generalisations, auntie.

34:22.525 --> 34:24.983
I can't listen to it.

34:29.065 --> 34:32.565
Yes, yes.
I see, I see.

34:33.217 --> 34:35.801
I see that darkness reigns in you.

34:38.549 --> 34:39.840
But you know,

34:40.382 --> 34:46.757
I translated an Old Persian poem recently.
It said something beautiful about darkness.

34:48.860 --> 34:54.194
That darkness is not
the opposite of light...

34:54.513 --> 34:56.721
but its cradle.

34:58.603 --> 35:02.270
Only in darkness
can light be born.

35:26.761 --> 35:29.052
I'll read you something.

35:35.260 --> 35:41.985
"We do not suddenly fall on death,
but advance towards it by slight degrees...

35:42.984 --> 35:46.405
For every day a little of our life
is taken from us;

35:46.490 --> 35:49.605
Even when we are growing,
our life is on the wane.

35:51.991 --> 35:55.741
We lose our childhood,
and then our youth.

35:56.225 --> 35:59.123
Counting even yesterday,
all past time is lost time

35:59.220 --> 36:01.637
the very day which
we are now spending...

36:01.885 --> 36:04.324
is shared between
ourselves and death.

36:05.277 --> 36:08.694
We reach death at
that moment,

36:09.214 --> 36:13.202
but we have been a long
time on the way."

36:16.873 --> 36:18.414
Seneca.

36:20.294 --> 36:23.044
Letters to Lucilius.

36:24.907 --> 36:29.740
And Heidegger with his
idea of forest.

36:35.301 --> 36:36.451
You see,

36:36.970 --> 36:42.511
Heidegger compares life
to being in a "lichtung".

36:45.341 --> 36:48.133
That's something like
a clearing in a dark forest...

36:48.549 --> 36:51.591
or a shaft of light.

36:52.133 --> 36:56.966
Before we're born we
live in that dark forest...

36:58.191 --> 37:00.733
as a potential of being.

37:01.628 --> 37:03.253
And when we're born...

37:03.716 --> 37:06.591
we come out into the
clearing, into the light,

37:06.921 --> 37:09.004
to be visible.

37:10.633 --> 37:14.974
But people only see us
from where they're looking

37:15.193 --> 37:20.026
and during our life nobody,
no-one sees us as a whole.

37:23.216 --> 37:25.424
And after death...

37:25.674 --> 37:27.924
we return to that dark forest,

37:28.133 --> 37:30.924
our entry recorded in the book of life,

37:31.174 --> 37:33.466
because, according to Heidegger,

37:33.966 --> 37:37.758
being is indestructible.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.716
For what is death?

37:48.716 --> 37:50.508
The decay of matter?

37:51.133 --> 37:54.133
The destruction of the consciousness?

37:54.809 --> 37:56.966
Or is it separation,

37:57.066 --> 38:01.851
vanishing from the field
of sight and feeling?

38:05.365 --> 38:09.240
How many people have I buried,
even though they're alive?

38:11.702 --> 38:13.911
How many have buried me?

38:14.157 --> 38:16.199
While I exist, think...

38:16.885 --> 38:18.094
and feel?

38:21.133 --> 38:23.966
There were strong bonds
between us,

38:25.027 --> 38:26.818
we lived together,

38:27.532 --> 38:32.824
we went through similar experiences
and then suddenly with no explanation...

38:33.716 --> 38:39.883
stopped meeting, calling,
writing to each other...

38:40.529 --> 38:44.570
Usually for some trifling reason.

38:44.866 --> 38:47.616
Someone moved away,

38:48.448 --> 38:54.115
said some unkind words or
looked at someone the wrong way

38:54.365 --> 38:58.115
or rather seemed to.

39:00.240 --> 39:03.823
Or more often someone said
that someone had said something

39:04.115 --> 39:05.907
or other.

39:07.534 --> 39:09.534
And that was that.

39:09.951 --> 39:14.349
Bridges built over months
and years collapsed,

39:14.677 --> 39:18.885
washed away in the
river of the banal.

39:19.260 --> 39:21.427
And neither side...

39:21.927 --> 39:25.719
showed any desire
to rebuild them.

39:28.285 --> 39:32.327
You keep rubbing your eyes,
have you had them tested?

39:33.917 --> 39:36.958
It's lucky you got out
in one piece from that crash.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.292
You could have died
or been crippled.

39:40.875 --> 39:44.042
That's even worse than death.

39:46.833 --> 39:49.792
It's a miracle you can see again.

40:42.228 --> 40:44.853
Why didn't you come
to say hallo?

40:45.936 --> 40:50.020
This isn't the time
for saying hallo.

40:50.728 --> 40:53.270
We have to plough all this up.

40:54.728 --> 40:57.936
Such a wasteland.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.936
Look at me, Dad.

41:03.959 --> 41:07.613
Looking doesn't help,
one has to work.

41:07.698 --> 41:09.698
What are you talking about?

41:11.000 --> 41:15.584
You want to know too much
and it doesn't really matter...

41:18.959 --> 41:21.459
they knocked my teeth out,

41:22.625 --> 41:27.292
my shoes are falling
to bits, that's it.

42:17.802 --> 42:19.344
Get up.

42:19.926 --> 42:21.510
It's nearly midnight.

42:22.801 --> 42:24.039
You've had a bad dream,

42:24.124 --> 42:27.236
you were shouting that
they'd knocked your teeth out.

42:28.260 --> 42:30.717
Listen, maybe I should make up
the couch and you can sleep here?

42:30.802 --> 42:32.844
No, no, thanks.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.676
Look.

42:36.176 --> 42:39.676
Look what a lovely
egg Miranda's laid.

42:42.385 --> 42:46.260
I don't even know
who the father is.

43:57.508 --> 43:59.841
I know you can solve this riddle.

44:00.801 --> 44:03.343
I've got 500 for you.

44:04.135 --> 44:07.343
Fresh, new 500.

44:07.700 --> 44:09.450
Specially for you.

44:10.051 --> 44:12.551
I'm still here,
what're you doing?

44:13.176 --> 44:15.260
We're playing for big money.

44:16.926 --> 44:19.010
And time's running out.

44:20.016 --> 44:22.641
It's ticking away.

44:24.741 --> 44:28.908
And I'm waiting here
with these five big ones.

44:30.158 --> 44:32.616
So where are you, huh?

44:39.584 --> 44:41.334
<i>Wake up.</i>

44:41.542 --> 44:45.375
<i>Boys, girls, what are
you up to out there?</i>

44:45.959 --> 44:48.042
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

44:50.334 --> 44:53.084
Do we have a caller?

44:57.125 --> 44:59.056
I hear something. Hallo?

44:59.141 --> 45:01.183
<i>Welcome to our Bikini Quiz.</i>

45:01.625 --> 45:03.500
<i>Thank you for your call.</i>

45:03.680 --> 45:07.065
700888147

45:07.917 --> 45:11.500
500 for you, from me.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.625
Hey there...

45:14.834 --> 45:18.375
if you don't call, I'll take
this five hundred and go.

45:20.625 --> 45:23.959
<i>We'll connect you with
our studio in a moment...</i>

45:26.233 --> 45:30.275
<i>The connection cost is
3,90 per minute plus VAT...</i>

45:32.834 --> 45:35.959
<i>Please hold...</i>

46:04.676 --> 46:06.885
You won.

46:07.279 --> 46:09.613
You didn't even pick up the phone.

46:10.491 --> 46:13.116
We never pick it up.

46:14.190 --> 46:18.190
People call, the counter starts...

46:19.161 --> 46:23.119
and they wait and pay.

46:23.574 --> 46:26.158
Wait and pay...

46:26.472 --> 46:29.597
Wait and pay...

46:30.710 --> 46:34.085
and they don't even know
they're paying...

46:34.985 --> 46:37.069
That's plain fraud.

46:37.788 --> 46:39.871
Fraud?

46:40.732 --> 46:45.274
They get something
invaluable in exchange.

46:46.605 --> 46:48.813
Your bikini?

46:49.199 --> 46:50.658
That too.

46:51.741 --> 46:53.824
But mainly hope,

46:54.877 --> 46:58.627
hope of a win.

47:01.163 --> 47:03.247
Hey...

47:04.241 --> 47:06.324
Cheer up.

47:08.870 --> 47:10.953
You've got me.

47:11.980 --> 47:14.064
You won.

47:14.871 --> 47:16.954
I don't want to.

47:18.699 --> 47:20.116
I can't.

47:20.530 --> 47:22.405
Why not?

47:22.783 --> 47:25.783
All men dream about this.

47:26.449 --> 47:30.199
They lie on their couches,
slurping beer,

47:30.449 --> 47:32.366
devouring chips...

47:32.625 --> 47:36.250
licking me with their eyes.

47:36.533 --> 47:39.824
They want to be with me
on a desert island...

47:40.567 --> 47:43.984
reaching Paradise with me.

48:09.824 --> 48:12.949
<i>Please hold...</i>

48:13.269 --> 48:16.603
<i>We'll connect you with
our studio in a moment...</i>

48:49.408 --> 48:52.103
<i>"Through me you pass
into the city of woe</i>

48:52.188 --> 48:54.662
<i>Through me you pass
into eternal pain</i>

48:54.746 --> 48:57.409
<i>Through me among the people
lost for aye.</i>

48:57.658 --> 49:00.539
<i>Justice the founder
of my fabric moved</i>

49:01.283 --> 49:05.892
<i>To rear me was the task of power divine,
Supremest wisdom and primeval love.</i>

49:06.658 --> 49:12.060
<i>Before me things create were none,
save things eternal, and eternal I endure.</i>

49:12.387 --> 49:15.603
<i>Abandon all hope
ye who enter here."</i>

49:16.824 --> 49:20.994
<i>These mysteries I read cut
into stone above a gate.</i>

49:21.564 --> 49:22.835
<i>And turning I sad:</i>

49:22.920 --> 49:25.291
<i>“Master, What is the meaning
of this harsh inscription?”</i>

49:26.033 --> 49:28.539
<i>And he then as initiate
to novice:</i>

49:29.574 --> 49:34.546
<i>“Here must you put by all division of spirit
And gather your soul against all cowardice.</i>

49:35.247 --> 49:37.756
<i>This is the place
I told you to expect.</i>

49:38.467 --> 49:43.548
<i>Here you shall pass among the fallen people.
Souls who have lost the good of intellect.”</i>

52:31.492 --> 52:33.159
Can you hear me?

52:35.238 --> 52:36.655
It's me.

52:39.287 --> 52:41.120
What's wrong, dear?

52:43.450 --> 52:46.783
I've been waiting
for you all day.

52:49.070 --> 52:51.903
I've made a cheesecake.

52:56.361 --> 52:58.445
What's up with you?

53:00.861 --> 53:02.945
I'm worried about you.

53:04.403 --> 53:06.486
<i>Bye.</i>

53:09.236 --> 53:10.695
<i>Love you.</i>

56:36.153 --> 56:40.232
<i>This is a tragedy, which
exceeds our imagination,</i>

56:40.379 --> 56:46.195
<i>a tragedy whose scale is beyond
anything we have ever experienced.</i>

56:46.445 --> 56:49.653
<i>Unimaginable, difficult to take in.</i>

56:49.861 --> 56:51.861
<i>We all have enormous difficulty.</i>

56:52.070 --> 56:57.236
<i>Getting our heads round the extent
of this unimaginable tragedy.</i>

56:57.445 --> 57:02.320
<i>A tragedy which will leave a dark stain
on the pages of Polish history.</i>

57:02.608 --> 57:05.005
<i>So says Piotr Paszkowski, head
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</i>

57:05.097 --> 57:07.445
<i>Pain, misery and shared prayers.</i>

57:07.653 --> 57:11.028
<i>A tragedy such as the world has
never seen. Poland is in mourning.</i>

57:11.266 --> 57:15.916
<i>No one has survived, says Sergey Antufiev,
Governor of the Smolensk region.</i>

57:16.001 --> 57:17.982
<i>"No one has survived..."</i>

57:18.067 --> 57:20.051
<i>According to our sources</i>

57:20.136 --> 57:26.086
<i>on the plane were 85 members
of the presidential delegation plus staff.</i>

57:26.212 --> 57:28.695
<i>The official Polish
state delegation...</i>

57:28.820 --> 57:31.570
<i>There were 47 other people
on the plane as well.</i>

57:31.655 --> 57:34.528
<i>All together 132 passengers.</i>

57:41.028 --> 57:44.294
<i>Aleksander Szczyglo,
Chief of the National Security Office</i>

57:44.474 --> 57:47.320
<i>Pawel Wypych, Secretary of State</i>

57:47.528 --> 57:50.820
<i>Mariusz Hanzlik, Undersecretary of State</i>

57:51.028 --> 57:53.528
<i>Andrzej Kremer, Deputy Minister
of Foreign Affairs,</i>

57:53.736 --> 57:57.778
<i>Stanislaw Komorowski,
Ministry of National Defence,</i>

57:58.028 --> 58:00.403
<i>Tomasz Merta,
Deputy Minister of Culture,</i>

58:00.945 --> 58:04.111
<i>Franciszek Gagor, Chief of Staff
Polish Armed Forces,</i>

58:04.361 --> 58:07.820
<i>Andrzej Przewoznik, Council for the
War and Martyrdom Sites,</i>

58:08.070 --> 58:11.611
<i>Maciej Plazynski, Chairman,
World Polish Council,</i>

58:11.820 --> 58:14.320
<i>Janusz Kochanowski,
Human Rights Spokesman,</i>

58:14.528 --> 58:17.403
<i>Slawomir Skrzypek, Chairman,

<i>Janusz Krupski, Office for War Veterans

<i>Anna Walentynowicz,

58:28.903 --> 58:33.820
<i>Lieutenant General, Bronislaw Kwiatkowski,
Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces</i>

58:34.197 --> 58:37.049
<i>Lieutenant General, Andrzej Błasik,
Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force</i>

01:02:38.736 --> 01:02:40.820
Kamil?

01:02:41.851 --> 01:02:43.934
What are you doing here?

01:02:44.019 --> 01:02:46.103
I came to see you.

01:02:47.152 --> 01:02:49.318
Did you write any good poetry?

01:02:51.074 --> 01:02:52.866
I haven't written since the crash...

01:02:53.225 --> 01:02:54.891
I work here.

01:02:55.473 --> 01:02:57.937
Pity, it's good material.

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:01.151
But how?

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:06.111
You've left the University?
Young Poland?

01:03:09.398 --> 01:03:11.398
And what about you?

01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:15.601
- Have you tested your theory?
- Which one?

01:03:16.968 --> 01:03:20.509
That Mercury is a moon of Venus...

01:03:20.915 --> 01:03:22.373
kicked away by a meteor

01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:25.861
and pushed into solar orbit...

01:03:26.653 --> 01:03:28.736
that's obvious.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.383
Why didn't you turn
onto the hard shoulder?

01:03:34.796 --> 01:03:37.197
He was coming straight at us.

01:03:58.729 --> 01:04:02.593
He should have turned,
he was in our lane.

01:04:04.703 --> 01:04:10.495
If we'd both turned off at the
same time even you'd be dead.

01:04:11.861 --> 01:04:13.945
I'd prefer that...

01:04:15.346 --> 01:04:16.513
I think.

01:04:16.734 --> 01:04:19.776
Yes. People are perfectionists.

01:04:20.499 --> 01:04:24.999
They love cleanliness,
order and final solutions.

01:04:25.473 --> 01:04:29.890
But luckily there's God
who makes mistakes.

01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:32.622
Night.

01:04:33.007 --> 01:04:35.007
Four in the morning.

01:04:36.293 --> 01:04:38.376
Silence everywhere...

01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:44.654
I hear a woman sobbing
behind the wall.

01:04:47.424 --> 01:04:49.049
No...

01:04:49.914 --> 01:04:52.748
I think she's laughing.

01:04:54.506 --> 01:04:55.922
Yes.

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:02.120
I couldn't sleep last night.

01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:04.958
<i>It's impossible, I thought.</i>

01:05:05.043 --> 01:05:07.574
<i>Laughter can't sound
so similar to crying...</i>

01:05:07.954 --> 01:05:10.209
<i>they're opposites.</i>

01:05:11.381 --> 01:05:13.923
<i>Opposites are always
close to one another.</i>

01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:18.935
<i>So maybe in heaven they think
that we're always laughing.</i>

01:05:33.878 --> 01:05:36.392
<i>Air traffic over Europe
has been paralyzed.</i>

01:05:36.477 --> 01:05:40.476
<i>Clouds of volcanic dust are
drifting over from Iceland.</i>

01:05:40.709 --> 01:05:44.418
<i>According to experts, the ash
could cause engine seizures...</i>

01:05:44.584 --> 01:05:47.751
<i>The phenomenon of the volcanic dust,
which floats over Europe</i>

01:05:47.959 --> 01:05:50.293
<i>is extremely rare in our region,</i>

01:05:50.584 --> 01:05:53.992
<i>emphasises Grzegorz Sobczak,
editor of "Winged Poland".</i>

01:05:54.215 --> 01:05:55.249
<i>When will the dust settle?</i>

01:05:55.334 --> 01:05:57.372
<i>There are various forecasts,
because from what I hear</i>

01:05:57.543 --> 01:06:01.709
<i>the situation could sort
itself out in a day or two.</i>

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:06.575
<i>In a critical situation we could wait
up to seven days for a change.</i>

01:06:06.955 --> 01:06:11.501
<i>The cloud might disrupt weekend memorial
ceremonies in Krakow and Warsaw.</i>

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.626
<i>Yesterday 6000 flights were
canceled in Europe alone.</i>

01:06:14.787 --> 01:06:17.952
<i>Many transatlantic flights
were canceled as well.</i>

01:06:18.037 --> 01:06:20.949
<i>In spite of these difficulties, President
Barack Obama is still planning</i>

01:06:21.034 --> 01:06:24.600
<i>to travel to Poland for the funeral
of President Lech Kaczynski and his wife.</i>

01:06:24.926 --> 01:06:29.334
<i>The plan is that around 80 planes
will land at Krakow's airport</i>

01:06:29.543 --> 01:06:32.564
<i>with members of the delegations which will
participate in Sunday's funeral</i>

01:06:32.649 --> 01:06:34.709
<i>of the presidential couple.</i>

01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:37.959
<i>More bodies return to Poland.</i>

01:06:38.097 --> 01:06:40.959
<i>First came the plane with the body of
former president Ryszard Kaczorowski.</i>

01:06:41.168 --> 01:06:43.835
<i>The next one brought
34 coffins to Warsaw.</i>

01:06:44.122 --> 01:06:46.668
<i>Families waited at the airport.</i>

01:06:46.876 --> 01:06:48.543
<i>Prime Minister Donald Tusk says</i>

01:06:48.757 --> 01:06:53.175
<i>that Poland will remember the victims
of the tragedy and their legacy.</i>

01:06:53.449 --> 01:07:00.905
<i>We will carry on your dreams
of a better world, of truth.</i>

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:07.126
<i>Each of you served
as best you could.</i>

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:14.168
<i>We, as best we can, will
wish to hold up your legacy</i>

01:07:14.376 --> 01:07:18.043
<i>and carry it onward.</i>

01:07:18.855 --> 01:07:23.959
<i>If someone plants a bomb on a plane
you think, he's gonna say he did it?</i>

01:07:24.101 --> 01:07:27.168
<i>C'mon, what would they gain
exploding a bomb in a plane?</i>

01:07:27.272 --> 01:07:33.501
<i>What gain? The President and the most
important people in Poland were on it.</i>

01:07:33.834 --> 01:07:39.501
<i>Ruskies are guilty, they should give
all the documents, show everything...</i>

01:07:39.709 --> 01:07:42.043
<i>But they are covering it up,
showing nothing!</i>

01:24:31.349 --> 01:24:32.891
Do you hear?

01:24:33.349 --> 01:24:35.937
You need treatment.

01:24:41.391 --> 01:24:43.474
A priest came to see me.

01:24:45.099 --> 01:24:48.432
Listen, we're all worried
about you, understand?

01:24:50.016 --> 01:24:52.307
<i>We're worried.</i>

01:24:53.432 --> 01:24:56.266
<i>And answer that bloody
phone, will you?!</i>

01:25:08.654 --> 01:25:11.834
<i>O senseless strivings
of the mortal round!</i>

01:25:12.301 --> 01:25:18.433
<i>How worthless is that exercise of reason
that makes you beat your wings into the ground!</i>

01:25:19.057 --> 01:25:24.208
<i>One man was giving himself
to low, and one to aphorisms,</i>

01:25:24.555 --> 01:25:31.295
<i>one sought sinecures, and one to rule
by force or sly persuasion,</i>

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.703
<i>one planned his business,
one his robberies,</i>

01:25:37.625 --> 01:25:41.917
<i>one, tangled in the pleasure
of the flesh, wore himself out,</i>

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:45.259
<i>and one lounged at his ease,</i>

01:25:46.599 --> 01:25:50.425
<i>while I, of all such
vanities relieved</i>

01:25:51.498 --> 01:25:53.939
<i>hang high in Heaven
with my Beatrice,</i>

01:25:54.024 --> 01:25:57.056
<i>arose to glory,
gloriously received.</i>

01:25:58.766 --> 01:26:02.387
<i>When each had danced his circuit</i>

01:26:02.731 --> 01:26:05.142
<i>and come back to the same
point of the circle,</i>

01:26:05.328 --> 01:26:09.684
<i>all stood still, like votive
candles glowing in a rack.</i>

01:26:11.307 --> 01:26:16.554
<i>And I saw the splendor of the blazing
ray that had spoken to me...</i>

01:26:29.766 --> 01:26:33.396
<i>O sparkling essence
of the Holy Spirit!</i>

01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:36.568
<i>How instantly it
blazed before my eyes,</i>

01:26:36.653 --> 01:26:40.198
<i>defeating them with glory,
their function lost!</i>

01:26:41.724 --> 01:26:44.638
<i>But Beatrice let
herself appear to me</i>

01:26:44.723 --> 01:26:52.531
<i>so glad in beauty that the vision must lie
with those whose glory outdoes memory.</i>

01:26:53.367 --> 01:26:57.869
<i>From her I drew again the power
of sight and looked up,</i>

01:26:58.509 --> 01:27:03.725
<i>and I saw myself translated, with her
alone, to the next estate of light.</i>

01:27:04.883 --> 01:27:07.974
<i>I was made aware
that I had risen higher</i>

01:27:08.024 --> 01:27:10.880
<i>by the enkindled ardor
of the red star that glowed,</i>

01:27:10.965 --> 01:27:13.676
<i>I thought, with more
than usual fire.</i>

01:27:14.224 --> 01:27:18.796
<i>With all my heart, and in the tongue
which is one in all men,</i>

01:27:19.243 --> 01:27:22.332
<i>I offered God my soul
as offering for this new bliss.</i>
