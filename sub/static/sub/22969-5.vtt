00:17.834 --> 00:19.268
[alarm buzzing]

00:38.822 --> 00:41.056
Mom!

00:42.459 --> 00:43.760
Mom!

00:43.761 --> 00:45.595
Dad!

00:45.596 --> 00:47.931
So... something happened.

00:47.932 --> 00:50.465
I just woke up and I'm...

00:51.668 --> 00:53.436
Old.

00:53.437 --> 00:55.238
- Pete?
- Petey?

00:55.239 --> 00:58.040
Mom? Dad? No!

01:05.849 --> 01:07.050
Wha?

01:07.051 --> 01:09.251
Good heavens! Is that you?

01:11.321 --> 01:15.291
[murmuring]

01:15.292 --> 01:17.026
Wha?

01:36.913 --> 01:39.516
Baird: An entire town
turning old overnight.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.684
- How is that even possible?
- It's not. It's magical.

01:41.685 --> 01:45.822
- Or maybe it's a time bubble.
- Yeah. Or it's Florida.

01:45.823 --> 01:48.992
Oh. I love old people holding hands.

01:48.993 --> 01:51.227
Hey, I'm 22.

01:51.228 --> 01:52.829
Sorry. Sorry.

01:52.830 --> 01:55.165
Clipping book mentioned
the Worth family.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.667
They were the first residents
to phone in the incident.

01:57.668 --> 02:00.370
According to New Weedon census,
they live on Queen Street.

02:00.371 --> 02:04.073
"New Weedon." This whole town is
barely older than that yoga circle.

02:04.074 --> 02:06.134
Or it could be a curse.
Maybe this town's

02:06.147 --> 02:08.144
built on, like, an old
people graveyard.

02:08.145 --> 02:10.213
Or a graveyard.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.614
Flynn and I will interview the Worths.

02:11.615 --> 02:13.583
You three snoop around,
see what you can dig up.

02:13.584 --> 02:18.087
- Come with me, young man.
- After you, young lady.

02:18.088 --> 02:20.557
Okay.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.358
Oh, um, excuse me, sir?

02:22.359 --> 02:24.661
Could, uh, we ask you
a few quick... ju...

02:24.662 --> 02:25.616
Mommy! Mama!

02:25.617 --> 02:28.431
Ezekiel: I think you
just scared off her baby.

02:28.432 --> 02:31.733
All right, this is weird, even for us.

02:33.970 --> 02:35.170
[doorbell rings]

02:38.341 --> 02:39.576
- Mrs. Worth?
- Yes?

02:39.577 --> 02:42.679
- I'm Flynn Carsen.
- Are you a journalist?

02:42.680 --> 02:46.181
No, I'm a Librarian.

02:49.552 --> 02:54.591
Mmm, mmm. Thank you
for the lemonade, Mrs. Worth.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.993
Cathy, please.

02:56.994 --> 02:59.729
And this is my husband Pete.

02:59.730 --> 03:04.734
And this is Pete Junior.
Uh, was Pete Junior.

03:04.735 --> 03:07.103
Can you tell us what happened?

03:07.104 --> 03:10.640
I was making breakfast.
Pete was in bed.

03:10.641 --> 03:13.309
It was the big game last night.
We let him sleep in.

03:13.310 --> 03:16.312
I'm quarterback. Go, Geese.

03:16.313 --> 03:19.115
And then there was this big flash.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.417
A big red flash and...

03:21.418 --> 03:23.086
and then we were like this.

03:23.087 --> 03:27.123
- A red flash?
- Yeah, like a light bulb popping.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.891
Nothing else out of the ordinary?

03:28.892 --> 03:30.460
Not that I can think of.

03:30.461 --> 03:33.763
Look, are... are we going
to be stuck like this forever?

03:33.764 --> 03:38.067
I... I used to be 45.
I was really good at being 45.

03:38.068 --> 03:40.370
- Don't worry, we'll fix this.
- Okay.

03:40.371 --> 03:43.840
Peter, what have I told you
about texting in company?

03:43.841 --> 03:45.475
Mom.

03:45.476 --> 03:49.145
Flynn, I wonder if this turning
old thing is contagious.

03:49.146 --> 03:53.582
Aging's not viral. I think we're okay.

03:56.419 --> 03:59.122
Do you guys think I'm gonna
be good at being old?

03:59.123 --> 04:00.690
What do you mean, good at it?

04:00.691 --> 04:04.827
I don't know. I just never
thought I'd get an old age.

04:04.828 --> 04:08.231
Brain grape.
Should I start practicing?

04:08.232 --> 04:10.033
Hey, hey.

04:10.034 --> 04:13.603
It's a girl. Like, a girl, girl.

04:13.604 --> 04:16.606
Excuse me, could we ask you
a few question... wait!

04:16.607 --> 04:18.675
- Wait! Oh, wait, wait!
- No, no. No.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.310
[phone ringing]

04:21.312 --> 04:22.299
Cass?

04:22.300 --> 04:24.314
Baird, we found a clue,
and she's running.

04:24.315 --> 04:25.948
<i>I'll send you our location.</i>

04:25.949 --> 04:28.418
Got it. Excuse us.

04:28.419 --> 04:31.119
Time to go.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.327
- Hello?
- Hello?

04:37.328 --> 04:39.028
Listen, I know it's scary

04:39.029 --> 04:41.497
when there's a bunch
of people chasing you.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.933
- [sobbing]
- But...

04:43.934 --> 04:45.368
Over there.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.271
[sobbing continues]

04:48.272 --> 04:50.740
Hey. Hey.

04:50.741 --> 04:53.943
You don't need to cry.
We're... we're here to help.

04:53.944 --> 04:56.112
- We're... uh.
- What the...

04:56.113 --> 04:59.482
Ezekiel: It's crying,
but I don't think it's scared.

04:59.483 --> 05:02.485
No, scared would be us.

05:02.486 --> 05:04.354
- All right, back it up.
- Okay.

05:04.355 --> 05:05.588
Guys?

05:05.589 --> 05:08.424
- [creatures grunting]
- There's more of them.

05:08.425 --> 05:10.460
Okay, uh...

05:10.461 --> 05:12.161
- Ooh! Uh!
- Hey, hey.

05:12.162 --> 05:15.397
[creatures grunting]

05:19.969 --> 05:21.871
[grunting]

05:21.872 --> 05:22.905
- Oh.
- [grunting]

05:22.906 --> 05:25.375
No! Whoa! Hey!

05:25.376 --> 05:30.445
Ahoy! Ahoy! Look out below!

05:35.918 --> 05:38.821
Begone, foul gargoyles! Begone!

05:38.822 --> 05:42.157
- [device whirring]
- [creatures moaning]

05:43.893 --> 05:46.996
What the... who... who are you?

05:46.997 --> 05:51.401
I am the Librarian.

05:51.402 --> 05:53.603
What?

05:57.548 --> 06:00.584
Wh... wh... what do you
mean you're the Librarian?

06:00.585 --> 06:04.088
I mean, I am the Librarian,
but you may call me Dare.

06:04.089 --> 06:07.133
And you may pass me
that two point by four

06:07.146 --> 06:09.894
standard fluted crosshair screwdriver.

06:09.895 --> 06:13.264
We're here.
We're not getting any younger.

06:13.265 --> 06:14.532
Who's he?

06:14.533 --> 06:17.067
He is the Librarian, apparently.

06:17.068 --> 06:20.404
And we may call him Dare.

06:20.405 --> 06:22.572
Dare?

06:24.275 --> 06:25.943
Not Darrington Dare?

06:25.944 --> 06:27.044
- The very same.
- No!

06:27.045 --> 06:28.345
- Yes! Yes!
- No. Get out!

06:28.346 --> 06:30.514
- Get out of what?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.720
Who the hell is Darrington Dare?

06:31.721 --> 06:33.722
He's a man who needs
a smaller screwdriver.

06:33.723 --> 06:35.490
It's a Pocket Banshee.
He's got a Pocket Banshee!

06:35.491 --> 06:37.225
Allow me, sir! Please, please, please.

06:37.226 --> 06:39.494
Ratchet head, magnetic insulated grip.
No, no, no.

06:39.495 --> 06:40.962
None of these are good enough
for Darrington Dare.

06:40.963 --> 06:42.564
Darrington Dare's probably...
not probably...

06:42.565 --> 06:44.799
Darrington Dare is the greatest
Librarian of all time.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.000
Darrington Dare,
what are you doing here?

06:46.001 --> 06:47.635
You're from 130 years ago in the past.

06:47.636 --> 06:48.970
Correction. I'm from the present.

06:48.971 --> 06:50.371
You're from 130 years in the future.

06:50.372 --> 06:52.240
[imitates explosion]

06:52.241 --> 06:54.075
- Oh, my God! Darrington Dare!
- I am.

06:54.076 --> 06:55.677
- You are.
- He is?

06:55.678 --> 06:57.645
And who are you, good sir,
to know my life so intimately?

06:57.646 --> 07:02.851
Uh, well, Darrington, I can't believe
I'm about to say this to you,

07:02.852 --> 07:05.286
but I am a Librarian.

07:05.287 --> 07:09.390
And this is the screwdriver you need.

07:09.391 --> 07:11.326
Ah, it's the perfect fit.

07:11.327 --> 07:14.629
So you are the Librarian
of this age. Splendid.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.564
- Indeed.
- Both: Huzzah!

07:16.565 --> 07:19.667
- What are we? Backup dancers?
- That must make you his Guardian.

07:19.668 --> 07:21.536
The callous on your right hand
metacarpals mound

07:21.537 --> 07:23.805
indicates prolonged use of
firearm, military background,

07:23.806 --> 07:25.295
but your boots are
unpolished, suggesting

07:25.307 --> 07:26.641
you've been a civilian for some time.

07:26.642 --> 07:28.810
Your clothing is practical,
and yet you wear a necklace.

07:28.811 --> 07:30.845
You wish to appear attractive
to someone in the group.

07:30.846 --> 07:32.647
Your bootlaces are the
identical design to Flynn's.

07:32.648 --> 07:34.048
Probably bought at the same time.

07:34.049 --> 07:36.351
Man and woman
buying bootlaces together,

07:36.352 --> 07:38.019
that makes you a couple.

07:38.020 --> 07:41.756
[sputters] Okay, this is
where I get it from, okay.

07:41.757 --> 07:44.692
Mr. Dare...

07:44.693 --> 07:46.327
I'm a fan. I'm... I'm a fan.

07:46.328 --> 07:47.829
- No, no. Darrington, please.
- Oh, okay.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.531
We'll just call each other
by our first names, I guess.

07:49.532 --> 07:50.765
I'm Flynn. [chuckles]

07:50.766 --> 07:52.967
Maybe we could get back
to saving the day.

07:52.968 --> 07:55.403
Of course, Mr. Stone.
My humblest apologies.

07:55.404 --> 07:57.372
Hey. Hey, how do you know my name?

07:57.373 --> 07:59.174
It's written on the inside
of your shirt collar.

07:59.175 --> 08:01.409
Now, I'm of the surest
certainty that with the aid

08:01.410 --> 08:03.478
of the Guardian
and the Librarian of this age,

08:03.479 --> 08:05.413
plus their assistants, of course,

08:05.414 --> 08:08.516
that the peril that has brought me
forward in time shall be thwarted.

08:08.517 --> 08:11.352
Now come. We reconnoiter
at the chophouse!

08:11.353 --> 08:13.221
I never do this,
but can I get an autograph?

08:13.222 --> 08:15.423
- Both: Assistants?
- The chophouse?

08:15.424 --> 08:18.893
Is Flynn crying?

08:18.894 --> 08:21.995
[grunting]

08:28.503 --> 08:31.939
[grunting]

08:32.974 --> 08:34.573
So?

08:35.909 --> 08:37.645
Ah, good.

08:37.645 --> 08:43.284
It's about time Darrington showed up.

08:43.284 --> 08:48.122
And the other Librarian
from the present day?

08:48.123 --> 08:51.291
[grunting]

08:54.963 --> 08:56.831
Four of them?

08:56.832 --> 08:58.566
How is that possible?

08:58.567 --> 09:01.169
[grunts]

09:01.170 --> 09:06.074
Well, that's just
making it too much fun.

09:06.075 --> 09:08.843
[chuckles]

09:08.844 --> 09:11.646
Go. You know what to do.

09:11.647 --> 09:13.814
[grunting]

09:16.484 --> 09:20.121
Excuse me? Could we order, please?

09:20.122 --> 09:22.357
Oh, this fast food is gonna be slow.

09:22.358 --> 09:24.359
What a peculiar chophouse.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.361
It's called a diner, mate.

09:26.362 --> 09:30.098
I deduce from your accent that the
colony of Australia is still with us.

09:30.099 --> 09:32.767
Good for you. Keep it up.

09:32.768 --> 09:37.071
What are you doing here, Darrington?

09:37.072 --> 09:38.473
Flynn, if you know who I am,

09:38.474 --> 09:41.175
then you also know who
my counterpoint is.

09:41.176 --> 09:43.878
The darker version of myself.

09:43.879 --> 09:46.180
- You don't mean...
- Both: Ambrose Gethic.

09:46.181 --> 09:48.950
- The very same.
- Who's Ambrose Gethic?

09:48.951 --> 09:51.753
My greatest nemesis. My oldest enemy.

09:51.754 --> 09:53.321
Moriarty to his Holmes.

09:53.322 --> 09:56.791
Yes. Conan Doyle based his
detective on me, you know?

09:56.792 --> 09:58.526
Apparently it was supposed
to be a compliment.

09:58.527 --> 10:02.130
How can a buffalo have wings?

10:02.131 --> 10:05.099
Ambrose Gethic was a wizard
of phenomenal power

10:05.100 --> 10:06.634
who managed to combine
the ancient art of magic

10:06.635 --> 10:09.237
with the new technologies
of the electric age.

10:09.238 --> 10:10.338
He's a pioneer. Genius.

10:10.339 --> 10:11.940
A devil, and he is here.

10:11.941 --> 10:13.608
Wait, in this town? Now?

10:13.609 --> 10:15.710
It all began when he stole
the Bleeding Crown

10:15.711 --> 10:17.412
of the Vampire Queen of Northampton.

10:17.413 --> 10:18.813
- Bleeding Crown?
- Yeah.

10:18.814 --> 10:21.416
That's a very famous
para-parasitic artifact.

10:21.417 --> 10:22.817
It has a red ruby in the middle

10:22.818 --> 10:25.153
that belonged
to Elizabeth Bathory, okay?

10:25.154 --> 10:26.888
The Hungarian Blood Countess.

10:26.889 --> 10:28.456
Tales of it are legend.

10:28.457 --> 10:30.959
Worse. Tales of it are true.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.394
<i>I traced Gethic back to
his lair in London</i>

10:33.395 --> 10:35.363
<i>in an attempt to retrieve the Crown,</i>

10:35.364 --> 10:37.364
<i>but he was expecting me.</i>

10:41.002 --> 10:43.838
<i>The Vampire Queen's crown
has the power</i>

10:43.839 --> 10:45.839
<i>to drain a man's life force.</i>

10:50.244 --> 10:52.013
<i>And my manservant Carstairs</i>

10:52.014 --> 10:54.548
<i>was the first to succumb to its curse.</i>

11:00.288 --> 11:03.491
<i>Now, fortunately, after a
lifetime locked in mortal combat,</i>

11:03.492 --> 11:07.261
I've learned to defend myself
against Gethic's dark arts.

11:07.262 --> 11:08.997
- [gasps]
- Anti-magic tattoos.

11:08.998 --> 11:11.332
A gift from the shaman priests
of Shamutanti.

11:11.333 --> 11:15.570
<i>But before I could stop him, Gethic
opened up a portal in space and time</i>

11:15.571 --> 11:19.106
<i>and escaped, taking the Crown
and his creatures with him.</i>

11:21.442 --> 11:22.810
<i>I followed him through,</i>

11:22.811 --> 11:24.245
<i>but we arrived at different moments.</i>

11:24.246 --> 11:25.713
<i>I've been here but a few hours.</i>

11:25.714 --> 11:28.016
Gethic's been here several months.

11:28.017 --> 11:30.418
So those things that attacked us?

11:30.419 --> 11:33.187
Gethic's reduplicates.

11:33.188 --> 11:39.727
Ah, how to explain
such a complex concept?

11:39.728 --> 11:42.930
Let us imagine a man can create
a tangible likeness of himself,

11:42.931 --> 11:44.766
a simulacra of his own being,

11:44.767 --> 11:47.301
a... a replica, a doppelganger, a...

11:47.302 --> 11:49.470
- All: A clone?
- Yes, a clone.

11:49.471 --> 11:51.939
Now, this is my Pocket Banshee.

11:51.940 --> 11:55.475
It emits a sonic blast that
the clones find unbearable.

11:57.311 --> 11:59.347
Could we just get six glasses
of water, please?

11:59.348 --> 12:00.982
[sighs]

12:00.983 --> 12:05.253
Ambrose Gethic perfected the art
of cloning back in the late 1880s.

12:05.254 --> 12:07.288
Darrington: <i>Well, not perfected.</i>

12:07.289 --> 12:09.857
<i>As you've seen,
he cannot stabilize skin.</i>

12:09.858 --> 12:11.459
<i>Something about the cellular structure</i>

12:11.460 --> 12:13.494
<i>of the human epidermis eluded him.</i>

12:13.495 --> 12:15.729
<i>His clones quickly degenerate.</i>

12:22.236 --> 12:24.472
But make no mistake, his creations are

12:24.473 --> 12:27.241
preternaturally powerful,
decidedly dangerous.

12:27.242 --> 12:30.812
Gadzooks! Must I die of
thirst in this alehouse?

12:30.813 --> 12:32.913
I will attend to you, sir.

12:34.549 --> 12:38.686
Hello! Green stuff, meet gin.

12:38.687 --> 12:42.290
So, did Gethic use the Bleeding
Crown to oldify the town?

12:42.291 --> 12:44.358
- Indubitably.
- Yeah, but why come all the way

12:44.359 --> 12:46.092
to the future just to do that?

12:48.229 --> 12:52.233
I call it a Darrington Dare
because you must be both brave

12:52.234 --> 12:53.967
and strong to drink it.

12:59.006 --> 13:01.476
Mmm. How refreshing.

13:01.477 --> 13:03.543
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

13:05.880 --> 13:08.983
There must be something here
today that Ambrose Gethic wants,

13:08.984 --> 13:11.319
and we must find it before
he does, or else this time,

13:11.320 --> 13:14.755
nay, all of time,
shall be in dire peril.

13:14.756 --> 13:16.724
Also, I seem to have discovered

13:16.725 --> 13:19.393
the most extraordinarily
small umbrella.

13:19.394 --> 13:21.629
It goes in the drink.

13:21.630 --> 13:25.600
It goes in the drink? How marvelous.

13:25.601 --> 13:30.538
Try this. It's strong, smooth,
and full of character.

13:30.539 --> 13:33.173
I call it the Flynn Carsen.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.376
He calls it the Flynn Carsen.

13:43.151 --> 13:45.820
Ooh. Didn't know you were that strong.

13:45.821 --> 13:48.189
So what date have you jumped
forward from, Darrington?

13:48.190 --> 13:49.757
August 5th, 1888.

13:49.758 --> 13:50.858
- Day before your birthday.
- Yeah.

13:50.859 --> 13:51.859
You know when his birthday is?

13:51.860 --> 13:53.361
Of course I know his birthday.

13:53.362 --> 13:56.330
In fact, it is the day
before my 40th birthday,

13:56.331 --> 13:59.233
so it marks quite the milestone.

13:59.234 --> 14:01.235
Zounds!

14:01.236 --> 14:06.607
A self-actuating,
automated coffee machine.

14:06.608 --> 14:10.377
Upon my word. 'Tis a thing of beauty.

14:12.146 --> 14:13.613
What is it, Flynn?

14:15.416 --> 14:19.420
Darrington Dare's 40th birthday...

14:19.421 --> 14:21.622
he's alone, he's obsessed with work,

14:21.623 --> 14:23.157
he never had any time for friends,

14:23.158 --> 14:25.159
and he's attacked by
the Serpent Brotherhood...

14:25.160 --> 14:29.062
- and killed.
- We have to warn him.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.568
We can't. I mean,
what happened happened.

14:33.569 --> 14:36.037
It's against the rules.

14:36.038 --> 14:38.272
Win or lose, we send Darrington Dare

14:38.273 --> 14:40.775
home to his death tomorrow.

14:44.969 --> 14:46.470
All right, what's the plan?

14:46.471 --> 14:47.471
Flynn?

14:47.472 --> 14:49.874
You're asking me? He's asking me.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.676
Of course he is,
'cause I'm the Librarian.

14:51.677 --> 14:54.378
Well, obviously the girl is the clue,
so we should find her at once.

14:54.379 --> 14:57.882
Eve, you and Cassandra, Ezekiel,
and Stone should check uptown.

14:57.883 --> 14:59.316
What would that leave?

14:59.317 --> 15:00.985
You and I shall be banded together.

15:00.986 --> 15:03.287
Ah, so it does. [chuckles]

15:03.288 --> 15:05.523
What a coi... what a coincidence.

15:05.524 --> 15:06.891
I... unless that's...

15:06.892 --> 15:09.393
Go be a fanboy to your
hero of heroes, Flynn.

15:09.394 --> 15:11.362
- Can I? 'Cause Darrington Dare...
- I get it.

15:11.363 --> 15:12.963
It's just like when I met Cinderella.

15:12.964 --> 15:14.999
Admittedly, I was six and
it was cute, acceptable,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.902
but I get it.

15:17.903 --> 15:20.071
Ah.

15:20.072 --> 15:21.671
Ahoy! Ahoy!

15:27.211 --> 15:29.412
The hunt is on.

15:33.484 --> 15:35.386
So, Jones, who's your hero?

15:35.387 --> 15:37.722
Uh, after me,
it'd probably have to be...

15:37.723 --> 15:39.390
me. What about you?

15:39.391 --> 15:42.093
Well, I guess my mom, my dad.

15:42.094 --> 15:44.695
- And Cinderella?
- She was good.

15:44.696 --> 15:47.631
Until I saw "Alien," and then
it was Ripley all the way.

15:47.632 --> 15:49.467
- Oh.
- Einstein, obviously.

15:49.468 --> 15:54.672
Uh, Newton, Pythagoras, Emmy
Noether, Turing, Stephen Hawking.

15:54.673 --> 15:57.708
When you grow up a math nerd, you
have a lot of potential heroes.

15:57.709 --> 16:00.144
- Jake, you?
- Da Vinci, of course.

16:00.145 --> 16:02.179
Michelangelo, Klimt.

16:02.180 --> 16:03.914
Can't forget about my boy,
Paulo Coehlo.

16:03.915 --> 16:06.617
But as a kid, probably my dog.

16:06.618 --> 16:08.753
- Your dog is your hero? That's so cool.
- Shh.

16:08.754 --> 16:11.655
- [music box playing]
- Do you guys hear that?

16:11.656 --> 16:15.892
[music box continues]

16:19.497 --> 16:22.199
You lead a good team, Flynn.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.834
I approve of your assistants.

16:23.835 --> 16:26.604
Actually, not my assistants.
They're also Librarians.

16:26.605 --> 16:28.572
What?

16:28.573 --> 16:30.441
There are four Librarians?

16:30.442 --> 16:33.577
Good God, man. Don't you
see how dangerous this is?

16:33.578 --> 16:36.280
For centuries, there has
been one unbreakable rule.

16:36.281 --> 16:38.015
There can only be one Librarian.

16:38.016 --> 16:40.918
But the Library chose
all of us to defeat Apep, so...

16:40.919 --> 16:45.322
Yes, and if he is defeated,
you are all no longer required.

16:45.323 --> 16:48.292
History shows that if there is
ever more than one Librarian,

16:48.293 --> 16:50.628
war shall come between them.
War, Flynn.

16:50.629 --> 16:52.663
War until the Library is ripped apart.

16:52.664 --> 16:55.099
War that all humanity will suffer.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.502
Swear to me, swear to me that if
you are the one true Librarian,

16:58.503 --> 17:01.070
you will fix this God awful mess.

17:03.073 --> 17:04.974
Fix it, yeah.

17:04.976 --> 17:06.143
Fix it how?

17:06.144 --> 17:08.311
You must fire the others
from the Library.

17:08.313 --> 17:10.314
- Immediately.
- Darrington, I...

17:10.315 --> 17:11.662
Give me your word, Flynn.
You will do this.

17:11.663 --> 17:13.782
Darrington, I... Darrington, I... I...

17:15.920 --> 17:17.021
- Darrington!
- What?

17:17.021 --> 17:18.823
There!

17:18.824 --> 17:22.858
This conversation will be continued!

17:32.937 --> 17:38.174
[music box playing]

17:40.010 --> 17:43.380
Nothing gets your attention
like a creepy little music box.

17:43.381 --> 17:46.550
[music box continues]

17:46.551 --> 17:48.352
"Auld Lang Syne."

17:48.353 --> 17:50.721
"Should old acquaintance be forgot."

17:50.722 --> 17:55.291
You think it's a message from
Gethic to Darrington Dare?

18:02.633 --> 18:04.235
A.G.?

18:04.236 --> 18:05.536
Ambrose Gethic.

18:05.537 --> 18:08.071
Yeah. But why is it here?

18:10.441 --> 18:11.842
I don't know.

18:11.843 --> 18:14.812
Unless it's a trap.

18:14.813 --> 18:17.547
[grunting]

18:26.290 --> 18:27.658
So that must be home.

18:27.659 --> 18:30.326
What would you say
to the direct approach?

18:38.369 --> 18:40.036
[clicking]

18:45.175 --> 18:46.510
Go away.

18:46.511 --> 18:50.414
Sir, if we could just, uh,
have a moment of your time.

18:50.415 --> 18:53.617
- Woman: Who is it, Kyle?
- I'm handling it. I said go away.

18:53.618 --> 18:57.387
Sir, we are Librarians.

19:05.229 --> 19:06.864
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

19:06.865 --> 19:09.966
[both chuckle]

19:15.406 --> 19:16.579
How are you still young?

19:16.580 --> 19:18.842
I was going to ask
you the same question.

19:18.843 --> 19:21.745
We thought it must be contagious,
everyone getting old.

19:21.746 --> 19:23.981
- I told you to stay inside, Jess.
- Sorry, Dad.

19:23.982 --> 19:26.383
No, no. We're sorry. We
didn't mean to scare anyone.

19:26.384 --> 19:29.386
Can you think why the rest of the
town has aged and you have not?

19:29.387 --> 19:34.491
No. We just woke up like this
and they woke up like... that.

19:34.492 --> 19:37.393
Both: Hmm.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.564
Ah-ha.

19:45.235 --> 19:47.771
Ah-ha.

19:47.772 --> 19:49.506
- Both: The electricity.
- The unpaid notices.

19:49.507 --> 19:51.342
- The use of candles.
- The broken doorbell.

19:51.343 --> 19:52.876
Your power's been turned off.

19:52.877 --> 19:54.111
Yeah. It's been a rough month.

19:54.112 --> 19:55.546
No, it's been your lucky month.

19:55.547 --> 19:57.815
You have no electricity.
That's why you are unharmed.

19:57.816 --> 20:00.851
That's how he aged the town. Gethic has
been mixing magic with electricity.

20:00.852 --> 20:02.786
He's wired the Crown
to the power supply.

20:02.787 --> 20:04.221
Is there a power station near here?

20:04.222 --> 20:06.290
Yeah, there's Mayfield
Electric near the river.

20:06.291 --> 20:09.760
Come, Flynn, together we may yet
prevail against the forces of evil.

20:09.761 --> 20:11.095
"Indubilidy."

20:11.096 --> 20:13.564
Indubitably. Indu...

20:13.565 --> 20:15.532
- Yes, we will.
- Ah.

20:15.533 --> 20:18.502
[grunts]

20:18.503 --> 20:21.105
Of course, we wi... what?

20:21.106 --> 20:26.110
Flynn? Something's happened.

20:38.002 --> 20:41.105
Ah, Mr. Carsen. Well, did
you unravel the mystery

20:41.106 --> 20:42.640
of the town of the elderly?

20:42.641 --> 20:44.442
More like the mystery unraveled us.

20:44.443 --> 20:47.878
What? Is this... Oh, my!
Dear Lord! Are they...

20:47.879 --> 20:50.381
- I'm tired.
- I'm thirsty.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.416
- It's too hot in here.
- I'm too cold.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.151
- Can we get them some chairs?
- Oh.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.576
It turns out they like to sit down.
A lot.

20:56.577 --> 20:57.688
Uh-huh. Please.

20:57.689 --> 21:00.324
Let's go. Sit down.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.526
Stop that! Stupid old fingers.

21:02.527 --> 21:03.894
What happened to them?

21:03.895 --> 21:06.731
Eve, you want to tell
Jenkins what happened?

21:06.732 --> 21:08.466
This chair's too hard.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.935
- Um, Eve?
- Just focus, hon.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.137
You want to explain
to Jenkins what happened?

21:13.138 --> 21:17.441
I could focus harder
in a softer chair.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.944
Stone, do you want to tell
Jenkins what happened? Stone?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.312
[snoring]

21:21.313 --> 21:23.514
Mr. Stone?

21:23.515 --> 21:27.251
1874 was the year

21:27.252 --> 21:31.889
Monet gave the first
exhibition on impressionism.

21:31.890 --> 21:36.527
Is that so? Do you want to explain
to Jenkins what happened to you?

21:36.528 --> 21:38.429
- Do what?
- Cassandra: I'll tell you what happened.

21:38.430 --> 21:41.165
They got all up in our face
with the flashing

21:41.166 --> 21:43.400
and then the lights, and then, bam!

21:43.401 --> 21:45.636
We were old and I was tired.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.405
- What's she saying?
- She's talking too quiet.

21:48.406 --> 21:50.040
Too damn loud in here!

21:50.041 --> 21:51.976
Do any of these books
have the large print?

21:51.977 --> 21:53.677
I need them in the large print.

21:53.678 --> 21:55.880
Sir, I think maybe the laboratory.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.948
It's quiet and warm in there.

21:57.949 --> 21:59.583
- Oh!
- And softer chairs.

21:59.584 --> 22:02.119
We're gonna take you
someplace very comfortable.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.688
Yes. I'm not like this, am I, sir?

22:04.689 --> 22:07.624
No, Galahad. Far, far worse.

22:09.994 --> 22:12.830
Mr. Dare, what... how are you...

22:12.831 --> 22:14.398
I'm concerned, Galahad.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.634
Alarmed and concerned
that you of all people

22:16.635 --> 22:18.569
would allow a situation
like this to arise.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.638
Four Librarians? Four?

22:20.639 --> 22:21.906
I realize there are rules...

22:21.907 --> 22:24.275
Then you understand
why there are rules.

22:24.276 --> 22:28.946
It's time for Flynn to learn the
dark secret of our collective past.

22:28.947 --> 22:32.917
Galahad, bring forth
"The Book of Librarians."

22:32.918 --> 22:35.084
Yes, sir.

22:37.288 --> 22:42.326
This tome records the lives of every
Librarian ever to serve the Library.

22:42.327 --> 22:46.297
It's tempting to see how my
own story ends, but I shan't.

22:46.298 --> 22:49.433
No, I know all about "The Book
of Librarians," Darrington.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.635
It's the first book that I read
when I became a Librarian.

22:51.636 --> 22:52.903
It's how I know everything about you.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.739
Then you also know
about the missing pages.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.442
The ones that were ripped out, yeah.

22:58.443 --> 23:01.678
<i>Vasta lumi califraxi sol.</i>

23:07.785 --> 23:11.188
Now, let me tell you
a tale of the Library.

23:11.189 --> 23:14.225
Once there were two brothers, the
greatest minds of their age,

23:14.226 --> 23:17.995
Balthus and Zharradan, who lived
in 5th-Century Westphalia.

23:17.996 --> 23:19.496
When the time of calling came,

23:19.497 --> 23:22.733
the Library invited
the brothers for interview.

23:22.734 --> 23:27.304
They were twins of identical
intellect and outlook,

23:27.305 --> 23:29.139
and the Library couldn't
choose between them.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.008
And so in its wisdom, it chose both.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.043
But soon, the brothers became jealous,

23:33.044 --> 23:36.780
each believing he was more
suited to the role of Librarian,

23:36.781 --> 23:39.917
more deserving of the
Library's wisdom and power.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.619
And so they went to war.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.787
A war that escalated to a greater war

23:43.788 --> 23:45.322
that lasted nearly 1,000 years

23:45.323 --> 23:48.525
and almost destroyed the Library
they swore to protect.

23:48.526 --> 23:50.828
They caused the Dark Ages?

23:50.829 --> 23:54.498
Working for the Library
is more than a vocation.

23:54.499 --> 23:56.667
Those who move within its walls,

23:56.668 --> 24:00.204
be they Guardian
or Librarian or Custodian,

24:00.205 --> 24:04.642
they become infused
by the magic of the Library,

24:04.643 --> 24:07.878
and they take that magic
out into the world with them.

24:07.879 --> 24:09.980
You link the Library to the world

24:09.981 --> 24:12.549
as you link the world to the Library.

24:12.550 --> 24:14.518
But if there is war,

24:14.519 --> 24:16.487
if that connection is severed again,

24:16.488 --> 24:19.924
humanity will be cut adrift
from learning, from curiosity,

24:19.925 --> 24:23.193
from investigation,
knowledge, from wisdom,

24:23.194 --> 24:27.731
and a new era of fear, superstition,
and ignorance shall flourish.

24:27.732 --> 24:31.101
Yes, but these Librarians
would not go to war.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.870
- That's what the Library said last time.
- No, no.

24:32.871 --> 24:34.939
What he said is true.
We love the Library.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.907
- We wouldn't do anything to hurt it.
- Do you, Flynn?

24:36.908 --> 24:38.375
Do you love it fully and wholly

24:38.376 --> 24:40.673
- without doubt or distrust?
- I...

24:40.674 --> 24:42.212
Well, there you have it.
Cracks begin to show.

24:42.213 --> 24:44.081
And what about your friends? Are
they without doubt and distrust?

24:44.082 --> 24:45.849
- They...
- Yeah, more cracks. And what about when

24:45.850 --> 24:49.320
those cracks become fissures
and those fissures become war?

24:49.321 --> 24:51.789
Let us turn our minds
to matter of the present.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.057
- Galahad?
- Sir?

24:53.058 --> 24:54.892
That door can take us anywhere, yes?

24:54.893 --> 24:56.961
- Yes, sir. Anywhere.
- Take us to Mayfield Power Plant

24:56.962 --> 24:59.730
in New Weedon and to Ambrose Gethic.

24:59.731 --> 25:02.967
- You all right, Flynn?
- Yep, just needed a minute to think.

25:02.968 --> 25:04.568
Well, when we've defeated Gethic,

25:04.569 --> 25:06.170
we'll have all the thinking
time in the world.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.972
After you, my friend.

25:07.973 --> 25:10.240
Mr. Dare...

25:10.241 --> 25:13.142
You should have warned him.

25:22.286 --> 25:24.487
[snoring]

25:31.729 --> 25:34.764
They're so cute when they're asleep.

25:49.980 --> 25:52.782
What's he up to here?

25:56.120 --> 25:59.656
Ambrose: Darrington Dare.

25:59.657 --> 26:04.528
How good to see you
after all this time.

26:04.529 --> 26:06.129
[chuckles]

26:17.474 --> 26:21.712
Tell me, do you like
what I've done with the place?

26:21.713 --> 26:26.149
[grunting]

26:46.503 --> 26:48.972
Darrington! The Pocket Banshee.

26:48.973 --> 26:52.209
Not yet, Flynn. I must know his plan.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.078
What are you doing here, Ambrose?

26:54.079 --> 26:55.546
What do you want?

26:55.547 --> 26:59.283
Well, the only thing
either of us wants anymore.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.517
To destroy the other.

27:03.654 --> 27:08.692
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is

27:08.693 --> 27:11.962
when your greatest enemy
is immune to your power?

27:11.963 --> 27:15.032
I burn you.

27:15.033 --> 27:17.568
I freeze you.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.770
I turn you inside out.

27:23.874 --> 27:25.109
Nothing.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.345
But today...

27:28.346 --> 27:30.047
that changes.

27:30.048 --> 27:34.051
Your Bleeding Crown will have
no effect on me, Ambrose.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.186
I know, Darrington.

27:36.187 --> 27:41.058
It's not you it'll be affecting.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.559
What's in those tubes?

27:42.560 --> 27:45.762
Perhaps, you would like
a closer look, Flynn?

27:45.763 --> 27:47.131
Please, be my guest.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.967
[chuckles]
How stupid do you think I am?

27:49.968 --> 27:53.169
No, not how stupid. More how curious.

27:56.073 --> 27:58.675
- Now, hang on a minute.
- One little look.

27:58.676 --> 28:00.343
Well...

28:06.517 --> 28:08.118
Oh.

28:08.119 --> 28:12.122
After all these years
and all these battles,

28:12.123 --> 28:13.991
I've realized...

28:13.992 --> 28:15.759
there is one form of magic,
Darrington,

28:15.760 --> 28:18.362
that even you are vulnerable to.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.565
The magic of the Library itself.

28:21.566 --> 28:25.802
The magic that can be
harvested from a Librarian.

28:25.803 --> 28:27.571
Flynn, don't get too close
to those tubes.

28:27.572 --> 28:30.474
Oh, no, I don't mean him.
He's just a bonus.

28:30.475 --> 28:33.477
No, I already have everything I need.

28:33.478 --> 28:36.413
You needed Librarian energy
to defeat me,

28:36.414 --> 28:37.748
so you came into the future to get it,

28:37.749 --> 28:39.082
but you've already failed, Ambrose.

28:39.083 --> 28:41.985
Our Librarians are in the Library.

28:41.986 --> 28:47.089
Oh, Darrington,
those aren't your Librarians.

28:55.532 --> 28:58.535
Oh. Oh, wait.

28:58.536 --> 28:59.803
I... don't.

28:59.804 --> 29:00.771
[hisses]

29:00.772 --> 29:04.508
If you want to hide a needle,

29:04.509 --> 29:07.144
you don't hide it in a stack of hay.

29:07.145 --> 29:10.346
You hide it in a stack of needles.

29:11.648 --> 29:13.350
Cassandra? Are you all right?

29:13.351 --> 29:16.053
That's why I turned the town old.

29:16.054 --> 29:18.722
To conceal where the Librarians

29:18.723 --> 29:21.658
have really been all this time.

29:21.659 --> 29:23.694
And guess what?

29:23.695 --> 29:25.462
It worked.

29:25.463 --> 29:27.831
And now, with their energy,

29:27.832 --> 29:32.603
I shall kill Darrington Dare
once and for all.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.904
[creatures grunting]

29:33.905 --> 29:35.405
Put him in his tube.

29:35.406 --> 29:38.208
[creatures grunting]

29:38.209 --> 29:40.309
Flynn: Darrington!

29:42.112 --> 29:45.448
Now, Darrington...

29:49.386 --> 29:50.721
shall we dance?

30:14.241 --> 30:16.309
- [device whirring]
- [creatures shriek]

30:16.310 --> 30:17.542
Flynn!

30:20.146 --> 30:21.147
[whirring]

30:21.148 --> 30:22.914
I hate that thing.

30:27.253 --> 30:30.990
Leave him be and face your foe.

30:30.991 --> 30:32.625
Oh, with pleasure.

30:32.626 --> 30:35.695
You are a fool to meet me
unarmed, Darrington.

30:35.696 --> 30:38.331
Unarmed? Who said anything
about being unarmed?

30:38.332 --> 30:40.866
You're not the only one with one
or two tricks up his sleeve.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.103
Ha!

30:44.104 --> 30:45.571
Ahoy, ahoy.

30:45.572 --> 30:49.776
Look at me. I'm wireless.

30:49.777 --> 30:52.511
Cover your eyes.

30:59.886 --> 31:03.523
I see the weapon is chosen.

31:03.524 --> 31:06.091
A sword for a sword.

31:09.228 --> 31:11.330
Ah!

31:11.331 --> 31:15.001
A sword of pure Library energy.

31:15.002 --> 31:18.004
Ah, what's the matter, Darrington?

31:18.005 --> 31:20.073
Not quite so chipper now?

31:20.074 --> 31:22.240
Flynn, to me.

31:24.644 --> 31:26.945
I'll be right back, I promise.

31:32.218 --> 31:34.654
Ah, what method of swordsmanship

31:34.655 --> 31:35.788
shall we employ, Flynn?

31:35.789 --> 31:38.291
The Italian Dardi School?

31:38.292 --> 31:41.194
The Germanic Kunst des Fechtens?

31:41.195 --> 31:44.997
Or the Spanish La Verdadera Destreza?

31:44.998 --> 31:47.132
I prefer the Boston Bar Room Brawl.

32:13.593 --> 32:15.728
- Ha!
- After all of this time, Darrington,

32:15.729 --> 32:17.363
I finally have the upper hand.

32:17.364 --> 32:18.631
Not for the first time, Ambrose,

32:18.632 --> 32:20.666
your confidence exceeds your ability.

32:20.667 --> 32:21.833
Have at you!

32:25.404 --> 32:27.205
Darrington!

32:30.143 --> 32:33.045
- Darrington!
- And this time, my friend,

32:33.046 --> 32:36.182
you may find
my confidence is rewarded.

32:36.183 --> 32:37.950
Then let this be our final battle.

32:37.951 --> 32:39.752
- Darrington!
- Both: What?

32:39.753 --> 32:41.320
Leave the fight and
help me save my friends!

32:41.321 --> 32:42.722
No! This is too important.

32:42.723 --> 32:45.258
They're Librarians!

32:45.259 --> 32:47.026
Darrington, they're Librarians!

32:47.027 --> 32:50.863
They're expendable.
The Library will understand.

32:50.864 --> 32:52.131
This fight is for all humanity,

32:52.132 --> 32:53.633
for the future of our very world.

32:53.634 --> 32:57.637
And I have waited so very long.

32:57.638 --> 33:01.207
- As have I.
- And now it is our endgame.

33:01.208 --> 33:03.042
Then the time for
reckoning is upon us.

33:03.043 --> 33:05.611
Oh, my God, you're flirting!

33:05.612 --> 33:07.113
You don't care about good and evil!

33:07.114 --> 33:08.581
You only care
about fighting each other.

33:08.582 --> 33:10.583
Ridiculous. You're confusing
an enemy with a friend.

33:10.584 --> 33:13.152
No, you are. And if you had any
friends, you would know that.

33:13.153 --> 33:16.355
Look, I know you, I know your
life, I know your story.

33:16.356 --> 33:18.524
You're the island, the loner,
the man who knows best.

33:18.525 --> 33:20.793
You're me before I met my friends.

33:20.794 --> 33:23.462
And they save my life every day.
Now help me save them.

33:23.463 --> 33:28.067
- Oh, you two, get a room.
- I'm not abandoning my team.

33:28.068 --> 33:29.936
You've taken this too personally.

33:29.937 --> 33:33.506
No, Flynn, it is you who are
blinded by your feelings.

33:33.507 --> 33:38.109
Ambrose Gethic, thine end is nigh.

33:51.324 --> 33:52.691
No!

33:56.629 --> 33:58.431
Ahh!

33:58.432 --> 34:00.031
[grunting]

34:01.200 --> 34:03.069
No.

34:03.070 --> 34:05.571
Darrington, I don't know what to do.
He's killing them!

34:05.572 --> 34:07.006
They don't matter.

34:07.007 --> 34:09.242
Only the Library matters!

34:09.243 --> 34:13.246
Only the Library ever matters!

34:13.246 --> 34:15.980
Flynn, I need you!

34:17.516 --> 34:19.385
I'm sorry.

34:24.005 --> 34:26.806
[moaning]

34:26.808 --> 34:30.344
- [grunting]
- [device whirring]

34:30.344 --> 34:32.513
Jenkins! Jenkins!

34:32.514 --> 34:34.315
Oh! Oh, Mr. Carsen.

34:34.315 --> 34:36.884
Colonel Baird, the other
Librarians, are clones.

34:36.885 --> 34:39.420
I know. Gethic's been one step
ahead the entire time.

34:39.420 --> 34:41.222
But now I have an ace up my sleeve.

34:41.223 --> 34:42.456
Oh, good. What's that?

34:42.456 --> 34:44.659
You. Come.

34:44.659 --> 34:46.292
Yes, sir.

34:48.062 --> 34:53.266
I have waited so long for this moment,

34:53.268 --> 34:56.437
I almost don't want it to end.

34:56.438 --> 34:59.540
I finally win.

34:59.541 --> 35:02.243
Flynn was right.

35:02.244 --> 35:05.313
I've been blinded by my hate.

35:05.314 --> 35:07.113
Let's get it over with.

35:15.122 --> 35:19.393
I mean, let's reminisce for a while.

35:19.394 --> 35:24.899
Now, was it the summer
of '67... no, no, '68,

35:24.900 --> 35:26.934
when we first met?
Do... do you remember?

35:26.935 --> 35:28.803
I... I was wearing
the blue-striped suit,

35:28.804 --> 35:31.472
and, uh, you were wearing
the pith helmet.

35:31.473 --> 35:34.508
It was a white top hat.
What's your point?

35:34.509 --> 35:37.945
Well, you had that charming henchman.

35:37.946 --> 35:40.982
Now, what was his name?
Was it Igor? Or Zagor?

35:40.983 --> 35:42.383
- Derek.
- Derek.

35:42.384 --> 35:44.018
Often get those two names mixed up.

35:44.019 --> 35:45.486
Mr. Carsen, what are we doing?

35:45.487 --> 35:47.288
Gethic's been feeding off
of Librarian energy

35:47.289 --> 35:48.823
and you've got an infinite amount.

35:48.824 --> 35:50.291
- You're suggesting that...
- You're an immortal.

35:50.292 --> 35:52.460
You got a lot of juice. Fill 'er up.

35:52.461 --> 35:54.694
One overload coming up.

36:15.182 --> 36:17.284
[grunting] What is...

36:17.285 --> 36:20.620
What? No, stop!

36:23.591 --> 36:25.760
Darrington!

36:25.761 --> 36:27.795
How are you doing this?

36:27.796 --> 36:31.098
I'm not. My friends are.

36:31.099 --> 36:35.301
Friends? When have
you ever had any Fri...

36:44.078 --> 36:46.213
- Yes. Yes.
- You okay?

36:46.214 --> 36:48.748
Uh-huh, yes.

36:59.760 --> 37:03.931
Flynn, you saved me.

37:03.932 --> 37:06.534
You defeated Gethic.

37:06.535 --> 37:10.270
Because I saved my friends.

37:17.511 --> 37:19.914
There you go. There you go.

37:19.915 --> 37:21.182
That's good!

37:21.183 --> 37:23.449
Petey: All right, Mom!

37:26.554 --> 37:28.756
Mom: Oh! Petey.

37:28.757 --> 37:32.593
Ambrose Gethic is dead.

37:32.594 --> 37:34.128
Do you know, it's strange,

37:34.129 --> 37:37.364
but I feel like I've lost
my reason for being.

37:37.365 --> 37:39.766
What will I do
with the rest of my life?

37:42.369 --> 37:44.738
I can't answer that.

37:44.739 --> 37:47.675
You said I was your hero, Flynn.

37:47.676 --> 37:49.910
Why choose me?

37:49.911 --> 37:55.749
When I became the Librarian,
I was, uh, alone,

37:55.750 --> 37:56.917
and I needed a friend.

37:56.918 --> 37:59.186
So I found one in the pages of a book.

37:59.187 --> 38:00.588
This book.

38:00.589 --> 38:03.691
And I read everything
that I could about you.

38:03.692 --> 38:05.860
I read about your adventures

38:05.861 --> 38:07.795
and your victories and your genius.

38:07.796 --> 38:11.165
I read about you until I knew you
as well as I would know any friend.

38:11.166 --> 38:14.234
And you were always there for me.

38:16.871 --> 38:18.205
But then I met everyone else here,

38:18.206 --> 38:20.174
and I have to tell you, Darrington,

38:20.175 --> 38:23.777
you are brilliant,
and you are my hero,

38:23.778 --> 38:25.778
but you need some friends.

38:27.181 --> 38:30.850
Well, I hope I may count you
among them, Flynn Carsen.

38:33.387 --> 38:35.955
Always and forever, Darrington Dare.

38:37.858 --> 38:39.727
My friend.

38:39.728 --> 38:41.262
Cassandra: What happened
to fake old us?

38:41.263 --> 38:43.864
Ah, well, once their
creator was defeated,

38:43.865 --> 38:47.368
they returned to dust
and... gooey bits.

38:47.369 --> 38:50.538
Mr. Dare, I have managed
to reverse engineer

38:50.539 --> 38:53.040
the portal accelerator
that Gethic designed.

38:53.041 --> 38:54.942
It should be good for a one-time,

38:54.943 --> 38:57.778
one-way trip back to 1888.

38:57.779 --> 39:00.181
Thank you, Galahad.

39:00.182 --> 39:04.884
My honor and pleasure to
serve you one last time, sir.

39:11.058 --> 39:12.893
We will not meet again,

39:12.894 --> 39:14.261
but it feels good to live my life

39:14.262 --> 39:16.530
knowing that some day
you'll read about it.

39:16.531 --> 39:18.666
Darrington. Darrington.

39:18.667 --> 39:22.403
Um, tomorrow when you go back,

39:22.404 --> 39:25.204
uh, on your birthday...

39:27.775 --> 39:29.944
have a really great day.

39:29.945 --> 39:31.045
Have a great birthday.

39:31.046 --> 39:33.813
I will. Thank you.

39:35.683 --> 39:37.985
Ahoy, ahoy.

39:37.986 --> 39:40.820
Ahoy, ahoy.

39:43.958 --> 39:46.159
Ahoy, ahoy!

39:49.163 --> 39:54.501
Well, that's that.
Tomorrow... he died.

39:54.502 --> 39:57.171
No. Wait, Flynn!

39:57.172 --> 39:59.607
Come and look at this.

39:59.608 --> 40:02.176
Look, it... it's changed.
He doesn't die tomorrow.

40:02.177 --> 40:04.778
Something in his outlook shifted

40:04.779 --> 40:06.747
and he reconnected with his friends.

40:06.748 --> 40:08.616
They spent his birthday with him,

40:08.617 --> 40:09.750
and when he was attacked,

40:09.751 --> 40:11.285
they stood by him and defended him.

40:11.286 --> 40:13.621
He lived to fight another day.

40:13.622 --> 40:15.356
Plenty more days. Look!

40:15.357 --> 40:17.291
He lived another 62 years.

40:17.292 --> 40:21.061
It says after he retired,
he died at the age of 102.

40:21.062 --> 40:24.731
Ha! Darrington Dare.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.168
It says here his final words were,

40:28.169 --> 40:30.904
"I have no regrets.

40:30.905 --> 40:33.239
I look forward only to
the adventures yet to come."

40:35.409 --> 40:37.944
Sounds like a win-win, buddy.

40:59.266 --> 41:01.735
Darrington: <i>"Dear Flynn,
by the time you read this,</i>

41:01.736 --> 41:04.672
<i>I will have been dead
for a very long time.</i>

41:04.673 --> 41:06.006
<i>But in all my years,</i>

41:06.007 --> 41:08.008
<i>I never stopped thinking about you.</i>

41:08.009 --> 41:10.811
<i>You were right about so many things,</i>

41:10.812 --> 41:13.347
<i>but I am right about this thing.</i>

41:13.348 --> 41:17.551
<i>There should only ever be
one Librarian in the Library.</i>

41:17.552 --> 41:21.488
<i>My dying wish, Flynn,
is that you put this right</i>

41:21.489 --> 41:23.489
<i>"before it's too late."</i>
