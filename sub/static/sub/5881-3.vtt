WEBVTT

00:47.005 --> 00:49.090
Hey. Dick?

00:51.260 --> 00:52.510
Richard Whitman?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.847
Holy smokes, is that you?

00:56.974 --> 00:58.933
As I live and breathe.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.017
It's me. Larry.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.938
Krisinski, L. Fort Sill?

01:04.022 --> 01:07.775
Oh , of course. Larry, look at you .

01:07.860 --> 01:09.569
Yeah, and you .

01:09.653 --> 01:11.446
Still haven't filled out,
You must be a bachelor.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.948
No.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.992
Where are you at?
I'm out of Waltham , Mass.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.954
I'm just spending a day in Armonk
with International Business Machines.

01:20.038 --> 01:20.955
I'm upstate.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.957
Hey, I just saw Jerry Creighton .

01:23.041 --> 01:24.959
Remember? Slept with a sidearm in his bunk.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.836
Almost blew his jaw off?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.464
Yeah , I remember that.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.966
Yeah , well-- Look, I should , uh--

01:32.050 --> 01:34.051
Call me. We should catch up.

01:35.554 --> 01:36.679
Absolutely.

01:36.764 --> 01:37.972
Old Dick Whitman .

01:38.056 --> 01:40.433
What are the chances?

02:07.085 --> 02:09.545
Good morning, Hollis.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.964
I mean , it's France,
What do they want with the bomb?

02:12.049 --> 02:13.216
We must have given it to them .

02:13.300 --> 02:15.259
No way the frogs
came up with it on their own .

02:15.344 --> 02:17.011
- Hey, it's the honeymoon kid ,
- Hey.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.680
Here comes Romeo
without his roe, like a dried herring .

02:19.765 --> 02:20.932
Do I seem different?

02:21.016 --> 02:22.558
You do look depleted, Humps.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.559
The wedding was great.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.019
How was the rest of it?

02:25.103 --> 02:26.562
You're talking about my wife here.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.606
Oh, she's already got you there?

02:28.690 --> 02:29.816
Gentlemen never discuss this.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.526
We're talking about you here:

02:31.610 --> 02:34.111
the man who told us
the coat check girl from "2 1 "

02:34.196 --> 02:36.656
had tangerine panties.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.825
Come on, buddy boy, spill.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.952
I don't know.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.162
Something happened in the ceremony.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.999
It's when he said that thing
about being new baptized .

02:47.084 --> 02:49.627
I just felt this calm come over me.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.338
So what you're saying is,
uh, a lot of missionary?

02:58.095 --> 02:59.929
Fine.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.473
So she's laying there, right?

03:02.558 --> 03:04.058
And she kept looking at the maps,

03:04.142 --> 03:07.603
talking about all the things
we were going to do. . .

03:07.688 --> 03:09.272
but we never did .

03:09.356 --> 03:11.274
Ladies Home Journal .
I can get that at Mom's.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.692
Welcome back, Mr. Campbell.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.735
Well, hey, there.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.029
The ring , it's like catnip.

03:17.155 --> 03:21.158
Did you know that 600,000 gallons of water
go over the Falls per second?

03:21.243 --> 03:22.243
Per second!

03:22.327 --> 03:24.078
Oh , look. He's back.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.496
Good morning .

03:25.581 --> 03:28.082
- Congratulations.
- Welcome back.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.792
Thanks, everybody.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.168
When did this place get so friendly?

03:31.253 --> 03:32.420
I guess people missed you .

03:32.504 --> 03:34.338
- Welcome back, M r. Campbell.
- Hildy.

03:39.136 --> 03:42.179
Close the door!

03:43.765 --> 03:46.475
Who put the Chinamen in my office?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.061
Welcome back.

03:56.194 --> 04:00.156
They paid an Oriental family
to be in M r. Campbell's office.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.199
Someone will finally
be working in there.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.753
Mr. Romano, Mr, Kinsey, and Mr. Crane
are here for your meeting .

04:16.214 --> 04:17.673
Do you need a minute?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.175
Doyou need a minute? You must.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.969
You keep moving the Secor laxative
discussion .

04:25.223 --> 04:27.224
See what we did to Campbell's office?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.144
What do we have?

04:31.229 --> 04:34.148
Let me remind you, safe and reliable
would make me doze off

04:34.232 --> 04:37.693
if I wasn't so blighted
by the scourge of constipation .

04:37.778 --> 04:40.571
Well , what can I say? I'm blocked .

04:40.656 --> 04:43.157
I told you he wouldn't
think that was funny.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.367
I got one.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.244
How 'bout "Secor. It's satisfeculant"?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.163
Stay in the art department, Sal .

04:49.247 --> 04:53.167
I'm just saying we can be funny,
like those Volkswagen people.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.543
You see this yet?

04:54.628 --> 04:55.753
I have.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.797
I don't know what I hate about it the most,

04:57.881 --> 04:59.090
the ad or the car.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.424
You know, they did one last year.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.176
Same kind of smirk.
Remember "Think small"?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.345
It was a half-page ad in a full-page buy.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.805
You could barely see the product.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.014
I don't get it.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.557
Elvis just got back from West Germany.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.434
Why not put him in it?

05:10.519 --> 05:11.894
They must be getting results.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.313
They keep going back to the well .

05:14.398 --> 05:16.524
I want the Chinamen
out of the building by lunch .

05:16.608 --> 05:18.192
I'm still waiting on my shirts.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.070
You've seen this?

05:34.710 --> 05:37.294
- I'm back now.
- I see that.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.673
So. . .

05:40.757 --> 05:42.883
I should be on the list for the meeting .

05:42.968 --> 05:44.760
Oh, I just--

05:44.845 --> 05:46.554
I didn't know when
you were coming back.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.805
Right.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.934
Yeah , well, it's today. Here I am .

05:53.311 --> 05:55.688
They're all in there already. You can go in .

06:00.277 --> 06:01.318
Peggy. . .

06:05.782 --> 06:07.575
When I came over that night,

06:07.659 --> 06:09.994
you know, before.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.287
I was there.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.665
You know. . .

06:14.750 --> 06:16.333
I'm married now.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.502
I know.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.129
So. . .

06:24.301 --> 06:27.053
Pete. . .

06:27.137 --> 06:29.263
I understand .

06:29.347 --> 06:30.556
It never happened .

06:33.060 --> 06:34.894
You want me to buzz you in?

06:34.978 --> 06:37.521
The door looks a little bit open .

06:44.362 --> 06:46.614
Sorry about that.
I took the Chinese out of the building.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.282
But I have a feeling in an hour

06:48.366 --> 06:50.034
I'm gonna want
to take them out again .

06:53.830 --> 06:55.956
Bernbach . He's a Jew.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.293
If I were him , I wouldn't want
to help reindustrialize Germany.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.836
Everybody's got a price.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.296
Oh , yeah , I saw that.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.964
Honesty. It's a great angle.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.967
No chrome, no horsepower,

07:07.052 --> 07:09.220
foreign , ugly.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.387
Guess they went with their strengths.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.681
- It is funny.
- It is?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.058
'Cause I think the joke's on us.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.228
You're supposed to look at that
and say it's a great car, not a great ad .

07:17.312 --> 07:18.646
I laughed . I think it's brilliant.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.189
Brilliant.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.442
I'll tell you what brilliance
in advertising is: 99 cents.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.777
Somebody thought of that, Campbell .

07:24.861 --> 07:27.279
Well, say what you want. Love it or hate it,

07:27.364 --> 07:30.574
the fact remains we've been talking
about this for the last 1 5 minutes.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.370
And this is Playboy.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.083
Of course, what we should have
been talking about is Secor laxative,

07:39.167 --> 07:42.378
unless, as it appears,
there is nothing to say.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.880
I don't want to hear this.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.340
We're on the case.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.677
Part of this job is doing things
you don't want to do.

07:49.761 --> 07:50.970
Most of it.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.144
It's good to be back, Draper.
I missed you .

07:58.228 --> 08:00.437
Then it must not have been
much of a honeymoon .

08:03.275 --> 08:05.901
I'm sorry. Welcome back.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.154
How's married life?

08:08.238 --> 08:09.655
It's pretty swell .

08:12.450 --> 08:15.411
I was raised that men don't wear jewelry.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.372
I kind of like it.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.207
Trudy's a lot funnier than I thought.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.501
I'm actually looking forward
to going home tonight.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.712
Well, I look forward to meeting her.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.882
Hey, maybe one of these nights

08:27.966 --> 08:30.718
we could get dinner together
with the, uh , wives.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.011
Maybe we can .

08:49.821 --> 08:51.739
You know, girls, we'd be happy
to bring you coffee.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.407
I was on my way over anyways.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.618
I have something of yours.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.413
Lady Chatterley's Lover.
I finished it last night.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.790
Good to the last drop, right?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.959
Well , I can see why it got banned .

09:04.044 --> 09:05.961
Well , you don't have to be so shy about it.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.421
It's literature.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.797
That is a huge pocketbook, Joan .

09:08.882 --> 09:12.176
Well, it's got a change of clothing
and a toothbrush in it.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.636
A hope chest.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.638
Have you read this, Peggy?

09:15.722 --> 09:18.849
I don't think that's a good idea.

09:18.934 --> 09:23.729
There's, um . . .this word in it a lot.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.147
I know the word, Joan.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.565
Well, it's sad , really,

09:26.650 --> 09:29.151
because even with its reputation ,
men won't read it.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.444
And they really should .

09:30.528 --> 09:32.196
I don't care if it's 500 years old .

09:32.280 --> 09:35.199
It's another testimony to how
most people think marriage is a joke.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.951
They rip a lot of clothing .

09:37.035 --> 09:38.452
Yeah , it's a fantasy.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.663
He's married , and she's married .

09:40.747 --> 09:43.123
The desperate passion
of the forbidden .

09:43.208 --> 09:44.667
Can I borrow it?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.835
She's making it sound better than it is.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.504
There's a few good parts, that's all.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.965
And the book just opens
to those pages by itself.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.760
Hey, don't read it on the train .

09:54.844 --> 09:56.428
It'll attract the wrong element.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.597
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.896
So the doctor says to him ,
"I hope you're happy.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.481
"While you were out
finishing a round of golf,

10:07.565 --> 10:09.441
"your wife was in a horrible accident.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.360
"She is gonna need 'round-the-clock care.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.279
Bathing, toilet."

10:13.363 --> 10:15.072
Then the doc looks at him and says,

10:15.156 --> 10:16.240
"I'm just kidding . She's dead .

10:16.324 --> 10:17.491
Hey, what'd you shoot?"

10:17.575 --> 10:19.368
. . .initial research report

10:19.452 --> 10:22.413
and what I think are some very astute
market observations.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.542
Mr. Draper.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.503
Pleased to see you didn't disappear
the minute you cashed my check.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.672
We appreciate your business.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.299
Kenny, of course, you know.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.509
Harry Crane, media.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.512
And Mr, George Pelham over here,
who is from research ,

10:38.596 --> 10:40.556
and who has more degrees
than a Russian protractor.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.474
That's quite an introduction .

10:42.559 --> 10:44.518
From the other side of the pond , I see.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.395
We take his word for it.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.151
So, uh , that is yours to keep.

10:52.235 --> 10:56.530
But if you'd like to follow along,
you'll see from the overview

10:56.614 --> 11:00.909
our primary focus was Saks,
Henri Bendel, and Bonwit Teller.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.746
Our research uncovered
a variety of options

11:03.830 --> 11:07.416
they utilize to attract
your desired customers.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.670
One thing these stores have in common
is a comfortable shopping environment.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.173
Spacious, open sales floors,

11:14.257 --> 11:17.009
An almost conspicuous lack of clutter.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.552
Merchandise is minimal

11:18.636 --> 11:22.973
and neatly presented on tables
and in display cases.

11:23.058 --> 11:28.187
This "less is more" philosophy
is also evident in the window displays.

11:28.271 --> 11:32.191
For example,
only one sweater to a window,

11:32.275 --> 11:35.569
as opposed to windows
stuffed with merchandise.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.571
My father's going to love that.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.032
Believe it or not,
it even applies to the mannequins.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.825
Bendel's takes the heads off theirs

11:41.910 --> 11:44.286
so the shopper can imagine them
to be anyone.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.788
Anyone without a head .

11:45.872 --> 11:47.748
Along with these cosmetic changes,

11:47.832 --> 11:52.586
you'll also need to provide
what we call boutique extras.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.712
A personal shopping service,

11:53.797 --> 11:55.339
private fashion shows,

11:55.423 --> 11:56.757
and designer collections.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.592
This is comprehensive.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.552
It's the lay of the land .

12:00.678 --> 12:04.348
Just from holding it, I feel more informed
about my competitors than ever.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.603
And yet my store already has
a personal shopping service

12:09.687 --> 12:12.106
and designer collections,

12:12.232 --> 12:14.608
which makes me wonder
if you were so focused on my competitors

12:14.692 --> 12:16.777
that you failed to visit my store.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.489
I've been away on my honeymoon .

12:20.573 --> 12:21.865
I've been there a few times.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.993
It's a beautiful old place.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.375
Miss Menken, I can assure you

12:31.459 --> 12:35.754
that no one at this table
has ever been to your store.

12:35.839 --> 12:39.091
A wrong I will personally correct
this afternoon .

12:42.178 --> 12:44.596
It's right on 5th Avenue.

12:44.681 --> 12:48.642
That's one big block over
and a dozen little blocks up.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.895
It's been there for 30 years.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.730
- I'll walk you out.
- I've got it.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.654
Harry.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.947
What?

13:03.575 --> 13:06.118
It was nice
the way you handled that.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.162
It's hard to get caught in a lie.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.663
Well , it wasn't a lie.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.124
It was ineptitude
with insufficient cover.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.837
Something about the way
you talk always restores my confidence.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.672
I have a deep voice.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.632
This afternoon, then .

13:20.717 --> 13:22.551
It's a date.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.389
New junior exec.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.691
Changing her store
could take six months--

13:37.775 --> 13:40.152
or a year, if I know what's good for me.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.029
- What was that in there?
- What?

13:42.113 --> 13:44.406
Don and Molly Goldberg ,
Did you see that?

13:44.491 --> 13:45.908
Yeah , I caught it. What's your point?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.868
I don't know. I mean,
everybody always jokes about it,

13:47.952 --> 13:50.329
but I've never seen Draper
really turn that switch on before.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.789
I guess he likes her. What would you do?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.545
Trying to quit.

13:58.630 --> 14:02.716
You are really putting the junior
in junior executive.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.968
Look, you're married now, all right?

14:05.053 --> 14:08.430
I'm a part of that club, too.
Two very happy years.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.891
But when I'm out in the world--

14:10.975 --> 14:12.851
I don't know. I don't do it much .

14:12.936 --> 14:14.144
I'm not good at it--

14:14.229 --> 14:15.979
The flirting , the double entendres--

14:16.064 --> 14:17.731
You mean something on the side?

14:17.815 --> 14:22.236
No, I mean enjoying
the company of women

14:22.320 --> 14:24.279
in the limited way a married man can .

14:25.698 --> 14:27.533
It's all we have, really.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.743
I can't speak for everyone,
but it's plenty for me.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.828
Same. I guess on some level,

14:31.913 --> 14:33.747
I always thought Draper
was the same way.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.415
Draper?

14:35.500 --> 14:36.750
Who knows anything about that guy.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.335
No one's ever lifted that rock.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.129
He could be Batman for all we know.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.466
M r. Campbell,
you wife's on the phone.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.510
There's bird shit on the couch .

14:46.594 --> 14:47.886
That was priceless.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.889
Hello, honey.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.849
Dinner? Wow.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.310
What do I want for dinner?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.187
I don't know.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.773
Anything but chicken .

14:59.857 --> 15:01.066
Yes, they missed me.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.778
U h , rib eye in the pan with butter.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.780
Ice cream .

15:06.864 --> 15:08.448
I love you , too.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.413
There's going to be dinner
waiting for me when I get home.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.373
Yeah . How about that?

15:42.900 --> 15:46.945
M r. Kurland was mitigating a skirmish
in our housewares section .

15:47.030 --> 15:48.864
Why do I hire young girls?

15:48.948 --> 15:51.533
Because they cost practically nothing .

15:51.618 --> 15:53.452
Costume change.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.953
This is my closet.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.835
The original tenants laid the last brick
the day before the crash .

16:01.919 --> 16:03.920
Boy, were they in for a surprise.

16:05.757 --> 16:10.135
As I hope you know by now,
our original store was just off 7th Avenue.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.845
It was just hosiery.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.056
Then they started pulling piecework
from sweatshops.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.517
By 1 932, these people had failed .

16:17.602 --> 16:20.854
My father and uncle
picked this place up for a shekel .

16:20.938 --> 16:23.440
Well, it is crowded .

16:23.524 --> 16:25.859
But that might have
something to do with the sale,

16:25.943 --> 16:28.236
which means that, if we're successful,

16:28.321 --> 16:29.863
you're gonna lose
the customers you have

16:29.947 --> 16:31.865
in order to get
the customers you want.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.825
I was gonna start with raising prices.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.786
Can you imagine what my father said?

16:35.870 --> 16:37.621
Well, you do have
to give them something

16:37.705 --> 16:38.955
for their higher dollar count.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.043
It's just awfully hard to define what that is.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.883
How may I help you?

16:49.967 --> 16:52.803
I make them say that.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.263
Carol , can we see this tray right here?

17:03.648 --> 17:05.315
Sea horses,

17:05.400 --> 17:06.608
crowns,

17:06.693 --> 17:07.984
lucky dice.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.113
Medieval knights.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.834
That's better.

17:23.918 --> 17:25.001
Thank you .

17:31.801 --> 17:34.010
Let's take a look at the second floor.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.147
We're known for our service.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.940
That's gotta be a tough job.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.025
I know.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.945
I've always liked how quiet it is up here.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.948
Well, that might explain the lack of customers.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.786
I can see the charm , but. . .

17:59.871 --> 18:02.831
the room is too dark, too old-fashioned .

18:02.915 --> 18:04.124
The products look old .

18:04.208 --> 18:05.584
But the people look wonderful .

18:07.420 --> 18:09.963
It's a shame we're gonna
have to lop their heads off.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.340
It'll ruin your favorite part of the store.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.634
It's not my favorite part, actually.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.360
The grand lot of us are going to Lansky's.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.029
Can you believe it?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.656
Have a swell time. I've got plans.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.620
You look nice.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.510
Hell .

18:56.594 --> 18:59.304
Manhattan at your feet,
I can see the appeal.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.014
The view's okay.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.810
No, this is my favorite part of the store.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.687
Hey there, Missy.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.816
Hey.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.818
I haven't seen you in a while.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.403
- Hey.
- How did they get the penthouse?

19:15.488 --> 19:17.072
They patrol .

19:17.156 --> 19:18.907
It's the only way to make sure

19:18.991 --> 19:20.909
there isn't anyone hiding
in the store at night.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.619
Well, they know I'm with you , right?

19:22.703 --> 19:25.914
These two are Carla and Leona.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.334
Not the originals, but third generation,

19:29.418 --> 19:31.962
and what every generation
of Menken dog

19:32.046 --> 19:36.049
shall be named until the end of time.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.051
I made my father's
legal counsel add that

19:38.135 --> 19:40.053
to the store's by-laws when I was 9.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.639
So even then you enjoyed
telling men what to do.

19:42.723 --> 19:46.101
To be fair, the store
was practically home.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.478
My father liked to work.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.981
I used to come out here
and talk to them--

19:51.065 --> 19:52.065
well, the originals--

19:52.149 --> 19:54.067
every night.

19:54.151 --> 19:58.029
For a little girl,
a dog can be all you need .

19:58.114 --> 20:01.074
They protect you . They listen .

20:01.158 --> 20:03.577
I had my sister, but there weren't other kids.

20:03.661 --> 20:07.080
And, of course,
my mother wasn't around .

20:07.164 --> 20:09.958
Well , that's not always a bad thing .

20:10.042 --> 20:12.085
Who knows?

20:12.169 --> 20:14.170
She died when she was having me.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.551
Anyway, my sister
became my only company.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.094
And frankly,

20:21.178 --> 20:23.179
these bitches were easier to handle.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.186
What is this?

20:33.733 --> 20:36.651
Don't try to convince me
that you were ever unloved .

21:07.892 --> 21:09.476
I don't know what to say.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.779
Listen . . .

21:25.660 --> 21:27.702
I'm married .

21:34.251 --> 21:37.379
I guess I didn't ask
'cause I didn't want to know.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.549
That shouldn't have happened .

21:43.302 --> 21:45.929
Well, you couldn't help yourself.

21:46.013 --> 21:49.182
I knew what I wanted . . .

21:49.266 --> 21:51.184
from the first time
you stormed out of our office.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.269
You stormed out of your office.

21:55.106 --> 21:58.108
I took you up here. That was stupid .

21:59.819 --> 22:01.861
I just so looked forward
to seeing you again .

22:03.906 --> 22:05.657
Now I guess that's over.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.087
I know you understand

22:19.171 --> 22:22.298
I'd rather not have to
explain this to anyone.

22:22.383 --> 22:23.425
The account stays.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.510
I just want someone else on it.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.348
Don't look at me like that.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.643
What do you do,
just kiss women all the time?

22:33.728 --> 22:34.853
Women you aren't married to?

22:34.937 --> 22:36.896
Of course not.

22:36.981 --> 22:40.316
Well, then, am I supposed to live
some life running alongside yours?

22:48.325 --> 22:51.327
I have some checks to sign.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.957
Excuse me.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.751
You dropped your paper.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.380
Thank you .

24:20.417 --> 24:21.376
Daddy!

24:21.460 --> 24:23.169
Daddy! Daddy!

24:23.254 --> 24:25.255
Wake up. It's my birthday.

24:25.339 --> 24:28.258
It's my birthday!

24:28.342 --> 24:31.052
It's not your birthday. It's your party.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.345
Don, the party's at 2:00.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.932
You have to put together
the P-L-A-Y-H-O-U-S-E.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.269
How am I going to put together a pony?

24:39.353 --> 24:42.313
A pony? I'm getting a pony?

24:42.398 --> 24:44.440
Bobby, I'm getting a pony!

24:46.026 --> 24:47.652
Great.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.364
She'll forget all about it
when she sees the playhouse.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.454
There's a bacon and egg sandwich
for you on the range.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.547
It's got a red door like ours!

25:49.632 --> 25:51.341
Daddy!

25:51.425 --> 25:53.760
You are not supposed to see this yet.

25:54.929 --> 25:57.472
Why don't you run to the garage
and get me another beer?

25:57.556 --> 25:58.681
Okay.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.689
Capers?

26:06.774 --> 26:08.483
You want to pick those out of the rug?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.443
Well, they look naked .

26:10.527 --> 26:14.447
Well, the only thing
this one wants is raw hamburger.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.866
What does that mean?

26:16.951 --> 26:18.451
I think that's enough of that.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.744
Well , how many are we?

26:19.828 --> 26:21.454
Us, you--

26:21.538 --> 26:23.081
Carlton's with the kids. Make it quick.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.333
The Darlings, Helen Bishop--

26:25.417 --> 26:27.627
- You didn't.
- I had to.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.462
She saw me buying balloons at the market.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.047
- Didn't seem right.
- So what?

26:31.131 --> 26:34.133
I just brought her the pie,
got my dish back at the end .

26:34.218 --> 26:36.511
Have you seen her walking
up Downtree Ridge?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.846
Where the hell is she walking to?

26:39.932 --> 26:42.183
I don't know.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.476
How old is her kid?

26:43.560 --> 26:45.603
Kids.

26:45.688 --> 26:46.896
The boy is 9.

26:46.981 --> 26:48.898
I'm gonna say Gary, maybe Glen?

26:48.983 --> 26:50.483
And the baby is a 2-year-old .

26:50.567 --> 26:52.527
She said she was gonna
try and get a sitter.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.654
I would .

26:54.738 --> 26:56.781
It's probably a big event for her.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.498
That man .

27:07.459 --> 27:08.626
I know.

28:02.056 --> 28:05.224
You didn't use the powder room , did you?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.185
It will appear untouched .

28:08.520 --> 28:09.562
Everyone's gonna be here soon .

28:09.646 --> 28:11.564
Why don't you go up
and take a shower?

28:11.648 --> 28:13.316
Want company?

28:57.277 --> 28:59.737
Mint juleps. It's that time of year.

28:59.822 --> 29:02.698
- Wonderful.
- I'm so thirsty lately.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.412
Ready or not, here I come!

29:07.496 --> 29:09.956
There's date nut bread,
cold turkey,

29:10.040 --> 29:12.166
and Waldorf salad for the adults.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.256
And I just made
peanut butter sandwiches for the kids.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.049
I know everybody eats that.

29:20.134 --> 29:21.759
Thank you .

29:21.844 --> 29:23.761
And in case anybody's going to ask,

29:23.846 --> 29:25.346
I did not get that clown .

29:25.431 --> 29:26.681
- Oh .
- Oh .

29:26.765 --> 29:28.724
He got booked in some off-Broadway show.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.810
About clowns? I think we saw that.

29:30.894 --> 29:34.147
It's not the one
where they take their clothes off, is it?

29:34.231 --> 29:35.273
Who knew that could be boring?

29:37.317 --> 29:39.444
Want something a little
stronger there, Carlton?

29:39.528 --> 29:40.653
He'll manage.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.155
We were thinking about you , Don .

29:43.740 --> 29:45.241
We saw this thing on TV.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.660
It was right in the middle
of the news. It was cute.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.911
The guy flying with his hat on.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.247
- Did you do that one?
- It was so cute.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.584
- I think the man looks exactly like Henry.
- Except not as handsome.

29:55.669 --> 29:57.170
I haven't seen that.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.672
I'm going to go and lay
the kids' food out.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.924
Let's not even bother
trying to get them to sit.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.301
I'll co-pilot.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.927
Heard a good one the other day.

30:05.012 --> 30:05.928
No, Chet.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.430
I'm gonna tell the joke.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.682
Your wife and your lawyer
are drowning .

30:09.766 --> 30:11.225
You have a choice to make:

30:11.310 --> 30:13.686
you go to lunch or a movie?

30:13.770 --> 30:15.188
It's good, right?

30:15.272 --> 30:16.689
Hey, I'm missing the ball game.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.316
I might as well have some fun .

30:18.400 --> 30:19.859
Hey.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.944
So how are things on Mad Ave, Don?

30:22.029 --> 30:24.238
Looks like they're taking care of you .

30:24.323 --> 30:26.949
We got it all, huh?

30:27.034 --> 30:28.826
Yep, this is it.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.875
Maybe it's his obsession with sports,
but it's been hard for Jack.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.920
Marilyn, I've been watching Kevin,
and he gets around very well.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.299
I bet he doesn't know the difference.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.717
He does.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.719
He's very determined .

30:46.803 --> 30:49.764
Jack really gets angry anytime someone
mentions the vaccine,

30:49.848 --> 30:51.807
and I tell him we should be grateful .

30:51.892 --> 30:54.018
First of all, it could
have been much worse.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.728
It could have gotten to his lungs.

30:55.812 --> 30:58.523
Second of all, this can't happen
to other children .

30:58.607 --> 31:00.399
They think they're athletes.

31:00.484 --> 31:01.776
I want to say to Chet,

31:01.860 --> 31:04.111
"I saw you play football in high school.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.323
Your son's going to be
a tackling dummy just like you ."

31:17.918 --> 31:19.043
According to Glen here,

31:19.127 --> 31:22.421
when the door's a little bit open,
you're supposed to come in .

31:22.506 --> 31:24.423
Hello, Helen .

31:26.093 --> 31:30.221
I hate to start with a bunch of excuses,
but the babysitter was late,

31:30.305 --> 31:32.139
and I still haven't
unpacked all the boxes,

31:32.224 --> 31:34.559
so this was the only paper I could find .

31:36.103 --> 31:39.855
It should be Christmas all year
as far as I'm concerned .

31:43.860 --> 31:46.404
A jury in New York City

31:46.488 --> 31:47.863
is expected to receive
the tax evasion paper--

31:49.324 --> 31:53.327
. . .Opera's production
of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro,

31:53.412 --> 31:56.747
with Robert Merrill and Joan Sutherland .

31:56.832 --> 31:59.125
Don, you have to pick up the cake
from H ightop.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.712
Oh , and this is Helen Bishop and Glen .

32:02.796 --> 32:03.879
Nice to meet you all .

32:05.674 --> 32:07.592
Don . He goes with me.

32:07.676 --> 32:10.678
Then Carlton, Chet, and Jack.

32:10.762 --> 32:11.804
Glen , I'm pretty sure there are

32:11.888 --> 32:13.222
some peanut butter
sandwiches and a BB gun

32:13.307 --> 32:14.265
out there in the backyard .

32:14.349 --> 32:15.891
Why don't you come with me?

32:21.982 --> 32:23.774
Don, can I speak with you?

32:23.859 --> 32:26.819
Let's see, I told you about the cake,

32:26.903 --> 32:29.822
and-- oh, can you take
some movies this time?

32:29.906 --> 32:32.617
Of everyone or just Chief Tiny Tim?

32:32.701 --> 32:35.828
You bought that camera,
and you always forget.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.371
Okay.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.838
Ladies, ladies, this is Helen Bishop.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.840
- This is Marilyn .
- Nice to meet you .

32:47.924 --> 32:48.841
And Nancy.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.093
She seems scared , poor thing .

32:51.178 --> 32:55.181
Trust me, those hens are
gonna peck her to death .

32:55.265 --> 32:57.933
Do you see her running around
in that little Volkswagen?

32:58.018 --> 32:59.435
That's kind of desperate.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.646
That won't help her.
It's got no back seat.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.439
She'll have to find some midget hitchhiker.

33:05.275 --> 33:08.986
Last time I saw one of those,
I think I was throwing a grenade into it.

33:09.071 --> 33:09.987
Yeah .

33:10.072 --> 33:12.740
The problem with Easter break
is it's too long .

33:12.824 --> 33:13.908
The doldrums.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.869
We're thinking about seven days,
six nights, in Boca Raton,

33:16.953 --> 33:19.080
with mosquitoes as big as a silver dollar.

33:19.164 --> 33:22.541
And believe me, those aren't the only
giant noses you'll have to deal with .

33:22.626 --> 33:24.377
Francine.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.295
Carlton and I went
there on our honeymoon,

33:26.380 --> 33:28.506
and all I can say
is we were outnumbered .

33:28.590 --> 33:29.507
It's uncomfortable.

33:29.591 --> 33:30.925
You want to be able to relax.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.010
We went to Bermuda
on our honeymoon.

33:33.095 --> 33:34.220
Pink sand beaches.

33:35.305 --> 33:36.472
Where did you go?

33:37.724 --> 33:40.393
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

33:42.145 --> 33:44.980
It's okay. I went to Paris.

33:45.065 --> 33:47.900
Four years of Mount Holyoke French .

33:47.984 --> 33:49.568
Haven't used it since.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.908
And I wouldn't give it back,
even being with Glen's father.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.993
Is that your ex-husband?

33:58.995 --> 34:00.705
Yes.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.916
I went to Italy.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.209
Not on my honeymoon ,

34:05.293 --> 34:08.003
but right after I graduated from Bryn Mawr.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.380
What a summer.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.673
Three Coins in the Fountain .

34:10.757 --> 34:11.966
It was right about that time.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.926
You must have loved Paris.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.386
It's all walking .

34:15.470 --> 34:17.054
What do you mean?

34:17.139 --> 34:20.307
Just that I've seen you
walking around the neighborhood .

34:20.392 --> 34:23.978
I've seen you , too, when I was driving .
I think I waved .

34:24.062 --> 34:25.938
Where are you going
when you do that?

34:26.022 --> 34:29.024
No place. I just like to walk.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.738
But where?

34:33.822 --> 34:35.656
Anywhere.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.325
It just relaxes me and clears my mind .

34:38.410 --> 34:40.619
I heard on the radio that Einstein did it.

34:40.704 --> 34:43.205
Einstein? He's got
his hands into everything .

34:56.928 --> 34:57.970
Sweetie.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.096
H i, Daddy!

35:13.236 --> 35:14.904
What are you , Frank Sinatra?

35:14.988 --> 35:16.781
I was looking for Glen .

35:16.865 --> 35:19.784
Bunch of them just ran through .

35:23.121 --> 35:25.080
There are the boys.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.082
How are we doing?

35:31.671 --> 35:33.422
It's, uh , it's Helen, right?

35:35.801 --> 35:38.010
I know your situation ,

35:38.094 --> 35:40.262
and my heart breaks for that little boy.

35:40.347 --> 35:42.097
I have a baby, too.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.308
You can act strong ,

35:44.392 --> 35:46.519
but I just want to volunteer.

35:46.603 --> 35:47.770
If you ever need someone

35:47.854 --> 35:49.980
to throw the ball
around with him some Sunday,

35:50.065 --> 35:51.941
take him to the beach .

35:52.025 --> 35:54.109
That would be nice.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.614
I'm sure eventually I'd get so used
to your Sunday visits,

35:58.698 --> 36:01.700
I'd join you at the beach,
just the four of us.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.787
Then one night, you'd
drop us off at the house

36:04.871 --> 36:07.540
and walk me in with an umbrella.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.041
The kids would go to sleep,

36:09.125 --> 36:11.001
and we'd laugh
about all the funny things

36:11.086 --> 36:12.753
that happened at the beach that day.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.047
I don't want you telling Francine

36:15.131 --> 36:17.716
that I suggested
something that I didn't.

36:17.801 --> 36:21.053
Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood .

37:05.223 --> 37:07.099
You dented the car.

37:07.183 --> 37:10.102
I like sleeping on the couch .

37:10.186 --> 37:11.896
I don't like your tone.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.189
Take your shoes off.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.250
Interesting crowd in there.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.881
Same crowd out here.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.509
How about the Einstein thing?

37:42.594 --> 37:45.721
I wonder if old Albert swung his hips
like that when he walked .

37:45.805 --> 37:48.140
She probably got
her hair tips from him , too.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.850
Glen is so quiet.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.518
Not to mention wrinkled .

37:51.603 --> 37:55.356
Maybe she hasn't unpacked
her iron, either.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.609
Christmas paper? Please.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.152
She works.

38:00.236 --> 38:03.155
It has to be hard to run a house, too.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.491
Manning a counter
at a jewelry store?

38:05.575 --> 38:07.159
It's not that demanding.

38:07.243 --> 38:11.163
I don't know. I had a job in sales
before I was a mom .

38:11.247 --> 38:13.165
Have you seen my mom?

38:13.249 --> 38:16.919
No, honey, Maybe she's
in the dining room .

38:19.381 --> 38:20.673
Betty.

38:20.757 --> 38:21.840
What?

38:34.479 --> 38:37.272
Don , will you please go
to Hightop and get the cake?

38:48.952 --> 38:51.870
Hey. Don't run in the house.

38:51.955 --> 38:53.205
What is going on in here?

38:53.289 --> 38:55.332
Your kid knocked over a drink.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.585
You need to tell him
this is not a jungle gym .

38:58.670 --> 39:01.839
Ernie, did you hear what Mr. Farrelly said?

39:03.091 --> 39:06.010
Did you say you were sorry?

39:06.094 --> 39:07.803
Do you want some more?

39:07.887 --> 39:10.597
No. Come on . He heard me.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.726
Go get your mother
and have her clean this up.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.974
Okay. Thank you .

39:57.353 --> 39:58.687
The woman at the bakery said

39:58.772 --> 40:00.898
he picked up the cake
almost an hour ago.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.150
Do you think he had an accident?

40:03.234 --> 40:04.276
Let's go.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.153
We haven't done birthday cake.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.738
There's not going to be a cake.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.948
Am I the only one that knows that?

40:11.242 --> 40:15.496
Don Draper, you are a first class heel,
and I salute you .

40:15.580 --> 40:17.289
Let's go.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.625
Swell party. Food was delicious.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.300
I might have a cake.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.552
A Sara Lee in my freezer.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.721
Well, could you go get it?

40:32.806 --> 40:34.973
Please. That would be so great.

40:44.609 --> 40:49.613
For she's a jolly good fellow

40:49.697 --> 40:53.951
For Sally's a jolly good fellow

40:54.035 --> 41:00.833
Which nobody can deny

41:01.918 --> 41:04.253
Happy Birthday, little lady.

42:21.915 --> 42:23.332
Daddy!

42:31.174 --> 42:32.925
Mommy, Mommy, look!

42:33.009 --> 42:34.760
Daddy got me a doggy!

42:37.513 --> 42:40.224
I don't even know what to say.

42:40.308 --> 42:42.517
I want to name her. . .

42:42.602 --> 42:45.187
Polly! Polly doggy!

42:54.822 --> 42:56.114
Come on .

42:59.202 --> 43:01.662
Hey.

43:04.165 --> 43:05.958
Happy Birthday, baby.

44:07.186 --> 44:10.188
