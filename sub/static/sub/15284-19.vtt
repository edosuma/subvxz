WEBVTT

00:08.217 --> 00:10.418
And let me conclude
by saying

00:10.486 --> 00:12.987
that even though
we've been deemed

00:13.054 --> 00:15.389
the city of tomorrow,

00:15.457 --> 00:18.526
this award says as much
about Bronson Springs today.

00:18.594 --> 00:21.562
I submit that
there is no finer place

00:21.630 --> 00:24.864
in this great country
of ours to call home--

00:24.932 --> 00:27.434
past, present, or future.

00:27.502 --> 00:29.202
[Cheering]

00:29.270 --> 00:30.837
Now, we've got in mind--

00:30.904 --> 00:36.409
we've put together
a little gift basket...

00:36.477 --> 00:37.877
A time capsule,

00:37.945 --> 00:40.179
to be opened in 25 years.

00:40.247 --> 00:42.615
Those people lucky enough

00:42.682 --> 00:46.118
to call Bronson Springs
home in 2013

00:46.186 --> 00:48.254
will have a snapshot

00:48.321 --> 00:50.556
of what made their city
so special

00:50.624 --> 00:54.126
way back here in 1988.

00:54.194 --> 00:56.794
[Cheering and applause]

01:04.537 --> 01:07.539
Woman: Ladies and gentlemen,
we were voted the best in 1988

01:07.606 --> 01:09.073
and we're still
the best now.

01:09.141 --> 01:11.475
Ok, this is the moment
we've been waiting for.

01:11.543 --> 01:13.644
Plug your ears.

01:23.154 --> 01:25.255
Wow, look at that.

01:25.323 --> 01:28.324
I have to say that as mayor,
I am excited to see

01:28.392 --> 01:31.026
what the past will bring us.

01:31.094 --> 01:34.564
Let's open it up
and see what we've got.

01:34.631 --> 01:37.966
Sam, since you were
sitting in the mayor's chair

01:38.034 --> 01:39.435
when all of this started,

01:39.503 --> 01:41.237
it's only fitting
you do the honors.

01:41.305 --> 01:43.305
Thank you. Thank you.

01:43.372 --> 01:45.473
So how many bags
are in there, Sam?

01:45.541 --> 01:47.375
We have 20 bags to open.

01:47.443 --> 01:50.312
Then let's do this while
there's still sunlight.

01:50.379 --> 01:51.580
[Applause]

01:51.647 --> 01:54.549
All right, let's see
what we have here.

01:56.519 --> 01:58.653
Floppy disks.

01:58.721 --> 02:00.454
I see a lot of confused
young faces out there.

02:00.522 --> 02:01.761
Hey, trust me, kids.

02:01.786 --> 02:04.947
Floppy disks really did
used to be floppy.

02:07.095 --> 02:09.196
Ok, now it's my turn.

02:12.701 --> 02:16.001
[Screaming]

02:16.069 --> 02:17.237
Man: Oh, my God!

02:17.304 --> 02:20.506
[Screaming and shouting]

02:26.480 --> 02:28.848
Two days ago, the head
that once belonged

02:28.915 --> 02:32.183
to 23-year-old Wade Burke
rolled out of a time capsule

02:32.252 --> 02:34.119
in Bronson Springs, Colorado,

02:34.186 --> 02:36.321
and I know--I know
this is hardly news--

02:36.389 --> 02:37.822
the video
we are now watching

02:37.890 --> 02:40.592
has already had 1.3 million
views online.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.661
We're being called in
on a cold case?

02:42.729 --> 02:45.464
Sadly, no, because
as of two hours ago,

02:45.531 --> 02:47.865
the decapitation menu
in Bronson Springs

02:47.932 --> 02:51.502
has expanded to include
both cold and hot selections.

02:51.570 --> 02:53.003
It is hard to tell
from this photo--

02:53.071 --> 02:54.338
thank you, friendly universe--

02:54.406 --> 02:56.039
uh, but the latest victim

02:56.107 --> 02:57.642
also does not have
a head attached to him.

02:57.709 --> 02:59.176
Has he been identified?

02:59.244 --> 03:00.878
62-year-old Charlie Figg

03:00.945 --> 03:02.546
is a retired deputy
from Bronson Springs.

03:02.547 --> 03:04.847
His body was found
next to his vehicle

03:04.915 --> 03:06.916
on a remote road
30 miles east of town.

03:06.984 --> 03:08.685
That's a lot of years
in between.

03:08.753 --> 03:09.905
Is there any connection
between the victims?

03:09.906 --> 03:10.922
Nothing that jumps out.

03:10.947 --> 03:13.582
Wade Burke was a clean-cut
honor student type.

03:13.624 --> 03:16.058
Graduated from college
in 1988,

03:16.126 --> 03:18.227
went to work at
the family's carpet business.

03:18.296 --> 03:19.695
Charlie Figg was already
on the job working as a deputy.

03:19.763 --> 03:21.096
It doesn't seem like
their paths crossed.

03:21.164 --> 03:23.332
And Wade Burke's body
was never found.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.669
Well, is it realistic to think
this could be the same killer?

03:26.736 --> 03:28.937
A 25-year dormancy period
is highly unusual.

03:29.005 --> 03:30.539
But not unheard of.

03:30.607 --> 03:31.649
A number of serial killers
have had long intervals

03:31.674 --> 03:33.208
of time between kills.

03:33.209 --> 03:34.810
BTK, Jeffrey Dahmer,
the Keystone Killer.

03:34.877 --> 03:36.744
Jack the Ripper
and the Zodiac Killer

03:36.812 --> 03:38.513
appear to have even
stopped completely.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.581
Then again, there might be
other victims we don't know about.

03:40.649 --> 03:41.982
I don't know,
my gut says copycat.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.184
I mean,
like Garcia said,

03:43.251 --> 03:44.952
this time capsule thing's
been all over the news.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.221
And that video, what was it,
1.3 million hits?

03:47.289 --> 03:47.939
Derek's right.

03:47.964 --> 03:50.653
That's exactly the kind
of high-profile notoriety

03:50.959 --> 03:52.326
that could inspire an imitator.

03:52.393 --> 03:54.227
Whether
it's one unsub or 10,

03:54.295 --> 03:55.929
Bronson Springs is
getting a lot of attention.

03:55.996 --> 03:58.064
And if the killer's
feeding off of publicity,

03:58.132 --> 03:59.999
it'll only encourage him
to strike again.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.601

05:24.171 --> 05:26.091
The removing of heads
has an interesting history.

05:26.139 --> 05:27.607
In medieval times
it was considered

05:27.675 --> 05:29.075
an honorable way
to be executed,

05:29.142 --> 05:30.910
reserved for noblemen
and knights.

05:30.977 --> 05:32.345
Lucky them.

05:32.413 --> 05:33.913
That's not what killed
our latest victim, though.

05:33.980 --> 05:37.115
Charlie Figg died from a single
gunshot wound to the chest.

05:37.183 --> 05:38.950
The head was removed
postmortem.

05:39.018 --> 05:41.022
Garcia, is this the entire
case file from Wade Burke's

05:41.047 --> 05:42.254
1988 disappearance?

05:42.255 --> 05:43.550
That is not a Garcia glitch, sir.

05:43.575 --> 05:44.956
You're looking at all
one page of it.

05:44.957 --> 05:46.791
Well, not much
of an investigation.

05:46.859 --> 05:49.100
Apparently there was no suspicion
of foul play back then.

05:49.161 --> 05:50.119
Well, given what we know now,

05:50.144 --> 05:52.061
will you look a little more
closely into Burke's background?

05:52.062 --> 05:52.963
Yeah, already started
working on it.

05:52.964 --> 05:54.030
Thank you.
Bye.

05:54.132 --> 05:55.733
It wouldn't hurt
to look harder

05:55.800 --> 05:57.501
into Charlie Figg's
history either.

05:57.569 --> 05:59.604
Potential murderers
aren't jumping off the page.

05:59.671 --> 06:02.607
A second set of tire tracks were found
off the side of the road

06:02.674 --> 06:03.874
where Charlie Figg
was killed,

06:03.942 --> 06:05.443
but they weren't able
to pull a tread pattern.

06:05.510 --> 06:07.211
He could have fallen
for a ruse.

06:07.278 --> 06:09.879
Charlie Figg's crime scene
was right out in the open.

06:09.947 --> 06:12.048
It's messy business
removing a head,

06:12.116 --> 06:13.483
time consuming.

06:13.551 --> 06:16.152
The trophy's obviously crucial
to the unsub.

06:16.220 --> 06:19.522
Morgan, you and JJ go talk
to Wade Burke's mother.

06:19.590 --> 06:21.391
Reid, you and Dave
talk to the former mayor,

06:21.459 --> 06:24.227
see who had access to
the 1988 time capsule.

06:24.294 --> 06:26.562
Blake and I will go see what we
can find out about Charlie Figg.

06:26.630 --> 06:28.898
And so the guessing game
begins.

06:28.966 --> 06:31.067
From what nook or cranny

06:31.135 --> 06:34.637
will our new missing head
roll out?

06:38.441 --> 06:39.975
You must be the FBI.

06:40.042 --> 06:41.810
Yes, sir.
I'm Agent Hotchner.

06:41.878 --> 06:43.411
This is Agent Blake.

06:43.479 --> 06:44.880
Sheriff Collier.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.815
Follow me this way.

06:46.883 --> 06:49.985
We got you guys set up
back in the conference room.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.890
So this work for you?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.224
Yes, this is fine.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.760
Uh, we could use a large
case board if you have one?

06:59.828 --> 07:02.196
You can have every case board
in the joint.

07:02.264 --> 07:03.530
Till we get the bastard
that killed Charlie,

07:03.598 --> 07:05.432
there's only one active
investigation

07:05.500 --> 07:06.867
going on in Bronson Springs.

07:06.935 --> 07:09.703
Who in the department
knew Charlie Figg best?

07:09.771 --> 07:11.205
You're looking at him.

07:11.273 --> 07:14.207
When I first joined,
Charlie took me under his wing.

07:14.275 --> 07:16.375
He was like my father,
my older brother,

07:16.443 --> 07:18.244
my best friend
all rolled into one.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.647
Exemplary family man,
just a stellar human being.

07:21.715 --> 07:24.550
Any idea what Charlie was doing
in the area where he was found?

07:24.618 --> 07:25.819
It's fairly remote.

07:25.886 --> 07:27.086
Charlie liked to hunt.

07:27.154 --> 07:29.454
There's no law against that
last I checked.

07:29.522 --> 07:31.489
Sheriff, I'm not being
antagonistic.

07:31.557 --> 07:33.192
We're here to help you.

07:33.259 --> 07:35.560
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

07:35.628 --> 07:37.296
It just, uh--
[Clears throat]--

07:37.363 --> 07:39.763
you know those stages of grief
you're supposed to go through,

07:39.799 --> 07:41.733
shock, denial, and whatever?

07:41.801 --> 07:44.768
Well, I skipped past all that,
I went straight to anger.

07:44.837 --> 07:46.570
That's where I am and that
is where I'm gonna stay

07:46.638 --> 07:49.640
until we get the son of
a bitch who did this.

07:50.742 --> 07:54.578
Mrs. Burke, we're so sorry
about your son.

07:54.646 --> 07:58.082
People have been calling me
the past 3 days.

07:58.150 --> 08:01.184
They all say that
at least I have closure now.

08:01.252 --> 08:04.321
All the times I've walked
across that courthouse lawn,

08:04.388 --> 08:08.325
now I know that Wade
was under there the whole time.

08:10.094 --> 08:12.395
My little boy...

08:13.931 --> 08:16.765
buried in the ground
in that metal tube.

08:16.833 --> 08:20.870
My husband
didn't get closure.

08:20.937 --> 08:24.974
He went to his grave
not knowing.

08:25.041 --> 08:27.042
Who's the lucky one,

08:27.110 --> 08:28.677
him or me?

08:28.745 --> 08:30.645
25 years ago,

08:30.713 --> 08:33.581
police felt that your son
left on is own, voluntarily.

08:33.648 --> 08:35.582
Did you also believe that?

08:35.650 --> 08:37.551
Yes.

08:37.619 --> 08:39.720
The weeks before
he disappeared,

08:39.788 --> 08:41.756
Wade talked
about leaving.

08:41.823 --> 08:43.924
He wanted a change.

08:43.993 --> 08:47.228
Your son graduated with
a degree in electrical engineering.

08:47.296 --> 08:48.561
That's right.

08:48.629 --> 08:52.199
But he worked for the family
carpet business in sales?

08:54.135 --> 08:56.904
My husband was a good man.

08:56.971 --> 09:01.375
But he could be...
controlling.

09:01.442 --> 09:03.610
He wanted
to keep Wade close.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.078
Keep him close why?

09:08.815 --> 09:11.217
Is there anything else?

09:11.285 --> 09:13.652
I'd like to go now.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.358
Here's the list of names
you asked about.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.961
These are the 20 people
who put a bag in the capsule?

09:23.029 --> 09:24.329
Yes, sir.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.199
I don't think you're gonna find
any killers on that list.

09:28.267 --> 09:31.702
Grade school kids,
local businessmen, PTA types.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.204
The name we need
is whoever

09:33.272 --> 09:35.307
put the 21st bag
in the capsule.

09:35.374 --> 09:37.507
Now, this is--
this is where we did it,

09:37.575 --> 09:38.708
right in here.

09:38.776 --> 09:42.212
The bags went in,
capsule got sealed,

09:42.280 --> 09:45.515
the next morning,
took it outside and buried it.

09:45.583 --> 09:49.653
Forensics found the seal had been cut
and then carefully resealed.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.021
The unsub must have

09:51.089 --> 09:53.356
broken into the courthouse
the night before,

09:53.424 --> 09:55.959
cracked open the seal,
and put in the head.

09:56.026 --> 09:57.393
Why wasn't the capsule
guarded?

09:57.461 --> 09:59.262
It was a different world
then, son.

09:59.330 --> 10:02.065
Back then, folks in Bronson Springs
didn't lock their doors,

10:02.132 --> 10:03.699
kids rode their bikes
after dark.

10:03.767 --> 10:07.103
Didn't occur to anybody
the damn thing needed guarding.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.236
Hey, Wanda.

10:08.304 --> 10:09.237
Sam.

10:09.305 --> 10:12.574

10:12.641 --> 10:15.610
and Dr. Reid of the FBI.

10:15.678 --> 10:18.646
Wanda Sullivan is the editor
of our local newspaper.

10:18.714 --> 10:21.116
Nice to meet you, and thank you
for what you're doing for us.

10:21.184 --> 10:22.884
I've already
looked through them.

10:22.952 --> 10:25.786
Nobody lurking in the background
with a hatchet.

10:25.854 --> 10:28.722
Wanda here
took these pictures.

10:28.790 --> 10:32.193
She was just brand-new
at the paper back then.

10:32.260 --> 10:34.595
Is the FBI gonna be at
the town meeting tonight?

10:34.662 --> 10:36.563
Rossi: Uh, yes, ma'am.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.300
Do you think it's smart?

10:39.368 --> 10:41.667
People hear that
the FBI is in town,

10:41.735 --> 10:43.003
they're gonna
get scared.

10:43.070 --> 10:46.239
No offense, but I think
it's the head without the body

10:46.307 --> 10:49.642
and the body without the head
that has the people scared.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.777
We'll just be there
to answer questions,

10:51.845 --> 10:53.980
hopefully give some
reassurance.

10:54.048 --> 10:56.181
I think it's a mistake.

10:56.249 --> 10:57.416
Bye.

10:58.918 --> 11:00.052
Was it my cologne?

11:00.120 --> 11:01.620
Don't take it personal.

11:01.687 --> 11:04.056
We used to call her
Cyclone Sullivan.

11:04.124 --> 11:05.757
You know, back in '88,

11:05.825 --> 11:08.394
once she got a whiff
that Bronson Springs

11:08.461 --> 11:11.363
was on the short list
for city of the future award,

11:11.431 --> 11:13.264
she, uh--well...

11:13.332 --> 11:15.900
We were gonna win
that sucker or else.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.402
She made it her personal
business

11:17.469 --> 11:20.571
to keep the folks
in this town in line.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.241
How did she manage that?

11:23.308 --> 11:24.742
Well, the first thing
she did

11:24.809 --> 11:28.478
was put a crime blotter type
column in the newspaper.

11:28.546 --> 11:31.915
Every morning she'd publish stories
about people's run-ins

11:31.982 --> 11:33.950
with the law. [Laughing]

11:34.018 --> 11:36.353
Shame the townspeople
into good behavior.

11:36.421 --> 11:38.755
Yeah, that was the idea.

11:38.822 --> 11:40.857
Do you think you could
get us copies

11:40.925 --> 11:43.993
of those newspaper
columns from that time?

11:44.061 --> 11:46.429
This could be someone
holding a grudge.

11:46.496 --> 11:47.996
You bet.

11:48.998 --> 11:51.867
Ah...It feels like
a different world.

11:51.935 --> 11:55.771
Sometimes I wish I could crawl back
in that time capsule

11:55.838 --> 11:58.441
and just...
put it in reverse.

11:58.508 --> 12:00.141
Well, you know
what they say.

12:00.209 --> 12:01.876
Progress
was a wonderful thing,

12:01.944 --> 12:04.045
it just went on
too long.

12:05.247 --> 12:06.647
Hey, I got something.

12:06.715 --> 12:09.717
So I dug deeper into
our boy scout Wade Burke...

12:09.785 --> 12:10.718
And?

12:10.786 --> 12:11.953
Not much a boy scout.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.054
How so?

12:13.122 --> 12:15.056
How so is that while
Wade was away in college,

12:15.124 --> 12:19.025
he had 6--6 cases
of public intoxication,

12:19.094 --> 12:22.296
including one involving
a hit-and-run with a pedestrian

12:22.363 --> 12:23.363
in a crosswalk.

12:23.431 --> 12:25.031
Why wasn't any of that
on his record?

12:25.100 --> 12:26.800
Because daddy's big fat
bank account

12:26.867 --> 12:29.570
comes with a big fat eraser,
so anytime Wade did something wrong,

12:29.637 --> 12:30.904
it just got swept
under the rug.

12:30.972 --> 12:32.271
No pun intended.
Get it?

12:32.339 --> 12:34.773
Because the Burke family
business is rug manufacturing.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.509
So carpet--sweeping it
under the--

12:36.577 --> 12:38.411
Yeah, got it, Garcia.

12:38.479 --> 12:39.412
Ok.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.080
That would explain
why his father

12:41.148 --> 12:42.415
kept him on a short leash.

12:42.483 --> 12:43.516
Thanks, Morgan.

12:43.584 --> 12:45.684
Morgan says the M.E.
confirmed that

12:45.752 --> 12:47.487
it was the same saw that
cut off both the heads

12:47.554 --> 12:49.254
of Wade Burke
and Charlie Figg.

12:49.322 --> 12:51.323
So we're dealing with
a single unsub.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.925
Wait. You're saying
the same guy

12:53.993 --> 12:55.927
killed Wade Burke
and Charlie?

12:55.995 --> 12:57.629
He just changed his M.O.

12:57.696 --> 12:59.030
Burke's body
was never found,

12:59.098 --> 13:00.599
and Charlie's body
was left in a place

13:00.666 --> 13:02.334
where it would be
discovered almost immediately.

13:02.401 --> 13:04.235
The killer wants to let everyone
know he's back in business.

13:04.302 --> 13:06.504
And he's shown
preference for an audience.

13:06.571 --> 13:08.272
The town hall
meeting tonight.

13:08.340 --> 13:09.473
Well, maybe we better
cancel it.

13:09.541 --> 13:11.475
No, it'll be helpful
to observe those who attend.

13:11.543 --> 13:13.368
Observe what? The guy's
not gonna show up dragging

13:13.393 --> 13:15.340
a hacksaw behind him.

13:15.413 --> 13:17.948
This is a killer who had the
patience to wait 25 years.

13:18.016 --> 13:19.283
That's uncommon.

13:19.351 --> 13:20.883
And, Sheriff,
that distinctiveness

13:20.951 --> 13:23.085
might show itself
in other ways.

13:35.966 --> 13:37.399
My kids are afraid to go out
with their friends.

13:37.467 --> 13:39.135
What am I supposed
to tell them?

13:39.202 --> 13:41.837
We'll answer all of your questions
as soon as the meeting comes to order.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.505
I'm here now.
Can't I ask a simple question?

13:43.573 --> 13:46.440
It's ok, Tom.
We understand your frustration,

13:46.508 --> 13:47.876
but that's why we asked
the FBI to help.

13:47.943 --> 13:49.243
Their top profilers
are here.

13:49.311 --> 13:51.312
What happens if another
person gets their head chopped off

13:51.380 --> 13:52.580
while they're
busy profiling?

13:52.648 --> 13:55.416
Sir, the best thing anyone
can do is stay calm

13:55.484 --> 13:56.417
and be vigilant.

13:56.485 --> 13:57.752
The investigation
is underway.

13:57.820 --> 13:59.087
Do you have any leads?

13:59.155 --> 14:00.420
JJ: Nothing concrete, no.

14:00.488 --> 14:03.356
But we are narrowing
the parameters of the search.

14:04.225 --> 14:05.192
Hotch.

14:05.259 --> 14:06.960
I got him.

14:07.028 --> 14:10.297
JJ: That's why we are suggesting
people travel in pairs

14:10.364 --> 14:13.200
and make sure your doors
and windows are securely locked.

14:13.267 --> 14:15.135
This guy's cutting off
heads.

14:15.203 --> 14:16.535
Do you think locking a window
is gonna stop him?

14:16.603 --> 14:19.572
Mayor: Folks, during our
question and answer period,

14:19.639 --> 14:21.407
everyone will be given
a chance to talk.

14:21.474 --> 14:24.210
Please, try to hold your questions
till everyone is present.

14:24.277 --> 14:26.145
No, no, wait!

14:26.213 --> 14:28.047
Get your hands
behind your back!

14:28.115 --> 14:30.083
It's a joke!
Come on, man,

14:30.150 --> 14:31.417
we were just
messing around.

14:31.484 --> 14:33.384
Get up.

14:33.452 --> 14:35.286
My buddies and me
were drinking.

14:35.354 --> 14:37.723
They dared me
to come here and do this.

14:37.790 --> 14:39.958
It's just a joke.

14:40.026 --> 14:42.094
Get him out of here.

14:43.529 --> 14:45.230
Everything's under control.

14:50.268 --> 14:52.469
It looked like there could
have been a head in that bag.

14:52.470 --> 14:53.901
That's why I wanted you
to hold off.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.606
He was much
too young to be the unsub.

14:55.607 --> 14:57.200
If the real killer was
going to show,

14:57.225 --> 14:59.110
you may have spooked him now.

14:59.111 --> 15:01.178
I'm sorry.

15:17.261 --> 15:18.461
No, no, no, no, no.

15:18.528 --> 15:21.196
Absolutely not.
I want you to write it up,

15:21.264 --> 15:22.597
then I want to bury it. Ok?

15:22.665 --> 15:24.366
Look, it's a fiasco,

15:24.433 --> 15:26.068
just like I knew it would be.

15:26.136 --> 15:29.337
Yeah, but we're not gonna throw
more flame on the fire now.

15:29.405 --> 15:31.539
Look, just email me your copy.

15:31.607 --> 15:33.541
I want to look at it
before we publish tomorrow.

15:33.609 --> 15:35.244
Ok? Thanks.

15:39.047 --> 15:40.447
Hello, Wanda.

15:40.515 --> 15:41.949
[Gasps]

15:42.017 --> 15:43.350
[Gunshot]

15:54.881 --> 15:56.149
He took her head.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.316
[Zips bag]

15:57.383 --> 15:58.783
The whole world's gone crazy.

15:58.851 --> 16:00.219
Sheriff, this wasn't random.

16:00.286 --> 16:02.554
She was targeted and stalked
just like the other victims.

16:02.622 --> 16:04.823
Who would do a thing
like this?

16:04.890 --> 16:08.326
Wanda Sullivan was a big
anti-drug crusader, right?

16:08.393 --> 16:09.960
Rossi said that's what
the ex-mayor told him.

16:10.028 --> 16:13.231
Well, they found that
in her garden.

16:13.298 --> 16:16.167
She was cultivating a nice
patch of marijuana for herself.

16:16.235 --> 16:18.536
Guess she wasn't as squeaky
clean as she appeared to be.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.871
And Wade Burke
was the perfect student

16:20.939 --> 16:23.140
who turned out
to not be so perfect.

16:23.207 --> 16:24.975
Maybe that's the connection.

16:25.043 --> 16:26.810
The unsub's targeting people
whose private lives

16:26.878 --> 16:28.545
don't measure up
to their public image.

16:28.613 --> 16:29.629
We should take a closer look

16:29.654 --> 16:31.215
at the private lives
of all the victims.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.692
[Knock on door]

16:42.760 --> 16:44.560
[Door opens]

16:44.628 --> 16:47.130
Thought I heard you in here.

16:47.197 --> 16:50.833
Hey. Thought we had rules
about coming into the man cave.

16:50.901 --> 16:53.569
Even when it's to announce
your breakfast is ready?

16:53.637 --> 16:57.405
Ok. Special exemption.

16:57.473 --> 17:00.042
[Chuckles]

17:00.109 --> 17:02.778
Hey, I'll be in
in a couple of minutes.

17:02.845 --> 17:04.212
Ok.

17:05.048 --> 17:06.247
Hey.

17:06.315 --> 17:08.983
Did you know that guy?

17:09.818 --> 17:11.719
Which guy?

17:11.787 --> 17:14.555
Wade Burke.

17:14.622 --> 17:16.557
The one whose head
was in the capsule?

17:16.624 --> 17:18.059
No.

17:18.126 --> 17:19.326
Why?

17:19.394 --> 17:23.363
You guys were just about
the same age. That's all.

17:23.431 --> 17:25.098
Thought maybe.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.901
No. Paths never crossed.

17:30.437 --> 17:33.873
You better come eat
before your eggs get cold.

17:41.715 --> 17:43.215
Thanks.

17:43.282 --> 17:44.649
[Door opens]

17:44.718 --> 17:47.119
Agent Hotchner. Jim here

17:47.187 --> 17:49.554
talked to Wanda
Sullivan's neighbors--

17:49.622 --> 17:51.724
Sheriff, when you referred to Charlie Figg
as an exemplary family man,

17:51.791 --> 17:53.325
to which of his families
were you referring?

17:53.392 --> 17:55.828
The family he kept here in Bronson Springs
that everybody knew about,

17:55.895 --> 17:59.697
or the second secret family
he kept 3 hours east?

17:59.765 --> 18:02.333
Jim, can you give us
a minute?

18:05.270 --> 18:06.470
How'd you find out
about that?

18:06.538 --> 18:08.172
Is there anything else
you haven't told us about?

18:08.240 --> 18:09.506
Nothing.
Are you sure?

18:09.574 --> 18:11.776
Really. Nothing.

18:11.844 --> 18:13.544
Look, Agent Hotchner,

18:13.612 --> 18:17.114
Charlie had some, uh,
some issues in his personal life.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.615
That's true.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.751
But it didn't affect
his work as a cop.

18:20.818 --> 18:22.552
But it does affect
our profile.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.387
So you've got a few minutes
to prepare your officers.

18:24.455 --> 18:27.290
They're going to hear
some things they're not gonna like.

18:27.358 --> 18:29.392
We're looking for
a physically fit male

18:29.460 --> 18:31.260
between the ages
of 45 and 55.

18:31.327 --> 18:34.363
And he's targeting people
that he perceives as hypocrites.

18:34.430 --> 18:37.532
In the 1980s, Wade Burke won
student citizenship awards,

18:37.600 --> 18:39.034
but in fact
had significant,

18:39.102 --> 18:41.102
repeated brushes with the law
that were covered up.

18:41.104 --> 18:44.240
Wanda Sullivan was
a fervent anti-drug activist

18:44.307 --> 18:47.075
yet secretly grew her own
stash of marijuana.

18:47.143 --> 18:49.424
And Charlie Figg broke the law
that he was sworn to uphold

18:49.444 --> 18:51.712
by illegally maintaining
a second family.

18:51.781 --> 18:54.715
This need to punish hypocrisy
might have been triggered

18:54.784 --> 18:57.685
when Bronson Springs was
given the award as the perfect city,

18:57.753 --> 19:00.054
being held up as an example
for the future.

19:00.122 --> 19:02.922
If the unsub felt victimized or
that an injustice had been done to him,

19:02.924 --> 19:05.092
it might have motivated
his need for revenge,

19:05.160 --> 19:07.680
not just against Wade Burke
but against the entire city as well.

19:07.728 --> 19:09.930
This person has
extraordinary patience.

19:09.998 --> 19:12.432
He put the head of his first victim
in a time capsule,

19:12.500 --> 19:14.324
knowing that it'd be
25 years before people

19:14.349 --> 19:15.903
would know what he'd done.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.204
Blake: He always spends
a great deal of time

19:18.272 --> 19:19.839
meticulously
planning his kills.

19:19.907 --> 19:23.409
So look at professions that
would reflect this type of mindset.

19:23.476 --> 19:27.680
Artisans, uh, those who work
long hours in solitude...

19:27.747 --> 19:29.047
perfectionists.

19:29.115 --> 19:31.417
How did this guy keep
from killing all those years?

19:31.484 --> 19:34.420
We call it self-initiated
predation cessation.

19:34.487 --> 19:36.689
Most serial killers are unable
to control their own impulses,

19:36.756 --> 19:38.490
but some seem to be able
to self-regulate.

19:38.558 --> 19:41.058
It's like they have an on/off switch
that they themselves can control.

19:41.126 --> 19:42.886
Morgan: The secret of
the head in the capsule

19:42.928 --> 19:45.229
was probably enough to sustain
him during this dormant phase.

19:45.297 --> 19:47.898
And when the time capsule
finally was opened,

19:47.966 --> 19:50.368
it was like an alarm clock
going off,

19:50.436 --> 19:52.804
a wake-up call
to resume killing.

19:52.871 --> 19:54.972
He witnessed the fear
it instilled in the town

19:55.040 --> 19:56.906
and he wanted to keep
that panic going.

19:56.974 --> 19:59.609
He's collecting heads
again for a purpose.

19:59.677 --> 20:02.546
We think the unsub
is preparing for his next statement.

20:02.613 --> 20:04.681
And this statement
will be bigger and bolder,

20:04.749 --> 20:07.016
and he's not going
to wait 25 years.

20:07.084 --> 20:08.352
Thank you.

20:10.488 --> 20:12.021
[Door opens]

20:13.690 --> 20:15.791
Bet you thought I forgot.

20:15.859 --> 20:17.593
Forgot what?

20:17.661 --> 20:21.296
Our anniversary.

20:21.365 --> 20:25.000
What are you talking about?

20:25.068 --> 20:28.170
Our anniversary
isn't until October.

20:28.238 --> 20:31.806
I'm talking about the anniversary
of the day we first met.

20:33.909 --> 20:37.144
22 years ago today.

20:37.212 --> 20:38.413
You remember?

20:38.481 --> 20:40.682
I sure do.

20:41.817 --> 20:43.284
I was a waitress

20:43.352 --> 20:46.152
in that little
restaurant in Pueblo.

20:46.220 --> 20:48.689
You were the new fry cook.

20:48.757 --> 20:49.623
Dishwasher.

20:49.691 --> 20:52.426
Let's keep it honest.

20:52.494 --> 20:54.294
Talk about fate.

20:54.362 --> 20:56.730
Two kids from Bronson Springs

20:56.798 --> 20:58.265
who grew up 3 miles
from each other

20:58.332 --> 21:00.333
had to go all the way
across the state

21:00.401 --> 21:01.901
to meet and fall in love.

21:01.968 --> 21:03.636
Must have been destiny.

21:03.704 --> 21:06.806
That's exactly what it was--

21:06.874 --> 21:09.208
destiny.

21:09.276 --> 21:13.413
Listen, I gotta go run
some errands this morning.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.448
I'll see you later on?

21:22.988 --> 21:25.524
[Quacking]

21:32.631 --> 21:34.331
Morning.

21:34.399 --> 21:36.300
Morning.

21:36.367 --> 21:37.501
They biting?

21:37.569 --> 21:39.737
Ah, nibbling.

21:39.805 --> 21:41.739
Did manage to, uh,

21:41.807 --> 21:44.408
hook a good-sized trout
about an hour ago.

21:44.476 --> 21:46.410
Yeah? Where is it?

21:46.478 --> 21:48.578
Oh, tossed it back.

21:48.646 --> 21:50.547
Catch and release.

21:50.614 --> 21:52.882
Is that the law?

21:52.950 --> 21:54.717
Oh, more of a common courtesy.

21:54.785 --> 21:58.220
Keeps our lakes and streams
full of fish for everybody.

21:58.288 --> 22:00.757
That's nice.

22:00.825 --> 22:03.059
Except for the fish.

22:03.126 --> 22:05.527
Hook goes in your mouth,
gets torn out,

22:05.595 --> 22:07.563
get tossed back,

22:07.630 --> 22:10.732
so somebody else
can do the same thing.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.001
You eat fish?

22:13.069 --> 22:14.870
Sure.

22:14.938 --> 22:16.538
Me, too.

22:16.606 --> 22:18.540
Love fish.

22:18.608 --> 22:21.141
Healthy.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.678
You cook 'em with
the head on or off?

22:23.745 --> 22:25.613
Usually on.

22:25.681 --> 22:27.114
Not me.

22:27.182 --> 22:29.717
Last thing I need

22:29.785 --> 22:32.820
is some beady pair of eyes
looking up at me

22:32.888 --> 22:34.722
while I'm trying to eat.

22:34.790 --> 22:37.624
I always take the head off.

22:37.692 --> 22:39.960
Whhtt!

22:41.762 --> 22:45.999
Well, I think it's time
for me to leave. Uh...

22:46.066 --> 22:47.767
Nice talking to you.

22:47.835 --> 22:50.136
Sorry, Mr. Backus.

22:51.806 --> 22:54.006
When I catch,
I don't release.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.274
[Gunshot]

22:56.342 --> 22:59.044
[Squawking]

22:59.980 --> 23:00.913
[Cell phone rings]

23:00.981 --> 23:02.882
Penelope Garcia beaming in.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.316
Hey, throw me a bone,
baby girl.

23:04.384 --> 23:07.019
Oh, lover, I'm tossing you
a 24-ounce tofu steak.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.020
So I cross-checked
the newspaper crime column

23:09.087 --> 23:11.188
with the sheriff
dispatch records,

23:11.256 --> 23:13.858
and on the night
of July 18, 1988--

23:13.926 --> 23:16.528
that would be one month
before Wade Burke vanished--

23:16.595 --> 23:18.963
a deputy responded
to a possible sexual assault

23:19.031 --> 23:20.532
on the 400 block
of Ferndale Road.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.333
Now, 3 things are
interesting about this.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.802
One--the deputy that
responded was Charlie Figg.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.004
2--this incident
and only this incident

23:27.072 --> 23:29.340
was omitted from Wanda
Sullivan's crime blotter column,

23:29.408 --> 23:33.277
and 3--pregnant pause
to ratchet up dramatic tension--

23:33.345 --> 23:35.446
if you go down Ferndale Road
half a mile,

23:35.514 --> 23:39.450
that's where Wade Burke worked
at his family's carpet business.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.584
We got another one.

23:41.652 --> 23:44.620
Todd Backus, 72-year-old
widower, retired,

23:44.688 --> 23:46.622
lives by himself
not too far from here.

23:46.690 --> 23:47.723
Who found him?

23:47.791 --> 23:49.225
Local fisherman.
Said the victim

23:49.293 --> 23:50.726
liked to come
to this spot a lot.

23:50.794 --> 23:54.097
This unsub has a confidence
bordering on recklessness.

23:54.165 --> 23:56.066
Anybody could have
witnessed this.

23:56.133 --> 23:57.566
Yeah, but nobody did,
you know?

23:57.633 --> 23:59.501
Not here, not on the county road
with Charlie Figg,

23:59.569 --> 24:01.002
not at Wanda Sullivan's
house.

24:01.071 --> 24:04.406
This unsub's either
very lucky or very good.

24:04.474 --> 24:08.577
Well, up until now,
all of the victims in some way

24:08.644 --> 24:12.081
circle back to Wade Burke
and his family.

24:12.148 --> 24:14.748
I wonder how...

24:14.816 --> 24:18.152
Mr. Backus here figures in.

24:19.421 --> 24:20.521
[Knock on door]

24:20.589 --> 24:22.390
Tory?

24:24.259 --> 24:27.861
Permission to enter man cave?

24:27.929 --> 24:32.365
If you want dinner tonight,
you better let me in.

24:56.423 --> 24:59.291
Garcia, you have
anything yet on Todd Backus?

24:59.359 --> 25:01.127
What I have
is a frustration headache.

25:01.194 --> 25:03.394
I love digging up dirt.

25:03.462 --> 25:04.362
But?

25:04.430 --> 25:06.397
But it's like Todd Backus...

25:06.465 --> 25:09.001
He's never done anything
wrong in his entire life.

25:09.068 --> 25:10.301
He's originally from Missouri.

25:10.369 --> 25:12.838
He's been married happily
to the same woman

25:12.905 --> 25:14.740
for the last 45 years.
3 grown kids.

25:14.807 --> 25:16.875
Hotch: When did he move
to Bronson Springs?

25:16.943 --> 25:18.909
Let me see.

25:18.977 --> 25:21.879
Oh. 1988.

25:21.947 --> 25:23.681
April of 1988.

25:23.749 --> 25:26.250
A few months before
Wade Burke disappeared.

25:41.666 --> 25:44.000
Oh my God!

25:44.068 --> 25:45.501
Oh, my God.

25:45.569 --> 25:47.871
I wish
you hadn't seen that.

25:57.816 --> 25:59.317
So we know
the first 3 victims

25:59.385 --> 26:00.722
were all directly tied
to the sexual assault

26:00.747 --> 26:02.612
incident on July 18, 1988.

26:02.821 --> 26:06.491
But we don't know the identity of the
person who was attacked.

26:06.559 --> 26:09.294
It's a good bet it was Wade Burke
committing the assault.

26:09.362 --> 26:13.398
Given his track record and proximity
to the Burke family business,

26:13.466 --> 26:15.166
it had to be him.

26:15.233 --> 26:18.169
Charlie Figg was
the responding officer.

26:18.236 --> 26:20.436
He was working patrol
alone that night.

26:20.504 --> 26:23.640
And Wanda Sullivan omitted
mentioning it in her column.

26:24.909 --> 26:27.044
Ok, so where does
Todd Backus fit in?

26:27.111 --> 26:28.845
Baby girl,
do we know why Backus

26:28.913 --> 26:31.514
came out to Bronson Springs
in the first place?

26:31.582 --> 26:32.937
Yeah, to seek employment.

26:32.962 --> 26:35.422
He had lost his job in
Kansas City the year before.

26:35.653 --> 26:36.918
Did he find work?

26:36.986 --> 26:39.354
Eventually he started
punching a time clock again

26:39.422 --> 26:41.690
by July 28, 1988.

26:41.757 --> 26:43.525
10 days after
the incident?

26:43.593 --> 26:45.627
That can't be a coincidence.
Who hired him?

26:45.695 --> 26:47.796
He was hired at MB Fabrics,

26:47.863 --> 26:50.732
and that is owned
by Burke carpeting. There it is.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.766
Wade Burke's father
gave Backus a job.

26:52.834 --> 26:55.670
Where was Backus living
the night of July 18,

26:55.737 --> 26:57.017
when the sexual assault
happened?

26:57.072 --> 26:58.172
The first two weeks
he was living

26:58.240 --> 26:59.940
in like a temporary
hotely type place,

27:00.008 --> 27:01.089
then his family joined him,

27:01.114 --> 27:03.224
they moved to a small
apartment, 415 Ferndale.

27:03.245 --> 27:07.615
Which is just down the road from
where the sexual assault was reported.

27:07.683 --> 27:09.449
Aah!

27:09.517 --> 27:11.384
Backus witnessed it.

27:14.088 --> 27:15.622
JJ: He called it in
to the police.

27:15.690 --> 27:18.358
And the job offer
was to keep him quiet.

27:20.661 --> 27:22.929
Please, don't!

27:22.996 --> 27:24.363
I'm not going to hurt you.

27:24.431 --> 27:27.099
I just can't have you messing
this up after all I've done.

27:27.166 --> 27:30.102
I need to finish a few things
and then we'll do it.

27:30.169 --> 27:31.203
Do what?

27:31.271 --> 27:33.939
Teach this town a lesson
they'll never forget.

27:37.076 --> 27:38.477
[Pounding on door]
Please!

27:38.545 --> 27:40.478
No, please!

27:40.546 --> 27:43.414
Please, no!

27:43.482 --> 27:45.683
Guys, I got another something.
Wade Burke's father

27:45.751 --> 27:47.231
was cooking the books
at his business.

27:47.253 --> 27:48.419
How so?

27:48.487 --> 27:50.355
July 21st, 3 days after
the incident,

27:50.422 --> 27:53.358
he made a one-time $30,000
payment to a Clarence Tipton.

27:53.425 --> 27:55.727
He charged it off
as a consulting fee.

27:55.794 --> 27:57.761
Do we know who
Clarence Tipton is?

27:57.828 --> 27:59.730
Yes, and the only thing
he would be good at consulting about

27:59.797 --> 28:03.199
is like welfare fraud
and not getting employed.

28:03.268 --> 28:05.001
The 30,000 was hush money.

28:05.069 --> 28:07.904
Clarence Tipton and his wife Arlene
moved out of Bronson Springs

28:07.972 --> 28:09.373
shortly after all this happened.

28:09.440 --> 28:13.008
I'm shooting you their new address
right now. There it is.

28:13.076 --> 28:17.012
Kirkwood? That's less than
an hour north of here.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.615
That money come to us
fair and square,

28:19.683 --> 28:21.684
and it's already spent,

28:21.752 --> 28:23.719
so you can't get it back

28:23.787 --> 28:26.555
if that's what all this
is about.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.757
The money
was a consulting fee.

28:28.824 --> 28:31.025
That's right.

28:31.093 --> 28:34.329
Do you remember
what business Mr. Burke was in

28:34.397 --> 28:37.799
that he asked you
to consult?

28:39.201 --> 28:41.436
The money we got had
nothing to do with that.

28:41.504 --> 28:44.205
What the hell
is the difference, Clarence?

28:44.273 --> 28:48.074
Practically everybody from
then is dead now, anyway.

28:49.477 --> 28:53.447
Our daughter got raped
by that boy.

28:53.515 --> 28:55.982
Yes.
Wade Burke.

28:56.050 --> 28:57.984
And the money
was part of the cover-up.

28:58.052 --> 29:00.486
They was gonna drag
all our names through the gutter

29:00.554 --> 29:01.821
if we went to trial.

29:01.888 --> 29:04.023
She was only barely 16.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.958
After what that boy
did to her,

29:06.026 --> 29:08.728
she had to take pills
for depression.

29:08.796 --> 29:11.631
I'll say it and I mean it.

29:11.699 --> 29:14.567
I'm glad that boy's head
turned up like it did.

29:14.635 --> 29:16.535
Where's your daughter now?

29:16.602 --> 29:20.271
She moved to the other side of
the state since she turned 18.

29:20.340 --> 29:23.174
We haven't heard one word
from her since.

29:23.242 --> 29:27.412
Thanks to the price tag
you and Mr. Burke put on her.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.415
I don't have to sit
and listen to this.

29:39.491 --> 29:41.759
Hold on a second.

29:45.831 --> 29:48.698
I keep this hidden
from my husband.

29:48.766 --> 29:51.634
The son of a bitch would throw
it away if he knew I had that.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.102
This is your daughter?

29:53.170 --> 29:56.473
Yeah. That's the only thing I
have left of her to remember.

29:56.540 --> 29:58.808
I'm sorry, ma'am.

29:58.876 --> 30:01.077
We lost her that night.

30:01.144 --> 30:04.313
Lost her from our lives
as if she'd...

30:04.381 --> 30:05.947
been killed dead.

30:12.689 --> 30:14.656
Tory?

30:14.724 --> 30:17.092
Tory, are you out there?

30:42.049 --> 30:44.751
Aah! No!

30:44.819 --> 30:46.853
You need to settle,
Leanne.

30:46.921 --> 30:50.390
You gotta trust me
on this.

30:50.458 --> 30:51.691
There.

30:51.759 --> 30:53.258
[Breathing hard]

30:53.326 --> 30:55.327
That's better.

30:56.430 --> 30:58.664
I located Leanne Tipton,
who worked briefly

30:58.732 --> 31:00.265
at a restaurant in Pueblo
in 1990,

31:00.333 --> 31:01.934
but then she disappeared again
later on that year.

31:02.001 --> 31:03.536
So either she went
way off the grid

31:03.603 --> 31:05.538
or she changed her identity
again, 'cause I can't find her.

31:05.605 --> 31:08.673
So I'm reattaching my snorkel
and goggles, diving back in.

31:10.008 --> 31:11.042
What's that?

31:11.109 --> 31:13.110
The rape case file from 1988.

31:13.178 --> 31:14.412
Charlie had it at his house.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.181
You knew it was there
this whole time?

31:17.249 --> 31:18.917
No, ma'am.

31:18.984 --> 31:21.319
We all take home files
now and then.

31:21.386 --> 31:24.355
Except sometimes Charlie's
files wouldn't come back.

31:24.423 --> 31:27.524
I took a chance that maybe
that's what happened this time.

31:27.592 --> 31:30.160
His wife Sandy showed me
where he kept them.

31:30.227 --> 31:31.929
This is the rape
victim's statement.

31:31.996 --> 31:34.040
Sheriff, has this building

31:34.065 --> 31:36.154
undergone any sort of
renovations since 1988?

31:36.267 --> 31:38.836
Not really. It's been
pretty much like this forever.

31:38.903 --> 31:40.670
What are you
thinking, Hotch?

31:40.737 --> 31:42.972
The unsub knew everything
that happened that night.

31:43.039 --> 31:45.641
What was discussed
and the people involved.

31:45.709 --> 31:47.910
There were only 3 other
employees working

31:47.935 --> 31:48.811
the station that night

31:48.812 --> 31:50.513
and none of them
are still alive.

31:50.581 --> 31:52.682
Maybe one of them
told somebody.

31:52.749 --> 31:55.685
Not likely. A lie this big
is too hard to maintain.

31:55.752 --> 31:58.419
Sheriff, where would the victim
have given her statement?

31:58.488 --> 32:01.923
Right over there
where the deputy is standing.

32:03.860 --> 32:06.060
And the accused Wade Burke, where
would he have been held?

32:06.128 --> 32:07.863
In there.

32:11.233 --> 32:13.333
Was this area always
used for storage?

32:13.401 --> 32:16.269
No, up till a couple years ago
it was a temporary holding cell.

32:16.337 --> 32:18.606
Blake: That's it.

32:18.673 --> 32:21.274
The unsub didn't hear
about the cover-up, he witnessed it.

32:21.342 --> 32:25.746
Garcia, we need you to check
the crime blotter column

32:25.814 --> 32:27.147
for July 18th.

32:27.215 --> 32:29.015
Were there any other
arrests made?

32:29.082 --> 32:32.084
Uh, July 18th.
July 18th.

32:32.152 --> 32:34.153
There was a woman, for shoplifting.
She was released.

32:34.221 --> 32:36.122
There were two underage kids
for alcohol possession.

32:36.189 --> 32:37.490
They were picked up
by their parents.

32:37.558 --> 32:39.839
And there was one 22-year-old
male arrested for vandalism.

32:39.894 --> 32:41.427
No, as far as I can tell,
was he released?

32:41.495 --> 32:43.195
He cooled his heels
in jail overnight.

32:43.263 --> 32:44.831
We need his name, Garcia.

32:44.899 --> 32:46.332
It was Tory Chapman.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.334
He got in a lot of trouble with
the law when he was younger,

32:48.402 --> 32:49.601
but then he straightened out.

32:49.669 --> 32:51.137
Hotch: Where is he now?

32:51.204 --> 32:53.772
He lives at 228 Brook Street
in Grangerville.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.509
That's a little town 15 miles
south of Bronson Springs,

32:56.576 --> 32:57.976
and he makes furniture.

32:58.740 --> 33:01.141
FBI!

33:17.690 --> 33:19.690
It's clear here.

33:19.759 --> 33:20.691
JJ: Clear.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.894
Rossi: Clear!

33:38.409 --> 33:39.676
The place is empty.

33:39.744 --> 33:42.179
Someone was interrupted
before they could finish.

33:42.247 --> 33:43.417
He's on the run.

33:43.442 --> 33:45.115
It's a good bet he took
his wife with him.

33:45.116 --> 33:47.951
I'll get an APB out.

33:50.821 --> 33:53.189
What do you got, Rossi?

33:58.128 --> 33:59.561
Sheriff: He married her?

33:59.629 --> 34:01.549
Tory Chapman killed Wade Burke,
then he must have

34:01.564 --> 34:03.032
insinuated himself into
Leanne Tipton's life.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.200
Why?

34:04.268 --> 34:05.634
Leanne must have
presented as a victim

34:05.702 --> 34:07.402
and he saw himself
as a rescuer.

34:07.469 --> 34:09.070
Why did you kill Wendy?

34:09.138 --> 34:11.306
Why?

34:11.373 --> 34:13.775
I'll tell you why.

34:13.842 --> 34:16.110
All this crap about
the time capsule

34:16.179 --> 34:18.813
and showing the future
what a great place

34:18.880 --> 34:22.283
Bronson Springs
is in 1988.

34:22.350 --> 34:24.318
I wanted to give
the folks in the future

34:24.385 --> 34:27.321
a real snapshot,
one that isn't in their stupid

34:27.388 --> 34:29.223
chamber of commerce
booklets.

34:32.159 --> 34:34.094
Please don't do this.

34:34.161 --> 34:36.096
You were done
a terrible wrong.

34:36.164 --> 34:38.563
I am making it right.

34:38.632 --> 34:43.469
Tory, there's something
about that night you don't know.

34:45.739 --> 34:48.808
Leanne Tipton's statement
about the rape--

34:48.876 --> 34:49.876
it's off.

34:49.944 --> 34:51.043
Reid: What do you mean?

34:51.110 --> 34:53.379
Listen to this.
"He took me in the back room

34:53.447 --> 34:54.847
"and I was really,
really scared.

34:54.914 --> 34:58.083
"I didn't know
what was going on, and he--

34:58.151 --> 35:00.118
"he kind of put his hand
on my throat.

35:00.186 --> 35:04.156
"Then he started to,
you know, take my clothes off.

35:04.224 --> 35:06.291
"I just tried to...

35:06.359 --> 35:09.728
And when he was finished,
I ran."

35:09.795 --> 35:11.670
What's off about that?

35:11.695 --> 35:13.164
It sounds like a woman
getting raped.

35:13.165 --> 35:15.799
"Really, really scared"
is overselling.

35:15.868 --> 35:18.535
"Kind of put his hand
on my throat" is underselling.

35:18.603 --> 35:21.472
And she uses the word "just,"
which minimizes what follows,

35:21.539 --> 35:25.942
and down here, um,
"he started to take my clothes off."

35:26.010 --> 35:27.477
And "started to"
typically indicates

35:27.544 --> 35:28.979
that what follows
was interrupted.

35:29.046 --> 35:30.513
This is a false
accusation.

35:30.581 --> 35:31.514
No.

35:31.582 --> 35:33.917
Tory...

35:33.985 --> 35:36.253
You're lying.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.289
You're lying.

35:39.357 --> 35:41.224
I was in love with Wade.

35:41.292 --> 35:43.359
And that night,

35:43.426 --> 35:45.494
we got into a fight.

35:45.561 --> 35:46.561
And he--he...

35:46.629 --> 35:48.830
No, that's not
what happened.

35:48.899 --> 35:52.201
He...He raped you.

35:52.269 --> 35:53.835
He raped you!

35:53.904 --> 35:55.670
My dad would have
beaten me senseless

35:55.738 --> 35:57.406
if he had known about Wade.

35:57.473 --> 36:00.474
I was so scared.

36:00.542 --> 36:03.077
So I--I made up a story.

36:03.145 --> 36:06.114
I'm sorry.

36:06.181 --> 36:09.350
I'm so sorry.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.585
You were
in love with him.

36:11.653 --> 36:14.654
I wish my folks
hadn't taken the money.

36:16.357 --> 36:18.125
You took money?

36:34.541 --> 36:36.642
So what the hell
was going on in here?

36:36.710 --> 36:39.544
Garcia said he made
furniture for a living.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.478
Engraving materials.

36:41.546 --> 36:43.413
Plates, fonts.

36:43.481 --> 36:46.650
Not typical
for standard carpentry.

36:53.657 --> 36:56.760
This is where we did it--
right in here.

36:56.827 --> 36:58.862
Bags went in,
capsule got sealed,

36:58.929 --> 37:01.865
the next morning
we took it outside and buried it.

37:06.737 --> 37:07.804
Aaron...

37:07.872 --> 37:10.038
[Glass breaking]

37:10.106 --> 37:13.008
I think I know
where he's going.

37:13.076 --> 37:14.910
Step up.

37:14.978 --> 37:17.880
What are you doing?

37:19.182 --> 37:23.118
Tory, you're hurting me.

37:33.595 --> 37:35.362
The busts in the display case

37:35.430 --> 37:38.065
are judges, mayors,
civic leaders.

37:38.133 --> 37:40.367
Chapman probably had to walk past
them every time he went to court.

37:40.435 --> 37:43.103
And if he felt that he and
Leanne were given a raw deal...

37:56.383 --> 38:01.386
No, no, no, no,
please, Tory, don't.

38:08.895 --> 38:11.163
Open your eyes.

38:11.231 --> 38:13.597
No.

38:13.665 --> 38:16.767
Open them, or I'll
open them for you.

38:19.404 --> 38:22.140
Oh, God.

38:23.742 --> 38:25.877
I think I'm gonna be sick.

38:25.945 --> 38:29.679
What for? You're looking
at Bronson Springs' finest.

38:29.747 --> 38:31.849
It takes a special kind
of integrity

38:31.916 --> 38:33.884
to earn your way in there.

38:33.952 --> 38:35.385
Tory, please.

38:35.453 --> 38:37.454
It turns out you were worse
than any of them.

38:39.357 --> 38:42.359
Leanne: Please don't.

38:42.426 --> 38:44.627
Please!

38:44.695 --> 38:46.663
Tory, please don't.

38:46.731 --> 38:48.030
Please don't! Please!

38:48.098 --> 38:50.767
Drop the weapon.

38:50.835 --> 38:52.935
Drop it now.

39:02.011 --> 39:03.979
Don't shoot. I'm putting it
down right here.

39:04.046 --> 39:06.348
Do it slowly.

39:16.393 --> 39:18.626
Cutting the heads
off of people?

39:18.694 --> 39:20.461
Only a crazy person
would do that, right?

39:20.529 --> 39:23.631
And crazy people
get released eventually.

39:23.699 --> 39:24.832
I wouldn't
count on that.

39:24.901 --> 39:27.035
It may take 25 years,
but I can do that.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.770
25 years, that's nothing.

39:28.837 --> 39:30.872
