WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.304
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends.

00:03.337 --> 00:04.472
The times, they are a-changing.
First, our Jane.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.174
She was recently dumped.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.442
Plus her book got
mediocre reviews.

00:08.476 --> 00:12.613
And then this happened.
I know! OMG, right?

00:12.646 --> 00:14.048
Another OMG?

00:14.082 --> 00:16.250
Alba said no
to Jorge's proposal.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.551
Oh, and did I mention

00:17.585 --> 00:20.488
Rafael was living
with the Villanuevas now?

00:20.521 --> 00:22.790
See, his sister Luisa
took all his money,

00:22.823 --> 00:25.159
which meant Mateo had to say
good-bye to private school.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.161
Unfortunately,
Jane's local school district

00:27.195 --> 00:28.262
wasn't so great.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.397
But...

00:29.430 --> 00:30.598
Did you know

00:30.631 --> 00:31.965
that your parents live in
the Elbamare School District?

00:31.999 --> 00:35.203
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, yeah,
they decided to send him there.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.104
On the down low.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.072
Also facing
child care challenges,

00:38.106 --> 00:40.774
Jane's father Rogelio.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.543
See, he was married to Xo,

00:42.576 --> 00:43.611
but had a baby with Darci.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.513
Oh, and did I mention,

00:45.546 --> 00:48.482
Darci was dating his archrival
and co

00:48.516 --> 00:50.684
I know! Straight out of
a telenovela, right?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.320
But imagine this.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.721
Petra's twin sister Anezka

00:53.754 --> 00:55.789
convinced Rafael's sister Luisa

00:55.823 --> 00:58.792
that she was hallucinating
some guy named Carl.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.562
So, Luisa checked herself
into a mental institution.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.565
But here's the thing, friends,
Carl was real.

01:04.598 --> 01:08.236
And to add to the crazy,
Anezka started spiraling.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.804
So she faked her own death
to see who really loved her.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.473
And she briefly thought
she could trust Petra.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.275
Until she realized
she couldn't.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.444
And then this happened.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.147
Which, my friends,
is where we left off.

01:20.514 --> 01:24.418
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was ten years old,

01:24.452 --> 01:27.521
the day she had dreamed about
finally came.

01:29.690 --> 01:34.495
The very first kiss
between Teresa and Ramiro

01:34.528 --> 01:35.596
on Las Rutas de Pasión.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.332
JANE: How do they know which way
to move their heads?

01:38.366 --> 01:40.601
Uh, well, they probably
just rehearsed.

01:40.634 --> 01:43.571
No, I mean in real life.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.474
How am I gonna know what to do?

02:01.555 --> 02:03.491
Okay, here's the real deal.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.194
It won't be anything
like Las Rutas de Pasión,

02:06.227 --> 02:07.395
so set your expectations low.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.363
The clouds
aren't gonna part,

02:09.397 --> 02:10.531
angels won't sing,

02:10.564 --> 02:11.932
it'll probably be
a little awkward.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.536
So, what happens?
What do you do?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.205
Well, you just open
your mouth a little,

02:17.238 --> 02:20.374
and your tongue will touch his--
or hers, either way.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.376
My tongue?

02:22.410 --> 02:23.244
Yup.

02:23.277 --> 02:26.414
Do I just leave it there?
You move it,

02:26.447 --> 02:27.281
b-but not too much.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.950
How will I know
if I'm doing a good job?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.553
Trust me, you'll know.

02:32.586 --> 02:36.156
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here. Now.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.298
What... was...

02:44.332 --> 02:45.899
I wasn't planning it,
I-I-I just...

02:45.933 --> 02:47.601
MATEO:
Mommy?

02:47.635 --> 02:49.770
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, no, did he see?

02:49.803 --> 02:51.505
I'm scared to go
to kindergarten.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.476
Oh, sweetheart.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.944
Oh, my-- ah.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.579
It's gonna be
so much fun.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.548
But I don't have any friends.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.582
You'll meet some kids

03:01.615 --> 03:04.485
when we go to registration
tomorrow. Now, come on.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.519
You need some sleep.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.988
Mommy will lie
with you. Hmm?

03:13.361 --> 03:15.729
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR :
Well, he sure looks happy.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.401
And she looks...

03:20.434 --> 03:21.669
She looks...

03:25.706 --> 03:27.575
I'm sorry, friends,

03:27.608 --> 03:30.878
but I actually don't know
what the hell she's thinking.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.596
Back to reality.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.031
Hi, Petra.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.033
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.635
I know your sister's dead.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.537
No, she wasn't
really dead before.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.638
That-- she faked her death

03:57.671 --> 03:59.707
because she was trying
to figure out who loved her.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.742
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Reality,
of course, being relative.

04:01.775 --> 04:02.743
So she's alive?

04:02.776 --> 04:03.877
No.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.847
I found out, she attacked me,
so I defended myself,

04:06.880 --> 04:08.582
and she fell off the balcony.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.518
So now she's actually dead.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.286
Oh, my God. That's...

04:12.320 --> 04:13.754
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Straight out of a telenovela!

04:13.787 --> 04:14.722
Self-defense.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.757
So, listen, I need you
to watch the girls.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.459
The nanny can't stay overnight,

04:18.492 --> 04:19.460
I'm stuck
at the police station.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.461
I'm going now.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.529
Are you okay?

04:21.562 --> 04:23.664
Do you have a lawyer?

04:23.697 --> 04:24.865
No, I don't need one.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.500
Like I said,
it was self-defense.

04:26.534 --> 04:29.537
Yeah, I knew a lot of guys
in prison who said that, too.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.339
Just get a lawyer, a good one.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.540
I have to go.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.676
That's my other line.
We'll talk later.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.345
What the hell
took so long, Krishna?

04:37.378 --> 04:39.947
Well, it's a long drive,
and I had to stop for gas,

04:39.980 --> 04:41.582
and then my debit card wasn't...
Stop.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.583
I don't actually care.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.551
Are you at the mental hospital?

04:43.584 --> 04:45.786
They prefer you call it
a "wellness center."

04:45.819 --> 04:46.720
Krishna!

04:46.754 --> 04:50.824
Sorry. Yes.
I'm here, but Luisa's gone.

04:50.858 --> 04:51.859
What?

04:51.892 --> 04:52.760
She checked herself out,

04:52.793 --> 04:53.694
and she didn't leave
any contact info.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.597
Oh, no.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.666
Once I tell Luisa
that you and mother gaslit her,

04:58.699 --> 05:01.034
she's going to get out and sign
all her shares over to Rafael.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.870
I told her you and Rafael

05:02.903 --> 05:04.938
were the ones
who had been sending Carl

05:04.972 --> 05:06.440
and lighting her gas.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.240
And she seemed

05:07.274 --> 05:10.878
very, very angry
with her brother.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.581
Listen to me, get a P.I., okay?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.483
We need to find Luisa.

05:15.516 --> 05:19.553
Oh, and-and, oh,
get me a lawyer, a good one.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.357
DARCI:
What's wrong?

05:23.391 --> 05:25.593
What's wrong is that this
is my time with Baby,

05:25.626 --> 05:26.927
and you're sitting here...
milking.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.795
Pumping.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.063
And unfortunately,
you fed her early

05:30.097 --> 05:31.599
and got her off
her schedule.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.901
So if I don't pump,
these babies will blow.

05:33.934 --> 05:37.371
ESTEBAN:
Darci produces so much milk.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.907
She's overflowing.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.644
Like a goddess of... milk.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.912
DARCI:
Well, this goddess

05:44.945 --> 05:46.814
doesn't need another
clogged duct.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.016
Okay, get this
in the fridge,

05:49.049 --> 05:50.017
it's liquid gold.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.552
Come on, Moosh,
let's go.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.686
:
Ask her.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.821
ROGELIO:
Darci.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.822
I was thinking,

05:54.855 --> 05:57.625
maybe Baby could stay overnight
this weekend?

05:57.658 --> 05:59.527
Overnight? No way.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.094
Overnights don't happen
until she's a year old,

06:01.128 --> 06:03.631
per our contract.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.898
Now, give Baby to Esteban.

06:13.641 --> 06:16.477
See you on set, Rogelio.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.782
Bright side?
Our really difficult

06:21.815 --> 06:24.652
new family dynamic is something
we can talk about in therapy.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.086
I don't need to talk about that
with a therapist.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.555
I just need Esteban

06:27.588 --> 06:30.791
to get a D-list,
straight-to-Crackle film

06:30.824 --> 06:32.059
that shoots in Guadalajara.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.628
But like I said,

06:34.662 --> 06:36.664
I'll be happy
to accompany you to therapy

06:36.697 --> 06:38.632
to help you learn
about yourself.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.568
Okay, terrific.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.572
Are you sure?

06:44.605 --> 06:45.639
Because the last time
I talked to you,

06:45.673 --> 06:47.808
you wanted to marry Jorge.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.662
Yeah, it's a great feeling.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.764
I didn't hear
you come in.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.500
So how's Mateo?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.201
Really nervous.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.035
How are you?

07:15.068 --> 07:18.806
Maybe we should talk
about us later.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.708
I meant about Mateo.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.576
And that lying
about the address thing.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.177
Oh.  Sorry.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.746
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To remind you,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.715
they'd enrolled
in a great public kindergarten

07:27.748 --> 07:29.583
using Ro and Xo's address.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.151
I'm prepared, obviously.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.220
This is the place where we'd get
coffee every morning

07:33.253 --> 07:35.088
if we did, in fact,
live in the area.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.190
And I'm going
to run to my mom's

07:37.224 --> 07:39.860
and drop off toys in case
school officials ever come by.

07:39.893 --> 07:40.761
You dropped off toys
last week

07:40.794 --> 07:42.830
when you set up a room
for Mateo upstairs.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.998
I know, pay attention,
that's just what I told Rafael.

07:45.032 --> 07:45.999
Why?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.768
Because...

07:47.801 --> 07:49.537
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Come on, say it already!

07:49.570 --> 07:51.004
Last night...

07:51.038 --> 07:53.206
he kissed me.
What?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.542
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know!

07:54.575 --> 07:55.475
Completely out of
the blue.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.877
Well, not completely.
Couple months ago,

07:56.910 --> 07:58.746
you tried to get
in the shower with him.

07:58.779 --> 07:59.747
Exactly.

07:59.780 --> 08:00.948
Months ago.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.883
I mean, we're in
a different place now.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.720
Come on.
How was the kiss?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.557
I kissed Jane last night.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.192
And, Alba, it was...

08:12.225 --> 08:14.695
Not good.
What?

08:14.728 --> 08:15.829
I don't understand.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.531
You've had great kisses
before with him.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.567
I know. Next level.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.835
And I tried, honestly,
I gave it my all.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.804
I don't know,

08:23.837 --> 08:24.872
it-it just felt...

08:24.905 --> 08:27.007
Exactly the same.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.743
...completely different.
And the timing?

08:29.777 --> 08:32.713
I just had my heart broken.
What was he even thinking?

08:32.746 --> 08:36.584
And all I could think was,
"Finally. Finally."

08:36.617 --> 08:40.053
It felt like coming home.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.589
I don't even want to go home.

08:41.622 --> 08:42.956
You have to.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.826
I know, I know.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.829
I'll just...

08:48.862 --> 08:50.297
nip this whole thing in the bud.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.933
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey, that actually works.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.715
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes. Where were we?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.182
You look like you need
a big kiss.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.886
Ah... mwah.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.087
You're gonna love kindergarten.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.756
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Debatable.
Now.

09:15.789 --> 09:16.957
One last time,
what is your name?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.793
Mateo Gloriano Rogelio
Solano Villanueva.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.794
Good.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.963
And what's your address?

09:22.996 --> 09:25.899
1312 Mockingbird Terrace.

09:25.933 --> 09:26.734
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To be clear,

09:26.767 --> 09:29.036
that was Xo and Ro's address.
Perfect.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.938
And we need that
last piece of mail.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.006
Here it is.
Thank you so much.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.908
So many people try
to get into this district,

09:34.942 --> 09:36.309
we need to be really careful.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.846
Only our taxpayers.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.654
RAFAEL:
Jane.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.661
JANE :
I can't believe

09:53.694 --> 09:55.996
he's starting
kindergarten.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.397
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.167
I remember when he was just
a syringe on a tray,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.035
waiting to be inserted
into the wrong woman.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.137
I know.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.776
Oh, you okay?
No.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.677
But I told myself

10:09.710 --> 10:11.111
I can't get emotional
until tomorrow.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.312
It's just registration.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.015
Kindergarten
is a big deal.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.250
Come on.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.853
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait. Is this a normal hug?

10:19.887 --> 10:21.789
Or is it weird
because of the kiss?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.160
Okay, I got to go
pick up the twins.
Mm-hmm.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.296
Uh, I will see you at home,
and we'll talk

10:29.329 --> 10:31.732
about... last night?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.867
Yes, good.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.870
Actually, maybe kiss first
and then talk.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.338
I'm sorry, I know we have
a lot to discuss,

10:38.371 --> 10:40.974
but, uh...

10:41.008 --> 10:42.810
...that was some kiss, huh?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.277
Yes, it-it was.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.814
XIOMARA:
I was shocked

10:46.847 --> 10:48.816
that any part of Rogelio,
no matter how small,

10:48.849 --> 10:50.150
suspected I was pregnant

10:50.183 --> 10:51.885
all those years ago.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.887
And I want to be able
to let go of it.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.189
Rogelio, how do you feel
about what Xiomara said?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.391
Hmm?

10:58.425 --> 11:03.230
Oh, well, um, I agree
on-on some level.

11:03.263 --> 11:07.701
But on another
level, I don't.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.939
You weren't
even listening.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.174
Of course I was.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.109
You've
been tweeting?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.078
No!

11:18.111 --> 11:20.113
Just one little tweet.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.059
I don't believe this.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.761
I am expected to
constantly tweet.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.329
I'm a tastemaker,
a 280 ambassador.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.265
But you know how important
this is to me.
You have no idea

11:38.298 --> 11:39.933
what an honor it was
And I don't need to hear

11:39.967 --> 11:41.969
to get 280 early.
any more about how
you got 280 early.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.136
It's important to me!

11:43.170 --> 11:44.237
Okay, okay.
XIOMARA:
Oh, my God.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.039
I'm gonna break that phone.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.108
I would like to see
you try.
Rogelio.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.443
Why are you reluctant
to discuss the past?

11:50.477 --> 11:53.246
Because he used
to be a Scientologist,

11:53.280 --> 11:54.848
so he doesn't
believe in therapy.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.817
That is not true.
Leah Remini and I

11:56.850 --> 11:58.418
totally changed our
minds about that.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.520
It's because we already
talked about what happened.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.322
THERAPIST:
So, l-let's not talk

12:02.355 --> 12:04.257
about your past with Xiomara.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.059
Let's talk
about your deeper past.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.495
Oftentimes, by understanding
the relationship

12:08.528 --> 12:11.098
with the formative female
in your life, your mother,

12:11.131 --> 12:13.767
it can help you understand
your relationship

12:13.801 --> 12:15.268
with the women
in your life now.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.137
My mother is an incredible
woman; she's perfect.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.172
She's strong, caring,

12:19.206 --> 12:22.075
kind, an amazing momager.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.543
Wait, what's a momager?

12:23.576 --> 12:26.213
My mother was my manager
as a child.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.248
So, when you say your line,

12:28.281 --> 12:34.287
show them your beautiful soul
and your beautiful teeth.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.223
THERAPIST: Having a business
relationship with the woman

12:36.256 --> 12:39.059
who's supposed to be loving you
unconditionally.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.561
All that pressure
and responsibility

12:41.594 --> 12:44.464
on such a little boy's
shoulders.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.299
How did that
make you feel?

12:46.333 --> 12:48.401
Well...

12:48.435 --> 12:52.439
yeah, it could sometimes
be hard.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.544
I mean, I had to support
my whole family.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.146
If I failed,

12:59.179 --> 13:02.983
my whole family
would suffer,

13:03.016 --> 13:05.886
which is just a lot

13:05.919 --> 13:09.156
f-for a little kid to handle.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.457
PETRA:
Oh, please, spare me.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.092
You did this to
get under my skin.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.260
I didn't.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.928
She came
highly recommended.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.029
Her name just
happened to be...

13:16.063 --> 13:18.832
Jane.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.367
And you are Petra?
Yes.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.935
And I really don't
need a lawyer.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.875
Then why am I here?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.943
My children's father felt
I should hire someone.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.279
Because you were the only person
at the scene of the murder?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.381
There was no murder.
It was self-defense.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.184
Not sure the D.A. would
agree with you on that.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.186
I made some calls to see if
there were any charges pending.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.521
What... are there?

13:41.554 --> 13:44.124
No. Not yet.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.193
But 50-50 we're going
to get there.

13:46.226 --> 13:50.197
And unfortunately you're not
the most sympathetic defendant.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.299
And this isn't your first time
being a person of interest

13:52.332 --> 13:53.600
in a murder investigation.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.537
Oh.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.206
Got it.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.608
And just to be clear,

14:01.641 --> 14:03.376
I know what this is about.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.612
Well, you see
my expensive shoes,

14:05.645 --> 14:07.580
you know my hotel
is worth millions,

14:07.614 --> 14:09.282
so you're trying to
make it seem like this

14:09.316 --> 14:11.018
is some complicated case
that's going to require

14:11.051 --> 14:12.652
hundreds of billable hours.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.656
But let me be clear:
this is not complicated.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.326
My sister attacked me.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.262
We struggled, she fell.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.032
Now let me be clear.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.000
Here's what's
going to happen.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.368
First, the police are
going to get a subpoena

14:28.401 --> 14:30.437
for your e-mails
and phone records.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.305
Then they'll go after
the hotel security footage.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.042
After that, they'll ask
for the reservation records,

14:35.075 --> 14:37.144
so they can interrogate
all the guests

14:37.177 --> 14:38.445
and all of your
hotel employees,

14:38.478 --> 14:41.614
so you may want to put
your shoe shopping on hold

14:41.648 --> 14:43.216
because it is going
to cost you a lot of money

14:43.250 --> 14:44.351
to get out of this.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.986
And you'll pay it
to someone else

14:46.019 --> 14:49.456
because I'm not interested.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.930
Krishna!

14:56.964 --> 14:59.432
Find me another
lawyer not named...

14:59.466 --> 15:01.101
RAFAEL:
Jane.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.269
Is Mateo asleep?

15:02.302 --> 15:04.337
Finally.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.307
So, should we talk?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.442
Uh, yeah. Great.

15:12.145 --> 15:16.416
But first
let me make my pitch.

15:16.449 --> 15:21.188
And before you say no,
here's a list

15:21.221 --> 15:23.023
of all the reasons
it won't work out,

15:23.056 --> 15:26.359
practically,
with my counterarguments.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.461
Come on, you like lists.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.398
Number one.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.433
We just got back
to being friends.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.336
And under that is
my counterargument,

15:36.369 --> 15:40.273
which is really just me
apologizing for being a jerk.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.574
And-and talking

15:41.608 --> 15:45.045
about how much
your friendship means.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.314
And how much I missed you.

15:47.347 --> 15:51.018
And how co-parenting has
to be our top priority.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.320
That's the thing, Mateo...

15:53.353 --> 15:55.455
Yeah, that's in section two.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.225
A list about how it would
ultimately benefit him

15:58.258 --> 15:59.592
if we worked out.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.130
"If"?
Just continue reading.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.664
We take it slow.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.334
Not much would change and
we're already living together.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.568
So we just treat it like
any other new relationship

16:08.601 --> 16:11.438
and-and we don't tell him
for a while.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.640
Why not try?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.779
I just had my heart broken.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.314
I know.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.749
And there's a section
about timing.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.385
And how I know
it's not perfect.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.054
Come on, you don't have
an incredible kiss like that

16:27.087 --> 16:28.255
if there's not
something there.

16:33.426 --> 16:37.164
Honestly...

16:37.197 --> 16:39.766
it wasn't incredible for me.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.800
What?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.435
The kiss.

16:42.469 --> 16:46.139
It was kind of like...

16:46.173 --> 16:48.575
I don't know, not great.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.577
Yeah, I-I don't understand.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.744
What don't you understand?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.313
It was a great kiss.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.181
I mean, I'm a good kisser.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.648
This isn't an indictment
of your kissing.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.118
I'm just saying that
I wasn't feeling it.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.353
You know? Maybe
things changed.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.355
Or maybe your head
wasn't in the game.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.756
What?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.259
Well, you were just
caught off guard

17:06.293 --> 17:08.495
and all you could think about
was all that other stuff.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.364
You can't understand that
somebody didn't
Look, I told
your grandmother

17:11.398 --> 17:12.732
like your "magical kiss"?
it was the greatest
kiss of my life.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.401
You spoke to my
abuela about this?

17:14.434 --> 17:15.202
She's my friend.
I like her.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.271
Well, then maybe
you should kiss her.

17:27.514 --> 17:32.252
Five more minutes,
Mr. Sweetface.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.821
Hey, hi.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.256
You okay?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.258
Are you super sad about
Jorge or anything?

17:39.759 --> 17:42.162
Okay, because I'm
angry with you.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.064
But I don't want to get into
a fight if you're super sad.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.270
Stop talking to Rafael about me.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.473
You're supposed
to be on my team.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.349
There is no Team Jafael.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.151
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yikes, sorry.

18:05.552 --> 18:08.321
Where is this coming from?

18:14.527 --> 18:17.364
An accident which we made
the absolute best of.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.137
Hmm?

18:29.809 --> 18:30.877
Huh?

18:34.547 --> 18:35.615
In therapy.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.653
My grandson is starting
kindergarten.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.357
I'm hiding from your father.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.825
All he wants to do

18:45.858 --> 18:47.460
is talk about his childhood

18:47.494 --> 18:49.629
and his feelings
and his realizations

18:49.662 --> 18:51.464
and his realizations about
his childhood feelings

18:51.498 --> 18:55.202
and his feelings about
his childhood realizations.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.206
Now we can't get through
a five-minute conversation

18:59.239 --> 19:00.540
without him crying
about his mother.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.845
Hey!

19:05.878 --> 19:07.547
All right, who's ready
for the first day

19:07.580 --> 19:09.416
of kindergarten, huh?

19:09.449 --> 19:10.550
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, memories.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.785
No!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.454
Go. You got to
let Mommy go.
Oh, geez. I can't watch this.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.425
Please, no more crying.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.859
Honestly, I thought this
would be good news.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.529
It is.
I'm weeping with happiness.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.397
Thank you so much.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.600
A telenovela sequel,
it's beautiful.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.469
Tell me a little bit
about the idea.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.871
You'll drink
a lady scientist's potion

19:31.904 --> 19:32.972
and kiss her as planned,

19:33.005 --> 19:35.242
then, bam!

19:35.275 --> 19:38.411
You start to grow big
because you drank too much.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.314
Brilliant, sexy, I love it.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.782
Does Esteban know
I'm getting a sequel?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.484
Yes, he was told this morning.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.785
Beautiful, perfect.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.420
Is he devastated?

19:47.454 --> 19:49.422
Can I squash him like a bug
at the end?

19:49.456 --> 19:50.423
Rogelio.

19:50.457 --> 19:51.758
Yes.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.327
You are right.
Why can't I just accept

19:54.361 --> 19:55.495
my own happiness?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.699
It must have to do
with my mother, who...

20:01.468 --> 20:02.669
Well, never mind.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.003
I'll talk about her in therapy.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.638
But thank you,
thank you so much.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.807
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Speaking of two people
who could use some therapy...

20:09.309 --> 20:10.943
Hope he made friends.
Yeah, me, too.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.480
Hey, I'm sorry
about last night.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.515
No, I'm sorry.
I feel so bad.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.550
Me, too, me, too.
I can't stop
thinking about it.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.785
I'm so sorry I caught you
off guard like that.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.620
You still think
that's the reason?

20:20.653 --> 20:23.390
Hey, let's just leave it.
Do you?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.525
Okay, you are a planner.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.494
At least admit
it's a possibility.
Admit it's a possibility

20:27.527 --> 20:28.928
that you aren't quite the
kisser you think you are.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.631
I was put at a kissing booth
in college, all right?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.466
People paid to kiss me.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.868
Well, I wouldn't have paid.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.770
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to let this go?

20:37.804 --> 20:38.838
Done. I've let go.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.607
MATEO:
Mommy, Daddy!

20:41.808 --> 20:42.842
How was school?

20:42.875 --> 20:45.545
School was fun, I made friends.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.546
Can I have a playdate?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.315
Of course you can.
Well...

20:48.348 --> 20:49.416
Yay, yay, yay!

20:49.449 --> 20:50.883
Elijah!
My dad says

20:50.917 --> 20:53.620
you can come to our
house right now.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.787
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Their house?

20:54.821 --> 20:56.389
You mean Xo and Ro's house.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.790
I, uh, I wasn't...

20:57.824 --> 20:59.392
I didn't think...
Exactly.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.993
I'll handle this.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.061
JANE:
A playdate sounds fun.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.463
At your place?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.064
Ooh, actually,
we were hoping yours.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.333
We're undergoing renovations,

21:06.366 --> 21:08.034
and the house
is really a mess.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.337
Or what about, um, Grafton Park?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.939
'Cause it's so nice to get
the kids outside, playing...

21:12.972 --> 21:14.307
Oh, I wish.
Elijah has allergies.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.076
Could we come to your place?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.045
Why not?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.079
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Because you don't live there.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.881
Uh, they will follow me home,

21:21.914 --> 21:23.950
and we'll meet you there.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.585
Okay, great.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.723
Now, Mateo,
where did you put that thermos?

21:31.891 --> 21:33.526
XIOMARA:
I'm hurrying.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.395
Where are you?
RAFAEL:
I'm here.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.463
What do you
want me to do

21:36.496 --> 21:37.730
with this picture?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.699
Just put it in your car.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.300
How long do we have?
Wh

21:48.908 --> 21:51.478
I'm so sorry,
my tank is below empty.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.745
Just give me one minute.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.736
Okay, so, Mateo.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.772
We are gonna play a really
fun game this afternoon.

22:19.806 --> 22:24.544
It's called: Pretend That We
Live at Papa and Abuela's House.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.712
Why are we playing it?

22:25.745 --> 22:27.380
It's a long story.

22:27.414 --> 22:28.781
And did I mention

22:28.815 --> 22:31.684
that there's a great
prize if you win?

22:31.718 --> 22:34.554
What do I get?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A great public education.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.955
Ice cream sundae.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.390
Chocolate syrup?

22:37.424 --> 22:39.392
:
And rainbow sprinkles.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.127
MATEO:
Deal.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.895
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here.
Hey.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.697
Welcome. Come in.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.132
MATEO:
I live here.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.668
Mateo is so excited
to have Elijah over.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.969
Because I live here.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.638
Uh, that's right, you do, Mateo.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.773
Please come in.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.015
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, the playdate.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.184
Be careful or the whole thing
will come crashing down.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.919
Thanks for the reminder, Mateo.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.692
You sure do have a lot of
breastmilk in your fridge.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.962
Ah, yes, that would be
Darci's liquid gold.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.897
Sorry. I know
lots of moms breastfeed

23:17.930 --> 23:19.699
for an extended time nowadays.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.067
I-I hope that
didn't sound judgmental.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.602
No problem, bud.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.803
I am one of those moms.

23:23.836 --> 23:24.471
You know, what can I say?

23:24.504 --> 23:26.105
Mateo's healthy as a horse.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.741
Can I see your room?
Uh... Of-of course.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.510
Mateo, why don't we, uh,
take your friend upstairs?

23:30.543 --> 23:32.979
Can I have a drink first, Mommy?

23:33.012 --> 23:34.781
Oh, I'm just gonna go
with water this time.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.952
Interesting photos you've
got in the restroom.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.689
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oops, let me show you
what she's referring to.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.891
Actually, it's a triptych.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.495
Who are those people?

23:48.528 --> 23:49.929
Yeah, actually,
those are my parents.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.798
You have naked photos
of your parents?

23:51.831 --> 23:53.165
That's right.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.867
We are a body-positive,

23:54.901 --> 23:56.869
extended breastfeeding

23:56.903 --> 23:58.505
hippy-dippy household
up in here.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.740
I can't take it. I feel like

24:00.773 --> 24:03.510
they are going to be busted
any minute. Which reminds me.

24:03.543 --> 24:06.546
LAWYER: Of course there won't
be a murder charge.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.080
This whole thing will blow over.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.249
Clearly, that other lawyer
was just trying to scare you.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.484
Thank you. That's what I...

24:11.518 --> 24:12.519
MAN:
Petra Solano?

24:13.219 --> 24:15.722
Yes, that's me.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.758
This is a subpoena for
your e-mails and phone records.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.192
We also need
to review

24:20.226 --> 24:21.928
all security footage
and get a complete list

24:21.961 --> 24:23.563
of guests
who were staying at the hotel

24:23.596 --> 24:25.932
the night
your sister died.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.199
Of course.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.601
I have nothing to hide.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.074
Call Jane Ramos.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.743
Now. Tell her
I don't care what it costs.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.679
I'm just realizing the cost now.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.982
How she had me sing and dance
for the entire waitstaff

24:43.015 --> 24:44.684
because one of the busboys
recognized me

24:44.717 --> 24:47.920
from a cereal commercial.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.989
It was my birthday,
they should have been singing

24:50.022 --> 24:52.992
to me.
You know what?

24:53.025 --> 24:55.795
I-I was hoping

24:55.828 --> 24:57.764
that we could enjoy a
nice afternoon together

24:57.797 --> 25:01.133
and maybe not talk about your
childhood for a few hours?

25:01.167 --> 25:04.103
It's been kind of nonstop.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.105
Oh, well, excuse me

25:06.138 --> 25:10.109
for having feelings and being
in touch with my emotions.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.178
Maybe the problem is that
I'm touching a nerve here.

25:12.211 --> 25:15.247
I've talked all about my past,
and you haven't shared a thing.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.283
Well, I haven't shared anything
because you haven't let me

25:17.316 --> 25:18.317
get a word in.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.920
Okay. Get a word in.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.889
Talk about your parents.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.291
Well, uh...

25:25.324 --> 25:28.561
there really isn't much to tell.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.329
You know everything.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.265
My relationship with my mom
was complicated,

25:33.299 --> 25:36.869
and my relationship with my dad
was perfect.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.204
Nobody's perfect.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.806
Okay, well, yes, of course,

25:39.839 --> 25:41.874
he wasn't perfect, but...

25:43.309 --> 25:45.177
...he was a wonderful dad.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.180
I don't know if I
ever told you this,

25:48.214 --> 25:52.985
but one Christmas he
worked six extra shifts

25:53.019 --> 25:56.122
just to get me a
Madame Alexander doll.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.692
A-And how did that
make you feel?

26:02.228 --> 26:04.296
Special.

26:04.330 --> 26:09.001
I mean, I was so touched
that he would do that for me.

26:09.035 --> 26:12.004
I loved that doll.

26:13.405 --> 26:17.844
Although, I-I guess,
when I really think about it,

26:17.877 --> 26:20.847
I would have traded
that doll in a second

26:20.880 --> 26:24.150
for more time
with him.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.685
:
This is so stupid.

26:25.718 --> 26:29.055
I don't know why I'm
crying about this.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.692
It's called a breakthrough.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.060
CELESTE:
Elijah, don't break that.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.762
DANA:
Sorry, he's not used

26:35.795 --> 26:37.664
to such nice tableware.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.033
Part of our parenting
philosophy.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.002
Uh, treat kids
like little grownups,

26:43.035 --> 26:44.203
and they'll act
accordingly.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.838
Elijah, look, I have a booger.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.006
Oh.
Oh.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.308
Well, this has been fun,

26:49.341 --> 26:52.044
but we should really get going.
Go put on your shoes, Elijah.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.885
So, you guys obviously
don't live here.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.720
DANA:
It's okay.

27:00.753 --> 27:01.721
We get it.

27:01.754 --> 27:02.955
We just want Mateo to go

27:02.989 --> 27:04.757
to the best school.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.860
Of course. We won't tell anyone,
but you should be careful.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.261
Some parents are narcs.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.963
RAFAEL:
Thank you

27:10.997 --> 27:12.098
for understanding.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.133
And we are so sorry for lying.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.367
We understand.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.003
Really, and...

27:17.036 --> 27:18.705
the boys are buddies now,
so maybe

27:18.738 --> 27:20.439
we can go
to your real house next time?

27:20.472 --> 27:22.274
That would be great.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.876
And whoever the porn stars are
that live here,

27:23.910 --> 27:25.244
they can have their place back.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.715
Totally.
For sure.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.923
Can I have my sundae now
since I lied so good?

27:39.926 --> 27:43.295
Mateo, you weren't lying, we
were playing a game, remember?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.197
A lying game.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.834
Next time Elijah comes over,
do we lie again?

27:54.340 --> 27:55.742
JANE:
So, Mateo, you were right.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.143
We did ask you to lie.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.046
How come?
I thought lying was wrong.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.380
It is.

28:01.413 --> 28:02.782
Most of the time.

28:02.815 --> 28:06.385
But other times,
we make a choice,

28:06.418 --> 28:09.756
and we weigh the cost of the lie
with the benefit of the lie.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.758
I don't understand.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.898
We're pretending to live
at Papa and Abuela's house

28:18.931 --> 28:20.867
so you're allowed to go
to your new school.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.802
RAFAEL: You see,
the school in our neighborhood

28:22.835 --> 28:23.870
isn't very good.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.404
Which isn't fair,

28:25.437 --> 28:27.373
but it's also life.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.909
So we're trying,
in just this one case,

28:29.942 --> 28:31.911
to make things
a little more fair.

28:31.944 --> 28:35.081
And in order to do that,
we pretend to live here.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.816
Well, what if I get mixed up?

28:36.849 --> 28:38.350
Or I forget?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.920
Hey.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.855
Buddy,
you can do this.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.323
You're a big boy.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.859
I'm scared.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.962
They're probably not even
gonna ask, Mr. Sweetface.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.170
Oh, yeah.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.172
And I actually had
my own breakthrough.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.507
Oh.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.510
About Dad and the Madame
Alexander doll he got me

29:04.543 --> 29:07.046
and how much I missed him.

29:09.982 --> 29:13.886
Yeah, but, I mean,
I missed him when he was alive.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.754
H-He was gone so much.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.225
I know, but...

29:26.899 --> 29:28.534
Wha...?

29:32.872 --> 29:36.275
Uh, but, Mom, of course
I was so grateful to him.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.844
But thinking back,

29:37.877 --> 29:40.512
what I wanted more than the doll

29:40.546 --> 29:42.014
was time with him.

29:47.854 --> 29:48.554
It's not a criticism,
I'm just...

29:53.025 --> 29:54.526
Oh, wha...

29:58.931 --> 30:00.967
XIOMARA:
She was so pissed.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.869
She just shut down.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.837
Clearly, she has
underlying issues

30:04.871 --> 30:07.573
from her own dysfunctional
relationship with her parents.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.475
What were they like?

30:09.508 --> 30:12.178
Well, they weren't exactly
her favorite topic.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.380
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, that night,

30:14.413 --> 30:16.182
our porn stars talked.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.417
And I think I was scared
of what my mother would say

30:18.450 --> 30:20.319
if she knew about
your pregnancy.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.254
And that's another reason
I didn't reach out to you.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.190
And talked.

30:24.223 --> 30:27.059
I think that's why my reaction
was so big when you told me.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.095
On some level, all these years

30:29.128 --> 30:30.496
I've been projecting my anger

30:30.529 --> 30:32.198
at my absentee dad on you.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.866
And talked.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.003
That's probably why
I'm such a good actor.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.237
And talked.

30:38.270 --> 30:41.073
Ooh.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.909
I'm a little tipsy.

30:42.942 --> 30:46.212
Forget Drunk History...

30:46.245 --> 30:48.948
Stain all the
carpets you want,

30:48.981 --> 30:51.583
I love you so much,
Xiomara.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.453
I love you so much, too.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.960
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, that night

31:00.993 --> 31:04.263
was the most romantic night
of their lives.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.465
They even made
another triptych.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.335
Not that one, obviously.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.105
How's Mateo?

31:13.139 --> 31:14.907
Um, he's asleep.

31:14.941 --> 31:17.176
Good.
How'd he seem?

31:17.209 --> 31:21.013
Not as scared, but he definitely
has more questions.

31:26.085 --> 31:30.156
Oh, I forgot my...

31:30.189 --> 31:32.058
brush.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.394
I couldn't sleep.

32:08.427 --> 32:12.264
Yeah, me either.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.600
I don't think I realized
what it would feel like.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.168
Having to explain to a kid

32:16.202 --> 32:19.738
all these different
levels and layers to lying?

32:19.771 --> 32:22.174
Yeah.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.342
It's hard.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.744
And there's a lot
at stake.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.279
And we have to be
on the same page

32:27.313 --> 32:30.582
and focus on co-parenting.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.319
I agree.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.154
That's why
I'm moving out.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.290
I'm gonna move in
with Petra.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.592
Just until Luisa's better
and we sort things out.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.994
You don't have to move out.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.295
I do.

32:43.329 --> 32:47.066
Because if I'm being honest,

32:47.099 --> 32:49.501
part of the reason
I was staying was for you.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.671
You asked me if I'll
be able to let go,

32:52.704 --> 32:55.107
and I said yes.

32:55.141 --> 32:58.010
And I will,
but it's gonna be hard

32:58.044 --> 33:01.313
because it means letting go
of something pretty big--

33:01.347 --> 33:03.615
the possibility of us.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.018
Which has been there for me
in the back of my mind

33:06.052 --> 33:07.786
for a long time.

33:07.819 --> 33:12.391
And I just don't think
I can let that go

33:12.424 --> 33:14.293
living here with you.

33:17.396 --> 33:22.134
Me, too, but...
this is best.

33:22.168 --> 33:25.304
It's just hard to...

33:25.337 --> 33:28.207
give up the idea
that something perfect

33:28.240 --> 33:30.676
might not have been
perfect for everyone.

33:34.780 --> 33:39.285
That was about you and Xo.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.820
I heard you last night.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.623
You had one experience,
and she had another.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.126
Which may or may not
have been

33:47.159 --> 33:50.062
similar to what happened
with me and...

33:50.096 --> 33:52.564
she who will not be named.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.435
Rafael Solano?
That's me.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.237
Thanks.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.445
It's from my sister.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.247
This is my third message.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.515
Please have Ms. Ramos
call me back.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.351
You scared me.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.487
Let me know
what you think.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.157
Go ahead, read it.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.727
"Dear Rafael,

34:21.760 --> 34:23.595
"It's been a week.
Finally I feel ready

34:23.629 --> 34:26.232
to write to you and tell you
what I think of what you did."

34:26.265 --> 34:28.200
Keep going.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.669
"I know now that Carl was real.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.572
"Anezka told me.
She told me everything--

34:33.605 --> 34:36.375
how you set me up to get your
inheritance back"

34:36.408 --> 34:39.245
Stop lying.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.680
I just went to the hospital,
and guess what.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.282
After Luisa checked herself out,

34:43.315 --> 34:44.450
a woman named Krishna showed up

34:44.483 --> 34:45.684
asking all kinds of questions.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.719
Even tried to bribe the staff

34:47.753 --> 34:49.721
for information
on Luisa's whereabouts.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.723
Krishna?
Well, she's fired, obviously.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.125
Stop, just stop!

34:53.159 --> 34:55.727
Tell me the truth.

35:05.304 --> 35:09.775
My mother and sister
set everyone up.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.778
They hired Carl to make Luisa
think she was crazy.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.447
I sent Krishna
to find Luisa

35:15.481 --> 35:17.183
as soon as I knew
Anezka said you did it.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.251
How long did you know
Carl was real?

35:19.285 --> 35:22.154
I was going to tell
you and Luisa

35:22.188 --> 35:23.255
just as soon as I dealt with
my mother and Anezka.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.690
How long, Petra?

35:24.723 --> 35:26.792
How long did you leave
my sister in an institution

35:26.825 --> 35:29.228
knowing she wasn't
hallucinating?

35:29.261 --> 35:31.430
A week.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.645
I can't believe Petra
didn't tell you.

35:46.678 --> 35:47.746
I know.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.882
And I need to be
done with that.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.318
With all the lying.

35:52.351 --> 35:55.221
Which is why I don't
want Mateo lying

35:55.254 --> 35:56.655
about his school.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.824
What? No, that
isn't fair.
Okay.
Okay, hold on...

35:58.857 --> 36:01.193
Now, we made this decision, and
I get that you're suddenly...
Hold on.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.562
So I found
a studio apartment

36:03.595 --> 36:04.796
in your parents'
school district,

36:04.830 --> 36:06.465
and I just signed the lease.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.667
What?

36:08.700 --> 36:11.703
Sold my car.
Paid through the ear.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.205
Oh...

36:13.239 --> 36:17.309
I'll take the bus to work
or... carpool with you?

36:17.343 --> 36:20.412
You can totally
carpool with me.

36:20.446 --> 36:21.980
You got an apartment?

36:22.013 --> 36:24.950
Don't get too excited,
it's super small.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.918
I didn't even know
they made them that small.

36:26.952 --> 36:32.591
It sounds... amazing.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.293
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of amazing...

36:37.929 --> 36:40.499
And cut. Moving on
to the last setup.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.268
Give me Baby.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.403
I want time with her
while they light.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.308
ALBA:
Xiomara?

36:49.341 --> 36:50.542
Hey, what are you
doing here?

37:06.392 --> 37:09.528
Ma, no.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.996
I shouldn't have
said that to you.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.331
I get it.
No, no, no.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.020
EXECUTIVE:
So, as we close out
this journey,

37:35.053 --> 37:38.657
I just want to thank you all
for your devotion to Guillermo

37:38.690 --> 37:41.327
and for...
I got the rewrite.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.062
I saw you crush me like
a bug once you grow big.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.032
And we are officially
announcing a sequel.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.505
Rogelio, do you want
to say a few words?

37:53.539 --> 37:55.040
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment,

37:55.073 --> 37:56.875
with Alba's words
ringing in his ears,

37:56.908 --> 38:00.379
Rogelio realized
he had to be a bigger man.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.080
But not a giant.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.383
Drop everything.
We need an emergency rewrite.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.487
A baby needs her father,

38:08.520 --> 38:09.721
which is why

38:09.755 --> 38:11.289
I will take the next year off.

38:12.491 --> 38:13.825
Esteban will be your lead.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.961
And I will be

38:15.994 --> 38:17.596
your hero.

38:21.867 --> 38:24.570
PETRA:
Thank you.

38:24.603 --> 38:27.473
For... coming back.

38:27.506 --> 38:30.909
L-Look, you were right
about everything.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.678
The police came for my e-mails,

38:32.711 --> 38:34.946
my phone records, my time cards.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.416
And I don't need someone who's
gonna blow smoke up my ass.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.050
I need someone to make sure
I don't go to jail

38:39.084 --> 38:40.051
for protecting myself.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.921
You accused me of being a crook.

38:42.954 --> 38:45.424
And I am so sorry.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.626
Look...

38:47.659 --> 38:51.062
I know this
is not an excuse, but...

38:53.465 --> 38:56.134
...this is obviously
a very emotional time for me.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.969
My sister's dead,

38:58.003 --> 39:00.706
my hotel is in limbo, and...

39:00.739 --> 39:03.409
I-I don't have anyone

39:03.442 --> 39:04.876
on my side anymore.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.878
I had my ex in my corner,

39:06.912 --> 39:08.647
but I went
and ruined that, so...

39:08.680 --> 39:11.617
And now I'm all alone.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.887
What, do you get
some sick pleasure

39:15.921 --> 39:18.390
in other people's pain?
Keep wearing your heart
on your sleeve.

39:18.424 --> 39:21.092
It makes you a much more
sympathetic defendant.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.161
If you become a defendant,

39:23.194 --> 39:26.498
which I will work hard
to ensure that you don't.

39:30.502 --> 39:33.171
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw, look, Petra made a friend.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.140
Thank you.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.175
A friend who charges
$600 an hour,

39:37.208 --> 39:38.644
but still.

39:38.677 --> 39:41.012
I'd almost say
things are looking up.

39:42.648 --> 39:45.451
Okay, I'm her lawyer.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.486
What's next?

39:47.519 --> 39:49.087
There is no next.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.189
That's all the pictures.
It's just one room.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.592
Well, it's great.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.093
It will be great.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.729
We'll decorate it on
the cheap. I'm a pro.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.565
I'm looking forward to it.

39:59.598 --> 40:00.899
Me, too.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.435
Okay.
Hmm.

40:03.469 --> 40:05.637
Let me just ask.
Oh, please, don't let this

40:05.671 --> 40:08.640
be about the kiss.
Do you really not think
we have chemistry anymore?

40:08.674 --> 40:10.676
I don't know.
That's what you're saying.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.478
Okay, fine. You know what?

40:12.511 --> 40:13.745
Kiss me again.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.581
Are you serious?

40:15.614 --> 40:17.215
Let's do it. Go.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.685
Okay.

40:21.687 --> 40:23.589
Okay. Wow.

40:23.622 --> 40:26.758
Sorry. Okay. No.
You are obviously not
in the right headspace again.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.960
I'm fine. I'm ready.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.830
No, I don't want to anymore.
It is now or never.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.732
This is your window.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.235
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.638
Fine. Fine.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.807
Mm-hmm.
But first,

40:41.840 --> 40:43.208
you have to think
about what comes next.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.643
I've thought
everything through.
No.

40:45.877 --> 40:49.214
What I would do

40:49.247 --> 40:51.550
after we kiss.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.184
What do you mean?

40:53.218 --> 40:55.687
Like where I would put my...

40:55.721 --> 40:58.557
hand, for instance.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.225
Oh?

41:00.258 --> 41:04.062
And my... tongue.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.798
Where are you gonna put it?

41:08.834 --> 41:11.603
Oh, wow.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.272
That's just to start.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.808
Then I'd...

41:20.979 --> 41:22.981
Okay, kiss me now.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.222
Eh.

41:37.629 --> 41:41.299
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, what can I say?

41:41.332 --> 41:42.801
It felt like

41:42.834 --> 41:44.803
a telenovela.

41:53.211 --> 41:54.646
MATEO:
Yay!

41:54.680 --> 41:56.281
You guys are kissing!

41:56.314 --> 41:58.316
Does that mean
you're getting married?
