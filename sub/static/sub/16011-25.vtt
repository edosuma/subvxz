01:55.200 --> 01:58.120
[sobbing and sniffling]

01:58.160 --> 01:59.860
Okay, so their hands touched.

01:59.861 --> 02:01.560
What's the big deal?

02:01.600 --> 02:03.120
It's a big deal because

02:03.121 --> 02:04.640
they can never be together.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.280
- [sniffling] And they both
- know it.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.160
It's so tragic.

02:09.199 --> 02:10.759
What's tragic is I'll never

02:10.761 --> 02:12.320
get these two hours back.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.400
Psst.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.880
Already?

02:28.920 --> 02:30.480
I just got back!

02:30.520 --> 02:32.200
[Paula] Got back from where?

02:32.240 --> 02:34.120
That thing can't be charged yet.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.800
- You just plugged it in.
- What thing?

02:35.840 --> 02:37.496
- I know. But if it's lighting up
- again already,

02:37.520 --> 02:39.200
They must really need me.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.160
Who?

02:41.200 --> 02:42.760
Look, it's too big of risk!

02:42.800 --> 02:44.960
If that thing stops working then

02:45.000 --> 02:46.416
- you might not be able
- to get back!

02:46.440 --> 02:47.640
Back?!

02:47.680 --> 02:49.320
I have to take that chance!

02:49.360 --> 02:50.976
- There's only one piece
- of the Trumptus left

02:51.000 --> 02:52.020
And they need to know

02:52.021 --> 02:53.040
the new oracle!

02:53.080 --> 02:55.480
Who needs what?!

02:55.520 --> 02:56.940
You guys are really

02:56.941 --> 02:58.360
freaking me out right now!

03:00.360 --> 03:02.880
Why is that thing glowing?

03:02.920 --> 03:04.280
Hello?! Paula here!

03:04.281 --> 03:05.640
Still in the room!

03:05.680 --> 03:07.320
No idea what's going on!

03:07.360 --> 03:08.776
- I think it doesn't want
- to release

03:08.800 --> 03:10.080
Until it's fully charged.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.680
[gasps]

03:17.720 --> 03:19.400
Oh no, Vincent,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.320
what if I can't charge it up?

03:21.360 --> 03:23.536
- Will it have enough power
- to get me all the way there?

03:23.560 --> 03:24.740
It doesn't take much.

03:24.741 --> 03:25.920
I'm sure it's fine!

03:27.360 --> 03:30.200
Hi Mia. Say your password.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.600
- "North and South
- and West and East.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.440
- The last of pieces
- travels least"

03:48.760 --> 03:49.800
[gasps]

03:49.840 --> 03:51.480
The bracelet!

04:03.280 --> 04:05.640
[screams]

04:13.040 --> 04:14.520
[gasps] This is seriously

04:14.521 --> 04:16.000
not good.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.279
No bracelet means no way back!

04:18.320 --> 04:20.519
Vincent, you have to find a way.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.000
You have to!

04:23.320 --> 04:25.560
Mia just disintegrated!!

04:25.600 --> 04:27.640
She didn't disintegrate, ok?

04:27.641 --> 04:29.680
She just... de-materialized.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.240
DE-WHAT?!

04:31.280 --> 04:33.040
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!

04:33.080 --> 04:34.700
Look, it's okay, relax!

04:34.701 --> 04:36.320
She does this all the time.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.640
But this might be a problem.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.060
Come on, seriously,

04:50.061 --> 04:51.800
where is she?

04:51.840 --> 04:54.880
Is there a trap door in here?

04:54.920 --> 04:57.400
Look, okay?

04:57.440 --> 04:59.320
Sit down, I'll explain.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.940
This... is a doorway

05:05.941 --> 05:07.440
to this whole other world.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.920
Based on this.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.040
Mia's not hiding, I promise.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.040
But she's just in this

05:16.041 --> 05:18.000
other world somewhere. Get it?

05:18.040 --> 05:20.360
Not in any way, no.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.580
Yeah, that's why

05:21.581 --> 05:22.760
Mia never told you.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.220
I mean, it's kind of hard

05:24.221 --> 05:25.640
to get your head around.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.180
No, Vincent. Geometry is hard

05:27.181 --> 05:28.680
to get your head around.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.800
This is a whole other level.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.360
True.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.200
But here's the important part:

05:34.240 --> 05:35.900
if I can't get this

05:35.901 --> 05:37.560
powered up then... eh...

05:37.600 --> 05:39.960
Mia won't be able to get back.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.800
- Well let's get it
- powered up then.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.720
What?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.320
Aren't you supposed to

05:45.321 --> 05:46.880
be all freaked out about this?

05:46.920 --> 05:48.220
I've decided to take it

05:48.221 --> 05:49.520
pretty well for now.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.200
And all the freaking out

05:51.240 --> 05:53.440
- and not-believing-a-word-of-it
- can come later.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.120
[neighing]

05:58.040 --> 05:59.320
[Mia] Onchao?

06:02.120 --> 06:03.400
Onchao!

06:03.440 --> 06:04.680
[neighs]

06:04.720 --> 06:05.760
How did you get out here

06:05.800 --> 06:07.000
by yourself?

06:07.040 --> 06:08.080
[neighs]

06:09.880 --> 06:11.200
The secret tunnels aren't safe

06:11.201 --> 06:12.520
for you on your own.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.240
What was so important?

06:14.280 --> 06:15.360
[neighs]

06:15.400 --> 06:16.880
I'm sorry, I don't think

06:16.920 --> 06:18.520
you'll find any other unicorns.

06:18.560 --> 06:19.760
Not now.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.080
[snorts sadly]

06:21.120 --> 06:22.640
I know you are lonely

06:22.680 --> 06:24.680
but you've got us elves, right?

06:24.720 --> 06:25.960
[neighs]

06:26.000 --> 06:28.400
Busy? Busy with what?

06:28.440 --> 06:29.520
[rumble]

06:31.600 --> 06:32.920
That doesn't look right.

06:32.921 --> 06:34.240
Come on!

06:41.760 --> 06:43.880
Mia! Look out!

06:43.920 --> 06:47.000
Wha... WOOAAA!

06:47.040 --> 06:48.120
Ugh!

06:48.160 --> 06:49.640
Oohh..

06:49.680 --> 06:50.860
[Phuddle] Oh oh,

06:50.861 --> 06:52.040
this looks serious!

06:53.080 --> 06:56.440
It's okay, I'm... fine.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.680
[Mo] Anything, Phuddle?

06:59.040 --> 07:00.640
It's dry!

07:00.680 --> 07:02.320
That's all of them!

07:02.360 --> 07:03.460
There isn't a single

07:03.461 --> 07:04.560
water spout working!

07:04.600 --> 07:06.360
Um... what's going on?

07:06.400 --> 07:07.740
Of all the times

07:07.741 --> 07:09.080
for the water dome to dry up!

07:09.120 --> 07:10.120
There's more,

07:10.121 --> 07:11.121
coming in from the east!

07:11.160 --> 07:12.640
- More what?!
- Everybody!

07:12.680 --> 07:13.880
Back to the palace!

07:13.881 --> 07:15.080
Come on!

07:15.120 --> 07:17.160
Aaaagh!

07:17.200 --> 07:18.640
Wait! Mo!

07:18.680 --> 07:20.120
What's going on!?

07:20.160 --> 07:21.180
- [Yuko] Mia! Come on!

07:21.181 --> 07:22.200
- Aaaaah!

07:25.120 --> 07:26.520
[distant shrieking]

07:26.560 --> 07:28.840
[Mia] Oh no! Muncs!

07:28.880 --> 07:30.800
- Yep! And it looks like
- all of them!

07:30.840 --> 07:32.160
Come on! Hurry!

07:34.200 --> 07:35.520
Aaaagh!

07:39.040 --> 07:41.576
- [Mayla] Divide what little water
- we have amongst the warriors,

07:41.600 --> 07:43.240
And tell them to aim carefully,

07:43.241 --> 07:44.880
waste none.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.260
Tell the western patrol

07:46.261 --> 07:47.600
to come back to the palace.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.200
Tell them all to come back!

07:49.240 --> 07:51.320
Agh! Where is Onchao?!

07:51.360 --> 07:52.660
He is almost certainly

07:52.661 --> 07:53.960
Panthea's target!

07:54.000 --> 07:55.960
- [Mia] He's here!
- [Raynor] Mia!

07:56.000 --> 07:57.720
Always when we need you most!

07:57.760 --> 07:58.920
Is there an oracle?

07:58.921 --> 08:00.080
It is crucial that we find

08:00.120 --> 08:02.480
the last piece of the Trumptus!

08:02.520 --> 08:03.660
"North and south

08:03.661 --> 08:04.800
and west and east,

08:04.840 --> 08:06.200
the last of pieces

08:06.201 --> 08:07.560
traveled least."

08:07.600 --> 08:09.360
- [Phuddle] (SHOUTS)
- Your highnesses!

08:09.400 --> 08:10.940
[panting] The sentries say

08:10.941 --> 08:12.480
Panthea's almost here!

08:12.520 --> 08:15.080
Duuh! Aaaaw!

08:15.120 --> 08:17.080
Just a few more minutes!

08:17.120 --> 08:18.240
Panthea?!

08:18.280 --> 08:19.920
No time to lose then!

08:19.960 --> 08:21.040
If "the last piece

08:21.041 --> 08:22.120
traveled least"

08:22.160 --> 08:23.800
- then it's still
- where it started.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.760
- Right where Panthea shattered
- the Trumptus

08:25.800 --> 08:27.760
And scattered the pieces.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.160
The last piece is

08:29.161 --> 08:30.520
in Panthea's palace!

08:30.560 --> 08:32.559
[gasp]

08:32.600 --> 08:33.760
And the best part is...

08:33.799 --> 08:35.400
Panthea is not home!

08:35.440 --> 08:37.200
- And we will keep
- Panthea's army...

08:37.240 --> 08:39.480
Pre-occupied! To the tunnel!

08:45.680 --> 08:47.440
[coughing]

08:47.480 --> 08:49.680
Are you all right my Queeeen?

08:49.720 --> 08:51.140
Get me that little

08:51.141 --> 08:52.560
golden horned unicorn today

08:52.600 --> 08:54.360
- and I'll... be...
- [choking] ...perfect.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.600
[coughs]

08:58.160 --> 08:59.480
[Raynor] Panthea cannot know

08:59.481 --> 09:00.800
about this tunnel.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.696
- You should be able to pass
- right under her nose

09:02.720 --> 09:04.000
Without being seen.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.720
Nooo problem!

09:05.760 --> 09:08.320
Eh... oh... oooow...

09:09.960 --> 09:11.200
[laughs nervously]

09:13.200 --> 09:14.240
Um?

09:16.720 --> 09:18.120
Genius!

09:18.160 --> 09:20.480
Guard this with your very life.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.720
Mo, have you enough water?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.280
Did you hear that Onchao?

09:24.320 --> 09:26.760
She wants me to guard it, me!

09:26.800 --> 09:28.240
[snorts]

09:28.280 --> 09:29.920
Good luck, Onchao.

09:29.960 --> 09:30.960
We need you to find

09:30.961 --> 09:31.961
the last missing piece

09:32.000 --> 09:33.100
of the Trumptus,

09:33.101 --> 09:34.200
as only you can.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.480
And keep those kids

09:35.481 --> 09:36.720
out of trouble,

09:36.760 --> 09:38.080
[neighs]

09:40.040 --> 09:41.840
Let's go let's go let's go!

09:41.880 --> 09:43.680
Everybody follow me!

09:43.720 --> 09:45.040
We will delay Panthea

09:45.041 --> 09:46.360
as long as we can!

09:47.960 --> 09:49.280
[growling]

09:51.840 --> 09:53.680
Strength, Raynor.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.120
[loud growling]

09:59.160 --> 10:00.240
They're attacking.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.560
You can't, Mo.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.080
I have to do something!

10:03.120 --> 10:04.680
They need help!

10:04.720 --> 10:06.720
Oh!

10:06.760 --> 10:08.080
And I just thought of a way

10:08.081 --> 10:09.400
we can send them some!

10:09.440 --> 10:10.600
Trust me, Mo.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.120
Come on, it's on the way!

10:12.160 --> 10:13.640
Ok!

10:13.680 --> 10:14.720
I really hope

10:14.721 --> 10:15.760
you are right, Mia.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.000
RAAAAAAAAAHHRRR!!

10:25.600 --> 10:27.200
Just as I thought.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.520
The drought has spread

10:28.521 --> 10:29.800
to the elf palace.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.880
Their water dome is dried up.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.440
[cackles]

10:33.480 --> 10:36.520
Elves, hear my final proposal!

10:36.560 --> 10:37.920
Hand over the unicorn

10:37.921 --> 10:39.280
with the golden horn,

10:39.320 --> 10:41.520
and you will be spared!

10:41.560 --> 10:42.780
Defy me,

10:42.781 --> 10:44.000
and you will be crushed!

10:44.040 --> 10:45.760
Answer!

10:45.800 --> 10:48.760
Very well then, let's answer.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.680
Aaagh!

10:55.200 --> 10:56.400
Close in!

10:56.440 --> 10:58.000
But do it slowly!

10:58.040 --> 11:01.280
Let them feel the fear!

11:01.320 --> 11:03.020
But your majesty, shouldn't I

11:03.021 --> 11:04.720
be delivering the orders?

11:04.760 --> 11:06.360
Oh, stop pouting!

11:06.400 --> 11:08.840
- Just because I'm not letting you
- lead your army?!

11:08.880 --> 11:10.520
You're such a child.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.200
Yes, my Queen.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.600
[Mia] The Water Unicorn's

11:19.601 --> 11:20.680
Grotto?!

11:20.720 --> 11:22.420
The elemental unicorns need

11:22.421 --> 11:24.120
to know what's going on, right?

11:24.160 --> 11:25.280
They've never come

11:25.281 --> 11:26.400
to help the elves before,

11:26.440 --> 11:27.640
but there's a first time

11:27.641 --> 11:28.840
for everything! Come on!

11:30.440 --> 11:31.936
- [Mia] You don't think
- the Water Unicorn

11:31.960 --> 11:33.880
- Would have abandoned Centopia?
- Do you?

11:33.920 --> 11:35.520
Who would blame her?

11:36.320 --> 11:38.160
[neighs]

11:38.200 --> 11:41.120
[neighing echoes]

11:42.440 --> 11:44.640
If she's here, she heard that.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.760
Water Unicorn!

11:48.761 --> 11:50.520
Centopia is dying.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.880
The unicorns are...

11:51.920 --> 11:53.760
are mostly gone.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.300
The elves are

11:55.301 --> 11:56.800
Centopia's only hope.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.840
They need your help.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.640
- [Mo] There's nobody
- left to help us.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.440
We're on our own.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.780
[cries] I just thought

12:05.781 --> 12:07.080
maybe there was a chance.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.520
Hey, it's okay. We'll make it.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.320
Or go down trying, right?

12:23.880 --> 12:26.560
[grunting]

12:27.320 --> 12:28.360
Ugh!

12:38.160 --> 12:39.440
Raaahrr!

12:43.040 --> 12:44.280
There's too many of them!

12:44.320 --> 12:45.640
Our fate rests

12:45.680 --> 12:47.120
with the last Trumptus piece.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.080
[gasp]

12:58.120 --> 12:59.680
[cough]

12:59.720 --> 13:01.360
Let's NOT do that again!

13:01.400 --> 13:02.640
- [distant growling]
- [gasps]

13:07.280 --> 13:08.920
Sssh!

13:08.960 --> 13:11.680
Onchao, Phuddle. Wait here!

13:11.720 --> 13:13.720
Onchao, you stay here!

13:18.040 --> 13:19.080
Ohh!

13:19.120 --> 13:20.920
Shhh!

13:20.960 --> 13:22.360
[Mo] Well, Panthea's not

13:22.361 --> 13:23.760
completely crazy.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.600
She left some guards behind.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.960
It's still the best opportunity

13:26.961 --> 13:28.280
we've ever had.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.240
- [neighing]
- [gasp]

13:30.280 --> 13:32.440
The unicorns!

13:32.480 --> 13:33.820
[Mia] That's where

13:33.821 --> 13:35.160
they are keeping Lyria

13:32.480 --> 13:35.160
and the other unicorns!

13:37.240 --> 13:38.460
[whispering] Now is our

13:38.461 --> 13:39.680
chance to rescue them too!

13:39.720 --> 13:41.480
- [shouts] Totally!
- Sssh!

13:41.520 --> 13:44.000
- [whispering] If Onchao finds out
- his mother is here,

13:44.040 --> 13:45.120
He'll go nuts!

13:45.121 --> 13:46.200
We need him focused.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.520
Mia, you take Onchao

13:47.521 --> 13:48.800
into the palace

13:48.840 --> 13:50.600
- and get him to find
- the Trumptus piece.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.020
We'll free the unicorns

13:52.021 --> 13:53.400
and then meet you back here.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.160
What about me?!

13:55.200 --> 13:56.680
You go with Mia and Onchao.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.320
- When they find
- the Trumptus piece,

13:58.360 --> 13:59.580
You have to assemble

13:59.581 --> 14:00.800
the Trumptus right away.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.360
Let's go let's go!

14:05.920 --> 14:07.240
Good luck.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.560
You too.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.200
Ehem... ehem...

14:12.240 --> 14:14.040
We have a world to save...

14:14.080 --> 14:15.780
Um... yeah... I...

14:15.781 --> 14:17.480
better get going. He...

14:18.760 --> 14:20.560
[neighs]

14:20.600 --> 14:21.940
They're, uh... they're just

14:21.941 --> 14:23.280
scouting ahead for us.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.640
Come on!

14:45.840 --> 14:48.160
- [whispering] I don't like this.
- It's too easy.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.920
What's wrong with easy?!

14:49.960 --> 14:51.560
Easy is good!

14:51.600 --> 14:52.640
[gasps]

14:54.000 --> 14:55.600
[snoring]

14:55.640 --> 14:57.160
What?! What's wrong?! Ouh!

14:57.200 --> 14:58.240
Sssh!

14:58.280 --> 14:59.320
Sorry!

14:59.360 --> 15:01.320
[meows]

15:04.440 --> 15:06.680
Onchao! You look over there

15:06.720 --> 15:08.880
Ah... What should I do?

15:08.920 --> 15:10.680
Keep a look out for muncs!

15:13.080 --> 15:14.320
Uumm...

15:16.640 --> 15:18.480
[neighing]

15:21.600 --> 15:22.960
[neighing and snorting]

15:23.000 --> 15:24.560
SPLASH! SPLASH!

15:30.400 --> 15:31.640
Hello!

15:32.840 --> 15:34.200
Good-bye!

15:37.600 --> 15:38.640
Boo!

15:41.080 --> 15:42.400
[grunts with effort]

15:43.640 --> 15:44.880
[neighs loudly]

15:44.920 --> 15:46.920
It's okay! We're here to help!

15:46.960 --> 15:48.400
Aaagh! I can't...

15:48.401 --> 15:49.840
get it... open...

15:49.880 --> 15:51.040
[gasps]

15:51.080 --> 15:52.400
Lyria!

15:54.480 --> 15:56.520
We're going to get you out!

15:56.560 --> 15:58.200
[neighs]

15:58.240 --> 16:00.280
I don't know what you're saying!

16:00.320 --> 16:01.920
[neighs]

16:01.960 --> 16:04.080
[grunts]

16:04.920 --> 16:06.640
[neighs]

16:06.680 --> 16:08.480
Um... Mo... I think

16:08.481 --> 16:10.280
she is trying to warn us..

16:10.320 --> 16:11.920
Maybe you shouldn't do that...

16:11.960 --> 16:13.000
Got it!

16:15.520 --> 16:16.720
[whistling]

16:16.760 --> 16:18.360
That's gonna be a problem.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.560
AAAAAH!

16:19.600 --> 16:20.880
This is not good,

16:20.920 --> 16:22.000
not good at all!

16:22.040 --> 16:23.920
- Aaagh!
- Aaagh!

16:25.360 --> 16:26.400
[whistles]

16:26.440 --> 16:27.480
Boom!

16:27.520 --> 16:28.560
Oh!

16:29.680 --> 16:30.880
[moans fearfully]

16:30.920 --> 16:32.040
[Mia] Oh oh!

16:33.200 --> 16:34.240
Meooww...

16:35.200 --> 16:36.600
[growls]

16:36.640 --> 16:39.120
It's okay! Remember me?

16:39.160 --> 16:41.640
[Mia] You like me, remember?

16:41.680 --> 16:42.880
[meows]

16:42.920 --> 16:44.280
[purrs]

16:44.320 --> 16:46.240
Aaah... I got him!

16:46.280 --> 16:48.240
- No, Phuddle!
- [cat screeches]

16:48.280 --> 16:50.680
OW! Bad kitty!

16:50.720 --> 16:52.400
Meeoowwww!

16:52.440 --> 16:54.120
[Phuddle] Ow ow ow...

16:54.160 --> 16:57.000
[Phuddle] Ah ah! Ou! Ouch!

16:57.040 --> 16:59.560
Onchao! Phuddle! Let's go!

16:59.600 --> 17:00.880
[cat screeches]

17:00.920 --> 17:02.880
Ahhh! Ough...

17:02.920 --> 17:05.000
Wooooo...

17:05.760 --> 17:07.000
Aaah!

17:07.040 --> 17:09.800
Wooooaa.. aaah! Oh!

17:09.839 --> 17:11.119
[Phuddle grunts]

17:11.160 --> 17:12.359
[Onchao snorts]

17:16.040 --> 17:18.400
Thanks, Onchao! Come on!

17:19.119 --> 17:20.359
[neighs]

17:22.319 --> 17:23.560
[neighs]

17:25.359 --> 17:26.460
We'll never be able

17:26.461 --> 17:27.560
to outrun them!

17:30.240 --> 17:31.760
That's perfect!

17:32.760 --> 17:34.560
This way! In here!

17:37.240 --> 17:39.200
What is this place?!

17:39.240 --> 17:40.880
I think it's a munc nest.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.280
A munc's nest?

17:42.320 --> 17:44.120
- Are you nuts??
- Shhh!

17:49.080 --> 17:50.360
They'll never think

17:50.361 --> 17:51.640
of looking for us here!

17:51.680 --> 17:52.740
[whispers] Just stay quiet

17:52.741 --> 17:53.800
and out of sight.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.600
Yuko and Mo, where are you?!

17:57.680 --> 17:59.200
[grunting with effort]

18:00.240 --> 18:02.480
Agh! It's no use Mo,

18:02.520 --> 18:04.240
- we'll never gonna
- get out of here!

18:13.160 --> 18:14.720
Raahhrrr!

18:18.720 --> 18:20.200
- Rahhrr!
- Ugh!

18:25.800 --> 18:27.120
Agh!

18:31.080 --> 18:32.240
RAAHHH!

18:34.000 --> 18:35.040
Ha ha!

18:35.080 --> 18:36.840
Well done, my dear!

18:45.040 --> 18:46.800
Oh no!

18:46.840 --> 18:48.200
We are out of water!

18:48.201 --> 18:49.560
Sound the retreat.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.560
[blows horn]

18:55.400 --> 18:57.000
They're retreating!

18:57.040 --> 18:58.580
Move your troops in!

18:58.581 --> 19:00.120
Finish them off!

19:02.120 --> 19:03.880
[wild neighing]

19:10.160 --> 19:13.280
[gasps] The Fire Unicorn?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.480
[neighs]

19:14.520 --> 19:15.560
[rumble]

19:16.880 --> 19:17.920
[neighing]

19:17.960 --> 19:19.120
[Mayla] Wind.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.920
[earthquake noises]

19:27.880 --> 19:29.840
[neighs]

19:29.880 --> 19:30.920
Earth.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.080
[high-pitched neighing]

19:44.120 --> 19:46.120
[Raynor] And Water.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.100
Why do I have the feeling Mia

19:48.101 --> 19:50.040
has something to do with this?

19:50.080 --> 19:51.900
I thought you said

19:51.901 --> 19:53.720
there were no unicorns left!

19:53.760 --> 19:55.360
Those ones are...

19:55.361 --> 19:56.960
different, my Queen.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.480
[piercing neighing]

20:05.240 --> 20:06.560
[neighs wildly]

20:12.880 --> 20:14.360
[wind whistles]

20:22.480 --> 20:23.520
- Ouhh!
- Ouhh!

20:24.560 --> 20:26.320
[Panthea] Retreaat!

20:31.120 --> 20:32.560
[Panthea] AAGH! GET ME

20:32.561 --> 20:34.000
OUT OF HERE!

20:38.080 --> 20:40.120
My dear, this has suddenly

20:40.121 --> 20:42.160
turned into a very nice day.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.780
I only hope

20:43.781 --> 20:45.360
Mia is faring so well.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.720
I think the muncs gave up.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.020
That's exactly

20:54.021 --> 20:55.280
what we should do.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.540
That's the one thing

20:56.541 --> 20:57.760
we can't do, Phuddle.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.140
The last piece of

20:59.141 --> 21:00.480
the Trumptus is right there!

21:03.680 --> 21:04.720
Besides,

21:04.721 --> 21:05.760
you're close to becoming

21:05.800 --> 21:08.280
the very first Pan ever

21:08.320 --> 21:10.000
to save Centopia.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.560
How would that feel?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.820
People would bring you

21:12.821 --> 21:14.040
partridgberries.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.520
All I can eat?

21:15.560 --> 21:17.040
- A-ha!

21:17.041 --> 21:18.520
- Well what are we waiting for?!

21:18.560 --> 21:20.840
Great! I have an idea!

21:20.880 --> 21:22.280
Okay, first things first.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.560
All right, it's done!

21:36.920 --> 21:39.000
It's still not working!

21:39.040 --> 21:40.400
Wait a minute...

21:40.440 --> 21:42.360
It's not connected right!

21:43.360 --> 21:44.940
- HA HA!

21:44.941 --> 21:46.520
- YES!

21:46.560 --> 21:48.560
- Shall I press the button?!
- No, don't!

21:49.760 --> 21:51.600
Oh no! Vincent!

21:51.640 --> 21:53.320
Why do you have to be so smart!?

21:53.360 --> 21:54.720
Onchao, Phuddle.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.520
Stay hidden! Wait for me!

21:57.360 --> 21:59.360
Mia! Nooo!

21:59.400 --> 22:00.920
[neighs]

22:00.960 --> 22:02.400
What's a Vincent?

22:05.440 --> 22:06.880
- WHOA!
- [Mia] Vincent,

22:06.920 --> 22:08.240
I need to get back there!

22:08.280 --> 22:10.080
- Why?
- The elves need me!

22:11.440 --> 22:12.640
Elves?!

22:12.680 --> 22:13.880
I'll explain later.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.160
They're in terrible danger!

22:15.200 --> 22:16.400
I need to go back there now!

22:16.440 --> 22:17.480
Ok.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.940
Uum... If these elves

22:22.941 --> 22:24.720
or whatever are in danger,

22:24.760 --> 22:26.440
does that mean you are too?

22:27.240 --> 22:28.800
Hey,

22:28.840 --> 22:30.840
that's a really good question!
