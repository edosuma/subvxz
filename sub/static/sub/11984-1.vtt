01:51.388 --> 01:52.956
I didn't think everyone
would drive up from Spokane.

01:53.023 --> 01:54.591
Yeah, it's nice.

01:54.658 --> 01:57.126
Well, your daddy was a very
easy man to like.

01:57.194 --> 01:58.161
Yeah.

01:58.229 --> 02:01.064
Wasn't he, Cam?

02:01.131 --> 02:04.901
That he was.

02:04.969 --> 02:07.070
I'm really gonna miss him.

02:07.137 --> 02:09.205
Me too, baby.

Hey!

02:14.144 --> 02:15.478
Your doctor said no smoking!

You ok?

03:32.690 --> 03:36.259

You know, I don't have to go
this semester, I can stay.

03:39.563 --> 03:41.698
I can stay here with you

Don't you be silly.

03:43.567 --> 03:48.771
Besides, what did we promise
your father?

03:48.839 --> 03:50.440
That we would go on living.

03:50.507 --> 03:51.774
That's right.

03:51.842 --> 03:54.444
Which is why I'm going
to learn how to fly solo.

03:57.915 --> 03:59.816
Ok, well I'll leave that
dress here to keep you company.

03:59.883 --> 04:01.351
I might take this scarf.

Glad you're here.

I thought maybe you'd
changed your mind again.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.534
No, I tried but she wouldn't
let me.

04:18.601 --> 04:19.502
Can you take those, too?

04:19.570 --> 04:20.103
Thank you.

04:20.170 --> 04:21.536
Wow!

04:21.605 --> 04:25.308
Yeah, it's all ah, you know,
school things.

04:29.947 --> 04:31.848
Good morning.

04:31.915 --> 04:34.384
Well, does she have to bring
all her shoes?

04:34.451 --> 04:35.918
Oh, thank you.

04:35.986 --> 04:36.753
I hope it's strong enough.

I'm sure it is.

How're you doing?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Aw, you.

04:47.264 --> 04:49.065
It's your big day.

04:52.503 --> 04:54.637
I'm going to come home, like,
every weekend.

04:54.705 --> 04:55.238
Ok?

04:55.305 --> 04:56.239
Honey, I'm fine.

04:56.306 --> 04:57.974
I know, but I think I should.

04:58.042 --> 04:59.242
We should plan some stuff,

04:59.309 --> 05:01.811

or something.

I know you are.

05:10.721 --> 05:12.288
Just call me and I'll be here,
ok?

05:12.356 --> 05:13.289
Ok.

I love you.

05:17.928 --> 05:20.029
Alright, get in there before
Uncle Cam has another coronary.

05:20.097 --> 05:21.030
Oh dear.

05:21.098 --> 05:22.065
Agh!!!

05:22.132 --> 05:24.333
Agh! Ah, it hurts!

05:24.401 --> 05:26.135
Ahhhh!

05:26.203 --> 05:28.971
Bye, baby, love you!

05:44.088 --> 05:46.089
Hey, Brooks!

05:53.330 --> 05:55.098
Now, the type of psychiatric
disorder we're talking about,

05:55.165 --> 05:56.566
it forms at a sub-conscious
level...

05:56.633 --> 05:57.667
Why do you keep saying that?

05:57.735 --> 05:58.601
I'm not like that!!

05:58.702 --> 06:00.770
Adam, tell him!

06:00.838 --> 06:04.240
Ben, Dr. Schwartstein's trying
to help you.

06:04.308 --> 06:06.342
Please listen to him.

06:06.410 --> 06:08.778
Ben, listen.

06:08.846 --> 06:09.979
I was not suggesting

06:10.047 --> 06:12.181
that you are in control
of these behaviours.

06:12.249 --> 06:15.318
Or that you've been dishonest
with us.

06:15.385 --> 06:19.122
Your mother, she was sick
for a long time.

06:19.189 --> 06:21.958
Years.

06:22.025 --> 06:24.127
And after her death, you've been
experiencing mood swings

06:24.194 --> 06:26.796
and had trouble sleeping.

06:26.864 --> 06:30.366
Once in a while.

06:30.434 --> 06:31.634
And how often would you say
you've been hearing

06:31.702 --> 06:34.137
the voices in your head?

06:36.206 --> 06:38.007
Not too often.

06:41.845 --> 06:44.280
Ben, sometimes when a
person's normal coping methods

06:44.348 --> 06:48.151
become overwhelmed,
they begin to express

06:48.218 --> 06:52.088
psychological distress
physically.

06:52.156 --> 06:55.525
Here, you can read this at home.

06:55.592 --> 06:58.461
Now, the type of psychiatric
disorder we're talking about,

06:58.529 --> 07:00.329
it forms a
sub-conscious level.

07:00.430 --> 07:04.667
You wouldn't even be
aware of it.

07:04.735 --> 07:06.903
Give this to someone
who needs it.

07:06.970 --> 07:08.471
Ben, hold on!

07:08.539 --> 07:11.340
Ben!

07:11.408 --> 07:14.677
Adam, I would get Ben into
treatment as soon as possible.

07:14.745 --> 07:16.312
His symptoms indicate that
he's suffering from

07:16.380 --> 07:19.148
at least one dissociative
disorder,

07:19.216 --> 07:23.119
and that points to a more
chronic and severe
psychopathology.

07:23.187 --> 07:24.353
Ok.

07:24.421 --> 07:25.421
Ok, thank you.

07:25.489 --> 07:28.858
Good luck.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.560
Ben!

07:30.627 --> 07:31.327
Ben, hold on!

07:31.395 --> 07:32.628
No, he thinks I'm crazy!

07:32.696 --> 07:33.830
No, he doesn't.

07:33.897 --> 07:36.432
He's talking to me like
I'm some kind of psycho!

07:36.500 --> 07:37.767
Wait, no, no.

07:37.835 --> 07:39.702
It's one opinion.

07:39.770 --> 07:41.437
That's why we went to him,
right?

07:41.505 --> 07:44.106
For another opinion?

07:44.174 --> 07:45.541
I'm working at a hospital again,

07:45.609 --> 07:49.478
I will get you the best medical
help available, I promise.

07:52.749 --> 07:54.483
I'm here for you, ok?

07:54.551 --> 07:56.052
Ok.

07:57.855 --> 08:00.389
Come on, let me get you
something to eat.

08:00.457 --> 08:02.458
Ok.

08:02.526 --> 08:04.393
You forgot this.

08:16.006 --> 08:16.639
Ow!

08:20.744 --> 08:22.211
Sorry!

08:22.279 --> 08:25.481
So you say that now...

08:25.549 --> 08:29.318
Well, you're the one texting.

08:29.386 --> 08:30.219
Let's start over.

08:30.287 --> 08:31.087
Hi!

08:31.154 --> 08:32.087
I'm Ariel Morgan.

08:32.923 --> 08:33.923
It's nice to meet you.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.558
Ariel Morgan,
good to meet you.

08:36.626 --> 08:38.260
I'm late for class.

08:38.328 --> 08:40.730
Ok...

08:40.797 --> 08:43.198
what's your name?

08:43.267 --> 08:47.003

Hey!

09:12.562 --> 09:16.799
So, it's Friday again.

09:16.867 --> 09:19.902
I am well aware of that.

09:19.970 --> 09:23.739
What's the verdict?

09:23.807 --> 09:25.775
<i>It's been eight and a half
weeks,</i>

09:25.842 --> 09:27.910
<i>and you haven't come out.</i>

09:27.978 --> 09:31.547
<i>Come on, you can't wallow around
in there forever.</i>

09:31.615 --> 09:37.620
<i>Life marches on,
with or without you.</i>

09:37.688 --> 09:39.755
Come on, Dana,
are you still there?

09:39.823 --> 09:41.824
Yeah.

09:41.892 --> 09:43.926
Where else would I be?

09:43.994 --> 09:46.963
Listen, I've got my last
surgery at 6:00,

09:47.030 --> 09:48.864
why don't I swing by
and pick you up?

09:48.932 --> 09:50.232

at this meeting,</i>

09:50.300 --> 09:52.902

09:56.139 --> 09:58.975

Hey, slow down, slow down.

10:31.575 --> 10:34.643
Ariel Morgan!

10:34.711 --> 10:37.113
Hi, yeah.

10:37.180 --> 10:39.148
Look, I'm sorry if I was rude
this morning,

10:39.216 --> 10:41.550
I had to drop a course.

10:41.618 --> 10:43.786
You were a little rude.

10:43.854 --> 10:45.287
I'm Ben Woods,
I'm a freshman.

10:45.355 --> 10:47.957
Hi, Ben Woods.

10:48.025 --> 10:49.825
This is, uh, sorry.

10:49.893 --> 10:51.093
This is Adam, my stepfather.

10:51.161 --> 10:52.194
Hi.

10:52.262 --> 10:53.662
Ariel. Nice to meet you.

10:53.730 --> 10:54.830
Nice to meet you.

10:54.898 --> 10:56.866
So, uh, where you off to?

10:56.933 --> 10:58.634
I'm just going to the bus,
going home for the weekend.

10:58.702 --> 11:01.037
So... Ridgewood.

11:01.104 --> 11:01.871
Oh, nice.

11:01.938 --> 11:02.738
That's where we're going.

11:02.806 --> 11:04.206
You're going to Ridgewood?

11:04.274 --> 11:06.342
You wanna hop in?

11:06.410 --> 11:08.010
Uh, yeah.

11:08.078 --> 11:08.744
That would be great!

11:08.812 --> 11:09.445
Hop in.

11:09.513 --> 11:10.946
Ok.

11:13.216 --> 11:15.284
Are you from the Ridgewood
Ariel?

11:15.352 --> 11:17.219
Uh, no, I'm from Spokane
actually.

11:17.287 --> 11:19.455
We moved here last summer.

11:19.523 --> 11:20.923
We're from Seattle.

11:20.991 --> 11:23.659
Oh, cool, what made you move
to Ridgewood?

11:23.727 --> 11:26.762
I had a job opportunity
at the hospital.

11:26.830 --> 11:28.197
How does your family
like it here?

11:28.265 --> 11:31.000
It's alright, it's really
just my dad's hometown,

11:31.068 --> 11:32.601
but it's just me
and my mom now.

11:32.669 --> 11:35.337
My dad passed away
this summer.

11:35.405 --> 11:38.074
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:38.141 --> 11:39.975
You must have a lot
of family here.

11:40.043 --> 11:41.544
Not really,

11:41.611 --> 11:44.313
all my dad's relatives don't
really live here anymore,

11:44.381 --> 11:46.248
and my mom is
from Georgia.

11:46.316 --> 11:47.950
Oh, your mother's
from the South?

11:48.018 --> 11:49.418
Yeah, Savannah.

11:49.486 --> 11:51.454
But her parents died
when she was young

11:51.521 --> 11:52.922
and she moved away
after that

11:52.989 --> 11:54.590
so there's no real connection
there anymore.

11:54.658 --> 11:57.726
She doesn't even really
have an accent.

11:57.794 --> 12:01.197
It's just me and my mom
and my uncle Cam.

12:01.264 --> 12:03.199
Starting over is never easy.

12:03.266 --> 12:05.868
Yeah.

12:05.936 --> 12:07.770
How's she doing now?

12:07.838 --> 12:09.171
Uh, she's alright.

12:09.239 --> 12:11.474
She's trying this new grief
counseling thing tonight

12:11.541 --> 12:12.808
at my church,

12:12.876 --> 12:14.577
so hopefully that'll help
get her out more.

12:19.116 --> 12:20.116
There you go.

12:20.183 --> 12:21.050
Thank you.

12:21.151 --> 12:22.318
You're welcome.

12:24.521 --> 12:25.788
Thank you for the ride.

12:25.856 --> 12:27.056
No problem.

12:27.157 --> 12:27.990
I'll see you at school?

12:28.058 --> 12:28.657
Yeah.

12:28.725 --> 12:29.558
Ok.

12:29.626 --> 12:31.060
Have a good weekend!

12:31.128 --> 12:32.728

Yes I did.

Can you let your mother
know I'm here?

13:08.431 --> 13:10.399
Mother, Uncle Cam's here!

13:10.467 --> 13:12.034
I could have yelled at her,
myself.

13:12.102 --> 13:14.103
Nobody needs to yell,
I'm right here.

13:14.171 --> 13:15.237
You ready?

13:15.305 --> 13:17.239
Yes, thank you for coming
to get me.

13:17.307 --> 13:18.374
I will be in the car.

13:18.441 --> 13:19.141
I will be back around 8:00.

13:19.209 --> 13:19.808

13:19.876 --> 13:20.442
Thanks, babe.

13:20.510 --> 13:21.110
Love you.

13:21.178 --> 13:22.378
Love you, too.

13:22.445 --> 13:23.679
How do you sleep at night?

13:23.747 --> 13:25.714
I'm tougher than you.

13:33.056 --> 13:34.523
You missed the introductions,

13:34.591 --> 13:37.760
but why don't you tell us
who you are?

13:37.827 --> 13:40.863
Um, alright.

13:40.931 --> 13:45.935
Um, my name is Dana Morgan.

13:46.002 --> 13:49.572
Oh, we're on a first name
basis here.

13:49.639 --> 13:50.940
Ok, uh...

13:51.007 --> 13:53.475
Dana.

13:53.543 --> 13:58.247
I grew up in Savannah,
but I've lived in Spokane

13:58.315 --> 14:01.283
for the last 20 years
with Jack.

14:01.351 --> 14:04.253
Jack was my husband.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.823
We moved to Ridgewood last year
with our daughter, Ariel,

14:07.891 --> 14:14.230
right after he was diagnosed
with lung cancer.

14:14.297 --> 14:18.067
We were going to beat it.

14:18.134 --> 14:21.570
Jack died this summer.

14:21.638 --> 14:25.241
How do you feel
about Jack's death?

14:27.544 --> 14:31.680
I uh...

14:31.781 --> 14:35.684
I feel like I'm still sharing
my life with him.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.021
Nothing's changed.

14:39.089 --> 14:45.628
Except he's not here.

14:45.695 --> 14:47.696
<i>Who else feels like Dana?</i>

14:50.033 --> 14:52.167
You'd rather be anywhere
but here.

14:56.439 --> 14:58.607
Excuse me?

14:58.675 --> 15:02.111
You don't seem the group type.

15:02.178 --> 15:05.047
Am I that obvious?

15:05.115 --> 15:07.750
Maybe not to everyone.

15:07.817 --> 15:09.485
I'm Adam.

15:09.552 --> 15:10.552
Dana Morgan.

15:10.620 --> 15:13.489
No last names, remember?

15:13.556 --> 15:16.959
You're right, I do hate groups.

15:17.027 --> 15:18.227
Normally I would agree
with you,

15:18.295 --> 15:21.563
but in this circumstance
I think talking helps.

15:21.631 --> 15:23.666
Your daughter told me
about this group.

15:23.733 --> 15:25.334
Ariel?

15:25.402 --> 15:27.936
My stepson Ben goes
to school with here.

15:28.004 --> 15:29.738
Oh, wow.

15:29.806 --> 15:30.906
We recently moved
from Seattle.

15:31.007 --> 15:34.743
I was in a group there.

15:34.811 --> 15:38.781
So when did your wife
pass away?

15:38.848 --> 15:41.283
Karen died eight months ago.

15:44.187 --> 15:47.823
Everyone take your seats,
please.

15:47.891 --> 15:50.259
We should get back.

15:55.565 --> 15:56.699
Boo!

15:56.766 --> 15:58.934
[laughing]

15:59.002 --> 16:01.203
I was taking a little
power nap.

16:01.304 --> 16:03.672
I could see that.

16:03.740 --> 16:06.308
So, how did it go?

16:06.376 --> 16:08.110
You know what?

16:08.178 --> 16:09.778
You were right.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.551
You know him?

16:15.618 --> 16:18.320
His wife died eight months ago.

16:18.388 --> 16:20.923
Sure looks broken up
about it.

16:20.990 --> 16:22.958
Really? Cameron Morgan?

16:23.026 --> 16:25.260
I'm just looking out for you.

16:27.263 --> 16:29.198
[Laughs]

16:29.265 --> 16:30.466
Well?

16:30.533 --> 16:32.735
He didn't look that
broken up!

16:52.956 --> 16:55.324
So other than the work load,
you're enjoying it?

16:55.392 --> 16:57.393
Well, college kinda
is the work load.

16:57.460 --> 17:00.062
But I'm doing pretty well in
chemistry and anatomy,

17:00.130 --> 17:01.697
but that's just because
I spent all those summers

17:01.765 --> 17:04.700
in Uncle Cam's clinic.

17:04.768 --> 17:07.368
Physics is challenging.

17:07.436 --> 17:08.871
Well, you're a smart girl.

17:08.938 --> 17:11.240
You're gonna figure it out.

17:11.307 --> 17:12.040
Oh, hey.

17:12.108 --> 17:13.709
I forgot to tell you...

17:13.777 --> 17:17.445
I met the father of a friend
of yours last weekend.

17:17.513 --> 17:19.515
I think he said his
son's name is Ben?

17:19.582 --> 17:20.883
Adam? Ben's stepfather?

17:20.950 --> 17:23.886
Oh, that's right,
he did say stepson.

17:23.953 --> 17:25.753
Where'd you meet Adam?

17:25.821 --> 17:28.857
At that group that Cam
took us to.

17:28.925 --> 17:30.058
Your grief group?

17:30.126 --> 17:32.161
What was Adam doing
at your grief group?

17:32.228 --> 17:33.796
He lost his wife.
Ben's mom.

17:33.897 --> 17:34.897
He didn't tell you that?

17:34.998 --> 17:37.800
No, I didn't know that.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.201
That's kinda weird.

17:39.269 --> 17:41.236
Why is that weird?

17:41.304 --> 17:42.905
Well, just 'cause they drove
me home last weekend

17:43.006 --> 17:44.640
and I was talking about you
and dad the whole time

17:44.707 --> 17:47.075
but they didn't really
say anything.

17:47.143 --> 17:49.378
Well, Adam said he had
you to thank

17:49.446 --> 17:50.646
for telling him about the group.

17:50.713 --> 17:52.347
He was very appreciative.

17:52.415 --> 17:53.749
Hmm.

17:53.817 --> 17:56.585
And, you know, maybe Ben's
just not that open, right?

18:27.050 --> 18:28.317
Hey.

18:28.384 --> 18:29.985
Hey.

18:30.053 --> 18:31.286
You uh...

18:31.354 --> 18:33.188
you want to go for a walk
with me?

18:33.256 --> 18:36.191
A walk?

18:36.259 --> 18:37.459
Right now?

18:37.527 --> 18:38.627
Yeah, you want to go
for a walk?

18:38.695 --> 18:40.262
Shh!

18:41.431 --> 18:42.431
What?

18:57.413 --> 18:58.680
That could get you in trouble.

18:58.748 --> 18:59.748
What?

18:59.816 --> 19:01.049
What you did back there
with that geek.

19:01.117 --> 19:03.652
Well, my father taught me
to be a very strong,

19:03.720 --> 19:06.054
independent woman
who can defend herself.

19:06.122 --> 19:08.257
Nice.

19:08.324 --> 19:09.992
Ooh, I like your socks,
by the way.

19:10.059 --> 19:12.594
Do you always mis-match,
or just today?

19:12.662 --> 19:15.564
Uh, it comes with doing
my own laundry, I guess.

19:15.632 --> 19:16.665
[Laughs]

19:16.733 --> 19:18.000
I like it.

19:18.067 --> 19:20.602
Thanks.

19:20.670 --> 19:24.773
So I'm hoping to get into
vet school after my undergrad.

19:24.841 --> 19:26.275
I worked in my
uncle Cam's clinic

19:26.342 --> 19:29.044
for about five summers now,

19:29.112 --> 19:33.081
and I like it but I have to get
at least a 3.5 GPA

19:33.182 --> 19:35.584
if anybody's even gonna
look at me.

19:35.652 --> 19:36.985
You know Adam tried
to be a doctor?

19:37.053 --> 19:37.686
Really?

19:37.754 --> 19:38.921
Yeah.

19:38.988 --> 19:40.355
I mean, the guy knows
more about medical stuff

19:40.423 --> 19:42.457
than most hospitals
but I don't know.

19:42.525 --> 19:44.026
His grades weren't
good enough.

19:44.093 --> 19:45.360
What did he end up doing?

19:45.428 --> 19:47.963
Well, now he's an ER nurse
at Ridgewood General.

19:48.031 --> 19:49.298
until I finish school.

19:49.365 --> 19:51.033
That's nice.

19:51.100 --> 19:54.436
Hey, did he tell you that he
actually went

19:54.504 --> 19:56.738
to that grief group thing I was
talking about at my church?

19:56.806 --> 19:57.573
Really?

19:57.640 --> 19:59.775
Yeah, he met my mom there.

19:59.842 --> 20:00.509
No.

20:00.577 --> 20:02.778
Small world.

20:02.845 --> 20:04.680
Oh, I'm sorry about your mom,
by the way.

20:04.747 --> 20:05.614
I didn't know.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.116
Yeah.

20:08.184 --> 20:10.886
Yeah, so am I.

20:12.789 --> 20:13.855
Shoot, you know what?

20:13.923 --> 20:15.691
I think I have a chem lab
right now.

20:15.758 --> 20:16.858
Yeah, ooh, right now.

20:16.926 --> 20:17.926
I have to go, I'm sorry.

20:17.994 --> 20:20.195
Ok, great.

20:20.263 --> 20:21.263
I'll see you later.

20:21.331 --> 20:22.965
Bye.

20:34.177 --> 20:35.744
Hey Ariel.

20:35.812 --> 20:37.579
Hi!

20:37.647 --> 20:40.015
Hey, little man.

20:40.083 --> 20:41.283
I didn't know you guys
lived around here.

20:41.351 --> 20:42.784
Yeah, we're just a couple
blocks away.

20:42.852 --> 20:44.086
Is your mom around?

20:44.153 --> 20:45.220
Uh, no.

20:45.288 --> 20:46.688
She's actually out
grocery shopping,

20:46.756 --> 20:48.023
but she should be back soon
if you want to wait for her.

20:48.091 --> 20:48.757
Yeah, sure.

20:48.825 --> 20:52.027
Take a seat.

20:52.095 --> 20:55.597
So my mom said you guys met
at that grief counseling group.

20:55.665 --> 20:57.032
Yeah, yeah we did.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.400
Listen, thanks for telling me
about that group.

20:58.468 --> 21:00.335
Yeah.

21:00.403 --> 21:02.971
You know, it's really hard
to talk about that stuff

21:03.039 --> 21:03.705
in front of Ben,

21:03.773 --> 21:06.208
he's just so sensitive.

21:06.275 --> 21:08.076
Oh.

21:08.144 --> 21:09.544
I didn't know you were here,

21:09.612 --> 21:11.113
or I would have brought you
a coffee.

21:11.180 --> 21:12.147
Oh, that's alright,
I'll just drink hers.

21:12.215 --> 21:16.785
She's not gonna miss it.

21:16.853 --> 21:18.320
So what's his name?

21:18.388 --> 21:20.088
Max.

21:20.156 --> 21:21.323
What's wrong with him?

21:21.391 --> 21:22.324
Old age.

21:22.392 --> 21:23.458
It happens to the best of us.

21:23.526 --> 21:24.559
Really?

21:24.627 --> 21:25.694
He sounds more asthmatic
to me.

21:25.762 --> 21:26.995
You should get him
checked out.

21:27.063 --> 21:28.096
Wow.

21:28.164 --> 21:29.398
You should be a vet.

21:29.465 --> 21:31.333
Well, I'm trying to be.

21:31.401 --> 21:32.567
I hope you have good grades.

21:32.635 --> 21:34.336
Yeah, I'm trying to do that,
too.

21:34.404 --> 21:35.704
But physics is really
killing me.

21:35.772 --> 21:40.175
I gotta study every night
if I just want to pass.

21:40.243 --> 21:42.444
So was my mom expecting you,
or...?

21:42.512 --> 21:44.246
No, this is just a random
drop by.

21:44.313 --> 21:46.415
You know, after what
I've been through

21:46.482 --> 21:47.883
and what she's going through

21:47.950 --> 21:49.584
I thought maybe
I could provide

21:49.652 --> 21:50.986
a bit of a road map for her,
you know?

21:51.054 --> 21:53.689
Oh.

21:53.756 --> 21:57.926
It's been eight months for you,
is that right?

21:57.994 --> 22:03.799
246 days to be exact.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.200
Yeah, mom's not
really doing so well.

22:05.268 --> 22:09.404
She kinda just hangs around
at the house.

22:09.472 --> 22:13.975
Well, you know Ariel, people
grieve in their own ways.

22:14.043 --> 22:15.944
Yeah, I guess.

22:16.012 --> 22:18.914
[car engine sounds]

22:21.017 --> 22:24.052
Hey!

22:24.120 --> 22:25.320
Hey, you two.

22:25.388 --> 22:27.089
Hope you don't mind me
just popping by.

22:27.156 --> 22:28.690
I had a great conversation
with your daughter.

22:28.758 --> 22:31.359
Oh, I didn't realize you
lived so close.

22:31.427 --> 22:33.061
Yeah, they're just
up the street.

22:33.129 --> 22:34.930
Can I give you a hand
with the groceries?

22:35.031 --> 22:36.898
Um, that'd be very nice.

22:36.966 --> 22:38.366
Ok.

22:42.672 --> 22:43.872
Wow.

22:43.940 --> 22:45.240
What're you doing,
feeding the Olympic team?

22:45.308 --> 22:48.410
Hey, Adam brought you a
coffee but I drank it for you.

22:48.478 --> 22:50.178
Oh, that was nice of you.

22:50.246 --> 22:52.047
You need a hand
with all this stuff?

22:52.115 --> 22:53.048
Nah, we're good.

22:53.116 --> 22:53.982
Just have a seat.

22:54.050 --> 22:55.117
Ok.

22:55.184 --> 23:00.122
Mom, you bought dad's
hot sauce again.

23:00.189 --> 23:03.692
Do you want me to just
put it in the fridge, or...?

23:11.601 --> 23:14.770
It takes some time
getting used to it.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.873
Being single again.

23:21.611 --> 23:25.614
I'm not very good at this.

23:25.681 --> 23:29.551
I liked being a couple,
you know?

23:29.652 --> 23:31.286
I knew what my life was about,

23:31.354 --> 23:34.689
about hot sauce and
medical appointments.

23:34.757 --> 23:37.225
It's alright,
we'll figure it out.

23:42.231 --> 23:45.233
Ben's having a hard time coping.

23:45.301 --> 23:48.804
I thought a change of scenery
would help,

23:48.871 --> 23:52.374
but he's had a real difficult
time losing his mom.

23:52.475 --> 23:53.308
Difficult how?

23:53.376 --> 23:57.012
Like, in school or something?

23:57.079 --> 24:01.383
I think he's suffering
from psychological stress.

24:01.450 --> 24:03.819
I'd sleep a lot better if he was
living at home with me.

24:03.886 --> 24:05.153
He didn't want to live at home?

24:05.221 --> 24:06.354
No.

24:06.422 --> 24:08.657
In fact, he was adamant
about staying on campus.

24:08.724 --> 24:10.458
More freedom, you know.

24:10.526 --> 24:11.927
Yeah.

24:15.531 --> 24:16.798
Ok.

24:16.866 --> 24:19.734
I'm going to take Ariel's advice
and get Max to the vet.

24:19.802 --> 24:21.770
Take him to Cam's clinic.

24:21.838 --> 24:23.705
Oh yeah, my uncle's a vet,
you should take him there.

24:23.773 --> 24:26.041
That's ok, the clinic
next to me takes walk-ins.

24:26.108 --> 24:27.576
Okay.

24:27.643 --> 24:30.612
I got this, I was trained well,
I take my own garbage.

24:30.680 --> 24:31.646
See you, Ariel.

24:31.714 --> 24:33.081
Bye.

24:38.588 --> 24:42.357
Hello, Max.

24:42.425 --> 24:44.559
You and I are gonna go
to the vet.

24:44.627 --> 24:45.694
Ok?

24:52.268 --> 24:54.536
Dana, it's none of my business,

24:54.637 --> 24:56.905
but Ariel mentioned she's
having trouble in school.

24:56.973 --> 24:57.806
Really?

24:57.874 --> 24:59.107
She told me she's doing fine.

24:59.208 --> 25:00.675
Apparently not.

25:00.743 --> 25:02.177
It sounded like she needed
more time to study

25:02.245 --> 25:04.512
but was feeling obligated to
come home on the weekends

25:04.580 --> 25:06.448
to keep you company.

25:06.515 --> 25:07.983
I had no idea.

25:08.050 --> 25:09.784
I'll see ya.

25:18.794 --> 25:20.128
Hey!

25:20.196 --> 25:21.897
Uh, so you want to go get
a mani-pedi or something?

25:21.964 --> 25:23.498
Or go see a movie?

25:23.566 --> 25:25.834
There's a few good ones out.

25:25.902 --> 25:27.903
You know what, honey?

25:27.970 --> 25:30.739
Would you mind if we skipped
this weekend?

25:30.806 --> 25:32.974
What, you don't want to get
a mani-pedi with me?

25:33.042 --> 25:34.209
No, it's not that,

25:34.277 --> 25:37.913
I just think maybe I could use
some alone time.

25:37.980 --> 25:40.582
Yeah, ok, sure.
That's fine.

25:40.650 --> 25:42.117
And, you know, it
would give you a chance

25:42.184 --> 25:43.652
to catch up on your studies.

25:43.719 --> 25:45.287
You hardly brought any books
home this weekend.

25:45.354 --> 25:45.987
Yeah, that's true.

25:46.055 --> 25:48.089
I need to do that.

25:48.157 --> 25:49.858
Hey, you ok?

25:49.926 --> 25:52.794
Yeah, I just feel like crap
all of a sudden.

25:52.862 --> 25:56.765
The flu's going around,
I think I may have gotten it.

25:56.832 --> 25:57.966
Well, do you want to go
lay down?

25:58.034 --> 25:59.234
You feel pretty warm.

25:59.302 --> 26:00.402
Uh, no actually.

26:00.469 --> 26:02.470
Can you just drive me back
to school?

26:02.538 --> 26:03.638
Yeah, of course.

26:03.706 --> 26:05.540
Ok, thank you.

26:08.077 --> 26:17.752
[Whistling]

26:17.820 --> 26:19.220
No, I think that's a good idea,
honey.

26:19.288 --> 26:21.723
I do.

26:21.791 --> 26:23.058
Ok, well why don't you
just check in with me

26:23.125 --> 26:25.493
before you go to bed, ok?

26:25.561 --> 26:27.195
Ok, bye bye.

26:35.538 --> 26:36.371
Hi!

26:36.439 --> 26:38.707
Hi.

26:38.774 --> 26:41.376
I just thought no sense in us
both wasting our gas.

26:41.444 --> 26:42.410
You going to group tonight?

26:42.478 --> 26:43.611
I am.

26:43.679 --> 26:45.613
Hop aboard.

26:45.681 --> 26:47.449
Well, that was very thoughtful
of you.

26:51.053 --> 26:52.454
Evening, folks.

26:52.521 --> 26:55.623
Hey, Cameron,
what're you doing here?

26:55.691 --> 26:59.561
I left work early to drive you
to your meeting.

26:59.628 --> 27:02.397
Apparently you've made
other plans.

27:02.465 --> 27:05.567
Adam was kind enough
to offer me a lift.

27:05.634 --> 27:08.703
And I do have my own car,
you know.

27:08.771 --> 27:10.805
Adam, this is Cameron,
my brother-in-law.

27:10.873 --> 27:12.140
Jack's brother.

27:12.208 --> 27:14.242
Cameron.

27:14.310 --> 27:15.610
Hello.

27:17.980 --> 27:20.015
I'll see you later, Cam.

27:27.790 --> 27:28.623
Sorry.

27:28.691 --> 27:29.691
I hope you like country music.

27:29.759 --> 27:30.892
You kiddin' me?

27:30.960 --> 27:33.928
Is there a Southern girl
who didn't?

27:33.996 --> 27:37.098
My daughter, she loves it
even more than I do.

[country music playing

27:46.308 --> 27:53.848
Dana, what would you say if
we went for dinner instead?

27:53.916 --> 27:56.184
Adam, I don't really think
that's appropriate.

27:56.252 --> 28:00.188
I know, I'm not trying
to come on to you.

28:00.256 --> 28:06.327
It's Karen's birthday today,
the first since...

28:06.395 --> 28:07.529
<i>I thought it would help.</i>

28:07.596 --> 28:11.499
<i>I don't feel like being
in a group.</i>

28:11.567 --> 28:14.069
It would be doing me
a favour.

28:26.182 --> 28:29.217
Thank you for doing this,
it's almost over.

28:29.285 --> 28:30.051
I should thank you.

28:30.119 --> 28:31.453
The food here is amazing!

28:31.520 --> 28:32.821
It's unbelievable.

28:32.888 --> 28:36.157
Jack and I didn't really
get out much in the last year.

28:36.225 --> 28:37.192
Here.

28:37.259 --> 28:39.794
Oh, no. No more for me.

28:39.862 --> 28:43.264
This happens to be the finest
wine in the region.

28:43.332 --> 28:44.432
You see those grapes
out there?

28:44.500 --> 28:46.000
Squished in this bottle.

28:46.068 --> 28:46.768
They died for us?

28:46.836 --> 28:47.702
They died for us.

28:47.770 --> 28:49.370
Ok, one drop.

28:49.438 --> 28:51.439
What a sacrifice.

28:51.507 --> 28:52.540
That's good.

28:52.641 --> 28:54.109
Ok.

28:54.176 --> 28:57.045
I can't remember the last time
I had more than a glass.

28:57.113 --> 28:59.214
Yeah, well we tend to give up
a number of things

28:59.281 --> 29:02.851
when we have spouses
who are ill.

29:02.918 --> 29:06.821
I suppose that's true.

29:06.889 --> 29:09.424
So you never did tell me...

29:09.492 --> 29:11.126
how did Karen die?

29:14.797 --> 29:18.766
Well, Karen had a number
of issues.

29:18.834 --> 29:25.573
Stomach infections, joint
inflammation, kidney trouble.

29:25.641 --> 29:31.446
I took care of her and Ben
through most of our marriage.

29:31.514 --> 29:34.883
Dana, I haven't...

29:34.950 --> 29:36.484
I haven't told very many
people this,

29:36.552 --> 29:38.319
but Karen died of an overdose.

29:41.557 --> 29:44.192
I'm so sorry.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.060

29:46.128 --> 29:49.931
She took so many pills,
Dana, it was...

29:49.999 --> 29:51.566
she would take all her pills
and then she would forget

29:51.634 --> 29:53.601
she took them and then
she would take more.

29:53.669 --> 29:58.540
And I would try to warn her,
but...

29:58.607 --> 30:01.576
I was, um...

30:01.644 --> 30:05.013
I was working the night shift,
and I came home in the morning

30:05.080 --> 30:09.083
and Ben was in the living room
watching game shows,

30:09.151 --> 30:14.489
so I went into the bedroom,

30:14.557 --> 30:16.424
and I didn't know that
she wasn't sleeping

30:16.492 --> 30:20.795
until I kissed her.

30:20.863 --> 30:23.131
And then I just sat
on the edge of the bed

30:23.199 --> 30:27.001
and I thought...

30:27.069 --> 30:29.137
<i>"my wife is dead".</i>

30:35.678 --> 30:37.078
Dana, are you ok?

30:37.146 --> 30:41.449

to my head.

weird, actually.

talk about your mom much.

was always there for me.

since I was, like, ten.

He took off when I was little.

33:25.114 --> 33:26.447
Never left a forwarding address

33:26.515 --> 33:31.519

sent one either.

really hard growing up

until the very end.

get each other.

33:56.678 --> 33:58.579
It makes sense
that it's been rough.

Adam told me you'd been having
trouble adjusting to college

with your mom and everything,

34:04.453 --> 34:05.453
that's terrible.

say about me?

34:07.823 --> 34:09.190
Um, nothing.

Just that you were having
trouble adjusting to school.

was like 45 minutes away

51:29.931 --> 51:32.766
Well, she is in college, so...

51:32.834 --> 51:34.968

you've uncorked the wine

01:00:53.093 --> 01:00:55.628
It's ok.

01:00:55.696 --> 01:00:56.796
Alright, you just rest.

01:00:56.864 --> 01:00:58.564
Focus on yourself.

01:01:17.851 --> 01:01:18.985
Uh, why was your phone off?

01:01:19.053 --> 01:01:20.119
It wasn't.

01:01:20.187 --> 01:01:21.754
Well, it went straight
to voice mail.

01:01:25.826 --> 01:01:27.360
She doesn't need
an ambulance.

01:01:49.316 --> 01:01:51.350
Hey, are you done
with this tray here?

01:02:31.692 --> 01:02:32.959
Hey!

01:02:33.026 --> 01:02:34.927
You're still here.

01:02:34.995 --> 01:02:36.963
Uh, yeah, I wanted to do
the dishes for her

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:41.634
before I left.

01:02:41.735 --> 01:02:42.368
How's she doing?

01:02:42.436 --> 01:02:43.636
Oh, she's resting.

01:02:43.704 --> 01:02:44.770
She's good.

01:02:44.838 --> 01:02:47.039
Good. Ok.

01:02:47.107 --> 01:02:49.976
Well, I'm gonna go,
so um...

01:02:50.043 --> 01:02:51.811
tell her I love her and
I'll talk to her later.

01:02:51.879 --> 01:02:52.345
Ok.

01:02:52.412 --> 01:02:53.813
Ok.

01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:55.615
Excuse me.

01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:23.309
[Phone Ringing]

01:03:23.377 --> 01:03:24.610

You've reached Dana Morgan.</i>

01:03:24.678 --> 01:03:25.678
<i>I can't come to the phone
right now...</i>

01:03:25.746 --> 01:03:26.546
There's nothing here.

01:03:26.613 --> 01:03:27.480
That's what I'm telling you.

01:03:27.548 --> 01:03:30.816
Check again.

01:03:30.884 --> 01:03:32.251
I have over and over.

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.220
It's egg and potato,
butter, salt...

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:34.820
Are you sure?

01:03:34.888 --> 01:03:37.056
You're sure?

01:03:37.124 --> 01:03:38.591
There's margarine...

01:03:59.446 --> 01:04:01.948
Good morning, sunshine.

01:04:09.223 --> 01:04:14.260
I can't see.

01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:19.365
Something's wrong
with my eyes.

01:04:19.433 --> 01:04:21.667
Last night I couldn't get up
and now I can't see.

01:04:21.735 --> 01:04:23.603
Here, let me help you.

01:04:25.505 --> 01:04:27.607
I made you a nice breakfast.

01:04:27.674 --> 01:04:29.342
Here.

01:04:32.012 --> 01:04:35.581
What's wrong with me?

01:04:35.649 --> 01:04:38.517
This is what grief feels like.

01:04:38.585 --> 01:04:40.453
Here, have some tea.

01:04:41.822 --> 01:04:42.555
I've rested long enough.

01:04:42.656 --> 01:04:43.256
I need to get up.

01:04:43.323 --> 01:04:44.357
No, no, no.

01:04:44.424 --> 01:04:45.825
Shhhh.

01:04:45.892 --> 01:04:47.026
No, stay, stay.

01:04:47.094 --> 01:04:48.861
That's better.

01:04:48.929 --> 01:04:51.998
Look at that nice breakfast,
do you see?

01:04:52.065 --> 01:04:54.867
Don't you want to eat that?

01:04:54.935 --> 01:04:58.004
What have you done to me?

01:04:58.071 --> 01:05:00.439
Where do you keep
your suitcases?

01:05:00.507 --> 01:05:02.241
In the closet?

01:05:06.179 --> 01:05:06.979
Why can't I walk?

01:05:07.047 --> 01:05:10.616
Why do I need my suitcase?

01:05:10.684 --> 01:05:12.885
<i>I got it!</i>

01:05:12.953 --> 01:05:13.719
This is nice.

01:05:13.787 --> 01:05:15.688
Did Jack buy this for you?

01:05:15.756 --> 01:05:16.622
Yes, indeed.

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:18.057
Really.

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:20.192
Ok, it's beautiful.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.529
Answer me!

01:05:23.597 --> 01:05:26.732
I found the most
gorgeous spot.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.335
Waterfront...

01:05:29.403 --> 01:05:31.837
I mean, we were lucky to get it
at the last minute.

01:05:38.645 --> 01:05:44.183
[Cries out]

01:05:44.251 --> 01:05:46.152
You really need
to be resting.

01:05:46.253 --> 01:05:49.121
You should conserve
your energy.

01:05:49.189 --> 01:05:51.857
Do you like to travel
in t-shirts or blouses?

01:05:56.763 --> 01:05:58.998
Where's my...

01:05:59.066 --> 01:06:01.534
where's my phone?

01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:04.136
I just want to talk to Ariel.

01:06:04.204 --> 01:06:08.074
Let's go with t-shirts.

01:06:11.712 --> 01:06:14.580
Ok.

01:06:14.648 --> 01:06:16.682
Who is that for?

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:19.752
Don't you worry, just let me
take care of you.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.654
Adam.

01:06:21.722 --> 01:06:23.055
Adam, this has gone too far.

01:06:23.123 --> 01:06:25.391
I just want my phone.

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:30.696
Oh, that's a nasty rash.

01:06:30.764 --> 01:06:32.665
Is it itchy?

01:06:32.733 --> 01:06:36.802
[Sobbing]
Stop it!

01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:40.005
Is it money you want?

01:06:40.073 --> 01:06:42.241
I don't have any!

01:06:42.342 --> 01:06:43.876
This house is mortgaged
to the hill...

01:06:43.944 --> 01:06:45.811
I have nothing.

01:06:45.879 --> 01:06:50.216
Shhh. You're upset.

01:06:50.283 --> 01:06:52.852
We'll do this later.

01:06:52.919 --> 01:06:54.887
Ok?

01:06:54.955 --> 01:06:57.256
All better.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.869

01:07:09.936 --> 01:07:11.837
Adam!!!!!!!

01:07:31.057 --> 01:07:32.725
Ariel!

01:07:32.793 --> 01:07:34.026
Hey! What's up?

01:07:34.094 --> 01:07:34.927
Hey, how are you?

01:07:34.995 --> 01:07:35.961
Were you going to say goodbye?

01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:37.029
I have to run home
and see my mom,

01:07:37.097 --> 01:07:38.230
but I texted you so...

01:07:38.298 --> 01:07:39.865
Oh yeah, no, sorry I didn't
check them.

01:07:39.933 --> 01:07:41.634
Alright, well just read it,
it'll explain some stuff.

01:07:41.701 --> 01:07:42.468
Oh, ok.

01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:43.202
Ok, bye.

01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:46.939
What's wrong with your eye?

01:07:47.007 --> 01:07:47.706
What?

01:07:47.774 --> 01:07:48.574
Your eye is bleeding.

01:07:48.642 --> 01:07:49.675
What do you mean?

01:07:49.776 --> 01:07:50.843
Oh my god, your eye
is bleeding!

01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:51.444
What?

01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:52.545
Yeah!

01:08:03.089 --> 01:08:04.924
Ok, good news.

01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:07.693
You are one very lucky
young man.

01:08:07.761 --> 01:08:09.595
If that hemorrhage had been
at the back of your retina,

01:08:09.663 --> 01:08:11.130
your friend here never
would have seen it

01:08:11.198 --> 01:08:12.932
and the damage could have
been extensive.

01:08:12.999 --> 01:08:15.401
But not to worry, you've got a
subconjunctival hemorrhage,

01:08:15.469 --> 01:08:16.836
it'll heal by itself.

01:08:16.903 --> 01:08:19.805
Now, what are you
taking ethambutol for?

01:08:19.872 --> 01:08:20.439
Etham what?

01:08:20.506 --> 01:08:21.506
What is that?

01:08:21.575 --> 01:08:23.843
Um, the antibiotic
that you're on.

01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:27.513
I'm not on any antibiotic.

01:08:27.581 --> 01:08:29.281
Ben Woods?

01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:31.716
Your blood work shows that
you're loaded with ethambutol.

01:08:31.785 --> 01:08:35.921
It's what caused
the hemorrhage.

01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:38.323
Um, what is ethambutol
used for?

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:41.393
Well, generally it's for
treating tuberculosis.

01:08:41.461 --> 01:08:45.163
Uh, didn't you say Adam's mother
died of tuberculosis?

01:08:45.232 --> 01:08:47.500
Yeah, so?

01:08:47.567 --> 01:08:52.404
Um... can ethambutol cause
other kinds of eye problems?

01:08:52.471 --> 01:08:54.439
Yeah, unfortunately a fair
number of them:

01:08:54.508 --> 01:08:57.142
double vision,
visual hallucinations...

01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:59.011
Like tunnel vision
and colour blindness?

01:08:59.078 --> 01:09:01.814
Deuteranopia, red-green
colour blindness and schitomas,

01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:03.082
blind spots in the field
of vision...

01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:04.550
they're pretty common
side effects,

01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:06.285
especially in patients that have
been taking as high of doses

01:09:06.353 --> 01:09:08.354
as Ben was on.

01:09:08.421 --> 01:09:09.921
Alright, hang on a second.

01:09:10.023 --> 01:09:11.390
Am I to understand that you
were not taking

01:09:11.457 --> 01:09:14.359
this medication voluntarily?

01:09:14.426 --> 01:09:15.426
No.

01:09:15.495 --> 01:09:16.495
His stepfather
was drugging him.

01:09:16.563 --> 01:09:17.729
What?

01:09:17.796 --> 01:09:20.198
Yeah, he's drugging my mom,
too.

01:09:20.267 --> 01:09:22.067
Oh my god, oh my god
I knew it.

01:09:22.135 --> 01:09:24.303
Who else would be giving you
a tuberculosis drug?!

01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:26.171
Alright you two, I don't know
what's going on here

01:09:26.238 --> 01:09:27.606
but it sounds to me like the
police need to be involved.

01:09:27.674 --> 01:09:30.276
Yeah, his name
is Adam Smith,

01:09:30.343 --> 01:09:32.011
he's at 329 Birch Avenue.

01:09:32.078 --> 01:09:33.212
Tell them to hurry!

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:34.546
Excuse me, sorry!

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.453
(Children): Trick or treat!

01:09:47.327 --> 01:09:48.627
Hey!

01:09:48.694 --> 01:09:49.828
Look, I don't understand
why you won't put out an alert

01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:51.063
when he's obviously
taken her somewhere!

01:09:51.131 --> 01:09:52.331
You saw the note.

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:54.166
Your mother said they went
away for some R&R.

01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:55.668
Yeah, but that's not even
her handwriting!

01:09:55.735 --> 01:09:56.835
And she would never go away
with him!

01:09:56.903 --> 01:09:58.070
She just met him!

01:09:58.138 --> 01:09:59.939
There's no sign of abduction
in this house,

01:10:00.006 --> 01:10:01.840
no sign of force being used.

01:10:01.908 --> 01:10:02.975
You want me to put out an APB

01:10:03.043 --> 01:10:04.810
without any evidence of a crime.

01:10:04.878 --> 01:10:07.212
No, I told you there's evidence
he drugged Ben!

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.281
I told you that.

01:10:09.349 --> 01:10:11.417
Your boyfriend lives
on campus?

01:10:11.484 --> 01:10:12.451
Yeah.

01:10:12.519 --> 01:10:13.619
Another student drugged
him as...

01:10:13.687 --> 01:10:15.120
No! That's ridiculous!

01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:16.855
It's not ridiculous, it's what
Smith's lawyer's gonna say

01:10:16.923 --> 01:10:18.991
if I haul him in with nothing!

01:10:19.059 --> 01:10:20.759
Here's my card.

01:10:20.827 --> 01:10:21.860
Cell's on the back.

01:10:21.928 --> 01:10:24.630
Call me if you get
something solid.

01:10:28.435 --> 01:10:29.702
Thank you.

01:10:29.769 --> 01:10:33.405
I'll check back in and make sure
I talk to both of them.

01:10:33.473 --> 01:10:34.907
Ok.

01:10:34.975 --> 01:10:36.342
<i>It's gonna be ok.</i>

01:10:38.211 --> 01:10:39.578
Good night.

01:10:48.288 --> 01:10:49.021
Hey.

01:10:49.089 --> 01:10:49.989
Hey.

01:10:50.056 --> 01:10:51.523
Look, we're gonna find her.

01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:55.027
How are we gonna find her?

01:10:55.095 --> 01:10:57.096
Come sit down.

01:11:05.405 --> 01:11:08.474
Are you looking for the guy who
always hangs around your house?

01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:10.542
Yeah, have you seen him?

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:13.445
He left this morning with your
mom, in his convertible.

01:11:13.546 --> 01:11:14.747
He had a blue suitcase.

01:11:14.814 --> 01:11:16.115
Do you know where they went?

01:11:22.989 --> 01:11:25.224
I had to bury his dog
for him.

01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:26.725
His dog died?

01:11:26.793 --> 01:11:31.230
I thought he was sleeping,
but he was stiff.

01:11:31.297 --> 01:11:32.931
Your name's Brooks,
right?

01:11:32.999 --> 01:11:34.633
Yeah.

01:11:34.701 --> 01:11:36.702
Can you show me
where you buried the dog?

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:39.672
He's under that mound
over there.

01:11:55.488 --> 01:11:59.658
Hey.

01:11:59.726 --> 01:12:03.262
I'm sorry.

01:12:03.329 --> 01:12:06.765
They found traces of ethembutol
in the dog's bloodstream.

01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:11.603
Hey, come on.

01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:14.106
I want to show you something.

01:12:14.174 --> 01:12:16.442
Come on.

01:12:16.509 --> 01:12:18.644
Ethembutol has a lot more side
effects than just eye problems.

01:12:18.712 --> 01:12:20.679
Look: excessive tiredness,
nausea, disorientation,

01:12:20.747 --> 01:12:22.347
visual and audio hallucinations,

01:12:22.415 --> 01:12:26.351
trouble breathing and death.

01:12:26.419 --> 01:12:28.887
Hey, uh... where was
your mother buried?

01:12:28.955 --> 01:12:32.725
Um, her death was attributed
to an overdose, painkillers.

01:12:32.792 --> 01:12:35.094
Adam had her cremated.

01:12:41.067 --> 01:12:43.535
Um... uh, what
about his first wife?

01:12:43.603 --> 01:12:44.369
Do you know her name?

01:12:44.437 --> 01:12:45.237
What was her name?

01:12:45.305 --> 01:12:45.938
Miss Texas?

01:12:46.005 --> 01:12:46.739
No, um...

01:12:46.806 --> 01:12:47.339
Libby.

01:12:47.407 --> 01:12:48.207
Libby something.

01:12:48.274 --> 01:12:49.108
Libby Miss Texas.

01:12:49.175 --> 01:12:50.609
Here.

01:12:50.677 --> 01:12:52.945
1997 Miss Texas,
Elizabeth Schuster.

01:12:53.012 --> 01:12:53.812
She could be a Libby, right?

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.847
Yeah, try that.

01:12:54.914 --> 01:12:58.016
Ok, Elizabeth Schuster...

01:12:58.084 --> 01:12:59.318
Woah, what are we
looking for?

01:12:59.419 --> 01:13:03.522
Just anything that leads
them to Adam.

01:13:03.623 --> 01:13:04.890
I can't read that fast!

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:06.759
It's ok, it's alright,
I'm reading it, it's fine.

01:13:06.826 --> 01:13:09.762
Elizabeth Bennet,
Dallas Texas.

01:13:09.829 --> 01:13:10.629
What is Deadly Union?

01:13:10.697 --> 01:13:12.264
What is that?

01:13:12.365 --> 01:13:13.766
Oh my god, that's Adam!

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:17.936
Oh my god.

01:13:18.004 --> 01:13:20.472
Uh, Patrick Adamson
was acquitted

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.041
of attempted murder yesterday.

01:13:26.079 --> 01:13:27.813
The trial took so long primarily
due to past evidence

01:13:27.914 --> 01:13:29.348
of complaints from Bennet,

01:13:29.415 --> 01:13:32.217
the controversial Munchausen
by Proxy case,

01:13:32.285 --> 01:13:33.252
I don't know what that is,

01:13:33.319 --> 01:13:34.553
has rocked Texas
since last summer

01:13:34.621 --> 01:13:37.189
when the former Miss Texas
accused her new husband

01:13:37.257 --> 01:13:41.460
of poisoning her breakfast tea.

01:13:41.528 --> 01:13:43.862
Perpetrator was a fabricator
that caused illnesses in other--

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:45.330
Potentially lethal?

01:13:45.398 --> 01:13:47.199
-- seen a way of obtaining love.

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.902
Symptoms, what symptoms?

01:13:49.969 --> 01:13:52.771
Every time I came home, Adam was
always making tea for my mom.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.309
Oh my god, Adam's insane.

01:13:57.377 --> 01:13:58.243
What's going on?

01:13:58.311 --> 01:13:59.845
He's poisoning them.

01:13:59.913 --> 01:14:02.948
I'm going to call
the detective, ok?

01:14:03.016 --> 01:14:04.283
Um...

01:14:08.621 --> 01:14:09.555
Hi, Detective Harcroft?

01:14:09.622 --> 01:14:11.890
It's Ariel Morgan.

01:14:11.958 --> 01:14:13.959
Uh, you're gonna want
to put out that APB.

01:14:22.135 --> 01:14:26.338
Can you please just take me
to the hospital?

01:14:26.406 --> 01:14:28.774
My hands and my feet
are on fire.

01:14:31.244 --> 01:14:32.411
Here.

01:14:32.478 --> 01:14:34.913
Drink your wellness tea.

01:14:34.981 --> 01:14:35.814
Look where you are.

01:14:35.882 --> 01:14:36.882
Isn't that beautiful?

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:41.653
Fresh air's gonna do you good.

01:14:41.754 --> 01:14:44.790
It's in there, isn't it?

01:14:44.858 --> 01:14:48.660
What you've been giving me.

01:14:48.728 --> 01:14:52.631
That's why you wanted me to
drink it three times a day.

01:14:52.699 --> 01:14:55.467
Go on.

01:14:55.535 --> 01:14:56.401
I don't want it.

01:14:56.469 --> 01:14:57.336
Go on.

01:14:57.403 --> 01:14:58.570
No!

01:14:58.638 --> 01:15:00.172
[crash sound]

01:15:02.442 --> 01:15:17.856
[Coughing]

01:15:22.128 --> 01:15:25.764
How come you got blood
in your mouth?

01:15:25.832 --> 01:15:27.132
George!

01:15:27.233 --> 01:15:29.868
George!

01:15:29.936 --> 01:15:31.403
Didn't I tell you to stay outta
your momma's room?

01:15:31.471 --> 01:15:33.105
She's sick!

01:15:38.544 --> 01:15:40.178
There, there, darling.

01:15:40.246 --> 01:15:45.651
There's nothing to be
frightened of.

01:15:45.718 --> 01:15:47.886
I love you, momma.

01:15:53.726 --> 01:16:01.867
None of you cared about me
like I cared about you.

01:16:01.935 --> 01:16:04.736
I'm a good boy, momma.

01:16:04.804 --> 01:16:08.540
I'm a good boy.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.213
Where does he get
the ethembutol?

01:16:15.281 --> 01:16:18.417
He must have a supply,
right?

01:16:18.484 --> 01:16:21.219
Maybe the hospital.

01:16:21.287 --> 01:16:24.623
<i>No, he'd never be able to pick
that much up at a time, right?</i>

01:16:24.691 --> 01:16:27.092
<i>What if he's prescribed
ethembutol?</i>

01:16:28.895 --> 01:16:30.696
We gotta call the pharmacies.

01:16:40.974 --> 01:16:45.210
[Screaming]
Help! Somebody!

01:16:45.278 --> 01:16:46.378
Hi, yes, I'm calling
to see

01:16:46.446 --> 01:16:47.312
if a prescription
was purchased for...

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.015
...ethembutol?

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:52.417
Yeah, I'll hold.

01:16:52.485 --> 01:16:53.685
<i>That's right, Smith Adam.</i>

01:16:53.753 --> 01:16:57.055
<i>It's for ethembutol?</i>

01:16:57.123 --> 01:16:58.190
Ok, yeah fine,
I'll try there.

01:16:58.257 --> 01:16:59.658
Thanks, bye.

01:16:59.726 --> 01:17:01.626
Alright, how many more?

01:17:01.694 --> 01:17:03.895
Uh...13

01:17:05.631 --> 01:17:06.498
I don't make a habit
of filling

01:17:06.566 --> 01:17:10.002
out of town doctor's scripts,

01:17:10.069 --> 01:17:14.539
but you being
a nurse and all...

01:17:14.607 --> 01:17:16.942
your wife's on an unusually
high dose.

01:17:17.043 --> 01:17:18.443
The side effects
could be very...

01:17:18.511 --> 01:17:20.178
I'm well versed.

01:17:33.926 --> 01:17:35.293
<i>Hi, yes.</i>

01:17:35.361 --> 01:17:36.628
<i>I'm calling to see if a
prescription was picked up</i>

01:17:36.696 --> 01:17:40.465
<i>this morning for Adam Smith
for ethembutol?</i>

01:17:40.533 --> 01:17:43.635
A Joe Smith?

01:17:43.703 --> 01:17:45.037
Uh huh?

01:17:45.104 --> 01:17:46.405
Yeah, no he probably just
wrote down the name wrong.

01:17:46.472 --> 01:17:50.575
Um, and where did you
say you were located?

01:17:50.643 --> 01:17:52.611
Great, ok, thank you so much!

01:17:52.678 --> 01:17:54.279
A prescription was picked up
this morning for ethembutol

01:17:54.347 --> 01:17:56.915
for a Joe Smith in
uh... Robert's Creek.

01:17:56.983 --> 01:17:58.784
Come on, let's go!

01:18:40.359 --> 01:18:42.494

01:18:42.562 --> 01:18:45.163
Somebody help me!

01:18:45.231 --> 01:18:46.531
<i>Yeah, that's what they said.</i>

01:18:46.599 --> 01:18:48.767
Just keep calling any hotels
or vacation homes,

01:18:48.835 --> 01:18:50.702
anywhere they might be staying.

01:19:07.787 --> 01:19:10.055
Help!

01:19:10.123 --> 01:19:15.227
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

01:19:15.294 --> 01:19:17.062

01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:19.397
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:19:19.465 --> 01:19:22.868
Oh no, god!

01:19:22.935 --> 01:19:24.636
Dana!

01:19:24.704 --> 01:19:26.771

Let me help you!

01:19:41.687 --> 01:19:43.722
I don't trust you!

Please, Dana! Don't do this!

01:19:45.491 --> 01:19:47.459
Come on!

01:19:47.527 --> 01:19:49.194
Come on!

01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:50.795
Ariel told me to come
get you!

01:19:50.863 --> 01:19:53.198
She told me to take care
of you, Dana!

01:19:53.266 --> 01:19:58.103
I don't believe you!

01:19:58.171 --> 01:20:00.438
No!

01:20:00.506 --> 01:20:03.141
Dana!

01:20:03.209 --> 01:20:06.444
Do you have a Dana Morgan
or Joe Smith registered there?

01:20:06.512 --> 01:20:07.546
You do?

01:20:07.613 --> 01:20:08.880
Joe Smith rented
one of your cottages?

01:20:08.948 --> 01:20:10.015
What's the number?
What's the number?

01:20:10.082 --> 01:20:12.350
Um, what's the number there?

01:20:12.418 --> 01:20:13.585
Oh, you don't have one?

01:20:13.653 --> 01:20:16.588
Ok, what is the exact location
of that cottage?

01:20:16.656 --> 01:20:18.490
<i>Dana!</i>

01:20:18.558 --> 01:20:19.791

01:21:02.268 --> 01:21:02.734
She's not here.

01:21:02.802 --> 01:21:04.202
MOM!

01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:06.037
MOM!

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:11.610
Dammit.

01:21:11.677 --> 01:21:12.644
Why is the car still there?

01:21:12.712 --> 01:21:15.046
I know, I know,
they're not here!

01:21:15.114 --> 01:21:16.081
[Distant screams]

01:21:16.148 --> 01:21:17.048
Did you hear that?

01:21:17.116 --> 01:21:17.949
What?

01:21:18.017 --> 01:21:19.684
[Distant screams]

01:21:19.752 --> 01:21:20.285
That, right there!

01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:20.885
The yelling!

01:21:20.953 --> 01:21:21.753
Did you hear it?

01:21:21.821 --> 01:21:22.821
No, I didn't hear anything.

01:21:22.888 --> 01:21:23.855
I think it's coming
from over there.

01:21:23.923 --> 01:21:24.656
Wait for the cops,
just stay here!

01:21:24.724 --> 01:21:25.624

What's going on?

01:21:39.038 --> 01:21:40.205
Where are they?

01:21:40.273 --> 01:21:41.706
I don't know, I think
they went that way.

01:21:41.774 --> 01:21:42.374
Down here.

01:21:42.441 --> 01:21:43.441

01:21:50.716 --> 01:21:51.816
Let her go.

01:21:51.884 --> 01:21:53.118
Your mother's coming
with me.

01:21:53.185 --> 01:21:53.718
She needs me.

01:21:53.786 --> 01:21:55.053
She's sick!

01:21:55.121 --> 01:21:55.887
She's not going anywhere
with you.

01:21:55.955 --> 01:21:57.355
Mom!

01:21:57.423 --> 01:21:59.491
She's sick!

She's coming with me!

01:22:04.730 --> 01:22:05.463
Get off me!

01:22:05.531 --> 01:22:06.498
Get off me!

01:22:06.565 --> 01:22:08.266
Couldn't leave it alone,
could you?

01:22:08.334 --> 01:22:10.468
Can't you see she needs me?!

01:22:10.536 --> 01:22:12.837
I know who you are,
Patrick Adamson.

Got him, right here!

01:22:43.769 --> 01:22:45.170
Stay down, Adamson.

I couldn't find you!

01:22:50.576 --> 01:22:52.444
I love you!

01:22:52.511 --> 01:22:53.745
You found me!

01:23:09.895 --> 01:23:11.429
Let's go, on your feet.

01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:13.031
On your feet!

01:23:18.104 --> 01:23:19.838
Let's go.

01:23:24.076 --> 01:23:27.112
I trusted you.

01:23:27.179 --> 01:23:29.547
I know.

01:24:08.354 --> 01:24:11.656
It's nice for them here,
right?

01:24:11.724 --> 01:24:13.124
Yeah.

01:24:13.192 --> 01:24:17.228
Yeah, it is.

01:24:17.296 --> 01:24:18.730
You know, Uncle Cam might
still be here

01:24:18.798 --> 01:24:24.002
if he wasn't on his heart pills
when he drank Adam's coffee.

01:24:24.069 --> 01:24:27.205
Well, we're never going
to know that for sure.

01:24:27.273 --> 01:24:30.175
Come on.

01:24:32.077 --> 01:24:33.645
So is Ben meeting you
at the house?

01:24:33.712 --> 01:24:38.082
Yeah, we're gonna go
for a walk.

01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:40.018
He doesn't really have
anybody anymore.

01:24:40.085 --> 01:24:45.256
His mom's gone and Adam's...

01:24:45.324 --> 01:24:46.558
at least his eyesight
is coming back.

01:24:46.625 --> 01:24:48.693
That's good.

01:24:48.761 --> 01:24:51.563
He has you.

01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:54.065
And so do I.
