BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING, SIR,

01:33:11.754 --> 01:33:13.956
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER, SIR.

01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:15.257
LOOK,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:17.626
SHE HAS SO MUCH BEAUTY,
SO MUCH HONESTY,

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.628
AND I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

01:33:19.662 --> 01:33:22.497
CARLOS, STOP. NOW,
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:25.333
THANK YOU.

01:33:25.367 --> 01:33:26.802
FOR WHAT?

01:33:26.835 --> 01:33:28.804
FOR NOT LISTENING
TO ME.

01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:30.673
FOR STICKING AROUND.

01:33:30.706 --> 01:33:33.809
ANNAPOLIS IS GONNA BE
LUCKY TO GET YOU.

01:33:33.842 --> 01:33:37.179
BUT I HAD A SPEECH.

01:33:37.212 --> 01:33:38.413
I HAD A PRETTY GOOD SPEECH.

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.282
I BET YOU DID.

01:33:40.315 --> 01:33:41.650
YOU WANT TO HEAR IT
ANYWAYS?

01:33:41.684 --> 01:33:43.318
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL IT TO HER?

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:45.688
SEEMS TO BE DOING
PRETTY GOOD.

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.176
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:10.345
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:12.280
DO WHAT?

01:34:12.314 --> 01:34:15.650
I WASN'T EVEN THERE.

01:34:15.684 --> 01:34:17.720
YES, YOU WERE.

01:34:17.753 --> 01:34:20.188
YOU WERE SO THERE.

01:34:21.323 --> 01:34:24.693
* I WANT TO BELIEVE IN

01:34:27.696 --> 01:34:32.234
* I WANT TO BELIEVE IN US

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:36.171
Nicole: THERE ARE MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:34:36.204 --> 01:34:41.176
BUT, IN THE END,
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ONE.

01:34:43.779 --> 01:34:48.250
I STILL PANIC SOMETIMES,
FORGET TO BREATHE,

01:34:48.283 --> 01:34:50.318
BUT I KNOW...

01:34:50.352 --> 01:34:51.987
I KNOW THERE'S
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:55.223
IN ALL MY IMPERFECTIONS.

01:34:55.257 --> 01:34:59.261
A BEAUTY WHICH HE HELD UP
FOR ME TO SEE.

01:34:59.294 --> 01:35:02.230
A STRENGTH THAT CAN
NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:08.203
I'M GOING OUT TO SEE HIM
NEXT WEEK...

01:35:08.236 --> 01:35:09.604
BUT UNTIL THEN...

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:13.241
THERE'S ONE PHOTO
I KEEP WITH ME ALL THE TIME.

01:35:13.275 --> 01:35:16.144
* I BELIEVE IN US

01:35:23.285 --> 01:35:27.255
* EVERYONE FALLS

01:35:27.289 --> 01:35:32.260
* BUT NOT EVERYONE RISES

01:35:32.294 --> 01:35:35.230
* WHY DON'T YOU GET UP

01:35:36.398 --> 01:35:40.735
* AND RISE AGAIN FOR ME

01:35:40.769 --> 01:35:45.373
* WHAT IF THE WORLD
WERE A LITTLE MORE PERFECT *

01:35:45.407 --> 01:35:47.609
* WOULD YOU STOP CRYING

01:35:47.642 --> 01:35:50.145
* WOULD YOU TAKE THE LEAP

01:35:50.178 --> 01:35:54.282
* NOW, WHAT IF THE WORLD
WERE A LITTLE MORE PERFECT *

01:35:54.316 --> 01:35:58.386
* WOULD YOU OPEN YOUR EYES

01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:02.157
* AND BLINK AGAIN FOR ME

01:36:03.658 --> 01:36:07.395
* FOR ME

01:36:07.429 --> 01:36:10.165
* YEAH, FOR ME

01:36:16.304 --> 01:36:20.308
* WHAT ABOUT FRIENDSHIP

01:36:20.342 --> 01:36:23.311
* WHAT ABOUT FRIENDS

01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:29.417
* YOU SAID THE WHOLE WORLD
WAS AGAINST YOU *

01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:32.354
* IT ALL HAD TO END

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:37.960
* WHAT ABOUT LOVE

01:36:37.993 --> 01:36:42.464
* WHAT ABOUT FAMILY

01:36:42.497 --> 01:36:49.371
* WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT
YOU HAVE TO LIVE FOR *

01:36:51.406 --> 01:36:56.211
* WHAT IF THE WORLD WERE
A LITTLE MORE PERFECT *

01:36:56.244 --> 01:36:58.280
* WOULD YOU STOP CRYING

01:36:58.313 --> 01:37:00.782
* WOULD YOU TAKE THE LEAP

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:05.187
* WHAT IF THE WORLD WERE
A LITTLE MORE PERFECT *

01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.656
* WOULD YOU OPEN YOUR EYES

01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:12.760
* AND BLINK AGAIN FOR ME

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:17.332
* FOR ME

01:37:17.365 --> 01:37:21.336
* AND BLINK AGAIN FOR ME

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:26.508
* FOR ME

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:31.213
* IT ISN'T EASY
HERE WITHOUT YOU *

01:37:31.246 --> 01:37:33.748
* WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME

01:37:35.417 --> 01:37:38.186
* WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:45.260
* WITHOUT YOU

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:53.701
* WITHOUT YOU

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:06.448
* AND WHAT IF THE WORLD
WERE A LITTLE MORE PERFECT *

01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:08.550
* WOULD YOU STOP CRYING

01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:11.353
* WOULD YOU TAKE THE LEAP

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:15.290
* WHAT IF THE WORLD WERE
A LITTLE MORE PERFECT *

01:38:15.323 --> 01:38:19.294
* WOULD YOU OPEN YOUR EYES

01:38:19.327 --> 01:38:24.266
* AND WHAT IF THE WORLD
WERE A LITTLE MORE PERFECT *

01:38:24.299 --> 01:38:26.268
* WOULD YOU STOP CRYING

01:38:26.301 --> 01:38:28.570
* WOULD YOU TAKE THE LEAP

01:38:28.603 --> 01:38:32.807
* WHAT IF THE WORLD WERE
A LITTLE MORE PERFECT *

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.778
* COULD YOU OPEN YOUR EYES

01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:41.416
* AND BLINK AGAIN FOR ME

01:38:42.417 --> 01:38:44.786
* FOR ME

01:38:44.819 --> 01:38:46.388
* OOH

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:50.258
* FOR ME

01:38:50.292 --> 01:38:52.294
* FOR ME, FOR ME
