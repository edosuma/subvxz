(Lena)
Previously...

00:47.080 --> 00:49.516
<i>So it turns out I'm stuck</i>
<i>in a time bubble.</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:53.654
<i>Henri and Oscar are working</i>
<i>together to try and figure out</i>
<i>how to get me out of here.</i>

00:53.687 --> 00:56.222
It's a portal. It
can penetrate the bubble
Lena's in.

00:56.256 --> 00:59.660
In the meantime, things got
a bit weird when Max and I
danced La Fée together.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.461
You know, because of
the legend.

01:01.494 --> 01:03.229
Those that dance the
roles fall for each other.

01:03.263 --> 01:06.833
It's time to set things
straight between us.
-(Lena) I wish you were
here.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.684
(classical piano music
plays)

01:33.226 --> 01:37.598
Pst! What's going on
with y'all? Why are you guys
acting so weird?

01:37.631 --> 01:42.102
(Etienne) OK! That's
it for today. But don't get
too excited.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.672
That may be it for
today, but I have a weekend
assignment for you.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.742
(Jeff sighs)
-The last thing you want to be
is a lazy ballet dancer.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.545
So you can thank
me for keeping you
fresh.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.247
(scoffs) Fresh
or totally
overworked.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.882
Pardon me, Mr
Chase?

01:55.916 --> 01:59.285
Oh, man. Why do I get the
feeling I always say the wrong
thing at the wrong time?

01:59.319 --> 02:00.787
Because you
do.

02:01.588 --> 02:04.558
(Etienne) As I was
saying... I want you and
your partner

02:04.591 --> 02:08.261
to create a hybrid of
ballet and any other kind
of dance.

02:08.662 --> 02:12.498
(Etienne)
Anything. Get creative.
Wow me.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.736
You will lose
points if I'm bored.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.271
Class
dismissed.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.574
Good
afternoon, ladies
and gents!

02:20.607 --> 02:24.611
Sure, it's the weekend
and these wicked dancers should
be on top of the world.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.381
But no. Surely
something else is going on.

02:28.414 --> 02:32.152
This is teen
politics at its finest,
folks.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.723
Jeff, do you always
have to be so on? It's super
annoying.

02:36.757 --> 02:41.427
(scoffs) Dash and Ines can't
seem to find their groove,
since he really likes her

02:41.461 --> 02:46.266
and she... well, it's possible
she doesn't like anybody at
all.

02:46.299 --> 02:50.236
(Jeff) Woop! Ah! Hm...
(hums)

02:50.904 --> 02:52.739
Ha, don't worry,
girl.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.976
I got so much game,
you're gonna wonder how it
wasn't me who won Dance Off,
instead of you.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.579
(scoffs) Dream on.
Hm.

02:58.612 --> 03:03.249
But... nobody can top
what's going on with these
two.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.251
(Lena
gasps)

03:05.285 --> 03:06.452
(clears his throat)
-What?

03:06.486 --> 03:11.592
It's called
chemistreeeee! Yeah! Like
"tree" you know?

03:11.625 --> 03:14.427
Hit me up top! Oh...
OK...

03:15.328 --> 03:21.502
Ines! You're a
scientist! We are on the verge
of a chemical explosion here!

03:21.535 --> 03:23.203
(Lena
grunts)

03:23.637 --> 03:26.673
(Jeff) Max!
(Max) Too far,
Jeff.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.876
(Jeff) Thea! Well,
what...

03:29.910 --> 03:33.013
Did I?
(Sighs)

03:33.046 --> 03:35.816
What was that?
-What? It's the truth.

03:35.849 --> 03:41.555
Well, what's also the
truth is that Thea is Max's
girlfriend. Not Lena. Nice one,
Jeff.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.961
Oh no... That
girl's gonna kill me.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.605
(car horn honks,
bicycle bell
rings)

04:04.611 --> 04:06.947
OK, this is a disaster.
What do you think I should
do?

04:06.980 --> 04:10.817
Dude, I have no idea.
I don't really get caught up
in all the drama around
here.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.688
Well, why did Jeff say
that? I mean... It's obviously
not true, right?

04:14.721 --> 04:15.789
Well...

04:16.723 --> 04:18.925
What do you mean,
weellll?

04:18.959 --> 04:21.394
I mean... he does
seem to kinda like you.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.898
It's pretty obvi.
And it's not the first time
it's come up, either.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.268
I need
answers from the
magic box.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.909
I keep forgetting that
part. Thank you. Okay. Let's
do this.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.814
(reads) "Ten Signs A
Boy Likes You."

04:44.785 --> 04:49.756
See? No. I knew it
wasn't true. You're all wrong.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.993
Max never does any of
these things, so clearly he
doesn't like me like that.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.562
Yeah, I'm sure that
list is super accurate.

04:55.596 --> 05:01.535
Listen. He's never
brought me flowers, never asked
me to go to the movies.

05:01.968 --> 05:06.406
And he never ever asks
me to "hang out". What does
that even mean?

05:06.439 --> 05:08.909
Anyway, even if he did,
I'd say no because I have a
boyfriend.

05:09.710 --> 05:14.848
Remember? Henri.
Plus, like I've already
said, I don't like him like
that.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.583
Yeah? Are you sure
about that?

05:16.617 --> 05:20.921
Have I ever dropped
my handkerchief for him? Or
handed him a conversation
card?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.623
I've got to hear
this...

05:24.157 --> 05:27.994
It's how we do it in
1905. It's this delightful card
with a humorous note.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.430
Like a text. Although
it doesn't say that on
here.

05:30.463 --> 05:31.898
Yeah, I don't
think it's gonna be
on...

05:31.932 --> 05:35.001
What am I suppose to
do? We have to work on the
assignment all weekend

05:35.035 --> 05:37.037
and I don't want to
give him the wrong idea.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.506
Oh, I
know...

05:40.874 --> 05:43.043
(Ines) Of course... a
letter.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.957
(Oscar
grunts)

05:58.458 --> 06:00.794
I got a letter...
from Lena!

06:01.562 --> 06:02.996
No way...
How?

06:04.698 --> 06:07.734
We used to hide letters
for each other in this loose
brick on the roof of the
Garnier.

06:08.168 --> 06:11.071
She put it there,
and somehow... I got
it!

06:11.104 --> 06:14.841
Whoa. I thought they
only traveled from the past to
the future,

06:14.875 --> 06:18.745
not the other way
around. That's the power of
love, man.

06:19.112 --> 06:23.984
I need your help. If we
can build this portal, I can
go get the girl I love.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.787
That's an excellent idea, kid.
-Thank you.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.691
One question. How
exactly are you going to build
the portal?

06:32.626 --> 06:36.530
I may not have all
the answers yet. I need to
talk to my father.

06:36.563 --> 06:40.634
But I'm gonna get
her back. No matter what
it takes.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.879
Hey, T.

06:54.380 --> 06:58.919
Hm?
-Sorry. You know, Max and Lena
just have wicked dance
chemistry.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.987
But he's totally your
guy.

07:02.623 --> 07:06.492
Max and I talked. It's
all good. But why did you say
it in front of everybody?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.461
I'm sorry. That was
my bad.

07:08.494 --> 07:12.599
(Etienne) Lose the juice.
It's still against the rules,
even if it is Saturday.

07:14.134 --> 07:19.973
Jeeze. Yo, check this
out. How about some of this for
the assignment?

07:20.006 --> 07:26.246
No way. After that
humiliation, we have to
destroy everybody. Especially
Little Miss Perfect.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.982
(sarcastic) Ah. Glad
to see we're totally over
it.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.818
Come on. I've got
a reputation you almost
destroyed.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.688
Okay. I'm all
in...

07:40.160 --> 07:46.232
Awesome! Yeah!
Ah ah! Yes! And
pose!

07:48.134 --> 07:49.202
Phoo!

08:00.681 --> 08:04.585
Wow, that is quite the
letter delivery outfit you're
wearing.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.688
(giggles) Stop.

You've been following me
since we left school. What are
you doing?

08:56.937 --> 09:02.676
Well, we have an
assignment to rehearse for
so... I thought we could get
started.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.846
Oh! Why didn't you say
so?

09:06.913 --> 09:09.315

-Gracias, tia.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.770
You didn't tell me
you were bringing a
friend.

09:30.236 --> 09:34.741
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm unannounced and I
don't have an appropriate
gift.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.877
Are you two
rehearsing for a play or
something?

09:37.143 --> 09:39.345
No, she is very...
polite.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.183
I'll say. Everyone's
inside, come on!

09:50.090 --> 09:54.360
Not out! No ball. Oh, that's
an illegal delivery.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.796
Care for a round?

09:55.829 --> 09:59.332
Uh... no. I think I'd
rather watch paint dry. We
have to rehearse.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.268
I get it. You're not up for the
challenge.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.307
Yes, Mister Khan, whacking
it out of the park!

10:07.340 --> 10:08.875
Not bad.

10:08.909 --> 10:13.079
Well, I did rank fourth in the
UK junior league, so I may know
a thing or two.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.216
As if... Wait,
really?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.690
Any more
surprises?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.160
I'm a wicked tennis player, I
can count to a hundred in
Mandarin

10:27.193 --> 10:29.963
and I'm a
brilliant
Bollywood dancer.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.266
This, I have got to see!
-(chuckles) Follow me!

10:33.834 --> 10:35.769
(Ines chuckles)

10:36.302 --> 10:40.206
Pow, pow! Head,
head! Pow, pow!
Head, head!

10:40.240 --> 10:44.911
And you punch it out. Punch
it out, punch it out. Punch
it out, punch it out.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.713
Yeah, I'm good,
thanks.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.251

on!

10:54.354 --> 10:57.924
Right. Start with the
hands. Pow, pow!

10:57.958 --> 10:59.025
Pow,
pow!

10:59.059 --> 11:01.194
Head, head.
-Head, head.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.930
And you punch it out.
-Punch it out, punch it out.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.666
That's it, that's
good! You got it.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.233
Yeah, it's kind of
fun actually.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.203
My Grandma taught me
that. Check this out.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.105
Hm.
Wow!

11:12.138 --> 11:14.340
That was her
favourite. (Laughs)

11:14.374 --> 11:17.377
She taught a class
every Sunday morning and I
used to jump in.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.981
It was usually sunny,
but sometimes we even danced
in the rain. Do you like cats?

11:21.014 --> 11:24.851
Wow. That is a lot
of intel about your
family.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.420
And yeah, of course I
love cats. I'm not a monster.

11:27.453 --> 11:30.891
I talk too much when I get...
-Yeah, yeah... Can we just do
the dance?

11:30.924 --> 11:32.893
OK, yes.
Dance.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.396
Oh,
music!

11:36.429 --> 11:38.264
(Indian music
plays)

11:38.298 --> 11:43.103
Get in with the
head! Yeah! The hips.
That's it!

11:43.136 --> 11:45.038
Like
this?

11:45.071 --> 11:47.407
Feel it!
(Laughs)

11:48.108 --> 11:50.076
OK. Pow,
pow!

11:51.044 --> 11:53.313
Pow! Oh!
-Oh!

11:54.347 --> 11:56.149
Yeah! Punch
out!

11:56.182 --> 11:59.152
(Dash) Punching out.
And ahh!

12:03.423 --> 12:06.126
Tsh, tsh. Woooow!
-Pow, pow.

12:07.093 --> 12:09.963
Pow. (Chuckles) Right.
-Aaah!

12:10.797 --> 12:14.500
(Dash) Improvise. Improvise.
-(Ines clicking her tongue)

12:17.370 --> 12:18.772
(Ines) Good?
Boom.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.808
Oh, I like this.
(Laughs)

12:22.843 --> 12:25.078
You know this is
totally our assignment,
right?

12:26.012 --> 12:29.115
Totally!
-Oh, oh, oh!

12:29.149 --> 12:31.217
(both) Pow,
pow!

12:32.485 --> 12:34.354
Tada!
-(both laugh)

12:34.988 --> 12:36.222
Oh...

12:38.258 --> 12:40.994
Hm. I'm not
bored.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.764
(hesitantly)
Thanks.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.267
(both
chuckle)

12:50.036 --> 12:52.573
Oh... (giggles)
-Oh! I...

12:52.606 --> 12:55.041
I... Uh... I'm
go...

12:55.075 --> 12:56.843
Break time?
-Yeah, definitely!

13:01.414 --> 13:04.350
(Spanish music
plays)

13:04.384 --> 13:06.119
Olé!

13:15.596 --> 13:18.999
So, you must be
Thea, the girlfriend...

13:19.032 --> 13:22.068
I've been begging
Maxi to bring you to lunch.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.872
Didn't you win that
American dance competition?
Dance In, Dance Out?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.307
(both) Dance
Off.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.410
You're even prettier than
in your pictures, Thea.

13:30.443 --> 13:34.447
And look at your hair! Your
locks shine like diamonds!

13:34.480 --> 13:36.116
Please tell them I'm
not Thea.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.919
Guys, this isn't
Thea. This is Lena.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.956
We're doing an
assignment together, that's
all. She's not my girlfriend.

13:42.989 --> 13:47.093
(Isabella) Well that's not
very bright. Look at her.
She's beautiful.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.229
And I guess you're
very smart too.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.331
Tia,
please...

13:51.364 --> 13:56.236
That's a very fair question.
Why isn't she your
girlfriend?

13:56.269 --> 14:03.944
Because, Tia. Lena has a
boyfriend, right? Henri. And I
have a girlfriend.

14:06.580 --> 14:10.216
(dramatic
music)

14:10.584 --> 14:15.455
(horses neighing,
hooves
clattering)

14:18.024 --> 14:22.228
I know you're mad, but
you can't just get rid of me by
shipping me off to Uncle
Alain's farm.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.965
Not with Lena in
the future.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.401
I know that between
the two of us, we can work
this out.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.172
If we build this
portal, we can get to Lena.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.008
No.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.445
It's too dangerous.
There are things you don't
know about.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.381
Things that
you don't
understand.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.984
Then tell me.
Please!

14:45.351 --> 14:47.220
I'm sorry,
son.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.592
You leave me no
choice.

14:56.530 --> 14:59.032
One day I hope
you'll understand.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.672
(car horns
honking)

15:09.743 --> 15:12.613
How do you know
about Henri?

15:12.646 --> 15:14.948
Is that why
you've been acting so
weird?

15:14.981 --> 15:18.585
I've been acting weird?
Lena, you're the one who's been
acting weird.

15:18.619 --> 15:21.354
Or do you normally just
follow people around, hiding
in bushes

15:21.387 --> 15:25.325
hoping to be invited
in for lunch? Very funny.

15:25.358 --> 15:30.430
No. Just, when I called
your name you didn't hear me.
So when I caught up I just...

15:30.463 --> 15:33.099
Thought that you
would follow me instead?

15:34.167 --> 15:38.471
I just... I mean...
Uh... I thought that...

15:41.441 --> 15:46.980
Do you like hanging
around? Or... out? Do you
like to hang out?

15:47.581 --> 15:49.550
Yeah... Um... Yeah,
I guess.

15:52.385 --> 15:57.257
Have you recently
expressed a greater
interest in your
appearance?

15:59.359 --> 16:00.460
I'm sorry,
what?

16:01.562 --> 16:03.664
What about
movies? Do you like
movies?

16:10.103 --> 16:16.710
(laughs) "Has he
recently introduced you to
members of his family?"

16:17.644 --> 16:20.747
Well, I mean, to be
fair, you've kind of ambushed
them, so...

16:20.781 --> 16:23.750
OK, well... after
what Jeff said, I was
worried.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.555
You thought I'd fallen
for you?

16:33.059 --> 16:40.701
(laughs) Don't worry.
You're safe. We're just
friends.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.504
Yeah, that's
right.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.440
I mean, that is what you
wanted, right?

16:47.473 --> 16:50.744
Exactly. It's what I
was hoping for.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.349
Perfect. Come
on.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.284
Wait. Shouldn't we
rehearse for the
assignment?

16:58.619 --> 17:00.621
What do you
think it is we're
doing here?

17:10.797 --> 17:15.636
We are not gonna be
doing that Scottish Warrior
thing, I can tell you that for
free.

17:15.669 --> 17:20.106
(sighs) Well, what
have you got besides that
four-year-old Gaga-yoncé
rip-off

17:20.140 --> 17:24.678
that you just tried to
pass off about an hour ago as
your own? Yeah, girl. I saw
that.

17:25.646 --> 17:29.550
Well... We've got to
do something. Yeah, and it's
not that.

17:34.721 --> 17:38.391
So. You really did
rank fourth in cricket then.
You weren't kidding.

17:38.424 --> 17:41.562
(scoffs) It was
just junior league.

17:41.595 --> 17:43.196
"Just junior
league."

17:46.499 --> 17:50.671
What about you? Winner of
a hundred thousand science
awards.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.576
Oh! I wasn't being
weird. I just looked you up,
like once, ages ago.

17:56.142 --> 17:59.079
But, it was an accident...
-Stop talking. Are you hungry?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.181
Yeah?

18:14.260 --> 18:18.164
(rhythmic
clapping)

18:19.633 --> 18:22.569
(people
cheering)

18:33.413 --> 18:37.818
(Lena) Your aunt is
wonderful but I really
think we should get back
and rehearse.

18:37.851 --> 18:41.522
So. Let's rehearse, then.
-Uh... I don't think...

18:41.555 --> 18:46.259
Come on, follow me! I
don't know about you, but I'm
rehearsing.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.361
Are you in, or out?
-Um, I...

18:48.394 --> 18:52.599
Don't let him push
you around. You take
charge.

18:53.333 --> 18:58.772
Thank you, Tia.
That's it! You got
it.

18:59.673 --> 19:00.774
You
ready?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.409
Five, six, seven,
eight.

19:04.244 --> 19:08.248
That's it... Now
twirl. And again.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.652
Oh no, no, no, that's too far.
-OK, OK. Let's try again.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.659
Five, six, seven,
eight.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.861
There we
go.

Food is my life. Like,
if I wasn't a dancer, I'd want
to be a chef or something.

20:04.505 --> 20:07.273
You'd probably be
amazing at that too.
-(giggles)

20:07.307 --> 20:13.714
Let me ask you
something. You're good at
tennis. You're a cricket
superstar back home.

20:13.747 --> 20:19.920
You're almost as good
a dancer as me... And I said
almost. So, what is it you
can't do?

20:20.554 --> 20:23.323
Trigonometry. (Both
laugh)

20:24.424 --> 20:28.662
So, Mr Cricket man,
what do your parents think
about you being a ballet
dancer?

20:29.295 --> 20:33.033
Well... they had
other plans for me. Yeah?

20:33.066 --> 20:37.337
But my Grandma, she's
the one who took me to my
first ballet.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.340
She convinced my
parents to let me come here.

20:41.441 --> 20:45.912
What about you,
Science Girl? Shouldn't you
be at some genius school for
brainiacs?

20:45.946 --> 20:51.317
Well, I got into a few
and I went to one for two
years. But um...

20:51.351 --> 20:57.891
When my parents got
divorced, I decided I wanted
to dance. And this is where
I wanted to be.

20:59.359 --> 21:06.066
I think they felt bad
about everything that was
going on so they said yes.
And here I am.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.002
Well, lucky for
me, cause here I am,

21:09.035 --> 21:11.838
on a date with the
most beautiful girl in the
whole school.

21:12.906 --> 21:16.877
A date?! Why would
you think this was a date?

21:17.410 --> 21:21.548
Uh... Whoa... I'm
sorry, but... I just thought,
here we are, having dinner,

21:21.582 --> 21:24.350
getting to know each
other. It's kind of like...
a date.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.588
Dash. We're having
food after working on a
school project. That is all!

21:27.621 --> 21:30.423
We can call it something
else, if you want. Like
sitting at the same table.

21:30.456 --> 21:35.862
Or, or breathing air in
the same... vicinity. Ines?

21:39.866 --> 21:45.105
I'm so full. I ate so
much but it was so good. I
really love your family.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.406
Yeah... they're
pretty cool.

21:46.439 --> 21:49.342
Do you really have lunch
with them every Saturday, like
that?

21:49.375 --> 21:52.546
Oh, Tia Isabella
would kill me if I missed
it even once.

21:52.579 --> 21:57.618
(laughs) You're so
lucky. It made me realize how
much I miss my family.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.622
Tia Isabella reminds
me of my mum. A lot.

22:01.655 --> 22:04.525
Oh yeah? She's
loud and overbearing as
well?

22:04.558 --> 22:06.927
Yes. She really
is. But she's also...

looking for you today. Where
were you?

22:32.452 --> 22:35.522
Sorry. My fault. We
were rehearsing and I was
having trouble...

22:35.556 --> 22:38.124

-Oh, I...

No, let me go!

23:42.222 --> 23:44.224
But you need me?
-Exactly.

23:44.257 --> 23:48.862
Well, Frank does.
He's building something.
It's science, math, nah...

something? I mean... Oh,
you got me...

It wasn't a
date. It was a
rehearsal.

it's gonna be all weird.

24:19.860 --> 24:22.629

-What?

24:23.096 --> 24:25.966
I think you like him.
-No, I don't.

24:26.533 --> 24:30.170
Anyway, how was Max?
Did you give him the
letter?

24:30.203 --> 24:34.941
No. We had lunch at his
Auntie's and danced, and
everything was fine so...

24:34.975 --> 24:40.714
Wow. Met the
family. (Teasingly) I
think you like him.

24:40.747 --> 24:46.086
I don't! We're just
friends. At least that's
what he said, anyway.

24:48.021 --> 24:50.156
Is that a
hint of
disappointment?

24:50.857 --> 24:55.796
It absolutely is
not. Good night.
-Good night.
