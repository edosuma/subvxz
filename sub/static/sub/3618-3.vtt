WEBVTT

00:05.032 --> 00:06.816
It's okay, you're gonna be okay.

00:06.916 --> 00:10.524
Okay? That demon wiped out
that whole family of innocents.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.531
- How will I ever be okay?
- You learn.

00:13.851 --> 00:16.197
<i>If that demon</i>
<i>is anywhere in that Book,</i>

00:16.297 --> 00:19.063
I'm gonna nail his sorry ass.

00:20.626 --> 00:22.691
Those poor children.

00:22.791 --> 00:24.655
They were so scared.

00:24.755 --> 00:26.299
I could feel their pain.

00:26.399 --> 00:28.905
Okay, maybe you could
feel their pain a little less, Phoebe.

00:29.005 --> 00:31.470
Remember, she's an empath now.

00:31.570 --> 00:33.274
I know what her powers are.

00:33.374 --> 00:37.584
Okay, I think a little sister bonding
is in order for all of us here.

00:37.945 --> 00:39.247
- I'll get the tea.
- No.

00:39.348 --> 00:41.051
Did you see that demon?

00:41.152 --> 00:44.599
Did you see those teeth,
flying out like razor blades?

00:44.920 --> 00:46.624
We need to kill that demon.

00:46.724 --> 00:50.051
For the children.
All six of those children.

00:50.372 --> 00:52.416
<i>Fine, we'll hit the Book now, tea later.</i>

01:10.977 --> 01:13.563
- Told you it wouldn't work.
- Well, it's her fault.

01:13.663 --> 01:16.249
Who's ever heard of a demon
with razor flying teeth before?

01:16.349 --> 01:18.654
My fault? I'm not the one
who made the innocents

01:18.755 --> 01:21.200
- into the von Trapp family.
- Did not.

01:21.521 --> 01:24.888
- Did too.
- Knock it off.

01:26.131 --> 01:28.476
It's my fault for going along
with you two.

01:28.576 --> 01:31.623
We can look like the Charmed Ones,
but let's face it, our acting sucks.

01:32.465 --> 01:35.652
<i>If we want the Book of Shadows,</i>
<i>we need to become them.</i>

01:35.752 --> 01:37.756
It's time to try my identity-theft spell.

01:38.719 --> 01:42.086
No way! They'll come after us.
It's a suicide mission.

01:42.407 --> 01:44.511
And it's dangerous too.

01:44.612 --> 01:47.077
So what? You wanna be
chiselers your whole life?

01:47.177 --> 01:49.442
It's time to think big,
and thinking big means

01:49.542 --> 01:51.988
making the whole world
believe that we are them.

01:52.389 --> 01:55.516
I don't wanna be them.
I wanna be bad.

01:55.836 --> 01:58.723
- Me too. Bad's better.
- Then stick with me.

01:59.043 --> 02:01.990
<i>Because once we get the Book,</i>
<i>we'll steal their powers</i>

02:02.090 --> 02:04.836
and then form our own power of three.

02:04.936 --> 02:04.936
- And you know what that means.
- No.

02:05.017 --> 02:07.362
- And you know what that means.
- No.

02:07.462 --> 02:09.547
We'll be the untouchable sisters.

02:11.110 --> 02:12.613
Phoebe, Paige, are you up there?

02:12.713 --> 02:14.718
Perfume, girls.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.184
What time did he go to sleep?

03:48.284 --> 03:51.311
Okay, can you call me
as soon as he starts to stir?

03:51.411 --> 03:53.416
Okay, thanks.

03:54.298 --> 03:57.204
Jack, the band is coming in in an
hour to set up and do a sound check.

03:57.304 --> 04:00.070
Can you take care of them? I wanna
be home when my baby wakes up.

04:00.391 --> 04:03.117
- I'm on it.
- Hey. You ready for lunch?

04:03.438 --> 04:06.985
I was thinking I can make you
something fabulous at home instead.

04:07.086 --> 04:09.832
Piper, every new mommy
needs a little grown-up time.

04:09.932 --> 04:12.357
- That's why we got the nanny, right?
- Right.

04:12.458 --> 04:14.582
So let's go...

04:16.305 --> 04:18.310
Was that a moan?

04:20.475 --> 04:22.480
- Piper!
- What?

04:24.284 --> 04:27.050
That new bartender guy
is checking you out.

04:34.386 --> 04:37.252
Are you telling me that you're feeling
what he's feeling for me?

04:37.352 --> 04:42.123
Yes, I still can't control
my new power.

04:44.328 --> 04:47.535
All right, that's it.
Take your shoes for a walk, buddy.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.566
- That's creepy.
- I know, it's horrible.

04:52.666 --> 04:55.372
You should have seen it
the last time Jason was in town.

04:55.472 --> 04:57.417
I couldn't keep my hands off of him.

04:57.517 --> 04:59.702
I don't know
what I'm gonna do this weekend.

04:59.802 --> 05:02.748
Jason is flying in
from Hong Kong again?

05:02.849 --> 05:05.354
Wow, I'd say that guy
is falling for you.

05:05.454 --> 05:08.401
You think so? I think so. I hope so.

05:08.501 --> 05:11.568
But all I can feel
is this strong sexual desire for me.

05:11.668 --> 05:13.933
And that's a bad thing.

05:14.033 --> 05:16.258
Yeah, it's a bad thing
if that's all he's feeling.

05:16.358 --> 05:20.848
And if it is all he's feeling,
I want to know now so I don't get hurt.

05:21.209 --> 05:23.153
Well, why don't you
take him to a restaurant,

05:23.254 --> 05:27.102
where you can't get buck wild,
and ask Jason how he feels.

05:28.706 --> 05:31.933
The direct approach.
Very sneaky of you.

05:32.033 --> 05:35.841
And if that doesn't work, ask him
about the weather in Hong Kong.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.071
- No.
- No. We're not demon hunting.

05:40.171 --> 05:41.514
We're going to lunch.

05:41.614 --> 05:44.380
Hey, I am not unreasonable.
We can hunt demons after lunch.

05:45.743 --> 05:48.409
- By the way, anyone seen Leo?
- No, I have not.

05:48.509 --> 05:50.414
- I haven't either.
- If you do, let me know.

05:50.514 --> 05:53.260
There's a rumour that he has
a lead on who sent him to Valhalla.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.106
I'm sure that's very important stuff,
but I have another question.

05:56.206 --> 05:58.572
<i>Did either one of you leave</i>
<i>the Book on the floor last night?</i>

05:59.293 --> 06:01.298
- On the floor?
- No, I didn't.

06:02.781 --> 06:04.124
Chris?

06:04.224 --> 06:07.531
I vaguely remember a story
that started like that in the future.

06:07.632 --> 06:10.378
<i>- Someone was after the Book.</i>
<i>- Demons are always after the Book.</i>

06:10.478 --> 06:12.382
- What's new?
- I think this time they get it.

06:12.482 --> 06:15.148
You should take
this threat seriously. And tell Paige.

06:15.248 --> 06:17.513
- Where is Paige?
- She's at her new temp job.

06:17.614 --> 06:19.959
- She's still on that kick?
- It's not a kick, Chris.

06:20.059 --> 06:22.925
It's her quest for happiness
outside of magic.

06:23.025 --> 06:27.074
Yeah, but it's a temp job.
Who finds happiness on a temp job?

06:30.642 --> 06:33.709
Straighten your back. You wanna
get out of bed in the morning?

06:33.809 --> 06:35.673
Back straight. Check.

06:35.774 --> 06:39.141
<i>No, no, mira. Don't reach.</i>
<i>Let them come to you.</i>

06:39.863 --> 06:41.165
Okay.

06:41.266 --> 06:43.410
Forget it. Keep the line moving.

06:43.511 --> 06:46.377
Okay. How long have you been
working here, anyway?

06:46.477 --> 06:49.143
Eight years and two herniated discs.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.909
Didn't know what you were getting into
on this one, did you?

06:52.009 --> 06:54.816
No, I can't say as I did. But it's fun.

06:55.136 --> 06:57.922
You know, I get to work with my hands
and it's kind of like nature.

06:58.023 --> 07:00.027
And best of all, there's no magic.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.956
Markers, magic markers,
I'm crazy... Crazy allergic.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.624
Oh, no.

07:07.724 --> 07:09.728
Watch out!

07:14.780 --> 07:16.784
Everybody okay over here?

07:17.826 --> 07:19.891
She saved my life.

07:19.991 --> 07:21.815
- It was nothing.
- All right, everybody,

07:21.915 --> 07:23.980
take 20 till we can
perform a safety check here.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.566
That is the third accident this month.

07:27.608 --> 07:31.657
<i>I think this place is maldito. Cursed.</i>

07:31.978 --> 07:34.984
<i>I think I'm maldito.</i>

07:41.038 --> 07:42.781
I can't tell if anyone's home from here.

07:42.882 --> 07:44.144
If I get Piper's powers,

07:44.245 --> 07:46.870
first thing I'm gonna do
is freeze these unwanted facial lines.

07:46.971 --> 07:50.198
I'm the oldest, I get Piper's powers.
You'll get Paige's.

07:50.298 --> 07:53.906
Well, in that case,
maybe I'll orb away this blemish.

07:54.227 --> 07:56.832
Stakeout takeout, anyone?

07:57.313 --> 07:59.699
All I asked for was a scrying bulb.

07:59.799 --> 08:01.382
Just because
we killed the owners here

08:01.483 --> 08:04.128
doesn't mean we
should let their food go to waste.

08:05.251 --> 08:10.903
<i>Give me sight though the blackest bile</i>
<i>Show me the faces I revile</i>

08:14.592 --> 08:16.536
Piper's the only one home right now.

08:16.636 --> 08:19.623
We need all three sisters together
for my spell to work.

08:19.723 --> 08:23.451
She's with the baby. I can't wait
to orb that thing into a volcano.

08:23.772 --> 08:27.380
As the baby in the family,
I'm afraid I'll be doing the orbing.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.867
- We get our powers by sorority.
- That's "seniority," Margo.

08:31.188 --> 08:33.011
And that's not fair.
I wanted Paige's power.

08:33.111 --> 08:36.559
Don't talk to me about fair.
I always got less growing up.

08:36.881 --> 08:38.905
And usually two years out of style.

08:39.005 --> 08:41.671
There's nothing wrong
with Phoebe's powers, Mitzy.

08:41.770 --> 08:45.319
- You'll be able to levitate.
- Yeah, six feet in the air.

08:45.419 --> 08:47.484
Margo will be orbing
around the world.

08:47.584 --> 08:48.887
I'll send postcards.

08:48.987 --> 08:52.255
Don't forget, you'll also have the
power of premonition and empathy.

08:52.355 --> 08:55.401
Like I care what happens
to people or how they feel.

08:55.722 --> 08:59.050
Maybe you should care, instead of this
"me, me, me" attitude all the time.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.876
You're gonna get your teeth
knocked in if you don't back off!

09:01.976 --> 09:04.121
Enough!
What is wrong with you two?

09:04.221 --> 09:07.669
We have worked way too hard
to let it all fall apart now.

09:13.882 --> 09:16.027
Hello, are you the lady of the house?

09:16.127 --> 09:18.132
Go away.

09:18.853 --> 09:20.998
This is the biggest con of our lives.

09:21.098 --> 09:24.385
If we don't get this right, we're gonna
be two-bit magic hustlers forever.

09:24.706 --> 09:26.711
Is that what you want?

09:30.078 --> 09:32.583
But you haven't seen
the amazing new Kelby 3000.

09:32.684 --> 09:35.490
- Just get inside.
- Okay, okay.

09:38.176 --> 09:42.305
The secret of the Charmed Ones lies
in their sisterhood. The power of three.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.810
Well, guess what.
We got our own sisterhood.

09:44.911 --> 09:46.935
Our own power of three, right here.

09:47.035 --> 09:50.202
If we can just stick together,
we can have it all.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.510
You'll never have it all
until you own the Kelby 3000.

09:53.610 --> 09:57.298
I'm telling you,
this baby is gonna change your...

09:59.623 --> 10:01.808
So who's with me?

10:01.908 --> 10:03.211
I'm sorry, sweetie.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.017
Oh, me too.

10:06.117 --> 10:08.382
I'll orb you anywhere you wanna go.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.688
That's more like it.

10:11.008 --> 10:15.779
Now, let's sit back,
relax until the other two get home.

10:19.266 --> 10:21.511
All right, look, Mommy'll try it.

10:22.874 --> 10:26.282
That's so horrible!
Wow, is that horrible.

10:28.567 --> 10:30.932
Leo, what are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

10:32.095 --> 10:35.101
I was looking for Chris.
I heard he was asking about me.

10:35.462 --> 10:39.671
He was. He thinks you found
the person that sent you to Valhalla.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.139
He does?

10:43.239 --> 10:45.144
But he's not here.

10:45.244 --> 10:49.734
But even if he was, I mean, why can't
you use your Elder powers to sense,

10:50.135 --> 10:52.580
like you sensed me here with?

10:57.471 --> 10:59.094
Sorry.

10:59.194 --> 11:01.620
For missing your son? That's okay.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.065
As an Elder,
I watch over him every minute,

11:04.165 --> 11:05.989
but it's not the same, you know.

11:06.090 --> 11:09.978
When he's sleeping, sometimes I orb
into the nursery just to hold him.

11:11.983 --> 11:14.849
Yeah. Yeah.

11:14.949 --> 11:17.355
- Piper, you home?
- I shouldn't have come.

11:22.486 --> 11:24.310
- Sweetie.
- Dude, there are gremlins

11:24.410 --> 11:25.633
at the fruit-packing plant.

11:25.733 --> 11:28.720
And I am the only one who can
prevent serious workplace injury.

11:28.820 --> 11:30.764
This is not what I planned.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.889
You lost me at "fruit-packing plant."

11:32.989 --> 11:34.813
It's my new temp job.

11:34.913 --> 11:36.938
I keep trying to find
a life away from magic,

11:37.038 --> 11:39.403
and all I get is magic,
magic, magic, everywhere.

11:40.766 --> 11:44.174
Oh, don't worry, little dude,
I'm not gonna let the gremlins get you.

11:44.494 --> 11:47.301
It's okay,
I think he just misses his dad.

11:48.744 --> 11:51.009
<i>I'm gonna go upstairs</i>
<i>and check in the Book of Shadows</i>

11:51.109 --> 11:53.835
and see what it says about
the capture and control of gremlins.

11:54.516 --> 11:57.082
<i>Did you leave the Book</i>
<i>on the floor last night?</i>

11:57.403 --> 11:58.505
No, why?

11:58.606 --> 12:00.710
I don't know, it's probably nothing.

12:00.810 --> 12:03.617
Just be on the lookout.
Chris said somebody may be after it.

12:03.937 --> 12:05.942
People are after it every week.

12:06.343 --> 12:08.347
You're okay, you're okay.

12:08.868 --> 12:11.053
Fussy babies need fresh air.

12:11.153 --> 12:13.579
Oh, that's a good idea.
I'll go get my sweater.

12:13.679 --> 12:16.826
Nonsense. Let me take
the boy for a walk.

12:16.926 --> 12:18.790
All right.

12:18.890 --> 12:21.757
Just don't forget
a hat for those ears.

12:21.857 --> 12:23.480
I always keep the baby warm.

12:23.581 --> 12:25.585
I meant yours.

12:29.674 --> 12:32.380
You are on a real hot streak, kiddo.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.168
Your advice column has never been
more revealing.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.554
Yeah, well, I just think
that I'm really in touch

12:38.654 --> 12:40.718
with what other people
are feeling right now.

12:40.819 --> 12:43.184
Whatever it is, keep it up.

12:49.999 --> 12:52.003
Honey!

12:53.206 --> 12:56.774
- You're back!
- God, I missed you, Phoebe.

13:00.783 --> 13:03.408
Oh, no. No, no, not again.

13:03.509 --> 13:06.094
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

13:06.195 --> 13:08.199
How was the weather in Hong Kong?

13:08.800 --> 13:11.827
- Weather?
- Yeah, I hear it gets very balmy there.

13:11.927 --> 13:14.613
- Balmy.
- I suppose.

13:15.415 --> 13:17.439
You really wanna
talk about the weather?

13:17.540 --> 13:19.544
No, I just don't wanna
be alone with you.

13:20.185 --> 13:24.715
I mean, I do wanna be alone with you,
just not alone with you here, you know?

13:25.076 --> 13:28.604
I just... I wanna be alone
with you in a public area.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.196
You're still a little shaken up
over my last visit.

13:34.297 --> 13:36.040
You know,
your behaviour wasn't all that...

13:36.141 --> 13:38.827
Humiliating and embarrassing.
It was.

13:39.588 --> 13:44.279
Yeah. I just would appreciate
if we could take things...

13:44.679 --> 13:49.690
...slower, you know?
Maybe go out for dinner and talk.

13:50.492 --> 13:52.677
I'll pick you up at 7.

13:52.777 --> 13:54.782
Okay.

13:57.588 --> 14:00.795
Can't wait to talk. Talk.

14:09.173 --> 14:10.877
You know what this means.

14:10.977 --> 14:13.503
It's spell time.

14:15.066 --> 14:16.730
We got one shot, so pay attention.

14:16.830 --> 14:21.040
After we read this spell, the world
will see us as the Halliwell sisters.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.663
You mean I'm going brunette?

14:22.763 --> 14:25.529
No, you'll look like you do now,
but the world will know you as Phoebe.

14:25.850 --> 14:27.674
Let's go, let's go!

14:27.774 --> 14:32.104
I'm dying to orb someplace far away
and exotic, like Fort Lauderdale.

14:32.465 --> 14:35.592
Not so fast.
The spell only gives us their identities.

14:35.912 --> 14:38.899
<i>They keep their powers until</i>
<i>we can get to the Book of Shadows.</i>

14:38.999 --> 14:41.986
Which we should be able to do
once we lure them out of the house.

14:42.086 --> 14:45.012
Okay, everyone ready?

14:46.736 --> 14:53.150
<i>"Blinking faces blank and ho-hum</i>
<i>We are they and they are no one</i>

14:53.591 --> 14:59.645
<i>Grant to us the power of three</i>
<i>and turn them into nobody"</i>

15:02.210 --> 15:04.034
Did it work?

15:04.135 --> 15:08.344
One way to find out.
Let's call our whitelighter.

15:09.186 --> 15:11.190
Chris.

15:17.203 --> 15:21.373
Why did you change clothes, Piper?
You can't hunt demons in heels.

15:21.733 --> 15:23.638
Go switch your shoes
and we'll get started.

15:23.738 --> 15:26.704
Hey, slow down there, angel.

15:27.025 --> 15:30.052
It's all good in the charmed universe.
What's your hurry?

15:30.152 --> 15:32.156
Paige, did you just call me "angel"?

15:32.718 --> 15:37.528
She did. And I can clearly see why.

15:38.009 --> 15:41.457
Okay. What are you doing
over here?

15:41.778 --> 15:44.383
Oh, well, we were just...

15:47.270 --> 15:52.120
Solving a murder. Evil has been here,
probably spying on us.

15:58.013 --> 16:00.639
<i>This could be connected to whoever</i>
<i>is after the Book of Shadows.</i>

16:00.739 --> 16:03.746
Could be. See that symbol
carved into the handle?

16:04.067 --> 16:06.292
We think that
that represents the astral plane.

16:06.392 --> 16:09.018
I don't know. The astral planes
are run with spirit and energy.

16:09.118 --> 16:11.142
It's not like they manufacture
athames there.

16:11.243 --> 16:13.868
All the more reason
you should orb over and investigate.

16:13.969 --> 16:15.592
You want me to orb
to the astral plane?

16:15.692 --> 16:18.899
Immediately. And don't come back till
you find out where that knife is from.

16:19.701 --> 16:21.726
Can I have a kiss goodbye?

16:21.826 --> 16:23.830
No.

16:25.113 --> 16:27.619
Oh, well, girl's gotta try.

16:27.719 --> 16:29.864
You know what this means.

16:29.964 --> 16:34.093
We are charmed and dangerous.
Oh, yeah.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.999
- Excuse me. Elise?
- Phoebe. I thought you left.

16:46.099 --> 16:48.204
I did. Now I'm back.

16:48.304 --> 16:50.890
That's not against the rules, is it?

16:50.990 --> 16:52.253
What you got there?

16:52.353 --> 16:55.641
It's a new article for tomorrow's paper.
I didn't like what I wrote before.

16:56.603 --> 16:57.705
Is this crayon?

16:57.805 --> 16:59.810
Eyeliner, actually. I didn't have a pen.

17:01.213 --> 17:03.959
Well, it's a little late for new copy,
but I'll see what I can do.

17:04.059 --> 17:05.923
Awesome.

17:06.022 --> 17:08.669
I mean, thank you.

17:09.431 --> 17:12.838
Phoebe. Thought you were
getting ready for dinner.

17:14.482 --> 17:16.948
You are hot.

17:17.048 --> 17:18.230
Are you okay?

17:18.330 --> 17:21.176
Never better. Did you say
we were hooking up tonight?

17:21.738 --> 17:23.040
I'll swing by at 7.

17:23.141 --> 17:25.506
Great. I'll be ready for you, sugar.

17:43.867 --> 17:47.715
I did not fire your band.
I need them to play tonight.

17:48.116 --> 17:50.461
Today at rehearsal?
No, that's impossible.

17:50.562 --> 17:52.666
I have been home all afternoon.

17:52.766 --> 17:55.412
Okay, listen. I'll be right there.

17:56.134 --> 17:57.276
I gotta go to P3,

17:57.377 --> 18:00.123
so tell the nanny to give
Wyatt dinner if I'm not back in time.

18:00.223 --> 18:02.227
Okay. Bye.

18:04.873 --> 18:08.321
Okay, this vanquishing potion
is more like vanquishing goo.

18:08.642 --> 18:10.626
Can you check
the last ingredient for me?

18:10.726 --> 18:12.731
Sure.

18:14.254 --> 18:16.940
- That was different.
- Try it again.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.891
It's like it's not recognizing us.

18:21.991 --> 18:25.799
Okay, that's weird, I was just holding
it in my hands ten minutes ago.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.305
<i>Wait, Chris said something</i>
<i>might happen to the Book,</i>

18:28.405 --> 18:30.349
remember, and we just
kind of blew him off?

18:30.450 --> 18:32.735
Chris! Hello, are you there?

18:35.942 --> 18:37.325
Is that you? Who is that?

18:37.425 --> 18:39.289
Both of us.

18:39.389 --> 18:41.253
- Hello?
- Hey, Elise.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.418
There's a union rally
at the fruit-packing plant?

18:43.518 --> 18:46.345
No, I did not advocate
multiple sex partners.

18:46.445 --> 18:49.812
- I'm not leading the rally, I'm at home.
- I didn't say alcohol cures depression.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.198
Of course I believe
in equal pay for workers.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.302
- This is Phoebe. Hello?
- Hello?

18:56.347 --> 18:57.890
- Emergency at work?
- Yeah.

18:57.990 --> 19:00.175
- Unfortunate coincidence?
- Not likely.

19:00.275 --> 19:02.340
I don't know about you,
but I wanna keep my job.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.387
Yeah, me too. I'll leave a note
for the nanny, she's out walking Wyatt.

19:05.487 --> 19:06.990
<i>And I'll try to put the Book away.</i>

19:07.090 --> 19:10.899
I'm gonna change in case I don't make
it back in time for my date with Jason.

19:11.219 --> 19:14.026
All right, meet back here
as soon as possible.

19:24.649 --> 19:26.794
Hey, Ray, did the band leave yet?

19:26.894 --> 19:28.898
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're not open yet.

19:29.339 --> 19:31.604
- Very funny.
- You'll have to come back tonight.

19:31.705 --> 19:35.112
Ray, I'm missing dinnertime with my
kid because the band cancelled, okay?

19:35.433 --> 19:36.856
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

19:36.956 --> 19:39.502
They didn't cancel,
the owner fired them.

19:39.602 --> 19:41.947
Too bad, too, they were good.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.511
You one of their groupies?

19:43.611 --> 19:48.101
No, I'm your boss and
I'm gonna fire you if you don't move it.

19:48.462 --> 19:52.110
Look, lady, there's a bar open up the
road if you really need another drink.

19:55.116 --> 19:58.965
I have to admit, Piper, when you
said that there'd be fringe benefits,

19:59.285 --> 20:02.813
- you weren't kidding.
- Oh, I'm all about job satisfaction.

20:03.134 --> 20:06.221
- Yeah? What about after-hours?
- Yeah, so do I.

20:06.541 --> 20:09.428
And you're gonna be
one sorry dude if you don't move!

20:12.394 --> 20:15.221
You know what?
There's some work I have to deal with,

20:15.321 --> 20:17.746
but I'll try to wrap it up early.

20:17.846 --> 20:20.071
Why don't you come by the house
after your shift.

20:20.172 --> 20:22.497
Like you could.

20:26.706 --> 20:29.171
Why is Ray acting
like he doesn't know me?

20:29.272 --> 20:31.376
Would you please tell him who I am?

20:31.476 --> 20:34.042
Sure. Who are you?

20:34.603 --> 20:40.937
<i>Equal pay, shorter days.</i>
<i>Equal pay, shorter days.</i>

20:49.115 --> 20:51.020
What a circus.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.906
Okay, get down! Quiet down!
Everybody quiet down!

20:54.006 --> 20:57.033
I talked to my supervisor,
and he's replacing all of you

20:57.133 --> 21:00.080
if you don't get your asses
back on that line!

21:00.180 --> 21:02.365
You mean the line with
unsafe working conditions?

21:02.465 --> 21:04.690
- Yeah!
- No medical benefits?

21:04.790 --> 21:06.794
- Yeah!
- And third-world wages?

21:07.636 --> 21:09.260
I don't think so.

21:09.360 --> 21:14.131
<i>Equal pay, shorter days.</i>
<i>Equal pay, shorter days.</i>

21:14.491 --> 21:15.754
May I help you, miss?

21:15.854 --> 21:18.941
Oh, it's okay, I work here.
Who's that girl on the conveyor belt?

21:19.663 --> 21:21.667
I'd like to see some ID, please.

21:24.754 --> 21:27.500
- Who you steal this from?
- What are you talking about?

21:27.600 --> 21:30.206
Come on, let's go.

21:35.658 --> 21:39.146
<i>Split up, fan out. Find the Book.</i>
<i>We don't have much...</i>

21:39.466 --> 21:41.471
I'm on to you three.

21:42.192 --> 21:44.257
What do we do?

21:44.357 --> 21:46.983
You thought you could fool me,
but you can't.

21:47.083 --> 21:50.030
This athame
isn't from the astral plane.

21:50.130 --> 21:51.673
You sent me on a wild-goose chase

21:51.774 --> 21:54.760
so you wouldn't have
to hunt demons, didn't you, Piper?

21:54.860 --> 21:57.566
- Busted.
- Guilty.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.671
You figured us out, Chris.

22:00.312 --> 22:03.680
We are so sorry.

22:04.361 --> 22:06.787
Yeah, you should be.

22:06.887 --> 22:08.911
Look, there's an evil
out there after Wyatt,

22:09.012 --> 22:13.060
and we need to find him before he...
Phoebe, what are you doing?

22:13.381 --> 22:15.366
Finding comfort in my whitelighter.

22:15.466 --> 22:17.570
You're all over him.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.296
You're just jealous
because I got to him first.

22:20.397 --> 22:24.165
Look, Phoebe, I know Piper
hooked up with her last whitelighter,

22:24.486 --> 22:28.775
but I'm really,
really not interested, okay?

22:29.136 --> 22:30.920
Can we get back
to hunting demons, please?

22:31.020 --> 22:33.385
Actually, Chris, we can't.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.811
We didn't ditch you to play hooky.

22:35.911 --> 22:39.038
We needed time to investigate
the death across the street.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.343
Well, why didn't you
say so in the first place?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.989
I would have given you time off
for legitimate charmed duties.

22:44.089 --> 22:47.216
Well, we're asking now. We believe
that athame belongs to witches.

22:47.537 --> 22:50.443
Really smart, pretty witches.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.287
We just don't know who they are.

22:52.387 --> 22:54.532
So why don't I check around
this realm for you.

22:54.632 --> 22:56.617
It's like you read my mind.

22:56.717 --> 23:00.485
See? I can be reasonable and helpful.
All you gotta do is be honest with me.

23:04.454 --> 23:08.022
<i>Okay, now we really are running</i>
<i>out of time. We need that Book.</i>

23:08.342 --> 23:10.848
You two search down here,
I'm gonna take upstairs.

23:10.948 --> 23:15.398
And from now on,
keep your hands off the whitelighter.

23:15.839 --> 23:17.843
That's an order.

23:39.491 --> 23:42.017
Hurry. Hurry, before they get home!

23:44.462 --> 23:46.747
This is it, this is what we want.

23:48.270 --> 23:50.916
All right, who do you think you are?

23:51.237 --> 23:54.163
Oh, you haven't heard?
We're the Charmed Ones.

23:55.286 --> 23:56.549
Nice dress.

23:56.649 --> 23:58.072
Thanks.

23:58.172 --> 24:00.177
<i>Nice Book.</i>

24:01.099 --> 24:04.867
<i>- "Powers of the witches, rise"</i>
<i>- Hey, hey. I can't freeze them.</i>

24:05.188 --> 24:09.597
<i>"Come to us, who call you near</i>
<i>Come to us and settle here"</i>

24:11.842 --> 24:15.651
Let's see, what was that
freaky little hand thing you did?

24:15.972 --> 24:17.976
Like this?

24:19.579 --> 24:21.584
Oh, I'm down!

24:30.243 --> 24:32.247
Paige.

24:35.374 --> 24:38.020
- I can still orb.
- That was supposed to be my power.

24:38.982 --> 24:41.829
- Freeze them!
- I don't know how!

24:48.844 --> 24:53.133
You guys gotta see this. There's spells,
potions, charms for everything.

24:53.454 --> 24:56.862
<i>Once we get rid of the Halliwells,</i>
<i>this Book is gonna change our lives.</i>

24:57.182 --> 25:00.630
You guys, my arm's getting sore here.
How about a little relief?

25:01.672 --> 25:04.138
Never takes this long
to scry for a witch.

25:04.238 --> 25:06.222
That's because
they're not witches anymore.

25:06.323 --> 25:07.786
We got their powers.

25:07.886 --> 25:13.458
Excuse me. You got their powers.
I got a big, fat nothing. As usual.

25:13.859 --> 25:17.307
Margo, please.
Ease off the resentment pedal there.

25:17.627 --> 25:18.930
You're dragging me down.

25:19.031 --> 25:21.917
Oh, this is great: vanquishing tips
on all of our competition.

25:22.238 --> 25:25.064
Paige orbed.
How could she still do that?

25:25.164 --> 25:26.908
We cast a spell
to call the witches' power.

25:27.008 --> 25:29.153
Paige's orbing must come
from her whitelighter side.

25:29.253 --> 25:30.596
Well, then, let's call for her
whitelighter's power.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.200
Well, then, let's call for her
whitelighter's power.

25:32.300 --> 25:37.030
- Because I wanna orb!
- Yo, Margo. Get over it already.

25:37.391 --> 25:40.137
Your negativity
is giving me a migraine.

25:40.237 --> 25:43.966
You think it's bad now? Just keep
flaunting that empath power at me.

25:44.286 --> 25:46.291
I'll start hating on you for real.

25:46.932 --> 25:49.979
<i>- Hey, we're in here!</i>
<i>- We made the Book of Shadows?</i>

25:52.665 --> 25:54.048
What, no picture?

25:54.148 --> 25:56.052
Just a paragraph.

25:56.152 --> 25:59.600
A really, really tiny paragraph.

25:59.921 --> 26:03.849
"The Stillman sisters:
Mabel, Mitzy, Margo.

26:04.170 --> 26:07.337
Common witches known
for their small-time hustles and cons.

26:07.658 --> 26:09.482
Not worth vanquishing.

26:09.582 --> 26:13.591
If they become a nuisance,
try a simple spell to bind their magic."

26:16.076 --> 26:17.540
Well, at least we got an entry.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.704
Yeah, but look
at what they think of us.

26:19.805 --> 26:21.989
Common witches,
not worth vanquishing?

26:22.090 --> 26:25.617
Is that right? Well, check what
these common witches just did.

26:25.938 --> 26:29.466
We're standing in the home of the
Charmed Ones. We got their powers.

26:29.827 --> 26:32.633
<i>We got their Book, and we got...</i>

26:32.954 --> 26:36.361
...blond, multi-tonal hair.
Who's the nuisance now?

26:36.682 --> 26:39.227
- We are.
- Oh, yeah.

26:39.328 --> 26:41.833
So let's use all these powers
and find the Halliwells.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.780
We cannot rest until they're dead.

26:45.581 --> 26:48.949
Phoebe's boyfriend.
She had dinner plans with him tonight.

26:50.031 --> 26:51.815
Go. Margo and I will work on spells.

26:51.915 --> 26:54.461
Wait, what?
Why does she get to go on a date?

26:54.561 --> 26:56.506
We have to keep up pretences.

26:56.606 --> 26:58.590
If Leo or Chris
find that we're impostors,

26:58.690 --> 27:01.436
they're gonna send the entire
magical community after those girls.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.503
And then we'll never find them. Go.

27:05.746 --> 27:08.552
I felt that, Miss Blackheart.

27:11.078 --> 27:13.122
Let's get to work.

27:20.458 --> 27:21.801
Okay.

27:21.902 --> 27:23.906
Okay.

27:26.873 --> 27:28.656
Let's see what we got here.

27:28.757 --> 27:30.861
This... You all right?

27:30.962 --> 27:32.826
- Yeah.
- You sure?

27:32.926 --> 27:35.552
Oh, it's really bad.
It's really, really bad.

27:35.652 --> 27:36.794
Okay, just do what you can.

27:36.895 --> 27:39.921
We have to get back
to the manor fast, for Wyatt.

27:40.022 --> 27:43.008
They're not gonna hurt Wyatt.
They won't risk exposure.

27:43.108 --> 27:44.371
Not while we're still alive.

27:44.471 --> 27:45.935
How are we gonna stay alive?

27:46.035 --> 27:47.779
How are we gonna fight
without our powers?

27:47.879 --> 27:50.465
- At least you could still orb.
- I wish you could orb to Leo.

27:50.565 --> 27:53.411
I'd give anything for one
of his unwanted visits right...

27:54.413 --> 27:56.277
Piper, we should
get you to the doctor.

27:56.378 --> 27:57.600
- No.
- Why?

27:57.700 --> 28:01.188
The same reason we paid cash for this
room: because without picture IDs,

28:01.509 --> 28:04.576
we got no credit cards, we got
nothing. It's like we don't exist.

28:04.676 --> 28:06.500
Everyone thinks we're
these trashy blonds.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.184
I do have to hand it to them, though.

28:08.284 --> 28:10.409
They've taken identity theft
to a whole new level.

28:10.729 --> 28:12.072
What about Chris?

28:12.172 --> 28:15.620
What if we get him in the same room
with the blond ones?

28:15.941 --> 28:17.564
Then we can prove to him
they're fakes.

28:17.665 --> 28:21.032
How? He can't hear our call. Going in
the manor right now would be suicide.

28:21.353 --> 28:24.840
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

28:25.161 --> 28:27.747
Maybe we can find some
magical creatures to help us,

28:27.847 --> 28:30.032
like fairies or muses.
What do you think?

28:30.132 --> 28:33.740
We won't be able to see them.
We're not witches anymore.

28:35.624 --> 28:38.891
You're not, you can't see them,
but I'm still half whitelighter.

28:38.992 --> 28:40.495
And I actually happen to know

28:40.595 --> 28:43.461
where a couple of handy-dandy
gremlins like to hang out.

28:43.562 --> 28:45.987
You mean
the fruit-packer-killing variety?

28:46.087 --> 28:48.152
No, no, no.
This could actually work.

28:48.252 --> 28:50.958
Gremlins are fast, right?
They can move between realms.

28:51.058 --> 28:52.642
They could actually
help us find Chris.

28:52.742 --> 28:54.686
- What if they say no?
- Well, if they say no,

28:54.786 --> 28:57.873
then I'll just have to threaten their
little butts with my vanquishing gel.

28:58.194 --> 29:01.301
Okay, Paige, you orb to
the plant and find those gremlins.

29:01.401 --> 29:03.466
Chris has gotta be back
at the manor by midnight.

29:03.566 --> 29:06.071
- Piper, stay here where you're safe.
- Where are you going?

29:06.171 --> 29:09.860
I'm going to hand out
a personal invitation.

29:20.643 --> 29:23.931
Hey, now!
Who did you knock off for this?

29:24.251 --> 29:29.383
Oh, it's nothing. There's so much
that I want for us, Phoebe...

29:29.784 --> 29:31.207
How many carats are these?

29:31.307 --> 29:34.835
Miss, could we have
a wine menu here, please?

29:35.677 --> 29:37.681
Sure.

29:39.004 --> 29:40.948
Hey.

29:41.048 --> 29:44.496
You just earned yourself
a big, fat thank-you.

29:45.899 --> 29:48.024
Better get that.

29:49.106 --> 29:51.391
Phoebe, what are you
doing under the...?

29:52.474 --> 29:55.300
My wife was wondering
if you have any champagne.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.783
How dare she.

29:56.883 --> 30:02.496
I only drink it on special occasions.
This is our 42nd wedding anniversary.

30:02.897 --> 30:05.041
You slut!

30:05.142 --> 30:09.992
Can l...? Can I talk to you, Phoebe?
Up here, where I can see your face?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.705
Today you said you wanted to talk.

30:15.805 --> 30:18.270
And now you're groping me
under the table. What's going on?

30:18.371 --> 30:22.580
Well, if you didn't interrupt me,
you would have figured it out.

30:22.901 --> 30:26.428
Look, Phoebe, maybe
you got the wrong guy here.

30:27.671 --> 30:30.036
Because this isn't what I'm about.

30:31.239 --> 30:33.304
Really?

30:33.404 --> 30:34.667
Do you really mean that?

30:34.767 --> 30:36.110
Who are you?

30:36.210 --> 30:38.515
She's nobody, baby.
Let me take care of this.

30:38.615 --> 30:40.620
Listen, sweetie, l...

30:44.388 --> 30:46.012
Lady, what the hell's going on here?

30:46.112 --> 30:50.963
I'm so sorry, I thought she was
someone else. I'm sorry. Sorry.

30:51.363 --> 30:57.256
Hey, little blue fellas!
Come on out, I won't hurt you.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.455
Hey, will you slow down for a second?

31:05.555 --> 31:08.481
I have an offer
I'd like to discuss with you.

31:14.855 --> 31:16.860
What's it gonna be?

31:31.853 --> 31:33.857
Piper?

31:36.744 --> 31:38.247
What are you doing?

31:38.347 --> 31:40.351
Isn't it obvious?

31:40.672 --> 31:42.216
Yeah.

31:42.316 --> 31:44.320
But in front of our son?

31:45.082 --> 31:46.425
The lights are off.

31:46.525 --> 31:50.975
I think I'd better go, Piper.
I'll see you tomorrow at work.

31:51.376 --> 31:53.961
No. Wait.

31:54.062 --> 31:56.066
Oh, man.

31:56.387 --> 31:58.932
Look what you did. Aren't we,
like, divorced or something?

31:59.033 --> 32:00.536
What are you doing here?

32:00.636 --> 32:04.084
I told you, sometimes I visit Wyatt
in the nursery to hold him.

32:04.405 --> 32:06.750
It's the only chance
I get to spend any time with him.

32:06.850 --> 32:09.937
You know what? You're right.
I'm a terrible mother.

32:10.257 --> 32:12.262
I don't deserve our son,
you should take him.

32:12.703 --> 32:14.848
Careful, I just might.

32:14.948 --> 32:16.692
Great, it's settled. He's yours.

32:16.792 --> 32:20.119
Piper, what's the matter with you?
You're not acting like yourself.

32:22.124 --> 32:24.549
I'm sorry, Leo.

32:24.649 --> 32:28.017
I just think I'm just postpartum.

32:28.377 --> 32:30.582
I've just been
so tired and overworked.

32:30.903 --> 32:35.433
It would really help out if you could
take Wyatt off my hands for a while.

32:35.794 --> 32:37.798
Please?

32:44.132 --> 32:48.021
Don't worry about the bartender.
We've got bigger fish to fry.

32:56.560 --> 32:59.065
Okay, if the gremlins found Chris,
he should be here by now.

32:59.165 --> 33:01.370
Well, he'd better hurry.

33:01.731 --> 33:04.236
Okay, this is not good.

33:04.337 --> 33:06.341
Okay.

33:09.869 --> 33:12.775
You Charmed Ones
think you're so clever.

33:12.876 --> 33:16.323
Surprised to see us?
I got my first premonition tonight.

33:16.684 --> 33:20.132
I know you did, you genius.
I planted it to lead you here.

33:21.895 --> 33:25.744
Well, from where I'm standing,
that seems like a stupid thing to do.

33:26.065 --> 33:28.690
And I know a lot about stupid things.

33:28.791 --> 33:30.695
Yeah, see, she's got us there.

33:30.795 --> 33:33.180
You wouldn't happen to know
any gremlins, would you?

33:33.281 --> 33:35.465
- It's about time.
- Chris, thank God. Look at them.

33:35.566 --> 33:37.550
Look at them, they're impostors.
They stole...

33:37.650 --> 33:40.096
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Who are you?

33:40.416 --> 33:44.305
They're witches. They're the ones
that killed that guy across the street.

33:44.626 --> 33:46.450
No, Chris, she's lying.
Remember this morning,

33:46.550 --> 33:48.534
<i>you said something</i>
<i>was gonna happen to the Book?</i>

33:48.634 --> 33:50.098
This is it, it's happening now.

33:50.198 --> 33:52.323
Enough of this. Piper, blast them!

33:53.004 --> 33:54.547
How do you know what I said to Piper?

33:54.648 --> 33:57.494
Because she is Piper.
And I'm Paige, and this is Phoebe,

33:57.815 --> 34:00.982
and they cast an identity spell to make
the entire world think they're us.

34:01.302 --> 34:05.912
That's ridiculous. Everyone knows
the Charmed Ones are blond.

34:07.676 --> 34:10.803
If you're Piper, then show
me your powers. Blast me.

34:12.487 --> 34:14.491
I can't. You stole them.

34:15.694 --> 34:18.681
Okay, so we stole
your identities and your powers.

34:18.781 --> 34:20.885
Wow, we must be good.

34:20.985 --> 34:24.313
- Worth more than a paragraph.
- Oh, yeah.

34:24.634 --> 34:28.121
It's time to take care of
you witches and your delusions.

34:28.442 --> 34:31.108
Wait! Wait.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.634
I can prove that we're telling the truth.

34:33.734 --> 34:35.478
I can still orb, I'm half whitelighter.

34:35.578 --> 34:37.902
Okay. Go for it.

34:42.473 --> 34:44.478
Okay.

34:47.163 --> 34:49.829
What do you think
of my anti-orb spell?

34:49.929 --> 34:51.934
Oh, you...!

34:52.295 --> 34:54.299
Go ahead, Piper, blast away.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.729
She missed, Chris. When have
you ever known Piper to miss?

34:58.829 --> 35:00.733
Even I'm entitled to a bad day.

35:00.834 --> 35:02.838
Come on, try again.

35:04.321 --> 35:05.744
Chris, a little help here?

35:05.845 --> 35:07.749
Oh, you know what,
she's getting angry.

35:07.849 --> 35:09.954
And our powers don't work so good
when we're angry.

35:10.054 --> 35:12.199
- We got them now.
- Yeah, you got us now,

35:12.299 --> 35:13.802
so why don't you blow us up.

35:13.902 --> 35:15.406
Piper, death bad, life good.

35:15.506 --> 35:18.653
Don't worry, this bimbo couldn't hit
the broad side of a beauty parlour.

35:18.753 --> 35:21.098
Check out that dye job.

35:21.198 --> 35:23.203
How dare you!

35:26.450 --> 35:28.454
Run.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.523
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
we need weapons.

35:32.624 --> 35:34.628
- Demon leftovers!
- Okay.

35:35.149 --> 35:37.935
- Oh, Piper, Piper, for you.
- I got it.

35:38.036 --> 35:40.060
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.165
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.

35:45.733 --> 35:47.737
Now!

35:51.024 --> 35:53.470
So that's how it works.

35:54.071 --> 35:57.278
Could we, like,
not stand here right now?

35:59.844 --> 36:00.986
Now what?

36:01.086 --> 36:03.091
Now we kill them.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.302
You did it. Nice work, babe.

36:10.748 --> 36:13.774
This is not fair!

36:13.875 --> 36:16.140
First I get ripped off
in the power department.

36:16.240 --> 36:21.050
Then you bag the bartender and the
boyfriend lays diamonds on you.

36:21.411 --> 36:24.338
- That whitelighter belongs to me.
- Oh, my head!

36:24.658 --> 36:27.425
You know, you really need
to learn how to control your emotions.

36:27.745 --> 36:29.489
I can't help it that Chris chose me.

36:29.589 --> 36:30.852
Did you sleep with him?

36:30.952 --> 36:32.055
- No.
- Yes.

36:32.155 --> 36:35.683
You did what? I gave you a direct
order. That whitelighter was off-limits!

36:36.003 --> 36:41.135
You know what? I am sick and tired
of your orders. We both are.

36:41.736 --> 36:43.079
Stay out of my feelings.

36:43.179 --> 36:45.043
Oh, are those your feelings?

36:45.144 --> 36:48.992
Hell, yes, those are my feelings.
You boss us around like we're idiots.

36:50.074 --> 36:53.081
What? She thinks we are idiots.

36:53.402 --> 36:55.146
- I didn't say that.
- I bet she felt it.

36:55.246 --> 36:58.894
- My little empath feels everything.
- He's right. You despise us.

36:59.255 --> 37:03.223
In fact, until I became an empath,
I never realized how you truly hate us.

37:03.584 --> 37:06.250
You know what? Come on, baby,
let's go. Who needs them?

37:06.350 --> 37:07.613
You're not going anywhere.

37:07.713 --> 37:09.858
We gotta stick together
or our plan falls apart.

37:09.958 --> 37:11.963
See? There you go, bossing again.

37:13.085 --> 37:16.352
Just let the little chippy run off,
if that's what she wants.

37:16.453 --> 37:18.577
Don't call me a chippy!

37:19.139 --> 37:21.043
Don't push me!

37:21.143 --> 37:23.147
Just shut up!

37:31.847 --> 37:34.372
You should be able
to handle these women now.

37:39.664 --> 37:41.648
Not the nose, please.

37:41.748 --> 37:43.933
I think you have
something that's mine.

37:44.033 --> 37:46.900
Sure, it's yours.
Anything you want.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.004
Thank you.

37:51.009 --> 37:53.113
I take it this was all your doing.

37:53.214 --> 37:54.637
You're the one who got me here.

37:54.737 --> 37:56.160
How did you know they weren't us?

37:56.260 --> 37:58.766
Well, in all my life, I've never
seen you take the bait

37:58.866 --> 38:01.111
the way that witch took it from you.

38:01.993 --> 38:05.280
In all your life? You've only been
our whitelighter for two months.

38:05.601 --> 38:07.605
Let's just reverse the magic.

38:08.968 --> 38:12.657
<i>"Powers of the witches, rise</i>
<i>Course unseen across the skies</i>

38:13.017 --> 38:16.786
<i>Come to us, who call you near</i>
<i>Come to us and settle here"</i>

38:33.262 --> 38:36.309
So we binded their powers
and handed them over to Morris.

38:36.629 --> 38:39.376
There's enough evidence across
the street to book them for murder.

38:39.476 --> 38:42.362
And if that doesn't stick,
they're wanted in eight other states.

38:44.367 --> 38:46.271
Looks like you two had a good time.

38:46.371 --> 38:48.836
Yeah. He loved
all the clouds up there.

38:48.937 --> 38:50.941
I bet.

38:53.026 --> 38:57.155
Well, he just finished a bottle.
He's probably ready for a nap.

38:59.239 --> 39:00.863
I should get going.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.947
Leo, wait.

39:03.048 --> 39:05.052
Don't go too far away
from Wyatt, okay?

39:05.854 --> 39:09.622
I mean, feel free to sneak in
and hold him any time I'm not around.

39:10.825 --> 39:12.829
Thanks.

39:15.074 --> 39:17.159
Leo, can I talk to you for a second?

39:18.121 --> 39:20.125
See you, buddy.

39:25.257 --> 39:26.960
There's a rumour
floating around up there

39:27.061 --> 39:29.586
that you got a lead on whoever
scattered your orbs.

39:30.228 --> 39:33.435
Yeah, I know. I floated it.

39:33.755 --> 39:35.760
You did?

39:36.762 --> 39:38.506
Why?

39:38.606 --> 39:40.611
To draw out the guilty party.

39:41.011 --> 39:43.397
- Did it work?
- You tell me.

39:43.497 --> 39:46.463
So far, you're the only one
to come forward with any questions.

39:47.225 --> 39:50.292
It's an interesting experiment. When
you find out who did it, let me know.

39:50.392 --> 39:54.120
Oh, I already know who did it, Chris.

39:55.123 --> 39:57.488
And when I get enough proof
to expose him...

39:59.131 --> 40:01.256
...you'll be the first one to know.

40:05.385 --> 40:07.710
I don't know why I keep running
into magic, but thanks to you two,

40:08.031 --> 40:11.318
I have my identity back
and the fruit packers are unionized.

40:11.639 --> 40:14.545
So for now, I'm just gonna go with it.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.871
However, you two
can't hurt people anymore.

40:16.971 --> 40:18.394
That's why I brought you here,

40:18.494 --> 40:20.859
so you can tinker away
to your heart's content.

40:22.663 --> 40:25.389
Well, have at it, little blue dudes.

40:40.302 --> 40:42.307
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:46.155 --> 40:47.378
Can we talk?

40:47.478 --> 40:49.643
- About?
- Us.

40:51.487 --> 40:53.732
I thought we tried that earlier.

40:54.934 --> 40:57.580
I was kind of hoping
we could forget about that.

40:58.542 --> 41:00.547
Okay.

41:02.712 --> 41:06.199
- You're still mad.
- No, no, actually, I'm confused.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.928
I swear, every time I see you, I never
know which Phoebe I'm gonna get.

41:10.248 --> 41:12.253
- You either wanna talk or you want...
- Yeah.

41:13.696 --> 41:15.239
I know.

41:15.339 --> 41:18.547
But I don't know
how to act around you either.

41:19.308 --> 41:21.693
You know, you fly in for a few days,

41:21.794 --> 41:24.259
and we're supposed to squeeze
everything that we're feeling

41:24.359 --> 41:27.045
for each other
in those few days, and it's just...

41:28.007 --> 41:30.373
It's just really hard.

41:32.337 --> 41:34.161
I know.

41:34.261 --> 41:37.067
And that's why I wanted
to go to dinner, you know.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.315
Just so we could talk.

41:41.196 --> 41:44.283
Figure out how we feel
about each other.

41:48.733 --> 41:50.236
How's your nose?

41:50.337 --> 41:52.080
My nose?

41:52.181 --> 41:54.947
Oh, yeah, my nose.

41:55.267 --> 41:57.272
It's pretty good.

41:57.633 --> 41:59.637
I'm a fast healer.

42:01.521 --> 42:04.668
Well, I should probably
let you get back to work, huh?

42:04.768 --> 42:06.472
What are you doing right now?

42:06.572 --> 42:08.116
Trying to make a classy exit.

42:08.216 --> 42:10.862
You wanna go to a classy lunch?

42:11.944 --> 42:13.728
We'll just...

42:13.828 --> 42:15.572
We'll talk.

42:15.672 --> 42:17.677
I'd love to.

42:27.699 --> 42:29.403
- Jason.
- Yeah.

42:29.503 --> 42:31.507
Thanks for my diamonds.
