00:24.640 --> 00:26.190
?hey lover

00:26.600 --> 00:28.210
?he suppose to followe me out

00:28.600 --> 00:29.499
In a minute.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.634
I was thinking of actually getting
some showering done in here first.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.534
ANNOUNCER:
In February, 1996,

00:41.567 --> 00:44.599
the police in Portland, Oregon
were no closer to finding

00:44.600 --> 00:46.533
the so-called Suitcase Killer

00:46.567 --> 00:48.468
than they had been
11 months earlier

00:48.500 --> 00:51.633
when the first of his
six victims was found--

00:51.667 --> 00:55.799
dismembered and stuffed
inside a suitcase.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.099
They sought the assistance

00:57.100 --> 00:59.867
of FBI criminal profiler
Edward Cooper.

00:59.901 --> 01:01.703
Cooper's insights
led the police

01:01.707 --> 01:04.940
to a failed dental student
named Richard Gomez.

01:04.974 --> 01:08.849
A search of Gomez's apartment
yielded the bloody handsaw

01:08.850 --> 01:11.650
that he used to dismember his
victims... (man whistling tune)

01:11.683 --> 01:13.517
During Gomez's trial...
You better hurry up.

01:13.550 --> 01:14.884
a bureaucratic error
compromised the prosecution.

01:14.916 --> 01:16.850
I'm getting pretty into this
show, you might lose me.

01:16.884 --> 01:18.999
The bloody handsaw
was misplaced.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.833
Civic employees scoured
the evidence storage room

01:21.866 --> 01:24.266
but they were never able
to locate it.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.899
Richard Gomez was acquitted.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.199
Richard Gomez murdered
those young women.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.315
There's no doubt about that.

01:33.316 --> 01:34.883
Seeing him walk free...

01:36.000 --> 01:38.100
I'm not sure I can describe what
that feels like.

01:38.134 --> 01:39.600
To this day,

01:39.633 --> 01:43.000
no one knows the present
whereabouts of Richard Gomez.

01:43.034 --> 01:46.301
The serial killer
who scoffed at the law.

01:46.333 --> 01:52.633
(man whistling
"Strangers in the Night" )

01:52.667 --> 01:54.633
Why'd you shut it off?

01:57.700 --> 01:59.449
I was watching that.

01:59.450 --> 02:02.050
(screaming)

02:02.366 --> 02:06.234
(Joe whistling
"Strangers in the Night")

02:06.267 --> 02:09.598
(shower running)

02:09.600 --> 02:14.434
Hey, songbird, you think you
could keep the whistling down?

02:15.500 --> 02:18.732
I'm trying to have
a nightmare in here.

02:18.733 --> 02:33.733
www.1000fr.com Present

03:12.900 --> 03:14.500
Mommy, the syrup's cold.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.601
That's okay,
the waffles are hot.

03:16.634 --> 03:17.999
Eat them both at the same time,
you got warm.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.334
Guys, when you're done, bring
all your dishes to the sink.

03:23.300 --> 03:23.999
ARIEL:
Hey, what's Marie doing?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
There's nothing
on that channel.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.499
Give me the remote.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.834
No, Marie likes it.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.249
And why can't she get
to pick sometimes?

03:31.250 --> 03:33.099
She also like smearing
jelly all over her face,

03:33.100 --> 03:34.249
but that doesn't mean
we should let her.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.916
So give me
the remote.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.083
JOE: You know what,
give me the remote.

03:39.116 --> 03:40.299
It's morning, it's breakfast,

03:40.300 --> 03:42.999
it's way too early
to be fighting over television.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
It's way too early
for television period.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.782
Right, Mommy?

03:49.783 --> 03:52.099
Um, why aren't you guys
watching TV?

03:52.100 --> 03:54.067
Daddy said no.

03:56.183 --> 03:58.749
Hey, let Marie pick
for a change.

03:58.783 --> 04:01.016
Turn it up.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.783
I had a dream about
this guy last night.

04:07.816 --> 04:09.150
Oh, yeah?

04:09.183 --> 04:10.999
What's he got that I don't?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.100
As an amazing reputation

04:12.200 --> 04:15.199
as a criminal profiler
for one thing.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.867
I read this book in college
for a criminology course.

04:18.350 --> 04:19.949
Hmm...

04:19.950 --> 04:21.548
And the dream?

04:21.550 --> 04:24.300
It was about an old
case of his from years ago--

04:24.450 --> 04:25.799
Richard Gomez.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.299
And the girl, the victim,

04:28.300 --> 04:30.615
her picture's
no where in here.

04:31.616 --> 04:34.999
She doesn't look anything like
any of the people in here.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.332
Sorry. (chuckles)

04:36.616 --> 04:38.582
That's okay.

04:38.616 --> 04:41.999
I think I just decided
to become a vegetarian.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.533
(phone rings)

04:44.400 --> 04:45.967
Allison Dubois.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.782
I'm sorry, you've reached
the wrong extension.

04:49.783 --> 04:52.183
Sure, I can transfer you.

04:52.450 --> 04:53.699
Actually, I can
see from here

04:53.700 --> 04:56.100
the District Attorney's
not in his office.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.133
I believe he's in a conference.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.249
DEVALOS:
Yes.

05:01.250 --> 05:04.116
Sorry to interrupt... sir.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.229
Allison, what?

05:10.230 --> 05:11.749
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.399
I have a message for you.
He said it was important.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.700
He's only going to be there
another half hour.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.099
Uh-huh.

05:17.133 --> 05:20.233
Um, oh, forgive me, I'm sorry.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.399
Allison Dubois,
this is Special...

05:22.400 --> 05:25.733
ALLISON:
Edward Cooper of the FBI.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.766
I'm very familiar
with your work, sir.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.633
It's an honor
to meet you.

05:29.780 --> 05:32.547
And what is it you do
for the District Attorney

05:32.600 --> 05:34.400
that makes you so familiar
with my work?

05:34.550 --> 05:37.499
Uh, Allison was studying
law and criminology

05:37.500 --> 05:38.579
when she came to work for us,

05:38.580 --> 05:40.249
and while she doesn't
actually have a law degree,

05:40.250 --> 05:43.300
she's proven to be a very effective
resource when it comes to jury selection.

05:43.335 --> 05:45.850
Pretty good with crime
scene analysis as well.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.149
I see.

05:48.150 --> 05:49.583
Jury selection, huh?

05:49.600 --> 05:50.499
Yeah.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.368
Well, you must be a good judge
of human nature.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.500
Keen sense of intuition?

05:55.500 --> 05:56.933
You might like to join us.

05:56.979 --> 06:00.250
Actually, I need
to return this call

06:00.285 --> 06:02.749
and go over a few things
with Allison myself.

06:02.750 --> 06:05.950
Maybe we can reconvene
back here in say ten minutes?

06:11.100 --> 06:13.499
Edward Cooper! Oh, my God! Yes.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.733
That's so strange-- I had
a dream about him last night.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.267
As you probably figured
out by now,

06:17.300 --> 06:20.150
Agent Cooper and his staff are
going to be using the conference room

06:20.185 --> 06:21.665
as their temporary
base of operations.

06:21.666 --> 06:23.200
They're in town on a case.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.199
But to be honest
with you,

06:26.200 --> 06:27.249
I was sort of hoping

06:27.250 --> 06:29.400
that you wouldn't
run into each other.

06:29.850 --> 06:30.299
Why?

06:30.300 --> 06:32.266
I don't know. The man
makes me very nervous.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.166
Anyway, I know I don't
really need to tell you this,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.399
but we need to be especially
discrete about what it is

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
you really do here,

06:38.433 --> 06:39.900
and how you do it.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.999
Hey, as long as I can
sit in the room.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.699
As you all know, three days ago

06:43.733 --> 06:46.000
a jogger found the body
of Diane Colquitt

06:46.033 --> 06:48.966
on a path in Boyce Park
here in Phoenix.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.633
Diane was a
16-year-old prostitute.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.033
Appears that someone
picked her up,

06:53.066 --> 06:54.933
drove her to the park,

06:54.966 --> 06:57.249
and then strangled her
with own underwear.

06:57.250 --> 07:01.865
Every detail of Diane's killing
matches a series

07:01.866 --> 07:04.732
of murders the Bureau and I
are investigating

07:04.866 --> 07:06.349
up in Columbus, Ohio.

07:06.350 --> 07:08.849
Four young girls dead,

07:09.099 --> 07:10.400
all of them prostitutes,

07:10.433 --> 07:13.499
all of them strangled
with their own undergarments.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.266
All of them found
hands bound behind their back

07:16.450 --> 07:18.151
with a sailor's hitch knot.

07:18.250 --> 07:22.049
Every girl dumped facedown
on a jogging path.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.017
When was the last killing
in Ohio?

07:24.533 --> 07:26.349
Little over ten weeks ago.

07:26.350 --> 07:28.850
So you're thinking
that your killer migrated

07:28.885 --> 07:30.399
from the Midwest to here?

07:30.400 --> 07:31.999
Killers aren't immune
to the cold.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.867
They've been known to travel
south for the winter.

07:34.150 --> 07:36.000
This is a very preliminary

07:36.035 --> 07:37.368
psychological profile
of the killer.

07:38.233 --> 07:40.999
It appears that he is threatened
by women.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.299
Based on the forensic
evidence recovered

07:43.300 --> 07:45.200
from the four Ohio victims,

07:45.550 --> 07:48.117
we believe that he prefers
to have sex with his victims

07:48.200 --> 07:49.800
only after they're dead.

07:50.266 --> 07:52.149
Has he left any bodily fluids
behind?

07:52.150 --> 07:53.885
Any DNA to work from?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.149
No.

07:55.150 --> 07:57.016
He's methodical about cleaning
up after himself.

07:57.866 --> 08:00.649
Extraordinarily thorough,
which makes me suspect

08:00.650 --> 08:03.083
he's had a lot of practice
doing what he does.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.499
I have an appointment with the
coroner to personally examine

08:07.500 --> 08:10.267
Diane Colquitt's remains.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.599
My team and I will be there
at 3:00.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.900
Anyone from this office
that would care to join us,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.366
please do so.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.999
JOE: I'm sorry to stick you
with babysitting duty, honey.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.249
Mommy called me
at the last minute

08:22.250 --> 08:23.617
to pick you guys up.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.999
I got to get back to work.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
We'll be okay, Daddy.
Bridgette and I have homework

08:27.035 --> 08:27.948
and Marie can just sit

08:27.949 --> 08:30.450
with us and watch television.
Police, fire, doctor--

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
all the numbers you need
are on the fridge.

08:32.534 --> 08:33.799
Look, it's your favorite show.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.332
You have my cell phone,
you have Mommy's cell phone.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.433
One of us will be home by 5:30
at the absolute latest.

08:38.466 --> 08:40.499
Daddy, I've got it
under control.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.499
Okay, we've got to find
something better

08:41.500 --> 08:43.400
for her to watch than this.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.800
Back, back, back, back, back.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.333
Huh, what's wrong, sweetie?

08:50.366 --> 08:51.732
She likes the other one.

08:51.766 --> 08:53.633
There's nothing on
the other channel.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.633
Back, back, back,

08:54.667 --> 08:56.633
back, back.

09:01.933 --> 09:02.966
Told you.

09:02.999 --> 09:04.400
WOMAN:
As you indicated on the phone,

09:04.433 --> 09:08.299
the victim had been fairly
well cleaned up by her attacker,

09:08.300 --> 09:11.549
but we did pull this
off her underwear.

09:11.550 --> 09:12.816
It's dog hair.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.067
Looks to me like something
from the terrier family.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.899
COOPER: Her fingernails have been cut.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.279
Someone wanted to be sure
that we didn't find

09:32.280 --> 09:34.414
any DNA
under them.

09:34.999 --> 09:36.849
This bruise on
her shoulder

09:36.850 --> 09:38.713
is probably from
the killer's knee.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.466
Perhaps forensics
could analyze it...

09:40.500 --> 09:44.999
(man whistling
"Strangers in the Night")

09:45.033 --> 09:47.166
...what the killer was wearing
on the lower half of his body--

09:47.200 --> 09:48.999
denims, chinos...

09:49.000 --> 09:50.667
Excuse me.

09:51.250 --> 09:54.749
I was just wondering...
when you said earlier

09:54.750 --> 09:56.449
we were dealing with an
experienced perpetrator--

09:56.450 --> 09:58.816
someone who was good
at what he did,

09:59.200 --> 10:02.567
who clearly had a lot of...
practice,

10:03.166 --> 10:05.799
I wonder if anyone had
considered the possibility

10:05.832 --> 10:08.099
that the man who did this,
the man we're looking for,

10:08.100 --> 10:09.833
might be Richard Gomez.

10:10.832 --> 10:14.200
(clearing throat)

10:14.233 --> 10:16.000
Richard Gomez...

10:16.001 --> 10:19.135
No, we had not considered
Richard Gomez.

10:19.250 --> 10:22.050
Frankly, to the best
of my knowledge,

10:22.799 --> 10:26.799
Richard Gomez has been inactive
for more than ten years.

10:26.832 --> 10:28.999
Any particular reason
you bring his name up?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.700
Just, uh, a hunch.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.500
Instinct.

10:34.533 --> 10:35.899
A hunch.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.899
You know what I call a hunch
made without a scientific basis?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.449
You know what I call
an instinct

10:42.450 --> 10:45.450
uninformed by either experience
or intellect?

10:46.280 --> 10:47.980
I call it a distraction.

10:48.668 --> 10:51.368
I call it a waste of time.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.149
Forensics also might be able

10:53.150 --> 10:55.849
to speculate as to
the perpetrator's weight

10:55.850 --> 10:57.983
based on the depth
of the bruise.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.100
Correct me if I'm wrong...

10:59.668 --> 11:00.999
Happily.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Gomez is still at large,
is he not?

11:03.601 --> 11:05.701
How can you be so sure
this is not his work?

11:05.735 --> 11:06.599
What would prevent him

11:06.600 --> 11:09.934
from killing and raping
these women in Ohio?

11:10.580 --> 11:12.349
Seems to me if he's
still out there...

11:12.350 --> 11:14.583
Mrs. Dubois...

11:14.950 --> 11:17.349
you indicated that you were
familiar with my work.

11:17.350 --> 11:19.584
If that's truly the case,
then you know

11:20.250 --> 11:22.850
that Richard Gomez
was a dominance killer.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.067
He used his charm
and good looks

11:26.501 --> 11:28.999
to convince women to go back
to his home

11:29.000 --> 11:31.333
or a motel room--
somewhere private,

11:31.500 --> 11:35.500
where he would violate them,
torture them

11:35.580 --> 11:39.414
and keep them alive while he
sawed them into little pieces.

11:39.801 --> 11:43.249
He was a passionate
sadist.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.999
He took pleasure in their pain.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.529
This killer--
the Lincoln Park killer,

11:48.530 --> 11:49.549
he strikes from behind.

11:49.550 --> 11:53.000
It's more of a blitzkrieg
style of attack.

11:53.035 --> 11:55.679
It's the mark of a timid
personality, a coward.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.947
These two men might as well
speak different languages.

12:01.850 --> 12:04.599
Now, any other dormant
serial killers

12:04.600 --> 12:06.167
that you're curious about?

12:08.234 --> 12:11.833
Any other hunches,
any other random instincts?

12:17.000 --> 12:21.367
?perhaps we can continue to the
important working hand?

12:25.780 --> 12:27.814
, It was so mortifying. (water running)

12:28.000 --> 12:29.566
He was so cutting.

12:29.599 --> 12:31.283
He was so convinced
of his own infallibility,

12:31.317 --> 12:33.832
he wouldn't even
consider the possibility.

12:33.833 --> 12:37.666
Mmm... yeah. I think you need
to cut the guy a little slack.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.399
He's been catching killers
for what, 30 years?

12:40.400 --> 12:42.233
Now, you spent a
couple hours with the guy,

12:42.267 --> 12:43.549
and all of a sudden
you're bringing up

12:43.550 --> 12:45.216
his most famous setback.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.299
He's bound to get
a little testy.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.267
What does he have
to get testy about?

12:51.780 --> 12:55.765
Agent Cooper led the police
right to Richard Gomez.

12:55.766 --> 12:56.933
He did his job.

12:56.967 --> 12:58.900
It's not his fault
somebody lost the evidence.

12:58.933 --> 13:02.400
You're right, but maybe Cooper
doesn't see it that way.

13:02.434 --> 13:06.267
Catching these people is pretty
much a crusade for him, right?

13:06.300 --> 13:08.200
So when one of
them slips away,

13:08.233 --> 13:10.700
I doubt he spends much
time consoling himself

13:10.733 --> 13:12.933
with the idea that he is
not personally to blame.

13:12.967 --> 13:16.267
Well, that doesn't give him the
right to make a fool out of me.

13:18.967 --> 13:22.800
Are you using this
arm for anything?

13:31.666 --> 13:33.900
GOMEZ:
Why'd you shut it off?

13:37.466 --> 13:39.000
I was watching that.

13:39.033 --> 13:41.434
(screaming)

13:48.533 --> 13:51.833
(strained screaming)

13:54.000 --> 13:56.833
(pained yells)

14:10.733 --> 14:12.733
(Gomez grunts, Allison gasps)

14:26.866 --> 14:27.833
(knocking)

14:27.866 --> 14:28.833
Yup.

14:28.866 --> 14:29.833
Sorry to bother you.

14:29.866 --> 14:32.133
I need your help.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.334
What does this mean?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.434
Dioner Mapache--
it's a name.

14:37.466 --> 14:38.900
It's a man's name.

14:38.933 --> 14:40.566
Uh... first name Dioner,
last name Mapache.

14:40.599 --> 14:41.833
Why do you ask?

14:41.866 --> 14:43.866
Actually, I think
it's a business,

14:43.900 --> 14:45.267
like a bar or restaurant,

14:45.300 --> 14:48.900
the kind of business that
advertises on hotel ashtrays.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.233
Wherever this business is,

14:50.267 --> 14:51.900
I think it's located
nearby the hotel

14:51.933 --> 14:56.599
where... Richard Gomez
killed Diane Colquitt.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.233
(sighs)

15:00.267 --> 15:01.300
Close my office door, Allison.

15:08.000 --> 15:08.565
(door closes)

15:08.566 --> 15:09.733
What are you doing?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.765
Just what I always do.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.299
But I believe
Agent Cooper

15:13.300 --> 15:14.999
made it perfectly clear
that he's not interested

15:15.000 --> 15:17.633
in any leads involving
Richard Gomez.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.666
That he feels very strongly
that Richard Gomez

15:19.700 --> 15:21.367
had nothing to do
with this woman's death.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.633
Well, he's wrong.

15:22.666 --> 15:24.633
Allison...

15:24.666 --> 15:26.233
(sighs)

15:29.550 --> 15:31.632
All right.

15:31.633 --> 15:33.466
All right. Let me...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.166
see if I can try and get
Detective Scanlon

15:36.167 --> 15:37.866
to discretely
run this down, find out

15:37.900 --> 15:39.566
if there is such a place
and where it might be,

15:39.599 --> 15:43.000
but do me a favor-- stay away
from the conference room.

15:43.033 --> 15:43.999
Keep out of
Cooper's way.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.568
Let's let him think that you've
moved on to something else.

15:47.100 --> 15:49.900
Let's let him think
that you're doing other things.

15:54.599 --> 15:55.549
Huh.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.558
Okay.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.399
The government
wants the chassis

15:59.400 --> 16:01.999
to be made
with light polymer.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.999
They also want it
to hold six cameras,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.332
but if you put six cameras
on it, the light polymer

16:07.780 --> 16:10.546
won't stand up
to atmospheric pressure

16:10.579 --> 16:12.147
which means we've got...

16:12.180 --> 16:13.546
Nothing.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.734
(head thumping)

16:21.101 --> 16:22.700
Are we taking a break?

16:22.734 --> 16:24.567
(head thumping)

16:27.300 --> 16:28.768
I think we're
taking a break.

16:31.768 --> 16:33.934
Deep breaths, Aaron.

16:33.968 --> 16:36.868
Pretend we're not days
away from our deadline.

16:39.034 --> 16:41.001
Think happy thoughts.

16:41.550 --> 16:44.017
Can you think happy
thoughts for me?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.333
What are you
thinking about?

16:50.250 --> 16:51.779
A.J. just turned three.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.599
There you go.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.567
My youngest just
turned three, too.

16:59.550 --> 17:01.851
And now you say
something back.

17:01.950 --> 17:03.850
Pretty soon we're
having small talk.

17:03.950 --> 17:06.717
That's how a break works.

17:07.349 --> 17:09.329
A.J. likes to
eat Play-Doh.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.997
Congratulations.
You must be very proud.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.583
Marie sits in front
of the TV and watches static.

17:15.584 --> 17:17.617
I think she'd do it
for hours at a time

17:17.651 --> 17:18.915
if we'd let her.

17:23.623 --> 17:25.923
What?

17:26.284 --> 17:27.250
Nothing.

17:27.284 --> 17:29.584
It's...

17:29.617 --> 17:31.279
It's none of my business.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.680
I'm sure
it's nothing.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.766
You can't just say that.
What's nothing?

17:36.300 --> 17:37.899
You say your daughter
just stares

17:37.900 --> 17:39.533
at a blank channel for hours?

17:40.800 --> 17:42.399
Well, like I said,
it's probably nothing,

17:42.400 --> 17:45.867
and I certainly don't mean
to alarm you, but...

17:46.280 --> 17:48.913
my brother has
an autistic son.

17:49.217 --> 17:51.751
That sounds like the kind
of thing he used to do.

17:52.783 --> 17:54.750
It doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

17:54.751 --> 17:57.083
It's... It's
probably nothing.

17:59.617 --> 18:01.183
Yeah.

18:08.270 --> 18:09.703
(elevator bell dings)

18:22.150 --> 18:24.384
Bad hunch, huh?

18:31.280 --> 18:32.446
His name is Warren Bell.

18:32.950 --> 18:34.217
He was in your
local registry

18:34.251 --> 18:35.251
of sex offenders.

18:35.284 --> 18:37.518
One of my people
remembered his face.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.949
Back in Columbus, we questioned
him about the murders.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.482
We just... couldn't find

18:41.550 --> 18:43.351
any evidence to tie
him to the crime.

18:43.917 --> 18:46.684
And now he's
here in Phoenix?

18:46.718 --> 18:48.384
Well, he's a
sex offender.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.549
He's obligated to register

18:49.550 --> 18:51.517
whenever he moves
into a new community.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.083
I asked them to bring
him in for questioning.

18:53.850 --> 18:55.349
Sure you wouldn't
like to stick around?

18:55.350 --> 18:56.451
You might find
it fascinating.

18:57.184 --> 18:58.684
Me? You think so?

18:58.718 --> 18:59.899
I don't know.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.499
I think I probably lack the
experience and the intellect

19:02.500 --> 19:05.134
to really appreciate whatever
it is you're gonna do or say.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.133
Besides, I wouldn't want
to be a distraction.

19:08.384 --> 19:10.785
I wouldn't want
to waste your time.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.234
Want to know who
Dioner Mapache is?

19:20.250 --> 19:21.384
You found it already?

19:21.751 --> 19:23.349
It's kind of an
interesting story.

19:23.350 --> 19:25.650
Turns out he was a general
in the Mexican army,

19:25.651 --> 19:27.751
killed by his own men
the night before a battle.

19:27.785 --> 19:29.885
Given his less-than-
inspiring history,

19:29.917 --> 19:30.999
I guess it isn't a surprise

19:31.000 --> 19:32.279
there's only one
restaurant anywhere

19:32.280 --> 19:33.246
that's named after him.

19:33.718 --> 19:34.849
It's in Mexico,

19:34.850 --> 19:36.951
half a block away from
the El Coyote motel.

19:38.751 --> 19:40.351
Would this be the
scene of the crime?

19:40.384 --> 19:41.351
Yeah.

19:41.384 --> 19:43.217
This is the place
I saw in my dream.

19:43.251 --> 19:44.899
I called the motel,
asked them if they'd had

19:44.900 --> 19:47.250
any suspicious activity
there lately, if anyone

19:47.285 --> 19:49.917
matching Richard Gomez's
description had checked in.

19:50.184 --> 19:52.950
Turns out there was someone
matching Gomez's description.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.669
You're kidding.
I knew it.

19:54.670 --> 19:56.099
We gotta tell Cooper.
I can't wait to see the look

19:56.100 --> 19:57.600
on that egomaniac's face.

19:57.635 --> 19:59.500
Nine years ago.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.549
1997.

20:02.550 --> 20:03.999
He checked in
under a false name,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.818
he wasn't carrying a wallet.

20:05.851 --> 20:07.917
They had no way
to establish his identity.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.239
What are you talking about,
no way to establish his...?

20:11.240 --> 20:12.699
I'm trying to tell you
that there was a murder

20:12.700 --> 20:14.667
at the El Coyote motel in 1997,

20:15.250 --> 20:18.549
only Richard Gomez wasn't
the killer, he was the victim.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.750
Looks like robbers tied Gomez

20:20.785 --> 20:22.383
to a chair while they
ransacked the place.

20:22.384 --> 20:24.651
They took what they wanted,
then put two bullets in him.

20:24.684 --> 20:26.217
Cops thought it might
have been drug-related.

20:26.251 --> 20:27.800
I don't know what
to tell you, Allison.

20:27.801 --> 20:30.549
I mean, unless he's unusually
spry for a rotting corpse,

20:30.550 --> 20:32.299
I think it's fairly safe to say
that Richard Gomez

20:32.300 --> 20:33.600
?it is not the leading part killer

20:41.317 --> 20:43.151
Joe?

20:43.700 --> 20:44.999
Where are the girls?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.199
Homework.

20:49.783 --> 20:51.416
Okay.

20:51.449 --> 20:53.082
And what are you doing?

20:53.116 --> 20:55.049
I'm watching our daughter
watch her favorite channel.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.583
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.633
What channel?

21:02.223 --> 21:03.081
That's what
I thought, too,

21:03.082 --> 21:06.416
that she just likes to
watch nothing, static,

21:06.530 --> 21:07.582
but I was wrong.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.100
She just likes to watch
this particular channel.

21:10.135 --> 21:12.216
Channel 282.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.014
You want to know what happens
when I try to change the channel

21:15.015 --> 21:17.569
to another channel
that just has static on it?

21:17.570 --> 21:18.870
She starts to cry.

21:19.550 --> 21:20.715
Want me to show you?

21:20.716 --> 21:23.549
No, I don't need you to prove
you can make our daughter cry.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.683
Why are you doing this?

21:24.982 --> 21:26.383
I'm trying to learn.

21:26.416 --> 21:27.716
I'm trying to understand.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.249
Watch this.

21:29.282 --> 21:32.583
Hey, sweetie, what are
you watching on the TV?

21:32.616 --> 21:33.716
Funny man.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.915
Funny man?

21:34.949 --> 21:36.783
What is the funny man doing?

21:36.816 --> 21:38.316
Talk to me.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.099
Talking to her.

21:45.416 --> 21:46.299
All right, babe, come on.

21:46.300 --> 21:47.733
It's time to brush
your teeth.

21:49.816 --> 21:51.383
I'll meet you in there
in a minute, cupcake.

21:51.416 --> 21:54.750
Go on.

21:54.783 --> 21:56.583
All right, once again,
what are you doing?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.582
What am I doing?

21:58.583 --> 22:00.716
Are you okay with this?
This doesn't bother you?

22:01.750 --> 22:02.981
You're not in
the least bit curious

22:02.982 --> 22:05.416
what the funny man might
be saying to her?

22:05.449 --> 22:07.049
What he might be showing her?

22:07.082 --> 22:07.849
She's three.

22:07.850 --> 22:08.700
Exactly.

22:08.735 --> 22:09.500
What does that mean?

22:09.535 --> 22:10.968
It means it's not normal.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.439
She has an
imagination.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.040
Maybe.
Or maybe it's something else.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.049
I'd like to have her tested.

22:18.082 --> 22:20.116
Tested for what?
I don't know.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.981
Autism.

22:22.982 --> 22:24.549
She does not
have autism.

22:24.583 --> 22:25.850
How do you know?
You don't know.

22:25.882 --> 22:29.149
I know. I know my baby.
I know my daughter.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.949
Oh, yeah? Well, do you know
what she's seeing on that TV?

22:31.982 --> 22:34.683
No. And I don't think
it matters. Well, I do.

22:34.716 --> 22:37.850
I mean, you see things
that aren't there sometimes,

22:37.882 --> 22:40.750
and, most of the time,
they're not pretty to look at.

22:40.783 --> 22:42.082
They're not
the kind of things

22:42.116 --> 22:44.683
that you'd want
a three-year-old to see.

22:44.716 --> 22:47.599
Okay, I'm just trying
to understand this.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.667
Are you hoping she doesn't
have autism or that she does?

22:50.982 --> 22:53.949
Okay. I'm done
having this conversation.

22:53.950 --> 22:55.199
Oh, that's
a great answer.

22:55.200 --> 22:55.999
I'll be in the shower.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.014
You know, if it
bothers you so much,

22:58.065 --> 22:59.415
maybe you should
just read to her

22:59.416 --> 23:01.882
instead of sitting her
in front of the TV.

23:01.915 --> 23:04.649
(door closes)

23:07.449 --> 23:11.116
COOPER:
August 22, 1996.

23:11.149 --> 23:12.850
Excuse me?

23:13.230 --> 23:16.014
That's the day that
Richard Gomez was acquitted.

23:16.322 --> 23:20.348
I mark the anniversary
in my calendar every year.

23:20.770 --> 23:22.914
My wife has learned
to avoid me on that date.

23:22.915 --> 23:25.716
She says that I'm
a world-class brooder.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.682
But now,
because of you,

23:28.683 --> 23:32.516
August 22 is freed up for
more productive pursuits.

23:33.549 --> 23:34.881
Thank you,
Mrs. Dubois.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.215
A lot of people will
sleep easier tonight

23:37.216 --> 23:40.015
because they know that
Richard Gomez is dead.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.648
I accused you of
wasting my time,

23:46.649 --> 23:48.416
of being a distraction.

23:48.449 --> 23:51.182
I stand corrected.

23:51.216 --> 23:54.349
You have
terrific instincts.

23:55.800 --> 23:56.615
I wish I had

23:56.616 --> 23:59.182
been wise enough
to understand

23:59.216 --> 24:00.549
what they were
trying to tell me.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.782
Thank you.
Although, to be honest,

24:02.783 --> 24:03.899
I really wish
they would steer me

24:03.900 --> 24:05.750
towards
the Lincoln Park Killer.

24:05.785 --> 24:07.249
Well, might
not be too late

24:07.282 --> 24:09.383
for you to pitch in.

24:09.416 --> 24:11.915
We couldn't locate
Warren Bell yesterday.

24:11.949 --> 24:14.349
He finally showed up at
his apartment this morning.

24:14.383 --> 24:15.999
They're bringing
him in now.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.900
I'm headed over
to interview him.

24:18.182 --> 24:19.949
Appreciate it
if you'd sit in

24:19.982 --> 24:23.915
and give me the benefit
of your expertise.

24:23.949 --> 24:26.583
I already told your men
back at my apartment.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.648
I was home watching TV
the night that girl died.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.482
Can anyone
confirm that?

24:32.780 --> 24:35.981
No. I was alone
the whole time.

24:35.982 --> 24:38.850
Nobody called?
Nobody came by?

24:40.349 --> 24:43.116
COOPER:
You watch a lot of TV, Warren.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.482
I remember, when we met
back in Columbus,

24:46.483 --> 24:47.849
you said you were watching TV

24:47.850 --> 24:49.549
on the nights the women
there were killed, too.

24:50.250 --> 24:52.315
I live by myself.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.316
TV helps fill up the quiet.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.248
You up and
leave Columbus,

24:56.249 --> 24:57.882
the murders there stop,
you land in Phoenix,

24:57.915 --> 24:59.680
lo and behold,
girls start dying.

24:59.780 --> 25:00.849
I'm sure I'm not
the only person

25:00.850 --> 25:05.081
to move from Ohio to Arizona
in the past couple months.

25:05.082 --> 25:07.109
I got a job here.

25:07.110 --> 25:09.310
I registered my whereabouts.

25:10.288 --> 25:11.315
I'm allowed to move.

25:12.266 --> 25:14.499
You work as
an apartment manager.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.600
Am I remembering that right?

25:17.149 --> 25:19.249
Are you a dog owner,
Warren?

25:19.250 --> 25:20.883
No, I'm not.

25:22.000 --> 25:22.815
Are you sure?

25:24.000 --> 25:27.333
You seem
a little uncertain.

25:28.383 --> 25:31.149
Can't smoke in here, Warren.

25:53.243 --> 25:56.011
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.233
(dog whimpering)

26:04.867 --> 26:06.700
(sizzling, dog yipes)

26:08.800 --> 26:11.066
Excuse me.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.733
You all right?

26:37.767 --> 26:40.700
Thanks. I will be.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.099
I'm sorry I left the room.

26:43.100 --> 26:48.849
I found it hard
to be so close to that man.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.634
You have a hunch about him,
do you?

26:52.950 --> 26:56.099
He keeps a dog
chained up somewhere.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.700
It looks like a garage.

26:59.350 --> 27:00.799
He doesn't feed it.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.299
It's barely alive.

27:03.300 --> 27:06.633
He tortures it
with a burning cigarette.

27:11.600 --> 27:15.466
I've worked a couple
of missing children cases.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.100
Met people like you before.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.834
You see things, don't you?

27:25.733 --> 27:28.867
That must be quite a burden.

27:33.250 --> 27:37.717
A long time ago,
at the start of my career,

27:38.300 --> 27:41.999
I made a choice.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.199
I dedicated myself

27:43.200 --> 27:45.632
to getting inside
the minds of killers.

27:45.850 --> 27:47.883
To... going to worlds

27:48.300 --> 27:52.239
where other people wouldn't,
or couldn't.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.899
It's rarely been pleasant.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.634
And it's changed me.

27:59.780 --> 28:02.832
But it was still my choice.

28:03.250 --> 28:07.699
You, Mrs. Dubois...

28:07.700 --> 28:09.579
you go into
the heads of murderers

28:09.580 --> 28:11.147
whether you want to or not.

28:14.350 --> 28:18.465
I admire you.

28:18.466 --> 28:21.034
But I sure don't envy you.

28:28.466 --> 28:29.900
That one.

28:29.933 --> 28:31.649
Wise choice, my dear.

28:31.650 --> 28:34.249
See, she picked the one
with monsters and mayhem.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.083
She takes after
her mother.

28:36.900 --> 28:39.165
That's my girl.

28:39.166 --> 28:39.999
(telephone rings)

28:40.000 --> 28:41.267
Oh.

28:43.135 --> 28:44.469
And here we go.
Hello?

28:44.800 --> 28:46.199
Allison,
it's Manuel Devalos.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.634
I'm sorry to bother you at home,

28:47.680 --> 28:48.849
but I thought you'd like to know

28:48.850 --> 28:51.000
that the police have executed
a search warrant

28:51.035 --> 28:52.249
on Warren Bell's apartment.

28:52.250 --> 28:54.349
Did they find anything
that linked him to the murders?

28:54.350 --> 28:55.417
Not inside the apartment.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.533
But in a garage
that he had access to,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.100
we did find a grey
wire-haired terrier.

29:01.134 --> 29:02.999
My God, was he still alive?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.467
Barely. We took a sample
of its hair.

29:05.780 --> 29:08.669
Preliminary DNA tests indicate
that it's a match

29:08.670 --> 29:10.603
for the hair we found
on Diane Colquitt's body.

29:11.233 --> 29:13.299
We've placed Warren Bell
under arrest.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.749
That's great news, sir.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.899
Agent Cooper wanted me
to call you and to tell you,

29:17.900 --> 29:20.833
and to send his thanks.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.699
Allison? What does he know?

29:23.700 --> 29:26.433
Oh, I don't think
he "knows" anything.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.249
There's no denying he certainly
has strong instincts.

29:29.250 --> 29:33.199
Mmm. Well, I guess I'll see you
in the morning.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.033
See you in the morning.

29:37.667 --> 29:39.899
(humming)

29:39.900 --> 29:41.434
You look happy.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.466
(man singing in Spanish)

29:50.500 --> 29:52.281
What now?

29:52.282 --> 29:54.582
A leg or a breast?

29:54.933 --> 29:57.067
(door opens)

29:57.100 --> 29:59.633
Hello?

30:11.266 --> 30:13.433
You.

30:13.466 --> 30:15.433
How did-how did you find me?

30:17.466 --> 30:19.466
Wasn't easy.

30:23.867 --> 30:25.900
(gasps)

30:25.933 --> 30:27.333
(sighs)

30:28.750 --> 30:30.499
No wonder Cooper
was absolutely certain

30:30.500 --> 30:33.066
that Richard Gomez wasn't
the Lincoln Park Killer.

30:33.800 --> 30:34.999
I can't believe
I'm saying this...

30:35.000 --> 30:36.434
it's not hard
to understand.

30:37.134 --> 30:38.799
Imagine that you're him.

30:38.800 --> 30:42.700
You catch this guy,
you do everything you need to

30:42.735 --> 30:45.200
to be sure that he gets
the death penalty.

30:45.767 --> 30:48.533
And then... they set him free.

30:49.567 --> 30:53.000
He likes to kill, you know
he's going to do it again.

30:53.001 --> 30:54.099
You track him down.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.867
You rectify the situation.

30:58.500 --> 30:59.400
So if you understand it,

30:59.401 --> 31:01.001
what are we doing
here in our kitchen

31:01.034 --> 31:02.867
at 3:00 in the morning
talking about it?

31:03.800 --> 31:07.333
I just don't understand what
I'm supposed to do about it.

31:07.334 --> 31:09.800
Am I supposed to speak out?

31:09.834 --> 31:12.519
Ruin the life, the career,
of a good man

31:12.520 --> 31:13.999
just because he couldn't live
with the idea

31:14.000 --> 31:16.601
of Richard Gomez getting away
with murder?

31:16.850 --> 31:19.049
Six murders?

31:19.867 --> 31:23.900
Even if I wanted to tell
the world what Cooper had done,

31:24.280 --> 31:26.833
it all happened nine years ago.

31:26.834 --> 31:29.134
I doubt I could prove anything.

31:31.067 --> 31:32.479
You know what?
This is easy.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.480
Don't do anything.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.333
I'm completely
serious, Al.

31:36.334 --> 31:38.499
I mean besides, it's not
like you're absolutely certain

31:38.500 --> 31:39.633
that Cooper did it.

31:40.780 --> 31:42.399
He shot him once in the head.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.834
He shot him once in the stomach.

31:44.200 --> 31:44.999
I saw it, Joe.

31:45.000 --> 31:45.766
I know.

31:45.767 --> 31:48.800
But you also saw Richard Gomez
kill Diane Colquitt

31:48.835 --> 31:50.232
in that very
same room,

31:50.350 --> 31:52.665
and we both know
that didn't happen.

31:53.250 --> 31:56.217
My point is, your wires have
been a little crossed lately.

31:56.777 --> 31:59.499
And unless you're absolutely
certain that it's true,

31:59.500 --> 32:01.500
you can't a accuse a man
of murder.

32:02.101 --> 32:04.834
And even if you
were certain...

32:04.867 --> 32:07.709
I don't sense that you want
to accuse this particular man

32:07.710 --> 32:13.009
of this particular murder,
and I don't blame you.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.468
(inaudible shouting)

32:24.234 --> 32:26.267
(door slams)

32:37.000 --> 32:38.833
(heavy sigh)

32:45.777 --> 32:47.777
Thanks.

32:48.034 --> 32:50.549
I'm negotiating a deal
with Warren Bell's attorney.

32:50.550 --> 32:52.416
Agent Cooper doesn't like it.

32:52.934 --> 32:53.949
What kind of deal?

32:53.950 --> 32:55.949
We're offering to take
the death penalty off the table

32:55.950 --> 32:59.200
in exchange for a full
confession to all the murders.

33:00.300 --> 33:01.916
I've got a few pieces
of dog hair--

33:01.967 --> 33:03.479
it's not much to stand on
when you're asking a jury

33:03.480 --> 33:05.246
to sentence a man to death.

33:07.101 --> 33:09.000
Given the paucity
of corroborating evidence,

33:09.035 --> 33:11.599
I felt the full confession
was the best way to end this--

33:11.600 --> 33:13.999
take Bell off the street
for the rest of his life

33:14.000 --> 33:16.633
and bring closure
to the victims' families.

33:17.101 --> 33:20.167
I've spoken with the authorities
in Ohio-- they agree with me.

33:20.201 --> 33:22.958
Obviously, Agent Cooper
is advocating strongly

33:22.980 --> 33:24.850
for the pursuit
of the death penalty.

33:25.068 --> 33:28.467
I don't sense that he's
big on compromise.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.934
Noticed that, did you?

33:32.700 --> 33:34.449
Okay, well, it's clear what we
got to do-- we got to tell him

33:34.450 --> 33:35.916
that the satellite
can only carry one camera.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.359
AARON: Joe, this is a government
contract-- you sure you want

33:38.360 --> 33:39.794
to tell them
we can't meet their specs?

33:40.234 --> 33:42.109
No, I want to tell them that
their specs are fanciful,

33:42.110 --> 33:43.899
a creation of pure whimsy
on a par with the works

33:43.900 --> 33:45.720
of Lewis Carroll. MARIE: Airplane!

33:45.800 --> 33:47.749
But I can't do that,
so I'm just gonna tell them

33:47.750 --> 33:49.799
that the satellite
can only carry one camera.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.400
Airplane. Airplane.
Can you hold on a sec?

33:53.100 --> 33:56.467
Hey, Bridgette, did you
turn on the TV for your sister?

33:56.468 --> 33:57.999
BRIDGETTE:
She asked me to, Daddy.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.467
It's no problem. I was
just asking Airplane!

34:01.600 --> 34:02.900
Airplane!
if we should...

34:03.384 --> 34:05.384
Hey, Aaron, did your son
just say "airplane"?

34:06.468 --> 34:09.201
Uh, yeah. He's watching TV.
He is?

34:10.500 --> 34:11.565
He wouldn't happen
to be running around

34:11.567 --> 34:12.748
the room
with his arms spread out

34:12.750 --> 34:14.449
like a couple of wings,
would he?

34:14.600 --> 34:17.300
He is, actually. Why? Can you
tell me what he's watching?

34:17.667 --> 34:20.699
Otis the Octopus--
it's that show where the big guy

34:20.710 --> 34:22.417
in the fuzzy suit
makes him do jumping jacks...

34:22.418 --> 34:23.984
Sorry, what channel
is he watching?

34:24.067 --> 34:26.001
Nugget. You know,
the kid's channel.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.199
I'm glad he likes it--
it costs me $10.99 a month.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.233
So it's a premium station.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.884
Is that channel 282?

34:33.333 --> 34:34.567
I don't know, Joe.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.998
We're kind of
on a deadline here.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.033
Why are you so curious
about Nugget TV?

34:38.368 --> 34:40.579
C- Can you please tell me
if that is Channel 282?

34:40.580 --> 34:41.880
Okay.

34:42.266 --> 34:43.632
(cartoon music playing)

34:43.667 --> 34:45.632
Yeah, it's channel 282.
You happy?

34:45.667 --> 34:47.967
ALLISON: Hi. I'm home.
I came bearing pizza!

34:48.001 --> 34:48.899
Actually, I think I am.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.466
Listen, Aaron, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.467
Hey. What's up?
Hi.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.567
Hey.

34:57.550 --> 34:59.184
I have good news,
and I have bad news.

34:59.434 --> 35:01.567
(groans):
What are you talking about?

35:01.600 --> 35:02.967
What's the good news?

35:03.001 --> 35:06.267
Uh, I don't believe that
our daughter has autism.

35:06.301 --> 35:09.067
In fact, I don't believe it'll
actually be necessary for her

35:09.101 --> 35:10.099
to see a doctor at all.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.399
Well, that is good news.
And the bad news?

35:12.700 --> 35:14.600
I think she might
be a felon.

35:14.633 --> 35:16.387
Excuse me?

35:16.388 --> 35:18.755
I think she's
stealing cable.

35:19.167 --> 35:20.533
(door creaks softly)

35:20.567 --> 35:22.067
(light switch clicks)

35:59.067 --> 36:01.667
(phone rings)

36:02.000 --> 36:02.749
Hello?

36:02.750 --> 36:05.084
It's Edward Cooper.
Sorry to wake you, Mrs. Dubois.

36:05.434 --> 36:06.699
The district attorney
gave me your number.

36:06.700 --> 36:09.899
We both felt that you'd want
to hear about it right away.

36:10.533 --> 36:11.679
Hear about what?

36:11.680 --> 36:14.547
You might want
to turn on your TV.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.247
I don't know what to tell you.

36:18.633 --> 36:20.700
God bless America.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.299
Last night my attorney
was advising me to take a deal

36:24.300 --> 36:27.433
so that I could avoid going
on trial for my life.

36:27.934 --> 36:30.567
Then, at 5:00 this morning,
a prison guard

36:30.600 --> 36:33.767
is shaking me awake
and telling me I can go free.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.500
I don't understand.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.779
COOPER:
Well, as I understand it,

36:37.780 --> 36:40.280
Bell's lawyer asked
the prosecution to produce

36:40.315 --> 36:42.213
the evidence against his client.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.785
According to the law, they're
entitled to a second DNA test

36:45.786 --> 36:47.286
at a lab of their choice.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.532
Apparently, when they went

36:48.533 --> 36:51.233
to the evidence room
to retrieve the dog hair...

36:51.967 --> 36:53.267
it was gone.

36:53.450 --> 36:54.966
No one can find it.

36:55.780 --> 36:58.966
This is unbelievable.

36:59.250 --> 37:02.233
Do they have any idea
what might have happened to it?

37:02.234 --> 37:03.800
Not really.

37:03.834 --> 37:04.749
The district attorney thinks

37:04.750 --> 37:07.183
one of the clerks
must've screwed up.

37:08.225 --> 37:10.433
(sighs):
What do you think?

37:10.434 --> 37:12.567
I don't know.

37:13.011 --> 37:14.766
I don't know what to think.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.866
However it happened,
the evidence is gone,

37:17.867 --> 37:20.149
and without it,
there's no way to prove

37:20.150 --> 37:23.918
that Warren Bell was
the Lincoln Park Killer.

37:24.334 --> 37:25.834
He's a free man.

37:26.350 --> 37:26.899
BELL:
Of course, this is

37:26.900 --> 37:30.268
an enormous relief
for me and my family,

37:30.400 --> 37:31.699
and to anyone who wants to see

37:31.700 --> 37:34.000
the real Lincoln Park Killer
brought to justice.

37:35.334 --> 37:38.900
Like I said, God bless America.

37:44.750 --> 37:47.850
ALLISON: It must have
been hard to get rid of.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.754
The handsaw--
the one Richard Gomez used

37:54.787 --> 37:57.021
to cut his victims
into little pieces.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.480
I've been thinking about it--
it's kind of bulky.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.000
An awkward shape.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.800
It must have been hard for you
to get rid of.

38:03.900 --> 38:07.401
Unlike, say,
a few strands of dog hair.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.120
It sounds like you're accusing
me of something, Mrs. Dubois.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.299
I am. I am,

38:20.300 --> 38:21.933
because I know.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.367
I know what you did.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.999
I know you got rid of the
evidence against Richard Gomez.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.900
I know you tracked him
to Mexico.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.933
I know you put
two bullets into him.

38:32.950 --> 38:35.583
That's a colorful theory.

38:36.520 --> 38:39.220
I'm guessing you
can't prove any of it,

38:39.253 --> 38:41.119
or I'd be talking
to the police

38:41.153 --> 38:43.986
and not a... consultant.

38:44.019 --> 38:46.453
(wry chuckle)

38:46.487 --> 38:49.186
I am not gonna tell anyone

38:49.500 --> 38:52.100
about what you did to Gomez.

38:52.134 --> 38:53.759
I can carry around
that knowledge

38:53.760 --> 38:55.060
and live just fine.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.850
But knowing what
you are going to do,

38:59.500 --> 39:01.799
that I don't think
I can live with.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.533
I can't just step aside
and let that happen.

39:04.566 --> 39:07.249
So before you go through
with what you're planning,

39:07.250 --> 39:09.216
before you kill Warren Bell,

39:09.700 --> 39:12.499
you need to know
that I am on to you.

39:12.533 --> 39:14.966
I know what's coming.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.199
And I will find a way
to expose you.

39:18.232 --> 39:19.866
(exhales)

39:19.900 --> 39:24.133
You really are an extraordinary
woman, Mrs. Dubois.

39:24.167 --> 39:28.366
I can see why the district attorney
values your services so highly.

39:30.100 --> 39:35.501
As far as Warren Bell
is concerned, my guess is

39:35.534 --> 39:39.249
that... he'll keep his
nose clean for a while.

39:39.250 --> 39:41.916
He knows he's in the
spotlight right now.

39:41.949 --> 39:44.499
But someday...

39:44.500 --> 39:47.233
someday not too
far from now,

39:47.350 --> 39:50.249
the sickness that
lives inside him

39:50.700 --> 39:54.034
will make its way
back to the surface.

39:54.067 --> 39:56.499
He'll kill again.

39:56.500 --> 40:00.433
He won't be able
not to kill again.

40:02.667 --> 40:06.067
Unless something
happens to him.

40:06.101 --> 40:08.600
Unless the universe
intervenes.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.545
Maybe he'll wrap his car
around a telephone pole.

40:12.546 --> 40:15.746
Maybe he'll die in an
accident in his apartment.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.799
Who knows, maybe he'll
just... disappear.

40:20.250 --> 40:23.249
That happens
sometimes, too.

40:23.250 --> 40:28.317
My guess is, if something
like that does come to pass...

40:29.183 --> 40:33.116
you'll think about
Diane Colquitt,

40:33.150 --> 40:36.249
lying in a park with her panties
wrapped around her neck.

40:36.250 --> 40:39.750
You'll think about all
those dead girls in Ohio.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.349
Or maybe you'll
even think about

40:41.350 --> 40:45.617
that poor dog down
in the garage.

40:46.250 --> 40:49.584
And who knows
what you'll do.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.867
I know we only just met
each other, Mrs. Dubois...

41:00.350 --> 41:06.183
...but I think we both
know that your choice...

41:06.549 --> 41:10.883
(sighs)  won't be as easy as you
imagine it's going to be.

41:15.250 --> 41:17.749
Call it a hunch.

41:17.750 --> 41:19.649
An instinct.
