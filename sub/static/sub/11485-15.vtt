WEBVTT

00:02.852 --> 00:04.911
There we go. Watch your step.

00:04.988 --> 00:09.584
- I can't feel my face, Charlie.
- You just had two wisdom teeth pulled.

00:10.627 --> 00:12.254
Watch the drool.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.193
Look at that.

00:22.505 --> 00:28.068
- That is a very sexy woman.
- I'm sorry, that arouses you?

00:28.878 --> 00:30.505
- How you doing?
- Hey.

00:33.817 --> 00:35.614
Charlie, walk away.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.480
Relax. This could be interesting.

00:43.426 --> 00:45.018
You got a nice swing.

00:45.428 --> 00:46.520
Thanks.

00:48.698 --> 00:51.360
Try stepping in to it.
You will get more power that way.

00:51.434 --> 00:53.061
You mean like this?

00:56.339 --> 01:00.799
Yeah. Dial one and the area code,
because that is long-distance.

01:02.545 --> 01:05.513
Charlie, let's go,
this woman is clearly a lunatic.

01:05.915 --> 01:08.884
Yeah, but look at the passion, the fire,

01:09.953 --> 01:11.420
the ass.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.115
Is this your car?

01:17.460 --> 01:20.861
- Do I look crazy to you?
- Well, frankly...

01:26.603 --> 01:29.572
- So whose car is it? Cheating boyfriend?
- No.

01:29.973 --> 01:31.270
Psychiatrist.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.736
Charlie, psychiatrist.

01:35.812 --> 01:38.303
- What more do you need to hear?
- Hang on.

01:39.582 --> 01:43.609
- So, you are beating up your shrink's car?
- He said I have anger issues.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.353
The quack.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.830
- Then he hit on me.
- The horny quack.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.965
- Hold this for me.
- Good, I'm on deck.

02:06.309 --> 02:08.503
Man, this is going to take forever.

02:08.877 --> 02:11.312
Either one of you guys got an ice pick?

02:14.684 --> 02:17.847
Don't cars like this
usually have an alarm system?

02:19.189 --> 02:20.451
Thanks a lot.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.623
- Let's get out of here, Charlie.
- Hey!

02:24.327 --> 02:27.194
You are not just going
to leave me here, are you?

02:28.298 --> 02:29.595
Yes.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.761
- Alan.
- Charlie!

02:34.070 --> 02:36.402
So, how come Mush Mouth gets shotgun?

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.849 --> 02:49.945
Damn shrink. Anti-depressants,
tranquilizers, sleeping pills.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.221
- You want any of these?
- No, thanks.

02:52.288 --> 02:53.380
No, I'm good.

02:53.456 --> 02:56.118
Are you sure,
because you seem a little edgy?

02:56.226 --> 02:58.023
No, I'm a lot edgy.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.565
Isn't throwing that stuff
on the road a little dangerous?

03:06.703 --> 03:10.901
To who? Raccoons?
They can't get past the childproof cap.

03:14.043 --> 03:17.410
- I got to say, I really appreciate this, guys.
- No problem.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.047
Big problem.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.110
- Frankie.
- Charlie.

03:24.687 --> 03:27.679
- Awan.
- Awan?

03:28.091 --> 03:30.651
Not "Awan," Awan.

03:33.396 --> 03:35.557
Is Awan a little slow?

03:37.667 --> 03:39.225
Yeah.

03:40.403 --> 03:43.236
But I make up for it by being a little fast.

03:43.406 --> 03:45.306
- I know your type.
- You do?

03:45.408 --> 03:46.670
Yep.

03:46.776 --> 03:49.176
Don't care for it particularly.

03:51.014 --> 03:53.847
So, where can we drop you?

03:54.951 --> 03:57.852
That's the thing.
I really don't have anywhere to stay.

03:57.954 --> 04:00.980
Why? Did you escape from some place?

04:03.192 --> 04:06.093
Great. Pot shots from Spittle Boy.

04:07.964 --> 04:11.331
And if you must know,
I'm having family problems.

04:11.868 --> 04:16.362
Charlie, you wouldn't happen to know of
a place I could crash tonight, would you?

04:18.374 --> 04:20.000
Crap!

04:21.878 --> 04:23.903
Here we are. Chez Charlie.

04:24.647 --> 04:26.581
Great house!

04:27.250 --> 04:29.844
Oh, wow. You are right on the beach.

04:30.253 --> 04:33.017
I have got to go for a swim.

04:45.234 --> 04:47.429
- She's taking her clothes off.
- Yeah.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.596
Is this a great country or what?

04:50.740 --> 04:52.901
- Hi, Dad. Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- Hey, guys.

04:53.009 --> 04:55.034
Rose, what are you doing?

04:55.378 --> 04:59.508
- We are playing Mummy on a Chair.
- I'm the mummy.

05:03.286 --> 05:04.753
Judith, hi.

05:04.854 --> 05:08.881
- Is Jake ready to go?
- Hang on. Jake, your mom's here.

05:09.058 --> 05:13.188
Charlie, why don't you go out on the deck
and keep an eye out for

05:13.696 --> 05:15.527
approaching squalls?

05:16.699 --> 05:18.098
I'm on it.

05:20.636 --> 05:22.228
It's squall season.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.607
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

05:26.876 --> 05:30.573
- What is he doing?
- He's playing Mummy on a Chair.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.875
Where is the chair?

05:34.317 --> 05:36.717
I don't know the rules, Judith.

05:39.455 --> 05:41.423
Hi, Rose. Thanks for babysitting.

05:41.491 --> 05:43.823
- No problem. We had fun.
- Good.

05:44.127 --> 05:46.755
- So who's the naked lady?
- Not really sure.

05:46.829 --> 05:50.925
She was trashing a car with a baseball bat
when we left the dentist's office

05:51.000 --> 05:53.867
and, you know,
one thing kind of led to another.

05:53.936 --> 05:56.234
So you met cute, that's nice.

05:56.672 --> 06:00.506
But you know, you may want
to be careful with a girl like that, Charlie.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.805
One day it's baseball bats
and windshields,

06:02.879 --> 06:06.872
the next day you wake up with
your testicles Superglued to your thigh.

06:08.384 --> 06:12.480
- Point taken.
- I'm sorry about that, by the way.

06:14.724 --> 06:16.453
Water under the bridge.

06:19.062 --> 06:21.053
Hurry up, Jake. Your mother's waiting.

06:21.164 --> 06:24.725
Remember, I'm bringing him back
tomorrow night so I can see my parents.

06:24.834 --> 06:27.462
Why is there a woman's shoe
on your floor?

06:31.040 --> 06:35.374
Apparently, Mummy on a Chair
is a very complex game.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.209
- Bye, Dad.
- See you, pal.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.374
Tell your brother he is a pig.

06:42.351 --> 06:44.512
I will leave a note on the fridge.

06:45.254 --> 06:48.485
- God, I needed that.
- Me, too.

06:50.860 --> 06:54.352
It's like all my insanity and rage
have just been washed away.

06:54.430 --> 06:58.833
That's good. Because, you know,
all your drugs are on the Coast Highway.

07:00.069 --> 07:02.435
Where can I take a nice hot shower?

07:06.409 --> 07:08.377
I said where, not with whom.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.275
You guys are so cute.

07:16.385 --> 07:17.852
Right back at you.

07:18.387 --> 07:21.720
Good, Charlie.
Keep hitting on the deranged woman.

07:22.091 --> 07:25.720
While you are at it,
why don't you try humping a bear trap?

07:25.795 --> 07:28.889
Alan, open your eyes.
That is an intriguing and exciting woman.

07:28.965 --> 07:31.399
A rare and magnificent jewel.

07:31.601 --> 07:34.536
- She's hot and you are horny.
- I'm saying.

07:39.575 --> 07:43.739
- I just love warm sake.
- Me, too.

07:44.614 --> 07:46.206
<i>Tora, tora, tora!</i>

07:49.085 --> 07:52.782
You know, Frankie,
there are many fine hotels in the area.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.050
- I can't stay in a hotel.
- Why not?

07:56.592 --> 07:58.787
That is a very good question.

08:06.035 --> 08:08.333
So, where you from?

08:09.338 --> 08:10.532
Guess.

08:11.774 --> 08:14.368
- I wouldn't know where to begin.
- Okay.

08:20.716 --> 08:23.810
Here I am yakking about myself.
What about you guys?

08:23.886 --> 08:25.353
Alan, what do you do?

08:25.988 --> 08:27.546
Good question. Guess.

08:30.059 --> 08:31.356
How about that?

08:33.229 --> 08:35.958
- Alan, don't be childish.
- She started it.

08:38.701 --> 08:40.328
He is a chiropractor.

08:41.203 --> 08:42.330
Really?

08:43.239 --> 08:47.801
That's terrific. I have so much respect
for what you guys do.

08:49.178 --> 08:50.577
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

08:50.813 --> 08:53.043
Thank you. See that, Charlie?

08:53.549 --> 08:56.416
My brother thinks
I'm just a glorified masseuse.

08:57.486 --> 08:59.511
I never said glorified.

09:01.991 --> 09:04.289
Charlie, you are so wrong.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.659
Chiropractors are like angels of healing.

09:07.730 --> 09:12.531
These hands have amazing powers
to bring relief and even pleasure.

09:13.202 --> 09:15.500
Hey, these aren't exactly hooks.

09:19.208 --> 09:22.644
- Do you get regular chiropractic work?
- Are you kidding? Once a week.

09:22.712 --> 09:25.510
In fact, I'm in desperate need
of an adjustment right now.

09:25.581 --> 09:28.573
- Let me get my table, I will fix you up.
- Awesome.

09:28.684 --> 09:31.084
Do you want me with clothes or without?

09:51.807 --> 09:53.798
Are they looking for me?

09:55.444 --> 09:57.605
You didn't say anything, did you?

09:59.081 --> 10:02.642
I got to go. I love you.
I will see you soon. Come in.

10:04.253 --> 10:05.413
Hi.

10:06.989 --> 10:10.390
I was just going to go to bed and wanted
to see if you needed anything,

10:10.459 --> 10:12.051
towels, sheets,

10:13.562 --> 10:14.756
vodka?

10:16.299 --> 10:20.065
No, I'm great, thanks. Alan got me
totally jelled out with that adjustment.

10:20.136 --> 10:23.970
Man, you are so lucky
to have him right here in this house.

10:25.007 --> 10:27.100
Yeah, I'm living a dream.

10:30.579 --> 10:35.573
So, listen, if you need to talk to somebody
about, you know, anything, I'm here.

10:37.753 --> 10:39.152
I see that.

10:39.922 --> 10:41.321
Okay, then.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.591
Yeah.

10:46.796 --> 10:49.287
I think you are a really cool guy.

10:50.099 --> 10:51.430
Yeah.

10:52.668 --> 10:55.501
But I'm not going to have sex with you.

11:05.514 --> 11:09.610
- Ever?
- Good night, Charlie.

11:10.619 --> 11:11.881
Good night.

11:15.624 --> 11:19.082
Okay. Round one to the hot, crazy chick.

11:25.968 --> 11:29.165
Man, deep tissue massage, pancakes.

11:29.739 --> 11:34.472
If you had a TV on your forehead and could
breathe through the ears you'd be perfect.

11:41.817 --> 11:45.651
So nobody makes you pancakes
where you live?

11:46.989 --> 11:49.014
Not your husband,

11:51.193 --> 11:52.490
boyfriend,

11:54.730 --> 11:56.163
girlfriend,

11:58.167 --> 12:03.036
mother, father, grandma, cellmate?

12:11.680 --> 12:13.341
Round two.

12:16.719 --> 12:19.381
- Morning, Frankie.
- Morning, Charlie.

12:20.356 --> 12:22.688
- Morning.
- Yeah.

12:24.393 --> 12:27.590
So, Frankie. Boy, that is a pretty name.

12:29.098 --> 12:32.067
- How did you sleep?
- Great. Except,

12:32.935 --> 12:35.529
I had this wild erotic dream.

12:36.939 --> 12:39.908
And I woke up all drenched in sweat.

12:43.746 --> 12:47.705
- Could you pass the syrup?
- Sure. Yeah.

12:49.084 --> 12:51.552
Thanks, sweetie. You are a doll.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.795
You know, I can't thank you guys enough
for letting me stay here last night.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.263
I just wish there was some way
I could repay you.

13:03.332 --> 13:06.358
For a start, you could tell us
something about yourself.

13:06.469 --> 13:08.164
Anything, really.

13:08.304 --> 13:11.137
I wouldn't mind
hearing more about that dream.

13:12.975 --> 13:15.773
All right. I guess I can trust you guys.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.511
Charlie, Alan.

13:20.483 --> 13:23.145
I know this may sound totally crazy

13:24.320 --> 13:27.312
but I work for a secret
government agency,

13:28.290 --> 13:30.520
and my current mission is...

13:34.730 --> 13:38.461
I'm sorry. You should see your faces.
You guys are so easy.

13:40.536 --> 13:42.834
All right, I'm going to go take a bath.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.341
Who wants to scrub my back? Too late!

13:48.010 --> 13:50.376
Sometimes I just crack me up.

13:54.683 --> 13:57.675
So, what have you got going for today?

13:57.820 --> 14:00.220
Nothing. I was just going
to hang around the house.

14:00.322 --> 14:01.687
Yeah. Me, too.

14:02.725 --> 14:05.159
- No work? No errands?
- Not a thing.

14:05.995 --> 14:08.862
- Maybe you could see a movie.
- I've seen a movie.

14:10.499 --> 14:11.932
Come on, Alan.

14:12.034 --> 14:13.831
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

14:13.903 --> 14:16.497
Why don't you admit
that you are interested in Frankie?

14:16.572 --> 14:17.698
I'm not.

14:18.207 --> 14:20.607
- You are not?
- Honest to God.

14:22.044 --> 14:23.238
Fine.

14:24.246 --> 14:28.342
But hypothetically,
if I were interested in her,

14:29.151 --> 14:30.743
would you care?

14:30.819 --> 14:32.047
Of course I would.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.352
You are my brother. I don't want
to see you get your feelings hurt.

14:35.424 --> 14:38.689
You just assume that if we are both
interested in the same woman

14:38.761 --> 14:40.558
you would come out on top?

14:44.533 --> 14:48.469
- Aren't you going to say anything?
- What? There was no question there.

14:48.904 --> 14:53.807
- God, you are such an arrogant jerk.
- See, your feelings are hurt.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.539
My feelings are fine.

14:56.612 --> 15:01.072
I think the real issue here is Frankie
likes me better and it's driving you crazy.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.617
No.

15:02.718 --> 15:06.779
What's driving me crazy is that you
fought tooth and nail to keep the lunatic

15:06.889 --> 15:09.619
out of this house,
but now that she is here, you want her.

15:09.725 --> 15:10.885
I never said I wanted her.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.428
But you think that if you did want her,

15:13.495 --> 15:15.793
you could have her
even if I wanted her, too.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.163
- Aren't you going to say something?
- There was no question there.

15:24.139 --> 15:25.367
Okay. Fine.

15:25.441 --> 15:27.773
Take your best shot.
Let me just give you a little heads up.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.971
- I am way out in front.
- Yeah? How do you figure?

15:31.180 --> 15:34.081
Frankie and I have already discussed
having sex.

15:47.429 --> 15:49.192
What are you doing?

15:49.598 --> 15:51.998
I just thought Frankie
might like some fresh towels.

15:52.101 --> 15:54.160
I already gave her fresh towels.

15:56.005 --> 15:57.165
Really?

15:57.539 --> 16:01.031
Well, aren't you Toweley Towellerson
all of a sudden.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.712
- You know, Alan, it's not my fault.
- What's not your fault?

16:06.815 --> 16:09.648
That I've always been more successful
with women than you.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.710
Have been, Charlie. Have been.
We are not teenagers anymore.

16:12.821 --> 16:15.813
Your bad-boy act
just might be wearing just a little thin.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.985
- Or you just might be a little jealous.
- Jealous?

16:21.296 --> 16:22.763
Don't... me.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.101
When the occasion calls for...
I have every right to...

16:34.910 --> 16:37.504
What? I thought we were
doing funny noises.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.007
That was an elephant.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.515
- Yeah, elephant.
- It was good. Yeah. Really good.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.077
I'm ready to go.
Can one of you guys give me a ride?

16:47.189 --> 16:48.247
- Absolutely.
- Sure.

16:48.357 --> 16:50.348
- Great. Who's driving?
- I will.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.451
- I got the Jag.
- I got the Volvo.

16:53.562 --> 16:55.029
- Mine's faster.
- Mine's safer.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.533
- Alan, stop competing with me.
- Why don't you stop competing with me?

16:58.600 --> 17:01.194
- Why should I stop? I'm winning.
- Like hell you are.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.034
- Like hell I am. Ask Frankie.
- Why don't you ask Frankie?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.438
- I don't need to ask her.
- What are you afraid of?

17:06.541 --> 17:09.602
I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard
I'll be an only child.

17:09.712 --> 17:11.703
Yeah? Bring it on.

17:11.814 --> 17:13.906
Hey! Stop it!

17:13.982 --> 17:17.473
What is wrong with you two?
You are family. You are brothers.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.452
Do you understand how precious that is?

17:20.556 --> 17:24.048
Do you have a clue the pain you feel
when a family rips itself apart

17:24.126 --> 17:25.888
and there is no one to replace them?

17:25.961 --> 17:30.159
I mean, that's it, you know,
you are all alone in the world and...

17:31.500 --> 17:33.229
It's just so horrible.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.839
- It's okay.
- Yeah, look, we are not fighting.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.235
Yeah. We love each other. See?

17:44.346 --> 17:48.180
Yeah, and it doesn't matter who drives,
you know. We will both come.

17:49.284 --> 17:51.115
Good. Let's go.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.290
- Nice house.
- Yeah.

17:59.361 --> 18:02.194
All right, I've just got to pick up
a few things and then,

18:02.264 --> 18:04.755
I was hoping you could take me
to the train station.

18:04.833 --> 18:09.133
- The train station? Where are you going?
- I don't know. I will figure something out.

18:09.204 --> 18:12.970
If it helps any, you are welcome to stay
with us for a couple more days.

18:13.041 --> 18:15.532
- I couldn't impose.
- It's no imposition.

18:15.644 --> 18:17.942
- Yeah. We like having you.
- Are you sure?

18:18.013 --> 18:20.004
It's settled. You are staying with us.

18:20.115 --> 18:22.709
Man, how much do I love you guys.

18:23.652 --> 18:25.142
I'll be right back.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.185
- What a nice girl.
- Yeah.

18:33.262 --> 18:35.560
Of course, we still don't know
a damn thing about her.

18:35.631 --> 18:39.567
True. Although that is one big-ass house
she lives in.

18:40.302 --> 18:42.133
Or is robbing.

18:44.239 --> 18:47.003
That would make us
the duped getaway drivers.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.471
Moron accessories to grand theft.

18:51.847 --> 18:54.042
That's a major felony.

18:54.683 --> 18:56.742
Yeah. Hard time.

19:04.026 --> 19:08.258
I can't do hard time, Charlie.
I have allergies.

19:10.165 --> 19:12.656
That's going to be your biggest problem.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.004
Watch your head, sweetheart.

19:18.373 --> 19:21.001
Hi.

19:21.610 --> 19:22.975
I'm Joanie.

19:23.712 --> 19:26.943
- Hi.
- Okay. We can go now.

19:27.783 --> 19:29.250
Where are we going, Mommy?

19:29.318 --> 19:31.912
We are going to go
to Charlie and Alan's house, hon.

19:31.987 --> 19:35.787
It's a wonderful place where
those awful people will never find us.

19:36.825 --> 19:38.918
You were right.

19:39.061 --> 19:41.086
We should have taken the Volvo.

19:44.399 --> 19:47.459
<i>Stay tuned for scenes
from the next Two and a Half Men.</i>

19:48.937 --> 19:50.302
<i>Next on Two and a Half Men.</i>

19:50.405 --> 19:52.066
Are you guys gay?

19:52.941 --> 19:55.136
- Unfit, how?
- You know...

19:55.911 --> 19:57.606
We got to get them out of here.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.078
You can take your damn money

19:59.147 --> 20:01.672
and stick it up
your "white bread, country club,

20:01.750 --> 20:04.412
"Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass.

20:04.753 --> 20:06.880
I just met your brother's latest stuff.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.583
- Why do you assume it's his stuff?
- What? Is it yours?

20:09.658 --> 20:11.148
No, but it's not his, either.

20:11.260 --> 20:13.728
Hold on there, Pecos Bill.

20:14.062 --> 20:17.623
No, I like girls.
Just not into eight-year-olds.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.494
The bad news is
that wasn't my shrink's car.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.798
It's been so long
since anybody's touched me.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.410
Come on. Don't you want to spoon?

20:32.281 --> 20:34.112
Coffee?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.314
I'm the extra guy.

20:39.988 --> 20:43.151
I'm wrapped
tighter than an airport sandwich.

20:43.592 --> 20:45.287
Here, I'm running late.

20:46.695 --> 20:48.856
You're going to get laid tonight.

20:48.964 --> 20:51.660
Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls?

21:21.763 --> 21:22.957
English
