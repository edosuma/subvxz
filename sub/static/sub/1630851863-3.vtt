PREVIOUSLY ON MYTHO

00:09.840 --> 00:10.680
Hi!

00:10.760 --> 00:12.280
Too bad Mom's not here.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.800
Don't mention her.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.680
Christmas is coming up.

00:15.760 --> 00:16.640
Christmas.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.800
Patrick has moved on.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.960
Try "Elvira Giannini."

00:21.040 --> 00:23.040
Is it your wife's card?

00:23.120 --> 00:24.040
Ex-wife.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.200
You want some advice?

00:25.280 --> 00:26.880
Don't call her.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.080
Ready?

00:28.160 --> 00:29.120
Yeah, let's go.

00:30.040 --> 00:30.880
Go? Where?

00:31.640 --> 00:32.880
Is it any of your business?

00:34.440 --> 00:36.200
You know the aluminum factory?

00:36.280 --> 00:38.440
If you get them to renew their contract,

00:38.520 --> 00:40.960
I'll be able to hire you back.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.840
Thanks for taking care of me.
Thank God you're here.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.240
Lorenzo!

00:46.320 --> 00:47.840
-He's my cousin.
-So?

00:48.480 --> 00:49.520
My mother's back.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.320
She had the name
of her first boyfriend tattooed.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.600
Funny, his name was Lorenzo too.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.040
Mama?

00:58.840 --> 01:00.480
It feels weird, saying it.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.520
Your mom wants us all together
for Christmas.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.960
Tails, we invite her.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.640
Heads, we don't.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.480
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:21.760 --> 01:27.080
The Priestess. Calm, precise,
biding her time to fulfill her goals.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.960
The Hermit. He's cut himself off
from the outside world.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.520
The Tower. Fall and redemption.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.480
<i>A time of reconciliation.</i>

01:41.560 --> 01:43.080
All right, don't oversell it.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.360
You can't do that.

01:44.440 --> 01:50.280
Sorry but it sounds like "the Priestess"
sent you over to bullshit me.

01:52.480 --> 01:57.120
Fine. Elvira asked me to prep you
so that dinner goes well.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.360
I knew it.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
You're so childish.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.400
Give me a drag of that.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.120
Interesting.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.080
Take it easy.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.160
I had no intention of seeing Elvira

02:26.000 --> 02:28.920
but Fate made that call for me.
I've accepted it

02:29.000 --> 02:33.200
but don't expect me to welcome her
with open arms.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.200
What are you afraid of?

02:36.560 --> 02:39.760
Draw a card,
I'll tell you what you're afraid of.

02:43.120 --> 02:43.960
There you go.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.480
What the fuck?

02:45.560 --> 02:47.720
I knew it. The Erynies.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.560
The Erynies?

02:49.640 --> 02:53.440
They have many names: Furies, bats.
They are entities of remorse.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.280
They haunt ungiving souls.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.560
The Priestess and the Hermit
will have to face them. Together.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.560
You must accept spending Christmas
with Elvira.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.680
<i>Open the door</i>
<i>to the mother of your children</i>

03:12.760 --> 03:16.560
and your heart will soar in harmony
with your decision.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.240
This Furies thing is freaking me out.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.800
I bet they're horribly mean,
with small gnarly teeth.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.240
Absolutely.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.520
I don't feel too good.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.440
I'm going to lie down.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.040
-Isa?
<i>-It worked, just like I planned.</i>

04:03.600 --> 04:07.000
He asked to smoke the pipe
and then went right to sleep.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.480
Herb of Venus always works.
As an aphrodisiac, too.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.080
<i>You'll get a queen's welcome.</i>

04:13.160 --> 04:14.720
Thanks, so much.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.840
Make sure to look good
and it'll all be fine.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.240
Thanks.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.560
Keep going.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.360
Thanks.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.400
Thanks.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.120
This is for Dad. For Mom. Carole and Sam.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.320
We always make the presents ourselves.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.240
That's a good idea.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.120
You must be happy to have your mother.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.800
I guess. I'm afraid they'll fight.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.520
Maybe you could come?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.800
Like a go-between.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.760
I don't think that's a good idea.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.560
I'm needed here.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.640
You don't celebrate Christmas.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.800
We don't. But...

05:24.880 --> 05:30.560
We do celebrate, and think of those
who are alone and suffering that night.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.440
Someone to see you.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.440
Thank you very much.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.680
How much for the books?

05:48.760 --> 05:51.560
How about we discuss that
once you've read them?

05:52.440 --> 05:54.320
Will you please serve our guests?

05:54.400 --> 05:55.360
Of course.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.280
She's cute.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.360
Your daughter?

06:00.440 --> 06:01.320
No.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.480
She's not my daughter.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.920
We help kids from the community
with schoolwork.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.760
Virginie's here as a neighbor,
to read our young adult books.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.200
I've read everything about Awakening.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.440
I could explain it to you.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.800
It's an interest of yours?

06:18.880 --> 06:20.000
A major interest.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.840
I'm too young to attend gatherings
but I know what goes on there.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.240
I know how to reach the bridge
to purification.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.840
Virginie, please fetch my glasses
from my office.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.880
Sure.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.320
Would you like something to eat?

06:39.280 --> 06:40.160
Edouard?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.520
I didn't find them.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.600
You just had to show off!

06:51.400 --> 06:53.680
Sorry, I thought...

06:53.760 --> 06:55.120
Think only what I tell you.

06:55.200 --> 07:01.240
Don't talk about things you don't know
to strangers. They could harm us.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.280
Do you really think so?

07:04.360 --> 07:08.520
I know it when people are in pain,
and in need of help. They're not.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.640
Why are they here?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.160
That's for us to find out.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.480
Now, shut up. Got it?

07:18.400 --> 07:21.680
They thought you were my daughter.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.920
How did you do it?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
That guy wouldn't listen to anything.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.840
-I tinkered with the contract a little.
-How?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.560
I added a clause giving him two more years

07:37.640 --> 07:39.560
to get everything up to safety standards.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.600
You think it'll fly with HQ?

07:42.400 --> 07:43.640
-It has to.
-Careful!

07:46.240 --> 07:47.280
Thank you.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.920
All right. Was it Brunet's idea?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.160
Maxence? Yes. He helped.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.400
Now you're on a first name basis
with that jerk Brunet?

07:59.800 --> 08:00.800
Holy shit.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.360
I have a bad feeling about him.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.640
He's actually charming.

08:05.760 --> 08:10.040
So was Charles Manson. Evil fuckers
always are, that's how they get you.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.640
Wake up, Elvira. That dude's...

08:13.400 --> 08:14.520
the Devil.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.640
I know. There's an envelope for you
in my bag.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.920
Between the diapers.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.720
There's a Christmas bonus.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.440
Thanks.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.280
What does he want?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.200
How did you know I was here?

08:54.640 --> 08:55.560
You're following me?

08:56.080 --> 08:57.000
Yes.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.480
I wanted to see you.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.520
How about a movie?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.520
I don't have much time.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.600
Come on.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.720
Hi, Patrick.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.360
Is this a bad time?

09:44.560 --> 09:47.680
You're not answering my texts,
I got worried.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.920
Is there something in my hair?

09:55.840 --> 09:58.280
It's... silky.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.760
You have great hair texture.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.120
Not really.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.120
Yeah, you do.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.440
Gorgeous skin.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.600
In the bedroom?

10:23.680 --> 10:24.640
It's my room.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.400
It's nice, catching a movie together.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.400
It is.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.040
What's the movie about?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.000
No idea.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.520
I just liked the title.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.560
Want some?

11:15.160 --> 11:16.080
No, thanks.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.480
You said we're cousins through your uncle.
He says it's through your mom.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.400
Listen here.

11:33.680 --> 11:38.360
My mother had four children. Me,

11:38.920 --> 11:44.360
with her first husband, my dad.
He died during the war. So my mother...

11:45.320 --> 11:46.480
You're confusing me.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.400
Are we real cousins?

11:49.000 --> 11:49.920
Or sort of cousins?

11:50.000 --> 11:54.240
In our village, we're all cousins.
We marry each other.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.200
Got it.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.920
You're not in love with him, are you?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.760
No! Are you crazy?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.960
Good.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.280
You know, everyone will be there
for Christmas tomorrow.

12:10.840 --> 12:11.680
Yes, everyone.

12:14.280 --> 12:15.440
Karina will be with you?

12:15.520 --> 12:19.240
Karina? She's with her mother who's sick.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.880
Then she'll be back here with me,
as soon as possible.

12:23.960 --> 12:24.800
That's cool.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.640
I like Karina.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.520
So do I.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.960
What got into me?

12:37.560 --> 12:39.000
I wasn't myself.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.680
I never should have slept with her.
In my house, no less.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.400
This is all Isa's fault.
She's really weird.

12:47.480 --> 12:51.640
With her cards and trinkets.
She's super freaky.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.160
Tell me about it.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.200
But I love that about her.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.480
You never worried she'd hide
weird stuff in your pillow?

12:59.560 --> 13:03.320
Sure. Once, I found seven apple pips
in my sock.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.960
She tried to put a spell on you.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.440
No.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.960
So I'd give her more space.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.680
Not cool.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.960
Hand me the tape.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.760
But...

13:16.840 --> 13:18.000
You know...

13:18.920 --> 13:22.360
When Isa told me she didn't admire me,

13:22.920 --> 13:25.000
at first, I thought it was so mean.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.760
But then I thought about it.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.840
Give it here.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.400
I figured...

13:32.160 --> 13:34.080
I should find something

13:34.960 --> 13:39.120
to amaze her. So she'd go:
"He's actually a great guy!"

13:40.080 --> 13:42.400
I had an idea.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.360
Here.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.440
What's the idea?

13:47.840 --> 13:48.880
Well...

13:49.600 --> 13:52.000
I'll start a delivery service.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.520
Vegetarian hot dogs, home delivered.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.760
Great.

13:58.800 --> 14:03.040
But... vegetarian hot dogs?
What's in the bun, then?

14:04.080 --> 14:06.000
Tofu sausages.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.000
What?

14:08.520 --> 14:09.400
Tofu.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.800
Tofu? Is that good?

14:11.880 --> 14:13.400
No, it's gross.

14:13.480 --> 14:17.920
It's super healthy though.
It actually unclogs arteries.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.400
Promise you won't take my answer
the wrong way.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.760
Absolutely, I'm eager to hear it.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.040
Well...

14:28.560 --> 14:30.560
You're looking to impress a girl.

14:31.760 --> 14:37.040
I'm not sure tofu dogs are the key
to make her go, "Please marry me!"

14:38.880 --> 14:40.200
I'm just looking out for you.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.880
Let's take a break. I must have
some vodka hidden somewhere around here.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.560
<i>Before she took the train,</i>

14:51.240 --> 14:54.680
<i>we hugged goodbye and promised</i>
<i>each other to keep in touch.</i>

14:56.280 --> 14:58.000
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

15:32.120 --> 15:33.680
-That was beautiful.
-Yeah.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.440
Let's see another one.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.080
I wish I could, but I'm so busy.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.360
Doing what? Getting me a present?

15:48.120 --> 15:51.440
They invited me for Christmas too,
you know.

15:52.080 --> 15:52.920
Did they?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.360
I'm family.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.000
You don't look happy.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.440
Will you go?

16:01.360 --> 16:04.720
I haven't decided yet.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.920
My fiancée's waiting for me in Italy.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.560
If I ever marry her, you'll meet her.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.400
Come on.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.600
You pick the movie.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.080
I'll get some candy.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.680
So?

16:40.640 --> 16:43.160
A bombshell. He'll never resist you.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.360
-He'll be here tonight?
-No idea.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.080
He never answered?

16:47.840 --> 16:48.720
No.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.080
Maybe he's back in Italy.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.000
Shut up.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.960
He should be here for Christmas.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.960
I need to get him something.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.720
You're his Christmas present.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.200
Can I hang at your place tomorrow?

17:00.280 --> 17:02.120
My dad's leaving with his girlfriend.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.320
Of course you can.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.320
Your dad's away for Christmas?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.160
What a jerk.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.640
This one's great.

17:10.599 --> 17:11.440
You think?

17:13.040 --> 17:14.319
Totally.

17:14.920 --> 17:15.760
Gorgeous.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.359
Please knock first!

17:25.800 --> 17:26.839
Are those the gifts?

17:27.440 --> 17:28.359
Yes.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.640
You've done the T-shirt thing.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.280
In a different color.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.200
I made some for Nonno and Lorenzo too.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.920
And for Mom?

17:38.760 --> 17:39.680
Obviously.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.040
You think Mom and Dad
will get back together?

17:48.120 --> 17:50.320
No. It's over and done with.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.480
Don't you care?

17:53.840 --> 17:54.960
It's their business.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.440
Do you care about Renan dating Louise?

18:03.920 --> 18:05.320
What?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.120
They're not even hiding it.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.720
They used to date.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.120
They're close, but not together.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.840
You don't believe me? I saw them.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.520
Check out her page yourself.
She keeps posting stuff.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.960
Now get out, you're a pain.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.000
Well...

18:54.080 --> 18:55.640
Are you spying on us?

18:56.480 --> 18:57.600
A bit sad, no?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.440
Give me a break.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.280
I wanted to surprise you.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.600
No, you're stalking me.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.120
You're freaking me out, actually.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.440
Does she know we have sex?

19:10.520 --> 19:12.920
We had sex once.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.520
We're not married.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.160
What's up with you?

19:17.080 --> 19:18.360
I think he's jealous.

19:23.960 --> 19:24.920
You don't mind?

19:25.000 --> 19:25.880
No.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.720
As long as it's not with a girl.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.600
It's kinda hot.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.880
Why did you lie?

19:34.960 --> 19:38.360
I never lied. You believed
what you wanted to believe.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.440
That's it.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.760
Sorry about it.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.240
I think Sam has issues with lying.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.960
Lorenzo, it's Carole.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.280
Please call to let me know you're okay.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.480
I'm hanging out with friends,
please drop by.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.720
I'll send you the address.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.520
A séance, really?

20:11.720 --> 20:13.160
Kevin's so into it.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.760
Hi.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.240
How's it going?

20:22.680 --> 20:25.240
-Hi.
-How are you doing?

20:25.720 --> 20:27.200
Hi.

20:41.320 --> 20:45.800
It was beautiful, right? In this moment...

20:47.080 --> 20:48.080
Very much.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.880
The movies were fun.

20:53.000 --> 20:53.960
I...

20:55.080 --> 20:56.520
Hanging with you was fun.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.360
Check this out.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.080
Italian style.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.160
The French drive like losers, you know.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.120
Be careful.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.600
Yes.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.440
What now?

21:24.840 --> 21:27.600
Well, I don't know.

21:30.960 --> 21:31.920
How about a game?

21:34.720 --> 21:36.800
Let's ask each other questions.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.240
What kind?

21:38.320 --> 21:41.840
For instance... What's my favorite color?

21:46.280 --> 21:47.720
What's your favorite color?

21:50.680 --> 21:52.120
That's too easy.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.680
You ask me something then.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.480
Me?

21:59.560 --> 22:00.400
Yes.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.520
Ready?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.720
Why did you abandon me?

22:07.600 --> 22:08.920
Next question.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.480
Did you ever think about me?

22:14.920 --> 22:16.920
Maybe, around Christmas?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.640
Did you ever wonder,

22:22.240 --> 22:23.240
"What's he doing?"

22:24.120 --> 22:26.280
"Is he sad? Unhappy?"

22:28.640 --> 22:29.480
No.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.240
I don't believe you!

22:39.040 --> 22:40.280
Say something!

22:41.640 --> 22:42.880
I don't believe you.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.160
Thinking about you hurt too much.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.800
So, I erased you.

22:58.440 --> 22:59.840
Wait! Stop it.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.720
You didn't erase me.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.520
You didn't erase me!

23:26.360 --> 23:27.960
Why did you leave me?

23:30.560 --> 23:31.840
Tell me.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.000
Why did you abandon me?

23:41.240 --> 23:42.520
All right.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.360
It begins...

23:54.000 --> 23:58.400
it was during the summer,
I was 15 years old.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.000
<i>My dad had sent me away to his mother's.</i>

24:03.480 --> 24:04.360
<i>In Italy.</i>

24:05.120 --> 24:07.160
We're going to hang out with some friends.

24:07.240 --> 24:11.760
<i>While my parents were going</i>
<i>on a long trip.</i>

24:14.160 --> 24:16.960
In fact, they had stayed in Nice.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.960
My mother was sick.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.600
Breast cancer.

24:29.240 --> 24:32.200
My parents hadn't told me anything.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.480
I didn't know what I was doing.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.280
<i>I used to hang out with a group.</i>

24:43.000 --> 24:46.880
<i>Young people a lot older than me,</i>
<i>borderline delinquents.</i>

24:49.200 --> 24:53.200
<i>They had found an empty villa</i>
<i>that they occupied.</i>

25:05.920 --> 25:07.280
In the group...

25:08.880 --> 25:10.680
there was a guy.

25:13.480 --> 25:14.480
Filippo.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.520
Are you French?

25:23.960 --> 25:26.800
Yes. But my dad is Italian.

25:29.040 --> 25:29.920
From where?

25:30.560 --> 25:31.400
Nice.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.240
Really...

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
<i>He was...</i>

25:45.160 --> 25:48.040
<i>the most beautiful boy</i>
<i>I had ever seen on earth.</i>

25:48.120 --> 25:49.040
You want a beer?

25:49.640 --> 25:50.480
Okay.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.440
<i>You can't imagine...</i>

25:56.280 --> 25:58.160
how beautiful he was.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.720
To die for.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.800
I fell madly in love with him.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.160
Go on.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.840
<i>Filippo was my first love.</i>

27:20.000 --> 27:21.440
My first lover.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.720
My mother died two days later.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.400
And my dad didn't tell me anything.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.960
I found out weeks...

27:35.520 --> 27:36.520
later.

27:39.360 --> 27:43.440
I also discovered much later
that I was pregnant.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.040
It was too late to have an abortion.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.840
My father...

27:59.960 --> 28:01.280
you didn't tell him anything.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.680
You didn't try to see him again?

28:05.920 --> 28:07.960
Yes, but...

28:15.480 --> 28:16.760
He was in an accident.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.720
-What kind?
-I don't know.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.440
He died young.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.600
That's all I know.

28:32.680 --> 28:36.880
When Nonno found out,
he forbade me to see those friends.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.440
And me?

28:46.040 --> 28:47.360
What happened to me?

28:49.240 --> 28:50.200
You?

28:51.640 --> 28:53.840
I was too young to take care of you.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.480
We kept you a secret

28:57.560 --> 29:00.520
and my grandma found you
a foster family in Italy.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.360
Why did you change your name?

29:10.760 --> 29:12.360
I didn't want to be found.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.000
What was my dad's last name?

29:18.280 --> 29:19.440
Mezzanotte.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.320
Filippo Mezzanotte.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.120
Are you lying to me?

29:34.680 --> 29:35.600
No.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.600
Get out.

29:44.680 --> 29:45.760
Get lost!

30:07.120 --> 30:08.640
We'll finish tomorrow. I'm tired.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.320
What should I do with this?

30:11.400 --> 30:12.280
In the trash.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.040
What a waste.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.480
I said trash. All of this, in the trash.

30:17.560 --> 30:21.440
Elvira, straight in the bin too.
All of it.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.320
Why are you so hard on her?

30:25.400 --> 30:26.400
I don't get it.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.840
Have you tried putting yourself
in her shoes?

30:29.920 --> 30:31.760
-She went through so much.
-What?

30:32.320 --> 30:35.120
And who's thinking
about what I went through?

30:36.320 --> 30:38.880
We all have been, for months.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.960
-What?
-That's right. The kids, me, Nonno.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.680
Sandrine. Even Isa.
Yes, we've all thought about you.

30:48.760 --> 30:49.880
Oh, I'm sorry!

30:49.960 --> 30:53.480
Forgive me for having my life
fucked up overnight!

30:53.560 --> 30:55.360
-And what a good life it was.
-Yes.

30:55.440 --> 30:59.280
Great kids, amazing wife.
You seem to have forgotten all that.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.880
You weren't the perfect husband,
by the way.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.640
What the hell?

31:04.200 --> 31:05.680
You're a perfect prick.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.600
You're the most selfish person
I've ever met!

31:32.760 --> 31:34.680
Fuck you and your tofu!

31:59.440 --> 32:02.840
<i>You, evil spirit, who has freed yourself</i>
<i>from your chains.</i>

32:05.440 --> 32:06.480
Thank you.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.600
<i>Forsaken soul who has escaped your abode.</i>

32:11.800 --> 32:14.640
<i>You are back to torment us tonight.</i>

32:17.880 --> 32:20.760
<i>Be gone, and make room for the spirits</i>
<i>we call upon.</i>

32:22.160 --> 32:24.280
<i>Let them give us a sign.</i>

32:25.680 --> 32:29.120
<i>You, sought-after spirit,</i>

32:29.720 --> 32:32.680
<i>prove to us that you are here.</i>

32:33.840 --> 32:35.000
Spirit, are you there?

32:42.080 --> 32:43.680
This is not working.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.200
Don't be such a pain.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.720
You, heavenly creature,

32:49.600 --> 32:53.120
let us at last acknowledge them,
as they should be.

32:58.880 --> 32:59.720
You found us.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.320
I'm going home.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.480
Me too.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.200
Come see.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.800
There was a murder here a few months back.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.520
Some lady killed her husband.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.040
An old lady.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.160
She wore pink.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.280
No one dares come here.

33:27.880 --> 33:28.880
Except us.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.960
Why won't you answer my texts?

33:39.560 --> 33:40.560
You're seeing someone?

33:41.200 --> 33:42.080
No.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.160
Don't.

33:50.920 --> 33:51.880
Stop.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.120
I know you want to.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.520
Leave me alone.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.880
You hear me?

35:24.800 --> 35:27.920
<i>Today's the day, the day before Christmas!</i>

35:28.000 --> 35:30.600
Happy hearts, happy homes!

35:30.680 --> 35:33.600
Only a few hours to go!

35:33.680 --> 35:37.760
And only a few hours left
to enjoy our special sale!

35:38.640 --> 35:42.920
I can't bear to look at her.
I'm afraid I'll have a panic attack.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.240
Then don't go.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.000
Virginie will be so mad if I don't.

35:47.640 --> 35:48.600
Cancel it.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.160
-Cancel Christmas?
-I'm looking for gluten-free toast.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.080
In the organic aisle.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.120
How about "thank you"?

35:58.200 --> 36:00.200
I have two tickets to a Marivaux play.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.360
Boys' night out?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.720
I can't.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.920
Fuck, I feel like I should do it.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.720
But can I handle the whole thing?

36:07.800 --> 36:11.000
I mentioned you to one of the hostesses.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.720
Ask her to come tonight.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.120
Show Elvira you're moving on.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.760
I tried that. I slept with a friend.

36:18.840 --> 36:22.840
Big mistake.
I'm not ready for another woman.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.360
It's like I can't get over her.

36:25.440 --> 36:26.960
I'm stuck on her.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.760
I can't find my toast.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.720
Then eat some fucking gluten,
who gives a shit?

36:31.800 --> 36:33.840
You can't stay in a rut,

36:33.920 --> 36:35.360
you have to move on!

36:35.440 --> 36:36.480
Yeah, but...

36:36.560 --> 36:38.120
She's always on my mind.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.520
You idiot! Move on!

36:40.600 --> 36:43.440
Don't you think she has?

36:49.080 --> 36:51.360
You're right. You're right.

36:52.520 --> 36:53.360
Thanks.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.520
Thanks for telling it like it is.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.280
Thanks, buddy.

37:00.760 --> 37:06.080
By the way, do you have any free food?
Some expired dips and shit?

37:06.160 --> 37:08.200
No, they've emptied the stock.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.560
Merry Christmas, then.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.440
Come in.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.640
I can't manage.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.080
I can't do it.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.280
I haven't been able to tell my family

37:47.840 --> 37:51.640
that Karina had left me and
there wouldn't be a Christmas dinner.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.600
What should I do?

37:57.080 --> 38:00.400
I wasn't able to tell my daughter
that her mother died.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.240
I couldn't tell my grandchildren that

38:04.320 --> 38:08.080
their cousin was their brother and so...

38:08.160 --> 38:10.520
I can't do it. I'm incapable...

38:10.600 --> 38:14.760
It gets stuck right here.
Everything I have to say. Right here.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.960
It's my fault. My fault.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.920
I've been a terrible example
for my family.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.760
You think of yourself as important.

38:29.720 --> 38:30.840
In what sense?

38:32.440 --> 38:33.880
Think about it for next week.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.600
Now you're pissing me off.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.240
You see, you are useless.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.560
No, you've made a lot of progress.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.040
Karina wanted me to do this.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.160
So, I am seeing you.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.080
But Karina still left.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.640
This is pointless.

38:53.720 --> 38:56.640
Well. See you next Wednesday.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.440
You'll tell me about Christmas.

38:58.520 --> 39:01.160
Why are you so interested
in the lives of others?

39:02.360 --> 39:05.560
Well, I won't tell you anything. Okay?
Fuck this.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.960
SAM AND RENAN IN LOVE!?!

39:23.040 --> 39:24.920
GO GET BLOWN IN HELL

40:10.320 --> 40:12.280
Nonno called, he's not coming.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.040
Shit.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.240
Did you find anything at the supermarket?

40:17.320 --> 40:19.920
Nothing, I was counting on Nonno.

40:20.000 --> 40:20.880
Hi, Dad!

40:22.400 --> 40:23.280
Hi.

40:23.360 --> 40:26.080
I'm so happy
we're spending Christmas together.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.520
Need any help making dinner?

40:29.120 --> 40:30.200
Sure.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.240
Cool.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.160
What did you buy?

40:46.720 --> 40:48.080
You need the bathroom?

40:48.600 --> 40:49.800
I'll only be a second.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.400
Who mangled your hair like this?

40:52.480 --> 40:53.640
You don't like it?

40:54.640 --> 40:55.880
It's good for a Spaniel.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.760
Maxence, what's going on?
Are you in a bad mood?

41:03.240 --> 41:04.080
There's this.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.000
There you go!

41:08.720 --> 41:10.080
Two cans of pineapple.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.880
Let's make a pineapple Yule log.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.680
Do we have eggs?

41:15.680 --> 41:16.680
No.

41:17.680 --> 41:18.600
Fuck me.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.640
I'll get it.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.480
She's here already?

41:25.920 --> 41:26.840
Good evening.

41:27.720 --> 41:28.600
Hi.

41:28.680 --> 41:29.520
Is Samuel home?

41:30.000 --> 41:30.840
Sam!

41:32.560 --> 41:33.440
Hi.

41:33.960 --> 41:34.800
Hello.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.320
You know why we're here?

41:50.680 --> 41:52.280
I'm off.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.400
Would you like to come too?

41:57.480 --> 41:58.600
Of course.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.720
You're as dumb as ever.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.800
What? No, I just...

42:03.880 --> 42:05.280
You're happy,

42:05.360 --> 42:06.600
you're going to see "him".

42:08.200 --> 42:09.840
Gee whiz.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.720
He makes your heart sing.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.560
It's revolting. What a hypocrite.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.440
All that, just to fit in.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.200
To be just like your neighbors.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.160
Well, fuck that!

42:20.800 --> 42:22.520
Fuck your going back to your ex.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.680
I don't understand.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.520
You don't? Elvira!

42:27.800 --> 42:29.440
Are you a complete moron?

42:30.760 --> 42:34.400
I'm in love with you, Elvira.

42:34.480 --> 42:37.480
Ever since you walked into my office,
with your crazy outfit

42:38.120 --> 42:42.120
and your amazing pear-shaped ass.
And I love pears.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.160
I've studied your breasts a lot.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.720
I believe they are magnificent.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.120
I'm madly in love with you!
It's pretty obvious.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.520
I want to wake up next to you,

42:56.360 --> 42:59.080
to watch you eat toast,
even if you dip it in your tea.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.800
I love your perfume.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.520
I want to marry you, have kids. But now...

43:05.120 --> 43:06.600
I'm afraid of one thing.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.600
Afraid you'll tell me that...

43:13.960 --> 43:15.320
the evening was a success.

43:16.040 --> 43:20.520
That your husband
has agreed to go on a journey with you.

43:36.720 --> 43:37.800
Maxence!

43:45.640 --> 43:46.680
Maxence!

43:50.600 --> 43:52.000
Maxence!

44:34.320 --> 44:36.800
