00:10.793 --> 00:12.055
- Twenty years ago,

00:12.099 --> 00:14.144
this neighborhood
was all deep-dish.

00:14.188 --> 00:17.669
Now it's flatbread
and kabobs.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.671
- Things change.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.021
- Yeah, I hear you.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.587
- Welcome, brothers.

00:22.631 --> 00:23.588
- That's Akeem.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.155
- Welcome.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.854
America is not
the land of freedom.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.988
It is the land of inequality.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.731
Minorities don't wear chains,

00:35.774 --> 00:37.515
but they are still slaves

00:37.559 --> 00:40.997
to a system
that serves the rich.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.348
The shiny toys of capitalism

00:44.392 --> 00:46.481
mean nothing to Allah.

00:46.524 --> 00:51.094
This is why Islam
is such a threat to America.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.401
What they want,
what they live for,

00:53.444 --> 00:57.535
can only be accomplished
by our elimination.

00:57.579 --> 01:01.365
So that the wheels of greed
and capitalism

01:01.409 --> 01:03.367
can continue to turn.

01:03.411 --> 01:06.109
Only through Allah
will we deliver

01:06.153 --> 01:07.980
the equity
and the sovereignty.

01:08.024 --> 01:12.202
So we must fight
at whatever cost

02:30.802 --> 02:36.286
Last week at the Army
recruiting station.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.899
What is your opinion
on this action?

02:40.943 --> 02:44.773
- My opinion is
you didn't go far enough.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.992
A bomb is nice,

02:47.036 --> 02:49.256
but it's gotta do damage.

02:49.299 --> 02:53.912
People have to die.

But we had nothing to do

detonated one bomb.

Peroxide, acetone.

It's highly unstable

09:32.659 --> 09:34.138
hate-spewing manifesto

09:34.182 --> 09:36.488
posted the day before
the first bomb went off

09:36.532 --> 09:39.056
at the Army recruiting center.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.972
- I know nothing
about any manifesto.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.148
- But it came
from inside your mosque.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.367
Over your Wi-Fi.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.848
We have the computer forensics
to prove it.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.241
- Your forensics prove nothing.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.461
I don't control the internet.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.724
Or any other people
in my community,

09:54.768 --> 09:56.421
or what they do or say.

09:56.465 --> 10:00.904
- Tell us about the Gauge Park
Islamic Relief Fund.

10:00.948 --> 10:04.255
Yeah, we ran your financials.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.606
- I assumed as much.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.870
- A charity

10:09.913 --> 10:11.611
for displaced refugees.

10:14.657 --> 10:18.008
- It's a 501c3.

10:18.052 --> 10:22.143
You can look it up
yourself, please.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.274
Now,

10:23.318 --> 10:27.409

charge me.

10:27.452 --> 10:31.718
If not, I'm leaving.

10:33.807 --> 10:34.938
- We should have held
onto him, Sarge.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.505
- Yeah, but we have
no evidence.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.028
- Yeah, but we could have
kept him in a cold cell

10:38.072 --> 10:39.726
for 47 hours
without evidence, right?

10:39.769 --> 10:41.684
- Relax.
We kicked the hornet's nest.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.294
Now let's see how Akeem reacts.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.123
- We found another
security camera

10:46.167 --> 10:48.038
near the VA,
outside a 7-Eleven.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.737
Look, this is our suspect
walking towards the VA

10:50.780 --> 10:52.390
five minutes
before the bombing.

10:52.434 --> 10:55.002
This is the suspect right after
the bombing, no backpack.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.394
- Did you text these pics
to Kevin?

10:56.438 --> 10:57.395
- Yeah, he recognizes the guy.

10:57.439 --> 10:58.701
His name is Tariq Hassam

10:58.745 --> 11:00.137
and I just got a match
on facial rec.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.531
He works at a loading dock
in Little Kabul.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.664
- Hit it.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.709
- Hey.
You the foreman?

11:06.753 --> 11:08.015
- We're looking for

11:08.058 --> 11:09.407
one of your workers,
Tariq Hassam.

11:10.582 --> 11:11.540

for him.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.541
Where is he?

11:12.584 --> 11:13.890
- He's loading a truck.

Find out who he called

16:52.228 --> 16:53.925
Easiest letter I ever wrote.

Okay, what's going on?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.070

No.

No.

17:20.996 --> 17:24.521
What, did you arrest him?

17:24.565 --> 17:26.958
- No, he's dead.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.790
- When we went to arrest him,

17:32.834 --> 17:36.881
Tariq killed himself.
He jumped off a building.

17:44.454 --> 17:45.716

17:45.760 --> 17:47.979
why didn't you ID Tariq
at the VA?

17:49.851 --> 17:54.290

away from him.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.466

the last person on Earth

18:04.909 --> 18:06.824
I would ever think would do
something like this.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.478
- Why, because
he loved America?

18:08.522 --> 18:09.827
- No.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.787
Because he hated extremists.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.137
When the Taliban found out
that he was working for us,

18:15.181 --> 18:19.010
they raped and killed
his wife.

We kinda lost touch.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.023
But make no mistake.

The Tariq that I knew
was a good man.

He was a patriot.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.742

paying attention.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.309

couple downed Apache pilots

18:59.703 --> 19:01.183

21:40.647 --> 21:42.301
- I asked who your guy was.

21:42.344 --> 21:45.434
You told me to go to hell,
remember?

21:52.920 --> 21:56.184
Look.
We're sorry.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.794
If we'd known beforehand,
it wouldn't have

21:57.838 --> 22:00.319
gone down like this.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.712
Okay?
- Okay.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.453
Let's move on

22:04.497 --> 22:06.716
and talk about these bombs.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.370
So why the raid?

22:08.414 --> 22:10.459
Is there something we need
to know about?

22:10.503 --> 22:12.287
- We picked up some chatter
this morning.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.028
Another attack is imminent.

22:14.071 --> 22:18.380
So we hit the mosque.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.123
- We're gonna talk to Akeem.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.951
Do what we have to

22:23.994 --> 22:27.215
to get him to talk to us.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.698
In the meantime,
I suggest we put you

22:31.741 --> 22:34.265
back in the cell
with the other suspects.

22:34.309 --> 22:37.312
See if you can gather
any more intel.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.535
- Yeah, I'm okay with that.

22:42.578 --> 22:45.364
- Okay.

22:48.889 --> 22:52.196
- Me and you gonna
sort this out one day.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.461
Next time no zip ties,
no batons.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.726
- Graff interrogated Akeem
for five hours.

22:59.769 --> 23:00.640
Didn't crack.

23:00.683 --> 23:01.858
Claims he knows nothing about

23:01.902 --> 23:02.859
the bomb, manifesto,

23:02.903 --> 23:03.947
Tariq, none of it.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.167
- Same thing.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.386
- Yeah, and I got nothing
on Tariq.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.387
Everybody I talked to said

23:08.430 --> 23:09.866
they thought he was off.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.520
Nobody actually knows him.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.217
Some people said they thought
he was undercover.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.481
- Well, regardless,
we have intel

23:15.524 --> 23:17.221
that another attack
is in the works.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.788
- Right, Graff said
that the new threat

23:18.832 --> 23:21.182
was posted online yesterday
at a Chicago public library.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.966
- All right, we got people
looking through surveillance

23:23.010 --> 23:24.315
but so far nothing.

23:24.359 --> 23:25.534
- Antonio and I have been
scrolling through

23:25.578 --> 23:26.709
Tariq's various phones.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.407
We found five or six photos

23:28.450 --> 23:30.234
of Tariq and another man,
about the same age,

23:30.278 --> 23:31.279
same ethnicity.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.367
- That was taken three days

23:32.411 --> 23:33.803
before the first bomb went off.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.022
- Yeah.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.284
Came back negative.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.546
- But we did get a hit
on bomb fragments.

23:37.590 --> 23:38.721
- Yes.
- Sixteen penny nails,

23:38.765 --> 23:39.548
to be exact.

23:39.592 --> 23:40.593
- All right, track down

23:40.636 --> 23:41.637
the specific batch number

23:41.681 --> 23:42.899
and find the distributor.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.423
- Already on it.
We got the lot number

23:44.466 --> 23:45.554
and delivery dates.
We're just closing in

23:45.598 --> 23:47.556
on retailers in the area.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.253
- More witness statements
from Patrol.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.908
- We're wasting our time.
We know who's responsible.

23:51.952 --> 23:54.171
- Well, we might have
missed something.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.391
Kim, Adam, split them up
and dig in.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.567
Kev, I want you back
at the mosque.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.090
See what you can learn.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.918
You two go find Miller.

24:01.962 --> 24:05.966
Maybe he can ID the guy
in the photo with Tariq.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.842
- Detective Halstead
and Detective Upton,

24:12.886 --> 24:15.454
Chicago PD.
Uh, we're here to see Jake.

24:16.585 --> 24:17.630
- Nothing's wrong, ma'am.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.370
We just have a few questions.

24:19.414 --> 24:21.764
- Oh, um, well, he's not here.

24:21.808 --> 24:25.202
- When does Jake
usually get home?

24:25.246 --> 24:27.161
- Uh, that depends.

24:27.204 --> 24:31.034
Why

24:33.384 --> 24:36.692
- Yeah, that's Tariq
and his cousin Rafi.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.739
- Jake and Tariq
served together

24:39.782 --> 24:42.393
and his cousin Rafi
is visiting from Kabul.

24:42.437 --> 24:43.917
We just had dinner last week.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.702
- Oh, so they still
see each other?

24:46.746 --> 24:48.617
- Yeah, of course.
Those two had

24:48.661 --> 24:50.837
a pretty powerful bond.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.580
The things that they saw,
that they did?

24:54.623 --> 24:58.366
They're like brothers.
They'd die for each other.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.197
That's a call to prayer.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.504
Happens five times a day.

25:05.547 --> 25:06.505
Makes Jake a little crazy.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.900
- You come home
after years at war,

25:10.944 --> 25:12.423
looking for a little
peace and quiet

25:12.467 --> 25:13.424
only to learn that
the very people

25:13.468 --> 25:14.600
you were fighting

25:14.643 --> 25:17.820
just moved in next door.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.169
- I get it, but...

25:19.213 --> 25:23.043
it's not the same people.
Just the same religion.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.087
- Well.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.088

25:25.132 --> 25:27.351

for your time.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.877

that we stopped by?

25:30.920 --> 25:32.835
- Yeah.

25:36.709 --> 25:37.840
- So Miller's lying about

25:37.884 --> 25:39.102
still being in touch
with Tariq.

25:39.146 --> 25:40.321
- Yeah.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.757
We got a hit yet
on that wholesaler?

25:41.801 --> 25:43.454

the nails used in the bomb?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.373
