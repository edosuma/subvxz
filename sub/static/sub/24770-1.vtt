WEBVTT

01:19.496 --> 01:21.623
Little Darc has been busy.

01:22.415 --> 01:28.713
Mr. Tagawa says he's teaching me
a valuable trade.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.508
Mr. Tagawa likes to sit on his fat ass.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.886
As long as he doesn't have to work,
he'll tell you anything.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.990
Hey, kid.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.536
Reading that comic again?

02:04.332 --> 02:05.250
"Darc."

02:14.425 --> 02:18.221
You want to be a hero, huh?

02:35.488 --> 02:37.949
Been working hard?
-I fixed the bench.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.161
You're a good boy, baby.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.372
I got you something.

02:54.799 --> 02:55.884
Open it.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.514
Mom...

03:02.390 --> 03:03.683
it's great.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.561
Thank you!

03:09.063 --> 03:10.398
I love you so much.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.624
You will... do...

03:29.459 --> 03:30.460
as...

03:30.710 --> 03:31.836
I...

03:31.920 --> 03:32.754
say!

03:46.059 --> 03:47.727
You little shit!

04:02.700 --> 04:03.618
Mom!

05:00.008 --> 05:01.175
Early release.

05:02.552 --> 05:03.469
This was you?

05:04.679 --> 05:05.513
Yeah.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.016
The answer is still no.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.060
Yeah, well, it's not the agency asking.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.730
It's me, personally.

05:13.938 --> 05:14.939
They got my daughter.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.482
KogaKai.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.571
Hear what I said?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.491
-Got a bus to catch.
-They took my daughter.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.243
Hey, do you hear me? Hey!

05:30.079 --> 05:30.913
Fuck.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.762
Been playing kachi

05:50.600 --> 05:51.684
What's this card?

05:52.393 --> 05:53.227
Juu

05:53.311 --> 05:55.730
The only card adopted from the West

05:56.022 --> 05:57.940
and it is totally worthless

05:58.441 --> 06:01.319
Only until late in the game.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.363
Then it can change everything.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.827
You should spend more time working
and less time gambling.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.513
Hey.

06:29.263 --> 06:30.431
Could you stop a second?

06:31.015 --> 06:32.642
My daughter's a nurse.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.976
She got nothing to do with them.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.604
All that shit, they got her holed up
three weeks now.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.190
Can you imagine the hell
she's been put through?

06:39.774 --> 06:40.942
'Cause I'm not going away, pal.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.528
I'll stick in your head
like a fucking aneurysm.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.282
It's KogaKai.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.576
What the hell do you think I can do?

06:51.494 --> 06:52.745
Whatever the hell I can't.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.542
You got a whole army of agents.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.210
OK.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.256
So Interpol gets involved now.
And they're looking for her.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.425
Where the hell do you think
we're gonna find her? Tell me.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.971
Sorry, can't help you.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.641
You know I got you an early release.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.476
I'll put you right the fuck back!

07:41.502 --> 07:43.254
Shit. Darc.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.507
You're... You're--

07:47.592 --> 07:48.509
You're out?

07:49.093 --> 07:51.929
Yeah, no shit.
What'd I tell you about being out here?

07:52.013 --> 07:53.431
Guess I need to teach you another lesson.

08:14.994 --> 08:15.828
Fuck!

08:17.288 --> 08:18.206
Fuck!

08:18.372 --> 08:20.166
You ain't the fucking cops, man.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.043
Stay out of here, motherfucker.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.420
Fuck.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.762
I keep the deposit.
<i>Comprende</i>, big man?

09:01.415 --> 09:02.625
You got to be fucking kidding me!

09:10.550 --> 09:11.717
What are you looking at?

09:13.553 --> 09:14.512
Excuse me?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.515
Do you wanna bring your ass out here
and help me? Or--

09:18.182 --> 09:19.934
Jeez, forget it.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.739
Just bring 'em in here, maybe.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.497
Just leave it, it's fine.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.796
Do you want an award or something?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.263
Hey, neighbor.

10:04.145 --> 10:04.979
Thank you.

10:37.094 --> 10:40.431
<i>Daddy. Please. Please don't--</i>

10:46.687 --> 10:48.230
<i>You want to keep her clean?</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:50.566
<i>You know what to do.</i>

11:06.624 --> 11:09.543
Just beer, not a marriage proposal.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.714
Thanks.

11:13.964 --> 11:14.965
Oh, he speaks.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.634
My name is...

11:16.884 --> 11:18.094
Ivana Mulligan.

11:18.594 --> 11:19.929
My friends call me Ivy.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.807
This is the part where you shake my hand.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.226
Jake Walters.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.978
People call me Darc.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.271
Darc. OK.

11:32.817 --> 11:33.776
Nice to meet you.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.527
When she was five,

12:17.361 --> 12:18.737
she fell off a swing.

12:20.739 --> 12:21.949
She went into a coma.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.578
A few days pass, she opens her eyes,

12:25.911 --> 12:28.998
and she looks at me and she says,
"I'm sorry, Daddy."

12:32.418 --> 12:33.294
Sorry. You're fit.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.924
You don't need this.
You don't need to do it for my daughter.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.011
You should do it for your mother.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.264
<i>Mom!</i>

12:48.767 --> 12:49.768
Come on, baby.

12:50.686 --> 12:51.770
Get them!

12:52.021 --> 12:53.772
Get fucking both of them!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.149
Move! Out of the way!

13:26.597 --> 13:27.848
Mom!
Go!

13:30.726 --> 13:31.644
Mom!

13:32.102 --> 13:33.687
Mom!

13:35.648 --> 13:36.982
She'll get the justice.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.777
I want it stopped.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.655
I want it stopped!

13:44.823 --> 13:48.285
Nobody just walks into the Yakuza.

13:55.751 --> 13:56.752
Kageyama.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.423
Toshio Kageyama.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.801
You recall that face?

14:12.226 --> 14:13.185
Mom!

14:15.646 --> 14:18.065
He's the one that ordered the kidnap.
He set it up.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.110
It's his son, the Oyabun.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.950
Go, baby, go, go!

14:28.993 --> 14:30.202
Fucking cunt!

14:31.120 --> 14:31.954
Momma!

14:32.037 --> 14:33.163
That's enough!

14:47.386 --> 14:48.888
No!

14:54.518 --> 14:55.936
Small world, huh?

15:02.776 --> 15:04.069
Why'd they take her?

15:05.112 --> 15:08.782
'Cause a bomb took my leg.
I went down, I came back.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.576
They want to own me.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.537
That's why they have her.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.831
This ain't about me, man.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.209
I don't give a shit
about what happens to me.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.297
It's about my daughter.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.760
Fucker!

16:10.928 --> 16:11.845
Let go!

16:13.013 --> 16:15.182
Get the police!

16:48.966 --> 16:50.092
For fuck's sake.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.308
Hi.  Wow!

16:58.809 --> 17:02.771
Almost didn't recognize you.
You really don't clean up half bad.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.565
-No.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.569
I'm pretty handy with a hammer.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.780
Do you think that this particular shelf
hung its fucking self?

17:13.782 --> 17:17.661
I just... I could...
I could go for a coffee, maybe.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.413
Bye, Ivy.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.756
There's a biker named Bronson.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.299
Toshio wants him dead.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.885
But they got him holed up
in town somewhere.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.357
There we go.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.778
Shigeru Kageyama

17:54.031 --> 17:55.491
Toshio's son.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.245
Kind of a stain
on the family name.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.042
The little Shig's going to try
to redeem himself

18:05.375 --> 18:06.835
in his old man's eyes.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.755
Shigeru needs help.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.184
You're up.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.271
You know who the fuck I am?

18:26.563 --> 18:27.397
Get off.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.235
Yeah, the little asshole
just tried to rip us off.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.703
I'll pay you what we agreed on.
No, the price just doubled.

18:41.787 --> 18:42.621
Fuck you.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.040
Wait, relax, all right.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.667
Fuck.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.336
Who the fuck are you? Hold him.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.964
Who the fuck are you, asshole?

18:52.172 --> 18:54.216
You have any idea who you're fucking with?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.552
-Come on.
Let's get him, guys.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.512
Stupid motherfucker.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.835
Where the fuck is Bronson?

19:29.918 --> 19:31.378
Where the fuck is he?

19:51.398 --> 19:52.941
Ah!

19:54.401 --> 19:55.527
Who the fuck are you?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.031
Hey, yo, wait.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.159
Hey, that was fucking awesome.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.828
Seriously, man, I owe you.
Let me buy you a drink.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.122
Got somewhere to be.
Come on.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.624
Just a drink.

20:08.999 --> 20:09.917
A talk.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.546
You don't like what I say, you walk away.
Keep the cash.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.180
What were you in for?

20:25.057 --> 20:26.058
Which time?

20:26.558 --> 20:28.310
Seriously, what for?

20:29.436 --> 20:30.520
I have a temper.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.189
I don't like idiots.

20:32.814 --> 20:33.982
Not a good combination.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.318
You ever kill anyone? Not officially.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.119
I'm working on something.
You could be helpful.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.955
You know nothing about me.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.498
You'll be checked out.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.750
But I need someone now. Someone good.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.253
And I know you are that, huh?

20:55.462 --> 20:56.672
Yeah? All right.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.174
-Give me your number.
-Don't have a phone.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.761
Never had a need for one.

21:11.937 --> 21:12.938
I'm taking your phone.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.237
Here's my number.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.114
And delete the rest.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.992
-We haven't discussed payment.
-Don't worry about that.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.236
Hi, am I interrupting anything?

22:01.737 --> 22:04.281
No I... I exercise when I'm bored.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.117
You must get bored a lot.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.372
I am really busy tonight, so I thought,
sorry, that we could have an early dinner.

22:12.914 --> 22:16.710
But, no funny business, we're just
neighbors. You fucking understand me?

22:17.502 --> 22:19.338
-I fucking do.
-OK.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.137
So, I can tell that...

22:28.472 --> 22:31.058
you're on the aloof end
of the social spectrum.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.685
Which is not a problem for me,
I tend to talk enough for two.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.064
But, the ex-con thing,
that may be an issue.

22:37.397 --> 22:40.358
If you were put in
for abusing women or children then,

22:40.692 --> 22:43.195
I gotta go.
And I'm gonna take my food with me.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.783
Seriously, though, I think
that there's no lower form of life

22:47.866 --> 22:49.326
than abusers of the innocent.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.661
No arguments from me.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.248
OK.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.085
OK, great.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.004
Let's eat.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.925
Going to get some plates, and what else?
Silverware, probably.

23:05.884 --> 23:06.885
No plates.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.930
I guess a corkscrew
is out of the question.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.432
Is out of the question, OK.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.897
-Hmm.
-OK, don't worry about it.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.732
I shouldn't have wine, anyways.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.026
If my students caught that on my breath, half of them would relapse
right there in class.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.906
We just stick to the pizza.

23:38.083 --> 23:38.959
Hi.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.172
So, what do you do?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.800
Keeps you so busy,
you can't even buy the basics.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.512
Sorry.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.310
Yeah?

23:58.812 --> 23:59.771
I know where.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.190
Yeah.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.696
What I do, I gotta do it now.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.615
-That's OK. OK.
-I'm sorry.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.788
We'll just share it later.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.499
I'd like that.

24:20.750 --> 24:21.585
OK.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.545
Well, I'll just...

24:24.796 --> 24:27.424
Have fun doing whatever it is you do.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.734
Four of them. Exit's on the other side.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.195
These assholes killed three of my men.

24:55.493 --> 24:56.536
You carrying?

24:57.787 --> 24:58.914
You know how to use a semi, right?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.500
All right.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.590
I... I take the inside.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.059
Come on, baby, daddy wants a queen.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.561
Daddy is a queen.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.105
Just fucking deal, Bronson.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.274
I win this hand, I'm next.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.319
Hey, girl, don't worry,
he won't even touch the sides.

25:55.428 --> 25:56.763
What the fuck is this?

25:57.722 --> 25:58.556
Go.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.108
Bronson, it's a Jap!

26:19.703 --> 26:21.079
Come on, you motherfucker!

26:47.272 --> 26:48.565
Die, Chink.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.529
Hey, I'm Japanese, asshole.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.531
Same fucking difference.

27:14.591 --> 27:17.260
Up there, that's where he is.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.220
My father.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.682
Emperor Toshio Kageyama.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.517
An important man.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.979
So very important.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.255
Open your files.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.930
As you can see from the chart...

28:02.013 --> 28:04.015
Since coming to the U.S...

28:10.772 --> 28:13.983
Gentlemen, please excuse the intrusion.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.905
I have something you've been
desperately looking for.

28:25.745 --> 28:26.913
Momma!

28:50.395 --> 28:54.315
For this, your interrupt business?

28:54.816 --> 28:58.027
I thought it was important.
You've been looking for him for weeks.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.613
Finally, I found him.

29:00.822 --> 29:01.948
Me...

29:02.198 --> 29:03.658
and my new friend.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.202
Jake Walters, my father.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.414
The honorable Toshio Kageyama.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.918
You brought a fucking <i>gaijin</i>

29:17.255 --> 29:18.923
My father thinks
you're a spy.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.635
I killed three men in front of a witness.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.724
You know any agency
that will condone that?

29:32.395 --> 29:33.980
Wait outside.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.742
Where did you find him?

29:46.242 --> 29:47.702
He saved my ass.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.954
And that's not suspicious to you?

29:50.038 --> 29:51.498
He killed in front of me.

29:52.665 --> 29:55.043
Besides, they would never try to get
a white guy inside.

29:55.376 --> 29:58.213
Because we don't expect it

29:58.421 --> 30:01.007
maybe that's exactly what they would do!

30:01.299 --> 30:04.594
This guy is seriously good.
I've never seen anyone like him.

30:05.929 --> 30:06.971
Trust me.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.099
Just this once.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.483
Remember this...

30:20.026 --> 30:22.654
Don't speak about
anything important around him.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.239
Of course.

30:25.156 --> 30:29.077
I only hope he is
as good as you say he is.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.995
I would stake my life on it.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.556
Let's go.

30:56.437 --> 30:57.689
Get me the Dragons.

31:06.155 --> 31:07.240
Fuck, yeah.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.201
This is just the beginning.

31:10.285 --> 31:13.580
Your brawn and my brain,
we're going to build am empire.

31:31.931 --> 31:35.059
If you see anything you like,
she's on the house.

31:36.644 --> 31:37.896
Kind of particular.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.607
Hey, not me.

31:40.940 --> 31:43.359
Have a look around,
I'm sure you'll find something.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.712
<i>Gaijin.</i>

32:45.588 --> 32:46.631
Is there a problem?

32:46.714 --> 32:49.133
Yeah, you.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.505
Shit. You OK, man?

34:51.005 --> 34:52.048
You OK

34:53.299 --> 34:55.301
-Thanks for the help.
-I couldn't.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.303
It was a test.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.071
As a <i>gaijin</i>,

35:15.613 --> 35:17.073
you'll never be Yakuza.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.282
I'm just here for the money.

35:18.741 --> 35:19.992
Do your job,

35:20.701 --> 35:22.453
and you'll be well rewarded.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.288
I've already done one job.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.502
Didn't you pay him?

35:35.174 --> 35:36.300
Huh?

35:51.649 --> 35:52.483
Wait.

35:58.906 --> 36:01.367
You caused a great deal of damage
to my club.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.744
Kanji will drive you home.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.496
-I'll take a cab.
-No.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.331
You work for us.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.167
We'll get you home.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.018
Find out everything you can.

36:27.727 --> 36:31.314
This <i>gaijin</i> is hiding something.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.153
Shigeru-san, sent me.

36:48.456 --> 36:51.417
They're waiting to drive me back.
Please, if I don't stay...

36:54.337 --> 36:55.796
I can be very good to you.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.382
Do things that'll take your mind
off your injuries.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.551
Come in. Please.

37:09.894 --> 37:10.978
Have a seat.

37:15.983 --> 37:17.735
Ah! No corkscrew.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.783
Maybe I can help with that.

37:27.662 --> 37:28.496
Wait.

37:39.882 --> 37:42.051
-Please.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.099
That worked.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.310
You wouldn't happened to have brought
any glasses with you.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.021
Who needs a glass.

38:00.152 --> 38:02.488
-It's pretty bad.

38:03.322 --> 38:04.615
Perfect with cold pizza.  Those things will kill you.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.124
You're right.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.302
Why are you here?

38:26.512 --> 38:28.097
Why are you here, Lisa?

38:29.682 --> 38:30.933
I'm not judging.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.729
My mother was in the trade.

38:36.939 --> 38:37.940
She had no choice.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.447
My family borrowed money from Toshio-san.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.908
The business went bad...

38:48.576 --> 38:51.037
-Until the debt's paid off--
-So if you disappear,

38:51.662 --> 38:52.621
so does your family.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.836
-Hmm!
-You need to get some rest.

39:01.714 --> 39:02.548
Wait.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.347
My mother never had any money of her own.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.017
Buy something nice for yourself.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.421
That's my fuckin' pizza.

40:01.315 --> 40:02.149
So what?

40:02.775 --> 40:05.486
-Need more information.
-Hey, I wanna know my daughter's alive.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.239
That's the problem with today's cops.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.199
No trust in the public.

40:13.869 --> 40:14.703
<i>Daddy?</i>

40:15.246 --> 40:16.122
<i>Daddy?</i>

40:16.247 --> 40:18.499
Baby, listen to me. Listen to me!
<i>Daddy!</i>

40:22.211 --> 40:23.629
Need to know who this is.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.506
I'll text you a copy.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.094
You better wrap your head around this.
'Cause if one thing happens to her,

40:30.428 --> 40:32.221
I'm coming for you! You hear me?

40:48.279 --> 40:50.072
So, she hit the spot.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.366
The bitch I sent you?

40:53.451 --> 40:55.035
I saw how you looked at her.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.788
Seems all you white fuckers
like a bit of yellow.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.416
But most of the girls
in the club were white.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.460
Where do they come from?

41:03.085 --> 41:04.545
All over the world, buddy.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.590
Why do you think we got into
the shipping business?

41:10.551 --> 41:12.511
You planning on starting out on your own?

41:13.262 --> 41:14.180
What do you think?

41:17.766 --> 41:21.479
I think you're smart enough to know
what would happen to you if you tried.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.234
There. Pull over.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.695
So, what do these guys owe you?

41:29.778 --> 41:32.573
It's not a lot of money.
It's the disrespect. You know, China people not paying
sets a bad example.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.167
Do you what Japanese really like?

41:44.001 --> 41:45.586
Sushi and golf.

42:05.981 --> 42:08.275
Wait, wait, please!
We didn't have a choice. We didn't--

42:12.029 --> 42:13.864
Everyone has a choice.

42:13.948 --> 42:16.450
-They make us, they make us!

42:16.534 --> 42:18.035
Triple Eight triad!

42:18.285 --> 42:19.745
Triple Eight triad!

42:19.912 --> 42:21.705
They said they would take it over.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.749
And you believed them. -Fucking Chinese!
-The register!

42:30.631 --> 42:34.843
-Take it. Whatever we have is yours!
-Damn straight, old woman.

42:40.391 --> 42:43.269
This will always be
KogaKai territory, granny.

42:44.311 --> 42:45.354
Remember that.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.818
Apologies for the interruption, folks.

42:57.324 --> 42:58.701
Enjoy your meals.

43:01.161 --> 43:03.163
Looks like we got to go hunting.

43:04.331 --> 43:07.084
Time to visit Lee at the Triple Eight.

43:47.541 --> 43:48.709
Hey! Hey!

45:00.280 --> 45:01.615
Fucking Chinese!

45:09.623 --> 45:10.833
Help!

45:19.007 --> 45:20.259
Please, I'm unarmed.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.761
No witnesses.

45:49.580 --> 45:50.747
Where is Lee?

45:52.416 --> 45:53.917
Where the fuck is Lee?

46:06.430 --> 46:07.681
Relax ladies.

46:08.056 --> 46:09.433
I don't kill women.

46:10.684 --> 46:11.852
Unless they deserve it.

46:12.478 --> 46:13.937
-No!

46:15.189 --> 46:16.440
There you go then.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.066
Let's go.

46:18.775 --> 46:19.985
Grab everything you can.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.671
Shigeru-san, back in a minute.

47:22.172 --> 47:23.048
Shigeru.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.718
Where's your new friend?

47:26.885 --> 47:28.595
Somewhere around here...

47:28.679 --> 47:30.097
He'll be back soon.

47:53.829 --> 47:56.915
I see you again,
I'll drown you in your own fat.

48:04.006 --> 48:05.340
Drown him in his own fat?

48:06.592 --> 48:07.634
You OK?

48:08.844 --> 48:11.555
Who are you?
What are you really doing here?

48:12.055 --> 48:13.348
I'm looking for someone.

48:15.350 --> 48:16.184
A girl.

48:17.894 --> 48:19.187
Renee Lafique.

48:21.648 --> 48:22.566
She was here.

48:22.816 --> 48:24.276
-I took her food.

48:24.526 --> 48:26.028
They moved her a few days ago.

48:26.486 --> 48:27.362
To where?

48:28.196 --> 48:29.239
I don't know.

48:30.824 --> 48:32.367
They've got businesses everywhere.

48:33.619 --> 48:35.621
Shipping yards, motels, private homes.

48:37.247 --> 48:38.165
Think, Lisa.

48:38.457 --> 48:40.125
Maybe someone mentioned something.

48:41.084 --> 48:42.252
I have to find her. I'll try to find out.

48:48.759 --> 48:51.345
-If she ends up back here, I can call you.
-Be careful.

48:53.722 --> 48:54.681
You too.

48:56.350 --> 48:58.727
They'd pay a lot for this information.

49:10.614 --> 49:13.283
If Renee's taken back
to the brothel, she'll call me.

49:13.533 --> 49:14.951
What do you mean

49:15.535 --> 49:16.828
That's all you fuckin' got? Do you understand the longer you're there,

49:18.372 --> 49:20.040
the more of a chance
they find out who you are.

49:20.582 --> 49:22.501
They're asking questions now
for Christ sakes.

49:22.584 --> 49:23.919
Give them what they want.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.505
Be a smart cop, leave out Japan.

49:27.047 --> 49:31.843
Oh, come on, you're supposed to make shit
happen. That's why I got you out. Christ.

49:32.719 --> 49:34.429
You gotta do something, goddamn it!

49:36.431 --> 49:37.265
Do something?

49:37.349 --> 49:39.601
Well, how much longer
do you think we've got?

49:40.852 --> 49:41.687
OK.

49:42.854 --> 49:45.273
Wha... What does that mean? OK.

49:48.110 --> 49:49.486
Time to make shit happen.

50:20.851 --> 50:21.977
That's everything.

50:23.478 --> 50:25.147
What I could find anyway.

50:27.107 --> 50:28.817
You gave me short notice, you know.

50:30.861 --> 50:32.279
You're making excuses?

50:33.238 --> 50:34.823
Well, that makes me suspicious.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.158
No excuses. Hey, what do you want me to say?

50:38.869 --> 50:40.454
You want me to say he's bad fucking news?

50:41.371 --> 50:42.247
All right.

50:42.956 --> 50:44.958
He's bad fucking news.

51:55.445 --> 51:58.448
<i>Couldn't imagine the American</i>
<i>back line hold defense like that.</i>

52:07.582 --> 52:10.335
<i>Vasquez! Yes, yes, he's through.</i>
<i>He's through.</i>

52:11.378 --> 52:14.381
<i>He drops the ball</i>
<i>before he makes the edge.</i>

52:15.632 --> 52:17.968
<i>He's out of the game, how unfortunate.</i>

53:39.507 --> 53:40.800
You motherfucker.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.595
You are so dead.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.107
Stay in here.

54:11.790 --> 54:12.624
You!

54:13.500 --> 54:14.834
I fucking knew it.

54:17.754 --> 54:21.007
Get help!

54:21.758 --> 54:24.719
You hear me, girl?

54:25.178 --> 54:28.056
Do it and your family debt is clean!

54:28.640 --> 54:30.016
Good offer.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.770
If I were her, I'd take it.

54:37.524 --> 54:39.067
Who the fuck are you?

54:39.567 --> 54:40.694
Think back.

54:44.030 --> 54:44.864
Japan.

54:46.074 --> 54:46.992
Chiba.

54:47.951 --> 54:48.827
An alley.

54:53.164 --> 54:54.207
Whore.

54:55.750 --> 54:56.835
Her throat,

54:57.752 --> 54:59.087
slit.

55:00.422 --> 55:02.173
I was eight years old.

55:09.180 --> 55:10.306
Darc boy?

55:10.932 --> 55:13.268
I'm gonna kill you Toshio-san.

55:14.352 --> 55:15.812
We both know that.

55:16.229 --> 55:17.147
Unless,

55:17.480 --> 55:19.524
tell me where Renee Lafique is.

55:24.612 --> 55:25.613
Where?

55:29.200 --> 55:31.453
OK. OK.

55:35.874 --> 55:36.916
She's...

55:38.877 --> 55:41.463
Your momma had some good moves.

55:56.269 --> 55:58.980
You fucking idiot!

56:00.732 --> 56:04.277
We'd never hide her
in such a public place.

56:39.145 --> 56:39.979
Jake.

56:47.403 --> 56:48.530
You should've left.

56:49.155 --> 56:50.281
I almost did.

56:51.991 --> 56:53.243
They know I'm here.

56:54.369 --> 56:55.620
You can't just leave me.

56:57.664 --> 56:59.916
They'll torture me, I'll tell them
everything and they'll kill me.

57:02.669 --> 57:03.503
Lisa. Do it.

57:11.136 --> 57:12.095
Do it.

57:14.264 --> 57:15.181
Please.

57:49.883 --> 57:50.758
Come with us.

57:56.264 --> 57:57.432
That's a big gun.

57:58.057 --> 57:59.017
It's a big world.

57:59.767 --> 58:01.352
They're just business associates.

58:01.436 --> 58:04.022
Well, they're being loud.
I'd like them to go.

58:04.481 --> 58:06.399
Oyabun is on his way from Japan.

58:07.275 --> 58:08.485
Shigeru needs you.

58:10.403 --> 58:11.654
Wait outside.

58:12.363 --> 58:14.282
This gun is getting real heavy, boys.

58:15.241 --> 58:17.118
It might just go off any minute.

58:31.883 --> 58:33.676
You're a taciturn bastard.

58:34.594 --> 58:37.180
The people you associate yourself with,

58:38.014 --> 58:39.474
they speak volumes.

58:52.862 --> 58:54.822
-He'll be with us soon.

59:02.330 --> 59:03.414
<i>One more time.</i>

59:04.374 --> 59:06.251
Where'd you get these tattoos?

59:08.753 --> 59:09.671
Do it!

59:16.469 --> 59:18.221
Tell me who sent you, <i>gaijin</i>.

59:19.597 --> 59:21.391
Did Toshio

59:22.392 --> 59:23.726
Is that why you killed him?

59:26.646 --> 59:27.814
Hit him!

59:28.189 --> 59:29.190
Harder!

59:31.776 --> 59:33.111
Harder!

59:34.320 --> 59:35.488
Do it again!

59:38.157 --> 59:39.200
Get out.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.370
He doesn't work for you

59:42.662 --> 59:43.746
Get out.

59:45.123 --> 59:46.958
Get out of or I'll fucking castrate you!

59:51.629 --> 59:53.172
Who brought him here?

59:53.923 --> 59:54.882
Me.

59:55.091 --> 59:57.719
Who put you in charge?

59:58.344 --> 59:59.512
Look at his tattoos.

1:00:00.221 --> 1:00:02.056
He is not who he says he is.

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:03.808
I knew about them!

1:00:04.642 --> 1:00:06.311
It's one of the reasons I hired him!

1:00:06.394 --> 1:00:07.854
What the fuck do you know?

1:00:08.229 --> 1:00:10.481
You were born in America.

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:12.650
I was Toshi's aide.

1:00:13.735 --> 1:00:16.112
He was my friend.

1:00:17.030 --> 1:00:18.656
He was my father!

1:00:20.783 --> 1:00:25.913
And he regretted that every day.

1:00:31.794 --> 1:00:34.380
You were my father's pet dog.

1:00:35.256 --> 1:00:37.884
Just a translator. Nothing more.

1:00:38.676 --> 1:00:40.553
The only reason I don't kill you...

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:43.431
My grandfather will want to know
where you were when my father died!

1:00:58.237 --> 1:00:59.322
Taking you home.

1:01:00.615 --> 1:01:01.574
And, Jake,

1:01:02.033 --> 1:01:03.159
don't go too far.

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:05.662
You and I have a lot to discuss.

1:02:15.481 --> 1:02:17.358
What about the whore?

1:02:19.944 --> 1:02:22.488
It's strange she was the only one
left alive.

1:02:22.655 --> 1:02:24.031
She was knocked out.

1:02:24.198 --> 1:02:28.286
She called us as soon as she came round.

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:31.289
Why would she do that if she was involved?

1:02:31.414 --> 1:02:32.999
-The <i>gaijin</i> is the--
-Not again.

1:02:34.083 --> 1:02:37.712
He has done everything we've asked of him.

1:02:38.004 --> 1:02:39.046
For money.

1:02:44.802 --> 1:02:46.053
Enough.

1:02:47.555 --> 1:02:49.557
If the <i>gaijin</i> is innocent

1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:52.185
then the attack was carried out
by someone else.

1:02:54.312 --> 1:02:55.271
Shigeru.

1:02:56.439 --> 1:02:59.817
Find out who and clear his name.

1:03:00.151 --> 1:03:01.194
Kanji.

1:03:01.444 --> 1:03:05.782
When this is over,
I want to hear about how Toshio died

1:03:06.115 --> 1:03:09.744
while you were responsible
for his security.

1:03:10.328 --> 1:03:11.621
And both of you,

1:03:11.913 --> 1:03:13.331
remember this well.

1:03:15.249 --> 1:03:17.668
We are Yakuza.

1:03:18.753 --> 1:03:23.174
No individual is more important
than the family.

1:03:41.567 --> 1:03:43.653
I think
you owe me an explanation.

1:03:49.742 --> 1:03:51.035
Oh, my God.

1:03:52.119 --> 1:03:53.204
What happened to you?

1:03:53.704 --> 1:03:55.331
I bruise easily.

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.169
You're such an asshole. Come on.

1:04:04.131 --> 1:04:06.008
Let me talk to the cop.

1:04:08.928 --> 1:04:13.432
This cop's mine. Get your own source.

1:04:14.058 --> 1:04:16.394
Speak fuckin' English,
asshole.

1:04:18.354 --> 1:04:20.231
No individual's more important

1:04:20.314 --> 1:04:21.816
than the family.

1:04:40.835 --> 1:04:41.711
Tell me.

1:04:41.794 --> 1:04:44.672
If you trust me, this isn't something
you want to know about.

1:04:47.466 --> 1:04:48.426
I want to know.

1:04:55.433 --> 1:04:56.976
They kidnapped someone.

1:04:58.311 --> 1:05:00.813
-I'm trying to find her.

1:05:00.897 --> 1:05:04.025
-'Cause it's a cop's daughter.

1:05:05.610 --> 1:05:08.279
-He came to me.
-Oh!

1:05:10.114 --> 1:05:13.659
-I gotta go. I gotta get out there.
-OK. OK.

1:05:13.951 --> 1:05:16.329
I don't know if you're going to be
any help to anybody right now.

1:05:16.412 --> 1:05:18.331
Don't be an idiot. Come on, OK.

1:05:22.293 --> 1:05:23.544
Come this way.

1:05:29.759 --> 1:05:31.552
Ivy, I...

1:05:32.428 --> 1:05:34.013
I just wanted to tell you...

1:05:36.807 --> 1:05:37.725
sorry.

1:05:47.985 --> 1:05:48.986
Wuss.

1:05:59.705 --> 1:06:01.457
Where's Kanji?
-Fuck Kanji.

1:06:03.459 --> 1:06:04.585
-Get out!
-Calm down.

1:06:07.797 --> 1:06:09.507
Play fucking stupid with me. I dare you! -I'm mot playing stupi--

1:06:12.051 --> 1:06:13.844
I'm not going to ask you again. Who?

1:06:16.055 --> 1:06:16.889
Lee.

1:06:19.850 --> 1:06:20.685
Lee.

1:06:24.188 --> 1:06:25.231
From Triple Eight.

1:06:41.872 --> 1:06:42.707
Never.

1:06:43.082 --> 1:06:45.626
No, no. He can't be.
He doesn't have the balls.

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:47.962
And what if he shot up your place, huh?

1:06:48.421 --> 1:06:49.714
What if he killed your men?

1:06:49.797 --> 1:06:50.923
What the fuck would you have done?

1:06:51.007 --> 1:06:53.467
Your job's to keep people
from fucking back.

1:06:54.510 --> 1:06:55.553
You fuckhead.

1:06:55.761 --> 1:06:57.013
If you're not doing that,

1:06:58.806 --> 1:07:01.183
why the fuck do we need
your little bitch daughter?

1:07:22.997 --> 1:07:24.373
You are certain it was him?

1:07:24.790 --> 1:07:25.875
He admitted it.

1:07:26.584 --> 1:07:29.003
His final words.

1:07:29.378 --> 1:07:31.047
How did you find out?

1:07:31.297 --> 1:07:33.507
I suspected from the beginning.

1:07:33.799 --> 1:07:36.719
Our Interpol dog confirmed it.

1:07:36.802 --> 1:07:40.389
The same man who provided
the dossier on your partner?

1:07:40.473 --> 1:07:43.559
That's right. He's been very useful.

1:07:43.976 --> 1:07:47.646
So, your friend is cleared.

1:07:48.939 --> 1:07:50.441
As I expected.

1:07:53.235 --> 1:07:56.739
Shigeru, you've done well.

1:07:58.699 --> 1:08:02.828
You're becoming the man
we always hoped you would.

1:09:48.350 --> 1:09:50.352
Sorry for the interruption

1:09:50.853 --> 1:09:52.062
But we have more information.

1:09:53.147 --> 1:09:58.402
There were important details
omitted from the policeman's dossier.

1:10:03.324 --> 1:10:07.786
<i>Only until late in the game.</i>

1:10:08.996 --> 1:10:11.290
<i>Then it can change everything.</i>

1:10:22.801 --> 1:10:23.802
Hey.

1:10:24.428 --> 1:10:25.846
He's alive.

1:10:28.182 --> 1:10:29.683
How did I get here?

1:10:30.392 --> 1:10:31.560
You don't remember.

1:10:32.353 --> 1:10:34.605
Those pills I gave you
really knocked you out.

1:10:35.105 --> 1:10:36.565
Ivy, how long have I been out?

1:10:36.649 --> 1:10:41.487
-Ah... Sixteen hours.
-Damn it, I got to go.

1:10:42.279 --> 1:10:43.864
Yeah, 'cause you seem fine.

1:10:46.283 --> 1:10:48.118
Ivy, there's a girl's life on the line.

1:10:51.163 --> 1:10:54.166
So, you're gonna risk yours to save hers.

1:11:05.094 --> 1:11:08.889
I'm told, you're the last person
to see my son alive.

1:11:09.431 --> 1:11:12.059
You'll tell us exactly what happened.

1:11:12.893 --> 1:11:14.979
And before you begin,

1:11:15.813 --> 1:11:17.064
you should know,

1:11:17.523 --> 1:11:20.693
I have a man on the way
to your family's home.

1:11:32.997 --> 1:11:33.956
Huh!

1:11:36.041 --> 1:11:37.626
I brought your pain killers.

1:11:38.377 --> 1:11:41.297
Supposed to take two.
They're really potent.

1:11:41.797 --> 1:11:42.631
So...

1:11:50.014 --> 1:11:51.765
OK, or six.

1:11:53.350 --> 1:11:56.895
-Ivy, you know--
-No, I'm sorry. I...

1:12:00.774 --> 1:12:01.942
Peace offering.

1:12:02.276 --> 1:12:04.528
Unless you were planning on hitching.

1:12:12.578 --> 1:12:13.495
Just come back.

1:12:17.541 --> 1:12:18.542
I promise.

1:12:36.435 --> 1:12:39.313
Please, please, please.

1:12:44.943 --> 1:12:46.945
All this for one woman?

1:12:47.237 --> 1:12:50.532
Two, if you count his mother.

1:12:51.575 --> 1:12:54.620
Bring me this woman.
And find Kanji and Shigeru.

1:13:18.602 --> 1:13:20.062
Grandfather?

1:13:32.074 --> 1:13:33.242
Yeah?
<i>Hey, something went wrong.</i>

1:13:33.325 --> 1:13:34.576
<i>Something really went fucking wrong.</i>

1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:37.037
They just told me to pick my daughter
up at the docks.

1:13:37.121 --> 1:13:38.247
What the fuck does that mean?

1:13:38.330 --> 1:13:39.248
<i>Lafique--</i>
-They know.

1:13:39.331 --> 1:13:41.250
Where?
-Pier 9.

1:13:41.333 --> 1:13:43.127
Wait outside. Do not go on your own.

1:13:44.044 --> 1:13:46.046
<i></i>
-A cartload of shit.

1:14:13.574 --> 1:14:14.533
Where's my daughter?

1:14:14.616 --> 1:14:17.369
You were warned what would happen to her
if you ever lied to us.

1:14:17.453 --> 1:14:18.328
So, where's my daughter?

1:14:23.625 --> 1:14:25.085
Are you fucking insane?

1:14:25.169 --> 1:14:26.753
Are you fucking insane?

1:14:27.171 --> 1:14:28.297
Hey!

1:14:41.268 --> 1:14:42.561
Baby! Baby!

1:14:46.815 --> 1:14:48.025
Come on, listen to me.

1:14:48.442 --> 1:14:49.276
Cut her down.

1:14:51.653 --> 1:14:54.823
-I'll tell you everything.
-We already know everything.

1:15:04.416 --> 1:15:05.459
Baby!

1:15:10.255 --> 1:15:11.089
Cut her down! Cut her down!

1:15:14.468 --> 1:15:15.302
Cut her down.

1:16:16.321 --> 1:16:17.322
No!

1:16:20.325 --> 1:16:21.994
Renee, your dad's with me.

1:16:23.245 --> 1:16:24.204
Renee.

1:16:24.913 --> 1:16:25.747
Renee? Lisa.

1:16:30.002 --> 1:16:30.836
Lisa.

1:16:31.253 --> 1:16:32.254
I'm sorry.

1:16:38.844 --> 1:16:39.928
I got you.

1:16:40.554 --> 1:16:42.431
I told them, they know. They know.

1:16:42.973 --> 1:16:43.807
I know. That's all right.

1:16:47.477 --> 1:16:49.521
Get away! Go!

1:16:57.613 --> 1:16:59.740
He fucking lied to me!

1:17:00.324 --> 1:17:03.619
All this time, he's been lying to me,
making a fool of me!

1:17:03.952 --> 1:17:06.997
Faster, you fucking monkey! Faster!

1:17:07.456 --> 1:17:08.749
Faster!

1:17:27.559 --> 1:17:28.685
Where is he?

1:17:31.271 --> 1:17:32.564
Where the fuck is he?

1:17:48.872 --> 1:17:50.332
Where the fuck is he?

1:17:50.415 --> 1:17:52.459
He's not fucking here!

1:18:01.468 --> 1:18:02.678
Get off me!

1:18:13.563 --> 1:18:14.731
Tell me!

1:18:15.941 --> 1:18:17.693
Where the fuck is he?

1:18:31.623 --> 1:18:32.457
Enough!

1:18:33.875 --> 1:18:34.793
Don't!

1:18:34.876 --> 1:18:37.796
-I fucking vouched for you!
-Drop the knife.

1:18:37.963 --> 1:18:40.882
Those tattoos, the night we met,

1:18:41.216 --> 1:18:43.093
it wasn't just chance, was it?

1:18:44.177 --> 1:18:46.304
-Let her go, Shigeru.

1:18:46.513 --> 1:18:48.140
She's just my neighbor.

1:18:48.890 --> 1:18:49.725
Shigeru.

1:18:51.685 --> 1:18:54.104
Fuck you, and all your fucking lies!

1:18:54.730 --> 1:18:56.022
Move! Secure him.

1:18:58.108 --> 1:18:59.151
It's pointless.

1:19:00.152 --> 1:19:03.321
It'll just be you and me.

1:19:04.656 --> 1:19:08.285
You will never be Oyabun.

1:19:09.995 --> 1:19:12.372
You fucking...

1:19:13.540 --> 1:19:14.666
Do it.

1:19:14.916 --> 1:19:17.627
The last thing you're gonna see
will be the inside of her throat.

1:19:18.253 --> 1:19:20.922
-No, no, no.
-On your fucking knees, you piece of shit.

1:19:22.382 --> 1:19:23.341
Secure him!

1:19:24.259 --> 1:19:25.719
Hands behind your back!

1:19:26.636 --> 1:19:28.305
Ivy, it's OK.

1:19:32.017 --> 1:19:33.226
It's OK.

1:19:34.603 --> 1:19:35.520
Shigeru.

1:19:40.484 --> 1:19:41.943
She's innocent.

1:19:42.235 --> 1:19:43.653
Shigeru-san,

1:19:44.488 --> 1:19:45.739
let her go.

1:19:48.992 --> 1:19:49.826
Fuck it.

1:19:56.082 --> 1:19:56.917
No!

1:20:30.408 --> 1:20:31.368
Enough!

1:20:35.121 --> 1:20:36.623
Put him in a chair

1:20:43.129 --> 1:20:44.130
Leave us.

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:49.803
Shigeru, you too.

1:20:51.096 --> 1:20:52.222
Oyabun, please.

1:21:08.321 --> 1:21:09.698
Look at me.

1:21:22.836 --> 1:21:26.006
There was a boy once, a lifetime ago,

1:21:27.424 --> 1:21:30.051
with a whore for a mother.

1:21:31.386 --> 1:21:32.846
That he was even allowed to live,

1:21:32.929 --> 1:21:34.806
was a mistake.

1:21:35.223 --> 1:21:39.019
I can't recall most
of the men I've killed,

1:21:39.436 --> 1:21:40.562
but women,

1:21:41.396 --> 1:21:43.857
there's something different about them.

1:21:47.777 --> 1:21:50.488
You want to kill me, Darc?

1:21:54.951 --> 1:21:56.411
It's like you said,

1:21:57.787 --> 1:21:59.414
it was a lifetime ago.

1:22:01.416 --> 1:22:04.252
And yet, my son died in the present.

1:22:04.502 --> 1:22:05.962
Get that little shit in here.

1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:13.261
He's weak, he's ambitious,
perhaps, even he's a coward.

1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:17.474
But it is his duty to avenge
his father's death.

1:22:19.309 --> 1:22:20.602
Oyabun, I...

1:22:25.398 --> 1:22:29.444
You will take him away and deal with him.

1:22:34.074 --> 1:22:35.367
Leave it to me.

1:22:35.742 --> 1:22:38.328
You will take Mr. Kimuro with you.

1:22:39.412 --> 1:22:40.497
Wait a second, Oya...

1:22:40.789 --> 1:22:42.332
You'll do what I say!

1:22:47.587 --> 1:22:48.797
I understand.

1:24:35.737 --> 1:24:36.821
Jake.

1:24:39.991 --> 1:24:41.034
Come on, Jake.

1:24:44.913 --> 1:24:47.582
I fucking saved your life, Jake.

1:24:48.333 --> 1:24:50.460
Fucking saved your life.

1:24:51.377 --> 1:24:52.545
I have money.

1:24:52.712 --> 1:24:54.339
You and I can start something.

1:24:54.839 --> 1:24:57.884
It was just a fucking girl! Come on.

1:24:59.511 --> 1:25:01.221
Jake, please.

1:25:01.471 --> 1:25:02.680
Come on, Jake.

1:25:03.264 --> 1:25:05.475
Jake, come on. Jake, please.

1:25:05.892 --> 1:25:07.435
Jake, Jake, Jake!

1:25:07.727 --> 1:25:09.312
Please, please don't.

1:25:10.063 --> 1:25:11.439
Jake, please!

1:25:28.623 --> 1:25:30.250
Prepare the men.

1:26:42.530 --> 1:26:44.365
Get out! Move it, move!

1:26:44.824 --> 1:26:46.075
Move, get out, move!

1:29:12.638 --> 1:29:13.723
Juu...

1:29:15.099 --> 1:29:18.019
the card that can change everything.

1:29:22.690 --> 1:29:26.235
Are you here to save the girl?

1:29:26.861 --> 1:29:28.488
Or avenge your mother?

1:29:29.197 --> 1:29:30.907
You don't even know anymore.

1:29:34.243 --> 1:29:35.119
Drop it.

1:29:37.830 --> 1:29:39.415
You want to save her?

1:29:39.999 --> 1:29:42.710
Or let her end up like your whore mother?

1:29:56.057 --> 1:29:57.850
You're already dead.

1:29:58.518 --> 1:29:59.852
So, end it now,

1:30:00.103 --> 1:30:01.604
and I'll let her live.

1:30:09.821 --> 1:30:10.738
Her life.

1:30:11.531 --> 1:30:12.949
Or yours.

1:30:48.484 --> 1:30:49.485
I'm sorry.

1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:53.739
Do it, or else.

1:31:16.429 --> 1:31:17.889
Of course,

1:31:18.347 --> 1:31:20.349
where I'm going to send her,

1:31:20.975 --> 1:31:23.144
she will be begging for death.

1:31:23.811 --> 1:31:24.979
She will wish--

1:31:38.409 --> 1:31:39.243
Mister.

1:31:48.544 --> 1:31:50.922
Stay with me. Stay with me!

1:31:54.759 --> 1:31:55.718
Breathe!

1:31:56.052 --> 1:31:59.639
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1:32:00.389 --> 1:32:01.641
Come on, breathe!
