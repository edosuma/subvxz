WEBVTT

00:03.404 --> 00:05.281
We're gonna change that one.

00:05.363 --> 00:07.594
I'm back!

00:07.682 --> 00:10.675
Okay, let me
see, let me see, let me see.

00:10.762 --> 00:12.833
You guys are gonna
want to, um-

00:12.922 --> 00:16.393
Oh, my God! I love it!

00:16.482 --> 00:17.881
All clear.

00:19.082 --> 00:20.913
- Okay, so-
- Oh! Oh!

00:21.001 --> 00:23.560
It's so good. It is so good.

00:23.641 --> 00:25.200
Oh!
For the last few months,

00:25.281 --> 00:28.115
Cam and I have been redoing a house
together that we're gonna flip,

00:28.200 --> 00:30.157
and I have to say,
it has been goin' great.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.118
We make an amazing team.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.311
Yeah. The key is trust.
Absolutely.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.355
The key is,

00:35.440 --> 00:37.671
I let Claire think she's in charge.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.995
I hide what I want...

00:39.080 --> 00:40.992
in something bigger and more expensive.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.433
Then when she rejects that,

00:42.518 --> 00:45.829
we "compromise" on what I wanted all along.

00:45.918 --> 00:47.637
I call my method "the Trojan horse."

00:47.719 --> 00:50.359
You know how I got Lily?
I asked Mitchell for triplets.

00:50.479 --> 00:51.548
Okay.
Uh-huh?

00:51.637 --> 00:52.673
You are going to love...

00:52.798 --> 00:55.756
what I found for the
kitchen counter tops. Mmm.

00:56.637 --> 00:58.356
It's from Carrara, Italy.
Oh!

00:58.478 --> 01:01.833
It's where Michelangelo got the
marble to make the David. Oh.

01:01.916 --> 01:04.875
Now we know why the David
couldn't afford any clothes.

01:04.956 --> 01:06.709
Okay, well, uh-

01:06.797 --> 01:08.833
I also found this one.

01:08.917 --> 01:11.714
It's not as nice,
but it's less expensive.

01:11.796 --> 01:15.152
Well, it's still over budget, but...
I guess it's okay.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.029
Mmm. Yeah.

01:17.156 --> 01:19.749
By the way, we couldn't get the powder
room fixtures you wanted. What? Why?

01:19.835 --> 01:23.987
Well, they're 23%,
or $982, over the budget.

01:24.075 --> 01:28.034
Keeping in mind, that space
is only 12% of 1,462 square feet.

01:28.115 --> 01:30.025
Whenever I need to rein in Cam's spending,

01:30.114 --> 01:31.548
I employ something...

01:31.634 --> 01:33.705
that I like to call "the number dump."

01:33.794 --> 01:37.389
So... unless you wanna
cut 16%,

01:37.473 --> 01:40.910
or $1,764, from somewhere
in the flooring budget,

01:40.993 --> 01:42.666
we've gotta find
another 4% from-

01:42.752 --> 01:45.427
Yeah. As long as they're pretty,
it's fine. It's fine.

01:45.512 --> 01:48.185
Yesterday, I accidentally
said "eleventy-five."

01:48.951 --> 01:49.767
♪ Hey, hey ♪

01:57.071 --> 01:58.220
♪ Hey♪
♪

02:00.870 --> 02:04.547
So everybody knows how hard
I worked on that project. I mean-

02:04.670 --> 02:06.662
Whoa!

02:08.830 --> 02:11.830
- Hey, wait. What are you doing?
- Trying to put the sugar back in the thing.

02:11.869 --> 02:14.100
Well, just go get the broom.
I'll eat it for a dollar.

02:14.189 --> 02:15.747
What did I say about
eating things for money?

02:15.829 --> 02:17.627
Charge the most.
Then people will think you're worth it.

02:17.709 --> 02:19.188
That's right.
That's at least five.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.225
- Hey, he said a dollar.
- Broom.

02:21.348 --> 02:23.783
Hey, Dad, I can't find my scarf,

02:23.868 --> 02:25.347
and the closet light's burnt out.

02:25.428 --> 02:26.989
- So just change it.
- I can't reach it.

02:27.068 --> 02:29.299
Oh, if only there were some magical way...

02:29.388 --> 02:31.504
of getting up closer to the ceiling.

02:31.587 --> 02:33.500
Okay, now you just
sound like Dylan.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.418
- I'm saying get a stepstool.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:35.507 --> 02:37.499
One thing at a time, okay?

02:37.626 --> 02:39.822
What is happening?
I'm sweeping.

02:39.906 --> 02:42.216
No, you're not sweeping.
You're just spreading it all around.

02:42.306 --> 02:44.343
It's gonna cost more
if you want me to eat it now.

02:44.426 --> 02:46.224
That's when it hit me.

02:46.305 --> 02:49.025
My daughters know nothing
about home care and maintenance.

02:49.106 --> 02:50.744
I don't want 'em to be dependent.

02:50.826 --> 02:52.737
It's up to me to show them what a modern,

02:52.826 --> 02:55.135
self-sufficient woman looks like.

02:55.224 --> 02:56.977
¿ Qué tiene, mi muñequito?

02:57.065 --> 02:59.296
Que la Virgen me lo acompañe
y que los angelitos me lo cuiden-

02:59.425 --> 03:02.700
Careful. Keep that up, he'll have to hit
numero dos when he calls the D.M.V.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.183
By the time
he's old enough to call,

03:04.264 --> 03:06.095
it will be numero uno.

03:06.264 --> 03:08.016
Ay, there he is.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.295
Manny, why did you have
breakfast alone outside?

03:10.384 --> 03:12.693
I felt like eating breakfast alfresco.

03:12.782 --> 03:15.173
Does that mean he had his pants off?
Because if I can't, he can't.

03:15.263 --> 03:19.018
Jay, he's been eating outside
on his own all week.

03:19.103 --> 03:20.855
Do you think that he feels left out...

03:20.943 --> 03:22.934
because of all the attention
I give Joe?

03:23.021 --> 03:24.982
I've been wondering the same thing.
Tell you what.

03:25.021 --> 03:26.502
Why don't I have some father-son time...

03:26.581 --> 03:28.096
with Joe this afternoon...

03:28.181 --> 03:29.740
and give you
some time with Manny?

03:29.822 --> 03:31.300
Ay, that's so sweet.

03:31.381 --> 03:33.292
You can take Joe
to his baby class.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.020
I think he already knows
how to be a baby.

03:35.101 --> 03:37.934
I love you,
but I can't laugh at that again!

03:38.020 --> 03:41.218
Manny, how about
I pick you up after school,

03:41.299 --> 03:43.053
and we both have a special day?

03:43.140 --> 03:46.338
Well, I did talk to Jay about getting
some tickets for this reading.

03:46.459 --> 03:49.372
- What reading?
- Seriously? The stage reading of Moby-Dick?

03:49.458 --> 03:50.939
I told you about it last night.

03:51.018 --> 03:53.818
I have zero recollection of this.

03:53.898 --> 03:55.730
I knew I shouldn't have poured
you that second scotch.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.696
Sorry, buddy, but I already committed
to spending the afternoon with Joe...

03:57.778 --> 03:59.371
so you and your mom
could have more time together.

03:59.457 --> 04:01.051
Hey, maybe she can take you.

04:01.138 --> 04:02.617
- Can you, Mom?
- Of course, miamor.

04:02.698 --> 04:05.087
It's your special day.
We'll do whatever you want.

04:05.177 --> 04:07.454
Great. This is gonna be four hours
you'll never forget.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.731
Hey, buddy.

04:08.817 --> 04:10.649
Looks like
it's just the dos of us.

04:12.817 --> 04:15.968
Why do I feel that you did something shifty?
I have no idea.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.887
But I gotta say,
it's not your best quality.

04:18.015 --> 04:21.452
All right,
sweetie, you have a good day.

04:21.575 --> 04:24.410
Watch me play handball, Daddy.
Oh, okay.

04:24.496 --> 04:25.532
Next!

04:25.616 --> 04:29.130
That's Milo.
He beats everybody.

04:29.255 --> 04:31.291
Next loser!

04:31.375 --> 04:33.651
He's mean.
Yeah, I'm gettin' that.

04:35.495 --> 04:38.566
Next!

04:38.653 --> 04:41.293
- Another girl?
- Hey, sweetie? Sweetie?

04:41.374 --> 04:43.126
You're gonna do great, okay?

04:43.213 --> 04:46.205
If you say so.
Next!

04:46.292 --> 04:48.443
Uh, Milo? That-That was my fault.
I distracted her.

04:48.532 --> 04:50.046
So maybe she could
just go again?

04:50.133 --> 04:51.691
No do-overs. Next!

04:51.772 --> 04:54.526
Well, I'm next, and I would like
to give her my turn.

04:54.651 --> 04:56.848
No switcheroos.
Are you playing or not?

04:56.932 --> 04:59.605
- No.
- Chicken. Next.

04:59.692 --> 05:02.081
I hate bullies.
I've hated them my whole life.

05:02.172 --> 05:04.131
I hated them when
they were named Scott Dworkin...

05:04.210 --> 05:07.409
or Greg Pachenko
or Katie Greenwald.

05:08.890 --> 05:10.883
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna play.

05:10.970 --> 05:13.769
- But, Daddy, he's really good.
- Well, I'm really good too.

05:13.850 --> 05:15.488
- But it's a sport.
- I got this.

05:15.610 --> 05:18.408
You done talking? It's really
appropriate that we're at a school,

05:18.490 --> 05:20.526
because I'm about
to teach you a lesson.

05:24.008 --> 05:25.283
Next!

05:25.369 --> 05:26.883
All right.
Sorry, sweetheart.

05:26.968 --> 05:28.448
Here, I'll walk you to class.

05:28.568 --> 05:31.528
No, thank you, mister.
But-

05:34.567 --> 05:37.685
Mm-hmm.
What ya doin'?

05:39.287 --> 05:41.199
I think I have an idea.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.564
Okay. Every house
needs a wow factor, right?

05:48.687 --> 05:51.599
Hmm. What is the one thing
this backyard is missing?

05:51.726 --> 05:53.796
A qualified buyer.
Okay, don't be silly.

05:53.885 --> 05:56.924
No. A water feature
with a fire element.

05:57.085 --> 05:59.884
Oh, God, no. No, no, please.
Now just imagine...

06:00.004 --> 06:03.396
this entire back wall
cascading into a reservoir...

06:03.485 --> 06:05.795
that erupts into flames
on the quarter hour.

06:05.964 --> 06:09.162
How does that sound? Like
we need a white tiger.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.883
Maybe I'm being
a little ambitious.

06:10.963 --> 06:13.195
So let's just do a couple dancing
water fountains, call it a day.

06:13.284 --> 06:16.037
No, wait. Cam, Cam, Cam.
That's gonna still put us, like,

06:16.124 --> 06:17.842
$3,500 over
our landscape budget.

06:17.924 --> 06:20.437
Right now, we're forty-twelve percent higher
than I thought we'd be at this point,

06:20.562 --> 06:22.122
because Smitty added
that 8% surcharge.

06:22.202 --> 06:23.921
I'm sorry. Did you just say
forty-twelve percent?

06:24.043 --> 06:26.603
Mmm, no, I didn't. Yes, you did.
You do this all the time.

06:26.683 --> 06:29.321
You just throw numbers at me
to frighten and confuse me.

06:29.441 --> 06:33.401
And here I thought we were working so well
together, and you're just being manipulative.

06:33.482 --> 06:36.235
What about you, Cam? Pitching these
crazy, over-the-top ideas...

06:36.321 --> 06:38.438
just so you can slip in
what you really want.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.399
Oh, how dare you accuse me
of Trojan-horsing you?

06:41.520 --> 06:44.116
You have a name for it?
No. I mean-

06:44.241 --> 06:47.550
You know what? I will not stand here
and be accused by the likes of you.

06:47.639 --> 06:50.108
And if there was a door here, missy,
I would slam it in your face.

06:50.199 --> 06:53.954
Oh-ho! I thought we weren't
flaming till the quarter hour!

06:57.119 --> 06:58.871
Gloria and Manny
left me alone with Joe,

06:58.959 --> 07:01.190
and it was great...
for about 20 minutes.

07:01.318 --> 07:03.993
Then the little
bugger turned on me.

07:04.078 --> 07:07.593
I tried everything to calm him down-
Bouncing. Bottle.

07:07.678 --> 07:11.387
Brightly colored objects.
Bigger bottle.

07:11.478 --> 07:13.389
So I did the old
"put him in the car" trick.

07:13.478 --> 07:15.434
But I could still hear him out there.
I'm just kidding.

07:15.516 --> 07:17.429
I drove him to his little class,

07:17.516 --> 07:19.713
but he dozed off
right before we got there.

07:19.797 --> 07:21.948
Or he took a page
from the Jay Pritchett playbook-

07:22.076 --> 07:26.433
saw the crap he was in for
and pretended to be asleep.

07:26.555 --> 07:28.228
Mr. Pritchett?
Yeah.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.353
Rachel Lissy.
Claire's friend from high school. Remember?

07:31.435 --> 07:34.506
How could I forget? You knocked
down my mailbox with your K-car.

07:34.634 --> 07:36.353
Again, I apologize.

07:36.475 --> 07:38.273
How you doin'?
Couldn't be better.

07:38.355 --> 07:41.268
I've been married for 15 years.
Two great boys over there.

07:41.355 --> 07:45.267
Cooper!
Unhand your brother!

07:45.354 --> 07:48.233
I'm taking them
to the James Bond movie,

07:48.313 --> 07:51.147
and they don't want me
to sit with them.

07:51.234 --> 07:53.463
I miss babies.

07:53.552 --> 07:54.752
Oh, they're a lot of fun, huh?

07:54.872 --> 07:56.829
So nice to see you.
Nice seeing you.

07:57.752 --> 07:59.266
Great kids.

07:59.353 --> 08:03.823
Ugh! No, you're not!

08:03.912 --> 08:06.028
Joe, I found a better way
for us to bond.

08:07.592 --> 08:09.662
James Bond.

08:09.751 --> 08:12.663
My dad taught me
everything there is to know...

08:12.750 --> 08:14.264
about maintaining a home,

08:14.351 --> 08:16.546
and today
that tradition continues.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.986
Voilà!
Light bulb changed.

08:19.070 --> 08:22.619
Hey, I have an idea.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.223
Let's get to know
the house, huh?

08:24.309 --> 08:27.109
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's lock him in.

08:27.189 --> 08:31.149
Okay. Let's start with this baby right here.
What are we lookin' at, huh?

08:31.229 --> 08:33.184
Photosynthesis.

08:35.589 --> 08:37.466
In a sense, yeah.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.582
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.977
Uh, photosynthesis
converts carbon dioxide...

08:41.068 --> 08:42.582
into food for plants.

08:42.667 --> 08:46.627
This water heater
converts cold water into hot.

08:46.708 --> 08:48.698
What converts
this conversation into over?

08:48.786 --> 08:50.300
Girls, you need
to learn these things.

08:50.386 --> 08:51.980
You might find yourselves
living alone at some point.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.547
Oh.

08:54.707 --> 08:56.221
I long for the day.

08:56.307 --> 08:58.537
Okay, we're just gonna start
with something really basic. All right?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.777
I am turning
the pilot light off.

09:00.865 --> 09:02.346
These things
go out occasionally.

09:02.426 --> 09:04.178
- Why?
- I don't know. No one knows.

09:04.265 --> 09:05.779
Let's just say gremlins do it.

09:05.865 --> 09:07.856
But if it happens to you,
what do you do?

09:07.945 --> 09:09.459
- Call a guy.
- Or a girl.

09:09.545 --> 09:11.901
Oh, my God, we're literally in a
closet, and you just said that.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.624
Focus.
You don't call anyone.

09:13.705 --> 09:16.696
To relight the pilot,
turn the valve to "Pilot,"

09:16.783 --> 09:21.062
you press it down to begin the
flow of gas, wait a few seconds-

09:21.184 --> 09:24.097
Where you guys from originally?

09:24.184 --> 09:27.061
And you just press the igniter.
There you go.

09:27.183 --> 09:29.742
That's odd.
Why isn't that working?

09:29.823 --> 09:33.612
Oh, I got it. Why don't we just fill
it up with hot water from the tap?

09:33.742 --> 09:36.860
Found another
light that's out.

09:36.942 --> 09:39.775
Claire and I were at a stalemate
on the water feature.

09:39.861 --> 09:44.491
So I brought in an experienced
professional to help break the tie.

09:44.620 --> 09:46.499
Pam also happens
to be a friend...

09:46.620 --> 09:49.010
and a fellow gay parent
at Lily's school.

09:49.101 --> 09:52.332
Am I trying to stack the deck
against Claire here?

09:52.461 --> 09:55.611
No. I would never be so...

09:55.700 --> 09:57.975
genius.

10:00.220 --> 10:02.609
- Hi.
- Oh. Oh, Claire, this is Pam.

10:02.699 --> 10:03.655
Pam, Claire.
Hey.

10:03.778 --> 10:05.372
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
You too.

10:05.459 --> 10:06.858
Pam is a licensed contractor.

10:06.978 --> 10:08.493
Done a lot of houses. Uh-huh?

10:08.579 --> 10:11.013
I thought it'd be nice to bring in
a third party that's objective...

10:11.099 --> 10:12.531
to help settle
the fountain dispute.

10:12.617 --> 10:15.053
Oh. Objective. Right.

10:15.137 --> 10:16.935
Well, my son does
go to school with Lily,

10:17.017 --> 10:18.896
but believe me, that is not
gonna sway my decision...

10:19.017 --> 10:22.010
any more than the fact that
you are beautiful. Hmm?

10:22.097 --> 10:23.770
Thank you. You are too.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.133
Thank you.
Let me grab your cans.

10:26.217 --> 10:29.096
Your paint cans. There you go.

10:29.177 --> 10:31.053
So-

10:37.536 --> 10:39.049
Hey, what's the matter, Joe?

10:39.135 --> 10:42.845
Hey, that's a boy.
That's a boy.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.689
Come on.
Come here. There you go.

10:45.774 --> 10:48.290
There you are.
There you go. There you go.

10:50.133 --> 10:52.329
You know, I'm happy to take him
outside until he stops crying.

10:52.454 --> 10:54.046
No, I wouldn't want you to miss this.
It's fine.

10:54.174 --> 10:57.212
Once Daniel Craig put his shirt back
on, I lost interest. Are you sure?

10:57.294 --> 10:58.693
Absolutely.
Okay.

10:58.852 --> 11:00.969
Here. Just go ahead.
That-a-boy. Okay.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.891
That-a-boy. Thank you very much.
I'll be right outside.

11:03.972 --> 11:05.406
Okay. Shh!

11:05.492 --> 11:07.006
You shush, Nathan!

11:09.812 --> 11:11.212
Stupid thing!

11:11.332 --> 11:13.932
Dad, we've been standing here forever.
Can't we just call the guy?

11:14.011 --> 11:15.809
No. There is no guy.
I'm the guy.

11:15.891 --> 11:19.804
Here's what I need you to do. Run to the
hardware store, get me a T6 Torx screwdriver.

11:19.931 --> 11:21.411
What?
Just ask the guy.

11:21.531 --> 11:23.567
I thought there was no guy.
There is one there!

11:23.691 --> 11:24.807
Could be a girl.
Yeah?

11:24.890 --> 11:26.643
Just go!

11:26.729 --> 11:28.642
I didn't need
a Torx screwdriver.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.767
I've always wanted one though.

11:30.849 --> 11:33.968
But I needed them out of the house,
so I could...

11:34.050 --> 11:35.530
call a guy.

11:35.609 --> 11:37.760
Dad, help me.

11:37.888 --> 11:39.448
Are we gonna do
that thing again...

11:39.529 --> 11:42.566
where you try on different outfits
like in Pretty Woman?

11:44.049 --> 11:45.562
Hey.

11:45.688 --> 11:47.289
Saw you sinkin'
some J's back there, huh?

11:47.367 --> 11:49.723
Box-and-one. Cover two.

11:49.847 --> 11:52.841
Sh-Shaq-a-hack? Am I right?
Not even close.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.879
What's up?
Well, word has it...

11:54.966 --> 11:57.083
that you were a pretty good
handball player back in the day.

11:57.167 --> 12:00.205
Yeah. And Neil Armstrong
was a pretty good trumpet player.

12:00.327 --> 12:03.125
I see you spent a lot more time on the
court than you did in the classroom,

12:03.207 --> 12:04.686
so clearly I've come
to the right place.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.279
I need you to teach me
everything you know.

12:06.365 --> 12:07.959
How come it's so important?

12:08.046 --> 12:11.322
There's this kid, and he's been kind of
bullying Lily and all of her friends.

12:11.406 --> 12:15.035
And I tried to teach him. I tried to put
him in his place on the handball court.

12:15.124 --> 12:16.638
And I lost.

12:16.724 --> 12:19.035
And I-I could just see the
disappointment in Lily's eyes.

12:19.124 --> 12:20.718
Like there's any emotion
in those eyes.

12:20.844 --> 12:22.881
Are you gonna help me or not?

12:22.963 --> 12:24.000
Okay.
Yes!

12:24.084 --> 12:26.723
But I need you to give it 105%.

12:26.843 --> 12:30.200
Ah, no. It's 110%, buddy.
That's impossible.

12:30.284 --> 12:32.923
Yes. I think the fountain's
a little pricey.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.039
But you know what? It's gonna
more than make up for itself...

12:35.122 --> 12:38.752
when a family comes in here and falls
head over heels in love with this home.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.596
Okay, that's a valid point.
It is a bit of an empty space out there.

12:41.721 --> 12:44.032
Thank you. Well, I mean, I
see what you're saying.

12:44.121 --> 12:45.841
Sorry. It's hot in here, right?

12:45.922 --> 12:50.633
Well, that happens to women
of a certain age, like with my mom.

12:50.721 --> 12:52.996
Are you kidding?
What are you, like, 35?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.351
What are you, like,
an angel sent from heaven?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.831
I see what you're saying.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.599
I just feel that we might be
pricing ourselves out of the market.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.716
If a family wants to come in here...

13:02.839 --> 13:07.073
and build themselves a fountain,
they can do so themselves.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.753
That's true.

13:08.839 --> 13:10.670
Um, okay, well, you know, Pam,

13:10.799 --> 13:14.554
um, there are lots of families like...
ours-Mm-hmm.

13:14.638 --> 13:17.107
Moving to this neighborhood
for the schools.

13:17.199 --> 13:20.395
P.S. Saw Connor's art project.
Gorgeous.

13:20.477 --> 13:23.789
Talent runs in the family.

13:23.877 --> 13:27.314
Anyway, I'm just saying
I think a family would respond...

13:27.398 --> 13:30.434
to having a little drama
in the backyard.

13:30.517 --> 13:34.192
I think Pam's made it pretty clear
what she likes. Am I right?

13:34.277 --> 13:36.075
Well-

13:36.157 --> 13:37.749
Oh, no.

13:37.875 --> 13:41.551
Now my shirt is all see-through.
Yeah. And so are you.

13:41.635 --> 13:43.672
Please tell me
you are not falling for this.

13:43.755 --> 13:47.829
I'm not, but I am enjoying this little
show tremendously, so thank you.

13:47.915 --> 13:49.474
Mmm.
Yeah.

13:49.555 --> 13:53.070
As for my professional opinion
on the fountain, don't do it.

13:53.155 --> 13:56.305
I mean, if you were gonna
live here yourself, I'd say go for it.

13:56.394 --> 13:58.351
But it's too expensive
for a flip.

13:58.434 --> 14:00.346
Yeah. Yeah.
All right.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.032
Thank you.

14:02.113 --> 14:03.593
Cam?
Fine.

14:03.674 --> 14:05.550
Lesbians!

14:06.992 --> 14:09.792
I can't believe I just went
garter shopping with my son.

14:09.872 --> 14:12.547
When you find a better way
to keep my socks up, let me know.

14:12.632 --> 14:14.192
Hey, as long as we're in the mall,

14:14.273 --> 14:16.264
you wanna stop in the baby class
and see Jay and Joe?

14:16.351 --> 14:18.344
No. They need this time
to make a connection.

14:18.432 --> 14:19.912
It's not like mother and son-

14:20.032 --> 14:21.864
that the bond is naturally strong.

14:21.991 --> 14:25.109
Hey, isn't that Joe over there?

14:25.191 --> 14:28.070
Ay, no, that's some weird baby.

14:28.151 --> 14:29.869
He's not perfect
like my little Joe.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.863
But he's got the same blanket.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.190
Gloria. What are you doing here?

14:39.310 --> 14:41.699
Ow. You gave our
baby to a stranger?

14:41.790 --> 14:43.269
Not a stranger.
She's Claire's friend.

14:43.309 --> 14:44.982
Shh. Shut up, Nathan.

14:45.069 --> 14:46.900
Gloria.

14:50.069 --> 14:52.308
The gas is on, Dad. I can see
the spark from the igniter.

14:52.347 --> 14:53.463
I don't know what it is.

14:53.548 --> 14:55.505
- That's your thermocouple.
- Oh.

14:55.587 --> 14:58.422
You get a little sediment in there
or some rust, and you're done for.

14:58.508 --> 15:01.467
The thermocouple! Of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

15:01.547 --> 15:03.663
Thanks, Dad. I-I shouldn't be
buggin' you with this stuff.

15:03.746 --> 15:05.624
Are you kiddin' me?
I love to help.

15:05.706 --> 15:07.619
Makes me feel
like you still need me.

15:07.706 --> 15:10.267
Of course I need you. You're the
best when it comes to this.

15:10.346 --> 15:12.815
- Anything else you need fixin'?
- Yeah, actually,

15:12.906 --> 15:16.023
I've been havin' a little trouble
with my thumb.

15:16.105 --> 15:17.778
Oh, the old thumb.
That's simple.

15:17.865 --> 15:20.699
Just push it back in
and make that popping sound.

15:22.344 --> 15:24.223
- Oh, yeah, you're right.
- There you go.

15:26.224 --> 15:28.864
Hey, make sure you tell Claire
how pretty she looks tonight.

15:28.944 --> 15:31.379
- A woman needs to hear that.
- You do the same with Mom.

15:31.463 --> 15:34.376
No, your mom's a little tired
of hearing how pretty Claire is.

15:34.463 --> 15:36.774
Good one!

15:36.863 --> 15:39.253
- All right. Love you.
- Love you too.

15:39.783 --> 15:41.183
Dad, we're home.

15:41.263 --> 15:42.538
Hey.

15:42.622 --> 15:45.980
That was the least fun
I have ever had shopping, ever.

15:46.063 --> 15:47.337
Here.

15:47.423 --> 15:51.336
Honey, that's a torque wrench,
not a Torx screwdriver.

15:51.422 --> 15:53.014
Okay, you're just screaming now.

15:53.101 --> 15:55.491
Can't you just go get it?
You're the best at this stuff.

15:55.581 --> 15:57.220
Yeah, plus the car
is doing something funny,

15:57.302 --> 15:59.657
and there's a light on the dashboard
that looks like a little genie lamp.

15:59.740 --> 16:03.017
My kids are helpless,
but maybe that's okay.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.057
Because years from now,
when they have their own houses,

16:05.141 --> 16:06.859
they'll call me
on their hologram phones and say,

16:06.939 --> 16:09.090
"Help me, Dad.
You're my only hope."

16:09.180 --> 16:11.900
And I'll be the happiest father
in Sector 7.

16:11.979 --> 16:14.619
Or Sector 12,
if we're doing really well.

16:14.699 --> 16:16.690
I don't know
why your mom's so mad.

16:16.779 --> 16:19.977
Maybe it has something to do with giving
your son away to a complete stranger.

16:20.098 --> 16:23.092
You're next. And what were you two
doing in the mall anyway?

16:23.218 --> 16:25.259
I thought you were seeing Moby-Dick.
It was sold out.

16:25.299 --> 16:27.210
Maybe that's how you
can make it up to her.

16:27.337 --> 16:30.297
Take me to the Moby-Dick
reading tomorrow. Nice try.

16:30.378 --> 16:31.891
Doing something selfless
for her other son...

16:31.977 --> 16:33.617
could make up for
your monumental blunder.

16:33.658 --> 16:36.411
Maybe flowers or jewelry. I like to throw
money at the problem.

16:36.497 --> 16:39.091
Hello, pretty lady.
What do you wanna do for dinner?

16:39.177 --> 16:41.736
How about we exchange the baby
for a cheese pizza?

16:41.856 --> 16:44.212
Is this about today?
I'll call for those tickets.

16:44.296 --> 16:47.493
You were supposed to spend
quality time with the baby.

16:47.575 --> 16:50.410
Joe was asleep. He didn't even
know he missed the puppet show.

16:50.536 --> 16:52.448
It was the baby class!
Okay, call it what you want.

16:52.536 --> 16:54.447
I saw a hippie
with a frog on his hand.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.766
And for your information, I'm takin'
Manny to that reading tomorrow.

16:57.854 --> 16:59.652
Now you're just trying
to dig yourself out of a hole...

16:59.734 --> 17:02.250
because you know
that you were caught in a lie.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.012
So here's something-
Not now, Manny.

17:04.133 --> 17:05.692
Oh, let him talk.
I called the theater,

17:05.773 --> 17:07.925
and they have tons of tickets
for tomorrow's show.

17:08.013 --> 17:09.733
And it turns out today's show
wasn't sold out either.

17:09.893 --> 17:11.327
Ay, Manny, not now.
Let him talk.

17:11.413 --> 17:12.773
Mom, why'd you say
it was sold out?

17:12.852 --> 17:14.172
Yeah. Why'd you say
it was sold out?

17:14.252 --> 17:17.087
It was a mistake.
This is not my first language.

17:17.172 --> 17:19.404
I don't understand English
very goodly.

17:19.492 --> 17:22.608
Don't play that card. You didn't
want to go any more than I did.

17:22.692 --> 17:26.481
Fine. I lied.
But I earned that lie.

17:26.570 --> 17:28.449
Ay, Manny, I am so sorry.

17:28.531 --> 17:33.889
But you know that I am always trying to do
everything for everybody in this family.

17:33.971 --> 17:38.011
But you.
You only do what's good for you.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.923
Let me tell you something,
Jay Pritchett.

17:40.011 --> 17:44.800
When it comes to raising kids,
you get what you give.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.766
Well, you rattled that off
pretty goodly.

17:49.848 --> 17:53.047
You don't have to do this, Daddy.

17:53.128 --> 17:55.519
I know, but Daddy
really wants to do this. Okay?

17:55.608 --> 17:58.521
No, no, no. What do you think you're doing, Sadie?
No cutsies. Come on.

17:58.608 --> 18:00.884
- Next.
- Hello, Milo.

18:00.968 --> 18:03.038
Hello, one of Lily's dads.

18:03.127 --> 18:07.519
Let's make this interesting.
If I win, the new rule is this.

18:07.607 --> 18:09.518
No player can play
more than three times in a row...

18:09.606 --> 18:12.007
without getting back in line
and letting the other kids play.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.516
What if I win?
Then I'll give you $20,000.

18:14.646 --> 18:16.365
You're on.
All right. Let's do this.

18:19.645 --> 18:21.796
Yes! Whoo!

18:21.885 --> 18:23.400
One point for me.

18:23.486 --> 18:24.966
One point for me.
That's right.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.639
Milo, the wall's over here.

18:27.725 --> 18:30.603
Nah, nah. Doesn't count.
It was out!

18:30.685 --> 18:32.756
Aah! Little too
high for you, huh?

18:32.884 --> 18:35.604
Three bounces to the wall
makes you a loser

18:35.685 --> 18:37.515
Makes you a loser

18:37.603 --> 18:40.516
Final point.
I get this, I win.

18:40.603 --> 18:42.640
Oh, sweet lord Jesus.

18:43.964 --> 18:46.273
Whoo! Yes!

18:46.362 --> 18:47.513
Yes! Winner!

18:47.602 --> 18:49.754
Champion! Champion!

18:49.842 --> 18:52.152
Cam's gonna be doing
drop-offs for a while.

18:52.243 --> 18:55.041
We got a letter.

18:55.121 --> 18:58.956
I'm sure you're both wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

18:59.042 --> 19:02.638
I now present to you...
the wow factor.

19:03.401 --> 19:04.960
Cam.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.910
I cannot believe
that you went rogue.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.271
Uncool. I am
with Claire on this.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.192
You'll soon see why.

19:14.280 --> 19:18.559
Prepare your senses
for dancing waters.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.119
Wow.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.519
Factor.

19:23.598 --> 19:25.317
Now imagine
a prospective buyer...

19:25.398 --> 19:27.709
so entranced
by the aqua ballet,

19:27.798 --> 19:30.871
they're compelled instantly
to make a rich offer.

19:30.959 --> 19:34.634
I've even stocked the pools
with fish of gold.

19:34.718 --> 19:36.198
They're just goldfish,

19:36.278 --> 19:38.394
but they're-
they're right here.

19:40.438 --> 19:43.270
This is-This is pretty impressive, Cam.
What did you spend?

19:43.356 --> 19:45.825
Quite a bit, actually.
But I don't wanna get into that.

19:45.917 --> 19:49.035
Let me turn this up
to eleventy-five.

19:51.476 --> 19:53.626
Wow. Factor.

19:55.115 --> 19:58.267
Hey, Cam, are fish of gold
supposed to swim backwards like that?

19:58.355 --> 20:00.074
No, not to my knowledge, no.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.909
Yeah, it's kind of like they're all sort
of gathering towards that thing. Like-

20:03.035 --> 20:04.264
Oh, no!
Oh, my God!

20:04.354 --> 20:06.471
They're getting sucked out!

20:06.554 --> 20:08.069
You're killing them! You murderer!

20:08.154 --> 20:09.951
Claire! Unplug it!

20:10.034 --> 20:12.754
That's half a fish!
That's half a fish!

20:12.833 --> 20:14.666
"There are certain
queer times and occasions...

20:14.754 --> 20:16.824
in this strange,
mixed affair we call life...

20:16.914 --> 20:20.827
when a man takes this whole universe
for a vast practical joke"-

20:22.792 --> 20:25.183
"Though the wit thereof
he but dimly discerns"-

20:25.273 --> 20:26.792
Tick-tick-tick-
tick-tick-tick-tick

20:26.832 --> 20:28.312
Boom, boom, goes
the dynamite

20:28.392 --> 20:29.984
Boom, boom, goes
the dynamite

20:30.111 --> 20:35.061
"and more than suspects that the joke
is at nobody's expense but his own."

20:43.870 --> 20:46.261
All right. Close your eyes. Why?

20:46.390 --> 20:47.824
Just trust me.
Okay.

20:47.950 --> 20:50.988
Ow! Never close your
eyes on the court!

20:51.109 --> 20:52.988
But you told me-
Don't let me get in your head!

20:53.069 --> 20:55.379
Pop 'em all before
they hit the ground! Go!

20:56.509 --> 20:58.022
I don't really understand how-

20:58.108 --> 21:00.339
Make a fist
with your thumb on the side.

21:00.429 --> 21:03.705
Now bring your thumb to the front.
Okay, now do it again.

21:03.788 --> 21:05.780
Ha! You just spelled "ass"
in sign language.

21:07.188 --> 21:10.181
Okay. Close your eyes.

21:10.307 --> 21:12.663
It's okay. We're off the court.

21:12.748 --> 21:15.024
You're never off the court!
