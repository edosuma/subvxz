Bring me Shandaweily.

01:00:47.812 --> 01:00:48.812
Sir.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:55.119
And release the crazy one.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:57.854
Yes sir.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:07.064
EZZAT: He's no better than
the ones who died, Youssef.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.669
You don't know
what he meant to me.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.605
He wasn't like your
brother, he was your brother.

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.275
But he didn't die because of us.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.311
You of all people
should know how I feel.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:24.749
All I feel and know
right now is one thing.

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:27.151
We're at war.

the dead but by the living.

Hey sir, who's that?

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:44.935
Ezzat Abd Rabbu El-Wahsh,
a military officer.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.371
In the battle of
Alamein, his battalion

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:50.040
got orders to
attack the Germans.

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:53.476
He decided that
it wasn't our war

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:55.244
and gave orders to retreat.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:57.280
He was relieved of duty
and sentenced to death

01:01:57.281 --> 01:01:58.849
by the British governor.

01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:01.717
He escaped and formed a gang

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.754
to kill and slaughter
English soldiers.

01:02:04.755 --> 01:02:06.389
You mean the guerrillas?

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.224
He called them that.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.260
Ezzat was an old friend
of Youssef's dad.

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:13.196
In a way you could say
he was raised by him

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:15.099
more than his own father.

Step on it, man, we're late.

01:02:34.819 --> 01:02:39.824
Your officer killed a
number of British soldiers

01:02:40.925 --> 01:02:43.860
and is sheltering
mutineers and murderers.

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:45.929

going to announce

surround the station

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.708
along with an
Egyptian police force.

01:03:01.045 --> 01:03:02.579
You want Egyptian policemen

01:03:03.848 --> 01:03:05.414
to kill other
Egyptian policemen?

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.217
No, I want your
Egyptian policemen

01:03:08.218 --> 01:03:10.720
to kill a bunch of
mutineers and criminals.

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:12.989
My God!

If your men are so strong
and you have the station

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.896
surrounded with those
arms and military power,

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:21.797
why don't you just attack
and be done with it?

If two English officers
weren't in their custody,

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:26.871
I'd do it.

Any action against that officer

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.353
could turn him into
a national hero.

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:47.290
The man is well-loved
throughout Alexandria.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:50.227
Your job is not to
make him well-loved.

we've just received an
urgent news bulletin.

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:31.834
An Egyptian officer,
Youssef Amin El-Masry,

01:04:31.835 --> 01:04:35.371
has mutinied against
his superiors,

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:39.108
and against the orders of the
British governor in Egypt,

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:43.713
putting his life and the lives
of other civilians in danger,

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:48.084
due to his sheltering
a group of criminals

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:53.090
and outlaws alike and thinking
that he is above the law.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:59.362
This traitorous officer, has
tricked the policemen with him

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:03.266
into carrying out his
orders and mutinous desires,

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:05.801
to satisfy his thirst for blood.

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:08.238
He's ordered them
to follow his plan

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:13.776
to murder civilians and
military personnel alike,

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:18.581

as human shields.

of officer Youssef El-Masry

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:30.193
in a time of war.

01:05:30.194 --> 01:05:32.795
According to military rulings,

01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:35.731
the punishment for mutiny
and treason being faced

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:39.369
by the officer is
death by firing squad,

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:42.739
after being stripped
of his ranks.

all civilians and
military personnel

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:53.182
against dealing with
the treasonous officer,

A promotion or a medal?

01:45:57.351 --> 01:45:59.786

to be a national hero
