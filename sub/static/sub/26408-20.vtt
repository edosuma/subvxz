We have HVT.

Fear".

00:15.400 --> 00:17.186

00:17.230 --> 00:18.185
If you don't slay it,

00:18.230 --> 00:19.128
you will not make it

00:19.190 --> 00:20.669
through OCS.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.268
I used my faith as a weapon.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.878
I denied a man
his last rites

00:23.930 --> 00:26.364
to get what I needed from
him. I'm paying for it.

00:26.410 --> 00:28.275

Your psychological issues

00:37.120 --> 00:39.509

are not psychological.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.766
They're physiological.

00:40.820 --> 00:42.378
I don't have the authority

00:42.430 --> 00:43.852
to authorize
an MRI,

MANDY:
Two days ago,
a hotel was bombed in Phuket.

01:18.940 --> 01:21.898
11 Westerners were killed.
22 more were injured.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.077
It was similar
to the event in Manila

01:24.120 --> 01:27.419
that severely wounded one of
Bravo and killed 15 civilians.

01:27.470 --> 01:29.290
Somebody's targeting Westerners.

01:29.350 --> 01:33.127
We traced the bombing in Phuket
to the Asian Liberation Army.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.511
ALA?Mm-hmm.

01:34.570 --> 01:36.174
They're throwback Commies.

01:36.220 --> 01:38.176
Haven't been militant
In 30 years.

01:38.220 --> 01:40.529
That's why I'm worried.

01:40.570 --> 01:43.869
An element of the nonviolent
New ReSIstance Force

01:43.920 --> 01:45.797
carried out the bombing
in Manila.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.274
A formerly peaceful
Islamic group

01:48.320 --> 01:51.187
bombed a mining interest
in Vietnam.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.141
The ALA's attack in Phuket fits into a pattern.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.360
It's not a coincidence.

01:55.410 --> 01:57.230
The tactics are alike,

01:57.290 --> 01:59.235
and they're not local.
They're imported.

01:59.290 --> 02:02.327
Someone is radicalizing
anti-Western groups

02:02.380 --> 02:03.768
in Southeast Asia.

02:03.810 --> 02:05.209
Why?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.070
To destabilize
the region.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.850
Make it easier to recruit,
set up shop here.

02:09.910 --> 02:11.730
Do you know who?

02:11.780 --> 02:14.169
I suspect, but I can't say yet.

02:14.220 --> 02:15.949
Ray, you seeing this?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.956
Ain't blind.
But by the time we flank 'em,

02:18.000 --> 02:19.433
they'll have that truck loaded
and gone.

You know, the whole part
of a surprise attack

02:24.100 --> 02:25.431
is the surprise.

02:25.490 --> 02:28.095
We kind of lose that
when we go straight in.

02:28.140 --> 02:30.096
Bravo 2,

02:30.150 --> 02:31.924
take Full Metal to the right.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.129
The plan is a stealth op.

I'm sorry. I...

stupid right now.

You know nothing of God.

You're a whore.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.581
You were there,
near the bar in Manila,

09:58.640 --> 09:59.937
when the bomb went off.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.117
You were in Phuket,
when the hotel was bombed.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.946
And you were
on the loading docks,

10:03.990 --> 10:07.551
picking up more weapons
for another attack.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.036

gonna be free agaIn.

where you die--

10:15.350 --> 10:17.124

10:17.180 --> 10:19.080
or a jail in the States,

the sun once a day.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.139
You can help yourself.

It's Pakistan.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.308

And you are gonna tell us
exactly where.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.019
I can promise you that.

11:22.070 --> 11:23.321
You're wrong.

11:23.370 --> 11:26.157
Yasin Khan
is not like bin Laden.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.158
He's ten times the man,
ten times the leader.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.338
And he will do to your country
ten times the damage.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.336
No, he won't.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.382
Because we're gonna kill him.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.085
Hey, Emma. Finally,
I caught you. Hello.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.744
Sorry, Dad. Been busy.

11:49.790 --> 11:51.838
Was out all day, too.
Naima took me shopping.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.006
That's great. How is she?

11:53.060 --> 11:54.357
Good.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.140
I think she's worried
about Uncle Ray.

11:56.190 --> 11:57.487
Why's that?

11:57.540 --> 11:59.440
Guess they haven't spoken
in weeks.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.627
She said you guys
have been off-grid.

12:01.670 --> 12:02.978
But you've called us.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.976
I didn't say anything.

12:05.020 --> 12:07.022
No, you-you were
right not to. I...

12:07.070 --> 12:10.369
Did you get my e-mail?
About a meal plan and books?

12:10.420 --> 12:11.762
Vanessa says it's cheaper
to buy...Stop. Whoa, whoa.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.766
Just slow down, okay?
How's Mikey?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.208
He's fine, Dad.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.161
Mikey wants to go away
to hockey school next year.

12:17.210 --> 12:19.030
Hockey... Hockey school?

12:19.080 --> 12:21.162
Yes. It's a boarding school
where they play hockey.

12:21.210 --> 12:23.428
I know what that is. How am I
supposed to pay for that?

12:23.480 --> 12:24.959
And I also need a meal plan
and books.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.388
Emma, hold on, okay?

12:26.440 --> 12:28.431
I will check my e-mail
when I can.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.959
I-I called to talk to you.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.261
You haven't even looked?

12:31.310 --> 12:32.868
If the payment's late...

12:32.920 --> 12:34.171
Look, it's not gonna be late.

12:34.230 --> 12:35.743
Says the man who refuses to deal

12:35.790 --> 12:37.576
with anything
regarding my future.I'm not.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.611
Look, can we just talk
about something else here?No, Dad.

12:39.670 --> 12:40.921
We can't, because you keep
making this the thing

12:40.970 --> 12:42.312
we always have to talk about

12:42.370 --> 12:44.179
by not dealing with it. Goodbye.Em-Emma, st...

12:44.240 --> 12:46.322
Great.

12:46.370 --> 12:47.712
Unbelievable, man.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.751
Kidding me.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.296
One MRI?

13:01.340 --> 13:03.774
One MRI. That's all
his life was worth?

13:03.820 --> 13:05.515
That MRI
that you wouldn't authorize.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.608
You-you knew what was wrong
with him, and you wouldn't help.

13:07.650 --> 13:08.901
I couldn't help him.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.518
I'm sorry.You're sorry?

13:10.570 --> 13:12.788
He shot himself,
and you're sorry?

13:14.880 --> 13:17.963
You could have ordered that MRI.

13:18.010 --> 13:20.399
No, I couldn't.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.004
Look, I've tried that before,

13:23.060 --> 13:24.357
and it just gets
a patient's hopes up

13:24.410 --> 13:25.832
until they're flatly denied.

13:25.890 --> 13:27.926
My hands were tied.

13:27.980 --> 13:30.141
The VA system serves
nine million veterans.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.974
Yeah, serves them.
You make them sit here

13:32.020 --> 13:33.282
and wait in line for hours.

13:33.330 --> 13:34.843
Days. And then you
just, you do nothing,

13:34.900 --> 13:37.027
but you shove pills in them.Look, we do all we can.

13:37.070 --> 13:39.197
You don't do enough!I know that!

13:39.250 --> 13:42.026
Look, I try my best.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.638
I do my best.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.851
I work long hours here.

13:45.910 --> 13:48.378
But you're right.

13:48.430 --> 13:50.512
Your friend deserved better.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.471
Heck, every vet
deserves better.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.431
But no one seems to care.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.214
Once we're out, we just...

13:57.270 --> 13:59.215
We don't matter anymore.
That's what you're saying.

13:59.270 --> 14:03.445
Nine million patients
that need care.

14:03.490 --> 14:05.879
Run by the same
government stooges

14:05.930 --> 14:07.739
that can't graduate
50% of high school kids

14:07.800 --> 14:09.449
or get us out of endless wars.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.792
[laughs]: And we expect them
to make this work?

14:12.850 --> 14:15.842
This place
might as well be the DMV.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.408
Look”.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.894
traumatic brain injuries
go unreported.

14:22.940 --> 14:25.818
You want to help?
You want to make a difference?

14:25.860 --> 14:29.853
Start there inside the military.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.859
Make that your mission now.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.921
[clears throat]

14:50.970 --> 14:52.790
Vodka soda, please.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.796
Well, look at that.
[chuckles]

14:54.850 --> 14:57.102
Fancy seeing you here.

14:57.150 --> 14:59.675
We're on an island the
SIze of a parkIng lot.

15:01.370 --> 15:03.247
Not many other places to be.

15:03.290 --> 15:06.191
Yeah, I think
that's working out for me.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.684
Uh...

15:08.730 --> 15:11.119
Thanks.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.819
You look tired.

15:12.860 --> 15:14.999
Yeah.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.769
Long day.

15:16.820 --> 15:19.436
Difficult patient.Patient. Well, I thought

15:19.480 --> 15:21.516
that you weren't supposed
to talk about your patients

15:21.570 --> 15:24.698
with the whole
patient confidentiality thing.

15:24.740 --> 15:29.131
Well, I'm not exactly revealing
anything confidential.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.966
Just saying I had a bad day.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.796
All right.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.569
How about you?

15:35.630 --> 15:36.961
My day?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.318
Uh, just like yesterday.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.065
The day before that

15:41.110 --> 15:43.578
and the day before that
and the day before that.

15:43.630 --> 15:45.450
You know, you're not
really telling me much.

15:45.500 --> 15:50.062
You realize that, right?What exactly
would you want me to say?

15:50.120 --> 15:52.418
Just how your day was.

15:52.470 --> 15:55.507
Is that too much to ask?

15:55.560 --> 15:58.120
I didn't come here for this.

15:58.170 --> 15:59.899
What?

15:59.950 --> 16:01.736
It's just a conversation.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.168
It's not a conversation.
You're turnIng It

16:03.220 --> 16:05.120
into an argument,
it sounds like.

16:05.180 --> 16:06.863
That's odd, because
I was just...

16:06.920 --> 16:09.002
asking how your day was,

16:09.050 --> 16:10.915
and you don't really
want to talk about it,

16:10.970 --> 16:13.222
or much anything
else, so...

16:13.270 --> 16:15.875
You're psychoanalyzing me.

16:15.930 --> 16:17.443
You're trying to root
through my brain

16:17.490 --> 16:19.879
and find something
that is a problem

16:19.930 --> 16:21.443
that really isn't a problem,

16:21.500 --> 16:22.797
and then you make it a problem.

16:22.850 --> 16:24.579
That's exactly what
you're doing.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.586
That's what you think?

16:26.630 --> 16:29.064
Yeah.

16:29.110 --> 16:30.930
You know what?

16:30.990 --> 16:34.335
I can definitely think of
some other place to be.

16:35.340 --> 16:37.945
[muttering]:
Argument, man...

16:37.990 --> 16:40.515
Somebody's not happy with you.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.121
Oh, please. I don't want to talk
about it right now, get into it.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.957
Can I, uh, get one?
Uh, gin and tonic.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.525
Actually, I'll just have
whatever he's having.Wow.

16:49.570 --> 16:52.084
Not having your usua|?No.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.005
Show of support.

16:54.050 --> 16:56.302
Show of support. [sighs]

16:56.360 --> 16:58.749
There you go. Cheers.Thanks.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.716
You want to tell me
what's wrong?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.318
Geez, you got to be kidding me.

17:08.370 --> 17:10.838
Oh, my God.You know what, let me
ask you a question.

17:10.890 --> 17:14.246
Why does everybody think
that something's wrong?

17:14.290 --> 17:16.064
We don't have to talk
about it. I'm good.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.894
It's fine.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.817
All right, fine, you want
to know what's wrong?

17:19.860 --> 17:21.077
You know, my best
friend, Ray,

17:21.120 --> 17:22.337
he's pulling away
from the teams.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.120
He's loose, and he's
going off the rails.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.388
I got Clay,
who just got shot on my watch.

17:26.430 --> 17:28.034
He's back home.
He's going through rehab.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.079
I don't even know
what the odds are

17:29.130 --> 17:31.041
that he even makes it back.

17:31.090 --> 17:33.081
My old pal Swanny shot himself
in the heart

17:33.130 --> 17:34.472
in the VA parking lot.

17:34.530 --> 17:36.782
He's gone.

17:36.830 --> 17:38.092
My daughter, she hates me.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.789
I'm constantly
worrying about my kids

17:39.840 --> 17:41.398
because they're home alone
because their mother died.

17:41.450 --> 17:43.839
And my A0 is so
far up my ass

17:43.880 --> 17:45.097
because, you know, he
doesn't think I know how

17:45.150 --> 17:47.311
to run my teams.
Myteams.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.531
[sighs]

17:49.590 --> 17:51.717
What, am I supposed to, like,
feel better now that I did that?

17:51.760 --> 17:53.751
[chuckles]:
I don't know.

17:53.810 --> 17:56.506
I don't know, either.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.117
I don't talk about
these things because...

18:01.160 --> 18:02.684
[sighs]

18:02.730 --> 18:04.379
I protect the people
that I care about.

18:04.430 --> 18:06.239
So do you.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.768
No, Jason.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.378
We don't talk about these things

18:10.430 --> 18:12.819
because we want
to protect ourselves.

18:18.310 --> 18:19.345
SONNY [over phone]:
You've reached

18:19.400 --> 18:20.651
the Sonny Quinn request line.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.179
You know what to do.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.834
Hey, it's me.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.053
[sighs] You're probably out
kicking doors.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.352
[chuckles]
Hope you're staying safe.

18:28.410 --> 18:29.570
To be honest,
I really wouldn't mind

18:29.630 --> 18:31.143
being out there
with you right now.

18:31.190 --> 18:33.533
Got this...
got this thing to do.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.103
Wsumm

18:35.150 --> 18:37.106
it's a family thing.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.505
Probably something I should
have done a long time ago.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.802
You know, somebody told me once

18:44.860 --> 18:47.374
that memories you ignore
don't go away.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.159
They just become ghosts.

18:49.210 --> 18:52.168
And I can't live
with ghosts, so...

18:56.480 --> 18:58.607
Hey, Ronnie.

18:58.650 --> 19:01.301
What are you doing here?

19:01.350 --> 19:06.003
I wanted to say hi
to my little sister.

19:06.050 --> 19:08.746
You don't have a sister.

19:08.790 --> 19:10.963
Ronnie.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.751
Please.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.103
Your daughter's beautiful.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.411
She looks just like you did.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.155
RONNIE:
What do you want, Lisa?

19:29.640 --> 19:31.426
I'm still in the Naw.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.597
Um, Officer Candidate
School right now.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.778
I graduate in a couple days.

19:36.820 --> 19:39.516
I'd like you to be there.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.777
Why would I do that?

19:40.830 --> 19:42.434
Because we're family.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.788
Are we?

19:43.830 --> 19:45.695
Do you want to go
another 20 years,

19:45.740 --> 19:47.696
having it divide us?Why not?

19:47.750 --> 19:49.524
Because it hurts.Does it?

19:49.570 --> 19:51.788
Yes, it does.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.355
OCS is tough.

19:55.410 --> 19:57.446
And I was handling it.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.276
You know, I was
kicking ass, even.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.141
Until this fire exercise.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.715
We have to secure a ship
that's engulfed in flames,

20:06.770 --> 20:09.853
put out the fire,
rescue a downed sailor.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.368
And I failed.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.297
History repeating itself?

20:14.340 --> 20:16.467
Oh, come on, Ronnie.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.159
It was not my fault.

20:18.210 --> 20:19.814
I didn't kill Michelle.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.258
A fire did.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.642
You left her inside.

20:22.690 --> 20:24.089
I had to get you.

20:24.130 --> 20:25.256
I had to make a choice.

20:25.310 --> 20:27.346
I was 11 when
the house burned down.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.561
11, trying to save myself

20:29.610 --> 20:31.566
and my two little sisters
from a fire

20:31.620 --> 20:34.316
because our mother was not there
to save all of us.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.351
She was a single mother
doing the best she could.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.537
She was a drunk!

20:38.580 --> 20:41.367
And she was out
drinking again that night.

20:41.410 --> 20:44.231
I couldn't reach Michelle.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.498
I tried. I tried.

20:46.540 --> 20:49.418
There was so much smoke,

20:49.460 --> 20:51.928
and 1-1 couldn't see,

20:51.980 --> 20:55.063
and the fire was
getting bigger, and...

20:55.120 --> 20:57.372
I was terrified.

20:57.430 --> 21:00.240
So I grabbed you,
and I ran.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.996
And Mom blamed me
for Michelle's death

21:03.040 --> 21:05.736
because she sure as hell
wasn't gonna blame herself.

21:06.780 --> 21:10.125
But it wasn't_
my fault, RonnIe.

21:10.180 --> 21:13.559
I wasn't responsible
for Michelle's death.

21:15.010 --> 21:16.966
I know that now.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.966
If you already know that,

21:19.010 --> 21:20.568
then why are you here?

21:20.620 --> 21:22.531
I'm here for you.

21:22.580 --> 21:26.016
I want us to be sisters again.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.416
Have an invitation.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.679
The ceremony's gonna be
on Saturday, and I...

21:38.730 --> 21:39.810
[sniffles]

21:39.860 --> 21:41.851
I hope you'll be there.

22:02.970 --> 22:04.961
Hello there.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.366
They're running tests.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.310
They tested the charges
before the bombings,

22:10.370 --> 22:13.100
and according to our
prisoner, Khan is there.

22:13.150 --> 22:15.618
Testing. It's unusual
sophistication

22:15.680 --> 22:17.238
for groups like this.

22:17.290 --> 22:19.110
Typically, they just
use old artillery rounds

22:19.160 --> 22:20.457
and cell phones.

22:20.510 --> 22:22.068
We need to hit that camp.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.429
Yeah, well,
PACOM is all about low-vis ops.

22:24.470 --> 22:27.109
Not a kinetic op
and not in Pakistan.

22:27.170 --> 22:30.298
Asking Shaw
to approve a mission like this,

22:30.340 --> 22:32.649
in the outer reaches
of this theater...

22:32.690 --> 22:34.954
[chuckles]:
Yeah, odds are slim.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.343
Okay, well, I'll
beat the odds.

22:40.220 --> 22:41.949
Good news, Clay.

22:42.010 --> 22:44.092
You're progressing fine.
You're on schedule.

22:44.140 --> 22:46.961
My right leg's getting
better? You're sure?It is.

22:47.010 --> 22:48.796
When, uh, when do you think
I can make it back to my team?

22:48.840 --> 22:50.535
It's still premature
to speculate,

22:50.580 --> 22:52.536
but if this pace
of healing continues,

22:52.580 --> 22:55.048
I think you'll operate again.

22:55.110 --> 22:56.236
You're fortunate.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.009
Navy Med Center has
an excellent PT staff.

22:58.070 --> 23:00.459
Yeah, fortunate.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.287
Hey, uh, do-do I have anything

23:03.330 --> 23:05.719
in my jacket about a blast-wave
injury from the bomb?

23:05.770 --> 23:08.466
No. There's no mention of it.

23:08.510 --> 23:12.469
First responders were likely
focused on your legs. Why?

23:12.520 --> 23:15.296
I just, uh, had-had a buddy
who couldn't get treated for TBI

23:15.350 --> 23:17.386
'cause his injury
wasn't in his jacket.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.863
Oh, I'm not surprised.

23:18.910 --> 23:21.049
Head injuries
often go unnoticed

23:21.090 --> 23:23.172
when the victim
doesn't lose conSCIousness.

23:23.220 --> 23:26.041
And the lack of self-reporting
is understandable,

23:26.100 --> 23:29.831
given that a TBI can interrupt
or end your military career.

23:31.490 --> 23:33.185
You've, uh...

23:33.230 --> 23:34.959
_You've been
experIenCIng symptoms?

23:35.020 --> 23:36.442
TBI, I mean.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.365
No. No, I-- none.

23:38.410 --> 23:41.800
Not like a team guy
would tell me anyway.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.588
There are a total
of five stations.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.244
Each is graded

23:50.290 --> 23:52.895
and must be completed
before moving on.

23:52.950 --> 23:55.111
If you do not,

23:55.170 --> 23:57.684
the result is
a failing grade.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.082
Any questions?

24:02.220 --> 24:04.040
Very well.

24:04.090 --> 24:05.523
Davis,

24:05.570 --> 24:08.038
you're up first.

24:24.410 --> 24:25.581
[pin drops]

24:46.610 --> 24:47.781
[grunts]

25:06.150 --> 25:08.402
[child's voice echoing]

25:36.230 --> 25:37.561
[grunts]

25:42.930 --> 25:44.921
Midshipman Davis.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.105
Pass.

25:51.370 --> 25:53.895
SHAW:
Are you joking, Miss Ellis?

25:53.940 --> 25:55.805
You're asking me
to approve an operation

25:55.850 --> 25:58.671
into an area that's been waiting
for a war since Gandhi?

25:58.730 --> 26:00.118
Not gonna happen
on my watch.

26:00.160 --> 26:03.630
Sir, Khan is running next-level
operational precision.

26:03.690 --> 26:05.555
In the years
leading up to 9/11,

26:05.600 --> 26:09.388
we saw this with bin Laden,
and we ignored it.

26:09.430 --> 26:12.695
HICKS:
Sir, Yasin Khan is unlike
any other radical out there.

26:12.740 --> 26:14.788
He is a game changer.

26:14.830 --> 26:17.697
For 18 years, we've been playing
whack-a-mole in the Middle East,

26:17.750 --> 26:20.560
reacting to 9/ 11
when we could have prevented it.

26:20.620 --> 26:23.578
We had a chance
to kill Osama bin Laden in 1998,

26:23.620 --> 26:26.088
but our leaders
lacked the will.

26:26.140 --> 26:30.236
Here, with Khan,
we have a similar choice.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.589
If we don't act,

26:33.630 --> 26:35.450
we willpay.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.934
I understand, Agent.

26:37.980 --> 26:40.631
There's still the issue
of Kashmir,

26:40.680 --> 26:43.945
a nuclear-armed
Pakistan and India.

26:43.990 --> 26:45.946
The closest
the world has ever come

26:45.990 --> 26:49.426
to nuclear war_
was over thIs regIon.

26:49.470 --> 26:50.812
Now you're asking me

26:50.870 --> 26:53.168
to drop a couple SEAL teams
directly into it.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.949
Commander Shaw,
you're exactly right.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.696
Khan has set up in this area
because he is banking

26:57.740 --> 26:59.992
on the fact _ _
that we won't rIsk g0Ing In.

27:00.050 --> 27:02.348
It's worth the risk, Commander.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.518
And you want Bravo
to prosecute the target package?

27:06.580 --> 27:09.048
Bravo and Alpha

27:09.100 --> 27:12.888
are the only Tier-One assets
in the AO.

27:12.930 --> 27:15.057
[sighs]

27:20.020 --> 27:22.545
This goes sideways,
it's my career,

27:22.590 --> 27:25.241
which means it's
also all of yours.

27:28.770 --> 27:30.988
Oh, man, I want some nuts.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.031
Let's go. Set 'em up.
Six beers, six shots on me.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.559
I got this round.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.739
Count me out. _
I'm gonna go call NaIma.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.385
That's cute. You go ahead
and you call your wife, Ray.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.862
What's that
supposed to mean?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.342
Just talked to my daughter.

27:42.390 --> 27:43.527
You know what
she's sayIng to me?

27:43.570 --> 27:45.344
She's saying
that Naima told her

27:45.400 --> 27:49.700
that you haven't been talking
to your wife for weeks, Ray.

27:49.750 --> 27:50.921
You want to tell me

27:50.970 --> 27:52.005
what a teenage girl's
doing in my business?

27:52.060 --> 27:53.743
Watch your tone.
That's my daughter.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.142
Why don't you take the air
out your chest, Jason?

27:55.190 --> 27:56.919
Look, all I'm saying is,
this is my business.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.107
You're right.
It isyour business,

27:58.150 --> 27:59.538
but when it starts
affectIng the team,

27:59.590 --> 28:01.012
then it becomes my business.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.675
Guess what. Team affected.
It's my busmess.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.153
You're just looking
for something to be mad at...

28:05.200 --> 28:07.191
That right? We all know
what you're going through, bud.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.239
Mm-hmm.Do you?

28:08.290 --> 28:10.064
Yeah. You haven't prayed
in weeks.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.111
Look, I know what
happened in Mexico.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.424
That church--
that hit you hard, man,

28:14.470 --> 28:16.904
but this isn't you.
This is not Bravo 2, pal.

28:16.950 --> 28:18.429
See, you know what?
That's all you want.

28:18.470 --> 28:19.334
What?
Bravo 2.

28:19.390 --> 28:20.732
Good old Ray,
propping you up.

28:20.780 --> 28:22.771
Propping me up?Yeah, propping you up.

28:22.830 --> 28:24.127
Holding you together,
holding everyone together.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.693
You know, I'm not,
I'm not gonna do this with you.

28:25.740 --> 28:27.082
Mm.
Not untII you get
your own house in order.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.869
Put all your heat
on the team leader

28:28.920 --> 28:31.093
'cause you can't take it
when the heat's on you.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.835
Okay.
There you go again.
There you go again,

28:32.880 --> 28:34.313
calling out
everybody else's imperfections

28:34.360 --> 28:36.408
when your hypocritical ass
is too stubborn to understand

28:36.450 --> 28:39.226
that you've been falling apart
at the seams ever since...

28:39.280 --> 28:41.009
I'm sorry. When?

28:41.060 --> 28:42.493
Since when?
Go ahead, say it.

28:42.540 --> 28:44.064
Say it, Ray.

28:44.110 --> 28:46.499
Since my wife died?
Since Alana?Yeah, since Alana died!

28:46.550 --> 28:48.063
That's what
you're gonna say?You know what?

28:48.110 --> 28:50.249
Man, I'm not even doing this,
because you were too stubborn

28:50.290 --> 28:52.417
to listen to her, so I know
you're not gonna listen to me.

28:52.460 --> 28:54.724
I'm out. Yeah, I'm out. I'm out.You're out? Why you keep
bringing up my family, Ray?

28:54.770 --> 28:56.556
I didn't bring up family!
You brought...

28:56.600 --> 29:00.206
[overlapping shouting]

29:00.260 --> 29:03.206
Come on! Come on.Yeah, it's all about me,
right? All about me, huh?

29:03.260 --> 29:05.160
All about me!Come on. Let's bring it back.

29:05.220 --> 29:06.994
I'm good. I'm good.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.519
Settle down.I'm good, man.

29:08.570 --> 29:10.390
Come on!Walk it off!

29:17.450 --> 29:20.089
Hey, Ray, listen, man, you
and Naima going through stuff,

29:20.140 --> 29:22.700
you know, you can always--
I don't know-- talk to me.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.148
What's that?
What-what you gonna do?

29:24.190 --> 29:25.009
You're gonna, you're gonna
counsel me with all your...

29:25.060 --> 29:27.756
all your marriage experience?

29:27.800 --> 29:29.973
And I'm sick and tired
of Jason holding me up

29:30.020 --> 29:32.022
like I'm... I'm some
damn moral compass.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.504
Hey, you need to take
a breath and sit down.

29:34.550 --> 29:36.506
I don't want to.

29:36.550 --> 29:38.415
Sit your ass down.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.649
[sighs]

29:49.300 --> 29:52.178
Bravo 1 may
lead the team,

29:52.220 --> 29:53.562
but 2 is the glue.

29:53.610 --> 29:55.168
Don't do that.

29:55.220 --> 29:57.688
Don't put that on me.
I did not ask for that.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.092
Maybe you didn't,

29:59.140 --> 30:00.914
but it is what it is, brother.

30:00.970 --> 30:02.392
You know what?

30:02.450 --> 30:05.613
Don't tell me who I am, Sonny.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.092
I know who I am.

30:07.150 --> 30:09.926
[laughing]:
Oh. All right then.

30:09.980 --> 30:15.100
So the guy that punches his
team leader and his best friend?

30:15.160 --> 30:18.800
That who you really
are, Ray Perry?

30:29.690 --> 30:32.124
You know
Shaw has eyes on us.

30:32.170 --> 30:34.479
He's waiting for us
to screw up.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.078
It's hard for me
to understand

30:36.130 --> 30:38.690
why what happened
in that bar happened.

30:39.700 --> 30:41.565
Don't know.

30:41.620 --> 30:42.962
You don't know?

30:43.010 --> 30:44.659
Look, I let it get to me.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.393
Let what get to you?

30:46.450 --> 30:48.964
[sighs] Ray-- he's
got something going on.

30:49.020 --> 30:50.829
Been dealing with something
ever since Mexico, you know?

30:50.890 --> 30:53.279
Should have seen it, should have
taken care of it much earlier,

30:53.320 --> 30:54.844
but I didn't.

30:54.890 --> 30:56.881
This isn't about Ray.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.896
Jason, you've got a heaw load.

30:59.940 --> 31:01.498
Come on.

31:01.550 --> 31:03.893
Trying to fill the role
of both parents for your kids

31:03.940 --> 31:05.896
and lead this team.

31:05.950 --> 31:09.169
But you cannot do it all,
not without help.

31:09.210 --> 31:10.689
Who says I need help?

31:10.730 --> 31:12.334
The cracks.

31:12.390 --> 31:13.994
Cracks that are
startIng to show.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.998
They scream it loud.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.521
Jason, you need
to quit making excuses.

31:20.570 --> 31:23.300
[exhales]And take a close look
at yourself.

31:26.270 --> 31:27.999
'Cause Bravo team is suffering.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.927
And if things don't change,

31:30.970 --> 31:33.928
there's a good chance
this team gets dismantled.

31:33.970 --> 31:38.191
If that happens, it won't be
on Shaw, won't be on Ray.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.583
It'll be on you.

School Class 2019.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.865
Congratulations, Ensigns.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.694
Today marks the beginning
of your career

32:06.750 --> 32:09.048
as a commissioned officer.

32:09.100 --> 32:12.570
From this day forward, you will
wear the uniform of a leader.

32:12.620 --> 32:17.626
There will be times when you
must make hard decisions.

32:17.670 --> 32:20.844
Decisions that you must make
on your own.

32:20.890 --> 32:24.360
Decisions that require courage,

32:24.420 --> 32:27.412
decisions that affect
your natIon.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.985
When those times come,
I urge you all

32:30.030 --> 32:32.339
to think back on this day,

32:32.380 --> 32:34.894
on the events that led you here.

32:34.950 --> 32:36.724
Think back to all
you've learned,

32:36.780 --> 32:39.385
all you've accomplished.

32:39.430 --> 32:43.776
Your failures, as well
as your triumphs...

33:21.650 --> 33:23.459
SONNY:
All that running around
chasing Commies,

33:23.520 --> 33:25.954
and we're back to the same old
meat and potaters.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.605
As you all know, it's common
practice for Pakistani military

33:28.650 --> 33:30.379
and intelligence to fund,
recruit

33:30.440 --> 33:32.089
and train terrorist cells.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.608
I bet that connection's
the man who trained Tareen.

33:34.660 --> 33:37.174
Got a winner.
Yasin Khan.

33:37.230 --> 33:40.927
Khan_ran 151 and Pakistani
speCIal operatIons teams.

33:40.970 --> 33:43.621
Khan's MD. has always been
providing funding

33:43.670 --> 33:46.275
and target packages
for extremist cells,

33:46.320 --> 33:48.754
but as his influence increased,

33:48.800 --> 33:51.883
Khan began turning on
and activating

33:51.940 --> 33:54.716
terrorist cells within
non-extremIst groups.

33:54.770 --> 33:58.672
Like our Communist friends in
Thailand and the Philippines.

33:58.730 --> 34:01.198
Yes. He's solidifying his
influence in the region.

34:01.250 --> 34:02.376
Why?

34:02.430 --> 34:04.466
Because he wants the region.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.080
Destabilized and terrorized.

34:07.130 --> 34:08.813
ERIC:
Yasin Khan is the
man responsible

34:08.870 --> 34:10.997
for the bombing
that sent Clay Stateside.

34:11.040 --> 34:15.136
He's also shaping up to be
the next Osama bin Laden.

34:15.180 --> 34:18.081
We tracked his camp
to the disputed area

34:18.140 --> 34:20.096
of the Kashmir mountains.

34:20.140 --> 34:24.099
Langley has bumped him up
to capture/kill priority.

34:24.140 --> 34:26.404
We'll be executing this one
off the books.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.756
Nothing, and I mean nothing
can go wrong on this one.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.418
I'm gonna take a shot in the
dark here and say that Pakistan

34:41.470 --> 34:42.949
doesn't want us playing
in their backyard, yeah?

34:42.990 --> 34:45.333
ERIC: Well, given their recent
aggression on both sides

34:45.380 --> 34:47.371
and the fact that Pakistan
and India tensions

34:47.430 --> 34:50.035
haven't been this high
since the early '705, no.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.162
If your presence is discovered,
it could start a war.

34:52.220 --> 34:55.565
I bet Shaw's happier than a pig
in mud over this op.

34:55.610 --> 34:58.989
If we can't breach in Pakistani
aIrspace, we drop In over IndIa.

34:59.050 --> 35:01.359
Exactly. HAHO's
the only way.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.652
You'll be crossing into
Kashmir under canopy

35:03.710 --> 35:05.393
after opening over India.

35:05.450 --> 35:08.089
Those mountains are pretty high.
K2's what, 28,000 feet?

35:08.140 --> 35:09.573
Correct.

35:09.620 --> 35:12.407
But your course has you passing
through a saddle

35:12.450 --> 35:15.920
which peaks at 15,000 feet.

35:15.980 --> 35:20.235
That gives you a 3,000-foot
window for error, so, ideally,

35:20.290 --> 35:22.588
you'll pass over the mountain
range at about 18,000.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.859
Well, that sure doesn't give us
a lot of wiggle room.

35:25.900 --> 35:28.334
Sure doesn't.

35:28.380 --> 35:31.201
If you open below 18,000 feet,
you're gonna land

35:31.250 --> 35:32.854
on the east side
of the mountain,

35:32.910 --> 35:34.946
which, according to our intel,
is chock-full of enemy.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.868
If that happens,
you'll be forced to E&E.

35:38.910 --> 35:41.561
Well, that's a deterrent
ifI ever heard of one.

35:41.610 --> 35:44.261
Once you're on the
ground, we lose ISR,

35:44.310 --> 35:45.959
and comms will be spotty.

35:46.010 --> 35:49.525
So we'll be all alone,
what else is new.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.276
Let's get our gear ready,
grab some rest.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.539
We meet at
the staging area at 1500.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.138
Hey.JASON: Yeah.

35:57.190 --> 35:59.238
ERIC:
Sonny was right
back there.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.679
Sonny's never right
about anything.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.449
Yeah, well, he's
right about Shaw.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.799
To say that man's unhappy
is a vast understatement.

36:07.070 --> 36:10.028
This op could make
or break his career.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.377
And ours.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.047
BRETT:
When you're a team guy,

36:28.090 --> 36:31.787
that's what you live for.

36:31.840 --> 36:35.833
There's nothing like
that feeling, that rush.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.661
You are the tip of the spear.

36:48.200 --> 36:51.806
I've got a different
mission now.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.851
They tell you in BUD/S,

36:53.900 --> 36:55.982
the only easy day was yesterday.

36:57.990 --> 37:01.118
I'm gonna work this
like I worked BUD/S.

37:03.390 --> 37:05.381
One day at a time.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.795
I got this. Lead us out.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.752
Roger that.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.234
All right, boys.
Let's get ready...

37:30.240 --> 37:32.151
CLAY:
Brett Swann lived
five more years.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.158
But that explosion is the
combat injury that killed him.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.849
Brett deserves
a Purple Heart.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.811
And I'd like for you to
request an award review.

37:42.470 --> 37:44.734
All right, Spenser.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.645
It'll take at least six months.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.738
That's fine, sir.

37:48.780 --> 37:52.170
And the request will
most likely be denied.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.393
The standard for
the Purple Heart,

37:54.440 --> 37:56.692
when it comes to
a blast-wave Injury,

37:56.750 --> 37:58.968
is that it needs_to cause
a loss of conSCIousness

37:59.010 --> 38:02.571
or be severe enough to require
treatment by a medical officer.

38:02.620 --> 38:04.269
Brett never asked
for treatment.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.799
It's not in his jacket.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.013
Would you have asked, sir?No.

38:08.060 --> 38:09.925
No, that's not the point.

38:09.980 --> 38:12.414
The point is a Purple Heart
will not be awarded

38:12.460 --> 38:14.803
because Brett did exactly
what you and I would do:

38:14.850 --> 38:16.329
he didn't report it.

38:16.380 --> 38:17.802
He should have.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.851
But he didn't feel
like he could.

38:19.900 --> 38:22.334
And that's what
needs to change.

38:22.380 --> 38:24.200
This medal isn't just for
Swanny, this is for all of us

38:24.250 --> 38:25.683
who could wind up just like him.

38:25.730 --> 38:26.992
I understand that.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.601
The military has to draw
a line somewhere

38:30.650 --> 38:32.823
until we know more about TBI.

38:32.870 --> 38:35.998
We're not gonna know more
until we change the system.

38:36.050 --> 38:39.042
It has to be reported in order
to be studied and treated.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.314
If the military won't pay
attention to the problem,

38:46.360 --> 38:48.225
maybe the press will.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.360
Spenser,

38:52.410 --> 38:54.844
I'm on your side here.
I really am.

38:54.890 --> 38:57.233
But if you take this
outside of our orbit,

38:57.290 --> 38:58.803
you'll be throwing away
your career

38:58.850 --> 39:00.249
and facing a court-martial.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.111
[indistinct radio chatter]

39:15.300 --> 39:17.643
[grunts]

39:17.700 --> 39:20.089
Not now, Sonny.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.563
Now is all we got, Jace.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.565
We're 30,000 feet
over India,

39:24.620 --> 39:26.918
about to jump into
a hornet's nest.

39:26.970 --> 39:28.870
We got a cake-eater who's
supposed to have our back,

39:28.930 --> 39:30.272
and who's getting
his knife ready.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.015
And?

39:32.060 --> 39:34.108
And?
Yeah.

39:34.150 --> 39:36.971
Things aren't right
with you and Ray.

39:37.020 --> 39:39.329
The guy took a swing at me.The guy?

39:39.370 --> 39:42.760
That guy is Ray. Bravo 2.
Your best friend.
Mm.

39:42.810 --> 39:45.028
Yeah, you're both in the wrong
taking a swing at each other.

39:45.070 --> 39:46.856
You got to
make it right, J.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.982
JASON: No, what I need to do
is keep my head in the game.

39:49.030 --> 39:50.907
The_mission's the
only thIng that matters.

39:50.950 --> 39:53.202
Ray knows that, too.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.421
[sighs]

39:55.480 --> 39:57.129
Y'all are a bunch of children.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.471
All right, time to
get jocked up.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.234
[indistinct radio chatter]

41:08.290 --> 41:09.973
All right, Master Chief
Hayes will radio in

41:10.030 --> 41:11.634
once all the operators
are under canopy.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.728
Sounds good.
When do we...

41:13.770 --> 41:15.818
JASON:
Havoc this is 1, I have six.

41:15.860 --> 41:18.556
RAY:
I got a line over!

41:18.600 --> 41:20.295
Say again, line over.

41:20.340 --> 41:23.161
I'm working.

41:23.210 --> 41:25.258
[garbled radio transmission]

41:25.300 --> 41:27.473
JASON: Work the problem, Ray.
Work the problem.

41:31.350 --> 41:33.523
RAY:
I'm working it.

41:33.570 --> 41:36.175
Too long.
I've got to cut away.

41:36.230 --> 41:37.743
JASON:
Ray!

41:37.790 --> 41:39.189
RAY:
I'm cutting away.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.709
Tell Naima I love her.

41:42.230 --> 41:45.142
[garbled radio transmission]

41:45.190 --> 41:49.194
Bravo 2, this is Havoc Base,
radio check, over.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.708
[garbled radio transmission]

41:54.250 --> 41:56.889
Bravo 2, come in.

41:56.940 --> 41:59.022
[indistinct shouting over radio]

41:59.080 --> 42:00.980
Bravo 1, what just happened?

42:04.170 --> 42:06.900
JASON: Havoc, this is 1.
Bravo 2 has a chute malfunction

42:06.950 --> 42:08.429
and had to cut away
from his main.

42:08.480 --> 42:11.381
I say again, Bravo 2
had to cut away from his main.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.431
Copy that, Bravo 1.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.608
Did anyone see
his reserve deploy?

42:16.660 --> 42:21.051
JASON [staticky]:
Havoc, this is 1. Negative.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.568
They're flying through the pass,
we're gonna lose them on comms.

42:23.620 --> 42:27.442
Bravo 1, say again your last.

42:27.500 --> 42:30.401
[garbled radio transmission]

42:30.460 --> 42:34.328
JASON: Havoc, this is 1.
We've lost Bravo 2.

42:34.370 --> 42:36.804
I say again,
we've lost Bravo 2.
