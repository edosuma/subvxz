[chicken clucking]

00:13.747 --> 00:15.648
[phone chimes]

00:30.000 --> 00:30.764
Yes Greg. Yes I do.

00:31.064 --> 00:34.334
[groaning and moaning]

00:38.738 --> 00:40.840
[Lauren moans loudly]

00:43.576 --> 00:45.345
[kissing sounds]

00:51.651 --> 00:53.186
Oh god!

00:55.488 --> 00:57.123
Hey um...

01:00.000 --> 01:00.427
..you're a lawyer right?

01:01.394 --> 01:03.163
Oh god, you don't
need legal advice do you?

01:06.000 --> 01:06.232
No, no, no...
I mean, the power's out,

01:07.434 --> 01:09.202
the mattress
is on the floor.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.972
I can spot you
like twenty bucks.

01:13.373 --> 01:16.709
Oh thanks, but no,
my ex took my bed.

01:18.000 --> 01:18.878
What a dick!

01:22.115 --> 01:22.982
[chicken clucks loudly]

01:24.000 --> 01:24.684
[Greg screams]

01:25.685 --> 01:26.319
[Greg] Oh there's a chicken.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.189
-Yeah, that's Angus.
-Oh hey Angus.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.790
I'm actually not all
that fond of chickens.

01:30.857 --> 01:31.791
Oh.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.227
This one seems
quite territorial.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.361
Yes she is.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.131
It's coming, no it's coming!

01:38.198 --> 01:40.333
-Just don't look at her.
-Okay.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.737
# I'm like a candle burning

[chicken purrs]

01:56.649 --> 01:58.284
Hi.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.027
[gentle music]

02:30.116 --> 02:31.718
[Lola] Yummy, yummy toast.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.019
Oh!

02:33.086 --> 02:34.554
Morning Bosslet. Breakfast!

02:36.000 --> 02:36.055
When did you get back?

02:36.122 --> 02:37.657
Early doors! Want some caviar?

02:37.724 --> 02:38.892
What happened to the clock?

02:38.958 --> 02:40.827
Oh it, it fell.
It had an accident.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.729
[Roger] You know the powers
out? I had to use the camp
stove.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.831
[Carol] Lauren! Have
a look at these darling.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.267
Aren't they wonderful?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.168
Anyway I'll take a look at the
wiring after breakfast.

02:49.235 --> 02:51.070
We're painting our entire
holiday.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.273
I'm doing penguins in bowties.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.642
Oh, that's lovely. Quite
a lot of painting though.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.811
[Carol] Yes, well, you can't
stifle creativity Floss.

02:58.878 --> 02:59.679
What's this?

03:00.000 --> 03:00.780
[Abby] Oh we want
you to stay here.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.781
As opposed to?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.283
[Lola] Going.
To Dad's new house.

03:06.000 --> 03:06.152
[Roger] The kids wanted to
start sorting some of their
bits out.

03:06.219 --> 03:09.155
[Carol] Yes we stopped over at
Jake's new place on the way,

03:09.222 --> 03:10.990
and it's--
-[Lola] Ginormous!

03:12.000 --> 03:12.258
It has a pool.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.994
Dad said we can
have a trampoline.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.963
Wow! Great.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.732
Yeah eat up your toast Lola,
gotta get big and strong.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.602
I don't care about
being big and strong,

03:24.000 --> 03:24.103
I just want to be pretty.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.506
Okay, well we definitely
need to talk about that.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.074
I mean they're not
mutually exclusive.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.443
But I don't want
to get any bigger.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.078
[Lauren] Well you can't
stay small forever.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.517
But if I get big, then I'll
look like you, with your big
face.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.352
You see, my face
is small and pretty

03:42.000 --> 03:42.822
and yours is kind of
big, giant, but squished.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.426
Thank you, for sharing that.

03:49.362 --> 03:50.396
Hi ya.

03:50.463 --> 03:51.431
Oh hello.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.199
Got you a soy latte.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.934
I drink almond,
but that's okay.

03:55.001 --> 03:55.935
Ah.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.271
No, no, no, it's nice.
Thank you.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.041
Ah, you know the coffee
in London is diabolical.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.844
-It's gross.
-Really? Ah.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.648
Have you made a decision?

04:09.315 --> 04:11.250
-Ah, no.
-Oh.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.219
I can really see
you in London Alex.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.689
All the fog and pigeons
and the chimney sweeps.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.992
That's literally
the set of Mary Poppins.

04:19.058 --> 04:20.927
Yeah I know, obviously.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.930
Oh my god,
this coffee's so good.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.032
Wow!

04:27.333 --> 04:29.669
[Lauren moans]

04:36.000 --> 04:36.075
[door shuts]

04:42.000 --> 04:43.282
Ange, is it Bob again?

04:44.150 --> 04:45.485
I'm fine.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.390
Well, if you want to talk to me
then just come and find me
okay?

04:50.456 --> 04:53.126
Did you snort cocaine
off Dallas' willy?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.361
Oh god.

04:55.695 --> 04:57.163
Cocaine!

04:57.230 --> 04:59.532
-Ah, well--
-Off his willy!

05:00.000 --> 05:01.734
Ah no! Yes! No! Ange?

05:03.336 --> 05:05.571
[Lauren] Did he tell you...
off his penis...

05:06.000 --> 05:06.806
Sorry!

05:07.340 --> 05:10.009
I don't know why...
I'm so sorry, yes I did!

05:12.000 --> 05:13.579
I did snort it...
I'm sorry.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.947
Are you mainly cross
about the cocaine,

05:15.014 --> 05:17.450
or are you mainly cross
about the Dallas' penis bit?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.085
You know that
I am on the board--

05:19.152 --> 05:20.253
I know--

05:20.319 --> 05:21.654
Of Family Lawyers
Against Illegal Drugs

05:21.721 --> 05:22.855
Consultation Help Group.

05:24.000 --> 05:24.157
You know that about me--

05:24.223 --> 05:26.325
I just don't understand why
he would tell you about it.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.561
No he didn't tell me.
It's here, look!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.230
There!
[Lauren gasps]

05:31.297 --> 05:34.000
Black and white
and shade of blue.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.070
[Lauren] Oh god. Oh god!

05:37.136 --> 05:38.471
Shit! Alex!

05:38.538 --> 05:39.672
Hello?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.109
Oh fuck! Why is this here?
How do you have this?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.277
Why do you have this?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.012
Mr. Hilton is moving
over to Baxter Lang.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.683
I'm sending them his files.
It's labelled HMTF.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.552
Yes! Hot Men To Fuck!

05:52.618 --> 05:53.886
-No.
-Oh.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.489
Also Hilton Marriage
Term Financials.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.357
-Why didn't you file it Alex!
-Sorry.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.692
If this was accidently send to
our biggest competitor,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.428
then that would be a lot of
compromising information.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.897
[Alex] Including someone who
actually works at Baxter Lang.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.232
[Lauren] Oh, how do we,
how do we get rid of it?

06:06.299 --> 06:09.001
I tried to delete it
but it's still uploading!

06:09.068 --> 06:10.069
Uploading?!

06:10.136 --> 06:11.337
Where is it uploading?

06:12.000 --> 06:12.905
-What?
-Where? Where?

06:12.972 --> 06:14.240
[Ange] I don't know.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.641
So what server did you say...

06:15.708 --> 06:17.043
Um, which server?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.279
The main one, ah, the big one.

06:20.346 --> 06:23.416
Okay. Baxter Lang. These are
the files currently
transferring--

06:24.000 --> 06:25.218
Oh, okay. If you can
stop this right now

06:25.284 --> 06:27.186
I will give you my brand new
ergonomic swivel chair.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.655
What! To keep?

06:30.000 --> 06:30.890
Yes!

06:31.457 --> 06:35.027
Okay, um, any of
these ones here?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.663
Yes, that one there. That
excel spreadsheet just there.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.965
Okay, you are very,
very lucky ducks

06:39.031 --> 06:41.501
because that is not
finished transferring.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.069
It's still uploading.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.104
God, the joys of the
National Broadband, am I right?

06:45.171 --> 06:46.339
[all laugh]

06:46.405 --> 06:47.240
It's been like two hours.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.674
-Please!
-Cancelled.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.309
Just checking,
it's definitely not going

06:50.376 --> 06:52.612
to start uploading
itself again is it?

06:54.000 --> 06:54.380
That's, no.

06:54.447 --> 06:56.449
They can't get like
67 percent of it?

07:00.000 --> 07:00.086
-Also not how it works.
-Yeah, great.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.121
Oh god!

07:03.122 --> 07:04.123
What the...

07:06.000 --> 07:06.025
-[Roger] Hello Bosslet.
-Dad?

07:06.092 --> 07:07.026
What's going on?

07:07.093 --> 07:09.328
Why are there wires
all over the place?

07:12.000 --> 07:12.365
Well, it turns out that all
the wiring's a bit ropey.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.134
Typical of an
electrician's house.

07:15.802 --> 07:16.769
All of it?

07:18.000 --> 07:18.171
Well it's all connected
Bosslet.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.406
I realise that, but why are
you finding this out now.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.308
I just want to check it out
for you before we left.

07:24.000 --> 07:24.944
Yes precisely, you're leaving.
So why you doing it now?

07:25.011 --> 07:26.746
Well I'm just
hooking up the temp power,

07:26.813 --> 07:28.347
a little genny
under the house.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.050
And while I was down there
I found a load of old wiring,

07:31.117 --> 07:32.852
that had been chewed
through by something.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.321
Maybe an Antechinus.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.524
-Antechinus?
-Little rodents.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.059
I've got rats?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.262
Well not necessarily and
they're marsupials actually.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.500
No you know what. I'm sorry
Dad, I quit! Yeah, I quit!

07:49.135 --> 07:51.204
Give me strength.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.872
-She's here.
-Oh quick.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.107
[Abby] You're going
to be so gobsmacked.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.278
[Lauren laughs] Oh wow!

08:00.947 --> 08:04.684
Oh that is beautiful.
Mum is this you?

08:04.750 --> 08:05.818
Well...

08:06.000 --> 08:07.086
Thank you.

08:07.153 --> 08:11.123
Mama this is you with your big
beautiful giant squished head.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.393
Oh thank you.
Thank you.

08:18.000 --> 08:18.831
Thank you.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.800
[Roger] Lauren?

08:20.867 --> 08:21.701
Ah.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.970
[Lola] Yeah let's go
pack up the stuff.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.471
Wow!

08:25.538 --> 08:28.407
Put it together from a few bits
I found under the house.

08:28.474 --> 08:29.342
[knock on wood]

08:30.000 --> 08:31.010
-Should do you for a while.
-Thanks Dad.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.312
Sorry about just now.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.548
I've done all the preliminary
stuff but you're going to need

08:36.000 --> 08:38.084
a professional to
untangle that mess.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.553
Yeah. I wish
you weren't going.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.721
Me too.

08:42.822 --> 08:45.424
You know, it's all right
to get upset sometimes.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.027
We all have feelings,
even you Bosslet.

08:48.094 --> 08:51.364
-Yeah, well I don't like it.
-I know.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.966
Chin up. You'll be fine.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.436
[car horn honks]

08:57.670 --> 08:59.605
Oh Carol, a taxi's here.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.707
[Carol] Coming Roger.

09:01.774 --> 09:03.676
Nana, when are we
coming to see you?

09:03.743 --> 09:05.978
Oh, soon my possum.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.714
Just remember we don't
say goodbyes do we?

09:08.781 --> 09:10.416
Come here, you too Abby.

09:12.000 --> 09:12.551
My little smarty pants
the pair of you.

09:12.618 --> 09:13.719
Thank you Mum.

09:13.786 --> 09:14.854
Here's your scarf Grandpa.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.455
Love you.

09:16.522 --> 09:17.990
Love you Bosslet.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.192
-Love you. Love you.
-Come on.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.429
Oh and they're sending someone
to collect the RV tomorrow.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.264
Don't, please,
just wave from the window.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.565
Okay Mum.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.905
Got your stuff ready
for Dad's tonight?

09:32.972 --> 09:33.739
Tick.

09:33.806 --> 09:34.740
Lola?

09:36.000 --> 09:36.008
Tock.

09:42.848 --> 09:44.383
Bye.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.457
Anyone fancy caviar?

09:51.524 --> 09:52.992
-Race you.
-Great.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.030
[Helena] You all right?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.068
Yeah. I just don't
like goodbyes.

10:02.134 --> 10:05.204
You just need to keep busy.
Mum says you're painting.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.473
Oh my god. You two
and your bloody painting.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.342
I'm actually going on a date

10:09.408 --> 10:11.911
with the trouser snake,
chicken hater.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.980
Trouser snake, chicken hater.
That's right.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.314
God, careful with that hammer.

10:18.000 --> 10:18.084
Oh I just need to get this
bloody hook off this wall.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.952
Did Dad really take
apart all your wiring

10:20.019 --> 10:21.253
just before leaving?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.989
Yeah, he makes a habit
of that doesn't he.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.591
Yeah, do you remember when he
took the stairs out at home,

10:25.658 --> 10:28.494
and then went to Greece
for work for three weeks!

10:28.561 --> 10:29.395
Yeah.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.830
At least he left us
with a stepladder.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.999
Hey. Sorry, the
front door was open.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.200
Was it?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.703
Yeah, and you said you might
have time for a quick chat.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.306
-Um, did I?
-Hm.

10:42.000 --> 10:42.908
[Helena] Hello.
Oh is this the snake--

10:42.975 --> 10:46.979
No. This is, ah,
Matt the milk man.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.180
Ah, paramedic.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.315
The Kefir King!

10:49.382 --> 10:50.783
-Yeah.
-I do like it.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.120
Hi. I've heard that Kefir
is really good on muesli,

10:54.186 --> 10:57.356
and would you use almond milk
or cows for that Matt?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.027
Sometimes coconut water,
which is fun, so...

11:01.093 --> 11:03.262
Sorry. I don't want
to interrupt your chat.

11:06.000 --> 11:06.265
But you did say that we
could catch up tonight.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.301
-[Helena] Did you indeed?
-Yeah, I remember now.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.305
Ah, but that was
before this hole.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.940
Which I've got to fix,
and the...

11:15.007 --> 11:16.842
Yeah, does look
quite pressing.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.445
Um, the thing wouldn't
have to be for that long.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.546
Hm.

11:24.000 --> 11:24.250
I just wanted to find out
how you feel about um...

11:25.451 --> 11:26.485
..the sex.

11:26.552 --> 11:27.386
[Lauren screams in pain]

11:27.453 --> 11:28.421
Sorry.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.022
Oh my gosh, are
you all right?

11:30.089 --> 11:31.424
-[Matt] Wow!
-[Lauren groans]

11:31.490 --> 11:32.892
Oh god! All right
I'll get my kit.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.293
-[Lauren cries] It really
hurts. -Sorry.

11:42.000 --> 11:42.802
I'm just saying, you need to
consider all of the angles.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.770
London is a very
dangerous place.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.872
Yep. Thank you Captain
Birdseye.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.441
You're not going to
tell me what happened?

11:48.507 --> 11:50.142
-Matt happened.
-Ah, okay.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.378
No, no, no, I mean I happened
because of Matt...

11:54.000 --> 11:54.113
I don't want to talk about it.

11:54.413 --> 11:56.082
[Big Ben phone chime]

12:00.000 --> 12:01.420
Wow! Have you got a
personalised ringtone for Peter
now?

12:02.121 --> 12:04.356
Yep he says he needs to
start making arrangements.

12:04.423 --> 12:05.591
If I'm going.

12:06.158 --> 12:08.027
-He needs to know by tomorrow.
-Right.

12:12.000 --> 12:12.698
You know, they found nine of
the world's most deadly
super-bugs

12:12.765 --> 12:15.267
on the Tube, including E. coli.

12:15.334 --> 12:16.368
-Okay.
-Hm. Wow.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.271
And lots and lots of faeces.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.008
Hmm. Thank you Simon.

12:24.000 --> 12:24.443
-Great.
-Happy to help.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.245
And thank you for stopping
the transfer yesterday,

12:26.312 --> 12:27.613
honestly I appreciate it.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.281
No problemo sombrero.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.752
Actually, what did you do
about the hard copies?

12:38.257 --> 12:39.959
[upbeat music]

12:40.025 --> 12:41.894
[man] Sorry, so let me
get this straight.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.299
So my name and the um, intimate
details of our sexual
encounter,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.268
-are on a spreadsheet?
-Yes.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.137
-Somewhere inside my office?
-Yes.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.371
Yes.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.405
Well you know what it's like

12:54.000 --> 12:54.540
when you are
overloaded with work

12:54.607 --> 12:57.476
and time management is an
issue, so I had a spreadsheet.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.178
Wait! How much detail?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.447
-Warrior, warrior baby!
-You mean?

13:01.514 --> 13:02.515
Warrior baby.

13:02.581 --> 13:03.616
-And, and--
-Yeah

13:03.682 --> 13:04.917
Well I have to remember.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.218
It was role play!

13:06.285 --> 13:08.320
Sorry. Apologies.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.357
Fuck! Shit!

13:12.000 --> 13:12.424
And...

13:12.491 --> 13:14.226
-Oh fuck, shit! Come on.
-Okay thank you. Thanks.

13:15.227 --> 13:16.495
Thank you so much.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.934
Do you not have a key
to your own mail room?

13:24.000 --> 13:24.336
No, because I'm a Partner here,
not the mail room guy.

13:24.403 --> 13:25.304
[Alex] It's right there.

13:25.371 --> 13:26.338
Stop buggering around
and open that door.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.273
Open the door.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.140
I honestly can't,
I just told you that.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.509
If I was a Partner here I'd
have a skeleton key to every
room.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.077
Skeleton keys aren't real so--

13:32.144 --> 13:35.548
Aren't real! [Simon scoffs]
Aren't real!? This guy.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.017
Guys let's think.
Should we break the glass?

13:38.083 --> 13:40.786
No, we should set it on fire.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.923
We could flood it. Yeah that
would work. Water damage. Yeah.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.592
No, no, no we are not flooding
or setting on fire.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.794
No, we're just going to wait
for the mail room guy to come
back.

13:48.861 --> 13:49.828
Well how long
is he going to be?

13:49.895 --> 13:51.330
I don't know, oh my god...

13:54.066 --> 13:55.301
[fire alarm rings]

13:56.001 --> 13:57.169
Morning.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.205
Everyone's just going to think
it was a small malfunction.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.539
I have no words.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.474
-[phone chimes]
-Hang on.

14:03.108 --> 14:05.211
Okay. Wow, it worked.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.112
Apparently every bit of
paper on that floor is pulp.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.547
[all laugh]

14:08.614 --> 14:09.481
Oh thank God.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.884
So Lauren, I thought
if Alex is leaving

14:12.000 --> 14:14.353
there's going to be an opening
for a new wing-man right?

14:14.420 --> 14:15.321
Yeah, I guess so.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.222
Well I've taken the liberty

14:16.488 --> 14:17.523
to track your progress on
the Spreadsheet already.

14:18.000 --> 14:18.657
So I kind of know what--

14:18.724 --> 14:19.858
What?

14:24.000 --> 14:24.230
Yeah, I'm fully briefed.
I know, I know everything so...

14:24.296 --> 14:25.231
Everything?

14:25.297 --> 14:29.101
Yeah, so I could be
your Robin, Batman.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.603
Batperson?

14:30.669 --> 14:31.937
What are you going
to do without me?

14:32.004 --> 14:35.908
Yeah, and I can, I've got
some plans for a league table,

14:36.000 --> 14:36.775
so it would be like
Premiere division,

14:36.842 --> 14:38.844
first division, second
division.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.579
Ah, it's still a
work in progress.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.819
[Lauren sighs]

14:48.000 --> 14:48.053
Lauren?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.421
Ah, Matt.

14:49.488 --> 14:50.589
Hey, I'm glad I caught you.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.725
I was going to call, sorry.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.926
Listen, I know you
got a lot of stuff on.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.227
Yeah, I've had a shocking day.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.396
Look, I need to know
where I stand.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.032
I know first and
foremost we're mates.

15:00.099 --> 15:01.100
Exactly.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.801
But seriously Loz,

15:02.868 --> 15:05.537
I actually think there
might be something here.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.007
Yeah, but we are, we're mates.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.842
-Yep.
-And you're mates with Jake.

15:09.908 --> 15:11.844
And it all just feels too
matey.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.078
No, I get it, it's complicated.

15:13.145 --> 15:16.615
And I need to put my children
first and what I need is...

15:16.682 --> 15:17.683
..simplicity.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.784
Right.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.819
And I just don't need a
relationship with anyone.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.921
I can't do more.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.759
Okay, listen.
Being friends is good,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.130
but don't you want someone
to look after you or...

15:31.196 --> 15:32.498
No!

15:36.000 --> 15:36.435
I don't need someone
to look after me Matt.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.737
-Okay?
-Okay.

15:38.804 --> 15:40.406
-Yeah.
-Right.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.509
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.644
[Greg] Whoo!

15:45.711 --> 15:46.945
[Matt] Greg! Hey.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.048
[Matt] What are you doing here?

15:49.114 --> 15:53.652
[Greg] I'm... Me?
I'm coming to see Lauren.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.554
Check she's okay after we
had to cancel last night.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.956
Yes. Have you met?

16:00.000 --> 16:00.326
-Fuck off!
-What?

16:00.392 --> 16:01.660
Oh.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.562
-Fuck off.
-Oh dear.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.498
-Jodi Reginatto! -Ah, what are
you talking about?

16:06.565 --> 16:07.566
-You...
-What?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.335
Ahh! What are
you talking about.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.104
Sorry, do you know
each other or?

16:12.171 --> 16:13.005
He's my brother.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.741
Oh you're joking. Oh god.

16:16.342 --> 16:17.276
You absolute...

16:18.000 --> 16:19.278
[men struggle]

16:19.345 --> 16:20.379
Oh no.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.214
Please tell me you
didn't sleep with him.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.817
No. Yes. No.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.119
A bit.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.020
What are you doing here?

16:30.000 --> 16:30.155
What am I doing here?
She's my friend!

16:30.222 --> 16:31.256
Mate!

16:32.291 --> 16:33.459
She's my neighbour.

16:33.525 --> 16:34.593
What?

16:36.000 --> 16:36.261
Yeah I live over there
now, but of course

16:36.328 --> 16:39.131
you don't read the family
newsletter you dickhead.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.100
[men moan and groan]

16:42.000 --> 16:42.401
Guys, the neighbours.

16:42.468 --> 16:43.469
-Get off!
-No!

16:43.535 --> 16:45.003
Ahh!

16:45.070 --> 16:47.539
[yelling]

16:48.640 --> 16:51.610
That's, awful.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.646
[Lauren] Yeah,
see you later guys.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.014
[Greg] I hate you!

16:56.081 --> 16:57.850
Don't make too much noise.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.416
Oh, oh, oh,
babe, babe, babe.

18:06.000 --> 18:06.618
Pull my finger.

18:06.685 --> 18:07.553
-No.
-Pull it!

18:07.619 --> 18:08.720
-No.
-Go, go!

18:08.787 --> 18:09.755
[Jake farts]

18:09.822 --> 18:11.990
-[both laugh]
-You're disgusting.

18:12.724 --> 18:14.393
Don't, Jake!

18:18.630 --> 18:20.132
How's it looking?

18:20.199 --> 18:22.835
Yeah, the eye patch
makes you look at bit freaky.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.970
No, not me. The wiring?

18:25.037 --> 18:26.472
Oh no, well sweet as.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.574
You're old man and his
unfinished projects hey?

18:30.000 --> 18:30.409
-Yeah.
-All good. Almost done.

18:30.476 --> 18:31.477
Good.

18:31.543 --> 18:32.311
You're lucky to
have a professional

18:32.377 --> 18:33.779
to call on for help.

18:36.000 --> 18:36.315
Actually here's this
as a thank you.

18:36.381 --> 18:39.918
For me? Thank you so much.

18:42.000 --> 18:42.488
-Jake, look.
-Well look at that.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.232

his 140 mill snips--

18:54.000 --> 18:54.800
[Jake] Are they

18:54.867 --> 18:56.935
-200 mill snips.
-Right.

18:57.436 --> 18:58.437
Hey. There you go.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.223
[Alex laughs]

19:54.000 --> 19:55.360
With ya eye patch and the leg

19:55.427 --> 19:56.929
-A pirate?
-Yep.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.268
Um, why is trouser
snake downstairs?

20:06.000 --> 20:06.672
It turns out he's
Matt's brother.

20:06.738 --> 20:09.107
-Matt's brother!
-Shhhh!

20:09.174 --> 20:10.609
[Alex laughs]

20:12.000 --> 20:13.211
[both laugh]

20:21.053 --> 20:22.988
You've made up your
mind haven't you?

20:24.323 --> 20:25.958
I'm really sorry Lauren.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.126
No, I'm sorry I was
giving you a hard time.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.461
I'd do the same to you.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.699
I really just want you to be
happy and this is wonderful,

20:36.000 --> 20:36.368
it really is,
it's a great opportunity.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.104
I mean obviously,
it's really shit for me.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.507
But, you know, I'll see
you when I come to the UK

20:42.574 --> 20:45.210
and we can FaceTime.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.181
Hm, I'm going to miss you a
lot.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.750
Please don't cry
because I'll fucking cry

20:51.817 --> 20:53.585
and I've only got
one working eye.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.924
[gentle music]

21:00.292 --> 21:02.995
-Ahhh!
-I'm sorry.

21:06.164 --> 21:07.399
Okay.

21:08.533 --> 21:09.968
Okay, what did you
want to do about that?

21:10.035 --> 21:11.970
-The Spreadsheet.
-Yeah.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.605
What you reckon?

21:13.672 --> 21:16.241
Um, well the universe does
seem to be shouting at me

21:16.308 --> 21:17.643
quite loudly right now.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.177
I think you should delete it.

21:19.244 --> 21:20.512
Um...

21:20.579 --> 21:22.347
-It's time.
-Is it?

21:22.414 --> 21:23.482
Yep, let's delete it.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.950
No, no, no, no. No!

21:25.017 --> 21:27.019
-Are you sure?
-No I'm not quitting.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.055
Maybe we can consolidate it.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.490
-Yeah, simplify it.
-Yeah.

21:31.556 --> 21:34.459
-Add a password.
-Maybe make it a league table.

21:36.028 --> 21:36.995
-Yeah.
-No.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.930
-And put them in order.
-No don't touch that.

21:42.000 --> 21:42.167
[Jake] Ah Loz, think
you've got a problem.

21:48.000 --> 21:48.006
-White ants?
-White ants.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.574
But ants?

21:50.208 --> 21:52.210
They are like termites.
Horrible things.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.247
Anyway, you can't stay here
until the inspector clears it.

21:55.313 --> 21:58.283
Right, well I guess
I'm keeping the RV.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.618
I think it will okay for you.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.888
But I think the girls should
move in with me

22:02.954 --> 22:04.022
while you get
yourself sorted.

22:06.000 --> 22:06.324
Well hang on.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.160
Well they can't
stay in a RV Loz,

22:08.226 --> 22:09.594
and this place isn't safe.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.398
Yeah, okay. Maybe for a bit.

22:14.466 --> 22:17.335
And they wanted to bring some
of their stuff anyway so.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.837
Where are you
going to stay Mum?

22:18.904 --> 22:20.372
-Ah, well, ah!
-You all right?

22:24.000 --> 22:24.176
Yes! I have got the van and
I love camping, as you know.

22:24.242 --> 22:25.143
So I'll be fine.

22:25.477 --> 22:28.613
Okay, but remember Angus can't
eat chocolate. Like, at all!

22:30.000 --> 22:30.148
-No.
-Not even if you're sharing.

22:30.215 --> 22:32.517
No not at all,
but wine's fine yeah?

22:32.784 --> 22:35.620
I'm joking. I'm joking.
I'll be fine.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.688
-Bye Mum.
-Bye darling.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.990
[Lola] Dad, this trampoline
isn't going to bounce itself.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.761
-Bye Mum. Love you till you
die. -Bye Mum.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.396
Bye.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.565
[Jake] Watch the car!

22:46.631 --> 22:47.432
[Lola] Let's hit the road.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.967
[Nancy] Come on girls.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.335
[car starts]

22:54.000 --> 22:55.107
[chicken clucks]

22:55.640 --> 22:57.909
[gentle music]

23:01.313 --> 23:03.615
I guess you're almost
a parrot aren't you?

23:08.053 --> 23:10.222
We'll be all right
won't we Angus?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.358
[chicken clucks]

23:13.425 --> 23:16.895
Hm. That was
definitely a yes.

23:18.000 --> 23:18.830
[phone chimes]

23:25.771 --> 23:26.471
[stirring music]
