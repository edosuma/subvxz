00:06.381 --> 00:07.298
(tires screech)

00:09.384 --> 00:10.802
D'oh!

00:10.885 --> 00:12.387
-Aah!
-(tires screech)

00:27.777 --> 00:30.196
Hey, Bart,
summer's almost here.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.240
Which kind of sprinkler
do you like?

00:32.323 --> 00:34.200
The one that goes
like this?

00:34.284 --> 00:35.910
Sss...
fff...

00:35.994 --> 00:37.871
sss...
fff...

00:37.954 --> 00:38.997
Or the one that goes like this?

00:39.080 --> 00:42.876
Fft-fft-fft-fft-fft-fft.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.210
Oh, and there's this one.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.422
Fff-fff-fff-fff-fff-fff.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.549
It's the last day
of school, Milhouse.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.676
Try to show
some dignity.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.680
(truck engines rev)

00:56.973 --> 00:59.225
Gentlemen, start your chimes.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.977
(chimes ringing)

01:06.274 --> 01:09.069
School's out!
Up yours, Krabappel.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.450
Well, I'm glad the rest of you
remembered that summer vacation

01:15.533 --> 01:19.079
starts at the end of
the day, not the beginning.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.663
Here you go, Ma'am.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.248
Hmm, quick work.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.917
How did you know
he was going to run?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.669
We've got someone
on the inside.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.463
(nervous laughter)

01:33.301 --> 01:38.264
Ah, the reward for a year's
worth of toil and sacrifice.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.183
Retrospecticus.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.976
Ugh...

01:43.520 --> 01:46.231
-Ooh.
-Aah.

01:46.314 --> 01:49.776
The leatheroleum covers
were worth the extra money.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.153
Oh... you can
smell the benzene.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.031
Oh, when the kids see
these layouts and fonts,

01:55.115 --> 01:58.243
you're going to be the most popular
girl in school.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.911
You know something, Beezee?

01:59.994 --> 02:02.038
I think you're right.

02:02.122 --> 02:06.209
And so, as Abraham Lincoln sat
in Ford's Theater that night,

02:06.292 --> 02:09.170
John Wilkes Booth entered,
drew his gun and...

02:09.254 --> 02:10.630
(bell ringing)

02:10.713 --> 02:13.258
Well, that's it. Have a
nice summer, everyone.

02:13.341 --> 02:16.010
But what happened
in Ford's Theater?

02:16.094 --> 02:18.096
Was President Lincoln okay?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.973
He was fine.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.435
Go home, Ralph.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.187
In the beginning
of the school year,

02:26.271 --> 02:28.481
each of you received
a colored ticket.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.483
I hope everyone
still has theirs.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.110
-No.
-No.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.195
Who died and
made you boss?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.739
Mr. Estes,
the publications advisor.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.741
I edited the whole thing.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.494
If you hadn't done it,
some other loser would have.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.121
So quit milking it.

02:44.956 --> 02:45.874
(cheering)

02:51.462 --> 02:52.922
Hey, will you guys
sign my yearbook?

03:04.100 --> 03:05.643
(sighs)

03:12.650 --> 03:13.776
This is Becky.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.403
She's in
the second grade.

03:15.486 --> 03:18.072
Hi, Becky.
Thanks for coming out.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.701
"See ya."

03:21.784 --> 03:24.162
He writes the way
people talk.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.041
Your daughter
is named Seymour?

03:28.124 --> 03:31.336
Well, I... ye...

03:31.419 --> 03:33.504
I lied. It's for me.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.133
I don't get it.
Straight A's,

03:37.217 --> 03:39.385
perfect attendance,
bathroom timer.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.639
I should be the most
popular girl in school.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.099
(sighs)

03:45.183 --> 03:48.353
Homer, I'm in a rhubarb
of a pickle of a jam here.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.271
I was all set to go off
on vacation

03:50.355 --> 03:52.273
when I get called up
for jury duty.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.108
It's a corker of a case.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.736
Seems a man drove up
onto a traffic island

03:56.819 --> 03:59.113
and hit a decorative rowboat
full of geraniums.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.699
Now they're trying it
as a maritime offense...

04:01.783 --> 04:05.245
So, anyhoo, how'd you like
to use my beach house?

04:05.328 --> 04:06.496
Free of charge.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.249
I only get two weeks
of vacation a year,

04:09.332 --> 04:12.627
and you want me to spend it
in your lousy beach house?

04:12.710 --> 04:15.630
Well... if it will
seal the deal,

04:15.713 --> 04:17.840
I'll take a look
at your septic tank,

04:17.924 --> 04:19.509
see if I can get her
humming again?

04:19.592 --> 04:22.011
Deal. See Flanders? You give
a little, you get a little.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.639
(squishing)

04:24.722 --> 04:27.183
Hello, Mr. Brown Ground.
What you got for me?

04:27.267 --> 04:30.395
MARGE: And you're sure the
Flanderses won't be there?

04:30.478 --> 04:32.772
Well, it sounds great.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.732
Bart, you can
invite Milhouse.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.318
Lisa, you can
bring a friend, too.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.779
Hey, great, a friend...

04:39.862 --> 04:43.157
or a companion...

04:43.241 --> 04:44.951
or, I don't know,
a stuffed animal.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.247
Well, did you call
one of your friends?

04:49.330 --> 04:50.581
Friends? Ha.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.125
These are
my only friends.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.961
Grown-up nerds
like Gore Vidal.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.588
And even he's kissed
more boys than I ever will.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.840
Girls, Lisa.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.967
Boys kiss girls.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.594
Mom, why don't I have
any friends?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.013
We have each other.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.431
When I was
a lonely little girl,

05:06.514 --> 05:07.890
I always dreamed
that someday

05:07.974 --> 05:11.644
my daughter would be
my best friend.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.521
We are best friends, Mom.

05:13.604 --> 05:14.814
But I'm a kid.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.816
I need friends
my own age, too.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.943
Honey, you'll make
plenty of friends.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.404
All you have to do
is be yourself.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.824
Be myself?

05:24.907 --> 05:26.993
I've been myself for eight
years and it hasn't worked.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.995
Look at all these
dorky clothes.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.830
A bathing cap...

05:30.913 --> 05:32.749
nose plugs...

05:32.832 --> 05:34.834
a microscope at the beach?

05:34.917 --> 05:36.919
Ugh, what was I thinking?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.968
Mom, I'm gonna tighten
Milhouse's straps.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.178
He's fidgeting again.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.304
Ow!

05:46.387 --> 05:49.682
-(honking)
-Lisa! Let's go.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.227
Hmm...

05:53.311 --> 05:55.063
Somebody's traveling light.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.231
Maybe you're getting stronger.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.859
Well, I have been
eating more.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.199
Wave bye-bye
to our house, Maggie.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.867
Bye-bye, tree.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.243
Bye-bye, job.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.787
Bye-bye, toothbrush.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.997
Bye-bye, Lisa Simpson.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.173
When the hell are we
going to get to...

06:22.256 --> 06:23.257
Where the hell are we going?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.009
(annoyed grunt)

06:25.093 --> 06:28.096
It's called Little
Pwagmattasquarmsettport.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.765
It's known
as America's scrod basket.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.267
I thought Springfield
was America's scrod basket.

06:33.351 --> 06:36.521
No. Springfield
is America's crud bucket.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.898
At least,
according to Newsweek.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.744
"Wel-diddly-elcome,
Simpsons."

06:51.828 --> 06:52.954
Oh, geez.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.539
He actually
wrote "diddly."

06:54.622 --> 06:55.915
That was thoughtful.

06:55.998 --> 06:59.794
"I left a few helpful
notes around our house."

06:59.877 --> 07:01.504
HOMER: Aw, come on-- Gee--

07:04.048 --> 07:05.425
"Put food in me."

07:05.508 --> 07:06.676
I'll take that.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.056
Well, duh!

07:12.140 --> 07:13.349
With what, Ned?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.725
(annoyed groan)

07:21.607 --> 07:23.234
Nice try, Todd.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.902
(chuckles)

07:24.986 --> 07:26.654
Isn't this fun, honey?

07:26.737 --> 07:29.615
It must be exciting
to make a different set of beds.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.285
I know you're
joking, but it is!

07:32.368 --> 07:34.120
Say, why don't you
put on your swimsuit

07:34.203 --> 07:35.496
and head for the beach?

07:35.580 --> 07:37.081
Well, it's kind of funny.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.542
With all the craziness
and confusion

07:39.625 --> 07:42.670
and mishegoss of packing,
I forgot to pack.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.881
Lisa, that's not
at all like you.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.007
Exactly.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.008
Hmm.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.968
I forgot my swimsuit, too

07:49.051 --> 07:51.262
but I improvised.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.598
HOMER:
Hello.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.433
(siren wailing)

07:59.479 --> 08:01.522
Uh, Mom, I'm kind
of trying to go

08:01.606 --> 08:03.441
for a different
look this year.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.734
Oh, okay.

08:04.817 --> 08:05.860
(gasps)

08:05.943 --> 08:07.028
Ooh!

08:07.111 --> 08:09.906
How about this
adorable sunsuit?

08:09.989 --> 08:11.782
It has a starfish
on the fanny

08:11.866 --> 08:13.910
and it comes
with its own pail.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.704
LISA: Mom, come here!
Bring money.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.795
So, where do you want
to show off your new hip togs?

08:24.879 --> 08:27.340
The Sherbet Shoppe?
The Candle District?

08:27.423 --> 08:29.425
Big Sue's Tap Water Taffy?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.136
Um, if it's okay
with you, Mom,

08:32.220 --> 08:34.472
I'd rather go
find some kids.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.807
Oh.
Okay.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.937
You'll be my friend.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.856
I'm never, never going
to let you get away.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.068
(laughing)

08:47.151 --> 08:49.654
BART: Last one in
is a yearbook editor!

08:49.737 --> 08:52.990
Full speed ahead.
Prepare to dive.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.200
Dive!

08:54.283 --> 08:55.701
(both groan)

08:57.703 --> 08:59.121
It's low tide, boys.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.630
I wonder where
all the kids are.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.466
Hey, a library!

09:10.550 --> 09:12.051
No, I can't.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.803
That's the old nerdy Lisa.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.474
Lisa, read about
my adventures in the south seas

09:18.558 --> 09:21.227
and make me live again.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.939
We've got periodicals
on microfiche.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.151
Won't you join
our tea party?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.195
It would be ever so...

09:31.279 --> 09:33.698
Don't do it, Lisa!
It's a trick. Run!

09:33.781 --> 09:35.032
Run!

09:37.785 --> 09:40.621
Oh, I don't see
any kids at all.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.999
It's like they ditched me
in advance.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.418
BOY:
So, he goes like (snorts).

09:45.501 --> 09:48.504
GIRL: I can totally
hear him going that.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.966
(gasps)
Only kids are that incoherent.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.677
(kids chuckling)

09:57.680 --> 09:59.807
So my Mom tried to take me
to some candle place,

09:59.890 --> 10:01.350
but I'm all, like, "no way."

10:04.562 --> 10:06.522
Like, you know, whatever.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.649
Like, you know,
whatever.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.192
Hey, what's hap...

10:10.276 --> 10:11.611
(screeching)

10:11.694 --> 10:13.279
Okay, okay, okay.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.072
Not your fault.
It's a bird thing.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.574
You don't control the birds.

10:16.657 --> 10:19.577
You will someday, but not now.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.370
-Hi.
-What's up?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.873
-Who's that?
-I don't know. Some kid.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.416
Hey, I like your hat.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.251
A compliment!

10:27.335 --> 10:29.545
<i>Scanning for sarcasm...</i>

10:29.629 --> 10:31.130
<i>It's clean. Go!</i>

10:32.340 --> 10:34.300
Thanks.

10:34.383 --> 10:37.178
Um... you guys skate?

10:37.261 --> 10:40.348
Try to, but cops always
confiscate our boards.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.600
Yeah. And you just know
they're using them

10:42.683 --> 10:45.186
like, five minutes later
down at the station.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.271
Hmm. I think I know
a place you can skate

10:47.355 --> 10:48.648
that's virtually deserted.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.527
Like, you know, whatever.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.821
-Oh, cool.
-All right. Cool.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.328
Hey, this place rocks.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.537
What'd you say
your name was?

11:03.621 --> 11:06.374
-Didn't. It's Lisa.
-I'm Erin.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.416
So how'd you know
about this place?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.377
You into books?

11:09.460 --> 11:11.379
Me? Unlikely.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.006
My goony brother's
always going to libraries.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.133
I usually hang out in front.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.885
Oh, you like hanging out, too?

11:17.968 --> 11:19.970
Well, it beats doing stuff.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.139
Yeah, stuff sucks.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.517
Hey, you up?
You can use my board.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.601
Aah!

11:25.685 --> 11:27.770
Okay. Thanks.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.647
That's very, um...

11:29.730 --> 11:31.190
rad of you.

11:37.988 --> 11:41.117
Hey, Bart, Lisa's skateboarding
with some cool kids.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.869
And she looks like Blossom.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.373
Lisa? With people?
(snorts)

11:47.456 --> 11:48.791
If they're
impressed by her,

11:48.874 --> 11:50.626
I'm going to Bart
their world.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.044
Okay, Milhouse,
you know the drill.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.088
Right. You go over
and wow them.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.923
I hide in the shrubs.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.845
Hot stuff coming through!

12:04.724 --> 12:07.977
My friendship,
you know you want it.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.855
(scoffs) That kid, like,
tries too hard.

12:10.938 --> 12:14.984
Shah. The whole thing
smacks of effort, man.

12:15.067 --> 12:19.488
Pff. That's my dorky little brother,
Bart... tholomew.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.323
(scoffs) Like, who does
he think he is

12:21.407 --> 12:22.533
with that slingshot
in his back pocket?

12:22.616 --> 12:23.826
Dennis the Menace?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.286
-(all laughing)
-Face. What a rip!

12:25.369 --> 12:27.246
Like, Mr. Wilson
or something.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.040
How'd it go?
Are we down with them?

12:30.124 --> 12:32.793
No. They must
have seen you.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.254
(bug zapper zaps)

12:35.337 --> 12:38.090
Oh, why do we have to play
this lousy old game?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.384
Because it was
the only one in the house.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.179
Come on, Homer, open the door
for your mystery date.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.141
Ooh captain of
the football team!

12:47.224 --> 12:49.018
He's a dreamboat.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.394
Don't wait up, Marge.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.937
(chuckles)

12:52.021 --> 12:53.272
Okay, Bart, your turn, your turn.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.694
(Marge laughing)

12:58.778 --> 13:01.697
You got the dud!

13:01.781 --> 13:04.784
Hey, he looks just
like you, Poindexter.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.076
(guffawing)

13:06.160 --> 13:08.120
How come Lisa
doesn't have to play?

13:08.204 --> 13:10.372
Why does she get to hang out
with her friends?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.666
You got friends.
You got the dud right here.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.502
Stand up for yourself,
Poindexter.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.053
Wow, Lisa,
I never appreciated

13:24.136 --> 13:26.138
all this, like,
sea junk before.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.723
Hey, that clam's got legs.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.974
That's a hermit crab.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.684
When she outgrows
her old shell,

13:30.768 --> 13:32.978
she finds a new one
that's a better fit.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.730
Don't be afraid,
little friend.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.191
You'll be the most popular
crab on the beach.

13:37.274 --> 13:41.821
Aww, a gift
from my favorite crustacean.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.990
Um, did you learn that word
from a teacher or something?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.409
No. No...

13:47.493 --> 13:49.161
I heard it
on Baywatch.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.205
(overlapping
affirmations)

13:51.288 --> 13:53.082
Baywatch...
David Hasselhoff, man.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.839
Hmm... I bet this place
sells illegal fireworks.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.759
Just go in and act casual,
like you buy 'em all the time.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.720
Hi.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.975
Um... let me have
one of those porno magazines,

14:11.058 --> 14:12.977
large box of condoms,

14:13.060 --> 14:14.645
a bottle of Old Harper,

14:14.728 --> 14:16.605
couple of those panty shields,

14:16.689 --> 14:18.399
and some illegal fireworks,

14:18.482 --> 14:20.693
and one of those
disposable enemas.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.194
No, make it two.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.406
My apologies, sir,
but the sale of fireworks

14:25.489 --> 14:27.908
is prohibited in this state
and is punishable by...

14:27.992 --> 14:30.035
Follow me.

14:34.665 --> 14:38.127
Any red-blooded,
flag-fearing American

14:38.210 --> 14:40.421
would love the M-320.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.590
Celebrate the independence
of your nation

14:42.673 --> 14:44.842
by blowing up
a small part of it.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.343
All right.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.428
Pretty cool
of your Mom

14:47.511 --> 14:48.554
to let us
hang out here.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.889
Totally. Not
like my Mom.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.223
She'd be
butting in

14:51.307 --> 14:54.476
with Rice Krispie
squares and Tang.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.020
My Dad's all stoked

14:56.103 --> 14:58.147
'cause today's
the fourth of July.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.190
He woke me up at dawn
to take a loyalty oath.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.027
Ugh. My Mom's French

15:03.110 --> 15:05.446
so we only celebrate
Bastille Day.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.239
Well, we could do
something fun.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.825
Um, how about
a beach party?

15:09.909 --> 15:10.910
Oh, great idea, Lis.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.369
I know where there's a beach.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.246
I know where we can
get some baguettes.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.708
Gee, I don't know
what you've got planned

15:17.791 --> 15:19.960
for tonight, Homer,
but count me out.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.129
Didn't you buy any meat?

15:22.212 --> 15:23.213
(chuckles)

15:23.297 --> 15:25.382
This baby's sure
to kill something.

15:25.466 --> 15:29.386
Okay, now, everybody, stand back
while I celebrate freedom.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.846
Bart, give me your matches.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.640
Fresh out.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.350
No lighter? Nothing?!

15:36.018 --> 15:36.977
Oh!

15:37.061 --> 15:38.395
Wait. I got it.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.401
D'oh!

15:45.569 --> 15:47.237
(gibbering)

15:51.867 --> 15:53.327
(gasps)
The beer!

15:58.540 --> 15:59.500
(sighs)

16:04.546 --> 16:06.423
(whistling)

16:08.550 --> 16:11.720
Oh, this is the worst
fourth of July ever.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.138
I hate America.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.556
Come on, Milhouse.
Let's go down there.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.225
I don't think you should.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.686
Let Lisa be alone
with her new friends.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.771
They're my friends rightfully.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.147
She only got them
by copying me.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.857
Don't have
a cow, man.

16:23.941 --> 16:24.858
(all laughing)

16:24.942 --> 16:26.360
See? That's
my expression.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.320
Oh, you haven't said that
in four years.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.114
Let Lisa have it.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.658
It's the principle.
She's got to learn.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.411
No! Now, park your keister,
Meester.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.581
LISA:
Aye, carumba!

16:39.665 --> 16:40.916
(kids laugh)

16:42.751 --> 16:45.129
Hey, Lis, I made
something for you.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.964
It's a friendship
bracelet.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.632
For me?

16:48.716 --> 16:52.469
Wow, my first real
friend... ship bracelet.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.595
(nervous chuckle)

16:53.679 --> 16:55.764
I don't have
anything for you...

16:55.848 --> 16:57.975
except this necklace I made.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.268
Oh, cool.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.519
Thanks.

17:00.602 --> 17:01.520
(sniffing)

17:01.603 --> 17:03.313
Hey, cinnamon dental floss.

17:03.397 --> 17:07.484
I just know we're going
to be friends forever.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.490
So, Lisa has a friend.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.617
We'll see about that.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.454
Bart!

17:18.537 --> 17:20.664
I need my glasses.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.542
Oh, nice doggie.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.340
(giggling)

17:35.429 --> 17:37.431
<i>I'm dizzy!</i>

17:37.514 --> 17:39.224
<i>I'm nauseous!</i>

17:39.308 --> 17:41.101
<i>But I'm popular!</i>

17:45.355 --> 17:46.899
Huh?

17:46.982 --> 17:48.817
What's he doing here?

17:48.901 --> 17:49.985
My yearbook.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.028
No!

17:52.154 --> 17:54.448
Mm-hmm.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.616
Hey, you guys,
you want to see

17:55.699 --> 17:57.367
how cool Lisa Simpson
really is?

17:58.952 --> 18:01.747
Check this out.
"Miss Perfect Attendance."

18:01.830 --> 18:04.249
"Grammar Rodeo--
Head Buckeroo."

18:04.333 --> 18:06.960
"The French table."
Ooh la la.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.132
"Teacher's Pet"?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.305
(sobbing)

18:21.558 --> 18:23.227
(humming)

18:24.686 --> 18:27.064
Hey, Lis.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.149
I guess my little
yearbook stunt

18:29.233 --> 18:30.984
was pretty rough,

18:31.068 --> 18:33.153
but it did
teach you a lesson.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.030
It's important
to be yourself.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.408
(through clenched teeth)
I know exactly who I am.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.035
I am the sister

18:40.119 --> 18:43.288
of a rotten, jealous,
mean little sneak.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.666
You cost me
my only friends.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.335
You've ruined my life.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.588
Hey, kids, there's
a carnival tonight.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.966
Oh, boy, a carnival!

19:01.932 --> 19:03.100
Hmm.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.686
(choking)

19:05.769 --> 19:07.271
Kids, stop that.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.939
Don't make me get the carny.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.696
Hey, Lisa,
make friends with this.

19:15.779 --> 19:16.947
Hey!

19:18.782 --> 19:20.742
MILHOUSE:
Help!

19:20.826 --> 19:22.536
Help!

19:22.619 --> 19:25.789
Remember, kids,
there's no need to bump.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.332
Just enjoy the ride.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.627
(bell rings)

19:30.711 --> 19:32.504
(electrical crackling)

19:46.268 --> 19:48.020
(sighs)

19:52.065 --> 19:53.567
Lisa, wait!

19:58.572 --> 20:00.741
Being myself didn't work.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.285
Being someone else didn't work.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.163
Maybe I just wasn't meant
to have friends.

20:06.246 --> 20:09.041
BOY: Lisa is gonna freak
when she sees this.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.084
ERIN: Well, hurry up.
They'll be back soon.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.255
(gasps) Lisa.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.966
Okay, you found out
I'm an overachieving bookworm.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.385
So whatever mean prank
you're pulling,

20:20.469 --> 20:22.638
just finish it up
and send me a Polaroid.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.181
I'm going to sleep.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.474
BOY:
Wait, Lisa, look.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.062
Hmm?

20:30.145 --> 20:33.565
(Lisa exclaiming)

20:33.649 --> 20:35.234
Cool, huh?

20:35.317 --> 20:37.861
Now you can take the beach with you
wherever you go.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.405
Uh, but don't drive
at night.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.075
Does this mean you still
want to be friends?

20:43.158 --> 20:46.245
Even though I tried to
cover up my nerdish leanings?

20:46.328 --> 20:48.914
Look, we don't care
who you were,

20:48.997 --> 20:51.959
and you can't fake the kind
of good person that you are.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.212
Yeah. You taught us
about cool things like nature

20:55.295 --> 20:57.965
and why we shouldn't
drink sea water.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.300
This is the most thoughtful
thing anybody ever--

21:00.384 --> 21:02.344
HOMER:
Sweet merciful crap!

21:02.427 --> 21:03.971
My car!

21:04.054 --> 21:05.180
(sea gulls shrieking)

21:06.765 --> 21:09.059
Mmm. The polite thing to do

21:09.142 --> 21:10.978
would have been to clean
the shells first.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.938
Shoo. Shoo.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.023
I guess I should
give this back to you.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.317
I showed it to your friends again
before we left.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.360
Bart!

21:18.443 --> 21:19.695
Look inside.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.245
Oh, thanks, Bart.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.164
I signed it, too.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.249
(goofy laughter)

21:33.250 --> 21:35.711
Uh-huh.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.007
Well, get a last look

21:40.090 --> 21:42.301
at the beautiful
ocean scenery, kids.
