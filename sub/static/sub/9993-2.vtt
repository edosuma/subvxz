WEBVTT

00:08.053 --> 00:09.030
...how you did me wrong

00:09.081 --> 00:09.929
But I grew strong

00:10.403 --> 00:12.340
And I learned how to get along

00:12.391 --> 00:15.618
And so you're back from outer space

00:16.372 --> 00:18.345
I just walked in to find you here

00:18.396 --> 00:20.252
With that sad look upon your face

00:20.303 --> 00:22.487
I should have changed that stupid lock

00:22.538 --> 00:24.630
I should have made you leave your key

00:24.681 --> 00:26.820
If I'd have known for just one second

00:26.871 --> 00:28.559
You'd be back to bother me

00:28.722 --> 00:32.311
Go on, now, go, walk out the door

00:32.800 --> 00:34.654
Just turn around now

00:35.043 --> 00:37.229
because you're not welcome anymore

00:37.975 --> 00:41.236
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with good-bye?

00:41.409 --> 00:42.780
Did you think I'd crumble?

00:43.258 --> 00:45.208
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

00:45.259 --> 00:46.567
Oh, no, not I

00:47.243 --> 00:48.675
I will survive

00:49.392 --> 00:51.798
Oh, as long as I know how to love

00:51.849 --> 00:53.461
I know I'll stay alive

00:53.644 --> 00:55.463
I've got all my life to live

00:55.524 --> 00:57.428
I've got all my love to give

00:57.652 --> 00:59.123
And I'll survive

00:59.577 --> 01:02.713
I will survive, hey, hey

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

And I learned how to get along

01:18.262 --> 01:21.416
And so you're back from outer space

01:22.235 --> 01:24.024
I just walked in to find you here

01:24.075 --> 01:26.152
With that sad look upon your face

01:26.203 --> 01:28.281
I should have changed that stupid lock...

01:28.371 --> 01:30.207
What... What's the deal?

01:30.701 --> 01:32.420
If I'd have known for just one second...

01:32.471 --> 01:34.063
Why didn't you wake me?

01:34.612 --> 01:35.905
Go on, now, go

01:36.142 --> 01:36.837
Guys?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.174
Walk out the door...

01:38.782 --> 01:41.239
It's ten after 7:00!
It's a school day.

01:41.620 --> 01:42.767
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

01:43.158 --> 01:44.139
Is that us?

01:44.190 --> 01:45.395
Weren't you the one who tried...

01:45.446 --> 01:47.074
Is that coming from here?

01:47.660 --> 01:48.962
Do you believe this?

01:49.013 --> 01:49.630
Huh?

01:57.093 --> 01:58.380
Why didn't you wake me?

02:02.260 --> 02:02.951
What?

02:03.178 --> 02:04.255
Is that the neighbors?

02:06.012 --> 02:06.815
I will survive...

02:06.866 --> 02:08.113
Do you not hear that?

02:09.667 --> 02:10.937
That song!

03:13.289 --> 03:15.370
I should have changed that stupid lock...

03:15.421 --> 03:17.182
No! I told you,
I'm not all right!

03:17.233 --> 03:18.618
I've got a song in my head!

03:18.990 --> 03:20.579
It's really hard to hear.

03:27.822 --> 03:29.321
No, it's not an expression.

03:29.372 --> 03:33.500
I have a real song in my head,
and it's loud, and it's hard to hear.

03:34.446 --> 03:35.465
What time is it?

03:36.827 --> 03:38.547
I got to get the girls to school.

03:47.433 --> 03:49.299
Okay, if you could take the girls to school,

03:49.350 --> 03:50.990
I will drive over to the university,

03:51.041 --> 03:53.141
and see if I can find that Dr. Cardwell.

03:53.324 --> 03:55.638
You know the one who helped me with that train dream.

03:57.565 --> 03:58.752
It's a song.

03:59.510 --> 04:01.318
It-It's not like I can't see.

04:01.782 --> 04:03.168
Just take the girls.

04:47.225 --> 04:49.209
I'm sorry.
I'm not from around here.

05:00.774 --> 05:02.094
Weren't you the one who tried

05:02.145 --> 05:03.735
to break me with good-bye?

05:03.786 --> 05:05.027
Did you think I'd crumble?

05:05.955 --> 05:07.595
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

05:07.807 --> 05:09.946
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,

05:09.997 --> 05:12.052
no, no, no...

05:15.780 --> 05:16.999
Go on, now, go...

05:17.088 --> 05:18.083
Go on, now, go...

05:18.134 --> 05:19.270
Go on, now, go...

05:19.321 --> 05:20.413
Go on, now, go...

05:20.798 --> 05:22.838
No, no, no, no, no,

05:22.889 --> 05:24.737
no, no, no, no...

05:25.554 --> 05:26.671
Go on, now, go...

05:26.722 --> 05:27.691
Go on, now, go...

05:27.742 --> 05:28.810
Go on, now, go...

05:28.881 --> 05:30.046
Go on, now go...

05:37.436 --> 05:38.782
No, no, no, no,

05:38.833 --> 05:43.002
no, no, no, no, no...

05:43.752 --> 05:44.696
Go on, now, go...

05:44.747 --> 05:46.013
Go on, now, go...

05:46.078 --> 05:47.197
Go on, now, go...

05:47.334 --> 05:49.515
Go on, now, go...

05:54.109 --> 05:56.052
No, no, no, no, no,

05:56.103 --> 05:58.004
no, no, no, no, no...

05:58.270 --> 05:59.519
Go  on, now, go...

05:59.826 --> 06:01.253
Go on, now, go...

06:01.791 --> 06:03.673
No, no, no, no, no,

06:03.724 --> 06:04.987
no, no, no, no...

06:05.068 --> 06:05.926
Go on, now, go...

06:05.977 --> 06:08.013
Go on, now, go...

06:08.662 --> 06:11.416
Go, go, go, go, go,

06:11.467 --> 06:15.884
go, go, go, go, go...

06:36.704 --> 06:37.880
Oh, my God.

06:40.403 --> 06:41.807
How do you spell it again?

06:41.973 --> 06:43.950
Wedding: W-E-D-D-I-N-G.

06:44.001 --> 06:44.987
Slower!

06:45.529 --> 06:47.207
Bridgette, I'm doing something.

06:47.258 --> 06:48.149
Mom.

06:48.536 --> 06:49.893
Bridge, okay...

06:50.476 --> 06:51.331
Let's sound it out.

06:51.392 --> 06:52.977
Wedding. Wed...

06:53.997 --> 06:54.853
What does that start with?

06:54.971 --> 06:56.949
I don't know.
Can't you just spell it?

06:58.715 --> 07:00.112
Joe, could you get that?

07:00.163 --> 07:02.972
I think it's the District Attorney's, and I'm all greasy.

07:05.208 --> 07:06.745
Great job. We're going to drive all the way

07:06.796 --> 07:09.561
to Salt Lake City, so you can wish Aunt Amanda happy weeding.

07:09.612 --> 07:11.077
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah, she's right here.

07:11.236 --> 07:14.230
District Attorney Devalos requesting a word.

07:14.409 --> 07:16.571
- Hello?
- No, I didn't. I spelled it right.

07:16.688 --> 07:19.049
- Bridgette, you spelled it wrong.
- Can you hold on a second?

07:19.100 --> 07:19.911
Back off!

07:20.454 --> 07:21.919
- You spelled it wrong.
- Nuh-uh.

07:21.970 --> 07:25.435
- All right, girls, keep it down, huh?
- Bridgette, come on, you spelled it wrong. Look.

07:25.486 --> 07:26.466
Shut up.

07:26.517 --> 07:27.485
I'm back.

07:29.956 --> 07:31.272
Everything  all right there?

07:31.665 --> 07:34.493
Ah, you talking about that blissful silence?

07:34.544 --> 07:36.242
- Girls, hey!|- Isn't it wonderful?

07:36.815 --> 07:37.951
Well, if you say so.

07:38.002 --> 07:39.571
I'm just calling to give you an update.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.686
Forensics is still examining the music player you brought in.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.608
The blood does appear to be Isabel Navarro's.

07:46.448 --> 07:48.794
We canvassed her dorm, talked to about 30 students.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.570
Turns out she's only been missing since yesterday.

07:52.112 --> 07:55.961
Very religious girl. She went to mass Sunday morning, had lunch with two friends,

07:56.012 --> 07:57.459
then she went for a run.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.720
No one has seen her since.

07:59.089 --> 08:01.716
So, really she's been missing less than 24 hours.

08:02.082 --> 08:02.974
Exactly.

08:03.326 --> 08:05.412
She probably wouldn't even be on our radar yet

08:05.463 --> 08:07.321
if you hadn't stumbled across that iPod.

08:09.098 --> 08:10.836
Hmm. Well, we're gonna find her before Friday.

08:11.191 --> 08:15.587
Well, that's great, but, uh, how can you be so sure?

08:15.688 --> 08:20.282
Because Friday morning I am going to Salt Lake City with Joe and the girls.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.147
Leave on some family trip somewhere, right?

08:22.244 --> 08:23.633
It's very exciting.

08:23.948 --> 08:26.839
Joe's sister is getting married for the third time.

08:27.092 --> 08:28.513
Well, practice makes perfect.

08:32.621 --> 08:33.301
Hi.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.693
Where's Daddy
and Bridgette?

08:36.313 --> 08:37.909
Huh? Oh, she needed a time out.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.503
What? Why?

08:39.756 --> 08:41.640
She doesn't respond well to criticism.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.123
Criticism or sarcasm?

08:47.579 --> 08:48.622
- Hey, what's that?
- What?

08:48.673 --> 08:50.326
That banner.
Click on that.

08:53.253 --> 08:55.434
This Website has airline tickets from Phoenix

08:55.485 --> 08:57.920
to Salt Lake City for $99.

08:58.633 --> 09:00.725
Joe! Joe!

09:01.455 --> 09:02.805
Secret confession?

09:04.464 --> 09:07.284
The thought of being in that car with the kids for ten hours driving

09:07.335 --> 09:09.248
to Salt Lake City... Ugh!

09:09.348 --> 09:10.683
I like planes.

09:10.997 --> 09:12.329
Planes are fast!

09:12.722 --> 09:16.059
Nobody fights about who's going to roll down their window, or where we're gonna stop for lunch.

09:16.110 --> 09:17.221
I like planes.

09:18.067 --> 09:18.985
Somebody's giddy.

09:19.515 --> 09:20.390
Guess what I like.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.623
Hey, guess what I like.

09:23.447 --> 09:24.219
Planes?

09:38.436 --> 09:40.062
Come on, don't do this.

09:44.006 --> 09:47.234
Come on, not here, not now.

10:29.801 --> 10:31.432
You want me to cancel the tickets

10:32.771 --> 10:35.353
I mean... I'm not sure if I can.
I don't know if they'll let me.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.379
Frankly, I don't really want to.

10:39.812 --> 10:41.930
Look, let's just, can we talk about this dream for a second?

10:41.981 --> 10:43.965
I mean, it's not like you were on the plane.

10:44.462 --> 10:46.493
If I understood you correctly, in this dream,

10:47.317 --> 10:48.860
you were standing on the ground.

10:49.211 --> 10:50.017
Have I got that right?

10:50.283 --> 10:51.117
Yeah.

10:51.426 --> 10:52.191
Okay, then.

10:53.232 --> 10:55.746
You know at the end of the day, I'm gonna do what you want.

10:56.370 --> 10:58.717
I'm just not sure that it makes sense to be afraid of flying

10:58.768 --> 11:01.395
if you're standing on the ground and a plane falls on you.

11:02.059 --> 11:04.914
I mean, you might never want to walk down a country road again...

11:05.094 --> 11:06.056
Are you making fun of me?

11:06.328 --> 11:08.068
Not on purpose, no.

11:10.746 --> 11:13.308
Most people, you'd say, sleep on it.

11:15.707 --> 11:17.677
Can we see how you feel at the end of the day?

11:21.594 --> 11:22.871
Copying anything important?

11:27.439 --> 11:29.289
A Happy Weeding card.

11:30.368 --> 11:32.477
Supposed to be Happy Wedding.

11:32.891 --> 11:34.499
My daughter wanted me to fix it,

11:34.550 --> 11:36.978
so I thought I'd try to copy it and cut and paste...

11:37.916 --> 11:39.374
It's not important.

11:39.734 --> 11:40.986
Uh, do you need me?

11:42.704 --> 11:45.759
Señor Navarro. Esta la señora de quien hable.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.554
Allison Dubois, this is Jorge Navarro,

11:48.605 --> 11:50.046
he's the father of the young woman,

11:50.097 --> 11:51.872
whose  music player you found yesterday.

11:52.448 --> 11:53.636
And this is Father Santiago,

11:53.704 --> 11:55.615
he's the priest at Isabel's parish...

11:55.727 --> 11:57.217
- Thank you.
- No.

11:57.326 --> 11:58.894
There's no reason to thank me.

11:58.945 --> 12:00.069
Really, I didn't do anything.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.582
I-I just was going to the doctor,

12:01.633 --> 12:03.151
and I saw something in the dirt...

12:03.206 --> 12:04.012
My  Isabel?

12:04.426 --> 12:06.726
She's a good girl, a good student.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.832
When she didn't call me Sunday night, I called the police.

12:11.016 --> 12:13.618
I told them, "You have to look for my baby,"

12:14.066 --> 12:15.460
but they said "Wait."

12:15.794 --> 12:17.355
They wouldn't even start looking.

12:18.046 --> 12:20.447
Not until you found her radio...

12:23.082 --> 12:25.890
The Navarros have been a part of our parish as long as I can remember,

12:25.941 --> 12:29.368
ever since Jorge here came to this country 14 years ago.

12:30.214 --> 12:32.604
We're all praying that Isabel is returned to us very soon.

12:33.457 --> 12:35.960
Anything you need, meeting rooms,

12:36.558 --> 12:38.466
volunteers for search parties,

12:38.929 --> 12:40.091
our church stands ready.

12:40.190 --> 12:41.395
We appreciate that.

12:41.808 --> 12:44.754
We hope, of course, it's not necessary, but we do appreciate it.

12:45.695 --> 12:49.513
Señor... estamos haciendo todo lo que podemos

12:49.564 --> 12:51.993
para segurar la vuelta de su hija, okay?

12:52.058 --> 12:52.893
Gracias.

12:53.412 --> 12:55.550
Father, thank you for bringing Mr. Navarro.

12:55.910 --> 12:57.148
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. District Attorney.

12:57.199 --> 12:57.799
Un placer.

12:58.291 --> 12:58.891
Thank you very much.

12:58.932 --> 13:00.265
Weren't you the one...?

13:01.355 --> 13:03.273
- Allison?|- Weren't you the one?

13:03.324 --> 13:06.141
- Ms. Dubois, are you okay?|- Weren't you the one?

13:06.941 --> 13:09.447
- Ms. Dubois?|- Allison?

13:10.173 --> 13:11.231
Mrs. Dubois?

13:12.124 --> 13:13.304
Yes. I'm sorry.

13:13.355 --> 13:14.934
I don't know what happened there.

13:15.542 --> 13:18.539
I just went away for a minute...

13:18.730 --> 13:21.629
But I'm back. I'm fine.

13:21.853 --> 13:22.637
You sure?

13:22.853 --> 13:24.123
Yeah, I'm positive.

13:25.231 --> 13:26.189
Señores?

13:38.264 --> 13:39.273
He's involved in this.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.471
Mr. Navarro? Her father?

13:42.872 --> 13:44.311
I'm talking about the priest.

13:45.347 --> 13:50.236
Father Santiago? I don't think so.

13:51.281 --> 13:53.094
Allison, the man is a Catholic priest...

13:53.276 --> 13:55.324
You don't want to hear what I have to say on that subject.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.427
Not to mention the factthat he has a rock solid alibi

13:57.478 --> 13:59.766
for the two hour period when Isabel went for her run.

13:59.817 --> 14:00.732
How rock solid?

14:00.783 --> 14:01.833
He was teaching Bible class

14:02.095 --> 14:05.603
which means there's at least 15 people that can swear to his whereabouts.

14:05.654 --> 14:08.098
And he's a Catholic priest.

14:08.657 --> 14:10.648
I'm sorry, but that still means something to me.

14:11.087 --> 14:12.535
Well, I didn't mean to offend you.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.778
And we happen to live in a city where it still means something

14:14.829 --> 14:17.451
to a fairly considerable proportion of the population.

14:18.060 --> 14:20.313
And, lest you forget, I'm an elected official.

14:20.661 --> 14:23.443
So unless and until you have something that trumps the fact

14:23.494 --> 14:26.255
that he can prove he wasn't anywhere near where you found that iPod,

14:26.306 --> 14:28.540
I'm going to let the good father continue on his way.

14:31.096 --> 14:32.946
I'm sure he wasn't actually angry at you.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.564
I don't know, he seemed pretty upset.

14:35.117 --> 14:37.476
Well, come on, it is a fairly outrageous assertion.

14:37.856 --> 14:39.364
Why?  He's just a man.

14:39.662 --> 14:42.756
He's a priest, Allison. He's a Catholic priest.

14:42.866 --> 14:44.823
And if he's serious about his faith, he's made some

14:44.874 --> 14:48.071
fairly extraordinary sacrifices to serve his fellow man.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.476
Well, I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you.

14:50.527 --> 14:53.792
There was nothing vague about the sensation I experienced when I shook his hand.

14:54.169 --> 14:56.495
I'm sure, but does that mean that he's the one who took her?

14:56.617 --> 14:58.658
Couldn't there be some other explanation for that?

14:58.709 --> 14:59.521
Like what?

14:59.947 --> 15:00.631
I don't know.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.460
Maybe he knows something, maybe...

15:05.159 --> 15:07.762
Maybe she's not the girl that we think she is.
Maybe she said something to him.

15:08.297 --> 15:09.670
Maybe she told him she was going to run away.

15:09.721 --> 15:12.861
She hated school, she hated trying to please her father.

15:13.005 --> 15:15.365
Come on, if she ran away, he would tell her dad.

15:15.746 --> 15:17.105
He'd let somebody know.

15:17.156 --> 15:18.775
He'd have to talk to the police.

15:19.354 --> 15:21.424
- He'd have to.
- I don't know, Al.

15:21.602 --> 15:22.856
People tell priests lots of things.

15:22.907 --> 15:24.449
They got to keep a lot of secrets.

15:24.734 --> 15:25.424
I don't know.

15:26.247 --> 15:28.326
Well, maybe somebody else told him something.

15:29.070 --> 15:31.972
I mean, come on, here's a guy who, every day,

15:32.024 --> 15:35.528
hears people pour out their worst behavior in the hopes of being cleansed.

15:35.579 --> 15:37.779
That's what confession is.
It's a large part of what he does.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.654
I'm just saying that there may be another reason

15:40.705 --> 15:42.531
you reacted as strongly to him as you did.

15:43.954 --> 15:46.049
I think, at the very least, you owe him a conversation.

15:47.284 --> 15:48.478
Mommy.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.597
Baby, what are you doing up?

15:51.648 --> 15:53.236
I had a bad dream.

15:53.549 --> 15:54.705
Oh, no.

15:55.167 --> 15:56.551
Come here, stinkbug.

16:06.554 --> 16:08.135
It's good talking to you.

16:32.603 --> 16:34.270
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...

16:34.861 --> 16:36.758
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...

16:37.389 --> 16:39.306
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.975
I hate my brother...

16:43.608 --> 16:46.040
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...

16:46.973 --> 16:49.794
I saw something I wasn't supposed to be...

16:50.999 --> 16:54.683
And I don't know what to do.

17:26.478 --> 17:27.599
May God, who has enlightened every heart,

17:27.651 --> 17:29.839
help you to know your sins and trust in his mercy.

17:30.088 --> 17:30.792
Amen.

17:33.344 --> 17:33.944
Hello?

17:34.321 --> 17:35.288
Hello.

17:35.414 --> 17:37.728
Um, I'm sorry, I didn't know anyone was over there.

17:37.779 --> 17:39.102
I'm very sorry.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.662
It's okay, this is a church.
Everyone is welcome here.

17:42.205 --> 17:43.379
Would you like to make confession?

17:44.799 --> 17:49.870
Uh... to be honest... uh, I don't know.

17:50.881 --> 17:52.372
Have you received Communion?

17:56.861 --> 17:58.656
I... I'm not Catholic, Father.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.003
A-ha.

18:02.154 --> 18:03.852
Well, that does pose a bit of a problem.

18:03.903 --> 18:07.054
I can't actually offer confession to someone who hasn't, uh...

18:07.448 --> 18:10.748
Oh... I-I-I understand.

18:10.799 --> 18:11.971
I'm so sorry.

18:12.022 --> 18:14.192
- I think I'm just going to...
- But I'm happy to listen.

18:16.033 --> 18:17.091
Excuse me?

18:17.443 --> 18:19.029
I can't offer you absolution,

18:19.181 --> 18:21.240
but clearly there's a reason you came here.

18:22.421 --> 18:25.604
I mean, you're not in the habit of visiting strange churches, are you?

18:25.655 --> 18:27.594
There must be something on your mind,

18:27.645 --> 18:29.009
something that drew you here...

18:31.921 --> 18:34.421
I've heard everything, I promise. You can't shock me.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.610
Well... the thing is...

18:52.788 --> 18:54.098
Someone came to me.

18:55.505 --> 18:57.279
He did a horrible thing, he...

18:58.830 --> 19:05.911
put a young woman I know in a dangerous position, maybe even killed her.

19:10.044 --> 19:12.180
I know all about it, but I can't tell anyone.

19:12.231 --> 19:14.011
Wh-What do you mean? Of course you can.

19:16.227 --> 19:17.725
I-I don't think so.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.718
I'm a priest.

19:25.428 --> 19:26.268
Miss...

19:26.604 --> 19:27.750
Isn't that the way it works?

19:28.251 --> 19:31.304
Maybe you were right. Maybe you should go.

19:31.589 --> 19:33.077
No, no, Father Santiago!

19:33.293 --> 19:36.380
I'm  someone who understands the horrible position that you're in.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.558
I have no idea what you're talking about.

19:38.660 --> 19:40.776
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

19:40.886 --> 19:43.085
I'm talking about Isabel Navarro.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.009
You know something.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.552
Something that you're not telling.

19:48.660 --> 19:50.896
Young lady, if you are suggesting

19:50.947 --> 19:54.679
that I may have heard something during confession about Isabel Navarro...

19:54.730 --> 19:55.543
I'm not suggesting...

19:55.594 --> 19:57.631
There's nothing I can do.

19:58.046 --> 19:59.433
As a fellow priest,

19:59.610 --> 20:03.111
I'm sure you know the seal of confession can't be broken.

20:04.232 --> 20:06.447
Not even if it could save a girl's life?

20:06.725 --> 20:10.577
No... not even for that.

20:11.903 --> 20:14.219
But that can't be the answer.

20:14.270 --> 20:16.146
That can't be right.

20:17.307 --> 20:23.836
Miss... when someone confesses to me, they're not talking to me.

20:23.887 --> 20:25.914
They're talking through me, directly to God.

20:26.409 --> 20:29.898
God offers them forgiveness, not me.
I can't betray that.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.604
Not for any reason, even for the life of a girl.

20:35.096 --> 20:37.070
Well, what if you didn'thave to say anything?

20:38.062 --> 20:39.827
What if you just had to think it?

20:40.819 --> 20:42.642
You just had to think about him.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.975
You just have to think about what he said.

20:46.382 --> 20:47.604
What would be the point of that?

20:48.149 --> 20:50.623
Well, the point of that might be...

20:52.666 --> 20:54.577
that it's possible that I...

20:57.286 --> 20:59.646
that I could hear your thoughts.

21:02.925 --> 21:04.489
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,

21:04.540 --> 21:06.217
and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning...

21:06.268 --> 21:06.885
Father?

21:06.936 --> 21:09.153
...and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

21:09.204 --> 21:09.942
No, Father!

21:09.993 --> 21:10.984
Father, please!

21:11.678 --> 21:13.400
I'm going to leave you my phone number.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.949
Call me. Maybe we can figure out a way we can help this girl.

21:17.459 --> 21:18.872
Please.

21:27.361 --> 21:30.420
I - I gotta get up at five, get into work early.

21:31.608 --> 21:34.711
I'm behind on the McCarthy thing and if we're still gonna leave on Friday...

21:34.914 --> 21:36.150
We're still gonna leave on Friday.

21:37.272 --> 21:38.485
By whatever conveyance.

21:39.839 --> 21:42.813
We're flying, we're flying, we're flying.

21:43.149 --> 21:43.827
Excellent.

21:44.808 --> 21:47.047
And I promise not to make you walk down any country roads.

21:49.189 --> 21:49.977
Oh, shoot!

21:52.097 --> 21:53.016
Was it something I said?

21:53.326 --> 21:54.306
I'll be right back.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.261
Honey, it's 11:20.

22:04.236 --> 22:05.369
I know.

22:06.644 --> 22:08.543
Do you still think he's really gonna call?

22:09.158 --> 22:10.274
I don't know.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.903
It's just, she's still out there, Joe.

22:16.728 --> 22:18.160
I just can't give up.

23:34.181 --> 23:36.614
Joe!

23:37.577 --> 23:38.778
Joe...

23:39.664 --> 23:41.963
I had another bad dream.

23:42.262 --> 23:43.344
Where's Daddy?

23:44.287 --> 23:45.993
He had to go to work early.

23:46.413 --> 23:47.270
You okay?

23:52.314 --> 23:53.054
Hi.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.197
It's the chicken delivery man.

23:57.881 --> 23:59.020
Anybody home?

24:00.024 --> 24:00.782
Hi.

24:01.707 --> 24:02.584
No hi?

24:03.757 --> 24:04.491
Hi!

24:05.272 --> 24:06.638
What's the rush?

24:06.914 --> 24:08.084
Gettin' ready!

24:08.644 --> 24:09.805
Gettin' ready?

24:11.357 --> 24:12.398
For what?

24:14.325 --> 24:16.893
Hey, someone's all nice and clean.

24:17.058 --> 24:18.174
Do I have to go?

24:18.468 --> 24:20.085
Well, what are you talking about?
Go where, babe?

24:20.136 --> 24:20.960
Church.

24:21.334 --> 24:22.119
Church?

24:22.293 --> 24:24.054
Church.
Mommy says we're going to church,

24:24.105 --> 24:25.296
and it's not even our church.

24:25.678 --> 24:27.769
All of us.
And I don't want to go.

24:27.820 --> 24:30.227
It's Wednesday. Can't I just go to Claire's?

24:31.263 --> 24:32.696
Church?

24:36.534 --> 24:37.529
Church?

24:37.755 --> 24:38.399
What?!

24:38.588 --> 24:39.433
Church!

24:40.973 --> 24:44.234
I just heard a  vicious rumor
that the Dubois family is going to church.

24:45.214 --> 24:46.342
I thought it'd be nice.

24:46.673 --> 24:49.519
They're having a prayer vigil for Isabel Navarro at 6:30.

24:49.570 --> 24:52.363
We'll be back before dark. What could be the harm?

24:52.527 --> 24:53.442
I see.

24:53.577 --> 24:56.954
And being good Catholics and close personal friends of Isabel's,

24:57.007 --> 24:59.152
you thought we'd all go and offer our prayers?

24:59.723 --> 25:01.257
Oh, that's right, we're not Catholic...

25:01.586 --> 25:03.247
and none of us have ever met the woman.

25:03.715 --> 25:05.924
Could there be some other purpose in all this?

25:06.461 --> 25:09.645
You're not hoping to coax something out of the good Father, are you?

25:09.696 --> 25:11.754
Well, I just thought if we met face to face...

25:12.082 --> 25:13.274
The man took a vow.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.651
And so did you.

25:16.613 --> 25:18.915
Wear the blue, please?

25:20.774 --> 25:23.038
I would like to thank everyone who spoke tonight,

25:24.253 --> 25:26.551
everyone who offered their prayers.

25:27.372 --> 25:31.029
This is an anxious moment for all of us who know Isabel.

25:31.829 --> 25:35.773
This is also an anxious time for anyone who believes in God,

25:35.824 --> 25:40.722
because we must somehow reconcile the fear that consumes us,

25:41.453 --> 25:43.520
the anger that grips us,

25:43.587 --> 25:45.524
and the sadness that fills us up

25:46.091 --> 25:48.884
with the faith we have all been taught will see us through.

25:50.676 --> 25:52.059
And I know what you're thinking,

25:52.688 --> 25:54.099
Mr. Navarro.
You're thinking,

25:54.166 --> 25:56.138
"It is easy for you to speak of faith.

25:57.266 --> 25:59.777
You do not have a daughter to lose, Father."

26:00.934 --> 26:02.203
And you would be right.

26:03.828 --> 26:07.299
I will never know the love that a parent has for a child.

26:08.507 --> 26:12.240
In fact, the only love I know that might come close...

26:13.402 --> 26:14.831
is my love for God.

26:17.096 --> 26:20.221
My love for God is all consuming...

26:21.135 --> 26:23.798
and yet, I pledge to you...

26:25.166 --> 26:29.048
and pledge to the man who took away our Isabel...

26:30.929 --> 26:36.699
if you do not come forward, if you do not return our Isabel...

26:38.483 --> 26:44.145
...if you do not put an end to this interminable suffering and sadness...

26:45.724 --> 26:49.423
I cannot promise you that I will not betray my vows...

26:50.223 --> 26:51.047
Oh, my God.

26:51.814 --> 26:52.414
What, babe?

26:52.476 --> 26:54.794
- ...give up the thing that I love most...
- He's talking to him.

26:55.037 --> 27:00.316
...betray my God and do all that I can to find you...

27:00.367 --> 27:01.034
Talking to who?

27:01.297 --> 27:02.849
to unmask you...

27:03.802 --> 27:05.255
to see that you suffer...

27:06.003 --> 27:07.782
as Isabel has suffered...

27:09.538 --> 27:11.699
as her father has suffered...

27:12.966 --> 27:16.152
- Al, sit down.
- ...as everyone who knows Isabel has suffered.

27:16.436 --> 27:17.947
He's talking to him. He's here.

27:18.711 --> 27:19.764
Who's here, Mommy?

27:20.381 --> 27:22.535
Mommy, sit down. Everybody's staring.

27:35.037 --> 27:36.503
And now, let us take a moment,

27:37.598 --> 27:41.930
rise... and offer each other the sign of peace.

27:45.492 --> 27:46.181
Gracias.

27:54.854 --> 27:55.848
Thank you for coming.

27:56.098 --> 27:57.284
May God be with you.

27:57.653 --> 27:58.943
He was here, wasn't he?

27:59.159 --> 28:00.817
He was right here, right in front of you,

28:00.868 --> 28:03.261
right in front of us, and you let him walk out the door.

28:04.494 --> 28:07.180
You're the woman in the confessional.

28:08.233 --> 28:09.701
You work for the District Attorney.

28:10.518 --> 28:11.746
But you leave me your phone number,

28:11.797 --> 28:14.241
you claim that you can read my thoughts if I let you?

28:14.653 --> 28:17.716
Is this a new form of forensics I haven't read about?

28:20.908 --> 28:23.324
As I said before, God be with you.

28:24.784 --> 28:26.536
Well... who will be with Isabel?

28:26.845 --> 28:29.661
Rest assured, God will protect Isabel.

28:29.843 --> 28:31.680
Well, maybe God wants us to protect Isabel.

28:31.971 --> 28:33.269
Maybe you and I are the way.

28:33.412 --> 28:34.576
No, not yet.

28:34.751 --> 28:35.965
Not today, we're not.

28:36.142 --> 28:37.076
I don't understand.

28:37.127 --> 28:37.971
You said you would do it.

28:38.022 --> 28:39.166
You said you would tell.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.215
I heard you.

28:40.266 --> 28:41.798
You were talking to him up there,

28:41.849 --> 28:43.172
threatening to break your vow.

28:43.917 --> 28:46.039
Please! Help me!

28:46.836 --> 28:48.205
Just tell me who he is.

28:48.565 --> 28:50.714
I can't. Not yet.

28:51.443 --> 28:55.564
First, we must let God do His work, to hear our prayers.

28:55.617 --> 28:56.699
That is faith.

28:56.750 --> 28:57.860
There's no time.

28:57.911 --> 28:59.011
There's always time.

28:59.597 --> 29:01.758
And then, if God lets us down, which he won't,

29:02.054 --> 29:03.527
then I suppose it's time for vengeance.

29:03.578 --> 29:05.046
I don't care about vengeance.

29:05.097 --> 29:06.672
I just want to find her.

29:07.739 --> 29:10.212
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

29:14.766 --> 29:16.331
Just let me into your head.

29:16.382 --> 29:18.275
Just let me see who he is.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.607
May God be with you.

29:20.685 --> 29:21.453
Father.

29:21.951 --> 29:25.321
Father, when you sleep, do you dream?

29:25.758 --> 29:27.768
Of course I do.
Everyone dreams.

29:28.145 --> 29:30.169
Good. So do I.

29:37.625 --> 29:38.779
So, what did he say?

29:40.959 --> 29:43.828
I got a lot of eye rolling and a lecture about faith.

29:45.154 --> 29:45.881
Sorry.

29:47.484 --> 29:49.506
Hey, you know what conversation we never finished?

29:50.919 --> 29:52.529
I want to drive to Salt Lake City.

29:54.399 --> 29:55.269
All right.

29:57.053 --> 29:59.087
Fine. It's just that, I mean,

29:59.138 --> 30:01.206
it's like we don't control our lives anymore.

30:02.312 --> 30:04.431
We plan a trip, you dream a dream, we can't go.

30:05.833 --> 30:08.527
What happens when you have a dream about Christmas, going to the circus?

30:08.578 --> 30:10.193
We'll be prisoners in the house.

30:10.244 --> 30:13.894
Maybe, or maybe we'll be happy at home, having survived some awful calamity.

30:14.998 --> 30:16.733
So I gather last night, you dreamt again?

30:22.240 --> 30:26.265
I found your wallet... in a debris field.

30:27.180 --> 30:29.306
The plane was still smoldering.

30:33.839 --> 30:35.199
Were you on the plane?

30:35.751 --> 30:36.903
It's hard to say.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.331
Why? I'd think it'd be fairly easy.

30:39.382 --> 30:42.942
Were you... burned, disoriented?

30:43.009 --> 30:45.826
Were your clothes or your skin singed?

30:48.340 --> 30:49.017
No.

30:49.443 --> 30:51.170
Then it sounds to me like you weren't on the plane.

30:51.221 --> 30:51.932
If you weren't on the plane,

30:51.983 --> 30:54.327
you can't have been dreaming about the trip we're making Friday.

30:54.378 --> 30:56.484
- Joe...
- Hey, Allison, no.

30:56.535 --> 30:58.093
I am allowed-- in fact, I'm obligated--

30:58.144 --> 31:00.829
to inject a little freaking logic into this conversation.

31:01.984 --> 31:03.109
For God's sake.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.856
Do you have any idea how far Salt Lake City is?

31:06.595 --> 31:08.464
I mean, shoot me, but I don't want to spend 11 freaking hours

31:08.515 --> 31:10.643
- Well, I don't want my family to die in a plane crash!
- with three kids in a car!

31:10.933 --> 31:15.171
Wait a second. Who's going to die in a plane crash?

31:16.747 --> 31:17.648
Nobody, honey.

31:17.699 --> 31:19.205
Nobody's going to die in a plane crash.

31:19.854 --> 31:22.356
I don't want to go on a plane that's going to crash.

31:22.757 --> 31:25.892
Trust me, Bridge, planes don't crash... really.

31:25.943 --> 31:28.007
Almost never. They're amazingly safe.

31:29.299 --> 31:32.437
Only people who are ignorant or superstitious stay off planes

31:32.488 --> 31:34.346
'cause they think they're going to crash.

31:53.506 --> 31:54.415
So...

31:55.062 --> 31:56.331
Don't worry. No dreams.

31:56.382 --> 31:59.046
Not a single ignorant, superstitious one.

32:01.394 --> 32:02.640
Oh.

32:06.277 --> 32:08.659
Hey, make sure you guys give these notes to your teachers

32:08.710 --> 32:10.178
so they know why you're not in school tomorrow.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.837
I don't get it-- are we driving or flying?
I can't keep it straight.

32:12.888 --> 32:15.406
We are flying.
Daddy and I talked about it, and we're flying.

32:15.457 --> 32:17.134
Al, Scanlon.

32:20.901 --> 32:22.778
- Good morning.|- John Hammond.

32:25.074 --> 32:26.473
Who? I'm sorry.

32:26.524 --> 32:28.789
You ought to be. What kind of psychic are you, anyway?

32:29.159 --> 32:31.619
John Hammond's the name of the man who snatched Isabel Navarro.

32:32.749 --> 32:33.804
Allison?

32:34.827 --> 32:36.524
Oh, my God. How?

32:37.097 --> 32:38.160
We caught a break.

32:38.737 --> 32:40.198
Got a missing person's report on him.

32:40.265 --> 32:43.000
Turns out the guy hadn't shown up for work
since the day Isabel disappeared,

32:43.977 --> 32:45.562
and he's a parishioner at St. Brendan's,

32:46.145 --> 32:47.498
so we sent a unit over to the house.

32:48.026 --> 32:50.086
Well, did you talk to him?
What did he say?

32:50.702 --> 32:52.618
Well, you might have better luck with that.

32:53.256 --> 32:54.163
What do you mean?

32:55.833 --> 32:57.911
He's dead, Allison.
Shot himself in the head.

32:59.012 --> 33:00.170
Last night, it looks like.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.119
Last night? After mass?

33:05.317 --> 33:06.525
What about Isabel?

33:06.659 --> 33:07.804
She wasn't there.

33:08.507 --> 33:10.629
We're guessing wherever she is, she's been for a while.

33:14.624 --> 33:16.737
It's not looking terribly promising, Allison.

33:17.781 --> 33:19.946
I mean, maybe if we got to him last night...

33:22.484 --> 33:23.584
You okay?

33:23.718 --> 33:24.958
Yeah, I'm okay.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.222
Just let me know what happens.

33:28.546 --> 33:30.064
I've got a trip to pack for.

33:41.766 --> 33:43.099
Just a second!

33:49.828 --> 33:51.033
Good morning, Mrs. Dubois.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.758
Really? I think that depends on who you ask, Father.

33:56.515 --> 33:58.576
He was right there, wasn't he?

34:00.424 --> 34:02.322
I debated with myself for a long time

34:02.373 --> 34:04.244
about whether I should come by or not.

34:04.816 --> 34:05.707
I thought to myself,

34:05.758 --> 34:08.458
if she can really do what she claims she can do,

34:08.953 --> 34:10.667
then she'll know how sad I am.

34:11.543 --> 34:14.924
Know how sorry I am. Know that...

34:15.359 --> 34:17.165
I had no other choice.

34:18.771 --> 34:20.293
Well, I do know all that.

34:20.683 --> 34:23.746
But I don't think it matters very much to Isabel Navarro.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.074
I don't understand.

34:27.125 --> 34:31.208
She is out there somewhere, and we will probably never find her.

34:31.522 --> 34:33.608
And yet, you seem so calm.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.513
I told you, I have faith.

34:36.780 --> 34:38.228
Faith in God's wisdom.

34:39.274 --> 34:42.188
Faith that you and the people you work with will find her

34:42.239 --> 34:43.460
if she's meant to be found.

34:43.511 --> 34:46.248
Faith that everything will happen the way it's supposed to.

34:47.739 --> 34:49.088
I almost envy you.

34:49.139 --> 34:52.222
I'm in here packing for my family to go to a wedding,

34:52.273 --> 34:54.732
and I keep thinking I should be out there searching for her.

34:55.853 --> 34:57.116
You want my advice?

34:58.199 --> 34:59.330
Go to the wedding.

34:59.410 --> 35:01.400
Thank you, Father, but it's not what you think.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.208
My husband's sister is getting married for the third time.

35:04.322 --> 35:05.926
I'm pretty sure the reception is B.Y.O...

35:05.977 --> 35:08.557
Doesn't matter. Go to the wedding.

35:10.177 --> 35:11.562
Whatever you say, Father.

35:11.613 --> 35:12.624
I'm serious.

35:13.152 --> 35:17.299
Weddings are beginnings. They're hopeful.

35:17.898 --> 35:21.758
Optimistic. You don't want to miss that.

35:24.373 --> 35:27.174
God is watching over Isabel.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.366
I hope so.

35:33.169 --> 35:35.775
Have a good trip, Mrs. Dubois.

35:36.592 --> 35:37.875
Thank you.

35:39.343 --> 35:40.820
I'll try.

35:45.255 --> 35:46.705
Al, you get the bedroom windows?

35:46.756 --> 35:48.568
Yes, for the third time.

35:49.107 --> 35:50.659
Okay, we got to go!

35:50.931 --> 35:52.670
Takes at least 45 minutes to get to the airport

35:52.721 --> 35:54.097
and a half hour to get through security.

35:54.148 --> 35:55.580
I'm with you.

35:56.508 --> 35:57.339
Where are you going?

35:57.390 --> 35:59.042
Check the bedroom windows.

35:59.702 --> 36:01.249
- I'm ready.
- Great.

36:01.373 --> 36:02.997
Ariel, do me a favor. Go get Bridgette.

36:03.048 --> 36:04.714
Bridgette, come on!

36:04.913 --> 36:07.047
I could've done that myself, sweetie.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.479
Okay, I'll pack the car.

36:10.473 --> 36:12.630
Where's Bridgette?
Is she in the bathroom or something?

36:12.681 --> 36:14.850
Bridge, come on! We've got to go!

36:17.040 --> 36:18.100
Bridge?!

36:20.127 --> 36:21.344
I'll get her.

36:27.572 --> 36:29.632
Bridge? Come on, sweetie.

36:29.925 --> 36:32.252
We can play hide and seek at Aunt Tracy's, okay?

36:32.605 --> 36:33.934
Honey, come on.

36:33.985 --> 36:34.882
Bridge?

36:41.739 --> 36:42.600
Bridge?

36:49.637 --> 36:50.911
Hey, sweetie.

36:51.418 --> 36:53.475
I don't want to crash.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.645
Honey, we're not gonna crash. I explained that to you.

36:56.958 --> 36:58.559
But I keep dreaming it.

36:58.611 --> 37:00.881
The plane crashes into the dirt,

37:01.599 --> 37:05.015
and then you end up hanging from a tree, all burned up.

37:05.587 --> 37:07.325
I keep dreaming it.

37:13.566 --> 37:14.405
What?

37:15.515 --> 37:17.477
You never mentioned anything about a tree.

37:21.993 --> 37:24.346
Okay, that's it.

37:24.714 --> 37:27.535
Everyone go to the bathroom. We're driving.

37:27.638 --> 37:29.106
What did you just say?!

37:29.349 --> 37:30.391
We're driving.

37:31.059 --> 37:32.592
Come on, it'll be fun.

37:32.649 --> 37:34.683
I'm getting giddy just thinking about it.

37:34.758 --> 37:36.696
Come on, let's go get some CDs.

37:39.078 --> 37:39.678
Joe.

37:39.638 --> 37:43.093
I can count. Two psychics against one engineer.

37:43.144 --> 37:44.849
It's no contest-- we're driving.

37:48.645 --> 37:51.070
We got all the kids' allergy stuff.

37:52.822 --> 37:55.173
Something to remove toenail fungus,

37:55.261 --> 37:57.557
but no Tylenol.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.221
Shh, oh, baby girl.

38:01.227 --> 38:02.837
Shh. Shh. Shh.

38:03.436 --> 38:04.874
She definitely has a fever.

38:05.076 --> 38:06.373
Of course, she does.

38:06.426 --> 38:08.667
We're in the middle of nowhere, five hours from home.

38:09.517 --> 38:10.791
Of course, she has a fever.

38:19.642 --> 38:20.953
What did you do?

38:22.360 --> 38:23.764
It's the power of prayer.

38:29.357 --> 38:31.388
You know, I couldn't help it, I called.

38:31.613 --> 38:32.881
I checked on our flight.

38:33.534 --> 38:35.811
It landed in Salt Lake safe and sound--

38:36.218 --> 38:38.113
five minutes early, in fact.

38:39.851 --> 38:40.725
Okay.

38:42.564 --> 38:44.735
It's always going to be like this, isn't it?

38:46.393 --> 38:48.161
Worrying about what's gonna happen.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.160
We have three kids.

38:52.682 --> 38:54.336
We have a pretty great life.

38:55.019 --> 38:57.338
I think worrying just comes with the territory.

38:58.600 --> 38:59.982
Dreams or no dreams.

39:01.726 --> 39:02.997
Okay, enough is enough.

39:03.048 --> 39:03.967
Sweetheart.

39:04.018 --> 39:05.393
All right, this girl has a fever.

39:05.444 --> 39:06.910
I'm gonna go find a drug store.

39:51.635 --> 39:53.152
Can you hear me now?

39:54.463 --> 39:55.410
No.

40:06.882 --> 40:07.982
Hello?!

40:09.290 --> 40:10.272
Hello!

40:20.341 --> 40:21.288
Hello!

40:24.484 --> 40:25.858
Anybody home?!

40:27.625 --> 40:29.169
Oh, great.

41:09.739 --> 41:10.764
Hello? Joe?

41:11.458 --> 41:14.528
No, I'm just happy to hear your voice that's all.

41:20.743 --> 41:22.175
Honey, the Jeep broke down.

41:22.982 --> 41:25.341
I'm in a big white barn right off Route 59.

41:40.208 --> 41:41.056
Hold on a second.

41:44.902 --> 41:46.957
Joe, I need you to call the police.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.647
No, I'm fine!

41:48.983 --> 41:50.245
I think I found her.

41:50.544 --> 41:51.393
Yeah.

41:51.863 --> 41:53.030
The Jeep's out on the road.

41:53.101 --> 41:55.035
And then I need you to call an ambulance.

41:55.360 --> 41:58.213
Then I need you to call me back and let me know that you got through.

41:58.548 --> 42:00.055
Help! Somebody, help!

42:01.081 --> 42:02.670
I'm coming to get you!

42:32.578 --> 42:34.740
It's okay, it's okay.
