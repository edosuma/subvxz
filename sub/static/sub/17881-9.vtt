WEBVTT

00:05.249 --> 00:07.085
I always present choices.

00:07.086 --> 00:08.779
Where you can take the high-road

00:08.780 --> 00:10.204
or the low-road.

00:10.602 --> 00:12.099
This is Pete Gilroy.

00:12.100 --> 00:15.080
He runs others researches
in develpment department.

00:15.118 --> 00:16.852
Petes a low-road guy.

00:16.853 --> 00:20.622
Is this anyone's hoagie? Anyone? No.

00:20.623 --> 00:22.124
I asked.

00:24.753 --> 00:27.111
I, on the other hand, try
to stay on the high road.

00:29.763 --> 00:33.015
Two? But only paid for one.

00:33.016 --> 00:35.948
that's it.

00:35.949 --> 00:37.483
Oh, almost...

00:37.484 --> 00:39.148
There.

00:39.149 --> 00:41.450
Ted on his back, straining with effort?

00:42.818 --> 00:44.794
there's a mental picture
I can call back later.

00:45.721 --> 00:47.604
That's gonna hurt for a while.

00:47.639 --> 00:48.780
Hey, Ted.

00:48.815 --> 00:51.148
Strengthening your hand for
that big date with yourself?

00:51.183 --> 00:54.936
Nope, just practicing for later
when I squeeze your mom's boobs.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.665
I'm not proud of that.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.579
I actually had a lovely
conversation with Pete's mom

00:59.614 --> 01:02.044
at the Christmas party.

01:02.045 --> 01:04.815
The mat and the vest
are both magnetized.

01:04.816 --> 01:07.284
When a child puts on the
vest and steps on the mat,

01:07.285 --> 01:08.754
the magnets repel each other,

01:08.789 --> 01:10.769
mang the child almost weightless,

01:10.804 --> 01:12.737
like an astronaut bouncing on the moon.

01:12.738 --> 01:15.953
Now every child can have
hours of repulsive fun.

01:15.988 --> 01:18.496
Pete gilroy's team is
working on a similar system,

01:18.497 --> 01:21.064
and the company's only
gonna go forward with one.

01:21.065 --> 01:25.971
So we need to make damn sure
that it is "the floater."

01:28.073 --> 01:29.855
Yeah, that's not such a good name.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.647
What about "the astro-nut"?

01:31.682 --> 01:34.253
You know, because it's crazy.

01:34.288 --> 01:37.384
Has waving your hands
ever sold me on anything?

01:37.385 --> 01:42.189
Remember "corpse-eating
battlefield robot"?

01:42.190 --> 01:43.890
No.

01:43.891 --> 01:46.326
What we have here is...

01:46.327 --> 01:49.362
"The dream glider."

01:51.466 --> 01:54.229
- That's fantastic.
- That's fantastic.

01:54.230 --> 01:56.837
This technology also has a
exciting military potencial.

01:56.872 --> 02:00.439
Imagine soldiers hovering
above a magnetized battlefield.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.843
The Chinese won't know what hit 'em.

02:03.844 --> 02:06.179
Oh, come on. We all
know that war is coming.

02:06.180 --> 02:07.341
Can't we develop one product

02:07.376 --> 02:09.845
that doesn't end up
being used to kill people?

02:09.880 --> 02:13.029
Even our fat-free cinnamon roll
led to that new sticky bomb.

02:13.064 --> 02:15.500
You're so moral and
perfect all the time.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.494
Do singing birds and mice dress you

02:17.529 --> 02:20.163
and brush your hair in the morning?

02:20.164 --> 02:22.569
no.

02:22.604 --> 02:24.415
Although my dad does call me "princess,"

02:24.450 --> 02:27.773
and there is a grumpy
dwarf in my building.

02:32.346 --> 02:33.821
Ted, we need your help.

02:33.822 --> 02:35.877
We were working really
hard in the lab...

02:35.912 --> 02:37.757
- And we had this pinata.
- Pinata?

02:37.758 --> 02:39.523
That doesn't sound
like really hard work.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.888
It was stuffed with science.

02:43.024 --> 02:45.525
And...

02:45.526 --> 02:47.827
Pinata!

02:53.233 --> 02:54.924
And now the thermostat's broken,

02:54.959 --> 02:56.973
and we were wondering if
you would tell the company

02:57.008 --> 02:58.251
so they'll fix it.

02:58.252 --> 02:59.375
We're worried if we report it,

02:59.410 --> 03:02.059
the coany will retaliate,
like when I broke the flywheel

03:02.094 --> 03:03.862
and they canceled my gym membership.

03:03.897 --> 03:07.014
I mean, you remember
how ripped I was gettin'.

03:07.015 --> 03:08.473
Guys, you broke the thermostat.

03:08.508 --> 03:10.253
Just take the high road and report it.

03:10.288 --> 03:12.112
And, Phil, they canceled
your gym membership

03:12.147 --> 03:17.026
because no matter what class
you were in, you did jazzercise.

03:17.027 --> 03:19.529
But I don't want to take the high road.

03:19.530 --> 03:20.863
It's high.

03:20.864 --> 03:24.700
I agree. We could fall off.

03:28.004 --> 03:31.473
I can't stand that Veronica
makes fun of me in meetings.

03:31.474 --> 03:34.075
If the boss doesn't respect
me, other people won't,

03:34.110 --> 03:36.278
including the little Linda in my head.

03:36.279 --> 03:39.080
And even on a good day,
that bitch never shuts up.

03:39.081 --> 03:41.116
Veronica just has
trouble relating to you.

03:41.117 --> 03:43.819
She thinks you always
want to do the right thing.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.822
I don't alway do the right thing.

03:45.823 --> 03:48.524
- Hey.
- Hey, daddy. Hi, Linda.

03:48.525 --> 03:51.094
Hey, sweetie. Want to go smoke
a cigarette in the bathroom?

03:51.095 --> 03:53.163
See? I can be bad.

03:53.164 --> 03:54.631
Don't ever smoke, Rose.

03:54.632 --> 03:55.956
Every time you smoke a cigarette,

03:55.991 --> 03:59.173
Santa claus kills an elf.
What, helping or hurting?

03:59.208 --> 04:00.698
Because I can throw jesus into the mix.

04:00.733 --> 04:03.964
I think we're good. Honey, you
ready to go down to the hive?

04:03.965 --> 04:05.215
The hive?

04:05.250 --> 04:07.171
I thought you didn't like
veridian's after-school care

04:07.206 --> 04:09.327
because they use the kids
for free janitorial work

04:09.362 --> 04:11.611
- around the building.
- Yeah. Well, the hive has changed.

04:11.646 --> 04:13.553
A lot of the executives'
kids go there now.

04:13.588 --> 04:17.057
So they teach music and Chinese,
the weaknesses of the Chinese...

04:17.058 --> 04:18.550
Chet just call.

04:18.584 --> 04:22.692
Oh, hi, Rose. You look
fabulous. Have you lost weight?

04:22.693 --> 04:25.295
I have been playing a lot of dodgeball.

04:25.296 --> 04:27.086
Well, it's working for you.

04:27.121 --> 04:30.042
I'm trying to teach Rose
that it's not all about looks.

04:30.077 --> 04:33.243
- She's also very smart.
- Smart enough to stay skinny.

04:33.278 --> 04:36.727
Anyway, Chet wants us to come up
and pitch him the dream glider.

04:36.728 --> 04:38.515
Dream glider?

04:38.644 --> 04:40.912
I know. It's fantastic.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.482
Of course, lady pope over
here thinks it's immoral.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.986
I'm no lady pope. I once
slept with my cousin's husband.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.957
They were breaking up,
and I was really drunk.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.754
Oh, and don't ever do that
either, or the tooth fairy

04:54.789 --> 04:58.263
will put other people's
teeth in your mouth.

04:58.264 --> 05:01.567
I'll meet you in Chet's
office after I drop off Rose.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.101
Come on, sweetie.

05:03.102 --> 05:06.906
Let's go try to forget all
the stuff that Linda said.

05:06.907 --> 05:10.710
Allowing a child of 80
pounds or less to hover, roll,

05:10.711 --> 05:15.148
spin or flip without ever
leaving their home planet.

05:15.149 --> 05:19.219
We'll see what testing says,
but I'm flipping for this.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.469
that's funny, because you just used

05:22.504 --> 05:26.126
one of the words Ted just said.

05:26.127 --> 05:27.793
No, that's great, guys.
It's a really good job.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.762
I do have one question. Um,
are little boys gonna want

05:30.797 --> 05:35.203
to look like they have a set of boobies?

05:35.204 --> 05:38.774
hey, Chet, my eyes are up here.

05:38.775 --> 05:41.443
wait, let's see if I can get
the... the tassels going in...

05:41.444 --> 05:43.412
in difrent directions. There we go.

05:43.413 --> 05:45.948
no, anyway, I think it's a home run.

05:45.949 --> 05:48.919
Pete, why don't you show Chet
what our team has come up with?

05:48.920 --> 05:50.261
It may not sexualize children,

05:50.296 --> 05:53.924
but we think that every kid's
gonna want to wear one of these.

05:53.925 --> 05:57.495
Lower center of gravity.
Allows the kid to be even safer

05:57.496 --> 05:58.651
and jump even higher.

05:58.652 --> 05:59.845
Sure, they're doing whatever they can

05:59.880 --> 06:00.931
to get out of that diaper.

06:00.932 --> 06:02.338
Zing! Bang.

06:03.369 --> 06:05.270
Pete and i have a long history

06:05.271 --> 06:06.787
of trying to undermine each other.

06:06.788 --> 06:08.585
Solar paint.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.384
It absorbs the sun's energy,
cutting heating costs...

06:11.419 --> 06:13.011
fantastic. I just...
I have one question.

06:13.046 --> 06:15.369
Uh, can you make the color
look even more like barf?

06:15.404 --> 06:19.516
maybe add some bits of chewed-up
hot dog to complete the effect.

06:19.517 --> 06:21.217
zing, bang!

06:21.218 --> 06:23.619
it's a purification straw.

06:23.620 --> 06:26.021
Any water you drink through
it, no matter how polluted,

06:26.022 --> 06:29.057
- becomes safe for consumption.
- That's a great idea.

06:29.058 --> 06:31.961
"No dessert, kids, until you
finish drinking your sewage."

06:31.962 --> 06:34.230
Bang, bang!

06:35.799 --> 06:38.769
Occasionally, Veronica tried
to get her licks in, too.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.804
Unfortunately, she took big swings

06:40.805 --> 06:42.729
but rarely connected.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.105
Hey, Pete, with your diaper,

06:44.140 --> 06:48.280
kids won't have to stop
playing to go to the bathroom.

06:48.281 --> 06:51.116
Hey, Pete, do those come in disposable,

06:51.117 --> 06:54.387
or do you have to
wash 'em out each time?

06:56.690 --> 06:59.226
- Veronica...
- Wait. I can do this.

06:59.227 --> 07:02.295
Hey, Pete, is it true that in space,

07:02.296 --> 07:04.764
no one can hear you poop?

07:07.268 --> 07:09.836
Oh, come on. That was hilarious.

07:09.837 --> 07:12.071
I hate Pete. We need
to crush that wanker,

07:12.072 --> 07:14.173
teach him not to mess with us anymore.

07:14.174 --> 07:16.175
I'm sick of this war. It
just hurts both our teams.

07:16.210 --> 07:17.631
We need to change tactics,

07:17.666 --> 07:19.125
figure out a way to
get along with Pete...

07:19.160 --> 07:20.436
you know, take the high road.

07:20.437 --> 07:22.751
I don't take the high road, Ted.

07:22.786 --> 07:24.764
The high road leads to pansy town.

07:24.799 --> 07:27.321
Or maybe it ads to a more effective way

07:27.356 --> 07:29.589
of handling an adversary... ville.

07:29.590 --> 07:32.158
You take your road. I'll take mine.

07:32.159 --> 07:34.361
look at that thing.

07:34.362 --> 07:38.365
Somewhere, a naked sumo wrestler
is looking for his pants.

07:38.366 --> 07:40.534
Damn it! That's fantastic.

07:40.535 --> 07:42.469
Hey, Pete!

07:45.770 --> 07:47.508
Veridian Dynamics

07:47.509 --> 07:50.510
doing the right thing... it's important.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.746
What does it mean in business?

07:52.747 --> 07:55.049
We have no idea.

07:55.050 --> 07:57.318
We know what wrong is.

07:57.319 --> 07:59.520
Actually, no, we don't,

07:59.521 --> 08:01.689
because we're a successful company,

08:01.690 --> 08:04.826
not some boring ethics professor...

08:05.185 --> 08:06.771
Veridian Dynamics

08:06.772 --> 08:09.729
Right and Wrong. It means something.

08:09.730 --> 08:11.971
We just don't know what.

08:16.543 --> 08:19.678
For guys who spend as much time
thinking about boobs as we do,

08:19.679 --> 08:21.846
you'd think we would
have caught this one.

08:21.847 --> 08:24.218
hey, fellas. Man, it is hot in here.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.354
Yes, it's very unpleasant.

08:26.389 --> 08:29.842
So you've decided not to
report the thermostat, huh?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.868
You guys have more brains
than a zombie Thanksgiving,

08:31.903 --> 08:34.744
and your genius plan is to do nothing?

08:34.779 --> 08:37.298
We're not doing nothing.
Doing nothing is passive.

08:37.332 --> 08:40.235
We're waiting, from the
action verb "to wait..."

08:40.270 --> 08:42.798
For someone who finds
this heat so intolerable,

08:42.832 --> 08:44.145
they have to report it.

08:44.181 --> 08:47.260
Can I get you some hot
tea or Mexican chiles?

08:47.295 --> 08:48.904
For God sake, Ted, help us!

08:48.939 --> 08:50.838
Hey, I'm sorry, fell,
but you made this bed.

08:50.873 --> 08:52.479
Now you gotta sweat in it.

08:52.514 --> 08:57.318
So I need you to look at Pete's
version of the dream glider.

08:57.353 --> 08:58.988
See if you can redesign
it so it doesn't look like

08:59.023 --> 09:00.252
a bathroom strapped to your ass.

09:00.253 --> 09:02.160
Why would we want to help Pete?

09:02.195 --> 09:04.502
Or you? Making us suffer like this.

09:04.537 --> 09:06.158
It's a goodwill gesture.

09:06.193 --> 09:07.772
I'm, uh, trying to make peace with Pete,

09:07.807 --> 09:10.420
you know, warm things up between us,

09:10.455 --> 09:12.894
get things cooking.

09:12.895 --> 09:14.198
Light a fire under our friendship.

09:14.233 --> 09:17.065
Sweaty, sweaty, sweaty, sweaty.

09:17.066 --> 09:18.148
Oh, I get it.

09:18.183 --> 09:21.216
Because zombies would eat
brains for Thanksgiving.

09:21.251 --> 09:23.706
Oh! That's outrageous.

09:30.532 --> 09:32.798
you make no sound when you walk.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.683
Then I am ready to leave the monastery

09:34.718 --> 09:37.421
and avenge my parents.

09:37.456 --> 09:38.563
I'm kidding.

09:38.598 --> 09:41.712
I just buy expensive shoes
made from very soft animals.

09:41.747 --> 09:45.167
So I know you're too
much of a she-Gandhi

09:45.202 --> 09:47.044
to ever do anything wrong,

09:47.079 --> 09:48.428
but I need a person who will

09:48.463 --> 09:50.851
and thought maybe you
could suggest someone

09:50.886 --> 09:52.428
- who's not as...
- Me!

09:52.463 --> 09:54.610
Yes, exactly. Not as you.

09:54.645 --> 09:56.942
No, I mean, I suggest me.

09:56.977 --> 09:58.908
I'm not some scout girl.

09:58.943 --> 10:02.169
Well, you are eager and
desperate for my approval.

10:02.204 --> 10:03.626
And that's two of the three qualities

10:03.661 --> 10:05.148
I look for in a partner.

10:05.183 --> 10:08.550
I need someone who knows about
testing and is willing to cheat

10:08.585 --> 10:11.656
to make sure Pete's
magnet pants test badly.

10:11.691 --> 10:14.118
Then you need me.

10:14.153 --> 10:15.802
As testing coordinator
for our department,

10:15.837 --> 10:18.296
I totally know how to manipulate it.

10:18.331 --> 10:20.651
I mean, the testing
process is so flawed anyway.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.935
Really, the whole thing
is a bunch of garbage.

10:27.437 --> 10:28.544
I gotta go.

10:28.579 --> 10:29.589
Okay, bye, daddy.

10:29.624 --> 10:31.277
Bye, honey. I'll be
upstairs if you need me.

10:31.312 --> 10:33.093
Okay.

10:33.128 --> 10:35.078
Hey, Pete. What are you doing here?

10:35.113 --> 10:38.086
Well, I come every afternoon for
the juice boxes and story time.

10:38.121 --> 10:40.902
I have a daughter. What do
you think I'm doing here?

10:40.937 --> 10:44.887
oh, so I see your daughter's
into those pioneer girl dolls

10:44.922 --> 10:46.435
that come with the books.

10:46.436 --> 10:47.989
Yeah. Your daughter collect those?

10:48.024 --> 10:52.561
Only, like, all of 'em.
We just got Ida mae.

10:52.562 --> 10:54.034
Oh! Ida mae kills me.

10:54.069 --> 10:56.436
I know. The girl has rickets,
and she still wants to teach

10:56.471 --> 10:58.010
her blind brother to square-dance?

10:58.011 --> 11:00.206
I'm gonna die if she doesn't
survive the typhus epidemic.

11:00.241 --> 11:01.763
Well, she's a fighter.

11:01.798 --> 11:03.747
So, Pete, actually, I
was on my way to see you.

11:03.782 --> 11:07.331
I had my guys make some
adjustments on your magnet pants

11:07.366 --> 11:10.001
so they look less like
something you'd drop a deuce in.

11:10.036 --> 11:13.612
Yes, I get it. They're diapery.

11:13.613 --> 11:14.752
Wait, what's your game, crisp?

11:14.787 --> 11:17.207
It's just, we've been attacking
each other's projects for years.

11:17.242 --> 11:18.719
I think it's time we stop, you know?

11:18.731 --> 11:20.734
Let our ideas live or
die on their own merits.

11:20.766 --> 11:23.005
Yeah, right. You're trying
to glom on to my project

11:23.040 --> 11:24.393
because you heard it's testing first.

11:24.394 --> 11:25.799
Wait. You're testing first?

11:25.834 --> 11:28.667
Oh, ho, ho, ho! Ok at
the big, saucer eyes.

11:28.702 --> 11:31.749
Like you didn't know. You're
not testing for another week.

11:31.784 --> 11:32.857
That gives me huge momentum.

11:32.892 --> 11:34.599
By the time they test your
boob vest, it'll be dead.

11:34.634 --> 11:38.271
It's not a boob vest.
You're a boob vest.

11:38.372 --> 11:39.708
look, that's not what I'm doing, anyway.

11:39.743 --> 11:42.101
- I'm reaching out to you, dipwad.
- Screw you, Ted.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.691
okay, fine. I was
trying to be a grown-up,

11:44.726 --> 11:46.578
except for the dipwad thing.

11:46.613 --> 11:48.739
But I can see you're not interested.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.105
So the gloves are off.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.690
Oh, by the way,

11:53.725 --> 11:56.674
Ida mae survives the typhus epidemic...

11:56.709 --> 11:59.733
But then gets trampled
to death by a Buffalo.

11:59.768 --> 12:04.029
You are a special kind of monster.

12:06.105 --> 12:08.507
So Pete's project is testing today.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.503
I want to burn his diaper
and salt the earth beneath it

12:11.538 --> 12:13.581
so no new product will ever grow there.

12:13.616 --> 12:15.706
Test groups are easy to manipulate.

12:15.741 --> 12:18.274
People always agree with the
strongest voice in the room.

12:18.309 --> 12:20.737
All we have to do is
get one charismac person

12:20.772 --> 12:23.265
and make sure that person
is relentlessly negative,

12:23.300 --> 12:27.454
and then we'll be puttin' on
a pair of brand-new happy hats.

12:31.434 --> 12:33.151
what is it like in there?

12:33.186 --> 12:37.064
Actually, today is a pretty good day.

12:37.065 --> 12:40.164
So Pete's product is gonna
be tested by children.

12:40.199 --> 12:42.593
Then we have to find
a charismatic child.

12:50.229 --> 12:53.514
We'd like to check out Rose, please.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:03.119 --> 13:04.519
Okay.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.020
It's ready to go.

13:06.055 --> 13:07.883
Now all we have to do is
get Patricia to touch it,

13:07.918 --> 13:09.033
and it becomes her problem.

13:09.034 --> 13:10.790
I called her. She's on her way.

13:10.825 --> 13:13.777
Have you ever noticed
how much of men's lives

13:13.812 --> 13:16.316
are spent trying to trick
women into touching something?

13:16.351 --> 13:18.988
Ooh. Hey, guys. Uh,
you wanted to see me?

13:19.023 --> 13:20.305
Well, if you think it's
so damn hot in here,

13:20.340 --> 13:22.353
why don't you turn down the thermostat?

13:24.424 --> 13:26.336
I mean, hi, Patricia.

13:26.371 --> 13:28.617
You know, it is awfully hot in here.

13:28.652 --> 13:31.162
We like it hot. Keeps
out the... penguins.

13:31.197 --> 13:33.513
Yes. There's a bunch of 'em back there

13:33.548 --> 13:36.163
that have been trying to get in.

13:36.198 --> 13:38.949
There's no air in this room.
It's making you guys weird.

13:48.632 --> 13:50.709
What did you do, break
the thermostat? Yes.

13:50.744 --> 13:52.131
I barely touched it.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.758
Really, Patricia? Is that
how you're gonna play it?

13:53.793 --> 13:55.254
But I didn't even...

13:55.255 --> 13:56.285
we're past that now.

13:56.286 --> 13:58.142
Now we're on to how you're gonna fix it.

13:58.424 --> 13:59.547
I can't tell the company.

13:59.582 --> 14:01.326
They'll put something in my
food to make me infertile.

14:01.361 --> 14:04.292
They don't do things like
that or cancel gym memberships.

14:04.327 --> 14:07.555
Ooh. I guess I'll just have
to pay to get it fixed myself.

14:07.590 --> 14:12.111
Really? You're going to
fix it with your own money?

14:14.271 --> 14:16.058
Well, maybe you'll
learn a valuable lesson

14:16.093 --> 14:17.560
and be more careful next time.

14:17.561 --> 14:19.192
Yeah.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.418
And so I joined Lem and
Phil on the low road.

14:26.453 --> 14:28.709
And since testing first
is a huge advantage,

14:29.417 --> 14:34.059
I need to make sure that my
project goes before Pete's.

14:34.169 --> 14:35.348
William.

14:35.383 --> 14:39.238
Look what I found. It is
a signed first edition.

14:39.273 --> 14:41.974
Harry e. Wilson's "ethics in testing"?

14:42.009 --> 14:45.052
And it's yours if you do me one favor.

14:45.087 --> 14:50.364
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to get my hands on that book.

14:50.656 --> 14:53.037
So you're going to be in
a room filled with weak,

14:53.072 --> 14:55.614
malleable children, and a man
is going to bring in a toy.

14:55.649 --> 14:59.218
When he does, you're gonna
say very bad things about it.

14:59.253 --> 15:00.718
- Why?
- Because we're telling you to,

15:00.753 --> 15:03.264
and you should always do
what adults tell you to do,

15:03.299 --> 15:06.035
especially when they give you candy.

15:06.036 --> 15:08.227
It's just a fun game we're playing...

15:08.262 --> 15:10.993
like dress-up, only instead
of clothes, we're dressing up

15:11.028 --> 15:12.910
the things that are
coming out of your mouth.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.803
I want you to start by calling
the toy a creative misfire,

15:15.838 --> 15:17.772
an ill-conceived design paradigm

15:17.807 --> 15:19.770
that's irrelevant to your demographic.

15:20.593 --> 15:23.151
- Is she talking to me?
- she's trying to, sweetie.

15:23.186 --> 15:25.003
Come on. She's a kid.

15:25.038 --> 15:26.955
She has to say things
that a kid would say,

15:26.990 --> 15:29.071
like, "that's not phat. It's whack."

15:29.106 --> 15:31.322
Do the kids still talk like that?

15:31.357 --> 15:33.272
It was very hip when I was 8.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.548
Yeah, let's put a pin in
the lingo, flavor flav.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.872
So if anyone says something positive,

15:38.907 --> 15:41.379
you dismiss it with a derisive laugh.

15:41.414 --> 15:43.382
A what?

15:44.875 --> 15:46.850
No, no. It's more like...

15:47.739 --> 15:49.177
- like that.
- No, it's not.

15:49.212 --> 15:50.431
It's more like a...

15:51.413 --> 15:53.763
no, it's a... it's
an actual laugh. It...

15:54.893 --> 15:57.032
it's more of a gesture.

15:57.067 --> 16:01.386
What? No. it's a scoff. It's a, "huh."

16:03.767 --> 16:05.172
she's so sweet.

16:05.207 --> 16:06.540
Our little killing machine.

16:06.575 --> 16:09.048
She's gonna destroy Pete's moon diaper.

16:11.446 --> 16:13.264
You're phat, Linda.

16:13.299 --> 16:15.580
Why would you say that to me?

16:15.615 --> 16:17.733
I mean "phat" with a p-h.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.612
I'm reaching out to
you with your own lingo.

16:22.168 --> 16:25.221
I couldn't have done this without you.

16:25.222 --> 16:28.457
Well, ain't no thang.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.547
Hi, kids. My name's William,

16:30.582 --> 16:32.574
and I'm here to show you

16:32.609 --> 16:35.532
an exciting new veridian product.

16:36.170 --> 16:38.300
she nailed the laugh.

16:38.335 --> 16:41.037
She's very useful.

16:42.188 --> 16:45.277
Oh, God. That's our dream glider!

16:45.312 --> 16:46.876
Mother... holy...

16:46.877 --> 16:49.424
good news. I switched the testing.

16:49.459 --> 16:50.753
Hey, what's Rose doing in there?

16:50.788 --> 16:54.316
So any first impressions? Yes.

16:54.351 --> 16:56.809
I'd never play with that.

16:56.844 --> 16:59.920
I think it's stupid. It looks dangerous,

16:59.955 --> 17:02.020
like it could kill a Jonas Brother.

17:03.113 --> 17:05.252
No, no! Honey! Rose, honey, no, no!

17:05.287 --> 17:07.387
So any other thoughts?

17:11.702 --> 17:14.002
oh! I got an estimate.

17:14.038 --> 17:16.497
Fixing the particle-based
environmental control thermostat

17:16.531 --> 17:19.823
- costs $2,000.
- Wow. That sounds like a lot.

17:20.876 --> 17:22.380
But you did really break it.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.579
I can't afford that, so I
called my ex-boyfriend Rolf.

17:25.614 --> 17:26.938
He works in air conditioning.

17:26.973 --> 17:30.118
He'll fix it for free
if I have sex with him.

17:32.353 --> 17:35.162
Well... sex is good, right?

17:35.197 --> 17:38.053
not the way Rolf does it.

17:41.230 --> 17:43.884
All right, Patricia, we're sorry.

17:43.919 --> 17:46.356
Why? You guys didn't do anything.

17:46.391 --> 17:47.667
We broke the thermostat

17:47.702 --> 17:49.177
and made you think it was you.

17:49.212 --> 17:51.726
So in that sense, we did.

17:52.915 --> 17:54.840
Well, why would you do that?
I thought we were friends.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.512
We are. Maybe not good friends.

17:57.547 --> 17:59.442
No. Good friends would never do this.

17:59.477 --> 18:02.886
- We're not even good people.
- We're really not.

18:02.921 --> 18:05.320
You jerks get your own thermostat fixed.

18:05.355 --> 18:08.031
Plus, each of you give me $500

18:08.066 --> 18:09.835
or I'll tell the company you broke it.

18:09.870 --> 18:11.008
We're not giving you any money.

18:11.009 --> 18:12.300
No way.

18:12.335 --> 18:16.061
Okay, then... fight each other.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.025
- What?
- That's crazy.

18:18.060 --> 18:20.168
That's the deal. Either
you pay me the money,

18:20.203 --> 18:21.998
or I want to watch you fight.

18:22.033 --> 18:23.898
And now it's $700 from each of you.

18:23.933 --> 18:26.364
That's insane, okay? We're friends.

18:26.399 --> 18:28.508
There's no way Phil and I..

18:32.840 --> 18:35.176
I can't believe that you
involved my daughter in this,

18:35.211 --> 18:36.366
and you got her to lie.

18:36.401 --> 18:39.565
She was a star, Ted.
And you're not so pure.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.155
You're the one who switched the testing.

18:41.190 --> 18:44.558
Yeah, what were you thinking?
And pulling little Rose into it?

18:44.593 --> 18:47.060
Oh, wait. That was us.

18:47.095 --> 18:49.691
Switching the testing... how dare you?

18:49.726 --> 18:52.322
Testing is a sacred
covenant between our company

18:52.357 --> 18:54.219
and the American consumer.

18:54.254 --> 18:57.101
- You defiled that trust.
- Zing, bang.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.632
Stop, both of you.
You must stop talking.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.398
I think we're winning.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.470
Look, the project is now dead

19:03.505 --> 19:05.276
because we all took the low road.

19:05.311 --> 19:09.725
So I was right should
always stay on the high road.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.069
Lesson learned. The end.

19:12.104 --> 19:13.981
And you two are worse than me.

19:14.016 --> 19:16.054
Actually, I think the lesson here is,

19:16.089 --> 19:17.641
when we're on the low road,

19:17.676 --> 19:19.369
we really have to coordinate better.

19:19.404 --> 19:20.463
Now hear me out.

19:20.498 --> 19:22.201
Ted, I need you to set up
another round of testing.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.825
Linda, you mentioned you
have access to a dwarf.

19:24.860 --> 19:28.557
We dress him as a kid... first
of all, he's 74 years old.

19:28.592 --> 19:31.063
And at the risk of
you not respecting me,

19:31.098 --> 19:33.192
I'm gonna have to say, I'm done.

19:33.227 --> 19:35.294
I mean, I'm starting to
feel like a bond villain.

19:35.329 --> 19:37.411
Okay. Here's what's gonna happen.

19:37.446 --> 19:39.327
First of all, you two
are gonna go tell Rose

19:39.362 --> 19:41.425
and those other children
that what you did was wrong.

19:41.460 --> 19:44.791
Most importantly, I need your
word that the dwarf is gonna

19:44.826 --> 19:46.785
live out the rest of his
life without our involvement.

19:48.087 --> 19:51.013
- Veronica?
- I can't promise that, Ted.

19:51.048 --> 19:53.469
You never know when we
might need an elderly dwarf.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.498
Hey.

20:01.532 --> 20:03.105
Listen, uh, I just looked over the specs

20:03.140 --> 20:04.497
that you gave me with my guys,

20:04.532 --> 20:06.070
and there's some really
good stuff here, man.

20:06.105 --> 20:09.189
- So thanks.
- Oh. Well, you're welcome.

20:09.224 --> 20:12.001
So maybe next time we can, uh,

20:12.036 --> 20:13.977
try not to undermine each other so much.

20:14.012 --> 20:15.769
That's what I'm thinking.

20:15.804 --> 20:18.833
- Really?
- Yeah. Maybe we can even be friends.

20:18.868 --> 20:20.975
Yeah. I... I'd like that.

20:21.010 --> 20:22.860
Great. Oh, I just remembered...

20:22.895 --> 20:24.391
I found out that you
tried to rig the testing

20:24.426 --> 20:25.575
with your own daughter.

20:25.610 --> 20:28.099
So we can't be friends,
'cause you're a douche.

20:28.134 --> 20:30.037
Yeah, well, maybe I don't
want to be your friend either.

20:30.072 --> 20:33.717
You hear that? Even a douche
doesn't want to be your friend!

20:35.145 --> 20:37.346
I'm not proud of that.

20:37.381 --> 20:39.245
And then we went back to his place.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.308
I mean, he was my cousin's husband,

20:41.343 --> 20:44.278
and I knew it was wrong,
but they were splitting up.

20:44.313 --> 20:46.325
And you know how it is
when you're ovulating.

20:46.360 --> 20:49.902
Okay. I think we've heard enough
about not doing bad things.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.517
See? We're out of here in five minutes.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.123
Told you that would work.

20:56.305 --> 21:02.773
