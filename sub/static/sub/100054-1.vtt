Authorities are advising

02:17.049 --> 02:19.443

03:04.358 --> 03:06.925
Every time there's a storm,

03:06.969 --> 03:09.014
there's a run on supplies.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.678
- Timmy Grenadine.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.420
I thought we were the only ones
thickheaded enough

03:23.464 --> 03:24.987
to be out here in this weather.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.684
- MRS. PARMALEE:
I'm sorry, Timmy.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.948

Supreme, Mrs. Parmalee?

03:33.648 --> 03:34.866
- For your daddy?

03:38.653 --> 03:40.002
- I'll go get it.

03:42.657 --> 03:45.921
- Ain't seen a storm like
this one come through since...

03:45.964 --> 03:48.837
when was it? '58?

03:48.880 --> 03:50.317
Maybe '59?

03:53.015 --> 03:55.104
I remember it was right around
the time the love of your life

03:55.147 --> 03:56.497
walked out on ya.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.762
She said it wasn't you.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.938
It was the weather.
- DOC:

04:02.981 --> 04:04.983
Then you should be grateful
that she did walk out on me

04:05.027 --> 04:06.333
'cause you wouldn't have had
nobody to hang out with

04:06.376 --> 04:08.073
the last 20 years.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.727
- And you got a point!

04:09.771 --> 04:11.642
- Every night you two
egg each other on.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.212
There's no point in
going on about the past.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.127
- Better than the present.
- Yeah, that's right.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.221
- DOC: Times have come and gone.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.789

be the last nail in the coffin.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.316
- Chief, I thought you
were gonna get rid of

04:33.360 --> 04:35.231
my mold problem for me.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.364

04:46.373 --> 04:49.680

have been missing since--

04:49.724 --> 04:51.203
- Is everything okay?

04:53.075 --> 04:54.816
- My daddy...

04:54.859 --> 04:56.818
h-he's changed.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.515
- What's wrong?

04:58.559 --> 04:59.908
- I don't know.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.562
I-I can't say.
He's real sick.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.609
I don't wanna go back.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.525
Please.
I never want to go back.

05:08.569 --> 05:11.702
- Oh, sweetheart, you
don't have to go back.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.881
You just stay right here.

05:16.925 --> 05:17.882

05:17.926 --> 05:19.884

05:19.928 --> 05:23.105

to that boy's father.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.586
Find out what's
going on with Richie.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.457
- CHIEF: Tell you what, son.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.720
You stay here with
Ms. Parmalee, alright?

05:29.764 --> 05:32.157
And, uh, me and Doc will
take that case of beer.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.769
We'll go over and,
uh, see your daddy.

05:34.812 --> 05:35.900
- No!

05:38.163 --> 05:40.775
I-I mean...

05:40.818 --> 05:42.342
would you?

05:43.691 --> 05:46.084
Would you really do
that, Mr. Connors?

05:46.128 --> 05:47.782
- Of course I would, son.

05:49.174 --> 05:50.350
Of course.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.439
- MRS. PARMALEE: Well,
now, look at you.

05:52.482 --> 05:55.616
He ain't been feeding
you very much, has he?

05:55.659 --> 05:57.487
You come on over
here and sit down.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.576
I'm gonna get you
a nice warm meal.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.282

got that boy so spooked?

06:10.326 --> 06:11.632
- I don't know.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.287
- But I can tell you, I haven't
seen a look like that since

06:15.331 --> 06:17.551
George Kelso.
- George who?

06:17.594 --> 06:19.683
- George Kelso.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.251
Years ago, he saw
something in the sewers

06:22.294 --> 06:23.861
that spooked
the bejesus out of him.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.475
- CHIEF: Shit!

06:28.518 --> 06:29.998
- MRS. PARMALEE:
Must've made landfall.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.870
- CHIEF: I remember something
that my daddy used to say to me.

06:32.914 --> 06:38.746
He'd say, "Son, there are things
in the corners of this world

06:38.789 --> 06:42.271
"that if you look 'em
right in the face,

06:42.314 --> 06:44.404
they'll drive you insane."

06:44.447 --> 06:46.275
- That poor boy.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.798
It was a night just like this.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.192
Momma and Poppa had
a hell of a fight.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.499
Martha ran out into that storm.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.023
Richie's never been
the same since.

06:55.066 --> 06:58.113
- Alright, let's do this.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.245
Go on now so we don't get
caught in the thick of it.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.030
- Dixie? We'll be back
in a few minutes.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.771
- MRS. PARMALEE:
You be careful, boys.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.688
- Damn storm.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.440
- Go on.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.146
Now...

07:31.189 --> 07:33.365
why don't we start
at the beginning?

07:33.409 --> 07:35.193
- Nothin' to tell,
Mrs. Parmalee.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.499
- Nothin' to tell?

07:38.501 --> 07:41.461
Timmy, when I was your tutor,

07:41.504 --> 07:44.681
what did I always
tell you about math?

07:44.725 --> 07:48.119
For every problem,
there is a solution.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.556
Well, life's just like that.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.213
What's been eatin' at you?

07:57.520 --> 08:02.264
- All started a few
years ago, after...

08:02.307 --> 08:05.006
- MRS. PARMALEE:
Your momma died.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.398
- TIMMY: We buried
her on a Tuesday.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.707
My daddy wouldn't
talk to anyone but me.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.630
Why don't you go
back inside, Son?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.989
- TIMMY: Daddy always taught
me that a real man don't cry.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.957
- And that's when he
took up the bottle?

08:43.000 --> 08:47.265
- He always liked his Friday
night beers, ain't gonna lie.

08:47.309 --> 08:52.444
But after a while, every
night was Friday to him.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.577
As soon as he'd come home,
he'd have to have his Harrow's.

08:56.361 --> 08:59.147
He said it helped him put
the long day behind him.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.931
Otherwise, work
would grind him down.

09:03.151 --> 09:07.198
After a while, everything
seemed to grind him down.

09:07.242 --> 09:09.244
Argument on the factory floor.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.811
Late on the rent.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.334
Pick-up needs a new alternator.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.642
And then it wasn't just nights.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.426
They caught him
drinkin' on the job.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.863
They gave him his papers.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.257
I don't want you to think
I'm speakin' poorly of my daddy.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.998
He was always good to me.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.739
But all that seemed to...

09:25.782 --> 09:27.044
I don't know...

09:27.088 --> 09:28.742
just kinda fade away.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.534
- Is everything okay, Daddy?

09:41.798 --> 09:43.626
- I know I've been...

09:43.670 --> 09:44.888
no good.

09:47.325 --> 09:48.849
And I'm sorry.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.553
- I'm gonna quit.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.121
I promise.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.426
You gotta believe me.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.431
I will be your
daddy again, okay?

10:18.313 --> 10:19.880
- But that didn't
happen, did it?

10:21.708 --> 10:26.277
Oh, Timmy, I am so sorry.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.279
To see your daddy
change like that--

10:28.323 --> 10:30.281
- Change?

10:30.325 --> 10:32.936
Mrs. Parmalee...

10:32.980 --> 10:35.547
that--that was
just the beginning.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.819
- MRS. PARMALEE: I think there's
something more about your daddy

10:45.862 --> 10:47.255
you wanted to share.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.999
- He became good
for only one thing.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.827
- What's that?

10:53.870 --> 10:55.219
- Drinkin' contests.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.224
It's how we paid
our bills, you see.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.792
- MRS. PARMALEE:
- TIMMY: Until...

11:02.836 --> 11:05.708
one day in October,
after winning big...

11:09.799 --> 11:11.583
- I'm gonna quit one day.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.150
I promise.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.175
- RICHIE: Christ Jesus!

11:40.221 --> 11:41.309
- What--what's that, Daddy?

11:47.445 --> 11:48.795
- TIMMY: You okay, Daddy?

12:15.560 --> 12:21.436
- RICHIE:

12:43.023 --> 12:44.372
- TIMMY: I swear,
it smelled like something

12:44.415 --> 12:45.765
crawled in there and died.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.992
- RICHIE:

13:08.657 --> 13:10.702
- TIMMY: Two days later,
I come home from school

13:10.746 --> 13:14.010
and I find my daddy doing
something he never done...

13:14.054 --> 13:17.057
watching afternoon tearjerkers.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.667
- It's too darn bright in here.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.364
Why don't you go ahead and
close the shade for your daddy?

13:24.934 --> 13:28.285
- While you're at it, go fetch
me another case of Harrow's.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.141
- TIMMY: And that's
what it became.

13:58.185 --> 14:01.405
Every day after school, I'd have
to get him his Harrow's Supreme.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.977
- TIMMY: I wouldn't
dare go home without it.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.636
- TIMMY: It seemed like he'd
never leave that chair of his.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.899
He was always
watchin' those soaps.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.859
- RICHIE: Timmy!

14:23.732 --> 14:25.821
- Yeah, Daddy?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.519
- I need you to
turn off that light.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.391
- I'm-I'm just trying
to do my homework.

14:30.434 --> 14:31.827
- You questioning
your daddy, are you?

14:34.264 --> 14:35.483
You want a whippin'?

14:36.963 --> 14:39.574
Go study at your
good-for-nothin' friend's house.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.271
- Sure, Daddy.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.755
- Before you go,
blanket up these windows.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.106
- Daddy...

14:52.674 --> 14:55.807
you ever miss Momma?

14:55.851 --> 14:59.594
'Cause I really miss her.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.726
- Go on, now.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.120
Time's a-wastin'.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.131
- Timmy...

15:15.175 --> 15:17.481
you have to tell me what's
happenin' with your daddy

15:17.525 --> 15:19.179
so we can get him help.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.492
- DOC: Yeah, this is it.
- CHIEF: Thank Christ.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.799
Richie's on the second floor.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.251
- CHIEF: Hello?

15:49.513 --> 15:51.994
Anybody here?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.911
- CHIEF: It's hot in there.
- DOC: Damn.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.612
- Oh, damn!

16:01.656 --> 16:03.788
- Goddamn Gaiteau,
son of a bitch landlord's

16:03.832 --> 16:06.835
got the radiator
goin' in September.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.365
- Hey, Richard,
we got your beer!

16:18.194 --> 16:19.804
- Gaiteau did that?

16:29.031 --> 16:30.685
- CHIEF: What do you think
happened here?

16:33.731 --> 16:36.691
- DOC: Damned if I know.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.258
Where did you get that?

16:40.738 --> 16:42.218
- CHIEF: Go on.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.191
- Oh, what the hell?

17:02.760 --> 17:06.025
- E-e-easy there, Chief.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.243
Are you okay?

17:07.287 --> 17:08.940
- Yeah, I'm okay.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.246
- Just take it slow.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.770
- It's just so damn hot in here.
- Yeah, breathe.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.175
- Richie?

17:28.569 --> 17:29.918
Richie?

17:32.921 --> 17:33.922
You up here?

17:56.988 --> 17:57.859
- Richie?

17:59.556 --> 18:01.515
- He started demanding
I heat up his Harrow's.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.041
He wanted the radiators
on at full blast.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.176
One day...

18:10.219 --> 18:13.527
I come home, and my daddy...

18:13.570 --> 18:16.878
- Turn on the lights, Son.

18:16.921 --> 18:20.838
- TIMMY: He's all wrapped up
in my blanket from head to toe.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.540
- Daddy, what's
happened to you?

18:26.583 --> 18:29.456
- I don't know.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.979
It don't hurt.

18:31.022 --> 18:34.983
It feels...kinda nice.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.116
- I'm gonna call the doc.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.075
- Don't you dare,
or I'll touch you,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.121
and you'll look--

18:42.164 --> 18:43.774
--like this.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.654
- Richie?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.446
- Hey, Richie, it's Doc here.

19:03.490 --> 19:04.926
- You alright?

19:09.626 --> 19:10.932
- Ooh.
- CHIEF:

19:10.975 --> 19:13.630
- Oh, man,
it smells bad in here.

19:16.416 --> 19:19.549
- DOC: What...is goin' on?

19:19.593 --> 19:22.770
- CHIEF: Oh my god. Oh.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.989
It's 100 degrees in here.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.477
- CHIEF: Richie?

19:34.521 --> 19:36.087
Richie, where are you?

19:36.131 --> 19:37.872
- No, I can't!
I can't, please!

19:37.915 --> 19:39.265
Please, Mrs. Parmalee,
don't make me!

19:39.308 --> 19:40.875
- He's in pain.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.356
Your momma would
want you to tell me.

19:43.399 --> 19:44.531
You know she would.

19:55.411 --> 19:58.022
- His thirst--

19:58.066 --> 20:01.635
- --it--it grew.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.563
- TIMMY: He wanted...

20:16.606 --> 20:18.695
more.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.915
More than just beer.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.841
- You don't understand.

20:33.884 --> 20:34.885
It's not what
he's gone and done.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.322
It's what he's going to do!

20:38.498 --> 20:39.847
- What he's going to do?

20:41.588 --> 20:42.589
What--

20:42.632 --> 20:44.504
Oh god!

20:44.547 --> 20:46.549
- There were
no more supplies.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.377
His appetite's grown.
First it was the animals.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.553
And then...

20:50.597 --> 20:52.903
I didn't know what
to do, you see?

20:52.947 --> 20:54.470
Everyone left town
because of the storm.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.473
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.345
You have to understand.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.390
- Chief!
- Doc?

21:01.434 --> 21:03.000
- TIMMY: Nothing could stop him.

21:03.044 --> 21:06.308
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.745
- TIMMY: I brought them to him.

21:08.789 --> 21:11.008
- No, no, no, no.

21:11.052 --> 21:13.315
We gotta get out of here.
Chief, we gotta go.

21:16.492 --> 21:17.885
- CHIEF: Let's get out of here.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.931
- He was so hungry.

21:23.456 --> 21:26.894
- Timothy...

21:26.937 --> 21:28.939
what is he going to do?

21:35.381 --> 21:38.253
- Richie! Get out here.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.168
You're under arrest.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.517
Richie!

21:42.997 --> 21:45.521
Get out here now.

22:00.057 --> 22:00.971
- Oh!

22:08.414 --> 22:10.807
- Doc! Doc, help!

22:10.851 --> 22:12.505
Doc!

22:27.824 --> 22:29.043
- No!

22:38.531 --> 22:40.184
- Why?

22:42.230 --> 22:43.927
- He promised me
he was gonna quit.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.976
He's my daddy.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.760
I love him.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.633
- DOC: We have to
get out of here!

22:53.676 --> 22:54.721
- MRS. PARMALEE:
They're multiplying!

22:54.764 --> 22:56.636
- DOC: We have to
get out of town!

22:56.679 --> 22:58.551
- MRS. PARMALEE:
How long do we have?

22:58.594 --> 23:00.248
- TIMMY: I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.510
- MRS. PARMALEE:
It can't be right!

23:01.554 --> 23:03.382
It can't be!
- DOC: It wasn't stopping.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.731
It just kept growing!

23:04.774 --> 23:07.255
- Time! Time!
We have no time!

23:07.298 --> 23:08.387
- We need to go!

23:09.953 --> 23:11.694
- Oh god, please!

23:11.738 --> 23:13.479
God, no, no!

23:13.522 --> 23:15.481
- Dixie, what in the good
lord's name are you doing?

23:15.524 --> 23:17.221
We can't stop them!

23:17.265 --> 23:20.355
- TIMMY: We can't stop them!
- No! 3.8 billion!

23:20.399 --> 23:23.053
At this rate, in six days.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.229
- Six days?
Six days to what?!

23:25.273 --> 23:28.450
- The end!
The end of everything!

24:38.215 --> 24:39.826
- MARSHA: All of this house
for just three people?

24:39.869 --> 24:41.175
- EVIE: Yup.

24:41.218 --> 24:44.439
Father, mother.

24:44.483 --> 24:48.312
And then over here
in the den, Ethan.

24:50.576 --> 24:54.405
And down here in the kitchen,
we have Dane.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.587
- RANDY: And a repaired
fireplace for all.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.154
- Dad!
- RANDY: Hey!

25:04.198 --> 25:05.504
- I love it!

25:07.636 --> 25:10.291
- So you have all these
rooms to choose from.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.206
You made Ethan's bedroom
the den.

25:12.249 --> 25:14.077
- Yup.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.210
So he can stay up all night
and watch TV.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.994
- Ahh.
- Oh, well.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.388
Now imagine her
as a teenager.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.476
- This is really great, Evie,

25:21.520 --> 25:23.260
but I've gotta
get you to school.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.914
- Goodbye, the "Smithsmiths."

25:24.958 --> 25:26.437
- RANDY: The "Smithsmiths," huh?

25:26.481 --> 25:29.049
- That's their name.
- Okay.

25:29.092 --> 25:31.399
Sounds more like a--
like a stutter than a name.

25:31.442 --> 25:35.490
Okay, okay,
the Smithsmiths it is.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.405
- EVIE: Wait!
I have to feed Dane!

25:37.448 --> 25:38.537
- MARSHA: Honey, come on!

25:38.580 --> 25:40.060
You don't want
to be late for school.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.941
- Like that!
- Dad! No!

25:51.985 --> 25:54.422
No, here!
- RANDY:

26:07.000 --> 26:08.218
- Hi, Daddy!

26:15.661 --> 26:17.227
Hey!

26:17.271 --> 26:18.707
How was school, kiddo?

26:18.751 --> 26:19.839
- Good.

26:22.189 --> 26:23.625
- Don't forget, we have
our mommy/daughter date.

26:23.669 --> 26:24.800
- Yay!

26:57.877 --> 26:59.443
- Who are you?

27:09.845 --> 27:11.499
- Who are you?

27:13.414 --> 27:15.808
I didn't put you there.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.897
How did you get there?

27:17.940 --> 27:19.333
- MARSHA: Evie?

27:23.032 --> 27:25.644
- Weren't you two laying down?

27:25.687 --> 27:27.776
Are you guys worried
about something?

27:36.829 --> 27:38.395
- Ethan?

27:43.357 --> 27:45.141
- EVIE: Are you okay?

27:55.064 --> 27:57.023
- Who moved you guys?

28:12.429 --> 28:14.127
- Yuck!

28:14.170 --> 28:15.911
- MARSHA: Evie!
Let's get a move on!

28:15.955 --> 28:17.217
- Coming!

28:17.260 --> 28:18.697
- MARSHA: Don't wanna
miss the previews.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.048
- Nobody move again.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.024
- Hi, Dad.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.156
- Hey.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.768
How was the movie?

28:46.812 --> 28:48.335
- The movie was great.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.076
I gotta go. Good night!

28:50.119 --> 28:52.034
- Uh...

28:52.078 --> 28:54.123
good night to you too.
- Good night, Mom!

28:54.167 --> 28:55.429
- MARSHA: Good night, darling.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.839
- Whoa.

29:27.722 --> 29:29.680
- Who let you out?

30:23.038 --> 30:25.040
- EVIE: What are you
doing in this house?

30:25.084 --> 30:26.650
You don't belong here.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.047
Smithsmiths,
I think you're haunted.

31:01.468 --> 31:04.253
- I know, we spoil her.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.516
- That's our favorite
kind of parent.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.041
- She loves your dollhouse.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.738
- MAN: She should.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.740
It's one of a kind.

31:12.783 --> 31:14.350
- Yeah. Randy thinks
it's a good idea

31:14.394 --> 31:16.004
for her to play with dolls.

31:16.048 --> 31:19.051
Says it's good for
building her identity.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.791
- MAN: He's right.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.881
They still haven't come up
with a better way for a child

31:22.924 --> 31:26.058
to figure out
who they really are.

31:26.101 --> 31:29.191
- I guess that's why
they call them figurines.

31:29.235 --> 31:31.672
- And they don't typically like
to tell you about it, either.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.195
- Tell you about what?

31:33.239 --> 31:35.415
- What they're figuring out.

31:43.292 --> 31:45.164
- Really? That one?

32:28.337 --> 32:29.599
- Here, guys.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.085
- He'll get to
the bottom of this, Ethan.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.616
- Where are you?

32:46.660 --> 32:48.531
- MARSHA: Evie!
Time for dinner!

32:53.536 --> 32:55.756
- I have to go eat dinner too.

32:55.799 --> 32:58.672
Don't move.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.456
And be careful.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.020
- EVIE: I thought I told
you guys not to move.

33:44.370 --> 33:47.025
You're looking for the head.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.548
Find it.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.336
- What's going on in here?

33:56.295 --> 33:59.211
Hm.
- He's investigating.

33:59.254 --> 34:01.822
- Investigating what?

34:01.865 --> 34:04.564
Looks like he's--
he's searching for rats.

34:04.607 --> 34:07.610
- Yeah. Rats.

34:07.654 --> 34:12.006
- Well--ah, well, Dane
would've eaten them by now.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.529
Try to wrap it up
soon, okay, baby?

34:13.573 --> 34:14.878
Bedtime.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.711
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

34:21.755 --> 34:23.235
What's this for?

34:23.278 --> 34:25.759
- I love you, Daddy.

34:25.802 --> 34:28.066
- And I love you, Evie.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.068
Good night.

34:34.637 --> 34:36.639
- And good night to
the Smithsmiths too.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.362
- Oh my god.

35:39.528 --> 35:43.228
- Stay away
from the Smithsmiths!

35:43.271 --> 35:44.838
And stay away from me too!

35:52.802 --> 35:54.108
- I have to help them.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.807
- A priest or a rabbi?

35:57.851 --> 35:59.679
- I don't have either.

35:59.722 --> 36:02.508
- I don't think I've
ever stocked those.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.814
They might have one at
a church or a temple.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.860
One of those places
use toys to explain

36:06.903 --> 36:09.689
the testaments
and whatnot. Uh...

36:11.517 --> 36:13.040
- What do you need them for?

36:13.083 --> 36:14.476
- I need something spiritual.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.178
- We do have some
Native American toys.

36:20.221 --> 36:23.093
They're a very
spiritual people, Evie.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.269
Probably more spiritual

36:24.312 --> 36:27.097
than any priest or rabbi
you'll ever meet.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.114
- Perfect.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.103
- EVIE: Do something!

37:16.146 --> 37:17.539
- MARSHA: Evie?

37:17.583 --> 37:18.932
Come watch a movie with us.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.890
- There's something that--

37:20.934 --> 37:23.284
- I'm sure your toys can
take care of themselves.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.334
- EVIE: He'll protect us.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.466
Good luck.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.859
Coming!

39:16.876 --> 39:18.704
- EVIE: You're looking for it.

39:53.826 --> 39:56.045
- EVIE: Do you think the head
is out of the dollhouse?

40:02.748 --> 40:03.923
- No!

40:14.020 --> 40:16.239
- EVIE: Look out!

40:16.283 --> 40:17.893
- MARSHA: Evie?

40:31.298 --> 40:34.083
- Evie? Did you
have a bad dream?

40:34.127 --> 40:37.043
- What?
No, I'm okay.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.828
- You screamed, honey.
- I did?

40:39.872 --> 40:43.397
- Yes, you woke us up.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.181
Do you wanna come
sleep with us tonight?

40:47.227 --> 40:48.620
- EVIE: No.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.627
- You know it's okay
to be scared, right?

40:55.670 --> 40:57.150
- Yeah.

40:57.193 --> 40:59.152
- And if you have
another bad dream,

40:59.195 --> 41:01.284
all you have to do is come
crawl into bed with us.

41:03.939 --> 41:05.767
I love you.
- I love you too.

41:33.316 --> 41:35.014
- Oh, no.

41:41.890 --> 41:43.196
- EVIE: Ethan?

41:43.239 --> 41:47.461
Where are you?

41:52.771 --> 41:54.860
- EVIE: Ethan!

42:05.740 --> 42:08.177
- I can't leave that
thing in my room.

42:49.479 --> 42:50.829
- EVIE:

42:51.786 --> 42:53.135
No!

43:02.710 --> 43:04.146
- You don't belong out here!

43:04.190 --> 43:06.061
Get back in there!

43:14.330 --> 43:16.681
No more.

43:16.724 --> 43:18.291
No more of the head.

43:29.868 --> 43:31.696
- You're absolutely sure?

43:34.220 --> 43:36.439
- Maybe she's just growing up.

43:36.483 --> 43:38.093
- Yeah.

43:43.272 --> 43:47.146
- Oh, this is one of a kind.

43:47.189 --> 43:48.538
- RANDY: Our daughter
says she's over it.

43:50.105 --> 43:51.541
You know how kids are.

43:51.585 --> 43:52.760
One minute, the houses
are everything.

43:52.804 --> 43:56.024
The next, you're supposed
to throw it away.

43:56.068 --> 43:58.200
- WOMAN: That would be a shame.

43:58.244 --> 43:59.462
- Thank you.
