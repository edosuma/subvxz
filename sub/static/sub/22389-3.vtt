00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
[jazz music]

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
â™ª â™ª

00:18.929 --> 00:20.500
[cheers and applause]

00:20.500 --> 00:24.000
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.329
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:27.329 --> 00:35.329
â™ª â™ª

00:39.000 --> 00:40.200
- Thank you.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.399
[cheers and applause]

00:42.399 --> 00:44.500
Welcome to "Penn & Teller:
Fool Us,"

00:44.500 --> 00:47.100
where magicians get
the once-in-a-lifetime chance

00:47.100 --> 00:51.000
to pull one over on the masters
of magic, Penn and Teller.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.600
If they can do it,
they'll win a slot performing

00:53.600 --> 00:55.369
as part
of their world-famous show

00:55.369 --> 00:57.229
here in Las Vegas.

00:57.229 --> 00:59.030
But it's not gonna be easy.

00:59.030 --> 01:02.200
These guys not only know
almost every trick

01:02.200 --> 01:05.200
in the book, they've written
a few of the books themselves.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.870
So please welcome
Penn and Teller.

01:08.870 --> 01:16.870
â™ª â™ª

01:16.870 --> 01:20.200
[cheers and applause]

01:20.200 --> 01:22.170
Oh! Oh!

01:27.370 --> 01:29.430
Okay, before Penn and Teller
get comfy,

01:29.430 --> 01:32.069
we're gonna spring
our first magician on them.

01:32.069 --> 01:33.069
Take a look.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.400
- Hello, I'm Rob Ramirez,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.030
and I'm a really good
close-up magician.

01:40.030 --> 01:43.170
I am 100% Mexican, proud.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.530
[upbeat music]

01:45.530 --> 01:49.170
I hope all the Mexican people
now see me on camera and go,

01:49.170 --> 01:51.069
"I want to do that too."

01:51.069 --> 01:54.729
I'd say my two passions
are musical theater and magic.

01:54.729 --> 01:56.099
[percussive music]

01:56.099 --> 01:58.400
There are beats in magic
that you really have to find,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.170
and know, and understand,
and follow the rhythm.

02:01.170 --> 02:03.769
It's the same thing with tap,
with jazz, with ballet.

02:03.769 --> 02:05.069
It's not just about the moves,

02:05.069 --> 02:06.700
but it's really
the musicality of it.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.598
I think everyone belongs
in the magic community

02:09.598 --> 02:12.000
because it really isn't about
what you look like,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
it's about what you're bringing
to the table.

02:16.870 --> 02:20.170
[cheers and applause]

02:20.170 --> 02:24.370
- Please welcome Robert Ramirez.

02:24.370 --> 02:25.930
- Hello, hello.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.069
Oh, man.

02:27.069 --> 02:28.270
I can't believe
I'm finally here.

02:28.270 --> 02:30.329
So close to you guys.

02:30.329 --> 02:32.270
Today, we're gonna play
the ultimate

02:32.270 --> 02:36.099
in high-level,
intellectual mind games...

02:36.099 --> 02:39.170
Tic-tac-toe.

02:39.170 --> 02:42.069
A game where you really need
to know your opponents.

02:42.069 --> 02:44.900
And trust me,
nobody knows Penn and Teller

02:44.900 --> 02:46.770
like I do.

02:46.770 --> 02:50.370
First, I have written down
the outcome of the game

02:50.370 --> 02:52.870
on this piece of paper.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.530
Now, I'm not a mind reader,
but like I said,

02:55.530 --> 02:58.569
nobody knows Penn and Teller
like I do.

03:00.569 --> 03:01.770
Coin toss.

03:01.770 --> 03:03.530
I need you
to check this quarter,

03:03.530 --> 03:05.069
make sure it's normal.

03:05.069 --> 03:07.569
- I sure--I sure will.

03:07.569 --> 03:08.669
- Is it a normal quarter?

03:08.669 --> 03:10.099
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.

03:10.099 --> 03:12.199
What you're gonna do in a second
is you're gonna flip that coin.

03:12.199 --> 03:15.330
If you win the coin toss,
you get to decide who plays me

03:15.330 --> 03:18.400
in the ultimate game
of tic-tac-toe, you or Teller.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.569
- Wonderful.
- If you lose the coin toss,

03:20.569 --> 03:22.270
Teller decides your fate.
- Okay.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.530
- So, before you flip the coin,
do you want heads or tails?

03:25.530 --> 03:27.370
- I would like heads.
- Heads.

03:27.370 --> 03:29.000
I knew you'd pick heads.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.099
- I knew you did.
- Yeah, 'cause the other day,

03:30.099 --> 03:32.500
when you were getting
your decaffed ice Americano,

03:32.500 --> 03:34.229
the cashier
was handing you the change.

03:34.229 --> 03:35.729
Quarter fell out of her hand

03:35.729 --> 03:37.770
and landed on the counter
facing heads.

03:37.770 --> 03:40.170
So, flip the coin,
heads or tails.

03:40.170 --> 03:43.670
He called heads, it is...
- It's heads.

03:43.670 --> 03:45.170
- Heads, you win.
Which means you decide.

03:45.170 --> 03:46.770
Do you want to play
or do you want Teller to play?

03:46.770 --> 03:48.170
- Oh, I want Teller to play.

03:48.170 --> 03:50.000
- Round of applause for Teller
as he comes on up here.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
[cheers and applause]

03:57.170 --> 03:58.500
Now, Teller, we get
to play for the stakes,

03:58.500 --> 04:00.669
and you get to choose
what we're playing for.

04:00.669 --> 04:03.270
It's either cold, hard cash...

04:03.270 --> 04:06.199
[audience oohs and ahhs]

04:06.199 --> 04:10.099
Or this cute, adorable puppy.

04:10.099 --> 04:12.770
[light applause]

04:12.770 --> 04:16.000
Now, this is Brownie.
I got him from the pound.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.069
I saved him
from being euthanized.

04:18.069 --> 04:19.199
Temporarily.

04:19.199 --> 04:21.029
- [laughs]

04:21.029 --> 04:24.029
- You see, Teller...

04:24.029 --> 04:27.199
if you don't choose
the puppy, well...

04:29.069 --> 04:30.000
- Go for the cash!

04:30.000 --> 04:32.329
- So, Teller, would you
like cold, hard cash...

04:32.329 --> 04:33.670
- Go for the cash!

04:33.670 --> 04:36.230
- Or...

04:36.230 --> 04:38.769
Or the life of this cute,
adorable puppy?

04:38.769 --> 04:40.899
Which is it?

04:40.899 --> 04:43.069
- [sighs]

04:43.069 --> 04:44.370
- The puppy?

04:44.370 --> 04:45.569
[cheers and applause]

04:45.569 --> 04:47.100
- Boo!

04:47.100 --> 04:49.000
You suck!

04:50.329 --> 04:53.870
- Now, Teller,
I knew you'd pick the puppy.

04:53.870 --> 04:56.600
Because on Monday, April 4th,
you were in Los Angeles,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.199
and you were walking
to the Magic Castle.

04:58.199 --> 05:00.129
And you passed by
three puppies.

05:00.129 --> 05:01.899
And you pet all of them.

05:01.899 --> 05:03.730
So I knew you would pick him.

05:03.730 --> 05:07.069
Alyson, will you please
come help me?

05:07.069 --> 05:08.829
Will you hold Brownie
while we play the game?

05:08.829 --> 05:11.699
- Yes!
Oh...

05:11.699 --> 05:14.500
- Now, Teller, the only way
to save that puppy

05:14.500 --> 05:16.199
is you have to win.

05:16.199 --> 05:18.430
You can't tie.
You can't lose.

05:18.430 --> 05:20.870
So...
[grunts]

05:23.069 --> 05:25.370
One final question.

05:25.370 --> 05:27.829
Would you like to play
with the red marker

05:27.829 --> 05:29.899
or the blue marker?

05:29.899 --> 05:32.029
The red?
I knew you would choose red.

05:32.029 --> 05:33.930
Because when you pull out
of your driveway

05:33.930 --> 05:36.069
in your Tesla,
you always turn right.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.670
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.170
Pushes--you always turn right.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.170
There you go.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.029
- [laughs]

05:44.029 --> 05:46.000
- Ladies and gentlemen,

05:46.000 --> 05:50.029
the ultimate game
of tic-tac-toe.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.730
- Really?
Oh.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.029
- No, you can't put X if I'm X.

05:56.029 --> 05:58.230
You have to be Os.

05:58.230 --> 06:00.170
Teller, have you ever played
tic-tac-toe before?

06:00.170 --> 06:02.069
Or was it a rough childhood?
Okay, okay, okay.

06:02.069 --> 06:04.100
- Muah.
[smooches]

06:04.100 --> 06:08.600
This is the most fascinating
game to watch on TV, isn't it?

06:08.600 --> 06:12.670
Tic-tac-toe, but at least
I get to hold a puppy.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.529
Oh.
Oh.

06:14.529 --> 06:17.899
Oh, that's so sweet.

06:17.899 --> 06:21.199
This is why tic-tac-toe
has never been

06:21.199 --> 06:22.600
a nighttime show.

06:24.529 --> 06:25.670
- It's a tie!

06:25.670 --> 06:28.269
I knew it!
- Huh.

06:28.269 --> 06:29.569
- Too bad you didn't save
the puppy.

06:29.569 --> 06:31.829
- Oh, no.

06:31.829 --> 06:33.329
Don't listen.
Don't listen.

06:33.329 --> 06:34.829
- Should've gone for the cash!

06:34.829 --> 06:37.829
[laughter and applause]

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
- Now I knew exactly how
this game

06:41.000 --> 06:42.329
was gonna play out, Teller,

06:42.329 --> 06:45.199
because I have written down
a prediction.

06:48.269 --> 06:53.000
It says, "The game is a tie."

06:53.000 --> 06:56.730
[light cheers and applause]

06:56.730 --> 06:58.170
That's all right.
That's all right.

06:58.170 --> 07:00.230
You see, I actually knew
in great detail

07:00.230 --> 07:02.069
how this game would play out
because I wrote,

07:02.069 --> 07:06.930
"Penn wins coin toss,
Teller plays.

07:06.930 --> 07:09.170
"He picks red,

07:09.170 --> 07:13.670
and too bad you didn't save
the puppy."

07:13.670 --> 07:16.269
But, not only--will you
please hold this, Teller?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.829
Not only did I know
every single decision

07:18.829 --> 07:20.899
that would be made, exactly
how the game would play out,

07:20.899 --> 07:24.370
and where you were last week...

07:24.370 --> 07:26.199
- Oh, dear.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.829
- But when I woke up today...

07:30.829 --> 07:32.870
- Don't look, puppy.

07:32.870 --> 07:36.730
- I drew on my boxers...

07:36.730 --> 07:41.069
the game, exactly as it's
played out, move for move.

07:41.069 --> 07:46.029
The ultimate game
of tic-tac-toe!

07:46.029 --> 07:48.069
Thank you so much, Teller.
Thank you.

07:48.069 --> 07:49.529
- Wow.

07:49.529 --> 07:53.199
Robert Ramirez,
ladies and gentleman!

07:53.199 --> 07:56.329
Ohh!

07:56.329 --> 08:01.269
Oh, and I got myself
a new puppy.

08:01.269 --> 08:03.269
- Well, I mean, you can get him

08:03.269 --> 08:05.000
from the pound if you want.
He's gonna be there.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.600
- Well, I'm certainly
not giving him back to you

08:06.600 --> 08:08.569
if you're gonna threaten
his little life.

08:08.569 --> 08:10.930
- I won't. He's too adorable.
- Well, all right, buddy.

08:10.930 --> 08:12.699
Wait, don't eat the microphone.
Okay, I'll give him to you.

08:12.699 --> 08:14.930
- I don't think he can eat that.
I don't think he should--

08:14.930 --> 08:16.370
- All right. All right.
He's very cute.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.170
I think he might have
just farted.

08:18.170 --> 08:20.230
But...

08:20.230 --> 08:22.230
- I think, yeah, he did.

08:22.230 --> 08:24.230
Yeah. You farted.
You farted.

08:24.230 --> 08:25.670
- Oh, that's another trick

08:25.670 --> 08:28.029
you have up your sleeve, huh?
Blame it on the puppy.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.730
- My leg sleeve.
- Right.

08:29.730 --> 08:31.829
All right, well,
before he gnaws your arm off,

08:31.829 --> 08:33.169
let's go to Penn and Teller.

08:33.169 --> 08:34.929
- Okay, great.
- Oh, boy!

08:34.929 --> 08:37.429
You know, that's a good routine.
- Thank you.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.100
- And I may be the only one

08:39.100 --> 08:41.269
in the room that's not
a big fan of puppies.

08:41.269 --> 08:43.500
I would've gone
for the money in a second.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.070
- All right, we're all gonna
pretend we didn't hear that.

08:46.070 --> 08:47.169
- Okay, go ahead.

08:47.169 --> 08:48.029
Pretend you didn't hear it.

08:48.029 --> 08:51.200
You know, sometimes
we are able

08:51.200 --> 08:55.830
to figure these things out
because we are lucky.

08:55.830 --> 08:57.370
Sometimes we're able
to figure them out

08:57.370 --> 08:58.929
because we know stuff.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.500
Sometimes we're able
to figure them out

09:01.500 --> 09:04.700
because we are so stupid.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.769
Teller is so stupid

09:07.769 --> 09:10.600
that when you have him
play tic-tac-toe

09:10.600 --> 09:13.669
and you put an X in place
and hand him the marker,

09:13.669 --> 09:16.269
he also puts in an X...

09:16.269 --> 09:18.529
because he's an idiot!

09:18.529 --> 09:22.070
Now if that mistake had been
on your shorts,

09:22.070 --> 09:25.399
you would've killed us
absolutely dead.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.929
If you had the X
that then has the O around it,

09:27.929 --> 09:29.200
it would've killed us dead.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.230
One of the wonderful principles
of magic

09:32.230 --> 09:35.500
is that once the trick is done,

09:35.500 --> 09:38.169
you think that's the only way
it could've gone.

09:38.169 --> 09:40.730
And what I love about
what you've done

09:40.730 --> 09:45.570
is you've taken something
where we have many fewer choices

09:45.570 --> 09:48.370
than we think and made
it look like the choices

09:48.370 --> 09:49.570
are almost infinite.

09:49.570 --> 09:51.870
And I love that a lot.

09:51.870 --> 09:55.000
And if we're wrong about that,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.169
you can tell us to just
sit on it and rotate.

09:59.169 --> 10:00.570
[laughter]

10:00.570 --> 10:03.429
- You are right.
- Okay.

10:03.429 --> 10:06.870
So you're confident the boys
know how you did your trick.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.570
- They know
how the game was played,

10:09.570 --> 10:10.870
and they did it well.

10:10.870 --> 10:12.429
- Okay, so you--
- And you're absolutely right

10:12.429 --> 10:13.899
on what coffee I drink.

10:13.899 --> 10:15.500
It's decaffeinated Americano.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.899
Please, America, remember that.

10:17.899 --> 10:20.200
You don't want
to see me jacked up.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.830
- Okay.
So you didn't fool them.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.169
You might have
stalked them a little.

10:23.169 --> 10:24.399
But you're adorable.

10:24.399 --> 10:26.200
So is your puppy.
We love you.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.500
Thank you, Robert Ramirez.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.769
- Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:32.769 --> 10:34.730
- [laughs]

10:34.730 --> 10:38.100
[cheers and applause]

10:38.100 --> 10:39.500
- We're taking
a commercial break

10:39.500 --> 10:42.200
so I can make Penn and Teller
actually explain to me

10:42.200 --> 10:43.529
what they were just
talking about.

10:43.529 --> 10:44.830
See you in a minute.

10:44.830 --> 10:47.830
[jazz music]

10:47.830 --> 10:49.830
â™ª â™ª

10:54.669 --> 10:57.669
[jazz music]

10:57.669 --> 11:00.330
[cheers and applause]

11:00.330 --> 11:01.600
- Welcome back.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.730
Now let's see
if our next potential fooler

11:03.730 --> 11:06.200
can make foolees
out of Penn and Teller.

11:08.570 --> 11:09.570
[dramatic music]

11:09.570 --> 11:10.899
- My name is Dominik.

11:10.899 --> 11:13.429
The magic that I do is set
in a fantasy world.

11:13.429 --> 11:15.000
It's very visual.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.399
People say it's like
real magic.

11:16.399 --> 11:17.500
They call it wizardry.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.000
I like that.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.570
My father worked
for Jim Henson,

11:20.570 --> 11:22.500
and I was very inspired
by that.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.500
He created fantasy worlds.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.230
The puppeteers are magicians.

11:26.230 --> 11:30.570
They create life out
of inanimate fabric and foam.

11:30.570 --> 11:32.330
Everything I perform
is my own creation,

11:32.330 --> 11:34.529
hand-built from scratch.

11:34.529 --> 11:36.070
There is a tremendous
satisfaction

11:36.070 --> 11:38.899
that comes from imagining
an illusion or a routine

11:38.899 --> 11:40.529
and bringing it to life.

11:40.529 --> 11:42.169
The illusion that I'm gonna do
for Penn and Teller

11:42.169 --> 11:43.730
is brand-new.

11:43.730 --> 11:46.070
Nobody has ever seen anything
like this.

11:46.070 --> 11:47.169
If something goes wrong
with it,

11:47.169 --> 11:49.000
there is nothing I can do.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.200
My hands are literally tied.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.000
[cheers and applause]

11:55.000 --> 11:57.929
- Our next performer
once described himself

11:57.929 --> 11:59.700
as a boy who didn't grow up.

11:59.700 --> 12:03.230
Which means, like me, he still
sleeps in footie pajamas.

12:03.230 --> 12:06.100
Please welcome Dominik.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.330
[cheers and applause]

12:08.330 --> 12:10.200
- Hello, I'm Dominik.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.429
I'm here with Nova and Andrew.

12:12.429 --> 12:15.070
And we're gonna present
something spectacular.

12:15.070 --> 12:19.029
An escape that Houdini
didn't attempt.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.029
Because he's dead.

12:21.029 --> 12:22.600
10 pounds of sharpened steel,

12:22.600 --> 12:25.169
an old butcher's block.

12:25.169 --> 12:27.669
Imagine the horrors.

12:27.669 --> 12:30.000
All you vegans
and vegetarians,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.500
avert your eyes.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.429
This apple...

12:34.429 --> 12:35.830
is halved.

12:35.830 --> 12:37.429
Anything that gets put there

12:37.429 --> 12:39.669
will meet
with the same consequences.

12:41.769 --> 12:44.830
In a minute, that's where
my hands will go.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.830
I'm gonna be handcuffed
and shackled

12:46.830 --> 12:48.730
to that butcher's block.

12:48.730 --> 12:52.730
That rope, well, we're gonna
set that rope on fire,

12:52.730 --> 12:54.929
and I will be using a hairpin
to pick the locks

12:54.929 --> 12:58.870
and make my escape before
that rope burns through,

12:58.870 --> 13:01.600
and you saw what happened
to that apple.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.100
Imagine what would happen
to these hands.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.669
Now, one thing
that's very important is,

13:06.669 --> 13:08.899
I need to keep track of time.

13:08.899 --> 13:12.100
And I'm noticing you have
a pink band there.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.769
- I do, but no second hand.

13:13.769 --> 13:14.899
- Oh, no second hand.

13:14.899 --> 13:16.070
- Yeah, so you may be
in big trouble.

13:16.070 --> 13:18.100
- Well, you know what?

13:18.100 --> 13:20.230
I'm a professional.
I know what I'm doing.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.730
May I borrow it?

13:21.730 --> 13:23.230
- Sure.
- That'd be great.

13:23.230 --> 13:26.070
- I've got to tell you,
this watch is important to me,

13:26.070 --> 13:29.029
and if you do anything to it...
- Very sentimental?

13:29.029 --> 13:30.029
- You'll be in
a lot more trouble

13:30.029 --> 13:32.669
than that thing dropping, okay?

13:32.669 --> 13:34.500
Now your major problem is me.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.000
- Well, I'm putting my hands
at risk

13:37.000 --> 13:38.169
for your entertainment.

13:38.169 --> 13:39.200
- Good thinking.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.700
- So now you've got some skin
in the game.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.200
- I do.
- Thanks.

13:46.269 --> 13:50.529
Handcuffs.
Houdini could escape--not those.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.000
Matches the watch.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.169
Houdini could escape out
of any handcuffs.

13:54.169 --> 13:58.600
He was the king of handcuffs.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.600
I am not quite the king yet.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.870
These shackles will keep
my arms in place.

14:08.870 --> 14:12.830
This padlock will make
it impossible to get out.

14:15.029 --> 14:19.200
This hairpin
is all I will have...

14:19.200 --> 14:23.000
to pick these locks
in less than two minutes.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.929
Now, Penn, I'm gonna ask you
to help us start the time.

14:26.929 --> 14:30.700
I want you to yell, "Fire,"
and she will light the rope.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.029
And that's when I'll start
counting time.

14:33.029 --> 14:35.100
- So I'm gonna yell, "Fire,"
in a crowded theater?

14:35.100 --> 14:36.029
- If you could,
that'd be fantastic.

14:36.029 --> 14:39.169
- Okay.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.100
[audience oohs and ahhs]

14:41.100 --> 14:43.500
[cheers and applause]

14:43.500 --> 14:44.769
- So we're ready.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.769
- Fire!

14:49.769 --> 14:51.570
- Okay.

14:51.570 --> 14:54.370
Got to get in here.

14:54.370 --> 14:56.169
Sometimes this goes real quick.

14:56.169 --> 14:58.100
Other times not so much.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.929
[grunts]
Got that one.

15:00.929 --> 15:03.070
Okay, ah,
this one's behind there.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.100
It's a little difficult.

15:05.100 --> 15:08.100
[suspenseful music]

15:08.100 --> 15:13.000
â™ª â™ª

15:13.000 --> 15:14.669
Yeah, it would be good
to have seconds.

15:14.669 --> 15:16.500
[chuckles]

15:16.500 --> 15:17.769
This is the first time

15:17.769 --> 15:21.100
we're actually
doing this on television.

15:21.100 --> 15:25.730
â™ª â™ª

15:25.730 --> 15:27.669
Ah, got it.

15:27.669 --> 15:28.830
Okay.

15:28.830 --> 15:36.070
â™ª â™ª

15:36.070 --> 15:38.269
Um...shoot.

15:38.269 --> 15:39.669
Um...

15:39.669 --> 15:40.730
â™ª â™ª

15:40.730 --> 15:42.200
The pick.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.000
The pick.
I can't find the pick.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.330
No, no.
I don't know where it's at.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.669
Put out the fire.
Put out the fire.

15:46.669 --> 15:47.669
Put out the fire.

15:47.669 --> 15:51.029
â™ª â™ª

15:51.029 --> 15:54.070
I'm so sorry,
I don't know what happened.

15:54.070 --> 15:55.200
I really don't.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.370
[audience screams]

15:57.370 --> 15:59.669
â™ª â™ª

15:59.669 --> 16:03.029
- God, what--what do I do--
what?

16:03.029 --> 16:05.029
What do I do with them?
- Put the hands on ice!

16:05.029 --> 16:13.029

16:18.330 --> 16:21.330

16:27.330 --> 16:29.500
- Thank you, sir.
- Not a scratch.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.899
- Ladies and gentlemen, Dominik.

16:33.899 --> 16:36.330
[cheers and applause]

16:36.330 --> 16:39.070
Is that, is that sort
of like your nightmare?

16:39.070 --> 16:42.169
- This is completely
out of my comfort zone.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.730
I'd normally do a silent act
where I don't talk,

16:44.730 --> 16:46.200
and it's a very poignant, and--

16:46.200 --> 16:47.899
- Oh, that's nice.

16:47.899 --> 16:49.929
[laughter]

16:49.929 --> 16:52.200
- It's like a silent,
surreal movie,

16:52.200 --> 16:54.500
very visual
and meaningful magic,

16:54.500 --> 16:56.870
and this is a nightmare.

16:56.870 --> 16:58.600
[laughter]

16:58.600 --> 17:01.370
- Okay, well, it's time
to go to the boys.

17:01.370 --> 17:04.098
- This act has everything
we love in it.

17:04.098 --> 17:05.829
- Oh, fantastic.
- Just everything.

17:05.829 --> 17:08.000
I am a fire eater,
I am a juggler,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.868
so I liked your two--
your two coworkers.

17:10.868 --> 17:12.170
I loved most about you

17:12.170 --> 17:14.700
that you didn't do the trick
to her.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.598
So much of magic...
- Yes, I agree.

17:16.598 --> 17:18.098
- Is torturing women

17:18.098 --> 17:19.829
in front of Mylar
to bad Motown music.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.069
- Yes. Yes.

17:21.069 --> 17:22.569
- And you did not torture
the women,

17:22.569 --> 17:23.900
you tortured yourself.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.700
And that is not only better,
more artistic,

17:26.700 --> 17:28.930
but also sexier.

17:28.930 --> 17:30.069
- I think so.

17:30.069 --> 17:32.700
- And I also love the way
this prop looks.

17:32.700 --> 17:36.099
There's about three or four
prop builders

17:36.099 --> 17:37.200
in the United States
of America

17:37.200 --> 17:39.670
that build everything,
and it all looks the same.

17:39.670 --> 17:41.769
And this looks like a prop

17:41.769 --> 17:43.500
that doesn't look
like any of theirs.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.529
- Thank you.
- Looks like something

17:44.529 --> 17:45.670
you built yourself.
- Thank you.

17:45.670 --> 17:48.200
- And I also want to say,

17:48.200 --> 17:51.099
what's really smart about this
in terms of magic,

17:51.099 --> 17:53.369
usually dirty business,

17:53.369 --> 17:56.769
the dirty work in magic
is done in an off moment.

17:56.769 --> 17:59.029
And you chose to put
your dirty work

17:59.029 --> 18:00.930
at a moment of panic...
- Yeah.

18:00.930 --> 18:02.869
- And a moment of excitement.
- You're right.

18:02.869 --> 18:04.329
- And that's really,
really bold.

18:04.329 --> 18:06.900
And I think
it fooled everybody,

18:06.900 --> 18:09.069
you know, except us.

18:09.069 --> 18:11.170
- Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

18:11.170 --> 18:12.730
- All right, well,
you didn't fool them,

18:12.730 --> 18:14.099
but you certainly
impressed them.

18:14.099 --> 18:16.000
- Oh, oh. And most important.
- Oh!

18:16.000 --> 18:19.769
- Most important, you did not
[bleep] up my watch.

18:19.769 --> 18:21.670
It's here and doing fine.

18:21.670 --> 18:23.430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:23.430 --> 18:25.029
Dominik, everyone.
- Thank you.

18:25.029 --> 18:27.599
[cheers and applause]

18:27.599 --> 18:29.170
- Stick around and see

18:29.170 --> 18:31.029
if anyone can fool
Penn and Teller.

18:49.099 --> 18:50.329
- Welcome back.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.700
Let's see if we can finally
find a magician

18:52.700 --> 18:54.700
who can fool Penn and Teller.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.369
- Hi, my name is Joel Ward.

19:01.369 --> 19:04.099
And I am a comedy magician.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.230
[funk rock music]

19:06.230 --> 19:07.829
I grew up in San Diego.

19:07.829 --> 19:09.170
You know, being a Californian

19:09.170 --> 19:10.900
is kind of an
impromptu lifestyle

19:10.900 --> 19:12.170
when you think about it,
you know?

19:12.170 --> 19:13.869
It's very laid-back.

19:13.869 --> 19:16.500
[calming music]

19:16.500 --> 19:18.730
I love yoga.

19:18.730 --> 19:21.069
Practicing yoga is very similar
to practicing magic.

19:21.069 --> 19:23.369
The technique is very ancient,

19:23.369 --> 19:27.230
and it's just adapting
and changing certain postures

19:27.230 --> 19:31.099
or techniques
to fit a modern time.

19:31.099 --> 19:35.529

19:45.029 --> 19:47.430
- Hey, everybody.

19:47.430 --> 19:49.069
My name's Joel Ward.

19:49.069 --> 19:50.329
Let's get into the magic.

19:50.329 --> 19:51.769
Alyson, do you mind
helping out for this?

19:51.769 --> 19:53.029
Right, let's give her
a big round of applause.

19:53.029 --> 19:54.200
Alyson.
Oh, this will be fun.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.529
Can I get you over here
on this side?

19:55.529 --> 19:57.170
- Ooh, yeah, of course.
- Joel, nice to meet you.

19:57.170 --> 19:59.170
Alyson, I was wondering
if you had a ring

19:59.170 --> 20:01.029
I could borrow for this.

20:01.029 --> 20:02.269
- Sure. Just one?
- Just one ring.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.599
This is great.

20:03.599 --> 20:05.500
- Take me a while.
- Okay, this is great.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.769
All right. Here.
We're gonna try a trick here.

20:07.769 --> 20:09.099
This is gonna be a lot of fun.
Do me a favor.

20:09.099 --> 20:10.599
With your right hand,
I want you to make a fist.

20:10.599 --> 20:11.670
- Okay.
- Okay, hold it out.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.000
- Yes.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.069
- Okay, what we're gonna
try to do is we're gonna

20:14.069 --> 20:17.029
try to make this ring
disappear from this cloth,

20:17.029 --> 20:18.700
and it's gonna end up
inside that hand.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.000
- Okay.
- Okay, here. Do me a favor.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.069
I want you to pinch the ring
through the cloth.

20:22.069 --> 20:23.670
- With this--oh, duh.
- Yeah, with your left hand.

20:23.670 --> 20:25.099
Okay, you got it.
- Yeah, makes sense.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.200
- Okay, here.
It's gonna happen right there.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.670
This is gonna fool
both of you.

20:27.670 --> 20:29.569
All right, here.
On the count of three.

20:29.569 --> 20:32.670
One, two, three.

20:32.670 --> 20:34.000
- Aah!

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
[scattered laughter]

20:38.930 --> 20:39.930
- Tada!
- Open up your hand.

20:39.930 --> 20:41.000
Open up your hand.
Take a look.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.900
Uh, that would've
been good though, right?

20:42.900 --> 20:43.900
That would've been--
- It would've been.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.099
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:45.099 --> 20:46.099
That was just a quarter.
Don't worry.

20:46.099 --> 20:47.000
See, I'm palming your ring

20:47.000 --> 20:48.569
in my right hand.
- Probably, really--

20:48.569 --> 20:50.500
- See, it's right,
it's--uh-oh, that's--

20:50.500 --> 20:52.769
- Oh, that's--
- Crap, that's the quarter.

20:52.769 --> 20:55.200
- I mean, I'm sure
that's what the ring cost.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.099
- I'm so sorry.

20:56.099 --> 20:57.569
Alyson, I grew up
in the hood, right?

20:57.569 --> 21:00.900
I grew up in La Jolla,
California,

21:00.900 --> 21:03.200
which is a beach community
of San Diego.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.430
And, you know, growing up
in the hood was hard, right?

21:05.430 --> 21:06.769
- That's not--
- I was headed

21:06.769 --> 21:08.599
for a life of surfing
and carne asada burritos,

21:08.599 --> 21:10.599
and the only way out
was through sports.

21:10.599 --> 21:12.200
And as a kid, I had
to choose something.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.730
So I chose tennis,

21:14.730 --> 21:17.829
and I thought we would try
a little tennis trick.

21:17.829 --> 21:19.599
This will be a lot of fun.
Do you play tennis at all?

21:19.599 --> 21:21.170
- Not well.
- Not well, okay.

21:21.170 --> 21:22.900
All right, that's all right.
I'll tell you what.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.200
Here, we have a couple
of items here.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.430
This will be great.
Here, do me a favor.

21:27.430 --> 21:29.000
To play a little game
of tennis, how about

21:29.000 --> 21:30.670
a little headband there?
- Oh, sure. Do you want--yeah.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.170
- Here,
I'll take that quarter.

21:32.170 --> 21:33.369
I have another show tomorrow.
This will be great. Okay.

21:33.369 --> 21:34.500
- Okay. All right.
- All right. Here we go.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.029
Here, we'll get
a little headband going.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.670
- Okay.
- And let's see.

21:37.670 --> 21:38.670
Oh, yeah, looking good.

21:38.670 --> 21:39.930
- I think
that's really attractive.

21:39.930 --> 21:42.170
- This is great.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.730
Hey, let's see what else.
To play a game of tennis,

21:43.730 --> 21:45.069
we got a couple of tennis balls.

21:45.069 --> 21:47.000
Here, do me a favor, Alyson.
Just point to one.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.829
Any one you like.
Which one should we use?

21:48.829 --> 21:50.500
- Whew, I thought you were
gonna ask me to juggle.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.670
That one.
- This one here?

21:51.670 --> 21:52.730
- The round one.
- The yellow one.

21:52.730 --> 21:53.900
Nice choice, right?
- Yeah.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.500
- Good call, right?
- Thank you, yeah.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.930
- Yeah? Well, in La Jolla,
tennis balls are very rare.

21:57.930 --> 22:00.769
And as a kid, I would have
to sign my name on them,

22:00.769 --> 22:02.599
otherwise the other thugs
would steal them.

22:02.599 --> 22:03.829
- Right.
- So here, let's do this.

22:03.829 --> 22:05.599
Here, I'm gonna have you
just autograph

22:05.599 --> 22:07.000
that tennis ball
if you don't mind.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.430
- All right.
- That'd be great.

22:08.430 --> 22:10.569
Okay, cool. That has nothing
to do with the trick.

22:10.569 --> 22:12.230
I just wanted your signature.

22:12.230 --> 22:13.670
- Oops. All right, well...
- Okay, all right.

22:13.670 --> 22:15.900
This is great. How about
a little happy face, too?

22:15.900 --> 22:17.200
- Oh, sweet.
Okay.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.670
- This is a very happy,
San Diego-style trick.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.000
- Yeah. Sweet.
- Okay, cool.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.900
All right, so here we go.
Signed tennis ball.

22:21.900 --> 22:25.569
And let's see, what else do we
need to play a game of tennis?

22:25.569 --> 22:28.269
We need, of course--
- A racket?

22:28.269 --> 22:29.900
- Yeah, that's right.
A tennis net. Perfect.

22:29.900 --> 22:31.230
- Ooh. Oh.
- Okay, here, hold on to that.

22:31.230 --> 22:34.599
Okay, yeah, if you would,
just hold it up a little lower.

22:34.599 --> 22:36.400
Yeah, just up a little lower.
You're doing just great.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.029
Okay, all right.

22:38.029 --> 22:39.099
This is fun. Okay.
- That's good.

22:39.099 --> 22:40.500
- All right, Alyson,
what we're gonna do

22:40.500 --> 22:42.170
is we're gonna take your
signed tennis ball, right?

22:42.170 --> 22:44.900
We're gonna try to ricochet it
off the back of the theater.

22:44.900 --> 22:47.829
It's gonna land right there
inside the net.

22:47.829 --> 22:49.170
- That's a good idea.
- I got this. I got this.

22:49.170 --> 22:50.069
- Really good.
- All right.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.569
Can I get a little
tennis hitting music?

22:51.569 --> 22:52.730
- Oh. Look, you've got
some audience members.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.069
- Perfect.

22:54.069 --> 22:57.069
[rock music plays]

22:57.069 --> 22:59.069
â™ª â™ª

22:59.069 --> 23:00.170
- All right,
up a little higher.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.329
This is good.

23:02.329 --> 23:07.230
â™ª â™ª

23:07.230 --> 23:10.329
[applause]

23:10.329 --> 23:12.700
All right, that was a bust.
I think I know what happened.

23:12.700 --> 23:15.900
Sometimes tennis balls deflate,
you know?

23:15.900 --> 23:17.569
Like footballs, in the NFL.

23:17.569 --> 23:19.700
You know how they sometimes
deflate right here?

23:19.700 --> 23:20.930
Why don't you take that off?

23:20.930 --> 23:22.069
- Thank you.
- Here, I'll take that back.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.069
Here, look.
I have a brand-new tube

23:23.069 --> 23:24.500
of tennis balls in here.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.599
Why don't we just
try this trick one more time?

23:26.599 --> 23:27.869
Here, do me a favor.

23:27.869 --> 23:29.930
Can I get you to examine
that can there,

23:29.930 --> 23:31.170
and really check it out, right?

23:31.170 --> 23:33.029
Make sure it's just
a regular can of tennis balls.

23:33.029 --> 23:34.069
- Yeah.
- And you see the top

23:34.069 --> 23:35.230
there where it's sealed?
- Yes.

23:35.230 --> 23:36.730
- Can I get you
to pop that open?

23:36.730 --> 23:37.900
I always hate this part.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.069
I always have
my tennis partner do this.

23:39.069 --> 23:41.069
- Okay.
- And here, I'll take the lid.

23:41.069 --> 23:42.099
Okay, this is great.

23:42.099 --> 23:43.930
And if you would, go ahead,
smell them, right?

23:43.930 --> 23:45.329
Smell my...

23:45.329 --> 23:46.599
- Oh...
- Smell them.

23:46.599 --> 23:49.230
Okay, they're brand-new.
Okay, this is good.

23:49.230 --> 23:51.170
Here, pour them
into the net there.

23:51.170 --> 23:52.869
Oh, look at that.
Three balls in the net.

23:52.869 --> 23:55.069
Let's see.
There's one signed ball.

23:55.069 --> 23:56.369
Is that your signature?
- What?

23:56.369 --> 23:57.529
Yes, it is.
- Check it out.

23:57.529 --> 23:58.730
Let's give her
a big round of applause.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.099
That's pretty cool.
[applause]

24:01.099 --> 24:03.069
- That's amazing.
- What? Magic.

24:03.069 --> 24:05.230
- What?

24:05.230 --> 24:07.200
- All right, that's awesome.
All right, that's for you.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.069
Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

24:08.069 --> 24:11.670
- Oh, we're forgetting
something.

24:11.670 --> 24:12.769
Let's try this.

24:12.769 --> 24:14.500
Uh...

24:14.500 --> 24:16.170
[tennis ball rattles]

24:16.170 --> 24:18.029
No way.
Could it be?

24:18.029 --> 24:20.000
Maybe, probably.
That's my job, right?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.529
There's--do you hear
that loose?

24:22.529 --> 24:24.200
- I do hear something.
- There is something in there.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.769
- That's--yeah.
- Yeah, that would be good.

24:25.769 --> 24:27.329
Here, let's try this.
Here, hold on to this.

24:27.329 --> 24:29.430
Okay, I was online
the other day,

24:29.430 --> 24:32.099
and I picked up this.

24:32.099 --> 24:35.599
They said it was
O.J. Simpson's, right?

24:35.599 --> 24:37.529
This is just
a cut-resistant glove, actually.

24:37.529 --> 24:38.529
- Okay.
- It's for cooking,

24:38.529 --> 24:40.069
so you don't cut your hand.

24:40.069 --> 24:41.000
Is there any hidden compartments

24:41.000 --> 24:42.170
in there?
- No.

24:42.170 --> 24:43.329
- Any spots
to place rings or anything?

24:43.329 --> 24:45.029
It's just a chainmail glove?

24:45.029 --> 24:46.099
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

24:46.099 --> 24:49.200
We also have this.
Now, here.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.200
Are you left-handed
or right-handed, Alyson?

24:50.200 --> 24:51.400
- Uh...right.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.400
- Right-handed?
- Yeah.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.400
- Just place
your right hand right there.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.400
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.400
Just the fingerprints are great.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.170
Thank you so much.
All right.

24:57.170 --> 24:59.500
[laughter]

24:59.500 --> 25:01.829
No, I'm kidding.
Okay, no.

25:01.829 --> 25:05.029
No, here.
Let's go inside that ball there.

25:05.029 --> 25:07.900
There is something inside.
Here, let's do this.

25:07.900 --> 25:12.029
Here, we'll just slice
right inside.

25:12.029 --> 25:15.069
Hold out your hand.
- Ah, that's my ring.

25:15.069 --> 25:16.269
- Is that your ring?
- Yes.

25:16.269 --> 25:18.170
- Check it out. Let's give her
a big round of applause.

25:18.170 --> 25:20.500
[cheers and applause]
- Yes!

25:20.500 --> 25:22.000
Wow.
- And that is for you.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.769
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Joel Ward!

25:26.769 --> 25:30.329
Wow.
It still fits.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.700
- All right.
- That's incredible.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.900
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.930
Do you do any more tricks
with your balls?

25:35.930 --> 25:37.069
- All right.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.329
- I meant sports. Sports.
- Yeah, sports.

25:38.329 --> 25:39.730
- That's what I meant.
- Right, yeah, sports.

25:39.730 --> 25:42.829
- And some people say you look
like somebody I know.

25:42.829 --> 25:44.069
- Oh, yeah. That's right.
This is like an episode

25:44.069 --> 25:45.170
of "How I Met Your Mother,"
right?

25:45.170 --> 25:48.369
This is Lily,
Barney, Barney, Lily.

25:48.369 --> 25:50.269
Okay. Yeah, no,
I get that a lot, right?

25:50.269 --> 25:51.369
- Oh, all right.

25:51.369 --> 25:52.569
Penn, Teller,

25:52.569 --> 25:55.200
what do you think
of our trickster?

25:55.200 --> 25:58.099
- He absolutely wins
best costume ever on "Fool Us."

25:58.099 --> 26:00.269
- Yeah, definitely.

26:00.269 --> 26:02.900
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

26:02.900 --> 26:06.000
- Very few,
very few other magicians

26:06.000 --> 26:08.200
would show their legs, sir.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.400
And you're there,
you're full La Jolla.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.529
You know, it's always nice

26:13.529 --> 26:17.230
when you have a big bag
onstage you can reach into.

26:17.230 --> 26:19.200
That covers a multitude of sins.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.400
- Sure does.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.069
[laughter]

26:22.069 --> 26:25.869
- What you have here
is a couple of wonderful things.

26:25.869 --> 26:27.230
You have a
wonderful presentation--

26:27.230 --> 26:30.400
the bill in the lemon
is essentially what that is.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.700
- Yes.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.069
- But a ring is better,

26:33.069 --> 26:35.200
because a ring, you don't have
to have signed or anything.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.529
We all know the way to vanish
a ring in a handkerchief,

26:38.529 --> 26:40.099
and having the thing,

26:40.099 --> 26:42.069
when we were all ready
for something else,

26:42.069 --> 26:44.670
for that thing to just
skitter across the stage

26:44.670 --> 26:45.670
where we could see it,

26:45.670 --> 26:47.200
really funny, really good.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.099
- Thank you very much.
- Works kind of the same way.

26:49.099 --> 26:50.930
It's just smarter, and better,

26:50.930 --> 26:54.369
and more deceptive
to everybody but us.

26:54.369 --> 26:55.930
[laughter]

26:55.930 --> 26:58.029
And so I think
we've covered it.

26:58.029 --> 26:59.200
We can give you more,

26:59.200 --> 27:01.170
but we'd like
to just praise you

27:01.170 --> 27:02.500
and say that you didn't fool us.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.000
- Thank you very much.
I appreciate that, right.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.230
- Wonderful.
- Thank you guys, right.

27:05.230 --> 27:06.369
- So you didn't fool them,
but you won best costume.

27:06.369 --> 27:07.500
- Yes.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.829
- So that's pretty awesome,
right?

27:08.829 --> 27:10.000
- That'll work. Great.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.369
Joel Ward!
- Thank you, Penn and Teller.

27:11.369 --> 27:14.000
All right, thank you, Alyson.
All right, thank you guys.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.500
[cheers and applause]

27:15.500 --> 27:20.029
- Well, Penn and Teller have
been totally unstumpable so far.

27:20.029 --> 27:23.000
Let's see if they can keep it up
when we return.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000

27:32.930 --> 27:35.930
[jazz music]

27:35.930 --> 27:38.500
[cheers and applause]

27:38.500 --> 27:40.769
- Welcome back to Las Vegas,

27:40.769 --> 27:42.569
where the heat
is on our magicians

27:42.569 --> 27:44.670
who are trying to fool
Penn and Teller.

27:44.670 --> 27:46.400
Let's see who's next.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.500
- I'm Mahdi Gilbert,
and magic is my life.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.329
I was born without
any hands or feet.

27:55.329 --> 27:56.869
But when I was a kid,

27:56.869 --> 27:59.269
I absolutely believed
that if I became a magician,

27:59.269 --> 28:01.069
that I would be able
to do anything.

28:01.069 --> 28:04.069
But every single book
that's ever been written

28:04.069 --> 28:06.700
is for magicians
who have two hands.

28:06.700 --> 28:10.000
All the techniques that I do
are of my own invention.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.700
I've created every single
technique that I can use.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.529
There's nothing
that's been given to me.

28:14.529 --> 28:18.099
I was able to transform
my own life.

28:18.099 --> 28:20.400
I think learning
how to do this stuff

28:20.400 --> 28:23.730
that everybody in the world
thought was impossible,

28:23.730 --> 28:25.869
that to me is real magic.

28:25.869 --> 28:28.000
I don't feel like I was born
missing anything.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.500
I feel I am the way
that I am supposed to be,

28:31.500 --> 28:33.900
and my magic is real.

28:33.900 --> 28:36.900
[cheers and applause]

28:39.029 --> 28:43.269
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the amazing Mahdi Gilbert.

28:43.269 --> 28:48.099
[cheers and applause]

28:48.099 --> 28:49.170
- Thank you.

28:49.170 --> 28:50.869
It's an honor to be here.

28:50.869 --> 28:52.000
And my name is Mahdi,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.869
and tonight, I'm gonna try
to make your world

28:54.869 --> 28:56.430
a little bit more magical.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.829
But I need a little help
from my new friends.

28:58.829 --> 29:00.329
So, Alyson, would you
please join me?

29:00.329 --> 29:04.000
And, Penn and Teller, you guys
can come and take a seat too.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.069
Have a closer look
at all this stuff.

29:08.069 --> 29:11.500
Now, before we begin,
I want to tell you

29:11.500 --> 29:13.869
a little something about myself.

29:13.869 --> 29:16.730
It's very special for me
to be here tonight

29:16.730 --> 29:19.200
because I'm onstage

29:19.200 --> 29:21.430
with two of the greatest
magicians of all time.

29:21.430 --> 29:23.269
And the only reason
that I'm here

29:23.269 --> 29:25.730
is because I absolutely
believe in magic.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.569
And I'm not afraid
to believe in the impossible.

29:28.569 --> 29:30.329
I've been interested
in doing magic

29:30.329 --> 29:32.099
for a very long time,

29:32.099 --> 29:33.269
but it's always been
out of reach.

29:33.269 --> 29:34.529
I don't mean
that figuratively.

29:34.529 --> 29:36.170
I mean, can you pass
that deck over?

29:36.170 --> 29:39.900
I can't reach it.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.529
And what I'd like
to show you guys tonight

29:41.529 --> 29:43.900
is my favorite piece,
and it's a piece

29:43.900 --> 29:46.730
that I've been doing
for a very long time.

29:46.730 --> 29:51.099
It uses six cards
and two hands.

29:51.099 --> 29:55.000
Three red and three black.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.170
Nothing else.
Okay?

29:58.170 --> 30:00.000
I'll do it like this
for you guys.

30:03.730 --> 30:07.700
Here.
I'll put a red card over here,

30:07.700 --> 30:09.769
followed by a black.

30:12.599 --> 30:15.730
A red...

30:15.730 --> 30:18.170
followed by a black.

30:18.170 --> 30:20.170
Red and black.

30:20.170 --> 30:22.569
And I said this trick
needs two hands.

30:22.569 --> 30:24.200
I need a little bit
of help to do this.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.029
Can I borrow
your hands, Alyson?

30:26.029 --> 30:27.069
- Sure.

30:27.069 --> 30:29.900
- Can you interlace
your fingers?

30:29.900 --> 30:33.000
Just like this, and this is
the position of the cards.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.329
This is a red and a black,

30:35.329 --> 30:37.569
a red and a black,
a red and a black.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.200
That's the position
of the cards.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.900
And if you could
separate your hands,

30:40.900 --> 30:43.200
separating the red cards
from the black,

30:43.200 --> 30:46.029
putting one on top of the other.

30:46.029 --> 30:48.069
And because you do that
over there,

30:48.069 --> 30:51.700
something happens over here.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.099
It's hard to believe.

30:53.099 --> 30:54.269
I don't do anything,

30:54.269 --> 30:57.930
but all the black cards
have come together,

30:57.930 --> 31:00.769
and all the red cards
have come together.

31:00.769 --> 31:03.769
[cheers and applause]

31:06.000 --> 31:07.099
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.670
You didn't get to see
all the cards,

31:08.670 --> 31:10.569
because there's cards face up,

31:10.569 --> 31:12.099
and there's cards face down.

31:12.099 --> 31:16.329
So I'll do it so that
you can see very clearly.

31:16.329 --> 31:19.599
Like this, here and here.

31:19.599 --> 31:21.369
Everybody can see
that they're mixed,

31:21.369 --> 31:23.569
red, black, red, black,
red, black.

31:23.569 --> 31:26.099
Black, red, black over here.

31:26.099 --> 31:28.170
Red, black, red over here.

31:28.170 --> 31:31.769
Two piles...

31:31.769 --> 31:33.769
here and over here.

31:33.769 --> 31:35.400
And I'll show this
to the camera again,

31:35.400 --> 31:40.730
so there's absolutely no doubt
as to where the cards are.

31:40.730 --> 31:43.170
Black, red, black here.

31:43.170 --> 31:45.599
Red, black, red over here.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.670
Now, everybody,
for this to work,

31:47.670 --> 31:49.329
I need everybody to help me.

31:49.329 --> 31:52.200
So, Alyson, can you
interlace your fingers?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.430
And, Penn and Teller, can you
interlace your fingers?

31:54.430 --> 31:55.769
And everybody in the audience,

31:55.769 --> 31:57.930
basically if you have hands,
interlace your fingers.

31:57.930 --> 32:00.269
[laughter]

32:00.269 --> 32:01.599
Interlace them.

32:01.599 --> 32:04.069
Everybody has them interlaced?

32:04.069 --> 32:06.200
Pull them apart,
the reds from the blacks.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.599
Separate them.

32:07.599 --> 32:10.200
Put one on top of the other.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.200
Now, I don't know
if you guys believe in magic,

32:12.200 --> 32:13.599
but I do.

32:13.599 --> 32:17.170
And because I do...

32:17.170 --> 32:20.069
this should be
all the black cards together.

32:20.069 --> 32:22.200
All the black cards together.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.029
And over here,
all of the red cards.

32:25.029 --> 32:28.029
[cheers and applause]

32:30.069 --> 32:32.430
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

32:32.430 --> 32:34.029
[applause]

32:34.029 --> 32:37.869
- Mahdi, that was incredible.
Magic is real.

32:37.869 --> 32:39.599
And I knew it.
Ha!

32:39.599 --> 32:41.069
- So did I.
- Yeah.

32:41.069 --> 32:44.430
And I love that you didn't
let anything stop you.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.029
- No.
- And I'm sure

32:46.029 --> 32:47.700
people told you
you couldn't do it.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.000
- Oh, yeah.
My whole life.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.170
- And you were like,
"Pshh! I'll show you."

32:51.170 --> 32:52.930
- When I started
to tackle card magic,

32:52.930 --> 32:54.029
I couldn't do anything.

32:54.029 --> 32:55.230
I couldn't pick up
a deck of cards.

32:55.230 --> 32:57.099
I couldn't shuffle.
I couldn't do anything.

32:57.099 --> 32:59.069
So I would stay up all night

32:59.069 --> 33:01.500
reading all the books,
trying to figure out techniques.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.500
And all the stuff
that I do is based

33:03.500 --> 33:06.029
on classical techniques
that already exist,

33:06.029 --> 33:10.029
but my versions of it
are completely new

33:10.029 --> 33:11.200
and original with me.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.569
So nobody knows how they work.

33:12.569 --> 33:14.170
I'm the one
who's created them.

33:14.170 --> 33:15.170
- Yeah.
And where's, like,

33:15.170 --> 33:17.869
the weirdest place
you sort of get an idea?

33:17.869 --> 33:19.829
Like, are you ever
on a date and you're like,

33:19.829 --> 33:20.829
"I've got to go"?

33:20.829 --> 33:22.869
- I never leave dates
for magic.

33:22.869 --> 33:24.329
- Okay, really?

33:24.329 --> 33:26.599
Okay.
All right.

33:26.599 --> 33:28.170
That's probably smart.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.029
[applause]

33:30.029 --> 33:32.170
Well, you are
such an inspiration.

33:32.170 --> 33:34.730
Let's go to the guys.
Gentlemen?

33:34.730 --> 33:37.000
- Wow.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.230
- We believe...

33:38.230 --> 33:41.230
[cheers and applause]

33:44.269 --> 33:47.569
I don't say this lightly...

33:47.569 --> 33:49.230
but I believe you're cheating.

33:49.230 --> 33:51.170
[laughter]

33:51.170 --> 33:54.000
Because one of the things

33:54.000 --> 33:55.769
we're doing on this show

33:55.769 --> 33:58.369
is we read a lot of magic books,

33:58.369 --> 34:01.029
and study a lot of magicians,

34:01.029 --> 34:03.269
and watch a lot of videos.

34:03.269 --> 34:06.329
And every single thing
we watch and study

34:06.329 --> 34:08.099
is for people with hands.

34:08.099 --> 34:09.369
- Yeah.

34:09.369 --> 34:11.400
- You don't have hands.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.599
It's all different methods.
You're cheating.

34:13.599 --> 34:16.199
That's all I'm saying.

34:16.199 --> 34:19.030
That having been said,
so, so beautiful.

34:19.030 --> 34:20.329
It's just so beautiful.

34:20.329 --> 34:22.030
The kind of trick
you're doing just--

34:22.030 --> 34:23.699
this doesn't--
this doesn't give it away.

34:23.699 --> 34:25.369
But it's called
an oil and water trick.

34:25.369 --> 34:26.900
- Yes.
- And there are many,

34:26.900 --> 34:28.329
many ways to do it.

34:28.329 --> 34:30.929
And we're just going
to take a shot.

34:30.929 --> 34:33.099
We're aware
we could be wrong, okay?

34:33.099 --> 34:36.400
'Cause we didn't see anything
that looked bad.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.099
Everything looked clean
and neat.

34:39.099 --> 34:41.929
But I think
that if we're right,

34:41.929 --> 34:44.929
we would say that
for guys with hands,

34:44.929 --> 34:48.570
things that are really smooth
for us

34:48.570 --> 34:50.730
might be kind of rough for you,

34:50.730 --> 34:52.570
as you were learning
to put this together.

34:52.570 --> 34:54.329
As you're putting it together,
was that any sort of--

34:54.329 --> 34:56.730
does that mean anything to you?
- No. No.

34:56.730 --> 34:58.900
- But what's that mean?
That means something good.

34:58.900 --> 35:01.000
- If that doesn't mean--
if the word "rough"

35:01.000 --> 35:03.369
and the word "smooth"
mean nothing to you,

35:03.369 --> 35:05.869
then maybe this sentence
will mean something to you.

35:05.869 --> 35:09.070
You fooled us.

35:09.070 --> 35:12.030
Does that mean something to you?
- Whoo!

35:12.030 --> 35:14.099
That's so awesome!

35:14.099 --> 35:16.769
Oh, that is awesome!

35:16.769 --> 35:18.070
- Thank you.

35:18.070 --> 35:19.530
[cheers and applause]

35:19.530 --> 35:21.329
- And there it is!

35:21.329 --> 35:24.599
[cheers and applause]

35:24.599 --> 35:28.699
- How exciting!
Oh, my gosh!

35:28.699 --> 35:32.099
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mahdi Gilbert!

35:32.099 --> 35:33.530
Thank you!
- Thank you very much.

35:33.530 --> 35:36.670
- All right.

35:36.670 --> 35:39.369
Wow.

35:39.369 --> 35:41.199
Don't go away,
because, when we come back,

35:41.199 --> 35:44.070
the great Penn and Teller
will perform.

35:56.869 --> 36:00.699
[cheers and applause]

36:00.699 --> 36:03.199
- Now, let's finish
with a bang.

36:03.199 --> 36:06.030
Here's a trick
from the most magical pairing

36:06.030 --> 36:08.329
since peanut butter and Jell-O.

36:08.329 --> 36:11.030
That's right.
Don't knock it till you try it.

36:11.030 --> 36:13.730
Here's Penn and Teller.

36:13.730 --> 36:14.730
- Go!

36:14.730 --> 36:16.170
[upbeat music]

36:16.170 --> 36:18.170
Here's your chance
to be in our position.

36:18.170 --> 36:20.929
Try to figure this out.
Watch carefully.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.829
Don't be confused
by the dancing.

36:22.829 --> 36:24.829
Don't be confused by the music.

36:24.829 --> 36:26.769
Don't be confused by the props.

36:26.769 --> 36:30.030
Just watch it, and see if you
can figure out how it's done,
