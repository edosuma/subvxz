to anyone.

35:02.202 --> 35:06.110
Go ahead, throw it in the fire.

35:06.110 --> 35:08.749
Forget all this ever happened.

35:08.749 --> 35:11.755
Tomorrow you can borrow my car
and get away from this place.

35:11.755 --> 35:14.093
Find yourself a new life.

35:23.144 --> 35:24.781
I'm going to bed.

35:25.883 --> 35:27.720
Love you, kiddo.

35:39.611 --> 35:41.347
Hey, anyone!

35:41.347 --> 35:43.217
We got a situation here!

35:43.217 --> 35:45.488
You two, grab your guns,
you're coming with me.

35:45.488 --> 35:48.696
Logan's little toy just escaped
from its cage.

35:48.696 --> 35:49.798
Give me that.

35:49.798 --> 35:51.467
Grab your own.

35:52.402 --> 35:54.574
Let's go monster hunting.

36:01.187 --> 36:01.888
Ugh.

36:01.888 --> 36:03.358
Dang.

36:09.771 --> 36:10.806
[growling]

36:10.806 --> 36:12.275
There he is!

36:12.275 --> 36:16.350
[gunfire]

36:17.653 --> 36:19.624

36:20.726 --> 36:21.928
Rhodes: Where is he?

36:25.368 --> 36:27.507
[gun clatters]

36:30.478 --> 36:32.482
Oh man, this isn't good.

36:32.482 --> 36:35.623
You... you need to find him,
okay, because he's after me!

36:35.623 --> 36:37.660
Just... just go!

36:41.835 --> 36:43.872
[gunfire]

36:43.872 --> 36:45.676
[distant screams]

36:45.676 --> 36:46.712
Oh shit.

36:46.712 --> 36:48.247
[distant screams]

36:48.247 --> 36:48.916
Come on.

36:50.418 --> 36:52.690
[whimpering]
Oh shit.

36:57.567 --> 37:00.573
[growling]

37:37.947 --> 37:40.351
Are you sure about this?
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.667
Is there really enough time
for this?

37:47.667 --> 37:48.869
Love is what makes
life worth living.

37:48.869 --> 37:50.004
Stop.

37:50.004 --> 37:51.875
Forget I asked.

37:51.875 --> 37:57.720
I know this isn't the day
you envisioned.

37:57.720 --> 38:04.066
[teary]
Trey and I were married
for 23 years.

38:04.066 --> 38:04.868
Sorry.

38:06.972 --> 38:11.080
And if there is one thing that
I've learned about marriage,

38:11.080 --> 38:15.923
it's that things will never turn
out the way you think they will.

38:15.923 --> 38:19.564
So in some ways, this is
actually the perfect day

38:19.564 --> 38:21.735
for you to start
your journey together.

38:23.037 --> 38:28.582
When this day began you
were two separate people

38:28.582 --> 38:31.353
living two separate lives.

38:33.792 --> 38:37.900
This morning you had no idea
what today would bring.

38:40.338 --> 38:41.675
Life is like that.

38:43.912 --> 38:49.624
We have no control over
what comes with each dawn.

38:49.624 --> 38:51.761
[engine starts]

38:51.761 --> 38:57.005
Every sunrise brings with it
a new mystery.

38:58.675 --> 39:00.713
We lie to ourselves,

39:00.713 --> 39:06.056
thinking we know
how it'll all turn out.

39:06.056 --> 39:07.560
But things change.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.096
[splash]

39:10.064 --> 39:12.402
Fate intervenes.

39:15.976 --> 39:18.749
But what you two have chosen
to do today...

39:18.749 --> 39:20.418
[rumbling]

39:20.418 --> 39:21.821
means you will never

39:21.821 --> 39:24.928
have to go through those things
alone again.

39:24.928 --> 39:26.463
That's marriage.

39:26.463 --> 39:31.575
It is making a commitment to
face the challenges of each day

39:31.575 --> 39:33.946
head on together.

39:35.549 --> 39:36.518
What the hell?

39:36.518 --> 39:40.391
[alarm beeping]

39:40.926 --> 39:43.999
No matter what surprises
today throws at you...

39:43.999 --> 39:47.138
Hey Dad, I'm leaving!

39:47.138 --> 39:48.174
For work!

39:48.875 --> 39:54.988
At least you know...
you're not alone.

39:55.623 --> 39:59.564
Now, you go and you love
each other as hard as you can

39:59.564 --> 40:02.570
for as long as you can.

40:02.570 --> 40:06.110
You don't let anything
come between you.

40:06.745 --> 40:10.786
Do you think you can
do that?

40:10.786 --> 40:12.657
Yeah.

40:12.657 --> 40:13.725
I do.

40:13.725 --> 40:15.028
I do, too.

40:16.430 --> 40:19.671
Then by the power vested in me
by the State of Pennsylvania,

40:19.671 --> 40:23.712
I now pronounce you,
husband and wife.

40:27.820 --> 40:31.861

40:33.598 --> 40:35.134
Thank you.

40:35.134 --> 40:36.938
Congratulations.

40:52.937 --> 40:54.807
Are you kidding me?

40:54.807 --> 40:55.475
Luke?

40:55.475 --> 40:58.014
Yeah, what a load of horse shit.

40:58.014 --> 40:59.684
Love as hard as you can?

40:59.684 --> 41:01.755
You are such a hypocrite.
Your marriage was a joke!

41:01.755 --> 41:02.556
You keep your voice down.

41:02.556 --> 41:04.259
Why? Why?

41:04.259 --> 41:05.562
Are you afraid everybody
in this town

41:05.562 --> 41:07.733
is gonna finally realize
how full of shit you are?

41:07.733 --> 41:08.568
I loved your father!

41:08.568 --> 41:09.971
What? How?

41:09.971 --> 41:15.683
By cutting him down literally
every time he opened his mouth?

41:15.683 --> 41:17.152
You know, I'm glad
he was screwing Nicole.

41:17.152 --> 41:19.590
God, at least she frickin'
liked him.

41:20.158 --> 41:21.828
What are you talking about?

41:21.828 --> 41:23.565
Oh, my god, you didn't even
know, did you?

41:23.565 --> 41:26.103
No. No, of course
you didn't know.

41:26.103 --> 41:27.272
God, you're so worried

41:27.272 --> 41:28.842
about what everybody in this
damn town thinks about you,

41:28.842 --> 41:29.811
you don't even know
what's going on

41:29.811 --> 41:31.981
in your own fucking family!

41:31.981 --> 41:33.885
That is not true!

41:33.885 --> 41:37.258
Dad died trying to prove to you
that he was good enough.

41:37.258 --> 41:38.795
And he wasn't, was he?

41:38.795 --> 41:40.264
No one is.
Not him, not me‐

41:40.264 --> 41:41.868
Look, that is enough!

41:43.070 --> 41:44.206
I can't even breathe around you
without feeling like a failure.

41:44.206 --> 41:49.149
I wish for just one second
I wasn't letting you down.

41:49.149 --> 41:51.888
Like I could actually be
who I am around you!

41:51.888 --> 41:52.590
Fine!

41:52.590 --> 41:54.159
Luke, who are you?

41:54.159 --> 41:56.196
Who is it that I'm not letting
you be?

41:56.196 --> 41:58.835
Gay, mom!

41:58.835 --> 41:59.871
I'm gay.

42:03.077 --> 42:05.849
And the one parent I actually
wanted to tell is dead

42:05.849 --> 42:08.722
in a dumpster.

42:08.722 --> 42:11.628
And I'm stuck here
with this raving bitch
