00:00.471 --> 00:03.134
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.134 --> 00:04.775
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.777
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:06.777 --> 00:10.041
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.512
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.246
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.246 --> 00:16.587
MAYBE YOUR NEW FINANCIAL ADVISOR
CAN HELP YOU

00:16.587 --> 00:17.788
FIND YOUR WAY OUT
OF THE RED.

00:17.788 --> 00:19.350
SURELY, AIDEN,
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW

00:19.350 --> 00:21.622
THE GRAYSONS
ARE COMPLETELY BANKRUPT.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.024
TOGETHER WE'RE GOING
TO DESTROY THAT LITTLE BITCH.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.197
VICTORIA TOOK THE BAIT.
 THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.

00:26.197 --> 00:27.728
WELL, I KNEW THAT
IF YOU REACHED OUT TO ME,

00:27.728 --> 00:29.630
I MUST BE THE ONLY ONE
YOU COULD TURN TO.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.661
MY MOTHER WARNED ME
NOT TO TRUST YOU.

00:30.661 --> 00:32.162
YET HERE YOU ARE.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.165
WELL, I LIKE TO DRAW
MY OWN CONCLUSIONS.

00:34.165 --> 00:35.266
(lowered voice)
AMANDA CLARKE WAS MY FRIEND.

00:35.266 --> 00:37.438
SHE KNEW WHAT CONRAD DID
TO HER FATHER.

00:37.438 --> 00:40.111
I WANT YOU TO PERSUADE HIM
TO CONFESS.

00:40.111 --> 00:42.343
I'M TURNING MYSELF IN
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.176
IF YOU GET IN THAT CAR, I SWEAR
IT'LL BE THE LAST THING YOU DO!

00:45.176 --> 00:47.278
(crackling)
 FATHER PAUL!

00:47.278 --> 00:49.150
EMILY.

00:50.181 --> 00:51.382
(siren wailing)

00:51.382 --> 00:53.624
(wheels clacking)

00:53.624 --> 00:55.256
(man) CONRAD GRAYSON
INVOLVED IN M.V.A.,

00:55.256 --> 00:57.758
BLOOD PRESSURE--170/100,
PULSE--120,

00:57.758 --> 01:00.060
POSSIBLE HEAD TRAUMA.
C.T. SCAN RECOMMENDED.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.493
PAUL WHITLEY B.P.--
40 OVER PALP,

01:02.493 --> 01:03.664
POSSIBLE SPINAL INJURY,

01:03.664 --> 01:06.267
SIGNIFICANT BLOOD LOST
AT SCENE.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.268
PLEASE HOLD ON.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.639
YOU NEED TO WAIT HERE.

01:08.639 --> 01:10.471
(woman speaking indistinctly
 over P.A.)

01:10.471 --> 01:12.273
(breathing heavily)

01:20.080 --> 01:22.483
(footsteps approach)

01:22.483 --> 01:24.115
VICTORIA, YOU'RE CRYING.

01:24.115 --> 01:27.188
"ADAM AND EVE
BANISHED FROM EDEN."

01:27.188 --> 01:29.420
IT'S MY FIRST RANDOLPH.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.592
(chuckles) IT'S PROPHETIC,

01:31.592 --> 01:34.725
AS CONRAD WAS
THE SERPENT ALL ALONG,

01:34.725 --> 01:36.096
DRAGGING ME TO HELL
WITH HIM.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.299
NOW HE'S GOING TO DO
SOMETHING

01:38.299 --> 01:42.273
TO DESTROY ME
AND THIS ENTIRE FAMILY.

01:42.273 --> 01:45.336
LOSING OUR FORTUNE
PROVED INSUFFICIENT.

01:45.336 --> 01:46.837
NOW HE'S GOING TO DIE
AND LEAVE ME

01:46.837 --> 01:50.141
WITH THE SHAME OF HIS SINS.
GOD... HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL.

01:50.141 --> 01:51.682
YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE--
YOU'RE BOUND TO CONRAD

01:51.682 --> 01:53.113
WITH NO WAY OUT.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.416
YOU ARE VICKY HARPER--

01:55.416 --> 01:57.688
THE WOMAN WHO MADE
AN ENVIABLE LIFE FROM NOTHING.

01:57.688 --> 01:59.250
THAT'S WHO I WAS ONCE.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.892
THAT'S WHO YOU ARE NOW.

02:01.892 --> 02:04.395
AND I KNOW THAT...

02:04.395 --> 02:06.227
(inhales deeply)

02:06.227 --> 02:08.598
BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE THE SAME.

02:08.598 --> 02:11.162
NOW YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED

02:11.162 --> 02:15.736
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE
RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.369
SELL THIS COLLECTION.

02:18.369 --> 02:20.571
AND WE'LL LEAVE
THE HAMPTONS.

02:20.571 --> 02:22.873
OH...

02:22.873 --> 02:27.448
I HAVE TRIED TO LEAVE HIM
SO MANY TIMES.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.480
BUT I CAN'T ABANDON
CHARLOTTE AND DANIEL

02:29.480 --> 02:32.183
TO DEAL WITH CONRAD'S MESS.

02:32.183 --> 02:34.255
MY CHILDREN NEED ME
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.387
(footsteps approach)
 (Bianca) MRS. GRAYSON?

02:37.588 --> 02:38.889
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT.

02:41.192 --> 02:44.195

02:49.169 --> 02:50.541
HEY.

YOU GET A CHANCE TO LOOK OVER
MY REMODEL IDEAS, J.P.?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.707
(huffs)
 SUCCESS IS ALL ABOUT
BRANDING.

02:56.707 --> 02:59.910
WELL, BRANDING CAN KEEP
CALLING ME "JACK."

02:59.910 --> 03:03.954
BUT I DID CHECK 'EM OUT,
AND I'M DOWN FOR A FEW CHANGES.

03:05.516 --> 03:06.687

INVITATIONS TO

03:08.819 --> 03:10.791
MAID OF HONOR
REPORTING FOR DUTY.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.223
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
INTO IT.

03:12.223 --> 03:15.466
EMILY AND I HAVE HIT
A FEW BUMPS LATELY.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.298
I'M TRYING THE BYGONES THING

03:17.298 --> 03:18.699
BECAUSE SHE'S MARRYING
MY BROTHER IN EIGHT WEEKS.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.232
BUT SOMETIMES, I SWEAR,
I DON'T KNOW THE REAL EMILY.

03:21.232 --> 03:23.234
MM.

03:23.234 --> 03:27.207
SO ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKING
MARGAUX TO THE WEDDING?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.509

03:28.509 --> 03:30.210
I'M NOT GOING

NOT GOING?

03:31.482 --> 03:33.344
(sighs)

03:33.344 --> 03:36.947
I NEED A LITTLE BREAK
FROM EMILY THORNE.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.993

04:08.979 --> 04:11.021
I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH
OF ANYTHING OUT HERE.

04:11.021 --> 04:12.853
UM...

04:12.853 --> 04:14.425
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

04:14.425 --> 04:16.427
(sighs) FATHER PAUL'S GONE.

04:16.427 --> 04:20.531
HE WENT INTO
CARDIAC ARREST...

04:20.531 --> 04:22.533
AND THEY COULDN'T
SAVE HIM.

04:25.035 --> 04:26.697
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

04:26.697 --> 04:29.970
YEAH, HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.344
HE WAS TAKEN TOO SOON.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.876
YOU KNOW, VICTORIA DIDN'T
SAY MUCH ABOUT HIM

04:35.876 --> 04:38.649
ON THE DRIVE OVER HERE...

04:38.649 --> 04:41.011
OR ABOUT CONRAD,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.

04:41.011 --> 04:44.685
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?
 NO.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.917
DANIEL MADE IT CLEAR
I WASN'T NEEDED IN THE ROOM.

04:46.917 --> 04:50.921
HE... SAID IT WAS
FAMILY ONLY.

04:50.921 --> 04:53.023
AH. (chuckles)
 I KNOW WHEN
I'M NOT WELCOME.

04:53.023 --> 04:56.597
THE GRAYSONS TEND TO CLOSE RANKS
IN MOMENTS LIKE THESE.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.501
JUST TELL MY MOTHER
I'LL BE AT THE MANOR

05:00.501 --> 05:02.002
IF SHE NEEDS ME.

05:06.477 --> 05:09.009
JUST PLEASE,
TRY CHARLOTTE AGAIN.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.781
SHE MUST NOT HAVE
GOT MY MESSAGES,

05:10.781 --> 05:12.383
AS I'M SURE
SHE WOULD BE HERE.

05:12.383 --> 05:15.646
STILL, I'D RATHER SHE NOT
LEARN ABOUT MY ACCIDENT ON...

05:15.646 --> 05:16.987
TWITTER.

05:16.987 --> 05:19.590
OH, AND YET YOU WERE
SO EAGER TO AIR YOUR CONFESSION

05:19.590 --> 05:21.952
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO HEAR
ON THE EVENING NEWS.

05:21.952 --> 05:24.054
IT SEEMS THAT
YOUR FATHER'S DYING WISH

05:24.054 --> 05:26.326
IS TO PUT A FINAL NAIL
IN THE FAMILY COFFIN

05:26.326 --> 05:28.959
BY PUBLICLY ADMITTING
TO FRAMING DAVID CLARKE.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.431
THAT'S WHERE HE WAS HEADED.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.962
WHY ON EARTH WOULD
YOU CONFESS?

05:31.962 --> 05:35.866
BECAUSE MY TIME WITH PAUL
INSPIRED A SPIRITUAL CONVERSION.

05:35.866 --> 05:37.408
THOUGH
THIS NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE

05:37.408 --> 05:39.610
MAY HAVE PUT AN END TO THAT
RATIONALLY CONCEIVED NOTION.

05:39.610 --> 05:41.341
YOU BETTER HOPE HE SURVIVES,

05:41.341 --> 05:44.575
BECAUSE THE DOCTORS ORDERED YOU
NOT TO DRIVE WITH HUNTINGTON'S.

05:44.575 --> 05:47.548
FATHER PAUL'S DEAD.

05:51.021 --> 05:55.355
I KNEW
IT WAS A BAD CHOICE.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.728
HE'S VERY PERSUASIVE.

05:57.728 --> 05:59.990
LOOK, I BOUGHT THAT FERRARI
NEW IN '86.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.893
IT WAS A GIFT TO MYSELF
FOR CRACKING THE FORBES 100.

06:02.893 --> 06:05.135
ANYWAY, PAUL AND I
TEST DROVE IT TOGETHER,

06:05.135 --> 06:07.968
AND HE REALLY SHOWED ME
WHAT THAT CAR COULD DO.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.471
ARE YOU REHEARSING THE SOB STORY
YOU'RE PLANNING ON TELLING

06:10.471 --> 06:12.473
AT YOUR MANSLAUGHTER TRIAL?

06:12.473 --> 06:15.946
NO, MY DEAR, I MERELY
WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

06:15.946 --> 06:18.549
HOW FATHER PAUL CAME TO BE
BEHIND THE WHEEL

06:18.549 --> 06:20.581
AT THE TIME
OF THE ACCIDENT.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.052
WHAT?

06:22.052 --> 06:26.086
HE WANTED TO RELIVE
A MEMORY.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.018
IT BREAKS MY HEART
THAT I LET HIM.

06:28.018 --> 06:31.121
I WILL NOT BE COMPLICIT

06:31.121 --> 06:34.465
IN YOUR RIDICULOUSLY
OBVIOUS LIE.

06:34.465 --> 06:37.698
AND GOOD LUCK
GETTING THE AUTHORITIES

06:37.698 --> 06:40.000
TO SWALLOW THIS TRIPE.

06:44.975 --> 06:49.039
EM... EM, YOU--
YOU WERE FIRST ON THE SCENE.

06:49.039 --> 06:51.642
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

06:51.642 --> 06:55.686
THE CAR WAS ON FIRE.

06:55.686 --> 06:59.820
FATHER PAUL'S BODY WAS THROWN
ABOUT 15 FEET IN FRONT OF IT.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.892
AND WHERE WAS I?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.459
YOU CAME UP FROM BEHIND ME.

07:08.459 --> 07:12.763
I WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE DRIVER'S
SIDE OF THE VEHICLE, CORRECT?

07:14.605 --> 07:16.537
YES.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.909
NOWHERE NEAR.

07:21.572 --> 07:24.174
YOU ARE MY GUARDIAN ANGEL,
EMILY.

07:24.174 --> 07:27.778
LORD KNOWS WHERE I'D BE
WITHOUT YOU.

07:44.495 --> 07:45.666
WELL, THE MAN'S A SURVIVOR.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.638
THAT'S BECAUSE CONRAD
CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.

07:47.638 --> 07:48.999
I DON'T THINK HE EVER
INTENDED TO CONFESS,

07:48.999 --> 07:51.041
AND HE MADE DAMN SURE
THAT FATHER PAUL DIDN'T EITHER.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.943
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW, EMS.

07:52.943 --> 07:54.975
I MEAN,
MURDER BY AUTO ACCIDENT?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.507
CONRAD IS PRETTY PSYCHOTIC,

07:56.507 --> 07:58.008
BUT WHY WOULD HE RISK
HIS OWN LIFE?

07:58.008 --> 07:59.179
WELL, HE'S NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.480
THAT'S A SIDE EFFECT
OF CONVINCING SOMEBODY

08:00.480 --> 08:01.952
THAT THEY'VE GOT
A TERMINAL DISEASE.

08:01.952 --> 08:03.754
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT
THE ELEPHANT IN THE MANSION?

08:03.754 --> 08:06.056
THAT MAYBE THE CRASH
WAS DUE TO ANOTHER

08:06.056 --> 08:08.589
FAKE HUNTINGTON'S
EM-ISODE?

08:08.589 --> 08:10.020
I LOWERED HIS DOSAGE
YESTERDAY

08:10.020 --> 08:12.623
SO HE'D BE HEALTHY ENOUGH
TO TURN HIMSELF IN.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.225
(newspaper thuds)

08:15.225 --> 08:19.069
GOD, IF CONRAD WOULD HAVE BEEN
TOO ILL TO DRIVE...
 HEY--HEY.

08:19.069 --> 08:20.631
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

08:20.631 --> 08:24.034
I NEED TO FIND THE CAR,
PROVE THAT CONRAD WAS DRIVING.

08:24.034 --> 08:26.036
CAN YOU GET ME
INTO THE POLICE DATABASE?

08:26.036 --> 08:29.710
(scoffs) UM, WITH, UH,
MY LIBRARY CARD?

08:29.710 --> 08:32.082
EMS, TECH TIME-OUT,
REMEMBER?

08:32.082 --> 08:36.947
PLUS I, UH, HAVE MY OWN GRAYSON
REVENGE-AGENDA THIS WEEK.

08:38.688 --> 08:40.150
AIDEN, SINCE YOU'RE LIVING
AT THE MANOR,

08:40.150 --> 08:41.991
KEEP YOUR EARS PEELED
AROUND CONRAD.

08:41.991 --> 08:44.024
AND IN THE MEANTIME...

08:44.024 --> 08:47.057
REPLACE HIS MEDICATION
WITH THESE.
 (pills rattle)

08:47.057 --> 08:48.599
MAYBE THERE'S A CHANCE
HE'LL STILL CONFESS

08:48.599 --> 08:50.731
IF HE THINKS
HE'S AT DEATH'S DOOR.

08:52.202 --> 08:54.004
(woman) THANK GOODNESS
CONRAD SURVIVED.

08:54.004 --> 08:56.266
(Victoria) WITH NARY
A LASTING INJURY.

08:56.266 --> 08:59.039
IN FACT, HE'S BEING RELEASED
FROM THE HOSPITAL THIS MORNING.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.141
HOW MUCH MORE
CAN THE POOR MAN ENDURE?

09:01.141 --> 09:04.945
TRUST ME, SHEILA, THAT MAN
WILL ALWAYS RISE ABOVE.

09:04.945 --> 09:08.619
(chuckles) OH, LOOK
AT WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

09:08.619 --> 09:11.622
TURNING THIS INTO
THE HAMPTONS' PREMIERE GALLERY.

09:11.622 --> 09:13.584
HAVING VICTORIA GRAYSON
AS A LOYAL CUSTOMER

09:13.584 --> 09:15.656
HELPED CEMENT
THIS GALLERY'S REPUTATION.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.987
(clicks tongue) OH.

09:16.987 --> 09:18.629
I'M HONORED TO HAVE HELPED YOU
BUILD YOUR COLLECTION.

09:18.629 --> 09:20.060

09:20.060 --> 09:23.063
A FRIENDSHIP OVER THE YEARS
AS WELL.
 OF COURSE WE HAVE.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.596
WELL, I CAN ONLY HOPE
THAT YOU'LL HELP IN TURN.

09:25.596 --> 09:28.699
I USED TO BE AN ART CONSULTANT
MANY YEARS AGO.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.701
AND NOW THAT
I'M AN EMPTY NESTER

09:30.701 --> 09:32.803
WITH A HUSBAND
INCAPABLE OF WORKING,

09:32.803 --> 09:36.677
I WAS LOOKING TO REIGNITE

09:36.677 --> 09:40.180

09:40.180 --> 09:44.655
SO ARE YOU OFFERING UP
YOUR SERVICES OR...

09:44.655 --> 09:46.086
ASKING ME FOR A JOB?

09:46.086 --> 09:49.189
IT'S THE LATTER.

09:51.321 --> 09:54.665
WELL, THEN THE JOB
IS YOURS.

09:55.766 --> 09:57.367
AND, OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE
A WELCOME RECEPTION

09:57.367 --> 09:59.900
TO FETE YOUR RENAISSANCE.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.733
OH, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
WILL BRING TONS OF TRAFFIC

10:02.733 --> 10:04.935
INTO THE GALLERY.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.737
I TRUST YOU'LL CALL
AND INVITE ALL YOUR FRIENDS

10:06.737 --> 10:11.011
TO COME AND SEE THE NEW...
IMPROVED VICTORIA GRAYSON.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.283
I WILL. (chuckles)

10:13.283 --> 10:16.046
AND THANK YOU, SHEILA.

10:16.046 --> 10:18.989
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REPAY
SUCH A KINDNESS.

10:21.992 --> 10:25.125
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance)

10:27.027 --> 10:28.929
(knocks)
 (door creaks)

10:28.929 --> 10:30.130
HEY.
 HEY.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.331
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR MEETING,

10:31.331 --> 10:33.033
BUT I NEEDED TO SEE YOU.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.806
UM, CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THE ACCIDENT FOR A SECOND?

10:35.806 --> 10:38.338
OH, PERFECT TIMING THEN.
THIS IS DETECTIVE MARCH.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.270
HE'LL BE HANDLING
THE INVESTIGATION.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.372
EMILY THORNE.
 OH.

10:42.372 --> 10:43.914
HI.
 HI.

10:43.914 --> 10:46.777
THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE
I WAS THE FIRST ON THE SCENE,

10:46.777 --> 10:49.279
AND NO ONE'S TAKEN MY STATEMENT.
 I ALREADY GAVE IT TO HIM.

10:49.279 --> 10:52.282
YEAH, THEY'RE PRETTY CLEAR
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

10:52.282 --> 10:54.124
YEAH, SEEMS THERE WAS
DRIVER ERROR

10:54.124 --> 10:55.085
ON FATHER PAUL'S PART.

10:55.085 --> 10:57.257
HE JUST TOOK THE CURVE
TOO FAST.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.359
LOST CONTROL.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.762
AND FOR HIS QUICK RESPONSE...
 (pen clatters)

11:01.762 --> 11:04.064
THE GRAYSONS ARE PROUD TO
SUPPORT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

11:06.036 --> 11:07.998
WELL, THEN I GUESS
THAT'S SETTLED.

11:07.998 --> 11:10.971
YEAH, IT WILL BE.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?
 MM.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.803
YEAH.

11:12.803 --> 11:15.105
(indistinct conversations)

11:15.105 --> 11:18.308
UM, MISS THORNE?
MISS THORNE?

11:18.308 --> 11:19.880
HEY.
 HI.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.782
DID MR. GRAYSON LOOK
ALMOST FINISHED?

11:21.782 --> 11:23.213
BECAUSE THE MAGAZINE
LAUNCHES NEXT WEEK,

11:23.213 --> 11:26.016
AND HIS PUBLISHER'S BIO IS DUE
TO THE PRINTER IN MINUTES.

11:26.016 --> 11:29.359
THE PROFILE INTRODUCING DANIEL
TO THE READERS OF "VOULEZ"?

11:29.359 --> 11:31.121
EXACTLY. AND MS. LeMARCHAL
WILL HAVE ME FIRED

11:31.121 --> 11:33.363
UNLESS I GET AT LEAST
ONE PERSONAL DETAIL ABOUT HIM.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.028
WELL...

11:38.028 --> 11:40.971
I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
A STATEMENT.

11:40.971 --> 11:43.373
(waves crashing)

11:48.478 --> 11:51.081
(seagulls cry)

11:51.081 --> 11:54.414
(sighs and clears throat)

11:54.414 --> 11:56.046
NOLAN.

11:56.046 --> 11:57.748
PATRICK. (chuckles)

11:57.748 --> 11:59.319
YOU KNOW, FOR A GUY
WITH AN AMAZING POOL,

11:59.319 --> 12:01.051
YOU SURE DO SPEND A LOT
OF TIME AT THIS BEACH CLUB.

12:01.051 --> 12:02.322
(scoffs)

12:02.322 --> 12:05.926
I'M JUST... TRYING TO JUSTIFY
THE KING'S RANSOM

12:05.926 --> 12:08.999
I SPEND IN MEMBERSHIP DUES.
 AH.

12:08.999 --> 12:13.063
SO... WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO OUR PRISTINE SHORES?

12:13.063 --> 12:16.066
UM...

12:16.066 --> 12:18.268
THE INEVITABILITY
OF THE TIDE.

12:20.170 --> 12:23.013
WHAT COMES IN
MUST GO OUT, RIGHT?

12:23.013 --> 12:26.016
THINKING MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO MOVE ON.

12:26.016 --> 12:28.448
LEAVING THE HAMPTONS
SO SOON?

12:28.448 --> 12:31.021
YOU EVER FEEL LIKE
YOU DON'T BELONG?

12:31.021 --> 12:34.424
STORY OF MY LIFE.

12:34.424 --> 12:37.828
(waves crashing)

12:37.828 --> 12:39.029
ENJOY THE BEACH.

12:39.029 --> 12:41.461
I'M GONNA GO FOR A SWIM.

12:44.094 --> 12:46.096
(sighs)

12:51.041 --> 12:54.044
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

12:57.347 --> 13:00.110
CHARLOTTE, DEAR...

13:00.110 --> 13:04.084
UH, COULD YOU...
PLEASE CALL ME BACK?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.356
ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME...

13:06.356 --> 13:08.158
(line beeps)

13:08.158 --> 13:11.121
(beep)

13:12.863 --> 13:15.795
WHAT IS IT, DETECTIVE?

13:15.795 --> 13:19.199
OH, I HAD IT MOVED OFF SITE.
DANIEL DIDN'T TELL YOU?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.501
PIEDMONT SALVAGE YARD.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.233
YEAH, HAVE IT
TAKEN CARE OF QUICKLY.

13:23.233 --> 13:25.475
AND, UH, DON'T CALL AGAIN.

13:25.475 --> 13:27.037
(cell phone beeps)
 WELCOME HOME.

13:29.539 --> 13:31.842
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:31.842 --> 13:34.344
I JUST MOVED
INTO YOUR POOL HOUSE.

13:34.344 --> 13:35.986
OH, WELL, I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH THE POLICE.

13:35.986 --> 13:38.018
I'M HAPPY TO CALL THEM BACK.
 WHY?

13:38.018 --> 13:41.251
SO YOU CAN HAVE ME ARRESTED
ON ANOTHER TRUMPED UP CHARGE?

13:41.251 --> 13:43.023
OR ARE YOU SCARED?

13:43.023 --> 13:45.425
OF BEING KILLED IN MY SLEEP
BY A COWARD LIKE YOU?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.097
DAMN STRAIGHT.

13:47.097 --> 13:50.530
BIANCA, COULD YOU PLEASE INFORM
THE STAFF THAT MR. MATHIS HERE

13:50.530 --> 13:52.402
IS TO BE DENIED ACCESS
TO THE MANOR?

13:52.402 --> 13:54.834
AND, UH, HAVE THE DOORS
TO MY SUITE AND STUDY

13:54.834 --> 13:59.169
LOCKED AT ALL TIMES DURING
HIS INEVITABLY SHORT STAY.

13:59.169 --> 14:01.611
YES, MR. GRAYSON.

14:01.611 --> 14:04.044
SO WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO YOUR CABANA?

14:04.044 --> 14:07.117
AND THEN PREPARE TO KEEP GOING
BACK OVER THE OCEAN.

14:07.117 --> 14:08.378
WELL, IF YOU STILL
RAN THIS HOUSE,

14:08.378 --> 14:11.051
I... MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE SCARED.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.192
(dialing cell phone)

14:22.192 --> 14:23.593
(lowered voice) CONRAD'S CAR
IS AT PIEDMONT SALVAGE YARD,

14:23.593 --> 14:25.065
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT

14:25.065 --> 14:26.937
DANIEL'S IN
THE THICK OF IT, TOO.

14:26.937 --> 14:29.169
I KNOW. I JUST CAUGHT HIM
GIVING MY STATEMENT

14:29.169 --> 14:31.201
TO THE OFFICER
HANDLING THE CASE.

14:31.201 --> 14:32.973
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M SURPRISED, BUT I AM.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.976
THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE
CAN BE TRUSTED.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.978
EMILY, LOOK, I'M--
I'M SORRY. I KNOW THIS IS

14:37.978 --> 14:40.210
THE CLOSEST YOU'VE COME
TO CLEARING YOUR FATHER'S NAME.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.982
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.954
Well, at least--
at least take a minute.

14:43.954 --> 14:45.215
OKAY, I-I KNOW YOU
WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW

14:45.215 --> 14:48.388
THAT YOU'RE NOT OKAY.
JUST...

14:48.388 --> 14:49.589
TALK TO ME.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.391
I'm fine.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.163

16:30.460 --> 16:31.521

WERE YOU THINKING?!

HOW FAR YOU'VE COME.

OH, NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE
A SMART WOMAN, EMILY THORNE.

16:38.028 --> 16:39.569
THIS WAS PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

16:39.569 --> 16:41.071
HELL, THIS WAS AGGRESSIVE.
YOU WERE--

16:41.071 --> 16:42.702
YOU WERE TRYING TO HURT ME.
 THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.034
IS IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
TOO BUSY WITH WORK?

16:44.034 --> 16:46.176
IS THAT WHY?
COME ON. GIVE ME A REASON.

16:46.176 --> 16:47.137

16:47.137 --> 16:49.439
HOW DARE YOU
DEMAND THE TRUTH.

16:49.439 --> 16:50.780
YOU'RE RIGHT, DANIEL.
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

16:50.780 --> 16:52.312
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
WAS HAPPENING THIS MORNING.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.144
OH, AND THIS WAS
IN RETALIATION?

16:54.144 --> 16:55.745
DID YOU STOP FOR A SECOND
TO THINK ABOUT

16:55.745 --> 16:57.187
WHY I HELPED MY FATHER?

16:57.187 --> 16:59.049
DOES IT MATTER?
IT'S DISGUSTING.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.221
(chuckles)
 I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BETTER THAN CONRAD,

17:01.221 --> 17:03.223
BUT YOU'RE JUST
AS WRAPPED UP IN HIS LIES.
 YEAH, RIGHT,

17:03.223 --> 17:05.655
'CAUSE YOU'RE SUCH AN OPEN BOOK.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:05.655 --> 17:07.026
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.228
YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR,

17:08.228 --> 17:09.628
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

17:09.628 --> 17:12.102
THEN DON'T FORGET
TO TURN ON THE ALARM.

17:12.102 --> 17:14.134

17:14.134 --> 17:16.736

17:18.738 --> 17:21.810
I'LL SEE YOU THEN. BYE, NOW.

17:21.810 --> 17:23.213

I SEE.

17:23.213 --> 17:26.175
(chuckles) WELL,
THE MORE CLIENTS I SECURE,

17:26.175 --> 17:28.147
THE FASTER I'LL BE FISCALLY
INDEPENDENT FROM THIS MARRIAGE.

17:28.147 --> 17:31.181
AND I WANT THAT GALLERY
SWARMING.

17:31.181 --> 17:34.124
ALTHOUGH I'M LOATHE TO ENDURE

17:34.124 --> 17:36.186

17:36.186 --> 17:37.527
WELL, LET 'EM STARE.

17:37.527 --> 17:39.429
THEN WHEN YOU'RE BACK ON TOP,
THEY'LL KISS YOUR ASS.

17:39.429 --> 17:42.332
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A WALK WITH ME ON THE BEACH?

17:42.332 --> 17:44.164
IT'S WHERE I GO
TO CLEAR THE COBWEBS.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.736
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO,
BUT I HAVE INVITES TO EXTEND,

17:46.736 --> 17:48.638
AND I NEED TO REACH OUT
TO DANIEL AND CHARLOTTE.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.103
I REALLY NEED THEIR SUPPORT.

17:58.208 --> 18:00.210

NO.

18:14.324 --> 18:16.166
NOLAN. (chuckles)

18:16.166 --> 18:18.628
NO TECHNOLOGY.

18:18.628 --> 18:20.630

INTO TROUBLE.

18:22.302 --> 18:27.137
OH. JUST... ONCE... (mutters)

18:27.137 --> 18:28.708
THEN I CAN STOP.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.840
(chuckles)
I CAN STOP ANYTIME.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.342
(clatters, drawer closes)

18:32.342 --> 18:35.145
AND IF I CAN'T STOP,
THEN I CAN WRITE A PROGRAM...

18:35.145 --> 18:38.288
THAT WILL MAKE ME STOP.

18:38.288 --> 18:39.889
(clacks)

18:41.591 --> 18:44.224
(key clicks, laptop beeps)
 (sighs) OH...

18:44.224 --> 18:48.158
(computer powers up)
 SWEET CHORD OF CONNECTIVITY.

18:48.158 --> 18:52.162
(typing)
 COME TO PAPA.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.221
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
 IT IS.

19:11.221 --> 19:13.683
AND IT'S ALSO
VICTORIA GRAYSON'S.

19:13.683 --> 19:16.626
SO MIGHT I ASK HOW
IT CAME TO BE IN YOUR HANDS?

19:16.626 --> 19:19.789
OH, UM... I'M HER SON.

19:19.789 --> 19:23.833
AH.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.495
(sets down glass)
 I HAD HEARD THROUGH
THE GRAPEVINE

19:25.495 --> 19:28.538
THAT VICTORIA'S FIRST BORN
HAD... RESURFACED.

19:28.538 --> 19:33.443
AND NOW HE STANDS HERE
INTENDING...

19:33.443 --> 19:35.345
IF I CATCH YOUR DRIFT--

19:35.345 --> 19:38.878
TO FENCE ONE
OF HER MORE VALUABLE PIECES?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.210
WELL, I'M LEAVING
THE HAMPTONS,

19:40.210 --> 19:43.413
AND I COULD USE
A LITTLE TRAVELING MONEY.

19:43.413 --> 19:45.285
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.417
I'M A BASTARD
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.
 (chuckles)

19:47.417 --> 19:49.789
AS MUCH AS I LOVE IT,
I SIMPLY CAN'T RISK

19:49.789 --> 19:51.891
PURCHASING A PIECE
OF THIS CALIBER

19:51.891 --> 19:54.694
WITHOUT
THE PROPER PAPERWORK.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.466
IT'S ILLEGAL.

19:56.466 --> 20:01.200
HEY, HOW'S THE SULTAN ENJOYING
HIS POLLOCK, BY THE WAY?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.303
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR HOBBY
OF, UH...

20:03.303 --> 20:06.706
SOMEHOW ACQUIRING CERTAIN
RARE AND VALUABLE PIECES

20:06.706 --> 20:08.478
AND THEN PRIVATELY
RESELLING THEM

20:08.478 --> 20:10.740
TO HIGH-END
INTERNATIONAL BUYERS.

20:10.740 --> 20:13.443
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THE GRAPEVINE WAS WRONG.

20:13.443 --> 20:16.716
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.
THIS IS A VALUABLE PIECE.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.718

20:20.290 --> 20:21.991
HOW SHOULD WE HANDLE THIS?

20:21.991 --> 20:24.694

20:33.433 --> 20:36.436
(vehicle's reverse alert
beeping)

20:39.309 --> 20:41.271
(Jack) YOU KNOW,
THE MORE I KNOW YOU,

20:41.271 --> 20:42.872
THE LESS I KNOW YOU.
 (lowered voice) JACK,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:42.872 --> 20:44.944
YOU CAN'T BE HERE!
 AND YOU CAN?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.746
I'M NOT JUST GONNA
SIT AROUND

20:46.746 --> 20:49.949
AND LET CONRAD
GET AWAY WITH MURDER.
 LET ME DEAL WITH HIM.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.823
WE CAN FIGHT,
OR WE CAN GET TO WORK.

20:53.823 --> 20:55.625

20:55.625 --> 20:57.256

20:57.256 --> 20:59.258

20:59.258 --> 21:02.432

OF THE ENTIRE CAR.

21:02.432 --> 21:04.864
LOOK AT THE STEERING WHEEL.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.537
THAT'S HOUSING FOR AN AIR BAG
THAT CONRAD HAD INSTALLED.

21:07.537 --> 21:09.469
THOUGH IT MUST HAVE DEPLOYED
WHEN THE CAR HIT THE POLE.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.571
THAT'S WHY CONRAD
HAS BURNS ON HIS FACE

21:11.571 --> 21:13.443
AND FATHER PAUL DOESN'T.

21:13.443 --> 21:16.045
THIS COULD REALLY PROVE
THAT CONRAD WAS DRIVING,

21:16.045 --> 21:17.547
WHICH MEANS THAT HE HAD
THE AIR BAG

21:17.547 --> 21:19.979
REMOVED AND DESTROYED
BEFORE THEY TOWED THE CAR.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.982

21:28.358 --> 21:30.960

21:37.327 --> 21:41.030

21:41.030 --> 21:42.932
JACK, LOOK,
JUST GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

21:42.932 --> 21:44.874
I'LL DOWNLOAD THE VIDEO
AND TAKE CARE OF IT.

21:44.874 --> 21:46.075
NO.
 JACK--

21:46.075 --> 21:47.707
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
MY MOMENT

21:47.707 --> 21:49.979
TO MAKE THIS BASTARD PAY,

21:49.979 --> 21:51.411
(whispers)
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.882
THERE COULD BE
CONSEQUENCES.

21:52.882 --> 21:55.515

YOU LIED TO ME FOR TWO YEARS.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.016
(huffs)

21:57.016 --> 21:58.948

THIS TRUTH...

HON?

22:27.016 --> 22:28.578
(sighs) I FOUND PROOF.

22:28.578 --> 22:31.851
CONRAD SHOULD BE ARRESTED
SOMETIME TODAY.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.785
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
SO ISN'T THAT GOOD NEWS?

22:35.785 --> 22:38.858
NO. BECAUSE JACK CAME
TO THE SALVAGE YARD LAST NIGHT

22:38.858 --> 22:40.560
AND DEMANDED
 HE DO THE HONORS.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.832
I THOUGHT YOU PROMISED NEVER
TO PULL HIM INTO THIS.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.494
I DIDN'T.
HE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

PLEASE. PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, NO, I...
 (receiver clatters)

30:42.471 --> 30:46.845
OKAY... WHILE THIS STARTED
AS MY WELCOMING PARTY,

30:46.845 --> 30:49.949
IT'S NOW YOUR FAREWELL
TO THE HAMPTONS.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.581
SO GO OUT THERE
AND TELL EVERYONE

30:52.581 --> 30:55.284
THAT THIS IS
MY GALLERY NOW...

30:57.226 --> 30:58.888
RIGHT AFTER YOU
CHANGE THIS BULB.

31:12.241 --> 31:13.872
(switch clicks)

31:19.078 --> 31:21.080
(engine turns off)

31:21.080 --> 31:22.211
(lock turns)

31:22.211 --> 31:23.482
(car door closes)

31:26.515 --> 31:28.657
(keys jingle)
 JORDAN GOT THE RANDOLPH
BACK TO ME IN MINT CONDITION.

31:28.657 --> 31:30.659
AND OUR PLAN WORKED
PERFECTLY.

31:30.659 --> 31:32.121
THE GALLERY'S MINE.

31:32.121 --> 31:34.523
SEE? I KNEW YOU STILL HAD
A LITTLE HARPER IN YOU.

31:34.523 --> 31:37.226
YOU TOOK A HUGE RISK
JUST TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

31:37.226 --> 31:39.068
NEITHER DANIEL NOR CHARLOTTE

31:39.068 --> 31:40.930
HAVE EVER MADE ME FEEL
SO SPECIAL.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.037
(Gospel Claws)
 ♪ I MOVE AROUND ♪

31:48.037 --> 31:49.478
♪ AND I DO WHAT I WANT ♪

31:49.478 --> 31:53.142
♪ I MOVE AROUND,
 AND I DO WHAT I WANT ♪

31:53.142 --> 31:56.115
SORRY I HAVEN'T RETURNED
YOUR MESSAGES.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.286
I JUST GOT BACK.

31:57.286 --> 31:59.018
FROM HANDING OVER
THE EVIDENCE?

31:59.018 --> 32:00.489
I'VE BEEN BURNED
TOO MANY TIMES

32:00.489 --> 32:03.993
BY ACCEPTING WHAT'S
IN FRONT OF ME AS TRUE.

32:03.993 --> 32:07.096
SO BEFORE I TURN THIS IN,
I WANTED TO RUN IT BY VINCE.

32:07.096 --> 32:09.098
HE'S A MECHANIC.

32:09.098 --> 32:12.431
WE WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE AIR BAG.

32:12.431 --> 32:16.335
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.536
THIS IS
THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR

32:17.536 --> 32:19.068
IN THE TRUNK
OF CONRAD'S CAR.

32:19.068 --> 32:21.940
AND THAT IS A PUNCTURE
THAT VINCE SAYS

32:21.940 --> 32:23.942
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE
BY THE IMPACT.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.214
SOMEONE TAMPERED
WITH THE BRAKES.

32:25.214 --> 32:26.575
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED
THE ACCIDENT.

32:26.575 --> 32:30.079
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO WAS DRIVING.

32:30.079 --> 32:32.121
I THOUGHT I HAD HIM.
I THOUGHT I HAD HIM.

32:32.121 --> 32:33.422
(cell phone chimes)

32:35.985 --> 32:37.426
(beep)

32:39.128 --> 32:40.589
I HAVE TO GO.

32:40.589 --> 32:43.032
CONRAD HAS NEWS.

32:43.032 --> 32:46.135
OH. KEEP ME IN THE LOOP.

32:46.135 --> 32:50.039
IF I'M IN DANGER AGAIN,
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

32:50.039 --> 32:51.240
(door closes)

32:54.443 --> 32:56.175
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THIS IS RECKLESS.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.147
SOMEONE TAMPERED
WITH CONRAD'S BRAKES.

32:58.147 --> 33:00.049
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH
AND KILLED FATHER PAUL.

33:01.650 --> 33:03.212
AIDEN, I NEED TO KNOW
IT WASN'T YOU.

33:03.212 --> 33:06.055
AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE,
YOU STILL DON'T TRUST ME?

33:06.055 --> 33:07.456
YOU'VE GONE ROGUE BEFORE.

33:09.088 --> 33:12.191
JUST TELL ME.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.993
I DIDN'T DO IT.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.127
I CAME BACK HERE TO HELP YOU
FINISH THIS YOUR WAY.

33:18.127 --> 33:21.170
(sighs)

33:21.170 --> 33:23.102
OKAY.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.773
SO HOW DID YOU KNOW

33:24.773 --> 33:27.005
THAT CONRAD'S BRAKES
WERE TAMPERED WITH?

33:27.005 --> 33:30.639
THERE'S PROOF.
BUT I DON'T HAVE IT.

33:30.639 --> 33:34.383
JACK DOES.

33:36.115 --> 33:40.049
WH--PORTER. YOU--YOU--
YOU WENT TO HIM, BUT HOW?

33:40.049 --> 33:42.721
(inhales deeply)

33:42.721 --> 33:45.224
DOES JACK KNOW
WHO YOU REALLY ARE?

33:48.557 --> 33:51.130
HOW LONG?

33:51.130 --> 33:52.731
SINCE THE NIGHT
OF THE ELECTION.

33:52.731 --> 33:56.705
HE WAS GOING TO KILL CONRAD.
I HAD TO PROTECT HIM.

33:56.705 --> 34:00.038
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.
I'M SORRY.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.372
(footsteps retreat)

34:03.372 --> 34:05.074
(Victoria) WELL,
I THINK MARK'S FATHER

34:05.074 --> 34:06.115
HAD A HUGE INFLUENCE
ON HIM.

34:06.115 --> 34:08.516
REALLY? OH.

34:08.516 --> 34:12.081
WHAT'S THE NEWS?
 I DON'T KNOW.

34:12.081 --> 34:15.583
MY FATHER INSISTED
WE ALL BE HERE, SO...

34:15.583 --> 34:20.129
HMM. UNSEASONABLY CHILLY
TONIGHT, ISN'T IT, EMILY?

34:23.831 --> 34:26.165
(unscrews bottle lid)

34:26.165 --> 34:27.536
(pills rattle)

34:27.536 --> 34:30.239
(clattering)

34:30.239 --> 34:34.172
(crunching)

34:34.172 --> 34:36.074
WHILE I ADORE
PERFORMANCE ART,

34:36.074 --> 34:38.277
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET ON WITH IT?

34:38.277 --> 34:41.179
I RECEIVED A CALL
FROM THE HOSPITAL TODAY,

34:41.179 --> 34:43.452
ASKING ME TO COME BACK
FOR AN M.R.I.,

34:43.452 --> 34:48.417
WHICH CONFIRMED...
A SHOCKING DISCOVERY.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.789
I'VE BEEN MISDIAGNOSED.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.821
AND I DO NOT,
NOR HAVE I EVER

34:52.821 --> 34:56.125
SUFFERED FROM
HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE.
 WHAT? (scoffs)

34:56.125 --> 34:59.828
HOW DID THEY EXPLAIN
THE SYMPTOMS?

34:59.828 --> 35:02.431
SEEMS THEY WERE
BROUGHT ON BY STRESS

35:02.431 --> 35:05.274
AND THE HUNTINGTON'S
MEDICATION ITSELF.

35:06.405 --> 35:09.178
I REALIZE NOW WHAT FATHER PAUL
MEANT WHEN HE SAID

35:09.178 --> 35:10.509
THAT HE'D BEEN BROUGHT BACK
INTO MY LIFE

35:10.509 --> 35:11.880
THROUGH DIVINE INTERVENTION.

35:11.880 --> 35:15.544
I MEAN, HE WAS GOD'S VESSEL
TO SHOW ME THAT I'M MEANT

35:15.544 --> 35:18.887
TO LIVE A LONG AND MEANINGFUL
EXISTENCE HERE ON EARTH.

35:18.887 --> 35:23.121
AND FATHER PAUL IS NOW
DOUBTLESS IN HEAVEN,

35:23.121 --> 35:24.453
HAVING EARNED HIS WINGS.

35:24.453 --> 35:25.794
WELL, MAYBE
HE'S LAUGHING AT YOU

35:25.794 --> 35:28.727
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO STEP DOWN
AS GOVERNOR FOR NAUGHT.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.799
I KNOW I CERTAINLY AM.

35:30.799 --> 35:32.201
WELL, BEING GOVERNOR

35:32.201 --> 35:34.903
MERELY DISTRACTED ME
FROM MY TRUE DESTINY--

35:34.903 --> 35:38.837
LEADING THIS FAMILY.
AND SO THE FIRST STEP

35:38.837 --> 35:41.710
IS RECLAIMING
MY RIGHTFUL POSITION

35:41.710 --> 35:44.813
AS MASTER OF THIS HOUSE.

35:50.719 --> 35:52.751
(Conrad sips)

36:08.597 --> 36:10.899
YOU MUST BE HAPPY.

36:10.899 --> 36:13.742
YOUR FATHER'S MISDIAGNOSIS
MEANS YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR, TOO.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.478
(sighs) WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ONE OF THOSE IN A FEW WEEKS.

36:20.779 --> 36:23.512
YOU SURE YOU WANT IT?

36:25.284 --> 36:26.915
YOU QUESTIONED
THE TYPE OF MAN I AM

36:26.915 --> 36:29.618
IN PRINT...
AND TO MY FACE.

36:29.618 --> 36:31.960
SORRY I QUESTIONED YOU.

36:31.960 --> 36:35.764
IF I HAD A FAMILY, I'D DO
ANYTHING TO PROTECT THEM.

36:35.764 --> 36:38.467
DANIEL, I WANT NOTHING MORE
THAN TO MARRY YOU.

36:40.469 --> 36:42.301
WHY?

36:42.301 --> 36:44.433
I DON'T THINK YOU EVER
TOLD ME WHY.

36:44.433 --> 36:47.406
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.740
NOW COME ON.
LET'S GO HOME.

36:54.343 --> 36:56.645
I'M GONNA STAY AT
THE SOUTH FORK AGAIN, OKAY?

36:56.645 --> 36:59.618
DANIEL.
 SEE YOU TOMORROW.

37:02.291 --> 37:03.622
(door opens)

37:03.622 --> 37:04.853
(Patrick) WHERE'D YOU SAY
YOU FOUND MY WALLET AGAIN?

37:04.853 --> 37:07.526
WELL, I WENT BACK
TO THE BEACH CLUB

37:07.526 --> 37:09.898
AFTER I SAW YOU THERE
IN HOPES THAT

37:09.898 --> 37:11.560
I'D BUMP INTO YOU AGAIN.

37:11.560 --> 37:15.434
NO BUMP, BUT, UH,
YOUR WALLET WAS THERE.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.407
(chuckles) LUCKY YOU,
THAT I FOUND IT.

37:18.407 --> 37:20.008
WHY WERE YOU
LOOKING FOR ME?

37:20.008 --> 37:23.272
MAYBE...
BECAUSE YOU INTRIGUE ME.

37:23.272 --> 37:26.875
VICTORIA'S MYSTERIOUS SON.

37:26.875 --> 37:30.819
WHAT ON EARTH IS HE UP TO
IN THE HAMPTONS?

37:30.819 --> 37:35.384
AND... WHY IS HE ALWAYS
IN SUCH A RUSH TO LEAVE?

37:35.384 --> 37:38.457
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

37:38.457 --> 37:41.029
SOMETHING THAT
MADE ME HAPPY YOU STAYED.

37:47.035 --> 37:48.637
(sighs)

37:48.637 --> 37:50.569
THAT WAS A BIT
PRESUMPTUOUS.

37:52.601 --> 37:55.444
(chuckles nervously)
UM...

37:55.444 --> 37:59.348
LOOK, I'M, UH...
I-I'M SORRY.

37:59.348 --> 38:02.751
I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOWED UP AT MY PARTY,

38:02.751 --> 38:05.484
AND WE SAW EACH OTHER
AT THE BEACH CLUB,

38:05.484 --> 38:08.917
THAT MAYBE WE, UH...
(inhales sharply)

38:08.917 --> 38:10.489
(clicks teeth)

38:12.561 --> 38:13.792
WE DID.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.775
(sighs) HAVE MERCY.

38:29.378 --> 38:30.879
HOW ABOUT JUST
A GLASS OF WINE?

38:30.879 --> 38:34.543
YEAH... THAT, TOO.

39:59.027 --> 40:01.399
I DESERVE TO BE THERE.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.732
I WANT TO BE THERE WHEN
THEY GET WHAT'S COMING TO THEM.

40:03.732 --> 40:05.073
NO, YOU DON'T.

40:05.073 --> 40:08.777
GO BACK TO YOUR LIFE, JACK...
TO CARL.

40:08.777 --> 40:10.709
YOU DON'T BELONG IN THIS.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.426
YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE PROPERLY

40:28.426 --> 40:32.531
CONGRATULATED YOU
ON YOUR NEW AMUSEMENT.

40:32.531 --> 40:33.832
WELL, IT'S MORE
THAN YOU'RE DOING,

40:33.832 --> 40:36.535
AND IT'S MY TICKET
TO FREEDOM FROM YOU.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.467
SO GET OUT.
I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

40:38.467 --> 40:40.809
(chuckles)

40:40.809 --> 40:44.543
THERE'S THAT SPUNK
I FELL IN LOVE WITH.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.845
AND I WILL LEAVE
JUST AS SOON AS YOU

40:46.845 --> 40:49.548
DESCRIBE TO ME
MR. MATHIS' EXIT PLAN.

40:49.548 --> 40:53.121
SO YOU HAVE UNTIL BREAKFAST
TO REMOVE HIM,

40:53.121 --> 40:56.224
OR...
I'LL DO IT MY WAY.

40:56.224 --> 40:58.456
NOW THAT WOULD BE UNWISE.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.928
AIDEN MAY BE
THE ONLY HOPE WE HAVE

40:59.928 --> 41:02.160
OF STOPPING DANIEL
FROM MARRYING EMILY.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.594
IT SEEMS THAT SHE HAS SOME
INEXPLICABLE WEAKNESS FOR HIM.

41:05.594 --> 41:08.667
GOD, ARE YOU STILL CHEWING
THAT SAME BONE, WOMAN?

41:08.667 --> 41:11.640
USE THAT TENACITY TO GET HIM
OUT OF MY POOL HOUSE.

41:11.640 --> 41:15.604
YOU MAY WANT
TO RETHINK THAT IDEA.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.678
I LOOKED
INTO YOUR ACCIDENT.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.580
AND WHY WAS IT YOUR CONCERN?

41:21.580 --> 41:24.583
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE YOU.
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE

41:24.583 --> 41:26.484
YOU'D INTENTIONALLY HARMED
THAT PRIEST,

41:26.484 --> 41:28.216
BUT I DISCOVERED SOMETHING
FAR MORE SURPRISING.

41:29.888 --> 41:33.491
SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL YOU
BY TAMPERING WITH YOUR BRAKES.

41:34.663 --> 41:36.124
AND I HAVE GOOD REASON
TO BELIEVE

41:36.124 --> 41:37.666
IT'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW WELL.

41:37.666 --> 41:39.598
AND I IMAGINE
I'M LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.269
NO, CONRAD.

41:43.532 --> 41:46.675
JACK PORTER WANTS YOU DEAD.
