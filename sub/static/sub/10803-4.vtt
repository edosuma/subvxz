00:12.929 --> 00:16.557
why is it so important
that you find this man?

00:16.725 --> 00:18.684
We had business dealings.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.436
He owes me money.

00:20.603 --> 00:24.565
Hmm. Well, if we had
business dealings,

00:24.733 --> 00:27.443
I can tell you that
I wouldn't disappear.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.654
Maybe we can discuss
that possibility.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.867
- Ooh.
- But first, I have to find him,

00:35.035 --> 00:37.161

00:37.662 --> 00:40.289

Perhaps we could, uh,
discuss this more privately.

00:47.005 --> 00:50.841
If I don't find him,
I'm going to have to move on.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.511

I thought so.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.619
Listen, people that come in here,

01:18.787 --> 01:22.873
they count on a certain amount
of anonymity.

answering questions about them,

01:27.420 --> 01:30.589

I think the one over there
knows something.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.376
He would not admit
to having seen the captain,

02:07.544 --> 02:11.213
but he said anyone
who visited the ruins of Nafir

02:11.381 --> 02:13.715
would probably come here
eventually.

My friend tells me you know something
about the man we're looking for.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.606
The only reason l'm talking to you
is that I have a sister too.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.944
I explained to him
that we're looking for a man

02:34.112 --> 02:36.613
who impregnated your sister.

how much this means to me.

Family honor is important.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.789
If someone had defiled my sister,

I would do anything, pay anything,
to find the one responsible.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.463

02:54.174 --> 02:58.343
As much as five bars

a little too much to drink.

I wouldn't cross her.

03:19.699 --> 03:24.077
You say one word,

03:24.996 --> 03:26.496
Perhaps there's an element
of risk here

03:26.664 --> 03:28.707
that I did not fully appreciate.

03:28.917 --> 03:33.921
Hmm. And how much more latinum
will it take to offset this risk?

03:34.088 --> 03:35.881
This isn't about latinum.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.801
As a man with a sister,
a sister with a temper,

Who were these aliens?

I don't know,
but they looked dangerous.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.206
They attacked him.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.958
He managed to incapacitate
three of them

04:11.125 --> 04:12.709
before he was knocked down.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.045
He was thrown against that wall

04:30.019 --> 04:31.561
The cell structures
are badly distorted.

to some kind of high-energy field.

Mr. Worf, I'd like a security detail

14:49.972 --> 14:51.598
to accompany the away team
to the surface.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.850
I'll lead the away team.
Geordi, you're with me.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.185
- Mr. Data, you have the Bridge.
- Aye, sir.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.937
Commander.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.940
As acting first officer,

15:01.108 --> 15:03.651
I must question your decision
to accompany the away team.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.862
- If Captain Picard were here--
- He's not.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.530
I realize that, sir.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.825
But if he were and he wanted
to lead an away team,

15:10.993 --> 15:12.744
you would tell him
that the captain's place--

15:12.912 --> 15:14.579
Is on the Bridge.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.539
Not this time.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.175
- Ensign, you take that area.
- Yes, sir.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.722
Here, sir.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.390
Geordi?

15:35.809 --> 15:37.477
It's tough to get
accurate sensor readings.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.562
There's an awful lot of interference
in the area.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.648
- From what?
- I'm not sure.

15:41.815 --> 15:45.068
It's very unlocalized,
but it could be atmospheric.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.654
What do you make of these?

15:54.662 --> 15:57.288
Well, these ruins around here
are pretty ancient,

15:57.456 --> 16:01.250
but I'd say that this indentation
was made fairly recently.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.670
Could be the site of some battlefield.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.047
This doesn't look like any blast point
I've ever seen.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.757
The shape is too perfect.

16:07.925 --> 16:12.095
Commander, there's micro-crystalline
damage all throughout this area.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.931
It's the same kind of pattern
that Dr. Crusher picked up

16:15.099 --> 16:17.392

with the away team.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.689
Sir, the mercenaries
have beamed away.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.192
They must have a base
or a ship nearby.

Can the sensors locate anything?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.114
Commander,
we're picking up a vessel leaving orbit.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.740
Why was it not detected earlier?

18:37.908 --> 18:40.118
They could have been using the planet
as a shield.

of that ship is extremely weak.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.119
It's fading.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.665
The ship doesn't register
on the long-range sensors.

Aye, sir.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.615
Starfleet lntelligence confirms
that a ship matching this configuration

20:00.782 --> 20:04.285
has been linked to raids
on several other planets in this sector.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.871
For the short time
it was within our visual range,

20:07.039 --> 20:10.166
we were able to take sensor readings
of the mercenary vessel.

20:11.001 --> 20:14.712
It appears to be encased
in an energy-absorbing material.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.339
Although we can see the ship,

20:16.506 --> 20:19.634
this energy sheath
renders it virtually undetectable

20:19.801 --> 20:21.260
to our long-range sensors.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.638
There must be some way
we can track it.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.515
Data, I know this is a long shot,

20:26.683 --> 20:29.352
but if I remodulate
the long-range sensor array,

20:29.519 --> 20:32.980
I might be able to make it
sensitive enough to detect the ship.

20:33.148 --> 20:36.275
Without a full compositional analysis
of the energy sheath,

20:36.443 --> 20:39.695
chances of finding the correct
remodulation sequence are remote.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.406
Sir, they have taken
Commander Riker.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.826
We must do something.
We cannot just sit here.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.955
On the contrary, lieutenant,

20:49.122 --> 20:51.832
that is precisely what we must do.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.259
Since there are
no viable alternatives,

21:01.426 --> 21:03.761
we will return to the surface
and attempt to determine

21:03.929 --> 21:05.972
what these mercenaries are doing
on this planet.

I can try to realign the warp core.
It'll take at least 1 1 hours.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.321
The search teams have reported in.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.657
They found
several archaeological sites.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.158
Each one has been looted.

28:23.326 --> 28:26.829
It's possible that the micro-crystalline
damage I found in these indentations

28:26.996 --> 28:30.332
is the result of some kind
of high-energy transporter beam.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.584
But l still don't understand.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.629
There's nothing here
that's particularly valuable.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.507
Why would anyone
wanna steal any of these things?

28:38.675 --> 28:41.927
Perhaps these artifacts
have a special value to the Romulans.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.471
The Romulans?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.850
These structures
were built by the Debrune.

28:48.017 --> 28:50.936
That race is an ancient offshoot
of the Romulans.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.689
The ruins on the planet
where Captain Picard was killed

28:53.857 --> 28:55.441
were also Romulan in origin.

28:55.608 --> 28:57.693
The leader of the group
that attacked us was Romulan.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.695
Perhaps they are controlling
the mercenaries.

29:00.363 --> 29:04.324
The question remains,
why are they stealing these artifacts?

29:11.374 --> 29:13.417
There are several archaeological sites
in this sector

29:13.585 --> 29:16.795
containing ruins
which are Romulan in origin.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.715
These are the locations that were
attacked by the mercenary vessel.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.800
Looks like they did
a pretty thorough job.

29:21.968 --> 29:25.053
Mm. The only sites not attacked
were on Calder lI,

29:25.221 --> 29:27.848
Yadalla Prime and Draken lV.

29:28.016 --> 29:32.394
LA FORGE: Yadalla and Draken are at
the far end of the sector, but Calder II,

29:32.562 --> 29:34.938
that's less than a day
from here at maximum warp.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.608
That would be their next likely target.

29:37.776 --> 29:41.153
According to this, there's
a Federation outpost at Calder II.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.655
But it is only a small science station.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.575
It has limited defensive capabilities.

29:46.743 --> 29:50.287
I do not believe it could withstand
an attack from the mercenary ship.

29:50.955 --> 29:54.958
Mr. Worf, send a message
to the Federation outpost on Calder II.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.586
Advise them that
if a ship matching the configuration

29:57.754 --> 29:59.421
of the mercenary vessel approaches,

29:59.589 --> 30:01.632
they should attempt to delay it
until our arrival.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.301
Ensign, take us out of orbit.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.179
Set a course for the Calder system.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.808
- Warp 9.

[DOOR OPENS

30:23.530 --> 30:25.447
We don't have much time.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.912
It's good to see you, Will.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.540
I didn't expect to meet you here.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.543
I was looking for the people
who killed you on the surface.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.920
A witness said
they saw you vaporized.

30:40.088 --> 30:44.299
These mercenaries use weapons
that can activate their transporter.

30:44.467 --> 30:48.178
It gives them the opportunity
to beam things away quickly,

30:48.346 --> 30:50.097
just by firing at them.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.640
That's what they did to me.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.141
I don't understand any of this.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.811
Who are these people? What are
you doing involved with them?

30:55.979 --> 30:59.147
The site that I wanted to study
had been raided.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.817
All of the artifacts had been stolen.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.862
The site had been practically
destroyed.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.239
Well, I wanted to find out
who was responsible.

31:08.324 --> 31:11.368
I tracked them to that bar
on Dessica Il.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.329
Well, I must have asked
too many questions.

31:14.497 --> 31:15.539
They captured me.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.709
They wanted to find out how much
I knew about their operation.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.377
And then you became part
of their crew?

31:21.170 --> 31:25.424
I convinced them I was a smuggler
and that my name was Galen.

31:26.175 --> 31:29.344
I offered to help them appraise
the artifacts that they had stolen.

31:29.512 --> 31:33.056
Will, these are not common thieves.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.225
They are stealing Romulan artifacts

31:35.393 --> 31:38.520
from archaeological sites
throughout this sector.

31:38.688 --> 31:41.064
Baran has me analyzing
each one of them

31:41.232 --> 31:43.901
for a particular particle signature.

31:44.068 --> 31:47.195
Will, they are looking
for a specific artifact.

31:47.947 --> 31:50.782
- Why?
- That's what we have to find out.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.826
Baran is the key.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.412
I think that he knows more
about what we're really looking for

31:55.580 --> 31:56.788
than anyone else on this ship.

31:56.956 --> 32:00.083
I want you to get close to him,
try and get his confidence.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.877
That's why you set up
the engine failure.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.254
Because you knew
that I'd be able to fix it.

32:04.422 --> 32:08.425
He also believes that you're
a less-than-perfect Starfleet officer.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.594
Will, I want you to play into that role.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.556
Baran and l--

32:14.724 --> 32:17.392
Well, he doesn't care
very much for me.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.686
But he has to tolerate me,

32:19.854 --> 32:24.358
because he needs my help
with these artifacts.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.652
But if you and I become enemies,

32:26.819 --> 32:29.571
then there's a better chance
of you and he becoming friends.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.241
All right. I'll do what I can.

[THUD]

33:29.215 --> 33:33.301
BARAN: Our next objective
should prove an interesting challenge.

33:33.469 --> 33:37.222
We're headed for the Sakethan
burial mounds on Calder lI.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.640
PICARD:
What?

33:39.100 --> 33:42.227
Calder II isn't just another
archaeological site, you know.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.812
It's a Federation outpost.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.397
I don't see that as a problem.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.816
PICARD:
It's defended by Starfleet.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.068
You don't think
they're just gonna stand by

33:50.236 --> 33:52.654
while we walk in there
and take whatever we want?

33:52.822 --> 33:55.365
I'm familiar with the tactical situation.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.326
- What are their defenses?
- Nothing to worry about.

33:58.494 --> 34:02.497
They have a type-four deflector shield
protecting the outpost and the ruins.

34:02.665 --> 34:05.792
They also have a minimum
of two phaser banks

34:05.960 --> 34:08.170
and possibly photon torpedoes.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.130
Is that enough to worry about?

34:10.298 --> 34:13.133
How do you know
so much about this outpost?

34:13.301 --> 34:16.344
Because l tried to smuggle
a Sakethan glyph stone out of there

34:16.512 --> 34:17.971
nearly two years ago.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.890
I barely got away in one piece.

34:20.099 --> 34:23.185
Our weapons are more than a match
for their defenses.

34:23.352 --> 34:28.315
I anticipate that we'll be able to destroy
the outpost within 1 5 minutes.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.985
Then we'll send in Tallera and
the landing party to secure the relics.

34:32.403 --> 34:33.695
Why don't we use Riker?

34:34.530 --> 34:38.450
A Starfleet commander could talk us
past the outpost security

34:38.618 --> 34:40.077
without raising their suspicions.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.037
Then when their shields go down,

34:42.205 --> 34:45.040
we could beam the artifacts up here
without ever leaving the ship.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.833
Why would Riker help us?

34:47.001 --> 34:48.794
Just because he's out of favor
with Starfleet,

34:48.961 --> 34:50.962
doesn't mean that he's ready
to betray them.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.883
If he doesn't help us,
we'll have to destroy the outpost

34:55.051 --> 34:56.343
and kill everyone on it.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.678
He's still a Starfleet officer.

34:58.846 --> 35:03.183
He won't wanna take innocent lives
if he can possibly prevent it.

35:06.729 --> 35:09.731
The last time we engaged Starfleet,
we lost a man.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.234
We can't afford any more casualties.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.362
If we can avoid a battle,
I think we should.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.409
All right, we'll try it.

35:22.203 --> 35:25.163
We'll be at Calder Il
within five hours.

a little slowly.

You can tell Baran if he wants
the analysis done faster,

Baran can kill you in an instant
if he activates his control device.

Heh. I doubt that he'll do that.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.835
If I knew what the point
of this mission were,

37:36.003 --> 37:38.088
why l was analyzing these relics.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.340
If Baran felt it were wise
to let the crew know that,

37:40.508 --> 37:42.008
I'm sure he would have.

37:46.389 --> 37:47.889
Do you know what all this is about?

37:49.600 --> 37:51.893
What Baran knows, I know.

Why are we risking our lives
taking these artifacts?

37:57.942 --> 38:01.736
- Who wants them?
- I see no reason to tell you anything.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.489
But you can rest assured,

38:04.657 --> 38:09.160
I don't necessarily share everything
I know with Baran either.

38:09.745 --> 38:15.417
This conversation, for example,
will stay between us.

38:15.584 --> 38:18.753
You can tell Baran
every word that I've said.

38:18.921 --> 38:21.881
He knows that I don't think much
of him as a leader.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.801
He's been in charge of this crew
for a long time.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.554
Baran wouldn't last five minutes
as captain

38:27.722 --> 38:29.723
if he didn't have that control device.

38:29.890 --> 38:33.101
The crew follow him
because they have no choice.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.938
Baran's power is based on
fear and intimidation.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.358
That almost sounds
like a prelude to mutiny.

38:40.526 --> 38:44.362
If someone were to challenge him,
the rest of the crew would follow.

38:45.531 --> 38:49.868
I was right.
You do like living dangerously.

38:55.249 --> 38:57.500
I like you, Galen.

38:58.210 --> 39:01.338
I can tolerate a lot
from someone like you.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.506
But only to a point.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.301

39:06.469 --> 39:08.887

you're getting in the way of that,

39:35.039 --> 39:38.416
but your outpost
is in imminent danger of attack.

on the surface for your protection.

39:43.172 --> 39:46.299

I'm sorry, sir, but the regulations
are very specific. l can't do it.

40:16.622 --> 40:19.666
I'm configuring the disruptors
to fire a phase-resonant pulse.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.669
If I can hit their shield generator
with precisely the right frequency,

40:22.837 --> 40:25.171
I should be able to take it out
with one shot.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.718
Their shields are down.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.556
The artifacts should be located
in several small structures

40:34.723 --> 40:36.683
arranged in staggered formations.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.059
I'm scanning.

40:40.563 --> 40:41.771
I think I've found them.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.982
Lock coordinates
and start bringing them up.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.908
There should be at least
two more down there.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.787
I've lost transporter lock.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.706
They've managed
to get their shields back up.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.459
I need those artifacts.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.587
Lock all disruptors on target.

41:05.754 --> 41:09.340
This time I want
that outpost destroyed.

41:15.639 --> 41:19.100
Direct hit on their aft deflectors.
They are undamaged.

41:19.268 --> 41:22.437

scan for Starfleet combadge signals.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.898
Is Commander Riker
aboard that ship?

41:25.065 --> 41:26.149
I can't tell, sir.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.276
Sensors are unable
to penetrate their hull.

41:28.944 --> 41:31.112
- Open a channel.
WORF: Open.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.781
This is the Federation starship
Enterprise.

41:33.949 --> 41:35.617
You are ordered to stand down.

41:36.118 --> 41:37.994
Drop your shields
and prepare to be boarded.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.371
You sent them a message.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.332
You told them where to find us.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.209
That's ridiculous.
When did l have a chance?

41:44.376 --> 41:45.793
This is set to kill.

41:45.961 --> 41:48.630
Order your ship to disengage.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.758
Activate visual.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.809
Commander, are you all right?

42:02.228 --> 42:03.728
Tell them.

42:07.566 --> 42:11.444
Mr. Data, withdraw the Enterprise.
That's an order.

42:12.738 --> 42:14.781
That is impossible, sir.

42:14.949 --> 42:17.992
The ship you are on
has violated a Federation outpost.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.619
It is my duty to stop it.

42:19.787 --> 42:23.164
I'm your commanding officer.
I'm giving you a direct order.

42:23.332 --> 42:24.332
Understood?

42:27.503 --> 42:29.712
Commander, if you could explain--

42:29.880 --> 42:34.551
I've never explained my orders before.
I'm not about to start now.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.014
I'm not about to let him
blow this ship into space.

42:40.182 --> 42:42.934
If I can set up a low-level comlink
between the two ships,

42:43.102 --> 42:44.477
I could use my command codes.

42:44.645 --> 42:45.979
I can deactivate the shields.

42:46.146 --> 42:47.647
Do it.

42:53.862 --> 42:55.071
[BEEPS]

42:55.239 --> 43:00.618
Sir, we are receiving some kind of
signal from the mercenary ship.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.746
These are Commander Riker's
access codes.

43:03.956 --> 43:06.040
He is attempting
to shut down our shields.

43:06.208 --> 43:07.208
That doesn't make sense.

43:07.376 --> 43:10.211
He knows those codes would've been
changed as soon as he was captured.

43:11.547 --> 43:13.715
That is correct, counselor.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.550
He does know.

43:16.176 --> 43:20.513
Mr. Worf, prepare to drop shields.

43:22.683 --> 43:25.685
Sir, we would be totally defenseless.

43:26.103 --> 43:27.312
I am aware of that.

43:27.479 --> 43:32.233
- Sir, as soon as they see us--
- Mr. Worf, that is an order.

43:35.237 --> 43:36.738
Aye, sir.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.992
[BEEPS]

43:41.160 --> 43:44.495
It worked. The shields are dropping.

43:45.205 --> 43:46.247
Fire.
