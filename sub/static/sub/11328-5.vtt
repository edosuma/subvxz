00:21.200 --> 00:23.000
I didn't want you to
have sex with anybody else.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.800
Grace, if you'll have me back
I swear I'll never have sex again.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.100
But you have to stop with
the drinking thing right now.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.700
Betty?
Yeah, Betty.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.900
Actually, she waved to
Grace's brother Tom.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.900
She seemed to
know him somehow.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.100
I want a commitment.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.100
I don't want you to have sex
with any other guys.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.400
Would you
mind watching John

00:41.500 --> 00:43.000
while I go to Italy
with Ben this summer?

00:44.700 --> 00:46.400
Let Ben go, Amy.
Let him go.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.900
The guy's been
really good to you.

00:48.400 --> 00:48.900
And to me.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.300
And if he wants to go away
for the summer, let him go.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.200
My fathering a child is
a bit of a medical miracle.

00:54.300 --> 00:55.000
Really?

00:55.300 --> 00:56.500
Will you marry me?

01:03.300 --> 01:05.700
Hello, my name
is Amy Juergens.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.700
What is your name?

01:07.500 --> 01:10.600
<i>Ciao. Mi chiamo
Amy Juergens.</i>

01:17.000 --> 01:18.100
Not my fault.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.600
You could have
said something.

01:20.700 --> 01:21.800
I don't speak Italian.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.400
Just learning a few phrases.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.100
Wow. So you're doing
so well in school

01:25.200 --> 01:26.800
and you also have time
to learn Italian?

01:27.100 --> 01:29.800
You're a new mother.
I'm impressed.Only--

01:30.200 --> 01:32.200
Only?
Only you're not going to Bologna.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.100
You know you're
not going, right?

01:34.300 --> 01:35.600
Yes, I am going.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.700
No, you're not.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.600
Look, Amy, you need
to face facts.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.700
Young men of a certain age
do not go abroad

01:41.800 --> 01:43.900
with a celibate girlfriend
and baby in tow.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.200
Well, Ben asked me to go,
and John too.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.900
Why would he ask us if
he didn't want us to go?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.700
So that he wouldn't have to carry around
his guilt in a backpack all summer.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.000
I don't care why, okay?

01:52.100 --> 01:53.400
He knew you wouldn't
be able to go.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.800
That's why he asked you.

01:54.900 --> 01:56.500
And why wouldn't I
be able to go?

01:56.600 --> 01:58.100
Because you love him
and you're happy

01:58.200 --> 02:00.200
that he can get away
for the summer,even though you can't.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.300
But I can.
I can if I want to.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.500
Just let the guy
sow his wild oats.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.400
I'm not going to Bologna
because I'm afraid

02:06.500 --> 02:08.300
Ben will do something
I don't want him to do.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.699
I'm going because it's
what's best for my son.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.100
Every day
is an opportunity

02:12.200 --> 02:13.500
to be exposed
to other cultures.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.600
I want John to be
exposed to other cultures.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.500
We were never exposed
to other cultures.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.500
Mom and Dad never
took us to Europe or Asia

02:20.600 --> 02:22.700
or Africa
or any place like that.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.700
They never even thought about
exposing us to other cultures.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.400
Well, that misguided trip
to the Grand Canyon

02:27.500 --> 02:29.500
was more than enough
family travel time for me.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.800
I just want my son to be
a citizen of the world.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.800
He's not even going to know
what part of the world he's in.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.400
You would know.
Yes, I would know if I were in Italy.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.100
You could go, too.
Yeah, Ben would love that.

02:39.300 --> 02:40.300
I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.200
I'm sure he would.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.800
Just like I'm sure
he would mind

02:42.900 --> 02:45.600
if you and John actually
join him on his journey to manhood.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.400
He's not going
to anyplace like that.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.300
I think he is.
Are you here for a reason?

02:49.400 --> 02:51.400
Yeah. Dad wanted me
to ask you something.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.200
Do you know Mom's engaged,
or don't you?

02:55.200 --> 02:57.300
Okay, headphones off.
You're on duty now.

02:58.100 --> 02:58.800
Hi, Ash.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.200
Good morning.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.100
I'll just be going now.
I got what I came for.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.200
What'd she come for?

03:08.600 --> 03:09.900
You're engaged?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.000
When did you
get engaged?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.800
I thought you were making
eggs for the two of us.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.800
You can't be engaged.
You're not divorced.

03:16.900 --> 03:20.000
No, I can't be married,
I'm not divorced.I can be engaged.

03:20.100 --> 03:20.900
Are you?

03:21.400 --> 03:22.700
No, but I'm
thinking about it.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.300
I could think a lot more clearly
if I had some eggs.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.900
I really wanted
some eggs.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.600
You want me to make you eggs
and yet you didn't even tell me?

03:29.700 --> 03:32.000
Well, I was going to
tell you. I just haven't yet.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.600
I figured I would tell you
after I had some eggs.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.200
I have a really long day
ahead of me.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.600
We're working on a
really big project, David and me.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.000
Oh, come on. Don't make a
big deal out of it.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.500
It's not even official yet.

03:45.700 --> 03:49.100
So I guess you'll let me know
when it's official.I guess, yeah.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.300
You know, if David's going to
be around here all the time,

03:52.500 --> 03:53.800
I'm just going to get
in the way here.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.700
John and me.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.800
That's why I'm going to go
to Bologna this summer with Ben.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.300
And I'm taking
John with me.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.100
I'm an adult now.
I have a child.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.500
I have to do
what I have to do.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.600
Yeah, well, Amy, you have to
stay here for the summer

04:05.700 --> 04:07.000
and work
and take care of John.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.100
I don't have to.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.600
Yeah, you do have to.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.300
What are you going
to do this summer?

04:11.400 --> 04:12.800
David and I are
still discussing it.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.899
I guess you'll let me know
when you officially decided.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.200
I knew she didn't tell her.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.300
Maybe she's not engaged.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.100
I saw him put the ring
on her finger a week ago

04:55.200 --> 04:56.700
and he's been over there
every night since then.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.900
No, those two are
up to something.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.100
Maybe she said no.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.000
And I think the question
at this point is

05:01.300 --> 05:02.300
are you up to something?

05:02.400 --> 05:03.900
What would I be up to?
No, it's definitely them.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.100
What are they up to?

05:05.200 --> 05:07.900
Well, they're having a baby,
or they think they are.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.600
Maybe she thinks
it's not David's.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.700
You know, and maybe that's
why she's not wearing

05:11.800 --> 05:13.600
that big diamond ring
you think you saw.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.400
I did see it.
It was huge.

05:16.000 --> 05:16.800
Why would she hide it?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.800
Because she hasn't decided
if she's marrying him,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.300
no matter whose baby it is.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.800
Maybe my vasectomy
came undone.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.100
Or maybe you lied.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.600
That'd be a pretty big lie.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.300
I don't even know if I'm
even capable of telling a lie like that.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.900
And if I were, I don't know
what I would do about it.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.500
I know. We could go
with Amy to Italy.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.500
We could summer in Bologna.
It might be good to get away.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.100
Yeah, it might, but A, we don't
use "summer" as a verb in this family

05:39.200 --> 05:40.800
and 2, people don't go
to Bologna to get away.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.400
They go there
for something else entirely.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.600
I know what they
go there for.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.000
How do you know?
Amy.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.300
How does she know?
I don't know,

05:46.400 --> 05:48.800
but there are lots of other
things to do in Italy besides...

05:50.000 --> 05:51.100
sex things.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.600
Lot of those Vespas
over there.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
You like Vespas, don't you?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.200
Yeah, I like Vespas,
but believe me,

05:56.300 --> 05:58.300
everyone riding a Vespa
in Italy either just had sex

05:58.400 --> 05:59.400
or is about to have sex.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.900
That's why they
drive so crazy.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.600
No, we can't just take off
and go over there. What about the dog?

06:04.700 --> 06:05.700
We don't have a dog.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.400
We can get a dog
when we get back.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.200
I don't think Amy
really is going, is she?

06:09.600 --> 06:10.800
She can't take John
to Italy.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.000
Well, that's what she's
planning to do.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.800
Well, she can't.
We could.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.600
The dollar isn't worth
a peso in Europe.

06:15.700 --> 06:16.500
I don't want
to go over there.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.800
Well, it's better
than just waiting here

06:17.900 --> 06:20.100
for Mom to find out that you
lied about the vasectomy.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.900
I didn't say I lied, did I?
Did you?

06:22.300 --> 06:23.100
It doesn't matter.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.100
Still could be
David's baby.

06:25.700 --> 06:26.700
And it probably is.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.700
Or not.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.100
Good morning.

06:34.700 --> 06:35.800
I just wanted you to know

06:35.900 --> 06:38.400
that if you want breakfast,
I can make it for you,

06:38.500 --> 06:40.400
since your dad
left for work early today.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.100
I had breakfast
earlier, Betty. Sorry.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.200
Oh.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.300
I have to get to school
early this morning,

06:46.500 --> 06:48.600
get to the library,
return these books on Italy.

06:48.900 --> 06:49.700
Right.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.600
Oh, heck, Benjamin,

06:54.500 --> 06:57.200
I-- I usually just
slip out the back door

06:57.300 --> 06:58.600
before you come downstairs,

06:59.600 --> 07:02.500
but, well, today I
decided to be brave,

07:02.800 --> 07:04.600
and I marched upstairs

07:05.700 --> 07:09.200
and I'm saying "Hello,
stepson, let's be friends."

07:09.400 --> 07:12.100
And I appreciate
your bravery,

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
but research and several
mainstream movies

07:17.100 --> 07:20.500
have shown that the relationship
between stepmother and stepson

07:20.600 --> 07:22.200
develops slowly
over time.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.000
Lots of time.

07:24.100 --> 07:27.000
Honey, there's nothing
slow about me.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.800
I mean, even I know that.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.900
So.
So.

07:34.700 --> 07:38.700
I hear you're going to go to
Italy with Amy and the baby this summer.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.000
Is that really the latest?

07:41.200 --> 07:45.000
Truthfully, I've gotten myself
into a bit of a situation about that.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.200
I love Amy,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.300
but I really want
to go to Bologna alone.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.300
And I'm going for work,
I'm not going for--

07:52.600 --> 07:53.900
But I just want to go.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.900
Well, I know you're
not going for sex,

07:56.300 --> 08:00.200
but if you were, you might want
to get yourself some new condoms.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.300
'Cause a lot of yours
have expired,

08:02.400 --> 08:06.100
and some of them
have been discontinued for safety reasons.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.100
That's good to know.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.500
What time do you
have to be in court?

08:10.600 --> 08:13.500
Oh, um, it just depends.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.900
They can't start without me.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.100
All right, well,
have a nice day.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.000
Thanks.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.800
Good morning.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.000
I didn't know
you were back.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.100
Yeah,
I got the red-eye.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.700
You were sleeping
when I got home.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.600
Uh, you probably didn't get
to spend any time with Ruben,

08:37.799 --> 08:39.799
especially since he has
to be at work so early.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.400
Why don't you two
go out tonight?

08:42.600 --> 08:43.700
You know, someplace nice.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.000
So you can see Ricky?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.900
Yes, and so you
can go out with Ruben.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.300
I'm really tired.
I've been flying a lot lately

08:50.300 --> 08:51.600
and I'm not feeling well.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.400
I just want
some time to myself.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.200
Yeah, well, I want
some time to myself.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.700
With Ricky, without you
or Ruben three feet away.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.600
When are we going to
move to a real house,

09:00.700 --> 09:02.200
where I can have
some privacy again?

09:02.300 --> 09:03.900
When we can find one.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.200
We're trying to find one
in your school district,

09:06.300 --> 09:08.200
but so far,
we haven't seen anything.

09:08.300 --> 09:12.600
Wait. Did you say
that you were tired and not feeling well?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.200
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.000
You're not...

09:16.700 --> 09:18.400
Oh, no. You and Ruben,
you're not...

09:18.500 --> 09:22.900
Oh, no. No, no, God, no,
Adrian, no, don't be ridiculous.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.700
You're sure?
I'm sure.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.500
It's not that ridiculous.
Amy's mother's having a baby.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.200
Really?

09:29.100 --> 09:30.200
Anne and George?

09:30.400 --> 09:31.900
Anne and somebody.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.900
It's a very sound decision.
I disagree.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.100
I thought you might.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.300
You're not even 17 yet.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.800
I will be this summer.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.700
So I'm going to get
kicked out of the system the next year anyway.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.300
I'd rather leave
because I want to leave

09:46.400 --> 09:47.700
rather than get pushed out.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.200
You may get pushed
out of the system,

09:50.300 --> 09:53.000
but no one is pushing
you out of here.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.400
And I'm not so sure
this isn't just an excuse.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.000
Do you know what's involved

09:58.100 --> 10:00.100
in getting legally emancipated

10:00.200 --> 10:01.400
and becoming an adult?

10:01.500 --> 10:02.800
Kind of. Not entirely.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.500
But you've taken care
of me long enough.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.100
It's time for me to move out
and get a place of my own

10:07.200 --> 10:08.600
and let the next Ricky
get your help.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.000
I think you
still need our help.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.000
I'll probably always
need your help.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.600
But I think we all know
I grew up years ago.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I had to.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.400
And now I'm a father.

10:18.600 --> 10:22.100
And I have a job.
I can do this. I'm ready.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.600
You're a very responsible
young man. Very proud of you.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.600
Made a lot of progress
this year.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.600
There's still a lot
of progress to be made,

10:28.700 --> 10:31.500
and you can be just as proud
of him if he's still here.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.200
What's your real reason
for moving out?

10:35.500 --> 10:38.400
Is it so you can
have sex any time you want?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.900
Well, I would like some privacy
for those times when I want to have sex.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.000
You know I have sex.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.300
I know. And I don't like it.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.000
But we know
it's a fact of life,

10:48.100 --> 10:49.800
and we can't ignore it.

10:50.200 --> 10:54.800
Why don't you give up
having sex for a while

10:54.900 --> 10:56.300
and see how that goes?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.200
That is an option.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.200
A cheaper option than moving out of
the house so you can have sex.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.200
It's not just to have sex,
I swear.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.400
I want some time alone
for myself, too.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.800
It's healthy to be
alone sometimes.

11:09.200 --> 11:09.900
I'm never alone.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.400
I love you both, and I love that
you take care of all the kids

11:13.500 --> 11:15.100
who usually are
all around here.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.800
But I have no time alone.

11:17.100 --> 11:19.100
Not here, not at school,
not at work.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.700
Not at Amy's.
It's never just me.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.500
Or just me and Amy and John.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.900
And it's just
going to get worse.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.300
Her mom's having a baby.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.100
What? Whose baby?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.100
I don't know. I guess
it's the boyfriend's baby.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.900
What are these people putting
in their coffee over there?

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
They are the most fertile,
irresponsible bunch of--

11:43.500 --> 11:45.200
Well, she couldn't
have planned it.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.700
What recently divorced woman
would have a baby

11:48.800 --> 11:51.800
when her 15-year-old daughter
just had--

11:53.000 --> 11:54.400
The point is I need to move

12:07.500 --> 12:09.700
I'm going to be so happy
when school's over.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.000
It's so hard to concentrate
on my classes right now.

12:12.100 --> 12:12.900
Uh-hmm.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.600
Tom, I have been
walking around with a secret all week

12:16.700 --> 12:17.600
and I just have to
tell somebody.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.000
Sex again?
No, I'm never having sex again.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.300
Even when Jack and I are
married, I may adopt.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.100
Maybe Mom will be
in heaven by then,

12:25.200 --> 12:27.700
and you'll have
all the sex you want.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.100
Tom!
Huh?

12:30.200 --> 12:31.700
That is a terrible
thing to say.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.600
What?
I'm trying to tell
you a story.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.800
Do you heard of "a long story short"?
You know what that means.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.900
Okay. You know last week,
when I left school when I was upset?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.200
And I was walking home
'cause it was my first day back

12:43.300 --> 12:45.500
and, you know, Mom
had tried to get me to talk to someone?

12:45.600 --> 12:47.300
Short. Not long.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.200
Mr. Juergens told me that he
lied about his vasectomy,

12:50.300 --> 12:51.400
and now Amy's mother is pregnant

12:51.500 --> 12:53.400
and it might be his
and not her boyfriend's.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.100
Why are you laughing?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.800
It's not funny.
It's very serious.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.000
"Doonesbury."

12:59.300 --> 13:01.600
No. It's funny.
It's a comic strip.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.500
Why are you reading
"Doonesbury"

13:02.600 --> 13:04.200
when I'm trying to tell you
about Mr. Juergens?

13:04.700 --> 13:09.000
Why would you tell me
about Mr. Juergens

13:09.100 --> 13:12.100
when I'm trying
to read "Doonesbury"?

13:12.300 --> 13:14.200
Wait. Is that--

13:15.600 --> 13:17.200
Are you wearing
Dad's robe?

13:18.200 --> 13:19.600
You are. You're
wearing Dad's robe.

13:19.700 --> 13:20.500
Take that off.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.100
Take that off.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.800
Tom. Tom.
Mom, help.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.200
Help me.
Grace, stop, Grace, stop.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.000
He's wearing Dad's robe.
It's okay.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.500
No, it's not okay.
He wanted it.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.500
I gave it to him.
Why would you do that?

13:31.700 --> 13:33.100
Grace. Is that what you do
when I'm at school?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.700
You just give away
Dad's stuff to people?

13:34.800 --> 13:36.100
Honey, it's just a robe.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.200
And his watch.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.900
When you get home
from school today,

13:40.000 --> 13:41.200
we can go through
your dad's things

13:41.300 --> 13:42.400
and find
something you want.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.000
I want his robe
and his watch

13:44.100 --> 13:45.100
and everything else
that's his.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.000
I don't want anybody else
to have any of his stuff.

13:47.100 --> 13:47.700
Grace.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.400
Can we tell her

13:52.800 --> 13:55.000
we gave Dad's sport coat
to Jack?

13:55.100 --> 13:57.900
No, we can't tell her we gave
Dad's sport coat to Jack.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.300
We've got to get it
back from Jack.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.600
I don't want to
upset her more.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.900
But you've been wearing
that robe all week.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.600
She must be upset
about something else.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.300
Oh, yeah.

14:08.900 --> 14:14.000
George Juergens lied
about his surgery.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.900
George Juergens lied
about what surgery?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.400
Snip snip.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.800
I meant no snip,
no snip.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.200
Is Anne pregnant
with his baby?

14:25.700 --> 14:28.200
I thought she was pregnant
with her boyfriend's baby.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.900
<i>How are you, chica?
You okay?</i>

14:44.600 --> 14:45.400
Am I okay?

14:46.300 --> 14:48.200
Obviously I'm not, otherwise
you wouldn't be asking me that.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.900
I hate that everyone
just keeps asking me that.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.700
I'm sorry. You're right. I hate it
when people ask me that, too.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.300
So...what's up?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.300
Tom was wearing my dad's
robe this morning.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.300
Oh, that's nice.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.600
No, it's not nice.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.900
It's...creepy?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.400
No, it's not creepy,
it's just...

15:08.100 --> 15:09.100
that's my dad's robe.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.200
I just don't like that he's
taking my dad's things.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.000
My mom is giving him my dad's things.
Yeah.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.700
On the other hand,
it's just a robe.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.900
And his watch.
Did you want the watch?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.900
I just want all his watches
to stay where they are.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.600
Is your mom going to
give you one of them?

15:20.700 --> 15:22.300
That's not the point.
The point is--

15:23.800 --> 15:25.500
I just feel
overwhelmed right now.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.000
I just want school
to be over.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.700
All I can think about
is sex and death.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.400
And death and sex.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.500
Well, it's normal, Grace.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.200
Is it?
Yeah.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.000
Especially after you've been through
what you've just been through.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.700
Yeah, I guess.

15:40.700 --> 15:41.900
I just don't understand

15:42.200 --> 15:44.500
why God just puts us here
to have sex and then die.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.400
Is everybody
so screwed up sexually?

15:47.500 --> 15:48.700
Oh, yeah.

15:49.100 --> 15:50.500
Everyone.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.500
Some more than others,
of course.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.200
But that's why
I feel so blessed--

15:54.300 --> 15:56.300
cause I am not that screwed up.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.200
Although I'm going to be

15:58.300 --> 16:00.200
if I don't have some
alone time with Ricky.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.500
Adrian, you know I think
sex before marriage is wrong.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.900
And you know I don't think
sex before marriage is wrong.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.800
Well, not for me.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.000
Look, if I don't
have sex with Ricky soon,

16:10.100 --> 16:11.800
he's going to have sex
with someone else.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.200
Even though he
doesn't want me to.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.500
It's wrong for everyone.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.500
Everyone who's not married.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.800
And sometimes it's even
wrong when you're married.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.000
Or if you're married
but you're about to get divorced.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.700
Who are you talking about?

16:27.300 --> 16:28.600
Wait, are you talking
about Amy's mother?

16:28.700 --> 16:30.300
You know she's
pregnant, right?

16:30.400 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, Ricky told me.
It's all over school.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.300
She and her boyfriend
are having a baby.

16:36.500 --> 16:40.400
Who?
Her husband,or soon-to-be ex-husband.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.300
No. George?

16:42.400 --> 16:43.800
Yeah. It might be true.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
He lied about having
a vasectomy.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.000
Wait. How do you know?

16:47.100 --> 16:48.200
He told me.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And now
I told you and Tom.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.100
I can't tell you
how much better I feel.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.200
He moved next door
to Amy, right? Yeah.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.700
Do you think he might move back
in with Amy and her mother?

16:57.900 --> 17:01.000
I mean, if he's the father.
I don't know. Why?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.400
Cause my parents need a house

17:02.500 --> 17:04.099
hey can't find one in the school district.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.800
Adrian, you can't tell anyone anything
I told you about Mr. Juergens.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.000
He doesn't even know for sure
if he's the father.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.599
And I'm the only person
he told.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.500
Did you tell anyone else
besides Tom?

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
That's what I heard.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.099
How could you hear something
before I heard it?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.700
Jason told me.
Jason told you before he told me.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.500
Yeah.
Why?

17:23.599 --> 17:26.300
I don't know. He thinks
you can't keep a secret.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.300
Oh, I can't keep a secret.
You can't keep a secret.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.600
You tell me everything.

17:29.900 --> 17:32.800
Yeah, but the only person I
ever tell anything to is you.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.800
I don't tell other people.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.000
Well, where do you think
Jason heard it?

17:37.100 --> 17:38.900
Where else?
The locker room.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.200
Well, who in the locker room
would know something like that?

17:42.200 --> 17:43.700
Jack.
Jack?

17:44.300 --> 17:47.100
Please. Okay.
Where would Jack hear something

17:47.200 --> 17:49.700
like Mr. Juergens lied
about his vasectomy?

17:49.800 --> 17:52.200
She thinks it's her boyfriend's
and maybe it is her boyfriend's.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.300
So maybe Mr. Juergens
wouldn't be moving back in.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.900
But maybe
he'd be moving away.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.600
He's not going to want
to live next door

17:57.700 --> 18:00.500
to his ex-wife and her boyfriend
when they have a new baby, is he?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.300
I don't know.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.500
All I know
is that he lied.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.100
Maybe it's twins.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.900
Maybe one is
Mr. Juergens' baby,

18:07.000 --> 18:08.700
and the other one is
the boyfriend's baby.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.300
Madison, she's not
having kittens.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.600
What?
He lied.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.000
Who said that?

18:19.300 --> 18:19.900
Jack.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.200
How would Jack know?

18:23.500 --> 18:24.600
How would Grace know?

18:24.700 --> 18:25.900
Mr. Juergens
told her.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.100
Please. Mr. Juergens
told Grace Bowman

18:28.200 --> 18:29.700
that he lied
about a vasectomy?

18:29.800 --> 18:30.600
Why would he do that?

18:30.700 --> 18:33.400
I don't know, but 500,000
men a year in the US alone

18:33.800 --> 18:34.900
get a vasectomy.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.400
Lucky you're going to Italy for the summer
and not staying here, huh?

18:37.600 --> 18:39.000
What is the logic, Henry?

18:39.100 --> 18:41.000
I wasn't going to Italy
to get a vasectomy.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.900
No, no.You're going for
quite a different reason.

18:43.700 --> 18:44.600
We think I should go.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.600
To Bologna? With me
and Amy and John?

18:46.700 --> 18:47.600
What? They're not
going to go.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.100
I don't know.
I asked her.

18:49.200 --> 18:49.800
Why?

18:50.900 --> 18:51.600
Because--

18:51.700 --> 18:54.500
But I thought--
We thought, Alice and I,

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
that you could take me.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.700
As a kind of summer school,
you know?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.600
Trained in Bologna.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.600
Okay, this is getting way,
way, way out of control.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.000
I'm going to Bologna to work
at my uncle's hotel.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.300
I'm sure Amy could stay
wherever he's putting me up,

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
if I have to take her.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.200
But I can't take
you too, Henry.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.000
If you have to
take me?

19:13.400 --> 19:14.800
You do have to take me.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.300
Okay.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.800
I am just getting deeper
and deeper into this.

19:25.000 --> 19:25.700
Ben.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.000
I don't care if you want me
to go or not at this point.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.700
I just need to get out
of that room with the baby.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.800
I can't take it.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.200
And this morning
I made my stand.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.800
I told my mother
that I am an adult

19:41.900 --> 19:44.100
and I will be leaving
for the summer with John.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.100
I'm sorry, Amy.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.300
I didn't mean
if I have to take you.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.600
What'd you mean?
I want you to come with me to Italy. But--

19:51.800 --> 19:53.200
But he'd rather go alone.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.400
And you can't just take John
and go to Italy or out of the country

19:56.500 --> 19:58.700
without asking me.
Yes, I can.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
And I thought
you didn't care.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.800
If this is going
to get ugly--

20:01.900 --> 20:02.600
Yeah, it might.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.500
And I thought
you didn't care.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.400
- If this is going to get ugly--
- Yeah, it might.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.300
- I care.
- Since when?

20:06.500 --> 20:08.200
You look annoyed every
time you come over.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.400
Look, I love my son.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.500
I may not love anyone else,
but I love him.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.600
And I want to see him.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.800
And I want to start seeing him by
myself or with my family and friends.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.800
Not just your family and friends.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.600
So I'm getting
my own place this summer,

20:19.700 --> 20:21.400
and I'm going to want to take
him out of the house sometime.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.300
I'm taking him to Italy this summer.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.600
Don't be ridiculous, Amy.You don't
even have a passport,and neither does he.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.400
And even if you did,
even if he did,

20:28.600 --> 20:29.700
who's going to pay
for the tickets?

20:29.900 --> 20:32.300
And where are you gonna live and how are
you gonna take care of yourself and him?

20:32.400 --> 20:33.900
Ben will take care
of all of that.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.100
You're getting your own
place? Your own apartment?

20:36.300 --> 20:37.000
Yeah.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.700
You really want to leave
me here for the summer

20:39.700 --> 20:42.800
when Ricky's getting
his own apartment?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.800
I wonder what they're talking about.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.400
Don't say anything to Ricky
about Mr. Juergens.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.900
He might tell Amy.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.100
He might tell Amy.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.300
Hmm? No, I won't.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.600
I won't.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.900
She's making me nuts.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.800
She can't just take off with John.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.200
- It's just for the summer.
- It's not going to happen.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.700
He's not going away for the
summer. I could keep him.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.200
- How?
- How?

21:22.400 --> 21:25.700
Just like Amy.Drop him off at daycare,
pick him up and take him home.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.700
- And where are you going to live?
- I don't know.I'll find something.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.500
I gotta figure out
my money first.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.400
You're kind of young to live
by yourself, aren't you?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.800
No, I'm not.I've been 40 since I was 4.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.200
And you stay alone all the time.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.700
Or you used to.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.500
Don't worry. I'm not getting my
own apartment just so I can get laid.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.400
You don't need
an apartment for that.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.200
You can come over to our house...

21:46.400 --> 21:47.500
when we get a house.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.200
Your parents are never going to find a house.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.000
They might have found something.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.800
Well, good for them.
I still want my own place.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.300
All right.I can't wait.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.800
That'll be fun.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.300
I'd really like
to see him, you know?

22:01.500 --> 22:04.500
- John. I'd like to see you with him.
- You will.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.900
You will see me with him, because
she's not taking him anywhere.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.300
Oh, cut her some slack, Ricky.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.400
Amy's young,and she's overwhelmed.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.900
She has a baby to
take care of and school,

22:14.100 --> 22:17.500
and then everything going on with
her mom and the pregnancy.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.400
Yeah, I guess you're right.

22:19.600 --> 22:23.200
I know she's still adjusting to being
a mom and she'd like to get away,

22:23.400 --> 22:24.800
but she must know that she can't.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.500
She must. I'm even
surprised she'd want to

22:27.500 --> 22:29.500
considering her parents
might get back together.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.600
I don't think her parents
are getting back together

22:31.600 --> 22:33.600
when her mother's having
a baby with her boyfriend.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.700
I heard it might not
be the boyfriend's.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.600
I heard it might be her dad's.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.000
Yeah?

22:40.900 --> 22:42.100
I heard...

22:44.600 --> 22:47.500
Thank you. Okay.
Talk to you later.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.400
Just checking on John.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.400
- Oh, is he okay?
- Yeah, he's okay.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.800
I just like to call in to the nursery
at lunchtime and make sure he's okay.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.900
- And he is?
- Yep.

23:00.900 --> 23:01.900
What?

23:02.200 --> 23:03.600
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.100
- Something.
- So how's your mom?

23:06.300 --> 23:08.000
How's my mom?

23:08.300 --> 23:11.700
uh my mom is feeling
very out of control,

23:11.800 --> 23:13.900
so she is trying to control me.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.900
But that's just how my mom is.

23:16.100 --> 23:19.300
She says I'm not going to Italy
for the summer,but I say I'm going.

23:19.500 --> 23:23.200
I'm not just going to stay at home
watching her and her boyfriend all summer.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.300
- I still can't believe they're having a baby.
- Yeah.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

23:28.600 --> 23:31.600
Isn't it weird to have another man
living in the house with your mom?

23:31.800 --> 23:34.400
- Madison!
- I don't care if she asks me that.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.400
Um, yeah, it is weird.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.700
- Do you like David?
- He's okay.

23:38.900 --> 23:41.200
I just wish she had
dated around a little more.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.500
She went straight
from my dad to David.

23:43.700 --> 23:46.700
She's almost 40 years old,
and she's dated two guys.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.400
It's pathetic.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.400
Not that David's
not a nice guy.

23:51.600 --> 23:55.600
- He's rich and he's smart and all that.
- But he's not your dad.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.800
It's too bad it's not
your dad's baby.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.800
My dad can't have any more
children.He got a vasectomy.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.000
What?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.500
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.900
- What do you know?
- How would we know

24:09.900 --> 24:12.400
anything about your dad's vasectomy?

24:12.600 --> 24:14.800
Yeah. I mean, come on.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.400
You're right.
I am being ridiculous.

24:18.900 --> 24:22.400
How would anyone know anything
about my dad's vasectomy?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.800
I have lost my mind.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.700
I told you I've been locked up
with a baby for too long.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.200
Yeah, well, good luck with
that.I'll see you around.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.900
Bye.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.100
Hi.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.200
Oh. Sit down.
I'm glad you're here.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.400
I feel like people
are staring at me.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
I'm sorry.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.400
I mean,I know they mean well,but

24:46.600 --> 24:49.600
I hate this.They're, like,
watching meto see how I am.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.600
I mean, I'm terrible.

24:53.400 --> 24:57.300
I just have moments where I feel so sad
I can hardly keep from bursting into tears.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.800
And then the next moment,I can't
get you and me out of my mind--

25:00.000 --> 25:01.600
you and me and what we did and...

25:01.800 --> 25:04.500
I just feel so guilty,
and I hate myself.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.900
Sometimes I just get
angry--really angry.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.100
My emotions are all over the place.

25:10.700 --> 25:13.400
I don't want to say I know
because I don't know.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.300
I was much younger when
my dad died.But, uh,

25:16.600 --> 25:18.900
I remember how I
would go from weeping

25:19.100 --> 25:22.500
to forgetting to remembering
to being screaming angry--

25:22.700 --> 25:25.800
just hitting my bed
with a baseball bat.

25:26.300 --> 25:27.300
That helps.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.300
If you want,
I'll bring you a bat.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.200
Yeah. Maybe I will.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.300
I'm so upset with Tom right now.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.900
And my mom. She gave
Tommy my dad's robe

25:36.100 --> 25:38.000
- and his watch.
- Hmm.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.100
Yeah,I got up this morning,I
came down to the breakfast table,

25:40.100 --> 25:42.700
and Tom was just sitting
there wearing my dad's robe.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.100
Can you believe that?

25:44.500 --> 25:47.500
Uh, no.
But

25:47.900 --> 25:50.200
But maybe it made Tom feel
good to be wearing his robe.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.200
And his watch.
He had his watch, too.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.100
Well, it's a man's watch.
You don't want his watch,do you?

25:55.200 --> 25:58.500
No, but I don't want other
people to have his things, Jack.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.200
I mean, he just died.
It's only been a few weeks.

26:01.400 --> 26:05.300
I know. Grace, I know,
and I'm sorry.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.300
Hi.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.700
Are you okay, Grace?

26:12.500 --> 26:13.900
Yeah. Thank you.

26:14.300 --> 26:17.300
Although every time somebody
asks me that,I feel like I'm not.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.100
Oh, right. I forgot.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.800
I lost my mom, you know.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.400
Oh,yeah.I knew that.I forgot.

26:25.600 --> 26:29.100
Me, too.
I'm so sorry.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.400
Did you want to sit down?

26:33.600 --> 26:36.600
Oh, it's okay.I'll
catch up with you later.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.100
It's terrible, isn't it?

26:45.300 --> 26:47.600
Yeah, it's the worst.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.500
You don't really understand it
until you've gone through it.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.000
And I've been through it.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.700
Oh, hi.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.500
I was wondering where you were.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.400
So you're not angry with me
for saying what I said about--

27:05.500 --> 27:07.400
About having to take me to Italy?

27:07.500 --> 27:10.100
No. As long as you take me.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.700
Benjamin, hi.
You forgot your lunch.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.700
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi, Betty.

27:16.900 --> 27:19.100
Yeah, your dad told me
I could bring it to you.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.100
And then the office said
I could leave it with them,

27:22.200 --> 27:24.100
but I thought I would
just come by and say hi.

27:24.300 --> 27:27.300
Well, that's very kind of you.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.300
Uh, all right.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.500
- I guess I'd better be going.
- Uh, thanks again for this.

27:38.600 --> 27:42.000
Oh, sure. Anytime.
Bye-bye, Amy.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.300
What is wrong with her parents?

27:50.500 --> 27:53.300
- What do you mean?
- Ben, look at her.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.800
- She's a hooker.She's gotta be a hooker.
- She doesn't have to be a hooker.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.300
She's not a hooker.
I like Betty.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.000
- Whatever.
- Whatever?What does that mean?

28:02.100 --> 28:05.600
It means you can like her all you
want,but she looks like a hooker.

28:05.700 --> 28:08.000
She knows the Bowmans.Would
the Bowmans know a hooker?

28:08.200 --> 28:09.700
How do you know
she knows the Bowmans?

28:09.800 --> 28:11.700
She just waved to Grace.
Grace just waved to her.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.100
- That doesn't mean she's not a hooker.
- My dad is not marrying a hooker.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.300
I don't care if your dad
is marrying a hooker.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.500
But he's not.

28:18.700 --> 28:22.500
And even if he were,
?????????

28:33.300 --> 28:34.600
Do you think she's a hooker?

28:34.800 --> 28:38.100
I don't know.How would I know?I don't
have anything to do with hookers.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.600
She seems to know Grace and Tom.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.300
I mean, why would Grace
and Tom know a hooker?

28:41.400 --> 28:43.500
I don't know. Why you asking
me all this stuff? Ask her.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.300
- Grace?
- No. Betty.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.900
Go directly to the source.You want to know
something about someone,go straight to them.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.800
I can't just walk up to Betty and say,
"Hi, how are you?Are you a hooker?"

28:52.000 --> 28:52.900
Well, not like that.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.800
- How?
- I don't know, Ben.You'll figure it out.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.100
I've got other stuff on my mind.
I've got to go talk to Bunny.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.100
You want a raise,don't you?

29:12.300 --> 29:13.800
Oh, no,I don't want a raise.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.800
Fine. I'm not
going to give you one.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
I just want permission from you to talk to
Mr. Boykewich about working more hours.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.200
I know.I know I work for you.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.700
But he's the one who gave me the job,
and I just feel I have to ask him.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.900
I just want to work more hours
so I can make more money.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.800
So if it's okay with you,I'd
like to talk to Mr. Boykewich

29:32.900 --> 29:35.300
just because, like I said,
he gave me the job.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.900
All right.He's coming
down here at closing time.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.500
- Thanks.
- I like your style, kid.

29:40.700 --> 29:43.000
- I don't.
- What do you mean?

29:43.100 --> 29:46.700
I'm actually jealous that Amy would
go to Italy with our son with Ben.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.300
So he's "our son" now,
not "my son"?

29:49.500 --> 29:50.700
Did I say that?

29:58.700 --> 30:02.000
Before you start talking to Dad--Before
he even gets intothe house, get over here.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.600
- Who is this?
- Get over here!

30:06.900 --> 30:08.100
Hey, where you going?

30:08.500 --> 30:11.400
Next door.Some sort of emergency that
Amy doesn't want you there for.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.600
Go over there.Find out why she
didn't speak to me all the way home.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.700
You were sitting next to her in the car.
Why didn't you ask her what was wrong?

30:16.800 --> 30:18.800
- Go! Go!
- You owe me.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.800
Yeah, yeah. Go!

30:25.200 --> 30:27.700
- What's the emergency?
-You know what everyone is saying at school?

30:27.900 --> 30:29.500
They're saying that Dad
lied about his vasectomy,

30:29.500 --> 30:31.300
which means he could
be the father of the baby.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.700
- Not David, Dad.
- Oh, Amy, Amy.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.300
What are you thinking?

30:35.600 --> 30:38.900
That high school students know
more about Mom's baby than Mom?

30:39.400 --> 30:41.500
I mean, don't you think she
would know who the father is?

30:41.700 --> 30:43.000
She would know when the baby is due,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.800
when the baby was
conceived.She would know.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.400
When she first found
out she was pregnant,

30:46.500 --> 30:48.100
she didn't know who the father was.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.100
Yeah, but I'm sure she's
figured it out by now.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.100
I mean, we all know
they had sex in the garage,

30:52.300 --> 30:54.600
but she wasn't pregnant
for months after that.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.800
She would know.She would.
I don't know about that,Ashley.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.800
She's huge.Maybe she's more
pregnant than she says she is.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.000
Do you want it to be Dad's?

31:02.100 --> 31:04.000
Not unless that's what Mom wants.

31:04.200 --> 31:08.000
If Mom wants it to be Dad's,
then I want it to be Dad's.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.500
Do you want it to be Dad's?

31:09.800 --> 31:13.700
Of course I want it to
be Dad's baby.I mean,

31:13.900 --> 31:16.600
I would love to move
back over here with Dad

31:16.600 --> 31:20.300
and for all of us to be
one big happy family.

31:21.900 --> 31:25.300
But unfortunately,it's not Dad's.
That's just not going to happen,

31:25.400 --> 31:27.100
and we're just going to
have to live with that, Amy.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.000
Mom is having a baby with David,

31:30.400 --> 31:32.300
and her life is starting over.

31:32.700 --> 31:35.600
She has her own life now,
her own family.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.800
What about us?

31:39.600 --> 31:43.300
- Us? What, you and John?
- No, Ashley.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.100
You and me.
We're her children, too.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.400
We're her family--you, me and John.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
We're her family with her first husband.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.400
That doesn't matter.
She's still our mom.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.500
Just like I'll always be
John's mom no matter what.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.400
You know what, Amy?I
think this is one of those things

32:00.400 --> 32:02.600
that I'm just not going
to understand till I'm older,

32:02.800 --> 32:06.600
- until I'm a mother.
- Yeah. Probably.

32:08.500 --> 32:12.500
Hey, you don't think Dad
would lie about his vasectomy,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.100
- do you?
- Come on.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.800
If he had lied about his vasectomy,he
would've gotten her pregnant long before now.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.500
- I mean, that was almost ten years ago.
- Yeah.

32:21.300 --> 32:24.600
- Are you going to be okay?
- Yeah. I guess.

32:25.300 --> 32:28.700
Mom left me a message on my phone.
She's going to be out with David tonight.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.000
All right. Well--

32:30.200 --> 32:32.700
And Ben and I got in a fight
because I called Betty--

32:33.100 --> 32:36.300
you know, his dad's fiance--a hooker.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.000
That's okay.I think
she is a hooker.

32:38.200 --> 32:42.100
- Why would Mr. Boykewich be with a hooker?
- Why would Mom be with David?

32:43.100 --> 32:45.200
Look, these things just happen,

32:45.400 --> 32:48.600
and we have to accept
that that's the way things are.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.100
See you.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.000
- Hey, Ashley.
- Yeah?

32:54.200 --> 32:58.000
Don't tell Dad that I thought
he lied about,you know,

32:58.400 --> 32:59.800
his surgery.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.300
I don't want him to think
that I would ever think that

33:03.500 --> 33:06.900
he would do something so stupid.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.900
I don't even know how
that rumor got started.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.900
You need me to hang out for a while?

33:31.100 --> 33:33.000
- I heard you on the phone.
- Bye.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.300
How could you give
Dad's sports coat to Jack?

33:35.500 --> 33:38.100
I didn't act alone.
Mom did, too.

33:38.300 --> 33:39.900
We like Jack.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.400
Yeah, they like me,
and I liked your dad a lot.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.700
Well, fine.Just take the sports
coat,if that's what you want.

33:45.900 --> 33:48.200
- Thanks.
- Wrong answer.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.600
Good night.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.100
What? I want the coat.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.100
You know I don't really want
you to take the coat.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.700
I know what you really
want is your dad.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.700
You know,it really helped to
talk to you and Madison today.

34:05.700 --> 34:07.800
Who else do we know
that lost a parent?

34:08.199 --> 34:10.300
- Ben.
- Ben.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.800
Poor Ben.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.100
You know his dad is
about to marry Betty?

34:14.300 --> 34:17.000
- Who?
- Betty, Tom's Internet hooker.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.600
You know, I'm still
in a state of shock.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.500
I keep talking too much
about all the wrong things.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.699
- Tom's Internet hooker?
- More like a friend.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.600
Oh. Hmm.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.600
<i>Betty.
Tom.</i>

34:33.000 --> 34:36.300
Uh, I know it's early.
Is your family around?

34:36.500 --> 34:39.800
<i>No.
Good. Then we can talk.</i>

34:40.199 --> 34:42.500
Uh, first of all,
I would like to say

34:42.500 --> 34:45.000
I am so sorry
about your father.

34:45.199 --> 34:49.199
- Me, too. Thanks.
- And secondly,

34:49.600 --> 34:52.300
you know,when I waved
to you at the church,

34:52.600 --> 34:55.500
I think Ben might've
figured out who I am.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.300
No, I don't think so.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.900
- You didn't say anything to anybody?
- No.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.200
Oh, Tom, that's so nice of you.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.600
But today, you know,
I saw your sister at school.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.000
Do you think she said anything?

35:09.200 --> 35:13.200
Nah. She did not say anything.

35:13.700 --> 35:17.200
She don't want no people
to know I know you.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.600
I hadn't even thought of that.

35:20.100 --> 35:22.300
You are so smart.

35:23.100 --> 35:26.300
Well, honey, I, uh--
I would love to tell Ben,

35:26.400 --> 35:28.300
but I just can't.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.500
I-- I've found
the love of my life,

35:30.500 --> 35:32.900
and I-- I just don't want
to lose him, you know?

35:33.100 --> 35:36.600
- I know.
- All right. I guess I'd better go. Bye-bye.

35:36.800 --> 35:40.000
Hi. My dad'll just be a minute.
Ricky wanted to talk to him.

35:40.100 --> 35:43.300
What a coincidence.
I wanted to talk to you.

35:43.500 --> 35:46.000
Ben, there's something
I have to tell you.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.600
You don't have to tell me anything
you don't want to tell me, Betty.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.500
I just want you to know...

35:54.500 --> 35:57.400
that I've been named
Court Reporter of the Month.

36:05.100 --> 36:06.600
With Ben not here
for the summer,

36:06.600 --> 36:09.300
I was wondering if the budget would
allow me to work more hours--

36:09.500 --> 36:11.500
hours that would've
been his hours and--

36:11.900 --> 36:13.500
Or, I know you pay
a cleaning service.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.700
I clean really well.I could
save you some money there.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.100
I'm willing to work 12-hour days.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.700
Hold it, hold it. What is it
you're trying to buy?

36:19.900 --> 36:22.400
- You need the money for something?
- I want to move out of my parents' house.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.900
I talked to them about it.
I want to emancipate.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.500
I'll get kicked out of the
foster care system next year,

36:27.500 --> 36:29.200
and then it'll start
costing them to have me there.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.300
And I don't want
to be there anymore.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.900
I love them, but I want
a place by myself--

36:34.100 --> 36:36.100
a place where I can bring my son.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.700
I'm not looking for any handout.I'm
just looking for hours--more hours.

36:39.900 --> 36:42.500
I found a studio apartment,and
if I save my money all summer,

36:42.500 --> 36:45.500
I'll have the deposit
and an extra month's rent paid,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.600
depending on how much I can work.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.300
And if I'm putting you in an
awkward position by asking,

36:51.500 --> 36:54.000
I apologize.I just thought
I'd try here first

36:54.000 --> 36:55.800
before I look for a
second job somewhere else.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.500
I think I can help you out.
And you know what, Ricky?

36:58.700 --> 37:00.300
With my help or without my help,

37:00.500 --> 37:02.800
I can tell
you're going to do okay.

37:02.900 --> 37:06.100
This is going to be a really good
summer for you.You're on your way.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.400
Come on.I want to
show you something.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.200
I had thought about showing this
to you a few years from now.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.000
But what the heck?

37:14.200 --> 37:15.500
Ever see the upstairs here?

37:15.700 --> 37:18.000
No. I didn't even know
there was an upstairs here.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.300
Yeah. Come on.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.700
I hope the electricity
is still on up here.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah. It still works.

37:32.300 --> 37:33.600
What is this?

37:34.200 --> 37:37.000
We use it for storage.It's
the old family apartment.

37:37.100 --> 37:40.500
My grandparents lived here.
Well, they did for a long time.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.400
- It's nice.
- Think you could clean it up?

37:43.600 --> 37:46.900
Sure. I can clean it up.I can
even paint it,if you want me to.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.300
Well, what are you going
to do with it?

37:49.500 --> 37:50.800
What am I going to do with it?

37:51.500 --> 37:54.800
I'm going to let you live in it,
if it's okay with your parents.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.700
- How much?
- Ah, just something towards the utilities.

37:59.300 --> 38:02.700
Ah, don't do that.
It's not that nice a place.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.600
And my Aunt Louise died up here.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.900
She still comes around
once in a while.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.300
I'm just kidding.
Nobody died here.

38:11.800 --> 38:14.100
I swear, I'll be totally
respectful of your property.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.300
And I'll work for free.
I'll work nights, weekends.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.700
Slow down.I'll pay you when you
work just like I would anyone else.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.600
And you can't work all the time.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.800
You gotta take time
to be with your son.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.200
Speaking of which,my
son is waiting for me,so

38:27.400 --> 38:29.300
lock up when you leave.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.100
Mr. Boykewich,

38:33.400 --> 38:35.000
I don't know what to say.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.500
Say thank you.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.100
Thank you.

38:38.300 --> 38:39.700
Good night, Ricky.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.800
- hello
- Adrian, you're not going to believe this.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.600
- I got a place.
- You got a place?

38:55.700 --> 38:57.000
Yeah. I'm here right now.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.500
Mr. Boykewich gave me this
apartment over the butcher shop.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.900
- It's great.
- You're kidding.Can I come see it?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.200
Not yet. I want to get
it all cleaned up first.

39:05.300 --> 39:08.500
- I'll come over and help you.
- No. That's okay.It's my first place.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.800
I want to do it myself.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.800
- I just want to see it.
- Not tonight, Adrian.But soon.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.900
I promise.I just
wanted to tell you.

39:15.100 --> 39:18.100
Thanks. Thanks for telling me.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.900
- What?
- Ricky just got a place.

39:27.100 --> 39:30.400
- An apartment over the butcher shop.
- And?

39:32.800 --> 39:34.700
Don't you get any ideas
about moving in with him.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.800
What? No, I'm not going
to move in with him.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.500
I'm not going to
move inwith any guy.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.900
And now you've messed
everything up for me.

39:41.100 --> 39:44.900
Ricky's not going to come over to
see me when he's got a place of his own.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.100
This never would have happened if
you and Ruben had already gotten a place.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.300
If I had a place
to be with Ricky,

39:51.500 --> 39:53.000
Ricky wouldn't even
have been looking.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.200
- Adrian.
- Mom, just call George.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.300
See if he's moving back in
with Amy's mother.We need a house.

39:58.300 --> 39:59.800
What difference is that
going to make now?

39:59.900 --> 40:02.400
If we bought George's
house,at least I'd know

40:02.400 --> 40:05.200
when Ricky's over at Amy's
and what he's doing with her,

40:05.400 --> 40:08.500
and if he's lying or not lying about
being over there with the baby.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.600
I don't think I want
to be living next to George.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.700
And we're not buying a house just
so you can spy on your boyfriend,

40:13.800 --> 40:15.300
even if it's in the school district.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.500
It is.And it's a nice house.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.400
- Why don't you call him?
- Maybe I will.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.100
Not tonight, but maybe.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.500
David, I don't know how
much longer we can do this.

40:30.900 --> 40:34.800
We're almost finished.
We just have the master bath

40:34.800 --> 40:37.500
and the terrace area
off the master bedroom.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.000
The guy can't do his own terrace?

40:39.100 --> 40:41.200
It's green already.It's outdoors.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.600
Do you want to go
with brick flooring so

40:43.800 --> 40:46.800
- it'll match the garden area?
- He might want a pool instead of a garden.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.000
- I thought you didn't want a pool.
- I don't.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.500
I mean, not unless you can make it
look like a pond or something

40:51.600 --> 40:53.500
so it doesn't look so much
newer than the property.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.400
But the owner might.I don't know.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.700
So should we or should we not

40:57.800 --> 41:00.100
put in a cement pond?

41:01.100 --> 41:03.600
A pond.A small swimming pool--

41:03.900 --> 41:05.200
black bottom,solar heated.

41:05.400 --> 41:08.400
Changed your mind. Good.
Okay. Now, where were we?

41:08.500 --> 41:10.700
This is a huge project.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.800
Shouldn't we get the
interior designer to do this?

41:12.900 --> 41:15.200
You're the one
that's promoting green.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.400
And I want this house
to be totally green.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.100
The owner wants it that way.

41:19.300 --> 41:21.400
Well, then, shouldn't the owner
be making these decisions?

41:21.500 --> 41:25.100
He doesn't really care.He just wants
to be in by the end of the summer.

41:25.300 --> 41:28.600
- And I have to order everything.
- In one day?

41:28.800 --> 41:32.200
- Are you having any fun?
- I was, but now I'm kind of tired.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.100
Couldn't we just
finish this tomorrow?

41:34.300 --> 41:35.900
I'd really like to get
home to Amy and John.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.700
Amy can take care of John.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.700
And Amy's going to
have to take care of John.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.000
She will, eventually.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.800
When we're married,
when the baby comes,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.700
we're not going to want to live in
the same house as Amy and John

41:47.900 --> 41:50.500
or next door to George and Ashley.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.100
Should we all
move into your loft?

41:52.200 --> 41:55.400
I think we-- the two of us--
should move into this house.

41:55.600 --> 41:58.500
It's not in the same city,
but it's close to your mother.

41:58.700 --> 42:01.200
- I mentioned that, right?
- A few times.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.800
So what, you're going to just try
to buy the house from this guy?

42:04.000 --> 42:05.800
I am that guy.

42:06.400 --> 42:10.300
It's got a guest house,
if Amy decides to move,

42:10.300 --> 42:12.500
and there's plenty of room
for Ashley to visit.

42:12.700 --> 42:14.900
- It's perfect.
- I'm sorry. What?

42:15.000 --> 42:18.400
I bought it a few years ago.I've
been working on it whenever I could.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.100
I think we should finish
it for the two of us--

42:21.100 --> 42:24.800
Sorry. Three of us--
you, me and the kid.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.600
I can't believe
I'm going to be a dad.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.200
I know it's a lot to think about,

42:29.400 --> 42:33.300
but if you put that ring
on your finger that I got you...

42:33.300 --> 42:37.200
It's magic. It'll completely
clear your mind.
