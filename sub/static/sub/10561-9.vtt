00:53.181 --> 00:54.681
The gloves are worthless.

00:54.749 --> 00:57.751
I'll take the dress, though.

00:57.818 --> 00:59.286
Two bits.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.221
Please. It cost near $3.

01:02.256 --> 01:05.424
- My mother gave it to...
- To me it's worth two bits.

01:05.492 --> 01:08.427
Accept it or not.

01:16.069 --> 01:18.036
I'll even throw in this.

01:18.070 --> 01:21.939
You can change behind there.

01:38.657 --> 01:42.125
- You need some help back there?
- I'm all right.

01:42.160 --> 01:53.002
As long as you're sure.

01:53.003 --> 01:56.138
- Shylock!
- Get out of here.

01:56.173 --> 01:58.575
Ugh.

01:58.609 --> 02:00.310
Come on!

02:13.055 --> 02:15.123
Hurry! She's getting away!

02:19.028 --> 02:22.530
Over here!

02:27.802 --> 02:30.371
- Ugh!
- Enough!

02:30.370 --> 02:34.106
Let's go! Come on!

02:37.276 --> 02:40.512
Why do you suppose he
was in here so late, sir?

02:40.580 --> 02:42.614
I have no idea, George.

02:44.550 --> 02:46.518
Well, maybe we'll get lucky, sir.

02:46.586 --> 02:49.521
Perhaps somebody heard something.

02:49.555 --> 02:51.523
In the alley?

02:51.557 --> 02:54.124
Cordon off the area. We'll be right there.

02:56.228 --> 02:58.362
I wonder who else was in here.

02:58.396 --> 03:01.898
Sir, there's something in the
alley you should have a look at.

03:08.672 --> 03:10.707
She was in the pawnshop.

03:18.382 --> 03:21.484
- George. George, get a doctor!
- She's alive?

03:21.518 --> 03:23.085
Just go, George!

03:25.054 --> 03:27.322
- Where's he going?
- Miss.

03:27.390 --> 03:30.825
- You're all right. Easy.
- Ah!

03:30.893 --> 03:32.827
I can't move my legs.

03:32.862 --> 03:35.297
I can't move my legs.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.655
A guard found him about 20 minutes ago.

03:43.722 --> 03:45.189
And why contact me?

03:45.257 --> 03:49.326
Before he did this, he
was asking to talk to you.

03:51.263 --> 03:52.996
Oh, my God.

03:53.064 --> 03:55.498
Reg.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.534
Do you know him?

03:57.569 --> 04:00.637
I did. A lifetime ago.

04:00.705 --> 04:03.540
What would you like me to do?

04:03.608 --> 04:05.676
Cut him down.

04:14.184 --> 04:17.486
He was alive when I did my
rounds at four in the morning,

04:17.519 --> 04:20.422
sitting upright on his bed, as I recall.

04:20.490 --> 04:23.892
- How were his spirits?
- I didn't stop for a chin wag.

04:23.926 --> 04:24.626
It's unusual.

04:24.627 --> 04:26.327
Reginald Pullen was to
be released this year.

04:26.328 --> 04:27.773
Why would he kill himself?

04:28.030 --> 04:30.966
- Did he have any visitors recently?
- Never a one.

04:31.033 --> 04:34.368
He told me that his wife
had died a few years ago.

04:34.436 --> 04:37.572
- Lucille.
- Yes, I believe that was her name.

04:37.606 --> 04:39.574
What were the charges against him?

04:39.608 --> 04:41.976
Assaulting an officer.
He was found in a tavern

04:42.010 --> 04:44.178
which was open illegally after hours.

04:44.213 --> 04:46.214
- And he ended up in here.
- Five months ago.

04:46.248 --> 04:49.616
Oh, he talked back to the
judge and got a longer sentence

04:49.650 --> 04:51.818
than need be for his pains.

04:51.852 --> 04:55.021
Hm. That sounds like Reg; suicide doesn't.

04:55.089 --> 04:58.391
Ah. Self-murder is not so unusual
in a place like this, Inspector.

04:58.426 --> 05:01.394
Remorse and despair are twin companions.

05:01.429 --> 05:05.131
- Did Pullen have any particular pals?
- Potter, can you answer

05:05.165 --> 05:08.467
- the inspector's question?
- No, sir. I'm afraid not.

05:08.502 --> 05:10.068
You could try Hobson.

05:10.103 --> 05:12.070
- Another prisoner?
- Just this do-gooder.

05:12.105 --> 05:16.908
He works for an organization that helps
prisoners return to decent society.

05:16.943 --> 05:19.445
He's got the use of the old library.

05:19.479 --> 05:20.979
Thank you.

05:24.650 --> 05:28.219
You could spend a couple
dollars and spruce this place up.

05:28.254 --> 05:32.390
Or you lot could clean up after yourselves.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.631
Are you quite sure, Miss Butler?

05:40.665 --> 05:43.500
I didn't see him. I
didn't see anyone. I was

05:43.535 --> 05:47.003
- behind the curtain changing.
- And yet, you escaped.

05:47.038 --> 05:49.473
Is that what you call this? Escape?

05:49.507 --> 05:53.076
Miss Butler, there was significant
damage to the pawn shop.

05:53.110 --> 05:55.244
Are you sure there was just one man?

05:55.279 --> 05:58.747
I've told you all I
know. I didn't see anyone!

05:58.815 --> 06:01.250
Miss Butler. The detective
is only doing his duty.

06:01.285 --> 06:04.487
The doctor says you're healing quite well.

06:04.555 --> 06:08.257
I've tried to explain to Miss Butler
that there is no reason she cannot walk.

06:08.292 --> 06:10.992
The knife did no damage
to her spinal column,

06:11.060 --> 06:14.362
and no major internal organs were affected.

06:14.430 --> 06:17.965
Then why can't I walk?
Why can't I feel anything?

06:18.033 --> 06:19.834
Detective Murdoch.

06:19.868 --> 06:24.105
Rest well, Miss Butler.

06:24.139 --> 06:26.440
I regret to say she is malingering.

06:26.508 --> 06:27.941
Why would she do that?

06:27.975 --> 06:29.943
As long as she can claim
to be a victim of crime,

06:30.011 --> 06:32.112
the hospital board will take pity on her.

06:32.180 --> 06:34.315
She can stay here indefinitely.

06:34.382 --> 06:35.982
Free room and board.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.984
You've examined her thoroughly?

06:38.052 --> 06:40.987
Yes. The knife wound is superficial.

06:41.022 --> 06:43.155
She can't stay here much longer.

06:43.190 --> 06:47.260
We have patients with real
illnesses who are in need of a bed.

07:05.846 --> 07:10.015
George, I need you to canvass
the area around the pawnshop.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.516
Of course.

07:11.584 --> 07:13.518
Any news on the MacGinnis murder?

07:13.586 --> 07:16.520
- Not yet, sir.
- What did they want with you at the prison, sir?

07:16.588 --> 07:19.390
Nothing. Just a bloody suicide.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.623
Open the door, Tom.

07:54.658 --> 07:58.161
Come on, you've done it before.

07:58.195 --> 08:00.562
I should let you bloody well rot in here.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.234
Then leave me.

08:06.302 --> 08:08.103
What do you expect, Reg?

08:08.137 --> 08:10.538
I expect you to let me out of here.

08:10.606 --> 08:13.508
So you can piss your life away?

08:13.542 --> 08:16.778
The man deserved a beating.
He was picking on some

08:16.846 --> 08:18.813
drunk old sot. I was evening the odds.

08:18.847 --> 08:21.348
If you want to right the
world's wrongs, re-enlist!

08:23.285 --> 08:25.252
What's so funny, Reg?

08:25.287 --> 08:28.956
They wouldn't take me
back, even if I wanted.

08:28.990 --> 08:31.125
They took my Victoria Cross.

08:31.159 --> 08:32.693
Why?

08:32.727 --> 08:36.095
Fist fight six months ago.

08:36.130 --> 08:38.331
They took it away for that?

08:38.365 --> 08:41.767
They said it was for dishonourable conduct.

08:45.239 --> 08:47.907
I've fished you out of here too many times.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.610
Tom.

08:52.645 --> 08:55.147
Please, Tommy.

08:55.181 --> 08:57.115
Come on!

09:08.760 --> 09:10.694
Bloody vulture he was.

09:10.729 --> 09:13.197
Did Mr. MacGinnis have any enemies?

09:13.232 --> 09:15.199
He certainly didn't have any friends

09:15.267 --> 09:17.001
How did you get these wounds?

09:17.035 --> 09:20.004
I fell down. Tripped on the stairs.

09:20.072 --> 09:22.005
A truthful answer would
be appreciated, sir.

09:22.039 --> 09:25.008
MacGinnis lent me money; he wanted it back.

09:25.076 --> 09:27.177
So he did this to you?

09:27.245 --> 09:30.046
He had people for that. When do we get

09:30.114 --> 09:33.350
- our things back?
- They still belong to him.

09:33.384 --> 09:36.353
- That ain't right!
- Well, I'm sorry, but that's the law...

09:36.420 --> 09:39.654
This copper here says that MacGinnis
gets to take what's ours to the grave!

09:39.722 --> 09:42.657
Get your batons ready. Get your
batons ready. All right, people,

09:42.725 --> 09:45.394
break this up now!

09:45.428 --> 09:48.230
When somebody is hanged,
the noose leaves a contusion

09:48.265 --> 09:50.599
following closely along
the jaw line. However,

09:50.666 --> 09:53.435
if somebody is strangled,
the bruising is much lower,

09:53.503 --> 09:56.604
and almost invariably the
hyoid bone is broken...

09:56.671 --> 09:58.606
as this one is.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.110
He was strangled first and then strung up.

10:02.177 --> 10:04.879
The belt was used for both deeds.

10:04.947 --> 10:07.882
No man's would give his
belt up just like that.

10:07.950 --> 10:10.017
- His killer must have overpowered him.
- He did.

10:10.084 --> 10:12.953
Look. Beneath the hairline.

10:13.021 --> 10:15.289
He was hit hard, by the look of it.

10:15.356 --> 10:18.253
There are no defensive wounds
on his hands or his arms.

10:18.254 --> 10:19.603
There was no struggle.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.229
That could be why no one heard anything.

10:22.297 --> 10:24.731
Stupid bugger.

10:24.799 --> 10:27.133
Inspector?

10:29.102 --> 10:31.337
Thank you, Dr. Grace.

10:37.544 --> 10:40.679
So what is it exactly
that you do, Mr. Hobson?

10:40.713 --> 10:43.848
I work with men who are soon
to be released into society...

10:43.882 --> 10:46.284
give them a hand up, so to speak.

10:46.352 --> 10:48.886
Mr. Pullen was just six months away.

10:48.955 --> 10:51.856
- He was a good man.
- I wasn't talking to you.

10:51.924 --> 10:54.025
That's enough, Mr. Walker.

10:54.093 --> 10:57.128
I agree with Richard. Mr.
Pullen's death is a great loss.

10:57.196 --> 10:59.563
You don't have to lie to me. I knew him.

10:59.630 --> 11:01.932
Well, if that's your sense of
him, you didn't know him well.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.968
I knew him bloody well enough.

11:04.002 --> 11:07.804
And he wasn't this besainted fellow
you're all making him out to be.

11:07.839 --> 11:11.442
Well, I suppose I should
expect a policeman's judgment

11:11.476 --> 11:13.944
to be harsh, but I enjoyed his company.

11:13.978 --> 11:16.379
And he was more good than bad.

11:18.815 --> 11:21.150
That's all for now.

11:26.991 --> 11:28.958
Oy.

11:28.993 --> 11:31.893
What can you tell me about Reg Pullen?

11:36.366 --> 11:37.966
Piss off.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.302
I suppose you don't know who
you're talking to, do you?

11:42.336 --> 11:43.771
Later. Talk to me later.

11:46.208 --> 11:50.144
Ah! That's enough! He's down!

11:50.178 --> 11:51.912
Now back off!

11:59.787 --> 12:01.989
Dr. Ogden?

12:02.023 --> 12:03.990
Detective Murdoch.

12:04.025 --> 12:05.992
What can I do for you?

12:06.027 --> 12:10.296
I have someone who I believe has witnessed
a murder, but she refuses to talk to me.

12:10.331 --> 12:14.367
She appears to be quite
literally paralyzed by fear.

12:14.402 --> 12:17.003
What do you mean?

12:17.038 --> 12:19.671
She has no use of her legs.

12:19.705 --> 12:22.674
She can't move, even though
the attending physician says

12:22.708 --> 12:24.876
there's nothing physically wrong with her.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.812
Well, I'll see what I can do.

12:27.892 --> 12:29.593
Shall we?

12:39.239 --> 12:42.574
I'm sorry. Business to take care of.

12:42.609 --> 12:44.709
Now, what can I do for you?

12:44.777 --> 12:47.679
Reginald Pullen. It wasn't a suicide.

12:47.713 --> 12:48.580
Sir?

12:48.615 --> 12:51.449
- It was murder.
- How?

12:51.517 --> 12:53.417
I don't know.

12:53.452 --> 12:56.420
- Another inmate, perhaps.
- Likely.

12:56.488 --> 12:58.422
That said, I'd like to see an inmate

12:58.490 --> 13:00.992
who wants to talk to me. Richard Walker.

13:01.060 --> 13:02.493
Huh!

13:02.561 --> 13:04.729
- What's so funny?
- Well, of course he does.

13:04.764 --> 13:07.164
Ever since Walker arrived, he has protested

13:07.198 --> 13:09.332
his innocence against
all charges against him.

13:09.367 --> 13:11.835
It's the usual nonsense some of them spout.

13:11.903 --> 13:14.271
That's not what I'm here
to talk to him about.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.663
It's a bit gloomy, isn't it?

13:17.664 --> 13:21.192
Well, we're not running one
of Mr. Kellogg's sanatoriums.

13:23.881 --> 13:25.815
How long do the buggers last down here?

13:25.883 --> 13:27.984
Oh, it doesn't usually take
more than a night or two

13:28.052 --> 13:30.953
before they see the error of their ways.

13:34.257 --> 13:36.125
Good God.

13:44.513 --> 13:46.614
I'll need him down at the city morgue.

13:46.683 --> 13:48.783
Well, the cause of
death seems plain enough.

13:48.850 --> 13:50.143
You've lost two prisoners.

13:50.144 --> 13:53.320
Do you not want to find
out who was behind this?

13:53.354 --> 13:55.089
Of course.

13:57.829 --> 14:00.294
How'd the killer get
in? Aren't doors supposed

14:00.328 --> 14:02.563
- to be locked in jails?
- It's an oversight.

14:02.390 --> 14:04.357
You'd throw a man in
solitary and not lock him in?

14:04.391 --> 14:06.493
How many of the guards
have the keys to that door?

14:06.527 --> 14:09.863
I don't like your tone,
Inspector, nor your implications.

14:09.897 --> 14:12.332
We're very careful with
the men we employ here.

14:12.399 --> 14:16.636
Well, if you have any other
explanation, I'm all ears.

14:20.774 --> 14:23.041
Right with you, Inspector.

14:23.076 --> 14:26.211
Would you allow us some
privacy, Mr. Turnbow?

14:26.245 --> 14:28.881
- You've heard about Walker?
- I have.

14:28.915 --> 14:30.850
You know these men. Any thoughts?

14:30.917 --> 14:33.018
I'm afraid to say it
could have been anyone.

14:33.086 --> 14:36.053
- And why's that?
- Walker was a magpie.

14:36.088 --> 14:38.055
He'd steal anything he'd see.

14:38.090 --> 14:41.693
Men in here don't have much,
so you don't take what they got.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.829
Mr. Hobson, according to the coroner,

14:44.864 --> 14:49.233
Reggie Pullen was not a
suicide. He was strangled.

14:49.267 --> 14:50.902
That's terrible.

14:50.936 --> 14:53.403
But I don't know how I can help you.

14:53.437 --> 14:56.406
You said you knew Reg.
Who were his enemies?

14:56.440 --> 14:59.510
- He kept to himself.
- What about the dead man?

14:59.544 --> 15:01.678
Walker palled around with Mr. Pullen,

15:01.713 --> 15:04.180
but I didn't get the impression
Pullen had much liking for him.

15:04.215 --> 15:07.183
I'd say tolerated at best.

15:07.218 --> 15:10.019
Are you sure it was murder?

15:10.053 --> 15:12.522
I'd appreciate it if you were
to keep all this under your hat,

15:12.556 --> 15:16.291
Mr. Hobson. I don't want to
scare away my rabbit just yet.

15:19.630 --> 15:22.031
Take your time, Miss Butler.

15:22.065 --> 15:24.198
Have a look through the photographs

15:24.233 --> 15:26.768
and tell me if you recognize anyone.

15:26.802 --> 15:30.772
I'm sorry, Detective. I didn't see anyone.

15:30.806 --> 15:34.409
Sometimes we see more than we think we do.

15:36.345 --> 15:40.548
Now, please, if you recognize anyone.

15:40.582 --> 15:42.416
No.

15:42.450 --> 15:45.019
No one at all.

15:45.053 --> 15:47.588
No.

15:53.261 --> 15:57.764
Him. I can't be sure, but perhaps.

16:01.702 --> 16:04.938
Miss Butler, I understand
how afraid you must feel.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.373
But would you try something for me?

16:07.407 --> 16:09.375
Just leave me alone.

16:09.409 --> 16:11.143
I will, but first,

16:11.211 --> 16:13.946
would you mind trying to move your legs?

16:13.980 --> 16:15.714
I can't.

16:15.782 --> 16:17.816
Please, indulge me.

16:29.061 --> 16:33.263
You see? Now will you
please just leave me alone?

16:38.937 --> 16:41.371
I'll ask the attending
physician that she be

16:41.439 --> 16:43.373
transferred into my care.

16:43.441 --> 16:47.410
Her medical evaluation seems sound, but
she is clearly suffering from something.

16:47.478 --> 16:48.912
Thank you, Julia.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.914
Do you think she recognized any of the men?

16:50.982 --> 16:54.183
Only if Constable Higgins has
decided to become a murderer.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.822
Sir, Mr. MacGinnis is a loan shark,

16:59.889 --> 17:01.824
his shop little more than a front,

17:01.891 --> 17:04.326
and there are more than a
few who would wish him ill.

17:04.393 --> 17:05.828
Anything else?

17:05.895 --> 17:08.530
Yes, I found the name of
one of his "persuader" types.

17:08.564 --> 17:11.532
- Leeland Flowers.
- Right. Find him.

17:11.601 --> 17:14.136
I have, sir. He's in
the interview room now.

17:20.308 --> 17:22.743
I worked for MacGinnis when needed.

17:22.810 --> 17:25.646
And what was the nature of your employment?

17:25.681 --> 17:28.616
I made sure people lived
up to their obligations.

17:28.684 --> 17:30.952
And if they didn't?

17:31.020 --> 17:34.788
On the rare occasion that
a second visit was required,

17:34.822 --> 17:38.158
most of them were able to find
the money one way or another.

17:38.192 --> 17:41.227
Would any of these clients have reason

17:41.262 --> 17:43.930
- to kill Mr. MacGinnis?
- Plenty had reason.

17:43.965 --> 17:46.366
But I doubt if any had the capacity.

17:48.434 --> 17:51.403
Are you proud of your work, Mr. Flowers?

17:51.437 --> 17:53.572
Little different from yours, I suspect,

17:53.606 --> 17:57.843
collecting on debts owed.

17:57.878 --> 18:01.013
There are two wounds. The edges
of each are clean, not ragged.

18:01.048 --> 18:03.515
The weapon was probably a regular knife

18:03.550 --> 18:08.019
with a one-inch-wide blade,
about six inches long. Very sharp.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.321
Both these wounds penetrated the heart.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.590
Hm.

18:23.634 --> 18:26.103
Take a sniff, George.

18:26.137 --> 18:29.372
What do you think it is?

18:29.407 --> 18:31.374
It smells like soot.

18:31.409 --> 18:33.376
It tastes like soot.

18:33.411 --> 18:35.545
You're in the habit of tasting soot?

18:35.580 --> 18:37.880
Well, my Aunt Ivy used to
lower me down the chimney

18:37.915 --> 18:41.318
to clean it. At one point,
that was to be my occupation.

18:47.091 --> 18:48.925
More.

18:59.536 --> 19:02.170
How's it going with the MacGinnis case?

19:02.205 --> 19:04.740
Well, I have a witness who refuses to talk,

19:04.807 --> 19:07.409
and a victim whom most
people are happy to see dead.

19:07.477 --> 19:09.844
Sounds familiar.

19:09.911 --> 19:11.846
Sir?

19:11.880 --> 19:15.216
Two men murdered in prison; no one
gives a toss about them, either.

19:15.251 --> 19:17.985
I knew one of them.

19:18.053 --> 19:20.888
Oh, I see.

19:20.956 --> 19:23.124
Both men were killed inside locked cells.

19:23.158 --> 19:25.525
Where do your suspicions lie?

19:25.560 --> 19:28.795
With someone who holds a key.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.498
Mm. All right.

19:31.532 --> 19:34.768
You were the one who signed
Richard Walker into solitary,

19:34.835 --> 19:38.037
- were you not?
- I was. And then I went off shift.

19:38.072 --> 19:41.006
You were also the one who
found Reginald Pullen dead.

19:41.074 --> 19:42.675
Yeah.

19:42.743 --> 19:45.177
Before he died, Richard
Walker asked to speak

19:45.245 --> 19:47.846
with the Inspector here. Do
you know what that was about?

19:47.914 --> 19:51.350
Walker always wanted to
make himself look important.

19:51.418 --> 19:55.020
A bit of bad luck, isn't it, Mr.
Potter? Two deaths in 24 hours.

19:55.088 --> 19:59.190
There is no need to remind me. It
will be on my conscience forever.

19:59.224 --> 20:01.693
Will it, now? Well, maybe
that's not such a bad thing.

20:01.761 --> 20:04.195
Something to contemplate
while you're breaking stone

20:04.263 --> 20:06.364
in Kingston Penitentiary.

20:06.432 --> 20:09.167
I cannot be sentenced for a
crime somebody else committed.

20:09.234 --> 20:12.170
What about Reg Pullen? Perhaps
you slipped into his cell,

20:12.237 --> 20:14.204
knocked him unconscious,
and then strung him up.

20:14.272 --> 20:17.073
There are 50 men on the
range that can vouch for me.

20:17.141 --> 20:19.710
Prisoners vouching for a man
who holds a gun on them daily

20:19.744 --> 20:21.978
doesn't really mean very much, Mr. Potter.

20:28.985 --> 20:32.955
I must admit, sir, it's hard to think of
a reason why he would want to kill Pullen.

20:32.989 --> 20:34.457
Perhaps he's bent.

20:34.525 --> 20:38.561
Someone here is. Both
Walker and Pullen tried

20:38.629 --> 20:40.896
to communicate with you before they died.

20:40.964 --> 20:43.199
Something is going on here.

20:45.802 --> 20:47.402
The man that I knew,

20:47.470 --> 20:49.971
Reginald Pullen, he won the Victoria Cross.

20:50.005 --> 20:53.709
Who would have guessed that
he'd end up in a place like this?

20:53.776 --> 20:57.078
Who knows the path a
man's life may take, sir?

20:57.146 --> 21:00.114
You go ahead, Murdoch.

21:00.149 --> 21:03.283
Mr. Hobson, sir. A moment of your time.

21:03.352 --> 21:06.487
- I was on the verge of leaving, Inspector.
- I'll keep it brief.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.691
Ready to go?

21:11.726 --> 21:13.693
As soon as I finish with Mr. Walker.

21:13.728 --> 21:15.695
What is this reading we're going to?

21:15.730 --> 21:18.332
Excerpts from a new novel,
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

21:18.366 --> 21:20.334
Tickets were dreadfully expensive.

21:20.368 --> 21:22.302
Oh, I know this one. It's
marvellous. It's about

21:22.370 --> 21:25.071
a little girl, Dorothy,
who's swept away from her home

21:25.105 --> 21:27.907
in Kansas to a mystical
land where she encounters

21:27.941 --> 21:30.409
three curious companions... there's a lion,

21:30.443 --> 21:33.679
- a scarecrow, and this chap made entirely out of tin.
- George...

21:33.713 --> 21:35.882
- They're looking for this
fearsome wizard only to discover

21:35.916 --> 21:37.884
that he's nothing but a little tiny fellow.

21:37.918 --> 21:40.018
I mean, I don't think the
point is that he's tiny.

21:40.052 --> 21:43.288
I think the point is, you know,
things that we believe we lack are

21:43.322 --> 21:45.656
already inside of us
just wanting to be found.

21:45.691 --> 21:48.626
Thank you so much, George.

21:48.660 --> 21:50.628
I've said too much.

21:50.662 --> 21:53.164
Alert me next time you
intend to spoil something.

21:53.199 --> 21:54.766
I'm sorry.

21:57.269 --> 21:59.669
Egg?

22:05.176 --> 22:06.643
How unusual.

22:06.677 --> 22:08.312
Oh, my goodness.

22:08.346 --> 22:11.347
How did that end up in Mr. Walker's gullet?

22:11.415 --> 22:13.482
Hm.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.054
Another?

22:18.122 --> 22:20.390
I thought you good Samaritan
types were teetotal.

22:20.424 --> 22:23.893
Exceptions to every rule.

22:23.928 --> 22:26.562
Why do you bother helping the men in here?

22:26.596 --> 22:29.898
I used to be one of them. Did three years

22:29.966 --> 22:32.834
a long time ago. Then
I turned my life around.

22:32.868 --> 22:36.171
- I see.
- I believe all men have it in them to be good.

22:36.205 --> 22:38.740
They just need a nudge, like your friend.

22:38.808 --> 22:41.410
We were pals, Reg and me.

22:41.477 --> 22:44.245
I came out of the service,

22:44.313 --> 22:46.547
found a wife, found the constabulary.

22:46.581 --> 22:49.750
Reg lost his wife, lost his job,

22:49.818 --> 22:52.420
lost everything that makes a man a man.

22:52.487 --> 22:55.923
He was deeply ashamed of that,
especially losing his medal.

22:55.958 --> 22:59.192
He told me many times that
winning it was his greatest day.

22:59.260 --> 23:02.862
I was there. That night.

23:02.930 --> 23:05.365
Two young lads off to see the world.

23:05.433 --> 23:09.369
What better way than to take the
Queen's shilling and become soldiers?

23:09.437 --> 23:11.204
Afghanistan.

23:11.272 --> 23:14.007
Dust, dirt, hotter than Hades.

23:16.343 --> 23:19.544
The night he won his Victoria
Cross, we were tending to a limber.

23:19.612 --> 23:21.947
It was piled up with injured men.

23:22.015 --> 23:24.083
We were target practice for the tribesmen.

23:24.117 --> 23:27.152
Ugh!

23:27.220 --> 23:31.055
Reg could have made a
run for it, but he didn't.

23:31.090 --> 23:33.757
He brought that man back.

23:41.367 --> 23:45.103
And then he went back into the line
of fire and brought back the rest.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.275
I was the first man he pulled in.

23:54.778 --> 23:57.747
He won his VC saving my life.

23:57.781 --> 23:59.782
He lost it...

23:59.850 --> 24:02.252
because I turned my back on him.

24:10.018 --> 24:13.453
It's not a real eyeball,
of course. It's glass.

24:13.487 --> 24:16.956
A real eyeball would be in a process
of dissolution from stomach acid.

24:17.024 --> 24:19.992
- You found this in Richard Walker's stomach?
- Yes.

24:20.027 --> 24:24.130
I also found this under
his fingernails. It's soot.

24:24.164 --> 24:26.098
I also found traces of it in his hair.

24:26.166 --> 24:28.267
What do you make of it, Murdoch?

24:51.489 --> 24:53.590
That's the lot of them, sir.

24:53.624 --> 24:55.693
And not one missing an eye.

24:55.727 --> 24:59.163
If Mr. Walker went to such
trouble to conceal the eye,

24:59.197 --> 25:02.399
he obviously didn't want anyone
to know it was in his possession.

25:02.433 --> 25:05.168
Hm. You hold on to the damned thing.

25:07.771 --> 25:12.175
Sir, perhaps Walker wasn't
the only one concealing things.

25:14.277 --> 25:17.680
Sit back and close your eyes, Louise.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.616
Please don't open your eyes.

25:21.650 --> 25:24.419
I'm going to use a feather

25:24.453 --> 25:27.255
to touch your leg.

25:27.289 --> 25:30.358
And I'd like you to tell
me if you can feel anything.

25:38.967 --> 25:41.202
Have you done it yet?

25:43.304 --> 25:45.005
You felt nothing?

25:45.073 --> 25:47.108
Nothing.

25:50.678 --> 25:53.646
Our minds can persuade us and our bodies

25:53.714 --> 25:56.582
that we have certain conditions
when in fact we don't.

25:56.650 --> 25:59.318
You think I'm making this up?

26:02.623 --> 26:05.691
- I think you can't walk because you're afraid.
- That's stupid.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.360
That's just stupidity. Perhaps not.

26:08.427 --> 26:12.364
There is a condition
called conversion hysteria.

26:12.431 --> 26:14.800
People who have
experienced extreme fear can

26:14.868 --> 26:18.637
sometimes become literally frozen by it.

26:18.704 --> 26:22.141
I'd like you to think back
to what happened to you.

26:22.175 --> 26:24.142
I told you, I don't remember.

26:24.209 --> 26:27.779
You were in the shop when the man came in.

26:27.846 --> 26:30.848
He shot the shopkeeper,

26:30.916 --> 26:34.051
and then he realized that you were there.

26:34.119 --> 26:36.053
I suppose.

26:36.121 --> 26:38.789
You ran out. He gave chase.

26:38.856 --> 26:40.824
Yes.

26:40.892 --> 26:42.458
And you saw nothing?

26:42.526 --> 26:44.394
I was afraid for my life.

26:44.461 --> 26:47.197
I understand that.

26:47.265 --> 26:49.699
I've been afraid too.

26:49.767 --> 26:52.135
Just leave me alone.

26:52.203 --> 26:54.171
I can't walk.

26:54.205 --> 26:57.072
I'm a coloured girl who can't walk.

26:57.140 --> 27:00.176
But I need you to remember.

27:00.210 --> 27:02.577
The man who did this,

27:02.612 --> 27:04.546
do you know who he is?

27:04.614 --> 27:06.381
I know what you're doing.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.185
You think I'm stupid?

27:09.252 --> 27:11.820
You're trying to trick me
into talking to the police.

27:11.887 --> 27:14.122
- I'm trying to help you.
- No you're not.

27:14.190 --> 27:16.557
You're trying to get me killed.

27:26.435 --> 27:29.736
Let me see those, Murdoch.

27:29.770 --> 27:33.073
Aha. There you go.

27:33.107 --> 27:35.809
When you're a soldier,
Murdoch, you learn to find

27:35.844 --> 27:38.578
a hiding place that you
can get to at any time.

27:38.612 --> 27:40.580
Somewhere to stash your tobacco,

27:40.614 --> 27:43.182
maybe some money, even a needle and thread.

27:45.118 --> 27:46.652
Bloody hell.

27:49.789 --> 27:52.423
Fifty dollars is a lot
of money for a prisoner.

27:52.458 --> 27:54.525
It's a lot for a man anywhere.

28:11.176 --> 28:14.144
- Come on.
- Who's there?
- Hurry!

28:14.179 --> 28:16.480
Kill her!

28:16.514 --> 28:18.749
Ah! Ahhh!

28:23.153 --> 28:25.889
What you saw was a doctor doing his rounds.

28:25.923 --> 28:27.590
What was in his hands?

28:31.528 --> 28:35.265
He was simply checking
the dosage of a syringe.

28:37.201 --> 28:39.667
You can't live the rest of
your life like this, Louise.

28:39.702 --> 28:41.569
I have no choice.

28:41.604 --> 28:43.471
You do.

28:43.506 --> 28:46.308
I know you're holding something
back. You have to let it go.

28:46.342 --> 28:47.809
Why?

28:47.843 --> 28:50.913
I still won't be able to walk.

28:50.947 --> 28:53.916
My life will still be over.

28:53.950 --> 28:55.917
You don't know that.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.386
If you can help Detective
Murdoch, you may be able

28:58.420 --> 29:00.922
to free yourself from your fear.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.690
Please.

29:03.725 --> 29:06.294
Louise, I know you can do this.

29:15.903 --> 29:17.837
You have news, Julia?

29:17.905 --> 29:20.840
She saw three men, and she can identify
the one that pulled the trigger.

29:20.908 --> 29:22.909
Oh, very good. When can I speak with her?

29:22.944 --> 29:24.411
Not right now, William.

29:24.445 --> 29:26.712
Reliving the event was most traumatic.

29:26.780 --> 29:28.814
I've given her a sedative.

29:30.783 --> 29:34.719
- Is everything all right?
- Oh... I'd suspected

29:34.754 --> 29:37.222
that her paralysis was due to her fear,

29:37.290 --> 29:39.724
and I'd hoped that if
she relived the event...

29:39.792 --> 29:42.328
Oh, I'm sorry, Julia.

29:42.395 --> 29:44.795
It's days like this that
make me miss the morgue.

29:44.830 --> 29:47.898
There your patients never
know you've failed them.

29:59.610 --> 30:02.379
Inspector, how goes the good fight?

30:02.447 --> 30:05.048
Still at sixes and sevens, I'm afraid.

30:05.116 --> 30:07.217
You counsel these men, do you not?

30:07.285 --> 30:10.087
- If they request it.
- And not one has acted

30:10.121 --> 30:12.055
the slightest bit
unusual since the murders?

30:12.123 --> 30:14.424
A few of them are wondering
if they will be next.

30:14.459 --> 30:17.326
But these are hard men. They've
lived most of their lives

30:17.361 --> 30:20.696
- with violence.
- How about the guards?

30:20.730 --> 30:23.832
Most are a good lot, but some
are no better than the prisoners.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.668
What about Potter?

30:26.703 --> 30:30.539
I don't know him very well, but few
men in here hold any grudge against him.

30:30.607 --> 30:32.307
Thank you.

30:37.179 --> 30:39.447
Tell the inspector I'll be delayed.

30:39.516 --> 30:42.584
I have to interview a witness to
the MacGinnis murder. Thank you.

30:42.619 --> 30:44.052
Detective.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.688
You should talk to this chap
I've brought in. I believe

30:46.756 --> 30:50.391
we might have something
belonging to him, sir.

30:50.425 --> 30:52.927
I heard you have my eye.

30:52.961 --> 30:54.395
Uh,

30:54.462 --> 30:56.330
I have an eye.

30:56.398 --> 30:58.499
Let me see.

31:00.468 --> 31:02.770
- That's mine.
- He pawned it

31:02.804 --> 31:05.406
- at MacGinnis' shop.
- Could I have it back?

31:05.440 --> 31:08.242
The ladies say I've
lost my looks without it.

31:08.276 --> 31:12.546
He does still owe some money on it, sir.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.681
But...

31:16.651 --> 31:20.420
The moment this case is resolved,
I'll see it's returned to you.

31:20.454 --> 31:22.522
Obliged.

31:25.459 --> 31:27.427
Strange, sir, how that man's

31:27.461 --> 31:29.562
eye ended up in another chap's stomach.

31:29.596 --> 31:32.898
What's even more strange,
George, is that "chap" was

31:32.933 --> 31:35.668
supposed to be in prison
at the time it was stolen.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.805
As I say, I don't know Mr. Browning well,

31:40.839 --> 31:44.076
but he does live high off
the hog for a prison warden.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.744
- Hm.
- Inspector.

31:46.779 --> 31:51.083
Murdoch. Did your witness shed any
light on who killed our Shylock?

31:51.117 --> 31:55.052
Not yet. She's still in Dr.
Ogden's care at the asylum.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.288
Then why are you here?

31:57.322 --> 31:59.290
Well, sir, I have reason to believe

31:59.324 --> 32:01.959
we may be working on the same case.

32:05.942 --> 32:08.910
These items were found in the
possession of the two dead inmates.

32:08.945 --> 32:12.046
- Any explanation?
- The two were thieves.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.449
Your records indicate

32:14.483 --> 32:18.285
that no inmates in custody are
in need of such a prosthetic.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.955
Well, perhaps it belonged to Walker. A...

32:20.989 --> 32:23.458
lucky charm of some sort.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.826
That he carried around in his colon?

32:25.893 --> 32:27.828
And what about the bloody money?

32:27.862 --> 32:31.231
Are prisoners in here
routinely in possession of $50?

32:31.265 --> 32:33.633
I don't know the worth of
every man's personal effects,

32:33.668 --> 32:36.135
sir, but if this amount of
money was stolen from a prisoner,

32:36.203 --> 32:39.906
it would account for
Pullen's murder, would it not?

32:39.940 --> 32:42.375
If I may, sir...

32:44.644 --> 32:46.746
have a look at the bills.

32:46.813 --> 32:48.313
The dates.

32:52.419 --> 32:54.687
May of 1900.

32:54.665 --> 32:58.966
Printed long after Reginald
Pullen was sentenced here.

32:59.034 --> 33:01.736
How could he have come
into possession of them?

33:01.804 --> 33:04.272
Well, someone from the
outside gave it to him.

33:04.340 --> 33:06.841
Bollocks! You said yourself
Reg received no visitors.

33:06.909 --> 33:09.811
Then he stole it from
a prisoner with money!

33:09.878 --> 33:12.447
The more likely explanation is

33:12.515 --> 33:14.448
that the two men escaped from prison,

33:14.516 --> 33:16.450
and were likely involved in a robbery

33:16.518 --> 33:19.085
that took place at a pawn
shop a couple of days ago.

33:19.153 --> 33:22.489
Escaped? Well, then why
the devil would they return?

33:22.557 --> 33:25.091
Maybe you run a nice
establishment. I don't know.

33:25.159 --> 33:27.093
Convenient place to hide out from a crime.

33:27.161 --> 33:30.162
And certainly the last place we would look.

33:30.230 --> 33:31.664
Potter,

33:31.732 --> 33:34.334
the guard who was on duty for both deaths,

33:34.401 --> 33:37.303
he had access to all the cell keys.

33:37.338 --> 33:41.006
Would you like to remind us
again how well you vetted him?

33:46.078 --> 33:48.547
Follow my lead, Murdoch. You, out!

33:51.551 --> 33:54.586
You were the last man to
see Reginald Pullen alive.

33:54.620 --> 33:58.256
You were also the guard who assigned
the second victim, Walker, to solitary.

33:58.324 --> 34:01.792
Good thing too. He attacked you.

34:01.827 --> 34:04.962
He wanted to talk to me.
But you put him in solitary

34:04.996 --> 34:07.531
and he was dead before we
could have our little chat.

34:07.566 --> 34:09.533
I wonder what he would have told me.

34:09.568 --> 34:13.170
A lie. That's what prisoners tell. Lies.

34:13.204 --> 34:15.138
We all tell lies, Mr. Potter.

34:15.206 --> 34:16.841
May I see your knife?

34:18.809 --> 34:20.677
My knife?

34:20.710 --> 34:23.312
The one you had readily on hand
when you cut down my friend.

34:25.983 --> 34:28.351
Detective Murdoch?

34:28.386 --> 34:30.920
You remember Detective Murdoch, do you not?

34:30.954 --> 34:33.889
And you're aware of his reputation?

34:33.956 --> 34:37.958
Detective Murdoch specializes in evidence.

34:37.994 --> 34:40.362
He uses all kinds of geegaws and devices

34:40.397 --> 34:42.630
most coppers have never even heard of.

34:42.665 --> 34:46.635
Your knife here, I suppose he
would be able to tell in due course

34:46.668 --> 34:48.871
whether it was used in
the commission of a crime.

34:48.905 --> 34:51.205
- Isn't that right, Detective?
- It would be,

34:51.239 --> 34:53.808
as the Americans say, easy as pie.

34:53.842 --> 34:57.477
You see, I can detect even
the most remote trace of blood

34:57.512 --> 35:00.147
on this knife, even in the leather sheath

35:00.181 --> 35:02.416
that you holster it in. Failing that,

35:02.450 --> 35:04.418
I have an ultraviolet
light that's capable...

35:04.452 --> 35:05.986
That's enough, Murdoch.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.988
He does go on.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.991
So, who is going to tell
me this knife was used

35:11.026 --> 35:15.429
in the commission of a crime?
You, or Detective Murdoch?

35:25.406 --> 35:29.007
- It was used in the commission of a crime, but I didn't do it.
- Who did?

35:29.042 --> 35:32.445
- A prisoner. Nathan Turnbow.
- Which crime?

35:32.479 --> 35:34.012
The murder of Richard Walker,

35:34.080 --> 35:36.916
or the stabbing of Louise Butler
behind MacGinnis' pawnshop?

35:36.983 --> 35:40.619
- I only know about Walker.
- What about my mate Reggie Pullen?

35:40.654 --> 35:42.488
Mr. Potter!

35:42.522 --> 35:45.156
Look, I only opened the door
for them, that's all I did!

35:45.190 --> 35:46.658
Under whose instruction?

35:46.692 --> 35:50.662
- Nate Turnbow.
- You took orders from a prisoner?

35:50.696 --> 35:52.664
A prisoner who knew where my family lives.

35:52.698 --> 35:54.966
A prisoner who seemed to
be able to travel at will.

35:55.033 --> 35:57.168
Yeah, I took orders from him.

35:57.202 --> 35:59.637
How did they get out of
the prison, Mr. Potter?

35:59.672 --> 36:01.472
I don't know.

36:01.539 --> 36:04.541
They got out of here somehow, Potter.

36:04.609 --> 36:06.643
You'd best tell me how.

36:07.911 --> 36:10.113
It's soot. I also found
traces of it in his hair.

36:10.181 --> 36:11.615
Inspector.

36:11.649 --> 36:13.617
Come with me.

36:15.587 --> 36:17.854
You'd better stay put.

36:25.295 --> 36:27.429
What are we doing on the
bloody prison roof, Murdoch?

36:27.498 --> 36:31.801
Dr. Grace reported finding
soot on prisoner Walker's body.

36:31.869 --> 36:34.102
But the plans say the
chimneys have been blocked off.

36:34.169 --> 36:36.605
Yes, well, that's what they say.

36:57.393 --> 37:00.328
Murdoch.

37:00.396 --> 37:02.930
You could blend in more easily
on the outside wearing these

37:02.998 --> 37:05.365
than prison garb, wouldn't you say?

37:08.669 --> 37:10.904
Have a look at where this one leads to.

37:10.971 --> 37:12.539
Bastard.

37:14.475 --> 37:17.577
That prisoner, Turnbow.
He was in the library.

37:22.882 --> 37:25.451
He was there.

37:27.554 --> 37:31.157
He heard me talking about the
witness. He knows where she is!

37:31.191 --> 37:33.825
You go. I'll handle this one.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.068
You two, get out. Huh?

37:43.102 --> 37:45.236
- Are you deaf?!
- Ah! Sorry, sir.

37:45.271 --> 37:46.904
Inspector Brackenreid.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.276
Sit down and shut up.

37:51.310 --> 37:54.211
You are telling the truth
about one thing, Hobson:

37:54.245 --> 37:56.380
you are dedicating your
life to helping prisoners.

37:56.414 --> 37:59.416
- You're confused.
- Am I?

38:03.521 --> 38:05.789
They got out through the bloody chimney.

38:05.823 --> 38:08.325
- I had nothing to do with this.
- Men you knew!

38:08.359 --> 38:10.393
Men you supposedly counselled!

38:11.127 --> 38:13.317
You're going to spend the rest
of your life in this place.

38:13.318 --> 38:14.672
I doubt that.

38:14.678 --> 38:17.433
You have no proof that I was involved.

38:17.468 --> 38:20.869
Oh! Ugh!

38:23.507 --> 38:24.974
That was for Reg.

38:25.008 --> 38:27.775
You killed him. A military man. A war hero!

38:27.810 --> 38:29.411
A thief and a drunkard.

38:29.445 --> 38:32.981
Ha! Ha! Keep going, Inspector.

38:33.015 --> 38:35.117
The more you hurt me, the better it is.

38:35.151 --> 38:37.319
Why did you kill him? You knew what he was.

38:37.353 --> 38:39.654
You knew the things he'd done.
He was going to go to the law.

38:39.688 --> 38:42.189
- He was trying to talk to you.
- And you couldn't have that,

38:42.224 --> 38:44.108
could you? What about MacGinnis?

38:44.109 --> 38:46.933
Between you and me, he owed me money.

38:46.861 --> 38:48.796
- Nothing more?
- That was enough.

38:48.830 --> 38:52.132
- We've got a bloody witness.
- Are you sure about that?

39:00.774 --> 39:04.310
I thought you said the
detective was coming.

39:04.378 --> 39:06.011
He'll be here.

39:06.079 --> 39:08.180
I don't know about this.

39:08.248 --> 39:12.284
Detective Murdoch will find
the man. He always does.

39:14.254 --> 39:16.288
Let me see what's keeping him.

39:26.499 --> 39:28.868
Look out!

39:28.935 --> 39:31.936
Look out! Look out! Police!

39:32.004 --> 39:34.438
Yes, well, please let
Detective Murdoch know

39:34.506 --> 39:37.942
that Miss Butler is waiting
to talk to him. Thank you.

39:45.351 --> 39:47.217
No. No, please, please, no.

39:47.285 --> 39:50.687
I should have finished you!

39:50.755 --> 39:53.190
Let's go!

39:53.258 --> 39:56.226
- What?
- Move!
- I can't!

39:56.261 --> 39:59.129
If you don't, you die
right here and now! So move!

39:59.197 --> 40:02.698
- Dr. Ogden...
- Not now.

40:32.428 --> 40:34.461
Ugh!

40:37.232 --> 40:38.899
Are you all right?

40:38.934 --> 40:42.769
Yes, William.

40:42.804 --> 40:44.338
Yes.

40:46.441 --> 40:48.508
Louise, it's over.

40:58.713 --> 41:01.582
Thank you for talking to Detective Murdoch.

41:01.616 --> 41:03.884
I know that must have taken courage.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.385
You spoke to my employer?

41:05.420 --> 41:07.421
Yes, and he is awaiting your return,

41:07.455 --> 41:09.622
- and happy to have you.
- Thank you.

41:16.277 --> 41:17.978
I'm sorry.

41:18.012 --> 41:20.412
Every little thing startles me.

41:20.447 --> 41:23.182
Getting over trauma can take time,

41:23.217 --> 41:26.618
but soon this will all be a memory.

41:26.653 --> 41:28.120
I hope so.

41:28.155 --> 41:31.123
I'll be by to call on you.

41:31.158 --> 41:32.992
Thank you.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.135
There she is.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.443
Come on. It's over here.

41:52.478 --> 41:54.044
This way.

41:58.483 --> 42:03.620
Sir. Mr. Turnbow confirmed Mr.
Hobson's involvement in the crimes.

42:03.654 --> 42:05.955
Do we have anything beyond his word?

42:05.990 --> 42:08.124
We served a warrant on Mr. Hobson's home.

42:08.158 --> 42:10.460
It seems he'd accumulated a small fortune.

42:10.528 --> 42:14.162
We found stolen goods from at least
three previously unsolved robberies.

42:14.197 --> 42:16.432
Between that and Mr. Turnbow's testimony,

42:16.500 --> 42:19.435
they should both see the noose. Good.

42:19.469 --> 42:21.804
So, how did the eye end
up in the bloke's stomach.

42:21.838 --> 42:24.373
Mr. Turnbow fed it to him.

42:26.543 --> 42:28.277
Sir,

42:28.344 --> 42:31.145
the Prince of Wales has said that any man

42:31.213 --> 42:33.848
who wins the Victoria Cross should keep it,

42:33.883 --> 42:35.850
even if he's to be hanged.

42:35.918 --> 42:38.219
The Prince of Wales said that?

42:38.253 --> 42:41.556
That's as it was reported.

42:41.590 --> 42:44.392
