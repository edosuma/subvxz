00:02.310 --> 00:03.910
<i>You're kidding...</i>

00:03.910 --> 00:06.020
<i>Was this designed to be impossible?</i>

01:50.560 --> 01:51.500
<i>I lost.</i>

01:55.510 --> 01:57.340
<i>We lost.</i>

01:58.640 --> 02:04.520
<b>Guild Master</b>

02:01.200 --> 02:02.520
Guild Master.

02:07.230 --> 02:08.700
Is that even right?

02:09.070 --> 02:12.900
Three raid bosses at once?

02:13.170 --> 02:14.590
It's not fair.

02:14.590 --> 02:17.400
What was that thing?

02:17.790 --> 02:20.660
I-Is this the only place like this?

02:21.730 --> 02:23.150
You're right.

02:23.580 --> 02:26.910
If all the other raid zones are like this now...

02:27.140 --> 02:29.670
They'll be impossible.

02:29.670 --> 02:34.530
Winning a raid will become impossible.

02:35.930 --> 02:39.540
What were we working so hard for?

02:39.540 --> 02:43.350
We trained, got good equipment, 
and worked together.

02:43.350 --> 02:45.260
We failed and tried again...

02:45.610 --> 02:49.250
When it worked, it felt great.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.310
I felt like I'd grown.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.820
That's all gone now.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.540
Yeah.

02:57.540 --> 02:58.890
There's no point.

02:58.890 --> 03:01.410
No point in doing anything.

03:01.410 --> 03:04.580
The game has abandoned us.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.290
<i>Elder Tale</i> has abandoned us.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.120
So what is this good for, anyway?

03:10.590 --> 03:12.120
A game, huh?

03:12.120 --> 03:14.620
A PC game in this day and age?
Aren't social games good enough?

03:14.620 --> 03:16.090
You stay at home on weekends?

03:16.090 --> 03:17.460
Screw it.

03:17.820 --> 03:20.280
I bet no one ever invites you to karaoke.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.500
Then you talk to your PC, right?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.950
Why not get a hobby that'll be 
more useful to your future?

03:24.950 --> 03:26.810
Well, there are some people like that, right?

03:26.810 --> 03:27.600
I guess it's fine.

03:27.920 --> 03:28.980
Screw it!

03:35.690 --> 03:37.480
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

03:38.350 --> 03:40.490
<i>"We can win next time, so let's do our best"?</i>

03:41.350 --> 03:43.390
<i>"The other raid zones will be okay"?</i>

03:44.420 --> 03:45.360
<i>Those are lies.</i>

03:45.720 --> 03:47.110
<i>I can't say them.</i>

03:47.990 --> 03:49.320
<i>Wait a second.</i>

03:49.320 --> 03:50.490
<i>Then what does this mean?</i>

03:50.990 --> 03:53.290
<i>Does this mean we're—</i>

03:53.290 --> 03:55.000
We're finished.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.370
I guess we can go back to Susukino,

04:05.370 --> 04:08.260
and be a good peacekeeping guild.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.020
That might not be so bad.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.650
Ezzo has a lot of monsters.

04:14.070 --> 04:16.650
The People of the Land will thank us.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.580
Maybe I can get one of them to be my girlfriend.

04:20.940 --> 04:24.410
That might be the smart way to live...

04:25.250 --> 04:26.760
Maybe.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.660
<i>But doesn't that</i>

04:30.340 --> 04:32.410
<i>make us no different from them?</i>

04:32.980 --> 04:34.940
<i>Those bastards who acted like they knew it all</i>

04:34.940 --> 04:38.880
<i>while they gave us advice we were 
supposed to be so thankful for?</i>

04:39.740 --> 04:40.920
Yeah, maybe.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.310
I think you're right.

04:46.030 --> 04:47.800
But what of it?

04:48.590 --> 04:49.680
Screw it!

04:51.630 --> 04:52.800
William?

04:53.980 --> 04:55.590
We lost.

04:55.590 --> 04:56.700
We got wiped out.

04:57.390 --> 04:59.030
We may be finished.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.690
Maybe it was all a waste.

05:01.180 --> 05:03.150
Like they always said...

05:03.530 --> 05:08.070
We're idiots who've wasted our time 
on something as pointless as games.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.650
Game junkies who never leave their houses.

05:10.650 --> 05:11.980
Vegetables.

05:12.670 --> 05:14.220
But who cares?

05:14.600 --> 05:16.890
We knew that all along.

05:17.570 --> 05:19.320
We knew it, and we do it anyway.

05:19.590 --> 05:22.230
But we love games.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.000
We chose this.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.260
<i>I don't care if this is the end.</i>

05:26.600 --> 05:29.030
<i>But I won't give this up.</i>

05:29.430 --> 05:31.710
<i>There are some things you just can't give up.</i>

05:32.540 --> 05:34.320
It's no big deal.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.110
All we did was lose in a raid.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.750
That happens all the time.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.360
There's no need to be shocked.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.520
All it means is that another bit of win-loss data

05:46.520 --> 05:50.000
is recorded on the server.

05:50.790 --> 05:53.610
Games are what children play.

05:54.110 --> 05:55.260
<i>No...</i>

05:55.260 --> 05:57.370
<i>They were special to me.</i>

05:57.750 --> 06:02.280
I won't tell you it's time to grow 
up and head back to town.

06:02.740 --> 06:04.470
I won't let anyone else say it, either.

06:04.850 --> 06:08.590
We may be maggots, losers who got beat...

06:08.590 --> 06:11.880
But I won't let anyone, not even God, 
tell me it was a waste.

06:12.220 --> 06:13.030
<i>That's right.</i>

06:13.410 --> 06:15.390
<i>For me, they were the center of the universe!</i>

06:16.020 --> 06:20.150
What do the bits recorded on the server matter?

06:20.150 --> 06:22.240
They matter.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.150
I've decided they matter.

06:24.520 --> 06:28.910
And I've decided that they're 
wonderful, glorious things!

06:29.760 --> 06:35.160
The idiots who believe that God 
has decided exactly what matters,

06:35.160 --> 06:38.670
and that it applies to every single 
person, won't understand.

06:39.270 --> 06:41.410
No matter how stupid it looks,

06:41.410 --> 06:43.590
no matter how fake and gilded it is,

06:43.590 --> 06:46.960
if I—if we—decide it's amazing,

06:46.960 --> 06:48.380
then it is!

06:48.900 --> 06:50.680
Isn't that what it means to choose?

06:51.480 --> 06:54.130
We chose to be here!

06:54.130 --> 06:57.680
<i>I won't let anyone insult that.</i>

06:58.690 --> 07:01.280
We've spent a lot of time in <i>Elder Tale</i>...

07:02.350 --> 07:04.440
A very long time.

07:04.930 --> 07:07.070
A powerful foe has appeared here,

07:07.070 --> 07:10.850
and we'll take swords or bows or 
whatever we've got, and charge at it.

07:10.850 --> 07:13.950
We'll scream and charge at it like children!

07:14.720 --> 07:18.220
And sometimes we'll win, and sometimes we'll lose.

07:18.220 --> 07:24.530
Sure, it's all a bunch of bits on a server, 
switching between one and zero.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.710
So what?

07:27.040 --> 07:30.200
We've dedicated our lives to it.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.220
And that's amazing!

07:32.910 --> 07:35.730
If we win, we'll have a huge victory party.

07:35.730 --> 07:38.220
We'll each take our share of the 
phantasmals and have a toast.

07:38.710 --> 07:40.490
If we lose, we'll get upset,

07:40.490 --> 07:43.980
and spend the whole day talking 
about what we did wrong.

07:44.490 --> 07:46.950
If you want to say it's stupid, go ahead.

07:46.950 --> 07:49.600
It doesn't matter if it's a toy, or if it's all fake.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.930
We think it's amazing.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.240
We've decided to spend our time on it.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.490
So it's real!

08:00.490 --> 08:03.660
<i>So we lost the raid...</i>

08:04.050 --> 08:06.750
<i>Something sacred and inviolate.</i>

08:07.580 --> 08:09.140
<i>Then what do we do?</i>

08:09.640 --> 08:10.650
<i>What...</i>

08:11.170 --> 08:13.190
<i>What do I say to them?</i>

08:13.540 --> 08:14.760
<i>What can I say?</i>

08:15.050 --> 08:17.940
Because that's what we are, right?

08:18.370 --> 08:20.020
That's who we are!

08:20.450 --> 08:23.600
I don't care about the people who have everything.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.710
<i>What is this?</i>

08:26.060 --> 08:27.750
<i>What am I saying?</i>

08:28.390 --> 08:31.320
People who know how to live in harmony with others

08:31.320 --> 08:32.980
can have anything,

08:33.650 --> 08:36.250
so they can live their lives that way.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.780
<i>What am I talking about?</i>

08:38.060 --> 08:41.100
Do you guys have something like that?

08:41.100 --> 08:42.310
<i>I don't know.</i>

08:42.310 --> 08:43.590
Anything!

08:44.020 --> 08:47.420
Something that allows you to go 
anywhere and befriend anyone.

08:47.790 --> 08:50.800
<i>But this is all I have left.</i>

08:51.090 --> 08:52.930
It can be intelligence.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.500
It can be coolness.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.960
It can be a bright personality.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.800
It can be funny jokes.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.890
It can be anything.

09:00.890 --> 09:05.930
Do you have anything that lets 
you shine in the real world?

09:06.390 --> 09:07.600
I don't!

09:07.910 --> 09:09.540
Not a single thing!

09:11.080 --> 09:14.890
I've never told anyone.

09:14.890 --> 09:16.070
I couldn't.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.450
But you guys are my friends.

09:21.150 --> 09:25.220
Without the game, I wasn't able to make friends.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.430
I'm so lame...

09:27.890 --> 09:29.100
I'm pathetic.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.740
But I've made it this far because I had the game.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.600
I can understand your feelings 
because I had the game.

09:39.520 --> 09:44.000
When I'm playing, I can tell that 
one of you wants healing,

09:44.540 --> 09:48.610
or one guy who's posted in the back 
wants to be in the front.

09:50.020 --> 09:53.090
Or that she's too shy to say so,

09:53.090 --> 09:56.980
but she wants that bracelet that boosts magic.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.240
That isn't all.

09:59.980 --> 10:02.620
That this guy cares about his comrades.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.630
Or that this guy's scared, but he's 
trying to yell as hard as he can.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.530
Or that someone's tired, but they forced 
themselves to log in anyway.

10:10.530 --> 10:12.820
I can tell...

10:13.700 --> 10:16.500
I really can tell.

10:17.330 --> 10:19.540
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

10:20.060 --> 10:23.520
Elder Tale <i>has taught me many things.</i>

10:25.620 --> 10:27.630
<i>I don't know how other people think.</i>

10:28.230 --> 10:29.760
<i>I'm self-righteous.</i>

10:29.760 --> 10:31.110
<i>Uncaring.</i>

10:31.500 --> 10:33.020
<i>Uncooperative.</i>

10:33.020 --> 10:34.620
<i>I give up too easily.</i>

10:34.620 --> 10:36.080
<i>I can't read moods.</i>

10:36.750 --> 10:39.030
<i>I don't try to get involved with other people.</i>

10:41.810 --> 10:43.430
<i>That's what I was told for so long,</i>

10:43.930 --> 10:46.790
<i>I started to refuse to be with others.</i>

10:48.100 --> 10:51.480
<i>But in </i>Elder Tale<i>, even someone like me</i>

10:51.480 --> 10:54.300
<i>was able to connect with others a little.</i>

10:54.760 --> 10:58.190
<i>And as long as I cared about them,</i>

10:58.190 --> 11:01.330
<i></i>Elder Tale<i> taught me many secrets.</i>

11:02.260 --> 11:04.520
<i>The first thing I learned was teamwork.</i>

11:05.070 --> 11:06.800
<i>Some people did well at it.</i>

11:06.800 --> 11:08.280
<i>Some people did horribly.</i>

11:08.720 --> 11:10.380
<i>Some were talented.</i>

11:10.380 --> 11:11.810
<i>Some sucked.</i>

11:12.750 --> 11:17.030
<i>But what mattered was working with them.</i>

11:17.960 --> 11:19.900
<i>Even when I thought someone was terrible,</i>

11:19.900 --> 11:23.080
<i>sometimes I just didn't understand 
what they were trying to do.</i>

11:23.650 --> 11:26.630
<i>And then I started doing raids.</i>

11:27.480 --> 11:30.650
<i>For some reason, I ended up guild master.</i>

11:31.410 --> 11:33.080
<i>And the next thing I learned was,</i>

11:33.080 --> 11:37.290
<i>strangely, the nights we spent excited over 
stupid stuff were the nights we excelled.</i>

11:38.500 --> 11:41.430
<i>Some of my companions were healthy. 
Some were sick.</i>

11:41.860 --> 11:45.180
<i>And a lot of them had problems, of course.</i>

11:46.130 --> 11:48.930
<i>I learned that all of them were like me.</i>

11:49.680 --> 11:52.180
<i>I started to care about my companions' lives,</i>

11:52.180 --> 11:54.690
<i>and what they wanted me to do.</i>

11:55.280 --> 11:58.360
<i>And I learned to be open-minded and ask others</i>

11:58.360 --> 11:59.940
<i>for their opinions.</i>

12:00.700 --> 12:05.750
<i>That was after my companions had 
learned to deal with my temper.</i>

12:07.840 --> 12:10.420
<i>Most raid guilds don't last long.</i>

12:10.930 --> 12:14.310
<i>Even if you get an item as the result of a raid,</i>

12:14.310 --> 12:16.710
<i>you don't know who it belongs to.</i>

12:17.350 --> 12:20.190
<i>Some members aren't happy with what they get.</i>

12:20.540 --> 12:24.570
<i>Some only care about what's in it for them,
and relationships are ruined.</i>

12:26.110 --> 12:29.800
<i>But we learned to talk with one another.</i>

12:30.460 --> 12:33.680
<i>I told my companions everything honestly,</i>

12:33.680 --> 12:37.480
<i>and they forgave my short temper and trusted me.</i>

12:38.390 --> 12:42.020
<i>And the name, Silver Sword,</i>

12:42.020 --> 12:48.370
<i>spread throughout </i>Elder Tale<i> as one 
of the up-and-coming raid guilds.</i>

12:53.730 --> 12:58.820
So I understand that it feels 
like we're finished now.

12:59.260 --> 13:00.900
Like it's game over.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.510
It feels like this is the real end.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.230
And it may be.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.260
It may be, but...

13:07.570 --> 13:09.440
When I came to this world,

13:09.910 --> 13:11.520
to be honest, I was happy.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.850
You all were a little bit, as well, weren't you?

13:16.430 --> 13:20.230
No one here was one-hundred-percent unhappy, right?

13:21.970 --> 13:25.590
Because... This world is <i>Elder Tale</i>, after all.

13:26.210 --> 13:28.940
The world that we became almost 
stupidly obsessed with.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.810
The world of the raids that we 
were better at than anyone.

13:32.790 --> 13:35.620
Here, we thought, we might be able to make it.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.290
William!

13:37.670 --> 13:38.540
Guild master!

13:39.830 --> 13:40.720
Hey.

13:41.260 --> 13:43.300
But more than any of that,

13:44.100 --> 13:46.320
I was happy to be with you guys.

13:47.010 --> 13:49.130
You were all just like in the game.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.100
I mean, so was I, but...

13:51.720 --> 13:53.180
That doesn't matter, I guess.

13:54.270 --> 13:56.100
We could do raids together.

13:56.590 --> 13:59.600
No one in this world would make fun of us.

14:01.760 --> 14:06.400
But that means that, even if 
we lose, we don't run!

14:06.790 --> 14:08.280
We may not be able to win!

14:08.670 --> 14:10.530
We probably won't.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.290
Odds are, we'll lose.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.510
But we can't run.

14:15.930 --> 14:18.290
There are some things you can't just accept.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.710
Anyway, if we go back, then what?

14:21.710 --> 14:23.050
What would we do?

14:23.570 --> 14:26.300
If you take this from us, what's left?

14:26.960 --> 14:30.800
We played <i>Elder Tale</i> so much that 
others thought we were weird.

14:31.300 --> 14:34.510
I've spent these last two years on <i>Elder Tale</i>.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.510
I thought about it from morning to night.

14:38.190 --> 14:41.310
Eating, sleeping, bathing...

14:41.670 --> 14:43.880
Everything was for that!

14:44.410 --> 14:48.320
Even my studying was for <i>Elder Tale</i>!

14:48.650 --> 14:50.070
Me, too.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.200
If you want to call me a vegetable, go ahead.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.590
I'm a weirdo gamer.

14:56.590 --> 15:00.230
I'm so unsuited for society, 
I can spend a whole evening

15:00.230 --> 15:01.830
overjoyed over a rare item!

15:02.180 --> 15:04.090
That's how serious I've been about this!

15:04.480 --> 15:10.430
But that means that I can't run from 
two or three extra raid bosses.

15:10.430 --> 15:13.070
Even if I ran, where would I go?

15:13.070 --> 15:16.100
Will I run away and spend the rest 
of my life making fun of games?

15:16.940 --> 15:19.250
If I stop raiding, can I make friends?

15:19.580 --> 15:22.890
Can I laugh and say, "Yeah, 
that was a waste of time"?

15:23.360 --> 15:25.360
Screw that crap!

15:25.360 --> 15:27.110
That's insane.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.880
Then you're telling us to keep 
dying instead of running?

15:32.880 --> 15:36.350
How many times do I have to go through that?

15:37.710 --> 15:38.870
Demikas...

15:39.170 --> 15:41.410
If we have some way to win, that's fine.

15:41.950 --> 15:44.810
But we don't. Not anymore.

15:45.330 --> 15:48.880
We're just playing a game.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.330
Even in a different world, that doesn't change.

15:52.330 --> 15:55.380
We're useless mouths to feed.

15:55.940 --> 15:58.890
And we can't even win the game we play.

15:59.680 --> 16:03.020
Will you still tell us not to run?

16:08.630 --> 16:11.530
I ran once...

16:12.640 --> 16:15.700
It was bothering me, but I finally figured it out.

16:16.270 --> 16:20.290
It was the first Round Table 
conference in Akihabara.

16:20.890 --> 16:24.590
Back then, I wanted to do 
raids in this new world

16:24.590 --> 16:26.680
more than anything.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.150
I'm not wasting my time with this.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.070
The safety of the city?

16:31.070 --> 16:32.780
That's stupid.

16:33.190 --> 16:34.930
It's a waste of time.

16:35.780 --> 16:38.300
Honestly, I thought they were fools,

16:38.300 --> 16:41.100
wasting their time on an impossible task.

16:42.290 --> 16:45.660
I did something so horrible that, 
if someone had done it to me,

16:45.660 --> 16:47.250
I would've wanted to punch them.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.220
It's funny.

16:49.220 --> 16:50.640
I know that now.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.950
I ran.

16:52.430 --> 16:54.780
I ignored them because I 
didn't think it would work.

16:55.890 --> 16:59.450
<i>But there was one player who didn't run.</i>

17:00.470 --> 17:01.690
<i>He was</i>

17:02.540 --> 17:04.330
<i>the man I looked up to.</i>

17:05.690 --> 17:09.110
<i>The legendary party who'd gone 
toe-to-toe with the best,</i>

17:09.110 --> 17:12.250
<i>on the toughest quests, without ever 
making a guild of their own.</i>

17:13.460 --> 17:17.140
<i>The Debauchery Tea Party.</i>

17:18.710 --> 17:20.690
<i>When I heard the rumors of them,</i>

17:20.690 --> 17:25.400
<i>I used to dream that, someday, 
they would let me in, too.</i>

17:26.630 --> 17:31.100
<i>But before I hit level 90, they split up.</i>

17:31.680 --> 17:33.580
<i>The members went back to being solo,</i>

17:33.580 --> 17:36.240
<i>without forming a guild, and split up.</i>

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
<i>I didn't understand why they'd left their 
legend if they were just going to quit.</i>

17:43.770 --> 17:48.740
There was a raid that I thought was pointless, 
impossible, and unwinnable, but he...

17:49.770 --> 17:52.710
But Shiroe won it, and made Akihabara.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.120
A raid that created a city!

17:55.120 --> 17:56.630
How can you make fun of that?

17:56.960 --> 17:59.010
I thought he was an incredible leader.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.510
<i>Of course.</i>

18:00.510 --> 18:03.720
<i>I... I looked up to him.</i>

18:04.090 --> 18:05.720
<i>He couldn't just be an ordinary guy.</i>

18:06.170 --> 18:09.020
And when he came to me for a favor,

18:09.020 --> 18:11.500
I was so happy, I agreed instantly.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.840
Of course it would be impossible.

18:14.230 --> 18:16.660
The villain in glasses brought it to me.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.030
Of course something horrible 
would happen to all of us.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.470
He's a nuisance and a sadist. 
You can see it by looking at him.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.190
But I thought it was fun!

18:29.770 --> 18:31.560
I hoped we'd win.

18:32.370 --> 18:33.460
The reason was

18:33.460 --> 18:36.450
because we're gamers, damn it!

18:44.200 --> 18:45.680
Guess I'll try it.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.560
Yeah, I could give it one more go.

19:24.190 --> 19:26.350
<i>I'm seriously an idiot.</i>

19:27.020 --> 19:29.710
<i>But I want to win!</i>

19:30.600 --> 19:32.800
<i>No... I...</i>

19:33.540 --> 19:35.680
<i>I want to give my friends victory!</i>

19:38.630 --> 19:40.630
A guild master, huh?

19:44.630 --> 19:45.740
Hey, Shiro.

19:46.170 --> 19:47.370
You awake?

19:49.250 --> 19:50.000
Yeah.

20:02.010 --> 20:03.550
This is a good guild, isn't it?

20:04.180 --> 20:05.100
Yeah.

20:06.430 --> 20:07.580
<i>Could I...</i>

20:08.210 --> 20:10.270
<i>Could I do that?</i>

20:11.130 --> 20:13.330
<i>If Minori and Tohya were sad...</i>

20:13.330 --> 20:15.330
<i>If Isuzu and Rudy were crying...</i>

20:16.150 --> 20:20.020
<i>Could I cheer them up with 
honest words like that?</i>

20:21.260 --> 20:23.240
<i>If Akatsuki...</i>

20:23.730 --> 20:25.850
Don't worry about anything.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.500
It's my job to protect you.

20:29.940 --> 20:31.520
I want to help them win.

20:32.610 --> 20:34.230
Don't you, Shiroe?

20:34.640 --> 20:36.630
You know just what to say, huh?

20:36.990 --> 20:39.380
I'm a top idol, you know.

20:42.660 --> 20:46.530
So, do you have an idea, strategist?

20:47.070 --> 20:49.390
I need to tell you something, Naotsugu.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.520
You, too, Tetra.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.270
And William. And everyone.

20:55.140 --> 20:57.280
About why we need this raid.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.670
What waits down there.

20:59.670 --> 21:02.270
Why I want the gold.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.720
I should have told you.

21:05.510 --> 21:08.420
I took advantage of you, 
and I tried to do it all myself.

21:09.160 --> 21:12.820
If you'll let me, I have a plan that's a bit better.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.500
But only a bit.

21:15.890 --> 21:17.050
What are our odds?

21:19.430 --> 21:20.670
Fifteen percent.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.050
Good enough for me!

21:23.050 --> 21:24.550
Perfect.

21:24.920 --> 21:28.300
And I need to tell Kinjou and the others, too.

21:28.850 --> 21:30.210
What we want.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.060
About the land of Yamato.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.920
This time, I have to look them 
in the eye and tell them.

21:40.680 --> 21:41.750
See you.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.340
We'll be back as soon as we can.

21:43.700 --> 21:44.820
Good luck.

21:44.820 --> 21:48.080
I'll have some New Year's soup with chicken waiting.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.580
Yeah, it's a promise!

21:50.950 --> 21:53.830
It's been a week since then. 
Everything is ready.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.330
We're about to go to the last battle.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.840
We'll have to get that New Year's 
soba another time.

21:59.380 --> 22:02.840
Tell the chief we'll be back by January 7th.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.880
I need to tell you all something.

22:06.340 --> 22:07.390
Understood.

22:07.900 --> 22:09.850
I'll be waiting, my lord.

22:10.100 --> 22:10.920
Yeah.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.460
I'll come back to everyone.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.730
Let's do this, people!

22:19.110 --> 22:22.230
Let's go plant our flag!

22:26.250 --> 22:27.240
<i>That's right.</i>

22:27.740 --> 22:30.450
<i>I'll return to everyone.</i>

22:31.660 --> 22:32.640
<i>And...</i>

24:06.180 --> 24:08.920
One, two, three, four.

24:09.530 --> 24:10.720
The count sounds.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.430
Three raid bosses.

24:12.430 --> 24:13.680
Preparations are complete.

24:14.030 --> 24:15.180
Weapons in their hands.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.440
Maps in their eyes.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.970
The plan in their heads.

24:18.420 --> 24:20.380
Their odds of winning are fifteen percent.

24:20.580 --> 24:23.650
But their comrades are with them to try again.

24:23.650 --> 24:25.230
Next time: Retry.

24:23.650 --> 24:29.940
<b>Retry</b>

24:25.650 --> 24:27.760
Rise up once more.
