WEBVTT

00:11.750 --> 00:12.583
Come tomorrow,

00:12.959 --> 00:15.750
you will be principal
of North Jackson High School...

00:15.750 --> 00:16.583
for a day.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.750
Lee and I have some issues
to discuss.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.750
I'm getting bombed
with complaints

00:21.750 --> 00:23.125
from frustrated teachers.

00:23.125 --> 00:24.375
Gamby,
what are you doing?

00:24.375 --> 00:26.208
I'm giving the drama teacher
a glass of water--

00:26.208 --> 00:29.083
Actually, can I have
a San Pellegrino? My stomach--

00:30.917 --> 00:32.750
Stay the hell away
from Amanda Snodgrass.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.417
I'm helping Amanda
with her novel.

00:34.417 --> 00:35.959
Brian's gonna promise
you the world

00:35.959 --> 00:37.917
if he thinks he can...
unzip your blouse

00:37.917 --> 00:40.083
and slip-n-slide his privates
all over your lips.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.375
Be a good man.
Don't tell anymore lies.

00:44.375 --> 00:47.083
I'm not that kinda person
anymore, Mom.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.625
(ARGUING)

00:56.375 --> 00:59.750
This patient was flatlining.
Just dead.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.125
And it was like this wave
washed over me,

01:02.125 --> 01:03.583
and then,
everything became so--

01:03.583 --> 01:07.208
You have a little sauce,
right-- You maybe need
a napkin. This side.

01:07.208 --> 01:08.834
Lee?

01:08.834 --> 01:10.166
Christine?

01:10.166 --> 01:12.125
Oh, my goodness,
Kevin Yoon.

01:12.125 --> 01:15.083
Wow, you are
as pretty as ever.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.291
Lee, you look good, too.
What's it been,

01:17.291 --> 01:19.375
almost 20 years?
Yes, must have been.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.625
A long time,
a very long time, Kevin.

01:21.625 --> 01:23.125
You look good.
Oh...

01:23.125 --> 01:24.709
How have you been?

01:24.709 --> 01:26.166
Oh, good. Uh...

01:26.166 --> 01:28.709
As you know, I had a bit
of a rough time in college.

01:28.709 --> 01:30.375
Those, uh, rumors and all.

01:30.375 --> 01:32.834
But after some counseling,
I got my life together,

01:32.834 --> 01:34.792
now I run a bank.
Mm.

01:34.792 --> 01:36.792
Did you two end up married?

01:36.792 --> 01:38.667
Yes. Happily so.

01:38.667 --> 01:39.959
Christine and I
are happily married.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.834
And also really
enjoying our dinner, so,

01:41.834 --> 01:44.834
if you don't mind--
I'm just in town for the week,
then I have to head back

01:44.834 --> 01:46.875
to the wife and kids
in Cincinnati.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.458
Hit me up on Facebook,
we'll catch up.

01:48.458 --> 01:49.417
She doesn't have Facebook.

01:49.417 --> 01:51.166
I do have Facebook.
You do? Yeah?

01:51.166 --> 01:52.709
You're my friend
on Facebook.

01:52.709 --> 01:54.583
You are a lucky man, Lee.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.291
It was so nice
seeing you again, Christine.

01:56.291 --> 01:58.333
So nice to see you.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.333
(scoffs) That mongoloid valet
scratched my fucking dashboard!

02:09.333 --> 02:12.542
I should go get
my tip back. God!

02:12.542 --> 02:14.166
Lee?
Yeah?

02:14.166 --> 02:16.250
In college,
when Kevin and I were dating,

02:16.250 --> 02:18.709
you said he was gay.

02:18.709 --> 02:19.875
Now he's married with kids?

02:19.875 --> 02:22.041
I don't even remember
Kevin all that well.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.375
I didn't--
I didn't say that.

02:23.375 --> 02:24.959
You did say that...

02:24.959 --> 02:26.542
when I told you I loved him.

02:26.542 --> 02:29.041
That's when all those rumors
started circulating.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.000
That's when he dumped me
and left school.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.458
It broke my heart.
Well...

02:32.458 --> 02:35.375
whose shoulder did you come
and cry on when you found out?

02:35.375 --> 02:37.542
Mine, that's who.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.875
Did you start those rumors?

02:40.875 --> 02:42.125
Did I do-- No!

02:42.125 --> 02:45.000
God! What makes you
think it wasn't true?

02:45.000 --> 02:48.208
Lot of straight guys
try dick in college, Christine.

02:48.208 --> 02:50.208
Lucky for us
Kevin went through that phase,

02:50.208 --> 02:53.041
or else you and I never would
have gotten married.

02:53.041 --> 02:56.834
Hey, come on.
Come on. I saved you.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.583
Okay, let's just drop it.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.542

See, I don't understand
why Willows can't be
out here doing this?

03:30.250 --> 03:32.625
You know? I gotta do my job
and his job?

03:32.625 --> 03:33.917
Solve this goddamn murder?

03:33.917 --> 03:35.583
Attempted murder.
Nash...

03:35.583 --> 03:37.458
don't try to lessen
what happened to me, okay?

03:37.458 --> 03:39.542
I'm looking for answers here
and I'm not finding it,

03:39.542 --> 03:40.625
and it's pissing me off.

03:40.625 --> 03:41.709
Now back up there.

03:41.709 --> 03:44.750
Let me take a crack
at your suspects list, huh?

03:44.750 --> 03:47.625
I was a PI in '06,
down in Miami.

03:47.625 --> 03:50.583
Did it for about three months
to pay off some gambling debt.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.041
I know how to work the streets.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.375
I find that
hard to believe.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.625
Oh, ho.
Ooh.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.875
What's up, y'all?
Making cat's cradles?

03:56.875 --> 03:58.125
No, we're not
making cat's cradles.

03:58.125 --> 04:00.125
We're reenacting
bullet trajectories.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.625
Gamby knows his shit.

04:01.625 --> 04:04.542
I know he does.
He knows my shit, too.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.291
Hey, hey, uh-uh.
Stop, that's morbid.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.500
These are deadly bullets,
don't put it down
in your privates.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.625
Please, I take deadly bullets
there real good.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.667
Pew, pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew, pew...

04:13.667 --> 04:14.875
Stop.
Give me some bullets.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.250
Pew, pew, pew, pew--
Give me my yarn.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.834
Can I help you
with something?

04:18.834 --> 04:21.083
Yeah, I'm just
wondering if you're going
to Lee's birthday party?

04:21.083 --> 04:23.083
Duh, I'm his best friend.
Of course I'm going.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.792
Do you want to, maybe,
go together?

04:24.792 --> 04:27.959
Uh, well, bosses and teachers
aren't allowed to go
to parties together.

04:27.959 --> 04:29.000
It's against school policy.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.125
Is it?
Yes, it is, Nash, shut up.

04:31.125 --> 04:35.166
Well, you never thought that
before when we... (mouths word)

04:35.166 --> 04:36.917
Well, I made a lot
of mistakes last semester

04:36.917 --> 04:39.208
and I'm not trying
to remake those mistakes.

04:39.208 --> 04:42.208
Well, if I show up there,
will you talk to me?

04:42.208 --> 04:44.166
Yeah, I mean, if there's
something to talk about.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.834
Yeah? There will be
stuff to talk about.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.041
So, I accept.

04:47.041 --> 04:49.834
And my bullet catcher
accepts too.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.375
I'm not really presenting
you anything to accept,

04:53.375 --> 04:54.542
so I don't owe
you anything.

04:54.542 --> 04:57.208
Yeah, I know you don't.
Of course not.

04:58.875 --> 05:02.041
She seems freaking
cuckoo beans.

05:02.041 --> 05:04.375
But her body is kind of rockin'.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.583
You could do worse.

05:06.583 --> 05:07.875
I'd fuck her.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.875
Well, then you fuck her.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.250
I got other plans.

05:12.542 --> 05:13.917
Hey, Swift,
take a hike.

05:13.917 --> 05:16.000
Uh, actually, we're in
the middle of a conversation.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.458
I know, I was just kidding.
Come on, lighten up, Swift.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.208
(laughing)

05:20.208 --> 05:22.083
But seriously, could you
meander away for a moment?

05:22.083 --> 05:23.458
I just wanted to see...
(muttering)

05:23.458 --> 05:24.875
Oh, yeah. Okay.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.083
I'll tell you how it goes.
Okay.

05:27.959 --> 05:30.041
I like her.
She's a good egg.

05:30.041 --> 05:34.250
You going to, uh, Lee Russell's
birthday bash celebration?

05:34.250 --> 05:36.417
Oof, I don't want to go,
to be honest,

05:36.417 --> 05:39.583
but, um, I have a feeling,
he's gonna keep count
and punish me if I don't.

05:39.583 --> 05:40.875
He will.
Mm-hmm.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.625
He's creepy. So, um...

05:42.625 --> 05:44.375
yeah, Brian and I
will be there

05:44.375 --> 05:47.083
once he's finished volunteering
at the boys rec center.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.083
Volunteering?
Yup.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.959
Every Friday
and every second Wednesday.

05:51.959 --> 05:54.417
(scoffs)
It's amusing how people
try so hard sometimes,

05:54.417 --> 05:56.291
but it just comes off
as pathetic.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.083
It's not pathetic at all.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.834
He's giving much-needed
guidance to kids who have
no one else to look up to.

06:00.834 --> 06:04.083
You know, some people
work with children
on a full-time basis

06:04.083 --> 06:06.542
and they don't
feel the need to write
a fucking book about it.

06:06.542 --> 06:07.917
He keeps you
on a pretty tight leash.

06:07.917 --> 06:09.792
You know he does that
because he's insecure

06:09.792 --> 06:11.250
with you being
faithful in the relationship.

06:11.250 --> 06:14.291
Oh, no, no.
He's, uh... he's very secure.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.500
Are you sure about that?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.417
Yeah. He has
nothing to worry about.

06:17.417 --> 06:19.750
Yuck. Don't you have
a class to teach or something?

06:19.750 --> 06:21.125
I do.
Yeah, go to class.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.792
Yeah. I'll see you
at the party.

06:22.792 --> 06:24.083
Eh, maybe you will,
maybe you won't.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.291
I mean, if you go to the party,
you'll probably see me

06:26.291 --> 06:27.959
because I'm gonna be there.

06:27.959 --> 06:30.583
But it could be super crowded
and busy, and if you don't
go with the person,

06:30.583 --> 06:32.959
you might not even get
to speak with them there,
so, you never know.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.333
I will see you, then.
Lot of mingling.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.709
Tons of mingling.

06:36.709 --> 06:39.125
Whoo! You want
to see a master?

06:39.125 --> 06:41.542
Watch me work the room
at my birthday party.

06:41.542 --> 06:43.291
Guess who RSVP'd?

06:43.291 --> 06:45.959
Who?
Superintendent Haas.

06:45.959 --> 06:47.208
Oh, congratulations.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.500
The guest list
is really shaping up, huh?

06:49.500 --> 06:50.959
Watch my shit.
Get it on.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.250
Watch my shit.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.750
Look at my shit.
What am I looking at?

06:53.750 --> 06:56.208
Everybody's gonna be
at this motherfucker.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.917
You bringing a hot date?

06:57.917 --> 06:59.500
No, I'm not bringing a date.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.834
You need to bring
a hot-ass woman.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.375
Show Snodgrass you're over it.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.875
You're supposed to be
making her jealous.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.125
That is Relationship 101.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.291
I have a master plan.

07:09.291 --> 07:11.000
She used to have
feelings for me.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
If I can show her
I'm a charitable man,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.417
not just Brian,
maybe I can remind her.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.500
You know
jackshit about women.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.291
♪ ♪

07:20.291 --> 07:23.333
Fuckwads, leave now.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.667
Not you, Tom Cruise.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.000
What do you want?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.333
I want you to be my plus one
to Lee Russell's birthday party.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.417
Fuck no.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.542
Well, too bad,
it's mandatory, you're going.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.208
And once you're there,
you're gonna show everyone

07:34.208 --> 07:35.834
what a positive impact
I've had on your life

07:35.834 --> 07:37.291
and how I've made you
a better human being.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.750
But you haven't
done any of that,

07:38.750 --> 07:40.542
and I don't want to go
to your stupid pedo party.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.000
And it's outside
of school, too,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.417
so you can't even
make me go to that.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.875
(babbling)

07:45.875 --> 07:47.208
What if I paid you $200?

07:47.208 --> 07:48.542
I want 1,000.

07:48.542 --> 07:50.333
Now I know
you're smoking DMT.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.375
$320.

07:51.375 --> 07:52.375
No, 700.

07:52.375 --> 07:53.500
You're a whore.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.709
$500. Final offer.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.250
All right, I'll go.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.375
Cool, but know this.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.417
You will not get
one red cent of that money

08:01.417 --> 08:03.709
if you make me look
like a fool, do you hear me?

08:03.709 --> 08:05.625
You will be polite,
you will be cordial,

08:05.625 --> 08:07.875
and you will also...

08:09.166 --> 08:10.291
wear this,

08:10.291 --> 08:11.917
tucked into your trousers.

08:11.917 --> 08:13.375
Do I make myself clear?

08:13.375 --> 08:14.959
Yeah.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.709
I'll pick you up
at your mom's.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.250
Hi.

08:19.250 --> 08:22.500
Russell:
Mi-Cha! Show these gents
where the cake goes! Okay?

08:22.500 --> 08:25.417
(speaking Korean)
Hey, how we getting
paid for this, man?

08:25.417 --> 08:28.417
Motherfucker, you on salary,
you already getting paid
for this.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.542
It's a bowel movement.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.291
I should have said something.

25:46.291 --> 25:48.125
He was pretty rude to you.

25:48.125 --> 25:51.000
And it's not nice to be accused
of doing something like that.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.750
I don't give a fuck.

25:52.750 --> 25:55.333
Well, you should.

25:55.333 --> 25:58.083
I suppose there's a lesson
to be learned in this anyhow.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.458
If you walk around dressed

25:59.458 --> 26:01.667
like the type of person that
would take a shit on something,

26:01.667 --> 26:05.375
don't be surprised if somebody
accuses you of doing it.

26:05.375 --> 26:06.792
Hmm.

26:09.834 --> 26:12.291
All right, you did good.

26:12.291 --> 26:13.709
As promised, there you go.

26:13.709 --> 26:15.458
500 big ones.

26:15.458 --> 26:17.583
Don't spend it all
in one place.

26:23.250 --> 26:24.291
Oof. (clears throat)

26:24.291 --> 26:25.750
"Oof?"
What's going on?

26:25.750 --> 26:26.875
Why are you
making those noises?

26:26.875 --> 26:29.041
I don't feel good.
Are you gonna throw up?

26:29.041 --> 26:30.375
I don't know.

26:30.375 --> 26:32.250
Go out--
Roll the window down
if you're gonna do it.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.500
Go over there!

26:33.500 --> 26:35.417
Do it out there!
Don't do it inside
my Silverado.

26:35.417 --> 26:37.041
Roll down the window,
roll it down!

26:37.041 --> 26:38.458
Roll it down!

26:38.458 --> 26:40.375
(retching)

26:44.000 --> 26:45.458
(clears throat)

26:45.458 --> 26:47.000
Sickening.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.667
Did you get it
all out of you?

26:50.834 --> 26:52.458
There might be
a little more later.

26:52.458 --> 26:54.834
Then do it out the window.
Don't fuck around in here.

26:54.834 --> 26:57.625
Were you just paying that boy?

26:59.542 --> 27:02.875
That money was for books.
I also buy his family groceries.

27:04.834 --> 27:06.834
Did you like my little present?

27:06.834 --> 27:09.250
Present, what the fuck
you talking about?

27:09.250 --> 27:11.083
I'm talking about Brian.

27:11.083 --> 27:12.208
(giggles)

27:12.208 --> 27:15.041
I made him look
like a fucking fool for you.

27:15.041 --> 27:16.375
I roofied his drink.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.250
You did what?

27:18.250 --> 27:20.583
(giggles)
I roofied his drink.

27:20.583 --> 27:21.667
You drugged him?

27:23.208 --> 27:24.583
You could have killed him!

27:24.583 --> 27:26.375
Mm-hmm.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.375
Thank you.

27:29.375 --> 27:32.041
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.417
You're welcome.

27:33.417 --> 27:35.083
He did look
like a bitch, didn't he?

27:35.083 --> 27:36.375
(laughs) Yes.

27:36.375 --> 27:38.000
He just fucking fell down.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
(both laughing)

27:43.375 --> 27:45.875
Just like, in the middle of
running his fucking mouth,

27:45.875 --> 27:48.375
just, "bloop."
I kept trying not to laugh.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.000
But I was just like,
"Look at this old motherfucker

27:51.000 --> 27:52.750
who just had a heart attack."

27:55.083 --> 27:57.917
They had to carry
that motherfucker out of there.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.917
I was like,
"Night-night, baby."

28:02.917 --> 28:04.917
Hey, thank you.

28:09.041 --> 28:10.667
You wanna go back to my place?

28:10.667 --> 28:12.375
Yep.

28:12.375 --> 28:14.792
It's like an hour away,
so it's a bit of a drive.

28:14.792 --> 28:15.917
