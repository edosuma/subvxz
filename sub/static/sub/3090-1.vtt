01:23.256 --> 01:27.299
I fled him down the nights
and down the days.

01:27.399 --> 01:31.443
I fled him down the arches of the years.

01:31.743 --> 01:36.748
I fled him down the labyrinthine ways
of my own mind.

01:36.848 --> 01:41.324
And in the mist of tears,
I hid from him,

01:41.424 --> 01:45.088
and under running laughter.

01:59.838 --> 02:01.273
Come on, Darcy!

02:01.573 --> 02:06.175
- Come on, babe, let's go for it!
- Go for it, Mom, go for it!

02:12.451 --> 02:16.719
Is she hot or what?
For an older chick, I mean.

02:17.589 --> 02:20.090
You talk too much.

02:22.261 --> 02:24.282
What can I get for you?

02:34.539 --> 02:37.577
So, what's up
with the advertising genius?

02:38.677 --> 02:41.813
- We got our first client last week.
- Wonderful!

02:41.913 --> 02:44.316
Yeah, it's the biggest car dealership
in Cleveland.

02:44.416 --> 02:47.219
They want a new approach.
Something that skews younger, so...

02:47.319 --> 02:49.755
- You waited all night to tell us this?
- I'm sorry.

02:49.855 --> 02:51.089
Ben, wonderful!

02:51.189 --> 02:56.028
That's amazing.
That's amazing, you two kids...

02:56.628 --> 02:58.397
I mean three kids.

02:58.497 --> 03:02.466
Just coming all this way just to party
with the old folks. It's just...

03:06.037 --> 03:08.104
Mom, are you okay?

03:09.507 --> 03:14.144
I'm sorry, just... I think I do need
to go powder my nose after all.

03:25.023 --> 03:28.961
You're the best. You're so lucky.

03:29.361 --> 03:31.963
Got a good man, good...

03:32.063 --> 03:34.833
couple of kids,
and you even still got your figure.

03:34.933 --> 03:39.004
Your figure is fine, Betty.
Bob certainly noticed.

03:39.104 --> 03:42.073
My mother would say,
"Count your blessings, babe."

03:42.273 --> 03:45.243
Oh, I do. I do.

03:45.343 --> 03:48.613
You know that guy Beadie?
Over in New Hampshire?

03:48.713 --> 03:52.684
He got another one.
A gay divorcee, like me.

03:52.784 --> 03:54.753
- What do you mean? The...
- Yeah.

03:54.853 --> 03:57.906
The news anchor on channel eight?
You know, the really cute one?

03:58.006 --> 04:00.194
He said it makes it an even dozen.

04:03.395 --> 04:05.929
She was tortured.

04:07.732 --> 04:10.435
I don't know what I'm talking about.

04:10.535 --> 04:12.304
- I'm drunk.
- That's okay.

04:12.404 --> 04:14.473
- Go back to your family.
- Okay, are you okay?

04:14.573 --> 04:17.475
Yeah. I just need a little
more time by myself.

04:17.575 --> 04:20.476
Alright, I'll see you later. Okay.

04:28.253 --> 04:32.003
I was going to save
this until later, but...

04:33.792 --> 04:36.458
Happy anniversary, Mrs. Anderson.

04:40.301 --> 04:41.767
You're a Pisces.

04:41.867 --> 04:45.570
Oh, my God, Bobby, they're beautiful!

04:45.670 --> 04:47.904
They're beautiful, thank you.

04:50.841 --> 04:55.508
Hey, hey, hey, cut it out.
Just save that for later. Save it for later.

04:59.050 --> 05:01.051
Let me try them on.

05:09.661 --> 05:12.965
There. Now, how do they look?

05:14.265 --> 05:16.699
They were made for you, hon.

05:19.070 --> 05:20.182
- Would you hold that?
- Yes.

05:20.282 --> 05:22.784
And we'd better get back in there.
They're gonna think we got a room.

05:24.409 --> 05:26.510
Honestly speaking, I wouldn't mind.

05:28.013 --> 05:30.974
Alright, ladies and germs,

05:31.074 --> 05:35.685
what we have here is the best accountant
in our little company.

05:37.355 --> 05:39.725
In the same vein...

05:40.125 --> 05:44.429
Best damn accountant in the US of A!

05:44.529 --> 05:48.355
And you want to know why? You want
to know why? Because he's careful...

05:48.455 --> 05:51.570
Okay, because he checks his work...

05:51.870 --> 05:54.707
And look out IRS,
because when he has to,

05:55.228 --> 05:57.338
he covers his tracks.

05:58.576 --> 06:00.311
Enjoy!

06:00.512 --> 06:02.315
Thank you for this.

06:04.449 --> 06:07.552
Hi. I just wanted to thank everybody
for coming tonight,

06:07.652 --> 06:10.498
and just take a minute of your time.

06:10.598 --> 06:12.323
When Donnie and I decided
to have this party,

06:12.423 --> 06:14.926
it was really as a way of saying
thank you to our parents.

06:15.326 --> 06:19.196
For your love and support and for
putting up with us for the past 25 years.

06:20.232 --> 06:22.668
But really, to thank them for their love

06:22.768 --> 06:25.967
and their respect
and their devotion to each other.

06:26.671 --> 06:31.476
Through hard work
and a little help from their kids...

06:31.576 --> 06:33.912
and lots of love.

06:34.012 --> 06:37.503
My parents have created
something very rare.

06:37.603 --> 06:39.750
A good marriage.

06:39.850 --> 06:41.417
We love you guys.

06:43.188 --> 06:46.729
- Well, got the house to ourselves.
- Yes.

06:46.829 --> 06:48.658
We do.

06:50.194 --> 06:51.563
Am I gonna get lucky tonight?

06:51.663 --> 06:54.766
Well, if you bring me
some fizzy water...

06:54.866 --> 06:57.068
to settle my stomach a little.

06:57.168 --> 06:59.204
You just might.

06:59.304 --> 07:04.171
- Oh, I want you to be on top.
- Well, we'll see.

07:42.914 --> 07:45.016
Here I come, ready or not!

07:45.116 --> 07:47.750
Yeah, well hopefully we both will.

07:53.074 --> 07:55.491
Thank you.

07:59.060 --> 08:01.371
Thank you.

08:09.374 --> 08:10.815
Bob...

08:13.878 --> 08:16.733
Are you my bad, bad girl?

08:17.033 --> 08:21.119
- Are you my naughty boy?
- I am. I can't help it.

08:21.219 --> 08:25.056
I'm powerless over my nature.

08:25.156 --> 08:28.359
I hope you're not powerless
over the long list of honeydews

08:28.459 --> 08:31.850
I have for year 26, Mr. Anderson.

08:42.674 --> 08:45.609
Come on over here,
you naughty little boy.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.528
That was terrific.

10:10.628 --> 10:12.057
Good.

10:12.157 --> 10:15.433
Happy anniversary,
you naughty little boy.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.067
Yay!

10:27.812 --> 10:29.787
Okay.

10:33.785 --> 10:37.355
A 1955 double-dye wheat penny.

10:37.755 --> 10:40.625
Robert Anderson's great white whale.

10:40.725 --> 10:44.181
Christ. Is that uncirculated?

10:44.281 --> 10:48.200
No, but better than good.
I'd call it VG.

10:48.300 --> 10:52.003
I found it on yesterday's pennies
from heaven blog.

10:52.103 --> 10:56.707
The guy who owns it has it listed for like,
I don't know, $15,000, which is ridiculous,

10:56.807 --> 10:59.297
but I think I could get it for 9.

11:01.212 --> 11:04.472
Let me buy it for you.
Let me, an anniversary present.

11:04.572 --> 11:07.118
- Like your fish earrings. Yes!
- No... No, no, no, no.

11:07.218 --> 11:11.189
- Those fish earrings didn't cost $9,000.
- No, I know, but I want to.

11:11.289 --> 11:13.324
Oh, no...

11:13.424 --> 11:18.796
It's not the... look... look,
if I find it, then it's...

11:18.896 --> 11:22.900
- Then it's fate, it's karma.
- I know, I know, but...

11:23.000 --> 11:26.905
I just thought, you know,
it's our anniversary, and it's special...

11:27.005 --> 11:31.442
But maybe... going once,
going twice...

11:31.542 --> 11:34.418
I'm sure that one day...

11:34.518 --> 11:38.950
I will find one in my change.
Until then...

11:39.350 --> 11:44.222
- Yes, you enjoy the hunt.
- Yes, I enjoy the hunt.

11:44.322 --> 11:46.891
Okay. Alright.

11:50.219 --> 11:53.631
- Great. They're home.
- Oh, you're such a mom.

11:53.731 --> 11:56.933
I know I am.
I'm just powerless over my nature.

12:00.404 --> 12:02.150
Does an accountant ever eat
a good breakfast?

12:02.450 --> 12:05.410
- Good shot Ma.
- Don't say "Ma." It sounds so ignorant.

12:05.610 --> 12:07.478
Ma!

12:07.778 --> 12:11.582
Ma Ray, Ma Barker, Ma Jug,
you went out last night Ma!

12:13.084 --> 12:15.386
Always blame the woman!

12:15.486 --> 12:18.456
Well, as James Jones
says in "from here to eternity,

12:18.556 --> 12:20.858
"God dealt women all the best the cards.

12:20.958 --> 12:23.461
- Right between the legs."
- Sexist crap!

12:23.561 --> 12:27.265
- Daddy, I can't believe you said that!
- Daddy, it sounds so ignorant!

12:27.365 --> 12:28.833
- Bad dad.
- Stop it, stop it.

12:28.933 --> 12:32.503
- So when will you be back?
- It depends on the traffic.

12:32.603 --> 12:35.256
I have to drop in on the famous
Mr. Gaines before I leave.

12:35.356 --> 12:37.925
You're not crazy about my...

12:38.025 --> 12:41.613
secondary career
as a kingpin collector...

12:42.413 --> 12:44.882
But I am the best accountant
in the firm.

12:44.982 --> 12:46.985
- Yeah, no conceit in our family.
- No.

12:47.285 --> 12:49.687
Don't forget to thank him
for the tasteful toilet seat.

12:49.787 --> 12:53.524
Will do. Right after I ask him
for a corner office with an ocean view.

12:53.624 --> 12:55.977
- Oh, you're bad. You're bad. Goodbye.
- Bye.

12:56.077 --> 12:59.998
- You take good care of my baby.
- Oh, you bet I will, Ma.

13:00.498 --> 13:02.733
- Love you.
- I love you.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.669
- Drive safe.
- I will, I always do.

13:04.769 --> 13:06.835
Don't miss your flight.

13:08.306 --> 13:10.014
Bye!

13:10.675 --> 13:13.809
- Call me! Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

13:46.377 --> 13:47.979
<i>...and although police
refuse to comment,</i>

13:48.079 --> 13:52.375
<i>sources close to the investigation confirm
that elements of the crime suggest</i>

13:52.475 --> 13:56.755
<i>that it was the work of the notorious
serial killer who calls himself "Beadie."</i>

13:57.455 --> 14:00.130
<i>Yes, that's right Dave.
Marjorie Duvall moved here</i>

14:00.230 --> 14:02.587
<i>to the picturesque town of South Gansett,
New Hampshire</i>

14:02.687 --> 14:04.595
<i>after her divorce five years ago.</i>

14:04.695 --> 14:08.733
<i>Co-workers reported her missing last Wednesday
after she failed to show up for work.</i>

14:08.833 --> 14:12.355
<i>Ms. Duvall's body was discovered
early this morning by a jogger</i>

14:12.455 --> 14:17.408
<i>in this remote area of the abandoned
South Gansett railway station.</i>

14:17.508 --> 14:20.944
<i>If this was, in fact the work
of the notorious serial killer,</i>

14:21.044 --> 14:24.579
<i>police can soon expect to receive
Ms. Duvall's identification cards,</i>

14:24.679 --> 14:28.019
<i>along with a taunting note
from Beadie in the mail.</i>

14:28.119 --> 14:31.221
<i>About a dozen downtown businesses
were boarded up Wednesday,</i>

14:31.321 --> 14:34.524
<i>and glass littered sidewalks
following two nights of protests</i>

14:34.624 --> 14:37.061
<i>over the police shooting
of an unarmed black man.</i>

14:37.161 --> 14:40.365
<i>There were few people
on the streets as the arch diocese</i>

14:40.465 --> 14:44.023
<i>cancelled classes in two inner-city
Roman catholic schools.</i>

14:44.123 --> 14:48.411
<i>Police urged curiosity seekers
to stay out of the...</i>

15:00.351 --> 15:05.256
<i>And me and mine have cleared
a straight path for you.</i>

15:07.458 --> 15:08.877
<i>Aim here.</i>

15:10.761 --> 15:12.864
<i>For the center.</i>

15:13.364 --> 15:14.722
Oh, no. No.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.695
Oh, come on.

15:19.232 --> 15:21.070
Poop!

15:50.334 --> 15:53.636
Yes, he goes,
but he never really leaves.

16:00.978 --> 16:02.911
Let's see here...

17:31.035 --> 17:34.069
These are mine! I was looking for these.

17:53.357 --> 17:55.608
Male expiration.

19:24.548 --> 19:27.965
Shit. Shit!

19:43.901 --> 19:48.236
That makes an even dozen.
She was tortured.

20:04.755 --> 20:06.756
Oh, my God.

20:08.158 --> 20:10.893
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

22:07.560 --> 22:09.901
<i>- Hi, this is Darcy.
- And this is Bob.</i>

22:10.001 --> 22:13.117
<i>We're not able to come to the phone right now,
but leave a message if you want to.</i>

22:13.217 --> 22:16.320
<i>And if it's about collectible coins,
make sure you leave a message.</i>

22:16.420 --> 22:19.423
<i>Remember, change comes from within!</i>

22:22.760 --> 22:25.238
If that's you handsome...

22:25.738 --> 22:29.499
get your tight little buns over here.
My... my husband's out of town.

22:30.361 --> 22:33.070
Very funny. I tried you before.

22:33.570 --> 22:36.106
I was on the phone with Pets.

22:36.206 --> 22:41.345
You know, she got home fine, and...
and Donnie did too. It's just... and she's...

22:41.445 --> 22:46.016
just going crazy over those,
bridesmaid's dresses.

22:46.316 --> 22:48.185
You okay?

22:48.554 --> 22:51.989
Well, to quote the famous
Robert Anderson I'm...

22:52.089 --> 22:55.659
upright and sniffing the air.
How did it go today?

22:55.759 --> 22:58.629
Well, I picked up
17 lady liberties at a good...

23:00.022 --> 23:02.299
<i>no, at a great price.</i>

23:02.399 --> 23:05.269
<i>As for that idiot's taxes,
the less said the better.</i>

23:05.369 --> 23:07.738
Oh, dear.

23:07.838 --> 23:11.676
Your voice sounds thick.
You haven't been crying have you?

23:13.377 --> 23:16.080
Well, I just, you know...

23:16.480 --> 23:21.318
After I talked with Pets, I just...
I started thinking about my... my sister.

23:21.418 --> 23:24.121
You know, she was a year younger...

23:24.721 --> 23:27.290
than Pets when she died.

23:28.926 --> 23:32.229
Well, honey, if I jump in the car
and turn around, I can be home in no time.

23:32.529 --> 23:36.188
No, no, no, no. Don't do that. I...

23:36.288 --> 23:39.703
after the day you've put in,
it's just a...

23:39.803 --> 23:44.141
I'd be worried you'd fall asleep
behind the wheel.

23:45.042 --> 23:47.076
<i>Are you sure?</i>

23:47.577 --> 23:50.563
Yeah, I'm sure. In fact...

23:50.963 --> 23:53.951
did I... since you're in Vermont anyway,

23:54.051 --> 23:58.555
Did I... did I mention that...
estate sale in Rutland?

23:58.655 --> 24:01.659
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I checked it online back at the motel.</i>

24:01.759 --> 24:04.461
Lot 75 steel pennies.

24:04.561 --> 24:06.679
I mean... Look,

24:06.779 --> 24:10.501
if you're okay and I can square it with
Gaines, do you mind if I stay another day?

24:11.702 --> 24:13.550
More time for me and the pool boy.

24:15.506 --> 24:19.643
- Well, lock up tight.
- Always.

24:19.743 --> 24:22.813
<i>I know you loved your sister, honey.</i>

24:23.113 --> 24:26.276
Yes. Yes, I did.

24:27.084 --> 24:30.620
- And I love you.
- I love you.

25:21.839 --> 25:24.005
Beadie...

28:10.040 --> 28:14.460
<i>Incredible as it may seem, Beadie has been
living on this suburban Cleaves Mills street</i>

28:14.560 --> 28:19.299
<i>since the late 1980s,
with his wife of 25 years and two children,</i>

28:19.429 --> 28:22.442
<i>who are just now finding out
that they have grown up under the shadow</i>

28:22.642 --> 28:26.273
<i>of New England's most notorious killer.
Or so they claim.</i>

28:26.373 --> 28:28.817
<i>Many are asking how much
Darcelene Anderson knew</i>

28:28.917 --> 28:32.160
<i>about her husband's
other life as Beadie.</i>

28:33.797 --> 28:36.305
She knew nothing!

30:25.809 --> 30:28.645
Ask yourself if you really need
one of these tonight.

30:28.845 --> 30:32.383
Yeah, well, I think tonight I do.

31:24.134 --> 31:27.201
You just had had to fucking look,
didn't you?

31:50.627 --> 31:52.062
Any more coffee, darling?

31:52.662 --> 31:55.373
Yeah, sure. Just a half a cup.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.560
You know what, forget about that coffee.

32:23.660 --> 32:26.963
It'll just keep me up anyway.
Just the check please.

32:27.364 --> 32:28.656
Comin' up.

32:55.725 --> 32:58.723
A slut reading a slutty novel.

34:38.295 --> 34:39.828
No...

36:09.219 --> 36:10.892
Hi.

36:12.789 --> 36:15.425
- You've been cheating at the candy again.
- Oh, my...

36:15.525 --> 36:17.594
Jesus, you scared the life out of me.

36:17.694 --> 36:20.476
As Moses said to the children of Israel,

36:20.576 --> 36:24.802
"what goeth in the mouth today,
is showeth in the butt tomorrow."

36:25.702 --> 36:27.634
Bob...

36:28.137 --> 36:31.141
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in Vermont.

36:31.341 --> 36:33.889
- We need to talk.
- What?

36:35.345 --> 36:40.150
You come sneaking in here at 3:30
in the morning because we need to talk?

36:40.550 --> 36:46.122
I lay for a while in that stupid motel.

36:47.123 --> 36:49.334
After we talked.

36:49.792 --> 36:52.195
And then I went out
for something to eat,

36:52.295 --> 36:57.338
all the while trying
to convince myself that...

36:57.438 --> 37:01.637
what I was thinking wasn't true.

37:01.738 --> 37:06.709
But I didn't get to where I got
by dodging the truth, so,

37:06.809 --> 37:10.580
I jumped in the blazer
and I hit the road.

37:10.680 --> 37:13.216
Really? Gosh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:13.316 --> 37:17.038
I really... I just don't have a clue.
It's and as for the candy,

37:17.138 --> 37:19.722
you know people in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

37:19.822 --> 37:24.761
Well, there you go with your passive
aggressive stuff again. You never change.

37:24.861 --> 37:27.874
I can read you like a book, honey.

37:28.364 --> 37:30.566
You're upset.

37:31.567 --> 37:34.136
And it's my fault.

37:34.837 --> 37:38.307
And I'm sorry from the bottom
of my heart.

37:39.108 --> 37:42.487
You found my secret hiding place
in the garage.

37:42.812 --> 37:45.348
I really have n... absolutely no idea.
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:45.448 --> 37:49.050
You did a great job putting everything
back where it belonged,

37:49.150 --> 37:54.991
except the box was a little to the left
of where I usually put it.

37:55.091 --> 37:59.228
And I love that box, because,
you know, Petra... Petra gave it to me.

37:59.829 --> 38:02.665
And there was a rubber band missing.

38:02.765 --> 38:07.804
Beadie always uses two rubber bands.

38:09.338 --> 38:12.141
Belt and suspender rule.

38:12.909 --> 38:15.878
But... I found it.

38:17.113 --> 38:21.451
Under your car. Which, by the way,
needs an oil change, which you always forget.

38:21.551 --> 38:25.021
Sometimes you can be so smart
about some things.

38:25.121 --> 38:27.891
And so dumb about others.

38:27.991 --> 38:30.760
Like clearing the search history.

38:30.860 --> 38:33.315
You always forget to do it.

38:34.397 --> 38:37.200
- What?
- The search history.

38:37.300 --> 38:40.465
It's the first thing I checked
when I came in.

38:40.565 --> 38:42.990
And... Okay,

38:43.090 --> 38:44.807
I admit it.

38:44.907 --> 38:49.178
I had a pudding cup. So I guess I am
a person that lives in a glass house.

38:49.278 --> 38:53.881
Really, you checked my computer?
You dirty sneak!

38:55.885 --> 39:00.389
Darc, I've been doing it for years.

39:03.026 --> 39:08.565
I have a very bad friend
that does very bad things,

39:08.665 --> 39:11.635
and when you're a man
in that position...

39:13.636 --> 39:17.874
You have to stay current
on those closest to you.

39:18.074 --> 39:22.458
And since the kids left home,
that would be you.

39:22.745 --> 39:25.615
And you haven't just been checking
on Marjorie Duvall.

39:25.715 --> 39:29.951
You've been checking
on all of them. Whoops!

39:30.887 --> 39:35.625
Who's... bad friend?
What... what bad friend?

39:35.725 --> 39:37.860
The kid I chummed around
in junior high with.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.104
I told you about him
after we were married.

39:42.165 --> 39:45.468
- Yeah, but he's d...
- Dead, yeah.

39:45.568 --> 39:50.540
Got hit by a truck chasing a baseball
onto the street. Poor old Brian.

39:50.940 --> 39:55.547
You're not making sense, Bob.

39:58.047 --> 40:00.684
I guess you'd have to be there.

40:01.084 --> 40:03.622
There were these girls

40:03.722 --> 40:06.754
that snooted us in the 8th grade.

40:07.256 --> 40:11.157
Diane Ramage. Laurie Svensen.

40:11.257 --> 40:13.096
And a couple of others.

40:13.196 --> 40:17.166
Anyway, Brian came up with this idea
that we would catch one of them alone.

40:17.266 --> 40:20.603
Well, maybe two. One for each of us.

40:21.003 --> 40:24.240
We were going to say to them...

40:24.340 --> 40:29.078
that if they fucked us real good like they
fucked their boyfriends on Saturday night,

40:29.178 --> 40:31.615
we'd let them live.

40:33.416 --> 40:35.752
And this was...

40:35.852 --> 40:37.920
this was all your friend Brian's idea?

40:38.020 --> 40:39.289
Well...

40:40.189 --> 40:41.737
Look,

40:41.837 --> 40:44.716
those girls were snoots.

40:44.816 --> 40:46.462
Like... like... like Betty next door.

40:46.562 --> 40:50.433
Did you see the way that she was running
her tits all over me at the party?

40:50.733 --> 40:52.724
Well, yeah, she was drunk.

40:54.070 --> 40:56.105
Yeah.

40:56.205 --> 40:59.709
But, Darcy, you have to realize that...

41:01.010 --> 41:02.688
I didn't kill those women.

41:04.313 --> 41:06.482
Not really.

41:06.582 --> 41:10.253
It was another person inside my head.

41:10.353 --> 41:12.791
I fought it

41:12.891 --> 41:16.189
for years, the voice.

41:17.126 --> 41:20.243
And then I just...

41:22.098 --> 41:24.901
I just thought, I'll do it, once.

41:25.001 --> 41:27.470
Get it out of my head.
If I get caught, I get caught.

41:27.570 --> 41:31.908
At least, at least it won't be
in my head anymore.

41:32.608 --> 41:35.445
Won't have to think about it,
wonder what it would be like.

41:35.545 --> 41:40.516
All these years,
you've been fighting him.

41:40.616 --> 41:43.419
Is that right? The Beadie inside you?

41:43.519 --> 41:48.139
Yeah, yeah. I have,
and I could fight him forever if...

41:48.239 --> 41:51.761
if I thought that there was
a future for us.

41:51.861 --> 41:55.164
If there was some way
that we could, you know, just...

41:55.264 --> 41:57.442
turn the page.

41:59.435 --> 42:01.604
Well, if I don't...

42:02.505 --> 42:06.843
I suppose that I become Beadie's next.

42:06.943 --> 42:08.580
Oh, Darcy, come on.

42:11.080 --> 42:15.017
Honey, this is not some...
some movie where the psycho husband

42:15.117 --> 42:17.987
chases the screaming wife
around the house.

42:18.087 --> 42:20.581
I would never let Beadie hurt you.

42:21.224 --> 42:23.726
You know that, don't you?

42:26.295 --> 42:28.165
Anyway...

42:30.366 --> 42:33.200
Even if you were to turn me in,

42:35.071 --> 42:37.672
I wouldn't lift a finger.

42:40.076 --> 42:41.811
But...

42:42.211 --> 42:43.813
But?

42:44.113 --> 42:47.049
You have to think about the kids.

42:47.149 --> 42:49.552
And you have to think
about yourself, Darcy.

42:49.652 --> 42:52.188
Honey, you have to think about yourself!

42:52.288 --> 42:56.392
Who is going to believe that you lived with
me for all these years and you didn't know?

42:56.492 --> 42:58.294
- I didn't...
- Didn't even suspect.

42:58.394 --> 43:00.696
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, not once.

43:00.796 --> 43:03.544
You know, and then
you would have to move,

43:03.844 --> 43:07.490
and the Anderson coin and collectable
company would be blackballed,

43:07.590 --> 43:10.106
I can promise you that.

43:10.206 --> 43:13.843
And, you know, then there's the kids.

43:13.943 --> 43:16.178
They have to live with the shame
and the humiliation and...

43:16.278 --> 43:20.182
Stop it, don't say that! Don't talk
about them when you talk about this!

43:20.282 --> 43:24.884
- Don't ever, just don't do it!
- Okay, okay. Can we... can we, look...

43:24.985 --> 43:28.144
Can we just put it behind us, honey?

43:29.725 --> 43:33.310
Oh, God. I don't know.

43:34.363 --> 43:36.065
Okay.

43:36.165 --> 43:38.784
Just let me think about it, Bob.

43:39.235 --> 43:42.204
- Let me think about it.
- Sure, sure.

43:42.304 --> 43:45.580
It's okay, I understand.

43:48.844 --> 43:50.746
I'm really tired.

43:50.846 --> 43:55.117
It was a long drive. It was exhausting.

43:58.788 --> 44:01.924
Could you turn out the light, honey?

44:02.925 --> 44:05.026
Would you mind?

44:33.256 --> 44:35.725
Stupid bitch!

44:35.825 --> 44:38.127
Did you really think
I was going to let you live?

44:38.227 --> 44:41.864
Did you really think
I was going to let you live?

44:41.964 --> 44:45.921
Did you really think
that I was gonna let you live? Did you?

45:18.667 --> 45:20.500
Bob?

45:51.000 --> 45:52.833
Bob?

46:11.687 --> 46:13.515
Bob?

47:11.247 --> 47:15.091
I didn't kill those women. Not really.

47:15.484 --> 47:19.527
It was another person inside my head.

47:43.546 --> 47:45.408
Bob?

47:47.349 --> 47:49.282
I just thought, I'll do it, once.

47:49.382 --> 47:51.954
Get it out of my head.
If I get caught, I get caught.

47:52.054 --> 47:56.558
At least I won't have to think about it,
wonder what it'd be like.

50:06.488 --> 50:08.065
Darcy!

50:09.191 --> 50:11.360
Darcy, I'm home!

50:11.460 --> 50:13.293
Darc...

50:16.632 --> 50:18.367
Pizza?

50:18.467 --> 50:20.903
I didn't feel like cooking.

50:21.003 --> 50:24.506
- Yeah, but what about your acid reflux?
- I took a zantac.

50:25.507 --> 50:27.142
Okay.

50:27.242 --> 50:32.246
Well, since we're gonna be bad...
what do you say we have a little wine?

50:34.516 --> 50:36.985
I'll take that as a yes.

50:52.901 --> 50:54.248
I'll have another.

50:56.238 --> 50:59.472
Wow, you took a couple
of zantacs, didn't you?

51:17.826 --> 51:20.462
That's the one you left upstairs
on the little table.

51:20.562 --> 51:22.447
Did I?

51:23.732 --> 51:26.135
Must've forgot that I had it in my hand.

51:26.235 --> 51:29.605
I was going to cut myself an apple,
but I forgot the apple too.

51:29.705 --> 51:34.274
You know what it's like when you get tired.
You forget stuff. It's mushroom.

51:34.710 --> 51:37.045
- You have to promise me.
- What?

51:37.145 --> 51:38.881
You have to promise me
that you're going to stop.

51:38.981 --> 51:42.017
- Yes, honey, whatever you say.
- The most solemn...

51:43.218 --> 51:46.622
"Never go back on it" promise.

51:46.722 --> 51:49.558
I do. I told you that yesterday.

51:49.658 --> 51:52.827
And we could never talk
about this again.

51:56.932 --> 51:58.267
I get that.

51:58.767 --> 52:01.606
And you're not to send...

52:03.472 --> 52:06.589
the Duvall woman's ID to the police.

52:07.810 --> 52:11.450
I need more than promises, Bobby.
You dig a hole in the woods...

52:12.280 --> 52:16.342
somewhere, and you bury
that woman's ID in it.

52:16.618 --> 52:18.921
If I do that...

52:20.822 --> 52:21.997
Are we good?

52:24.393 --> 52:26.662
Of course we are.

52:27.162 --> 52:28.646
- You're good.
- I am good.

52:28.746 --> 52:31.136
- You're going to stay that way, aren't you?
- I am.

52:31.236 --> 52:33.204
Good, that's settled.
Go ahead and eat your pizza then.

52:36.872 --> 52:38.972
Oh, my God!

52:39.808 --> 52:40.861
That's hot!

52:41.777 --> 52:45.179
Don't take such big bites
and you won't burn your mouth.

52:47.215 --> 52:49.250
Mother knows best.

53:22.951 --> 53:27.890
And, Mom, I'm still waiting on 20 RSVPs.
And they're all his relatives!

53:27.990 --> 53:30.008
And he says that they're coming,
but how am I supposed to know that?

53:30.108 --> 53:33.678
- <i>Why wouldn't they RSVP?</i>
- Relax honey. Take a deep breath.

53:33.778 --> 53:35.797
The wedding is still weeks away, okay?

53:35.897 --> 53:38.634
Mom, I think it would've been easier
if we had just eloped.

53:38.734 --> 53:43.105
Now that would've broken my heart.
And your dad's, of course.

53:43.205 --> 53:46.341
- <i>How is the old fella?</i>
- Oh, you know Dad.

53:46.441 --> 53:48.136
He's upright and sniffing the air.

53:49.978 --> 53:52.595
Hey, have you talked to Donnie?
Are you sure that he's cleared his schedule,

53:52.695 --> 53:55.784
because... he's become
this damn success story and, just...

53:55.884 --> 53:58.287
Pets, your brother
will be there with bells on.

53:58.387 --> 54:01.924
- And if he's not, your dad will...
- Kill him? God, I hope so.

54:02.324 --> 54:04.793
Something like that.

54:04.893 --> 54:08.497
- Alright, I love you, Mom.
- <i>I love you too.</i>

54:08.597 --> 54:12.367
- And stop obsessing?
- Alright, I'll try.

54:12.467 --> 54:14.002
- <i>That's a plea.</i>
- Okay.

54:14.102 --> 54:16.603
- <i>Thanks, Mom.</i>
- Bye.

54:23.512 --> 54:25.747
<i>Our champion, Sable.</i>

54:26.147 --> 54:29.250
<i>Sable, and where are you from?</i>

54:29.651 --> 54:33.286
<i>Sable's from Harlem!
Isn't that wonderful?</i>

55:10.025 --> 55:14.363
- Any luck finding the great lost penny?
- No, not yet.

55:14.463 --> 55:18.998
But you know, all good things
come to those who wait.

55:30.713 --> 55:33.415
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

55:33.515 --> 55:38.387
It's... How long has it been
since we've had a... a girl-girl afternoon?

55:39.088 --> 55:42.691
I don't know, a couple of months?
I guess.

55:42.791 --> 55:45.027
That's right,
because you and Bob are so tight.

55:45.127 --> 55:47.395
- Yeah.
- I don't know how you do it, Darc.

55:47.495 --> 55:50.965
- Honestly.
- Yeah, neither do I.

55:53.969 --> 55:56.255
Oh, he's on the road, yeah?

55:56.355 --> 55:59.505
Yeah, yeah. He's just in Portsmouth.

55:59.632 --> 56:03.352
Some little stationary company
got their taxes all snarled up, you know,

56:03.452 --> 56:07.949
and there's a coin show tomorrow, but...
you know, he'll be back tomorrow.

56:08.049 --> 56:11.069
- Oh, with him, it's always a coin show.
- I know, I know.

56:11.169 --> 56:13.063
Does he actually have any other hobbies?

56:13.163 --> 56:15.681
- Let me clear these for you here.
- No, I'm not finished.

56:15.781 --> 56:17.292
- That's... that's alright.
- I'm not done!

56:17.392 --> 56:19.460
- Sorry.
- Right.

56:22.764 --> 56:24.532
Darc?

56:25.133 --> 56:27.136
I'm sorry.

56:29.037 --> 56:32.917
I'm sorry, you know, it's just the wedding.
Petra keeps calling every night,

56:33.017 --> 56:36.044
and every night there seems to be
a new problem and...

56:36.144 --> 56:38.647
Shit just rolls downhill, and...

56:38.747 --> 56:40.048
- That's it, that's it.
- Yeah.

56:40.148 --> 56:44.021
Exactly. And... you know, I just...

56:44.920 --> 56:48.589
I worry when Bob's on the road.
You know, when he's away.

56:51.059 --> 56:54.062
How about dessert? Enough.

57:31.833 --> 57:35.335
You're right, Bob. I can do it.

57:53.054 --> 57:55.740
<i>...friends have no knowledge
of the missing funds.</i>

57:55.840 --> 57:58.445
<i>In other news a Portsmouth woman
was found murdered</i>

57:58.545 --> 58:00.212
<i>in her apartment late this morning.</i>

58:00.312 --> 58:03.899
<i>Mikaela Blake, age 42,
had been shot three times.</i>

58:04.699 --> 58:07.501
<i>Police have taken Ms. Blake's common-law
husband into custody,</i>

58:07.601 --> 58:11.406
<i>and sources close to the investigation
say he's confessed.</i>

58:11.606 --> 58:14.743
<i>Of course, if the next one is Beadie's,</i>

58:14.843 --> 58:16.744
<i>she belongs to you, Darcy.</i>

59:01.223 --> 59:03.992
There's a fix-it muffler four blocks
down on Rayburn Avenue.

59:04.092 --> 59:06.828
Maybe you missed it? You only go past it
every day when you go to work.

59:06.928 --> 59:08.065
Yeah, well, you know.

59:09.431 --> 59:12.866
They fix the problem,
charge you three times what it's worth,

59:12.966 --> 59:15.837
and then point out six other things.

59:15.937 --> 59:20.275
And then... some big snooty guy
looks at you and says...

59:20.375 --> 59:23.776
"Hey, I'm just telling you,
it's your decision."

59:25.280 --> 59:27.933
Can you hand me the adjustable wrench?

59:34.990 --> 59:37.125
Darcy?

59:37.325 --> 59:39.740
You okay, Darc?

59:41.963 --> 59:44.520
I saw you looking at Betty.

59:44.866 --> 59:48.470
Yeah, well... that skirt
was pretty short.

59:48.570 --> 59:50.269
It's hard not to look.

59:51.106 --> 59:55.238
Well, then you're going to have
to try harder, aren't you?

59:59.681 --> 01:00:02.050
It's a big week next week?

01:00:02.951 --> 01:00:05.150
Petra's big week.

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:09.997
You want to hand me the adjustable?

01:00:10.925 --> 01:00:13.133
I want to get out of here.

01:00:17.832 --> 01:00:20.768
- Thank you, honey.
- You're welcome.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.624
- Honey, limo's here.
- I'll be down in a couple of minutes!

01:00:45.193 --> 01:00:48.361
- I brought you some fizzy water.
- Oh, thanks.

01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:53.468
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's wrong?

01:00:53.568 --> 01:00:57.026
You look gorgeous.

01:00:58.706 --> 01:01:02.808
No, no, no. None of that. I'm going
to have to fix my mouth all over again.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.584
But... Thank you. Thank you.
You're very sweet.

01:01:09.684 --> 01:01:12.985
So, go on. I'll be down
in just a couple minutes.

01:01:36.111 --> 01:01:37.770
Daddy...

01:01:41.249 --> 01:01:43.151
Congratulations.

01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:45.528
Quick, get a picture.

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:51.903
Brian, get over here. Come here!

01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:39.574
Folks, ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for the father and daughter dance.

01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:43.742
Let's get 'em out here.
Let's see them move, give them some room.

01:03:30.759 --> 01:03:34.326
Okay, guys, everybody dance!

01:03:36.364 --> 01:03:37.566
May I?

01:03:38.366 --> 01:03:40.268
You may.

01:03:40.368 --> 01:03:42.235
Enjoy.

01:03:56.184 --> 01:03:59.554
Darcy! You're missing your own party!

01:03:59.854 --> 01:04:04.659
- Hi, I'm just rehearsing my toast.
- You'll be fine.

01:04:04.759 --> 01:04:09.264
Honey, this is a beautiful wedding.
I'm so happy for you!

01:04:09.364 --> 01:04:12.598
Thank you, Betty. Thank you.

01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:22.177
Bob...

01:04:22.277 --> 01:04:24.913
I think he... he might have
a little thing for me.

01:04:25.013 --> 01:04:27.015
Betty...

01:04:27.315 --> 01:04:29.541
Yes, on a few occasions I have suggested

01:04:29.641 --> 01:04:32.015
that he put his eyes
back into his head. Okay.

01:04:33.388 --> 01:04:36.624
I just want you to know that I have never
encouraged it and I never would.

01:04:36.724 --> 01:04:39.661
Because you're my best friend.

01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:41.696
I know that, honey.

01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:45.176
- You are such a peach.
- I know.

01:04:47.135 --> 01:04:50.285
You deserve every good thing
that's happened to you.

01:04:52.106 --> 01:04:54.874
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

01:05:24.372 --> 01:05:27.553
- Bob, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:05:28.409 --> 01:05:31.473
Nothing, everything is finally right.

01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:34.377
Oh, honey...

01:05:38.052 --> 01:05:40.519
If I was a poet,

01:05:40.619 --> 01:05:43.692
I could tell you how grateful I am
for this second chance.

01:05:44.092 --> 01:05:47.532
To be here, to see all of this, but...

01:05:48.663 --> 01:05:52.467
I'm just a lousy,
coin collecting accountant.

01:05:53.868 --> 01:05:55.882
So all I can say is thank you.

01:05:57.739 --> 01:06:00.207
Thank you so much.

01:06:04.979 --> 01:06:06.781
Come on.

01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:09.615
- We need to get back in there.
- Yeah.

01:08:18.912 --> 01:08:22.243
Mrs. Moore? Mrs. Moore?

01:08:22.582 --> 01:08:26.251
- Are you alright?
- Darcy!

01:08:28.589 --> 01:08:30.859
- Petra?
- Darcy!

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:34.287
Darcy! Darcy!

01:08:34.895 --> 01:08:35.988
Darcy.

01:08:37.497 --> 01:08:40.180
Darcy! Darcy!

01:08:40.397 --> 01:08:41.884
- Darcy!
- What?

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.064
Darcy, you're never going to believe it?
You're never going to believe it.

01:08:44.163 --> 01:08:46.166
- You're scaring the Jesus out of me, what?
- Pick a hand.

01:08:46.366 --> 01:08:48.274
What? I don't want
to play games, Bob, what...

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.999
Come on, come on, come on,
pick, pick, pick, pick!

01:08:54.048 --> 01:08:56.238
You read my mind. But you always could.

01:08:59.283 --> 01:09:03.577
- Found it in the change bear.
- You just found this?

01:09:03.676 --> 01:09:06.194
- Let me see this.
- I was just going through the change.

01:09:06.294 --> 01:09:09.196
Oh, my gosh. How many years
have you been searching for this?

01:09:09.296 --> 01:09:11.604
Since I was 14 years old.

01:09:11.705 --> 01:09:15.666
- Isn't it great?
- I know. I'm so happy for you.

01:09:15.765 --> 01:09:19.640
So, what do you think? Is it fine
or very fine? You're the expert?

01:09:19.741 --> 01:09:23.109
- Well, I'd love to say VF, but...
- I know, I know, I know.

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:26.214
- But it's better than VG.
- Oh, definitely better than VG. Definitely.

01:09:26.314 --> 01:09:28.173
You know what, if your dad was here,

01:09:28.273 --> 01:09:31.169
he would be cracking open
a bottle of champagne. I just know it.

01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:35.523
Well, I will take care of that
tonight at pearl of the shore.

01:09:35.622 --> 01:09:37.091
Oh, Bob. I... I don't know.

01:09:37.191 --> 01:09:40.027
Come on, come on.
Put on your prettiest dress...

01:09:40.227 --> 01:09:43.196
I will buy as much champagne
as you can drink.

01:09:44.064 --> 01:09:47.868
Well, okay. How about
as much champagne as you can drink,

01:09:47.969 --> 01:09:50.872
and I'll drive home?
It's your find, after all.

01:09:51.072 --> 01:09:52.831
Deal.

01:11:05.746 --> 01:11:08.113
Alright, one more time!

01:11:10.743 --> 01:11:13.154
Yes!

01:11:13.254 --> 01:11:16.419
- Am I going to get to be a naughty boy?
- Oh, you might.

01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:18.534
You might.

01:11:24.899 --> 01:11:28.685
Come here, come here.

01:11:32.173 --> 01:11:36.977
Oh, I'm going to go upstairs
and I'm going to get out of this dress.

01:11:37.278 --> 01:11:38.878
And...

01:11:38.978 --> 01:11:43.398
if you bring me some fizzy water
and a wedge of lime,

01:11:43.498 --> 01:11:47.338
you just might get lucky mister. But...

01:11:47.822 --> 01:11:50.157
- it will cost you.
- How much?

01:11:50.257 --> 01:11:53.127
For you? Just a penny.

01:11:53.227 --> 01:11:54.960
Wait...

01:12:03.671 --> 01:12:05.637
For safekeeping.

01:12:07.775 --> 01:12:12.262
- I want you on top, alright?
- Yes. With the mirror.

01:12:12.563 --> 01:12:16.215
Hey, now, hurry up, hurry up,
you naughty boy.

01:13:04.565 --> 01:13:07.598
Here I come, ready or not!

01:13:08.202 --> 01:13:12.170
- Are you my bad, bad girl?
- Are you my naughty boy?

01:15:04.313 --> 01:15:08.787
- Why did you push me?
- Maybe it was female exploration.

01:15:11.058 --> 01:15:16.029
I so hoped that the fall would kill you.
I knew it might not.

01:15:24.972 --> 01:15:28.976
Yeah, here I am, Bobby! Oh, I'm on top.

01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:34.186
Just the way you like it, right? Right?

01:18:59.486 --> 01:19:02.438
Okay. That's fine. That's fine.

01:19:02.538 --> 01:19:05.256
That's fine. I'm fine.

01:19:16.837 --> 01:19:18.172
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:19:18.272 --> 01:19:21.725
This is Darcelene Anderson calling
from 24 Sugar Mill Lane.

01:19:21.825 --> 01:19:25.779
My husband just fell down the stairs
and I think I might... he might be dead.

01:19:25.879 --> 01:19:28.281
<i>I'm going to need you to go over
and check to see if he's breathing.</i>

01:19:28.381 --> 01:19:29.838
<i>I already have help on the way.</i>

01:19:34.488 --> 01:19:37.524
For I am the resurrection and the life.

01:19:37.624 --> 01:19:42.229
And he who believeth on me,
even if he die,

01:19:42.329 --> 01:19:44.024
yet shall he live.

01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:48.239
So we commit thy servant,

01:19:48.339 --> 01:19:51.672
Robert Anderson, to the ground.

01:19:51.772 --> 01:19:56.243
In the sure belief that the good works
of his honest life

01:19:56.743 --> 01:19:59.259
will recommend him to thee

01:19:59.359 --> 01:20:01.844
on the day of judgment.

01:20:02.983 --> 01:20:06.017
Hang in, Mom. Almost finished.

01:20:06.754 --> 01:20:09.295
Would the family like to approach?

01:20:17.764 --> 01:20:20.043
Rest in peace, pop.

01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:33.324
Miss you, Dad.

01:20:59.439 --> 01:21:01.008
They were very special to me.

01:21:01.108 --> 01:21:02.643
Then why didn't you put them
in the coffin?

01:21:02.743 --> 01:21:06.577
I forgot, Pets. But, hush.

01:21:07.447 --> 01:21:10.533
May the lord bless you and keep you.

01:21:11.184 --> 01:21:15.266
May the lord raise up his face upon you.

01:21:25.065 --> 01:21:27.968
Nice dress. If it was any shorter
you could see her a...

01:21:28.068 --> 01:21:30.937
Don't you ever.

01:21:31.938 --> 01:21:33.599
Ever!

01:21:39.146 --> 01:21:43.183
- She's just upset.
- Boy, is she ever.

01:21:44.484 --> 01:21:48.188
Do you think there's any booze
in that limo? I could use a drink.

01:21:48.488 --> 01:21:50.380
Yeah, I'm buying.

01:22:06.639 --> 01:22:09.798
Thank you so much, Mrs. Anderson.
God bless you.

01:22:09.898 --> 01:22:11.978
You too father. You're very welcome.

01:22:12.078 --> 01:22:15.649
Some good comes of our greatest losses.

01:22:15.749 --> 01:22:17.682
If you say so.

01:22:37.738 --> 01:22:39.541
Hello.

01:22:40.173 --> 01:22:42.075
Mrs. Anderson.

01:22:42.175 --> 01:22:44.612
Yes. Can I help you?

01:22:46.913 --> 01:22:47.982
Yeah, I...

01:22:50.801 --> 01:22:52.619
Well, thank you.

01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:55.204
Holt Ramsey. I'm with...

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.391
office of the state's Attorney General.

01:22:57.791 --> 01:22:59.526
Does RET mean you're retired?

01:22:59.626 --> 01:23:04.365
Well, I'm an old dog. They toss me
a bone now and then, I chew on it.

01:23:06.575 --> 01:23:10.088
I think I've seen you.
Have you been here before?

01:23:10.438 --> 01:23:12.491
According to the Hindus, we all have.

01:23:13.972 --> 01:23:17.351
Yes. What can I do for you, Mr. Ramsey?

01:23:17.544 --> 01:23:19.370
Inside would be better.

01:23:34.594 --> 01:23:37.112
My, this is...

01:23:37.631 --> 01:23:41.733
a lovely home
you have here missus. Look...

01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:46.773
a place for everything,
and everything in its place.

01:23:46.873 --> 01:23:49.776
My wife would have approved.

01:23:50.227 --> 01:23:52.579
How I miss her.

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:56.216
Just the way I imagine
I miss your husband.

01:23:56.316 --> 01:23:58.149
Yes.

01:23:59.803 --> 01:24:03.957
What may I do for you, Mr. Ramsey?
I'm sorry, or is it Detective Ramsey?

01:24:04.057 --> 01:24:06.393
Donkey ears since anyone
called me "detective."

01:24:06.493 --> 01:24:10.964
No, you go straight to Holt.
That'll do me just fine.

01:24:11.064 --> 01:24:13.358
But, the thing is, I get bored,

01:24:13.458 --> 01:24:17.244
just the TV for company, so...
I thought to myself...

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:20.987
"I'll... what the hell,
I'll take that drive down to Cleaves Mills

01:24:21.087 --> 01:24:24.330
and I'll just ask a few
of my little questions."

01:24:25.195 --> 01:24:26.834
Here.

01:24:28.248 --> 01:24:30.081
Have a look.

01:24:35.522 --> 01:24:36.784
Turn it over.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:52.205
- Oh, I see you do know my name.
- Indeed I do. Both your names.

01:24:52.743 --> 01:24:55.669
Bob, Darcy. BD. Beadie.

01:24:55.769 --> 01:24:57.040
Look at you.

01:24:57.850 --> 01:25:01.415
Look at you both. Rubbing our noses
in it the whole time, weren't you?

01:25:01.515 --> 01:25:03.603
I'm sorry.

01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:06.386
There are twelve women
who are dead missus...

01:25:06.486 --> 01:25:08.859
I'm surprised you can laugh at that.

01:25:12.799 --> 01:25:15.442
Sit down. Sit down right there,

01:25:15.542 --> 01:25:20.264
and just be quiet. Troublesome man.

01:25:35.148 --> 01:25:38.318
- Never touch that stuff.
- You know you're crazy.

01:25:38.719 --> 01:25:40.754
Could be.

01:25:41.354 --> 01:25:44.691
But I noticed you haven't
asked me to leave yet.

01:25:45.091 --> 01:25:46.993
I mean...

01:25:48.794 --> 01:25:51.965
I probably don't have much
of a case, you know that.

01:25:52.065 --> 01:25:54.134
You have no case.

01:25:54.234 --> 01:25:56.770
Doesn't matter, missus.

01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:59.973
There are ways, and there are ways.

01:26:00.073 --> 01:26:03.176
Once I come upon this fella,
way far upstate.

01:26:03.276 --> 01:26:06.246
Killed his wife, two kiddies.

01:26:06.346 --> 01:26:09.450
Tried to make it look
like home invasion.

01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:14.588
I chewed on that old bone.
Got a taste for it.

01:26:14.688 --> 01:26:19.559
Chewed that bone
'til the fella got nervous and he ran.

01:26:20.659 --> 01:26:23.685
- And what happened to him.
- I chased him.

01:26:23.985 --> 01:26:27.901
Right up into the Haynesville Woods.
You know?

01:26:28.001 --> 01:26:31.539
Where the song says
there's a tombstone every mile.

01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:37.344
Well, he crashed. And I crashed right
after him, and that's how I got this leg,

01:26:37.444 --> 01:26:40.213
not to mention this steel rod
that I got in my neck.

01:26:40.313 --> 01:26:43.150
I can tell you when it's going to rain.

01:26:44.351 --> 01:26:48.749
And the kid that you were chasing?
What did he get?

01:26:48.849 --> 01:26:50.410
He got death.

01:26:54.294 --> 01:26:57.128
Burned to death in his car.

01:26:58.164 --> 01:27:03.103
Saved the state... 40-50 years
room and board in Shawshank.

01:27:04.304 --> 01:27:07.708
You are quite the hound of heaven,
aren't you, Mr. Ramsey?

01:27:09.175 --> 01:27:13.046
"I fled him down the night
and down the day."

01:27:13.246 --> 01:27:15.996
"I fled him down the arches and veers."

01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:21.517
"I fled him down the labyrinthine ways."

01:27:23.556 --> 01:27:27.027
- And so on.
- Did you learn that in school?

01:27:27.127 --> 01:27:30.014
Methodist youth fellowship.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:33.591
I won't let you ruin
my children's lives.

01:27:34.401 --> 01:27:36.277
Well,

01:27:36.677 --> 01:27:39.573
if you think about it, missus,

01:27:39.673 --> 01:27:41.867
it wasn't me put ruin in their way.

01:27:48.715 --> 01:27:50.704
You think about it.

01:29:42.495 --> 01:29:45.251
Go ahead if you want to, but...

01:29:45.762 --> 01:29:48.677
I don't think you'll get away
with it twice.

01:29:53.873 --> 01:29:58.223
What's the worst thing
that you ever did?

01:29:59.913 --> 01:30:02.857
Come on. It's just the two of us.

01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:05.963
And you know what they say:

01:30:06.063 --> 01:30:09.389
Two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead.

01:30:09.489 --> 01:30:13.603
And you'll be dead soon enough,
won't you?

01:30:23.203 --> 01:30:28.978
You recall that fella I told you about?
The one who killed his wife and kids?

01:30:30.077 --> 01:30:34.769
Well, after he wrapped his mustang
around a tree, I...

01:30:34.869 --> 01:30:38.661
I just sat and I listened
to the screams.

01:30:40.487 --> 01:30:42.818
For quite a while.

01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:46.909
Finally they stopped.

01:30:49.062 --> 01:30:51.665
And then I called it in.

01:30:51.965 --> 01:30:53.834
And who else knows?

01:30:54.834 --> 01:30:56.942
Only you.

01:30:57.437 --> 01:30:59.372
Because...

01:30:59.472 --> 01:31:04.063
people wouldn't understand, would they?

01:31:05.011 --> 01:31:07.305
Tell me something...

01:31:08.014 --> 01:31:11.065
Just what was it that you...

01:31:11.718 --> 01:31:13.068
threw into the grave.

01:31:14.354 --> 01:31:17.821
They were the earrings
that my husband...

01:31:23.296 --> 01:31:27.051
gave me for my 25th anniversary.

01:31:27.734 --> 01:31:32.523
They were fish earrings
because I was a Pisces, he said.

01:31:32.623 --> 01:31:35.475
And they belonged to Marjorie Duvall.

01:31:37.877 --> 01:31:39.624
He raped her.

01:31:40.665 --> 01:31:42.845
And he murdered her.

01:31:42.945 --> 01:31:47.223
And stole her earrings,
and gave them to me.

01:31:49.289 --> 01:31:53.595
And I thought,
"Oh, he's just so thoughtful."

01:32:05.705 --> 01:32:08.381
Marjorie Duvall's ID...

01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:11.771
was in this box.

01:32:13.079 --> 01:32:18.615
The box that his daughter made him
for a school project.

01:32:23.089 --> 01:32:26.319
He promised to stop.

01:32:26.826 --> 01:32:29.948
- Did you believe him?
- No.

01:32:31.364 --> 01:32:37.137
But I needed time to... to think, and...

01:32:37.937 --> 01:32:40.990
I wanted to spare my children.

01:32:42.142 --> 01:32:44.908
You didn't come here to kill me.

01:32:45.345 --> 01:32:49.177
You never would've brought this
if you had.

01:32:50.817 --> 01:32:54.732
There's one thing
that I can't quite get by.

01:32:56.389 --> 01:32:58.109
The initials.

01:32:58.209 --> 01:33:00.364
B-D.

01:33:00.464 --> 01:33:02.560
Beadie.

01:33:03.696 --> 01:33:06.610
Beadie was something else.

01:33:09.035 --> 01:33:12.167
When my husband was a boy,

01:33:12.267 --> 01:33:15.909
he had a friend
who was killed in an accident.

01:33:16.009 --> 01:33:20.579
It was a boy with... fantasies.

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.083
His name was Brian Delahanty.

01:33:24.183 --> 01:33:27.720
I guess he didn't like his first name
very much, because...

01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.929
when my husband was a kid,

01:33:30.029 --> 01:33:32.933
- he used to call him...
- BD.

01:33:39.732 --> 01:33:42.167
Would you have caught him?

01:33:42.368 --> 01:33:44.264
Oh, yeah.

01:34:06.459 --> 01:34:08.410
It's blurred,

01:34:09.078 --> 01:34:11.924
like it's two pennies.

01:34:12.432 --> 01:34:14.367
Yeah.

01:34:14.667 --> 01:34:17.621
Some people are that way too.

01:34:22.609 --> 01:34:26.464
I'll go now. And...

01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:30.224
You'll do what you have to do.

01:34:32.352 --> 01:34:34.218
Missus.

01:34:40.293 --> 01:34:43.717
The only thing I have to do...

01:34:45.298 --> 01:34:47.296
is pay my taxes.

01:34:49.836 --> 01:34:52.316
It's not for me to punish you.

01:34:52.872 --> 01:34:55.552
You know your kids are gonna...

01:34:55.652 --> 01:35:00.032
talk about how much
they miss dear old... Dad.

01:35:00.832 --> 01:35:06.086
And tell their grandkids
about what a fine fella grandpa was.

01:35:07.587 --> 01:35:12.673
You're just going to sit there
and listen. Nod, smile...

01:35:12.915 --> 01:35:14.869
once in a while,

01:35:14.969 --> 01:35:17.959
even have to talk
about the good old days.

01:35:23.703 --> 01:35:26.241
I can live with that.

01:35:27.907 --> 01:35:28.901
Darcy.

01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:33.400
Come over here, close to me.

01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:49.767
You did the right thing.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.508
Now would you mind putting
my music on for me?

01:36:20.994 --> 01:36:26.032
<i>All you big and burly men
who roll the trucks along</i>

01:36:26.132 --> 01:36:30.937
<i>You'd better listen, you'll be thankful
when you hear my song</i>

01:36:31.337 --> 01:36:36.876
<i>You have really got it made
if you're hauling goods</i>

01:36:36.976 --> 01:36:42.648
<i>Any place on earth
but those Haynesville Woods</i>

01:36:42.748 --> 01:36:48.120
<i>It's a stretch of road up north in Maine</i>

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:52.692
<i>That's never, ever, ever seen a smile</i>

01:36:52.792 --> 01:36:57.697
<i>And if they buried all the truckers
lost in them woods</i>

01:36:57.797 --> 01:37:02.468
<i>There'd be a tombstone every mile</i>

01:37:15.748 --> 01:37:20.620
<i>And if they buried all the truckers
lost them woods</i>

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.925
<i>There'd be a tombstone every mile</i>

01:37:26.025 --> 01:37:28.269
<i>Count 'em all</i>

01:37:28.369 --> 01:37:31.729
<i>There'd be a tombstone</i>

01:37:31.829 --> 01:37:36.651
<i>Every mile</i>

01:37:38.954 --> 01:37:43.909
<i>When you're talking to a trucker
that's been hauling goods</i>

01:37:44.009 --> 01:37:49.265
<i>Down the stretch of road in Maine
they call the Haynesville Woods</i>

01:37:49.365 --> 01:37:54.120
<i>He'll tell you that dying
and going down below</i>

01:37:54.220 --> 01:38:00.443
<i>Won't be half as bad as driving
on the road of ice and snow</i>

01:38:00.543 --> 01:38:05.931
<i>It's a stretch of road up north in Maine</i>

01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:10.570
<i>That's never, ever, ever seen a smile</i>

01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:15.508
<i>And if they buried all the truckers
lost in them woods</i>

01:38:15.608 --> 01:38:19.521
<i>There'd be a tombstone every mile</i>

01:38:19.621 --> 01:38:22.219
<i>Count 'em all</i>

01:38:24.533 --> 01:38:27.853
<i>There'd be a tombstone</i>

01:38:27.953 --> 01:38:32.282
<i>Every mile</i>

01:38:55.548 --> 01:39:01.587
<i>I can see you smile</i>

01:39:01.687 --> 01:39:04.790
<i>And I can hear you</i>

01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:08.528
<i>Say hello</i>

01:39:08.628 --> 01:39:14.433
<i>You're everywhere I go</i>

01:39:14.533 --> 01:39:18.029
<i>Such is my love</i>

01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:27.313
<i>Even though I try</i>

01:39:27.413 --> 01:39:30.826
<i>I can't forget</i>

01:39:30.926 --> 01:39:35.059
<i>the way you sigh</i>

01:39:35.159 --> 01:39:40.926
<i>My heart can't help but cry</i>

01:39:41.026 --> 01:39:45.898
<i>Such is my love</i>

01:39:45.998 --> 01:39:51.037
<i>I just go on</i>

01:39:51.137 --> 01:39:55.708
<i>Longing for your kisses</i>

01:39:55.808 --> 01:40:00.887
<i>Still thrilling to your charms</i>

01:40:02.982 --> 01:40:09.662
<i>I never spend a day without dreaming</i>

01:40:09.762 --> 01:40:14.818
<i>You're right here in my arms</i>

01:40:17.596 --> 01:40:21.617
<i>If you only knew</i>

01:40:21.717 --> 01:40:24.555
<i>The restless nights</i>

01:40:24.655 --> 01:40:28.704
<i>my heart goes through</i>

01:40:28.804 --> 01:40:34.613
<i>I'm helpless, what to do</i>

01:40:34.713 --> 01:40:38.283
<i>How can I hide</i>

01:40:41.053 --> 01:40:47.727
<i>The tears I keep inside</i>

01:40:48.127 --> 01:40:51.695
<i>Such is my love</i>

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:18.501
<i>Such is my love</i>

01:41:21.327 --> 01:41:23.234
<i>The tears</i>

01:41:23.334 --> 01:41:28.900
<i>I keep inside</i>

01:41:29.468 --> 01:41:35.536
<i>Such is my love</i>
