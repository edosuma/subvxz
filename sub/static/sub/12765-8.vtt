00:00.839 --> 00:02.836
<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.892 --> 00:04.860
- I'm Kyle.
- My name's Sarah.

00:04.861 --> 00:08.151
Jessi was so excited to find out
that her mother is really alive.

00:08.151 --> 00:10.173
All she wants is to know you.

00:10.174 --> 00:12.254
We have to get away
from all this, Jessi.

00:12.255 --> 00:14.135
We have to start
our new life.

00:14.136 --> 00:15.240
I'll be back.

00:16.126 --> 00:19.498
Sarah just left. I would
never do that to you.

00:19.499 --> 00:21.693
- I know that.
- Just go out there,

00:21.694 --> 00:24.707
find a girl, grab her
and just rebound.

00:25.904 --> 00:28.298
- Oh, my God!
- I can't believe you refuse

00:28.299 --> 00:30.737
to speak to me over something
that doesn't even matter to you anymore.

00:30.738 --> 00:32.973
What, the fact
that Declan kissed you

00:32.974 --> 00:35.108
- or that you let him?
- I didn't let him.

00:35.109 --> 00:36.751
- God!
- I'm Jackie.

00:36.752 --> 00:40.188
- Declan.
- Are you a good guy or am I wasting my time?

00:40.189 --> 00:44.076
- I'm about 80 percent good guy.
- Those are pretty good odds.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.334
My mom got a job
she couldn't pass up.

00:46.454 --> 00:48.106
We move at the end
of the month.

00:48.107 --> 00:50.616
You can't move.
What about us?

00:52.789 --> 00:54.357
I never caught your name.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.276
- Jessi.
- I'm Cassidy.

00:57.277 --> 00:59.112
Everyone else at Latnok
seems genuine.

00:59.113 --> 01:00.942
I'm still not convinced
about Cassidy.

01:00.943 --> 01:04.123
- What do you know about Sarah?
- She's an old friend of Latnok.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.818
He's hiding something
in his office.

01:09.166 --> 01:13.102
He has Sarah's ring, but it might have
something to do with her disappearance.

01:13.112 --> 01:15.102
My mother
didn't leave me.

01:15.112 --> 01:18.783
- I don't think she did.
- I need to find out what happened to her.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.620
Promise me you'll
help me find out.

01:21.740 --> 01:22.979
I promise.

02:37.730 --> 02:38.979
Jessi?

02:41.507 --> 02:42.408
Hey.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.841
- Are you OK?
- I've just been doing some research.

02:46.859 --> 02:48.935
I tapped into the rental
car company's records,

02:48.944 --> 02:53.002
and it turns out Sarah returned her car
the day after she supposedly left town.

02:53.003 --> 02:56.714
- It was definitely Sarah?
- I called the rental company.

02:56.715 --> 03:01.191
The car was dropped off...
I mean, nobody saw her, exactly.

03:01.207 --> 03:03.793
- But it still could've been Sarah.
- That's true.

03:06.481 --> 03:07.747
What's the matter?

03:07.867 --> 03:10.946
Uh, nothing. Just a headache.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.810
We'll find her, right?

03:16.931 --> 03:19.526
<i>She was so hopeful.
How could I tell her</i>

03:19.527 --> 03:21.854
<i>what I feared might have
happened to her mother?</i>

03:22.521 --> 03:23.761
We'll find her.

03:34.008 --> 03:36.992
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 8:
Tell-Tale Heart</font>

03:43.074 --> 03:45.564
- Yes?
- Don't mind me.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.245
Just keep at it, big guy.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.891
What are you doing?

03:51.218 --> 03:53.187
You're a paragon,
Stephen Trager.

03:53.743 --> 03:56.200
The kind of man a son
can hope to be someday.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.163
Paragon? Huh.

03:58.164 --> 04:00.890
At least you're attempting to
butter me up with an SAT word.

04:02.056 --> 04:04.627
Come on. You know
you can ask me anything.

04:04.628 --> 04:07.360
You're right. I mean,
you love me unconditionally,

04:07.370 --> 04:09.893
and you always have my
best interests at heart.

04:11.733 --> 04:14.635
And that's why you're gonna
let Andy move in with us.

04:18.945 --> 04:21.521
- Josh...
- Don't say no.

04:21.522 --> 04:24.053
No is not on the list
of acceptable responses.

04:24.054 --> 04:26.848
- Unfortunately, it is.
- Come on!

04:27.108 --> 04:30.989
Mom brings home strays whenever she wants and the one time I ask, you suddenly get picky?

04:30.990 --> 04:33.598
Kyle and Jessi are a different
story and you know it.

04:33.617 --> 04:36.629
But if Andy can't stay here,
then she has to move.

04:37.273 --> 04:40.846
To Cleveland.
For, like, ever.

04:41.521 --> 04:43.803
I know that's gonna be really
hard for you to deal with.

04:43.822 --> 04:45.813
So don't make me
have to deal with it.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.766
Please, Dad.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.472
I'm sorry. I really am.
It's just not an option.

04:54.885 --> 04:58.453
Not even a tiny sorta "let me
discuss it with your mother" option?

04:59.125 --> 05:00.149
Not even that.

05:02.149 --> 05:03.088
Great.

05:05.268 --> 05:06.693
Way to be there for me.

05:21.149 --> 05:23.494
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

05:23.503 --> 05:25.508
You're looking
for Cassidy. Don't.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.902
I'm just wondering
where he is.

05:29.050 --> 05:32.462
We can't let him know we suspect he's
involved in Sarah's disappearance.

05:32.463 --> 05:34.595
It'll just make it harder
to find what he's hiding.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.768
- I know.
- So act normal.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.918
I could make him
tell us what he's hiding.

05:39.919 --> 05:42.518
- That's not acting normal.
- It is for me.

05:48.822 --> 05:50.535
Good work, I like it a lot.

05:52.293 --> 05:54.610
- My head.
- Are you OK?

05:54.925 --> 05:57.855
- Yeah.
- You can do this.

05:58.647 --> 06:01.617
Hi. How are my two favorite
brainiacs this morning?

06:01.737 --> 06:04.302
- Good, thanks.
- Fine.

06:05.996 --> 06:09.054
- Is everything all right?
- She's just been tired.

06:09.055 --> 06:12.914
- Maybe you're coming down with something.
- No, I'm fine. See?

06:12.915 --> 06:14.880
I'll have them fix a cup of tea.
You'll feel better.

06:14.915 --> 06:17.539
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, it's all right. I'm here to help.

06:20.244 --> 06:23.490
You know the plan. Copy his
cell's memory card, then get out.

06:23.718 --> 06:26.723
Yeah. Just make sure
you buy me enough time.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.783
I'll try.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.580
You have time
for a demonstration?

06:35.581 --> 06:37.204
Yeah, absolutely.
What you got?

06:58.135 --> 07:00.693
The door was open. I swear,
I knocked and rang the bell,

07:00.712 --> 07:03.147
- but obviously...
- Kyle's not here.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.421
- No, actually I stopped by to...
- He and Jessi were whispery at breakfast table,

07:06.422 --> 07:10.031
which is if you ask me, a little too buddy-buddy for my taste because, get this,

07:10.040 --> 07:12.245
apparently Jessi is crushing on Kyle something fierce.

07:12.246 --> 07:14.783
I don't know where they went or when Kyle's coming back. For all I know,

07:14.792 --> 07:16.774
she lured him out of the house to a cabin to lock him up

07:16.783 --> 07:18.455
and turn him into her love-slave.

07:18.465 --> 07:22.029
- Trager, I'm here to see you.
- Oh. You are?

07:22.030 --> 07:24.173
I came to see if you
wanted to hit The Rack.

07:24.207 --> 07:27.187
And it looks like you could
stand some quality friend time.

07:27.226 --> 07:29.405
Why, because I'm dancing
around the house

07:29.413 --> 07:32.111
and babbling like you're the first
person I've talked to all day?

07:33.521 --> 07:34.836
I'll get my purse.

07:45.015 --> 07:47.602
As you can see, I've modified
the design to accommodate

07:47.609 --> 07:50.944
several different energy sources.
It can use electricity, fission

07:50.953 --> 07:53.577
or solar power to process a
petabyte of data from the sensor.

07:53.587 --> 07:56.300
- That's really interesting man.
- Thanks.

07:56.308 --> 07:59.523
I've also reduced the transfer
time to less than a picosecond

07:59.524 --> 08:02.623
so the data now degrades only a
tenth as much as when I started.

08:02.624 --> 08:05.278
Fantastic. Good job.

08:05.279 --> 08:07.468
Now, onto the program specs.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.716
That's fantastic.
Really good work, man.

08:40.717 --> 08:43.601
<i>There's this really funny video
about a Star Wars kid.</i>

08:43.611 --> 08:45.515
- You should see it.
- Saw that one.

08:45.528 --> 08:47.891
Made the rounds a few
years ago. But good work.

08:47.900 --> 08:48.682
Keep it up.

09:00.836 --> 09:03.406
- Oh, my God. Are you all right sweetheart?
- Uh-huh.  - Ok, good.

09:03.411 --> 09:05.667
Hey guys, step back.
Let's get someone to fix that.

09:07.424 --> 09:08.447
What are you doing?

09:10.537 --> 09:11.751
What are you looking at?

09:11.769 --> 09:14.211
Jessi, are you OK?

09:14.626 --> 09:17.492
I don't know,
I feel strange.

09:19.541 --> 09:20.799
I'm gonna take you home.

09:30.302 --> 09:32.578
- What took you so long?
- I wanted Sarah's ring.

09:32.590 --> 09:34.605
- Jessi...
- I didn't take it. I didn't have time.

09:34.613 --> 09:36.083
Good. He would've missed it.

09:36.337 --> 09:38.611
I hate that he has it.
It's hers.

09:38.624 --> 09:40.013
We'll get it
back eventually.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.813
Mean while that was a
good cover with Nate.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.401
I really thought
you were sick.

09:44.308 --> 09:45.495
Jessi!

09:54.878 --> 09:57.530
- Are you OK?
- What happened?

09:57.817 --> 10:00.421
- You fainted.
- I fainted?

10:00.422 --> 10:04.276
I thought you were pretending,
and then you just... Are you OK?

10:04.768 --> 10:06.881
Yeah. I guess
I got a little dizzy.

10:07.695 --> 10:10.383
This is a lot to deal with.
If you need to take some time...

10:10.384 --> 10:12.644
- I know.
- Jessi...

10:13.096 --> 10:14.955
Thank you
for looking out for me,

10:15.075 --> 10:17.664
- but you promised you'd help.
- And I will, but...

10:17.674 --> 10:19.436
Kyle, I'm fine.

10:22.724 --> 10:25.245
Let's go home and check out
Cassidy's call log.

10:26.954 --> 10:31.087
And here, working like
a drone we find the boyfriend.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.428
The boyfriend
is not in the mood.

10:33.349 --> 10:35.949
This isn't still photography.
Look alive.

10:35.955 --> 10:38.035
Look around.
It's dead in here.

10:38.036 --> 10:39.916
When it gets like this,
I need you to entertain me,

10:39.917 --> 10:42.313
which you will not do once
you're 2,000 miles away.

10:42.335 --> 10:44.811
And imagine me there,
missing you.

10:45.116 --> 10:47.219
Thus, the whole point
of my Andy-mentary.

10:47.260 --> 10:50.840
When I need my Josh-fix, I'll just
pop it in. But let me tell you, this?

10:50.841 --> 10:53.618
Not buyin' the DVD.
Even on clearance.

10:54.066 --> 10:55.918
So pep up or perish.

11:04.874 --> 11:07.403
OK, so this song, you have
to listen to the words

11:07.409 --> 11:09.602
because they're romantic,
without being sappy.

11:09.603 --> 11:12.646
Do you do a play-by-play every
time a guy gives you a mix?

11:12.647 --> 11:14.650
I cant help it.
Mark has good taste in music.

11:14.659 --> 11:17.879
- Terrific.
- Oh. Sorry.

11:17.889 --> 11:21.828
This is weird, huh? Last time
you were the one making mixes,

11:21.837 --> 11:24.579
and I was forcing Hilary
to listen. But now...

11:25.439 --> 11:27.981
So you guys
still aren't talking?

11:27.982 --> 11:31.320
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Don't you think if you two could get in the same room...?

11:31.321 --> 11:33.889
There is no way I'm getting
in the same room with Hilary.

11:33.890 --> 11:38.217
Who says Hilary wants to be in
the same room as you. Ready?

11:38.971 --> 11:42.066
- For what?
- Ignoring you and hanging out with me.

11:46.468 --> 11:49.759
You're the one who was all, "Meet me
at The Rack, we need some quality... "

11:49.768 --> 11:51.299
Friend time?

11:52.777 --> 11:57.645
OK, I know I lied to get you both down
here, but this fight has gone on too long.

11:57.657 --> 12:01.410
So I'm just gonna get us some
coffee and you two can work it out.

12:04.363 --> 12:06.264
Not funny, Declan.
Open up.

12:06.265 --> 12:08.104
This is not what
I signed on for.

12:08.109 --> 12:09.825
Quality friend time, ladies.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.328
Make it happen,
and I set you free.

12:27.279 --> 12:32.416
- You find anything?
- No. Just that Cassidy likes to order takeout a lot.

12:32.417 --> 12:35.705
- He likes pizza.
- His phone logs aren't giving us anything.

12:35.706 --> 12:38.355
It would help if we had
a record of Sarah's calls.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.423
So Sarah was always on the run.
She wasn't the kind

12:40.429 --> 12:43.486
- of person to use a regular cell phone.
- Isn't.

12:44.379 --> 12:46.929
- What?
- She isn't the kind of person.

12:49.389 --> 12:52.856
You're right. We still
don't know anything for sure.

12:53.682 --> 12:54.734
I'm sorry.

12:57.136 --> 12:58.955
He wanted Andy
to move in with us?

12:58.956 --> 13:01.219
Yeah, he did.
I feel terrible.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.770
- He's really taking this hard.
- You said no, right?

13:03.771 --> 13:08.205
Of course. I just...
wish I didn't have to.

13:08.416 --> 13:11.289
Well, there's no way we can have
two kids whose hormones are exploding

13:11.290 --> 13:13.134
living together
under our roof.

13:14.225 --> 13:16.117
No one can just disappear.

13:16.237 --> 13:18.540
We should go back
and take a look around.

13:18.550 --> 13:21.151
I think we're too late. Nicole's
already scrubbed the place,

13:21.186 --> 13:22.862
and Josh and Andy
have cleaned it.

13:25.085 --> 13:26.559
But you were there
that night.

13:27.595 --> 13:31.823
- You're a witness.
- Kyle, Sarah was gone when I got back.

13:31.824 --> 13:34.695
- I didn't see anything.
- You don't know if you saw anything.

13:35.063 --> 13:37.833
But if you access your holographic
memory, you might find a clue.

13:37.856 --> 13:40.122
- I don't know how to do that.
- I'll walk you through it.

13:40.159 --> 13:43.877
You can recall your experiences from that night and examine your memories.

13:44.441 --> 13:47.608
- I don't know.
- I'll be right here for you.

13:55.825 --> 13:56.758
OK.

14:00.367 --> 14:02.846
- How do I do it?
- You just need to focus.

14:08.580 --> 14:11.096
- Nothing is happening.
- Just relax.

14:11.115 --> 14:13.649
- I am relaxed.
- More relaxed.

14:13.658 --> 14:14.785
No.

14:17.771 --> 14:20.439
- You should get in my tub.
- Really?

14:21.958 --> 14:23.188
It helps me.

14:33.688 --> 14:34.911
Lay back.

14:40.982 --> 14:43.655
OK. Are you ready?

14:45.981 --> 14:47.348
Close your eyes.

14:49.008 --> 14:50.837
Concentrate on the night
you left Latnok

14:50.872 --> 14:52.370
and went back
to the apartment.

15:01.015 --> 15:04.593
<i>I went inside.
It was dark.</i>

15:05.186 --> 15:07.281
<i>- Quiet.
- Sarah?</i>

15:10.713 --> 15:13.492
You're OK.
I'm here with you.

15:13.896 --> 15:15.427
What happens next?

15:17.962 --> 15:19.361
<i>I saw the letter.</i>

15:22.344 --> 15:24.044
<i>I read the letter.</i>

15:25.711 --> 15:27.429
<i>She said she left.</i>

15:28.566 --> 15:30.622
<i>She couldn't be
my mother anymore.</i>

15:31.666 --> 15:33.844
But Sarah didn't write
the letter. Remember?

15:33.868 --> 15:36.447
- Cassidy did.
- Cassidy.

15:37.846 --> 15:39.555
You saw him that night, too.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.530
That's when we met.

15:43.873 --> 15:45.541
<i>He was friendly.</i>

15:45.542 --> 15:48.890
<i>Relaxed.
He had his dog with him.</i>

15:48.891 --> 15:51.193
- Nothing strange.
- Then you left to help me.

15:51.194 --> 15:53.857
And I met Cassidy
when we were at Latnok.

15:56.395 --> 15:57.558
What is it?

15:59.089 --> 16:01.112
When I got back
to the apartment,

16:01.670 --> 16:04.215
Cassidy was already there,
in the hall.

16:05.347 --> 16:08.121
He got back from Latnok
so quickly, ahead of me.

16:08.122 --> 16:09.870
Why would he have to rush?

16:11.092 --> 16:12.959
What did you see
when you got back?

16:20.550 --> 16:23.943
<i>- Sorry.
- He was going to do his laundry.</i>

16:25.450 --> 16:28.671
<i>He's just standing there,
holding the basket.</i>

16:28.684 --> 16:30.304
There has to be something.

16:42.318 --> 16:43.961
- What is it?
What did you see?

16:45.319 --> 16:46.277
Blood.

16:49.149 --> 16:50.576
Jessi, are you OK?

16:52.450 --> 16:53.842
You're burning up.

17:02.951 --> 17:05.871
- How is she doing?
- We couldn't...

17:07.700 --> 17:10.699
She's still running
a fever: 101.3,

17:10.700 --> 17:12.700
down from 102
a couple of minutes ago,

17:12.719 --> 17:14.799
but up from 100.8
at the hour.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.584
Like a human thermometer.
That can become in handy.

17:18.500 --> 17:22.071
- Poor thing.
- Why won't it go down?

17:22.099 --> 17:25.400
Well, a fever is just the body
fighting off an illness.

17:25.438 --> 17:28.700
Not as long as it doesn't get too high,
it's good that she's sleeping it off.

17:29.460 --> 17:31.301
People get sick.
It happens.

17:31.319 --> 17:33.214
Not really to you
and Jessi, but...

17:33.219 --> 17:36.096
There's no other
physiological signs of illness.

17:36.115 --> 17:38.059
That can happen
with a virus.

17:41.231 --> 17:42.142
What is it?

17:43.691 --> 17:46.498
Jessi and I discovered some
new information about Sarah.

17:46.526 --> 17:49.456
I don't think she abandoned
Jessi. Something happened to her.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.920
She's been really upset
about it. And then the fever.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.246
So you think her illness
is psychosomatic?

17:56.429 --> 17:59.997
Yes. But how do I treat
a psychosomatic problem?

18:00.397 --> 18:03.732
We might be able to help her with therapy,
but we need to get her fever down first.

18:03.768 --> 18:06.331
Right.
Treat the symptoms.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.964
I think I have an idea.

18:13.527 --> 18:14.626
It's OK.

18:20.729 --> 18:23.084
I've seen how rowdy my sister
can get on a sugar rush.

18:23.123 --> 18:26.624
- Probably not a good idea to feed the animals.
- All part of my plan.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.699
Lock the door behind me,
'cause I'm going in.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.330
You're a brave man, Declan.
It's been a pleasure knowing ya.

18:35.969 --> 18:40.187
Now, listen,
this whole thing is my fault.

18:40.307 --> 18:43.037
I was in a bad place,
I was drunk and I kissed her.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.219
I shouldn't have done it,
but I did and now it's done.

18:45.229 --> 18:48.479
- You guys work out your differences.
- Thanks, traitor muffin.

18:48.497 --> 18:51.328
But no carbs for me.
It's bikini season.

18:51.347 --> 18:55.543
Oh, it's not to eat. You two should just get
your aggression out the way you usually do.

18:55.572 --> 18:59.101
One flavored soda.
Flavored syrup. Need I go on?

18:59.119 --> 19:01.592
You're not seriously suggesting
we have a food fight.

19:01.611 --> 19:04.849
- Seemed like it helped before.
- What would help

19:04.868 --> 19:09.078
is if some people didn't jump to conclusions
and call their best friend a slut.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.506
Best friends don't
break the girl code.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.631
He just said it was his fault.
Why won't you even accept it?

19:14.650 --> 19:17.611
I'll accept it when you admit
that you wanted it to happen.

19:17.618 --> 19:19.800
- Bring it.
- It is on.

19:21.741 --> 19:23.488
- Thanks, man.
- Any time.

19:23.877 --> 19:28.506
- Psst! Hey, Declan.
- What are you doing here?

19:28.515 --> 19:30.456
Might've asked around,
I heard you hang out here.

19:32.025 --> 19:33.980
- Is that weird?
- A little.

19:34.325 --> 19:35.893
But in a good way.

19:37.201 --> 19:40.290
Um, why are they
staring at us?

19:41.563 --> 19:44.477
They're, um...
going through a thing.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.054
Uh, care to join me
over here?

19:51.195 --> 19:52.807
I don't think
this is all for show.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.706
- I think he really likes her.
- I know.

19:55.826 --> 19:58.887
- He's got the Trager gaze.
- The what?

19:59.844 --> 20:02.886
Well, that's what I called it
when he looked at you that way.

20:02.905 --> 20:06.224
- It's kinda dorky.
- Jealous.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.346
You wish he was looking
at you like that.

20:08.599 --> 20:10.132
- Do not.
- Do too.

20:10.141 --> 20:12.856
- Do not.
- Do too.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.796
All right, fine.
You know what?

20:14.916 --> 20:17.526
I did want him to look at me
with that stupid moony look.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.859
I even thought he and I
might have something.

20:20.375 --> 20:23.700
But I let it fizzle out...
because of you.

20:24.686 --> 20:27.082
- You did?
- Because you're more important to me

20:27.098 --> 20:31.005
than any guy, no matter
how great his arms are.

20:33.472 --> 20:35.971
What are we doing? We've
been fighting for weeks

20:35.977 --> 20:39.313
over something Declan started
and now he's completely moved on.

20:39.604 --> 20:42.660
I see your point.
Instead of fighting,

20:43.205 --> 20:45.818
we should be figuring out
ways to make him suffer.

20:46.053 --> 20:47.221
Yeah.

20:49.489 --> 20:52.287
Let's find a way out
of here and crash his date.

21:00.606 --> 21:03.547
I never thought I'd see your
tub being used as an actual tub.

21:03.569 --> 21:06.217
- Her temperature's still not dropping.
- We just put the ice in.

21:06.252 --> 21:07.659
Give it a little time.

21:09.931 --> 21:14.325
Do you think she knows,
deep down, that Sarah's not OK?

21:15.678 --> 21:16.938
It's possible.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.887
Her reaction, the fever,

21:19.650 --> 21:22.889
maybe her body is fighting
her deep-rooted anxiety

21:22.924 --> 21:24.650
if it were
some kind of infection.

21:25.341 --> 21:27.201
Almost like she knows
what happened.

21:28.562 --> 21:32.630
- What if she does?
- You mean, like a suppressed memory?

21:33.007 --> 21:36.500
What if Jessi witnessed something,
something she doesn't want to admit?

21:36.850 --> 21:40.117
Kyle, in my experience, if she's
gone to such great lengths to deny it,

21:40.136 --> 21:42.530
- she won't want to go back there.
- I could go with her.

21:42.893 --> 21:45.513
I could access her memories,
if she lets me.

21:45.866 --> 21:49.011
Kyle, what you're talking about, even
if I could wrap my head around it, I...

21:49.027 --> 21:50.852
I'm not sure
it's the best way.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.718
I know it's extreme.
But I have to help her.

21:54.357 --> 21:56.263
I have to try everything I can.

22:00.081 --> 22:01.348
OK.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.731
Definitely not
getting out that way.

22:09.711 --> 22:11.843
Looks like it's
gonna be up and over.

22:14.850 --> 22:18.798
- Ew, it's dirty up here!
- Revenge is dirty work.

22:26.650 --> 22:28.530
Oh, my shirt!

22:28.650 --> 22:32.229
Or maybe you should think twice before
leaving the house with half an outfit.

22:32.238 --> 22:35.788
Excuse me, Lori, I didn't know
I should dress for hijinks.

22:44.976 --> 22:48.431
I so don't feel
fabulous right now.

22:49.645 --> 22:51.251
Not your best moment, no.

22:53.176 --> 22:56.340
Jessi, I want to help you.

22:57.020 --> 23:00.062
I can try and access your memories,
but I need your permission.

23:00.604 --> 23:01.948
I just want to sleep...

23:01.969 --> 23:05.093
Sleeping won't help you
feel better. This might.

23:06.008 --> 23:08.083
- I don't want to...
- We should try.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.421
Remember,
I'm still here with you.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.529
All right.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.467
What is it?

23:49.843 --> 23:52.050
I feel like
I'm invading her privacy.

23:52.595 --> 23:54.839
She's remembering all
these moments that she's...

23:55.150 --> 23:56.649
...that she's had with me.

23:56.650 --> 23:59.799
Well, sometimes people hide
disturbing thoughts or emotions

23:59.808 --> 24:01.850
with ones that calm them.

24:02.250 --> 24:05.532
Almost like a child puts a
blanket over a stuffed animal

24:05.541 --> 24:07.660
that frightens them
when it's time to go to sleep.

24:08.101 --> 24:11.330
- So I'm the blanket.
- But you can't be forever.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.765
Not if you want her
to face her memories.

24:16.819 --> 24:21.485
- They must be very intense.
- Kyle, you don't have to be the one to do this.

24:22.839 --> 24:25.205
Yes, I do.

24:30.908 --> 24:32.354
I want to keep trying.

24:35.250 --> 24:36.850
I'll leave you alone
for a little while.

24:37.950 --> 24:38.750
Thanks.

24:45.096 --> 24:46.900
Jessi, I want to try again.

24:47.238 --> 24:48.871
I need you to help me.

24:49.801 --> 24:53.796
Think of a time when
you were happy, safe.

24:55.150 --> 24:57.250
Focus on that memory
and I'll be there.

25:10.350 --> 25:13.853
- You're here.
- I said I would be.

25:16.750 --> 25:20.081
- This is nice.
- It is.

25:21.023 --> 25:23.023
And I know you
don't want to leave.

25:24.950 --> 25:27.921
But I have to, don't I?

25:38.630 --> 25:40.058
I'll stay with you.

25:49.850 --> 25:51.243
Whenever you're ready.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.364
You have to be
the one who takes us.

26:16.650 --> 26:19.249
<i>- Trager, what are you up to?
- Hils and I made up.</i>

26:19.250 --> 26:21.912
<i>We want you to come outside
so we can thank you.</i>

26:22.127 --> 26:24.630
OK. Where are you guys at?

26:24.653 --> 26:26.850
<i>What are you talking about?
We're outside on the patio.</i>

26:28.250 --> 26:30.433
- Where?
- Behind you.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.302
Open it, Trager. Open it!

26:45.450 --> 26:48.349
- Hi.
- Cute little blonde thing.

26:48.369 --> 26:50.039
We need to talk.

26:56.350 --> 26:58.449
Behold the species,
boyfriend.

26:58.450 --> 27:02.145
A rare breed, prone to strange
and erratic behavior.

27:02.169 --> 27:03.349
Nothing erratic about what I'm doing.

27:03.350 --> 27:06.325
You spending your little paycheck
on fake tattoos and superballs.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.150
You don't think
that's a little off?

27:09.483 --> 27:10.469
Got it.

27:17.050 --> 27:19.563
Andromeda Summer Faith Jensen,

27:20.925 --> 27:22.230
will you marry me?

27:29.995 --> 27:32.169
- Well?
- Well...

27:33.007 --> 27:36.209
- Are you serious?
- Totally, 100 percent.

27:36.950 --> 27:38.770
I love you
and I want to get married.

27:39.850 --> 27:43.170
What kind of... idiot,
asinine idea is that?

27:43.189 --> 27:46.112
The only kind that will
keep you from leaving me.

27:46.745 --> 27:49.750
Come on.
You've lost your mind.

27:49.773 --> 27:51.800
Why? Why is it so crazy?

27:52.550 --> 27:55.207
I could write an encyclopedia
on why it's crazy.

27:55.216 --> 27:58.450
Well, start writing, because
I'm not taking no for an answer.

28:01.207 --> 28:03.751
You might not believe this,
but I'm quite the coffee brewer.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.460
You're right,
I don't believe you.

28:07.050 --> 28:10.129
- No! You can't do this.
- But you questioned my skills.

28:10.138 --> 28:12.429
You can't come back here.
What if my boss comes back?

28:12.464 --> 28:14.645
Then he'll get the best
cappuccino he's ever tasted.

28:17.350 --> 28:19.227
Hey, I've seen one
of these symbols before.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.549
Kyle has a ring
with this on it.

28:23.550 --> 28:26.342
- That's impossible.
- No, I'm pretty positive.

28:26.369 --> 28:27.847
He got it
from his birth father.

28:27.869 --> 28:30.349
- Kyle was adopted?
- By the Tragers, yeah.

28:30.350 --> 28:32.929
- Who's his birth father?
- I don't know.

28:32.969 --> 28:35.750
- Adam something.
- Adam.

28:35.850 --> 28:38.247
- Adam Baylin?
- You know what?

28:38.269 --> 28:42.372
I shouldn't even be talking
about this. It's Kyle's business.

28:49.550 --> 28:50.949
What is that sound?

28:50.950 --> 28:52.198
I don't know.

28:54.350 --> 28:57.049
It sounds like
butterfly wings.

28:57.050 --> 28:58.898
Jessi, you said
you saw blood.

29:01.150 --> 29:04.500
Yes. In the laundry basket.

29:05.050 --> 29:07.005
On a towel
stuffed down at the bottom.

29:08.150 --> 29:09.850
We can stop if you need to.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.990
No, I can do this.

29:21.850 --> 29:23.689
I don't see anything else.

29:24.650 --> 29:26.349
Try looking
at the memory differently.

29:26.350 --> 29:30.250
At crime scenes, detectives use
ultraviolet lights to view evidence.

29:33.950 --> 29:36.862
You mean
blood evidence, right?

29:37.821 --> 29:38.788
Yes.

29:40.050 --> 29:41.450
Are you OK?

29:47.450 --> 29:49.705
We can do the same
by adjusting our vision

29:50.850 --> 29:54.731
to display the ultraviolet part of the
spectrum our eyes normally can't see.

29:56.950 --> 29:58.150
I'll try.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.310
It's working.

30:06.950 --> 30:08.351
I see something.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.236
It's more blood.

30:22.450 --> 30:23.717
And more.

30:31.234 --> 30:32.250
Jessi!

30:35.550 --> 30:36.750
Jessi!

30:38.550 --> 30:39.850
Is it OK?

30:43.345 --> 30:46.171
Right this way... ???

30:46.175 --> 30:48.049
- I'm sorry.
- Is she OK?

30:48.050 --> 30:50.349
We're stopping.
Don't worry. We're done.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.849
- It's OK.
- That's it. I'm calling a doctor.

30:52.850 --> 30:56.049
It's OK, Jessi. We're not going back.
We'll figure this out another way.

30:56.050 --> 30:57.083
No.

31:03.970 --> 31:06.486
She's in there.
She's in his apartment.

31:06.815 --> 31:09.665
- Jessi, stop.
- Help me! I need to get in there.

31:09.669 --> 31:11.449
You can't, it's a memory.
It's already happened.

31:11.450 --> 31:14.367
No! Let go of me.
I can help! Sarah!

31:14.370 --> 31:17.083
- Sarah!
- Jessi, please. Stop.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.850
Stop. OK.

31:20.115 --> 31:21.326
What is that?

31:25.016 --> 31:27.138
What? Do you know what it is?

31:28.907 --> 31:30.749
- You do.
- Jessi...

31:30.750 --> 31:32.501
What? I don't...

31:34.888 --> 31:36.954
No. No!

31:36.964 --> 31:39.050
- Maybe it's not.
- It's a heartbeat.

31:39.408 --> 31:41.393
It's Sarah's heartbeat.

31:42.796 --> 31:44.581
Why didn't I recognize it?

31:48.750 --> 31:51.430
Because it's slower
than it should be.

31:51.650 --> 31:54.255
- Kyle, she's dying in there!
- Look at me.

31:54.269 --> 31:56.049
- I can't!
- Look at me!

31:56.059 --> 31:58.134
Look at me.
Don't look away.

31:58.688 --> 31:59.730
I'm right here.

32:02.098 --> 32:03.497
It's just you and me.

32:04.786 --> 32:07.148
- Kyle...
- I know. I know.

32:07.268 --> 32:08.554
Just stay with me.

32:29.887 --> 32:30.751
No!

32:32.050 --> 32:35.449
He killed her!
I was here all along!

32:35.480 --> 32:38.864
- And I didn't save her!
- You couldn't. You didn't know.

32:41.141 --> 32:42.568
She's dead.

32:44.180 --> 32:46.116
My mother is dead.

33:36.053 --> 33:37.944
I don't know
what they said but it wasn't...

33:41.440 --> 33:43.860
Apparently, it wasn't
what I thought it would be.

33:44.082 --> 33:45.303
I'll call you.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.979
OK, so she's kind of adorable.

33:51.980 --> 33:54.179
You've always been a sucker
for cute and smart.

33:54.180 --> 33:56.279
- We wanted to sabotage you.
- We did.

33:56.280 --> 33:59.979
But then when we were trying to
explain to her what a jerk you were...

33:59.980 --> 34:03.179
We realized it was pretty sweet of
you to get us to patch things up.

34:03.180 --> 34:05.645
Does this mean you two
are back on track?

34:05.980 --> 34:08.379
Looks like your dirty
double-cross served its purpose.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.304
Well, watching you guys fight
was breaking my heart,

34:11.580 --> 34:14.083
even if it did
inflate my ego a little.

34:14.099 --> 34:16.690
- Oh!
- It was so not about you.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.442
I'm just glad you two
are friends again.

34:20.114 --> 34:22.378
But if that blonde
little bimbo hurts you...

34:22.399 --> 34:24.246
Just say the word
and we'll crush her.

34:38.753 --> 34:41.495
Don't worry. I'm OK.

34:43.487 --> 34:46.745
I never could get used to Kyle
seeing through me all the time,

34:47.309 --> 34:50.862
- but with two of you, I guess now I'll have to.
- I guess.

34:53.880 --> 34:57.691
I know you had to relive
something today, Jessi.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.921
Something that you saw
that was really bad.

35:02.409 --> 35:04.174
You don't have
to tell me about it.

35:04.972 --> 35:07.679
- I will. I just...
- It's too much right now.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.842
- And that's OK.
- One day, I'll tell you.

35:11.180 --> 35:13.742
- I promise.
- When you're ready.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.676
And whenever that is, I promise
I'll still be around to hear it.

35:19.195 --> 35:20.660
I'm not going anywhere.

35:23.448 --> 35:25.692
I guess you can
see through me, too.

35:27.322 --> 35:29.172
I want to be here for you.

35:30.590 --> 35:31.661
You are.

35:45.803 --> 35:49.183
- Can we talk about it?
- Not until your answer is yes.

35:50.110 --> 35:52.513
Then it'll be a hundred
years of silent solitude.

35:57.701 --> 35:59.128
Fine, I'll talk.

36:00.677 --> 36:02.105
I'm sorry, OK?

36:02.695 --> 36:04.206
I know you meant well,

36:04.704 --> 36:07.821
but getting married
won't solve our problems.

36:09.215 --> 36:11.124
In fact, I think our
collective three moms and a dad

36:11.133 --> 36:15.065
would probably kill you, and then
me, and then probably you again.

36:19.203 --> 36:22.029
Seriously? This is
how you're gonna be?

36:34.430 --> 36:37.179
- What the hell is your problem?
- Finally, he speaks!

36:37.180 --> 36:39.901
Yeah, and here's
what he has to say!

36:42.634 --> 36:43.559
No...

36:43.980 --> 36:45.916
...you... didn't.

36:51.930 --> 36:55.080
This is gonna stink later!

36:58.743 --> 37:01.592
You see, this is the
Josh I'm gonna miss.

37:18.783 --> 37:20.351
Do I want to know?

37:21.725 --> 37:22.780
On my room.

37:22.806 --> 37:24.460
Since when do you want
to go to your room?

37:24.471 --> 37:26.952
Even when I send you,
you don't go to your room.

37:26.980 --> 37:29.980
- It's just been a long day.
- Too long for a G-Force marathon?

37:30.647 --> 37:32.685
Come on,
I'll let you kick my ass.

37:37.919 --> 37:40.219
I said ass
and I get nothin'?

37:47.223 --> 37:48.350
Josh...

37:50.307 --> 37:51.801
Lot more to do.

38:11.699 --> 38:14.488
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:21.580 --> 38:25.709
- How do you feel?
- Exhausted.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.447
Drained.

38:28.701 --> 38:30.522
But a little bit free.

38:31.874 --> 38:32.832
Good.

38:34.742 --> 38:36.281
You didn't tell Nicole.

38:37.070 --> 38:39.361
I don't think anyone
should know about this yet.

38:39.896 --> 38:42.193
- I know it's not over.
- No.

38:42.199 --> 38:44.419
We need to find out
why he did it.

38:44.447 --> 38:45.724
We will.

38:47.452 --> 38:51.029
But... there's something
I want you to see.

38:52.701 --> 38:53.631
What is it?

38:54.654 --> 38:57.152
There's a service
that backs up cell phone data.

38:57.180 --> 39:00.142
- Even disposable cell phones.
- Like Sarah's?

39:00.262 --> 39:02.092
- I found her records.
- You did?

39:02.099 --> 39:06.940
The call records lead nowhere.
But... there were pictures she took.

39:08.201 --> 39:09.403
Of what?

39:12.980 --> 39:13.980
You.

39:23.380 --> 39:26.008
<i>Memories are our way
of keeping the past alive.</i>

39:26.380 --> 39:29.389
<i>Some are so painful we never
wanna visit them again.</i>

39:29.880 --> 39:32.010
<i>But a memory
can also be a gift,</i>

39:32.580 --> 39:36.266
<i>something we can open again and again in
orderer to fill ourselves with happiness.</i>

41:05.780 --> 41:09.280
<i>And sometimes a moment becomes a
memory the instant it's happening</i>

41:10.680 --> 41:12.336
<i>because it is so true,</i>

41:12.980 --> 41:16.355
<i>so pure and so significant,</i>

41:17.480 --> 41:19.453
<i>you want to
capture it forever.</i>

42:29.080 --> 42:30.980
- Nate?
- What's up?

42:31.887 --> 42:33.879
You seen anyone hangin' around in my office?

42:33.880 --> 42:36.280
Actually, I caught Jessi
in there this morning.

42:36.770 --> 42:37.580
Jessi!?

42:37.680 --> 42:38.779
Why? Is something wrong?

42:38.780 --> 42:41.780
No, no. Just curious.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.680
Sorry to interrupt.
Have a good night.

42:44.180 --> 42:45.079
Good night.
