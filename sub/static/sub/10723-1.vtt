00:35.302 --> 00:37.703
Man: What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.272
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.207
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.176
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.412
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.514
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.549
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.671
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.387
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.556
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.092
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.361
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.530
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.665
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.701
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.137
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.473
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.608
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

01:16.610 --> 01:20.345
What we do is legal,
therefore, it is not unethical.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.781
If this was unethical,
it would be illegal.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.583
That company mantra
was the only thing

01:24.585 --> 01:27.586
fending off this latest
bout of moral crisis.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.588
You see, I just sold this guy

01:29.590 --> 01:31.323
and his two financial gurus

01:31.325 --> 01:34.093
on investing $200 million
in our mortgage fund.

01:34.829 --> 01:37.229
He will lose almost everything.

01:37.231 --> 01:40.466
My firm will make $26 million.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.701
And it's totally legal.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.703
Therefore, it is not unethical.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.678
At a young age, it occurred
to me that I was different.

01:52.680 --> 01:56.849
You see, it's always been easier for me to
relate intellectually as opposed to emotionally.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.650
While most children
were playing pretend,

01:58.652 --> 02:00.752
I focused my efforts
on counting to 100.

02:01.689 --> 02:05.224
For Halloween, I departed from the
traditional superhero or ghoul,

02:06.160 --> 02:10.596
and instead dressed as seven-time
mathlete champion, Franklin Stubbs.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.566
In high school, I divided my time
between "The Wall Street Journal"

02:14.568 --> 02:16.435
and classic literature.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.838
By 16, I had a life plan
mapped out to my 65th birthday.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.141
After a freak
Segway-ing accident...

02:22.143 --> 02:24.510
landed me
in the college infirmary,

02:24.511 --> 02:27.431
I had my heart stolen by a sympathetic
coed working on her nursing degree.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.349
Somehow, she found
my idiosyncrasies endearing.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.418
Eight years
and two business degrees later,

02:33.420 --> 02:34.720
I landed in finance.

02:34.722 --> 02:38.323
We hate Wall Street!
We hate Wall Street!

02:38.325 --> 02:40.526
Man: To survive the
crash, I worked overtime.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.361
Some nights, I slept there.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.762
I had goals to reach.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.198
I got the car, bought the house,

02:46.200 --> 02:48.233
then worked my way up
to vice president.

02:48.235 --> 02:50.469
After this deal,
they'd make me a partner.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.840
Overnight, our firm
was gonna be worth three-fold.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.809
To celebrate, the top brass
threw a party in my honor.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.479
It didn't occur to them that I
neither drink nor enjoy bars,

03:00.481 --> 03:03.315
but being the man of the hour, I
was forced to make an appearance

03:03.317 --> 03:05.651
and enjoy
my 18-dollar virgin tonic.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.554
Jim! Jim, my man!

03:08.556 --> 03:10.622
How you doing?
You having a good time, huh?

03:10.624 --> 03:14.293
I just wanna say
excellent work. Top notch.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.596
- What we asked of you was not easy.
- Thank you.

03:17.598 --> 03:20.199
You enjoy yourself
because you deserve it.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.884
I... I am.

03:21.885 --> 03:23.568
Unfortunately, it is about
time for me to head out.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.571
- No!
- Becky leaves for work in 45 minutes,

03:25.573 --> 03:27.873
and she'll be disappointed
if I don't see her off.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.758
Listen, good for you.

03:29.759 --> 03:31.642
Before you go, let's get a
picture with Phil and Hal.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.545
Don't you move. Don't move.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.548
Jim: Today's mark was an
eccentric billionaire.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.217
But I had spent
the last six years

03:38.219 --> 03:39.851
talking people
out of their money,

03:39.853 --> 03:42.888
banks, college endowments,
teachers' pension funds.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.558
If there was a nickel to be had,
it was my job to get it.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.759
When the guilt piled up,

03:47.761 --> 03:49.761
I buried it with my ambition.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.003
If I climbed high enough,
maybe I could outrun it.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.027
- Jim, how are you?
- Good.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.369
- Jim.
- Come on in.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.370
Take a seat.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.838
How is Becky?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.406
Uh, she's... She's great.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.875
We're trying to start a family.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.778
Good. Good.
That's really great, Jim.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.280
We're gonna let you go, Jim.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.482
- Come on, Hal.
- Show a little tact, Hal.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.750
Cut the crap,
and tell him why he's here.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.485
But we just went public
with the mortgage fund.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.521
Hey, your work on that
was top notch, Jim.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.072
The bonds are under water.

04:18.074 --> 04:19.624
It's just a matter of time
before they all blow up.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.593
There was no other way
to achieve those target numbers.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.995
You were perfectly
aware of this.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.630
We gave you a number to hit.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.264
You're the one that decided
how to hit it.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.267
This is all gonna
come back on us, Jim,

04:28.269 --> 04:31.189
and believe me, it's gonna
be better for all of us...

04:31.505 --> 04:32.505
if you're not here.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.774
I was loyal,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.710
and you used me.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.645
Now, there's no reason
this can't be amicable.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.913
And no one twisted your arm.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.291
Jim: With Alpha pinning
me as the fall guy,

04:52.293 --> 04:54.660
my career in finance was over.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.795
No other firm would touch me.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.363
Hey, you're home early.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.301
So, I had
the most disgusting day today.

05:02.303 --> 05:07.306
Cresting Elementary's corn chips and
chili fry day went completely awry.

05:07.308 --> 05:11.843
A hundred and twenty fifth graders
show up spewing from both ends.

05:11.845 --> 05:15.005
We had to make an emergency run
to Home Depot for extra buckets.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.751
I bet you forgot we have dinner
with your parents tonight.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.553
Do you know
if your grandfather is coming?

05:21.555 --> 05:22.988
Because I love him,
but I just...

05:22.990 --> 05:25.390
I need to mentally
prepare myself for him.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.942
Jim: All that ladder climbing

05:26.943 --> 05:28.493
just made my fall
that much more traumatic.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.562
What's wrong?

05:30.563 --> 05:33.003
Jim: I was disgusted with myself
and repulsed by the business.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.633
I got fired.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.435
Jim: I hadn't outrun anything.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.604
So, you're...
You're happy you got fired?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.106
No. I don't know.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.675
I think I'd just like
to try something else.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.978
Well, I didn't know you had anything
other passions besides finance.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.047
Sure, I do. Plenty of things.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.450
I just need to...
find out what they are.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.088
It'll be fine, hon.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.422
I know.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.490
You'll figure it out.

05:58.492 --> 06:03.495
At least one thing is gonna get a lot
easier with you home during the day.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.764
I... I can't even think
about having babies right now.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.399
We've already had
that conversation.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.034
Yes, and now,
I don't have a job.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.068
Well, you'll find one.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.403
It could take a while.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.365
We've waited four years
to be ready.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.107
I want a baby.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.909
I want us to have a baby.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.544
I know.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.466
But I'm really not in the
right head space right now.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.051
Not even just a little?

06:27.755 --> 06:28.854
Well, that's nice.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.759
And if I do this?

06:33.761 --> 06:35.861
(sighs)
Okay, maybe when you do that.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.531
What is that?

06:39.533 --> 06:40.632
What?

06:40.634 --> 06:41.833
On your shirt.

06:43.771 --> 06:44.703
Face scrub.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.505
No, that's...

06:46.507 --> 06:48.039
That's definitely vomit.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.409
All right, well,
this shirt is coming off anyway.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.445
Oh!

06:53.881 --> 06:56.114
Jim: The career turmoil
had caused me to reflect.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.617
Not just on my own choices,

06:58.618 --> 07:01.119
but on my family's long line
of working-class forefathers.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.022
Men like my great-grandfather,
William Edward Preston.

07:04.024 --> 07:08.026
He worked his way up from small-town
butcher to East Coast farming legend.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.694
Not only did he harvest
his own crops,

07:09.696 --> 07:12.063
but he managed their distribution
across New York City

07:12.065 --> 07:14.966
and still found the time to run
a soup kitchen every Sunday.

07:14.968 --> 07:19.070
My father and grandfather built their
legacy through honest, hard work.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.956
For over 50 years,

07:20.957 --> 07:22.841
they delivered chocolate to
supermarkets across the country.

07:22.843 --> 07:26.478
From a young age, I was groomed and
expected to tread the family path.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.782
My decision to pursue finance had been
met with a... lukewarm reception.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.051
I told you not to go to work
for those crooks.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.953
They're financial managers, Dad.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.155
Grandpop Adams: Anybody
that makes all their money

07:37.157 --> 07:39.157
off other people's money
is a crook.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.092
It doesn't matter
what you call them.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.527
- Yeah, yeah.
- Case closed.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.728
Dad: Case is closed.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.497
- Case is closed.
- Case is closed.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.966
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have
another martini here, please.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.668
- Oh, that sounds great.
- Yeah.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.838
Now... here's what
we're gonna do, Jim.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.873
We're gonna put you to work
in the warehouse.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.008
Help you to start making
some honest money.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.111
You know Jim doesn't have any
interest in the warehouse, Dad.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.246
Let me see your hand, Jim.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.249
Right. Look at his hand.
Look at your son's hand.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.717
- I don't wanna look at this hand.
- Go ahead.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.735
I know what his hand looks like.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.752
Mom:
He doesn't wanna look at it.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.221
It's like a woman's.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.555
Is that a manicure?

08:10.557 --> 08:11.756
- James.
- That's enough, Dad.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.725
- I was only asking.
- No, it's enough.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.693
- I don't know what's normal these days.
- That's enough.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.163
No, I, uh...
I don't have a manicure.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.865
I like his hands.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.234
And what's wrong
with our business?

08:22.236 --> 08:25.570
It's raised this family
for two generations.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.506
- That's true.
- And I appreciate that.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.874
I just... I wanna
find my own way.

08:28.876 --> 08:29.841
Yeah.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.243
Sorry, Dad.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.510
No need to be sorry.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.846
How are you fixed for cash?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.214
We're not taking your money.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.982
They gave me a small severance.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.951
Yes, and we have some savings.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.852
So, he has some time
to figure it out.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.922
- I say we toast.
- Yes. Absolutely.

08:43.924 --> 08:44.890
To new a beginning.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.791
Excuse me, miss.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.260
Are you distilling my spirits,

08:48.262 --> 08:51.263
or am I to expect my drink
sometime this evening?

08:53.834 --> 08:55.567
Jim: For the first
time in my adult life,

08:55.569 --> 08:57.235
I was without direction.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.004
But it was time
to take inventory,

08:59.006 --> 09:01.046
discover new interests
and pursue them.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.610
♪ What if I had
just a little bit more time? ♪

09:07.047 --> 09:11.216
♪ To chase down moments like
this and make them mine ♪

09:13.654 --> 09:17.756
♪ What if this night
had never come to pass? ♪

09:19.226 --> 09:23.295
♪ How many nights like this
have I got left? ♪

09:25.299 --> 09:29.601
♪ I leave in the morning
for the country where I'm from ♪

09:29.603 --> 09:31.937
Jim: My grandfather was right.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.772
I hadn't done
any truly honest work

09:33.774 --> 09:36.808
since sweeping
the warehouse floor at 15.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.009
Alpha had plucked me
out of college.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.578
I never had to look for a job,

09:39.580 --> 09:41.646
never had to fill out
an application.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.847
Something millions of people
do every day,

09:42.849 --> 09:44.082
and I didn't have a clue.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.891
So, what mortgage derivatives does
your former employer invest in?

09:58.332 --> 10:00.298
Man (over PA): Now calling A57.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.667
Now calling A57.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.275
Hi. I'm here to see
about finding new employment.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.016
Right across the street there
is a community college.

10:18.018 --> 10:22.087
They offer what we call
job preparatory classes.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.989
You get yourself
into one of those,

10:23.991 --> 10:25.790
and I'll get you your benefits.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.659
"Making Art from Trash"?

10:27.661 --> 10:28.727
Trade skill, hon.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.630
What about "Interpretive Dance"?

10:31.632 --> 10:32.731
Personal growth.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.700
I just want a job.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.571
And we will be happy
to help you find one.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.204
Great.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.873
Just as soon
as I get you the benefits.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.052
Jim: After a six-year hiatus,

10:54.053 --> 10:55.920
I found the idea
of returning to school charming.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.962
No doubt it would provide the
spark of inspiration I needed.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.226
(wheels squeaking)

11:03.096 --> 11:05.330
Vending machines and bathrooms
are down the hall.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.132
Good luck
with your career paths.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.800
In this three-part series,

11:08.802 --> 11:12.270
we'll teach you how to find
a job using the Internet.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.407
Raise your hand if you've
ever used a computer before.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.678
Good for you.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.414
Now, let's go over the basics of
filling out an application online.

11:22.416 --> 11:26.117
First, you will want to create
a username and password.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.820
Jim: After suffering through the
No Child Left Behind program,

11:28.822 --> 11:30.722
it was time to hit the streets.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.390
I needed something blue collar,

11:32.392 --> 11:35.226
something my great-grandfather
Preston would be proud of.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.729
Society needed people
contributing on the ground floor,

11:37.731 --> 11:40.131
not middle men living off
interest rates and derivatives.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.767
My name is Jim Adams.
I'm looking for new employment.

11:42.769 --> 11:45.036
Do you have any, uh...
Do you have any job openings?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.337
(speaking Spanish)

11:48.909 --> 11:50.909
Oh, Audi? Yes.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.078
Yes, I actually...
I have an Audi.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.747
I'd love to learn more about it
and work... Here's my resume.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.215
I'm a bit overqualified, I know,

11:57.217 --> 11:59.317
but I'm really willing
to learn a new trade.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.019
This is... This is great.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.854
(speaking Spanish)

12:02.856 --> 12:04.923
- Yeah. "Try it out."
- (speaking Spanish)

12:04.925 --> 12:07.058
I would love to try it out.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.226
That's exactly
what I'm looking to do.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.095
That's... Wow, okay. Well...

12:11.031 --> 12:13.131
- So I'll just call you?
- (speaking Spanish)

12:13.133 --> 12:14.265
- I'll call...
- (speaking Spanish)

12:14.267 --> 12:15.767
- Okay?
- Okay. Wow.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.103
- All right.
- (speaking Spanish)

12:18.105 --> 12:20.866
That feels good just to
have that on my hands.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.274
- Doesn't even bother me. Doesn't even...
- Okay.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.976
- I'm excited.
- (speaking Spanish)

12:24.978 --> 12:26.177
Okay.

12:26.178 --> 12:27.377
So, what are you, a stockbroker?

12:27.380 --> 12:28.513
I worked in the bond market.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.265
That's not a stockbroker?

12:30.266 --> 12:32.016
No. No, sir. I've never been
licensed to sell securities.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.218
You ever do work
like this before?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.253
I have not,
but I am a quick learner.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.805
I'm sure you are.

12:36.806 --> 12:39.206
But we don't have the time
or the personnel to train you.

12:39.826 --> 12:40.826
Thank you.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.395
I could start by sweeping up.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.897
My kid does that already.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.869
Here is my resume.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.991
Well, if it doesn't say you've
ever cut, sold, or laid carpet...

12:55.408 --> 12:57.528
you might as well
put it back in your purse.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.013
This is an attache case.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.015
Thank you.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.885
Jim: It had been three weeks.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.187
And after hand delivering
57 applications,

13:09.189 --> 13:13.391
I had managed to secure nothing more
than an appointment for an oil change.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.313
Maybe I was doomed to be a
white-collar desk jockey.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.914
Waffle fact.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.117
With more than 1,700 locations,
all open 24 hours,

13:39.119 --> 13:43.254
Papa's Chicken and Waffle is the seventh
largest food chain in the United States.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.124
During my college heyday,
Papa's was a late-night staple

13:46.126 --> 13:48.827
and a place
I could always clear my head.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.228
Just seeing the establishment provided
more comfort than I had felt in months.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.201
(oldies music playing)

13:56.203 --> 13:57.203
Yeah.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.575
Yeah.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.309
- Just have a seat. She'll be right with you.
- Okay.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.012
You are right, man. That has
definitely got something.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.848
It's called groove, baby,

14:09.850 --> 14:11.616
and not a lot
of those new cats have it.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.551
- (laughing)
- I'm with you, bro.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.121
How much is the Wanda?

14:17.123 --> 14:22.060
Same price as it was yesterday,
Kathy, $9.72 with taxes.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.461
Hey, Mary!

14:23.463 --> 14:24.896
Where you at, girl?

14:24.898 --> 14:27.098
I mean, people are dying
of starvation out here.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.351
Coming!

14:29.352 --> 14:32.472
Come on now! I can't be grilling
and greeting at the same time.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.640
I will have the Wanda.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.574
Coming up.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.476
- Wanda!
- Wanda's working.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.111
What can I get you?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.993
Orange juice, Wyatt with
cheese, and an application.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.318
What do you mean?
You wanna work here?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.920
Are you still hiring?

14:48.922 --> 14:50.388
We're always hiring.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.356
It's my third time working here.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.991
Lord help us.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.926
Fill this out.
I'll get a manager.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.888
- There's only four questions.
- Yeah.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.498
I guess I just expected it
to be longer.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.900
Not at Papa's.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.568
Hey, hey,
what's the man's order?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.204
And call it out on the bird.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.607
Wyatt with cheese.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.076
Copy that. Wyatt with cheese.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.278
Coming on the fly.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.947
You like working here?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.649
(chuckles) It's not "Top Chef,"

15:17.651 --> 15:19.550
but it keeps me
on the grill, baby.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.985
Woman:
You looking for a job, honey?

15:20.987 --> 15:22.153
You're the manager.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.322
- Assistant. Jacqui.
- I'm Jim Adams.

15:24.324 --> 15:28.092
Well, Mr. Jim Adams, you
certainly do dress to impress.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.928
You ever work
in a restaurant before?

15:29.930 --> 15:32.363
- I haven't.
- I didn't think so.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.631
What was your last job?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.366
Well, I've always worked
in finance,

15:35.368 --> 15:36.601
but I'm seeking a career change.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.987
Preferably honest work.

15:38.988 --> 15:41.372
Something that gives back, something that,
when I go home at the end of the day,

15:41.374 --> 15:43.241
I can still have
a sense of dignity.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.443
Well, all I need is a server.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.511
Two of them just quit.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.146
Well, one of the got hauled off,

15:48.148 --> 15:50.982
but nobody got time
for all that.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.150
You think you can handle it?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.718
I'd welcome the opportunity.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.219
Is that a yes?

15:55.221 --> 15:56.654
A resounding yes.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.693
Mary, grab Jim
one of those new-hire packets.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.127
Mary: Got it.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.595
Can you start
tomorrow 8:00 a.m.?

16:04.597 --> 16:05.630
I can.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.182
Good answer.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.733
Now, manager Matt
will be on duty.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.086
So you make sure
you make me look good,

16:11.087 --> 16:13.438
and you go home and you familiarize
yourself with the Rise and Shine manual.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.372
Of course.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.074
Oh, and, Jim, baby,

16:16.076 --> 16:17.576
wear jeans.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.657
People who dress like that end
up getting mugged around here.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.024
It doesn't really hurt much.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.192
Oh, okay.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.126
I was wondering about that.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.194
Yeah.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.438
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.101
Best of luck.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.219
I'm sure they, uh...

16:44.220 --> 16:45.336
they deal with this sort
of thing all the time.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.138
Yeah, thanks.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.306
Okay.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.345
Everything all right?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.446
Yeah, yeah, fine.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.348
I thought the ER creeps you out.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.349
Still does.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.752
I had some news
I wanted to share with you.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.520
An opportunity
has presented itself,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.482
and I just...
I couldn't pass it up.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.525
Okay, now, I'm getting excited.
What is it?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.160
Papa's Chicken and Waffle.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.529
What about it?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.611
It's where I'm working.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.134
You're managing
a Papa's Chicken and Waffle?

17:16.136 --> 17:17.402
No, I'm a server.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.564
I start training tomorrow.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.306
Are you joking?

17:22.308 --> 17:24.387
No, I'm actually
kind of excited about it.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.180
Why?

17:29.182 --> 17:30.548
Because it's a fresh start.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.284
It's a chance to clear my head
and work with my hands.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.519
I really wish you would
have figured that out

17:34.521 --> 17:36.754
before we forked out
50 grand on an MBA

17:36.756 --> 17:40.425
and spent seven years traveling
around for your career in that world.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.559
So do I.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.267
Papa's Waffle? Really?

17:49.269 --> 17:51.102
Chicken and Waffle, yeah.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.105
What are you reading?

17:54.107 --> 17:55.139
I'm studying.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.341
For what?

17:57.343 --> 17:58.443
My new job.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.279
That's for waiting tables?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.714
What's in there?

18:03.716 --> 18:04.716
Sure, take a look.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.254
"During off-peak hours,

18:10.256 --> 18:11.823
"servers must
restock condiments,

18:11.825 --> 18:13.157
"mop floors...

18:14.094 --> 18:15.526
"sanitize the bathrooms."

18:15.528 --> 18:17.161
It's refreshingly regimented.

18:17.163 --> 18:20.003
You do realize those are
public bathrooms, right?

18:20.633 --> 18:21.566
Sure.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.702
Have you seen what the
public does to a bathroom?

18:27.540 --> 18:28.706
Yeah.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.308
This ought to be good.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.742
Here you go.

18:31.744 --> 18:32.810
Have fun.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.714
Thank you.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.555
Morning.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.290
How long have you been up?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.759
Since yesterday about this time.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.578
All night?

18:50.579 --> 18:53.699
Well, it's just the manager is
counting on me to have this down.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.635
You're ironing your jeans?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.339
People iron their jeans.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.707
No, they don't.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.774
You're nervous.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.310
I wouldn't say I'm nervous.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.312
Actually...

19:08.181 --> 19:09.280
it's kind of cute.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.550
This is interesting.

19:12.552 --> 19:17.755
"In order to qualify, a franchisee must
first work a minimum of 1,000 hours

19:17.757 --> 19:19.677
"at a Papa's Chicken
and Waffle."

19:20.860 --> 19:22.780
That is
an inspired business model.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.743
Let's just start by getting
through your first day.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.670
(oldies music playing)

19:46.853 --> 19:52.390
♪ Oh, my darling I have... ♪

19:52.392 --> 19:53.958
What you gonna do?

19:53.960 --> 19:54.960
Excuse me?

19:56.329 --> 19:57.395
What job?

19:58.464 --> 19:59.630
I'll be serving.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.401
What about you?

20:03.636 --> 20:04.636
Kitchen.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.876
Jim: Waffle fact.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.244
It's not something
they advertise,

20:13.246 --> 20:15.396
but Papa's Chicken and Waffle

20:15.397 --> 20:17.547
is America's third largest employer
of ex-convicts and felons,

20:17.550 --> 20:20.551
a true testament to Papa's
founder, Jason Hank Kramerson's

20:20.553 --> 20:23.421
unwavering belief in the redemptive
qualities of the human spirit.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.324
Manuel, hey,
great to have you back.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.525
What's it been, six months?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.427
Twelve. Got out early.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.861
Good behavior?

20:30.863 --> 20:32.263
Overcrowding.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.531
Well, well done.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.949
Luckily, not much
has changed around here,

20:34.950 --> 20:36.366
so we can get you
right back in the kitchen.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.636
- Cool.
- Very cool.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.671
Jim, welcome to Papa's.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.573
I'm excited to be here.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.442
I like that. You should be.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.476
Come with me.

20:45.478 --> 20:49.647
I'm not the kind of guy who likes
to sit around flapping his jaws.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.316
I like to throw you in the fire,
sink or swim.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.418
The only real way
to learn is to do.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.204
You get a chance
to look at that packet yet?

20:56.205 --> 20:57.989
Fastidiously. I even found
a few grammatical errors.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.207
I'll take that.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.208
You can make
a lot of money here, Jim.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.493
And I'm not just saying that.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.696
It was hard for me when my
construction business went under.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.032
I didn't know what to expect
when I first came on board.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.801
But I'll tell you something. You
work hard, and you produce...

21:10.803 --> 21:12.036
there is opportunity.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.372
I started out just like you.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.773
And now, I'm the store manager.
Thank you.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.441
That's very encouraging.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.976
You're damn right, it is.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.511
I like your energy, Jim.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.513
I'm gonna start you off
on the ordering process.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.015
After that,
on the register with Jacqui.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.650
Then you're gonna
follow Mary for the day.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.752
- Edward, this is Jim, our new server.
- Hey.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.887
Show him how
we get it done around here.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.455
Hey. Hey.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.057
I'm gonna throw a lot
at you, Jimmy.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.326
So you better be ready
to catch it.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.368
It's Jim.
Only my parents call me Jimmy.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.798
Well, consider me
your waffle daddy.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.301
Now, here comes the first pitch.

21:44.037 --> 21:45.537
When you call in the order,

21:45.538 --> 21:47.038
make sure you have
two feet on the tile.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.439
That's two feet square.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.841
And be certain we hear you.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.443
So, call it like
you have meaning.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.479
I need a Winnie, two Wendys,
and a Brenda Joe.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.315
Eight options on the menu.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.483
Papa had eight kids.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.052
That ain't a coincidence.

22:01.054 --> 22:04.021
Now, the boys
liked their waffles savory.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.690
And call it at the grill,

22:05.692 --> 22:09.427
and we add the chicken,
bacon, and the eggs.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.762
The girls liked them sweet.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.398
Service dress them here.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.833
Somebody want the Mama,

22:15.835 --> 22:18.502
that's one
of our specialty orders.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.704
They get the works.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.005
Ice cream in the deep freeze.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.107
Who's Brenda Joe?

22:23.109 --> 22:24.809
Oh, that's Papa's baby.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.712
Yeah, the only one who got
away with ordering pancakes.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.580
Doesn't start with a W.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.984
Um, maybe they ran out
of names with W.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.487
Whitney is one.

22:36.489 --> 22:39.457
Willy, or Wilfred,
or Wilhelmina.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.625
Hey, we ain't got time
for your semantics.

22:42.829 --> 22:43.894
Hey, Jacqui.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.598
Show Jimmy boy here
the register.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.071
Jacqui: Okay, and then you add...
Yeah, just like that.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.140
Oh. Oh, okay,
I usually do it another way,

22:56.142 --> 22:57.441
but that seems to work better.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.443
$36.38.

22:59.445 --> 23:00.728
Thank you.

23:00.729 --> 23:02.012
Now, you can use the built-in...

23:02.014 --> 23:03.094
(cash register opening)

23:04.083 --> 23:06.584
That's $37, $38, $39,

23:06.586 --> 23:09.487
and 62 cents makes $40
is your change.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.468
Calculator.

23:12.469 --> 23:13.947
Papa's thanks you
for your patronage.

23:13.948 --> 23:15.426
Hope you can come back
and see us again soon.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.161
Thank you.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.895
I have never seen anybody
take to the register like that.

23:18.898 --> 23:19.897
Thank you.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.532
Look, Jim, no offense,

23:21.534 --> 23:24.101
but you don't seem
like the Papa's Waffle type.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.604
You look more like
a school teacher or...

23:26.606 --> 23:28.406
carpet salesman.

23:28.408 --> 23:31.675
Jacqui, don't you think it's a
little soon to malign my character?

23:31.677 --> 23:33.477
What kind of shoes
are those anyway?

23:33.479 --> 23:35.980
Cordovan leather straight tips.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.748
They don't look
restaurant-friendly.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.450
Scuff-resistant,
water-repellent,

23:39.452 --> 23:42.052
guaranteed to be as versatile
as they are timeless.

23:42.054 --> 23:45.294
Price I paid for them, they better
be as friendly as a shoe can get.

23:45.691 --> 23:46.757
All right now.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.908
I'm supposed to shadow you
for the day.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.204
Okay.

24:01.107 --> 24:04.442
Jim: In his seminal work, "How to
Win Friends and Influence People,"

24:04.444 --> 24:07.511
Dale Carnegie posits that the fastest
way to make others warm to you

24:07.513 --> 24:09.613
is to encourage them
to talk about themselves.

24:09.615 --> 24:10.655
Aren't you pregnant?

24:11.551 --> 24:12.483
Yeah.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.985
I'm just finishing off
my last carton.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.058
Read any good books lately?

24:21.994 --> 24:23.978
I hate to read.

24:23.979 --> 24:25.963
The only book I've ever read
is "The Caramel Seduction."

24:25.965 --> 24:26.964
What's that about?

24:26.966 --> 24:27.965
It's erotica.

24:27.967 --> 24:32.603
(chuckling) Oh, I... thought it might
have been about Milton Hershey

24:32.605 --> 24:34.605
or some other
confectionery mogul.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.507
There's no one named Milton
in this book.

24:36.509 --> 24:37.875
Of course not.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.242
Milton is a name
best suited for economists,

24:39.245 --> 24:41.646
not Casanovas.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.048
Mary! Hey, we're going down. I need
you and Jim back on the floor ASAP.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.399
What about Cody?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.480
He had a summons.
Come on, girl. Let's go.

24:52.892 --> 24:56.227
Thank you for your business
and come again soon.

24:56.229 --> 24:57.695
Why is it like this?

24:57.697 --> 24:59.930
Afternoon rush.
Happens every day.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.533
I need you to bus table seven and
drop silver and menus at four.

25:02.535 --> 25:03.535
I'm sorry. What?

25:05.505 --> 25:07.972
Take this rag. Clean that table.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.173
Put these on it.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.511
Out of eggs. Out of cheese.
Almost out of bacon.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.913
Hey, hey, Jimmy,
we're sinking fast back here.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.915
We need a reload double time.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.252
Get to the walk-in. I need
cheese, bacon, eggs, and butter.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.454
Okay.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.655
Hey, hey, hey, we need syrup,
strawberries, walnuts, and jam too.

25:25.658 --> 25:26.690
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.192
Wait. Who covers the register?

25:28.194 --> 25:30.274
Hey, man, look,
forget about the register.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.242
What's that?

25:45.244 --> 25:46.244
It's cheese.

25:47.547 --> 25:50.714
I said, "Eggs, bacon,
butter, and cheese."

25:50.716 --> 25:52.716
It's the first thing I saw.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.819
Hey, seriously, man,
ain't you a college boy?

25:55.821 --> 25:57.688
I mean, how did
you survive your last gig?

25:57.690 --> 25:59.590
I worked with numbers
in the ether,

25:59.592 --> 26:01.959
not toppings in a freezer, okay.
I dealt in abstractions.

26:01.961 --> 26:05.763
Well, how about you
abstract more than one item?

26:05.765 --> 26:07.965
You're not handling
nitroglycerin.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.800
What's the holdup?
Where's the strawberries?

26:09.802 --> 26:11.769
Apparently, Jimmy the genius

26:11.771 --> 26:14.605
can't figure his way
past one bag of cheese.

26:14.607 --> 26:15.773
Just...

26:17.877 --> 26:19.076
Let's see...

26:22.315 --> 26:25.215
Hey, hey, Jimmy, come on! I
need you to work with me, baby!

26:25.217 --> 26:27.017
- Jim: Sorry!
- Work with me!

26:30.289 --> 26:31.255
Jimmy!

26:31.257 --> 26:32.356
Uh...

26:34.260 --> 26:37.028
- Oh!
- (clattering)

26:37.029 --> 26:40.149
Jimmy, please tell me what wasn't
my last bucket of bacon bits.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.938
Jacqui said
she mentioned the shoes.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.014
She did. Yeah.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.830
It's all right. I've seen worse.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.188
Okay.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.789
You're right. I haven't.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.192
But the important thing is
you got back up,

27:08.194 --> 27:10.160
and you finished the job.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.930
Now, as stated
in the Rise and Shine,

27:12.932 --> 27:15.213
all employees must complete
a week-long trial period.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.303
But after
what I've seen today...

27:19.305 --> 27:22.306
the ability to abandon all pride
in the line of duty...

27:23.275 --> 27:26.677
well, I know Papa's material
when I see it.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.102
You're part
of the family now, Jim.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.254
I'm honored.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.722
I know you are.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.394
Hey, I hate to do this to you,

27:43.395 --> 27:44.962
but I need you to come in a
couple hours early on Wednesday.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.197
Okay.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.431
We just got word the owner
is gonna pay us a little visit,

27:47.433 --> 27:50.434
and I need
this place to sparkle.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.271
Right.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.047
That hurts so good.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.049
I think my left leg
just went numb.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.817
- You want me to stop?
- Don't you dare.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.119
This is the only chance
I have of walking tomorrow.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.755
All right, well,
besides getting maimed,

28:11.757 --> 28:13.824
how was your first day
at making waffles?

28:13.826 --> 28:15.059
That would require a promotion.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.360
I am a server trainee.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.730
Okay, how much
did my server trainee make?

28:19.732 --> 28:24.702
Adding up my hourly wage and taking into
account the ruined shirt and slacks...

28:24.704 --> 28:26.737
I think I'm only down
about $170.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.307
You actually lost money
by going into work today?

28:30.309 --> 28:32.309
Startup costs, honey.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.391
Every business venture
is steeped in them.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.415
You might find this interesting.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.719
After seeing Mary's sales today,

28:41.721 --> 28:43.754
and assuming
Jacqui did roughly the same,

28:43.756 --> 28:46.423
I was impressed with the revenue
potential of the restaurant.

28:46.425 --> 28:49.426
I mean, considering Papa's is open
24 hours with three shifts a day,

28:49.428 --> 28:51.261
even if you factor in 70% costs,

28:51.263 --> 28:53.130
it's still a healthy profit
for the owners.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.165
More than both
of our salaries combined.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.301
Well, my old salary anyway.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.470
Yeah, it's interesting.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.272
What?

29:02.274 --> 29:03.274
You don't like it.

29:04.977 --> 29:05.977
You do like it?

29:07.913 --> 29:09.847
I missed something.

29:10.783 --> 29:11.783
Can I buy a vowel?

29:13.452 --> 29:14.985
Rhymes with...

29:16.822 --> 29:17.822
maybe.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.127
Baby.

29:23.896 --> 29:24.896
You're pregnant.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.398
You did it.

29:27.399 --> 29:28.932
No, well, you had something
to do with it.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.534
I can't believe this. This is...

29:30.536 --> 29:31.952
This is so exciting.

29:31.953 --> 29:33.369
- Is that all you have?
- No, this is really exciting.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.538
Come here.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.944
I love you.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.813
I love you.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.948
You know I'm terrified, right?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.183
I do.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.284
(laughing) I know.

29:47.286 --> 29:53.991
In nine months, we're gonna be up to our
ears in burp cloths and dirty diapers.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.259
We're gonna have
to buy a minivan.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.094
We're having a child,
not a soccer team.

29:57.096 --> 29:58.562
Is it normal
that I'm already thinking

29:58.564 --> 29:59.997
about everything
that could go wrong

29:59.999 --> 30:01.465
and everything we don't have?

30:01.467 --> 30:04.101
Yeah, I think it's called
having a child.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.536
You sure we're ready for this?

30:06.906 --> 30:09.807
You mean because at some point,
I won't be able to work,

30:09.809 --> 30:12.442
and you're only making
$2.13 an hour

30:12.444 --> 30:13.911
plus tips?

30:13.913 --> 30:15.879
Yes, that crossed my mind.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.047
Yeah, mine too.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.391
Jim:
I knew my enthusiasm for the job

30:27.393 --> 30:29.226
wouldn't make up
for the lack of take-home.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.229
With a baby inbound,
I need to make some real money.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.531
$60 a shift wasn't gonna
buy me much time.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.366
- Manuel.
- Hey, what's up, man?

30:36.368 --> 30:38.101
Oh.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.304
(laughs) It's cool, man.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.306
It's cool.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.176
Hey!

30:46.178 --> 30:48.612
You the guy who slipped
on his ass yesterday?

30:48.614 --> 30:50.080
Jim Adams, yes.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.349
Yeah. Larry, assistant manager.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.951
Those the same shoes?

30:53.953 --> 30:55.185
Yes, but I...

30:55.187 --> 30:57.154
You know I can write you up
for that.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.122
I did order a pair of Crewsave
shoes from the catalog,

30:59.124 --> 31:00.924
but they take a while to ship.

31:00.926 --> 31:03.806
Consider this your verbal warning.
You only get one.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.597
I thought Jacqui
was the assistant manager.

31:06.599 --> 31:09.066
(sighs) There's the manager,

31:09.068 --> 31:10.434
two assistant managers,

31:10.436 --> 31:12.469
and the shift manager.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.471
Well, I guess that ups the odds
for promotion, doesn't it?

31:14.473 --> 31:15.405
Yeah.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.007
For some people.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.077
Any idea what
I'm supposed to be doing?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.919
Ask Matthew. He's in the back.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.222
- Matthew?
- He's out back.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.498
Matthew:
I want us to talk about this.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.539
Woman: I'm not gonna sit here
and talk to you about this...

31:44.403 --> 31:46.270
I can't stop!

31:46.272 --> 31:48.171
You can figure this out!

31:48.173 --> 31:49.640
- Nancy...
- Whatever!

31:49.642 --> 31:50.642
Can we please...

32:01.320 --> 32:02.320
Matthew?

32:04.089 --> 32:05.255
You all right?

32:08.060 --> 32:09.626
You need anything?

32:14.400 --> 32:17.167
How about I just grab a bucket
and start on the windows?

32:19.338 --> 32:20.504
Yeah.

32:35.988 --> 32:38.622
Jimmy Flops, back again.
(chuckles)

32:38.624 --> 32:40.257
I can always count on you
to be early.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.676
Anyone serious about his job
would be.

32:42.677 --> 32:45.094
Jim, we're out of visors. I need everybody
looking as hygienic as possible.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.530
Everybody listen up!

32:46.532 --> 32:48.198
Boss man is 10 minutes out.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.734
Last looks. Let's stash
the cleaning supplies,

32:50.736 --> 32:53.816
and let's pretend we haven't been
busing our humps all morning.

33:01.580 --> 33:05.248
Hey, what are you doing
wearing that stupid-looking hat?

33:05.250 --> 33:07.217
Management told me
to keep it sexy.

33:07.219 --> 33:10.187
Just trying to fulfill the
mandate the best way I know how.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.522
Then I say...

33:12.524 --> 33:14.725
you nailed it.

33:14.727 --> 33:16.193
Thank you, Kathy.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.229
Jacqui: There he is.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.502
Every six weeks, like clockwork.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.503
That's Papa?

33:26.505 --> 33:28.739
Drake, Papa's protege.

33:28.741 --> 33:31.541
Hey, don't let the lack of
polish fool you either.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.076
He's one
of the richest guys in town.

33:33.078 --> 33:35.178
You give that old man a 10 cent,

33:35.180 --> 33:37.664
and he'll squeeze out a dollar.

33:37.665 --> 33:40.149
Jim: Miles Drake III was one of
the original five franchisees.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.468
How's my favorite...

33:41.469 --> 33:42.785
Jim: In addition to his
10 Papa's locations,

33:42.788 --> 33:45.555
he also owned a tire shop
and a beauty salon.

33:45.557 --> 33:49.559
Two artificial knees didn't stop him from
inspecting every inch of the building.

33:49.561 --> 33:53.096
No crevice was overlooked,
no detail too minute.

33:53.098 --> 33:56.066
And just when I thought my
admiration had reached its summit,

33:56.068 --> 33:57.401
he took to the grill.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.736
Cooked his own Webster
with a side of hash browns.

33:59.738 --> 34:04.241
Then sat down in booth seven to enjoy
his lunch with a cup of coffee, black.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.828
Afterward, we were called
into the back

34:07.829 --> 34:10.480
for what I anticipated to be a
hard-nosed yet inspired critique.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.250
Well, I wanna thank you all
for being here with me today.

34:14.719 --> 34:18.121
As many of you know,
I'm not a man to waste words.

34:19.324 --> 34:22.059
It's been suggested
that I slow down...

34:22.061 --> 34:24.261
and I'm gonna take that advice.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.463
Now, this doesn't mean
anything drastic.

34:26.465 --> 34:30.600
It just means that sometime in the
future, I will cease to be your boss.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.303
Jim: No sooner had he said
it than the idea struck me,

34:33.304 --> 34:37.340
so acute and clearly-defined I
might only describe it as destiny.

34:37.342 --> 34:40.702
I just want you to know it's been an
absolute pleasure to be your employer.

34:42.147 --> 34:44.187
So, get out there
and sling some waffles.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.717
Let's do it, guys. Waffle time.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.554
- You've done a great job for me, Matthew.
- Thank you, sir.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.690
Excuse me, Mr. Drake.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.559
- My name is Jim Adams.
- Hi, Jim.

34:55.561 --> 34:59.763
Um, I just was wondering if I could
have a moment to... speak to you.

35:00.833 --> 35:03.400
I want you to look at something
and tell me what you think.

35:08.307 --> 35:11.541
Please tell me you're not
trying to buy a Ferrari.

35:11.543 --> 35:15.312
It's a franchising fee and down payment
for a Papa's Chicken and Waffle.

35:15.314 --> 35:18.394
More precisely, the location at
which I am currently employed.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.885
Okay. Now, I wish
this was about a car.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.454
I know it's intimidating.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.225
$335,000?

35:29.394 --> 35:32.629
With the state of our mortgage, I
can't imagine how we would do that.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.498
Don't you think
this is a bit impulsive?

35:34.500 --> 35:36.500
I understand it could come
across as ill-considered.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.236
- Good.
- But I met the store owner today,

35:39.238 --> 35:41.438
and it could not
have been more clear.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.630
Don't you have to work
there a year or something?

35:43.655 --> 35:44.374
1,000 hours.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.309
But all corporate cares about
is a gross total,

35:46.311 --> 35:48.592
which means I can tally
as many hours as I can take.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.814
It's a huge risk.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.816
I wanna be a man
that cooks his own breakfast.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.317
Honey, I could teach you that
in an hour.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.619
We don't need
to buy a restaurant.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.721
It's good, clean, hard work,

35:57.723 --> 35:59.773
and it's respectable.

35:59.774 --> 36:01.824
It's endless hours
and a mountain of stress.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.293
My father ran his own business.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.561
I'm not naive to what it takes.

36:04.563 --> 36:07.297
No, I... (sigh) I know that.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.499
This has a lot of potential.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.234
Yes, maybe it does, but...

36:12.171 --> 36:13.470
we can't afford it.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.938
We can take out a loan.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.409
Is this really what you want?

36:19.411 --> 36:20.777
A Papa's Waffle?

36:20.779 --> 36:23.813
Just come in and see it, okay?

36:23.815 --> 36:26.316
If you're not convinced,
then I won't mention it again.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.856
You ready?

36:32.858 --> 36:33.924
Dazzle me.

36:35.194 --> 36:37.427
(conga music playing)

36:39.865 --> 36:41.398
Wow. Is it always like this?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.699
Jacqui: Jim! Jim!

36:42.701 --> 36:44.701
Oh, thank the almighty
you're here.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.536
- What is this?
- A wedding.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.737
Someone is getting married here?

36:47.739 --> 36:49.539
Happens all the time.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.707
I need your help.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.874
People are passionate
about their Papa's.

36:51.877 --> 36:57.280
Look, we've got a critical toilet
situation I need you to take care of.

36:57.282 --> 36:59.750
What do you mean "critical"?

36:59.751 --> 37:02.219
Child, the commode is clogged like
a watermelon in a garden hose.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.754
I told them that double
ply paper was a bad idea.

37:04.756 --> 37:05.922
The plunger didn't work?

37:05.924 --> 37:08.225
Stolen. That's the situation.

37:08.227 --> 37:09.459
Who steals a plunger?

37:09.461 --> 37:11.294
These people are savages.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.096
Do you want me
to go buy a new one?

37:13.097 --> 37:14.897
Two more flushes,
and it's Niagara Falls in there.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.833
Welcome
to the restaurant business.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.972
Not a problem. I'll handle it.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.246
Jimmy Jam.

37:29.248 --> 37:31.481
I wouldn't go in there raw.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.370
Oh! Wow!

37:53.372 --> 37:55.905
No. No. No, no, no, no, no.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.912
(exhaling)

38:03.915 --> 38:06.349
It's man up time. It's man up time.
It's man up time.

38:06.351 --> 38:08.685
(exhaling nervously)

38:12.591 --> 38:14.751
It's time to man up, Jim.
It's time to man up.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.495
Okay.

38:18.363 --> 38:19.763
Okay.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.399
All right, yeah,
that's significant.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.800
That is significant.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.037
(exhaling)

38:30.042 --> 38:33.777
(shuddering in disgust)

38:39.651 --> 38:40.684
Ugh!

38:46.425 --> 38:48.825
(retching)

38:55.334 --> 38:57.934
Yeah, you can't beat me.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.504
You can't beat me.

39:01.506 --> 39:06.443
You... can't... beat... me.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.745
Jim: Come on, you bastard!

39:08.747 --> 39:11.781
(grunting)

39:12.851 --> 39:15.051
Sounds like
he's got it under control.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.086
(toilet flushing)

39:25.030 --> 39:28.031
Sir, I believe you were next.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.440
That was unbelievably foul.

39:37.442 --> 39:39.442
And somehow, almost sexy.

39:39.444 --> 39:42.445
Ooh, look like somebody's gonna
be playing janitor tonight.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.515
Well, if that's what
this place brings out of you,

39:45.517 --> 39:47.050
I think we should buy
three of them.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.885
I just want the one.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.420
Yeah, that was hyperbole, honey.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.821
Okay.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.023
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go, uh...

39:54.025 --> 39:56.092
bathe myself in bleach.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.494
Good idea.

39:58.697 --> 40:01.464
All right, you got your pen.
You got your pad.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.966
- And you know your menu.
- Yes.

40:02.968 --> 40:05.034
- You ready to go?
- Bring it.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.470
All right, I don't think
I've ever seen such potential.

40:07.472 --> 40:10.106
Hey, you give them hell,
Jimmy Boy.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.277
This one is for you.

40:13.278 --> 40:14.778
- (rock music playing) -Look,
you just give them a big smile

40:14.780 --> 40:16.660
and let them love you. Come on.

40:18.850 --> 40:19.883
We're rocking now.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.423
(chatter)

40:27.893 --> 40:29.426
I asked for a refill.

40:29.428 --> 40:31.561
Shoot! I'm so sorry.
I'm on it. I'm on it.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.523
Yeah, that's what
you said last time.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.166
I still need syrup.

40:36.168 --> 40:37.867
Okay, it's coming right up.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.103
Where's my straw?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.604
Straw, yes. You got it.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.473
- And my hot sauce.
- Hot sauce.

40:43.475 --> 40:44.874
Table 15 wants their check, man.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.075
Just give me a second,
all right?

40:46.077 --> 40:48.978
Yo, I said Webster.
This is a Wally.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.147
- Okay, let me see what I can do.
- Yeah, get me my Webster.

40:51.149 --> 40:54.951
Hey, scrambled up. Table seven.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.920
Sunny side up. Table five.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.557
Jim, can I help you
with anything?

41:00.558 --> 41:03.159
I need a refill on 12. 13 wants a straw.
Syrup for 14. Check on 15.

41:03.161 --> 41:06.129
Oh, and a... And a Webster
not a Wally on 12.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.931
Jim, you just got sat
on the patio.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.883
We have a patio?

41:09.884 --> 41:11.834
Okay, there was a... There was
a box of them right here.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.069
- Now, they're not here.
- Jim, baby.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.205
- I need straws.
- Jim! Jim, look at me.

41:15.207 --> 41:17.907
It's okay. You're in
what we call "the weeds."

41:17.909 --> 41:19.943
- I can't find the straws.
- I know. It's okay.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.878
Look, we're gonna
get your section under control,

41:21.880 --> 41:24.614
and then you're gonna take over the
regulars at the high bar, okay?

41:24.616 --> 41:26.149
Give you a chance
to take it easy for a bit.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.884
- Sound like a plan?
- Yeah.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.586
Okay. All right, follow me.
Look at me.

41:29.588 --> 41:30.753
Come on. It's okay.

41:33.058 --> 41:34.224
Excuse me.

41:34.226 --> 41:36.226
I need a refill please.

41:36.228 --> 41:38.228
I got you.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.229
Man, Kathy, you're getting
your $1.25's worth today.

41:40.232 --> 41:42.065
Like you're any better.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.867
Sitting around here waiting
till you get a phone call

41:43.869 --> 41:45.668
to go repo someone's car.

41:45.670 --> 41:48.238
- (whistles)
- And ruin their life.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.573
Yeah, been there,
done that today.

41:50.575 --> 41:51.875
Made her cry and throw up.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.010
That must have been really neat
to see firsthand.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.211
No, you misunderstand.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.080
It didn't happen
both at the same time.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.202
First, she cried,
and then she... (laughing)

42:00.285 --> 42:02.519
She puked all over her car.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.588
You're right. That does
make all the difference.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.123
Of course it does. Yeah.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.292
Well, man, I'm in it
for the money, but hey,

42:09.294 --> 42:12.562
it's the little perks
that make it so rewarding.

42:12.564 --> 42:14.231
Where's my food?

42:14.232 --> 42:15.899
Well, there's your Sprite.
Your bacon is on its way.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.200
In the meantime,
please enjoy your grits.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.002
This is unacceptable.

42:19.004 --> 42:21.804
I ain't putting my bacon
in cold grits.

42:21.806 --> 42:25.108
I am really sorry. I will bring you
out a fresh bowl with your bacon.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.944
I hope you know I ain't paying
for this Sprite either.

42:27.946 --> 42:30.179
You gotta be faster
if you wanna get paid.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.850
Ma'am, I desperately want
you to enjoy your meal,

42:33.852 --> 42:37.132
but I need to know. Do you want your
food brought out promptly or slowly?

42:37.989 --> 42:39.756
What kind of stupid question
is that?

42:39.758 --> 42:41.958
Well, I was too fast
with your grits,

42:41.960 --> 42:43.293
and then the Sprite
took too long,

42:43.295 --> 42:44.661
and you started bitching at me.

42:44.663 --> 42:46.480
(scoffs)

42:46.481 --> 42:48.298
- What did you call me?
- Uh-huh, waffle man.

42:48.300 --> 42:52.869
Jim: In 2008, financial institutions
cost Americans trillions of dollars

42:52.871 --> 42:55.405
with little more
than a slap on the wrist.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.940
Here, a tardy plate of bacon had
turned me into a Jackson Pollock.

42:57.943 --> 43:00.310
Whoa! Take it easy.
He's still new.

43:00.312 --> 43:03.246
Better watch his mouth, 'cause next
time, it's gonna be more than grits.

43:03.248 --> 43:04.781
Hey, Jimmy.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.049
Get over here.

43:09.354 --> 43:13.222
You do realize
this is a business...

43:13.224 --> 43:16.960
and that we are completely
dependent upon repeat clientele?

43:16.962 --> 43:19.896
Yes, I mishandled the situation.

43:19.898 --> 43:21.998
Sure, you did.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.001
But strangely,
that gives me some hope for you.

43:25.003 --> 43:28.371
But there ain't no point in you
telling someone to go to hell

43:28.373 --> 43:30.840
when they're already
on their way there.

43:30.842 --> 43:32.375
Now...

43:32.377 --> 43:34.811
this might take
some starch out of your collar,

43:35.747 --> 43:36.947
but you gotta make it right.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.086
Go on.

43:50.362 --> 43:51.628
Here you go.

43:51.630 --> 43:52.929
On me.

43:52.931 --> 43:54.697
It sure is.

43:56.334 --> 43:59.669
I apologize
for my poor choice of words.

43:59.671 --> 44:01.871
It was wrong
and not befitting of Papa's.

44:01.873 --> 44:03.373
You ain't getting no tip.

44:03.375 --> 44:05.208
Of course not.

44:05.210 --> 44:06.709
Enjoy your meal.

44:07.912 --> 44:10.046
Here you go, Jim.

44:10.048 --> 44:11.114
Keep the change.

44:11.116 --> 44:15.018
Jim: The repo man always left
me more than I deserved.

44:15.020 --> 44:18.021
He spent his days cleaning up
the messes made by financiers

44:18.023 --> 44:20.890
who made loans to people who had
no business receiving them.

44:20.892 --> 44:22.425
By cleaning up
after the repo man,

44:22.427 --> 44:24.894
I had completed the circle
of economic justice.

44:32.103 --> 44:34.270
Are you smoking pot, Jim?

44:34.272 --> 44:35.272
No.

44:36.241 --> 44:37.373
Maybe you should start.

44:39.077 --> 44:41.358
I want you to take that home.
Give it a once-through.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.347
"From Ex-Con to Babylon."

44:44.349 --> 44:48.451
It's our etiquette guide to
help felons who are having a...

44:48.453 --> 44:51.454
tough time re-acclimating
into normal society.

44:51.456 --> 44:52.855
Is this really necessary?

44:53.858 --> 44:55.291
There's some good stuff
in there.

44:55.293 --> 44:57.213
Read it a couple
of times myself.

44:58.263 --> 44:59.962
(sighs) Okay.

44:59.964 --> 45:01.798
A clean one on the house.

45:03.234 --> 45:04.300
Thanks.

45:06.004 --> 45:07.604
- (sighs)
- (beeps)

45:15.280 --> 45:19.015
Jimmy D, hey, there's still
a few customers in there.

45:19.017 --> 45:22.385
You sure you don't wanna try and
add an omelet to those grits?

45:22.387 --> 45:23.953
I'm not really
in the mood, Edward.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.755
Aw, come on now, man.

45:25.757 --> 45:26.757
Hold up.

45:27.492 --> 45:29.759
Hey, what do you do
for exercise?

45:29.761 --> 45:32.412
Exercise?

45:32.413 --> 45:35.064
Well, now, surely, you don't consider
driving this car of yours a workout.

45:35.066 --> 45:37.500
I, uh... I hit the gym.

45:37.502 --> 45:40.069
Well, that's all I wanted to hear.
You're coming with me.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.738
Hey, you mind driving?

45:41.740 --> 45:43.740
I'm still working
on getting me a car.

45:47.345 --> 45:50.279
Hey, hey, don't panic, Jimbo.

45:50.281 --> 45:52.782
I promise to get you home
in one piece.

45:55.019 --> 45:57.520
(grunting)

46:04.062 --> 46:06.129
Yeah. (Laughs)

46:06.131 --> 46:07.363
Hey, come on. Hit it.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.333
- Hit...
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:11.336 --> 46:14.036
Aw. Come on, man!

46:14.038 --> 46:16.372
It's the grits girl.
Give it to her.

46:16.374 --> 46:18.441
- Grits girl? Okay.
- Yeah, go ahead.

46:22.547 --> 46:23.479
Whoa. Whoa.

46:23.481 --> 46:26.082
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy. You all right?

46:26.084 --> 46:27.016
Yeah.

46:27.018 --> 46:28.317
- You sure?
- Yeah.

46:28.319 --> 46:33.990
(Edward grunting)

46:33.992 --> 46:36.559
(exhales) Yeah, baby.

46:38.029 --> 46:39.562
Hey, how's that eye, huh?

46:40.498 --> 46:42.131
Oh, it's fine.

46:42.133 --> 46:44.467
Oh, good. It takes time.

46:44.469 --> 46:47.309
You know, my dad started
me boxing when I was 10.

46:48.173 --> 46:49.505
He taught me to cook, too.

46:49.507 --> 46:53.075
About the only two things
he showed me worth repeating.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.814
I heard you're thinking
about buying the Papa's.

46:59.184 --> 47:01.050
You heard right.

47:01.052 --> 47:03.085
Don't take this
the wrong way, Jimmy,

47:03.087 --> 47:05.021
but beyond working the register,

47:05.023 --> 47:07.990
I wouldn't say you had much
aptitude toward the business.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.459
I'm only 121 hours in here,
Edward.

47:10.461 --> 47:13.496
I guess I'm trying to figure out why
you're putting yourself through it.

47:13.498 --> 47:16.465
Because it's tough,
and it's honest,

47:16.467 --> 47:19.468
and it's the furthest thing
from what I was doing.

47:19.470 --> 47:23.239
Let me tell you something. I've
been working there almost 10 years.

47:23.241 --> 47:26.042
Okay?

47:26.043 --> 47:29.243
I've heard a lot of people talk big
about getting their own Papa's.

47:30.048 --> 47:33.149
But never once
has any one of them done it.

47:37.355 --> 47:39.355
Let me have
another crack at that bag.

47:41.326 --> 47:43.860
(laughs) Go ahead.

47:43.862 --> 47:45.995
- It's a little bit heavier, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, it's heavier.

47:45.997 --> 47:46.996
Keep your head right here.

47:46.998 --> 47:49.599
Edward: Hey! (Laughs)

47:49.601 --> 47:51.500
My main man!

47:51.502 --> 47:53.402
- Dad!
- Hey!

47:53.404 --> 47:55.271
- That's your son?
- Yeah.

47:55.273 --> 47:56.422
He's so little.

47:56.423 --> 47:57.572
You know
they come that way, right?

47:57.575 --> 47:59.175
I guess
I'll find out soon enough.

47:59.177 --> 48:01.143
I didn't know
you were expecting.

48:01.145 --> 48:03.246
Well, we haven't exactly
gone wide with it yet.

48:03.248 --> 48:05.615
I tell you, it's not so easy,

48:05.617 --> 48:07.416
but it's worth it.

48:07.418 --> 48:08.951
Most of the time.

48:08.953 --> 48:10.319
All the time.

48:10.321 --> 48:12.388
(laughs) Yeah, all the time.

48:12.390 --> 48:14.957
"Great achievement is born
of great sacrifice."

48:14.959 --> 48:16.893
- Hmm.
- Napoleon Hill said that.

48:16.895 --> 48:18.494
Hmm. Sounds like a smart dude.

48:19.430 --> 48:21.898
- All right, man, thanks for the ride.
- All right.

48:21.900 --> 48:25.067
Hey, I will see you
on the front line.

48:25.069 --> 48:26.903
Come on, baby. Come on.

48:33.678 --> 48:37.113
Jim: Up until this point, my whole
life had been one of accumulation.

48:37.115 --> 48:40.983
I had always thought of this car as a symbol
for who I was and who I wanted to be,

48:40.985 --> 48:43.419
and now, that's exactly
why I was going to sell it.

48:43.421 --> 48:46.289
If I truly wanted this restaurant,
I had to put skin in the game,

48:46.291 --> 48:47.590
a lot of skin.

48:47.592 --> 48:48.991
Maybe even a leg.

48:51.496 --> 48:52.628
- Becky: Hey.
- Hey.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.363
Whose car is that?

48:54.365 --> 48:55.398
Mine.

48:55.400 --> 48:57.240
- Where's your car?
- I sold it.

48:58.069 --> 48:59.402
Is that a black eye?

48:59.404 --> 49:00.937
Edward took me boxing.

49:00.939 --> 49:01.938
Did he hit you?

49:01.940 --> 49:03.372
No, not exactly.

49:03.374 --> 49:06.042
It's hard to explain.
It's called a double-end bag.

49:06.044 --> 49:07.627
Yeah, I know what that is.

49:07.628 --> 49:09.211
It was this freak accident
equipment failure thing.

49:09.213 --> 49:11.981
The bag came back
and, uh... struck me.

49:13.184 --> 49:14.250
So you hit yourself?

49:14.252 --> 49:19.288
The point being I realized that if we
really want to purchase this restaurant,

49:19.290 --> 49:21.691
we're gonna have
to make some sacrifices.

49:21.693 --> 49:24.460
I mean, a full lifestyle change.

49:24.462 --> 49:27.330
Well, as long as it doesn't include
you becoming a professional boxer,

49:27.332 --> 49:28.564
I think we'll be fine.

49:28.566 --> 49:30.733
Becky, I'm talking
about the house.

49:32.971 --> 49:34.571
- The house?
- Yeah.

49:35.740 --> 49:36.672
No.

49:36.674 --> 49:41.444
No, no, no, no. We're not selling
the house. Are you crazy?

49:41.446 --> 49:43.713
- You've been there what? Three weeks?
- Just... hear me out.

49:43.715 --> 49:46.248
I talked to Mr. Drake,
and he helped me realize

49:46.250 --> 49:48.117
it was the only way we're ever
gonna accrue enough equity.

49:48.119 --> 49:50.252
Well, that's good that Mr. Drake is
on board with selling the house.

49:50.254 --> 49:52.374
Did you ask him
if we should sell my car too?

49:53.458 --> 49:54.991
Jim!

49:54.993 --> 49:57.326
I love this house.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.594
You love this house.

49:58.596 --> 50:00.947
I know. I do.

50:00.948 --> 50:03.299
But there is no guarantee the restaurant
will be profitable right away.

50:03.301 --> 50:05.067
This mortgage is
already outpacing us.

50:05.069 --> 50:07.109
We can't have it
hanging over our heads.

50:08.139 --> 50:09.605
(sighs)

50:09.607 --> 50:12.441
I thought we were gonna
raise our family in this house.

50:13.378 --> 50:15.328
I know it's a lot to ask,

50:15.329 --> 50:17.279
and if I could make the numbers
come out any other way, I would.

50:17.281 --> 50:18.281
Believe me. I...

50:19.484 --> 50:20.516
I just...

50:22.320 --> 50:24.186
I just need to get out. I need
to go for a drive or something.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.388
Becky. Becky.

50:25.390 --> 50:27.156
I need some time.

50:47.078 --> 50:49.745
Jim: It took four nights on the couch
and a trip to the chiropractor

50:49.747 --> 50:51.580
before she acknowledged
my existence.

50:51.582 --> 50:54.350
All things considered,
I got off easy.

51:01.092 --> 51:04.172
Can I start you off with some
coffee, orange juice, or hot tea?

51:04.495 --> 51:07.455
You can start by slowing it down.
We just got the menus.

51:18.342 --> 51:19.275
(beeps)

51:19.277 --> 51:21.377
(alarm beeping)

51:27.318 --> 51:30.152
We've got a buyer.
We've got a sale!

51:30.154 --> 51:32.321
Winnie and a Wheeler coming up.

51:32.323 --> 51:33.689
Okay.

51:33.691 --> 51:36.492
- You doing all right?
- Got it under control.

51:38.429 --> 51:39.429
(plates breaking)

51:42.266 --> 51:44.266
Need another Wheeler on the fly.

51:45.570 --> 51:47.269
(beeps)

51:48.406 --> 51:53.209
(alarm beeping)

52:14.332 --> 52:15.431
Put your hands on the Bible now.

52:15.433 --> 52:21.504
Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you Billy and Mary Crohns!

52:21.506 --> 52:23.305
Kiss the bride!

52:23.307 --> 52:24.573
(cheering)

52:24.575 --> 52:26.442
(exclaims) I quit!

52:44.228 --> 52:46.529
Jim, how much is the Wanda?

52:47.899 --> 52:49.732
$9.72 with tax.

52:53.671 --> 52:55.738
Could I borrow $5?

52:55.740 --> 52:57.239
How much you got?

52:57.241 --> 52:58.241
Um...

53:00.311 --> 53:01.911
$4.85.

53:01.913 --> 53:03.846
Well, $5 would get you there.

53:03.848 --> 53:04.880
Yeah.

53:09.787 --> 53:11.867
All right, when do you wanna
pay me back?

53:15.193 --> 53:16.559
How about next week?

53:20.798 --> 53:21.931
Deal.

53:23.234 --> 53:24.833
Thank you, Jim.

53:24.835 --> 53:26.702
You have my word.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.337
I know where you eat.

53:34.979 --> 53:36.512
Wanda.

53:36.514 --> 53:37.813
Hey, Jimmy, man.

53:37.815 --> 53:40.716
Did you just lend Kathy money?

53:40.718 --> 53:41.784
$5, yeah.

53:43.754 --> 53:44.820
You can kiss that goodbye.

53:44.822 --> 53:47.256
Said she'd pay me back.

53:47.258 --> 53:50.359
She owes a couple bucks
to everybody in this place.

53:50.361 --> 53:52.695
You know she's
a little whacked out, right?

53:52.697 --> 53:54.763
She's eccentric, sure.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.571
She gets electroshock
every week.

54:02.573 --> 54:05.908
She's been riding that lightning
for the past 18 years.

54:07.545 --> 54:09.578
That explains
the earmuffs in July.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.580
Yeah.

54:11.582 --> 54:14.917
Well, if that's the way you've been
investing people's money all these years,

54:14.919 --> 54:17.820
maybe you are better off
at Papa's.

54:23.427 --> 54:24.560
Who's Boss Hogg?

54:25.496 --> 54:27.363
A franchisee out of Austin.

54:27.365 --> 54:29.331
Checking out the restaurant.

54:29.333 --> 54:30.699
This restaurant?

54:30.701 --> 54:32.718
You're kidding.

54:32.719 --> 54:34.736
No, I believe he's real serious.

54:37.408 --> 54:38.574
Well, it was a pleasure,
Big Jake.

54:38.576 --> 54:39.942
It's good talking to you too,
Matthew.

54:39.944 --> 54:41.624
- All right.
- Thank you.

54:41.946 --> 54:43.746
Uh, excuse me.

54:43.748 --> 54:45.514
I couldn't help but overhear.

54:45.516 --> 54:47.016
You're thinking
about buying the place.

54:47.018 --> 54:50.286
This'll be my third. I already
got two back in Texas.

54:50.288 --> 54:52.021
Wouldn't mind going national.

54:52.023 --> 54:53.489
I love that bravery.

54:53.491 --> 54:54.990
I hope you have a good tax man.

54:54.992 --> 54:56.642
Compared to Texas,

54:56.643 --> 54:58.293
this state is about as
hospitable as communist Russia.

54:58.296 --> 55:00.062
(laughing) Why, sure,

55:00.064 --> 55:01.864
I got a tax guy.

55:01.866 --> 55:04.433
In a former life,
I was VP at Alpha Managers.

55:04.435 --> 55:06.435
No doubt you're familiar
with our Texas branch.

55:06.437 --> 55:08.604
I think we were number three
in the area.

55:08.606 --> 55:09.606
I'm Jim Adams.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.841
Jacob Masterson.
Call me Big Jake.

55:12.843 --> 55:16.312
All right, well, tax codes can be a
bit tricky around here, Big Jake.

55:16.314 --> 55:18.614
See, once a business hits
a 250K threshold,

55:18.616 --> 55:21.483
municipality and state taxes
can run up to 15%.

55:21.485 --> 55:23.952
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, not a lot of people do.

55:23.954 --> 55:26.922
The trick is to aggressively depreciate
fixed assets on your tax return.

55:26.924 --> 55:28.424
But if you don't know
what you're doing,

55:28.426 --> 55:30.426
you can get mired
in a nasty audit very quickly.

55:30.428 --> 55:32.995
- Oh, audits! I had the feds.
- Tell me about it.

55:32.997 --> 55:35.964
But hey, you got a guy inside the
State Attorney General's Office,

55:35.966 --> 55:37.800
I'm sure
you'll probably be fine.

55:37.802 --> 55:39.601
Good, old Uncle Sam, huh?

55:39.603 --> 55:41.637
Once he starts nibbling,
he just can't help himself.

55:41.639 --> 55:43.839
He wants the whole damn thing,
every time.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.391
You know what I'm talking about.

55:45.392 --> 55:46.942
All right, well,
I gotta get back on the floor.

55:46.944 --> 55:48.911
Best of luck with all this.
Sincerely.

55:48.913 --> 55:50.546
Hey, appreciate
the insight, Jim.

55:50.548 --> 55:51.547
- Thank you.
- You got it.

55:51.549 --> 55:56.085
He flew out of there as if just being in
the state was gonna trigger an audit.

55:56.087 --> 55:58.020
It worked perfectly.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.954
It's gonna take you another two
months to reach your hours.

55:59.957 --> 56:00.989
Did you call Drake?

56:00.991 --> 56:02.391
Directly afterward.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.460
He said Big Jake happened to be
in the area,

56:04.462 --> 56:07.542
and heard about the restaurants being up
for sale, and decided to have a look.

56:07.765 --> 56:09.131
Well, did he sound sincere?

56:09.133 --> 56:10.966
He assured me that we're
at the top of his list,

56:10.968 --> 56:13.435
and everyone else at this
point is just a looky-loo.

56:13.437 --> 56:14.903
He said "looky-loo"?

56:14.905 --> 56:16.538
It's not a term I'd use.

56:16.540 --> 56:17.973
Okay, well,
we need to speed this up.

56:17.975 --> 56:19.895
I mean,
we sold our house for this.

56:20.644 --> 56:22.511
Couldn't agree more.

56:22.513 --> 56:24.813
Tomorrow,
I'm dropping the hammer.

56:27.084 --> 56:28.951
Have you seen Matthew?

56:28.953 --> 56:30.652
- Freezer.
- Thanks.

56:34.392 --> 56:36.509
Is that a 401K?

56:36.510 --> 56:38.627
Mm-hmm. My husband is thinking
about cashing it in.

56:38.629 --> 56:40.396
It's a little early for that,
isn't it?

56:40.398 --> 56:41.897
You'd take a big tax hit.

56:41.899 --> 56:43.065
Yeah, we don't have a choice.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.733
Trying to get our daughter
to college.

56:44.735 --> 56:45.968
You mind if I...

56:45.970 --> 56:47.870
Oh, yeah, please do.

56:51.108 --> 56:52.808
Tell your husband
to max out his contribution.

56:52.810 --> 56:54.627
They'll match him
dollar for dollar.

56:54.628 --> 56:56.445
Wait. They'll do that?
Nobody ever mentioned that.

56:56.447 --> 56:58.480
They never do.
You have to know to ask.

56:58.482 --> 57:00.466
And I would take out
education loans

57:00.467 --> 57:02.451
that don't accrue interest until your
daughter is finished with her schooling,

57:02.453 --> 57:04.720
which should give you four years,
six if she goes for her master's,

57:04.722 --> 57:07.022
to build up
a nice, little nest egg.

57:07.024 --> 57:08.904
- Thanks, Jim.
- Yeah, no problem.

57:10.161 --> 57:11.760
Hey, Matthew, you got a minute?

57:12.963 --> 57:14.496
Yeah, just doing
a little inventory.

57:14.498 --> 57:17.132
- I can come back.
- No, come on.

57:17.134 --> 57:19.134
Well, I was thinking
about that 1,000 hours,

57:19.136 --> 57:21.670
and how it's taking me a significant
amount of time to complete.

57:21.672 --> 57:23.472
Yeah, how can I help.

57:23.474 --> 57:25.607
I need more hours.

57:25.609 --> 57:27.976
Eye of the tiger. I like it.

57:27.978 --> 57:28.911
How many we talking?

57:28.913 --> 57:30.179
Doubles.

57:30.181 --> 57:34.483
Oh, you think you can handle
16 hours a day in this place?

57:34.485 --> 57:36.518
I used to do it all the
time at my old job.

57:36.520 --> 57:37.520
(Matthew sighs)

57:38.489 --> 57:39.955
All I got is third shift.

57:39.957 --> 57:41.857
Great. I'll take it.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.561
- Third shift?
- Yeah.

57:45.563 --> 57:46.563
Hell itself?

57:47.798 --> 57:51.934
Well, if it gets me to 1,000
hours quicker, I, uh...

57:51.936 --> 57:53.969
I don't care what it is.
I'll do it.

57:55.473 --> 57:57.206
You got balls
the size of cantaloupe, Jim.

57:57.208 --> 57:58.208
I'll give you that.

58:00.478 --> 58:02.010
Jim: Waffle fact.

58:02.012 --> 58:04.480
Third shift takes place
from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.,

58:04.482 --> 58:06.215
and as I quickly learned,

58:06.216 --> 58:07.949
has nothing to do with serving
patrons and earning tips.

58:07.952 --> 58:10.336
It's a battleground,

58:10.337 --> 58:12.721
a nightly reenactment of 250 Texans
defending an old Spanish mission

58:12.723 --> 58:15.057
against the Mexican army
10 times their strength.

58:15.059 --> 58:16.558
The bars let out at 2:00 a.m.,

58:16.560 --> 58:18.193
and by 2:30,
we are completely besieged

58:18.195 --> 58:21.797
by the drunk, the loud,
and the clinically insane.

58:21.799 --> 58:23.098
Uh, just...

58:24.768 --> 58:26.235
Man: Be honest with me, baby.

58:26.237 --> 58:28.637
Do I have great tits...

58:28.639 --> 58:30.606
(indistinct)

58:31.942 --> 58:33.742
Sure, she had a tight body,

58:33.744 --> 58:35.744
but the girl is missing
too many teeth.

58:36.847 --> 58:37.880
Oh, no.

58:39.850 --> 58:41.583
I like chicken curry.

58:41.585 --> 58:44.620
You can't handle this.
You can't handle this.

58:47.725 --> 58:49.805
- What up, kid?
- Hang on one second, okay.

58:50.294 --> 58:51.927
- Hey.
- Yeah.

58:51.929 --> 58:53.809
- He just got here.
- Okay, great.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.966
(slurring, mumbling)

58:57.968 --> 58:59.902
He wants to know
if he can order.

58:59.904 --> 59:00.944
I don't know. Can he?

59:13.150 --> 59:15.150
People here are talking
about you, man.

59:15.886 --> 59:18.006
Say you used to work
at a bank or something.

59:18.923 --> 59:20.289
People have their facts wrong.

59:22.259 --> 59:24.126
What did you do?

59:24.128 --> 59:25.627
I used to blow up banks.

59:26.564 --> 59:27.896
No kidding?

59:27.898 --> 59:30.566
I had a cousin
who used to rob banks.

59:30.568 --> 59:33.268
I didn't say I robbed them.
I blew them up.

59:33.270 --> 59:35.904
My buddies and I convinced the
bank officers to give us the money

59:35.906 --> 59:38.674
which we used
to buy bad mortgage bonds.

59:38.676 --> 59:40.796
And that's what it means
to blow up a bank.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.847
That's tough, man.

59:48.953 --> 59:50.285
Stick it.

59:51.855 --> 59:53.021
Thank you.

59:55.726 --> 59:57.993
Didn't know
you were in the club.

59:57.995 --> 59:59.094
What club?

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.929
You, me, and Edward, man,

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.264
we all did time.

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:03.632
Edward?

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:06.368
Yeah, man, 27 years.

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:07.370
For what?

01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:10.973
I don't know.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:13.875
He won't say.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.211
Manuel.

01:00:17.348 --> 01:00:19.948
I never did any time.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.050
(chuckling) One bad ass mofo.

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.619
Blowing up banks.

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:25.871
Hey, Larry,
drop me two scatter, please.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:29.152
I can't hear you. Are you standing on
the bird? 'Cause I can't hear you.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:50.212
Hey, Jimmy Jambalaya.

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:51.747
How's that double treating you?

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:54.282
Nine hours down, eight to go.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:57.364
Yeah, I'm surprised you made it
through third shift without me.

01:00:57.788 --> 01:01:00.539
It wasn't easy, but I managed.

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:04.020
Well, I doubt if it lasts. I don't see you
going too far without my hand-holding.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:08.342
What do you think about me taking
a little spin on that grill?

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:10.999
My grill?

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.201
With your supervision,
of course.

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:14.203
Hmm.

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:17.139
What do you have in mind?

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:20.976
I always wanted
to make an omelet.

01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:22.678
An omelet.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.680
Huh.

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:27.049
Why don't we start you out
with hash browns?

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:31.853
There's only so much damage
you can do with a grated potato.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:32.855
Come on.

01:01:35.325 --> 01:01:37.092
All right, there. Now...

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:40.228
add your cheese
and whatever else you want.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.464
But your focus
is on the hash brown.

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:45.033
Keep it crispy. Keep it golden.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.370
Total is $489.60.

01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:54.409
I'm sorry. That didn't take.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:55.977
Hmm.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:58.214
Oh!

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:00.182
You okay?

01:02:01.118 --> 01:02:03.185
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

01:02:03.187 --> 01:02:05.187
I just, uh...
Let's just try this one.

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:08.223
(exhales) (winces)

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:11.960
Oh! (Stammers)

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:14.802
Do you need me to call an
ambulance or something?

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:18.333
No. No, no, no.
I'm okay. Thank you.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:23.839
(winces)

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:33.849
I think I'm ready for an omelet.

01:02:33.851 --> 01:02:35.984
No, not today. Maybe tomorrow.

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:39.121
- Yeah, that looks...
- He says I'm not ready for an omelet.

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:40.822
(tires screeching)

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:45.327
Baby, what are you doing here?

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:47.896
- I already had a lawyer draft them up.
- Babe.

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:49.264
Are you out of your mind?
I'm at work.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.432
Oh, yeah? You wanna be here?

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:51.967
Then you can be here without me.

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.936
I'm not living
like this anymore.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.904
- I'm trying to put a roof over our head.
- I can't stand being near you.

01:02:55.906 --> 01:02:58.774
I can't stand looking at you.

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:00.208
It's embarrassing.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.130
- Nancy, listen...
- You're pathetic.

01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:04.546
- Hey.
- Don't follow me!

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:07.015
- Hey, Nancy.
- Stay away from me!

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.483
Don't follow me!

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:09.551
What did I do wrong?

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:11.119
(arguing continues)

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:27.035
Come on. You can't leave in the
middle of a shift like that.

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:29.271
It's not professional.

01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:31.139
He'll be back.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.943
Jim: That was the last time any
of us ever saw Matthew Linslow.

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:36.845
I can't imagine
anything more depressing

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.513
than being dumped
by your wife of six years

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:40.916
in the parking lot
of a Papa's Chicken and Waffle.

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:42.150
Oh, crap!

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.542
Well, first off, I wanna say
that the baby is fine.

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:57.465
But what we can see is that the
placenta is partially detached,

01:03:57.467 --> 01:04:00.936
which is why you're experiencing
the discomfort and heavy spotting.

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:04.072
So the most important thing now
is to get lots of rest,

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:07.075
which means no work,
no exercise,

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:09.044
and avoid
any stressful situations.

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:16.852
Well, there goes my job.

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:19.554
Hey. I'm working on it.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:22.290
Jim, I need you
to be there for me.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.259
I need you to answer
when I call.

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:28.295
You're working more than
you ever did at Alpha.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:31.499
I'm sorry, Beck.

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.268
Forget the store.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:36.137
What about us?

01:04:37.241 --> 01:04:39.908
Is this how it's gonna be
when you own the place?

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:40.910
No.

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:43.111
No, it's not. I promise.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:46.275
Jim.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.657
What are you doing
eating at the high bar?

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:54.115
You're never supposed to eat on
the restaurant floor in uniform.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:56.518
It looks unprofessional
to the customers.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.971
You're absolutely right, Larry,

01:05:58.972 --> 01:06:02.212
and the minute I see a customer, I'll
be sure to abide by that policy.

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:05.961
Don't disrespect me.

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:07.495
I'm the manager now.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.297
I will write you up.

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:14.336
Jim: Much to our dismay,

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.337
Larry Coble had both server
and grill experience,

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.607
which made him the only
candidate eligible for the job.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:22.077
Edward joined Jacqui
as an assistant manager,

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:24.396
and in a surprise twist,

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:26.714
four-time rehire, Mrs. Mary Crohns,
was promoted to shift manager

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:28.984
based entirely
on her accumulated hours.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.587
First off, let's welcome
Mary back to the team.

01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:34.556
- (applause)
- Thanks, y'all.

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:36.591
Now, let's get down to business.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:41.296
As we all know, Matthew was more
interested in making friends

01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:42.664
than he was
in running a restaurant.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:46.368
Well... I don't need
any new friends.

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:50.538
What I need
is written on these sheets.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:53.141
Let's go through them together,
okay?

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:56.211
Jim, why don't you read
the first one for us?

01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:01.082
"Servers will not eat anywhere
other than the break room."

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.085
Let's hope that one sinks in.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:05.420
Hmm?

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:07.088
Jim: It pains me to admit it,

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.174
but I couldn't wait
to buy the place

01:07:09.175 --> 01:07:11.259
just so I could see the look on
Larry's face when I fired him.

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:14.195
Just let me know
if you need anything else, okay?

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.597
You guys just
have a seat wherever.

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:16.679
I'll be right with you.

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.367
All right.

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:22.137
- A coffee here.
- Thank you.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:23.405
A coffee here.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.574
Working on your MBAs?

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:31.479
Uh, yeah,
we have a big exam tomorrow.

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:34.482
Look at that, profitability ratios.
That's my specialty.

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:36.217
Need any help?

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:38.820
Thanks,
but it's pretty complicated.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:40.722
Aw, I wouldn't say that.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.457
I used to be
in the business myself.

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:44.225
Good for you.

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.127
I worked at Alpha Managers.

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:49.497
- What?
- You worked at Alpha?

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:51.883
Well, not really important.

01:07:51.884 --> 01:07:54.268
Let's get you two a healthy meal, huh?
Big test coming up and all.

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:56.438
Can I interest you
in some chocolate chip waffles?

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.207
-No, the coffee is fine.

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.175
No problem.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.176
Wait.

01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:02.710
What happened?

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:04.646
What happened with what?

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:06.481
Come on, man.

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:07.549
With Alpha.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:09.284
Yeah, why are you working here?

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.155
I know, right?

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:17.225
It... makes you wonder. I, uh...

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:19.661
I grew up in the suburbs.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.196
I went to a prep school.

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:22.831
I became
a debt trafficking financier.

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.566
I would just hate to see
what would happen

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:27.407
if I grew up on the wrong
side of town, you know?

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:30.505
See this?

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.466
Best thing that
ever happened to me.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:34.809
Good luck on those exams.

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:39.814
Posse?

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:42.250

Yeah. Yeah, my break is over.
Just got a little power nap.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:06.808
Uh-huh.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.778

Looks like you've been rode
hard and put away wet.

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:22.557
Well,
after 350 hours this month,

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:24.325
that's actually better
than I feel.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:27.395
You're on a red-hot burn
to the finish line.

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.596
Hey, boss man at six o'clock.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.867
- What do you mean you're tired?
- Go to work!

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.335
- Give me my jacket.
- Get out of here!

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.216
- What are you...
- Get out of here!

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:42.777
That is one extremely hard
woman, I'll tell you.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:43.944
She do that often?

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:46.948
Yeah. I seen his kids
slap on him too.

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:53.535
Is there some reason
you're not wearing your apron?

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.424
Oh. Uh, no.

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:59.666
I should always be in uniform when
I'm on the floor. Sorry about that.

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:02.764
(door opening)

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:06.401
This is your seventh location.

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:08.803
- The parking lot has 55 spaces.
- (speaking foreign language)

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:09.904
Welcome to Papa's. How many?

01:10:09.906 --> 01:10:12.207
Oh, we're not eating. Thank you.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:16.511
- Gross income was $967,000 last year.
- (speaking foreign language)

01:10:16.513 --> 01:10:19.547
Hi. Welcome. Welcome.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:20.982
Hope you're enjoying America.

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:22.750
Excuse me. Who are you?

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:24.652
I'm Larry Coble, the manager.

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:26.287
Okay, great.

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:28.590
Just not so close
to the clients. Thank you.

01:10:28.592 --> 01:10:30.358
Right, okay. Sorry.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.794
So, should I show
everyone around or...

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:34.362
I know the floor plan.
Thank you.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:36.147
This way, please.

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:38.429
- The beverage center...
- (speaking foreign language)

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:40.501
Who is that?

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:41.736
The new owners.

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.638
What?

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.800
Move out of the way.
Get back to your tables.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.477
The building has
a maximum capacity of...

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:50.645
Does Drake know about this?

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:53.381
Who do you think
sold it to them, jackass?

01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:55.583
It has received
an A health rating...

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:09.464
Receptionist: Sorry, Mr. Drake.

01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:11.366
It's all right, Ellie.

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:12.667
Hello, Jim.

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:14.629
I can't say
I'm surprised to see you.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.877
You can't tell me those new
owners have logged 1,000 hours.

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.979
Okay, they can't even
speak English.

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:26.848
And that 1,000 hours
is a prerequisite.

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.084
I read it
in the Rise and Shine manual.

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:31.319
I know what it says in the manual.
I helped write the damn thing.

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:32.654
And why do you think
it says that?

01:11:32.656 --> 01:11:34.355
Quality control.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:36.691
Surely, you can't be that naive.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:39.594
Those criteria are about
eliminating the competition,

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:41.062
not about bolstering the ranks.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:45.500
If it was that easy, there'd
be a Papa's every three feet.

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:48.303
Do you think
I actually put in 1,000 hours?

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:49.604
I believed everything you said.

01:11:49.606 --> 01:11:51.706
You let me sell my house.

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:55.843
And you never intended for me to acquire
the restaurant in the first place.

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:58.079
That is not true.

01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.648
In you, I saw
an ambitious young man

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.850
who wanted to buy
one of my stores,

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:04.819
and if it would have worked out,
I would have sold it to you.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.754
You mean
if I was the only buyer.

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:09.757
You know, modest as it may seem,

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:13.027
I consider these restaurants
my legacy.

01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:16.531
These people own several
successful chains worldwide.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:19.667
They're buying all 10.
It's an 8-figure deal for me.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:20.735
(sighs)

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:22.905
(scoffs)

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:26.641
I misjudged you.

01:12:28.378 --> 01:12:29.577
How's that?

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:33.948
I was under the impression
you were a man of integrity.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.922
My mother and father were both
passionate business people.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:43.858
They had me late in life.

01:12:45.095 --> 01:12:46.861
Pop had his tire store.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.863
Mom had her beauty parlor.

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:55.436
They worked their entire lives in
those stores, long, arduous hours.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:57.672
And what did it get them?
Nothing.

01:12:57.674 --> 01:13:00.675
They both died
broken down and mediocre.

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:03.611
I'm not doing that,

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.446
and this deal guarantees it.

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:07.982
You'd still be rich without it.

01:13:09.519 --> 01:13:10.985
I'd rather be richer.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.655
Yeah, of course you would.

01:13:15.592 --> 01:13:17.859
Don't be a child.
You're a businessman.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:19.994
It's simple numbers.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.898
It doesn't have
anything to do with numbers.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:47.088
Jim: Waffle fact.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:50.625
Miles Drake III was
completely full of shit.

01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:00.768
(screaming)

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.480
(door opens)

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:13.215
Hey, babe.

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:24.192
Rough day?

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:41.542
It's all right.

01:14:41.544 --> 01:14:43.678
Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out.

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:57.492
Hey, where's Edward?

01:14:57.494 --> 01:14:58.259
Transferred.

01:14:58.261 --> 01:14:59.894
Where?

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:02.029
Airport location. Got promoted.

01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:03.865
He's a manager now.

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:05.787
- When did this happen?
- Yesterday.

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:08.269
Jim, I sat you on nine.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.142
Great. Just what I needed.

01:15:19.816 --> 01:15:22.884
- Jimmy.
- Dad. Grandpop.

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.722
- Have a seat, Jim.
- I'm on the clock.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:31.158
Sit down.

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:38.766
I'm not gonna say a thing. I'm
just here for the bad coffee.

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:41.102
We talked to Becky.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:43.991
She said
you lost the restaurant.

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:46.040
We did.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:47.975
Well, now what's the plan?

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:51.178
I'm gonna finish my 1,000 hours.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.214
They can't take that
away from me.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.249
You've worked really hard here, son.
I'm really proud of you.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:16:00.588
We're not gonna let some two-faced
penny pincher steal this from you.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:04.125
We're gonna loan you
the money for the restaurant.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:07.094
You can open it wherever you want,
across the street if you want.

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:09.630
Drive this dive into the ground.

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:12.733
There's one condition,
and it is non-negotiable.

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:16.637
You have to take some time.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.140
For you and for your family.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.577
I can't take your money.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.947
You're not taking our money.
It's a loan.

01:16:25.949 --> 01:16:27.615
You bet your ass.

01:16:27.617 --> 01:16:29.697
And we're first dollar out
with interest.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.289
Look, it's not that I don't want
it, or I'm not appreciative,

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:37.959
because I do, and I am.

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:44.031
I didn't just get laid off from
Alpha Managers. I got fired.

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:49.136
I got fired because I purposely loaded
a mortgage fund with junk bonds

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:50.738
to boost its interest rate.

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:55.109
It's not illegal,
but it's not right,

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.377
and I knew that.

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:00.615
Well, what makes you think
we're so perfect?

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:03.718
You feel bad about it?

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.885
Terrible.

01:17:04.887 --> 01:17:06.821
You gonna do it again?

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:08.055
(sighs) Never.

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:10.657
- Well, then, get your head out...
- Dad.

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.260
I think we'd better get busy. You've
got a whole new life to create.

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:16.864
Time to get started.

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:25.272
- Just one today, sir?
- I'm looking for Edward.

01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:26.674
Over here, Jimmy!

01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:27.676
Thank you.

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:32.079
What are you doing on the grill?

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:35.049
I was looking forward to seeing you in
a polo, throwing your weight around.

01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:38.119
(chuckles)
Hey, that lasted about a week.

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:41.222
I couldn't stand it.

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:44.324
I figured I'd let somebody who likes all that
stiff shirts and paperwork have the job.

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:47.094
You know,
the grill man has gotta grill.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:49.830
Yeah.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:53.768
I'm about ready to take lunch.
You want anything?

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:55.136
I'm not really hungry.

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:57.138
Yeah, me neither.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.040
How about getting a Blendie?

01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:00.374
Yeah.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:01.456
Let's get out of here.

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:10.084
- That is good.
- Better than I thought.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:14.088
I'm opening my own Papa's.

01:18:15.892 --> 01:18:17.391
I'll be damned.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.193
I want you to work for me.

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:22.597
I would love for you
to be in management,

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:25.066
but if you're... hell-bent on grilling,
then I'll take what I can get.

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:26.300
Huh.

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:28.869
I...

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:33.107
You know, you...
you gotta know a man...

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:36.744
that's gonna work
for you, Jimmy.

01:18:36.746 --> 01:18:38.426
- I know you.
- Oh, no.

01:18:39.449 --> 01:18:42.116
That's not like
I'm talking about.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.319
You know me now.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:47.321
- You don't have to go into...
- No, no.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:51.225
I know what I need to say, so
keep quiet and let me tell it.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:54.963
(exhales)

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:57.364
When I was 17...

01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:02.369
me and a couple other boys
got a bad idea...

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:06.373
and we took that bad idea
to a liquor store.

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:10.044
Now, I didn't mean
for anyone to get hurt...

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:16.283
but I was certainly out to acquire
something that wasn't mine.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.753
Just by being there...

01:19:20.957 --> 01:19:23.157
I got tried and convicted
as an adult.

01:19:24.127 --> 01:19:28.796
And I spent 27 years
in a federal penitentiary.

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:31.298
Now, that's the man
you're sitting next to.

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:33.901
Now, I...

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:37.505
I've had plenty of time
to think about it, and...

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:41.342
If you really want something...

01:19:43.045 --> 01:19:45.012
you gotta work for it.

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:49.049
You know, greed doesn't...
take you anywhere good.

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:54.989
I still want you
to work with me.

01:19:58.261 --> 01:20:00.327
Let me ask you something, Jimmy.

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:06.167
Do you love
the restaurant business?

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.870
I see a life in it.

01:20:09.872 --> 01:20:11.752
No, that's not what I asked you.

01:20:13.376 --> 01:20:14.508
Do you love it?

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:18.879
I mean, be honest with yourself.

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:22.983
No.

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:28.589
No, I really don't.

01:20:30.927 --> 01:20:32.326
- You know, I love grilling.
- Sure.

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:36.330
I'd grill for free.
That's how much I love it.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:40.334
What do you love so much
that you would do it for free?

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:43.037
Because I know
it's not slinging hash browns

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:45.072
or unplugging toilets.

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:50.277
I'm gonna tell you.
You still need a grill man...

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.113
just let me know.

01:20:53.115 --> 01:20:54.635
- Hmm?
- I will.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:57.301
Yeah.

01:20:57.302 --> 01:20:59.462
Look, it's time for me
to roll up out of here.

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:02.256
I think we should toast.

01:21:02.258 --> 01:21:04.124
Although, I'm not sure to what.

01:21:06.062 --> 01:21:08.095
I can feel that.

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:09.263
How about to...

01:21:10.233 --> 01:21:11.866
you getting fired?

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.436
All right, I'm curious
to see where this goes.

01:21:15.438 --> 01:21:18.539
What are the chances

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.641
that you would have spent any time
at Papa's if it wasn't for that?

01:21:21.644 --> 01:21:23.978
- Slim.
- How about none?

01:21:26.249 --> 01:21:27.289
I'll see you, Edward.

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.217
See you around, Jimmy Mack.

01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:34.955
Hey, you didn't call me
Jimmy Dean or Jimmy Jam.

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:38.259
No, you've been the mack
for some time now.

01:21:40.029 --> 01:21:41.962
Take care of yourself

01:21:41.964 --> 01:21:43.364
and beware.

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.037
What can I get you, Kathy?

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:55.242
I need to apologize up front.

01:21:56.178 --> 01:22:00.547
My head has been...
a little out of sorts lately.

01:22:01.517 --> 01:22:03.250
I've had days like that myself.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:06.687
It's been worse
the past couple of days.

01:22:06.689 --> 01:22:09.223
I've been doing
a lot of sleepwalking.

01:22:09.225 --> 01:22:11.225
Millions of people
have that problem.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:15.195
I found a pair of jeans
in my commode this morning.

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:17.598
Slightly concerning.

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:19.935
(exclaims)

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:28.709
I know it's your last day.

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:30.644
Thank you, Kathy. This is...

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:38.585
(laughs)

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:41.666
You didn't think you were gonna
get your money back, did you?

01:22:42.358 --> 01:22:44.478
You know, the thought
never crossed my mind.

01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:50.531
Jim: This lesson that started
with a $200-million hustle

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:52.453
had ended
with a genuine $5 return.

01:22:56.706 --> 01:22:59.206
And although I decided against
buying my own restaurant,

01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:02.276
I found myself overcome with a
profound sense of gratitude.

01:23:03.245 --> 01:23:04.678
Thanks to the 1,000 hours
at Papa's,

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.247
I learned more about the
true nature of productivity,

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:09.316
economic organization,
and hard work

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:13.053
than from all my time in business
classes and the bond market combined.

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:15.139
And more importantly,

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:17.620
Papa's gave me a second chance
to get my priorities straight.

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:21.528
It's just here on the right.

01:23:42.785 --> 01:23:44.785
So, I know it's not what we had,

01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:46.487
but we can fix it up.

01:23:46.489 --> 01:23:48.589
I think it has
a lot of potential.

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.670
Three bedrooms, two and a half
baths, so there's room to grow.

01:24:00.403 --> 01:24:01.602
It's perfect.

01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:03.170
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:08.277 --> 01:24:09.576
Jim: It's always troubled me

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:11.578
that those who cannot afford
financial services

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.614
are usually the ones
who need it most.

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:15.416
So,
at Adams Financial Management,

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:17.518
we decided
to make it a priority.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.553
Beyond rekindling
my fire for finance,

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:22.289
it's allowed me to keep in touch
with people I care about.

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:25.726
Jacqui and her husband, Derek, saved
enough to get their daughter to college.

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:29.263
Mary and Billy got divorced,
then remarried,

01:24:29.265 --> 01:24:30.881
then got another divorce,

01:24:30.882 --> 01:24:33.002
but are planning to get
remarried again in the spring.

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:37.104
Manuel and his family decided
to start their own restaurant.

01:24:37.106 --> 01:24:40.507
I was hired as an advisor, but what
they really needed was a referee.

01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:46.080
Edward still works the grill
over at the airport location.

01:24:48.284 --> 01:24:51.385
And two days a week, we work
the bags over at Anthony's.

01:24:53.389 --> 01:24:55.289
Get it out, Jimmy.

01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:03.163
- Jim: Getting better.
- Edward: Yeah.

01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:04.631
- Jim: I'm coming for you.
- Edward: You got it.

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:06.533
Edward: Let's see it, okay.

01:25:09.171 --> 01:25:11.238
Edward: Yeah, give it to me.

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:14.508
Edward: Get it all out.

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:20.414
Edward: You got it, baby. You got it.
You're smoking, Jimmy. Smoking.
