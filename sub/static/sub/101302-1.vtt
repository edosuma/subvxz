01:59.228 --> 02:00.595
I get it.

02:01.030 --> 02:02.431
I get it.

02:04.266 --> 02:07.970
We are a half hour into a
ten day trip around Europe.

02:08.004 --> 02:10.638
And you decide now is a
good time to bring it up.

02:12.475 --> 02:14.576
I'm wearing
shorts, yeah?

02:15.978 --> 02:17.579
With these legs.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.950
I spent about 20 quid
on sun cream.

02:20.983 --> 02:22.051
That's like...

02:22.952 --> 02:24.086
That's ten pound
per leg.

02:25.988 --> 02:28.290
I spent three weeks
growing this beard.

02:28.324 --> 02:29.724
This here beard.

02:30.226 --> 02:31.626
Cultivating it.

02:32.794 --> 02:33.628
Length.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.530
And now you
decide to tell me

02:35.563 --> 02:36.765
you don't like it.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.567
Okay, I'm very sorry.

02:39.601 --> 02:41.470
I didn't know it meant
that much to you.

02:41.504 --> 02:44.106
I grew this beard
because it's trendy.

02:45.174 --> 02:46.509
It makes me trendy.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.478
You're not trendy.

02:49.512 --> 02:52.281
You're just jealous 'cause
you can't grow a beard.

02:52.314 --> 02:53.482
Yeah.

02:54.316 --> 02:55.518
Yeah.

02:56.618 --> 02:57.987
But you know
what I can do?

02:59.288 --> 03:01.556
I can grow
everything else.

03:05.961 --> 03:07.930
What do you mean?

03:07.963 --> 03:12.368
Well, I mean, I just
won't shave anything.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.538
For... the rest
of the trip?

03:15.570 --> 03:17.839
You know, not my,
not my legs.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.076
Not my armpits.

03:21.177 --> 03:22.677
Not my vagina.

03:26.449 --> 03:28.683
But what do you hope
to achieve by doing that?

03:30.819 --> 03:31.887
Nothing.

03:34.523 --> 03:36.058
You're just
being childish.

03:36.992 --> 03:38.160
Fine.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.664
I'm not shaving.

04:52.902 --> 04:54.904
<i>That'll do.
Just a little trim.</i>

05:18.826 --> 05:20.795
Hello, Mum. No.

05:25.234 --> 05:26.635
Bow chicka wow wow.

05:26.669 --> 05:27.869
Oh, stop it.

05:35.678 --> 05:37.546
- What are you doing?
- What?

05:38.380 --> 05:39.915
You're filming me?

05:39.949 --> 05:41.584
I thought that's why
we bought the camera.

05:41.617 --> 05:44.553
No, we did not buy
a GoPro to film a sex tape.

05:44.587 --> 05:46.922
- Then why did we buy it?
- You know why we bought it.

05:46.956 --> 05:48.257
To document our trip.

05:48.290 --> 05:50.526
Oh, brilliant.

05:54.930 --> 05:57.066
- Is that it, then?
- What do you think?

05:57.099 --> 05:59.068
- But I've got a hard-on.
- Good night, Chris.

06:03.005 --> 06:04.173
I love you.

06:08.210 --> 06:09.511
Now you're
putting me off, mate.

06:10.546 --> 06:11.947
You're putting me
right off.

06:16.685 --> 06:18.053
Just me
and you now.

06:41.744 --> 06:43.379
Didn't think
to put on pants?

06:43.412 --> 06:44.812

06:56.525 --> 06:58.427

08:20.509 --> 08:22.344
Well, Nice seems lovely.

08:22.378 --> 08:24.747
Don't start, Chris.
I'm not in the mood.

08:24.780 --> 08:27.116
- For what?
- For you being a sarcy twat.

08:27.449 --> 08:28.550
Sorry.

08:30.352 --> 08:31.453
Do people actually
live in Nice?

08:31.487 --> 08:33.822
What did I say?

08:33.856 --> 08:36.024
It's late. Everyone's in bed,
which is where we should be.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.329
Should we just start
walking or something?

08:40.362 --> 08:41.397
Walking where?

08:41.430 --> 08:43.031
I don't know,
find the nearest hostel.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.366
What, just walk
in a random direction

08:44.400 --> 08:46.702
- and hope to find a hostel?
- Yeah.

08:48.337 --> 08:50.038
What do you think,
left or right?

08:51.974 --> 08:53.108
Left?

08:56.211 --> 08:57.246

while I'm up here...

10:21.330 --> 10:23.832
Chris, you are literally
5 foot off the ground.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.001
I know, but...

10:26.835 --> 10:28.570
You can drown
in an inch of water.

10:29.638 --> 10:31.507
What's that got to do
with anything?

10:33.977 --> 10:35.010
Well I was thinking...

10:36.913 --> 10:38.847
What if I do a wizz in the
middle of the night,

10:40.582 --> 10:43.585
and it trickles down into
your mouth and drowns you?

10:45.854 --> 10:47.523
Do you ever think
about anything you say

10:47.556 --> 10:48.892
before you
actually say it?

10:50.259 --> 10:51.460
Not really. No.

10:52.794 --> 10:54.630
Our lives would just be

10:54.663 --> 10:57.065
really long, awkward silences,
wouldn't they?

11:00.035 --> 11:02.838
Trust me, it's just
as awkward without them.

No, get a hostel.

- Just like that?

12:46.441 --> 12:47.476
Not even
gonna deny it?

12:47.509 --> 12:49.078
Why would
I deny it?

12:49.112 --> 12:50.079
'Cause she's

12:50.113 --> 12:51.680
- I want to boom-boom her.
- Stop saying that.

12:51.713 --> 12:53.082
I'm gonna
boom-boom you.

12:53.116 --> 12:54.449
- You wanna fuck me?
- No.

Not lick, kick.

- Are you guy?
- No, I'm not gay.

So?

13:52.141 --> 13:53.308
They put a finger
up my arse.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.146
You get into a fight and they
put a finger up my arse.

13:57.180 --> 13:58.014
How does that work?

13:58.580 --> 14:00.248
Oh, my God!

14:00.282 --> 14:01.984
- Are you okay?
- It's not funny.

14:02.684 --> 14:03.886
And they fine me.

14:04.786 --> 14:07.289
- Five hundred euro.
- Five hundred euros?

14:07.322 --> 14:08.958
Well, that's like half
our budget.

14:08.991 --> 14:11.127
- I know.
- It's mental.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.861
Shit. What are we
gonna do?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.796
I think I dislodged
my anus.

14:14.830 --> 14:15.864
Is that
even possible?

14:15.898 --> 14:17.166
Chris, come on.
This is serious.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.400
I'm being serious.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.635
Five hundred euros
for a finger up me arse.

14:20.669 --> 14:22.171
And the French
have got big fingers.

14:23.638 --> 14:26.842
Look, I'll see if my mom
can transfer that money.

14:26.876 --> 14:28.911
- You think she will?
- Of course she will.

14:31.546 --> 14:34.150
All right then.
Okay.

Love you. Bye, bye.

14:43.325 --> 14:44.559
What's that?

14:44.593 --> 14:46.062
It's all they had.

14:46.095 --> 14:47.163
Oh, give it here.

14:49.831 --> 14:51.333
Well?

14:51.366 --> 14:53.435
She wasn't in.
I left a message.

14:53.468 --> 14:54.904
Oh, great so we just
sort of stand here

14:54.937 --> 14:56.973
and wait until she ring us
back, then, shall we, dickhead?

14:57.006 --> 14:59.574
I left a message
explaining the situation.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.211
Also to transfer 500 euros
into our account.

15:02.245 --> 15:04.080
Said I'd call back a bit later.

15:04.113 --> 15:05.814
I should really get some
credit for this thing.

15:07.216 --> 15:08.217
Dick brain.

15:10.552 --> 15:11.820
You tell her
you got arrested?

15:12.621 --> 15:15.258
It was a message.
I left a message.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.492
Yeah, but how did you say
that we lost the money?

15:17.526 --> 15:18.627
It was a message.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.328
But what did you say?

15:20.362 --> 15:21.530
It was a message.

15:21.563 --> 15:23.398
Do you not understand
the concept of a message?

15:23.431 --> 15:24.566
You're trying
to be funny?

15:24.599 --> 15:26.434
Just had a finger
up my arse, yeah?

15:26.468 --> 15:27.937
Just had to ring my mum
to ask for some money.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.704
If that's not funny then what is?

15:32.074 --> 15:33.642
All right, fine.

15:33.675 --> 15:35.111
What do you
wanna do until then?

15:36.344 --> 15:38.281
- All right, pub?
- Pub.

15:42.384 --> 15:43.886
You know,
I was talking to my mum

15:43.920 --> 15:45.888
and she thinks
that a trip like this

15:45.922 --> 15:47.489
is gonna make us
or break us.

15:47.522 --> 15:48.590
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:48.623 --> 15:49.926
What about you?

15:49.959 --> 15:51.660
Do you think
same as your mum?

15:51.693 --> 15:54.997
I think that we've been together
for quite long time, so.

15:56.132 --> 15:58.301
I think if we can't last
a couple of weeks together,

15:58.333 --> 16:00.368
we're up shit creek,
really, aren't we?

16:01.469 --> 16:02.737
Right, then.

16:02.771 --> 16:04.207
Let's say we drink a couple
of these bad boys and...

16:05.007 --> 16:06.842
have a look around
this shit hole.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.459
- Orange gina.
- Orangina.

16:57.492 --> 16:58.727
Orange gina.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.196
Listen to me.
Orangina.

17:00.229 --> 17:02.397
Listen to me.
Orange gina.

17:02.430 --> 17:03.933
How can you not hear
that that's not the same?

17:03.966 --> 17:06.735
<i>Allo.</i> Uh, order.

17:06.768 --> 17:10.405
Oh.
Check this out.

17:10.438 --> 17:14.944
We
would like to order some lunch,

17:15.410 --> 17:16.711
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

17:19.481 --> 17:20.615
Come again?

17:23.152 --> 17:25.754
Um...

17:25.787 --> 17:28.958
I will let my girlfriend
take over from me.

17:29.858 --> 17:30.893
All yours.

17:31.394 --> 17:32.861
Um...

17:40.970 --> 17:42.104
Yeah, <i>oui,</i> mate.

17:42.138 --> 17:43.805
Kapti proti pu.

17:44.639 --> 17:45.640
<i>D'accord.</i>

17:46.275 --> 17:47.676
<i>Merci.</i>

17:47.709 --> 17:49.045
What did you order, anyway?

17:57.519 --> 17:58.955
Just the four fish, then?

18:15.570 --> 18:17.440
Fucking hell,
it's beautiful, isn't it?

18:17.472 --> 18:20.042
Which I can't believe
we just found it.

18:20.076 --> 18:22.510
I-I can't believe
I'm seeing it with you.

18:22.544 --> 18:24.113
Shut up!

18:24.146 --> 18:27.316
No, I wouldn't do anything
like this without you, would I?

18:27.350 --> 18:30.618
'Cause I'm, like,
just a fucking idiot all the time.

18:30.652 --> 18:34.156
Poncing around like a bloody dinosaur.

18:38.626 --> 18:39.895
Run away,
run away.

18:39.929 --> 18:41.563
Oh, you make
me laugh, you idiot.

18:46.135 --> 18:47.436
After you.

20:54.497 --> 20:56.165
I can't see any
al fresco on this menu.

20:58.067 --> 20:59.634
What?
What do you mean?

21:00.369 --> 21:01.703
Al fresco.

21:01.736 --> 21:03.939
A mate wanted
to eat al fresco

21:03.973 --> 21:05.608
when you go
to a foreign land.

21:07.675 --> 21:11.580
Yeah, but Chris, you know
that's not a dish, right?

21:11.614 --> 21:13.781
That's just
eating outside.

21:14.984 --> 21:16.851
- Oh.
- Yeah.

21:16.886 --> 21:19.255
- Fucking hell.
- Thought it was some sort of salad.

21:32.867 --> 21:35.638
Oh, okay we're in. We're in.
How do, how we do this?

21:35.670 --> 21:37.072
Just, just
kiss me.

21:39.408 --> 21:41.277
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Fuck me in the toilet.

21:41.310 --> 21:42.777
We've never done that.

21:43.711 --> 21:45.713
I've got a dress on
so it'll be really easy.

21:46.714 --> 21:48.984
Just hike it up.
You know what I mean?

21:49.018 --> 21:50.286
Okay.

21:55.790 --> 21:57.560
- Shit. Ah.
- Ah, shit.

21:57.593 --> 21:59.861
Oh, you look amazing.
Ah, shit.

21:59.895 --> 22:01.564
- Yeah, shit.
- Yeah.

22:01.597 --> 22:02.932
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

22:02.965 --> 22:04.567
I can't believe
we're doing this.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.069
Oh, shit.
Ah, shit.

22:07.102 --> 22:09.638
- Oh shit, oh shit. Oh shit!
- Ah shit, yeah.

22:09.672 --> 22:12.107
- Oh shit. Oh...
- What you mean? What you mean?

22:12.141 --> 22:13.775
Oh my God! Shit!

22:13.808 --> 22:17.479
- Oh, shit.
- Look I love you, but I can't unsee this.

22:17.513 --> 22:19.747
- Oh! I need to get out.
- No.

22:19.781 --> 22:20.916
- I need to get out.
- No.

22:20.950 --> 22:22.585
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't you dare!

22:22.618 --> 22:23.818
- I've got to get out.
- No! No.

22:23.851 --> 22:25.321
- Don't you dare get out!
- I've got to get out.

22:25.354 --> 22:26.721
- You can't... Chris, stop!
- I've got to get out.

22:26.754 --> 22:28.057
- Stop, stop...
- I've got to get out.

22:28.090 --> 22:29.558
Please, I've got it pouring out of me.

22:29.592 --> 22:30.626
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

22:30.659 --> 22:31.660
Ugh, it's so bad.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.935
No! Stop it.

22:39.969 --> 22:41.170
Stop it. Oh, God!

22:41.203 --> 22:43.272
Ah, it's still coming.
God, it's still coming.

22:43.305 --> 22:44.340
It's like lava.

22:44.373 --> 22:45.873
Ugh, oh, God!

22:48.843 --> 22:50.512
Oh, my God,
I cannot believe

22:50.546 --> 22:52.847
that we just got chucked
off a train. Fuck!

22:54.617 --> 22:56.252
It's not like
having a shit's illegal.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.520
Well, it should be.

22:58.554 --> 23:00.189
I've never smelled
anything like that.

23:00.222 --> 23:01.957
Oh, thanks for the sympathy.

23:01.991 --> 23:03.825
How can I sympathize
with that shit?

23:05.594 --> 23:07.029
I'm hungry.

23:07.062 --> 23:09.331
- Can you pass me your bag?
- Why?

23:09.365 --> 23:10.466
I want to get
a chocolate bar.

23:10.499 --> 23:12.767
Ugh, God, can't you just
wait for the train?

23:12.800 --> 23:14.069
It's like a four hour wait.

23:17.072 --> 23:18.907
Ugh, don't wanna get them
out of my bag.

23:20.509 --> 23:21.809
You ate them all, didn't you?

23:23.379 --> 23:24.779
What?

23:24.812 --> 23:26.015
You ate all the chocolate bars.

23:26.048 --> 23:28.317
No, I did not eat
all the fucking chocolate bars!

23:28.350 --> 23:30.252
You so did.
That's your lying face.

23:30.286 --> 23:31.520
I don't have a lying face.

23:31.553 --> 23:33.889
Everybody has a lying face,
and that's yours.

23:38.027 --> 23:39.662
All right,
maybe I did eat a few.

23:40.362 --> 23:42.331
I was hungry in the night.

23:42.364 --> 23:43.798
Fucking hell!

23:43.831 --> 23:46.101
There were like ten
chocolate bars in there.

23:46.135 --> 23:47.169
No wonder you shit yourself.

23:47.202 --> 23:49.104
There were not like
ten chocolate bars in there.

23:49.138 --> 23:50.838
- How many were there, then?
- I don't know.

23:52.007 --> 23:53.075
Nine?

23:53.108 --> 23:54.910
You ate nine whole
chocolate bars?

23:55.978 --> 23:58.347
Well, two of them
were Freddos

23:58.380 --> 24:01.150
and we all know that Freddos aren't
really proper chocolate bars, are they?

24:02.117 --> 24:03.152
You ate the Freddos?

24:03.786 --> 24:05.321
You know I love a Freddo.

24:05.354 --> 24:07.656
It's my favorite.

24:07.690 --> 24:09.124
Did you even think about me
while you were doing it?

24:09.158 --> 24:11.627
Oh, come on, Chris!
I wasn't fucking someone.

24:11.660 --> 24:14.163
I was hungry
and I had some chocolate.

24:14.196 --> 24:15.264
Some chocolate?

24:15.297 --> 24:16.498
Some chocolate?

24:16.532 --> 24:18.701
A couple of Roses at Christmas
is some chocolate.

24:18.734 --> 24:21.270
A line of Fruit & Nut
is some chocolate.

24:21.303 --> 24:22.471
Nine chocolate bars

24:22.504 --> 24:24.773
is a whole fucking
entire universe of chocolate.

24:24.807 --> 24:27.576
Oh, well, thank God you're
not being dramatic about it.

24:27.609 --> 24:29.144
Dramatic?

24:29.178 --> 24:31.980
You always do this,
make me out to be dramatic.

24:32.014 --> 24:33.949
You'd do the same if the
boot was on the other foot.

24:33.982 --> 24:35.117
No, I wouldn't.

24:35.150 --> 24:37.953
You so would. You so would.

24:37.986 --> 24:39.722
Do I have to remind you
about nacho-gate?

24:39.755 --> 24:41.757
Oh, no, you don't have to remind
me, because you know why?

24:41.790 --> 24:44.893
We always, always go back
to fucking nacho-gate

24:44.927 --> 24:46.228
and you throw them
right in my face

24:46.261 --> 24:48.464
anytime we have this argument.

24:48.497 --> 24:49.698
It was an accident

24:49.732 --> 24:51.500
and you didn't speak to me
for three whole days.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.602
Yes, because it was
an idiotic thing to do!

24:53.635 --> 24:55.604
I sat on some nachos!

24:55.637 --> 24:56.939
And not only that,
they were cheap nachos.

24:56.972 --> 24:59.274
Does it have anything to do
with how cheap they were?

24:59.308 --> 25:00.542
It's a matter of principles.

25:00.576 --> 25:02.010
Do nachos have principles?

25:02.044 --> 25:03.712
- Human beings do!
- Human beings?

25:03.746 --> 25:05.781
Have you actually heard the words that
are coming out your mouth right now?

25:05.814 --> 25:07.883
Yeah, I have, actually.
And do you wanna hear another thing?

25:07.916 --> 25:12.221
You are a stupid, imbecilic,
lazy, big-toed,

25:12.254 --> 25:15.257
hairy lips,
slightly stretchy,

25:15.290 --> 25:16.492
- one-balled...
- Oh!

25:16.525 --> 25:19.962
- ...dead-eyed, little buggy...
- Oh!

25:19.995 --> 25:21.463
...massive nosed,

25:21.497 --> 25:22.498
- fucking...
- Mmm.

25:22.531 --> 25:23.499
- ...hairy...
- Mmm.

25:23.532 --> 25:25.901
- ...bollocked dick!
- Yeah?

25:25.934 --> 25:26.668
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

25:26.702 --> 25:27.736
Well, hear this!

25:27.770 --> 25:30.806
You ponder about
like a fucking snail!

25:30.839 --> 25:34.376
You juice like a snail,
you smell like a snail.

25:34.410 --> 25:35.944
Do you know what?
Hear this!

25:35.978 --> 25:39.114
You are a little, snidey,
curly-haired,

25:39.148 --> 25:42.651
slightly balding,
slightly disgusting prick!

25:42.684 --> 25:44.486
Yeah? Well, hear this.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.221
You, you, you,

25:46.255 --> 25:48.390
boo, boo, boo, boo, boo,

25:48.424 --> 25:50.292
constant fucking moan,

25:50.325 --> 25:51.727
year round moan,

25:51.760 --> 25:53.529
centuries of moaning.

25:53.562 --> 25:55.964
You are a sprouty eye-browed,

25:55.998 --> 25:57.699
sprouty nose-haired,

25:57.733 --> 25:59.835
stupid, slightly imbecilic,

25:59.868 --> 26:02.070
little bit
of a fucking old man.

26:02.104 --> 26:03.972
But do you know what?
You wanna hear another thing, too?

26:04.006 --> 26:06.408
You are a lopsided, cross-eyed,

26:06.442 --> 26:10.245
red-nosed little buck tooth
Wrigley's Extra little prick!

26:10.279 --> 26:11.113
Yeah?

26:11.146 --> 26:13.148
Well, you're a moany,
hairy-legged,

26:13.182 --> 26:14.750
mooncuppy bitch!

26:15.951 --> 26:17.753
Really?

26:17.786 --> 26:18.821
Really? You really went there.

26:18.854 --> 26:20.289
- Did you actually just say that?
- Yes.

26:20.322 --> 26:21.356
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, well, well done.

26:21.390 --> 26:22.591
Well done. Goodbye.

26:28.564 --> 26:29.731
She'll come back.

26:35.571 --> 26:38.874
<i>♪ You were in the sun

26:38.908 --> 26:41.743

27:47.676 --> 27:48.878
What are you doing?

27:48.912 --> 27:50.178
I'm dancing!

27:50.212 --> 27:52.047
I can see that. But...

27:52.882 --> 27:54.349
I think maybe we should go.

27:54.383 --> 27:55.919
What? Why?

27:55.952 --> 27:57.786
Because...

27:57.819 --> 27:59.989
every guy in here
wants to do it with you.

28:00.722 --> 28:01.925
Especially him.

28:02.959 --> 28:06.029
You think?
Is that a bad thing?

28:06.061 --> 28:08.230
Well, it doesn't sit that well with
me, to be honest, no.

28:08.263 --> 28:09.398
Well, look,

28:09.431 --> 28:11.500
we've got at least three hours
until our train, right?

28:11.533 --> 28:12.634
- Yes.
- Right?

28:12.668 --> 28:13.635
So what do you wanna do?

28:13.669 --> 28:15.038
Sit out there in the cold?

28:15.070 --> 28:16.538
Or would you wanna
come down here

28:16.572 --> 28:18.206
and have a hot dance with me?

28:18.574 --> 28:19.808
Uh...

28:20.576 --> 28:21.978
Come on!

29:02.751 --> 29:05.220
But do you remember
the first time you saw me?

29:05.253 --> 29:07.189
- When you actually saw me?
- No.

29:08.624 --> 29:09.926
Of course I do!

29:11.193 --> 29:12.561
It was on Facebook.

29:12.594 --> 29:13.795
I was stalking you.

29:13.829 --> 29:15.230
- What?
- Yeah.

29:15.263 --> 29:16.264
Like a pervert.

29:16.298 --> 29:18.467
- Ugh, people do that?
- Yeah, no...

29:18.500 --> 29:21.336
I sort of found
a bikini picture...

29:23.238 --> 29:24.272
It was... I think...

29:24.306 --> 29:26.441
I think I saw you
on Mike's profile.

29:26.475 --> 29:27.643
It was, like, a group photo.

29:27.676 --> 29:28.878
Oh, really?

29:28.911 --> 29:30.846
- Mmm.
- And what did you think?

29:30.880 --> 29:33.082
I thought you were
the loveliest girl

29:33.482 --> 29:34.616
I'd ever seen.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.085
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:36.119 --> 29:38.087
And what about now?

29:38.121 --> 29:40.056
- Honestly?
- Mmm-hmm.

29:40.089 --> 29:42.691
I think you've
let yourself go a little bit.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.995
Oh, come on! I'm joking.

29:46.029 --> 29:49.032
Everyone knows I'm punching.

29:49.065 --> 29:51.968
Punching above my weight.

29:52.534 --> 29:53.936
You're gorgeous.

29:53.970 --> 29:56.072
You're everything
in the right place.

29:56.105 --> 29:58.206
Apart from that bit of shit
in your teeth.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.441
- Oh, what? Have I?
- Yeah.

29:59.474 --> 30:01.343
You've always got something
in them grotbags, haven't you?

30:01.376 --> 30:02.344
What? No.

30:02.377 --> 30:03.578
- It's in the corner.
- Get it.

30:03.612 --> 30:04.947
Your left molar.

30:04.981 --> 30:06.015
There you go.

30:06.049 --> 30:07.950
See, don't say
I don't do anything for you.

30:07.984 --> 30:09.018
Well, you don't.

30:09.052 --> 30:09.986
- What?
- You don't!

30:10.019 --> 30:12.121
I just picked some shit
out of your teeth.

30:12.155 --> 30:14.222
And... Oh, so you know those

30:14.256 --> 30:18.094
pictures that I said I was gonna
put up for the last three months?

30:18.127 --> 30:19.194
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

30:19.227 --> 30:21.697
Well, as soon as we get home,
I'm going to do it.

30:21.730 --> 30:23.265
Are you?

30:23.298 --> 30:25.534
- No.
- No? What? Why?

30:25.567 --> 30:26.702
I haven't got a hammer.

30:26.735 --> 30:28.837
Well, you can always
buy a hammer.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.305
What for?

30:30.338 --> 30:32.708
Well, you probably need it for all
the hamming you're gonna be doing.

30:32.741 --> 30:35.044
I think you'll find
that it's called hammering.

30:35.078 --> 30:38.147
Jesus, woman, do you know
nothing about DIY?

30:38.181 --> 30:39.381
Woman!

30:39.414 --> 30:43.119
Well, you know nothing
about women, man!

30:43.152 --> 30:44.820
What was the last thing
you bought me?

30:45.220 --> 30:46.488
Uh...

30:46.521 --> 30:48.590
Well, a lovely underwear set.

30:48.623 --> 30:50.993
What, the crotchess pants?

30:51.027 --> 30:53.295
Wasn't to start with, was it?

30:54.796 --> 30:57.532
Babe, I don't want
crotchess pants, do I?

30:57.566 --> 30:59.801
I want flowers,
and chocolates, and diamonds.

30:59.835 --> 31:01.603
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:01.636 --> 31:03.538
Hold your horses!

31:03.572 --> 31:05.208
No, no, no, no.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.341
Not weddings, Chris.

31:06.374 --> 31:07.709
- Don't lose your shit.
- Aye.

31:07.743 --> 31:10.712
Just, you know, a little,
little, little tiny something,

31:10.746 --> 31:11.914
just a little something,

31:11.948 --> 31:13.648
just a little, tiny something

31:13.682 --> 31:15.851
so I know you care
about me sometimes.

31:15.885 --> 31:17.220
- What...
- Just a little.

31:18.253 --> 31:19.755
What, you think
I don't care about you?

31:19.788 --> 31:21.523
No, I think you care about me.

31:21.556 --> 31:23.126
Good.

31:23.159 --> 31:25.293
You should think
yourself lucky.

31:25.327 --> 31:28.330
And stop your moaning.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.500
How long
have we been in here?

31:31.533 --> 31:32.567
I don't know.

31:32.601 --> 31:33.835
I feel like it...

31:34.870 --> 31:36.738
- There was a train we were supposed to...
- Fuck!

31:36.772 --> 31:38.241
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

32:23.552 --> 32:25.687
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

32:25.720 --> 32:28.024
<i>Buongiorno, Milano!</i>

32:28.057 --> 32:29.892
- We made it to Italia.
- Yeah.

32:29.926 --> 32:32.694
We're here.
The home of fashion.

32:33.495 --> 32:34.529
<i>♪ Fashion</i>

32:36.232 --> 32:38.100
<i>♪ Fashion, fashion</i>

32:41.204 --> 32:43.605
I don't... I've got nothing
to rhyme with that.

33:21.143 --> 33:22.345
Hello!

33:23.511 --> 33:24.779
So, we're in Milan.

33:25.814 --> 33:28.117
Having a nice time.

33:28.150 --> 33:30.353
Lucy's just popped
into the, uh...

33:30.385 --> 33:32.154
pharmacy.
Get some lady bits.

33:33.890 --> 33:35.324
Thought we'd get a shaver.

33:35.358 --> 33:36.625
Sort that rat out.

33:37.525 --> 33:39.128
Never seen anything
like it.

33:39.828 --> 33:41.197
Hello, Lucy's Mum.

33:42.564 --> 33:43.865
So, uh...

33:43.900 --> 33:45.234
we're having a lovely time.

33:46.035 --> 33:48.137
Had a little slip up in Nice.

33:48.170 --> 33:51.374
Nothing too much to worry about, though.
Sort of all right.

33:51.406 --> 33:52.275
- And, uh...
- What are you doing?

33:52.308 --> 33:54.176
...we're off to Venice.
Hello!

33:54.210 --> 33:55.378
The love of my life.

33:55.410 --> 33:56.879
Right, come on.

33:56.913 --> 33:58.780
We need to find a loo
somewhere, okay?

33:58.813 --> 33:59.648
Okay.

34:00.316 --> 34:01.583
Probably needs a shit.

34:02.051 --> 34:02.885
See you soon.

34:46.828 --> 34:48.197
It's beautiful, innit?

34:48.230 --> 34:49.065
It really is.

34:50.632 --> 34:51.934
Oh!

34:51.968 --> 34:54.636
Oh, phone's ringing.
The old Mom. Oh!

35:03.446 --> 35:04.313
Lucy.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.382
Lucy, Lucy.

35:07.716 --> 35:08.951
I don't think
we're gonna fix that.

35:09.952 --> 35:10.785
Don't you?

35:11.320 --> 35:12.487
Really?

35:12.520 --> 35:13.788
Not smashed up, is it?

35:17.159 --> 35:18.493
We're just gonna have to

35:18.526 --> 35:20.329
find a payphone
and ring your mum.

35:20.363 --> 35:22.031
- How?
- What do you mean, how?

35:23.132 --> 35:24.632
Well, I don't know
my mum's number.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.869
You... You don't know
your own mum's number?

35:28.670 --> 35:30.538
I don't know anyone's number.

35:30.572 --> 35:32.108
Once I put it in my phone
once, that's it.

35:32.141 --> 35:34.944
My mum's number just becomes
"Mum" every time she calls me.

35:34.977 --> 35:36.745
Well, haven't you got it
written down somewhere?

35:36.778 --> 35:38.114
Oh, yeah, yeah.

35:38.147 --> 35:39.181
In my phone.

35:39.215 --> 35:40.815
So how are you gonna
get in touch with her, then?

35:40.849 --> 35:42.218
Well...

35:42.251 --> 35:45.121
do you remember when I said
we should bring your phone?

35:45.154 --> 35:46.355
How's that gonna help?

35:46.389 --> 35:48.958
Well, you could ring your mum
and ask her to call my mum.

35:48.991 --> 35:50.960
How is she going to do that?

35:50.993 --> 35:52.928
Well, doesn't your mum
have my mum's number?

35:53.329 --> 35:54.330
No.

35:54.363 --> 35:55.797
They've literally met twice.

35:55.830 --> 35:56.999
And your mum got so pissed

35:57.033 --> 35:59.068
that she threw up
all over my mum's shoes.

36:00.635 --> 36:02.138
Classic Heller.

36:03.772 --> 36:06.342
- Can we e-mail her?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

36:06.375 --> 36:07.642
Let me just
whip out me laptop.

36:07.675 --> 36:08.944
Well, I don't mean now.

36:08.978 --> 36:11.113
- I mean, tomorrow or something.
- Oh.

36:11.147 --> 36:13.349
My mum has no idea
what an e-mail is.

36:14.283 --> 36:15.918
So what are we
going to do then?

36:15.951 --> 36:17.920
I don't know, carrier pigeon?

36:19.355 --> 36:21.057
<i>♪ Down all day</i>

36:22.525 --> 36:23.993
<i>♪ Up all night</i>

36:31.167 --> 36:32.101
Hey, you.

36:34.569 --> 36:35.737
We'd like a room, please.

36:35.770 --> 36:37.206
Sure thing. A single?

36:37.239 --> 36:38.541
Oh, no. A... A double.

36:38.573 --> 36:39.741
A double?

36:39.774 --> 36:41.944
Oh, right.
Traveling with a girlfriend.

36:41.977 --> 36:43.145
Uh, yeah.

36:44.180 --> 36:46.248
Why did you say
"ugh" like that?

36:46.282 --> 36:47.816
- It wasn't like "ugh," was it?
- Yeah, it was.

36:47.849 --> 36:49.351
- Can I see your passports?
- Yeah.

36:54.390 --> 36:55.324
Cute.

36:55.991 --> 36:57.026
Thanks.

36:57.059 --> 36:59.028
- Are you being serious?
- What?

36:59.061 --> 37:00.628
So is it just
for the one night?

37:00.662 --> 37:02.264
Yes, yeah,
just the one night.

37:02.298 --> 37:03.399
Such a shame.

37:03.432 --> 37:05.367
Well, breakfast is at 9:00.
It's an extra 10 euros,

37:05.401 --> 37:07.869
but come and see me, I'll sort you out.

37:07.903 --> 37:08.736
Thanks.

37:08.770 --> 37:10.306
It's still gonna be
10 euros for you.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.408
Oh.

37:16.178 --> 37:18.247
Room 8, just take the lift
to the second floor.

37:18.847 --> 37:19.949
Thanks.

37:19.982 --> 37:21.749
I'll be here all night
if you need anything.

37:21.783 --> 37:23.085
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:23.119 --> 37:24.353
Okay.

37:25.221 --> 37:26.821
That's lovely. Fantastic.

37:45.441 --> 37:46.841
That was a bit weird,
wasn't it?

37:51.447 --> 37:52.414
Chris.

37:56.452 --> 37:57.586
Chris?

37:59.221 --> 38:00.122
Ow.

38:01.323 --> 38:02.191
Ow!

38:06.495 --> 38:07.662
What happened?

38:09.131 --> 38:10.199
Oh, hi, honey.

38:13.502 --> 38:14.802
Did you punch me
in the head?

38:16.038 --> 38:17.839
What? No.

38:19.975 --> 38:21.676
It feels like
you punched me in the head.

38:22.211 --> 38:23.212
Well, I didn't.

38:24.113 --> 38:25.847
If you had have
punched me in the head...

38:26.714 --> 38:28.050
would you lie about it?

38:29.285 --> 38:30.219
Yes.

38:31.153 --> 38:32.087
Yes, I would.

38:34.056 --> 38:34.924
See...

38:36.025 --> 38:38.793
now that you've said
you would lie about it,

38:38.826 --> 38:41.230
that makes me think that
you did punch me in the head.

38:43.265 --> 38:44.699
Yeah, I...

38:44.732 --> 38:46.302
I can see why
it would look like that.

38:47.303 --> 38:48.637
And knock me out?

38:48.671 --> 38:50.838
You may have blacked out
for a little bit.

38:51.540 --> 38:52.774
A little bit?

38:52.807 --> 38:54.709
Well... Well, how long?

38:55.311 --> 38:56.278
About an hour.

38:57.279 --> 38:58.247
An hour?

39:00.382 --> 39:02.251
Well, how did I
get on the bed?

39:02.284 --> 39:03.785
I carried you.

39:04.587 --> 39:06.155
You carried me?

39:06.188 --> 39:08.290
Yeah, I thought you'd think that
you just fell asleep or something.

39:08.691 --> 39:09.824
Oh, nice.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.561
Right, so just to clarify,

39:12.595 --> 39:14.096
you did punch me in the head.

39:14.597 --> 39:15.698
Yeah.

39:16.899 --> 39:18.000
Right.

39:18.033 --> 39:20.002
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a walk.

39:20.802 --> 39:22.338
Well, it's really late.

39:22.371 --> 39:24.573
Yeah? Well, I'd probably be safer
out there than I will in here,

39:24.607 --> 39:25.941
you violent assaultist.

39:27.842 --> 39:29.111
See you later, Rocky Balboa.

39:43.559 --> 39:44.627
Hi.

39:45.361 --> 39:47.029
- Oh, hi.
- Do you want one?

39:47.997 --> 39:49.265
Ooh.

39:49.298 --> 39:50.299
Don't mind if I do.

39:51.133 --> 39:52.268
Like a cheeky old fag.

39:53.402 --> 39:54.637
Cigarettes.

39:55.070 --> 39:56.005
Hmm.

40:03.479 --> 40:05.748
- You okay?
- Yep. I'm... I'm Chris.

40:06.048 --> 40:07.016
Carli.

40:07.416 --> 40:08.783
Thanks.

40:08.816 --> 40:11.320
Um... Am I bleeding?

40:11.353 --> 40:13.222
Bleeding?
No. Why?

40:13.255 --> 40:14.123
What did you do?

40:14.156 --> 40:16.158
My girlfriend punched me.

40:16.191 --> 40:17.693
- She did?
- Yeah.

40:17.726 --> 40:18.761
Why?

40:19.361 --> 40:21.030
Probably because of you.

40:21.063 --> 40:22.264
Because of me?

40:22.298 --> 40:23.666
Mmm, what did I do?

40:24.166 --> 40:25.134
Well...

40:26.001 --> 40:28.103
she thought
you were flirting with me.

40:28.671 --> 40:29.871
I was.

40:30.272 --> 40:31.206
Oh.

40:32.474 --> 40:33.942
That'll...

40:33.976 --> 40:35.878
That'd be why she was annoyed, then.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.379
So how long have
you guys been together?

40:38.013 --> 40:39.048
Uh...

40:40.282 --> 40:41.750
Going on a year and a half.

40:41.784 --> 40:43.385
- You happy?
- Um...

40:44.420 --> 40:46.789
Yeah. Yeah, we'd...

40:46.821 --> 40:48.957
We have the occasional spat.

40:49.525 --> 40:50.993
You gonna get married?

40:51.026 --> 40:52.394
Well, I don't know about that.

40:53.828 --> 40:56.498
What about you?
Have you got a fella, a chap?

40:56.532 --> 40:58.734
No. All alone.

40:58.767 --> 41:01.036
Oh, I find that
hard to believe.

41:01.670 --> 41:03.472
It's true. No one wants me.

41:03.505 --> 41:05.040
I find that
even harder to believe.

41:06.909 --> 41:09.211
Truth is, I get bored easy.

41:09.244 --> 41:11.714
Yeah. The old boredom.

41:11.747 --> 41:14.149
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Sets in, doesn't it?

41:14.183 --> 41:15.984
Life's too short
for just one cock.

41:16.552 --> 41:17.686
What?

41:19.388 --> 41:20.756
I mean, what...

41:20.789 --> 41:22.758
What if it's, uh...
What if it's great, a great cock?

41:22.791 --> 41:24.393
What's your definition
of a great cock?

41:25.794 --> 41:27.029
I don't know.

41:28.530 --> 41:30.032
A long, wide...

41:31.200 --> 41:34.103
girthy one, you know,
a nice one. That's nice.

41:34.136 --> 41:36.305
- Is that what yours is like?
- Mine?

41:36.338 --> 41:37.740
- Yeah.
- Uh...

41:37.773 --> 41:40.209
I mean, mine's like okay,
I suppose.

41:40.242 --> 41:41.677
- Show me.
- What?

41:41.977 --> 41:43.379
Show me.

41:43.412 --> 41:44.980
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on.

41:45.013 --> 41:46.548
I promise
I'm not gonna touch it.

41:46.582 --> 41:48.083
I know, but...

41:48.117 --> 41:49.852
I've got a girlfriend.

41:49.885 --> 41:51.286
One who punches you
in the face.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.254
Only the once.

41:52.287 --> 41:53.655
Do you wanna fuck me, Chris?

41:54.390 --> 41:55.224
Ooh.

41:57.393 --> 42:00.295
It's a nice... Nice thing
to say, isn't it? But, uh...

42:01.497 --> 42:03.866
You know, I'm sure
that'd be lovely. Very...

42:04.867 --> 42:08.871
extravagant, yeah.
Excellent night's work.

42:09.405 --> 42:10.806
And nice fun, but...

42:10.839 --> 42:12.107
You know,
it's just I've got...

42:12.141 --> 42:13.542
I wasn't offering.

42:13.575 --> 42:15.677
I'm simply asking if it's
something that you'd want to do.

42:15.711 --> 42:17.246
Oh, right, yes.

42:17.279 --> 42:19.915
Yeah. It's more of an offer
not on the table, but...

42:21.383 --> 42:22.251
Chris!

42:27.689 --> 42:29.825
Ooh, ooh.

42:29.858 --> 42:32.961
- Fuck. What the fuck, Chris?
- What the fuck, Chris!

42:33.395 --> 42:34.596
Oh, my God!

42:34.630 --> 42:36.265
"Oh, my God,
I'm so fucking cute.

42:36.298 --> 42:39.501
"I've got really pointy nipples
and I'm so fucking cute." Chris!

42:39.535 --> 42:41.837
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

42:42.438 --> 42:43.439
Fuck.

42:43.472 --> 42:45.207
That's it. That's it.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.508
Can't do this anymore.

42:46.542 --> 42:47.609
Oh, my God,
I need to get of here.

42:47.643 --> 42:49.378
Get me out
of this fucking game!

42:50.813 --> 42:52.214
Shit, shit, shit.

42:58.554 --> 43:00.756
Oh, my God.

43:04.693 --> 43:05.994
Lucy!

43:06.528 --> 43:07.763
- Lucy.
- Fuck off!

43:07.796 --> 43:09.431
You'll never believe
what just happened.

43:09.465 --> 43:11.266
I threw up on the stairs.

43:11.300 --> 43:12.534
Do you think I should
tell someone about that?

43:12.568 --> 43:14.002
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

43:14.036 --> 43:16.171
I don't know. I think I'm just
not as fit as I used to be.

43:16.205 --> 43:17.941
My chest hurts.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.508
- Think I should sit down a bit.
- No!

43:19.541 --> 43:20.709
I'm not talking
about that, Chris.

43:20.742 --> 43:21.777
You kissed another girl!

43:21.810 --> 43:22.744
I didn't, though.

43:22.778 --> 43:24.413
You did!
I just fucking saw you!

43:24.446 --> 43:25.581
I just saw you.

43:25.614 --> 43:26.748
She kissed me.

43:26.782 --> 43:28.383
I had nothing
to do with it.

43:28.417 --> 43:31.019
A... Americans are strong,
aren't they? Like...

43:31.053 --> 43:33.455
No, it wasn't your fault,
was it? It never is!

43:33.489 --> 43:35.023
- What do you mean?
- I mean, Chris,

43:35.057 --> 43:37.493
you never take responsibility
for anything.

43:37.526 --> 43:38.760
You just bumble through life.

43:38.794 --> 43:40.462
"I'm Chris.
I'm really funny.

43:40.496 --> 43:42.431
"And nothing
is ever my fault."

43:42.464 --> 43:44.166
When the fuck are you
going to grow up?

43:45.434 --> 43:46.835
I said I'm sorry.

43:50.072 --> 43:51.173
That's just it.

43:52.641 --> 43:54.076
You haven't...

43:54.109 --> 43:56.211
You haven't said you're sorry,
not once.

43:57.579 --> 43:58.647
And you know what?

43:58.680 --> 44:00.215
I don't think I want to
do this anymore.

44:00.749 --> 44:01.985
I think I'm done.

44:04.419 --> 44:05.687
I'm done.

44:06.421 --> 44:07.256
Done?

44:07.723 --> 44:09.091
- Yeah.
- What...

44:09.124 --> 44:09.893
What does "done" mean?

44:09.926 --> 44:11.860
It means I'm done.

44:11.895 --> 44:14.263
Done. Done.
Done. Done.

44:15.430 --> 44:16.632
Done.

Hi.

45:57.666 --> 45:58.901
What I get you?

45:58.935 --> 46:00.869
- Just a Coke, please.
<i>- Bene.</i>

46:00.903 --> 46:01.737
Thanks.

46:04.539 --> 46:05.774
Just stick with
the sausage, Chris.

46:05.807 --> 46:07.643
Stick with the sausage
and chips.

46:16.085 --> 46:17.152
Hey.

46:17.185 --> 46:18.420
I'm Adriana.

46:18.955 --> 46:20.123
Lucy.

46:20.155 --> 46:21.657
What the fuck is that?

46:25.360 --> 46:26.461
Looks like some sort of...

46:27.362 --> 46:28.797
pregnancy test, isn't it?

46:32.200 --> 46:34.070
Oh, well.

46:35.170 --> 46:36.304
No.

46:45.982 --> 46:47.616
It's all in fucking Italian.

46:47.649 --> 46:48.784
<i>So,
what happened then?</i>

46:49.451 --> 46:50.452
What?

46:50.485 --> 46:53.089
How come you're in a bar
all on your own?

46:54.256 --> 46:56.458
Uh, I had an argument
with my boyfriend.

46:56.491 --> 46:57.426
About what?

46:57.994 --> 46:59.361
He kissed another girl.

46:59.394 --> 47:00.629
I mean, he...

47:00.662 --> 47:02.131
He said that
she kissed him,

47:02.165 --> 47:03.832
and therefore,
it wasn't his fault.

47:03.865 --> 47:05.600
And you don't believe him?

47:05.634 --> 47:07.369
Well I mean,
she was really hot.

47:07.402 --> 47:08.403
So?

47:08.437 --> 47:10.572
So it literally took him
about six months

47:10.605 --> 47:12.374
to build up the courage
to kiss me.

47:12.407 --> 47:14.010
He's known this girl for...

47:14.643 --> 47:15.777
six seconds?

47:15.811 --> 47:16.879
And he could've stopped it?

47:16.913 --> 47:19.015
Um, yes,
he could've stopped it.

47:19.048 --> 47:20.816
What? It's not
that hard, is it?

47:28.557 --> 47:30.026
Okay.

47:30.059 --> 47:32.861
So, you were
supposed to stop me.

47:33.662 --> 47:35.131
Okay.

47:35.630 --> 47:37.866
Well, cool. Sorry.

47:37.900 --> 47:40.103
So, he could be
telling the truth.

47:40.136 --> 47:41.904
I mean, yeah.

47:41.938 --> 47:43.672
Yeah, I guess he could be.

48:02.992 --> 48:03.759
Oh, my...

48:03.792 --> 48:05.061
Well, I mean,

48:05.094 --> 48:06.828
that's not the only thing
that fucks me off about him.

48:06.862 --> 48:09.098
Okay. So, tell me.

48:09.132 --> 48:12.101
Um, well, he is...

48:12.135 --> 48:13.468
He's very childish.

48:13.502 --> 48:17.372
Um, I mean, like,
extremely childish.

48:17.405 --> 48:18.774
And he's just,

48:18.807 --> 48:21.177
he's got no...
no passion for anything,

48:21.210 --> 48:22.677
no drive at all.

48:22.711 --> 48:24.947
He doesn't smoke but
he definitely drinks too much

48:24.981 --> 48:27.016
and he masturbates a lot.

48:27.049 --> 48:28.850
Yeah, it's weird.

48:28.885 --> 48:32.021
And what do you
love about him?

48:35.323 --> 48:37.692
Well...

48:40.695 --> 48:41.931
Um...

48:43.632 --> 48:45.902
Okay. So it shouldn't be
taking this long.

48:45.935 --> 48:48.403
No, I know. I know.

48:48.436 --> 48:49.906
But there is stuff.

48:49.939 --> 48:52.175
- Obviously there is stuff.
- Stuff?

48:52.208 --> 48:53.242
You use the word "stuff"

48:53.276 --> 48:55.377
to describe the man
you're in love with?

48:58.948 --> 49:00.849
Yeah, that's not good,
is it?

49:03.119 --> 49:06.055
<i>So, what are you
going to do now, then?</i>

49:06.088 --> 49:09.292
<i>Um... I think
I'll just go home.</i>

49:09.825 --> 49:11.127
Where's home?

49:11.160 --> 49:12.494
- London.
- London?

49:12.527 --> 49:13.562
I live in London.

49:13.595 --> 49:15.231
I'm currently
on a placement year here.

49:15.264 --> 49:17.967
Oh, my God, it's such a small
world, isn't it?

49:18.867 --> 49:20.435
Well, what were you doing here?

49:20.468 --> 49:21.503
We were supposed to be

49:21.536 --> 49:23.672
on a 10-day trip
around Europe.

49:23.705 --> 49:25.774
So, why would you
go home then?

49:25.807 --> 49:27.977
That's the last thing
you should do.

49:28.476 --> 49:29.477
Why?

49:29.511 --> 49:31.546
You don't need him to

49:31.580 --> 49:32.882
go to a coffee shop with

49:32.915 --> 49:34.583
or go to a museum with

49:34.616 --> 49:37.419
or him buy you a bus ticket.

49:37.452 --> 49:39.788
You have so much
to think about.

49:40.488 --> 49:41.991
You can do it on your own.

49:47.296 --> 49:48.763
Yeah. I don't know.

49:49.865 --> 49:52.101
Where's next
on the adventure?

49:52.134 --> 49:55.570
Um, I'm supposed to get a 10:00 a.m.
train to Venice.

49:55.604 --> 49:56.872
<i>I have a friend in Venice</i>

49:56.906 --> 49:58.373
<i>who you can
totally crash with.</i>

49:58.406 --> 49:59.275
<i>Adriana.</i>

49:59.308 --> 50:00.675
<i>She'd be
happy to have you.</i>

50:00.709 --> 50:01.776
<i>Do you have a pen and paper?</i>

50:01.810 --> 50:03.745
<i>You really
don't have to do that.</i>

50:03.778 --> 50:04.881
<i>She's called Mia.</i>

50:04.914 --> 50:07.049
And she's amazing.

50:07.083 --> 50:08.951
And she can show you
the real Venice.

50:08.985 --> 50:10.987
You can just
crash on her sofa.

50:11.020 --> 50:13.055
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

50:13.089 --> 50:14.556
Honestly, you don't
have to do that.

50:14.589 --> 50:16.225
But thank you very much.

50:17.859 --> 50:19.728
So, what are you
going to do now?

50:21.130 --> 50:23.299
Probably just
get another hostel.

50:23.332 --> 50:24.666
You can stay with me. Yeah.

50:24.699 --> 50:25.667
Oh, my God!

50:25.700 --> 50:28.436
- No, I live five minutes away.
- Really?

50:28.470 --> 50:30.006
And it's really
simple and basic

50:30.039 --> 50:33.175
but it's home
and I'd love to have you.

50:33.209 --> 50:34.944
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- I insist.</i>

50:35.810 --> 50:36.678
<i>Drink up.</i>

51:08.244 --> 51:09.711
<i>Carbonara.</i>

51:09.744 --> 51:10.679
Ciao.

51:10.712 --> 51:12.348
Buzzing in here, innit?

51:12.381 --> 51:13.082
What I get you?

51:13.115 --> 51:15.351
Oh, I'll have a beer, please.

51:20.789 --> 51:23.159
It's four euro.

51:25.660 --> 51:26.494

51:27.696 --> 51:29.131
- Okay.

54:17.366 --> 54:18.300
Yes.

54:18.334 --> 54:19.935
Could you, uh, say
goodbye to her for me?

54:19.969 --> 54:21.769
Of course.
She's my girlfriend.

54:23.038 --> 54:23.872
Come again.

54:23.906 --> 54:25.374
She's my girlfriend.

54:26.808 --> 54:27.910
Good luck with that.

54:27.943 --> 54:29.777
- Oh, do you have the time?
- Yeah.

54:31.313 --> 54:32.847
- 9:50.
- 9:50?

54:32.882 --> 54:35.451
- 9:50. Yes.
- As in 10 to 10?

54:35.484 --> 54:36.886
- Yes.
- Shit!

55:16.592 --> 55:18.060
Not even bloody close.

- Yep.

56:58.894 --> 56:59.962
Potent, isn't it?

56:59.995 --> 57:01.430
Really stings the old nostrils.

57:01.463 --> 57:03.732
- Uh, I've smelled worse.
- Lovely.

57:03.766 --> 57:04.767
Um...

57:05.668 --> 57:06.935
You haven't seen this girl,
have you?

57:07.835 --> 57:09.238
No, I'm afraid not.

57:09.271 --> 57:10.939
Okay. No worries.

57:10.973 --> 57:12.341
Would you like a room?

57:13.442 --> 57:15.377
- I'm good, thanks. See you later, mate.
- Okay.

57:36.065 --> 57:38.334
Here you go.
Decaf.

57:39.268 --> 57:40.235
Thanks.

57:41.036 --> 57:42.037
You okay?

57:42.938 --> 57:44.173
Yeah, I'm fine.

57:45.007 --> 57:46.909
You know, it's okay
not to be okay.

57:49.912 --> 57:52.948
So, I'm in Venice.

57:54.149 --> 57:56.085
Decided to have a little
go on a gondolier.

57:57.353 --> 57:58.354
It's good.

57:59.355 --> 58:00.489
Come meet me mate here.

58:03.359 --> 58:04.460
It's not what his name is.

58:06.929 --> 58:09.732
<i>- Buongiorno!

58:09.765 --> 58:12.134

58:18.640 --> 58:20.042

58:20.075 --> 58:22.077
"Plenty more fish in the sea."

58:23.212 --> 58:25.748
Yeah, that is...
That is what they say.

58:26.648 --> 58:29.785
<i>♪ I'm here in Venice</i>

58:29.818 --> 58:32.588

58:40.095 --> 58:41.597
we're going to go dancing.

58:41.630 --> 58:44.266
- I've got nothing to wear.
- It's fine.

58:44.299 --> 58:45.801
I know the perfect place.

59:16.532 --> 59:17.533
Sorry...

59:20.469 --> 59:22.471
Okay. I'm going to go.
I'll go.

59:22.504 --> 59:24.173
Bye. Friendly here, aren't they?

1:00:01.777 --> 1:00:02.778
Hello, old lady.

1:00:07.316 --> 1:00:08.450
It's hot, innit?

1:00:09.618 --> 1:00:11.253
I don't do that well
in the heat.

1:00:12.221 --> 1:00:13.388
Or the cold.

1:00:14.690 --> 1:00:16.091
That's why
I got an ice cream.

1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:18.727
And a sweater in me bag.

1:00:19.728 --> 1:00:21.096
Good work with the coat.

1:00:21.129 --> 1:00:22.464
Good move, smart.

1:00:24.934 --> 1:00:27.436
You don't have anywhere to
stay, do you, around here?

1:00:27.469 --> 1:00:29.671
It's just, the last place
I was at was, um...

1:00:29.705 --> 1:00:30.940
Well, it wasn't very nice.

1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:33.809
There was a big shit
on the floor.

1:00:34.911 --> 1:00:37.012
It was like a French stick.

1:00:37.045 --> 1:00:38.882
I haven't
seen anything like it.

1:00:40.015 --> 1:00:41.985
I've had a pretty shitty
couple of days.

1:00:43.151 --> 1:00:44.820
Found out
my girlfriend's pregnant.

1:00:45.721 --> 1:00:46.956
That's amazing.

1:00:47.856 --> 1:00:49.893
It's pretty good news.

1:00:49.926 --> 1:00:51.493
Then she caught me
kissing another girl

1:00:51.527 --> 1:00:52.962
and ran off.

1:00:53.897 --> 1:00:54.863
Well, I wasn't
kissing another girl,

1:00:54.898 --> 1:00:56.265
she was kissing me,

1:00:56.865 --> 1:00:59.134
but she doesn't know that.

1:00:59.167 --> 1:01:02.271
So, I'm pretty much just wandering
around Venice like a prick.

1:01:03.505 --> 1:01:05.140
She's beautiful, my Lucy.

1:01:06.608 --> 1:01:07.809
She's amazing.

1:01:09.111 --> 1:01:12.514
Like you... You were probably
beautiful when you were younger.

1:01:12.548 --> 1:01:14.816
You're still all right now,
you know.

1:01:19.154 --> 1:01:20.890
I know I'm not much
to look at.

1:01:21.757 --> 1:01:23.525
But I'm funny.

1:01:23.559 --> 1:01:25.627
I've got pretty
good-sized penis,

1:01:25.661 --> 1:01:27.296
medium-sized.

1:01:28.697 --> 1:01:29.865
You'll never know, though.

1:01:31.968 --> 1:01:35.939
Yeah, so that's me,
just wandering around Venice.

1:01:35.972 --> 1:01:38.440
Let me know if you fancy doing
anything later 'cause

1:01:38.473 --> 1:01:39.976
I'm at a loose end.

1:01:41.176 --> 1:01:45.514
Probably go out,
dinner, dance, you know.

1:01:47.050 --> 1:01:49.451
All right, well,
it's been nice chatting.

1:01:50.485 --> 1:01:51.853
I love a good chat.

1:01:53.689 --> 1:01:55.223
So I'll get off now.

1:01:55.257 --> 1:01:56.358
See you later, old lady.

1:02:37.532 --> 1:02:38.533
Mia!

1:03:18.975 --> 1:03:21.176
- I think he fancies you.
- Oh, my God, Mia!

1:03:21.209 --> 1:03:22.277
He doesn't fancy me.

1:03:22.310 --> 1:03:23.779
- I think he fancies you.
- He doesn't. He fancies you.

1:03:23.812 --> 1:03:25.982
Everyone fucking fancies you. You're kidding me.

1:03:26.015 --> 1:03:28.784
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

1:03:32.688 --> 1:03:33.890
Hello.

1:03:40.163 --> 1:03:44.433
This is Chris and Lucy's
trip to Europe.

1:03:46.368 --> 1:03:47.469
Here's Chris.

1:03:49.538 --> 1:03:51.406
It's not Lucy, is it?

1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:53.109
No, it's a big fucking bag,

1:03:55.610 --> 1:03:57.312
not Lucy.

1:03:57.345 --> 1:03:59.182
Do you know where she is?

1:03:59.214 --> 1:04:01.516
Do you know why
I don't know where she is?

1:04:01.550 --> 1:04:03.852
'Cause she fucked off.

1:04:04.519 --> 1:04:05.821
Walked off,

1:04:06.488 --> 1:04:10.358
because... because of me.

1:04:15.363 --> 1:04:18.000
Because of how I behave.

1:04:18.034 --> 1:04:20.469
Because I don't think.

1:04:24.673 --> 1:04:25.707
I don't...

1:04:25.741 --> 1:04:27.509
I don't think
about her enough.

1:04:28.510 --> 1:04:30.113
But all she does
is think about me.

1:04:33.815 --> 1:04:36.919
So, you stayed here
even though he left you?

1:04:36.953 --> 1:04:39.956
Hell, yeah. This is my home.

1:04:39.989 --> 1:04:42.024
Not just gonna run away.
Fuck that.

1:04:43.126 --> 1:04:44.894
Yeah, but weren't you scared?

1:04:45.827 --> 1:04:48.330
Oh, my God. Terrified.

1:04:49.598 --> 1:04:52.300
But that's how I knew I was
doing the right thing.

1:04:54.836 --> 1:04:57.272
If you're not
living on the edge

1:04:58.340 --> 1:05:00.475
then you're taking up
too much space.

1:05:02.744 --> 1:05:05.547
I mean, I'm not saying that's how
everyone should live their lives

1:05:05.580 --> 1:05:07.917
but it worked for me.

1:05:10.019 --> 1:05:11.853
I'm a fucking wanker.

1:05:12.955 --> 1:05:14.322
I don't even see it.

1:05:15.724 --> 1:05:18.094
I walked
around in Venice.

1:05:19.461 --> 1:05:21.063
I went on a gondolier.

1:05:21.097 --> 1:05:24.299
Only it's not a gondolier,
it's called a gondola.

1:05:25.101 --> 1:05:26.668
And I know
it's called a gondola

1:05:26.701 --> 1:05:28.905
but I say gondolier

1:05:28.938 --> 1:05:30.539
'cause I think
it'll make her laugh.

1:05:30.572 --> 1:05:32.175
And it does.

1:05:32.208 --> 1:05:33.842
'Cause I do all the
other stuff.

1:05:34.676 --> 1:05:36.511
I don't say,
I don't...

1:05:36.545 --> 1:05:38.047
Doesn't make
her laugh.

1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:41.284
I don't... think.

1:05:45.787 --> 1:05:47.455
So I went on it
on my own.

1:05:47.489 --> 1:05:50.826
I sat next to an old lady
on a bench on my own.

1:05:50.859 --> 1:05:53.595
And she was lovely.

1:05:55.898 --> 1:05:58.100
Couldn't understand
a fucking work I was saying.

1:06:00.136 --> 1:06:01.803
But Lucy
does understand...

1:06:02.337 --> 1:06:04.539
the words I say.

1:06:04.573 --> 1:06:06.608
That's why I should
think what I say

1:06:06.641 --> 1:06:08.211
before I say it.

1:06:10.445 --> 1:06:13.015
I couldn't be more terrified
right now if I tried.

1:06:13.815 --> 1:06:15.717
Fuck him,
he's a dick...

1:06:15.750 --> 1:06:17.119
I'm pregnant.

1:06:17.719 --> 1:06:18.553
So...

1:06:21.523 --> 1:06:22.892
there's that.

1:06:22.925 --> 1:06:24.426
Let me ask you
a question.

1:06:26.262 --> 1:06:27.429
Do you love him?

1:06:33.269 --> 1:06:34.337
Yeah.

1:06:35.570 --> 1:06:37.039
Fucking hell.
Look at the rain.

1:06:39.208 --> 1:06:41.143
I deserve this,
I deserve to be...

1:06:42.912 --> 1:06:44.247
out in the rain...

1:06:45.447 --> 1:06:46.949
on my own.

1:06:46.983 --> 1:06:49.151
And she deserves
to be in somewhere...

1:06:50.052 --> 1:06:52.420
nice,
with nice people.

1:06:55.291 --> 1:06:57.026
But we're meant to be.

1:06:57.059 --> 1:07:00.528
You know,
when canals go

1:07:00.562 --> 1:07:03.632
in Venice,
go to places.

1:07:03.665 --> 1:07:05.734
We're supposed
to go to a place.

1:07:05.767 --> 1:07:07.535
So I'm gonna go
on a canal tomorrow

1:07:07.569 --> 1:07:08.803
and find her.

1:07:12.807 --> 1:07:15.378
And also I'll behave,

1:07:15.410 --> 1:07:16.511
and say sorry.

1:07:19.547 --> 1:07:20.983
And I'll call it a gondola.

1:07:26.923 --> 1:07:29.892
Lucy... I'll see you
tomorrow.

1:07:31.060 --> 1:07:32.061
Bye.

1:08:36.192 --> 1:08:37.159
Excuse me.

1:08:38.928 --> 1:08:42.398
Um, you haven't seen
this girl, have you?

1:08:45.001 --> 1:08:45.968
No.

1:08:47.036 --> 1:08:48.471
But you're not
really looking.

1:08:48.503 --> 1:08:50.538
- No.
- No?

1:08:51.706 --> 1:08:54.410
- No.
- No?

1:08:54.776 --> 1:08:55.777
No.

1:08:56.879 --> 1:08:58.247
It's nice, this place,
isn't it?

1:09:00.582 --> 1:09:01.917
Got you there,
didn't I?

1:09:12.395 --> 1:09:13.362
Excuse me.

1:09:18.833 --> 1:09:20.869
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:09:21.203 --> 1:09:22.038
Um...

1:09:23.072 --> 1:09:24.507
You haven't seen
this girl, have you?

1:09:24.539 --> 1:09:26.142
Is she
staying here?

1:09:30.146 --> 1:09:31.414
No.

1:09:32.781 --> 1:09:34.083
Are you sure?

1:09:35.750 --> 1:09:37.953
Yes, I'm sure.
I'm sorry, mate.

1:09:37.987 --> 1:09:40.489
Aw.
That's all right, mate.

1:09:40.523 --> 1:09:42.058
- Have a good day.
- You too.

1:10:02.777 --> 1:10:04.113
- Hi.
- Hello.

1:10:04.146 --> 1:10:05.847
Um, I'd like
a room please.

1:10:07.416 --> 1:10:09.518
I've seen
you before.

1:10:10.352 --> 1:10:12.188
Do we know
each other?

1:10:12.221 --> 1:10:14.890
I'm not sure,
but I've seen you before.

1:10:14.924 --> 1:10:16.724
On a...
on a film.

1:10:17.759 --> 1:10:18.793
I'm not
an actress.

1:10:18.827 --> 1:10:20.096
Um...

1:10:20.129 --> 1:10:22.730
Can I just
get a room, please?

1:10:22.764 --> 1:10:24.133
Certainly.

1:11:49.218 --> 1:11:51.086
Helloo!

1:11:51.753 --> 1:11:53.222
Helloo!

1:12:05.733 --> 1:12:06.969
Hello.

1:12:07.002 --> 1:12:08.938
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

1:12:09.905 --> 1:12:11.773
Yes, you can.

1:12:11.806 --> 1:12:14.043
I'd like a room, please.

1:12:14.076 --> 1:12:15.644
- Oh, fine...
- Tala-ba-da-da.

1:12:16.912 --> 1:12:18.180
Before you ask...

1:12:21.951 --> 1:12:23.552
Mmm-hmm

1:12:23.586 --> 1:12:25.087
This ain't my first rodeo.

1:12:25.888 --> 1:12:28.190
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:32.561
Zom-zom.

1:12:32.595 --> 1:12:35.231
Can I...
can I just say...

1:12:35.264 --> 1:12:37.832
that you have
beautiful eyes.

1:12:38.267 --> 1:12:39.468
Both of them.

1:12:40.369 --> 1:12:42.304
Contacts?

1:12:43.172 --> 1:12:45.074
- No.
- Amazing.

1:12:46.175 --> 1:12:48.477
So, how much
is it for the old?

1:12:48.510 --> 1:12:51.146
So, that'll be 69 euro.

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:53.282
Stone the fucking
crows, mate.

1:12:53.649 --> 1:12:54.917
'Struth!

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:57.852
I want a room,
not the building.

1:12:57.886 --> 1:12:59.488
Would you like
the room or not?

1:12:59.854 --> 1:13:01.624
Yeah, I do.

1:13:01.657 --> 1:13:03.959
- Fine.
- I was just being funny.

1:13:03.993 --> 1:13:06.128
- So...
- There you go old girl.

1:13:06.161 --> 1:13:08.631
Count it out,
old bean.

1:13:08.664 --> 1:13:10.832
There you go, mate.

1:13:10.865 --> 1:13:13.135
- Thank you very much...
- Keep the fucking change.

1:13:13.168 --> 1:13:16.572
That's um...
room 11, 3rd floor.

1:13:22.344 --> 1:13:24.480
Good evening.
Have a good night's sleep.

1:13:24.513 --> 1:13:26.448
- Good night.
- You'll need it.

1:13:27.316 --> 1:13:28.450
I love you.

1:13:57.246 --> 1:13:58.080
What's that?

1:13:58.813 --> 1:13:59.814
Ah!

1:14:00.316 --> 1:14:01.984
What the fuck?

1:14:03.818 --> 1:14:04.920
Ah, shit!

1:14:07.423 --> 1:14:08.590
Whose that?

1:14:08.624 --> 1:14:09.857
Whose that?

1:14:10.959 --> 1:14:13.128
I'm on a merry go round
and I don't like it.

1:15:03.645 --> 1:15:05.748
- Oh, good morning.
- Morning.

1:15:05.781 --> 1:15:07.516
- Did you have a good stay?
- I did, yeah.

1:15:07.549 --> 1:15:09.985
There was a very loud guy
this morning, though.

1:15:10.018 --> 1:15:11.887
Oh, I think I know
who you mean.

1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:13.522
I hope he wasn't too much
of a nuisance.

1:15:13.555 --> 1:15:14.356
Just drunk, was he?

1:15:14.390 --> 1:15:16.892
Yeah. Bit of a
flirt too, actually.

1:15:16.925 --> 1:15:18.727
- Brilliant.
- Harmless enough, though.

1:15:18.761 --> 1:15:20.596
I think he had
a rough day.

1:15:20.629 --> 1:15:22.631
Ah, yeah.
I know the feeling.

1:15:22.664 --> 1:15:24.233
Is there anything
I can help you with?

1:15:24.266 --> 1:15:27.102
Can you tell me the way
to the Piazza Della Liberta?

1:15:27.136 --> 1:15:30.172
Sure. Um, at the door
turn left

1:15:30.205 --> 1:15:31.907
and at the end
of the street turn right

1:15:31.940 --> 1:15:33.409
and it's about
four blocks away.

1:15:33.442 --> 1:15:35.511
- Okay, perfect. Thank you.
- Okay. You have a great day.

1:15:35.544 --> 1:15:37.179
- You too, Ciao.
- Bye.

1:15:58.801 --> 1:16:00.102
Excuse me.

1:16:02.404 --> 1:16:03.907
Excuse me!

1:16:04.706 --> 1:16:07.242
- Ah, good morning.
- Good morning.

1:16:07.276 --> 1:16:08.677
How are you
this morning?

1:16:08.710 --> 1:16:11.680
Um, well I feel my
head's gonna explode.

1:16:11.713 --> 1:16:13.015
Other than that,
great thanks.

1:16:13.048 --> 1:16:14.716
But you found
your girl, though?

1:16:14.750 --> 1:16:16.385
- What?
- You found her?

1:16:16.418 --> 1:16:18.387
The girl in the film.
You found her?

1:16:18.420 --> 1:16:22.691
No. I've pretty much checked
every hostel in Florence.

1:16:22.724 --> 1:16:23.759
No luck.

1:16:23.792 --> 1:16:25.994
- She was here at breakfast.
- What?

1:16:26.028 --> 1:16:27.563
At breakfast
I saw her.

1:16:27.596 --> 1:16:28.864
- At breakfast?
- Yes.

1:16:28.898 --> 1:16:29.832
- Here?
- Yes.

1:16:29.865 --> 1:16:31.800
- Is she still here?
- I think so.

1:16:31.834 --> 1:16:33.302
Uh, I will
just check.

1:16:33.335 --> 1:16:35.871
Emma, could you help
this gentleman, please?

1:16:36.738 --> 1:16:38.173
My girl, you saw my girl?

1:16:38.207 --> 1:16:40.342
- Um, the pretty one?
- Yes, the pretty one.

1:16:40.375 --> 1:16:41.844
- My Lucy.
- She's your girlfriend?

1:16:41.878 --> 1:16:42.946
Yes, all right,
I know I'm punching

1:16:42.978 --> 1:16:43.979
but where...
where is she?

1:16:44.012 --> 1:16:45.314
She left
five minutes ago.

1:16:45.347 --> 1:16:46.448
Where did she go?

1:16:46.482 --> 1:16:48.150
Piazza Della Liberta.

1:16:48.984 --> 1:16:49.852
How do I get there?

1:16:49.886 --> 1:16:51.320
Walk out, turn left,

1:16:51.353 --> 1:16:52.922
at the end of the street,
turn right

1:16:52.956 --> 1:16:54.790
and then it's about
four blocks from there.

1:16:54.823 --> 1:16:56.458
- You better hurry, though.
- Thank you.

1:16:57.961 --> 1:16:59.461
Don't lose her, mate.

1:18:29.919 --> 1:18:31.320
How did you find me?

1:18:32.754 --> 1:18:34.323
We were staying
at the same hostel.

1:18:35.390 --> 1:18:36.926
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:18:38.627 --> 1:18:40.029
Oh, my God!

1:18:40.063 --> 1:18:41.797
You were the drunk guy
from last night.

1:18:41.830 --> 1:18:43.599
Guilty.

1:18:43.632 --> 1:18:45.467
You were the drunk
guy who flirted

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:47.202
with the receptionist,
again.

1:18:47.235 --> 1:18:49.104
That hag?
Not my cup of tea.

1:18:49.137 --> 1:18:51.306
No. She's really
not your type, is she?

1:18:51.340 --> 1:18:53.175
Look, you're my type.

1:18:54.810 --> 1:18:56.612
Do you want to kneel down
or shall I get up?

1:18:57.546 --> 1:18:58.948
What do you think?

1:18:59.481 --> 1:19:00.549
I'll get up.

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:06.990
Oh!

1:19:10.726 --> 1:19:12.194
I don't want
to let go.

1:19:13.997 --> 1:19:15.497
You might
run off again.

1:19:20.003 --> 1:19:21.837
You're not gonna
run off, are you?

1:19:30.846 --> 1:19:32.347
I've been thinking.

1:19:34.216 --> 1:19:36.284
I'm sorry for acting
like such a...

1:19:37.319 --> 1:19:39.122
A twat.

1:19:39.154 --> 1:19:40.455
What's twat
in Italian?

1:19:41.523 --> 1:19:42.357
Twat.

1:19:43.158 --> 1:19:44.159
Is it?

1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:48.563
So, um...
I've been everywhere.

1:19:50.432 --> 1:19:51.533
On my own.

1:19:52.401 --> 1:19:53.535
But I brought me bag.

1:19:55.537 --> 1:19:57.073
- How is your bag?
- It's fine.

1:19:57.773 --> 1:19:59.108
Nice. Good.

1:20:00.809 --> 1:20:02.210
How you've been?

1:20:03.178 --> 1:20:04.212
Been okay.

1:20:05.114 --> 1:20:06.548
You look
like you have.

1:20:07.349 --> 1:20:08.985
Me.

1:20:10.153 --> 1:20:12.421
Made friends
with a little old lady.

1:20:12.454 --> 1:20:13.689
Had a good old chat.

1:20:13.722 --> 1:20:15.490
Told her
all about you.

1:20:16.591 --> 1:20:18.027
She was nice.

1:20:18.794 --> 1:20:20.495
Had a ride on a gondolier.

1:20:21.663 --> 1:20:23.032
Sing a song with a guy.

1:20:24.399 --> 1:20:25.834
Ate a couple of pizzas.

1:20:28.537 --> 1:20:30.106
Jesus Christ!
Listen to me.

1:20:31.807 --> 1:20:33.608
Me, me, me.

1:20:35.544 --> 1:20:36.578
I'm sorry.

1:20:39.481 --> 1:20:40.983
I'm sorry I'm such an idiot.

1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:46.388
Yeah.

1:20:48.891 --> 1:20:50.325
But you're my idiot.

1:20:52.828 --> 1:20:54.296
Am I?

1:20:56.231 --> 1:20:57.232
Yeah.

1:20:58.901 --> 1:21:00.469
And look, we...

1:21:00.502 --> 1:21:02.838
Neither of us should be
doing this on our own.

1:21:04.406 --> 1:21:05.841
This trip was meant
to be about...

1:21:05.874 --> 1:21:07.275
You haven't been
on your own, though.

1:21:08.443 --> 1:21:09.478
What?

1:21:10.312 --> 1:21:12.447
I found
the pregnancy test.

1:21:13.916 --> 1:21:15.151
It was yours, wasn't it?

1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:17.954
Yeah.

1:21:19.554 --> 1:21:20.756
Yeah, it's mine.

1:21:20.789 --> 1:21:22.125
Holy shit!

1:21:23.092 --> 1:21:26.162
Does that mean we
gonna be, like, parents?

1:21:26.195 --> 1:21:28.396
- Yeah.
- Proper adults.

1:21:29.232 --> 1:21:30.133
Yup.

1:21:30.166 --> 1:21:31.633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:21:31.666 --> 1:21:33.435
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:21:33.468 --> 1:21:34.971
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:21:37.806 --> 1:21:39.708
Oh, sorry.

1:21:39.741 --> 1:21:40.977
Watch out.

1:21:41.010 --> 1:21:42.879
Chris, it's literally
like a raisin right now.

1:21:42.912 --> 1:21:45.148
I know, but I sat
on a raisin once.

1:21:46.249 --> 1:21:47.884
And I'm gonna
protect that raisin.

1:21:50.119 --> 1:21:52.821
I'm gonna start tucking
my shirts in.

1:21:52.854 --> 1:21:55.323
- Brilliant.
- Well, it is.

1:21:56.625 --> 1:21:58.493
I want to be
a good dad.

1:21:58.527 --> 1:22:00.796
That's what
good dads do.

1:22:00.829 --> 1:22:02.864
I know you don't
believe that now, but...

1:22:02.899 --> 1:22:04.466
- There's two of...
- No. I do.

1:22:05.767 --> 1:22:07.003
I believe that.

1:22:07.502 --> 1:22:09.738
- You do?
- Yeah.

1:22:09.771 --> 1:22:11.974
Of course I do.
Come here.

1:22:21.184 --> 1:22:22.484
Sorry I'm such a dick.

1:22:22.517 --> 1:22:25.087
Oh!
It's okay.

1:22:25.121 --> 1:22:27.622
It's not okay.
It's not okay.

1:22:29.391 --> 1:22:33.196
It's not okay to be a dick
to something so good.

1:22:36.165 --> 1:22:38.567
My dick days are over.

1:22:39.768 --> 1:22:41.336
Maybe let's work
on that. Shall we?

1:22:43.906 --> 1:22:45.407
So what do we do now?

1:22:49.811 --> 1:22:51.214
Let's just make tracks.

1:22:52.848 --> 1:22:54.917
What? What does that mean?

1:22:55.617 --> 1:22:57.920
You know,
let's make tracks.

1:22:57.954 --> 1:22:59.322
I've never heard
that before.

1:22:59.354 --> 1:23:00.388
Of course you have.

1:23:00.422 --> 1:23:02.490
I've literally never heard
anyone say that, ever.

1:23:02.524 --> 1:23:03.926
Well, it's a saying, isn't it?

1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:07.163
No. Let's make like sheep
and get the flock out of here.

1:23:07.196 --> 1:23:09.065
- That's a saying.
- Okay.

1:23:09.098 --> 1:23:10.266
Let's mate
like a tampon

1:23:10.299 --> 1:23:11.334
and get out
of this bloody hole...

1:23:11.366 --> 1:23:13.269
- Oh, my God! Chris.
- That's a saying.

1:23:14.136 --> 1:23:15.637
Let's make
like a donkey dick

1:23:15.670 --> 1:23:16.872
and hit the road.

1:23:16.906 --> 1:23:18.673
Okay. I get it.

1:23:18.707 --> 1:23:20.076
Let's make like a tree
and leave.

1:23:20.109 --> 1:23:22.577
- Chris?
- Let's make tracks?
