WEBVTT

00:03.527 --> 00:04.061
Hey, man.

00:04.619 --> 00:07.254
I'm gonna hit the gym and sneak
in a quick workout. Wanna come?

00:07.255 --> 00:09.404
Sweating it out in a steam room isn't
exercising, buddy. 

00:09.404 --> 00:12.611
No, it's sit-cercising.
Newbie, gandhi, come here.

00:12.611 --> 00:16.430
great. Dr. Cox
and his golden boy med student.

00:16.431 --> 00:19.099
I wanted you to witness this.

00:19.100 --> 00:22.670
Number one, say good-bye
to the number one sign...

00:22.671 --> 00:24.705
Aw, that's too bad.

00:24.706 --> 00:27.408
Whoo-hoo! Arriba!

00:27.409 --> 00:31.579
And say hello
to the number one shirt.

00:31.580 --> 00:33.647
What?!
It's beautiful, honestly.

00:33.648 --> 00:34.816
The nicest shirt
I've ever received

00:34.817 --> 00:37.018
From a grown, married man.
Oh, go on.

00:37.019 --> 00:40.021
Please leave me alone.
Put it on.

00:40.022 --> 00:44.092
Hey, wow. That's--that's
some crazy ink you got there.

00:45.093 --> 00:48.696
What the hell is that thing, anyway?
I don't know. I woke up after a 3-day bender

00:48.697 --> 00:50.464
Driving a forklift and sporting this.

00:50.465 --> 00:53.000
"my name's drew. I'm so cool

00:53.001 --> 00:56.704
'cause I've been in prison
and I got a tattoo."

00:56.705 --> 01:00.374
mock him,
and I'll eat your soul!

01:00.375 --> 01:02.409
Tattoo spooked you
a little, huh?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.010
His breath was so cold.

01:04.012 --> 01:05.512
So cold.

01:07.682 --> 01:11.018
flapjacks!

01:11.019 --> 01:13.520
oh, thank god.

01:13.521 --> 01:16.056
I thought I was late
for dr. Cox's class.

01:16.057 --> 01:18.525
That would be the biggest
mistake I could make.

01:18.526 --> 01:21.028
Damn, girl.
That was a workout.

01:21.029 --> 01:23.397
Okay, second biggest.

01:23.398 --> 01:25.899
You know, normally,
I like to sleep in,

01:25.900 --> 01:28.235
But part of me is...
an early riser.

01:28.236 --> 01:31.138
Wow. This should not
have happened... Again.

01:31.139 --> 01:33.173
Not that it wasn't nice.

01:33.174 --> 01:35.809
You have small
but surprisingly powerful hands

01:35.810 --> 01:37.678
And almost no beard.

01:37.679 --> 01:40.481
It's like you were created
in a lab for a woman's pleasure.

01:40.482 --> 01:43.384
The thing about cole is that--
No, no.

01:43.385 --> 01:46.120
No third person.

01:47.555 --> 01:50.791
Let's begin
with some "q" and "a."

01:50.792 --> 01:52.593
You, seat filler,

01:52.594 --> 01:56.730
Tell me the thickest layers in the walls of veins.
Uh...

01:56.731 --> 01:59.633
Thank you for getting us off
to that rousing start.

01:59.634 --> 02:01.135
Who's next? Ah.

02:01.136 --> 02:03.904
Pinup girl
avoiding eye contact?

02:03.905 --> 02:05.906
Ugly don cheadle?

02:05.907 --> 02:08.475
What about you, legacy?
Got anything?

02:08.476 --> 02:10.511
Well, uh, you see...

02:10.512 --> 02:13.147
No, curiously, I don't see.

02:13.148 --> 02:14.948
when dr. Cox gets like this,

02:14.949 --> 02:17.484
It feels a lot like second grade gym class.

02:17.485 --> 02:20.621
all right, you hairless babies.

02:20.622 --> 02:22.823
Show some sack and pick up a ball.

02:22.824 --> 02:24.858
Who wants it? You? Huh?

02:24.859 --> 02:27.394
You? You! You're out!
watch out!Watch out?

02:27.395 --> 02:29.363
You!
Not in the face!

02:29.364 --> 02:31.765
Sure, in the face!
Take it!

02:31.766 --> 02:33.534
Anybody else?

02:33.535 --> 02:35.636
Oh, thank you, muffin.

02:37.839 --> 02:42.576
No!

02:44.913 --> 02:47.381
The thickest layers
of the walls of the veins

02:47.382 --> 02:50.084
Are the tunica externa.
Correct. Everyone else,

02:50.085 --> 02:53.087
Stare into my eyes
so I can clock the very instant

02:53.088 --> 02:55.723
When you first realized that
you're not going to make it.

02:55.724 --> 02:58.258
Here we go.

03:00.895 --> 03:03.964
Thank you. That was lovely.

03:03.965 --> 03:05.933
Hey, congrats, bro.

03:05.934 --> 03:08.001
You really brought it today.

03:08.002 --> 03:10.437
Oh, but who's that
nippin' at your heels?

03:10.438 --> 03:13.474
uh-oh. It's c-dog.
I'm sorry. I don't speak hipster gibberish.

03:13.475 --> 03:16.410
Oh, I'm talking about this epic
battle you and I are locked in

03:16.411 --> 03:19.613
For the number one spot.
Okay, I'm assuming you like to be called "dude."

03:19.614 --> 03:22.049
Love it.
Dude, I don't like the spotlight.

03:22.050 --> 03:24.051
I don't like
the extra attention.

03:24.052 --> 03:25.735
I tried med school before,
and I crashed and burned, okay?

03:25.735 --> 03:30.557
Oh, playing it humble. Nice angle.
But careful walking on the tracks

03:30.558 --> 03:32.392
'cause there's
a coal train a-comin'.

03:32.393 --> 03:36.330
choo-choo!

03:55.555 --> 03:56.189
I'm always psyched

03:56.190 --> 03:59.159
When dr. D. Asks me
to swing by for office hours.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.328
So tell me,
how's school going?

04:01.329 --> 04:03.797
Well, my hair is
falling out in clumps,

04:03.798 --> 04:06.933
But that's not necessarily
stress. Um, I am get older.

04:06.934 --> 04:09.936
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about, lucy.

04:09.937 --> 04:11.472
You need to be prepared
for when I leave.

04:11.473 --> 04:14.274
damn it! Why bring her
to the learning tree

04:14.275 --> 04:16.277
If you're not gonna use it
in your inspiring talk?

04:16.278 --> 04:18.813
My--my point is,
while I'm here, I'm yours,

04:18.814 --> 04:23.317
But you also need to...
Branch out. nailed it!

04:23.318 --> 04:26.720
I don't know if I can
get through med school alone.

04:26.721 --> 04:30.805
Don't worry.
Before I, uh, leaf...you're on fire.

04:30.805 --> 04:32.226
I'll make sure
that you have a mentor

04:32.227 --> 04:35.896
You're as close to as I am to mine.
Speak of the devil!

04:35.897 --> 04:40.900
Hey, perry, you wanna hang out later?
Sure. And if we can't find any more climbing trees,

04:40.901 --> 04:43.936
We'll just head down to the old
swimmin' hole and skip stones

04:43.937 --> 04:48.875
Until the fireflies tell us it's suppertime.
I assume that's a dis of some sort.

04:48.876 --> 04:50.343
Ahh!

04:50.344 --> 04:52.845
Oh, snap!
That hurt to watch.

04:52.846 --> 04:55.848
Can't wait to see that
on the surveillance tape.

04:55.849 --> 04:58.684
That's right.
We have cameras everywhere.

04:58.685 --> 05:01.387
We're watching you.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.489
Drive.
Copy that.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.360
I need a new mentor--

05:07.361 --> 05:09.896
Someone strong and not afraid
to express emotions.

05:09.897 --> 05:11.364
Maybe a woman.

05:11.365 --> 05:14.567
Give me my chips, you dirty bitch!
Or her.

05:14.568 --> 05:17.904
Help me shake this machine.
Dr. Mahoney,

05:17.905 --> 05:20.540
I was wondering if it would
be possible for me to, uh,

05:20.541 --> 05:22.642
Shadow you in the hospital.

05:22.643 --> 05:26.012
This is not over,
you filthy whore!

05:26.013 --> 05:28.948
Shadow me? Sure.
No, wait.

05:28.949 --> 05:31.918
I forgot you totally annoy me.
Is there any way you could

05:31.919 --> 05:35.821
Instantly change your entire personality?
I guess I could try.

05:35.822 --> 05:38.357
Even the way you said that
was irritating.

05:38.358 --> 05:39.856
Look, I'm not
the mentoring type, okay?

05:39.856 --> 05:43.596
Go ask turk.
I did, but he said, and I'm quoting now,

05:43.597 --> 05:46.599
"I already have dr. Bradley
all up in my business."

05:46.600 --> 05:49.936
Dr. Turk, thanks so much for
taking me under your wing.

05:49.937 --> 05:51.672
It's such a privilege, I feel
like I should be paying you,

05:51.673 --> 05:52.674
So...No,
I don't want your money.

05:52.675 --> 05:55.944
Okay,tearing it up, sir.
No, don't--don't tear up your money.

05:55.945 --> 05:59.480
My bad, sir. Taping it up.
Tom, you're ten years older than me

05:59.481 --> 06:01.756
And you have a wife and kid.
Please, have some dignity.

06:01.756 --> 06:02.853
Too late, sir.

06:05.684 --> 06:07.020
I wish dr. Cox
had some time for me,

06:07.021 --> 06:09.690
But I get it.
He's a busy man--

06:09.617 --> 06:12.051
A very busy... Man?

06:12.052 --> 06:13.987
Cheers.

06:22.263 --> 06:25.298
"sy-hwa"?

06:25.299 --> 06:28.501
it says, "why?"!

06:28.502 --> 06:32.004
Cox and I were drinking beer
and watching sports--

06:32.005 --> 06:35.274
Two things you hate.
First of all, turk, I've learned to pretend I enjoy beer.

06:35.275 --> 06:37.276
And secondly, I love sports.

06:37.277 --> 06:39.811
The opening ceremonies
for the winter olympics

06:39.812 --> 06:42.814
Is not a sport,and you cried during it.
Oh, you want to talk about crying?

06:42.815 --> 06:44.484
Let's talk about the end of "rudy."
hold on!

06:44.485 --> 06:47.487
He got on the field at the end
of the movie with his dad in--

06:47.488 --> 06:50.990
You know what? No. No, we're not going there.
Excuse me, dr. Dorian.

06:50.991 --> 06:54.293
Sorry I missed your class. Can I get the notes?
No. Actually, drew, you can't.

06:54.294 --> 06:56.296
And I'm gonna e-mail
the whole class and ask them

06:56.297 --> 06:57.554
Not to share their notes
with you.

06:57.554 --> 07:02.211
Then tomorrow,we'll have a quiz on it.
That seems excessive, but okay.

07:02.873 --> 07:03.764
What was the lecture on?

07:03.764 --> 07:06.065
I don't remember, drew.
It was 20 minutes ago.

07:08.965 --> 07:09.956
What are you doing?
I know, I know.

07:09.957 --> 07:12.892
It's just that cox is
draping himself over that kid

07:12.893 --> 07:16.862
Like a cheap hussy, and then
I have to find you and perry

07:16.863 --> 07:19.898
Canoodling in that sports-themed
tavern pretending you like beer.

07:19.899 --> 07:22.468
Well, we're not pretending.
We actually like beer.

07:22.469 --> 07:25.070
Oh, stop it, turk.
It's me.

07:25.071 --> 07:27.506
I just feel like
I'm being replaced.

07:27.507 --> 07:30.609
That'll never happen.Do you wanna know why?
Tell me this instant.

07:30.610 --> 07:32.745
Because you're
john damn dorian.

07:32.746 --> 07:35.013
You're right.
I am john damn dorian.

07:35.014 --> 07:38.016
You john-damn right, you are!
Now gimme a chest bump.

07:38.017 --> 07:41.120
Yeah, but don't flex 'cause
it'll knock the wind out of me.

07:41.121 --> 07:43.956
see? Can't breathe.

07:43.957 --> 07:46.458
I'm sorry, white bread.
I'm not currently looking for

07:46.459 --> 07:48.293
A protÃ©gÃ©/suck-up.
dr. Mahoney,

07:48.294 --> 07:51.363
I am not sucking up.
If I were sucking up,

07:51.364 --> 07:52.500
I would tell you
how much I like your shoes.

07:52.901 --> 07:55.669
Which I do, by the way.
They're mannish, yet flirty,

07:55.670 --> 07:58.672
Like, "hey, boys.
Come watch me build a deck."

07:58.673 --> 08:00.774
Look, I just really, really want to shadow you. Please?
Gurney.

08:00.775 --> 08:02.709
What?  oh!

08:02.710 --> 08:05.045
Uh, I think I'm on your tube.

08:05.046 --> 08:07.447
that's how I eat.
Sorry!

08:07.448 --> 08:10.650
Uh, dr. Mahoney,
if you do let me shadow you--

08:10.651 --> 08:14.621
For the last time, no.

08:15.444 --> 08:18.979
How you feeling today?
Well, I have my up days and down days.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.391
Some weeks I have more
up days than down days.

08:20.391 --> 08:22.236
Like last week, I had
four up days, one down day.

08:22.236 --> 08:23.625
I was like, "whoo-hoo!
Let's have a party!"

08:23.625 --> 08:26.651
But today I think I could really use a hug.
Lucy!

08:26.651 --> 08:28.678
I changed my mind.

08:28.678 --> 08:33.061
You can start shadowing me
by hugging mrs. Maroney.

08:33.062 --> 08:35.496
Okay, dr. Mahoney.
Wait a second...

08:35.498 --> 08:36.965
Maroney, mahoney-- that is so funny!

08:36.966 --> 08:40.333
Yeah,
not as I understand funny.

08:40.335 --> 08:42.469
Take mrs. Maroney down
for her m.R.I.

08:42.470 --> 08:44.939
Oh, can you keep an eye on my son?
Your what?

08:46.909 --> 08:48.710
Excuse me.

08:50.711 --> 08:52.646
Hey, watch a kid for me?

08:52.647 --> 08:54.781
No, I'm afraid of kids.
He's 12.

08:54.782 --> 08:56.451
I got shot by a 12-year-old
at a petting zoo.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.220
Besides, I gotta change this
shirt. The neck's choking me.

08:58.221 --> 09:01.957
we get it, drew.
You got a very muscular neck.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.161
All right, team. This should be
fairly straightforward.

09:08.162 --> 09:09.596
Scalpel.

09:09.597 --> 09:11.118
Drew's rubbing this
t-shirt thing in my face.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.511
J.D., what the hell? I'm in surgery.
It's not even the right color for him.

09:14.511 --> 09:16.606
He's clearly an autumn.
You've lost it.

09:16.606 --> 09:17.870
Dr. Turk is right.

09:17.870 --> 09:20.053
You should be asleep.
She should be asleep!

09:20.408 --> 09:21.909
That's my fault, sir.

09:21.910 --> 09:24.878
If anyone gets sued for this,
it's gonna be me.

09:24.879 --> 09:27.314
Look, you gotta remember,
you're john damn dorian.

09:27.315 --> 09:30.050
So think about it.
What would john damn dorian do?

09:30.051 --> 09:32.986
W.W.J.D.D.D.D.?

09:32.987 --> 09:35.989
Was that too many d's?
Why are you awake?!

09:35.990 --> 09:38.058
this thing is so complicated.

09:38.059 --> 09:40.561
You're not that petty kid
anymore. Just let it go.

09:40.562 --> 09:42.396
I could do that, or...

09:42.397 --> 09:45.999
Okay, a patient has hypotension,
hyperpigmentation of skin

09:46.000 --> 09:49.503
And hyponatremia. What
diagnostic test should we run?

09:49.504 --> 09:51.905
Ooh! I know! I know!

09:51.906 --> 09:54.074
Anyone but the board-certified doctor?

09:54.075 --> 09:55.976
Good call. I'll observe.

09:55.977 --> 09:58.912
We do an a.C.T.H.
Stimulation test to diagnose--

09:58.913 --> 10:00.581
Addison's disease!
It's addison's disease!

10:00.582 --> 10:04.051
I was gonna say that.
Well, we'll never know, will we, drew?

10:04.052 --> 10:06.253
Walking tall, dorian.
Walking tall.

10:06.254 --> 10:08.689
feeling tall, perry.

10:08.690 --> 10:11.759
Okay, I'll admit it.
Kids are good for something.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.263
I can get you the mints,

10:13.263 --> 10:15.711
But if you want these chips,
I might dislocate my shoulder.

10:15.711 --> 10:16.586
Chips

10:16.586 --> 10:20.100
Fine. Ah, got 'em.
Nicely done.

10:20.101 --> 10:22.402
with my mom
in the hospital all the time,

10:22.403 --> 10:24.772
I just figured out how to do this.
Yeah, I never knew my mom.

10:24.773 --> 10:28.709
You gonna cry about it?
No. Here you go.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.711
Oh!

10:30.712 --> 10:32.679
Mm, you gonna cry about it?

10:36.270 --> 10:38.662
Excluding number one here,
today's assignment

10:38.662 --> 10:41.035
Is for everyone
to drop out of medical school.

10:41.035 --> 10:43.315
Your parents' money
would be better stuffed into

10:43.315 --> 10:46.031
Garbage bags, packed io
a rocket and shot into the sun.

10:47.324 --> 10:50.338
oh, my. This gentleman appears
to be coding. What a delight.

10:50.338 --> 10:52.580
Who would like tdive in?
I'm on this.

10:52.580 --> 10:55.316
Where the hell did you get a scalpel?
Uh, present from my unc.

10:55.732 --> 10:58.021
Handle's made from elephant
tusk. It's mad illegal, yo.

10:58.021 --> 11:00.289
Step off. Number one, jump in.
Excuse me?

11:00.289 --> 11:01.675
do you know why
I call him number one?

11:01.675 --> 11:04.529
It's because he is roger
and ready to do this stuff.

11:04.795 --> 11:07.096
Drew, run the code. What's first?
I don't know.

11:07.097 --> 11:09.865
I'm standing right here next
to you. Let's take his pulse.

11:09.866 --> 11:12.001
Now tell me which nurse should
go get the crash cart?
Huh?

11:12.002 --> 11:14.270
He who hesitates is lost.
Take a breath.

11:14.271 --> 11:15.705
Make a decision.
Uh, her.

11:15.706 --> 11:18.708
Tell her to do something.
Go get the crash cart.

11:18.709 --> 11:20.977
Now we're cookin'.

11:20.978 --> 11:23.646
Around here, you can be
thrown into the mix

11:23.647 --> 11:25.748
At a moment's notice.

11:26.691 --> 11:28.192
I'll be right back.

11:30.952 --> 11:34.355
Um, I've got the results
of ryan's mom's m.R.I.

11:35.957 --> 11:38.092
What's it say?

11:38.093 --> 11:40.061
That she's dying.

11:46.101 --> 11:48.602
Bring him back to her room.

11:48.603 --> 11:52.206
You just have to hope
you're up to the task at hand.

11:52.207 --> 11:54.041
You're doing really great.

11:54.042 --> 11:55.910
Is this guy dying?
Probably.

11:55.911 --> 11:58.913
But he's been circling the drain
for months, so it's no biggie.

11:58.914 --> 12:01.248
Now he's unresponsive to c.P.R., what's next?
I don't know!

12:01.249 --> 12:02.019
Sure you do. Think.
I don't!

12:02.019 --> 12:05.410
Come on, drew, tell me.
This is insane! I'm not ready for this!

12:06.997 --> 12:08.703
of course,
if you let someone down...

12:10.140 --> 12:11.771
Newbie!
A little help here, please.

12:12.492 --> 12:13.394
Thank you.

12:14.206 --> 12:16.402
It can turn into
someone else's moment to shine.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.593
there's no better way
to celebrate saving a life

12:25.593 --> 12:26.793
Than pretending to like beer.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.497
Ohh, sticky.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.634
Yep, I'm sitting
between my best bud

12:32.635 --> 12:35.370
And my abusive father figure,
watching my new favorite thing.

12:35.371 --> 12:37.138
Footballing!

12:37.139 --> 12:39.841
They're staring.
Quick, talk like a jock!

12:39.842 --> 12:42.410
Sports grass is so lovely.

12:42.411 --> 12:44.653
Here I thought we weren't
bringing our wives this evening.

12:44.653 --> 12:45.755
Speaking of ich,

12:45.755 --> 12:48.182
Carla can't make it to
the owlcats game this Friday.

12:48.183 --> 12:50.785
We have an extra ticket.
I'm in! I'm in!

12:50.786 --> 12:53.655
I gotta see this sports grass in person.
Excuse me, dr. Cox.

12:53.656 --> 12:56.391
I don't mean to interrupt,
but, uh, I have to apologize.

12:56.392 --> 12:59.327
I've made a lot of bad choices
in le. Quick example--

12:59.328 --> 13:01.929
I accidentally, uh, set a shrimp
boat on fire once.

13:01.930 --> 13:03.998
It was a long story.
Another time.

13:03.999 --> 13:06.467
But, um, today was
one of those bad choices,

13:06.468 --> 13:08.970
And if I had
the power to go back in time--

13:08.971 --> 13:12.273
You know, drew, we all wish
we had superpowers, okay?

13:12.274 --> 13:15.410
Do you know what the perfect
superhero power would be?

13:15.411 --> 13:16.744
candy hands!

13:17.836 --> 13:20.838
For me, it would be
the ability to get back

13:20.839 --> 13:24.375
All the time I wasted on people
who eventually let me down.

13:24.376 --> 13:27.845
Awesome.

13:27.846 --> 13:30.281
Dude, think about it--
candy hands.

13:30.282 --> 13:32.683
Everything you touch
turns to candy.

13:32.684 --> 13:34.385
Whoop! Candy lamp.

13:34.386 --> 13:36.320
Candy perry!

13:36.321 --> 13:38.790
No candy perry.

13:40.025 --> 13:41.859
I don't know

13:41.860 --> 13:44.729
How I'll ever be ready
to give people news like that.

13:47.533 --> 13:50.001
You all right?

13:50.002 --> 13:51.936
I'm super.

13:51.937 --> 13:53.771
Goway.

13:56.675 --> 13:58.075
Hey.

13:58.076 --> 13:59.911
Hey.

13:59.912 --> 14:02.880
I know the next couple months
are really gonna suck.

14:02.881 --> 14:06.117
If I had any questions,
could I, like, call you?

14:06.118 --> 14:10.688
Yeah, I dot know, ryan.

14:10.689 --> 14:15.460
Well... Okay, cool.

14:19.565 --> 14:22.066
Why is the college mascot
an owlcat?

14:22.067 --> 14:25.403
I don't even know what an owlcat is.
I like to think it's what happens

14:25.404 --> 14:27.805
When an owl and a cat
fall in love.

14:27.806 --> 14:30.408
Hey, there's my kiss-ass
with some pizza.

14:30.409 --> 14:31.601
I'll be back
with a couple of slices.

14:31.601 --> 14:35.980
Dr. Dorian. Do you have a second?
No.

14:38.970 --> 14:41.271
I mean, sure.

14:43.341 --> 14:46.276
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ok at! Whoo-hoo!

14:46.277 --> 14:49.112
Look at that right there.
Look.

14:49.113 --> 14:50.581
Appreciate you.

14:55.487 --> 14:56.787
Oh!

14:56.788 --> 14:58.121
Dr. Mahoney.

14:58.122 --> 14:59.957
Hey, I need to talk.

14:59.958 --> 15:02.025
Oh, my god.

15:04.963 --> 15:06.730
Were you raised by horses?

15:06.731 --> 15:08.932
No.
I wish.

15:08.933 --> 15:10.801
I was just studying.

15:10.802 --> 15:12.636
What's up, shorty?

15:12.637 --> 15:14.605
And fornicating.

15:14.606 --> 15:17.241
Cole, get back under
the horse blanket, please.

15:17.242 --> 15:20.878
I was thinking that maybe the three of us--
cole! Horse blanket.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.646
Fine.

15:22.647 --> 15:25.816
Maybe we should just go outside.
Great idea.

15:25.817 --> 15:28.886
You want me to help ryan
through his mom's death?

15:28.887 --> 15:31.221
It'll only be
a few months, a year, tops.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.457
Come on. It'll be fun.

15:33.458 --> 15:36.894
It'll be like having a really sad pen pal.
What are you doing? You should help him.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.530
Listen up, seabiscuit.
Th isn't my wheelhouse, okay?

15:39.531 --> 15:42.432
It's taken me a long time
to get to a point

15:42.433 --> 15:44.801
That I can be there
emotionally for a patient.

15:44.802 --> 15:47.871
You know how I do it?
Every second that they're here,

15:47.872 --> 15:50.741
I remind myself that
once they leave this hospital,

15:50.742 --> 15:53.110
Either on their own
or in a box,

15:53.111 --> 15:55.112
They're no longer
my problem anymore.

15:55.113 --> 15:57.414
Out the door,
out of my head.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.286
It's the only way it works
for me.

15:58.286 --> 16:01.352
I still think you should do it,
but I'll talk to ryan.

16:01.352 --> 16:05.389
Good.
And another thing--

16:05.390 --> 16:07.357
I do love horses.

16:07.358 --> 16:09.860
They are
god's most majestic creatures.

16:09.861 --> 16:14.598
If they could talk,
they would be so very wise.

16:16.734 --> 16:19.670
I've been in a pretty deep hole
the past couple years--

16:19.671 --> 16:21.572
A lot of
self-destructive stuff.

16:21.573 --> 16:23.440
Honestly, the only thing

16:23.441 --> 16:25.776
I've burnt more than
shrimp boats is bridges.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.812
I need to change that.
What do you want from me?

16:28.813 --> 16:31.381
I understand you and dr. Cox
have a special relationship.

16:31.382 --> 16:33.283
He's kinda like my dad.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.794
Well, I was hoping you could
help me fix this with him.

16:34.794 --> 16:39.156
You know, dr-- It's drew, right?
Yeah.

16:39.157 --> 16:42.426
Drew, I've known perry cox
a very long me,

16:42.427 --> 16:44.661
And once he's made up his mind
about someone,

16:44.662 --> 16:47.564
He's never gonna change it.
I wish I could help.

16:50.501 --> 16:52.502
That's awesome.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.709
You're not gonna
help him out, huh?

16:58.710 --> 17:01.578
Kinda sucks. I thought you
wanted to be a good teacher.

17:01.579 --> 17:04.047
During the day,
I'm a good teacher,

17:04.048 --> 17:06.550
But right now
I'm ready for a little

17:06.550 --> 17:09.051
"magnum p.I." crustache.
I'm gonna be magnum p.I.,

17:09.053 --> 17:11.887
And you're gonna be
black higgins.

17:11.888 --> 17:14.023
You should talk to dr. Cox.

17:16.461 --> 17:18.895
I'm questioning
a lot of things today--

17:18.896 --> 17:20.896
Like my choice in men...

17:20.897 --> 17:22.898
hey, babe, check it out.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.902
I'm dr. Wolverine.

17:25.903 --> 17:28.939
And my choice in mentors.
I really don't want to do

17:28.940 --> 17:31.375
Dr. Mahoney's
dirty work for her.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.644
I got this.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.817
Oh, I love that game.

17:40.818 --> 17:43.220
If you want
to beat the level,

17:43.221 --> 17:44.004
You gotta take that sniper out
in the church.

17:44.004 --> 17:45.488
I know. 

17:45.488 --> 17:48.859
Hey, I know you guys
are going home today...

17:48.860 --> 17:50.794
So I wanted to give you

17:50.795 --> 17:53.563
My cell phone number

17:53.564 --> 17:56.400
In case you
still want to talk ever.

17:56.401 --> 17:58.368
Whatever.

18:04.842 --> 18:06.943
Give me that.
You're horrible.

18:06.944 --> 18:09.946
I'll get the sniper.

18:18.458 --> 18:21.193
What the hell are you wearing?
I'm showing my owlcat spirit.

18:21.194 --> 18:23.478
If it's not enough, I have
wings and talons in the car.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.120
Is that glitter? Hell, no!

18:26.120 --> 18:28.888
But it came with the makeup kit.
I don't have to use it. Today...

18:30.790 --> 18:32.437
Oh, for the love of god,
francine!

18:32.777 --> 18:34.243
I gotta go get
the tickets at will-call.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.104
Please don't let him
put the glitter on.

18:38.045 --> 18:39.569
I've never heard that sentence
uttered about another man.

18:39.569 --> 18:43.023
Perry, uh, I want to talk to you
about drew for a second.

18:43.023 --> 18:44.997
I-I really think you're
making a mistake with him.

18:44.997 --> 18:47.054
Don't you have some gay dance
rehearsal you got to attend?

18:47.054 --> 18:48.881
He has potential, and you know it.

18:48.881 --> 18:50.700
He's too old.
He's experienced.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.115
He quit.
But he came back.

18:52.115 --> 18:55.094
What exactly
do you want from me?

18:55.740 --> 18:58.575
I want you to realize
you set the bar too high.

18:58.576 --> 19:00.944
The attention
that you're giving to drew--

19:00.945 --> 19:03.947
I would've killed for that
eight years ago.

19:03.948 --> 19:06.783
But you weren't ready yet.
I had to break you down.

19:06.784 --> 19:10.053
I tamed you... Like a bull.

19:10.054 --> 19:12.822
Excuse me, are we approaching
a point here, dorian?

19:12.823 --> 19:15.725
Perry, you finally found
someone to believe in.

19:15.726 --> 19:17.994
Don't ruin it by being you.

19:20.931 --> 19:24.367
I think I just
mentored my mentor,

19:24.368 --> 19:26.803
But maybe
that's how it always is.

19:26.804 --> 19:28.905
Our roles
are always switching.

19:28.906 --> 19:31.608
Sometimes you're a student,

19:31.609 --> 19:34.344
And sometimes you're a teacher.

19:34.345 --> 19:38.648
Lucy, you still wantto shadow me?
More than horses love rainbows!

19:38.649 --> 19:42.031
Let's go. Too close.

19:43.420 --> 19:46.656
And if you're smart enough,
everyone can learn something.

19:46.657 --> 19:49.659
One more question,
and all you little assassins

19:49.660 --> 19:52.128
Can get out of here.
Someone please tell me

19:52.129 --> 19:55.598
Where the foramen ovale
in the fetal heart is located?

19:55.599 --> 19:59.202
Drew, save us, please.

20:01.205 --> 20:03.740
Uh, the interatrial septum.

20:03.741 --> 20:05.809
Yes. Nicely done.

20:05.810 --> 20:08.545
I'll expect you to be
wearing your shirt tomorrow.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.848
Everyone leave now.

20:11.849 --> 20:16.386
But whatever you do, don't wait
for that pat on the back.

20:16.387 --> 20:20.089
Because, believe me,
it will never, ever--

20:20.090 --> 20:21.224
Oh, come on!

20:29.882 --> 20:32.784
Oh, I love you, sports grass.

20:32.852 --> 20:34.786
It is pretty soft.

20:34.854 --> 20:37.822
Pretty soft?
It's like lying on a cloud.

20:37.890 --> 20:38.328
Why did they have to ruin you

20:38.328 --> 20:40.601
By painting all
these numbers and lines?

20:43.162 --> 20:45.511
Hey, captain. Looks like
we got some more turf freaks.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.090
Found some what?
check this out.

20:48.090 --> 20:50.379
That is disgusting.
Mm-hmm!

20:50.379 --> 20:53.707
Unh-unh.
Warm up the golf cart and get the taser.

20:53.707 --> 20:55.732
The mexican one?
El conquistador.

20:55.732 --> 20:56.506
Let's do it.
