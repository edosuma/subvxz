00:39.821 --> 00:42.984
The story you are
about to see is true.

00:45.075 --> 00:46.313
As far as I know.

01:08.809 --> 01:10.064
Okay.

01:11.856 --> 01:14.519
I'm sorry the people
just turn and look at you

01:14.579 --> 01:16.381
as if you are from the zoo.

01:16.442 --> 01:18.426
Don't worry. I am from the zoo.

01:18.487 --> 01:20.809
Somehow I don't feel it's
going to be safe for you.

01:20.870 --> 01:23.485
Look, don't get out of the
car until I tell you to, okay?

01:23.899 --> 01:25.477
-You're getting out?
-Yeah.

01:26.903 --> 01:28.464
It's okay, I'll be fine.

02:05.253 --> 02:06.473
It's so joyful.

02:06.534 --> 02:08.231
Just had the first victory.

02:08.422 --> 02:09.918
And there are lots
of other people too,

02:09.979 --> 02:11.360
and you'll see them there.

02:37.219 --> 02:39.342
Jennifer, sweetheart,
it's me again.

02:39.403 --> 02:40.997
Would you call me back, please?

02:43.333 --> 02:45.331
You're not gonna
believe what I found.

02:45.535 --> 02:48.069
This story that you
wrote in English class.

02:48.403 --> 02:49.623
I'm worried about you.

02:51.613 --> 02:53.403
Jennifer, I really
need to talk to you.

02:53.486 --> 02:56.233
I don't know where you are.
I mean, you could be anywhere.

02:56.316 --> 02:57.487
I'm going to send this to you.

02:57.548 --> 02:58.862
I'm going to send
it express mail,

02:58.923 --> 03:00.008
and I want you to read it.

03:00.069 --> 03:01.069
Call me, please.

03:03.522 --> 03:06.029
Hey, babe. I guess you're
already on the plane.

03:06.349 --> 03:08.846
Have a good trip back. I'll
see you when you get home.

03:08.929 --> 03:09.793
Love you.

03:14.924 --> 03:16.198
I think that's why my

03:16.450 --> 03:18.440
partner's special, because
he's probably the...

03:18.664 --> 03:23.153
only man I've really and
consistently loved for 10 years.

03:24.214 --> 03:25.594
Do you want to have children?

03:25.830 --> 03:28.537
Yeah. Oh, I get
the motherly urge.

03:28.905 --> 03:30.103
I want children.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.737
Then I think, no,

03:36.153 --> 03:37.944
on Monday, I have a meeting,

03:38.127 --> 03:41.240
on Tuesday, I have
a demonstration,

03:41.301 --> 03:44.728
on Thursday, my bank
meeting, on Friday...

03:49.997 --> 03:52.445
Babe. I come bearing gifts.

03:54.305 --> 03:55.886
You got me something?

03:56.176 --> 03:56.957
Yeah.

04:49.938 --> 04:50.818
Where are you?

04:52.602 --> 04:53.900
Nowhere. I'm just...

04:56.566 --> 04:59.249
Sorry, I was just
thinking about my mom.

04:59.310 --> 05:01.636
She's been calling, and, um...

05:04.632 --> 05:07.907
she, uh, read this
story I wrote...

05:08.800 --> 05:11.127
when I was a kid about
my first boyfriend.

05:11.254 --> 05:12.198
And...

05:13.690 --> 05:15.851
I hadn't told her about
it, because he was older.

05:15.934 --> 05:18.785
So she's beside herself,

05:18.845 --> 05:20.114
trying to reach me.

05:20.873 --> 05:21.661
Babe.

05:22.968 --> 05:25.038
You know, I never shot
in Atlanta before.

05:25.734 --> 05:26.762
You got everything?

05:27.404 --> 05:28.205
Yeah.

05:29.731 --> 05:30.958
I'm kinda excited.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.436
-It's gonna go great.
-Yeah.

05:37.717 --> 05:39.144
So that came for you.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.201
Oh, yeah?

05:40.262 --> 05:41.618
-It's from your mom.
-Yeah.

05:44.050 --> 05:45.216
I'm gonna miss you.

05:47.495 --> 05:48.937
-Love you.
-Love you.

05:48.998 --> 05:50.675
-I'll be back Tuesday.
-Okay.

06:05.903 --> 06:08.622
Mom! Mother!

06:13.793 --> 06:15.408
You're getting it all over me.

06:15.468 --> 06:16.594
I just need you to eat a little.

06:17.803 --> 06:20.958
Can you get the milk for the...
I need milk for Lucy's.

06:22.948 --> 06:24.188
Sit down! Now!

06:24.249 --> 06:25.578
Excuse me. Come here.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.623
Go and sit!

06:27.866 --> 06:29.041
Go! Sit!

06:33.208 --> 06:35.379
And does it abut
on protected land?

06:35.858 --> 06:36.582
Yes.

06:37.031 --> 06:38.693
Well, I'm going to need
to have it assessed.

06:39.523 --> 06:41.644
I can have my guy out there
by the end of the week.

06:42.270 --> 06:43.235
Yes, of course.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.669
I'd like to begin this story

06:48.293 --> 06:50.879
by telling you
something so beautiful.

07:03.593 --> 07:04.306
Yeah, hey.

07:04.367 --> 07:05.952
I've been so worried about you.

07:06.013 --> 07:08.325
-Did you read it yet?
-No. Where'd you find it?

07:08.386 --> 07:10.788
It was in a box in
the storage room.

07:10.849 --> 07:12.800
What does it matter
where I found it?

07:12.973 --> 07:15.762
What matters is what it says.

07:16.017 --> 07:17.188
What happened?

07:17.361 --> 07:18.811
What... what are
you talking about?

07:18.871 --> 07:21.119
You lied to me all these years.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.570
Mom, this is why
I didn't tell you,

07:23.631 --> 07:25.297
because I knew you'd
react this way.

07:25.392 --> 07:26.850
Oh, what is that
supposed to mean?

07:26.911 --> 07:28.327
That I'm too stupid
to understand?

07:28.388 --> 07:30.266
No, I never said that.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.596
I found Bill on the Internet.

07:34.278 --> 07:35.013
What?

07:35.073 --> 07:37.548
There he is, for all
the world to see.

07:37.995 --> 07:39.315
Famous as ever.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.012
Hold on, I'm gonna
go in the office.

07:41.131 --> 07:41.857
Just a minute.

07:42.181 --> 07:44.369
Mom, what are you talking about?

07:44.430 --> 07:46.151
Did you ever try looking him up?

07:46.212 --> 07:48.812
No, I thought he was,
I don't know, dead or...

07:48.953 --> 07:51.803
Well, all you have to
do is type in his name.

07:57.146 --> 07:58.255
Oh, my God.

07:59.533 --> 08:00.548
Oh, my God.

08:01.763 --> 08:03.257
He looks so much older.

08:03.318 --> 08:05.131
I couldn't find
anything on her, though.

08:05.191 --> 08:08.563
However, I do know somebody
who'd put me in touch

08:08.624 --> 08:09.216
with Becky Davis.

08:09.277 --> 08:11.147
Yeah, Becky was
there that summer.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.970
Yeah, and she lives
right over on Fairview.

08:14.182 --> 08:15.381
What are you talking about?

08:15.442 --> 08:18.076
You know, you haven't come
down for, like, two months.

08:18.256 --> 08:19.657
I could use a little help.

08:19.724 --> 08:22.807
-Mom, what are you doing?
-Well, maybe she knows

08:22.868 --> 08:24.878
how we could get in
touch with Mrs. G.

08:25.203 --> 08:27.983
I can't do this
this weekend, okay?

08:28.044 --> 08:29.639
I've got papers to grade,

08:29.700 --> 08:32.085
and Martin wants me to
look at venues on Saturday.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.606
You're 48 years old.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.173
You've been engaged
for three years.

08:35.246 --> 08:36.725
He's not going anywhere.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.934
I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

08:41.198 --> 08:42.571
Okay. Love you.

08:42.868 --> 08:44.484
Love you. Bye.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.206
I'd like to begin this story

08:59.973 --> 09:02.071
by telling you
something so beautiful.

09:03.314 --> 09:05.440
I've met two very special people

09:05.574 --> 09:07.322
whom I've come to love dearly.

09:09.447 --> 09:11.866
Imagine a woman who's married

09:13.397 --> 09:15.223
and a man who is divorced

09:16.038 --> 09:18.641
sharing their lives
in close friendship.

09:20.075 --> 09:22.304
Loving each other with
all their souls...

09:24.823 --> 09:27.044
yet not being close
with their bodies.

09:29.861 --> 09:30.731
Get this...

09:31.542 --> 09:33.018
I'm part of them both.

09:36.519 --> 09:37.562
I'm lucky enough

09:37.691 --> 09:39.898
to be able to share
in their love.

09:41.794 --> 09:43.263
When I'm away from them,

09:43.771 --> 09:46.034
the earth seems to
shake and tremble...

09:47.415 --> 09:49.631
and often I'm afraid
I'll fall off of it.

09:59.670 --> 10:00.910
Well, that was fast.

10:00.971 --> 10:02.291
Did you come to your senses?

10:02.352 --> 10:04.121
Mom, you are so wrong.

10:04.182 --> 10:05.860
What am I wrong about now?

10:05.921 --> 10:07.943
Mrs. G was an incredible woman.

10:08.004 --> 10:11.239
Did you read what your
teacher said on the back page?

10:11.300 --> 10:12.747
Read it. Now.

10:13.039 --> 10:15.923
'If what you talk about
here were accurate,

10:15.984 --> 10:20.961
'I would say you had been taken
advantage of by older people.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.150
'But clearly you have a fine,

10:24.557 --> 10:27.749
full set of emotions
blossoming into womanhood.'

10:27.810 --> 10:30.789
You see? Even your English
teacher knew without telling me.

10:30.886 --> 10:34.564
Can you just let me sit
with my own memories?

10:34.725 --> 10:36.650
No, I want you to nail them.

10:36.995 --> 10:39.380
Mom, please.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.449
It makes me want
to see her again.

10:56.117 --> 10:57.072
Who are you?

10:57.321 --> 10:58.179
Jennifer.

11:00.196 --> 11:00.761
Who?

11:01.448 --> 11:02.235
Jenny.

11:03.689 --> 11:06.033
The girl over there
arriving at your house.

11:07.518 --> 11:09.432
Oh. Jenny.

11:10.021 --> 11:11.595
You're coming to
spend the summer here.

11:11.815 --> 11:13.176
So you remember me?

11:14.301 --> 11:15.917
Of course I remember you.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.151
You've had a few lessons.

11:18.212 --> 11:19.367
Am I talented?

11:19.593 --> 11:20.793
Am I a good rider?

11:20.919 --> 11:22.430
No, I wouldn't say so.

11:22.577 --> 11:23.606
Not a natural.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.716
Your family's rich, though.

11:26.239 --> 11:28.246
-Jews.
-Jews?

11:29.165 --> 11:31.336
I'd never met a Jew
until I came to America.

11:31.944 --> 11:33.264
Jews don't ride horses.

11:33.683 --> 11:35.539
Ever seen a Jew
competing at Brighton?

11:39.534 --> 11:40.793
I suppose I should
get on with it.

11:42.651 --> 11:43.509
Hi, there.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.250
-You must be Jane.
-I am.

11:45.310 --> 11:46.452
I'm Aaron, it's
nice to meet you.

11:46.513 --> 11:48.693
-So nice to meet you finally.
-Finally face-to-face.

11:48.754 --> 11:50.463
-Many phone calls later.
-It's a pleasure.

11:50.946 --> 11:52.664
-Jenny, how are you?
-Good, how are you?

11:52.725 --> 11:53.781
I'm well,

11:54.237 --> 11:56.322
I'm well. Let's take
him to the stalls.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.200
Okay.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.363
Hey, Mom, what did you
say Becky's address was?

12:02.450 --> 12:03.663
Can you text it to me?

12:05.886 --> 12:07.815
Why are you telling
this story, Jenny?

12:08.942 --> 12:10.553
I always wanted to
have a story to tell,

12:10.614 --> 12:13.092
but nothing ever
happened to me before.

12:14.622 --> 12:16.724
-This is a beautiful piece of property.
-Oh, thank you.

12:17.077 --> 12:20.057
She was the most beautiful
woman I had ever met.

12:20.117 --> 12:21.489
Oh, it's so nice to have her...

12:21.550 --> 12:23.526
I knew my father
would fall for her.

12:24.694 --> 12:25.730
Everyone did.

12:27.318 --> 12:28.100
I did.

12:29.274 --> 12:30.614
And there are two other girls

12:30.674 --> 12:32.150
who are joining
Jenny this afternoon.

12:32.211 --> 12:33.792
-I see.
-Which is lovely.

12:34.693 --> 12:36.033
Good number, I think.

12:36.309 --> 12:38.307
Not too many to
keep an eyeball on.

12:40.318 --> 12:42.202
When Jenny first started
with this horse business

12:42.262 --> 12:43.313
I didn't understand it.

12:43.374 --> 12:45.366
-Really?
-Her mother still doesn't.

12:47.429 --> 12:49.323
I see now how good it
is for her, though.

12:49.723 --> 12:52.037
Do you know, in Russia, Jews
were not allowed to ride horses?

12:52.098 --> 12:53.117
-Dad!
-What?

12:53.817 --> 12:55.737
Because no Jew could be
higher than a Russian.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.534
But Jenny's great-great-uncle,
he was very tall.

12:59.155 --> 13:01.325
-And he rode a horse.
-Dad, please.

13:01.386 --> 13:03.221
-What?
-You ready to work hard

13:03.288 --> 13:04.704
for the next few weeks, missus?

13:05.656 --> 13:06.367
Yes.

13:08.044 --> 13:09.038
Right, off we go.

13:26.012 --> 13:27.461
Take the salad, Franny.

13:27.976 --> 13:29.184
You take the rest.

13:29.245 --> 13:30.177
Thank you, Becky.

13:31.640 --> 13:32.973
And you, Mrs. Cat.

13:34.037 --> 13:36.238
It's hot. Use your
gloves, please.

13:40.281 --> 13:43.824
Never, ever, ever put a
pie crust on the bottom.

13:44.284 --> 13:45.305
It only gets soggy.

13:46.512 --> 13:47.724
That and the raisins

13:47.784 --> 13:49.810
are the secret to the
perfect apple pie.

13:51.780 --> 13:52.845
But don't you tell anyone.

13:54.944 --> 13:55.586
Off you go.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.383
Dr. G and I are so pleased

13:59.444 --> 14:00.627
to welcome you to our home

14:00.687 --> 14:02.840
for what we're sure will
be a fine summer season.

14:03.939 --> 14:05.658
Franny, would you lead
us in grace, please?

14:06.070 --> 14:08.458
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mom, can I say it?

14:08.519 --> 14:09.292
Raymond!

14:10.915 --> 14:11.695
Of course you can.

14:14.173 --> 14:15.351
Bless us...

14:16.614 --> 14:18.419
-Lord.
-Lord,

14:18.480 --> 14:21.436
and these gifts that
we're about to eat.

14:22.501 --> 14:26.109
And thank you for the
friends and family

14:26.170 --> 14:28.755
that are gathered here with us,

14:29.535 --> 14:31.547
and keep us safe...

14:36.004 --> 14:37.664
How do people change?

14:39.535 --> 14:40.358
When I was a child,

14:40.419 --> 14:42.448
I was obsessed with
changing myself.

14:44.860 --> 14:46.907
Now I don't even
remember how I got here.

14:49.349 --> 14:50.747
Or who I used to be.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.158
Wow, look at you.

14:56.219 --> 14:57.326
You know, it's funny.

14:58.157 --> 14:59.905
I don't remember anything

14:59.965 --> 15:02.629
of what I learned,
riding-wise, from Mrs. G.

15:02.928 --> 15:04.741
But I remember
learning discipline.

15:05.003 --> 15:06.255
Yeah, me too.

15:06.316 --> 15:10.354
Her idea that you enduring
pain makes you better.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.165
You know I, um,
I kept my horse there

15:15.388 --> 15:16.557
after that summer.

15:16.618 --> 15:18.076
Oh, you were lucky.

15:18.747 --> 15:20.069
You got more time with her.

15:20.873 --> 15:21.595
Yeah.

15:21.812 --> 15:24.859
My parents, they never
would have let me stay.

15:25.066 --> 15:28.891
I was an only child, so
they watched me like a hawk.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.209
Well, I was one of five,
so they barely noticed

15:31.270 --> 15:32.553
if I wasn't there.

15:32.876 --> 15:36.010
You know, I found some
photos from that summer.

15:36.071 --> 15:38.472
-Oh, great.
-Thought you might like to see them.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.299
Do you ever see Mrs. G
at riding events or...?

15:43.616 --> 15:46.850
Oh, I saw Franny a few years back.
I...

15:46.911 --> 15:47.565
-You did?
-Yeah.

15:47.626 --> 15:50.087
She said something about Mrs. G.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.458
Oh, look how beautiful.

15:54.539 --> 15:56.455
There's some great
ones of Franny, too.

15:57.494 --> 15:59.701
But I couldn't seem
to find any of you.

15:59.991 --> 16:01.930
You were such a
tiny little thing,

16:02.030 --> 16:03.863
so much smaller
than Franny and I.

16:03.924 --> 16:07.098
-Was I?
-You almost looked like a little boy.

16:07.821 --> 16:09.179
-What?
-So afraid

16:09.262 --> 16:11.032
that you barely said two words.

16:32.090 --> 16:32.841
Huh.

16:39.078 --> 16:40.508
I didn't know you were here.

16:42.799 --> 16:45.199
'Hello, Mother.'
'Hello, Jennifer.'

16:45.896 --> 16:48.291
Looking for pictures from '73.

16:48.351 --> 16:50.630
Not in that book. Here.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.043
Oh. Yeah.

17:00.222 --> 17:01.025
Look at me.

17:01.348 --> 17:03.894
No, no, no, that's later.
That's '75.

17:04.013 --> 17:06.378
You were already 15
here in this picture.

17:06.835 --> 17:08.567
Let me show you 13.

17:09.624 --> 17:10.175
There.

17:12.704 --> 17:14.046
That's 13.

17:20.275 --> 17:21.412
I was so little.

17:22.326 --> 17:22.931
Yeah.

17:41.196 --> 17:43.218
Why are you telling
this story, Jenny?

17:43.519 --> 17:45.826
I always wanted to
have a story to tell,

17:46.842 --> 17:48.925
but nothing ever
happened to me before.

17:56.134 --> 17:58.052
Ah... It's hot. Be careful.

17:59.254 --> 18:01.017
Don't tell anyone.
It's our secret.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.290
-Mom, can I say it?
-Raymond!

18:03.526 --> 18:05.567
Bless us, Lord,

18:05.789 --> 18:08.412
and these gifts that
we're about to eat.

18:08.579 --> 18:10.268
Thank you for friends...

18:10.329 --> 18:12.249
I'd like to begin this story

18:12.983 --> 18:15.414
by telling you
something so beautiful.

18:18.854 --> 18:19.890
Wakey-wakey!

18:21.205 --> 18:22.330
Time to run.

18:24.164 --> 18:26.253
Meet outside in 10 minutes.
No stragglers.

18:30.566 --> 18:34.388
She was the most beautiful
woman I had ever met.

18:35.883 --> 18:38.045
Every girl wanted
to be just like her.

18:40.155 --> 18:41.616
Becky and Franny did.

18:43.144 --> 18:43.939
I did.

18:44.569 --> 18:45.897
Good morning.

18:47.295 --> 18:50.360
We'll be running every morning
before our first ride, with Bill.

18:50.872 --> 18:51.931
You're very lucky.

18:52.258 --> 18:54.147
Bill is an excellent coach.

18:54.544 --> 18:57.591
He will teach you to go beyond
the complaints of your bodies.

18:58.249 --> 19:00.539
Running gives us stamina.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.779
Makes us into excellent riders.

19:10.549 --> 19:11.416
Good morning.

19:11.503 --> 19:12.949
Good morning, girls.

19:13.010 --> 19:15.001
-This is Franny...
-Hi. Bill.

19:15.062 --> 19:16.636
-Becky...
-Hi.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.373
And Jenny.

19:18.193 --> 19:19.297
I'm so happy to meet you.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.142
Jane has already told
me a lot about you.

19:21.503 --> 19:22.910
So, here we go.

19:23.104 --> 19:25.283
Jane, why don't you run
scout, I'll run gunner.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.789
We'll see how everyone does,

19:26.877 --> 19:28.114
and then we'll switch
it up in the middle.

19:28.175 --> 19:30.265
-Come along, girls!
-All right.

19:33.201 --> 19:35.437
I am Nouga and you are Neets!

19:35.497 --> 19:37.425
When I say Nouga, you say Neets!

19:37.486 --> 19:38.788
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:38.849 --> 19:40.140
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:40.201 --> 19:41.602
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:41.663 --> 19:43.214
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:43.274 --> 19:44.837
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:44.898 --> 19:45.924
Okay, Franny,
you're doing great.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.333
-Just walk for a few minutes.
-Okay.

19:47.647 --> 19:48.292
Jane?

19:50.024 --> 19:51.008
Good girl, Jenny.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.839
I'll walk with them.
Meet you at the top.

19:53.911 --> 19:55.199
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:55.260 --> 19:56.453
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:56.514 --> 19:58.012
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:58.073 --> 19:59.482
-Nouga!
-Neets!

19:59.543 --> 20:00.948
-Nouga!
-Neets!

20:01.009 --> 20:02.559
-Nouga!
-Neets!

20:06.729 --> 20:07.337
Martin?

20:23.353 --> 20:24.173
Franny?

20:35.772 --> 20:37.862
Funny how you live with
people in your mind.

20:40.033 --> 20:42.127
Inside of you, they're
always the same.

20:44.722 --> 20:46.249
And you live with them happily.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.515
Never wanting
anything to change.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.655
As documentarians,

21:25.167 --> 21:27.765
you all have been developing

21:27.826 --> 21:29.696
your own unique skills,

21:29.792 --> 21:31.824
unconsciously,
since you were born.

21:32.741 --> 21:34.875
I'll speak from my experience.

21:35.549 --> 21:38.247
I was a super-shy kid.

21:38.307 --> 21:41.366
I felt invisible.

21:41.971 --> 21:43.605
At home, at school.

21:43.763 --> 21:46.510
So I learned to adapt.

21:46.671 --> 21:50.743
I taught myself the skill
of being a chameleon

21:51.466 --> 21:53.241
so that I could fit into...

21:53.674 --> 21:55.632
people's worlds,
their environment...

21:56.649 --> 21:57.868
and have some friends.

21:59.706 --> 22:00.653
Let's try something.

22:02.306 --> 22:05.243
Joe, how would you like
to be a guinea pig today?

22:05.304 --> 22:06.104
Sure.

22:06.261 --> 22:07.694
Everybody say hi to Joe.

22:07.809 --> 22:09.758
Hey, Joe.

22:10.442 --> 22:14.054
So, we learn about the truth

22:14.334 --> 22:17.000
by reading people, right?

22:17.499 --> 22:19.556
It's how we get to know them.

22:21.082 --> 22:22.276
So, what about Joe?

22:23.149 --> 22:25.197
His body language...
It's defensive.

22:25.377 --> 22:26.995
Well, you're...

22:27.708 --> 22:30.240
Let's change it up, Joe. All
right, so there's a point.

22:30.661 --> 22:32.727
We learn a lot from
people's bodies.

22:32.788 --> 22:34.801
They tell us a lot. So
let's keep investigating.

22:34.862 --> 22:35.495
What else?

22:35.812 --> 22:37.484
Are you depressed, Joe?

22:39.218 --> 22:39.762
No.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.447
Do we believe Joe?

22:41.746 --> 22:42.955
Do you believe yourself?

22:43.497 --> 22:44.634
A little bit.

22:45.150 --> 22:47.264
So, good point. So that means...

22:47.680 --> 22:49.040
he didn't tell you the truth.

22:49.719 --> 22:50.447
Right?

22:51.227 --> 22:53.318
So how do we get to know?

22:53.379 --> 22:56.069
How do we go beyond what
the person is telling us?

22:56.926 --> 22:58.162
-Yeah?
-How do we know when

22:58.223 --> 22:59.040
we've crossed the boundary?

22:59.820 --> 23:02.367
Excuse me. One second, guys.
Sorry.

23:02.951 --> 23:04.214
Keep talking to Joe.

23:07.698 --> 23:08.813
Hey, Franny?

23:08.874 --> 23:10.451
Jenny Fox, is that you?

23:10.512 --> 23:12.356
Hi! How good to hear from you.

23:12.416 --> 23:14.021
So surprised to
get your message.

23:14.081 --> 23:14.970
Yeah!

23:15.031 --> 23:16.696
What happened to
your outside leg?

23:16.867 --> 23:17.716
-Hello?
-Yeah.

23:17.777 --> 23:19.193
You know, the other left one?

23:19.938 --> 23:21.069
Are you talking to me?

23:21.199 --> 23:23.275
Sorry, I'm in the
middle of work.

23:23.493 --> 23:25.635
-Where are you?
-Oh, you don't know?

23:25.695 --> 23:27.985
I manage Mrs. G's farm.
Have for years.

23:28.067 --> 23:29.311
Oh, wow, I didn't...

23:29.460 --> 23:30.959
No, I didn't know.

23:31.553 --> 23:32.864
-Oh.
-It would just...

23:32.925 --> 23:35.550
It would be so
amazing to come visit

23:35.611 --> 23:37.627
and maybe see you and Mrs. G.

23:37.957 --> 23:38.988
Do you still ride?

23:40.634 --> 23:41.818
-Jenny?
-Um...

23:43.129 --> 23:45.191
not as much as I used to.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.798
They invited me to lunch.

23:51.004 --> 23:52.087
Are you wearing a wire?

23:52.148 --> 23:54.583
-What? No.
-Oh, you should have a wire.

23:55.126 --> 23:57.111
I thought Martin was
gonna to help you, no?

23:57.848 --> 23:59.494
You have to record everything.

24:00.223 --> 24:01.226
Mom, no.

24:01.286 --> 24:02.660
Martin's not gonna help me,

24:02.743 --> 24:05.162
and I'd be way too
nervous to wear a wire.

24:05.407 --> 24:07.464
Just tell me you're
gonna ask about Bill.

24:09.187 --> 24:11.249
I don't know. I'm
gonna play it by ear.

24:11.376 --> 24:13.916
Okay, but don't forget...
Tempus fugit.

24:14.159 --> 24:15.781
What does that even mean?

24:15.939 --> 24:17.393
You took Latin, look it up.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.654
No, Ma, that was one
of your other kids.

24:19.715 --> 24:21.173
Oh, who could keep track?

24:21.545 --> 24:22.743
Okay, bye.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.667
Right, girls. Here we go now.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.277
-Now you missed a spot.
-Sorry, Mrs. G.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.654
You can do better than that.

24:37.331 --> 24:38.078
See here.

24:38.262 --> 24:39.159
-Finish.
-Mm-hm.

24:39.381 --> 24:40.070
Good girl.

24:47.867 --> 24:48.729
What's going on here?

24:59.398 --> 25:00.605
Sorry, Mrs. G.

25:02.051 --> 25:03.162
No excuses.

25:04.102 --> 25:04.827
Come on.

25:25.627 --> 25:27.720
Mrs. G, Franny.

25:28.424 --> 25:29.852
So good to see you.

25:30.369 --> 25:31.929
That coat.

25:32.001 --> 25:34.831
I feel like I remember
from years past.

25:35.061 --> 25:36.193
It's ancient.

25:36.538 --> 25:38.204
Ah, here are our drinks.

25:39.547 --> 25:40.908
What are we having, Fran?

25:41.132 --> 25:42.153
Uh, yeah.

25:42.313 --> 25:45.545
Okay, Mary, Mother will
have the onion soup...

25:46.215 --> 25:48.113
You know, I have
a lot of regrets.

25:49.131 --> 25:49.829
You do?

25:51.640 --> 25:54.128
I would change so many things
if I could go back in time.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.222
What would you change?

25:56.546 --> 25:57.877
Jenny, you gonna eat?

25:58.876 --> 25:59.663
Uh...

25:59.907 --> 26:02.141
sorry, yeah, I'll just
have a mixed green salad.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.182
Thanks. Let's slow down, eh?

26:08.747 --> 26:11.085
I don't think I know
where you're from,

26:11.146 --> 26:12.347
or maybe I never knew.

26:12.408 --> 26:15.088
-But you're from London?
-No, West Country.

26:15.149 --> 26:16.454
I grew up on a farm.

26:17.241 --> 26:19.573
But my mum preferred
the dogs over me.

26:20.161 --> 26:23.078
I was taken away and put in a
children's home quite young.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.968
Right out of Dickens.

26:26.409 --> 26:27.955
I've been wanting to ask you...

26:28.016 --> 26:29.844
Better just get it over with.

26:30.673 --> 26:31.880
No need to wallow.

26:33.311 --> 26:35.275
Ray passed away two years ago.

26:35.878 --> 26:37.408
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:38.070 --> 26:41.259
Dr. G has cancer. He's lived
with it for a long time.

26:41.549 --> 26:43.064
No one thought he
would live this long.

26:45.922 --> 26:46.809
So there.

26:47.047 --> 26:48.153
You know everything.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.693
Now we can change the subject.

26:58.014 --> 27:01.523
It's funny, I didn't even
think about asking about Dr. G.

27:01.739 --> 27:02.891
I feel bad. I just...

27:02.952 --> 27:04.534
I assumed they were divorced.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.088
Why would you say that?

27:06.520 --> 27:09.376
She and Dr. G are absolutely
devoted to one another.

27:11.356 --> 27:12.055
Right.

27:12.407 --> 27:14.447
But what about Bill?

27:15.148 --> 27:16.509
What happened to him?

27:17.524 --> 27:18.680
I don't know what
happened to him.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.173
I don't have any idea.

27:24.385 --> 27:25.941
Why am I doing this?

27:26.002 --> 27:27.695
Don't question yourself now.

27:27.756 --> 27:29.226
You're doing everything right.

27:30.255 --> 27:32.046
I said I wanted a riding lesson.

27:32.129 --> 27:34.443
Oh, that's smart.
Build a rapport.

27:34.583 --> 27:35.881
Connect at her level.

27:36.647 --> 27:39.138
I don't know, what if
she finds out I'm lying?

27:39.199 --> 27:41.213
I mean, I haven't ridden
since I was a kid.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.175
It's just like
riding a bike, honey.

27:43.236 --> 27:45.150
You'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.

27:45.313 --> 27:47.110
She's an old woman.

27:48.421 --> 27:51.013
She's broken, you know?

27:51.074 --> 27:52.495
She's different than you,

27:53.888 --> 27:55.209
and she's had a hard life.

27:55.269 --> 27:57.022
We've all had a hard life.

27:57.168 --> 28:00.664
She looks nothing like
I remember, you know?

28:02.391 --> 28:05.140
Like, she looked like
such a giant to me then.

28:20.962 --> 28:23.033
You must push yourselves
beyond all boundaries.

28:23.705 --> 28:24.554
No limits!

28:26.618 --> 28:29.574
My mom said Ray isn't
even Dr. G's kid.

28:29.870 --> 28:30.721
She's divorced.

28:30.781 --> 28:32.318
You don't know what
you're talking about.

28:32.781 --> 28:34.318
Her first husband
killed himself.

28:58.796 --> 29:01.024
The day before the
final competition,

29:01.492 --> 29:03.600
Mrs. G gave us a
break from training.

29:05.893 --> 29:06.890
Five...

29:07.519 --> 29:08.746
Jenny, come join us.

29:08.807 --> 29:10.038
Yeah, come on in, Jenny.

29:11.782 --> 29:13.113
Nouga, over here!

29:18.438 --> 29:20.732
Nouga promised to
come watch me ride.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.545
Why did we call him Nouga?

29:25.323 --> 29:26.379
What does that mean?

29:27.165 --> 29:28.119
Nothing. I don't know.

29:29.048 --> 29:30.055
I never asked him.

29:36.745 --> 29:38.535
Don't you think it's
a little cult-like?

29:39.676 --> 29:40.288
No?

29:42.874 --> 29:43.605
What?

29:43.974 --> 29:45.784
I mean, I didn't
think it at the time.

29:45.845 --> 29:47.983
But now, in retrospect...

29:48.741 --> 29:50.239
you know, the whole group thing.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.185
Worshipping pain. Endurance.

29:53.870 --> 29:55.799
It's a bit religious,
don't you think?

29:55.968 --> 29:56.760
Really?

29:59.572 --> 30:00.430
Really, Jenny?

30:05.441 --> 30:07.236
I expected so much more of you.

30:11.258 --> 30:12.727
-Hey, Jenny.
-Oh!

30:14.600 --> 30:16.525
-Hey.
-Find it okay?

30:16.603 --> 30:17.831
Franny, whoa.

30:18.557 --> 30:19.441
She's out back.

30:19.610 --> 30:20.817
Okay.

30:22.039 --> 30:23.819
Yes, you're a beauty.

30:28.916 --> 30:29.618
Come on.

30:33.008 --> 30:34.406
Hello, Mrs. G.

30:34.758 --> 30:36.894
Let's get you up in the saddle
and see what you can do.

30:36.954 --> 30:38.130
Hope you don't
end up in the dirt

30:38.191 --> 30:39.503
like last time we saw you.

30:39.617 --> 30:41.251
Whoa, hold up.

30:41.312 --> 30:42.407
Hold up there.

30:42.668 --> 30:44.629
I don't know. He is huge.

30:44.696 --> 30:45.907
This one's a shark.

30:45.968 --> 30:47.277
Oh, what a shark.

30:47.707 --> 30:49.360
But how the shark can move.

30:50.804 --> 30:53.400
-It's been a while.
-Oh, nonsense.

30:53.893 --> 30:54.691
You ready?

30:54.816 --> 30:55.647
Okay.

31:00.282 --> 31:01.435
There we go.

31:02.554 --> 31:04.880
Mr. Shark's got
perfect conformation,

31:05.190 --> 31:06.512
but he was too
small for breeding,

31:06.573 --> 31:08.083
so they cut him and
put him up for sale.

31:08.144 --> 31:10.282
He's a giant. Let's
see if I can do this.

31:14.891 --> 31:15.958
Okay...

31:18.489 --> 31:20.820
He needs contact with
your hands to feel you.

31:20.903 --> 31:23.675
I haven't ridden in a while,
so maybe a calmer horse?

31:23.736 --> 31:26.198
Nonsense. Now,
remember the position.

31:26.616 --> 31:28.755
Heels down, head
up like a queen.

31:30.813 --> 31:31.806
Arms down, Jenny.

31:31.867 --> 31:33.995
You know, quiet
hands, quiet horse.

31:36.418 --> 31:37.578
Hands down, Jenny.

31:37.733 --> 31:40.134
Quiet hands, quiet horse.
You know this.

31:40.195 --> 31:41.751
Yes, Mrs. G.

31:44.308 --> 31:47.730
I'd love to be in that daydream.
It looks lovely in there.

31:49.333 --> 31:49.977
Is it nice?

31:51.159 --> 31:52.081
Yes!

31:52.142 --> 31:53.818
Okay, well that horse
needs you to be present.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.219
-Let's go.
-Okay, Mrs. G.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.673
Okay, Mrs. G.

31:58.752 --> 31:59.930
He can't feel you, Jenny,

31:59.990 --> 32:01.593
he can't know what
you're asking for.

32:02.034 --> 32:03.260
You are a beauty.

32:04.029 --> 32:06.109
You look beautiful.
You are a beauty.

32:08.446 --> 32:09.740
Good girl. Better.

32:11.655 --> 32:12.578
Canter now.

32:12.905 --> 32:14.038
No excuses.

32:14.572 --> 32:15.778
Canter now.

32:17.812 --> 32:18.827
Canter now.

32:20.803 --> 32:23.374
The body remembers everything.
It really does.

32:24.434 --> 32:25.888
Good girl, Jenny!

32:27.200 --> 32:29.698
Let's go! Take that jump again.

32:32.774 --> 32:33.416
Come on.

32:40.391 --> 32:42.585
I... I'm sorry, I don't
know what happened.

32:42.646 --> 32:44.228
No fretting. No, it's fine.

32:44.636 --> 32:46.111
Get right back on that horse.

32:46.803 --> 32:47.657
Here we go.

32:48.131 --> 32:49.009
Good girl.

32:49.502 --> 32:50.162
Up.

32:51.678 --> 32:52.596
There we go.

32:53.495 --> 32:54.479
Take a breath.

32:55.060 --> 32:55.792
Okay.

32:58.455 --> 32:59.792
Want you to use this.

33:00.557 --> 33:02.517
We don't want that horse
getting any bad habits, do we?

33:03.430 --> 33:06.419
No bad horses, only bad riders.

33:07.563 --> 33:10.897
There are no bad horses,
only bad riders. Right?

33:11.088 --> 33:13.398
-Yes, Mrs. G.
-Okay, let's take it again.

33:15.496 --> 33:16.988
Back on the rein-in, girls.

33:18.389 --> 33:19.551
Let's canter, please.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.413
Want you to take
that jump again.

33:24.294 --> 33:26.606
Thank you so much
for joining us today

33:26.666 --> 33:29.917
for our final demonstration of
the girls' summer intensive.

33:30.555 --> 33:32.146
Today, they will
be mock competing

33:32.228 --> 33:33.621
in three very demanding events.

33:33.682 --> 33:35.791
So let's wish them
all good luck.

33:39.781 --> 33:42.695
Jenny. Jenny, your
mother just called me.

33:42.778 --> 33:44.490
Your sister's broken her arm.

33:46.273 --> 33:48.561
Okay. I'm fine.

33:48.622 --> 33:50.528
They won't be able to
pick you up till tomorrow.

34:36.155 --> 34:37.446
Go, Jenny!

35:16.117 --> 35:17.797
Bill and I want to take
you out for dinner.

35:19.769 --> 35:20.637
Now?

35:22.222 --> 35:23.075
Yeah.

35:24.018 --> 35:25.884
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, you hungry?

35:26.295 --> 35:28.681
-Yeah!
-Come on. I'm starving.

35:32.923 --> 35:35.366
The guy from Geralyn
Hall left a message

35:35.588 --> 35:37.398
saying they're
booked all of July.

35:37.653 --> 35:38.616
But I think you should call him.

35:38.677 --> 35:41.050
You know, you talk
people into anything.

35:41.555 --> 35:42.487
Oh, yeah?

35:44.520 --> 35:45.997
Do I talk you into everything?

35:46.058 --> 35:47.868
Look at what I'm doing. Cooking.

35:48.357 --> 35:49.845
Chili powder, maybe?

35:49.906 --> 35:50.847
-For a little...
-Yes.

35:51.057 --> 35:52.169
Yes, that would be great.

35:52.230 --> 35:53.983
-pinch.
-I'll work the chili powder.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.819
So how was...

35:56.008 --> 35:58.155
How was the hall you
went to see this weekend?

36:01.866 --> 36:03.336
It's supposed to be a good one.

36:04.269 --> 36:05.478
I'm excited about it.

36:05.796 --> 36:08.849
# If I could read
your mind, love #

36:09.222 --> 36:12.341
# What a tale your
thoughts could tell #

36:13.183 --> 36:16.472
# Just like a paperback novel #

36:17.351 --> 36:20.244
# The kind that
drug stores sell #

36:20.908 --> 36:22.985
# When you reach the part #

36:23.459 --> 36:25.810
# Where the heartaches come #

36:25.937 --> 36:29.045
# The hero would be me #

36:35.364 --> 36:36.219
There you go.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.474
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

36:38.494 --> 36:40.401
I have been very impressed

36:40.461 --> 36:41.958
with your running
this summer, Jenny.

36:43.301 --> 36:44.027
Really.

36:44.517 --> 36:46.007
But I want you to consider

36:46.480 --> 36:48.249
joining my inner-city
running team

36:48.310 --> 36:49.777
when you come back
from vacation.

36:50.133 --> 36:50.926
You serious?

36:50.987 --> 36:52.176
I am serious.

36:52.308 --> 36:53.295
You have talent.

36:53.775 --> 36:55.596
And, more importantly,
you have guts.

36:55.657 --> 36:57.803
Without guts, talent is wasted.

36:58.747 --> 36:59.392
Yeah.

36:59.543 --> 37:01.083
Strong body, strong mind.

37:01.326 --> 37:02.239
-Yeah.
-Say it.

37:03.013 --> 37:05.501
-Strong body, strong mind.
-There you go.

37:08.699 --> 37:09.633
It's just...

37:09.705 --> 37:11.102
It's just so hard to leave.

37:13.563 --> 37:15.458
You'll be all right.
You'll be fine.

37:18.528 --> 37:20.522
Jane tells me that you're
quite a storyteller.

37:21.110 --> 37:22.242
Do you know I write, too?

37:22.773 --> 37:23.960
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

37:24.183 --> 37:24.907
Poetry.

37:27.882 --> 37:29.715
Can I write you when
I'm on vacation?

37:30.002 --> 37:31.565
-I'd love that.
-We would love that.

37:33.043 --> 37:33.876
You can write us

37:33.937 --> 37:35.384
and you can tell us
anything you want.

37:35.445 --> 37:36.304
Anything.

37:36.729 --> 37:38.341
There are no secrets
at this table.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.921
And we don't want to keep
any secrets from you, either.

37:43.047 --> 37:44.587
Jane and I have talked,

37:45.034 --> 37:48.254
and we've decided that we
want us all to be equals.

37:48.315 --> 37:50.212
And we respect you
too much to lie.

37:52.031 --> 37:55.339
So we want you to know
that Jane and I are lovers.

38:00.112 --> 38:01.070
How do you feel?

38:02.330 --> 38:04.011
Well, I'm happy for you.

38:04.535 --> 38:06.055
I'm happy you have each other.

38:07.444 --> 38:09.709
I don't want you to be
miserable like my parents.

38:09.965 --> 38:11.833
-You see?
-Dear girl.

38:12.570 --> 38:14.197
Told you she has a deep soul.

38:17.101 --> 38:20.000
How did they know they could
trust me with their secret?

38:20.670 --> 38:23.108
That I would never
break their confidence?

38:23.572 --> 38:25.445
The other girls would
have told on them.

38:26.382 --> 38:28.383
I would never tell my parents,

38:28.571 --> 38:30.183
or the other adults.

38:30.754 --> 38:32.906
It was like an unspoken oath.

38:33.950 --> 38:35.469
And I felt proud of it.

38:36.196 --> 38:37.425
What are you doing now?

38:37.908 --> 38:38.908
Hey.

38:39.601 --> 38:41.680
They sent me a bunch of letters.

38:44.074 --> 38:46.341
Where's the rest of
the stuff from my room?

38:46.565 --> 38:48.078
Letters are in this box.

38:54.525 --> 38:55.357
Mom,

38:56.061 --> 38:58.112
how long did you
know these were here?

38:58.730 --> 39:00.545
How come you didn't
give me these before?

39:00.606 --> 39:02.722
I found them when
I found your story.

39:03.628 --> 39:05.663
And I didn't give
them to you because...

39:08.166 --> 39:09.300
Because I was ashamed.

39:10.950 --> 39:12.364
'My Dear Jenny,'

39:13.446 --> 39:14.701
'I was so sad...

39:16.087 --> 39:17.446
reading your special letters...'

39:17.507 --> 39:18.793
I hate being home.

39:19.946 --> 39:22.093
Even in this beautiful place,

39:22.851 --> 39:25.701
my brothers and sisters
never stop fighting.

39:27.118 --> 39:28.495
My mom and grandmother

39:28.842 --> 39:30.324
yell at them constantly.

39:30.407 --> 39:33.196
'It's easier to be
unhappy in this world.

39:33.332 --> 39:34.942
'It has been burned
into my brain

39:35.003 --> 39:38.039
'that it is I that is selfish.

39:38.690 --> 39:39.981
I take, they give.'

39:40.098 --> 39:41.288
'My dear Jenny,

39:41.349 --> 39:42.957
'Nouga and I shared
our cards from you,

39:43.018 --> 39:44.807
'your poems of pathos.
I hope you don't mind.

39:45.011 --> 39:47.250
'You have some very special
kind of beauty, Jenny,

39:47.311 --> 39:48.621
and it's natural to
want to share...'

39:48.681 --> 39:49.801
I'm so confused.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.434
But at the same time,

39:52.127 --> 39:53.522
I feel free.

39:53.682 --> 39:56.357
It's getting to where one
can't walk in broad daylight.

39:57.038 --> 39:59.488
And that one goes running
around at all hours.

40:00.169 --> 40:03.126
A woman was raped last
year over on Spencer.

40:03.616 --> 40:04.772
What are you going on about?

40:06.166 --> 40:08.039
Jenny, can you go
get your brother?

40:08.100 --> 40:08.911
It's time for dinner.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.306
We talked about this.

40:11.771 --> 40:13.890
I will not have your mother
instilling fear in my children.

40:13.951 --> 40:15.277
Can you just keep
your voice down?

40:15.441 --> 40:17.171
She gave up her
summer to help me.

40:17.232 --> 40:18.738
This is still my house.

40:18.872 --> 40:19.381
I-I know...

40:19.634 --> 40:21.085
Jenny, I feel for you.

40:22.783 --> 40:24.457
Growth always means change.

40:24.727 --> 40:25.827
But then Nouga says

40:25.888 --> 40:27.607
change is almost always painful,

40:27.668 --> 40:28.855
and thus pain is joy.

40:29.413 --> 40:30.411
So we smile again.

40:30.719 --> 40:31.718
Dear Jenny,

40:32.358 --> 40:33.897
try to continue
with your running.

40:34.515 --> 40:37.083
Before long, the pleasure of
doing it will appear again.

40:38.494 --> 40:41.386
Each day, the well-done piece
will build your confidence.

40:42.415 --> 40:44.121
Is your horse a boy or a girl?

40:44.335 --> 40:45.211
It's a boy.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.577
-It's a beautiful horse.
-Thanks.

40:47.921 --> 40:50.537
So glad you've made a new
friend, my dear Jenny.

40:50.831 --> 40:53.759
This wonderful experience
will only open new worlds

40:53.820 --> 40:54.636
for you to come.

40:55.663 --> 40:56.809
But do not rush.

40:57.175 --> 41:00.055
You have plenty of time
to enjoy everything.

41:00.479 --> 41:02.210
Mom? Dad? Are you in there?

41:05.588 --> 41:06.920
Would you keep it down, please?

41:06.989 --> 41:08.633
Your father and I are
trying to take a nap.

41:08.694 --> 41:10.387
Sorry, Mom, but
it's very important.

41:10.770 --> 41:13.379
My friend, well, he
invited me to the fair.

41:13.439 --> 41:14.210
We'll be back by 9:00.

41:14.271 --> 41:15.570
Wait, who invited you?

41:15.631 --> 41:19.136
A new friend from the stable.
Lucas Mendelssohn.

41:19.197 --> 41:21.527
-His family's from Texas.
-Of course not, Jenny.

41:21.677 --> 41:23.784
We don't know his family,
and you know the rule.

41:23.962 --> 41:25.809
You know we have dinner
reservations with the Wheelers.

41:25.870 --> 41:26.875
Now go get dressed.

41:26.936 --> 41:28.357
He's flying home with
his family tomorrow.

41:28.418 --> 41:29.846
Please? We'll be
back right at 9:00.

41:29.907 --> 41:31.428
I don't want to repeat myself.

41:31.645 --> 41:33.821
And you heard your father.
This is an important dinner.

41:33.935 --> 41:35.384
Your dad's gonna
close the financing

41:35.445 --> 41:37.431
on the new development,
so go get dressed.

41:48.336 --> 41:49.705
They said I can't go.

41:49.766 --> 41:51.468
Well, maybe my mom
can call your mom.

41:51.963 --> 41:53.065
But it won't matter.

41:54.848 --> 41:57.113
It's just one of
their stupid rules.

41:59.435 --> 42:00.149
I hate them.

42:03.144 --> 42:04.056
Young lady.

42:04.966 --> 42:06.209
What did we just discuss?

42:51.774 --> 42:53.614
Babes. Babe?

42:54.246 --> 42:55.733
Come on, let's go. We're
all waiting in the car.

42:56.508 --> 42:57.751
I don't want to go.

42:58.250 --> 43:00.169
Honey, what was the
name of your friend?

43:00.230 --> 43:02.067
That boy, his family?
What was his name?

43:02.128 --> 43:03.959
-Mendelssohn.
-Mendelssohn.

43:04.627 --> 43:07.063
That's right. I knew
I knew the name.

43:08.051 --> 43:09.907
I played golf with his
father two weeks ago.

43:09.968 --> 43:11.226
Joel Stern brought
him to the club.

43:12.202 --> 43:14.129
Anyway, come on. Move it.
Let's go.

43:21.006 --> 43:22.661
I have made a decision.

43:24.742 --> 43:27.306
I'm taking my life
into my own hands.

43:33.635 --> 43:34.659
That fall,

43:35.392 --> 43:36.575
every Friday,

43:36.865 --> 43:38.746
my dad picked me up from school

43:39.139 --> 43:41.211
and dropped me off at Mrs. G's.

43:41.294 --> 43:42.296
Hi, my love.

43:43.271 --> 43:44.261
Let me look at you.

43:46.580 --> 43:48.121
Someone's kept up
with her training.

44:00.031 --> 44:01.673
I have made a decision.

44:02.574 --> 44:05.017
I'm taking my life
in my own hands.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.060
That fall,

44:08.576 --> 44:11.430
every Friday, Mrs. G
picked me up from school,

44:12.077 --> 44:13.569
and took me to her farm.

44:22.097 --> 44:23.776
It was pure bliss.

44:25.090 --> 44:26.296
It was heaven.

44:28.091 --> 44:29.591
I was finally home.

44:30.254 --> 44:31.532
I was finally home.

44:32.688 --> 44:35.188
We tell ourselves
stories in order to live.

44:36.098 --> 44:37.273
So, what's your story?

44:39.058 --> 44:40.660
What story are you gonna tell?

44:47.520 --> 44:48.463
Thank you.

45:02.646 --> 45:04.011
I think we should
tell your parents

45:04.072 --> 45:05.731
about visiting
Bill at his house.

45:06.324 --> 45:07.649
What do you think?

45:07.812 --> 45:09.348
I don't think they'd understand.

45:10.902 --> 45:13.690
Ha! They don't
understand anything.

45:41.104 --> 45:42.723
It's like if I was invisible.

45:43.897 --> 45:46.222
Like if I didn't even exist.

45:46.336 --> 45:50.059
Well, your parents are
just afraid of the world.

45:51.788 --> 45:54.785
They're just afraid of
living, of being free.

45:55.752 --> 45:58.904
They cannot accept that
you are becoming a woman.

45:59.730 --> 46:02.162
They can't see you
the way that we can.

46:02.530 --> 46:03.813
They're such hypocrites.

46:04.676 --> 46:05.764
I hate them.

46:05.825 --> 46:07.195
You shouldn't hate them, Jenny.

46:07.834 --> 46:09.249
You should pity them.

46:09.579 --> 46:11.735
They're just not
brave like you are.

46:12.552 --> 46:13.697
You're not afraid of life.

46:13.862 --> 46:16.348
Right Jenny? You're
not afraid of living.

46:18.790 --> 46:19.938
How about this?

46:20.771 --> 46:23.113
We will form our own family

46:23.174 --> 46:26.054
based on complete honesty

46:27.218 --> 46:27.943
and love.

46:29.333 --> 46:30.505
Hiding nothing,

46:31.193 --> 46:32.412
revealing everything.

46:32.628 --> 46:33.651
Just the truth.

46:34.722 --> 46:36.479
And we'll never
lie to each other.

46:36.761 --> 46:37.606
Never.

46:38.027 --> 46:39.699
Like the rest of the world does.

46:39.807 --> 46:41.097
That's exactly right.

46:42.935 --> 46:45.726
I have to go. We have to go.
Come on, missus.

46:45.787 --> 46:47.129
I haven't even made dinner.

46:47.564 --> 46:50.230
When it came time to
leave, we had to hurry.

46:50.392 --> 46:52.444
You know how he gets when
he hasn't got his dinner.

46:52.517 --> 46:55.260
Dr. G always got mad
if we came home late.

46:56.054 --> 46:57.622
It's always you two going off.

46:58.465 --> 47:00.346
Jane, why doesn't Jenny
have dinner with me tonight?

47:01.458 --> 47:02.844
And that way we get a
little bit more time

47:02.905 --> 47:04.237
to talk about all this stuff?

47:04.696 --> 47:07.606
Then if it gets too late, you
can sleep in my son's old room

47:07.667 --> 47:09.776
and I'll bring her over
first thing tomorrow morning.

47:10.842 --> 47:11.807
How does that sound?

47:13.708 --> 47:14.908
It's not up to me.

47:15.782 --> 47:17.179
Jenny can make her own mind up.

47:18.565 --> 47:19.288
Can't you?

47:21.813 --> 47:22.494
Good.

47:23.703 --> 47:24.667
Then it's decided.

47:25.637 --> 47:26.827
What did I say?

47:27.032 --> 47:28.172
I have to go either way.

47:28.945 --> 47:30.145
I don't remember.

47:32.868 --> 47:34.657
I must have said something.

47:37.625 --> 47:39.112
I only remember them.

47:41.457 --> 47:43.270
Why can't I remember myself?

47:45.837 --> 47:47.359
Did I say yes?

47:50.748 --> 47:52.235
Why would you do that?

47:52.739 --> 47:53.267
Well...

47:55.396 --> 47:56.404
it's my life.

47:57.266 --> 47:58.732
I can make my own decisions.

48:00.126 --> 48:01.603
Really? You think so?

48:02.376 --> 48:02.895
Yeah.

48:03.063 --> 48:04.396
So, what did you say?

48:05.393 --> 48:06.638
Well, I said yes,

48:06.699 --> 48:10.372
because I want to prove to Bill
and Mrs. G that I'm mature.

48:10.457 --> 48:12.329
But that's not what you wrote.

48:12.903 --> 48:14.178
You wrote that you
don't want to be here.

48:14.239 --> 48:16.506
That you want to go back
with Mrs. G to her house.

48:17.224 --> 48:18.106
Look in your notebook.

48:18.323 --> 48:19.410
It's right there.

48:20.909 --> 48:22.504
That's just a fiction story.

48:22.565 --> 48:24.612
What do you mean fiction?
We wrote this as...

48:24.673 --> 48:26.589
It's a version of what happened.

48:26.649 --> 48:27.674
What does that mean?

48:28.323 --> 48:29.404
A lot of it's true.

48:29.818 --> 48:33.512
My teacher says that all stories
are based on the writer's life.

48:33.596 --> 48:35.344
You don't know what's
about to happen.

48:35.567 --> 48:37.642
I know Mrs. G much
better than Bill,

48:38.073 --> 48:40.697
but Bill is not gonna hurt me.

48:43.300 --> 48:44.795
-What if you're wrong?
-Stop!

48:44.856 --> 48:46.563
You've become just
like all of them.

48:46.741 --> 48:48.531
You just want to
tell me what to do.

48:48.702 --> 48:50.600
It's my life. Mine.

48:50.979 --> 48:51.938
Not yours.

48:52.855 --> 48:54.239
Let me live!

48:58.467 --> 48:59.527
What if you're wrong?

49:07.152 --> 49:08.905
I never saw a gold medal before.

49:09.723 --> 49:11.686
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah.

49:12.382 --> 49:13.089
Watch out!

49:15.971 --> 49:18.872
I picked out a book of poetry
that I wanted to show you.

49:18.942 --> 49:20.080
It's Rumi.

49:25.376 --> 49:26.782
I have wanted to show you this

49:26.842 --> 49:28.929
since the first time
I read your writing,

49:28.990 --> 49:31.652
because it reminded me of you.

49:32.953 --> 49:33.675
Really?

49:35.820 --> 49:36.565
You'll see.

49:36.666 --> 49:37.528
Okay...

49:38.906 --> 49:39.574
here we go.

49:41.039 --> 49:42.289
Start there,

49:43.081 --> 49:44.261
and just read it out loud.

49:45.843 --> 49:48.019
But I'm not a very good reader.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.372
Oh, I am sure you
read beautifully.

49:51.729 --> 49:52.345
Okay.

49:56.459 --> 50:00.092
'Make yourself free from
self at one stroke.'

50:01.951 --> 50:05.829
'Like a sword without
a trace of soft iron.

50:06.962 --> 50:08.721
'Like a steel mirror,

50:08.787 --> 50:10.903
scours off all rust
with contrition.'

50:10.964 --> 50:12.427
All rust with contrition.

50:12.765 --> 50:15.978
'That you may see your
own pure, bright essence.'

50:17.855 --> 50:21.294
Nouga, it's so beautiful.

50:21.900 --> 50:22.675
Yes.

50:23.215 --> 50:25.300
I just knew you would like it.
I just knew it.

50:28.587 --> 50:29.597
Jenny, are you cold?

50:30.117 --> 50:31.242
Your hands are trembling.

50:31.524 --> 50:33.949
Um, they always shake.

50:37.942 --> 50:40.314
I meant to light the fire,
but now it's too late.

50:43.621 --> 50:45.191
You shouldn't freeze.

50:46.168 --> 50:47.308
Are you feeling okay?

50:48.600 --> 50:49.454
Yeah.

50:49.580 --> 50:51.576
Maybe I should just
call Mrs. G...

50:51.637 --> 50:53.344
No, no, I'm okay.

50:53.435 --> 50:54.926
I... I feel fine.

50:55.681 --> 50:56.878
I don't want to go home.

50:57.798 --> 50:58.454
Look.

50:59.289 --> 51:02.761
Okay, well, then why don't
you read the other poem

51:03.098 --> 51:04.681
that's in there with
the page turned down.

51:05.307 --> 51:07.061
Yes! That's my favourite.

51:07.266 --> 51:08.067
'Call of Love.'

51:08.767 --> 51:10.574
And I'll be right back. I'm
going to get you a blanket.

51:10.860 --> 51:11.781
Um, okay.

51:13.862 --> 51:15.724
'At every instant

51:15.884 --> 51:17.454
'and from every side

51:18.012 --> 51:20.168
resounds the call of love.'

51:20.307 --> 51:21.332
I can't hear you!

51:23.338 --> 51:25.170
'We are going to heaven.

51:26.777 --> 51:28.402
'Who wants to come with us?

51:28.750 --> 51:30.832
'We have been the
friends of the angels.

51:30.965 --> 51:32.463
'We will go back there,

51:32.979 --> 51:34.359
for there is our country.'

51:35.700 --> 51:36.721
Okay, now move back.

51:39.895 --> 51:42.286
All right, you'll feel a
lot warmer in a second.

51:45.545 --> 51:46.668
How's that? Is that better?

51:47.100 --> 51:47.762
Yeah.

51:48.632 --> 51:50.387
'We are higher than heaven.'

51:51.818 --> 51:53.923
Okay, now scoot over.
I'm cold now.

51:56.199 --> 51:56.918
Don't stop.

51:57.682 --> 51:58.554
You're doing great.

52:01.090 --> 52:04.366
'More noble than the angels.

52:05.179 --> 52:06.332
'Why not go beyond them?

52:08.366 --> 52:10.673
-'Our goal...'
-Jenny, you are so special.

52:12.891 --> 52:13.736
Did you know that?

52:15.229 --> 52:16.401
You're so deep.

52:18.169 --> 52:21.397
'Our goal is the
supreme majesty.

52:22.016 --> 52:23.776
What has the fine pearl...'

52:23.837 --> 52:25.855
I want to save you
from all of those...

52:27.540 --> 52:29.638
stupid young boys out there.

52:31.558 --> 52:32.805
I think you are...

52:33.444 --> 52:34.318
perfect.

52:39.708 --> 52:40.991
'Why... Why have...'

52:41.052 --> 52:41.739
Jenny...

52:42.780 --> 52:44.225
would you do something for me?

52:46.923 --> 52:48.082
Would you let me see you?

52:49.835 --> 52:52.009
Will you just show me what
you look like without...?

52:53.542 --> 52:54.298
Okay.

52:55.624 --> 52:56.511
Are you shy?

52:58.046 --> 53:01.650
Do you think I want you to
have big breasts like Mrs. G?

53:03.654 --> 53:04.446
I don't.

53:06.299 --> 53:07.662
Do you want to take
your shirt off?

53:12.434 --> 53:13.143
Yeah?

53:14.768 --> 53:16.412
O... Okay.

53:16.483 --> 53:17.172
Okay.

53:28.523 --> 53:30.241
You've been preparing
for this moment.

53:31.568 --> 53:35.272
I don't think we should
tell Mrs. G about us.

53:35.333 --> 53:36.692
I don't think she's quite ready.

53:37.717 --> 53:39.088
Do you want to keep reading?

53:49.630 --> 53:50.698
Hey.

53:51.616 --> 53:53.075
Hey, what are you doing?

53:53.539 --> 53:54.486
What are you doing?

53:56.078 --> 53:58.876
What are you doing, reading
my childhood things?

53:59.074 --> 54:00.137
Who are they from?

54:01.007 --> 54:01.790
Who wrote them?

54:01.851 --> 54:03.788
From the relationship
I told you about.

54:03.849 --> 54:05.541
They're from an adult man.

54:05.602 --> 54:07.339
Yeah. I told you he was older.

54:07.400 --> 54:08.851
Just please don't go
through my things.

54:08.912 --> 54:10.935
I mean, how old was he?

54:10.996 --> 54:12.265
He's 40, I don't know.

54:12.775 --> 54:15.189
That's rape. That's illegal.

54:15.607 --> 54:16.320
Babe...

54:16.603 --> 54:19.713
How old were you? Like 13, 14?

54:19.774 --> 54:20.899
It was the '70s,

54:20.960 --> 54:22.745
and people didn't talk
about it like that.

54:23.312 --> 54:26.198
But babe the '70s,
'80s, it doesn't matter.

54:26.259 --> 54:27.767
I don't want you
to justify this.

54:27.849 --> 54:30.287
I'm not trying to
justify it, okay?

54:30.910 --> 54:34.749
It was my childhood, and
these things happened to me

54:34.810 --> 54:36.600
and it's just, you know,

54:36.760 --> 54:39.007
I'm just saying,
it was complicated.

54:39.506 --> 54:40.852
You talked about
the relationship,

54:40.913 --> 54:42.324
but this is a grown man.

54:42.879 --> 54:44.069
He was my coach.

54:44.130 --> 54:45.777
But what does that
have to do with it?

54:45.838 --> 54:48.142
He was 40 years old.
He was my age.

54:48.497 --> 54:50.027
Taking advantage of a child.

54:50.088 --> 54:50.642
Babe...

54:52.277 --> 54:53.911
this was important to me.

54:54.166 --> 54:56.463
And I'm trying to
figure out why, okay?

54:56.705 --> 54:58.060
These people were
important to me.

54:58.121 --> 54:59.401
People? Who are these people?

54:59.462 --> 55:02.755
I saw a letter from a woman.
Who was that?

55:02.816 --> 55:04.263
That was my riding teacher.

55:04.696 --> 55:06.665
She introduced him
to me, you know?

55:06.726 --> 55:08.968
And she was there that summer.

55:09.136 --> 55:11.141
-That's why I went to see her.
-But, you...

55:11.202 --> 55:12.414
I am trying to figure it out.

55:12.475 --> 55:14.314
Why do you want to find
them when you're the victim?

55:17.601 --> 55:18.925
I'm not saying that to...

55:19.009 --> 55:20.995
Okay, I am not a victim.

55:21.313 --> 55:26.066
I don't need you or anybody,
to call me a victim, okay?

55:26.221 --> 55:29.109
Because you don't have a
fucking clue about my life.

55:30.296 --> 55:32.012
So we need to stop this now.

55:34.094 --> 55:36.263
Let me just figure
this out for myself.

55:37.171 --> 55:38.737
Jennifer, I don't
know your life?

55:39.182 --> 55:40.617
After six years?

55:40.960 --> 55:43.484
Have you ever thought
about seeing a therapist?

55:43.545 --> 55:44.582
If you knew me,

55:44.792 --> 55:46.988
you'd know I ain't going
to see a therapist.

55:47.049 --> 55:48.823
I'm gonna figure
this out myself.

55:48.963 --> 55:51.122
Did you ever even look at
the ring I brought you?

55:51.183 --> 55:54.429
Do you think I give
a shit about a ring?

55:55.968 --> 55:58.107
That's you again,
not knowing me.

56:01.963 --> 56:02.997
Your car is here.

56:03.217 --> 56:05.486
I'm not going to leave
with us like this.

56:05.547 --> 56:06.651
I'm not going to.

56:07.005 --> 56:08.577
Look, Jennifer, let's...
Let's talk.

56:08.638 --> 56:11.402
-I want to be here for you...
-Please! Please! Please go.

56:14.327 --> 56:16.466
-I'm not leaving like this.
-Good! Then I'll leave.

56:16.652 --> 56:18.392
-So you stay.
-So... No, no, no.

56:18.453 --> 56:20.604
-You stay. No, you stay.
-All right, look,

56:20.665 --> 56:22.877
-you don't have to leave.
-And I'll get my shit together.

56:22.938 --> 56:24.722
I want you the fuck out of here!

56:25.577 --> 56:26.918
Go, or I go.

56:27.753 --> 56:28.674
Go, or I go.

56:39.433 --> 56:40.283
And when I come back,

56:40.344 --> 56:41.456
we're going to have
to talk about this.

56:58.648 --> 56:59.866
Why did you pick me?

57:00.460 --> 57:03.415
I'm a skinny, flat-chested,
introverted kid.

57:03.788 --> 57:04.595
You can't see yourself.

57:05.658 --> 57:06.976
I keep working on
your self-image,

57:07.037 --> 57:08.165
but you're so stubborn,

57:08.226 --> 57:09.561
so attached to your drama.

57:10.243 --> 57:11.764
Becky was so much prettier.

57:12.265 --> 57:14.086
Becky was closed off already.

57:15.198 --> 57:16.981
You're an adult now, Jenny.
You tell me.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.622
How do you find freshness
in the world of adults?

57:21.659 --> 57:23.089
Look at yourself. Look at me.

57:24.099 --> 57:25.633
Doubtful, jaded.

57:26.436 --> 57:29.314
Unable to be surprised.
I'm dying in my own skin.

57:33.231 --> 57:35.278
I wish you could see
yourself the way I see you.

57:37.108 --> 57:38.569
That earnestness,

57:38.802 --> 57:40.195
the devotion, the love.

57:40.960 --> 57:43.733
An adult cannot love like that.
Only children can.

57:44.580 --> 57:45.729
It's so pure.

57:45.790 --> 57:47.666
You still believe
in possibilities.

57:48.373 --> 57:49.081
As I do.

57:51.618 --> 57:53.067
As I do. See?

57:53.349 --> 57:54.764
Two peas in a pod?

57:54.825 --> 57:55.965
Yes, exactly.

57:58.215 --> 58:00.689
I hoped you would save
me from my family.

58:03.228 --> 58:03.987
Didn't I?

58:28.023 --> 58:29.817
God, I feel crazy.

58:32.493 --> 58:35.001
Maybe I'll get into
a crash and the...

58:36.004 --> 58:37.627
car'll catch on fire.

58:37.904 --> 58:39.943
The whole thing'll
go up in flames.

58:41.235 --> 58:43.191
All my secrets.

58:44.524 --> 58:46.749
History erased in a flash.

58:47.896 --> 58:48.916
Just like that.

59:18.639 --> 59:20.311
-Hello.
-Hi.

59:21.559 --> 59:22.919
You must be Mrs. Fox.

59:23.150 --> 59:23.703
Yes.

59:23.764 --> 59:25.410
How lovely to finally meet you.

59:26.759 --> 59:28.236
These are for you.

59:28.297 --> 59:29.219
Oh, thank you.

59:29.280 --> 59:32.373
And, uh, for your...
For your husband.

59:32.515 --> 59:34.000
-Oh. Um...
-I'm a big fan.

59:35.110 --> 59:37.810
Been following his progress
in the local papers.

59:38.421 --> 59:40.826
Jane wanted me to tell
you that she is so sorry

59:40.886 --> 59:42.692
that she couldn't
pick Jenny up tonight.

59:42.753 --> 59:44.669
Um, but she asked me to.

59:44.730 --> 59:46.501
This house is right on
my way home from work.

59:47.012 --> 59:49.883
I live across the field from
Mrs. Gramercy? She's...

59:50.502 --> 59:52.419
-You coach Jenny's running?
-Yes.

59:52.480 --> 59:53.742
-Please, Mom.
-Yes I do.

59:53.803 --> 59:55.177
She's a very talented runner.

59:55.238 --> 59:57.652
She shows a lot of promise.
You should be very proud.

59:57.808 --> 01:00:00.056
-I am proud.
-Okay...

01:00:00.117 --> 01:00:02.156
-Let's go.
-A wonderful, wonderful girl.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.852
All right, please tell
Mrs. Gramercy

01:00:04.913 --> 01:00:07.584
I'd like Jenny home
Sunday by 5:00 p.m sharp,

01:00:08.526 --> 01:00:09.754
so she can get
her homework done.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:10.627
Absolutely.

01:00:11.053 --> 01:00:13.419
One of us will have her
back in time Sunday night.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.060
-Okay, let's go.
-Don't have to worry.

01:00:15.121 --> 01:00:15.827
All right.

01:00:21.015 --> 01:00:22.242
Uh, bye.

01:00:49.432 --> 01:00:51.824
I find that I trust him so much,

01:00:53.214 --> 01:00:55.858
I never realize where
he's leading me.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:58.511
Just breathe.

01:01:07.277 --> 01:01:08.678
Once we're that far,

01:01:09.251 --> 01:01:10.985
I don't know how to say no.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.614
It's okay.

01:01:21.868 --> 01:01:23.004
I love him.

01:01:24.401 --> 01:01:25.538
He loves me.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.008
Not yet.

01:01:33.188 --> 01:01:35.656
We have to keep stretching
you open slowly.

01:01:37.923 --> 01:01:40.629
No young boy would
ever do this for you.

01:01:42.592 --> 01:01:43.620
But I'm not giving up.

01:01:44.106 --> 01:01:45.326
I'm ready for you.

01:02:46.324 --> 01:02:48.314
Ohh. Oh!

01:02:51.162 --> 01:02:52.152
Hey.

01:02:52.925 --> 01:02:53.885
Good morning.

01:02:53.946 --> 01:02:55.054
Thanks, Mom.

01:02:55.115 --> 01:02:56.628
Oh, my God, I fell asleep.

01:02:59.736 --> 01:03:01.218
Well, that's a
good look for you.

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:04.246
Trashed.

01:03:05.885 --> 01:03:09.320
Oh, my God, I'm just locked in.
I can't...

01:03:09.381 --> 01:03:11.419
I can't turn it off right now.

01:03:14.553 --> 01:03:16.843
Do you think Bill and Mrs. G

01:03:17.474 --> 01:03:19.079
paid extra attention to me

01:03:19.139 --> 01:03:22.480
because Dad was like a
big developer back then?

01:03:23.505 --> 01:03:25.609
No, that didn't have
anything to do with it.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.944
It was because you were

01:03:29.703 --> 01:03:31.425
an unusual child,

01:03:32.085 --> 01:03:34.864
and you knew how
to talk to adults.

01:03:35.407 --> 01:03:37.728
I was thinking about the
first time that you met him.

01:03:38.509 --> 01:03:40.418
You know when he came
here to pick me up?

01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:42.420
Oh, I'll never forget that day.

01:03:43.165 --> 01:03:45.301
You kidding? All my
antenna went off.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.723
As soon as you were out
of the house with him,

01:03:47.784 --> 01:03:49.084
I ran to your father.

01:03:49.722 --> 01:03:50.831
-Flowers.
-Yeah.

01:03:51.639 --> 01:03:53.665
He gave me flowers. And look,

01:03:53.855 --> 01:03:55.318
he gave you a gift, too.

01:03:55.378 --> 01:03:56.120
Here.

01:03:57.446 --> 01:03:58.748
Why would anyone do that?

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:00.979
Just like your mother.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.559
You think the world
is full of danger.

01:04:02.633 --> 01:04:05.503
Our daughter spends
every weekend in the home

01:04:05.564 --> 01:04:07.907
of a divorced woman on
her second marriage.

01:04:07.968 --> 01:04:09.391
Nadine, what are you
even talking about?

01:04:09.452 --> 01:04:10.811
What do we really
know about her?

01:04:11.659 --> 01:04:13.147
And now this Bill?

01:04:13.386 --> 01:04:14.378
Mom, sorry.

01:04:14.472 --> 01:04:17.439
I just... Can we go... Ow!
Can we go inside the house?

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.546
-Oh, yeah, sure.
-Yeah, sorry. I just...

01:04:19.607 --> 01:04:21.974
-Here, I'll take your bag.
-Okay, thanks.

01:04:22.622 --> 01:04:25.712
Didn't Bill bring Dad,
like, a paperweight?

01:04:25.773 --> 01:04:26.745
Yeah.

01:04:27.706 --> 01:04:28.305
He did.

01:04:28.918 --> 01:04:30.787
Was it like Christmas
or something?

01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:34.171
No, it wasn't Christmas.
It was autumn.

01:04:35.677 --> 01:04:37.425
You and Dad were going somewhere

01:04:37.486 --> 01:04:39.055
'cause Grandma was
here babysitting.

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:41.253
Was she? I don't remember.

01:04:41.532 --> 01:04:43.540
He wasn't taking me to Mrs. G's.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.361
I just wanted to say

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.720
that I'm glad you
guys are all here.

01:04:48.781 --> 01:04:49.801
I wanted to share
my good fortune

01:04:49.862 --> 01:04:50.987
with the people that I love.

01:04:51.048 --> 01:04:52.636
My boys, and Jenny.

01:04:53.245 --> 01:04:53.967
So, cheers.

01:05:43.328 --> 01:05:46.055
-What was that man doing to you?
-Nothing!

01:05:46.116 --> 01:05:48.156
What do you mean, nothing?

01:05:51.475 --> 01:05:54.058
You wait until I
tell your parents!

01:05:57.283 --> 01:05:58.773
Grandma knew, right?

01:05:59.293 --> 01:06:01.940
So you knew something.

01:06:02.079 --> 01:06:04.142
What are you talking about? No.

01:06:04.203 --> 01:06:07.892
Well, I mean she saw Bill
and I, out front, kiss,

01:06:07.953 --> 01:06:09.819
and she said she
was gonna tell you.

01:06:10.043 --> 01:06:11.635
My mother saw you?

01:06:11.696 --> 01:06:13.732
She didn't tell you something
about seeing us kiss?

01:06:13.793 --> 01:06:17.277
-She said she was gonna tell.
-No, absolutely not.

01:06:17.753 --> 01:06:18.742
I would've killed him.

01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:23.340
Of course, whenever I asked
you about Bill, you did lie.

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:26.232
Yeah, and you lied to yourself.

01:06:26.293 --> 01:06:27.660
Whoa, wait a minute.

01:06:27.721 --> 01:06:29.674
I asked you specifically

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:32.275
if Bill and Mrs. G
were having an affair,

01:06:32.335 --> 01:06:35.998
and you looked me right in
the eye and you said no.

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:37.909
Why are you so angry now?

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:40.830
Well, why are you not angry?
That's what I want to know.

01:06:41.788 --> 01:06:43.179
How would you...

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:44.787
How would you feel if
it was your daughter?

01:06:44.848 --> 01:06:45.758
What would you do?

01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:46.973
Huh?

01:06:47.126 --> 01:06:49.326
Mom, you knew something.

01:06:49.387 --> 01:06:51.859
You told Dad, and he
talked you out of it.

01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:53.945
That's true.

01:06:54.366 --> 01:06:55.735
You were following Dad's rules,

01:06:55.796 --> 01:06:57.973
just like Mrs. G
followed Bill's rules.

01:06:58.057 --> 01:07:01.391
Are you equating me with Mrs. G
and you father with that...?

01:07:01.452 --> 01:07:03.921
No, no. Mom, listen.

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:05.572
I'm saying it's complicated.

01:07:05.632 --> 01:07:07.283
I'm saying she was
deeply insecure,

01:07:07.344 --> 01:07:10.516
she was probably sexually
abused herself as a kid.

01:07:10.816 --> 01:07:11.778
Probably.

01:07:13.145 --> 01:07:14.147
Trust me.

01:07:15.517 --> 01:07:17.677
I know. It can damage
your boundaries.

01:07:17.738 --> 01:07:20.776
At last, you admit
you were damaged.

01:07:22.812 --> 01:07:23.904
Fine, Mom.

01:07:26.435 --> 01:07:29.296
There's a question I've
been wanting to ask

01:07:29.357 --> 01:07:31.038
since I read your story.

01:07:31.597 --> 01:07:32.423
Yeah?

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:35.852
Did you like it?

01:07:37.739 --> 01:07:38.504
Mom...

01:07:42.484 --> 01:07:43.762
I was a kid.

01:07:44.282 --> 01:07:46.025
Why are you asking me that?

01:07:46.086 --> 01:07:48.077
I just don't understand.

01:07:48.271 --> 01:07:50.114
Why did you keep going back?

01:07:50.289 --> 01:07:51.694
I got something else.

01:07:53.752 --> 01:07:55.298
What? Tell me. I want to know.

01:07:56.255 --> 01:07:57.375
Love. I...

01:07:59.979 --> 01:08:02.397
I wanted somebody to
think I was special.

01:08:04.672 --> 01:08:05.429
Well...

01:08:07.539 --> 01:08:09.298
you were always special to me.

01:08:09.359 --> 01:08:11.088
Mom, Jesus.

01:08:12.587 --> 01:08:15.248
And then after that, you
became so promiscuous.

01:08:15.744 --> 01:08:17.426
You slept with all kinds of men.

01:08:17.487 --> 01:08:18.430
Foreign men,

01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:20.328
married men...

01:08:20.808 --> 01:08:22.158
You didn't care about the wives.

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.885
-Mom...
-You didn't care about anything.

01:08:24.374 --> 01:08:26.274
You sound very old-fashioned.

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:27.661
That's old-fashioned, huh?

01:08:27.721 --> 01:08:29.965
You were with one
man your entire life.

01:08:31.303 --> 01:08:33.866
I didn't... I didn't want
to be stuck like that.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:35.805
I didn't want to be like you.

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:43.327
Excuse me.

01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:36.255
Bill Allens has stood on
the podium in 1960 and 1964.

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:39.245
When he moved to teaching
at the university,

01:09:39.538 --> 01:09:41.738
his vision extended
far beyond the valley.

01:09:41.798 --> 01:09:43.746
-And lunges.
-Bill became a coaching legend.

01:09:43.807 --> 01:09:44.568
And now butt kicks.

01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:47.290
He would cultivate his
larger-than-life image

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.665
at universities all
across the country.

01:09:49.725 --> 01:09:52.163
Coach Allens picked me out of
a crowd and believed in me.

01:09:52.344 --> 01:09:54.701
They called his relay team
the island of the misfit toys.

01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:58.234
We were all kids who no
one would have noticed,

01:09:58.385 --> 01:10:01.714
but he saw our talent and
he just pushed us to excel.

01:10:01.826 --> 01:10:03.275
And we all want to win,

01:10:03.462 --> 01:10:04.744
but that's secondary.

01:10:05.003 --> 01:10:06.983
What's most important
is that we feel

01:10:07.044 --> 01:10:08.749
that we've done this as a team.

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:13.375
And we've learned to persevere
and strive for excellence.

01:10:13.466 --> 01:10:15.782
And I hope that you think
of this time fondly,

01:10:16.273 --> 01:10:19.044
and that it helped
make you who you are.

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:20.587
William P. Allens.

01:10:20.648 --> 01:10:23.690
Yeah, he coached at the
university from '71 to '82.

01:10:24.325 --> 01:10:28.137
You said that he sexually
abused you in '73.

01:10:28.197 --> 01:10:32.017
But, um... we were...
We had a relationship.

01:10:33.769 --> 01:10:35.850
Okay, um, I'm very sorry.

01:10:36.476 --> 01:10:38.364
I'm... I'm very sorry.

01:10:38.761 --> 01:10:39.797
I hope this helps.

01:10:39.858 --> 01:10:41.971
I was able to get
his phone number

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:44.082
from one of my investigators.

01:10:44.143 --> 01:10:44.742
Oh.

01:10:45.601 --> 01:10:46.348
Thank you.

01:10:54.836 --> 01:10:57.537
I assume you're in the process
of building a case against him.

01:10:58.757 --> 01:11:00.654
No, I just, um,

01:11:00.887 --> 01:11:03.370
I just wanted to know
what's happened to him,

01:11:03.431 --> 01:11:05.323
you know, since me and...

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.692
why he left the
university after '82.

01:11:11.589 --> 01:11:13.588
Hello, you've reached
William Allens.

01:11:13.779 --> 01:11:14.924
Best in Sports.

01:11:15.735 --> 01:11:17.793
Leave a message and
I'll return your call...

01:11:21.422 --> 01:11:24.043
Well, you probably have
your answer for that.

01:11:24.104 --> 01:11:25.354
I mean if he abused...

01:11:26.153 --> 01:11:27.857
If you had a relationship,

01:11:28.825 --> 01:11:30.744
that usually means
that there were others.

01:11:31.225 --> 01:11:33.481
-Others?
-There's never only one.

01:11:33.862 --> 01:11:36.203
Detective Amato said
something about others.

01:11:36.264 --> 01:11:37.482
Can he find them?

01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:38.640
I don't...

01:11:39.403 --> 01:11:41.360
Mom, there weren't others.
I would have known.

01:11:41.421 --> 01:11:42.829
Oh, for God's sakes.

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:45.370
Honestly, sometimes I
find it hard to believe

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:46.846
you're my own child.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:02.085
Hello, you've reached
William Allens.

01:12:02.393 --> 01:12:03.698
Best in Sports.

01:12:04.317 --> 01:12:06.065
Leave a message and
I'll return your call

01:12:06.126 --> 01:12:07.718
at my earliest convenience.

01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:10.576
Hey, Bill, uh, this is J...

01:12:11.146 --> 01:12:12.701
This is Jenny Fox.

01:12:24.967 --> 01:12:27.828
Many, many young athletes.

01:12:30.982 --> 01:12:32.589
How many others were there?

01:12:36.437 --> 01:12:37.799
Was I the youngest?

01:12:39.885 --> 01:12:42.123
Someone else must
have known about me.

01:12:43.841 --> 01:12:45.511
There must have been a witness.

01:12:55.358 --> 01:12:56.388
Who are you?

01:13:00.195 --> 01:13:01.882
The secret to the
perfect apple pie...

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.984
Don't tell anyone, though.
It's our secret.

01:13:05.045 --> 01:13:06.882
Jews were not allowed
to ride horses,

01:13:06.943 --> 01:13:08.714
because no Jew could be
higher than a Russian.

01:13:08.866 --> 01:13:09.701
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:13:09.994 --> 01:13:13.212
I don't think we should
tell Mrs. G about us.

01:13:13.628 --> 01:13:14.838
Use that crop, Jenny.

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:16.908
I don't think she's quite ready.

01:13:17.592 --> 01:13:19.196
There's always blood
the first time.

01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:28.796
You remember me,
don't you, silly?

01:13:33.758 --> 01:13:35.881
Sure. That's Iris.

01:13:36.302 --> 01:13:39.398
She was the college student
that ran Mrs. G's barn.

01:13:40.237 --> 01:13:41.646
She was so sweet.

01:13:42.675 --> 01:13:44.869
I don't remember. Was
she around all the time?

01:13:45.026 --> 01:13:47.089
She was there the day that Mrs. G

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:49.426
put you on her stallion, Puff.

01:13:50.969 --> 01:13:52.009
Such a cute kid.

01:13:52.496 --> 01:13:53.796
A lot of heart, that one.

01:13:54.243 --> 01:13:56.267
She's made huge
improvements this summer...

01:13:56.625 --> 01:13:57.499
leaps and bounds.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.639
Funny, now that we're
talking about it,

01:13:59.753 --> 01:14:01.578
there's something
else I remember.

01:14:01.656 --> 01:14:02.851
Isn't he gorgeous?

01:14:03.444 --> 01:14:04.313
She is.

01:14:09.005 --> 01:14:10.296
Have you lost weight, Becky?

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.595
-I've noticed it too.
-Mm.

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:15.150
You're lookin' really good.

01:14:15.211 --> 01:14:17.388
I'm sure Bill didn't
mean anything by it,

01:14:17.449 --> 01:14:19.496
-but I was so repressed...
-Keep up your training,

01:14:19.599 --> 01:14:21.321
you'll be able to compete
with us in the fall.

01:14:22.649 --> 01:14:24.548
Love for you to join my
inner-city running team.

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:26.564
I couldn't handle him

01:14:26.802 --> 01:14:29.753
noticing me, you
know, as a woman.

01:14:32.917 --> 01:14:34.873
Do you know how to get
in touch with Iris?

01:14:35.032 --> 01:14:36.447
Oh, not a clue.

01:14:37.321 --> 01:14:39.339
I don't think I even
knew her last name.

01:14:39.848 --> 01:14:41.177
But Mrs. G would know.

01:14:41.238 --> 01:14:42.898
She was so close with her.

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:53.008
You've reached the
Gramercy residence.

01:14:53.199 --> 01:14:55.322
Please leave a
message for Dr. G or I

01:14:55.383 --> 01:14:56.526
after the beep tone.

01:14:57.530 --> 01:15:00.093
Hel... Hello, Jane,
it's Jennifer Fox.

01:15:01.203 --> 01:15:02.276
Sorry I missed you.

01:15:02.337 --> 01:15:05.245
I'm just... it's funny,
I'm near your house.

01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:07.494
I just thought it would
be lovely to come by

01:15:07.555 --> 01:15:09.255
and say hello again.

01:15:13.712 --> 01:15:14.796
Shit.

01:15:24.002 --> 01:15:27.166
I'm ready to make a
group beyond marriage.

01:15:29.779 --> 01:15:31.170
Marriage is terrible.

01:15:34.865 --> 01:15:37.696
Beyond all formal
rules of commitment.

01:15:42.476 --> 01:15:43.686
Jenny, do you trust me?

01:15:44.732 --> 01:15:45.344
Yeah.

01:15:45.864 --> 01:15:46.927
Do you want to come with me?

01:15:48.304 --> 01:15:50.030
I want us to make a real group.

01:15:52.259 --> 01:15:55.840
You, me, Mrs. G, and Iris.

01:15:59.483 --> 01:16:00.611
Iris.

01:16:36.943 --> 01:16:38.697
visiting my mom and...

01:16:38.758 --> 01:16:40.826
-Of course not.
-I'm so sorry.

01:16:40.887 --> 01:16:42.983
Oh, I brought you
a bottle of wine.

01:16:43.044 --> 01:16:43.789
Oh!

01:16:44.326 --> 01:16:45.938
But when I was at my mom's,

01:16:45.999 --> 01:16:49.553
I found some treasures
of you competing.

01:16:49.881 --> 01:16:52.160
Oh. I wanted to compete
again this summer,

01:16:52.244 --> 01:16:54.768
but with Anthony sick,
I can't plan anything.

01:16:55.131 --> 01:16:56.167
I wake up every morning

01:16:56.228 --> 01:16:58.189
and don't know if I'll be
able to leave the house.

01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:00.308
I understand. That
must be so hard.

01:17:00.369 --> 01:17:02.175
Oh, thank you.

01:17:02.436 --> 01:17:05.111
So, I found some pictures
you might find...

01:17:05.172 --> 01:17:05.858
amusing...

01:17:06.595 --> 01:17:11.729
from the summer that I
stayed here with you.

01:17:11.973 --> 01:17:12.700
Mm.

01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:14.919
Let's see.

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.985
Do you recognize that lady?

01:17:18.046 --> 01:17:21.353
Oh, my! That is a
good picture of me.

01:17:21.701 --> 01:17:23.672
I don't have any good
photos of me at all.

01:17:24.186 --> 01:17:25.719
Remember these girls?

01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:28.255
Who is this?

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.427
Me.

01:17:39.581 --> 01:17:41.930
I was trying to remember, uh...

01:17:43.395 --> 01:17:45.342
who was the older girl?

01:17:45.826 --> 01:17:48.373
Very pretty brunette who
was there that summer?

01:17:48.447 --> 01:17:49.708
Iris Rose.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.397
-Yeah.
-Can you imagine?

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:53.012
Two flowers for a name.

01:17:53.663 --> 01:17:54.838
God, she was beautiful.

01:17:54.983 --> 01:17:56.549
-Yeah.
-She was in college.

01:17:56.610 --> 01:17:57.901
She worked for me all that year.

01:17:57.962 --> 01:17:59.536
Yeah, I remember that.

01:17:59.969 --> 01:18:02.221
Do you know how to
get a hold of Iris?

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:03.621
What's this?

01:18:06.873 --> 01:18:08.978
Oh, I didn't mean to... uh...

01:18:10.431 --> 01:18:11.371
it's Bill.

01:18:11.668 --> 01:18:14.043
I-I-I was looking
on the Internet,

01:18:14.104 --> 01:18:16.349
and there was a... A
book on American running,

01:18:16.410 --> 01:18:19.136
and they... they
had a whole, um...

01:18:19.799 --> 01:18:21.670
Yeah, what... what
happened to Bill?

01:18:21.731 --> 01:18:22.797
I don't know.

01:18:24.293 --> 01:18:25.078
Uh...

01:18:26.295 --> 01:18:27.667
Let me get my glasses.

01:18:28.932 --> 01:18:31.790
There were two chapters
dedicated to him

01:18:31.858 --> 01:18:34.204
and all about his coaching.
I guess they've...

01:18:35.226 --> 01:18:38.920
they've named a wing
after him at a university.

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:39.914
Last I heard,

01:18:40.322 --> 01:18:42.875
his sister called me,
trying to find Bill,

01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:45.244
because their...

01:18:47.273 --> 01:18:48.241
their mother...

01:18:54.459 --> 01:18:55.886
Let's get you that map.

01:18:56.168 --> 01:18:57.984
I'll give you directions
to get out of here so...

01:18:58.045 --> 01:19:00.181
Franny told me that you had
trained for the World Games,

01:19:00.242 --> 01:19:01.970
so I was sure he trained you.

01:19:02.031 --> 01:19:02.835
No, he didn't.

01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:05.128
She was wrong.
I wasn't in the World Games,

01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:07.271
although I have won
several gold medals.

01:19:11.534 --> 01:19:13.574
I loved you and Bill so much.

01:19:13.635 --> 01:19:16.262
Here's the turn-off
for the interstate.

01:19:17.496 --> 01:19:19.195
I just need to
know what happened.

01:19:20.897 --> 01:19:22.352
You just follow
this road out here.

01:19:22.413 --> 01:19:24.032
-It isn't hard.
-You must've known.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.114
It's a little dark
out right now.

01:19:25.175 --> 01:19:26.448
And then you'll find the turn-off

01:19:26.509 --> 01:19:28.039
and you'll be on the
interstate in no time.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.817
I need to talk about it
with someone who was there.

01:19:31.485 --> 01:19:32.379
Please.

01:19:33.574 --> 01:19:35.137
You can take the
map if you'd like.

01:19:36.112 --> 01:19:37.078
You should go now.

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:38.788
It's very late. I'm quite tired.

01:19:38.945 --> 01:19:40.681
Jane, is somebody here?

01:19:40.843 --> 01:19:42.855
-Ah, hello.
-Oh.

01:19:42.916 --> 01:19:45.446
-It's... It's Jenny Fox.
-Jenny! Jenny Fox!

01:19:45.507 --> 01:19:46.797
-Yes.
-Ho ho ho!

01:19:46.977 --> 01:19:48.485
Oh, good to see you.

01:19:48.546 --> 01:19:50.822
-Hello, Dr. G.
-Jenny Fox.

01:19:51.385 --> 01:19:52.938
Jenny just said that
she was leaving.

01:19:53.951 --> 01:19:54.663
Oh.

01:19:54.724 --> 01:19:56.543
Sorry, it's so late. I know.

01:20:14.167 --> 01:20:16.407
Oh, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny,

01:20:16.467 --> 01:20:18.140
with all your questions.

01:20:24.126 --> 01:20:27.414
I feel like you want me to
apologize for something.

01:20:27.475 --> 01:20:28.152
I'm not sure.

01:20:28.678 --> 01:20:29.408
What do you want?

01:20:30.962 --> 01:20:32.384
-No.
-No?

01:20:33.177 --> 01:20:33.835
Okay.

01:20:35.162 --> 01:20:36.918
I just want to know you.

01:20:39.091 --> 01:20:39.939
You can't.

01:20:47.226 --> 01:20:48.920
I'm trying to understand.

01:20:50.115 --> 01:20:52.686
Do you know how lucky you were
to have a teacher like Bill?

01:20:54.288 --> 01:20:55.531
He's so special.

01:20:59.828 --> 01:21:01.555
I never had anyone like him.

01:21:16.570 --> 01:21:18.842
You never win
without perseverance.

01:21:30.549 --> 01:21:32.139
Just a little while longer,

01:21:32.485 --> 01:21:34.071
and then it will be over,

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:36.293
and it will never hurt again.

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:37.918
You'll see.

01:22:25.145 --> 01:22:27.060
Now you are a woman, my love.

01:23:07.378 --> 01:23:09.069
Professor Fox, are you okay?

01:23:11.048 --> 01:23:12.299
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:23:14.992 --> 01:23:17.849
Okay, so ordinarily I'd say

01:23:18.444 --> 01:23:21.044
you should take the
time to build up trust

01:23:21.689 --> 01:23:23.021
with your subject, right?

01:23:26.475 --> 01:23:27.615
But, um...

01:23:28.996 --> 01:23:31.356
sometimes you
gotta surprise 'em.

01:23:33.792 --> 01:23:36.034
Right? To get beyond
their defences.

01:23:36.647 --> 01:23:39.356
So, Samantha, why don't you...

01:23:40.203 --> 01:23:42.873
tell us all about your
first sexual experience.

01:23:45.832 --> 01:23:48.456
Uh, yeah, okay.

01:23:48.914 --> 01:23:50.075
I was...

01:23:50.204 --> 01:23:51.338
I was 17.

01:23:52.085 --> 01:23:53.198
His name was Rick.

01:23:54.127 --> 01:23:55.128
Yeah, he was my age.

01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:59.175
So, your childhood
sweetheart or whatever?

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:01.335
Yeah.

01:24:02.492 --> 01:24:04.615
And did you enjoy it?

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:06.813
Did I enjoy it?

01:24:07.336 --> 01:24:09.986
Um, yeah, I think.

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:13.000
Right, the whole thing
was actually just...

01:24:13.646 --> 01:24:14.559
It was kind of sweet,

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:15.997
because we'd been
best friends since...

01:24:16.744 --> 01:24:18.559
God, sixth grade?

01:24:18.978 --> 01:24:21.585
You know, we had no
idea what we were doing.

01:24:21.659 --> 01:24:22.953
We were just a couple of kids.

01:24:23.589 --> 01:24:24.933
Looking back on it, I...

01:24:25.922 --> 01:24:28.969
I was younger than I thought
of myself to be, you know?

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.906
And yet, I'll never
forget in the moment,

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:36.070
there was just so
much tenderness.

01:24:36.846 --> 01:24:39.165
I think I even had a little...

01:24:39.635 --> 01:24:40.718
um...

01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:43.243
you know.

01:24:43.304 --> 01:24:45.036
You know what I'm saying.

01:24:45.187 --> 01:24:45.956
No. What?

01:24:46.017 --> 01:24:46.797
Uh...

01:24:48.098 --> 01:24:49.874
I mean, if you're not going
to be able to talk about sex,

01:24:49.935 --> 01:24:52.004
I don't know how you're going to
interview other people about...

01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:53.947
all kinds of shit, so...

01:24:54.346 --> 01:24:55.881
Okay. Uh...

01:24:57.052 --> 01:25:00.256
I think I had a little...
orgasm.

01:25:00.516 --> 01:25:01.919
I don't know,
I wasn't expecting it.

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.430
I didn't know what it was.

01:25:03.578 --> 01:25:06.284
It just... It wasn't
the same as it is now.

01:25:07.414 --> 01:25:09.270
You know, because in the
beginning it's like...

01:25:10.113 --> 01:25:13.225
it's just like these little...
sparks.

01:25:15.939 --> 01:25:17.118
And, I mean, it felt really...

01:25:17.671 --> 01:25:19.246
just really natural, I think.

01:25:19.627 --> 01:25:21.780
So it's a tough thing,
because what happens is,

01:25:21.841 --> 01:25:24.514
especially at that age,
is that it feels good.

01:25:24.715 --> 01:25:26.332
I mean, it feels good.

01:25:26.693 --> 01:25:28.985
Someone is touching you
in an area that is sexual,

01:25:29.046 --> 01:25:31.317
and so you kind of
enjoy it, and so...

01:25:31.566 --> 01:25:33.373
-There's guilt.
-There's a sense of like...

01:25:33.434 --> 01:25:34.416
well there's a sense of guilt,

01:25:34.477 --> 01:25:36.017
of feeling like
you enjoyed this,

01:25:36.312 --> 01:25:37.769
and not understanding
that it was...

01:25:38.039 --> 01:25:40.612
It's not a good thing
and it's not appropriate.

01:25:42.092 --> 01:25:44.140
One needn't be ashamed. I mean,

01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:45.607
you know...

01:25:46.869 --> 01:25:49.892
I mean, otherwise we wouldn't
be able to live with ourselves.

01:25:53.682 --> 01:25:56.745
I have friends who just,
like, go on about sex

01:25:56.806 --> 01:25:58.609
like it's the most amazing
thing in the world,

01:25:58.670 --> 01:26:00.278
and I just... I can't relate.

01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:01.991
Like, what? Why?

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:03.699
You know?

01:26:04.522 --> 01:26:06.033
What's so fantastic about it?

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:07.797
Because I also never orgasmed.

01:26:08.845 --> 01:26:09.746
You know?

01:26:09.885 --> 01:26:11.511
Can you when you're alone?

01:26:12.987 --> 01:26:13.905
Yeah. But never with someone.

01:26:14.618 --> 01:26:15.334
Right.

01:26:15.574 --> 01:26:16.496
Yeah, but I...

01:26:17.193 --> 01:26:19.151
I feel like that's
normal for most women.

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:21.852
I wasn't abused,

01:26:22.535 --> 01:26:24.821
but for me it took me
years to get comfortable,

01:26:24.882 --> 01:26:27.282
to have an orgasm with a man.

01:26:27.825 --> 01:26:29.998
I don't think that it has
anything to do with abuse.

01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:44.558
Hello, you've reached
William Allens.

01:26:44.642 --> 01:26:45.861
Best in Sports.

01:26:46.113 --> 01:26:47.844
Leave a message, and
I'll return your call

01:26:47.905 --> 01:26:49.445
at my earliest convenience.

01:26:50.429 --> 01:26:53.133
Hey, Bill. This is
Jenny Fox calling again.

01:26:53.194 --> 01:26:55.812
I'm just... I don't want to
keep calling and calling,

01:26:56.679 --> 01:26:58.532
but I think we need to talk.

01:26:59.521 --> 01:27:01.407
So can you please call me back?

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:16.383
Hello?

01:27:16.444 --> 01:27:18.715
Hey, Jennifer. It's
Detective Amato.

01:27:18.893 --> 01:27:19.987
Oh. Hey.

01:27:20.637 --> 01:27:22.484
Listen, I thought you might
be interested to know,

01:27:22.552 --> 01:27:23.633
there'll be a big event.

01:27:24.257 --> 01:27:26.210
William Allens is
receiving an award.

01:27:26.923 --> 01:27:27.363
Oh...

01:27:27.424 --> 01:27:29.741
Also, I found that woman
you were looking for.

01:27:30.352 --> 01:27:31.886
Iris Rose?

01:27:32.133 --> 01:27:33.456
She teaches middle school.

01:27:33.864 --> 01:27:35.270
Okay, okay.

01:27:46.541 --> 01:27:49.925
See how miserable people look
in their little nuclear units?

01:27:50.383 --> 01:27:51.895
-Stop fighting.
-Come on.

01:27:53.847 --> 01:27:55.209
It's all those rules.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.017
Monogamy. Marriage.

01:27:57.281 --> 01:27:58.402
It's killing people.

01:27:58.824 --> 01:28:00.599
Maybe it just depends
on the people.

01:28:00.695 --> 01:28:01.702
Two tickets, please.

01:28:01.925 --> 01:28:04.257
You really need to start
thinking more clearly, Jenny.

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:05.947
Thank you.

01:28:10.232 --> 01:28:10.846
Jenny?

01:28:11.744 --> 01:28:12.306
Jenny?

01:28:13.174 --> 01:28:15.180
Oh! Hey, Iris!

01:28:15.264 --> 01:28:17.108
-How are you?
-Good! Good to see you!

01:28:17.168 --> 01:28:18.785
-You too.
-I'm so glad you called.

01:28:18.845 --> 01:28:20.676
Do you want to, um,
grab a tea or something?

01:28:20.759 --> 01:28:22.274
Yeah, there's a little
place right down here

01:28:22.335 --> 01:28:23.429
-that we can go.
-Okay, okay.

01:28:23.895 --> 01:28:27.319
And you and Bill were, um...
were lovers, right?

01:28:28.233 --> 01:28:29.482
Yes, um...

01:28:30.083 --> 01:28:33.080
Mrs. G arranged that I
would work for him part-time

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.019
and work for her the other time.

01:28:35.313 --> 01:28:38.412
And I would work in his garden.

01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:41.049
And I remember I was
wearing a bikini,

01:28:42.001 --> 01:28:43.307
and he invited me in.

01:28:46.348 --> 01:28:48.011
Oh, it was the '70s.

01:28:48.072 --> 01:28:49.557
Yeah, I remember him...

01:28:50.772 --> 01:28:51.774
He said that...

01:28:51.835 --> 01:28:54.410
I think you guys had a
threesome with Mrs. G, right?

01:28:56.061 --> 01:28:58.112
-He told you that?
-Yeah.

01:28:58.348 --> 01:28:59.400
Yeah, we did.

01:29:01.732 --> 01:29:03.460
Yeah, we were lovers too.

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:05.620
You and Bill?

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:07.123
Mm-hmm.

01:29:08.015 --> 01:29:09.209
But how old were you?

01:29:10.871 --> 01:29:11.961
Thirteen.

01:29:14.291 --> 01:29:15.049
So...

01:29:15.321 --> 01:29:16.276
Wow. That...

01:29:18.913 --> 01:29:20.960
That's the age of the
kids that I teach now.

01:29:21.863 --> 01:29:23.928
Yeah, kids, right.

01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:28.256
Do you have any memory of, um...

01:29:31.038 --> 01:29:33.514
Mrs. G and Bill
planning a foursome?

01:29:34.162 --> 01:29:34.992
Do you remember that?

01:29:35.166 --> 01:29:35.990
With you?

01:29:36.051 --> 01:29:38.550
Yeah. I think they were
planning a weekend,

01:29:38.809 --> 01:29:41.023
like around here somewhere,
to go to a hotel...

01:29:42.164 --> 01:29:43.721
I don't remember that at all.

01:29:45.471 --> 01:29:46.301
The four of us?

01:29:46.429 --> 01:29:48.495
Yeah, Bill and Mrs. G and you...

01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:51.710
bringing me into it.

01:29:54.872 --> 01:29:56.117
Oh, damn it.

01:29:57.863 --> 01:29:58.717
Wow.

01:30:00.244 --> 01:30:02.949
Boy, I haven't thought about
that in a long... long time.

01:30:05.425 --> 01:30:06.341
Yeah.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.358
How'd he rope her into that?

01:30:18.247 --> 01:30:19.359
Rope Mrs. G?

01:30:20.508 --> 01:30:22.183
No, it was...

01:30:22.934 --> 01:30:26.139
more like she was the cat
bringing the mouse to him.

01:30:28.805 --> 01:30:29.570
Wow.

01:30:31.242 --> 01:30:34.124
Yeah. How... How...
So she was the one...

01:30:34.185 --> 01:30:35.894
Oh, yeah, she was
totally into it.

01:30:41.918 --> 01:30:44.129
I've met two very special people

01:30:45.103 --> 01:30:46.876
whom I've come to love dearly.

01:30:47.605 --> 01:30:49.817
Jenny, I've got a crazy idea.

01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:51.632
What if you kept your
horse with me all fall,

01:30:51.693 --> 01:30:53.335
and then you could
visit on the weekends?

01:30:53.396 --> 01:30:56.560
Mrs. G has a fantasy of
you sucking on her breast.

01:31:00.566 --> 01:31:01.960
My beauties.

01:31:09.775 --> 01:31:13.407
Jenny, what we really want to
do is explore our unconscious.

01:31:13.915 --> 01:31:15.641
Bring it into consciousness.

01:31:16.525 --> 01:31:17.135
Together.

01:31:18.453 --> 01:31:19.619
In our family.

01:31:19.949 --> 01:31:21.169
You'll have to tell your parents

01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:23.172
that you have a track
meet in Delaware.

01:31:24.095 --> 01:31:26.489
And then Mrs. G will pick
you up from school, and...

01:31:26.829 --> 01:31:28.895
Iris and I will meet you
at the hotel at 6:00.

01:31:28.956 --> 01:31:30.262
And then we'll
have you back home

01:31:31.071 --> 01:31:32.425
Sunday night, like usual.

01:31:32.716 --> 01:31:34.328
Bill and I have already
spoken to Iris about it,

01:31:34.389 --> 01:31:36.420
but we'd like you to
bring something special.

01:31:38.466 --> 01:31:40.319
And don't forget
your running shoes.

01:31:49.977 --> 01:31:51.801
Mom, did you get me
the juice I wanted?

01:31:51.861 --> 01:31:52.998
Sue, you're getting
it all over...

01:31:53.059 --> 01:31:54.265
Oh, here. Here's your juice.

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.288
Hey, Harold, Harold, no.

01:31:56.349 --> 01:31:57.499
It's my favourite kind.

01:32:02.469 --> 01:32:03.968
Darling, I'm sorry.

01:32:04.864 --> 01:32:06.646
Sit. Go. Sit.

01:32:07.885 --> 01:32:09.409
Go and sit!

01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:11.351
Nana, do you like my painting?

01:32:11.412 --> 01:32:13.785
I love it. Go and sit!

01:32:22.702 --> 01:32:23.533
Hey, Dad.

01:32:25.313 --> 01:32:25.971
Hey, babe.

01:33:01.205 --> 01:33:02.018
Hello?

01:33:02.282 --> 01:33:02.991
Jennifer.

01:33:04.135 --> 01:33:05.442
-Hey.
-I've been calling you.

01:33:05.503 --> 01:33:07.410
You haven't answered
any of my calls.

01:33:08.245 --> 01:33:09.988
I even tried you
at the university.

01:33:11.661 --> 01:33:12.398
Hello?

01:33:12.778 --> 01:33:14.443
Martin, I gotta go meet him.

01:33:14.538 --> 01:33:16.565
What are you... What
are you talking about?

01:33:17.130 --> 01:33:18.369
I need to see him.

01:33:18.443 --> 01:33:20.404
Look, I don't... Jennifer...

01:33:20.465 --> 01:33:22.031
I need to talk to him.
I need to try to...

01:33:22.092 --> 01:33:23.407
He's not gonna
tell you anything.

01:33:23.468 --> 01:33:24.425
figure out who he is.

01:33:24.486 --> 01:33:25.973
Listen, promise me, Jennifer.

01:33:26.034 --> 01:33:28.534
Promise me that you won't do
anything until I get there.

01:33:28.595 --> 01:33:30.853
-I just want to understand.
-I'm on the next plane back.

01:33:31.295 --> 01:33:32.237
-Jennifer, look...
-Babe, please.

01:33:32.374 --> 01:33:33.645
you cannot go there alone, okay?

01:33:33.706 --> 01:33:35.433
-Babe.
-Jennifer, listen to...

01:33:58.592 --> 01:34:00.882
Oh, honey, sweetie...

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:02.486
I feel sick.

01:34:03.535 --> 01:34:04.781
Yeah, you got a little fever.

01:34:05.344 --> 01:34:07.531
I think it's the flu
that's going around.

01:34:08.419 --> 01:34:09.279
Come on.

01:34:09.849 --> 01:34:10.857
We'll get you in bed.

01:34:12.259 --> 01:34:14.363
But I have a track
meet this weekend.

01:34:14.424 --> 01:34:15.881
Well, you'll have to cancel.

01:34:16.344 --> 01:34:17.568
Please, Mom?

01:34:17.709 --> 01:34:20.773
No. Nothing's that important.
I'll just call Mrs. G.

01:34:20.834 --> 01:34:22.064
We'll tell her you can't come.

01:34:22.579 --> 01:34:23.504
Okay?

01:34:23.699 --> 01:34:24.709
Let's get you in bed.

01:34:25.349 --> 01:34:26.071
All right?

01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:33.476
All right.

01:34:34.182 --> 01:34:36.001
I'll come check on
you in a few minutes.

01:35:01.925 --> 01:35:03.691
Just a few hours later,

01:35:05.294 --> 01:35:07.656
my stomach-ache was
completely gone.

01:35:11.506 --> 01:35:15.404
My body had told me what
my mind refused to accept.

01:35:18.271 --> 01:35:19.301
I'm tired.

01:35:20.058 --> 01:35:21.306
So tired.

01:35:22.984 --> 01:35:25.352
Tired in ways that I'm afraid.

01:35:26.822 --> 01:35:31.067
The fear is a fear
of a broken dream.

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:39.418
I have made a decision.

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.113
Go get your father.
It's time for dinner.

01:35:44.173 --> 01:35:45.809
-Okay, Mom.
-Harold?

01:35:45.869 --> 01:35:47.250
Wait, Harold...

01:35:54.438 --> 01:35:55.078
Hello?

01:35:55.928 --> 01:35:57.535
Hello? Bill?

01:35:58.279 --> 01:35:59.320
Jenny!

01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.534
I'm so happy you called.
I was worried sick.

01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:07.543
Jenny? Are you... Are you there?

01:36:09.112 --> 01:36:10.165
Yes, I'm here.

01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:13.791
Did you go on...

01:36:15.431 --> 01:36:17.787
with Jane and Iris without me?

01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:21.465
No, no. None of us wanted to.

01:36:23.645 --> 01:36:26.012
We all agreed, we want
to wait for you. So,

01:36:27.139 --> 01:36:29.202
don't worry. We will
pick another weekend.

01:36:33.351 --> 01:36:34.894
I don't want to see you anymore.

01:36:38.221 --> 01:36:38.914
Wait. It...

01:36:40.086 --> 01:36:40.989
Is it your parents?

01:36:41.050 --> 01:36:42.668
Because if it is,
I can talk to them.

01:36:43.842 --> 01:36:46.559
They don't... They don't
understand you the way that...

01:36:47.237 --> 01:36:50.141
that I do. And if you
don't want to do a weekend,

01:36:50.202 --> 01:36:51.548
we don't have to.

01:36:51.717 --> 01:36:53.173
I don't want to see you anymore.

01:36:53.233 --> 01:36:54.230
But Jenny...

01:36:58.203 --> 01:36:58.829
Jenny...

01:37:00.096 --> 01:37:00.854
please.

01:37:03.157 --> 01:37:04.079
I love you.

01:37:05.705 --> 01:37:06.838
I need you.

01:37:06.961 --> 01:37:08.815
We can work everything out.

01:37:10.566 --> 01:37:13.035
Please just... please
don't leave me.

01:37:13.152 --> 01:37:14.559
I'm gonna hang up now.

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:15.931
Don't hang up, wait, wait...

01:37:17.936 --> 01:37:18.884
Jenny?

01:37:20.847 --> 01:37:21.981
Jenny, dinner!

01:37:30.217 --> 01:37:32.083
Gramercy residence.
Jane speaking.

01:37:33.691 --> 01:37:35.301
Hello. It's Jenny.

01:37:36.652 --> 01:37:39.016
I'm coming to pick up
my horse this weekend.

01:37:42.111 --> 01:37:42.714
Fine.

01:38:21.457 --> 01:38:22.711
Stupid girl.

01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:28.977
Stupid, stupid girl.

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.367
Where's your father?

01:38:41.839 --> 01:38:43.059
'We had a dream.

01:38:43.989 --> 01:38:45.351
'A beautiful dream.

01:38:47.406 --> 01:38:50.504
'We were going to fill the
emptiness in each of our souls

01:38:51.675 --> 01:38:53.382
with love from the other.'

01:38:54.584 --> 01:38:56.302
What happened with you and Bill?

01:38:57.265 --> 01:38:58.449
Why'd you leave him?

01:38:58.759 --> 01:38:59.794
Me leave him?

01:39:03.462 --> 01:39:04.180
You don't know?

01:39:08.798 --> 01:39:10.290
You were just the
beginning, Jenny.

01:39:12.351 --> 01:39:13.612
There were so many others.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.396
I tried to keep up, but I'm old.

01:39:18.957 --> 01:39:19.859
I'm old.

01:39:22.214 --> 01:39:23.674
'But as so many dreams,

01:39:24.424 --> 01:39:26.646
reality does not hold true.'

01:39:28.355 --> 01:39:29.699
I couldn't ask for help.

01:39:30.970 --> 01:39:33.003
I was waiting for
you to save me.

01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:37.049
Somehow in my mind, it
couldn't be anybody else.

01:39:37.839 --> 01:39:39.094
It had to be you.

01:39:40.467 --> 01:39:41.504
Why didn't you?

01:39:42.994 --> 01:39:44.288
No one saved me.

01:39:45.753 --> 01:39:47.942
'The pretty colours and ribbons

01:39:48.661 --> 01:39:50.890
'I had decorated Bi
and Mrs. G with

01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:54.802
'disintegrated, and
they were left naked.

01:39:56.146 --> 01:39:59.000
'The overwhelming
pain of weakness.'

01:40:00.010 --> 01:40:03.200
'The sickening fact of someone'

01:40:04.287 --> 01:40:06.279
'who once seemed so strong.'

01:40:09.191 --> 01:40:13.738
'Only to find that the strength
is only in their words.'

01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:16.085
Thank you, Jenny.

01:40:16.312 --> 01:40:18.333
That's quite a powerful story.

01:40:18.954 --> 01:40:20.773
Do you mind telling us
where you got it from?

01:40:21.532 --> 01:40:22.192
Oh...

01:40:22.872 --> 01:40:23.748
I made it up.

01:40:24.901 --> 01:40:25.828
That's what I thought.

01:40:26.143 --> 01:40:27.824
You see, class,
fiction allows us

01:40:27.885 --> 01:40:31.394
to live things far outside
our own experiences...

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.341
Oh.

01:40:38.812 --> 01:40:40.056
Mom, don't stop.

01:40:40.726 --> 01:40:42.747
Oh, that's one of my
favourite memories.

01:40:42.891 --> 01:40:45.143
In the summers, after
the ice cream truck,

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.558
all the kids gathered around.

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:48.933
Listened to you play.

01:40:48.994 --> 01:40:51.010
I don't have it in
my fingers anymore.

01:40:58.076 --> 01:40:59.123
I failed.

01:41:00.232 --> 01:41:02.083
I didn't want it to be true.

01:41:02.464 --> 01:41:04.803
I told myself it
couldn't be true.

01:41:06.806 --> 01:41:09.799
I failed at the one thing
a mother is supposed to do.

01:41:11.225 --> 01:41:12.673
Protect her child.

01:41:14.161 --> 01:41:15.565
I am so sorry.

01:41:16.813 --> 01:41:17.978
You lied to me.

01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:21.477
You told me it was a good
thing all these years.

01:41:21.538 --> 01:41:22.627
And it was.

01:41:23.643 --> 01:41:24.467
I got an A.

01:41:24.528 --> 01:41:26.556
An A? You think that matters?

01:41:26.939 --> 01:41:28.229
That doesn't make it good.

01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:31.139
You want me to be
some pathetic victim.

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:33.270
Well, you know what? I'm not.

01:41:34.468 --> 01:41:36.450
I've got something
no one else does.

01:41:37.422 --> 01:41:38.620
I'm the teacher now.

01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:41.870
Not just some invisible kid.

01:41:42.319 --> 01:41:43.714
You'll never get married.

01:41:44.363 --> 01:41:45.827
I don't want to get married.

01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:48.026
Have you not been
listening to me?

01:41:48.622 --> 01:41:50.170
You'll never have children.

01:41:50.996 --> 01:41:52.175
I hate children.

01:41:53.386 --> 01:41:55.500
I don't want to have children.
I'm sure of that.

01:41:56.745 --> 01:41:58.117
But I know one thing.

01:41:59.652 --> 01:42:00.612
He loved me.

01:42:02.694 --> 01:42:03.339
He cried.

01:42:05.019 --> 01:42:06.144
He cried, didn't you see?

01:42:08.035 --> 01:42:09.155
And for years...

01:42:10.775 --> 01:42:12.373
he's gonna send me cards.

01:42:12.434 --> 01:42:14.604
Dear Jenny, how was
your graduation?

01:42:14.845 --> 01:42:16.384
Dear Jenny, please give
my best to your folks.

01:42:16.468 --> 01:42:17.967
Dear Jenny, with all
the trouble in Israel...

01:42:18.028 --> 01:42:20.215
I read about you in
the newspaper today...

01:42:20.297 --> 01:42:21.207
I hope you return
to your running.

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:23.421
Dear Jenny, I am so proud
of your growing career.

01:42:23.778 --> 01:42:25.095
Dear Jenny, you were
always such a natural.

01:42:25.156 --> 01:42:25.875
You see?

01:42:27.943 --> 01:42:29.853
I'm not the victim
of this story.

01:42:31.365 --> 01:42:32.366
I'm the hero.

01:42:33.282 --> 01:42:34.911
He fell apart, not me.

01:42:35.401 --> 01:42:36.950
You couldn't even
think that their lives

01:42:37.011 --> 01:42:38.714
might continue without you.

01:42:40.094 --> 01:42:41.659
That there would be others.

01:42:43.269 --> 01:42:45.279
You froze them in
time, didn't you?

01:42:47.453 --> 01:42:49.159
But you know, he's still alive,

01:42:49.256 --> 01:42:51.004
and I'm gonna go see him now.

01:42:51.065 --> 01:42:51.869
No.

01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:06.005
For his lifetime dedication
to the youth of Alexandria,

01:43:06.439 --> 01:43:09.312
we would like to award
William P. Allens

01:43:09.835 --> 01:43:12.645
this plaque of civic excellence.

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.649
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.

01:43:22.072 --> 01:43:24.153
-I'm actually deeply touched.
-I'm here for you.

01:43:24.214 --> 01:43:26.306
And this could not have
been done, obviously,

01:43:26.367 --> 01:43:28.062
without you, without
your support,

01:43:28.123 --> 01:43:29.566
the youth of this region,

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.310
they've learned to persevere.

01:43:32.937 --> 01:43:34.244
They've learned to...

01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:36.539
strive to excellence

01:43:37.592 --> 01:43:38.512
as a measure...

01:43:39.262 --> 01:43:42.074
of your focus, your
concern, your support.

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:44.134
Thank you.

01:43:45.039 --> 01:43:46.143
Thank you.

01:44:22.073 --> 01:44:23.174
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:44:24.127 --> 01:44:25.214
I don't believe we've met.

01:44:25.545 --> 01:44:27.127
I'm Jennifer.

01:44:27.304 --> 01:44:28.036
Hmm.

01:44:28.583 --> 01:44:29.506
How do you know William?

01:44:30.665 --> 01:44:33.621
Uh, he was my running coach.

01:44:34.287 --> 01:44:35.447
Of course.

01:44:36.058 --> 01:44:38.234
My husband is just
completely flattered

01:44:38.295 --> 01:44:39.781
that so many of
his former students

01:44:39.842 --> 01:44:41.029
-have come out to honour him.
-Husband?

01:44:41.133 --> 01:44:42.175
Yeah. Would...

01:44:43.159 --> 01:44:44.025
would you like to meet him?

01:44:44.292 --> 01:44:47.622
Uh, say hello, yeah. It's
been a long time, so...

01:44:48.518 --> 01:44:49.234
Okay.

01:44:53.899 --> 01:44:54.953
How are you feeling?

01:44:55.133 --> 01:44:57.005
-Really well.
-Ah, good, that's good.

01:44:57.066 --> 01:44:59.040
You're the best. You're
the best one we have.

01:44:59.101 --> 01:45:00.865
-I'm not kidding.
-Hi, Bill.

01:45:03.106 --> 01:45:04.395
Hey. Boy,

01:45:05.275 --> 01:45:08.050
your hair.
Such curls. Looks beautiful.

01:45:08.695 --> 01:45:11.609
Has anybody ever seen
such beautiful hair, huh?

01:45:12.432 --> 01:45:13.179
Miss...?

01:45:14.036 --> 01:45:14.519
Do you...

01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:16.169
It's Jenny.

01:45:18.024 --> 01:45:19.525
-Jen...
-Jenny Fox.

01:45:22.047 --> 01:45:22.853
Um...

01:45:24.583 --> 01:45:25.524
Jenny.

01:45:26.416 --> 01:45:29.424
Well, I never expected to see
you here in a million years.

01:45:29.624 --> 01:45:31.975
Yeah, it's been difficult
getting a hold of you.

01:45:32.036 --> 01:45:32.763
Jenny.

01:45:34.505 --> 01:45:36.357
Well, I have the...

01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:38.927
pit bull Marge here.

01:45:38.988 --> 01:45:40.978
-Yeah, we met.
-You got one of those?

01:45:41.039 --> 01:45:42.787
No, no, I never got married.

01:45:43.247 --> 01:45:45.120
You told me that was
selling out, remember?

01:45:45.625 --> 01:45:47.379
You got me. You got
me with that one.

01:45:47.453 --> 01:45:48.700
Yes, I remember that.

01:45:49.518 --> 01:45:51.493
So how long has it
been exactly, what...

01:45:53.137 --> 01:45:54.663
Time just flies
away, doesn't it?

01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:56.528
Yeah, in a blink.

01:45:57.048 --> 01:45:57.748
Blink.

01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.033
And one wrong blink

01:46:00.094 --> 01:46:01.603
and you're headed
down the wrong path.

01:46:02.225 --> 01:46:04.605
Excuse me, but how do
you guys know each other?

01:46:05.202 --> 01:46:07.528
Bill was my coach. Remember?

01:46:08.599 --> 01:46:09.348
Sure.

01:46:09.553 --> 01:46:10.553
We had a good time...

01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:13.087
When I was 13, right?

01:46:13.267 --> 01:46:13.894
Yeah.

01:46:14.151 --> 01:46:15.350
Natural athlete.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:18.011
I used to love to watch you
tuck your shoulder into a...

01:46:18.274 --> 01:46:19.056
turn and...

01:46:19.117 --> 01:46:20.645
Pretty good in bed too, right?

01:46:22.827 --> 01:46:23.577
Pardon me?

01:46:23.809 --> 01:46:24.824
You know what I said.

01:46:26.241 --> 01:46:27.685
You know what
happened, and so do I.

01:46:27.746 --> 01:46:29.657
I don't know what you...
What do you mean?

01:46:29.735 --> 01:46:31.860
I wanted you to know I
hated every minute of it.

01:46:32.704 --> 01:46:34.593
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

01:46:34.654 --> 01:46:37.440
No? You don't remember me
puking every time we had sex?

01:46:37.638 --> 01:46:39.916
And you would tell me maybe
it was because I was pregnant.

01:46:39.977 --> 01:46:40.716
But that would be hard,

01:46:40.777 --> 01:46:42.444
because I hadn't even
got my period yet.

01:46:42.505 --> 01:46:43.754
Remember that? Huh?

01:46:44.298 --> 01:46:45.547
A 13-year-old kid?

01:46:45.630 --> 01:46:47.287
-None of this is true.
-What happened to you

01:46:47.348 --> 01:46:48.419
that you would do that to me?

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:50.171
-None of this is true.
-I thought we were lovers.

01:46:50.232 --> 01:46:51.985
You didn't call me
your girlfriend?

01:46:52.046 --> 01:46:53.801
That's not true.
That's not true.

01:46:53.872 --> 01:46:54.960
You couldn't fit
your dick in me?

01:46:55.029 --> 01:46:57.443
-You don't remember that?
-Ohh. Okay, Jenny,

01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:58.918
it was nice seeing you.

01:46:59.286 --> 01:47:00.215
Huh, Bill?

01:47:01.104 --> 01:47:02.036
Bill.

01:47:02.323 --> 01:47:03.154
What happened to you?

01:47:03.215 --> 01:47:04.128
Can someone please
go get security?

01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:06.123
What happened to you, that
you would do that to me?

01:47:06.184 --> 01:47:07.102
Nothing happened to me.

01:47:07.163 --> 01:47:08.394
What do you mean
'What happened to me?'

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:10.380
It wasn't me. It
wasn't me, it was you!

01:47:10.574 --> 01:47:12.084
You didn't believe.
You didn't trust.

01:47:12.145 --> 01:47:14.327
Oh, I did believe.
That was the problem.

01:47:14.388 --> 01:47:16.463
-I believed you.
-You deceived yourself.

01:47:16.524 --> 01:47:17.539
Sweet girl, Jenny.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.500
-'We are higher than heaven.'
-It was you.

01:47:19.863 --> 01:47:22.171
It was you. You never believed.
You never believed.

01:47:22.232 --> 01:47:23.333
-Come on.
-You never trusted me.

01:47:23.394 --> 01:47:25.726
I believed your story.
Huh, Bill?

01:47:26.041 --> 01:47:27.668
You were the grown-up!

01:47:34.766 --> 01:47:35.702
What?

01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:39.441
Nobody else was coached by Bill?

01:48:08.156 --> 01:48:10.149
I'd like to begin this story

01:48:11.035 --> 01:48:13.533
by telling you
something so beautiful.

01:48:15.742 --> 01:48:18.028
I've met two very special people

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:20.727
whom I've come to love dearly.

01:48:22.415 --> 01:48:25.205
Imagine a woman who's married

01:48:26.133 --> 01:48:28.313
and a man who's divorced.

01:48:30.141 --> 01:48:30.766
Get this.

01:48:31.959 --> 01:48:33.212
I'm part of them both.

01:48:35.386 --> 01:48:36.561
I'm lucky enough

01:48:37.694 --> 01:48:39.354
to be able to share
in their love.
