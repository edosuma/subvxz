WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:04.097
You have no idea what it's like
to share your life with someone

00:04.097 --> 00:06.514
who you have literally
nothing to say to.

00:06.805 --> 00:07.888
I want a divorce.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.222
Are you drunk?

00:10.055 --> 00:12.097
I made one wrong decision.

00:12.097 --> 00:13.680
Julian meant nothing.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.930
I need to know. How many times
did you have intercourse?

00:17.430 --> 00:19.389
Thirty... 32.

00:20.930 --> 00:21.763
What the fuck?!

00:22.264 --> 00:24.097
FRANCES DUFRESNE:
You had an emotional affair.

00:24.097 --> 00:26.721
Never physical.
I did not cross that line.

00:26.721 --> 00:29.097
Wow. Right?

00:29.264 --> 00:29.972
Wow.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.721
You need to destroy him
before he destroys you.

00:32.721 --> 00:34.472
FRANCES:
He's the father of my children.

00:34.472 --> 00:36.264
Tell your children
you're getting divorced.

00:36.264 --> 00:38.264
It's like the first day
of divorce school.

00:38.264 --> 00:40.013
-I wanna be a good student.
-Robert, Robert, let's go.

00:40.013 --> 00:41.721
Your mother and I
are getting a divorce.

00:41.721 --> 00:43.305
Do you have any questions?

00:43.305 --> 00:44.305
Nah, I'm good.

00:44.721 --> 00:46.514
CARLA MENOTTI:
It is the perfect spot

00:46.514 --> 00:48.514
for the Frances
Dufresne gallery.

00:48.514 --> 00:50.264
It's exciting and terrifying.

00:50.264 --> 00:51.596
ROBERT DUFRESNE:
Residential real estate

00:51.596 --> 00:54.680
is when opportunity meets risk,
meets ebb, meets flow.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.013
That's barely a sentence.

00:56.013 --> 00:59.430
This block is such a boneyard
for small businesses.

00:59.430 --> 01:00.805
Oh, but it's perfect
for a gallery.

01:00.805 --> 01:02.888
This opening is miraculous.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.222
-FRANCES: Hello.

01:04.222 --> 01:06.805
-Hello Frances, this is
Robert's new lawyer.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.305
DALLAS HOLT: Tony Silvercreek
is one of the most

01:09.305 --> 01:10.805
disgusting lawyers.

01:10.805 --> 01:11.555
What're you doing?

01:12.097 --> 01:13.596
You don't have to act ugly,
that's what I'm here for.

01:13.596 --> 01:15.846
I don't know who your wife's
lawyer is, but wow.

01:15.846 --> 01:17.638
Your assets are frozen.
Court order.

01:17.972 --> 01:20.222
Are you authorized to have
custody over your children?

01:20.222 --> 01:22.930
We haven't had any
custody disputes.

01:22.930 --> 01:23.721
Until now.

01:24.180 --> 01:27.846
FRANCES: You have made
a terrible, irreparable mistake.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.472
- Ticket, please.
- Oh.

01:48.472 --> 01:51.013
- Thanks. Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

01:59.972 --> 02:01.472
Ticket, please.

02:10.222 --> 02:11.138
Mm.

02:14.514 --> 02:16.305
Now, hold on there,
buddy.

02:16.305 --> 02:17.680
All right,
given that your client

02:17.680 --> 02:19.721
had a recent payout
from her company,

02:19.721 --> 02:22.430
it is not out of line
to reopen the discussion
of spousal support.

02:22.430 --> 02:26.097
Your client
called the cops on her!
He's lucky he's not in jail.

02:26.097 --> 02:29.222
My client deeply regrets
the events of last month.

02:30.596 --> 02:31.514
I do.

02:33.430 --> 02:36.097
- I know.
- Elaine: And as
the documents clearly show,

02:36.097 --> 02:38.389
my client has opened
a small gallery.

02:38.389 --> 02:41.180
She does not have the income,
nor, frankly, the obligation

02:41.180 --> 02:44.472
to support your completely
not-infirm client.

02:44.472 --> 02:47.930
He should get a job.
Shovel snow, drive a cab,

02:47.930 --> 02:49.888
sell one of those
ridiculous flop-houses.

02:49.888 --> 02:52.555
Flip house, Elaine.
Saw what you did there.

02:52.555 --> 02:54.680
It is a sound
investment.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.763
Robert gets
the children for dinners

02:56.763 --> 02:58.638
- on Wednesdays
and Saturdays.
- Mm-hmm.

02:58.638 --> 03:00.055
Until he gets the walls
on the bathroom

03:00.055 --> 03:01.596
of your
"sound investment,"

03:01.596 --> 03:03.055
they do not
spend the night.

03:03.055 --> 03:05.930
I'd also like
my Eagles albums.

03:05.930 --> 03:08.180
- "Hotel California",

03:08.180 --> 03:13.264
- "Live", and "Best Of,"
volumes one and two.
- Fine, whatever.

03:13.264 --> 03:15.305
You know, I'm just
gonna step in here
and remind you both

03:15.305 --> 03:16.596
that these are
important decisions,

03:16.596 --> 03:18.264
and Elaine and I
are more than happy

03:18.264 --> 03:20.097
- to do another
go-round on the docs.
- Absolutely.

03:20.097 --> 03:22.514
We should officially
enter the Eagles into
the agreement.

03:22.514 --> 03:25.389
Honestly, we have been
doing this for weeks!

03:25.389 --> 03:29.097
I'm very happy to go
on the record right now
and say in front of everybody

03:29.097 --> 03:33.180
that Robert can have all
of the Eagles albums, okay?

03:33.180 --> 03:36.264
One last one.
There you go.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.763
Congratulations.

03:43.763 --> 03:47.472
- Ah, yeah.

03:47.472 --> 03:48.805
Good luck.

03:48.805 --> 03:50.763
You going
to the Southern
District dinner?

03:50.763 --> 03:52.472
- Like I've got
a fucking choice?

03:52.472 --> 03:55.138
I just go
to see Judge Werner
get shit-faced every year.

03:55.138 --> 03:56.930
- Best part.

03:56.930 --> 03:58.596
The after-party
is fucked-up.

03:58.596 --> 04:00.555
- Tony: Sure is.
- Yeah.

04:08.888 --> 04:10.680
Here, do you wanna...?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.472
- Oh.
- Go.

04:12.472 --> 04:14.180
Ooh!

04:17.846 --> 04:20.013
You going back
to Hastings?

04:20.013 --> 04:21.721
Yeah, the 2:49.

04:21.721 --> 04:24.097
- Yeah, me, too.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.638
- Man: Taxi!

04:36.514 --> 04:39.180
Man over P.A.:
Train to Poughkeepsie
now arriving at track one.

04:39.180 --> 04:40.721
Train to Poughkeepsie,
track one.

04:44.055 --> 04:46.555
- Hello.
- There you are.

04:49.097 --> 04:51.305
So how did it go?

04:51.305 --> 04:54.888
Uh, not what
I expected.

04:54.888 --> 04:58.347
You know, I mean,
after all the really
painful stuff,

04:58.347 --> 05:00.888
the thing that you'd think
would be hardest--

05:00.888 --> 05:02.930
the actually signing
of the divorce papers--

05:02.930 --> 05:06.222
it just...
wasn't hard at all.

05:06.222 --> 05:10.389
It was like, um--
it was like nothing,
you know?

05:10.389 --> 05:12.180
It's like one minute,
you're married,
and the next minute,

05:12.180 --> 05:13.888
it's like,
"Yeah, bye-bye,
see ya, nice knowing ya."

05:13.888 --> 05:15.430
Anticlimactic
is good.

05:15.430 --> 05:17.389
You don't want any
last minute fireworks.

05:17.389 --> 05:19.430
- Trust me.
- No, you're right,
you're right.

05:19.430 --> 05:22.472
So, uh, yeah,
what now?

05:22.472 --> 05:27.555
You know, I'm realizing that
I spent so much time focusing
on what might happen today

05:27.555 --> 05:31.097
that I just
didn't let myself
think about the future.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.389
- Mm-hmm.

05:33.389 --> 05:37.222
So, now what?
I'm divorced.

05:38.888 --> 05:41.930
- I'm officially divorced.
- It's a milestone.

05:41.930 --> 05:44.389
I went out and got a tattoo
of a tiny bird on my ass

05:44.389 --> 05:46.430
- when my divorce
was finalized.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.055
Yeah, it started out
as Snow White holding
a tiny bird,

05:49.055 --> 05:51.097
but I couldn't
handle the pain, so.

05:51.097 --> 05:52.721
Dallas.

05:52.721 --> 05:55.721
- Robert.
- Hi.

05:55.721 --> 05:58.264
- Same train, different car.
- After what he pulled,

05:58.264 --> 06:01.721
I can't even
imagine you staying
in the same state as him.

06:01.721 --> 06:03.472
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

06:03.472 --> 06:07.013
Get out of the way.
Yeah, no, it was, um--

06:07.013 --> 06:08.430
you know,
it was awful.

06:08.430 --> 06:10.222
But I know
he regrets it,

06:10.222 --> 06:11.972
and I need to
move on, you know?

06:11.972 --> 06:13.805
I need to clear out
all the old shit

06:13.805 --> 06:15.972
and just start fresh.

06:15.972 --> 06:20.347
You know, I want our--
I want our home to
be happy again.

06:20.347 --> 06:24.846
- I want the kids to be good.
- Make sure to take care
of Frances, too, okay?

06:24.846 --> 06:27.680
Thanks.
Frances will be A-OK.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.389
Okay, I have to go.
I have a client emergency.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.972
Really, I'm not
your biggest emergency?

06:31.972 --> 06:34.805
- Ugh, not by far.
- Well, that's good news!

06:37.514 --> 06:40.472
Hey, thanks
for seeing me.

06:40.472 --> 06:42.805
Of course.
Come in.

06:47.805 --> 06:50.805
Hold on a second,
when you said,
"Come in here,"

06:50.805 --> 06:52.596
you meant, like,
"come in you," right?

06:52.596 --> 06:55.680
- Oh, Jesus,
don't talk.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.805
Show me that little birdie,
you hot fucking minx!

06:57.805 --> 06:59.763
- Come on.
No!

06:59.763 --> 07:01.930
Oh, my God!

07:03.680 --> 07:06.138
Oh, toilet paper.
Goody, goody, goody.

07:06.138 --> 07:10.347
Why'd you leave your job
if it means that we can't
have normal cereal?

07:11.888 --> 07:16.638
Well, 'cause the company
was restructuring.

07:17.846 --> 07:19.430
You know,
they were getting--

07:19.430 --> 07:21.514
they were getting
smaller, and...

07:21.514 --> 07:23.888
they needed people
to leave.

07:23.888 --> 07:25.180
And they...

07:27.264 --> 07:30.180
they actually
paid me to go.

07:30.180 --> 07:34.347
You know, it's a--
a fantastic opportunity.

07:34.347 --> 07:37.805
And, really,
kind of fortuitous
timing, right?

07:37.805 --> 07:42.305
I mean, I--
it allowed for me to
spend more time with you guys,

07:42.305 --> 07:43.763
which is exactly
what I wanted.

07:43.763 --> 07:49.180
And I could
really concentrate
on the gallery.

07:49.180 --> 07:51.180
Man on P.A.:
Can I get a pallet
lifter to 14, please?

07:51.180 --> 07:53.763
Yeah, okay,
we'll get this
in the normal store.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.514
( train horn blaring
in distance )

08:40.138 --> 08:41.763
Hmm.

08:49.596 --> 08:52.596
July 2008?
Jesus.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.472
Hmm.

09:52.638 --> 09:54.888
We gotta mop the floor,
install the glass,

09:54.888 --> 09:56.805
paint the walls,
and get you a door.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.846
- Exactly.
- I'm a bit shorthanded.

09:59.846 --> 10:01.846
I lost three
of my best guys
last week.

10:01.846 --> 10:03.514
Goddamn deportations.

10:03.514 --> 10:05.763
- No, they just
got better jobs.
- Oh.

10:05.763 --> 10:08.013
So, look,
you're the boss.

10:08.013 --> 10:09.638
Right now,
we're looking
at a month or two,

10:09.638 --> 10:11.596
and it'll cost you
around 10K.

10:11.596 --> 10:16.180
Craig, it's a shitter,
it's not the White House.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.972
I understand that.
I'm just being honest.

10:17.972 --> 10:20.347
You give me a deposit
and I get started.

10:25.055 --> 10:27.555
Listen,

10:27.555 --> 10:30.222
I know you're against it
with money right now.

10:30.222 --> 10:31.972
I want you
to have your kids.

10:31.972 --> 10:34.055
You know how to
hang drywall, right?

10:34.055 --> 10:37.347
I mean, I worked
construction through college.

10:37.347 --> 10:40.222
I need some expert hands.
I'm just putting it out there.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.389
Pays 20 bucks
an hour.

10:42.389 --> 10:44.972
That is a generous
offer, Craig,

10:44.972 --> 10:46.389
and I appreciate
the reach out,

10:46.389 --> 10:49.888
but I got a few irons
in the fire still.

10:49.888 --> 10:53.389
Yeah, in fact, I'm late
for a meeting in the city.

10:53.389 --> 10:57.555
- Maybe you noticed
the suit and tie, huh?
- I did.

10:57.555 --> 10:59.680
I thought maybe
you were going to
a funeral or something.

11:02.222 --> 11:06.180
- Good morning, Frances!

11:06.180 --> 11:07.596
- Good morning.

11:07.596 --> 11:09.472
Ta-da!

11:09.472 --> 11:11.721
- This is to celebrate your
papers being signed...
- Aw.

11:11.721 --> 11:14.180
...and for me officially
investing in the gallery.

11:14.180 --> 11:17.596
Thank you, thank you.
But it's a loan.

11:17.596 --> 11:20.055
It's a loan.
I'm paying you back.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.846
La, la, la, la, la!
I can't hear you.

11:21.846 --> 11:24.347
Nobody deserves Nick's money
more than you, except me.

11:24.347 --> 11:26.472
Aw, that's very,
very sentimental.

11:26.472 --> 11:28.222
I thought, uh--

11:28.222 --> 11:30.389
I thought you
weren't imbibing.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.930
I'm not.
I'll just
watch you drink.

11:32.930 --> 11:35.930
So how are you
doing, Frances?
Are you doing okay?

11:35.930 --> 11:38.846
Uh, I will be once I get
a decent night's sleep.

11:38.846 --> 11:41.430
Oh, my goodness,
why didn't you say so?

11:41.430 --> 11:42.972
Here.

11:42.972 --> 11:45.721
Try this-- Xanax.
It'll knock you
right out.

11:45.721 --> 11:47.763
I took two of these
last week before yoga

11:47.763 --> 11:49.930
and I woke up
four hours later
in Zumba.

11:49.930 --> 11:52.097
Can you believe people
are still doing Zumba?

11:52.097 --> 11:53.763
I don't know,
I'm not really a big fan

11:53.763 --> 11:56.930
- of taking pills.
- Oh, please, neither am I.

11:56.930 --> 11:59.347
But you're going through
a very big transition,
Frances.

11:59.347 --> 12:02.097
I mean, break ups are hard.
Hell, marriages are hard.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.888
Yeah, I know that.

12:03.888 --> 12:05.596
I mean,
up until a week ago,

12:05.596 --> 12:07.180
I literally wanted
to kill Nick.

12:07.180 --> 12:09.972
You did literally
try and kill him.

12:09.972 --> 12:11.638
Oh, that's old news!

12:11.638 --> 12:13.222
You know, we've been
doing this exercise

12:13.222 --> 12:14.805
out of this
relationship book.

12:14.805 --> 12:16.972
It's called
"The Positive Proposition,"

12:16.972 --> 12:18.638
and it has totally
saved us!

12:18.638 --> 12:20.138
The way
the book works

12:20.138 --> 12:22.138
is you're not
supposed to say
anything to your partner

12:22.138 --> 12:23.805
unless it's a compliment
or something positive.

12:23.805 --> 12:25.805
So because Nick and I
have nothing good to say
to each other,

12:25.805 --> 12:28.097
it's just silent
all the time,

12:28.097 --> 12:30.180
and it's so sexy!

12:32.138 --> 12:35.180
- The quiet just
builds up and builds up,

12:35.180 --> 12:36.805
then all you feel
is this--

12:36.805 --> 12:38.888
this kind of
primal attraction
to one another.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.805
I mean, thank God
Nick is at the office
most of the day

12:40.805 --> 12:42.514
so our time together
is limited,

12:42.514 --> 12:44.305
but it's still
so wonderful.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.763
I mean, if all it takes
is silence, distance,

12:46.763 --> 12:49.305
and a compliment
here and there,

12:49.305 --> 12:50.846
marriages should
last forever.

12:50.846 --> 12:52.805
Oh, I'm not saying
it's for everybody.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.805
I mean, in your case,
I certainly don't think
it would've mattered.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.264
Hmm, you're being
so quiet.

13:00.264 --> 13:03.805
Oh, I get it,
you're "positive
propositioning" me, aren't you?

13:03.805 --> 13:05.846
Oh!

13:05.846 --> 13:08.180
- Man: Jesus!

13:08.180 --> 13:10.264
Bobby, ha!

13:10.264 --> 13:12.805
- How long has
it been, huh?
- 11 years.

13:12.805 --> 13:15.389
- Seems like it was
just yesterday, though, huh?

13:15.389 --> 13:17.389
Remember that time
we took the guy to Luger's

13:17.389 --> 13:20.180
and he choked on
a piece of his
porterhouse?

13:20.180 --> 13:23.013
Yeah! And then
you were like,
"I got it!"

13:23.013 --> 13:25.013
And you Heimliched him
so hard, he broke a rib!

13:25.013 --> 13:27.305
I saved that
son of a bitch's life!

13:27.305 --> 13:28.472
Then he sued you.

13:28.472 --> 13:30.055
- What an asshole.
- Asshole!

13:30.055 --> 13:32.514
Ah, Peter.

13:32.514 --> 13:35.222
So is this office
big enough for you?

13:35.222 --> 13:38.222
Yeah, I'm one
of those douches now.

13:38.222 --> 13:39.805
So how's Frances?

13:39.805 --> 13:43.721
She, uh,
is divorced.

13:43.721 --> 13:45.055
From me.

13:45.055 --> 13:47.930
Oh, man,
sorry to hear.

13:49.472 --> 13:51.389
Woman:
Ballard is here
for his 4:00.

13:51.389 --> 13:53.888
Oh, three minutes.

13:55.763 --> 13:57.972
Pete,
here's the deal.

13:57.972 --> 14:01.389
I'm thinking
about getting back
into finance, you know?

14:01.389 --> 14:03.389
Come to work for
a firm like this,

14:03.389 --> 14:04.721
maybe as
a money manager.

14:04.721 --> 14:07.222
I used to crush it
at the client speak.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.721
I closed every day,
all day.

14:09.721 --> 14:12.013
The reason for that--
people like me,

14:12.013 --> 14:15.805
they can understand me
both on the phone
and in person.

14:15.805 --> 14:19.389
Very likable, Peter.
Very, very likable.

14:19.389 --> 14:22.222
- And being likable
is a fucking dying art.

14:24.222 --> 14:26.389
- Woman: Ballard's wait--
- I know.

14:26.389 --> 14:29.721
Look, Robert, I'm sorry.

14:29.721 --> 14:31.514
I just--
I don't have anything.

14:31.514 --> 14:33.264
I wish I did.

14:34.555 --> 14:37.222
All right, well,
very likable.

14:37.222 --> 14:39.264
- It's your loss.
- Good luck.

14:44.138 --> 14:45.846
Son of a bitch.

14:45.846 --> 14:47.596
Come on, Lila,
push it.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.972
Give it to Lexi.
Good. Go, Lex!

14:50.972 --> 14:52.222
Put it up.
Good shot!

14:52.222 --> 14:53.596
- Ah!
- Crowd: Oh!

14:53.596 --> 14:55.138
- Halftime!

14:55.138 --> 14:58.138
All right,
let's bring it in,
ladies, bring it in.

14:58.138 --> 15:00.305
All right,

15:00.305 --> 15:02.555
let's start off
with the highlights.

15:02.555 --> 15:05.222
Good D, Sasha,
all right?

15:05.222 --> 15:07.805
Bridget, didn't have to
hit your inhaler till
10 minutes in.

15:07.805 --> 15:10.180
All right, now to
the lowlights.

15:10.180 --> 15:13.180
- We are getting
our heinies kicked.
- We suck.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.389
We have a whole second half
to turn this thing around.

15:15.389 --> 15:17.638
Let's don't focus
on the negative.

15:17.638 --> 15:21.138
We're not gonna focus
on Maya missing a layup.

15:21.138 --> 15:23.347
Look, we've all
made mistakes.

15:23.347 --> 15:28.305
Like the number of times
that I've asked a woman,
"Hey, when's your baby due?"

15:28.305 --> 15:31.472
And it just turned out
that she was, you know,
big-boned around the middle.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.846
Or, you know, I could fixate
on the mistakes I made
in my marriage.

15:34.846 --> 15:39.222
Like the time I gave
my wife, Frances, a parrot
for our fifth anniversary,

15:39.222 --> 15:41.846
when she had never
demonstrated any interest
in parrots

15:41.846 --> 15:44.514
- or, actually,
birds in general.
- Dad!

15:44.514 --> 15:45.972
Okay,
here's the point.

15:45.972 --> 15:47.846
I took the parrot
back to the pet store

15:47.846 --> 15:49.222
and they found him
a new home.

15:49.222 --> 15:52.138
A home full of love
and appreciation

15:52.138 --> 15:54.180
and, apparently,
eight bedrooms.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.888
So overnight,
that parrot was a winner,

15:56.888 --> 15:58.763
living in
a mansion, Bridget.

15:58.763 --> 16:00.222
And the lesson
to be learned here

16:00.222 --> 16:03.055
is that we can
turn this around
right away.

16:03.055 --> 16:05.222
We make
our future, okay?

16:05.222 --> 16:07.680
I want you guys
to go out there
in the second half,

16:07.680 --> 16:10.680
and I want you to crush it,
and be the parrot!

16:10.680 --> 16:13.180
- Okay, on three, kill.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.846
- One, two, three, kill!
- Girls: Kill!

16:46.763 --> 16:49.596
Hey, I'm Mitch.
You must be Robert.

16:49.596 --> 16:51.555
- Come on in.
- Yeah, okay.

16:51.555 --> 16:53.055
Thank you, Mitch.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.013
- That's Diego and Jeb.

16:56.013 --> 16:57.472
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

16:57.472 --> 16:59.638
- Hey, Jeb.

16:59.638 --> 17:01.763
- All right.
- They were Tony
clients, too.

17:01.763 --> 17:04.930
You know,
when he called about you,
I was like, "Hell, yes!"

17:04.930 --> 17:07.013
We got the Silvercreek
fan club

17:07.013 --> 17:10.180
going on up in here
at 64 Bonnymeade!

17:10.180 --> 17:13.472
You're in luck 'cause
Mikey moved out last week.

17:13.472 --> 17:15.680
He left all his sheets
and an old bathing suit,

17:15.680 --> 17:17.763
so those are totally
up for grabs.

17:17.763 --> 17:21.055
You know, I'm a BYO
bathing suit kind of a guy.

17:21.055 --> 17:23.888
But, look, this is just
a short-term situation

17:23.888 --> 17:26.721
so that I can finish
fixing up my house.

17:26.721 --> 17:28.638
Just need a place
where my kids can
spend the night.

17:28.638 --> 17:30.763
And the random "girlfriend"
in quotes, right?

17:30.763 --> 17:33.138
Don't have a girlfriend
presently, Mitch,

17:33.138 --> 17:35.555
but, uh,
working on it.

17:37.888 --> 17:40.305
The basement is
a perfect play room.

17:40.305 --> 17:41.972
Your kids
are gonna love it.

17:41.972 --> 17:45.097
Dude, this room
is not for children.

17:45.097 --> 17:47.805
- That's a fucking bong.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.680
My shrink says I've got
some childhood issues
I'm working through.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.763
Tony hooked
me up with her--
Dallas Holt.

17:53.763 --> 17:55.472
She's giving me
a deal.

17:55.472 --> 17:57.180
Not just 'cause
Tony's boning her.

17:57.180 --> 18:00.721
Tony's boning Dallas?

18:00.721 --> 18:02.097
A strong choice.

18:03.222 --> 18:04.638
Nice mustache.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.514
Fuck.

18:37.472 --> 18:42.305
♪ Some expression
in your eyes... ♪

18:42.305 --> 18:44.972
Adios, fucker.

18:44.972 --> 18:48.638

18:51.180 --> 18:53.347

19:14.430 --> 19:20.055

Hmm.

20:25.972 --> 20:29.305
Hey, Lila, how's it going?

20:29.305 --> 20:30.805
Hey, Dad.

20:30.805 --> 20:32.555
Ah!

20:32.555 --> 20:34.097
What are you
doing here?!

20:34.097 --> 20:36.555
Honey, is something wrong?
Is everything okay?

20:36.555 --> 20:38.347
No, I just wanted to
spend the night with you.

20:38.347 --> 20:42.472
Aw, honey.
Aw, you know
you can't do that.

20:42.472 --> 20:43.972
It's against
the rules.

20:43.972 --> 20:47.097
I'm being the parrot.
I'm changing my future.

20:47.097 --> 20:52.013
Well, hey, fist bump on
remembering my coaching, okay?

20:52.013 --> 20:53.638
I miss you.

20:53.638 --> 20:55.097
I miss you,
too, honey,

20:55.097 --> 20:58.305
but I don't even have
a toilet that works.

20:58.305 --> 20:59.805
So? I can hold it.

21:01.638 --> 21:03.305
Does your mom
know you're here?

21:04.930 --> 21:07.222
Oh, come on, honey.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.389
- We gotta get you home.
- No, Dad!

21:10.013 --> 21:12.888
I want to live
with you, not her.

21:15.596 --> 21:17.846
All right, look, honey,
here's the deal.

21:17.846 --> 21:21.180
I don't have a place
for you to stay yet.

21:21.180 --> 21:25.514
As fabulous as this house
is going to be one day,

21:25.514 --> 21:27.846
it doesn't count,
apparently.

21:27.846 --> 21:30.514
I mean, yes,
I could sell the house

21:30.514 --> 21:32.305
and get
a crappy apartment,

21:32.305 --> 21:35.638
but the problem is
the market is down
and no one is buying.

21:35.638 --> 21:38.555
I just have to wait for
the market to improve.

21:38.555 --> 21:41.430
And it's gonna be,
like, maybe June.

21:41.430 --> 21:44.347
I don't wanna wait
until June.

22:12.638 --> 22:14.305
A stupid place
for that.

22:14.305 --> 22:16.721
Right over
the heating vent.

22:16.721 --> 22:19.097
It's a fire hazard.

22:19.097 --> 22:21.721
- Robert: Yeah.

22:21.721 --> 22:24.763
Lila biked over
to my house last night.

22:24.763 --> 22:26.721
What?!

22:26.721 --> 22:29.638
Lila, you can't
ride your bike in
the middle of the night!

22:29.638 --> 22:32.596
- That's incredibly
dangerous!
- I was fine.

22:32.596 --> 22:34.430
No!

22:34.430 --> 22:37.097
Oh, my God,
McMillan doesn't even
have a stop light.

22:37.097 --> 22:39.180
People are hit there
in broad daylight!

22:39.180 --> 22:40.888
- Oh, my God!

22:40.888 --> 22:42.596
Why didn't you
call me?

22:42.596 --> 22:44.763
I tried.
You didn't pick up.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.264
Oh, that's
'cause I--

22:47.264 --> 22:50.222
'cause I took a Xanax,
well, half a Xanax.

22:50.222 --> 22:51.680
And then I took
the other half,

22:51.680 --> 22:53.680
which was basically
just dust.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.805
So you're
popping pills now?

22:55.805 --> 22:57.638
No wonder Lila wants
to live with me.

22:57.638 --> 22:59.888
No, I am not
popping pills--

22:59.888 --> 23:01.596
are you kidding me?

23:01.596 --> 23:03.430
Just saying she's not
a big Frances fan.

23:03.430 --> 23:06.721
I am not the biggest
Frances fan right now either
when I'm with her

23:06.721 --> 23:09.972
because I am the one
that always has to
say no to her.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.389
I'm the one that makes her
eat generic cereal

23:12.389 --> 23:15.305
so I can support us
and keep the gallery going.

23:15.305 --> 23:17.305
And you're the good guy.
You're the fun one.

23:17.305 --> 23:19.763
You're the, you know,
crazy dad

23:19.763 --> 23:22.138
who-- who takes us
to Applebee's

23:22.138 --> 23:26.097
and lives in
an open-air tree house!

23:27.638 --> 23:28.472
Here.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.805
I have no idea why
you have three putters.

23:33.805 --> 23:35.805
And I am not
a narcissist.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.805
I know because
I read the book

23:37.805 --> 23:39.013
and I took the quiz.

23:39.013 --> 23:41.846
And yet you still thought
it was about you.

23:41.846 --> 23:43.805
Oh, my gosh!

23:43.805 --> 23:45.555
No, I'm not
doing this with you.

23:45.555 --> 23:48.638
- I'm not doing it.
- Okay.

23:50.805 --> 23:52.138
You shaved
your mustache.

23:54.514 --> 23:56.222
I did.

23:56.222 --> 23:58.180
It looks good.

23:58.180 --> 24:01.347
Yeah, 'cause
your face looks,

24:01.347 --> 24:04.763
you know,
like, less...

24:04.763 --> 24:06.389
Is that a compliment?

24:06.389 --> 24:09.930
That sounds like
a semi-compliment.

24:09.930 --> 24:12.680
Yeah, yeah, it is.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.680
You cut your hair.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.638
Oh, yeah,
just a little bit.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.721
Thanks for the putters.

24:26.180 --> 24:28.721
- Nick: Ah!

24:33.805 --> 24:36.846
Diane,
I have to tell you,

24:36.846 --> 24:40.846
the last week
has been just amazing.

24:42.430 --> 24:45.055
Just you and I, us.

24:45.055 --> 24:48.180
I hate saying goodbye
nonverbally

24:48.180 --> 24:49.680
to you
in the morning.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.888
I know, me, too.

24:55.763 --> 24:58.222
I wanna spend
more time with you,
my love.

24:58.222 --> 25:00.555
You do?

25:00.555 --> 25:04.264
Maybe we should
go down to Miami
for the long weekend.

25:04.264 --> 25:06.222
Have a real
vacation.

25:09.222 --> 25:12.680
I was thinking
something bigger.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.930
Rome?
Paris?!

25:14.930 --> 25:16.680
Paris!

25:16.680 --> 25:20.097
Or we could do
that meditation safari
we've always wanted to do.

25:20.097 --> 25:22.389
I'm going to retire.

25:26.138 --> 25:27.763
Diane?

25:30.389 --> 25:32.264
Say something.

25:32.264 --> 25:35.430
It's... great.

25:40.972 --> 25:43.013
Hello, chickadees.

25:43.013 --> 25:44.514
How was school?

25:44.514 --> 25:46.972
- It was okay.

25:46.972 --> 25:49.264
Okay is okay!

25:49.264 --> 25:50.721
Lila?

25:50.721 --> 25:52.055
Fine.

25:52.055 --> 25:54.638
Fine?
Fine's better
than okay.

25:54.638 --> 25:55.888
Follow me.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.972
I have a surprise
for you both out back.

25:58.972 --> 26:00.305
Okay.

26:02.013 --> 26:03.972
You bought
a trampoline?

26:03.972 --> 26:05.222
Yes, I did.

26:05.222 --> 26:06.638
Indeed,
I did, yes.

26:06.638 --> 26:08.763
It was gently used
on craigslist,

26:08.763 --> 26:10.430
so forget about
the old swing set

26:10.430 --> 26:13.514
'cause the future
is trampolines.

26:13.514 --> 26:16.180
Remember how you
always wanted one, Tom?

26:16.180 --> 26:18.305
Yeah, that was
on my Christmas list
in like, 2010.

26:18.305 --> 26:21.138
Then Merry Christmas!
Let's give it a whirl!

26:21.138 --> 26:24.013
We'll all do it together.
We'll give her a little
test run.

26:26.805 --> 26:28.472
Ooh, God, wow!

26:28.472 --> 26:31.430
Took some
unexpected core work.

26:31.430 --> 26:33.472
Okay.

26:33.472 --> 26:35.472
Oh.

26:35.472 --> 26:36.972
Oh!

26:36.972 --> 26:40.222
Oh, my God,
it's so good!

26:40.222 --> 26:41.888
Lila,
get on up here!

26:41.888 --> 26:44.138
- No, thanks.
- Oh!

26:44.138 --> 26:46.930
Tom, you know
you want to.

26:46.930 --> 26:48.680
Yeah,
I kind of don't.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.180
Oh, you kind of do!

26:50.180 --> 26:52.138
Your legs
are saying yes.

26:52.138 --> 26:54.555
Don't let
your head say no.

26:54.555 --> 26:56.264
Lila, come on!

26:56.264 --> 26:58.680
It's so good!
It's awesome.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.930
It's better
than I remembered.

27:00.930 --> 27:03.305
We'll bounce together.
Get up here.

27:03.305 --> 27:04.680
Come on, look!

27:04.680 --> 27:05.930
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

27:05.930 --> 27:07.930
Remember this
crazy maneuver?

27:07.930 --> 27:09.680
Ow!

FRANCES DUFRESNE:
I'm just starting the process

30:55.347 --> 30:56.097
of changing my name.

30:56.305 --> 30:58.055
-I just got divorced.
-Oh, bummer.

30:58.055 --> 30:59.097
Not really.

31:00.472 --> 31:02.805
I'm the bad guy,
he's the noble one.

31:02.805 --> 31:05.472
I got sole custody
of Lila's inner-bitch.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.680
You're not going to work
like that, are you?

31:07.680 --> 31:08.763
You look freaky.

31:09.721 --> 31:12.097
DIANE: Frances,
I would like you to meet Andrew.

31:12.097 --> 31:13.596
Did you know about this?

31:13.596 --> 31:15.222
Full disclosure,
you are not the first person

31:15.222 --> 31:16.596
Diane has set me up with.

31:17.514 --> 31:19.305
You're single.
You're a free man.

31:19.680 --> 31:20.846
You want me to pee on you?

31:20.846 --> 31:22.930
That is a generous offer,
Janice.

31:23.264 --> 31:24.930
Uh, but I'm gonna pass.
