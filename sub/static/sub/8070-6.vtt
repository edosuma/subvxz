00:16.184 --> 00:18.886
Not now, Dan.

00:18.986 --> 00:22.256
OK, but hurry up.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.158
This mattress is killing me.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.460
I've got a spring right
in the middle of my back.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.361
So move.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.896
I tried that.

00:28.996 --> 00:29.997
Well, try again.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.209
Switch sides
with me, Roseanne.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.710
No.

00:42.810 --> 00:43.577
Come on.

00:43.677 --> 00:44.678
I've got to get some sleep.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.628
I can't sleep with
your hot nostril air

01:00.728 --> 01:03.397
blowing all over me.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.432
Turn over.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.399
No, you.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.400
Oh, fine.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.310
Oh.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.278
What?

01:17.378 --> 01:18.912
I'm still not happy.

01:19.012 --> 01:19.880
Come on.

01:19.980 --> 01:20.981
Help me flip the mattress over.

01:21.081 --> 01:21.882
OK.

01:26.954 --> 01:27.755
Come on, Rosanne.

01:27.855 --> 01:28.889
You've got to get up.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.058
Well, you didn't tell
me what was part of it.

01:31.159 --> 01:31.959
Come on.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.238
Oh.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.208
Oh. good, good, good,
good, good, good, good.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.114
Ow.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.918
We need to get a new bed.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.220
You mean a brand new bed?

01:59.320 --> 02:02.923
No, one some old
person died in.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.193
We'll talk about tomorrow.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.093
Oh.

02:09.897 --> 02:13.901
Dan, now you're all
comfy on account of I've

02:14.001 --> 02:15.869
got the spring on my side now.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.845
All right, but hurry up.

[coughing]

03:19.833 --> 03:20.868
[coughing]

03:21.702 --> 03:22.603
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.504
I mean it.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.972
I mean it.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.307
Cut it out, creep.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.308
Cut it out, creep.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.276
- Dad.
- Dad.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.176
Hm?

03:29.277 --> 03:30.143
It's DJ.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.078
It's DJ.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.012
I'm going to kill him.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.381
- I'm going to kill him.
- Why?

03:33.481 --> 03:34.282
What's he doing?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.418
- Mom.
- Mom.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.419
ROSEANNE: What?

03:38.519 --> 03:39.953
Darlene's saying
everything DJ says

03:40.053 --> 03:41.489
a second before he says it.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.597
God, that's so immature.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.131
He's driving me crazy.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.333
DJ: Crazy.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.901
If he doesn't cut it out,
there's no telling what

03:54.001 --> 03:54.868
might happen to him.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.236
Happen to him.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.639
Hey, Darlene, do you ever
think about banging your head

03:58.739 --> 04:00.708
on the table real hard?

04:00.808 --> 04:04.244
Maybe he'll knock himself out.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.446
Thank you very much.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.747
- Thank you very much.
- You're dead.

04:06.847 --> 04:07.648
You're dead.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.521
How's it going?

04:13.621 --> 04:14.422
How's it going?

04:18.626 --> 04:21.629
Funny you should ask because
you know what, Rodbells

04:21.729 --> 04:23.263
is having a sale on bed, OK?

04:23.364 --> 04:24.632
40% off.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.768
And that coupled with my
employee discount, 20%,

04:27.868 --> 04:31.138
I think somebody is trying
to tell us something.

04:31.238 --> 04:36.710
Roseanne, I've been thinking,
what if my manly abilities

04:36.810 --> 04:37.945
aren't really mine?

04:38.045 --> 04:38.846
What if it's the mattress?

04:43.016 --> 04:45.419
I thought it was the mattress.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.554
No.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.789
I mean, what if I can't
wow you in a new bed?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.458
Well, you didn't have
no trouble when we brought

04:50.558 --> 04:51.725
home that new kitchen table.

04:54.928 --> 04:55.729
True.

04:58.632 --> 05:02.302
If anybody cares, DJ's head
fits really well in the toilet.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.303
See, Dan.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.706
I told you, DJ is
small for his age.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.074
[car horn honking]

05:07.174 --> 05:08.008
See ya.

05:08.108 --> 05:08.909
Whoa.

05:09.009 --> 05:09.877
Where are you going?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.111
I told you, Mom.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.481
His name is Mark Healey
and we're going to a party.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.382
Healey?

05:14.482 --> 05:15.749
Healey?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.217
Healey?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.319
I don't really know any
Healeys, do we, dear?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.488
I don't know.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.655
Does his father bowl?

05:21.755 --> 05:22.623
Oh, god.

05:22.723 --> 05:23.791
[car horn honking]

05:23.891 --> 05:25.859
Not a league man, eh?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.728
Perhaps we've run
into them while dining

05:27.828 --> 05:28.796
at Spaghetti Bucket.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.200
I don't recall, Lovey.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.437
Maybe they're not the
all-you-can-eat type.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.438
Oh god, Dan.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.474
You don't think
they're nouveau poor.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.442
[car horn honking]

05:41.542 --> 05:42.510
Please let me go.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.911
No.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.813
It's your first date with the
guy, we're going to meet him.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.448
Well, can't you meet
him like some other time?

05:47.548 --> 05:48.382
We're kind of in a hurry.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.250
You know the way
it works, Beck.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.485
He's just sitting out there.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.920
He'll think I'm ditching him.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.155
Well, then let him make that
long, lonely walk to the door

05:55.255 --> 05:56.624
and find out.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.025
[knock at door]
- I'll get it.

05:58.125 --> 05:58.926
No, Darlene.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.327
No.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.295
We're going to embarrass your
sister in an orderly fashion.

06:12.906 --> 06:13.941
God, I hate this family.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.311
What's going on?

06:18.412 --> 06:19.346
I've been honking for an hour.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.247
Sorry.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.348
My parents want to meet you.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.249
Oh, man.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.153
Mom, Dad, this is Mark.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.188
Mark, these are my parents.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.189
Hi.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.691
Dan Connor This is
my wife, Roseanne.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.861
And of course, the
lovely Darlene.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.195
OK.
Let's go.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.164
Mark, I'm sure you'd love
to get the hell out of here,

06:37.264 --> 06:39.600
but that's not the
way we do things.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.734
No.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.670
So let's sit right down
here on the Davenport

06:42.770 --> 06:44.938
and get to know each
other a little bit better.

06:45.038 --> 06:45.906
Huh, honey?

06:50.678 --> 06:55.949
So Mark, what
grade you you in?

Ah, great.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.523
You play football?

07:02.623 --> 07:03.423
Nope.

07:03.524 --> 07:07.194
Oh, too bad.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.530
They've really got a
great team this year.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.598
I guess, yeah.

07:10.698 --> 07:11.499
Yeah.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.033
I heard your horn out there.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.772
What kind of car do you drive?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.207
It's not a car,
Dan; it's a truck.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.680
A-ha.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.581
Rosie?

07:30.751 --> 07:42.663
Well, Mark, uh, you got
anything you want to ask us?

Look, Mom, we've
really got to go.

Oh, how '70s.

of margaritas?

No salt.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.278
We're just looking.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.179
I'll be over there.

Oh.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.289
Hey, look.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.291
A bed like my mom
wanted us to get.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.227
Oh, look at this.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.328
Oh.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.998
That's twice as big
as the one we've got.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.866
Let's pretenD
we're rich and famous

08:52.966 --> 08:55.603
and we actually have a room big
enough for this bed to fit in.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.503
Yeah.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.905
Yeah.

08:58.005 --> 09:01.008
And we're waking up to the smell
of fresh coffee and croissants

09:01.108 --> 09:08.882
that our sexy French maid,
Pierre, has made for us.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.985
Hey, remember the
first time you told me

09:12.085 --> 09:15.155
you loved me on our little bed?

09:15.255 --> 09:16.489
No.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.658
Neither do I.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.227
But I know I did
and I still do.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.698
Boy, are you whipped.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.245
Should I get the hose?

09:38.345 --> 09:41.214
No, but you could
dim the lights.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.617
We're reminiscing.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.720
What a nice word for it.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.088
I see you decided
on the king size.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.189
No.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.660
We'll take that one
over there, the double.

09:52.760 --> 09:53.526
And for the lady?

09:58.932 --> 10:02.535
I'll just go write it up now.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.238
Way to defend my
honor there, Dan.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.274
I think it was a
shot at me, dear.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.175
Oh.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.345
Good one.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.354
A toast.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.289
A toast.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.490
- To our old bed.
- Oh.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.858
OK.

10:24.958 --> 10:29.697
Well, what was once the cradle
of our love is now landfill.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.099
That was good.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.000
OK.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.567
I'll stake my beer.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.468
Hey.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.436
Hey.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.739
Isn't that Becky's boyfriend?

10:38.839 --> 10:41.174
What the hell's he doing here?

10:41.274 --> 10:42.710
He looks like he's drinking.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.277
Where the hell are you going?
- Say hello.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.612
No.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.380
You'll get mad and you'll try
to punch him or something.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.615
Wait.
Just hold on.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.486
Uh, hey.

10:53.586 --> 10:54.454
Remember us?

10:54.554 --> 10:55.355
Oh, yeah.

10:57.791 --> 10:58.591
Fine.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.661
And you?

11:01.762 --> 11:02.662
I'm cool.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.497
Well, what are
you doing in here?

11:04.597 --> 11:05.833
What, are we going
to have another one

11:05.933 --> 11:06.734
of your little chats?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.037
Chat this!

11:10.137 --> 11:10.938
Honey.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.506
Honey, honey, honey.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.476
Uh, we were, uh-- we
were just wondering,

11:16.576 --> 11:18.178
how did you get in here?

11:18.278 --> 11:19.079
Through the door.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.249
No.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.818
I mean, you're only 18, right?

11:24.918 --> 11:26.019
Look, man.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.355
I've got a piece of paper
here that says I'm 21.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.390
Well, how old are you when
you're dating our daughter?

11:30.490 --> 11:31.424
Depends on where we're going.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.196
I'm going to ask
you the question again

11:36.296 --> 11:37.464
and I want you to
remember that you're

11:37.564 --> 11:38.531
talking to the girl's father.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.632
Give me a break.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.834
You're not going to touch me.

11:40.934 --> 11:41.735
Touch him, Dan.

11:41.835 --> 11:42.635
Touch him.

11:42.736 --> 11:43.670
Touch him!

11:43.771 --> 11:45.038
Rosie.

11:45.138 --> 11:45.939
All right.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.641
Mark, here's the deal.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.111
I don't want you hanging
around my daughter anymore.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.446
Oh, you think you can stop
me from seeing Becky, huh?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.082
I think I can stop you
from seeing tomorrow.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.485
Me, too.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.088
Fine.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.956
You know, if Becky wants
to see me, she'll see me.

12:03.056 --> 12:03.891
All right?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.129
I want to go over
to his house and beat

12:09.229 --> 12:10.197
the hell out of his mother.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.137
DJ: Come on, Darlene!

12:17.237 --> 12:19.639
Come on, Darlene.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.640
DJ: Let me out.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.609
Let me out.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.111
DJ: I won't do it anymore.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.113
I won't do it anymore.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.580
DJ: Please.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.083
Please.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.586
DJ: Mom, is that you?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.422
Darlene, what is that
little boy still doing up?

12:35.522 --> 12:36.523
DJ: Mom!

12:36.623 --> 12:37.724
Sorry, Mom.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.793
We were having so much
fun I lost track of time.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.429
Nice to see you two kids
are getting along so well.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.198
DJ: Dad, is that you?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.434
DJ, I want you
to go to bed now.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.768
DJ: But Mom.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.570
Now.

12:50.670 --> 12:51.471
All right.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.506
Let's go, squirt.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.674
Do it again and it's the dryer.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.813
Becky?

12:59.913 --> 13:01.982
Becky, get down here.

13:02.082 --> 13:02.883
Good night, Mom.

13:02.983 --> 13:03.783
Good night, Mom.

13:03.884 --> 13:07.520
I wasn't doing it.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.789
So what did I do this time?

13:09.890 --> 13:10.690
Nothing.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.925
Amazing, isn't it?

13:12.025 --> 13:15.328
- We saw Mark tonight.
- Where?

13:15.428 --> 13:18.731
Over at the Lobo,
and he was drinking.

13:18.832 --> 13:22.870
This may come as some big shock
to you, but he's got a fake ID.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.171
We told him to
stay away from you

13:24.271 --> 13:26.506
and we want you to
stay away from him.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.576
Now, come kiss
Mommy good night.

13:29.676 --> 13:30.543
I can't believe this.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.711
I just can't believe this.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.846
Believe it, Beck.

13:32.946 --> 13:33.780
Why?

13:33.881 --> 13:34.982
I don't go out
drinking with him.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.416
And you never will.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.385
How could you guys
embarrass me like this?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.353
This is so typical of
you guys to butt in where

13:40.453 --> 13:41.688
it's none of your business.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.390
Well, at least we
didn't let you down.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.992
You are our business
everything that happens--

13:45.092 --> 13:46.326
Hey, you have no
right to do this.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.260
Drop the Drop the attitude.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.929
--the greatest
guy I ever dated.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.397
And it's so obvious
you don't like him

13:50.497 --> 13:51.731
and you're just
taking it out on me.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.440
You know, I remember a
time when she was so sweet,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.675
so innocent, and so loving.

14:02.775 --> 14:03.977
I remember that, too.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.378
I believe it was a Thursday.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.687
Oh, listen to this one.

14:14.787 --> 14:18.091
I sometimes get tiny red pimples
on my buttocks in the summer.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.060
What can I do about them?

14:22.695 --> 14:23.696
That's gross.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.365
I hope you didn't sign
your name this time.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.736
I signed your name.

14:29.836 --> 14:32.672
What does it say to do?

14:32.772 --> 14:34.374
Use a healing facial mask.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.178
OK.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.214
I'm going to go pick up that
bed before the store closes.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.684
Hey, honey, on your way
back, could you [inaudible]

14:44.784 --> 14:47.120
a healing facial mask--

14:47.220 --> 14:50.690
for our butts!

14:50.790 --> 14:51.591
OK.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.496
Mom, I'm not going
to be in for dinner.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.131
I'm going over Judy's.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.599
Well, get your dad
to give you a ride.

14:59.699 --> 15:00.467
Oh, no.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.368
That's OK.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.469
I can just walk.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.370
OK.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.941
What are you guys going to do?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.343
I don't know, probably just
go to the movies or something.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.844
Hey, there's a great idea.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.746
Maybe me and Jackie
will go see something.

15:13.846 --> 15:14.647
Yeah.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.449
That's a good idea.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.518
Well, we don't really know
if we're going to movies.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.820
We're just going to
decide when we get there.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.955
Well, why don't
you call me when

15:22.055 --> 15:23.256
you get over there
to Judy's and let

15:23.356 --> 15:24.257
us know one way or the other.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.359
Maybe we'll bring you home.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.794
Fine.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.696
Oh, you know what?
I forgot my wallet.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.234
Well, there it is.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.268
She's going to go see Mark.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.503
Oh, yeah.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.440
The old going over to my
girlfriend's house routine.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.676
She's probably up there
right now working on plan B.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.347
Maybe it's a really dumb
story like Judy's parents are

15:47.447 --> 15:49.082
Amish and don't have a phone.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.586
I was only 11.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.927
Mom, me and Judy are just
going to be going to a party,

16:01.028 --> 16:02.162
OK?
- Oh, OK.

16:02.262 --> 16:07.567
Hey, is Mark going
to be at this party?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.637
Mom, you told me
never to see him again.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.739
What is that, a yes or no?

16:12.839 --> 16:14.274
No.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.876
Where is the party?

16:16.976 --> 16:17.877
I'm not sure.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.646
I'll just have to
call and give you

16:19.746 --> 16:21.548
the number when I get there.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.550
Well, why don't me and
Jackie drive you over there?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.618
We're bored.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.820
Well, you know, we may go
to this party, we may not.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.921
You know what?

16:29.022 --> 16:30.190
We're probably just
going to invite a couple

16:30.290 --> 16:31.924
of girls over to Judy's.

16:32.025 --> 16:35.028
And she goes for the safe.

16:35.128 --> 16:35.928
Oh.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.297
OK.
- OK.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.565
Oh, Becky?

16:38.665 --> 16:39.466
Yeah?

16:43.002 --> 16:46.139
Um, Judy's phone
number's up there

16:46.239 --> 16:48.708
on the bulletin board, right?

16:48.808 --> 16:50.610
Yeah.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.844
- OK.
- OK.

16:51.944 --> 16:52.712
- Have fun.
- All right.

16:52.812 --> 16:53.680
Bye.
- Bye.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.852
Well, there she goes.

16:59.952 --> 17:00.753
Are you worried?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.889
Of course I'm worried, Jackie.

17:02.989 --> 17:03.790
Should we talk about it?

17:03.890 --> 17:05.625
What's there to talk about?

17:05.725 --> 17:09.129
She's out with some guy we
hate going god knows where

17:09.229 --> 17:10.297
and doing god knows what.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.567
Now I feel like
Mom must have felt

17:14.667 --> 17:16.169
when she had to sit
back and watch you

17:16.269 --> 17:17.770
completely destroy your life.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.154
You having fun there, Dan?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.989
Just breaking her in.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.592
Oh, it's time to
call Judy again.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.628
Well, you know,
it's been 15 minutes.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.168
Hi, Judy.
It's Mrs. Connor again.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.471
Listen, last time I called I
forgot to ask Becky something.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.073
Oh, she's in the
bathroom again, is she?

17:54.174 --> 17:55.142
Well, is she sick?

17:55.242 --> 17:58.145
Maybe we ought to drop
by and pick her up.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.181
Oh, OK.
I'll call back later then.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.482
Becky's sick?

18:02.582 --> 18:03.816
No, she's with Mark.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.951
What?

18:05.051 --> 18:06.619
What the hell is
she doing with Mark?

18:06.719 --> 18:07.954
We told her she
couldn't see him again.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.257
Well, that's how come she
lied and said she was at Judy's.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.125
I can't believe
you let her go.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.193
I had no choice.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.895
I had to let her go
so's I can catch her

18:15.995 --> 18:18.665
We just sit around here
while she's out with that punk?

18:18.765 --> 18:19.699
Don't worry.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.634
I call Judy every
15 minutes and then

18:21.734 --> 18:22.969
Judy calls Becky
wherever the hell

18:23.069 --> 18:25.238
she is and then Becky calls me.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.807
And the point of that is?

18:27.907 --> 18:31.711
To completely ruin
Becky's evening, see?

18:31.811 --> 18:34.847
And to make sure that,
you know, she's all right.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.249
[phone ringing]

18:37.817 --> 18:39.186
Hi, Becky.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.253
Yeah.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.623
Listen, you like pork
chops, don't you?

18:43.723 --> 18:44.991
OK, then.

18:45.091 --> 18:45.892
Bye.

18:49.128 --> 18:49.929
She's fine.

18:52.932 --> 18:53.733
Yeah.

18:53.833 --> 18:54.667
OK, Judy.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.369
Well, it's been
over half an hour.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.737
When you finally
do hear from her,

18:57.837 --> 18:59.071
you tell her to
get her butt home.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.273
She loves this
boy so much, fine.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.441
Let her move out
and live with him.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.942
All she's going to do
is lie to us anyway.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.246
Forget it, Judy.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.050
You're never leaving
this house again.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.286
What are you talking about?

19:13.386 --> 19:18.090
So, how was your evening?

19:18.191 --> 19:18.991
OK, I'm busted.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.627
You know I wasn't at Judy's.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.662
Oh?

19:22.762 --> 19:24.564
I was at Monica's.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.499
And I know how much
you guys hate her so I

19:26.599 --> 19:27.967
asked Judy to cover for me.

19:28.067 --> 19:28.868
That's one.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.537
Where were you?

19:30.637 --> 19:31.571
I told you I was at Monica's.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.209
OK, her parents weren't home.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.245
I knew you guys would be mad.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.147
- That's two.
- Two what?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.449
Two weeks grounded.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.417
You want to go for three,
or do we hear the word Mark?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.319
You lied to us, Becky,
and that is never,

19:46.419 --> 19:47.820
ever going to happen again.
Do you understand?

19:47.920 --> 19:48.888
Fine.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.290
And you're never
seeing Mark again, ever.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.190
All right.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.158
I mean it, Becky.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.660
I know.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.796
And you don't have to worry
because thanks to my mother,

19:56.896 --> 19:59.031
who made me call her
every 15 minutes,

19:59.131 --> 20:01.468
he's probably never going to
want to see me again anyway.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.970
Probably?

20:04.070 --> 20:05.538
And what if he probably does?

20:08.341 --> 20:10.377
I'm never going
to see him again.

20:10.477 --> 20:11.444
OK?

20:11.544 --> 20:13.613
Ever.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.615
You put your mom and me
through a lot of crap tonight.

20:19.018 --> 20:19.819
I'm sorry.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.756
Can I go now?
- Yeah.

20:23.856 --> 20:24.657
Get upstairs.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.799
You did good.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.167
I did, I did.

20:35.268 --> 20:38.438
You knew exactly where
she was going to be

20:38.538 --> 20:41.674
and you stayed one step
ahead of her all the time.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.710
Was there ever any doubt, Dan?

20:43.810 --> 20:44.611
I'm the best.

20:48.214 --> 20:51.083
Unfortunately,
next time I'm going

20:51.183 --> 20:52.419
to have to be even better.

21:12.839 --> 21:13.806
MARK: Come on, Mr. Connor.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.575
Let me out.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.643
