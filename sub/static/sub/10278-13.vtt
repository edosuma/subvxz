00:03.929 --> 00:06.307
E. R.

00:06.308 --> 00:07.881
Previously on E. R.

00:07.882 --> 00:10.875
I'll give you the Solu-Medrol
if you promise to use a walker.

00:10.876 --> 00:12.365
What? Are we negotiating?

00:12.366 --> 00:13.814
Do you want the steroids?

00:13.815 --> 00:14.893
I'll use a cane.

00:14.894 --> 00:17.762
- Right. Screw me!
- ...spineless, spiteful ass!

00:18.326 --> 00:19.913
- Are you done?
- No.

00:19.914 --> 00:22.751
You're in violation of our divorce
agreement. I am hiring a lawyer...

00:22.786 --> 00:24.518
...and I am getting my tuition money.

00:24.519 --> 00:26.291
- What's going on?
- With what?

00:26.292 --> 00:28.375
- With you and Carter.
- Nothing.

00:29.169 --> 00:31.168
- It seemed like you were fighting.
- We were.

00:31.369 --> 00:33.921
- Is Mark doing okay?
- Very well.

00:33.922 --> 00:37.741
- There's no change in personality or...?
- He's a little tired. Why?

00:37.742 --> 00:39.820
Have you noticed that
he's mixing his pronouns?

00:39.821 --> 00:43.181
- It's not a game! She blew his brains out!
- Who's "she"?

00:43.216 --> 00:44.915
- What?
- You said she.

00:44.916 --> 00:46.851
He! He's dead.

00:51.586 --> 00:52.748
Hey, Greg.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.794
Hey, Dr. Greene. Busy day?

00:54.964 --> 00:58.379
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.
Can we skip the gown? I got a shift.

00:58.550 --> 01:00.791
Oh, sure. Yeah. Let's go.

01:02.886 --> 01:05.756
E. R. 7x13 "THY WILL BE DONE"

01:11.059 --> 01:12.802
They say we're gonna hit
zero tonight.

01:12.977 --> 01:15.218
Even with the snow?

01:15.979 --> 01:18.849
Thought my heating bill
was bad last month.

01:20.775 --> 01:24.723
- Feel any side effects?
- Just the usual fatigue.

01:24.944 --> 01:28.229
Well, in eight days
this will all be a memory.

01:29.114 --> 01:30.940
Believe me, I've been counting.

01:31.699 --> 01:34.700
Okay, hold on, because we're off
by about a millimeter or so.

01:34.910 --> 01:38.409
Take your time. I don't want anything
to get zapped that doesn't have to be.

01:38.621 --> 01:42.155
There we go.
I'm gonna lock you in now.

01:47.253 --> 01:49.957
- Here we go. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:50.130 --> 01:53.249
- About three minutes.
- Right.

01:56.009 --> 01:57.966
- What do we got?
-58-year-old male.

01:58.136 --> 02:00.591
Collapsed at a birthday party.
Intubated in the field.

02:00.763 --> 02:01.794
That's a clown.

02:01.972 --> 02:04.641
He aspirated a balloon in front
of a dozen 6-year-olds.

02:04.808 --> 02:07.096
Good air entry. BP's 105/70.

02:07.268 --> 02:10.054
- Carter, will you help Abby with this?
- Why can't you do it?

02:10.228 --> 02:12.932
- I just can't.
- Dave, you afraid of clowns?

02:13.147 --> 02:15.519
Maybe he had a bad circus experience.
How long was he down?

02:15.691 --> 02:17.979
Three to five minutes.
Found him in respiratory arrest.

02:18.151 --> 02:21.353
Let's hook him up to a vent.
EKG, CBC, lytes, cardiac enzymes...

02:21.528 --> 02:24.315
- Dr. Carter, will you talk to this woman?
- And a chest film.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.280
I wanna check tube placement.
What's up?

02:26.449 --> 02:28.820
- I've got a dirty needle. I want a clean-
- We don't do that.

02:28.992 --> 02:31.068
- Like I said.
- A doctor here gave this to me.

02:31.244 --> 02:33.153
He said if I come back today,
I can have-

02:33.329 --> 02:34.704
There's a number you can call.

02:34.872 --> 02:37.576
- I just want a clean needle.
- I'm sorry. I cannot help you.

02:37.749 --> 02:41.164
- Dr. Carter?
- He said I wouldn't have to wait.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.825
Some girl called.
Said she can't make it tonight. Flu.

02:44.004 --> 02:46.043
Some girl? You didn't get her name?

02:46.214 --> 02:48.538
- You got more than one date tonight?
- Oh, great.

02:48.715 --> 02:50.423
- Big date?
- Had potential.

02:50.592 --> 02:52.335
So ask someone else.

02:52.510 --> 02:55.344
It's a charity event. It'll be boring.
Nobody'll want to go.

02:55.512 --> 02:57.136
- Ask someone in the ER.
- Like who?

02:57.305 --> 02:58.336
- I don't know.
- Chuny?

02:58.514 --> 03:00.590
- You wanna go?
- Not me. I've got plans.

03:00.766 --> 03:02.426
Don't even look at me.

03:02.601 --> 03:03.632
Dr. Carter?

03:03.810 --> 03:06.727
Hey, sorry about that.
I got pulled away there.

03:06.896 --> 03:08.687
You were gonna give me
something for-

03:08.855 --> 03:11.180
Mary, can you give Jeff
some viscous lidocaine?

03:11.357 --> 03:14.476
- They haven't taken my blood yet.
- No? Someone'll be in there.

03:14.651 --> 03:16.062
Think it's something serious?

03:16.236 --> 03:19.853
Probably not. But with two weeks of
fever, we should check out a few things.

03:20.031 --> 03:21.109
How we doing in here?

03:21.323 --> 03:23.814
Some spontaneous movement,
but he's still out.

03:23.992 --> 03:26.482
Glasgow Coma Scale is 1-1-4.

03:27.536 --> 03:29.030
So, what are you doing tonight?

03:29.788 --> 03:32.278
I've got an appointment
with my couch.

03:32.498 --> 03:34.241
Pulse ox, 98 on 50%.

03:34.416 --> 03:36.823
Well, I hate to come between
you and your couch...

03:37.002 --> 03:39.871
...but how does dinner and dancing
at the history museum sound?

03:40.129 --> 03:41.457
Dancing at the museum?

03:41.672 --> 03:44.423
- Pressure's down to 90/60.
- Run in 500 of saline.

03:44.591 --> 03:47.710
Yeah, it's a benefit for an
after-school program.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.336
Charity date.

03:50.553 --> 03:52.462
- How's the EKG coming?
- Almost done.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.175
Yeah, my grandparents host this
annual event, and I have to go.

03:57.350 --> 04:02.225
- But I would think of it as a favor...
- Do I owe you a favor?

04:03.021 --> 04:05.060
At the very least, it's a free meal.

04:05.231 --> 04:06.974
Tombstones on the anterior leads.

04:07.191 --> 04:09.313
Let's push 6000 of heparin.
Call the Cath Lab.

04:09.484 --> 04:11.725
- BP's only 70 systolic.
- Would you get Dr. Weaver?

04:11.903 --> 04:14.737
Start dopamine at 10 mics
per kilo per minute.

04:14.905 --> 04:17.574
Dr. Weaver! This clown is crashing.

04:18.449 --> 04:20.607
E. R.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:11.188 --> 05:13.346
So, what do you think about tonight?

05:13.523 --> 05:18.019
I think it's the least I could do. No one
should be alone after killing a clown.

05:18.194 --> 05:19.357
- You killed the clown?
- No.

05:19.530 --> 05:21.605
Didn't save him.

05:22.115 --> 05:23.443
Enough flu on the board?

05:23.616 --> 05:24.861
'Tis the season.

05:25.035 --> 05:27.359
- Guy in Curtain 3 fell off a ladder.
- Yeah? How far?

05:27.537 --> 05:29.908
Taking down Christmas lights.
Fell from the top rung.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.702
- That's what you get for procrastinating.
- I'll take it.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.544
- There he is. This is my doctor.
- Hi, Janice.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.877
- They wouldn't give me a needle.
- Haleh, give her a clean one.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.755
- You serious?
- We I&D'd the abscess...

05:40.924 --> 05:42.964
- ... on her forearm yesterday.
- I got that.

05:43.135 --> 05:46.585
- This'll keep it from happening again.
- Thank you, Dr. Greene.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.556
- Come back tomorrow for a wound check.
- I'll try.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.681
- You're not gonna fill out a chart?
- Nope.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.342
- No prescription?
- Waste of time.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.808
I can get behind that.

05:57.189 --> 06:00.605
Excuse me. I'm looking for Dr. Kovac.

06:00.776 --> 06:03.812
- I know you. You're the bishop, right?
- Right.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.896
Where's that hat you were wearing?

06:06.073 --> 06:08.693
- I left that one at home today.
- I really liked it.

06:08.866 --> 06:10.741
- Me too.
- There he is.

06:10.910 --> 06:14.279
- Hello again.
- Bishop, are you all right?

06:14.455 --> 06:18.535
Oh, yeah. Sure. I was just finishing up
my visitations. Do you have a moment?

06:18.709 --> 06:20.667
I don't see a cane.

06:20.837 --> 06:22.461
No, you don't.

06:22.630 --> 06:24.207
Have any more pain?

06:24.381 --> 06:25.412
Not from the fall.

06:25.591 --> 06:27.382
Your arthritis is still a problem?

06:27.551 --> 06:31.086
I was wondering if I could get another
prescription for some prednisone.

06:31.263 --> 06:34.014
- Did you follow up with your doctor?
- No, I keep having to...

06:34.182 --> 06:35.557
...change the appointment.

06:35.725 --> 06:38.216
- That should be the priority.
- I know. Unfortunately...

06:38.394 --> 06:39.853
...he doesn't work on Saturdays.

06:40.021 --> 06:42.477
- What's his name?
- Don Frost at St. Mary's.

06:42.649 --> 06:44.854
- I should call him.
- You'll only get his service.

06:45.025 --> 06:47.730
And frankly, just between us,
I'd rather not get him going.

06:47.904 --> 06:51.106
I so much as sneeze, and he wants to
poke and prod every inch of me.

06:51.281 --> 06:54.116
I'd have to do some tests before
prescribing anything more.

06:54.284 --> 06:56.276
What kind of tests?

06:56.453 --> 06:59.370
Blood, urine,
check your sugar level.

06:59.539 --> 07:04.118
My sugar's a little high. I have a touch
of diabetes. But I control it with diet.

07:04.294 --> 07:06.286
Okay. Let's take a look.

07:08.172 --> 07:09.916
Looks good.

07:10.091 --> 07:11.335
Strep throat, right?

07:11.509 --> 07:16.647
- No fever, no swollen glands.
- I had the exact thing last year. Strep.

07:17.889 --> 07:19.632
You have a cold, Mr. Ramirez.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.350
Antibiotics, 10 days. Right?

07:21.893 --> 07:24.810
No white spots on your tonsils.
Antibiotics won't help.

07:24.979 --> 07:28.348
- Last year they cleared it right up.
- Would have cleared up anyway.

07:28.608 --> 07:30.516
Come on.
I've been waiting three hours.

07:30.734 --> 07:34.186
- Plenty of fluids and get some rest.
- Can you just give me the prescription?

07:34.363 --> 07:37.150
- Dr. Greene, we need you.
- You don't have strep throat.

07:37.325 --> 07:38.818
I'll take them just in case.

07:40.077 --> 07:42.318
85-year-old woman,
collapsed at a nursing home.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.776
- You got a pulse?
- No.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.033
Found her in V-fib. Intubated, shocked
five times, two rounds of drugs.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.658
- How long you been at it?
-20 minutes.

07:49.836 --> 07:55.589
Okay, everybody, nice and easy.
On my count. One, two, three...

07:55.841 --> 07:57.004
Any medical history?

07:57.176 --> 08:00.759
- Emphysema. She's on home oxygen.
- Asystole on the monitor.

08:00.930 --> 08:03.218
- When was the last epi?
- Five minutes ago.

08:03.682 --> 08:05.474
Push another amp.

08:06.018 --> 08:07.926
- What?
- She didn't respond...

08:08.103 --> 08:11.388
...to 20 minutes of ACLS in the field.
She doesn't have a chance.

08:11.606 --> 08:15.651
- The family wanted us to bring her in.
- So we could flog her for another hour?

08:16.152 --> 08:17.646
- You want dopamine?
- Nope.

08:19.029 --> 08:20.227
I'm sorry, Dr. Greene.

08:20.447 --> 08:23.069
She should have died
in her own bed.

08:23.284 --> 08:24.659
Abby, hold compressions.

08:27.037 --> 08:31.663
- Asystole.
- Time of death, 1409.

08:32.376 --> 08:34.783
Family's in Chairs.

08:37.337 --> 08:38.453
Don't worry about it.

08:41.509 --> 08:42.623
Hey.

08:42.801 --> 08:43.832
Hey.

08:44.010 --> 08:47.214
- Everything okay?
- We just lost a patient.

08:47.389 --> 08:52.015
Sorry. That singer you like
is playing at the hotel tonight.

08:52.185 --> 08:55.222
- Really?
-10:00.

08:56.148 --> 08:58.472
I told Carter I'd go somewhere
with him tonight.

08:58.649 --> 09:01.853
- Okay.
- Fundraiser. His date stood him up.

09:03.112 --> 09:05.983
It's not a problem. I have
a pile of journals to read.

09:06.741 --> 09:08.816
I'm sorry. I wouldn't
have said yes if I knew-

09:09.034 --> 09:12.320
Labs are back on the bishop.
Blood sugar's high.

09:12.996 --> 09:14.870
- Go. Have fun.
- Okay.

09:19.085 --> 09:21.837
- Draw five units.
- Take a look at his ANA.

09:22.923 --> 09:24.879
Do you have his BUN
and creatinine?

09:25.049 --> 09:27.457
Renal insufficiency.

09:30.346 --> 09:32.338
Hey, Jeff.

09:32.932 --> 09:34.011
You okay?

09:34.850 --> 09:39.311
- Just nervous.
- Sit. I got your blood test back.

09:39.688 --> 09:42.143
Okay. The bad news is
you have mononucleosis.

09:42.315 --> 09:45.352
Good news is, if you rest up,
you'll bounce back in a couple weeks.

09:45.527 --> 09:48.017
- Mono.
- Yeah. But you'll be all right.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.438
How is my blood count?

09:50.698 --> 09:54.363
White cells were a little elevated,
but that's consistent with mono.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.119
What about my CD4 count?

09:57.538 --> 10:02.449
Are you HIV-positive?
Because we only do that if you are.

10:02.709 --> 10:04.251
I think I need an HIV test.

10:05.211 --> 10:07.288
Have you ever been tested before?

10:07.798 --> 10:09.873
- Five months ago I was negative.
- That's good.

10:10.049 --> 10:13.216
- But since then I've been exposed.
- You've had unprotected sex?

10:13.928 --> 10:15.303
With an infected partner.

10:17.557 --> 10:18.967
You know how unsafe that is?

10:20.601 --> 10:22.261
I guess I just get caught up.

10:24.772 --> 10:26.645
Gotta put a stop to that, Jeff.

10:39.119 --> 10:40.399
My sugar that bad?

10:41.495 --> 10:44.116
Three hundred forty-eight.

10:44.582 --> 10:48.958
- Maybe I'll go back on the glipizide.
- Right now you need insulin.

10:49.127 --> 10:55.015
There was also protein in your urine.
So I ordered an ANA.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.135
That's a test for a disease
called lupus.

10:58.845 --> 11:00.802
I know.

11:01.014 --> 11:06.138
I take Plaquenil,
200 milligrams a day.

11:06.936 --> 11:10.803
- You lied to me?
- I wanted to avoid a debate.

11:11.023 --> 11:13.692
I may have harmed you
by giving you those steroids.

11:13.859 --> 11:17.773
The steroids help me.
I can move around, make visits...

11:17.988 --> 11:22.115
...do my work.
Without them, I'm stuck in bed.

11:23.035 --> 11:25.359
The steroids raise
your blood sugar so high...

11:25.536 --> 11:27.943
...that the diabetes
destroys your body.

11:29.707 --> 11:33.324
I need to continue my ministry.

11:34.086 --> 11:35.367
You understand?

11:39.717 --> 11:42.421
Anyway, thank you for your time.

11:42.594 --> 11:45.050
I need to do
a complete physical exam.

11:45.222 --> 11:47.510
No, I'm sorry. I've got a lot
on my plate today.

11:47.682 --> 11:51.181
I have to make sure I didn't
harm you with my treatment.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.559
You owe me that much.

11:55.064 --> 11:57.637
And what is it you think I owe you?

12:01.069 --> 12:05.565
Bishop, lupus is very serious.

12:05.740 --> 12:08.860
It can attack your kidneys,
lungs, your heart.

12:09.035 --> 12:11.027
I know what it does, Dr. Kovac.

12:16.584 --> 12:19.454
I even know I'm gonna die from it.

12:26.051 --> 12:27.545
Did I wake you?

12:27.719 --> 12:31.551
No, I was just resting my eyes.
So how's the heart?

12:31.723 --> 12:35.507
- EKG looks good.
- That's what we like to hear.

12:35.977 --> 12:37.850
Want me to call someone
to be with you?

12:38.020 --> 12:42.232
No. I called the archdiocese
just in case.

12:43.734 --> 12:47.601
- What church do you belong to?
- I don't.

12:47.780 --> 12:50.566
- Haven't found one you liked?
- Haven't looked.

12:50.908 --> 12:54.821
- How long have you been in Chicago?
- I don't go to church anymore.

12:55.119 --> 12:57.409
Really? Why's that?

12:58.581 --> 12:59.779
I don't remember.

13:01.417 --> 13:03.991
- You married?
- No.

13:05.004 --> 13:07.079
Haven't found one you liked?

13:07.423 --> 13:09.047
Something like that, yeah.

13:09.258 --> 13:12.258
Dr. Kovac, we've got a kid
with bad congestive heart failure.

13:12.928 --> 13:15.217
The nurse will be in.

13:17.432 --> 13:18.843
- What's the pulse ox?
-81.

13:19.017 --> 13:21.306
16-year-old.
Collapsed at a basketball game.

13:21.478 --> 13:23.553
- Watching or playing?
- Watching.

13:23.729 --> 13:25.189
- What's his name?
- Nick.

13:25.398 --> 13:27.189
Hi, Nick. I'm Dr. Kovac.

13:28.442 --> 13:31.064
- Have you had heart surgery, Nick?
- Transplant.

13:31.237 --> 13:33.312
- How long ago?
- Six years.

13:33.489 --> 13:35.446
- Someone call his parents.
- On their way.

13:35.658 --> 13:37.317
BP, 115/72.

13:37.701 --> 13:40.322
Lungs are full of fluid.
He's in pulmonary edema.

13:40.496 --> 13:44.362
- Sublingual nitroglycerin and start a drip.
- Open your mouth, Nick. This'll help.

13:44.582 --> 13:45.958
Titrate up to 10 of morphine.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.375
I need a 12-lead, blood gas,
portable chest and 40 of Lasix.

13:49.754 --> 13:52.625
- Pulse ox down to 78.
- Notify the transplant team.

13:52.799 --> 13:53.996
And order a PICU bed.

13:54.383 --> 13:56.459
They want to give me a new heart?

13:56.677 --> 13:58.053
Yes.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.759
I don't want another transplant.

14:04.226 --> 14:06.017
Malucci, what do you got
in Exam Four?

14:06.186 --> 14:08.724
Lady with bronchitis.
Sending her out with amoxicillin.

14:08.897 --> 14:12.146
- Bronchitis?
- Cough, myalgias, arthralgias.

14:12.316 --> 14:14.393
- Sounds like the flu.
- She's high-maintenance.

14:14.569 --> 14:17.024
- Wants antibiotics.
- Antibiotics are not indicated.

14:17.196 --> 14:18.939
I told her that.
She still wants them.

14:19.115 --> 14:21.819
You need to educate her
about antibiotic resistance.

14:21.992 --> 14:23.984
- Do I have to?
- Gotta break the cycle.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.996
- It's easier to write a prescription.
- If you feed the bears...

14:27.164 --> 14:28.622
...they'll come back for more.

14:28.790 --> 14:30.913
Food poisoning gets
another liter of saline.

14:31.084 --> 14:33.242
Check a post-reduction
shoulder on this one.

14:33.419 --> 14:36.255
This is a patient who's
waiting on an HIV test.

14:36.423 --> 14:37.620
Okay. Malucci can take it.

14:37.799 --> 14:39.838
This last one's delicate. He's high-risk.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.002
- Malucci can be delicate.
- Thank you, chief.

14:42.220 --> 14:44.093
No, really-

14:44.263 --> 14:46.719
Dave, this one's gonna
require some tact.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.510
You got it.

14:50.810 --> 14:54.345
He's a patient with mono,
he's gay, refuses to use condoms.

14:54.523 --> 14:56.930
Think you can talk to him?
Without being insensitive?

14:57.150 --> 15:00.151
Sure. I'll wrap it all up
in a nice big bow.

15:04.532 --> 15:07.698
Carter, a construction worker had
a pane of glass dropped on him.

15:07.868 --> 15:11.367
- Could you help with the suturing?
- Actually, I'm off. I gotta get going.

15:11.705 --> 15:13.448
- Oh, yeah. The fundraising.
- Yeah.

15:13.665 --> 15:17.283
It's more like a family obligation.
It's nothing really exciting.

15:18.336 --> 15:21.124
- What's the charity?
- After-school enrichment programs.

15:21.423 --> 15:22.537
Enrichment?

15:22.715 --> 15:27.424
Yeah. It's, you know, extra education.
Arts, music, that kind of thing.

15:27.595 --> 15:30.715
Actually, Abby's saving me from
getting heat from my grandparents.

15:30.890 --> 15:34.673
- They kind of insist I bring somebody.
- I hope it's successful.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.563
- Thank you.
- See you.

15:40.607 --> 15:44.391
Hey, Jeff. I'm Dr. Malucci.
Dr. Carter went off duty.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.645
You... You have his lab results?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.782
I'd like to talk to Jeff about that.
Would you excuse us?

15:50.199 --> 15:53.900
Actually, I'd like to stay.
I'm Sean, Jeff's partner.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.613
- Is that okay with you, Jeff?
- Yeah.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.454
Well, it's all good, man. Your HIV
antibody test came back negative.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.459
- Really?
- Yeah. You got lucky.

16:03.671 --> 16:08.213
But now you need to avoid risky
behavior and keep yourself healthy.

16:08.633 --> 16:10.128
Yeah.

16:10.927 --> 16:13.168
Am I missing something here, guys?

16:13.888 --> 16:15.466
I'm HIV-positive.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.390
Jeff and I are together.

16:22.396 --> 16:24.803
- Through everything.
- Right.

16:25.733 --> 16:29.315
So, what?
Are you trying to contract HIV?

16:31.613 --> 16:34.151
- You a bug-chaser, Jeff?
- We don't call it that.

16:34.365 --> 16:35.989
Then what do you call it? Suicide?

16:36.200 --> 16:39.901
- HIV is treatable with medication.
- Doesn't mean you should try to catch it.

16:40.121 --> 16:44.284
Look, we both know that his
HIV antibody could be negative...

16:44.458 --> 16:46.581
...for six weeks after exposure.

16:46.752 --> 16:50.500
So you can't really tell us
that he's definitely negative, can you?

16:53.550 --> 16:57.084
No. We'd have to take a
direct measure of his viral load.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.844
Okay. Let's do that.

17:00.890 --> 17:02.384
That's gonna take some time.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.183
- We'll wait.
- Yeah, we'll wait.

17:09.021 --> 17:10.054
Okay.

17:11.233 --> 17:14.352
Flat T-waves in the lateral leads.

17:15.069 --> 17:18.189
Okay. Repeat 12-lead in an hour.

17:18.823 --> 17:20.650
Something wrong?

17:20.826 --> 17:24.739
You have some
non-specific EKG changes.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.204
And there is a friction rub
around your heart.

17:32.253 --> 17:34.411
I'm creaky all over.

17:34.588 --> 17:36.082
Have you had chest pain?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.830
- Occasionally. I'm used to it.
- How about today?

17:39.009 --> 17:41.167
- This morning.
- For how long?

17:41.344 --> 17:44.014
I don't know, half an hour?

17:45.390 --> 17:50.514
You may have fluid around the heart.
You could be at risk for a heart attack.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.145
I feel fine.

17:52.313 --> 17:55.314
We need to get a cardiac echo
and admit you.

17:55.483 --> 17:56.858
No.

17:57.026 --> 17:59.183
I have to observe you
for at least six hours.

17:59.362 --> 18:01.603
I'll stay, but I don't want
to be checked in.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.235
I'd rather observe you
in the Cardiac Unit.

18:04.449 --> 18:06.157
I don't want my life
to end in a hospital.

18:06.368 --> 18:09.866
- You're not gonna die today.
- I will not be admitted!

18:12.498 --> 18:14.538
- Are you Nick's doctor?
- Yes, Dr. Kovac.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.618
There's no doctor with him,
just a nurse.

18:16.794 --> 18:20.328
- Well, Nick is stable right now.
- He was in heart failure?

18:20.714 --> 18:24.498
Yes. He's responding to aggressive
therapy. He has pulmonary edema.

18:24.676 --> 18:27.168
The same thing happened
after his second transplant.

18:27.346 --> 18:28.721
He's had two?

18:28.889 --> 18:31.462
One when he was 4,
then again when he was 10.

18:31.641 --> 18:33.848
And now he's on the list for a third.

18:34.019 --> 18:36.723
They did angioplasty last year,
but he's still so weak.

18:36.937 --> 18:39.559
Has Nick ever told you
he doesn't want a new heart?

18:40.691 --> 18:44.226
He says that when he's depressed.
He takes 15 medications a day.

18:44.403 --> 18:48.447
- He's still so sick.
- A lot for a 16-year-old to go through.

18:48.615 --> 18:51.153
Can you call UNOS?
He should go to a higher status.

18:51.910 --> 18:54.697
I was waiting to talk to you
to see if that's what you wanted.

18:55.122 --> 18:57.197
Of course we do.

18:57.874 --> 18:59.118
Okay.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.540
My flu patient wants to see
someone higher up.

19:01.711 --> 19:03.750
- What's the problem?
- She wants antibiotics...

19:03.921 --> 19:07.124
...gets them every year, refuses
to leave till she gets a prescription.

19:07.300 --> 19:10.918
- Where is she?
- Right there. Curtain 1.

19:13.055 --> 19:15.011
Hello. My name's Dr. Greene.

19:15.181 --> 19:18.136
Sara Dell. I've been sick
for three days.

19:18.351 --> 19:21.352
Fever, runny nose...
Feel like my head's in a vise.

19:21.562 --> 19:24.682
Mrs. Dell, antibiotics
don't help the flu.

19:25.108 --> 19:28.358
- They always help mine.
- I can assure you they don't.

19:28.736 --> 19:31.108
You're not giving them to
me because I'm poor.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.823
If we give antibiotics to millions
of people who don't need them...

19:34.992 --> 19:37.992
...a resistance builds which eventually
makes the drugs useless...

19:38.161 --> 19:39.537
...to the people who do.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.663
And because I don't have insurance.
That's persecution!

19:42.874 --> 19:44.333
- You think so?
- I know so!

19:44.501 --> 19:46.991
- You know what? Follow me.
- Well, where are we going?

19:47.170 --> 19:49.839
Come on, follow me. Pay attention.

19:51.674 --> 19:53.797
Excuse me!

19:54.676 --> 19:58.425
My name is Dr. Greene. I'd
like to see a show of hands...

19:58.639 --> 20:00.596
...of people who have a sore throat.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.131
- Right here.
- Yeah, man.

20:02.351 --> 20:03.595
Cough?

20:04.728 --> 20:06.306
Muscle aches, fever?

20:08.273 --> 20:10.230
You all have the flu.

20:10.399 --> 20:14.183
People who have the flu will not be
receiving antibiotics today.

20:14.403 --> 20:17.819
So consider that while you decide
whether you want to wait or not.

20:19.116 --> 20:20.990
- What are you doing?
- Clearing the board.

20:21.159 --> 20:25.656
- Isn't that an EMT ALA violation?
- I didn't discharge anyone.

20:27.457 --> 20:31.075
Hey, Greene. Tell me you are not
giving free needles to junkies.

20:31.252 --> 20:34.170
- On a case-by-case basis.
- No, no, no. On no basis. It's illegal.

20:34.339 --> 20:36.876
Not if there's a public-health
emergency, which there is.

20:37.550 --> 20:39.342
How much of your brain
did they cut out?

20:39.552 --> 20:41.710
This does not put extra
needles on the street.

20:41.929 --> 20:45.263
I don't care! We are not gonna have
junkies parading in and out of here!

20:45.433 --> 20:48.184
So you're not interested in
cutting back on HIV and...?

20:48.477 --> 20:52.142
- And? What? Sounds like?
- Hep...

20:52.564 --> 20:54.058
- Hep?
- Hep-

20:54.274 --> 20:56.765
Hep? Heparin, heptathlon?

20:56.943 --> 20:58.734
- Hepatitis.
- Tough one.

20:59.487 --> 21:03.022
You want to start a needle exchange,
do it from your house.

21:25.219 --> 21:27.591
- Hi.
- You're wearing a tuxedo.

21:27.763 --> 21:30.005
- You didn't say it was formal.
- I didn't?

21:30.183 --> 21:31.213
No.

21:32.518 --> 21:35.223
- Yeah, it's formal.
- You tricked me.

21:35.604 --> 21:39.851
- Doesn't matter. You look terrific.
- Well, we don't match, though.

21:40.025 --> 21:43.939
- I can go change.
- I don't even know if I own a dress.

21:44.237 --> 21:46.396
Wanna go buy one?

21:46.948 --> 21:50.862
No. Can you just-?
Just wait one minute.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.746
- You mad at me?
- Yes.

21:55.372 --> 21:58.243
- Did you get a haircut?
- Yeah.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.868
Who are my parents talking to?

22:01.044 --> 22:04.709
Dr. Corday. She's a surgeon.

22:05.048 --> 22:07.539
I told you I didn't want surgery.

22:07.718 --> 22:10.884
You were in a lot of pain
when you said that.

22:11.262 --> 22:13.588
I still meant it.

22:13.765 --> 22:17.382
You won't survive
without the transplant.

22:18.394 --> 22:21.597
I was hoping to make it
to my prom.

22:21.772 --> 22:25.106
But if I can't, I can't.

22:25.275 --> 22:28.229
With a new heart, you will.

22:28.861 --> 22:32.480
Do you know what it's like
to have your chest split open?

22:32.657 --> 22:33.985
No.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.236
I can barely walk to class,
I get so tired.

22:38.037 --> 22:41.074
I take pills every two hours.

22:41.249 --> 22:46.076
And I look like a freak from
the side effects. It's not worth it.

22:49.297 --> 22:51.540
- He's at the top of the list?
- Yes. Status 1-A.

22:51.717 --> 22:54.503
It's just a matter of waiting for
a heart with a tissue match.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.836
We waited a month
on Status 1-A last time.

22:57.014 --> 22:59.338
Now that he's older,
there are more possibilities.

22:59.515 --> 23:04.261
Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Stevens,
but Nick doesn't want a new heart.

23:04.437 --> 23:05.931
We explained that to you.

23:06.105 --> 23:08.228
He's thought it out.
He has good reasons.

23:08.399 --> 23:10.687
- I think you should listen to them.
- He's 16.

23:10.901 --> 23:12.727
And he is tired of living like this.

23:12.902 --> 23:15.145
Well, I'm not giving up on him
because he's tired.

23:15.364 --> 23:17.771
I'm only telling you
what Nick told me.

23:17.949 --> 23:20.025
I understand.
When do we move him to the unit?

23:21.119 --> 23:22.364
Shouldn't be too long.

23:25.040 --> 23:29.036
Kerry, we have a little personnel
problem. Well, you do. Mark Greene.

23:29.209 --> 23:30.918
He's walking around with attitude...

23:31.087 --> 23:33.375
...handing out needles,
blanking out on words.

23:33.547 --> 23:35.587
It's swelling from the
chemotherapy wafers.

23:35.758 --> 23:38.592
- Really.
- He has a mild expressive aphasia.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.302
- It's temporary.
- I don't like it.

23:40.470 --> 23:42.013
I don't think he likes it either.

23:42.180 --> 23:45.299
Noticed any personality changes?
He got very confrontational with me.

23:45.474 --> 23:47.930
- You're used to confrontation.
- We're not talking about me.

23:48.102 --> 23:51.186
- Isn't that your favorite subject?
- Just straighten him out.

23:51.397 --> 23:55.690
- Who's this with you at the beach?
- Eric, my brother.

24:00.656 --> 24:06.278
I never got the whole concept behind
dried flowers. I mean, they're dead.

24:06.453 --> 24:10.153
- They're dead as soon as you cut them.
- Yeah, but they look nice.

24:10.331 --> 24:12.786
Dead ones look nice too.

24:13.542 --> 24:17.042
Right. Right, no. I was just wondering.

24:17.213 --> 24:19.834
- Wondering what?
- Wondering...

24:20.007 --> 24:23.589
Why not just buy the fresh flowers?

24:23.760 --> 24:27.212
Because there's something
sad and dark about the dried ones.

24:27.389 --> 24:31.054
- Oh, yeah? You like sad and dark?
- Yeah.

24:33.478 --> 24:34.592
Okay.

24:35.062 --> 24:37.732
Just give those a couple days.

24:38.441 --> 24:40.563
You found something.
That looks nice.

24:40.734 --> 24:42.015
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

24:42.612 --> 24:44.853
It works on you.

24:45.030 --> 24:46.275
- You're lying.
- No, honestly.

24:46.448 --> 24:49.698
I don't think anybody would know that.
Looks like it was made for you.

24:49.868 --> 24:52.538
Okay. Now I know you're lying.
Let's just go.

24:55.874 --> 24:58.282
- Carter. What is this?
- What?

24:58.460 --> 25:00.831
Come on.
What do you want to take, the El?

25:01.003 --> 25:04.040
You're not gonna tell me,
"By the way, this party's in Paris"?

25:04.215 --> 25:06.540
No. We stay in Chicago, I promise.

25:06.759 --> 25:12.049
He needs bandages, update his tetanus
and order a six-pack of Keflex.

25:14.516 --> 25:17.967
- You lost your cap.
- I decided to wear my scar with pride.

25:18.144 --> 25:20.766
- It adds character.
- Well, it scared a little kid.

25:20.939 --> 25:22.397
Called me Humpty Dumpty.

25:22.565 --> 25:26.563
Well, Humpty, how do you feel
about an evening service?

25:26.736 --> 25:28.444
- What service?
- The wedding.

25:28.612 --> 25:32.692
Coordinator double-booked the afternoon,
and they want to push us back to 5:00.

25:32.867 --> 25:35.274
- That would push the reception back.
- Yes.

25:35.452 --> 25:38.157
I've already spoken with the
caterer. He says he can do it.

25:38.330 --> 25:41.746
- But we can't use the patio for cocktails.
- What's wrong with the patio?

25:41.917 --> 25:44.372
April, the evening,
it'd be really chilly.

25:44.544 --> 25:49.419
Well, ask him to move out the,
you know...

25:50.883 --> 25:53.457
Space heaters.

25:53.636 --> 25:56.257
- So it's all right with you?
- Yeah, sure.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.263
Okay, then.

26:04.438 --> 26:09.432
Mark, you're getting better.
The aphasia's fading.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.648
I'm glad you think so.

26:12.111 --> 26:15.148
No, it is. In a couple of weeks,
this will all be gone.

26:15.573 --> 26:18.146
I don't think I can count on you
for an unbiased opinion.

26:18.617 --> 26:21.535
No, you can't. I am biased.
I'm also right.

26:21.704 --> 26:24.028
Dr. Corday?
Nick Stevens just arrested.

26:24.206 --> 26:26.365
- Whose patient? I'll grab him.
- Kovac.

26:26.583 --> 26:27.958
- Oh, God!
- What's the rhythm?

26:28.126 --> 26:29.454
Still V-tach.

26:29.627 --> 26:31.667
- Charge to 300.
- Come on, Nick!

26:31.838 --> 26:34.543
Excuse me, sir.
You'll have to stand back.

26:34.716 --> 26:36.044
Okay, I need to intubate.

26:36.217 --> 26:38.589
100 of lidocaine.
Stand by with amiodarone.

26:38.761 --> 26:41.216
- Charged and ready. Clear!
- Clear.

26:41.388 --> 26:43.298
- Still no change.
- Please save him.

26:43.474 --> 26:44.968
360.

26:45.184 --> 26:48.055
I need some cricoid pressure.
I'm in.

26:48.938 --> 26:51.510
- Rebolus 50 of lidocaine in five.
- Clear!

26:51.690 --> 26:53.482
Clear.

26:55.068 --> 26:56.313
Got a rhythm.

26:56.486 --> 26:59.487
- There's a weak radial pulse.
- Mix up the dobutamine.

26:59.656 --> 27:00.854
Open your eyes, Nick.

27:02.116 --> 27:03.693
Come on, Nick. Wake up for me.

27:03.909 --> 27:07.361
- Good breath sounds bilaterally.
- Unresponsive to painful stimulation.

27:07.705 --> 27:10.492
He wasn't down long.
He should wake up.

27:13.001 --> 27:14.246
Maybe.

27:25.054 --> 27:28.921
- Three separate light settings.
- That's an essential amenity.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.393
- So I talked to Luka.
- Me too.

27:34.563 --> 27:39.557
- He didn't seem to mind about tonight.
- No. He doesn't get jealous.

27:39.735 --> 27:41.857
Ever.

27:52.997 --> 27:55.784
All the years I've lived here,
I've never been to the...

27:55.958 --> 27:58.531
Natural History Museum?
That's criminal.

27:58.710 --> 28:02.542
- They've got dinosaurs, cavemen.
- Dinosaurs and dancing?

28:02.714 --> 28:06.842
Yeah. My grandparents
like spectacle.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.717
It's not gonna be that big
of a deal, though. A few people.

28:19.104 --> 28:21.394
- You are so dead.
- It's kind of a scene.

28:21.566 --> 28:24.234
- Kind of?
- I told you. They like spectacle.

28:24.401 --> 28:26.559
Did you grow up going to
these kinds of things?

28:26.736 --> 28:30.236
This is par for the course. If you
hate it, we can leave in a half-hour.

28:30.407 --> 28:31.569
I won't hate it.

28:31.741 --> 28:34.742
- Can we duck the photographer?
- Can we?

28:41.125 --> 28:44.375
Hey, Jeff. Where's Sean?

28:44.545 --> 28:46.253
He went to move the car.

28:46.422 --> 28:48.913
I don't want to wait
to tell you the news.

28:49.091 --> 28:52.257
Your viral test is back.
No virus detected.

28:52.761 --> 28:56.593
- So I'm really HIV-negative.
- Definitely negative.

29:00.227 --> 29:02.135
You and...

29:02.937 --> 29:06.436
- You and Sean are close?
- Been together almost a year.

29:06.607 --> 29:08.979
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

29:09.151 --> 29:12.816
- But nothing's worth dying for, is it?
- I'm not dying.

29:13.655 --> 29:16.692
No. You're safe right now.
But you have to protect yourself.

29:16.950 --> 29:20.116
- I'm gonna get it sooner or later.
- Not if you practice safe sex.

29:21.162 --> 29:23.404
I don't want to treat him
like he's contaminated.

29:23.581 --> 29:26.831
- With a condom, that's how he feels.
- HIV can kill you, Jeff.

29:27.042 --> 29:29.747
- I know a lot of people living with it.
- A lot of people...

29:29.920 --> 29:32.078
...would rather
be living without it.

29:32.631 --> 29:35.087
Look.

29:35.259 --> 29:37.963
- How old are you, man?
-23.

29:38.136 --> 29:41.054
Because you got
50, 60 years ahead of you.

29:43.141 --> 29:44.470
I love him.

29:45.143 --> 29:48.143
Well, if he loves you, he should
want you to stay healthy.

29:48.312 --> 29:51.812
He thinks that this is the only way
that we can really be intimate.

29:51.983 --> 29:55.434
That's easy for him to say.
He's got the virus.

29:55.611 --> 29:58.647
I don't have anybody else.

30:00.323 --> 30:02.530
You have yourself.

30:10.124 --> 30:12.283
- Those are the bouncers. I know them.
- Oh, yeah?

30:12.460 --> 30:15.793
- Bark is much worse than their bite.
- I see how they keep people in line.

30:15.963 --> 30:17.707
- John, there you are.
- Hi, Grandpa.

30:17.882 --> 30:21.380
- Finally! Someone I wanted to talk to.
- Not so loud.

30:21.551 --> 30:24.339
- Is this your friend from the auction?
- No. She had the flu.

30:24.763 --> 30:26.554
- And you are?
- Abby Lockhart.

30:26.723 --> 30:28.182
Jonathan Truman Carter Sr.

30:29.017 --> 30:31.804
Delighted. We don't get to see
too many of Johnny's friends.

30:31.978 --> 30:33.223
You got lucky tonight.

30:33.396 --> 30:36.516
You're very good to get dressed up
and come out on such a cold night.

30:36.732 --> 30:39.687
I'd much rather stay at home
in a bathrobe.

30:39.861 --> 30:43.027
- Don't let Gamma hear you say that.
- Oh, she knows me by now.

30:43.238 --> 30:45.030
- I'd love to meet her.
- Where is she?

30:45.241 --> 30:48.075
Talking to the keynote speaker.
Go on.

30:48.243 --> 30:49.903
- Shall we?
- Nice to meet you.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.947
Have a good time.

30:52.372 --> 30:53.866
Friend from the auction?

30:54.040 --> 30:58.334
Last family event I was at,
the daughter of the host, she...

30:59.295 --> 31:00.872
- Never mind.
- No, come on. Tell me.

31:01.047 --> 31:03.372
You ever take dance classes?

31:03.549 --> 31:07.499
- No. Have you?
- Yeah. Actually, I have a few moves.

31:07.678 --> 31:09.587
I'm sure you do.

31:09.763 --> 31:11.802
Care to give it a whirl?

31:12.183 --> 31:15.136
- I don't know.
- Come on. Just follow me.

31:15.310 --> 31:18.430
- I'm not sure that I can.
- I got you.

31:28.072 --> 31:32.069
I feel like I'm back at my
spring formal in high school.

31:33.577 --> 31:38.369
I went with this guy Seth.
But I had a crush on this guy Tim.

31:38.540 --> 31:41.411
- I'm feeling for Seth.
- When he went to the bathroom...

31:41.585 --> 31:45.084
...Tim asked me if I wanted to
go outside and smoke a cigarette.

31:45.255 --> 31:48.754
And we never went back inside.

31:48.925 --> 31:50.418
- That's cruel.
- I know.

31:51.803 --> 31:54.044
Is that when you started smoking?

31:54.221 --> 31:56.298
I guess so.

31:56.974 --> 31:59.927
See, it's all Tim Stillman's fault.

32:04.272 --> 32:06.181
Right.

32:16.283 --> 32:18.609
I didn't forget you.

32:20.287 --> 32:24.665
Your CPK's normal.

32:24.833 --> 32:28.616
- I watched you work on that boy.
- Yeah.

32:29.671 --> 32:32.422
You'll be going for your echo soon.

32:32.799 --> 32:36.298
It was remarkable.
You brought him back to life.

32:36.469 --> 32:38.011
Yes.

32:38.804 --> 32:41.212
It won't do much good
if he doesn't have the surgery.

32:41.682 --> 32:44.552
- You can't find him a heart?
- He doesn't want one.

32:44.976 --> 32:49.473
But he's so young. There are
bound to be medical advancements.

32:49.648 --> 32:51.308
He's gotta fight.

32:51.483 --> 32:53.689
One could say
the same to you, bishop.

32:55.737 --> 32:58.109
- I am fighting.
- Are you?

32:58.281 --> 33:02.907
You say you should prolong his life,
but you want to hasten your death?

33:04.203 --> 33:07.073
I'm not looking forward
to dying, Dr. Kovac.

33:07.749 --> 33:10.417
But I also don't want to be
enfeebled or bedridden.

33:13.587 --> 33:16.671
I only wish I was as brave as he is.

33:17.966 --> 33:20.883
I think you've been
more than brave.

33:21.594 --> 33:23.468
Have I?

33:26.182 --> 33:32.101
I wanted to set a good example,
serve my parish, do God's work...

33:32.271 --> 33:37.182
...as long as I was able,
and then go to glory...

33:37.359 --> 33:39.232
...with a modicum of grace.

33:43.156 --> 33:45.232
But there are times...

33:45.658 --> 33:51.493
...when I'm alone in prayer
or trying to get to sleep...

33:54.208 --> 33:57.707
...that it just overwhelms me.

33:59.505 --> 34:02.921
I should never feel
the way I do sometimes.

34:03.300 --> 34:04.580
How's that?

34:09.806 --> 34:11.928
Frightened.

34:16.312 --> 34:18.103
- You got the phone number, right?
- Yeah.

34:18.272 --> 34:20.976
You should call tomorrow and
make an appointment, you know?

34:21.150 --> 34:22.348
I'll see.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.652
Anyway, thanks.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.318
Yeah.

34:28.531 --> 34:30.440
Jeff?

34:31.076 --> 34:33.364
You gonna protect yourself
from now on?

34:33.786 --> 34:35.494
Maybe.

34:35.830 --> 34:37.786
Probably not.

34:42.795 --> 34:46.329
- Big plans tonight, Malucci?
- No. Just getting out of here.

34:46.505 --> 34:47.966
Go ahead, 104.

34:48.132 --> 34:49.793
At the home of a 65-year-old male.

34:49.967 --> 34:52.090
Collapsed in the bathroom.
Found him in V-fib.

34:52.262 --> 34:53.969
Haleh, can I take the mike?

34:54.139 --> 34:58.137
Defibrillated times four. Gave epi
and lidocaine. Now in asystole.

34:58.310 --> 34:59.472
He's gone.

34:59.644 --> 35:01.470
This is Dr. Greene.
What's the down time?

35:01.645 --> 35:04.812
Been here 15 minutes.
Probably down another 10 before that.

35:04.982 --> 35:06.097
Any medical history?

35:06.275 --> 35:08.980
Two MI's.
Status, post-bypass surgery.

35:09.153 --> 35:12.023
- The last doctor's appointment?
- Hold on.

35:12.197 --> 35:15.815
If he's seen a PMD within a month,
they can sign the death certificate.

35:15.993 --> 35:19.443
- Save us the trouble.
- Saw his cardiologist nine days ago.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.028
- Still in asystole?
- For the last five minutes.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.282
- That's it. Stop CPR.
- What?

35:24.458 --> 35:27.958
I'm pronouncing him.
Time of death, 2118.

35:28.129 --> 35:29.955
- Can you do that?
- Yeah. You can.

35:30.172 --> 35:33.173
Let the family know everything
was done under physician guidance...

35:33.342 --> 35:36.011
- ... but he did not respond.
- You want us to transport?

35:36.177 --> 35:37.921
No, have them
contact a funeral home.

35:38.138 --> 35:41.222
This is County General,
clear with Rescue 104.

35:41.391 --> 35:43.265
I don't know
why that was necessary.

35:43.435 --> 35:46.352
What's the point in going through
the motions?

35:47.104 --> 35:49.346
I'm looking for Dr. Kovac.

35:49.565 --> 35:52.981
I'm Dr. Frost, Bishop Stewart's
personal physician.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.648
- See? You were great.
- I had a good partner.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.197
If we get really motivated,
we could enter a contest.

36:03.369 --> 36:05.279
That might be too much
of a good thing.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.204
Thank you.

36:07.373 --> 36:10.043
- Oh, no.
- What?

36:11.836 --> 36:13.793
Hello, Abby.

36:14.505 --> 36:17.078
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

36:18.467 --> 36:22.216
I'm here with a friend.
John Carter.

36:22.971 --> 36:26.222
- How you doing?
- That's Richard.

36:30.103 --> 36:31.930
What are you doing
at a charity event?

36:32.147 --> 36:34.305
- I'm here with Alexis.
- Who?

36:34.565 --> 36:37.021
She went to get us drinks.

36:38.194 --> 36:39.439
She old enough to drink?

36:40.446 --> 36:45.072
- Rich, who's this?
- This is Abby.

36:45.242 --> 36:46.652
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:46.827 --> 36:48.903
- We should-
- Where've I seen that dress?

36:49.079 --> 36:50.324
- You haven't.
- I swear.

36:50.914 --> 36:52.906
I really don't think
you've ever seen it.

36:53.082 --> 36:55.918
My sister's wedding.
You were a bridesmaid.

36:57.378 --> 36:59.371
Always the gentleman, Richard.
Thank you.

37:00.923 --> 37:03.544
- Rich, let's go sit down.
- Okay. Nice meeting you.

37:06.470 --> 37:09.755
Am I awake or was that
just a nightmare?

37:10.307 --> 37:12.679
Last week I gave him IV Solu-Medrol
and put him on...

37:12.851 --> 37:15.341
- ... high-dose steroids for his arthritis.
- Last week?

37:15.521 --> 37:18.438
- Yeah, this is his second time here.
- He has diabetes.

37:18.606 --> 37:21.311
Steroids put him in the ICU
last year with DKA.

37:21.485 --> 37:22.599
I didn't know that!

37:22.777 --> 37:25.813
Which is why you should have
contacted his primary physician.

37:25.988 --> 37:27.981
- I was going to, but-
- What's his sugar?

37:28.157 --> 37:30.363
-348.
- Great work, doctor.

37:30.534 --> 37:33.654
You're destroying his vision,
his kidneys, his circulation.

37:33.829 --> 37:37.280
Now that I know about his diabetes,
I'm checking for end-organ damage.

37:37.500 --> 37:41.366
I've been treating Bishop Stewart for 15
years. He doesn't need another doctor.

37:41.544 --> 37:44.166
Maybe you should tell him that,
because he came to me.

37:44.381 --> 37:47.297
Underneath that robe,
he's just a man like everyone else.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.337
- A man facing death.
- And right now he's drug-seeking.

37:51.178 --> 37:55.128
- He just wants to feel right again.
- Well, that's not possible.

37:55.683 --> 37:57.474
Where is he?

37:57.643 --> 38:00.513
Okay, 104. See you at the back door.
This is County Base. Clear.

38:00.688 --> 38:02.976
- What's going on?
-104's bringing in a full arrest.

38:03.148 --> 38:05.900
- I just talked to that guy.
- Called en route. Cardiac arrest.

38:06.068 --> 38:07.396
I already pronounced him.

38:07.610 --> 38:09.982
- No, no, no.
- Gave him two of atropine en route.

38:10.154 --> 38:12.692
- What's your problem? We did this.
- The family freaked.

38:12.865 --> 38:15.320
- Do not unload the patient.
- We have to. We're here.

38:15.492 --> 38:16.691
He's been dead for an hour.

38:16.869 --> 38:18.529
Family wanted him to see a doctor.

38:18.704 --> 38:21.325
- Mark.
- Kerry, he's not supposed to be here.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.621
- Stop CPR.
- No. Resume compressions.

38:23.792 --> 38:26.033
I said stop. This is the guy
who died at home.

38:26.211 --> 38:29.331
Keep going, Cleo.
Set up Trauma 2 for a full arrest.

38:29.506 --> 38:32.043
- He's dead.
- When paramedics bring us a patient...

38:32.216 --> 38:34.126
...we have to care for him.

38:34.344 --> 38:36.502
- Chuny, wanna put a shroud on the bed?
- Shroud?

38:36.679 --> 38:39.170
Yeah, he's dead.
Might save some time.

38:39.349 --> 38:42.930
- Not gonna get him back, Kerry.
- We still try. You running this or am I?

38:43.101 --> 38:46.305
- Fine. What's his rhythm?
- Still asystole.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.315
What do you think? Another amp
of epi? Might get him back?

38:49.608 --> 38:54.519
Pupils fixed and dilated.
Hold compressions.

38:54.738 --> 38:57.572
Dr. Finch, would you concur
that the rhythm is asystole?

38:57.740 --> 38:59.816
- Yes.
- Code is over.

39:00.577 --> 39:02.948
Take out the tubes
and clean the body.

39:03.996 --> 39:05.075
That's the family.

39:07.625 --> 39:08.704
I hope this helped them.

39:09.251 --> 39:10.531
I'll go talk to them.

39:17.926 --> 39:21.709
So typical of him to cry poor and then
show up at this fancy party.

39:21.887 --> 39:23.679
And did you think she
was even pretty?

39:25.391 --> 39:27.965
- I don't think I'm gonna answer that.
- I don't see it.

39:28.144 --> 39:29.519
I think this is silly.

39:29.687 --> 39:32.770
- It's a blue BMW.
- What if they took her car?

39:32.939 --> 39:36.605
- What do you think she would drive?
- A Lexus?

39:36.777 --> 39:38.568
Get it? "Alexis"?

39:38.737 --> 39:41.572
No. I mean- Say we find it.
What are you gonna do, key it?

39:41.740 --> 39:45.737
- No. Maybe I'll just slash the tires.
- I think that would be overkill.

39:45.910 --> 39:49.325
Stop! Stop! Wait! There it is!

39:53.584 --> 39:55.660
- Do you have a pen?
- Yeah, why?

39:55.836 --> 39:58.541
- I'm letting the air out of the tires.
- How many tires?

39:58.714 --> 39:59.793
- Two's fair.
- One's fair.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.373
Fine. Pen, please.

40:11.935 --> 40:12.966
Now what do we do?

40:13.144 --> 40:15.551
I think we have to run.

40:22.444 --> 40:24.104
- He's awake?
- Yeah. And oriented.

40:24.279 --> 40:26.272
Passed mental-status
exam with flying colors.

40:26.448 --> 40:28.939
- Where are you taking him?
- He's got no neuro deficits.

40:29.117 --> 40:31.406
- He'll go to the ICU and be extubated.
- The heart?

40:31.578 --> 40:34.781
I'm gonna recommend surgery
to the transplant committee.

40:40.670 --> 40:42.543
Dr. Romano?

40:47.134 --> 40:49.803
Nick has requested
not to have the surgery.

40:49.969 --> 40:52.591
Well, he's a minor.
His parents make that call.

40:52.764 --> 40:55.136
You're gonna make him do it,
knowing how he feels?

40:55.308 --> 40:58.759
Dr. Kovac, he's a teenager.
What do they know about life?

40:58.936 --> 41:01.724
He'll thank us for this
in a few years.

41:08.195 --> 41:09.358
Mark.

41:09.530 --> 41:12.317
- I'm off, Kerry.
- We have to talk about this.

41:12.491 --> 41:13.902
And what might "this" be?

41:14.076 --> 41:16.483
The way you've been acting.
Abrupt, cavalier-

41:16.661 --> 41:17.942
Realistic?

41:18.121 --> 41:20.528
- Are you ready to be back?
- Yes, I am.

41:20.999 --> 41:23.834
- Mark, you're still reaching for words.
- I'm fine.

41:24.002 --> 41:26.326
What happens in a code
if you need a cardiac drug...

41:26.504 --> 41:28.793
- ...and you can't think of the name?
- Won't happen.

41:29.215 --> 41:33.294
- I'm asking you to take some time off.
- I'm telling you no.

41:40.976 --> 41:44.675
Dr. Frost is arranging for you
to have more tests on Monday.

41:44.854 --> 41:48.982
- Did he dress you down?
- He was pretty mad, yeah.

41:49.150 --> 41:51.819
He's very possessive about my care.
You were on his turf.

41:52.361 --> 41:56.311
Well, as I told him, your EKGs
and cardiac enzymes are normal.

41:56.741 --> 41:58.816
Thank you, Dr. Kovac.

41:58.992 --> 42:00.700
For the treatment and for listening.

42:01.077 --> 42:02.406
You're welcome.

42:06.207 --> 42:08.781
I saw they took the boy away.

42:09.002 --> 42:12.370
- Is he gonna get the operation then?
- Yeah.

42:12.839 --> 42:16.172
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

42:16.342 --> 42:19.378
You think he should have been able
to choose how he wanted to live?

42:22.722 --> 42:24.514
I think so.

42:26.810 --> 42:28.636
Well, I wanna work.

42:30.772 --> 42:33.144
Do you still want the steroids?

42:34.693 --> 42:35.724
I need to work.

42:57.380 --> 43:01.080
- Poor guy doesn't even have AAA.
- So he has to pay for this.

43:01.258 --> 43:02.587
Maybe Alexis will chip in.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.503
She looks about ready
to call a cab.

43:04.679 --> 43:07.086
I'd say we've successfully
ruined their evening.

43:07.723 --> 43:10.130
Mission accomplished.

43:14.855 --> 43:16.562
- Now I feel kind of bad.
- Why?

43:16.731 --> 43:18.522
Because I kind of
ruined our night too.

43:18.691 --> 43:20.768
Ruined, how?

43:22.278 --> 43:24.604
- Besides the vandalism?
- Yeah.

43:24.781 --> 43:26.440
- That we're freezing to death?
- Yeah.

43:26.616 --> 43:31.443
- You never saw your grandmother?
- She knows I was there. That's enough.

43:32.830 --> 43:35.499
Okay, then, I guess nothing.

43:39.294 --> 43:41.619
I had an okay time.

43:42.631 --> 43:44.623
Me too.

44:00.105 --> 44:02.477
This is Kerry Weaver at County.

44:02.649 --> 44:06.693
I need information about
evaluating a physician...

44:06.861 --> 44:11.357
...who's possibly
cognitively impaired.

44:13.409 --> 44:16.363
Could we speak first thing
Monday morning?

44:16.537 --> 44:18.410
Thanks.
