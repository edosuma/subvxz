00:02.087 --> 00:04.089
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.589 --> 00:05.632
You're pursuing Andrew.

00:05.715 --> 00:08.134
And I've re-tasked a group of
S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to look for him.

00:08.218 --> 00:09.386
I can help.

00:09.469 --> 00:10.512
What is that?

00:12.055 --> 00:13.098
HYDRA.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.307
<i>I made some moves this week</i>

00:14.391 --> 00:17.185
to ensure we have all the Inhumans
we need when the time comes.

00:17.268 --> 00:18.311
Why go to all this trouble?

00:18.395 --> 00:19.813
I'm building an army.

00:19.896 --> 00:21.481
Malick is supposed to be
the last head of HYDRA,

00:21.564 --> 00:24.693
but I can't shake this feeling
that he's reporting to someone else.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.570
<i>Someone more powerful than Malick?</i>

00:27.654 --> 00:30.323
Someone or something.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.738
Starting fires now, huh?

01:09.821 --> 01:12.240
No, no. Don't want trouble.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.783
Just needed, um...

01:15.660 --> 01:16.786
Art supplies.

01:16.870 --> 01:20.331
- It's Charlie, right?
- Well, Charles.

01:20.832 --> 01:23.418
Look, I can't have you
sleeping back here any more.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.336
It's not good for business.

01:25.837 --> 01:28.923
- I'm about to open.
- Okay. But, um...

01:29.299 --> 01:31.676
But I could help out if you want.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.304
Sweep up or, you know,
anything else you need.

01:34.387 --> 01:36.264
I just need you to clear out.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.141
The sun will up in a few minutes.

01:38.224 --> 01:40.143
There's a shelter over on Ninth.

01:44.189 --> 01:45.440
Look...

01:48.026 --> 01:50.111
Grab yourself some breakfast
on the way.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.280
No, no, no, no.

01:52.363 --> 01:53.948
No, I don't want any trouble.

01:54.032 --> 01:55.200
You seem like a nice guy.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.702
I just need to keep the customers I got.
Now, take it.

02:00.580 --> 02:03.833
Daisy, help. Save me, please.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.043
So sorry.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.754
We're running out of time, Daisy.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.715
This is where I die.

02:17.472 --> 02:19.015
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
Please calm down.</i>

02:19.098 --> 02:20.308
<i>I'm having a hard time
understanding you.</i>

02:20.391 --> 02:23.311
<i>There's someone coming here
to kill me. HYDRA.</i>

02:23.394 --> 02:25.563
<i>Sir, we're sending
two cars to your location.</i>

02:25.647 --> 02:26.815
<i>No, there's no time for that.</i>

02:26.898 --> 02:29.400
<i>- I need Daisy Johnson.</i>
<i>- Who?</i>

02:29.484 --> 02:31.945
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors
emergency dispatch?

02:32.070 --> 02:34.697
All the time, all over the world.
It's how we're first on the scene.

02:34.781 --> 02:36.366
Who was the caller?

02:36.449 --> 02:40.119
Man identified himself as Edwin Abbot.

02:40.245 --> 02:42.539
Owns a local grocery store
in Dyker Heights.

02:42.622 --> 02:43.873
No affiliation with S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:43.957 --> 02:45.750
or any intelligence agency,
for that matter.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.836
- Just a guy.
- You don't know him?

02:47.919 --> 02:49.754
Never seen him, never heard of him.

02:50.797 --> 02:52.841
- Prepare the Quinjet for disconnect.
- Yes, sir.

02:52.924 --> 02:54.926
- He knew your name.
- And mentioned HYDRA.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.719
- Can't be good.
- May even be a trap.

02:56.803 --> 02:58.388
We'll need ground tactical at the ready.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.806
You're coming? Good.

02:59.931 --> 03:01.683
With Mack on bed rest,
we could use the extra muscle.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.101
Well, he's the only one
with extra muscles,

03:03.184 --> 03:04.227
but I'll come anyway.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.812
We don't know what we're walking into.

03:15.780 --> 03:16.948
Slow down, and tell me again.

03:17.657 --> 03:21.035
I already told you. I'm not crazy.
This is happening.

03:22.453 --> 03:23.955
There. There she is.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.040
- And who are you, now?
- Daisy Johnson, ATCU.

03:26.124 --> 03:27.208
Um, Edwin, right?

03:28.001 --> 03:29.627
How did you know my name, Edwin,

03:29.711 --> 03:30.879
when you called 911?

03:31.337 --> 03:33.131
Because I heard you say it just now.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.049
Uh, what are you saying?

03:35.133 --> 03:36.843
- I saw this.
- You saw what?

03:36.968 --> 03:40.138
This moment, talking to you,
the cops, all of it.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.264
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

03:41.347 --> 03:43.516
Charles, the crazy homeless guy
who lives in the alley,

03:43.641 --> 03:46.269
he must have put a curse on me
or something.

03:46.352 --> 03:49.022
He made me see this. I saw this.

03:49.689 --> 03:50.773
I'm gonna go check that out.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.650
You got to get me out of here
before they come and kill me.

03:52.734 --> 03:53.818
Okay. We will protect you.

03:53.902 --> 03:56.446
But how did you know
that it was HYDRA who's coming?

03:56.529 --> 03:59.908
Because that's what she'll yell
when they come out of the sky.

04:05.872 --> 04:07.165
HYDRA!

04:11.044 --> 04:12.337
Go!

04:20.762 --> 04:22.347
Six o'clock!

04:33.441 --> 04:34.567
Help!

04:34.692 --> 04:35.944
Save me, please!

04:36.027 --> 04:37.362
Don't worry. I'll get you out of this.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.696
Just lay low for a second.

04:38.780 --> 04:41.074
We're running out of time. Daisy...

04:42.116 --> 04:43.785
This is where I die.

04:44.953 --> 04:46.371
No. No!

04:49.624 --> 04:51.376
The man's Inhuman.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.754
The homeless man's Inhuman.
They're after him!

04:59.550 --> 05:00.802
No! No!

05:21.906 --> 05:24.575
I was hoping you could help.

05:34.127 --> 05:35.336
Hey.

05:36.254 --> 05:37.797
Hey, hey. You all right?

05:37.922 --> 05:40.008
Daisy, talk to me. Breathe.

05:40.091 --> 05:41.175
We need medical!

05:41.259 --> 05:43.052
I know. I'm sorry. We lost one.

05:43.136 --> 05:45.638
No. No.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.849
What's wrong? What is it?

05:54.522 --> 05:56.524
It hasn't happened yet.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.124
He is risen!

06:13.207 --> 06:15.877
What an improvement.
Last time I saw you,

06:15.960 --> 06:19.130
you looked like an extra
from <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.674
And now, now you're a man
who can inspire.

06:21.799 --> 06:25.136
To what do we owe
this miraculous turnaround?

06:26.679 --> 06:27.972
To your patience.

06:36.689 --> 06:39.275
A thank-you is overdue.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.818
For bringing me back.

06:41.319 --> 06:44.238
Well, I didn't exactly
move heaven and earth, uh,

06:44.322 --> 06:48.576
but I did move a lot of earth,
money, manpower,

06:48.659 --> 06:50.078
anything to make it happen.

06:51.079 --> 06:53.247
I'd like to know why.

06:53.331 --> 06:54.749
Why?

06:55.333 --> 06:56.751
Meaning, to what end?

06:57.543 --> 06:58.753
Why? I, uh...

07:04.842 --> 07:07.095
My family, my ancestors

07:07.178 --> 07:10.431
were taught to believe
that if we managed to return you

07:10.515 --> 07:13.518
from that godforsaken place,
that we would be rewarded.

07:14.185 --> 07:15.895
With what?

07:16.687 --> 07:18.731
Together,

07:18.856 --> 07:21.442
we are supposed to take over the world.

07:21.526 --> 07:24.362
And what does that look like to you?

07:28.407 --> 07:30.910
You have $9.2 billion.

07:31.035 --> 07:35.373
The influence that comes with any
object of your desire can be yours.

07:36.207 --> 07:37.959
That's not enough?

07:43.131 --> 07:47.468
What can I give you
that you couldn't have before?

07:47.552 --> 07:52.390
Look, I've dedicated my life,
surrendered my life to a higher power.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.766
That's the word.

07:55.768 --> 07:56.978
Power.

07:57.979 --> 07:59.272
And that's what you seek,

07:59.397 --> 08:04.902
not wealth, or control, or clout. No.

08:05.570 --> 08:06.988
True power.

08:08.406 --> 08:09.949
How does that sound?

08:14.162 --> 08:15.413
Intriguing.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.460
It's time to go above ground,

08:23.588 --> 08:24.922
and finally show you

08:25.673 --> 08:28.634
what true power really feels like.

08:36.142 --> 08:37.977
You're sure it was the future?

08:39.604 --> 08:42.607
- My whole face was covered in...
- Mmm-hmm.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.110
And Coulson shoots you?

08:47.653 --> 08:48.779
Yep.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.950
Then I'll just ask the question

08:53.034 --> 08:54.368
that someone should ask at some point.

08:54.452 --> 08:55.745
Is this even possible?

08:55.828 --> 08:56.871
Well, Hermann Minkowski
would say yes.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.497
Technically, it's
fourth-dimensional perspective.

08:58.623 --> 09:00.291
That guy Edwin predicted
everything that happened.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.168
- That's a dumb question.
- Okay, got it.

09:02.293 --> 09:04.503
So, we all agree it's possible.
Now what?

09:04.629 --> 09:06.297
- I can change it.
- No.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.715
We can reverse-engineer the visions,

09:07.798 --> 09:09.926
figure out where this went down,
and get there ahead of it.

09:10.009 --> 09:11.844
- Save that poor man.
- You can't.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.597
I mean, fourth-dimensionally
speaking, is all.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.475
If you saw the future,
then that's the future.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.229
I don't want to believe that.

09:21.312 --> 09:25.816
I can't explain how it felt,
but it was awful.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.193
I felt so helpless.

09:27.318 --> 09:29.111
I was inches away from him.

09:29.195 --> 09:30.404
I have to save him.

09:30.488 --> 09:32.198
Edwin called in
with your name for a reason.

09:32.323 --> 09:33.574
Maybe you're meant to change it.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.534
And we know what this homeless man,
Charles, looks like.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.702
And we're running a search.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.746
If Daisy can remember details
about the location

09:38.829 --> 09:39.997
and we get there in time, we...

09:40.081 --> 09:42.375
Guys, there is no time.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.002
She glimpsed the fourth dimension.
Time is an illusion.

09:45.086 --> 09:48.965
It's how we perceive
the fourth dimension. Simmons.

09:49.048 --> 09:51.467
It's mathematics.
He's talking about space-time.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.594
How do you... How can I explain this?

09:53.678 --> 09:55.596
Right.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.098
We're 3-D, yeah?

09:57.181 --> 10:01.686
Okay, but imagine we lived
in a two-dimensional existence,

10:01.769 --> 10:03.854
flat, just like a piece of paper.

10:03.938 --> 10:06.899
We wouldn't be able to conceive
of three dimensions,

10:07.024 --> 10:11.946
of a cube, or anything
that's not two-dimensional, okay?

10:12.029 --> 10:13.406
Yeah. Right, so,

10:14.031 --> 10:18.077
we flat-paper people would perceive

10:18.786 --> 10:21.205
this three-dimensional cube

10:21.289 --> 10:24.875
as many separate
two-dimensional moments.

10:26.252 --> 10:31.215
As time passing, the point on the line
travelling through space and time.

10:32.425 --> 10:34.635
But, in fact, the cube, the line is fixed.

10:34.719 --> 10:35.845
Yeah, it's just sitting there.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.973
There's no future.
There's no past. It just...

10:39.056 --> 10:40.516
It just is.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.185
And nothing you can do
will change that.

10:43.269 --> 10:44.729
You're hurting my brain.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.064
Look, I don't know if Fitz is right

10:47.148 --> 10:49.025
or if I even understand
what he's saying, really,

10:49.108 --> 10:50.860
but HYDRA has this guy.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.320
And we got to try to stop them.

10:53.321 --> 10:54.530
I think I might have a strategy.

10:54.613 --> 10:55.906
We're all ears.

10:56.907 --> 11:00.578
All we have to do to guarantee
that we change the outcome

11:00.661 --> 11:02.204
is not let Daisy out of the base.

11:02.288 --> 11:04.415
What? No. I have to go help him.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.916
The one thing we know for certain

11:06.000 --> 11:08.044
is that Daisy was at the centre
of these visions,

11:08.127 --> 11:09.795
whereas May doesn't appear
in any of them.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.423
Look, I get the logic,
but I can handle this myself.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.633
I'm sorry. May goes instead.

11:14.759 --> 11:16.427
Coulson.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.012
I was meant to save him.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.139
If you want to try
to stop this man from dying,

11:20.264 --> 11:22.266
then this is how we're doing it.
Understood?

11:25.811 --> 11:28.647
Lincoln and I will chase down
any intel we can on the homeless man.

11:28.773 --> 11:31.567
Daisy, remember every detail you can
about where this happens,

11:31.650 --> 11:32.735
and then we'll send May.

11:32.818 --> 11:33.944
No one else goes.

11:34.028 --> 11:36.697
I won't pick up a gun
until this is finished.

11:36.781 --> 11:38.532
And Fitz-Simmons will stay
out of the damn snow.

11:40.868 --> 11:41.952
Are we clear?

11:49.043 --> 11:52.588
Got to admit, this time stuff's
always been a little over my head.

11:52.671 --> 11:53.798
Like in <i>Terminator,</i>

11:53.881 --> 11:55.841
if John Connor's alive
and able to send his friend

11:55.966 --> 11:58.302
back in time to save his mom
to make sure he's born,

11:58.386 --> 12:00.638
doesn't that mean he doesn't have to?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.890
I, uh, never saw the original <i>Terminator.</i>

12:02.973 --> 12:04.350
You're off the team.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.727
What's tripping me out

12:06.811 --> 12:09.855
is that we only knew
to try to save the guy

12:09.980 --> 12:14.235
because he heard Daisy's name
when we went to try to save the guy.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.444
I know, right?

12:15.528 --> 12:18.781
But that's what makes me think
it happened for a reason.

12:18.864 --> 12:19.990
It's design.

12:21.242 --> 12:23.744
Sure. We're all part of some grand plan.

12:23.828 --> 12:25.746
Only problem is,
we never know what the plan is.

12:25.830 --> 12:28.290
No, I mean, Inhumans were designed.

12:28.374 --> 12:31.419
And our powers
were designed not to be random,

12:31.502 --> 12:34.004
but to fill a need, a gap that's missing.

12:34.088 --> 12:35.131
So Raina...

12:35.214 --> 12:36.841
Everything she said came true.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.969
Yes, but because of that,
Daisy was able to stop Jiaying.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.805
Daisy will be able to help this guy
Charles, whoever he is.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.473
Change the outcome?

12:44.557 --> 12:45.850
I hope so.

12:46.684 --> 12:49.019
Your face was covered in blood.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.064
That's him.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.817
Charles Hinton. Last known address...

12:55.901 --> 12:58.362
Sadly, it looks like Charles
did not live alone.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.448
- Send a team.
- Yes, sir.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.658
I wouldn't worry about me, sir.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.201
You should worry about yourself.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.995
Because Daisy saw me shoot her?

13:07.538 --> 13:09.832
Because I'd kill you if you did.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.211
I was hoping you could help.

13:19.216 --> 13:22.386
There's a red metal staircase nearby.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.680
It's a rooftop, 20 storeys, at least.

13:25.890 --> 13:30.436
And the light was weird.
Maybe a flashing billboard behind me?

13:31.270 --> 13:35.399
<i>I wish I could remember more clearly.
They're probably taking him there now.</i>

13:38.777 --> 13:40.446
<i>And whatever bad thing happens,</i>

13:41.238 --> 13:42.740
I feel like it happens tonight.

13:46.744 --> 13:47.912
What are you doing?

13:48.037 --> 13:49.955
I'm trying to find the building.

13:50.080 --> 13:54.502
I've re-tasked the S.H.I.E.L.D. servers
to search for keywords we're feeding in.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.754
- Not all the servers.
- Yeah, all of them.

13:56.879 --> 13:57.922
Daisy...

13:58.047 --> 13:59.632
May, if I'm not allowed
to go on the mission myself,

13:59.757 --> 14:01.800
then I'm sure as hell gonna
do everything I can from here.

14:01.926 --> 14:03.594
Not all of them!

14:06.430 --> 14:07.556
Got it?

14:11.227 --> 14:14.021
She and I have built a similar
algorithm to find Dr Garner,

14:14.104 --> 14:16.440
and a number of the servers
are running it.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.818
We're both understandably
desperate to find him.

14:20.486 --> 14:22.154
No worries.
I'll leave those servers alone.

14:32.748 --> 14:35.334
Do you think we can do it?
Change the future?

14:36.418 --> 14:39.004
Every move we make
changes the future.

14:39.129 --> 14:42.174
The real feat
would be changing the past.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.272
- It's you.
- Oh.

14:57.106 --> 14:59.316
You touched him, didn't you?

15:00.818 --> 15:02.778
Charles Hinton's wife.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.280
He was a teacher, well-liked,

15:04.363 --> 15:06.949
but he walked out on her and
their 18-month-old daughter in July.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.200
Walked out? Why?

15:08.325 --> 15:09.618
<i>It drove him crazy.</i>

15:10.661 --> 15:12.329
<i>When did it start?</i>

15:14.540 --> 15:17.001
It was a Sunday.

15:17.126 --> 15:19.211
We'd just gotten home
from the farmer's market,

15:19.336 --> 15:21.171
and it started to pour.

15:21.297 --> 15:25.509
Charles ran out to the yard
to bring our daughter's toys inside.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.304
And I hear him howl like he hurt himself.

15:29.513 --> 15:30.848
I ran out

15:30.973 --> 15:36.186
and found him on the ground
covered with some kind of crust.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.898
I took his hand...

15:41.525 --> 15:43.027
And we saw flashes,

15:44.153 --> 15:48.032
random events,
ending with a horrific car crash.

15:48.157 --> 15:49.366
He sees it, too?

15:50.326 --> 15:52.369
We just sat there, shocked.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.164
But then, leading him inside,
it happened again.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.415
We saw...

15:58.542 --> 16:00.794
We saw my mother in a hospital bed.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.713
Code blue.

16:03.589 --> 16:06.091
So, you had to stop physical contact?

16:06.216 --> 16:08.469
We thought we were going crazy.

16:08.552 --> 16:13.140
But it would happen any time Charles
touched anyone.

16:13.223 --> 16:17.186
He and that person
would both see someone's death.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.479
<i>A death?</i>

16:18.562 --> 16:22.358
<i>That was probably
enough to make Charles go mad,</i>

16:22.441 --> 16:24.943
but then it got so much worse
a few days later when...

16:25.069 --> 16:27.071
The visions started coming true.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.701
Did he ever try
to stop them from happening?

16:32.785 --> 16:34.495
Of course!

16:34.578 --> 16:38.290
Of course he tried, over and over.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.126
That's what sent him over the edge,
I guess.

16:41.251 --> 16:44.129
He couldn't make a difference, not one.

16:45.089 --> 16:46.882
He was powerless.

16:50.469 --> 16:53.347
<i>Is there any other detail that you could
share with us that could help?</i>

16:53.430 --> 16:55.099
Could you tell us about the bird?

16:56.308 --> 16:57.476
Bird?

16:57.601 --> 16:59.687
Charles carved a little bird,

16:59.770 --> 17:03.899
I think it was a robin, out of wood.

17:04.483 --> 17:06.068
He did?

17:08.444 --> 17:11.531
That's our daughter's name, Robin.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.826
Charles left in the night,

17:13.951 --> 17:16.662
and he didn't take anything but a jacket.

17:16.787 --> 17:18.247
He left because

17:18.329 --> 17:22.584
he would never be able
to hold his little girl again.

17:27.506 --> 17:32.636
At least, not without her crying
and screaming and seeing death.

17:35.806 --> 17:38.976
What's so pressing
that it couldn't wait a few days, Gideon?

17:39.143 --> 17:43.147
Well, you know me.
I seize opportunity.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.109
This state-of-the-art prosthetic

17:47.192 --> 17:51.572
contains some hardware
manufactured by you here at Transia.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.825
The nerve-wire interface, to be precise.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.953
Okay.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.205
And I'm aware

18:00.330 --> 18:04.835
your company's been working on
an exo-skeletal limb-assist prototype

18:04.960 --> 18:08.505
for the Defence Department
using this same technology.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.300
So, I'd like to buy it.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.010
Buy one of our leading patents.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.721
No, no. The company.

18:17.473 --> 18:18.849
Can you repeat yourself?

18:18.974 --> 18:21.685
I must be losing it,
but I thought I just heard you...

18:21.810 --> 18:24.938
I'd like you to sign
your company over to me,

18:25.022 --> 18:26.732
for a fair price, of course.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.738
Yeah. Uh...

18:33.655 --> 18:36.700
Look, there's no love lost between us.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.620
And though I respect the brass it took
to make that pitch,

18:39.703 --> 18:42.372
I'm really not into people
wasting my time.

18:42.498 --> 18:44.249
I hate it.

18:45.501 --> 18:47.336
This would be in your best interest.

18:47.419 --> 18:48.837
Who the hell is this?

18:50.047 --> 18:53.467
This man has my full authority
to negotiate this deal.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.219
Negotiate?

18:55.344 --> 18:58.096
Gideon, there is not a chance in hell
that I am gonna sell you

18:58.222 --> 19:02.267
a single share of this company,
let alone controlling interest.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.198
Let me show you what will happen.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.707
I'm sorry.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.717
Oh, God! Okay!

19:37.928 --> 19:40.055
I'll give you what you want.

19:43.725 --> 19:44.935
Please.

19:45.936 --> 19:47.396
There, okay?

19:48.272 --> 19:50.440
Just leave!

19:50.566 --> 19:52.734
Leave us alone, okay? Please!

19:53.443 --> 19:54.611
You're confused.

19:56.947 --> 19:59.074
I said I would show you
what will happen.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.013
I can't believe this.

20:22.347 --> 20:25.017
Our men are taking control
of the building as we speak.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.481
This is what we went to
all this trouble for?

20:34.443 --> 20:36.028
What do you want with this?

20:36.695 --> 20:38.488
I want you to put it on.

20:40.449 --> 20:41.575
Come on.

20:41.658 --> 20:44.786
Whether you'll admit it or not, Gideon,

20:44.870 --> 20:50.208
the one thing you crave
and have never felt is true power.

20:50.334 --> 20:55.005
The kind that I, Giyera,
even Charles there possesses.

21:02.888 --> 21:05.223
Put that on, and you will.

21:19.738 --> 21:22.699
You still think you should be going.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.327
I know I can do it.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.412
And you think I can't.

21:27.537 --> 21:28.580
I have an advantage.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.916
I can't cause earthquakes,
but I'm faster than you.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.376
Foresight. I know what's coming.

21:34.378 --> 21:36.755
Then get off your ass and show me.

21:40.842 --> 21:43.595
You can picture this fight
in the security office?

21:43.720 --> 21:46.181
Yeah, I only get to Charles
a few seconds late.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.767
So, let's lay out the room
as best we can.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.852
They'll be the guards, and you show me

21:50.936 --> 21:52.396
how to get through it
a few seconds faster.

21:52.521 --> 21:53.981
Okay.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.273
Yeah, all right.

21:55.399 --> 21:57.567
There's a bank of servers
on the left side,

21:57.693 --> 22:01.571
and we'll need chairs on wheels,
two of them and two more bodies.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.872
Make sure they have a security team
watching the house.

22:10.956 --> 22:12.874
And buy the little girl something nice.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.292
Yes, sir.

22:17.129 --> 22:19.256
No, Fitz, you're supposed to...
What's your name again, man?

22:19.381 --> 22:20.382
Doug.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.967
Doug. You're supposed to come in
on the heels of Doug.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.093
Okay.

22:23.218 --> 22:24.803
And, Lincoln, I'll just...

22:24.928 --> 22:26.430
I'll give you a separate cue to come in.

22:26.555 --> 22:28.348
I'm playing "freak out
and go for the alarm" guy.

22:28.432 --> 22:31.226
- Good luck with that.
- All right, reset.

22:33.603 --> 22:35.105
Right when she opens the door.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.606
Ready whenever you are, May.

22:50.662 --> 22:51.913
- Shoot him.
- Bang.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.666
Please, no!

22:57.127 --> 22:58.211
Bang.

22:59.880 --> 23:00.922
Bang.

23:02.466 --> 23:03.550
Under the table!

23:03.633 --> 23:04.634
Bang.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.099
Simmons.

23:16.646 --> 23:17.939
- Fall down!
- Sorry.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.566
Lincoln, go.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.234
Grab the knife.

23:25.489 --> 23:27.657
Wish we could practise
every moment of our life like this.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.160
That was terrible. Fitz?

23:30.243 --> 23:31.495
You come right after Doug.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.914
Okay, I come in right
at the heels of Doug!

23:33.997 --> 23:35.916
And, May, are you telling me
that is your best side kick?

23:35.999 --> 23:37.417
I was trying to miss her face.

23:38.502 --> 23:40.420
- It would be so much easier...
- If I had your powers?

23:40.504 --> 23:42.255
Well, it wouldn't hurt.

23:42.339 --> 23:45.592
All right, it's got to be faster. Come on.
Reset. Reset.

24:22.546 --> 24:23.797
It does feel good.

24:24.840 --> 24:25.882
Yes.

24:25.966 --> 24:29.886
But crushing objects with your hand
isn't the sensation I was talking about.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.140
Okay.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.684
If you want to feel true power,

24:37.060 --> 24:38.353
crush him.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.315
No. Please, God, no. No!

24:42.399 --> 24:43.817
What will that achieve?

24:46.069 --> 24:47.237
No, no, no!

24:48.196 --> 24:49.739
Gideon, please, don't do this!

24:49.823 --> 24:52.492
I'll give you anything! I did!
I'm too young to die!

24:52.576 --> 24:54.077
God! Oh, no!

24:55.078 --> 24:57.581
I know you've had people killed.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.000
You've even considered
shooting someone.

25:01.585 --> 25:04.337
But to drain a man's life
with your own hand,

25:04.421 --> 25:07.090
to feel the life go out inside him...

25:09.676 --> 25:12.762
As Mr Coulson did with me.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.266
That look in his eyes.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.853
A feeling so powerful, it scared him.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.106
Enough to leave that hand behind.

25:27.068 --> 25:29.112
But you don't fear anything, do you?

25:46.755 --> 25:48.632
Reset. Reset.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.050
You don't think May can conquer this.

25:50.133 --> 25:51.635
I'm just worried about
what turn of events

25:51.760 --> 25:53.553
- is gonna stop her from going...
- Come on.

25:53.637 --> 25:54.638
'Cause we already know
that she doesn't.

25:54.763 --> 25:58.141
I refuse to believe anything
is completely inevitable.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.309
We'll see.

26:04.814 --> 26:05.941
Ready when you are!

26:16.576 --> 26:17.619
Bang, bang.

26:22.415 --> 26:23.458
Bang.

26:24.834 --> 26:25.835
Bang.

26:27.337 --> 26:28.338
Bang.

26:34.511 --> 26:35.595
Lincoln.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.188
That was pretty damn good.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.649
Sir, we found the building.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.113
That's it.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.447
And shocker, the only way in

26:54.531 --> 26:56.866
is through their security office
on the ground floor.

26:56.950 --> 26:59.703
Transia Corporation. I know of it,
but what would Malick want in there?

26:59.828 --> 27:01.788
I used their nerve-wiring
interface in your hand, sir.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.457
- It's cutting edge, to say the least.
- Okay, this is getting crazy.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.001
It's been crazy.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.629
All right, May, surgical strike.

27:09.713 --> 27:11.464
And we agree, no comms on this.

27:11.548 --> 27:12.882
HYDRA will be listening.

27:13.008 --> 27:14.050
And know we're coming

27:14.134 --> 27:15.802
if they really have
a fortune-teller on hand.

27:15.885 --> 27:18.972
And if you see Charles,
do not go up to the roof, even if he...

27:20.890 --> 27:22.851
- Uh, what does that mean?
- Intruder.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.867
He just walked in, sir.
Surrendered himself.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.161
Why?

27:41.244 --> 27:43.079
Lash is taking over.

27:45.248 --> 27:47.417
I'm about to turn for the last time, May.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.838
I came to say goodbye.

28:03.767 --> 28:06.936
Well, at least this day
can't get any weirder.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.939
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but May can't go.

28:10.065 --> 28:11.441
What? Yes, I can.

28:11.566 --> 28:12.776
You heard him.

28:12.901 --> 28:14.444
Andrew's going away for good.
You have to...

28:14.527 --> 28:15.862
That man is a killer.

28:15.945 --> 28:17.697
I have no loyalty to him.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.449
The man that I cared about
wouldn't do those things.

28:19.532 --> 28:22.786
He wasn't himself. And now he's saying
he may never be himself again.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.204
If you don't go be with him right now,

28:24.287 --> 28:25.955
you're gonna regret that
for the rest of your life.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.123
I'll do it, May.

28:27.791 --> 28:28.875
Absolutely not.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.877
Sir, I'm the best choice to handle this,
and since Bobbi's gone,

28:30.960 --> 28:32.128
I'm the only one left who can.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.546
You're not unstoppable, Daisy.

28:33.630 --> 28:34.881
I'm willing to put that to the test.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.467
And test Fitz's theory that all this
will play out just as you envisioned?

28:37.592 --> 28:40.303
Everyone else stays back
to make sure we're still altering the end.

28:40.387 --> 28:42.555
You, Lincoln, no one leaves HQ.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.265
Coulson, I can do this.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.476
I am meant to save this man.

28:46.976 --> 28:48.478
I can feel it.

28:49.813 --> 28:50.980
Let me go.

28:54.651 --> 28:57.070
The assault team will remain
on the Quinjet unless needed.

28:57.153 --> 29:00.573
Fitz will tap the Transia building's
security feeds to get eyes on you.

29:00.657 --> 29:04.160
And remember, we don't know
what happens after that last instant.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.079
- It might not be pretty.
- I know.

29:07.997 --> 29:09.582
Hey.

29:09.666 --> 29:10.834
Watch your back.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.336
If it goes south, get out.
Don't try to be a hero.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.755
And for God's sake, Skye, come home.

29:15.839 --> 29:16.923
It's Daisy, sir.

29:17.006 --> 29:20.427
Damn it. Daisy, right, Daisy. Just...

29:20.510 --> 29:21.970
Come home safe.

29:44.033 --> 29:45.660
Shouldn't you be behind glass?

29:46.995 --> 29:48.997
I'll get out when I need to.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.500
So, what's in the IV?

29:53.835 --> 29:56.546
Something Simmons has been
working on, a potential vaccine.

29:57.338 --> 29:59.883
Never been tested, may not even work,

29:59.966 --> 30:03.720
and even then, only on Inhumans
who haven't changed yet.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.388
But since you're still transitioning...

30:05.513 --> 30:06.890
So it's a Hail Mary.

30:07.474 --> 30:09.184
It's a long shot, yeah.

30:13.396 --> 30:15.982
If you're gonna say something, say it,
'cause I'm not gonna stay long.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.026
I'm not here to repair.

30:19.486 --> 30:23.323
I know I can't fix any of it. I just...

30:23.406 --> 30:24.574
I've been thinking it through.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.493
I have to think through it
like a psychologist.

30:26.576 --> 30:27.702
Spit it out.

30:28.411 --> 30:30.997
I wanted to tell you that...

30:31.080 --> 30:34.083
I know becoming Inhuman changed me.

30:34.209 --> 30:37.253
And you needed a PhD
to figure that out?

30:37.337 --> 30:38.588
What I'm saying is, I...

30:38.713 --> 30:41.007
What I said before, that I'm
the same man you married...

30:41.090 --> 30:44.177
That's not true.
You weren't a killer when I married you.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.595
I know. I know that now.

30:46.262 --> 30:49.933
A little of him is in me all the time.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.351
That was him talking.

30:52.936 --> 30:55.021
And there's some of you in him.

30:55.104 --> 30:57.440
That allowed you to talk me down? Yes.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.943
But this time, when I turn, I...

31:02.445 --> 31:05.448
I'm afraid I'll be gone forever.

31:10.912 --> 31:13.081
If you could fix it,

31:13.873 --> 31:17.418
if you could change the past,
would you?

31:17.961 --> 31:19.087
Yes.

31:20.046 --> 31:23.299
But I want this monster
in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hands

31:23.424 --> 31:25.218
because despite knowing
my actions were wrong,

31:25.301 --> 31:28.596
I still feel that I was doing it all
for an important reason.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.474
That's the monster
talking again.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.142
Maybe.

31:33.226 --> 31:36.312
But I feel like he's fighting for a cause
we don't understand yet.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.648
And I don't know...

31:40.316 --> 31:42.151
You might need him.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.822
We're tapped in.

31:45.947 --> 31:49.242
It's a pirated wireless signal,
so touch-and-go.

31:52.662 --> 31:54.747
- Can you find the security office?
- Wait.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.165
Is that Giyera?

31:56.291 --> 31:58.334
That's him.
I'd know his face anywhere.

32:00.003 --> 32:01.921
You hear what Andrew
was saying, Lincoln?

32:02.005 --> 32:04.424
Even he thinks he's serving
some higher purpose.

32:04.507 --> 32:07.010
Yeah. Maybe it's true, then.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.846
Maybe Daisy and Charles
were brought together for a reason.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.431
Could be.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.183
Also, could be you all are
crazy and this is pointless

32:14.309 --> 32:15.435
and nothing we see here
will make any sense...

32:15.518 --> 32:16.769
What?

32:21.357 --> 32:22.984
Was that Ward?

32:24.360 --> 32:26.863
Unfortunately,

32:26.988 --> 32:28.698
I think that's something else.

32:30.450 --> 32:33.620
My God. What is she walking into?

32:42.670 --> 32:44.213
<i>Would I change things if I could?</i>

32:44.339 --> 32:46.174
You weren't asking
about becoming Inhuman.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.134
I was talking about us.

32:50.553 --> 32:53.348
Every terrible thing
that has happened to you

32:53.431 --> 32:56.351
could have been avoided
if you'd never met me.

33:03.316 --> 33:05.026
I wouldn't change a thing.

33:08.488 --> 33:10.156
I would.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.367
Well...

33:12.450 --> 33:16.287
You're still the centre
of the best moments of my life.

33:16.829 --> 33:20.958
Whether this vaccine works or not,
right now, with you here...

33:23.211 --> 33:25.630
Is exactly where I'm supposed to be.

34:15.679 --> 34:16.931
One-way mirror.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.074
- Guess it's a good thing I was here.
- How did you know that...

34:36.159 --> 34:37.577
We've been monitoring
the security feed.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.120
Oh, and by the way,

34:39.203 --> 34:41.831
your chances of not going up
to the roof just evaporated.

34:41.914 --> 34:43.498
HYDRA's already taking
Charles there now.

34:43.583 --> 34:44.751
Get moving.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.295
Okay. Wait. What are you gonna do?

34:48.087 --> 34:49.505
Find Grant Ward.

34:50.965 --> 34:52.132
Yeah.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.010
Day got weirder.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.264
They've breached the security office.

34:58.347 --> 35:00.141
Mr Malick is taking
the company's helicopter,

35:00.224 --> 35:03.478
but I'd rather sneak you out
another way if S.H.I.E.L.D. is present.

35:03.561 --> 35:05.271
We'll try to scramble
their communications.

35:05.354 --> 35:07.565
Should I give the order to kill
any S.H.I.E.L.D. agents?

35:07.648 --> 35:08.733
Only if they're human.

35:14.864 --> 35:20.036
So, the security entrance, north side.
All right, let's go!

35:20.119 --> 35:21.954
- And we?
- We don't go any closer.

35:22.038 --> 35:25.291
We stay here without a cloud in the sky.

35:26.334 --> 35:28.211
Maybe Daisy didn't see the future.

35:35.426 --> 35:36.803
Sir.

35:36.886 --> 35:39.639
Ward was here, 20th floor.

35:39.722 --> 35:41.599
You two go with Lincoln.
Work your way up.

35:41.682 --> 35:44.185
We'll take the elevator
and work down. Let's go.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.355
So...

35:48.981 --> 35:50.817
Now we wait and see, I guess.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.527
I'm sorry to drag you away.

35:52.610 --> 35:54.570
Looked like you guys
were prepping for a mission.

35:54.654 --> 35:56.739
Long story.

35:56.823 --> 36:01.410
Though Daisy's so confident
in her ability as an Inhuman,

36:01.494 --> 36:03.454
she believes she can change the future.

36:04.914 --> 36:07.750
That's funny.
We're trying to do the same...

37:07.935 --> 37:09.937
Power is intoxicating, isn't it?

37:10.771 --> 37:13.357
And he's right, you never really feel it

37:13.441 --> 37:15.610
until you take someone else's
away from them.

37:22.533 --> 37:24.160
Coulson, come in.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.329
Where are they?

37:26.412 --> 37:28.456
I just had an awful thought.

37:29.749 --> 37:32.084
What if the death Daisy saw
was her own?

37:33.586 --> 37:34.754
<i>Lincoln, do you read?</i>

37:34.837 --> 37:37.590
All units, stop! Do not pursue!

37:37.673 --> 37:39.926
- Lincoln, where are you?
<i>- I have eyes on Ward.</i>

37:42.345 --> 37:45.431
<i>Do not engage.
I repeat, do not engage.</i>

37:46.390 --> 37:49.769
<i>Lincoln, we don't know
what we're dealing with here. Pull out.</i>

38:16.087 --> 38:18.172
Time to say goodbye.

38:59.171 --> 39:01.173
I was sure I could save you.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.680
But you were meant to save me.

39:09.223 --> 39:10.474
I finally...

39:11.809 --> 39:13.227
Made a difference.

39:23.279 --> 39:24.447
It's not snow.

39:26.615 --> 39:28.826
I think we're supposed
to hold hands now.

39:39.628 --> 39:41.839
Maybe some things are inevitable.

39:50.890 --> 39:53.559
I made this for my daughter.

39:54.435 --> 39:57.730
I couldn't bear to leave them,

39:57.813 --> 40:01.025
but I had to protect Robin from this.

40:03.611 --> 40:05.071
You did.

40:05.154 --> 40:08.449
But now I'm afraid
that she could grow up...

40:10.284 --> 40:11.827
To be like me.

40:13.871 --> 40:16.582
So she will always need protection.

40:17.917 --> 40:20.711
I was hoping you could help.

40:23.839 --> 40:24.924
Yes.

40:26.717 --> 40:29.386
I'll protect her, I promise.

40:31.305 --> 40:32.431
Always.

41:00.709 --> 41:02.169
I'm so sorry.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.035
I want you to go there.

41:36.370 --> 41:39.290
Is that where they manufacture
the exo-skeleton hardware?

41:41.125 --> 41:43.961
That's not the technology
we are interested in.

41:52.219 --> 41:53.262
Yes, sir.

41:53.345 --> 41:56.640
I shouldn't have to remind you
that you work for me.

41:56.724 --> 41:57.933
You're the head of my security,

41:58.017 --> 42:01.562
and you should be by my side
at all times, protecting me.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.107
No, sir.

42:05.649 --> 42:07.568
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

42:09.612 --> 42:11.071
Is he all right?

42:11.155 --> 42:12.781
He's fine,

42:13.407 --> 42:16.452
though he sounded a little strange.

42:18.162 --> 42:19.371
Strange how?

42:19.955 --> 42:21.415
<i>He sounded...</i>

42:23.626 --> 42:24.960
<i>Afraid.</i>
