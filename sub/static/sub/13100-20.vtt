WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.208
[dramatic music]

00:07.833 --> 00:10.125
(Garibaldi)
'Indira, Magda,
you're with the Pak'ma'ra.'

00:10.208 --> 00:12.208
Sorry, try not to
drink the water.

00:12.292 --> 00:14.417
Na'karee,
you're gonna be rendezvousing

00:14.500 --> 00:18.167
with the Narn Resistance
in Sector 40. Thanks. Glendora..

00:18.250 --> 00:22.000
(Ivanova)
Commander's personal log,
December 7, 2260.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.250
We're shipping out telepaths
as fast as we can

00:24.333 --> 00:26.792
to the races that have signed
on against the Shadows.

00:26.875 --> 00:28.708
Upon arrival,
they'll be assigned to warships

00:28.792 --> 00:32.000
already on patrol because the
Shadow Vessels are vulnerable

00:32.083 --> 00:34.000
to telepathic interference.

00:34.083 --> 00:36.875
We hope this will even up
the odds a little.

00:36.958 --> 00:38.458
Sheridan's coordinated
the defense

00:38.542 --> 00:41.250
with what's left of the League
of Non-Aligned Worlds.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.625
He hardly ever leaves
the War Room anymore.

00:43.708 --> 00:45.833
He tries not to show it, but..

00:45.917 --> 00:48.125
...you can see the fatigue
in his eyes.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.333
Franklin's still
on walkabout.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.417
No one's seen him
in over a week.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.500
We hope he's alright
and works this through soon.

00:57.583 --> 00:59.417
We're gonna need him
back in Medlab.

01:01.292 --> 01:02.958
Though I don't share
their belief

01:03.042 --> 01:06.333
I'm glad to have Brother Theo
and rest of his monks on board.

01:06.417 --> 01:08.083
Ever since we broke away
from Earth

01:08.167 --> 01:10.625
they've been a wonderful
stabilizing force

01:10.708 --> 01:13.500
working with people
to keep them calm.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.583
How he can be so annoying
one moment

01:15.667 --> 01:19.958
and so comforting
the next is beyond me.

01:20.042 --> 01:25.333
A description which also
applies to someone else I know.

01:25.417 --> 01:27.125
I really don't see
why this is such

01:27.208 --> 01:29.042
a difficult request, commander.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.583
For every telepath you send
to one of the other races

01:31.667 --> 01:34.500
I send along one of my Narns
as bodyguard.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.333
If their tactical value
is as great as we suspect

01:37.417 --> 01:38.708
shouldn't they be protected?

01:38.792 --> 01:40.708
Their safety's already
been guaranteed.

01:40.792 --> 01:42.458
I'm sure that will
be great a comfort

01:42.542 --> 01:44.083
to their grief-stricken families

01:44.167 --> 01:45.708
when a Shadow agent
carves them up

01:45.792 --> 01:47.833
into spare body parts.

01:47.917 --> 01:50.917
With my people around,
this will not happen.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.708
My Narns are willing
to go into great danger

01:53.792 --> 01:56.667
risk sacrificing
themselves for you

01:56.750 --> 02:00.083
knowing that, in turn,
we serve ourselves.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.625
If the symmetry
were any more perfect

02:03.708 --> 02:07.083
I should think one of us
would break into tears.

02:07.167 --> 02:10.875
(Londo)
'I have decided that G'Kar
must be dealt with.'

02:10.958 --> 02:13.583
I suppose so, eventually.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.875
No, not eventually.
As quickly as possible.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.375
Londo, has it
occurred to you that

02:18.458 --> 02:20.333
half the other races are at war?

02:20.417 --> 02:23.167
We have to figure out what to do
about them, about us

02:23.250 --> 02:25.958
and you're worried about G'Kar?

02:26.042 --> 02:28.500
We have a lot bigger
concerns here.

02:28.583 --> 02:31.708
Big concerns grow
from small concerns.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.958
You plant them,
water them with tears

02:34.042 --> 02:35.708
fertilize them with unconcern.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.708
If you ignore them, they grow.

02:37.792 --> 02:40.375
I have ignored this problem
long enough.

02:40.458 --> 02:42.542
Sheridan has given him
sanctuary.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.333
There is nothing
you can do against him

02:44.417 --> 02:45.583
as long as he's here.

02:45.667 --> 02:49.583
Yes, as long as he is here.

02:49.667 --> 02:53.250
So...this, by you, is well done?

02:57.750 --> 02:59.875
Good. So I have found a way

02:59.958 --> 03:03.625
to get him away from here,
and back to Narn.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.750
And once there,
he can be arrested

03:05.833 --> 03:09.083
detained and executed.

03:09.167 --> 03:12.708
And you, Vir,
are going to help me.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.833
[intense music]

03:18.875 --> 03:23.458
(Ivanova)
The Babylon Project was our
last best hope for peace.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.833
It failed.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.500
[theme music]

03:43.625 --> 03:45.333
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:45.417 --> 03:47.750
it became something greater

03:47.833 --> 03:51.083
our last best hope for victory.

03:51.167 --> 03:53.125
[music continues]

03:55.958 --> 04:02.500
The year is 2260.
The place Babylon 5.

04:02.583 --> 04:04.792
[music continues]

04:46.750 --> 04:49.208
[instrumental music]

04:56.542 --> 04:58.208
Good afternoon, commander.

04:58.292 --> 05:02.708
- Oh, Theo. How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.125
Pay no attention to the sound

05:04.208 --> 05:06.250
you'll be hearing
in a few moments.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.375
It's just the grinding
of my teeth

05:08.458 --> 05:10.125
like tectonic plates.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.250
Are you starting in already,
Theo?

05:12.333 --> 05:14.542
'I tell you,
in 50 years of living'

05:14.625 --> 05:16.000
and 40 years of serving the Lord

05:16.083 --> 05:19.042
I have never met a sorrier soul
than Brother Theo here.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.708
- Well, I wouldn't say--
- Oh, thank you.

05:20.792 --> 05:22.458
But I'd prefer
to leave judgments

05:22.542 --> 05:26.667
as to the state of my soul
to someone better qualified

05:26.750 --> 05:28.417
and perhaps a bit less loud.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.042
But it says in the Bible to make
a joyful noise unto the Lord.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.333
I've heard you sing, Will.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.750
And take my word for it

05:35.833 --> 05:38.458
that is not what
the good Lord had in mind

05:38.542 --> 05:40.375
when he said, "A joyful noise."

05:40.458 --> 05:42.792
- Hello?
- Neither is that.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.083
Reverend William A. Dexter

05:44.167 --> 05:46.458
head of the True Gospel Mission
Baptist Church.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.542
- Happy to meet you, commander.
- Nice to meet you.

05:48.625 --> 05:51.958
And these are my associates,
Mr. Chong

05:52.042 --> 05:55.167
Rashid Abdul and Rabbi Meyers.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.833
- It is a pleasure, commander.
- Well, thank you.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.208
Now if you all just follow me,
we've set up

05:59.292 --> 06:00.583
temporary quarters
for each of you.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.083
Temporary?

06:03.167 --> 06:05.375
Nice word, isn't it?

06:05.458 --> 06:06.958
[laughs]

06:10.708 --> 06:12.958
[instrumental music]

06:24.292 --> 06:27.250
[sighs]
Ivanova sent me to find you.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.792
She said you haven't
been sleeping

06:29.875 --> 06:31.625
that you have barely
been eating.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.292
She said that you have been

06:33.375 --> 06:37.417
in her words,
"Carrying on cranky."

06:37.500 --> 06:40.542
I looked up the word cranky,
it said, grouchy.

06:40.625 --> 06:44.292
I looked up grouchy,
it said, crotchety.

06:44.375 --> 06:47.583
No wonder you have
such an eccentric culture.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.250
None of your words
have their own meanings.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.167
You have to look up one
to understand another.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.750
It never ends.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.292
Something here
doesn't make sense.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.625
That is what I thought
when I came across crotchety.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.167
"This cannot be a real word,"
I said.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.667
The Shadows keep attacking
random targets.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.417
Very illogical.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.417
On the other hand,
once engaged

07:07.500 --> 07:09.542
their tactics
are very successful.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.625
Very logical.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.583
I...it's a contradiction.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.333
Unless the random attacks
are logical in some way

07:17.417 --> 07:18.875
we haven't yet determined.

07:18.958 --> 07:20.417
Exactly.

07:20.500 --> 07:24.042
So you have been sitting here
trying to think illogically

07:24.125 --> 07:25.542
about logical possibilities

07:25.625 --> 07:29.792
or logically about
illogical possibilities?

07:29.875 --> 07:32.250
Hm? Uh, yes, yes.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.333
Well, no wonder you are cranky.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.333
Grouchy?

07:38.250 --> 07:39.917
Never mind.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.708
Your face just broke
the language barrier.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.208
Oh..

07:45.292 --> 07:49.167
I'm tired. I haven't had a good
night's sleep since Kosh died.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.667
I'm having
the kind of nightmares

07:50.750 --> 07:52.333
that make
your hair stand on end.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.667
Well, that would explain
the Centauri.

07:56.458 --> 07:59.917
- You need food and rest.
- Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.167
The humans who you've been
waiting for have arrived

08:03.250 --> 08:04.333
and would like to have dinner--

08:04.417 --> 08:05.875
No, no, no, I don't have time.

08:05.958 --> 08:08.750
- If they want to come here--
- So I told them yes.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.375
Delenn.

08:10.458 --> 08:13.750
Since Minbari do not lie
except to save another

08:13.833 --> 08:16.042
my reputation is now at stake.

08:16.125 --> 08:19.875
If you say no,
I will be publicly dishonored.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.667
[sighs]
You don't fight fair.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.292
True.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.250
Dinner is in two standard hours.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.792
I will see you there.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.542
Pain in the butt.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.292
Grouch.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.500
[instrumental music]

08:44.542 --> 08:46.833
Londo, I just heard,
Lord Refa--

08:46.917 --> 08:48.917
Lord Refa is here
with Minister Virini.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.583
Yes, I know.
I am on my way to see them.

08:51.667 --> 08:55.083
- You'll meet me there.
- I'm not going with you?

08:55.167 --> 08:57.250
After you run an errand for me.

08:57.333 --> 09:00.208
You remember G'Kar's aide,
Na'Toth?

09:00.292 --> 09:02.417
Remember?
I still have the claw marks.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.792
They were very close
when she was here.

09:04.875 --> 09:08.375
He lost track of her
when we bombed Narn.

09:08.458 --> 09:11.458
- He assumed she was dead.
- I-is she?

09:11.542 --> 09:13.500
I want you to go to G'Kar

09:13.583 --> 09:16.292
and tell him that
Na'Toth is alive

09:16.375 --> 09:17.750
that she has been taken prisoner

09:17.833 --> 09:19.500
and is being kept in a cell

09:19.583 --> 09:21.625
beneath the building
that once housed

09:21.708 --> 09:23.833
their ruling body, the Kha'Ri.

09:23.917 --> 09:26.375
G'Kar is the last
of the Kha'Ri still free

09:26.458 --> 09:28.208
and the only one
who knows the layout

09:28.292 --> 09:30.667
of these underground cells.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.083
Knowing G'Kar,
once he hears this

09:33.167 --> 09:35.167
he'll return to Narn at once.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.542
But how? You know every ship
going to Narn is searched.

09:38.625 --> 09:41.500
Vir, we're talking
about G'Kar here.

09:41.583 --> 09:44.500
He is annoying,
but extremely capable.

09:44.583 --> 09:47.417
He will find a way,
and when he arrives

09:47.500 --> 09:48.875
he will attempt to free her

09:48.958 --> 09:52.667
and my forces will be there
to arrest him.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.500
No, no, no.
It won't work, Londo.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.958
- He'll never believe me.
- Yes, he will.

09:58.042 --> 10:00.542
He knows you helped his people

10:00.625 --> 10:02.250
when you were stationed
on Minbar.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.167
He trusts you
as much as any of his kind

10:05.250 --> 10:06.958
can trust one of us.

10:07.042 --> 10:10.542
He will believe that you have
no reason to lie to him.

10:10.625 --> 10:14.833
And I don't.
I won't go. I won't do it!

10:14.917 --> 10:17.250
Yes, you will!

10:17.333 --> 10:20.542
You will do it
because I asked you.

10:20.625 --> 10:23.042
Because it will help our people.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.125
Because if you do not

10:25.208 --> 10:28.875
I will reveal everything
you have done on Minbar.

10:28.958 --> 10:32.792
I will humiliate you,
your family and your house.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.833
I will drive them from honor
and bankrupt them.

10:35.917 --> 10:37.958
I will have them stripped naked

10:38.042 --> 10:40.542
and whipped through the streets
of the capital at midday

10:40.625 --> 10:43.667
and in the end,
I will destroy them.

10:45.042 --> 10:49.708
So, yes, you will go,
and you will do it.

10:49.792 --> 10:52.042
[intense music]

10:52.125 --> 10:54.958
I apologize
for the facilities, minister

10:55.042 --> 10:59.208
but it's the best they can
provide on such short notice.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.042
They once asked us
to recognize them, you know.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.625
They seem to think
that if our government

11:03.708 --> 11:06.417
recognized Babylon 5,
they would have an easier time

11:06.500 --> 11:08.583
establishing their independence.

11:10.167 --> 11:15.250
Not much to be independent
about, is there, Lord Refa?

11:15.333 --> 11:17.625
No, Excellency.

11:17.708 --> 11:21.500
Makes one wonder
why Mollari stays.

11:21.583 --> 11:26.500
I think he is no longer suited
for life back home, Excellency.

11:26.583 --> 11:29.417
He has spent too much time
among aliens.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.542
He's out of touch.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.667
You once claimed him
as a valuable ally

11:34.750 --> 11:36.917
sided your house with his.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.042
That was before.
Things change.

11:41.375 --> 11:45.583
And now your house
is in competition with his.

11:47.458 --> 11:51.792
He has had a great influx
of funds to his house, Refa.

11:51.875 --> 11:54.458
With money comes power.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.958
And many have gone over
to his side.

11:57.042 --> 11:59.792
I still have more voices
in the Centaurum

11:59.875 --> 12:03.375
and I have served
the emperor very well.

12:03.458 --> 12:07.917
I would remind His Excellency
that it was I, not Londo

12:08.000 --> 12:11.167
who organized the attack
on the Narn Homeworld.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.250
'I, not Mollari'

12:13.333 --> 12:16.708
who removed
Prime Minister Malachi

12:16.792 --> 12:19.250
and enabled Cartagia
to take the throne.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.333
- 'I--'
- Yes, yes.

12:21.417 --> 12:24.667
And the emperor appreciates
your part in his ascension.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.125
But this division
between two of our oldest

12:27.208 --> 12:29.750
noble houses serves no one.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.167
It must end.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.000
That's why
I wanted you to come

12:34.083 --> 12:38.125
to see for yourself
what Londo has become.

12:38.208 --> 12:43.333
Your word can tilt the balance
if you choose to give it.

12:43.417 --> 12:47.208
[scoffs]
I will give it..

12:47.292 --> 12:49.833
...when I decide which side
is more deserving.

12:49.917 --> 12:52.042
[intense music]

13:10.000 --> 13:12.208
Greetings, Excellency.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.500
I need..

13:25.583 --> 13:27.250
I need to see G'Kar.

13:28.958 --> 13:30.875
I said, I need..

13:33.625 --> 13:35.375
Hello, G'Kar.

13:35.458 --> 13:41.750
I...n-need to talk to you.
I-I...I have some information.

13:41.833 --> 13:46.542
It's...it's about Na'Toth.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.708
[intense music]

14:00.167 --> 14:01.625
Ambassador, this rivalry
between you and Lord Refa

14:01.708 --> 14:04.958
threatens to destabilize
the Royal Court.

14:05.042 --> 14:06.833
'There have been ugly rumors.'

14:06.917 --> 14:08.708
They say you have
tried to poison them

14:08.792 --> 14:10.917
and you say they have
tried the same.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.958
This cannot continue.

14:13.042 --> 14:15.375
I agree, Excellency.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.208
And I am sure Lord Refa
has told you

14:17.292 --> 14:20.083
all the reasons
I am not to be trusted.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.125
I hear many things

14:22.208 --> 14:25.292
but the emperor
has no preference in this.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.292
He merely wants
the matter ended.

14:32.417 --> 14:34.375
Uh, Vir, good.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.708
You did as I asked?

14:39.083 --> 14:41.875
Excellent.

14:41.958 --> 14:44.042
Minister, you're right.

14:44.125 --> 14:46.583
This division must end..

14:46.667 --> 14:50.167
...but by deeds, not words.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.750
What if I could prove
to Emperor Cartagia

14:52.833 --> 14:56.917
the value of House Mollari
over that of House Refa?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.375
What if I could rid
the Royal Court of a problem

15:00.458 --> 15:03.167
that has been bothering it
for quite some time?

15:03.250 --> 15:06.958
An-an embarrassment,
shall we say?

15:07.042 --> 15:10.750
- 'Would that win his favor?'
- Perhaps.

15:10.833 --> 15:12.542
Done.

15:12.625 --> 15:17.292
When I am finished,
this...rivalry

15:17.375 --> 15:20.958
will be over once and for all.

15:21.042 --> 15:23.208
Good day, Excellency.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.667
I don't believe this.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.000
Is that why you're doing this?

15:29.083 --> 15:30.833
To win favor at the Royal Court?

15:30.917 --> 15:32.458
How can you do this to me?

15:32.542 --> 15:34.667
To have G'Kar
imprisoned or killed

15:34.750 --> 15:36.500
just to, to elevate
your position?

15:36.583 --> 15:39.792
You're young, Vir. You don't
understand, but you will.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.708
Gentlemen, I want to
thank you for coming.

15:47.792 --> 15:50.708
With all our ties
with EarthGov cut off

15:50.792 --> 15:54.667
ISN putting out propaganda,
we can't get reliable news

15:54.750 --> 15:56.167
about what's going on on Earth.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.292
Not a problem.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.042
Much as I like to give
Theo here a hard time

16:01.125 --> 16:04.583
the fact is he coordinated
the whole thing.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.375
He said something nice about me.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.875
I must write this down
in my diary.

16:10.875 --> 16:15.208
Before we left,
Rabbi Meyer and the others

16:15.292 --> 16:17.500
gave me their data crystals.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.375
I hid 'em in here.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.083
(Meyer)
'We split the work up
between us'

16:26.167 --> 16:27.958
in order to avoid
drawing suspicion.

16:28.042 --> 16:30.250
Abdul's people intercepted all
governmental transmissions

16:30.333 --> 16:32.042
from the Russian consortium.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.417
Will took the west
and I covered the middle.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.583
England, France, Australia,
Geneva, others.

16:37.667 --> 16:41.458
We also got our hands on most of
the underground transmissions.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.458
So the Resistance
is still alive back home.

16:43.542 --> 16:47.250
[chuckles]
President Clark wants folks
to think otherwise

16:47.333 --> 16:51.333
but...the Resistance
is very much alive.

16:51.417 --> 16:54.708
- It's all there.
- Thanks.

16:54.792 --> 16:56.042
This'll help.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.083
What do they say about us
back home?

16:58.167 --> 17:00.917
That you're
a bunch of renegades.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.042
That you're pirates and traitors

17:03.125 --> 17:05.583
working with aliens
to subvert Earth.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.750
You took a big chance
bringing this to us.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.458
What if they would've been
right about us?

17:10.542 --> 17:12.917
I didn't think so,
but if I was wrong, I was wrong.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.750
I'd rather do something
and make a mistake

17:14.833 --> 17:16.333
than be frightened
into doing nothing.

17:16.417 --> 17:18.250
'That's the problem with them
back home.'

17:18.333 --> 17:20.000
Folks have been conned
into thinking they can't

17:20.083 --> 17:24.250
change the world.
Have to accept what is.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.125
I'll tell you something,
my friends

17:26.208 --> 17:29.375
the world is changing every day.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.875
The only question is,
who's doing it?

17:34.875 --> 17:37.125
Mr. Garibaldi,
may I speak to you for a moment?

17:37.208 --> 17:38.875
Sure, no problem.
What's up?

17:38.958 --> 17:40.792
I am in need of a favor.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.500
Once before after my world fell
to the Centauri

17:43.583 --> 17:45.958
I asked if you could
bring me a message from there.

17:46.042 --> 17:47.500
Yeah, that's right,
we had the Rangers

17:47.583 --> 17:48.958
smuggle it out
on a data crystal.

17:49.042 --> 17:52.333
I now need something
smuggled into my Homeworld.

17:52.417 --> 17:55.333
Okay. How big?

17:55.417 --> 17:59.292
Oh, about this big
and this wide.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.417
- You?
- Me.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.542
G'Kar...there's
a standing warrant

18:04.625 --> 18:06.667
for your arrest back on Narn.

18:06.750 --> 18:10.500
If you go home, you'll be stuck
in prison or shot.

18:10.583 --> 18:13.583
- Nonetheless, I must go.
- Why?

18:13.667 --> 18:16.708
It is a personal matter.

18:16.792 --> 18:19.208
I need a ship
that can slip in quietly

18:19.292 --> 18:21.208
and bring me in
just outside the capital city

18:21.292 --> 18:23.167
and wait a few hours
for my return.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.833
I'll take it from there.

18:24.917 --> 18:29.708
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Nothing worthwhile ever is.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.417
- When?
- Immediately.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.625
[intense music]

18:44.292 --> 18:45.542
[sighs]

18:50.875 --> 18:53.167
[screaming]

18:55.125 --> 18:59.208
(Vir)
Let go of me!
What do you want from me?

18:59.292 --> 19:01.792
'I didn't do anything!'

19:01.875 --> 19:05.875
Correct, Vir, but you are
about to do something.

19:05.958 --> 19:09.000
You are going to tell me
what Londo is planning

19:09.083 --> 19:11.625
or you will not leave
this room alive.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.250
[instrumental music]

19:18.333 --> 19:19.708
I was thinking
about our conversation

19:19.792 --> 19:21.208
earlier this evening.

19:21.292 --> 19:22.833
Now, before I leave,
I would like to hold

19:22.917 --> 19:25.458
an open church meeting,
show the aliens around here

19:25.542 --> 19:28.083
something other than our..
Well..

19:28.167 --> 19:31.500
He seems to think that
if he does not say my name

19:31.583 --> 19:34.042
I will not know
he is referring to me.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.208
I can only assume
someone has been

19:36.292 --> 19:40.208
spray-painting the word idiot
on my back again.

19:40.292 --> 19:42.042
I think it's a great idea.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.417
Uh, we're a little tight
for space right now

19:44.500 --> 19:46.125
but we could use the chapel.

19:46.208 --> 19:50.833
Just tell me it'll be a nice,
quiet, dignified prayer service.

19:50.917 --> 19:54.083
Theo, folks around here
need all the joy they can get

19:54.167 --> 19:56.583
and I intend to give it to them.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.708
Oh, rapture.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.625
[whimpering]

20:04.125 --> 20:05.500
What is Londo doing?

20:07.208 --> 20:09.792
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.625
My sources tell me
he has come up with a way

20:12.708 --> 20:17.667
to elevate his position in
the Royal Court...at my expense.

20:17.750 --> 20:21.125
You know what it is?
'Tell me.'

20:21.208 --> 20:23.750
[gulps]
I can't.

20:23.833 --> 20:28.250
He has not been very kind
to you. Has he, Vir?

20:28.333 --> 20:30.458
He has treated you badly

20:30.542 --> 20:33.875
'thrown you aside,
kept you down.'

20:33.958 --> 20:36.500
I can change that for you.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.250
I can have you appointed
to the Royal Court.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.542
You will be able
to go home again

20:41.625 --> 20:45.208
have money,
a title, a little power.

20:47.958 --> 20:52.542
In time, Vir, I think you
would come to see things my way

20:52.625 --> 20:56.250
but time is something
I do not have.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.708
- Take it from his mind.
- No!

20:59.792 --> 21:02.792
[sobbing]
No. No. No.

21:08.833 --> 21:10.708
I want you to go to G'Kar

21:10.792 --> 21:13.542
and tell him
that Na'Toth is alive.

21:14.875 --> 21:17.625
Knowing G'Kar,
once he hears this

21:17.708 --> 21:20.083
he'll return to Narn at once.

21:22.042 --> 21:25.167
And when he arrives,
he will attempt to save her

21:25.250 --> 21:27.625
and my forces will be there
to arrest him.

21:27.708 --> 21:29.625
[groans]

21:33.458 --> 21:37.958
I know that was uncomfortable,
but it was necessary.

21:38.042 --> 21:40.542
It will also be necessary
to keep you here

21:40.625 --> 21:44.250
until I have finished doing
what needs to be done.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.708
You will be attended to.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.917
[intense music]

22:01.458 --> 22:03.625
[instrumental music]

22:08.833 --> 22:11.500
Oh, sorry,
I saw the lights were out.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.125
'I didn't think
anyone was in here.'

22:13.208 --> 22:16.125
I just couldn't sleep.
Thought I'd do a little walking.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.917
- I can go.
- 'No, no, it's, it's fine.'

22:19.000 --> 22:22.542
Would you like some tea?
I find it helps me sleep.

22:22.625 --> 22:24.958
Just a little. Thanks.

22:25.042 --> 22:27.500
The legs get funny
when you get older.

22:27.583 --> 22:29.250
You're sitting,
they wanna stand.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.083
You stand,
they wanna lay down.

22:31.167 --> 22:33.792
You lay down,
they wanna go for a walk.

22:37.917 --> 22:39.958
'You still working this late?'

22:42.500 --> 22:47.375
Daily reports,
oxygen consumption logs

22:47.458 --> 22:49.667
recycling figures.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.250
It never stops.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.792
Sometimes I think
I stay in the War Room

22:54.875 --> 22:56.208
as much to avoid this stuff

22:56.292 --> 22:58.208
as I do to keep
track of the war.

22:58.292 --> 23:00.500
It's a great responsibility.
Isn't it?

23:00.583 --> 23:01.708
[scoffs]

23:01.792 --> 23:03.292
And, uh..

23:03.375 --> 23:07.667
...who do you share this
great responsibility with?

23:07.750 --> 23:10.667
Well, there's Ivanova,
Garibaldi..

23:10.750 --> 23:15.083
...um, Franklin's
still on walkabout, others.

23:15.167 --> 23:17.125
The work gets spread around.

23:17.208 --> 23:21.875
Now, I didn't say work.
I said, responsibility.

23:21.958 --> 23:23.875
I've watched your people
since I came aboard.

23:23.958 --> 23:26.958
They all come to you with
questions, problems, concerns.

23:27.042 --> 23:30.542
So who do you go to?
Who do you talk to?

23:31.833 --> 23:33.625
Well..

23:33.708 --> 23:36.000
[chuckles]
There isn't anybody.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.542
It's my responsibility.
I-I can't put it on anyone else.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.708
I didn't say you should put it
on anyone else either

23:42.792 --> 23:44.167
just talking about it

23:44.250 --> 23:46.250
'sharing the burden
as much as you can.'

23:46.333 --> 23:49.500
You know, back during the
Minbari War, I was a chaplain.

23:49.583 --> 23:52.667
You could always tell the good
officers from the bad ones.

23:52.750 --> 23:54.208
The bad ones were loaded down

23:54.292 --> 23:56.958
with this sense of
terrible responsibility.

23:57.042 --> 23:58.833
It consumed them.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.750
They wanted to do right
by the men and women

24:00.833 --> 24:02.167
under their command,
but after a while

24:02.250 --> 24:04.583
they just became
more and more isolated

24:04.667 --> 24:08.333
unapproachable,
downright unsociable.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.000
Cranky?

24:11.083 --> 24:13.667
Now, that's as good
a word as any.

24:13.750 --> 24:18.500
They were in such a fog of worry
and self-doubt

24:18.583 --> 24:20.833
that nobody could get through.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.458
When your worry tank gets full,
people stop coming to you

24:23.542 --> 24:26.625
'cause they don't wanna
add to it.

24:26.708 --> 24:29.125
Have to empty out your
worry tank once in a while

24:29.208 --> 24:31.875
or you just get more isolated.

24:31.958 --> 24:33.750
Is that what you think
is happening to me?

24:33.833 --> 24:35.958
'I was just
looking at your eyes'

24:36.042 --> 24:39.667
and remembering that same look
on a lot of the faces I saw

24:39.750 --> 24:42.042
during the last war, that's all.

24:42.125 --> 24:44.167
Oh, and so now
you'd like me to turn

24:44.250 --> 24:46.917
all of this over to God, right?

24:47.000 --> 24:50.458
When God comes knocking
at your door, you won't need me

24:50.542 --> 24:53.792
or anyone else to tell you
what that sound is.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.875
But you gotta remember

24:55.958 --> 25:00.292
after God created man,
he created Eve

25:00.375 --> 25:02.875
because he knew we all need
someone to talk to

25:02.958 --> 25:05.375
someone to help
shoulder the burden.

25:07.542 --> 25:10.167
She loves you, you know.

25:10.250 --> 25:14.708
I saw it in her face at dinner,
every time she looked at you.

25:14.792 --> 25:16.792
I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

25:16.875 --> 25:19.667
Of course. I was just--

25:19.750 --> 25:21.708
Delenn's been
through a lot lately.

25:21.792 --> 25:23.417
We all have.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.083
She's got enough problems
on her hands

25:25.167 --> 25:27.208
without giving her mine as well.

25:27.292 --> 25:29.833
Thank you for your concern,
reverend.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.583
(Will)
'You know, before I got married'

25:34.667 --> 25:35.958
'Emily used
to come by sometimes'

25:36.042 --> 25:37.417
'and help me clean out
my apartment.'

25:37.500 --> 25:39.417
Well, I asked her

25:39.500 --> 25:41.417
"How come you're so eager
to help clean up my place

25:41.500 --> 25:44.125
when your place is just as bad?"
She said..

25:44.208 --> 25:46.792
"Because cleaning up
your place helps me to forget

25:46.875 --> 25:52.208
"what a mess I've made of mine,
and when I sweep my floor

25:52.292 --> 25:54.250
"all I've done
is sweep my floor

25:54.333 --> 25:58.792
"but when I help you
clean up your place

25:58.875 --> 26:00.958
I am helping you."

26:02.792 --> 26:04.292
'Of course,
the way I lived back then'

26:04.375 --> 26:06.500
'sometimes the mess was
too much for both of us'

26:06.583 --> 26:11.708
but...it sure was nice
to have the company.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.833
Goodnight, captain.

26:19.542 --> 26:22.125
[instrumental music]

26:51.125 --> 26:53.333
Hello, G'Kar.

26:53.417 --> 26:56.292
I heard you'd come.
I didn't believe it at first.

26:58.833 --> 27:02.875
Dust in the streets.
The, the wind..

27:04.417 --> 27:06.042
Is it always like this now?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.750
Ever since the bombings.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.542
The wind never stops.

27:12.625 --> 27:14.917
They say it will take years
for all the particulate matter

27:15.000 --> 27:18.917
to drift down out of the sky
and back into the ground.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.542
The days and nights are colder.

27:22.875 --> 27:26.375
It never seems
to feel warm anymore.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.167
- Did you get my message?
- Yes.

27:30.958 --> 27:33.750
What you propose
is dangerous, G'Kar.

27:33.833 --> 27:36.208
What if your information
is wrong?

27:36.292 --> 27:37.583
It isn't.

27:37.667 --> 27:40.208
We will proceed.
Tell the others.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.958
Bring them to me,
and I will show them

27:42.042 --> 27:44.208
how to enter
the underground tunnels.

27:44.292 --> 27:46.375
We will proceed from there.

27:50.583 --> 27:53.125
[wind howling]

27:59.292 --> 28:04.792
Very nice, Drigo, almost
identical to the Royal Palace.

28:04.875 --> 28:07.958
It was, uh,
Minister Virini's idea

28:08.042 --> 28:12.333
as a surprise
for Emperor Cartagia

28:12.417 --> 28:14.208
when he comes to visit.

28:15.875 --> 28:18.125
To make him feel more at home.

28:19.375 --> 28:22.750
If there...is anything
I can do to make--

28:22.833 --> 28:25.167
Yes, there is.

28:31.708 --> 28:37.000
I need six..
No, seven of your best guards.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.625
The last of the Kha'Ri
is coming here.

28:42.708 --> 28:44.458
May even be here already.

28:44.542 --> 28:47.250
'He will probably move tonight.'

28:47.333 --> 28:50.875
When that happens,
I will be there.

28:50.958 --> 28:54.917
The glory for capturing him
will go to my house

28:55.000 --> 28:57.625
and you, good Drigo,
will be compensated

28:57.708 --> 29:00.958
very well for your trouble.

29:01.042 --> 29:02.958
Once we have this Narn..

29:04.125 --> 29:06.208
...what shall we do with him?

29:06.292 --> 29:10.625
Bring him back
to Centauri Prime in chains

29:10.708 --> 29:13.542
as a gift for Emperor Cartagia..

29:13.625 --> 29:16.792
...along with a silver plate

29:16.875 --> 29:21.333
upon which I will have
the head of Londo Mollari.

29:21.417 --> 29:23.333
[laughing]

29:27.333 --> 29:28.708
You're right.

29:28.792 --> 29:30.625
There's no pattern
to the Shadow attacks.

29:30.708 --> 29:32.750
No pattern at all.

29:34.167 --> 29:35.750
I'm sorry.
I wish I could see it.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.292
Yeah, it's okay.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.333
Sometimes..

29:39.417 --> 29:42.125
Sometimes it's just nice
to have the company.

29:44.875 --> 29:47.833
Put the three-dimensional grid
back up again.

29:47.917 --> 29:51.125
Display the attacks in sequence.
Chronological order.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.500
(Sheridan)
'Wait, did you see
what I just saw?'

29:55.583 --> 29:57.375
I think so,
they started here

29:57.458 --> 30:00.125
then jumped across
to this area. Stop.

30:00.208 --> 30:01.958
Display full attack data.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.417
Move the tactical display inward

30:05.500 --> 30:07.208
peeling off the attacks
on the outer areas

30:07.292 --> 30:09.083
and show me the middle
of this sector.

30:14.417 --> 30:16.125
'Stop.'

30:16.208 --> 30:17.750
[Sheridan scoffs]
'Nothing.'

30:17.833 --> 30:20.917
There have been no attacks
in the center of this area.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.792
But they've actually
gone around this part

30:22.875 --> 30:25.458
to attack on the other side.
Why?

30:25.542 --> 30:27.250
Why leave it alone?

30:27.333 --> 30:29.458
The Rangers say
that many refugee ships

30:29.542 --> 30:31.667
fleeing the war have been
heading towards this area

30:31.750 --> 30:34.542
of space because so far
it hasn't been attacked.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.750
It's interesting.

30:36.833 --> 30:39.042
What if they wanted
to drive the refugees

30:39.125 --> 30:41.375
into one area, corral them

30:41.458 --> 30:43.583
make it easier
to hit them all at once?

30:43.667 --> 30:47.917
Could be. The effect would be
devastating, demoralizing.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.208
That could be their intent.

30:50.292 --> 30:52.125
Maybe this is
as much about terror

30:52.208 --> 30:54.125
as it is about territory.

30:54.208 --> 30:55.542
When we've had wars back home

30:55.625 --> 30:58.083
sometimes one side
would leave a-a few areas

30:58.167 --> 31:00.458
of enemy territory undamaged.

31:00.542 --> 31:02.333
That way you'd get
maximum results

31:02.417 --> 31:04.417
when you finally
hit them with something big.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.333
Hiroshima, Nagasaki,
Dresden, San Diego.

31:07.417 --> 31:09.083
They could be doing
the same thing here

31:09.167 --> 31:11.833
drawing in thousands
of ships, escorts, and refugees

31:11.917 --> 31:13.458
from a dozen worlds
in preparation

31:13.542 --> 31:14.833
for a major offensive.

31:14.917 --> 31:17.708
It makes sense.
It's what I'd do.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.625
What?

31:19.708 --> 31:21.292
Well.. You know..

31:21.375 --> 31:24.792
If I were the bad guys.
I were them.

31:24.875 --> 31:27.083
The only way we're going to beat
them is to think like them.

31:27.167 --> 31:28.792
- Think like them?
- Yes.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.083
No. You will come with me.

31:31.167 --> 31:33.000
Well, no, no, wait.
We, we just figured this out.

31:33.083 --> 31:35.333
Reverend Dexter says you need
some time away from this.

31:35.417 --> 31:36.833
Right now I agree.

31:36.917 --> 31:41.292
Well, Delenn, the battles,
the war, they need me here.

31:41.375 --> 31:43.125
Today the Shadows,
tomorrow the galaxy..

31:43.208 --> 31:45.250
Yes, John.
Of course, John.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.750
- Whatever you say, John.
- Delenn, listen..

31:49.417 --> 31:52.000
[instrumental music]

32:00.083 --> 32:01.625
We are ready to proceed, G'kar.

32:01.708 --> 32:04.000
- They understand the target?
- They do.

32:04.083 --> 32:05.917
Then follow me.
I know the way.

32:07.792 --> 32:09.750
[door beeps]

32:17.125 --> 32:18.708
[groaning]

32:20.375 --> 32:23.917
Aah. I sometimes think
they choose guards

32:24.000 --> 32:27.458
for the amount of bone content
in their heads.

32:27.542 --> 32:29.542
Might as well hire Minbaris.

32:30.625 --> 32:33.583
- You alright, Vir?
- Yes.

32:33.667 --> 32:35.583
But there's been a problem.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.542
[dramatic music]

33:14.917 --> 33:17.625
That's far enough, G'kar.

33:17.708 --> 33:22.375
You have just taken
your final step as a free Narn.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.417
[laughing]

33:24.500 --> 33:29.833
Every day, here and at home,
we are warned about the enemy.

33:29.917 --> 33:33.333
But who is the enemy?

33:33.417 --> 33:35.750
'Is it the alien? Well..'

33:35.833 --> 33:39.250
'We are all alien
to one another.'

33:39.333 --> 33:43.208
'Is it the one who believes
differently than we do?'

33:43.292 --> 33:48.750
No. Oh, no, my friends.
The enemy is fear.

33:48.833 --> 33:51.542
The enemy is ignorance.

33:51.625 --> 33:53.958
The enemy is the one
who tells you

33:54.042 --> 33:56.958
that you must hate
that which is different

33:57.042 --> 34:01.375
because in the end,
that hate will turn on you

34:01.458 --> 34:06.000
and that same hate
will destroy you.

34:06.083 --> 34:08.208
G'kar, I want alive.

34:08.292 --> 34:11.583
The rest, do as you wish.

34:14.875 --> 34:17.000
Go on. What are you waiting for?

34:18.542 --> 34:20.167
This.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.958
Hello, Refa.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.917
If you are seeing
this message

34:29.000 --> 34:33.958
it is because in a very
few minutes you will be dead.

34:34.042 --> 34:37.792
I have made sure
the guards assigned to you

34:37.875 --> 34:40.792
are loyal to House Mollari.

34:40.875 --> 34:44.875
They will not obey you
from this moment forward.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.333
You have taken from me..

34:49.250 --> 34:51.875
...that which I loved, Refa.

34:53.417 --> 34:57.167
You also took the life
of Prime Minister Malachi

34:57.250 --> 34:58.833
a good and dear friend.

34:58.917 --> 35:00.833
You have inconvenienced me

35:00.917 --> 35:03.708
and threatened my position
in the Royal Court

35:03.792 --> 35:07.792
and weakened our defenses
by your constant warfare..

35:09.750 --> 35:14.333
...none of which matters
to G'kar or his associates.

35:15.750 --> 35:18.333
But I think they do care

35:18.417 --> 35:22.458
about what you have done
to them, Refa.

35:22.542 --> 35:25.875
Yes, I think they care
about that a great deal.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.417
All, please rise.

35:32.125 --> 35:37.250
I have given G'kar documents,
which prove that you are the one

35:37.333 --> 35:39.542
who orchestrated the bombing
of the Narn Homeworld

35:39.625 --> 35:41.333
against my advice.

35:41.417 --> 35:43.792
That you personally
were involved

35:43.875 --> 35:48.833
in the creation of death camps
and genetic cleansing programs.

35:52.875 --> 35:57.208
That you are personally
responsible for the death

35:57.292 --> 36:02.375
of five or six million Narns.

36:03.917 --> 36:06.500
And I think they would
like to thank you

36:06.583 --> 36:09.917
personally for your efforts.

36:11.708 --> 36:14.833
You can't believe him.
He's lying.

36:14.917 --> 36:18.667
On the off chance
that G'kar might not believe me

36:18.750 --> 36:22.750
I have arranged for 2000 Narns

36:22.833 --> 36:25.542
now in custody to be freed.

36:26.917 --> 36:30.042
Half in advance,
half pending his cooperation.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.958
More than sufficient inducement,
I think.

36:37.417 --> 36:39.292
You see..

36:39.375 --> 36:42.125
...it is not enough for me to..

36:43.500 --> 36:46.458
...simply kill you, Refa.

36:47.750 --> 36:50.083
I could do that
at home or here..

36:52.292 --> 36:55.208
...but through
your death on Narn

36:55.292 --> 36:58.500
I will discredit your house..

36:58.583 --> 37:01.583
...and all opposition
in the Royal Court.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.417
Goodbye, Refa.

37:15.042 --> 37:16.208
No.

37:17.417 --> 37:19.167
No, this is a mistake.

37:19.250 --> 37:21.208
Come back!

37:23.708 --> 37:26.625
Make sure this is found
on his body.

37:28.708 --> 37:31.000
Leave his face and head intact.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.917
They will be needed later
for identification.

37:37.625 --> 37:40.000

39:07.500 --> 39:12.042
And this data crystal
was found on Lord Refa's body.

39:12.125 --> 39:14.708
It contains information
that would be very useful

39:14.792 --> 39:17.667
to the Narn Resistance.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.417
He thought he could bargain
with the Narns.

39:20.500 --> 39:24.833
As the humans say, "Play both
sides against the middle."

39:24.917 --> 39:28.250
From what was left
of his body when he was found

39:28.333 --> 39:30.417
he was quite wrong.

39:30.500 --> 39:34.000
Refa, a traitor?
I can't imagine it.

39:35.417 --> 39:38.833
His loyalties were never
to anyone but himself.

39:38.917 --> 39:40.917
By helping the Narn Resistance

39:41.000 --> 39:43.375
encouraging acts of terror
against our people

39:43.458 --> 39:46.083
he hoped to undermine
the Royal Court

39:46.167 --> 39:47.792
create enough public outrage

39:47.875 --> 39:49.833
that he could
move his own people

39:49.917 --> 39:51.750
into positions of power.

39:51.833 --> 39:55.958
And where they go...he would not
be far behind.

39:56.042 --> 39:57.667
From what is here

39:57.750 --> 40:01.125
I suspect he was also
planning to kill you

40:01.208 --> 40:03.458
'just as he did
Prime Minister Malachi.'

40:03.542 --> 40:05.333
Apparently, he felt that

40:05.417 --> 40:08.125
you were getting
in the way of his plans.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.792
Yes, he seemed quite upset

40:09.875 --> 40:12.042
that I was questioning
his authority.

40:13.417 --> 40:16.042
I had no idea
he would go so far.

40:16.125 --> 40:18.000
He wanted power.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.958
It's what I said from the start.

40:21.042 --> 40:25.458
Sooner or later,
it would destroy him or us.

40:27.083 --> 40:29.333
Better it was him.

40:31.208 --> 40:35.625
Well, thank you for bringing
this to my attention, Mollari.

40:35.708 --> 40:40.042
I'm sure Emperor Cartagia
will be most grateful..

40:40.125 --> 40:41.875
...for your assistance.

40:43.208 --> 40:46.417
I live only to serve.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.000
Good day, Excellency.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.875
Alright, Vir, what is it?
You have that look again.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.958
- You used me.
- Of course.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.542
I knew Refa
had a telepath with him.

41:04.625 --> 41:07.042
If I told you the truth,
he would've found out

41:07.125 --> 41:09.917
so I let you believe
what I wanted him to believe.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.917
It was the only way to lure him
into the trap I had set for him.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.667
Londo,
they could have killed me.

41:14.750 --> 41:17.250
Nonsense. You're not important
enough to kill.

41:17.333 --> 41:20.792
But I'm important enough
for you to lie to.

41:20.875 --> 41:23.250
I used to think
I knew you, Londo

41:23.333 --> 41:25.667
but I never knew you at all,
did I?

41:31.583 --> 41:34.542
(Sheridan)
'I wish you would tell me what
this is all about, Delenn.'

41:34.625 --> 41:36.875
It's a surprise.

41:36.958 --> 41:38.750
Now that we know what
the Shadows have in mind

41:38.833 --> 41:41.208
we have an advantage
for the first time.

41:41.292 --> 41:42.708
We can rally
all the other races

41:42.792 --> 41:46.000
prepare to launch
a major counter-attack.

41:46.083 --> 41:48.875
I thought you might like
to know what resources you have.

41:50.458 --> 41:52.083
Dabi.

41:57.833 --> 41:59.833
Take a look.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.792

42:02.875 --> 42:04.792
Oh, my..

42:04.875 --> 42:08.417
(Delenn)
'The White Star was never
intended to be one of a kind.'

42:08.500 --> 42:10.750
'It was only the first.'

42:10.833 --> 42:13.750
'We've been working around
the clock to construct them.'

42:13.833 --> 42:15.917
I said we needed
time to prepare.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.833
This is why.

42:17.917 --> 42:20.917
The first wave of ships
is finished at last.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.083
The Rangers will pilot them
under our shared command.

42:24.167 --> 42:27.167
We are as ready for them
as we will ever be.

42:27.250 --> 42:31.333
We finally have,
as you say, a fighting chance.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.458
I don't know what to say.

42:41.667 --> 42:43.542
Then say nothing.
