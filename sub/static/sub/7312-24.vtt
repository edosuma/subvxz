WEBVTT

00:02.913 --> 00:05.521
Called the Port-to-Port Killer.
M.O.'s the same every time.

00:05.565 --> 00:07.391
My killer, my case.

00:07.434 --> 00:08.478
This is for you.

00:08.521 --> 00:09.956
I didn't order that.

00:11.652 --> 00:12.913
No, you do it.

00:16.043 --> 00:19.391
Your eyeball,
how come it opens up
restricted areas at NCIS?

00:19.434 --> 00:22.347
Port-to-Port Killer-- as you've
dubbed him-- has a name.

00:22.391 --> 00:24.652
Lieutenant Jonas Cobb.

00:25.913 --> 00:28.217
[gunshots]

00:30.826 --> 00:32.217
[groans]

00:34.739 --> 00:37.130
Oh, Mike.

00:39.434 --> 00:41.130
VANCE:
Be on high alert.

00:41.173 --> 00:44.000
Cobb is armed and likely
anticipates your arrival.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.521
[gunshots, gasping]

00:50.304 --> 00:52.173
[strained groaning]

01:36.217 --> 01:37.782
[grunts]

01:37.826 --> 01:39.130
Ah, man...

01:39.173 --> 01:40.434
I got it, Cade.
Lie still.

01:43.608 --> 01:44.304
Levin.

01:53.913 --> 01:54.782
Where's EJ?

01:54.826 --> 01:56.217
Cobb took her.

01:56.260 --> 01:58.652
DiNozzo, come back here.
Stay with him.

02:00.173 --> 02:01.956
Keep pressure on it.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.739
I got it.

02:03.782 --> 02:05.304
Just hang in there.

02:05.347 --> 02:07.521
You're gonna be all right.

02:16.913 --> 02:19.652
[distant sirens wailing]

02:23.304 --> 02:25.391
[helicopter hovering]

02:56.956 --> 02:59.347
[muffled whimpering]

03:35.086 --> 03:36.043
Drink this.

03:38.608 --> 03:41.652
Boss, I adjusted
the BOLO on the P2P

03:41.695 --> 03:43.695
based on Agent Barrett's
latest description.

03:43.739 --> 03:45.347
Get an update on Cade?

03:45.391 --> 03:46.478
ZIVA:
He's in surgery.

03:46.521 --> 03:48.086
Abby's at the
hospital, waiting.

03:48.130 --> 03:50.043
Levin's next-of-kin.

03:50.086 --> 03:52.826
Agents from the
Great Lakes field
office are with his

03:52.869 --> 03:54.608
family in Chicago.Ducky and Palmer are

03:54.652 --> 03:56.782
on their way up
with the remains now.

03:56.826 --> 03:59.391
McGEE:
I ran the phone number that Cobb
keyed into the sedan.

03:59.434 --> 04:00.956
I.D.'s blocked.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.565
It's a secure government line.

04:03.608 --> 04:05.565
GIBBS:
Well, unsecure it, McGee.

04:05.608 --> 04:06.913
Whoever it
belongs to has

04:06.956 --> 04:08.260
a significant clearance level.

04:08.304 --> 04:10.347
I'm having trouble cracking it.

04:10.391 --> 04:12.826
That's Ray's cell phone number.

04:12.869 --> 04:14.043
Where is he?

04:14.086 --> 04:16.913
I'm not sure.
We have not spoken.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.043
Well, find him. Warn him.
Tell him to protect his ass.

04:43.695 --> 04:45.086
[groans]

04:46.739 --> 04:48.434
KORT:
Cobb became a monster.

05:03.826 --> 05:04.782
[intercom clicks]

05:04.826 --> 05:05.782
SECRETARY:
Yes, Director?

05:05.826 --> 05:07.695
Get me SECNAV.Right away, sir.

05:15.434 --> 05:18.000
He used a marker
instead of a blade.

05:18.043 --> 05:19.913
It'll come off.

05:19.956 --> 05:21.304
[grunts]

05:23.608 --> 05:24.956
Come on. You're
gonna hurt yourself.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.565
[gasps]

05:27.608 --> 05:29.391
Why didn't he kill me?

05:29.434 --> 05:30.478
I fought like hell.

05:30.521 --> 05:32.521
But why didn't he do it
right there?

05:32.565 --> 05:36.347
You were a message,
not a victim.

05:36.391 --> 05:39.043
Consider
yourself lucky.

05:39.086 --> 05:41.565
Levin's dead.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.608
Cade may not make it.

05:43.652 --> 05:44.956
They were my responsibility.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.652
Where exactly is
the luck in that?

05:46.695 --> 05:49.391
You think Gibbs would have
let Cobb leave Europe?

05:49.434 --> 05:51.478
You think any of this would have
happened

05:51.521 --> 05:53.869
if anybody else had been
leading the case?

05:53.913 --> 05:55.478
Stop beating yourself up.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.130
We've all lost
people in the field.

05:58.173 --> 06:00.478
You're a good agent.Am I?

06:00.521 --> 06:03.391
You're letting Cobb get
inside your head, EJ,

06:03.434 --> 06:06.347
and that's exactly what he
wants. You gotta stop.

06:06.391 --> 06:08.782
Tony, he's not doing this
'cause he wants to.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.782
Cobb's doing this because
he has to.

06:15.695 --> 06:17.304
[faucet running]

06:36.608 --> 06:38.086
Okay, Duck.

06:38.130 --> 06:41.608
Based on Agent Barrett's
detailed description of the gun

06:41.652 --> 06:43.913
and the shell casings
retrieved at the scene,

06:43.956 --> 06:48.608
Cobb was almost certainly
using Mike Franks' sidearm.

06:50.521 --> 06:51.869
Precision shot.

06:51.913 --> 06:54.739
The Port-to-Port Killer is
proving as accomplished

06:54.782 --> 06:57.043
with a gun as he is
with a surgical blade.

06:57.086 --> 06:58.869
Why the change in method?

06:58.913 --> 07:00.260
'Cause it's no longer
about method

07:00.304 --> 07:02.434
or clue trail or
gamesmanship, Mr. Palmer.

07:02.478 --> 07:05.782
It's about hurting those
responsible

07:05.826 --> 07:07.521
for putting him in
this situation.

07:07.565 --> 07:09.260
Situation?

07:09.304 --> 07:10.826
Operation Frankenstein.

07:10.869 --> 07:13.217
Set aside your
preconceived notions

07:13.260 --> 07:14.739
about what drives
a serial killer.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.043
What was once about
profiling Cobb,

07:17.086 --> 07:19.000
his training
as a medic--

07:19.043 --> 07:22.913
his mastery of the scalpel, his
dressing his younger victims

07:22.956 --> 07:25.739
as older officers--
all that has evolved

07:25.782 --> 07:28.869
into clearheaded self-awareness.

07:28.913 --> 07:32.000
Those who created him
must now pay.

07:35.086 --> 07:36.782
Hi.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.695
Oh, Agent Barrett.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Please, come in.

07:45.260 --> 07:46.782
I didn't mean to interrupt.

07:46.826 --> 07:48.217
I just keep thinking
about Levin.

07:50.086 --> 07:53.130
GIBBS: You want someone
to drive you home, Barrett?

07:53.173 --> 07:55.043
Maybe you can get some rest.

07:55.086 --> 07:58.217
I'm fine, really. I...

07:58.260 --> 08:00.478
But before Dr. Mallard begins
the autopsy,

08:00.521 --> 08:03.478
I'd like a moment
to pay my respects.

08:03.521 --> 08:04.478
DUCKY:
Mr. Palmer.

08:12.565 --> 08:14.304
[door whooshes closed]

08:33.217 --> 08:35.434
â™ª

08:55.173 --> 08:56.521
[switchblade clicks]

09:31.608 --> 09:33.130
I've tried everything.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.304
Ray's not answering.

09:35.347 --> 09:37.652
Did you talk to his boss?He said he was working

09:37.695 --> 09:39.652
and the assignment is
classified.Well, they must

09:39.695 --> 09:41.217
be able to get in
touch with him.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.521
I don't like this.

09:42.565 --> 09:45.826
I mean, Cobb knows
that Ray is on this case.

09:45.869 --> 09:48.956
He blames the Navy and the CIA
for what has happened.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.956
I blame the one-eyed tea bag.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.608
He's the one
who screwed this up.

09:55.608 --> 09:57.000
I'm worried.

09:58.521 --> 09:59.695
We'll find him.

10:21.217 --> 10:23.478
Good morning,
Mr. Secretary.

10:23.521 --> 10:24.739
Like hell it is, Leon.

10:24.782 --> 10:27.086
This better be
damn important.

10:27.130 --> 10:30.826
Agent's dead, Mr. Secretary.
Another critical.

10:30.869 --> 10:32.695
I don't know how much more
important it could get.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.521
Right this way, sir.

10:47.826 --> 10:50.260
McGee, what are
you doing here?

10:50.304 --> 10:53.000
Waiting for you. How's Cade?

10:56.086 --> 10:58.565
Stable, sort of.

10:58.608 --> 11:01.000
I mean, he's lost
a lot of blood.

11:01.043 --> 11:02.130
Well, he's a big guy.

11:02.173 --> 11:03.130
He's got a lot
of blood to lose.

11:04.695 --> 11:06.347
Did you stay
with him all night?

11:07.782 --> 11:10.608
He's a friend, McGee.

11:10.652 --> 11:13.652
I would do that
for any friend.

11:13.695 --> 11:15.434
For you or for Tony,
for Gibbs.

11:15.478 --> 11:17.695
I know you would.
And listen, it's okay

11:17.739 --> 11:20.130
if you two are
more than friends.

11:20.173 --> 11:21.695
I understand, seriously.

11:21.739 --> 11:24.086
I really like Cade,

11:24.130 --> 11:28.000
and I can understand how
a man of his stature
could be intriguing

11:28.043 --> 11:29.565
to a woman...

11:29.608 --> 11:31.869
Are you for real
right now, McGee?

11:31.913 --> 11:33.521
Really?

11:33.565 --> 11:38.000
Because I am, like,
over the top tired

11:38.043 --> 11:39.826
and I'm hoping this
is all some sort

11:39.869 --> 11:42.173
of weird dream.

11:42.217 --> 11:43.521
I'm not a dream.

11:43.565 --> 11:46.260
Well, that's too bad
because right now

11:46.304 --> 11:47.782
I'd like to just roll over

11:47.826 --> 11:53.173
and dream about purple kittens
or-or flying elephants or...

11:53.217 --> 11:56.782
just... Never mind.

11:56.826 --> 11:58.565
I need to go home.

12:03.913 --> 12:06.739
Where are you going?

12:06.782 --> 12:08.478
Going with you. As long as Cobb
is still on the loose,

12:08.521 --> 12:10.217
we're not taking
any chances.

12:10.260 --> 12:14.521
No, McGee, shoo.
I can take care of myself.

12:14.565 --> 12:16.695
Abby, this is not just
another random suspect.

12:16.739 --> 12:19.347
This guy is very bad news.

12:19.391 --> 12:20.913
And if something ever
happened to you, I would...

12:23.869 --> 12:24.956
You'd what, McGee?

12:52.913 --> 12:55.000
I know what it's like
to lose a team member.

12:55.043 --> 12:58.913
Especially one you
care deeply for.

13:01.913 --> 13:04.869
You learn there is no
rhyme or reason to dying.

13:04.913 --> 13:07.695
Good or bad, it's just
completely out of your hands.

13:07.739 --> 13:10.869
Agent Levin died
because I screwed up.

13:10.913 --> 13:13.478
No, Agent Levin died
because it was his time.

13:13.521 --> 13:15.869
There was nothing
you could do about it.

13:15.913 --> 13:18.608
[cell phone rings]Excuse me.

13:18.652 --> 13:19.652
David.

13:19.695 --> 13:22.913
It's Tony.Yes, Tony. Where?

13:22.956 --> 13:25.391
Can you please send it over?

13:25.434 --> 13:28.347
No, I'm not going
to wait for you.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.565
Ray is apparently
at a hotel in D.C.

13:30.608 --> 13:32.086
Kort gave us the address.

13:32.130 --> 13:33.173
I'll come with you.

13:33.217 --> 13:34.739
That's not a good idea.

13:34.782 --> 13:36.695
I could use the fresh air.

13:36.739 --> 13:39.043
EJ, I'm going to see
my boyfriend.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.000
Can you please tell McGee

13:41.043 --> 13:43.956
that Agent Cruz will
not be needing the
safe house after all.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
He will be staying
with me instead.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.347
Ray, it's me. Open up.

13:59.913 --> 14:02.000
Ray, come on, we need to talk.

14:04.434 --> 14:05.652
I was beginning to think
you didn't...

14:05.695 --> 14:06.434
[groans]

14:11.826 --> 14:13.608
[moans weakly]

14:26.956 --> 14:31.000
Look, Leon, I'm as
unhappy about what's
happened as you are.

14:31.043 --> 14:32.869
But you can manage this.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.260
Can I?
Damn right.

14:35.304 --> 14:37.608
How many years we been
doing this together?

14:37.652 --> 14:39.565
Too long.Before you, Jenny had

14:39.608 --> 14:42.347
to clean up messes
a lot worse than this one.

14:42.391 --> 14:45.347
Director Shepard had
her share of problems, sir,

14:45.391 --> 14:47.608
but one thing has nothing
to do with the other.

14:47.652 --> 14:50.652
My point is it comes
with the territory.

14:50.695 --> 14:54.695
Now if you're reaching
your saturation level,

14:54.739 --> 14:59.173
well, that's
a bigger conversation.

14:59.217 --> 15:01.130
This isn't just
about me, sir.

15:01.173 --> 15:04.000
Then what are we
talking about?

15:04.043 --> 15:07.695
Mr. Secretary,
year after year

15:07.739 --> 15:09.782
I've caught whatever
was thrown my way.

15:09.826 --> 15:13.608
But since Eli David was here,
since I got hurt,

15:13.652 --> 15:15.434
things have been different.

15:15.478 --> 15:16.695
Different how?

15:16.739 --> 15:18.695
You need time, Leon?

15:18.739 --> 15:21.391
For God's sake, take all
the time you need.

15:21.434 --> 15:24.521
I'm not talking about time, sir,
I'm talking about mistakes.

15:24.565 --> 15:27.391
Now you learn to accept
a lot with this job.

15:27.434 --> 15:30.391
Resolutions that I knew
were wrong.

15:30.434 --> 15:32.043
And now we're facing
the consequences.

15:44.434 --> 15:46.043
We can't talk
about this here.

15:46.086 --> 15:47.347
You know that.

15:47.391 --> 15:50.869
We need a SCIF. It's a black op.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.130
[beeping, whirring]

15:59.304 --> 16:01.478
Modifications
were made, sir.

16:01.521 --> 16:05.478
We can talk all we want.
The room's tight as a drum.

16:39.391 --> 16:41.347
FRANKS: "Too many years of lightin' up

16:41.391 --> 16:45.478
"finally caught up
with me, probie.

16:45.521 --> 16:50.043
"For three decades I outran
every bullet aimed at me.

16:50.086 --> 16:52.086
"Can't outrun this.

16:52.130 --> 16:54.608
"Not with these lungs.

16:54.652 --> 16:58.434
Only got a few months left to
go, and I plan to live 'em."

17:01.478 --> 17:05.043
Never one to disappoint,
were you, Mike?

17:05.086 --> 17:07.130
[cell phone rings]

17:09.913 --> 17:11.652
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

17:11.695 --> 17:14.739
Boss, it's me...DiNozzo, slow down.

17:18.913 --> 17:21.086
DiNozzo, talk to me.

17:21.130 --> 17:23.217
Ziva went
to find Ray.

17:23.260 --> 17:25.521
I got a 20 on Cruz
from Agent Eye-patch.

17:25.565 --> 17:27.608
Well, he should know.That's what I thought.

17:27.652 --> 17:28.913
Location?

17:28.956 --> 17:30.391
Northrop Hotel, 27th and M.

17:30.434 --> 17:32.521
She went there to bring
Ray back to her place.

17:32.565 --> 17:34.217
Thought it would
be safer.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.347
Is there a problem?The problem is, I
haven't checked in yet.

17:36.391 --> 17:39.521
I was on assignment. I just got
back to D.C. an hour ago.

17:39.565 --> 17:41.086
Where is Ziva?I really don't know, sir.

17:41.130 --> 17:42.043
TONY:
Can't find her.

17:42.086 --> 17:43.739
Tried her home and cell.

17:43.782 --> 17:45.695
I knew I shouldn't have
let her go alone.

17:45.739 --> 17:48.086
This is not your responsibility.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.869
Kort lied.No, he didn't.

17:49.913 --> 17:51.869
His information
was accurate.

17:51.913 --> 17:53.347
Who else had access to your
travel plans, Cruz?

17:53.391 --> 17:55.956
My itinerary's classified, sir.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.478
Classified never stopped
Cobb before.

17:57.521 --> 17:58.956
What if he
got there first?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.260
DiNozzo, BOLO
out on Ziva.

18:00.304 --> 18:01.739
McGee, get me Kort.

18:01.782 --> 18:03.304
Boss, he's already
in the building.

18:07.956 --> 18:11.521
It's been a long time,
Mr. Secretary.

18:11.565 --> 18:15.086
We weren't supposed
to see each other again.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.608
Per your request.

18:16.652 --> 18:19.608
I certainly wish
that were the case.

18:19.652 --> 18:21.913
Oh, Leon, do we have to
talk about this again?

18:21.956 --> 18:24.521
Am I boring you, Kort?

18:24.565 --> 18:26.652
You know I have a
limited attention span.

18:26.695 --> 18:31.130
Well, let me see if I can
keep it interesting for you.

18:31.173 --> 18:34.434
Here's what your boy Cobb
just did to one of my men.

18:34.478 --> 18:36.434
I trained him
to kill, Director.

18:36.478 --> 18:38.130
Selection is entirely
his decision.

18:38.173 --> 18:39.478
Do you remember

18:39.521 --> 18:41.000
when this operation
was conceived?

18:41.043 --> 18:43.391
Like it was yesterday.

18:43.434 --> 18:46.086
Your clever notion,
I believe.

18:46.130 --> 18:48.217
Scribbled on a note pad

18:48.260 --> 18:50.521
during your days
at the war college.

18:50.565 --> 18:51.521
Who knew

18:51.565 --> 18:54.043
it would become
a joint venture

18:54.086 --> 18:55.956
between the Navy
and the CIA?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.347
It was flawed from the get-go.
It should have been aborted.

18:58.391 --> 18:59.565
It was conceptually brilliant.

18:59.608 --> 19:02.869
The results were
generally positive.

19:02.913 --> 19:05.478
Except Kort lost control
of one of his men.

19:05.521 --> 19:06.826
It wasn't from
lack of trying.

19:06.869 --> 19:09.565
Cobb was strong-willed.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.478
Got a taste for killing.

19:11.521 --> 19:13.173
You pushed him.

19:13.217 --> 19:15.695
You used him on assignments
outside of the program.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.043
With approval.

19:17.086 --> 19:19.000
Those who
needed to know

19:19.043 --> 19:20.304
did.

19:20.347 --> 19:22.652
And now somebody has
to take the heat.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.173
Special Agents Barrett and Gibbs
have failed to stop him.

19:25.217 --> 19:26.608
You can't blame them.

19:26.652 --> 19:29.956
Mr. Secretary,

19:30.000 --> 19:31.521
for once the weight

19:31.565 --> 19:34.565
does not fall on the bottom
of the pyramid.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.869
This operation
was your call.

19:36.913 --> 19:37.782
Accept it.

19:41.086 --> 19:44.000
Pam, is he in here?

19:44.043 --> 19:45.739
Sir, we're in SCIF mode.
You don't have clearance.

19:45.782 --> 19:48.130
[alarm beeping]

19:48.173 --> 19:49.304
Excuse me.

19:52.695 --> 19:54.086
Leon.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.608
We need to talk.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.956
Not now, Gibbs.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.695
Is Trent Kort in there with you?

19:58.739 --> 20:03.956
Agent Gibbs, this meeting
requires access beyond
your need to know.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.826
I need to know if he sent one
of my people into a trap.

20:06.869 --> 20:08.521
Ziva went to meet Ray Cruz

20:08.565 --> 20:10.043
at his hotel,
and he wasn't there yet.

20:10.086 --> 20:11.956
And now she's missing.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.521
Gibbs, all I did was provide
your team with Cruz's location.

20:15.565 --> 20:17.391
Well, we think Cobb got her.

20:17.434 --> 20:18.956
You think I sent her
in there on purpose?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.869
To gain what, exactly?

20:20.913 --> 20:22.130
If she gets hurt,

20:22.173 --> 20:24.608
you answer to me.

20:26.086 --> 20:28.826
Is he threatening me, Director?

20:28.869 --> 20:30.347
If he wasn't,

20:30.391 --> 20:32.260
I am.

20:34.565 --> 20:36.782
What do you mean the security
camera's not working?

20:36.826 --> 20:39.260
I told you, Tony, the system's
down all over the hotel.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.086
It has been for days.Isn't that illegal?

20:41.130 --> 20:43.043
Same M.O. No fingerprints.

20:43.086 --> 20:44.695
The place has been
wiped clean.

20:44.739 --> 20:48.173
How could she just walk out
of here and nobody notices?

20:48.217 --> 20:50.173
Tony.

20:50.217 --> 20:52.086
Sorry.

20:52.130 --> 20:53.739
We're all worried
about Ziva.

20:53.782 --> 20:55.521
I know.

20:55.565 --> 20:58.173
It's just different
for some of us.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.434
[knocking]

21:04.521 --> 21:06.478
I think you people
are looking for me.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.304
BARRETT:
This isn't right.

21:36.347 --> 21:37.608
It's too easy.

21:37.652 --> 21:40.130
He knows where Ziva is.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.521
There's nothing
easy about it.

21:41.565 --> 21:43.695
Cobb's playing us.

21:43.739 --> 21:46.304
Playing Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.000
Guy must have
a death wish.

21:48.043 --> 21:50.043
What does he want?

21:50.086 --> 21:51.304
Rule 16:

21:51.347 --> 21:52.956
If someone thinks they
have the upper hand,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.565
break it.

21:55.608 --> 21:57.826
[door opens]

21:57.869 --> 21:58.826
[door closes]

22:12.521 --> 22:14.478
[chuckles]

22:14.521 --> 22:17.478
Something funny?

22:17.521 --> 22:19.565
I mean, you're so confident.

22:19.608 --> 22:21.000
So proud.

22:21.043 --> 22:24.434
Nothing to be proud of.
You gave yourself up.

22:24.478 --> 22:27.304
Why?

22:27.347 --> 22:29.869
Well, because most
of my work is done.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.913
Most?

22:31.956 --> 22:34.913
Agent Gibbs, are you incapable
of savoring a moment?

22:34.956 --> 22:38.565
Nothing to savor. Yet.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.652
One of my team
is still missing.

22:43.826 --> 22:45.695
Where is she?

22:49.086 --> 22:51.000
It's time to
put Samson down.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.086
You don't know
about Samson, do you?

22:57.130 --> 22:59.130
[chuckles]

22:59.173 --> 23:02.478
Surely Agent Barrett
wrote about him in that,

23:02.521 --> 23:05.347
that psych profile she
holds so near and dear?

23:05.391 --> 23:07.434
I'm listening.

23:10.652 --> 23:15.826
Once there was a boy whose
father was in the Navy.

23:15.869 --> 23:22.000
He was a captain, with enough
bravery and determination

23:22.043 --> 23:25.826
to make up for his
son's obvious shortcomings.

23:25.869 --> 23:30.304
One day, the young man turned
to the captain for help.

23:30.347 --> 23:32.521
You see, his aging horse,
Samson, was sick,

23:32.565 --> 23:34.260
and a decision
needed to be made.

23:34.304 --> 23:37.739
Now, the boy knew that
a visit from the vet

23:37.782 --> 23:39.956
meant putting
the animal down.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.826
Which was the right
and humane thing to do.

23:43.869 --> 23:48.652
But what kind of lesson would
that be for the boy to learn?

23:48.695 --> 23:51.391
So the captain
drew his sidearm.

23:51.434 --> 23:56.304
Fired... point blank.

23:58.956 --> 24:02.434
Put poor Samson
out of his misery.

24:02.478 --> 24:05.565
Would you like me to put you
out of your misery, Cobb?

24:05.608 --> 24:08.521
Your agent is still
out there, Gibbs.

24:12.782 --> 24:15.391
Now, what kind of
lesson would you learn

24:15.434 --> 24:17.695
if my actions were humane?

24:20.347 --> 24:22.739
You failed as a Navy officer.

24:22.782 --> 24:25.173
You were an embarrassment
to the CIA.

24:25.217 --> 24:28.565
A disappointment
to your dad.

24:28.608 --> 24:31.086
And you want to
teach me a lesson?

24:33.739 --> 24:35.739
Where is she?

24:39.521 --> 24:42.826
Who's holding the sidearm now?

24:48.347 --> 24:50.826
Tell me what you know.

24:54.695 --> 24:57.260
[sighs] Kort oversaw
two divisions.

24:57.304 --> 25:00.086
The first one was
a legitimate covert squad

25:00.130 --> 25:02.130
operating under the
auspices of the Agency.

25:02.173 --> 25:04.304
Operation Frankenstein.

25:04.347 --> 25:06.000
Now, the second one

25:06.043 --> 25:08.304
was a team designed for,
uh, the private sector.

25:08.347 --> 25:09.478
Hit men.

25:09.521 --> 25:11.391
Guns for hire.

25:11.434 --> 25:13.304
Used mostly by rich,
foreign politicos

25:13.347 --> 25:15.130
with targets on their
backs, you understand?

25:15.173 --> 25:16.695
Who collected the profits?

25:16.739 --> 25:18.086
I can't tell you that.

25:18.130 --> 25:19.478
What I will tell you is that

25:19.521 --> 25:22.391
Kort skimmed enough
off the top to retire.

25:22.434 --> 25:25.347
And do you think Cobb would have
turned himself in the way he did

25:25.391 --> 25:28.521
unless he was after
something very specific?

25:28.565 --> 25:31.347
Something he could only
find right here at NCIS?

25:41.565 --> 25:43.043
Have you gone bloody mad?!

25:43.086 --> 25:45.434
What does Cobb really want?

25:45.478 --> 25:47.956
You have no idea
how high this goes.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.086
I know all about
Operation Frankenstein.

25:50.130 --> 25:52.521
You don't know anything.

25:52.565 --> 25:56.173
Certain people had a lot
to gain from this project.

25:56.217 --> 25:57.521
I need to find Ziva.

25:57.565 --> 26:01.130
Stop looking for
a straight line, DiNozzo!

26:01.173 --> 26:04.304
If this were a chess game,
think four moves ahead.

26:04.347 --> 26:06.826
It's all about the checkmate.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.956
He's clever that way.

26:15.739 --> 26:17.565
Abbs? You okay?

26:19.565 --> 26:22.086
The blood on Cobb's hands...

26:22.130 --> 26:23.565
It's Ziva's.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.695
It does not mean
that she's gone.

26:28.739 --> 26:31.521
You find anything
on Cobb's clothes?

26:31.565 --> 26:32.826
Um...

26:32.869 --> 26:37.260
There's concrete dust
from the ground

26:37.304 --> 26:39.478
where Cade and
Levin were shot...

26:39.521 --> 26:40.913
that's no big surprise.

26:40.956 --> 26:45.347
But I found some weird trace
elements on his pants.

26:45.391 --> 26:48.782
There was dead bluegrass,
and sheet-metal rust

26:48.826 --> 26:52.956
and some homeopathic oils.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.695
It was, uh, arnica, and
butcher's broom and bitterwort.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.956
Bitterwort?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.217
Yeah.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.956
Also known as gentian.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.217
It aids in muscle aches
in older people.

27:03.260 --> 27:05.913
What if they weren't people?

27:08.391 --> 27:10.739
Remember: positive.

27:15.956 --> 27:17.826
Start talking, McGee.

27:17.869 --> 27:19.478
Abby forwarded
the chemical breakdowns

27:19.521 --> 27:20.956
she found on Cobb's clothing.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.652
Any link to
a horse named Samson?

27:22.695 --> 27:25.434
McGEE: All the oils are used in
over-the-counter liniments.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.608
For horses to keep their
muscles limber...
Yeah.

27:27.652 --> 27:29.652
GIBBS:
Yeah, McGee. I know
what they are.

27:29.695 --> 27:32.347
Pull up location of the
Cobb family farm in Maryland.

27:32.391 --> 27:35.434
McGEE:
Captain Lowell Cobb bought the
horse farm in Burtonsville

27:35.478 --> 27:37.391
22 years ago.

27:37.434 --> 27:39.652
When he died, he and Jonas
hadn't spoken in years.

27:39.695 --> 27:42.956
The land fell into disarray
and was auctioned off later.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.652
Go. Find DiNozzo.

27:44.695 --> 27:45.956
And Ray Cruz.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.521
You think Ziva's there?

27:47.565 --> 27:49.782
Yeah. You can bet
the farm on it.

27:49.826 --> 27:52.608
Road trip.
If you don't mind,
Gibbs, I'd like to come.

27:52.652 --> 27:54.130
Got orders from upstairs.
They want you benched.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.521
Who?

27:56.956 --> 27:59.608
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

27:59.652 --> 28:01.260
Talk about what, Gibbs?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.478
I know that your
uncle is SECNAV.

28:07.521 --> 28:11.130
I have since day one.

28:11.173 --> 28:14.217
That's supposed to
be confidential.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.391
I gotta know my
team, Barrett.

28:18.521 --> 28:20.913
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

28:20.956 --> 28:22.608
With all due respect,

28:22.652 --> 28:26.086
I've worked hard to get here.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.695
I earned Rota.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.956
And my personal relationship
to the Secretary

28:30.000 --> 28:31.347
had nothing to do with it.

28:31.391 --> 28:33.608
I never said it did.

28:38.043 --> 28:39.956
RAY:
All clear!
TONY:
Nothing here, boss.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.608
McGEE:
Looks totally abandoned.

28:48.913 --> 28:52.347
[toy cymbals crashing,
monkey hooting]

28:55.173 --> 28:57.217
Heads up...

29:07.521 --> 29:09.869
[muffled yelling]

29:09.913 --> 29:11.043
RAY:
Ziva...

29:11.086 --> 29:12.347
You all right?

29:12.391 --> 29:14.173
I'm all right.

29:14.217 --> 29:16.739
ZIVA:
Hiding me is a decoy, Gibbs.

29:16.782 --> 29:18.347
Get her up.

29:18.391 --> 29:19.608
ZIVA:
It's a distraction.

29:19.652 --> 29:20.956
[groans]

29:21.000 --> 29:22.086
Cobb needed to
keep you occupied.

29:22.130 --> 29:23.652
Why?

29:23.695 --> 29:25.652
He surrendered because he
needed to get inside NCIS.

29:25.695 --> 29:27.869
It is the only way
he can get close

29:27.913 --> 29:29.478
to the man he holds responsible.

29:29.521 --> 29:30.652
Close to who? Vance?

29:30.695 --> 29:32.086
SECNAV.

29:32.130 --> 29:34.043
Davenport's got
24-hour security.

29:34.086 --> 29:35.869
Yeah, well, his niece,
Special Agent Barrett, doesn't.

29:37.739 --> 29:39.347
[dials phone]

29:42.826 --> 29:44.913
Uh... Agent Barrett,

29:44.956 --> 29:47.391
I was just, uh... just
coming up to see you.Beat you to it, Palmer.

29:47.434 --> 29:50.043
We were on our way down
before taking Cobb to lock-up.

29:52.695 --> 29:55.043
Get B2.

29:58.086 --> 29:59.695
Yeah, I'll be real quick.

29:59.739 --> 30:02.652
Fastest DNA swab
in the East.

30:08.956 --> 30:11.043
Did I hear you're
getting married?

30:11.086 --> 30:13.173
Yes. In the spring.

30:13.217 --> 30:15.260
Her name is Breena.

30:15.304 --> 30:16.782
Yeah.

30:16.826 --> 30:18.652
Yeah...

30:18.695 --> 30:20.043
[elevator bell dings]

30:23.869 --> 30:25.304
[groans]

30:35.000 --> 30:36.260
Round two, Barrett.

30:36.304 --> 30:37.478
[Palmer gasping]

30:37.521 --> 30:39.478
We're going to
the M.E. van.

30:43.086 --> 30:45.782
We're taking a drive.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.695
Update?

30:57.739 --> 30:59.652
Cameras showed Cobb
forced EJ and Palmer

30:59.695 --> 31:01.173
to take him to
the autopsy garage.

31:01.217 --> 31:04.000
McGEE:
Security said that Palmer
signed out the M.E. van.

31:04.043 --> 31:05.608
So the guards didn't think
twice about checking it.

31:05.652 --> 31:07.304
TONY:
Agent was rushed to the E.R.

31:07.347 --> 31:10.260
with a concussion and a broken
nose, but he's all right.

31:10.304 --> 31:12.478
Both Palmer and EJ's cell
phones have been disabled,

31:12.521 --> 31:14.217
so GPS tracking
is inoperable.

31:14.260 --> 31:15.478
BOLOs?

31:15.521 --> 31:17.478
Went out to the FBI
and Metro P.D.

31:17.521 --> 31:19.043
And the Agency's on it, too.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.086
GIBBS:
Davenport?

31:21.130 --> 31:22.652
SECNAV's been called
and is on his way.

31:22.695 --> 31:24.869
Uncle SECNAV.

31:24.913 --> 31:27.043
She could have
mentioned that.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.782
Maybe she did not want
you to think less of her.

31:29.826 --> 31:32.695
I know what it's like to have
a relative in a place of power.

31:32.739 --> 31:36.434
It can...
influence things.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.347
We'll find them.

31:41.173 --> 31:43.869
How do we know this plan
is going to work?

31:43.913 --> 31:45.695
We don't,
Mr. Secretary.

31:45.739 --> 31:48.391
Cobb had the chance to hurt
Special Agent Barrett once, sir.

31:48.434 --> 31:50.869
He didn't, as a message to you.

31:50.913 --> 31:52.695
VANCE:
He wanted to show you
how humane he could be.

31:52.739 --> 31:54.217
He had to get your attention.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.304
GIBBS:
He used EJ as bait.

31:56.347 --> 31:59.173
Found this in Autopsy.

31:59.217 --> 32:02.304
"We'll be waiting at home."

32:02.347 --> 32:04.000
At home, Leon.

32:04.043 --> 32:06.521
The building.

32:06.565 --> 32:08.695
Where Cade and Levin were hit.

32:08.739 --> 32:11.043
It's where the Frankenstein
training occurred.

32:11.086 --> 32:13.173
There's nothing left of it.There is for Cobb, sir.

32:13.217 --> 32:15.086
He's going back to
where it all started.

32:15.130 --> 32:17.956
I may have conceived
of this project,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.173
but the Secretary
dictated its actions.

32:27.956 --> 32:29.391
Certain jobs
were accepted

32:29.434 --> 32:33.608
that neither the CIA nor
the Navy officially authorized.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.565
Then why order them?

32:35.608 --> 32:38.652
Off-the-record political favors.

32:38.695 --> 32:42.000
I was smart enough
to steer clear.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.521
Kort handled the private jobs.

32:43.565 --> 32:45.521
Well, who's handling Kort?

32:45.565 --> 32:47.608
Mistakes were made,
gentlemen.

32:47.652 --> 32:48.652
Doesn't mean
more people have to die.

32:56.347 --> 32:59.217
I'm giving my resignation
to the President

32:59.260 --> 33:00.521
as soon as this is over.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.913
Let's take care of
this son of a bitch.

33:12.086 --> 33:14.043
DAVENPORT:
Cobb?

33:14.086 --> 33:16.217
[water running]

33:21.826 --> 33:23.434
Cobb, you hear me?

33:26.913 --> 33:29.391
[muffled groaning]

33:36.478 --> 33:38.565
What the hell
are you doing, Lieutenant?

33:40.869 --> 33:42.739
Training.

33:44.913 --> 33:46.217
To do what, exactly?

33:47.652 --> 33:49.391
Well, as my teacher

33:49.434 --> 33:51.652
Officer Kort once said...

33:53.956 --> 33:55.652
...we had to maintain composure

33:55.695 --> 33:57.260
under the most
arduous situations.

33:57.304 --> 33:58.826
[panting]

33:58.869 --> 34:00.043
Tried to kill him, sir.

34:03.043 --> 34:06.434
Agent Kort made the mistake of
trying to stop me himself.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.086
[groans]

34:10.652 --> 34:14.434
Those who can't do, teach.

34:16.217 --> 34:19.434
You know...

34:19.478 --> 34:23.000
I've actually admired your
niece's tenacity for some time.

34:23.043 --> 34:26.434
She's a good agent.

34:26.478 --> 34:29.304
Beautiful girl.

34:29.347 --> 34:32.000
Of course, her
connection to you

34:32.043 --> 34:34.347
is why I started in Rota.

34:34.391 --> 34:36.652
To make sure we ended together.

34:40.739 --> 34:42.434
Well, surely, you didn't
come alone, Mr. Secretary?

34:46.217 --> 34:48.869
We came to
arrest you, Cobb.

34:48.913 --> 34:49.695
Drop the weapon.

34:51.260 --> 34:54.043
It's not that easy, Gibbs.

34:54.086 --> 34:56.521
Don't do it.

34:58.695 --> 35:01.347
You know...

35:01.391 --> 35:06.086
I thought I was being trained
to do what was right.

35:08.260 --> 35:09.652
Drop the gun, Lieutenant.

35:09.695 --> 35:12.608
We can talk about this.

35:14.956 --> 35:15.956
We want to help you.

35:28.608 --> 35:29.869
Liar.

35:37.434 --> 35:39.913
[bystanders yelling,
car alarm wails]

35:51.913 --> 35:53.869
So, what's next?

35:53.913 --> 35:55.173
Rota?

35:55.217 --> 35:57.869
Cade's been
reassigned stateside.

35:57.913 --> 36:00.782
Oh, stateside as
in local, Simon?

36:00.826 --> 36:02.869
No, McGee.

36:02.913 --> 36:04.695
Stateside as in
Bremerton, Washington.

36:04.739 --> 36:06.565
I'm gonna spend

36:06.608 --> 36:08.695
some time with my family
while things heal.

36:08.739 --> 36:10.304
That's good.

36:10.347 --> 36:11.782
Very sorry to see you go,
of course.

36:11.826 --> 36:13.652
Yeah, right.

36:17.043 --> 36:19.000
So you're putting together
a new team, or what?

36:19.043 --> 36:22.391
I'm giving up
my post, too, Tony.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.695
Need some time
to decide what's next.

36:26.739 --> 36:28.347
Ah.

36:30.782 --> 36:32.130
You can have Rota, if you want.

36:36.043 --> 36:37.608
I think I'll stay put.

36:37.652 --> 36:40.260
No sense walking away
from a good thing.

36:40.304 --> 36:41.652
That a compliment,
DiNozzo?

36:41.695 --> 36:43.782
No, boss. Sorry. Never.

36:45.913 --> 36:49.391
I'm thinking about sticking
around D.C. for a while.

36:49.434 --> 36:50.695
Really?

36:50.739 --> 36:51.956
Were you?

36:52.000 --> 36:55.043
It's a real small town,
you know.

36:55.086 --> 36:59.000
Maybe, uh, we'll bump into
each other sometime.

37:01.173 --> 37:03.000
It's possible.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.086
Thank you, Erica Jane Barrett.

37:08.130 --> 37:10.000
For everything.

37:18.347 --> 37:19.869
See you, Gibbs.

37:21.391 --> 37:22.173
It's been real.

37:24.608 --> 37:27.000
Come back anytime,
Special Agent Barrett.

37:27.043 --> 37:29.695
Maybe I will.

37:44.652 --> 37:47.043
It's empty.

37:47.086 --> 37:49.608
You disappointed?

37:49.652 --> 37:51.086
Well, I know
what I would like better.

37:51.130 --> 37:53.608
Consider it
a promise.

37:53.652 --> 37:56.304
What kind of promise?

37:56.347 --> 37:57.695
That we have lots

37:57.739 --> 37:59.956
to talk about when I get back.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I have to work outside
of the country.

38:04.347 --> 38:05.652
For how long?

38:05.695 --> 38:06.782
It could take a while.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.434
Then don't go. Stay.

38:10.608 --> 38:12.043
I can't.

38:12.086 --> 38:15.652
Well, tell them that
I threatened to divorce you.

38:15.695 --> 38:16.913
They know I'm not married.

38:19.304 --> 38:22.478
Well, if you keep doing this,
you'll never be.

38:22.521 --> 38:25.565
Hey. Come here.

38:31.304 --> 38:35.217
Is this good-bye?

38:35.260 --> 38:37.000
For now.

38:37.043 --> 38:38.565
How do I know?

38:38.608 --> 38:40.130
You gave me an empty box.

38:40.173 --> 38:41.521
Mm-mm.

38:41.565 --> 38:43.565
I gave you
a promise.

Having you here
as the new SECNAV,

41:05.826 --> 41:07.739
Clay, is a heck
of a surprise.
Tell me about
it, Leon.

41:07.782 --> 41:09.217
When the
President called

41:09.260 --> 41:11.173
to offer me the job, I was
convinced it was a prank.

41:11.217 --> 41:12.478
[chuckles]

41:12.521 --> 41:13.826
People are excited to have you.

41:13.869 --> 41:15.347
Well, I'm happy
to be here.

41:15.391 --> 41:16.347
You still box?

41:16.391 --> 41:17.478
Oh, once in a while.

41:17.521 --> 41:19.695
I can't take a beating
the way I used to.

41:19.739 --> 41:22.695
Oh, try working on the Hill
as a lobbyist, 24/7.

41:22.739 --> 41:24.260
That wasn't a beating,
it was a massacre.

41:24.304 --> 41:25.652
[laughs]

41:25.695 --> 41:28.173
So what can I do for you?

41:28.217 --> 41:30.739
What's our first order
of business?

41:30.782 --> 41:32.652
First, promise to protect my ass

41:32.695 --> 41:35.217
as long as it's your sworn duty
as NCIS director.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.173
Easy enough.
What else?

41:38.608 --> 41:40.304
Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

41:41.956 --> 41:43.086
I've already been
in touch with him.

41:43.130 --> 41:44.695
Mind if I
bring him in?

41:44.739 --> 41:46.956
You've spoken to Agent DiNozzo?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.217
Twice, I think.

41:48.260 --> 41:48.913
May I?

41:56.565 --> 41:59.086
Agent DiNozzo,
sit down.

41:59.130 --> 42:01.217
Sir.

42:01.260 --> 42:02.000
Director.

42:07.304 --> 42:10.913
Director Vance, I'm authorizing
Agent DiNozzo access

42:10.956 --> 42:12.652
to sensitive
compartmented information

42:12.695 --> 42:14.434
commensurate with
the Black Program.

42:14.478 --> 42:15.652
None of your other team
members need to know.

42:15.695 --> 42:18.130
Is that clear?

42:18.173 --> 42:20.043
Actually, Clay,
I'm a little concerned.

42:20.086 --> 42:21.956
Secretary Jarvis

42:22.000 --> 42:23.869
when we're
talking shop.

42:23.913 --> 42:25.347
So...

42:25.391 --> 42:28.521
an agent,
somewhere in your organization,

42:28.565 --> 42:30.000
is selling
top-secret information,

42:30.043 --> 42:31.826
and they need to be
dealt with appropriately.

42:31.869 --> 42:35.043
Mr. Secretary, I'd like
to discuss this first.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.608
There's nothing else
to talk about.

42:40.347 --> 42:42.217
If you're uncomfortable
with this,

42:42.260 --> 42:44.130
Agent DiNozzo and I
can do it without you.

42:47.869 --> 42:48.782
Take a look.

42:49.913 --> 42:53.000
That's who
you're handling.

42:53.043 --> 42:56.130
Do whatever it takes.

42:56.173 --> 42:58.434
Any questions?
