00:45.408 --> 00:48.969
SAGAN: <i>This is the age of</i>
<i>planetary exploration...</i>

00:49.179 --> 00:52.615
<i>... when our ships have begun</i>
<i>to sail the heavens.</i>

00:54.150 --> 00:57.745
<i>In those heavens, there are</i>
<i>some worlds much like hell.</i>

00:57.954 --> 01:01.856
<i>Our planet is, in comparison,</i>
<i>much like a heaven.</i>

01:02.058 --> 01:04.288
<i>But the gates of heaven and hell...</i>

01:04.494 --> 01:07.554
<i>... are adjacent and unmarked.</i>

01:10.066 --> 01:12.534
The Earth is a lovely...

01:12.736 --> 01:15.000
...and more or less placid place.

01:15.472 --> 01:18.270
Things change, but slowly.

01:18.475 --> 01:23.037
You can lead a full life and never
encounter a natural catastrophe...

01:23.246 --> 01:25.077
...more violent than a storm.

01:25.281 --> 01:27.749
And so we become complacent...

01:27.951 --> 01:29.145
...relaxed...

01:29.352 --> 01:31.047
...unconcerned.

01:31.287 --> 01:35.747
But in the history of the solar
system and even in human history...

01:35.959 --> 01:38.621
...there are clear records
of extraordinary...

01:38.828 --> 01:40.989
...and devastating catastrophes.

01:41.197 --> 01:43.791
We have now achieved
the dubious distinction...

01:44.000 --> 01:46.161
...of making our own
major catastrophes...

01:46.369 --> 01:49.099
...both intentional and inadvertent.

01:49.873 --> 01:52.205
On the landscapes of other planets...

01:52.409 --> 01:54.900
...where past records
are better preserved...

01:55.111 --> 01:57.579
...there's abundant evidence
of major catastrophes.

01:57.781 --> 01:59.578
It's all a matter of time scale.

01:59.783 --> 02:02.445
An event which is improbable
in 100 years...

02:02.652 --> 02:05.416
...may be inevitable
in 100 million.

02:05.622 --> 02:08.785
But even on the Earth
in this century...

02:08.992 --> 02:12.655
...there have been
bizarre natural events.

02:17.434 --> 02:20.130
<i>In remote central Siberia...</i>

02:20.336 --> 02:22.395
<i>... there was a time</i>
<i>when the Tungus people...</i>

02:22.605 --> 02:25.574
<i>... told strange tales</i>
<i>of a giant fireball...</i>

02:25.775 --> 02:28.801
<i>... that split the sky</i>
<i>and shook the Earth.</i>

02:30.413 --> 02:32.813
<i>They told of a blast</i>
<i>of searing wind...</i>

02:33.016 --> 02:35.416
<i>... that knocked down</i>
<i>people and forests.</i>

02:37.153 --> 02:39.815
<i>It happened, they said,</i>
<i>on a summer's morning...</i>

02:40.023 --> 02:41.854
<i>... in the year 1908.</i>

02:42.158 --> 02:43.591
<i>In the late 1920s...</i>

02:43.793 --> 02:46.660
<i>... L.A. Kulik, a Soviet scientist...</i>

02:46.863 --> 02:49.923
<i>... organized expeditions</i>
<i>to try and solve the mystery.</i>

02:52.302 --> 02:55.863
<i>He built boats to penetrate</i>
<i>this trackless land:</i>

02:56.439 --> 02:58.031
<i>Snowbound in winter...</i>

02:58.241 --> 03:00.801
<i>... a swampy morass in summer.</i>

03:03.613 --> 03:07.208
<i>Eyewitnesses told of</i>
<i>a ball of flame...</i>

03:07.417 --> 03:08.941
<i>... larger than the sun...</i>

03:09.152 --> 03:12.952
<i>... that had blazed across the sky</i>
<i>20 years before.</i>

03:13.590 --> 03:17.424
<i>Kulik assumed a giant meteorite</i>
<i>had struck the Earth.</i>

03:19.963 --> 03:23.524
<i>He expected to find an enormous</i>
<i>impact crater...</i>

03:23.733 --> 03:25.860
<i>... and rare meteorite fragments...</i>

03:26.069 --> 03:28.799
<i>... chipped off some distant asteroid.</i>

03:31.808 --> 03:33.742
<i>However, at ground zero...</i>

03:33.943 --> 03:37.037
<i>... Kulik found upright trees</i>
<i>stripped of their branches...</i>

03:37.247 --> 03:40.045
<i>... but not a trace of the meteorite</i>
<i>or its impact crater.</i>

03:40.250 --> 03:41.911
<i>He was deeply puzzled.</i>

03:42.118 --> 03:46.111
<i>He thought there were meteorite</i>
<i>fragments buried in the swampy ground.</i>

03:47.056 --> 03:50.617
<i>So he set about digging trenches</i>
<i>and pumping out the water.</i>

03:50.827 --> 03:54.354
<i>But the expected meteoritic rock</i>
<i>and iron was not found.</i>

03:56.499 --> 03:59.764
<i>Undaunted, Kulik went on</i>
<i>to make a thorough survey...</i>

03:59.969 --> 04:02.733
<i>... despite the swarms of insects</i>
<i>and other hardships.</i>

04:02.939 --> 04:05.737
<i>Because he discovered something that,</i>
<i>in his own words...</i>

04:05.942 --> 04:10.879
<i>..."exceeded all tales of eyewitnesses</i>
<i>and my wildest expectations."</i>

04:13.383 --> 04:17.114
<i>For more than 20 kilometers</i>
<i>in every direction from ground zero...</i>

04:17.320 --> 04:22.257
<i>... the trees were flattened radially</i>
<i>outward like broken matchsticks.</i>

04:26.763 --> 04:28.788
<i>There must've been</i>
<i>a powerful explosion...</i>

04:28.998 --> 04:31.023
<i>... several kilometers</i>
<i>above the ground.</i>

04:31.234 --> 04:34.032
<i>The pressure wave, spreading out</i>
<i>at the speed of sound...</i>

04:34.237 --> 04:37.729
<i>... was reconstructed from barometric</i>
<i>records at weather stations...</i>

04:37.941 --> 04:42.571
<i>... across Siberia, through Russia</i>
<i>and on into Western Europe.</i>

04:42.779 --> 04:46.271
<i>Dust from the explosion reflected</i>
<i>so much sunlight back to Earth...</i>

04:46.482 --> 04:48.541
<i>... that people could</i>
<i>read by it at night...</i>

04:48.751 --> 04:52.084
<i>... in London, 10,000 kilometers away.</i>

04:57.360 --> 05:00.989
This really remarkable occurrence...

05:01.197 --> 05:04.098
...is called the Tunguska Event.

05:04.634 --> 05:06.158
But what was it?

05:06.569 --> 05:10.699
Well, perhaps, some scientists
have suggested...

05:10.907 --> 05:14.775
...it was a chunk of antimatter
from space...

05:14.978 --> 05:19.381
...annihilated on contact with
the ordinary matter of the Earth...

05:19.582 --> 05:22.915
...disappearing in a flash
of gamma rays.

05:23.319 --> 05:27.483
But the radioactivity you'd expect
from matter-antimatter annihilation...

05:27.690 --> 05:31.182
...is to be found nowhere
at the impact site.

05:32.128 --> 05:36.394
Or, perhaps, other scientists
have suggested...

05:36.599 --> 05:38.931
...it was a mini black hole
from space...

05:39.135 --> 05:41.126
...which impacted the Earth
in Siberia...

05:41.337 --> 05:43.703
...tunneled through
the solid body of Earth...

05:43.906 --> 05:46.170
...and plunged out the other side.

05:46.376 --> 05:49.573
But the records of atmospheric
shock waves give not a hint...

05:49.779 --> 05:54.273
...of something booming out of
the North Atlantic later that day.

05:54.517 --> 05:58.954
Or maybe, other people have speculated,
it was a spaceship...

05:59.155 --> 06:03.489
...of some unimaginably advanced
extraterrestrial civilization...

06:03.693 --> 06:06.253
...in desperate mechanical trouble...

06:06.462 --> 06:10.626
...crashing in a remote region
of an obscure planet.

06:10.933 --> 06:14.733
Well, if so, it's pretty startling
that at the impact site...

06:14.937 --> 06:18.566
...there is not a piece,
not the tiniest transistor...

06:18.775 --> 06:21.141
...of a crashed spacecraft.

06:21.344 --> 06:24.279
More prosaically, perhaps it was
a large meteorite...

06:24.480 --> 06:26.880
...or a small asteroid
which hit the Earth.

06:27.083 --> 06:30.575
But even here,
there are no observable telltale...

06:30.787 --> 06:33.779
...rocky or metallic fragments
of the sort...

06:33.990 --> 06:36.652
...that you'd expect
from such an impact.

06:36.959 --> 06:40.087
The key point of the Tunguska Event...

06:40.296 --> 06:44.596
...is that there was a tremendous
explosion, a great shock wave...

06:44.801 --> 06:48.032
...many trees burned,
an enormous forest fire...

06:48.271 --> 06:52.708
...and yet, no crater in the ground.

06:52.909 --> 06:55.343
There seems to be
only one explanation...

06:55.545 --> 06:58.105
...which is consistent
with these facts.

06:58.314 --> 07:01.340
And that explanation is this:

07:02.285 --> 07:06.187
In 1908, a piece of a comet...

07:06.389 --> 07:07.788
...hit the Earth.

07:14.764 --> 07:16.789
<i>No one saw it approach.</i>

07:16.999 --> 07:21.493
<i>A small point of light</i>
<i>lost in the glare of the morning sun.</i>

07:23.406 --> 07:26.807
<i>It had been drifting for centuries</i>
<i>through the inner solar system...</i>

07:27.009 --> 07:31.241
<i>... like an iceberg in the ocean</i>
<i>of interplanetary space.</i>

07:38.287 --> 07:40.687
<i>But this time, by accident...</i>

07:40.890 --> 07:43.484
<i>... there was a planet in the way.</i>

07:49.832 --> 07:53.563
<i>From the time and direction of</i>
<i>its approach, what hit the Earth...</i>

07:53.770 --> 07:57.536
<i>... seems to have been a fragment</i>
<i>of a comet named Encke.</i>

07:57.740 --> 08:01.073
<i>Hurtling at more than</i>
<i>100,000 kilometers an hour...</i>

08:01.277 --> 08:04.644
<i>... it was a mountain of ice</i>
<i>about the size of a football field...</i>

08:04.847 --> 08:08.283
<i>... and weighing almost a million tons.</i>

08:09.485 --> 08:13.182
<i>There was no warning, until</i>
<i>it plunged into the atmosphere.</i>

08:16.325 --> 08:18.623
(COMET RUMBLES)

08:54.263 --> 08:57.664
<i>If such an explosion happened today...</i>

08:57.867 --> 09:00.597
<i>... it might be thought,</i>
<i>in the panic of the moment...</i>

09:01.204 --> 09:03.536
<i>... to be produced by a nuclear weapon.</i>

09:03.806 --> 09:06.536
<i>Such a cometary impact and fireball...</i>

09:06.742 --> 09:10.234
<i>... simulates all the effects</i>
<i>of a 15-megaton nuclear burst...</i>

09:10.446 --> 09:13.074
<i>... including the mushroom cloud,</i>
<i>with one exception:</i>

09:13.282 --> 09:15.273
<i>There would be no radiation.</i>

09:15.484 --> 09:18.476
<i>So could a rare but natural event...</i>

09:18.688 --> 09:20.713
<i>... the impact of a comet with Earth...</i>

09:20.923 --> 09:23.517
<i>... trigger a nuclear war?</i>

09:24.360 --> 09:27.796
It's a strange scenario:
A small comet hits the Earth...

09:27.997 --> 09:30.431
...as millions have during
Earth's history...

09:30.633 --> 09:32.601
...and the response
of our civilization...

09:32.802 --> 09:36.033
...is promptly to self-destruct.

09:37.607 --> 09:40.940
Maybe it's unlikely,
but it might be a good idea...

09:41.143 --> 09:44.635
...to understand comets
and collisions and catastrophes...

09:44.847 --> 09:47.475
...a little bit better than we do.

09:47.683 --> 09:51.744
Now, a comet, at least as far as
we understand them today...

09:51.954 --> 09:53.285
...is made mostly of ice:

09:53.489 --> 09:56.322
Water ice, maybe some ammonia ice...

09:56.525 --> 09:58.789
...a little bit of methane ice.

09:59.195 --> 10:01.993
So in striking
the Earth's atmosphere...

10:02.198 --> 10:04.291
...a modest cometary fragment...

10:04.500 --> 10:09.369
...will produce a great radiant
fireball and a mighty blast wave.

10:09.572 --> 10:11.802
It'll burn trees and level forests...

10:12.008 --> 10:14.670
...and make a sound
heard around the world.

10:14.877 --> 10:17.744
But it need not make
a crater in the ground.

10:17.947 --> 10:22.384
Why? Because the ices in the comet
are all melted in the impact.

10:22.585 --> 10:26.043
And there's going to be very
few recognizable pieces of comet...

10:26.255 --> 10:27.745
...left on the ground.

10:34.397 --> 10:37.195
<i>We humans like to think of</i>
<i>the heavens as stable...</i>

10:37.400 --> 10:39.891
<i>... serene, unchanging.</i>

10:41.804 --> 10:43.704
<i>But comets suddenly appear...</i>

10:43.906 --> 10:48.036
<i>... and hang ominously in the sky,</i>
<i>night after night, for weeks.</i>

10:50.413 --> 10:54.816
So the idea developed that the comet
had to be there for a reason.

10:55.017 --> 10:58.282
The reason was that comets were
predictions of disaster...

10:58.487 --> 11:02.821
...that they foretold the deaths
of princes and the fall of kingdoms.

11:03.025 --> 11:05.516
In 1066, for example...

11:05.728 --> 11:09.824
...the Normans witnessed an apparition
or appearance of Halley's comet.

11:10.032 --> 11:13.832
Since a comet must, they thought,
predict the fall of some kingdom...

11:14.036 --> 11:16.300
...they promptly invaded England.

11:16.505 --> 11:19.099
Here's King Harold of England
looking a little glum.

11:19.308 --> 11:21.674
The events were noted
in the Bayeux tapestry...

11:21.877 --> 11:24.505
...a kind of newspaper of the day.

11:24.714 --> 11:26.773
Or, in the early 13th century...

11:26.983 --> 11:30.510
...Giotto, one of the founders
of modern realistic painting...

11:30.720 --> 11:33.314
...witnessed another apparition
of comet Halley...

11:33.522 --> 11:36.787
...and inserted it into a nativity
he was painting.

11:36.993 --> 11:41.225
A harbinger of a different
sort of change of kingdoms.

11:41.897 --> 11:44.195
Around 1517...

11:44.400 --> 11:48.166
...another great comet appeared.
This time it was seen in Mexico.

11:48.371 --> 11:50.236
And the Aztec emperor, Moctezuma...

11:50.573 --> 11:52.200
...maybe this is he...

11:52.775 --> 11:54.766
...promptly executed his astrologers.

11:54.977 --> 11:59.573
Why? They hadn't predicted the comet,
and they sure hadn't explained it.

11:59.782 --> 12:04.685
Moctezuma was positive that the comet
foretold some dreadful disaster.

12:04.887 --> 12:07.481
He became distant and gloomy...

12:07.690 --> 12:10.158
...and in that way,
helped to set the stage...

12:10.359 --> 12:14.261
...for the successful Spanish conquest
of Mexico under Cortés.

12:14.764 --> 12:18.393
In many cases, a superstitious
belief in comets...

12:18.601 --> 12:21.536
...becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

12:22.371 --> 12:24.931
Here are two quite different
representations...

12:25.141 --> 12:27.769
...of the great comet of 1577:

12:27.977 --> 12:30.673
This one pictured by the Turks...

12:33.549 --> 12:35.881
...and this one by the Germans.

12:42.458 --> 12:45.757
In 1705, Edmund Halley finally...

12:45.961 --> 12:48.486
...figured out that the same
spectacular comet...

12:48.697 --> 12:52.497
...was booming by the Earth
every 76 years, like clockwork.

12:52.701 --> 12:56.432
That comet is now called,
appropriately, comet Halley.

12:56.639 --> 13:00.439
And it's the same one that we talked
about before, the comet of 1066.

13:00.643 --> 13:03.578
At that point, the subject began
to lose a little...

13:03.779 --> 13:07.146
...of its burden of superstition,
but hardly all.

13:07.349 --> 13:11.115
Public fear of comets survived.
Well, for example...

13:11.654 --> 13:14.817
...look at this terribly
nasty comet of 1857...

13:15.024 --> 13:18.460
...that some people figured
would splinter the Earth.

13:19.795 --> 13:23.856
By 1910, Halley's comet
returned once more.

13:24.066 --> 13:27.524
But this time, astronomers using
a new tool, the spectroscope...

13:27.736 --> 13:32.639
...had discovered cyanogen gas
in the tail of a comet.

13:32.842 --> 13:35.174
Now, cyanogen is a poison.

13:35.377 --> 13:39.006
The Earth was to pass through
this poisonous tail.

13:39.215 --> 13:43.208
The fact that the gas was
astonishingly, fabulously thin...

13:43.419 --> 13:45.580
...reassured almost nobody.

13:45.788 --> 13:50.088
For example, look at the headlines
in the <i>Los Angeles Examiner...</i>

13:50.292 --> 13:52.988
...for May 9, 1910:

13:53.195 --> 13:57.188
"Say, Has That Comet
'Cyanogened' You Yet?"

13:57.399 --> 14:00.493
"Entire Human Race Due
For Free Gaseous Bath.

14:00.703 --> 14:02.728
Expect High Jinks."

14:02.938 --> 14:07.807
Or take this from the <i>San Francisco</i>
<i>Chronicle,</i> May 15, 1910:

14:08.010 --> 14:11.605
"Comet Comes And Husband Reforms."

14:11.814 --> 14:14.009
"Comet Parties Now Fad In New York."

14:14.216 --> 14:16.047
Amazing stuff!

14:16.252 --> 14:19.688
In 1910, people were holding
comet parties, not so much to...

14:19.889 --> 14:23.484
...celebrate the end of the world
as to make merry before it happened.

14:23.726 --> 14:28.254
There were entrepreneurs
who were hawking comet pills.

14:28.697 --> 14:30.756
I think I'm gonna take one for later.

14:30.966 --> 14:33.799
And there were those
who were selling...

14:34.270 --> 14:39.207
...gas masks to protect
against the cyanogen.

14:39.608 --> 14:43.977
And comet nuttiness
didn't stop in 1910.

14:49.218 --> 14:53.154
<i>Long before 1066,</i>
<i>humans marveled at comets.</i>

14:53.355 --> 14:56.552
<i>Our generation is beginning</i>
<i>to understand them.</i>

15:05.267 --> 15:07.599
<i>Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars...</i>

15:07.803 --> 15:11.261
<i>... are small planets made mostly</i>
<i>of rock and iron.</i>

15:12.041 --> 15:15.204
<i>Farther out where it's colder,</i>
<i>are the giant planets...</i>

15:15.411 --> 15:17.174
<i>... made mostly of gas.</i>

15:17.379 --> 15:20.576
<i>But comets originate from</i>
<i>a great cloud beyond the planets...</i>

15:20.783 --> 15:23.013
<i>... almost halfway to the nearest star.</i>

15:23.219 --> 15:25.449
<i>Occasionally, one falls in...</i>

15:25.654 --> 15:27.747
<i>... accelerated by the sun's gravity.</i>

15:27.957 --> 15:30.152
<i>Because it's made mostly of ice,</i>
<i>the comet...</i>

15:30.359 --> 15:32.486
<i>... evaporates as it approaches</i>
<i>the sun.</i>

15:32.695 --> 15:35.562
<i>The vapor is blown back</i>
<i>by the solar wind...</i>

15:35.764 --> 15:37.629
<i>... forming the cometary tail.</i>

15:37.833 --> 15:40.199
<i>Then it's flung back</i>
<i>into outer darkness...</i>

15:40.402 --> 15:41.733
<i>... its orbit so large...</i>

15:41.937 --> 15:44.735
<i>... that it will not return</i>
<i>for millions of years.</i>

15:44.940 --> 15:47.500
<i>These are the long-period comets.</i>

15:47.710 --> 15:51.077
<i>For every one plunging close enough</i>
<i>to the sun to be discovered...</i>

15:51.280 --> 15:53.009
<i>... there may be a billion others...</i>

15:53.215 --> 15:56.275
<i>... slowly drifting</i>
<i>beyond Pluto's orbit.</i>

15:56.785 --> 16:01.279
<i>Very rarely, a long-period comet is</i>
<i>captured in the inner solar system...</i>

16:01.490 --> 16:03.458
<i>... becoming a short-period comet.</i>

16:03.659 --> 16:07.117
<i>It passes near a major planet,</i>
<i>like Saturn.</i>

16:07.329 --> 16:09.957
<i>The planet provides</i>
<i>a small gravitational tug...</i>

16:10.165 --> 16:12.998
<i>... enough to deflect it</i>
<i>into a much smaller orbit.</i>

16:13.202 --> 16:15.864
<i>Though few are captured this way,</i>
<i>those that are...</i>

16:16.071 --> 16:19.905
<i>... become well-known because</i>
<i>they all return in short intervals.</i>

16:20.109 --> 16:23.772
<i>Once trapped in the inner</i>
<i>solar system, among the planets...</i>

16:23.979 --> 16:27.176
<i>... the chances of another</i>
<i>near-collision are increased.</i>

16:28.884 --> 16:31.546
<i>Here, a second encounter</i>
<i>with Saturn...</i>

16:31.754 --> 16:35.588
<i>... further reduces the comet's</i>
<i>orbital period to decades.</i>

16:35.791 --> 16:39.955
<i>A comet may take 10,000 years</i>
<i>between close planetary encounters.</i>

16:40.162 --> 16:43.996
<i>But in this computer study,</i>
<i>we've sped things up.</i>

16:44.633 --> 16:47.500
<i>A third encounter,</i>
<i>this time with Jupiter...</i>

16:47.703 --> 16:50.672
<i>... further reduces</i>
<i>the comet's orbital period.</i>

16:50.873 --> 16:53.535
<i>Now the comet must approach the sun...</i>

16:53.742 --> 16:56.336
<i>... and grow a tail every few years.</i>

16:56.545 --> 16:59.878
<i>Since the dust and gas in the tail</i>
<i>are lost forever to space...</i>

17:00.082 --> 17:02.710
<i>... the comet must slowly be eroding.</i>

17:02.918 --> 17:04.579
<i>Pieces of it break off.</i>

17:04.787 --> 17:07.881
<i>Sometimes, as we've seen,</i>
<i>they even strike the Earth.</i>

17:08.090 --> 17:09.523
<i>In a few thousand years...</i>

17:09.725 --> 17:12.751
<i>... if a short-period comet</i>
<i>hasn't hit a planet...</i>

17:12.961 --> 17:15.589
<i>... it will have evaporated away</i>
<i>almost entirely...</i>

17:15.798 --> 17:19.894
<i>... leaving sand-sized fragments,</i>
<i>which become meteors...</i>

17:20.102 --> 17:24.198
<i>... and its core which, perhaps,</i>
<i>becomes an asteroid.</i>

17:26.475 --> 17:30.275
Suppose I were a pretty typical comet.

17:30.479 --> 17:33.004
And what you would see
would be a kind of...

17:33.215 --> 17:35.809
...tumbling snowball...

17:36.018 --> 17:40.352
...spending most of my time out here
in the outer solar system.

17:40.556 --> 17:42.581
I'd be a kilometer across.

17:42.791 --> 17:44.554
I'd be living most of my days...

17:44.760 --> 17:48.719
...in the gloom beyond Saturn,
orbiting the sun.

17:48.931 --> 17:51.297
But once every century,
I would find myself...

17:51.500 --> 17:54.526
...careening inward,
faster and faster...

17:54.737 --> 17:57.103
...towards the inner solar system.

17:58.640 --> 18:02.076
By the time I would cross
the orbit of Jupiter...

18:02.277 --> 18:04.108
...on my way to the orbit of Mars...

18:04.313 --> 18:07.714
...I'd be heating up because
I'd be getting closer to the sun.

18:07.916 --> 18:09.781
I'd be evaporating a little bit.

18:09.985 --> 18:12.112
Small pieces of dust and ice...

18:12.321 --> 18:15.552
...would be blown behind me
by the solar wind...

18:15.758 --> 18:19.091
...forming an incipient cometary tail.

18:19.294 --> 18:21.728
On the scale of such
a solar system model...

18:21.930 --> 18:24.831
...l, me, a cometary nucleus...

18:25.033 --> 18:27.228
...would be smaller than a snowflake.

18:27.436 --> 18:31.736
Although, when fully developed,
my tail would be longer...

18:31.940 --> 18:35.239
...than the spacing
between the worlds.

18:36.612 --> 18:38.546
Now, sooner or later...

18:38.747 --> 18:42.513
...comets on these long, elliptical
trajectories around the sun...

18:42.718 --> 18:44.913
...must collide with planets.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.588
The Earth and the moon...

18:47.790 --> 18:51.453
...must have been bombarded
by comets and asteroids...

18:51.660 --> 18:54.629
...the debris from the early history
of the solar system.

18:54.830 --> 18:58.630
In interplanetary space, there are
more small objects than large ones.

18:58.834 --> 19:01.894
So there must be,
on a given planetary surface...

19:02.104 --> 19:06.404
...many more impacts of small objects
than of large objects.

19:06.608 --> 19:10.442
So a thing like the Tunguska impact
happens on the Earth...

19:10.646 --> 19:12.238
...maybe every thousand years.

19:12.448 --> 19:15.645
But the impact of a giant
cometary nucleus...

19:15.851 --> 19:17.785
...like Halley's comet, let's say...

19:17.986 --> 19:20.648
...happens only every
billion years or so.

19:21.390 --> 19:24.689
Now, is there evidence
of past collisions?

19:25.861 --> 19:27.260
<i>When a large comet...</i>

19:27.463 --> 19:30.125
<i>... or a large, rocky asteroid</i>
<i>hits a planet...</i>

19:30.332 --> 19:32.630
<i>... it makes a bowl-shaped crater.</i>

19:32.835 --> 19:36.999
<i>The well-preserved impact craters on</i>
<i>Earth were all formed fairly recently.</i>

19:37.206 --> 19:40.539
<i>The older ones have been softened,</i>
<i>filled in or rubbed out...</i>

19:40.742 --> 19:43.302
<i>... by running water</i>
<i>and mountain building.</i>

19:43.512 --> 19:47.004
<i>Impacts make craters on other worlds</i>
<i>and about as often.</i>

19:47.216 --> 19:48.683
<i>But when the air is thin...</i>

19:48.884 --> 19:52.581
<i>... when water rarely flows,</i>
<i>when mountain building is feeble...</i>

19:52.788 --> 19:55.086
<i>... the ancient craters are retained.</i>

19:55.290 --> 19:58.088
<i>This is the case on the moon</i>
<i>and Mercury and Mars...</i>

19:58.293 --> 20:00.989
<i>... our neighboring</i>
<i>terrestrial planets.</i>

20:02.498 --> 20:04.728
They huddle around the sun...

20:04.933 --> 20:07.265
...their source of heat and light...

20:07.469 --> 20:10.768
...a little bit like campers
around a fire.

20:11.139 --> 20:13.733
They are about
41/2 billion years old.

20:13.942 --> 20:17.901
And all bear witness
to an age long gone...

20:18.113 --> 20:20.809
...of major collisions...

20:21.016 --> 20:25.419
...which do not happen at that scale
and frequency anymore.

20:26.054 --> 20:29.023
If we move out past...

20:29.224 --> 20:31.886
...the terrestrial planets
beyond Mars...

20:32.094 --> 20:36.155

...in the realm of Jupiter...

20:38.667 --> 20:41.898
...and the other giant,
or Jovian planets.

20:42.938 --> 20:47.432
These are great worlds
composed largely of the gases...

20:47.643 --> 20:50.168
...hydrogen and helium,
some other stuff too.

20:50.379 --> 20:55.180
When we look at the surface,
we do not see a solid surface...

20:55.384 --> 20:59.150
...but only an occasional patch
of atmosphere...

20:59.354 --> 21:02.881
...and a complex array
of multicolored clouds.

21:03.191 --> 21:04.852
These are serious planets...

21:05.060 --> 21:09.156
...not fragmentary little world-lets
like the Earth.

21:09.364 --> 21:13.061
In fact, 1000 Earths would fit...

21:13.268 --> 21:15.634
...in the volume of Jupiter.

21:15.837 --> 21:19.705
If a comet or asteroid were to...

21:19.908 --> 21:24.845
...accidentally impact Jupiter, it would
be very unlikely to leave a crater.

21:25.047 --> 21:28.448
It might make a momentary hole
in the clouds, but that's it.

21:28.650 --> 21:32.347
Nevertheless, we know
that the outer solar system...

21:32.554 --> 21:35.546
...has been subject to
a many-billion-year history...

27:07.489 --> 27:09.457
(RINGING)

27:10.492 --> 27:14.656
<i>So there may be physical evidence</i>
<i>in the age of space flight...</i>

27:15.030 --> 27:19.467
<i>... for the account of the Canterbury</i>
<i>monks in the 12th century.</i>

27:22.370 --> 27:25.237
<i>If 800 years ago</i>
<i>a big asteroid hit the moon...</i>

27:25.440 --> 27:27.374
<i>... the crater should be</i>
<i>prominent today...</i>

27:27.575 --> 27:29.975
<i>... still surrounded by bright rays...</i>

27:30.178 --> 27:33.545
<i>... thin streamers of dust</i>
<i>spewed out by the impact.</i>

27:33.748 --> 27:36.182
<i>In billions of years,</i>
<i>lunar rays are eroded...</i>

27:36.384 --> 27:37.976
<i>... but not in hundreds.</i>

27:38.186 --> 27:41.849
<i>And there is a recent ray crater</i>
<i>called Giordano Bruno...</i>

27:42.057 --> 27:45.493
<i>... in the region of the moon</i>
<i>where an explosion was reported...</i>

27:45.694 --> 27:47.559
<i>... in 1178.</i>

27:53.234 --> 27:55.202
<i>The entire evolution of the moon...</i>

27:55.403 --> 27:57.871
<i>... is a story of catastrophes.</i>

27:58.073 --> 27:59.665
<i>41/2 billion years ago...</i>

27:59.874 --> 28:02.570
<i>... the moon was accreting</i>
<i>from interplanetary boulders...</i>

28:02.777 --> 28:05.371
<i>... and craters were forming</i>
<i>all over its surface.</i>

28:05.580 --> 28:08.413
<i>The energy so released</i>
<i>helped melt the crust.</i>

28:08.616 --> 28:13.076
<i>After most of this debris was swept up</i>
<i>by the moon, the surface cooled.</i>

28:13.521 --> 28:15.853
<i>But about 3.9 billion years ago...</i>

28:16.057 --> 28:18.992
<i>... a great asteroid impacted.</i>

28:23.765 --> 28:27.895
<i>It generated an expanding shock wave</i>
<i>and re-melted some of the surface.</i>

28:28.103 --> 28:30.128
<i>The resulting basin</i>
<i>was then flooded...</i>

28:30.338 --> 28:31.930
<i>... probably by dark lava...</i>

28:32.140 --> 28:35.507
<i>... producing one of</i>
<i>the dry seas on the moon.</i>

28:35.710 --> 28:38.907
<i>More recent impacts excavated</i>
<i>craters with bright rays...</i>

28:39.114 --> 28:42.811
<i>... named after Eratosthenes</i>
<i>and Copernicus.</i>

28:43.018 --> 28:45.043
<i>The familiar features</i>
<i>of the man in the moon...</i>

28:45.253 --> 28:48.279
<i>... are a chronicle of ancient impacts.</i>

28:49.858 --> 28:52.520
<i>Most of the original asteroids</i>
<i>were swept up...</i>

28:52.727 --> 28:54.718
<i>... in the making</i>
<i>of the moon and planets.</i>

28:54.929 --> 28:58.057
<i>Many still orbit the sun</i>
<i>in the asteroid belt.</i>

28:58.266 --> 29:01.895
<i>Some, themselves almost fractured</i>
<i>by gravity tides...</i>

29:02.103 --> 29:04.264
<i>... and by impacts</i>
<i>with other asteroids...</i>

29:04.472 --> 29:08.169
<i>... have been captured by planets:</i>
<i>Phobos around Mars, for example...</i>

29:08.376 --> 29:12.437
<i>... or a close moon of Jupiter</i>
<i>called Amalthea.</i>

29:14.049 --> 29:16.882
Similar to the asteroid belt
are the rings of Saturn...

29:17.085 --> 29:21.715
...composed of millions
of small, tumbling, icy moonlets.

29:21.923 --> 29:25.381
Maybe the rings of Saturn
are a moon...

29:25.593 --> 29:29.723
...which was prevented from
forming by the tides of Saturn.

29:29.931 --> 29:33.128
Or maybe it's the remains
of a moon that wandered too close...

29:33.334 --> 29:35.928
...and was torn apart by
the tides of Saturn.

29:36.137 --> 29:39.072
It's certainly a lovely place.

29:39.274 --> 29:43.404
Jupiter also has
a newly discovered ring system...

29:43.611 --> 29:46.341
...which is invisible from the Earth.

29:49.050 --> 29:53.987
Now, there is a curious argument...

29:54.255 --> 29:57.713
...alleging major recent collisions
in the solar system...

29:57.926 --> 30:00.417
...proposed by a psychiatrist...

30:00.628 --> 30:04.530
...named Immanuel Velikovsky in 1950.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.197
He suggested...

30:07.402 --> 30:10.929
...that an object of planetary mass,
which he called a comet...

30:11.139 --> 30:14.631
...was somehow produced
in the Jupiter system.

30:14.843 --> 30:18.108
He doesn't say exactly
how it's produced...

30:18.947 --> 30:20.312
...but maybe...

30:23.718 --> 30:25.948
...it's spat out...

30:29.090 --> 30:30.421
...of Jupiter.

30:31.259 --> 30:36.196
Anyway, however it was made
some 3500 years ago, he imagines...

30:36.764 --> 30:41.497
...it made repeated
close encounters with Mars...

30:42.337 --> 30:44.669
...with the Earth-moon system...

30:45.039 --> 30:49.976
...having as entertaining
biblical consequences...

30:50.845 --> 30:55.544
...the parting of the Red Sea so that
Moses and the Israelites could...

30:55.750 --> 30:58.378
...safely avoid the host of pharaoh...

30:58.586 --> 31:01.350
...and the stopping of
the Earth's rotation when...

31:01.556 --> 31:06.050
...Joshua commanded the sun
to stand still in Gibeon.

31:06.261 --> 31:08.889
He also imagined that
there was extensive flooding...

31:09.097 --> 31:12.328
...and the volcanoes all over
the Earth at that time.

31:12.834 --> 31:17.430
Well, then after
a very complicated game...

31:17.639 --> 31:21.370
...of interplanetary billiards
is completed...

31:21.576 --> 31:26.104
...Velikovsky proposed
that this comet...

31:26.314 --> 31:30.216
...entered into a stable,
almost perfectly circular orbit...

31:30.418 --> 31:31.715
...becoming...

31:34.522 --> 31:36.149
...the planet Venus...

31:36.357 --> 31:39.724
...which he claimed
never existed until then.

31:41.095 --> 31:45.930
Now, these ideas are
almost certainly wrong.

31:46.534 --> 31:49.196
There's no objection
in astronomy to collisions.

31:49.404 --> 31:51.599
We've seen collision fragments...

31:51.806 --> 31:55.105
...and evidence throughout
the solar system.

31:55.310 --> 31:59.144
The problem is with recent
and major collisions.

31:59.347 --> 32:01.577
In any scale model like this...

32:01.783 --> 32:05.048
...it's impossible to have both
the sizes of the planets...

32:05.253 --> 32:07.721
...and the sizes of their orbits
to the same scale...

32:07.922 --> 32:11.085
...because then the planets
would be too small to see.

32:11.292 --> 32:14.352
If the planets were really
to scale in such a model...

32:14.562 --> 32:17.030
...as grains of dust...

32:17.232 --> 32:19.496
...it would then be entirely clear...

32:19.701 --> 32:22.636
...that a comet entering
the inner solar system...

32:22.837 --> 32:25.738
...would have a negligible chance
of colliding with a planet...

32:25.940 --> 32:28.101
...in only a few thousand years.

32:28.309 --> 32:29.606
Moreover...

32:29.811 --> 32:33.269
...Venus is a rocky and metallic...

32:33.481 --> 32:35.847
...hydrogen-poor world...

32:36.050 --> 32:38.985
...whereas Jupiter, where Velikovsky
imagines it comes from...

32:39.187 --> 32:41.815
...is made of almost nothing
but hydrogen.

32:42.023 --> 32:46.824
There is no energy source in Jupiter
to eject planets or comets.

32:47.028 --> 32:50.759
If one did enter
the inner solar system...

32:50.965 --> 32:54.492
...there is no way it could stop
the Earth from rotating.

32:54.702 --> 32:58.103
And if it could, there's no way
Earth could start rotating again...

32:58.306 --> 33:00.706
...at anything like 24 hours a day.

33:00.908 --> 33:04.241
There's no geological evidence
for flooding and volcanism...

33:04.445 --> 33:06.504
...3500 years ago.

33:06.714 --> 33:09.877
Babylonian astronomers
observed Venus...

33:10.084 --> 33:12.712
...in its present stable orbit...

33:12.920 --> 33:15.912
...before Velikovsky said it existed.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.649
And so on.

33:23.164 --> 33:25.928
There are many hypotheses
in science which are wrong.

33:26.134 --> 33:29.661
That's all right. It's the aperture
to finding out what's right.

33:29.871 --> 33:32.704
Science is a self-correcting process.

33:32.907 --> 33:35.432
To be accepted,
new ideas must survive...

33:35.643 --> 33:39.943
...the most rigorous standards
of evidence and scrutiny.

33:40.281 --> 33:43.273
The worst aspect of
the Velikovsky affair is not...

33:43.484 --> 33:46.044
...that many of his ideas were
wrong or silly...

33:46.254 --> 33:48.916
...or in gross contradiction
to the facts.

33:49.123 --> 33:52.991
Rather, the worst aspect is
that some scientists...

33:53.194 --> 33:56.561
...attempted to suppress
Velikovsky's ideas.

33:56.798 --> 34:01.030
The suppression of uncomfortable ideas
may be common in religion...

34:01.235 --> 34:05.103
...or in politics,
but it is not the path to knowledge.

34:05.306 --> 34:08.605
And there's no place for it
in the endeavor of science.

34:08.810 --> 34:10.505
We do not know beforehand...

34:10.712 --> 34:14.739
...where fundamental insights
will arise from...

34:14.949 --> 34:19.079
...about our mysterious
and lovely solar system.

34:19.287 --> 34:22.916
And the history of our study
of the solar system shows clearly...

34:23.124 --> 34:27.151
...that accepted and conventional
ideas are often wrong...

34:27.362 --> 34:29.330
...and that fundamental insights...

34:29.530 --> 34:33.364
...can arise from
the most unexpected sources.

34:35.002 --> 34:36.765
<i>We've evolved on the planet Earth...</i>

34:36.971 --> 34:39.565
<i>... and so we find it</i>
<i>a congenial place.</i>

34:39.774 --> 34:42.106
<i>But just next door is Venus...</i>

34:42.310 --> 34:45.302
<i>... until recently, enveloped</i>
<i>in mystery.</i>

34:45.513 --> 34:48.414
<i>It has almost the same size</i>
<i>and mass as the Earth.</i>

34:48.616 --> 34:52.609
<i>Might our sister world</i>
<i>be a balmy summer planet...</i>

34:52.820 --> 34:56.153
<i>... a little warmer than the Earth</i>
<i>because it's closer to the sun?</i>

34:56.357 --> 35:00.691
<i>Are there craters, volcanoes,</i>
<i>mountains, oceans, life?</i>

35:01.729 --> 35:06.428
<i>The first to look at Venus through</i>
<i>a telescope was Galileo in 1609.</i>

35:06.634 --> 35:09.432
But all he could see
was a featureless disk.

35:10.004 --> 35:13.531
As optical telescopes got bigger,
that's all anybody could see:

35:13.741 --> 35:16.335
A disk with no details on it at all.

35:16.544 --> 35:20.310
Venus evidently was covered
with an opaque layer...

35:20.515 --> 35:23.643
...thick clouds concealing the surface.

35:23.851 --> 35:28.447
For centuries, even the composition
of the clouds of Venus was unknown.

35:28.656 --> 35:33.184
I mean, you could go outside, look up,
see Venus with the naked eye...

35:33.394 --> 35:36.488
...observe sunlight reflected
from the clouds of Venus.

35:36.697 --> 35:39.291
What were you looking at?
What were the clouds made of?

35:39.500 --> 35:41.058
Nobody knew.

35:41.269 --> 35:44.966
As a result, imagination ran riot.

35:45.173 --> 35:48.040
The absence of anything you
could see on Venus...

35:48.242 --> 35:51.678
...led some scientists and others
to deduce...

35:51.879 --> 35:54.040
...that the surface was a swamp.

35:55.349 --> 35:59.342
The argument, if we can dignify it
with such a phrase...

35:59.754 --> 36:00.686
...went like this:

36:00.888 --> 36:03.186
"I can't see a thing
on the surface of Venus."

36:03.391 --> 36:04.050
"Why not?"

36:04.258 --> 36:07.386
"Because it's covered with
a dense layer of clouds."

36:07.595 --> 36:09.062
"What are clouds made of?"

36:09.263 --> 36:12.892
"Water, of course. Therefore, Venus
must have a lot of water on it."

36:13.100 --> 36:14.590
"Then the surface must be wet."

36:14.802 --> 36:17.498
"If the surface is wet,
it's probably a swamp.

36:17.705 --> 36:20.538
If there's a swamp, there's ferns.
If there's ferns...

36:20.741 --> 36:23.107
...maybe there's even dinosaurs."

36:23.311 --> 36:25.245
Observation:
You couldn't see a thing.

36:25.446 --> 36:28.040
Conclusion: dinosaurs.

36:28.616 --> 36:31.414
If just looking at Venus
was so unproductive...

36:31.619 --> 36:33.052
...what else could you do?

36:33.254 --> 36:36.621
The next clue came from
early work with that:

36:36.824 --> 36:38.348
A glass prism.

36:38.559 --> 36:42.689
An intense beam of ordinary white
light is passed through a narrow slit...

36:42.897 --> 36:44.489
...and then through the prism.

36:44.699 --> 36:47.293
The result is to spread
the white light out...

36:47.502 --> 36:50.869
...into its constituent
rainbow of colors.

36:51.506 --> 36:54.839
<i>This rainbow pattern</i>
<i>is called a spectrum.</i>

36:55.042 --> 36:57.840
<i>Think about it.</i>
<i>White light enters the prism...</i>

36:58.045 --> 37:00.809
<i>... what comes out of the prism</i>
<i>is colored light.</i>

37:01.015 --> 37:03.040
<i>Lots of colors.</i>
<i>Where did they come from?</i>

37:03.251 --> 37:05.276
<i>They must've been hiding</i>
<i>in the white light.</i>

37:05.486 --> 37:08.614
<i>White light must be</i>
<i>a mixture of many colors.</i>

37:08.823 --> 37:11.587
<i>Here we see the spectrum</i>
<i>running from...</i>

37:11.792 --> 37:15.193
<i>... violet, blue, green,</i>
<i>yellow, orange, to red.</i>

37:15.396 --> 37:19.833
<i>Since we see these colors, we call</i>
<i>this the spectrum of visible light.</i>

37:20.868 --> 37:24.895
<i>The sun emits lots of visible light.</i>
<i>The air is transparent to it.</i>

37:25.106 --> 37:27.768
<i>So our eyes evolved</i>
<i>to work in visible light.</i>

37:27.975 --> 37:31.467
<i>But there are many other frequencies</i>
<i>of light which our eyes can't detect.</i>

37:31.679 --> 37:33.738
<i>Beyond the violet</i>
<i>is the ultraviolet.</i>

37:33.948 --> 37:37.076
<i>It's just as real, but you need</i>
<i>instruments to detect it.</i>

37:37.285 --> 37:40.618
<i>Beyond the ultraviolet are</i>
<i>the x-rays and then the gamma rays.</i>

37:41.155 --> 37:43.521
<i>On the other side of visible light,</i>
<i>beyond the red...</i>

37:43.724 --> 37:46.454
<i>... is the infrared,</i>
<i>again real, again invisible.</i>

37:46.661 --> 37:49.858
<i>Beyond the infrared</i>
<i>are the radio waves.</i>

37:50.064 --> 37:53.830
Now, this entire range from
the gamma rays way over there...

37:54.035 --> 37:56.435
...to the radio waves
all the way over here...

37:56.637 --> 37:59.003
...are simply different
kinds of light.

37:59.206 --> 38:01.401
They differ only in the frequency.

38:01.609 --> 38:04.578
They're all useful, by the way,
in astronomy.

38:04.779 --> 38:07.407
But because of the limitations
of our eyes...

38:07.615 --> 38:11.949
...we have a prejudice,
a bias, a chauvinism...

38:12.153 --> 38:15.748
...to this tiny rainbow band
of visible light.

38:15.957 --> 38:20.121
<i>Now, a spectrum can be used</i>
<i>in a simple and elegant way...</i>

38:20.361 --> 38:23.626
<i>... to determine the chemical</i>
<i>composition of the atmosphere...</i>

38:23.831 --> 38:25.196
<i>... of a planet or star.</i>

38:25.399 --> 38:27.765
<i>Different atoms and molecules</i>
<i>absorb...</i>

38:27.969 --> 38:30.733
<i>... different frequencies</i>
<i>or colors of light.</i>

38:30.938 --> 38:35.432
<i>And those absorbed or missing</i>
<i>frequencies appear as black lines...</i>

38:35.643 --> 38:39.477
<i>... in the spectrum of the light</i>
<i>we receive from the planet or star.</i>

38:39.680 --> 38:44.014
Each and every substance
has a characteristic fingerprint...

38:44.218 --> 38:46.516
...a spectral signature...

38:46.721 --> 38:49.656
...which permits it to be detected
over a great distance.

38:49.857 --> 38:53.418
As a result, the gases
in the atmosphere of Venus...

38:53.628 --> 38:56.529
...at a distance of
60 million kilometers...

38:56.731 --> 39:00.462
...their composition's been determined
from the Earth.

39:00.668 --> 39:05.162
It's amazing to me still, we can tell
what a thing is made out of...

39:05.373 --> 39:09.002
...at an enormous distance away,
without ever touching it.

39:10.344 --> 39:14.474
<i>Our eyes can't see in the near</i>
<i>infrared part of the spectrum.</i>

39:14.682 --> 39:16.081
<i>But our instruments can.</i>

39:16.283 --> 39:20.117
<i>Here's the absorption pattern</i>
<i>of lots and lots of carbon dioxide:</i>

39:20.321 --> 39:24.781
<i>Dark lines in characteristic patterns</i>
<i>at specific frequencies.</i>

39:25.026 --> 39:27.824
<i>You'd detect a different set</i>
<i>of infrared lines...</i>

39:28.029 --> 39:30.691
<i>... if, say, water vapor were present.</i>

39:31.465 --> 39:36.368
If Venus were really soaking wet,
then you could determine that...

39:36.737 --> 39:40.537
...by finding the pattern
of water vapor in its atmosphere.

39:40.741 --> 39:43.835
But around 1920, when this experiment
was first performed...

39:44.045 --> 39:46.707
...the Venus atmosphere seemed to
have not a hint...

39:46.914 --> 39:51.112
...not a smidgen, not a trace
of water vapor above the clouds.

39:51.318 --> 39:55.414
And so instead of a swampy,
soaking wet surface...

39:55.623 --> 39:59.286
...it was suggested that Venus
was bone-dry, a desert planet...

39:59.493 --> 40:02.985
...with clouds composed
of fine silicate dust.

40:03.564 --> 40:06.431
<i>But later, spectroscopic</i>
<i>observations revealed...</i>

40:06.634 --> 40:08.534
<i>... the characteristic</i>
<i>absorption lines...</i>

40:08.736 --> 40:11.603
<i>... of an enormous amount</i>
<i>of carbon dioxide.</i>

40:11.806 --> 40:16.175
<i>Scientists thought there must be lots</i>
<i>of carbon compounds on the surface...</i>

40:16.377 --> 40:19.972
<i>... making this a planet</i>
<i>covered with petroleum.</i>

40:20.214 --> 40:24.173
<i>Others agreed that the atmosphere was</i>
<i>dry but thought the surface was wet.</i>

40:24.385 --> 40:27.877
<i>With all that CO 2,</i>
<i>it had to be carbonated water.</i>

40:28.089 --> 40:31.991
<i>Venus, they thought, was covered</i>
<i>with a vast ocean of seltzer.</i>

40:32.193 --> 40:35.629
The first hint of the true situation
on Venus came...

40:35.830 --> 40:39.322
...not from the visible, ultraviolet
or infrared part of the spectrum...

40:39.533 --> 40:42.502
...but from over here
in the radio region.

40:42.703 --> 40:46.104
We're used to the idea of
radio signals from intelligent life...

40:46.307 --> 40:50.266
...or at least semi-intelligent life,
radio and television stations.

40:50.478 --> 40:54.471
But there are all kinds of reasons
why natural objects emit radio waves.

40:54.682 --> 40:57.276
One reason is that they're hot.

40:57.585 --> 40:59.553
And when, in 1956...

40:59.754 --> 41:02.917
...Venus was, for the first time,
observed by a radio telescope...

41:03.124 --> 41:06.184
...the planet was discovered
to be emitting radio waves...

41:06.393 --> 41:09.658
...as if it were at
an extremely high temperature.

41:09.864 --> 41:14.597
But the real demonstration that Venus'
surface was astonishingly hot...

41:14.802 --> 41:19.739
...came when the first spacecraft
penetrated the clouds of Venus...

41:20.074 --> 41:24.306
...and slowly settled on the surface
of the nearest planet.

41:27.381 --> 41:32.318
<i>These were the unmanned spacecraft</i>
<i>of the Soviet</i> Venera <i>series.</i>

41:34.922 --> 41:39.586
<i>In our spaceship of the imagination,</i>
<i>we retrace their course.</i>

41:40.995 --> 41:45.432
<i>From a distance, our sister planet</i>
<i>seems serene and peaceful...</i>

41:45.633 --> 41:47.828
<i>... its clouds motionless.</i>

41:50.838 --> 41:54.296
<i>These clouds are near the top</i>
<i>of a great ocean of air...</i>

41:54.508 --> 41:59.275
<i>... about 100 kilometers thick,</i>
<i>composed mainly of carbon dioxide.</i>

42:02.883 --> 42:05.977
<i>There's some nitrogen, a little</i>
<i>water vapor and other gases...</i>

42:06.187 --> 42:09.452
<i>... but only the merest trace</i>
<i>of hydrocarbons.</i>

42:09.857 --> 42:12.291
<i>The clouds turn out to be,</i>
<i>not water...</i>

42:12.493 --> 42:16.054
<i>... but a concentrated solution</i>
<i>of sulfuric acid.</i>

42:25.172 --> 42:26.935
<i>Even in the high clouds...</i>

42:27.141 --> 42:30.838
<i>... Venus is a thoroughly nasty place.</i>

42:39.019 --> 42:41.783
<i>The clouds are stained yellow</i>
<i>by sulfur.</i>

42:41.989 --> 42:43.786
<i>There are great lightning storms.</i>

42:43.991 --> 42:46.289
<i>As we descend, there are</i>
<i>increasing amounts...</i>

42:46.493 --> 42:48.461
<i>... of the noxious gas sulfur dioxide.</i>

42:49.129 --> 42:52.292
<i>The pressures become so high</i>
<i>that early</i> Venera <i>spacecraft...</i>

42:52.499 --> 42:55.093
<i>... were crushed like old tin cans...</i>

42:55.302 --> 42:57.930
<i>... by the weight</i>
<i>of the surrounding atmosphere.</i>

43:00.741 --> 43:03.767
<i>Beneath the clouds</i>
<i>in the dense, clear air...</i>

43:03.978 --> 43:06.538
<i>... it's as bright as</i>
<i>on an overcast day on Earth.</i>

43:06.747 --> 43:10.376
<i>But the atmosphere is so thick</i>
<i>that the ground seems to ripple...</i>

43:10.584 --> 43:12.074
<i>... and distort.</i>

43:12.319 --> 43:16.221
<i>The atmospheric pressure down here is</i>
<i>90 times that on Earth.</i>

43:16.490 --> 43:21.427
<i>The temperature is 380 degrees</i>
<i>centigrade, 900 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

43:21.829 --> 43:24.457
<i>Hotter than the hottest</i>
<i>household oven.</i>

43:24.665 --> 43:27.225
<i>This is a world</i>
<i>marked by searing heat...</i>

43:27.434 --> 43:29.994
<i>... crushing pressures,</i>
<i>sulfurous gases...</i>

43:30.204 --> 43:32.866
<i>... and a desolate, reddish landscape.</i>

43:33.073 --> 43:37.066
<i>Far from the balmy paradise</i>
<i>imagined by some early scientists...</i>

43:37.278 --> 43:41.544
<i>... Venus is the one place</i>
<i>in the solar system most like hell.</i>

43:47.454 --> 43:49.945
<i>But today, as in ancient tradition...</i>

43:50.157 --> 43:54.753
<i>... there are travelers who will dare</i>
<i>a visit to the underworld.</i>

43:54.995 --> 43:57.793
Venera 9 <i>was the first spacecraft</i>
<i>in human history...</i>

43:57.998 --> 44:00.728
<i>... to return a photograph</i>
<i>from the surface of Venus.</i>

44:00.935 --> 44:03.665
<i>It found the rocks curiously eroded...</i>

44:04.238 --> 44:05.865
<i>... perhaps by the corrosive gases...</i>

44:06.073 --> 44:08.371
<i>... perhaps because</i>
<i>the temperature is so high...</i>

44:08.575 --> 44:12.272
<i>... that the rocks are partly molten</i>
<i>and sluggishly flow.</i>

44:12.479 --> 44:17.246
<i>The Soviet</i> Venera <i>spacecraft,</i>
<i>their electronics long ago fried...</i>

44:17.451 --> 44:20.887
<i>... are slowly corroding</i>
<i>on the surface of Venus.</i>

44:21.088 --> 44:23.147
<i>They are the first spaceships</i>
<i>from Earth...</i>

44:23.357 --> 44:26.121
<i>... ever to land on another planet.</i>

44:30.898 --> 44:32.798
<i>The reason Venus is like hell...</i>

44:33.000 --> 44:36.128
<i>... seems to be what's called</i>
<i>the greenhouse effect.</i>

44:36.337 --> 44:40.034
<i>Ordinary visible sunlight penetrates</i>
<i>the clouds and heats the surface.</i>

44:40.240 --> 44:42.970
<i>But the dense atmosphere</i>
<i>blankets the surface...</i>

44:43.177 --> 44:45.839
<i>... and prevents it from</i>
<i>cooling off to space.</i>

44:46.046 --> 44:48.776
<i>An atmosphere 90 times</i>
<i>as dense as ours...</i>

44:48.983 --> 44:51.713
<i>... made of carbon dioxide,</i>
<i>water vapor and other gases...</i>

44:51.919 --> 44:53.716
<i>... lets in visible light</i>
<i>from the sun...</i>

44:53.921 --> 44:57.982
<i>... but will not let out the infrared</i>
<i>light radiated by the surface.</i>

44:58.192 --> 44:59.682
<i>The temperature rises...</i>

44:59.893 --> 45:02.862
<i>... until the infrared radiation</i>
<i>trickling out to space...</i>

45:03.063 --> 45:06.157
<i>... just balances the sunlight</i>
<i>reaching the surface.</i>

45:09.636 --> 45:12.400
<i>The greenhouse effect can make</i>
<i>an Earth-like world...</i>

45:12.606 --> 45:15.040
<i>... into a planetary inferno.</i>

45:17.277 --> 45:20.337
<i>In this cauldron, there's not likely</i>
<i>to be anything alive...</i>

45:20.547 --> 45:22.674
<i>... even creatures</i>
<i>very different from us.</i>

45:22.883 --> 45:25.977
<i>Organic and other conceivable</i>
<i>biological molecules...</i>

45:26.186 --> 45:28.984
<i>... would simply fall to pieces.</i>

45:41.535 --> 45:44.231
<i>The hell of Venus is</i>
<i>in stark contrast...</i>

45:44.438 --> 45:47.930
<i>... with the comparative heaven</i>
<i>of its neighboring world...</i>

45:48.142 --> 45:51.543
<i>... our little planetary home,</i>
<i>the Earth.</i>

45:53.213 --> 45:57.206
<i>Here, the atmosphere is</i>
<i>90 times thinner.</i>

45:57.418 --> 46:00.387
<i>Here, the carbon dioxide</i>
<i>and water vapor...</i>

46:00.587 --> 46:02.612
<i>... make a modest greenhouse effect...</i>

46:02.823 --> 46:05.815
<i>... which heats the ground</i>
<i>above the freezing point of water.</i>

46:06.026 --> 46:10.520
<i>Without it, our oceans</i>
<i>would be frozen solid.</i>

46:10.731 --> 46:14.098
<i>A little greenhouse effect</i>
<i>is a good thing.</i>

46:25.479 --> 46:28.141
<i>But Venus is an ominous reminder...</i>

46:28.348 --> 46:30.509
<i>... that on a world</i>
<i>rather like the Earth...</i>

46:30.717 --> 46:33.049
<i>... things can go wrong.</i>

46:33.587 --> 46:38.115
<i>There is no guarantee that our planet</i>
<i>will always be so hospitable.</i>

46:38.325 --> 46:40.486
<i>To maintain this clement world...</i>

46:40.694 --> 46:44.255
<i>... we must understand it</i>
<i>and appreciate it.</i>

46:47.501 --> 46:50.197
<i>The Earth is a place to our eyes...</i>

46:50.404 --> 46:53.305
<i>... more beautiful than</i>
<i>any other that we know.</i>

46:53.507 --> 46:56.965
<i>But this beauty has been</i>
<i>sculpted by change:</i>

46:57.177 --> 46:59.805
<i>Gentle, almost undetectable change...</i>

47:00.013 --> 47:02.311
<i>... and sudden, violent change.</i>

47:02.516 --> 47:06.646
<i>In the cosmos,</i>
<i>there is no refuge from change.</i>

47:07.387 --> 47:10.584
The Sphinx:
human head, lion's body...

47:10.791 --> 47:14.227
...constructed more than
5500 years ago.

47:14.661 --> 47:17.596
That face was once crisp
and cleanly rendered...

47:17.798 --> 47:19.493
...like this paw I am standing on.

47:19.700 --> 47:22.726
The paw has been buried
in the sand until recently...

47:22.936 --> 47:25.097
...and protected from erosion.

47:25.606 --> 47:29.269
The face is now muddled
and softened...

47:29.476 --> 47:33.139
...because of thousands of years
of sandblasting in the desert...

47:33.347 --> 47:35.247
...and a little rainfall.

47:35.749 --> 47:39.549
In New York City, there is an obelisk
called Cleopatra's Needle...

47:39.753 --> 47:41.277
...which comes from Egypt.

47:41.488 --> 47:45.618
In only a little more than a century
in New York's Central Park...

47:45.826 --> 47:50.263
...the inscriptions on that obelisk
have been almost totally obliterated.

47:50.464 --> 47:52.955
Not by sand and water...

47:53.167 --> 47:55.635
...but by smog
and industrial pollution.

47:55.836 --> 47:57.827
A bit like the atmosphere of Venus.

47:58.372 --> 48:02.331
Slow erosion wipes out information.

48:02.543 --> 48:03.567
On the Earth...

48:03.777 --> 48:06.109
...mountain ranges are destroyed
by erosion...

48:06.313 --> 48:08.508
...in maybe tens of millions
of years...

48:08.715 --> 48:12.742
...small impact craters in maybe
hundreds of thousands of years.

48:12.953 --> 48:15.717
And the greatest artifacts
of human beings...

48:15.923 --> 48:19.290
...in thousands
or tens of thousands of years.

48:21.528 --> 48:24.986
<i>In addition to such slow</i>
<i>and uniform processes...</i>

48:25.199 --> 48:28.566
<i>... there are rare but sudden</i>
<i>catastrophes.</i>

48:28.769 --> 48:31.533
<i>The Sphinx is missing a nose.</i>

48:31.738 --> 48:35.970
<i>In an act of idle desecration,</i>
<i>some soldiers once shot it off.</i>

48:36.176 --> 48:40.510
<i>If you wait long enough,</i>
<i>everything changes.</i>

48:58.799 --> 49:02.963
<i>Slow, uniform processes,</i>
<i>unheralded events:</i>

49:03.170 --> 49:04.797
<i>The sting of a sand grain...</i>

49:05.005 --> 49:07.030
<i>... the fall of a drop of water...</i>

49:07.241 --> 49:10.904
<i>... can, over the ages,</i>
<i>totally rework the landscape.</i>

49:31.598 --> 49:34.158
<i>And rare, violent processes...</i>

49:34.368 --> 49:37.337
<i>... exceptional events</i>
<i>that will not recur in a lifetime...</i>

49:37.604 --> 49:40.232
<i>... also make major changes.</i>

50:00.927 --> 50:05.057
<i>Both the insignificant</i>
<i>and the extraordinary...</i>

50:05.265 --> 50:08.428
<i>... are the architects</i>
<i>of the natural world.</i>

50:53.180 --> 50:56.206
<i>The destruction of trees</i>
<i>and grasslands...</i>

50:56.416 --> 50:58.850
<i>... makes the surface</i>
<i>of the Earth brighter.</i>

50:59.052 --> 51:03.113
<i>It reflects more sunlight</i>
<i>back to space and cools our planet.</i>

51:04.024 --> 51:05.719
<i>After we discovered fire...</i>

51:05.926 --> 51:09.123
<i>... we began to incinerate forests</i>
<i>intentionally...</i>

51:09.329 --> 51:11.456
<i>... to clear the land</i>
<i>by a process called...</i>

51:11.865 --> 51:14.925
<i>..."slash and burn" agriculture.</i>

51:15.135 --> 51:19.697
And today, forests and grasslands
are being destroyed...

51:19.906 --> 51:24.206
...frivolously, carelessly
by humans who are...

51:24.411 --> 51:28.438
...heedless of the beauty
of our cousins the trees...

51:28.648 --> 51:32.015
...and ignorant of the possible
climatic catastrophes...

51:32.219 --> 51:36.280
...which large-scale burning
of forests may bring.

51:36.757 --> 51:39.123
(TREES BREAKING)

51:41.862 --> 51:44.330
<i>The indiscriminate destruction</i>
<i>of vegetation...</i>

51:44.531 --> 51:46.123
<i>... may alter the global climate...</i>

51:46.333 --> 51:49.268
<i>... in ways that no scientist</i>
<i>can yet predict.</i>

51:50.771 --> 51:53.001
<i>It has already deadened</i>
<i>large patches...</i>

51:53.206 --> 51:55.640
<i>... of the Earth's</i>
<i>life-supporting skin.</i>

52:07.721 --> 52:11.919
<i>And yet, we ravage the Earth</i>
<i>at an accelerated pace...</i>

52:12.125 --> 52:14.457
<i>... as if it belonged</i>
<i>to this one generation...</i>

52:14.661 --> 52:18.256
<i>... as if it were ours</i>
<i>to do with as we please.</i>

52:27.107 --> 52:29.507
<i>The Earth has mechanisms</i>
<i>to cleanse itself...</i>

52:29.709 --> 52:33.042
<i>... to neutralize the toxic substances</i>
<i>in its system.</i>

52:33.246 --> 52:35.840
<i>But these mechanisms work</i>
<i>only up to a point.</i>

52:36.049 --> 52:39.416
<i>Beyond some critical threshold,</i>
<i>they break down.</i>

52:39.619 --> 52:42.850
<i>The damage becomes irreversible.</i>

53:10.917 --> 53:12.851
<i>Our generation must choose.</i>

53:13.053 --> 53:16.147
<i>Which do we value more:</i>
<i>short-term profits...</i>

53:16.356 --> 53:20.349
<i>... or the long-term habitability</i>
<i>of our planetary home?</i>

53:23.396 --> 53:25.364
<i>The world is divided politically.</i>

53:25.565 --> 53:27.999
<i>But ecologically</i>
<i>it is tightly interwoven.</i>

53:28.201 --> 53:31.898
<i>There are no useless threads</i>
<i>in the fabric of the ecosystem.</i>

53:32.172 --> 53:36.006
<i>If you cut any one of them,</i>
<i>you will unravel many others.</i>

53:37.377 --> 53:38.969
<i>We have uncovered other worlds...</i>

53:39.179 --> 53:42.444
<i>... with choking atmospheres</i>
<i>and deadly surfaces.</i>

53:42.716 --> 53:46.049
<i>Shall we then re-create</i>
<i>these hells on Earth?</i>

53:48.822 --> 53:52.724
<i>We have encountered desolate moons</i>
<i>and barren asteroids.</i>

53:52.926 --> 53:57.863
<i>Shall we then scar and crater this</i>
<i>blue-green world in their likeness?</i>

54:16.416 --> 54:19.214
<i>Natural catastrophes are rare.</i>

54:19.419 --> 54:20.852
<i>But they come often enough.</i>

54:21.054 --> 54:24.683
<i>We need not force the hand of nature.</i>

54:34.334 --> 54:38.634
<i>If we ruin the Earth,</i>
<i>there is no place else to go.</i>

54:38.838 --> 54:41.534
<i>This is not a disposable world.</i>

54:41.741 --> 54:45.507
<i>And we are not yet able</i>
<i>to re-engineer other planets.</i>

54:54.020 --> 54:56.545
<i>The cruelest desert on Earth...</i>

54:56.756 --> 55:01.022
<i>... is far more hospitable</i>
<i>than any place on Mars.</i>

55:02.329 --> 55:05.787
<i>The bright, sandy surface</i>
<i>and dusty atmosphere of Mars...</i>

55:05.999 --> 55:09.594
<i>... reflect enough sunlight</i>
<i>back to space to cool the planet...</i>

55:09.803 --> 55:14.740
<i>... freezing out all its water,</i>
<i>locking it in a perpetual ice age.</i>

55:15.709 --> 55:20.271
<i>Human activities brighten</i>
<i>our landscape and our atmosphere.</i>

55:20.480 --> 55:23.711
<i>Might this ultimately</i>
<i>make an ice age here?</i>

55:24.818 --> 55:28.845
<i>At the same time, we are releasing</i>
<i>vast quantities of carbon dioxide...</i>

55:29.055 --> 55:31.785
<i>... increasing the greenhouse effect.</i>

55:31.992 --> 55:34.620
<i>The Earth need not</i>
<i>resemble Venus very closely...</i>

55:34.828 --> 55:37.695
<i>... for it to become</i>
<i>barren and lifeless.</i>

55:41.334 --> 55:44.770
<i>It may not take much</i>
<i>to destabilize the Earth's climate...</i>

55:48.642 --> 55:50.610

The study of the global climate,
the sun's influence...

55:56.916 --> 55:59.544
...the comparison of the Earth
with other worlds...

55:59.753 --> 56:03.189
These are subjects in their
earliest stages of development.

56:03.390 --> 56:06.553
They are funded poorly
and grudgingly.

56:06.760 --> 56:10.890
Meanwhile, we continue to load the
Earth's atmosphere with materials...

56:11.097 --> 56:15.534
...about whose long-term influence
we are almost entirely ignorant.

56:16.903 --> 56:21.397
<i>There are worlds that began with</i>
<i>as much apparent promise as Earth.</i>

56:21.608 --> 56:24.475
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

56:24.678 --> 56:29.206
<i>Knowing that worlds can die</i>
<i>alerts us to our danger.</i>

56:30.350 --> 56:34.252
<i>If a visitor arrived from another</i>
<i>world, what account would we give...</i>

56:34.454 --> 56:37.719
<i>... of our stewardship</i>
<i>of the planet Earth?</i>

56:44.931 --> 56:49.800
In the history of the solar system,
have worlds ever been destroyed?

56:50.904 --> 56:54.101
<i>Most of the moons in the outer</i>
<i>solar system have craters on them...</i>

56:54.307 --> 56:56.741
<i>... made by cometary impacts.</i>

56:57.444 --> 56:59.378
<i>Some have such</i>
<i>large craters though...</i>

56:59.579 --> 57:03.242
<i>... that if the impacting comets</i>
<i>had been just a little bit bigger...</i>

57:03.450 --> 57:05.543
<i>... the moons would have</i>
<i>been shattered.</i>

57:08.121 --> 57:10.681
<i>What would the results of</i>
<i>such a collision look like?</i>

57:10.890 --> 57:12.824
(EXPLOSION)

57:13.727 --> 57:15.422
<i>Maybe a planetary ring.</i>

57:17.897 --> 57:20.764
The idea has been growing
that little worlds are...

57:20.967 --> 57:23.834
...every now and then,
demolished by a cometary impact.

57:24.037 --> 57:28.599
The fragments then slowly coalesce,
and a moon arises again...

57:28.808 --> 57:30.139
...from its own ashes.

57:30.343 --> 57:34.871
Some moons may have been destroyed
and reconstituted many times.

57:36.116 --> 57:39.882
For our own world,
the peril is more subtle.

57:40.520 --> 57:42.215
Since this series was
first broadcast...

57:42.422 --> 57:45.220
...the dangers of the increasing
greenhouse effect...

57:45.425 --> 57:46.983
...have become much more clear.

57:47.193 --> 57:51.425
We burn fossil fuels, like coal
and gas and petroleum...

57:51.631 --> 57:54.156
...putting more carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere...

57:54.367 --> 57:56.699
...and thereby heating the Earth.

57:56.903 --> 57:59.997
The hellish conditions on Venus
are a reminder that...

58:00.206 --> 58:01.639
...this is serious business.

58:02.041 --> 58:04.339
Computer models that
successfully explain...

58:04.544 --> 58:06.478
...the climates of other planets...

58:06.679 --> 58:09.648
...predict the deaths of forests...

58:09.849 --> 58:13.114
...parched croplands,
the flooding of coastal cities...

58:13.319 --> 58:15.412
...environmental refugees...

58:15.622 --> 58:18.887
...widespread disasters
in the next century...

58:19.192 --> 58:20.784
...unless we change our ways.

58:20.994 --> 58:22.484
What do we have to do?

58:22.929 --> 58:24.556
Four things.

58:24.764 --> 58:28.165
One: much more efficient use
of fossil fuels.

58:28.368 --> 58:32.498
Why not cars that get 70 miles
a gallon instead of 25?

58:32.705 --> 58:37.005
Two: research and development
on safe alternative energy sources...

58:37.210 --> 58:38.905
...especially solar power.

58:39.512 --> 58:42.481
Three: reforestation
on a grand scale.

58:42.682 --> 58:46.174
And four: helping to bring
the billion poorest people...

58:46.386 --> 58:48.513
...on the planet
to self-sufficiency...

58:48.721 --> 58:52.054
...which is the key step
in curbing world population growth.

58:52.258 --> 58:56.160
Every one of these steps makes sense
apart from greenhouse warming.

58:56.996 --> 58:59.464
No one has proposed
that the trouble with Venus is...

58:59.666 --> 59:03.693
...that there once was Venusians
who drove fuel-inefficient cars.

59:03.903 --> 59:07.168
But our nearest neighbor,
nevertheless, is a stark warning...

59:07.373 --> 59:10.774
...on the possible fate
of an Earth-like world.
