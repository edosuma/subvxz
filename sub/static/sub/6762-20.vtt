02:32.569 --> 02:36.019
You always try to be optimistic
on the first day of practise,

02:36.196 --> 02:37.440
but l think this year's team

02:37.614 --> 02:39.902
has a legitimate shot
at going all the way.

02:40.074 --> 02:43.276
Well, no offence, coach, but you
did say that about the football team,

02:43.451 --> 02:44.731
and they went 1 -8.

02:44.910 --> 02:46.866
Please.

02:47.495 --> 02:51.740
You're a great sports editor.
The truth is-- This is off-the-record.

02:51.915 --> 02:54.665
--we need help in the relays.
Lots of help.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.541
So if you have any suggestions...

02:56.710 --> 02:59.164
Well, l was on the frosh-soph team
back in Minnesota.

02:59.337 --> 03:01.874
Really? Well, maybe you should
come out for the team.

03:02.047 --> 03:03.077
Yeah, right.

03:05.174 --> 03:06.204
- Yeah.
- All right.

03:06.383 --> 03:08.624
Cahill. Come on, cut it out.

03:08.801 --> 03:10.627
You're gonna demoralize
the rest of the team.

03:10.803 --> 03:13.008
Sorry, coach.

03:13.763 --> 03:15.173
Did Chapman say anything
about me?

03:15.347 --> 03:17.884
Yeah. He said you mean well.

03:18.058 --> 03:20.049
No, really. What'd he say
about the relay team?

03:20.226 --> 03:23.179
- Nothing, really.
- He said we stink, didn't he?

03:23.353 --> 03:24.680
Look, Steve...

03:24.854 --> 03:28.103
You know, if l get cut from one more
sport team this season, l swear...

03:28.273 --> 03:31.605
Hey, come on. You're a good athlete,
it's a long season.

03:31.775 --> 03:33.517
You just gotta think positively.

03:33.693 --> 03:36.443
- Let's go, guys.
- What does she see in that guy?

03:36.612 --> 03:38.900
All right, so when am l gonna
see you girls working out?

03:39.072 --> 03:40.779
l don't do that. l have a note.

03:40.948 --> 03:43.520
What about you, Kelly?
l start jogging at 6:45.

03:44.075 --> 03:46.197
That sounds
a little too serious for me.

03:46.410 --> 03:49.196
Oh, yeah.
Like you need your beauty sleep.

03:50.955 --> 03:52.745
Bye, Kyle.

03:54.499 --> 03:55.992
He is so cute.

03:56.167 --> 03:57.708
When you were going out
last summer,

03:57.876 --> 04:00.579
l thought for sure you'd become
the new campus couple or something.

04:00.753 --> 04:03.290
Well, we're still good friends.

04:03.463 --> 04:05.501
Yeah.

04:07.675 --> 04:10.628
There's something
l've never told anyone.

04:10.802 --> 04:12.675
What?

04:15.722 --> 04:17.879
Kelly,

04:18.932 --> 04:21.137
l've never slept
with a girl before.

04:22.351 --> 04:26.762
So you're a virgin. lt's no big deal.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.602
No, you don't get it.

04:29.773 --> 04:32.061
Look, Kel, l...

04:32.858 --> 04:35.811
l've never slept with a girl before,

04:35.985 --> 04:38.309
and l don't know if l want to.

04:39.446 --> 04:43.905
Look, l don't want anybody
to know about this, all right?

04:44.116 --> 04:46.321
Sure, l understand.

04:48.119 --> 04:49.612
Why are you telling me this?

04:50.787 --> 04:52.197
Because l trust you.

05:00.836 --> 05:04.334
Oh, good, mister.
Stop short to look at nothing.

05:04.546 --> 05:05.743
God, what a jerk.

05:06.631 --> 05:08.290
lt's okay, honey. lt's a green light.

05:08.758 --> 05:10.465
Oh, yeah.

05:10.634 --> 05:12.958
So anyway,
what were we talking about?

05:13.177 --> 05:16.461
- What a safe and sane driver you are.
- Oh, exactly.

05:16.638 --> 05:18.879
l mean, so what if l didn't pass
my test the first time?

05:19.056 --> 05:20.253
Or the third time?

05:20.432 --> 05:22.969
What matters is that
l have my licence now.

05:23.142 --> 05:26.177
And it really bothers me
that Brandon won't let me drive his car,

05:26.395 --> 05:28.885
and that he's still teasing me
about my driving.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.932
So l would like for you and Dad
to tell him to stop.

05:32.149 --> 05:34.555
We'll talk to him about it.
Don't you wanna turn here?

05:34.984 --> 05:36.062
Why?

05:37.611 --> 05:39.188
We live on that street.

05:47.784 --> 05:49.064
Wedgy.

05:49.243 --> 05:53.109
Wedgy. Wedgy. Wedgy.

05:53.288 --> 05:56.371
- Hey, come on, guys.
- Wedgy. Wedgy. Wedgy.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.531
Hey, come on, guys, what did l do?

05:58.750 --> 06:00.907
- You wrote we couldn't block.
- We couldn't tackle.

06:01.085 --> 06:03.160
You wrote our game
against Beverly was embarrassing.

06:03.336 --> 06:05.707
And as exciting as a bingo game
in an old-folks' home.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.164
Hey, l happen to like bingo. Don't you
guys believe in freedom of the press?

06:09.340 --> 06:11.830
What about our right
to hang you by your underwear?

06:12.551 --> 06:16.214
Wedgy. Wedgy. Wedgy.

06:16.387 --> 06:18.758
- Wedgy. Wedgy.
- Hey, hey--

06:18.930 --> 06:22.095
- Wedgy. Wedgy. Wedgy.
- Steve. Steve. Steve.

06:22.266 --> 06:23.640
Hey, buddy.
Come on, do something.

06:23.809 --> 06:25.219
Guys. Guys.

06:25.393 --> 06:28.346
Guys, guys, guys...

06:28.562 --> 06:31.811
All right, on three.

06:31.981 --> 06:36.688
Wedgy. Wedgy. Wedgy!

06:37.359 --> 06:39.896
All right, people. You know the drill.

06:40.070 --> 06:44.397
- Shower up, towel off and go home.
- Brandon, you all right, man?

06:44.573 --> 06:47.489
Yeah, l'm riding a little high,
but l think l'll live to write about it.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.985
Write about it?

06:49.159 --> 06:51.696
Didn't you learn your lesson,
Walsh?

06:51.869 --> 06:54.406
You're a funny guy, Miller.

06:54.579 --> 06:56.072
Thanks, buddy.

06:56.247 --> 06:58.238
Hey, come on, l'm a jock.

06:58.415 --> 07:01.284
Yeah, who l can outskate, outshoot
and probably outrun.

07:01.459 --> 07:02.739
You know what they say:

07:02.918 --> 07:06.120
Those who can, do,
and those who can't, write about it.

07:10.173 --> 07:11.500
So l walked into Chapman's office

07:11.674 --> 07:14.045
and asked him if he was serious
about letting me try out.

07:14.218 --> 07:17.217
He said yes, so we went out
to the track and he timed me.

07:17.386 --> 07:19.958
- He's got me down for the 440 relay.
- Way to go.

07:20.138 --> 07:22.213
Now you'll be writing
about sports from the inside.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.715
l don't know, Andrea.
l don't think l should.

07:24.892 --> 07:27.049
- Why not?
- lt wouldn't be ethical.

07:27.268 --> 07:30.386
Of course it is. Look at Tim Green.
He plays for the Atlanta Falcons

07:30.562 --> 07:33.016
and he's a sports commentator
on National Public Radio.

07:33.189 --> 07:35.227
But between working at the Pit
and the newspaper

07:35.399 --> 07:37.474
and a full class load,
something's gotta give.

07:37.692 --> 07:40.182
So you're saying
you don't want to write for the paper.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.684
l just don't know if l'm cut out
to be a reporter anymore.

07:43.237 --> 07:45.905
What are you talking about, Brandon?
You're an excellent reporter.

07:46.073 --> 07:47.732
But l don't like doing it.

07:48.407 --> 07:50.861
l don't like going up to a guy
after he's blown the big game

07:51.034 --> 07:52.408
and ask him how he feels.

07:52.577 --> 07:54.734
Or coming up with a new way
to say they lost again.

07:54.912 --> 07:56.903
l'm a good athlete.
l want a chance to prove it.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.534
Okay, okay. l get the picture.

07:59.707 --> 08:03.205
You jock. You free agent, you.

08:03.376 --> 08:05.118
Thanks, Andrea.

08:05.294 --> 08:07.285
You know, Griffin could probably
write my column.

08:07.462 --> 08:09.537
Or maybe l'll start writing Sports.

08:10.339 --> 08:11.453
You in a locker room?

08:12.507 --> 08:15.044
- l can't picture it.
- l can.

08:18.553 --> 08:20.710
So in light of the fact
that l am fully prepared

08:20.888 --> 08:23.508
to pay for all my expenses,
l propose that l be allowed

08:23.681 --> 08:26.171
to drive Brandon's car
whenever he's not using it.

08:26.392 --> 08:28.134
l think that's fair, right, Dad?

08:28.310 --> 08:30.551
- Well, l--
- Great, then it's settled.

08:30.728 --> 08:32.719
You guys can tell Brandon
as soon as he gets home.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.770
lt sounds like a reasonable request.

08:35.940 --> 08:37.682
That's because
you've never driven with her.

08:37.857 --> 08:39.434
- Cindy.
- All l'm saying is,

08:39.609 --> 08:41.565
you might wanna take
a spin around the block

08:41.735 --> 08:42.897
before you agree to anything.

08:43.070 --> 08:45.108
She'll never get the confidence
to be a good driver

08:45.279 --> 08:47.436
if she doesn't think we trust her.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.024
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

08:49.199 --> 08:51.949
- Are you getting a cold?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

08:52.743 --> 08:54.070
Hi, guys, sorry l'm late.

08:54.744 --> 08:55.774
lt's okay.

08:58.497 --> 09:02.363
So, Brandon, Mom, Dad
and l have decided

09:02.541 --> 09:06.667
that when you're not using your car,
l should be allowed to use it.

09:06.836 --> 09:10.453
- Okay.
- Before you give me your answer--

09:10.630 --> 09:12.289
Did you say okay?

09:12.464 --> 09:14.539
Yeah, l mean, as long as you pay
for repairs

09:14.716 --> 09:18.048
and l don't have to ride with you,
why should l care?

09:18.218 --> 09:21.550
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
l'm gonna go call Kelly.

09:21.721 --> 09:25.420
No, Donna. l'll call Dylan.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.675
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yup. Sure enough.

09:28.851 --> 09:32.016
And l got a new pair
of track shoes to prove it.

09:35.647 --> 09:39.264
Brandon. Coach has you running
the second leg of the 440.

09:39.441 --> 09:42.357
- Yeah, l know.
- That was my position.

09:42.526 --> 09:45.360
- Look, Steve, l'm sorry, l--
- Hey, way to go, Walsh.

09:45.529 --> 09:48.813
- Relay team never looked better, man.
- Thanks a lot, Conner.

09:49.448 --> 09:51.523
Don't worry. He cools down quick.

09:51.699 --> 09:54.189
Don't even tell me you're trying out
for the track team too?

09:54.368 --> 09:57.284
No, man, it's them organized sports.
They're too competitive for me.

09:57.453 --> 10:00.369
- Spoken like a true surfer boy.
- Yeah.

10:00.539 --> 10:02.696
l can't believe
you caved on me, man.

10:02.874 --> 10:06.952
- You were my last line of defence.
- What are you talking about?

10:07.126 --> 10:09.746
lf you're gonna let Brenda drive
your 'Stang, that's one thing,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.161
but sooner or later,
she's gonna wanna drive my Porsche,

10:12.338 --> 10:14.495
and l don't think
the relationship is that strong.

10:14.673 --> 10:19.629
Dylan, in defence of Brenda,
she's not that bad a driver.

10:31.310 --> 10:33.930
David, what are you doing?

10:34.103 --> 10:37.969
- l'm changing the station.
- No, go back, l love that song.

10:38.147 --> 10:40.719
- But you like this song too.
- No, l hate this song.

10:40.899 --> 10:42.725
Just put on your seat belt
and shut up, David.

10:42.901 --> 10:46.351
- l just wanna put on one song--
- Would you two cool it?

10:48.946 --> 10:50.404
Green light.

10:56.535 --> 10:57.815
Oh, my God.

10:57.994 --> 11:01.159
Oh, my God.
Tell me this isn't happening.

11:01.330 --> 11:02.657
This isn't happening.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.288
Donna, what am l gonna do?

11:08.460 --> 11:09.740
You better go talk to her.

11:18.383 --> 11:20.090
l am so sorry.

11:20.259 --> 11:22.962
l didn't think my car was moving,
and suddenly...

11:23.136 --> 11:24.677
- Well, it was too late.
- Don't worry.

11:24.846 --> 11:26.339
lt'll be all right.

11:26.555 --> 11:29.092
l want you to know right up front
that this was all my fault.

11:29.265 --> 11:31.470
l mean, completely my fault.

11:32.434 --> 11:34.840
l guess we're supposed to report it
to the insurance company

11:35.019 --> 11:36.477
or the police or something?

11:36.687 --> 11:39.093
Oh, well, l don't think that
that'll be necessary.

11:39.272 --> 11:40.896
- Really?
- Why should we?

11:41.065 --> 11:44.479
l mean, my bumper isn't damaged,
and your car just has that little ding.

11:44.943 --> 11:46.816
Well, it's my brother's car.

11:47.027 --> 11:49.599
l'll bet he doesn't even notice.

11:50.155 --> 11:52.561
- Thanks for being so understanding.
- Oh, please.

11:52.781 --> 11:55.187
Although l suppose
we should exchange phone numbers

11:55.366 --> 11:58.899
in case either one of us
wind up in traction.

11:59.077 --> 12:01.282
- l'll get a pen.
- Okay.

12:09.459 --> 12:10.739
Pump it up, Burke.

12:10.919 --> 12:13.409
- Learn from the master.
- The power broker.

12:13.587 --> 12:16.255
- Listen to you guys.
- Aren't you impressed?

12:16.422 --> 12:18.413
Yeah, l'm impressed.
Are you gonna do another set?

12:18.591 --> 12:19.918
- lt's all yours, Walsh.
- Thanks.

12:20.092 --> 12:24.302
Although, l don't know. lt's a mighty big
machine for such a little tyke like you.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.212
Gosh, you're right, Burke.

12:26.387 --> 12:29.137
l guess l should go in the bathroom
and pump myself full of steroids

12:29.306 --> 12:32.508
so l can grow up to be
a big, bad lug like you.

12:39.313 --> 12:44.020
Let's go, ladies.
We got a rendezvous with destiny.

12:50.154 --> 12:51.944
We being set up here, Sanders?

12:52.113 --> 12:54.188
Because if we are,
you better come clean right now.

12:54.365 --> 12:55.443
What are you talking about?

12:56.700 --> 12:59.534
- Well, guess.
- Tony, he's not with the programme.

13:00.827 --> 13:02.404
l haven't had a chance
to talk to him.

13:05.831 --> 13:07.739
Look, Steve.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.582
ln sports, winning isn't everything,

13:10.751 --> 13:13.916
it's the only thing, right? They don't
give scholarships for coming in fourth.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.330
Tell me something l don't know.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.832
So when Beverly kicked our butts
this year, the people in this room

13:19.006 --> 13:21.674
vowed we had way too much pride
to ever let that happen again.

13:21.883 --> 13:24.551
And that's when we formed
the Power Pack.

13:24.719 --> 13:26.794
Kyle, how many seconds
you shave off your two-mile

13:26.970 --> 13:28.214
since you joined the programme?

13:28.388 --> 13:29.585
About 20.

13:29.764 --> 13:31.637
l'm ahead of my personal best
by almost a foot.

13:31.849 --> 13:34.635
And we can thank
mother's little helper for that.

13:37.060 --> 13:40.059
- You guys are doing steroids?
- lt's not what you think.

13:40.229 --> 13:42.517
This is pure pharmaceutical quality.

13:42.731 --> 13:44.557
Controlled doses designed to peak
in mid-May

13:44.732 --> 13:46.640
for the state relays in Sacramento.

13:46.817 --> 13:49.485
And then it's over,
except for the cheering.

13:49.694 --> 13:51.602
There's some real risk
with that stuff.

13:51.820 --> 13:53.397
You talking about side effects?

13:54.322 --> 13:56.990
Look, man, we're not about
to take those kinds of chances.

13:57.157 --> 13:59.647
And if you stick with the programme,
you can't get hurt.

13:59.867 --> 14:02.783
With extra kick in your stride,
you could be anchoring the relay team.

14:04.245 --> 14:05.904
That's what you want,
isn't it, Sanders?

14:10.208 --> 14:12.532
l just wanna letter in something
before l graduate.

14:12.751 --> 14:15.834
So do you wanna get
with the programme?

14:17.671 --> 14:19.330
Oh, hell, l'll try anything once.

14:19.756 --> 14:24.131
All right. The Power Pack.

14:24.968 --> 14:27.125
All right, what are we gonna do
about Walsh?

14:27.303 --> 14:30.505
Brandon's cool. You know, he just
wants a letter, same as me.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.387
Trust that guy
about as far as l can spit.

14:32.556 --> 14:34.797
Sanders can talk to him,
get him to join the programme.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.264
Well, yeah. l'll talk to him.

14:37.435 --> 14:41.052
You just be careful. lf anybody finds
out about this, we're all off the team.

14:41.229 --> 14:43.600
- Kicked out of school.
- Kiss our scholarships goodbye.

14:43.772 --> 14:46.262
Gentlemen, let's not
get paranoid, okay?

14:46.441 --> 14:49.310
The candy man is here.

15:02.326 --> 15:06.108
Donna, what am l gonna do?
What am l gonna say?

15:06.287 --> 15:07.614
Bren, it's just a little ding.

15:07.789 --> 15:10.160
- l'm sure he'll never notice.
- You don't know my brother.

15:10.332 --> 15:13.746
l mean, he is completely anal
when it comes to his car.

15:13.918 --> 15:18.910
He will see it. He will torture me.
He will enjoy torturing me.

15:19.088 --> 15:21.625
Well, then don't say anything,
and when he asks you about it,

15:21.798 --> 15:24.548
play dumb, pretend you don't know
what he's talking about.

15:24.717 --> 15:25.831
That's not gonna work.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.668
Why not? You're a great actress.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.254
Yeah, on-stage in summer school.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.301
But in real life,
l am the world's worst liar,

15:31.471 --> 15:33.213
especially when it comes
to Brandon.

15:33.431 --> 15:35.802
But, Brenda, he's never gonna let you
drive his car again.

15:36.016 --> 15:37.675
Right now, l don't wanna drive
any car.

15:38.142 --> 15:40.845
Bren, don't be like that.
You're a good driver.

15:42.896 --> 15:44.555
Well, you're improving.

15:45.731 --> 15:47.853
Oh, God. The torture begins.

15:49.483 --> 15:51.521
Hi, Brandon.

15:52.110 --> 15:54.860
Brenda, just the person
l've been looking for.

15:55.029 --> 15:56.487
l saw the car out in the driveway.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.528
- Yeah, look, l'm really--
- Congratulations.

15:58.990 --> 16:01.562
You defied a basic law of nature.
You got it back in one piece.

16:01.742 --> 16:04.066
l even called Ripley's,
and they don't believe it either.

16:04.243 --> 16:06.649
- Wait, Brandon, about the car--
- Sorry, Bren, no can do.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.408
- Excuse me?
- Let me guess.

16:09.580 --> 16:12.449
You wanna know if you can drive me
to the Pit so you can have the car.

16:15.793 --> 16:17.073
How'd you know?

16:17.502 --> 16:20.170
Hey, l can read you like a book, sis.

16:20.338 --> 16:23.124
- See you later, Donna.
- Bye, Brandon.

16:26.258 --> 16:29.376
l was going to tell him, l really was.

16:30.011 --> 16:31.919
l don't blame you.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.342
- Where you going?
- To bed.

16:47.356 --> 16:49.146
Okay, if you insist, l'll join you.

16:49.357 --> 16:50.815
Nice try.

16:51.025 --> 16:52.483
Why don't you stay here
and join me?

16:52.693 --> 16:55.265
Sorry. l'm getting up at 6
to run with Kyle.

16:56.779 --> 16:59.529
You guys are doing it, aren't you?

16:59.698 --> 17:03.445
Steve, why is it that every time l try
to give you the benefit of the doubt,

17:03.617 --> 17:04.861
you always manage to remind me

17:05.035 --> 17:07.026
why it is l broke up with you
in the first place?

17:11.289 --> 17:13.115
Well, that seemed very cordial.

17:13.290 --> 17:14.534
Yeah, really?

17:14.708 --> 17:17.114
She always seems to bring out
the best in me anyway.

17:17.292 --> 17:19.000
So, what'll it be, buddy?
Peach pie?

17:19.169 --> 17:20.746
- Chocolate shake?
- No way.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.497
l'm in training, just like you, man.

17:22.672 --> 17:25.506
Even though Chapman thinks
l'm an expendable item, l don't care.

17:25.674 --> 17:29.752
Listen, l didn't mean
to ace you out of anything.

17:30.510 --> 17:33.000
The season's young, so be warned.

17:33.179 --> 17:36.381
Come this time next May,
you'll be eating my dust.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.464
Steve, get real.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.095
Nobody from West Beverly
is gonna make the state finals.

17:42.143 --> 17:43.553
What about Cahill?

17:43.769 --> 17:46.887
He's a long shot, but maybe.

17:47.063 --> 17:49.434
l wish l knew what it was about me
that gets him so jacked.

17:49.648 --> 17:51.521
Well, that's what you get
for being a reporter.

17:51.691 --> 17:54.477
But l'm not anymore. l'm right there
in the trenches with the team.

17:55.069 --> 17:58.816
Give it time. You just got to get
with the programme.

17:58.988 --> 18:01.656
l'm trying, but you saw what
happened today in the weight room.

18:01.865 --> 18:03.691
l make one little joke
about anabolic steroids

18:03.866 --> 18:06.023
and Cahill and Miller
are shooting me the stink eye.

18:06.201 --> 18:08.239
Steroids are something
you should never joke about.

18:08.453 --> 18:09.483
Why not?

18:10.621 --> 18:13.739
l mean, unless you're getting tweaked
on the stuff, what's the big deal?

18:13.915 --> 18:17.247
The big deal is that steroids
are a serious business.

18:17.417 --> 18:18.531
Are you kidding?

18:18.751 --> 18:20.328
Steroids are
a very dangerous business.

18:20.502 --> 18:22.790
Haven't you read
any of the horror stories?

18:23.421 --> 18:25.578
Look, there's a downside
to everything.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.000
lf you use it in a limited way,

18:27.174 --> 18:29.331
all they do is give you
a little competitive edge.

18:30.092 --> 18:32.416
Steve, don't take this the wrong way,

18:32.594 --> 18:35.843
but that's about the stupidest thing
you ever said to me.

18:36.013 --> 18:39.048
They're hormones, man.
They make you irrational and violent.

18:39.223 --> 18:41.013
They cause liver disease
and sterility.

18:41.183 --> 18:44.182
Right. And you know all there is
to know about everything, right?

18:44.352 --> 18:46.842
lt's no wonder those guys
don't like you.

18:47.062 --> 18:48.639
Steve.

19:06.492 --> 19:09.064
- Hi, thanks for coming.
- No problem.

19:11.412 --> 19:12.786
Are you okay?

19:12.955 --> 19:14.532
You look like you lost
your best friend.

19:14.706 --> 19:16.911
Believe me, it might come to that.

19:17.082 --> 19:18.908
You want anything? Soda? Pie?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.960
No, l'm fine. So, what's going on?

19:23.086 --> 19:25.623
Suppose l came to you
with an article

19:25.797 --> 19:29.164
documenting steroid use in the
athletic department, would you run it?

19:29.633 --> 19:32.004
Are you kidding? Of course l would.

19:32.801 --> 19:34.378
Do you have something
you wanna show me?

19:34.594 --> 19:37.297
No, no, no. lt's not a story yet.
lt's just a hunch.

19:38.597 --> 19:40.838
Does that mean
you're back on the paper?

19:41.015 --> 19:42.295
Did l ever leave?

19:43.434 --> 19:48.308
Well, on behalf of the editorial board,
you can still be on the team.

19:48.479 --> 19:49.937
Yeah, l can see it now:

19:50.105 --> 19:53.140
''Excuse me, l'm writing an expose
that could potentially ruin your life.

19:53.315 --> 19:56.433
Can you pass me the baton
and be my friend?''

19:57.401 --> 19:59.227
So much for being
just one of the guys.

19:59.403 --> 20:00.517
Look, l know how you feel.

20:00.695 --> 20:03.185
l had to go undercover to break
the story on the cafeteria.

20:04.073 --> 20:06.907
So, what's it like to keep secrets
from your friends?

20:09.701 --> 20:12.451
l can't think of anything else
that can make you feel so alone.

20:17.582 --> 20:20.154
l can't believe you run
six miles every morning.

20:20.334 --> 20:22.824
Yeah, and 1 2 on weekends.

20:23.002 --> 20:25.836
Loneliness-of-a-long-distance-runner
kind of thing.

20:26.004 --> 20:28.079
You know how it is, right, Kel?

20:35.802 --> 20:39.419
- Okay, what do you say?
- Thank God.

20:39.597 --> 20:41.304
Hey, you did good.

20:41.473 --> 20:45.136
- l'm sorry if l slowed you down.
- No.

20:45.309 --> 20:47.715
No, it's just nice being with you, Kel.

20:47.894 --> 20:52.056
Not having to impress anybody.
Just being myself, you know?

20:53.981 --> 20:55.688
Come on.

21:05.656 --> 21:07.030
Hey, Burke. How's it going?

21:07.199 --> 21:09.404
You tell me. Did you talk to Walsh?

21:09.575 --> 21:13.571
- Yeah, l did.
- So?

21:13.786 --> 21:16.027
Well, l wouldn't exactly count on him
for the programme.

21:16.205 --> 21:18.742
But you definitely have nothing
to worry about.

21:18.915 --> 21:21.156
Look, l know Brandon
a lot better than you do.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.241
He's a great guy.
You can trust him, l swear.

21:23.418 --> 21:25.872
Steve, what exactly did you tell him
about the programme?

21:26.086 --> 21:28.623
Nothing. l didn't say a word.

21:28.838 --> 21:31.292
Good. What do you say
we keep it that way, okay?

21:31.507 --> 21:33.415
No problem.

21:39.012 --> 21:40.174
One more. Come on, buddy.

21:40.346 --> 21:41.839
Push it, push it, push it, push it.

21:42.014 --> 21:44.052
You got it. Good, man.

21:52.104 --> 21:54.428
- Hey, Steve.
- Hey, Brandon.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.353
All right, Brandon, now you give me
ten big ones, man.

21:57.524 --> 22:00.192
- Third set.
- All right.

22:00.568 --> 22:01.598
You got it?

22:04.404 --> 22:05.434
One.

22:07.448 --> 22:09.486
Two.

22:09.658 --> 22:11.696
Three. Keep them even.

22:11.867 --> 22:13.277
Four.

22:14.369 --> 22:16.610
Five. Steady.

22:16.829 --> 22:18.867
Six. Come on, you got it.

22:19.039 --> 22:21.992
All right, Big B, you got it.

22:24.126 --> 22:27.125
Oh, man, that was really weak.

22:27.295 --> 22:28.954
You're working hard.
lt'll happen for you.

22:29.129 --> 22:32.128
Yeah, l just wish there was a way
to make it happen sooner than later.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.750
Slow and steady wins the race.

22:33.966 --> 22:36.254
Steady may win,
but slow loses every time.

22:36.884 --> 22:37.914
l hear you.

22:38.094 --> 22:40.335
ls there anything you recommend
to boost my performance?

22:40.512 --> 22:42.254
Kick me into high gear?

22:44.932 --> 22:46.010
Sure.

22:46.182 --> 22:47.889
Eat right, get plenty of rest,

22:48.059 --> 22:52.766
and once every day,
down a gallon of Geritol.

22:53.938 --> 22:56.179
l always wondered what
the secret of your success was.

22:56.398 --> 22:59.314
There's no secrets on this team.
And there's no shortcuts either.

22:59.483 --> 23:02.233
- What do l always say, Tony?
- No pain, no gain.

23:02.402 --> 23:03.599
See?

23:03.778 --> 23:07.276
lf you were writing an article for the
paper, you could quote me on that.

23:17.078 --> 23:18.904
From the three-point line.

23:21.206 --> 23:23.530
See that? l should've gone out
for the basketball team.

23:23.750 --> 23:26.584
Gee, l thought you went out
for that team last year.

23:26.752 --> 23:29.372
Gee, l thought you valued your life.

23:30.421 --> 23:33.871
Oh, if that's Keifer Sutherland,
tell him that l'm a little busy.

23:35.966 --> 23:37.874
Hello, Keifer?

23:38.718 --> 23:42.299
No, ma'am, you dialled correctly.

23:42.471 --> 23:44.427
Who would you like to speak to?

23:46.015 --> 23:48.303
Yeah, just a minute, please.

23:49.100 --> 23:51.506
lt's for Brenda Walsh's father.

23:52.602 --> 23:54.973
Hello, Jim Walsh here.

23:55.146 --> 23:57.387
Yes, l'm Brenda's father.

23:58.940 --> 24:00.730
Accident? What accident?

24:01.942 --> 24:03.732
The real reason l didn't say anything

24:03.902 --> 24:06.855
is because since everyone
already thinks l'm such a lousy driver--

24:07.071 --> 24:08.730
Which you've just proved in spades.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.737
Look, l didn't prove anything.

24:10.906 --> 24:13.111
Why do you think they call it
an accident, Brandon?

24:13.325 --> 24:15.731
- l don't know, Bren. You're the expert.
- Brandon.

24:15.910 --> 24:17.818
Dad, do you see
what l'm talking about?

24:17.995 --> 24:20.911
Brenda, it's Brandon's car
and it's carried on my insurance.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.652
So you had an obligation to both of us
to tell us what happened.

24:23.874 --> 24:25.533
Look, l know. l'm sorry.

24:25.708 --> 24:26.952
l should've, and l would've,

24:27.126 --> 24:29.450
but it practically didn't even seem
like a real accident.

24:29.669 --> 24:33.416
Brenda, this poor woman is describing
a very serious case of whiplash.

24:33.630 --> 24:35.668
lt certainly didn't seem
like that at the time.

24:35.882 --> 24:38.004
Whiplash can take a while
to show up.

24:39.634 --> 24:43.167
lf that's Keifer, l'll just tell him to take
his car straight over to the body shop.

24:45.638 --> 24:47.380
Hello.

24:48.557 --> 24:50.513
Yeah, how you doing?

24:57.897 --> 24:59.770
Well, how about tonight?

25:19.745 --> 25:22.910
Hey, man. How you doing?

25:24.248 --> 25:26.038
Come on, let's walk. lt's freezing.

25:26.207 --> 25:27.748
Sure.

25:32.086 --> 25:34.374
Why are we being so secretive?

25:34.546 --> 25:37.000
Believe me, Brandon,
l don't like keeping secrets.

25:37.173 --> 25:38.797
That's kind of why l'm here.

25:38.966 --> 25:41.634
l heard what you were asking
about today in the weight room.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.508
About improving your performance
and stuff?

25:43.678 --> 25:44.708
Yeah?

25:44.887 --> 25:46.297
l know what you were getting at.

25:46.471 --> 25:49.043
You wanna know where
you could score some steroids, right?

25:49.223 --> 25:50.597
Yeah.

25:51.641 --> 25:54.047
Come on, you don't really
wanna get into that stuff, do you?

25:54.226 --> 25:55.803
l just want a little competitive edge.

25:55.978 --> 25:59.760
No, what you're really doing
is an article for the Blaze, right?

26:01.398 --> 26:02.595
How'd you figure that out?

26:02.774 --> 26:04.018
l'm good at reading people,

26:04.192 --> 26:05.934
especially when they got
a secret to hide.

26:06.110 --> 26:07.140
So, what are you saying?

26:07.319 --> 26:10.069
Are you telling me that no one
on the track team is doing steroids?

26:11.530 --> 26:13.771
No, l'm telling you a lot of people
are taking them.

26:15.157 --> 26:18.073
Things are out of control. lt's gotta
stop before someone gets hurt.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.486
So are you willing
to talk to me about it?

26:23.621 --> 26:24.948
Brandon,
l'm not gonna name names.

26:25.122 --> 26:26.781
And you gotta keep my name
out of it too.

26:26.957 --> 26:29.245
No one will ever know we talked.
l give you my word.

26:32.377 --> 26:34.452
Okay. What do you wanna know?

26:47.221 --> 26:49.343
So, Bren,
did you get grounded or what?

26:49.514 --> 26:52.004
Well, not exactly. My dad
was pretty cool about the accident,

26:52.182 --> 26:54.257
although he did say
it would be in the best interest

26:54.434 --> 26:57.599
if l didn't drive again
until hell freezes over.

26:57.770 --> 27:01.433
Wow, that would take a long time.

27:02.106 --> 27:03.647
Psych.

27:04.733 --> 27:06.724
Hello, young sibling.

27:07.484 --> 27:09.522
- Brandon.
- Yeah, Steve. What's up?

27:09.694 --> 27:11.484
Look, l just wanna say l'm sorry

27:11.654 --> 27:13.692
for what happened the other night
at the Peach Pit.

27:13.864 --> 27:15.939
- l don't know what came over me.
- Forget about it.

27:16.115 --> 27:18.949
No, l really been thinking about this,
and you're my best friend, man.

27:19.117 --> 27:21.785
l just didn't wanna get caught up
in the middle of you and Burke.

27:21.953 --> 27:23.577
l wish it could be
the way things were

27:23.745 --> 27:26.317
before we got into this
competitive stuff.

27:28.791 --> 27:31.494
- You going down to the gym?
- Yeah.

27:31.667 --> 27:34.121
All right, l'll see you there.

27:47.261 --> 27:49.585
Hey. l was just rereading
your piece, Brandon.

27:49.763 --> 27:51.838
l gotta tell you,
you have some incredible stuff.

27:52.015 --> 27:54.137
Especially the part
where your source describes

27:54.308 --> 27:57.592
the pressures of trying to be accepted
by the other guys, it really...

27:57.769 --> 27:59.096
Look, Andrea.

27:59.270 --> 28:01.558
l'm having second thoughts
about running the article.

28:03.356 --> 28:04.849
lt's a little late, don't you think?

28:05.023 --> 28:07.145
We have to be in Chapman's office
in five minutes.

28:07.317 --> 28:08.894
Yeah, l know.

28:09.068 --> 28:11.059
You wanted to show him
the piece and get a quote,

28:11.236 --> 28:12.813
as long as we didn't reveal
your source.

28:12.987 --> 28:15.773
l know what l said, Andrea. But--

28:16.406 --> 28:19.192
There's this guy on the team
that l'm pretty sure is involved,

28:19.366 --> 28:23.907
on the fringes, if at all, and l just don't
wanna see him get busted, that's all.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.109
l can barely look at myself
in the mirror as it is.

28:29.373 --> 28:32.538
Look, would it help

28:32.709 --> 28:36.575
if l were to be the point person
on the story from here on out?

28:38.087 --> 28:39.913
The thought has crossed my mind.

28:40.964 --> 28:43.418
Whatever you want's okay with me.

28:44.634 --> 28:46.341
Thanks.

28:53.223 --> 28:55.713
l was beginning
to give up on you, man.

28:55.891 --> 28:57.799
l hope you ate your Wheaties.
Chapman's timing.

28:57.976 --> 29:01.639
Look, you didn't hear it from me,
but the Blaze is publishing an article

29:01.812 --> 29:03.768
about steroid use
in the athletic department.

29:03.938 --> 29:04.968
Oh, my God.

29:05.147 --> 29:07.684
lf you got any 'roids in your locker,
l suggest you ditch them.

29:07.858 --> 29:10.774
- Man, l don't believe you.
- Just do it, Steve.

29:24.911 --> 29:26.108
Believe me, gentlemen,

29:27.329 --> 29:30.245
if l had the resources at my disposal,
each and every one of you

29:30.456 --> 29:32.282
would be standing in line
in the bathroom

29:32.458 --> 29:34.248
with a plastic cup in your hand.

29:36.169 --> 29:38.540
But testing for steroids
is not a practical option

29:38.754 --> 29:40.544
and it's not going to
solve the problem,

29:40.713 --> 29:43.084
if there is indeed a problem.

29:43.298 --> 29:45.289
Judging from what Andrea
has showed me,

29:45.466 --> 29:49.379
we indeed do have a problem
on our hands, don't we, gentlemen?

29:54.431 --> 29:57.181
Now, until the rest who are using it--
And you know who you are.

30:00.185 --> 30:04.726
Until you come forward
to stop this recklessness,

30:06.022 --> 30:10.481
there will be no practise today,
or tomorrow or the day after that.

30:10.692 --> 30:13.691
And if we have to forfeit
the whole season, so be it.

30:18.864 --> 30:21.817
l will be in my office
the rest of the day.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.323
You're a dead man, Sanders.

30:36.501 --> 30:37.615
- lt wasn't me.
- Prove it.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.248
- You prove it.
- Hey, both of you, shut up, okay?

30:40.420 --> 30:42.079
Chapman's not gonna forfeit
a whole season

30:42.255 --> 30:43.796
trying to prove a point
he can't prove.

30:43.964 --> 30:46.501
So as long as we keep cool,
we got nothing to worry about.

30:46.675 --> 30:48.880
- Or do we?
- No.

30:49.051 --> 30:51.256
l hope you're telling the truth.

30:51.803 --> 30:54.672
Tell your friend Walsh
he better watch his back.

30:57.557 --> 31:00.426
Kyle, l didn't tell anybody,
you gotta believe me.

31:00.934 --> 31:01.964
Kyle, let's go.

31:18.321 --> 31:20.194
l should've bought her
the other flowers.

31:20.364 --> 31:22.735
Bren, these are beautiful.
Besides, the bigger basket?

31:22.907 --> 31:25.397
The florist said they were
more appropriate for a funeral.

31:25.576 --> 31:28.778
Yeah, well, you didn't hear
what she sounded like on the phone.

31:32.080 --> 31:36.325
- Oh, God.
- You were so sweet to bring these.

31:36.500 --> 31:39.867
Oh, thank you. Come in, please.

31:45.006 --> 31:47.756
- l'm Rosemary Winters.
- Dylan McKay.

31:47.924 --> 31:50.840
- Sorry about everything.
- Well, these things happen.

31:51.010 --> 31:54.045
l just wish they'd stop
happening to me.

31:59.682 --> 32:00.796
l feel so awful.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.591
l know you do, sweetie.

32:04.894 --> 32:06.138
Can l get you kids anything?

32:06.520 --> 32:07.800
l'm fine, thanks.

32:07.980 --> 32:09.307
No, we just came to
drop these off

32:09.481 --> 32:11.519
and see if there's anything
that we can do for you.

32:11.691 --> 32:14.940
Well, that depends on how much
influence you have with your father.

32:15.151 --> 32:17.308
- What do you mean?
- Well, with a lawsuit pending,

32:17.486 --> 32:19.394
l've been advised
not to say anything.

32:19.613 --> 32:21.237
Lawsuit? What lawsuit?

32:21.447 --> 32:24.814
Don't worry about it.
lt sounds worse than it is.

32:24.991 --> 32:27.907
Although, with the insurance
companies involved,

32:28.077 --> 32:31.112
l don't know how that's going to affect
your driving record.

32:31.287 --> 32:32.365
What are you talking about?

32:32.538 --> 32:34.862
l'm sorry, Brenda.
l shouldn't be saying anything.

32:35.081 --> 32:37.487
Rosemary, please.
You've got to tell me what's going on.

32:37.708 --> 32:40.458
When l called your father,

32:40.627 --> 32:44.670
l was hoping
that we could solve this privately.

32:44.838 --> 32:48.916
With a modest amount that would
basically pay for my physical therapy

32:49.091 --> 32:52.838
and a small amount
for my pain and suffering.

32:53.052 --> 32:55.886
Well, he should pay you. l mean,
he knows the accident was my fault.

32:56.096 --> 32:57.637
Well, l would've thought that,

32:57.805 --> 33:00.377
but he insists on going through
his insurance company,

33:00.557 --> 33:03.971
and that really doesn't leave me
with any choice but to--

33:05.894 --> 33:07.435
You okay?

33:07.645 --> 33:12.305
lt's just a small spasm. lt'll pass.

33:12.940 --> 33:14.433
l've gotta talk to my dad.

33:15.234 --> 33:18.851
Brenda, l don't want you
to get into any trouble on my account.

33:19.070 --> 33:21.904
No, it's okay.
Look, my dad and l are very close.

33:22.072 --> 33:23.731
And once he knows the facts,

33:23.906 --> 33:25.814
you'll see what a different person
he'll become.

33:25.991 --> 33:28.066
l can't believe that
you are standing up for a woman

33:28.242 --> 33:30.566
who is threatening to bring
a $1 million claim against us!

33:30.744 --> 33:32.154
That's highway robbery.

33:32.329 --> 33:35.862
l can't believe you would use insurance
to get out of paying what we owe her.

33:36.540 --> 33:38.864
Brenda, that is not the way
the insurance companies work.

33:39.041 --> 33:41.613
Oh, that's right, Dad. They just rip off
poor defenceless women

33:41.793 --> 33:43.619
who they won't even insure
in the first place.

33:43.795 --> 33:46.794
ls that what she told you?
Because that's absolutely ridiculous.

33:46.963 --> 33:48.622
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.499
Dad, you taught us
to be compassionate.

33:50.674 --> 33:53.709
To tell the truth and take responsibility
for our actions.

33:53.885 --> 33:55.960
lf you wanna take responsibility
for something,

33:56.220 --> 33:57.761
let's remember who hit what car

33:57.929 --> 34:00.300
and then kept it a secret
from the rest of the family.

34:00.514 --> 34:02.304
Let's take responsibility for that.

34:02.849 --> 34:04.924
When are you gonna understand
that there are things

34:05.101 --> 34:07.092
that you don't have the experience
to handle yet?

34:07.894 --> 34:08.972
You mean like driving.

34:09.896 --> 34:11.058
Oh, honey.

34:13.273 --> 34:15.763
- You guys sitting this one out, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.103
Brenda driving,

34:17.275 --> 34:18.983
it's not really
a great subject right now.

34:19.152 --> 34:21.060
Especially when your father's sick.

34:21.237 --> 34:23.608
Well, goodbye and good luck.

34:23.780 --> 34:24.858
Listen, man, you working?

34:25.031 --> 34:26.405
Yeah, it's Thursday.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.367
How's life in the fast lane going?
You know, track team. ls it fun?

34:30.534 --> 34:31.993
ls it what you expected?

34:32.161 --> 34:35.196
Fun's not a word
that comes to mind.

34:35.371 --> 34:38.074
Let's just say
it's not what l expected.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.717
Sweet-tooth time
at the Taylor house, huh?

34:58.887 --> 35:01.211
Yeah, it's true.
My mom's been on a rampage lately.

35:01.389 --> 35:03.926
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.

35:08.644 --> 35:10.018
Brandon.

35:10.186 --> 35:12.261
Steve, what are you doing here
in the Peach Pit?

35:12.438 --> 35:15.603
- We gotta talk.
- lt's just not a good time.

35:15.774 --> 35:17.516
Brandon, time is running out
for both of us.

35:17.692 --> 35:20.264
l don't know about you, but l don't
wanna get my face kicked in.

35:20.735 --> 35:24.601
- By who? Miller? Burke?
- You never stop being a reporter.

35:24.780 --> 35:27.186
When you told everyone you quit,
that was just bull, huh?

35:27.365 --> 35:31.195
No, Steve, that was the truth. l wanted
to be on the team more than anything.

35:31.367 --> 35:33.405
But when l started seeing
my friend's personality

35:33.577 --> 35:34.951
starting to change before my eyes,

35:35.120 --> 35:37.444
l thought he'd gotten into something
he didn't understand.

35:37.622 --> 35:41.036
So l asked a few questions.
And, hey, Ma, lookie what l found.

35:48.879 --> 35:50.752
How deep are you into it?

35:53.341 --> 35:57.171
l just started a cycle. lt's no biggie.

35:59.011 --> 36:00.837
When l read the pamphlet
the coach handed out,

36:01.013 --> 36:02.886
l decided it definitely wasn't worth it.

36:03.431 --> 36:06.134
- l tried to tell you that.
- l know, and l appreciate that.

36:06.308 --> 36:10.007
But what l have to do now is prove
that l'm not the guy who blabbed.

36:11.853 --> 36:13.394
That's not gonna be easy, Steve.

36:13.563 --> 36:17.096
Sure it is. All we have to do is get
Andrea to write that l'm not the guy.

36:17.274 --> 36:20.227
- lt won't work.
- Come on, of course it's gonna work.

36:20.401 --> 36:22.855
She's in love with you.
She'll do anything you ask her to.

36:23.027 --> 36:25.232
Except compromise the identity
of a news source.

36:26.113 --> 36:27.939
Well, this isn't compromising
anything.

36:28.156 --> 36:29.982
l can't do it, Steve. l'm sorry.

36:30.199 --> 36:32.689
Then when you get right down to it,
what you're saying

36:32.867 --> 36:36.234
is that protecting a source is more
important than protecting your friend?

36:36.412 --> 36:40.029
No. l'm saying that l gave this guy
my word. l can't go back on that now.

36:40.206 --> 36:43.823
- Thanks a lot, Brandon.
- Steve, come--

36:44.000 --> 36:48.577
That's it. From here on in, for now
and forever, you're on your own.

36:54.757 --> 36:57.673
We ordered pecan
and they gave us boysenberry.

37:15.396 --> 37:17.684
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.

37:17.856 --> 37:20.061
l warned you exercise
could be habit-forming.

37:20.233 --> 37:21.430
l'm not gonna run today.

37:21.651 --> 37:23.393
What, you got up early
to keep me company?

37:24.069 --> 37:27.187
No, actually,
l was hoping maybe you could

37:27.363 --> 37:29.354
explain to me what's going on
with the track team.

37:29.531 --> 37:31.238
There are all these rumours
floating around

37:31.407 --> 37:33.445
and l just wanted to get
the real story.

37:33.617 --> 37:35.905
Well, it's hard to say.
What do you hear?

37:36.119 --> 37:37.945
Well, l don't know
if this is right or not,

37:38.120 --> 37:40.526
but l guess some of the guys
on the team are accusing Steve

37:40.705 --> 37:43.408
of helping Andrea write
some article about steroids.

37:43.624 --> 37:46.623
He's totally freaked out, because he
thinks these guys are gonna kill him.

37:46.793 --> 37:48.500
Yeah, l know all about it, Kel.

37:48.669 --> 37:50.246
What do you wanna know, exactly?

37:51.421 --> 37:52.998
Well, first of all,

37:53.172 --> 37:56.954
l don't understand why someone
would get involved with this stuff.

37:58.467 --> 38:00.873
There are a lot of reasons, l guess.

38:01.636 --> 38:04.042
Pump up, get a hard body,
get a competitive edge.

38:04.430 --> 38:05.592
lt depends.

38:05.764 --> 38:08.467
lf they work out every morning,
won't they get the same results?

38:08.682 --> 38:10.673
ln time, l guess. l don't know.

38:10.851 --> 38:13.008
- Look, l gotta run, Kel.
- lt's just...

38:13.185 --> 38:16.517
lf you could say anything to these guys
to help clear Steve's name,

38:16.688 --> 38:18.181
that would really mean a lot to me.

38:19.356 --> 38:20.933
l'll see what l can do.

38:21.149 --> 38:23.271
l know he's been cold to you
in the past,

38:23.442 --> 38:26.358
but it's just because he gets
so jealous sometimes, you know?

38:26.570 --> 38:28.645
Jealous? Are you sure
you got the right guy?

38:29.822 --> 38:31.612
Well, you lettered in football.

38:32.198 --> 38:35.612
No, seriously.
He knows how much l like you,

38:35.826 --> 38:37.983
and how much l respect you.

38:39.995 --> 38:41.654
Sure, Kel.

38:57.966 --> 38:59.673
lt's gonna cause me
great bodily damage--

38:59.842 --> 39:01.715
Your name is not even mentioned
in the article.

39:01.885 --> 39:04.719
l know, but it's kind of implied
that l'm the guy who talked to you...

39:04.887 --> 39:06.511
Hey, little big man.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.339
Did you understand
that Spanish homework?

39:09.182 --> 39:11.304
l don't suppose
l could compare it to mine.

39:11.475 --> 39:12.885
You don't mean copy it?

39:17.437 --> 39:22.227
Bren, your father was very explicit:
no more contact with Rosemary.

39:22.399 --> 39:23.857
Yeah, that's easy for him to say.

39:24.025 --> 39:26.313
He's not the one who caused her
to be immobilized.

39:26.485 --> 39:28.393
All right, fine.
You wanna go, you go.

39:28.570 --> 39:31.320
- l am not gonna be an accomplice.
- Fine. Be absurd.

39:31.489 --> 39:32.863
Don't drive me, l'll take the bus.

39:33.031 --> 39:35.106
Bren. Bren...

39:36.784 --> 39:39.321
Andrea, yes or no? Are you
gonna print my statement or not?

39:39.536 --> 39:41.907
Not until after we print our story,
which might not happen.

39:42.079 --> 39:43.656
l promised if somebody
comes forward--

39:43.830 --> 39:44.860
- Yeah.
- Steve.

39:45.039 --> 39:46.283
Hey, wanna go chew some nails?

39:46.457 --> 39:49.492
No, what l'd like to do is take Andrea
and stuff her down Brandon's throat.

39:49.667 --> 39:52.073
They're your friends, imagine
what you'd do to your enemies.

39:52.253 --> 39:53.415
No, they are not my friends.

39:53.587 --> 39:55.625
They're more interested
in putting a newspaper out.

39:55.797 --> 39:58.880
Wait, what's happening, man?
l've been a little out of the loop lately.

40:01.676 --> 40:05.174
lt's a long story. The bottom line
is they're organizing a witch hunt

40:05.345 --> 40:07.383
to find out who's doing steroids
on the track team.

40:07.596 --> 40:09.173
Steroids?

40:09.347 --> 40:11.006
That stuff will shrink
your gonads, man.

40:11.224 --> 40:12.338
Yeah, l know all about it.

40:12.558 --> 40:14.384
Okay, let's talk about Brandon
for a second.

40:14.559 --> 40:16.218
He's not exactly
a witch-hunt type of guy.

40:16.394 --> 40:18.884
And if you were in trouble,
he'd be there for you.

40:19.062 --> 40:20.092
Goes for me too.

40:21.939 --> 40:23.563
Thanks, man.

40:24.941 --> 40:26.600
Thanks.

40:56.963 --> 41:02.002
Yeah. My daughter actually saw her
aerobicizing in front of the TV.

41:02.175 --> 41:03.965
Thanks for everything, Ernie.

41:04.135 --> 41:06.755
Oh, yeah, l'm drinking lots of tea
and all that, you know.

41:06.928 --> 41:08.966
Thanks again. Bye.

41:09.972 --> 41:13.055
Turns out this poor defenceless
woman is a scam artist.

41:13.224 --> 41:15.262
She's claimed 1 4 accidents
in the last three years.

41:15.434 --> 41:17.722
That's why she wouldn't go
through my insurance company.

41:18.603 --> 41:20.760
She's even been convicted
of backing into another car

41:20.938 --> 41:22.929
to initiate a phoney claim.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.226
Well, then she might have
caused the accident, not me.

41:27.817 --> 41:29.191
She probably did.

41:29.694 --> 41:33.061
Well, then l'm not a bad driver,
l'm a good driver.

41:33.238 --> 41:34.980
Which there's no reason in the world

41:35.156 --> 41:36.863
why l shouldn't just
start driving again.

41:37.032 --> 41:39.356
Well, with your permission,
of course.

41:43.495 --> 41:45.154
God bless you.

41:45.329 --> 41:46.906
Thank you.

41:49.499 --> 41:51.537
Practise has been cancelled again.

41:51.709 --> 41:53.286
Damn it to hell.

41:53.460 --> 41:56.459
This is not gonna blow over, Cahill.
lt just isn't.

41:56.629 --> 41:59.119
Chapman is gonna take us
to the mat on this.

41:59.297 --> 42:01.087
Any bets?

42:01.257 --> 42:03.083
What are you gonna do?

42:07.469 --> 42:10.338
Sanders, you got a minute?

42:10.513 --> 42:13.382
- He's got a minute.
- Then let's take a walk.

42:21.395 --> 42:23.019
l can prove
l'm not the one who talked.

42:23.188 --> 42:26.022
lt's okay, we're way past that now.
What we need from you is a favour.

42:26.190 --> 42:28.514
- What kind of favour?
- You're a team player, aren't you?

42:28.692 --> 42:30.730
l mean, you want us to win
the league title, right?

42:30.902 --> 42:33.059
Here's the deal:
you tell Chapman you started dipping

42:33.237 --> 42:35.145
because of how much you wanted
to make the team.

42:35.321 --> 42:37.526
You did it yourself
and you're never gonna do it again.

42:37.698 --> 42:40.270
- What? You want me to take the fall?
- Somebody's gotta do it.

42:40.450 --> 42:42.572
- Chapman isn't gonna punish you.
- Neither will we.

42:42.743 --> 42:44.651
One way or another,
you're gonna take a fall.

42:44.828 --> 42:46.654
- No way!
- Oh, yeah. There is a way.

42:48.831 --> 42:49.993
Hey. Hey!

42:51.624 --> 42:52.904
- Get rid of him.
- Burke.

42:53.083 --> 42:55.288
- l'm warning you.
- Burke, leave him alone, all right?

42:55.502 --> 42:57.659
- Stay out of it, Conner.
- No, l mean it, man.

42:58.254 --> 43:00.080
l cracked.
l'm the one who told Brandon.

43:04.925 --> 43:06.632
lt's me, l'm the one you wanna kill.

43:07.260 --> 43:08.504
Don't blow this, Kyle.

43:09.595 --> 43:12.678
l can't keep living a lie, man.
And neither can you.

43:22.562 --> 43:23.676
So it was heavy?

43:23.896 --> 43:26.516
- Yeah, it was definitely intense.
- Sounds like it.

43:26.731 --> 43:30.063
Yeah, they went into Chapman's office
and closed the door for 45 minutes.

43:30.275 --> 43:32.847
- Then what happened?
- Well, l don't know, l left.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.769
What,
you're not gonna write about it?

43:35.571 --> 43:38.108
No, seriously, what do you guys
think is gonna happen to them?

43:38.656 --> 43:40.861
l don't think anyone will get
kicked out of school,

43:41.074 --> 43:42.816
but l don't think
we should expect too much

43:42.992 --> 43:44.319
from the track team this year.

43:44.493 --> 43:47.113
Well, actually, l heard the relay team
was pretty good.

43:48.621 --> 43:51.324
Well, l'm gonna go call Kyle.
l feel kind of bad for him.

43:51.540 --> 43:52.998
l think he'll be okay.

43:53.207 --> 43:55.163
Yeah, he'll be all right.

43:55.334 --> 43:57.409
- See you.
- Bye.

43:57.585 --> 44:01.118
Wait a minute. Don't leave.
We have an announcement to make.

44:02.714 --> 44:04.871
- Tell them.
- Today was a history-making event.

44:05.049 --> 44:06.708
Brenda Walsh drove
her first Porsche.

44:07.092 --> 44:09.498
- Look out.
- Surrender, Dorothy.

44:10.011 --> 44:13.010
Thank you. So in order to celebrate,
l would like the keys

44:13.179 --> 44:15.716
so l can take Donna
and David to the movies.

44:16.974 --> 44:18.052
My keys?

44:18.433 --> 44:19.463
Yes, please.

44:20.893 --> 44:22.055
To my car?

44:22.602 --> 44:23.846
Yes.

44:25.271 --> 44:28.354
l got a really bad feeling
about this one.

44:33.026 --> 44:34.270
D, can you give me
a ride home?

44:34.485 --> 44:35.943
Sure, man.

44:38.238 --> 44:41.107
Let's not forget what happened
last time, now, okay?

44:47.119 --> 44:48.529
So did she grind the gears?

44:49.037 --> 44:51.075
Every time.

44:51.289 --> 44:52.367
l had a feeling.
