16:45.605 --> 16:47.740
No!
No!

16:47.774 --> 16:50.343
Okay, sweetie,
love the lung capacity.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.544
We need
to calm down.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.713
I don't believe this.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.516
No lead role?
No speaking part?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.785
No lines at all?!

16:58.818 --> 17:00.387
Who got the lead, huh?
Who is it?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.589
I'll take him out!
Oh, I will take him out!

17:02.622 --> 17:04.357
We're going down to that school
and somebody's getting fired.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.558
Today!

17:05.592 --> 17:07.227
Slow down.
Take a breath.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.428
Or we go subtle.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.097
I'll call
this P.I. I know.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.564
He'll find something
on that drama teacher.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.300
Let the dirt
do the work.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.569
Hey, hey, we're gonna go
comfort Andy, who, no doubt,

17:16.603 --> 17:19.206
is a wreck right now, but I have
to point out what's happening --

17:19.239 --> 17:22.142
you're being
super parent-y.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.644
No, I am being
super professional

17:24.677 --> 17:26.479
because I care
about my work.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.847
Getting the teacher fired?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.516
Would you do that
for one of your clients?

17:29.549 --> 17:31.151
Would you do that
for Blake Griffin?

17:31.184 --> 17:32.519
If I saw
how hard he worked

17:32.552 --> 17:34.254
and he had something
taken away from him,

17:34.287 --> 17:37.390
and he was a really great kid,
yes, I would!

17:38.658 --> 17:39.459
Damn it!

17:39.492 --> 17:41.128

17:41.161 --> 17:42.562
[ Door closes ]

17:47.500 --> 17:49.502
[ Sighs ]
Oh, Andy.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.404
I know, but let's
keep perspective,

17:51.438 --> 17:53.206
this isn't the worst thing
that's ever happened to him.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.642
This is the worst thing
that has ever happened to me!

17:55.675 --> 17:57.844
Andy, they don't know --
Oh, buddy --
Shh!

17:57.877 --> 18:00.780
I've been such a tool
for the patriarchy,

18:00.813 --> 18:02.782
making you
change for me?

18:02.815 --> 18:05.752
A real man should love you
just the way you are.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.121
I'm a greaser no more.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.189
Oh, baby,

18:09.222 --> 18:10.757
I'm so happy you turned
your back on society for me.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.426
I'm going to work now,

18:13.460 --> 18:15.828
where my pay is equal
to my male colleagues.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.265
What the hell is going on?
Dora: Andy,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.267
this is hard
for me to say

18:20.300 --> 18:22.169
because you're my brother,
but...

18:22.202 --> 18:23.536
that was amazing.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.637
Really?

18:24.671 --> 18:28.241
You are my post-feminist hero,
John Newton Olivia!

18:28.275 --> 18:29.509
Can you believe that?

18:29.542 --> 18:31.278
I'm John Newton Olivia!

18:31.311 --> 18:33.246
Of course
I can believe it!

18:33.280 --> 18:34.747
I'm so happy for you.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.284
I know this wasn't
our original plan,

18:37.317 --> 18:38.618
but after I crushed
that audition

18:38.651 --> 18:39.752
and didn't even get
a small role,

18:39.786 --> 18:42.889
I said, "Mr. Doyle,
screw you."

18:42.922 --> 18:43.690
Yes.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.225
Five minutes later,
I apologized.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.559
I was raised right.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.827
The man's got a lot
on his plate.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.362
And now you got
your first lead.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.398
First of many.
Easy.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.300
Thank you, Alice. I-I couldn't
have done it without you.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.667
Come on, I want to
get you fitted.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.836
First dress
is in a week.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.905
Also, you'll be wearing a dress
for the final number.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.640
Cool.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.544
[ Laughing ]
Oh, my God.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.681
What...
a roller coaster.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.816
I feel like I've had
a heart attack,

19:09.849 --> 19:11.318
walked a tightrope,
and won the lottery,

19:11.351 --> 19:12.785
all at the same time.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.787
Uh-huh. There's a word
for those feelings --

19:14.821 --> 19:16.656
parent-y. [ Chuckles ]

19:16.689 --> 19:19.659
Ugh. All the children
have the power to do that?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.261
Yep, even Dora.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.395
Oh, boy.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.431
Now I get
why you tried to stop me.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.598
I'm glad I couldn't.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.272
For the record, I may be
feeling a little parent-y,

19:32.305 --> 19:33.506
but I did not cry.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.674
No, you didn't.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.343
I didn't.

list of things *

* That I like about you

19:45.685 --> 19:48.988
* And appearance
is not numbers one *

19:49.021 --> 19:51.258
* On through 22

19:51.291 --> 19:54.694

Are you getting this?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.267
Oh, I'm getting it.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.770
Look at Bunny
with the spotlight

20:03.803 --> 20:06.339
like a pro!
Ben: Right?

20:06.373 --> 20:07.574
Said it was an important job
and I meant it.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.309
[ Laughs ] Yeah.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.444
He's a star!

Sure, of a garage play,
but still!

Whoo-hoo!

So, what'd you think
of the show?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.735
I didn't like it as much
as the real "Grease."

20:35.768 --> 20:37.870
But you liked it?
I guess.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.406
What was
your favorite part?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.308
I liked
that Andy wore a dress.

20:41.341 --> 20:44.043
That was funny.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.913
Oh, and I also liked the girl
forgot her lines and cried.

I was going for, right, Bunny?

What do you want me
to tell you, Dora?
