00:35.591 --> 00:38.820
Damn FDA.
Why can't it all be marshmallow?

00:39.219 --> 00:42.550
Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow
pieces back in the box.

00:42.222 --> 00:43.717
They go in the trash.

00:43.891 --> 00:45.848
You like sweets, kids?

00:46.600 --> 00:48.681
I know a place that's sweeter
than sweetness itself.

00:48.854 --> 00:52.223
In this sweet place,
earthly doughnuts are sour as poison.

00:52.399 --> 00:53.893
You'd spit them out, you would.

00:55.569 --> 01:00.480
I'm talking about
the Candy Industry Trade Show.

01:00.699 --> 01:01.897
How did you get tickets?

01:02.117 --> 01:04.608
They hid them in every
millionth Krusty Klump Bar...

01:04.828 --> 01:06.536
...and Krusty Klump Bar
with almonds.

01:10.626 --> 01:12.453
Hey. Hey.

01:12.628 --> 01:15.545
I have asked you nicely
not to mangle my merchandise.

01:15.714 --> 01:18.632
You leave me no choice
but to ask you nicely again.

01:19.468 --> 01:22.671
- Can I come to the candy show? Can I?
- No, me. Take me, me, me.

01:22.846 --> 01:24.175
Sorry, kids.

01:24.348 --> 01:27.681
But this the one event
I want my darling wife by my side.

01:27.893 --> 01:30.598
0h, well, thank you, Homer.
But take one of the kids.

01:30.813 --> 01:33.351
Marge, they can't carry enough candy.

01:33.524 --> 01:37.230
They have puny little muscles.
Not big, ropy ones like you.

01:37.903 --> 01:42.565
- You go, Mom. For the greater good.
- For the greater good.

01:43.617 --> 01:46.730
Homer, are all
these pockets necessary?

01:46.286 --> 01:49.490
They wouldn't be if you would
sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.

01:49.707 --> 01:53.407
Well, that's the babysitter. No one
in town will sit for you two anymore.

01:53.585 --> 01:57.630
I had to choose between a grad student
at the university or a scary-looking hobo.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.212
Please, the hobo.
Please, the hobo. The hobo.

02:00.592 --> 02:02.466
Hi. I'm Ashley Grant.

02:03.804 --> 02:06.924
Ashley Grant. You gave a talk
on women's issues at my school...

02:07.990 --> 02:09.590
...on how we don't have to
be second-class citizens.

02:09.768 --> 02:12.259
Mom, how can you leave us
with this maniac?

02:12.438 --> 02:14.644
Hurry. If we're early,
we can get a picture...

02:14.815 --> 02:16.642
...with the two surviving Musketeers.

02:16.817 --> 02:19.901
There's also a baby
somewhere upstairs.

02:20.571 --> 02:25.399
So you're one of those
"don't-call-me-a-chick" chicks, huh?

02:26.160 --> 02:28.402
Sorry about
my unenlightened brother.

02:28.579 --> 02:30.785
He will make
the next few hours a living hell.

02:30.956 --> 02:32.331
Oh, I don't know.

02:32.499 --> 02:34.207
See this, Bart?

02:35.294 --> 02:36.836
Disemboweler IV.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.871
The game where condemned criminals
dig at each other with rusty hooks.

02:41.592 --> 02:44.297
Do a little housework
and you can play for five minutes.

02:44.511 --> 02:46.385
No way.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.141
- Yes.
- See, Lisa? Male's aren't hard to tame.

02:51.310 --> 02:55.224
They all follow their video cartridges.

03:03.405 --> 03:05.528
Mr. Goodbar to the front desk.

03:05.699 --> 03:08.369
The front desk
is looking for Mr. Goodbar.

03:09.411 --> 03:12.661
I feel like a kid
in some kind of a store.

03:15.876 --> 03:17.370
Brilliant.

03:18.462 --> 03:19.790
Exquisite.

03:19.964 --> 03:21.707
You'll do well. Give me those.

03:23.884 --> 03:26.422
Well, as you can see,
I have created a lemon ball so sour...

03:26.595 --> 03:29.762
...it can only be safely contained
in a magnetic field.

03:29.974 --> 03:33.389
The candy, known as 77X42...

03:33.769 --> 03:36.604
- Where the hell is the candy?
- I don't know.

03:38.148 --> 03:39.892
Hey, sir. Try our wax lips.

03:40.109 --> 03:42.896
- It's the candy of 1000 uses.
- Like what?

03:43.112 --> 03:45.947
One, a humorous substitute
for your own lips.

03:46.365 --> 03:49.319
- Keep going.
- Two...

03:49.785 --> 03:51.659
I'm needed in the basement.

04:05.718 --> 04:09.336
You're gonna have to put some sugar
on that celery or get out, ma'am.

04:14.143 --> 04:15.970
Gummi bears. Gummi calves' heads.

04:16.144 --> 04:18.814
Gummi jawbreakers.

04:24.570 --> 04:28.484
- What's that?
- That is the rarest gummi of them all.

04:28.699 --> 04:31.984
The gummi Venus de Milo,
carved by gummi artisans...

04:32.161 --> 04:34.865
...who work exclusively
in the medium of gummi.

04:35.390 --> 04:37.245
Will you two stop saying
"gummi" so much?

04:40.210 --> 04:42.452
Must have rare gummi.
Distract the salesman.

04:42.630 --> 04:46.129
No. I won't make a spectacle
out of myself any further.

04:50.262 --> 04:52.718
How did they get there?

04:56.393 --> 05:00.940
Now, this is going to take all my skill.

05:02.399 --> 05:05.566
- Halt! Halt!
- Run, Marge. Save the booty.

05:05.778 --> 05:07.438
After him. He has the gummi.

05:21.543 --> 05:24.810
See you in hell, candy boy!

05:37.476 --> 05:39.801
Lis, I found a big caramel deposit
on her back.

05:39.979 --> 05:42.550
I'm coming.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.317
Wait a minute. Wait.
Where's my gummi de Milo?

05:50.531 --> 05:54.231
Okay, don't panic. She can't
have gotten far. She has no arms.

05:54.451 --> 05:55.780
I'm sure it'll turn up.

05:55.953 --> 05:59.156
Take the babysitter home now.
She's been in the car for 20 minutes.

05:59.331 --> 06:02.747
Relax, Marge.
There's plenty for her to do in there.

06:03.293 --> 06:05.831
See? She's having the time of her life.

06:07.881 --> 06:09.340
So a graduate student, huh?

06:09.508 --> 06:12.758
How come you can go to the moon,
but can't make my shoes smell good?

06:12.928 --> 06:14.837
- I'm sorry?
- Nobody's blaming you.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.805
Could you take the wheel
for a second?

06:17.160 --> 06:20.764
- I have to scratch in two places at once.
- Just drop me off here.

06:26.660 --> 06:27.774
Precious Venus.

06:32.948 --> 06:34.941
Thank you.

06:44.501 --> 06:46.827
Hey, kids.
Lots of candy left for breakfast.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.924
Why don't we give it
to some needy children then?

06:58.974 --> 07:01.133
The candy conventioneers
tracked us down.

07:03.145 --> 07:06.160
There he is. There's the man
that sexually harassed me.

07:07.316 --> 07:10.815
For a minute there I thought
I was in big trouble. It's just a...

07:12.738 --> 07:16.866
Two, four, six, eight
Homer's crime was very great

07:17.201 --> 07:21.198
"Great" meaning "large or immense"
We use it in the pejorative sense

07:21.372 --> 07:24.954
Marge, I swear I didn't touch her.
You know how bashful I am.

07:25.125 --> 07:29.123
I can't even say the word "titmouse"
without giggling like a schoolgirl.

07:31.173 --> 07:32.501
At any rate, I believe you.

07:32.675 --> 07:35.212
I think you should go outside
and straighten this out.

07:35.386 --> 07:38.550
Some of their chants
are very catchy and memorable.

07:39.932 --> 07:43.135
- You grabbed me in the car.
- Oh, that? No.

07:43.310 --> 07:46.644
I was grabbing a gummi Venus de Milo
that got stuck to your pants.

07:46.855 --> 07:50.639
Yeah, right.
That's the oldest excuse in the book.

07:51.527 --> 07:53.270
Come on. I'm a decent guy.

07:59.702 --> 08:02.453
Why would anybody
wanna touch a girl's butt?

08:02.621 --> 08:04.281
That's where cooties come from.

08:04.456 --> 08:06.698
I don't understand.
What is she saying you did?

08:06.917 --> 08:09.871
Lisa, remember that postcard
Grampa sent us from Florida...

08:10.450 --> 08:12.334
...of that alligator
biting that woman's bottom?

08:12.506 --> 08:15.175
Oh, yeah. That was brilliant.

08:15.342 --> 08:17.667
That's right.
We all thought it was hilarious.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.588
But it turns out we were wrong.

08:19.763 --> 08:22.681
That alligator was
sexually harassing that woman.

08:22.891 --> 08:24.967
And the dog in the Coppertone ad?
Same deal?

08:25.185 --> 08:26.845
Well, that's kind of a gray area.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.732
- We know you're innocent, Dad.
- Thanks, kids.

08:29.940 --> 08:33.274
They seem to be building some
sort of a shantytown.

08:40.326 --> 08:43.529
Do your worst, protestors.
You can't stop me from living my life.

08:44.330 --> 08:48.300
- No respect for women. No peace.
- Try to push the right buttons now.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.699
We ain't crazy about
nuclear power either!

08:50.878 --> 08:52.705
You people aren't allowed in here.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.584
It's okay. They're with me.

09:03.641 --> 09:04.885
They're ruining my whole life.

09:05.590 --> 09:07.384
Marge, please,
this is where I need you the most.

09:07.561 --> 09:11.144
I'm counting on you to do something
or say something to make it all better.

09:11.315 --> 09:14.185
- Okay. Go.
- Homer...

09:14.985 --> 09:18.152
I talked to the indignation coordinator
out on the lawn today.

09:18.322 --> 09:20.694
I said you were a decent man.
She wouldn't listen.

09:20.866 --> 09:24.200
Besides standing by you and
supporting you, there's nothing I can do.

09:24.370 --> 09:26.196
You mean, I'm on my own?

09:26.413 --> 09:28.323
I've never been on my own. Oh, no.

09:28.499 --> 09:32.959
On own. On own.
I need help. Oh, God, help me.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.661
Help me, God!

09:39.802 --> 09:44.262
- Hello?
- Hello, Homer, this is God...

09:44.431 --> 09:47.302
...frey Jones from
the TV magazine show Rock Bottom.

09:47.935 --> 09:51.767
We're aware of your problems,
and, Mr. Simpson, we want to help.

09:52.523 --> 09:57.149
I saw that report you did on Sasquatch.
It was fair and even-handed.

09:57.319 --> 09:58.648
I'll do it.

09:58.862 --> 10:01.210
Somebody had to take
the babysitter home.

10:01.198 --> 10:05.243
Then I noticed she was sitting on the
gummi Venus, so I grabbed it off her.

10:05.411 --> 10:10.405
Oh, just thinking about
that sweet, sweet candy...

10:11.834 --> 10:15.618
I just wish I had
another one right now.

10:15.796 --> 10:18.832
- But the most important thing is...
- That was great, Mr. Simpson.

10:19.490 --> 10:20.627
- We got everything we need.
- Okay.

10:20.801 --> 10:23.430
Say, can you introduce me
to the Sasquatch?

10:23.220 --> 10:24.762
I like his style.

10:29.476 --> 10:32.146
Here comes the bouncing ball
of justice.

10:32.313 --> 10:33.890
Tonight on Rock Bottom:

10:34.106 --> 10:37.605
We go undercover at a sex farm
for sex hookers.

10:37.818 --> 10:41.187
I keep telling you,
I just grow sorghum here.

10:41.488 --> 10:44.406
- And where are the hookers?
- Around back.

10:45.451 --> 10:49.690
But first, she was a university honors
student who devoted her life to kids.

10:49.246 --> 10:52.995
Until the night a grossly overweight
pervert named Homer Simpson...

10:53.167 --> 10:55.872
...gave her a crash course
in depravity.

10:56.450 --> 10:57.918
"Babysitter and the Beast."

10:58.130 --> 10:59.708
Oh, crap.

10:59.923 --> 11:02.820
Somebody had to take
the babysitter home.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.797
Then I noticed she was sitting
on her sweet can...

11:05.120 --> 11:06.755
I grabbed her sweet can...

11:06.930 --> 11:09.172
Oh, just thinking about her can...

11:09.350 --> 11:12.553
I just wish I had
her sweet, sweet, sweet can.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.806
So, Mr. Simpson,
you admit you grabbed her can.

11:15.981 --> 11:17.855
What do you have to say
in your defense?

11:19.443 --> 11:22.479
Mr. Simpson, your silence
will only incriminate you further.

11:23.197 --> 11:26.696
No, Mr. Simpson, don’t take your anger
out on me. Get back. Get back!

11:26.867 --> 11:30.117
- Mr. Simpson, no!
- Dramatization: May not have happened.

11:32.810 --> 11:36.292
Marge, kids,
everything's gonna be just fine.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.666
Now go upstairs and pack your bags.

11:38.837 --> 11:43.100
We're gonna start a new life
under the sea.

11:55.145 --> 11:57.434
Under the sea

11:57.606 --> 12:00.275
Under the sea

12:00.484 --> 12:02.642
There'll be no accusations

12:02.820 --> 12:09.439
Just friendly crustaceans
Under the sea

12:19.860 --> 12:23.000
That's your solution to everything,
to move under the sea. It won't happen.

12:23.465 --> 12:25.257
Not with that attitude.

12:25.467 --> 12:28.410
Look, maybe this whole thing
will blow over.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.723
It didn't blow over, Marge.
Nothing ever blows over for me.

12:52.161 --> 12:53.489
Simpson scandal update.

12:53.662 --> 12:57.576
Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent
he believes gives him sexual powers.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.750
Hey, that's a half-truth.

13:01.503 --> 13:03.211
I don’t know Homer Simpson.

13:03.380 --> 13:07.544
I never met Homer Simpson
or had any contact with him, but...

13:09.887 --> 13:12.176
I'm sorry, I can’t go on.

13:12.389 --> 13:16.304
That's okay. Your tears say more
than real evidence ever could.

13:16.894 --> 13:18.388
Today on Ben:

13:18.562 --> 13:23.224
Mothers and runaway daughters reunited
by their hatred of Homer Simpson.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.350
And here's your host, Gentle Ben.

13:33.118 --> 13:34.577
I just have one thing to say.

13:34.787 --> 13:38.950
Let's have less Homer Simpsons
and more money for public schools.

13:40.501 --> 13:42.789
Ben, I have a question.

13:44.505 --> 13:46.581
No, Ben. No.

13:57.309 --> 13:59.634
And now we return to
Fox Night at the Movies.

13:59.812 --> 14:03.394
Homer S: Portrait of an Ass-Grabber.
Starring Dennis Franz.

14:04.149 --> 14:07.768
Portrait. Sounds classy.

14:07.987 --> 14:09.529
Doesn't it?

14:20.582 --> 14:23.730
No, Mr. Simpson.
A cat is a living creature.

14:23.252 --> 14:24.829
I don’t care.

14:28.882 --> 14:32.133
Now I'm gonna grab me
something sweet.

14:32.344 --> 14:34.551
No, Mr. Simpson.
That's sexual harassment.

14:34.722 --> 14:37.888
If you keep it up, I'll yell so loud,
the whole country will hear.

14:38.976 --> 14:41.811
With a man in the White House?

14:41.979 --> 14:44.550
Not likely.

14:48.152 --> 14:51.271
This is hour 57 of our live,
round-the-clock coverage...

14:51.447 --> 14:52.905
...outside the Simpson estate.

14:53.730 --> 14:56.407
Remember to tune in tonight at 8:00
for highlights of today's vigil...

14:56.577 --> 14:58.486
...including when
the garbage man came...

14:58.662 --> 15:00.821
...and when Marge Simpson
put the cat out.

15:00.998 --> 15:03.667
Possibly because it was harassed.
We don’t know.

15:03.876 --> 15:06.340
There's no way to see
into the Simpson home...

15:06.211 --> 15:09.248
...without some kind of infrared,
heat-sensitive camera.

15:09.423 --> 15:11.416
So let's turn it on.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.673
Now, this technology is new to me...

15:13.844 --> 15:16.596
...but I'm pretty sure
that's Homer Simpson in the oven...

15:16.764 --> 15:21.342
...rotating slowly. His body temperature
has risen to over 400 degrees.

15:21.518 --> 15:23.725
He's literally stewing
in his own juices.

15:23.938 --> 15:26.263
Now here are some results
from our phone-in poll.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.690
Ninety-five percent of the people
believe Homer Simpson is guilty.

15:29.860 --> 15:31.936
Of course,
this is just a television poll...

15:32.112 --> 15:35.528
...which is not legally binding,
unless Proposition 304 passes.

15:35.699 --> 15:37.750
And we all pray it will.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.780
I don't have a friend in the world.

15:41.246 --> 15:43.535
- Let us through.
- We're Homer's true friends.

15:43.707 --> 15:45.534
Oh, really?

15:45.751 --> 15:50.579
- Come on, let us through, you vultures.
- Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.

15:50.798 --> 15:52.292
How can you judge this man...

15:52.466 --> 15:55.171
...without talking to the people
who know him best?

15:55.344 --> 15:58.927
We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson,
and the bidding starts at 10 G's.

15:59.980 --> 16:00.841
- I bid 10 G's.
- Ten-five G's.

16:04.436 --> 16:05.978
I need a hug.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.859
How come you guys hesitated?

16:13.700 --> 16:15.561
Sorry, Dad.
We do believe in you. We really do.

16:15.739 --> 16:17.399
It's just hard not to listen to TV.

16:17.574 --> 16:19.947
It's spent so much more time
raising us than you.

16:20.911 --> 16:22.738
Maybe TV is right.

16:22.913 --> 16:24.953
TV's always right.

16:33.465 --> 16:34.876
Are you hugging the TV?

16:35.500 --> 16:36.544
- No.
- No.

16:43.267 --> 16:47.976
And the number one reference
that I am running into the ground is:

16:48.188 --> 16:50.311
Homer Simpson.

16:57.406 --> 16:59.149
Is Homer Simpson.

17:04.371 --> 17:07.906
I like it better when they're
making fun of people who aren't me.

17:08.829 --> 17:09.875
I know. Evening at the Improv.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.368
They never talk about anything
beyond the 1980s.

17:12.963 --> 17:14.291
I think about weird stuff.

17:14.464 --> 17:17.501
Like, what would happen if E. T.
And Mr. T had a baby?

17:17.675 --> 17:19.752
Well, you'd get Mr. E. T.,
wouldn't you?

17:19.928 --> 17:23.380
And, you know, I think he'd sound
a little something like this:

17:23.557 --> 17:27.388
"I pity the fool
who doesn't phone home."

17:29.210 --> 17:31.600
I wouldn't wanna be
Mr. T right now.

17:31.231 --> 17:34.980
Homer. Homer, the kids have a
great idea how you can clear your name.

17:35.194 --> 17:38.290
The media's making you a monster
because they don't care about truth.

17:38.197 --> 17:39.988
All they care about is entertainment.

17:40.157 --> 17:43.443
You need a forum where they don't
know the meaning of entertainment:

17:43.619 --> 17:45.695
Public access television.

17:46.121 --> 17:49.573
- But those shows all look so crummy.
- Well, we could dress it up a bit.

17:49.792 --> 17:52.911
We can bring a fern,
and a folding chair from the garage...

17:53.870 --> 17:56.410
...and the most decorative thing of all,
the truth.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.849
There are only 49 stars on that flag.

18:07.590 --> 18:11.104
I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground
before I recognize Missouri.

18:13.941 --> 18:16.514
Now it's time for
The Innocence Report...

18:16.693 --> 18:18.401
...with Homer Simpson.

18:20.114 --> 18:22.106
Hello. I am Homer Simpson.

18:22.282 --> 18:25.983
Or, as some of you wags
have dubbed me, "Father Goose."

18:26.787 --> 18:30.238
You know, everybody believed
the worst about me right away.

18:30.416 --> 18:32.492
Nobody cares that I didn't do it.

18:32.668 --> 18:33.996
But I didn't.

18:34.169 --> 18:37.400
Okay, look, I've done
some bad things in my life.

18:37.172 --> 18:40.126
But harassing women
is not one of them.

18:40.342 --> 18:44.292
Like one time, we were having this race
with this stupid, old-timey bicycle...

18:44.471 --> 18:45.965
...with the big wheel in front.

18:46.140 --> 18:48.216
So I figure, "We'll see about that."

18:48.392 --> 18:51.891
So I get this big chunk
of cinderblock, and I...

18:53.188 --> 18:54.517
Oh, gotta go.

18:54.690 --> 18:56.650
Innocent.

18:56.275 --> 18:58.682
Dad, you did it. I am so proud of you.

18:58.861 --> 19:01.434
The switchboards are lighting up.

19:02.239 --> 19:04.445
Two calls. That's our best ever.

19:04.616 --> 19:06.905
Hello? No, Janice doesn't live here.

19:07.770 --> 19:10.577
Hello? Yes, I am interested
in long-distance savings.

19:10.748 --> 19:12.824
Very interested.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.875
Marge, this is so depressing.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.748
My only hope
is this homemade Prozac.

19:23.344 --> 19:25.835
Needs more ice cream.

19:28.599 --> 19:31.719
So you don't like
the old-time bikes, huh?

19:37.524 --> 19:40.194
Homer, I love amateur video.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.730
And your show
is the most amateur video I ever saw.

19:43.906 --> 19:47.903
My hobby is secretly
videotaping couples in cars.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.780
I didn't come forward
because in this country...

19:51.246 --> 19:53.203
...it makes you look like a pervert.

19:53.415 --> 19:56.950
But every single
Scottish person does it!

19:58.420 --> 20:01.624
Oh, baby. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.632
Oh, no. That's Mayor Quimby.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.802
Here we go.

20:07.137 --> 20:09.628
Precious Venus.

20:12.267 --> 20:14.426
Thank you.

20:17.523 --> 20:19.147
Dad, this clears you completely.

20:19.316 --> 20:21.475
You know, the courts might not
work anymore...

20:21.652 --> 20:24.569
...but as long as everybody
is videotaping everyone else...

20:24.738 --> 20:26.778
...justice will be done.

20:29.159 --> 20:30.274
See?

20:31.120 --> 20:32.911
Homer, I thought you were an animal.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.203
But your daughter said
you were a decent man.

20:35.374 --> 20:38.790
- I guess she was right.
- You're both right.

20:40.546 --> 20:42.289
In our mad pursuit of a scoop...

20:42.506 --> 20:46.171
...we members of the press
sometimes make mistakes.

20:46.343 --> 20:49.480
Rock Bottom would like to make
the following corrections:

20:51.557 --> 20:54.308
Wow, V8 juice
isn't one-eighth gasoline.

20:54.476 --> 20:58.688
- And Ted Koppel is a robot.
- There's you, Dad.

21:00.274 --> 21:02.183
Tomorrow on Rock Bottom.

21:02.401 --> 21:06.778
He's a foreigner who takes perverted
videos of you when you least suspect it.

21:06.947 --> 21:09.236
He's "Rowdy Roddy Peeper".

21:11.118 --> 21:12.826
Oh, that man is sick.

21:12.995 --> 21:14.904
Groundskeeper Willie
saved you, Homer.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.369
But listen to the music. He's evil.

21:17.541 --> 21:20.992
Hasn't this experience taught you
you can't believe everything you hear?

21:21.170 --> 21:25.583
Marge, my friend,
I haven't learned a thing.

21:32.848 --> 21:35.635
Let's never fight again.

22:30.656 --> 22:32.732
