In New York City's war on crime,

00:04.979 --> 00:08.118
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.118 --> 00:10.223
of the Major Case Squad.

00:10.223 --> 00:12.979
These are their stories.

00:49.282 --> 00:51.716
Let's go.

01:18.992 --> 01:20.946
See, I'm an architecture student at Madison,

01:20.946 --> 01:23.566
and I'm doing my thesison Mr. Laurette.

01:23.566 --> 01:24.929
He designed this house back in '76.

01:24.929 --> 01:26.185
I think you have the wrong address.

01:26.185 --> 01:27.632
No, no, this is definitely a Laurette.

01:27.632 --> 01:28.663
If I could just take a quick look...

01:28.663 --> 01:31.200
I don't think so.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.095
Uh, okay.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.426
I didn't mean to creep you out.

01:36.426 --> 01:37.264
This is my number.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.773
You can call me if you change your mind.

01:46.874 --> 01:51.428
This is a great design, Noah.

01:51.428 --> 01:54.578
Your vision's maturing,

01:54.578 --> 01:56.051
but I don't think I can help you.

01:56.051 --> 01:59.994
I just need enough to cover the cost.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.538
I don't have that kind of money.

02:01.538 --> 02:05.897
Yes, you do. I know you do.

02:05.897 --> 02:09.453
You're wrong, Noah.

02:09.453 --> 02:14.239
And I don't feel comfortable
with this other complication.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.402
Noah Preston.

02:30.402 --> 02:33.495
Oh, that's great.
Uh, when can l...

02:33.495 --> 02:35.374
Sure. Uh, sure,
I guess that'd be okay.

02:35.374 --> 02:38.520
Uh, when can I come by?

02:38.520 --> 02:41.843
Okay. Yeah, I'll be there.

02:57.379 --> 03:01.453
Oh, geez.

03:02.659 --> 03:06.631
Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/10/05

03:54.192 --> 03:56.996
He had his arm out like
he was pointing to somebody,

03:56.996 --> 03:59.485
and he was trying to say something.

03:59.485 --> 04:01.714
You notice who came in just before him?

04:01.714 --> 04:03.652
Just people, you know,

04:03.652 --> 04:05.658
hurrying to catch trains.

04:05.658 --> 04:06.937
Okay, thanks.

04:06.937 --> 04:10.567
The detective will take
your formal statement.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.816
We have Noah Preston, 25.

04:12.816 --> 04:16.548
New York State driver's license,
library card...

04:16.548 --> 04:20.074
a man after your own heart.

04:20.074 --> 04:23.844
Eighty bucks, no credit cards.

04:23.844 --> 04:25.401
He traveled light.

04:25.401 --> 04:27.364
Very light. It's raining,

04:27.364 --> 04:30.058
he's not wearing a jacket.

04:30.058 --> 04:31.347
He's hardly wet.

04:31.347 --> 04:32.965
He wasn't outside long.

04:32.965 --> 04:34.803
Maybe a cab just dropped him off.

04:34.803 --> 04:36.279
A cab or his own car.

04:36.279 --> 04:39.400
I didn't find any house keys on him.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.444
They could be with his car keys.

04:41.444 --> 04:42.920
Round puncture wound.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.877
Edges look ragged. No powder burns.

04:45.877 --> 04:47.523
Ink smudges.

04:47.523 --> 04:50.911
Faint. Looks like some
kind of numbers or writing.

04:50.911 --> 04:56.029
Patrol found Preston's car
half an hour ago over on 37 th.

04:57.417 --> 04:58.341
It was blocking a hydrant,

04:58.341 --> 04:59.897
so we called for a tow.

04:59.897 --> 05:02.019
Then we saw they took all the air bags.

05:02.019 --> 05:05.426
That's where the market is these days.

05:09.953 --> 05:12.571
There's blood drops on the seat.

05:12.571 --> 05:16.279
Looks like Preston was stabbed here.

05:16.279 --> 05:18.260
The killer might have been in the passenger seat.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.437
Maybe Preston picked up

05:19.437 --> 05:22.522
some short-term companionship
and got played.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.606
They stabbed him and stole his car.

05:24.606 --> 05:26.392
Or there were two crimes

05:26.392 --> 05:28.969
and two unrelated perps.

05:28.969 --> 05:31.792
One stabs Preston.

05:31.792 --> 05:34.416
He follows his assailant into the station.

05:34.416 --> 05:35.892
Someone else

05:35.892 --> 05:41.099
sees the car idling on the curb and steals it.

05:42.571 --> 05:45.471
Well, I told him.

05:45.471 --> 05:46.231
Yeah? What did he say?

05:46.231 --> 05:47.382
He gave me a big hug.

05:47.382 --> 05:49.810
He said it was a great thing
I was doing for my sister.

05:49.810 --> 05:52.239
And he said when the time comes,

05:52.239 --> 05:55.363
he'll hook you up with a temporary partner.

05:55.363 --> 05:57.877
Oh, no. I didn't even think of that.

05:57.877 --> 05:58.864
Well, what did you say?

05:58.864 --> 06:00.622
I pity the fool.

06:00.622 --> 06:01.813
How about our gal, huh?

06:01.813 --> 06:04.139
Surrogate mom?

06:06.689 --> 06:08.740
What are those, nightclub stamps?

06:08.740 --> 06:10.073
No. Preston had a habit of

06:10.073 --> 06:13.301
jotting notes on his hand.

06:13.301 --> 06:15.047
Some of these, they look like

06:15.047 --> 06:17.342
they could be calculations.

06:17.342 --> 06:18.711
Any luck finding the murder weapon?

06:18.711 --> 06:23.034
No, but we've got a pretty good idea of what it is.

06:24.975 --> 06:26.896
A Phillips-head screwdriver.

06:26.896 --> 06:28.206
The handyman killer.

06:28.206 --> 06:29.630
"Quoin."

06:29.630 --> 06:33.788
It's an architectural term
for a cornerstone.

06:35.649 --> 06:39.563
Then the numbers are probably measurements.

06:40.425 --> 06:44.851
Could be an engineer or architect.

06:44.851 --> 06:48.847
Those guys love joining professional associations.

06:48.847 --> 06:50.824
Adler Architecture
23 Courtlandt Street
Monday, March 31

06:50.824 --> 06:52.703
Either of you know what he was doing last night?

06:52.703 --> 06:55.684
I think he just went home on the West Side.

06:55.684 --> 06:56.658
I think he lived with a girlfriend.

06:56.658 --> 06:57.926
A girlfriend?

06:57.926 --> 07:00.184
I thought he was oriented the other way.

07:00.184 --> 07:02.127
I thought he lived in
New Jersey with his wife.

07:02.127 --> 07:03.734
Is that his personnel file?

07:03.734 --> 07:06.238
Yes.

07:06.238 --> 07:08.706
Same mailbox address.

07:08.706 --> 07:12.385
No dependents listed on his tax form.

07:12.385 --> 07:13.953
No home or cell phone?

07:13.953 --> 07:15.222
How did you keep in touch with him?

07:15.222 --> 07:17.367
Oh, he carried one of the site phones.

07:17.367 --> 07:20.429
Noah's just a very private person.

07:20.429 --> 07:23.186
When we looked him
up on the Architects Forum,

07:23.186 --> 07:26.141
we noticed he didn't have his license.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.575
Was there a problem with his work?

07:27.575 --> 07:29.632
No. He was extremely talented.

07:29.632 --> 07:31.757
He just never sat for the exam.

07:31.757 --> 07:35.082
I don't know why.
I encouraged him to.

07:35.082 --> 07:36.150
Well, without his license,

07:36.150 --> 07:40.003
he couldn't strike out on his own.

07:40.003 --> 07:42.137
Did he have a lack of self-confidence?

07:42.137 --> 07:42.978
Uh, I don't think so.

07:42.978 --> 07:44.844
He was always working on his own designs.

07:44.844 --> 07:46.482
Any of them here?

07:46.482 --> 07:48.931
Um...

07:50.281 --> 07:54.711
No. This is just the usual stuff

07:54.711 --> 07:56.305
we do for the firm.

07:56.305 --> 07:59.041
Noah's designs were bold and grand.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.364
What about this?

08:00.364 --> 08:04.481
This isn't the usual stuff.

08:04.396 --> 08:07.336
It's, uh... It's an apartment.

08:07.336 --> 08:10.373
This molding on the door,

08:10.373 --> 08:12.475
l... I think I've seen that before.

08:12.475 --> 08:13.825
It's an Emery Roth building.

08:13.825 --> 08:16.534
Roth, Carrere and Hastings.1925.

08:16.534 --> 08:19.475
The Ritz Tower.

08:21.009 --> 08:22.643
Neat and tidy.

08:22.643 --> 08:26.111
Everything in its place
and a place for everything.

08:26.111 --> 08:28.153
The mind of an architect.

08:28.153 --> 08:29.615
Every tool in that closet

08:29.615 --> 08:31.906
except a large Phillips-head.

08:31.906 --> 08:35.438
Our handyman killer was here.

08:35.438 --> 08:36.850
Well, that not be all he took.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.241
It's the whole downtown.

08:41.881 --> 08:46.365
Then we have holes in the picture sequence.

08:46.365 --> 08:48.610
The killer might be in

08:48.610 --> 08:52.477
one of these missing photos.

08:56.888 --> 08:58.787
He was a cute kid.

08:58.787 --> 09:02.274
Nice-looking mom.

09:04.508 --> 09:06.142
No pictures of dad.

09:06.142 --> 09:07.732
Maybe this is why.

09:07.732 --> 09:12.056
It's a letter from Noah's professor at Madison.

09:12.056 --> 09:13.582
"Dear Noah,Your father asked me again to

09:13.582 --> 09:17.058
impress upon you the importance of
taking your licensing exam.

09:17.058 --> 09:19.876
He's despairing you'll ever achieve anything."

09:19.876 --> 09:21.020
Stage dad.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.404
No wonder he took himself off the radar.

09:23.404 --> 09:26.081
There's also a notation in Noah's handwriting...

09:26.081 --> 09:28.287
"Call."

09:28.287 --> 09:31.410
There's a dollar sign next to it.

09:31.410 --> 09:33.880
He hit up his dad?

09:34.741 --> 09:38.009
Or our friendly professor.

09:38.009 --> 09:39.835
This has become the most contentious

09:39.835 --> 09:41.970
piece of real estate in the world.

09:41.970 --> 09:44.498
I know the waters you have to navigate.

09:44.498 --> 09:46.785
You don't need a captain.

09:46.785 --> 09:48.257
You need an admiral.

09:48.257 --> 09:49.414
I can't predict

09:49.414 --> 09:51.521
what our final decision will be.

09:51.521 --> 09:54.787
I know the sentimental favorite
is out of the running.

09:54.787 --> 09:55.536
I can't comment.

09:55.536 --> 09:57.010
Abby, the city, the country,

09:57.010 --> 09:58.873
wants a monument for the ages.

09:58.873 --> 10:02.603
I build for the ages!

10:04.118 --> 10:06.447
Jim had high expectations for Noah.

10:06.447 --> 10:08.076
Even after he moved to Miami last year,

10:08.076 --> 10:09.773
he wouldn't stop writing the boy.

10:09.773 --> 10:11.797
How'd you end up the go-between?

10:11.797 --> 10:13.781
By default. I knew Noah's mother.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.824
She was active in historical preservation.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.597
Noah was very close to her.

10:18.597 --> 10:20.764
Did he ask his dad for money recently?

10:20.764 --> 10:23.168
- No.
- So it's you he asked?

10:23.168 --> 10:25.334
No. What gave you that idea?

10:25.334 --> 10:29.230
Noah did.He made a note about it.

10:29.230 --> 10:32.300
Well, he never got around to asking.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.243
Now, if you'll excuse me...

10:33.243 --> 10:34.986
It's kind of surprising

10:34.986 --> 10:37.697
that Noah would think that an associate

10:37.697 --> 10:39.444
professor would have that kind of

10:39.444 --> 10:42.284
spare cash lying around.

10:42.284 --> 10:43.629
What's that supposed to mean?

10:43.629 --> 10:46.131
Well, y-you don't have tenure,

10:46.131 --> 10:49.925
and you're supporting a wife and...

10:49.925 --> 10:53.249
well, I think littleJunior
spit up on you this morning.

10:53.249 --> 10:55.578
What is this, creamed corn?

10:55.578 --> 10:56.935
I bet he has a sideline.

10:56.935 --> 10:58.746
I bet he recruits for

10:58.746 --> 11:01.073
prestigious architectural firms.

11:01.073 --> 11:02.134
That's overstating.

11:02.134 --> 11:04.971
Well, you are the man on campus, aren't you?

11:04.971 --> 11:06.728
Now, isn't that a...

11:06.728 --> 11:10.048
a violation of your professorial ethics,

11:10.048 --> 11:12.657
Professor?

11:12.657 --> 11:14.761
Noah had submitted a design

11:14.761 --> 11:16.391
with the downtown reconstruction committee.

11:16.391 --> 11:17.964
A design for a new tower?

11:17.964 --> 11:19.460
Yeah.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.423
He wanted my help

11:20.423 --> 11:23.430
if the design got to
the next stage of the competition.

11:23.430 --> 11:25.328
How much help?

11:25.328 --> 11:30.168
For models, studies...about $50,000.

11:30.168 --> 11:32.372
And, what, you didn't like his design or...

11:32.372 --> 11:35.579
No. It was brilliant.

11:35.579 --> 11:38.006
My problem was with Noah.

11:38.006 --> 11:40.233
He said he had a silent partner...

11:40.233 --> 11:42.438
a licensed architect that he wouldn't name.

11:42.438 --> 11:46.190
And you're wondering
if this silent partner really existed,

11:46.190 --> 11:48.155
why didn't Noah ask him for the money?

11:48.155 --> 11:49.794
Exactly.

11:51.047 --> 11:53.708
Now can I go?

11:56.302 --> 11:59.884
Maybe Noah didn't ask because
he was freezing out his partner.

11:59.884 --> 12:02.518
Yeah, his silent partner...

12:02.518 --> 12:06.107
he didn't go quietly.

12:08.315 --> 12:11.279
The more we looked at the other designs,

12:11.279 --> 12:13.202
the more we came back to Noah's.

12:13.202 --> 12:14.279
But a kid just out of school,

12:14.279 --> 12:16.893
what kind of chance could he really have?

12:16.893 --> 12:19.647
That's the appeal, isn't it?

12:19.647 --> 12:22.951
That an unknown architect...

12:22.951 --> 12:26.961
with a breathtaking and heartbreaking

12:26.961 --> 12:30.660
design...commemorate a...

12:30.660 --> 12:36.121
a breathtaking, heartbreaking national tragedy.

12:36.121 --> 12:37.615
Like the...

12:37.615 --> 12:40.839
the young architect
and the Vietnam Memorial.

12:40.839 --> 12:43.495
It's the best of what we're about.

12:43.495 --> 12:46.108
A design chosen on merit,

12:46.108 --> 12:47.428
not pedigree.

12:47.428 --> 12:49.364
We heard Noah had a silent partner.

12:49.364 --> 12:50.224
Yes.

12:50.224 --> 12:52.962
And since we don't know how to contact this person,

12:52.962 --> 12:55.796
we have to eliminate Noah's design.

12:55.796 --> 12:57.106
Can an architect submit

12:57.106 --> 12:59.194
more than one design under his own name?

12:59.194 --> 13:01.234
No.

13:01.234 --> 13:02.501
And you'd have no way of knowing

13:02.501 --> 13:04.721
if this silent partner...

13:04.721 --> 13:07.255
submitted a design under his own name?

13:07.255 --> 13:11.636
No. We wouldn't.

13:13.944 --> 13:15.746
The silent partner might've thought he was doing

13:15.746 --> 13:18.417
Noah a harmless favor until he found out

13:18.417 --> 13:23.225
Noah's design was about to ace out his own.

13:25.592 --> 13:27.426
Twenty designs in the semifinals,

13:27.426 --> 13:30.425
most with teams of architects...

13:30.425 --> 13:33.874
about 40 suspects in all.

13:34.430 --> 13:37.403
So, the killer might have stolen Noah's photos...

13:37.403 --> 13:39.937
because he was in them.

13:39.937 --> 13:42.632
If we could find out when the photos were taken,

13:42.632 --> 13:45.631
we could check for alibis.

13:45.631 --> 13:47.267
The light is...

13:47.267 --> 13:48.798
is coming from the east.

13:48.798 --> 13:51.218
You can see the shadows are short,

13:51.218 --> 13:52.654
so it's probably around noon.

13:52.654 --> 13:55.103
The newspaper boxes are all turned around.

13:55.103 --> 13:56.628
There's a bank on the right.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.098
What is that?

14:02.186 --> 14:04.996
Some guy dressed up like a big nickel?

14:04.996 --> 14:06.469
A bank promotion.

14:06.469 --> 14:07.451
Well, it can't be every day

14:07.451 --> 14:11.021
they have a giant nickel outside their bank.

14:11.021 --> 14:13.381
Office of
Ben Laurette, A.I.A.
468 Reade Street
Wendesday, April 2

14:13.381 --> 14:15.612
I've been down there a lot surveying the sites,

14:15.612 --> 14:19.341
but I don't remember any accident.

14:19.341 --> 14:21.568
Hit-and-runs happen very fast.

14:21.568 --> 14:23.713
Your secretary said you were taking photos that day.

14:23.713 --> 14:27.018
Maybe you caught something without realizing it.

14:27.018 --> 14:30.260
Anna, bring me the photo
set for the second of this month.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.550
This is your design for downtown?

14:32.550 --> 14:34.246
Yes.

14:34.246 --> 14:37.448
Something about it that's familiar.

14:37.448 --> 14:39.843
It's familiar because
it references my other buildings.

14:39.843 --> 14:41.061
Whether you like it or not,

14:41.061 --> 14:44.448
my work has entered your subconscious.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.453
Mm. And I thought it was
last night's pot stickers.

14:46.453 --> 14:50.978
Lucky for me that I like your work, Mr. Laurette.

14:50.978 --> 14:53.894
This is the Shanghai Hotel.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.285
Yes. Ready for occupancy next summer.

14:56.285 --> 14:57.813
And the Berlin Concert Hall.

14:57.813 --> 15:00.918
A titanium roof in the shape of a violin.

15:00.918 --> 15:02.647
You have so many buildings,

15:02.647 --> 15:05.135
you could have your own city.

15:07.056 --> 15:08.518
The Gradowczyk proposal will be back

15:08.518 --> 15:10.616
from the printer tomorrow morning.

15:10.616 --> 15:13.107
Could you run it up to me in Litchfield?

15:13.107 --> 15:16.001
Yes, Mr. Laurette.

15:19.816 --> 15:22.409
Litchfield is where I live with my wife.

15:22.409 --> 15:24.080
We didn't realize you were married.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.921
You don't have any pictures.

15:25.921 --> 15:27.289
I don't need pictures of Sara

15:27.289 --> 15:29.347
to remind me I am married.

15:29.347 --> 15:31.593
But during the week you stay in town?

15:31.593 --> 15:33.182
When I am in town.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.427
Half of the time, I'm on the road.

15:35.427 --> 15:36.887
My wife is a landscape designer.

15:36.887 --> 15:38.690
She prefers staying up there

15:38.690 --> 15:40.635
with her gardens and lawns.

15:40.987 --> 15:45.804
And you stay here with your "garden."

15:45.804 --> 15:47.440
She doesn't mind?

15:47.440 --> 15:52.250
Twenty-eight years of marriage
have earned me a little trust.

15:53.214 --> 15:54.709
Look.

15:54.709 --> 15:57.769
What, you...
you found the hit-and-run?

15:57.769 --> 16:01.216
No. A murder victim.

16:01.773 --> 16:03.094
See this kid with a camera?

16:03.094 --> 16:04.304
That's Noah Preston,

16:04.304 --> 16:07.116
the young architect who died in Penn Station last week.

16:07.116 --> 16:08.618
I didn't even notice him at the site,

16:08.618 --> 16:10.518
not that I would have recognized him.

16:10.518 --> 16:12.112
That's what I couldn't put my finger on.

16:12.112 --> 16:14.991
Your design, it reminds me of Noah's.

16:14.991 --> 16:17.266
I inspire a lot of young architects,

16:17.266 --> 16:20.062
even to the point of plagiarism.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.613
What... What did they tell us?That it was...

16:23.613 --> 16:25.719
Well, his design was the sentimental favorite.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.910
And when the sentiment fades away,

16:27.910 --> 16:31.000
they run to the real thing,

16:32.962 --> 16:35.981
to the powerful vision.

16:35.981 --> 16:40.158
When you're done with the photos,
just leave them there.

16:44.644 --> 16:49.983
I guess modesty isn't a required
course in architecture school.

16:49.983 --> 16:51.608
I don't think that

16:51.608 --> 16:56.215
Laurette was wrong about Noah copying him.

16:56.215 --> 17:01.809
These last few photos that Noah took,

17:01.809 --> 17:04.954
they are taken from the...

17:04.954 --> 17:09.762
the same spot and from the same angle...

17:10.175 --> 17:12.770
Laurette took his.

17:16.211 --> 17:19.712
He stood in Laurette's footprints.

17:19.712 --> 17:25.172
Yeah. Maybe he did more than just stand.

17:27.092 --> 17:31.059
No record of any calls
between Noah's office and Laurette.

17:31.923 --> 17:33.658
Noah was connecting with Laurette

17:33.658 --> 17:36.247
on a whole other level.

17:36.247 --> 17:40.995
That's a museum complex
that Laurette designed in Barcelona.

17:40.995 --> 17:43.874
The layout...why does it look familiar?

17:43.874 --> 17:46.140
'Cause you've been there before.

17:46.140 --> 17:51.214
Noah used the same spatial
relationships in his apartment.

17:51.214 --> 17:54.478
He was trying to live inside Laurette's head.

17:54.478 --> 17:56.460
Well, if he wanted to get inside Laurette's head,

17:56.460 --> 17:59.673
he needed more blondes in his life.

18:04.478 --> 18:06.332
You know, Laurette

18:06.332 --> 18:11.224
designed three homes in Bergen County.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.724
Noah didn't have any projects in Jersey.

18:13.724 --> 18:15.777
Here.

18:15.777 --> 18:18.130
It's a receipt from
the Saddle River Building Department

18:18.130 --> 18:20.267
in Bergen County for blueprints

18:20.267 --> 18:23.719
of the Laurette homes.

18:25.517 --> 18:27.084
Jared will be coming down from Dartmouth

18:27.084 --> 18:29.437
next week with his new girlfriend.

18:29.437 --> 18:30.672
Another one?

18:30.672 --> 18:34.118
I didn't realize accounting majors were so lucky.

18:34.118 --> 18:36.771
He's hoping to spend a day with you in the city.

18:36.771 --> 18:39.687
I can't. I have to be in Chicago.

18:39.687 --> 18:42.506
Hello, Sara! Hello, Ben.

18:42.506 --> 18:43.949
Congratulations.

18:43.949 --> 18:46.646
Howard heard you were a shoo-in
for the downtown project.

18:46.646 --> 18:50.008
I'm just happy the old dog's
still in the running.

18:50.008 --> 18:52.254
Excuse me.

18:53.706 --> 18:55.324
Laurette here.

18:55.324 --> 18:59.015
Yes, I just got to Chicago an hour ago.

18:59.015 --> 19:02.993
I miss you too.How are you feeling?

19:02.993 --> 19:06.905
Just one more weekend,
then I'll be all yours.

19:06.905 --> 19:10.661
Oh. The people I'm meeting just got here.

19:10.661 --> 19:12.644
I love you too.

19:12.644 --> 19:15.461
Bye.

19:16.892 --> 19:18.226
I'm not sure.

19:18.226 --> 19:19.542
People from the county office said

19:19.542 --> 19:22.037
he asked for directions to all the houses.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.163
A lot of people stop by to see the house.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.738
Sometimes they wanna look inside.

19:25.738 --> 19:28.575
I hate to say no,
but I don't like strangers in the house.

19:28.575 --> 19:30.237
Serves you and your husband right

19:30.237 --> 19:32.157
for buying such a famous house.

19:32.157 --> 19:34.157
I'm not married.

19:34.157 --> 19:36.969
We've seen the other
two Laurette homes in the area,

19:36.969 --> 19:37.702
and they're a mess.

19:37.702 --> 19:40.973
This one's in original condition.

19:42.243 --> 19:44.368
What... What do you do for a living?

19:44.368 --> 19:45.961
I'm an archivist.

19:45.961 --> 19:48.346
I work from home.

19:49.596 --> 19:51.382
You must be doing well.

19:51.382 --> 19:52.694
It's a beautiful house.

19:52.694 --> 19:56.035
Can we see the rest of it?

19:58.018 --> 20:01.038
I guess strangers with badges
aren't exactly strangers.

20:01.038 --> 20:03.000
This is incredible.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.508
This is the original custom-made furniture, isn't it?

20:06.508 --> 20:08.650
Laurette designed it all.

20:08.650 --> 20:10.123
It came with the house.

20:10.123 --> 20:12.820
You kept Laurette's layout.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.584
The absence of personal effects...

20:15.584 --> 20:17.403
that's another Laurette touch.

20:17.403 --> 20:19.813
I didn't think it needed anything else.

20:19.813 --> 20:22.376
It's the way Laurette would have it...

20:22.376 --> 20:23.829
If Laurette lived here.

20:23.829 --> 20:27.622
That's my taxi.
I have a doctor's appointment.

20:27.622 --> 20:30.253
Are you sure that we can't give you a ride?

20:30.253 --> 20:31.300
Oh, that's very kind of you.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.832
I have a taxi service practically on retainer.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.351
I was just too nervous driving.

20:35.351 --> 20:38.371
You know how it is.
You can never be too careful.

20:44.422 --> 20:46.129
New house, new car,

20:46.129 --> 20:48.842
all on an archivist's salary.

20:48.842 --> 20:52.189
You think Laurette's got himself a pregnant mistress?

20:53.801 --> 20:55.907
At least.

20:55.907 --> 20:58.884
See the window on the far side of the house?

20:58.884 --> 21:01.398
That's the master bedroom.

21:01.398 --> 21:05.147
It's a different design than the original.

21:05.147 --> 21:08.280
See, the sash has been cut out in the shape of a dome

21:08.280 --> 21:11.626
surrounded by laurel leaves...

21:11.626 --> 21:13.732
to evoke the Taj Mahal,

21:13.732 --> 21:16.250
which was built by the maharajah

21:16.250 --> 21:18.376
in honor of his wife.

21:18.376 --> 21:20.123
This is a decorative detail that

21:20.123 --> 21:22.967
Laurette has used before.

21:22.967 --> 21:25.067
He used it...

21:25.067 --> 21:30.606
in the house that he built in Litchfield for his wife, Sara.

21:32.017 --> 21:35.344
"The Taj Mahal is the greatest monument to love ever built.

21:35.344 --> 21:37.318
And it's my way of letting people know

21:37.318 --> 21:39.831
I built this house for my wife."

21:39.831 --> 21:43.577
And he's done the same thing here.

21:44.439 --> 21:47.053
Ms. Breen isn't his mistress.

21:47.053 --> 21:48.825
She's his wife...

21:48.825 --> 21:51.681
his other wife.

21:54.458 --> 21:57.436
Meredith Breen is on the tax rolls as the sole owner.

21:57.436 --> 21:59.132
But we pulled the deed from the county

21:59.132 --> 22:02.132
and found a quitclaim signed by Laurette,

22:02.132 --> 22:06.128
giving up any claim he might have
on the house as Meredith's husband.

22:06.128 --> 22:07.382
And the first wife?

22:07.382 --> 22:09.099
Sara. As far as we know,

22:09.099 --> 22:11.719
she's alive and well and living in Litchfield.

22:11.719 --> 22:13.029
Maybe they were divorced.

22:13.029 --> 22:14.622
Not that we could find in the New York

22:14.622 --> 22:16.791
or Connecticut records.

22:16.791 --> 22:20.988
Noah Preston was obsessed with Laurette.

22:20.988 --> 22:23.318
If he knew about his two wives,

22:23.318 --> 22:25.404
he might've tried to blackmail

22:25.404 --> 22:28.029
Laurette into being his silent partner.

22:28.029 --> 22:31.110
Before we condemn
Mr. Laurette as a bigamist,

22:31.110 --> 22:35.553
make sure he didn't get
a quickie divorce from his first wife.

22:37.798 --> 22:40.371
He might have called under some pretense...

22:40.371 --> 22:42.252
asking about your marriage.

22:42.252 --> 22:45.713
Our marriage?
Humph. No secrets there.

22:45.713 --> 22:47.244
Twenty-eight years, two kids.

22:47.244 --> 22:49.815
We muddle through.
We still love each other.

22:49.815 --> 22:51.759
That's nice to hear.

22:51.759 --> 22:54.310
His name was Noah Preston.

22:54.310 --> 22:57.328
Preston? He wrote me a letter two months ago.

22:57.328 --> 22:59.453
He said he was a student at Madison.

22:59.453 --> 23:03.225
He wanted to ask me about
my influence on Ben's work.

23:03.225 --> 23:04.420
Then you talked to him?

23:04.420 --> 23:05.567
No.

23:05.567 --> 23:10.149
Ben likes to maintain a certain mystique about his process.

23:10.149 --> 23:13.934
The mystique of a solitary genius.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.342
Well, not all that solitary.

23:16.342 --> 23:18.831
He surrounds himself with young, attractive,

23:18.831 --> 23:22.797
uh, architects.

23:23.584 --> 23:26.701
You noticed that, didn't you?

23:26.701 --> 23:28.156
It really doesn't bother you?

23:28.156 --> 23:30.464
Those little girls are no threat.

23:30.464 --> 23:34.562
Ben and I have teetered on
the brink of disaster many times.

23:34.562 --> 23:35.895
We've survived it all.

23:35.895 --> 23:37.583
What kind of disasters?

23:37.583 --> 23:38.468
You name it.

23:38.468 --> 23:40.836
Architecture is feast or famine,

23:40.836 --> 23:45.153
even for someone with seven world-class buildings to his credit.

23:45.153 --> 23:50.026
Winning the commission
for the downtown project will be a godsend.

23:50.026 --> 23:51.968
Oh, just for our information,

23:51.968 --> 23:54.748
was your husband here
last Wednesday night?

23:54.748 --> 23:56.969
No. He was in Boston for a few days

23:56.969 --> 23:59.093
meeting with the Civic Planning Council.

23:59.093 --> 24:00.687
He goes every month.

24:00.687 --> 24:04.953
He's had one project or
another there the last dozen years.

24:07.050 --> 24:08.691
The Boston Planning Council has nothing

24:08.691 --> 24:10.536
on the books about a meeting with Laurette.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.362
In fact, the last time they discussed a project

24:12.362 --> 24:15.194
with him was eight years ago.

24:15.194 --> 24:19.472
Yeah. Yes.Okay. Thanks.

24:19.472 --> 24:21.290
Credit card company is going to fax over

24:21.290 --> 24:24.516
Laurette's transactions from the last month.

24:24.516 --> 24:27.310
Sara Laurette has no idea who she's married to.

24:27.310 --> 24:28.945
She's right about feast or famine.

24:28.945 --> 24:31.864
He's had three bankruptcies on his record.

24:31.864 --> 24:34.758
I have to pay my bills the day they come.

24:36.110 --> 24:40.430
Well, some people can't function
unless they're in a crisis mode.

24:40.430 --> 24:43.649
You know,they need the stimulus.

24:47.465 --> 24:52.111
All these charges are in the city or in Litchfield.

24:52.111 --> 24:54.472
These are for another card in Laurette's name,

24:54.472 --> 24:55.596
with charges in Bergen County.

24:55.596 --> 24:58.656
Must be the card Meredith uses.

25:02.491 --> 25:05.494
Oh, there's a third card under Laurette's name.

25:05.494 --> 25:07.267
All the charges are in Concord,

25:07.267 --> 25:09.405
outside of Boston.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.435
Right. My son had his soccer team over,

25:13.435 --> 25:15.928
and we charged pizzas on the card.

25:15.928 --> 25:18.075
The restaurant just gave you our address like that?

25:18.075 --> 25:19.403
Well, they didn't really have a choice.

25:19.403 --> 25:22.200
Are you a relative of Ben Laurette?

25:22.200 --> 25:23.328
That's a silly question.

25:23.328 --> 25:25.960
I'm Benny's wife, Sydney Laurette.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.410
That's our son, Jason.

25:28.410 --> 25:31.125
Oh. Well, I mean,
we knew he was married,

25:31.125 --> 25:33.625
we just pictured someone,

25:33.625 --> 25:37.317
um... older.

25:37.317 --> 25:40.176
Well, you must be thinking of his first wife, Sara.

25:40.176 --> 25:43.031
Benny was already divorced when I met him.

25:44.260 --> 25:45.918
Are you involved in architecture?

25:45.918 --> 25:47.911
No. That's Benny's thing.

25:47.911 --> 25:49.593
That's why we clicked.

25:49.593 --> 25:52.660
He's able to get away from that
world when we're together.

25:52.660 --> 25:54.650
We're looking into a stalking incident

25:54.650 --> 25:57.145
last week involving your husband.

25:57.145 --> 25:58.168
Was he here?

25:58.168 --> 25:59.519
Yes.

25:59.519 --> 26:01.743
He drove in from New York Wednesday morning.

26:01.743 --> 26:03.117
And Wednesday night...

26:03.117 --> 26:04.429
did he spend it at home?

26:04.429 --> 26:07.918
He went into Boston to meet
with the Planning Council.

26:07.918 --> 26:09.342
Then he had to wait for some blueprints

26:09.342 --> 26:11.710
he was having delivered from his office.

26:11.710 --> 26:14.343
He was home shortly after midnight.

26:14.343 --> 26:16.023
Who's this stalker?

26:16.023 --> 26:18.564
It's an architect. Uh, Noah Preston.

26:18.564 --> 26:22.256
He was passing himself off
as a student at Madison University.

26:22.256 --> 26:25.804
Oh. I got a call about him.

26:25.804 --> 26:27.116
A few weeks ago,

26:27.116 --> 26:28.863
someone from that school called...

26:28.863 --> 26:30.136
and said there was a kid

26:30.136 --> 26:31.517
claiming to be a student...

26:31.517 --> 26:33.208
who was contacting people to

26:33.208 --> 26:36.243
get information about Ben.

26:36.243 --> 26:41.446
Oh? And this person
from Madison University,

26:41.446 --> 26:42.674
did they leave their name?

26:42.674 --> 26:44.156
No.

26:44.156 --> 26:45.242
But it was a woman.

26:45.242 --> 26:48.998
She said she was in their
architecture department.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.900
No?

26:50.900 --> 26:53.613
All right. Thank you very much.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.658
No one in the architecture
department called her.

26:55.658 --> 26:57.822
They weren't even aware of
what Noah was doing.

26:57.822 --> 26:59.806
Well, if Laurette wanted to know

26:59.806 --> 27:03.512
how much Noah knew
about his marriages,

27:03.512 --> 27:08.010
then he might've had
someone call Sydney...to see

27:08.010 --> 27:10.298
if she had been contacted by Noah.

27:10.298 --> 27:13.355
Who would he have gotten to make that call?

27:13.355 --> 27:17.615
One of his starstruck architecture divas?

27:17.615 --> 27:20.615
Or maybe another wife.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.235
They showed me a photograph of this architect...

27:24.235 --> 27:25.300
Noah something.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.021
He was murdered last week.

27:27.021 --> 27:29.369
They wanted to know
if he'd come to the house.

27:29.369 --> 27:32.311
They came by my office too.

27:32.311 --> 27:34.050
But what does he have to do with us?

27:34.050 --> 27:36.477
Did he wanna hurt you?

27:36.477 --> 27:38.937
Meredith,

27:38.937 --> 27:43.302
you know I love you and our baby.

27:44.797 --> 27:48.330
But I haven't always been an altar boy.

27:49.621 --> 27:52.724
Ben, altar boys are boring.

27:52.724 --> 27:55.234
I appreciate you saying that, but...

27:55.234 --> 27:57.786
I was thinking when you
go to Boston next week,

27:57.786 --> 27:59.074
I'll go with you,

27:59.074 --> 28:02.288
and when you're done with your meetings,
we could go to Nantucket.

28:02.288 --> 28:06.912
I'd feel guilty thinking of you moping
around that hotel room.

28:07.494 --> 28:10.732
Well, I don't want you feeling guilty.

28:10.732 --> 28:14.727
We'll just have to make
the most of our time here.

28:22.957 --> 28:25.122
We found blood on the driver's seat

28:25.122 --> 28:26.896
and on this part of the center console.

28:26.896 --> 28:29.692
No blood on the passenger seat.

28:29.692 --> 28:31.797
Noah was sitting here.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.186
The wound was here.

28:33.186 --> 28:36.957
If he was facing forward,
there'd be blood on the dash.

28:39.166 --> 28:42.691
Maybe Noah's head was
turned to the right

28:42.691 --> 28:43.985
when he was stabbed.

28:43.985 --> 28:46.248
There would be blood
on the passenger seat.

28:46.248 --> 28:48.834
Yeah, unless...

28:48.834 --> 28:50.608
they had to put the seat back

28:50.608 --> 28:52.972
to get at the air bags.

28:52.972 --> 28:57.641
Maybe the seat was here.

28:58.481 --> 29:01.210
That's why there's no blood on the seat,

29:02.418 --> 29:05.543
but on the floor.

29:14.214 --> 29:16.400
We got blood here.

29:20.864 --> 29:23.496
There's not much room to sit up there.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.477
The killer had to be sitting back here.

29:25.477 --> 29:28.639
Noah was looking towards the killer.

29:28.639 --> 29:31.093
The killer swung the screwdriver,
caught him in the neck.

29:31.093 --> 29:33.367
So the killer wasn't sitting in the front seat.

29:33.367 --> 29:35.663
Right.

29:35.663 --> 29:37.192
Because, uh,

29:37.192 --> 29:41.429
air bags are a hazard for pregnant women.

29:41.429 --> 29:46.091
Especially pregnant women
who can never be too careful.

29:48.015 --> 29:49.995
If Noah blew the whistle on Laurette,

29:49.995 --> 29:52.284
his marriage to Meredith would be invalidated.

29:52.284 --> 29:54.008
His business would take a financial hit.

29:54.008 --> 29:56.031
She couldn't count on him for child support.

29:56.031 --> 29:57.449
Yeah, but a pregnant killer?

29:57.449 --> 30:00.394
She's the only one who lied about
being married to Laurette.

30:00.394 --> 30:03.292
She had no reason to,
except to protect his secret.

30:03.292 --> 30:06.066
Well, if Noah told her about the other wives,

30:06.066 --> 30:09.764
she was just trying to salvage what she could.

30:09.764 --> 30:13.228
But if she's known all along...

30:13.228 --> 30:16.574
that's the more intriguing possibility.

30:16.574 --> 30:19.858
Until you nail down her motive,
I'm keeping Laurette at the top of my list.

30:19.858 --> 30:21.080
The classic questions.

30:21.080 --> 30:25.133
What did Meredith know 
and when did she know it?

30:25.133 --> 30:27.101
Bergen County
Clerk's Office
Hackensack, New Jersey
Mondya, April 7

30:27.101 --> 30:31.142
The local college invited Mr. Laurette
to do a weekend seminar.

30:31.142 --> 30:33.384
They asked us to compile some records,

30:33.384 --> 30:35.724
but since Meredith was the archivist for the county,

30:35.724 --> 30:36.832
she got the assignment.

30:36.832 --> 30:39.505
That's how they met
over some dusty papers?

30:39.505 --> 30:42.608
They weren't dusty by the time
she got through with them.

30:42.608 --> 30:45.566
She compiled a detailed document...

30:45.566 --> 30:48.529
of all the time that Mr. Laurette
spent in Bergen County.

30:48.529 --> 30:50.300
She had the whole thing bound in leather

30:50.300 --> 30:52.140
and then she even made a copy,

30:52.140 --> 30:55.579
which she then presented personally to Mr. Laurette.

30:55.579 --> 30:57.961
She'd done presentations
before to local dignitaries,

30:57.961 --> 31:00.395
but never on this scale.

31:00.395 --> 31:02.596
This is the scale that would be needed
to get Laurette's attention.

31:02.596 --> 31:07.010
Look, she even included
a picture of Laurette and his wife, Sara,

31:07.010 --> 31:09.470
- in 1976.
- Meredith always said that Mr. Laurette
was a devoted husband,

31:09.470 --> 31:11.634
but I think she knew more about

31:11.634 --> 31:15.546
his personal life than he did.

31:15.546 --> 31:20.335
You know, we're gonna need to
borrow this for our investigation.

31:21.199 --> 31:25.136
Uh, I'll just fill out some forms.

31:26.734 --> 31:30.407
The devoted husband with
enough devotion for three wives.

31:30.407 --> 31:33.776
Sounds like Meredith went into
this marriage with both eyes open.

31:33.776 --> 31:35.920
Best of all for her,

31:35.920 --> 31:38.496
the rat was probably unaware

31:38.496 --> 31:41.627
she was onto his dirty little secrets.

31:41.627 --> 31:44.023
What fun she must have pushing his buttons.

31:44.023 --> 31:46.170
She pushed the biggest one with this.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.763
I mean, a man turns 60,

31:47.763 --> 31:51.147
he starts thinking about
how he's gonna be remembered.

31:51.147 --> 31:56.265
Who better to preserve
his legacy than a trained archivist?

31:56.265 --> 31:58.839
The question is did she
act alone or did Ben help her?

31:58.839 --> 32:00.965
He's still unaccounted for that night.

32:00.965 --> 32:04.920
Sydney, the... the wife in Concord,

32:04.920 --> 32:07.940
she said that he was in Boston that night...

32:07.940 --> 32:11.166
waiting for blueprints
to be delivered from his office.

32:11.166 --> 32:13.640
Well, maybe he was.

32:13.640 --> 32:17.823
You remember how much
Laurette likes personal deliveries.

32:17.823 --> 32:21.391
Right. The blonder the better.

32:22.110 --> 32:24.625
Mr. Laurette needed those plans
for the Boston Planning Council.

32:24.625 --> 32:26.147
He couldn't wait for next-day delivery.

32:26.147 --> 32:28.156
No, see, your boss isn't doing any business

32:28.156 --> 32:31.634
with the Boston Planning Council.

32:31.634 --> 32:35.144
We think the business
he had was with you.

32:35.144 --> 32:37.399
So what if it was?

32:37.399 --> 32:39.405
Did his wife put you up to this?

32:39.405 --> 32:41.265
Why would you think that?

32:41.265 --> 32:45.690
He's always this close from getting busted.

32:45.690 --> 32:47.308
It's almost like he does it on purpose.

32:47.308 --> 32:51.093
You can be sure that he does it on purpose.

32:51.093 --> 32:53.545
Well, aren't those nights with him

32:53.545 --> 32:56.407
more passionate...in those times

32:56.407 --> 32:58.442
when he nearly gets caught?

32:58.442 --> 33:01.812
Well, you can thank his wife for me.

33:01.812 --> 33:04.611
Because that night in Boston,
after she called...

33:04.611 --> 33:06.117
His wife Sara called him?

33:06.117 --> 33:07.751
On his cell.

33:08.617 --> 33:13.044
Sounded like she was on her way
up to Boston to surprise him.

33:13.044 --> 33:16.022
You heard his side of the conversation?

33:16.022 --> 33:17.241
Yes.

33:17.241 --> 33:19.572
He was sweatin' big ones
to change her mind.

33:19.572 --> 33:23.774
He told her it would be 4:00
in the morning before she got in.

33:24.841 --> 33:26.484
What time was the call?

33:26.484 --> 33:28.260
Just after 10:00.

33:28.260 --> 33:29.561
Thank you, Ms. Spooner.

33:29.561 --> 33:32.602
The officer will show you downstairs.

33:37.315 --> 33:38.661
That alibis Laurette,

33:38.661 --> 33:40.756
but the call had to be Meredith.

33:40.756 --> 33:43.588
Yeah. She probably thought that he was with Sydney,

33:43.588 --> 33:45.774
and she was toying with him.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.294
She called around 10:00.

33:47.294 --> 33:49.759
If she was driving,
she'd be in Boston around 2:00 a. M,

33:49.759 --> 33:51.178
not 4:00.

33:51.178 --> 33:54.566
She had to be on the 12:00 train.

33:54.566 --> 33:57.692
She probably called from Penn Station.

33:57.692 --> 33:59.347
That puts her at the murder scene.

33:59.347 --> 34:01.128
Laurette will never admit she called him.

34:01.128 --> 34:03.597
He'd have to give up his precious secrets.

34:03.597 --> 34:07.677
Meredith might give them up for him.

34:09.356 --> 34:13.476
She thinks that she's
the last stop on Laurette's train.

34:13.476 --> 34:15.777
She could be wrong.

34:15.777 --> 34:20.326
Well, we'd still need Laurette to give her up.

34:24.976 --> 34:27.286
He might...

34:27.286 --> 34:32.199
once he realizes exactly who she killed.

34:38.746 --> 34:40.764
The card worked fine yesterday.

34:40.764 --> 34:42.929
They want to talk to you.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.308
Yes?

34:46.308 --> 34:50.541
Yes, I'm aware Mr. Laurette has
two other cards on that account.

34:50.541 --> 34:52.978
But... No, two other cards.

34:52.978 --> 34:55.252
Three total.

34:55.731 --> 34:57.816
What do you mean "a fourth card"?

34:57.816 --> 35:00.264
Where?

35:00.264 --> 35:03.673
Tell the client it's a privilege
to live in one of my buildings.

35:03.673 --> 35:05.123
If he...

35:05.123 --> 35:05.925
Meredith?

35:05.925 --> 35:07.728
I'm sorry,Mr. Laurette.

35:07.728 --> 35:09.091
It's all right. Leave us alone.

35:09.091 --> 35:11.459
Richard, I have to call you back.

35:13.872 --> 35:14.902
Meredith.

35:14.902 --> 35:16.212
I was buying clothes for our baby,

35:16.212 --> 35:17.932
and they refused my card.

35:17.932 --> 35:20.239
And I found out why.
There's another card on your account.

35:20.239 --> 35:20.417
That can't be.

35:20.417 --> 35:23.318
There are a dozen charges all around Mount Kisco.

35:23.318 --> 35:25.722
Charges for lingerie,
bed linens. Who is she?

35:25.722 --> 35:27.350
No one. I swear.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.189
Mr. Laurette,I'm sorry to disturb you...

35:29.189 --> 35:33.096
We're sorry to drop in on you like this.

35:33.096 --> 35:35.039
Well, what a surprise.

35:35.039 --> 35:37.144
So you know Mr. Laurette after all?

35:37.144 --> 35:38.246
I never said I didn't.

35:38.246 --> 35:39.456
What is it you want?

35:39.456 --> 35:42.703
Uh, it's in connection with Noah Preston.

35:42.703 --> 35:43.842
We found documents that show

35:43.842 --> 35:45.751
he was looking into some transactions

35:45.751 --> 35:47.673
you made up in Mount Kisco.

35:47.673 --> 35:50.268
I don't have anything
to do with Mount Kisco.

35:50.268 --> 35:53.776
Look, we can get into
that after Ms. Breen leaves.

35:53.776 --> 35:54.804
I'm not leaving.

35:54.804 --> 35:57.782
Well, this really doesn't concern you.

35:58.790 --> 36:02.360
Whatever concerns my husband concerns me.

36:03.488 --> 36:04.473
She's your wife?

36:04.473 --> 36:06.887
Yes, I'm his wife.

36:06.887 --> 36:08.023
The wife that you told us

36:08.023 --> 36:10.094
you've been living with for 28 years?

36:10.094 --> 36:12.481
If you mean Sara,
he was married to her for 26 years.

36:12.481 --> 36:14.302
He divorced her before he married me.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.265
Why didn't you tell us you were married?

36:16.265 --> 36:20.484
Well, Ben is so well-known
and I value my privacy.

36:20.484 --> 36:22.407
Now, what about these transactions in Mount Kisco?

36:22.407 --> 36:24.636
You husband bought a house there two months ago.

36:24.636 --> 36:26.146
That's not true.

36:26.146 --> 36:28.579
Uh, now, we had a look at it.

36:28.579 --> 36:30.417
There were new windows installed.

36:30.417 --> 36:32.649
Windows with a, uh, uh...

36:32.649 --> 36:34.090
a personal touch.

36:34.090 --> 36:36.834
The "Laurette touch."

36:36.834 --> 36:38.944
See? The sashes have been cut out.

36:38.944 --> 36:40.508
It...

36:40.508 --> 36:42.614
Well, It...

36:42.614 --> 36:44.932
it looks like the Taj Mahal.

36:44.932 --> 36:47.958
You have windows like these
on your house in Litchfield.

36:47.958 --> 36:49.184
Yes.

36:49.184 --> 36:50.978
And come to think of it,

36:50.978 --> 36:54.528
you have windows like these too.

36:55.149 --> 36:58.454
This Taj Mahal design,

36:58.454 --> 37:01.863
uh, do you have any idea what it means?

37:01.863 --> 37:03.211
You son of a bitch!

37:03.211 --> 37:05.296
Meredith, it's not true!

37:05.296 --> 37:06.510
Then who's this?

37:06.510 --> 37:07.639
Why are you marrying her?

37:07.639 --> 37:08.845
Marrying her? How could he?

37:08.845 --> 37:10.457
He's married to you.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.182
Oh, that wouldn't stop him.

37:14.182 --> 37:16.249
He's got two other wives,

37:16.249 --> 37:18.425
Sara and Sydney.

37:18.425 --> 37:21.714
He's still married to them.

37:21.714 --> 37:23.904
You...

37:23.904 --> 37:25.238
You knew?

37:25.238 --> 37:27.041
Yes, I knew.

37:27.041 --> 37:28.702
And I didn't care,

37:28.702 --> 37:31.048
because I was the most important.

37:31.048 --> 37:32.970
Remember what you said?

37:32.970 --> 37:36.460
I was the only one you'd trust
to be the guardian of your memory,

37:36.460 --> 37:39.115
of the legend of Benjamin Laurette.

37:39.115 --> 37:41.808
Well, here's your legend!

37:43.332 --> 37:44.335
Meredith!

37:44.335 --> 37:45.992
I'm getting a lawyer and I'm suing!

37:45.992 --> 37:48.161
Hey, hey, y-you can't leave now.

37:48.161 --> 37:51.000
Not when the cat's out of the bag,
right, Mr. Laurette?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.903
I don't have to explain myself to you.

37:52.903 --> 37:55.883
It's between me and the people I love.

37:57.703 --> 37:59.185
I couldn't divorce Sara.

37:59.185 --> 38:01.091
It would have broken her heart.

38:01.091 --> 38:02.194
And Sydney...

38:02.194 --> 38:04.557
I just couldn't say no to Sydney.And,

38:04.557 --> 38:09.145
Meredith, you are so devoted to me,
to my work.

38:10.396 --> 38:14.782
Uh, we have proof of that devotion.

38:15.849 --> 38:20.088
Every step that you took that summer in 1976,

38:20.088 --> 38:22.968
Meredith documented in this book.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.743
Every meal, every liaison.

38:27.443 --> 38:29.919
And...

38:29.919 --> 38:33.010
this young woman here
that you're sitting next to.

38:33.010 --> 38:36.052
She was staying at your hotel.

38:36.052 --> 38:37.308
You remember her name?

38:37.308 --> 38:38.111
Jane Ward?

38:38.111 --> 38:40.705
Yes, Jane. It sounds familiar.

38:40.705 --> 38:42.001
Yeah. You had a fling with her.

38:42.001 --> 38:43.844
I remember.

38:43.844 --> 38:46.680
Well, here she is in Meredith's book.

38:51.532 --> 38:53.358
I mean, how could you not be moved

38:53.358 --> 38:56.154
by Meredith's dedication?

38:56.154 --> 39:00.886
Now, here was someone who loved you.

39:00.886 --> 39:04.191
I mean, not for you...
I mean, who needs that?

39:04.191 --> 39:10.398
Meredith loved the legend of you.

39:11.097 --> 39:14.913
The, uh... The master of...

39:14.913 --> 39:19.256
rising steel and glass.

39:19.256 --> 39:21.765
Meredith,

39:21.765 --> 39:24.169
I am sorry.

39:24.169 --> 39:26.152
Oh, don't be sorry for her.

39:26.152 --> 39:28.258
Knowing your secret gave her power.

39:28.258 --> 39:32.744
She was the tail wagging the dog.

39:33.769 --> 39:39.072
She would call you, wouldn't she,
when you were at Sara or Sydney's?

39:39.072 --> 39:40.222
She tell you that she was on her way,

39:40.222 --> 39:41.606
she was gonna come see you?

39:41.606 --> 39:42.994
No, no. I never did that.

39:42.994 --> 39:44.448
How about a couple weeks ago...

39:44.448 --> 39:46.449
Penn Station,you were getting a train?

39:46.449 --> 39:49.490
I never called him from Penn Station.

39:50.251 --> 39:52.665
Is that right, Ben?

39:55.442 --> 39:57.769
Huh?

39:59.874 --> 40:01.837
It would've been right after she killed Noah Preston.

40:01.837 --> 40:02.762
What?

40:02.762 --> 40:04.560
After Noah showed up at her door,

40:04.560 --> 40:07.114
she worried he might blow the whistle on you.

40:07.114 --> 40:10.339
So we think she visited him at his home,

40:10.339 --> 40:12.871
and then she asked him to drive her to Penn Station.

40:12.871 --> 40:14.061
She sat in the backseat,

40:14.061 --> 40:16.048
because you can never be too careful.

40:16.048 --> 40:18.093
After she stabbed him,

40:18.093 --> 40:20.113
she ran into the station and called you,

40:20.113 --> 40:21.778
played her little game with you.

40:21.778 --> 40:23.784
Don't listen to them.

40:23.784 --> 40:26.701
She had a right to be worried about Noah.

40:26.701 --> 40:30.068
He was fixated on you.

40:30.068 --> 40:31.898
Even his designs,

40:31.898 --> 40:34.044
they reminded people of your energy.

40:34.044 --> 40:36.882
He was an imitator of no consequence.!

40:36.882 --> 40:41.428
No, he was of every consequence to you.

40:42.578 --> 40:45.295
Jane Ward.

40:48.967 --> 40:53.047
You were her last fling as a single girl.

40:53.873 --> 40:56.258
A month after this photograph was taken,

40:56.258 --> 41:00.761
she married her fiance, James Preston.

41:00.761 --> 41:03.212
A few months later,

41:03.212 --> 41:07.154
she gave birth to a son.

41:07.154 --> 41:09.316
Noah.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.809
Your son, Ben,

41:15.897 --> 41:18.996
your creation,

41:18.996 --> 41:23.771
whose every design reflected you.

41:26.141 --> 41:28.771
Noah would've carried the Laurette style

41:28.771 --> 41:32.791
far into the 21 st century.

41:34.859 --> 41:37.229
Come on, Ben.

41:37.229 --> 41:39.317
Did she call you from Penn Station, Ben?

41:39.317 --> 41:42.051
Ben, don't.

41:44.786 --> 41:48.664
You...

41:49.182 --> 41:51.368
You... bitch!

41:51.368 --> 41:53.393
You killed him...

41:53.393 --> 41:55.090
my future!

41:55.090 --> 41:57.117
I'm carrying your future!

41:57.117 --> 41:59.263
That?

41:59.263 --> 42:02.307
I don't know what that is.

42:02.307 --> 42:05.631
But this was real. He was real.

42:08.691 --> 42:11.792
Yes, she called me from the station.

42:11.792 --> 42:15.406
She said she had a ticket
for the 12:00 train to Boston.

42:15.406 --> 42:17.510
You filthy egomaniac.!

42:17.510 --> 42:19.233
Don't you get it?

42:19.233 --> 42:21.153
He would've ruined everything!

42:21.153 --> 42:23.013
You would have lost the commission!

42:23.013 --> 42:24.988
He would have won...

42:24.988 --> 42:26.850
my son!

42:26.850 --> 42:29.770
A Laurette would have won!

42:29.770 --> 42:32.821
Meredith Breen, you're under arrest for murder.

42:32.821 --> 42:34.946
Let's be careful.

42:40.004 --> 42:42.884
Mr. Laurette,

42:44.178 --> 42:47.593
you're gonna have to come
downtown and make a statement.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.887
Please.

43:01.279 --> 43:02.713
For a guy who likes chaos,

43:02.713 --> 43:05.611
he's about to get it in spades.

43:06.616 --> 43:09.963
Well, buildings may crumble,

43:09.963 --> 43:13.119
but infamy's forever.
