00:28.120 --> 00:29.640
- Patrick?
-Do not scream.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.680
You don't wanna kill me,

00:30.760 --> 00:33.280
-no matter what's happened.
-Be quiet. I'm trying to think.

00:33.880 --> 00:34.840
Patrick?!

00:35.240 --> 00:37.320
-Scream and you're both dead.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.480
Scream and you're killing her
as well as yourself,

00:39.560 --> 00:40.680
I promise you.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.520
Patrick, what have you done with Olivia?

01:00.600 --> 01:01.800
I think she's gone.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.280
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.440
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.800
We can talk about this
because Olivia needs you.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.320
Patrick, we can figure it out.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.000
It's too late. I'm screwed.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.560
I know how this works.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.440
-You're gonna say whatever it takes to--

01:17.280 --> 01:18.280
You stay there.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.840
Patrick, what's going on?

01:23.760 --> 01:24.800
Patrick!

01:24.880 --> 01:26.000
Get off me!

01:26.080 --> 01:27.080
Get off!

01:27.160 --> 01:29.040
-Get off!
-Shit.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.560
Help!

02:03.560 --> 02:04.840
Help me!

02:10.760 --> 02:12.440
No!

02:18.400 --> 02:20.080
Police. I need to use your phone.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.560
Where are the keys?

02:21.640 --> 02:23.040
Where are your car keys?

02:42.280 --> 02:44.640
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

02:44.720 --> 02:47.360
<i>♪ Danger knocking at my door ♪</i>

02:47.440 --> 02:50.240
<i>♪ Don't come 'round here no more ♪</i>

02:50.320 --> 02:52.720
<i>♪ I check the locks</i>
<i>Shut the windows down ♪</i>

02:53.240 --> 02:55.760
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

03:04.120 --> 03:06.760
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

03:16.360 --> 03:18.800
-What have you got?
-Everyone has to pay their taxes.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.360
Christine... Killane.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.120
Despite the dubious way she earns
her money, blackmailing people,

03:25.200 --> 03:26.880
she has a part-time job in a cinema.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.040
-A cinema?
-Mm.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.760
Work address, home address,
take your pick.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.160
HMRC had her payroll come in
on the 13th of the month so...

03:34.160 --> 03:36.360
What's that? A week ago?
So that means she was there then.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.040
Give me her home address.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.560
You got a pen?

03:39.640 --> 03:40.720
You didn't get this from me.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.880
All right?

03:42.360 --> 03:43.200
Okay.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.320
Are you okay?!

03:54.720 --> 03:56.080
Katz's ex-wife's in there.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.240
She's got a head injury.
I've called an ambulance.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.880
-ETA, eight minutes.
-Where is he?

03:59.960 --> 04:01.240
He's taken her car.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.280
We need to put an obs request on it,

04:03.360 --> 04:05.200
but she can't remember the registration.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.520
This is urgent because he's dangerous.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.880
-He has a gun.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.000
We need to track my phone.
He's taken that with him.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.120
Hello?

04:21.200 --> 04:22.800
Oh, hi. Can I speak to Johanna, please?

04:23.240 --> 04:24.240
This is her phone.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.880
It's Patrick here. I'm her colleague.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.360
Can I take a message?

04:29.440 --> 04:30.840
Yeah, it's Adam Price.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.360
Look, just tell her the stranger...

04:34.440 --> 04:36.120
<i>I've located her, she'll know what I mean.</i>

04:36.960 --> 04:38.120
Where are you now?

04:38.200 --> 04:41.160
I'm in town, but I'll text her
the location when I get there.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.080
Thanks.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.480
<i>I was approached by a woman,</i>
<i>a stranger,</i>

04:47.560 --> 04:48.920
<i>in her mid- to late 20s.</i>

04:49.000 --> 04:50.440
<i>She wore a baseball cap.</i>

05:03.000 --> 05:04.120
Oh, come on.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.560
Thanks a lot, boys.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.400
You hit him too hard.

07:22.840 --> 07:23.960
I think he's moving.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.040
Yeah, he's coming around.

07:28.760 --> 07:29.600
Adam?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.440
Are you okay?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.040
What are you doing here?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.200
I'm trying to find my wife.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.000
Where's my wife?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.400
She's not here.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.400
I confronted her with your secret.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.520
And she left.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.640
I thought you might know why.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.760
What...?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.720
All of this started with you.

08:18.800 --> 08:19.800
When you showed up.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.120
Secrets tear us apart.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.560
The truth gets lost
and then relationships fall apart.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.920
I don't care about secrets.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.080
I just want to find her!

08:35.160 --> 08:36.120
I know.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.440
I understand.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.440
Can you give us a minute?

08:47.280 --> 08:48.240
Are you sure?

08:52.560 --> 08:53.720
I'll be right outside.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.920
I expose secrets...

09:13.000 --> 09:14.800
for cash, usually.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.920
I know it's a lousy way
to earn a living but...

09:19.600 --> 09:20.880
it's like a mission.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.640
I just wanna blow apart all that deceit.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.960
You know, the Internet, it makes us
all think we're anonymous, but we're not.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.960
It's all there,

09:29.040 --> 09:30.360
if you know where to look.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.360
Yeah, well, thanks to you, she's gone.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.920
My mother left when I was young.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.760
Can you imagine what that does to a child?

09:38.320 --> 09:40.000
Knowing she had another life,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.120
knowing she'd rather live this other life

09:42.200 --> 09:43.720
than be with me.

09:44.680 --> 09:48.240
Thinking I must have done
something wrong to drive her away.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.840
But then, as I got older...

09:53.280 --> 09:54.480
I started to blame my dad.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.320
He must have driven her away.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.120
So I started to ask questions

10:00.200 --> 10:02.160
because there seems
to be so many fucking lies.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.560
And he got angry and it tore us apart.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.960
I had to find out the truth.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.000
I know Martin Killane is your father.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.640
And I know that he killed your mother.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.440
Imagine finding that out,

10:24.520 --> 10:26.800
thinking your life was one thing,

10:26.880 --> 10:29.120
one version of events, when actually...

10:31.600 --> 10:34.520
When I was 18 years old
I had an operation.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.880
I needed a donor.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.400
That's when I discovered
Martin wasn't my biological father.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.720
He never knew.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.160
He killed my mother because she was gonna
leave him and take me with her.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.960
He couldn't face it.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.600
Losing his wife and his child.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
But...

10:58.360 --> 10:59.800
I wasn't even his.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.240
I belonged to the man
she was having an affair with.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.400
Your father.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.520
Adam...

11:36.320 --> 11:37.520
me and you...

11:39.240 --> 11:40.280
we're...

11:48.640 --> 11:49.720
Untie me.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.200
Nobody move!

11:51.280 --> 11:52.520
Nobody fucking move!

11:52.600 --> 11:54.600
Okay? You stay there.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.560
-Let her go.
-You want me to let her go?

11:56.640 --> 11:57.880
Please, can you let her go?

11:58.760 --> 12:00.440
Of course, yeah, I'll let her go for you.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.800
-Happy?
-Thank you.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.400
My pleasure.
Nobody needs to get hurt.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.000
Oh, my--

12:14.280 --> 12:16.360
You know, you've caused me
a lot of problems.

12:22.640 --> 12:23.960
A lot of problems.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.880
You have information on somebody.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.600
Somebody very, very powerful.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.640
-That's my wife--
-Shut your fucking mouth!

12:37.160 --> 12:39.880
Kimberley Doyle.
You had to get involved, didn't you?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.600
Please, I'm sorry. Can you--?

12:41.680 --> 12:42.920
You had to stick your nose

12:43.000 --> 12:45.680
-where it wasn't meant to go.
-Please--

13:05.640 --> 13:06.960
-No!
-I

13:25.280 --> 13:26.240
Look at me.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.840
Ingrid, look at me.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.320
It's all right.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.440
Where's my wife?

13:30.520 --> 13:31.400
Where is she?

13:33.840 --> 13:35.680
What have you done with Corinne?

13:36.240 --> 13:39.320
Armed police! Stay on the floor.
Do not move!

13:40.600 --> 13:42.880
-Don't move!
-Two casualties. Gunshot wounds.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.960
We need an ambulance.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.440
I'm arresting you for the murder
of Heidi Doyle.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.040
You do not have to say anything.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.640
But it may harm your defense
if you do not mention, when questioned,

13:54.720 --> 13:56.840
something which you later
rely on in court.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.600
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.160
You pathetic piece of shit.

14:46.840 --> 14:47.840
Can I speak to her?

15:02.280 --> 15:03.640
I'm sorry about your friend.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.400
She was worried
things were getting too dangerous.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.120
I always convinced her it would be okay.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.520
Everything I did...

15:23.200 --> 15:24.360
my mission...

15:25.720 --> 15:27.360
exposing secrets...

15:29.480 --> 15:32.200
revealing the truth caused people to die.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.680
But I suppose that's what happens

15:38.760 --> 15:40.200
when you mess with people's lives.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.240
You saved me.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.000
You could have died.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.200
You're my brother.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.440
I'm sorry.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.520
I'm so sorry, Adam.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.200
I promise you I only told you

16:01.840 --> 16:04.320
'cause I wanted to protect you
from all those lies.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.120
How did you know Corinne's secret?

16:10.680 --> 16:12.120
I was doing what I do.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.880
Digging dirt.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.000
And...

16:20.120 --> 16:21.360
I had no idea...

16:22.200 --> 16:23.880
that it would all lead back to my mother.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.200
Finding you...

16:28.440 --> 16:29.760
this family.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.120
<i>When we look into people,</i>

16:34.200 --> 16:35.720
<i>it always starts with the family.</i>

16:39.240 --> 16:41.280
<i>We gather as much information as we can.</i>

16:59.200 --> 17:00.600
<i>So when I saw your old address...</i>

17:02.160 --> 17:03.640
<i>something stood out to me.</i>

17:05.120 --> 17:07.640
<i>'Cause it's the exact same street</i>
<i>I grew up on.</i>

17:09.280 --> 17:11.720
<i>And then, when I was</i>
<i>looking through Corinne's photos...</i>

17:12.120 --> 17:13.080
<i>I saw a man.</i>

17:13.640 --> 17:14.640
<i>I recognized him</i>

17:14.720 --> 17:16.520
<i>from my mom's pictures.</i>

17:28.480 --> 17:29.760
<i>So I tracked him down.</i>

17:35.360 --> 17:37.000
<i>Everything fell into place.</i>

17:37.520 --> 17:38.760
<i>I ran a DNA test.</i>

17:39.240 --> 17:42.360
<i>I figured a way</i>
<i>to get a DNA sample from your father.</i>

17:43.360 --> 17:45.560
<i>It proved it all. And...</i>

17:46.800 --> 17:49.240
<i>I told him he had another child.</i>

17:49.320 --> 17:51.480
It's a baby. Could be anyone's.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.560
It's yours.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.360
Your father is my father.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.520
<i>We're family.</i>

18:23.720 --> 18:25.160
What I don't understand is...

18:26.560 --> 18:28.240
why were you looking into Corinne?

18:28.320 --> 18:30.800
Was it money? Were you blackmailing her?

18:30.880 --> 18:32.080
No. No.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.880
It was just another job.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.640
<i>I saw what Corinne had done.</i>

18:45.560 --> 18:47.840
<i>Your family was held together by a lie.</i>

18:47.920 --> 18:49.200
<i>You had to know.</i>

18:50.280 --> 18:52.080
You didn't have to stay with her,
you know?

18:53.240 --> 18:54.520
<i>I only told you.</i>

18:55.880 --> 18:57.920
<i>I didn't even tell the person</i>
<i>who hired me.</i>

18:58.960 --> 19:00.240
Who hired you?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.200
Someone at the football club.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.440
You know, where I approached you?

19:05.520 --> 19:06.600
Bob...

19:06.680 --> 19:07.880
Bob Baime?

19:19.720 --> 19:21.480
How can you only just have realized?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.440
<i>I'm telling you, Katz had a gun.</i>

19:25.000 --> 19:27.480
It must be there somewhere, so find it!

19:45.560 --> 19:46.400
Hey.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.600
-Bob.
-Hey. Weren't you--

19:49.680 --> 19:51.440
-Tell me where my wife is!
-What the hell?

19:51.520 --> 19:54.400
-Just tell me!
-What the hell? No! I have no idea!

19:54.480 --> 19:56.520
Gabrielle Dunbar agency...
You hired them, didn't you?

19:56.600 --> 19:57.560
-What?
-Didn't you?

19:57.640 --> 19:58.840
Adam, this is an assault!

19:58.920 --> 20:00.760
-Talk!
-There's witnesses!

20:02.720 --> 20:03.600
Get off me!

20:03.680 --> 20:05.160
Why would you hire an agency

20:05.240 --> 20:06.600
to dig dirt on my wife?

20:06.680 --> 20:08.240
Because she was trying to hurt me.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.000
-Meaning what?
-Meaning the stolen money!

20:10.080 --> 20:12.160
She stole the money
and was gonna pin the thing on me!

20:12.240 --> 20:13.280
-That is bullshit!
-Is it?!

20:13.360 --> 20:14.960
Yes. Why would she try to pin it on you?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.640
Because everyone thinks of me
as a desperate man with no work!

20:18.120 --> 20:19.480
Then there was an incident.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.360
Harrogate weekend.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.520
I claimed money
for things I shouldn't have.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.160
So Corinne came to you and said,
"I know you stole the money--"

20:27.240 --> 20:28.680
Corinne didn't come to me.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.320
You're a lawyer, use your brain.
You think she'd be that upfront?

20:32.400 --> 20:33.760
Tripp told me.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.320
-Tripp?
-Yeah.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.600
Tripp told me how she stole the money

20:37.680 --> 20:39.680
and was gonna use
the whole Harrogate debacle

20:39.760 --> 20:41.160
to hang the whole thing on me.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.200
When it comes to looking after ourselves
and our kids...

20:45.480 --> 20:46.560
...we're all corrupt.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.240
Said she had to be stopped!

20:59.680 --> 21:00.920
<i>So why did she call you?</i>

21:01.440 --> 21:03.160
You know why she called me.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.720
The stolen money thing?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.720
Yeah, the stolen money thing.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.000
The last time we spoke,
you looked me in the eye

21:09.080 --> 21:10.560
and told me she would never do that.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.600
She took the money.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.040
I lied to protect you.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.240
She called me, yes.
She asked for more time.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.520
-Did you give it to her?
-No.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.840
-Why?
-Because it needed dealing with!

21:54.000 --> 21:55.280
Hey, Adam.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.320
Jesus.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.320
What happened? You look awful.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.800
Why did Corinne call that morning?

22:00.880 --> 22:02.840
-What?
-Why did she call you?

22:03.480 --> 22:05.640
The stolen money thing,
I told you already.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.680
Just... come inside, have a drink.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.440
Is that blood on your shirt?

22:28.320 --> 22:29.240
I know, Tripp.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.400
Know what?

22:33.280 --> 22:34.400
I know you stole the money.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.720
Have you had a bang on the head?

22:39.600 --> 22:41.600
You asked Corinne for more time.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.000
Not the other way around.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.680
And then you used that time to set her up.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.280
You altered the books, you hid the money,

22:49.360 --> 22:51.840
and then you turned everyone against her.

22:51.920 --> 22:55.120
Oh, wow. You have got
some imagination, Adam.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.400
-Bob told me.
-Bob's a fuckin' liar.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.800
See, I keep thinking about...

23:00.640 --> 23:03.480
Corinne's reaction when I confronted her
about faking her pregnancy.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.800
She didn't bother to deny it.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.640
What she really wanted to know
was how I found out.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.400
She must've figured it was you

23:12.040 --> 23:14.480
sending her a warning
because she knew what you'd done.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.360
Get out of my house.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.120
Living the dream, right?

23:24.720 --> 23:26.000
Isn't that what you always say?

23:27.080 --> 23:29.840
How lucky we all are,
how thankful we should be?

23:29.920 --> 23:31.920
-I said--
-What would've happened to all this...

23:32.760 --> 23:34.840
this precious dream....

23:35.400 --> 23:37.080
if it got out that you were a thief?

23:37.160 --> 23:40.240
Nothing but a dirty, little, pathetic
thief stealing from the community.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.720
-It's fiction.
-You'd be destroyed!

23:41.800 --> 23:42.680
Get out!

23:44.240 --> 23:45.520
You remember this?

23:46.640 --> 23:49.360
Corinne's text about needing
more time apart. Read it!

23:50.600 --> 23:52.040
"You take care of the kids."

23:54.680 --> 23:55.560
You see...

23:56.760 --> 23:58.600
it's always bugged me because...

23:59.280 --> 24:01.280
Corinne never called them "the kids."

24:01.360 --> 24:03.760
It's always "the boys,"
because that's what they are.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.160
They're her boys.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.760
Corinne didn't write that text,
did she? You did.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.200
You wrote the text, and then what?

24:10.280 --> 24:12.600
You hid her phone?
Was it you that left it on the bridge?

24:12.680 --> 24:16.520
You think I'm capable
of doing all this, eh?

24:16.600 --> 24:19.240
You really think
that I'd do something to Corinne?

24:20.400 --> 24:21.800
Adam, we're mates.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.200
Okay.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.280
Well, I'm gonna go to the police

24:27.360 --> 24:29.720
and I'm gonna tell them everything
that I know.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.480
What, that's your proof?

24:32.040 --> 24:35.280
A text? Some half-assed theory.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.040
They're gonna laugh at you. Adam--

24:37.400 --> 24:39.320
Jesus! What the fuck?

24:39.400 --> 24:40.280
Why've you got a gun?

24:45.680 --> 24:46.600
Be careful.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.840
No more lies, Tripp.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.320
Please, Adam,
Becca's back in a minute. You can't...

24:54.400 --> 24:55.920
Okay, so start talking.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.280
There's some truth
in what you're saying, okay?

24:59.360 --> 25:00.720
-Some.
-Talk.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.840
Please, just put it away.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.880
Just talk to me!

25:04.960 --> 25:06.200
But not here, okay?

25:06.920 --> 25:07.840
I'll take you...

25:11.560 --> 25:13.120
I'll take you to her. Okay?

25:13.640 --> 25:15.080
I'll take you to Corinne.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.240
Where is she?

25:18.360 --> 25:19.840
Tripp, where's my wife?

25:21.360 --> 25:22.680
Where's my fucking wife?

25:22.760 --> 25:24.320
I'll take you to her. Please, I'll...

25:24.760 --> 25:25.840
Adam, I'll take you.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.760
-Is this some kind of a trick?
-No, it's not, I swear.

25:31.080 --> 25:31.960
She's...

25:34.040 --> 25:35.080
It's complicated.

25:36.760 --> 25:40.600
Come with me and you can do
whatever you want, okay?

25:41.560 --> 25:42.520
Just please...

25:44.880 --> 25:45.840
put the gun away.

25:48.080 --> 25:48.920
Jo!

25:49.440 --> 25:52.040
Adam Price has just attacked Bob Baime
at the sports club.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.280
-What?
-I know.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.080
He was here, what, half an hour ago?

25:56.160 --> 25:57.640
Well, where is he now?

26:25.080 --> 26:26.040
Where are we going?

26:27.160 --> 26:28.240
Master reservoir.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.040
Near Hollingworth?

26:31.160 --> 26:32.840
Corinne's dad
used to have a cottage there.

26:32.920 --> 26:33.800
Yeah, I know.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.120
Becca went with her one time
when the kids were little.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.600
Why there?

26:40.200 --> 26:41.200
It's where she is.

26:41.280 --> 26:42.440
I don't understand.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.080
Well, okay, I just...

26:44.680 --> 26:46.840
Let's get over there
and then when we're with Corinne,

26:46.920 --> 26:48.000
I'll explain properly.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.040
I'd die for them, Adam.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.280
My family.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.360
You did the right thing.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.360
She's gonna get help now.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.960
Would this be a bad time to admit
that I've always fancied Olivia's mom?

27:10.040 --> 27:11.960
No, Mike, perfect time.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.440
Thomas?

27:20.320 --> 27:21.480
Hi, Thomas.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.200
I'm DS Johanna Griffin.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.160
We met at the hospital with Dante.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.080
Yeah.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.080
Thomas, have you got any idea
where your dad is?

27:28.880 --> 27:30.120
No. Why?

27:30.200 --> 27:32.560
Please don't worry.
I just need to locate him.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.320
-But he's not answering his phone.
-Right.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.280
Your dad told me about the tracker
your mom put on your phone.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.560
-Have you still got that installed?
-Yeah.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.680
-It could help me find him.
-Okay?

27:42.760 --> 27:45.120
What's this about? Is he in trouble?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.760
Right, let's get this over with.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.000
Where are we going?

28:35.360 --> 28:36.200
Just...

28:44.200 --> 28:45.160
Slow down.

28:47.640 --> 28:48.480
Okay.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.480
Why did you need the money?

28:59.360 --> 29:00.600
Everyone needs money.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.320
But we don't all steal it.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.360
I overstretched.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.040
Lived way beyond my...

29:13.400 --> 29:14.640
You know what this town's like.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.720
Everybody wants the best,
to be seen with the best.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.560
But it...

29:21.440 --> 29:22.560
sneaks up on you.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.040
Once you borrow from Peter to pay Paul,

29:25.120 --> 29:26.800
but Peter's a prick
and wants 70% interest,

29:26.880 --> 29:29.840
and Paul keeps threatening
to take away your cars,

29:30.240 --> 29:31.160
cancel your holidays,

29:31.240 --> 29:33.280
so you dodge left, dodge right...

29:33.360 --> 29:36.160
And before you know it,
you're up to your neck in it.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.360
So you stole from the club? How much?

29:40.800 --> 29:41.800
Thousands.

29:42.560 --> 29:45.520
Subs, donations, sponsorship.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.600
And we made that place
a roaring success over the years,

29:48.680 --> 29:50.440
me, Corinne, one or two others.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.240
And leave her to take a cut.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.680
This is the way the world works.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.880
Every single day we make decisions
for the good of our family.

29:57.960 --> 30:01.040
It's why we work,
it's why we do every single thing we do:

30:01.120 --> 30:02.800
to look after those that we love.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.760
I had every intention
of paying the money back.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.320
But Corinne, when she found out,
she was appalled.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.400
I begged her.

30:36.800 --> 30:37.720
I begged.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.360
Adam, I said to her,
"You expose this, and it's me, done.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.040
Job, life, reputation... over."

30:44.120 --> 30:47.160
Because these stories, they spread online.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.360
They come at you. I've seen it. And...

30:49.960 --> 30:51.200
she knew that and...

30:52.800 --> 30:55.840
so she gave me time
to sort it out, to put it right.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.480
But really, in truth...

30:58.040 --> 30:59.880
there was no way I could pay it back.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.480
So I fiddled the books,

31:02.560 --> 31:05.120
pointed the finger at Corinne,
dragged Bob in with me.

31:06.640 --> 31:07.480
So...

31:09.320 --> 31:10.280
Where is she?

31:15.440 --> 31:16.680
Where is she now?

31:19.920 --> 31:20.840
I'm sorry.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.640
Adam, I'm really sorry.

31:26.880 --> 31:27.760
Tripp...

31:29.880 --> 31:30.760
where is she?

31:35.320 --> 31:36.160
About here.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.080
Corinne.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.800
No.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.280
No!

33:00.480 --> 33:01.440
I didn't mean to.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.120
I asked her to meet me to talk about it.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.200
But she wouldn't let me in the house
because she was furious with me,

33:08.280 --> 33:11.400
'cause she thought it was me that hired
the stranger that told you her secret.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.800
So we spoke in the garage.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.640
-Corinne, please.
- No.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.680
No, I can't keep this
from people any longer.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.640
You went after my family, Tripp.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.920
-That crossed a line.
-I did not do that.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.800
-I did not hire anybody.
-You expect me to believe that?

33:24.880 --> 33:27.400
Please, I can sort this, I swear.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.240
Well, then sort it today.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.680
-I can't sort it today, I need time!
-No! No!

33:31.760 --> 33:32.800
Time's up.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.120
<i>She'd said her piece</i>
<i>and she was walking away.</i>

33:35.200 --> 33:38.480
And that's it. It was all gonna come out
and I couldn't let that happen.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.520
<i>So I grabbed the nearest thing to hand.</i>

33:41.440 --> 33:42.880
I hit her with it.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.880
I didn't want to but she wouldn't stop.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.600
<i>She wouldn't stop.</i>

33:58.000 --> 33:58.880
I've...

33:59.480 --> 34:00.840
I've had to live with that.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.320
To go on as if nothing had happened.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.000
But in here, it...

34:09.400 --> 34:11.960
It never goes away, that moment.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.160
Mrs. Price.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.120
What about the boys?

34:34.080 --> 34:35.560
She's their mother.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.360
She's their mother.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.760
I can't live with it.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.400
But I have to.

34:44.680 --> 34:45.640
We...

34:45.720 --> 34:48.120
We have to go on
as if nothing has happened.

34:48.680 --> 34:49.520
Okay?

34:50.200 --> 34:51.520
So that's what we'll do.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.640
Are you out of your mind?

34:54.520 --> 34:56.560
I'm sorry, I really am.

34:56.640 --> 34:58.040
But you'd have done the same thing.

34:58.960 --> 35:01.440
None of us know what we're capable of
until the time comes.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.240
But now...

35:14.040 --> 35:15.440
this is our secret.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.040
No, no.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.040
You're going to prison
for the rest of your life.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.240
Won't happen.

35:22.920 --> 35:23.880
Can't.

35:24.360 --> 35:27.440
Adam, the sports club books are a mess.
Nobody's ever gonna untangle them.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.160
You go to the police
and what will they know?

35:33.240 --> 35:35.000
Corinne faked her pregnancy.

35:35.080 --> 35:35.920
Fact.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.840
You two had a fight. Fact.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.000
The next day she was killed
in your garage. Fact.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.400
Oh, I cleaned up the blood
but there'll still be traces.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.400
And the logical conclusion...

35:47.840 --> 35:49.080
you killed her.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.840
You buried her.
You parked her car near the airport.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.680
Hid her phone
to make it look like suicide.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.040
The simplest explanation
is always the one they want.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.440
Husband, motive.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.480
Me?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.960
What's done is done, mate. Let's...

36:19.400 --> 36:20.880
Let's not make a bad situation worse.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.160
Adam?

36:27.440 --> 36:28.600
You have no choice.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.000
Either you accept this and move on

36:31.080 --> 36:34.240
or you go down and your boys
are left without a mom or--

37:24.760 --> 37:25.960
Go on, Ryan!

37:32.320 --> 37:33.520
Oh, ref!

37:33.600 --> 37:34.640
Specsavers!

37:35.080 --> 37:36.680
Blow the whistle!
That's what it's for!

37:40.360 --> 37:41.520
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.880
He's playing well.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.040
-That should've been a penalty though.
-Well, tell the ref.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.280
So this is how you're spending
your retirement, is it?

37:53.360 --> 37:54.480
Kid's football.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.120
I just wanted to see how you're all doing.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.120
We're okay.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.360
-I'll see you later.
-Hey, Daisy.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.360
It's hard on the boys but...

38:09.280 --> 38:10.160
they're strong.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.120
Stronger than me.

38:17.960 --> 38:18.880
How are you doing?

38:20.400 --> 38:22.160
Good. I'm trying to make a go of it.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.920
It's not perfect but...

38:28.240 --> 38:30.600
It's Katz's sentencing tomorrow.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.160
He'll get life.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.640
I hope so.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.840
Never know though, do you?

38:36.920 --> 38:38.360
Still makes me nervous.

38:38.520 --> 38:41.040
My whole career,
I've hated sentencing day.

38:42.640 --> 38:44.600
Any word on Chrissy Killane?

38:45.560 --> 38:46.440
Your sister?

38:48.280 --> 38:49.800
Still missing after she absconded.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.080
I doubt they're pursuing her very hard

38:52.160 --> 38:54.760
as she blackmailed people
who won't press charges

38:54.840 --> 38:56.640
'cause they don't want
their secrets revealed.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.320
They'll keep going 'round and 'round.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.640
I should have let Corinne
keep her secret.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.040
This might never have happened.

39:05.120 --> 39:07.160
So did Chrissy kill her?

39:09.080 --> 39:12.600
Or did I, by making her feel so insecure
that she faked her pregnancy?

39:13.400 --> 39:15.080
There's only one person to blame.

39:16.960 --> 39:17.800
And he's dead.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.640
Can I ask you something?

39:25.920 --> 39:27.000
Of course.

39:27.440 --> 39:28.800
Do you sleep okay?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.160
No, not really.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.440
Sorry.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.600
You need to give that to me.

39:51.800 --> 39:52.800
Adam?

39:52.880 --> 39:55.120
Adam, we've gotta act fast.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.240
I'd sleep a whole lot worse if you spent
the rest of your life in prison.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.760
I made a choice, Adam.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.520
And I can live with that.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.520
Katz is going down anyway.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.440
It's not like we're framing
an innocent man.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.680
I just wish that...

40:24.720 --> 40:27.240
people knew who really killed Corinne.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.640
Well, that can't happen.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.720
Katz can deny all he wants, but...

40:33.160 --> 40:35.640
his gun links all the deaths together.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.360
Look, Adam...

40:41.360 --> 40:42.880
your boys lost their mom.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.040
If the truth comes out...

40:45.720 --> 40:47.040
they'll lose you as well.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.040
Yeah.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.480
Funny though.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.760
The stranger wanted to...

41:00.400 --> 41:01.960
rid the world of secrets.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.640
Here we are,
keeping the biggest one of all.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.240
Yeah!
