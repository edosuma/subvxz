WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:04.171
So, what, you're
telling me never?

00:04.205 --> 00:06.174
Faith, really,
now is not the time.

00:06.206 --> 00:08.409
I'm curious. Never ever?

00:12.179 --> 00:13.580
Come on, really.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.048
All this time,
and not even once?

00:16.617 --> 00:18.818
How many times
do I have to say it?

00:18.852 --> 00:21.689
I have never...
done it...

00:21.722 --> 00:23.856
with Xander.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.225
He's just a friend.

00:28.728 --> 00:31.332
So? What are friends for?

00:31.364 --> 00:33.100
I mean, I'm sorry, it's just,

00:33.134 --> 00:35.034
all this sweating nightly,
side-by-side action,

00:35.069 --> 00:37.070
and you never put in
for a little after-hours...

00:37.104 --> 00:38.706
(grunts)

00:38.738 --> 00:39.939
Thanks for the poetry.

00:39.972 --> 00:42.009
And, no. I love Xander.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.246
I just don't...
 love Xander.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.014
Besides, I think it ruins
friendships to do that stuff.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.781
You think too much.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.918
Hey... there's one more.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.786
How do you know?

00:53.820 --> 00:55.088
I think too much.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.695
Okay. Count of three.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.164
One...

01:05.932 --> 01:06.500
Three.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.112
(growling)
(grunting)

01:32.159 --> 01:33.960
Nicely diverted, B.

01:33.993 --> 01:35.929
Diverted? That was me
fighting for my life,

01:35.962 --> 01:37.798
Miss Attention Span.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.334
This isn't a Tupperware party.
It's a little hard to plan.

01:40.367 --> 01:43.436
The count of three isn't
a plan. It's Sesame Street.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.004
Hey, they're toast
and we're here,

01:45.037 --> 01:46.973
so it couldn't have
been too bad, right?

01:47.007 --> 01:48.942
Who were those guys, anyways?

01:48.975 --> 01:51.944
I don't know.
They didn't seem local.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.646
Look, why don't
we grab the weapons.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.448
Maybe Giles...

01:57.450 --> 01:59.686
MR. TRICK:
Check these out.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.689
(giggling)

02:02.722 --> 02:05.259
I... I just love
 The Family Circus.

02:05.293 --> 02:08.695
That P.J., he's getting
to be quite a handful.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.098
Well...

02:12.132 --> 02:14.801
I haven't seen
anything like this in, uh,

02:14.835 --> 02:16.937
well, a good long while.

02:16.969 --> 02:20.441
Where is the owner
of these fine implements?

02:20.473 --> 02:22.175
The common term is "slain."

02:22.210 --> 02:24.277
But I've been seeing
this breed around.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.513
Are we expecting any trouble?

02:25.545 --> 02:27.681
Do you like Family Circus?

02:27.715 --> 02:29.483
I like Marmaduke.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.984
Oh. Eww.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.287
He's always on the furniture.
Unsanitary.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.524
Nobody can tell Marmaduke what
to do. That's my kind of dog.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.158
I like to read Cathy.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.365
So, uh, what about these swords?

02:44.397 --> 02:46.734
What-what should we
do about that?

02:46.766 --> 02:48.336
Well, let's just
keep an eye out.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.137
We've got the dedication
coming up in a few days.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.473
We certainly can't have anything
interfering with that.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.375
Well, maybe

02:54.408 --> 02:57.211
we should postpone the...

02:57.245 --> 02:59.347
the-the dedication.

02:59.379 --> 03:03.015
I believe the honorable mayor
hates that idea.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.389
The dedication...

03:08.421 --> 03:12.225
is the final step
before my ascension.

03:12.259 --> 03:16.195
I have waited longer
than you can imagine for this.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.031
After the hundred days,

03:18.064 --> 03:20.700
I'll be on a higher plane.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.237
And I'll have
no more need for...

03:24.271 --> 03:28.108
Well, let's just say
I won't be concerned...

03:28.140 --> 03:29.742
with the little things.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.881
Mr. Trick,
watch these people.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.449
Anything you
find out about them--

03:36.484 --> 03:39.086
well, let's just see that that
information reaches the slayers.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.354
Who knows? With any luck,
they'll kill each other.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.524
Then everyone's a winner.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.093
Everyone, of course...

03:46.126 --> 03:47.295
meaning me.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.968
(wolf howling)

03:55.002 --> 03:56.770
*

04:46.487 --> 04:49.456
XANDER: Willow, what are these?
WILLOW: They're early
 admission packets.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.091
Harvard...

04:51.124 --> 04:53.093
Yale...

04:53.125 --> 04:55.262
Wesleyan...

04:55.295 --> 04:59.199
some German Polytechnical
Institute whose name I, uh,

04:59.231 --> 05:00.934
I can't pronounce.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.470
Is anyone else
intimidated?

05:02.502 --> 05:04.004
Because I'm just expecting
thin slips of paper

05:04.036 --> 05:06.874
with the words "no way"
written in crayon.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.610
They're typing those now.
Oh.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.278
I'm so overwhelmed.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.947
I-I got in.
To actual colleges.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.016
A-And they're wooing me.

05:16.048 --> 05:17.016
They're pitching woo.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.119
The wooing stage
is always fun.

05:19.151 --> 05:20.887
Ahh. But it's weird.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.055
Rejection I can handle

05:23.089 --> 05:26.026
'cause of the years
of training, but this...

05:26.059 --> 05:27.894
I fell your pain,
Will. Like right now,

05:27.927 --> 05:29.196
I'm torn between
the fast-growing fields

05:29.228 --> 05:31.564
of appliance repair
and motel management.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.466
Of course, I'm still
waiting to hear back

05:33.500 --> 05:35.836
from the Corndog Emporium, so...

05:37.103 --> 05:38.237
Well, I think it's great.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.540
Early admission.

05:39.572 --> 05:41.040
Now there's nothing
standing between you

05:41.074 --> 05:42.209
and a brilliant future.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.343
Well, if I may suggest,
graduate.

05:44.377 --> 05:48.048
Getting left back-- not
the thrill ride you'd expect.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.183
That's so cute.
Planning life as a loser?

05:51.218 --> 05:53.387
Most people just
turn out that way,

05:53.420 --> 05:55.555
but you're really
taking charge.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.425
The comedy stylings of
Miss Cordelia Chase, everyone.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.160
Who, incidentally, won't be
needing a higher education

06:00.192 --> 06:03.697
when she markets her own very
successful line of hooker wear.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.999
Well, Xander,
I could dress more like you,

06:06.033 --> 06:09.369
but... Oh, my father has a job.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.740
I'm not gonna waste
the perfect comeback on you now.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.175
But don't think I don't have it.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.877
Oh, yes, its time will come.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.947
So, life beyond high school.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.516
Anyone, please...

06:22.550 --> 06:24.117
chime in.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.786
I hear it's nice.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.588
And a place I'll never go
if I don't pass

06:27.620 --> 06:29.589
Mrs. Taggart's
chemistry test tomorrow.

06:29.622 --> 06:31.725
Oh, I can help.
Chemistry's easy.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.226
It's a lot like witchcraft,
only less newt.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.862
So what do you say--
study jam,

06:35.896 --> 06:37.197
my house, tonight?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.199
I'm there.
(school bell rings)

06:39.231 --> 06:41.634
Oh. I have to go see Giles,

06:41.668 --> 06:44.538
report on last night's patrol.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.807
Oh, yeah. He said he wanted
to talk to you.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.908
What about? Is he okay?

06:48.942 --> 06:51.244
He's looked better.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.213
Of course, training procedures
have been updated

06:53.245 --> 06:54.481
quite a bit
since your day.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.917
Much greater emphasis
on field work.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.250
Really?

06:58.284 --> 06:59.620
Oh, yes.

06:59.653 --> 07:03.423
Not all books
and theory nowadays.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.959
I have, in fact, faced
two vampires myself.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.428
Under controlled
circumstances, of course.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.598
No danger of finding those here.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.000
Vampires?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.701
Controlled circumstances.
Hello, Buffy.

07:17.004 --> 07:20.139
Well...

07:20.173 --> 07:21.975
hello.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.478
New watcher?

07:24.512 --> 07:26.278
New watcher.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.348
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.685
It's very nice to meet you.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.324
Is he evil?

07:37.356 --> 07:38.658
Evil?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.593
The last one was evil.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.764
Oh, yes. Gwendolyn Post.
We all heard.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.365
No. Mr. Giles has
checked my credentials

07:46.399 --> 07:48.367
rather thoroughly and
phoned the Council,

07:48.401 --> 07:51.338
but I'm glad to see
you're on the ball as well.

07:51.370 --> 07:54.542
A good slayer is a
cautious slayer.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.512
Is he evil?

07:58.545 --> 08:00.146
Not in the strictest sense.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.682
Well, I'm glad
that's cleared up.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.216
As I'm sure
none of us is anxious

08:03.250 --> 08:06.286
to waste any time
on pleasantries,

08:06.319 --> 08:08.221
why don't you
tell me everything

08:08.254 --> 08:10.524
about last night's patrol.

08:10.557 --> 08:11.891
Vampires.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.627
Yes?

08:13.661 --> 08:14.995
Killed 'em.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.531
Anything else you can tell me?

08:19.499 --> 08:22.802
Uh... one of them had swords.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.805
I-I don't think he was
with the other two.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.105
Swords?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.675
Swords...

08:32.345 --> 08:33.980
One long, one short?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.649
Mmm. Both pointy.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.350
With, like, jewels and things.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.586
Sounds familiar.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.885
It should.

08:43.255 --> 08:45.091
El Eliminati.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.693
15th...

08:46.726 --> 08:48.528
15th-century duelist cult,
deadly in their day.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.496
Their numbers dwindled
in later centuries

08:50.529 --> 08:52.700
due to an increase
in anti-vampire activity

08:52.732 --> 08:55.869
and a lot of
pointless dueling.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.269
They eventually became
the acolytes

08:57.303 --> 08:58.538
of a demon
called Balthazar,

08:58.572 --> 09:00.874
who brought them
to the New World,

09:00.908 --> 09:02.775
specifically here.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.376
You seem to know
a lot about them.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.714
I didn't get this job
because of my looks.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.416
I really, really
believe that.

09:09.448 --> 09:13.186
I've researched this town's
history extensively.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.688
So why have we not
seen them before this?

09:15.722 --> 09:18.557
They were driven out
a hundred years ago.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.427
Happily, Balthazar was killed.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.596
I don't know by whom.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.431
And they're back 'cause...

09:24.463 --> 09:27.366
Balthazar had an amulet
purported to give him strength.

09:27.399 --> 09:29.068
When he was killed, it was taken

09:29.101 --> 09:32.239
by a wealthy landowner named...

09:32.272 --> 09:33.472
I don't want to bore you
with the details.

09:33.505 --> 09:34.607
Little bit late.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.809
Named Gleaves.
It was buried with him,

09:36.844 --> 09:39.379
and I believe the few
remaining Eliminati

09:39.412 --> 09:42.615
are probably looking for it.
For sentimental value.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.284
And you don't think that
this amulet poses any threat?

09:45.317 --> 09:46.720
Oh, no, not at all.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.456
Nonetheless, we may as well
keep it from them.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.625
Buffy, you will go to
the Gleaves family crypt tonight

09:51.658 --> 09:53.259
and fetch the amulet.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.594
I will?

09:54.628 --> 09:57.965
Are you not used
to being given orders?

09:57.998 --> 10:02.302
Whenever Giles sends me on a
mission, he always says please.

10:02.335 --> 10:05.773
And afterwards I get a cookie.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.808
I don't feel we're getting off
on quite the right foot.

10:09.842 --> 10:13.513
Ah. This is, perhaps, Faith.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.448
New watcher?

10:16.482 --> 10:17.583
New watcher.
New watcher.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.653
Screw that.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.322
Now, why didn't
I just say that?

10:23.355 --> 10:25.357
Uh, Buffy,
would you...

10:25.392 --> 10:28.195
I'll see if I can
get her back.

10:28.227 --> 10:31.630
Don't say anything incredibly
interesting while I'm gone.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.538
They'll get used to me.

10:44.878 --> 10:48.447
Faith, wait. Look, I know
this new guy's a dork, but...

10:48.480 --> 10:50.116
Well, I have nothing
to follow that.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.684
He's pretty much
just a dork.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.354
You're actually gonna
take orders from him?

10:54.386 --> 10:56.056
That's the job.
What else can we do?

10:56.088 --> 10:57.790
Whatever we want.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.726
We're slayers, girlfriend,
the chosen two.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.695
Why should we let him take
all the fun out of it?

11:01.729 --> 11:03.230
Oh, that'd be tragic--

11:03.263 --> 11:05.732
taking the fun out of slaying,
stabbing, beheading.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.667
Oh, like you
don't dig it.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.235
I don't.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.071
You're a liar.
I've seen you.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.572
Tell me staking a vamp doesn't
get you a little bit juiced.

11:13.605 --> 11:15.542
Come on, say it.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.644
(laughs)
You can't fool me.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.212
The look in your eyes
right after a kill.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.881
You just get hungry for more.

11:21.914 --> 11:24.350
You're way off base.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.186
Tell me that if you don't
get in a good slaying,

11:26.219 --> 11:29.688
after a while, you just start
itching for some vamp to show up

11:29.722 --> 11:31.658
so you can give him
a good... (grunts)

11:31.691 --> 11:33.493
Again with the grunting.

11:33.525 --> 11:35.427
You realize I'm not
comfortable with this.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.397
Hey, slaying's what
we were built for.

11:37.429 --> 11:40.033
If you're not enjoying it,
you're doing something wrong.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.168
What about the assignment?

11:42.201 --> 11:45.705
Tell you what-- you do the
homework, and I'll copy yours.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.720
*

12:24.244 --> 12:26.645
Strike one.
No amulet there.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.688
Game over.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.625
(indistinct voices in distance)

12:59.379 --> 13:01.380
*

13:14.660 --> 13:16.663
(door closes)

13:23.470 --> 13:26.139
(gasps) Faith.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.774
What are you doing,
hiding in there?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.942
Looking for the amulet.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.445
Wasn't counting on the special
guest stars-- six against one.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.014
Hence the hiding.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.850
Yeah. Well, it's six
against two now, so come on.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.959
Wait, stop, think.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.793
No, no, no.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.662
It's a manhole--

13:49.696 --> 13:51.398
tight space, no escape,
six against two--

13:51.431 --> 13:52.899
not unlike
three against one.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.734
And there might be more,
so come on.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.136
You're just gonna go down
there-- that's your plan?

13:57.169 --> 13:59.206
Who said I had a plan? I don't
know how many's down there,

13:59.239 --> 14:01.008
but I want to find out.
And I'll know

14:01.041 --> 14:04.376
when I land, and if you don't
come in after me, I might die.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.662
These are all the diaries,
then, yours included.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.898
That's everything.
Knock yourself out.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.432
Please?

14:29.568 --> 14:31.904
Oh, yes. Here's
your first entry.

14:31.938 --> 14:35.741
"Slayer is willful
and insolent."

14:35.774 --> 14:37.777
That would be our girl,
wouldn't it?

14:37.809 --> 14:40.346
Well, you have
to get to know her.
Hmm.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.448
"Her abuse of
the English language

14:42.481 --> 14:44.918
is such that I understand
only every other sentence."

14:44.951 --> 14:47.921
Oh, this is going to make
fascinating reading.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.655
She should be back by now.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.025
Not to fret.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.895
My mission scenario has
her back in one minute.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.066
Shouldn't be any trouble.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.467
(growling)
(grunting)

15:01.500 --> 15:02.970
We're surrounded.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.504
You noticed that, too?

15:34.366 --> 15:35.934
Let me... (grunts)

15:37.336 --> 15:38.605
Aah!

15:40.873 --> 15:42.209
(growling)

15:46.046 --> 15:48.615
Let's settle this honorably.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.023
Well, then, let's
just settle it.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.130
Buffy! You son of a bitch.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.309
*

16:20.712 --> 16:22.548
I hate it
when they drown me.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.991
B., got to go.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.662
We came for the amulet.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.900
Tell me you don't
get off on this.

16:41.933 --> 16:44.903
Didn't suck.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.707
Well...

16:48.740 --> 16:51.911
looks authentic enough.

16:51.943 --> 16:54.246
Of course, there are
tests to be made

16:54.280 --> 16:55.914
before actual verification.

16:55.947 --> 16:58.184
How about verifying
that your nearly extinct cult

16:58.217 --> 17:00.187
was out in magnum force
last night?

17:00.220 --> 17:03.322
Faith and I got into
a serious party situation.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.258
You all right?
I had to lather, rinse,

17:05.290 --> 17:07.227
and repeat about five million
times to get the sewer

17:07.259 --> 17:10.329
out of my hair,
but otherwise, I'm of the good.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.832
Thank you for asking.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.534
Perhaps there were a few
more than we'd anticipated,

17:14.567 --> 17:16.568
but I'd expect you'd
be ready for anything.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.770
Remember the three key
words for any slayer:

17:18.805 --> 17:19.838
Preparation...

17:19.872 --> 17:21.007
Preparation...

17:21.039 --> 17:23.576
Preparation.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.545
That's one word three times.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.715
(school bell rings)
I have a chem test.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.184
So sad that I'm actually
happy about that.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.453
Giles, we need to talk.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.623
Buffy...

17:36.655 --> 17:39.858
I must ask you to remember
that I am your watcher.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.060
From now on, anything you
have to say about slaying

17:42.095 --> 17:44.530
you will say to me.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.465
The only thing you need
discuss with Mr. Giles

17:46.499 --> 17:49.402
is overdue book fees.

17:49.435 --> 17:50.470
Understood?

17:51.938 --> 17:53.205
We'll talk.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.942
Of course.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.545
You're not helping.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.078
I know.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.115
I feel just sick about it.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.886
BUFFY:
It was intense.
It was like I just

18:07.920 --> 18:10.789
let go and became
this force.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.159
I just didn't care anymore.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.560
Yeah, I know
what that's like.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.728
I don't think you can.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.064
It's kind of
a slayer thing.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.898
I-I don't even think
I'm explaining it well.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.601
You're explaining it
a lot, though.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.336
All right. You
have one period

18:23.369 --> 18:25.003
to fill out your
test booklets.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.638
Periodic charts
are located on the back.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.174
You're on the honor system.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.176
So remember, no talking.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.246
You see, the thing was,
Faith knew

18:33.279 --> 18:34.614
that I didn't even
want to go down there.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.648
(clears throat)

18:36.682 --> 18:38.351
Ms. Summers?

18:40.319 --> 18:42.189
You have one hour.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.159
Okay, so the best part...

18:46.192 --> 18:49.862
Buffy. Test?
You know. Remember?

18:49.895 --> 18:52.464
The thing you didn't
come over to study for?

18:52.499 --> 18:54.901
Right. Got it.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.939
Sorry. Okay, so we're down
there, in the sewers,

18:59.971 --> 19:01.607
and Faith's got three of them
on her at once...

19:01.641 --> 19:04.544
Hey. Whoa. Can we resume
Buffy's ode to Faith later,

19:04.576 --> 19:06.413
like when I'm not actively
multiple-choicing?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.082
How come your eye twitches
every time I say Faith's name?

19:11.683 --> 19:13.118
What?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.386
No, it doesn't.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.655
Faith.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.291
Cut it out.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.660
We got a test to take, okay?

19:20.692 --> 19:22.127
And I'm highly caffeinated,

19:22.161 --> 19:23.796
and I'm trying
to concentrate.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.164
Some of us actually
care about school, you know.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.511
Hey, girlfriend. Bad time?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.525
No, sh-she can't.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.797
Y-you can't. Can you?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.203
What's up?
Vampires.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.173
Uh, Faith, unless
there's a total eclipse

20:07.205 --> 20:08.775
in the next five minutes,
it's daylight.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.176
Good for us, bad for
them. Found a nest.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.811
Has potential.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.819
Aah!
(growling)

20:22.221 --> 20:24.056
Rise and shine,
people.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.726
It's your wake-up call.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.760
*

21:10.769 --> 21:13.673
Hey. You're not
leaving, are you?

21:13.705 --> 21:15.307
I saw you making friends.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.675
Them?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.347
Boys. I like you.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.817
What's the matter?

21:25.852 --> 21:28.587
You're not afraid of
little me, are you?

21:28.621 --> 21:30.522
We better sit down. Come on.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.792
I can sense this is
a business trip.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.296
What's the what?

21:37.329 --> 21:38.998
Balthazar.

21:39.030 --> 21:39.999
Dead demon.

21:40.031 --> 21:42.868
Not as dead as you think.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.604
(clears throat)

21:44.636 --> 21:47.339
Word on the street puts him
in the packing warehouse

21:47.374 --> 21:49.275
on Devereau.
He's looking for...

21:49.307 --> 21:51.478
His amulet. It's supposed
to restore his strength.

21:51.510 --> 21:52.811
From what I'm hearing,
that's not something

21:52.845 --> 21:53.980
we'd like to see happen.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.948
No problem-- we got the amulet.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.549
I know. I spoke to Giles,
but he said

21:57.584 --> 21:59.385
you gave it
to someone.
Ah. There you are.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.788
Ah, speak of the really
annoying person.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.391
You're certainly giving me
a run for my money.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.461
I think we ought to establish
that if you're going to

22:09.496 --> 22:12.699
go out slaying, you leave me a
number where I can contact you.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.333
Where's the amulet?

22:15.334 --> 22:16.803
Who are you?

22:16.836 --> 22:18.671
A friend. Do you have it?

22:18.704 --> 22:20.906
It's somewhere safe.

22:23.542 --> 22:24.743
How did you know?

22:24.777 --> 22:26.178
Pooches your jacket.

22:26.211 --> 22:28.013
Now, hang on a minute...

22:28.047 --> 22:30.249
Walking around with this thing
is like wearing a target.

22:30.281 --> 22:32.751
You're gonna put it somewhere
safe that's actually safe?

22:32.785 --> 22:34.353
Yeah. I'll do it now.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.221
I'll do some recon
on Balthazar.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.390
If I may...

22:37.423 --> 22:38.891
Balthazar is dead.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.593
Am I the only one
that remembers that?

22:40.626 --> 22:42.429
Be careful.

22:42.461 --> 22:43.730
You know me.

22:43.762 --> 22:46.598
I mean it.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.236
What's going on?

22:54.140 --> 22:55.541
Call me.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.614
Let me tell you what I see.

23:01.647 --> 23:05.585
I see fear...

23:05.617 --> 23:09.188
and remorse...

23:09.221 --> 23:12.424
and the pitiful look of faces

23:12.459 --> 23:15.561
that cry out for mercy.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.797
But what I don't see

23:17.829 --> 23:20.031
is what I want to see,

23:20.066 --> 23:22.067
and that's

23:22.101 --> 23:25.037
my amulet!

23:25.070 --> 23:26.137
Lord Balthazar,

23:26.172 --> 23:27.906
we found it. We had it.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.941
But the slayers...

23:28.974 --> 23:31.009
Already I'm bored.

23:33.779 --> 23:34.780
(cracking)

23:36.281 --> 23:37.584
(crack)

23:40.752 --> 23:42.153
Vincent...

23:42.188 --> 23:45.692
come here.

23:48.326 --> 23:50.328
Closer.

23:51.864 --> 23:54.133
Closer.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.338
Let me tell you...

24:00.372 --> 24:03.142
what I want to see.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.487
BUFFY:
Okay, we got ten,
maybe 12 bad guys

24:14.520 --> 24:17.624
and one big demon in desperate
need of a StairMaster.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.026
I say we take 'em all,

24:20.058 --> 24:22.094
hard and fast, now.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.096
We need a little more
firepower than none.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.765
We should head back
to the library.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.767
Well, I guess Jacuzzi boy
isn't going anywhere.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.603
I just wish we had...

24:30.636 --> 24:32.038
Ah.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.240
That is too good.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.415
Oh, score.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.190
Think they're insured?

24:51.222 --> 24:53.660
Strangely, not my priority.

24:53.692 --> 24:56.061
When are you gonna get this, B?

24:56.095 --> 24:57.697
Life of a slayer's very simple--

24:57.730 --> 24:59.330
want.

25:00.732 --> 25:03.234
Take. Have.

25:06.838 --> 25:09.174
Want.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.210
Take.

25:11.242 --> 25:13.244
Have.

25:16.347 --> 25:18.183
I'm getting it.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.359
(gunshot)

25:30.461 --> 25:32.498
Drop the weapons
and get down on the ground.

25:32.530 --> 25:33.766
Now!

25:40.372 --> 25:43.710
I said drop the weapons,
or I fire.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.378
(knife clatters)

25:53.251 --> 25:54.420
Now spread 'em.

25:54.452 --> 25:56.087
You wish.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.660
Hands in the air where
I can see 'em-- slow.

26:05.396 --> 26:07.967
Good. Now cuff 'em.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.605
I like him.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.673
He's butch.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.612
That's some artillery
you two were puttin' together.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.780
You with one of
them girl gangs?

26:22.949 --> 26:25.217
Yeah. We're the slayers.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.019
(laughs)

26:28.921 --> 26:30.923
You want to get out here?

26:38.096 --> 26:40.598
Can't save the world in jail.

26:44.770 --> 26:48.273
One, two...

26:48.307 --> 26:49.441
(grunting)
(tires screech)

26:59.719 --> 27:01.119
Got it.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.354
Ow.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.656
We should
call an ambulance.

27:04.691 --> 27:05.958
Five people already have,
the racket we made,

27:05.991 --> 27:07.660
and they're fine.

27:10.561 --> 27:12.431
Come on, let's get
out of here.

27:12.463 --> 27:13.799
Come on!

27:13.833 --> 27:14.834
(groaning)

27:33.419 --> 27:35.020
Admit it.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.455
Some days don't you want
to just wake up and say

27:37.489 --> 27:39.357
to hell with the diet?

27:39.391 --> 27:41.160
Want to make waffles?

27:41.192 --> 27:42.961
Big Saturday brunch?

27:42.994 --> 27:46.498
No, thanks. I'm not
really that hungry.

27:46.531 --> 27:48.034
(sighs)

27:48.067 --> 27:50.135
So what'd you and Faith
do last night?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.703
Nothing.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.840
Uh... nothing really important.

27:57.375 --> 28:00.412
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
meddle in your slaying.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.248
Just as long as you're careful.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.282
I am.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.887
You sure about those waffles?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.724
Yeah.

28:12.759 --> 28:15.426
But if you want them,
I can help you make them.

28:15.461 --> 28:18.029
No. They only
don't have calories

28:18.064 --> 28:20.031
if I make 'em for you.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.599
Mom logic.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.736
You, uh, done with the paper?

28:23.769 --> 28:25.336
Yeah.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.539
Let's see what's
happening in Sunnydale.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.744
There we go.
Thanks a lot, fellas.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.413
Thanks a heap.

28:34.445 --> 28:36.915
Hey, have fun on
that camping trip, now.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.616
Don't forget to roast
a wiener for me.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.451
Yes, yes.
(chuckling)

28:42.253 --> 28:43.756
There we go.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.791
All right,
you can come out now.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.762
Backbone of America,
those little guys.

28:50.797 --> 28:53.699
Seeing the hope and courage
on their bright little faces,

28:53.731 --> 28:56.367
I swear I could just...
I could just eat 'em up.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.635
(chuckles)

28:57.669 --> 29:00.239
So, any news
about the Eliminati?

29:00.271 --> 29:02.942
(growling)

29:02.974 --> 29:05.743
In the name of
Lord Balthazar, die!

29:07.946 --> 29:10.582
(coughing)

29:10.615 --> 29:12.919
Thank you, Mr. Trick. That was
very thoughtful of you.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.487
Why do they always
got to be using swords?

29:15.520 --> 29:17.256
It's called a Uzi,
you chump.

29:17.288 --> 29:19.157
Could've saved your ass
right about now.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.393
You know, it's curious
how he could have gotten

29:21.426 --> 29:22.795
all the way into
my liquor cabinet.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.630
Allan, don't
we have...

29:24.663 --> 29:27.232
don't we have security
working in this building?

29:27.266 --> 29:30.301
Sir, I...
I had no idea. I-I...

29:30.336 --> 29:31.636
There's no need
to swoon, Allan,

29:31.670 --> 29:34.740
but try to keep things secure.

29:34.772 --> 29:36.808
Lock him up.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.811
He wake up, he's just gonna
try and kill you again.

29:39.846 --> 29:42.882
Yes. Yes, I expect he will.

29:44.782 --> 29:48.653
Vincent made a noble effort.

29:48.686 --> 29:52.191
Man to man,
as befits a true warrior.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.828
He had courage.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.298
He had honor.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.837
And I have jack to show for it!

30:08.640 --> 30:10.675
It's been
100 years

30:10.709 --> 30:14.645
since my enemy crippled me.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.516
Now ultimate power

30:17.548 --> 30:20.051
is within his grasp.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.221
And I shall not

30:22.253 --> 30:24.522
let it be.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.893
Forget about honor!

30:26.925 --> 30:28.727
Forget about everything

30:28.759 --> 30:31.829
but getting my amulet.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.865
Bring the watchers to me.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.868
Find the slayers
and kill them.

30:36.903 --> 30:39.404
Kill everything
that gets in your way.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.807
Go!

30:41.839 --> 30:44.576
Go!
(footsteps rapidly departing)

30:44.609 --> 30:45.844
BUFFY:
 Mmm.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.578
WILLOW:
 You like it?

30:47.613 --> 30:49.181
It smells good.
What is it?

30:49.214 --> 30:51.150
Just a little
something we witches

30:51.182 --> 30:52.851
like to call a
protection spell.

30:52.884 --> 30:55.020
Good deal, protection.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.422
I'm surprised, though,

30:56.454 --> 30:57.923
'cause usually
spell stuff's more...

30:57.957 --> 31:01.059
Stinky. Yeah, that's
why I added lavender.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.362
Give me time, and I
may be the first wicca

31:03.394 --> 31:06.365
to do all my conjuring
in pine fresh scent.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.200
So, what's the plan?

31:08.233 --> 31:11.369
For tonight's slayage.
We're going, aren't we?

31:11.403 --> 31:13.271
Yeah.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.374
Great.

31:15.406 --> 31:18.210
But... there's a but.

31:18.243 --> 31:21.579
And that's but you
shouldn't come tonight.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.648
Is that cool?

31:24.583 --> 31:27.019
Well, sure. Makes sense.

31:27.053 --> 31:30.888
You know... you'll be facing
big, hairy danger.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.692
Uh, b-biggest and very hairy.

31:33.724 --> 31:36.194
You'll be risking your life.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.564
Right. And why risk yours?

31:39.999 --> 31:42.134
'Cause I'm your friend?
I know, Will.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.603
That's exactly why
I don't want you going.

31:44.635 --> 31:46.738
It's-it's too dangerous.

31:46.771 --> 31:49.040
But I-I've done
this sort of thing before.

31:49.075 --> 31:52.644
Like, a million times,
and I can totally handle myself.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.580
Besides, minty fresh protection.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.083
So?

31:57.115 --> 31:58.717
(door opens)

31:58.750 --> 32:01.787
Ready? Time to motor.
Hey, Willow.

32:01.819 --> 32:03.454
Hi.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.991
Uh, I really should...

32:06.025 --> 32:08.660
But we'll hang out
later, right?

32:08.693 --> 32:12.298
Yeah. You go ahead.
I-I'll just get my stuff.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.906
(door closes)

32:21.940 --> 32:23.342
Stupid.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.612
You're quiet tonight.

32:26.644 --> 32:28.946
I just want
to get this done.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.017
Yeah. I'm dying to
test out the longbow.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.683
I think it might
be my new thing.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.619
I can't believe
you went back for that stuff.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.521
Hey, how do you feel
about getting some ribs?

32:36.555 --> 32:37.823
You know,
after we're done.

32:37.855 --> 32:40.291
(growling)

32:40.326 --> 32:42.961
I didn't say you had
emotional problems.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.695
I said you had
 an emotional problem.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.298
It's quite different.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.467
My attachment to the slayer

32:48.500 --> 32:50.769
is not a problem.
In point of fact,

32:50.801 --> 32:52.637
it's been a very use...
The way you've handled
this assignment

32:52.671 --> 32:55.040
is something of an
embarrassment to the Council.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.143
If you want to criticize
my methods, fine.

32:57.175 --> 32:58.943
But you can keep your
snide remarks to yourself.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.979
And while you're at it,
don't criticize my methods.

33:01.012 --> 33:03.648
The fact is, you're no longer
qualified to act as watcher.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.353
It's not your fault.

33:07.385 --> 33:09.954
You've done well.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.625
It's simply time for
somebody else to take the field.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.028
Now's a good time to start.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.067
(growling)
(grunting)

33:27.038 --> 33:28.440
Screw it.

33:35.012 --> 33:37.816
We got more coming.
We're never gonna
make it to the warehouse.

33:37.848 --> 33:40.051
If they keep coming one
at a time, we got a shot.

33:52.029 --> 33:53.598
Faith, no!
(grunts)

34:00.771 --> 34:03.842
Don't move.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.211
I didn't... I-I didn't know.
I didn't know.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.748
We need to call 911, now!

34:09.780 --> 34:11.117
Don't move. It's okay.

34:15.487 --> 34:18.224
I-I need... I need
something to stop the...

34:42.947 --> 34:44.614
We got to go.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.251
Come on, we got to go.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.027
Come on.

35:11.842 --> 35:13.478
Angel.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.181
Buffy.
I've been looking for you.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.751
Your hand.

35:20.786 --> 35:21.987
It's okay.

35:22.019 --> 35:23.422
I've just been at the warehouse.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.856
I was waiting for you.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.659
They got Giles.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.034
(siren wailing in distance)

35:56.521 --> 35:59.958
(grunting)

35:59.990 --> 36:01.992
The front. The front.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.994
Moisten the front.

36:04.028 --> 36:07.798
Oh.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.835
Oh, God.

36:11.402 --> 36:12.871
Oh, God.

36:12.903 --> 36:14.340
Doesn't seem
too promising, does it?

36:14.373 --> 36:16.742
Stay calm, Mr. Giles.
We have to stay calm.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.878
Well, thank God you're here.
I was planning to panic.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.679
WESLEY:
What is that thing?

36:21.713 --> 36:23.181
Ah.

36:23.215 --> 36:24.550
That would be your demon.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.184
You know, the dead one?

36:26.217 --> 36:29.521
There's no need to get snippy.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.257
Bring them closer.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.958
(growls)

36:36.193 --> 36:38.230
You know what I want.

36:38.264 --> 36:39.864
If it's for me to scrub
those hard-to-reach areas,

36:39.898 --> 36:41.567
I'd like to request
you kill me now.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.034
(snarls)
Ow.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.369
Are you out of your mind?

36:44.402 --> 36:46.070
This is hardly
the time for games.

36:46.103 --> 36:48.574
Why not? They're gonna
torture us to death anyway.

36:48.606 --> 36:50.376
You're not wrong about that.

36:50.409 --> 36:53.344
Now, hold on. We-we can
deal with this rationally.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.347
We have something you want.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.382
You have something we want.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.251
Hmm...

36:59.284 --> 37:03.054
A trade. Intriguing.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.222
No. Wait. Boring.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.125
Pull off his kneecaps.

37:07.157 --> 37:09.628
No! No, no, no.
The slayer g-gave it to someone.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.896
A tall man, a friend--
a friend of hers.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.431
I can tell you everything.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.434
Be quiet, you twerp.
They'll kill us both.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.469
But I like to have my kneecaps.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.472
You will tell us everything.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.474
Yes. Sir.

37:23.509 --> 37:26.311
What is this friend's name?

37:27.945 --> 37:30.416
I didn't actually catch it.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.483
Look, um, tell you what,

37:32.518 --> 37:35.085
let Captain Courageous here
go, and I'll tell you

37:35.119 --> 37:36.922
what you need to know.
How's that deal?

37:36.954 --> 37:38.724
There is one deal.

37:38.757 --> 37:42.293
You will die quickly,
or you will die slowly.

37:42.327 --> 37:46.097
The man who has my amulet.

37:46.130 --> 37:48.733
What is his name?!

37:48.766 --> 37:50.802
His name is Angel.

37:51.802 --> 37:54.139
(growling, grunting)

38:05.951 --> 38:09.019
(sputtering)

38:09.054 --> 38:11.155
Unacceptable!

38:15.561 --> 38:19.164
Unacceptable!

38:32.309 --> 38:33.545
Oh, Mr. Giles.

38:33.579 --> 38:34.813
Down!

38:52.731 --> 38:55.199
(grunting)

39:16.554 --> 39:17.556
(grunting)

39:44.483 --> 39:45.983
Slayer.

39:48.454 --> 39:50.088
You think you've won.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.391
(laughs)

39:56.161 --> 39:59.230
When he rises...

39:59.264 --> 40:00.731
you'll wish

40:00.766 --> 40:03.668
I'd killed you all.

40:06.336 --> 40:08.338
(exhales)

40:14.112 --> 40:18.083
Potestatem matris nostrae
 in tenebris invoco.

40:18.115 --> 40:22.052
Maledictum filium tuum
 ab omni periculo

40:22.086 --> 40:26.090
custodias nunc
 et in saecula.

40:26.123 --> 40:28.025
(rumbling)

40:40.105 --> 40:42.106
I don't understand
why Allan would miss this.

40:42.139 --> 40:44.141
He's usually so punctual.

40:46.512 --> 40:48.445
Did it work?

40:48.480 --> 40:50.148
Let's find out.
Open the cage.

40:50.181 --> 40:51.516
You sure?

40:51.550 --> 40:54.018
Oh, hold on.

40:56.387 --> 40:57.655
(chuckles)

40:59.324 --> 41:01.159
Okay, now we're ready.

41:29.521 --> 41:31.188
Well.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.463
This officially

41:39.496 --> 41:41.465
commences the hundred days.

41:41.498 --> 41:45.536
Nothing can harm me
until the ascension.

41:45.570 --> 41:48.172
(laughs)

41:48.206 --> 41:51.141
Gosh, I'm feeling chipper.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.911
Who's for a root beer?

41:53.945 --> 41:56.380
(chuckles)

42:04.355 --> 42:07.192
(knocking)

42:07.224 --> 42:09.427
BUFFY:
Faith, it's me.

42:18.769 --> 42:20.538
Hey.

42:20.572 --> 42:22.239
Hey.

42:26.577 --> 42:27.945
(door closes)

42:27.978 --> 42:31.717
So, I, uh--

42:34.753 --> 42:36.454
How you doing?

42:36.487 --> 42:37.623
I'm all right.

42:37.655 --> 42:39.657
You know me.

42:41.391 --> 42:43.762
Faith, we need to talk about
what we're gonna do.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.429
There's nothing
to talk about.

42:45.463 --> 42:47.065
I was doing my job.

42:47.097 --> 42:49.900
Being a slayer's not the same

42:49.934 --> 42:52.336
as being a killer.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.041
Faith, please don't
shut me out here.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.976
Look, sooner or later,
we're both gonna have to deal.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.378
Wrong.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.480
We can help each other.

43:02.512 --> 43:03.882
I don't need it.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.550
Yeah?

43:05.583 --> 43:07.485
Who's wrong now?

43:07.518 --> 43:09.320
Faith, you can shut off

43:09.353 --> 43:11.155
all the emotions
that you want.

43:11.188 --> 43:14.626
But eventually, they're
gonna find a body.

43:14.659 --> 43:16.894
Okay, this is the last time
we're gonna have

43:16.927 --> 43:19.264
this conversation, and
we're not even having it now.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.632
You understand me?
There is no body.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.068
I took it,
weighted it,

43:23.101 --> 43:26.570
and dumped it--
the body doesn't exist.

43:26.603 --> 43:27.905
Getting rid of the evidence

43:27.938 --> 43:29.807
doesn't make
the problem go away.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.277
It does for me.

43:32.309 --> 43:34.411
Faith, you don't get it.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.581
You killed a man.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.615
No, you don't get it.

43:40.217 --> 43:42.219
I don't care.

44:24.929 --> 44:27.364
Grr. Argh.
