00:21.570 --> 00:22.929
[cheers and applause]

00:22.929 --> 00:26.170
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:26.170 --> 00:29.929
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.929
[cheers and applause]

00:38.729 --> 00:40.729
- Welcome to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

00:40.729 --> 00:43.000
We're here
in the Penn & Teller Theater

00:43.000 --> 00:45.299
on a show named after
Penn and Teller

00:45.299 --> 00:47.630
where the acts try
to stump Penn and Teller

00:47.630 --> 00:50.570
for a chance to perform
with Penn and Teller.

00:50.570 --> 00:51.770
Let's get the show started

00:51.770 --> 00:54.969
and bring out
the amazing duo themselves.

00:54.969 --> 00:58.630
Shoot.
I'm blanking on their names.

00:58.630 --> 01:01.469
Oh, right.
Penn and Teller!

01:01.469 --> 01:04.468
[cheers and applause]

01:09.129 --> 01:12.269
Oh! [giggles]
Sorry!

01:12.269 --> 01:14.530
Whoo!

01:14.530 --> 01:16.400
Saved you seats.

01:20.799 --> 01:22.870
Let the games begin.

01:22.870 --> 01:25.299
Let's meet our first
potential fooler.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.200
- My name is Xavier Mortimer.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.400
I'm originally from France.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.500
Since I was a kid,
I was fascinated

01:34.500 --> 01:37.069
by the early era of cinema.

01:37.069 --> 01:40.400
People like Charlie Chaplin
and Buster Keaton.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.670
When I do a trick,

01:41.670 --> 01:43.770
I want to touch people
by a story,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.569
or I want to be silly, goofy,

01:45.569 --> 01:47.530
or just beautiful.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.170
I was on "Fool Us" last year,

01:51.170 --> 01:54.700
but my last performance,
I didn't fool them.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.099
The trick that I'm bringing,
I've created it.

01:57.099 --> 01:58.500
There's something in this trick

01:58.500 --> 02:01.670
that has fooled everyone
that I've seen.

02:01.670 --> 02:02.969
This time on "Fool Us,"

02:02.969 --> 02:04.530
I'm hoping to fool
Penn and Teller.

02:04.530 --> 02:06.329
That would be cool.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.500
- This next brave performer
is ready

02:12.500 --> 02:15.569
to take the "Fool Us" challenge
for a second time.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.400
Either that, or he's a glutton
for punishment.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.329
Here's Xavier!

02:20.329 --> 02:23.329
[cheers and applause]

02:24.400 --> 02:27.069
- Hi.
Thank you for having me again.

02:27.069 --> 02:29.069
I'm glad to be back on the show.

02:29.069 --> 02:31.469
When I do magic
I like to tell stories,

02:31.469 --> 02:36.430
and today I want to tell you
a story from my childhood.

02:36.430 --> 02:39.430
This is me when
I was eight years old.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.030
There was this one girl.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.629
I was completely
in love with her.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.430
One day I saw her jumping rope
by herself.

02:45.430 --> 02:47.530
I took a deep breath,
walked over,

02:47.530 --> 02:48.370
and I said...

02:48.370 --> 02:49.430
- Hello.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.469
- I'm practicing
because I want to jump higher

02:51.469 --> 02:53.699
than anyone else in the world.

02:53.699 --> 02:55.469
- That's cool.

02:55.469 --> 02:58.030
- Try.

02:58.030 --> 03:01.099
[school bell rings]

03:05.469 --> 03:07.500
- I really wanted
to impress her,

03:07.500 --> 03:10.729
so I've been practicing a lot.

03:10.729 --> 03:12.270
Let me show you.

03:12.270 --> 03:15.270
[mellow instrumental music]

03:15.270 --> 03:17.599

03:17.599 --> 03:20.599

03:20.599 --> 03:28.599

03:28.599 --> 03:31.599
[cheers and applause]

03:51.569 --> 03:54.569
[cheers and applause]

03:56.030 --> 03:58.870
- Ladies and gentlemen, Xavier!

03:58.870 --> 04:01.930
[cheers and applause]

04:04.030 --> 04:05.599
Where did this story come from?

04:05.599 --> 04:08.469
- So it's funny,
'cause I dreamt of it,

04:08.469 --> 04:10.400
and when I woke up I was like,

04:10.400 --> 04:15.169
"Oh, there's this cool picture
of flying with a jump rope,"

04:15.169 --> 04:17.370
and I was like, "Okay.
Now let's do it."

04:17.370 --> 04:18.870
I really thought
it was impossible,

04:18.870 --> 04:21.500
but I've been working on it,
and now here it is.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.370
- Wow, so then you had
to sort of

04:23.370 --> 04:25.600
make that dream come to be.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.100
- Yeah.
- So how long does that take?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.370
- It took me two years
to work on the project.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.269
It's a long process.

04:31.269 --> 04:34.230
I had to figure the concept,
how it can be done,

04:34.230 --> 04:37.170
and then work on
how to present it,

04:37.170 --> 04:38.899
and have a story of it,

04:38.899 --> 04:41.569
and make it enjoyable
and entertaining.

04:41.569 --> 04:43.529
- All right, well,
I think the guys are ready,

04:43.529 --> 04:46.399
so let's see
what Penn and Teller think.

04:46.399 --> 04:48.300
Guys?
- Oh, man.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.329
You can come back
as much as you want.

04:50.329 --> 04:52.329
That's such beautiful stuff
you do.

04:52.329 --> 04:54.170
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.199
- Everybody that does
a levitation--

04:56.199 --> 05:00.230
the first thing they need to do
is to bring out the stupid hoop

05:00.230 --> 05:02.470
and show the hoop
to show there's no wires.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.699
And your idea of bringing in
a jump rope,

05:04.699 --> 05:06.399
which goes all
the way around you,

05:06.399 --> 05:08.300
the same way as a hoop,

05:08.300 --> 05:10.470
and demonstrates that there are
no wires going above you

05:10.470 --> 05:13.500
or around you
is a terrific thing.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.829
Also, you know,

05:14.829 --> 05:16.870
there's such good thinking
behind this,

05:16.870 --> 05:20.329
because we always think
for a levitation

05:20.329 --> 05:22.670
that something comes from above
and picks you up.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.100
Whenever they're doing
a levitation on Broadway,

05:25.100 --> 05:26.629
they throw a wire in
up above here,

05:26.629 --> 05:28.329
and a guy pulling from the back,

05:28.329 --> 05:30.670
and up you go,
and it doesn't fool anybody.

05:30.670 --> 05:33.430
This I think fooled
an awful lot of people,

05:33.430 --> 05:36.699
but we know
that you are a little more like

05:36.699 --> 05:38.430
a dancing handkerchief

05:38.430 --> 05:41.329
than you are like a "Peter Pan"
levitation on Broadway,

05:41.329 --> 05:43.500
and that that's
what makes this so clever,

05:43.500 --> 05:46.930
and what will fool
I think almost everybody.

05:46.930 --> 05:51.329
- Do you find yourself
relating to a handkerchief?

05:51.329 --> 05:53.800
Does that make sense to you?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.399
- Yeah, but...

05:56.399 --> 05:58.000
I think that the idea is...

05:58.000 --> 06:01.029
how come the jump rope
goes around--

06:01.029 --> 06:02.430
- Oh, I see.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.899
Do you want to maybe whisper
to him a little bit

06:03.899 --> 06:06.430
or something,
to talk about that?

06:06.430 --> 06:09.000
Because I'm afraid if I say more
I'm going to say too much.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.629
- All right.
I think Teller might--

06:10.629 --> 06:11.769
- I really don't want
to blow this guy.

06:11.769 --> 06:14.300
- He might give you a drawing.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.470
I'm going to pretend that Penn's
distracting me so I don't look.

06:16.470 --> 06:20.300
- Can I show you something?
Please.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.230
- Oh.
Oh, wait.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.600
Wait a second.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.199
- Well, I guess I better
get my ass up here.

06:28.199 --> 06:29.730
- Wait.
Wait. Yeah.

06:29.730 --> 06:32.129
- It might get serious.

06:32.129 --> 06:35.069
- This might be
something different.

06:35.069 --> 06:36.930
- If it's going to be serious,
I want to be here.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.399
- I want you here.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.129
I need you.
Oh, wait.

06:41.129 --> 06:42.399
- Okay.

06:42.399 --> 06:44.300
- I think Teller just said
the magic words

06:44.300 --> 06:46.199
that you guys
aren't going to hear.

06:46.199 --> 06:47.569
- Xavier, what do you think?

06:47.569 --> 06:49.800
Were you--
Did you fool them?

06:49.800 --> 06:53.269
- No.
He's right.

06:53.269 --> 06:54.629
- Okay! All right.
- Okay, good.

06:54.629 --> 06:55.699
Beautiful job.

06:55.699 --> 06:57.699
Beautiful job.
Beautiful job.

06:57.699 --> 06:59.529
[applause]

06:59.529 --> 07:01.000
- Thank you.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.569
Xavier, thank you very much.

07:03.569 --> 07:04.569
That was beautiful.

07:04.569 --> 07:07.199
Thank you.
All right.

07:08.730 --> 07:10.569
We've got more magic coming up,

07:10.569 --> 07:14.269
including a trick
by Penn and Teller!

07:14.269 --> 07:17.269
[jazz music]

07:24.230 --> 07:27.230
[jazz music]

07:28.670 --> 07:30.269
- Welcome back
to "Fool Us"

07:30.269 --> 07:32.500
where magicians bring
all the magic with them,

07:32.500 --> 07:34.329
and we don't help them at all.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.470
It keeps our show
honest and cheap.

07:36.470 --> 07:39.569
Let's meet our next
cost-efficient fooler.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.199
- When I first started--
early '70s--

07:45.199 --> 07:46.170
I was a little edgier.

07:46.170 --> 07:48.129
I was the "Rocky Horror"
magician,

07:48.129 --> 07:51.129
because I wore
women's clothes in my act,

07:51.129 --> 07:54.230
and in 1977 or '78,
I started opening

07:54.230 --> 07:56.829
for some of the top rock
and roll people in the country.

07:56.829 --> 08:00.199
And that lifestyle was
just as you might imagine.

08:00.199 --> 08:02.800
The first time Penn and Teller
and I were together,

08:02.800 --> 08:04.870
we were on a show,
and they were the hosts.

08:04.870 --> 08:06.899
This is 1994 or '95,

08:06.899 --> 08:09.529
and we worked with
all the comedy magicians

08:09.529 --> 08:11.199
that they felt significant,

08:11.199 --> 08:13.269
and I was very honored
to be on that show with them.

08:13.269 --> 08:15.600
There's one thing
that I'm doing in this show

08:15.600 --> 08:17.800
that I don't think
Penn and Teller are aware of.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.370
Watch me, fellas.
Watch me fool you.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.370
[cheers and applause]

08:25.769 --> 08:30.769
- Please welcome the comedy
magic of Fielding West.

08:30.769 --> 08:33.870
- Thank you all so much.

08:33.870 --> 08:35.269
Thank you.
It gives me great pleasure

08:35.269 --> 08:37.299
to be here to fool
Penn and Teller tonight.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.600
I'm going to get somebody
from the audience

08:39.600 --> 08:40.669
to help me for just a moment.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.669
I got a young lady right here.
Hi.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.830
Would you examine
this magical scarf

08:44.830 --> 08:46.500
for just a second, please?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.000
Thank you. Okay.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.330
No, no, no.

08:49.330 --> 08:50.769
I'm not going to tease you.

08:50.769 --> 08:52.830
I just want you to give me--
hit my hand like that.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.470
You know, they call that
"give me five."

08:54.470 --> 08:56.169
Is that what that expression--
give me five?

08:56.169 --> 08:59.230
Okay, if you do that like that,
then you get this right here.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.769
Give her a nice round
of applause.

09:01.769 --> 09:03.230
Thank you.

09:05.669 --> 09:07.070
That's it.

09:07.070 --> 09:08.929
Isn't that a great trick?
That's what I like to see.

09:08.929 --> 09:12.330
I like to see a crowd
that really--hey, hey, hey.

09:12.330 --> 09:14.230
[laughter]

09:14.230 --> 09:16.100
I said, "Sit."

09:16.100 --> 09:18.899
[laughter]

09:18.899 --> 09:22.070
Give me five again will you,
for the--

09:22.070 --> 09:23.570
it happens,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:23.570 --> 09:26.730
I think we just have to be
prepared for the worst in life.

09:26.730 --> 09:29.899
For those of you
in the audience that have kids,

09:29.899 --> 09:32.230
you might appreciate
this little roll of toilet paper

09:32.230 --> 09:34.529
I have to carry around.

09:34.529 --> 09:35.799
Don't laugh.
[whistles]

09:35.799 --> 09:36.799
Thank you.
Hey.

09:36.799 --> 09:37.970
[laughter]

09:37.970 --> 09:39.200
Hey.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.570
Hey.
Whoa!

09:41.570 --> 09:44.299
There's a souvenir for later.

09:44.299 --> 09:45.299
Well, when I got kids
in the crowd,

09:45.299 --> 09:46.570
I like to do tricks like this.

09:46.570 --> 09:50.269
I say, "Hey, kids."

09:50.269 --> 09:52.700
For 25Â¢,
what hand's he in?

09:52.700 --> 09:55.029
[laughter]

09:55.029 --> 09:56.700
It's magic.
Thank you.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.000
Thank you.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
[cheers and applause]

10:03.370 --> 10:05.000
The bird's okay.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.070
Let me check.

10:07.070 --> 10:09.269
Yeah, he's fine.

10:09.269 --> 10:12.029
[laughter]

10:12.029 --> 10:13.929
Thank goodness that little guy's
into yoga, man,

10:13.929 --> 10:15.500
'cause when I cram him
into that one hand,

10:15.500 --> 10:18.070
it sure is tight.

10:18.070 --> 10:20.500
Speaking of tight, I think
this crowd's taking this stuff

10:20.500 --> 10:22.970
a little too seriously.

10:22.970 --> 10:26.070
You better come
out of there alive.

10:26.070 --> 10:27.899
Oh, this has never
happened before again.

10:27.899 --> 10:29.570
Okay.
Come on out.

10:29.570 --> 10:30.899
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it.

10:30.899 --> 10:33.899
My buddy.
Mr. Bob the Bird.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.500
Take a bow, Bob.
[applause]

10:35.500 --> 10:37.000
Cuckoo.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.230
Cuckoo.

10:39.230 --> 10:40.230
Cuckoo.

10:40.230 --> 10:41.730
[laughter]

10:41.730 --> 10:43.529
Cuckoo.

10:43.529 --> 10:47.029
That's me.
He doesn't have a microphone.

10:47.029 --> 10:49.399
You know, some people--I can see
the looks on your faces.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.970
You don't really feel this is
a real, live, breathing animal.

10:52.970 --> 10:55.129
Would you like
to pet him on the head?

10:55.129 --> 10:57.600
The lady that slapped my hand,
you want to pet him on the head?

10:57.600 --> 10:58.929
If you want to pet
the bird on the head,

10:58.929 --> 11:01.029
you got to get a good grip
on that little sucker.

11:01.029 --> 11:02.029
You got to reach right on down.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.629
You got to grab
that little head.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.429
You got to pull it.

11:06.429 --> 11:08.970
"I really love it in Las Vegas."

11:11.629 --> 11:14.100
Oh, well let me
put this back over here.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bob the Bird.

11:17.100 --> 11:19.870
[cheers and applause]

11:19.870 --> 11:22.799
- Fielding West, everybody.

11:22.799 --> 11:24.029
And Bob the Bird.

11:24.029 --> 11:25.929
- Go ahead.
- Hi, Bob.

11:25.929 --> 11:27.470
- Watch this.
Give her five, Bob.

11:27.470 --> 11:29.899
- Aw.
- There you go.

11:29.899 --> 11:31.600
Watch this.
See? No, no.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.100
You are so nervous.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.000
- Well, I'm scared you're going
to take his head off again.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.169
- Now watch, watch, watch.

11:38.169 --> 11:39.600
Kill!
- [exclaims]

11:39.600 --> 11:41.500
- Oh, no, no, no.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.129
I just do this little thing
for--sometimes I--

11:45.129 --> 11:47.000
[laughter]

11:47.000 --> 11:47.929
Are you okay?

11:47.929 --> 11:49.899
'Cause I've still got
the toilet paper.

11:49.899 --> 11:52.070
- I do.
I love your toilet paper.

11:52.070 --> 11:53.169
I love Bob.
- There you go.

11:53.169 --> 11:55.070
- I love Bob,
and I'm glad he's okay.

11:55.070 --> 11:57.429
- I want to tell you something,
if you'll notice,

11:57.429 --> 12:00.730
because I'm a real
big animal aficionado,

12:00.730 --> 12:02.899
there is no--
I don't clip the wings.

12:02.899 --> 12:04.769
This bird can take off
and fly out there,

12:04.769 --> 12:06.129
and do it anytime.

12:06.129 --> 12:07.929
- And does he like that I'm
petting him, or I should stop?

12:07.929 --> 12:09.600
- No, no, no.
This is--

12:09.600 --> 12:11.029
You are going home with her.

12:11.029 --> 12:12.570
- Yes. Yay.

12:12.570 --> 12:14.129
- There you go.
Watch this. See that?

12:14.129 --> 12:16.870
- Oh, my little sweet friend.
Hi.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.870
- [whispers]
Alyson.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.299
[cheers and applause]

12:20.299 --> 12:21.899
- Hi, Bob.

12:21.899 --> 12:23.129
Oh, they're ready--
let's find out

12:23.129 --> 12:24.700
if you've fooled
Penn and Teller.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.870
- It's really fabulous.
- Thank you.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.029
- You've put together
a wonderful, wonderful thing,

12:29.029 --> 12:30.200
and you do it with one bird,

12:30.200 --> 12:31.899
and even though
you rip its head off,

12:31.899 --> 12:34.370
smash it, put it in your hand,
and shove it in your pocket,

12:34.370 --> 12:37.000
you show so much more respect
than other magicians.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.669
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

12:39.669 --> 12:41.330
- And you know
what I'm talking about.

12:41.330 --> 12:44.870
The bird has a personality,

12:44.870 --> 12:46.899
and the bird
is kind of the star,

12:46.899 --> 12:48.830
and you make it a real--
you know,

12:48.830 --> 12:51.830
one thing we've said before
on this show is comedy magic

12:51.830 --> 12:55.330
usually lacks comedy and magic,

12:55.330 --> 12:57.429
and you have both,
and it's wonderful.

12:57.429 --> 13:02.100
And what people may not know
is the ripping the head

13:02.100 --> 13:05.169
off the dove
goes back to the 18th century.

13:05.169 --> 13:06.529
Bosco, right?
- Yes, yes.

13:06.529 --> 13:09.169
- But more important than that,
the ripping the head

13:09.169 --> 13:10.899
off an animal
and moving it around

13:10.899 --> 13:14.730
is described--
magicians in Biblical times.

13:14.730 --> 13:16.000
It goes all the way back.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
It's been around
for thousands of years,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.899
and yet Fielding West
improved it,

13:20.899 --> 13:23.470
because when you pull the head
off, you have the tendons

13:23.470 --> 13:24.799
and the little stretch thing,

13:24.799 --> 13:27.700
which is so much better
than Jesus did it.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.529
So much better.

13:29.529 --> 13:32.570
- Did you hear that?
- Is the award coming down yet?

13:32.570 --> 13:34.000
[laughter]

13:34.000 --> 13:35.870
- You know, the production

13:35.870 --> 13:37.830
would have fooled
the hell out of us

13:37.830 --> 13:40.169
if we didn't share
the same teacher as you.

13:40.169 --> 13:41.470
[laughs]

13:41.470 --> 13:42.799
- Listen, just to be compared--

13:42.799 --> 13:45.200
to be put in the same dove act
as Jesus--

13:45.200 --> 13:47.299
I think
this is fantastic for me.

13:47.299 --> 13:48.799
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

13:48.799 --> 13:51.769
- Well, thank you,
Fielding West.

13:51.769 --> 13:53.600
Thank you for my new pet.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.029
- And how about
for Bob the Bird?

13:55.029 --> 13:57.129
- And Bob the Bird!

13:57.129 --> 14:00.669
Bye, Bob.
Bye, Fielding.

14:00.669 --> 14:02.269
Thank you.

14:03.870 --> 14:05.629
More "Fool Us" on the way,

14:05.629 --> 14:08.299
including something
from the legends themselves,

14:08.299 --> 14:09.470
Penn and Teller.

14:09.470 --> 14:10.870
Stick around.

14:10.870 --> 14:13.870
[jazz music]

14:20.799 --> 14:23.799
[jazz music]

14:25.299 --> 14:27.970
- Welcome back
to "Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

14:27.970 --> 14:30.230
Let's meet our next trickster.

14:33.470 --> 14:34.730
- Hi,
I'm Caleb Wiles,

14:34.730 --> 14:36.269
and I'm the puzzle master
magician.

14:36.269 --> 14:39.100
I'm a little bit obsessed with
wrestling and Rubik's Cubes.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.600
I've been a wrestling fan

14:40.600 --> 14:42.669
since as long
as I can remember.

14:42.669 --> 14:43.799
I think that's where
I learned to have energy

14:43.799 --> 14:47.429
when I'm performing
magic on stage.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.929
Within the magic world,

14:48.929 --> 14:50.730
I'm known more
as a creator and a theorist

14:50.730 --> 14:53.269
more than I am an actual
performing magician.

14:53.269 --> 14:56.230
Magic is about
figuring out the puzzle.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.799
On a Rubik's Cube you only
have a certain number of colors

14:58.799 --> 14:59.799
to work with,

14:59.799 --> 15:01.299
a certain number of pixels.

15:01.299 --> 15:03.399
It's almost a magical object
in itself,

15:03.399 --> 15:05.769
the way it stays together
even though it moves about.

15:05.769 --> 15:08.570
Magic sometimes can be created
from very simple ideas

15:08.570 --> 15:10.730
and it can create
something extraordinary.

15:14.370 --> 15:18.970
- From Indianapolis,
please welcome Caleb Wiles.

15:18.970 --> 15:21.029
- Thank you.

15:21.029 --> 15:24.029
[cheers and applause]

15:24.029 --> 15:25.700
Tonight I want to try
something different,

15:25.700 --> 15:28.070
something that's never been
done before on this show.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.730
You see, normally the idea
is for a magician

15:29.730 --> 15:31.769
to come out here
and show you all a trick

15:31.769 --> 15:33.870
that will hopefully
fool Penn and Teller,

15:33.870 --> 15:35.669
but I want to take things
to the next level

15:35.669 --> 15:38.269
and do something
perhaps even more incredible.

15:38.269 --> 15:39.700
You see, I've created a trick

15:39.700 --> 15:41.429
that has been specially designed

15:41.429 --> 15:44.370
to be performed by somebody
who is not a magician.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.029
Somebody who doesn't
practice sleight of hand,

15:46.029 --> 15:47.669
Who doesn't read magic books--

15:47.669 --> 15:49.570
in fact, it's somebody
who doesn't even know

15:49.570 --> 15:51.929
I'm about to call her
up here on stage.

15:53.429 --> 15:55.029
Alyson...
- What?

15:55.029 --> 15:57.669
- I have created
this trick specifically for you.

15:57.669 --> 15:59.000
Would you mind coming up here
to give me a hand?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.370
- Okay.

16:00.370 --> 16:01.669
- And, Penn and Teller,
you can join me up onstage

16:01.669 --> 16:02.799
and get a front row seat
as well.

16:02.799 --> 16:04.200
Let's give a big round
of applause.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.029
Alyson, you can step
right back here.

16:06.029 --> 16:07.470
- Oh, wow.

16:07.470 --> 16:09.700
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.830
- So, Alyson,
if everything goes right,

16:11.830 --> 16:14.799
tonight,
in your first-ever magic trick,

16:14.799 --> 16:16.700
you are going to fool
Penn and Teller.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.470
- Ha ha!
- If something goes wrong,

16:19.470 --> 16:20.899
you are going
to take all the blame.

16:20.899 --> 16:22.230
- Aw.
- So no pressure.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.230
- Okay.
- But don't worry.

16:24.230 --> 16:26.129
I'm going to walk you through it
every step of the way.

16:26.129 --> 16:27.730
- Please do.
- In fact, we will start

16:27.730 --> 16:30.000
with the most basic step
for any card trick,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.529
and that is to take out
the jokers.

16:32.529 --> 16:34.799
So I'm going to spread
through the cards here,

16:34.799 --> 16:35.970
and I'm going
to take out the jokers.

16:35.970 --> 16:37.269
And as I do that,
Penn and Teller, you may notice

16:37.269 --> 16:39.299
that there are
some special cards in the deck.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.529
Those I prepared
for Alyson earlier.

16:41.529 --> 16:43.870
Those are some instruction cards
that are going to help her--

16:43.870 --> 16:45.370
kind of lead her
through the trick.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.529
In fact, the first one
is right here on top.

16:47.529 --> 16:50.299
So from here on out, Alyson,
you're going to do everything.

16:50.299 --> 16:52.429
You're going to be the magician.
I'll be your lovely assistant.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.700
- Okay.
- Okay? Are you ready?

16:54.700 --> 16:55.669
- Sure.
- All right.

16:55.669 --> 16:57.929
Ladies and gentlemen,
making her magic debut,

16:57.929 --> 17:00.769
the amazing Alyson Hannigan!

17:00.769 --> 17:02.330
[cheers and applause]

17:02.330 --> 17:03.700
- Thank you.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.000
- So, Alyson, you're going
to hold onto the cards,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.470
and I'm going to hold up
the instructions

17:06.470 --> 17:07.630
so everybody can see.

17:07.630 --> 17:10.730
Step number one says
to have a card selected,

17:10.730 --> 17:12.430
so that's a pretty typical step
for a card trick,

17:12.430 --> 17:14.069
and we're going to do that
in a very fair manner,

17:14.069 --> 17:15.430
'cause this is Penn and Teller,

17:15.430 --> 17:16.970
so I have an idea for this,
Alyson.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.829
I want you to deal the top card
face down onto the table.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.170
- Okay.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.269
- And then I want you
to deal the next card

17:22.269 --> 17:23.569
face down on top of that,

17:23.569 --> 17:25.430
and you're going to continue
dealing through the cards,

17:25.430 --> 17:28.269
but I want you to do it at a
very slow, deliberate pace.

17:28.269 --> 17:30.500
And the reason is, Penn,
in just a moment,

17:30.500 --> 17:31.829
you're going to call out "stop."

17:31.829 --> 17:34.000
You can keep dealing, Alyson,
but whenever you get the urge,

17:34.000 --> 17:35.670
you're just going to call out
"stop."

17:37.730 --> 17:38.869
- How do I--
- Stop!

17:38.869 --> 17:41.529
- Oh, my God.

17:41.529 --> 17:42.529
- Did you mean for this card,

17:42.529 --> 17:44.029
or did you want the card
she was about to deal?

17:44.029 --> 17:45.230
- I want the card
she was about to deal.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.900
- About to deal.
Now you are the magician here,

17:46.900 --> 17:48.569
so you don't get
to see the card, okay?

17:48.569 --> 17:50.470
But I am going to show it
to the audience.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.900
And we'll make sure
Penn and Teller get a chance

17:51.900 --> 17:53.369
to take a peek as well, okay?

17:53.369 --> 17:54.630
And we'll put the card here.

17:54.630 --> 17:56.029
And we'll move on
to step number two.

17:56.029 --> 17:57.400
You're doing good so far.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.630
Step number two says
to bury the card in the deck,

18:01.630 --> 18:02.930
so I have an idea
for that as well.

18:02.930 --> 18:05.470
Spread through until you get
to the next instruction card.

18:05.470 --> 18:06.930
Ah, it's almost right
near the--near the top.

18:06.930 --> 18:08.630
Take these cards
and put them on top.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.529
And actually, since it's so
near the top there,

18:10.529 --> 18:12.529
take the whole deck,
and put it on top as well.

18:12.529 --> 18:13.599
That way we know Penn's card

18:13.599 --> 18:15.670
is really buried down
in the deck.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.700
And you can pick up the cards
in your hand again,

18:17.700 --> 18:19.230
and I'll read off the next
instruction.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.700
So the next instruction--

18:20.700 --> 18:23.730
step number three
says to do the cut shuffle.

18:23.730 --> 18:25.500
Now, that's
a magician's term, Alyson.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.000
I'll explain what that means.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.269
Basically, you're going to cut
off about half the deck.

18:29.269 --> 18:30.569
- Okay.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.730
- And I want you to put
those cards on the table,

18:31.730 --> 18:32.900
and then the cards
that are left,

18:32.900 --> 18:34.569
I want you to give them
a quick little shuffle.

18:34.569 --> 18:36.099
- Okay.
- Awesome.

18:36.099 --> 18:37.200
- Not so good at that.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.269
- No, you're doing perfect.

18:38.269 --> 18:39.569
You're doing perfect, okay?
- Okay.

18:39.569 --> 18:41.670
- And then I want you to take
about half--you good, yeah?

18:41.670 --> 18:42.869
- Oh, yeah.
- So you're ready.

18:42.869 --> 18:44.099
Okay, then take about half
of those cards.

18:44.099 --> 18:46.500
Cut those down to the table.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.200
Perfect, and I want you
to shuffle those cards again.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.529
Just give them
a quick little mix.

18:51.529 --> 18:53.200
Perfect,
and take all of those cards,

18:53.200 --> 18:54.970
and put them right here.

18:54.970 --> 18:56.970
And now we'll move on
to step number four.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.630
Step number four says
to assemble the deck.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.230
Now, this is where things
get interesting.

19:00.230 --> 19:02.500
You get to stack them up
in any order that you want.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.029
Just make a nice, neat pile
on the table of all the cards.

19:05.029 --> 19:06.029
- Okay.

19:08.369 --> 19:09.529
- Perfect.

19:09.529 --> 19:11.630
So pick up those cards...
- Okay.

19:11.630 --> 19:12.970
- And I want you
to spread through them

19:12.970 --> 19:14.970
until you come
to the next instruction card,

19:14.970 --> 19:16.029
and we'll just hope
it's the right one.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.670
So keep going.
Keep going.

19:17.670 --> 19:20.099
I can see one
coming up here soon.

19:20.099 --> 19:21.170
Keep going down the deck.

19:21.170 --> 19:22.630
A-ha. Okay.
There it is.

19:22.630 --> 19:23.799
So cut these cards
down to the bottom.

19:23.799 --> 19:25.470
We'll put these ones on top.
- Okay.

19:25.470 --> 19:27.799
- And we need step number five,
and we have step number five,

19:27.799 --> 19:29.170
so that's a good sign.

19:29.170 --> 19:30.670
We'll look at
step number five next.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.269
It says, "Ask your participant
to shuffle."

19:33.269 --> 19:35.529
So that would be me, Alyson,
and I want you guys

19:35.529 --> 19:37.630
to watch this really
carefully, okay?

19:37.630 --> 19:39.700
I'm going to give
the cards a mix,

19:39.700 --> 19:41.000
but, Alyson,
and Penn and Teller,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.299
I want you to make sure
that this is not

19:42.299 --> 19:45.630
one of those fancy
magician kind of mixes.

19:45.630 --> 19:48.000
Those cards
really are being mixed

19:48.000 --> 19:49.369
all the way through the deck,

19:49.369 --> 19:50.869
and you can even see there are
other instruction cards

19:50.869 --> 19:53.430
that are now kind of moving
to new positions, okay?

19:53.430 --> 19:56.000
And I'll square them together
as fair as I know how.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.430
We'll square the cards up
just like this.

19:59.430 --> 20:02.170
And, Alyson, you can take these.
Now, here it is.

20:02.170 --> 20:03.599
We've had a card
selected in a fair way.

20:03.599 --> 20:05.470
You've shuffled the cards.
I've shuffled the cards.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.099
The card is thoroughly lost.

20:07.099 --> 20:08.329
Now we have to find it,

20:08.329 --> 20:10.430
so we'll move on
to step number six.

20:10.430 --> 20:13.099
Step number six says to deal
a pile of cards,

20:13.099 --> 20:14.470
so this is the exciting part.

20:14.470 --> 20:16.000
Now we're actually looking
for Penn's card,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.670
so I want you to deal
a card down there,

20:17.670 --> 20:19.329
and just keep dealing a pile.

20:19.329 --> 20:21.269
Deal quickly, so we can look
for the next instruction card.

20:21.269 --> 20:22.569
- Wait, wait, wait.
- That's all right.

20:22.569 --> 20:23.829
- I messed that up.
- Okay. You're good.

20:23.829 --> 20:25.670
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. There's the next--

20:25.670 --> 20:26.930
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

20:26.930 --> 20:28.529
"You're doing great, Alyson."
Keep the cards.

20:28.529 --> 20:30.599
Deal a new pile of cards,
so keep dealing.

20:30.599 --> 20:31.930
Keep dealing.
Keep dealing.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.630
Keep dealing. Oh, it says,
"Keep it up, Alyson."

20:33.630 --> 20:35.869
You're almost there.
I'm getting excited.

20:35.869 --> 20:37.200
Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.369
This is going
to be the next one.

20:38.369 --> 20:39.599
It says,
"You're killing it, Alyson."

20:39.599 --> 20:41.400
Hang on. Hang on.
- Oh, dear.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.730
- Penn's card is
only three cards away.

20:43.730 --> 20:45.970
So look, that's card number one.
That's card number two.

20:45.970 --> 20:49.269
Don't show this,
but hold onto that card.

20:49.269 --> 20:50.930
Now, I want you
to think about this.

20:50.930 --> 20:53.599
Look, you shuffled these cards.
- Mm-hmm.

20:53.599 --> 20:56.299
- There's no way any of us
could know the order, yes?

20:56.299 --> 20:57.400
- Right.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.700
I'm going to spread them
onto the table.

20:58.700 --> 21:01.069
Those instruction cards could
have ended up with any card

21:01.069 --> 21:02.500
in the deck.
- Right.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.670
- They led us to the card
that you're holding.

21:03.670 --> 21:06.529
For the first time, Penn,
what card did you choose?

21:06.529 --> 21:07.700
- Three of spades.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.269
- Alyson,
if that is a three of spades,

21:09.269 --> 21:10.730
we are all going to freak out.

21:10.730 --> 21:13.430
- Yeah.
- Show it to him.

21:13.430 --> 21:15.569
Did we get it?
Yes!

21:15.569 --> 21:17.769
[cheers and applause]

21:17.769 --> 21:19.500
- I'm so good!
- You're amazing.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.500
It's Amazing Alyson!

21:20.500 --> 21:22.099
- All right.
- But wait, wait, wait.

21:22.099 --> 21:24.069
There's more. There's more.
There's more, 'cause look.

21:24.069 --> 21:26.099
Penn, you stopped
on the three of spades.

21:26.099 --> 21:27.200
- I did.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.269
- You could have stopped
at any card.

21:28.269 --> 21:29.529
- I could have.
- But Alyson and I,

21:29.529 --> 21:32.099
we knew you would stop exactly
on the three of spades.

21:32.099 --> 21:33.630
Didn't we, Alyson?
- Oh, totally.

21:33.630 --> 21:35.400
- Yeah. We want proof.
We want proof.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.500
Look, you stopped on
the three of spades, and look.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.500
I have some other
instruction cards here,

21:39.500 --> 21:40.970
and on the back
of the instruction cards

21:40.970 --> 21:42.130
we have a perfect match.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.529
Look, there's
the three of diamonds.

21:43.529 --> 21:46.130
There's the three of clubs.
There's a three of hearts.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.470
A perfect prediction, but wait.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.500
There's more, because look.

21:50.500 --> 21:54.369
Alyson, had even one card
been displaced

21:54.369 --> 21:56.970
this pile could have been
in a completely different order.

21:56.970 --> 21:59.299
This pile could have had
more cards or less cards.

21:59.299 --> 22:00.869
This pile could have
ended up over here,

22:00.869 --> 22:02.730
instead of where it's at,

22:02.730 --> 22:05.970
so I guess there's
only one last question to ask.

22:08.200 --> 22:11.470
Penn and Teller,

22:11.470 --> 22:12.500
did...

22:12.500 --> 22:13.670
we...

22:13.670 --> 22:14.829
fool...

22:14.829 --> 22:16.369
you?

22:16.369 --> 22:19.369
[cheers and applause]

22:20.369 --> 22:23.369
- Wow.
- Wow.

22:23.369 --> 22:24.700
- Did you see their faces?

22:24.700 --> 22:26.470
- I did.
- We were really good.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.470
- They were impressed
by your card handling abilities.

22:28.470 --> 22:30.329
- I think we might get
a Vegas show.

22:30.329 --> 22:32.130
- We're the new duo.
- I think so.

22:32.130 --> 22:33.269
- I think so.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.599
- I think
I'll be the silent one.

22:34.599 --> 22:37.329
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:37.329 --> 22:39.930
So is this a trick
you invented for the show?

22:39.930 --> 22:42.329
- It is, so this is a trick
that's many years in the making.

22:42.329 --> 22:43.799
The original version--

22:43.799 --> 22:45.799
maybe it was six or seven years
ago I created--

22:45.799 --> 22:48.430
and I've just been refining
the method more and more

22:48.430 --> 22:50.630
and more until you see the final
product you saw tonight.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.500
- Yeah.
I like this though.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.099
I think we might get a trophy.

22:54.099 --> 22:56.829
Now, if you do fool them,
do I get to keep the trophy?

22:56.829 --> 22:58.599
- I think that would be fair.
- All right.

22:58.599 --> 23:00.769
I think they've had enough time.
Let's check in with them.

23:00.769 --> 23:01.799
- I think so.
I think so.

23:01.799 --> 23:03.470
- Alyson.
- Yes?

23:03.470 --> 23:06.130
- You did a wonderful job.
- Why, thank you.

23:06.130 --> 23:08.069
- It was really, really great.

23:08.069 --> 23:10.299
- Aw, thanks.

23:12.299 --> 23:14.569
I think it's a fool.

23:14.569 --> 23:15.869
I just--give us trophies.

23:15.869 --> 23:19.200
- That is such a beautiful trick

23:19.200 --> 23:22.130
that I'm tempted

23:22.130 --> 23:25.400
to cheat a little bit
in your favor,

23:25.400 --> 23:27.269
because I really want you
on our show.

23:27.269 --> 23:28.730
- I'm good with that.
I'm good with that.

23:28.730 --> 23:31.400
- But I also--
- No. We can just stop there.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.369
That's fine.

23:33.369 --> 23:35.529
- It's really,
really complicated,

23:35.529 --> 23:38.029
and Teller came up
with one question.

23:38.029 --> 23:40.599
And I've got
to tell you honestly

23:40.599 --> 23:43.430
I don't know the answer
to this question,

23:43.430 --> 23:45.700
and neither does Teller.

23:45.700 --> 23:50.269
And we're willing to gamble
everything on this one question.

23:50.269 --> 23:51.269
- Oh, gosh.
- Oh, dear.

23:51.269 --> 23:52.269
- Okay?
- Okay.

23:52.269 --> 23:55.329
- The hard part of this is

23:55.329 --> 23:58.599
how clean my selection was.

23:58.599 --> 24:01.170
I said stop
whenever I wanted to,

24:01.170 --> 24:06.500
so that selection
was either really,

24:06.500 --> 24:11.529
really real,
or it was really, really good.

24:11.529 --> 24:14.599
And if that selection
was really, really real,

24:14.599 --> 24:17.670
we should be able
to go up right now

24:17.670 --> 24:20.230
and look at the faces
of all those cards.

24:20.230 --> 24:23.069
If you want us to look
at those faces of those cards,

24:23.069 --> 24:24.670
that trophy's going to go down.

24:24.670 --> 24:26.230
So now, sir...
- Yes?

24:26.230 --> 24:31.730
- As great as you were,
did you fool us?

24:31.730 --> 24:33.130
- I did not fool you.

24:33.130 --> 24:34.869
- Aw.

24:34.869 --> 24:36.170
- But I'm very happy to be here.

24:36.170 --> 24:39.569
- And I tell you when you said
that, it broke my heart too.

24:39.569 --> 24:40.730
- Me too.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.529
- I did not want
to win this one,

24:42.529 --> 24:45.369
'cause you are so [bleep] good.

24:45.369 --> 24:46.730
- Well, thank you so much.

24:46.730 --> 24:48.630
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

24:48.630 --> 24:52.130
- Caleb Wiles, that was amazing.

24:52.130 --> 24:53.730
- Thank you so much.

24:53.730 --> 24:56.269
- Aw, thank you, Caleb.

24:56.269 --> 24:58.299
[cheers and applause]

24:58.299 --> 25:00.329
More fantastic magic on the way.

25:00.329 --> 25:02.029
Don't say I didn't warn you.

25:02.029 --> 25:03.329
We'll be back.

25:03.329 --> 25:06.329
[jazz music]

25:13.299 --> 25:16.299
[jazz music]

25:18.200 --> 25:20.369
- Welcome back
to "Penn & Teller: Fool Us"

25:20.369 --> 25:23.269
I've got a good feeling
about our next magician.

25:23.269 --> 25:25.299
Of course, I always
have good feelings.

25:25.299 --> 25:27.599
I'm a happy person.
Take a look.

25:31.099 --> 25:35.170
- Hi, I'm Kevin Hall,
the Magic Maniac.

25:35.170 --> 25:37.099
I came from a showbiz family,

25:37.099 --> 25:39.630
and I was kind of the black
sheep going into engineering.

25:39.630 --> 25:42.000
I design computer circuits.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.269
Did that for almost 20 years.

25:44.269 --> 25:45.400
I finally had a midlife crisis

25:45.400 --> 25:49.430
and wanted to explore
some new avenues.

25:49.430 --> 25:51.099
I became a professional dancer,

25:51.099 --> 25:53.400
but the costumes and the music--

25:53.400 --> 25:57.099
kind of a little embarrassing.

25:57.099 --> 25:59.630
Eventually, I went
to a magic shop,

25:59.630 --> 26:01.069
bought one trick, came home,

26:01.069 --> 26:02.400
and told my wife,
"I'm so excited.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.630
We're going to be magicians."

26:03.630 --> 26:06.069
And she goes, "We are?"

26:06.069 --> 26:08.630
I don't think
I'll ever leave magic behind.

26:08.630 --> 26:11.029
I think I've found
my place in the world at last.

26:13.970 --> 26:16.970
[cheers and applause]

26:16.970 --> 26:19.099
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

26:19.099 --> 26:22.369
the Maniac of Magic,
Kevin Hall!

26:22.369 --> 26:24.200
[cheers and applause]

26:24.200 --> 26:27.230
- Greetings.
Greetings.

26:27.230 --> 26:30.569
Yes, I really am a maniac,
so how about letting me hear

26:30.569 --> 26:32.569
a nice, "Hi, Maniac!"

26:32.569 --> 26:34.799
all: Hi, Maniac.

26:34.799 --> 26:36.069
- Well, that was nice.

26:36.069 --> 26:37.230
I was trying to be nice,

26:37.230 --> 26:39.099
and you're already
calling me names.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.569
Thanks.

26:40.569 --> 26:42.069
Actually, you know,
I think I know what you need.

26:42.069 --> 26:47.069
You guys need
some entertaining anagrams.

26:47.069 --> 26:50.170
Yes. That's when you rearrange
the letters inside of words

26:50.170 --> 26:52.430
to find the hidden words within.

26:52.430 --> 26:53.829
Now, I'm thinking,

26:53.829 --> 26:55.829
"Why use normal words
like 'duck toaster'

26:55.829 --> 26:58.700
when you could use
people's names instead?"

26:58.700 --> 27:01.170
For example, Penn Jillette.

27:01.170 --> 27:04.170
If you rearrange the
individual letters in his name,

27:04.170 --> 27:07.500
it turns into the somewhat
grotesque

27:07.500 --> 27:10.000
"teen jell pint."

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
You should be proud of that.
- I am.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.970
- But what's most amazing
is Penn's full name.

27:14.970 --> 27:18.069
Penn Fraser Jillette.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.500
It turns into this.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.500
Penn Teller fair jest.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.400
Now, that is truly amazing,

27:25.400 --> 27:27.970
and I think Penn's parents
deserve a round of applause.

27:27.970 --> 27:30.000
How did they know?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.970
Yes.
- Is that true?

27:32.970 --> 27:35.329
[laughs]

27:35.329 --> 27:39.700
- Now, we can have even more fun
by rearranging these letters

27:39.700 --> 27:42.470
to spell the name
of a very famous magician,

27:42.470 --> 27:44.799
and I think you all know
who I'm talking about.

27:44.799 --> 27:45.930
I'm talking about the one...

27:45.930 --> 27:47.930
the only...

27:47.930 --> 27:49.200
Rellet.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.029
That's right.
Harry Rellet.

27:51.029 --> 27:52.299
King of the truck stop
magicians.

27:52.299 --> 27:55.099
Star of stage, screen,
and restrooms.

27:55.099 --> 27:56.099
Oh, yeah.

27:56.099 --> 27:57.769
I could rearrange
these letters by hand too,

27:57.769 --> 28:00.200
but why should I
when I have this?

28:00.200 --> 28:02.130
That's right.
My magic tube.

28:02.130 --> 28:03.799
Oh, it may look empty.

28:03.799 --> 28:05.170
Oh, no.
It's not.

28:05.170 --> 28:08.130
It's a device that can warp
both time and space.

28:08.130 --> 28:09.329
Watch.

28:09.329 --> 28:14.000
No matter what order
these blocks go into,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.829
I can create the name
of another famous magician

28:16.829 --> 28:17.930
with a simple clap.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.900
Everyone? Bam!
[all clap]

28:19.900 --> 28:25.269
Yes, and we get
the incredible Rellet!

28:25.269 --> 28:27.329
[laughter]
No. I mean it's--no.

28:27.329 --> 28:28.470
It's not Harry Rellet.

28:28.470 --> 28:31.069
No. This is his
even more famous brother

28:31.069 --> 28:33.000
Larry Rellet,
you know.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.099
You know, the casino headliner
from the Motel 6

28:35.099 --> 28:37.269
down the--okay.
It doesn't matter.

28:37.269 --> 28:40.099
The important part is is
that we created a perfect match,

28:40.099 --> 28:46.829
and the letters are
only on one side.

28:46.829 --> 28:48.099
Ooh.

28:48.099 --> 28:50.769
Give it a round of applause
for Harry and Larry Rellet.

28:50.769 --> 28:51.869
The Rellet brothers.

28:51.869 --> 28:53.069
Very nice.

28:53.069 --> 28:55.769
Now, you probably already
realized

28:55.769 --> 29:01.529
that these blocks can also spell
another magician's name.

29:03.029 --> 29:05.799
Whoa. Even more famous
than Rellet.

29:05.799 --> 29:08.900
Yes, but can
the magic tube match this

29:08.900 --> 29:11.029
when we throw blocks
in at random?

29:11.029 --> 29:14.029
Okay, how about two Ls,

29:14.029 --> 29:15.200
and two Es,

29:15.200 --> 29:18.299
and maybe an R, and a T?

29:18.299 --> 29:23.000
Yes, can I actually get
these two stacks to match?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.230
I don't know.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.869
Everybody, let's get ready
and do it! Boom!

29:26.869 --> 29:28.869
And we have--whoa!

29:28.869 --> 29:32.099
The towers of Teller.
Whoa.

29:32.099 --> 29:33.599
That's a double shot of awesome.

29:33.599 --> 29:35.400
Give it up.
Yes.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.069
Man.

29:40.529 --> 29:41.930
What is this?
They're over there.

29:41.930 --> 29:43.769
They're saying,
"Oh, that's not enough."

29:43.769 --> 29:46.029
I cannot believe
that whole side of the audience

29:46.029 --> 29:48.069
is saying, "No, Kevin.
We want more."

29:48.069 --> 29:49.930
Say, "More."
all: More!

29:49.930 --> 29:52.329
- This side is saying,
"Kevin, we want control."

29:52.329 --> 29:53.900
Say, "Control."
all: Control!

29:53.900 --> 29:55.170
- And all of you are saying,

29:55.170 --> 30:00.730
"Kevin, we want to pick
the letters."

30:00.730 --> 30:01.799
Don't say that, no,

30:01.799 --> 30:04.470
because there's over 700
possible combinations.

30:04.470 --> 30:08.069
You think I should just let you
pick letters at random? Do you?

30:08.069 --> 30:09.970
all: Yes!
- Fine. All right.

30:09.970 --> 30:12.869
Teller, would you mind just
picking the first letter?

30:12.869 --> 30:15.400
Any one you want.
A-ha.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.900
T is a good choice.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.170
There we go.

30:18.170 --> 30:19.799
All right.
Let's see here.

30:19.799 --> 30:21.869
How about this gentleman
right there?

30:21.869 --> 30:23.700
Sir, what letter'd you like?

30:23.700 --> 30:26.000
- R.
- R. A very good letter.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.529
We'll go like that.
You know, this is too easy.

30:27.529 --> 30:29.799
Audience, we can have
this face up or face down.

30:29.799 --> 30:31.369
Which way?
all: Face down.

30:31.369 --> 30:32.799
- Face down.
Very good.

30:32.799 --> 30:34.500
Penn, would you mind
picking a letter?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.170
We got L, L, and an E.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.769
- E.
- E.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.829
Would you like that face
forward, face back, or sideways?

30:39.829 --> 30:41.170
- Sideways.
- Sideways.

30:41.170 --> 30:42.799
Good choice.
There we go.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.869
How about this lady over here?
Would you like to pick a letter?

30:44.869 --> 30:46.930
We've got L and L left.
You want an L?

30:46.930 --> 30:48.869
- I want an L.
- Very good.

30:48.869 --> 30:50.500
Audience, all together now.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.970
Would you like this upside down,

30:51.970 --> 30:53.769
right side up, front,
back, left, right,

30:53.769 --> 30:55.700
top, bottom, sideways,
or inverted?

30:55.700 --> 30:57.369
all: Inverted!

30:57.369 --> 30:58.869
- Inverted, I think.
Okay. All right.

30:58.869 --> 31:00.200
We'll toss this one
in the air like that.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.930
Yes. Here we go,
and we'll put it like that,

31:01.930 --> 31:02.930
and what do we have?

31:02.930 --> 31:05.769
We have a mess.
That's right.

31:05.769 --> 31:09.799
If we can actually fix this
with the magic tube,

31:09.799 --> 31:12.829
I think it deserves
a nice big round of applause,

31:12.829 --> 31:14.599
'cause think about it.

31:14.599 --> 31:17.170
No one could have
predicted this pattern,

31:17.170 --> 31:20.900
so can I use the magic tube
to make this mixed-up mess

31:20.900 --> 31:22.170
spell "Teller"?
Can I?

31:22.170 --> 31:24.099
all: Yes!
- Why should I?

31:24.099 --> 31:25.769
It's not "Teller and Teller."

31:25.769 --> 31:28.099
It's Penn and Teller.

31:28.099 --> 31:30.000
Yes.
I want you to get up,

31:30.000 --> 31:33.130
and give it up for the powers
of Penn and Teller.

31:33.130 --> 31:35.130
Yes.
- Wow.

31:35.130 --> 31:38.230
Kevin Hall,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.069
That is so cool.

31:40.069 --> 31:41.730
You don't seem like a maniac
at all.

31:41.730 --> 31:43.099
- No. Really.

31:43.099 --> 31:45.869
- So when did you become
a magician?

31:45.869 --> 31:46.930
- When I was,
like, 30-something.

31:46.930 --> 31:48.529
I had kind of a midlife crisis,

31:48.529 --> 31:50.930
and I decided that, "Hey, it's
time to become a magician."

31:50.930 --> 31:52.400
- Wow.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.400
All right. I'm going to check in
with the boys.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.430
- All right.
- Boys?

31:55.430 --> 31:56.799
Hello.
- Oh, my goodness.

31:56.799 --> 31:59.730
You know, this is usually done
with numbers,

31:59.730 --> 32:03.470
and you went to all the trouble
to do it with our names,

32:03.470 --> 32:04.970
and I thought
it was really great.

32:04.970 --> 32:06.730
I love the anagrams.
- Well, thank you so much.

32:06.730 --> 32:07.900
- And I love the way
the whole thing

32:07.900 --> 32:09.599
is laid out like this.

32:09.599 --> 32:10.730
I love how energetic it is.

32:10.730 --> 32:13.369
I loved you calling yourself
The Maniac,

32:13.369 --> 32:14.829
and I love duck toaster.

32:14.829 --> 32:15.769
- Of course.

32:15.769 --> 32:18.230
- It's so hard
to bring up words

32:18.230 --> 32:20.769
that really are just funny
just standing on their own.

32:20.769 --> 32:23.569
Are you good at anagrams?

32:23.569 --> 32:25.700
- Not that good.
It takes me a while to do 'em.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.269
- If I just gave you
a few letters,

32:27.269 --> 32:29.599
would you be able
to do a few anagrams?

32:29.599 --> 32:30.829
You don't have to do it aloud.

32:30.829 --> 32:31.700
You can do it in your head,
for instance.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.869
- All right.
- If I gave you, like, H.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.400
And I gave you, like, L,

32:35.400 --> 32:38.769
and then another L,
and then S...

32:38.769 --> 32:40.500
- Can I buy a vowel?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.329
- And then E,
could you anagram that?

32:43.329 --> 32:45.400
- It could be "shells."
- It could be that, yeah.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.700
- Could be, but probably
"hells."

32:46.700 --> 32:47.700
- Probably "hells."

32:47.700 --> 32:49.069
- Yeah, that's what
I would think.

32:49.069 --> 32:50.670
- You got an idea
of what I'm talking about?

32:50.670 --> 32:53.230
- I think I might.
- 'Cause this is--

32:53.230 --> 32:55.700
- You're saying,
"Boy, it's a hell of a--" yeah.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.069
- Yeah, I'm just saying
it's a hell of a trick

32:57.069 --> 33:00.200
is all I'm saying,
in my own little way.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.829
- Is he saying that,
or is he like,

33:01.829 --> 33:03.630
"Oh, hell.
He fooled me."

33:03.630 --> 33:05.630
- I think he's saying
I slightly puzzled him.

33:05.630 --> 33:08.470
That's what I think he's saying,
you know?

33:08.470 --> 33:09.700
I don't think I fooled them.

33:09.700 --> 33:12.970
- All right,
but the slightly puzzled award

33:12.970 --> 33:15.470
does go to Kevin Hall!

33:15.470 --> 33:17.769
[cheers and applause]

33:17.769 --> 33:21.670
Thank you, Kevin.
Thank you.

33:21.670 --> 33:24.299
- Bye now!

33:24.299 --> 33:27.529
- Performing next, my two
favorite magicians and yours:

33:27.529 --> 33:28.829
Penn and Teller.

33:28.829 --> 33:30.599
Back in a few.

33:30.599 --> 33:33.599
[jazz music]

33:40.529 --> 33:43.529
[jazz music]

33:45.099 --> 33:48.200
- Three years ago,
dance ensemble Pilobolus

33:48.200 --> 33:49.599
teamed up with Penn and Teller

33:49.599 --> 33:51.930
to produce
a one-of-a-kind performance

33:51.930 --> 33:53.799
of movement and magic.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.000
It was all based on one word:
escape.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.329
Ladies and gentlemen, for
the first time on television,

34:00.329 --> 34:03.400
Penn, Teller, and Pilobolus.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.900
[cheers and applause]

34:04.900 --> 34:06.900
- I'm Penn Jillette,
and these are my partners,

34:06.900 --> 34:08.570
Teller and Pilobolus.

34:08.570 --> 34:12.630
Harry Houdini is the most
famous magician who ever lived.

34:12.630 --> 34:15.630
He was known more in his time
as an escape artist,

34:15.630 --> 34:18.670
and he used not only magic,
but also incredible strength

34:18.670 --> 34:21.730
and flexibility
to accomplish these escapes.

34:21.730 --> 34:24.070
These dancers will attempt to do

34:24.070 --> 34:28.730
what we consider to be
some modern-day Houdini escapes.

34:28.730 --> 34:32.699
Many of Houdini's escapes were
against the police and in jail.

34:32.699 --> 34:36.699
In modern day America,
we deal with TSA.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.070
[laughter]

34:38.070 --> 34:41.230
Derion is about to go through
TSA in his own way.

34:41.230 --> 34:42.570
He's ready to travel.

34:42.570 --> 34:45.630
Please remove your shoes
and jacket. No belts.

34:45.630 --> 34:48.630
Make sure there's nothing
in your pockets.

34:48.630 --> 34:49.530
[laughter]

34:49.530 --> 34:51.400
Oh, no.

34:51.400 --> 34:57.199
He's got his P&T special-edition
Bill of Rights printed on metal.

34:57.199 --> 34:59.369
Take his rights
away from him, please.

34:59.369 --> 35:02.429
[laughter]

35:02.429 --> 35:03.699
Bag check.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.429
I believe all of those
are under 3 ounces.

35:08.429 --> 35:09.670
He's okay.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.369
All except for the switchblade.

35:12.369 --> 35:14.429
Yeah, put that
in the TSA bin

35:14.429 --> 35:17.730
with the rest
of the confiscated items.

35:17.730 --> 35:20.500
To be sure he doesn't get
into more trouble on his trip,

35:20.500 --> 35:21.599
he'll be tied in place.

35:21.599 --> 35:27.599
Both arms and both ankles
are tied and secured.

35:27.599 --> 35:30.929
This is a regulation duffel bag

35:30.929 --> 35:33.530
carrying Derion's pajamas.

35:33.530 --> 35:36.369
Probably should have
put them on before,

35:36.369 --> 35:39.500
but Derion'll be happy
to fly in his business suit.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.070
Overbooked?

35:41.070 --> 35:43.829
Looks like he'll have to go
into the overhead bin.

35:43.829 --> 35:45.170
Yeah, tie him up.

35:45.170 --> 35:47.699
Take him nice and comfortable,
would you please?

35:47.699 --> 35:49.730
Boy, it's a shame
he didn't get a chance

35:49.730 --> 35:53.570
to put on those pajamas,
because it's a red-eye.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.300
Yeah. Take him over there.
Make him comfortable.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.199
Make him nice
and comfortable there.

35:57.199 --> 35:58.329
There you go.

36:01.969 --> 36:05.829
And zip that up
nice and tight there would you?

36:05.829 --> 36:08.630
Get him in there,
and zip it up.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.929
And let's put
a cable tie on that

36:13.929 --> 36:15.630
and lock it into place.

36:15.630 --> 36:19.469
Wouldn't want that bag
to come open during turbulence.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.000
Make it nice and secure.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.769
Bon voyage, Derion.

36:23.769 --> 36:27.469
We'll see you in New York City.

36:27.469 --> 36:29.630
You know, Houdini was
about the first celebrity

36:29.630 --> 36:34.469
to pose almost completely nude
with just chains and locks.

36:34.469 --> 36:37.429
Houdini was overtly sexual.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.969
[crowd cheers]

36:39.969 --> 36:43.400
Houdini did many escapes
from chains and locks,

36:43.400 --> 36:45.769
but Houdini never did an escape

36:45.769 --> 36:49.730
when he was chained
to another human being.

36:49.730 --> 36:52.469
That pole between them is
secured to the platform,

36:52.469 --> 36:56.000
and it's 13' high.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.300
They'll be tied to each other

37:00.300 --> 37:04.269
and around each other.

37:04.269 --> 37:06.599
All of this bondage gear

37:06.599 --> 37:09.670
is from our local home
improvement store here in Vegas.

37:09.670 --> 37:13.199
None of it is gimmicked
in any way at all.

37:13.199 --> 37:15.769
There you go, Teller.
There you go, Jordan.

37:15.769 --> 37:18.730
Chain 'em up good.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.429
Here it is.

37:20.429 --> 37:24.400
The Gordian's stripper pole.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.769
Houdini dealt with safes,
water tanks, straitjackets,

37:27.769 --> 37:29.599
heights, ice, rivers,

37:29.599 --> 37:34.429
but Houdini never dealt
with duct tape.

37:34.429 --> 37:37.369
This is duct tape which you
would buy at any hardware store

37:37.369 --> 37:41.099
and duct tape that would be used
in any abduction.

37:41.099 --> 37:45.269
Teller is taping Jordan securely
to a solid chair.

37:45.269 --> 37:47.599
Both arms.
Both legs.

37:47.599 --> 37:51.429
And to make sure
that she can't get any leverage,

37:51.429 --> 37:54.829
he will also tape her chest
in place.

37:54.829 --> 37:57.400
Teller, make it
so she can't move.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.599
Jordan, sit tight.

37:59.599 --> 38:01.599
We'll get right back to you.

38:01.599 --> 38:05.400
Derion, we're just about
to take off.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.900
Matt and Shawn, here we go.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.900
[rock music]

38:11.900 --> 38:19.900
â™ª â™ª

38:26.400 --> 38:29.400
[applause]

38:29.400 --> 38:37.400
â™ª â™ª

38:46.469 --> 38:48.400
[clattering]

38:48.400 --> 38:56.400
â™ª â™ª

39:04.199 --> 39:05.630
Yeah!

39:05.630 --> 39:08.199
[applause]

39:08.199 --> 39:16.199
â™ª â™ª

39:19.829 --> 39:21.599
[laughter]

39:21.599 --> 39:29.599
â™ª â™ª

39:30.570 --> 39:33.570
[applause]

39:33.570 --> 39:38.599
â™ª â™ª

39:38.599 --> 39:41.599
[cheers and applause]

39:41.599 --> 39:48.329
â™ª â™ª

39:48.329 --> 39:51.170
Nice job, boys.

39:51.170 --> 39:55.099
And now, back to the duct tape.

39:55.099 --> 39:56.230
There's no beginning.

39:56.230 --> 39:58.099
There's no end.
It's sticky.

39:58.099 --> 40:02.369
It's strong, and there is no way
to cheat with duct tape.

40:02.369 --> 40:03.699
If you have duct tape at home,

40:03.699 --> 40:06.570
see if you can break out
of even one wraparound,

40:06.570 --> 40:09.369
and she has dozens
around her arms

40:09.369 --> 40:11.369
and dozens around her legs.

40:11.369 --> 40:15.469
Often Houdini's escapes
were timed.

40:15.469 --> 40:18.400
Jordan will also do
her escape with a timer,

40:18.400 --> 40:21.070
and her timer looks like this.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.230
[dramatic music]

40:23.230 --> 40:26.469
You can hold your breath safely
right there in your seat.

40:26.469 --> 40:28.199
Hold your breath at home,

40:28.199 --> 40:32.230
and think about how much harder
it'd be with this much exertion.

40:32.230 --> 40:35.599
Do not try this
or any other escapes at home.

40:35.599 --> 40:39.570
This is not faked.

40:39.570 --> 40:46.269
â™ª â™ª

40:46.269 --> 40:48.199
You ready, Jordan?

40:48.199 --> 40:50.070
Ready?

40:50.070 --> 40:52.230
Go!

40:52.230 --> 41:00.329
â™ª â™ª

41:31.170 --> 41:33.530
That's Jordan!

41:33.530 --> 41:36.800
Better than Houdini,
and in high heels.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.699
Ladies and gentlemen,
they defy

41:38.699 --> 41:40.670
the jails of the world
that hold them.

41:40.670 --> 41:41.769
Pilobolus.

41:41.769 --> 41:45.329
Matt, Derion, Jordan,
and Shawn.

41:45.329 --> 41:46.369
[cheers and applause]

41:46.369 --> 41:49.269
- Oh, my gosh.

41:49.269 --> 41:51.199
Wow!

41:51.199 --> 41:53.800
Thanks for watching
"Penn and Teller: Fool Us."

41:53.800 --> 41:56.869
We've got more amazing magic
lined up for next week.

41:56.869 --> 41:58.199
Good night!
