00:14.299 --> 00:16.529
C'mon Rigby, it will be over before you know it.

00:16.529 --> 00:18.319
Man, I hate cleaning the fountain!

00:18.319 --> 00:19.979
It's like the worst job at The Park!

00:19.979 --> 00:22.379
Why do we have to clean it anyways, isn't that what rain is for?!

00:22.379 --> 00:24.609
I know dude. But we just got to power through it.

00:24.699 --> 00:27.149
Here, I'll turn off the water, you start the hose.

00:27.149 --> 00:29.419
What?! Why do I have to start the hose?!

00:29.419 --> 00:30.859
It's your turn.

00:30.909 --> 00:32.859
My turn, your turn, what's the difference?

00:32.859 --> 00:34.129
We're a team, man.

00:34.129 --> 00:35.829
Then man up and do it for the team.

00:35.829 --> 00:38.529
- Rock, paper, scissors for who starts the hose. - Fine.

00:40.439 --> 00:42.449
- 2 out of 3? - Start the hose!

00:42.449 --> 00:43.829
Start the hose.

00:54.409 --> 00:57.289
It tastes like how Muscle Man smells!

00:57.289 --> 00:59.689
Yeah dude. But check out all this free stuff.

00:59.749 --> 01:01.909
All right, what's it gonna be this time?

01:03.579 --> 01:05.409
A bunch of baby ducks?

01:05.409 --> 01:07.659
We must have stranded them when we drained the water.

01:08.859 --> 01:10.329
C'mon dude, help me get them out!

01:10.329 --> 01:12.269
We can't clean the fountain with them still in it!

01:18.029 --> 01:18.969
Get the bucket.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.039
I wonder what they were doing in there all alone.

01:30.039 --> 01:32.039
Maybe their mom got scared off or something.

01:32.039 --> 01:33.399
Ready to get back to work?

01:33.399 --> 01:34.269
I guess.

01:41.519 --> 01:42.919
I think they're following me!

01:42.939 --> 01:45.599
Haha dude! They imprinted on you!

01:45.599 --> 01:46.129
What?!

01:46.129 --> 01:49.059
Haha, they did! They totally think you're their mom!

01:49.059 --> 01:49.989
Stop it!

01:53.719 --> 01:56.679
Quit following me! I'm not a duck!

01:56.769 --> 01:59.969
What are you doing? Trying to teach them how to suck at football?

01:59.969 --> 02:00.969
Shut up!

02:02.839 --> 02:05.519
Are you two finished cleaning the fountain yet?

02:05.519 --> 02:06.609
We're working on it.

02:06.709 --> 02:10.859
Oh really? Because it looks like you're just playing with a bunch of baby ducks!

02:10.859 --> 02:12.929
We're not playing! We found them in the fountain!

02:12.929 --> 02:14.749
Now they won't stop following me.

02:14.829 --> 02:16.409
They imprinted on Rigby.

02:17.009 --> 02:18.989
They think Rigby is their mom?

02:19.169 --> 02:21.279
That's the saddest thing I ever heard!

02:21.399 --> 02:23.939
No, I think someone naming their kid Rigby

02:23.939 --> 02:25.239
is the saddest thing I ever heard.

02:26.759 --> 02:27.649
Pfft, just kidding.

02:27.649 --> 02:30.449
But seriously, we can't clean this fountain if we're babysitting these ducks.

02:30.449 --> 02:31.449
Alright, fine.

02:31.449 --> 02:33.779
Find a place for those ducks and get back to work,

02:33.779 --> 02:35.779
and don't slack off.

02:35.779 --> 02:38.279
You still need to clean the park truck when you're done.

02:39.629 --> 02:42.309
Aw man! How do we get rid of these ducks?

02:42.309 --> 02:44.309
Easy. Chicks.

02:46.629 --> 02:47.809
Where are they?!?

02:47.809 --> 02:49.639
Relax! They'll be out in a minute.

02:51.139 --> 02:52.749
Get out of my cereal!

02:54.289 --> 02:56.229
Oh thanks a lot. You're a real pal.

02:58.519 --> 02:59.809
Step off!

02:59.939 --> 03:01.009
Step off!

03:01.009 --> 03:02.699
You don't want none of this!

03:03.899 --> 03:05.659
Who are your little pals, Rigby?

03:05.659 --> 03:07.939
Little pals? More like little jerks!

03:07.939 --> 03:09.439
Look what they did to my cereal!

03:09.589 --> 03:12.349
They made a baby duck milk waterfall.

03:13.539 --> 03:15.149
Get away from me!

03:15.149 --> 03:18.139
Aw, look! Now they're copying you!

03:20.949 --> 03:23.489
What's the matter, don't you like them?

03:23.699 --> 03:25.049
Is Rigby ignoring you

03:25.049 --> 03:26.909
because you're not a beautiful swan yet?

03:28.429 --> 03:30.859
Well we found them at the park and we're supposed to get rid of them.

03:30.949 --> 03:34.009
Actually, we were thinking maybe you guys could use some baby ducks!

03:34.009 --> 03:35.629
No pets allowed in my building.

03:35.629 --> 03:37.629
And I'm allergic to duck dander.

03:37.709 --> 03:40.059
I bet the Animal Shelter could find them a good home!

03:44.429 --> 03:45.389
Can I help you?

03:45.949 --> 03:47.619
We found these baby ducks and we-

03:47.619 --> 03:48.579
We want to get rid of them.

03:48.959 --> 03:50.509
We want to find them a good home.

03:50.509 --> 03:52.579
Alright, I'm going to need you to fill out some paper work.

03:52.579 --> 03:55.909
You can start by- Are those ducks karate chopping each other?

03:58.489 --> 03:59.399
No...

04:02.499 --> 04:05.489
I'm sorry, we can't take violent animals.

04:05.489 --> 04:07.709
Aw, what? They're not violent!

04:07.709 --> 04:09.499
Yeah man, they were just playing around!

04:09.499 --> 04:11.019
Those ducks are THUGS.

04:11.019 --> 04:14.609
You know, some people would think karate chopping was really cool!

04:21.819 --> 04:23.219
Now what are we going to do?

04:23.309 --> 04:26.129
I guess we're just gonna have to find someone cool to take them.

04:26.129 --> 04:28.079
That shouldn't be a problem. Check this out.

04:30.289 --> 04:31.579
They're not even flinching!

04:31.719 --> 04:33.339
That is pretty cool...

04:34.429 --> 04:36.039
And they're fast learners, too.

04:37.699 --> 04:39.869
Dude! These ducks are awesome!

04:39.869 --> 04:42.329
Yeah, man! We can't just give them to some loser!

04:42.329 --> 04:44.449
Don't worry, we'll find somebody to take them.

04:44.509 --> 04:45.579
Video game break?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.899
Video game break!

04:54.559 --> 04:56.149
Dude this is crazy!

04:56.149 --> 04:58.509
That's the third time in a row that they beat you!

04:58.509 --> 05:01.379
It's not my fault! I told you this controller's busted.

05:03.699 --> 05:04.759
Step off!

05:04.759 --> 05:05.819
Step off!

05:05.949 --> 05:06.799
I don't know, man.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.289
I think there's something special about these ducks.

05:09.289 --> 05:10.919
Maybe we shouldn't give them away.

05:10.939 --> 05:11.719
What?

05:11.719 --> 05:14.339
I don't know. I mean, maybe we should keep them.

05:14.359 --> 05:16.969
- What was that? - Huh? Oh, hey Benson.

05:17.019 --> 05:18.809
We were just saying maybe we should

05:18.809 --> 05:22.129
keep... looking for someone to keep... these ducks!

05:22.219 --> 05:23.749
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

05:23.749 --> 05:25.749
Are you guys done cleaning the fountain?

05:25.749 --> 05:27.439
Oh, well, no.

05:27.439 --> 05:29.979
Because we're still looking for people to take these ducks.

05:29.979 --> 05:31.179
I don't care!

05:31.179 --> 05:33.699
Find someone to take care of these ducks right right now

05:33.699 --> 05:36.209
and get back to work or you're fired!

05:38.949 --> 05:40.419
Not cool guys.

05:41.879 --> 05:43.599
Okay, how about this?

05:43.649 --> 05:45.149
Man, I dunno.

05:45.149 --> 05:46.109
Fliers?

05:46.109 --> 05:49.249
The only people who are gonna see these are some creepy old dudes in the park.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.349
We can't just give the ducks to some loser.

05:51.349 --> 05:53.479
Come on dude we have to do what Benson said.

05:53.479 --> 05:55.859
Besides, someone cool will take the ducks,

05:55.919 --> 05:57.859
you'll see. It's the right thing to do.

05:57.859 --> 05:59.929
Alright, let's go put these things up.

06:21.029 --> 06:23.729
I like the looks of these babies.

06:23.749 --> 06:26.609
- Here. - No

06:29.779 --> 06:32.069
Let's face it. These ducks are too cool.

06:32.069 --> 06:35.279
We're not gonna be able to find someone who we can trust to take care of them.

06:35.279 --> 06:36.789
See, I told you

06:36.789 --> 06:39.149
I don't hear you come up with any great ideas.

06:39.259 --> 06:40.369
Hey, cut it out!

06:43.019 --> 06:45.869
Maybe we can keep the ducks if we just hide them from Benson.

06:45.869 --> 06:48.229
There's no way! He'd find them anywhere.

06:48.229 --> 06:50.349
Not if we hide them in plain sight.

06:50.349 --> 06:53.919
They can stay in the bathtub and I'll train them to act like rubber duckies. Like this.

06:55.969 --> 06:57.679
Dude, that could actually work.

06:57.729 --> 06:59.929
Okay, now squeeze me so I can train them to squeak.

06:59.929 --> 07:04.749
Mordecai and Rigby! Telephone call for you inside!

07:05.529 --> 07:06.339
Hello?

07:06.339 --> 07:09.059
Um yeah hello, I'm calling about your ad.

07:09.059 --> 07:11.249
Are these ducks small and fluffy and yellow?

07:11.369 --> 07:12.199
Yes.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.789
Ohhh my babies! Thank goodness.

07:15.009 --> 07:18.599
I leave the fountain for one minute and next thing I know they're gone

07:18.779 --> 07:21.149
It's their mom. She wants her babies back

07:21.149 --> 07:23.889
Tell her no. We got the rubber duck plan all worked out!

07:23.949 --> 07:25.379
Come on Rigby, think about it.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.189
We don't know anything about raising ducks

07:27.189 --> 07:28.509
It can't be that hard

07:28.569 --> 07:31.329
You can't even feed yourself. How are you gonna feed a bunch of ducks?

07:32.389 --> 07:35.459
Good point. I don't think I've fed them at all yet. Have you?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.659
When do you wanna pick them up?

07:37.659 --> 07:39.079
I'll be right over

07:39.499 --> 07:40.999
Do you even know what they eat?

07:41.129 --> 07:42.679
I feel like dog food might-

07:43.359 --> 07:44.279
Hey!

07:44.819 --> 07:46.659
- Stop! - We shouldn't have left them alone!

07:50.729 --> 07:52.589
Hey! Open the door!

07:53.769 --> 07:55.929
We want our baby ducks back!

07:55.929 --> 07:58.899
Oh I think you mean my baby ducks.

07:58.899 --> 08:03.019
Sure was mighty kind of you boys to hand them over so nicely

08:05.099 --> 08:06.349
Ta ta!

08:07.969 --> 08:09.309
This isn't over.

08:13.209 --> 08:14.749
Where are my babies?

08:14.749 --> 08:16.919
- That guy just took 'em! - What?

08:16.919 --> 08:20.609
- I'll go get the cart. - There's no time for carts! Hurry, get on!

08:20.889 --> 08:23.689
Uhh, are you sure that's... I mean I dunno if-

08:23.689 --> 08:24.729
Get on!

08:26.189 --> 08:27.839
I'm not sittin' behind you.

08:27.839 --> 08:29.169
Dude, just sit in the back.

08:29.169 --> 08:30.519
You sit in the back!

08:30.519 --> 08:32.219
Let's play rock, paper, scissors for it.

08:39.799 --> 08:40.938
Where to go?

08:40.938 --> 08:41.739
Over there!

09:02.709 --> 09:04.719
Give me back my ducks!

09:32.699 --> 09:35.459
I'm taking those ducks

09:37.839 --> 09:38.919
Rigby!

09:50.229 --> 09:52.139
Step off!

10:05.489 --> 10:08.249
You guys are so cool!

10:10.209 --> 10:11.959
We're really gonna miss you guys!

10:11.959 --> 10:13.509
Yeah, take it easy guys!

10:13.509 --> 10:15.269
Remember what we taught you!

10:15.499 --> 10:16.689
High five?

10:19.149 --> 10:22.359
And keep practicing your video games if you ever want to make a living at it!

10:24.209 --> 10:26.709
Hey Mordecai and Rigby, thanks.

10:27.799 --> 10:30.909
For being the coolest losers we know!

10:42.499 --> 10:43.719
Woa-hoh, hey Benson.

10:43.839 --> 10:46.159
Alright so there's good news and bad news.

10:46.199 --> 10:48.689
The good news is that the ducks' mom came back and picked them up!

10:49.199 --> 10:51.439
The bad news is the fountain is destroyed.

10:51.459 --> 10:54.219
So we're probably gonna need another chore to do.

10:54.339 --> 10:56.359
Is there any other things that might need cleaning?

00:00.869 --> 00:00.869
Benson?
