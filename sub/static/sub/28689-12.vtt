01:09.390 --> 01:10.950
Thank you.

01:43.830 --> 01:46.308
After 30 years
of announcements and empty talk,

01:46.310 --> 01:49.908
this evening we are gathered here
to celebrate among friends,

01:49.910 --> 01:54.348
because the second airport hub
for Naples is no longer a dream,

01:54.350 --> 01:56.470
it is about to become reality.

02:02.150 --> 02:06.908
Firstly, I'd like to thank our hostess,
a great woman.

02:06.910 --> 02:10.467
The woman who currently
leads this consortium,

02:10.470 --> 02:13.190
Ms Tiziana Palumbo.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.668
The hemorrhage has been
completely reabsorbed.

02:44.670 --> 02:48.708
The amniotic sac is intact, blood-flow
velocity is good. You're lucky.

02:48.710 --> 02:52.748
You can be returned
to the correctional facility.

02:52.750 --> 02:57.550
All right, sir,
she's coming out now.

02:58.670 --> 03:02.030
Mrs Santore, I'll escort you
back to the correctional facility.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.708
- What is it?
- The Levantes tried to clip Patrizia.

03:18.710 --> 03:20.388
She's at the hospital.

03:20.390 --> 03:22.628
- And how is she?
- I don't know.

03:22.630 --> 03:25.628
But she sent us a message
and a request.

03:25.630 --> 03:28.988
- What message?
- She doesn't want to stay in prison.

03:28.990 --> 03:31.550
But she's only got one way to get out.

03:32.790 --> 03:36.228
Ruggieri. And the request?

03:36.230 --> 03:39.748
She wants to know if she's got
a good friend who can get her out,

03:39.750 --> 03:41.470
because she can't hold out much longer.

03:44.030 --> 03:45.470
Thanks, Fernando.

03:54.830 --> 03:56.630
The baby's all right, yeah?

03:57.590 --> 04:03.188
Prison's no place for a woman
in your condition.

04:03.190 --> 04:06.630
And who knows
what could happen next time.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.950
I want to speak to him.

04:47.030 --> 04:49.390
What are you doing in the dark, Gennaro?

04:57.510 --> 04:59.148
How did it go?

04:59.150 --> 05:03.790
Michele says hi.
He dedicated his speech to us.

05:05.070 --> 05:09.068
And you? Any news?

05:09.070 --> 05:11.270
Patrizia got the message.

05:12.430 --> 05:14.548
And?

05:14.550 --> 05:17.990
She just asked for a lawyer,
she wants the best.

05:19.830 --> 05:21.830
We've discussed this already.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.668
You don't need to worry.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.710
Patrizia won't talk.

06:40.790 --> 06:44.748
I'll tell you whatever you want to know,
but I have to get out now.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.788
I'm glad you've taken this decision.

06:47.790 --> 06:52.388
But let's make one thing clear:
you're not doing me any favors.

06:52.390 --> 06:57.030
I represent the state
and the state has rules and procedures.

06:59.270 --> 07:02.388
Firstly, you are obliged
to tell the truth

07:02.390 --> 07:04.668
and we have 120 days to verify

07:04.670 --> 07:07.828
whether what you say
is baloney or true.

07:07.830 --> 07:11.270
And in those 120 days
your condition can't change.

07:13.110 --> 07:15.310
I can't go back to prison.

07:20.070 --> 07:24.668
Maybe there is a way.
What do you say, Biagio?

07:24.670 --> 07:28.670
A spontaneous statement
that can lead to a sure conviction.

07:34.030 --> 07:35.790
Annalisa Maiocca.

07:38.430 --> 07:40.590
- Do you know who she is?
- Yes.

07:42.270 --> 07:45.310
We know that she's been missing
for almost two years.

07:48.910 --> 07:52.350
She vanished from the face of the earth
because I killed her.

08:17.350 --> 08:19.150
Good morning.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.390
Wait in the car.

08:26.950 --> 08:28.870
- How's Patrizia?
- Pardon?

08:32.190 --> 08:36.548
- Have I done something to you?
- You've got the wrong idea.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.908
And what's the right idea?

08:38.909 --> 08:43.188
I like to win,
I've always been competitive.

08:43.190 --> 08:47.110
Maybe I hoped my father would
come back for a son who's a winner.

08:55.630 --> 08:58.150
My father only ever wanted one thing...

08:59.790 --> 09:01.670
for me to be like him.

09:04.230 --> 09:06.550
But I've never been like him.

09:08.710 --> 09:12.348
And when I was younger
it made me feel bad.

09:12.350 --> 09:14.470
But then you know what I realized?

09:18.670 --> 09:21.390
That there are things I can do well....

09:22.950 --> 09:26.310
and other things I just can't do.

09:27.470 --> 09:30.188
I wouldn't worry too much.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.988
From what I know
and from what people tell me about you,

09:32.990 --> 09:36.550
I'm sure your father would be
very proud of you.

10:01.550 --> 10:05.588
Good morning, Giancarlo Presti,
court-appointed counsel.

10:05.590 --> 10:07.230
Good morning.

10:15.550 --> 10:19.748
Why didn't you include your husband
in the protective measures?

10:19.750 --> 10:21.988
You can save his life.

10:21.990 --> 10:26.228
He decided about my life without asking,
the consequences are not my problem.

10:26.230 --> 10:29.350
You're about to have a baby,
don't you want him by your side?

10:31.270 --> 10:34.390
He'd need to forget who he was,
break with his family.

10:35.550 --> 10:37.990
Only he can decide if he wants that.

10:40.190 --> 10:43.710
- Can we start?
- Sure.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.310
Wait here.

11:04.710 --> 11:06.228
Hi, Uncle.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.868
What brings you here again, Gennaro?

11:08.870 --> 11:12.668
- You know very well.
- You have to tell me.

11:12.670 --> 11:15.508
Patrizia will talk.

11:15.510 --> 11:18.468
She hasn't yet,
but I've got to be quick.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.428
And what do you want from me?

11:20.430 --> 11:23.710
I have to free her now, they're holding
her at a secret location.

11:24.670 --> 11:27.670
You're the only one who can find her,
and you know it.

11:28.670 --> 11:33.668
Unfortunately they've hidden her
too well and no one can find her.

11:33.670 --> 11:37.230
And even if I could do it, I wouldn't.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.188
I never liked her.

11:41.190 --> 11:44.228
But if she talks
it's a problem for you, too.

11:44.230 --> 11:46.150
Against us there's only her word.

11:49.950 --> 11:52.108
Maybe it's worth making an effort?

11:52.110 --> 11:55.868
The only one shaking things up is her,

11:55.870 --> 11:57.828
and she's one of yours.

11:57.830 --> 12:02.148
But before she shook things,
her house got shook up.

12:02.150 --> 12:06.070
- And it wasn't me who did that.
- Are you accusing us of something?

12:14.630 --> 12:17.068
My father wanted nothing to do with you,

12:17.070 --> 12:21.308
he said you've always been
poison for this land

12:21.310 --> 12:24.990
and that you would've been ready
to devour him and Secondigliano.

12:26.710 --> 12:31.430
Your father had a lot of faults,
but he knew how to see things.

12:32.830 --> 12:37.190
You don't. And he knew that too.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.630
My father always underestimated me.

12:57.430 --> 13:01.268
The youngest in the family is
Francesco Levante, known as Ciccio.

13:01.270 --> 13:04.508
You telling me this to get revenge?

13:04.510 --> 13:07.590
You asked me what I know,
I know them well.

13:13.150 --> 13:14.750
You know him too, don't you?

13:15.750 --> 13:19.630
- You know the answer.
- No, that's not how depositions work.

13:21.630 --> 13:24.070
You need to tell me in your own words.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.070
Welcome, Don Gennaro.

13:52.590 --> 13:55.748
I'm still waiting for your answer.

13:55.750 --> 13:58.868
Mistral says
he's honored by your offer

13:58.870 --> 14:01.708
and we're happy to give you a hand.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.070
In other words, we're at your disposal.

14:05.230 --> 14:07.350
That's what I wanted to hear.

14:10.190 --> 14:12.150
Let's go, guys.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.350
It took a big effort...

14:32.790 --> 14:34.870
but in the end we did it.

14:37.790 --> 14:41.070
A big effort
and for me it was an honor.

14:46.310 --> 14:47.830
Did something happen?

14:54.910 --> 14:57.350
I gotta ask you something important.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.950
Something I can only ask a friend.

15:04.230 --> 15:06.870
Because that's what you are, Tiziana.
Aren't you?

15:08.310 --> 15:09.830
Yes, I am.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.470
Good.

15:20.790 --> 15:26.070
Whatever happens,
from now on, my dream depends on you.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.430
But you must never let me down.

16:40.030 --> 16:43.268
Write down whatever
basic needs you have,

16:43.270 --> 16:45.388
I'll see that you get them straightaway.

16:45.390 --> 16:48.190
You'll find a change of clothes
in the closet.

16:50.870 --> 16:53.190
For anything, we're here.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.589
Gennaro, are you ready?

17:27.829 --> 17:31.708
- Are you all right?
- Sure.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.150
Then let's go.

17:54.870 --> 17:56.710
You're so beautiful.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.510
When you married me you gave me
the most beautiful gift in the world.

18:09.510 --> 18:13.748
I tried to be the man you deserved,
the father you wanted for Pietro.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.510
And you succeeded.

18:16.830 --> 18:20.990
I don't know, but I tried.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.870
I tried very hard.

18:25.590 --> 18:30.348
I did it for you two
and for my brother Ciro,

18:30.350 --> 18:32.390
who died to leave us with his dream.

18:37.630 --> 18:41.350
But in this new life
I felt a battle inside me.

18:42.510 --> 18:45.228
And what I was before began pounding,

18:45.230 --> 18:47.150
wanting to get out again.

18:50.270 --> 18:52.270
It hasn't come out, though.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.188
Remember one thing.

19:06.190 --> 19:07.750
What, Gennaro?

19:09.470 --> 19:12.268
All the dreams we have for Pietro

19:12.270 --> 19:14.710
will come true, I promise you.

19:23.910 --> 19:26.230
And the battle?

19:37.950 --> 19:40.230
The battle's over.

21:27.115 --> 21:29.713
I heard about your brother.

21:29.715 --> 21:32.553
The peace you sold us was bullshit.

21:32.555 --> 21:34.675
Peace doesn't kill people.

21:36.875 --> 21:39.555
But it's not made for people like us.

21:43.395 --> 21:45.555
Did you bring my friend?

21:50.795 --> 21:53.793
And where's my present?

21:53.795 --> 21:56.195
You'll get it before I leave here.

22:25.955 --> 22:28.275
Patrizia asked me to help her escape.

22:30.235 --> 22:32.595
And why did she ask you and not me?

22:33.955 --> 22:35.435
Do I have to explain it?

22:38.355 --> 22:40.515
Anyway, I can't do it alone.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.195
You know what it means?

22:46.315 --> 22:50.275
You got one last chance to show
your wife what side you're on.

22:52.635 --> 22:54.555
And what do I have to do?

22:56.755 --> 22:59.995
You gotta help me find out
where the cops have taken her.

23:02.835 --> 23:04.435
And after that?

23:06.075 --> 23:09.075
After that you gotta tell the Graduate
where Enzo's hiding.

23:42.035 --> 23:44.435
Pure'n'Simple, what's going on?

23:49.755 --> 23:51.235
Enzo, wait!

23:52.395 --> 23:55.033
Trust me, listen to him.

23:55.035 --> 23:58.353
And what can a rat tell me?

23:58.355 --> 24:00.393
The Graduate's on the move.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.073
He called all his men,
but he didn't tell us anything.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.433
And so?

24:05.435 --> 24:10.073
I think they're coming after you,
they know where you are.

24:10.075 --> 24:13.633
- Why you telling me this?
- 'Cause I made a mistake.

24:13.635 --> 24:15.715
And I also want to be forgiven.

25:31.795 --> 25:36.313
Don't move, you pieces of shit.

25:36.315 --> 25:38.195
What the fuck are you doing?

25:54.795 --> 25:56.715
Where's Enzo?

25:58.075 --> 26:01.755
I don't know.
I haven't seen him for days.

27:12.475 --> 27:13.875
Enzo...

27:22.835 --> 27:24.633
Enzo, we gotta go.

27:24.635 --> 27:26.513
We gotta go!

27:26.515 --> 27:28.915
Enzo...

27:30.075 --> 27:33.435
We gotta go. Guys, we gotta go!

27:55.515 --> 27:57.475
Sorry I'm late.

28:13.875 --> 28:17.675
- It was you who got Patrizia arrested.
- Yes.

28:19.755 --> 28:21.755
Why did you do it?

28:23.835 --> 28:27.395
- You didn't leave me any choice.
- You had a choice, Michelangelo.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.155
And you didn't choose us.

28:35.715 --> 28:38.875
That's why you're nothing to us anymore.

28:41.995 --> 28:44.675
Excuse me, Dad.

28:57.355 --> 28:59.555
I came to say goodbye.

29:00.555 --> 29:03.113
But first I wanted to thank you, Dad,

29:03.115 --> 29:07.753
because if family's
the most important thing for me,

29:07.755 --> 29:10.433
it's because you taught me that.

29:10.435 --> 29:12.513
As far as I can see,
you didn't learn it very well.

29:12.515 --> 29:14.715
You're wrong.

29:16.315 --> 29:18.595
You and I are more similar
than you think.

29:25.355 --> 29:27.115
Goodbye, Mom.

29:50.155 --> 29:51.795
Just a moment.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.275
Come in.

30:12.875 --> 30:17.435
We've been informed
your husband wishes to collaborate.

30:20.155 --> 30:23.113
- And they're bringing him here?
- Exactly.

30:23.115 --> 30:25.753
Ruggieri says that as soon as
you finish the depositions,

30:25.755 --> 30:30.155
you'll sign the statement and you'll
have new identities and residence.

30:32.355 --> 30:33.875
Thank you.

30:52.115 --> 30:57.715
I wanna kill that filthy bitch
with my own two hands!

31:01.835 --> 31:03.555
What the fuck's going on?

32:16.875 --> 32:19.595
Take a message to your brothers.

32:20.955 --> 32:23.115
Gennaro Savastano is back.

32:58.795 --> 33:00.115
Yes.

33:26.355 --> 33:28.393
We gotta go,

33:28.395 --> 33:31.833
for anything you need
my colleagues are here.

33:31.835 --> 33:34.595
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

33:39.675 --> 33:41.595
How are you both?

33:43.795 --> 33:45.475
Good.

33:47.355 --> 33:50.755
The second escort has left.

33:51.835 --> 33:53.675
Let's roll.

36:26.355 --> 36:27.955
Thank you, Gennaro.

36:30.235 --> 36:33.353
- Is it for us?
- Yes.

36:33.355 --> 36:35.193
Where's it going?

36:35.195 --> 36:38.395
Faraway, that way we'll all be safer.

36:43.875 --> 36:47.635
- Patrizia, can I have a word?
- Of course.

36:49.435 --> 36:51.235
See you up there.

36:59.835 --> 37:01.635
Goodbye, Gennaro.

37:02.715 --> 37:04.555
Goodbye, Michelangelo.

37:27.795 --> 37:29.115
Well?

37:31.875 --> 37:36.515
- This is your dream?
- It was.

37:38.995 --> 37:42.475
The truth is, for people like us
dreams don't exist.

37:44.835 --> 37:46.835
What will you do now?

37:47.835 --> 37:50.715
Tally up who are friends
and who are enemies.

37:51.995 --> 37:54.993
I gotta make up for all my mistakes.

37:54.995 --> 37:58.235
You made a big one: Gerlando.

37:59.875 --> 38:02.115
I've already taken care of it.

38:04.235 --> 38:07.313
The next one is the prosecutor.

38:07.315 --> 38:10.873
- What did you tell him?
- I talked about myself.

38:10.875 --> 38:12.995
Didn't he ask you about me?

38:14.315 --> 38:15.875
No, he didn't ask me anything.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.715
Help me to believe you, Patrizia.

38:31.155 --> 38:33.273
You know my story.

38:33.275 --> 38:36.953
You know where I come from,
I never asked anybody for anything.

38:36.955 --> 38:40.595
I never kneeled down
and I don't want to start now.

38:44.035 --> 38:47.233
I'd never betray you and you know it.

38:47.235 --> 38:49.833
You feel it inside.

38:49.835 --> 38:51.595
That should be enough.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.755
Remember when I told you
never to trust anyone?

39:13.955 --> 39:17.235
I never told you not to trust me either.

39:40.955 --> 39:42.515
Is this it, Gennaro?

39:44.195 --> 39:46.195
This is it, Patrizia.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.635
Don Gennaro, come with me.
