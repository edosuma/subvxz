04:12.200 --> 04:14.556
You have reason to fear me,
man of faith.

04:16.519 --> 04:20.639
I Hadrada king Ekerö, and
maker died.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.435
Many of your brothers have passed away.

04:27.160 --> 04:32.030
I let you wear their mourning
if you give me the book.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.996
There are currently no book!

04:38.520 --> 04:42.036
A long time ago,
trade flourished on these shores.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.992
Can fame of its beauty, its power
reached us...

04:48.320 --> 04:50.880
The word of your white Christ...

04:51.800 --> 04:53.792
There is talk of a glow.

04:54.480 --> 04:58.360
A light so bright that it dispels the darkness.

05:01.160 --> 05:05.393
The power of your god
will be my reward.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.112
This speaks  Christian Book.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.192
Speaks!

05:20.080 --> 05:22.311
- He disappeared from the abbey.
- No!

05:22.480 --> 05:25.791
There is no hope.
We must obey them.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.235
Traitor!

05:27.920 --> 05:29.593
Guards Book

05:29.760 --> 05:33.310
took him across the water, on the Big Island
,

05:33.480 --> 05:35.551
to put it in a safe place
in Iona Abbey.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.513
We will catch up and steal the Book.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.236
Drakkars's fill to the brim
and go home.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.200
Twenty nights crossing
for gold and silver, it is not enough!

05:48.360 --> 05:51.398
Our companions have paid with their lives.
This book will be mine!

05:52.000 --> 05:54.276
We will lose more men still
for a simple book!

05:55.320 --> 05:56.800
These beaches are synonymous with death.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.357
The Saxons have shown courage!

06:01.520 --> 06:05.912
They prefer  piss on their churches
rather than fight!

06:07.880 --> 06:09.075
We die on the reefs.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.194
All this for a damn book!

06:11.360 --> 06:13.556
Do not discuss my command!

06:17.080 --> 06:18.958
We will not leave without him.

06:22.720 --> 06:26.350
Fill longships,
take as many slaves as possible.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.159
They expect us off.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.951
We slay the guards and will collect the Book!

06:39.360 --> 06:41.670
What happens to it?

06:41.840 --> 06:45.277
This traitor? Drown it!

06:45.440 --> 06:48.990
The Scriptures never fall into the hands
pagan.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.675
Christ befall you!

06:52.320 --> 06:55.154
Christ befall you!

06:55.320 --> 06:57.198
You befall!

07:22.760 --> 07:23.955
Come on.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.230
- The King's Soldiers find us?
- Yes.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.600
They really come from?

07:36.400 --> 07:40.110
The lighthouse shone last night
signal has been sent.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.519
They come to our meeting.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.320
They will come.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.680
They escort us to Iona.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.431
We'll be safe in Iona?

07:51.880 --> 07:52.472
Yes.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.519
The road is long.
Let's go.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.397
We will seize this book.

08:22.680 --> 08:27.152
Whoever has
will be more powerful than any god or king.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.955
Talk about power?
From sovereignty?

08:30.760 --> 08:36.472
I am glad to be a man,
but you will be happy.

08:37.640 --> 08:41.554
Thanks to the wealth we report,
I am crowned king.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.188
No, we are a divided people,

08:44.360 --> 08:45.510
at war.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.998
You have to see beyond these bags.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.434
The world is changing.
Empires are formed.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.559
The Saxons are themselves
as invaders.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.715
Why glory elude us? Why deny

09:01.880 --> 09:05.430
my own beloved son
this power?

09:08.680 --> 09:12.720
Without this book, their nation will collapse.

09:14.920 --> 09:15.990
And you...

09:17.080 --> 09:19.072
You will become the king of this land.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.590
My brothers!

09:28.680 --> 09:31.957
Today, the power
white Christ is ours.

09:33.080 --> 09:33.877
For Odin!

09:34.960 --> 09:36.110
To Ekerö!

11:22.400 --> 11:27.111
The sacred ruins!
We will expect our guides.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.875
There is no one!

11:36.680 --> 11:38.512
They will come!

11:52.760 --> 11:54.319
I am old.
I'm cold and need to sleep.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.832
Found timber.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.072
Do not stray too far.

12:31.240 --> 12:31.878
Amen.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.517
So?

13:02.160 --> 13:04.391
Almost anything is better than nothing.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.313
They have abandoned us.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.513
God has abandoned us!

13:14.680 --> 13:18.560
It has not abandoned us.
They will come.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.433
Brother Erian repeated over and over again that we were warned
,

13:23.240 --> 13:25.118
that the omens were there,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.754
the people wallowed in
sin and death would befall us.

13:28.920 --> 13:33.153
It is believed that brother Erian.
Not me.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.395
- You should not believe it.
- "God punishes sinners."

13:36.560 --> 13:39.029
This is what he said.

13:39.240 --> 13:43.393
The kingdom of Angles around sinning,
according to you? I do not believe it.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.797
Although many people have to
away from Word.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.316
This is a time of darkness, my son.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.119
The pagans have destroyed our monastery

13:55.280 --> 13:57.033
killed our brothers.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.798
Were they sinners too?

13:59.960 --> 14:01.952
Have they removed the Word?

14:07.600 --> 14:10.991
These are the men who did this.
This is not a divine sanction.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.515
They will come. I promise.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.159
Where are we exactly?

14:58.240 --> 14:59.993
The chapel of St. Alchmund.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.156
Alchmund?

15:04.120 --> 15:10.196
He was the first pilgrim to spread the good word
in Northumbria.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.235
This is our most venerable saint.

15:17.560 --> 15:22.351
They say he overcame Satan the great deceiver,

15:22.520 --> 15:24.910
here in this sacred place.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.195
It also tells...

15:29.360 --> 15:33.274
When Satan realized
conversion job qu'Alchmund

15:33.440 --> 15:36.592
had carried on
pagan Saxons of Northumbria

15:37.760 --> 15:43.199
he tried, as he tried
Christ in the desert,

15:44.760 --> 15:47.275
= = but the Alchmund faith was strong.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.235
And he overcame Satan
stirring mountains.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.320
The sea began to boil,
rivers became blood red.

16:00.560 --> 16:05.157
Alchmund had overcome the darkness of his time.

16:08.280 --> 16:12.274
As we overcome the darkness that threaten to cover
ours.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.110
And if we fail?

16:18.320 --> 16:19.834
This is not us, my son.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.711
This book is the salvation of the kingdom of Angles
.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.397
This is his heart, his soul.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.958
Without the Scriptures,
this island is doomed to darkness.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.314
The old man that I am
must sleep now.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.918
A long day ahead of us tomorrow.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.109
Still nothing.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.357
Hurry up!

17:46.640 --> 17:47.790
Our guides us catch up.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.957
They find us!
This is the will of God.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.317
- You should rest.
- Let us hurry!

18:35.920 --> 18:37.115
Sit.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.399
Sit...

18:41.880 --> 18:43.519
I'll find something to eat.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.598
We need to leave!
Quick!

20:00.760 --> 20:03.116
Is coming. A soldier!

20:03.280 --> 20:04.680
- It is armed.
- A Saxon? A Nordic?

20:04.840 --> 20:06.433
- Quick!
- No.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.874
Do not fear me, priest.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.276
I will defend the Scriptures.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.157
I Aethewulf of Wessex.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.317
Your flagship indicated that you needed help.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.115
You are a messenger of the king?

20:31.280 --> 20:34.352
I am a soldier of the Eternal Kingdom.

20:34.520 --> 20:38.070
Our order dedicated to the protection of the divine word.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.352
But you are alone.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.915
We traveled to eleven
long.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.912
But the Nordic hordes attacked us.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.753
Ten others died.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.040
What can one man do?

20:52.800 --> 20:55.952
You know nothing of the world outside your
abbey.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.079
It is better to travel
as discreetly as possible.

20:59.240 --> 21:03.200
The same hordes have our island bag.
They massacred towers arm.

21:03.360 --> 21:07.149
They have launched numerous attacks on the coast
lately.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.676
Fini trade for them.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.512
- The shadows are thick.
- The Scriptures will be safe.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.195
Without them, the island is divided.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.714
I will guide you Iona!

21:20.200 --> 21:23.034
Let immediately.
The night approaches.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.958
- Too bad you're dressed as priests.
- Damage?

21:27.120 --> 21:31.160
The Church continues to grow and binge
while fasting people strength.

21:31.320 --> 21:34.233
The monks are frowned upon,
in wild lands.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.595
Come !

22:19.360 --> 22:20.999
We must continue.

22:22.000 --> 22:22.717
Wait!

22:25.720 --> 22:26.437
Wait!

22:28.640 --> 22:29.790
Wait!

22:34.920 --> 22:36.149
Silence!

22:39.480 --> 22:41.153
Do we slow down more and priest.

22:48.160 --> 22:48.957
Run!

22:49.200 --> 22:49.792
Run!

22:51.840 --> 22:52.956
Run!

23:35.480 --> 23:36.470
Take the Book.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.472
- No!
- I can not stand it.

23:38.800 --> 23:39.438
Please.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.474
The Cookie Book, or all will be lost.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.632
God be with you, my son.

23:45.640 --> 23:46.471
Run!

24:09.120 --> 24:10.554
Where is the book, monk?

24:11.160 --> 24:11.798
The Book!

24:36.840 --> 24:40.914
It seems that your white Christ
advocates a life of celibacy.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.360
A life of isolation.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.432
This would explain your inclinations
for boys.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.117
Pagan! Junk!

24:54.040 --> 24:56.555
I spent moons and moons at sea

24:57.640 --> 24:58.790
No woman.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.916
Only a few monks to meet me...

26:20.560 --> 26:25.476
You will burn in hell!

26:27.320 --> 26:30.279
In Hell? The hell?

26:58.360 --> 27:00.431
I want the book.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.232
The Book, and you shall live!

28:05.080 --> 28:06.912
We need to leave.

28:07.520 --> 28:11.992
Other Nordic will happen.
You cry your brother later.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.719
I could stop him.

28:13.880 --> 28:17.556
If you had tried anything, you'd
as cold as him.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.632
I could stop him.

28:23.040 --> 28:23.871
Come.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.190
We need to move forward.
Go!

30:12.120 --> 30:13.918
I'm sorry about your brother.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.074
This was more than a brother.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.550
He raised me.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.395
All taught.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.470
The Nordic pay.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.355
They followed us to the depths of the forest.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.435
Others will come again.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.718
They want the book.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.553
What they seek is its power.

30:53.280 --> 30:57.399
It should never fall into their hands.
They are crap pagans.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.799
All would be lost.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.270
My son...

31:26.080 --> 31:27.196
He fell.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.429
Where are you, boy?

31:52.720 --> 31:53.437
Pray.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.436
My son...

32:19.800 --> 32:21.200
My blood...

32:23.640 --> 32:25.438
They will pay...

32:27.360 --> 32:30.876
My wrath will come upon them.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.552
Blood flow.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.151
Thor What you receive in it.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.714
Odin make you own.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.552
They call you.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.600
They will welcome you in Valhalla.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.675
The good experience immortality.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.471
We should not mourn but celebrate

33:17.640 --> 33:21.793
those who have experienced a glorious death.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.320
We need to leave.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.952
There is no hope.
He ​​has abandoned us.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.759
No, not at all.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.231
What God do you know?

33:42.400 --> 33:44.915
You're a butcher,
nothing more.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.240
There are many ways to serve Christ
.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.880
Using a sword?

33:55.280 --> 33:56.714
Do not you see a resemblance
with your cross?

34:01.880 --> 34:07.239
While crawling at his feet like
in monasteries

34:07.400 --> 34:09.277
we protect His word by iron.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.715
By killing!

34:11.480 --> 34:16.429
Christ you do not give up.
It is in front of you!

34:46.360 --> 34:47.918
Let erected a pyre.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.797
And then we go back to
longships?

34:53.239 --> 34:55.357
The Saxons have to pay!

34:55.520 --> 34:56.636
Your son is dead.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.269
We lost half a day.
We risk our lives for your book.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.512
- It's over...
- Do not argue with my orders!

36:08.880 --> 36:10.075
What is it?

36:12.760 --> 36:14.160
From witchcraft.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.160
This is a warning.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.436
This place is cursed.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.560
Let's find another way.

36:22.720 --> 36:26.509
We are wilderness.
We must continue.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.555
Let us go in peace.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.154
Trash pagans!

37:10.320 --> 37:13.916
I'm not a pagan.
Let us go in peace.

37:17.120 --> 37:17.712
Who are you?

37:19.240 --> 37:20.640
Denegifu.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.792
We are the true followers of Christ.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.796
And they, who are they?

37:27.280 --> 37:28.191
Apostles.

37:28.840 --> 37:29.591
Who?

37:29.960 --> 37:32.156
From the will of Christ.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.350
The kingdom of Angles is dying.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.350
The people dies of hunger.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.070
Famine rolled those who survived the plague.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.231
We are witnesses of our own end.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.033
No living being will survive.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.837
We retreat into the mountains,
pending his final judgment.

37:53.160 --> 37:56.358
- No judgment awaits you there.
- Young monk, join us.

37:57.080 --> 37:57.797
Me join you?

37:57.960 --> 38:01.351
Your  monastery will not spare you from the wrath
ahead.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.079
The mountains either.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.671
Have you traveled villages?

38:06.600 --> 38:08.717
This is the realm of death.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.278
He punishes sinners.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.756
His word will be our salvation.

38:14.920 --> 38:19.312
Tell me, His word feeds the hungry?
Heal the sick?

38:19.680 --> 38:20.272
No.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.033
We need to accept death
He ​​offers us

38:25.560 --> 38:29.031
to sit at His side
paradise.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.159
Here is the Holy Book of Lindisfarne.

38:40.440 --> 38:44.070
Illuminated by Bishop Eadfrith,
in the presence of Christ.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.238
Here is your salvation.

39:01.920 --> 39:06.278
Before we embraced death
bless us.

39:43.280 --> 39:47.354
Be our defense against cruelty
and the wiles of the devil.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.159
We humbly pray
to give God the strength to reject.

39:52.880 --> 39:57.238
God by his power
throws Satan in hell

39:57.400 --> 40:01.030
and all evil spirits who wander
in this world

40:01.200 --> 40:02.634
to the damnation of souls.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.718
It was stupid...

40:27.000 --> 40:30.710
Do not show again the Book...
Not on these lands.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.554
They were desperate.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.630
This is why you must be careful.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.599
The Book
is too precious to put at risk.

40:38.760 --> 40:39.637
We all need protection.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.157
Only the account book.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.199
Try not to forget it.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.991
They can be anywhere.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.637
We do find more.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.520
We put their hands on it.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.159
Camp is up.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.000
So you never sleep?

42:17.880 --> 42:19.314
We must continue.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.751
How cold!

42:26.880 --> 42:31.238
We travel north.
It will soon be even colder.

42:34.640 --> 42:35.278
Come.

42:54.560 --> 42:55.789
Wait!

43:08.320 --> 43:09.356
We do not wish you any harm.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.954
- Many of you?
- An army.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.191
You will die here.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.114
- Where is she?
- You're in hell!

43:51.760 --> 43:57.472
My companions devour your flesh
and lick your lifeless body.

44:18.960 --> 44:19.837
A trap...

44:22.280 --> 44:23.270
This is the fault of this witch.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.233
This pagan bitch must pay.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.713
- This is a witch, look!
- Wait!

44:29.120 --> 44:30.031
Let-the speak.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.674
Who are you?
What is your name?

44:35.880 --> 44:37.109
We do not understand anything...

44:37.280 --> 44:38.270
Speaks!

44:38.440 --> 44:40.909
Eara! Northern tribes.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.072
She's lying!
It is the balance of these bandits!

44:43.240 --> 44:44.720
Why were you with these men?

44:44.880 --> 44:47.440
They trapped us and killed my family.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.829
You're far from home.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.913
Plague befell my village.
We fled.

44:52.080 --> 44:53.230
Are you Christian?

44:53.800 --> 44:55.996
- Liar!
- Enough blood!

44:56.360 --> 44:57.476
She wanted our death.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.797
Dispense innocent blood
condemn us.

45:04.320 --> 45:07.438
I do not want to take any risk.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.911
It will take us a ruin and destruction.

45:10.720 --> 45:13.030
Let's these brigands.
Let's Go!

45:13.320 --> 45:14.117
She has suffered enough.

45:18.240 --> 45:20.277
... Suffered enough.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.837
Must remove the arrow.

45:25.120 --> 45:29.478
- There are others?
- Yes. They will be back before dark.

45:31.800 --> 45:32.950
We need a refuge.

46:03.480 --> 46:08.350
Your wound is blue.
The arrow was poisoned.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.231
The poison is spreading fast.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.910
No antidote
he will not see the sun rise.

46:18.480 --> 46:22.156
An antidote?
Where could well find?

46:24.320 --> 46:26.073
It is all around us.

46:29.040 --> 46:33.478
The Saxons therefore know nothing
of the land?

46:35.840 --> 46:38.275
Frees-me.
I can save.

46:39.640 --> 46:40.517
Te release?

46:41.040 --> 46:43.794
He saved me from your blade.
Let me repay my debt.

46:45.400 --> 46:49.679
Where do you think I run away?
In these thieves?

46:55.600 --> 46:58.399
My people know this poison.
I can heal.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.233
By using witchcraft? No!

47:00.400 --> 47:05.156
From moss, bark, nettles...
You call this witchcraft?

47:21.160 --> 47:22.389
I can save.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.277
We have work to do.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.993
He will hallucinate.

49:13.160 --> 49:14.116
This mixture is close

49:14.280 --> 49:17.591
once that used to communicate with the first gods.

49:18.880 --> 49:20.473
The first gods?

49:21.080 --> 49:22.355
Demons!

49:24.520 --> 49:25.590
Maybe.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.436
But they were worshiped in these lands

49:29.600 --> 49:32.115
Long before we hear about
of Christ.

49:32.480 --> 49:37.077
We must fight these first gods
and all that they have created.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.792
They are a scourge.

49:56.680 --> 49:58.876
This will prevent the wound fester.

50:35.000 --> 50:35.638
Mange.

53:11.400 --> 53:15.872
Embodies my anger.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.069
All is well.

53:32.440 --> 53:33.715
I saw you.

53:34.880 --> 53:36.439
You were in my dreams.

53:38.520 --> 53:40.113
You saved me.

53:41.480 --> 53:43.472
I've only repay my debt.

53:45.640 --> 53:46.835
You do not have debt.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.320
It is I who have one.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.554
My ancestors used this poison.

54:01.400 --> 54:04.996
It opens a window on another world.

54:06.320 --> 54:09.074
Warriors of my people there had recourse

54:09.240 --> 54:12.312
to their power of the gods,
time of battle.

54:18.760 --> 54:20.956
I have seen horrible things.

54:26.480 --> 54:29.075
We live in a time of darkness.

54:36.600 --> 54:37.875
You're strong, boy.

54:39.560 --> 54:40.914
I do not feel well.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.554
The road is still long.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.878
Finish the rest.

54:49.880 --> 54:50.757
I know, yes.

54:52.160 --> 54:53.640
Pick me everything.

54:56.240 --> 54:57.594
We have to go.

55:10.200 --> 55:11.600
We have lost track of them.

55:16.160 --> 55:17.799
You can say goodbye to Thy Book, old man.

55:20.960 --> 55:23.634
The hatred of the old
has opened the door to death.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.117
His son was killed.

55:28.080 --> 55:30.914
It took us deep
Saxon lands.

55:31.600 --> 55:34.160
This man is crazy.
Should no longer obey him.

55:35.120 --> 55:36.110
Set out again!

55:38.320 --> 55:39.834
A word, traitor

55:40.000 --> 55:42.560
and your body will serve meals
crows.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.317
Go!

55:45.480 --> 55:47.199
We will find the book.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.672
My wrath will fall upon anyone
dare stand against me.

55:50.840 --> 55:53.355
Any mutiny is futile.

55:55.880 --> 55:58.520
Then you have us.
Or you will die.

56:00.160 --> 56:00.991
Go!

56:18.720 --> 56:20.359
We will rest for a few moments here.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.320
Let us rest.

56:23.040 --> 56:24.440
No. It should not.

56:31.560 --> 56:32.755
You need to rest.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.197
He will remain faithful to our old king.

56:50.000 --> 56:50.911
And you?

56:51.680 --> 56:53.160
I am you.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.118
This old man leads us right to death.

56:56.440 --> 56:58.477
We have no luck,
in open combat.

56:58.760 --> 57:00.319
I'll take care of them.

57:00.480 --> 57:03.439
A murder in the sight of all
would do you no honor.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.792
Opts instead for a good time.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.433
The wound festers.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.160
He refused my help.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.916
Survive he?

57:32.640 --> 57:34.393
Let him rest.

57:35.200 --> 57:38.159
I'll get
sheets to clean the wound.

57:39.720 --> 57:41.791
How is it that you know all this?

57:43.720 --> 57:47.031
My people use
benefits of nature for a long time.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.716
My mother taught me
what his mother had taught him.

57:54.280 --> 57:56.112
I'm sorry for your family...

58:00.200 --> 58:02.271
I find him in the other world.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.639
I, too, have lost mine.

58:12.720 --> 58:14.712
Parle-moi of them.

58:20.360 --> 58:22.431
They were not of my blood.

58:23.440 --> 58:25.716
But the monks raised me.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.194
I helped scribes.

58:29.480 --> 58:30.675
Scribes?

58:32.560 --> 58:36.349
The monks of Lindisfarne
devoted to the translation of the Scriptures.

58:37.200 --> 58:39.112
I heard of your books.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.151
They contain power and beauty.

58:43.720 --> 58:46.189
The holy pictures delight the world.

58:47.240 --> 58:48.799
Like these...

58:51.840 --> 58:56.278
They tell ancestral stories.
Before the birth of Christ.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.715
Stories should not be forgotten.

59:00.880 --> 59:02.837
These early kings?

59:05.960 --> 59:08.316
Christ is part of our history.

59:10.680 --> 59:15.232
They are beautiful.
Comparable to Scripture.

59:17.160 --> 59:18.913
The book is not all.

59:21.200 --> 59:25.877
But it is the word of God.
We must protect at all costs.

59:26.040 --> 59:28.794
And people?
Must we not protect them too?

59:29.360 --> 59:30.157
The Book protects.

59:31.240 --> 59:35.029
What? The plague?
From famine? Not.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.359
The Nordic destroyed our abbey.

59:39.960 --> 59:42.031
They are chasing Book
inland.

59:42.200 --> 59:43.600
But they never will.

59:45.920 --> 59:48.799
I swore to my master
I would put it in a safe place.

59:49.680 --> 59:52.400
On behalf of the Angles and of his kingdom,
I have to go through.

59:52.560 --> 59:55.473
We, the peoples of the North,
have also attacked the Picts.

59:55.640 --> 59:57.632
We fought.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.558
Against Nordiques?

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.350
Our warriors
protect the people and the Word by iron.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.515
My duty is to bring the Book
at Iona Abbey.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.230
Fail is not me.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.072
And once your accomplishment?

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.917
I have seen too many horrors
holed me to a monastery.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.550
What do you do?

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.195
Nothing that I know
survived.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.320
I have nothing.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:58.752
Flee!

01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.672
Flee!

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.232
Find him!

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.560
Where do you go like that?

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.476
It will be fun.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.876
The Power of Angles.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.869
Le Livre du white Christ.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.558
Do not you know how to read the words,
old?

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.515
Whatever. You got it, your trophy.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.795
I see its beauty, power...

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.278
I'm sorry.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.877
I'm sorry I doubted you.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.078
You'll be the king of this country.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:21.877
Let me kiss you, Hadrada Ekerö.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.788
So much blood has been spilled for these pages.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.832
I'll kill your wife and rape your daughters.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.956
As you raped my mother.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.957
No, you're not worthy to die
a sword.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:24.720
You never get to Valhalla.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.791
Hope that your white
Christ welcomes you into his heaven.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.991
I Hamal king Ekerö!

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.832
Longships to go back now.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.435
Too many men have fallen
because of his madness.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.596
That is fact.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.633
What wild beauty.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.320
And what courage.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.276
Attach it.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.477
It will be worth its weight in gold in our
brothels.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.552
- And the monk?
- Yes, what?

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.074
It will seek to recover the Book.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.995
A monk would not survive a whole day
in these mountains.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.231
Wolves take care of him.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.640
Where are they?

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.314
The girl is alive?

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.192
Why killing many men, demon?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.036
Why?

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.359
They were innocent.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.595
Innocents!

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.200
Forgive me!

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.031
What was he?

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.995
Nothing.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.478
This monk did not know Aim

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.398
It should not escape.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.192
Bitch!

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.237
You want to play, right?

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.315
I like to play, too!

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.437
Do not move.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.959
You will suffer before seeing your Christ.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.359
All this for a simple book?

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.517
How can it at this point
exercise much power over men?

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.154
As soon as it evokes
men are running amok!

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.833
But look at it!

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.834
The word of your god has no power!

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.072
Where is therefore thine god, now?

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.632
Hereward Lindisfarne.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.279
The brothers Lindisfarne
bear arms?

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.713
I am the last of the brothers.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.997
Here is the sacred book.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.799
It should anything happen to her.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.990
Would you be willing to stay with us?

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.796
This is impossible.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.911
God be with you, my brother.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.997
<i> I Hereward Northumbria </ i></i>

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.200
<i> I have no other name </ i></i>

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:33.793

<i> His icy stones,
my only refuge. </ i></i>

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.316
<i> This sacred island is my life </ i></i>

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:54.315
<i> Moult men perished in the Holy Book,
in these days of horror </ i>.</i>

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.920
<i>  I do not forget them in my prayers </ i></i>

01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.475
<i> Never </ i></i>

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.350
<i> This land has taught me so much,
after my life in the monastery </ i></i>

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.589
<i> I made my new refuge </ i></i>

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.434
<i> My life has resumed its contact </ i></i>

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.398
