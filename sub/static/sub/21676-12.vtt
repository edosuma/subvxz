34:18.999 --> 34:19.999
- I'm actually kind of bummed

34:19.999 --> 34:21.999
to be setting up
our last beach picnic.

34:21.999 --> 34:23.999
I love everything
I'm doing right now,

34:23.999 --> 34:24.999
and a beach picnic is nothing.

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
I'll do this
a thousand more times.

34:25.999 --> 34:28.999
- Oh, my God. This looks
like a real beach party.

34:28.999 --> 34:29.999
- Hi there, Vito.
- Hi.

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
- You doing okay?
- Yeah. Taking a little nap.

34:31.999 --> 34:33.999
- Good.
Yeah, chill out, relax.

34:33.999 --> 34:36.999
Everybody's doing the same.

34:36.999 --> 34:39.000
- Everybody relaxing?
- Just relaxing.

34:41.999 --> 34:43.999
- We're trying to get them

34:43.999 --> 34:45.999
pushed out for the beach,
'cause it's pretty rolly.

34:45.999 --> 34:47.999
A lot of them
are not feeling the anchorage.

34:47.999 --> 34:50.999
- All right, so Rocky's
going to stay on the boat.

34:50.999 --> 34:53.999
- I just need you to bring ice.
- Okay.

34:53.999 --> 34:55.999
- Check, check. We're ready,
if you need our guests off.

34:55.999 --> 34:56.999
- Hi, guys.
We'll head over to the beach.

34:56.999 --> 34:57.999
- Perfect.

34:57.999 --> 34:58.999
- You guys
can explore for a while,

34:58.999 --> 35:00.999
and we'll set up lunch.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.999
- Okay. I suck at life.

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
Yeah.

35:07.999 --> 35:09.999
- How are you doing?
- I don't even know.

35:09.999 --> 35:12.999
I'm already crazy,
and about to go, "Oh."

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
- Do you need someone
to stand up?

35:14.999 --> 35:15.999
I will go
and I will face up to him,

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
and I will say, "What the fááá
are you doing to her?"

35:17.999 --> 35:20.999
And if you need someone
to confront people,

35:20.999 --> 35:21.999
I will do that for you.
- No, I don't need that.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.999
- Rocky's my friend,

35:23.999 --> 35:26.999
and my friends
get my protection.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
- It's not even
about that anymore.

35:28.999 --> 35:30.999
It's basically my sháá.

35:30.999 --> 35:32.999
- Remember,
I'm here for you.

35:32.999 --> 35:33.999
[upbeat music]

35:33.999 --> 35:34.999
- Okay, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

35:34.999 --> 35:35.999
- Need a hand? All right.

35:35.999 --> 35:38.000
Gonna hold my hand too?
- Yeah.

35:38.999 --> 35:39.999
- Dave, Connie,
we're en route

35:39.999 --> 35:40.999
with some guests right now.

35:40.999 --> 35:42.999
- Roger that.
- Oh, you okay?

35:42.999 --> 35:45.999
- [laughs]

35:45.999 --> 35:46.999
- It's your first day?

35:46.999 --> 35:48.999
- Fricking Neanderthal.
- Watch out.

35:48.999 --> 35:50.999
- This is where we're coming
in here? This beach?

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
It's a little rocky.

35:56.999 --> 35:58.999
- I'm trying to figure out
some way

35:58.999 --> 36:00.999
to get in the water
today.

36:00.999 --> 36:01.999
Somehow.

36:01.999 --> 36:03.999
Water. what does it do?
Cools me down.

36:03.999 --> 36:06.999
Calm down.
Makes me feel good.

36:08.999 --> 36:11.999
- Absolutely amazing.
- This is beautiful.

36:11.999 --> 36:13.999
- Nice.
- This is gorgeous.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
- It's amazing.
- Oh, man, it feels like clay.

36:15.999 --> 36:16.999
- Yeah, it doesn't feel real.

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
- Can I get you guys
started on anything to drink?

36:18.999 --> 36:19.999
- A margarita.
- A margarita.

36:19.999 --> 36:20.999
- Some beer.
- I'll take a beer too.

36:20.999 --> 36:21.999
- Two beers.

36:21.999 --> 36:22.999
- Oh, they're individually
wrapped. Okay.

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
- Margarita for you.
- Thank you.

36:24.999 --> 36:26.000
- What kind of sandwiches
are they?

36:26.999 --> 36:27.999
- Lobster salad.
- Oh.

36:27.999 --> 36:28.999
- Oh, cool.

36:28.999 --> 36:29.999
- Beers definitely help
me get my bearings.

36:29.999 --> 36:31.999
- I've been on the bathroom
floor half the day today.

36:31.999 --> 36:32.999
- Cheers.

36:34.999 --> 36:37.999
- I know everybody
thinks I'm a horrible,

36:37.999 --> 36:39.999
you know,
unprofessional person.

36:39.999 --> 36:42.999
So might as well
put on my mermaid tail

36:42.999 --> 36:43.999
and go improve our tip.

36:43.999 --> 36:47.999
- You're a nutcase,
aren't you?

36:47.999 --> 36:50.999
What the hell is she doing?

36:50.999 --> 36:53.999
This is very odd.

36:53.999 --> 36:56.999
- Cute, huh?
- Oh, I see a mermaid.

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
- What?
- Wow.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.999
- There it goes.
Just dived. You guys missed it.

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
- I want to know how she's gonna
serve the guests in her tail.

37:11.999 --> 37:12.999
- Mm-hmm.

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
- How is everyone?
- Oh, good.

37:14.999 --> 37:15.999
They're just eating lunch.

37:15.999 --> 37:18.999
- Oh, dear, Rocky,
what are you doing?

37:18.999 --> 37:21.999
- What do you want to do now,
lay on the sand or something?

37:21.999 --> 37:22.999
- Do you want
me to carry you over there?

37:22.999 --> 37:24.999
- No.

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
- Okay.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.000
- [laughs]

37:33.999 --> 37:34.999
- Rocky's really trying

37:34.999 --> 37:36.999
to impress the guests
with her mermaid tail,

37:36.999 --> 37:38.999
but any time anything
with fins or a tail

37:38.999 --> 37:41.999
washes up onshore
and flops around,

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
it kind of
ruins your beach picnic,

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
'cause it's a little bit
sad and awkward.

37:44.999 --> 37:47.999
- Yeah, go. Ready.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
- I'm ready to go back
and bring some things with me.

37:49.999 --> 37:50.999
- Copy that.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.999
- I'm gonna just jump onboard,
and I'll hand it to you.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
- Great. Thank you.
- I assume you're coming?

37:57.999 --> 38:00.999
- I don't know.

38:00.999 --> 38:02.999
- What the fááá is she doing?

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
- Nothing. Ever.

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
- Rocky.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.999
- You coming with us?
- Sure.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.999
- All right.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.999
- Will you grab
her a towel, please?

38:13.999 --> 38:16.999
- Ready to go back?
- No, y'all don't have to leave.

38:16.999 --> 38:17.999
They're just taking
some of the things back.

38:17.999 --> 38:18.999
Who's ready for a shot?

38:20.999 --> 38:23.999
- One, two...
- There we go.

38:23.999 --> 38:24.999
You all right?
- Yeah.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
- Okay.

38:28.999 --> 38:30.999
- Eddie, Eddie,
the guests are ready

38:30.999 --> 38:32.000
to head back to the ship.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000

38:34.999 --> 38:35.999

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
I totally had a thing
with Eddie the whole time.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.999
- What?

39:36.999 --> 39:39.999
- What?

39:39.999 --> 39:41.999

one time in the restroom,

39:41.999 --> 39:42.999
and we kept it
under the wraps,

39:42.999 --> 39:43.999
and we were totally
under the radar.

39:43.999 --> 39:45.999
- No!
- Yep.

39:45.999 --> 39:47.999

39:51.999 --> 39:53.999
You know how you
and I were talking tonight?

- I am literally floored
because I can't believe that.

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
Did he break up
with his girlfriend?

39:59.999 --> 40:00.999
- He never
talked to me about that.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.999
- Wait. I cannot believe you're
telling me this right now.

40:03.999 --> 40:05.000
- So here it is.
Like, he kind of gives me,

40:05.999 --> 40:06.999
like, a look of like,

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
"Yo, what's up, girl?"

"This has got
to happen somehow.

- Like, there's so many people
in the boat.

40:13.999 --> 40:14.999
Like, how are we
gonna do this?

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
Where?
- Like, logistically--

40:16.999 --> 40:19.999
- Laundry room, that door
that, like, has the turn,

40:19.999 --> 40:21.999
and then you could hear the
people coming down the stairs,

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
because you could hear--
- Oh, my gosh. That's amazing.

40:23.999 --> 40:26.999
- No one was in
the crew area. So, like--

40:26.999 --> 40:28.999
- A laundry room is a hot place
to do it, too.

40:28.999 --> 40:29.999
- I know.
I've done some--

40:29.999 --> 40:31.999
- Great countertop in there.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
- It was, like, steamy.
Starch and steamy, dude.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
First time was amazing.
- Yeah?

40:35.999 --> 40:37.999

and I was just like,

40:37.999 --> 40:39.999
"Oh, my God."
- Right?

40:39.999 --> 40:40.999
- "I want to marry this guy."

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
- So you just, like,
slipped your skort over?

40:42.999 --> 40:45.999
- It was the--it was
the nighttime evening dress.

40:45.999 --> 40:48.999
- Oh, my gosh.

40:48.999 --> 40:51.999
- Anyways...
- I kind of hate you.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
Like, what?

40:53.999 --> 40:56.999
Like, this has,
A, happened, and, B,

40:56.999 --> 40:59.999
y'all have been able to keep
it a secret this entire time?

40:59.999 --> 41:01.999
Wow. That's impressive.

41:01.999 --> 41:02.999
- I actually,
like, really liked him.

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
- Right, 'cause he's--
what's not to like about him?

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
- He's awesome and amazing,
and then he's,

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
like, being mean to me.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
Eddie has, like, been,
like, a total assááá to me,

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
and so I kind of
wanted to talk to him,

41:11.999 --> 41:13.999
like, "Yo, we had
a really cool thing going,

41:13.999 --> 41:15.000
and you could've been cool,
but...

41:15.000 --> 41:16.999
you were kind of an ass."
- Right.

41:16.999 --> 41:17.999
"It didn't have
to end like that."

41:17.999 --> 41:19.000
- It didn't. It didn't.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.999
I just want to talk to Eddie,

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
but at the same time,
I don't know how to say it.

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
I'm like,
"Hey, like, you hurt me."

41:24.999 --> 41:25.999
The way he's been treating me

41:25.999 --> 41:28.999
makes me feel
like he has a chick.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.999
- You know, he does.
He has a girlfriend.

41:30.999 --> 41:31.999
[knock at door]

41:31.999 --> 41:33.000

41:33.000 --> 41:34.999
- Come on in.

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
- Does she know?
- Yeah.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.999
- Okay. Do you want
me to approach him for you?

41:38.999 --> 41:39.999
- No.
- No.

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
- I don't want you to have
to talk to him.

41:41.999 --> 41:42.999
I came to you 'cause
I was just like--

41:43.000 --> 41:45.999
- I want to talk to him.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--

41:45.999 --> 41:46.999
- Let Rocky handle it.
Let Rocky handle it.

41:46.999 --> 41:48.999
- Wait, wait--

41:48.999 --> 41:51.999
bro, this is my little thing.
Like, I can handle it.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
- Give her the respect
and let her handle her business.

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
- Because this is my business.
- It's not something

41:55.999 --> 41:56.999
that everyone
needs to talk about.

41:56.999 --> 41:57.999
Everyone needs to know.

41:57.999 --> 41:59.999
The last thing
I want to happen

41:59.999 --> 42:01.999
is for Emile to go down
and confront Eddie about it.

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
I could see, like, a physical
fight coming out of it.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.999
- Honestly, though, I cannot
look at him the same way.

42:06.999 --> 42:07.999
- Really?
- I cannot.

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
He's not my friend,

42:09.999 --> 42:10.999
and he has been
treating you like sháá.

42:10.999 --> 42:12.999
I think someone
like that is dishonest,

42:12.999 --> 42:15.999
and I think someone like that
needs to be called out.

42:15.999 --> 42:17.999
- No. Emile,
you've got to let her--

42:17.999 --> 42:19.000
- No, you're not leaving.
Ow.

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
Oh, my God,
I blew it by talking to him.

42:24.999 --> 42:25.999
Fááá, fááá, fááá, fááá,
fááá, fááá, fááá,

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000

42:27.999 --> 42:28.999
- Next time,

42:28.999 --> 42:29.999
on the season
finale of "Below Deck"...

42:29.999 --> 42:30.999
- Rocky is talking about

42:30.999 --> 42:32.999
docking up.
- What?

42:32.999 --> 42:34.999
Rocky,
are you gonna unlock the door?

42:34.999 --> 42:35.999
You're saying that something
happened between us?

42:37.999 --> 42:40.999
- Nothing ever happened.
- This guy is a coward.

42:40.999 --> 42:41.999
- Eddie and Emile.

42:41.999 --> 42:43.999
One for the back
and one for the front.

42:43.999 --> 42:45.999
A six-some.

42:45.999 --> 42:46.999
- We love you for being
such a good sport.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
- Have a seat.
- Am I in trouble?

42:48.999 --> 42:50.999
- You know,
you could construe it as that.

42:52.999 --> 42:55.999
- Ah! Ow!

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
- Anchors home
for the last time.

42:56.999 --> 42:59.999
- Copy that.
- Charter season, over!

42:59.999 --> 43:00.999
both: Ahh!

43:00.999 --> 43:01.999
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:01.999 --> 43:04.999
- Yay.
- To the future.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.999
- I think you're
a fáááing assáááá.

43:05.999 --> 43:07.999
- Really? Why?
- You wanna put this all on me?

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
Who initiated this?
- You did.

43:09.999 --> 43:10.999
The way you, like,
lifted your black skirt up,

43:10.999 --> 43:13.999
and you had nothing underneath.
- Oh, my God.

43:13.999 --> 43:16.999
