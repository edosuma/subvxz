WEBVTT

00:02.201 --> 00:03.921
<i>This is Captain Hoffman.</i>

00:04.241 --> 00:05.601
Reporting for duty, Commander.

00:05.801 --> 00:08.641
Allow me to introduce Criminal Inspector
Forster from the Gestapo.

00:08.881 --> 00:12.441
Your log book. This is where
your heroic story will be recorded.

00:13.921 --> 00:16.441
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

00:16.761 --> 00:18.281
- You're French?
- No. German.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.601
<i>They say you're sailing tomorrow.</i>

00:20.921 --> 00:23.161
I have to go.
If not, I'll be court-martialed.

00:23.521 --> 00:26.521
<i>Shortly before 10:00 p. m., a woman</i>
<i>will show up. Give her that.</i>

00:26.721 --> 00:28.601
I am supposed to give you something.
From Frank.

00:28.681 --> 00:30.041
He sent me. I'm his sister.

00:30.121 --> 00:31.641
You've got something for me?

00:32.521 --> 00:34.241
You've got something for me!
Give it to me!

00:34.401 --> 00:35.401
<i>Police!</i>

00:37.601 --> 00:38.921
<i>Out there we 're on our own.</i>

00:39.081 --> 00:43.121
There's only one way we will prevail.
Together!

00:44.721 --> 00:47.361
- Take her out, First Watch Officer.
- Harbor stations!

00:49.841 --> 00:52.721
- Would you come with me, please?
- Why?

01:05.961 --> 01:10.001
The woman got caught with this
on her last night. Black market morphine.

01:12.321 --> 01:14.361
First question: Is she buying or selling?

01:15.961 --> 01:17.361
Please translate my question.

01:20.201 --> 01:22.401
The morphine. Are you buying or selling?

01:30.521 --> 01:34.161
Second question:
Small bottle, small offense.

01:34.241 --> 01:36.961
Why shoot a police officer because
of something so trivial?

01:37.081 --> 01:38.641
And where did she get the gun from?

01:39.761 --> 01:42.561
Why did you shoot a police officer?
Where did you get the gun from?

01:47.881 --> 01:51.561
Duval's certain that there
was someone else present. A woman.

01:52.281 --> 01:53.841
Ask her, who else was there.

02:00.361 --> 02:02.921
You've been seen with someone.

02:03.881 --> 02:05.041
Who was this?

02:13.881 --> 02:15.361
Ask her again.

02:22.201 --> 02:23.801
Who was this?

02:29.361 --> 02:33.521
You got me into deep shit.
You fucked everything up!

02:37.881 --> 02:38.881
What did she say?

02:42.841 --> 02:43.921
They'll be coming!

02:44.321 --> 02:46.001
Until they have what they want!

02:47.081 --> 02:47.961
Bitch!

02:48.961 --> 02:49.881
Excuse me, please.

03:06.001 --> 03:07.281
Are you alright, Miss Strasser?

03:11.441 --> 03:12.361
What did she say?

03:13.001 --> 03:15.601
Viendront... that's a declination
of venir... to come?

03:19.041 --> 03:20.441
They'll be coming... until they...

03:21.841 --> 03:23.361
have what they want.

03:24.961 --> 03:25.881
Really?

03:26.241 --> 03:29.841
The morphine, did she have it on her
when she got arrested?

03:30.441 --> 03:31.321
Why?

03:32.401 --> 03:34.041
Because I'd like to understand.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.041
She bought it from somebody
or she was trying to sell it.

03:38.161 --> 03:40.081
That's at least what Duval thinks.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.721
We'll find out. There's always a trail.
And she'll talk.

03:45.321 --> 03:46.321
You think?

03:46.841 --> 03:48.521
No. I know.

05:35.961 --> 05:36.801
Sir.

05:36.881 --> 05:38.001
Any radio messages?

05:38.401 --> 05:39.841
Not yet, Sir.

05:40.561 --> 05:43.241
I hope you had enough time
to say good-bye to your sister?

05:45.281 --> 05:46.161
Good.

05:46.801 --> 05:48.001
Well...

05:54.281 --> 05:55.321
Gentlemen!

05:55.961 --> 05:57.201
Strelitz, position?

05:57.841 --> 06:00.961
210 miles north-east of La Coruna.
Course two-eight-zero.

06:01.001 --> 06:02.361
Still nothing from Lorient?

06:05.601 --> 06:06.881
Time for another drill.

06:08.081 --> 06:11.281
Corvette, zero three five,
two thousand four hundred yards,

06:11.401 --> 06:12.681
angle-on-the-bow, port two zero.

06:12.961 --> 06:15.161
Sir, with all due respect,
the men have...

06:15.241 --> 06:16.961
Speed 18 knots.

06:17.001 --> 06:17.881
Target course?

06:17.961 --> 06:19.601
One-five-five, Sir.

06:19.721 --> 06:21.801
Course recommendation
for counter-attack two-five-three.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.081
Make ready tubes one and two.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.081
<i>Make ready tubes one and two.</i>

06:25.801 --> 06:26.921
Not again!

06:27.201 --> 06:28.601
Come on, assholes! Get up!

06:28.961 --> 06:31.201
Put the bunks away, hurry up!

06:31.281 --> 06:32.841
Get going, you lazy bastards.

06:32.961 --> 06:33.881
Rig ship for dive, Chief!

06:33.961 --> 06:34.961
Rig ship for dive!

06:35.041 --> 06:35.961
Rig ship for dive!

06:41.561 --> 06:44.401
Flood tubes one and two. Go, go, go!

06:44.521 --> 06:45.321
Matthias, let's go!

06:48.281 --> 06:49.121
Coming down.

06:49.761 --> 06:50.841
Go, go, go, go!

06:51.961 --> 06:53.561
- Conning tower hatch closed.
- Rig buoyancy vents.

06:53.641 --> 06:54.521
Aft buoyancy vent rigged.

06:54.601 --> 06:55.801
Both central buoyancy vents rigged.

06:55.881 --> 06:56.921
All buoyancy vents rigged.

06:56.961 --> 06:57.841
Cycle the vents.

07:03.801 --> 07:05.161
- Number one tube flooded.
- Good!

07:05.241 --> 07:06.441
Number two tube flooded!

07:06.561 --> 07:08.241
Open the outer doors on tubes one and two.

07:11.961 --> 07:13.881
The ninth drill in 10 hours!

07:13.961 --> 07:15.641
One can't expect to be able
to do something in war

07:15.721 --> 07:16.961
that one hasn't learnt in peacetime!

07:17.081 --> 07:18.921
What the fuck are you talking about?

07:19.441 --> 07:21.321
- Forget it.
- Shut the fuck up then.

07:23.121 --> 07:24.321
Outer door number two tube is open!

07:24.401 --> 07:25.881
Outer door number one tube is open!

07:26.161 --> 07:27.001
Good!

07:27.081 --> 07:28.441
Tubes one, two ready.

07:30.001 --> 07:31.841
Prepare one torpedo for reloading.

07:32.081 --> 07:33.241
Best time so far?

07:33.761 --> 07:34.601
Four minutes 20, Sir.

07:34.681 --> 07:36.001
We can do better, right?

07:37.761 --> 07:39.001
Periscope depth!

07:39.161 --> 07:41.641
Fifteen degrees down on the bow planes.
Zero degrees on the stern planes.

07:41.881 --> 07:43.401
Prepare one torpedo for reloading.

07:43.761 --> 07:47.201
Fuck! For the third time! Let's show
the old sweat! Come on, let's go!

07:50.001 --> 07:51.441
Okay, now lift it!

07:51.561 --> 07:53.761
Pull! Pull!

07:53.921 --> 07:55.601
Let's do something different, gentlemen.

07:57.001 --> 07:58.961
Fifteen degrees down
on the bow planes and keep it!

07:59.401 --> 08:01.881
Müller,
keep bow planes 15 degrees down!

08:02.241 --> 08:03.561
Chief, hold periscope depth!

08:07.441 --> 08:09.241
Bow planes jamming 15 degrees down!

08:09.441 --> 08:13.121
E-engines half speed, blow cell five!
All hands astern!

08:13.241 --> 08:15.001
All hands astern!

08:18.641 --> 08:19.721
Faster, faster, faster!

08:20.241 --> 08:21.121
Go, go, go!

08:21.201 --> 08:23.521
Come on! Faster, you bloody slowcoaches!

08:25.801 --> 08:27.441
What the heck are they doing now?

08:28.201 --> 08:29.761
- What's the time?
- I don't know!

08:29.841 --> 08:31.321
I bet we make it below four!

08:31.401 --> 08:32.921
Just to show this slave driver!

08:33.361 --> 08:34.441
I'm fine with below 4:20!

08:34.561 --> 08:36.161
Below four!
Crate of beer in the next harbor!

08:36.241 --> 08:37.241
Bet's on!

08:38.761 --> 08:43.201
Damn it! Pull it back!
Go! Back down, front up!

08:50.961 --> 08:52.001
We're too deep!

08:52.241 --> 08:53.281
One meter up!

08:53.361 --> 08:54.921
Twenty degrees up on the stern planes.

08:57.241 --> 08:58.601
Stay calm, Müller.

08:59.521 --> 09:00.361
Stay calm.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.801
Boat has been oscillated.

09:15.441 --> 09:17.441
She's dancing on tiptoes,
like a ballerina!

09:19.521 --> 09:21.241
Come on. Matthias, let's go.

09:23.241 --> 09:24.081
Secure it!

09:24.441 --> 09:25.281
Secured!

09:25.601 --> 09:26.401
- Secured!
- Secured!

09:26.841 --> 09:28.761
The torpedo is, but the CO isn't!

09:29.921 --> 09:31.161
<i>Torpedo ready to reload, Sir.</i>

09:32.841 --> 09:34.081
3:58, gentlemen.

09:34.201 --> 09:35.161
Well done, Müller.

09:36.041 --> 09:38.161
- Sir.
- You all did a good job.

09:38.241 --> 09:40.081
God damn it, that was hard work!

09:41.441 --> 09:44.121
You should not take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain! Asshole!

09:44.881 --> 09:46.241
You owe me a crate of beer.

09:48.601 --> 09:50.321
Take it down again.

09:51.001 --> 09:52.081
Rig for surface.

09:52.561 --> 09:53.441
Sir?

09:54.001 --> 09:55.321
Radio message from Lorient!

10:11.841 --> 10:14.961
Proceed to naval square
Bruno Fritz seven one!

10:16.081 --> 10:18.761
Report our position naval square
Bruno Fritz five eight

10:18.841 --> 10:19.721
to submarine command.

10:19.801 --> 10:20.881
Aye, Sir.

10:24.441 --> 10:26.321
Time required until reaching
the theater of operations?

10:30.921 --> 10:32.561
Twelve hours at full speed, Sir.

10:32.961 --> 10:34.601
Enough time for some more drills.

10:44.441 --> 10:47.561
The purpose of a drill is
to test the men under pressure.

10:48.921 --> 10:50.441
Without pressure, there's no test.

10:51.321 --> 10:52.241
But I think that...

10:53.081 --> 10:54.201
you know this, First Watch Officer.

10:54.401 --> 10:55.241
Right?

11:02.441 --> 11:04.001
Gentlemen,
this is the Captain speaking.

11:04.601 --> 11:08.281
We are going on intercept course
to an Allied Convoy heading south-west.

11:08.361 --> 11:09.201
Yeah!

11:09.281 --> 11:10.961
<i>I repeat: We 're going on intercept course.</i>

11:11.001 --> 11:11.961
Full speed ahead.

11:12.161 --> 11:13.281
Full speed ahead.

11:15.401 --> 11:16.801
You'll take over, First Watch Officer.

11:26.001 --> 11:27.001
Well.

11:27.961 --> 11:29.761
Maybe he's like his father after all.

11:31.241 --> 11:34.041
His father was a Captain,
not a slave driver.

11:36.001 --> 11:38.361
We'll find out soon enough
how he is under pressure.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.361
What are you doing here, Emile?

14:19.361 --> 14:22.361
Wrong question.
What is she doing in prison?

14:23.441 --> 14:24.281
Who?

14:25.001 --> 14:27.241
Who? Jacqueline.

14:30.801 --> 14:32.121
Somebody tipped the police off.

14:33.201 --> 14:34.161
The church...

14:35.441 --> 14:36.961
only we knew about it...

14:37.761 --> 14:39.161
the U-boat man...

14:39.521 --> 14:40.321
and you.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.001
Nobody else.

14:43.601 --> 14:44.601
He must have talked.

14:45.161 --> 14:46.321
Frank Strasser?

14:48.561 --> 14:50.441
They certainly found the morphine on her.

14:53.281 --> 14:56.241
What do you think? How long will it take
the Germans to find out about you?

14:57.441 --> 14:58.561
She stole it.

15:00.081 --> 15:02.441
- No idea, how. It's as simple as that.
- I need more.

15:03.561 --> 15:05.281
- Everything you got.
- No.

15:05.601 --> 15:07.521
Tell Miss Monroe it's over.

15:08.801 --> 15:09.841
No more morphine.

15:11.801 --> 15:13.401
And now get out of my office.

15:16.681 --> 15:19.041
The patient in room 17,
you have to change...

15:57.961 --> 15:58.921
Hello.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.001
Hello.

16:11.841 --> 16:14.001
- Who are you?
- My name is Simone.

16:15.121 --> 16:16.361
I'm his sister.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.801
What's your name?

16:20.001 --> 16:21.281
Nathalie.

16:21.441 --> 16:22.401
You two are together?

16:24.841 --> 16:25.841
He didn't tell me.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.081
Where is Frank?

16:28.161 --> 16:31.881
Gone to sea. He had no choice.
Orders.

16:34.001 --> 16:39.041
Last night he sent me to meet a woman.
To make an exchange.

16:39.841 --> 16:41.001
I don't understand why.

16:41.561 --> 16:42.801
Please, leave.

16:43.241 --> 16:44.961
I think it's about morphine.

16:45.761 --> 16:48.241
- Is Frank an addict?
- Leave! Please!

16:48.521 --> 16:51.201
You have to help me!
I need to understand.

16:51.521 --> 16:53.041
- Yes, please?
- Are you the new girl?

16:53.121 --> 16:54.961
- Frank is in danger.
- New girl?

16:55.401 --> 16:56.441
What can I get you, mister?

16:56.881 --> 16:58.721
- You have to help me...
- Will you join me in my room?

16:58.841 --> 17:00.961
- Darling, what's going on here?
- You've got great lips.

17:01.081 --> 17:02.441
Leave me alone!

17:02.561 --> 17:03.841
What's wrong with you?

17:03.921 --> 17:06.041
- Come with me to the room.
- She's mine!

17:07.561 --> 17:09.161
French slut!

17:51.761 --> 17:53.161
Monsieur Duval?

19:17.521 --> 19:19.001
That's all I could get.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.361
What if she talks?

19:25.401 --> 19:27.241
She will talk at some point. Even her.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.841
You can leave. But Luc, Marc,
Claude and me... our families are here.

20:28.801 --> 20:31.161
Still not talking.

20:33.281 --> 20:35.881
Tell us about the morphine
and it all stops.

20:50.961 --> 20:54.841
You're not a drug addict either.
No needle marks...

21:10.641 --> 21:12.241
International Brigades?

22:09.561 --> 22:11.201
Scream and you're dead!

22:11.881 --> 22:12.961
Not one word!

22:13.321 --> 22:14.201
Sit down!

26:05.441 --> 26:06.841
Commander!

26:07.361 --> 26:12.361
Sorry for interrupting your morning walk,
but your presence is required.

26:12.681 --> 26:14.361
Top secret orders from Berlin.

26:26.561 --> 26:27.881
Good morning, Miss Strasser.

26:32.281 --> 26:33.321
Good morning.

26:33.921 --> 26:35.841
That was a rather unfortunate situation.

26:36.361 --> 26:39.161
The prisoner was more forthright
than I'd expected.

26:40.001 --> 26:41.361
She's a communist.

26:41.961 --> 26:43.121
What? A communist?

26:43.241 --> 26:45.561
It's unlikely she acted alone.
But whoever helped her,

26:45.921 --> 26:48.121
I'll hunt them down.

26:48.601 --> 26:51.601
It's my job to protect La Rochelle
from these elements.

26:52.241 --> 26:55.001
These are the people we're at war with.
They are enemies of the Reich.

26:55.921 --> 26:58.961
But they'll pay with their lives.
Rest assured.

27:02.001 --> 27:03.841
Is there something else bothering you?

27:05.001 --> 27:07.001
Is it because of your brother? Frank?

27:08.361 --> 27:10.961
You'd just arrived when he was ordered
to sail out. Of course...

27:11.681 --> 27:13.041
that's not easy for you.

27:14.401 --> 27:18.161
My brother,
my brother means a lot to me...

27:18.321 --> 27:19.521
Criminal Inspector Forster...

27:19.761 --> 27:21.441
Commander Gluck will see you now.

27:21.961 --> 27:22.961
I'm coming.

27:25.601 --> 27:26.921
You'll excuse me?

27:33.161 --> 27:34.201
A secret mission?

27:34.561 --> 27:36.761
Yes, a secret non-combat mission.

27:37.201 --> 27:38.961
This comes directly from Goebbels' office.

27:39.521 --> 27:42.401
They only need me for assigning a boat
to this mission.

27:42.721 --> 27:43.561
Propaganda?

27:44.001 --> 27:48.401
That's why you're here. A political
decision requires a political mind.

27:48.641 --> 27:53.961
No offense. Our duty should be
to sink Allied ships.

27:54.241 --> 27:58.961
Starving out a nation
of 60 million requires every single boat.

28:00.801 --> 28:03.401
Here's the list of operational boats
we could send.

28:21.201 --> 28:23.121
What about U-612?

28:25.041 --> 28:26.081
Hoffmann?

28:27.441 --> 28:28.961
Why him?

28:30.241 --> 28:33.441
Well, Hoffmann has low combat experience.
You could spare him the most.

28:35.001 --> 28:36.401
Think about his prestige.

28:36.961 --> 28:39.561
If Goebbels wants something,
it has to be big.

28:40.241 --> 28:42.201
And what could be better propaganda

28:42.281 --> 28:44.161
than the son of a hero
becoming a hero himself?

28:45.401 --> 28:48.081
If he succeeds you'll be
in the spotlight too. If he fails...

28:48.601 --> 28:50.401
he'll be the one to blame, not you.

28:52.321 --> 28:54.241
That's what I call a political mind.

28:57.921 --> 28:59.241
Quite a beast.

29:01.041 --> 29:02.561
Do you see any escorts?

29:03.841 --> 29:04.881
Destroyers?

29:07.921 --> 29:08.921
No.

29:09.921 --> 29:11.241
No escorts at the flanks.

29:12.241 --> 29:13.521
Nothing.

29:17.041 --> 29:18.081
Strange.

29:21.841 --> 29:24.521
- How big is our pack?
- Apart from us, another five.

29:30.961 --> 29:32.161
Damn bright.

29:49.841 --> 29:52.001
Make ready tubes one
to four for surface firing.

29:54.281 --> 29:56.841
<i>Make ready tubes one</i>
<i>to four for surface firing.</i>

29:57.041 --> 29:59.201
Finally. Let's go, boys.
Flood tubes one to four.

30:02.161 --> 30:03.881
- Tubes one and three flooded.
- Good.

30:04.001 --> 30:04.961
Tubes two and four flooded.

30:05.001 --> 30:07.241
Right. Open the outer doors
on tubes one to four.

30:24.441 --> 30:26.721
Tubes number one to four ready
for surface firing.

30:31.441 --> 30:33.281
Come to port to three-five-zero.

30:33.841 --> 30:36.001
Full speed ahead. Attack starts.

30:36.361 --> 30:39.001
Come to port to three-five-zero.
Full speed ahead.

30:57.561 --> 30:59.201
Radio message from submarine command.

31:04.201 --> 31:06.241
Watch closely. Next turn is yours.

31:11.921 --> 31:15.921
Torpedo speed 30. Enemy speed 16.
Angle-on-the-bow,

31:16.401 --> 31:19.241
starboard 90.
Distance twelve hundred meters.

31:21.321 --> 31:22.841
Fire one! Fire two!

31:23.361 --> 31:24.721
Fire one! Fire two!

31:24.801 --> 31:25.761
Fire!

31:32.841 --> 31:34.321
Isn't this easy?

31:34.801 --> 31:35.841
Easy?

31:36.201 --> 31:39.841
It's not easy, it's the reward
for all the bloody hard work!

31:40.041 --> 31:43.361
A nice salute to our enemies from our
comrades lying on the bottom of the sea.

31:43.881 --> 31:45.961
Corvette at two six zero degrees!

31:49.201 --> 31:51.521
Alarm! Dive, dive, dive!

31:51.601 --> 31:52.401
Alarm!

31:53.281 --> 31:55.201
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:55.281 --> 32:01.601
- All hands forward. Move it!
- Go, go, go, go.

32:02.841 --> 32:04.161
Faster, faster.

32:04.761 --> 32:06.401
Watch where you're going, asshole.

32:07.001 --> 32:09.601
Conning tower hatch closed.
Take her down. 50 meters.

32:23.601 --> 32:24.761
What about the torpedoes?

32:25.001 --> 32:25.921
Just wait.

32:34.241 --> 32:40.921
Torpedo one: 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

32:46.401 --> 32:47.401
Missed target.

32:51.041 --> 32:54.761
Torpedo two: 53, 54.

32:56.921 --> 32:57.801
A dud.

33:02.001 --> 33:03.801
Fuck! A dud!

33:03.881 --> 33:05.961
Reload! Let's go!

33:06.001 --> 33:07.721
Don't you want to wait for further orders?

33:07.801 --> 33:09.361
Shut up, we'll show these bastards.

33:09.681 --> 33:11.721
Pull it over here.
Close outer doors on tubes one to four.

33:16.361 --> 33:17.401
Sir.

33:18.201 --> 33:19.801
Radio message from submarine command.

33:20.401 --> 33:21.881
Received it before the alarm.

33:28.041 --> 33:29.281
We've got new orders.

33:30.961 --> 33:33.601
New coordinates and a narrow time frame
to get there.

33:34.361 --> 33:35.681
And an additional order saying:

33:36.961 --> 33:38.201
Avoid combat.

33:43.961 --> 33:45.121
Abort attack!

33:46.241 --> 33:47.081
What?

33:47.881 --> 33:49.281
Tell the men to stand down.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.721
We are attacking as a wolf pack.

33:51.041 --> 33:52.961
Five of our boats are out there.
They're counting on us.

33:53.081 --> 33:54.441
Tell the men to stand down!

34:02.161 --> 34:03.281
Aye, Sir.

34:09.081 --> 34:10.321
Take her down. Eight zero meters.

34:10.401 --> 34:11.441
Release safety.

34:11.681 --> 34:12.561
Tube one closed.

34:12.721 --> 34:13.681
Tube two closed.

34:13.761 --> 34:15.841
Too far.

34:15.921 --> 34:17.161
Safety released.

34:19.961 --> 34:21.401
Stand down!

34:23.201 --> 34:24.321
Have they lost it?

34:24.401 --> 34:26.001
Coitus interruptus.

34:26.521 --> 34:29.841
You think that's funny? Huh?
You think that's funny?

34:30.361 --> 34:31.441
Asshole!

34:31.561 --> 34:33.001
Shit!

35:23.281 --> 35:25.161
You don't have a choice anyway.

36:16.361 --> 36:17.921
Homesick?

36:26.001 --> 36:26.881
Who is that?

36:29.241 --> 36:31.561
My husband. Raymond.

36:39.201 --> 36:40.361
Dunkirk.

36:43.841 --> 36:45.081
Sorry.

36:52.881 --> 36:55.001
Let's hope that this won't happen
to your brother.

37:11.001 --> 37:12.401
What about you? Are you married?

37:13.041 --> 37:14.161
Divorced.

37:15.401 --> 37:18.801
The new laws in Germany made it easier.

37:20.361 --> 37:22.961
If you feel so German, why are you here?

37:23.761 --> 37:25.961
Why not in Berlin? Or Frankfurt?

37:27.841 --> 37:29.841
Because I'm just a French woman there.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.961
And here you're just a German woman?

37:39.601 --> 37:41.041
Maybe not even that.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.241
Never heard of such a thing.

37:45.441 --> 37:47.361
Abort an attack with the target
under our noses.

37:47.441 --> 37:49.281
It's like sitting on the shitter
and not having a dump.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.841
New orders. Nothing you can do.

37:52.321 --> 37:55.521
You know what we are now?
A boat of coward faggots.

37:59.561 --> 38:01.001
Where are we headed to now?

38:01.881 --> 38:05.881
Tails: we head straight into a convoy.
Like a wolf into a flock of sheep.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.401
Heads: we win the war.

38:20.721 --> 38:22.761
Tempting fate is bad luck, asshole!

38:34.841 --> 38:36.241
What's up, snitch?

38:36.761 --> 38:37.681
I'm no snitch.

38:37.761 --> 38:39.121
Don't believe you, Frenchman!

38:39.201 --> 38:40.041
Everything okay, boys?

38:41.201 --> 38:42.201
Aye, Sir.

38:45.201 --> 38:46.201
Sir.

38:50.001 --> 38:51.841
Hey, I need to take a dump.

38:57.601 --> 38:59.081
- You too?
- Yes.

39:00.001 --> 39:02.561
I had a friend, navigator on U-75,

39:02.801 --> 39:06.121
who told me what a total bastard
they had for a Captain.

39:06.201 --> 39:09.961
Once he made them do thirty drills
in one day.

39:10.041 --> 39:12.201
Nobody dared to go to the toilet.

39:12.281 --> 39:14.921
What a shitty situation... literally!

39:20.201 --> 39:21.281
What's that?

39:22.001 --> 39:23.001
Dried meat.

39:23.841 --> 39:25.441
A specialty from home.

39:26.561 --> 39:28.201
May I?

39:35.841 --> 39:37.001
Not bad, right?

39:38.201 --> 39:39.241
But don't tell anyone.

39:47.561 --> 39:48.761
Do you know...

39:49.281 --> 39:51.961
the difference between a pantry
and a pussy?

39:52.281 --> 39:53.281
Nope.

39:53.361 --> 39:56.121
The pantry doesn't smack when
you take out the sausage.

40:37.161 --> 40:41.561
Do Not Fear the Depth by
Captain (retired) Wilhelm Hoffmann.

40:50.601 --> 40:51.841
Who told you that?

40:53.321 --> 40:55.001
The driver of the Chief of Flotilla.

40:56.401 --> 40:58.161
Hoffmann shot him himself?

40:58.961 --> 41:00.881
He didn't wait for the firing squad?

41:00.961 --> 41:03.081
Just a rumor. You don't want
to believe everything you hear.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.881
I'd believe it straight away.

41:04.961 --> 41:08.601
That's how the world is.
Them in the front, and us back here.

41:13.521 --> 41:15.801
Cowardice in the face of the enemy.
That was apparently the reason.

41:18.041 --> 41:20.401
Well then, Hoffmann should
have shot himself a long time ago.

41:27.401 --> 41:28.841
Why us?

41:32.921 --> 41:34.961
They can't just pull us out
of an ongoing battle.

41:36.281 --> 41:38.801
The other U-boats... it's just not right.

41:39.521 --> 41:41.801
It's our duty to support our comrades.

41:45.361 --> 41:47.841
My duty is to obey orders.

41:52.001 --> 41:54.601
With all due respect
one can pretend not to hear.

41:54.681 --> 41:56.561
And then listen
to what Lorient has to say later.

41:57.921 --> 41:59.761
- Shit, sorry.
- Damn it, Müller!

41:59.841 --> 42:00.761
Sorry!

42:04.321 --> 42:07.001
Remember Kretschmer, Schepke and Prien?

42:07.321 --> 42:08.241
Prien.

42:09.041 --> 42:10.321
The bull of Scapa Flow.

42:11.201 --> 42:12.201
He was a real hero!

42:13.601 --> 42:16.561
The three bet on who could sink
the most tonnage on their next tour.

42:17.401 --> 42:19.521
A bit of healthy competition
between the Grey Wolves.

42:20.521 --> 42:22.841
That's the sort of thing people love
to read about back home, right?

42:24.561 --> 42:26.081
But where were they six weeks later?

42:28.081 --> 42:30.401
Kretschmer captured,
Prien and Schepke both dead.

42:31.401 --> 42:33.721
I don't really understand
what you are trying to tell me, Sir.

42:34.321 --> 42:36.201
If they wouldn't have played the hero...

42:37.281 --> 42:38.721
they'd still be alive.

42:41.081 --> 42:43.321
Gentlemen: cheers!

42:44.161 --> 42:45.121
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

42:54.561 --> 42:57.841
If everyone just does
what he feels like, we'll lose the war.

42:58.561 --> 43:00.961
We'll get our chance. Just not right now.

43:02.001 --> 43:02.921
Gentlemen...

43:04.401 --> 43:05.801
to the things to come.

43:06.561 --> 43:07.761
To the things to come.

43:43.161 --> 43:45.081
Chief on bridge!

43:57.521 --> 43:58.681
How are the engines running?

43:59.441 --> 44:00.961
Great so far.

44:02.241 --> 44:05.081
In fact, I should give daily lectures
to these men about

44:05.161 --> 44:07.921
what a miracle a VIIC U-boat is,
from a technical point of view.

44:08.441 --> 44:10.321
The Second Watch Officer tells me
you helped design it.

44:11.321 --> 44:13.041
'35-'38.

44:14.801 --> 44:16.601
Designed parts of the diving plane.

44:17.841 --> 44:19.401
Then you know each and every screw.

44:20.201 --> 44:22.121
We'll certainly need your knowledge
at some point.

44:24.681 --> 44:25.801
Do you have any children?

44:30.801 --> 44:31.841
A son.

44:33.241 --> 44:34.841
He'd be nine years old now.

44:41.041 --> 44:44.321
He and my wife died in an air raid
on Kiel last year. They were burnt alive.

44:47.041 --> 44:48.121
I'm sorry.

44:59.801 --> 45:01.961
The crew and you, it will sort itself out.

45:04.921 --> 45:06.441
They just need a bit of time.

47:28.521 --> 47:30.641
- Christ!
- Shit.

47:31.841 --> 47:37.401
Always choosing the right time,
bloody Brits. Hurry!

47:37.961 --> 47:39.321
Let's get out of here.

47:39.641 --> 47:42.841
Come with me to my shelter room,
maybe we can find a dark corner there.

49:29.441 --> 49:30.721
Jacqueline.

49:32.561 --> 49:33.761
Jacqueline.

49:34.321 --> 49:35.241
Jacqueline.

49:37.121 --> 49:38.361
Carla sent me.

49:42.081 --> 49:43.001
Jacqueline.

49:43.961 --> 49:47.361
Carla sent me.

50:09.161 --> 50:10.201
Take this.

50:11.841 --> 50:13.281
Take it. That's for you. From Carla.

50:13.361 --> 50:15.961
For you. You've got to do it.

50:16.401 --> 50:17.241
Come on.

50:17.321 --> 50:18.161
Jacqueline.

50:18.441 --> 50:19.841
I can't.

50:20.081 --> 50:20.961
What?

50:22.201 --> 50:23.681
I can't do it.

50:24.041 --> 50:25.961
Yes, you can! I--

50:27.241 --> 50:28.201
You have to!

50:28.761 --> 50:29.681
You do it.

50:29.761 --> 50:30.601
What?

50:31.401 --> 50:32.521
You do it!

50:32.601 --> 50:34.841
Take it. Come on!

50:35.521 --> 50:36.321
You do it.

50:36.401 --> 50:41.601
Take it. Come on! I can't do it! I can't.
I don't know how to do this.

50:41.681 --> 50:43.001
I don't know what to do!

50:43.961 --> 50:45.361
What?

50:46.201 --> 50:49.201
Look. Here.

50:50.041 --> 50:50.921
Shit.

50:54.761 --> 50:55.761
Here.

50:57.001 --> 50:57.881
There?

50:57.961 --> 50:58.841
Yes.

51:23.361 --> 51:24.201
Jacqueline.

51:28.961 --> 51:29.801
Jacqueline.

52:28.401 --> 52:29.281
Whiskey.

52:30.961 --> 52:31.801
Oscar.

52:33.601 --> 52:34.561
Tango.

52:36.401 --> 52:37.441
Alfa.

52:39.921 --> 52:40.921
November.

52:41.401 --> 52:42.241
WOTAN.

52:42.321 --> 52:43.361
That's our contact.

52:43.801 --> 52:45.961
We've been running the engines hard.
More diesel wouldn't hurt.

52:46.201 --> 52:47.361
Alright.

52:48.441 --> 52:49.801
Gigl, you'll take over for Müller.

52:50.801 --> 52:53.201
Müller, get a jacket.
You'll take care of the refueling.

52:54.441 --> 52:56.001
A bit of fresh air would do you some good.

52:56.121 --> 52:57.121
Aye, Sir.

52:58.841 --> 52:59.921
Upwards!

53:48.081 --> 53:49.241
We're good to go!

53:51.961 --> 53:53.561
You're in command, First Watch Officer.

54:12.041 --> 54:13.361
Your mission is highly classified.

54:14.121 --> 54:16.081
You are to travel to these coordinates
within five days.

54:18.881 --> 54:21.161
You will liaise with a vessel
and effect an exchange.

54:21.961 --> 54:23.921
Any details have to be kept secret
from the crew

54:24.201 --> 54:26.361
except where operationally necessary.

54:26.961 --> 54:29.441
There will be no mention of it in your
log book or in any subsequent reports.

54:29.561 --> 54:32.161
You will not engage with the enemy unless
the success of your mission is at risk.

54:32.321 --> 54:33.441
Understood?

54:34.361 --> 54:36.161
I'd like to know what I am exchanging.

54:41.601 --> 54:43.281
It's about this man.

54:44.201 --> 54:46.081
Mr. Samuel Greenwood.

54:47.241 --> 54:48.401
Take him aboard.

54:59.401 --> 55:03.561
Two U-boats are missing. The scout U-boat
and another one from the wolf pack Ozelot.

55:03.961 --> 55:05.001
Now you're off the hook.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.561
And nothing but a passenger steamer
for just one guest.

55:08.321 --> 55:09.761
Probably best for everyone.

55:14.041 --> 55:15.161
Take him inside.

55:15.401 --> 55:17.001
Plane at two o'clock!

55:18.041 --> 55:19.121
Plane!

55:21.201 --> 55:22.441
Stop refueling!

55:22.561 --> 55:24.081
Cut hose pipes.

55:24.201 --> 55:25.361
Alarm!

55:25.641 --> 55:27.681
- Alarm!
- On your stations!

55:27.801 --> 55:28.961
Alarm!

55:29.241 --> 55:30.841
Shit. Come on. Hurry!

55:31.561 --> 55:32.361
Fuck.

55:32.681 --> 55:36.241
Helmsmen to the control room! Now!

55:36.401 --> 55:39.001
Come on, faster! Go, go, go!

55:39.441 --> 55:40.321
Come on, move!

55:40.401 --> 55:43.001
Take him to the Officers' Mess
and watch him.

55:43.121 --> 55:45.801
Go, go, go! Faster, faster!

55:45.961 --> 55:47.961
Come on! Hurry up!

55:48.321 --> 55:49.321
Alarm!

55:52.561 --> 55:53.961
Come on, men!

55:54.041 --> 55:56.841
Let's go. Move!

55:59.361 --> 56:00.321
Alarm!

56:00.841 --> 56:01.801
Cast off!

56:02.961 --> 56:03.801
Faster!

56:03.881 --> 56:04.761
Hurry up, Willy.

56:05.561 --> 56:06.601
Go, go, go, go.

56:11.281 --> 56:14.161
Man overboard! Man overboard!

56:14.241 --> 56:17.961
Take the rope! Take the rope!

56:18.041 --> 56:20.761
Got him! I need help!

56:20.841 --> 56:22.041
Pull! Pull!

56:30.401 --> 56:31.761
Got him!

56:32.841 --> 56:33.921
Be careful!

56:33.961 --> 56:36.001
Watch out!

56:37.201 --> 56:38.841
Take his legs.

56:48.921 --> 56:50.161
Got him.

56:51.041 --> 56:52.281
Give us a hand!

56:52.361 --> 56:53.281
Be careful!

56:57.121 --> 56:58.641
Be careful!

57:00.761 --> 57:02.721
Conning tower hatch closed.
Rig buoyancy vents.

57:02.961 --> 57:05.161
Rig buoyancy vents.
