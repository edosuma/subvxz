10:09.012 --> 10:10.496
She's a pit bull.

10:10.514 --> 10:14.850
Ugh, Eileen, we have lost
so much for this show.

10:14.885 --> 10:16.702
Do you ever wonder
if it's worth it?

10:16.737 --> 10:19.138
Every day.

10:19.172 --> 10:22.808
I lost my house,
I lost my money,

10:22.843 --> 10:24.794
I lost Nick.

10:24.828 --> 10:26.345
[Door opens]

10:26.363 --> 10:27.630
Hello.

10:27.664 --> 10:30.516
I thought
you'd like to know,

10:30.534 --> 10:33.569
I fixed the situation
with Patrick Dillon.

10:33.620 --> 10:35.721
[Clears throat]
I found out where he lives

10:35.756 --> 10:38.708
and sent over
a very nice bottle of wine

10:38.742 --> 10:40.526
and a lovely
little apology note.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.479
Oh, Tom.
You have to cancel that order.

10:43.513 --> 10:44.747
What are you talking
about?

10:44.798 --> 10:46.799
There are strict rules
about giving gifts

10:46.833 --> 10:49.118
to members
of the nominating committee.

10:49.152 --> 10:52.471
Thisthis wasn't a gift.
It was a bottle of wine,

10:52.506 --> 10:55.174
a petite syrah, at that.
In some circles,

10:55.208 --> 10:58.010
they don't consider that
a gift at all.

10:58.045 --> 10:59.879
Let's hope
he sees it that way.

10:59.913 --> 11:01.998
He could use it to sanction you
or, worse still,

11:02.032 --> 11:06.185
disqualify you
from the awards.

11:06.219 --> 11:10.806
Well, um, maybe I can try
and cancel the order.

11:10.841 --> 11:13.859
Yes, I hope
it's not too late.

11:19.683 --> 11:21.033
[Door thuds]
Ah.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.838
[Sighs]

11:29.426 --> 11:32.328
You need
to leave the show.

11:32.362 --> 11:35.181
Health issue, family emergency,
I don't care what.

11:35.215 --> 11:37.416
Bow out now,
Ana gets her role back,

11:37.451 --> 11:39.035
and this doesn't have to get
any uglier.

11:39.069 --> 11:40.586
[Chuckles]

11:40.604 --> 11:43.222
Oh. Oh, you feel good
about yourself?

11:43.256 --> 11:45.057
About how you got
this job?

11:45.091 --> 11:47.476
- How did you get this job?
- I worked my ass off.

11:47.527 --> 11:49.228
I found the composer,
and I created the role,

11:49.262 --> 11:50.362
and I didn't sleep
with the director

11:50.397 --> 11:51.480
and then blackmail him.

11:51.531 --> 11:53.251
No, you did everything
but sleep with him.

11:53.266 --> 11:56.769
You played the game too.
Look, Karen,

11:56.787 --> 12:00.939
unlike you, I have been trying
to get here for ten years.

12:00.957 --> 12:03.793
Ten years of lost roles,
endless showcases,

12:03.827 --> 12:06.629
teaching pilates,
all the while knowing

12:06.663 --> 12:10.082
I was just as good if not better
than everyone around me.

12:10.117 --> 12:14.370
After two years of that,
let alone ten, you stop caring

12:14.404 --> 12:16.505
about being a good person.
You do what it takes.

12:16.556 --> 12:19.742
You know who else
has been here a long time,

12:19.776 --> 12:22.311
paying her dues?
Ana.

12:22.345 --> 12:24.063
And now
she's completely screwed.

12:24.097 --> 12:25.314
She can't even get
a real audition.

12:25.348 --> 12:27.183
I'm sorry about that.

12:27.217 --> 12:29.902
I am, but that's not my fault,
it's Derek's.

12:29.936 --> 12:31.353
All I did was say yes.

12:31.404 --> 12:32.521
And that was your choice.

12:32.572 --> 12:35.591
You can choose another one,
the right one.

12:35.625 --> 12:40.913
I won an award today.
I'm not leaving.

12:45.268 --> 12:48.254
Yeah.
[Coughs]

12:48.288 --> 12:51.340
Uh, k-Karen totally deserved
her win today.

12:51.374 --> 12:53.676
We're... we're very lucky
to have her.

12:53.710 --> 12:56.212
Leaving <i>Bombshell</i>
<i>and taking a risk with your show</i>

12:56.263 --> 12:57.379
was a good move,
it seems.

12:57.430 --> 12:59.498
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd say so.

12:59.516 --> 13:02.968
I mean, with <i>Bombshell,</i>
<i>she was just imitating an icon,</i>

13:03.002 --> 13:06.305
and here she actually, you know,
created a real character.

13:06.339 --> 13:08.190
"Imitating an icon."

13:08.225 --> 13:10.008
Is that what you think
Ivy Lynn is doing?

13:10.026 --> 13:11.861
Well, I mean,
I'm just saying

13:11.895 --> 13:13.863
that a lot of actresses
have played Marilyn,

13:13.897 --> 13:15.397
and Karen
is the first Amanda.

13:15.448 --> 13:17.128
Hey, can we get back
to talking about Kyle?

13:17.150 --> 13:19.568
Karen! We were just
talking about you.

13:19.619 --> 13:20.736
Hey, hi.

13:20.787 --> 13:23.989
Yeah, and Kyle...
Kyle, uh... [laughs]

13:24.023 --> 13:26.358
I asked you to do this interview
so that people would know

13:26.376 --> 13:27.793
that <i>Hit List</i> wouldn't exist
without him.

13:27.828 --> 13:32.081
Oh, what about Julia Houston?
How does she fit in all this?

13:32.132 --> 13:33.749
I'm so... I'm sorry,
what do you mean?

13:33.783 --> 13:36.552
There's a lot of talk about
how close she and Kyle were.

13:36.586 --> 13:40.139
People are assuming she did
a lot of work on this show.

13:40.173 --> 13:42.091
- Excuse me?
- Oh, let me clear this up,

13:42.142 --> 13:43.208
if that's okay.

13:43.226 --> 13:45.261
<i>Hit List</i>
is Kyle's vision.

13:45.312 --> 13:48.063
It all started with him.

13:48.098 --> 13:51.650
It's the statement
he left to the world.

13:51.685 --> 13:53.686
And Julia's a friend of mine,
she's a friend to our show,

13:53.720 --> 13:56.405
we love her,
but whatever you're hearing,

13:56.439 --> 13:57.990
it just... it isn't true.

13:58.024 --> 14:00.776
Off the record,
someone should tell her

14:00.827 --> 14:03.195
to stop speaking about Kyle
so much.

14:03.229 --> 14:04.509
It's giving
the wrong impression.

14:04.531 --> 14:06.615
- Oh, we will. We...
- Thanks for your time.

14:06.666 --> 14:09.668
- Thanks.
- Certainly will.

14:11.705 --> 14:14.006
I cannot believe t
she is sabotaging our show.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.926
Jimmy, she's not.
You're so wound up.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.711
She loved Kyle, that's why
she's talking about him.

14:18.745 --> 14:21.213
Besides, she had
her own dramaturge on <i>Bombshell,</i>

14:21.248 --> 14:23.215
this guy Peter Gilman.

14:23.249 --> 14:25.250
She's sensitive
to keeping a script doctor

14:25.268 --> 14:26.635
behind the scenes.

14:26.686 --> 14:29.221
Hmm.

14:31.608 --> 14:33.609

That's a delivery
for Mr. Dillon.

14:52.579 --> 14:55.297
Yes, I'm the one
who sent it.

14:55.332 --> 14:58.918
That's... that's my name
on the card.

14:58.952 --> 15:01.320
There's been a mistake.
I need to take it back.

15:01.354 --> 15:03.055
He's on his way down
right now to get it.

15:03.089 --> 15:05.007
You can explain it to him
yourself.

15:05.058 --> 15:07.843
That won't be necessary.

15:07.894 --> 15:09.645
- Do I need to call the police?
- Oh. No.

15:09.679 --> 15:10.813
[Paper tears]

15:10.847 --> 15:13.098
Chintzy.
Hey, man, what's going on?

15:13.132 --> 15:15.818
It's nothing.

15:15.852 --> 15:18.070
Hi again. Um,

15:18.104 --> 15:21.740
I got you this bottle of wine
to apologize...

15:21.775 --> 15:24.026
[Whispering] If I could just...
Thank you.

15:24.077 --> 15:25.995
Not knowing
that was against the rules.

15:26.029 --> 15:27.579
So I was taking it back,

15:27.614 --> 15:30.366
and I was hoping that you
wouldn't even know about it.

15:30.417 --> 15:33.002
A petite syrah,
that's your apology?

15:33.036 --> 15:37.039
[Chuckles]
Um...

15:40.794 --> 15:42.344
What are you doing?

15:42.379 --> 15:44.930
Just let me take it back, and
we'll forget the whole thing.

15:44.965 --> 15:46.765
- No, let go.
- No.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.017
- You're...
- This is insane.

15:48.051 --> 15:49.334
Please let go of the bottle.
Please let go of...

15:49.352 --> 15:50.853
- [Grunts] You... just...
- You're very strong.

15:50.887 --> 15:53.055
- Stop it! I know I'm strong.
- Please let go of the bottle!

15:53.106 --> 15:55.975
You don't understand!
Gimme it!

15:56.009 --> 16:00.095
Oh... my... God.

16:00.130 --> 16:03.148
Please tell me
those are J. crew.

16:04.818 --> 16:06.351
I don't know
what's happened to me.

16:06.369 --> 16:10.205
I'm usually
so calm and collected.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.291
I... send me... send me
the dry cleaning bill.

16:12.325 --> 16:13.325
- I'll pay for it.
- Tom!

16:13.326 --> 16:14.743
No, please. Please.

16:14.794 --> 16:19.465
Tom, you've done enough.
Now, please, leave me alone.

16:19.499 --> 16:21.967
Enjoy your outer critics
circle award,

16:22.002 --> 16:25.137
in case it's the only one
you get.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.542
[Sighs]

16:36.766 --> 16:38.767
You got it?

16:40.487 --> 16:42.154
Okay, so why are you
really here?

16:42.188 --> 16:44.490
My show lets out before yours,
and I wanted to see my friend.

16:44.524 --> 16:45.557
Is there anything wrong
with that?

16:45.575 --> 16:46.575
- Hmm.
- Ivy!

16:46.576 --> 16:47.693
[Cheering]
Ivy, over here!

16:47.727 --> 16:49.161
Hi.
[Laughs]

16:49.195 --> 16:51.280
I can't believe <i>Hit List</i>
won all those awards.

16:51.331 --> 16:55.117
Your show
is so much better.

16:55.168 --> 16:56.618
- Sorry. [Laughs]
- It's okay.

16:56.669 --> 16:58.120
[Laughter]
Thank you.

16:58.171 --> 16:59.401
Seriously, Sam, what's up?

16:59.427 --> 17:02.240
Listen, if you're having problems,
you need to talk to me.

17:02.258 --> 17:03.342
Problems?
What problems?

17:03.376 --> 17:05.077
Karen should not have
beaten you.

17:05.095 --> 17:06.962
Oh, <i>Hit List</i>
is a wonderful show,

17:07.012 --> 17:08.763
and Karen's wonderful
in it.

17:08.798 --> 17:09.848
[Laughter]
Hi.

17:09.883 --> 17:11.884
Everybody is worried
about you.

17:11.917 --> 17:14.053
Worried about me, why?

17:14.087 --> 17:15.554
Did you hear
what Karen and Jimmy

17:15.588 --> 17:17.890
- said about you in <i>The Voice?</i>
- No, what did they say?

17:17.924 --> 17:19.525
- She doesn't need to hear that.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:19.559 --> 17:22.394
Your performance is the furthest
thing from an imitation.

17:22.428 --> 17:24.646
An imitation?
Is that what Karen said?

17:24.696 --> 17:26.565
Yeah, and that <i>Bombshell</i>
isn't original.

17:26.598 --> 17:29.151
Listen, the only reason
<i>Hit List</i> even made it

17:29.202 --> 17:31.103
to Broadway is because
Kyle Bishop died. [Laughs]

17:31.121 --> 17:33.455
All: [Gasp]

Thank you
for coming in so fast.

I needed this call today.

19:04.952 --> 19:05.952
[Laughs]

19:06.003 --> 19:08.071
What's your life like
right now?

19:08.089 --> 19:09.472
Can you go on tour?

19:09.507 --> 19:12.125
I am wide open.
And I love <i>once.</i>

19:12.176 --> 19:13.960
I'm so honored
to be considered.

19:14.011 --> 19:16.913
You were even better
than Derek said you were.

19:16.931 --> 19:19.299
Derek Wills?

19:19.350 --> 19:23.353
He recommended you,
pushed pretty hard too.

19:24.889 --> 19:28.141
This is why...

19:28.192 --> 19:29.593
You've been acting so nuts.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.729
You're pregnant.

19:32.763 --> 19:38.235
So are we sure
that it's Derek's?

19:38.269 --> 19:42.038
Unfortunately, I narrowed
it down from a list of one.

19:42.073 --> 19:44.774
When are you telling him?

19:47.962 --> 19:51.748
You're not telling him.

19:51.782 --> 19:55.635
We're not even together.

19:55.670 --> 19:57.888
We didn't plan it, we didn't
even want it to happen.

19:57.922 --> 20:01.174
Hey, Ivy, he has a right
to know he's a father.

20:01.225 --> 20:04.244
Right now,
he's just a guy I slept with.

20:04.278 --> 20:07.397
I'll decide if he's going
to be the father.

20:10.067 --> 20:14.304
Sam, do you think
I could be a good mom?

20:16.123 --> 20:21.027
You are a great friend,
and it usually translates.

20:23.147 --> 20:26.533
I'm just such a mess
right now.

20:26.584 --> 20:29.035
And of course,
right when my career takes off,

20:29.086 --> 20:32.756
this has to happen.
[Sighs]

20:32.790 --> 20:37.627
Classic Ivy.
Absolutely worst timing ever.

20:37.661 --> 20:42.132
Listen, Ivy, you have
got to discuss this with Derek,

20:42.166 --> 20:47.921
no matter what you decide to do.
I know he's not always easy,

20:47.955 --> 20:50.974
but he cares about you.

20:54.278 --> 20:56.396
Why is Ivy here?

20:56.447 --> 20:58.615
She's the last person
I wanted to see today.

20:58.649 --> 21:01.651
I know. Thank you.

21:03.871 --> 21:07.624
- What can I get you?
- Just water.

21:09.126 --> 21:11.461
I feel like I'm going to be
stoned to death.

21:11.495 --> 21:13.997
I know I shouldn't
say this,

21:14.031 --> 21:17.033
but I thought <i>Hit List</i>
<i>was way overrated too.</i>

32:53.965 --> 32:57.301
Okay.

32:57.319 --> 33:00.437
I'm sorry
how everything worked out.

33:00.471 --> 33:02.990
That's the thing,
I don't think you are.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.475
Otherwise, you wouldn't
keep doing this again and again.

33:05.493 --> 33:07.027
You know, the only way
you would have stopped

33:07.078 --> 33:10.080
is if I would have exposed you
for who you really are,

33:10.115 --> 33:13.984
and that's what's really hard
for me to live with.

33:14.019 --> 33:16.320
Yeah, well, it's hard for me
to live with too.

33:16.338 --> 33:18.672
I'm sure you'll be just fine.
You've had a lot of practice.

33:18.707 --> 33:21.675
Come on, let's go.

33:30.001 --> 33:32.219
Oh, great.
[Sighs]

33:32.270 --> 33:34.555
What, are you up next,
are you?

33:34.606 --> 33:38.309
Come on, then.
Start kicking.

33:38.343 --> 33:40.861
I came to tell you
something important,

33:40.895 --> 33:44.514
but I'm actually glad
they got to you first.

33:44.532 --> 33:47.017
What have I done now?

33:47.035 --> 33:50.654
Uh, Ivy, no, wait.
Listen, let me explain.

33:50.688 --> 33:52.656
I've heard enough.

33:52.690 --> 33:55.025
You've never done
the right thing, Derek,

33:55.043 --> 33:58.045
and you never will.

34:14.601 --> 34:17.418
We did everything possible
to blow these nominations.

34:17.451 --> 34:18.702
I take solace in that.

34:18.753 --> 34:21.388
We didn't go halfway,
it's true.

34:21.422 --> 34:22.656
[Knocking at door]

34:22.690 --> 34:26.458
It's open!
Hurry up, it's coming on.

34:26.493 --> 34:28.494
I brought scones.

34:28.512 --> 34:31.047
And scotch,
in case things go badly.

34:31.098 --> 34:33.166
I don't even know
why I'm watching these.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.751
I'd understand
if you didn't.

34:34.784 --> 34:37.971
[Sighs]
No, I'm pulling for the show,

34:38.005 --> 34:39.172
and for you.

34:39.190 --> 34:40.190
[Knocking at door]

34:40.190 --> 34:42.192
Can you get that?

34:45.228 --> 34:46.780
Oh, hi.

34:46.813 --> 34:48.447
I was hoping you guys
wouldn't mind some company.

34:48.482 --> 34:50.766
Oh, no, of course.
Come in.

34:52.853 --> 34:56.072
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, they're on!

34:56.123 --> 34:58.291

35:16.344 --> 35:18.178
[Phone ringing]
Of course, that's her.

35:18.212 --> 35:20.430
She probably wants me
to withdraw.

Hi, mom.

Of course.
Just the icing on the cake.

35:28.322 --> 35:30.607
No, this is not over.
I'm getting you that part back.

35:30.658 --> 35:33.944

And Derek Wills,
<i>Hit List.</i>

36:53.640 --> 36:56.076
And on a historical note,
Derek Wills is only

36:56.110 --> 36:58.528
the second person
in Tony history

36:58.579 --> 37:01.531
to be nominated for three awards
in the same year.

37:01.582 --> 37:03.083

37:03.117 --> 37:04.150

Wait, that was four,
there's five.

37:42.623 --> 37:45.625
- It's alphabetical.
- That's it, I didn't get it.

Wonderful!
How many for <i>Hit List?</i>

38:09.733 --> 38:12.485
13, but that doesn't
mean anything.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.070
That's just one more
than us.

38:14.105 --> 38:15.822
Well, it'll be
the only one they get.

38:15.856 --> 38:20.160
[Tapping]
Oh, can I call you back?

38:20.194 --> 38:22.278
Sorry you came all this way,
Ms. Rand.

38:22.329 --> 38:24.730
- Nick Felder's no longer here.
- What do you mean?

38:24.748 --> 38:26.899
He was released
three weeks ago.

38:26.917 --> 38:29.902
He's out?

38:34.741 --> 38:36.209
[Sighs]

38:40.747 --> 38:44.417
Well, I'm gonna go
in the other room and...

38:44.435 --> 38:47.937
Eavesdrop.
[Chuckles]

38:58.566 --> 39:00.366
Hey, what you did for me
last night...

39:00.401 --> 39:03.653
That's okay.
You already thanked me.

39:03.704 --> 39:05.989
No, no, that's not
what I'm trying to do.

39:06.040 --> 39:09.359
I owe you
an explanation.

39:09.393 --> 39:14.347
I know that I pushed you away
after Kyle died.

39:14.381 --> 39:16.850
I know.

39:16.884 --> 39:19.785
And I think maybe you think
that it was because

39:19.803 --> 39:23.223
that I was mad about you
and Derek, but I wasn't.

39:23.257 --> 39:29.229
I just was afraid to let
someone else get close to me.

39:29.263 --> 39:33.566
And so I just thought it better
to let you go.

39:33.601 --> 39:37.053
I'm sorry.

39:37.087 --> 39:40.190
Uh, you know,
seeing the show last night

39:40.224 --> 39:42.659
did something else too.

39:42.693 --> 39:47.197
It made me realize
it could live on without me.

39:47.248 --> 39:49.983
- What do you mean?
- I mean that it was still great

39:50.017 --> 39:52.402
even with my understudy,

39:52.436 --> 39:54.654
and it would be great
without you too.

39:54.672 --> 39:58.124
The show stands for itself.
Mmhmm.

39:58.158 --> 39:59.992
Are you going somewhere?

40:00.010 --> 40:01.711
[Laughs]

40:01.762 --> 40:03.379
No, no, I just...

40:03.430 --> 40:07.467
Just thinking
about the future.

40:07.501 --> 40:12.338
Kind of nice knowing that
you're leaving something behind,

40:12.356 --> 40:16.059
no matter what.

40:16.110 --> 40:19.862
Thank you so much.
Have a good one.

40:28.689 --> 40:29.689
[Phone ringing]

40:29.690 --> 40:32.024
It's Frank.

40:32.042 --> 40:34.193
[Phone ringing]

40:34.211 --> 40:36.462
Maybe he's come around
about mediation.

40:36.497 --> 40:38.331
[Phone ringing]

40:38.365 --> 40:39.532
Hello?

40:39.550 --> 40:41.751
- I can't believe you did this.
- Did what?

40:41.802 --> 40:44.704
Hire Eileen Rand's
attorney.

40:44.722 --> 40:47.340
Look,
I was angry the other day,

40:47.374 --> 40:49.008
but I was still considering
my options.

40:49.042 --> 40:50.760
This makes things
so much easier.

40:50.811 --> 40:54.046
- No, no, Frank, I was just...
- Declaring war?

40:54.064 --> 40:55.715
You're the one
who had the affair.

40:55.733 --> 40:58.318
It happened. Julia,
this isn't a no-fault divorce.

40:58.352 --> 41:00.820
It is your fault,
and you are gonna pay for it,

41:00.854 --> 41:03.856
and I am gonna take you
for everything you're worth!

41:08.929 --> 41:10.896
Three nominations today.

41:10.914 --> 41:12.665
You are the hottest director
on Broadway.

41:12.700 --> 41:14.917
- Mm.
- What a year of vindication

41:14.952 --> 41:18.004
for you for those allegations
last fall.

41:18.038 --> 41:20.473
Anything you want to say?

41:20.507 --> 41:24.761
Well, as my good friend
Ronnie Moore always says,

41:24.795 --> 41:27.913
the work is the only thing
that matters.

41:27.931 --> 41:32.352
Doesn't matter if it's Broadway
or a black box at the Fringe.

41:32.386 --> 41:36.539
If you stick to that rule,
you'll probably be okay.

41:36.573 --> 41:39.192
Well, I guess we were
all wrong about you.

41:39.226 --> 41:41.577
Mm.

41:41.612 --> 41:46.149
What is it?

41:46.183 --> 41:49.986
Uh...

41:50.037 --> 41:52.705
Actually, you weren't.

42:04.117 --> 42:08.087
Uh, I promised Daisy Parker

42:08.121 --> 42:10.089
the role of the diva
in <i>Hit List</i>

42:10.124 --> 42:14.761
if she would sleep with me.

42:14.795 --> 42:19.599
She made good,
and so did I.

42:19.633 --> 42:22.435
Ana Vargas
was collateral damage.

42:22.469 --> 42:27.290
And wrongfully terminated.

42:27.324 --> 42:30.343
I'm sorry.

I don't think I want
to hear this right now.

Karen, she was just
lying there, not moving,

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.948
and instead of telling anyone,
I ran.

01:19:23.999 --> 01:19:26.567

changed my name.

see my future anymore.

Why are you telling me this
right now?

01:19:34.559 --> 01:19:38.979

every day...
