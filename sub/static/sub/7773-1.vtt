23:44.673 --> 23:45.549
(TIMER BEEPS)

23:51.555 --> 23:52.681
Your parents
aren't here,
are they?

23:52.723 --> 23:54.474
No.

23:54.516 --> 23:58.979
My hours are between 4:30
and 6:30 before they get
back from work.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.774
Any musical requests?

24:01.815 --> 24:04.902
The right tune creates
the right vibe. Coldplay?

24:06.237 --> 24:10.283
50 Cent? Dido?
Inner Relaxation Mix?

24:11.200 --> 24:14.620
Whatever. You choose.

24:17.915 --> 24:21.501
(TRUE PLAYING)

24:21.543 --> 24:25.923
Now, what kind of
experience do you
have?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.258
Oh, loads.

24:31.469 --> 24:34.181
You have to be completely
honest so I can evaluate
you accurately.

24:34.223 --> 24:38.727
(SIGHS) Okay, I
guess I practice a lot
on the back of my hand.

24:38.769 --> 24:43.441
On average a person will have
over 26,000 snogs in their
lifetime.

24:43.481 --> 24:47.194
So close your eyes,
relax, feel the magic.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.447
We're going to do
a standard one first.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.328
Wow, you're a natural.

24:56.287 --> 24:58.164
Really?

24:58.205 --> 25:01.667
Not too firm or toothy.
That's very common
with beginners.

25:01.708 --> 25:02.960
Great.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.297
Next, movement.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.966
When I
move my head in
you go the other way.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.717
The boy leads and
the girl always
fits in.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.180
Where should
I put my hands?

25:14.221 --> 25:17.599
The waist is safest.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.649
You're a quick learner.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.777
Now, tongues.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.365
They're a health
and safety issue.

25:32.406 --> 25:37.411
The secret is to
strike the right balance
between yielding and giving.

25:37.453 --> 25:40.664
Start slowly,
like a turtle,
not a lizard.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.833
Avoid washing
machine syndrome.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.261
(SONG CHANGES)

25:59.599 --> 26:02.395
(SONG CHANGES)

26:07.400 --> 26:08.275
(TIMER BEEPS)

26:10.277 --> 26:13.947
Sadly,
this session's over.
My next client's here.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.201
Hi, Georgia.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.536
Hi, El.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.540
Thank you, Georgia.
I'll be in touch.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.127
(GIRLS GIGGLING)

26:27.169 --> 26:30.923
You did tongues, didn't you?
Number six.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.842
You did a big fat
tongue sandwich,
didn't you?

26:33.884 --> 26:38.805
Oh, my God.
All I know is,
he was from Saliva City.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.391
(GROANING)

26:40.433 --> 26:43.436
But who cares?
I'm a snogging sensation.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.524
(SHRIEKING EXCITEDLY)

26:57.283 --> 26:58.700
ROSIE: Wait!

26:59.243 --> 27:02.496
Mum? Dad?

27:02.538 --> 27:06.833
I just want you both to know
how much I really appreciate
all you've done for me.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.377
I mean,
it can't be easy since

27:08.419 --> 27:11.464
you can hardly
remember being my age
'cause it was so long ago.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.673
Have you
been inhaling fumes
from the science lab?

27:13.715 --> 27:14.592
(CHUCKLES)

27:17.344 --> 27:19.597
I want to talk party details.

27:19.637 --> 27:22.640
Oh, Georgia. I told you
I needed to talk about
something important.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.560
Oh, this is important!

27:24.602 --> 27:26.644
Oh, all right! You go first.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.190
Can I invite boys?

27:30.232 --> 27:32.818
You haven't got some fancy
fellow we don't know about,
have you?

27:32.859 --> 27:38.532
No. Honestly, Dad. No
one says "fella" anymore.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.994
This isn't
the Middle Ages, you know.
Or the '70s as you call it.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.997
(SIGHS)

27:45.038 --> 27:47.749
Sorry, Dad.
I must be hormonal.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.045
Can I have a D.J.?

27:52.087 --> 27:54.423
Why would we pay for one when
we've already got one in the
family?

27:54.465 --> 27:56.550
What?
Oh, yes.

27:56.592 --> 28:01.514
No way.
Oh, I want music
from this century, Dad.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.849
If we hire a club,
we'll get a D.J.
thrown in.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.185
We
are not going
to hire a club.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.728
I can get
a very good rate
at the community hall.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.648
We've thrown some
legendary bashes
there.

28:10.688 --> 28:12.983
We still know
how to get down.

28:14.901 --> 28:15.653
(GROANS DISGUSTEDLY)

28:17.655 --> 28:20.740
Hey, wait, missy.
I haven't told you my news.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.787
Okay, just please stop
snogging. It's not normal.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.834
I have been
offered a promotion.

28:30.876 --> 28:35.964
Oh, cool.
Maybe I can get a PDA
instead of a mobile now?

28:36.006 --> 28:40.469
Georgia, where in the
world do you find the most
geomagnetic thermal activity?

28:41.345 --> 28:42.638
I don't know, Dad.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.847
New Zealand.

28:45.849 --> 28:49.978
That's the slight catch.
The job's in New Zealand.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.899
What?
Look, I know it's a big deal

28:53.940 --> 28:56.402
and I don't have to
decide anything yet.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.070
I really
want to discuss
it with all the family.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.779
CONNIE: It's a bit
of a shock for us all

28:59.821 --> 29:03.200
but
your dad's not going to do
anything we're not happy with.

29:03.242 --> 29:08.581
Oh, Dad, you
should totally go.
What an opportunity.

29:08.622 --> 29:12.585
GEORGIA:
Yes. One less
parent to deal with.

29:12.626 --> 29:15.795
If Dad goes to New Zealand
I can easily get around Mum

29:15.837 --> 29:18.840
and have my dream party.

29:18.882 --> 29:23.470
Now, I just need
a plan to show Robbie
I'm a natural born snogger.

29:23.512 --> 29:27.766
So, I've
figured out what I've got
that Slaggy Lindsay doesn't.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.102
Hair
on the back
of your legs?

29:30.143 --> 29:32.312
The Angus advantage.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.897
What?

29:33.939 --> 29:36.567
Robbie
loves cats
and so do I.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.818
So,
when he finds out
Angus is missing...

29:38.860 --> 29:39.945
But Angus isn't missing.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.072
Don't be dim.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.700
We just pretend
Angus is missing

29:44.742 --> 29:47.202
so I get Robbie
to help me find him.

29:47.244 --> 29:50.623
He'll discover
how unfake I am...
Ah!

29:50.664 --> 29:54.376
...and then
I'll try out my new natural
snogging technique and  voila!

29:54.418 --> 29:57.630
I've got my sex god.
Then we get you yours,

29:57.671 --> 29:59.923
and we're all
set for my party.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.718
The hottest,
choicest party of the year.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.636
(MAKES RECORD SCRATCHING
SOUNDS)

30:05.095 --> 30:08.432
Okay. When
you see Robbie
and I walk this way,

30:08.474 --> 30:13.687
you let Angus go
so Robbie can find him,

30:13.729 --> 30:16.064
resulting in high
self esteem for him

30:16.106 --> 30:17.899
and
a celebration
snogathon for me.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.278
Yeah, got it. Is that Tom?

30:22.529 --> 30:26.241
Oh, he has got a fit bum.

30:26.283 --> 30:29.662
(EXCLAIMS)
Quality lushness!

30:29.703 --> 30:32.289
Oh, I wish
I could just go up
and snog his face off.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.166
Honestly, Jas.

30:34.207 --> 30:37.503
Sometimes I think
you're half girl,
half turnip.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.797
Just focus on the plan.
Oh, God, you're right.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.131
(MEOWS)

30:45.969 --> 30:47.179
WOMAN:
Have you done those
flower pots for me, son?

30:47.220 --> 30:48.764
ROBBIE:
Yes. Yes, Mum.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.392
ROBBIE: Hiya.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.394
Oh, hi.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.899
Are you okay? What's wrong?

31:01.234 --> 31:04.488
It's my cat. He's lost.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.160
I don't know
what happened.
He just disappeared.

31:12.871 --> 31:16.458
I'd go out and look with you
but I've got to help my mum
in the shop.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.086
I'll put it in the window.

31:20.128 --> 31:24.007
Sure. Thanks, Robbie.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.016
ROBBIE: Georgia!

31:36.102 --> 31:39.064
If I lost Jubbly,
I'd be really upset, too.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.274
Yeah, I'm pretty gutted.

31:43.652 --> 31:47.531
TOM:
Ben, Ben, Ben!
Get it, Ben, go!

31:53.078 --> 31:54.162
WOMAN: Trixie.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.665
(SHRIEKS) Angus, stop!

31:59.459 --> 32:00.711
Are you all right?

32:00.753 --> 32:02.212
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.714
Can you get the cat?
No worries.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.175
WOMAN: Trixie, come back!

32:11.346 --> 32:12.972
GEORGIA: Angus?

32:13.014 --> 32:18.395
Come on, you fluffy cat.
Angus? Angus?

32:18.437 --> 32:21.774
So, are you glad you
moved to Eastbourne?

32:21.815 --> 32:24.693
Yeah. Have you
always lived here?

32:24.735 --> 32:27.404
Yeah. It's called
God's Waiting Room

32:27.446 --> 32:29.155
'cause it's where
people come to die.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.866
(CHUCKLES)

32:30.908 --> 32:33.577
I heard
Eastbourne's
the new Brighton.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.537
(CHUCKLING)
Don't be stupid.

32:37.955 --> 32:40.417
It's
more peaceful
here than London.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.589
I like to come to
the beach. Write songs.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.591
About what?

32:47.633 --> 32:48.550
Angus?

32:50.552 --> 32:52.262
I don't know,
life, the universe.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.266
How reality TV
is brainwashing us.
Wow.

32:58.101 --> 33:00.771
Angus?
Come on, you fluffy cat.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.273
So, what do the
Stiff Dylans sound like?

33:03.315 --> 33:06.777
Well, actually we've
got a lot of influences,

33:06.819 --> 33:08.821
Radiohead, Pink Floyd.

33:08.862 --> 33:12.031
My dad
listens to Pink Floyd
when he's been on the  vino.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.618
He knows all
the words backwards.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.704
My dad plays air
guitar really badly.
He thinks he's Hendrix.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.372
Does he make
a wicked guitar face?

33:19.414 --> 33:20.958
Oh, not as wicked as me.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.084
I've taken
the uncool guitar
face to a whole new level.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.795
Let's see one then.

33:25.629 --> 33:26.797
(LAUGHS)

33:37.641 --> 33:38.475
(WHOOPS)

33:47.484 --> 33:51.613
Thank you and good night,
Eastbourne.

33:51.655 --> 33:52.906
You've been a great crowd.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.282
Rock on! Whoo-hoo!

33:54.324 --> 33:57.661
(BOTH LAUGHING)

34:00.539 --> 34:03.500
I don't
think Angus is here.
He likes the park, too.

34:06.127 --> 34:07.504
Okay, let's go.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.016
So, is that your
mum behind the till?

34:19.056 --> 34:20.433
Yeah.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.520
She's really pretty.
Mine's mental.

34:24.604 --> 34:26.815
No, honestly,
she's mad as a hatter.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.819
She's actually become
quite a regular customer.

34:30.861 --> 34:33.739
Oh, my God.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.241
Promise
you won't take anything
she says about me seriously.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.701
That's no problem.

34:40.662 --> 34:42.873
So, does your dad
work in the shop,
too?

34:44.290 --> 34:46.209
No, he's in London.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.171
My parents just got divorced.

34:50.881 --> 34:54.051
Oh, sorry.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.553
It's okay.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.890
That's why
my mum opened the shop.
She's always wanted one.

34:59.932 --> 35:02.809
It's good that Tom and I can
keep an eye on her, you know?

35:02.851 --> 35:04.227
(ANGUS SCREECHING)

35:06.730 --> 35:08.398
What's wrong?

35:08.440 --> 35:11.150
Nothing,
I thought I
heard something.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.029
Robbie!

35:14.071 --> 35:15.822
Look, Georgia,
my brother's found him.

35:15.864 --> 35:16.907
Yeah.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.409
Angus. Come here.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.578
Angus!

35:22.996 --> 35:25.290
I'm sorry, Georgia.
You messed it all up.

35:25.331 --> 35:26.165
You were meant
to be waiting...
Over there.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.667
...by the fountain.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.086
I couldn't.
That cat is mental.

35:29.126 --> 35:30.754
It's okay, it's all right.
I'll get him.

35:32.297 --> 35:33.924
He went down there.

35:36.342 --> 35:37.385
ROBBIE: Ouch.

35:40.263 --> 35:45.435
Angus,
come here. Gotcha.
Come on, boy, it's okay.

35:46.519 --> 35:50.440
Good boy.
Got you. I've got him.

35:52.025 --> 35:53.902
Are you okay?

35:53.944 --> 35:56.113
TOM: Easy, Rob.
He nearly broke Jas' arm.

35:56.153 --> 35:58.197
ROBBIE:
Yeah, where'd
you find him, Jas?

35:58.239 --> 35:59.950
Georgia said she's
been looking all day.

36:01.618 --> 36:05.455
I found him in the park by
the fountain.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.459
That's lucky. That's
where we were looking.

36:09.501 --> 36:13.296
Angus was raised by a family
of Scottish beavers.
He loves water.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.632
Yeah?
Yeah.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.095
Here we go.

36:20.137 --> 36:22.639
What were you doing?
Thanks, Robbie.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.100
You saved him.

36:27.978 --> 36:31.314
Oh, Robbie. Lindsay called
and she's waiting for you
on the pier.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.192
Right, I'd better go.

36:36.111 --> 36:40.281
Sure. No problem.
Thanks again for
helping me.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.035
Yeah,
yeah, it was fun.
I'll see you later.

36:43.076 --> 36:44.703
All right, Jas.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.204
Oh, yeah.
See ya later then.

36:46.245 --> 36:47.664
Yeah, see ya later.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.168
"See ya later." Again.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.046

1:01:28.684 --> 1:01:31.062
She saw my designs
for your party invite.

1:01:31.104 --> 1:01:32.730
What?

1:01:32.772 --> 1:01:35.400
Well,
I was showing Tom
and she grabbed them.

1:01:35.442 --> 1:01:37.693

looked really
artistic.

going to do now?

have anything left to
talk about.

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:57.839
Mum,
we're having a crisis
and you're not helping.

1:01:57.881 --> 1:02:00.467
You won't let me have
a cool party in a club,

1:02:00.509 --> 1:02:03.595
and now everyone's going
to laugh at me for being
so lame,

1:02:03.637 --> 1:02:05.847
and no decent boys
will ever want to
know me

1:02:05.889 --> 1:02:09.643

who had the sad party
that no one went to.

someone that can't see
how brilliant you are.

1:02:42.718 --> 1:02:46.471
Mum, what exactly
has Jas told you?

1:02:46.513 --> 1:02:49.516
She didn't say
any more than that.

1:02:49.558 --> 1:02:51.226

it's your business.

and whenever you want.

don't need to learn
about astronomy right now.

No, honey, this is
a very special book

1:03:20.130 --> 1:03:24.008

to the curious way of
the male species.

1:03:24.050 --> 1:03:29.556

were from a different planet.

1:03:29.598 --> 1:03:32.267

And they act like they
like you and then they
just ignore you.

they decide they want
to move to New Zealand.

gave me this book.

get Robbie back.

my brother wasn't good
enough for her?

1:14:15.993 --> 1:14:18.204
I didn't mean that.
We were fighting...

1:14:18.246 --> 1:14:19.830
Does
that mean I'm not good
enough for you, either?

1:14:19.872 --> 1:14:22.417
No, of course not.

different than that,
