00:02.070 --> 00:02.703
-Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.736 --> 00:04.072
-KATE: Toby!
What?

00:05.039 --> 00:06.474
ARROYO:
I know how difficult this is,

00:06.507 --> 00:08.376
but good news is,
is that you got pregnant,

00:08.409 --> 00:11.312
which means that you can
try again as soon as four weeks.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.913
Thank you
for doing this wedding, lady.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.715
Any family of yours
is mine, right?

00:14.748 --> 00:16.016
I liked your toast.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.419
-Thank you.

00:19.587 --> 00:20.888
Sorry it's the couch
for tonight.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.556
Good night, Deja.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.225
Good night.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.259
SHAUNA:
I got to go.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.595
And I can't take her with me.

00:30.464 --> 00:34.535
You're not just
my great love story, Rebecca.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.270
You were my big break.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.371
And our love story--

00:37.405 --> 00:39.240
I know it may not feel like it

00:39.273 --> 00:41.242
right now, but I promise you,

00:41.275 --> 00:44.145
it's just getting started.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.216
("Treetop Flyer"

00:57.258 --> 01:00.761
* I could be a rambler

01:00.794 --> 01:04.265
* From the seven dials

01:05.299 --> 01:07.535
* I don't pay taxes

01:07.568 --> 01:10.471
* I never file

01:10.504 --> 01:13.040
MAN:
Yeah, Ma.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.709
I-I'll just rent a car at the
airport tonight, drive to you.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.646
I make lasagna, ah?
Your favorite.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.947
Right now I got nerves so bad,

01:19.980 --> 01:21.782
I-I can't even think
about eating.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.884
Don't have nerves.
You will be great.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.453
Dad and the boys excited
about today?

01:25.486 --> 01:27.054
Your father,
your brothers, everybody,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.423
so very excited about today.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.392
What about you, Ma?

01:31.425 --> 01:32.993
I just cook. You know this.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.828
Ma, I'm going out with Michael.

01:35.796 --> 01:36.797
Don't get pregnant, ah?

01:37.998 --> 01:41.001
-Mmm.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.338
Let's make a baby.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.576
I'm your huckleberry.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.811

01:50.844 --> 01:53.013
* I could be a rambler

01:53.046 --> 01:57.985
* From the seven dials

01:58.018 --> 01:59.953
* Don't pay taxes

01:59.987 --> 02:01.889
* I never file

02:03.957 --> 02:05.793
* I don't do business

02:05.826 --> 02:08.596
* That don't make me smile...

02:08.629 --> 02:09.830
So the pregnancy was a fluke.

02:09.863 --> 02:13.767
No, no. But it's good
we're looking into this now.

02:13.801 --> 02:17.271
The tests show you have PCOS.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.706
It could be linked
to your weight

02:18.739 --> 02:21.175
and causing fertility problems.

02:21.209 --> 02:24.178
I'd also like to have
you checked, Toby.

02:27.381 --> 02:31.151
* I love my aeroplane

02:31.185 --> 02:32.653
* She got style

02:32.686 --> 02:35.923
* Treetop flyer

* Born survivor

02:50.738 --> 02:53.574
Deja... what is this?

02:53.607 --> 02:56.009
What did you do?

02:56.043 --> 02:57.511
I'm sorry.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.854
We've been working through a lot
this summer since your mom left.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.189
Those feelings don't just
go away overnight.

03:09.223 --> 03:12.226
Whew!
Wearing out my running shoes

03:12.260 --> 03:13.927
keeping up with you, girl.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.596
JUDGE:
Ms. Andrews,

03:15.629 --> 03:18.732
do you understand that you are
voluntarily giving up

03:18.766 --> 03:20.534
all of your rights as a parent

03:20.568 --> 03:22.903
and that this decision
is permanent?

03:22.936 --> 03:24.104
Yes.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.839
And the father was given notice
of today's hearing.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.575
No objection there.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.110
He's not gonna object.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.946
He made it clear
he wants no part.

03:38.151 --> 03:41.422
* Born survivor...

03:41.455 --> 03:44.858
So I say to her,
"Babe, I can't tonight.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.861
You know my rule:
no hanky-panky before work."

03:47.895 --> 03:49.797
*

03:51.265 --> 03:53.701
Oh, God, I can't.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.636
Beth would kill me.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.238
* Born survivor

03:58.272 --> 04:00.908
Beth doesn't need
to know everything.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.318
-Oh.
-It's good!

04:10.351 --> 04:12.420
-The crowd goes crazy!

04:12.453 --> 04:14.154
*

04:19.493 --> 04:22.129
Nothing.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.837
The pro football playoffs
began today,

05:03.871 --> 05:05.773
and the American Football
Conference Pittsburgh

05:05.806 --> 05:08.442
defeated Oakland by the score
of 13 to seven.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.711
The game ended
in very remarkable fashion...

05:10.744 --> 05:12.713
I've never seen a game
end like that.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.715
Crazy.
Just crazy.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.785
*

05:17.818 --> 05:20.654
I love this song.

05:20.688 --> 05:24.892
* I'm bein' followed
by a moonshadow *

05:24.925 --> 05:28.862
* Moonshadow, moonshadow

05:28.896 --> 05:32.966
* Leapin' and hoppin'
on a moonshadow *

05:33.000 --> 05:35.503
* Moonshadow, moonshadow

05:35.536 --> 05:37.405
Hey, look at this guy.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.474
-He's done for.

05:40.508 --> 05:44.745
* Lose my plow
and lose my land *

05:44.778 --> 05:49.349
* Oh, if I ever lose my hands

05:52.720 --> 05:54.722
*

06:02.796 --> 06:04.064
My mother says
at a certain point

06:04.097 --> 06:06.233
I have to get realistic
about my life.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.570
but I just-- I don't know
if I agree with that.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.371
You know what I mean?
Because I'm a singer.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.741
: Wow, I said that
out loud, that I'm a singer.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.343
I'm a singer.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.446
I have been sending my demo off,

06:18.479 --> 06:21.048
and I have this dream of signing
with Reprise Records

06:21.081 --> 06:22.049
out in Los Angeles.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.283
They're the ones who put out

06:23.316 --> 06:25.285
-the last Joni Mitchell
album, Blue.
-Oh...

06:25.318 --> 06:27.087
I'm sorry, I feel like
I'm talking too much.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.856
Am I talking too much?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.791
'Cause I feel like
I'm talking too much.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.493
Please tell me something
about you.

06:34.462 --> 06:39.600
Uh... well... my name's Jack.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.506
Okay, that's a good place
to start, Jack.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.876
Do you...

06:48.909 --> 06:51.111
Do you maybe want
to get out of here?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.582
I don't mean that
the way that it sounded.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.083
-I just...
-Yeah.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.118
-The food here is terrible.
-No, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no,

06:58.151 --> 07:00.120
-let's get out of here.
-Okay, great.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.755
I'm gonna go get my jacket.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.591
All right.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.958
-I'll meet you outside.
-Okay.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.737
Jesus, what the hell
happened, man?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.672
I met the girl.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.574
You met a girl while...

07:20.608 --> 07:22.843
No, no, no, no.
The girl.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.112
Hey, h

07:25.145 --> 07:27.748
None. Which is why
we're here in the first place.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.949
Hurry up. How much money
you got on you?

07:28.982 --> 07:32.986
All right, I got...

07:33.020 --> 07:34.922
I got four bucks.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.825
Four bucks? Okay.
I-I got five.

07:37.858 --> 07:41.529
Nine bucks to show my dream girl
the night of her life.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.464
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.465
-Hi.
-Hey.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.200
-Yeah.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.236
*

08:18.098 --> 08:20.100
*

08:30.711 --> 08:32.212
I didn't get him anything.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.082
Please.
You're a kid.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.151
Just paint some macaroni,
throw it on a piece of string,

08:38.185 --> 08:41.254
and call it a day.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.157
-Mm-mm.
-Aw, damn.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.159
I wanted to surprise you
with breakfast in bed.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.028
Happy birthday, baby.
Mmm.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.229
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.699
I just finished working out.
Sorry, I stink.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.400
-I love your stink.
-Mm-hmm.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.102
-Oh... oh...

08:55.135 --> 08:57.037
-Damn.
-Hey, I warned you.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.071
Oh, you did.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.874
Yo, it's a good thing
Zoe's staying here

09:00.908 --> 09:02.743
while she's making
her documentary.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.878
Otherwise, Deja might
never smile again.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.180
You really want to have
the talk with her today?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.849
Can't keep avoiding it.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.584
Plus, I got a plan.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.752
I can connect with her on this.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.521
Oh, hon, uh, don't shoot,
I'm just the messenger,

09:14.554 --> 09:15.923
but Kevin has requested

09:15.956 --> 09:17.524
a gluten-free birthday cake
tonight.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.259
Kevin's coming tonight?

09:20.560 --> 09:24.297
It's cool.
It's cool.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.737
Now I'm sure of it.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.805
Your brother and my cousin
are knockin' boots.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.807
What you talking about, Beth?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.308
It's an expression
from the '90s.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.376
It means that they are
having sex.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.145
I'm familiar with
the expression, woman.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.880
I'm just asking
why are you so positive?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.381
-Because I know.
-But you don't.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.050
-You need to talk to him.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.584
Tell him to "get the hell
off of Beth's cousin

09:44.618 --> 09:45.585
before I kill you in the face."

09:45.619 --> 09:47.220
I will say no such thing,

09:47.254 --> 09:49.456
especially when we have
no evidence to prove it.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.992
And I need you to swear that
you won't say anything tonight.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.561
-Hey-hey-hey, it is my birthday.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.397
And I need you to swear to it
on Oprah.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.800
I'm not doing that.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.301
Beth.

10:02.335 --> 10:05.906
Fine. I will swear on Oprah.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.008
Thank you.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.845
Hey, Deja, come on,
let's take a ride.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.990
Even Gayle let Oprah down
sometimes.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.658
Heard it was your birthday.
What are you turning?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.760
Oh, yeah, I'm turning
30-none-of-your-business.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.428
That's how old I'm turning.
Thank you.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.130
Few of my colleagues screened
the movie last night.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.298
They were raving about it.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.766
-Yeah.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.434
Oh, man, I hope so.
I haven't seen it yet.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.103
You know, truth be told,
I'm, uh, scared to see it.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.105
I'm just gonna wait
till the premiere next week.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.708
I'm gonna watch it then
and just rip the Band-Aid off.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.811
-Sure. Go ahead.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.714
I'll be right back. Okay.
-Yeah.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.282
Hey. So, what am I, just an
afternoon booty call to you?

10:49.316 --> 10:50.818
Because that would be amazing.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.485
You can't come
to your birthday party tonight.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.321
-Oh, um...

10:54.354 --> 10:56.790
If she sees us together,
Beth is gonna figure it out.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.558
She's already been
sniffing things out.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.794
She is like a secret bloodhound.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.562
Meaning she sniffs out secrets
like a bloodhound,

11:02.595 --> 11:04.297
or she's actually
secretly a bloodhound?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.632
-You have to cancel.
-I'm not canceling.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.034
This is my birthday party, okay?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.235
I'm not canceling-- you cancel.

11:08.268 --> 11:12.339
Okay. No touching,

11:12.372 --> 11:15.042
no flirting, and, um,
don't do that thing

11:15.075 --> 11:16.409
where you half smile,
'cause automatically,

11:16.443 --> 11:18.078
it makes me full smile,
and she'll see.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.313
Fine. But you know what?
You can't dress all crazy, okay?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.716
Because for some reason, the
more you dress like Mia Farrow,

11:22.750 --> 11:23.984
the hotter I get.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.353
-Fine.
-Fine.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.755
Oh, and you know what?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.389
Don't talk about
your weird documentary.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.591
Okay? Because it makes
you sound really smart,

11:31.624 --> 11:33.894
and when you sound really smart,
I half smile,

11:33.927 --> 11:36.163
and when I half smile,
it makes you full smile.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.733
You hung up on "fine,"
didn't you?

11:39.767 --> 11:42.936
Yeah, you did.
Hung up on "fine."

11:42.970 --> 11:44.972
Fine.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.077
:
"In vitro fertilization..."

11:50.110 --> 11:51.912
:
Stop with the notebook.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.114
I am writing down key words
so I can remember stuff.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.289
As you can see, I have
polycystic ovary syndrome.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.723
-And Toby...
-Yeah.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.726
I-I ha sperm,
just not a lot of them.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.729
You know, and none of them are
breaking 40-yard dash records

12:09.763 --> 12:11.932
at the NFL Combine,
if you know what I'm saying.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.566
You've been on
the antidepressant how long?

12:13.600 --> 12:14.768
Uh, six years.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.703
Well, it's possible

12:16.736 --> 12:18.471
they're causing
the decreased sperm count.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.774
Uh, it's also possible
that they're preventing me

12:20.808 --> 12:22.409
from crying all the time, so...

12:26.113 --> 12:29.049
Look, Doc, this is why we're
here, okay? To start IVF.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.252
You are the best
and Kate is the best

12:32.285 --> 12:34.254
and I am the best.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.289
-So...

12:37.657 --> 12:40.794
Um, it's my 38th birthday,

12:40.828 --> 12:45.565
and sometimes, I swear, I can
hear the clock just ticking.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.767
Uh, but when we got
this appointment with you,

12:47.801 --> 12:50.103
on my birthday no less,

12:50.137 --> 12:53.473
I feel like the universe
just intervened.

12:53.506 --> 12:57.310
I know this isn't
what you want to hear,

12:57.344 --> 13:02.983
but I'm not going to be able
to take you on as a patient.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.752
Wh Why?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.320
At your weight,

13:07.354 --> 13:09.957
the chances of a successful
pregnancy are very slim,

13:09.990 --> 13:11.825
even if you go through in vitro.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.662
Yeah, we know. And we don't
care, and we, we want to try.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.965
And I admire that.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.601
But egg retrieval is invasive.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.704
At your BMI,
going under anesthesia

13:24.737 --> 13:27.140
for an elective procedure
is not advisable.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.775
Yeah, we know all the risks.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.344
We've talked about it
for hours on end.

13:31.378 --> 13:36.449
All right? But we, we want
to take our chances.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.785
It's not just up to me,
unfortunately.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.455
I have partners at my practice,
there are liability issues.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.825
I'm not gonna be able
to help you here, Kate.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.128
And I fear
you'll be hard-pressed

13:48.161 --> 13:51.364
to find anyone who will.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.008
Okay. Got it.

14:01.041 --> 14:05.245
Thank you
for explaining that to us.

14:05.278 --> 14:09.349
Um, my friend is throwing me
a birthday brunch, so...

14:09.382 --> 14:12.352
I know it's difficult.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.588
Yeah.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.626
Is that it?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.497
Okay, uh, it was
really nice to meet you.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.533
Excuse me.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.210
I would not have taken you
for a carnival type of guy.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.745
Oh, yeah. Love a good carnival.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.114
Two tickets?
That'll be, uh, five bucks.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.950
No, no, no. I, I got it.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.584
-Yeah.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.053
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.055
Crazy.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.856
-Crazy.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.124
What game?

14:52.325 --> 14:55.528
New to America. Yeah.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.934
They have candy apples?

15:00.968 --> 15:02.735
-I love candy apples.
-Oh.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.371
When I was a little girl,

15:04.404 --> 15:06.406
-I lost a baby tooth
in a candy apple...

15:06.439 --> 15:07.975
and I put the whole thing
underneath my pillow

15:08.008 --> 15:10.477
for the tooth fairy.
My mother was furious,

15:10.510 --> 15:13.080
because, of course,
I ruined a set of pillowcases.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.615
Well, how-how about we, uh,
how about we get you one

15:15.648 --> 15:17.484
for old times' sake?

15:17.517 --> 15:18.718
Yeah.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.720
-Okay.
-Sure.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.456
Oh, and a hot chocolate.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.758
-Sure.
-Thank you.

15:27.294 --> 15:31.098
Um, one hot chocolate
and one candy apple?

15:31.131 --> 15:34.134
That'll be two dollars.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.837
Insane.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.240
Thank you.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.408
You didn't want anything?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.010
-No, I'm okay.
-Oh.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.344
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.514
Mmm.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.083
What?

15:50.117 --> 15:52.952
You, uh, you got something

15:52.986 --> 15:54.621
-on your, on your...

15:54.654 --> 15:56.023
-It's a piece of candy.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.657
Yeah...
-Yeah.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.161
Thank you.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.295
-Uh-huh.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.972
Hello, hello.
Cool uncle in the house.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.941
-Good.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.609
-Yeah.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.511
-Since the wedding.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.281
You swore on Oprah, you swore
on Oprah, you swore on Oprah.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.050
I've been hanging out here
a lot, seeing the girls.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.052
-Okay.
-Cutting my documentary
in the city.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.620
Oh, hey, Beth.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.689
We just ran into each other
out here.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.191
Cool, cool.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.962
You two are knocking boots.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.764
-Oh.
-Uh...

16:40.167 --> 16:42.335
You know, we don't have
to go to this thing.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.371
We can just call and tell 'em
you're not feeling well.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.906
Tobe, I can't bail
on my own party.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.176
Honestly. And I'm fine.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.512
It's not the first time
I caught a bad break.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.185
-Hey. Hi.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.187
ALL:
Hi!

17:00.220 --> 17:02.222
*

17:16.403 --> 17:19.639
RANDALL:
Okay. We're here.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.719
So...

17:32.752 --> 17:35.722
this is the apartment building
Beth and I bought last year.

17:35.755 --> 17:40.560
It's where I found
my biological father.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.796
Knocked on the door
of that building two years ago.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.233
Two years ago to the day.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.067
Came in hot, too.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.802
Banging on that mug
like a Real Housewife,

17:49.836 --> 17:53.206
ready to throw down,
you know what I'm saying?

17:53.240 --> 17:56.809
You see, my father--
my biological father--

17:56.843 --> 18:01.281
was standing on the other side
of that door.

18:01.314 --> 18:04.484
Wound up getting
less than a year with him.

18:04.517 --> 18:08.421
I found him, then I lost him
all over again.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.423
Then I bought his building.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.560
Guess you don't have to drop
a hundo an hour on a therapist

18:13.593 --> 18:15.162
to crack that case, huh?

18:21.468 --> 18:25.172
It has defined my life,
being adopted.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.175
It's defined my life,
even when I didn't realize

18:28.208 --> 18:29.809
it was defining it.

18:29.842 --> 18:34.581
And I think the part of that,
at least for me,

18:34.614 --> 18:37.417
is that this big giant thing
happened to me,

18:37.450 --> 18:40.487
and I didn't have any say in it.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.956
And I don't want that
to be the case for you.

18:48.861 --> 18:53.433
Deja, we'd like
to formally adopt you.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.835
They're saying we can't
foster you forever,

18:55.868 --> 18:58.838
that we got to sign some papers
and start a process.

18:58.871 --> 19:02.475
And as much
as we would love that,

19:02.509 --> 19:04.911
we don't want it to happen
unless it's your choice.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.549
You want me
to say something, I know.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.784
No, I'm okay
with whatever you decide,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.386
just as long
as it's your choice.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.422
My choice.

19:17.357 --> 19:21.661
Look, you're a very nice person

19:21.694 --> 19:24.497
and you have a very nice family,

19:24.531 --> 19:29.068
and I'm real grateful for...
what you've done for me,

19:29.101 --> 19:33.840
but when you try and pretend
like we're the same...

19:33.873 --> 19:35.875
-I'm not trying to pretend...

19:35.908 --> 19:38.411
'Cause I feel like
we just drove an hour

19:38.445 --> 19:41.514
just so you could show me
how the same we are.

19:43.450 --> 19:46.886
You had one family
your whole life.

19:46.919 --> 19:50.423
Two dads who loved you.

19:50.457 --> 19:54.193
I had one dad
who never wanted me.

19:54.227 --> 19:57.830
One mom who left me.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.000
So don't tell me
we're the same, Randall.

20:01.033 --> 20:05.972
Don't tell me that I have
a choice in anything.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.879
I'd like to leave now
if that's okay.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.422
-I'm sorry I keep rambling.
-No, no.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.223
Will you please tell me
something about you?

20:24.257 --> 20:26.192
Like, I don't even know
what do you do.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.095
I'm kind of
in between jobs right now.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.730
-Mm-hmm.
-I just...

20:30.763 --> 20:32.131
I just-- I got,
I got back from Vietnam

20:32.164 --> 20:33.700
-not too long ago.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.268
-Yeah.
-Wow.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.369
Yeah.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.938
Oh, God, was it just awful?

20:38.971 --> 20:41.608
I mean, of course it was.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.042
I'm so sorry that I asked.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.244
No, no. No, no, no.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.619
I was just a mechanic.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.155
-Huh.
-Yeah.

20:56.188 --> 20:59.326
Do you have any siblings?

21:00.827 --> 21:03.596
I had a brother.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.798
He died in the war.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.800
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.235
God, I'm so sorry.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.237
I had no idea.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.272
Of course you didn't.

21:18.210 --> 21:21.280
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's...

21:22.782 --> 21:26.353
You know what?
Can we try something?

21:26.386 --> 21:28.154
Let's answer at the same time.

21:28.187 --> 21:29.622
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.290
Cats or dogs?

21:31.324 --> 21:33.259
-Dogs.
-Cats.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.996
-Sure.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.666
-Um, pizza toppings.
-Okay.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.801
Mushrooms or pepperoni?

21:41.834 --> 21:43.903
-Pepperoni.
-Mushrooms.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.174
Is that rain?

21:48.207 --> 21:50.009
I think it's raining.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.978
Yeah, I think it is raining.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.312
Oh, wow, look.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.614
That guy's already
selling umbrellas.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.016
Should we go get one?

21:57.049 --> 22:00.853
I-I don't think it's raining
that bad, right?

22:00.887 --> 22:06.192
Uh... uh, I guess not.

22:06.225 --> 22:08.294
I mean, if you want,
I can buy you an umbrella,

22:08.327 --> 22:12.365
but... I don't think
it's raining that hard is all.

22:12.399 --> 22:15.668
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.537
Okay.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.541
BETH: Zoe, you could be
with any other guy.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.975
-ZOE: Yes, I'm gonna be
with Kevin.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.343
-What in the holy hell
are you thinking?!

22:24.377 --> 22:25.645
-Yes.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.879
I'm thinking
he looks like Batman

22:26.913 --> 22:28.314
and he is built like a truck.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.149
-That's why.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.152
-Yeah.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.054
Are you dating Zoe?

22:35.087 --> 22:37.490
ZOE: I think I can make
my own decisions on who I date.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.859
! Kevin?!
-ZOE: Yes, Kevin!

22:39.892 --> 22:41.227
You know, we've been
hanging out.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.495
We've been hanging out
a lot, actually.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.764
You know, we don't, uh...

22:44.797 --> 22:48.535
we don't talk about
anything real or intense.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.503
And for me, you know,
that's-that's sort of

22:50.537 --> 22:52.071
the barometer of dating, right?

22:52.104 --> 22:53.540
Then again, I did date
Jennifer Love Hewitt

22:53.573 --> 22:54.907
for the better part of a year,

22:54.941 --> 22:56.843
and we talked
about nothing intense.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.711
Do you know that he dated
the woman from Party of Five?

22:58.745 --> 23:00.012
Well, I love Neve Campbell.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.615
Can you keep a secret?
Just between us gals?

23:02.649 --> 23:05.351
Huh? Huh.

23:05.384 --> 23:10.089
I, uh... I was gonna invite her
to my premiere.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.791
You know, sort of like
I was asking her to prom.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.627
You know what I mean? I thought
it'd be kind of, kind of cute.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.529
Do you think she'd like that?
-Yeah.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.698
-BETH: Why do you want
to sit where you eat, Zoe?!

23:18.731 --> 23:22.068
Well, I'm gonna go
check that out. Okay?

23:22.101 --> 23:23.870
I'm gonna brave that one.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.304
-Zoe, you're acting
like a child.
-I am not.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.439
-KEVIN: Hey.

23:26.473 --> 23:30.910
You, out. You, sit.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.712
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.648
Nope. Can't even look at you.

23:35.682 --> 23:39.151
Get out again.

23:39.185 --> 23:43.990
* Happy birthday, dear Kate

23:44.023 --> 23:47.494
* Happy birthday to you.

23:47.527 --> 23:50.162
All right. Make a wish.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.908
Do you want to know
what I wished for?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.442
Uh, Kate, you can't say that
or it won't come true.

24:03.476 --> 24:07.246
-I wished for a baby.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.181
But you're right, Madison,
it won't come true.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.253
And not because
I said it out loud,

24:14.286 --> 24:16.422
but because we can't.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.625
I can't.

24:22.194 --> 24:25.698
Do you know
that I've lost 40 pounds?

24:25.732 --> 24:28.501
Yep. Slow and steady.
No fad diets, no pills.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.637
No slipups.

24:34.373 --> 24:37.376
I have been trapped...

24:37.409 --> 24:41.514
in this body for so long.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.550
Trapped.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.186
And I try to stay positive.

24:47.219 --> 24:51.057
God, I really do.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.894
And I try not to ask myself:
is my weight

24:54.927 --> 24:56.796
the reason why
I had my miscarriage,

24:56.829 --> 24:59.065
or is it the reason why
we can't get pregnant again?

25:00.933 --> 25:05.638
It's like this black cloud...

25:05.672 --> 25:09.475
follows me around, and
every time I get away from it,

25:09.508 --> 25:11.243
it catches up to me.

25:14.881 --> 25:18.551
I am so tired. I'm tired...

25:18.585 --> 25:21.220
of smiling and pretending
that it's sunny out.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.689
I'm done.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.492
Ooh.

25:26.525 --> 25:31.263
When is the universe
gonna give me a damn break?

25:36.703 --> 25:39.572
So, it's, um, a carrot cake.

25:41.608 --> 25:44.043
Thank you.

25:44.076 --> 25:47.546
Bad idea. Bad, bad idea.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.967
Deja, I'm sorry.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.501
I really screwed that up.

26:11.570 --> 26:15.474
Planned it for weeks, taking
you there, talking to you.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.978
-Kind of memorized my speech.
-I know.

26:22.314 --> 26:26.585
It was lame of me
to compare our situations.

26:26.619 --> 26:30.757
But it's only because I really
want all of this to work out.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.262
I think you're
an exceptional person, Deja.

26:38.497 --> 26:41.500
I miss talking to you.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.341
I'm sorry I screwed up
your birthday, Randall.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.344
No, it...

26:52.378 --> 26:55.114
You didn't...

26:56.515 --> 26:58.718
You didn't screw up my birthday.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.123
It didn't go so great.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.125
Yeah?

27:06.158 --> 27:08.460
I was really hoping
for a win today.

27:08.494 --> 27:11.363
I know.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.769
Zoe and Kevin are doing it.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.205
Yeah?

27:19.238 --> 27:21.808
I had to say something.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.310
I know.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.345
I don't know how you're gonna
make this right with Oprah,

27:26.378 --> 27:27.880
but I know.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.349
I made a donation
to her foundation.

27:30.382 --> 27:31.818
Well, that's a start.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.203
*

28:13.392 --> 28:17.396
You don't have to pretend
like you don't know who I am.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.900
You don't have to pretend like
you do. I really don't care.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.669
I just came here to say

28:23.702 --> 28:27.173
I'm gonna do something
really great with my life

28:27.206 --> 28:29.441
and you're gonna miss it.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.678
And my mom's gonna miss it, too,
but that's okay

28:32.711 --> 28:35.214
'cause I met these people.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.384
They think I'm exceptional.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.120
That's the word
they use about me.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.290
And they actually want me.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.892
Like, they want me so bad

28:45.925 --> 28:51.697
that they plan out
weird conversations to tell me.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.601
So... I came here
to tell you that.

28:57.603 --> 29:01.941
Actually, I came here
to ask you for something.

29:01.974 --> 29:05.812
One thing and then you'll never
have to hear from me again.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.662
You sure you don't want
to play one of the games?

29:23.695 --> 29:25.464
Nah, I'm okay.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.834
Thank you.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.736
-I should probably get home.
-I mean, we could take a walk.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.760
Well, it was very nice
to meet you, Jack.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.630
Thank you for a nice night.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.766
I couldn't pay for the umbrella.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.502
I...

30:03.535 --> 30:05.537
I started the night
with nine bucks.

30:05.571 --> 30:09.842
Five bucks to get in,
two bucks for a candy apple

30:09.876 --> 30:13.112
and a hot chocolate, which is
kind of a rip-off in my opinion,

30:13.145 --> 30:15.147
but that's neither
here nor there.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.950
That left me with two dollars.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.852
And if I bought the umbrella,

30:19.886 --> 30:24.123
then I wouldn't have enough
for any of the games.

30:24.156 --> 30:27.459
I didn't know if you wanted
to play any games,

30:27.493 --> 30:28.995
but I couldn't take that chance

30:29.028 --> 30:31.030
because, well,
I-I-I brought you to a carnival,

30:31.063 --> 30:32.531
and you don't bring a girl
to a carnival

30:32.564 --> 30:35.201
and-and not let her play
any games.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.378
I've been having...

30:46.412 --> 30:50.549
a hard time since I got back.

30:50.582 --> 30:55.587
Making money...
finding my place.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.395
I don't like talking
about the war.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.333
Or my brother.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.568
It makes me sad.

31:09.601 --> 31:13.605
It makes me... angry.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.944
But I like talking to you.

31:17.977 --> 31:21.580
A lot.

31:21.613 --> 31:27.053
You make me feel like I'm home.

31:27.086 --> 31:31.924
And I, and I never really
felt like that before.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.765
I'm sorry it was such
a lousy first date.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.969
I mean...

31:43.002 --> 31:46.005
I'm really, very sorry.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.483
-Allergic.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.751
Oh. And mushrooms?

31:59.785 --> 32:01.954
-Oh, I hate 'em.

32:01.988 --> 32:03.589
No, like,
I passionately hate them.

32:03.622 --> 32:04.790
:
Okay.

32:06.825 --> 32:10.462
Oh, yeah, it was a...

32:10.496 --> 32:12.931
pretty bad first date.

32:12.965 --> 32:16.635
-I know.
-* And just a little bit

32:16.668 --> 32:20.572
* Of rain...

32:20.606 --> 32:22.574
My girlfriends told me

32:22.608 --> 32:24.576
I'm supposed to pretend

32:24.610 --> 32:27.980
to forget something in the car

32:28.014 --> 32:29.515
if it's a really great
first date.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.583
That way the guy has to come

32:31.617 --> 32:36.355
and return it
the next day, but...

32:36.388 --> 32:38.657
this was not
that kind of first date,

32:38.690 --> 32:40.926
and I'm not that kind of girl.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.362
Plus, the mushrooms are
a real deal breaker for me.

32:44.863 --> 32:48.767
* Lonely blue and sad times...

32:48.800 --> 32:53.372
Oh, but the way
that you look at me, wow.

32:53.405 --> 32:57.476
* And just a little bit
of rain... *

32:59.978 --> 33:03.882
I never, ever do this.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.962
Good night, Jack.

33:16.995 --> 33:21.333
* And if I look back

33:23.269 --> 33:25.404
* I will remember

33:25.437 --> 33:29.275
* All the good times

33:31.177 --> 33:33.212
* Warm days

33:33.245 --> 33:36.648
* Filled with sunshine...

33:38.717 --> 33:40.819
* And just a little bit

33:40.852 --> 33:43.555
* Of rain...

33:43.589 --> 33:44.756
Hey, listen...

33:44.790 --> 33:46.625
Nope. Me.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.895
All right.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.731
You haven't seen through
a romantic relationship

33:52.764 --> 33:54.166
in your entire life.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.168
-Beth...
-Kevin-- Uh-uh, still me.

33:56.202 --> 33:59.838
Look, I adore you, bro-in-law.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.873
Okay? I know I don't
always say it out loud

34:01.907 --> 34:05.611
because it kind of ruins
my schtick, but I do.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.614
You know, you're the only person
who talks to my kids

34:08.647 --> 34:12.518
like they're people
and not just kids.

34:12.551 --> 34:16.255
You're kind. You're funny.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.757
And...

34:18.790 --> 34:20.192
everything about
the way you look

34:20.226 --> 34:24.062
says people should hate you,
but somehow everybody loves you.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.132
I love you.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.704
She will break you, Kevin.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.474
I have known you for 20 years.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.309
I have known her
all of her life.

34:37.343 --> 34:40.446
Her background is complicated.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.550
She eats men up
and spits them out,

34:44.583 --> 34:46.418
and you won't stand a chance.

34:51.623 --> 34:56.027
I can't believe you know how
to use the word "schtick."

34:58.330 --> 35:01.833
I know a lot of things, Kevin.

35:29.228 --> 35:32.097
There are other ways
to have children.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.566
Yeah, I know.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.304
The whole IVF thing
was stressing me out.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.138
I didn't like hearing
the doctor talk about

35:40.172 --> 35:42.374
how it was dangerous for you.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.144
I was scared, too.

35:48.380 --> 35:52.117
And it probably wouldn't have
worked anyway.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.854
I was hoping you'd change
your mind on the whole thing.

35:55.887 --> 35:59.124
You know, the-the expense,
the hormones, all of it.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.560
I just wasn't feeling it.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.699
Me either.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.669
Look, I can pare back
on my antidepressants,

36:10.702 --> 36:12.304
you know, get my sperm count up.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.506
Maybe we get lucky?
It only takes a couple months

36:14.540 --> 36:16.542
-to get the counts back up.
-No. No way.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.880
So... screw IVF.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.551
Screw IVF.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.586
-Yeah, screw it.
-Yeah.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.931
Hello.

36:39.965 --> 36:43.101
Oh, hi. Um, yes.

36:43.134 --> 36:47.439
5:00. Um, okay. Yeah, thank you.

36:47.473 --> 36:49.941
What 5:00?

36:52.611 --> 36:56.882
That was Dr. Jasper.
She wants us to come back in.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.220
Uh...

37:07.393 --> 37:09.027
All right, everybody,
T-minus five minutes

37:09.060 --> 37:10.629
until the birthday
festivities begin.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.598
Hey, Deja, that means you, too.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.400
Yo, Kev, Zoe!

37:14.433 --> 37:17.102
-Show yourselves
before you get too...
Stop it.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.540
I snuck out.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.743
I went back
to my old neighborhood.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.378
Hey, Deja, there are rules here.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.246
I don't care how upset
you are with us,

37:28.280 --> 37:30.048
you don't get to just
climb out of your window

37:30.081 --> 37:33.419
and go--
Oh... my God, is that for me?

37:38.690 --> 37:40.492
I like surprises.

37:49.701 --> 37:53.004
It's about damn time.
I need the car.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.710
What's with you?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.917
SPORTSCASTER :
When earlier today, we witnessed

38:05.951 --> 38:07.586
one of the most remarkable
comebacks in history.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.955
After Oakland's late touchdown,

38:09.988 --> 38:12.290
it looked like all was lost.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.960
DR. JASPER:
I didn't like this morning.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.362
Watching you leave like that,

38:16.395 --> 38:19.164
crushing you like that.

38:19.197 --> 38:22.368
I got into this to make
the impossible possible,

38:22.401 --> 38:24.035
not more impossible.

38:26.037 --> 38:29.040
I've spoken to my partners.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.477
I've spoken to colleagues
who have had success

38:31.510 --> 38:33.612
with IVF at your weight.

38:33.645 --> 38:38.384
Realistically, there's about
a 90% chance of failure here,

38:38.417 --> 38:42.153
but I'm choosing to look

38:42.187 --> 38:43.989
at the ten percent side today.

38:44.022 --> 38:47.493
So, if you want to move forward,

38:47.526 --> 38:49.895
knowing that,

38:49.928 --> 38:52.364
I will take you on as a patient.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.536
-Really.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.440
Really, really?

39:12.017 --> 39:14.386
SPORTSCASTER :
With just seconds left to play,

39:14.420 --> 39:16.888
Terry Bradshaw's pass
was deflected.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.890
All seemed lost for Pittsburgh

39:18.924 --> 39:21.059
until, in a miraculous
turn of events,

39:21.092 --> 39:22.828
the ball fell
right into the hands

39:22.861 --> 39:25.096
of star running back
Franco Harris,

39:25.130 --> 39:27.533
who ran it in for
the game-winning touchdown

39:27.566 --> 39:29.200
as time expired.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.036
CURT GOWDY :
Franco Harris has it!

39:31.069 --> 39:33.371
And it's over! He grabbed it

39:33.405 --> 39:35.206
with five seconds to go
and scored!

39:58.764 --> 40:00.365
Deja, are these expensive?

40:00.398 --> 40:03.569
-I had a connection.

40:03.602 --> 40:06.137
It's no big deal.

40:06.171 --> 40:10.408
Oh, and you could sign
those papers if you want.

40:13.579 --> 40:14.913
GOWDY: You talk
about Christmas miracles,

40:14.946 --> 40:17.783
here's the miracle
of all miracles.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.619
Franco, you remember now
the ball coming to you?

40:20.652 --> 40:22.821
I don't know, like,
I seen it bounce off

40:22.854 --> 40:26.291
and I just, you know, looked up

40:26.324 --> 40:29.060
and I just put
my hands out and...

40:29.094 --> 40:31.497
Apparently, you're gonna have to

40:31.530 --> 40:33.398
shoot me up
with hormones every day.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.301
It's gonna be like
Requiem for a Dream up in here!

40:36.334 --> 40:38.336
That sounds good, hon.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.677
SPORTSCASTER: It's just one
of those plays that'll go down

40:45.711 --> 40:47.312
in history, a single moment

40:47.345 --> 40:50.448
-that changed destiny forever.

40:50.482 --> 40:53.151
It's time to go see her, Tess.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.987
I'm not ready.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.359
I'm just gonna run to the
restroom before we head over.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.628
I'll be right here.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.776
-Hey, Randall.
: Hey.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.445
You coming down?

41:20.478 --> 41:23.448
Yeah, I don't know
if I should.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.851
She wants you to be there, too.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.453
All right, I'll see you soon.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.889
RANDALL:
All right, bye.

41:30.922 --> 41:34.459
SPORTSCASTER: And while
there may be heartbreak

41:34.492 --> 41:37.195
tonight in Oakland,
here in Pittsburgh,

41:37.228 --> 41:40.198
they're calling it
the Immaculate Reception.

42:08.259 --> 42:11.997
SPORTSCASTER: A reminder
for all of us, I think,

42:12.030 --> 42:15.000
that sometimes a ball
has to bounce off one person

42:15.033 --> 42:17.669
a few times to wind up
in the hands of the right guy

42:17.703 --> 42:21.707
and make a story
truly immortal.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.747
