00:01.149 --> 00:02.750
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:02.793 --> 00:04.273
I never thought
I would see you again.

00:04.627 --> 00:06.311
I wanted to reach out
to you so much,

00:06.346 --> 00:08.597
but I was afraid that I
would jeopardize your safety.

00:08.631 --> 00:10.232
We need your help, Nina.

00:10.266 --> 00:12.801
Hastings, give Dr. Bishop
anything he wants.

00:12.818 --> 00:15.070
Oh, it would be an honor.

00:15.104 --> 00:16.488
<i>Who is that?</i>

00:16.522 --> 00:17.856
It was a case
that we worked.

00:17.907 --> 00:20.943
He started to exhibit
empathic abilities.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.361
Why would I need an empath?

00:22.412 --> 00:24.446
<i>We used this place</i>
<i>to hide him</i>

00:24.480 --> 00:25.981
<i>until someone</i>
<i>could return for him.</i>

00:25.999 --> 00:27.866
There it is.

00:29.035 --> 00:30.586
<i>He's not here.</i>

00:30.620 --> 00:32.988
I think whoever took the boy
left this behind.

00:33.006 --> 00:34.489
<i>It's picking up a signal.</i>

00:34.507 --> 00:36.658
This is where
the signal originates.

00:36.676 --> 00:39.160
<i>What do you want?</i>

00:46.502 --> 00:48.470
He definitely
doesn't have the tech.

00:48.504 --> 00:50.171
<i>Maybe it was removed.</i>

00:50.189 --> 00:51.857
No,
there's no scar tissue.

00:51.891 --> 00:54.726
Here, try this.

00:54.777 --> 00:58.397
Go on. It's good.

01:05.989 --> 01:09.708
Michael, you used to
write things down for me.

01:09.742 --> 01:13.328
<i>You helped us catch a bad man.</i>
<i>Do you remember that?</i>

01:18.034 --> 01:20.035
Michael,
you're very special,

01:20.053 --> 01:24.056
and there's a lot that we would
like to learn about you.

01:26.759 --> 01:30.062
My father was working on a plan
with a man named Donald.

01:30.096 --> 01:32.147
<i>You were a very important</i>
<i>part of that plan.</i>

01:32.181 --> 01:34.983
<i>Do you remember that?</i>

01:35.018 --> 01:37.218
You do,
and you know me.

01:40.056 --> 01:43.191
We should just go into his mind,
like we did with September.

01:43.225 --> 01:44.893
September
was in a coma.

01:44.911 --> 01:46.227
So we put him
in one too.

01:46.245 --> 01:47.696
We're not
putting him in a coma.

01:47.730 --> 01:49.731
Then, we put
an electromagnetic probe

01:49.749 --> 01:51.199
into the base
of his skull,

01:51.233 --> 01:53.502
and ply him full of serotonin,
Neurontin, and LSD.

01:53.536 --> 01:55.337
<i>Walter, he is just a child.</i>

01:55.371 --> 01:57.506
He is not just a child!

01:57.540 --> 01:59.591
<i>He's more than a child.</i>

01:59.625 --> 02:02.577
He is an integral part
of my plan.

02:02.595 --> 02:04.796
<i>He must know that!</i>
<i>He's just not saying anything</i>

02:04.847 --> 02:06.598
<i>for some reason or other.</i>
<i>You said yourself,</i>

02:06.632 --> 02:07.849
he wrote things
before.

02:07.884 --> 02:10.301
Why is he
not doing that now?

02:10.353 --> 02:13.472
Who is Donald?
Where is he? Is he alive?

02:13.523 --> 02:14.806
<i>I must find him.</i>
<i>Tell me.</i>

02:14.857 --> 02:16.558
Hey!
Walter, calm down.

02:16.592 --> 02:18.527
How can I calm down, Peter?
We're running out of time.

02:18.561 --> 02:21.897
<i>Don't you understand?</i>
<i>We got a world to save!</i>

02:23.265 --> 02:25.567
<i>Acid, get back</i>
<i>to cutting out those tapes.</i>

02:25.601 --> 02:28.436
We're not gonna get
any answers out of him.

02:33.493 --> 02:36.078
Peter, it doesn't
make any sense.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.746
I mean,
he's an empath.

02:37.780 --> 02:38.964
We used to have
a connection.

02:38.998 --> 02:40.499
He used to feel
what I wanted

02:40.550 --> 02:42.901
<i>and then</i>
<i>he'd communicate it to me.</i>

02:42.935 --> 02:47.672
Now, it just
seems like he can't.

03:11.571 --> 03:14.190
Nina,
it's Olivia.

03:14.224 --> 03:16.409
Is everything
all right?

03:16.410 --> 03:19.095
Nina, we need
your help with something.

03:24.852 --> 03:26.052
What?

03:31.526 --> 03:32.810
It's not safe
for me to talk here.

03:32.811 --> 03:34.261
Let me call you
in ten minutes.

03:45.957 --> 03:47.941
Can I help you?

04:01.222 --> 04:03.340
You are a Loyalist.

04:03.391 --> 04:05.759
Then you know
how important it is

04:05.793 --> 04:07.728
that you answer
my questions.

04:07.762 --> 04:10.264
Where is your superior?

04:10.298 --> 04:12.633
I'm not sure.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.902
She got a call
a little while ago

04:14.936 --> 04:17.321
and then told me she
was taking an early lunch.

04:17.355 --> 04:18.704
Who was the call from?

04:18.740 --> 04:20.807
It came in
on her private comm.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.309
When did this occur?

04:22.327 --> 04:24.644
About 20 minutes ago.

04:24.662 --> 04:28.031
Bring an LQ7 unit.
We don't have much time.

04:30.418 --> 04:32.286
When is she expected
to return?

04:32.320 --> 04:35.655
She's always back
by 1:00.

04:35.673 --> 04:38.459
Fugitives
we are seeking

04:38.493 --> 04:40.878
recently used
a sublimation device

04:40.929 --> 04:43.480
to access an abandoned
storage facility.

04:43.515 --> 04:47.468
We have traced the device
to the Ministry of Science.

04:47.502 --> 04:49.353
Someone here
has supplied them with it,

04:49.387 --> 04:52.339
I suspect
from this office.

04:55.443 --> 04:57.478
It is not you
I am concerned with.

05:42.357 --> 05:45.442
This is Nina Sharp.

05:45.493 --> 05:48.495
Is everything all right?

05:48.530 --> 05:52.950
<i>We've never seen one before.</i>

05:56.120 --> 05:58.739
What? A child?

06:00.475 --> 06:03.460
A child Observer?

06:03.511 --> 06:04.845
<i>We've never seen one before.</i>

06:04.879 --> 06:07.181
<i>It's not safe</i>
<i>for me to talk here.</i>

06:38.329 --> 06:40.164
Nina, thank you so much
for doing this.

06:40.198 --> 06:42.049
I know the risk
you're taking.

06:42.083 --> 06:46.553
Nonsense. I'm nothing if
I can't be a resource for you.

06:48.923 --> 06:51.508
Now, where is he?

07:05.223 --> 07:07.741
Hello.

07:09.194 --> 07:12.246
My name is Nina.

07:14.365 --> 07:17.367
What are we doing here?

07:17.401 --> 07:19.420
I'm cold.

07:19.454 --> 07:21.338
<i>I have access to tech</i>

07:21.372 --> 07:23.624
that I think will be helpful
for you to communicate with him.

07:23.675 --> 07:25.375
It's in a lab
not far from here.

07:25.409 --> 07:26.643
A ministry lab?
You think that's safe?

07:26.678 --> 07:29.412
Not a ministry lab.
A black lab.

07:29.431 --> 07:33.934
I thought Massive Dynamic
black labs didn't exist.

07:33.968 --> 07:37.137
Well, I'm glad
I can still surprise you.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.641
Since the invasion,
I've allowed it

07:40.692 --> 07:41.859
to be used
by the resistance.

07:45.429 --> 07:47.064
We should get going.

07:52.954 --> 07:55.272
How's Walter doing?

07:55.290 --> 07:57.607
Which one?
Ah.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.461
He's vacillating
lately.

08:00.495 --> 08:02.412
And he dropped acid yesterday,
so that didn't exactly help.

08:02.446 --> 08:06.216
Well,
he hasn't changed that much.

08:07.335 --> 08:09.153
He catches me
off guard.

08:09.187 --> 08:11.505
<i>I look him in the eyes</i>
<i>sometimes,</i>

08:11.556 --> 08:15.175
<i>and I see a stare</i>
<i>that I don't recognize.</i>

08:17.145 --> 08:19.596
He told me that you agreed to
remove the pieces of his brain

08:19.630 --> 08:22.316
once he completed the plan
to defeat the Observers.

08:22.350 --> 08:25.736
Never underestimate
the power of incentive.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.354
You don't approve?

08:27.405 --> 08:30.157
What happens to him?

08:30.191 --> 08:32.075
After the tissue
has been removed,

08:32.110 --> 08:34.278
what happens
to Walter?

08:34.312 --> 08:37.447
How many times can a human brain
endure something like that?

08:37.481 --> 08:39.249
Walter told me that
that was a risk

08:39.284 --> 08:41.919
that he was willing
to take.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.203
I don't accept that.

08:44.255 --> 08:45.506
You may not have to.

08:45.540 --> 08:47.374
If the plan
isn't completed in time,

08:47.425 --> 08:49.009
he may regress
completely

08:49.043 --> 08:51.879
<i>and no longer want</i>
<i>to go through with it.</i>

08:53.598 --> 08:55.832
So what you're saying
is I lose him either way?

08:55.867 --> 08:58.018
What you're saying is
that your father understands

08:58.052 --> 08:59.603
that anything
worth fighting for

08:59.637 --> 09:02.055
comes with a cost.

09:42.680 --> 09:46.099
<i>Perhaps she has been alerted</i>
<i>to our presence here.</i>

09:46.134 --> 09:48.101
It would not be
the first time.

09:50.154 --> 09:53.907
Every conspiracy
has a network.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.411
I want to see the facility
from which

09:57.445 --> 10:00.030
the sublimation device
was taken.

10:45.109 --> 10:46.710
It's okay.

10:48.779 --> 10:50.047
<i>It's better if he stays</i>

10:50.081 --> 10:52.883
<i>back there</i>
<i>for a moment.</i>

11:41.134 --> 11:43.849
The resistance experimented
on Observers here?

11:43.850 --> 11:46.768
Yes. Among other things,
we wanted to understand

11:46.819 --> 11:48.236
how they were
reading us.

11:48.271 --> 11:49.488
Perhaps
create technology

11:49.522 --> 11:50.939
that would give us
the same advantage.

11:50.990 --> 11:52.190
Did it work?

11:52.224 --> 11:53.909
No.
We were only able

11:53.943 --> 11:55.777
to extract
bits and pieces of data.

11:55.828 --> 11:58.163
Images, words
in their conscious minds,

11:58.197 --> 12:00.532
but not enough
to be useful.

12:00.566 --> 12:04.453
However, if you
were able to communicate

12:04.504 --> 12:05.754
<i>with the Observer child</i>

12:05.788 --> 12:07.839
<i>using neural stimulation</i>
<i>once before,</i>

12:07.874 --> 12:12.043
this technology might be able
to help you do it again.

12:15.715 --> 12:17.382
You all right?

12:21.454 --> 12:23.655
You're thinking
about her?

12:23.689 --> 12:26.641
Yeah, every time I see
one of those posters,

12:26.692 --> 12:28.944
my heart jumps.

12:30.095 --> 12:32.564
Yeah, mine too.

12:32.598 --> 12:38.703
It's hard to see her face,
but at the same time, I want to.

12:45.411 --> 12:46.545
You ready in there?

12:46.579 --> 12:49.414
Yeah, yeah.
It's all good.

12:51.801 --> 12:57.255
Like ours, Observer brains
translate external stimuli--

12:57.289 --> 12:58.807
language, sights,
sounds--

12:58.841 --> 13:00.542
<i>into patterns</i>
<i>of electrical activity,</i>

13:00.576 --> 13:03.228
<i>which we commonly call</i>
<i>"thoughts."</i>

13:06.265 --> 13:08.433
Come on, Michael.

13:08.467 --> 13:10.986
This is an electro-cognitive
translator.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.271
<i>An "ECOG" for short.</i>

13:13.305 --> 13:14.823
How does it work?

13:14.857 --> 13:16.658
By interpreting patterns
of electrical activity

13:16.692 --> 13:19.077
into words and images
that we can understand.

13:19.111 --> 13:20.946
Allowing you
to read their thoughts.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.164
For all intents
and purposes, yes.

13:23.199 --> 13:25.200
<i>This will suffice.</i>

13:25.251 --> 13:27.318
Prep the subject.

13:27.336 --> 13:30.255
His name's Michael.

13:40.850 --> 13:44.002
Captain Windmark,
we've been unable to locate

13:44.020 --> 13:45.470
Nina Sharp's
comm device.

13:45.504 --> 13:47.806
Continue looking.

14:12.415 --> 14:14.332
Mr. Rhode,

14:14.366 --> 14:18.036
we have determined
that Nina Sharp is a traitor.

14:18.070 --> 14:21.256
She is working
for the resistance.

14:21.307 --> 14:23.425
Do you have
any knowledge of that?

14:23.476 --> 14:26.678
No.

14:26.712 --> 14:29.731
Do you know
where she is?

14:29.765 --> 14:33.602
No.

14:41.994 --> 14:44.896
I believe you.

14:50.569 --> 14:53.588
This is gonna
be a little cold.

14:57.209 --> 14:59.127
We're just
gonna do a test,

14:59.178 --> 15:01.680
but it won't hurt.
I promise.

15:03.415 --> 15:06.017
His cortical activity
is off the charts.

15:06.052 --> 15:08.053
The neural link is good.
We're ready.

15:08.087 --> 15:09.804
Okay.

15:12.608 --> 15:15.760
Michael, if at any point,
you want to stop,

15:15.778 --> 15:17.696
you just
squeeze my hand.

15:17.730 --> 15:21.265
Okay?

15:26.489 --> 15:28.123
Michael,
do you remember

15:28.157 --> 15:31.876
why you're so important
to Walter's plan?

15:33.162 --> 15:34.879
His mind is responding
to the question.

15:34.914 --> 15:36.548
Hmm.

15:36.582 --> 15:39.951
The ECOG is attempting to
translate his neural activity,

15:39.969 --> 15:42.120
but he's processing
information

15:42.138 --> 15:44.005
in a way I've
never seen before.

15:44.056 --> 15:45.640
This is not like
any of the other Observers

15:45.675 --> 15:48.143
from our trials.

15:48.177 --> 15:50.729
The software
can't interpret it.

15:52.732 --> 15:56.134
Something has fundamentally
changed with the subject.

15:57.987 --> 16:00.438
Michael.

16:00.472 --> 16:02.640
Whatever allowed us
to communicate before

16:02.658 --> 16:04.642
is no longer viable.

16:04.660 --> 16:07.495
You said the boy
formed a bond with Olivia,

16:07.530 --> 16:08.913
helped her
solve a case once.

16:08.948 --> 16:10.532
That's right.

16:10.583 --> 16:11.816
So he did so,

16:11.834 --> 16:13.702
because he knew
what you wanted.

16:13.753 --> 16:14.919
He could feel it

16:14.954 --> 16:16.588
through the empathic
connection with you.

16:16.622 --> 16:18.289
Maybe
he can't help us now

16:18.323 --> 16:19.991
because that connection
no longer exists.

16:20.025 --> 16:23.461
So you're saying he can't
understand what we want?

16:23.495 --> 16:25.630
So how can he help us?

16:25.664 --> 16:27.832
<i>We've been trying</i>
<i>to get into his mind.</i>

16:27.850 --> 16:30.685
Maybe the answer
is letting him get into ours.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.004
<i>Yes.</i>

16:33.022 --> 16:35.724
That is brilliant, Nina.

16:35.775 --> 16:37.341
We need to create a link

16:37.359 --> 16:39.861
between one of our
conscious minds and the boy's.

16:39.895 --> 16:41.529
Well,
how do we do that?

16:41.564 --> 16:42.947
Well, it's going
to take some time,

16:42.982 --> 16:45.233
I have to reconfigure
the ECOG's software,

16:45.284 --> 16:47.736
and you've got to return
to the warehouse

16:47.787 --> 16:50.121
at the Ministry of Science
to get another ECOG halo

16:50.156 --> 16:51.873
and a neural adaptor
for the second person.

16:51.907 --> 16:53.742
Is that going to be
a problem?

16:53.793 --> 16:56.411
No, I've got a man in archives.
He'll give us what we want.

16:56.462 --> 16:58.696
Hastings?
Yes.

17:03.252 --> 17:04.719
Next.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.925
Name?

17:10.976 --> 17:13.895
Hastings, Darryl R.

17:52.992 --> 17:55.787
<i>I still can't</i>
<i>get through to Hastings.</i>

17:55.789 --> 17:57.474
<i>This is intolerable.</i>

17:57.508 --> 18:00.310
Without the neural adaptor
and the second E.C.O.G. halo,

18:00.344 --> 18:01.845
we have no way
to communicate with the boy.

18:01.896 --> 18:04.147
Don't worry, Walter.
We'll get 'em.

18:04.181 --> 18:05.732
Nina will have
the pass code.

18:05.766 --> 18:07.400
Well, her comm
doesn't work underground,

18:07.434 --> 18:09.519
so there's no way
to contact her.

18:09.570 --> 18:12.105
Do you think
that we can bypass this?

18:18.312 --> 18:18.998
Hey, guys.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.333
Astrid,
I need your help

18:20.456 --> 18:21.739
breaking through
a security lock.

18:21.790 --> 18:24.125
I'm on it.
Give me the model number.

18:29.197 --> 18:30.998
Next.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.429
<i>I'm a quality assurance</i>
<i>engineer.</i>

18:44.480 --> 18:46.431
I assess and maintain
the technology

18:46.482 --> 18:48.066
warehoused
in this facility.

18:48.100 --> 18:52.186
I don't report
directly to Nina Sharp,

18:52.220 --> 18:56.390
but indirectly,
sometimes I do.

18:56.408 --> 18:58.793
Mr. Hastings,
we believe--

18:58.827 --> 19:01.028
Doctor.

19:02.948 --> 19:06.667
It's Dr. Hastings.

19:13.074 --> 19:16.010
Dr. Hastings.

19:18.847 --> 19:21.599
Okay, you're gonna want
to take the brown wire

19:21.633 --> 19:26.354
from the pad and attach it
to the comm's receiving node.

19:28.774 --> 19:30.608
<i>All right,</i>
<i>the comm's attached.</i>

19:30.642 --> 19:32.602
Now, I'm going to send
a continuous stream of data

19:32.611 --> 19:34.762
to your comm device.
Hopefully, it'll be enough

19:34.780 --> 19:36.647
to short out
the locking circuitry.

19:36.698 --> 19:38.533
Hopefully? I thought
she knew what she was doing.

19:38.567 --> 19:40.485
<i>Okay, I'm sending it now.</i>

19:40.536 --> 19:43.738
You might
want to step back.

19:48.777 --> 19:50.878
Okay, we're in.

19:52.331 --> 19:55.299
<i>We believe a sublimation device</i>
<i>from this facility</i>

19:55.334 --> 19:58.669
<i>was provided</i>
<i>to known fugitives.</i>

19:58.720 --> 20:00.888
Are you aware of this?

20:02.958 --> 20:05.476
No.

20:07.128 --> 20:10.231
I do not believe you.

20:10.265 --> 20:12.850
<i>Restrain him.</i>

20:17.305 --> 20:20.241
<i>Dismiss the rest.</i>

20:30.485 --> 20:31.752
We may as well be looking

20:31.787 --> 20:33.588
for a needle in a haystack.

20:33.622 --> 20:35.840
No, it's all arranged according
to serial number. Look.

20:39.795 --> 20:41.379
There's a terminal.

20:41.430 --> 20:44.632
Maybe we can access
the database.

20:45.717 --> 20:47.001
<i>Can you run a search?</i>

20:47.019 --> 20:48.719
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:51.523 --> 20:55.109
There. 18-C-6.

21:00.682 --> 21:03.117
Up there,
on the top shelf.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.760
Windmark's here.

21:29.811 --> 21:31.095
What?

21:31.146 --> 21:32.396
He's with Hastings.

21:36.568 --> 21:38.719
It was
an outdated model.

21:38.737 --> 21:40.771
I didn't know
what they were using it for.

21:40.822 --> 21:42.773
You wanted to help them.

21:42.824 --> 21:45.660
You admire them.

21:45.694 --> 21:49.614
You admire Dr. Bishop.

21:52.451 --> 21:55.369
Yes.

21:55.403 --> 21:59.040
I admire him.

21:59.074 --> 22:02.176
Where is Nina Sharp now?

22:03.262 --> 22:05.763
I swear,
I don't know.

22:05.797 --> 22:08.266
Where are
the fugitives?

22:12.054 --> 22:15.222
Your loyalty
will be rewarded.

22:15.256 --> 22:18.592
I don't know.
I don't know.

22:22.981 --> 22:25.449
Michael, I need you
to stay here.

22:25.484 --> 22:26.867
I'll be right back.

22:41.216 --> 22:43.134
There.

22:43.168 --> 22:45.336
That's her signal.

22:46.505 --> 22:48.288
The components are intact.

22:48.307 --> 22:50.257
We got to get out
of here, now.

22:51.510 --> 22:52.643
It's Nina.

22:52.678 --> 22:54.729
Olivia, is everything
all right?

22:54.763 --> 22:57.565
Nina, I need you
to listen to me.

22:57.599 --> 22:59.233
You've been compromised.

22:59.267 --> 23:01.135
What?
<i>The Observers and Windmark</i>

23:01.153 --> 23:03.804
are here. They're
interrogating Hastings now.

23:05.324 --> 23:07.024
You can't come back
to the ministry,

23:07.075 --> 23:08.909
and you can't go home.

23:11.830 --> 23:15.499
It's okay.

23:15.534 --> 23:18.202
I have to go now.

23:18.253 --> 23:20.755
I'm sorry.

23:43.862 --> 23:45.345
Okay, we're ready.
Let's go.

23:45.364 --> 23:47.231
Wait.

23:52.537 --> 23:54.405
They're gone.
A guard just came in

23:54.456 --> 23:57.792
and told Windmark something,
and then they left.

23:59.378 --> 24:01.128
We're going to make
an example out of you.

24:01.163 --> 24:03.030
<i>My thoughts exactly.</i>

24:07.368 --> 24:09.303
Dr. Hastings,
can you hear me?

24:09.337 --> 24:11.972
I tried. I tried.

24:12.007 --> 24:13.474
It's okay.

24:13.508 --> 24:16.560
He knows.

24:16.595 --> 24:19.897
What?
What does Windmark know?

24:19.931 --> 24:22.566
Nina,
they tracked her.

24:25.020 --> 24:27.387
They know where she is.

24:48.188 --> 24:51.680
It's okay.
Everything's going to be fine.

24:51.682 --> 24:53.900
I'm just...

25:00.741 --> 25:03.243
It doesn't matter.

25:03.277 --> 25:06.812
There's nothing
for you to worry about.

25:26.517 --> 25:30.520
Oh, my God.

26:07.874 --> 26:09.509
Michael,

26:09.543 --> 26:11.644
come with me,
quickly.

26:16.066 --> 26:17.901
What's wrong?
Why are we stopping?

26:17.935 --> 26:19.903
<i>Checkpoint.</i>

26:19.937 --> 26:22.689
We need
to turn around.

26:22.723 --> 26:24.440
If I back up now, I turn around,
we're gonna draw

26:24.491 --> 26:26.492
too much attention.
We need to ditch the car.

26:26.527 --> 26:29.078
One at a time.
Walter, you first.

26:31.865 --> 26:34.117
Get out now.

26:40.073 --> 26:41.457
<i>Okay, go.</i>

27:04.114 --> 27:06.532
<i>It's clear. They can go.</i>

28:06.760 --> 28:08.344
Find them.

28:24.361 --> 28:27.196
Captain Windmark.

28:28.816 --> 28:32.368
The fugitives.
Where are they?

28:32.403 --> 28:37.022
You're too late.
They're long gone.

28:37.041 --> 28:40.693
You are trying
to protect them.

28:40.711 --> 28:43.129
What is it
about the fugitives,

28:43.163 --> 28:48.301
I wonder, that instills
such misguided loyalty?

28:51.672 --> 28:55.925
You are trying to block
your thoughts from me,

28:58.112 --> 29:01.314
but it will not last.

29:34.348 --> 29:37.583
You...

29:37.601 --> 29:39.786
Animals.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.846
<i>You are thinking</i>
<i>of him.</i>

30:06.880 --> 30:10.383
The boy.

30:10.417 --> 30:15.121
This morning, you
were contacted in your office.

30:15.155 --> 30:19.392
You said something
about a child Observer.

30:22.479 --> 30:26.131
He is important
to the fugitives.

30:26.150 --> 30:28.818
Why is he important
to them?

30:28.852 --> 30:33.406
What is his purpose?

30:33.440 --> 30:37.310
Why does a child
worry you so much?

30:37.344 --> 30:42.081
He is merely
a curiosity,

30:42.115 --> 30:45.201
and you are mistaken
about him.

30:45.235 --> 30:47.353
He is no child.

30:49.923 --> 30:54.594
He is a chromosomal mistake.
A genetic anomaly.

30:54.628 --> 31:00.516
Designate:
Progeny XB-6783746.

31:00.551 --> 31:05.021
Like all anomalies, he
was scheduled to be destroyed.

31:08.725 --> 31:11.911
But he went missing.

31:11.945 --> 31:16.399
It was a great mystery
in my time.

31:16.450 --> 31:20.570
No one knew
what became of him...

31:22.256 --> 31:23.856
until now.

31:26.577 --> 31:29.545
I would very much
like to meet him.

31:29.580 --> 31:33.049
Tell me where he is.

31:34.801 --> 31:36.168
<i>Captain Windmark?</i>

31:37.537 --> 31:39.555
<i>There's no sign</i>
<i>of anyone else here.</i>

31:45.211 --> 31:49.599
Then I will have to resort
to a deeper extraction.

31:53.987 --> 31:56.072
Why?

31:56.106 --> 31:58.824
"Why?"

31:58.859 --> 32:02.278
Why are you
not frightened?

32:02.329 --> 32:06.732
Do you know why you
tilt your head in that way?

32:06.750 --> 32:10.002
It's an involuntary reflex
in your physiology.

32:10.037 --> 32:15.141
It changes the angle at which
sound waves hit the eardrum,

32:15.175 --> 32:18.844
allowing in more stimuli.

32:18.879 --> 32:21.464
Like a lizard.

32:22.766 --> 32:25.084
I've studied them too.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.587
Intriguing characters.

32:28.605 --> 32:32.642
Their brains have evolved
over 320 million years,

32:32.693 --> 32:38.648
yet for all their evolution,
they form no bonds.

32:38.699 --> 32:41.784
Love does not exist
for them.

32:44.154 --> 32:47.290
They are incapable
of dreaming,

32:47.324 --> 32:50.242
of contemplating beauty,

32:50.277 --> 32:54.780
of knowing something
greater than themselves,

32:54.798 --> 32:58.701
not unlike your kind.

33:00.170 --> 33:03.823
The experiments we conducted
right here in this lab,

33:03.857 --> 33:07.259
yielded
a surprising result,

33:07.293 --> 33:12.231
because for all your years
of evolution,

33:12.265 --> 33:17.970
you inadvertently redeveloped
and honed primitive instincts

33:17.988 --> 33:23.943
that we moved beyond
long ago.

33:23.977 --> 33:30.199
So in reality,
<i>you're</i> the animal.

33:44.031 --> 33:46.382
Restrain her.

34:07.571 --> 34:11.056
You cannot hurt me
with that.

34:13.409 --> 34:16.128
I know.

34:31.094 --> 34:33.964
Walter, maybe you should
stay in the van.

34:34.014 --> 34:36.181
I'm coming with you.

35:40.414 --> 35:43.833
Nina?

36:37.254 --> 36:39.139
They've got the boy.

36:42.510 --> 36:45.261
Who knows
what they'll do to him.

37:21.048 --> 37:25.051
What did he do to her?

37:29.890 --> 37:32.192
Where's she going?

37:59.503 --> 38:02.255
She stopped Windmark
from reading her.

38:03.591 --> 38:09.095
To protect us.
To protect the plan.

38:16.270 --> 38:18.438
And to protect the boy.

38:18.472 --> 38:21.524
They left without him.
He's still here.

38:21.575 --> 38:23.076
Michael?

38:23.110 --> 38:25.778
<i>Michael?</i>

38:28.032 --> 38:30.617
Michael, you can come out now!
It's safe!

38:32.319 --> 38:33.920
<i>Michael!</i>

38:36.257 --> 38:37.874
Michael?

38:52.673 --> 38:54.607
Michael.

38:54.642 --> 38:56.392
Peter!

39:04.618 --> 39:07.737
You all right?

39:09.790 --> 39:11.958
It's okay.

39:11.992 --> 39:14.627
Michael?

39:43.023 --> 39:46.326
He's crying.

40:15.939 --> 40:17.590
You ready?

40:17.608 --> 40:19.809
Yeah.

40:32.339 --> 40:36.909
If you understand me,
touch your nose.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.417
<i>Good.</i>

40:44.451 --> 40:46.452
That's very good.

40:46.470 --> 40:50.840
Do you remember meeting me
a long time ago,

40:50.891 --> 40:54.260
with a man named Donald?

40:59.650 --> 41:03.653
He does.
He remembers.

41:03.687 --> 41:08.274
Do you know why
I needed you for my plan?

41:09.526 --> 41:13.162
Can you tell me
why you are important?

42:00.210 --> 42:04.497
The boy is important.
He has to live.

42:52.405 --> 42:54.456
What happened?

42:56.292 --> 42:58.961
I know who Donald is.

43:01.888 --> 43:05.557
Donald is September.
