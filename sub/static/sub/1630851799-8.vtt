07:27.522 --> 07:28.688
but it was all business social.

07:28.765 --> 07:31.024
- But it was business,
and it was probably

07:31.100 --> 07:32.275
more of what he wanted.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.195

all of what he wanted.

to come--

11:06.908 --> 11:09.409
she said she really...
- Is too nervous.

11:09.485 --> 11:10.618
- Is too nervous.

11:10.695 --> 11:12.161
- Maybe that's why,
'cause I texted her

11:12.172 --> 11:13.171
and I didn't hear back.

11:13.248 --> 11:15.665
- You got the wrong number.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.342
She changed her number.

11:17.419 --> 11:19.794

11:19.871 --> 11:22.422

that Kim and I are okay,

are talking to Kathy.

this was supposed to happen.

12:00.295 --> 12:02.220
- Kim said that?
- Mm-hmm.

12:02.297 --> 12:04.338

We should do a lunch or dinner

30:54.687 --> 30:56.177
I didn't know you were coming.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.638
I'm moving.
Excuse me.

30:58.715 --> 31:00.023
- All right.
We got to eat.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.100
- Oh, my God,
this is exciting, Harry.

31:02.177 --> 31:04.027
- This is really good.
Wow.

31:04.104 --> 31:05.645
- Is Delilah still in Europe?

31:05.722 --> 31:07.364
- No, she's in Tulum right now.

31:07.441 --> 31:08.815
- And where is Amelia?

31:08.892 --> 31:12.694
- Amelia is here,
and will go to Cabo tomorrow

31:12.705 --> 31:14.538
and meet them,
because we will not.

31:14.615 --> 31:16.540
But she's gonna go. because--

31:16.617 --> 31:18.658
- Yeah, no,
it's not appropriate,

31:18.735 --> 31:21.870
for me, at my age--
ripe old age--

31:21.881 --> 31:23.997
subject myself to the virus.

31:24.074 --> 31:26.550
- The plan for Thanksgiving
this year was for Harry and I

31:26.627 --> 31:27.834
to meet the girls in Cabo.

31:27.911 --> 31:29.553
<i> But we were afraid,</i>

31:29.630 --> 31:31.171
because of the COVID surges,

31:31.247 --> 31:33.048
<i> that we would get to Cabo</i>

31:33.058 --> 31:34.057
and they'd shut the border down

31:34.134 --> 31:35.392
and I wouldn't get back.

31:35.469 --> 31:38.395
We decided that
we should stay here.

31:38.472 --> 31:41.565
And if Amelia wants to go,
it's okay.

31:41.642 --> 31:44.017
<i> So, this is the first time</i>
<i> I won't be spending</i>

31:44.094 --> 31:45.736
Thanksgiving,
not only with the girls,

31:45.812 --> 31:47.070
but with Lois.

31:48.932 --> 31:50.023
- No, she's not.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.224
She's going by herself.

31:51.301 --> 31:53.026
Dorit, we're talking
about Scott Disick.

31:53.103 --> 31:54.152
- Oh.
- Anyway.

31:54.229 --> 31:56.079
- Mazel tov or no?
- He's too damn old.

31:56.156 --> 31:57.238
- I know!
- He's old.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.907
- And he's got three kids.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.659
That is not a good match.

32:00.735 --> 32:03.462
- I don't ask a lot
of questions right now.

32:05.165 --> 32:06.998
- Oh, my mom would
have riddled me.

32:07.075 --> 32:08.091
- No, I know.

32:08.168 --> 32:09.760
- My husband's
20 years older than me,

32:09.836 --> 32:11.670
and we met when I was 20.

32:11.746 --> 32:14.598
But Rob and I
are the exception.

32:14.675 --> 32:16.216
- Would I want
that for one of my daughters?

32:16.292 --> 32:17.643
<i> No.</i>

32:18.962 --> 32:20.053
Pick on someone your own size.

32:20.130 --> 32:21.179
- Guess what?

32:21.256 --> 32:23.682
We all fall in love
with older men.

32:23.758 --> 32:24.683
<i> But here's the truth.</i>

32:24.759 --> 32:26.059
Amelia's having a good time.

32:26.136 --> 32:28.779
I'm having a bad time.
Whatever, it's life.

32:28.855 --> 32:29.947
That's the way it goes.

32:30.023 --> 32:33.733
- There's a lot coming,
you know, at us.

32:33.810 --> 32:35.118
And I'm just
being easy with it.

32:35.195 --> 32:36.736
<i> Last ----ing week, the tabloid</i>

32:36.813 --> 32:39.531
had them in the corner,
engaged.

32:39.607 --> 32:40.699
Really?

32:40.775 --> 32:42.701
The press stuff
that's coming is, like,

32:42.777 --> 32:44.619
holy guacamole.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.705
My mom saw it at the market

32:46.781 --> 32:48.581
and called me, and said,

32:48.658 --> 32:50.125
"Is this true?"

32:50.135 --> 32:52.919
<i> I'm like, "Mom, no."</i>

32:52.996 --> 32:54.754
But, I mean,
that's what we're dealing with.

32:54.831 --> 32:56.089
- Do you ask
a lot of questions?

32:56.166 --> 32:57.307
- How do you feel, Harry,
about this situation?

32:57.384 --> 32:59.300
- Yeah, how do you feel?
Just tell them, come on.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.645
- My feelings about it--
I must confess,

33:01.722 --> 33:04.889
the issue that's the most
enduring is the age difference,

33:04.966 --> 33:06.483
which, to me, is odd.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.985
But then again,
every time I think about it,

33:08.061 --> 33:09.894
I think of myself
and Ursula Andress,

33:09.971 --> 33:13.982
when I was 14 years younger
than she, when we had Dimitri.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.984
So I can't really
complain, right?

33:15.995 --> 33:17.160
- Well, how old were you--

33:17.237 --> 33:18.737
- I mean, you could,
but we won't listen.

33:18.813 --> 33:20.831
- When you had Dimitri?
- I was--I was 29.

33:20.907 --> 33:23.834
- You were 29.
- She was 44 when she had him.

33:23.910 --> 33:25.577
- Wow.
<i> - You don't think about that</i>

33:25.653 --> 33:26.745
<i> when you have kids, you know?</i>

33:26.821 --> 33:27.829
<i> That's not</i>
<i> your thought process.</i>

33:27.840 --> 33:28.913
Like, "Oh, this is
gonna come back

33:28.990 --> 33:30.999
to haunt me 100,000 times."

33:31.010 --> 33:32.083
You don't think about that.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.793
- Now that I have dined,

33:33.870 --> 33:35.178
I'm gonna leave you guys to it.

33:35.255 --> 33:36.254
- Thank you so much.

33:36.331 --> 33:37.848
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Harry.

33:37.924 --> 33:39.516
- Lovely to see all of you.
- Thank you, too.

33:39.593 --> 33:40.759
Happy Thanksgiving.

33:40.835 --> 33:42.594
- Happy Thanksgiving.
Thank you.

33:42.670 --> 33:44.679
- Harry's the best.
- This was so yummy.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.856
- You want another bowl of it?

33:45.932 --> 33:47.015
- I want to take it home.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.066
- Okay.

33:49.385 --> 33:51.028
- I know.

33:51.104 --> 33:52.029
- Bring it out.

33:52.105 --> 33:53.772
He'll put it in front of her.

33:53.848 --> 33:56.649
We'll sing "Happy Birthday."

33:56.726 --> 33:58.860
- Oh, you ate all of yours.
- I did too.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.987
- ♪ Happy birthday ♪

34:01.064 --> 34:06.618
all: ♪ To you,
happy birthday to you ♪

34:06.694 --> 34:12.665
♪ Happy birthday,

34:12.742 --> 34:18.630

34:18.706 --> 34:20.131
- We can't blow them
out these days.

34:20.208 --> 34:21.892
I'm gonna use
your holder, Kathy.

34:21.968 --> 34:23.051
- Make a wish.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.728
- I want him hung like a horse.

34:24.805 --> 34:27.856
[all screaming and laughing]

34:29.309 --> 34:33.737
- Whoo!
- It's the truth.

34:33.814 --> 34:36.073
- Whoo!
- Be careful what you wish for.

34:36.149 --> 34:38.700
- Okay, I don't even know
where I'd put it.

34:39.769 --> 34:42.621
- I did not know that
she liked horseback riding.

34:44.083 --> 34:47.033
- But thank you so much.
I want to say I really,

34:47.110 --> 34:49.410
truly appreciate
that you guys are doing this.

34:49.421 --> 34:52.413
Thank you.
Especially you.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.924
'Cause we've known each other
for a long time.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.260
- A long time.
- And I appreciate that.

34:57.337 --> 34:59.096
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:59.172 --> 35:00.922
<i> - In the last year,</i>
<i> Rinna and I</i>

35:00.933 --> 35:03.767
have had a really rocky road
in trying to figure out

35:03.844 --> 35:05.718
<i> if we're gonna have</i>
<i> a friendship,</i>

35:05.795 --> 35:07.270
<i> what that friendship's</i>
<i> gonna look like,</i>

35:07.347 --> 35:09.764
and her making an effort
for my birthday

35:09.775 --> 35:12.267
means something, for sure.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.893
- G.
- Yes.

35:13.970 --> 35:16.271
- A few gifts. This is--
- Oh, come on, you guys.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.281
- This is from me.
I don't know who this is from.

35:18.358 --> 35:20.692
Dadgummit,
I didn't bring a present.

35:20.768 --> 35:22.944
They brought presents.

35:22.955 --> 35:26.739
- Guys, Garcelle's not here.
I'm having a cake.

35:26.816 --> 35:27.907
- We're giving her a cake,

35:27.984 --> 35:29.742
just to acknowledge
her birthday.

35:29.819 --> 35:31.369
- But if you want to bring
presents, bring presents.

35:31.446 --> 35:32.629
- Yeah.

35:32.706 --> 35:34.080
- That's from Crystal,
Kathy, and me.

35:34.157 --> 35:35.757
- Yay, happy birthday.

35:37.210 --> 35:38.969
- What's in here?
- Open.

35:39.045 --> 35:42.380
- My God, what could this be?

35:42.457 --> 35:44.641
- Oh.
- Something expensive.

35:44.718 --> 35:46.467
- Gorgeous.
- Yeah!

35:46.478 --> 35:48.311
- Let me see.
Let me see.

35:48.388 --> 35:49.312
- Wow.
- Wait.

35:49.389 --> 35:50.430
Should I do it like this?

35:50.506 --> 35:51.931
- Yes!
- Yes!

35:52.008 --> 35:53.817
- That is beautiful.
- You guys!

35:53.894 --> 35:55.819
- I love that shape.

35:55.896 --> 35:57.979
- Crystal, I was
admiring this from you.

35:57.990 --> 35:58.980
- It's the three of us,
the three of us.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.640
- Oh, did you have this?

36:00.717 --> 36:03.985
- She mentioned she liked it,
and it's been stuck in my head.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.278
- It's really pretty.

36:05.355 --> 36:07.330
- It's gorgeous.
- Thank you so much.

36:07.407 --> 36:10.834
- You're very welcome.

36:10.911 --> 36:12.243
- I'm sliding down
for a second.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.671
One second.
- I did not expect this.

36:14.748 --> 36:15.914
This is really nice.

36:15.990 --> 36:17.415
- Yay, I love a surprise.
- I know.

36:17.492 --> 36:19.718
- I love a surprise.

36:31.932 --> 36:37.360
- No. No, I leave tomorrow.

36:37.437 --> 36:39.938
It's my last night
with my kids.

36:40.014 --> 36:41.198
- Lisa and Erika.
- That's right.

36:41.274 --> 36:44.201
- Ooh.

36:44.277 --> 36:46.527
- Ooh, that's good.
- Oh, it's got a little--

36:46.538 --> 36:48.288
- It has a little
sleeve action.

37:01.294 --> 37:02.368
<i> - Coming up:</i>

37:02.446 --> 37:05.046
- What crazy planet
do you live on?

37:05.057 --> 37:06.139
- Not yours.

37:12.546 --> 37:14.222
- Ooh.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.233
- Ooh, that's good.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.323
- Okay.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.200
- Who is this from?

37:34.277 --> 37:35.326
- That's from me, baby.

37:35.403 --> 37:36.503
- That's from Dorit, I believe.
- Yes.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.482
- Why do you want to go home?

37:40.484 --> 37:42.542
- My puppy's coming.
- No, it's not the puppy.

37:42.618 --> 37:44.502
Tell me the truth.
What happened that I missed?

37:44.579 --> 37:46.212
- Nothing happened.

37:46.289 --> 37:48.098
- Why don't you tell me
the truth? We're friends.

37:52.012 --> 37:56.606
- I have a very difficult time
being fake.

37:56.683 --> 37:59.183
It's hard to sit
across the table from somebody

37:59.260 --> 38:01.019
who obviously doesn't like me,

38:01.095 --> 38:03.521
<i> who's been talking badly</i>
<i> about me behind my back,</i>

38:03.598 --> 38:06.950
and who's looking at me
quite smugly, to be honest.

38:07.027 --> 38:08.860
I don't want to look
at her face anymore.

38:08.936 --> 38:12.030
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing happened. I'm just--

38:12.106 --> 38:13.239
- Well, you're being--
you're saying you don't like

38:13.316 --> 38:14.365
being fake.
- There is no resolution

38:14.442 --> 38:16.034
in all of this, and I'm--

38:16.110 --> 38:17.627
it's wearing at me.

38:17.704 --> 38:19.412
- You mean with Crystal?
- Yeah.

38:19.489 --> 38:20.505
- You still feel weird.

38:22.617 --> 38:23.633
- Yeah.

38:23.710 --> 38:27.253
[all speaking at once]

38:27.330 --> 38:28.421
- I love mine so much.

38:28.498 --> 38:30.590
- Who will I wear it for?
- Yummy.

38:30.666 --> 38:32.216
- Thank you, Dorit.

38:32.293 --> 38:34.969
<i> - She's talked about me</i>
<i> behind my back to everybody.</i>

38:34.980 --> 38:37.055
I've tried to say my piece.

38:37.131 --> 38:39.524
she's never apologized to me.

38:41.135 --> 38:43.987
And I'm--like, I've had it.

38:44.064 --> 38:45.646
<i> - This is not the Sutton</i>
<i> that I know,</i>

38:45.657 --> 38:48.658
when she's being
extremely emotional,

38:48.735 --> 38:51.235
and quite frankly irrational.

38:51.312 --> 38:52.945
- I am not over

38:53.022 --> 38:55.448
being told that
I violated someone.

38:55.525 --> 38:57.408
- I understand that.
- Then I need to go.

38:57.485 --> 38:58.910
- No, you don't need to go.
- Yes.

38:58.986 --> 39:00.119
- No. You don't have to be
friends with her,

39:00.196 --> 39:01.412
but you're friends
with all of us.

39:01.489 --> 39:02.580
- She said that I violated her!
- Oh, my God.

39:02.657 --> 39:03.998
- Are they having a fight?

39:04.009 --> 39:05.508
- I feel like I hear
somebody screaming.

39:05.585 --> 39:08.011
- I felt like I heard that too.

39:08.088 --> 39:09.921
- Okay, but she also
said to me--

39:09.997 --> 39:11.255
just listen for a second.
- Mm-hmm.

39:11.332 --> 39:14.300
- She also said to me,
"I did not mean sexually,"

39:14.377 --> 39:15.927
she said,
"But I did feel violated."

39:16.003 --> 39:17.095
- She's a ---ing liar.

39:17.171 --> 39:18.471
- It was made out like it was,

39:18.548 --> 39:20.014
like, a sexual, weird thing.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.358
- Yeah, but that word

39:21.434 --> 39:22.675
never came up from me.

39:22.752 --> 39:24.602
- Let's have drinks
for Garcelle's birthday.

39:24.679 --> 39:26.196
- Let's do it.
[all speaking at once]

39:26.272 --> 39:27.939
- We got to do shots.
- Let's do shots!

39:28.015 --> 39:29.190
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah!

39:29.201 --> 39:31.275
all: Shots! Shots!
Shots! Shots!

39:31.352 --> 39:32.610
- What can I make you,
a margarita?

39:32.687 --> 39:33.703
- I want to make sure
you're okay.

39:33.780 --> 39:34.871
I don't need that
as much as I need--
