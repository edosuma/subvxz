00:05.200 --> 00:09.159
I was between meetings. I just wanted
to know if you were free for some lunch.

00:09.240 --> 00:13.358
I'd be freer if Ramona was around,
but I can make you something if you like.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.158
No, no, I'm fine.

00:15.240 --> 00:21.195
Look, I was wondering erm...if you wanted to
go away one night when David's got the kids.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.516
What did you have in mind?

00:23.600 --> 00:26.114
Just this hotel. It's supposed
to be fantastic.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.998
I just haven't had the chance to try it yet.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.390
Well, Wednesday's my free night.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.436
Yes, I know.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.353
You've already booked it, haven't you?
- Now, would I be so presumptuous?

00:42.440 --> 00:44.590
Yeah. You would.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.797
I'll pick you up at 6:00, then. Bye-bye.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.279
Bye-bye.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.356
Hi. I'm back.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.916
Hello?

01:00.120 --> 01:02.839
Oh, my God.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.391
Josh, will you put that back?

01:06.480 --> 01:09.119
Do you have another card?
- Not on me, no.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.510
Is there a problem?
- It's been rejected three times.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.354
That can't be right.
- What about cash?

01:16.440 --> 01:20.831
Not for that much. Josh, will you put
that back? I've got 40 pounds on me.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.230
Well, I suppose you could pick out
what you can afford.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.834
No. Can you just try again, please?

01:26.920 --> 01:30.390
I've tried three times.
- Thank you very much for your help.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.436
Josh, come on!

01:36.840 --> 01:39.354
Robyn.
- Mmm?

01:42.120 --> 01:44.031
Have you ever done this before?

01:44.120 --> 01:46.759
Sex?
- No.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.830
With a client.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.871
No. No, it's not something
The Law Society encourages.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.398
Then why me?

02:01.800 --> 02:04.189
I don't know.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.192
Maybe...

02:08.240 --> 02:11.471
Maybe because of all the men
I usually meet...

02:11.560 --> 02:14.120
you're the only one who would
ask that question.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.400 --> 02:30.437
Karen.
To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?

02:30.520 --> 02:33.512
Cut the crap, David.
What do you think you're playing at?

02:33.600 --> 02:35.431
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.397
My credit card's been cancelled.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.914
That's very prompt.
- What?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.913
I don't think you should have
unrestricted access to my funds.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.911
Your funds?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.912
Yeah. Look, I intend to give you
an allowance, Karen.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.877
And for the children as well.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.030
200 pounds a week seems more than fair.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.759
Although I have to check that
with my solicitor.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.149
David!
- Yep. She agrees.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.515
What, you're with her now?
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.431
We're in conference.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.317
Is there anything else?

03:05.480 --> 03:07.436
No.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.999
I'm just waiting for Adam.
I don't know where they are.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.957
Phone him.
- I did. All morning.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.112
I've worn his battery out.
- Found it hard to let go?

03:19.200 --> 03:23.034
At first, although it's worrying
how quickly you adapt.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.715
Someone's got to present a campaign
to their board. You'll want to?

03:26.800 --> 03:28.950
Oh, my God.
- What?

03:29.040 --> 03:32.919
I've just realised it's over an hour
since I've even thought about Matthew.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.316
Anyway, I'm missing him now.
I don't know where they are.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.875
Right, what are you having?
- My shout. Yours when you find work.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.758
Not only unemployed, but patronised as well.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.912
Two pints, please, mate.
- Sorry, you can't bring that in here.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.879
That?

03:51.960 --> 03:53.598
That is my son.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.672
Yeah. And this is my pub.
And he ain't allowed.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.479
And what do you expect me to do with him?

03:59.560 --> 04:02.597
Leave it at home with his mum?
- That is typical.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.910
I don't care, mate. He's barred.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.990
There you go.
- Barred? He's only four months old.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.036
Nice one. Took me 18 years.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.156
We just don't cater for children
in this country.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.232
Where are the changing facilities?
- Adam, it's a pub.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.799
He still needs changing.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.319
Now, by the smell of him.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.958
Haven't got any nappies.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.715
Need to do a shop on the way home.
- Is this what your life's come to?

04:35.520 --> 04:37.556
How was the immigration interview?

04:39.360 --> 04:42.591
I blew it completely.
- I'm sure you didn't.

04:42.680 --> 04:47.196
I was sitting there, listening to myself,
thinking, ''I wouldn't believe this.''

04:47.280 --> 04:51.956
I mean, visa runs out,
weeks later pops the question.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.076
No. It's not gonna look good on paper.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.277
Adam, do you think Jo married me for a visa?

04:57.360 --> 05:00.909
It certainly wasn't for your looks.
- Or my money.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.629
But you did get married for the right
reasons, so I'm sure they can tell.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.790
Do you reckon?
- Yes.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.759
I mean... do Pete and I really love
each other that much,

05:10.840 --> 05:15.391
or were we just thrown together
by circumstance?

05:15.480 --> 05:17.277
Makes you think, though.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.397
Ah, away with you.
I'm sure she's nuts about you.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.916
I've been a bit daft, haven't I?
- Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.037
Though some women might
find that attractive.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.190
So what happens now?
- Wait for the letter.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.633
See if she's in or she's out.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.554
Right. Are we off?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.557
Adam!

05:45.640 --> 05:47.517
Argh!

05:47.600 --> 05:49.556
Sorry.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.596
On you come.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.158
At last! Where have you been?

05:56.240 --> 05:59.869
I tell you,
they've got very good changing facilities.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.916
Bit small, but very clean.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.434
Oh, sweetheart. Hello!

06:08.840 --> 06:11.638
So, how was your day?

06:11.720 --> 06:13.233
Good.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.673
Fine.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.832
What's for dinner?
- Chicken Kiev.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.390
Hello. Right, I'll take him up,
get him a bath and put him to bed.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.675
Don't you want to get the meal on first?

06:24.760 --> 06:27.320
Me? I've been to work all day.
- I've been a parent.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.960
And I'm about to take him up
and put him to bed.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.076
Because you want to.
- So?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.752
So I want to sit on my arse.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.990
No, Adam, it doesn't work like that.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.959
I bring home the bacon, you have to cook it
and clean up after it.

06:40.040 --> 06:44.113
What? - It seemed to work OK
while you were working.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.113
That's right. Have a dig.
- Come on. I'm tired.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.316
Yeah, well, I'm exhausted.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.153
This isn't a competition.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.114
Takeaway.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.475
OK.
- I'll cook tomorrow night.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.357
Oh, no. I'm not going to be here.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.670
Some awards do, I suppose.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.799
No, I've got to go to bloody Milan.
Looking at a client's factory.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.077
Leaving me holding the baby?
- That's your job.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.152
I don't have a job,
as you seem intent on reminding me.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.710
It's just for one night
and Howard thinks it would be useful.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.472
Who in the holy shite is Howard?

07:21.560 --> 07:24.472
Howard is the client. We're going together.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.471
This gets better. Adjoining rooms?

07:26.560 --> 07:30.348
You used to go away to work all the time.
I didn't mind.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.238
In computing,
the computers were sexier than the women.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.989
Howard is 50,
he looks like Danny DeVito and he's gay.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.672
Does that make you feel any better?

07:42.400 --> 07:43.628
A little.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.676
Good. Because I'm hungry.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.393
It was just sex for its own sake, Pete.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.950
It was shallow and sordid,
if you stop to think about it.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.395
Which I didn't.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.790
I'm just not used to attractive women
coming on to me like that.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.110
I went along with it.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.156
Twice.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.550
When you rang me, you said there was
a problem you wanted to discuss.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.789
Yeah.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.633
Can we get to it, please?
I think my tea's nearly ready.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.835
This is the problem.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.273
What?

08:19.360 --> 08:23.239
That you had no-strings sex
with a fully-consenting, attractive woman?

08:23.320 --> 08:26.596
Yeah, but...
- But nothing.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.716
Cor, life is wasted on some people.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.315
David, you're allowed to enjoy yourself
before you die.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.313
So you think I should go for it?

08:36.400 --> 08:38.595
You have a duty to.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.557
On behalf of the rest of mankind.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.671
Ooh. Ooh, yeah.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.718
Ooh. No.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.678
Ooh, that's nice.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.910
No.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.428
I'm sorry.
- Oh. It's OK, Karen.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.351
You know Lee, don't you?
- Hello.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.956
Hi, Karen. Erm... I'll just use your
bathroom if that's all right.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.473
Yeah, sure.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.949
And er...then you go. OK?

09:18.440 --> 09:19.759
Quick!

09:19.840 --> 09:21.796
Come here.

09:23.040 --> 09:27.716
I think he was surprised that when I
invited him in for coffee, he get coffee.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.349
He can stay the night if you want.
- No, I don't want him to.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.150
I'm a good Catholic girl.
- Ramona, it's me. Karen.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.994
OK. Listen, he is such a flirt.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.992
He's always...with all the women.

09:43.080 --> 09:47.198
I think if I...too quickly, he's gonna...

09:47.280 --> 09:53.150
So instead I'm going to treat him mean,
keep him enthusiastic.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.713
Do you not think that's a slightly
risky tactic?

09:57.800 --> 10:01.076
Karen, it's me. Ramona.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.993
I'm going to play him like a fish.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.358
And believe me, when I land him,
he no want to go back in the water.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.598
I don't need to go yet.
- No?

10:19.680 --> 10:22.194
But I want to go to bed.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.719
Thank you for my present.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.358
Oh, yeah. Right.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.112
Maybe you'll wear it some time.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.435
Maybe I am.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.589
<i>Right. Flight details and
hotel are up there.</i>

10:49.680 --> 10:53.673
I'll have my mobile with me. Here's
a list of things you might like to do.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.514
These are things you need to do.
Washing, ironing, hoovering.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.477
Do you know where we keep the hoover?

10:59.560 --> 11:03.519
Rachel, if we're going to swap
roles, I get to nag.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.831
That's my cab. Bye-bye, my love.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.390
Oh, God.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.313
Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.
Tomorrow teatime.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.914
I'll make sure I have it ready for you.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.434
Hey!

11:18.520 --> 11:19.714
I've got a new video.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.588
You've got a new video, have you? Great.
We'll look at that in a minute.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.833
Hi. There you are.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.151
Oh, thank you so much.
Is that my spending money?

11:37.320 --> 11:39.356
You could always go back to work.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.477
Mark gave you a job before.
I'm sure he'd be willing again.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.348
Are you intending to sell the house
from under me as well?

11:46.440 --> 11:50.149
I haven't decided what to do yet.
It's difficult when you don't know its value.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.319
That was very childish, Karen.
- And stopping my credit card wasn't?

11:56.640 --> 12:00.474
If you need me, I'll be on my mobile.
Mark and I are going away for the night.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.632
To a hotel.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.676
Well, I trust he's paying.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.512
Pete?

12:15.600 --> 12:17.591
Hey! Ramona.
- Hello.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.238
I didn't expect to see you.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.594
In a fitness club?

12:20.680 --> 12:24.912
Jo invited me.
I'd rather be at home with my feet up.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.437
You're a member here?
- Yeah. Oh and er...I know Lee.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.593
I know his type.
Fancies the arse off himself. So do they.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.274
I bet he has the pick of the women.
- Yeah?

12:36.360 --> 12:39.193
What about Jo and her men's members, then?

12:41.360 --> 12:43.032
He's on the prowl. Watch out.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.190
Hi, gorgeous.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.759
Hi.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.398
Lee.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.835
Do you want another drink?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.388
Yeah, but I'd better stay on the juice.
- OK.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.629
You're Pete, right? Jo's old man.

12:57.720 --> 13:01.872
Er... Yeah. How did you work that one out?
- She described you.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.757
Oh, really?

13:03.840 --> 13:07.992
So, what's it like being married to her?
- Tough, but someone's got to do it.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.275
Yeah. She begged me once.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.998
Really?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.991
I told her I'm not the marrying kind.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.479
Really.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.999
She was joking.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.753
Hi. It's going quite well.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.073
Are you all right?
- Yeah.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.634
Here you are, mate. Thanks a lot.
- Cheers.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.196
Blimey. I never want to go home.

13:50.280 --> 13:54.432
We've only been here five minutes.
- Yep. And I don't want to go home.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.358
Did you see the hot tub in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

13:58.440 --> 14:03.389
They've also got one in the health spa.
And apparently...they've got a heated pool.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.152
What time's dinner?

14:06.200 --> 14:08.839
8:00.
- Make it 9:00.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.558
Why is that, then?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.795
Fancy a swim?

14:13.880 --> 14:15.836
No.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.034
Finally.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.875
Hello, sweetheart, it's me.
Is that Matthew I can hear?

15:10.920 --> 15:12.433
Yes. Shh.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.432
He should really be in bed by now, love.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.080
Yeah. So how's Milan?

15:18.160 --> 15:20.515
It's fine. You know, it's a city.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.433
An Italian city. Not quite Manchester.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.039
Enjoying the sights?

15:27.120 --> 15:31.989
Well, they did take me for a tour after we'd
had lunch in this little trattoria. It was nice.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.549
What about tonight? Clubbing?
Business class flight home tomorrow?

15:39.160 --> 15:41.720
So how's your day been?
What have you been up to?

15:41.800 --> 15:44.519
Oh, er...

15:47.680 --> 15:48.954
Eh-oh.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.110
Good boy. Come on.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.469
Ah, lovely.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.394
Bed indeed.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.038
Come on.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.078
Nice. Thanks very much.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.957
There's Tinky Winky.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.273
He's gay.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.918
Nothing really.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.710
That's Howard. We're going out for dinner.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.756
I shall see you tomorrow.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.798
I can't wait.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.189
Right, bye.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.236
I'll bet.

16:26.960 --> 16:31.112
I thought we might go away this weekend.
Stay in a hotel somewhere.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.668
I thought it might be fun.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.909
Josh?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.911
Hang on, Robyn. I'll call you back.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.629
Karen, we'd better get a move on.
They stop serving food at 10:00.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.597
Quite frankly, I'm starving.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.991
Please don't answer that.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.877
Karen, don't answer it, please.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.037
Hello?
- Karen, it's David.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.798
What?
- It's Josh.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.868
Are you gonna be silent the whole way?

17:04.960 --> 17:07.076
I'm concentrating on the driving.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.839
I don't understand why we've
got to come back.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.469
He dislocated his elbow.
- Yeah, which is now reset.

17:15.560 --> 17:19.553
He's going to feel a little bit sore
and not want to sleep on the top bunk again.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.832
I don't understand
why we had to change our plans.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.109
I'm sorry,
but I want to be there when he wakes up.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.037
I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself anyway.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.395
Yeah, don't think that didn't
occur to David.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.357
What?

17:35.440 --> 17:40.309
Josh wasn't kept in hospital.
David didn't really need to call, did he?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.709
He just wanted to ruin our night.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.995
Sorry, but now you're being paranoid.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.514
Next you'll be saying David pushed him.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.789
Oh, for God's sake. Just drive.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.752
Yes, dear.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.873
Thank you for my lift.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

18:06.960 --> 18:10.873
Don't I even get invited in for coffee now?
- Yeah, if you want to.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.678
Look.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.591
I'm nuts about you.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.114
You're fun. Sexy.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.997
You're way smarter than me.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.799
But I'm feeling like I'm 15 again.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.711
I don't have a clue where I stand.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.552
You've got to give me some hope here.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.073
But I did.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.718
I said I'll see you tomorrow.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.477
Tomorrow morning.
When you serve me breakfast.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.873
Bastard. Machine's eaten my card.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.030
Have you forgotten your number?

18:50.120 --> 18:52.509
''Insufficient funds.''

18:52.600 --> 18:55.910
Well, you'd better ask your missus
for some more housekeeping.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.468
Shouldn't you be at work?
- Yep.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.831
Look, lend us a tenner, will you?

19:06.160 --> 19:09.118
Actually, best make it 50. Come on.
- Eh?

19:10.200 --> 19:11.553
Ta, fella.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.835
Right, I'll see you later.
- See you.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.433
Adam, do you think Jo married me
to get a visa?

19:20.480 --> 19:21.799
Peter, we have done this.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.791
I know, but this bloke she works with

19:23.880 --> 19:27.077
said that Jo asked him to marry her
before she went back to Oz.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.355
You're joking.
- No, he said she was.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.398
But when he turned her down,
she would say she was joking.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.630
Well, of course it was a joke.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.597
I'm gonna have it out with her.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.671
Make sure you have some evidence.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.035
Systems analyst? I'm perfect for this.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.554
Look, don't go back to work.
- I'm not.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.916
Look after him. I have an interview.
- I've got something to do.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.389
Pete, I can get this.
- I'm sorry, Adam. I can't.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.470
Jo? Are you here?

21:11.760 --> 21:13.239
Bingo.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.319
Hi. Adam Williams.
The job agency should have called you.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.789
Yes. Just take a seat over there,
Mr Williams.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.836
Thanks.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.830
Ah. Duncan. How are you?
Oh, God, am I glad to see you.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.753
It's Mr Mum.
- Very droll, Duncan. Very droll.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.912
Look, will you look after him
while I'm in there?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.560
Duncan Courts?
- Sorry, mate.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.716
Good luck.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.795
<i>I've moved in with a friend of a friend.</i>

21:52.880 --> 21:54.552
<i>His name's Pete.</i>

21:54.640 --> 21:58.235
<i>He's not what you'd call a looker,
or I would for that matter.</i>

21:58.320 --> 22:00.276
<i>But he seems harmless enough.</i>

22:02.440 --> 22:04.396
<i>Adam Williams?</i>

22:13.920 --> 22:16.673
Hi.
- Hi.

22:16.760 --> 22:20.548
This doesn't fall within your duties
and I'm not trying to take advantage,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.153
but is there any possibility?

22:24.680 --> 22:26.875
Come on in.
- Thanks.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.191
Excuse the attire
but I've only just found out about the job.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.589
It's what you can do I'm interested in.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.596
Take a seat.
- Thanks.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.313
<i>I held an aerobics class today.</i>

22:42.400 --> 22:46.029
<i>Pete came along,
and this bloke he works with, Suggs.</i>

22:46.120 --> 22:47.758
<i>God, he's gorgeous.</i>

22:48.800 --> 22:52.110
Migrating your existing core systems
to a Unix platform

22:52.200 --> 22:54.236
would save money in software licences,

22:54.320 --> 22:56.834
which could then be spent
upgrading the server.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.390
What the hell is that noise?

23:00.480 --> 23:04.234
The ancillary systems would then follow.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.031
The thing is, he's late for his feed.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.758
Can you just give me a moment?

23:14.360 --> 23:16.669
<i>The poms want to kick me out,</i>

23:16.760 --> 23:19.115
<i>which is a bummer cos I love it here.</i>

23:19.200 --> 23:21.156
<i>I'd do anything to stay.</i>

23:21.240 --> 23:23.196
<i>Any ideas?</i>

23:26.000 --> 23:28.275
He knows when his milk's five minutes late.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.878
Andrew Harris?

23:35.320 --> 23:37.993
Maybe I can go back in afterwards.

23:50.880 --> 23:53.269
Yeah, hello?
- Mark, it's me.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.999
You know you're supposed to be
comlng round at 6:00?

23:56.080 --> 23:59.356
I'm stuck in traffic.
- Do you want me to make it later?

23:59.440 --> 24:01.351
No. Half an hour earlier?

24:01.440 --> 24:06.036
Sorry, but I need someone to look after the kids.
Ramona's got a doctor's appointment.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.519
Can't she change it?

24:07.600 --> 24:10.831
I don't want to ask her.
I think she's having a coil fitted.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.558
Ooh.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.279
Erm, Karen, it's not very convenient, love.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.510
Can't you ask David? He is their father.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.910
Well, I was hoping you might want to help.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.355
It'll only be for half an hour.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.795
Karen, I'm running very late for a meeting.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.599
Fine. Fine.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.636
Er...

24:38.680 --> 24:41.274
If this is to blame me again,
I'm ringing off.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.918
No, it's not.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.518
It's to ask you a favour.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.511
What?

24:48.560 --> 24:51.836
Would you mind looking after the children
for a bit, please?

24:53.720 --> 24:55.119
Sure.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.395
Look. There's Mummy. Wave to Mummy.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.878
Hello!

25:01.960 --> 25:04.758
You've come to meet Mummy.
What a lovely surprise.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.313
Well, surprise, certainly.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.550
Hi. Adam. Rachel's husband.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.835
Oh, hi. Howard Trigg.

25:11.920 --> 25:15.469
Howard. You're looking very well.
Especially for your age.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.039
So what did you go to Milan for?

25:17.120 --> 25:19.588
Cosmetic surgery?
- Thanks for the trip, Howard.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.148
<i>That was brilliant. Shall I ring
you tomorrow?</i>

25:22.240 --> 25:23.878
Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.916
Bye. Thanks for that.

25:28.480 --> 25:31.597
Are you trying to embarrass me?
- Is that possible?

25:31.680 --> 25:33.318
He's not old or ugly.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.073
Nor gay, but it's what you wanted to hear.
- Oh, terrific.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.355
This is what happens, you know.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.112
Wife stays at home with the kids

25:40.200 --> 25:43.351
while the husband's abroad on trips
shagging colleagues.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.635
Howard's not like that.
- I mean you!

25:46.880 --> 25:48.677
Adam, we're in an airport.

25:48.760 --> 25:51.991
Do you not want me to cause a scene?
- No, no, I don't. Not really.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.999
Let's go home. Come on, hup.

26:03.800 --> 26:07.873
David, what an unpleasant surprise.
What are you doing here?

26:08.920 --> 26:10.990
I could ask you the same question.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.399
Moved in, have you?

26:12.480 --> 26:16.393
Moved in? No, no. Baby-sitting your
children. A job you're welcome to.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.277
And by the way, your son...

26:19.720 --> 26:21.073
Insolent little sod.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.116
Tell Karen to call me, would you?

26:28.480 --> 26:30.436
Hello, Joshy. How's it going?

26:35.720 --> 26:37.995
Hey...

26:38.080 --> 26:40.071
Hey, what's up?
- He hurt me, Daddy.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.396
Whoo! Gosh. I'm shagged.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.316
One of your clients, was it?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.069
Jo...

26:54.160 --> 26:56.754
Why did you marry me?

26:56.840 --> 26:58.876
What?

26:58.960 --> 27:03.431
You could have had your pick,
but you chose me. Now, that doesn't happen.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.990
Good-looking birds trade up. Not down.
Unless he's bloody rich.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.998
What are you talking about?
Pete, I love you.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.156
I found this amongst your e-mails.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.314
You'd do anything to stay in this country?

27:20.400 --> 27:23.551
You've been reading my e-mails?
- That's not the issue here!

27:23.640 --> 27:25.995
You were shitting yourself
at that interview.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.958
Immigration could see right through you
and now so can I!

27:29.040 --> 27:31.793
Pete, I didn't mean this.
This is a turn of phrase.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.154
You were messing about.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.515
Like the time you asked Lee
if he'd marry you.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.757
Well, it's another joke at my expense.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.515
Now, I'm going out... and I'll be
staying in my son's bedroom tonight.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.674
Pete!

27:57.400 --> 27:59.356
Thanks for that, David.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.710
I want to talk to you. About Mark.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.995
Well, he'll be here in a minute.

28:09.080 --> 28:11.435
He was when I arrived.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.679
He was abusing Josh.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.553
Don't be ridiculous.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.749
Josh was crying.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.512
Well, Mark probably told him off.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.909
He twisted his arm. The elbow Josh hurt.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.877
I'm sorry. I don't believe that.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.632
Ask him.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.029
He'll say what you want him to say,
won't he?

28:32.080 --> 28:35.516
You're sad, David,
and you just can't stand to see me happy.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.637
My solicitor will ask for an order
keeping Mark away from the kids.

28:38.720 --> 28:42.633
And I will be seeking sole custody of them
after our divorce.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.514
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

28:54.760 --> 28:57.638
I can't do this any more.
I'm sorry. I've tried.

28:58.840 --> 29:01.593
Well, that's fantastic, Adam,
because we have no choice.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.113
I need to get a job.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.430
Go and get one. You're no use
to us like this.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.670
I went for an interview today.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.110
Did anything happen between you and Howard?

29:16.160 --> 29:19.709
Of course it didn't! I'm a happily
married woman.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.872
I'm not happy.
- Do you think this is any easier for me?

29:22.960 --> 29:25.030
Yes. You've just been to friggin' Italy!

29:25.120 --> 29:27.076
Adam, I hated it.

29:27.160 --> 29:31.312
I spent three hours wandering around
a factory that makes widgets.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.915
OK, so we had lunch, but do you know
what the conversation was about?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.594
Widgets.

29:37.680 --> 29:41.468
When I rang you up,
I just wanted to hear your voice.

29:43.720 --> 29:46.632
Last night, I cried myself to sleep.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.676
I missed our son.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.513
Do you want to give up work?

29:58.160 --> 30:01.596
No. I want to be able to do both.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.479
So do I.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.516
I did not twist his arm.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.919
He was throwing a tantrum.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.595
I just tried to restrain him
before he really managed to hurt himself.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.150
But you grabbed the arm that he dislocated.
- Yeah, I forgot. I'm sorry.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.196
I handled it badly.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.436
It comes with practice.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.996
I've done my bit. I...

30:27.400 --> 30:30.949
It's reasons like this
I didn't want to have children of my own.

30:31.040 --> 30:34.316
Yeah, but, Mark, I come with children.
Three of them.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.597
So? My relationship's with you, not them.
On a good day.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.033
What about the future?

30:39.120 --> 30:41.759
In future, we make damn sure
we've got a baby-sitter.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.910
No, I'm being serious.
- Yeah, and so am I.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.399
You are not listening to me.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.950
If you want us to be together,
then you have to accept my children.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.996
I do accept them.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.036
As your own?

30:54.160 --> 30:56.276
Because that is what it would mean.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.037
You see, this isn't going to work.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.076
It is working.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.673
We have fun.

31:07.760 --> 31:12.709
Mark, I need a lot more than fun.
I'm 35. I am not looking for a boyfriend.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.030
I need someone that I can
share my life with.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.278
You know, I never made a secret
of my views on children.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.114
I know. I know.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.395
I just thought that if you got to know them,

31:25.480 --> 31:28.153
if you could spend time with them, that...

31:30.520 --> 31:31.999
I love you.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.719
I can't love them.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.236
Then you don't love me.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.196
You love someone I'm not.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.151
How?

32:05.120 --> 32:07.076
So that's that, then?

32:08.880 --> 32:10.313
We're over.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.712
Unless you want to move in.
Play at being stepdad.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.717
Oh, it doesn't have to end, Karen.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.038
Yeah, it does.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.193
Mrs Gifford?
- Yes.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.919
We're here to check on
your domestic circumstances.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.116
I hope now is not an inconvenient time.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.270
No. Erm, come in.

32:56.200 --> 32:59.510
I don't normally sleep in the spare room.
I just did last night.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.953
We had a row.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.393
But not a serious one.

33:02.480 --> 33:06.473
Erm, serious enough for me to move in here
but nothing terminal.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.279
Oh, you don't think so?
- I don't know.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.669
Anyway, what would you like to see next?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.233
I think we've seen enough.

33:16.080 --> 33:19.356
Yeah. I've never come across
a more convincing marriage.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.595
OK, David. This is about cash and kids.

33:37.680 --> 33:42.071
How much you pay, who takes care of them.
Who has access to them.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.072
Let me do what's necessary
and I can deliver on all three.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.230
It depends how badly you want them.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.316
I want them.
- That's what I wanted to hear.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.788
Thanks for coming in again
at such short notice.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.599
Well, thanks for giving me another chance.

33:59.680 --> 34:03.229
I have to say, I was surprised
to get the call this morning.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.312
But, the baby's asleep
and I'm ready to give it my best shot.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.391
I don't think you understand.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.040
I haven't called you in for
another interview.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.313
You haven't.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.038
You've already got the job.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.996
What?

34:17.080 --> 34:19.992
I just wanted to discuss personal terms.

34:20.080 --> 34:24.630
You mean, that performance yesterday...
I was the best?

34:24.719 --> 34:26.233
No. One of them.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.710
It was my PA's vote that swung it.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.360
She liked the way you were with your child.

34:32.440 --> 34:33.509
Just one thing.

34:33.600 --> 34:38.116
When you start work, you won't be bringing
him in with you, will you?

34:39.880 --> 34:42.474
You know as well as I do,
in a situation such as this,

34:42.560 --> 34:45.393
when both parents
are seeking custody of the children,

34:45.480 --> 34:47.630
nine times out of ten, the mother will win.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.277
We're content with those odds.

34:49.360 --> 34:53.672
On Friday 5th, your client kept the children
overnight without their mother's approval.

34:53.760 --> 34:58.197
On Wednesday 30th, the eldest child, Joshua,
dislocated his elbow whilst in his father's care.

34:58.280 --> 34:59.952
Oh, come on!

35:00.040 --> 35:04.192
I would advise you against any attempt
at character assassination.

35:04.280 --> 35:08.478
Mrs Marsden will tell you herself
what a dangerous tactic that is.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.630
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mrs Marsden.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.551
I didn't mean to upset you.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.519
Perhaps you'd like a drink?
Well, of course you would.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.068
Still, will water do?
- Robyn, that's enough.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.797
This need never come out in open court.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.393
Stop it! Now!

35:24.480 --> 35:27.040
Perhaps now might be a good time
for an adjournment.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.190
A chance to consult with our clients.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.549
I'd like to speak with my wife. Alone.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.710
Let me handle it.
- It's not a good idea.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.712
David, you shouldn't...
- Will you both leave the room, please?

35:49.720 --> 35:51.073
Karen, I'm so sorry.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.277
I'd never allow that to come out in court.
It was just a tactic.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.274
Yeah, and she was...just doing her job.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.559
Just not a very pleasant one.

36:07.120 --> 36:08.872
I'm not seeing Mark any more.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.833
Because he hurt Josh?

36:14.640 --> 36:16.517
No, David, that was an accident.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.556
That's not the reason.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.435
Things just weren't working out.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.833
I'm sorry.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.870
Well, I never like to see you unhappy.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.158
I'll withdraw my residency application.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.834
It was never my aim
to keep you from the children.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.672
And erm, I'll allow you to see them.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.996
It's not ideal for them
to have two homes but erm...

36:51.080 --> 36:54.709
what matters...is that they have
two parents.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.638
We'll share them, 50:50.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.639
If that's what you want.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.069
Right.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.553
Maybe they can stay with me
a couple of nights a week.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.272
And weekends...

37:11.320 --> 37:13.311
..every so often?

37:13.400 --> 37:16.517
You know... My travelling.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.114
And your golf.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.955
Oh, how did we ever let it
come to this, Karen?

37:33.520 --> 37:35.476
God knows.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.590
The last couple of weeks,
I've even started hating you.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.198
We had so much.

37:50.840 --> 37:55.516
Yeah, and we still do, David.
We have three very beautiful children.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.513
Let's try again.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.119
To divorce amicably, I mean.

38:10.560 --> 38:11.913
Well, the er...

38:12.000 --> 38:13.877
the lawyers won't like it very much.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.558
It's our divorce, not theirs.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.955
I wish you'd let me handle that.
I'd have got you a much better deal.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.473
I got the deal I wanted.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.516
It's what you pay me for.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.309
I think I'll walk. Get some air.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.469
Oh, yes, I forgot.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.552
Erm, I'm not going to be able to go away
this weekend.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.596
I'll call you sometime.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.956
I don't know.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.070
Let's look at the research again.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.796
Look, it's er, getting rather late.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.155
Maybe we should send out for some food.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.037
Chinese?

39:13.120 --> 39:14.678
Yeah, or Thai.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.910
Actually... I'm sorry.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.389
You're going to have to
count me out of this.

39:20.480 --> 39:24.473
We can do it again in the morning,
but, er, let's face it,

39:24.560 --> 39:28.030
whatever we decide tonight,
we're only going to undecide tomorrow.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.873
And then again three times
until we come to the conclusion

39:30.960 --> 39:34.714
that this is by far the best ad and we
should have gone with it in the first place.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.153
Doug, I'm really sorry.

39:37.240 --> 39:42.872
I love my job but I also love my family and
I don't see why the two can't be compatible.

39:42.960 --> 39:47.033
Why do we think that unless we're here
till 7:00 it doesn't count?

39:49.280 --> 39:51.953
I realise I'm being completely
out of line, but er...

39:52.040 --> 39:54.838
unless I've talked myself out of a job,

39:54.920 --> 39:58.037
I shall see you all tomorrow.
Shall we say nine o'clock?

40:00.720 --> 40:02.950
Maybe 9:30 would be better.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.956
Thank you, Howard. 9:30.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.270
Right. Night-night.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.433
You know, she's right. This is the one.

40:20.720 --> 40:21.869
Whoo!

40:23.400 --> 40:24.628
What are we celebrating?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.836
What do you think?

40:38.240 --> 40:39.992
Hi.
- Hey.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.679
Where have you been?
- Shopping.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.437
Bought you a little present.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.436
It's got Lady Madonna on it.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.512
Thanks.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.756
I'm sorry.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.996
I do love you, you know.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.230
I know. I know.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.155
Sometimes it's just hard to accept.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.357
You were right, though.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.118
About the visa.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.314
Not that I was after one, but...

41:25.400 --> 41:27.755
it is the reason we married.

41:27.840 --> 41:32.118
I mean... If I hadn't had to leave
the country, then...

41:32.200 --> 41:33.997
we wouldn't have tied the knot.

41:34.080 --> 41:37.436
We'd have stayed as we were,
still going out or...

41:38.480 --> 41:41.472
..maybe we'd have even broken up by now.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.835
But instead we're husband and wife.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.953
What are you trying to say, Jo?

41:55.520 --> 41:57.476
I don't know, Pete.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.516
I don't know.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.629
Hi.
- Hey.

43:11.720 --> 43:14.234
After you.
- No, you first.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.753
No, I'm not in a hurry, really.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.196
OK.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.794
Morning!

43:33.200 --> 43:35.668
Good morning. Sleep well?

43:35.760 --> 43:37.193
No.

43:37.280 --> 43:42.229
It's that Lee. Every time I'm dropping off,
he wake me up.

43:42.320 --> 43:45.073
Yeah, he wake me up too.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.993
Perhaps you could ask him
to keep it down in future.

43:48.080 --> 43:50.116
The noise, I mean.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.079
Want some of this?

43:55.120 --> 43:57.076
Just hold the line, please.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.116
Robyn Duff for you, David.

44:01.600 --> 44:02.794
No.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.148
It is.

44:06.240 --> 44:10.836
No! I mean...I don't want to speak to her.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.388
She rang yesterday as well. Twice.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.199
I'm in a meeting.

44:20.320 --> 44:22.470
Ah. Right.

44:24.560 --> 44:26.630
I'm sorry, he's in a meeting.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.553
Can I take a message...again?

44:34.400 --> 44:38.154
Is three enough today, do you think?
- You need to take Matthew to his minder's.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.470
Well, Rachel, I'm late.
- I'm later.

44:42.040 --> 44:43.996
Oh, come on, then.
- Thank you.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.833
Ooh! I love you two.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.799
I love you too.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.673
Right, I'm off. Bye-bye, love.
- Bye.

44:54.760 --> 44:57.593
Yes, get out, nutter.

45:16.160 --> 45:20.199
For Sale sign! You know, a big wooden board
with ''For Sale'' written on it!

45:20.280 --> 45:23.113
You're an estate agent,
I'm sure you've seen them.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.356
What letter?

45:29.000 --> 45:30.592
What, a letter from your office?

45:33.720 --> 45:36.029
We didn't receive any letter.

45:36.120 --> 45:38.315
I'm telling you again, we didn't receive it!

45:46.840 --> 45:49.308
It must have got lost in the post
or something.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.833
You have to have an appointment!

45:54.920 --> 45:56.672
David, I'm sorry.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.797
That's all right, Sally. This is Robyn Duff.

45:59.880 --> 46:01.677
Oh, he's in a meeting.

46:06.480 --> 46:09.790
When I was 15,
I had a boyfriend called Martin Norris.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.836
We went out for six months.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.512
Well, I thought we did.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.512
But for the last three months,
I never saw him.

46:16.600 --> 46:21.071
He didn't return my calls, he was never in.
I thought he must have gone on holiday.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.390
It turns out he'd dumped me!

46:23.480 --> 46:25.869
He just never mentioned it.

46:25.960 --> 46:27.916
Sound at all familiar?

46:29.000 --> 46:30.877
Well?

46:30.960 --> 46:33.349
Have you nothing to say for yourself?

46:33.440 --> 46:36.159
Me? I don't think it's me
that's got the explaining to do!

46:36.240 --> 46:38.913
Not after your outburst the other day.
- Meaning what?

46:39.000 --> 46:42.072
I specifically asked you not to bring
Karen's alcoholism into play!

46:42.160 --> 46:45.675
Wrong. You said you hoped
it wouldn't come to that. Well, it did.

46:45.760 --> 46:48.911
It was just so underhand!
I didn't seem fair!

46:49.000 --> 46:52.072
Oh, grow up, David! I'm your lawyer!

46:52.160 --> 46:54.310
Fair doesn't come into it.

46:54.400 --> 46:58.154
All I'm concerned with
is protecting your interests.

46:58.240 --> 47:01.550
The way things were going, you'd
have been lucky to see your kids at all!

47:01.640 --> 47:03.835
Then you'd have been bleating
to me about fair!

47:05.920 --> 47:07.876
I was doing my job!

47:09.080 --> 47:11.036
I don't expect gratitude,

47:11.120 --> 47:13.793
but I don't expect to be
treated like this either.

47:15.320 --> 47:17.276
Goodbye, David.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.549
<i>Stand clear, doors closing.</i>

47:39.640 --> 47:41.870
Robyn!

47:48.320 --> 47:50.276
Sorry, this is an emergency.

47:57.800 --> 47:58.835
Robyn!

48:04.880 --> 48:06.393
Robyn!

48:07.520 --> 48:09.476
Robyn!

48:11.000 --> 48:13.116
Robyn!

48:14.520 --> 48:17.034
God, that was further than I thought.
Look, I'm sorry.

48:18.120 --> 48:20.395
Oh, David. Thank you.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.869
This makes everything OK.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.474
Really?
- No, of course not!

48:28.240 --> 48:31.073
Did you honestly think
that getting a cheap bunch of flowers

48:31.160 --> 48:32.991
was going to make the little lady happy?

48:33.080 --> 48:34.752
Actually, I stole them.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.911
Look, I am sorry!

48:38.000 --> 48:39.956
So am I, David.

48:40.040 --> 48:43.476
For ever thinking you were anything more
than just another client.
