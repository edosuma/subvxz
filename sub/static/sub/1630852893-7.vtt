WEBVTT

00:21.479 --> 00:23.732
Hey, Siri, FaceTime Daddy.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.736
<i>Ah! You ruined my drive. What?</i>

00:27.819 --> 00:30.238
Sorry about that.
I just wanted to say happy birthday, Dad.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.741
<i>Hey, hey!</i>
<i>Gary made it on the green in one.</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:34.617
<i>And he's legally blind in his left eye.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.369
<i>Way to go, Gary.</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:38.538
Okay. Uh, did you get my gift?

00:38.621 --> 00:42.250
<i>No, but Sal Jr.</i>
<i>got me this primo golf shirt.</i>

00:42.333 --> 00:44.502
My sister got you a golf shirt?

00:44.586 --> 00:46.046
<i>Yeah. Bless her heart.</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:49.674
<i>She never forgets</i>
<i>her old man's love for Lefty Mickelson.</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:53.178
Yeah, that was actually my idea.
I told her that you like Lefty Mickelson.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.304
That was… I told her that.

00:54.387 --> 00:58.058
<i>Tony, you're boring me. On my birthday.</i>

00:58.141 --> 00:59.350
Okay, sorry about that.

00:59.434 --> 01:03.521
<i>The day your grandmother pushed me out.</i>
<i>With my head this big then!</i>

01:03.605 --> 01:04.481
Sorry about that, Pop.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.357
-I just want to say that I love y--

01:10.070 --> 01:12.030
Your sister sounds great.

01:12.113 --> 01:16.576
And my dad doesn't love me either.
Another thing you and I have in common.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.536
Is my tie okay?

01:18.620 --> 01:19.788
-Yeah, it's good.
-Am I good?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.289
-All good. Ready to go.
-All right.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.708
<i>Oh, Naird.</i>
<i>I was actually gonna call you later.</i>

01:23.792 --> 01:26.044
-Oh, well, great minds.
<i>-What do you want, Naird?</i>

01:26.127 --> 01:29.297
Well, sir, four months ago,
the men and women of Space Force

01:29.380 --> 01:32.008
had their pay frozen
due to budgetary cuts.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.843
<i>Don't ask for a raise.</i>

01:33.927 --> 01:35.178
<i>Man, Naird.</i>

01:35.720 --> 01:38.139
<i>You got some big balls on you, don't you?</i>

01:38.223 --> 01:39.140
Hear me out, sir.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.976
I think that even a small increase
would go a long way

01:42.060 --> 01:44.145
to keep this very desirable team

01:44.229 --> 01:46.648
from going off
and pursuing other job opportunities.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.192
<i>Well, as you noted,</i>
<i>it has been four months,</i>

01:49.275 --> 01:52.237
<i>so feel free to bring it up</i>
<i>with the full Armed Services Committee</i>

01:52.320 --> 01:53.863
<i>when we talk with you later today.</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:56.032
<i>We got a lot to talk about.</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:59.911
That's today? We, uh…
Is there anything that I should be, um--

02:00.495 --> 02:02.455
All right, he's gone.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.333
-How does he know the size of your testes?

02:05.416 --> 02:07.043
How do <i>you</i> knowthe size of my testes?

02:07.127 --> 02:10.171
Oh, well, just as a one-baller,
that subject matter holds my interest.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.881
-That's all.
-Fair enough.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.676
Genesis 35X-20.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.345
Feed's incoming, online.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.888
Good. Next.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.766
Uh, Rush 2112.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.560
"Genesis," "Rush."

02:24.602 --> 02:27.772
Are all your satellites
just named after '70s rock bands?

02:27.856 --> 02:29.732
I never made that connection.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.234
Me neither.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.154
Yeah. Huh!

02:36.990 --> 02:38.491
Are you okay, Dr. Chan?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.034
Me?

02:40.577 --> 02:41.411
Yeah.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.830
Did you get a call from SpaceX?

02:44.581 --> 02:45.582
SpaceX?

02:46.207 --> 02:47.083
No.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.626
So they called you?

02:49.794 --> 02:51.045
I just said no.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.797
Yeah, but I can see you're lying.

02:54.465 --> 02:55.383
How?

02:55.466 --> 02:59.262
Because you haven't blinked or breathed
since I said "SpaceX."

03:01.097 --> 03:03.933
Yeah, they called,
and they offered me a job.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.810
I'm really sorry, Dr. Mallory.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.187
Don't be sorry. Take it.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.148
It's five times the pay
and half the bureaucratic bullshit.

03:10.231 --> 03:13.693
But we're, like, a team.
You're Jordan and I'm Pippen, right?

03:13.776 --> 03:15.612
Remember, Pippen had his best season

03:15.695 --> 03:18.198
when Jordan went
out of the league for a year.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.409
Dr. Chan, you have to go out there
and make your own legacy.

03:21.492 --> 03:22.702
Uh, Dr. Mallory?

03:22.785 --> 03:27.874
On satellite Blue Oyster Cult 181-X,
camera's not responding, nor its booster.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.793
Dr. Chan, run a diagnostic on that.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.380
Meet me in General Naird's office
and bring aspirin.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.007
Fucking SpaceX.

03:36.090 --> 03:39.302
Go fuck yourselves with a Tesla charger,

03:39.385 --> 03:41.262
you useless twats.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.681
I hope your car
drives itself off a bridge,

03:43.765 --> 03:48.394
and you get electrocuted,
you bitch boring punks.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.156
-Hey, bug.
-Hey.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.282
Uh…

04:01.991 --> 04:05.912
I hope you're not doing
that online stock trade gambling crap.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.539
No, you told me not to, remember?

04:08.623 --> 04:10.625
Well, good. Good, good, good.

04:10.708 --> 04:14.295
'Cause you know what, hon?
Being lucky is not an accomplishment.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.172
I want you to have life experiences

04:16.256 --> 04:19.175
that you look back on with pride
and say, "I did that."

04:19.259 --> 04:22.845
Yes. Actually, that's why
I think I should go to Portugal.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.430
Dr. Mallory loved it there.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.101
This is gonna sound a little xenophobic,
but Portugal…

04:28.685 --> 04:29.727
is awful.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.063
Rotten, rotten place.

04:32.146 --> 04:36.401
Uh, okay, let me remind you that you said
it was okay for me to take a gap year.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.237
Remember? You said you were
"cool" with me traveling?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.238
Yes, it's fine.

04:40.321 --> 04:43.658
I'm just saying that
there are excellent hiking trails

04:43.741 --> 04:45.326
-twenty miles from this base.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.619
How is that abroad?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.580
Oh, Captain Ali. Settle this argument.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.958
Portugal, yea or nay? I say it sucks.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.209
What? Um…

04:54.043 --> 04:55.878
No.<i> Eu amo Portugal.</i>

04:55.962 --> 04:58.756
I mean, Lisboa is one of the great cities
of the world. Are you going?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.217
No one here is Portuguese.
Who you trying to impress?

05:01.301 --> 05:04.095
Yeah. Um, sir, I need to speak with you.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.266
Oh no, please! Oh God! Oh!

05:08.891 --> 05:13.021
Oh my God! The sprinklers just went off!
I didn't do it!

05:13.604 --> 05:17.942
Oh! This is exactly why
you save take-out napkins. Oh my--

05:18.026 --> 05:20.028
Brad, just get a bucket and a mop.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.280
Yeah. All right. Okay. Good idea.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.491
Best evidence thus far
for the existence of God.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.953
The vending machines disgorging free M&Ms.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.622
-Ooh. Sweet. Thanks for the tip.
-Peanut.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.791
What the hell is going on?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.626
No, no, no, I told you I was getting Dad

05:35.710 --> 05:37.920
a Lefty Mickelson golf shirt
for his birthday.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.964
You straight-up stole my idea.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.383
<i> Oh, wow.</i>
<i>That's a serious accusation, Tony.</i>

05:42.467 --> 05:45.887
<i>And as an attorney,</i>
<i>I warn you it's potentially actionable.</i>

05:45.970 --> 05:48.598
I'm sorry.
You would sue family over a shirt?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.975
<i>Fuck around and find out. </i><i>Bye!</i>

05:51.059 --> 05:52.685
<i>I'll be at Disney World with Daddy.</i>

05:52.769 --> 05:55.229
What? I'm the one
that always wanted to go to Disney World.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.648
I want to do Great Thunder Mountain
and he wouldn't take me.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.317
<i>-I know that. Bye.</i>

06:01.402 --> 06:02.945
What? What is that?

06:03.029 --> 06:06.157
Do you see that? I was passing by,
and I was like, "What is this?"

06:06.240 --> 06:09.786
So I picked it up, and it's weed.
Someone has been smoking weed down here.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.496
-Oh, wasn't me.
-Huh.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.956
Hey, I… I kinda heard
some of your phone call.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.249
Was it about your dad?

06:15.333 --> 06:17.710
No, Brad, it's not about my dad.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.920
Oh, okay.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.631
Yes, okay, yeah. It was… It was…
It was about my dad. Yeah.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.884
Look, families
are very complicated, all right?

06:24.967 --> 06:28.012
I worked really hard to become
a one-star general to impress my dad,

06:28.096 --> 06:30.723
only to find out
he wanted me to become a travel agent.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.308
A travel agent.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.935
Yeah, but I couldn't cut it.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.730
Give me a hit of that jive parsley.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.565
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.443
-Hit me!
-Small. Small.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.322
Oh!

06:47.782 --> 06:48.950
There it is.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.620
You know, the only thing that
impresses my dad is when I make money.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.415
He doesn't care about
anything else happening in my life.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.502
Don't tell General Naird,
but I actually, uh,

06:59.585 --> 07:00.962
I got a job offer.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.214
To run socials
for Addison Rae's new makeup line.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.466
Sweet.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.554
First, a satellite acting out,
now a sprinkler. Coincidence?

07:09.637 --> 07:10.471
Which satellite?

07:10.555 --> 07:13.933
Blue Oyster Cult, 181-X, sir.
The thruster's just firing randomly.

07:14.016 --> 07:14.851
Where is it?

07:14.934 --> 07:19.021
It was above 46 degrees north latitude
and 37 degrees east longitude.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.773
Over the Sea of Azov.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.608
Yeah. Wow. Uh, was that a guess?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.485
Yes, I got this far by guessing.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.820
Hold on. That's over Russia.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.281
We gotta fix this thing
before it falls on something Russian.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.366
Dr. Chan, go down to the main server room,

07:30.450 --> 07:33.661
see if you can patch in directly
to the satellite from there.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.372
Captain, reach out to the NSA,
see if everything's quiet on their end.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.290
Yes, sir.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.583
This can't happen. Not today.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.669
Jesus. That's why
it's a four-month review.

07:44.922 --> 07:45.798
Hey.

07:46.632 --> 07:47.467
Hey.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.052
I can wait for the next one.
You can go ahead.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.014
No, I'm sure we can share
a short elevator ride together.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.348
Cool.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.229
Hey, actually, uh,
I've been meaning to talk to you. Um…

08:00.313 --> 08:02.356
I didn't want you to, like,
hear it around.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.652
Yeah, I think I'm gonna be
moving on from Space Force.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.488
I just think it's time to make a change.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.780
Really?

08:09.864 --> 08:12.116
Yeah, I was just about
to tell the general.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.785
Yeah, I might do something cool,
like real estate

08:14.869 --> 08:17.914
or go back to Hawaii,
fly helicopter tours.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.292
Wow. That… That sounds very nice.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.754
You know, I'm actually
thinking about leaving too.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.464
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.174
SpaceX sent me an offer.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.592
Oh my God. Congrats.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.843
It's a great offer.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.222
Hey, you're not leaving,
like, because of me, right?

08:34.305 --> 08:35.723
What? No.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.059
And you're not leaving
because of me, right?

08:38.142 --> 08:39.018
Nope.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.520
-Good.
-Yep.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.606
Nobody's leaving because of anybody.

08:59.247 --> 09:02.375
Mark, isn't this a lot of coincidence?

09:02.458 --> 09:04.877
Do you think the Russians
actually hacked that satellite?

09:04.961 --> 09:06.796
I think they may have hacked…

09:07.880 --> 09:08.839
…a lot…

09:10.591 --> 09:12.927
…more than a satellite.

09:13.010 --> 09:16.013
God, the stupid Wi-Fi is down.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.016
-Yeah, there we go. I got it.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Straight. Straight!

09:19.100 --> 09:20.643
You don't… You're lift--

09:21.894 --> 09:23.020
I didn't do it.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.731
Whoa. What the fuck?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.858
Shit. I think
we might be, uh, stuck.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.443
-Oh fuck.
-No bars.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.486
What?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.029
-Fuck.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.575
Okay, but… Okay, but there has to be,
like, a way… a way out of here.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.702
It's called waiting for the power
to come back on,

09:37.785 --> 09:39.161
and then the door will just open.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.371
No, no, no, no, no!

09:40.454 --> 09:42.748
-Are you okay?
-No! No, we're fucking stuck in here!

09:42.832 --> 09:43.666
-It's fine.
-Help!

09:43.749 --> 09:45.042
-Whoa, whoa, let's just--
-Help!

09:45.126 --> 09:46.627
Hold on. Don't break the elevator.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.754
-Can somebody hear me?
-Just chill. Just chill.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.340
It's gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay. All right?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.675
-Help!
-Oh!

09:52.758 --> 09:54.510
We're fucking trapped in here! Help!

09:54.594 --> 09:56.596
-Help! Angela's losing her shit!
-Help!

09:56.679 --> 09:58.389
-Help us!
-Help!

09:58.472 --> 10:00.641
-Watch your step, bug.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.730
Hey, what is going on?

10:09.984 --> 10:13.279
We're not exactly sure what happened.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.074
We think there was a power surge,

10:17.950 --> 10:19.076
and after that,

10:19.994 --> 10:21.954
everything just went haywire.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.059
Let's go.
Away from the computers.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.394
What's the damage, Xyler?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.146
They've locked us out of our systems

10:47.229 --> 10:50.107
and they're pushing Blue Oyster Cult
out of orbit over Russian airspace.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.025
Why?

10:51.108 --> 10:54.445
To crash the satellite and embarrass us
in the eyes of the world.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.529
Because they can.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.531
And make Space Force a laughingstock.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.533
I guess we're not getting our raises now,
are we?

10:59.617 --> 11:01.869
We have to get back online,
fire the thrusters.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.955
Now how late is too late
for Blue Oyster Cult?

11:05.039 --> 11:06.957
-An hour?
-An hour. All right.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.127
-So we are locked out of our computers.
-Yep.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.963
People with the keys
are somewhere in Russia.

11:13.047 --> 11:16.676
Can't communicate. And they can
hear us through our computers?

11:16.759 --> 11:18.552
-Seems so.
-Wait a second.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.806
We could use that to our advantage.
We could manipulate that.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.016
They don't know that we know what we know,

11:24.100 --> 11:26.769
but we know that they don't know
we know what we know.

11:26.852 --> 11:27.687
Right, Brad?

11:27.770 --> 11:28.813
No.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.566
We lie. We make them think
that we are weaker than we are.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.610
-I love this. I love this.
-Smoke and mirrors.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.781
What do you do when a Russian bear's
batting you around? You play…

11:38.864 --> 11:40.700
-Chess?
-…dead, right?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.993
Oh, yeah, right.
I always play dead when I play chess.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.912
-You got it now?
-No.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.707
We exaggerate the impact of their hack.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.918
At a certain point, they're not even
gonna want to play the game anymore.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.545
-Brilliant.
-You still don't understand.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.964
-No.
-It's like we're putting on a little play.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.800
What do you know about theater?
Because I think you can use guidance.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.345
I was in a Nativity play once.
I was the Virgin Mary.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.724
It was an all-boys academy.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.142
Oh, I'll be General Naird.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.185
No, I'll be General Naird. You're Brad.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.645
Oh, that's not much of a part.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.148
But who's to blame for that, Brad?

12:12.231 --> 12:14.650
God, it's so hot, right?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.445
I just feel like it's like…
I'm, like, burning up in here right now.

12:17.528 --> 12:21.323
Angela, I think you're having
a panic attack, but it's okay.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.493
You just need to breathe.
Everything's okay.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.371
-Take off your pants.
-What?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.416
And, like, your shirt.
All of it. Here. Let's try this.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.542
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Come here.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.420
Okay, okay, okay, I can't believe
I'm saying this right now,

12:34.503 --> 12:36.630
but having sex is not gonna help.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.466
I mean, let's find out, right?

12:38.549 --> 12:40.843
-No. No. No. No.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.221
I just… I can't be trapped again.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.392
Angela, you're not
on the moon anymore. Okay?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.895
-You're safe. Right here on Earth.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.938
There's plenty of air here.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.857
-Well, I think.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.443
Okay, sorry. Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that last part.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.653
There's plenty of air. Everything is okay.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.613
Just focus.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.198
Focus on your breathing

13:02.281 --> 13:05.451
and concentrate on an object
in front of you.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.453
Look at my glasses. Look right here.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.079
Glasses.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.999
Yeah, concentrate on my glasses
and just breathe.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.417
-Glasses.
-Yep.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.668
Glasses…

13:16.921 --> 13:18.422
Good. Good. Good.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.966
Um, why do you
wear your glasses during sex?

13:21.050 --> 13:24.011
I've… I've just been
wanting to ask you that.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.598
I guess I… I never had a chance
to take 'em off.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.308
Always just happened so fast.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.101
And…

13:32.311 --> 13:35.773
also, I just, uh, want to see your face.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.568
You need glasses when we're that close?
Your eyes must be terrible.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.947
Oh, yeah, they're so bad.
They're basically ornamental.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.658
Yeah.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.369
Doing great.

13:48.994 --> 13:53.415
"General Naird, who do you think
is behind this dastardly hack?"

13:53.499 --> 13:57.002
"Well, as a four-star general, I smell
the hands of the Chinese behind this."

13:57.086 --> 13:59.046
"That country is growing in power."

13:59.129 --> 14:00.339
"If I lived next door,

14:00.422 --> 14:03.759
I would make common cause
with old allies from across the seas."

14:03.843 --> 14:04.677
What does that mean?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.011
-I wouldn't talk like that.
-Shh.

14:06.095 --> 14:10.099
"If only the Chinese knew
what was really on that satellite."

14:10.182 --> 14:12.643
"Oh, I've said too much."

14:12.726 --> 14:13.811
"What is it, sir?"

14:13.894 --> 14:17.064
"It's classified, Ms. Havistock,
my loyal secretary."

14:17.147 --> 14:19.358
"But that satellite is experimental."

14:19.441 --> 14:21.151
"Powered by a thousand pounds

14:21.235 --> 14:26.490
of the deadliest radioactive poison
in the world, plutonium-243."

14:26.574 --> 14:28.492
"To put a finer point on all of this,

14:28.576 --> 14:31.287
here comes the world's
biggest expert in plutonium,

14:31.370 --> 14:33.497
Professor Montgomery Q. Tanner."

14:40.045 --> 14:45.718
Who is arriving on horseback
because he is a colorful eccentric.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.556
"Uh, howdy! Here I come."

14:50.639 --> 14:52.266
"I'm dismounting now."

14:52.349 --> 14:53.684
Are you the professor?

14:53.767 --> 14:56.562
I thought you froze. You know what?
You could be the janitor.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.731
"Professor,
tell us some good news."

14:58.814 --> 15:01.525
"I am a professor,
and I do not have good news."

15:01.609 --> 15:03.152
"If that satellite crashes,

15:03.235 --> 15:06.196
it will kill millions
all over our beloved Russia."

15:06.280 --> 15:08.532
-"What?"
-"Oh. This is horrifying."

15:08.616 --> 15:09.617
"Sorry to break ship."

15:09.700 --> 15:11.702
-"We are in danger."
-"Tough titties, baby."

15:11.785 --> 15:13.203
"We are all in serious danger."

15:13.287 --> 15:19.001
"Something bad is going to happen
unless we get control of our computers."

15:19.585 --> 15:20.544
Ow.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.380
-No? Too much?
-No, keep going.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.966
This is what my mom did for me
when I was, like, sick.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.260
-Supposed to be a pressure point.
-Mmm.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.262
-Yeah. Hmm.
-That feels good.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.099
You know, I made that, uh,
TikTok feta pasta.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.142
Hmm?

15:35.225 --> 15:38.437
Yeah. I don't… I don't get it.
What did you like about it?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.606
I don't know. I didn't… I didn't eat it.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.150
I wanted you to make it first
to see if it was bad.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.277
-You wanted me to be a guinea pig?
-Yeah.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.321
We could have just eaten it together.

15:47.404 --> 15:51.283
I had that every night for a week,
and it was disgusting.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.451
Yeah. Sorry about that.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.329
I probably should've, uh…
I could've helped you out with that one.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.665
Yeah. You don't have to apologize.

15:57.748 --> 16:01.710
I, uh, you know…
I kind of did a lot of things wrong.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.672
I mean, we… we both did,
I think.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.131
Yeah. But, I mean…

16:07.925 --> 16:09.176
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.347
I sort of feel like
everything got really nuts,

16:13.430 --> 16:16.475
and I kinda wish we could just
wipe the slate clean, you know,

16:16.558 --> 16:18.644
and go back and…

16:23.899 --> 16:26.819
"Professor, isn't there anything we can do

16:26.902 --> 16:29.905
to stop that giant orbiting dirty bomb

16:29.989 --> 16:32.282
from crashing
and killing hundreds of millions?"

16:32.366 --> 16:34.910
"No, there is nothing we can do."

16:34.994 --> 16:40.207
"My scientific opinion as a professor
and an eccentric is that all is lost."

16:40.290 --> 16:42.418
"Professor, I don't understand."

16:42.501 --> 16:45.754
"I'm only a simple marinating--
maintenance man,

16:45.838 --> 16:49.717
but why can't we use our computers

16:49.800 --> 16:52.428
to fix this situation?"

16:52.511 --> 16:56.432
"Nobody wants millions of people to die."

16:56.515 --> 16:58.267
"You stupid janitor!"

16:58.350 --> 17:01.562
"We can't use our computers
because the Chinese--"

17:02.771 --> 17:03.897
Sir!

17:03.981 --> 17:06.275
We are no longer locked out!

17:07.359 --> 17:09.570
Oh.

17:09.653 --> 17:14.825
Now we need to input new telemetry
to get that KH-11 back in orbit, stat.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.493
-Yes, sir.
-Uh…

17:16.577 --> 17:18.370
-Oh!

17:18.454 --> 17:21.040
But I have a confession to make.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.751
I've been going to night school,

17:23.834 --> 17:26.462
and I have obtained three PhDs.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.674
Good. You can tell me about that later,
Janitor Fred.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.593
General, we're back in contact
with the satellite.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.763
Good. Fire up the thrusters
and switch to the onboard camera.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.141
Sorry, we were, uh,
trapped in an elevator.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.434
Yep.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.019
Are you wearing lipstick?

17:42.603 --> 17:45.147
What? No. Xyler, get out of my chair, man.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.983
I just rebooted the remote navigation.
You're welcome.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.944
Dr. Chan, recalculate
the new thruster data

17:51.028 --> 17:53.697
and relay it to Blue Oyster Cult
immediately. Instanter.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.866
-Okay, Roger that, Dr…

17:55.949 --> 17:58.577
Fuck!

17:58.660 --> 18:00.037
-What's wrong?
-Seriously?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.830
You're auto-updating now?

18:01.914 --> 18:04.833
I won't be able to calculate
the right data for the satellite for…

18:04.917 --> 18:06.251
49 minutes.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.461
How long till impact?

18:07.544 --> 18:09.171
Eleven minutes and 44 seconds.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.839
Fuck Microsoft!

18:10.923 --> 18:11.799
Okay.

18:11.882 --> 18:12.841
Fuck!

18:12.925 --> 18:14.426
All right. Um…

18:15.260 --> 18:17.638
Adrian, please tell me we have a plan B.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.140
There we go. Good. Good. Old school.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.893
-I like it.
-Eleven minutes and seven seconds.

18:22.976 --> 18:26.271
Okay. I know. We can see the timer
on the screen. We can all see it.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.606
What… What is going on?

18:27.689 --> 18:29.274
Listen, everyone.

18:29.358 --> 18:34.404
Dr. Mallory is in the process
of doing these calculations by hand.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.907
So this whole thing
may come down to the wire.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.826
-Done.
-Oh. Good. He got it. Great.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.452
Xyler, put these in.

18:41.036 --> 18:41.912
Thank God.

18:42.496 --> 18:46.375
No, not just yet. So, Chan,
why is the satellite not responding?

18:46.458 --> 18:48.377
The autopilot has a rebooting of its own.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.129
Okay. You're gonna have to fly it by hand.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.046
What?

18:51.130 --> 18:55.467
The W-A-S-D keys,
they control the pitch and the yaw. Go.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.718
Okay. Okay.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.722
You can do this, Chan.
I believe in you, Chan.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.182
-Fuck.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.309
-<i>Low orbit.</i>
-The orbit's still decaying.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.770
-I don't know. This is not <i>Fortnite.</i>
I got it. Okay.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.939
-<i>Low orbit.</i>

19:09.022 --> 19:10.983
<i>-Low orbit.</i>

19:11.066 --> 19:13.527
<i>-Low orbit.</i>

19:13.610 --> 19:15.779
<i>-Low orbit.</i>

19:15.863 --> 19:17.906
<i>-Low orbit.</i>

19:17.990 --> 19:20.659
<i>-Low orbit.</i>

19:20.742 --> 19:22.911
<i>-Low orbit.</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:23.954
<i>Low or--</i>

19:24.037 --> 19:25.539
Ah. We got it. Bird's back in the sky.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.708
-Hey!

19:28.667 --> 19:32.588
Blue Oyster Cult
need no longer fear the reaper!

19:32.671 --> 19:35.174
Captain Ali for the win!

19:35.257 --> 19:38.260
Also, let's not forget Mallory
with all that weird math shit!

19:38.343 --> 19:40.179
-No. Know what? We're all winners.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.973
I love this team! This is the best team!

19:44.099 --> 19:47.102
As long as we stick together,
we can do anything.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.189
Yeah. Um, sir, actually,
can I talk to you for a minute?

19:50.272 --> 19:52.441
Uh, General, it's 3:50. Sec Def at 4:00.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.026
Oh! Yeah. That's right.

19:54.109 --> 19:57.154
Um, come by my office later.
I have a very important meeting right now.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.405
-Wish me luck!
-Good luck.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.990
-Good luck, sir.
-Good luck.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.373
Dr. Mallory, that ruler thing was so cool.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.542
Slide rule. Got us to the moon.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.170
You see, I still have
so much to learn from you.

20:13.253 --> 20:17.007
SpaceX, they can go find themselves
another handsome scientist, you know?

20:17.633 --> 20:18.967
I'm gonna stay.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.928
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.975
-Yeah.
-That was impressive, for sure.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.145
Maybe there's another reason?

20:32.314 --> 20:33.315
Well…

20:37.694 --> 20:40.030
Tony. Psst! Tony.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.616
Please don't tell anyone
that I smoked jive parsley.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.785
I definitely won't
be using those words, Brad.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.539
-You want me to get you more, don't you?
-No.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.751
Before you leave.

20:52.834 --> 20:53.669
You got it.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.379
Is the General free?

20:55.879 --> 20:56.964
There's a line.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.972
<i> I didn't wanna do it,</i>
<i>but I had to.</i>

21:05.055 --> 21:09.101
<i>I fought it as hard as I could,</i>
<i>but ultimately I was overridden.</i>

21:09.184 --> 21:10.894
<i>So, congratulations.</i>

21:10.978 --> 21:13.730
Well, thank you, sir.
It feels good to get a win.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.943
And I'm sure the team is going to
appreciate the raises and the new mission.

21:18.026 --> 21:22.406
But, right now, I have
a whole waiting room full of people

21:22.489 --> 21:24.408
who I would like to give the good news.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.744
<i>Well, it's good news to you.</i>
<i>To me, it's just news.</i>

21:27.828 --> 21:28.996
<i>And I lost a bet.</i>

21:31.164 --> 21:33.625
-Sir.
-Tony, guess what?

21:34.376 --> 21:35.669
We got the raises.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.880
-We got the raises?
-We did.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.843
-All of us?
-What did you wanna talk to me about?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.646
Sir, I need to speak to you.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.108
Captain, I have been meaning
to give this to you.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.695
-Please open and read at your discretion.
-Okay.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.947
So, what can I do for you?

22:04.031 --> 22:05.866
I'm leaving Space Force.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.536
Okay.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.164
Yeah, so, ever since, um, the moon,

22:12.247 --> 22:14.041
I've just… I've been…

22:14.124 --> 22:16.668
Um, I just think it's time for me
to make a career change.

22:16.752 --> 22:17.753
Oh.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.422
I see.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.968
Yeah, so I am going to leave
and move to Hawaii.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.847
Oh, Hawaii.
That's very nice. Very beautiful.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.892
Yeah, it… Um, yes.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.103
You know, I'm not coming back.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.856
Oh, no, no. Yeah. No, I understand.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.066
Okay.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.779
I'm sorry.
I just kind of thought you would be, like,

22:43.862 --> 22:45.864
trying to convince me to stay.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.658
You know, tell me I did a good job.

22:49.534 --> 22:53.205
You know, I saved that satellite,
or I brought the astronauts home.

22:53.914 --> 22:57.417
Tell me I conducted myself
with dignity and professionalism.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.295
Tell me I'm not
the type of person who quits.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.838
Isn't that what you always say?

23:03.340 --> 23:05.592
If I said any of those things,

23:06.301 --> 23:07.803
would it change your mind?

23:09.554 --> 23:10.389
No.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.016
Then I respect your decision.

23:15.060 --> 23:15.936
All right.

23:16.019 --> 23:20.357
Um, then you will have my letter
of resignation by the end of the day.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.650
Very well.

23:23.944 --> 23:24.861
Well,

23:26.071 --> 23:26.905
goodbye.

23:26.988 --> 23:27.864
Good luck.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.748
You did a very good job.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.130
<i> Dear Captain Ali,</i>

23:43.213 --> 23:47.592
<i>in recognition of your leadership</i>
<i>and exemplary dedication to service,</i>

23:47.676 --> 23:50.595
<i>you have been promoted</i>
<i>to the rank of Major.</i>

23:50.679 --> 23:53.640
<i>Congratulations and continued success.</i>

23:53.723 --> 23:55.308
<i>General Mark R. Naird.</i>

24:02.232 --> 24:06.403
I was worried, but it looks like
the whole team's gonna stick together.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.365
Except for Captain Ali, maybe. And you.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.951
I'm definitely taking a gap year.

24:13.034 --> 24:17.038
Yeah, I know. I know, honey.
You gotta spread your wings. I get it.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.666
I'm not going to Portugal though.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.209
Huh?

24:21.293 --> 24:23.253
I'm going to work in forestry.

24:24.087 --> 24:24.921
Oh.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.506
Wow. Okay.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.884
Don't tell me. Rainforest?

24:29.468 --> 24:32.179
Listen, if you're gonna head
to someplace like the Amazon,

24:32.262 --> 24:35.056
they have all kinds of diseases.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.975
So you're gonna need to get shots.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.937
Uh… I don't know
if there's many diseases in Colorado.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.689
Colorado?

24:42.772 --> 24:45.275
That's where the US Forestry Service is.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.527
I thought you hated Colorado.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.323
It's not my favorite place
in the world, but…

24:52.616 --> 24:54.493
you're here, so.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.256
Oh my God.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.758
Oh…

25:09.841 --> 25:12.093
-You are such a softy.
-No.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.099
Captain Ali.

25:19.434 --> 25:22.312
I haven't received
your letter of resignation.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.774
Actually, it's Major Ali now, sir.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.073
-Morning, everyone.
-Morning.

25:33.156 --> 25:36.034
Well, it seems that we

25:36.117 --> 25:38.537
have made some friends in Washington,

25:38.620 --> 25:40.872
and they've decided
to give us a little present.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.082
A new mission.

25:42.165 --> 25:46.086
We are now part of
the American Strategic Defense Plan.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.504
Oh, sir. Is that the, um--

25:47.587 --> 25:51.132
Yes! That is the Hawaii telescope,

25:51.216 --> 25:54.427
and we now have sole access.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.179
NASA, not so much.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.347
Screw NASA.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.184
-Sorry, sir.
-I will allow it this once.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.852
What are we looking at right now, sir?

26:02.936 --> 26:04.688
-What are we looking at?
-Yeah. What is that?

26:04.771 --> 26:08.858
Uh… That appears to be
a slight smudge on the lens?

26:08.942 --> 26:10.026
Um…

26:10.110 --> 26:12.696
No, I think that might be an asteroid.

26:12.779 --> 26:13.738
Sorry?

26:15.031 --> 26:17.617
A really big fucking asteroid.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.495
And it's getting bigger.
