WEBVTT

00:00.445 --> 00:02.865
My name is Marty Kaan,
and I'm a management consultant.

00:02.899 --> 00:05.553
You're the mad genius
we're paying all this money for?

00:05.587 --> 00:08.148
Every week my team and I go
somewhere and talk people

00:08.183 --> 00:10.192
into thinking
they really, really need us.

00:10.226 --> 00:12.156
Are we billing
Metrocap for this?

00:12.190 --> 00:13.191
Duh.

00:14.726 --> 00:16.590
- Hey, dad?
- Shit. Hey!

00:16.625 --> 00:17.992
What's mom doing here?

00:18.026 --> 00:19.692
You just him flounce around
like it's a done deal.

00:19.726 --> 00:21.592
"Well, our son
is a tranny for life."

00:21.627 --> 00:23.662
Still don't know
exactly what it is we do?

00:23.696 --> 00:25.098
Time's up.

00:25.132 --> 00:26.766
Got to run.
Call me.

00:33.014 --> 00:35.184
Closing...

00:35.304 --> 00:39.256
Closing is the thing I do
that sets me apart from you.

00:40.364 --> 00:42.124
It's what makes me bulletproof.

00:42.726 --> 00:44.147
I can close anybody.

00:44.894 --> 00:48.529
I take my numbers,
my models, my Powerpoint,

00:48.564 --> 00:50.990
and I tickle
your taint just so.

00:51.026 --> 00:52.293
And you know what?

00:52.327 --> 00:56.196
You open like a goddamn
lotus flower, and I'm in.

00:56.386 --> 00:59.054
You hardly even feel it.
Am I right?

00:59.339 --> 01:02.030
I mean, can you see the vista
or can't you, Dick?

01:02.805 --> 01:06.609
- Yeah, actually,
I-I don't know.

01:06.846 --> 01:10.184
Because if... if you can't see
that Galweather can lift you up

01:10.218 --> 01:12.988
from your lowly
minus-20 N. P.S...

01:13.022 --> 01:17.084
Dick, if you don't see that
with absolute fucking clarity,

01:17.179 --> 01:18.980
then your job is shit.

01:19.054 --> 01:21.256
Your life is shit.

01:21.408 --> 01:23.109
Your company will fail.

01:23.158 --> 01:25.201
Your wife, Dick...
she will leave you,

01:25.236 --> 01:27.337
and you will lose everything.

01:27.372 --> 01:28.772
Jesus, Marty.

01:28.807 --> 01:31.842
If you look at it
like an investment, okay,

01:31.877 --> 01:35.846
the return on your dollar
is literally obscene.

01:35.881 --> 01:38.475
You have to be willing
to violate...

01:39.117 --> 01:41.117
violate personal space,

01:41.152 --> 01:43.119
violate manners,
violate the law,

01:43.153 --> 01:47.523
hell, violate every molecule
so all that's left is the "yes."

01:47.557 --> 01:50.359
If we make this deal,
if we actually come aboard,

01:50.394 --> 01:52.595
do you realize
what you'll be getting?

01:52.629 --> 01:55.097
You're getting hope.
You're getting support.

01:55.131 --> 01:57.666
Credibility, right?
Salvation.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.068
Jesus Christ, Dick, you're
getting your company back.

02:00.102 --> 02:02.637
Do you want these things
for pennies on the dollar?

02:02.671 --> 02:04.440
Can we make
this deal right now?

02:04.474 --> 02:06.875
Dick, at the end of two years,
your company

02:06.910 --> 02:09.645
will be as shiny and pink

02:09.680 --> 02:11.584
as the gums of a newborn...

02:12.139 --> 02:16.272
reborn, profitable, stable.

02:17.022 --> 02:19.256
You say yes,
and it's all yours, Dick.

02:20.071 --> 02:21.475
Say yes.

02:23.362 --> 02:24.803
- Yes.
- Yes.

02:27.067 --> 02:28.233
Yes.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.233
Yes.

02:37.379 --> 02:39.748
- Okay, just fucking finish.
- No.

02:39.774 --> 02:41.009
Okay, okay.
You know what?

02:41.028 --> 02:42.095
Time's up.
We're done.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.387
Get off.
You want me to stop,

02:43.414 --> 02:46.417
say the safe word.
Stop. How about that?

02:46.467 --> 02:47.901
- Say the fucking safe word.
- I don't know what the fucking

02:47.943 --> 02:49.243
stupid goddamn safe word is.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.770
The fucking safe word
is "Amsterdam."

02:50.812 --> 02:52.380
You made the goddamn word up.
I didn't...

02:52.391 --> 02:54.093
why would I fucking
make "Amsterdam" up?

02:54.104 --> 02:55.471
Fuck you.

02:55.701 --> 02:59.236
Those...Aren't...
The...Words.

02:59.250 --> 03:02.722
You want to play?

03:02.742 --> 03:05.477
- Yes!
- Come on.

03:05.488 --> 03:07.622
Yeah.
Fucking love it.

03:07.634 --> 03:09.001
Fucking love it.
You love this?

03:09.020 --> 03:11.154
Get the fuck off me!

03:11.306 --> 03:12.967
Yeah, oh, what's
the fucking safe word now?

03:13.258 --> 03:15.726
You fucking tell me.

03:17.424 --> 03:18.925
My...

03:18.958 --> 03:21.046
Fucking...God!
Shit!

03:21.102 --> 03:22.302
Amsterdam!

03:26.099 --> 03:28.634
So you on the beach?

03:28.669 --> 03:30.569
"On the beach."
That's consultant

03:30.604 --> 03:32.471
for "between engagements."

03:32.505 --> 03:33.839
You don't want to stay
on the beach for too long,

03:33.873 --> 03:36.875
or else you become
a "new alum"... recently fired.

03:36.910 --> 03:40.312
No, I'm not on the beach.

03:40.346 --> 03:43.715
- No?
- No, I am developing clients.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.351
I actually have
an engagement starting

03:45.385 --> 03:47.019
in the morning.
Yeah.

03:47.054 --> 03:48.721
And it's huge.

03:48.755 --> 03:49.990
Great.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:58.900 --> 04:00.334
You just had sex.
What? How can you tell?

04:00.369 --> 04:01.903
- Let me see that dick.
- Get the fuck away.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.705
You definitely just had sex.

04:03.739 --> 04:05.173
I just had a client lunch,

04:05.207 --> 04:07.642
closed a $4 million piece
of business... you're welcome.

04:07.676 --> 04:09.910
Okay, well, unless the client
was your penis,

04:09.945 --> 04:11.379
I'm gonna challenge that.

04:11.413 --> 04:12.547
Yeah, you're right.
No, he does.

04:12.581 --> 04:14.420
He smells like pussy.
Excuse me.

04:17.319 --> 04:18.886
Okay, if you weren't
fucking a client,

04:18.921 --> 04:20.254
then who were you fucking?

04:20.289 --> 04:22.556
Yeah, and... hang on... more
importantly, do you get points

04:22.591 --> 04:24.224
towards your total
travel hook-up points total?

04:24.259 --> 04:25.659
I mean, does it count
if you don't disclose?

04:25.694 --> 04:26.861
Because I think not.
I think not.

04:26.895 --> 04:28.796
Calm down.
Breathe, baby, breathe.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.164
I'm just saying
I just want to know the rules

04:30.198 --> 04:31.365
to the hook-up...
- Who hooked up with who?

04:31.400 --> 04:33.734
Do you know
what I keep smelling?

04:33.768 --> 04:35.402
Chocolate chip cookies.
Do you smell that?

04:35.437 --> 04:37.805
Yes, I do smell a bit
of chocolate chip cookies.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.873
So do I.

04:38.907 --> 04:41.676
Chocolate chip cookies
and aftershave.

04:41.710 --> 04:43.411
Yes,
like aftershave and cookies.

04:43.445 --> 04:46.181
- It's vanilla, okay?
- Are you serious?

04:46.215 --> 04:47.883
Please explain that.

04:47.917 --> 04:49.384
Would you calm down, all right?

04:49.419 --> 04:50.819
So I dab
a little bit of vanilla

04:50.853 --> 04:52.287
behind my ears
every morning... big deal.

04:52.321 --> 04:53.455
- Is that a real thing?
- Yes.

04:53.489 --> 04:55.090
Do you really do that?
Why would you do that?

04:55.125 --> 04:57.493
- For the ladies.
- I got to tell everyone.

04:57.527 --> 04:59.095
Is that fine?
And here I go.

04:59.129 --> 05:00.496
Okay, women associate...
wait a minute.

05:00.531 --> 05:02.899
Women associate the smell
of vanilla with romance...

05:02.933 --> 05:04.000
fact.
I agree, Doug.

05:04.035 --> 05:05.368
I'm slightly attracted
to you now.

05:05.402 --> 05:07.403
- Wait, really?
- Absolutely not.

05:10.474 --> 05:13.045
- Principal Gita.
- You always know it's me.

05:13.123 --> 05:14.910
Yeah, that's
called Caller I.D.

05:15.139 --> 05:17.568
- Of course, Mr. Kaan.
- Go ahead, Gita.

05:17.599 --> 05:19.400
- Well, do you have a moment?
- Yeah, go ahead.

05:19.481 --> 05:22.787
Well, maybe we should just
sit down when you can come in...

05:22.819 --> 05:24.334
please, Gita, let's go.
What is it?

05:24.356 --> 05:27.701
Ms. Calderon sent Roscoe
to the office because his outfit

05:27.724 --> 05:29.158
was distracting the children.

05:29.192 --> 05:30.859
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

05:30.894 --> 05:34.396
A group of the class
parent body wanted to put a stop

05:34.431 --> 05:38.601
to Roscoe's unrestrained
and joyous disregard

05:38.635 --> 05:41.237
for the gender-specific...
Cross-dressing...

05:41.271 --> 05:43.072
- Y-y-you really
want to do this?

05:43.106 --> 05:44.540
You think this is a good idea?

05:44.574 --> 05:47.076
Do you have any idea what you
are opening yourself up to?

05:47.110 --> 05:49.212
Principal Gita?
Can I go back to class?

05:49.246 --> 05:52.316
- Of course, dear. Go on.
- Thanks.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.151
You got my kid
in your office right now?

05:54.185 --> 05:55.986
No, I do not.
He just left the office.

05:56.021 --> 05:58.423
Mr. Kaan, I just wanted
to lob it out there,

05:58.457 --> 06:00.158
begin the dialogue...
I'm gonna lob it.

06:00.192 --> 06:01.392
Don't you worry about nothing.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.728
I'm gonna lob it
unimaginable places.

06:03.762 --> 06:05.730
It's gonna be like
a live hand grenade.

06:05.764 --> 06:07.131
This is gonna be
a lot of fun, Gita.

06:07.165 --> 06:09.132
Mr. Kaan.

06:09.167 --> 06:11.301
I wonder if, in the future,

06:11.335 --> 06:14.437
we could speak
in less militaristic terms.

06:14.471 --> 06:16.472
Mr. Kaan?

06:16.507 --> 06:18.006
- Marty?
- Fucking kidding me?

06:18.041 --> 06:19.675
Skip would love
to see you and your team

06:19.709 --> 06:21.257
when you have a minute.
Okay.

06:23.813 --> 06:25.655
- What, right now?
- Yeah.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.749
Skip to my Lou.

06:30.387 --> 06:32.726
So you,
finally gonna kiss me?

06:34.983 --> 06:36.457
No.

06:36.492 --> 06:39.210
- What's up, skip?
- I'm sorry. Was that a joke?

06:40.422 --> 06:41.780
What she just said?

06:42.364 --> 06:45.534
No.

06:45.568 --> 06:47.502
No, the kiss thing.

06:47.536 --> 06:50.572
No, I think you're actually
gonna fucking kiss me.

06:50.606 --> 06:52.040
Of course it's a joke.
O

06:52.074 --> 06:53.474
It's a locker room thing, like,

06:53.509 --> 06:55.744
with the guys,
"hey, you gonna kiss me?"

06:55.778 --> 06:57.212
Yeah, yeah, like the movie.

06:57.246 --> 06:58.847
"Kiss me."
"What?"

06:58.882 --> 07:01.233
"Kiss me, I like to be kissed
when I'm getting fucked."

07:02.118 --> 07:03.530
You mean like that?

07:04.889 --> 07:06.287
Yeah.

07:06.455 --> 07:08.046
How can we help you, sir?

07:09.594 --> 07:12.421
We have been in talks with
a very powerful sports franchise

07:12.460 --> 07:14.328
for the past few days.

07:14.362 --> 07:18.899
The Rainmaker has chosen
you and your team to drop in,

07:18.933 --> 07:21.501
very quietly,
and do some critical care.

07:22.122 --> 07:23.413
Team.

07:24.906 --> 07:28.142
The Rainmaker...

07:28.176 --> 07:31.632
Marco Pelios,
he who shall not be named.

07:32.282 --> 07:35.284
The Rainmaker is the Dalai Lama
of management consulting,

07:35.319 --> 07:36.986
which is not to say
that he's a good person,

07:37.021 --> 07:40.163
just a profoundly
effective one.

07:40.925 --> 07:42.218
Marty.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.038
Marty, Marty, Marty.

07:44.962 --> 07:47.030
We've chosen your team
for the drop-in.

07:47.064 --> 07:48.765
This is deep cover, black Ops.

07:48.799 --> 07:51.434
- I'm guessing it's Phoenix.
- How did you know that?

07:51.468 --> 07:53.410
Because his eyes
are open, skip.

07:54.605 --> 07:56.539
Marty Kaan is awake.

07:56.574 --> 07:58.842
Marty Kaan sees things in 3-D,

07:58.876 --> 08:02.312
360 degrees,
all the fucking time.

08:02.346 --> 08:04.047
- Yes, sir.
- There's been a lot of chatter

08:04.082 --> 08:05.615
about Franco
and Bridget Colmonares.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.784
- The divorce...
there's a fight over the team.

08:07.819 --> 08:09.453
And they've borrowed
against the team to the tune

08:09.487 --> 08:11.588
of $100 million, I think.
They're close friends of mine.

08:11.623 --> 08:14.592
So I'd like to see
what you can do for 'em.

08:14.626 --> 08:16.594
I mean, don't undercharge
them, for God sakes.

08:16.628 --> 08:18.930
- Fuck, no. Undercharge?
- What does that mean?

08:20.132 --> 08:21.800
Don't worry.
Don't worry about that.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.968
We're gonna help you out.
I have no doubt.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.970
Remember, this is a halo jump.

08:26.005 --> 08:29.121
"Halo"...
high altitude, low open.

08:29.808 --> 08:32.409
Management consultants love
that special forces jargon.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.946
Roger that, sir.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.674
Is somebody making cookies?

08:38.150 --> 08:40.118
Guys!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!

08:40.152 --> 08:41.785
My God, I just saw Cat Deeley

08:41.820 --> 08:43.520
getting out of a limo.
Who's Cat Deeley?

08:43.554 --> 08:45.423
What? You're joking.
Cat Deeley!

08:45.458 --> 08:47.225
The wildly successful
spokesmodel

08:47.259 --> 08:48.460
from
so you think you can dance?

08:48.494 --> 08:49.761
I love her. I love her.
Hey.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.730
- We get it... he loves her.
- Long time.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.434
I know.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.504
I need some things.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.473
Yeah.
I mean...

09:01.507 --> 09:05.277
Well, I'm in Phoenix
this week, but I...

09:05.311 --> 09:07.679
you're very sweet.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.816
Why don't you just
call me when you get to the...

09:11.850 --> 09:13.363
duh, yes.

09:17.689 --> 09:19.823
You are super funny.

09:19.858 --> 09:22.126
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.561
All right, bye.

09:23.595 --> 09:25.029
Don't start.
Start what?

09:25.063 --> 09:26.797
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say anything.

09:26.831 --> 09:28.165
- You didn't say anything.
- I didn't say a word.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.934
I think Jeannie's
incredibly mature phone manner

09:29.969 --> 09:31.469
kind of says it all.
Eat me.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.938
Did something just happen here?

09:32.972 --> 09:34.940
Pretty sure that someone
who Jeannie boinked

09:34.974 --> 09:37.176
is flying to Phoenix.
You are so...

09:37.210 --> 09:39.111
right!
You are so absolutely correct

09:39.145 --> 09:40.346
is what she's trying to say!
I haven't even talked to him

09:40.380 --> 09:42.715
since b-school.
- Not since b-school.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.251
We're just having dinner.
Whatever.

09:45.286 --> 09:47.754
'Cause I would fly to Phoenix
just to have dinner with you.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.156
Definitely.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.058
You're a child.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.027
Where do they stand?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.929
Well, you know,
the NBA's looking to move in

09:55.963 --> 09:58.331
ever since mommy and daddy's
divorce got ugly.

09:58.366 --> 10:01.234
We just have to figure out
a long-term scenario,

10:01.268 --> 10:02.435
as well as a...

10:02.470 --> 10:05.705
is that Cat Deeley?
That is Cat Deeley.

10:09.244 --> 10:11.879
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Cat?

10:11.913 --> 10:13.381
Yeah.

10:13.415 --> 10:14.582
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:14.616 --> 10:15.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:15.617 --> 10:17.586
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.355
I just...
God, I just...

10:20.390 --> 10:23.225
I just wanted to say...

10:23.260 --> 10:24.860
I just wanted to say
that I'm such a huge

10:24.894 --> 10:26.795
So you think can dance? Fan.

10:26.829 --> 10:29.364
I really am. Guilty...

10:29.398 --> 10:30.431
I just think you're great,

10:30.466 --> 10:32.567
and I...
I mean, 'cause I used to dance.

10:32.601 --> 10:34.469
- No. Stop.
- A long time ago...

10:34.503 --> 10:37.204
long before I went to Harvard.
There. My bag.

10:37.238 --> 10:38.338
That's great.

10:38.373 --> 10:40.707
You know, I have
a huge respect for dancers.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.741
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:41.776 --> 10:42.742
Yeah, me too.

10:42.777 --> 10:44.577
I mean, I did, you know,

10:44.611 --> 10:46.479
I did hip-hop and jazz and...

10:46.514 --> 10:48.748
- Don't say ballet.
- But I also kind of...

10:48.783 --> 10:50.750
- Do not say ballet.
- Focused a lot on ballet.

10:50.785 --> 10:52.118
Yeah, well,
you kind of have to.

10:52.153 --> 10:53.653
- Right, the fundamentals.
- Yeah.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.720
But I never really did tap.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.722
I always thought
that was kind of a feat.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.557
I can krump,
if you like krumping.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.325
- Really?
- Yeah, I kind of...

11:03.430 --> 11:05.164
God.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.699
Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.968
My God, are you okay?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.904
It's actually really good

11:11.939 --> 11:13.673
to see someone else
spill something for once,

11:13.707 --> 11:15.742
because, you know,
I'm such a klutz.

11:21.415 --> 11:24.917
You smell delicious, like a...

11:27.321 --> 11:29.388
Vanilla latte.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.123
I spilled some here...

11:31.157 --> 11:33.125
just all in this area,
if you want to...

11:33.159 --> 11:36.761
Attention, Virgin customers,
flight 819 is now boarding.

11:36.796 --> 11:40.298
I... I have to go.
That's my plane.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.667
- Yeah.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.836
Okay.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.271
- Say something to her.
- Help with her bags.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.240
She's got a ton of 'em.
Doug.

11:49.274 --> 11:50.608
Go say something.
Go now. Go. Go.

11:50.642 --> 11:51.609
This is your chance,
go do something.

11:51.643 --> 11:53.043
- Doug, go, go, go, go.
- Do something.

11:53.078 --> 11:55.478
- Doug, go pick up a bag.
- Go help her with her bags.

11:55.513 --> 11:57.680
Are you kidding me?
Nice to meet you.

11:57.715 --> 12:00.316
I'm Cat.

12:00.350 --> 12:03.218
- I...
- Physical contact, here we go.

12:03.253 --> 12:06.255
Flesh to flesh.

12:08.224 --> 12:12.362
So...

12:12.396 --> 12:14.330
No, say your name.
Say your name.

12:14.365 --> 12:20.003
Say your name.
Doug Guggenheim...

12:20.038 --> 12:22.039
- I mean...
- Don't look at me.

12:22.073 --> 12:23.340
It can't be real.
That wasn't real.

12:23.374 --> 12:25.342
God, my balls are scorched.

12:25.377 --> 12:28.045
You are so much worse
than I thought.

12:28.079 --> 12:29.579
No.

12:29.614 --> 12:31.814
I think I came.

12:31.849 --> 12:34.450
It says right here
the league may just seize

12:34.484 --> 12:36.685
and sell the Huskies.

12:36.720 --> 12:41.390
Shit, man, that is one
big, fat asset to blow.

12:41.425 --> 12:42.625
Don't.

12:42.659 --> 12:44.092
You blew it with
the dime piece of all time.

12:44.127 --> 12:46.228
And she was rich.

12:46.262 --> 12:47.696
And she dug you.

12:47.731 --> 12:50.332
God, she patted my balls.

12:50.366 --> 12:52.901
God, I just love her so much.

12:52.935 --> 12:55.938
It's gonna be okay.
Show me where she patted you.

12:55.972 --> 12:57.506
Show me with my hand
where she patted you.

12:57.540 --> 12:58.874
- I'm not gonna show you.
- I'll just grab 'em.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.877
It's sacred.

13:11.422 --> 13:14.391
- Let's see what we got up here.
- It's probably gonna be nasty.

13:14.425 --> 13:16.527
I hate it when mommy
and daddy fight.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.196
I just want it to be like
when we were all a family.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.098
Why can't daddy
come live with us?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.400
'Cause daddy made
a baby with the housekeeper.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.468
Daddy.

13:24.502 --> 13:26.737
We're just gonna
install ourselves

13:26.771 --> 13:28.405
as the necessary mediators
in this clusterfuck.

13:28.439 --> 13:29.939
They're gonna be
in a siege mentality,

13:29.974 --> 13:32.308
so we just have to swoop in
and be the liberators.

13:32.342 --> 13:34.210
I talked to a pal of mine
who says that the league

13:34.244 --> 13:36.045
is circling right now.
We got about a day

13:36.079 --> 13:37.480
to see if there's
anything here to salvage.

13:37.514 --> 13:39.081
Then we better rip and roll.

13:46.122 --> 13:47.656
- You're late.
- Late?

13:47.690 --> 13:50.325
Yes, sir, actually,
we're ten minutes early,

13:50.359 --> 13:52.427
but you don't have to worry
about any of that anymore,

13:52.461 --> 13:53.662
because we're here now.

13:53.696 --> 13:55.097
We're here
to restore your team,

13:55.131 --> 13:57.599
your entire organization,
to its former glory

13:57.633 --> 13:59.668
and make it better
than it's ever been.

13:59.702 --> 14:01.003
The past is dead.

14:01.037 --> 14:02.304
We're creating the future,

14:02.338 --> 14:05.007
starting right here, right now.

14:05.041 --> 14:06.909
I'm Marty Kaan...
these are my colleagues

14:06.943 --> 14:08.711
from Galweather Stearn,
and it is time for you

14:08.745 --> 14:11.514
to hand the bullshit to us
and get back to the business

14:11.548 --> 14:13.415
of winning championships.
He's too good.

14:13.449 --> 14:17.086
- And we're an hour late.
- And you must be Bridget.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.522
Marco told me to extend
a very special hello to you.

14:20.556 --> 14:22.290
And he speaks
so highly of you, Marty.

14:22.325 --> 14:24.393
She doesn't know Marco
the way I know Marco.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.662
Marco's my best friend.
I thought that you alienated

14:26.697 --> 14:29.365
or fucked all your friends
and employees.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.967
This is what I'm talking about.

14:31.002 --> 14:33.170
She cannot continue
to slander me Willy-nilly.

14:33.204 --> 14:35.940
I forget. Is it slander
if it's 100% true?

14:35.975 --> 14:39.210
I mean, if I accuse him
of serial whore-banging

14:39.245 --> 14:41.713
and fathering a child with
our housekeeper of 20 years,

14:41.747 --> 14:43.448
is that slander?

14:43.482 --> 14:45.816
Well, it... I don't know
if it's the technical...

14:45.851 --> 14:47.351
- Room for interpretation.
- There's probably text on it.

14:47.385 --> 14:48.886
I mean, it's a good question.
We can find out.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.987
What's another word for cunt?

14:51.022 --> 14:53.490
There's so many, honestly.

14:53.524 --> 14:56.493
I'm not sure. Anywhere
you put your filthy junk?

14:56.527 --> 14:58.862
I used to stick it
in that sore of a fucking mouth

14:58.896 --> 15:00.297
you've got, bitch.
Really?

15:00.331 --> 15:02.065
Well, how about if I take it
and stick it in your ass?

15:02.099 --> 15:04.601
- Gold-digging bitch!

15:04.636 --> 15:08.338
All right, all right.
Listen, listen.

15:08.372 --> 15:10.841
I would like to take
a process check...

15:10.875 --> 15:12.109
piss...

15:12.143 --> 15:16.480
and then let's reset,
start boiling the ocean.

15:16.514 --> 15:19.851
We're gonna
get this done, okay?

15:22.722 --> 15:25.390
God, I am very uncomfortable.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.225
Honestly, Marty, I'm really
more of a numbers guy.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.027
He's right. We're not here
for marriage counseling.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.029
Is there any way we get out
of this without getting fired?

15:31.063 --> 15:32.230
Are you guys
fucking kidding me?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.399
You bunch of babies,
we just stumbled over

15:34.434 --> 15:36.035
a pile of gold bullion.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.369
They're so fucking distracted,

15:37.404 --> 15:39.205
we could practically
write their checks for them.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.240
We just got to keep this
organization out of seizure.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.009
Now, does anybody have
an I.Q. point that we can spare

15:43.043 --> 15:44.411
on this thing?

15:44.445 --> 15:46.046
Yes.
Okay, I could make up, like,

15:46.080 --> 15:48.181
a sexy excel model, show how
the team won't be bankrupted

15:48.215 --> 15:49.549
by the divorce?

15:49.583 --> 15:51.550
The team will be
bankrupted by the divorce.

15:51.585 --> 15:53.319
Get on it.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.921
Clyde, start ripping
his deck to shit.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.422
Done.

15:56.457 --> 15:59.692
"Deck"... basically a Powerpoint
presentation for the client.

15:59.727 --> 16:01.628
That's what we do...
we make Powerpoint decks,

16:01.662 --> 16:02.829
and we stuff them with numbers

16:02.863 --> 16:04.531
to sell our way
of fixing the company

16:04.565 --> 16:06.800
just enough
to sell them some more.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.668
- Doug, do me a favor.
Double-check these numbers

16:08.703 --> 16:09.769
for me real quick.
Yeah.

16:09.804 --> 16:11.938
Does that make sense?

16:11.972 --> 16:14.507
Hey, when's this big date?

16:14.541 --> 16:16.475
Tonight, and it's not a date.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.711
It's a date.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.449
So awesome to see you.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.918
It's really awesome
to see you too.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.488
You look... awesome.
You do.

16:31.225 --> 16:33.727
I hear this food
is actually really good,

16:33.761 --> 16:36.463
and my hotel room is...
It's pretty nice.

16:36.497 --> 16:39.166
For Phoenix.

16:39.201 --> 16:42.470
I hear that you are just
shredding it at Galweather.

16:43.905 --> 16:46.473
Well, it's very nice
to hear that you heard that.

16:46.508 --> 16:48.208
Yeah.
All my sources are like,

16:48.243 --> 16:50.877
"dude, she is all
over that shit."

16:50.912 --> 16:52.379
What do you
mean your "sources"?

16:52.413 --> 16:54.180
Just people
I talk to at Catrell.

16:54.215 --> 16:56.115
- Catrell...
the head-hunting firm?

16:56.150 --> 16:58.484
Yeah. That Catrell.

16:58.519 --> 17:02.154
You know people over there?

17:04.891 --> 17:07.893
Shit.
What?

17:10.731 --> 17:13.566
- I-I work there.

17:13.601 --> 17:16.202
I work at Catrell.
I'm a headhunter.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.502
That's why I called you.
Yeah.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.005
I thought you were looking
to make a move.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.540
Yeah.
No, I know. I know...

17:21.575 --> 17:24.011
yes, I know you're a headhunter,
but I thought...

17:24.045 --> 17:26.079
for some reason, I thought you
worked at Boseman.

17:26.114 --> 17:28.115
No.
Fuck Boseman.

17:28.150 --> 17:31.719
I hate those pricks.

17:35.024 --> 17:39.527
So...
What's the job?

17:41.864 --> 17:43.664
So this is a primo opportunity.

17:43.699 --> 17:46.133
Okay, you drop right in
at project manager level.

17:46.168 --> 17:49.304
If you stick that landing...

17:49.338 --> 17:52.206
Fast track to partner.

17:52.241 --> 17:55.810
Yeah, I'm on a pretty fast
track to partner at Galweather.

17:55.844 --> 17:59.814
Working under Marty Kaan?
Are you kidding me, Jeannie?

17:59.848 --> 18:03.852
That guy is a fucking sociopath.
Marty the con man?

18:03.886 --> 18:06.421
The only thing he's ever
promoted is his own legend.

18:11.193 --> 18:13.468
I'm prepared
to make a prelim tonight.

18:14.030 --> 18:16.331
Well, then now we're talking.

18:16.366 --> 18:19.268
- Shouldn't we be drinking?
- Yes. Paid for by Catrell.

18:19.302 --> 18:20.398
Thank you.

18:22.739 --> 18:24.773
You know,
the numbers aren't that bad.

18:24.808 --> 18:26.675
I mean, you know,
if it weren't for the divorce,

18:26.709 --> 18:27.910
they could probably
just gut it out.

18:27.944 --> 18:29.478
- Seriously?
- Yeah, but hang on.

18:29.513 --> 18:32.181
With the divorce,
it's fucking armageddon.

18:32.215 --> 18:34.516
Look what she's hitting him
with on the team buyout.

18:34.551 --> 18:36.918
Where's the $100 million that
vanishes off the spreadsheet?

18:36.953 --> 18:39.521
Yeah, good question.
Not really clear.

18:39.556 --> 18:41.457
I mean, it kind of
gets transferred around,

18:41.491 --> 18:44.460
goes into operating costs.
No, where does it zero out?

18:44.494 --> 18:45.827
Give me a second.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.134
- Y-y-you're back
after the date?

18:52.168 --> 18:54.036
That's...
that's not a good sign.

18:54.070 --> 18:56.605
Can we please skip the part
where you mercilessly skewer me?

18:56.640 --> 18:58.073
I don't think there's a chance.

18:58.108 --> 19:00.142
I don't think we can.
I'm so sorry, but we can't.

19:00.176 --> 19:02.244
He is a fucking headhunter.

19:02.278 --> 19:04.146
That's crazy,
'cause I'm constantly

19:04.180 --> 19:05.447
looking for head also...
all the time.

19:05.482 --> 19:06.682
- No.
- Now's not the time.

19:06.716 --> 19:07.816
From Catrell?

19:07.851 --> 19:09.318
It's actually
a decent offer too.

19:09.353 --> 19:11.320
The only good thing...
Who's the headhunter?

19:11.355 --> 19:12.655
Derek Fielder.

19:12.689 --> 19:14.624
Let me get this through
my head, just real quick.

19:14.658 --> 19:16.993
So you thought
it was a date, right?

19:17.027 --> 19:18.728
But he just wanted you
for your mind?

19:18.762 --> 19:21.330
That is so sad.

19:21.365 --> 19:24.333
- From you? Really?
- What does that mean?

19:24.367 --> 19:25.668
- What does that...
- What does that mean?

19:25.702 --> 19:27.269
What does that mean?

19:27.304 --> 19:29.338
Were you not there
with your penis this morning?

19:29.372 --> 19:31.506
You came all over the inside
of your fucking pants.

19:31.541 --> 19:33.841
God damn it, Clyde!

19:33.875 --> 19:35.509
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

19:35.544 --> 19:37.311
All right, I'm fine.
I'm fine. You know what?

19:37.345 --> 19:38.945
If you're so
fucking smart, Clyde...

19:38.980 --> 19:40.013
Yeah.

19:40.047 --> 19:41.214
Then how would
you bag Cat Deeley?

19:41.249 --> 19:43.583
You're asking
how I would bag Cat Deeley?

19:43.617 --> 19:45.852
- That's right. You.
- Easily, that's how.

19:45.886 --> 19:47.254
All right, well,
if it's so easy,

19:47.288 --> 19:49.423
let's make it interesting, then.
My God.

19:49.457 --> 19:51.158
This is gonna be
the easiest money.

19:51.193 --> 19:52.259
I'm on Clyde.

19:52.294 --> 19:53.828
Okay, you want to do this?

19:53.862 --> 19:55.196
Critical assumptions?
Data dump?

19:55.230 --> 19:56.530
Put 'em up.
- No. No, no, no.

19:56.565 --> 19:57.665
You get nothing.
You get none of that.

19:57.699 --> 19:59.267
You get what I got,
which is zero, okay?

19:59.302 --> 20:01.303
You're just Clyde Oberhold,
you're the lowly analyst

20:01.337 --> 20:03.038
for the number-two
consulting firm in the country.

20:03.072 --> 20:05.307
You've just got to close. Go.
All I got to do is close.

20:05.341 --> 20:06.775
I don't have to get her grandma
to fall in love

20:06.810 --> 20:08.176
with me or anything like that?
No.

20:08.211 --> 20:10.412
Are you fucking kidding me?
You just have to fuck her.

20:10.446 --> 20:12.447
Jesus, he's stalling.
Stop stalling.

20:12.482 --> 20:14.283
Here I go.
I rent a sick ride.

20:15.519 --> 20:17.320
- Like a one-of-a-kind
sick ride.

20:17.354 --> 20:18.889
- So cliche.
- No, come on.

20:18.923 --> 20:20.790
I find her favorite hang,
and I just live there.

20:20.825 --> 20:22.725
Live there? You don't have
the rest of your life.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.394
You didn't give me
a time limit, Doug.

20:24.428 --> 20:25.528
- Fuck, Clyde!
- You didn't.

20:25.563 --> 20:26.663
- All right.
- She sees the ride, right?

20:26.697 --> 20:28.665
And it's like
a vintage Aston-Martin.

20:28.699 --> 20:30.166
Do you see this thing?

20:30.201 --> 20:33.136
I cultivate an air
of interesting...

20:33.170 --> 20:34.971
Interesting
international money.

20:35.006 --> 20:36.673
All money's
interesting, baby boy.

20:36.707 --> 20:38.742
- Not to Cat fucking Deeley.
- Touche.

20:38.776 --> 20:41.410
But then this is...
this is the big part...

20:41.445 --> 20:44.447
The big part...That...

20:44.481 --> 20:48.084
What's going on?

20:48.118 --> 20:50.720
- I cry loudly...
- What?

20:50.754 --> 20:53.289
After a phone call.

20:53.323 --> 20:57.293
See, my...
My sister just died,

20:57.327 --> 21:00.263
and I was raised by a sister,
so I'm more evolved.

21:00.297 --> 21:01.331
Sweetie.

21:01.365 --> 21:02.865
Shit, man, I didn't know that.

21:02.899 --> 21:05.568
- Doing the fucking thing, man.
- Doug!

21:05.602 --> 21:07.536
Shit, I'm sorry.
That was very good.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.771
- She comforts me.
- Yes, she does.

21:09.806 --> 21:11.540
Yeah, for maybe,
like, 30 seconds, am I right?

21:11.575 --> 21:15.311
Well, game over.
Whereupon I tell her my sister

21:15.345 --> 21:18.113
would be so proud and happy
that I've secured a fund

21:18.147 --> 21:19.381
for $200 million

21:19.415 --> 21:21.817
to make interesting,
character-driven movies.

21:21.851 --> 21:25.454
Holy shit.
Wait a second.

21:25.488 --> 21:28.857
Hold up.
You're not an actress, are you?

21:28.891 --> 21:30.591
Well, I mean, not primarily,

21:30.626 --> 21:32.260
but a little bit, yeah.
My God, that accent.

21:32.294 --> 21:34.162
It's amazing.
It's from the Midlands.

21:34.196 --> 21:35.630
- It's perfect.
- Thank you.

21:35.664 --> 21:38.032
There's this role.
It's sensitive, selfless...

21:38.067 --> 21:40.335
former drug addict...
it's like Ghandi meets

21:40.369 --> 21:41.903
Little Mermaid
meets the notebook.

21:41.937 --> 21:44.238
Vagina, vagina, vagina, vagina.

21:44.273 --> 21:45.239
Sure.

21:45.273 --> 21:46.373
- You know what?
- What?

21:46.408 --> 21:47.641
We should get dinner
and talk about it.

21:47.676 --> 21:49.643
- I don't know, I...
- Fuck!

21:49.678 --> 21:50.978
I'm going to Istanbul tomorrow.

21:51.013 --> 21:52.880
I help all those homeless
kittens find whiskers.

21:52.914 --> 21:54.415
- Push it back.
- They got to be saved.

21:54.449 --> 21:57.451
They got to be saved.
I'm so sorry, I can't.

21:57.486 --> 21:59.287
Don't let it be over.

21:59.321 --> 22:00.821
- But it's not over.
- It's not?

22:00.856 --> 22:02.956
No.
How about this?

22:02.990 --> 22:04.824
Why don't you just come to
my suite tonight at L'Ermitage?

22:04.859 --> 22:06.960
- I-I-I don't know.
It's all moving so fast.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.563
It's a safe space.
I promise you.

22:09.597 --> 22:11.732
We'll just look at each other.
We'll laugh.

22:11.766 --> 22:15.535
We'll talk about things.
I love to laugh.

22:15.569 --> 22:17.804
This role is so you.

22:17.838 --> 22:20.040
I mean, I can feel it
in my heart.

22:20.074 --> 22:22.341
And I know that Amelia...
Wha... who's Amelia?

22:22.376 --> 22:23.509
Sister.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.844
Sister, I'm sorry.
I'll remember.

22:24.878 --> 22:26.845
My God, I can't believe it.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.513
- What?
- She's here right now.

22:28.547 --> 22:32.517
She's saying yes.
Yes.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.619
She's saying yes.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.187
- Yes.
- Yeah!

22:36.221 --> 22:37.955
- Yes!
- You said yes originally,

22:37.989 --> 22:39.590
and that's why I take money.

22:39.624 --> 22:41.125
And he felt a little hard,
by the way.

22:41.159 --> 22:43.962
- I'm hard.
- So am I.

22:54.241 --> 22:56.209
Doug, I will
stab you in the face.

22:56.243 --> 22:57.644
It's 5:00
in the fucking morning.

22:57.678 --> 22:58.812
Listen to me, can I come in?

22:58.846 --> 23:00.347
- No! You can't come in.
- Okay. Listen.

23:00.381 --> 23:02.649
The 100 million
that we couldn't find?

23:02.684 --> 23:04.951
- Yeah?
- I found it.

23:04.985 --> 23:07.287
It was in an offshore account.
He tried to bury it.

23:07.321 --> 23:09.455
- What the fuck?
- I almost missed it.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.625
- Okay. Yeah, w-wake up
Clyde and Jeannie.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.892
- Yeah, of course.
- Hey, Doug.

23:13.927 --> 23:14.960
- Yeah?
- Good job, man.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.061
Okay.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.537
Why the hell
are we meeting out here?

23:26.572 --> 23:28.707
I love this arena.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.742
Love, love, love it.
Don't you guys love this arena?

23:30.777 --> 23:32.477
- Unbelievable.
- Beautiful.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.247
How much of your worth is here?

23:35.282 --> 23:37.617
I mean,
just how leveraged are you?

23:37.651 --> 23:39.920
Well, with the divorce
and everything,

23:39.954 --> 23:41.388
this is pretty much it.
Really?

23:41.423 --> 23:43.190
- Yeah. I'm all-in.

23:43.225 --> 23:45.359
Well, I just got off the phone
with the commissioner's office,

23:45.394 --> 23:47.895
and they're about to step in
and seize all of it.

23:47.929 --> 23:49.430
Team, Husky-dawgs, t-shirts...

23:49.464 --> 23:51.165
I've been over this
with my lawyers,

23:51.199 --> 23:52.600
they can't seize
all my assets...

23:52.634 --> 23:54.035
it'd be great if you
could take a really long look,

23:54.069 --> 23:56.203
'cause it's happening today.
We read the order.

23:56.238 --> 23:58.039
You'll actually be barred
from the premises,

23:58.073 --> 24:00.007
so take one last look around.

24:00.041 --> 24:02.343
And after we disclose
the 100 million

24:02.377 --> 24:05.813
that you have sitting offshore,
you actually will be broke...

24:05.847 --> 24:07.181
and we got to disclose.

24:07.215 --> 24:09.917
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

24:09.952 --> 24:13.921
Now, of course, if that money
went back into the team...

24:13.956 --> 24:16.023
She would get it all
in the divorce.

24:16.058 --> 24:17.691
I'd rather fucking burn
the money than give it

24:17.726 --> 24:19.259
to that bitch.
The commissioner,

24:19.294 --> 24:20.527
when he asked me
if I believed in God,

24:20.562 --> 24:21.695
which I thought
was a strange question

24:21.730 --> 24:23.097
coming from
a basketball commissioner,

24:23.131 --> 24:26.766
but then he went on to say,
because it would take a miracle

24:26.800 --> 24:28.768
to stop this seizure
from going down.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.236
So let's give him a miracle.

24:30.270 --> 24:31.637
You and Bridget
are getting back together.

24:31.672 --> 24:33.439
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Hear me out. Hear me out.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.241
- It's a fake-onciliation.
- Fake-onciliation.

24:36.275 --> 24:39.244
We're going to construct
a public reconciliation

24:39.279 --> 24:41.680
between the two of you,
but, privately, you will

24:41.714 --> 24:45.050
completely remain autonomous,
personally, financially.

24:45.085 --> 24:47.085
I have already
spoken to Bridget.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.288
She's very savvy,
but she's willing,

24:49.322 --> 24:51.390
as long as the parameters
are airtight.

24:51.424 --> 24:53.158
We make the announcement
in two hours.

24:53.193 --> 24:56.095
Your legal department will draw
up the temporary contracts.

24:56.130 --> 24:58.631
Now, I suggest you two
figure out something really nice

24:58.666 --> 25:02.035
to say to each other when
the satellite trucks show up.

25:02.069 --> 25:04.404
I'm pleased to announce
that Bridget and I

25:04.438 --> 25:06.672
are remaining together...

25:06.707 --> 25:10.076
- As co-owners
of the Phoenix Huskies.

25:10.110 --> 25:13.278
We would like
to thank the fans...

25:13.313 --> 25:14.813
- Yeah!
- There it is.

25:14.848 --> 25:17.849
Drink! Drink! Drink!

25:17.884 --> 25:22.721
Tiny bottles!
Tiny bottles!

25:22.755 --> 25:25.924
And... and we can now
focus our attention

25:25.958 --> 25:29.528
on the upcoming season...

25:29.562 --> 25:34.233
- So this job offer...
- Yeah, right.

25:34.268 --> 25:36.036
What's up with that?
You gonna take it?

25:36.070 --> 25:40.908
- It's project manager
at Collins-Swain. Should I?

25:40.942 --> 25:42.509
I don't know.
It's a nice title,

25:42.544 --> 25:45.813
but it's
a very second-tier firm.

25:45.847 --> 25:48.082
What's the money like?

25:48.116 --> 25:52.019
Double what I'm making.

25:52.053 --> 25:55.155
Take it.

25:55.190 --> 25:58.291
I was seriously considering it.

25:58.325 --> 26:02.061
I honestly was, and then
something very strange happened.

26:02.096 --> 26:04.764
They withdrew the offer.

26:07.367 --> 26:09.669
Marty.

26:11.939 --> 26:13.673
- Did you kill it?
- Did...

26:13.708 --> 26:17.844
did you kill it, Marty?

26:17.878 --> 26:19.979
Jeannie, if you were me, how
would you answer that question...

26:20.013 --> 26:23.783
honestly?
Yeah.

26:23.817 --> 26:25.952
Why would I kill the offer?

26:25.987 --> 26:28.923
Because I value you
and I want you to stay, right?

26:28.957 --> 26:32.260
So then why would I drive you
away by turning around

26:32.294 --> 26:34.796
and admitting that I killed
your more lucrative offer?

26:34.830 --> 26:38.200
That doesn't make
a lot of sense, does it?

26:38.234 --> 26:41.237
- That's fucked up, Marty.
- Isn't it?

27:00.922 --> 27:03.290
The kid is nice, son!

27:03.324 --> 27:05.225
Just running around
killing things?

27:05.260 --> 27:07.862
And you can talk to them
while you do it.

27:07.896 --> 27:09.530
Like that!
Good shot.

27:09.565 --> 27:10.665
That's terrible.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.467
You should hear
what he's saying.

27:12.502 --> 27:14.536
Take the headset off.

27:17.507 --> 27:18.975
Couldn't pay me
to play that game.

27:19.009 --> 27:22.779
Is somebody paying you
to distract us?

27:22.813 --> 27:25.281
I'm out.
Lights out in ten, buddy.

27:25.316 --> 27:29.118
- Good night, grandpa.
- Night, pops.

27:29.153 --> 27:33.656
- Hey, dad,
what's a Fudge-packer?

27:33.690 --> 27:35.391
A fud...
why are you asking me that?

27:35.425 --> 27:37.826
Well, Dylan Sanborn said
at lunch that I was little...

27:37.860 --> 27:38.827
Dylan Sanborn?
Did that kid...

27:38.861 --> 27:41.796
Ha! You're dead!

27:41.830 --> 27:43.564
