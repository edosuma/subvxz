13:42.542 --> 13:43.709
[rings]

13:45.959 --> 13:47.917
[dialing, rings]

13:47.917 --> 13:50.208
[yelling]
Oh, no.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.208
[dialing, rings]

13:57.208 --> 13:58.792
Ms. Chicarelli.

13:58.792 --> 14:01.542
It was you.
You're the one snitching
on me.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.917
That's right.
It's my responsibility

14:03.917 --> 14:07.166
to keep the cul-de-sac safe
from the likes of you,
troublemaker.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.542
We were just having fun.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.250
You were loud
and out of control.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.333
Kids are the worst thing
to ever happen to the suburbs,

14:13.333 --> 14:14.959
my suburbs.

14:14.959 --> 14:16.709
[snarling]

14:16.709 --> 14:19.375
It used to be so quiet
around here

14:19.375 --> 14:21.375
until all of you brats
moved in.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.458
That goes for you, too,
Mr. Vickle.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.792
You stop cutting those bushes
so loudly.

14:26.917 --> 14:28.583
And the next time you disrupt

14:28.583 --> 14:31.041
even one blade of grass
on this cul-de-sac,

14:31.041 --> 14:33.500
you'll be serving
a lifetime of grounding.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.125
Don't worry, Ms. Chicarelli.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.959
Kick will be
on his best behavior,

14:36.959 --> 14:38.583
right, Kick?

14:38.583 --> 14:40.959
Yes, Mom.

14:48.458 --> 14:49.750
[dials]

15:12.417 --> 15:14.667
[Kick]
Gunther, this is ridiculous.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.041
If I get caught one more time,

15:16.041 --> 15:18.000
I'm going to spend my entire
childhood locked in this room.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.625
I don't know, Kick.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.417
From what I hear,
she's been taking out kids

15:21.417 --> 15:23.208
all over the cul-de-sac.

15:34.041 --> 15:35.417
She's got to be stopped.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.125
We're getting busted
all over the place.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.041
Yeah, I guess we better stay

15:39.041 --> 15:40.875
as far away from her
as possible.

15:43.041 --> 15:45.208
[chuckles]

15:45.208 --> 15:49.125
Chicarelli's yard?
Nothing ever comes back
from Chicarelli's yard.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.125
[door opens]
[growling]

15:55.500 --> 15:57.250
Have fun getting grounded.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.166
I'll write to you
on the inside.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.208
Not.
[laughs]

16:01.208 --> 16:02.625
Doing!

16:02.625 --> 16:04.458
You really know
how to be a jerk, Brad.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.375
That's right,
and don't forget it.

16:10.083 --> 16:12.041
[whimpers]
Don't worry, Gunther.

16:12.041 --> 16:13.208
She's gunning for me.

16:13.208 --> 16:14.417
She won't be expecting you.

16:14.417 --> 16:15.750
[sighs]

16:15.750 --> 16:17.542
So let me just make sure
I got the plan.

16:17.542 --> 16:19.125
You want me to shimmy
over the shrub,

16:19.125 --> 16:20.375
move stealthily
through the yard,

16:20.375 --> 16:21.417
duck behind the tree,

16:21.417 --> 16:22.917
slip over the trashcan,

16:22.917 --> 16:25.000
avoid detection
and subsequent butt biting
by Oscar,

16:25.000 --> 16:26.166
grab Ol' Blue,

16:26.166 --> 16:27.834
move stealthily back
through the yard,

16:27.834 --> 16:30.125
and then shimmy
back over the shrub?

16:30.125 --> 16:31.834
Okay, here goes nothing.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.041
One for the money,
two for the show,

16:34.041 --> 16:35.166
three to get ready,
and four--

16:37.375 --> 16:38.709
I'm sorry, Gunther.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.041
When you getting out?

16:40.041 --> 16:42.166
My parents follow
the ancient rules of discipline

16:42.166 --> 16:43.291
from the old country.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.417
I've got at least six months
grounding left.

16:45.417 --> 16:47.208
Then I can sleep
in the house again.

16:47.208 --> 16:50.000
Gunther, we need to stop
Chicarelli's tattling,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.083
and I know just the person.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.917
Brad, have I ever told you

16:53.917 --> 16:56.041
that you're
the most annoying person
on the planet?

16:56.041 --> 16:58.208
Don't sweet talking me,
dill weed.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.750
Whatever it is,
I'm not helping you.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.500
Now, do something dumb
so I can watch you get busted.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.750
Hey, Brad, let me see
your wallet.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.417
This wallet?

17:06.417 --> 17:07.792
No chance.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.291
[laughs]

17:10.291 --> 17:11.542
Hey!

17:15.667 --> 17:17.542
That's it. Huh?

17:17.542 --> 17:19.208
[growling]

17:22.291 --> 17:25.125
[chuckles]
Just a little brotherly love.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.917
[growling]

17:26.917 --> 17:28.208
For crying out loud,

17:28.208 --> 17:30.166
I can't even pound you
without getting busted

17:30.166 --> 17:31.166
by that old bat.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.583
That's why I came to you.

17:32.583 --> 17:34.291
What are we going to do?
Shh.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.000
It's not safe here.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.291
Let's meet somewhere
we can talk.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.375
[Brad]
Man, I can't wait
to get her back.

17:42.375 --> 17:45.166
Me, too.
That tattling has got to stop,

17:45.166 --> 17:46.208
and it's not just us.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.125
She's got
the whole cul-de-sac on edge.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.583
[trickling]

17:55.583 --> 17:56.875
Okay, I'm listening.

17:56.875 --> 18:00.166
We need to focus in
on what really drives her crazy.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.709
If there's anything
I'm an expert at,

18:01.709 --> 18:03.417
it's driving people crazy,

18:03.417 --> 18:09.083
and I'd say
I'm looking at grade A,
number one annoyance.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.208
Be serious, Brad.

18:10.208 --> 18:12.166
I am. Who annoys her
more than you?

18:12.166 --> 18:14.500
And if a little bit of you
sends her over the edge,

18:14.500 --> 18:17.542
then what we need is
to give her a whole lot more.

18:17.542 --> 18:18.750
Hmm.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.291
I like the way you think.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.208
Huh?

18:24.709 --> 18:26.250
It's so peaceful,

18:26.250 --> 18:27.917
so quiet,

18:27.917 --> 18:30.125
so beautiful.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.875
No loud noises.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.000
No children playing.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.792
Nothing on fire.

18:34.792 --> 18:38.125
Peace and quiet at last.

18:38.125 --> 18:40.250
[rumbling]
Huh?

18:42.125 --> 18:43.917
[screeches]

18:46.583 --> 18:48.083
[growls]

18:51.083 --> 18:54.208
You just bought yourself
a lifetime grounding,
Clarence Buttowksi.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.375
[Tarzan yell]

18:57.375 --> 18:59.834
The trash, mixing
with the recycling.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.500
Wait till I tell your mother.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.333
[rattling]

19:05.333 --> 19:06.792
Two Kicks?

19:06.792 --> 19:08.375
Boo.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.750
[screams]

19:08.375 --> 19:09.750
Hi-ya.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.542
[crash]

19:15.750 --> 19:18.125
Sh. No time to explain.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.291
Just come with me.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.208
What's that?

19:22.625 --> 19:24.583
Fine. They can come, too.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.250
[screams]
[kids yelling]

19:26.250 --> 19:30.041
He's everywhere.
He's everywhere.

19:30.041 --> 19:31.417
He's-- He's everywhere.

19:31.417 --> 19:32.458
Everywhere!

19:32.458 --> 19:34.250
[screaming]

19:36.542 --> 19:39.000
What's going on?

19:41.959 --> 19:44.875
Yes? Uh, Ms. Chicarelli.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.792
Mrs. Buttowski,
at this very moment

19:46.792 --> 19:48.458
that boy of yours
is disturbing the peace

19:48.458 --> 19:50.959
and ruining the sanctity
of the entire neighborhood,

19:50.959 --> 19:52.125
and he's breaking trashcans

19:52.125 --> 19:53.542
and buzzing around,
crashing into things

19:53.542 --> 19:54.709
and wasting water.

19:54.709 --> 19:58.250
He's-- That boy
is driving me crazy,

19:58.250 --> 20:00.291
and he should be grounded
because of his menacing,

20:00.291 --> 20:02.375
and he's-- and he's--

20:02.375 --> 20:03.709
He's right there.

20:03.709 --> 20:06.041
Hey, Mom,
I'm done cleaning my room.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.125
Can I go outside and play now?

20:08.125 --> 20:11.041
Why, hello there,
Ms. Chicarelli.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.959
Very nice to see you
out and about.

20:12.959 --> 20:14.166
No-- no--

20:14.166 --> 20:15.417
Well, as you can see,

20:15.417 --> 20:18.417
Kick is here at home
helping out.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.417
There was so many of them,
I couldn't--

20:19.417 --> 20:23.375
Okay, you have a good day, now.

20:23.375 --> 20:24.667
[latch clicks]

20:24.667 --> 20:27.500
Come on, Oscar.
Kick-- uh, everywhere.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.834
[stammering]
Buttowski everywhere.

20:29.834 --> 20:30.959
Well, honey,

20:30.959 --> 20:32.792
I think I may have been
a little wrong

20:32.792 --> 20:34.542
in listening
to Ms. Chicarelli

20:34.542 --> 20:36.291
and her tales
of your trouble.

20:38.291 --> 20:41.083
Well, that put old snitchy
back in her place,

20:41.083 --> 20:42.417
and during the confusion,

20:42.417 --> 20:44.166
I was able to get
all our stuff back.

20:44.166 --> 20:46.083
Autographed photo of me?

20:46.083 --> 20:49.000
Finally my set
is complete again.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.208
Emo kid.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.500
The toupee?

20:55.500 --> 20:57.667
Uh, not quite.

20:57.667 --> 20:58.792
Uh, yup.

20:58.792 --> 21:00.709
Ah, still fits.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.166
Wallet.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.083
Hey.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.792
Nice work.

21:08.792 --> 21:10.333
You, too.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.333
Now, where were we?

21:14.583 --> 21:15.667
Wet Willie.

21:15.667 --> 21:16.875
[both yell]

21:19.709 --> 21:24.625
[howling in distance]

21:24.625 --> 21:27.125
Will you keep your dog quiet?

21:27.125 --> 21:28.458
