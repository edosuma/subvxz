00:13.114 --> 00:15.516
( groaning )

00:22.923 --> 00:25.093
Hey, now.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.596
( laughing )

00:30.664 --> 00:32.299
We called earlier,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.268
they said
you were up.

00:34.368 --> 00:38.106
Time we get here,
you back asleep.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.276
Been there long?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.844
No.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.247
20 minutes.

00:46.347 --> 00:50.918
You know, we didn't want to
exactly disturb you, you know.

00:51.018 --> 00:54.021
I'm bored is all.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.524
Yeah, but still.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.660
So, what you
got for me?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.829
Spreads?

01:01.929 --> 01:03.797
Uh, yeah.

01:09.337 --> 01:12.306
Little Man.
For sure.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.143
That's good.
Are you able to write?

01:25.052 --> 01:26.554
Okay.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.622
Number two.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.200
I can make Little Man,

01:39.300 --> 01:41.602
'cause he's
in the front,

01:41.702 --> 01:45.306
trying to snatch the cash
off the dashboard.

01:48.276 --> 01:52.613
But the other one,
he's outside in the dark.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.783
So...

01:55.883 --> 01:58.786
You know, it's okay.
It's okay.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.855
Uh, is there anyone here

02:01.955 --> 02:04.091
that you do recognize?

02:04.192 --> 02:07.661
Sure, Wee-Bey.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.702
All right.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.406
Let me tell you
where we're coming from
with the shooters.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.108
We tracked
their escape route,

02:21.209 --> 02:23.244
and Landsman came up
with their hoodies.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.980
Now, DNA matched
human hair

02:27.080 --> 02:28.649
from one of the hoodies
to Wee-Bey.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.051
Freamon, he tracked
a call from the pay phone

02:31.151 --> 02:35.022
near the scene
to Stringer Bell's pager.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.991
Now the caller was
using Bey's beeper code.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.793
Crime lab, they lift
a print off a soda can

02:42.630 --> 02:45.333
near that phone and that
matches Little Man.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.938
You know, so--
you know, I'm saying...

02:56.277 --> 02:59.747
okay, hear me out.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.516
There's a downside here.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.553
We don't
have the guns,

03:05.653 --> 03:09.590
no prints from the scene,
no witnesses.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.427
But worse,
we gonna be dealing with
a Baltimore City jury,

03:13.527 --> 03:16.564
and a good man is hard
to find in this town.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.833
12 of 'em together
especially.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.744
An ID of both
your shooters

03:30.844 --> 03:34.382
will play a whole
lot easier come trial.

03:39.887 --> 03:40.988
Yeah.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.959
Sometimes things
just gotta play hard.

03:56.437 --> 04:00.441
( theme music playing )

04:02.543 --> 04:04.878
* If you walk
through the garden *

04:06.447 --> 04:08.816
* You better
watch your back *

04:10.217 --> 04:14.187
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

04:14.288 --> 04:16.624
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

04:18.291 --> 04:21.862
* If you walk
through Jesus *

04:21.962 --> 04:25.433
* He'll save your soul

04:25.533 --> 04:29.236
* You gotta
keep the devil *

04:29.337 --> 04:32.506
* Down in the hole

04:32.606 --> 04:36.276
* All the angels sing

04:36.377 --> 04:40.381
* About Jesus' mighty soul

04:40.481 --> 04:41.915
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

04:44.284 --> 04:47.688
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

04:47.788 --> 04:51.559
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

04:51.659 --> 04:52.926
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

04:55.629 --> 04:59.266
* You got to
keep the devil *

04:59.367 --> 05:02.903
* Way down in the hole

05:10.978 --> 05:13.547
* Way down in the hole

05:14.982 --> 05:16.850
* Way down in the hole

05:18.519 --> 05:22.122
* Way down in the hole

05:22.222 --> 05:25.092
* Way down in the hole.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.835
( police radio chatter )

05:34.935 --> 05:37.471
Yeah, we got everyone
on our list except CCO.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.106
Yeah, we hit
his mama's house

05:39.206 --> 05:41.875
and she says that he went up
to Wabash for some court date,

05:41.975 --> 05:44.545
so you might wanna
get on the computer

05:44.645 --> 05:46.279
and see if any of
the sheriff's deputies

05:46.380 --> 05:48.048
can snatch him up
in some courtroom.

05:49.316 --> 05:50.684
Yeah.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.053
No, no, no,
we got Ronnie Mo.

05:53.153 --> 05:57.057
Yeah, I'm lookin' at him
go in the jail van right now.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.959
All right.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.663
Fished our limit.
Let's go home.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.532
Sir.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.066
Huh?

06:06.166 --> 06:07.501
Let's go home, sir.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.870
You're looking at
a soon-to-be-made sergeant,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.706
so what I'm saying is,
when we're around the troops,

06:12.806 --> 06:15.208
you gotta get used to
showing the proper respect.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.678
So, let's go home, sir.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.580
All right?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.963
What's the count?

06:36.063 --> 06:40.768
So far we've picked up 12,
leaves seven on the wing.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.271
Anything worthwhile?

06:44.371 --> 06:45.506
Some phone numbers
that match,

06:45.606 --> 06:47.541
scraps of nicknames,
not much else.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.042
We need something now.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.911
They're gonna shut us down
unless we come up

06:51.011 --> 06:53.113
with something fresh
to run with right now.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.347
The wires are dead.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.049
The bug on the club
is useless.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.251
They were moving out of there
even as we got up on them.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.754
- To where?
- No clue.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.823
But they're gonna
have to set up again.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.726
Either Barksdale moves
to reset his distribution

07:05.826 --> 07:07.160
or he gives up
the towers.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.061
If not Avon,
then Stringer.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.897
And why not Avon?

07:09.997 --> 07:12.566
With no priors,
he's out two hours
after the bail review.

07:12.666 --> 07:16.036
Shit, what we put on Barksdale
barely makes him break stride.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.506
Okay, so, we get a hint of
where they're setting back up,

07:18.606 --> 07:20.541
we ask the state's attorney
for a new bug,

07:20.641 --> 07:22.275
maybe even a wire
if we get onto a phone.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.244
Not while
the deputy breathes air.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.014
We'll be reassigned
before you finish typing
up your affidavit.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.716
How about the feds?

07:28.816 --> 07:31.785
You think the deputy's
gonna let you take
this mess federal?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.021
Why does the deputy
need to know?

07:34.121 --> 07:36.824
( phone ringing )

07:36.924 --> 07:39.827
McNulty, you are
a piece of work.

07:39.927 --> 07:43.130
Yeah. McNulty.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.466
Yeah?

07:49.102 --> 07:51.204
No shit.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.543
No fucking shit.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.511
It's Rhonda Pearlman,

07:57.611 --> 08:00.080
She just got a call from
an assistant public defender

08:00.180 --> 08:01.882
in North Jersey,
who claims to represent

08:01.982 --> 08:04.151
a man by the name of
D'Angelo Barksdale.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.287
Yeah, meet me in homicide.
Bring a tape recorder.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.657
No drug lawyers?
No Levy?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.995
- Case got some legs
on her, don't she?
- Don't she?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.264
Shit, a quarter of
a million dollars bail.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.899
You believe
that shit?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.701
Right, it hurts to even
show that kinda money.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.303
Yeah. Where Levy at?
He ain't at the club,
is he?

08:23.403 --> 08:24.705
Oh, hell, no,
club's out.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.540
We can't talk
there no more.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.108
C'mon, man,
let get out of here.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.912
What's up, baby?

08:35.448 --> 08:36.683
So, this is it, huh?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.318
Look, before you
go anyplace else,

08:38.418 --> 08:39.787
before you talk
anyplace else,

08:39.886 --> 08:41.121
we gotta think
this through.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.358
We're up to almost
20 arrests at last count.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.494
And if you look
at the probable cause,

08:47.595 --> 08:49.362
they all read
just like yours,

08:49.462 --> 08:51.498
information from
a confidential source.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.901
Don't this seem way
too much for one snitch?

08:54.001 --> 08:55.535
Oh, I agree.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.270
My gut tells me
a wire.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.339
Either on
a phone or two,

08:59.439 --> 09:02.409
or maybe something
in a room somewhere.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.745
You talk to your nephew
on the phone about
the Jersey thing?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.747
Naw, 'course not, man,
no phones.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.616
When I talk to him,
I talk to him face-to-face

09:08.716 --> 09:10.150
in my office
in the back of the club.

09:11.952 --> 09:12.986
Fuck.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.022
It's good you
moved out of there.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.124
I don't know, man.
I mean, if they got
a mike up in there,

09:17.224 --> 09:19.559
they got you and me sayin'
all kind of shit, man.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.495
Oh, that reminds me.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.632
He said he'd
be in tonight.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.901
Thing is, they take
you and leave me?

09:28.001 --> 09:29.637
Yeah, that's what's
fuckin' me up, too, man.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.038
Look, we'll know
soon enough,

09:31.138 --> 09:32.706
as soon as I start
pressing for discovery.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.441
In the meantime,
what do you wanna do

09:34.541 --> 09:35.709
about the people
they locked up?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.377
We gotta pull 'em.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.046
That's showing
a lot of money.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.649
Well, if we don't,
we run the risk of
makin' them enemies.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.517
Speaking of which,
where are you with
your nephew?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.654
Is he gonna see
the light or what?

09:46.754 --> 09:49.122
Let me tell you
something, man.
He family, a'ight?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.624
He not gonna buck.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.592
A day or two
in a New Jersey bullpen,

09:52.693 --> 09:55.863
he gonna be cryin',
waitin' for bail money,
like the rest of 'em.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.230
All right.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.167
So, let's run the money
through the families,

10:00.267 --> 10:01.468
that'll hide it some.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.170
And don't use
the same bondsman.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.571
All right.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.073
Now, look, gentlemen,
I know it's early,

10:06.173 --> 10:08.041
but I want you
to start thinking
about who was charged

10:08.141 --> 10:09.977
and what kind of time
they can do.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.445
One of the ways
to limit your exposure

10:12.545 --> 10:14.081
is what's called
a structured plea.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.350
That means that you're gonna
have to deliver your people,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.820
all of them,
down to a man.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.323
I saw your girl today
for the idents.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.159
How's she doin'?

10:26.259 --> 10:27.861
Okay, I guess.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.563
She's out
of the ICU.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.700
Movin' slow,
but movin', you know?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.467
( phone ringing )

10:34.567 --> 10:37.705
Jimmy, you ain't
been to see her?

10:37.805 --> 10:39.306
No, I couldn't go in.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.742
This ain't
about you, right?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.345
I get back
from Jersey, I will.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.084
I will.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.888
You know, Cole and me,
we showed her the spreads.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.057
Picked out Little Man
no problem.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.927
Wouldn't go for Wee-Bey,
so I tried the fat finger.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.962
Damn near
down on my knees,

11:02.062 --> 11:03.731
begging her to make
this play easier in court.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.598
You know
what she said?

11:05.699 --> 11:07.267
"Sometimes things
gotta play hard."

11:08.568 --> 11:10.904
( laughs )

11:11.004 --> 11:13.807
- Real police.
- Oh, yeah.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.785
What the fuck
did you do to her?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.653
I don't know.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.922
You two
in the same car

11:29.022 --> 11:31.191
gonna make for a long-ass
drive to Jersey.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.293
Shit.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.445
Is this mahogany?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.248
This is a mahogany
front, sir.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.885
( organ music playing )

12:10.430 --> 12:14.802
Damn, man, it's just--
it's too still in here.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.542
( children shouting )

12:22.642 --> 12:26.213
Slow down.
Slow down some.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.284
You know what?

12:31.384 --> 12:32.752
We can--

12:35.923 --> 12:37.791
This place'll
be fine.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.592
All we really
gotta do, man,

12:39.692 --> 12:41.061
is put a little safe
in here someplace

12:41.161 --> 12:43.630
and let 'em know the count
comes here from now on.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.598
- Period.
- All right.

12:45.698 --> 12:49.569
Damn, boy, when y'all
change up, y'all--

12:49.669 --> 12:51.338
Shh.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.806
Y'all that
paranoid?

12:52.906 --> 12:54.707
You ain't even been
up in there before.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.844
I'm tellin' you, sis,
this shit is different.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.812
We are not gonna talk
about nothing indoors.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.280
It's a new day.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.816
Thing is, man, we gotta
get back on our feet.

13:02.916 --> 13:03.984
You know what
I'm talking about?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.518
I mean, the longer
we hold off,

13:05.618 --> 13:07.087
the harder it's gonna be for
us to maintain them towers.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.688
You want
to get it back up,

13:08.788 --> 13:10.457
you lean to me
and String here.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.125
No, I ain't down yet.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.827
- You need to step back.
- She's right, bro.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.762
You can't take
a second chance here,

13:15.863 --> 13:17.364
you know
what I'm saying?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.000
Until you fixed,
sis gonna handle that money,

13:20.100 --> 13:21.668
I'm gonna handle
that products.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.736
- We here for you.
- A'ight.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.273
But you tell Roberto,

13:26.373 --> 13:28.175
he gotta make it
a serious smoker.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.177
I mean, I want them
motherfuckin' fiends
in the projects,

13:30.277 --> 13:32.612
I want them droppin'
like flies. You feel me?

13:32.712 --> 13:34.281
You send out the word,

13:34.381 --> 13:36.283
you let 'em know
we ain't dead yet.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.486
What about my nephew?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.221
Don't fret.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.223
Give me a chance
to get with Roberto,

13:43.323 --> 13:45.425
then I'll get up to Dee,
do what needs doing.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.295
Tell him,

13:48.395 --> 13:50.597
I'm sorry for puttin' him
out there like that.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.166
And that I'm gonna
make it up to him.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.434
Oh, you gonna
make it up.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.038
Mos def.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.745
Woman:
But again, I want
to make it clear

14:05.845 --> 14:08.916
that all of this cooperation
is contingent on a commitment

14:09.016 --> 14:11.051
that my client
finds acceptable.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.786
Failing that,
everything said in here

14:13.887 --> 14:16.023
- stays in here.
- Damn straight.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.424
I'm sure
a proffer in Maryland

14:17.524 --> 14:19.226
plays much the same
in Jersey, counselor.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.528
And I do agree that
with regard to matters

14:21.628 --> 14:24.231
involving drug trafficking,
your client has been helpful.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.766
He's indicated
a willingness to testify

14:26.866 --> 14:28.501
that he was
a lieutenant

14:28.601 --> 14:31.304
in Avon Barksdale's
drug distribution
organization,

14:31.404 --> 14:34.141
sold large quantities
of drugs for his uncle,

14:34.241 --> 14:37.077
delivered money, attended
organizational meetings,

14:37.177 --> 14:38.745
and on one occasion,

14:38.845 --> 14:41.148
made a trip to New York
on the behest of his uncle.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.217
All of which corroborates
much of what we already know.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.485
Well, what else
is there?

14:47.620 --> 14:49.589
The murders.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.692
Man, why you
keep on that, huh?

14:52.792 --> 14:54.427
I already told you,

14:54.527 --> 14:56.663
I don't know nothin' about
that witness bein' killed.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.966
Which witness?

14:59.066 --> 15:01.634
Remember her?

15:01.734 --> 15:04.671
Jesus.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.406
They did her?

15:06.506 --> 15:08.241
Yeah, about the same time
they did the boy.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.652
All them bodies.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.292
They coverin' up, man.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.994
Yeah, that's
what we think.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.295
No loose ends.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.896
I can understand
the guard.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.166
She got paid,
so she had to go.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.035
Orlando,
he knew too much,

15:35.135 --> 15:36.736
got to snitchin',
so he had to go.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.806
But then
there's the kid...

15:39.906 --> 15:43.410
Wallace.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.213
Man:
But I need to go past
Argyle Street tonight.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.181
- Check in with Wallace.
- Woman: Wallace?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.550
Man:
He off the hook since
we helped the tower crew

15:50.650 --> 15:52.119
get that stick-up boy.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.720
I'm tellin' you, man,
Wallace is buggin'.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.755
Don't hardly even come out
of that room no more.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.524
Woman:
Why he be like that?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.559
Man:
I'm thinkin' he might
be gettin' high.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.262
- Wallace?
- The boy's scarin' me
with his shit.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.998
- All right,
holler at me later.
- That'll work.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.133
( dial tone )

16:06.233 --> 16:08.668
You got that shit
on tape?

16:08.768 --> 16:10.637
Mm-hmm.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.942
God!

16:16.043 --> 16:17.477
Bunk:
His name is
Brandon Wright.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.013
Burned him, broke fingers,
gouged an eye out.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.414
All kinds of fun.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.551
Dee:
Wallace was
the one who saw.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.188
He saw the boy.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.558
But he really ain't
think about what they'd do.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.093
You must have known.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.262
You were standing there
by that pay phone.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.596
You knew.

16:36.696 --> 16:37.964
What was
I gonna do, huh?

16:38.065 --> 16:40.833
I don't call String,
the word get back uptown,

16:40.933 --> 16:42.135
what's gonna
happen then?

16:42.235 --> 16:44.971
So, you told Wallace
to wait,

16:45.072 --> 16:46.973
then you called Stringer,
and Stringer,

16:47.074 --> 16:48.441
he gathered the troops.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.143
Yeah.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.844
And down
at the Greek's,

16:51.944 --> 16:53.980
they got Wallace to point
the finger, right?

16:54.081 --> 16:55.415
And then they went in
like cops with handcuffs,

16:55.515 --> 16:57.016
so they could take
their time on Brandon.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.153
They dropped the body
where we'd see it.

17:00.253 --> 17:04.424
"Send a message
to the 'jects," they said.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.326
Wallace...

17:06.425 --> 17:09.128
he couldn't
handle that.

17:09.229 --> 17:12.031
After seeing that,
he wanted to get out.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.300
Go back to school.

17:14.401 --> 17:17.737
We even
joked about it,

17:17.837 --> 17:19.972
him being 16 and all,

17:20.073 --> 17:23.410
needin' to go start back
over again as a freshman.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.012
And about a week ago,
my uncle and String,

17:26.113 --> 17:28.181
they call me
down to the club.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.950
Stringer, he's all worried
about Wallace and I told him.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.786
I said, "Wallace
ain't no snitch."

17:33.886 --> 17:37.124
Plus, he's out
the fucking game.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.992
I told him that.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.695
But I needed
to do more.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.465
I should've done more...

17:47.033 --> 17:49.169
but I didn't, and...

17:49.269 --> 17:51.037
fuck, that's on me.

17:51.138 --> 17:54.807
Any idea who
they sent at Wallace?

17:57.144 --> 18:00.180
C'mon, Dee,
wild guess.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.250
Man, I don't know.
Could've been anybody.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.917
You know,
shooters come cheap.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.253
I don't think so.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.455
Not in the pit.
Not in his crib.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.923
I counted seven beds
when I was up there.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.492
Where were
the young'uns?

18:12.592 --> 18:16.196
Look, if I knew,
I would tell you.

18:16.296 --> 18:19.866
A'ight, I swear to God,
I would tell you.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.804
They've been
charged with Orlando
and the undercover cop,

18:24.904 --> 18:27.640
but we're
still hunting.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.580
Him, he in Philly.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.882
How you know?

18:35.982 --> 18:37.484
I know 'cause
I dropped him there.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.052
- Where?
- I don't know.
Some corner, man.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.621
Northend, I don't know
where he be stayin'.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.491
Did Wee-Bey say anything
to you about the shootings?

18:44.591 --> 18:45.758
We don't talk shop
in a car.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.196
It's a rule we got.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.166
So, is that it?

18:53.266 --> 18:57.003
Your client must realize
that any agreement

18:57.103 --> 18:59.572
is dependent
on his full cooperation.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.442
Well, yo,
there ain't nothin' else.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.219
Deidre.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.788
( knocks )

19:16.889 --> 19:18.758
Tap, tap, tap.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.628
( knocks )

19:24.464 --> 19:26.566
She was one of
my uncle's girls.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.269
Yeah, but we got people
who put you with her
the night she's killed.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.971
Yeah, I didn't know
they was gonna do her.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.741
I swear.
They played me.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.643
How so?

19:40.380 --> 19:42.282
My uncle gave me
an eight ball of coke.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.816
Told me to take it
over there to her.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.787
I was surprised,
'cause, you know,

19:47.887 --> 19:49.422
I thought
he dumped her.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.023
But he said, naw,
it wasn't like that
no more.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.726
So, he had Wee-Bey
take me over there.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.596
You know, I walked up,
knocked on the door,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.631
she came to the door
all naked and shit

19:58.731 --> 20:00.367
with this
little-ass robe on.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.701
So, she's your
uncle's girl,

20:01.801 --> 20:03.403
but she comes to
the door for you naked?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.838
She used to do that shit
with me all the time, man.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.441
Teasin'.
You know how girls do.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.177
- Maybe you don't.
- ( McNulty laughs )

20:11.278 --> 20:12.979
I don't know.

20:13.079 --> 20:17.350
Anyway, I'm like,
"Ain't you gonna
let me come in?"

20:17.450 --> 20:19.652
She's like, naw,
because she gotta get ready

20:19.752 --> 20:21.454
for my uncle
to come by later.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.123
So, I give her
the coke.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.459
She laughs about how
she's gonna put that shit

20:26.559 --> 20:28.461
on ice
for later on.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.598
- Refrigerator.
- Uh-huh.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.600
I don't know shit
about no refrigerator.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.635
Like I said,
I didn't go in.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.471
So, I turned around,
started walkin' back
to the truck,

20:38.571 --> 20:40.039
and I heard
this shot.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.608
Wee-Bey,
he come runnin' back

20:41.708 --> 20:43.643
with this big-ass .45
he like to use so much.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.046
Tells me how he was tappin'
on the window real soft.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.382
How with the lights on,
she had to walk all the way up,

20:49.482 --> 20:51.884
'cause she couldn't see
what was on the outside.

20:51.984 --> 20:55.822
And when she gets up
to the window and looks out...

21:04.331 --> 21:05.932
You did good,
D'Angelo.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.501
Yeah, you did.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.752
Y'all don't
understand, man.

21:25.852 --> 21:29.121
Y'all don't get it.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.991
You grow up
in this shit.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.927
My grandfather
was Butch Stamford.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.765
You know
who Butch Stamford
was in this town?

21:38.865 --> 21:41.000
Mm-hmm.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.269
All my people, man,

21:43.370 --> 21:46.539
my father, my uncles,
my cousins.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.009
It's just
what we do.

21:51.344 --> 21:55.482
You just live
with this shit

21:55.582 --> 21:58.651
until you can't
breathe no more.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.588
I swear to God,

22:01.688 --> 22:04.791
I was courtside
for eight months

22:04.891 --> 22:09.829
and I was freer in jail
than I was at home.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.800
What are you
looking for?

22:15.668 --> 22:19.038
- I want it to go away.
- I can't...

22:19.138 --> 22:22.041
I want what
Wallace wanted.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.076
I want
to start over.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.178
That's what I want.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.147
I don't care where.
Anywhere.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.049
I don't give a fuck.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.451
I just want
to go somewhere

22:31.551 --> 22:34.554
where I can breathe
like regular folk.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.557
You give me that...

22:38.658 --> 22:41.594
and I'll give
you them.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.067
No, that's great.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.702
Really great.

22:50.770 --> 22:51.971
Yeah.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.675
That's our move.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.577
Mm-hmm.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.782
Okay.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.693
We broke it open
tonight.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.327
Wide open.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.730
I'm bringing
this case in big.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.170
So, this squares things
with Burrell, right?

23:28.374 --> 23:30.209
To hell with the man.

23:30.309 --> 23:32.812
But I think we might have
enough to reach out to the feds,

23:32.912 --> 23:34.981
try to run this thing
through them.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.182
Cedric.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.117
He knows about
the money, Marla.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.887
He's known
for a long while.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.489
Fact is, I wouldn't
be surprised

23:42.589 --> 23:44.891
if it's why he picked me
for this case.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.927
Well, what does he--

23:48.027 --> 23:49.596
what are you gonna--

23:49.696 --> 23:51.197
He's got me
if he wants me.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.099
Thing is, I don't
think he wants me.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.101
Too much stink,

23:55.201 --> 23:57.837
too much mess.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.044
Kinda like this case.

24:08.014 --> 24:11.584
I have to admit it, Jimmy,
this is a great case.

24:11.684 --> 24:12.985
I mean, not just
because of Greggs,

24:13.085 --> 24:14.954
because it goes to that
and answers that,

24:15.054 --> 24:17.657
but because--
because of how deep it goes.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.627
I mean, the murders,
the money--

24:20.727 --> 24:23.362
Jesus, I feel like
I've been drunk

24:23.462 --> 24:25.131
ever since that kid
starting talking to us.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.999
You okay to drive?

24:27.099 --> 24:28.535
I can drop you home
and you can pick up
your car tomorrow.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.770
No, I'm good.
I'm good.

24:30.870 --> 24:34.541
I'm great.
This was fucking great!

24:34.641 --> 24:37.409
You want to try
to go federal with this?

24:37.510 --> 24:39.178
I am up for it.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.747
I get cross-designated
as an AUSA

24:40.847 --> 24:44.183
and we can really
run with it, you know?

24:46.052 --> 24:48.921
Career fucking case.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.228
Anyway...

25:01.868 --> 25:03.402
Ronnie.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.672
The thing at, um...

25:05.772 --> 25:07.974
Levy's the other day,

25:08.074 --> 25:10.743
I was, uh-- I was--

25:19.485 --> 25:21.420
Jesus, Ronnie,
not here.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.989
What are you doing?

25:23.089 --> 25:26.258
Like you never did it
in the headquarters
garage before?

25:28.127 --> 25:30.229
( laughing )

25:36.502 --> 25:39.271
( tires screeching )

25:44.644 --> 25:46.679
Jesus,
Mary and Joseph.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.248
Look what just walked in
without a fucking escort.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.317
Downtown Roy Brown.

25:51.417 --> 25:54.621
The living legend
in his own mind.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.357
Uptown Lester Freamon.

25:58.457 --> 26:00.727
Fuck me,
how long's it been?

26:00.827 --> 26:02.862
Your retirement party,
wasn't it?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.897
And this is
retirement, huh?

26:04.997 --> 26:07.099
Yeah.
Nice fuckin' digs, huh?

26:07.199 --> 26:10.169
Ask my supervisor when
I'll see a little sunlight.

26:10.269 --> 26:13.873
Runt cocksucker says,
"when your unit
turns a profit."

26:13.973 --> 26:18.611
But enough of my joy,
what do you guys need?

26:18.711 --> 26:21.213
We need a trap
and trace.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.015
But not in Maryland.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.817
Pennsylvania, Philly.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.619
You gotta
go through them.

26:26.719 --> 26:27.987
No, we try that,
we lose a week,

26:28.087 --> 26:29.789
them tellin' us
it can't be done,

26:29.889 --> 26:31.758
then another week
for their attorneys
to okay our subpoena.

26:31.858 --> 26:33.259
Plus, it's a little
more complicated

26:33.359 --> 26:34.794
than just
a straight-up trace.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.829
We actually need a list
of phones in Philly

26:36.929 --> 26:38.631
that called this number
in the past week.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.567
Well, what's the number?

26:41.668 --> 26:43.636
Drug lawyer,
downtown office.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.939
Thought billing be
the place to look.

26:47.039 --> 26:50.176
Well, if we could do it,
and I'm not sayin' we can,

26:50.276 --> 26:52.178
it's gonna be
a fuckin' week,
maybe two.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.849
Thanks, Roy.

26:56.949 --> 27:00.186
Hey, Lester, isn't this
supposed to be the time

27:00.286 --> 27:02.889
you tell me how
all-fired fuckin'
important this is?

27:09.095 --> 27:11.698
The Philly number
gives us the mope

27:11.798 --> 27:14.300
who shot that
female undercover.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.208
McNulty:
I'm tellin' you, Fitz,
it's the perfect case.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.576
- You'll love it.
- Well, it sounds great.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.045
But like I said,
Jimmy,

27:26.145 --> 27:28.347
we're not fishing
for drug cases anymore.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.016
Try DEA.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.819
No, that field office
is too close to our CID.

27:32.919 --> 27:34.987
We go there, our bosses
know it before a meeting
is scheduled.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.924
Your bosses don't know
you're doing this?

27:40.793 --> 27:42.161
Who'll be coming?

27:42.261 --> 27:45.564
Me, a detective name
of Freamon and Daniels.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.233
I can speak
for Daniels, brother.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.336
He's played this thing
out with real heart.

27:50.436 --> 27:54.206
C'mon,
set something up.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.810
All right.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.816
( door opening )

28:07.686 --> 28:09.521
Could I get
10 copies?

28:09.621 --> 28:11.090
10 copies?

28:11.190 --> 28:13.092
10, right.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.098
( machine beeping )

28:23.235 --> 28:25.037
No problems?

28:25.137 --> 28:26.338
No.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.340
Money?

28:34.113 --> 28:37.383
All right, man,
I'll get at you.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.893
Yo, you locked
that door, right?

28:46.993 --> 28:49.461
Yeah?
Alright, so, listen.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.363
It's not street-ready,
all right?

28:51.463 --> 28:53.766
So, everybody
gotta work on their
own cut and vial up.

28:53.866 --> 28:57.269
Now, listen to me,
tell 'em to get
this straight.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.706
Three parts
of this, all right?

29:00.807 --> 29:03.175
To one of raw,
alright?

29:03.275 --> 29:06.045
And that's how we gonna do
until we get the new stash.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.780
And I want you to put
the word out there

29:07.880 --> 29:09.882
that we back up.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.785
Understand me?
We back up.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.821
It's a good target.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.923
You guys have
a pretty good case here.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.858
Look at
the violence alone.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.794
It's at least a dozen murders,
including state's witnesses.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.596
If you can help us
squeeze the Barksdale kid

29:24.696 --> 29:25.965
into a witness
protection program,

29:26.065 --> 29:27.666
we can run wild
with this thing.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.068
No suppliers though.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.170
We're still looking
for a way into that.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.373
There was nothing on the wire
that took us toward New York.

29:34.473 --> 29:35.942
The trouble is,

29:36.042 --> 29:38.777
we have these post
911 protocols.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.247
We can't pick up
any new narcotics work

29:41.347 --> 29:44.583
unless it goes to priority
organized-crime targets.

29:44.683 --> 29:46.652
Meaning Cosa Nostra
or Colombians.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.187
Or Russians maybe.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.522
Well, we don't have any
Colombians in Baltimore.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.958
Yeah, we don't
have any wiseguys.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.826
All we got is
a whole lot of locals

29:53.926 --> 29:55.394
a little busy tearing
the Westside apart.

29:55.494 --> 29:58.330
I hear you,
but the bureau-wide
protocol applies.

29:58.430 --> 30:02.001
To run with you on this,
we need a recognized
OC target,

30:02.101 --> 30:05.104
or even better, a connect
to counterterrorism
or corruption.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.839
You go near stuff
like that,

30:06.939 --> 30:08.941
we have something
we can bring to our ASAC.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.943
What kind
of corruption?

30:11.043 --> 30:14.346
Don't know,
what kind you got?

30:16.782 --> 30:17.816
( rap music playing )

30:17.917 --> 30:20.586
- Yo, Poot!
- We up yet?

30:20.686 --> 30:21.988
Where Roc-Roc at
with the shit?

30:22.088 --> 30:24.723
Package in.
Who is it?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.392
Onion and them
off-brand niggas.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.594
Onion?

30:28.694 --> 30:30.162
The fuck
they got?

30:30.262 --> 30:32.464
Some shit they call
yellow tops.

30:32.564 --> 30:33.966
Yellow tops?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.469
Man: Got them
yellow tops, y'all.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.205
Yellow tops.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.278
Yellow tops. Yellow tops.
Got them yellow tops.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.948
Motherfucker,
what the fuck is up?!

30:49.048 --> 30:50.582
Huh?!
Fuck is y'all doin'?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.284
Yo, do what you feel.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.486
But be ready to finish
what you start.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.156
What is you doin'?
This ain't no open market,
you know that.

30:57.256 --> 30:58.857
Ain't no market
at all, nigga.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.092
You ain't got
shit to sell.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.427
Back that ass up
for those that do.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.962
- You know what?
- What?!

31:03.062 --> 31:05.697
Fuck you.
Get the fuck
out of here, bitch!

31:05.797 --> 31:08.901
( shouting )

31:11.003 --> 31:12.771
See, that's why
we can't win.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.941
Why not?

31:15.041 --> 31:17.876
They fuck up,
they get beat.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.512
We fuck up,
they give us pensions.

31:21.780 --> 31:24.416
Get the fuck
outta here!

31:33.625 --> 31:36.095
( knocking )

31:42.434 --> 31:45.437
Heard you ain't much
as an eyeball witness.

31:47.139 --> 31:50.176
Bad as any civilian.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.677
Guess so.

31:51.777 --> 31:54.213
( clearing throat )

31:55.581 --> 31:57.583
Where we at?

31:57.683 --> 31:59.418
With what?

31:59.518 --> 32:01.853
With the case, fool.

32:01.954 --> 32:05.391
Jesus,
give it a rest.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.293
What's on the wire?

32:11.097 --> 32:13.832
- Come on, man.
- Wire's dead.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.069
They changed up after
we hit 'em with raids.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.971
Daniels didn't tell you?

32:19.071 --> 32:21.740
Hell, no.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.543
He only talks to me
about the good shit.

32:24.643 --> 32:28.014
About how y'all were onto
my shooters and stuff.

32:28.114 --> 32:31.017
Yeah, well, yeah,
we lost the wire,

32:31.117 --> 32:33.019
but the good news
is D'Angelo's flipped

32:33.119 --> 32:35.321
and we're talking
to the feds about maybe--

32:35.421 --> 32:37.956
Fuck both y'all.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.963
She wants me to quit.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.168
Says there ain't
nothing worth this.

32:49.268 --> 32:52.404
So, I promised her
I'd think about it.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.275
Well, what do you say?

32:58.510 --> 33:00.979
I don't know.

33:01.080 --> 33:05.351
I guess you should do
what you need to.

33:06.852 --> 33:09.488
But she's right...

33:09.588 --> 33:12.158
it isn't worth it.

33:13.959 --> 33:16.528
No?

33:17.796 --> 33:18.930
Yeah.

33:19.031 --> 33:21.400
Probably not.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.575
Anyway, what took you
so long getting up in here?

33:31.277 --> 33:32.578
Shit, no cards,
no flowers.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.883
I mean,
what the fuck, Jimmy?

33:37.983 --> 33:40.419
I couldn't.
I, uh...

33:40.519 --> 33:44.456
I felt, uh...

33:44.556 --> 33:47.193
a case like this,
it's always you or Sydnor

33:47.293 --> 33:51.097
or some other black cop
who ends up going undercover.

33:55.534 --> 33:59.305
I swear, if I could
do it over...

34:02.908 --> 34:04.676
if I...

34:04.776 --> 34:07.779
If I could
do it over,

34:07.879 --> 34:10.581
you know
what I'd do?

34:12.918 --> 34:16.655
Put more tape
on that fucking gun.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.592
I'm sorry, Kima.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.364
I'm sorry.

34:26.465 --> 34:31.103
Anyway, since
I got you up in here

34:31.203 --> 34:33.139
acting like
my bitch and shit,

34:33.239 --> 34:37.074
with all your guilty-ass
cryin' and whatnot...

34:40.179 --> 34:42.281
maybe you can
do something for me.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.649
She said you were
doin' good.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.119
Said she was
proud of you.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.556
How she doin'?

34:51.657 --> 34:54.293
Still shook.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.229
But she wanted you
to have that.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.665
And told me
to tell you she's sorry
to be late with it.

35:00.899 --> 35:03.369
Girl got such heart,
you know?

35:03.469 --> 35:05.837
Yeah.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.343
This is enough for what
I got goin' now, man.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.680
You, uh, you give
the rest back to her.

35:16.182 --> 35:17.883
Are you sure?

35:27.259 --> 35:29.195
Give her my love.

35:30.061 --> 35:31.397
Right.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.701
Hey, McNutty.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.807
Don't tell her.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.950
- What you got, man?
- Over there, man.

35:52.050 --> 35:54.019
Un-fucking-believable.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.687
Five guys got jumped.

35:55.787 --> 35:56.955
Not just you.

35:57.055 --> 35:58.690
Four other guys
jumped me.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.192
I'm sorry, man.

36:00.292 --> 36:03.094
It's gotta be all
the brutality complaints.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.130
Which means it ain't
never gonna matter

36:05.231 --> 36:06.632
how well I do on
no fucking test.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.200
You don't know that.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.701
You might make
the next list, you know?

36:09.801 --> 36:11.503
You don't know.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.873
Guess I ain't
leadership material.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.542
Well, congratulations, Carv.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.143
Thanks.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.745
( phone ringing )

36:19.845 --> 36:21.713
Yeah?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.866
The world is
on its ass.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.972
Guy called for you
from the phone company.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.607
Says he's got
the number you wanted

36:48.707 --> 36:50.342
for a house
in Philadelphia.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.478
Beautiful,
thank you.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.752
Good casework.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.053
Thank you.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.622
I don't think
I'm giving anything away

37:03.722 --> 37:06.358
by telling that Arnold
here has had a file
on Senator Davis

37:06.458 --> 37:07.526
for two
and a half years.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.328
It took us
a while to see it,

37:09.428 --> 37:11.330
but the quid-pro-quo
is right there

37:11.430 --> 37:13.231
in that Westside
redevelopment mess.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.801
Barksdale or his fronts
grease enough city politicians

37:17.202 --> 37:19.004
and word comes back
years in advance,

37:19.104 --> 37:20.939
where the development
zone's gonna be.

37:21.039 --> 37:23.442
He buys up every piece
of garbage real estate he can,

37:23.542 --> 37:26.144
flips it three or four times,
exaggerating the values.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.713
And now the city's gonna
pay him millions

37:27.813 --> 37:30.248
to condemn the properties
for the renewal project.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.918
It's a lot to work with,
but we're willing.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.620
The question is,

37:34.720 --> 37:36.622
can your cooperator
give us the senator?

37:36.722 --> 37:38.524
Or any other
political figure?

37:38.624 --> 37:41.560
- The cooperator?
- D'Angelo Barksdale.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.929
What does he have
for us on the money?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.302
Nothing.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.438
He gives you the drugs
and the violence.

37:52.538 --> 37:55.307
He gives you
Avon Barksdale.
Stringer Bell.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.142
And they give us
the senator.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.578
- Maybe, yeah.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.813
You're talking about
turning Barksdale and Bell
into cooperators

38:01.913 --> 38:04.049
and making the politicians
the primary target?

38:04.149 --> 38:05.451
Of course.

38:05.551 --> 38:06.852
No, fuck
the politicians.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.587
Just Barksdale
and Bell.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.256
Those guys have
turned West Baltimore
into a free-fire zone.

38:11.357 --> 38:12.991
No one's saying
they walk.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.327
But what you are saying
s that if we bring you
guys the case,

38:15.427 --> 38:17.596
it's your intention
to let Barksdale and Bell

38:17.696 --> 38:19.665
reduce any sentence
they get through
cooperation, huh?

38:19.765 --> 38:21.367
Jesus Christ,
are you kidding?

38:21.467 --> 38:23.469
You're seeing
all this ass-backwards.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.836
Detective,
in this office,

38:24.936 --> 38:26.905
we have a mandate to pursue
political corruption.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.340
Can you believe
these guys?

38:28.440 --> 38:30.308
- Jimmy, look...
- What?

38:30.409 --> 38:32.944
Drugs and murder don't
cut it anymore, huh?

38:33.044 --> 38:34.646
Well, how 'bout
terrorism?

38:34.746 --> 38:37.148
These guys have
dropped 14, 15 bodies.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.750
The witnesses,
cooperators...

38:38.850 --> 38:41.353
That kind of hyperbole doesn't
serve anyone, Detective.

38:51.697 --> 38:54.265
I think we're going with
a different direction on this.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.569
Thank you
for your time.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.440
West Baltimore is dying
and you empty suits

39:01.540 --> 39:05.010
are running around trying
to pin some politician's
pelt to the wall.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.782
Thought you was
real police, brother.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.734
( chattering )

39:36.307 --> 39:39.277
So, they got you
all the way out here, huh?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.947
I started out thinkin'
you was in Jersey.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.115
You ain't in Jersey,

39:44.215 --> 39:47.018
I figure they still got you
down in central booking.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.922
All the way out here.

39:51.022 --> 39:51.957
Do send a message though.

39:53.659 --> 39:56.327
Yeah, well,
a message needs sending.

39:56.428 --> 39:59.431
How y'all
even find me?

40:00.999 --> 40:03.802
Ain't no one gonna keep
a mother from her son, right?

40:09.407 --> 40:13.078
You know, he's always
talkin' family.

40:13.178 --> 40:16.448
"Family is the heart,"
he say.

40:16.548 --> 40:20.719
Well, I'm family,
ain't I?

40:22.353 --> 40:25.090
Well, what about me
for once?

40:26.291 --> 40:28.259
It ain't right.

40:28.359 --> 40:30.195
What's right?

40:30.295 --> 40:31.663
Hmm?

40:31.763 --> 40:32.998
You like for him
to step up,

40:34.733 --> 40:37.402
take all the weight
and let you walk?

40:37.503 --> 40:39.070
'Cause he will.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.606
You know he will.

40:40.706 --> 40:43.141
But if he gotta
go away,

40:43.241 --> 40:46.011
that mean you got to step
up and fill his shoes.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.213
You ready for that?

40:48.313 --> 40:50.448
Ma, you know
I ain't.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.150
I ain't ready

40:52.250 --> 40:53.819
and I ain't never gonna
be ready for this game.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.420
Dee, come on.

40:55.521 --> 40:59.224
Look, they giving me
a chance to walk away,

40:59.324 --> 41:01.893
to start again
someplace else.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.664
And what you
givin' them?

41:11.937 --> 41:13.505
Look...

41:15.340 --> 41:19.044
he messed up, Dee,
he knows it.

41:19.144 --> 41:22.881
Now if you want to get even
with him, you can.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.050
But you hurt him,
you hurt this whole family.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.119
All of us.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.488
Me and Trina
and the cousins.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.190
And Donette, too.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.325
And your baby.

41:34.425 --> 41:37.295
Your own baby boy.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.064
This right here is
part of the game, Dee.

41:40.365 --> 41:42.167
And without the game,

41:42.267 --> 41:44.435
this whole family would be
down in the fuckin' terrace,

41:44.536 --> 41:45.937
livin' off scraps.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.806
Shit, we probably
wouldn't even be a family.

41:49.575 --> 41:51.810
Start over, huh?

41:51.910 --> 41:55.280
How the fuck you gonna start
over without your peoples,

41:55.380 --> 41:58.817
without your
own child even?

42:02.387 --> 42:04.823
You ain't got family
in this world,

42:04.923 --> 42:07.659
what the hell
you got?

42:09.294 --> 42:10.796
( cocking gun )

42:11.930 --> 42:14.165
This motherfucker
Wee-Bey twitches,

42:14.265 --> 42:15.934
there won't even
be a trial.

42:17.803 --> 42:20.238
Detective Carver,

42:20.338 --> 42:21.840
a word?

42:28.546 --> 42:31.082
Shut the door.

42:40.692 --> 42:43.561
What's up, LT?

42:44.730 --> 42:47.098
Anything you want
to tell me?

42:50.035 --> 42:52.570
Been weeks now.

42:52.671 --> 42:55.473
The deputy ops knows what's
going on in this unit

42:55.573 --> 42:58.209
almost before I do.

42:58.309 --> 43:00.078
Except last week,

43:00.178 --> 43:02.914
we run the bug up into
Barksdale's club office

43:03.014 --> 43:05.016
and Burrell,

43:05.116 --> 43:07.953
for once,
he's a step behind.

43:08.053 --> 43:11.122
You see it?

43:11.222 --> 43:14.425
Maybe, he...

43:14.525 --> 43:16.662
I see it.

43:16.762 --> 43:19.998
I look around the office
and I see that one
of my people

43:20.098 --> 43:22.100
is at the academy
for in-service.

43:26.537 --> 43:28.974
Lieutenant, I swear,
it wasn't my idea.

43:29.074 --> 43:31.743
I mean, I'm minding
my business, doin'
my fuckin' job,

43:31.843 --> 43:33.712
when the man calls
me upstairs for coffee
and a Danish, right?

43:33.812 --> 43:37.382
I mean, I never even
been on the eighth floor
of that fucking building.

43:37.482 --> 43:39.685
And there's
the deputy fucking ops

43:39.785 --> 43:42.387
telling me how concerned
he is about the case,

43:42.487 --> 43:45.356
how he needs
to be informed.

43:47.993 --> 43:50.228
I mean, he's the deputy
fucking ops, man.

44:03.809 --> 44:06.244
Couple weeks
from now,

44:06.344 --> 44:08.079
you're gonna be in
some district somewhere

44:08.179 --> 44:11.917
with 11 or 12 uniforms
looking to you for everything.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.954
And some of them
are gonna be good police.

44:16.054 --> 44:18.757
Some of them are gonna
be young and stupid.

44:18.857 --> 44:20.892
A few are gonna be
pieces of shit.

44:20.992 --> 44:24.763
But all of them
will take their cue from you.

44:24.863 --> 44:28.834
You show loyalty,
they learn loyalty.

44:28.934 --> 44:31.202
You show them
it's about the work,
it'll be about the work.

44:31.302 --> 44:33.604
You show them
some other kinda game,

44:33.705 --> 44:35.373
then that's the game
they'll play.

44:45.083 --> 44:47.252
I came on
in the Eastern,

44:47.352 --> 44:50.856
and there was
a piece-of-shit lieutenant
hoping to be a captain,

44:50.956 --> 44:52.991
piece-of-shit sergeants
hoping to be lieutenants.

44:53.091 --> 44:55.093
Pretty soon we had
piece-of-shit patrolmen

44:55.193 --> 44:56.728
trying to figure the job
for themselves.

44:56.828 --> 44:59.765
And some of
what happens then

44:59.865 --> 45:02.300
is hard as hell
to live down.

45:14.913 --> 45:17.148
Comes a day
you're gonna have to decide

45:17.248 --> 45:20.085
whether it's about you
or about the work.

45:33.131 --> 45:34.299
Grand jury
came in Tuesday.

45:35.633 --> 45:38.436
But you knew that, right?

45:40.839 --> 45:43.108
We're working
a flight warrant today.

45:43.208 --> 45:44.542
There's...

45:44.642 --> 45:47.779
there's a lot
to do here in-office.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.214
I'd be careful
with that, though.

45:50.515 --> 45:53.919
I understand the trigger
pull used to be light.

45:57.155 --> 45:59.958
( helicopter hovering )

46:13.038 --> 46:15.173
( car alarm blaring )

46:25.683 --> 46:27.986
Keep him down.
Keep him down.

46:29.955 --> 46:31.422
You got him?

46:31.522 --> 46:32.924
Get him up there.
Get him up.

46:33.024 --> 46:35.827
- Oh!
- Spread your legs.

46:35.927 --> 46:38.129
Bunch of
low-bottom bitches.

46:38.229 --> 46:39.230
Get his wrists.

46:39.330 --> 46:42.033
Y'all ain't have to
fuck with my ride.

46:46.938 --> 46:49.140
Motherfuckers
got lucky.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.353
( phone ringing )

47:03.554 --> 47:05.090
Yeah?

47:09.127 --> 47:12.297
Podunk lawyer in Denton's
giving the guards a hard time

47:12.397 --> 47:14.900
about moving D'Angelo
from original jurisdiction.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.903
Put the call through.

47:18.769 --> 47:20.438
Okay.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.674
Officer Mace,
ASA Pearlman.

47:23.774 --> 47:26.544
You got a problem
with the lawyer?

47:28.679 --> 47:31.516
Okay,
put the asshole on.

47:33.584 --> 47:36.187
This is he.

47:39.590 --> 47:41.559
( knocks )

47:44.996 --> 47:46.764
You do not
make it easy, Jimmy.

47:46.864 --> 47:49.700
I have to admit,
I am deeply ambivalent.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.436
Excuse me?

47:51.536 --> 47:52.737
Sit.

47:52.837 --> 47:54.940
Sit!

47:56.942 --> 47:58.309
Here.

47:58.409 --> 48:00.111
I heard from Bunk.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.446
Philly.

48:01.546 --> 48:02.914
Great work.

48:03.014 --> 48:04.916
You all did
great work.

48:05.016 --> 48:07.418
And the number of clearances
I'm looking at here,

48:07.518 --> 48:09.354
I mean, Christ,
for the first time
this year,

48:09.454 --> 48:11.222
we got the clearance
rate up over 40%.

48:11.322 --> 48:13.791
That's on
the one hand.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.427
On the other hand,
I know the deputy ops

48:16.527 --> 48:18.930
got a call from the first
deputy US attorney this morning

48:19.030 --> 48:21.432
asking whether
an asshole such as yourself

48:21.532 --> 48:23.334
really works for us.

48:23.434 --> 48:25.470
And, of course,
this is the first the deputy

48:26.904 --> 48:28.206
hears his troops are
creeping behind his back,

48:28.306 --> 48:29.840
trying to take
a case federal

48:29.941 --> 48:31.943
when they've already
been told the case is closed.

48:33.678 --> 48:35.981
You're a good detective.

48:36.081 --> 48:39.084
And I've got to admit
you got some stones on you.

48:39.184 --> 48:41.486
Did you actually call
the first deputy an empty suit?

48:42.687 --> 48:45.323
( chuckling )

48:47.558 --> 48:49.760
I want to see you
land okay, Jimmy.

48:49.860 --> 48:54.132
So, tell me,
where don't you wanna go?

48:56.667 --> 48:59.370
Levy:
You all know as well as I do
that Baltimore City jurors

48:59.470 --> 49:01.139
are capable of
just about anything.

49:01.239 --> 49:03.608
Now, look, you want to sit
around for months on end,

49:03.708 --> 49:05.743
scratching our way through
a bunch of half-heard,

49:05.843 --> 49:08.779
half-said telephone
conversations and see
how well you do,

49:08.879 --> 49:10.881
I'll certainly
respect the effort.

49:10.982 --> 49:12.417
It's not just talk
on the wire.

49:12.517 --> 49:14.719
We've got seized money
and a lot of dope on the table.

49:14.819 --> 49:16.154
And a lot
of violence.

49:16.254 --> 49:18.489
All of which stops
way short of Mr. Barksdale.

49:18.589 --> 49:19.857
You know this.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.659
All of it except
for the New Jersey bust.

49:21.759 --> 49:23.328
That one he eats.

49:23.428 --> 49:25.130
Maybe he does.

49:25.230 --> 49:27.532
Maybe he pleads to one count
of attempted possession,

49:28.966 --> 49:31.136
and takes, I don't know,
maybe three, four.

49:31.236 --> 49:34.739
Maybe he can arrange
for everyone you have

49:34.839 --> 49:36.841
on those tapes
to follow suit.

49:36.941 --> 49:38.976
Maybe you get five-year
pleas from those

49:39.077 --> 49:40.778
with no prior
felony convictions,

49:40.878 --> 49:42.880
10 years for those
with one prior,

49:42.980 --> 49:44.515
15 for two or more.

49:44.615 --> 49:46.017
What about
the murders?

49:46.117 --> 49:48.686
Maybe we acknowledge
you've got Mr. Brice cold

49:48.786 --> 49:50.388
for the murder
of Orlando Blocker

49:50.488 --> 49:52.390
and the wounding
of the police officer.

49:52.490 --> 49:54.192
- Who?
- Wee-Bey.

49:54.292 --> 49:55.826
Representing Mr. Brice,

49:55.926 --> 49:58.763
I'm fairly confident that
to avoid the death penalty,

49:58.863 --> 50:01.499
he'll proffer to
at least a half dozen
of your open murders.

50:02.867 --> 50:06.204
Naming co-conspirators?
For that kind of cooperation,

50:06.304 --> 50:08.773
I'd be willing
to consider straight life.

50:08.873 --> 50:10.775
No, indeed.
I believe Mr. Brice

50:10.875 --> 50:12.810
is ready to take
sole responsibility

50:12.910 --> 50:14.379
for all of his crimes.

50:14.479 --> 50:17.815
Still, you walk away
with at least a half
dozen clearances.

50:17.915 --> 50:19.384
Assets.

50:19.484 --> 50:22.353
You take the strip club and
take whatever trucks and cars

50:22.453 --> 50:24.289
you can link
to the drug trafficking,

50:24.389 --> 50:25.856
and, of course,
whatever cash you've seized.

50:25.956 --> 50:28.159
He's got dozens
of other properties.

50:28.259 --> 50:30.695
The funeral parlor,
the towing company.

50:30.795 --> 50:33.098
No, no, you get the cars,
because you can tie them

50:33.198 --> 50:34.565
to illegal activity,

50:34.665 --> 50:36.434
but there's nothing else
in his name to take.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.536
So, you keep most of the money,
most of the real estate

50:38.636 --> 50:40.338
and Stringer Bell
stays on the street

50:40.438 --> 50:42.507
with his hand
on the throttle.

50:42.607 --> 50:45.510
If you have a charge
against Mr. Bell, file it.

50:45.610 --> 50:47.978
Otherwise,
it's my understanding
that nothing

50:48.079 --> 50:51.116
in all those hours of tape
implicates him.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.755
Three or four years
ain't enough, Maury.

50:57.855 --> 51:00.225
Not for
Avon Barksdale.

51:00.325 --> 51:01.759
No?

51:05.496 --> 51:06.464
Make an offer.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.199
Bailiff:
Part 14 of the circuit court

51:08.299 --> 51:10.067
of Baltimore City
now in session.

51:10.168 --> 51:11.302
Be seated.

51:11.402 --> 51:12.503
First up.

51:12.603 --> 51:14.772
State versus
Avon Randolph Barksdale,
Your Honor.

51:14.872 --> 51:17.342
One count of possession
with intent to distribute,

51:17.442 --> 51:19.410
to wit,
a kilogram of heroin.

51:19.510 --> 51:20.911
You have
a statement of facts?

51:21.011 --> 51:22.280
Yes, Your Honor.

51:22.380 --> 51:23.814
Mr. Barksdale is offering
a plea of guilty

51:23.914 --> 51:26.551
in exchange for a maximum
of seven years in DOC.

51:26.651 --> 51:29.120
In consideration of the
following agreed-upon facts--

51:29.220 --> 51:32.423
on or about the date
of September 17, 2002,

51:32.523 --> 51:34.559
in the jurisdiction
of Essex County, New Jersey,

51:34.659 --> 51:37.195
Trooper Robert Warren
of the Newark Barracks

51:37.295 --> 51:40.131
effected a traffic stop
on a rented Ford Taurus

51:40.231 --> 51:41.866
traveling southbound
near exit 13.

51:41.966 --> 51:44.469
That traffic stop resulted
from information gleaned

51:44.569 --> 51:46.304
from electronic surveillance
of Mr. Barksdale

51:46.404 --> 51:48.606
and his nephew,
D'Angelo Barksdale,

51:48.706 --> 51:50.641
by detectives assigned
to a special detail

51:50.741 --> 51:53.077
under the command of
a city narcotics supervisor.

51:53.178 --> 51:55.546
A search of the vehicle,
which was rented

51:55.646 --> 51:57.315
from the Avis location
at BWI Airport,

51:57.415 --> 51:59.317
revealed that a kilogram
of nearly pure heroin

51:59.417 --> 52:02.253
was concealed beneath
the spare tire in
the car trunk.

52:02.353 --> 52:03.788
In accepting
this plea,

52:03.888 --> 52:06.123
Mr. Barksdale acknowledges
his role in procuring

52:06.224 --> 52:07.758
those drugs with
the intent to dilute,

52:07.858 --> 52:10.195
package, and sell
retail amounts of heroin...

52:10.295 --> 52:13.164
Deidre Kresson,
Roland Leggett,
Toreen Boyd,

52:13.264 --> 52:14.465
all tied
to the same gun.

52:14.565 --> 52:15.933
Plus, we got
the stick-up boys,

52:16.033 --> 52:18.936
Brandon Wright,
John Bailey.

52:19.036 --> 52:20.371
With Orlando,
that makes six,

52:20.471 --> 52:22.640
plus the attempted
murder on a police.

52:22.740 --> 52:24.008
That it?

52:24.108 --> 52:26.043
I do better
if I give 'em more?

52:26.143 --> 52:28.078
Life, no parole
means what it says.

52:28.179 --> 52:29.680
This proffer keeps
you off death row,

52:29.780 --> 52:31.482
but that's
all it does.

52:31.582 --> 52:33.551
You were on
the wrong side of a cop
getting shot, Mr. Brice.

52:33.651 --> 52:36.354
You want to even dream
about straight life
for all these bodies,

52:36.454 --> 52:38.956
you gotta wake up talking
about Avon Barksdale

52:39.056 --> 52:41.158
- and Stringer Bell.
- Nah.

52:41.259 --> 52:43.494
But as to murders,
you might as well give
them what you have,

52:43.594 --> 52:46.497
because anything you leave
out is outside the deal.

52:46.597 --> 52:49.234
If they learn about it later,
they can charge you later.

52:49.334 --> 52:51.101
Fuck it then.

52:51.202 --> 52:53.204
For another pit sandwich
and some 'tater salad,

52:53.304 --> 52:55.340
I'll go a few more.

52:57.675 --> 53:00.878
- How you want that?
- Medium rare, a lot
of horseradish.

53:05.616 --> 53:07.918
All right,
I did Little Man.

53:08.018 --> 53:10.755
Thinkin' he might get weak
on that cop gettin' shot.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.657
Yeah?
Where's the body?

53:12.757 --> 53:15.260
Druid Hill.
Behind the reptile house.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.027
You get back
in them weeds,

53:17.127 --> 53:18.563
you might could find
what's left of him.

53:18.663 --> 53:21.299
All right,
that's seven.
What else you got?

53:23.100 --> 53:25.436
How 'bout them
witnesses?

53:25.536 --> 53:29.274
The security lady
and what's-his-name,

53:29.374 --> 53:31.476
the maintenance man.

53:31.576 --> 53:33.278
Gant?

53:33.378 --> 53:35.045
Yeah, Gant.

53:35.145 --> 53:37.248
You did Gant, alone?

53:41.486 --> 53:44.255
They're out of 'tater salad,
how 'bout slaw?

53:46.524 --> 53:48.759
Information gleaned
from electronic surveillance

53:48.859 --> 53:52.797
would also show that
Mr. Watkins, AKA Ronnie Mo,

53:52.897 --> 53:54.765
was integrally involved
in the distribution

53:54.865 --> 53:57.167
of heroin and cocaine
in the high-rises

53:57.268 --> 53:59.904
at 734 Fayette
and 221 North Fremont.

54:00.004 --> 54:03.007
In exchange for
his pleading guilty
to one count of conspiracy,

54:03.107 --> 54:06.777
he agrees to a sentence not
to exceed 15 years in DOC.

54:06.877 --> 54:09.714
Mr. Watkins,
who is on probation for
a drug distribution charge

54:09.814 --> 54:13.284
that was adjudicated
in Judge Prevas' court
in August 2001...

54:18.255 --> 54:20.591
Cedric, hey.

54:21.726 --> 54:23.628
Major Cantrell.

54:24.829 --> 54:25.930
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

54:26.030 --> 54:27.064
So, where they
sending you?

54:27.164 --> 54:29.066
Northwest,
Spurgeon's retiring.

54:29.166 --> 54:31.736
Yeah, I heard that
was gonna happen.

54:31.836 --> 54:33.604
You ever feel like
a change, give a yell.

54:33.704 --> 54:35.473
I could use a good
shift lieutenant.

54:35.573 --> 54:37.908
I mean, right now, the whole
fucking district's a mess.

54:38.008 --> 54:39.243
What isn't?

54:39.344 --> 54:41.946
Hey, good seeing you.

54:42.046 --> 54:43.414
You, too.

54:49.053 --> 54:51.956
Herc: You see,
this ain't no DEU.
It ain't like that.

54:52.056 --> 54:55.393
When you all came downtown,
the job changed.

54:55.493 --> 54:57.895
Down here, we make big cases,
big hairy-balled cases,

54:59.330 --> 55:01.031
like this
Barksdale thing, right?

55:01.131 --> 55:03.668
And all that mess
you call police work
down in the districts,

55:03.768 --> 55:07.104
all that fuck-somebody-up
and rip-and-run bullshit,

55:07.204 --> 55:09.340
it won't play
down here.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.409
You think I'm kidding.

55:11.509 --> 55:14.379
This is what makes cases,
gentlemen. This!

55:15.946 --> 55:17.548
Remember that.

55:32.463 --> 55:34.665
Nicely done.

55:43.574 --> 55:46.444
Motherfucker, I been here
since lunch, waitin'.

55:46.544 --> 55:49.013
Ain't nobody
been through here.

55:49.113 --> 55:50.715
You hear me?

55:50.815 --> 55:53.384
I been waitin'
and y'all ain't
about shit.

55:54.385 --> 55:56.053
Yeah, listen,
listen to me.

55:56.153 --> 55:58.923
Look, if you feel like that,
then get off this phone,

55:59.023 --> 56:01.125
come down here
and step to me then, nigga.

56:01.225 --> 56:02.893
Yeah, a'ight.

56:02.993 --> 56:06.797
Yo, if Roc-Roc ain't here
in 10 minutes with my re-up,

56:06.897 --> 56:08.999
whoop his ass, man.

56:09.099 --> 56:12.470
( radio playing )

56:23.147 --> 56:25.716
Now, I understand you did
a tour in homicide years ago,

56:25.816 --> 56:27.518
but let me tell you
how I run this unit,

56:27.618 --> 56:30.020
because how I run it
is how it runs.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.756
We work on
a strict rotation.

56:31.856 --> 56:33.223
You're up till
you catch a call,

56:33.323 --> 56:34.525
and then you step down
and work your case

56:34.625 --> 56:36.026
and someone else
steps up behind you.

56:36.126 --> 56:38.162
This is the way
we do business in a town

56:38.262 --> 56:40.465
with 250,
300 murders a year.

56:40.565 --> 56:44.234
And it works.

56:44.334 --> 56:46.103
You do not play the game
for yourself,

56:46.203 --> 56:47.638
you play it for us.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.406
If you remember
these few rules,

56:49.507 --> 56:52.510
you'll find me to be
supportive and reasonable.

56:52.610 --> 56:54.011
Very reasonable, sir.

56:54.111 --> 56:56.814
( chuckles )
That's what they say
about me.

56:56.914 --> 56:59.116
Jay:
They say that,
they do.

57:05.322 --> 57:07.157
Man:
Red tops.

57:10.294 --> 57:12.997
( rap music playing )

57:24.341 --> 57:25.810
Yo, Dink!

57:30.447 --> 57:32.683
- What the fuck was that?
- Huh?

57:32.783 --> 57:35.219
You take a nigga's money,
then you serve him?

57:35.319 --> 57:37.187
What the fuck?

57:41.492 --> 57:43.628
I'm sayin',
you take their money,

57:43.728 --> 57:46.130
then you send 'em
'round and let some
other nigga serve.

57:46.230 --> 57:47.632
The way you doin' it,

57:47.732 --> 57:50.267
someone snappin' pictures
got the whole deal.

57:50.367 --> 57:51.769
You hear?

57:57.642 --> 58:00.110
We got to tighten up
around here, yo!

58:09.086 --> 58:10.254
Jimmy.

58:11.989 --> 58:13.691
Hell of a case.

58:13.791 --> 58:15.092
Read all about it
in the papers.

58:16.260 --> 58:18.095
You done good, kiddo.

58:21.198 --> 58:24.168
I gotta--

58:31.375 --> 58:33.744
Rhonda:
D'Angelo Barksdale
supervised distribution

58:33.844 --> 58:36.446
in the low-rise
courtyards and was also
integrally involved

58:36.547 --> 58:38.649
in the violence attributed
to the organization.

58:38.749 --> 58:41.485
Further, he was arrested
by authorities in New Jersey

58:41.586 --> 58:43.520
in possession
of a kilo of raw heroin

58:43.621 --> 58:45.522
intended for distribution
in Baltimore.

58:45.623 --> 58:47.858
He acknowledges his role
as a leading conspirator

58:47.958 --> 58:51.028
and is already on parole
for two earlier counts
of distribution

58:51.128 --> 58:53.130
dating from
March 1999.

58:53.230 --> 58:54.498
What are you
asking here?

58:54.599 --> 58:56.967
As Mr. Barksdale
has two prior convictions

58:57.067 --> 58:59.269
and is insisting that
the effort to purchase

58:59.369 --> 59:01.639
and transport the kilo was
undertaken on his own behest

59:01.739 --> 59:04.909
and is refusing
to cooperate against others
in the conspiracy,

59:05.009 --> 59:06.711
the state
is offering only

59:06.811 --> 59:09.113
the maximum allowable
20 years, Your Honor.

59:09.213 --> 59:11.281
Mr. Levy...

59:11.381 --> 59:13.851
this is your understanding
of the plea agreement?

59:13.951 --> 59:14.952
Yes, sir.

59:15.052 --> 59:16.621
Very well then,
Mr. Barksdale.

59:16.721 --> 59:18.422
Can you hear me
distinctly?

59:18.522 --> 59:20.825
Dee:
Yes.

59:20.925 --> 59:23.227
- Wee-Bey, man.
- How'd it go?

59:23.327 --> 59:26.163
For life, no-parole
he puts himself
in for Orlando

59:27.732 --> 59:29.466
and the attempt murder
on Greggs.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.168
Then he also takes
Nakeisha Lyles,

59:33.570 --> 59:34.905
Deidre Kresson,

59:35.005 --> 59:37.274
the two project murders
that match that gun,

59:37.374 --> 59:38.943
both the stick-up boys,

59:39.043 --> 59:41.445
- and Little Man.
- Little Man?

59:41.545 --> 59:44.615
Yeah, body found
up behind the reptile
house in Druid Hill.

59:44.715 --> 59:48.252
He gave us that one
just for fun, I think.

59:48.352 --> 59:50.755
He also takes
William Gant.

59:52.256 --> 59:53.624
I know,
it's bullshit.

59:53.724 --> 59:55.125
Well, how'd he tell it?

59:55.225 --> 59:57.294
( sighs )
Man.

59:58.663 --> 01:00:00.564
- Boom.
- He said a contact wound?

01:00:00.665 --> 01:00:02.466
- Yeah.
- It doesn't play.

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:04.802
Gant had no compression,
no stippling.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:07.204
Wound was to the front.
Bey's talkin' out of his ass.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:10.107
I know it, but this
motherfucker's just taking
murders just to take 'em.

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:13.944
He's taking life,
no-parole for shooting
a cop, what the fuck?

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.813
Might as well
try to spring Bird
for killing Gant.

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:18.082
Bailiff :
All rise.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:48.813
Jesus, what the fuck
did I do?

01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:55.085
You happy now, bitch?

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:08.398
( music playing )

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:18.876
* Step by step

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:22.913
* All the happy saints
go marching in *

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.549
* And if the saints
step out of line *

01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:28.152
* They have
to start again *

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:30.821
* 'Cause Jacob's
golden ladder *

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:33.891
* Gets slippery
at the top *

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:36.626
* And many
a happy-go-lucky saint *

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:39.429
* Has made that
long, long drop *

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.499
* If I'm late,
don't wait *

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:45.569
* Go on without me

01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:49.339
* I may tarry awhile

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:53.577
* 'Cause I mean to know

01:01:53.677 --> 01:01:56.213
* Before I go

01:01:56.313 --> 01:02:01.218
* How come
the devil smiles... *

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:07.157
( siren blaring )

01:02:21.806 --> 01:02:24.308
( laughing )

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:29.713
* If I'm late,
don't wait *

01:02:29.814 --> 01:02:32.749
* Go on without me

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:37.054
* I may tarry awhile

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:40.624
* 'Cause I mean to know

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:43.760
* Before I go

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:48.032
* How come
the devil smiles *

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:57.307
* Free from care,
free from fear... *

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:58.843
( knocking )

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:00.811
* Children play
all around the throne *

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:03.814
* Innocent of sin

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:06.150
* A trillion voices
sing the name *

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.718
* The mortal
may not know *

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:11.721
* And heaven's wall's
too high to hear *

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:14.091
* The trouble
down below *

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:15.392
* If I'm late,
don't wait *

01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:20.464
* Go on without me

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:24.734
* I may tarry awhile

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:28.505
* 'Cause I mean to know

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:31.608
* Before I go

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.479
* How come
the devil smiles *

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:39.950
* I mean to know

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:44.221
* Before I go,
how come... *

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.390
( honking )

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:51.195
( whistling "The Farmer
In the Dell" )

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.931
Are you the man
with them jumbo sixes?

01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:56.133
How many you
fuckin' want?

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:58.568
Take about three
or four hundred.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:02.439
Damn. Puta.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:05.609
( laughs )

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:08.578
All in the game, yo.

01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:11.916
All in the game.

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:16.320
Right, but I
didn't think--

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.024
Mm, mm, mm.

01:04:20.124 --> 01:04:22.592
( laughs )
For sure.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.162
( theme music playing )

01:04:26.305 --> 01:04:32.236
